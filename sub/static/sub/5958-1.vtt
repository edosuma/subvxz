I don't think your mammy'd be
too pleased about that now.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.394
What a beautiful fuckin' day.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.920
–Who the fuck are you?
–Aidan McBride, Sergeant.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.480
–Don't know you.
–Just transferred from Dublin.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.878
Big city boy, huh?
And me just a lowly country nobody.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.036
–Lonely?
–Huh?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.913
–Lonely country nobody?
–Lowly. Lowly.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.035
Lowly. I thought you said “lonely”.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.149
Not too sharp on the uptake, are you?

03:54.640 --> 03:58.030
You'll go far in this outfit.
Fuckin' latte's my drink.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.550
They told me cappuccino.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.553
(Camera clicks)

04:04.680 --> 04:06.447
What the fuck is he doing here?

04:07.280 --> 04:11.521
–He's the scene-of-crime photographer.
–Are you soft in the head or what?

04:12.280 --> 04:15.000
Get out, Mick,
or I'll tell your mammy about you.

04:15.040 --> 04:19.511
I got what I need anyways, Gerry.
It's all good clean fun, huh?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.396
I'm worried about that young lad.

04:30.280 --> 04:34.120
He's an interest in the photographic arts
I can only describe as unhealthy.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.116
He looks like Brendan Foley.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.391
I knew his father.
He ran off with me second cousin.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.680
When I say “ran off”, he was
in a wheelchair, the old fella.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.840
He was a what, er,
what do you call it?

04:44.880 --> 04:47.519
–Er, paraplegic?
–Spastic, yeah.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.995
Wheeled off.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.680
Brendan Foley. I'll get onto this.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.950
I said he looked like Brendan Foley.
I didn't say he was Brendan Foley.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.829
Should you, er,
should you be removing those?

05:07.960 --> 05:12.511
From the Bible, looks like. I knew
there'd be a fuckin' religious angle.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.075
Aye, he was a good-looking lad.
Lovely lips.

05:19.840 --> 05:24.436
The significance of the pot plant
has me somewhat perplexed.

05:24.560 --> 05:30.032
–Maybe its genus is a clue.
–Oh, genus, huh? Fancy.

05:34.760 --> 05:39.311
–What the hell are you doing?
–I have the gift. Nobody tell you?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.112
Clairvoyant, like.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.560
Never interfered with a corpse before,
no? It's great gas.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.160
–I don't think you should…
–I'm only messing.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.680
–Lighten up!
–I don't think it was appropriate.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.998
Fuck off to America with your
“appropriate” fuckin' Barack Obama.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.588
I was just saying.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.678
–Is there any money in the house?
–What? No.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.518
I mean, I haven't checked.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.920
You haven't checked
if there's any money?

06:03.960 --> 06:07.032
What sort of a fucking guard are you,
anyways?

06:07.160 --> 06:08.991
Five and a half…

06:10.200 --> 06:11.997
Five and a half.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.636
Now what the fuck would that mean?

06:17.680 --> 06:20.274
There's a film called “8½”.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.913
Fellini.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.960
There's another film called “Se7en”.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.840
Are you going to list
a load of film titles with numbers?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.639
I can do that.
That's your idea of police work?

06:31.640 --> 06:36.509
Maybe this is the killer's
five and a half… halfth victim.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.039
Go on.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.600
Maybe he's killed four people before
now, and he's maimed another lad.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.393
Cut off his legs maybe,
which'd be the half.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.080
So this'd be victim number
five and a half.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.873
Interesting theory.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.755
So what you're saying is, we may well
have a serial killer on our hands.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.836
It's a distinct possibility.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.434
Well, that'd be a first for Galway.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.671
Rabbit.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.591
(Phone rings)

07:38.960 --> 07:41.394
Sergeant Gerry Boyle. Cop shop.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.200
Hi, little piggy. I've got information
about that murder last night.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.240
What murder?

07:46.320 --> 07:49.120
How many fucking murders
have you had in the last 24 hours?

07:49.160 --> 07:51.634
That's for us to know
and you to find out.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.115
That doesn't make any sense.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.480
Have you any information or are you
sitting there playing with yourself?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.556
What's your name? Boyle?

07:59.680 --> 08:02.911
Sergeant Gerry Boyle,
the last of the independents.

08:03.040 --> 08:08.956
The murder in Lettermore.
The one with… occult overtones.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.957
Occult overtones, yeah.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.668
Do you know what I mean
when I say “occult”?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.638
Aleister Crowley.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.514
Anton LaVey.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.400
–Simon Magus, that kind of thing.
–Well done.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.313
Round of applause.
Red roses for the blue meanie.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.756
Anyways, it was Billy Devaney
did for him.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.152
He's into all that black magic.
That's “magik” with a K.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.951
Yeah, he told me last night
when he was locked.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.496
Little Billy Devaney
wouldn't hurt a fly.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.240
He didn't hurt a fly.
He put a bullet in your man's brain.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.159
Good point. Could I have your name?

08:44.200 --> 08:47.078
Yeah, Bozo the fucking clown!

08:48.760 --> 08:54.232
Bozo… the… fucking… clown.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.957
I didn't know the circus was in town.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.676
Little Billy Devaney a serial killer?

09:05.520 --> 09:07.954
Sure, he's a lovely little lad.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.790
Fuckin' Andy Murray.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.135
You won't be playing tennis again
for a long time, boy.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.594
I was playing squash.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.554
No squash courts where you're
headed, Ted Bundy of the West.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.437
–Now…
–What are you, Italian?

09:28.560 --> 09:32.599
No, I am not fuckin' Italian! Why does
everybody keep saying that?

09:32.720 --> 09:35.080
–Cos you look Italian.
–I fuckin' don't.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.430
Yes, you do.
Doesn't he look Italian?

09:37.560 --> 09:40.160
You've been cautioned
under the Bestiality Act.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.111
Man, that was fuckin' years ago.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.560
I thought that had been
forgotten about.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.636
Same thing happened to Polanski.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.115
What was it?
A sheep or something?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.800
It was a llama.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.360
I didn't know it was illegal
to interfere with a llama. Did you?

09:55.400 --> 09:59.632
I would have assumed so, Billy.
I mean, what would its parents think?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.915
William Montmorency Devaney,

10:03.040 --> 10:07.397
where were you at approximately nine
in the pm last night? Thereabouts.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.160
I was approximately in Hanley's
battering Joey Brennan about the head

10:11.200 --> 10:13.309
until he lapsed into unconsciousness.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.997
Why were you bat…?

10:24.800 --> 10:29.078
–Why were you battering him?
–I was provoked, like.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.395
Look, we're having a few jars, right,

10:31.520 --> 10:34.680
when he brings up yet a-fucking-gain
this 200 euros I owe him.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.160
He's had me computer
that I lent him for a year.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.560
I says, “Give me my fuckin' computer,
I'll give you your euros.”

10:40.600 --> 10:42.716
Then suddenly, right out of nowhere,

10:42.840 --> 10:45.000
he rears up at me
screaming for his money.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.960
I grab hold of the nearest thing
that came into me hands.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.520
This antique blunderbuss
me granddaddy got me…

10:50.560 --> 10:52.676
Antique what?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.552
Blunderbuss.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.560
I was, er, showing it off, like,
and then the next thing you know,

11:10.600 --> 11:13.480
I was battering him around
the fuckin' head with it.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.751
I mean, that is vicious, like, I'll admit.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.996
What are you talking about?

11:19.120 --> 11:23.671
You shot him in the head. You stuffed
pages from the Bible into his mouth.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.160
You put a pot plant on his body
and painted “5½” on the wall.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.000
Sweet Jesus on a stick,
you have me under false pretences.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.040
Now, look, I thought this was
about Joey Brennan. Huh?

11:33.080 --> 11:36.834
–What the fuck?
–The murder in the holiday home.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.952
Jesus, lads, this was about 9:00pm,
wasn't it?

11:40.080 --> 11:43.520
Aren't I telling ye I was in Hanley's?
I have about 20 witnesses.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.320
Joey Brennan was fuckin' alive when
I left him, so you can't get me on that!

11:47.360 --> 11:50.432
Wasn't he roaring at me
with his fuckin' broken lip?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.800
You said he lapsed
into unconsciousness.

11:52.840 --> 11:57.197
Yes, he lapsed into unconsciousness
and after that he fuckin' woke up.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.749
–And that's the whole story?
–That is the whole story.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.592
–Has he made a complaint?
–No, he hasn't.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.000
He's made a fuckin' nuisance call,
it looks like.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.970
Haul in this Joey Brennan,
see what he has to say.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.010
See if we can charge him
with wasting police time.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.200
Then get round
to this gobshite's house,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.280
and charge his grandda
with illegal possession of a firearm.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.436
–No, come on.
–I'm on it, Sarge.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.398
(Door closes)

12:29.520 --> 12:33.718
“I'm on it, Sarge.”
He thinks he's in fuckin' Detroit.

12:39.120 --> 12:44.752
So, your mother…
Six to eight weeks is the prognosis.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.714
–That's what they told me.
–That is how long she has, then.

12:48.840 --> 12:52.389
–She looks fine. Healthy.
–(Doctor) Hmm.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.398
It's not what is on the outside
that counts,

12:55.520 --> 12:59.593
it's what is on the inside…
eating away at you.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.578
I just want her to be comfortable.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.036
That's all.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.871
(She chuckles)

13:30.520 --> 13:32.590
–What are you reading?
–Oh.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.391
Never got into the Russians.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.517
They take too long
getting to the feckin' point.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.471
Not even Dostoyevsky, no?

13:42.600 --> 13:45.751
Come on, he was the main offender.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.756
Gogol was good.

13:51.920 --> 13:56.038
He went doolally in the end, though.
God love him.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.595
How are you settling in?

14:00.720 --> 14:02.915
Oh, all right, I suppose.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.759
(Sighs)

14:12.840 --> 14:14.831
They're all so fuckin' boring.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.798
Who?

14:17.920 --> 14:19.751
The inmates.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.598
Including me.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.063
I suppose they've a right
to be gloomy.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.831
There's no need to make such
a fuckin' song and dance about it!

14:30.800 --> 14:33.712
–(Chuckles)
–(Gerry slaps her leg)

14:38.000 --> 14:40.560
–(Game) <i>You're gonna die, copper.</i>
–(Shoots)

14:41.800 --> 14:43.597
(Squeal of tyres on game)

14:45.440 --> 14:47.920
–<i>Come on, copper.</i>
–Little early for a drink.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.077
–(Shoots)
–You're still on duty.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.751
–You've been gone all afternoon.
–<i>Flesh wound. Flesh wound.</i>

14:55.880 --> 14:58.400
Are you going to make
declarative statements

14:58.440 --> 15:00.192
or fuckin' tell me something?

15:00.320 --> 15:01.799
(Shooting)

15:01.920 --> 15:04.960
The murder over in Lettermore,
the victim's a John Doe.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.831
He's a John Doe, is he?

15:06.960 --> 15:09.880
–Yeah. It means…
–I know what it fuckin' means. Go on.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.592
–(Shoots)
–<i>Good shot!</i>

15:11.720 --> 15:15.918
The name and address he gave
are false. We sent off his prints.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.794
Anything else?
You're boring the hole off me.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.631
You got a call from Galway.

15:23.760 --> 15:28.286
You're to head in tonight to attend
a briefing from a fella over from the FBI.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.238
Special Agent Wendell Everett.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.632
So what?

15:33.760 --> 15:35.591
Maybe it's about the murder.

15:35.720 --> 15:40.191
Maybe he's got a psychological profile
on the killer or something.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.197
It's drug smuggling.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.136
Or they've had another sighting
of Whitey Bulger

15:45.200 --> 15:47.031
at some fuckin' museum.

15:47.160 --> 15:51.358
Yeah, well, drug smuggling…
I mean, that's pretty exciting.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.634
Yeah, it's fuckin' exciting.

15:54.760 --> 15:57.760
If you think standing
on the fuckin' pier at Rossaveal

15:57.800 --> 16:00.598
in the pouring fuckin' rain
for hours on end

16:00.720 --> 16:02.711
waiting on a fuckin' ship

16:02.840 --> 16:05.840
that's never gonna fuckin' arrive
is fuckin' exciting.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.632
Now go get me a pint.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.318
(Tirade of shots)

16:09.440 --> 16:13.228
(Game) <i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Good shot. Oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

16:17.560 --> 16:20.360
(American man) The vessel
we are looking for is a 60-foot ship

16:20.400 --> 16:22.356
called the “Annabel Lee”.

16:22.480 --> 16:26.080
We lost it three weeks ago
when it left the Dominican Republic.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.317
The DEA believe it to have
somewhere in the vicinity

16:29.440 --> 16:32.318
of $500 million worth
of cocaine on board.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.273
–It may well…
–Er, that's half a billion, lads.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.236
Half a billion.

16:41.680 --> 16:45.798
Er, thank you, Inspector Stanton.
Yes, that's half a billion.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.477
Slide.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.480
The men we believe to be involved
in the trafficking

16:52.520 --> 16:55.353
are Francis Sheehy-Skeffington
out of Dublin.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.995
Next.
Liam O'Leary also out of Dublin.

16:59.720 --> 17:03.315
Next.
Clive Cornell out of London.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.195
Next. And James McCormick
out of Limerick.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.153
Now, these men
are highly dangerous and if…

17:12.599 --> 17:15.353
And if you do make a si…

17:16.560 --> 17:18.198
Yes, Sergeant?

17:18.319 --> 17:20.959
I thought only black lads
were drug dealers.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.999
I'm sorry, what?

17:30.120 --> 17:33.120
I thought only black lads
were drug dealers. And Mexicans.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.957
They have a word for them.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.119
There's a word for you too, sir,
but I'm not gonna go into that now.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.560
Anyway, as I was saying, these men
are highly dangerous. And if…

17:43.600 --> 17:45.431
Mules! Drug mules!

17:47.040 --> 17:50.160
That's enough of your guff, Boyle.
Apologise to the man.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.838
Huh? Apologise for what?

17:51.960 --> 17:55.517
–Er, you know for what.
–For your racist slurs for one thing.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.245
I'm Irish, sure.
Racism's part of my culture.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.191
Enough. You're showing us up.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.851
–Fucking knacker.
–Fuck off back to Dublin.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.280
–I'll rip your fuckin' head off, Boyle!
–Relax.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.639
Sit down!

18:08.200 --> 18:11.510
Now, now, lads, come on,
not in front of the American.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.927
–He's just messing, Agent Everett.
–Deliberately disrupting my lecture.

18:16.960 --> 18:21.272
Ah, I'm only having a bit of fun, like.
Don't mean anything by it.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.840
Half a billion dollars' worth of cocaine
is a subject for levity?

18:24.880 --> 18:27.792
–Street value.
–Excuse me?

18:27.920 --> 18:30.880
Street value. You always announce
a seizure of drugs

18:30.920 --> 18:33.240
worth a street value
of ten million dollars

18:33.280 --> 18:36.590
or 20 million dollars
or half a billion dollars.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.960
I do wonder what street it is
you're buying your cocaine on,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.320
because it's not the same street
as I'm buying my cocaine on.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.840
That's enough. We've had enough
of your wisecracks for one day.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.920
If you continue on in this vein, you can
consider yourself under suspension.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.793
–Oh, I doubt that.
–You doubt that?

18:53.920 --> 18:56.960
You got balls talking
to your superior officer like that.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.254
If we were in Atlanta…

18:58.280 --> 19:01.033
–We're not, though.
–If we were in Atlanta…

19:01.160 --> 19:03.520
–Galway.
-…you'd be ticketing jaywalkers.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.915
–Galway!
–That's it. Consider yourself…

19:06.040 --> 19:08.240
You're not hunting four men,
only three.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.748
–How's that?
–McCormick is dead.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.600
–What makes you think that?
–Well, I hope he's dead.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.456
They've put him into
the fuckin' morgue anyways.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.235
(Sniffs)

19:47.160 --> 19:49.799
–Schopenhauer.
–I'd say Nietzsche.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.760
Nietzsche! You haven't fucking
read any Nietzsche.

19:52.800 --> 19:57.237
–I have, too. Erm, “The Antichrist”.
–Quote me something, then.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.031
–“What does not kill me…”
–Fuck's sake. Every child knows that.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.864
–(London accent) Bertrand Russell.
–Bertrand Russell. Are you listening?

20:06.920 --> 20:09.560
Fuckin' English.
Everything has to be fuckin' English.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.752
Name your favourite philosopher,
lo and behold, he's fuckin' English.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.029
–He's Welsh.
–Huh?

20:15.160 --> 20:17.390
Bertrand Russell was Welsh.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.595
–Bertrand Russell was Welsh?
–Yeah.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.076
You know, I never knew that.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.873
Didn't think anybody interesting
was Welsh.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.434
–Dylan Thomas.
–Like I said.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.788
Ah. “You will not get the crowd
to cry hosanna

20:34.920 --> 20:38.833
“until you ride into town on an ass.”
Nietzsche.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.776
–Yeah, that's a good one.
–Good quote. Nice one.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.955
–Oh, fuck it.
–(Siren wailing)

20:47.080 --> 20:48.479
The guards.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.074
–We weren't speeding.
–I know.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.829
–One of the back lights out there?
–No, you're fine there.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.758
Well, what did you
fuckin' stop us for, then?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.598
Excuse me?

21:39.720 --> 21:44.510
What did you fucking stop us for, then,
you stupid fucking cunt?

21:44.640 --> 21:46.119
(Sniggers)

21:49.240 --> 21:51.231
Get out, the lot of you.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.990
–Nice friend you got.
–These English, what can you do?

21:59.120 --> 22:01.350
–IDs, please.
–From Dublin, are you?

22:01.480 --> 22:04.353
–IDs, please.
–Your name? I know a lot of guards.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.920
–You know a lot of guards?
–He's a very friendly fella.

22:06.960 --> 22:11.033
–No harm in it. What's the name?
–Get this over with, for fuck's sake.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.356
–What's the name?
–McBride.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.278
McBride.
We know all about you, McBride.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.843
–Do we know about McBride, Liam?
–(O'Leary) We do, Francis.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.240
Should we be using our real names,
though?

22:26.280 --> 22:28.880
–What does it matter now, Liam?
–You're right.

22:28.920 --> 22:32.629
–We know all about you, McBride.
–You know nothing about me.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.355
–Stop, McBride. It's no use.
–Stop, McBride!

22:38.000 --> 22:41.629
Turn around, now, there's a good lad.

22:41.760 --> 22:46.151
Nah. I'll take it as it comes,
if it's all the same to you.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.381
–Show you up for the cowards you are.
–Suit yourself!

22:52.800 --> 22:56.000
–He took that very well.
–He was very philosophical about it.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.758
(Both chuckle)

22:57.880 --> 23:00.758
–Are we going now?
–We have to dump the body.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.880
–I don't do manual labour.
–Come on.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.480
No. When I applied for the post
of international drug trafficker,

23:06.520 --> 23:10.134
it said nothing about “must have
experience of heavy lifting”.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.598
(Gerry) Into the west.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.030
Been to Ireland before, Wendell?

23:29.160 --> 23:31.037
Can't say that I have, no.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.549
Where are you from, originally?

23:33.680 --> 23:36.069
Originally, Wisconsin.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.839
Oh. Whereabouts in Wisconsin?

23:38.960 --> 23:40.359
Kenosha.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.994
Kenosha, Wisconsin.

23:43.120 --> 23:46.112
So how would you wind up
in Tennessee?

23:46.240 --> 23:48.629
How did you know
I was in Tennessee?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.600
Wasn't that where you were stationed

23:50.640 --> 23:53.600
when you caught Tyrell Lee Dobbs,
the Knoxville Ripper?

23:53.640 --> 23:55.756
You been doing your research on me?

23:55.880 --> 23:59.509
Ah, I'm sure you did the same
with me.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.598
Sorry, I didn't really have the time.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.137
Ah, sure, you're a busy man,
I know that.

24:06.520 --> 24:11.036
–D'you know where I'd like to go?
–No. Where would you like to go?

24:11.160 --> 24:14.277
–Tupelo. Birthplace of the King.
–Mississippi.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.277
My wife's from Jackson.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.942
–How long have you been married?
–Eight years.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.151
–Any kids?
–Two boys.

24:24.280 --> 24:29.070
Stokely's five years old.
Huey just turned three months old.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.073
–I got a picture of him.
–I don't want to see it.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.235
Excuse me?

24:34.360 --> 24:37.716
I don't want to see it.
Babies all look the same.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.480
The only time a baby doesn't look like
every other baby

24:41.520 --> 24:43.280
is when it's a really ugly baby.

24:43.320 --> 24:47.393
So, unless it's a photo of a really
ugly baby, I don't want to see it.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.399
–Well, that's pretty fuckin' rude.
–Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.351
Oh, it is.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.153
I'd like to have a family someday.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.840
Too busy whoring around
and getting fucked up now.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.440
I don't think
you should be telling me this stuff.

25:01.480 --> 25:06.235
You know, I've been reading…
where they're smuggling the cocaine

25:06.360 --> 25:08.280
out of Colombia in little submarines.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.794
Submarines they've built themselves,
like.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.469
Yeah, sounds insane, but it is true.
You are correct.

25:15.120 --> 25:18.954
Crafty little beggars.
You have to admire their enterprise.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.719
–No, Sergeant. You don't.
–You do.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.349
You ever been to the States?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.277
Yeah, once. Disney World.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.360
What, when you were a kid
with your family?

25:33.400 --> 25:35.834
No, this was last year.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.434
–You went with a girlfriend?
–No, God, no.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.917
You went to Disney World
by yourself?

25:44.040 --> 25:46.031
Yeah. Great gas it was.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.596
Had me picture taken with Goofy.
He's my favourite, Goofy.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.120
I can't tell if you're really
motherfucking dumb

25:57.160 --> 25:59.116
or really motherfucking smart.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.240
(TV) <i>Put your fingers to your ears
when you want me to stop!</i>

26:11.280 --> 26:13.271
(Long drawn-out scream)

26:26.240 --> 26:28.037
(Knock at door)

26:34.880 --> 26:36.154
(TV off)

26:37.480 --> 26:39.516
(European accent)
Sergeant Boyle?

26:39.640 --> 26:42.342
There's been a mix-up.
You've the wrong night.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.233
I'm sorry?

26:44.360 --> 26:48.069
–You're from the agency?
–No. My husband is missing.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.475
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Come in, come in.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.632
I'll just slip into something
a little less comfortable.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.597
(Gerry) Nice mug of tea.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.520
Now…

27:12.040 --> 27:14.520
So your husband is missing,
you were saying?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.676
–I didn't get your name.
–Gabriela.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.872
Gerry. So?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.798
My husband is missing, yeah.
I think so, yes.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.357
–Name?
–Aidan McBride.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.836
Aidan McBride.
Not the guard, Aidan McBride?

27:28.960 --> 27:31.679
Yes. He started working here today.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.438
–How long has he been missing?
–Since tonight.

27:35.560 --> 27:39.269
That's no time at all, sure.
He might be on the tear somewhere.

27:39.400 --> 27:43.439
–He does not drink.
–He doesn't drink?

27:43.560 --> 27:46.920
He called me at eight o'clock.
He said he was on his way home.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.520
I've tried his cellphone, but it's dead.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.120
Ah, there's been no accidents
on the road as far as I know.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.041
I'm only after getting in meself.

27:56.120 --> 27:59.635
–Would it be to do with your work?
–Ah, no.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.672
Do you mean, has he gone
undercover with the Mob?

28:02.800 --> 28:07.920
Ah, no. You'd have to head down
to Limerick for that sort of excitement.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.111
–How long have you been married?
–Three years.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.755
–Where are you from? Romania?
–Croatia.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.838
Ah, Croatia.
Good footballers, the Croatians.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.428
They used to be, anyway.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.433
Listen, I'm sure
there's an innocent explanation.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.080
If you still haven't heard anything
by tomorrow evening,

28:31.120 --> 28:35.591
that'll be 24 hours, and I can put out
a county-wide alarm.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.360
What did they used to call
those things? On the telly?

28:39.400 --> 28:42.756
–I'm sorry?
–APB.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.440
“I'm putting out an APB.”

28:45.560 --> 28:48.074
You never hear that any more, do ye?

28:49.760 --> 28:52.149
–Thank you again.
–Good luck.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.112
I'll see ya.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.791
Bit chilly out, huh?

30:16.200 --> 30:19.556
Looked pretty impressive out there,
Sergeant.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.830
I was fourth in the Olympics.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.190
(Chuckles) Bullshit.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.991
Yeah, Seoul '88. Lovely people,
the South Koreans. Lovely food.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.113
Bullshit.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.674
No, 1500-metres freestyle.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.880
I thought I was odds on
for the bronze.

30:34.920 --> 30:38.390
The two Germans I was prepared for,
but fuckin' Salnikov.

30:38.520 --> 30:42.200
Supposed to be over the hill. Russians
never know when they're beaten.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.560
“The Monster in the Waves”,
they called him.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.556
You were fourth in the Olympics?

30:46.680 --> 30:50.639
You don't get anything for fourth.
It's a cruel world.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.272
So, Kenosha, Wisconsin,
you were saying.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.831
Did you grow up in the Projects?

30:59.880 --> 31:02.240
–What?
–Did you grow up in the Projects?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.440
Or do they not have Projects
in Kenosha?

31:04.480 --> 31:07.552
No, I did not grow up in the Projects.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.320
It might surprise you to learn,
Sergeant Boyle,

31:10.360 --> 31:12.720
that I come from
a very privileged background.

31:12.760 --> 31:15.519
And by “privileged”,
I mean prep schools, Yale.

31:15.640 --> 31:19.560
I was a Rhodes Scholar. Bet you don't
even know what a Rhodes Scholar is.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.440
–I do know what a Rhodes Scholar is.
–Enlighten me.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.038
Kris Kristofferson.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.878
Yeah, Kris Kristofferson
was a Rhodes Scholar.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.797
You are correct.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.272
Privileged background, huh?

31:38.400 --> 31:42.029
Summer in the Hamptons,
skiing in Aspen. That kind of thing.

31:42.160 --> 31:46.358
Skiing, yeah?
I thought black people couldn't ski.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.671
Or is that swimming?

31:53.880 --> 31:56.189
Ho. Ho.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.680
So what do you have planned
for your day?

32:01.720 --> 32:06.271
Well, we obviously don't know
who killed McCormick or why.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.440
There was no useful forensic
evidence at the crime scene,

32:09.480 --> 32:12.440
so I thought we might start
by canvassing the neighbourhood

32:12.480 --> 32:15.520
where the body was discovered,
see if anybody heard something.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.680
We also must consider the fact
that McCormick was probably

32:18.720 --> 32:21.712
reconnoitring drop-off points
all along the coast.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.229
–Sergeant.
–What?

32:26.400 --> 32:28.470
Sorry, you lost me at “we”.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.558
We. You and I.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.913
It's my day off. Did I not tell ya?

32:36.040 --> 32:37.917
It's your day off?

32:38.640 --> 32:41.480
I've had it booked for a good while.
You can ask Stanton.

32:41.520 --> 32:45.533
We're investigating a murder,
trafficking of half a million dollars'…

32:45.600 --> 32:46.749
Billion.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.297
Half a billion dollars' worth
of cocaine,

32:49.320 --> 32:51.240
and you're telling me it's your day off?

32:51.280 --> 32:54.670
I'm sure 24 hours
won't make any difference.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.275
24 hours won't make any difference?

32:57.280 --> 33:01.200
They say it does on these cop shows,
but it doesn't. Not in my experience.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.835
Ah, why do you keep repeating
everything I say?

33:19.760 --> 33:22.115
(Knock on door)

33:23.520 --> 33:27.280
How are you? Special Agent Everett,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

33:27.320 --> 33:29.144
Could I ask you a few questions?

33:34.160 --> 33:37.630
Oh, you don't… You don't speak
any English, huh?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.275
And you don't speak any English?

33:48.080 --> 33:50.000
I just wanna show you a few pictures,

33:50.040 --> 33:55.797
see if you've seen any of these men
in the last few days. This gentleman?

34:12.159 --> 34:14.639
I'm sorry.
Is there anyone else here that I…?

34:14.679 --> 34:17.560
So where are you taking us
to have your wicked way?

34:17.600 --> 34:20.034
–I've a room booked at the G.
–Oh, fancy.

34:20.159 --> 34:23.947
–No expense spared.
–Are we not too official for the G?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.790
Whether you are or you aren't,

34:25.800 --> 34:29.159
they'll have Sergeant Gerry Boyle
to deal with if they don't like it.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.078
–He's power mad.
–They say power corrupts.

34:32.199 --> 34:35.909
And I'm corrupted absolutely.
You'll find that out soon enough.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.597
(Muttering profanities)

34:50.239 --> 34:53.038
–Are you the FBI man?
–Yes, I am.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.675
–Behavioural Science Unit?
–Er, no.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.110
Actually I'm investigating
the smuggling of narcotics.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.071
Ah, drugs.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.232
(Dog barks)

35:08.160 --> 35:10.280
(Gerry) Hurry up, Aoife.
I'm tumescent.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.680
You're not in bad shape
for an auld lad.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.792
–(Gerry) So me mother's telling me.
–Sergeant!

35:15.920 --> 35:18.920
(Aoife) You're not that old, Sergeant.
Don't listen to her.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.680
Ah, I'm old enough to be your father.

35:20.720 --> 35:24.720
You think about that while you're
fucking us, if that's what turns you on.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.116
Oh, Sinead, you're one sick puppy.
I think I'm in love.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.958
(Sinead giggles)

35:30.080 --> 35:32.000
–(Phone clicks)
–What's the craic?

35:32.040 --> 35:35.874
–Just a little memento. Looky.
–You can put it in your archive.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.118
–I know what I'd put in your archive.
–The man's obsessed.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.434
Ha, Wonderbra.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.240
Now it can be revealed.
I have very small breasts.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.389
That's OK. I have a very small penis.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.596
Sergeant!

35:48.720 --> 35:50.790
How you doing, sir?

35:51.840 --> 35:54.479
Special Agent Wendell Everett of…

35:54.600 --> 35:55.953
Sir?

35:57.840 --> 35:59.034
Sir?

35:59.160 --> 36:00.957
(Clicks tongue)

36:01.080 --> 36:02.752
Seen this guy?

36:04.720 --> 36:06.517
What about this one?

36:07.160 --> 36:09.799
No? You don't speak English
either, huh?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.352
(Clicks tongue)

36:16.240 --> 36:17.593
(Sighs)

36:19.200 --> 36:21.111
(Sighs) This is the life.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.960
Are we to assume
you're satisfied with the service?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.992
I'm totally drained, sure.
I've no jism left.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.720
Be giving us a good review
at the agency now.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.910
Oh, five stars.

36:32.040 --> 36:35.600
–Only wish I'd brought me handcuffs.
–There's always next time.

36:35.640 --> 36:39.474
–You'd be into a bit of bondage?
–Only for you, Sergeant.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.397
Only for you.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.311
(Gerry whistles)

37:16.480 --> 37:18.675
Ah, for fuck's sake.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.158
I do not understand.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.720
Just because his car is here,
why does it mean he killed himself?

37:29.760 --> 37:31.637
It's a suicide hot spot.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.400
A lot of the locals have
drowned themselves here.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.671
That's why we have to put up
with these prima donnas.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.519
I do not think
Aidan committed suicide.

37:41.400 --> 37:45.712
Neither do I, to be honest with ye.
Didn't seem intelligent enough.

37:45.840 --> 37:50.391
Course, if it's not suicide,
then it's foul play.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.918
Foul play?

37:54.040 --> 37:56.235
Murder. Malice aforethought.

37:58.120 --> 38:02.040
But I cannot think who would have
wanted to do something bad to Aidan.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.071
He's a guard.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.431
Somebody somewhere probably
had a grudge against him.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.262
It's a better theory than suicide,
in my view.

38:13.600 --> 38:17.784
Is there anything you can tell me
that might have a bearing on all this?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.871
–Anything personal?
–He's gay.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.956
He's gay. You know,
when one man puts his…

38:27.080 --> 38:29.719
I'm familiar with
the mechanics of it, yeah.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.477
I just didn't realise.

38:35.560 --> 38:39.917
Do you think he met someone there
who would do something bad to him?

38:40.040 --> 38:43.476
Like, you know, what do you say?

38:46.760 --> 38:49.832
–Like a rent boy or something?
–Yeah, a rent boy.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.520
No, there's not much call for rent boys
around here, as far as I know.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.391
Maybe in town.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.672
Why'd you marry him?

39:03.800 --> 39:05.791
For the visa, I suppose?

39:07.320 --> 39:09.311
It's just between you and me.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.715
Yes. I get a visa and he looks…

39:15.760 --> 39:18.558
–Respectable.
–Yes, respectable.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.799
Wendell.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.309
Hmm, nice outfit.
Do you juggle as well?

39:42.440 --> 39:44.590
Fuck you, Sergeant.

39:46.640 --> 39:50.368
Hot whiskey, John-Joe, please.
And a cold one while I'm waiting.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.756
–Yourself?
–Er, Guinness.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.836
Two Guinnesses as well, John-Joe.

39:54.960 --> 39:59.087
Like the fat man said, if you have
to be careful not to drink too much,

39:59.160 --> 40:03.358
it's because you're not to be trusted
when you do. Any luck?

40:03.480 --> 40:07.268
Not a damn thing.
Man, these people out here are…

40:07.400 --> 40:10.710
–I know. It's like Compton, huh?
–Exactly.

40:10.840 --> 40:14.625
They're not too keen on talking
to the law, that's for damn sure.

40:14.720 --> 40:18.679
–Most don't even speak English.
–They speak English well enough.

40:18.800 --> 40:22.360
This is a Gaelic-speaking region.
Did they not teach you that at Langley?

40:22.400 --> 40:26.109
No, they did not teach me that
at Langley.

40:26.240 --> 40:30.870
For the simple fact that Langley's
the CIA, you idiot, not the FBI.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.516
You didn't know people in the west of
Ireland speak Gaelic and I'm the idiot?

40:35.640 --> 40:37.039
Whatever.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.755
–How was your day off?
–Energetic.

40:43.880 --> 40:46.640
Something's come up.
I'm not talking about my cock.

40:46.680 --> 40:49.877
One of my men's gone missing.
McBride.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.880
I spotted his car in a known suicide
spot. He was on duty at the time.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.679
–Any sign of foul play?
–Not as far as we know.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.240
But you don't think it's suicide.
What, then?

40:59.280 --> 41:02.477
First McCormick gets murdered,
now a guard disappears.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.397
It's too much of a coincidence.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.960
Could be he stumbled
onto something and got…?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.309
–Whacked?
–Whacked, yeah.

41:10.640 --> 41:14.368
His first day on the job in Connemara,
too. Talk about bad luck.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.231
Yeah. But, er, where do we start?

41:20.760 --> 41:24.317
I say we start with these two lads
and we take it from there.

41:24.320 --> 41:25.320
<i>Slàinte</i>.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.280
That's Gaelic.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.997
(♪ Man singing folk song)

41:42.480 --> 41:44.646
What's the first case you ever solved?

41:48.880 --> 41:51.952
–Stealing an ostrich.
–What?

41:54.040 --> 41:57.312
Guy stole an ostrich,
transported it across state lines.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.159
Had something to do with the eggs
or something.

42:00.240 --> 42:04.139
It's more original than dealing crack,
anyway. You ever have crack?

42:05.720 --> 42:08.837
–Do you think I'd tell you if I had?
–I've had it.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.640
Yet again, I don't think you should be
telling me these kinds of things.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.840
They say if you have one hit
you're hooked, but that's shite.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.438
It's propaganda for kids.

42:18.560 --> 42:22.360
You certainly are an unconventional
police officer, Sergeant Boyle.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.472
–Thank you.
–That was not meant as a compliment.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.319
Ah, now, you're only messing,
I know that.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.759
What's so fascinating?

42:38.800 --> 42:40.631
(Gerry) Hmm.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.957
I had what I thought was a crank call

42:44.080 --> 42:46.760
saying the person responsible
for McCormick's death

42:46.800 --> 42:48.677
was this lad Billy Devaney.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.199
Oh.

42:50.320 --> 42:53.756
–Which one's Devaney? The Italian?
–Yeah.

42:53.880 --> 42:56.920
Devaney's alibi is that
he was in Hanley's on the night

42:56.960 --> 42:58.632
battering Joey Brennan there.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.797
–So?
–So I was thinking…

43:03.520 --> 43:08.389
Maybe whoever made the crank call
was there on the night, saw Billy…

43:08.520 --> 43:11.478
Saw Billy Devaney assaulting Brennan

43:11.600 --> 43:14.876
and decided to throw him in the frame
for McCormick too.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.677
Exactly.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.352
(Wendell laughs)

43:21.480 --> 43:25.640
Jesus, he gave him a hell of a clout.
Christ, he's strong for a little lad.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.830
(Wendell) Whoa. Freeze it, freeze it.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.399
–No, no, go back.
–Fuck.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.919
Give it…

43:37.360 --> 43:40.352
Goddamn, that's Sheehy and Cornell.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.277
Look at it. They're here.

44:07.240 --> 44:11.074
Like a donkey fucking
a hippopotamus, it's party time.

44:12.720 --> 44:13.869
What?

44:14.000 --> 44:18.152
Like a donkey fucking
a hippopotamus, it's party time.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.551
–What the fuck are you on about?
–Sheehy said…

44:24.720 --> 44:27.109
He was taking the piss,
for fuck's sake.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.554
That's nice. Is that real leather?

44:32.480 --> 44:34.471
Why, what am I, fucking cheap?

44:36.600 --> 44:38.397
It's all there, yeah?

44:39.880 --> 44:43.350
–Excuse me?
–It's all there?

44:43.480 --> 44:46.240
No, it's not. I've skimmed
a couple of grand off the top.

44:46.280 --> 44:49.113
–What?
–Course it's fucking all there.

44:49.240 --> 44:53.028
This is the pay-off, yeah?
We pay you off,

44:53.160 --> 44:56.789
you and your pals keep your
fucking noses out of our business.

44:56.920 --> 44:59.480
That's the dynamic of this situation.

45:00.200 --> 45:04.239
Why the fuck would I then cheat you
out your money? Eh?

45:04.360 --> 45:07.397
Why would I do that?
That doesn't make any sense.

45:07.520 --> 45:11.877
That'd defeat the entire purpose
of the fucking interaction. Fuck me!

45:17.480 --> 45:20.524
Somebody got out of bed
the wrong side this morning.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.755
Fuckin' Brits.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.510
The big city boys.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.400
(Wendell)
But these are the three main ports?

45:36.440 --> 45:38.510
Barna, Spiddal, Rossaveal.

45:38.640 --> 45:41.040
OK, let's get three teams
in each of those places.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.720
And I wanna move up and down
the coast, point by point.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.910
Big map. People pointing.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.837
Must be important.

45:52.880 --> 45:56.000
I wanna move the teams up and down
the coast, point by point.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.750
We'll do it in about 48 hours.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.557
All happening now, huh?

46:00.680 --> 46:02.352
Excuse me a moment.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.070
Sorry, I didn't mean to insult…

46:07.200 --> 46:09.880
Don't you ever fuckin' grab me
like that again.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.400
Don't you ever speak to me
like that again.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.040
You have your fuckin' zombies
around you now.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.960
Mobile phones, computers.
Very fuckin' sophisticated.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.440
We're working on a vitally important
case. What I need from you…

46:21.480 --> 46:25.553
What do you need from me, Wendell,
apart from a cup of fuckin' coffee?

46:25.680 --> 46:28.353
Boyle, some mad lad
wants to talk to ya.

46:28.480 --> 46:32.109
His cat's probably stuck up a tree
or something.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.996
You should probably take that.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.981
(Wendell) So, logistically,
what we're gonna need is…

47:09.360 --> 47:11.430
–Where is it?
–Beyond.

47:12.680 --> 47:15.911
They didn't hide it very well. Sloppy.

47:17.240 --> 47:20.312
Well, they were probably out here
after dark.

47:20.440 --> 47:22.874
Be a lonely old job up here at night.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.232
Yeah, probably ghosts up here
and everything. Poltergeists.

47:28.200 --> 47:31.880
I don't know about the poltergeists.
There's nothing to peg around.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.514
–What were you doing up here?
–Heroin.

47:35.960 --> 47:39.080
You'll get a belt, Eugene,
if you carry on with that craic.

47:39.120 --> 47:40.951
Give us a hand here.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.327
–What?
–You've taken something.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.320
–I have not.
–You've taken something.

47:57.360 --> 47:59.078
You didn't even act surprised.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.680
This is like the Birmingham Six
all over again!

48:01.720 --> 48:04.560
Hand it over, you little shit.
Don't make me frisk ya.

48:04.600 --> 48:07.920
You're trippin', nigga! If you frisk me,
I'll have you up on charges!

48:07.960 --> 48:09.920
You want me to batter the hell
out of you?

48:09.960 --> 48:12.030
Cos I will, boy. No questions asked.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.476
What in hell are you doing?

48:23.440 --> 48:25.317
–It's tiny.
–It's a Derringer.

48:25.440 --> 48:29.319
John Wilkes Booth used one
to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.476
Wouldn't think it'd do much damage.

48:31.600 --> 48:35.673
They get the job done. But I can't see
what use they'd be to the 'RA.

48:35.800 --> 48:38.712
Maybe they're for killing
little Protestants.

48:38.840 --> 48:41.274
Killing little Protestants.
That's funny.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.446
(Cornell) I fucking hate bent coppers.

48:45.480 --> 48:49.678
–Did they try something?
–No, they didn't try something.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.519
What's the problem, then?

48:52.640 --> 48:56.400
(Cornell) I'm fucking tired of the kind
of people we have to deal with.

48:56.440 --> 48:59.238
What d'ye expect?
We're drug traffickers.

49:01.160 --> 49:04.948
Dalai Lama's hardly gonna be
looking for a piece of the action.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.191
It's dispiriting, though, innit?

49:11.120 --> 49:13.031
What's the point?

49:13.920 --> 49:16.229
It's all so fucking meaningless.

49:16.360 --> 49:18.794
–The money?
–The money, yeah.

49:19.560 --> 49:21.800
How much money do you need
to be happy?

49:21.840 --> 49:24.752
–The whores?
–The whores, yeah.

49:27.040 --> 49:31.000
I'm at that stage where I'm looking
for a more meaningful relationship.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.349
I'm with you there.

49:34.360 --> 49:35.873
Monogamous.

49:37.160 --> 49:39.913
There's one guard
Stanton couldn't vouch for.

49:40.040 --> 49:41.792
Says he's too unpredictable.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.798
Don't tell me. Let me guess. Boyle.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.151
Yeah, that's him.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.711
I like sharks.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.951
They're soothing.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.193
(Panting)

50:13.800 --> 50:15.631
He was no use.

50:17.320 --> 50:20.080
Sure, what have you got to confess,
at your age?

50:20.120 --> 50:22.998
What's my age got to do with it?

50:23.120 --> 50:25.594
Sure, Pol Pot was in his 70s
when he died.

50:25.720 --> 50:28.600
I think Pol Pot's shenanigans
were a little more malicious

50:28.640 --> 50:30.749
than anything you might've got up to.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.796
Shows what you know.

50:32.920 --> 50:36.080
Really? You took part in a sex orgy
or something, did ya?

50:36.120 --> 50:38.839
–One of them bacchanals?
–(Chuckles) Get away.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.918
–Or bust a cap in the ass of a homey?
–(Laughs)

50:45.720 --> 50:48.757
So how are things
in the world of law enforcement?

50:48.880 --> 50:53.715
–We've had a lad over from the FBI.
–Oh. The Behavioural Science Unit?

50:53.840 --> 50:55.956
Drugs.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.911
–Ah, sure.
–Yeah.

51:01.080 --> 51:03.674
–What kind of drugs?
–Cocaine.

51:03.800 --> 51:07.110
Cocaine?
I could do with some cocaine.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.714
They say it gives you
great get-up-and-go.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.487
Oh, it perks you up, all right.

51:11.560 --> 51:15.040
Helps you get off with the lasses, too.
They're mad for the stuff.

51:15.080 --> 51:17.799
–Who could blame them?
–True enough.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.115
–What about amyl nitrate?
–What?

51:20.240 --> 51:24.836
–What does amyl nitrate do for you?
–Am I a fucking drugs aficionado?

51:24.960 --> 51:27.554
What's with the sudden interest?

51:27.680 --> 51:31.275
I don't know.
I… I feel I've missed out.

51:32.160 --> 51:35.640
–You missed out on amyl nitrate?
–Well, generally, I'm saying.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.399
Ah, sure, we all fucking
missed out generally.

51:38.520 --> 51:40.829
You're not alone there.

51:42.560 --> 51:46.838
What's going on in that tiny little
brain of yours? Come on, tell me.

51:51.640 --> 51:58.034
I was just thinking I haven't…
listened to music in a long time.

51:58.160 --> 52:01.197
Live music, you know?
Like a ceilidh band.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.920
If that's all,
I can sort something out for tonight.

52:04.960 --> 52:08.157
–You will?
–Bound to be something good on.

52:10.040 --> 52:12.514
It's not as if
you're that hard to please.

52:13.520 --> 52:16.222
Yeah, that's what they said to me
at the orgy.

52:19.800 --> 52:21.472
(♪ Pop music on radio)

52:30.440 --> 52:33.193
–You've been in the wars, huh?
–Yeah.

52:33.320 --> 52:36.437
–Who did that to ya?
–Just a fella.

52:36.560 --> 52:39.233
Just a fella. Not a very nice fella.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.076
There are no nice fellas.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.731
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that, now.

52:47.280 --> 52:50.556
That's a very pessimistic world-view.

52:53.880 --> 52:56.468
Two more of them, please, Yuyang.
Chocolate.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.960
What brings you back to Galway,
Aoife? Nothing good, I'm betting.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.070
It's about those pictures.

53:04.120 --> 53:06.160
–What pictures?
–The ones from the G.

53:06.200 --> 53:10.113
(♪ BOBBIE GENTRY:
“Ode to Billy Joe”)

53:10.240 --> 53:11.355
What about them?

53:13.320 --> 53:18.314
I'm to tell you to keep your head down,
if you know what's good for you.

53:18.440 --> 53:21.028
And if I don't keep me head down,
what then?

53:27.720 --> 53:29.472
Are we making any headway?

53:32.680 --> 53:35.911
–Sheehy.
–Sergeant Boyle.

53:36.840 --> 53:39.149
So it was a set-up from the start?

53:39.280 --> 53:42.040
–How'd you work that?
–No, it was just a random thing.

53:42.080 --> 53:45.200
Heard there was a guard in Galway
with a penchant for whores.

53:45.240 --> 53:50.155
Decided to take advantage of it.
Totally opportunistic on my part.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.510
This song really freaks me out, man.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.400
What did they throw off
the fucking Tallahatchie Bridge?

53:55.440 --> 53:58.989
–I always thought it was a baby.
–(Sheehy) Yeah?

53:59.120 --> 54:01.800
Could be a gun.
Well, could be any fuckin' thing.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.798
Bobbie Gentry said
she didn't know what it was.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.744
Supposed to be mysterious, like.

54:06.800 --> 54:08.711
It gives me the fuckin' creeps.

54:08.840 --> 54:11.880
You know what gives me the creeps?
Cunts who beat up women.

54:11.920 --> 54:15.913
Ah, that wasn't me, now. It was one
of me overenthusiastic minions.

54:16.040 --> 54:19.426
–Cornell or O'Leary?
–You're very well informed, Sergeant.

54:19.440 --> 54:23.149
–I keep abreast of current events.
–(Sheehy) Good man yourself.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.760
No, I'm not a fan of violence
against women

54:25.800 --> 54:28.598
and I'm not a fan of blackmail either.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.188
So, er, as an added incentive…

54:32.440 --> 54:35.159
–Now…
–What's the point in paying me off?

54:35.280 --> 54:38.160
You'll have to pay off
every other guard on the west coast.

54:38.200 --> 54:39.997
(Chuckles)

54:42.840 --> 54:45.991
–The lot of them?
–Enough as makes no odds.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.680
–Even Wendell?
–Who's… Oh, the Yank?

54:48.800 --> 54:52.240
No, I decided that discretion
was the better part of valour there.

54:52.280 --> 54:56.558
You know what the Americans are like
with their fuckin' ideals.

54:57.440 --> 55:01.399
I'll say this now, so as we're clear.
This is a one-time-only offer.

55:01.520 --> 55:06.071
Cross me on this and you're finished.
And this is not just about me.

55:06.200 --> 55:09.880
You can't just arrest me and it's over.
There are men behind the men.

55:09.920 --> 55:12.673
(Slurps noisily)

55:21.280 --> 55:23.510
Do you understand?

55:24.960 --> 55:27.110
I understand, Sheehy.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.439
I understand.

55:31.680 --> 55:32.954
Good.

55:35.440 --> 55:37.590
Goodbye, amigos.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.796
Are you all right?

55:42.920 --> 55:46.280
That milkshake's after giving me
a fuckin' milkshake headache.

55:46.320 --> 55:48.515
Oh, I hate them.

55:51.600 --> 55:56.833
–What are you gonna do?
–I'll be all right. It'll go in a minute.

55:56.960 --> 56:02.432
♪ And drop them into the muddy
water off the Tallahatchie Bridge ♪

56:05.560 --> 56:09.348
You know when you about someone
being liquidated by the Mob?

56:09.480 --> 56:12.677
–Hmm.
–What does that actually mean?

56:13.440 --> 56:16.680
Means they've been killed.
I mean, what else would it mean?

56:16.720 --> 56:21.555
I know that. But does it mean they've
actually been turned into liquid?

56:23.600 --> 56:25.352
Turned into liquid.

56:29.320 --> 56:33.632
No. Just… killed.

56:34.800 --> 56:38.320
Suppose turning someone into liquid
would be too time-consuming, huh?

56:38.360 --> 56:40.078
Take ages.

56:44.840 --> 56:47.308
Ah. Mrs McBride.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.635
–You've found him?
–No, I'm sorry.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.160
We just wanted to ask you
a few more questions.

56:52.200 --> 56:55.112
–Please.
–I thought Sergeant Boyle was…

56:55.240 --> 56:57.714
–He's been relieved of those duties.
–Why?

56:57.720 --> 57:01.320
–There was a jurisdictional issue.
–He's not right in the head.

57:01.360 --> 57:05.544
I don't think we need to involve
Mrs McBride in that discussion, do you?

57:05.600 --> 57:08.068
Right you are.
You know more than me.

57:09.200 --> 57:13.557
I'm sorry. We were wondering if there
was any reason you could think of

57:13.680 --> 57:16.553
that your husband might have
chosen to disappear.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.996
–No. I told Sergeant Boyle all I know.
–No, I understand.

57:20.120 --> 57:23.795
–Was he on the take?
–I… I don't understand…

57:23.920 --> 57:26.840
McBride. Was he taking money
from people? Gangsters?

57:26.880 --> 57:28.960
–Whoa!
–He is a good man. Why would he…?

57:29.000 --> 57:32.200
–No, no. Of course he's a good man.
–Ah, sure, we're all good men.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.800
The fact remains,
he shows up in the west

57:34.920 --> 57:37.600
at the exact same time
a bunch of drug smugglers

57:37.640 --> 57:40.400
are landing half a billion dollars'
worth of cocaine

57:40.440 --> 57:42.396
and then he suddenly goes missing?

57:42.520 --> 57:45.120
–Hmm, sounds fishy to me.
–Inspector Stanton!

57:45.160 --> 57:47.976
–You're saying he is a criminal?
–No, we're not…

57:48.040 --> 57:50.440
Many a blind eye be turned
for that money.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.280
–He is from Dublin after all.
–Oh!

57:52.320 --> 57:55.320
I thought you wanted to find
my husband, but you insult him?

57:55.360 --> 57:59.240
Mrs McBride, I would like to sincerely
apologise for the insensitivity…

57:59.280 --> 58:03.160
I will only speak to Sergeant Boyle.
Please do not come to my work again.

58:03.200 --> 58:04.762
–Mrs Mc…
–Good day to you.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.677
Mrs McBride, if I could…

58:08.800 --> 58:11.519
Hmm! Touchy, huh?

58:11.640 --> 58:13.870
They're like that, the Romanians.

58:18.560 --> 58:20.437
(Car horn beeps)

58:32.440 --> 58:34.237
–Sergeant.
–Colum.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.032
D'you want one of these?

58:39.160 --> 58:41.196
–What are they?
–I dunno.

58:41.320 --> 58:44.520
Libyan lad gave them to me.
All different colours, look.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.676
I'll pass, Colum.

58:47.360 --> 58:50.909
I'll have one of the purple ones.
They make you feel frisky.

58:52.240 --> 58:55.170
Right. We'll have a little look-see
for ourselves.

58:57.680 --> 59:00.672
–Who found 'em?
–Young lad.

59:02.280 --> 59:06.034
–We won't have any trouble there?
–No, he's a good lad.

59:06.160 --> 59:10.116
He's a bit cracked, anyways, so, like,
even if he did say something…

59:10.160 --> 59:14.676
–Is that the lot, yeah?
–Yeah. What's the problem?

59:14.800 --> 59:17.560
There's supposed to be
two of those Kalashnikovs

59:17.600 --> 59:19.556
and two Glocks, and a Derringer.

59:19.680 --> 59:22.478
–What's a Derringer?
–It's like a baby gun.

59:22.600 --> 59:28.232
One of the gay lads used to like
secreting it on his person, you know.

59:28.360 --> 59:32.319
–There were gay lads in the IRA?
–There are one or two, like.

59:32.440 --> 59:35.997
It was the only way we could
successfully infiltrate the MI5.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.593
What?

59:41.720 --> 59:44.000
I mean, an AK-47,
a Glock and a Derringer.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.921
That's a lot to go missing, like.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.120
Have you any idea
what happened to them?

59:50.720 --> 59:53.996
–Maybe the mice ate them.
–Huh?

59:54.120 --> 59:56.111
Maybe the mice ate them.

59:56.240 --> 59:59.760
I can't be after putting that in
me report. “Maybe the mice ate them.”

59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.473
–No?
–Not really, no.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.184
Why don't you put in your report

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.840
that Sergeant Boyle
went out of his fuckin' way

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:11.722
to do you boys a fuckin' favour,
and he got really fuckin' annoyed

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:16.191
when you started asking him stupid
questions about missing fuckin' guns,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.400
and trying to fuckin' catch him out
as if he was some fuckin' gobshite?

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.280
–No need for that.
–You have your explosives, don't ya?

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.280
It's not as if you lads were ever keen
on getting in close for a scrap, now.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.920
Blowing up Australians by mistake
from a distance

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.030
was more your modus operandi.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.311
There's no need for that.
I'm after upsetting you.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.432
I apologise.
Now can we leave it at that?

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.314
I accept your apology, Colum.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.115
You boys owe me one, though.
For going out of me way.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.913
I'll have to put it
to the high command.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.396
–Is there still a high command?
–There is, yeah.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.717
Well, I can't ask fairer than that.

–What?

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.194
(Sheehy) I don't know.
That's an anomaly.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.520
Is that the right word?
I don't think it is.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.630
(O'Leary) Why? The guard, I mean.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.720
(Sheehy) The blackmail didn't bother
him and he didn't take the money.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.150
–I'm impressed.
–I was, too, I have to say.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.157
Yeah, good luck to him.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.751
It's not often you come across
that kind of integrity in our business.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.314
–Still…
–Yeah, we can't have that.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.120
We'll have to make sure
he's out of harm's way.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.914
–Why's it always me, though?
–Cos you're a psychopath.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.760
I'm a sociopath, not a psychopath.
They explained that to me in Mountjoy.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.476

–Dunno. It's a tricky one.

Sure, what could he say?

He won't be happy.
Me out gallivanting.

Always a good boy.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.712
Oh, stop it.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.469
No, you never gave me
a moment's grief.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.876
Ah, now stop. Now we both know
that's not true.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.916
We checked the dispensary.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.192
There was nothing missing,

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.634
(Gerry) She probably
saved 'em up herself.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.433
She was always crafty like that.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.518
She did not leave a note.

(Gerry) She didn't have
to leave a note.

What needed to be said?

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.591
She was a proud woman.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.111
She was a brave woman.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.591
She was my mother.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.719
Thank you.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.189

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.313
You know,
I lost my father a few years ago.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.591
Didn't really hit me at the time.
It was only later that I…

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.712
It's tough, all right.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.279
Yeah.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.191
Yeah, it is.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.397

–Cornell, Sheehy and O'Leary.

–Where's this intelligence from?
–Garda sources.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.111
–Garda sources?
–Yeah.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.400
The Naval Service
will stand down here.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.600
We'll concentrate the operation
in Cork.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.030
–So you're moving on?
–Yeah.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.880
There's another agent
in place down there already.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.751

for this monstrosity right here.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.278
–That's for you.
–What?

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.760
Come on, you can't shoot
a Kalashnikov in the middle of Ireland.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.840
Be an international fucking incident.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.678
You have to. I'll need covering fire.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.677
Covering fire for what?

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.310
I'm going to arrest those lads

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.240
for the murders of James McCormick
and Aidan McBride

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.033
and on the lesser charge
of smuggling cocaine.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.463
–Yes, Wendell?
–Point I'd like to make.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.358
It's fucking suicide.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:19.838
I know. Even if I get away with it,
the big boys'll be after me.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.678
I'll have no fuckin' peace.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.000
It's all right for you. You can go
to the States. Where can I go?

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.654
That's the trouble with the Irish,
Wendell. They never forget.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.422
But I'm still going to go down there,
anyways.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.029
Now, I know what you're thinking.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.147
You're thinking, those men
are armed and dangerous.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.519
You being an FBI agent,

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.680
you're more used to shooting
at unarmed women and children.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.711
Fuck you, Sergeant!

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.311
Are you gonna help me or not?

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.074
–Have you ever been shot before?
–Yeah.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.676
Does it hurt?

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.553
Does it hu…?
No, it doesn't hurt! It's kind…

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.080
Yeah, it hurts!
What the fuck do you think?

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.839
You got any more ammo
for this thing or what?

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.320
They say that the shock
counteracts the pain.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.880
–Who are “they”?
–I don't know. I'm just saying.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.070
It hurts, all right?

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.191
It fuckin' hurts like hell, man.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.550
–Oh, shit.
–That's right.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.234
Right.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.440
How many times have you been shot?

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.597
–Three times.
–Three times? Jesus.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.593
You must be getting used to it
by now, then, huh?

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.359
–Anybody you want me to call if you…
–Nah. I don't have anybody.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:51.760
Just pin a medal to me body, like
those lads coming home from Iraq.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.471
–Fuck you again, Sergeant.
–Thanks for coming to help, Wendell.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.277
I appreciate it.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.916
(Wendell) See ya.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:35.715
–Oh, you gotta be fucking joking.
–It's the guard!

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.990
I'm here for Sheehy and Cornell!

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.708
The rest of you can go,
if you've a mind to!

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.712
I'll take that as a no.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.995
Let's get the fuck out of here, Clive!

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.746
Are you kidding me? This is better
than fuckin' Christmas!

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.193
What?

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.315
Come on, move it out!

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.559
Ah, fuck.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.074
Good shot.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.553
Flesh wound.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.316
Wait, wait, I give up! Me hole!

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.675
–Aargh!
–Oh!

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.879
Boyle!

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.038
Boyle!

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.756
(Glass smashes)

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.558
(Groans)

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.473
(Groans)

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.559
Lucky shot.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.150
Ah, now, don't be a sore loser.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.240
Although it's not every day
you lose half a billion dollars.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.032
Two hundred million it was.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.440
They're always fuckin' overestimating.
Didn't I fuckin' know well?

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:32.234
You don't know anything
about anything, you stupid little man.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.828
Ah, I think I did all right for meself.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.997
I did for you,
Francis Sheehy-Skeffington.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.678
And your pals.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.240
Who was up there
firing that fuckin' cannon?

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.430
The FBI lad.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.630
Probably hasn't had this much fun
since they burnt those kids at Waco.

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.992
–Fuckin' O'Leary.
–He wasn't the sharpest all right.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.080
And the Englishman
wasn't much better.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.997
Colombians are more reliable.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.712
(Explosion)

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.151
(Creaking)

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.600
I'm not gonna beg you to help me,
if that's what you want.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.437
I know how to die.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.552
Good for you, Sheehy.

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.477
Good for you. I'll see ya.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.712
Boyle!

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.879
Boyle!

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.991
Boyle!

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.072
Boyle!

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.957
Fuck.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.830
–You from the press?
–Oh, God, no.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.399
–Asshole.
–That's a good one now.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.238
Moody.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.834
You can use it
for the cover of your book.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.239
What book?

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.319
You yokes are always writing books
about your fuckin' experiences.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.200
Probably sell it to the movies, then.
A fish-out-of-water story, huh?

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.760
Lots of action, bit of humour.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.040
Throw in some young ones getting
their kit off and you're well away.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.839
–Need a happy ending to sell it.
–Happy ending?

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:19.280
Didn't you foil a multimillion-dollar
drug-trafficking operation

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.447
and knock off a trio of drug barons
to boot? What's unhappy about that?

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.991
–Lost a good man.
–I wouldn't be sure about that, now.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.366
They never recovered a body,
did they?

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.031
It's a big sea out there.

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:40.399
He's dead.
Either burned up or drowned.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.630
But he was a really good swimmer.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.032
I'm sorry, son, that was just bullshit.
He was never in the Olympics.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.517
Well, maybe so. Sure,
it's easy enough to look up, anyways.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.316
(Wendell) You know, I can't tell
if you're really motherfucking dumb

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.197
or really motherfucking smart.
