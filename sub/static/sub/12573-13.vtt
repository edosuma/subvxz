00:14.798 --> 00:17.598
[magical incantation]

00:20.109 --> 00:21.409
[howling noise]

00:21.473 --> 00:25.095
That spell, it's awakening the
dark spirits that guard this place.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.931
It's a wolf.

00:31.401 --> 00:35.262
The wizard who sold me this scroll swore
it was a spell of opening, not awakening.

00:35.312 --> 00:36.832
Then the evil spirits were already awake.

00:36.967 --> 00:38.799
Stop thinking about spirits.

00:40.579 --> 00:42.508
Let's think about the treasure that's inside.

00:43.136 --> 00:46.233
Old idols with emeralds and ruby eyes.

00:46.403 --> 00:49.726
Scabbed and encrusted with moon diamonds.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.308
[thunder]

00:54.666 --> 00:56.494
Open it then.
Hurry.

00:59.162 --> 01:00.962
[magical incantation]

01:34.880 --> 01:36.196
Follow me.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.336
Don't be a fool.

01:45.936 --> 01:47.244
It's not real.

01:52.948 --> 01:55.129
Let's get those statues.

02:11.378 --> 02:13.178
[wind howling]

02:26.354 --> 02:27.657
Hold the door!

02:28.279 --> 02:30.349
Ignaz, hold!

02:32.341 --> 02:35.044
Ignaz!
Open that door!

02:38.745 --> 02:39.957
Who are you?

02:40.643 --> 02:42.243
[screaming]

02:43.043 --> 02:45.633
Legend of the Seeker S01E13
"Revenant"

02:46.275 --> 02:47.575
subtitle by rogard

02:50.151 --> 02:51.551
[horse neighing]

02:57.536 --> 02:59.821
RICHARD: The Seeker's last battle had been won.

03:00.474 --> 03:02.323
But the Seeker was mortally wounded.

03:02.913 --> 03:05.174
The Confessor knew that she too was dying,

03:05.828 --> 03:07.573
but she had no thought for herself,

03:08.228 --> 03:09.673
only for him.

03:16.909 --> 03:18.001
Kieran.

03:18.496 --> 03:20.113
My quest is finished.

03:21.527 --> 03:23.417
And now, Vivian,

03:26.667 --> 03:28.657
I am dying.

03:30.128 --> 03:34.180
We die together,
as it should be.

03:41.850 --> 03:45.943
RICHARD: Their deaths were witnessed
only by the Great Wizard Anfortas.

03:47.926 --> 03:51.203
He picked up the sword,
knowing he must keep it hidden

03:52.238 --> 03:54.173
until the rise of a new Seeker,

03:54.793 --> 03:59.258
who might also be asked
to die for a glorious cause.

04:02.539 --> 04:05.424
It's too bad they couldn't have lived
to see the world they've saved.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.822
But they died, knowing
they'd fulfilled their destiny.

04:14.998 --> 04:16.212
And...

04:18.690 --> 04:20.509
at least they died together.

04:21.538 --> 04:23.744
ZEDD: Soon we'll arrive at the crypt of Tavarang,

04:23.794 --> 04:26.139
and you'll see wher the ancient Seeker lies buried.

04:26.640 --> 04:31.454
And there, we'll hide the Box of Orden,
where Darken Rahl will never find it.

04:32.217 --> 04:34.101
Are you sure the Box of Orden
will be safe there?

04:34.226 --> 04:36.284
The outer door is sealed by magic.

04:37.145 --> 04:40.728
And I have the only key to
the crypt where Kieran lies.

04:40.932 --> 04:45.932
It's fitting that he will for one last time
help protect the world against evil.

04:54.201 --> 04:55.376
Richard?

04:55.736 --> 04:57.201
What is it?

05:00.358 --> 05:01.698
I was thinking.

05:03.195 --> 05:05.792
My quest will end
with the death of Darken Rahl.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.028
Are you worried you won't succeed?

05:10.556 --> 05:12.074
No, it's not that.

05:12.623 --> 05:13.824
Then what?

05:15.764 --> 05:17.855
The prophecy says I will defeat Rahl.

05:19.739 --> 05:21.539
It doesn't say what will happen to us.

05:31.988 --> 05:34.088
[magical incantaion]

05:59.004 --> 06:00.376
This way.

06:05.485 --> 06:08.162
Here, look.
There's the story from the book.

06:26.765 --> 06:28.713
There's the Sword of Truth.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.644
It's hard to believe this is the same sword.

06:33.389 --> 06:35.187
It's more than just a story.

06:42.496 --> 06:43.460
This is it.

06:44.798 --> 06:46.791
The inner crypt where Kieran lies.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.742
[magical incantation]

07:14.674 --> 07:16.327
RICHARD: I would've liked to have known him.

07:19.434 --> 07:20.702
ZEDD: Ancient Seeker,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.934
you once defeated those who
would enslave the Midlands.

07:24.222 --> 07:26.528
We ask you to keep this box safe

07:26.701 --> 07:28.569
and aid us once again.

07:29.154 --> 07:30.728
Take the box, Richard.

07:31.193 --> 07:32.636
Place it inside with Kieran.

07:44.144 --> 07:45.496
Where is the remains?

07:46.280 --> 07:48.886
RICHARD: There's nothing here.
No bones, no burial cloth.

07:48.898 --> 07:50.329
ZEDD: I don't understand.

07:50.805 --> 07:54.921
This key has been held only by wizards
since the day Kieran was buried.

07:58.041 --> 07:59.841
Something's not right.

08:05.050 --> 08:07.139
Zedd? The door.

08:21.555 --> 08:23.046
It sealed itself.

08:25.294 --> 08:27.194
[magical incantation]

08:39.164 --> 08:42.409
We must've sprung some sort of
magical trap when we opened the sarcophagus.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.871
We need to find another way out.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.635
Wandering around blindly
we'll get into even worse trouble.

08:50.258 --> 08:53.096
Worse than being trapped alive
in an ancient tomb?

08:53.602 --> 08:54.902
[distant knocking]

08:55.478 --> 08:56.622
What was that?

09:00.776 --> 09:02.731
Maybe this wasn't
some magical trap.

09:04.289 --> 09:06.095
Maybe we're not alone in here.

09:25.486 --> 09:27.116
[sobbing noise from a woman]

09:27.166 --> 09:28.643
Someone's crying.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.288
ZEDD: Richard, be careful.

09:30.747 --> 09:31.795
Who's there?

09:33.216 --> 09:35.116
[crunching and cracking noise from below]

09:42.247 --> 09:45.389
Apparently it's not as hard to
get in as it is to get out.

09:46.473 --> 09:47.967
[distant sobbing continues]

09:48.017 --> 09:49.072
Stop!

09:50.055 --> 09:51.247
Richard!

09:58.256 --> 09:59.576
[echoing] KAHLAN: Richard?

09:59.611 --> 10:01.097
Where are you?

10:02.679 --> 10:04.140
Kahlan, wait!

10:05.736 --> 10:08.399
KAHLAN: Stay where you are.
Wait for me.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.561
[sobbing, gasping]

10:26.259 --> 10:27.292
Kahlan?

10:27.780 --> 10:29.785
Richard.
I'm right here.

10:31.722 --> 10:33.193
Then who was I following?

10:34.415 --> 10:35.915
[sobbing continues]

10:39.343 --> 10:40.519
Who are you?

10:41.631 --> 10:42.819
What do you want?

10:48.544 --> 10:50.348
Don't follow her.

10:53.307 --> 10:54.792
RICHARD: She's crying.

10:55.892 --> 10:57.437
She needs help.

11:03.969 --> 11:05.434
How did she--?

11:05.536 --> 11:07.414
She is not of our realm, Richard.

11:08.548 --> 11:10.175
She's a spirit.

11:11.055 --> 11:13.858
I thought that spirits were supposed
to spend eternity in the underworld.

11:13.997 --> 11:16.302
Most spirits are
content in the underworld,

11:17.247 --> 11:19.637
reunited with the people
that they loved in life.

11:20.404 --> 11:23.611
But sometimes they have
unfinished business.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.917
She was wearing a confessor's dress.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.962
Maybe she was Vivian's spirit.

11:30.124 --> 11:33.542
Vivian helped Kieran complete his quest.
She died with him.

11:34.217 --> 11:36.936
What unfinished business
would she have?

11:38.285 --> 11:40.147
Maybe she's trying to tell us.

11:48.121 --> 11:49.624
There's a door here.

11:49.764 --> 11:51.230
Maybe she was trying
to show us a way out?

11:51.280 --> 11:52.525
Can you open it?

11:55.291 --> 11:57.261
[magical incantation]

11:58.287 --> 12:00.146
MAN: Stop!
Don't open it!

12:02.478 --> 12:03.910
Stay back!

12:09.465 --> 12:10.835
You don't know what you're doing!

12:11.198 --> 12:12.963
The door must not be opened!

12:17.472 --> 12:18.972
No!

12:26.760 --> 12:28.056
Who are you?

12:28.300 --> 12:29.858
Why did you attack us?

12:30.151 --> 12:32.025
I came to steal treasure.

12:32.384 --> 12:35.137
I didn't believe the tales of evil spirits.

12:36.068 --> 12:38.251
But then I found myself possessed by one.

12:39.023 --> 12:40.234
That light that left you?

12:40.269 --> 12:44.078
It was the spirit who has owned me
for five long years.

12:46.596 --> 12:50.152
It forced me to attack you
to keep you from opening that door.

12:50.217 --> 12:51.382
Why?

12:53.234 --> 12:55.375
This place is
full of great evil.

12:56.266 --> 12:57.479
Get out.

12:57.565 --> 12:59.821
Get out while you still can.

13:08.272 --> 13:10.226
We are dealing with
more than one spirit.

13:10.514 --> 13:14.153
One of them led us to this door and the other
tried to kill us to keep us from opening it.

13:15.363 --> 13:16.698
It could be a way out.

13:17.451 --> 13:19.266
Restless spirits
are unpredictable.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.776
I've heard stories of
the spirits of mothers

13:21.811 --> 13:24.406
mourning for their children,
leading them to their deaths.

13:24.572 --> 13:26.224
But Vivian was a confessor.

13:26.552 --> 13:28.807
Even as a spirit she'd
never harm the Seeker.

13:28.992 --> 13:30.822
We should open the door.

13:31.918 --> 13:32.953
I don't know.

13:33.222 --> 13:35.130
What choice do we have?
There is no other way out.

13:42.548 --> 13:44.348
[magical incantation]

14:29.428 --> 14:31.124
It's an ancient language.

14:31.551 --> 14:33.943
The same as the
Book of Counted Shadows.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.459
It says:

14:38.612 --> 14:41.601
"Here lies Kieran, the True Seeker."

14:42.333 --> 14:44.695
Why would his body be
hidden away in a plain casket

14:44.730 --> 14:46.983
when a secret crypt
was built just for him?

14:47.018 --> 14:49.237
We don't know for certain
that his body is even in there.

14:49.740 --> 14:51.081
Let's find out.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.422
Richard, don't.

14:53.552 --> 14:55.184
You don't know what's in there.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.236
RICHARD: Someone's cut off his head.

15:09.349 --> 15:10.516
Why?

15:10.725 --> 15:12.621
This is a wizard's spell.

15:13.756 --> 15:15.814
These magical bindings
keep the spirit

15:15.849 --> 15:18.486
from moving to it's final
resting place in the underworld.

15:18.521 --> 15:21.366
So he's never been reunited with
his family, his loved ones?

15:22.313 --> 15:24.372
That must be why Vivian walks here.

15:24.666 --> 15:26.208
That's why she was crying.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.106
Because the Seeker is trapped here.

15:28.651 --> 15:29.911
She can't be with him.

15:30.081 --> 15:33.484
And she's been waiting for a thousand years
to be reunited with him.

15:33.905 --> 15:37.338
We might wait for her for the next
thousand years if we don't find a way out.

15:38.823 --> 15:40.436
I think this is our way out.

15:42.929 --> 15:46.112
Maybe Vivian trapped us here because
she wanted us to help Kieran.

15:46.411 --> 15:50.003
And maybe, once Kieran's free,
she'll free us too.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.938
Undoing another wizard's
magic is a violation.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.959
So is beheading a Seeker.

15:56.906 --> 15:59.861
Kieran gave up everything for his quest.

15:59.896 --> 16:02.122
His spirit should be with
his father, his mother,

16:02.170 --> 16:03.634
his confessor.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.774
People he loved.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.479
Not trapped here alone in the dark.

16:09.894 --> 16:13.167
I agree, it's terrible, but wizards
don't do things like this lightly.

16:14.150 --> 16:16.170
Who knows what will happen
if we unbind him?

16:16.576 --> 16:19.995
We can't leave him like this,
alone.

16:22.071 --> 16:23.851
Think of everything he sacrificed.

16:29.757 --> 16:32.614
I sincerely hope I don't
end up regretting this.

16:33.985 --> 16:36.587
ZEDD: As I destroy these bindings,

16:36.967 --> 16:39.748
so shall this spirit be free.

16:41.511 --> 16:45.307
As this cloth is consumed by flame,

16:47.892 --> 16:51.837
so shall the bindings release.

16:55.555 --> 16:57.355
[crumbling sound]

17:18.265 --> 17:19.398
Richard!

17:22.366 --> 17:23.652
Can you hear me, boy?

17:29.696 --> 17:30.962
I'm fine.

17:40.478 --> 17:42.272
Are you sure you're not hurt?

17:44.937 --> 17:47.332
ZEDD: Now let's see if that door is open.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.493
Not yet.

17:49.547 --> 17:52.011
Kieran's spirit is free,
but his body is still hidden,

17:52.310 --> 17:53.542
like something shameful.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.406
We need to return him to the crypt.

17:58.787 --> 17:59.987
[Zedd groans]

18:02.371 --> 18:06.063
KAHLAN: When the road you walk is dark,
may you always see the light ahead.

18:06.805 --> 18:10.850
May you always remember
that you do not walk alone.

18:16.575 --> 18:18.566
ZEDD: Now that Kieran is laid to rest,

18:19.095 --> 18:22.334
let us hope our task here is done.

18:22.691 --> 18:23.931
Lead the way.

18:29.805 --> 18:31.405
[threatening music...]

18:33.382 --> 18:34.927
Richard, what are you doing?

18:37.601 --> 18:38.613
Richard!

18:40.988 --> 18:42.531
It's not Richard anymore.

18:44.219 --> 18:45.423
It's Kieran.

18:48.618 --> 18:49.831
Fight this, Richard.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.434
Fight this spirit that possesses you.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.107
He can't hear you anymore.

18:58.596 --> 19:01.725
Richard freed your spirit,
and this is how you repay him?

19:02.511 --> 19:07.282
I'm taking back what that wizard Anfortas
stole from me a thousand years ago.

19:09.006 --> 19:10.366
What are you talking about?

19:13.978 --> 19:15.612
He didn't understand the bond

19:17.078 --> 19:20.286
between Confessor and Seeker.

19:24.765 --> 19:26.498
And he betrayed me.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.671
ANFORTAS: Kieran, Vivian must leave us.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.113
Why?

19:31.134 --> 19:32.608
There is too much between you.

19:32.857 --> 19:34.506
I see it in oyur eyes.

19:35.327 --> 19:37.961
- You love her.
- We've done nothing wrong.

19:38.283 --> 19:39.424
Yet.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.809
I have watched the
two of you growing closer.

19:42.095 --> 19:44.123
Vivian has become a distraction,

19:44.630 --> 19:46.461
and that's putting your quest in jeopardy.

19:48.768 --> 19:51.611
I swear I will
remain true to my quest,

19:52.047 --> 19:54.957
but you must swear
you won't send her away.

19:57.611 --> 19:58.755
Swear it.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.415
I swear.

20:05.013 --> 20:08.158
But Enfortas lied to me.

20:10.115 --> 20:11.518
Just as you lied to him.

20:13.362 --> 20:17.295
I'm a confessor.
I can see that you loved Vivian.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.210
What if I did?

20:19.819 --> 20:24.529
My feelings for Vivian
weren't keeping me from my quest.

20:26.787 --> 20:28.607
But Anfortas wouldn't trust me.

20:30.517 --> 20:32.257
Vivian. Vivian!

20:32.518 --> 20:33.514
Wait!

20:35.008 --> 20:35.978
Where are you going?

20:36.149 --> 20:39.770
Anfortas thinks that it's too dangerous
for me to stay at your side.

20:40.787 --> 20:42.004
How could the?

20:42.452 --> 20:44.415
He swore he wouldn't send you away.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.396
He said that you think more of me
than you do of your quest.

20:47.431 --> 20:48.773
Oh Vivian.

20:49.604 --> 20:51.091
We belong to each other.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.826
We never can,
and you know why.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.824
Because your love would enslave me?

20:56.294 --> 20:57.371
Yes.

20:57.766 --> 21:00.173
Vivian, there's no harm
you could do to me.

21:01.803 --> 21:02.992
Kieran.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.321
Vivian.

21:04.993 --> 21:07.295
I will already do
anything that you ask,

21:08.050 --> 21:10.410
because I'm already yours to command.

21:30.377 --> 21:31.799
She gave in to her passion.

21:32.234 --> 21:33.752
And you were confessed.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.524
She violated her
most sacred duty,

21:37.816 --> 21:39.307
to protect the Seeker.

21:41.390 --> 21:42.435
No.

21:43.968 --> 21:46.702
Our love only
strengthened our bond.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.821
But Anfortas thought as you did.

21:50.902 --> 21:52.806
He was determined to destroy us.

21:54.415 --> 21:56.262
What you did was wrong.

21:57.589 --> 21:59.825
What you're doing now is wrong.

22:01.135 --> 22:03.641
You have to release the Seeker.

22:04.263 --> 22:05.600
Release him?

22:07.136 --> 22:08.561
Why would I do that?

22:08.812 --> 22:13.205
What good does it do you to possess
his body when Vivian is only a spirit,

22:13.792 --> 22:16.806
waiting for you to join
her in the underworld?

22:23.709 --> 22:25.113
Stay back!

22:35.507 --> 22:37.584
You won't do anything to hurt me.

22:39.255 --> 22:41.652
You hurt me,
you hurt your Seeker.

22:48.236 --> 22:51.349
I have no intention
to join Vivian in the Underworld.

22:51.384 --> 22:52.767
I have a body now.

23:04.437 --> 23:06.000
And once I finish with this grace,

23:06.421 --> 23:08.302
Vivian will have a body too.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.560
Yours.

23:25.606 --> 23:26.595
Richard!

23:27.539 --> 23:29.059
Kahlan!

23:46.908 --> 23:47.991
Stay back, creature,

23:48.041 --> 23:51.131
or I'll blast you back to whatever
dark hole you came from.

23:52.390 --> 23:57.010
If you do that, you, your Seeker
and your Confessor will be trapped

23:57.147 --> 23:59.534
in this tomb for all eternity.

24:02.359 --> 24:03.645
Who are you?

24:03.982 --> 24:06.383
I am the spirit of Anfortas.

24:08.033 --> 24:09.569
Wizard to Kieran.

24:09.734 --> 24:11.437
Now when your Seeker killed this body,

24:11.784 --> 24:15.609
I've used an ancient spell of
awakening to occupy it once more.

24:16.906 --> 24:19.811
But I only have a thousand
heatbeats before it dies again,

24:20.061 --> 24:21.343
so listen to me.

24:21.406 --> 24:24.359
- Can you open this door?
- Not until you listen to me.

24:25.619 --> 24:28.611
I'm the one that tried to stop
you from unbinding Kieran's body.

24:29.559 --> 24:30.620
Why?

24:31.029 --> 24:34.958
Because the story you know
of Kieran is a lie.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.294
KAHLAN: How did you come to learn this magic?

24:44.159 --> 24:47.204
Maybe you don't know as much
about Seekers as you thought.

24:49.331 --> 24:50.539
ANFORTAS: One thousand years ago,

24:50.589 --> 24:55.419
Kieran and Vivian did the worst thing
a Seeker and a Confessor could do.

24:56.898 --> 25:00.069
- They consummated their love.
- Yes.

25:00.545 --> 25:02.378
And it ruined Kieran.

25:02.808 --> 25:06.496
He let Count Elrond, his greatest foe,
slip through his fingers

25:06.546 --> 25:08.745
because he thought only of protecting Vivian.

25:08.932 --> 25:10.885
I need to protect my Seeker,

25:10.920 --> 25:13.652
my Confessor.
Now open this door!

25:13.687 --> 25:15.095
You must listen to me!

25:16.853 --> 25:18.761
I went to Vivian

25:18.861 --> 25:23.178
and made it clear she had
a terrible decision to make.

25:23.833 --> 25:27.746
He is unsure in battle.
He thinks of nothing but you.

25:28.538 --> 25:30.182
You must release him.

25:33.476 --> 25:35.331
Do you know what you're asking?

25:38.074 --> 25:40.884
There is only one way to
release a confessed man.

25:42.485 --> 25:47.982
The Seeker can not fulfill his destiny
as long as you are alive.

25:57.190 --> 25:59.217
ZEDD: Has she defied you,

26:00.402 --> 26:04.286
the Seeker remained confessed
and failed his quest because of it.

26:04.321 --> 26:05.818
No, wizard.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.156
Vivian knew her duty.

26:11.004 --> 26:11.976
Vivian!

26:13.446 --> 26:14.830
Vivian, where are you?

26:19.079 --> 26:20.210
Vivian.

26:20.676 --> 26:22.658
Vivian, what have you done?

26:26.840 --> 26:28.852
What I had to, Kieran.

26:31.639 --> 26:36.036
I will wait for you in the underworld.

26:36.234 --> 26:37.332
No.

26:37.827 --> 26:38.911
Vivian.

26:40.725 --> 26:42.819
No, Vivian,
you can't leave me.

26:51.782 --> 26:52.868
Kieran.

26:58.037 --> 27:00.336
You have betrayed me, Anfortas.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.991
I will never stop loving Vivian

27:03.414 --> 27:05.056
or hating you!

27:05.354 --> 27:07.878
I've never seen a look
full of such loathing.

27:10.447 --> 27:12.389
But we had a quest to complete.

27:13.416 --> 27:16.304
I thought once Kieran was no
longer under Vivian's control,

27:16.553 --> 27:18.066
his grief would fade,

27:18.273 --> 27:19.846
and he would come back to himself.

27:20.415 --> 27:21.998
But he didn't.

27:22.257 --> 27:24.642
A normal man,
freed from his Confessor,

27:24.692 --> 27:27.084
would return to his former life
as if nothing had happened.

27:27.374 --> 27:31.468
But a Seeker and a Confessor
have a special bond.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.958
It's stronger than even I could fathom.

27:35.438 --> 27:37.891
And even Vivian's dath could break it.

27:38.783 --> 27:41.722
It was as if Kieran's soul
had been torn from him,

27:41.920 --> 27:44.123
leaving nothing but anger and hate.

27:44.943 --> 27:46.089
When he took up the sword again--

27:46.239 --> 27:48.549
The Sword of Truth feeds on rage.

27:50.539 --> 27:52.585
It made his anger grow.

27:53.085 --> 27:54.558
It overtook him.

27:55.473 --> 27:56.964
It drove him mad.

27:57.356 --> 27:58.856
[screaming with rage]

28:02.929 --> 28:04.732
ANFORTAS: These people weren't soldiers.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.271
You have betrayed innocence.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.846
This world has no innocence.

28:10.212 --> 28:12.917
You have betrayed your quest.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.651
You have tarnished the name of Seeker.

28:15.686 --> 28:17.863
And you took everything from me!

28:23.753 --> 28:25.646
Vivian and I won't be kept apart.

28:26.089 --> 28:29.014
Even if you kill me,
you won't stop me.

28:30.856 --> 28:31.986
I must!

28:33.697 --> 28:34.965
I will!

28:44.506 --> 28:46.258
I feared Kieran's vow,

28:47.063 --> 28:49.938
that he wouldn't rest,
even in death.

28:51.040 --> 28:54.984
I realize in my prey
of the spirits of the underworld,

28:55.350 --> 28:57.493
destroying the peace they'd found in life.

28:58.629 --> 29:00.811
So I had to bind his spirit.

29:01.494 --> 29:03.974
If you had allowed his spirit
to reunite with Vivian,

29:04.009 --> 29:06.791
then Kieran would've found peace
and none of this would be happening!

29:07.194 --> 29:08.895
If you hadn't unbound Kieran,

29:09.445 --> 29:12.194
Kieran wouldn't be trying
to reunite with Vivian now...

29:12.397 --> 29:13.717
in the flesh.

29:13.781 --> 29:15.581
[magical incantation]

29:26.662 --> 29:28.462
[magical incantation]

29:40.501 --> 29:41.475
Vivian?

29:45.025 --> 29:45.981
Kieran.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.931
My love.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.124
He's using Kahlan's
body as a vessel.

30:05.666 --> 30:07.521
Richard will be confessed.

30:07.875 --> 30:08.866
Yes.

30:09.138 --> 30:12.526
He'll become a monster,
just like Kieran.

30:12.761 --> 30:16.210
Finally what the wizard
stole from us is ours,

30:16.245 --> 30:17.461
forever.

30:22.812 --> 30:25.127
I have enough power left to cast a spell

30:26.277 --> 30:28.228
that will keep him here in the crypt.

30:28.567 --> 30:29.759
Forever.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.462
You can't do that!

30:32.074 --> 30:35.982
Without the Seeker, Darken Rahl will
conquer the world. Thousands will die.

30:36.017 --> 30:39.856
And how many will die if Kieran's
wrath is unleashed upon the world again?

30:39.891 --> 30:43.941
Then let me into the tomb and I will drive
Kieran's spirit from Richard's body.

30:46.227 --> 30:47.545
And if you cannot?

30:53.985 --> 30:56.148
Are you willing to kill your Seeker?

31:04.519 --> 31:05.530
No.

31:05.913 --> 31:07.099
This is wrong.

31:07.536 --> 31:08.644
We can't do this.

31:10.716 --> 31:15.250
We sacrificed our love.
Once we deserve to be happy together.

31:21.317 --> 31:23.177
You said you would wait for me,
and you did.

31:23.468 --> 31:24.927
We're finally together.

31:25.669 --> 31:27.952
We can't throw this chance away.

31:29.033 --> 31:31.070
Richard is more than just the Seeker to me.

31:31.404 --> 31:32.932
That was Kieran to me.

31:33.406 --> 31:36.475
I loved him,
protected him, taught him.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.839
So I hesitated because I loved him.

31:39.874 --> 31:43.325
That hesitation led not only
to the loss of many innocent lives,

31:43.899 --> 31:46.295
it led to the loss of Kieran's soul too.

31:46.858 --> 31:50.704
You led a wizard to my hiding place
where Anfortas had bound me.

31:51.578 --> 31:54.203
Why would you do that if you
didn't want us to be together?

31:54.641 --> 31:57.268
I only did that
so that he would free your spirit.

31:57.886 --> 32:00.142
So we could be together
in the underworld.

32:01.848 --> 32:03.494
Our love is beyond flesh.

32:04.104 --> 32:07.758
That is a lie that the wizard told us,

32:07.793 --> 32:11.637
so we would be content to live without
something everyone else takes for granted.

32:11.672 --> 32:14.129
But this Confessor,
this Seeker,

32:14.634 --> 32:15.941
they have a destiny too.

32:15.976 --> 32:19.123
A destiny that is destroying them,
just as it did us.

32:21.921 --> 32:24.935
They love each other.
I know you can feel it.

32:27.979 --> 32:31.746
This will be a way for them
to be together too.

32:33.307 --> 32:34.793
Oh, Vivian.

32:36.077 --> 32:39.410
I've wanted to touch you for so long.

32:39.445 --> 32:42.391
And I missed you so much.

32:43.270 --> 32:44.507
This is all that matters.

32:45.970 --> 32:47.951
We're all that matters.

32:51.758 --> 32:54.275
If you tell me you don't love me,
I will release you.

32:57.118 --> 32:58.640
Tell me you don't love me,

32:59.776 --> 33:01.031
that you don't want me.

33:06.380 --> 33:07.958
I can't tell you that.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.337
ANFORTAS: The door to the outside world is open.

34:28.018 --> 34:31.188
If you're unwilling to do your duty,
wizard, then leave.

34:32.871 --> 34:37.426
I will do my duty as First Wizard.
Now let me in!

34:46.279 --> 34:48.079
[magical incantation]

35:34.732 --> 35:36.532
[magical incantation]

35:39.355 --> 35:40.855
You said you could open it.

35:40.949 --> 35:42.528
ANFORTAS: This body is weakening.

35:42.578 --> 35:44.087
I'm not strong enough.

35:45.284 --> 35:48.012
Maybe if you join me.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.091
[magical incantation]

36:07.035 --> 36:08.235
[groans in pain]

36:09.389 --> 36:10.689
Look!

36:12.387 --> 36:13.953
Remember what happened to Kieran.

36:15.635 --> 36:18.273
Death is not the worst fate
that can befall a Seeker.

36:29.519 --> 36:30.557
No!

36:36.468 --> 36:40.446
Stay away, Wizard.
Your Seeker and Confessor are gone.

36:42.352 --> 36:44.098
Kieran, stop!
What are you doing?

36:45.438 --> 36:48.141
This time the story
is gonna end the way it's supposed to.

36:53.357 --> 36:54.880
I won't let you kill him.

36:54.915 --> 36:59.048
Vivian, don't make the Seeker lose everything
for a love that is not even his.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.046
And what about my love for Kieran?

37:01.395 --> 37:04.542
Go back to the underworld
and let Kieran follow you there.

37:04.805 --> 37:09.062
I trusted Anfortas and I waited in
the underworld for a thousand years!

37:09.556 --> 37:11.568
- Alone!
- That won't happen this time.

37:11.603 --> 37:12.601
No.

37:13.001 --> 37:15.195
You'll bind him again
and we'll never be together.

37:15.971 --> 37:19.154
I left him once.
I'll never leave him again.

37:20.574 --> 37:21.653
No!

37:34.245 --> 37:36.007
Anfortas was right about one thing.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.897
A Confessor can be replaced.
A Seeker cannot.

37:40.657 --> 37:41.887
Stop it!
What are you doing?

37:42.065 --> 37:44.130
I will do anything to
protect the Seeker.

37:44.228 --> 37:46.140
Including killing his Confessor!

37:46.739 --> 37:49.472
I will drive Vivian from this body
and I will bind her spirit

37:49.507 --> 37:52.769
so that you'll never be together,
in this world or the next.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.938
Please!

37:54.352 --> 37:58.611
then leave Richard's body and I will allow
Vivian to follow you in the underworld.

37:58.705 --> 37:59.789
Kieran.

38:01.074 --> 38:02.362
Why should I believe you?

38:02.525 --> 38:05.237
Because I do not Anfortas.

38:05.863 --> 38:08.257
I believe a Seeker and a Confessor
belong together, Kieran.

38:09.061 --> 38:12.982
In the Underworld, you and Vivian
can exist in peace.

38:13.612 --> 38:15.102
But you can't be together here.

38:16.385 --> 38:19.753
Your only choice is to trust me, Seeker.

38:29.892 --> 38:35.115
Then this time, Vivian, it is I
who'll be waiting for you in the underworld.

38:57.791 --> 38:58.947
You're free, Vivian.

39:00.069 --> 39:01.321
Go find him.

39:02.934 --> 39:04.179
Thank you, wizard.

39:48.332 --> 39:51.671
Obviously we can't leave the box
in this cursed place.

39:54.149 --> 39:56.901
The Story of Vivian and Kieran,
the one that's in the book...

39:56.936 --> 39:59.188
it's been handed down for a thousand years.

39:59.223 --> 40:00.501
Passed down as truth.

40:00.894 --> 40:02.689
Maybe it was a necessary lie.

40:03.094 --> 40:04.322
People need a heroe.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.735
So the legend can be preserved
no matter what the truth is?

40:07.991 --> 40:10.333
I won't judge Anfortas
for changing the story.

40:10.787 --> 40:13.224
It's a great responsibility
to name a Seeker.

40:13.807 --> 40:16.777
One mistake and send
them spiralling into darkness.

40:18.260 --> 40:20.570
When Kieran possessed me,
I sensed that darkness.

40:22.247 --> 40:23.585
And there was something else.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.296
Something I've never felt before.

40:25.599 --> 40:26.640
A power.

40:27.736 --> 40:28.817
Magical power.

40:28.852 --> 40:31.687
Kieran had magic.
He was strong enough to draw a grace.

40:31.838 --> 40:33.005
How could he do that?

40:45.670 --> 40:46.749
It's Rahl.

40:47.747 --> 40:50.640
- I don't understand.
- It's a tracer cloud.

40:51.528 --> 40:52.866
Powerful magic.

40:53.484 --> 40:54.929
He's tracking us.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.735
I don't think it's us he's focused on.

40:58.335 --> 40:59.939
It's the Box of Orden.

41:00.982 --> 41:03.281
I'll cast a Spell of Obscuring.

41:05.085 --> 41:07.085
[magical incantation]

41:13.268 --> 41:16.563
Following the box won't be
such an easy task for him now.

41:19.535 --> 41:20.761
Where do we take it?

41:21.845 --> 41:24.054
Not we. I.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.395
You can't go off on your own.

41:26.715 --> 41:30.433
I won't allow the box to be the beacon
that leads Rahl to Richard.

41:35.445 --> 41:38.125
I'll rejoin you once I'll hide it.

41:38.175 --> 41:38.627
Where?

41:40.108 --> 41:42.342
It's safer if only I
know the answer to that.

41:43.057 --> 41:45.197
I'll find you once
the box is hidden.

41:46.588 --> 41:48.699
I don't need to tell you both...

41:48.978 --> 41:50.581
Be careful.

42:01.140 --> 42:03.366
I don't like it when
Zedd goes off by himself.

42:05.016 --> 42:07.908
He's willing to take the risk
for the sake of your quest.

42:09.359 --> 42:11.379
In the crypt he was ready to sacrifice you.

42:12.814 --> 42:14.555
He was jsut doing what he had to.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.533
To keep us from becomeing
like Vivian and Kieran.

42:19.422 --> 42:20.773
That won't happen.

42:21.648 --> 42:23.489
They probably thought the same thing.

42:24.619 --> 42:27.841
But in that moment of weakness,
they lost everything.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.985
You know, we're stronger than they were.

42:31.703 --> 42:33.009
I hope you're right.

42:34.951 --> 42:37.011
Love isn't something to fear, Kahlan.

42:39.754 --> 42:41.340
For me it is.
