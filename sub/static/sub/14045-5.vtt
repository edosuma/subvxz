00:00.977 --> 00:03.068
[Siren wails]

00:03.117 --> 00:04.999
Food poisoning at a zombie run?

00:05.011 --> 00:06.564
It's a 5K at night.

00:06.564 --> 00:09.227
Runners get chased by zombies in costume.

00:09.261 --> 00:11.029
Oh. I had a dream like that once.

00:11.030 --> 00:13.035
[Chuckles] Well, now it's our nightmare.

00:13.069 --> 00:13.835
Oh!

00:13.870 --> 00:14.859
Oh, oh!

00:14.893 --> 00:16.331
Let me give you a hand there.

00:16.364 --> 00:19.392
[Cellphone ringing]

00:19.393 --> 00:21.525
-

00:21.583 --> 00:22.266
[Sighs]

00:22.278 --> 00:25.018
- So, when does TC move in?
- He's not, okay?

00:25.018 --> 00:26.570
- We're taking it slow.
- Mm-hmm.

00:26.583 --> 00:29.547
Last time you said that, you
jumped him in an elevator.

00:29.582 --> 00:32.651
Well, we were living in
the moment, for a change.

00:33.453 --> 00:36.300
- [Cellphone vibrates]
- Oh, excuse me.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.476
This is Dr. Alexander.

00:40.077 --> 00:42.412
Stop calling me.

00:44.173 --> 00:46.571
- Was that that prison creep again?
- Yeah.

00:46.606 --> 00:48.150
Guy drinks a bottle of
shampoo on the way to court

00:48.174 --> 00:49.462
and he blames me for pumping his stomach.

00:49.486 --> 00:51.286
Just let me call my friend in
the Department of Corrections.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.683
He'll reach out and make him stop.

00:52.717 --> 00:54.933
No, because it's exactly what
he wants, you know... attention.

00:54.957 --> 00:56.086
And he's not gonna get it, all right?

00:56.110 --> 00:58.645
He's got another ten years in there.
I'm just gonna change my number again.

00:58.669 --> 01:01.227
- TC still doesn't know?
- No.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.522
And I'm not gonna tell him, and
neither are <i>you,</i> okay?

01:04.557 --> 01:06.453
There's no point in getting
him worked up about this.

01:06.477 --> 01:09.835
You know how he gets... a
tad overprotective. So ixnay.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.317
- [Loudspeaker beeps]
- <i>Dr. Callahan and Alister...</i>

01:11.341 --> 01:13.292
Oren? Uh, Oren Edwards?

01:13.325 --> 01:14.763
Uh, that's me.

01:14.797 --> 01:17.707
Hey. Um, I'm Dr. Cummings. How can I help?

01:17.741 --> 01:18.540
Hey, doc.

01:18.573 --> 01:20.523
I'm a welder at Ballard Refinery,

01:20.557 --> 01:23.179
and, uh, I hurt my thigh
at the end of a shift.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.052
I went home, but it got worse.

01:25.053 --> 01:26.126
Got more sore.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.683
Gotcha. Maybe it's a muscle pull. Okay.

01:28.717 --> 01:30.572
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah, it's pretty tender.

01:30.605 --> 01:31.321
- [Chuckles]
- Okay.

01:31.322 --> 01:32.916
I had a pipe burst on me,

01:32.927 --> 01:36.230
and, uh, my leg just caught
a chunk of metal here.

01:36.231 --> 01:37.611
[Exhales]

01:37.646 --> 01:38.796
As you can see...

01:38.829 --> 01:39.851
[Groans]

01:39.885 --> 01:41.547
Tried to stop the bleeding, but...

01:41.582 --> 01:42.411
Sorry.

01:42.446 --> 01:45.041
It's okay. No, no, no, no. We'll get
somebody to take care of that, all right?

01:45.047 --> 01:47.541
- Not feeling so hot, as you can tell.
- All right, well, we'll, uh,

01:47.565 --> 01:48.886
we'll get you fixed up, all right?

01:48.910 --> 01:50.859
- We'll get you an X-ray.
- Thanks.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.107
- Oh, thanks.
- Yep.

01:52.363 --> 01:54.057
Topher: TC, some guy hit a bunch of people

01:54.090 --> 01:55.433
at the zombie run starting line.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.001
It's gonna be a bit messy.

01:57.876 --> 02:00.272
- Bastard came out of nowhere!
- Hey, hey, hey, let us through.

02:00.273 --> 02:01.331
- Come on, we're doctors.
- Out of the way, out of the way.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.280
He came out of nowhere!

02:02.315 --> 02:03.592
That guy just ran into 'em.

02:03.627 --> 02:04.841
Man: He hit them!

02:08.282 --> 02:09.513
Oh, his neck's snapped.

02:09.547 --> 02:10.476
- Laura: Help me!
- Cord is gone.

02:10.477 --> 02:13.758
Drew! Drew, take the woman over
there. Myself and Gwen got the driver!

02:13.759 --> 02:15.012
- Excuse me.
- Come on, man.

02:15.023 --> 02:18.191
- Man: Stop blocking the car.
- Laura: Somebody help me!

02:18.192 --> 02:19.538
I'm Dr. Alister. What's your name?

02:19.562 --> 02:20.562
Laura Davis.

02:21.162 --> 02:23.593
- Okay.
- [Groaning]

02:23.627 --> 02:24.873
Pulse is thready.

02:24.907 --> 02:28.851
Looks like heroin. Maybe he OD'd?

02:28.862 --> 02:29.995
I can't feel my arm.

02:30.007 --> 02:32.446
Laura, you're gonna be fine. But
I need you to hold still, okay?

02:32.447 --> 02:34.802
You may have a spinal injury
after getting hit by the truck.

02:34.808 --> 02:36.840
I-I didn't get hit.

02:36.875 --> 02:37.993
I didn't.

02:38.327 --> 02:39.263
Driver: Mikey?

02:39.269 --> 02:40.731
He's lost a lot of blood.
Where's the bleeder?

02:40.732 --> 02:42.258
He's not an addict. He's a cop.

02:46.447 --> 02:47.470
Whose film is this?

02:47.471 --> 02:48.302
Paul's patient.

02:48.303 --> 02:49.973
Radiology messed up the X-ray, so he...

02:50.006 --> 02:52.117
Paul took him to CT yes.

02:52.636 --> 02:53.402
Oh, that was fun.

02:53.436 --> 02:54.394
You know, I can't believe

02:54.427 --> 02:56.314
I've been back in Texas for a year

02:56.347 --> 02:57.604
and I haven't ridden a horse until today.

02:57.628 --> 02:59.300
Yeah, I couldn't tell, you
know, 'cause you're a natural.

02:59.324 --> 03:01.178
[Scoffs] Yeah, and you're a bad liar.

03:01.212 --> 03:03.642
- [Chuckles] Hey, hang on a second.
- [Cellphone rings]

03:03.675 --> 03:04.985
[Cellphone beeps]

03:05.020 --> 03:07.034
Dr. Toussaint.

03:07.744 --> 03:09.086
[Chuckles]

03:09.234 --> 03:10.320
I got it?

03:10.780 --> 03:11.994
Thanks.

03:12.028 --> 03:13.421
Au revoir.

03:13.506 --> 03:16.573
[Laughing] Yes!

03:16.745 --> 03:21.018
I-I-I... I got a field surgery
gig with Doctors Without Borders.

03:21.052 --> 03:24.826
So, wait, y-y-you're leaving?
I mean, you just got here.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.386
I go to Haiti next week
to start field training.

03:27.419 --> 03:28.985
[Laughs] It's wild, huh?

03:29.020 --> 03:30.394
[Laughing] Yeah, it's wild.

03:30.428 --> 03:31.610
You know, I just...

03:31.644 --> 03:33.540
I realized how much I
missed being out in the field

03:33.564 --> 03:35.194
since I left the air force.

03:35.228 --> 03:36.709
You know, it's where I belong.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.980
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

03:39.292 --> 03:41.146
[Cellphone vibrates]

03:42.837 --> 03:44.762
We got a spinal trauma coming in.

03:44.796 --> 03:45.796
Okay.

03:46.348 --> 03:47.802
The... the X-ray's accurate?

03:47.835 --> 03:49.722
I've seen film like this in Iraq...

03:49.755 --> 03:51.596
Civilians hit by depleted uranium.

03:52.476 --> 03:54.585
He's wearing a radiation badge.

03:54.592 --> 03:57.914
Refineries use X-rays to fight pipe leaks.

03:57.947 --> 03:58.874
Maybe...

03:58.907 --> 03:59.961
Has he puked?

03:59.996 --> 04:01.147
Uh, no, not that I kn...

04:03.405 --> 04:05.369
[Geiger counter clicking]

04:05.404 --> 04:07.354
What... what does that mean?

04:07.387 --> 04:10.218
You've been exposed to a
radioactive isotope, Mr. Edwards.

04:10.219 --> 04:11.146
Radio...

04:11.147 --> 04:13.001
You mean like... like Spider-Man?

04:13.001 --> 04:14.632
Not exactly. Come here.

04:14.635 --> 04:15.771
[Sighing] Oh, what?

04:15.772 --> 04:17.817
Did you touch him without gloves?

04:17.851 --> 04:19.962
I, uh, I palpated his thigh.

04:19.995 --> 04:22.041
Did you eat or drink anything after that?

04:22.076 --> 04:23.076
Doughnut.

04:23.946 --> 04:26.996
You know, if... if he contaminated
you with nuclear material,

04:26.997 --> 04:29.732
he might have exposed other people, too.
How long was he in that waiting room?

04:29.756 --> 04:32.851
I, um... couple hours, maybe.
Um, he dropped a bloody bandage.

04:32.876 --> 04:34.398
I-I told housekeeping, though.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.537
Oh, fantastic. Stay... stay here.

04:36.572 --> 04:37.753
[Coughs]

04:45.046 --> 04:50.022
[Geiger counter clicking]

04:51.676 --> 04:53.114
Son of a...

04:58.049 --> 04:59.168
[Amplified] Attention.

04:59.201 --> 05:01.375
This is Dr. Zia, ER Chief.

05:01.410 --> 05:03.135
We have a lockdown in the ER.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.344
Repeat... The ER is on lockdown.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:21.768 --> 05:24.409
Ye... no, we are shut to
trauma. Isotope contamination.

05:24.474 --> 05:27.849
No. No ER patients in the OR,
okay? We'll have to decontaminate.

05:27.879 --> 05:31.124
We are all hands on deck. We have
to contain this contamination.

05:31.151 --> 05:33.536
Please gear up, mop the
bloody footprints from

05:33.542 --> 05:35.180
the waiting room so no
one else gets exposed.

05:35.192 --> 05:37.326
You got it. I'll get
you the lead aprons, too.

05:37.327 --> 05:40.679
And... and HazMat bags! Anything
exposed to radioactive blood is live!

05:40.712 --> 05:41.744
I got security on the doors.

05:41.768 --> 05:43.216
- Incoming!
- Whoa! We're closed to trauma!

05:43.240 --> 05:44.198
Radiation exposure. We heard.

05:44.233 --> 05:46.631
We got two critical. This one's a cop.
He'll never make it in time to County.

05:46.642 --> 05:48.033
Jordan, Trauma One with TC.

05:48.034 --> 05:49.370
Drew: Laura Davis... slurred speech,

05:49.376 --> 05:51.527
non-traumatic paralysis
in the upper extremities,

05:51.561 --> 05:54.055
possible CVA. Needs a head CT stat.

05:54.089 --> 05:56.402
Joey, Krista, Trauma Two.
And avoid quarantine areas.

05:56.408 --> 05:58.023
- That's my patient.
- Joey and Krista have her.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.213
I need a resident to triage the
parking lot. We're code green, okay?

06:01.214 --> 06:02.357
No one in or out!

06:03.376 --> 06:05.992
CT scan's 86'd because
of the contamination.

06:06.153 --> 06:08.509
Laura, I'm Dr. Chavez. How are you doing?

06:08.527 --> 06:10.828
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

06:10.835 --> 06:14.087
It's understandable, okay? We're going
to figure this out. I see you're a runner?

06:14.121 --> 06:17.882
[Slurring] I-I ran tr-track since
middle school, and my dad coached.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.335
- He died at 40.
- That's young.

06:19.368 --> 06:21.222
Do you know what the cause of death was?

06:21.257 --> 06:22.182
A berry an...

06:22.217 --> 06:23.142
A berry aneurysm?

06:23.177 --> 06:25.033
Huh? Is that it?

06:25.034 --> 06:26.394
No response. BP is spiking.

06:26.395 --> 06:29.510
All right, listen, I want a nitro
drip when we land and ten of morphine.

06:29.545 --> 06:33.408
We should push IV tPA. If it's a clot,
tPA will dissolve it, stop her paralysis.

06:33.488 --> 06:35.292
No, if it's a brain
bleed, that'll kill her.

06:35.316 --> 06:37.000
Her father died of a
sub-arachnoid hemorrhage.

06:37.012 --> 06:38.087
One, two, three.

06:38.121 --> 06:39.783
- Got her. All right.
- All right.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.137
But how can we tell without a head CT?

06:41.161 --> 06:43.021
Got to look at the body.
The body will tell you what

06:43.045 --> 06:44.926
you need to know if you
look in the right place.

06:46.866 --> 06:49.594
Spinal fluid... 'Cause it
passes through the brain.

06:49.918 --> 06:51.891
And even a few drops of
blood or xanthochromia

06:51.892 --> 06:53.457
in the cerebrospinal fluid, it's a bleed.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.599
That's my girl.

06:54.632 --> 06:57.510
Dr. Chavez, we have a stab
wound. We need a surgical consult.

06:57.511 --> 07:00.284
All right. Krista, prep
her for the spinal tap.

07:00.325 --> 07:03.418
Let's get a portable chest and
two units of O neg. Strip and flip.

07:03.430 --> 07:07.357
[Monitor beeping]

07:07.358 --> 07:09.063
Got bullet wounds. Is he a vet?

07:09.097 --> 07:12.085
Undercover cop. He got stabbed in
a drug deal, crashed driving in.

07:12.096 --> 07:14.951
He's got a deep wound by his shoulder
blade. I dressed it in the field.

07:14.984 --> 07:17.232
He's got a punctured lung. Let's
get a chest tube started now.

07:17.256 --> 07:19.547
Fluid's kicking in.
He's starting to wake up.

07:19.564 --> 07:23.490
Detective, I'm Dr. Callahan. You
are in San Antonio Memorial Hospital.

07:23.491 --> 07:24.641
You've been stabbed.

07:24.658 --> 07:26.502
I don't want to go, Mikey.

07:26.537 --> 07:28.455
Please, Mikey.

07:28.488 --> 07:29.798
BP's crashing.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.687
I don't wanna go... I don't wanna go...

07:31.720 --> 07:35.577
No breath sounds on the right. Okay, where
is that X-ray? He needs a chest tube now.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.095
Must be seeing a ghost.

07:37.128 --> 07:39.166
Well, he's lost a lot of blood.
That can make the brain hallucinate.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.519
That's, uh, one explanation.

07:40.552 --> 07:43.493
I'm gonna make the intercostal incision.

07:43.511 --> 07:45.027
You believe in ghosts, Dr. Chavez?

07:45.051 --> 07:48.522
I believe we all have a soul that
leaves our bodies when we die.

07:48.523 --> 07:50.183
This cop's not dying tonight.

07:54.089 --> 07:55.910
Where is everybody?

07:55.945 --> 07:57.830
At a safe distance.

07:58.921 --> 08:00.640
The isotope is still in our systems,

08:00.647 --> 08:07.238
which means we can infect other people with
radiation through our saliva, sweat, urine.

08:07.273 --> 08:08.646
[Sighs] Sorry about this, Doc.

08:10.728 --> 08:12.871
It's, uh... it's "Paul," Oren.

08:12.904 --> 08:16.455
You know, invisible things ar-are
really dangerous in a hospital...

08:16.488 --> 08:18.758
Bacteria, viruses.

08:18.793 --> 08:20.328
Why didn't you report your injury at work?

08:20.352 --> 08:24.717
You know, my old man worked there for
20 years, and he got me on part time

08:24.718 --> 08:26.919
to pay for this trip
we're taking next month.

08:26.952 --> 08:30.374
Guess I just didn't want to cause
any trouble for him, you know?

08:30.409 --> 08:32.134
Where you going?

08:32.169 --> 08:35.303
We're gonna do some
salmon fishing in Alaska,

08:35.336 --> 08:38.087
get this great view of Mount McKinley.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.198
There's moose, and eagles.

08:40.232 --> 08:42.520
It's badass. Yeah, you'd love it.

08:42.544 --> 08:44.295
But, my dad got emphysema.

08:44.328 --> 08:47.814
Welding gases from all those years
have just burned up his lungs.

08:47.849 --> 08:51.056
And we've been talking about
this trip since I was a kid.

08:51.057 --> 08:53.543
Now we're finally doing it.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.174
Good for you.

08:55.209 --> 08:56.646
[Sighs] Thanks.

08:56.681 --> 08:58.245
All right, all done.

08:58.251 --> 08:59.878
Hey, Doc... or Paul.

08:59.913 --> 09:02.726
I'm gonna be okay, right?

09:02.760 --> 09:07.239
Uh... We're... we're
both gonna be just fine.

09:07.272 --> 09:10.167
Joey: BP is coming up. That's nice work.

09:10.197 --> 09:12.422
Yeah. This guy's got so many lives.

09:12.456 --> 09:13.799
Somebody must be looking out for him.

09:13.805 --> 09:16.775
Yeah, speaking of looking out,
I'm gonna go check on Krista.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.806
- Oh, my God! Pete!
- Officer, you cannot be in here.

09:20.841 --> 09:23.014
He's my husband. Pete
Moreno. Is... is he...?

09:23.049 --> 09:24.822
He's fading in and out of consciousness.

09:24.846 --> 09:26.441
He was stabbed. He lost a lot of blood.

09:26.442 --> 09:29.254
But we placed a chest tube
so he could breathe better.

09:29.288 --> 09:30.246
He lied to me.

09:30.281 --> 09:33.734
Said he was going to the gym, then
went out on a bust without backup.

09:33.769 --> 09:35.704
Next thing I know, I get a call he's here.

09:36.495 --> 09:39.558
He's been talking to someone named Mikey.

09:39.592 --> 09:41.862
Mike Bennett, his partner.

09:41.897 --> 09:45.320
But... We lost him a few
years ago in a shootout.

09:45.368 --> 09:47.559
They were like brothers.

09:47.592 --> 09:48.688
[Voice breaking] Can I stay with him?

09:48.712 --> 09:49.735
Of course.

09:49.768 --> 09:52.167
- I'm gonna update Topher.
- Okay.

09:56.616 --> 09:57.671
[Cellphone vibrates]

10:01.041 --> 10:03.055
-

10:04.759 --> 10:06.126
[Cellphone beeps]

10:06.720 --> 10:09.909
Gwen, that guy you know... call him.

10:09.950 --> 10:13.062
His name's Cam Pollock?
All right. I'm on it.

10:13.096 --> 10:14.882
Yeah, well, the hospital's locked
down, but it doesn't require

10:14.888 --> 10:17.271
require stitches anyways. Just
go home, ice it, and wash it.

10:18.152 --> 10:20.755
Hey, you miss the memo?
Nobody in, nobody out.

10:20.779 --> 10:22.182
Another OD I ran out of Narcan.

10:22.217 --> 10:26.675
Lumber salesman. They found him
on the yard with this... Bad "H."

10:28.616 --> 10:30.214
All right, agonal breathing.

10:30.248 --> 10:34.087
Blue lips, clammy skin,
pupils are pinpoint.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.350
Here comes the Narcan.

10:37.385 --> 10:38.652
[Gasps]

10:39.614 --> 10:41.927
- Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.
- I got you.

10:41.960 --> 10:42.822
Where am I?

10:42.856 --> 10:47.302
Welcome to San Antonio Memorial.
You, sir, just had a heroin overdose.

10:47.337 --> 10:50.771
- Uh, I slipped a disk last year...
- I don't care why you took it.

10:52.577 --> 10:57.601
Do not take any more. This dope
is tainted. It will kill you.

11:01.897 --> 11:03.778
Do you need a number to a rehab facility?

11:03.852 --> 11:06.983
I... Messed up. Won't happen again.

11:07.016 --> 11:10.375
All right, well, just stay here. We'll
keep an eye on you, make sure you're okay.

11:10.408 --> 11:13.411
We'll get you inside when it's safe.
You've been unconscious for a while.

11:13.447 --> 11:16.454
No, I'm... I'm good. Thanks, man.

11:20.968 --> 11:22.343
You're not gonna call SAPD?

11:22.376 --> 11:24.038
I'm a doctor, not a cop.

11:24.073 --> 11:28.774
Everybody deals with pain in their own
way. Some just not as well as others.

11:28.808 --> 11:30.087
Yeah, I hear that.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.854
Hey, so, that Nurse Kenny...

11:34.889 --> 11:36.135
[Chuckles]

11:36.168 --> 11:39.100
What's his deal? He banging
that intern with the legs?

11:39.256 --> 11:41.990
Well, aren't you the
delicate, little flower.

11:42.024 --> 11:44.870
- Uh, yeah, they're involved.
- For now.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.493
I mean, a female doctor with a male
nurse... You ever seen that work?

11:47.517 --> 11:50.439
As a friend of them both, I'm
surprised it's lasted this long.

11:50.472 --> 11:53.190
- It's good to know.
- I didn't say anything.

11:53.225 --> 11:54.918
[Chuckles] Yes, you did.

11:54.952 --> 11:58.346
[Chuckles] Oh, hey. ER's locked down.

11:58.370 --> 11:59.847
But my brother-in-law's in there.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.638
I can get a message to his doctor.

12:01.672 --> 12:03.079
He <i>is</i> a doctor.

12:03.112 --> 12:04.454
TC Callahan.

12:04.489 --> 12:07.558
And I need to see him right now. (Sighs)

12:07.592 --> 12:09.737
We still have to remove the
foreign body in patient zero.

12:09.761 --> 12:11.526
Yeah, cesium's gnarly stuff.

12:11.561 --> 12:13.287
NRC Hotline give you an antidote?

12:13.320 --> 12:14.406
Prussian blue.

12:14.441 --> 12:17.817
It's rare, our pharmacy doesn't stock
it, and everybody's closed for the night.

12:17.836 --> 12:19.910
Oh, try Fort Hood. They might have it.

12:19.944 --> 12:20.903
Good idea.

12:20.936 --> 12:22.694
Oh, how's, uh, the undercover cop?

12:22.729 --> 12:23.783
He's hanging in there.

12:23.816 --> 12:25.408
He lost his partner a few years back.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.687
His wife's a cop, so Jordan's with her.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.734
A little close to home,
Tee. Maybe we should trade.

12:29.768 --> 12:31.238
No, no. I-I'll get him through it.

12:31.273 --> 12:32.231
[Cellphone vibrates]

12:32.264 --> 12:33.606
Oh, it's Drew. All right.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.420
- [Cellphone beeps]
- Drew, what's up?

12:35.432 --> 12:39.675
Tee, there's a woman out here, tells
me she's your sister-in-law, Annie.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.575
Says you've been ignoring her phone calls.

12:41.608 --> 12:43.430
Yeah. Um, put her on.

12:47.204 --> 12:48.358
Hey, baby.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.919
Hey, Annie. So, you're
here... in my parking lot?

12:50.952 --> 12:54.374
Atlanta sucks. I got a
nursing job in San Diego.

12:54.408 --> 12:56.006
Can I crash at your place?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.639
We can hang out, catch up.

12:57.672 --> 12:58.694
[Chuckles]

12:58.728 --> 13:00.505
We-well, thank you for the heads-up, Annie.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.774
I tried. You didn't answer. I
thought you were dodging my calls.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.782
No. Why would... why would I do that?

13:07.816 --> 13:11.366
Um, yeah, sure, you can crash.
Just, uh, there's a key above the...

13:11.400 --> 13:12.582
- Porch light?
- Yeah.

13:12.616 --> 13:14.727
- Some things never change.
- See you later.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.996
[Cellphone beeps]

13:17.118 --> 13:18.470
Topher: It's my job, Paul.

13:18.504 --> 13:21.702
That little piece of cesium can
kill everyone in this hospital.

13:22.418 --> 13:25.222
Right... Look, you...
you've trained me, Topher.

13:25.256 --> 13:30.101
You know I can remove it. Besides,
you have a wife, three kids.

13:30.125 --> 13:33.894
You know, I've... I've got... Me, right?

13:33.929 --> 13:38.374
So, look, I'm already exposed.
Why put you at risk, too?

13:38.408 --> 13:42.831
Because 60% of Oren's bone
marrow is in his pelvis.

13:42.844 --> 13:47.195
If you don't remove <i>all</i> the
contamination, his T cells will die.

13:47.357 --> 13:52.337
And then he will die an extremely
painful death from infection in two weeks,

13:52.361 --> 13:55.831
not to mention if you mishandle the cesium,

13:55.958 --> 13:59.107
you'll turn this hospital
into a nuclear wasteland.

14:00.323 --> 14:01.759
So you better be sure.

14:06.427 --> 14:09.549
[Monitor beeping, ventilator hissing]

14:09.597 --> 14:11.259
How's she doing?

14:11.287 --> 14:13.019
She's holding up.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.395
You were gone for a while.

14:14.429 --> 14:15.675
Is everything okay?

14:15.709 --> 14:17.915
Yeah, I just had to talk to Topher

14:17.949 --> 14:19.771
- about the radioactive guy.
- Mm.

14:19.805 --> 14:20.955
[Cellphone vibrating]

14:20.989 --> 14:21.989
You gonna get that?

14:22.013 --> 14:22.779
Um...

14:22.813 --> 14:24.219
[Vibrating continues]

14:24.253 --> 14:25.819
Just my mother.

14:25.853 --> 14:27.195
You okay?

14:27.229 --> 14:28.795
You seem distracted.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.754
Yeah. I just feel badly for her.

14:33.789 --> 14:34.683
[Alarm beeping]

14:34.716 --> 14:35.579
BP's dropping.

14:35.613 --> 14:36.891
What's happening?

14:36.925 --> 14:38.117
No new blood in the Thora-Seal.

14:38.141 --> 14:39.835
Distended neck veins. It's not his lungs.

14:39.868 --> 14:40.955
What does that mean?

14:40.989 --> 14:43.083
Muffled heart sounds and a rub.

14:43.107 --> 14:45.396
Okay, there's blood pooling around
the heart, and we need to drain it.

14:45.402 --> 14:47.419
Denise... I need you to
step out, please. Out.

14:47.452 --> 14:49.403
Prep for bedside ultrasound.

14:49.437 --> 14:50.715
Hand me a spinal needle.

14:57.052 --> 14:58.681
Okay. I'm ready.

14:59.676 --> 15:01.915
Slowly.

15:02.409 --> 15:03.560
You're in.

15:04.893 --> 15:06.555
[Beeping continues]

15:06.589 --> 15:09.851
Ah, damn it. His blood's clotted.
It's too thick for the needle.

15:09.884 --> 15:11.707
- Pressure's dropping.
- Scalpel.

15:12.668 --> 15:14.085
You're gonna do a pericardial window?

15:14.109 --> 15:17.029
We have to remove the clot. We can't
go upstairs. We do it here, or he dies.

15:17.053 --> 15:18.619
[Rapid beeping]

15:19.203 --> 15:20.203
Okay.

15:22.500 --> 15:26.198
You want to feel for the
L4-L5 intervertebral space.

15:26.203 --> 15:28.955
Go slowly till you feel a pop.

15:28.988 --> 15:31.706
All right, you're good, Krista. Trust it.

15:34.492 --> 15:35.963
[Gasps] I think I got it.

15:35.997 --> 15:38.491
All right, cool. Now remove the stylet.

15:38.525 --> 15:42.139
Let the tube fill with clear fluid.

15:42.172 --> 15:43.851
- Uh...
- Whoa.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.605
Damn it. Did... did I
hit an artery? I jus...

15:45.629 --> 15:47.835
No, no, she ruptured a cerebral aneurysm.

15:47.869 --> 15:50.139
Tell radiology we're on the way, all right?

15:50.173 --> 15:53.434
I need a coil embolization, stat. Okay,
we got to stop this bleeding in her brain.

15:54.877 --> 15:55.877
[Exhales]

15:55.901 --> 15:59.259
Topher: Remove the cesium intact,
or you'll increase his exposure.

16:01.468 --> 16:02.468
Got it.

16:02.493 --> 16:07.575
That? That's it? That little
thing? That's my kryptonite?

16:07.677 --> 16:08.930
That is it.

16:09.756 --> 16:11.195
Wow.

16:11.228 --> 16:14.875
Okay, I, uh, will be right back. Okay.

16:18.525 --> 16:21.725
These guys are from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. They'll take it from here.

16:22.781 --> 16:24.381
Thank you, gentlemen.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.259
[Exhales] Piece of cake.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.352
What's, uh, what's next?

16:29.386 --> 16:30.930
Well, next is the hard part...

16:30.931 --> 16:32.927
Cutting away the exposed
tissue in Oren's thigh.

16:32.938 --> 16:35.581
It's messy, so watch
for further contamination

16:35.587 --> 16:37.792
from blood or needle sticks. Okay.

16:37.817 --> 16:41.416
One mistake, and you could
end up as sick as he is.

16:42.338 --> 16:45.408
We've had our ups and downs,
you know, since Mikey died.

16:45.442 --> 16:47.168
Pete still blames himself.

16:47.202 --> 16:50.112
It's why he has to save people.

16:50.146 --> 16:52.192
Always puts himself last.

16:52.225 --> 16:53.760
Yeah, I know someone like that.

16:53.794 --> 16:57.184
Everybody warned me.

16:57.218 --> 16:59.039
But I thought he'd changed.

16:59.074 --> 17:01.001
Guess I was kidding myself.

17:03.394 --> 17:06.271
Not that it's any of my business,

17:06.306 --> 17:08.300
but the hardest part is realizing

17:08.301 --> 17:12.617
that their recovery is about
<i>them,</i> not about <i>you.</i>

17:15.074 --> 17:16.672
I really do love him.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.528
Yeah.

17:18.561 --> 17:20.064
I get it.

17:22.593 --> 17:24.319
Oren: Ugggh.

17:24.354 --> 17:26.048
I can't look. It makes me dizzy.

17:26.082 --> 17:28.127
Well, you're doing great, Oren.

17:28.162 --> 17:29.952
Nice work, Paul.

17:29.986 --> 17:32.992
Excellent, excellent touch.
Your dad would be proud.

17:35.266 --> 17:38.624
Ohhh. Your dad some big-shot Doc?

17:38.657 --> 17:43.360
Uh, just one of the top neurosurgeons in
the country, but, you know, no pressure.

17:43.394 --> 17:45.056
Just like being Superman's kid.

17:45.090 --> 17:48.704
Oh, that must suck. If
you don't mind me asking.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.875
Why did you become a doctor, then?

17:50.880 --> 17:52.160
I don't know.

17:52.194 --> 17:54.848
Just what we... we do in my family.

17:54.881 --> 17:57.760
You know, me and my brothers, my sister.

17:57.794 --> 18:02.034
Well, maybe you can be Superman
somewhere else, like the ocean.

18:02.058 --> 18:03.982
Well, that would make me Aquaman, so...

18:03.993 --> 18:05.450
That's right. [Chuckling] That's right.

18:05.474 --> 18:08.288
[Groans] Well, Aquaman
still fights bad guys.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.653
And he gets to, like, talk to
whales and dolphins and stuff.

18:11.684 --> 18:13.121
Good point.

18:13.538 --> 18:14.752
How about you?

18:14.785 --> 18:19.935
Yeah, I, uh, I partied a lot. I partied
my way out of college. [Chuckles]

18:19.970 --> 18:24.249
But, uh, my dad was okay. You
know, he said you got to screw up

18:24.267 --> 18:27.200
to know what you want to
do. I took that advice,

18:27.234 --> 18:32.117
and now I'm thinking about going to,
like, a culinary arts institute, you know?

18:32.333 --> 18:34.560
Your dad sounds like a cool guy.

18:35.247 --> 18:41.082
Yeah. Well, my mom split when I
was 4, and, uh, now I tell everybody

18:41.083 --> 18:45.519
that I feel like I won the dad
lottery. And it's true. I did.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.360
I wouldn't trade my life with anybody else.

18:49.410 --> 18:50.848
You know about me and Krista?

18:50.882 --> 18:51.967
What? Hooking up?

18:52.002 --> 18:53.691
[Laughing] Come on, man. It's a hospital.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.744
You can't hide that.

18:58.562 --> 19:01.088
Yeah, I like her.

19:01.121 --> 19:02.272
I do.

19:03.778 --> 19:06.144
You know, we, uh...

19:06.177 --> 19:08.934
We started out just having
fun, but now it seems like

19:08.959 --> 19:11.082
like she doesn't want to
take things to the next level.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.907
Well, maybe she doesn't
want anything serious.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.974
Wants to focus on her
career. Career is important.

19:15.975 --> 19:20.096
Let me tell you something.
My dad worked in construction,

19:20.130 --> 19:24.511
and I promised him and myself that
I was never gonna work with my hands.

19:24.546 --> 19:25.696
[Laughs]

19:25.729 --> 19:27.936
Now your broke ass is mopping
floors, slinging trash.

19:27.970 --> 19:29.696
- [Laughs]
- You're right, Kenny.

19:29.730 --> 19:33.164
But one day, I am gonna be a Doc,
which makes all this crap worth it.

19:33.518 --> 19:34.621
What you have to ask yourself

19:34.626 --> 19:36.153
is what makes it all worth it for <i>you.</i>

19:36.352 --> 19:38.545
Are you just gonna be the
"good time Charlie" of the ER,

19:38.569 --> 19:40.610
or are you really gonna
make something of your life?

19:40.929 --> 19:42.529
Thought we were talking about Krista.

19:42.553 --> 19:44.730
Yeah. It's all tied in.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.613
If you're this frustrated
with your life at 30,

19:47.643 --> 19:49.792
you're really gonna be pissed off at 40.

19:50.345 --> 19:52.745
Anyway, good luck with Krista.

19:52.746 --> 19:56.387
Oh, and if she ever needs a
replacement... [Clicks tongue]

19:56.447 --> 19:59.827
[Chuckles] Man, she'd
crush you like a damn bug.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.848
Ooh, yeah! What a way to go out, though.

20:02.861 --> 20:04.127
- Whoo-hoo!
- [Chuckles]

20:04.162 --> 20:05.216
Will she recover?

20:05.250 --> 20:07.328
We won't know until she wakes up.

20:07.361 --> 20:08.800
But she's lucky.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.712
Usually a bleed-out like
that is found on autopsy.

20:11.746 --> 20:15.086
Thanks to your excellent
diagnosis, we got her in time.

20:15.128 --> 20:16.746
Yeah, which I wouldn't
have made without you.

20:16.770 --> 20:18.526
Unless you had field experience.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.024
You know, TC, Drew, Topher, myself...

20:21.057 --> 20:23.104
We don't need machines to be good doctors.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.512
We trust our instincts.

20:24.545 --> 20:25.840
I'm not exactly army material.

20:25.852 --> 20:27.650
You should do Doctors Without Borders

20:27.656 --> 20:29.216
when you're done with your residency.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.168
It'd be the best thing for your career.

20:31.201 --> 20:33.216
I just... I'm not sure they would take me.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.528
Why do you think that?

20:34.562 --> 20:36.992
You need to stop judging yourself so much.

20:37.025 --> 20:39.903
I see someone that could
be a brilliant doctor.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.823
You just have to get out of your own way.

20:43.426 --> 20:45.472
You know, it's hard. I just...

20:45.493 --> 20:48.022
I was that kid that would
get 98 on a test, and

20:48.023 --> 20:50.887
I'd just be so pissed that I didn't
get 100. But I'm still that kid.

20:50.941 --> 20:52.319
And that makes you happy?

20:53.089 --> 20:54.112
No.

20:54.145 --> 20:56.736
- So, then change.
- It's not that easy.

20:56.769 --> 20:59.455
See? There you go, getting in your own way.

20:59.981 --> 21:03.360
I got to get up to personnel and
tell them that I'm out of here.

21:03.393 --> 21:05.118
You know, Scott's gonna be pissed.

21:05.129 --> 21:09.747
[Chuckles] Yeah, he's not the
one I care about disappointing.

21:18.138 --> 21:19.521
We are still contaminated,

21:19.545 --> 21:22.465
so I-I will let you know
as soon as I know, okay?

21:24.634 --> 21:26.964
EMS is on my ass to reopen.

21:26.982 --> 21:29.465
The rest of the county is
overloaded thanks to us.

21:29.466 --> 21:32.555
Well, I talked to my boys at Fort Hood.
They can overnight the prussian blue.

21:33.414 --> 21:36.507
Oren's exposure's in his
pelvis. He'll be dead by morning.

21:36.998 --> 21:39.684
If you make the poison, make
the f'ing antidote, too, right?

21:39.718 --> 21:43.364
Yeah, well, exposure to cesium-137's
pretty rare. So, so is the antidote.

21:43.398 --> 21:45.509
Actually, it's not rare at all.

21:45.542 --> 21:49.316
Prussian blue is an ink. It's the
same compound used to print blueprints.

21:50.086 --> 21:53.348
I've been brushing up on my
toxicology for my medical boards.

21:53.382 --> 21:55.268
[Garbage bag snaps]

21:57.287 --> 21:58.245
Blueprints.

21:58.278 --> 21:59.748
Hey.

22:01.510 --> 22:03.588
How's Denise?

22:03.622 --> 22:05.429
She's holding up.

22:06.374 --> 22:08.580
Her husband lied to her.

22:08.614 --> 22:10.375
Yeah... to protect her.

22:11.366 --> 22:12.804
Maybe she doesn't need protection.

22:12.838 --> 22:15.972
Where have I heard that before? Huh?

22:16.006 --> 22:17.540
[Cellphone vibrates]

22:17.574 --> 22:19.140
Midnight caller?

22:19.174 --> 22:20.516
[Sighs] My bookie.

22:20.550 --> 22:23.839
He wants me to start betting
again. He misses the income.

22:23.846 --> 22:25.060
Yeah, bet he does.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.148
[Alarm beeping]

22:27.185 --> 22:28.228
He's throwing PVCs.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.308
Or maybe the chest tube's
irritating his heart.

22:30.646 --> 22:33.140
- Did his X-rays come back yet?
- There.

22:33.702 --> 22:35.876
Tee, it's a foreign body.

22:35.910 --> 22:37.284
Damn it. That's a knife blade.

22:37.318 --> 22:40.708
It probably broke off when he was
stabbed. It's right next to his heart.

22:40.743 --> 22:41.797
He's in V-fib.

22:42.854 --> 22:43.908
Paddles at 200.

22:43.942 --> 22:45.466
[Paddles thump]

22:45.497 --> 22:46.497
Still V-fib.

22:46.822 --> 22:47.716
Pushing to 300.

22:47.750 --> 22:48.644
Tee, wait.

22:48.678 --> 22:50.030
The shock is moving the blade tip.

22:50.054 --> 22:52.484
If you shock him again, it's
gonna tear his heart into ribbons.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.254
Okay, we need to get it
out. Cutting him open.

22:54.278 --> 22:56.317
- Hand me a rib spreader and a ten blade.
- Gotcha.

23:02.022 --> 23:03.160
That's medicine?

23:03.271 --> 23:05.552
It was in a soda bottle.

23:05.743 --> 23:07.309
Uh, it's actually printer's ink.

23:07.718 --> 23:09.772
Uh, paramedic picked it up
from the newspaper plant.

23:09.796 --> 23:11.205
Same chemical structure.

23:11.238 --> 23:14.403
The cesium in your intestines will
bond with the crystals in the ink,

23:14.404 --> 23:16.514
and you will evacuate the contaminant.

23:17.318 --> 23:18.181
Will it hurt?

23:18.214 --> 23:19.493
Not at all.

23:19.526 --> 23:21.540
Though your, uh, your
poop will be bright blue.

23:24.198 --> 23:25.732
What if it doesn't work?

23:25.766 --> 23:28.409
Right. We'll cross that
bridge when we get to it, okay?

23:28.426 --> 23:31.300
Sorry, but you... you've
been saying that a lot.

23:31.334 --> 23:34.084
This... this will help you.

23:34.861 --> 23:35.908
It's gonna help.

23:35.942 --> 23:37.316
Okay.

23:37.350 --> 23:38.628
Okay.

23:38.662 --> 23:42.916
All right, um, you will
feel a gag in your throat.

23:42.950 --> 23:44.196
[Breathing shakily]

23:44.230 --> 23:45.860
Sorry.

23:45.894 --> 23:47.204
That's... that's okay.

23:47.238 --> 23:49.764
Hey, uh, do... do me a favor, okay?

23:49.798 --> 23:52.068
All right. Close your eyes.

23:52.102 --> 23:53.188
[Chuckles lightly]

23:53.222 --> 23:54.222
- That's okay.
- Okay.

23:54.246 --> 23:55.460
All right, close your eyes.

23:55.494 --> 23:56.494
Okay.

23:56.617 --> 23:59.431
Now, imagine you're on
Crescent Lake with your dad.

24:06.726 --> 24:09.796
Geigered everything... CT,
waiting room, bathrooms.

24:09.830 --> 24:10.981
- All done.
- Great.

24:11.014 --> 24:14.628
Doctor thing doesn't work out, you
got a bright future in housekeeping.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.964
Okay, let's reopen to trauma. Tell Drew,

24:16.998 --> 24:19.020
and, uh, take down all the caution tape

24:19.021 --> 24:21.604
except for this side of
the floor. Thanks, Kenny.

24:21.638 --> 24:25.546
Oren stays quarantined till we know
how he responds to the antidote.

24:35.901 --> 24:37.852
[Engine shuts off]

24:39.846 --> 24:40.804
Back again?

24:40.838 --> 24:42.052
I'm not the only one.

24:42.086 --> 24:43.566
So is the guy who said
he learned his lesson.

24:43.590 --> 24:44.964
[Sighs]

24:48.582 --> 24:50.052
What happened?

24:50.086 --> 24:52.420
Got called to Alamo Plaza, man down.

24:52.454 --> 24:54.308
He was dead when I arrived.

24:56.326 --> 24:57.476
What a waste.

24:57.510 --> 24:59.780
Hey, he refused care.
What else could you do?

25:00.670 --> 25:01.658
Hey, can you let me in?

25:01.659 --> 25:04.410
I got to fax some paperwork before
I transfer him to the morgue.

25:04.428 --> 25:05.920
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

25:08.678 --> 25:10.212
Damn! How long's it gonna be?

25:10.246 --> 25:11.460
Tell you when we're ready.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.052
[Beeping]

25:14.086 --> 25:16.356
- Thanks.
- You're letting that bitch in there?

25:17.222 --> 25:18.468
What'd you call me?

25:18.502 --> 25:20.100
A bitch, <i>bitch.</i>

25:20.134 --> 25:21.469
Look, back up...

25:23.142 --> 25:25.827
Drew, man! What the
hell?! What are you doing?

25:25.851 --> 25:27.236
He was trying to come in.

25:27.270 --> 25:29.668
That fine. We're open again.

25:30.406 --> 25:31.428
I'll get a gurney.

25:31.462 --> 25:35.076
Your white blood cell count was
lower, but that... that was expected.

25:35.109 --> 25:37.348
Next test will tell us
how the antidote did.

25:37.382 --> 25:39.748
It's a bummer we never
got superpowers, Paul.

25:39.782 --> 25:40.900
[Chuckles]

25:40.934 --> 25:43.172
If we, uh, if we did, what would yours be?

25:43.206 --> 25:44.438
Go back in time.

25:44.468 --> 25:46.569
Like, fly super fast, but in reverse.

25:46.581 --> 25:49.828
Well, uh, what... what era
would you, uh, travel to?

25:49.862 --> 25:53.764
Like, uh, to meet Lincoln or Da Vinci?

25:53.798 --> 25:56.004
This morning, before I got hurt,

25:56.038 --> 25:59.140
and I would blow off work
today like Ferris Bueller.

25:59.174 --> 26:00.260
[Laughs]

26:00.294 --> 26:01.894
- You ever seen that movie?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:03.639 --> 26:04.639
What's th...

26:06.246 --> 26:07.629
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, it's... it's okay.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.941
- Is it?
- Um... Platelets are down. Here.

26:08.965 --> 26:10.670
- Paul.
- Here, hold this... hold this up there.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.196
Okay.

26:12.230 --> 26:13.796
[Breathing heavily]

26:13.830 --> 26:15.972
I kind of... I kind of can't breathe, Paul.

26:16.006 --> 26:17.732
You're fine. You're fine. Don't panic.

26:17.766 --> 26:19.172
Legs up, okay?

26:19.206 --> 26:20.100
- [Gasping]
- Hey, no, no.

26:20.133 --> 26:21.220
Can't... Paul.

26:21.254 --> 26:22.308
- [Wheezing]
- No, no, no.

26:22.342 --> 26:23.652
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:23.686 --> 26:24.686
Oren?

26:25.096 --> 26:26.066
Hey.

26:26.114 --> 26:28.744
I-I need help here! Somebody
somebody grab Topher!

26:34.366 --> 26:36.295
All these cops out here
and you knock the guy out?

26:36.319 --> 26:37.789
He started it. I was just...

26:37.823 --> 26:38.823
Protecting me.

26:39.903 --> 26:41.149
Okay.

26:41.182 --> 26:44.212
Hey, look, I'm on your team, all
right, but get your stories straight.

26:44.213 --> 26:45.495
This isn't just going away.

26:46.334 --> 26:49.245
- A crazy night, right?
- They're <i>all</i> crazy.

26:49.279 --> 26:50.795
You talking about doctors now?

26:53.295 --> 26:55.501
Ragosa: Where's Topher?!
Paul's guy's coding!

26:57.327 --> 26:58.766
Drew: Paul, what do you have?

26:58.799 --> 27:00.159
He's dehydrated from vomiting,

27:00.171 --> 27:02.084
electrolyte imbalance triggered
V-fib, and he lost his pulse.

27:02.085 --> 27:03.960
- What you're gonna do...
- I got it. I got it.

27:04.407 --> 27:06.069
Don't leave me. I got you.

27:06.079 --> 27:06.845
[Paddles thump]

27:06.864 --> 27:10.256
[Gasping]

27:10.275 --> 27:11.041
Paul?

27:11.042 --> 27:12.679
Hey. Hey.

27:13.339 --> 27:15.232
What happened, Paul?

27:15.233 --> 27:19.071
You went away, but I, uh, I got you back.

27:19.079 --> 27:20.709
[Voice breaking] Oh, thank you.

27:21.076 --> 27:26.323
[Monitor beeping]

27:26.324 --> 27:28.577
Blade's not anterior.
Must be behind the heart.

27:28.578 --> 27:30.075
Careful, tee. One slip...

27:30.081 --> 27:32.798
No, he's come this far. I'm
not letting him down now.

27:33.718 --> 27:34.894
Okay, I got it.

27:36.253 --> 27:38.341
I'm worried about cutting the vena cava.

27:40.469 --> 27:42.574
- Curved Kelly.
- Yeah.

27:43.455 --> 27:45.150
Okay.

27:45.183 --> 27:46.685
Closer.

27:46.719 --> 27:48.061
Almost there.

27:50.173 --> 27:50.781
Got it.

27:50.816 --> 27:51.838
[High-pitched beeping]

27:51.871 --> 27:53.725
Heart's fibrillating.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.019
Okay. Give me some room.

27:57.837 --> 28:00.552
Good. Good, good. I got it.

28:05.728 --> 28:07.517
[Sighing] Nice.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.096
- [High-pitched beeping stops]
- Heart's back in sinus.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.288
- We did it.
- Yeah.

28:10.504 --> 28:12.199
Couldn't have got through this without you.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.246
Let's close him up.

28:13.279 --> 28:14.462
Okay. Let's do it.

28:15.584 --> 28:17.274
Joey: I checked Laura's medical records.

28:17.297 --> 28:19.756
She never got screened,
knowing that she could have

28:19.756 --> 28:21.974
a ticking time bomb in her
brain just like her dad.

28:22.765 --> 28:24.427
It doesn't mean it's inevitable.

28:25.167 --> 28:26.542
Your mom's cancer.

28:26.548 --> 28:28.893
You take the BRCA test
that we talked about,

28:28.927 --> 28:30.717
see if you have the gene?

28:30.751 --> 28:32.221
Actually, I did.

28:32.256 --> 28:35.165
I'm just... waiting for the results.

28:35.436 --> 28:37.066
That took guts.

28:37.791 --> 28:39.884
Scary to face our future.

28:39.902 --> 28:41.437
[Scoffs]

28:41.471 --> 28:43.803
But if you can keep yourself
from regretting something,

28:43.804 --> 28:46.077
then you should do it, right?

28:46.427 --> 28:47.737
Most definitely.

28:47.761 --> 28:49.230
Gwen: So, I talked to my guy.

28:49.247 --> 28:50.781
Your stalker got paroled last week.

28:50.988 --> 28:51.626
What?

28:51.669 --> 28:52.544
Yeah.

28:52.581 --> 28:54.689
He had eight more years.

28:54.719 --> 28:55.875
Made a deal.

28:55.876 --> 28:57.055
But the DOC wants your help.

28:57.062 --> 28:59.613
They can revoke his parole
for harassing you, lock him up.

28:59.647 --> 29:00.670
Yeah, okay.

29:00.688 --> 29:02.525
[Sighs]

29:02.559 --> 29:03.884
I have to tell TC.

29:03.885 --> 29:05.725
Wait. I thought he was a new man.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.198
He is.

29:07.222 --> 29:09.085
- [Sighs]
- And we are. Look, it's j...

29:09.086 --> 29:11.735
There's some things that he's still working
through, and if I tell him about this...

29:11.747 --> 29:13.309
I don't understand, Jordan.

29:13.343 --> 29:14.557
What are you so afraid of?

29:14.903 --> 29:15.933
Nothing.

29:15.942 --> 29:18.765
Look, Gwen, this isn't
like what happened to you.

29:20.256 --> 29:23.299
I'm... Gwen, I'm sorry. I
didn't... I didn't mean it that way.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.098
- Figure it out and let me know.
- I'm sor...

29:27.519 --> 29:28.638
Damn it.

29:29.093 --> 29:31.665
[Monitor beeping]

29:31.702 --> 29:33.751
Thank you.

[Cellphone beeps]

29:39.799 --> 29:41.387
Hey, Annie.

29:41.902 --> 29:43.833
I thought you wanted to crash.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.600
You're where?

29:45.624 --> 29:47.126
Yeah, okay.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.160
[Cellphone beeps]

29:50.201 --> 29:51.542
TC: I need your help with Annie.

29:51.576 --> 29:53.046
Oh, the sister-in-law.

29:53.081 --> 29:54.358
She's Thad's wife.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.311
She seems like a hot mess.

29:56.344 --> 29:59.222
Yeah, well, she hasn't
been the same since he died.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.559
I can tell she and Jordan
aren't exactly kindred spirits?

30:01.592 --> 30:03.062
You could say they have a history.

30:03.096 --> 30:05.078
That's a catfight I don't want a part of.

30:05.112 --> 30:07.479
- Well, good luck with that.
- Yeah.

30:08.664 --> 30:09.814
[Clears throat]

30:09.848 --> 30:10.870
Hey.

30:10.904 --> 30:12.438
I'm gonna... Go.

30:12.472 --> 30:13.361
You're leaving?

30:13.390 --> 30:15.968
Yeah, I feel like crap. I
just want to crash at my place.

30:16.004 --> 30:17.713
You want me to come by
later with some soup?

30:17.737 --> 30:21.175
No, I need to sleep, but
I'll check in with you later.

30:21.771 --> 30:22.771
Yeah.

30:25.176 --> 30:28.406
Did you, um, did you want to
talk to me about something?

30:28.440 --> 30:30.294
Uh... It can wait.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.904
- Get some rest.
- Okay

30:54.712 --> 30:56.126
[Cellphone vibrates]

[Cellphone Beeps]

[Horn honks]

31:07.705 --> 31:08.854
Whoa.

31:08.888 --> 31:10.209
- Scott, I...
- Jordan, are you okay?

31:10.233 --> 31:12.534
No, I-I... I have a patient.

31:12.568 --> 31:14.270
He's been stalking me,
and I don't know, w...

31:14.276 --> 31:15.976
Well, come on. Let's get in the
car and we'll call the police.

31:15.993 --> 31:17.528
- But what if...
- Jordan, come on. I'm not asking.

31:17.529 --> 31:19.392
Let's go. I'll just cancel my meeting.

31:24.376 --> 31:27.574
Yeah, this is Dr. Scott
Clemmens at San Antonio Memorial.

31:27.596 --> 31:30.111
I need to talk to the police right away.

31:35.830 --> 31:39.402
**

31:39.427 --> 31:40.226
[Sighs]

31:40.260 --> 31:41.762
Thought you needed to crash.

31:43.908 --> 31:47.893
I needed a nightcap, and
there's no booze at your house.

31:47.911 --> 31:48.802
Okay.

31:48.836 --> 31:52.543
Barkeep, uh, two of your
finest Irish whiskeys.

31:53.619 --> 31:54.619
[Sighs]

31:55.812 --> 31:57.885
I'm okay. Thanks.

31:58.852 --> 32:02.530
- TC Callahan refusing Irish whiskey?
- Mm-hmm.

32:02.564 --> 32:04.258
It's the end of days.

32:04.292 --> 32:05.986
Why are you here, Annie?

32:07.107 --> 32:09.807
I couldn't stay in your place anymore, Tee.

32:10.820 --> 32:12.353
Thad's everywhere.

32:12.388 --> 32:15.074
It got me so damn depressed.

32:15.108 --> 32:17.361
Yeah. Okay. I-I get that.

32:18.416 --> 32:19.530
I've been there.

32:20.132 --> 32:22.559
I'm starting over.

32:22.969 --> 32:27.906
But I wanted to finally say
goodbye first, you and me.

32:27.940 --> 32:30.530
Just give him a proper
send-off. One last wake.

32:30.564 --> 32:33.236
I don't need to get wasted
anymore to celebrate my brother.

32:33.242 --> 32:36.001
No, but it'd be a lot more fun.

32:36.036 --> 32:36.599
[Chuckles]

32:36.749 --> 32:37.580
Ragosa: Big man on campus.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.152
[Laughs] Look at the kid.

32:39.321 --> 32:41.771
Yo, Toph, yo, you should have seen
that boy flying solo on that code.

32:41.772 --> 32:43.810
I know. I know. He's really stepping up.

32:43.816 --> 32:45.804
- Mm-hm.
- Paul. Excuse us, gentlemen.

32:46.957 --> 32:49.323
I got, uh, Oren's last test.

32:50.830 --> 32:51.830
Okay.

32:55.662 --> 32:57.003
Are you serious?

32:57.693 --> 32:58.732
I'm sorry.

33:00.633 --> 33:04.541
- W...
- You have two weeks, maybe... maybe three.

33:06.088 --> 33:09.990
T-there's the possibility of a bone
marrow transplant, but it's a Hail Mary.

33:10.030 --> 33:13.036
What about Alaska? Can
I still go to Alaska?

33:13.069 --> 33:15.180
You'll be too weak.

33:15.214 --> 33:16.492
Come on.

33:16.526 --> 33:19.564
But we can... we can
make you comfortable here.

33:19.597 --> 33:22.764
No. No. I want to go to my
dad's house. I want to...

33:22.798 --> 33:25.644
Can't stay here.

33:25.678 --> 33:28.140
Oren, um...

33:28.174 --> 33:29.964
You're still contaminated.

33:29.982 --> 33:32.012
I know, but...

33:32.046 --> 33:35.116
You'll expose your dad to radiation,

33:35.149 --> 33:39.515
poison his house by brushing
your teeth, using the toilet.

33:41.677 --> 33:44.113
I-it's... it's better
if you stay here, okay?

33:44.126 --> 33:45.324
Okay.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.308
It's best if I stay here.

33:48.258 --> 33:52.748
I'm... I'm so sor... I'm so sorry... Oren.

33:52.781 --> 33:58.124
I got that job so that
I could go on the trip.

33:58.158 --> 34:02.316
And now I can't even go on
the trip because of the job.

34:02.350 --> 34:03.820
[Voice breaking] I...

34:03.853 --> 34:08.972
I feel like... somebody stole my life.

34:13.261 --> 34:17.676
Will... Will you still take care of me?

34:19.246 --> 34:20.732
Every day.

34:22.253 --> 34:23.340
If you'll let me.

34:24.818 --> 34:27.509
Yeah, I just don't want...

34:27.581 --> 34:31.569
I just don't want to do it alone, you know?

34:35.232 --> 34:36.034
Can I...

34:36.034 --> 34:40.244
[Sobbing]

34:44.819 --> 34:47.340
- What's-her-name know you're here?
- What's-her-name does not.

34:47.638 --> 34:49.172
I can't believe you're still with her.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.867
Why does Jordan bug you so much?

34:50.868 --> 34:52.420
She thinks she's better than me.

34:52.427 --> 34:55.116
Nah. I don't think she thinks that at all.

34:55.149 --> 34:57.292
You're blind when it comes to her.

34:57.326 --> 34:59.001
She's not family.

34:59.427 --> 35:03.148
Oh. I almost forgot. I want to show you.

35:03.181 --> 35:06.059
I got your mom's videos
transferred to digital.

35:06.957 --> 35:09.356
[Chuckles] Pony football.

35:10.264 --> 35:12.739
Thad hit three touchdowns that game.

35:12.740 --> 35:14.498
Your brother was on our team.

35:14.499 --> 35:15.970
Greg.

35:16.036 --> 35:18.891
Thad and I had a bet who
could talk to you first,

35:18.926 --> 35:20.236
and he hid my bike.

35:20.270 --> 35:21.900
[Clears throat]

35:21.927 --> 35:24.284
And he beat me to it that day.

35:25.486 --> 35:27.507
What if <i>you'd</i> won the bet?

35:36.292 --> 35:37.388
[Cellphone beeps]

35:37.421 --> 35:39.884
He must be sleeping, 'cause
he's still not answering.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.313
Well, then I'm staying.

35:41.385 --> 35:44.778
No. No, Scott, I'm... I'm
fine. You can go. It's okay.

35:44.809 --> 35:49.333
Jordan. I saw your
face. You were terrified.

35:50.242 --> 35:52.556
Come on. You don't have to put on a front.

35:53.140 --> 35:54.194
I'm not TC.

35:55.342 --> 35:56.908
What does that mean?

35:57.852 --> 35:59.442
You know what that means.

36:00.130 --> 36:01.996
You're scared.

36:02.838 --> 36:04.180
That's normal.

36:04.494 --> 36:06.796
I still can't believe they let him out.

36:06.829 --> 36:11.627
Well, now they'll put him right
back in... For good this time.

36:11.662 --> 36:14.059
Thank you for being here, Scott.

36:14.094 --> 36:17.454
Any time you have an insane
stalker, I'm your guy.

36:18.827 --> 36:21.676
Anyway, you should get some rest.

36:21.890 --> 36:23.527
Yeah.

36:24.371 --> 36:28.441
You have the exposure of 30 X-rays, so
take the prussian blue pills for a month

36:28.471 --> 36:29.484
to be safe.

36:29.517 --> 36:31.614
And take a few days off, too.

36:31.615 --> 36:33.622
Yeah, I'm... I'm okay, actually.

36:33.652 --> 36:35.660
Um, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow?

36:35.884 --> 36:37.323
Okay.

36:38.381 --> 36:39.819
You did good, Paul.

36:39.854 --> 36:42.284
You didn't think. You <i>acted.</i>

36:42.317 --> 36:44.652
That's the first step
to being a real doctor.

36:54.381 --> 36:56.547
Hey. I was just about to leave you a note.

36:56.571 --> 36:59.557
That's... that's perfect timing.
I was... was looking for you.

36:59.581 --> 37:02.240
I wanted to give you my going-away gift.

37:03.557 --> 37:05.044
Wow. Thanks.

37:05.582 --> 37:06.901
Sure.

37:06.902 --> 37:09.000
* Can't be found. Can't be found. *

37:09.006 --> 37:10.978
[Laughs]

37:12.365 --> 37:15.178
- Very stylish. Perfection, right?
- Yeah. It's good.

37:15.212 --> 37:16.330
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

37:17.271 --> 37:20.932
I just... I figured if I got
stationed somewhere tropical, and...

37:21.717 --> 37:24.714
Well, you wanted to visit,
you know, you'd be set.

37:24.715 --> 37:26.457
* I can see *

37:27.466 --> 37:28.680
So, that's an invitation?

37:28.681 --> 37:31.207
Yes. It is.

37:32.004 --> 37:36.006
You know, the shift is over,
and I'm not your boss anymore.

37:36.007 --> 37:37.126
So I can say what I want.

37:37.612 --> 37:39.530
Which is?

37:44.106 --> 37:48.008
* Grace falls down on quiet hearts *

37:52.791 --> 37:54.517
* You don't have to yell *

37:54.518 --> 37:58.324
* Don't have to yell *

37:58.636 --> 38:00.565
Come on, Kenny. [Pats back]

38:15.861 --> 38:18.227
Hey, Dad.

38:18.261 --> 38:19.795
Yeah, it's, um...

38:19.829 --> 38:21.747
Yeah, not so good, actually.

38:21.781 --> 38:23.671
Um...

38:25.237 --> 38:27.827
Yeah, do you have a minute to talk?

38:27.861 --> 38:30.131
* I will rise *

38:30.132 --> 38:33.137
* I'll follow your eyes and *

38:33.205 --> 38:37.503
* Grace falls down on quiet hearts *

38:41.589 --> 38:46.644
* Just when you think
you might fall apart *

38:46.677 --> 38:49.680
TC: The Stingray. I loved that bike.

38:49.681 --> 38:52.339
Had the three-speed shifter on the frame.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.451
He'd never let me ride it.

38:54.485 --> 38:56.282
I bet he'd let you ride it now.

38:58.005 --> 38:59.571
Let's go back to your place.

38:59.605 --> 39:02.075
I'll make my famous Bloody Marys.

39:02.099 --> 39:03.827
I'll get the tab.

39:07.093 --> 39:08.336
Jordan called.

39:08.349 --> 39:09.349
Of course she did.

39:09.873 --> 39:11.535
I better call her back.

39:11.536 --> 39:14.094
I'm gonna hit the ladies'. Watch my purse.

39:16.821 --> 39:21.176

TC: Hey, uh, saw you called.

39:38.851 --> 39:42.707
Um, sorry. You must be
sleeping, so sleep well.

39:42.741 --> 39:44.307
* Don't have to yell *

39:44.341 --> 39:47.475
Could you, uh, take care of Annie's purse?

39:47.509 --> 39:50.003
I got to get some air.

39:50.037 --> 39:52.563
* You don't have to yell *
