- (SIREN WAILS)
- Can't we shut that ruddy thing up?!

00:04.240 --> 00:07.239
- If wishes were kisses...
- 92 advancing from Biggin Hill.

00:07.320 --> 00:10.479
- Hostile 36, confirm, please.
- Able Victor Charlie down.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.399
26 and 41 detailed to intercept.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.479
41 ?

00:14.280 --> 00:16.959
- (BOMB CRUMPS)
- That's... That's Reg's squadron.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.599
- Sir.
- How many?

00:21.640 --> 00:24.399
Looks like a dozen Heinkel at least, sir,
with Messerschmitts flanking.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.679
- Out of range?
- Normally, sir, yes.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.239
Well, then.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.319
Time to roll out the secret weapon!

01:17.360 --> 01:19.639
(METALLIC THRUMMING)

01:26.320 --> 01:28.959
(BUZZER SOUNDS TWICE)

01:36.240 --> 01:38.039
THE DOCTOR: Amy...

01:38.120 --> 01:39.599
Winston Churchill.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.639
Doctor?

01:41.720 --> 01:46.359
- Is it you?
- Oh, Winston, my old friend!

01:47.720 --> 01:50.639
- Ah, every time!
- What's he after?

01:50.720 --> 01:52.159
TARDIS key, of course.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.399
Think of what I could achieve
with your remarkable machine, Doctor!

01:56.480 --> 02:00.239
- The lives that could be saved!
- Ah, doesn't work like that.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.919
Must I take it by force?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.679
I'd like to see you try.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.639
At ease.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.319
You rang?

02:09.400 --> 02:12.199
- (PHONE RINGS)
- So you've changed your face again.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.439
Yeah, well, had a bit of work done.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.799
Got it, got it, got it!
Cabinet War Rooms, right?

02:17.920 --> 02:21.319
Yep. Top-secret heart of the War Office,
right under London.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.519
You're late, by the way.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.959
- Requisitions, sir.
- Excellent.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.679
- Late?
- I rang you a month ago.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.999
Really? Sorry.
Sorry, it's a Type 40 TARDIS.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.319
- I'm just running her in.
- (PHONE RINGS)

02:34.920 --> 02:36.919
Something the matter, Breen?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.679
- You look a little down in the dumps.
- No, sir. Fine, sir.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.519
Action this day, Breen!
Action this day!

02:43.600 --> 02:46.359
- Yes, sir.
- (PHONE RINGS)

02:47.680 --> 02:51.159
Excuse me, sir. Got another formation
coming in, Prime Minister.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.479
- Stukas, by the look of them.
- We shall go up top, then, Group Captain.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.399
We'll give 'em what for!

02:55.480 --> 02:57.519
- Coming, Doctor?
- Why?

02:57.600 --> 03:00.839
I have something to show you.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.119
(LAUGHS)

03:11.240 --> 03:13.799
We stand at a crossroads, Doctor,

03:13.880 --> 03:17.159
quite alone, with our backs to the wall.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.999
Invasion is expected daily.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.879
So I will grasp with both hands

03:22.960 --> 03:27.839
anything that will give us an advantage
over the Nazi menace.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.799
Such as?

03:33.720 --> 03:35.479
Follow me.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.919
AMY: Wow!

03:38.000 --> 03:39.519
My God!

03:39.560 --> 03:45.159
Doctor, this is Professor Edwin Bracewell,
head of our Ironsides Project.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.199
How d'you do?

03:48.400 --> 03:51.759
MAN: Two-five Ju 88s
approaching from the east.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.359

03:55.080 --> 03:56.679
(EXPLOSION)

04:01.280 --> 04:03.839
AMY: It's... It's...

04:03.920 --> 04:05.959
Oh, Doctor...

04:06.040 --> 04:07.879
Doctor, it's...

04:09.280 --> 04:10.559
History.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.119
- Ready, Bracewell?
- Aye-aye, sir.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.399
On my order...fire!

04:21.480 --> 04:22.559
What was that?!

04:23.720 --> 04:28.759
That wasn't human - that was never
human technology. That sounded like...

04:28.840 --> 04:30.919
Show me. Show me!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.479
Show me what that was!

04:33.440 --> 04:38.239
- Advance!
- Our new secret weapon! Hah!

04:44.160 --> 04:47.199
What do you think?
Quite something, eh?

04:47.280 --> 04:49.079
What are you doing here?

04:49.160 --> 04:53.719
- I am your soldier.
- What?

04:53.800 --> 04:55.639
- I am your soldier.
- Stop this.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.359
You stop now!

04:58.400 --> 05:00.639
Oh, you know who I am.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.319
You always know.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.919
Your identity is unknown.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.319
Perhaps I can clarify things here.
This... This is one of my Ironsides.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.479
Your what?

05:11.560 --> 05:15.199
You will help the Allied cause
in any way that you can?

05:15.280 --> 05:16.559
Yes.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.239
Until the Germans
have been utterly smashed?

05:19.320 --> 05:20.519
Yes.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.399
And what is your ultimate aim?

05:22.480 --> 05:24.879
To win...the war!

05:27.440 --> 05:30.519
They're Daleks!
They're called Daleks!

05:30.600 --> 05:33.559
They are Bracewell's Ironsides, Doctor!
Look!

05:33.640 --> 05:37.639
Blueprints, statistics, field tests,
photographs. He invented them!

05:37.720 --> 05:41.399
Invented them? Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, no. No!

05:41.520 --> 05:44.679
Yes! He approached one of our brass hats
a few months ago.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.799
- Fella's a genius.
- A Scottish genius, too.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.919
- Maybe you should listen to...
- Shh!

05:52.800 --> 05:54.719
He didn't invent them.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.039
They're alien.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.599
Alien?

06:06.640 --> 06:07.919
And totally hostile.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.119
Precisely. They will win me the war.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.679
Why won't you listen to me? Why did you
call me in if you won't listen to me?

06:18.760 --> 06:23.239
When I rang you a month ago,
I must admit, I had my doubts.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.639
The Ironsides seemed too good to be true.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.439
Yes! Right! So destroy them!
Exterminate them!

06:28.520 --> 06:31.759
But imagine what I could do
with a hundred. A thousand!

06:31.840 --> 06:33.239
I am imagining.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.639
Amy, tell him.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.799
- Tell him what?
- About the Daleks.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.399
What would I know about the Daleks?

06:45.480 --> 06:47.439
Everything. They invaded your world,
remember?

06:47.520 --> 06:50.279
Planets in the sky,
you don't forget that.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.239
Amy...

06:54.680 --> 06:57.319
Tell me you remember the Daleks.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.719
No, sorry!

07:00.720 --> 07:02.919
That's not possible.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.319
- (BOMB CRUMPS)
- Blue Leader to Two Squadron...

07:10.400 --> 07:13.159
- And 6...
- 2 357, over!

07:13.240 --> 07:15.559
2 357, over!

07:15.640 --> 07:19.159
So they're up to something.
But what is it?

07:19.240 --> 07:20.679
What are they after?

07:20.760 --> 07:22.679
Well, let's just ask, shall we?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.359
Amy... Amelia!

07:27.360 --> 07:29.839
Can I be of assistance?

07:30.840 --> 07:32.199
Oh. Yes. Yes!

07:32.280 --> 07:35.359
See, erm, my friend reckons
you're dangerous.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.639
That you're an alien. Is it true?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.799
I am your soldier.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.439
Yeah. Got that bit. Love a squaddie.
What else, though?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.359
Please excuse me.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.999
I have duties to perform.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.599
Winston, Winston, please.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.279
We are waging total war, Doctor!

07:54.360 --> 07:58.119
Day after day, the Luftwaffe pound
this great city like an iron fist.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.799
- Wait till the Daleks get started.
- Men, women and children slaughtered.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.359
Families torn apart.
Wren's churches in flame.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.599
Yeah, try the Earth in flames!

08:06.680 --> 08:10.839
I weep for my country,
I weep for my empire.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.439
It is breaking my heart.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.519
But you're resisting, Winston.
The whole world knows you're resisting.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.959
You're a beacon of hope.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.319
But for how long?

08:19.400 --> 08:25.799
Millions of innocent lives will be saved
if I use these Ironsides now!

08:25.880 --> 08:27.559
Can I be of assistance?

08:27.640 --> 08:30.639
Shut it! Listen to me. Just listen!

08:30.720 --> 08:32.759
The Daleks have no conscience.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.359
No mercy. No... No pity.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.279
They are my oldest
and deadliest enemy.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.839
You cannot trust them.

08:41.920 --> 08:46.999
If Hitler invaded hell, I would give
a favourable reference to the Devil.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.239
These machines are our salvation!

08:50.320 --> 08:53.719
- (SIREN)
- Oh... (SIGHS) The all-clear.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.879
We are safe. For now.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.839
AMY: Doctor, it's the all-clear.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.359
Are you OK?

09:12.440 --> 09:15.319
What does hate look like, Amy?

09:15.400 --> 09:16.679
Hate?

09:16.760 --> 09:19.079
Mm. It looks like a Dalek.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.799
And I'm going to prove it.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.639
Would you care for some tea?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.679
That would be very nice. Thank you.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.039
All right, Prof?
Now, the PM's been filling me in.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.759
Amazing things,
these Ironsides of yours. Amazing.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.399
You must be very proud of them.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.159
Just doing my bit.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.359
Hmm, not bad for a Paisley boy.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.319
Oh! (LAUGHS) Yes, I... Yes, I thought
I detected a familiar cadence, my dear.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.959
How did you do it, come up with the idea?

09:58.040 --> 10:00.039
Well, how does the muse
of invention come to anyone?

10:00.120 --> 10:03.239
But you get a lot of these
clever notions, do you?

10:03.320 --> 10:06.639
Well, ideas just seem
to teem from my head!

10:06.720 --> 10:09.119
Wonderful things!
Like... Let me show you.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.199
You see, some musings on the potential
of hypersonic flight.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.239
Gravity bubbles that can sustain life
outside of the terrestrial atmosphere!

10:17.320 --> 10:20.119
- Came to me in the bath!
- And are these your ideas or theirs?

10:20.200 --> 10:23.359
Oh, no, no, no, no. These robots
are entirely under my control, Doctor.

10:23.440 --> 10:28.759
They are - thank you - the perfect
servant, and the perfect warrior.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.559
I don't know what you're up to, Professor,

10:30.640 --> 10:33.159
but whatever they've promised you,
you cannot trust them.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.719
Call them what you like,
the Daleks are death!

10:35.800 --> 10:38.719
Yes, Doctor. Death to our enemies!

10:38.800 --> 10:43.319
Death to the forces of darkness,
and death to the Third Reich!

10:43.400 --> 10:46.519
Yes, Winston,
and death to everyone else too.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.559
Would you care for some tea?

10:49.600 --> 10:52.839
Stop this! What are you doing here?
What do you want?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.159
We seek only to help you.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.119
- To do what?
- To win the war.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.799
Really? Which war?

11:00.880 --> 11:03.079
I do not understand.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.919
This war, against the Nazis,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.039
or your war, the war against
the rest of the universe,

11:07.120 --> 11:10.519
the war against all life-forms
that are not Dalek?

11:12.800 --> 11:16.159
I do not understand.
I am your soldier.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.519
Oh, yeah? OK.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.199
OK!

11:20.800 --> 11:23.799
OK, soldier, defend yourself!

11:23.880 --> 11:25.799
But... What...

11:25.880 --> 11:28.359
- BRACEWELL: What the devil?!
- You do not require tea?

11:28.440 --> 11:30.359
Stop him! Prime Minister, please!

11:30.440 --> 11:33.879
Doctor, what the devil?
These machines are precious!

11:33.960 --> 11:35.319
Come on!

11:35.400 --> 11:37.839
Fight back! You want to, don't you?

11:37.920 --> 11:39.879
- You know you do!
- I must protest!

11:39.960 --> 11:43.799
What are you waiting for? Look.
You hate me. You want to kill me.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.719
Well, go on! Kill me.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.759
- Kill me!
- Doctor, be careful!

11:48.840 --> 11:51.159
Please desist from striking me.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.719
I am your soldier.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.879
You...are...my...enemy!

11:55.960 --> 11:57.399
And I am yours!

11:58.440 --> 12:00.799
You are everything I despise.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.119
The worst thing in all creation.

12:03.240 --> 12:07.119
I've defeated you,
time and time again I've defeated you.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.839
I sent you back into the void.
I saved the whole of reality from you!

12:11.920 --> 12:13.999
I am the Doctor.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.959
And you are the Daleks!

12:26.960 --> 12:28.759
Correct.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.839
Review testimony.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.599
DOCTOR'S VOICE: Iam the Doctor.
And you are the Daleks!

12:37.680 --> 12:40.959
Testimony? What are you
talking about, testimony?

12:41.040 --> 12:42.959
Transmitting testimony now.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.839
Transmit what, where?

12:53.080 --> 12:56.279
Receiving testimony now.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.719
I am the Doctor.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.039
And you are the Daleks!

13:01.120 --> 13:04.319
Progenitor activated.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.559
Testimony accepted!
Testimony accepted!

13:09.600 --> 13:11.679
Testimony accepted!

13:11.760 --> 13:14.919
- Get back, all of you.
- Marines! Marines! Get in here!

13:19.520 --> 13:22.359
Stop it! Stop it, please!
What are you doing?!

13:22.440 --> 13:24.919
You are my Ironsides!

13:25.000 --> 13:27.559
We are the Daleks.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.679
- But I created you!
- No.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.159
We created you!

13:48.920 --> 13:50.519
What just happened, Doctor?

13:51.560 --> 13:53.919
I wanted to know what they wanted.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.759
What their plan was.

14:26.760 --> 14:30.759
- That's what they said! My testimony.
- Don't beat yourself up, you were right.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.399
Is this what we do now? Chase after them?

14:32.480 --> 14:35.199
This is what I do, yeah,
and it's dangerous, so you wait here.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.519
What, so you mean I've got to
stay safe down here,

14:37.600 --> 14:39.279

We can't get a proper fix, though.
It's too far up.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.119
What do you think, Miss Pond?

15:30.200 --> 15:32.959
The Doctor's in trouble
and now we know where he is.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.399
Yep. Cos he'll be on that ship, won't he?

15:35.480 --> 15:38.239

One of the Progenitor devices.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.599
Progenitor? What's that when it's at home?

16:55.680 --> 16:58.919
It is our past. And our future!

16:59.000 --> 17:02.599
Ohh, that's deep.
That is deep for a Dalek.

17:02.680 --> 17:06.159
- What does it mean, though?
- It contains pure Dalek DNA.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.479
Thousands were created.
All were lost, save one.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.999
OK, but there's still one thing
I don't get, though -

17:13.080 --> 17:15.599
if you've got the Progenitor,
why build Bracewell?

17:15.680 --> 17:18.159
It was...necessary.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.039
But why?

17:21.920 --> 17:23.279
I get it.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.359
Oh, I get it, I get it!

17:25.440 --> 17:27.399
Oh-ho! This is rich!

17:27.520 --> 17:30.639
The Progenitor wouldn't recognise you,
would it? It saw you as impure.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.959
Your DNA is unrecognisable as Dalek.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.799
A solution was devised.

Yes, yes, yes. Me. My testimony.
So you set a trap.

You knew that the Progenitor would
recognise me, the Daleks' greatest enemy.

to Danny Boy. Destroy this ship! Over.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.479
What about you, Doctor?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.559
I'll be OK.

27:44.560 --> 27:48.279
Doctor! Call off your attack!

27:48.360 --> 27:53.159
Ha-ha! What? And let you scuttle off
back to the future? No fear.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.119
This is the end for you.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.279
The final end!

27:57.360 --> 28:02.479
Call off the attack,
or we will destroy the Earth!

28:02.560 --> 28:05.199
I'm not stupid, mate.
You've just played your last card.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.359
Bracewell is a bomb.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.439
You're bluffing.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.319
Deception's second nature to you.
There isn't a sincere bone in your body.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.159
There isn't a bone in your...body.

28:17.240 --> 28:22.519
His power is derived
from an Oblivion Continuum!

28:22.600 --> 28:28.239
Call off your attack,
or we will detonate the android!

28:28.320 --> 28:31.399
Er, no. This is my best chance ever.
The last of the Daleks.

28:31.480 --> 28:35.479
I can rid the whole universe
of you, once...and for all.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.239
Then, do it.

28:37.320 --> 28:40.839
But we will shatter the planet below!

28:40.920 --> 28:44.999
The Earth will die, screaming!

28:45.080 --> 28:49.839
And if I let you go...
you'll be stronger than ever.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.919
A new race of Daleks.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.839
Then, choose, Doctor.

28:56.920 --> 29:01.719
Destroy the Daleks or save the Earth.

29:01.800 --> 29:06.159
Begin countdown of Oblivion Continuum!

29:06.240 --> 29:08.279
Choose, Doctor!

29:08.360 --> 29:11.799
Choose! Choose!

29:19.800 --> 29:23.199
The Doctor to Danny Boy.
The Doctor to Danny Boy. Withdraw.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.919
Say again, sir. Over.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.279
Withdraw! Return to Earth. Over and out.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.439
But sir...!

29:28.520 --> 29:30.799
There's no time,
we have to return to Earth now! Over.

His compassion is his greatest weakness.

Daleks have no such weakness.

30:01.480 --> 30:03.199
Doctor!

30:03.320 --> 30:06.759
Owww! Sorry, Professor. You're a bomb.
An inconceivably massive Dalek bomb.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.719
What?!

30:08.800 --> 30:10.559
There's an Oblivion Continuum inside you,

30:10.640 --> 30:13.039
a captured wormhole
that provides perpetual power.

30:13.160 --> 30:16.439
Detonate that, and the Earth will
bleed through into another dimension!

Never seen one up close before.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.999
So, what, they've wired him up
to detonate?

30:37.080 --> 30:40.039
No, not wired him up. He is a bomb.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.159
There's...a blue wire or something
you have to cut, isn't there?

30:44.240 --> 30:46.879
There's always a blue wire.
Or a red one.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.279
You're not helping.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.239
It's incredible. He talked to us
about his memories. The Great War...

Someone else's stolen thoughts,
implanted in a positronic brain.

30:55.560 --> 30:58.559
Tell me about it, Bracewell.
Tell me about your life.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.559
Doctor, I really don't think
this is the time.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.799
Tell me, and prove you're human.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.239
Tell me everything.

Countdown proceeding.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.879
My family ran the...the post office.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.359
It's a little place just...
just near the abbey.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.399
Just by the ash trees. Used to be
eight trees, but there was a storm.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.839
And your parents? Come on. Tell me.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.959
Er...good people. Kind people.

31:22.040 --> 31:25.759
- They... They died. Scarlet fever.
- What was that like? How did it feel?

31:25.840 --> 31:27.159
Oh, please...

31:27.240 --> 31:30.279
How did it make you feel, Edwin?
Tell me. Tell me now.

31:30.360 --> 31:34.159
Oh, it hurt. It hurt, Doctor,
it hurt so badly.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.639
It was like a wound.

31:37.720 --> 31:41.199
I thought it was worse than a wound.
Like I'd been emptied out.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.559
There was nothing...

31:42.640 --> 31:44.439
Good. Remember it now, Edwin!

31:44.560 --> 31:46.919
The ash trees by the post office
and your mum and dad, and losing them,

31:47.040 --> 31:50.719
and the men in the trenches you saw die.
You feel it, because you're human.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.359
You're not like them.
You're not like the Daleks!

31:53.440 --> 31:56.199
It hurts, Doctor! It hurts so much!

31:56.320 --> 31:59.399
Good! Good! Good! Brilliant! Embrace it.
That means you're alive!

31:59.480 --> 32:02.319
They cannot explode that bomb,
because you're a human being!

32:02.400 --> 32:04.559
You are flesh and blood!

They cannot explode that bomb!
Believe it!

You are Professor Edwin Bracewell!
And you, my friend, are a human being!

32:28.080 --> 32:31.039
Ever fancied someone
you know you shouldn't?

32:31.120 --> 32:32.519
What?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.839
Hurts, doesn't it?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.039
But kind of a good hurt.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.079
I really shouldn't talk about her.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.959
Oh. There's a her.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.959
What was her name?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.359
Dorabella.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.519
Dorabella! (LAUGHS)

33:01.600 --> 33:05.119
- It's a lovely name, a beautiful name.
- What was she like, Edwin?

33:06.520 --> 33:08.399
Such a smile.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.359
And her eyes...

33:12.400 --> 33:14.039
Her eyes were so blue...

33:15.080 --> 33:16.599
Almost violet.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.479
Like the last touch of sunset...

33:54.560 --> 33:57.199
You're brilliant. And you, I...

33:58.400 --> 34:00.599
Now. Gotta stop them! Stop the Daleks!

34:00.680 --> 34:02.759
Wait! Doctor! Wait... Wait.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.479
It's too late.

34:07.520 --> 34:12.439
You will never defeat us, Doctor.
We will return.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.479
ALL: We will return!

34:16.520 --> 34:17.759
Gone.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.239
They've gone.

34:19.280 --> 34:24.519
No, noooo! They can't!
They can't have got away from me again!

34:24.600 --> 34:26.999
No, I can feel it.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.839
My mind is clear.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.839
The Daleks have gone.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.439
Doctor, it's OK! You did it.
You stopped the bomb.

34:44.520 --> 34:46.439
Doctor?

34:46.520 --> 34:49.879
I had a choice.
And they knew I'd choose the Earth.

34:51.720 --> 34:54.439
The Daleks...have won.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.159
They beat me, they've won.

34:56.240 --> 35:00.359
But you saved the Earth.
Not too shabby, is it?

35:05.880 --> 35:06.999
Is it?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.239
No.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.959
It's not too shabby.

35:11.040 --> 35:16.559
It's a brilliant achievement,
my dear friend. Here, have a cigar!

No...

35:37.600 --> 35:39.799
So, what now, then?

- Prime Minister...
- Oh, thank you.

35:46.280 --> 35:49.119
Oh... They hit the Palace
and St Paul's again.

- Fire crews only just saved it.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.119
- Is she OK?
- What?

win me the war in 24 hours!

Why can't we put an end
to all this misery?

It's gonna be tough.

I've been expecting you, Doctor.

I knew this moment had to come.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.439
Moment?

37:46.520 --> 37:49.479
It's time to de-activate me.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.199
Is it? Oh... Er...

37:53.480 --> 37:54.799
Yeah.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.919
You have no choice.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.919
I'm Dalek technology.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.319
Can't allow me to go pottering around
down here where I have no business.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.439
No, you're dead right, Professor.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.879
1 00% right. And by the time
I get back here in...

38:10.960 --> 38:13.559
- what, ten minutes?
- More like 1 5.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.479
1 5 minutes, yeah, that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.599
You are going to be so de-activated.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.039
It's going be like you've never
even been...activated.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.519
Yeah!

- Yes.
- ...the urgent thing we've got to see to.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.359
The... The... See?

38:31.440 --> 38:32.999
Very well, Doctor.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.999
I shall wait here and...prepare myself.

38:36.080 --> 38:39.359
(Yeah, Dalek tech,
but a bit slow on the uptake.)

38:39.480 --> 38:42.359
That thing we have to do, gonna take half
an hour, realistically, isn't it, Doctor?

38:42.440 --> 38:45.599
Easily! So no running off,
that's what I'm saying.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.919
Don't go trying to find that little
post office with the ash trees

38:49.000 --> 38:51.359
or...or that girl.
What was her name?

38:51.440 --> 38:53.319
- Dorabella.
- Dorabella.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.239
On no account go looking for her.

38:56.280 --> 38:59.439
Mind you, you can get a lot done
in half an hour.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.839
Thank you! Thank you, Doctor!

(LAUGHS)

39:11.200 --> 39:13.079
Come along, Pond.

39:22.120 --> 39:26.119
- So, you have enemies, then?
- Everyone's got enemies.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.999
Yeah, but mine's the woman outside Budgens
with the mental Jack Russell.

39:29.080 --> 39:32.359
You've got, like, you know,
arch...enemies.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.199
Suppose so.

39:36.400 --> 39:39.719
And here was me thinking
we'd just be...running through time,

39:39.800 --> 39:41.959
being daft and fixing stuff.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.199
But no. It's dangerous.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.199
Yup. Very.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.799
Is that a problem?

39:51.800 --> 39:53.799
I'm still here, aren't I?

39:56.600 --> 39:58.319
You're worried about the Daleks.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.639
I'm always worried about the Daleks.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.599
It'll take time, though, won't it?
I mean, there's still not many of them.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.319
They'll need a while
to build themselves up.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.599
It's not that.
There's something else.

40:09.680 --> 40:13.239
Something we've forgotten.
Or rather you have.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.479
- Me?
- You didn't know them, Amy.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.839
You'd never seen them before.
And you should have done.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.159
You should.
