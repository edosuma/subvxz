WEBVTT

00:23.232 --> 00:24.901
- I don't know anything!

00:25.651 --> 00:27.069
Mr. Harp!

00:27.528 --> 00:31.282
I swear,

00:27.528 --> 00:31.282
there ain't nothing more

00:27.528 --> 00:31.282
I could do for ya.

00:31.783 --> 00:33.200
(screaming)

00:31.783 --> 00:33.200
- Jesus, Declan!

00:33.284 --> 00:35.620
(Chaulk crying out)

00:33.284 --> 00:35.620
- C'mon! What did you do?!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.872
- Ah! Nothing!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.872
Nothing. I helped her.

00:37.956 --> 00:40.625
- No, you helped him!

00:37.956 --> 00:40.625
Where are they going?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.835
- Benton's taking her

00:40.708 --> 00:42.835
to Scotland.

00:42.919 --> 00:44.545
- That's the story she gave me.

00:44.629 --> 00:46.756
- You might want to let your

00:44.629 --> 00:46.756
blood cool down a little, Harp.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.549
- What's he planning?

00:46.839 --> 00:48.549
- Ah...

00:48.633 --> 00:50.760
- Speak, vile wench.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.760
(panting)

00:50.843 --> 00:52.720
- I don't know, I don't know.

00:52.804 --> 00:55.389
We escaped, me and Miss Emberly.

00:55.473 --> 00:57.141
We... we escaped,

00:57.224 --> 00:59.769
and then Benton caught us

00:57.224 --> 00:59.769
and I woke up in her clothes!

00:59.852 --> 01:03.397
- Sounds like you led her

00:59.852 --> 01:03.397
into a trap.

00:59.852 --> 01:03.397
Is that what you did?

01:03.481 --> 01:05.775
- No.

01:03.481 --> 01:05.775
- Is that what you did?

01:03.481 --> 01:05.775
- She had no part of it!

01:05.858 --> 01:09.612
- Bullshit!! I'm not convinced!

01:05.858 --> 01:09.612
- Well, I surely am!

01:05.858 --> 01:09.612
Look at the poor child.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.196
(grunting)

01:11.781 --> 01:15.660
Now I see two people wrecked

01:11.781 --> 01:15.660
by the same wicked devil.

01:11.781 --> 01:15.660
Now don't let him win!

01:17.328 --> 01:20.205
- If you don't plan

01:17.328 --> 01:20.205
on killing me, Charlie,

01:20.289 --> 01:22.000
then you get your hands off me.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.251
- I met a noble man once...

01:24.335 --> 01:26.086
who walked

01:24.335 --> 01:26.086
into a dangerous situation

01:26.170 --> 01:28.965
to help a stranger in

01:26.170 --> 01:28.965
his own terrible circumstance.

01:29.048 --> 01:31.342
And that man

01:29.048 --> 01:31.342
would've stopped at nothin'

01:31.425 --> 01:34.303
until he saw the injustice

01:31.425 --> 01:34.303
before him redressed.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.055
Nothing.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.058
Because it cannot stand, Harp.

01:41.352 --> 01:42.937
It can't.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.743
(McTaggart): The stones on you.

01:59.328 --> 02:02.206
You'd sink

01:59.328 --> 02:02.206
straight to the bottom

01:59.328 --> 02:02.206
with the weight of them balls.

02:03.082 --> 02:04.959
- Please just let me go.

02:05.043 --> 02:09.047
- Until I get to Grace,

02:05.043 --> 02:09.047
you're coming with me.

02:05.043 --> 02:09.047
We're going to Scotland.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.758
- Oh, get it up ya, Harp.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.260
I'm not going back to Scotland!

02:20.808 --> 02:21.976
Ah, shite.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.646
(theme music)

03:23.495 --> 03:26.206
- She's small,

03:23.495 --> 03:26.206
but she'll be fast.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.418
I spent a year

03:26.540 --> 03:29.418
learning to how sail

03:26.540 --> 03:29.418
on a gaff-rigged boat like that.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.588
- Now we're all gonna learn

03:29.501 --> 03:32.588
how to die on one.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.588
- Can we handle it?

03:32.671 --> 03:34.214
- I can sail that vessel, sir.

03:35.174 --> 03:38.094
- Alright, McTaggart,

03:35.174 --> 03:38.094
fast and quiet.

03:40.096 --> 03:41.388
Don't move.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.142
Charlie, you watch her.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.193
- Afternoon, gents.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.571
Inclement weather we're having,

03:55.611 --> 03:57.571
eh?

04:15.798 --> 04:17.008
(grunting)

04:22.346 --> 04:23.555
- Hello?

04:24.890 --> 04:26.475
Anybody home?

04:26.558 --> 04:29.854
- I hope there's enough cargo

04:26.558 --> 04:29.854
to sustain us.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.854
(rattling)

04:30.896 --> 04:33.732
- I hope Chaulk knows

04:30.896 --> 04:33.732
how to work this thing.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.485
- We're gonna need all our hands

04:33.816 --> 04:36.485
working all the time.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.779
- It's going to take

04:36.568 --> 04:38.779
more than that, mate!

04:39.905 --> 04:42.074
You are not the king's men.

04:42.158 --> 04:45.077
- No, we left them

04:42.158 --> 04:45.077
sleeping on the beach.

04:42.158 --> 04:45.077
- Hmm.

04:45.161 --> 04:49.999
Their comrades are not gonna

04:45.161 --> 04:49.999
be very pleased about that.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.542
- Who are you?

04:52.501 --> 04:54.336
- Who am I?

04:56.380 --> 05:00.009
I am the prince

04:56.380 --> 05:00.009
of the Crimson Sails,

05:00.092 --> 05:03.345
First Guard

05:00.092 --> 05:03.345
in the Order of Leça.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.724
I am Poseidon's right arm,

05:06.807 --> 05:09.560
master of the sea.

05:10.144 --> 05:14.065
Faithful lover

05:10.144 --> 05:14.065
to the one and only Madelena.

05:14.148 --> 05:17.442
I am God's favourite son.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.280
I am called Fortunato.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.535
I'm the<i> capitán</i> of this vessel.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.535
So who are you?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.495
- We're taking this ship

05:26.618 --> 05:28.495
and going to Scotland.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.874
- So you can shut your trap,

05:28.579 --> 05:31.874
silly days,

05:28.579 --> 05:31.874
or you're taking a dip.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.004
- Why are we not moving?

05:34.418 --> 05:37.004
You said you could handle this.

05:37.088 --> 05:41.425
- I can't seem to get the sail

05:37.088 --> 05:41.425
on the aft-mast unfurled.

05:37.088 --> 05:41.425
I've never seen rigging like it.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.385
- Because you're not

05:41.508 --> 05:43.385
<i>Português!</i>

05:44.344 --> 05:46.555
You need me to sail this ship.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.891
I know every curve,

05:48.974 --> 05:52.394
every crevice

05:48.974 --> 05:52.394
on this beautiful ship.

05:53.104 --> 05:57.399
I go nowhere without her,

05:53.104 --> 05:57.399
nor she without me.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.402
- You're gonna

05:57.983 --> 06:00.402
get this thing moving, Captain.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.198
(in Maori):

06:01.779 --> 06:04.198
-<i> Should I deal with them?</i>

06:01.779 --> 06:04.198
(exclamations)

06:04.282 --> 06:05.741
- Jesus Murphy!

06:05.824 --> 06:07.826
- It's fine, Te Rangi.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.247
I think this man can see reason.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.134
- What do you want in return

06:20.589 --> 06:23.134
for passage to Scotland -

06:23.217 --> 06:25.261
<i>and</i> your freedom

06:23.217 --> 06:25.261
from the HBC?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.763
- Surprise me, Mr. ...?

06:29.098 --> 06:30.766
- Declan Harp.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.934
- Ah.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.861
You'll get it

06:40.901 --> 06:42.861
when the job's done.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.282
- Mr. Declan--

06:43.904 --> 06:46.282
What?!

06:46.615 --> 06:50.077
(speaking Portuguese)

06:46.615 --> 06:50.077
- Ah, Christ. He's cracked.

06:46.615 --> 06:50.077
We're fucked.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.416
(sniffing)

06:56.500 --> 06:58.460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no--

06:58.543 --> 07:01.255
(in Maori):

06:58.543 --> 07:01.255
<i>We should throw him overboard.</i>

06:58.543 --> 07:01.255
(in Portuguese):<i> True.</i>

07:01.339 --> 07:04.091
But that looks

07:01.339 --> 07:04.091
like a delicious bottle.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.682
- I fuckin' hate you.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.355
- Ah!

07:17.437 --> 07:19.606
The lady says yes!

07:19.773 --> 07:23.319
Yes, yes, she will take you

07:19.773 --> 07:23.319
where you want to go.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.319
(laughing)

07:23.402 --> 07:26.238
- And she would be...?

07:23.402 --> 07:26.238
- Madelena, of course.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.700
My ship. My lady.

07:30.701 --> 07:31.994
Sadly...

07:32.077 --> 07:35.289
her sails have faded some,

07:35.373 --> 07:37.833
and she wants some new sails.

07:38.876 --> 07:41.837
So... she's willing to see

07:38.876 --> 07:41.837
where this goes.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.131
Come.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.426
Let me show you her secrets.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.772
- No, sir,

07:58.478 --> 08:00.772
I haven't seen him in weeks.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.025
Especially not

08:00.856 --> 08:03.025
since that theft occurred.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.861
- You had no idea at all

08:03.108 --> 08:05.861
the fort was being robbed?

08:06.570 --> 08:08.947
- No, I mean,

08:06.570 --> 08:08.947
I just serve ale, sir.

08:09.031 --> 08:12.826
- Mm... And any of Mr. Smyth's

08:09.031 --> 08:12.826
friends happen through recently?

08:12.910 --> 08:17.497
- Um, I don't really know

08:12.910 --> 08:17.497
who his friends would be. Um...

08:18.332 --> 08:22.127
- I've seen him with a

08:18.332 --> 08:22.127
Frenchman named Rivard

08:18.332 --> 08:22.127
and a Native girl named Sokanon.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.922
She wears fur in her hair

08:22.211 --> 08:24.922
and brandishes a bow.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.925
I think she's one

08:25.005 --> 08:27.925
of those Lake Walker people.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.969
- Really?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.969
- They are loyal

08:28.008 --> 08:30.969
to your Michael Smyth

08:31.053 --> 08:34.306
and the Black Wolf Company.

08:31.053 --> 08:34.306
Are they not, Mary?

08:35.140 --> 08:37.059
- Maybe,

08:35.140 --> 08:37.059
but as I told the major,

08:37.142 --> 08:39.353
I haven't seen them here

08:37.142 --> 08:39.353
in a while.

08:39.437 --> 08:41.688
- No.

08:39.437 --> 08:41.688
- Hmm...

08:43.774 --> 08:46.526
- Can I get you an ale, Major?

08:43.774 --> 08:46.526
- That'd be wonderful.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.945
(Vanstone): Major?

08:48.737 --> 08:50.364
- Pardon me.

08:50.448 --> 08:52.991
- Here's the list of what we

08:50.448 --> 08:52.991
procured from the Lake Walkers.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.077
- Wonderful.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.662
Looks like a decent haul.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.458
Lock up the storage

08:57.746 --> 09:00.458
and give me the numbers.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.458
See how short we still are.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.502
- Yes, sir.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.502
- The raiding party can rest

09:00.540 --> 09:03.502
for the night,

09:03.585 --> 09:05.587
and then head west at daylight.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.006
- Here you are.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.006
- Please.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.633
- Cheers.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.676
I think you should lead them,

09:09.716 --> 09:11.676
Vanstone...

09:12.303 --> 09:14.805
...as their lieutenant,

09:12.303 --> 09:14.805
effective immediately.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.349
- Excuse me, sir?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.349
- You've earned it.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.229
- I'm honoured, sir.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.229
- Well, carry on, Lieutenant.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.321
Where were we?

09:30.404 --> 09:32.448
- I was about to say...

09:32.990 --> 09:36.618
...there's more on offer here

09:32.990 --> 09:36.618
if you're interested, Major.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.913
- The only thing

09:37.995 --> 09:39.913
I'm interested in

09:39.997 --> 09:42.624
is bringing Michael Smyth

09:39.997 --> 09:42.624
to justice.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.171
And you might want to help me.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.171
Because if not,

09:47.254 --> 09:49.006
I can see to it

09:49.089 --> 09:53.260
that you have nothing left

09:49.089 --> 09:53.260
to offer anyone anymore.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.847
This place and its...

09:56.930 --> 09:58.557
distractions...

09:59.099 --> 10:02.478
are everything that's a problem

09:59.099 --> 10:02.478
with Fort James, Miss...

10:03.437 --> 10:05.147
- Imogen.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.147
- Yes.

10:05.439 --> 10:10.361
If you see Michael Smyth

10:05.439 --> 10:10.361
or any of his cohorts

10:05.439 --> 10:10.361
enter this establishment,

10:10.444 --> 10:12.904
you best break your legs

10:12.988 --> 10:14.656
to get word to me.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.287
Good afternoon.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.504
- Can't even give it away, eh?

10:26.043 --> 10:28.504
(distant laughter)

10:29.380 --> 10:31.673
(man): Are you there, lovey?

10:32.049 --> 10:35.553
(woman): I am.

10:32.049 --> 10:35.553
(laughing)

10:32.049 --> 10:35.553
(man): Are you there?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.971
(woman laughing)

10:35.635 --> 10:37.971
- I am.

10:38.055 --> 10:38.972
- Oh!

10:38.055 --> 10:38.972
(laughter)

10:39.056 --> 10:40.682
- Get out.

10:42.393 --> 10:46.188
- Oh. A third would make this

10:42.393 --> 10:46.188
a lovely tangle, wouldn't it?

10:46.271 --> 10:48.315
(woman laughing)

10:49.274 --> 10:50.609
Come on, Mary.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.694
It's just a little game...

10:53.862 --> 10:56.448
Maybe I'll let you win.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.448
Oh!! Hey!!

10:58.867 --> 11:00.994
- What did I say?

11:01.078 --> 11:02.454
- Fine.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.791
Fine.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.791
- Oi, Mr. Carter.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.293
Wouldn't want

11:06.875 --> 11:08.293
to tire yourself out

11:08.377 --> 11:11.046
before your new wife

11:08.377 --> 11:11.046
gets delivered, would you?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.345
- It's gonna be

11:16.510 --> 11:18.345
a delicate negotiation, Malcolm.

11:18.429 --> 11:21.681
That's a fact. It might be best

11:18.429 --> 11:21.681
if you let me handle this one.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.935
- Ho-ho! Here we go.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.935
You're already trying

11:21.765 --> 11:24.935
to cut me out, eh?

11:25.018 --> 11:28.647
- It's possible that you even

11:25.018 --> 11:28.647
being there might set things

11:25.018 --> 11:28.647
down the wrong path.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.358
- You do have a complicated

11:28.730 --> 11:31.358
history with the Lake Walkers.

11:31.442 --> 11:34.612
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:31.442 --> 11:34.612
What the fuck do you know?

11:35.529 --> 11:39.241
- I know some things, Mr. Brown.

11:35.529 --> 11:39.241
- You think I'm trouble?

11:39.324 --> 11:42.953
You're the one the HBC

11:39.324 --> 11:42.953
are on the hunt for, Michael,

11:39.324 --> 11:42.953
not me.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.624
The Low River Company

11:43.036 --> 11:46.624
has had treaties

11:43.036 --> 11:46.624
with the Lake Walkers for years.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.127
- I remember. I also remember

11:46.706 --> 11:50.127
risking me neck to bail you out

11:50.210 --> 11:51.920
after your brother

11:50.210 --> 11:51.920
attacked Kamenna's grandson.

11:52.003 --> 11:55.466
- I apologized to her

11:52.003 --> 11:55.466
for Cedric's drunken cock-up.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.551
- I don't think it was enough.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.551
- Aye.

11:57.635 --> 12:00.554
Well, he's dead now

11:57.635 --> 12:00.554
and cold in the ground,

11:57.635 --> 12:00.554
so that's that, isn't it, eh?

12:01.138 --> 12:04.891
Our business

12:01.138 --> 12:04.891
has never been the same

12:01.138 --> 12:04.891
since he did what he did.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.394
The Lake Walkers were crucial

12:04.975 --> 12:07.394
to our success.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.732
And now it's down to me

12:09.729 --> 12:12.732
to repair that damage.

12:12.816 --> 12:16.153
I need that chief woman to know

12:12.816 --> 12:16.153
that the Brown brothers

12:16.236 --> 12:18.113
are committed

12:16.236 --> 12:18.113
to dismembering the HBC.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.782
- Good.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.619
So start working

12:21.533 --> 12:23.619
on that apology to Kamenna.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.746
Because if she says no,

12:24.578 --> 12:26.746
we're all doomed.

12:37.048 --> 12:40.427
- Much obliged, Ms. Chaulk.

12:37.048 --> 12:40.427
Much obliged.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.762
- How's he lookin'?

12:44.598 --> 12:45.890
It's not too bad.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.686
- This looks very terrible.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.686
Not good, mate.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.812
- We'll keep trying, Charlie.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.775
- Could be worse.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.775
Could look like McTaggart.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.903
- Or useless,

12:55.859 --> 12:58.903
like that big ball bag.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.903
(Chaulk chuckling)

12:58.987 --> 13:03.033
- Mister Charles gets a pass,

12:58.987 --> 13:03.033
but not you, huh?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.035
There's work to be done.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.349
(Benton): I apologize

13:24.304 --> 13:27.349
for the state of the biscuits.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.851
How is your cabin?

13:30.977 --> 13:34.356
- I will not sit here

13:30.977 --> 13:34.356
and pretend you're not the man

13:30.977 --> 13:34.356
I know, Lord Benton.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.734
You need not pretend, either.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.738
- I suspect what you know of me

13:36.816 --> 13:40.738
has been shaped by factors

13:40.820 --> 13:42.781
other than our interactions.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.825
- If you mean to say

13:42.864 --> 13:45.825
that my opinion of you

13:42.864 --> 13:45.825
has been tainted by Declan Harp,

13:45.909 --> 13:48.161
then let me disabuse you

13:45.909 --> 13:48.161
of that notion.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.163
I came to my own conclusions.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.956
- Oh, I thought

13:50.247 --> 13:51.956
it was Chesterfield

13:52.040 --> 13:54.459
who was holding influence

13:52.040 --> 13:54.459
over you.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.378
Now you've got me

13:54.543 --> 13:56.378
quite intrigued.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.716
- I've seen with my own eyes

13:57.337 --> 14:00.716
that you're a man

13:57.337 --> 14:00.716
that kills with impunity.

14:00.799 --> 14:04.177
- I am a soldier of the Crown

14:00.799 --> 14:04.177
and the Hudson's Bay Company.

14:04.261 --> 14:08.473
Any blood that has been shed

14:04.261 --> 14:08.473
is sanctioned by the charter.

14:11.769 --> 14:13.478
- Do you wish

14:11.769 --> 14:13.478
to spill my blood too?

14:13.562 --> 14:15.897
- I would do no such thing.

14:16.898 --> 14:20.902
Why would I deprive the world

14:16.898 --> 14:20.902
of such a bright star

14:16.898 --> 14:20.902
as yourself?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
- Thank you for the tea,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
Lord Benton.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.992
It's warmed the bones.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.751
I would like

14:32.289 --> 14:35.751
to take the air on deck.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.751
With your permission.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.002
- No need not ask permission,

14:35.834 --> 14:38.002
Grace.

14:38.086 --> 14:41.131
You are free to roam

14:38.086 --> 14:41.131
at your leisure.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.884
But you will dine with me again

14:41.715 --> 14:44.884
tonight,

14:44.968 --> 14:47.679
and tomorrow, and the next...

14:48.096 --> 14:51.433
...until I've managed

14:48.096 --> 14:51.433
to change your mind about me.

15:19.753 --> 15:23.465
(whistling)

15:19.753 --> 15:23.465
- Check the earing

15:19.753 --> 15:23.465
on the mainsail, huh?

15:23.548 --> 15:25.801
We may need a repair up there.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.060
Tighten the bowline,

15:34.184 --> 15:36.060
young Chaulk!

15:42.025 --> 15:43.819
- How much further till land?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.613
Why aren't we moving faster?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.740
- Ask the wind.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.077
We are alone out here.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.915
Save for the creatures

15:54.371 --> 15:56.915
that sleep in the deep.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.962
Madelena is upset.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.508
Yeah. She says

16:03.046 --> 16:06.508
that you are putting us

16:03.046 --> 16:06.508
in danger.

16:06.884 --> 16:10.721
- You tell Madelena

16:06.884 --> 16:10.721
Benton is the one

16:06.884 --> 16:10.721
putting us in danger.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.516
- Who is this Benton

16:11.596 --> 16:14.516
you've been talking about?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.143
Is he a pirate?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.483
You are unsteady here.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.068
(laughing)

16:25.151 --> 16:27.529
I am unsteady on land.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.323
Too much vice.

16:31.199 --> 16:35.453
Madelena is my safe harbour...

16:31.199 --> 16:35.453
and my compass.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.248
Do you see that, Mr. Harp?

16:38.331 --> 16:41.125
Those clouds on the horizon?

16:41.209 --> 16:44.170
That is the sign of Satanazes.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.130
"The Hand of Satan."

16:47.340 --> 16:50.761
It is a great and powerful hand

16:47.340 --> 16:50.761
that reaches up from Hades,

16:50.844 --> 16:53.847
rising up through the water

16:50.844 --> 16:53.847
and into the air...

16:55.014 --> 16:58.226
...searching for a ship of souls

16:55.014 --> 16:58.226
to consume.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.941
And should it clasp you

17:01.020 --> 17:03.941
in its hand, uh,

17:04.023 --> 17:06.067
it may pick you up...

17:07.235 --> 17:09.028
...full fathoms above the waves,

17:09.112 --> 17:11.364
send you crashing

17:09.112 --> 17:11.364
back into the ocean,

17:11.448 --> 17:14.785
or dragging you

17:11.448 --> 17:14.785
to the very bottom of the sea.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.912
Yeah.

17:18.455 --> 17:22.083
And we're about to sail

17:18.455 --> 17:22.083
right into the devil's palm.

17:24.795 --> 17:29.716
Think about making peace

17:24.795 --> 17:29.716
with whatever God you submit to,

17:24.795 --> 17:29.716
Mr. Harp.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.387
You need not worry

17:31.384 --> 17:34.387
how long the journey's

17:31.384 --> 17:34.387
going to take,

17:34.471 --> 17:38.516
because it is never known

17:34.471 --> 17:38.516
that we will come out

17:34.471 --> 17:38.516
the other side.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.352
- We better, Fortunato.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.481
Or I'm gonna haunt you in hell.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.481
(laughing)

17:44.564 --> 17:47.191
- Perhaps we are already there,

17:44.564 --> 17:47.191
Mr. Harp.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.194
Loosen that bowline, Chaulk!

17:50.278 --> 17:52.864
- Yes, sir.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.864
(Declan sniffling)

17:56.493 --> 17:58.453
- Mr. Pond, where have you been?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.372
- Michael Smyth

17:59.412 --> 18:01.372
has left the city.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.751
- I said goodbye to him

18:02.165 --> 18:04.751
before he left.

18:04.835 --> 18:07.128
- Malcolm Brown

18:04.835 --> 18:07.128
has also left the city.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.841
- And you're suggesting

18:08.588 --> 18:10.841
there's a connection?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.634
- And you're suggesting

18:10.924 --> 18:12.634
there's not?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.261
- Michael gave us his word.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.554
- He's Irish.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.766
- So am I.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.766
What's that got to do with it?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.644
- I don't trust him.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.480
We need to make sure

18:23.311 --> 18:25.480
they're not working together.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.567
- Why don't I go and find out?

18:38.201 --> 18:39.243
- Hmm.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.791
(man groaning)

18:46.751 --> 18:48.169
- Mr. Brown.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.172
Oh, my.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.172
(chuckling)

18:51.965 --> 18:54.051
I hope you don't mind

18:51.965 --> 18:54.051
my joining you.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.260
- Ah, what do you want?

18:56.344 --> 18:59.931
Or should I ask,

18:56.344 --> 18:59.931
what does Samuel Grant want?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.392
Drink?

19:03.351 --> 19:07.605
Now... to what...

19:03.351 --> 19:07.605
do I owe this pleasure?

19:11.359 --> 19:14.905
- Michael Smyth has left town,

19:14.988 --> 19:18.700
and... I'm wondering

19:14.988 --> 19:18.700
what his destination could be.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.995
- How could I possibly

19:19.492 --> 19:21.995
know that?

19:22.079 --> 19:25.707
- Well, I fear he's traveling

19:22.079 --> 19:25.707
with your brother, Malcolm.

19:27.375 --> 19:31.170
- My brother is headed up north

19:27.375 --> 19:31.170
to drum up some new business.

19:31.254 --> 19:35.717
I dannae if you've heard,

19:31.254 --> 19:35.717
but new business is quite hard

19:31.254 --> 19:35.717
to come by these days.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.721
Due in no small part

19:35.800 --> 19:39.721
by the actions

19:35.800 --> 19:39.721
of your benefactor.

19:39.804 --> 19:43.641
- Ah. So even if it's true,

19:39.804 --> 19:43.641
you don't know.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.855
- Don't know... what?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.735
- I can't help but wonder

19:50.314 --> 19:53.735
if your brother and Michael

19:53.818 --> 19:55.987
have made a deal

19:53.818 --> 19:55.987
behind your back.

19:56.947 --> 19:58.656
(Douglas chuckling)

20:00.825 --> 20:02.201
- Do you have any proof of this?

20:05.038 --> 20:07.331
- Why not ask the woman

20:05.038 --> 20:07.331
in your house?

20:07.958 --> 20:10.127
She might know something

20:07.958 --> 20:10.127
that you don't.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.753
- Aye.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.966
Says the woman who's a known spy

20:11.836 --> 20:15.966
for Samuel Grant.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.680
- It's hard

20:19.552 --> 20:22.680
when someone you trust

20:19.552 --> 20:22.680
takes advantage of you.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.018
I know that feeling

20:23.556 --> 20:27.018
all too well myself, Mr. Brown.

20:29.395 --> 20:33.357
If I were you...

20:29.395 --> 20:33.357
I'd want to know for certain.

20:38.155 --> 20:40.907
- Please... drink this.

20:40.991 --> 20:45.244
- Thank you, Ms. Chaulk,

20:40.991 --> 20:45.244
but I think I'll be alright.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.340
- Why is this special to you?

20:57.423 --> 20:58.716
- Why?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.302
- Aye...

20:58.800 --> 21:01.302
- Let me tell you why.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.140
It's because

21:01.761 --> 21:05.140
it's the finest malt.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.187
It has a hint of salt

21:06.265 --> 21:10.187
from the coastal Scottish air

21:10.269 --> 21:13.397
that seeped through

21:10.269 --> 21:13.397
into the cask.

21:13.815 --> 21:17.735
The lingering taste

21:13.815 --> 21:17.735
of ancient, mossy oak.

21:18.486 --> 21:23.158
It's like supping the milk

21:18.486 --> 21:23.158
from an angel's tit.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.285
And you don't

21:23.491 --> 21:26.285
even appreciate it, do you,

21:26.369 --> 21:29.122
Captain Numpty?!

21:26.369 --> 21:29.122
(laughing)

21:29.206 --> 21:31.457
- A toast! Huh?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.794
(in Portuguese):

21:32.125 --> 21:34.794
<i>To us, my love.</i>

21:32.125 --> 21:34.794
(laughing)

21:34.878 --> 21:38.673
<i>A special blend</i>

21:34.878 --> 21:38.673
<i>for a special lady.</i>

21:40.925 --> 21:42.343
I love you.

21:43.845 --> 21:49.350
(in Maori):

21:43.845 --> 21:49.350
<i>Best to let him have a drop,</i>

21:43.845 --> 21:49.350
<i>Captain.</i>

21:49.433 --> 21:51.728
- See, Te Rangi,

21:49.433 --> 21:51.728
he probably does want

21:51.811 --> 21:54.689
to lick the delicious sweat

21:51.811 --> 21:54.689
from my forehead.

21:55.606 --> 22:00.195
- Oh, I'll cave your forehead in

21:55.606 --> 22:00.195
if you don't give me back

21:55.606 --> 22:00.195
some of that whiskey.

22:00.278 --> 22:04.115
(laughing)

22:00.278 --> 22:04.115
- Don't be so sad, MacDonald,

22:00.278 --> 22:04.115
huh?

22:05.075 --> 22:08.161
Your bottle

22:05.075 --> 22:08.161
is going to good use.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.413
(laughing)

22:12.082 --> 22:14.625
- Eh, this is mean...

22:16.669 --> 22:19.005
He's upsetting me for no reason.

22:20.673 --> 22:24.594
We don't even know

22:20.673 --> 22:24.594
where that balmy Spanish bastard

22:20.673 --> 22:24.594
is taking us.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.805
He's mad.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.893
We're all gonna end up

22:28.848 --> 22:31.893
in the bottom of the ocean.

22:31.976 --> 22:35.105
(in Maori):<i> Look at him.</i>

22:31.976 --> 22:35.105
<i>Just give him a drink.</i>

22:35.188 --> 22:37.899
(sighing)

22:35.188 --> 22:37.899
- Fine, Te Rangi, fine.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.447
(spitting)

22:42.862 --> 22:44.447
- Ah!!

22:44.530 --> 22:46.908
(Fortunato laughing)

22:44.530 --> 22:46.908
You bastard!

22:44.530 --> 22:46.908
I'm gonna shag you!

22:46.991 --> 22:49.702
- Hey!! That's enough!

22:51.495 --> 22:54.624
(in Maori):

22:51.495 --> 22:54.624
<i>Give him some space. Let's go.</i>

23:01.339 --> 23:03.258
- How you think I'm doing, Harp?

23:05.218 --> 23:06.928
Tell it to me straight.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.769
- It's looking better.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.192
Just drink your water, Charlie.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.280
You'll be good.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.417
(groaning)

23:47.177 --> 23:48.552
- Looking for this?

23:50.930 --> 23:54.642
It's a... a contract

23:50.930 --> 23:54.642
between Michael Smyth

23:50.930 --> 23:54.642
and Carruthers & Co.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.187
Signed by me, apparently.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.187
I mean,

23:57.270 --> 24:01.565
I know I was drunk...

23:57.270 --> 24:01.565
but I wisnae that drunk.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.734
- You left us no choice.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.734
- Hmm.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.363
I knew if there was a deal

24:03.818 --> 24:06.363
between my brother and Michael

24:06.445 --> 24:08.239
that you'd have

24:06.445 --> 24:08.239
had it all written down,

24:08.323 --> 24:10.867
seeing how your solicitor

24:08.323 --> 24:10.867
must sign everything for ya.

24:10.950 --> 24:15.705
- You weren't thinking clearly.

24:10.950 --> 24:15.705
- No, you're

24:10.950 --> 24:15.705
not thinking clearly.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.791
This puts us at war

24:15.788 --> 24:18.791
with Samuel Grant.

24:18.875 --> 24:21.378
Do you have any idea

24:18.875 --> 24:21.378
what that man is capable of?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.087
- How could you ask me that?

24:26.383 --> 24:29.093
- I want him to rot in hell

24:26.383 --> 24:29.093
as much as you,

24:29.177 --> 24:32.013
but this...

24:29.177 --> 24:32.013
will be the end of us.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.098
You mark my words.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.686
You have to put a stop to it.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.686
Now.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.104
- Or what?

24:40.188 --> 24:42.023
- What do you mean, or what?!

24:45.109 --> 24:48.571
- You are nothing

24:45.109 --> 24:48.571
but a figurehead

24:45.109 --> 24:48.571
in this company, Mr. Brown.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.616
You yield no authority

24:49.322 --> 24:52.616
over my or Mr. Pickersgill's

24:49.322 --> 24:52.616
approval.

24:53.284 --> 24:54.702
You would do well

24:53.284 --> 24:54.702
to remember that.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.413
- How dare you speak to me

24:54.785 --> 24:56.413
in that manner?

24:56.495 --> 24:58.373
- I'll speak to you

24:56.495 --> 24:58.373
in whatever manner I choose.

24:58.456 --> 25:01.459
Don't bite the hand

24:58.456 --> 25:01.459
that feeds you, Mr. Brown.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.473
(gasping, then sighing)

25:13.346 --> 25:15.473
- Sokanon.

25:15.556 --> 25:16.891
- I'm tracking a man.

25:15.556 --> 25:16.891
He's Irish,

25:16.974 --> 25:18.935
with an Iroquois wife.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.935
Have you seen him?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.064
- There was a man like that

25:20.519 --> 25:23.064
here. O'Reilly.

25:23.147 --> 25:27.568
I think he's arranging to bring

25:23.147 --> 25:27.568
a country wife to the fort

25:23.147 --> 25:27.568
to marry that fat man, Carter.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.905
- This woman,

25:27.651 --> 25:30.905
where is she coming from?

25:27.651 --> 25:30.905
Is she European or Native?

25:30.988 --> 25:32.573
- I don't know.

25:33.616 --> 25:36.119
- Find out what you can

25:33.616 --> 25:36.119
and meet me back here tomorrow.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.620
Please.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.330
I need your help.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.808
(Benton): Tell me, how was

25:55.805 --> 25:58.808
your wedding?

25:58.891 --> 26:02.145
Was it a nice affair?

25:58.891 --> 26:02.145
Well-attended?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.772
- Nice enough.

26:04.855 --> 26:09.402
- I must say,

26:04.855 --> 26:09.402
I am curious as to what you see

26:04.855 --> 26:09.402
in Captain Chesterfield.

26:09.486 --> 26:13.281
Clearly, dear,

26:09.486 --> 26:13.281
you are the superior intellect.

26:13.364 --> 26:16.784
Though I suppose

26:13.364 --> 26:16.784
that's not saying much, is it?

26:13.364 --> 26:16.784
(laughing)

26:17.785 --> 26:22.499
Yes, you winkled your way

26:17.785 --> 26:22.499
into governess without

26:17.785 --> 26:22.499
much trouble at all, it seems.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.669
- He asked, I answered.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.669
It was rather simple, yes.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.340
- I should've known there was

26:27.586 --> 26:30.340
something between you two.

26:31.007 --> 26:33.050
Oh, you didn't intervene...

26:33.134 --> 26:37.221
when Chesterfield

26:33.134 --> 26:37.221
had Captain Gray and his men

26:33.134 --> 26:37.221
arrest me.

26:37.305 --> 26:39.516
Your loyalty was all to him.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.893
- A woman

26:39.598 --> 26:42.893
should never be compelled

26:39.598 --> 26:42.893
to speak against her husband.

26:42.977 --> 26:46.272
Does the sanctity of marriage

26:42.977 --> 26:46.272
not hold some things dear?

26:46.356 --> 26:50.985
- The sins of the husband

26:46.356 --> 26:50.985
against the Crown

26:46.356 --> 26:50.985
are also the sins of the wife.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.405
Marriage has indeed changed you.

26:55.031 --> 26:58.159
So, tell me,

26:55.031 --> 26:58.159
how was your parents' marriage?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.038
- Fine.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.376
- Your father also fought

27:03.831 --> 27:06.376
for the Crown,

27:06.459 --> 27:09.504
and felled many men

27:06.459 --> 27:09.504
in his military career.

27:11.047 --> 27:13.674
Yet you judge me and not him.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.845
- Well, had you been

27:14.842 --> 27:17.845
a kinder man

27:14.842 --> 27:17.845
when in charge of Fort James,

27:17.928 --> 27:19.805
I might've had

27:17.928 --> 27:19.805
a different opinion of things.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.892
- Your good opinion

27:19.889 --> 27:22.892
matters to me, Grace.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.520
I endeavour to change your mind.

27:29.190 --> 27:33.611
- Continue along the waterway

27:29.190 --> 27:33.611
tomorrow, set up camp here.

27:29.190 --> 27:33.611
I'll meet you there soon enough.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.779
- What will you be doing, sir?

27:33.694 --> 27:35.779
- My job.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.323
- Very good, sir.

27:37.407 --> 27:38.782
- Come.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.911
(Irish jig)

27:38.866 --> 27:41.911
(cheering)

27:48.585 --> 27:50.127
- Are you okay?

27:52.505 --> 27:53.923
What's your name?

27:57.718 --> 27:59.429
I can get you out of here.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.432
- Mrs. Carter!

28:02.515 --> 28:05.976
May I have the honour

28:02.515 --> 28:05.976
of this dance?

28:12.816 --> 28:17.238
These Native women will

28:12.816 --> 28:17.238
fetch you fair coin, O'Reilly.

28:12.816 --> 28:17.238
When can I see these ladies?

28:17.321 --> 28:21.242
- Probably take me a few days

28:17.321 --> 28:21.242
to get the perfect ones.

28:21.325 --> 28:25.622
Most of the women I deal with

28:21.325 --> 28:25.622
found God, wouldn't be suitable.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.958
But there are some women

28:25.704 --> 28:28.958
who come my way that...

28:29.708 --> 28:32.670
...have been unable to embrace

28:29.708 --> 28:32.670
the life of a Christian woman.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.631
That's a lot more interesting.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.215
(Imogen chuckling)

28:36.299 --> 28:37.508
- Good.

28:38.050 --> 28:42.096
Can you do something else for me

28:38.050 --> 28:42.096
before you leave, Mr. O'Reilly?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.773
Great party, huh, Mary?

29:01.574 --> 29:04.160
- Got a question for ya.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.160
- What's that?

29:04.243 --> 29:06.663
- Have you found God?

29:06.745 --> 29:09.999
(Mary screaming)

29:06.745 --> 29:09.999
(both grunting)

29:11.959 --> 29:13.877
(Mary screaming)

29:18.591 --> 29:19.676
- Please...

29:19.758 --> 29:22.637
accept these gifts with respect.

29:30.978 --> 29:36.567
- How many axe heads and rifles

29:30.978 --> 29:36.567
will it take to replace the life

29:30.978 --> 29:36.567
of my grandson, Malcolm Brown?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.820
- There's no such number

29:37.360 --> 29:39.820
that can.

29:40.404 --> 29:43.574
But I will do everything I can

29:40.404 --> 29:43.574
to gain your forgiveness

29:43.658 --> 29:45.660
for my family's part

29:43.658 --> 29:45.660
in your pain.

29:45.743 --> 29:47.662
As you know,

29:47.745 --> 29:51.957
my brother Cedric

29:47.745 --> 29:51.957
was killed for his part

29:47.745 --> 29:51.957
in the capture of your grandson.

29:58.548 --> 30:00.174
- Thank you for meeting with us.

30:01.008 --> 30:04.803
- What news do you bring

30:01.008 --> 30:04.803
from your travels to Montreal?

30:04.887 --> 30:07.598
- I have a deal with the Browns

30:04.887 --> 30:07.598
and Carruthers & Co.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.226
I also have an agreement

30:08.015 --> 30:10.226
from Samuel Grant.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.687
(from outside): I wish for an

30:10.309 --> 30:12.687
audience with your leader.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.606
I'm an officer

30:12.770 --> 30:15.606
of the Hudson Bay Company and...

30:16.940 --> 30:18.693
Michael Smyth.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.695
I've been looking for you.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.822
On behalf of the King and Crown,

30:21.153 --> 30:23.822
you are under arrest.

30:23.906 --> 30:27.493
- For what?

30:23.906 --> 30:27.493
- Theft, conspiracy, murder.

30:27.577 --> 30:31.664
You'll be sent back to England

30:27.577 --> 30:31.664
to be hung for your crimes

30:27.577 --> 30:31.664
against the HBC.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.374
- I never murdered anyone.

30:33.457 --> 30:37.127
- You cannot enforce

30:33.457 --> 30:37.127
your European law

30:33.457 --> 30:37.127
here on my land.

30:37.211 --> 30:39.255
- He's been enforcing his law

30:37.211 --> 30:39.255
everywhere.

30:39.338 --> 30:43.384
He and his thugs stole

30:39.338 --> 30:43.384
everything we had in our stores.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.763
- I have an agreement

30:43.467 --> 30:46.763
with the Crown that

30:43.467 --> 30:46.763
there only be peaceful talks.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.516
- And the Crown had a deal

30:46.845 --> 30:50.516
with you that you do not trade

30:46.845 --> 30:50.516
with criminals!

30:50.600 --> 30:52.727
Now, on your knees.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.104
On! Your! Knees!

30:55.187 --> 30:57.106
- It's alright.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.106
- Go on.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.652
- I see.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.652
You'd like me on my knees, eh?

31:02.820 --> 31:04.238
Eh?!

31:09.619 --> 31:10.828
(roaring)

31:34.143 --> 31:35.770
- And stay down!

31:38.021 --> 31:40.399
- End it! Leave! Go!!

31:40.483 --> 31:44.528
- Oh, I'm leaving,

31:40.483 --> 31:44.528
but you're all coming with me

31:40.483 --> 31:44.528
in chains! And if not...

31:46.989 --> 31:48.532
(gunshot)

32:03.589 --> 32:08.678
(in Cree):<i> What have you done?</i>

32:16.310 --> 32:18.187
- I'm sorry

32:16.310 --> 32:18.187
to call on you so late.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.063
I suppose I should say early.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.400
- Ah, no, no, it's... it's fine.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.400
Is anything the matter?

32:24.943 --> 32:27.488
- I wanted...

32:24.943 --> 32:27.488
I wanted to apologize.

32:27.946 --> 32:31.116
I had no right to imply

32:27.946 --> 32:31.116
any of the things I said.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.369
You were right.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.369
There's no proof,

32:33.452 --> 32:37.206
and it's not my business to...

32:33.452 --> 32:37.206
to insinuate that your brother

32:33.452 --> 32:37.206
would betray you.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.499
- Aye.

32:39.667 --> 32:40.959
But he did.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.391
- Your signature.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.518
You were aware

32:55.474 --> 32:57.518
of the arrangement?

32:57.601 --> 33:01.480
- It's forged.

32:57.601 --> 33:01.480
Quite terribly, I might add,

32:57.601 --> 33:01.480
by my brother Malcolm.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.654
I suppose Cobbs Pond...

33:09.739 --> 33:12.032
...will have an interest

33:09.739 --> 33:12.032
in all of this.

33:13.409 --> 33:17.788
You know how dangerous

33:13.409 --> 33:17.788
and unhinged the man is.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.341
- We were together

33:26.505 --> 33:29.341
since we were kids,

33:26.505 --> 33:29.341
Michael and I.

33:31.969 --> 33:34.638
I knew him better

33:31.969 --> 33:34.638
than I knew myself.

33:34.722 --> 33:38.267
Then we arrived here

33:34.722 --> 33:38.267
and... I don't know.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.143
He's... he's gone.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.021
Or maybe I'm gone.

33:43.105 --> 33:47.985
All I know

33:43.105 --> 33:47.985
is that he betrayed me more

33:43.105 --> 33:47.985
than he betrayed Mr. Pond.

33:48.903 --> 33:50.780
And I can't forgive him

33:48.903 --> 33:50.780
for that.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.783
- Yeah... If you tell Pond

33:50.863 --> 33:53.783
about this deal,

33:53.866 --> 33:56.159
you know what could happen

33:53.866 --> 33:56.159
to Michael.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.707
- All of us carry as much

33:58.036 --> 34:01.707
as we are capable of, Mr. Brown.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.588
And the rest...

34:04.543 --> 34:07.588
falls by the wayside.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.720
Thank you. Huh.

34:15.805 --> 34:17.180
- For what?

34:17.264 --> 34:19.976
- Being the only decent person

34:17.264 --> 34:19.976
I've met

34:20.058 --> 34:22.102
in this godforsaken New World.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.109
- Wait, wait.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.865
Would you care

34:32.279 --> 34:34.865
for another drink?

34:42.832 --> 34:46.752
- I don't think that I like

34:42.832 --> 34:46.752
my ward walking the streets

34:42.832 --> 34:46.752
at night.

34:48.086 --> 34:51.214
How did you enjoy

34:48.086 --> 34:51.214
being Douglas Brown's whore?

34:51.298 --> 34:52.967
- Watch your mouth.

34:57.179 --> 35:01.224
Or do you not... care

34:57.179 --> 35:01.224
to find out what I know?

35:02.434 --> 35:05.145
- Ignore me.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.145
I'm a jealous old man.

35:05.980 --> 35:09.650
I don't want to fight with you.

35:05.980 --> 35:09.650
You're too pretty. Come.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.110
Hmm...

35:12.194 --> 35:14.196
Have a drink with me.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.365
And tell me

35:14.279 --> 35:16.365
about your night.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.241
- It was illuminating.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.785
- How so?

35:20.452 --> 35:24.164
- Douglas Brown knows nothing

35:20.452 --> 35:24.164
about a deal with Michael.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.879
His brother

35:27.459 --> 35:29.879
went behind his back.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.423
And Michael has gone

35:30.629 --> 35:33.423
behind ours.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.259
He lied to us.

35:36.719 --> 35:39.055
- Ah, poor kitten.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.812
We'll have to do something

35:44.351 --> 35:46.812
about that.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.445
- McTaggart.

35:55.529 --> 35:56.822
- Yeah.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.491
- Can you read?

36:00.242 --> 36:02.995
- Can I...

36:00.242 --> 36:02.995
(Charlie laughing)

36:07.666 --> 36:09.126
Gimme that.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.045
Can I read?

36:11.795 --> 36:15.549
- I received it years ago,

36:11.795 --> 36:15.549
when my wife turned ill.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.513
- The seal's never been broken.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.641
(Charlie): I've been afraid

36:22.598 --> 36:24.641
of what's in it.

36:29.605 --> 36:31.648
I'm not afraid anymore.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.987
- "My darling Charlie...

36:39.615 --> 36:43.452
I have no way to know

36:39.615 --> 36:43.452
if this letter will reach you,

36:43.535 --> 36:45.955
but I pray to God above

36:46.038 --> 36:49.750
that it land in your hands

36:46.038 --> 36:49.750
and find you well.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.546
I can still feel the warmth

36:51.835 --> 36:54.546
of your touch

36:54.630 --> 36:57.883
that night

36:54.630 --> 36:57.883
they tore you from my arms...

37:02.220 --> 37:03.889
...from our babies...

37:05.432 --> 37:07.267
...and from my life.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.023
I have taken sick...

37:13.732 --> 37:16.693
...and fear it won't be long now

37:13.732 --> 37:16.693
for me.

37:17.736 --> 37:21.615
And I'm deeply sorry

37:17.736 --> 37:21.615
not to have held you

37:17.736 --> 37:21.615
in my arms...

37:23.241 --> 37:24.910
...one last time.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.126
Your loving wife, Delilah."

37:53.897 --> 37:55.732
- It's time to go home.

38:07.703 --> 38:09.538
(gasping for air)

38:13.917 --> 38:16.336
So many years of my life...

38:18.421 --> 38:21.550
...I wanted to know

38:18.421 --> 38:21.550
what it'd be like

38:18.421 --> 38:21.550
to be a free man.

38:25.221 --> 38:26.763
Now I know.

38:30.059 --> 38:32.686
It's to you I owe thanks

38:30.059 --> 38:32.686
for that, Declan.

38:37.858 --> 38:40.360
Ever since that faithful day

38:37.858 --> 38:40.360
when our paths crossed,

38:40.443 --> 38:43.697
I've been able to choose

38:40.443 --> 38:43.697
the way I live my life.

38:45.699 --> 38:48.285
For that,

38:45.699 --> 38:48.285
I'm eternally grateful.

38:52.081 --> 38:55.375
But it's now that I'd like

38:52.081 --> 38:55.375
to choose how I end my life.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.463
Let me have the last say here.

39:02.424 --> 39:03.717
Please.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.220
It's what I want.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.140
Do it for me, brother.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.394
- Everybody deserves peace,

39:11.850 --> 39:14.394
Charlie.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.031
I'll be seeing you, brother.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.327
- Now, don't take this

39:27.699 --> 39:30.327
the wrong way, but...

39:30.702 --> 39:34.290
...chances are we're headed

39:30.702 --> 39:34.290
to different places.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.125
(chuckle)

39:36.208 --> 39:39.044
Depending on who's working

39:36.208 --> 39:39.044
the scales up there.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.051
- Close your eyes.

39:55.978 --> 39:57.187
(groaning)

39:58.939 --> 40:01.691
(rattling)

39:58.939 --> 40:01.691
Shh...

40:04.361 --> 40:06.404
Shhh...

40:04.361 --> 40:06.404
(Charlie gasping)

40:06.488 --> 40:07.906
Shhh... shhh.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.001
(groaning, gasping)

40:20.336 --> 40:22.462
(sniffling)

40:20.336 --> 40:22.462
(Charlie exhaling)

40:36.268 --> 40:38.103
(steadying breath)

40:56.872 --> 40:59.582
(Te Rangi chanting in Maori)

41:32.241 --> 41:34.368
(chanting continues)

42:51.903 --> 42:54.156
- Captain.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.156
- Welcome back, sir.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.493
- Thank you.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.493
It's good to be here... at last.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.245
This is Mrs. Grace Chesterfield.

43:00.870 --> 43:04.124
She's the governess at one

43:00.870 --> 43:04.124
of my forts in the New World.

43:04.207 --> 43:08.462
And she'll be staying with us

43:04.207 --> 43:08.462
as our guest... indefinitely.

43:09.587 --> 43:13.258
Ah, I will show

43:09.587 --> 43:13.258
Mrs. Chesterfield to her room.

43:13.342 --> 43:14.510
Please.

43:31.443 --> 43:32.861
(man): Who is it?

43:34.946 --> 43:36.281
Grace.

43:40.369 --> 43:41.661
- Da?
