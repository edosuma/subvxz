00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.000
- I tattooed your name
on my ass.

00:16.999 --> 00:17.999
I was really drunk.
- Oh, my God, you did.

00:17.999 --> 00:19.999
- It's a sign of commitment.

00:19.999 --> 00:20.999
- I plan on being with you
for a very, very long time,

00:20.999 --> 00:23.999
so I really just don't
want to f*** us up.

00:23.999 --> 00:24.999
- I don't want you to either.

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
- So are you allowed to, like,

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
still go and have
drinks with me or no?

00:27.999 --> 00:28.999
- That's harmless, right?

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- I'm not asking
to suck your d***.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
I'm asking you to have a drink.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.999
- It'd be better if we were
championing the brand.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.999
- You have somebody who's
buying--when you're talking to,

00:38.999 --> 00:41.999
you know, to--what I'm
trying to--what--all right.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
- Is there something wrong
with you guys?

00:43.999 --> 00:44.999
- I just want to apologize
for the way that I acted.

00:44.999 --> 00:47.999
- I don't trust your motives.
You can do whatever you want.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
Just do it away from me.

00:49.999 --> 00:52.999
- A joint birthday trip.

00:52.999 --> 00:53.999
- I don't like James.

00:53.999 --> 00:55.000
- There was a slight
argument for Kristen.

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
- You're trying to act like
I'm a f***ing psycho

00:57.999 --> 00:58.999
because I don't want
Kristen to go on

00:58.999 --> 01:00.999
a f***ing birthday trip with me?

01:00.999 --> 01:02.999
- Look at this passion.
- Stop!

01:05.999 --> 01:09.999
- ♪ You know

01:09.999 --> 01:11.999

- You be nice to each other.
You be nice.

01:41.999 --> 01:42.999
- Hi, Lisa.

01:42.999 --> 01:43.999
- Hey. Hi.

01:43.999 --> 01:44.999
- How are you?
- Good.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.999
There was poo-poo on the bridge.
Come in.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
Thanks for seeing me.

01:48.999 --> 01:49.999
- Do you want some water or--

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
- Maybe a Xanax too,
if you have any.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
I'm trying to keep my composure
with Lisa,

01:53.999 --> 01:55.999
but she does
have an effect on me.

01:55.999 --> 01:58.999
I'll make this concise.
Tom wanted to be here.

01:58.999 --> 02:00.999
- He should be here if you're
gonna talk about sangria.

02:00.999 --> 02:01.999
Did you do your homework?

02:01.999 --> 02:02.999
- Yeah, I did,
but I need to learn

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
more about the actual process,
the procedure.

02:04.999 --> 02:05.999
- So what's the red made of?

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
- The red?
- The red.

02:07.999 --> 02:08.999
- Well--
- Okay, that's--

02:08.999 --> 02:09.999
- I can learn that stuff
over the night.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.999
- You should know the product
inside out and upside down.

02:12.999 --> 02:13.999
- I don't know everything
I should probably

02:13.999 --> 02:16.999
know about the sangria,
but I have other things

02:17.000 --> 02:20.999
that have been sort of
occupying my mind, so...

02:20.999 --> 02:21.999
I feel like our relationship
has been marred

02:21.999 --> 02:23.999
by multiple letdowns,
and I think I've finally

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
done something right.

02:25.999 --> 02:28.999
I think I've finally
nailed it, and...

02:28.999 --> 02:29.999
- What have you nailed?

02:29.999 --> 02:31.999
- Should I just pull it out?

02:31.999 --> 02:33.999
- God.
Well, it depends what it is.

02:33.999 --> 02:37.999
- So I finally went
and got it.

02:37.999 --> 02:39.999
Your opinion matters to me.
I just want to--

02:39.999 --> 02:40.999
- You're not gonna ask me,
are you?

02:40.999 --> 02:42.000
- I won't get down
on one knee.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
All right, here we go.
- No, no, no.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Now, hold on a second.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
- Ready?
- No.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.999
- Lisa Vanderpump...

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
- Oh, stop it.
Don't even say that.

02:47.999 --> 02:49.999
- You have an amazing husband,
a beautiful family.

02:49.999 --> 02:51.000
You're successful.
- Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.999
- I'm here today to ask you

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
to forget about
all of that, all right?

02:54.999 --> 02:55.999
- Just stop
being so stupid.

02:55.999 --> 02:57.999
- I want you--
I want you to run away with me.

02:57.999 --> 02:58.999
- Just stop being so stupid.

02:58.999 --> 03:00.999
Before I say yes,
I need to look at the ring.

03:00.999 --> 03:01.999
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
Oh, it's gorgeous.

03:10.999 --> 03:13.999
Isn't it?
- Yeah.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
I feel like I've finally
done something right.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
- This is great.
- Yeah.

03:17.999 --> 03:20.999
- It's so sweet, this ring,

03:20.999 --> 03:21.999
and it's so Katie.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.999
She is going to love it.

03:23.999 --> 03:25.999
When are you gonna do it?

03:25.999 --> 03:26.999
- Surprise is so key to me.

03:26.999 --> 03:27.999
I'm gonna blindside her.

03:27.999 --> 03:28.999
- I don't think so.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
- Wait, wait.
No, wait--wait a second--

03:30.999 --> 03:32.000
- No, this is getting
way too complicated.

03:32.999 --> 03:33.999
- This will be a blip.

03:33.999 --> 03:36.999
It wouldn't be me if it was
just super serious,

03:36.999 --> 03:39.999
down on one knee,
straightforward, you know?

03:39.999 --> 03:40.999
I got to put
a little spin on it.

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
Got to Schwartz-ify it
a little bit, you know?

03:42.999 --> 03:43.999
It's a little dose of me,

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
and the rest
is very traditional.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
- She's gonna get a big dose
of you for the rest of her--

03:47.999 --> 03:48.999
of your life.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.000
I mean, really?

03:50.999 --> 03:51.999
You won't find anybody
better than her.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
- I know.
I love her so much.

03:53.999 --> 03:54.999
I don't want
to find anybody else.

03:54.999 --> 03:56.999
- She's great; she puts up
with your crap as well.

03:56.999 --> 03:57.999
Who else would do that?
- Oh, my God, I know.

03:57.999 --> 04:00.999
Well, hopefully,
she says yes.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.999
I didn't even think
about that.

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
What if she says no?
Oh, my God.

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
- Well, she might.

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
Get that ring on her finger,

04:06.999 --> 04:07.999
and walk her down the aisle
as soon as possible.

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
- Yeah.
- Okay?

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
- But don't tell anybody.

04:10.999 --> 04:12.999
- I'm not telling
anybody anything.

04:12.999 --> 04:14.999
- Okay, we should've been
whispering this whole time.

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
- I know.
- Yeah.

04:26.999 --> 04:27.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:27.999 --> 04:29.999
- Good to see you.
- Fancy seeing you here.

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
- I'm just here
to get some Botox.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
Yeah, right.

04:33.999 --> 04:34.999
- I know Ariana's
not exactly excited

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
about how this tattoo
turned out.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
- That's so gross.

04:41.999 --> 04:42.999
- You excited?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.999
- Excited? No.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
- I'm excited.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
- It turns out that I know
the office manager

04:48.999 --> 04:50.999
at this tattoo removal place.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.999
This girl Katie
is friends with Kristen,

04:53.999 --> 04:54.999
so now I'm already
cringing at the fact

04:55.000 --> 04:57.999
that Kristen is gonna find out
about this tattoo.

04:57.999 --> 04:59.999
- I want to see what
we're working with.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.999
- Oh, just wait.
- It's a gem, let me tell you.

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
Maybe I can at least
get a discount.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.999
Katie was being a little
annoying last night.

05:06.999 --> 05:07.999
- I agree.

05:07.999 --> 05:09.999
- Kristen doesn't have
that power over me anymore.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
But you suggesting--
- Look at you know!

05:11.999 --> 05:12.999
But look at you now!
- God, Katie.

05:12.999 --> 05:14.999
Shut up about,
"Look at you now."

05:14.999 --> 05:15.999
Stop saying that.

05:15.999 --> 05:16.999
- Look at you now.

05:16.999 --> 05:17.999
- She's like a mosquito.

05:17.999 --> 05:20.000
This is the most
grudge-bearing group

05:20.000 --> 05:23.999
I have ever come across
in my life,

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
except for when it comes
to Kristen,

05:25.999 --> 05:28.999
who is actually the one person
that it makes the most sense

05:28.999 --> 05:31.000
to just go ahead
and not talk to.

05:34.999 --> 05:36.999
"Twilight Zone."

05:36.999 --> 05:37.999
All right, let's do it.

05:37.999 --> 05:38.999
- Come take a seat.

05:38.999 --> 05:39.999
- All right.
How's it going?

05:39.999 --> 05:40.999
- This is Emily.
- Hi, Emily.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.999
- Nice to meet you, Tom.

05:42.999 --> 05:43.999
- Nice to meet you.
- Emily, hi.

05:43.999 --> 05:44.999
What's going on?

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
- Well, I got a tattoo.

05:47.999 --> 05:51.999
- Where is it?
- It's on my butt.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
- Let me see it.
- Okay.

05:55.999 --> 05:58.999
- Oh, my God.

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
- You don't have to bend over.
- Okay, sorry.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
- It's on the top part
of your butt.

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
The red ink appears
a little bit callous,

06:04.999 --> 06:08.999
and what that can indicate
is a potential red ink allergy.

06:08.999 --> 06:11.000
If I treated it now,
I would give you the same thing

06:11.999 --> 06:14.999
in a scar, and you would have it
for the rest of your life.

06:14.999 --> 06:15.999
- Okay.
- We have to wait.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.000
We have to give it time.

06:17.999 --> 06:18.999
As long as you don't go
sunbathing nude,

06:18.999 --> 06:20.999
we're gonna
have no problem with it.

06:20.999 --> 06:21.999
- Well, I mean, if I were
to go in a tanning bed--

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
- Who does that anymore?

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
- The GX-5000!

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
We're looking at
taking a trip,

06:29.999 --> 06:32.999
so I would actually go in
a tanning bed to prep my skin.

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
- Um, no.

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
- Um...
how much does this cost?

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
- You're my buddy,
so I'm gonna see what

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
25% off gives to us.

06:40.999 --> 06:43.999
Your total is $1,007.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
- Average time it takes
to remove any given tattoo

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
is between 7 and 15 treatments.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
It's about a year-and-a-half,
I believe.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
- Oh, God.

06:53.999 --> 06:56.999
I'm just--ugh.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
Why would I do this?

06:58.999 --> 07:01.999
This tattoo took maybe
15, 20 minutes to put on.

07:03.999 --> 07:07.999
It's going to be
a year and a half to remove it,

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
plus $1,000.

07:09.999 --> 07:13.999
So let me tell you guys,
think before you get ink.

07:13.999 --> 07:17.999
I really hate myself
right now.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- ♪ Shots for seven
all around ♪

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
♪ Another one, baby,
oh, let's go ♪

07:21.999 --> 07:25.999
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh ♪

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
♪ You ain't gonna hustle me ♪

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
♪ No, you ain't
gonna hustle me ♪

07:29.999 --> 07:30.999
- We should get drinks.
- Yeah.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
- Can I get three shots
of tequila chilled--silver?

07:32.999 --> 07:33.999
Lala and I have been
talking about

07:34.000 --> 07:35.999
getting drinks
for a while now.

07:35.999 --> 07:36.999
- Is he bringing them over?
- Yes.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
It's a little weird
because Brittany

07:38.999 --> 07:42.999
is driving across country
as we speak to move here,

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
so I'm not gonna go out
and get drinks with just Lala.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
So that's why Kristen
and Scheana are here.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.999
- I heard that you, mister,

07:49.999 --> 07:52.999
kept your mouth shut last night
and let Katie just get, like,

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
annihilated
from Tom and Ariana.

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
- So what happened?

07:55.999 --> 07:58.999
- We got into the topic
of the birthday.

07:58.999 --> 08:01.999
So we're already a couple shots
deep by this time.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
The main thing
was the guest list.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.999
Obviously, you know, the usual
suspects are all invited,

08:07.999 --> 08:08.999
and your name came up.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
- I wasn't first
on Tom's list, you mean?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.999
- Katie had your back.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.999
She was just like, "Listen,
if you're over Kristen so much,

08:14.999 --> 08:15.999
then why can't you
just let it go?"

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
- God forbid you say,
"Let it go," to Ariana.

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
She's one
of my closest friends,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.999
but she has
a really bad attitude.

08:23.999 --> 08:24.999
- So am I going?

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
- You're putting me
in such a tight spot.

08:28.999 --> 08:31.999
- Hey, it's your birthday.
You can invite whoever you want.

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
- I know.

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
- So...

08:35.000 --> 08:36.999
Do you want me to go?

08:36.999 --> 08:38.999
- I mean, I go into Lock & Key
with my mind set.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
Like, "Listen, Kristen.
You cannot go.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
Tom said no," but...

08:42.999 --> 08:43.999
I want you to come.
I'm gonna fight for you.

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
I'm gonna fight and fight
and fight and fight

08:45.999 --> 08:46.999
and make you proud.

08:46.999 --> 08:47.999
I mean, I just--
I just can't do it.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.999
I just can't look her
in the eyes

08:49.999 --> 08:50.999
and tell her
that she can't go.

08:50.999 --> 08:51.999
- Just book my ticket
and send me the email.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.999
It's fine.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
- Jax needs to understand
that Kristen

08:55.999 --> 08:56.999
will come if she's invited.

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
She'll come
if she's disinvited.

08:58.999 --> 09:00.999
Just because people
don't want her there

09:00.999 --> 09:01.999
doesn't mean
she's not going to come.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.999
- It'll be, like, Sandoval's,
like, surprise birthday.

09:04.999 --> 09:07.999
- Jax has to make it
explicitly clear

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
she's not allowed
on this trip,

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
and he's completely failing.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
- Well, well, well...

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
- You got to be careful
on this floor, man.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.999
- How are you, lovely?
- How are you?

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
- This is not strong enough.
- Hi, babies.

09:19.999 --> 09:20.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:20.999 --> 09:21.999
- You took shots without me?

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
- I'll get you one.
- Sorry, you were late.

09:23.999 --> 09:24.999
- Look, like, are you guys okay?
You two here?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
- Honestly, I don't care;
I don't care

09:26.999 --> 09:28.999
if you're f***ing James
or if you're friends with him

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
or if you're married to him;
I don't give a sh**.

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
So here's the thing about Lala.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
Don't tell me that
you want to be my friend

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
and then continue to hook up
with my ex-boyfriend.

09:35.999 --> 09:38.999
- I have never f***ed James.
I've made out with him.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
- I wouldn't if I were you
at this point,

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
because it's dirty as sh**.

09:43.999 --> 09:44.999
- Whatever.
What is this?

09:44.999 --> 09:47.999
Kristen is just trying
to cock-block James, period.

09:47.999 --> 09:48.999
It has nothing to do with me.

09:48.999 --> 09:52.999
James is not allowed
any pussy.

09:52.999 --> 09:54.999
Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:54.999 --> 09:56.999
- Can I get a shot of vodka?

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
You know me, man.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
- I'm one shot ahead
of you, honey.

10:02.999 --> 10:03.999
- Another!

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
- Sure, no problem.

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
- Did we order
unlimited tequila?

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
- Can we just take a shot?

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
- That's a margarita.

10:13.999 --> 10:14.999
- You can call me a bitch.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.999
Don't call me basic.

10:16.999 --> 10:17.999
- Let me get this
out of your way.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
- Can I hug you? Hug?

10:19.999 --> 10:20.999
- Yes, hug it out.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
She gives amazing hugs.
Sorry, she does!

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
- Give me a f***ing hug.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.999
- You are
a dirty little f***.

10:25.999 --> 10:26.999
- I'm just saying,
she gives really good hugs.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
See how good they are?

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
- When you get liquor in me,

10:30.999 --> 10:31.999
I don't care if the pope

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
and Santa Claus
are in front of me.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.999
Do you need me
to lick your ear?

10:35.999 --> 10:37.999
Hell,
I'll lick the pope's ear.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.999
- I hate to bring this up again.
- What?

10:39.999 --> 10:41.999
- But I am having
a birthday party.

10:41.999 --> 10:44.999
- If you even, right now,
give an invite and not to me,

10:44.999 --> 10:46.999
I will f***ing murder you.

10:46.999 --> 10:49.999
- When's your birthday?
- We are going to...

10:49.999 --> 10:51.999
- Wait.
- Waikiki.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.999
- Wait, am I invited?
Am I invited?

10:53.999 --> 10:57.999
- Does that mean we all...
- He said we.

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
- Yes, you're invited
to my birthday.

10:58.999 --> 11:02.999
- Jax, god damn you.

11:02.999 --> 11:05.999
- Are you excited?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.999
Wait, don't touch him.
Look at him.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
Oh, my God, Jax.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
This is why you shouldn't
have a girlfriend.

11:12.999 --> 11:13.999
- Agreed.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.999
- I can read your f***ing
mind right now.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
You want to f*** her so bad.

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
- If I wanted to take you home
and have sex with you,

11:19.999 --> 11:20.999
I would have done it
a long time ago.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.999
- Keep your hands
above the table.

11:25.999 --> 11:28.999
- Look, he can't do it.
- He's trying to tug his chub.

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
- He's adjusting, yeah.

11:30.999 --> 11:31.999
- Sorry.

11:31.999 --> 11:32.999
- You're not sorry.

11:37.999 --> 11:38.999
- Bad. This is bad.
This is bad.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
This is bad.
This is bad.

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
- Lala is just now
filing her application

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
for Skank of the Year.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.999
- But it's just as bad
that Jax

11:48.999 --> 11:49.999
isn't exactly fighting her off.

11:49.999 --> 11:51.999
- Aw, stop it.

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
- What?

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
I got to go out.

11:53.999 --> 11:55.000
I got to put these flames out.

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
- Coming up...

12:03.999 --> 12:04.999
- I just got moved up.

12:04.999 --> 12:05.999
- You moved in with this one
already, yeah?

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
- Yep.
- You move quickly, Jaxy Boy.

12:07.999 --> 12:08.999
- We took the leap.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
♪ Let me start over again ♪

12:18.999 --> 12:19.999
♪ Let me start over ♪

12:19.999 --> 12:22.999
♪ I want to start over,
let me start ♪

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
♪ Hey, yeah, yeah ♪

12:24.999 --> 12:26.999
♪ Oh, oh, hey, hey ♪

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
♪ Let me start over,
wanna start over ♪

12:28.999 --> 12:29.999
♪ Wanna start ♪

12:32.999 --> 12:35.999
- Oh, God, no.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.999
What was that?
- Oh, God--sorry.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.999
- Oh, my God.
I can smell it.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.999
That's not more curacao?

12:41.999 --> 12:44.999
- A bottle of sambuca
just broke.

12:44.999 --> 12:45.999
- Come on.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
Now you've got to take
everything down--

12:47.999 --> 12:50.999
all the glasses--
and we open in an hour.

12:50.999 --> 12:52.999
- Well, at least we have
those glasses on the other side

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
that we can bring over
on this side

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
while these are all washed.

12:56.999 --> 13:00.999
I f***ing hate sambuca.

13:00.999 --> 13:04.999
It's extremely sticky,
has a really pungent smell.

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
I can't think of a worse thing
to spill on the bar.

13:06.999 --> 13:07.999
- What happened?

13:07.999 --> 13:08.999
- Don't ask.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.999
- It stinks.

13:10.999 --> 13:11.999
- Will you look
at what you're doing?

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
That is why we had this problem
in the first place.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
- I got it.
Don't worry.

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
- Are you really cut out
for the sangria business?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.999
- What have they done?
Nothing.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.999
- Did Schwartz at least bring
some good ideas to the table?

13:20.999 --> 13:22.000
- Are you kidding me? No.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
- No?
- Nothing--tiddly, bloody squat.

13:24.999 --> 13:25.999
Nothing. Zero.
- Are you serious?

13:25.999 --> 13:26.999
- I really wish Schwartz

13:27.000 --> 13:28.999
would've just let me
do the talking.

13:28.999 --> 13:29.999
- This is just getting
damn frustrating.

13:29.999 --> 13:30.999
- I mean, you guys
have got to grow up.

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
I don't know what
you guys are doing.

13:32.999 --> 13:33.999
You're dicking around.
- I don't care what it is.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.999
I just want to see him
commit to something.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
I want to see him
find something--

13:37.999 --> 13:39.999
- I'm happy that Schwartz
is making a commitment

13:39.999 --> 13:42.999
to something, even though
it's not the sangria.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.000
- If he wanted to be
a trash man,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.999
then be the best trash man.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
- Well, that's a whole
other story.

13:47.999 --> 13:51.999
And I'm so excited
just to be in on the fact

13:51.999 --> 13:53.000
that I know before she does,

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
because she is going
to wet herself.

13:55.999 --> 13:57.999
- So, Katie, you did get off
work for my birthday, right?

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
- Yeah.
- Remember, you got to dress up.

13:59.999 --> 14:00.999
- Ugh.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.999
Sandoval makes everyone
dress up.

14:02.999 --> 14:04.999
- Can you stop worrying about
what you're wearing and polish?

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
Shiny. Bright.

14:06.999 --> 14:08.999
- You know, cleaning a shelf
is better with some coaching.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.999
Good luck.

14:13.999 --> 14:15.999
You know.

14:15.999 --> 14:18.999
- Who else knows?
- Nobody knows.

14:18.999 --> 14:22.999
Schwartz has entrusted me
to be his proposal accomplice.

14:22.999 --> 14:25.999
The fun is just getting started.
- Oh, whoa.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
- Holy sh**.
- All right, all right.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.999
- You should see it first.
- You see it first, dude.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
You want to do it right.
- Holy sh**.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
That's f***ing gorgeous.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
It kind of looks like
the suitcase in "Pulp Fiction."

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
- Are those all diamonds
going down the side?

14:37.999 --> 14:38.999
- Oh, sh**.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
- So do you want to get married?
Do you?

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
- Marriage has always
been something

14:42.999 --> 14:43.999
I've looked at as, like,

14:43.999 --> 14:46.999
"Oh, you know, eventually,"
but with Ariana,

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
that someday has gotten
closer than where it was.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
Let's put it that way.

14:51.999 --> 14:52.999
- Well, we've got to get
the other two

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
out the way first, haven't we?

14:54.999 --> 14:55.999
- Yeah.

14:55.999 --> 14:56.999
- I mean, I hope that goes
according to plan.

14:56.999 --> 14:57.999
- I think it'll go good.

14:57.999 --> 14:58.999
- You do?
- Yeah, I really--

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
- Makes me nervous.

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
All right, I better go.

15:01.999 --> 15:03.000
I'll send somebody in
to help you.

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
- All right, thanks.
Sorry about this.

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
- I'll make sure that
we put, like,

15:09.999 --> 15:12.000
a sparkler or something on it
when it comes out.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
All right, we'll see you then.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.999
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
- Are you close?
- All right. Yeah, I'm close.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
I'm getting ready to be there.
Are you excited?

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
- I'm very excited.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
- All right.
I can't wait to see you.

15:25.999 --> 15:26.999
- Okay, can't wait
to see you too.

15:26.999 --> 15:27.999
I'll see you in a minute.

15:27.999 --> 15:29.999
- All right. Bye, baby.
- All right, bye.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
Hi.

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
Hi.
- Hey!

15:37.999 --> 15:38.999
I made it.

15:38.999 --> 15:39.999
- You made it.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
Look at all these boxes.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
- I know.

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
- This is really happening.

15:44.999 --> 15:46.999
What do you got in there?
Jesus.

15:46.999 --> 15:47.999
- A bunch of clothes and shoes.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
- Oh, my God.
- And the trunk's full too.

15:49.999 --> 15:53.999
- Whether I want it or not
anymore, it's kind of too late.

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
How am I gonna fit
all this in my apartment?

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
- We're gonna make it happen.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
- We're gonna make it happen.

15:59.999 --> 16:00.999
I'm sorry that I couldn't
take the day off.

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
- That's okay.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
- I couldn't
'cause I have to work.

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
- It's okay.
- But I'll give you my keys.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.999
- I packed it up by myself.
I'll unload it by myself.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.000
- Do you want to come in?
- Yeah, that's fine.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.999
- Okay.
- Come in for a minute.

16:09.999 --> 16:10.999
- Don't get me wrong.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
I'm excited Brittany's here,

16:11.999 --> 16:15.999
but, you know,
it is moving a little fast.

16:15.999 --> 16:17.999
You're a Cali girl now.
- I know.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
Kentucky to California.
- Are you excited?

16:19.999 --> 16:20.999
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Hey.

16:20.999 --> 16:22.999
- Sorry, I just
got to grab this.

16:22.999 --> 16:24.999
We've met before, right?
I'm James.

16:24.999 --> 16:25.999
- Yeah. I'm Brittany.
I just got moved up.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.000
- You moved out here?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.999
Whereabouts are you living?
- With this one.

16:29.999 --> 16:30.999
- You moved in with this one
already, yeah?

16:30.999 --> 16:31.999
- Yep. Sure did.

16:31.999 --> 16:33.000
- You move quickly, Jaxy boy.

16:33.999 --> 16:34.000
- We took the leap.

16:34.999 --> 16:35.999
- Max a year.

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
This time next year, Brittany
will not be in the picture.

16:37.999 --> 16:38.999
Swear.

16:38.999 --> 16:39.999
Well, best of luck
to you, darling.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.999
- Thanks. Have a good night.
- See you around, all right?

16:45.999 --> 16:47.999
- We have a lot of things
going on this week.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
I got my birthday,
Tom's birthday,

16:49.999 --> 16:52.999
birthday dinner,
birthday lunch.

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
We have Hawaii coming up.
So there's a lot going on.

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
- I'm excited.

16:56.999 --> 16:57.999
- So...

16:57.999 --> 17:01.999
- That'll be fun.

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
- Here's the keys.
- Okay.

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
Dun-dun-dun.
- Drive safe.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
You can go home
and take a nap,

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
and then I'll wake you up
when we get home,

17:07.999 --> 17:08.999
and we'll celebrate.

17:08.999 --> 17:09.999
- How we gonna celebrate?

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
- Oh, I don't know.
I have some ideas.

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
- Okay.

17:12.999 --> 17:16.999
I love you, baby.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
- Okay, drive safe.
- All right. Bye, baby.

17:18.999 --> 17:19.999
- Bye, babe.

17:28.999 --> 17:29.999
- What's up?
- Hi, mister.

17:29.999 --> 17:30.999
- You look pretty.
- Thanks.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
- Did you see who
Jackson's with already?

17:32.999 --> 17:33.999
- Yeah.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
- She's moving in with him.

17:35.999 --> 17:36.999
- She f***ing lives
with him?

17:36.999 --> 17:38.999
- She just told me
she's moving in with him.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
- He told me
that they were just,

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
like, kind of
seeing each other.

17:42.999 --> 17:43.999
- Are we dating?
Absolutely.

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
Would I call her
a girlfriend yet? No.

17:45.999 --> 17:46.999
I don't know
what's going on.

17:46.999 --> 17:47.999
I don't think
it's anything anymore.

17:50.999 --> 17:52.999
- This is exactly what I was
telling you about, though,

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
when I said, "You're gonna
see his true colors."

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
I mean, here he is
with his girlfriend.

17:56.999 --> 17:57.999
That's his girlfriend.

17:57.999 --> 18:00.999
- I am so happy that Jax
did not come home with me.

18:00.999 --> 18:01.999
One,
I wouldn't have remembered.

18:01.999 --> 18:04.999
Two,
Brittany is his girlfriend,

18:04.999 --> 18:07.999
not just some girl from Kentucky
that he knows.

18:07.999 --> 18:11.999
It's a real-live girlfriend
that he hasn't cheated on,

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
at least not with me.

18:13.999 --> 18:14.999
I feel badly for her,

18:14.999 --> 18:17.999
because literally last night,
I was flirting with him.

18:17.999 --> 18:18.999
He was flirting with me.
- You were all over him.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
- Yeah.

18:20.999 --> 18:21.999
We were flirting
with each other, whatever,

18:21.999 --> 18:25.999
and he was like, "Can we f***
and not tell anybody?"

18:25.999 --> 18:27.999
- I'm not trying
to settle down with Lala

18:27.999 --> 18:29.999
or get married to the girl,
for God sakes, you know,

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
but Lala should've honestly
f***ed the sh** out of me

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
by now, though,
because quite frankly,

18:33.999 --> 18:34.999
she's just been teasing me.

18:34.999 --> 18:36.999
I mean, Lala, honestly,
it kind of just pisses me off

18:36.999 --> 18:37.999
that you're going off doing that

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
with f***ing snot-nose
over there.

18:39.999 --> 18:41.999
It's just f***ing--
it's gross, you know?

18:41.999 --> 18:43.999
- I do have a good time
with James,

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
but I also don't want
a relationship.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.999
In my head, we're one step up
from cuddle buddies,

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
one step down
from f*** buddies.

18:50.999 --> 18:51.999
We're Netflix and chill.

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
I don't f***ing know.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.999
I've--definitely,
last night was my bad,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.999
but I'm gonna blame it
on the alcohol.

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
I'm sorry. I'm going to.
- Okay.

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
- And I don't--
- That's fine. I don't--

19:00.999 --> 19:02.999
- Well, I feel like
you should give me credit

19:02.999 --> 19:03.999
because I was completely honest
with you just now.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:05.999 --> 19:06.999
I'm not, like, raising my voice
angry or anything.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
I can't say I'm not upset,
but, you know,

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
you certainly know
how to make a boy jealous.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.999
- Aw, you're cute
when you're jealous.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.999
- Good thing dumbass Jax just
took himself out of the game

19:15.999 --> 19:17.999
by having
Kentucky Fried Chicken

19:17.999 --> 19:19.999
move in with him into
his sh***y little apartment.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.999
Good boy, Jax.

19:21.999 --> 19:22.999
- Here's the awkward thing,
though.

19:22.999 --> 19:23.999
- What?

19:23.999 --> 19:26.999
- I got invited to Hawaii
for Jax and Tom's birthday.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.999
- Oh, my God, dude, do you see
what he's trying to do?

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
He's trying to make sure
he can, like,

19:30.999 --> 19:31.999
get with you and then
try and get with her.

19:31.999 --> 19:32.999
- No.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.000
- Watch, it's exactly
what's gonna happen.

19:34.999 --> 19:35.999
- Dude, he's a grown-ass
old man.

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
If that's, like,
the way he works,

19:37.999 --> 19:39.999
what the f*** is wrong
with this guy?

19:39.999 --> 19:40.999
- I guarantee you
that's his game plan.

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
I'm gonna be going too,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.999
'cause I'm not missing
a trip to Hawaii.

19:43.999 --> 19:46.999
That's for damn sure.
That's gonna be so f***ing fun.

19:46.999 --> 19:47.999
- I'm just gonna walk
around all day

19:47.999 --> 19:49.999
with a f***ing coconut
in my hand.

19:49.999 --> 19:52.999
- Yes, just a coconut
in your hand, please.

19:52.999 --> 19:56.999
- Naked with a coconut
in my hand.

19:56.999 --> 19:57.999
- Mmm.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
- Coming up...

20:01.999 --> 20:03.999
- It's Ariana in his ear
that makes it worse.

20:03.999 --> 20:04.999
She specifically said,

20:04.999 --> 20:06.999
"If you guys are gonna be
friends with Kristen again,

20:06.999 --> 20:07.999
then you're not my friends."

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
No one tells me who I can
and can't be friends with.

20:28.999 --> 20:29.999
- Yes?

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
- It's your favorite
Sur employee.

20:31.999 --> 20:32.999
- That voice--
I doubt it somehow.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.999
- Had to come
and get my paycheck.

20:34.999 --> 20:36.999
- Can't believe that
I actually pay you.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
It's unbelievable.
- I work hard.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
- Jax, come on.

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
- Um, question.
- Yes?

20:42.999 --> 20:46.999
- It's mine and Tom Sandoval's
birthday coming up next week.

20:46.999 --> 20:47.999
- And you want to invite me
to your party?

20:47.999 --> 20:48.999
- Actually, I wanted you

20:48.999 --> 20:50.999
to jump out of the cake,
if that's possible.

20:50.999 --> 20:51.999
- Oh, yeah. Right.
Okay, no problem.

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
Next question.

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
- We were thinking
of doing it in Hawaii.

20:54.999 --> 20:56.999
- Hold on a second.
When is it?

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
- Next week.

20:58.999 --> 20:59.999
- Next week?

20:59.999 --> 21:00.999
The schedule's
already been done.

21:00.999 --> 21:03.999
I hate it when they organize
these kind of elaborate trips,

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
and they all want
to go together,

21:05.999 --> 21:06.999
because it kind of
puts the restaurant

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
in a little bit of a spin,
but they don't think about that.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
They're just thinking
about their trip.

21:10.999 --> 21:11.999
- We want to do it
during the week, like,

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
a Tuesday to Friday situation
because it's cheaper,

21:13.999 --> 21:14.999
because we all have to work,

21:14.999 --> 21:15.999
and the weekends
are just too expensive.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.999
- Will you be back Friday night?
- Yes.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
- How many of you?

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
- Myself, obviously--
Tom Sandoval, Katie, Scheana,

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
Ariana, Lala, and Faith,

21:24.999 --> 21:27.999
which brings me into
inviting Max as well.

21:27.999 --> 21:28.999
- Why invite Max?

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
- Well, he's been
hanging out with Faith.

21:30.999 --> 21:31.999
- Yeah, but just barely.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.999
- These two have been
having a little bit of fun,

21:33.999 --> 21:34.999
so we're gonna switch right now.

21:34.999 --> 21:35.999
I think he should be
sitting next to--

21:35.999 --> 21:38.999
- Move it over, girl.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
- I'd rather you didn't
invite Max, to be honest.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.999
These trips can kind of
get a little crazy.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
They're tattooing their ass...

21:44.999 --> 21:45.999
- Oh, my God.

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
- Oh, my God!

21:47.999 --> 21:49.999
- Drinking shots
out of people's butts...

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
Be getting into punch-ups...

21:53.999 --> 21:54.999
- You want to go,
mother****er?

21:54.999 --> 21:55.999
Let's go.

21:55.999 --> 21:58.999
- What mother would want
their son to go away

21:58.999 --> 22:00.999
on vacation
with Jax Taylor?

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
I mean, is there a mother
out there?

22:02.999 --> 22:03.999
I doubt it.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
If he gets in any trouble,
I'm coming after you.

22:05.999 --> 22:06.999
- I mean,
Peter's going too,

22:06.999 --> 22:07.999
so Peter likes
to look out for Max.

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
- Peter's going as well?
- Yeah.

22:08.999 --> 22:09.999
- Oh, you forgot to mention

22:09.999 --> 22:10.999
that my assistant manager's
going.

22:10.999 --> 22:12.999
- I forgot to mention that.

22:12.999 --> 22:13.999
- Just a little thing--
"Oh, Peter's going too."

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
I'm not gonna be
compromising anything

22:15.999 --> 22:17.999
because of your birthday,

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
so you make sure to tell
each and every person

22:19.999 --> 22:21.999
they've got to get
their own shifts covered.

22:21.999 --> 22:22.999
- Sounds good.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
I'm not gonna leave you
fully shorthanded.

22:24.999 --> 22:25.999
I'm gonna leave you
a couple busboys.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
James will be here.

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
- You just don't like James.
You've never liked James.

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
- Well, I don't--
I don't really need a reason.

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
It's my birthday.
I don't want him there.

22:31.999 --> 22:32.999
- Okay.
- Period.

22:32.999 --> 22:34.999
- Well, suits me.
What do I care?

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
- And I'm also
bringing Brittany.

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
- So it's serious now,
is it?

22:37.999 --> 22:39.999
- It's as serious as it can be
at this point, I guess.

22:39.999 --> 22:41.999
- As it can be,
as you're capable of being--

22:41.999 --> 22:42.999
- Well, she moved here.

22:42.999 --> 22:43.999
- She moved here for you?

22:43.999 --> 22:45.999
- It just kind of happened.

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
- She'll see through you.
- Think so?

22:47.999 --> 22:48.999
- Oh, yeah.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
It's not gonna take long.
All right?

22:50.999 --> 22:53.999
- She's having a 90-day
trial period.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
- Oh, for God's sake.

23:08.999 --> 23:09.999
- Thank you.

23:09.999 --> 23:10.999
- Here you go, my love.
- Yum, yum, yum.

23:10.999 --> 23:11.999
- Let me know
if you need it stiffer.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
- No, I trust this is--
I'm sure this is good.

23:13.999 --> 23:14.999
You know your drinks.

23:14.999 --> 23:15.999
Can we really just hang out

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
and just turn up
in Hawaii, though?

23:17.999 --> 23:20.999
'Cause I really need to get
out of the U.S., period.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.999
Well, actually,
Hawaii's the U.S.

23:23.999 --> 23:24.999
- I love and adore Faith.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
She's just so genuine.

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
Like, I just get a good vibe
from her.

23:28.999 --> 23:29.999
I like her.

23:29.999 --> 23:31.999
Well, I have news for you.

23:31.999 --> 23:34.000
I touched James's pee-pee.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
- What?
How big is it?

23:36.999 --> 23:37.999
I'm just really curious
to see what it is

23:37.999 --> 23:40.999
that you find sexually
attractive about James.

23:40.999 --> 23:41.999
- I don't know.

23:41.999 --> 23:44.999
I don't really know what
I'm doing with James right now.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.999
I'm breaking my own rules.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
Rules I made up,
I'm going against.

23:48.999 --> 23:50.999
With James, like, I just want
to make out with him

23:50.999 --> 23:52.999
and hang out with him
all the time.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.999
The thing with Jax, though,
it's like,

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
I don't really want
to hang out with Jax,

23:55.999 --> 23:58.999
but there's this weird
sexual tension there.

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
We went to Lock & Key
the other night.

24:00.999 --> 24:02.999
He's, like, making comments
about, like, "We're gonna f***,"

24:02.999 --> 24:04.999
and I'm, like, returning--
whatever.

24:04.999 --> 24:05.999
But Jax walks me out,

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
and then I text Jax
at, like, 3:00 in the morning

24:07.999 --> 24:09.999
that just says,
"Come get in my bed."

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
I noticed this
the next morning.

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
- Ho moment.
#HoMoment.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
- Jax doesn't tell me
much, though.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
As far as I was concerned,

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
he and Brittany
were not together.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
When a guy
is in a relationship,

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
I have no problem
not flirting.

24:22.999 --> 24:23.999
I can back the f*** off.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.999
If I knew this type of stuff,

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
then I would definitely
be acting

24:27.999 --> 24:28.999
a completely different way.

24:28.999 --> 24:30.999
- You would?

24:30.999 --> 24:33.999
- But drunk Lala
tends to forget those rules.

24:33.999 --> 24:37.999
The goal in Hawaii is to
remember, "Don't flirt with Jax

24:37.999 --> 24:39.000
when you're intoxicated."

24:39.000 --> 24:40.999
- When it comes
to Jax and Brittany,

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
I do like Brittany,
but at the same time, like,

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
Brittany knows
who she's dating.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.999
Figure it out.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.999
- ♪ Last night,
ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ♪

24:51.999 --> 24:56.999
♪ Livin' that right,
ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ♪

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
- Memories on this street.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.999
Right across the street--

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
I used to live right there.
- I've never been here.

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
You haven't been to her place,
have you?

25:03.999 --> 25:04.999
- I haven't been
to her apartment, no.

25:05.999 --> 25:08.999
- You don't have to knock.
- Ooh.

25:08.999 --> 25:09.999
- Welcome.
- You have really high ceilings.

25:09.999 --> 25:11.999
- This is nice.

25:11.999 --> 25:13.999
- Finally having Katie
and Scheana

25:13.999 --> 25:14.999
over to my apartment

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
means the world.

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
We've been friendly lately,

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
but I think
this is our next step

25:20.999 --> 25:21.999
into being friends again.

25:21.999 --> 25:24.999
So I have your hopefully
really good lasagna.

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
No carbs, no meat.

25:26.999 --> 25:29.999
- Is my name in this?

25:29.999 --> 25:30.999
"People I Want
To Punch In The Face."

25:30.999 --> 25:31.999
- Your names aren't in it.

25:31.999 --> 25:33.999
- Ariana's name
is probably first.

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
- Kristen's someone
I was so close to

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
for a long period of time.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
- That's how I get my aggression
out these days.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
- We've definitely had
some really bad times,

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
- What the f***
have I ever done to you?

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
- Stop.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.000
- I've done nothing but have
your f***ing back

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
for three years straight.

25:47.999 --> 25:50.999
- But the fact is, Kristen
has been trying to make amends,

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
and Scheana and I
are just responding to that.

25:52.999 --> 25:55.999
- This is so cute.
- Thanks.

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
The walls are
a little bare

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
'cause I had to
de-James the house.

25:58.999 --> 25:59.999
- Yeah.
- Right.

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
- But it's getting there.

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
It's my first
little bachelorette pad.

26:02.999 --> 26:03.999
- All by yourself.
- Yeah.

26:03.999 --> 26:04.999
- I like it.
- Yeah.

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
- I know; sometimes
I miss living alone.

26:06.999 --> 26:07.999
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.999
- How are things
with Schwartz?

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
I haven't seen Schwartz
in so f***ing long.

26:11.999 --> 26:12.999
- He's been on my nerves
a little bit.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
He went to Vegas...
- Right.

26:14.999 --> 26:15.999
- Which I was not happy about.

26:15.999 --> 26:18.999
I was like, "Dude."
Like, and then he did--

26:18.999 --> 26:19.999
- Like, what?
What's--

26:19.999 --> 26:20.999
- He got "Bubba" tattooed
on his right butt cheek.

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
- Oh, I heard about that.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.999
- Yeah, so he does
these things.

26:24.999 --> 26:25.999
That's permanent.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
That's, like,
more permanent than a--

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
- Than a f***ing ring
on your left hand.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
- So I'm trying
to not have a big reaction,

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
because I don't want
to ruin it.

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
I went ring shopping
with Schwartz.

26:35.999 --> 26:37.999
I know the proposal
is coming.

26:37.999 --> 26:40.999
I don't know when
because he hasn't told me.

26:40.999 --> 26:42.999
I'm just like--

26:42.999 --> 26:44.999
- Obviously I know
Jax has been

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
talking to you about wanting
to invite you to the birthday,

26:46.999 --> 26:49.999
but he hasn't really been as
honest with Sandoval about it.

26:49.999 --> 26:50.999
- Right.
- So when we've been around--

26:50.999 --> 26:51.999
- He's being a pussy.

26:51.999 --> 26:52.999
- Yes.
- Yeah.

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
- I've been friends with Jax
longer than anyone

26:54.999 --> 26:56.999
other than Sandoval.

26:56.999 --> 26:58.999
- But it's Ariana in his ear
that makes it worse.

26:58.999 --> 27:01.999
According to her,
you want her to die.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.999
- I know.
I get it.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.999
It was crazy, but the way
they're acting is as if

27:05.999 --> 27:09.999
you, like, killed their dog...

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
and then, like,
took a sh** on it

27:10.999 --> 27:11.999
and then put it in the mail
and sent it.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
Like, I mean,
just the most insane stuff.

27:13.999 --> 27:14.999
I'm like,
"Stop victimizing yourself,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.999
and if someone apologizes,
just be like, 'Okay, cool.'"

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
- She has specifically said,
"Well, if you guys

27:19.999 --> 27:20.999
"are gonna be friends
with Kristen again,

27:20.999 --> 27:22.999
then you're not my friends."
- She said it that night.

27:22.999 --> 27:23.999
- Like, she's said it
multiple times, and I'm sorry--

27:23.999 --> 27:25.999
no one tells me who I can
and can't be friends with.

27:25.999 --> 27:28.999
- Sandoval's never gonna agree
to wanting me to come.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
- He won't do it.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.000
He won't.
Like, Jax said earlier--

27:32.999 --> 27:34.000
he said today--he goes,
"I'm sorry that you guys

27:34.999 --> 27:37.999
are having to deliver
this information to her."

27:37.999 --> 27:40.999
- I have to give up
on Hawaii.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
Aloha, Ariana.

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
You won.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- I don't want to throw away
my friendships with them,

27:45.999 --> 27:46.999
but when you're being
that unreasonable,

27:46.999 --> 27:47.999
what am I supposed to do?

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
- Right, it's stressing me
the f*** out.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
My PMS is, like,
at an all-time high right now.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.999
Like, don't f***ing
piss me off this week.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
Don't do it.
- Coming up...

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
- Make sure, whatever you're
gonna say before you whip

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
that ring out,
make it really fast.

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
- Ring then mini-speech?
- Yeah.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
- Well, I think mini-speech
then ring.

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
- Then she's gonna
know what's coming.

28:23.999 --> 28:24.999
- Hello?

28:24.999 --> 28:25.999
- Hey, what's up, man?

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
- What's going on,
Big Daddy?

28:26.999 --> 28:27.999
Huh?
- I'm a little hungover.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
- You're looking
a little bedraggled.

28:29.999 --> 28:30.999
But I got ya...

28:30.999 --> 28:31.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:31.999 --> 28:32.999
- For real?
- Come take a look.

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
- Dude...
- Look at this.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
- Thank you, man.
- Watch how sexy this is.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
- Hey.
- It's a baby.

28:37.999 --> 28:41.999
- Will you continue
being my friend?

28:41.999 --> 28:42.999
I got to practice.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
We'll get to that.

28:44.999 --> 28:45.999
- I'm a little nervous.

28:45.999 --> 28:46.999
I got some fresh digs.

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
I thought I'd run it by you.
- Yeah?

28:48.999 --> 28:49.999
- I want to be fresh tonight.

28:49.999 --> 28:51.999
I had a nice, healthy breakfast.
I worked out.

28:51.999 --> 28:53.999
Now that it's, like,
within a few hours

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
of going down,

28:54.999 --> 28:57.999
I'm a little worried
about so many moving pieces.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
- My advice to make it
more of a surprise--

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
make sure, whatever
you're gonna say

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
before you whip that ring out,
make it really fast.

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
- Ring then mini-speech?
- Yeah.

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
- Well, I think mini-speech
then ring.

29:07.999 --> 29:08.999
- Then she's gonna
know what's coming.

29:08.999 --> 29:10.000
So you whip that ring out
right--

29:10.999 --> 29:11.999
- Well, she's gonna
know it's coming

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
when I get down on one knee.

29:12.999 --> 29:15.999
- Can I be standing behind Katie
like a pageant mom?

29:15.999 --> 29:16.999
- Coaching me?
- Yeah.

29:16.999 --> 29:18.999
- Want to?
No, don't ruin it.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.999
- This is by far
the biggest step in commitment

29:21.999 --> 29:23.999
that Schwartz has ever taken
or had in his life.

29:23.999 --> 29:26.999
I can't help but feel
a sense of pride

29:26.999 --> 29:29.999
in knowing that I have at least
helped shape Schwartz

29:29.999 --> 29:30.999
a little bit.

29:30.999 --> 29:31.999
We're gonna eat dinner.

29:31.999 --> 29:34.999
After they clear the entrees,
that is the cue.

29:34.999 --> 29:36.999
- What if after the entrees
start getting cleared,

29:36.999 --> 29:37.999
I make, like,
a birthday speech?

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
- No, no.
Don't do that.

29:39.999 --> 29:41.999
Don't do that.
No, that'll confuse me.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.999
I'm not nervous, but--

29:45.999 --> 29:46.999
- You sure?
- Yes.

29:46.999 --> 29:49.999
Maybe I should've
simplified it a little bit.

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
Just--no, yeah, yeah.
I'll be cool.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.999
So I go down on one knee,
and then hopefully she says yes.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
- It'll be so surprising.

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
- I need to give her a second
to acknowledge what's going on,

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
and then I'm just like,
"Bada-bing, bada-boom.

30:01.999 --> 30:02.999
"P.S. I love you.

30:02.999 --> 30:04.999
Let's go to Hawaii
and have lots of fiancé sex."

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
- That's amazing.
Sh**.

30:06.999 --> 30:07.999
- Hawaii fiancé sex--

30:07.999 --> 30:08.999
that's got a great ring
to it.

30:08.999 --> 30:10.999
- Dude, let me see
what you got over there.

30:10.999 --> 30:11.999
- All right,
you want to see an outfit?

30:11.999 --> 30:12.999
- Yeah.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
- This--I was gonna
do this with this.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.000
These.
- Let me see this.

30:16.999 --> 30:17.999
- I don't want to look
conspicuously overdressed.

30:17.999 --> 30:19.999
You don't think it's too much?

30:19.999 --> 30:22.999
- I styled Schwartz on his
very first night out in L.A.

30:22.999 --> 30:26.999
All he had was flip-flops
and really torn jeans.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.000
It's double-breasted.
It's 100% top-shelf.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.999
Nothing's really changed,

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
so, of course,
he's coming over here

30:31.999 --> 30:33.000
for some style advice.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.999
Do the tie.
Just don't button it.

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
I like it, dude.

30:35.999 --> 30:36.999
I think it's good.
- Yeah.

30:36.999 --> 30:38.000
- Dude, I'm your ace
in the f***ing hole, man.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.999
- I'm ready to rock and roll.
Yeah.

30:39.999 --> 30:40.999
- Dude, we've been
through a lot, man.

30:40.999 --> 30:42.999
- Dude,
that's real talk, man.

30:42.999 --> 30:43.999
- Would you ever think
that, like,

30:44.000 --> 30:45.999
answering a Craigslist ad--

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
- My oversized polo shirt.

30:47.999 --> 30:50.999
Remember, I just went in circles
when I first walked in here?

30:50.999 --> 30:53.999
I was so overwhelmed.
I was f***ing terrified.

30:53.999 --> 30:54.999
I didn't leave my room
for three months.

30:54.999 --> 30:55.999
- You didn't.

30:55.999 --> 30:57.999
- I played online poker
every single day.

30:57.999 --> 31:00.999
- Our friendship started
from a Craigslist ad.

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
Schwartz was living in Florida,

31:01.999 --> 31:04.999
and he had dreams
of moving to Hollywood.

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
I had just had a real deadbeat
roommate beforehand.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
We have the same name.

31:08.999 --> 31:09.999
We were the same age,
same initials.

31:09.999 --> 31:11.999
It just seemed like fate.

31:11.999 --> 31:14.000
Crazy to see how far
this friendship has come.

31:14.999 --> 31:17.999
- From Craigslist conversations
to f***ing being by my side

31:17.999 --> 31:19.999
when I propose to my girl.

31:19.999 --> 31:20.999
Holy sh**, man.

31:20.999 --> 31:21.999
- It's awesome, man.
Dude, give me a hug.

31:21.999 --> 31:22.999
- All right.
- Give me a hug, man.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
- All right.
- I love you, dude.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
- Dude, just no crying
before me tonight, okay?

31:26.999 --> 31:27.999
- I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
- Yeah?

31:27.999 --> 31:28.999
- You're gonna look
great tonight.

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
Iron that f***ing shirt,
though.

31:30.999 --> 31:31.999
- I'll send you a pic.

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
I'm gonna iron it.
I'll iron the shirt.

31:33.999 --> 31:34.999
Love you.

31:34.999 --> 31:35.999
- Love you, dude.

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
- See you at dinner.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
- All right.

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
What do you think, Charlotte?

31:39.999 --> 31:42.999
Yeah?
I feel good about it too.

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
- Oh, you got to get
the penne Sicilian pasta

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
if you like pasta.

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
It's honestly--I don't know
how they make the sauce.

31:54.999 --> 31:55.999
It's unbelievable.

32:07.999 --> 32:09.999
What the f***?

32:09.999 --> 32:11.999
Tuesday...

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
Wednesday...

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
- Are you not supposed
to be on the floor?

32:19.999 --> 32:20.999
- Yeah, I'm just checking
the schedule real quick.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.999
I wanted to, in fact,
get it covered...

32:22.999 --> 32:24.999
- Covered for what?
- Monday through Friday.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
I heard everyone's
going to Hawaii,

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
so I wanted to join them
and see if I can get covered.

32:28.999 --> 32:31.999
- Listen, I don't think you need
to worry about Hawaii.

32:31.999 --> 32:32.999
Just saying.
- Why do you say that?

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
- Have you actually
been invited to Hawaii?

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
- Well,
I'm assuming I am.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
Me and Tom are buddies.
Everyone else is off, you know?

32:38.999 --> 32:40.999
- You're not on the best
of terms with Jax.

32:40.999 --> 32:41.999
- Talk to Jax?
Has Jax said--

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
- I have spoken to Jax, yes.

32:43.999 --> 32:46.999
- What did Jax say?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
What?
He doesn't want me to go?

32:48.999 --> 32:49.999
- I don't understand
why you want to go.

32:49.999 --> 32:52.999
In fact, it was at this very
spot just a little while ago

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
you guys wanted
to kill each other.

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
- You don't know me.
You don't know my life.

32:55.999 --> 32:56.999
- You don't know me.
- Yes, I do.

32:56.999 --> 32:58.000
- Really, 'cause my
ex-girlfriend's

32:58.999 --> 32:59.999
telling you all about it?

32:59.999 --> 33:00.999
- Hey, stop it right now.

33:00.999 --> 33:02.999
- Lala has
the entire week off,

33:02.999 --> 33:03.999
so she's gonna be going.

33:03.999 --> 33:04.999
Faith has the entire week off.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.999
She's gonna be going, which
means Max is gonna be going.

33:07.999 --> 33:08.999
- I don't know
if Max is going.

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
- Those are my three
closest friends right now.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
Jax and I don't get along,
but it's not like

33:11.999 --> 33:12.999
I can't stay out
of his f***ing way

33:12.999 --> 33:14.999
for four days while
I'm enjoying myself in Hawaii,

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
and I'm probably gonna
be staring at Lala's tits

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
the whole time,
so it's not gonna really matter.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
I'm gonna talk to him,
and I'm gonna get it covered.

33:20.999 --> 33:21.999
That's the best
I can do right now.

33:21.999 --> 33:23.999
I'm not missing
this trip--

33:23.999 --> 33:24.999
- Can you go back
on the floor?

33:24.999 --> 33:27.999
Stop gawking at
the bloody schedule.

33:27.999 --> 33:29.999
- Can I take a picture?
- Forget about the schedule.

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
Take a picture of what?

33:30.999 --> 33:31.999
- I'm gonna take a picture
of the schedule

33:31.999 --> 33:32.999
so I can make sure
that I'm gonna get this covered.

33:33.000 --> 33:33.999
- Get out of here.
- All right.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.999
- I'm telling you, now.
Go back.

33:35.999 --> 33:36.999
- All right.

33:38.999 --> 33:39.999
- Ridiculous.

33:39.999 --> 33:40.999
Coming up...

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
- I can't breathe.

33:41.999 --> 33:44.999
I can feel my heart rate
just start accelerating.

33:44.999 --> 33:45.999
I'm like,
"f***, f***, f***, f***."

33:56.999 --> 33:59.999
♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh ♪

33:59.999 --> 34:01.999
♪ I know what I'm feeling ♪

34:01.999 --> 34:02.999
♪ This is our new beat ♪

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
♪ I don't know
if it's forever ♪

34:04.999 --> 34:07.999
♪ If it's all meant to be ♪

34:07.999 --> 34:08.999
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, guys.

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:10.999 --> 34:11.999
- How's it going, guys?

34:11.999 --> 34:13.999
- Look at you.
You look sexy per usual.

34:13.999 --> 34:15.999
This whole birthday dinner
and drinks

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
is just a front
for Schwartz's engagement.

34:17.999 --> 34:19.999
- Happy birthday to Tom.
- Happy birthday, Tom.

34:19.999 --> 34:22.999
- I'm so excited for Hawaii.
- ****.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- How do you get her
dressed up,

34:24.999 --> 34:26.999
out of the house,
in front of a bunch of people,

34:26.999 --> 34:27.999
and have her distracted?

34:27.999 --> 34:30.999
I mean, my birthday
is just--it just has to be it.

34:30.999 --> 34:33.999
It's the perfect opportunity.

34:33.999 --> 34:34.999
- Eye contact, everyone.

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
Good sex. Eye contact.

34:36.999 --> 34:39.999
- Me and Tom look at each other
right when you said that.

34:39.999 --> 34:41.000
- Are you guys ready to order?
- Yeah.

34:41.999 --> 34:42.999
- All right,
that's what I was looking at.

34:42.999 --> 34:45.999
But I think I'm gonna
go with a Mickey Cohen.

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
- As much as I want everything
to go right tonight,

34:47.999 --> 34:49.999
I can't help
but worry and acknowledge

34:49.999 --> 34:52.999
that there is the chance that
some things might go wrong.

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
- I wanted to order
crab cakes, dang it.

34:54.999 --> 34:55.999
- What'd you get?
Brussels sprouts?

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
- Sandoval is the only
other one at the table

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
that knows what's going on.

34:59.999 --> 35:00.999
I didn't tell anyone else

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
because I didn't want them
anticipating the moment.

35:02.999 --> 35:06.999
And, sh**, I find myself
anticipating the moment.

35:06.999 --> 35:08.999
My best friend tonight
is definitely beer.

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
"I'll have another."

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
- Hey, Brittany.
Here's a formal welcome to L.A.

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
- Thanks.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
- How many hours is that drive?

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
- It was, like, 32 hours.

35:17.999 --> 35:18.999
Without stopping, of course.

35:18.999 --> 35:20.999
- I just can't believe
you did it by yourself.

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
- I--obviously,
I'd love to come.

35:24.999 --> 35:25.999
You know, I wish I could.

35:25.999 --> 35:26.999
- I didn't have room
for anybody to come with me.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.999
- And her car,
when she showed up,

35:28.999 --> 35:30.999
it was--there's no room
for barely even you.

35:30.999 --> 35:31.999
You were like this
at the steering wheel.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
- So where is all
that stuff going?

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
- Actually,
it was great for me.

35:38.999 --> 35:41.999
I refuse to pay a lot
of money on rent.

35:41.999 --> 35:42.999
- Whew.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.999
So anticipation is,
like, peaking.

35:45.999 --> 35:46.999
- When you're a bachelor,

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
that's one thing,
but now you're a couple.

35:48.999 --> 35:49.999
- Right, right.

35:49.999 --> 35:52.999
- I'm just like--

35:52.999 --> 35:54.999
- Girl needs
her closet space.

35:54.999 --> 35:55.999
- Can we start
with some oysters?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.999
- Save the oysters for Hawaii.

35:57.999 --> 35:59.999
I'm saving my liver
and my waistline for Hawaii.

35:59.999 --> 36:01.999
- Yeah, we got to
take it easy this week.

36:01.999 --> 36:02.999
- Yeah.
- Maybe not tonight.

36:02.999 --> 36:04.999
- We have a lot to do next week.

36:04.999 --> 36:07.999
- And then I went
and cleaned out H&M and Zara.

36:07.999 --> 36:08.999
Almost like they're sent
from Hawaii.

36:08.999 --> 36:10.999
Everything in there is,
like, flowered shirts, you know?

36:10.999 --> 36:12.000
Like, Hawaiian shirts.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.999
- So you're gonna look
like a dad?

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
- Oh, my God.
He's gonna look like a tourist.

36:15.999 --> 36:16.999
- I am.

36:16.999 --> 36:17.999
- Brittany, are you
domesticating him?

36:17.999 --> 36:19.000
- I guess.

36:19.999 --> 36:21.999
- You got to teach Britt
the L.A. way, man.

36:21.999 --> 36:22.999
You got--I mean,

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
you wait as long
as you can to get married.

36:24.999 --> 36:27.999
You got to be more selfish.

36:27.999 --> 36:29.999
I have Katie exactly
where I want her.

36:29.999 --> 36:31.999
I mean, she has more or less
given up hope

36:31.999 --> 36:32.999
that we're ever
gonna get engaged.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
- Weren't you supposed
to be married by now?

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
If I can recall, last year?

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
- All right, next subject.

36:37.999 --> 36:38.999
- Is that a crab cake?
- Yeah.

36:38.999 --> 36:40.999
- You should get a crab cake
too, babe.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.999
- That looks good.
- This is the fried chicken one.

36:48.999 --> 36:49.999
- What about the hotel?

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
Is there--is it,
like, on a beach?

36:51.999 --> 36:52.999
- Yes.

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
- Finally got the ring,

36:54.999 --> 36:57.999
came up with the idea,
have orchestrated it,

36:57.999 --> 36:59.999
but the cue is when
they clear the entrees.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.999
- That'll be so fun.

37:01.999 --> 37:02.999
- I want to see Jax try
and ride a horse.

37:02.999 --> 37:06.999
- Bareback naked?

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
- Can we please ride horses?

37:13.999 --> 37:16.999
- I feel my heart rate
just start accelerating.

37:16.999 --> 37:20.999
I can't breathe.
I think it's the vest.

37:20.999 --> 37:23.999
"f***, f***, f***, f***.
Don't f*** this up, man."

37:23.999 --> 37:25.999
- Abercrombie all over again.

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
- Bunch of dudes playing
football in the water naked,

37:27.999 --> 37:28.999
calling each other
Chad and Zach.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.999
- Yeah, I know you
wouldn't normally be standing

37:30.999 --> 37:33.999
on a hood of a junkyard car,
like, stark naked.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.999
For some reason,
it makes sense in this picture.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
I guess it's 'cause
it's black and white.

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
- Yeah, but your hair's parted.

37:39.999 --> 37:41.999
- That makes sense.

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
- It's funny, because
it's something

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
I'm so well-prepared for,

37:45.999 --> 37:49.999
yet that moment before,
it's just terrifying.

37:51.999 --> 37:54.999
- Another?
Yeah, you got it.

37:54.999 --> 37:57.999
- They're oatmeal--blueberries
with butterscotch chips.

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
They are the best thing
I've ever had in my mouth, ever.

38:00.999 --> 38:05.999
No offense, Schwartz.
They're the best thing ever.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.999
- Are you f***ing
sh***ing me right now?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
- What?
- Will you marry me?

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
- Shut the f*** up.
Is he proposing to her?

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
- I see this guy down
on one knee,

38:18.999 --> 38:21.999
and I see the look
on his girlfriend's face.

38:21.999 --> 38:22.999
- Oh, my God.

38:22.999 --> 38:26.999
- Is the universe
rubbing it in my face, dude?

38:26.999 --> 38:27.999
Come on.
- Is this happening?

38:27.999 --> 38:30.999
- Of course, Tom has
to draw attention to it.

38:30.999 --> 38:34.000
I'm trying to not, like,
feel awkward or sad about it.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.999
- If we--

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
You know what, actually?

38:38.999 --> 38:40.999
Actually, you guys--
guys, guys, guys, guys.

38:40.999 --> 38:41.999
- Tom!

38:41.999 --> 38:43.999
- Can I take over?
I'm sorry.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
I'll take it from here.
- Seriously?

38:50.999 --> 38:51.999
- Katie Maloney...

38:53.999 --> 38:54.999
- No, you're not.
- You're the love of my life.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.999
- No, you're not.
- Oh, my God.

38:57.999 --> 38:59.999
- I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

38:59.999 --> 39:00.999
- No, you're not.

39:02.999 --> 39:03.999
No, you're not.

39:13.999 --> 39:14.999
- Will you marry me?

39:14.999 --> 39:16.999
- Oh, my God...

39:18.999 --> 39:20.999
Holy sh**t, dude.

39:20.999 --> 39:21.999
- Are you serious?

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
- Yeah, I love you.
I love you.

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
Wait, you never said yes.

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

39:43.999 --> 39:45.999
- No, you're not.

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999
- I love you.

39:47.999 --> 39:49.999
Wait, you never said yes.

39:53.999 --> 39:55.999
- Of course.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.999
Oh, yes, of course.

40:01.999 --> 40:02.999
- I'm just, like--

40:02.999 --> 40:04.999
oh, my God.

40:06.999 --> 40:10.999
- It's about time!

40:10.999 --> 40:12.999
- I had no idea.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

40:19.999 --> 40:22.999
- I know!
That was awesome!

40:22.999 --> 40:25.999
- I love you, Bubby.

40:25.999 --> 40:26.999
- Like, I knew it was coming,

40:26.999 --> 40:27.999
but I didn't know when.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
- That was good.

40:36.999 --> 40:40.999
- It turns out he was serious.
I'm engaged.

40:40.999 --> 40:41.999
Oh, my God.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
- She was such a bitch
to me today too.

40:45.999 --> 40:47.999
- Oh, my God,
I'm so confused.

40:47.999 --> 40:51.999
- Yay!
- It's my allergies.

40:51.999 --> 40:52.999
I'm definitely not crying.

40:52.999 --> 40:55.999
- Can we get a bottle
of champagne?

40:55.999 --> 40:58.999
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, dude!

40:58.999 --> 41:00.999
You guys,
thanks for being here.

41:00.999 --> 41:01.999
- I'm very proud of him.

41:01.999 --> 41:03.999
I mean, he's stepping up
to the plate.

41:03.999 --> 41:05.999
Another one bites the dust.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
- Bubby, I did a modeling job
with her last week.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.999
- He's been talking about it
since the day I met him, so--

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
- Oh, my God.
- Oscar, thank you so much.

41:11.999 --> 41:12.999
I really appreciate it.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
- How fast was
your heart beating?

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
- Oh, my God, I know.

41:16.999 --> 41:20.999
- It feels better than what
I imagined it would feel like.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
All this time, I thought
he never listened to me,

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
and he listened.

41:24.999 --> 41:25.999
Mom.

41:25.999 --> 41:27.000
- What?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.999
- I woke you up
because I have good news.

41:29.999 --> 41:30.999
- I'm engaged.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.999
- She doesn't believe it.

41:36.999 --> 41:37.999
I'm thinking to myself,

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
"Why didn't I just
do this sooner?"

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
'Cause it feels great.

41:41.999 --> 41:45.000
- Perfect.
- So cute.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.999
- It's going on Instagram.
I'm about to hit Share.

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
It's official.

41:48.999 --> 41:49.999
It's in the world.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
- Special, special thanks
to Tom

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
for letting me steal
some of his birthday thunder.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
- I'm so proud of Schwartz
right now.

41:55.999 --> 41:56.999
- I love you, dude.
- I love you, man.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
It was so awesome, man.

41:58.999 --> 41:59.999
It couldn't have
gone any better.

41:59.999 --> 42:00.999
- Congratulations.

42:00.999 --> 42:02.999
- The four-year
engagement.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
There's a lot of things
that could've went wrong,

42:07.999 --> 42:11.999
but they didn't, and it was
the fairy-tale ending.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
- Lookit.
I got some pep in my step.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
- You do.
You have--

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
You're a very handsome fiancé.

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
- I'm a fiancé now, so--

42:22.999 --> 42:26.999
- Bubba, I'm so impressed.
You did so--

42:26.999 --> 42:27.999
- Want to do a reenactment?

42:27.999 --> 42:31.999
No. Come on. Stop.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
- ♪ It beat, beats for ya ♪

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
♪ It beat, beats for ya ♪

42:35.999 --> 42:39.999
♪ It beat, beats
just for ya ♪

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:41.999 --> 42:43.000
- I got to let some people know

42:43.999 --> 42:45.999
who's coming to Hawaii
and who's not coming to Hawaii.

42:45.999 --> 42:46.999
It's my birthday.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
- What I say goes.

42:48.999 --> 42:50.999
- I love to flirt with Jax,
and I don't know how to stop.

42:50.999 --> 42:52.000
- I just heard you guys
were, like,

42:52.999 --> 42:53.999
whispering in
each other's ears.

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
I'm gonna have to talk
to her about it.

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
- Your presence does make me
feel uncomfortable.

42:57.999 --> 43:00.999
- Your own family has noticed
a change in your personality.

43:00.999 --> 43:01.999
- You guys aren't true friends--

43:01.999 --> 43:02.999
- Okay, this is pointless.

43:02.999 --> 43:04.999
- You don't listen.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
- I'm just excited
to go back to Hawaii.

43:06.999 --> 43:08.999
- I can't believe
I'm about to get on a plane

43:08.999 --> 43:12.999
with these ass****s.

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
