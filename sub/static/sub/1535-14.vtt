WEBVTT

00:02.008 --> 00:03.941
<i>So, tell me about your day--</i>
<i>how's it going</i>

00:03.943 --> 00:05.175
with the particle detector?

00:05.177 --> 00:07.478
Wow! You remember that?

00:07.480 --> 00:09.146
Yeah, I listen
to what you say.

00:09.148 --> 00:10.681
You're building
a particle detector

00:10.683 --> 00:12.516
using superfluid helium.

00:12.518 --> 00:14.518
You know, when you
talk like that,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.021
I want to take you
right here on this table.

00:17.023 --> 00:19.023
And you know
from past experience

00:19.025 --> 00:20.925
this table cannot support
both our weight.

00:22.661 --> 00:24.361
So, how's
the detector going?

00:24.363 --> 00:26.697
Well, it's tricky working
with superfluids.

00:26.699 --> 00:27.932
Whatever container
you put them in,

00:27.934 --> 00:29.333
they kind of
creep up the sides

00:29.335 --> 00:30.834
and crawl out
all on their own.

00:30.836 --> 00:33.237
Kind of like
Sheldon's ant farm.

00:33.239 --> 00:35.906
Exactly, except you don't have
a lunatic running around,

00:35.908 --> 00:39.310
yelling, "I fed you sugar water,
why are you biting me?"

00:40.946 --> 00:43.013
Come on, this is boring-- you
really want to talk about this?

00:43.015 --> 00:43.948
No, I do.

00:43.950 --> 00:45.316
I-I didn't write
"superfluid helium"

00:45.318 --> 00:47.117
on this napkin for nothing.

00:47.953 --> 00:49.253
Okay, well...

00:49.255 --> 00:50.621
This is cool.

00:50.623 --> 00:52.957
Uh, there's a thing called
"superfluid vacuum theory",

00:52.959 --> 00:54.959
where empty space is
imagined as a superfluid

00:54.961 --> 00:56.527
with all of
its qualities--

00:56.529 --> 00:58.796
viscosity, density,
surface tension...

01:00.865 --> 01:03.233
Hey, if you're pausing
for dramatic effect,

01:03.235 --> 01:05.569
I'd keep it moving.

01:05.571 --> 01:07.071
No, no.

01:09.140 --> 01:12.509
People don't talk
about surface tension.

01:12.511 --> 01:15.879
If you imagine our
three-space as the surface

01:15.881 --> 01:18.582
of an N-dimensional
superfluid bubble...

01:18.584 --> 01:21.685
This... is exciting.

01:21.687 --> 01:22.920
This is really exciting.

01:22.922 --> 01:24.054
I have to go
find Sheldon.

01:24.056 --> 01:27.124
Okay, well,
if you find him,

01:27.126 --> 01:28.359
use the kitchen island--

01:28.361 --> 01:30.294
that coffee table will not
support both of you.

01:33.264 --> 01:36.066
Which means a spherical
multidimensional superfluid

01:36.068 --> 01:38.435
shows the same negative-energy
density as space-time.

01:38.437 --> 01:41.238
So what do you think? What do
you think? So what do you think?

01:44.409 --> 01:46.410
Hmm...

01:46.412 --> 01:48.012
What? Is it wrong?

01:48.014 --> 01:49.513
Have you seen it somewhere else?

01:51.816 --> 01:54.018
Hmm...

01:54.853 --> 01:56.120
I know this isn't my area,

01:56.122 --> 01:58.288
and I could never
do the math like you can,

01:58.290 --> 02:00.024
but could this be something...?

02:00.026 --> 02:01.026
Well...

02:03.329 --> 02:06.930
You could have set Newton's
gravitational constant to one.

02:06.932 --> 02:09.299
And, ugh, the whole thing reeks
of blueberry.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.202
You know I can't stand
these scented markers.

02:13.004 --> 02:15.506
No one told you to taste them.

02:16.374 --> 02:18.475
Come on, is-is this
good or not?

02:20.112 --> 02:21.578
It's good.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.347
Really?
I like it.

02:23.349 --> 02:24.748
I think you're on to something.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.050
You do? You're not
messing with me?

02:26.052 --> 02:27.151
Not at all.

02:27.153 --> 02:29.553
In fact,
I have got something

02:29.555 --> 02:30.921
for just such
an occasion.

02:30.923 --> 02:32.022
I was starting to think

02:32.024 --> 02:34.124
I might never get a chance
to give it to you.

02:34.126 --> 02:35.826
Good job.

02:40.665 --> 02:43.067
You're giving me a sticker?

02:43.069 --> 02:44.968
Not just a sticker.

02:44.970 --> 02:48.572
That is a sticker of a kitty
saying, "Me-wow!"

02:50.475 --> 02:52.743
I'm not a preschooler.

02:52.745 --> 02:54.478
Fine, I'll take it back.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.780
I earned this!

03:27.815 --> 03:29.949
You're still awake?

03:29.951 --> 03:32.585
For a man whose
last observation was

03:32.587 --> 03:34.153
our universe may be the surface

03:34.155 --> 03:36.455
of a multidimensional
supercooled liquid,

03:36.457 --> 03:39.792
"you're still awake" seems
like quite the sophomore slump.

03:41.161 --> 03:43.095
You worked out
all the math.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.865
Oh, I did more
than work out all the math.

03:45.867 --> 03:48.301
I wrote a paper.

03:49.469 --> 03:51.370
You wrote a paper
on my idea?

03:51.372 --> 03:54.407
I wrote a paper
on <i>our</i> idea.

03:54.409 --> 03:57.476
When did my idea
become our idea?

03:57.478 --> 03:59.478
When I mixed it with
Sheldony goodness

03:59.480 --> 04:02.848
and cooked it in the
Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

04:04.885 --> 04:06.886
This is good.

04:06.888 --> 04:08.487
Our idea is really good.

04:08.489 --> 04:11.724
Well, the lightbulb in this
oven is ridiculously bright.

04:14.194 --> 04:16.161
You know, if no one's
thought of this, yet,

04:16.164 --> 04:17.463
this could be a big deal.

04:17.464 --> 04:18.930
Only way we'll
know for sure is

04:18.933 --> 04:21.300
if we post it online to
the pre-print server.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.870
I have it ready to go, but I
wasn't gonna do it without you.

04:26.707 --> 04:29.108
Wow, it's all
happening so fast.

04:29.943 --> 04:31.644
Should we just sleep on it?

04:31.646 --> 04:34.313
We could, but we
always run the risk

04:34.315 --> 04:36.315
of someone else beating
us to the punch.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.718
You're sure it's good?

04:38.720 --> 04:41.420
My name is right on
there with yours.

04:41.422 --> 04:44.957
That is a surefire
mark of quality.

04:46.259 --> 04:48.594
That might as well say
"Directed by Joss Whedon".

04:51.665 --> 04:53.366
Okay, partner, let's do it.

04:56.236 --> 04:57.803
Come on.

04:57.805 --> 04:59.739
Click the
mouse with me.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.511
One...

05:05.513 --> 05:07.013
two...

05:07.015 --> 05:08.247
three...

05:08.249 --> 05:09.849
Click.

05:13.186 --> 05:14.320
Well, we did it.

05:14.322 --> 05:16.355
Yes, we did,
my friend.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.490
Is your tongue blue?

05:17.492 --> 05:20.393
I don't want to
talk about it.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.295
Okay, movie night--
what do you want to watch?

05:23.297 --> 05:25.297
Whatever happened
to that ape movie you were in?

05:25.299 --> 05:26.432
Oh, God.

05:26.434 --> 05:27.566
Probably nothing.

05:27.568 --> 05:29.502
I think I saw the director
twirling a sign

05:29.504 --> 05:31.637
outside the Verizon store.

05:31.639 --> 05:33.005
Search for it.

05:33.007 --> 05:34.040
Wha... no.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.007
No! Why?

05:35.009 --> 05:36.308
'Cause it would be
fun to watch.

05:36.310 --> 05:37.877
It would be humiliating.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.446
Well, now we have
two reasons.

05:42.215 --> 05:43.215
They have it.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.183
Please,
can we watch it?

05:44.185 --> 05:45.317
Please?

05:45.319 --> 05:47.720
Fine, but I'm telling you--
it's terrible.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.122
Have you even seen it?
No.

05:50.124 --> 05:51.657
Well, maybe it turned out
better than you think.

05:52.827 --> 05:54.727
Bananas,
get your fresh bananas.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.563
It really didn't.

06:02.335 --> 06:05.971
Sheldon, this is
superfluid helium.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.339
Put this in
your mouth,

06:07.341 --> 06:09.241
your tongue will
freeze and break off.

06:10.977 --> 06:13.813
Does it smell like blueberries?

06:13.815 --> 06:14.815
No.

06:14.816 --> 06:16.882
Then we're probably okay.

06:16.884 --> 06:18.818
Hey, your paper
got mentioned

06:18.820 --> 06:20.319
on the <i>Quantum Diaries</i>
physics blog.

06:20.321 --> 06:21.554
Really?

06:21.556 --> 06:23.222
Wh-What'd they say?

06:23.224 --> 06:24.890
Uh, it's basically
a summary of the theory,

06:24.892 --> 06:26.592
but there's a bunch of positive
comments on the message board.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.928
Let me see,
let me see.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.298
One calls it "insightful
and innovative".

06:32.300 --> 06:34.133
We're insightful
and innovative.

06:34.135 --> 06:36.669
Ooh, nice to meet you,
Mr. Insightful.

06:36.671 --> 06:38.771
Oh, the pleasure is mine,
Mr. Innovative.

06:40.407 --> 06:42.408
Uh, another one says,
"The concept shows

06:42.410 --> 06:44.410
some real out-of-the-box
thinking".

06:44.412 --> 06:46.979
Do you hear that,
Mr. Out-Of-The?

06:46.981 --> 06:50.182
I do, indeed,
Mr. Box-Thinking.

06:50.184 --> 06:51.484
How are you today,

06:51.486 --> 06:54.353
Mr. Can-You-Believe-
These-Jack-Asses?

06:54.355 --> 06:56.655
Just dandy, Mr....

06:56.657 --> 07:00.292
I-Wish-I-Was-
Better-At-Improv.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.461
Read another one.
Okay, okay. Uh...

07:02.463 --> 07:04.997
"The analogy
between space-time

07:04.999 --> 07:08.267
and a supercooled fluid is
either meaningless or... false".

07:08.269 --> 07:12.104
"I wish this blog would
devote itself to real science

07:12.106 --> 07:14.373
"instead of wasting
our time with crackpot,

07:14.375 --> 07:17.510
wannabe theoreticians
in a rush to publish".

07:17.512 --> 07:18.644
Who wrote that?

07:18.646 --> 07:19.945
It's anonymous,

07:19.947 --> 07:22.782
and user name
"General Relativity."

07:22.784 --> 07:25.317
Well... I'm responding to it.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.019
Uh, don't lower yourself
to their level.

07:27.021 --> 07:28.454
Look, I am simply

07:28.456 --> 07:30.990
going to defend our work,
scientist to scientist.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.525
And failing that,

07:32.527 --> 07:34.326
suggest that his mother enjoys
a string

07:34.328 --> 07:37.263
of both human
and non-human lovers.

07:37.265 --> 07:40.466
Sheldon, my name's
on that paper, too.

07:40.468 --> 07:42.034
There's no upside to doing this.

07:42.036 --> 07:43.435
He just left another comment.

07:43.437 --> 07:45.304
What does it say?

07:45.306 --> 07:48.507
"Upon review, I've
changed my mind about

07:48.509 --> 07:49.909
"the Cooper-Hofstadter
hypothesis

07:49.911 --> 07:52.311
"that space-time is like
a superfluid. In fact,

07:52.313 --> 07:55.614
"it's inspired me to come up
with my own theory.

07:55.616 --> 07:57.483
"Maybe space-time is like
two clowns

07:57.485 --> 07:58.784
"with their heads in a bucket,

07:58.786 --> 08:02.755
much like Cooper
and Hofstadter."

08:02.757 --> 08:04.490
Can I respond now?

08:04.492 --> 08:06.125
Do it.

08:06.127 --> 08:09.495
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

08:09.497 --> 08:13.065
I'm about to show this guy
just how horny I can be.

08:17.537 --> 08:19.705
Somebody else do it.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.876
Doctor, please help me.

08:23.878 --> 08:27.713
I think I might be turning
into a killer gorilla.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.516
Why do you think you're turning
into a killer gorilla

08:30.518 --> 08:32.217
and not just a regular gorilla?

08:32.220 --> 08:35.821
Because regular gorillas
are vegetarians,

08:35.823 --> 08:38.123
and I just bit the fingers
off your receptionist!

08:39.393 --> 08:42.628
Okay, we've seen plenty.
No!

08:42.630 --> 08:43.729
Give me the remote.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.298
Careful. She'll bite
your fingers off.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.400
Okay, well, I've been
poking around the internet,

08:48.402 --> 08:51.437
and I think I found something
we'll enjoy watching even more.

08:51.439 --> 08:52.471
What is it?

08:52.473 --> 08:53.572
Oh, just a video

08:53.574 --> 08:55.541
of Bernadette
in a beauty pageant.

08:55.543 --> 08:56.642
What?!

08:56.644 --> 08:58.244
Okay, I learned my lesson.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.479
Making fun of people is wrong!

09:01.248 --> 09:02.815
I haven't learned
my lesson.

09:02.817 --> 09:05.017
Play it! Play it!

09:10.424 --> 09:14.193
Hi. I'm Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski

09:14.195 --> 09:17.730
from Yorba Linda, California.

09:18.798 --> 09:23.002
You look like
a talking cupcake!

09:23.004 --> 09:24.403
And you should pick me

09:24.405 --> 09:27.439
for Miss California Quiznos
1999, because I want to...

09:27.441 --> 09:29.642
Tell you what I want,
what I really really want

09:29.644 --> 09:31.510
I'll tell you what I want,
what I really really want

09:31.512 --> 09:33.679
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna

09:33.681 --> 09:38.851
Really, really, really be
Miss California Quiznos 1999!

09:54.924 --> 09:57.560
Did he respond yet?

09:57.561 --> 09:58.719
Hmm. No, not yet.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.052
Well,

10:00.054 --> 10:01.721
maybe we shouldn't have sunk
to his level.

10:01.723 --> 10:03.422
It wasn't that bad.

10:03.424 --> 10:05.091
Read it back one more time.

10:06.427 --> 10:10.129
"My good sir, we are neither
crackpots nor wannabes.

10:10.131 --> 10:13.032
"In fact, we are
experts in our fields.

10:13.034 --> 10:15.334
"And while you hide
behind your anonymity,

10:15.336 --> 10:17.370
"we stand behind our paper.

10:17.372 --> 10:19.772
And later tonight, your mother".

10:23.143 --> 10:25.244
And you don't think
that's too rough?

10:25.246 --> 10:27.847
We're just <i>standing</i> behind her.

10:27.849 --> 10:30.916
It's not like we're gonna say
"boo" and scare her.

10:33.587 --> 10:36.355
How could you not tell us
you were in beauty pageants?

10:36.357 --> 10:38.157
'Cause it's
embarrassing.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.760
It is; it truly is.

10:42.095 --> 10:43.429
Yeah, well...

10:43.431 --> 10:46.132
Amy writes <i>Little House</i>
<i>on the Prairie</i> fan fiction

10:46.134 --> 10:48.668
about herself
and posts it on the Internet.

10:51.305 --> 10:53.205
No!

10:53.207 --> 10:56.409
Why? What did I do?!

10:56.411 --> 10:58.644
Sorry, I had to get
the spotlight off me,

10:58.646 --> 11:01.414
and tearing down other women
is part of my pageant training.

11:01.416 --> 11:04.116
Okay. We are
reading that right now.

11:04.118 --> 11:05.184
No, please don't.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.353
We got embarrassed
tonight. Come on.

11:07.355 --> 11:08.521
But it's personal.

11:08.523 --> 11:10.222
Why? Is it about you
and Sheldon?

11:10.224 --> 11:11.957
No.

11:12.859 --> 11:14.760
Oh, my God, it's
about her and Sheldon.

11:14.762 --> 11:16.462
It's not about me and Sheldon.

11:16.464 --> 11:20.466
It's about a young woman
in the 1800s named Amelia...

11:20.468 --> 11:22.835
and the time-traveling physicist
named Cooper

11:22.837 --> 11:24.937
she falls in love with.

11:24.939 --> 11:26.939
Please show us?
Please?

11:26.941 --> 11:29.108
No.
You know I'm gonna read it either way.

11:29.110 --> 11:31.010
Good luck finding it.

11:32.246 --> 11:34.113
Amelia and...

11:34.115 --> 11:35.781
the time-trav...

11:35.783 --> 11:38.351
Found it!

11:38.353 --> 11:40.453
"It was just past dawn
on the prairie,

11:40.455 --> 11:41.954
"and like every morning,

11:41.956 --> 11:43.856
"Amelia prepared
to do her chores.

11:43.858 --> 11:46.859
Except something about
<i>this</i> morning felt different."

11:46.861 --> 11:48.327
Why?

11:50.163 --> 11:53.199
<i>Why</i> did it
feel different?

11:54.501 --> 11:57.269
"Maybe it was the first whisper
of winter in the air,

11:57.271 --> 11:59.638
"or maybe it was
the unconscious handsome man

11:59.640 --> 12:01.640
"with porcelain skin
and curious clothing

12:01.642 --> 12:04.443
"she was about to discover
lying in the field.

12:04.445 --> 12:06.045
"A man who would
open her mind

12:06.047 --> 12:07.580
"to new possibilities

12:07.582 --> 12:10.683
and her body to new feelings."

12:15.857 --> 12:20.192
You know, there was a time when
I was alone and had no friends.

12:20.194 --> 12:22.495
I'm starting to miss that.

12:24.931 --> 12:26.599
He still hasn't responded.

12:26.601 --> 12:28.234
What's taking him so long?

12:28.236 --> 12:30.369
Do you really <i>want</i>
him to write back?

12:30.371 --> 12:32.571
Yeah, I do.
No matter how he responds,

12:32.573 --> 12:36.842
I am going to destroy him
with a picture of a bored cat

12:36.844 --> 12:39.612
saying, "Oh, <i>really?"</i>

12:43.950 --> 12:45.818
Me-wow.

12:47.921 --> 12:49.021
What are you doing?

12:49.023 --> 12:51.924
I've, uh, created some
other user accounts

12:51.926 --> 12:54.827
so I can post positive
comments about their paper.

12:54.829 --> 12:57.696
"This wee li'l bairn
of a theory

12:57.698 --> 12:59.698
nearly blew my kilt off"?

12:59.700 --> 13:02.868
No. You have to read it
how Dr. Angus McDoogal

13:02.870 --> 13:05.438
of the University
of Edinburgh would.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.640
"This wee li'l bairn of a theory

13:07.642 --> 13:10.276
nearly blew me kilt off."

13:12.045 --> 13:14.079
He wrote back!

13:14.081 --> 13:18.050
"Cooper and Hofstadter resorting
to juvenile attempts at humor

13:18.052 --> 13:21.353
"is proof they have nothing to
back up their ridiculous paper.

13:21.355 --> 13:22.922
"It should come
as no surprise

13:22.924 --> 13:26.759
"given they work at Cal Tech,
essentially a technical school,

13:26.761 --> 13:30.329
where even the physicists
are basically engineers."

13:30.331 --> 13:32.598
"Engineers"!

13:34.134 --> 13:37.136
Do you know
how insulting that is?

13:37.138 --> 13:38.971
Yes.

13:38.973 --> 13:41.707
Guys, this person's
just going out of their way

13:41.709 --> 13:43.542
to get a rise out of you.

13:43.544 --> 13:45.811
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.
Yeah, well,

13:45.813 --> 13:47.746
all the other comments
said really nice things.

13:47.748 --> 13:49.515
Focus on those.
Yeah.

13:49.517 --> 13:51.817
Dr. Dmitri Plancovik

13:51.819 --> 13:53.752
of Moscow
University said,

13:53.754 --> 13:55.721
"Dis paper great.

13:55.723 --> 13:58.624
I love it more
than 'wodka.".

14:00.026 --> 14:02.261
See? Better
with the accent.

14:02.263 --> 14:03.596
And...

14:03.598 --> 14:04.864
send.

14:04.866 --> 14:06.332
What did you write?

14:06.334 --> 14:07.733
I'm done hiding from bullies.

14:07.735 --> 14:09.635
I'm taking this
into the real world.

14:09.637 --> 14:11.871
What does that mean?
I told him we'll meet him

14:11.873 --> 14:13.739
face-to-face anytime, anywhere.

14:13.741 --> 14:15.774
Are you crazy?
You don't know who this person is.

14:15.776 --> 14:16.842
Delete that!
Come on, Sheldon!

14:16.844 --> 14:17.977
Oh, okay,

14:17.979 --> 14:20.179
okay, calm down.

14:21.849 --> 14:23.816
It's him!

14:23.818 --> 14:26.118
He's trying to video chat.

14:29.689 --> 14:33.325
Perhaps I shouldn't have
taken this into the real world.

14:33.327 --> 14:35.461
Oh, <i>really?</i>

14:38.098 --> 14:40.065
"'Time travel?
I don't understand,'

14:40.067 --> 14:42.067
"said Amelia.
Cooper stared at her.

14:42.069 --> 14:46.205
'Which rd don't you
understand, time or travel?'"

14:46.207 --> 14:50.075
Wow, even in your fantasies
Sheldon's kind of exhausting.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.112
He's like that
in the beginning,

14:53.114 --> 14:54.513
so she can change him.

14:54.515 --> 14:56.115
It's called good writing.

14:57.017 --> 14:59.118
And wishful thinking.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.619
"It stung Amelia

15:00.621 --> 15:02.388
"when he spoke to her this way.

15:02.390 --> 15:03.822
"In her little
one-room schoolhouse,

15:03.824 --> 15:05.591
"she was always
the smartest student,

15:05.593 --> 15:07.259
"regularly besting the boys
in her class,

15:07.261 --> 15:09.528
"but this was no boy
in front of her--

15:09.530 --> 15:10.763
"this was a man.

15:10.765 --> 15:12.665
Here we go.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.166
"Cooper told Amelia

15:14.168 --> 15:15.834
"about all the strange
and incredible things

15:15.836 --> 15:17.336
"the future would hold,
like computers

15:17.338 --> 15:18.871
"and living past 30.

15:18.873 --> 15:21.006
"He asked her
if she had any questions.

15:21.008 --> 15:22.608
"All she longed to ask was

15:22.610 --> 15:24.944
"if his heart was beating
as fast as hers,

15:24.946 --> 15:26.111
"but she was too afraid

15:26.113 --> 15:27.479
to hear the answer."

15:27.481 --> 15:28.881
Oh, Amelia.

15:28.883 --> 15:30.916
"So instead she asked if,
in the future,

15:30.918 --> 15:34.520
Montana ever became a state."

15:37.324 --> 15:41.527
In the 1800s
that was considered flirting.

15:42.696 --> 15:45.965
I'm so sick of people
being mean on the Internet.

15:45.967 --> 15:48.500
Well, I think the anonymity
makes everyone feel like

15:48.502 --> 15:51.403
they can say things
they'd never say to your face.

15:51.405 --> 15:53.172
Interesting.

15:53.174 --> 15:55.207
I can't think of a single thing

15:55.209 --> 15:58.010
I wouldn't say
to someone's face.

15:58.012 --> 16:01.480
Never noticed that about you.

16:02.582 --> 16:05.951
You know what? A-At least
you guys <i>did</i> something.

16:05.953 --> 16:08.020
You know, you-you had a theory,

16:08.022 --> 16:09.388
you wrote a paper,

16:09.390 --> 16:11.290
you made
an actual contribution.

16:11.292 --> 16:15.027
All guys like this do is just
stand on other people's work.

16:15.862 --> 16:18.397
He's right.

16:18.399 --> 16:21.667
I say we call this person back.

16:21.669 --> 16:24.203
We've got no reason to hide.

16:25.605 --> 16:27.840
All right, do it.
Call him.

16:27.842 --> 16:30.576
Let's find out what this loser's
ever accomplished.

16:34.114 --> 16:36.315
Click it with me.

16:37.384 --> 16:38.884
One, two, three...

16:38.886 --> 16:40.352
Click.
click.

16:43.024 --> 16:44.923
Well, hello there.

16:44.925 --> 16:47.493
Professor Hawking?

16:47.495 --> 16:51.363
Oh, brother, you should see
the look on your faces.

16:53.199 --> 16:55.601
You really
didn't like our paper?

16:55.603 --> 16:58.303
I like your paper very much.

16:58.305 --> 17:00.539
The premise is intriguing.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.976
Then why are you
attacking us?

17:03.978 --> 17:06.744
If you were sitting in a chair
for 40 years,

17:06.747 --> 17:08.781
you'd get bored, too.

17:10.349 --> 17:11.916
Anyway,

17:11.919 --> 17:13.285
got to go.

17:13.287 --> 17:17.289
I promised to help the neighbor
kid with his math homework.

17:18.491 --> 17:20.092
Ciao.

17:22.962 --> 17:25.763
Stephen Hawking
liked our paper.

17:26.867 --> 17:29.902
Said the premise
is intriguing.

17:29.904 --> 17:31.804
Good to see you again,

17:31.806 --> 17:34.973
Mr. Stephen-Hawking-
Liked-Our-Paper.

17:36.443 --> 17:40.379
And you as well,
Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.

17:40.381 --> 17:44.316
How do you do, Mr. I'll-
Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?

17:45.151 --> 17:48.754
Yeah, you keep
setting me up for failure.

17:51.324 --> 17:52.558
"With a heavy heart,

17:52.560 --> 17:54.827
"Amelia stood before
the newly repaired time machine.

17:54.829 --> 17:57.362
She regretted giving Cooper
the part he needed."

17:57.364 --> 18:01.133
Because <i>she</i> wanted <i>him</i>
to give <i>her</i> the part <i>she</i> needed.

18:02.869 --> 18:04.303
Okay, that's enough.
What?

18:04.305 --> 18:07.005
No! I really want to know
what happens-- and Bernadette

18:07.007 --> 18:10.008
really, really, really wants
to know what happens.

18:11.311 --> 18:13.278
You're just making fun of me.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.013
I was just kidding.
I'm sorry.

18:15.015 --> 18:16.682
And the story's
really good!

18:16.684 --> 18:18.450
No, it is!
Does he stay?

18:18.452 --> 18:22.454
Do they kiss?
Does she find out about Montana?

18:23.389 --> 18:24.389
Please?

18:24.391 --> 18:25.991
Fine.

18:28.294 --> 18:30.429
"As Cooper prepared to depart,

18:30.431 --> 18:33.031
"tears filled Amelia's eyes.

18:33.033 --> 18:36.735
"He took her hand in his
and said, 'I can't stay,

18:36.737 --> 18:38.771
"but I will never forget you.'

18:38.773 --> 18:41.774
"He brushed his fingers
against her cheek,

18:41.776 --> 18:44.409
"then quickly stepped
into the machine.

18:44.411 --> 18:46.678
"'Please don't go,'
she whispered.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.680
"But it was too late.

18:48.682 --> 18:50.749
"The engine hummed to life.

18:50.751 --> 18:52.851
But they didn't even kiss.

18:52.853 --> 18:54.520
"She turned away,

18:54.522 --> 18:56.221
"wiping her eyes.

18:56.223 --> 18:57.790
"She couldn't bear to watch

18:57.792 --> 19:00.993
"her one chance at true love
disappear forever.

19:00.995 --> 19:04.396
"Then... she felt a strong
hand on her shoulder

19:04.398 --> 19:05.697
"spin her around.

19:05.699 --> 19:07.099
"It was Cooper.

19:08.102 --> 19:10.669
Yes!

19:10.671 --> 19:13.005
"'What about the future?'
asked Amelia.

19:13.007 --> 19:17.109
"He looked deeply into her eyes
and whispered,

19:17.111 --> 19:19.545
"'There is no future
without you.'

19:19.547 --> 19:21.814
"He pulled her in close.

19:21.816 --> 19:24.650
"She began to
tremble all over.

19:24.652 --> 19:27.019
She felt his warm breath..."

19:27.021 --> 19:28.687
You will not believe
what Stephen Hawking just said.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.556
- Get out!
- Not now!

19:45.161 --> 19:48.063
Is the water warm enough?

19:48.066 --> 19:51.868
Given the fact that you took
the time to build a wood fire,

19:51.870 --> 19:54.270
draw the water from
the well and heat it,

19:54.272 --> 19:56.205
it would be rude
to complain.

19:58.208 --> 20:01.811
But since you asked,
it's a little nippy.

20:01.813 --> 20:03.813
I can fix that.

20:08.952 --> 20:13.289
I couldn't help but notice
your unusual undergarments.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.458
They're not undergarments.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.460
They're Underoos.

20:19.430 --> 20:21.297
Where I come from,
they're known as

20:21.299 --> 20:23.933
"underwear that's fun to wear."

20:25.135 --> 20:28.538
And what's the significance
of the spider?

20:28.540 --> 20:31.240
Oh, that represents
Spider-Man.

20:31.242 --> 20:34.477
He does whatever
a spider can.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.549
There's a lot of rhyming
in the future, isn't there?

20:39.551 --> 20:41.217
<i>You're right.</i>

20:41.219 --> 20:43.553
This is even weirder
than I thought.

20:43.555 --> 20:45.721
You want me to
stop reading?

20:45.723 --> 20:47.356
Are you kidding?
No, no.

20:48.425 --> 20:52.028
"As he stood for
Amelia to dry him..."

20:56.633 --> 20:59.001
So, tell me, Cooper...

20:59.003 --> 21:03.739
are the ways of physical love
different in the future?

21:03.741 --> 21:05.208
Yeah, okay, I'm good.
