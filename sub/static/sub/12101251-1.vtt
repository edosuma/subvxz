02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
-

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
-

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
-

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Check it's tight.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Close your hand.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
-Feel good?
-Good.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You made it.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Always rely on Cole Young.
Human punching bag.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
-Who am I fighting?
-Fighting?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
No, no, Cole.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Fighting requires both
attacking and defending,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
You should try it sometime.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Now don't get sensitive.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
You fight Ramirez.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
He's, uh... Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
He's experienced, fast,
a good fighter.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Who's your cornerman?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
You're fucking serious?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
find someone else
who'll do this in

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
You're sticking around
for this one?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
You know I don't watch him
fight anymore.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah, well. Give the people
a good show, huh?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Or they won't
stick around either.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Throw your uppercut!

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Ah!

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Come on!

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Don't tap out!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Done! Done!

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Pack it in.
- Yes!

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
The prophecy
is upon us,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
which means we could lose
the tenth tournament.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
There is
no prophecy.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Hanzo is a ghost.
I killed him centuries ago.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Winning Mortal Kombat
cannot be left to chance.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
There will be no tournament,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
because there'll be
no opposition left to fight.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
We will already
be victorious.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
Go now and kill Earth Realm's
champions, Bi-Han.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
I am no longer Bi-Han.
I am Sub-Zero.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Damn, Young.
You're a hell of

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
-Yeah, you too.
-Respect.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
All right.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
-Ready to go?
- In a sec.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
What do you got there?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
It's a string bracelet.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
You just made this?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
That's pretty cool.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Want me to put it on?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
My hand.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Now, we got one each.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
You're sure you're okay?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Guess I should have thrown
the uppercut, huh?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Cole Young.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
The man that took the belt
from Eddie Tobias.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, that was
a long time ago.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Have me met?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
No.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Name's Jax.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Nice to meet you, Jax.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
You could've won today,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
had you controlled
the cage.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Told you so.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
She's smart.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
All right, well,
time to go eat, yeah?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
One more thing, champ.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
That dragon logo you got...
I, I dig that, man.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It's unique.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Where'd you get it from?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
He was born with it.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
-What do you mean?
-It's a birthmark.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
You serious?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Pretty cool. Show him.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Well, ain't that something.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Nice chatting with you.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
See you around, champ.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
-Hey.
-Hi, Mom.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Still in one piece.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
How'd it go?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
He was this close
to beating him.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
-This close.
-Yes.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
You sure you're okay?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Standing.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
-Let's go order.
-Yeah.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Got my eyes
on him right now.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
He's got the mark,
I saw it.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
He's with his family.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Ally.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Come take a look at this.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
It's snowing.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
But it's July.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
-Emily!
- Emily!

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Get in the truck, Cole!

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Now!

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Come on, come on.
-Move, move, move, move.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Blade, I got him.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I'll see you at base
at 2300.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
What the fuck is that thing?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Funny, that didn't sound
much like thanks

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Whatever that was
back there,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
it's after both of us. Look.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
That's, that's impossible.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
It's not a birthmark, Cole.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
-It means you've been chosen.
-Chosen, for what?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
-To fight.
-You got the wrong person,

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
I'm not the fighter
that I used to be, okay.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
No, shit.
But they don't have

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
So, like it or not Cole,
you're the guy.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
As long as you got that marking
they're coming for you,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
and they will kill
whoever they have to,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
to get to you.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Take the truck.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Get your family to safety.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Cole?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
You need to get
to Gary, Indiana.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
Find Sonya Blade,
806 West Washington Boulevard.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Are you sure?
We can take him out together.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
You want your family
on a fucking slab

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Now get out of here.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Hold on tight, guys.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
So you wanna play
hide and seek.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Done six tours, motherfucker.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
She's finally asleep.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I should go.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
You'll be safe here, Ally.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
You heard what Jax said.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
That thing is hunting
people with the marking.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
It's after me.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
And if I stay here
and it shows up,

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
it could kill us all.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I'm not gonna let that happen.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Jax could have killed it. I...

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
We have to be sure.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
The name he gave me,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Sonya Blade,

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
hopefully,
she'll have some answers.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Master.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Sub-Zero tracked and killed

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
another one
of Earth's champions.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
But another has escaped.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Have our assassins
double the efforts.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
What of Lord Raiden?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
If he discovers
we're breaking rules

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
set in stone
by the Elder Gods--

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Leave the Elder Gods to me.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
We didn't win
nine straight tournaments

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
by following the rules.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Mileena, let's finish this.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Send in
the reptilian, Syzoth.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
-What you doing here?
-Wait.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I'm looking for Sonya Blade.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Jax sent me.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
-Where is it?
-Where's what?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
The marking.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
I'm Sonya.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Jax hasn't checked in.
Where is he?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
He stayed behind
to fight.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Close the door.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Jax, where are you?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Come on.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
You guys are military?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Special Forces.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Holy... What is this?

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
We needed a safe place
to run our operation.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Well, this looks,
uh, pretty safe.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Looks like you're ready
for anything.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
This is where we keep

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
all we've learned
about the dragon markings.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
First learned about this
seven years ago.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Jax and I were on a mission
in Brazil

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
to capture a wanted fugitive.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
When we got there,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
the target
had superhuman abilities.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Tore through our unit
in seconds.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
The target had the same
marking you do, Cole.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
When Jax finally took it down

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
the dragon marking transferred
directly onto his skin.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
I spent years
trying to figure out

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
It seems
that throughout history,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
different cultures
all over the world,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
they reference
a great tournament.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
My research shows
that there's realms and species

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
that we didn't
even know existed.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
That dragon marking,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
it signifies
that you've been chosen

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
to fight for Earth.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's an invitation...

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
to fight for something known

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
as Mortal Kombat.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Did you make that last part up?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
It just kind
of sounds like you made it up.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I mean, and look,
they spelled it wrong.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Hey, you listen to me.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I think there's another
tournament coming.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
That's why you're here.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
That is why Jax
and I have been tracking you

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
because we need to find
every last champion

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
before it's too late.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And FYI, most of them
are dead already.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
There's more to this, Cole.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I know it.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
I swear to God, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I hate to interrupt
your bullshit, blondie.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
But I gotta piss again.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
What is this?
You have a visitor.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Careful, he bites.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Oh, hello, sunshine.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Who are you?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
-He's Kano.
-Kano?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Kano, what?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Kano, none of your
fucking business.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Was that Russian?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Do I sound Russian to you,
you fucking idiot?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
He's a mercenary
with The Black Dragon clan.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Arms dealer, drug runner,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
murder for hire,

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
scum of the Earth.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I also give
really good foot massages.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
You have a marking.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Actually, that's kind of
a funny story.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You want to tell him?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I was tracking
another champion.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I was lucky enough
to find Kano here instead.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Right after he slit
the guy's throat.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
You know, next time
be more punctual.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
You were never chosen.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Fate has better standards
than you.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Lucky for you
I don't have any standards.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Let's see
if you're a natural blonde.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Not bad.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Almost felt that one.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
What about you?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
-Where's your marking?
-I don't have one.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Come on.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Hey, hey, new guy, new guy.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Get me out of here.
I could help you.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Just sit tight.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I was about to go for a stroll,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
but maybe I'll stick around,
you fucking idiots.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
-

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
What the fuck was that?

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
That was my knife, too!

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Fucking poetry.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Where is it?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
-Where?
-Shh.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Did you shoot it?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I thought I clipped it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Sonya, are you okay?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
All right. I'm out of here.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Kano, use the flare!

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
There you are.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Knife.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Kano wins.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
You fucking beauty.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Fucking A,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
years of research
just destroyed.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
So do you believe me now?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Yeah. What's the plan?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
There is none.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Oh, gee.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Make yourself at home.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Yeah, I have.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Oh, by the way,
you beer's shit,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
and you're almost out of it.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
What are you doing?

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Just working on
a Kano graphic novel.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I fancy myself
a bit of an artist.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
He's a psychopath.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
All the best artists
are a little twisted, mate.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Well,

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
I'm off.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
You're trying to get
to Raiden's temple, aren't you?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
That should be fun.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
You know where that is?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
What's Raiden's temple?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Yeah, used to run
guns through there.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
The locals
wouldn't shut the fuck up--

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Legends say
champions used to train there

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Ah, for fuck sake.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
No one knows where it is.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Well, they do now.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
-Excuse me.
-Where is it?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Uh, you got a pen?
You want to write this down?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Get fucked.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
'Cause I'm not gonna help you.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
You kidnapped me.
You tied me up.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
You threw a knife
through my fucking leg,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
on purpose.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
And then that lizard thing
took off half my face.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Lucky for me,
you can hardly notice it.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
So yeah,
it's a hard pass for me

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
on the helping you thing.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
And get out of
me fucking way.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Okay.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
There you go.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Everyone's got a price.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
-Name yours.
-You can't afford me.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Two million.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
That's good.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
You living in this shit hole

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
and you got
two million dollars.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Pig's ass.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I have lived here
my whole life.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
You piece of shit.
You watch your mouth.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Two million dollars.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Yeah. No, fuck you.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Fuck it. Three million.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
That's my final offer.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
And anything,
I find inside that temple

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I keep, no fucking splitsies.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Plus,
if you're bullshitting me,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I'll fucking kill you.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
No skin off my sack.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Great.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
-Sounds like we got a deal.
-

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I was gonna head there anyway.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, fucking idiot.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
How you planning
on getting us there?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Oh, I got a friend
with a plane.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
-You got friends?
-Eh, fuck you, pretty boy.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
I'm a popular guy.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Everyone loves me.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Oh, bloody garden gnomes,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
they give me the creeps.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
You're gonna give that guy
three million dollars?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Fuck, no.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
I live in this shit hole.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
You think
I got three million dollars?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
There I was
trying to shove

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
this guy's nuts
down his throat.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And all I kept thinking about

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
is what should I get
for me mum for Christmas?

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Your mom's been dead
for 30 fucking years, mate.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Kid can dream. Can't he?

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Hey, you were out of it.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
You okay?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
-Yeah.
-All right.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Thank you for flying Air Kano,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I know you had
fuck all choices.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Tray tables up.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Time to jump out
of this shit box.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Come on, let's go.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
First time?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Yeah. What gave it away?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
You'll be okay.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Just gotta jump,
count to three,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
pull this side.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
All right. Simple. But how--

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
-Well, do or die, princess.
-

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
-What?
-You're fucking kidding me.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
So how close are we?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Twenty-seven,
twenty-eight K's.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
What?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Maybe thirty to be safe.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Straight up, thirty-two, eh?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
We say thirty-five
there'll be no surprises.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Oh, shit.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Fuck this. I need a break.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
- You just took a break.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Too many beers, huh?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Give me that GPS.
I'm taking point.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Ah, let's look
at the score board, shall we?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I got us the plane.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
I know how to find

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
your precious little mountain
retreat or whatever it is.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
I killed the lizard man.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
Huh? Any of you rip
anyone's heart out? Hey.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I think I know
what's going on here.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
You're jealous, girlie,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
of me little marking.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Hey, I'm talking to you.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
If you want it so much,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
all you got to do is kill me.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Take it.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Now, come on.
What do you say?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
You want to dance?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
-It's your blood.
-Attagirl.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Hmm.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Go on then, take it.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
You're so close.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Just take it. Take it!

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Nah.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah, that's why
you don't have one of these.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
You don't have
the mongrel in you.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
You good?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
At last.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Okay, that's far enough,
MC Hammer.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
I'm not your enemy.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
I'm Liu Kang from
the Shaolin Order of Light.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
You're one of
the champions.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Yes, from Earthrealm.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Finally, you have come
to seek out Raiden's--

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Fuck the temple.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
Wait... You just shot
a fireball out of your hand.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
How'd you do that?

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
Hang on.
Hang the fuck on.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
Does that mean I'm gonna get
superpowers at any point?

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
It does, doesn't it?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
-There's much to learn.
-The fuck.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
But not here.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Follow me.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Hey, David Copperfield.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Just teach me
how you do it.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
There it is...

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
what you've been
searching for.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
It wasn't always
like this.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
For thousands of years,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
this temple was a holy place
of worship.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
It is essential that
we begin your training

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
This doesn't feel like
a tournament.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
So far
it feels like an ambush.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
We don't have much time.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
We will not see
another full moon

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
before the tournament begins.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Come, come. Through here.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Now what?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
You're gonna
make a door appear

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Oh.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
I'll give you that.
It's pretty good.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Wow.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
I knew it.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
It's all real.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
These murals are
the living history

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Now
this one really speaks to me.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
- This is Outworld.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Yes, the most brutal...

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
and murderous
of all the realms.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Our greatest enemy.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
-

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
We must
start training now.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
Before our mortal enemies from
the Outworld come for us.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
The fate of Earthrealm
is in our hands.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
There are not many of us
with the marking left.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
So you must train harder,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
and faster.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Because if you fail
to discover your inner power,

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
you will never defeat
your opponent.

44:44.000 --> 44:49.000
They will ravage everything
you hold dear.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
There will be no mercy.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
You must fight
without question.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
The Dragon has swallowed
many before us.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Now put that back.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Put what back?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Jax! Hey, Jax.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
Oh, God.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
It has been
my charge to gather

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
all the champions of Earth.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
By the time I found Jax,
I was too late.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Well, is he gonna live?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
The ice...

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
It cauterized his wounds.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
We've sourced every realm

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
to find a way to heal him.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
-What can I do?
-Be patient.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Give them time
to do their work.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
We must go.
He awaits.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
The great protector,
Lord Raiden.

46:22.000 --> 46:29.000
My lord, I've gathered
the remaining

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
This is what
I have to work with?

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
You are in no physical
or mental shape to fight.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
You don't even have a marking.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
All right, hang on.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
What about me, Gandalf,
where's my fortune cookie jar--

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
-Powerless, arrogant.
-

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
The time has long passed.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Our enemies have claimed
nine straight victories.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
One more victory
and Outworld will gain control

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
and Shang Tsung will enslave
the entire human race.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Sorry, what did I miss?

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
They tried
to kill my family.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Help us.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
There's nothing for you here,

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
only death.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Well, I'm willing to die
for my family.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Let's see if you have
what it takes.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
-

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
The time has come
to end this.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Take whatever trophies
you desire...

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
-but their souls are mine.
- Silence!

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
I've come to claim your world.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
You're too late, Raiden.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
It is forbidden
to claim victory until

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
You are correct, Thunder God.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
The conflict outside
of Mortal Kombat

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
-Besides the other gods

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I have come for your souls.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
You will leave this place
at once, sorcerer.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
These are your champions?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Kill them.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
-

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
You think these tricks
will protect you forever?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Only a matter of time.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
All right.
Just circling back

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Think I get it now.
It's kind of like

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
You never know
what you're gonna get.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
Is it gonna be
lightning, huh?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Could be shit. Could be, uh...
Could be a frisbee hat.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
No offense, whoever you are.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
The name is Kung Lao.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Descendant of
the Great Kung Lao.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
The grand champion
of the Order of Light.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Never heard of him.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Listen carefully.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Your training has begun.
Come.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Your inner power
comes from your arcana,

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
a gift from the marking
of the Dragon.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
The point of your training is
for you to unlock that power.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
Without it, defeating Outworld
will be impossible.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
Kung Lao and I have discovered
our arcana.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
In the fight pit,
you'll discover yours.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
You may enter.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Let's do the damn thing.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I want your fireballs.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
-There is no guarantee--
-So, Liu,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
what else is gonna
shoot out of my hands?

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Hey, do you
ever shut up?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You're welcome to
stay with us, Miss Blade.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
But the training area
is for the chosen ones only.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Fucking whoops.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Well, hang on.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
We wouldn't be here
without her.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
She's one of us.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
A fighter without
a marking can never achieve

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
And a fighter without an arcana
is a liability to the others.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Yeah, liability.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
All right. Bye, bye, blondie.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
All right, guys.
Little less of this.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Little more of this.
Come on.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Be still and listen.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Fuckin' hell.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Jax.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
I'm here.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Hi, buddy.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
You just lay down.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
What happened?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
All you can do now
is test your might.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
We have no time to lose.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
You must unlock your arcana.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
In Mortal Kombat,
talent will only get you

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
No, that was great. Really.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Good stuff.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
You know, maybe your arcana
is getting your ass kicked

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
Fight!

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
No Harry Potter shit,
all right?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Cute.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Real cute.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Let's see.
Throwing down again?

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Is that the only move
you know, mate?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
- Fuck.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
Yeah, yeah.
Put a fucking shirt on,

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
It seems as though
we have our work

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
I was just warming up.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Let me see your wound.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Liu...

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
How do I find my arcana?

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
It must come
from your soul.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Whatever it is
that drives you.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
So how did you find
your arcana?

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
Unlike Kung Lao,
I was just a worthless stray.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
For reasons beyond my ken,

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
Master Bo' Rai Cho found me
half dead in the gutter

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
-and brought me
to the Wu Shi Academy.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
There, I was given a purpose.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
A brother...

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Kung Lao.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And I met Lord Raiden.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Kung Lao and I
have served together.

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
Upon graduation,
I was given a name of a man.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
He was a purveyor
of rare things.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Children.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
Orphans like me.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
He had a marking,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
so I chose to
take it from him.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
And in that moment,
my arcana came forth.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
-

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Come on, Major.
I've seen better than that.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Again. Again. Again!

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
-Come on, you got this.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
These don't work.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
These are not me.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
I'm useless.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Why even bring me here?

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
I can't help.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
My first day of training...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
We had to run 20 miles.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Thought I was gonna die.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
I wanted to quit,

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
but all I ever wanted
was to be accepted by you...

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
as an elite fighter.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
You remember what you told me?

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
How do we keep going?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And you proved to yourself
that you can do this or...

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
regret it for the rest
of your life.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Are you trying to tell me
something, soldier?

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Get off your fucking ass,
Major.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Miss Sonya, sit, please.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
-Ah, thank you.
- Eat.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Cole, how's your arm?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It's healing up.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Eat more, heal fast.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
More training tomorrow.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
You're fucking
kidding me, aren't you?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Fucking hell.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Is he on our side?

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Those are great, mate.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
They make those
in men's sizes?

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Top knot, at the end.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
What's his name?
Kung Pao.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Pass us some fucking egg roll,
would you?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Your ears painted on, mate?
Egg roll.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
There you go.
Good boy.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
-

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Maybe you should lay off
the egg rolls,

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
seeing how you wouldn't be
ready to fight

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
if you had 100 days to train.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I'll dumb it down
for you.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Fat, lazy pig.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
What did you say?

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Terrible fighter.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Zero skill.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
You got a death wish, mate?

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Combat takes intelligence.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
But you...

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
You're like a dog.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
A dog who fails
his training classes.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
Well, how about I
take that stupid fucking

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
shove it so far up your ass,
you start speaking Spanish.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
How does that sound?

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
You can try.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
I just fucking might.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Let me ask you this.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Why would you
jeopardize the goodwill

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
of the only chance
of your survival?

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Princess, why don't you
try being one of them

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
No, no, you misunderstand.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
He is here to save you

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
because you cannot
save yourself.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
-Oh, fuck, here we go.
-You're like...

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
an aggressive little bunny.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
-Soft and useless.
-

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Angry mentally, physically.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
You should be on your knees
before this man.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
I've a better idea.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
How about you two
get on your knees

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
and take turns
sucking my sack?

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Do you have
any fucking idea

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I'm wanted in over
35 countries for shit,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
you fucking ballerinas
couldn't even imagine.

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000
-You're angry.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.000
Oh! Fucking nothing
gets by you, does it?

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000
Good.

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000
You should be.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:09.000
You failure.

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:12.000
Failure?

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.000
Fucking failure?

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.000
Let me educate you,
motherfucker. I'm Kano.

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000
I'm the Black fucking Dragon.

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.000
And who are you two, huh?

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000
You're some fucking
cave-dwelling hippy,

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000
twirling his anal beads,

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000
taking orders
from this Wu Shu wanker,

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000
who wears
a hubcap as a helmet.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:32.000
Now, sit down!

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000
Shut up and pass me
a fucking egg roll.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000
That was it, wasn't it?

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000
Laser beam!

1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000
It's better than fireballs,
you pussy.

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000
Come on, Kano.

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000
I knew I'd get mine first.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.000
We are running
out of time, Cole.

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000
Focus on what you can't deny.

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.000
Find the truth in you.

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000
The pain.

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.000
It's the ultimate catalyst.

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000
-Again.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa... Hold on.

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000
Does it have to be him? I--

1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000
You know, I see a little bit
of arcana there.

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.000
Give me one more crack at it.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000
Focus on the pain, Cole.

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000
-I'm focusing,
nothing's happening. It hurts--

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.000
Again.

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000
Yeah, you're right.
Nothing's happening.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:57.000
You're as lazy, ya?

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000
What are you looking at?

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.000
They're beautiful.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000
You're a lucky man.

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000
Thanks.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000
You have failed
to find your arcana.

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000
Without it, you are a liability
to the others.

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000
So where did this come from?

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000
And why am I
the only champion that had

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.000
Your marking comes
from your lineage, Cole.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000
Lineage?

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000
I'm an orphan
from the south side of Chicago.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:48.000
You're a descendant of
one of the greatest ninjas

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.000
Hanzo Hasashi.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.000
He was murdered along
with his wife and eldest son

1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000
by the same assassin
that hunts you now.

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.000
Sub-Zero.

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:07.000
The moment he died,
Hanzo descended into

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.000
the furthest reaches of hell,

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000
endlessly searching
for revenge.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000
But his bloodline lived on.

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000
I rescued Hanzo's
only surviving child...

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000
and hid her in the one place

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000
he wouldn't think to find her.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000
For centuries,
the Hasashi marking

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000
has passed down
through your ancestors.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:32.000
I had a hope the power
in your bloodline

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000
Now I know that's not the case.

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000
Go, be with your family.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:49.000
Cole, do not give up on this.

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000
I'm sorry.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.000
Welcome.

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000
The great hunter, Nitara.

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000
She is beautiful, isn't she?

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000
Yeah. That screech
is a real turn on.

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:53.000
My loyal warriors, Kabal,
General Reiko,

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.000
I have seen the so-called
champions of Earthrealm,

1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:00.000
and they're no match
for all of you.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000
We are on
the precipice of victory

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.000
and taking Earthrealm forever.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000
But we must strike now.

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000
Raiden has prevented entry
into his temple.

1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000
I must find a way
to bring his shield down

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.000
in order to obliterate
our opposition.

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.000
I think I can help.

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000
Did you see a guy down there?

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000
A complete fucking asshole.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000
Answers to Kano.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:24.000
-Kano.
-Yeah.

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000
He's the reason I live
in an iron lung.

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:30.000
He's a low life,
piece of shit scumbag.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:31.000
You're going to love him.

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000
Prince Goro.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000
It is an honor
to have Shokan blood

1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000
Now we shall end this prophecy
once and for all.

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.000
Well, well, well.

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:14.000
You backstabbing, two-faced
ugly motherfucker.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.000
-Kabal.
-Hey, Kano.

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:20.000
It's been a while.

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.000
You getting
enough sleep, mate?

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:24.000
Your eyes are a little
redder than usual.

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.000
You've got a big mouth
for someone who's standing

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000
on the wrong side of
the electric fence, tough guy.

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.000
You working
for the other fella?

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.000
-That wizard?
-Working with him, not for him.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000
And trust me, it has its perks.

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:37.000
Like what?

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000
This is fucking tragic.

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.000
Look at yourself.

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000
You used to be someone to fear.

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.000
You've fallen down a long way
since you led the Black Dragon.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000
Don't tell me about
the Black Dragon.

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:48.000
I am the Black Dragon.

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.000
Which one's your boss?
Let me guess. The blonde?

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000
That mask cutting off your
air supply, you dumb prick?

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000
I don't take orders
from anyone, Kabal.

1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000
Then you're on the wrong side.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000
Fight with us and you could
have more money

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000
than you know what to do with.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000
Hell, you could turn this
old temple into your own casino

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:05.000
if you wanted to.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.000
Just name your price,
then double it

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000
What are you
waiting for, asshole?

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000
So what would
I need to do?

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:32.000
Just wait here.

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.000
What is that?

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:28.000
You know,
the problem with these

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000
they just don't make them
like they used to.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000
What? You didn't think
you'd actually change me,

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000
The undoing of the prophecy
has begun.

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.000
Back inside.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.000
Dad!

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000
Get back inside!

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000
Cole!

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000
Hey!

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000
I'm the one you want.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000
You see that!

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000
Okay.

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000
Finish them!

1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000
-

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000
Damn! Your breath stinks.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.000
This is not the blood
of a Chosen One.

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000
Your death has no worth.

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.000
Ah, girls can be mean!

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000
-Don't worry, darling!
-

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000
You're still good enough
for me.

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000
Want me to slow down a little?

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000
You're beneath me.

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000
Now, destroy him, my beauty.

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000
Flawless victory.

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000
-Dad!
-No!

1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000
Now I tear out your spine,
champion!

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000
Fuck this.

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000
-Mom!

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:42.000
Get in the truck.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.000
Get in the truck!

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000
No, no.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000
Mom!

1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.000
Get closer!

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000
No, Mom!

1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000
Aah!

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:16.000
Cole!

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.000
Allison!

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.000
Aah!

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000
Get off me!

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000
Daddy, use your uppercut!

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000
You okay?

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000
We're fine. Are you okay?

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:33.000
Yeah.

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:35.000
Badass suit, Dad.

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:45.000
Blade!

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.000
Help!

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.000
-What's that?
-It's okay.

1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:58.000
It's a doorway back...

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.000
It's not over.

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:09.000
Impossible.

1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.000
Thank you for helping
my fighter find his arcana.

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.000
After 4000 years, the Hasashi
bloodline still lives on.

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000
Bi-Han.

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000
Stop him!

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000
Your soul's mine.

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000
He's about
to get his soul sucked.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000
I love the scream
right before--

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000
-Gotcha.
-

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000
Shang Tsung!

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000
No!

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000
Where are we?

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000
We are in the void.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:33.000
It is the realm
between your world and mine.

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000
Shang Tsung
cannot follow us here.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000
If we're to die...

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000
it was supposed
to be together.

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.000
I'm sorry, Liu Kang.

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000
Without Kung Lao,

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.000
Earthrealm is lost.

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.000
Lord Raiden.

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:13.000
Why couldn't you save him?

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:14.000
All the gods are forbidden

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:18.000
from engaging in one realm's
war against another.

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.000
It is my job
to protect Earthrealm

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000
but I cannot save
every soul within it.

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:25.000
No.

1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.000
It's not over,
we still need to fight.

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000
Cole.

1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000
The blood on this blade
is your ancestor's.

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000
Hanzo Hasashi's.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000
I took it from him
the day he died.

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:47.000
Use it and the spirit of Hanzo
fights with you.

1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:52.000
So what's the plan?

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.000
We need to fight smarter.

1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:57.000
We need to control the fight.

1:20:58.000 --> 1:20:59.000
How?

1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.000
I mean, they're better trained
and better prepared.

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000
Plus they don't mind
breaking the rules.

1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000
We need to split them up.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000
Lord Raiden,
can you send anyone anywhere?

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.000
Well, they don't want
a tournament.

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000
Let's give them one.

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000
But let's do it our way.

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.000
Give me Reiko.

1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.000
I got a score to settle.

1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.000
Hey, big boy!

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:35.000
Sonya...

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000
Please tell me I get
the bitch with the teeth.

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000
You get to take out
your old buddy, Kano.

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000
I know I've seen you
kick his ass before,

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000
but he's got a laser now.
Watch out for that.

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:46.000
Oh, I got an idea.

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:49.000
Honey, I'm home.

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000
Liu and I will take
Mileena and Kabal.

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000
I know this is
personal for you.

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:55.000
Are you ready?

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.000
You again.

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.000
What about Sub-Zero?

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000
Nobody's taking him
out one on one.

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:11.000
Yeah.

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000
We save Sub-Zero for last.

1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.000
We take him out together
as a team.

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.000
Oh-oh.

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.000
Yeah, these motherfuckers work.

1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:33.000
Ah! Damn it!

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.000
I'd come out if I were you.

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:07.000
Oh!

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.000
Fucking bitch!

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.000
Hey!

1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000
And you owe me...

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000
three million dollars.

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:55.000
Fucking hell!

1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000
This is a bit harder
than I thought.

1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:00.000
-

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000
Tell me, blondie,
how does that feel?

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:07.000
It feels fucking amazing...

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.000
-Oh!
-...mate.

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000
Oh, I'm sorry, did I cut ya?

1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.000
What the fuck!

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000
For Kung Lao.

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000
Shit!

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.000
A little help!

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.000
That's pretty cool.

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000
Little parting gift
from Kano.

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000
Okay.
I'm almost ready.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.000
How about you?

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000
Are you sure Dad's gonna be
able to find us?

1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000
Completely sure.
Look, I just want to get us

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000
Fuck another four armed monster
showing up.

1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:06.000
Emily!

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.000
No! Emily! No!

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.000
Finally the Hasashi bloodline
will end.

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:01.000
Now you will die
with your family.

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000
The blade of Hanzo.

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.000
Get over here.

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:48.000
For the Lin Kuei.

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:32.000
-Dad.
- Okay. I got you.

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000
These are my friends.

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.000
I am Liu Kang.

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000
Sit. I will warm you.

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.000
I'm impressed.

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000
I thought you said
you couldn't get involved.

1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000
Shang Tsung.

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.000
The prophecy
has been fulfilled.

1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:55.000
Has the blood on your hands
taught you nothing?

1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.000
No matter
how many of my people

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.000
there will always be another
to take their place.

1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:09.000
Today you have killed
my warriors

1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000
and you think you have won.

1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.000
But death
is only another portal.

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:27.000
Next time I see you,
I will not bring fighters.

1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.000
I will bring armies.

1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000
You will return to Outworld
at once.

1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:43.000
Earthrealm--

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000
He talks so much.

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000
What happens next?

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000
Today we are victorious.

1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000
But there are other enemies
to fight.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000
We cannot let our guard down.

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:02.000
I'll assemble a new list
of champions.

1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.000
You must find them.

1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.000
Who's first?

1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:23.000
My man,
I was just about to call you.

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000
I need you tomorrow night.

1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:29.000
Sorry. My days fighting
for 200 bucks are done.

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000
Oh, you're finally quitting,
huh?

1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.000
Yeah, uh
something like that.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000
Where're you gonna go?

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.000
Hollywood.

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:41.000
Hollywood? What the hell's
in Hollywood?

1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000
Not what, who.

1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:45.000
It's been fun.
