00:02.469 --> 00:05.170
 - Oh, man, this is beautiful!

00:05.172 --> 00:06.372
      Thank you very much.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.374
   - Starting a soda company,
            are we?

00:08.376 --> 00:13.345
- Ah, fiona, you know, when you
  use the word "we" like that,

00:13.347 --> 00:15.381
    It just makes me wanna--
              ah!

00:15.383 --> 00:17.383
    - Ooh, what did you do?

00:17.385 --> 00:21.353
 I just got all my supplies for
this epic <i> three stooges</i> marathon

00:21.355 --> 00:23.355
 They're airing on channel 905.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.424
   - Shouldn't you really be
          cutting back

00:25.426 --> 00:28.594
   Until your royalty checks
         come in again?

00:28.596 --> 00:30.262
 - You don't understand, fiona.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.597
    I am introducing marcus

00:31.599 --> 00:34.299
  To the greatest comedy trio
          of all time.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.467
- No, I think you are forgetting

00:35.469 --> 00:36.702
        The long-running
     british comedy series,

00:36.704 --> 00:38.170
    <i> Last of the summer wine.</i>

00:38.172 --> 00:42.341
- Before you talk, ask yourself,
      "does anyone present

00:42.343 --> 00:44.243
     Actually want to hear
    what I'm about to say?"

00:44.245 --> 00:47.679
 Mrs. Holstein's osteoarthritis
          got so bad,

00:47.681 --> 00:48.680
  She couldn't keep teaching.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.382
  - Darling, that's terrible.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.217
    - I know, it's just that

00:52.219 --> 00:55.387
       They replaced her
 with the coolest teacher ever.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.791
 His name is mr. Chris, and he
  makes english class so fun.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.659
           Last year,
   he canoed through botswana

01:00.661 --> 01:03.495
      In a boat he carved
       from a cedar log.

01:03.497 --> 01:07.266
    He has a scar from where
  a warthog tried to gore him.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.402
       And he says I have
      the soul of a poet.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.137
             - Aw.
       - I mean, usually,

01:12.139 --> 01:14.373
        It's just my mom
that compliments me on my soul.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.308
    Oh, I haven't even told
    you guys the best part.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.077
  We're putting on an evening
of famous shakespeare scenes...

01:18.079 --> 01:24.283
- And mr. Chris cast me to play
  romeo in the balcony scene!

01:24.285 --> 01:27.086
     - Hey, hey, lover boy.
    - Oh, that is so great.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.354
Marcus and I have been reciting
       the balcony scene

01:29.356 --> 01:32.124
     From <i> romeo and juliet</i>
    since he was about four.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.158
      - That's disgusting.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.295
     I told him you'd make
 the balcony set for my scene.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.397
      - Oh, uh, you know,
   I'm a little swamped here.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.866
         Getting ready
   for a <i> stooge-</i> athon, dude.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.634
 - But I already told everybody
   about the epic tree house

01:42.636 --> 01:43.602
         You built me.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.137
      - It is pretty epic.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.438
         - Pretty epic?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.841
    Look at that cherry red
          zigzag trim.

01:48.843 --> 01:52.244
     - Marcus, I know what
    you're doing, all right?

01:52.246 --> 01:54.646
          And flattery
    will get you everywhere.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.749
 - All right, well, let's hear
a bit of your shakespeare then.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.750
          - All right.

      I want you to know,
     I want to be with you.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.364
          Wicka-wicka!
             What?

02:12.366 --> 02:13.866
- And mr. Chris taught you that,
            did he?

02:13.868 --> 02:15.400
            - Yeah.

02:18.771 --> 02:21.240
 - Oh, that is very satisfying,
           isn't it?

02:21.242 --> 02:23.642
            - Yeah.
       It's my religion.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.277
         - Here we go.

   I'm marcus's mother fiona.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.312
  - And I really have an issue
          with the way

03:00.314 --> 03:01.947
     That you're teaching,
        or should I say,

03:01.949 --> 03:05.484
Butchering william shakespeare.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.718
             Yeah.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.356
  - Wow. Pre-handshake insult.
          Impressive.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.560

03:14.562 --> 03:15.961
           I'm chris.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.697
            - Hello.
          Yeah, uh...

03:18.699 --> 03:21.567
       So, the--the words
   of william shakespeare...

03:21.569 --> 03:23.969
            - Right.
 - Have endured for 400 years.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.872
          He's perhaps
the greatest writer in history.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.776
     So, I'd quite like you
   to explain what gives you,

03:30.778 --> 03:34.413
          "mr. Chris,"
    the authority to rewrite

03:34.415 --> 03:35.781
  One of the greatest writers
       that's ever been.

03:35.783 --> 03:36.882
        [clears throat]

03:36.884 --> 03:38.317
     - Okay, first of all,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.751
         I love the guy
       as much as you do.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.220
    It's not like I'm saying
      I'm a better writer

03:41.222 --> 03:44.389
 - Oh, but you think you should
        spread that love

03:44.391 --> 03:47.226
   By teaching impressionable
         young children

03:47.228 --> 03:48.894
         That his words
    are actually irrelevant?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.430
  - No, it's just that I think
 that when it comes to shakes--

03:51.432 --> 03:53.899
   - Will you just let marcus
    do the original version

03:53.901 --> 03:55.267
      Of <i> romeo and juliet?</i>

03:55.269 --> 03:57.302
   He already knows the scene

03:57.304 --> 03:59.004
         And we've been
     performing it together

03:59.006 --> 04:00.372
    Since he was in diapers.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.840
       - Look, I get it.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.642
      You're a single mom,
   it's just you and marcus.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.977
 It's scary for you to let him
         try something

04:04.979 --> 04:06.411
That's out of your comfort zone.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.280
   - No, no, it's not scary,
        it's blasphemy.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.283
      And how do you know
   that I'm a single mother?

04:11.285 --> 04:12.551
 - You regularly act out scenes

04:12.553 --> 04:14.353
   About star-crossed lovers
         with your son.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.654
 It's kind of a dead giveaway.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.422
 Look, I've really got to run.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.857
    I'm not gonna let marcus
     do the original scene.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.692
    - What? What? No, wait.
          W-w-w-what?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.928
   - I'm happy to discuss it
     further if you'd like.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.830
   How about tomorrow night?
       Raphael's at 6:00?

04:24.832 --> 04:28.267
 - Okay, okay, yes, yes, okay.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.369
 - Great, I look forward to it.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.503
     - Well, you shouldn't
   because I'm not finished,

04:31.505 --> 04:33.372
     And let me remind you,

04:33.374 --> 04:35.274
     "a fool thinks himself
          to be wise,

04:35.276 --> 04:38.277

         - How are you?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.301
      - Good, really good.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.303
            - Yeah?
      - Amazing, actually.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.705
        I'm still doing
   my sex-free nomadic year.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.473
  - And how's that working out
            for you?

05:08.475 --> 05:09.574
           - So good.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.476
       I feel so in touch
       with the universe.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.312
       Like right now...

05:13.314 --> 05:14.846
 I notice the smell of the air,

     The breeze on my legs.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.984
     It's almost like a man
    is caressing my calves,

05:18.986 --> 05:23.689
 Slowly moving his strong hands
            up my--

05:23.691 --> 05:25.991
    - Oh, god, there he is.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.660
            - What?
      - God, look at him.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.562
          He is so...

05:30.564 --> 05:31.697
        - Ugh, gorgeous.
          - Arrogant.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.999
             What?
 - What are you talking about?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.935
            - What?
     Come on, look at him.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.904
        I'd dip my chip
       in that man guac,

05:38.906 --> 05:40.539
    If you know what I mean.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.374
 - I don't know what you mean.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.875
- I wonder what he smells like.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.677
        - He smells like
     eau de pompous moron.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.079
    He's making the kids do

05:47.081 --> 05:49.648
       "rap shakespeare."
          ridiculous.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.516
  I'm meeting him at raphael's
     later on to tell him,

05:51.518 --> 05:53.051
  You know, what I actually--
- wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

05:53.053 --> 05:54.820
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
       What? What? What?

05:54.822 --> 05:57.456
  You're going on a date with

05:57.458 --> 06:00.625
           - No, ah!
  It's a parent-teacher thing.

06:00.627 --> 06:03.595
      - After school hours
         at a wine bar?

06:03.597 --> 06:06.898
        Just promise me
  you'll put on something sexy

06:06.900 --> 06:09.468
      Under that oversized
  iroquois priestess cardigan

06:09.470 --> 06:10.869
        You always wear.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.571
     That way, when things
     take a romantic turn,

06:12.573 --> 06:14.039
      You can lose a layer
       and be date ready.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.874
      - I know the garment
   that you're referring to.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.642
   It's a sacagawea inspired
          cowl neck--

06:17.644 --> 06:18.944
         - Look at me.
        Just promise me.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.446
    - Even if it was a date,
        which it isn't,

06:21.448 --> 06:23.949
       How would I know?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.817
       - Okay, you ready?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.953
  If he orders alcohol: Date.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.622
     If he has lost the tie
     and gone open collar,

06:30.624 --> 06:32.657
     Chest hair out: Date.

06:32.659 --> 06:37.062
     If he finds an excuse
      to touch you: Date.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.867
      God, I miss dating.
             - Mmm.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.969
  - And by dating, I mean sex.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.640
        - So, in <i> hamlet,</i>

06:48.642 --> 06:51.843
     Bernardo and marcellus
   are terrified of a ghost.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.679
    I've never met a ghost.
        Have any of you?

06:54.681 --> 06:57.115
   But we've all been scared
      of something, right?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.785
    Well, this russian dude
      named stanislavski,

06:59.787 --> 07:01.853
He said that when you're acting,
     it's important to draw

07:01.855 --> 07:03.555
   From your own experiences

07:03.557 --> 07:05.524
   So we can actually channel
         real emotion.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.559
 So, if I was playing bernardo,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.995
    I would think of a time
    when I was terrified...

07:09.997 --> 07:12.864
    Like when I was climbing
    kangchenjunga in nepal,

07:12.866 --> 07:15.467
    And all of a sudden, an
 avalanche came out of nowhere!

07:15.469 --> 07:16.835
       - What did you do?
 - There was no time to think.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.703
    The earth was crumbling
      from under my feet!

07:18.705 --> 07:21.006
 I leaped over the fault line,
      grabbed onto a tree

07:21.008 --> 07:24.009
     As the earth fell away
          beneath me!

07:24.011 --> 07:25.610
       - It's all right.
       You're safe here.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.913
       - Thanks, marcus.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.916
   - Hey, maybe a little less
        watching marcus,

07:30.918 --> 07:34.886
A little more balcony building,
            please.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.688
  - This guy is not so great,
             right?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.523
     I mean, he seems like
        a real try-hard.

07:38.525 --> 07:41.159
     - Trying way too hard.
      - Yeah, try harder.

07:41.161 --> 07:45.030
  - I mean, sure, he's really
     invested in the lives

07:45.032 --> 07:47.799
     Of all of his students
   and he's really well read,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.034
      He's well traveled.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.169
     If I had smaller ears,

07:51.171 --> 07:53.238
     I'd have that haircut
          in a second.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.540
 - Will you just shut up, dude?

07:55.542 --> 07:56.942
      Go work on the back
        of the balcony.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.044
- I'm just saying he's handsome.
           - Shut up.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.979
   - So I want you guys to go
    and practice your scenes

08:00.981 --> 08:03.215
And really try and channel some
 emotion from your real lives.

08:03.217 --> 08:04.583
             Okay?
           Go to it.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.586
          - All right.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.788
        - Oh, hey, shea.
    What are you doing here?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.089
       - Work detention.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.924
 Apparently you're not allowed
            to paint

08:12.926 --> 08:14.693
       "this is a locker"
        on your locker.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.629
    - You're so existential.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.799
             - Yep.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.235
 - Oh, hey, mr. Chris, I wanted
  you to meet my friend, will.

08:23.237 --> 08:26.538
            - Sure.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.906
        - Ahh, finally.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.708
      My two favorite men
     meeting face to face.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.776
     - How you doing? Will.
          - Mr. Chris.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.044
- I'll go with chris, you know,
     since I'm a grown-up.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.981
      - Oh, uh, mr. Chris,
        will is the guy

08:35.982 --> 08:40.251
  And now he gets to spend his
 days doing whatever he wants.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.120
       - What can I say?
          I'm blessed.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.554
             - Wow.
         Good for you.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.056
      I mean, I'd go crazy
     doing nothing all day.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.092
   But hey, to each his own,
             right?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.660
  - Yeah, I don't do nothing,
           you know?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.829
  I actually have a very busy,
           busy life.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.998
           - He's in
  11 fantasy football leagues.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.633
             Busy.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.834
By the way, who cuts your hair?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.035
        - Do it myself.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.705
 And he's injected some purpose
        into your life.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.941
  You know, I see you're going
         for the small,

09:02.943 --> 09:04.676
      Minimalist approach
        to the balcony.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.878
     Did you have a chance
to look at my director's notes?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.814
Because romeo and juliet should
   feel emotionally connected

09:09.816 --> 09:11.750
   But physically separated,
        and the balcony

09:11.752 --> 09:13.852
    Really needs to provide
         that obstacle.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.687
       - You know, will,
     if you need any help,

09:15.689 --> 09:17.856
      Mr. Chris once built
       a cabin in carmel,

09:17.858 --> 09:21.660
    Just tongue and groove.
       He's the coolest.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.629
   - Yeah, uh, actually this
is just the balcony foundation.

09:24.631 --> 09:28.767
       The balcony itself
 is gonna be much, much bigger.

09:28.769 --> 09:29.901
 - Great, we'll leave you guys
             to it.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.671
            - Great.
    - Bye, guys. Bye, shea.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.040
- We're making a bigger balcony.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.344
             What?

09:39.346 --> 09:42.247
    What are you looking at?

09:47.954 --> 09:49.321
          - Fiona, hi.

09:49.323 --> 09:52.123
          Please, sit.
       - [clears throat]

09:53.659 --> 09:54.926
  - Look, I realize I probably

09:54.928 --> 09:56.628
   Didn't explain myself well
           yesterday.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.063
          - I'll say.
    - It's not exactly easy

09:58.065 --> 10:00.231
   To get 12-year-olds hyped
       about shakespeare,

10:00.233 --> 10:03.335
  So I modernize the language
           at first.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.604
 And then once they get excited
       about the stories

10:05.606 --> 10:07.038
     And they start really
        getting into it,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
       We move our way up
     to the original text.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.308
         - Oh, you do?

10:10.310 --> 10:11.743
      - Yeah, but please,
        don't tell them.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.311
        I like it to be
      a horrible surprise.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.714
          - [chuckles]
  your secret's safe with me.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.116
  - Have you been here before?
  They got a great wine list.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.718
            - Wine?
           Yeah, um--

10:19.720 --> 10:21.686
 Uh, no, I'll look, you order.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.622
    - Uh, can I get a glass
of hot water with lemon, please?

10:23.624 --> 10:27.892
          - [whimpers]
 I'll have an iced tea please.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.995
    - So something tells me
  you've studied shakespeare.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.998
- Uh, I was in <i> midsummer night's</i>
      <i> dream</i> at university.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.065
           - Helena?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.033
             - Yes.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.068
          - Excuse me.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.103
    Can I change that water
           to a glass

10:38.105 --> 10:39.104
     Of the house cabernet?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.271
     We're all adults here.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.708
  - Yeah, I'll have the same.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.976
              Ooh!

10:44.978 --> 10:47.178
   - Well, I gotta be careful
          around you.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.214
      A woman who can hurl
     shakespearian insults

10:49.216 --> 10:50.782
     Is a dangerous thing.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.817
  - Oh, well, you were pretty
    quick with your retorts.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.986
   I think you can handle it.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.988
    - I'm sorry about that.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.357
    Um, you are the opposite
      of an empty vessel.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.860
          - [exhales]
             - ah.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.663
          - Um, so...

11:04.665 --> 11:05.897
    Tell me more about, um--

11:05.899 --> 11:08.033
    - Ah! You guys made it!
             Great.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.201
 Come on, everyone snuggle in.
           Huddle in.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.903
Uh, you know, a few of the other
     parents were concerned

11:11.905 --> 11:13.271
     About the performance,
         so I figured,

11:13.273 --> 11:15.707
 Why don't we all get together
       and talk about it?

11:15.709 --> 11:17.008
            - Yeah.
          - Hey, guys.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.177
          - Hi, marie.

11:23.784 --> 11:27.952
           Sit down!
- I'm a victim of circumstance.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.120
           - [laughs]

11:29.122 --> 11:35.126
       - [vocal warm-ups]

11:35.128 --> 11:36.695
           - Hey, uh,
 what are you doing there, bud?

11:36.697 --> 11:38.196
  You're kind of interrupting
         the hilarity.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.764
     - I'm just practicing
       the vocal warm-ups

11:39.766 --> 11:42.734
      I'm just so excited
        about the play,

11:42.736 --> 11:44.102
   It's really hard to focus
       on anything else.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.037
       - Well, let's try,
        all right, bud?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.772
       - I'm sorry, will.
    I'm ruining it for you.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.774
     I'm just gonna go home
         and rehearse.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.242
    - No, no, we were gonna
    watch it together, man.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.977
    I'm trying to teach you
         some culture,

11:52.979 --> 11:55.213
  And I feel like all you want
 to talk about is shakespeare.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.282
     - It's just mr. Chris
   says my diction is sloppy,

11:57.284 --> 11:59.718
 And I don't have a lot of time
 left before the show tonight.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.787
 And mr. Chris says television
  is an opiate of the masses.

12:02.789 --> 12:05.824
  I'm sorry, will, but I gotta
     go home and practice.

12:05.826 --> 12:09.060
    - Opiate of the masses?

12:09.062 --> 12:13.231
  Mr. Chris's mom is an opiate
         of the masses.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.799
        - So how was it?

12:14.801 --> 12:18.369
  - 94 other parents showed up
         at the table.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.106
 It was definitely not a date.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.876
             - Huh.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.811
            [sighs]
    I'm really sorry, fiona.

12:26.813 --> 12:30.148
           - Oh, no,
      it's not your fault.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.283
I did feel a bit of a connection
        with him though

12:32.285 --> 12:33.418
      When we were there.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.787
Then I realized that he didn't,

12:35.789 --> 12:38.223
      And that it was sort
         of ridiculous

12:38.225 --> 12:40.525
        For me to think
   he'd be interested in me.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.060
     - Well, it's his loss.

12:42.062 --> 12:45.263
         - Yeah, yeah.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.531
        - Does this mean
     I can go out with him?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.867
             - No.
        - Of course not.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.535
            - Mm-mm.
    - I was clearly kidding.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.504
           [applause]
              hey!

12:52.506 --> 12:54.205
         Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
          - Yeah, no.

12:54.207 --> 12:58.376
     Theater, not football.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.846
  - I'm saying double, double,
       toil and trouble.

13:01.848 --> 13:05.116
  - How long before this mess
          will bubble?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.985
         - Am I crazy,
 or does this witch number two

13:06.987 --> 13:08.453
     Have the "it factor"?

13:08.455 --> 13:09.854
  - Do you see that cauldron?

13:09.856 --> 13:11.422
    It looks like it's made
       out of cardboard.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.159
   Our balcony is gonna blow
  that thing out of the water.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.427
 Can't wait to see mr. Chris's
     face when he sees it.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.997
    I love that look he gets
        when he's happy.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.865
There's really nothing like it.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.567
  - Oh, darling, I just wanted
  to make sure your romeo hat

13:22.569 --> 13:26.070
Was cocked correctly, and to do
    our good luck handshake.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.906
  - Oh, I thought you forgot.
        - Oh, no, never.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.110
      - Nothing about this
        is a handshake.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.879
Your hands haven't even touched,
           even once.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.815
     [music ends, applause]

13:36.817 --> 13:38.883
    Okay, buddy, that's us.
           All right.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.318
     Hey, andy, come here.
             - Ah!

13:40.320 --> 13:41.920
            Come on!
      Why you doing that?

13:52.398 --> 13:54.265
         - Whoa, cool!
         - Bloody hell.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.534
   I didn't know juliet lived
   in the chrysler building.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.969
     - Do you think we went
      a little overboard?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.103
           - [scoffs]
         no such thing.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.438
             - Wow.
            - Yeah.

14:00.440 --> 14:06.578
 - Not so small and minimalist
      now, is it, big boy?

14:06.580 --> 14:07.846
             - Hey.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.447
        - There's no way
       I'm climbing that.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.850
   - Look, I know it's tall.
          Like, um...

14:11.852 --> 14:14.586
      Absurdly, insanely,
"what were you thinking?" tall.

14:14.588 --> 14:17.288
          But, it's--
- I'm sorry, mr. Chris, I'm out.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.123
             - Ah!

14:19.125 --> 14:22.327
   - Well, she's a real diva,
           isn't she?

14:22.329 --> 14:24.863
     - I guess we're gonna
have to cancel the grand finale.

14:24.865 --> 14:29.234
           - No, no.
         Nobody panic.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.870
          I'll do it!

14:31.872 --> 14:35.874
    I will, uh, play juliet.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.243
            - Okay.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.546
  - Now, marcus, I don't know
      mr. Chris's version.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.581
   So we'll have to do it as
     shakespeare wrote it,

14:43.583 --> 14:47.585
       And god intended.

14:47.587 --> 14:53.358
      - Wow. Uh-- places.
  Come on, what's the matter?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.927
  - There's this little voice
     inside my head saying,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.629
   "don't go out in front of
       your entire school

14:57.631 --> 15:01.366
      And do a love scene
       with your mother."

15:05.437 --> 15:10.608
       - It is I, juliet.
      Awaiting her romeo.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.379
      I hope he gets here
          in a minute.

15:14.381 --> 15:18.950
             - Woo!
        [more clapping]

15:26.959 --> 15:29.627
 - How camest thou hither, tell
       me, and wherefore?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.663
   The orchard walls are high
       and hard to climb,

15:31.665 --> 15:34.265
     And this place death,
   considering who thou art,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.367
 If my kinsmen find thee here.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.570
- With love's light wings did I
     o'erperch these walls,

15:39.572 --> 15:43.408
  For stony limits cannot hold
           love out.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.411
     And what love can do,
    that dares love attempt.

15:46.413 --> 15:50.548
   Therefore thy kinsmen are
         no stop to me.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.018
     And but thou love me,
     let them find me here.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.625
  - What the hell is he doing?

16:00.627 --> 16:03.161
 He's not supposed to climb it!

16:03.163 --> 16:05.296
- You read the director's notes?
  I read the director's notes.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.132
The guy said read the director's
    notes. Everybody did it.

16:10.736 --> 16:11.970
             - Oh.
           - Oh, oh--

16:11.972 --> 16:13.104
           - Oo, ah!

16:13.106 --> 16:14.138
     - What are you doing?

16:14.140 --> 16:16.975
       - Help! Oh, will.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.543
     - What are you doing?
      What are you doing?

16:18.545 --> 16:21.079
 - Uh, it is I, the craftsman,

16:21.081 --> 16:25.016
       Here to hath help
        with your climb.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.284
     - Craftsman, be gone.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.420
Be gone and let the star-crossed
         lovers resume

16:29.422 --> 16:30.655
   Their forbidden courtship.

16:30.657 --> 16:36.594
  - But I must reinforce thine
      tower so thou romeo

16:36.596 --> 16:38.629
    Doesn't fall and become
           paralyzed.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.199
           [laughter]

16:41.201 --> 16:43.434
    - Well, if the craftsman
        had done his job

16:43.436 --> 16:46.104
     As he was supposed to,
       it seems the tower

16:46.106 --> 16:47.271
   Would stand like a pillar

16:47.273 --> 16:48.773
  And not wobble like a willow
          in the wind.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.475
        [all chuckling]

16:50.477 --> 16:53.344
      - Well, if romeo was
   a small middle school boy

16:53.346 --> 16:56.247
   As he was supposed to be,

16:56.249 --> 17:00.518
And not a growneth man who eats
   too many potato-ith skins,

17:00.520 --> 17:01.719
       We might not have
         this problem!

17:01.721 --> 17:04.589
           [laughter]

17:04.590 --> 17:08.259
   - Craftsman, make thyself
         bloody scarce.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.662
 - Don't you think if it was up
        to the craftsman

17:11.664 --> 17:17.734
 That he'd be pre-- pretty much
   anywhere else in the world

17:17.737 --> 17:21.039
 - Do you really think this is
      the craftsman's idea

17:21.040 --> 17:22.640
        Of a good time?

17:22.642 --> 17:25.609
    Here, give me your leg.
     [indistinct shouting]

17:25.612 --> 17:28.046
         - [shrieking]

17:28.048 --> 17:33.284
      [overlapping shouts]

17:33.286 --> 17:35.553
            - Whoa!
             - Aah!

17:35.555 --> 17:39.090
            Oh! Aah!
        [audience gasps]

17:39.092 --> 17:40.425
              Aah!

17:40.427 --> 17:42.260
   - I begged him to use more
             nails.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.461
             - Unh!
             - Oh.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.697
       Ah! The craftsman
         is very sorry.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.099
      - Going to kill you.

17:48.101 --> 17:51.169
       [roaring applause]

18:11.390 --> 18:11.622
               .

18:11.624 --> 18:15.093
  - You know, I'm sorry buddy,
   that, uh, did not go well.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.594
 - It's all right, it could've
       been a lot worse.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.797
             - How?
        - Maybe a fire.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.699
     - All right, everyone,
           listen up.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.469
 I am going to take the entire
       cast out for pizza

18:24.471 --> 18:27.672
To celebrate a terrific, albeit
      unusual, production.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.507
          Get changed
     out of your costumes,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.709
  Meet me in the lobby in 10.

18:31.711 --> 18:37.381
 - Yes! Catch you later, will.
       - All right, bud.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.683
   - How much work detention
          did you get

18:38.685 --> 18:40.718
 For spray painting one locker?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.754
  - It may have been slightly
     more than one locker.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.257
     It also may have been
 the principal's electric car.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.758
             - Mm.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.595
  - How'd it feel watching two
   grown men fight over you?

18:50.597 --> 18:52.363
             - Huh?
  - I think your skinny-jeaned

18:52.365 --> 18:55.366
     Man friend is a little
threatened by your new best bud.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.769
 - You think will is jealous of
       me and mr. Chris?

18:58.771 --> 19:00.738
    - It's like freud says,

19:00.740 --> 19:04.275
   A big tower is never just
          a big tower.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.682
             - Hey.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.620
- Nah, I decided I'd rather head
         home with you.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.755
   Yo, maybe we could heat up
    some larry-aki chicken?

19:17.757 --> 19:18.823
      Get our <i> stooges</i> on?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.658
  - Uh, what about mr. Chris?

19:20.660 --> 19:25.429
 - He's great and all, but he's
      not...Us, you know?

19:25.431 --> 19:27.265
            - Yeah.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.733
     All right, well, then
     let's get out of here.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.302
 We got about a hundred bottles
    to break over our heads.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.803
   - All right, I'll go home
       and get my helmet.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.672
- You don't need a helmet, man,
        they don't hurt.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.774
- I have a very sensitive skull,
             will.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.610
    Sometimes even my beanie
         makes me sore.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.646
   But I suffer for fashion.

19:41.648 --> 19:45.349
   - Yeah. I think it's time
 we talked about that fashion.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.819
          - [groaning]

19:48.821 --> 19:49.887
            - Hello.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.657
             - Hi.
      - Are you all right?

19:52.659 --> 19:56.260
        - Battle wound.
      Well, balcony wound.

19:56.262 --> 19:59.764
   - I'm sorry that my stupid
   neighbor ruined our scene.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.399
   - Well the play ends with
       a double suicide,

20:01.401 --> 20:04.602
   So all things considered,
it could have been a lot worse.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.836
            - Yeah.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.473
        Um, I'm not sure
       what's happening.

20:09.475 --> 20:13.678
   Um, in the cafe, I thought
       I felt something,

20:13.680 --> 20:14.912
 And then I think I was wrong.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.915
    And then, in that scene,

20:17.917 --> 20:20.451
        That felt real,

20:20.453 --> 20:24.789
       And it's probably
 just because it's shakespeare

20:24.791 --> 20:26.424
 And he is the greatest writer
         who ever lived

20:26.426 --> 20:28.259
           And had--

20:28.261 --> 20:31.429
    - ¶ follow your heart ¶

20:31.431 --> 20:33.731
     ¶ follow your heart ¶

20:33.733 --> 20:37.902
         - It was real.
        At least for me.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.972
I gotta take a group of seventh
     graders out for pizza.

20:40.974 --> 20:44.642
       Good night, fiona.

20:44.644 --> 20:49.513
     - ¶ follow your heart
    and you won't get lost ¶

20:49.515 --> 20:52.283
         - Good night.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.018
             - Ah!
             - Oh!

20:54.020 --> 20:55.553
        [both laughing]

20:55.555 --> 20:58.623
   [slapstick injury sounds]

21:02.495 --> 21:04.862
      - Ah, that was real.
        - Are you okay?

21:04.864 --> 21:08.399
         - That's okay.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.501
             - No!
          - I got it!

21:10.503 --> 21:14.505
   [marcus and will shouting]

21:14.507 --> 21:16.874
       [slapstick noises]

21:16.876 --> 21:19.910
             - Ahh!
            - Yeah!

21:19.912 --> 21:22.346
       - I don't get it.
