You are Samwel Zuma?

I am.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.166
I heard you have a big mouth.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.324
No!

01:37.360 --> 01:39.169
Good morning, Mr. Batouala.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.810
Will you be dining at the table?

01:40.960 --> 01:43.440
- In bed, I think.
- Very good, sir.

Grandpa! Come here!

03:00.200 --> 03:03.249
Tigers in India have
become less abundant in recent years...

03:03.400 --> 03:05.368
...due to excessive hunting.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.329
The big cats are now concentrated...

03:07.480 --> 03:11.565
...in tiny groups, leading to inbreeding,
which weakens resistance to disease.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.121
So nostalgic.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.644
The charming and yet tragic naiveté...

03:17.840 --> 03:19.649
...as if these creatures
will flourish...

03:19.840 --> 03:22.605
...if Harlan and Jack can just manage...

03:22.800 --> 03:25.280
...to relocate a breeding female.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.649
The Mombasa Cartel? Poachers?

03:28.800 --> 03:31.690
Not poachers, Lizzy. Traffickers.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.444
The devils who do the killing...

03:33.600 --> 03:36.888
...are the smallest of cogs
in a very large machine...

03:37.040 --> 03:40.806
...and the Mombasa Cartel
is the worst of the lot.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.567
They operate behind
an impenetrable veil of secrecy...

03:44.720 --> 03:48.930
...enforced by brute terror
and a rat's nest of corporate fronts.

03:49.120 --> 03:53.125
Subsidiaries of shells
inside numbered accounts...

03:53.280 --> 03:55.521
This is gonna take some convincing.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.842
The FBI's job is to protect people.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.970
Granted.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.040
Let's forget about the animals
for a moment...

04:03.200 --> 04:06.124
...the wholesale extinctions,
the impact on the environment.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.886
Let's just consider the human toll.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.806
The thorough corruption
of local authorities...

04:11.960 --> 04:15.760
...political assassinations,
the massacres of entire villages...

04:15.920 --> 04:17.250
...and wildlife compounds.

04:17.440 --> 04:22.970
Eradicated for the most base
of all possible motives: profit.

04:23.120 --> 04:27.330
Hundreds of billions of dollars a year...

04:27.480 --> 04:29.562
...in blood money.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.882
Human blood money.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.122
This is important to you.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.521
Someday,
the creatures on that program...

04:45.720 --> 04:49.202
...will be akin to unicorns and griffins.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.330
A fairy-tale bestiary written
in past tense...

04:52.520 --> 04:55.524
...and no one is lifting
a finger to stop it.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.650
Why not, Lizzy?

05:01.240 --> 05:03.163
Why not us?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.128
Sorry,
this is a controlled-class medication.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.970
I can't refill it
without a prescription.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.767
And I told you, you're not refilling it,
you're replacing it.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.604
The pills were stolen from my car.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.603
- You file a police report?
- Yeah.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.444
Yeah, of course I did.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.929
Look...

05:22.080 --> 05:25.209
...I'll get in touch with my doctor.
I'll, uh... I'll be right back.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.327
Next.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.245
Over the last few years,
high-ranking poachers...

05:31.400 --> 05:33.448
...have disappeared without a trace...

05:33.640 --> 05:35.802
...from the Jalloh and Yeboah clans...

05:35.960 --> 05:37.610
...the Bholas in India...

05:37.760 --> 05:40.240
...and the Rocha Cartel in Bolivia.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.010
Now, no one's taking credit yet...

05:42.160 --> 05:44.686
...but according to Reddington,
the Mombasa Cartel...

05:44.840 --> 05:47.923
...is working to corner
the illegal wildlife trade.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.445
- Sorry.
- Four days ago...

05:49.600 --> 05:52.444
...a dead body washed up
south of Petropavlovsk...

05:52.600 --> 05:55.922
...on the Kamchatka Peninsula,
flayed and skinned...

05:56.120 --> 05:59.806
...with surgical precision, according
to the local medical examiner.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.571
- This victim have a name?
- Joseph Batouala. Kenyan.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.803
Part of the Wanjiku Cartel,
the alleged mastermind...

06:05.960 --> 06:08.406
...behind the 2013 elephant massacre...

06:08.560 --> 06:10.801
...at Hwange National Park
in Zimbabwe.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.566
The park's watering holes were dosed
with cyanide...

06:13.720 --> 06:16.849
...killing 300 elephants
and thousands of other animals.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.082
- The work of our victim?
- Victims.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.210
High-ranking officials
from other cartels have also disappeared.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.801
Now, according to Reddington,
these gangs are just...

06:24.960 --> 06:27.327
...small fish in a very big pond.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.565
By far, the most destructive
is the Mombasa Cartel.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.323
It's Reddington. I have to take this.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.404
They are ruthless, secretive
and highly organized.

06:41.560 --> 06:45.849
The Mombasa Cartel smuggles about
a billion dollars in contraband per year...

06:46.000 --> 06:47.650
...from ivory and hides...

06:47.840 --> 06:51.083
...to the illegal import of exotic pets,
to traditional folk remedies.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.651
- Remedies? For what?
- Anything.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.451
From blindness to erectile dysfunction.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.531
In Vietnam, the horn of a rhinoceros
is believed to cure cancer...

06:59.680 --> 07:02.286
...so commands a price
of about $9000 per gram.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.609
- Where was Batouala last seen alive?
- Hotel d'Argent, Paris.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.969
Paris. And yet his body washes ashore
on the Russian Coast.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.370

or should I?

I don't have buddies.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.766
Geoff and I simply share
a number of interests.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.571
Among them, the protection
of endangered animals.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.001
I act as a bundler for his charities.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.650
And what does he do in return?

09:40.800 --> 09:43.610
Nothing nefarious, I assure you.

Here we go.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.366
Queen to B4. Check.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.047
Your name is Judy Trierweiler.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.771
You're an activist,
investigative reporter...

10:08.960 --> 10:12.407
“researching an expose
on the Mombasa Cartel.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.166
You post under
the screen name "Elsa."

10:15.320 --> 10:18.130
- And when is this happening?
- Tonight. La Porte Rouge.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.647
Eighteenth Street and Columbia.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.371
Ten-ish. Dress down.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.040
- What is it?
- Uh, Trierweiler, right?

10:28.080 --> 10:31.721
Judy Trierweiler, a.k.a. Elsa.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.203

11:04.200 --> 11:06.487
Geoff Perl. You must be Elsa.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.206
Seen your posts. Like your style.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.964
A friend tells me...

11:11.120 --> 11:13.646
...you want some inside dope
on the Mombasa Cartel.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.804
- I've had a hard time getting a toehold.
- Welcome to the party.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.885
My foundation's had the Mombasas
in our sights since our inception.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.646
Public enemy number one.
The worst of the worst.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.450
And very smart.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.967
Crafty bastards at the top keep
their hands clean...

11:28.160 --> 11:31.721
...by financing the wetwork through
a hundred shells and offshores.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.287
Never been able to crack that firewall.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.681
You wanna give it a try. Hm.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.120
Gotta warn you, though...

11:38.280 --> 11:40.044
...could be very dangerous.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.850
I can handle myself.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.240
I'm sure you can.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.768
I wager you can handle
just about anything.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.004
I knew Geoff would adore you.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.050
You're a dead ringer
for the last two of his three wives.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.009
Oh? What did his first one look like?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.606
More like me than you, I'm afraid.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.842
Geoff is a savant of sorts.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.765
Married into a small fortune,
built it into Deckard...

12:01.920 --> 12:04.605
...sits on the boards
of half a dozen tech companies...

12:04.760 --> 12:06.762
...owns a big piece of all of them.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.448
Then plows millions
into animal-related causes.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.568
What did he have on the Mombasas?

12:13.720 --> 12:15.961
Lee Chung.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.930
Emerson-Concorde Imports.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.525
- Who are you? Why you do this?
- FBI.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.162
We were wondering if you wouldn't
mind assisting us in an investigation.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.243
What kind of investigation?

12:37.440 --> 12:39.010
The kind where if you don't help...

12:39.160 --> 12:42.403
...I just yell, "A gun,"
and we beat your ass to the curb.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.005
I am unarmed.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.440
You gonna cooperate?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.602
Please say no.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.891
What?

13:03.040 --> 13:04.530
Nothing.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.048
You were late to work again.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.440
You seem a little edgy.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.611
I'm fine. Thanks, mom.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.765
Chung's business specializes
in the importation...

13:17.920 --> 13:20.526
...of meats and animal parts
from endangered species.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.685
He claims he doesn't know anything
about the Mombasa Cartel.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.002
Show him the contraband tagged
in his warehouse?

13:27.200 --> 13:29.806
Yeah. And the estimated fees
Aram worked up.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.440
- It's a lot.
- Plus, 112 charges pending.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.251
- That didn't rattle him?
- Whoa. Flag up. We got another one.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.210
Pulled up this morning
in a fishing net in Hokkaido, Japan.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.441
Same MO, skinned.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.002
Local ME ID'd him from the serial
numbers found on an artificial hip.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.084
- "Alejandro Gomez." Bolivian.
- Rocha Cartel?

13:46.240 --> 13:50.211
According to Bolivian police and WCS,
rumors are that Gomez worked for...

13:50.360 --> 13:52.647
The Mombasa Cartel. Chung broke.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.883
It turns out our original victim
was not with the Wanjiku Cartel.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.202
He defected a year ago
to the Mombasas.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.169
Somebody's poaching the poachers.

14:01.920 --> 14:05.367
- Tell me what you said.
- I said you wouldn't be alone.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.890
Yeah, she's waiting now.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.485
You want me to go get her?

14:10.640 --> 14:13.211
- Yep.
- Thanks for the 24-hour reprieve.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.522
I met with Reddington yesterday.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.284
- Told him?
- I started to...

14:17.440 --> 14:20.125
...but, no, I didn't.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.011
That's too bad. It would've
been better coming from you.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.925
I hope you understand.
I don't have a choice.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.206
Neither do I.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.487
Freeze! On the ground!

14:44.440 --> 14:47.649
Father called.
He found another friend for Matthew.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.371
I just got back.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.126
Oh, dear Lord, listen to you go on.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.046
I'm the one that does
all the abductions.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.089
I'm the one who takes all the risks...

15:00.240 --> 15:01.924
...while the two of you sit around...

15:06.480 --> 15:08.528
We're a family.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.361
Everyone does his part.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.128
The poachers your father identifies
deserve what they get.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.329
You should be proud to help him...

15:19.520 --> 15:21.682
...and to help your brother too.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.410
I know it's hard.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.691
But you know I love you.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.882
Peter, my rock.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.410
Hey!

16:06.560 --> 16:09.040
Hey, mister! You forgot.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.325
My hat. Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I forgot it.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.970
It's my favorite.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.924
Thank you.
I'm sorry, what's your name?

16:16.120 --> 16:18.327
- Zoe.
- Zoe. Thank you so much, Zoe.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.529
- Oh, no, really, I can't. No, I'm good.
- No, no, please. I insist.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.643
All right, then. I'm Kenneth, by the way.
Kenneth Rathers.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.926
Hello, Kenneth.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.404
Thank you again, Zoe.
I am quite fond of this hat.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.164
Let me see.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.365
Very snappy, Kenneth.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.409
Later.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.688
Taking into account
estimated time of death...

16:42.840 --> 16:45.810
...I've programmed a simulation
illustrating point of origin...

16:45.960 --> 16:48.770
...by running the tidal
and ocean current data for the dates...

16:48.920 --> 16:50.524
...our two floaters washed up...

16:50.680 --> 16:52.330
...in Japan and Russia.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.641
Check it out.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.242
Orange one is Gomez,
and as you can see...

16:57.400 --> 17:00.324
...both bodies were dumped
somewhere off the coast...

17:00.480 --> 17:02.289
- ...of Sitka, Alaska.
- The location...

17:02.440 --> 17:06.047
...of Animal Underground Network,
a militant animal rights group.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.247
- Was?
- Yes.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.608
In 1971, their leader, Timothy Carlyle,
along with six others...

17:10.800 --> 17:13.406
...were tried and convicted
on five counts of homicide...

17:13.560 --> 17:16.131
...for stalking and killing
grizzly poachers...

17:16.280 --> 17:17.724
...up at Katmai National Park.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.611
I remember that case.
Became a bit of a cause celebre.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.921
Yes, the Sitka Seven.

17:22.079 --> 17:25.721
- Seven? Why's it always seven?
- After the bust, the whole thing imploded.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.089
By all accounts, the rest of the group
were more or less hangers-on.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.447
- Flakes, idiots.
- Go deep on Animal Underground...

17:31.600 --> 17:33.443
...see what became of every member.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.604
Arrests, activities, associates,
especially those still in Sitka.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.330
- What about Chung?
- Cut him loose.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.369
Put a tail on him,
see where he leads us.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.284
Ressler, get packed.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.284
I want you in Sitka for face time
with anyone Samar turns up.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.964
He's been on the FBI's
10 Most Wanted List for years...

17:50.120 --> 17:52.282
...but authorities may be
finally closing in...

17:52.440 --> 17:56.411
...on notorious international criminal
Raymond "Red" Reddington.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.643
Acting on an anonymous tip,
police arrested a man they say...

17:59.800 --> 18:02.007
...is a close associate
of Reddington's...

18:02.160 --> 18:06.245
...and who may be able to lead them
to the elusive Concierge of Crime.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.490
Was all this really necessary?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.051
How about I find someone...

18:13.200 --> 18:15.646
...to follow you around 24/7
and see how you like it?

18:15.800 --> 18:18.804
You know as well as I this has nothing
to do with being followed.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.167
This is about being found out.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.324
You're hiding something.
Why else risk my capture?

18:24.480 --> 18:27.768
- Ezra's not gonna talk.
- I know that, but you didn't.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.362
And now you're holding him in
a cement box under a no-contact order.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.010
Congratulations, Lizzy.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.970
You've plugged the hole,
but the darn will fail.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.248

21:05.680 --> 21:07.842
...with a tranquilizer dart...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.162
Possibly. We're not sure.
He might have fled.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.129
We flagged his passport.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.850
We'll keep you posted.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.361
The closest former
Animal Underground members...

21:16.520 --> 21:17.885
...that we could find...

21:18.040 --> 21:20.008
...are in Anchorage.

Outside of one arrest...

21:21.520 --> 21:23.284
...for possession, they look clean.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.442
- The ranch.
- Oh, yeah.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.969
And make a run out to Igaluk Ranch.
It's the former location of their commune.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.930
Property was picked up at auction,
after the big bust...

21:33.080 --> 21:35.686
...by Wendigo, LLC.
- I'll check it out.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.564
The two vies were skinned
antemortem.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.643
Presuming Sitka is the dumping site...

21:42.800 --> 21:45.087
- They were transported alive.
- You think sedated?

21:45.280 --> 21:46.770
No doubt, but still...

21:46.920 --> 21:48.649
Customs, security?

21:48.800 --> 21:52.600
Someone would've... Plus, how did
they get on to a commercial flight...

21:52.760 --> 21:56.048
...without proper documentation?
- Unless you don't fly commercial.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.683
Homeland Security is loath
to inconvenience the rich and powerful.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.884
Pull information on private jets...

22:03.040 --> 22:05.520
...departing the same days
our victims were abducted.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.769
Crosscheck tail numbers,
see if you can find a pattern.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.085
Hello?

23:13.640 --> 23:15.642
Private property.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.087
I'm sorry.
I didn't know anyone was here.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.129
Well, now you do.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.681
There's signs posted along the road.
You best leave.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.167
I'm Ressler, FBI.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.210
- You mind if I ask you some questions?
- What kind of questions?

23:28.360 --> 23:31.125
About the Animal Underground.
You heard of them?

23:31.280 --> 23:34.045
Yeah, a little. They're gone now.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.680
Gone a long time.
Now it's just us up here.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.571
- Us?
- Me. My son, Peter.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.561
- Anyone else?
- No.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.325
- Howdy.
- You must be Peter.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.084
Yeah, Peter Kincaid. And you are?

23:52.280 --> 23:53.930
- Donald Ressler.
- He's with the FBI.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.167
Oh.

23:55.320 --> 23:58.449
Anything you can tell me
about the former owners?

23:58.600 --> 24:01.080
Never met them.
Bunch of them went to jail, right?

24:01.240 --> 24:02.924
A long time ago.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.765
Sorry you came all the way
out here for nothing.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.406
That's okay.
Thanks for the cooperation.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.210
Yeah.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.570
- What do you have there?
- Goat.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.685
Didn't the people who used
to be here have a bunch of goats?

24:23.840 --> 24:26.207
Lots of people got goats.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.325
- You mind if I take a look?
- Just watch your fingers. He bites.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.686
Paris, two hours
after Batouala disappears...

24:50.880 --> 24:55.522
...a chartered Citation CJ3-S leaves
a private airstrip outside the city.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.929
Sao Paulo, another Citation departs
45 minutes...

24:59.080 --> 25:01.765
...after Alejandro Gomez is abducted.
- Same pilots?

25:01.920 --> 25:05.845
I got two different names here,
but both are bogus, so I'd say yes.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.446
He's comfortable with a Citation.
Why change horses?

25:08.600 --> 25:12.969
Right. So I checked local airports
and got a third hit.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.122
Another Citation
which departed yesterday...

25:15.320 --> 25:17.607
...from Westchester at 5:12 p.m.
- Chung.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.444
- Did they file a flight plan?
- Bogus.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.728
All over the map.
Uh, Tokyo, Dubai, Paris.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.121
- Who chartered them?
- Three separate jets...

25:24.280 --> 25:26.965
...three separate companies,
one domiciled in Oslo...

25:27.120 --> 25:30.761
...the second in Belgium,
the third in South Africa.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.281
They all share
a common corporate parent...

25:33.440 --> 25:35.249
...or should say a common corporate...

25:35.400 --> 25:38.961
...second-uncle-cousin-sister
once removed.

25:39.840 --> 25:42.810
What do you know
about a company called Wendigo, LLC?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.962
Wendigo?

25:45.760 --> 25:48.240
- What connects them to the cartel?
- Not sure.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.922
All we know is Wendigo controls
chartered jets used in the abductions...

25:52.080 --> 25:54.686
...and they own a piece of property
in the same area...

25:54.840 --> 25:57.844
...where the bodies were dumped
Sitka, Alaska.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.004
Used to be a commune for a group
called Animal Underground.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.441
Ressler went up there
to ask some questions.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.125
He's fallen out of contact.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.851
Anchorage division's scrambling HRT,
and Samar and I...

26:08.040 --> 26:10.407
...are set to rendezvous
with them in Juneau.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.847
If you can dig up any names
behind Wendigo...

26:13.920 --> 26:18.608
Lizzy, be careful up there.
There's been a change of plans.

26:32.920 --> 26:33.967
Did you call in?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.043
- What's happening?
- Is anybody gonna come?

26:36.240 --> 26:38.607
What the hell is that music?

26:45.080 --> 26:46.127
No one's here.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.650
They left us to die.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.564
Remember, Matty...

26:50.720 --> 26:52.848
...only the animals that are tagged.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.769
Happy hunting.
I'll be at the house with Mom.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.561
Hey. Stop! Stop!

27:22.720 --> 27:24.768
Where the hell are you running?

27:27.640 --> 27:29.290
Where are we?

27:29.440 --> 27:30.885
- What do you know?
- Nothing.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.560
I don't know anything.
Like you, I just...

27:34.640 --> 27:38.690
How long did it take? To get here
from the ranch. How long did it take?

27:38.880 --> 27:41.770
- Ten, 15 minutes, no more.
- I passed a gas station...

27:41.920 --> 27:43.445
...on the highway east of here.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.802
If we can get back there...

27:46.760 --> 27:48.205
What's the matter with you?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.727
- I'm fine. Nothing.
- You looking for your pills?

27:50.880 --> 27:54.043
They took them.
They took everything.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.685
What are you?

27:58.840 --> 28:00.808
A junkie? You're a cop.

28:03.840 --> 28:05.046
I'm not a junkie.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.680
That's what all junkies say.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.402
I've been trying to reach you
for six hours.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.329
You know this is when I meditate.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.888
A man from the FBI showed up
asking questions.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.883
- Peter had to take him out.
- What?

28:38.040 --> 28:39.530
He had no choice. He saw Chung.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.682
- Is he dead?
- Well, he will be.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.808
- We gave him to Matthew.
- Okay, listen.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.931
This time can't be like the others.
No skinning. No stuffing. No evidence.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.407
- Peter knows what to do.
- Matthew won't like that.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.800
I don't care.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.446
I should've tipped off the police
when he began his hobby.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.444
And have him locked up
in some hellhole?

28:57.600 --> 29:00.524
He wouldn't have lasted a month
and you know it.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.963
He's a child.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.846
He's your child.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.843
I know that.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.487
Tell Peter...

29:09.680 --> 29:11.762
...to call me when it's done.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.090
Namaste, Geoff.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.611
- Any intelligence on who's up there?
- Two confirmed.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.445
Rosemary, a.k.a. Skye, Kincaid
and her son, Peter.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.887
The woman's an associate
of Animal Underground.

29:33.080 --> 29:36.641
Local girl, got knocked up by a member,
a fella they called Ace.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.928
Her son Pete is an expert guide
and tracker.

29:39.080 --> 29:42.687
- Anybody else?
- There could be. Word is...

29:42.880 --> 29:44.848
...Rosie was pregnant again
40 years ago...

29:45.000 --> 29:47.446
...and insisted on giving birth up
at the ranch.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.331
Social Services paid her a visit
about eight months in...

29:50.480 --> 29:52.164
...tried to change her mind.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.926
They reported
that she was no longer with child.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.570
People have talked...

29:56.720 --> 29:59.121
...hunters and whatnot,
and there's been sightings...

29:59.280 --> 30:01.886
...of somebody or something else.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.166
Something?

30:03.920 --> 30:07.288
The rumor is, it's Rosie's younger son.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.961
FBI, I need to use your phone.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.690
Someone's after...

30:28.240 --> 30:29.730
Hey.

30:34.680 --> 30:39.925
♪ Drifting on many
Of the silver moonbeams ♪

30:40.600 --> 30:41.806
Jesus.

30:43.560 --> 30:48.009

30:53.160 --> 30:54.685
There you are.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.649
Sean Salter.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.044
You went by the name Ace back then.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.726
You left Animal Underground
two years before...

31:02.920 --> 31:05.571
...the Sitka Seven killings
and subsequent trials.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.926
Lucky, that.

31:07.080 --> 31:11.449
But then you've always had a talent
for well-timed exits.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.290
Well, it seems, Ace...

31:13.440 --> 31:15.886
...there's still some freaks up there
in the woods...

31:16.040 --> 31:17.804
...skinning people and dumping them.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.122
Poachers, not people.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.123
Responsible for the decimation...

31:22.280 --> 31:24.487
...of hundreds of wild
and endangered species.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.405
Yes, horrific.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.483
If that was your endgame,
I'd write you...

31:29.640 --> 31:32.371
...another sizable contribution
to keep up the good work.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.522
But that isn't the endgame,
is it, Geoff?

31:36.160 --> 31:39.209
You see, before I got involved
with your foundation...

31:39.360 --> 31:41.840
...I ran a comprehensive
background check.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.281
All your business interests,
corporations.

31:44.440 --> 31:48.411
Among them, a rather innocuous shell
called Wendigo, LLC.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.766
Everything looked fine.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.765
Shame on me.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.325
Turns out Wendigo holds
controlling stock...

31:59.520 --> 32:01.522
...in a small but lucrative concern...

32:01.680 --> 32:04.286
...called Emerson-Concorde Imports...

32:04.480 --> 32:07.768
...that you recently identified
to a lovely young friend of mine...

32:07.920 --> 32:10.002
...as a front for the Mombasa Cartel.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.642
Why would I kill my own people?

32:12.800 --> 32:15.041
You're a businessman.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.167
As long as you were killing off
the competition...

32:18.320 --> 32:21.324
...you took the opportunity
to clear out your own deadwood.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.529
The evidence of your guilt
is convoluted but irrefutable.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.843
I simply cannot fathom the journey...

32:28.000 --> 32:30.241
...the moral detours necessary...

32:30.400 --> 32:34.564
...to change a man who cherished
all creatures great and small...

32:34.760 --> 32:37.604
...into one who profits
from their slaughter.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.606
My motives have never been
about profits.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.240
I have more money than I'll ever need.

32:45.440 --> 32:46.965
And there's been no journey...

32:47.120 --> 32:49.122
...no detours.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.209
I'm the same guy I've always been.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.687
I'm a conservationist.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.568
And as you point out,
I'm a businessman.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.564
I understand the law
of supply and demand.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.247
As long as the market exists...
And it will always exist.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.971
...There will be people willing
to meet the demand.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.963
It can't be stopped.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.202
It can be controlled.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.930
A natural monopoly.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.570
Exactly.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.811
These cartels
are completely out of control.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.362
But through a natural monopoly,
the supply curve can be managed.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.164
The short-term demand can be met...

33:23.320 --> 33:26.642
...without threatening
the long-term survival of the species.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.404
Geoff.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.604
That was...

33:33.480 --> 33:34.720
...breathtaking.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.409
An operatic perversion
of righteous intent.

33:38.560 --> 33:42.724
But your strategy,
no matter how noble the rhetoric...

33:42.880 --> 33:44.120
...is betrayed...

33:44.280 --> 33:47.568
...and, inevitably,
defined by your actions.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.370
This isn't about conservation.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.171
It's about consolidation.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.769
We are what we do, Ace.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.251
What do you want?

33:56.400 --> 33:59.370
A list identifying
every member and operative...

33:59.520 --> 34:01.090
...in the Mombasa Cartel...

34:01.240 --> 34:03.766
...their business entities
and distribution networks.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.763
- Or?
- Or I shoot you.

No!

37:09.240 --> 37:11.049
There it is.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.408
That's everything.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.767
The whole cartel.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.687
You know, 29 years ago
in Sierra Leone...

37:27.840 --> 37:31.208
...there was a farmer
named Samwel Zuma...

37:31.360 --> 37:33.408
...who had the audacity to identify...

37:33.600 --> 37:35.807
...several low-level
Mombasa operatives...

37:35.960 --> 37:38.122
...to local authorities.

37:38.280 --> 37:42.604
The Cartel massacred the entire family.
All but the youngest son.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.366
He was sold to a local ring
of flesh peddlers.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.569
The majority of children
in those circumstances...

37:48.720 --> 37:51.963
...don't last more than nine months.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.970
He survived eight years.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.404
He was 14 when I found him.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.284
Too old, too tall...

38:02.440 --> 38:07.082
...too angry and dangerous
to be of any further value.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.690
He was left to die...

38:09.840 --> 38:12.161
...chained to a standpipe
in the basement...

38:12.320 --> 38:14.084
...of a squalid brothel in Nairobi...

38:14.240 --> 38:16.129
...branded, burned...

38:16.280 --> 38:18.203
...barely alive.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.009
So I took him.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.041
Made him well,
saw to his education.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.129
He graduated university...

38:30.280 --> 38:32.965
...with a bachelor's degree
in English literature.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.367
He speaks four languages fluently...

38:35.520 --> 38:37.682
...and can get by
in half a dozen more.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.683
He is...

38:41.560 --> 38:43.324
...splendid.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.925
His name is Dembe.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.171
Dembe Zuma.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.521
Raymond, don't.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.849
That was then.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.970
It serves no purpose to kill him now.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.690
You see that, Geoff?

39:07.360 --> 39:09.203
That is what a good man does.

39:09.840 --> 39:13.322
That is what separates men like him...

39:13.480 --> 39:14.925
...from men like you.

I've been thinking

41:44.520 --> 41:47.649
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made a decision yet.

41:49.680 --> 41:52.365
The other day was close.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.851
I thought about telling Reddington.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.048
He'd know what to do.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.007
But the truth is,
this is my responsibility.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.284
One way or the other.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.767
I've answered all your questions.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.083
Liz.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.364
You can't hide me forever.
