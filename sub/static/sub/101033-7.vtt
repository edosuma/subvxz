You sure?
I saw her staring at me.

39:19.887 --> 39:22.095
I think you're mistaken.

39:22.178 --> 39:24.303
If you say so.

39:24.387 --> 39:27.387
Wish my grandfather
was alive to see this.

39:27.470 --> 39:31.053
Me standing here with two
black mayoral candidates.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.845
- Yeah.
- He'd be so proud.

39:33.929 --> 39:37.053
You know, my grandfather opened
this bank over 80 years ago.

39:37.136 --> 39:38.553
One of the first black banks
in the city.

39:38.637 --> 39:40.970
Yeah, I was sad to hear it had
to close down a few years ago.

39:41.053 --> 39:42.720
[Marcus]
Yeah, me too.

39:42.804 --> 39:43.970
You know those white people

39:44.053 --> 39:45.553
weren't gonna let us
have a black bank.

39:45.637 --> 39:47.428
Well, if more black folks
put their money in the bank,

39:47.512 --> 39:48.929
maybe it wouldn't
have had to close down.

into an early debate.

39:51.345 --> 39:54.178
It was nice while it lasted.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.512
Now, look,
every mayoral election,

39:56.595 --> 39:59.345
to honor my grandfather,
I pick one black candidate

39:59.428 --> 40:01.345
to make a sizeable donation to.

40:01.428 --> 40:03.762
There's also that big spread
in the Sun-Times.

40:03.845 --> 40:05.345
There's a bunch
of endorsements out there,

40:05.428 --> 40:07.011
but everybody knows
yours is the only one

40:07.095 --> 40:08.220
that really matters.

40:08.303 --> 40:10.095
[Douda]
That's why we're here.

40:10.178 --> 40:11.845
What's this?

40:11.929 --> 40:14.345
Proof that you two
are splitting the black vote.

40:14.428 --> 40:15.720
Now that's not possible.

40:15.804 --> 40:18.303
I got numbers this morning
that said I'm in the lead.

40:18.387 --> 40:21.011
You're leading
by a very slim margin.

40:21.095 --> 40:23.011
If one of you
doesn't drop out,

40:23.095 --> 40:25.095
then the other candidate
will end up being

40:25.178 --> 40:28.261
a non-black candidate,
and don't nobody want that.

40:28.345 --> 40:31.178
- I'm not dropping out.
- Neither am I.

40:31.261 --> 40:33.011
I've been thinking
long and hard

40:33.095 --> 40:34.762
about which one of you
to back.

40:34.845 --> 40:38.053
In all my history, I've never
backed the wrong candidate.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.011
But when it came down to it,

40:40.095 --> 40:43.303
I had to back someone
that was more like me.

40:44.762 --> 40:47.303
When I look at myself,
I see Otis,

40:47.387 --> 40:50.261
so my money's on him.

40:50.345 --> 40:52.220
You know, I think we need
a strong black man

40:52.303 --> 40:54.220
to lead this city.

40:54.303 --> 40:56.845
Camille,
I hope you can understand.

40:56.929 --> 40:58.053
Hm.

40:58.136 --> 41:00.428

41:00.512 --> 41:03.053
Y'all are trying
to Shirley Chisholm me.

41:03.136 --> 41:05.804
Black men turned their back
on her too,

41:05.887 --> 41:08.220
because they were intimidated
by her.

41:08.303 --> 41:10.887
They were afraid
of what she was capable of,

41:10.970 --> 41:14.303
but just like her, I'm gonna
rise like the phoenix,

41:14.387 --> 41:17.053
and my legacy
will never die,

41:17.136 --> 41:20.428
because that's just
the kind of bitch I am.

41:20.512 --> 41:22.428
