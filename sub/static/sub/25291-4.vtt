WEBVTT

00:47.000 --> 00:49.560
(Playful chatter and laughter)

00:51.360 --> 00:53.624
JEREMY: Get me!
SAM: Aaaah!

00:53.800 --> 00:55.665
DEMELZA: Jeremy, Jeremy!

00:56.960 --> 00:59.940
(Playful chatter and laughter continues)

01:03.000 --> 01:05.639
JEREMY: He's going to get you!

01:05.800 --> 01:08.542
Dr Enys, is this creature not provoking?

01:08.720 --> 01:10.938
Forcing me to sit out of the game?

01:11.120 --> 01:15.022
- Boring me to tears with her endless smiles?
- Most provoking.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.377
I live for the day the little beast runs away.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.699
I tell her I shan't miss her at all.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.506
Do they have such sport at Westminster?

01:37.680 --> 01:40.820
Oh, if only those games were as innocent!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.979
But is that not how Parliament works?

01:43.160 --> 01:45.617
And are you now not au fait with it all?

01:45.800 --> 01:48.462
I wish I knew what I'd actually achieved.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.859
Here, at least I can sleep at night
knowing I've been of use.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.669
Sometimes_I woncler
why I went there In the first place.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.547
- Then I'm reminded.
- To fight George?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.585
No.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.183
Just everything he represents.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.104
(Birdsong)

02:10.280 --> 02:12.419
This is a guinea. This a crown.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.818
And this is sixpence.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.627
Which do we prefer?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.119
The. . .crown?

02:19.280 --> 02:21.180
(Tuts) But see...

02:22.160 --> 02:24.469
Your crown to guinea.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.064
What does that tell you?

02:32.240 --> 02:33.662
Gold is best?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.385
- Good boy.
- Have we any left?

02:36.560 --> 02:39.063
After your expenditure on boroughs?

02:39.240 --> 02:40.787
Three-quarters of Saint Michael.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.464
The Scawen family owns the remaining portion
and have yet to be persuaded to part with it.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.267
Here.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.305
Your uncle thinks the bid extravagant.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.664
Oh, he would.
He's a blacksmith's son!

02:53.080 --> 02:54.980
And I a blacksmith's grandson.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.378
And had thought
my lack of pedigree well buried

02:57.560 --> 02:59.266
till two members of the ruling elite

02:59.440 --> 03:01.624
saw fit to close ranks against me.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.506
Basset and Falmouth?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.944
- I doubt that was their reason.
- What else would it be?

03:06.120 --> 03:07.940
Well, I did hear...

03:10.080 --> 03:12.867
You did hear...?

03:13.040 --> 03:14.985
As I understand it,

03:15.160 --> 03:17.663
Demelza spoke to each in turn and...

03:18.400 --> 03:21.267
...encouraged them to end their feud.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.620
So...

03:27.800 --> 03:32.817
thanks to the intervention
of that impudent kitchen trull,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.059
I must now spend a fortune

03:35.240 --> 03:38.266
in order to regain
my rightful place in Parliament?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.979
(Gulls cry)

03:54.920 --> 03:56.706
(Gurgles)

04:04.360 --> 04:06.737
Be not in haste to leave us, little one.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.499
Stay awhile longer.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.137
Do you think we'll ever truly mend?

04:35.360 --> 04:38.022
- Have we not mended?
- A little.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.459
'Tis like bone, Ross.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.663
Once it's broken,
darest we lean on it again?

04:46.840 --> 04:48.899
Surely we have peace now?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.139
Yes.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.345
I'm just afear'd that...

04:53.520 --> 04:55.977
_ one little storm
WIII scat us all t'mIdJans!

04:56.160 --> 04:58.139
Then we must take care.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.619
To avoid the thunder.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.179
(Birdsong)

05:16.640 --> 05:19.347
(inhales and exhales deeply)

05:44.200 --> 05:46.384
Captures something of him, does it not?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.899
Though I sometimes think
there were few who truly knew him.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.340
Dr Enys, perhaps?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.897
- Your wife?
- Hm.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.019
First term in Parliament...

06:00.600 --> 06:01.817
Period of learning.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.422
How the land lies.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.342
Who to mind. Who to ignore.
Who not to ignore.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.704
I've not attempted to influence your voting.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.862
But when you return
there will be...instances

06:13.040 --> 06:15.019
where your vote will be appreciated.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.224
(Pours drink)

06:16.400 --> 06:18.618
Small matters of local importance.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.382
A building scheme here, a new road there.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.739
Nothing too onerous.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.180
Do I make myself plain?

06:45.800 --> 06:47.779
(Horse whinnies)

06:51.160 --> 06:54.220
Hear now the comfortable words of St John:

06:54.400 --> 06:58.746
"Speak ye the truth
and the truth shall set you free."

06:59.760 --> 07:04.140
So...these people,
whose funds you've embezzled?

07:07.800 --> 07:09.904
The Au ketts.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.745
Trevanions.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.948
Noakes Pete.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.059
Robe/2‘ Ansell.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.704
VIM/27m Coat/7.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.337
And a// were secured at Pascoes Bank?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.423
Heaven forgive me.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.977
Yes. Excellent.

07:33.120 --> 07:39.457
Now, if Nat Pearce could oblige us further
and kindly bite the dust...

07:39.640 --> 07:42.780
So we may hasten
the demise of Pascoe's Bank.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.985
And, with it, the Poldark nest egg.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.187
- Do we know its present worth?
- Ah, not yet.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.179
- Morning.
- Morning.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.507
The other day...

08:12.720 --> 08:14.699
...at the beach...

08:15.800 --> 08:18.143
...you seemed out of sorts.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.279
Yes.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.665
- If you'd rather not discuss?
- I'd much rather not discuss.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.744
But there'll soon be no avoiding it.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.179
Sarah...

08:46.400 --> 08:47.867
...will not live.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.109
- What?
- She has a congenital defect of the heart.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.022
- My God.
- The irony.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.897
I see so many children
born into poverty and squalor.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.584
Yet my own child, born into luxury,

09:05.760 --> 09:09.457
raised...with all the care
and attention of a princess...

09:10.480 --> 09:12.220
...that such a child can be flawed.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.145
Does Caroline know?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.699
I can't tell her.

09:19.880 --> 09:23.429
I've thought endlessly
of how to break the news gently.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.988
But I cannot.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.980
The thing must take its course.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.861
But it's simply a question
of waiting for the first infection.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.940
Whether it comes this month,
this year or the next...

09:38.440 --> 09:41.420
...her heart will not have
the strength to meet it.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.979
My God, Dwight.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.987
- What can I do?
- Not tell Demelza.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.861
Not that she would say anything,
but her face would betray her.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.939
Ross? Blasting's all set.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.508
Ready to go below?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.979
We'll speak further.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.899
Go.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.505
And, Ross...

10:18.200 --> 10:20.179
Not a word to Demelza.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.107
No.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.024
(Approaching footsteps)

10:37.000 --> 10:38.740
(Distant explosion)

10:38.920 --> 10:40.865
That'll be Ross!

10:41.040 --> 10:45.739
Blastin' away so he may break through
to Maiden, and scuttle off back to London.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.583
I see no haste in him to do so.
Begumng as London IS.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.697
- Is it?
- You should see for yourself.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.859
I think you'd like it.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.340
Well, Ross haven't asked me.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.504
I shall ask you - if I ever return.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.864
Of which I see little prospect,
since I've become so dull and settled.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.020
Which I lay firmly at the door
of young Miss Enys.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.300
MORWENNA:
It's so kind of you to call.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.903
How could I go without seeing
my old governess?

11:15.080 --> 11:18.299
- How I've missed you!
- His stay has been all too brief.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.141
Uncle George might disagree.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.959
My sweet, you know relations
between you are much improved.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.680
- That's only because I'm never here.
- (Door opens)

11:34.560 --> 11:37.586
- (Door closes)
- My dear, is that a new nurse?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.978
Surely that's the...third in a year?

11:40.160 --> 11:42.139
Fourth.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.426
Forgive me, but...they all seem so grim.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.387
Would not some pleasant young person
be more suitable?

11:48.560 --> 11:50.266
You do not think of
another of your sisters?

11:50.440 --> 11:52.704
Lady Whitworth chooses them.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.541
And Lady Whitworth dismisses them.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.349
And Osborne agrees?
How strange.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.499
Osborne is a strange man.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.319
OSSIE: This cannot continue.

12:07.480 --> 12:12.258
Meeting in broad daylight when there's always
the chance some prying busybody...

12:14.600 --> 12:17.501
When does your husband visit his family?

12:17.680 --> 12:21.025
Every Thursday at eight, for three hours.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.464
That might be the better arrangement.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.219
Whatever you say...Vicar.

12:29.080 --> 12:33.380
Of course, you realise our...association
is purely temporary.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.545
As soon as my wife sees fit
to resume marital relations.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.699
In the meantime, Vicar,

12:39.880 --> 12:42.667
you might have noticed
how threadbare is the rug?

12:43.200 --> 12:45.179
And the cushions in the parlour.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.058
You...

12:52.240 --> 12:55.698
are a vile, acquisitive harlot.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.519
And I can't think
how I came to be ensnared by you!

12:58.680 --> 12:59.749
(Sfliggers)

13:02.600 --> 13:05.626
Oh, Osborne. ls Rowella in?

13:05.800 --> 13:08.382
She is er...indisposed.

13:08.560 --> 13:13.759
I came myself, hoping to mediate
between the sisters, but she sent me away.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.262
Would you excuse me?

13:15.440 --> 13:18.102
My wife becomes distressed
if I'm away too long.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.985
Ah! Master Geoffrey!

13:39.160 --> 13:41.139
(They mush)

13:43.000 --> 13:45.104
I can't get over how grown up 'ee be!

13:45.280 --> 13:46.781
With pursuits to match.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.858
Oh, do I shock you?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.977
Well, that, I 'spicion, was your intent!

13:54.880 --> 13:58.543
Master Geoffrey...
I'm not like your new friends.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.742
'Tis not in me to speak of...
drinkin' an' gamblin' an' women.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.779
No, you are right.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.139
So perhaps we should be strangers now.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.461
For my new friends belong to the worlds
of eminence and fashion.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.107
And among such friends are those
who have freed me from the bonds of Trenwith

14:20.280 --> 14:21.702
and Nampara and Sawle.

14:21.880 --> 14:25.657
But the one from whom I require
undying friendship...

14:27.280 --> 14:29.305
...is Blacksmith Came.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.459
An' you shall 'ave it, Master Geoffrey.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.619
For as long as you live.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.779
(Sizzling)

14:40.040 --> 14:42.019
I saw Morwenna today.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.979
I couldn't get a word alone,
to tell her I was coming to see you.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.542
Ah, 'tis as well.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.497
There's no point resurrecting
something long since dead.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.500
She has her life to live.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.898
And I 'ave mine.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.021
- Life must go on.
- Yes.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.304
I'm glad to hear you say so.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.981
SAM: Can't be far now.
ROSS: The other side of this rock.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.505
ZACKY: By tomorrow we'll be through.
I'll wager my house on it.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.817
(Chuckling)

15:32.000 --> 15:34.867
DEMELZA: The blastin' went well?
- Hm. Most well.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.258
Tomorrow we dig again.
An' Cap'n Ross an' I,

15:37.440 --> 15:40.625
we feel it in our bones,
reward be close at hand.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.220
Oh! Beggin' your pardon,
I thought 'twas only Mistress.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.300
Are you bound for Sawle again, Rosina?

15:48.480 --> 15:50.789
Drake could carry that basket.
Could you not, brother?

15:52.760 --> 15:55.103
Willingly, sister.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.659
Fine day for a walk.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.899
'Tis so.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.577
I lately learnt a new word.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.739
Pro-pin-quit—y.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.785
And what will you do with this word?

16:25.960 --> 16:27.700
That's just it.
You don't do anything.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.940
You just...arrange things,
so that something might happen.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.180
And then you wait
to see if something does.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.508
(Demelza laughs)

16:52.600 --> 16:55.307
Brother of yours, Preacher Came,
775 a rare good man.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.459
I do think so.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.460
Are 'ee Methody?

17:00.640 --> 17:03.017
No, but I go to church Sundays.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.699
Oh.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.746
Have 'ee known my sister a long while?

17:11.920 --> 17:14.343
And I 'ave much to thank her for.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.660
For she did tell me of Dr Enys
an' he did mend my lipsy leg.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.979
- Praise the Lord.
- Amen.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.226
I can manage from here.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.426
We'm close to Sawle,
an' if folk see us walkin' t'gether...

17:28.600 --> 17:30.704
'Twill be thought we're courtin'?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.099
Folk can think what they like.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.021
Dr Enys.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.179
Most opportune!

18:26.360 --> 18:28.339
May I consult you about my wife?

18:30.760 --> 18:32.148
If you wish.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.778
Of late I've noted
a marked deterioration in her behaviour.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.279
Periods of profound melancholy,

18:39.440 --> 18:43.137
suffers increasingly
from the most alarming delusions...

18:43.920 --> 18:46.787
...and continues to_refuse me
my conjugal rights.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.023
All of which leads me to conclude
that she's beyond help

18:50.200 --> 18:52.145
and_would be_ better off
In an Institution.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.027
- An asylum?
-Abs

18:55.200 --> 18:58.749
Sir, as Mrs Whitworth's husband, you are,
of course, entitled to have her put away.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.263
But...l question why you would wish to.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.658
She performs her household
and parish duties admirably.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.819
Her conjugal duties, don't you see?

19:07.920 --> 19:09.626
As you know, sir,

19:09.800 --> 19:13.907
I'm in holy orders
and therefore my position is delicate.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.546
If I took the step of incarcerating my wife,
possibly for life,

19:19.720 --> 19:23.019
I'd be reluctant to have the matter
come to the attention of the Bishop,

19:23.200 --> 19:26.499
or my parishioners,
if I alone was responsible.

19:27.600 --> 19:33.061
That's why the sanction of a physician
is of the utmost importance.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.219
I see that, sir.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.423
And I trust you will not easily find such a man.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.419
(Sarah coughs)

20:00.960 --> 20:02.825
(Sarah grizzles)

20:03.000 --> 20:04.979
Ssh, ssh.

20:12.200 --> 20:16.227
Oh, Dr Enys,
Madam Minx has been so tiresome today.

20:16.400 --> 20:21.383
Scarcely any smiles - and forcing out
the strangest little cough just to be annoying.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.199
- Cough?
- (Sarah grizzles)

20:24.360 --> 20:26.339
May I see her?

20:27.160 --> 20:29.264
(Sarah coughs and grizzles)

20:33.960 --> 20:35.939
(Sarah cries)

20:44.240 --> 20:47.425
- I think it's nothing serious.
- Of course not.

20:47.600 --> 20:51.297
Only madam's attempt to take more attention
of mine than she has already.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.139
(Grizzles)

21:05.600 --> 21:07.579
(Birdsong)

21:16.760 --> 21:19.627
Must you be in such haste
to leave our bed?

21:19.800 --> 21:22.382
I'm in haste to embrace another Maiden!

21:23.280 --> 21:25.384
Less accommodating than this one.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.585
I believe she'll surrender in the end.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.739
And when she do, I'd like to be there!

21:30.480 --> 21:33.119
- Above grass.
- I know my place!

21:33.280 --> 21:37.159
In the mine office.
Got my own chaIr an' a peg to hang my coat!

21:37.880 --> 21:41.065
It comforts me to know, when I'm in London,
the mine's in safe hands.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.097
Is that why you don't ask me
to come with you?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.379
Breakfast?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.503
GEORGE: Good boy.
- (Driver urges on horses)

22:09.720 --> 22:14.498
At least when you return to Parliament,
we'll see more of Geoffrey Charles in London.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.942
And meanwhile,
we have our own son to cherish.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.784
How many pence in a shilling?
Shall we go and count?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.348
Yes, Papa.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.069
SAM: Good day to 'ee, brother.
- Morning.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.379
(Lively chatter)

22:51.200 --> 22:53.942
Blessed Lord, look kindly on our ventures

22:54.120 --> 22:56.987
which we dedicate to the glory
of Thy holy name.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.459
ROSS: Do you hear anything from Emma?

23:04.240 --> 23:06.458
Is she maid at Tehidy still?

23:06.640 --> 23:08.107
Yes, brother.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.986
'Tis a year since she left, and er...

23:10.160 --> 23:13.982
next week be the time she says she'll give me
her answer: will we be wed or no.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.299
Are you hopeful?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.702
Reckon so.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.859
(Both laugh)

23:33.800 --> 23:38.863
Dr Enys...
it's rare that I seek a second opinion.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.667
I recall.

23:40.840 --> 23:45.743
But since I have been urged by Mr Whitworth
to sanction his wife's committal

23:45.920 --> 23:47.820
to a mental institution...

23:48.000 --> 23:51.549
You would not wish to do so without
the endorsement of another phySICIan.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.700
- Quite.
- I have one stipulation.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.587
- I must examine Mrs Whitworth alone.
- Preposterous!

24:01.000 --> 24:03.025
Pray do.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.139
(Gentle knocking, door opens)

24:11.400 --> 24:13.379
Dr Enys!

24:14.160 --> 24:17.744
You know, do you not, that it was never my wish
that your services be dispensed with?

24:17.920 --> 24:21.697
Of course. I'm sorry that I return
under such unhappy circumstances.

24:21.880 --> 24:25.862
- Do you know what my husband believes?
- It IsIW/Iat
believe which matters here.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.381
(Exhales heavily)

24:28.560 --> 24:31.427
What can you mean, Madam Mischief?

24:31.600 --> 24:36.424
Our guest will be bored witless if you lie still
and only make that tiresome rasping sound!

24:36.600 --> 24:38.943
- Is she sick?
- The merest of colds.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.827
- But Dwight's not concerned?
- Dwight's always concerned.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.026
Sarah's his little princess.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.946
Gentlemen, I've examined Mrs Whitworth
and talked with her at length.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.543
I have looked for indication
that she may be losing her reason.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.823
I've found none.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.742
And this...is all you have to say?

24:56.920 --> 24:58.979
No, sir, it is not.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.663
You have a wife
who must be regarded as delicate.

25:01.840 --> 25:05.469
In my opinion, what she needs is care,
kindness and consideration.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.540
Are you suggesting
she does not receive these?

25:07.720 --> 25:09.824
- That's not for me to say.
- (Blows nose)

25:10.600 --> 25:13.501
May I remind you that she threatened
to murder our son?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.103
You've said so. _
But has she ever made any move towards It?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.309
And mayI remind you
that the Church's view on insanity

25:22.480 --> 25:24.220
is that it is God's judgment
upon the wicked.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.903
A view that has recently been shaken
by the King's own madness.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.504
Might I suggest it would be treason
to argue that His Majesty's insanity

25:30.680 --> 25:33.501
was brought on by his own evil ways?

25:33.680 --> 25:35.386
The problem, Dr Enys...

25:35.560 --> 25:39.747
is that Mrs Whitworth
is refusing to fulfil her conjugal duties.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.663
- Exactly! Hence my suffering!
- Dr Choake, I don't deny the problem,

25:43.840 --> 25:46.707
but is it one we can take
profeSSIonal steps to resolve?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.781
We are asked to provide a diagnosis
confirming Mr Whitworth's view

25:49.960 --> 25:52.224
that his wife is insane
and must be put away.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.901
- My answer is no...
- (Exhales)

25:54.080 --> 25:55.468
...as yours must surely be.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.664
I cannot help you, sir.
Nor do I wish to.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.981
It's my humble opinion that if a husband cannot
win his wife by loving kindness and sympathy,

26:05.160 --> 26:06.741
then he deserves to go without her.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.180
I bid you both good day.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.339
(inhales and exhales deeply)

26:15.640 --> 26:17.619
insolent pup!

26:20.120 --> 26:22.623
(Grunting)

26:30.840 --> 26:32.819
Sam.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.987
Does that feel moist to you?

26:42.040 --> 26:44.019
SAM: Brother?

26:47.560 --> 26:49.539
(Trickling)

26:54.040 --> 26:56.463
Get everyone out. Now!

26:57.640 --> 26:58.902
(Tools clatter)

26:59.080 --> 27:01.662
SAM: Get out!
WORKER: What is it?

27:01.840 --> 27:04.024
- There's a flood!
- Get up to grass! Now!

27:04.200 --> 27:05.701
Everyone out!

27:05.880 --> 27:07.859
(Trickling)

27:10.040 --> 27:11.905
- (Clatter)
- Get up to grass!

27:12.080 --> 27:14.059
(Water gushes)

27:15.440 --> 27:17.021
ROSS: Go. Above to grass!

27:17.200 --> 27:18.986
- Sam, will you warn the others?
- Where'll 'ee go?

27:19.160 --> 27:20.980
Down to 30 level.
It'll be the first to flood.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.139
Go!
_ (Shollting)

27:28.360 --> 27:29.861
(Water crashing)

27:30.040 --> 27:32.907
SAM: There's a flood!
Waste no time!

27:33.080 --> 27:34.945
Get up to the shaft now! Come on!

27:38.680 --> 27:40.420
ROSS: Everyone out!
There's a flood!

27:40.600 --> 27:42.386
- Is anyone else down here?
- I can't be sure, sir.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.120
Out! Out! Is anyone down here?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.819
(Water gushing)

27:54.720 --> 27:57.177
SAM: Make haste afore she floods.
-(Shouﬁng)

28:05.720 --> 28:06.903
(Jangliflg)

28:08.120 --> 28:09.587
Flood! There's a flood!

28:09.760 --> 28:12.183
(Panicked shouting)

28:15.400 --> 28:17.960
ROSS: Zaclq! Bobby!
There's a flood!

28:18.120 --> 28:19.542
- Where?
- 20 level.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.039
The shaft's filling up already!

28:21.200 --> 28:22.827
- Is anyone else down there?
- Nay, it's just we!

28:23.000 --> 28:24.979
Hurry. Hurry!

28:39.400 --> 28:42.779
- Mine bell's a-ringin', maid!
- Oh, Judas!

28:43.120 --> 28:44.439
Mind the children!

28:44.600 --> 28:46.579
(Cries)

28:50.320 --> 28:54.859
Dr Enys, you do fuss over that child.
She has a cold.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.179
Even I know that's not the end of the world.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.021
No.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.861
But, for Sarah, it will be.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.819
What on earth do you mean?

29:10.440 --> 29:12.749
Flood! Flood at th' mine!

29:14.360 --> 29:16.464
This is a very strange jest, Dr Enys.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.986
Ask yourself, my love.
Is this something I would joke about?

29:23.920 --> 29:25.660
(Approaching footsteps)

29:32.360 --> 29:35.022
From the mine - there's a flood.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.029
I must go. I'm sorry.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.065
Of course you must.
What else would you do?

29:40.240 --> 29:42.219
(Sarah coughs)

29:46.520 --> 29:48.499
(Sarah grizzles)

29:55.240 --> 29:59.188
Isn't Papa amusing?
What a vivid imagination he has.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.625
(Bell ringing)

30:12.800 --> 30:13.869
(Panﬁng)

30:23.240 --> 30:24.707
Hurry!

30:24.880 --> 30:26.097
Zacky! Make haste!

30:26.280 --> 30:29.306
- (Grunts)
ROSS: Up to grass! Get up!

30:29.480 --> 30:31.584
Hurry!

30:31.760 --> 30:34.069
- Keep going!
ZACKY: Make haste, nephew!

30:38.640 --> 30:40.619
ROSS: Is anyone else down there?

30:41.600 --> 30:43.386
(Bobby screams)

30:44.240 --> 30:46.504
- (Splash)
ZACKY: Bobby!

30:46.680 --> 30:48.659
ROSS: Bobby!

30:50.400 --> 30:52.379
(Muffled cries)

30:59.760 --> 31:02.399
- I must go after 'im!
- No! Go to grass!

31:05.040 --> 31:07.417
- He's not coming out!
- I'll go!

31:07.600 --> 31:09.465
I'll go get him!

31:09.640 --> 31:11.619
(Grunting)

31:55.960 --> 31:57.939
(Gasps for breath)

32:00.400 --> 32:03.221
Is anybody up there? Zacky?

32:03.600 --> 32:05.306
(Bell continues ringing)

32:07.920 --> 32:09.501
- Where's Ross?
- Still below.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.386
And Sam?

32:22.760 --> 32:24.739
Can anybody help?

32:26.760 --> 32:28.625
- Are any wounded?
- None so far, sir.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.542
_ _ - But not all are out. _ _
- DWIght, Is this not the most terrIble thing?

32:31.720 --> 32:34.097
- How many still below?
- Four. And among 'em, Ross and Sam!

32:34.280 --> 32:35.304
Dear God.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.040
-(Panﬂng)
- Zacky's out.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.979
Help us!

33:00.920 --> 33:02.820
Help us! Help!

33:03.760 --> 33:07.218
ROSS: Brother, help!
SAM: Take the rope, brother.

33:07.840 --> 33:09.626
Take it!

33:17.240 --> 33:19.219
Quickly. Quickly.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.679
- Bobby?
- Ross! Where's Ross?

33:24.040 --> 33:26.747
- Oh, my love!
- (Panting) Is he dead?

33:37.600 --> 33:38.919
(Grunts)

33:41.040 --> 33:42.257
(Grunts)

33:44.160 --> 33:45.900
- (Grunts)
DEMELZA: Oh!

33:46.080 --> 33:47.866
Bobby. Bobby.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.702
- Bobby.
- Dwight. Dwight. Leave him.

33:50.880 --> 33:53.189
- Bobby.
- Nothing. It's no use.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.339
- Leave him.
- Move!

33:58.760 --> 34:00.625
Come on. Come on.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.620
(Grunts)

34:02.800 --> 34:04.586
Come on, Bobby.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.344
(Muttering)

34:09.520 --> 34:11.499
DWIGHT: Oh! (Panting)

34:12.240 --> 34:14.504
(Dwight moans)
Come on, Bobby. Come on.

34:26.640 --> 34:28.028
(Breath hisses)

34:29.240 --> 34:30.423
Come on!

34:31.200 --> 34:33.179
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

34:36.400 --> 34:37.947
- (Bobby gasps for air)
-(Shouﬁng)

34:38.120 --> 34:40.259
- Quickly! Quickly!
- He's alive. He's alive!

34:40.440 --> 34:42.419
- Fetch him a blanket.
- Blanket!

34:42.600 --> 34:44.864
- Someone get a blanket!
- Get him warm.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.705
- The salts.
- You're safe, boy.

34:49.200 --> 34:52.863
- Dwight, you really can work miracles.
- Oh, I wish that were true.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.547
- Thank you.
- I think the men you should be thanking...

34:58.720 --> 35:00.142
are there and there.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.299
(Sam exhales heavily)

35:04.640 --> 35:06.619
I thought I'd lost 'ee.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.099
(Wind gently whistling)

35:27.520 --> 35:29.260
Sam.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.789
I come to give 'ee my answer, Sam.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.265
(Chuckles) I'd almost forgot
what 'ee look'd like.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.941
I wanted 'ee to hear it from me,
not by letter.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.946
I be going to marry Ned Artnel.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.979
Second Footman at Tehidy.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.468
He's a kind man.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.099
Not wild like Tom...

36:03.600 --> 36:05.465
...nor pure like thee.

36:07.320 --> 36:11.097
Oh, Sam, if it were simply a matter of lovin',
then you an' I'd be wed.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.865
But it ain't that simple.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.304
For I'm a loud, brazen girl.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.903
An' you...you're a preacher,

36:19.080 --> 36:21.719
an' folk would look askance
if you were to wed a girl like me.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.144
Let 'em think what they like! Emma?

36:24.920 --> 36:26.387
Nay, Sam.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.379
For I did give Ned Artnel my word.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.019
Though not my heart.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.783
- For that I already give to thee.
- Emma.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.819
God bless thee, Sam.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.864
(Tearfully) I will never forget thee.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.589
(Footstep)

37:01.760 --> 37:03.387
Listen to this.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.586
"Sometimes,
when a new adit is brought to an old mine,

37:06.760 --> 37:11.424
they have holed unexpectedly to the house
of water and have instantly perished."

37:13.240 --> 37:15.185
"Great caution should therefore be taken,

37:15.360 --> 37:18.659
so that before breaking ground
they have timely notice of water."

37:18.840 --> 37:22.025
"This advice may not be relished
by those who value money

37:22.200 --> 37:24.020
more than the lives
of their fellow creatures."

37:24.200 --> 37:26.339
Ross, that is not us!

37:26.520 --> 37:28.738
Since when do we put profit
ahead of our workers?

37:28.920 --> 37:31.627
Still...it makes for uncomfortable reading.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.779
Then don't read it!

37:37.640 --> 37:39.221
(Approaching footsteps)

37:39.400 --> 37:41.539
Master Jeremy's askin' for 'ee, maid.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.859
His cold is worse.
Should I send for Dr Enys?

37:44.040 --> 37:46.543
No, no. Don't bother him.
Sarah's also sick.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.377
- Is she?
- Oh, it's only a cold.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.937
Caroline says Dwight's fussin' over nothin'.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.107
I think I must return to the mine...
and assess the damage.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.539
I'll be home before supper.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.460
Demelza says Sarah's ill.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.824
She has a cold.

38:20.800 --> 38:24.429
- Is that all?
- It will be enough.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.299
Dear God.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.984
Does Caroline know?

38:31.160 --> 38:33.139
Yes, Caroline knows.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.617
And is taking it in her stride, with all the dignity
and stoicism of a lady of breeding.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.382
Caroline...will you not take some brandy?

38:40.560 --> 38:43.120
Why? Is there something to celebrate?

38:47.640 --> 38:50.939
You know, Ross...
I never wanted this wretched creature.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.021
But over the months she has wormed
her way Into my affections,

38:54.200 --> 38:56.179
supplanting even poor Horace.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.782
Do you know...how long?

39:02.200 --> 39:04.509
A matter of hours.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.744
God in heaven.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.982
- I should have brought Demelza.
- No.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.747
No, I am a hard woman
and I can fend for myself.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.584
Demelza does not understand
restraint and dignity.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.864
I believe Demelza would cry.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.600
And that, I fear, would undo us all.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.179
DWIGHT: My love.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.659
My darling.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.059
(Tearfully) She's gone.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.542
Will you not let me take her from you?

40:19.240 --> 40:21.219
No.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.019
I'd have her stay with me awhile.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.579
(SObs)

41:20.600 --> 41:22.579
(Church bell tolling)

42:24.160 --> 42:27.140
(Sobs) It do feel to me
like the end of the world.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.960
Like losin' Julia all over again.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.379
Is she all you're reminded of?

42:38.400 --> 42:40.379
Not Hugh?

42:43.640 --> 42:45.619
You ask me that now?

42:46.560 --> 42:48.744
After all this time, you still doubt me?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.706
Perhaps I doubt everything!

42:51.480 --> 42:53.664
MY Purpose, my use.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.779
The wisdom of returning to London.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.345
- The wisdom of going there in the first place.
- Are you not obliged to return?

43:02.520 --> 43:04.181
Yes.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.100
Iam.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.542
(inhales and exhales heavily)

43:07.720 --> 43:09.699
But what of my obligations here?

43:12.960 --> 43:15.463
GEORGE: So Parliament has resumed...

43:17.040 --> 43:19.497
...without the Dishonourable
Member for Truro.

43:21.320 --> 43:26.098
Falmouth must be delighted.
Not that Ross ever did his bidding.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.861
Did you ever do Basset's?

43:29.160 --> 43:30.297
(Scoffs)

43:30.480 --> 43:32.584
So Ross and I have something in common!

43:34.320 --> 43:37.221
And soon...we'l| have more.

43:39.640 --> 43:42.746
The Scawens -
for all their illustrious heritage -

43:42.920 --> 43:46.981
were not immune to the inducements
of a blacksmith's boy.

43:47.160 --> 43:50.106
- You are not that.
- I was.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.819
And have spent my life denying it.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.418
But now I think it has given me sinew.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.819
And a disinclination to be beat.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.421
So...do you now own all of Saint Michael?

44:06.520 --> 44:08.545
I do.

44:08.720 --> 44:12.349
And all that remains is to remove
one of its two MPs - and step into his seat.

44:14.280 --> 44:17.784
And for a blacksmith's boy...
how hard can that be?

44:22.640 --> 44:24.426
(Chuckles)

44:31.720 --> 44:34.905
- Bad as you feared?
- No. Worse.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.506
The tunnels are block'd,
timber supports wash'd away.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.319
Pumping rods shattered,
and all below the 30 level's under water.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.744
ZACKY: It'll take months...

44:44.360 --> 44:45.861
ROSS: We don't have months.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.907
How do a hundred families survive
without this mine?

44:49.080 --> 44:52.504
But how will 'ee pay 'em
if all they bring up is mud an' stones?

44:58.160 --> 45:00.139
(Birdsong)

45:20.400 --> 45:23.665
My love...I've been thinking.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.743
Are we not taking all this
too much to heart?

45:27.520 --> 45:30.227
Children die every day,
and the fact that this one was ours

45:30.400 --> 45:34.029
and we esteemed it above all others,
shows a miserable lack of proportion.

45:34.920 --> 45:37.104
Besides, I was never meant to be a mother.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.699
You know that is nonsense.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.982
You've been an excellent one.

45:43.160 --> 45:45.139
- And I hope will be so again.
- No.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.299
That I cannot do.

45:48.520 --> 45:51.819
Dwight...l want to leave you.

45:53.840 --> 45:56.866
- What do you mean?
- Not for ever, but...

45:57.600 --> 45:59.579
I feel that I have failed.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.907
Failed you.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.866
Myself...

46:06.040 --> 46:07.826
...her.

46:08.560 --> 46:12.940
And while I remain in this house
with...all of its reminders...

46:14.360 --> 46:17.102
...I feel I will never come to grips with...

46:17.840 --> 46:21.583
...what it is that I need
in order...to forget.

46:23.160 --> 46:25.902
- You cannot wish that.
- Not her.

46:27.480 --> 46:31.223
The lack of her, the loss of her.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.543
Where will you go?

46:37.720 --> 46:40.097
To London.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.145
- For a month or so.
- May I not come With you?

46:42.320 --> 46:43.901
And abandon your patients?

46:44.080 --> 46:47.664
- If it were just a month...
- It will not be just a month.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.905
(Approaching footsteps)

46:57.120 --> 46:58.587
From Falmouth.

46:59.640 --> 47:03.519
I wrote informing him
I wouldn't be returning to London just yet.

47:03.680 --> 47:04.863
And?

47:05.040 --> 47:10.706
He makes it clear that when I do,
I'll be expected to toe the line.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.507
Particularly on his behalf.

47:12.680 --> 47:14.659
(Signs)

47:18.400 --> 47:20.379
Are we sure about this?

47:21.800 --> 47:26.146
_ To ransack our own coffers _
In order to see this mine open again?

47:26.320 --> 47:28.299
Woah!

47:29.720 --> 47:31.699
Do we have a choice?

47:32.600 --> 47:36.297
Well, we could close the mine, remove
ourselves to London and forget Cornwall exists.

47:36.480 --> 47:38.186
Hm! Yes, Ross.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.339
I see that's an option.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.619
(Both chuckle)

48:00.400 --> 48:03.699
Now, Dr Enys,
do your best not to miss Horace.

48:04.720 --> 48:08.668
I will do my best...not to miss Horace.

48:27.400 --> 48:29.186
(Whip cracks)

48:46.200 --> 48:47.986
So good of you to spare me your time

48:48.160 --> 48:50.378
before you return to Westminster,
Captain Howell.

48:50.560 --> 48:53.120
Tell me, is not London damnably expensive?

48:53.280 --> 48:55.259
And without private means,

48:55.440 --> 48:58.944
one wonders what could persuade
a man to leave Cornwall at all!

49:00.200 --> 49:04.739
And, therefore,
what might induce him to stay.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.059
(Gulls cry)

49:28.200 --> 49:30.418
Know where she be headed?

49:30.600 --> 49:32.579
Same as we?

49:33.120 --> 49:35.099
Hm. This be sister's doin'.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.778
Very like. Do 'ee object?

49:38.960 --> 49:40.746
Yes.

49:41.640 --> 49:44.200
No. (Laughs)

49:46.600 --> 49:48.181
Rosina!

49:59.560 --> 50:01.539
DRAKE: Are you well?

50:27.040 --> 50:29.258
DRAKE: Raargh!
- (Laughter)

50:34.240 --> 50:36.617
(Chatter and laughter)

50:37.800 --> 50:39.267
(Chuckles)

50:50.640 --> 50:52.619
Shall we take some air?

51:16.840 --> 51:21.027
Everyone has their trials and tribulations.
It's how one chooses to respond.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.339
- How do you respond?
- Oh, you know...

51:24.360 --> 51:28.421
By gritting my teeth in the day
and weeping into my pillow at night.

51:28.600 --> 51:32.377
Caroline, meanwhile,
prefers horses, assemblies and gowns.

51:33.440 --> 51:36.420
- You?
- Oh, you've seen me.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.106
Frenzied, back-breaking,
all-consuming activity!

51:40.280 --> 51:42.259
Doing...never dwelling.

51:43.280 --> 51:46.101
Sometimes I think
I've welcomed this mine disaster.

51:46.280 --> 51:49.625
- It's been a useful distraction.
- How long Will this distraction continue?

51:49.800 --> 51:51.665
Until I find a reason for it to stop.

51:52.560 --> 51:54.061
DWIGHT: Enemy territory.

51:56.560 --> 51:59.222
And typical of everything he stands for.

52:04.920 --> 52:07.229
Oh...

52:07.400 --> 52:09.504
George is neglecting his defences.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.459
- How careless of him.
- Ross.

52:14.800 --> 52:17.701
You think I'm the only one
who objects to these barricades?

52:17.880 --> 52:21.338
No, but I think you have particular grievances
which others do not.

52:21.520 --> 52:24.978
Is it not my duty
as an elected Member of Parliament

52:25.160 --> 52:26.741
to be the mouthpiece of my constituents?

52:26.920 --> 52:29.377
- (Thud)
- The mouthpiece, perhaps. But the hand?

52:29.560 --> 52:31.107
Or the foot?

52:31.280 --> 52:33.225
(Bird flutters away)

52:35.640 --> 52:37.858
(Grunting)

52:44.120 --> 52:47.339
I agree.
Fine behaviour for a politician!

52:48.720 --> 52:51.507
If I may call oneself such,
outside of Parliament.

52:54.240 --> 52:56.743
Verity would say I suffer from
the curse of the Poldarks!

52:56.920 --> 52:59.343
- Which is?
- A swiftness to anger.

53:00.200 --> 53:04.148
Readiness to hold a grievance.
Inability to compromise.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.778
That's three curses!
And are any of them true?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.945
I rest my case.

53:11.120 --> 53:15.386
I've not given this much thought, but my sense is
that anger is not always destructive.

53:15.560 --> 53:18.381
It can even be good, if properly directed.

53:18.560 --> 53:21.506
Yes. You may be right.

53:23.080 --> 53:25.344
I should learn to burn it in a better cause.

53:28.600 --> 53:31.023
Hm. I wonder who this belonged to?

53:31.760 --> 53:35.423
(Scoffs) Another man.
From another life.

53:36.680 --> 53:38.659
And is he sorry to return?

53:41.200 --> 53:43.179
Yes and no.

53:43.800 --> 53:47.224
And did he not once say
that to effect greater change,

53:47.400 --> 53:49.982
he must do so from a grander stage?

53:50.520 --> 53:51.703
He did.

53:51.880 --> 53:55.543
And is that "grander stage"
not one he find just a little...

53:56.800 --> 54:00.099
What's the word?
..IntOXIcating?

54:03.560 --> 54:05.505
Sometimes.

54:05.680 --> 54:10.105
And is that world not _one he wish
to keep to himself a little longer?

54:14.400 --> 54:19.702
Only because I could not achieve
all I hope to there...

54:20.960 --> 54:23.337
...without you in place of me here.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.865
And soon...

54:26.600 --> 54:28.579
...we will go there together.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.782
The Member of Parliament for Saint Michael,

54:46.960 --> 54:50.418
Captain Howell, has surrendered.

54:51.680 --> 54:54.626
I have his assurance
he will stand down at the next election.

54:56.560 --> 55:00.223
- So we'll return to London.
- And Westminster.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.498
And Ross Poldark
had better look over his shoulder

55:03.680 --> 55:06.387
because I am fast approaching
in his wake.

55:12.080 --> 55:15.743
- Will you watch over Demelza for me?
- I think she intends to watch over me.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.457
And I'll do my best
to bring Caroline back to you.

55:19.640 --> 55:21.619
As you did once before.

55:33.880 --> 55:36.144
- Write to me.
- Write to me!

55:37.000 --> 55:40.140
I want to hear everything
that happens to those I love most.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.939
(Horse whinnies)

56:03.520 --> 56:05.499
(Ross urges on horse)

56:08.080 --> 56:10.742
- Here we are. Deserted.
- Abandoned.

56:12.200 --> 56:14.509
Well, we must try to make the best of it.

56:15.760 --> 56:18.502
Yes. We must try to make the best.

56:24.240 --> 56:29.303
