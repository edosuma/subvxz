01:34.280 --> 01:39.115
You know what they say? The minute they
look at you, bingo, they can read your mind.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.033
- You fall for that stuff?
- I'm telling you!

01:42.120 --> 01:46.159
So this is where you've
been hiding. Everybody's upstairs.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.869
Anyway, so, as I was telling you,
I met this psychic...

01:59.760 --> 02:03.389
Well, if it isn't my favorite
sister and brother act.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.235
- Glad you could make it.
- So am I.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.038
You know me. Regular party animal.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.038
So is Dad here yet?

02:13.120 --> 02:16.476
When I left the office
he said he'd be here in 20 minutes.

02:16.560 --> 02:20.838
- That was two hours ago.
- He can spend an entire holiday in the lab.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.273
Yeah.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.156
Uh... I guess I'm off to mingle.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.875
Come here, I got something for you.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.956
Oh, wait, wait.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.190
Merry Christmas.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.633
Alex.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.752
It's beautiful.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.633
- Put it on.
- Help me.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.357
- I bet you believe in Santa too.
- Give me a break.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.910
No, but it's true. This cousin of mine,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.630
he knows a guy that was scanned by one
of them at a convention in Des Moines.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.757
- You guys are talking scanners?
- We're talking science fiction.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.752
Oh, yeah? Hey, Alex!

03:25.800 --> 03:29.759
- What's up, buddy?
- These guys don't believe in scanners.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.796
Oh, yeah? Well, they're right.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.835
Don't mind Santa,
he gets a little crazy this time of year.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.514
Alex, make believers out of these guys.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.512
Come on, give me a break,
it's Christmas Eve.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.472
Party pooper.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.952
Ooh!

03:51.040 --> 03:54.271
That's it. Come on, now,
give me one of those.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.636
You know, come on now.
Let's show these guys.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.792
- You're not gonna leave me alone, Taylor.
- Do it.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.678
- You ready?
- Come on, I'm ready.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.550
All right. Hold on to your beard.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.480
Whoa.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.031
You can do better than that.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.152
Whoa!

04:47.960 --> 04:50.155
Man, this guy's incredible.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.991
Come on.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.715
Like I told you, these guys are fantastic.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.678
No!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.592
No!

05:06.680 --> 05:08.591
Look, Mommy.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.031
Taylor!

05:50.920 --> 05:55.471
'Even if I was declared not guilty
for what they called an accident,

05:55.560 --> 05:57.516
'I had no choice but to leave.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.154
'I couldn't face my friends, or Joyce.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.835
'And I couldn't face the man that adopted
me and my friend Helena,

06:05.920 --> 06:09.629
'taking us out of that horrible
scanners institution.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.512
'I had to find a way to master my powers.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.912
'I went around the world

06:17.000 --> 06:19.798
'and finally found a place,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.836
'a monastery in Thailand.'

06:27.920 --> 06:31.276
I can't believe you talked
a Polish girl into lingerie.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.636
- I thought it was just for hookers.
- Come on, Helena.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.872
It's the '90s. We're women, we're strong,
and we can do whatever we want.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.916
Where am I supposed to wear it?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.956
Under your clothes.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.594
To work, anywhere you feel like it.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.150
Just imagine you and your new boss,
the takeover king.

06:50.240 --> 06:55.633
Mark Dragon. Maybe you two could hit it off -
takeover king meets makeover queen.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.995
Sounds like a match made in heaven.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.913
Unfortunately, I'm not interested.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.310
I know it sounds crazy.
It's been almost two years

07:04.400 --> 07:07.597
but even after all this time
I'm still hung up on Alex.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.198
Helena, are you all right?

07:15.280 --> 07:19.034
No, not again...
These damn migraines.

07:19.120 --> 07:23.272
Any time I get in a crowd
or any pressure situation, I get paralyzed.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.352
No wonder I can't hold a job.
How am I supposed to?

07:26.440 --> 07:29.557
Let's get you home.
I know a short cut back to the car.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.029
This is what always happens
when I forget my pills.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.839
Shouldn't you take them every day?

07:36.920 --> 07:41.232
Yes, but they make me stupid like
a sleepwalker. Almost anything is better.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.158
Let's get out of here.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.993
Well, well, well, what have we got here?

07:49.080 --> 07:52.038
Two uptown babes walking down my street.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.193
Whatever you're doing
is none of our business so just let us go.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.352
Didn't you know
it was dangerous in this part of town?

07:59.440 --> 08:02.512
You don't want to do this,
you'll just get into trouble.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.752
Thanks for the warning.
But we're not the ones in trouble - you are.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.395
Run, Helena!

08:24.720 --> 08:26.358
OK, suck on this.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.235
I think we'd better get out of here.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.954
I haven't scanned anyone
since I was 12 years old.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.554
It was pretty amazing.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.234
I just didn't know I had it in me.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.871
- I knew Alex could do that, but you?
- Just don't tell Father. Please.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.679
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.753
Thanks.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.312
Helena.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.958
Helena?

10:16.360 --> 10:18.510
Darling, are you all right?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.556
I have a headache, Dad.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.039
Oh.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.916
So you were with Joyce.

10:27.640 --> 10:33.112
I just saw her leaving. Hardly recognized her
without her lab coat and clipboard.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.349
Here.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.476
Take one of these, try to relax.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.675
You know I hate those pills.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.638
Well...

10:44.520 --> 10:47.398
I don't want to get your hopes up but...

10:47.480 --> 10:49.789
I have something.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.839
Something which could change your life,
and every other scanner.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.353
That, my darling, is EPH-3,

11:01.440 --> 11:03.431
a new delivery system.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.193
Electronically charged skin patches.

11:06.280 --> 11:10.239
You wear it behind the ear and the drug is
absorbed into the bloodstream.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.311
One patch should last 24 hours.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.188
And you think it'll stop the pain?
And the voices?

11:16.280 --> 11:20.478
I certainly hope so. We've done everything
possible to purify the compound.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.431
When can I try it?

11:24.520 --> 11:26.238
As soon as I've finished testing.

11:26.320 --> 11:30.279
I hope it's soon cos I can't stand those pills
any longer.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.318
They stop the pain, but everything else too.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.631
We don't know,
if any, what the side effects are.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.796
As you know, there's no such thing
as scanner lab rats.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.751
Let me work with you on it. I understand
the problem better than anyone.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.229
I can be your personal control group.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.912
Helena.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.676
We've been through this before.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.116
Who are you going to test it on?

11:58.200 --> 12:02.318
I've found two terminally ill scanners
who will volunteer.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.356
They're at Baumann Clinic.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.789
You're working with Dr. Baumann again?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.230
That pervert.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.471
It's the only clinic for scanners in the region.

12:18.600 --> 12:23.515
I don't want anything to do with EPH-3
if that sadist is going to be involved.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.556
Helena, be reasonable.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.277
I'm sorry, Dad, I just have
so much work to do.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.955
- I'm meeting tomorrow with ASN.
- I know. Get some rest.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.474
Go on. You can catch up in the morning.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.549
Stop!

12:43.640 --> 12:45.949
No, stop, please!

12:46.040 --> 12:51.353
The subject demonstrated pain responses
which require further examination.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.671
Quiet, Helena! It doesn't hurt that much!

12:59.840 --> 13:01.876
No, please don't!

13:05.680 --> 13:07.830
Oww! Stop, please.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.514
No, no, no...

13:11.800 --> 13:13.756
No...

13:22.280 --> 13:25.477
'No, stop!'

15:18.560 --> 15:20.391
Eurgh...

15:24.680 --> 15:27.672
Oh, you stupid creature.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.229
- Well, if it isn't my gorgeous goddaughter.
- Well, if it isn't our expensive attorney.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.199
- How do you feel this morning, Helena?
- Like pure electricity.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.236
Well, that's a change.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.311
Yes, it certainly is.

15:59.400 --> 16:03.279
So I hear you're taking the world by storm
with Mark Dragon.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.669
- They haven't seen anything yet.
- Oh.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.354
Aren't we the confident one these days?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.712
Thanks to Daddy dear.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.237
Have a good day!

16:25.680 --> 16:27.636
What's with her?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.076
I'm not sure. She's been a little...

16:31.160 --> 16:33.674
- flighty lately.
- I see.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.628
So why don't you bring her
into the business?

16:37.720 --> 16:39.756
I'm not convinced she's ready.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.034
Oh, you're right.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.998
It's Alex. I just feel he should have
something to come home to.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.070
I guess when you adopt children
you always are afraid

16:53.160 --> 16:55.958
that your hold on them is a little tenuous.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.237
Elton... you've adopted them both.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.311
I mean, they're both your children

17:02.400 --> 17:06.871
and I think it's time that you faced the fact
that Alex might not be coming back.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.799
So give her a chance.
It could make things easier for both of you.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.836
I've lost Alex, Michael.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.195
I don't want to lose her too.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.713
ASN Broadcasting.

18:26.800 --> 18:31.954
54 TV stations.
Satellite pickup in 15 countries.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.710
Well... here's to
the new kid on the block, Helena.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.836
I'm very flattered, Mr. Dragon.

18:39.440 --> 18:43.797
I didn't know if you realized how much work
I put into the ASN deal.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.273
Not you - me, Mark Dragon.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.555
Takeover king. Your boss.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.590
Oh, come on, Helena. People expect
my employees to do the courting.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.875
And you do it very well.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.756
But when it comes to the wedding,
they want me as the groom.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.400
I am always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.118
It takes time, sweetie.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.678
But if you play your cards right, you'll be fine.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.752
And... what exactly am I doing here,
Mr. Dragon?

19:13.320 --> 19:17.029
You're, um, window dressing.
Know what I mean?

19:20.720 --> 19:22.915
Look who's here.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.470
Mr. First World Bank himself.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.879
You wanna be the big cheese one day?
Watch a master at work.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.031
Mr. Crandall. What a surprise.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.792
Ah.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.518
Mark Dragon.

19:42.120 --> 19:45.112
- Mr. Dudswell and Mr. Bentley.
- Won't you join us?

19:45.200 --> 19:48.909
- No, I'd hate to bust up your evening.
- Oh, not at all.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.956
- We're just celebrating.
- Oh?

19:51.040 --> 19:55.158
- Are you about to make an announcement?
- Yes. But not the kind you mean.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.391
It's business. A little thing
called ASN Broadcasting.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.835
- I just bought it.
- Oh, really?

20:00.920 --> 20:02.956
How do you plan to finance this?

20:03.040 --> 20:06.271
That's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

20:07.520 --> 20:11.035
Helena Monet, VP finance,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.839
Always a pleasure to meet a beautiful lady.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.109
Where was I? Erm... Listen, honey,

20:17.200 --> 20:19.430
go get us some more champagne, babe.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.876
And one more thing, I...

20:24.000 --> 20:25.638
gotta dance!

20:32.280 --> 20:34.111
Look at that guy!

21:23.600 --> 21:26.831
Don't take it personal.
You just fucked with the wrong person.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.199
See ya.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.070
Dr. Baumann.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.718
No one's allowed in here.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.351
Oh, don't worry, Doctor, I'll just take
a moment of your precious time.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.670
Who are you? What do you want?

22:13.640 --> 22:16.598
I guess for you I'm just a distant memory.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.636
But where are your awards?

22:18.720 --> 22:23.077
All those experiments and no recognition
from the psychiatric community.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.718
What a pity.

22:25.280 --> 22:30.115
I thought that your work with that little girl
from Poland was Nobel prize material.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.555
What was her name?

22:32.640 --> 22:34.517
Helena Loey.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.072
That's right.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.958
Dear little Helena.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.634
Dear little Helena, my ass!

22:43.720 --> 22:47.793
You were always a brat. And I can see now
that things haven't changed.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.110
You know it's not polite to point.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.713
Where did you get the idea

22:51.800 --> 22:53.870
- that you could waltz in here...
- I said...

22:53.960 --> 22:56.713
it's not polite to point.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.518
The subject demonstrated pain responses
which could not be verified

23:08.600 --> 23:10.556
without further examination.

23:12.520 --> 23:16.069
- Still a photographer, though, I see.
- I...

23:16.160 --> 23:19.630
I was just trying to help you.
There was no other way.

23:19.720 --> 23:24.271
I guess I should have felt honored
being your favorite lab rat, but I didn't.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.590
I felt like shit!

23:57.760 --> 23:59.478
Now what do you say?

24:01.640 --> 24:02.993
I'm sorry!

24:03.080 --> 24:05.230
No, that's not it.

24:05.960 --> 24:09.077
Look at the camera, Doctor. Come on.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.515
Darn, I hate the way the flash
makes their eyes go red.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.196
Hey, lady. Looking for someone?

24:52.480 --> 24:54.835
Work, work, work.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.196
You're starting to piss me off.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.356
Oh, shit.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.238
That too can be arranged.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.638
Gotta get out of here.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.069
Oh, I hope you're not going to shoot me
with that.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.989
That's better. Now come here.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.193
Yeah, that's it.

25:32.280 --> 25:36.114
Just a little closer so we can
get to know each other better.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.638
Did you ever play doctor
when you were a kid?

25:41.720 --> 25:43.711
Uh-huh.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.870
It was fun, wasn't it?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.996
Do you want to play it now?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.433
OK.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.356
Open your mouth.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.155
And now say, "Aah."

25:56.240 --> 25:57.593
Aaaah!

26:05.640 --> 26:07.392
Next!

26:18.440 --> 26:20.795
You could... You could be...

26:24.400 --> 26:26.595
You could be in big trouble, lady.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.596
It's OK, really.
I worked it all out ahead of time with...

26:30.680 --> 26:33.194
... with Dr. Baumann.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.558
Don't worry, I'm one of you.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.395
An alumni of the hallowed halls
of Baumann Institute.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.711
And guess what. It's graduation day.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.268
You a scanner? Like us?

26:47.960 --> 26:49.951
Not like you, not by a long shot.

26:50.720 --> 26:55.669
You know those skull-crushing headaches
that make you feel like your brain's on fire

26:55.760 --> 27:00.709
and that endless cacophony of voices
that runs on and on and on in your head

27:00.800 --> 27:04.839
until you would gladly claw out
your own eyes with your bare hands

27:04.920 --> 27:09.835
if it will only give you one single second
of blessed silence.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.353
But you know what?

27:11.440 --> 27:13.908
I got it licked. And so can you.

27:28.800 --> 27:33.715
With EPH-3, the latest miracle
of neuropharmacological research.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.030
I had a headache this big

27:36.120 --> 27:38.839
but then I tried EPH-3

27:38.920 --> 27:41.229
and it went away just like that.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.039
So don't delay, get your free samples.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.873
They're free now, while quantities last.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.792
And then maybe, just maybe,

27:56.880 --> 28:00.839
if you're willing to give it your all,
one hundred per cent,

28:00.920 --> 28:03.309
you will not only win your freedom

28:03.400 --> 28:08.155
but the opportunity to stand beside me,
tall and proud,

28:08.240 --> 28:10.435
and say, "We are scanners.

28:10.520 --> 28:15.116
"We do not belong on the bottom
of the dung heap. We belong on the top!"

28:15.960 --> 28:17.598
We're going to go out there

28:17.680 --> 28:24.028
and make those self-righteous normals
squirm like worms on hooks.

28:32.560 --> 28:36.519
There will of course be a small price
for the second installment.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.840
Do any of you remember a patient here

28:40.720 --> 28:43.678
from about 15 years ago
named Alex Malone?

28:43.760 --> 28:44.909
I know him!

29:12.880 --> 29:14.916
You wanted to speak with me, Master?

29:15.000 --> 29:18.356
Yes, Alex. I would like to speak with you.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.793
Come.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.072
Now, tell me,

29:29.160 --> 29:31.958
you have been here a long time,

29:32.040 --> 29:34.395
but why do you continue to stay here?

29:36.520 --> 29:39.557
Because I don't belong in the outside world.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.596
You don't belong here either.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.917
This is not the place
for you to hide from yourself.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.834
- Nor from your past.
- I wanted to go back, Master.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.992
I tried everything but I can't find the answer,

29:54.440 --> 29:56.556
a way to live with myself.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.393
You have special powers.

30:00.520 --> 30:05.913
You must choose whether to treat them
as a curse or a gift.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.792
I killed my best friend
with my special power.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.716
Instead of denying them,

30:24.360 --> 30:26.874
you could do good with your powers.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.235
There is a saying -

30:31.600 --> 30:35.912
That means, "If you receive a boat as a gift,

30:36.920 --> 30:39.593
"do not criticize the hull."

31:03.480 --> 31:05.436
Hello?

31:18.520 --> 31:19.953
Who's there?

31:33.320 --> 31:35.709
Helena? What are you doing?

31:35.800 --> 31:40.157
I thought I'd throw a little party
to thank you for your magnificent gift.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.359
You took EPH-3?

31:44.840 --> 31:47.991
And it works wonderfully, Daddy.
You're a genius.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.036
Are you insane?

31:50.960 --> 31:52.916
Take it off, it's dangerous.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.878
But I've never felt so marvelous.

31:55.960 --> 31:59.350
- You've got to give me more.
- That's out of the question.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.795
Why don't you come in and we'll discuss it?

32:01.880 --> 32:04.314
Come out of there this instant!

32:44.600 --> 32:47.512
Remember when you adopted us?

32:50.800 --> 32:54.839
Two poor little orphans that no one wanted.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.152
We were freaks.

33:03.400 --> 33:08.474
You told us you wanted a little boy
to succeed you,

33:09.840 --> 33:13.276
and a little girl of your very own.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.276
But you didn't say what for.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.430
That's why you didn't want me to work.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.719
You wanted me all for yourself.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.358
It's the drug!

33:34.440 --> 33:37.079
- Take it off!
- All that pain,

33:37.160 --> 33:39.116
and all this time...

33:40.280 --> 33:42.589
you've had the answer.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.636
Take it off!

34:16.840 --> 34:18.909
Nothing personal, Daddy,

34:19.000 --> 34:23.551
but with you around,
I'd never get control of your company.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.030
Oh, Michael.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.588
I got here as fast as I could.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.476
What happened?

34:54.080 --> 34:56.036
They say it was a heart attack.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.869
Michael, I just saw him floating out there
and I tried to help him but...

35:01.960 --> 35:03.916
I was too late.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.198
What was he doing in the hot tub
at this hour? He hated that hot tub.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.316
Michael, he's dead.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.436
Mike, Dad's dead.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.716
Of course I'll make
all the arrangements.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.189
At least his will is in order.

35:45.280 --> 35:50.035
As you know, I'm the executor,
so I can go over it with you in detail.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.953
In a few days. There's no rush, don't worry.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.711
And of course I'll have to contact Alex.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.997
He has to make several decisions
about the company.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.672
I don't think he can.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.513
- Father tried to find him for a year.
- Yes.

36:07.880 --> 36:12.112
Perhaps that's why Alex didn't want
to be found, not by his father at least.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.670
- Michael, you...
- Don't get your hopes up. We'll see.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.516
I've gotta make some calls.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.916
And don't worry, please.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.036
I'm taking care of everything.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.232
Alex, hmm...

36:42.120 --> 36:43.792
my dear...

36:44.640 --> 36:47.029
beloved brother.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.198
Your passport is due to expire
in less than a week.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.714
I'm only gonna be here a couple of days.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.597
Sorry, you cannot enter Thailand

37:31.680 --> 37:36.310
without a passport valid for at least
six months after the day that you arrive.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.828
Oh. Of course.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.195
We'll make an exception in your case.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.472
Enjoy your stay, sir.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.398
Thank you.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.639
Welcome to Thailand.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.950
Yeah, right.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.316
My master says...

38:26.400 --> 38:28.356
we must accept death as karma.

38:31.360 --> 38:34.830
But there's a long way
between theory and practice.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.233
I cannot accept Father's death, Michael.

39:00.680 --> 39:04.992
Been hard on all of us. You should
come back, it's been over a year.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.435
No one blames you for what happened.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.552
I never understood. Even if I hadn't...

40:04.320 --> 40:08.791
Even if things hadn't turned out this way,
I still wouldn't have gone back.

40:09.960 --> 40:13.589
Well, he was obsessed with having
an heir to the family business.

40:13.680 --> 40:18.435
- I wish it had been Helena.
- It might be if you don't come back.

40:18.520 --> 40:23.275
Don't get me wrong but there's something
strange about your father's death.

40:27.360 --> 40:31.319
Alex, I didn't come here just to tell you
about your father.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.273
It's Helena.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.316
Something's happened to her.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.356
Yes, I'm certain.
I saw the patch on her neck.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.396
Why would she do that, Mike?

41:10.320 --> 41:12.117
She was never the impulsive type.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.954
She's changed, Alex. Not for the better.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.996
What do you mean?

41:18.480 --> 41:23.270
I can't put my finger on it, but it was as if she
resented the way your father treated her.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.512
Alex!

42:29.600 --> 42:31.955
It's a long way from Baumann's clinic, huh?

43:32.880 --> 43:37.158
My brother Alex is dead.

43:38.480 --> 43:42.075
As you can imagine, the second blow
has affected me deeply.

43:42.160 --> 43:47.234
However, because both my father
and my brother are now gone,

43:47.320 --> 43:49.276
I have, through these tragic accidents,

43:49.360 --> 43:53.148
been left in the position
of being my father's sole heir.

43:54.320 --> 43:57.357
And after a great deal of soul searching,

43:57.440 --> 43:59.590
I have decided to succeed him

44:00.800 --> 44:04.998
as chairman and CEO
of Monet Pharmaceutical.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.869
Well, we... we all share your grief,
Miss Monet.

44:15.640 --> 44:17.471
And I believe that I can safely say

44:17.560 --> 44:22.156
that we appreciate your desire to continue
your father's work.

44:22.960 --> 44:27.829
However, a decision of this nature
must be brought to a vote.

44:27.920 --> 44:30.309
I presume you have a candidate in mind.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.631
Yes. I would like to nominate...

44:39.960 --> 44:42.030
Ugh...

44:42.120 --> 44:44.429
Miss Helena Monet.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.798
My father was a brilliant scientist.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.836
He was a great humanitarian.

45:03.520 --> 45:07.638
But, as many of you no doubt realize,
he was not an aggressive businessman.

45:07.720 --> 45:12.953
He was content to simply maintain
corporate stature of Monet Pharmaceutical.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.837
However...

45:14.920 --> 45:17.229
I am not.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.117
So here is the game plan.

45:19.200 --> 45:20.952
First...

45:21.040 --> 45:25.158
annihilation of MPI's competitors
in the pharmaceutical field. Second...

45:25.240 --> 45:29.119
strategic diversification and expansion
into new areas. Third...

45:29.200 --> 45:32.829
total domination of all new markets
and territories.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.993
Things have changed around here, guys,
and it's gonna be a bumpy ride,

45:40.080 --> 45:42.435
so if you want to bail out, bail out now.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.756
'Alex.'

46:45.440 --> 46:48.398
'I know you are traumatized

46:48.480 --> 46:51.040
'but there is evil in this world

46:51.120 --> 46:54.317
'that not even a stoic can ignore,

46:54.400 --> 46:59.793
'and we must face the conflict
between such evil

47:00.480 --> 47:02.994
'and its opposite, good.

47:04.600 --> 47:11.392
'We must have criteria for deciding
what in any situation is good,

47:11.480 --> 47:13.789
'what is evil.

47:14.560 --> 47:18.189
'You will find the fulcrum in your heart.

47:19.480 --> 47:22.790
'Now go deep inside yourself.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.994
'Use the long breath method.'

47:33.360 --> 47:36.875
'Now that you can control your breath,

47:37.720 --> 47:41.474
'you learn to control your heart.'

48:15.400 --> 48:17.277
Hi. How are you?

48:17.360 --> 48:18.918
Fine.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.592
Listen, Joyce, uh...

48:20.680 --> 48:22.636
I have a question.

48:26.320 --> 48:30.279
Before Father's heart attack, he was
working on a new formula, EPH-3.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.794
- You know about it?
- Mm-hm, a little.

48:32.880 --> 48:37.192
- Because I want to go into production.
- Helena, that's impossible.

48:37.280 --> 48:41.114
Your father was making progress
but it was still experimental.

48:41.200 --> 48:44.875
That's OK, Joyce. I tried it myself.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.837
Helena, how could you do that?

48:46.920 --> 48:49.229
Anything could have happened to you.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.834
I know, I know, but it works, Joyce.

48:51.920 --> 48:57.631
It works beautifully. No negative side effects,
just a complete release from pain.

48:57.720 --> 49:02.077
The problem is Dad only left a small supply
and I need more to keep going.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.277
Especially if I'm going to run this company.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.113
I can't do that, I don't have the formula.

49:08.200 --> 49:10.839
Here. You have to do top to bottom analysis

49:10.920 --> 49:14.993
and I want you to put it
into full-scale production immediately.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.516
This is what Dad wanted.

49:19.600 --> 49:23.513
It was his dream to make scanners' lives
bearable, to cure their pain.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.556
We cannot let it be destroyed.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.036
It's gonna take some time.

49:29.640 --> 49:32.393
I'm so glad I have at least one friend here.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.311
Thank you, Joyce.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.676
You wanted to see me, Miss Monet?

49:42.760 --> 49:45.354
- Yes. George, isn't it?
- Yes, Miss Monet.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.192
Have a seat.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.312
- I liked your presentation to the board.
- Thank you.

49:52.400 --> 49:55.437
I want you to be my personal assistant.
Any problems?

49:55.520 --> 49:57.238
- No, I'd be...
- Good.

49:57.320 --> 50:00.949
I want all of the company's financial records,
an earnings report,

50:01.040 --> 50:05.113
a list of our assets, particularly liquid
assets. I want it complete, and...

50:05.200 --> 50:07.156
I want it in an hour. Got that?

50:07.240 --> 50:09.117
Yes, Miss Monet.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.918
One more thing.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.434
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.192
Ditch her.

50:15.280 --> 50:20.354
You are going to be a very busy boy.

50:24.560 --> 50:26.869
'You must be just so very excited.

50:26.960 --> 50:30.873
'You've got a new rock video,
a new hairdo, I see.

50:30.960 --> 50:33.952
'And, if my researchers haven't
screwed up again,

50:34.040 --> 50:35.712
'a new man in your life.'

50:35.800 --> 50:38.553
- 'Whoa, the new man in my life...'
- 'Tell us.'

50:38.640 --> 50:42.349
Come on, Georgie boy,
use your imagination.

50:42.440 --> 50:45.830
'Well, the video's coming out next week...'

50:45.920 --> 50:47.876
Oh, yes.

50:47.960 --> 50:50.428
That's much better.

50:51.680 --> 50:54.638
'Oh, yes. That's much better.'

50:54.720 --> 50:57.029
You're making me tingle all over.

50:57.600 --> 51:00.194
'You're making me tingle all over.'

51:03.600 --> 51:05.397
I didn't say that, did I?

51:07.120 --> 51:10.271
'Better watch it, we're on live television!'

51:10.360 --> 51:14.069
I need you so bad. I need you now.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.912
'I need you so bad.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.956
'I need you now.'

51:19.480 --> 51:21.550
Let's make it with the naked nasty.

51:21.640 --> 51:24.074
'Ooh, yeah.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.879
'Let's make it with the naked nasty.'

51:33.360 --> 51:36.989
'Please stand by. We are experiencing
technical difficulties.'

51:37.080 --> 51:41.949
I hope you're not experiencing
any technical difficulties, George.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.235
No, no, no, no. Just watch the TV, OK?

52:18.800 --> 52:20.358
It works.

52:21.960 --> 52:24.872
I've got a feeling
we'll be going network on this.

52:26.160 --> 52:30.039
What's happening to the ASN stock?
You're supposed to be in charge of it.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.236
Well, how the hell did it happen?

52:33.840 --> 52:36.957
Well, tell him to stop selling, jerk-off!

52:37.040 --> 52:41.033
I am the goddamn takeover king.
Nobody does this to me.

52:41.120 --> 52:44.476
Find out who the hell's behind it
and find out now.

52:46.840 --> 52:48.478
Jesus!

52:48.560 --> 52:50.710
Helena. Who the hell let you in here?

52:50.800 --> 52:54.236
Is that the way to greet
your favorite girl Friday?

52:54.320 --> 52:57.437
What did you do? Slip a Mickey in my drink?

52:57.520 --> 53:00.671
I actually slipped a Mickey...

53:00.760 --> 53:02.512
into your life.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.869
By the way, how am I doing?

53:05.960 --> 53:08.918
You... You're behind this?

53:13.000 --> 53:14.831
Let me tell you something.

53:14.920 --> 53:16.717
You don't have a hope in hell

53:16.800 --> 53:20.679
because I am gonna rip off your balls
and shove 'em down your throat.

53:20.760 --> 53:22.352
Ooh!

53:22.440 --> 53:25.591
- I don't have any balls, Mark.
- Goddamn right.

53:25.680 --> 53:28.399
But by the look of things I do have ASN.

53:28.480 --> 53:32.712
What was it again, 15 stations
in 54 countries or the other way round?

53:32.800 --> 53:35.155
Over my dead body.

53:35.240 --> 53:38.232
I knew you had a knack for business, Mark,

53:38.320 --> 53:40.038
but wow,

53:40.120 --> 53:41.678
that's brilliant.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.513
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

53:46.680 --> 53:48.272
I mean...

53:48.360 --> 53:52.592
how about a nice, cool dip in the old pool?

53:52.680 --> 53:54.671
What, are you nuts? It's freez...

53:58.400 --> 53:59.992
Now that you mention it...

54:01.560 --> 54:04.279
...um... It's not such a bad idea.

54:07.720 --> 54:12.669
Mark, Mark, Mark, this exhibitionist thing.
I start to worry about you.

54:14.120 --> 54:17.556
Mmm, excellent form, Mark,

54:20.760 --> 54:23.274
I must say, you do have balls.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.310
Now hang on to them.

54:52.400 --> 54:54.356
'Now that I think of it,

54:54.440 --> 54:57.830
'it was 54 stations, 15 countries.'

54:57.920 --> 55:00.753
'Exactly what I need for my next takeover.'

55:28.960 --> 55:30.518
Helena?

57:11.680 --> 57:14.752
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm here to see Helena Monet.

57:14.840 --> 57:16.796
- I'm her brother Alex.
- Just a moment.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.875
Miss Monet's brother is here to see her.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.469
- They'll just be a moment.
- Thank you.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.553
Alex.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.156
You haven't changed.

57:52.440 --> 57:54.271
You heard...

57:56.280 --> 57:58.236
Yeah, I've heard.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.470
- Michael told me.
- Michael?

58:04.520 --> 58:06.476
When did you talk to him?

58:10.440 --> 58:12.112
He's dead.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.872
Oh, my God.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.311
Not Michael.

58:18.680 --> 58:20.272
What happened?

58:22.800 --> 58:25.155
I've been over in Thailand, Helena.

58:26.280 --> 58:28.999
Michael came to tell me about Dad.

58:32.440 --> 58:34.874
He was attacked, no reason.

58:34.960 --> 58:38.236
There was a scanner there
that I think was responsible.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.311
Scanner?

58:40.400 --> 58:43.597
- Something must have set him off.
- It wasn't like that.

58:45.040 --> 58:47.679
It was deliberate, cold-blooded murder.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.156
Why would anyone want to kill Michael?

58:53.400 --> 58:57.837
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me.
I've been in a monastery for two years.

58:57.920 --> 59:00.434
Suddenly Dad's dead, Michael's dead,

59:02.040 --> 59:03.996
and you've taken over here.

59:06.560 --> 59:09.154
And what's with the scan signal

59:09.240 --> 59:12.277
- on the video, Helena?
- Oh, that.

59:12.360 --> 59:15.636
- I was just playing around, Alex.
- Burning cigars?

59:17.160 --> 59:20.516
Michael was concerned,
said you were taking a new drug.

59:20.600 --> 59:24.354
'Miss Monet, your car's downstairs.'

59:26.800 --> 59:28.916
Thank you, George, I'm on my way.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.754
I'm sorry, I have a meeting
with our Japanese affiliates.

59:38.840 --> 59:42.310
Look, er... there is a drug, it's true.

59:43.240 --> 59:45.037
EPH-3.

59:45.120 --> 59:47.475
Dad invented it. It's for scanners.

59:48.280 --> 59:50.555
Completely relieving their pain.

59:50.640 --> 59:54.428
But I don't know what Michael was
talking about. It's a miracle drug.

59:54.520 --> 59:56.715
Ask Joyce if you don't believe me.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.230
Joyce is involved?

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.359
Yeah, she's up at Baumann. They're doing
wonderful things for scanners.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.396
The place has changed so much.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.914
Go and see for yourself.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.275
I think Joyce would love to see you.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.430
Dr. Baumann is unavailable.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.715
May I take a message?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.439
Uh-huh, yes. Thank you.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.633
I can help you.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.233
Hi.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.392
I'm looking for Joyce Stone.
Tell her it's Alex Monet.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.436
Of course, sir.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.516
If you'll just follow me.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.032
I think you'll find what you're looking for...

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.076
right in here.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.789
Ah...

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.915
Uh... Miss...

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.752
- Suzy.
- Suzy.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.276
Suzy, look, I don't think this is a good idea.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.112
See, I, er...

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.876
I live in a monastery.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.599
Well, this'll give you
something to think about

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.910
when you lay in bed.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.194
Alone in the dark.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.633
Doing...

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.110
whatever it is you do.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.151
- Where's Dr. Stone?
- She's been detained.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.836
But I'm here to take care of your every need.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.393
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.392
They're not real.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.798
Well, well, well, well,
well, well, well, well, well.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.598
What do we have here?

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.955
Boys, I think we've got us a rapist.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.271
Oh, come on, Mitch, he was willing.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.640
Not you, nimbo-bimbo.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.631
- Him.
- Me?

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.110
- Hmm.
- What the hell's going on around here?

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.279
- And what?
- Well, let me explain.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.069
This is the breakdown of the analysis
of the EPH-3 prototype.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.596
Paraoxon hydrochloride, cyanocabalamin,
cupric oxide.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.114
- I know that. And so?
- So nothing.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.909
It's inert. You might as well
be taking vitamin pills, Helena.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.991
You must have missed something.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.959
We're running it through again
but I don't think so.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.554
If there's anything I can do to help...

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.914
I know. I know.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.073
I'll look through Dad's video tape.
See if I can find something there.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.072
- Wake up now.
- Guard the door.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.516
We're taking a little stroll
down memory lane.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.315
Oh, come on, come on.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.676
A taste of Baumann's laser therapy to
teach a guy to keep his hands off the staff.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.317
Wake up, Romeo.
We wanna show you our new toy.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.790
Quick, get around the back door.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.951
Get in the bus!

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.392
Come on, come on,
the creep's getting away.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.953
Faster! Faster!

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.996
I think I got him.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.911
Can you swim?

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.755
Better safe than sorry. Go check.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.317
Alex?

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.633
Jesus.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.836
What's happened to you?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.312
I'm, uh... not sure you're gonna believe it.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.999
I'm still not sure I do.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.993
What is it?

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.478
I, uh...

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.996
I had to kill a man today.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.836
I just got back this morning.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.872
I wanted to see you
so I went out to Baumann.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.518
Baumann? Why?

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.558
Cos Helena told me that you would be there.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.872
But it was a trap.
She sent me out there deliberately.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:44.555
A group of scanners attacked me.
- That's impossible.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.278
She's your sister.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.836
She's my best friend.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.676
She's changed.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.957
Listen.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.593
Can you tell me anything
about this new drug she's taking?

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.353
EPH-3? Your dad developed it.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:15.069
Are you sure there's no side effects
to that drug?

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.116
I never saw the test results.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.473
Helena said it herself. I believed her when
she told me there were no side effects.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.676
But maybe there are.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.511
The way she's been acting.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.716
I think it's somehow blocked out
her conscience.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.429
And with scanners, Joyce,
that can be a dangerous thing.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:44.194
It's hard to explain but when a...

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.236
when a scanner loses control,

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.513
there are these forces,
strange feelings inside,

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.113
it's... it's almost like a rage.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.597
It just builds and builds and builds

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.636
and builds inside you.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.592
Is there, Alex?

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.635
Is that what you were afraid of?

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.755
Is that why you ran away?

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.677
'Exterior application
is necessitated.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.518
'Now I have with me a rough prototype
skin patch which...

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.431
'Oh, shit.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.355
' Pardon me for using
such highly technical language!'

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.436
'... which... Oh, shit.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.355
' Pardon me for using
such highly technical language!'

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.318
'Uh, this is continuation of lab report
October... 17th 1990...'

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.313
Daddy... what have I done?

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.393
'In order to, uh... isolate...'

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.791
'... most important EPH-3,

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.917
'or as we call it "eff"-3,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.309
'remains inactive

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.233
'until the electronic sensor is triggered

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:53.075
'by trace molecular elements found only
in scanner subjects.'

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.553
Bingo.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.870
'Now I'm going to turn this off.'

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.518
- Alex?
- Mm-hm?

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.789
I've been thinking about
what you said about Helena.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.910
- Mmm...
- Is that what you've been thinking about?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.956
Seriously!

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.308
I'm gonna go down to the office
and see what I can find out.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.718
Mmm...

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.116
Are you listening to me?

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.720
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.233
Hi there.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.434
Go! He's going around the other side!

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.950
I hate this bloody city.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.198
I really hate this city.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.870
Interesting reading?

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:50.512
It's nice to see my employees in
bright and early snooping through my office.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.556
Speaking of eager beavers,

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.030
I hear you and Alex had
a very tender evening in.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:02.910
- Helena, what have you done?
- You're such an innocent, such a prude.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.792
I'll tell you what I've done,
I've come into my own.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.714
I've finally gotten the power
I've always deserved.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.593
By the way, while you were
making whoopee,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.150
I was making history.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.230
Yep. I cracked the code, Joyce.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.031
Seems like poor old Dad
just forgot to mention

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.315
that the missing element

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.834
is only to be found

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.876
in bodily secretions...

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:38.151
of the scanners' metabolic type.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.071
Helena...

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.832
please, listen to me.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.832
You've got to stop taking the drug.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.629
The psychological side effects
could be devastating.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.950
- You think so?
- Yes.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.156
This isn't you, Helena, you're not normal.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.472
You can say that again.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.516
You're n-not normal.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.397
That's better.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.873
I wanted to get you between the sheets...

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.640
but this is ridiculous!

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.592
Oh, well.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.356
Easy come, easy go.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.799
Oops!

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.791
Good night, sweet prince.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.630
- Who are you?
- I'm, er...

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.073
temporary.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.515
Huh. Not too temporary...

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.556
I hope.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.672
Uh, say...

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.274
after I've finished with my rounds...

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.669
I can't wait.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.111
Neither can I.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.758
'Now that you can
control your breath...'

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.637
Bye.

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:20.113
'... you learn to control your heart.'

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.710
Jesus! We've got a code blue! Move it!

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.995
Don't just stand there. Prep him!

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.557
- Nothing.
- Let's try and jump-start the poor bastard.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.513
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.318
Nothing.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.356
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:50.030
Ah, there's nothing, Doctor.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.758
Mark the time and take him down
for an autopsy.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.916
Mind if I use your phone?

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.549
Is it... is it a-a-a... a local call?

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.237
I've got total control over
Worldwide Satellite Network

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.550
and EPH-3 in full production.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.518
Now let's go on the air
and take over the world.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.751
Scanners are in control,
thanks to you, Joyce.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.435
- My job was simple.
- By the way, how are you feeling?

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.715
I have never felt better, Helena.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.439
That's good, because it's show time.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.155
Come on, Joyce, answer the phone.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.633
'He's fading back long,
and there's the pass.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:20.157
'Oh, look at that!
He's cut down on the 45 yard line.'

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.834
Joyce Stone, I need to see her.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.952
Now!

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:32.149
- I don't know where she is.
- Where did she take her?

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.550
- I don't know.
- 'Enjoy the game, Miss Monet.'

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:40.714
'The Unstoppable Force, this year's
highest points per game average,

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.189
'go head to head with Immovable Objects.

'And ASN is bringing all of the excitement
and action to an additional 25 countries.

'And now back to you, Jim.'

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.511
'Right, Miss Monet.
It's two and ten on the 45

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.195
'and there's the snap back... Ohhh!'

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:05.594
'And, Jim, I think I can guarantee
that our estimated 75 million viewers

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.989
'have a big thrill in store, right?'

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.640
'Right, Miss Monet.
Back to the playing field.'

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.712
'Third down with ten to go,

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.075
'and there's the snap.

'He's fading back for the pass.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.111
'Oh, and he's going for it!

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.919
'Up to the 30! He could go all the way!'

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.156
'Like I said, Jim.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.071
'A violent game.'

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.313
- Hey, man, what's going on?
- I don't know.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.510
'There goes a doctor.'

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.032
'First, let's take another look
with ASN's iso-cam.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.076
'Wow! Talk about special effects!'

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.877
'You will obey without hesitation

'my every command.'

'Resistance is impossible.

'and we are in control.

Come on, Joyce, I gotta get you out of here.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.994
That wouldn't be a very good idea, Alex.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.870
Wouldn't want you to ruin everything
we've been working so hard for.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.958
Get him!

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.193
Look, Joyce, I gotta go back.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.669
Excuse me but nobody leaves
until after intermission!

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:52.151
So get your popcorn, back to your seats,
and get ready for act two.

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.755
You ready for the second act?

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.432
I'll give you the second act.

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.078
Helena!

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.311
You meddlesome little twerp.

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.589
'Sweet, sweet revenge.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.756
'A dish best served cold.'

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.794
But some like it hot.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.872
And it's gonna get a hell of a lot hotter
before I'm through.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.476
Give it a rest, Helena.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.351
You always wanted to hog my glory,
didn't you?

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.318
I never wanted your glory, Helena.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.959
I never did.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.156
Liar!

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.435
You pathetic weakling.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.998
Alex!

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.996
I didn't have any choice.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.237
I had no choice, Joyce!

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.068
I had no choice, Joyce!

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.595
Argh!

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.199
No, Helena!
