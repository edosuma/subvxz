00:54.026 --> 00:56.236
Dude wake up, c'mon.

00:57.536 --> 00:59.006
It's time for work.

01:01.676 --> 01:02.636
Lame!

01:03.016 --> 01:05.936
Dude c'mon, let's go watch that karaoke tape from last night!

01:06.056 --> 01:06.946
What tape?

01:07.086 --> 01:09.386
Dude the tape from last night, remember?

01:09.386 --> 01:14.176
That old dude with the ponytail gave us a copy of our killer performance.

01:14.496 --> 01:15.766
Oh yeah.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.436
Dude we were awesome last night.

01:17.436 --> 01:18.796
Totally awesome!

01:18.796 --> 01:19.756
Where'd you put it?

01:19.846 --> 01:20.726
Put what?

01:20.886 --> 01:22.806
- The tape. - Oh yeah.

01:22.936 --> 01:25.976
- I put in the fridge. - Oh yeah.

01:25.976 --> 01:29.226
To keep the tape as cool as were last night.

01:37.126 --> 01:38.246
So cool.

01:45.176 --> 01:48.176
Give it up for Rigby and Mordecai!

01:48.956 --> 01:49.786
Dude!

01:51.766 --> 01:53.116
- Hurry up hurry up. - Alright.

01:53.116 --> 01:55.206
- Hello hello hello! - Dude c'mon!

03:17.456 --> 03:18.906
What the heck are we doing!

03:19.116 --> 03:20.546
My name's Skips,

03:20.546 --> 03:23.506
let me and my muscles stare at you condescendingly.

03:23.506 --> 03:26.546
Walking? No, thanks. I'm too good for that.

03:26.996 --> 03:29.426
- Do you remember any of this? - No, no!

03:35.336 --> 03:36.946
Wait stop, stop!

03:37.036 --> 03:39.706
What do you think, folks? Do you like these guys?

03:42.116 --> 03:46.276
Hey, you boys don't mind if I play this video at my club as a promo, do you?

03:46.276 --> 03:47.746
Nah, whatever dude.

03:47.746 --> 03:52.196
You gotta give us a copy though so we can re-live this night forever!

03:55.176 --> 03:58.486
- Dude, we can't let anybody see this. - See what?

04:00.336 --> 04:01.326
See this!

04:03.076 --> 04:04.596
Pfft, I've seen that before.

04:04.596 --> 04:07.746
You're not the only one scared of technology.

04:07.846 --> 04:08.986
What's this?

04:09.276 --> 04:11.876
Carrey O' Key's Karaoke?

04:11.876 --> 04:13.786
Did you say karaoke?

04:13.786 --> 04:16.486
Oh, I just love karaoke!

04:16.486 --> 04:19.606
Oh, we must go Benson, we must!

04:19.606 --> 04:21.656
Yeah, that would be pretty fun!

04:21.656 --> 04:23.016
- Alright. - What!?

04:23.016 --> 04:25.916
Well I have been working you all pretty hard lately,

04:25.916 --> 04:28.866
so how 'bout we all go out tonight and karaoke it up,

04:28.866 --> 04:29.726
my treat?

04:31.976 --> 04:33.276
Great idea guys.

04:33.476 --> 04:35.966
Alright, let's finish our work for the day, fellas.

04:35.966 --> 04:37.966
This is gonna be awesome!

04:37.966 --> 04:41.146
Ooh, I can feel the excitement in my bladder!

04:41.656 --> 04:43.566
Man, we're totally dead.

04:43.696 --> 04:46.226
Dead? Dude, they're gonna hate us forever!

04:46.226 --> 04:48.586
Awww, why are we so dumb?

04:48.616 --> 04:50.116
It was the music, man!

04:50.116 --> 04:52.716
It fueled our frustrations, it wasn't our fault!

04:52.716 --> 04:55.126
Whatever, we just can't let them see us trashing them.

04:55.126 --> 04:57.206
We gotta go find that master tape.

04:57.206 --> 04:58.586
But how are we gonna do that?

04:58.586 --> 04:59.856
Dude, it'll be easy.

04:59.856 --> 05:01.656
We'll just go ask that fat dude for the tape,

05:01.656 --> 05:04.016
and if he says no, we'll just take it from him.

05:05.866 --> 05:07.106
I said no!

05:07.106 --> 05:10.066
I can play that tape whenever I feel like it

05:10.066 --> 05:12.596
and there's not a darn thin you can do about it.

05:12.596 --> 05:15.206
I don't wanna see you punks back here again.

05:15.206 --> 05:16.406
You're banned!

05:20.396 --> 05:21.956
Benson! Hey man,

05:22.026 --> 05:23.476
we need to talk to you about tonight.

05:23.476 --> 05:25.326
I'm only paying for the songs.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.516
You're on your own for food and drinks.

05:27.756 --> 05:29.216
Aww what?

05:29.216 --> 05:32.186
Well, I've always got my gravy pouch.

05:36.746 --> 05:38.166
No, Benson, wait!

05:38.166 --> 05:40.856
We don't think going to karaoke tonight is such a good idea.

05:40.856 --> 05:42.906
- What? - Karaoke's lame.

05:42.906 --> 05:45.456
We should do something really fun, like bowling!

05:45.456 --> 05:46.776
Yeah, bowling's good!

05:46.776 --> 05:48.926
Or pool, the pool hall's always fun.

05:48.926 --> 05:50.076
Rack 'em up!

05:50.076 --> 05:51.186
Guys, please.

05:51.186 --> 05:53.676
If we're throwing out halls, why not the greatest hall of them all?

05:53.676 --> 05:54.776
- Dance hall. - Bingo!

05:54.776 --> 05:56.366
- Oh bingo? Really? - Guys.

05:56.366 --> 05:59.316
No no no, dance hall, I was saying bingo like you got it!

05:59.316 --> 06:00.406
Bingo halls are for losers.

06:00.406 --> 06:02.476
Guys! What is it with you two?

06:02.476 --> 06:06.146
I'm trying to do something nice for everyone, boost morale around here.

06:06.146 --> 06:09.916
Besides, I've already called the karaoke place and reserved a table.

06:09.916 --> 06:12.706
- But wait, can't we just- - No, we're going to karaoke,

06:12.706 --> 06:15.046
and you know what, now it's mandatory.

06:15.046 --> 06:17.816
Yup, mandatory having fun at karaoke night.

06:17.816 --> 06:21.166
You don't come and you're fired. So deal with it!

06:21.746 --> 06:22.746
Now what.

06:26.396 --> 06:30.616
Ooh, look how many songs. I'm gonna sing them all!

06:30.616 --> 06:32.066
No Pops, just one.

06:32.106 --> 06:33.656
Skips, what're you gonna sing?

06:33.656 --> 06:36.326
Do they have anything with Spanish guitar?

06:37.166 --> 06:39.526
Skips bringing it old school!

06:41.186 --> 06:42.706
Where's Mordecai and Rigby?

06:42.926 --> 06:44.716
Uh, ready to order sir?

06:44.716 --> 06:46.446
No, we're still waiting for two.

06:46.586 --> 06:48.986
They don't think I was serious about this being mandatory

06:48.986 --> 06:50.276
I was being serious.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.006
If they don't show up they're fired.

06:52.006 --> 06:53.896
Ooh, they'll be here!

06:57.326 --> 06:58.376
Oh man,

06:58.476 --> 07:00.966
dude, we gotta hurry this up, Benson's gonna blow a fuse!

07:00.966 --> 07:01.706
Rigby!

07:03.846 --> 07:05.026
Hey, I found it.

07:05.206 --> 07:08.456
Hey Carl, how many signed up for karaoke so far?

07:08.456 --> 07:09.666
Just one, boss.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.516
Well dangit that's not enough!

07:11.516 --> 07:14.406
We can't keep this place going with just one singer a night!

07:14.406 --> 07:16.516
It's time to play that dang tape!

07:16.516 --> 07:18.796
If that won't get people singing nothing will.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.796
Now get me ready like we talked about,

07:20.796 --> 07:22.526
