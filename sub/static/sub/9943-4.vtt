00:01.200 --> 00:05.199
Now nobody's saying the Chatsworth
Estate is the Garden of Eden,

00:06.440 --> 00:08.359
but it's been a good home to us.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.759
To me, Frank Gallagher
and me kids, who I'm proud of,

00:11.760 --> 00:15.759
cos every single one of them
reminds me a little of me.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.919
They can all think for themselves,
which they've me to thank for.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.919
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite,
which is why nobody
calls him Philip any more.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.199
Ian, a lot like his mam,
which was handy for the others
when she disappeared into thin air.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.239
And Carl, daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.679
One, it stand on end
and makes him look like Toyah.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.199
Two, nits love it.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.039
Debbie. Sent by God. Total Angel.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.039
You've to check your change,
but she'll go miles out of
her way to do you a favour.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.399
Plus lickle Liam.
He's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.399
Monica, the wife.
She's back, with her bird in tow.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.959
And we can't get shot of her.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.999
And the neighbours.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.879
The neighbours.
Well, what can you say?

01:01.880 --> 01:05.719
Nothing if you don't want your arms
breaking. Still, nobody's perfect.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.519
But, all of them, to a man,
know first and foremost one of

01:09.520 --> 01:13.519
the most vital necessities is...
They know how to throw a party!

01:15.760 --> 01:19.399
www.addic7ed.com

01:19.400 --> 01:20.439
Gonna make some toast..

01:20.440 --> 01:21.559
'Cock.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.119
'Cock, cock, cock, cock, cock.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.919
'When I'm not looking for it,
I'm looking at it.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.639
'I'm thinking about it.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.199
'Women reckon we're in control of it.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.119
'Blame blokes when they
land straight hard-ons.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.319
'Like we know what it's gonna do.'

01:37.320 --> 01:38.399
Liam!

01:38.400 --> 01:41.719
'My mate's cat was settling for
a sleep on me the other day.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.279
'I was like the Hilton fucking Tower.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.199
'And I don't want sex with a cat.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.199
'I don't.'

01:59.760 --> 02:03.679
Mandy!

02:03.680 --> 02:04.799
I've just been sacked.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.839
Ian!

02:05.840 --> 02:07.879
It says they can't
afford to pay me any more.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.399
I heard the chip shop were looking.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.239
Is now the best time
to discuss this?

02:11.240 --> 02:12.559
It's a shit job.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.919
But they can't just sack
me like it means nothing.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.959
Right, this is about Kash.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.119
No.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.399
You're not still
shagging him, are you?

02:19.400 --> 02:20.479
Speaking of which.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.959
He did it by fucking letter.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.959
Your family.
It's like a zoo in here.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.919
You can't do this to me.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.919
Look, Ian.
If there was any other way.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.919
You said whatever happened, you'd
always want me working here.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.359
This isn't about us
and I know what I said previously.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.839
This is about now. Business.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.719
Kash, you're talking to me.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.119
It's just business, OK?

03:01.120 --> 03:03.839
Business.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.839
My arse it is.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.919
Oi!

03:36.720 --> 03:40.119
What the fuck are you doin'?
You trashed my bike!

03:40.120 --> 03:43.559
They're gonna kill me,
if they catch me.

03:43.560 --> 03:47.439
What have you done?

03:47.440 --> 03:49.919
I'm not really into
trust games but...help us.

03:49.920 --> 03:50.919
Why?

03:50.920 --> 03:53.839
Because you're 'ere
and you've got a kind face.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.839
And if you don't, I'm
gonna get shot with shite.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.879
Look, I dunno.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.479
Fuck the kind face, then.

04:01.480 --> 04:05.479
Save us for a wedge.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.759
Kash is at mosque or Council
while his beautiful wife
sits at home doin' her nails?

04:13.400 --> 04:15.199
When do I have time for
fucking nails?

04:15.200 --> 04:17.319
I'm not a fan of beauty treatments.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.918
I like natural.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.399
Stop looking at me arse.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.759
When were last time he did a
full day in his shop? Never.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.559
Cos he has too much fun at his
Council...All right, Kash?

04:27.560 --> 04:30.599
Trying to shag my wife again,
you can fuck off.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.879
Ian's not turned up so
I'm left to do everything!

04:32.880 --> 04:34.079
Unless you're gonna
stay and help me.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.919
Sorry, busy.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.279
Big day with the Council. >

04:38.280 --> 04:41.199
Another thing. Red reminder -
you've not paid the phone bill!

04:41.200 --> 04:42.679
I said, I'll sort it.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.839
Kash!

04:44.840 --> 04:47.519
When you get angry, your lip curls.
It's kinda sexy.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.519
Do as the man says and fuck off!

04:55.080 --> 04:57.719
No! Oh!

04:57.720 --> 05:00.159
(ON PHONE) 'Mimi? Hello?'

05:03.440 --> 05:05.719
Mimi?

05:05.720 --> 05:09.719
Mimi, love?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.839
Jesus Christ.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.079
You gave me the fright of my life.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.639
Kenny. Dead.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.319
What, your brother Kenny?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.399
30,000 volts in
his birthday barbecue.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.359
Well, you hated Kenny.
You threatened to have him shot
if he didn't go to Australia.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.759
Bad things happen in threes, Patrick.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.799
Who's next? What's next?!

05:30.800 --> 05:31.839
Nobody's next.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.959
I'm cursed.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.679
Come on, don't give me
that shit from your grandmother.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.519
I told Fergal, me son, not to
come home and he's murdered.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.519
I told Kenny, me brother, to stop
sending me begging letters, he dies.

05:45.320 --> 05:49.319
What if I tell our baby Katie
to stop crying? She might...!

05:51.880 --> 05:54.439
Oh, my God!

05:54.440 --> 05:57.999
Come on. You didn't mean that.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.759
Come on. You've got to speak to me.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.759
You've got to speak to me.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.999
Come on, say something!

06:15.320 --> 06:16.679
You seen my bike?

06:16.680 --> 06:18.519
Yeah, it's wrecked.

06:18.520 --> 06:22.519
Fuck.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.479
You had to pick the
bin stinking of fishes, didn't you?

06:30.480 --> 06:31.759
Who's following ya?

06:31.760 --> 06:33.399
People from work.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.039
What's in the bag?

06:35.040 --> 06:39.039
Stuff! Will you fuck off, Colombo?

06:43.200 --> 06:47.199
Oi!

06:48.120 --> 06:49.279
Are these your clothes?

06:49.280 --> 06:51.119
Put 'em back!

06:51.120 --> 06:51.759
How much?

06:51.760 --> 06:52.839
What?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.919
T-shirt?

06:54.920 --> 06:58.919
Er, 20, 30?

07:05.320 --> 07:09.319
Look, just get sorted
and get out of here.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.999
Shit!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.919
How many times do
I have to tell you?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.839
Next time, I'll shove 'em up
your arse. They'll be safer.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.679
What have you done now, Einstein?

07:20.680 --> 07:23.319
Einstein, Einstein!

07:23.320 --> 07:26.359
Am I green? Have I got a
bolt sticking out of my head?

07:26.360 --> 07:30.359
No, Shane. You have nothing
sticking out of your head.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.639
Tell me you're not being
chased by the fucking Maguires.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.879
You know 'em?

07:36.880 --> 07:39.239
They live next door. You can't
stay here, they'll kill us both.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.439
They won't look under their nose.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.439
No way.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.479
I paid for a room, I'm staying.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.879
Fine. Keep your money.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.639
It'll take more than a few
quid to keep Paddy off my back.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.199
Fine. How much do you want?

07:51.200 --> 07:55.199
There's ten grand's worth of
scratchcards in 'ere.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.479
Fuckin' hell.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.679
Come on, just a word.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.679
Well, if not a word, then a smile.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.879
Come on, you know howbeautiful
you look when you smile.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.359
Bad things happen
in threes, she said.

08:22.360 --> 08:26.359
Fergal, Kenny...

08:28.120 --> 08:32.119
Chuckles.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.599
What happened to it?

08:38.600 --> 08:41.958
Well, I think it must
have swallowed something.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.959
Come on, Chuckles. Din-din time.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.839
Tragedy.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.479
She told me to clean out
the cage otherwise

08:51.480 --> 08:53.599
she'd flush it down the toilet.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.599
Now it's dead. Third thing.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.439
At least I'm trying something.

09:09.520 --> 09:13.279
I've been skimming
off Shane for months.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.279
Well, what would you do if you were
left in a lock-up with 10 grand of
scratchies inside?

09:17.680 --> 09:21.679
Leave 'em where they are, cos Paddy
Maguire'll break both your legs, you
know that?

09:21.760 --> 09:24.759
Well, once I've cashed them heain't
gonna see me for dust anyways.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.359
It'll take you weeks to get
through those.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.599
No, two days are all I've got.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.599
These were on the way to Glasgow
when Shane nicked them. When they
don't turn up Monday morning

09:33.400 --> 09:35.919
they'll bemade void,
the barcodes won't scan.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.919
So you've only got two days
to scratch them and cash them?

09:40.560 --> 09:42.719
70/30 split.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.599
Yeah, you see,

09:44.600 --> 09:48.599
I know what Paddy's really like,
so...

09:48.760 --> 09:51.999
60/40.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.999
60/40 and a blow-job.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.039
50/50.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.319
Fine.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.039
You missed out, you.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.439
Anna Sampson's blow jobs are
t' best in Manchester and

10:05.440 --> 10:07.239
it's not just me saying that.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.839
If you're staying,

10:08.840 --> 10:12.039
you're up in the attic and
you don't fucking come down.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.239
We should get to work.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.919
The Chatsworth estate is in trouble

10:16.920 --> 10:20.559
but the trouble is not crime,
it's health.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.599
A recent government survey
showed Chatsworth to be

10:23.600 --> 10:25.359
a UK heart attack hot spot.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.959
My Brendan was fat.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.959
He had heart attack written all
over him. It was crime did him.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.599
Shot.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.439
Mind you, he were carrying
a bag of chips at the time.

10:36.440 --> 10:42.079
This 250,000 which I have personally
secured from the council

10:42.080 --> 10:44.079
marks a major investment for us.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.439
On Monday, work will begin

10:46.440 --> 10:49.279
on the first Chatsworth
co-operative health centre.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.279
And to kick it all off this weekend,
the Chatsworth fun run.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.519
Get over it, it's not a real cheque!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.079
You're late.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.159
The bike wouldn't start.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.439
Sorry.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.599
Not looking goodfor the first week,
is it?

11:13.600 --> 11:17.159
Fast, hot and extra cheese.
You'll do well to remember that.

11:17.160 --> 11:21.159
Right.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.519
You know, I love biking nights like
this, the wind in your hair and that.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.119
Under yer 'elmet, obviously.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.719
Not like I've got any hair, but...

11:30.720 --> 11:34.719
Bullshit!

11:38.440 --> 11:39.479
A fun run?

11:39.480 --> 11:42.319
A fun run?

11:42.320 --> 11:44.719
A fun run?

11:44.720 --> 11:47.239
Yes, Frank, a fun run.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.999
Running isn't fun, just an excuse
for wankers in vests to show us

11:51.000 --> 11:52.599
how expensive their trainers are.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.479
There's 500 quid if you win.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.559
500 quid, is it?

11:56.560 --> 11:59.279
I should enter.
Save you having to wear out

11:59.280 --> 12:00.919
the tread in those new trainers.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.279
Fuck off.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.919
I always wear trainers.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.919
Digging,
now there's a fucking challenge.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.959
A fun dig, that'd be thecorrect
sort of competition.

12:09.960 --> 12:13.079
Might get a few useful
things done round here -

12:13.080 --> 12:17.079
public works, digs for victory,
Victorians in the sewers, all that.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.719
But will they sort that out?
Will they bollocks.

12:19.720 --> 12:23.559
Because working manwould win
at digging, wouldn't he?

12:23.560 --> 12:27.559
Running makes you healthy.
I have never heard so much bollocks
in all my life.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.799
Look, running man?

12:29.800 --> 12:33.799
Look at him, big legs,
no fucking arms.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.919
FuckingGallaghers!

13:06.120 --> 13:09.679
For fuck's sake,
can we slow down a bit?

13:09.680 --> 13:12.239
Another tenner!

13:12.240 --> 13:14.319
I haven't had this much fun in ages.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.319
Yeah, cos you're a freak!

13:30.080 --> 13:34.079
DOOR CREAKS

13:43.040 --> 13:45.599
Need a word.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.239
What time is it?

13:47.240 --> 13:50.159
Never you mind.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.679
My wife has a beautifulvoice
but she won't speak. Why?

13:53.680 --> 13:56.479
Cos she lost her son
and it's sending her mad

13:56.480 --> 13:58.959
so it's time to get her a new one.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.679
What you want? Fertility tips?

14:00.680 --> 14:04.679
Don't be fucking cocky!

14:05.240 --> 14:07.359
You're gonna marry our daughter.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.639
Join our family.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.479
What?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.759
Welcome to the Maguires, son.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.759
Right?

14:17.400 --> 14:21.399
I'll leave you be.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.959
Is there no room in this house
you keep fuckingclean?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.799
You know the Maguires'd happily tax
us up

14:49.800 --> 14:51.399
then beat the living shit out of us?

14:51.400 --> 14:53.679
Oh, live a little.
People pay a fortune

14:53.680 --> 14:56.919
for the kick of extreme sports.
And we've invented a new one.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.719
Pure adrenaline rush -

14:58.720 --> 15:02.119
nicking off the local psycho,
asleep only a few metres away.

15:02.120 --> 15:06.119
Yeah, you've definitely lost it.

15:16.360 --> 15:20.359
About bloody time!

15:21.680 --> 15:25.679
I'm not paying for these,
they're cold. Sod off!

15:27.080 --> 15:31.079
I've gotta pay for them
if you don't!

15:35.240 --> 15:36.679
Wanker's cramp?

15:36.680 --> 15:39.359
Fuck off!

15:39.360 --> 15:40.679
Oh, fuck.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.639
Shit, look at this! Five grand.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.559
Five fucking grand.
I've just won five fucking grand.

15:46.560 --> 15:50.559
Shit, that's mint!

15:58.160 --> 16:00.999
No, what are you doing?
That was a winner.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.239
For prizes above 75

16:03.240 --> 16:06.639
you must provide proof of identity
and also fill in the claim form.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.799
You fill your name on the back of
us and you're going to fucking jail.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.519
Do not pass go,
do not collect five grand.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.319
75 is the maximum for us.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.319
Don't look so upset.
I'll let you rip the next one.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.559
You notice we kissed?

16:22.560 --> 16:26.399
Yeah.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.119
You got someone else?

16:28.120 --> 16:31.119
No.Don't you fancy me, then?

16:31.120 --> 16:35.119
No...

16:35.760 --> 16:39.759
Only this says different.

17:08.480 --> 17:12.479
What's the matter?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.519
My life's shit.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.358
Change it, then.
It's your responsibility.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.719
What, says girl on run from mob.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.799
At least I know I'm alive.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.759
Yeah, for now.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.559
I've got to get away.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.079
That's sort of obvious.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.319
I'm going to Birmingham.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.679
Good choice!

17:32.680 --> 17:35.439
I've got mates.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.119
Mate. Chance of a job.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.079
Come with us.

17:41.080 --> 17:45.079
New start and all that crap.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.999
And that'd be a good thing?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.999
Dunno yet. It's got to be
better than this, though.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.719
What do you know about my life?

17:55.720 --> 17:57.879
Fuck all.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.639
And I was talking
about this shitty estate.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.399
Come on.

18:02.400 --> 18:06.399
Let's get scratching.

18:07.120 --> 18:11.119
I always say that after sex!

18:19.080 --> 18:21.159
'Welcome to the Maguires, son.'

18:21.160 --> 18:25.159
# BRIDAL MARCH

18:25.720 --> 18:26.919
'The Maguires, son.'

18:26.920 --> 18:30.919
# BRIDAL MARCH

18:31.680 --> 18:32.999
'Maguires, son.'

18:33.000 --> 18:36.759
# BRIDAL MARCH

18:36.760 --> 18:39.479
Fuck, what's with you?

18:39.480 --> 18:41.799
Nothing.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.279
You've got toothpaste
round your gob.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.279
Don't rub it off.
It looks kind of sweet.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.559
Fuck, we fell asleep.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.679
Yeah.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.079
How many have we done?

19:16.080 --> 19:18.639
Enough so we'll still be scratching
around Wednesday.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.039
Shit!

19:20.040 --> 19:24.039
Don't worry, I've got an idea.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.119
Debbie? Debbie?

19:32.840 --> 19:35.519
Debbie?

19:35.520 --> 19:36.719
We need your help.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.719
Right, we want fifties and
highers here, 10 and unders here,

19:42.120 --> 19:45.719
anything in between there
and all the duds in the bin bag.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.399
We need to make a list of
all the newsagents

19:48.400 --> 19:49.999
within a five-mile radius.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.959
I'll do a dry run to
check these cash at all.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.919
I'll do it. Give me one for 50 quid.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.919
All the fifties are here.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.199
You're supposed to be out the front

19:59.200 --> 20:01.719
shouting "fresh fruit",
not sat in here.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.799
I told you I couldn't shout.
All this healthy eating's well

20:04.800 --> 20:08.799
and good but it won'tsort out
my strep throat.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.959
Do you want some bananas, mate?
They're Egyptian.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.919
No, ta.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.599
Extra iron content.
Healthy Chatsworth.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.599
Thank you.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.959
And no one told me about this
tomato being a fruit, neither.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.959
Or I'd have asked for extra
if I'd known.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.199
Well, if it isn't the invisible man.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.519
Look, I don't wanna talk about
it, I just what this cashed.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.799
Like fuck you don'twanna
talk about it.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.759
Two hours late, you didn'teven
bother coming in yesterday.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.759
Two hours late, you didn'teven
bother coming in yesterday.
You sacked me!Since when?

20:45.960 --> 20:49.959
"Financial pressures have forced us
into a situation where we cannot
maintain our current staffing level."

20:52.520 --> 20:53.799
I didn't write this.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.879
Well, it sounds like you.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.279
I don't know anything about it.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.919
Well, Kash knows.

20:58.920 --> 21:02.919
Well, clearly
there's been a mistake.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.999
It's simple. You can't bear
to have me around any more.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.479
Ian,I think you must've
misunderstood.

21:09.480 --> 21:13.479
No, I haven't. He's a bastard!
Tell him to fuck his job!

21:13.520 --> 21:16.359
Ian, you work forme.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.359
This ismyshop.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.559
What are you working on, Liam?

21:25.560 --> 21:29.559
A castle.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.719
Where'd you get these cards from?

21:34.840 --> 21:37.199
Let go of her!

21:37.200 --> 21:38.359
Oh, fuck!

21:38.360 --> 21:39.879
Get off me!

21:39.880 --> 21:41.439
You've got to stop her!

21:41.440 --> 21:42.839
Do you know it?

21:42.840 --> 21:43.519
Know what?

21:43.520 --> 21:46.599
Thousands of scratch cardsstolen
off my dad by your family.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.919
Fucking Anne Frankhere living in
your loft!

21:48.920 --> 21:50.359
You knew, didn't you?

21:50.360 --> 21:51.799
No.You bastard!

21:51.800 --> 21:54.079
I knew nothing!

21:54.080 --> 21:56.479
Good, thenthe rest of you
better watch out.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.799
Stop her, she's hurting me!

21:58.800 --> 21:59.799
Lip, you don't understand.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.919
Is this you?

22:00.920 --> 22:03.759
They were wankers to her, she's
not gonna rip them off for fun!

22:03.760 --> 22:04.799
Mandy, stop!

22:04.800 --> 22:07.199
What's your dad gonna do
if he finds out about this?

22:07.200 --> 22:08.999
This is my familyyou're
ripping off!

22:09.000 --> 22:11.239
Yeah, are me and Katie
not your family, too?

22:11.240 --> 22:14.119
If your dad gets hold of Ian,
he'll rip his bollocks off.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.999
Who do you think'll be next in line?
You go round there

22:17.000 --> 22:20.999
and create trouble and that is
gonna cause one heap of shit for us.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.839
Lip gets a cut, same as any of you.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.519
Sure.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.519
Thanks.

22:44.080 --> 22:48.079
I'm on time, I know I am.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.319
Back from a run?

23:02.320 --> 23:04.519
Just resting my muscles.

23:04.520 --> 23:05.759
Stiff joints.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.999
You'll have to let me give
you a massage some time.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.999
Keep your cock in your pants,
Callum Best. I'm not having your
filthy hands all over me.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.319
Yeah,well, don't overdo it,
will you?

23:15.320 --> 23:17.399
I'm fine.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.599
I was going out again, actually.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.639
Great.

23:20.640 --> 23:24.639
Maybe you and I should run together.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.679
36p.

23:36.680 --> 23:37.599
What?

23:37.600 --> 23:41.599
36p.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.159
Ian's still not shown his face.

23:46.160 --> 23:50.159
He could be anywhere,
considering you've sacked him.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.039
See, he's thinking you've done
it because you're bored of him.

23:54.040 --> 23:58.039
What I'm wondering is, when every
bill's coming in red, why you're
not paying 'em.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.439
Look, I had to cut some
overheads, that's all.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.879
We need to talk to the bank, take
out a temporary loan on the shop.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.279
Onmyshop?

24:05.280 --> 24:09.279
It's only temporary!
Look, three months - tops.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.599
As soon as the health centre gets
started, it'll be kickbacks.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.039
Plenty enough to pay it off.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.999
We're talking, what - 15 grand, max.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.999
15 grand? What the fuck have
you spent all that money on?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.999
Look, you know what I do.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.799
It's important I project
a good image of myself.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.359
I've got to travel,
for council business.

24:29.360 --> 24:33.359
Meeting and getting to know
my constituents.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.959
It's not cheap!

24:35.960 --> 24:39.039
I've made an appointment to see the
bank manager - tomorrow.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.759
No, not the shop.

24:41.760 --> 24:45.079
If we're gonna borrow,
we'll borrow on the house.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.639
I've already done that.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.479
This is to save the house.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.639
Hey, please, Ron,

24:55.640 --> 24:59.119
I really need you to do this for me.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.239
Last time.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.599
You can fuck right off!

25:02.600 --> 25:06.599
I changed my religion for you,
I looked after your kids, I looked
after your mam, I even looked

25:07.200 --> 25:09.399
the other way when you fucked
my fucking staff!

25:09.400 --> 25:11.319
And now you want my shop?

25:11.320 --> 25:15.319
The only thing
I've ever had that were mine?

25:15.400 --> 25:19.399
You're not having
anything ever again.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.599
It's over, Kash!

25:25.280 --> 25:27.799
You're leaving me?

25:27.800 --> 25:30.559
No, I'm not.

25:30.560 --> 25:34.559
You're leavingme.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.399
You fixed it yet?

25:46.400 --> 25:47.719
Very funny.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.719
You're gonna have to hurry up.
I need it this afternoon.

25:49.720 --> 25:53.559
Fuck off! I'm supposed to be using it
for work in case you hadn't noticed.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.319
Hello there, Philip.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.479
Hiya.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.719
The name's Patrick,
don't wear it out.

25:59.720 --> 26:03.719
But you can't call me
Dad just yet either.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.119
Allow me.

26:06.120 --> 26:10.119
In there?

26:12.200 --> 26:16.199
Come here.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.079
I just wanted to give you this.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.239
A bit of a family heirloom.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.599
That's very kind, Paddy.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.599
Dad?

26:23.600 --> 26:25.519
I kept that diamond up my...

26:25.520 --> 26:27.959
The only place wherethe screws
wouldn't look,

26:27.960 --> 26:30.799
for three months inside Strangeways.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.519
Ooh!

26:32.520 --> 26:34.479
It's very treasured.

26:34.480 --> 26:38.479
But as I've only one daughter,
I want her to have it.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.719
Thanks, Paddy.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.639
Dad?
Why don't you shut up, Shane?

26:41.640 --> 26:45.639
That's the bike.

26:49.900 --> 26:53.459
Where are they?! D'you know
what you're dealin' with right now?!

26:53.460 --> 26:55.579
Answer me! Come on!

26:55.580 --> 26:57.579
Where are they?!

26:57.580 --> 27:00.299
Fuck! Get yer 'ead down!
And stay down, now!

27:00.300 --> 27:02.699
Both you and I know
you were on that bike!

27:02.700 --> 27:04.899
So you can do this the
easy way or the hard way!

27:04.900 --> 27:07.339
If you've done something bad,
Carl, you've gotta own up to it!

27:07.340 --> 27:09.139
If you've done something bad,
Carl, you've gotta own up to it!
Mum, I dunno what
he's talkin' about!

27:09.140 --> 27:10.179
It were me!

27:10.180 --> 27:10.579
Ian!

27:10.580 --> 27:11.659
I crashed it!

27:11.660 --> 27:13.179
Right!

27:13.180 --> 27:15.939
You fucked ma bike up?!
You little...!

27:15.940 --> 27:17.219
Where is she?

27:17.220 --> 27:19.819
I dunno. She were too quick for me -
I couldn't keep up.

27:19.820 --> 27:20.539
Wrong answer.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.619
Wrong answer.
I'm not lying.

27:21.620 --> 27:23.579
Actually, she fucked ma bike...

27:23.580 --> 27:26.419
It's not your bike! It's
not even mine! It's the pizza bike!

27:26.420 --> 27:27.539
It's not your bike! It's
not even mine! It's the pizza bike!
Shut it!

27:27.540 --> 27:27.979
Carl, shut up!

27:27.980 --> 27:29.059
Carl, shut up!
Answer me!

27:29.060 --> 27:32.859
Seriously, Paddy, she damaged
ma stuff, so when you find her,
I wouldn't mind a word.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.219
Search the 'ouse, Dad.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.219
No way! This is our property!

27:36.220 --> 27:37.259
It was our property that went
missin' in the first place.

27:37.260 --> 27:38.939
He's tellin' you the truth, Dad.

27:38.940 --> 27:39.499
You stay out of this.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.059
I live 'ere. Don't you think I'd
notice if they were nicking off yer?

27:43.060 --> 27:47.059
He's tellin' the truth.

27:51.780 --> 27:55.139
You'd better be.

27:55.140 --> 27:59.139
Come on, Shane. We're outta here.

27:59.660 --> 28:03.659
Shane!

28:04.780 --> 28:06.339
Thanks, babe.

28:06.340 --> 28:08.579
Don't you ever make me
do anything like that again!

28:08.780 --> 28:12.779
OK?!

28:16.260 --> 28:20.259
Get in.

28:28.420 --> 28:31.219
Thanks.

28:31.220 --> 28:32.219
For what?

28:32.220 --> 28:34.019
For standing up to Paddy.

28:34.020 --> 28:36.139
I thought that you'd give me up.

28:36.140 --> 28:38.699
In your place, I might have.

28:38.700 --> 28:41.419
Took some guts.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.299
I didn't really think about it.

28:43.300 --> 28:47.179
Could have got your head kicked in.

28:47.180 --> 28:48.219
Sorry.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.099
Oh, I didn't think of that!

28:50.100 --> 28:53.299
Shit, you reckon it's too
late to put in a phone call?

28:53.300 --> 28:57.299
Tell Paddy you're here?!

29:03.940 --> 29:06.979
This is a lot of money.

29:06.980 --> 29:10.699
And I wouldn't ask, it's just...

29:10.700 --> 29:13.939
My dad spends all the social
on a scratchies and,

29:13.940 --> 29:15.419
maybe it was stupid of me,

29:15.420 --> 29:19.419
but...when I found out
he finally won,

29:19.580 --> 29:23.179
I promised my brother
I'd buy him sausages.

29:23.180 --> 29:27.179
It's not often we can
afford meat at our house.

29:33.740 --> 29:36.139
Where to next?

29:36.140 --> 29:39.579
Try Rusholme, there's
loads you can hit round there.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.179
How's it going?

29:41.180 --> 29:42.459
It's fine.

29:42.460 --> 29:43.619
Is Mandy?

29:43.620 --> 29:47.339
Yeah, she's fine.

29:47.340 --> 29:49.139
Right.

29:49.140 --> 29:51.179
What are you looking at me
like that for?

29:51.180 --> 29:54.499
There's some lucky buggers
around here.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.699
20, 40...

29:57.700 --> 30:00.459
And...

30:00.460 --> 30:02.539
I've...

30:02.540 --> 30:05.059
let...

30:05.060 --> 30:09.059
everyone down.

30:09.140 --> 30:13.139
I can no longer...

30:13.540 --> 30:17.539
A few things got blown in the canal,
but we think we got everything.

30:19.260 --> 30:21.259
It could be a while
before the body

30:21.260 --> 30:25.139
shows up and, you know,
sometimes it never does.

30:25.140 --> 30:29.139
Even then,
you might not recognise...

30:29.580 --> 30:31.379
What's going on?

30:31.380 --> 30:34.059
It's Kash. He's taken his own life.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.699
There was a note.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.939
Fucking coward!
He's left me in loads of debt.

30:38.940 --> 30:41.859
Well, we'll leave you to it,
Yvonne, OK?

30:41.860 --> 30:42.979
OK.

30:42.980 --> 30:46.419
Come down the station later and
we'll have your forms to sign.

30:46.420 --> 30:50.419
Thank you.

30:54.180 --> 30:58.179
I don't believe this.

31:01.340 --> 31:03.859
Tragic, in't it?

31:03.860 --> 31:07.859
I can no longer...

31:08.180 --> 31:11.339
face...

31:11.340 --> 31:15.339
the embarrassment...

31:16.260 --> 31:18.139
Shame...

31:18.140 --> 31:21.739
The family are never going to
believe this, you know that, Von?

31:21.740 --> 31:25.379
The shit you've left behind, Kash,
they're gonna want to believe it.

31:25.380 --> 31:29.379
Tuck me right into the Muslim bosom,
because I'm keeping them.

31:29.980 --> 31:33.379
Family, kids and
the faith and the shop.

31:33.380 --> 31:37.379
You'd better hurry if you're going
to make that 3:15pm at Sheffield.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.899
He has fucked with us
once too often.

31:49.660 --> 31:52.459
We've got the money.

31:52.460 --> 31:56.459
Are you still up for Birmingham?

31:57.860 --> 32:00.819
Look...

32:00.820 --> 32:02.259
..I'm not a bastard...

32:02.260 --> 32:06.259
I was sort of assuming that.

32:09.980 --> 32:13.979
Not like...

32:14.740 --> 32:18.739
Well, I'm not...

32:20.300 --> 32:21.819
I'm gay.

32:21.820 --> 32:25.819
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

32:26.420 --> 32:30.419
Brew?

32:30.860 --> 32:34.659
I'm gay.

32:34.660 --> 32:36.859
Is that it?

32:36.860 --> 32:39.299
Do you want me to go
into a fit or something?

32:39.300 --> 32:41.339
I fuck blokes.

32:41.340 --> 32:44.139
You're the only woman
I've ever slept with.

32:44.140 --> 32:45.339
I'm...

32:45.340 --> 32:46.619
Gay?

32:46.620 --> 32:49.659
So what? I've had
it off with girls.

32:49.660 --> 32:52.339
Why put yourself in a box?

32:52.340 --> 32:56.019
We made each other come,
no-one died.

32:56.020 --> 32:59.339
I knew you were a virgin!

32:59.340 --> 33:01.819
No, you didn't.

33:01.820 --> 33:03.499
How?

33:03.500 --> 33:06.379
I'm not sure.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.539
Well, what did I do wrong?

33:08.540 --> 33:12.539
Could've turned it up
a couple of notches.

33:14.100 --> 33:17.779
I'll show you mine, again...

33:17.780 --> 33:19.819
G, A, Y.

33:19.820 --> 33:23.219
So you S, A, Y.

33:23.220 --> 33:27.219
I know you fancy me.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.219
Try it again?

33:43.220 --> 33:46.299
Why cut things out?

33:46.300 --> 33:50.299
There's a world of possibilities,
especially in Birmingham, so I hear.

33:54.340 --> 33:58.339
Don't try and bum me though,
the Maguires might hear me screams!

33:59.660 --> 34:03.259
Kenny touched many
lives in many different ways.

34:03.260 --> 34:07.259
It's so nice to have people whose
lives he touched with us today.

34:07.860 --> 34:10.978
By webcam from Chatsworth, England,

34:10.980 --> 34:14.498
we welcome Kenny's sister, Mimi
and family.

34:14.500 --> 34:18.498
And here, in Rafferty's Creek,
the two Petes.

34:18.940 --> 34:22.299
Bruce, Little Jo and,

34:22.300 --> 34:23.859
of course, Ritchie.

34:23.860 --> 34:27.458
In fact, they were all with
Kenny at his birthday barbecue....

34:27.460 --> 34:31.458
I just don't see why I've
got to wear this monkey suit.

34:32.739 --> 34:36.739
That suit did me for four trials and
15 funerals and a wedding as a boy.

34:37.900 --> 34:41.899
You look a fine young man in it, son.
Doesn't he, Mimi?

34:43.820 --> 34:46.219
It's too tight, it doesn't
even fit me properly.

34:46.219 --> 34:49.619
You'd better be wearing underpants.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.059
Ah...

34:51.060 --> 34:52.739
...and not the coffin.

34:52.739 --> 34:56.739
So any of you that have a few words
to say about Kenny, say 'em now.

34:57.900 --> 35:01.659
Why don't you say a few words, love?

35:01.660 --> 35:04.299
Any friends.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.459
We could put a phone call in.

35:05.460 --> 35:09.059
Any acquaintance.

35:09.060 --> 35:11.379
Anyone from Chatsworth.
Anyone at all.

35:11.380 --> 35:15.379
I'm sure they'd like something.

35:16.020 --> 35:18.419
No takers.

35:18.420 --> 35:22.419
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection...

35:22.820 --> 35:25.739
How long you gonna keep this up?

35:25.740 --> 35:28.619
Because I'm not sure I
can take this much longer.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.619
...our brother, Kenny.

35:30.620 --> 35:34.019
And we commit his body
to the ground.

35:34.020 --> 35:38.019
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

35:57.540 --> 35:59.059
And lo,

35:59.060 --> 36:02.179
as the child slept...

36:02.180 --> 36:06.179
there came three kings
from the East...

36:07.180 --> 36:11.179
bearing...

36:11.220 --> 36:15.219
..gifts.

36:25.460 --> 36:29.459
MUSIC PLAYS

36:35.140 --> 36:36.819
Come on, everyone!

36:36.820 --> 36:39.099
Lovely firm buttocks.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.979
He'll do anything I ask.

36:40.980 --> 36:43.819
Close one eye,
could be David Beckham.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.819
Keep the change, pet.

36:45.820 --> 36:48.459
She's taking me to Gran Canaria
at the end of the month, aren't ya?

36:48.460 --> 36:49.499
Yeah!

36:49.500 --> 36:50.779
Who's paying for that, then?

36:50.780 --> 36:54.779
357 hits I had, but I
chose you, didn't I, Bradford?

37:07.380 --> 37:10.419
Ooh!

37:10.420 --> 37:11.939
Lucky man.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.259
She spoils me.

37:13.260 --> 37:15.499
Travel agents this afternoon?

37:15.500 --> 37:19.499
Well, maybe. I find it really hard
to think money matters through,

37:19.780 --> 37:23.779
cos I have migraine, you see. But,
if we lie down together we could...

37:24.940 --> 37:26.899
discuss it!

37:26.900 --> 37:30.899
Right you are.

37:31.220 --> 37:33.419
I want what she's having.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.579
A pint and two Es, Karen, please.

37:35.580 --> 37:39.579
Money first, Frank.

37:43.100 --> 37:46.659
Ah.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.059
Job done.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.259
That's a scratchcard, Frank.

37:51.260 --> 37:55.019
Correction, that is a
winning scratchcard. 20 quid.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.979
Oh, fuck off, Frank.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.979
It's legal tender!

37:58.980 --> 38:02.979
So go and cash it,
come back and I'll serve yer.

38:04.620 --> 38:08.619
Fucking Pol Pot behind the bar.

38:09.060 --> 38:10.699
# Do I see you... #

38:10.700 --> 38:12.739
Oh!

38:12.740 --> 38:15.259
Where'd you get
the scratchcard, Frank?

38:15.260 --> 38:16.339
You dirty bastard!

38:16.340 --> 38:18.099
Not the face, anything but...!

38:18.100 --> 38:19.859
Where did you get
the fucking scratchcard!

38:19.860 --> 38:21.299
Liam!

38:21.300 --> 38:24.699
I wasn't gonna, you know, steal
it off... I'm not going to steal it

38:24.700 --> 38:28.699
of little Liam, am I now?
You can have it back!

38:33.940 --> 38:36.499
Look, Paddy, I'm going to do it, OK?

38:36.500 --> 38:38.659
I just need time to do it right.

38:38.660 --> 38:42.659
There's a slightly more pressing
matter needs discussion first.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.939
That's a whole lap of the estate
you've fallen behind now.

38:53.140 --> 38:55.299
Aah! Aah!

38:55.300 --> 38:57.699
You all right?

38:57.700 --> 38:58.379
Pervert!

38:58.380 --> 38:59.379
You've pulled a hamstring.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.219
I'll be fine.

39:01.220 --> 39:03.699
I just need to run it off.

39:03.700 --> 39:06.139
Aaah! Let me go! Let me go!

39:06.140 --> 39:08.019
You don't half kick up a fuss, you.

39:08.020 --> 39:10.939
Let me go right now,
or I'll grab you in the bollocks!

39:10.940 --> 39:12.899
You're injured.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.499
This is the last time, bozo.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.579
Let me go right now!

39:17.580 --> 39:21.579
Fine.

39:24.260 --> 39:28.259
Frank here tells me there's a
pile of scratchcards in your house.

39:28.380 --> 39:32.019
Bollocks. What you on about?

39:32.020 --> 39:33.579
Liam...scratchcards.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.379
Scratchcard. There may
only have just been the one.

39:35.380 --> 39:37.859
You said there were fucking loads.

39:37.860 --> 39:39.419
Shut up, the pair of yous.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.139
Does Mandy know?

39:42.140 --> 39:43.379
Course she doesn't.

39:43.380 --> 39:46.539
So you lied to my daughter
as well as me?

39:46.540 --> 39:49.139
Let's get this straight.
I don't give a shit about

39:49.140 --> 39:51.579
these missing scratchcards.
That's Shane's worry.

39:51.580 --> 39:55.019
This is about the lack of respect
you're showing me,

39:55.020 --> 39:56.819
your family.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.499
I want the girl.

39:58.500 --> 40:02.499
Your brother will be fine.
But you bring her to me. Understand?

40:03.180 --> 40:04.019
Yeah.

40:04.020 --> 40:08.019
Right.

40:10.540 --> 40:11.539
Shall I leave you to it?

40:11.540 --> 40:12.179
Stay there.

40:12.180 --> 40:16.179
Sit down.

40:18.060 --> 40:19.059
Paddy knows you're here.

40:19.060 --> 40:21.099
What?!

40:21.100 --> 40:23.619
Fucking hell.
I didn't know you had it in you.

40:23.620 --> 40:24.579
Piss off!

40:24.580 --> 40:26.339
You have to go that way.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.619
The Maguires live that way!

40:28.620 --> 40:30.499
Yes, but they're waiting in the yard.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.739
but you've got to get out of here.

40:33.740 --> 40:36.539
I'll sort some transport out.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.459
Get the bag!

40:38.460 --> 40:42.459
I will do. Go on.

40:55.300 --> 40:59.299
You know what?
I didn't like that job anyway.

41:04.940 --> 41:08.939
Birmingham, here we come!

41:14.260 --> 41:16.019
Too late, Paddy. She's gone.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.779
To think I wanted you in my family!

41:18.780 --> 41:21.259
Think he deserves
his pound of flesh, don't you?

41:21.260 --> 41:22.339
Don't you touch him.

41:22.340 --> 41:25.499
Your boyfriend has been keeping
one or two things secret from you.

41:25.500 --> 41:26.499
No, he hasn't.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.379
That's another fucking lie
he's been telling me!

41:29.380 --> 41:32.939
Shane's a bully, so people
steal from him. It's his own fault.

41:32.940 --> 41:36.459
You hit Lip and you're hitting me
and I'll never speak to you again.

41:36.460 --> 41:37.099
Really?

41:37.100 --> 41:41.099
Really?
You can forget me and forget Katie.
I'll be dead to you. Understand?

41:41.500 --> 41:45.499
Noooo! Stop!
That's the third bad thing.

41:45.820 --> 41:47.979
You spoke. She spoke!

41:47.980 --> 41:50.299
She said she'd be dead to us.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.819
I thought you couldn't
fucking speak.

41:51.820 --> 41:53.459
I've broken the curse.

41:53.460 --> 41:56.979
I've saved Mandy!

41:56.980 --> 42:00.979
You heard what she said.
Don't touch him.

42:05.620 --> 42:07.579
Oh, my darling!

42:07.580 --> 42:11.579
As if I'd do anything to hurt you!

42:22.340 --> 42:26.339
No pressure, Ian, but there's
psychos coming to jump on my head.

42:30.700 --> 42:34.699
I don't know what to do.

42:35.820 --> 42:37.379
I can see how we fit.

42:37.380 --> 42:38.619
We do!

42:38.620 --> 42:42.059
But I can't imagine a future.
This isn't real.

42:42.060 --> 42:45.219
It can be.

42:45.220 --> 42:48.259
You know when a bloke goes past
and you check out his arse?

42:49.140 --> 42:51.019
I don't care.

42:51.020 --> 42:55.019
You do! You will!

42:55.020 --> 42:58.139
I don't want to go on my own.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.939
I know.

43:00.940 --> 43:02.939
Things happen around me.

43:02.940 --> 43:06.179
You'll never get bored.

43:06.180 --> 43:08.899
Don't go for a man who prefers men.

43:08.900 --> 43:12.019
It's really fucking demeaning.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.659
You should have
someone who worships you.

43:13.660 --> 43:16.379
"Worships"?That is gay.

43:16.380 --> 43:17.899
Someone who wants you, then.

43:17.900 --> 43:21.219
You want me.

43:21.220 --> 43:23.339
Not enough.

43:23.340 --> 43:27.339
No?

43:29.500 --> 43:33.499
Doesn't look like
we've got the balls, does it?

43:34.780 --> 43:38.779
Or the heart.

43:40.580 --> 43:41.579
That's the clincher.

43:41.580 --> 43:45.579
Yeah.

44:18.260 --> 44:20.819
What, Liam gets some
and I get nothing? >

44:20.820 --> 44:22.619
Yeah, Liam did some
of the scratching.

44:22.620 --> 44:24.539
Did anyone order pizza?

44:24.540 --> 44:26.699
Nobody ordered pizza.

44:26.700 --> 44:28.899
This is a social call,
isn't it, Carl?

44:28.900 --> 44:32.459
Where's the fucking bike?

44:32.460 --> 44:36.459
Shit!

44:40.860 --> 44:44.339
You liked it,

44:44.340 --> 44:48.339
but you're still a bender?

44:48.620 --> 44:50.059
Yeah, but are you?

44:50.060 --> 44:51.779
Yeah, course I am.

44:51.780 --> 44:55.779
It's not like I've got a choice.

44:55.980 --> 44:58.659
You liked it, didn't you?

44:58.660 --> 45:02.659
Yeah.

45:07.540 --> 45:10.339
What's that?

45:10.340 --> 45:12.619
Maguire family heirloom.

45:12.620 --> 45:14.899
Jeez, where'd you find that?

45:14.900 --> 45:17.099
Paddy give it us.
Wanted me to give it to Mandy.

45:17.100 --> 45:19.339
Fuck! >

45:19.340 --> 45:21.059
You gonna?

45:21.060 --> 45:22.899
Don't know.

45:22.900 --> 45:25.179
Thought I would.

45:25.180 --> 45:29.179
But now I don't have to,
I'm not sure!

45:31.740 --> 45:35.739
So did you go down on her,
Mr Pussy Hound?!

45:37.660 --> 45:41.099
What's that got to do with anything?

45:41.100 --> 45:44.939
Well, did you?

45:44.940 --> 45:46.059
No.

45:46.060 --> 45:49.619
Yes!I knew it!

45:49.620 --> 45:53.179
You can get off but you can't
get on. You're a total gayer!

45:53.180 --> 45:57.179
Well, that's what I've been saying!

45:59.140 --> 46:02.979
'Knowing how ignorant you are is the
first step on the path to wisdom.

46:02.980 --> 46:06.379
'I thought the cock was the
ruling organ - convinced. And wrong.'

46:06.380 --> 46:09.459
See where that went?

46:09.460 --> 46:10.579
What?

46:10.580 --> 46:12.419
Paddy's ring.

46:12.420 --> 46:13.819
Fuck!

46:13.820 --> 46:15.339
Fuck!

46:15.340 --> 46:18.499
'It's the heart calls the shots,
and it's a nutjob.

46:18.500 --> 46:20.299
'Oh, Christ, then there's the brain.

46:20.300 --> 46:23.899
'Here's a thought: all those
straight men I've had sex with.

46:23.900 --> 46:25.699
'You tell me what that's about.

46:25.700 --> 46:29.379
'I have no fucking idea.'
