00:12.638 --> 00:14.389
Crystal, I just want to tell you

00:14.473 --> 00:16.015
that you've had a great practice today.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.100
Thanks.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.811
You're finally getting
back to full strength.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.897
-How do you feel?
-Fine.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.775
-I'm really proud of you.
-I have to go.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.485
But just come here for a second.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.569
I-- Don't.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.655
You can trust me. Just relax.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.740
-Please stop.
-It's okay.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.575
Please! No! Stop!

00:39.289 --> 00:40.582
You can't tell anyone.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.794
-Crystal.
-You can't.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.565
Crystal, breakfast is ready!

01:14.700 --> 01:15.784
Crystal!

01:20.038 --> 01:21.164
I'm coming!

02:51.547 --> 02:53.715
Hey, Jenna. It's Harold Phillips.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.718
I got your number
from Melony at the barbershop.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.930
Look, I know it's been a while
and everything,

03:00.389 --> 03:03.392
but I was wondering if maybe
I could take you to dinner sometime.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.394
Catch up.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.396
I hear you still have
that beautiful smile.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.523
-Hey, Mom.
-Morning, baby.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.066
Who was that?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.943
Just an old friend bein' silly.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.869
I'm gonna go back to bed.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.496
Okay.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.962
The energy in the arena is electric.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.176
People are still making their way inside.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.636
She reaches the podium.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.639
The crowd goes wild.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.683
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:44.766 --> 03:48.228
the next president
of the United States of America.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.940
Damn! Look at her shoes!

03:52.024 --> 03:53.233
What are you doin'?

03:54.193 --> 03:58.363
I'm introducing our future president
of the United States of America. Yeah.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.240
-Excuse me.
-What does it look like I'm doing?

04:00.324 --> 04:03.452
Well, if you're done, POTUS is hungry.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.831
She needs waffles.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.085
She needs waffles or you need waffles?

04:12.169 --> 04:15.422
Well, I think we all need waffles.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.305
You still gonna make the peach cobbler
for the Carsons tonight?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.562
It was your idea. You don't have to.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.815
No, it's not like that.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.400
Then what's this look about?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.612
I don't know how Jenna's
gonna take the news.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.572
About Nick?

04:40.656 --> 04:43.325
Yeah. She cool, but she's stubborn.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.077
But it's a good thing for the team.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.828
The team?

04:47.746 --> 04:49.748
She only care about
puttin' Jace out front.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.877
Are you scared of Jenna Carson?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.379
Yeah, a little bit.

04:58.507 --> 05:01.301
Well, if you gonna be FOPOTUS,
you gotta get that together.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.178
What's FOPOTUS?

05:03.262 --> 05:04.596
Father…

05:05.639 --> 05:08.475
of the president of the United States.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.602
Time to practice your politics, baby.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.439
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:21.530 --> 05:22.781
It's go time. It's go time.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.664
Incoming!

05:31.665 --> 05:32.666
The hell?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.418
Look at him.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.879
-Hold up. What do you say?
-My bad.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.923
I taught you well.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.133
I hate you both.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.019
And I'm only on you
about your grades

05:52.102 --> 05:53.770
because you're a scholar-athlete.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.689
That means you don't get C's.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.110
You need to put in the work
on your term paper over the weekend

06:00.736 --> 06:02.779
and get that grade up. Understood?

06:03.822 --> 06:04.823
Crystal?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.492
Crystal?

06:19.129 --> 06:20.797
Have a good practice.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.510
And don't forget to text me
when you're on the bus home. Okay?

06:24.593 --> 06:26.094
Okay.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.221
I love you, baby.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.514
I love you too.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.477
Hey!

07:02.089 --> 07:03.423
Go on now.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.301
The buddy system.

07:07.928 --> 07:08.971
Hey!

07:11.181 --> 07:14.142
Come on, Vanessa. I'll walk with you.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.846
It really was sprained.

07:52.347 --> 07:57.436
But then… I stayed in the boot
for a couple more weeks after it healed.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
I just…

08:01.899 --> 08:04.276
didn't want to deal with him.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.113
When I got back, I thought it'd be okay.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.035
But it wasn't.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.662
You gonna tell your parents?

08:16.371 --> 08:17.414
I can't.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.208
You say he grabbed you.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.300
Did he do anything else?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.767
He grabbed me…

08:41.355 --> 08:42.731
But he wouldn't let go.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.401
I tried to get away.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.031
And he put his hand under my shirt.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.116
Crystal, what can I do?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.160
There's nothing to do.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.662
What are you talking about?

08:58.455 --> 08:59.540
I don't have proof.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.166
I don't need proof!

09:01.250 --> 09:02.709
No one's gonna believe me, Jace.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.003
It's my word against his.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.797
They'll say I'm lying.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.301
I can't lose basketball.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.975
Hey, man, I need you
to get my waves tight, man.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.852
Smooth it out like Denzel.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.396
Brother, I don't think
we gonna be able to do that, brother,

09:22.479 --> 09:24.565
'cause this a barbershop.
This is not the ER.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.569
Hey, Mel. Tell him, man.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.988
My waves stay fresh.
Everybody here's seasick.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.364
Sorry, Troy,

09:32.447 --> 09:34.283
but your waves are as shallow as you are.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.909
Hold up. Man.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.328
-Hey.
-Mr. Sawyer!

09:38.412 --> 09:39.997
What's up, Zo?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.582
Didn't I give you a line this week?

09:41.665 --> 09:43.375
Yes, you did, but I just copped you

09:43.458 --> 09:46.253
the limited-release Gladiator Highs
with the OG colorway.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.838
On the house, of course.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.216
You've come a long way
since your college days.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.802
You used to roll in here
smelling like last night's Henny.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.013
Oh, wow. All right.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.473
-But I appreciate it.
-No problem, man.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.187
-Icon?
-Who's askin'?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.439
Alonzo Powers.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.983
I used to play against you
in the circuit back in the day, man.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.235
-Oh, okay. Hey, what's up?
-Good to see you, man.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.320
Good to see you.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.906
Alonzo here is taking the world by storm,

10:13.989 --> 10:16.617
-one basketball phenom at a time.
-Hey.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.744
Isn't that right, Mr. Gladiator Exec?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.954
I just do what I can, sir.

10:21.038 --> 10:24.750
And listen, we really appreciate you
and Meg showing interest in Gladiator.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.212
Oh, nah, man. That's all Meg.
I don't-- I don't--

10:28.295 --> 10:30.172
I don't deal with that kind of shit.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.256
"Shit"?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.467
No. No disrespect.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.760
The hell with respect.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.930
You got young people out here
killing each other over sneakers,

10:38.013 --> 10:39.014
while you take it to the bank.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.474
-Yeah.
-Yeah. My man.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.018
What? So that's on me?

10:43.101 --> 10:46.104
What's the retail on those? 240, 250?

10:46.772 --> 10:48.565
You guys are aware
that your pediatricians

10:48.649 --> 10:50.400
make money off of your kids too.
Are they bad guys?

10:50.484 --> 10:51.777
Come on.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.487
-I mean, are they bad?
-That ain't the same.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.405
-I'm just askin' a question.
-Come on, Zo.

10:55.489 --> 10:59.535
Now, fortunately, my job allows me
to help kids all over the country.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.871
Right now, I have five teams
in five different cities.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.207
I'm able to provide them
with high-quality gear,

11:05.290 --> 11:07.835
tournament fees, travel expenses--

11:07.918 --> 11:12.047
Brother, brother.
You just a suit in fancy street clothes

11:12.130 --> 11:14.675
pimping kids to profit a corporation.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.635
-Am I right though? Am I right?
-I'm a suit now?

11:16.718 --> 11:17.719
-Hold on.
-I'm a suit?

11:17.803 --> 11:20.681
Now, white kids across town,
they get sponsored equipment

11:20.764 --> 11:23.350
for they golf and they tennis teams
all the time.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.102
-Yeah.
-Black kids get sponsorship,

11:25.185 --> 11:26.311
it's a criminal offense.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.980
-It's true.
-Thank you.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.774
Sometimes, it is a criminal offense.

11:30.858 --> 11:31.859
Thank you.

11:31.942 --> 11:32.943
Good point.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.488
Now, everybody uses someone in our game.

11:36.572 --> 11:40.200
The question is, are y'all misusin' 'em?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.161
Yeah.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.539
Well, I guess that question
could be thrown at the coaches too.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.458
That's true. That's true.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.170
And I know you don't deal
with this "shit,"

11:52.045 --> 11:54.173
but I'm sorry we couldn't
back Swagger this time.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.674
We're goin' with the Dominion Ballers.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.887
-That kid Nick Mendez? He's the truth.
-Nick Mendez?

11:59.970 --> 12:02.181
Listen, I know you guys beat them
last game, but…

12:03.015 --> 12:04.725
that boy is box office.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.144
Kinda like you when you were on top.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.105
-No disrespect.
-Cold.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.024
Seem like you got everything figured out.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.359
I always gotta be one step
ahead of the game, man.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.111
You know that.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.238
-Good luck on the rest of your season.
-Thank you.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.365
Sir, enjoy those sneakers, man.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.742
-Thank you.
-No problem.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.373
Yo, sorry for the trouble, Ike.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.458
All right, y'all.

12:40.802 --> 12:41.845
Hey.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.639
Nothing's changed with Nick, right?

12:43.722 --> 12:44.806
Right. Why?

12:46.642 --> 12:49.353
Just checkin'.
I'll tell you how it goes with Jenna.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.063
All right, bye.

13:05.994 --> 13:06.995
Hey, Dad.

13:07.079 --> 13:09.915
Hey. I've been tryin' to reach you.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.334
I noticed. What's up?

13:13.418 --> 13:15.003
I need to see you tomorrow.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.090
Kinda busy, Dad.

13:19.758 --> 13:20.926
It's important.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.387
You remember our old spot?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.055
Yeah, I guess.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.307
Can you meet me there
tomorrow, two o'clock?

13:29.518 --> 13:30.519
Fine.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.407
So, Phil, what line of work
are your parents in?

13:43.490 --> 13:46.118
-Warren.
-What? It's a normal question.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.580
My pops is a security guard, and…

13:49.663 --> 13:50.747
And his mom's a nurse.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.045
Yeah. She's-- She's taking a break
right now, but she'll be back soon.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.047
Do you live close to the rec center?

13:59.131 --> 14:00.716
Yeah, it's just a quick walk.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.759
How nice is that?
He can actually walk to practice.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.386
Here we go!

14:04.469 --> 14:06.555
There are four gyms in our neighborhood.
Four.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.098
-And all four of them…
-Four?

14:08.182 --> 14:09.933
…are breeding grounds for scrubs.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.853
Drew Murphy don't mess with scrubs.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.230
I think it's good he plays across town.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.773
He doesn't mind the commute, and besides,

14:16.857 --> 14:18.525
it's cool
how these boys are so color-blind.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.074
Seriously, Dad?
They're Black, and I'm white.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.117
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, baby.

15:09.201 --> 15:12.079
You need to get home and get on your
chores before we go to Ike's house.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.498
Okay. I'll be home in like 30 minutes.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.959
No, you'll be home right now.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.627
Okay.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.921
Sorry.

15:22.047 --> 15:25.884
I gotta go too. My parents been
buggin' me and blowin' my phone up.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.427
I'll walk you.

15:27.511 --> 15:28.971
Jace, I'm three blocks away.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.347
I don't care.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.858
-You're late. Are you okay?
-You're supposed to text us from the bus.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.819
Don't you walk away. Hey!

15:43.902 --> 15:45.988
-What?
-You can't just ignore us.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.614
-I'm not ignoring you.
-Hey, hey. Calm down.

15:47.698 --> 15:50.868
-What is wrong with you lately?
-My phone died! Get off my back!

15:50.951 --> 15:52.661
-Wha--
-Damn.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.086
What's goin' on with you?
First, your grades.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.548
Now you're comin' home late.
Talkin' back to your mom?

16:05.174 --> 16:08.177
Hey, listen. I know you lost your last
game, and I know how you get.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.013
But you need to fix this. You got me?

16:14.099 --> 16:15.142
Clean your room up.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.307
-This oxtail is perfect.
-Thank you.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.267
Jace.

17:06.359 --> 17:10.364
So, I wanted y'all here tonight
to discuss something.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.241
Is there a problem?

17:12.324 --> 17:13.867
No. It's a good thing.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.868
It's a great thing, actually.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.037
Swagger just got better.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.415
We got a new player that'll be
a great complement to Jace.

17:21.500 --> 17:26.003
Oh, so you are bringin' on Nick Mendez.
You told me there's nothin' to tell.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.131
At the time it wasn't. But I--

17:28.214 --> 17:31.927
Okay. So what's your big game plan, Ike?
Do you have one?

17:34.805 --> 17:37.808
The offense will focus more
on balance and ball movement.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.352
So you want Jace to have the ball
in his hands less?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.063
-No.
-Then what?

17:45.148 --> 17:47.276
Okay. Check it out.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.198
When our offense stagnates,

17:53.282 --> 17:57.536
Jace is forced to create his own shot
with a defense that's expecting it.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.037
But now…

18:01.707 --> 18:05.752
As the ball moves with a scorer
on the other side, Nick,

18:05.836 --> 18:08.505
the defense is no longer able to double
or triple-team him anymore.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.717
Why can't Jace bring the ball up?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.261
He can. The positions are interchangeable.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.056
It'll work as long as everyone buys in.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.392
Why should he buy in?

18:20.475 --> 18:25.022
Bottom line, this frees up more efficient
opportunities for Jace to get his shine.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.069
I don't know.

18:31.737 --> 18:32.779
What do you think?

18:35.699 --> 18:37.159
Why is Nick leaving the Ballers?

18:38.869 --> 18:41.371
-He had a problem with his coach.
-What kind of problem?

18:42.122 --> 18:44.458
The guy turned out to be
someone he couldn't trust.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.756
I'ma get the peach cobbler.
You finished, baby?

18:50.839 --> 18:51.840
Yeah.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.722
-Yo.
-Jenna, thank you.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.848
You got somethin' to say?

19:01.892 --> 19:03.352
Whatever's best for the team.

19:07.856 --> 19:12.945
So I saw a picture of you at Sawyer's.
Your father was your coach, right?

19:13.028 --> 19:15.697
Yeah, he coached me
all through high school.

19:15.781 --> 19:17.407
And how was that?

19:17.491 --> 19:20.702
The father-son, coach-player
is a interesting dynamic.

19:21.787 --> 19:23.163
But I learned a lot from him.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.499
Have they seen your tattoo?

19:25.582 --> 19:26.625
What?

19:26.708 --> 19:28.085
Don't be shy.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.843
"Twenty-four-hour person."

19:35.926 --> 19:37.845
Yeah, it was kind of my pops's thing.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.304
What does it mean?

19:42.057 --> 19:43.642
A 24-hour person…

19:44.810 --> 19:47.938
is not a person who says they'll be there
for you and not fight for you.

19:48.730 --> 19:53.610
It's not the leader that disappears
at a time of crisis.

19:55.279 --> 19:59.449
A 24-hour person is authentic,
consistent…

20:00.617 --> 20:02.286
24 hours a day.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.955
Someone you can count on.

20:05.831 --> 20:06.957
No matter what.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.630
If you are great,
then you are a great servant.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.717
But your wickedness has afflicted
your hearts.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.135
Compassion is dead.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.680
The end of the world is upon us.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.102
Get ready, brothers and sisters.

20:27.186 --> 20:29.688
If you are great,
then you are a great servant.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.691
Baby, don't forget
I'm gonna be home late tomorrow.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.152
Make sure you eat and take a shower
after practice.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.528
Where you goin' again?

20:37.362 --> 20:40.407
I'm just recruitin' a new consultant.
Shouldn't go too late.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.621
You sure you good with Nick
joining the team?

20:47.289 --> 20:48.290
Yeah.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.293
And you're still happy
playing for Coach Ike, right?

20:54.296 --> 20:57.883
I like what he said about 24-hour person.

20:59.343 --> 21:00.928
Yeah, that's a nice thought.

21:06.642 --> 21:08.977
Yo, are you playing chess?

21:10.938 --> 21:11.980
Are you nosy?

21:12.064 --> 21:14.608
Bro, you just play against random fools?

21:14.691 --> 21:16.527
Nah. Old girl from my school.

21:18.737 --> 21:20.948
Oh, did she just take your queen?

21:21.031 --> 21:22.533
How you gonna let her do you like that?

21:22.616 --> 21:23.659
It's a sacrifice.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.702
What?

21:25.786 --> 21:27.746
No, like, she thinks she's slick, right?

21:27.829 --> 21:32.042
But I let her take my queen
so I could do this.

21:33.627 --> 21:34.837
Oh, that's cold-blooded.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.131
Got ice in my veins, baby.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.800
Hey, she cute?

21:41.969 --> 21:42.970
She's aight.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.097
But… she a good chess player.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.645
Hey, you know you can stay at my crib,
like, even on school nights.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.982
Nah, I'm good, bro. Like, I don't wanna
have to wake up early as hell.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.734
I just can't do that, man.

21:58.569 --> 22:01.321
Nah, but like, for real.
You can stay whenever.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.032
No, I'm good, bro.

22:05.617 --> 22:06.702
Are you sure?

22:06.785 --> 22:09.121
Think we're a married couple or something?
Damn!

22:16.086 --> 22:18.130
Hey, I saw your bruises.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.675
Oh, those? I just--

22:22.509 --> 22:24.052
I caught a few elbows last game. You know?

22:27.764 --> 22:31.810
Well, whatever you need, we're fam.

22:35.606 --> 22:37.149
-For real.
-Yeah.

22:41.153 --> 22:42.696
Yes, have a good one.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.784
Thinking about dessert?

22:51.288 --> 22:52.289
Hey, Meg.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.373
Hi, Dad.

22:54.875 --> 22:57.711
They've got your favorite
on special today.

22:58.670 --> 22:59.880
You said it was important.

23:01.632 --> 23:02.716
Yeah.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.730
I always believed in serving my country.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.567
It felt like my purpose.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.278
It was so clear to me.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.573
And I never got a grasp on civilian life.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.243
Never knew what to do as a husband.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.203
I put your mom through so much.

23:33.038 --> 23:36.416
I mean, Mom's on a cruise
with her boyfriend.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.001
She's having the time of her life.

23:38.794 --> 23:40.879
I doubt she's holding her breath
for an apology.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.717
I wasn't there for you either.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.304
And I'm sorry, Meg.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.602
Is that it?

23:58.939 --> 24:00.023
The cancer's back.

24:01.525 --> 24:04.319
I beat it before.
I know I can beat it again.

24:04.403 --> 24:08.240
But in case you don't,
you wanted to clear your conscience.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.158
It's too late for my conscience.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.370
I just thought I should tell you.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.046
You never came to one of my games.

24:23.714 --> 24:24.756
I was coaching.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.134
Not one. Ever.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.514
I was a piece of shit.

24:35.392 --> 24:36.518
I gotta go.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.437
Wait. Wait. Please.

24:40.189 --> 24:41.982
For what it's worth, take these.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.235
These are the plays we ran at West Point.

24:45.819 --> 24:50.073
There are seven conference titles
and eight NCAA tournaments in these plays.

24:50.157 --> 24:52.701
Thirty-five years of coaching right here.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.079
I never got around to computerizing them,

24:56.163 --> 24:57.956
but if you're still doing
your basketball thing,

24:58.665 --> 25:00.125
this is all I got to give you.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.175
I am still doing my basketball thing,

25:09.134 --> 25:10.719
and I'm sorry about your cancer, Dad.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.490
-Funnel left.
-Thanks, man.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.784
Wait. As soon as he crosses, you come.

25:33.867 --> 25:37.663
Two more defenders. Deny. Deny.
You deny this. Don't let reversal…

25:37.746 --> 25:39.289
That's the guy from Gladiator.

25:39.373 --> 25:41.458
Think we're gonna get some
of those new Gladiator lows?

25:41.542 --> 25:44.086
I'm trying to get one of them
jackets with striped sleeves.

25:44.169 --> 25:48.173
Yo, Alonzo. Yo.
Wasn't expecting you to come through.

25:48.257 --> 25:52.219
You know, when I get a chance to play
Santa, I like Christmas to be a surprise.

25:52.302 --> 25:54.304
Fellas, what you think about this, huh?

25:54.388 --> 25:56.682
-Yo, that's what I'm talking about.
-You like that?

25:56.765 --> 25:58.642
Hey, this is an after-practice thing.
All right?

25:58.725 --> 26:00.853
Make sure you thank him
before he rolls out of here.

26:00.936 --> 26:03.272
You could thank me too, Coach.

26:03.355 --> 26:05.232
You like that? What you think?
You like that?

26:05.315 --> 26:08.443
Thank you very much. Look at that.

26:10.112 --> 26:11.989
Hey, let me talk to you outside,
all right?

26:12.072 --> 26:14.658
'Cause you know, they can't focus
with you and all this gear here.

26:14.741 --> 26:17.995
Of course. Of course.
Just one more for the boy.

26:22.541 --> 26:23.542
Wait, where's Nick?

26:24.459 --> 26:27.254
All right, Coach, take 'em through it.
Let's go. We go hard. We go hard.

26:27.337 --> 26:28.881
-Let's go. Come on! Let's go!
-Let's go.

26:30.048 --> 26:31.592
Left side first.

26:32.676 --> 26:33.677
There you go.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.387
Get that rebound.

26:35.971 --> 26:40.142
I don't care about any new players.
I made a deal for Nick Mendez.

26:40.225 --> 26:43.061
No, no, no, no. You made a deal
for the Dominion Ballers.

26:43.729 --> 26:46.732
And guess what? I am the Dominion Ballers.

26:50.569 --> 26:52.905
Bobby, you know I can make your life
really hard, right?

26:54.406 --> 26:56.241
Because as far as you're concerned,

26:56.325 --> 26:57.534
I am Gladiator.

27:01.330 --> 27:03.457
Call Nick's mom. Now.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.765
Yo, I can't talk.

27:20.557 --> 27:23.060
-Why not?
-My parents are on me.

27:23.143 --> 27:25.312
Well, what time do you want
to meet tomorrow?

27:25.395 --> 27:28.607
I can't. I have to do this paper,
and then I have practice.

27:29.316 --> 27:31.276
Practice? What are you talking about?

27:31.360 --> 27:32.819
I'm going.

27:32.903 --> 27:35.489
Are you crazy? You can't go.

27:35.572 --> 27:37.032
I can't keep skipping.

27:37.741 --> 27:39.785
If I do, my parents'll find out,
and then what?

27:39.868 --> 27:41.954
I think you should tell your parents
anyway.

27:42.037 --> 27:43.121
No, Jace.

27:43.205 --> 27:45.207
-Then I will.
-No, you won't.

27:45.290 --> 27:46.583
What is going on?

27:47.709 --> 27:49.419
Jace is just helping me with my paper.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.215
No phone until the paper is done.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.466
Bye, Jace.

28:27.624 --> 28:28.625
Okay.

28:29.626 --> 28:32.045
Okay, Mimo. Call me as soon as you hear.

28:32.129 --> 28:33.463
Gotta make more shots.

28:33.547 --> 28:35.132
Assalamu Alaikum.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.053
Yo, everything all right?

28:40.137 --> 28:42.181
My father-in-law was rushed
to the hospital.

28:42.264 --> 28:43.515
He's having trouble breathing.

28:44.141 --> 28:48.437
Damn. If you--
if you need to take time off, y--

28:48.520 --> 28:50.230
-No. Nah. He's out in Cali.
-Okay.

28:50.314 --> 28:53.859
Aminah's staying in touch with her mom,
so right now,

28:53.942 --> 28:56.737
just… prayers in effect.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.447
Yeah, man. For sure.

29:05.871 --> 29:06.872
Yo.

29:08.165 --> 29:10.918
-Man, good lookin' out last game.
-What are you talking about?

29:11.793 --> 29:13.170
You had my back, man.

29:14.296 --> 29:15.464
I appreciate you.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.764
Sup, Coach?

29:23.847 --> 29:24.890
Hanging out, brother?

29:24.973 --> 29:26.183
Good.

29:26.266 --> 29:28.185
We-- We got something for you.

29:30.437 --> 29:31.855
Twenty-one.

29:56.129 --> 29:57.464
Over here. Over here.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.050
Hey, where was you at practice yesterday?

30:00.133 --> 30:03.136
-I had a doctor's appointment.
-You're lucky. Coach was on one.

30:03.220 --> 30:04.388
Oh, yeah?

30:04.471 --> 30:05.472
Bro.

30:14.815 --> 30:16.149
Baseline, ladies.

30:17.234 --> 30:18.694
Three minutes around the cones.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.489
Hustle up!

30:26.285 --> 30:27.286
Go!

30:32.666 --> 30:34.168
Come on. Let's step it up.

30:35.169 --> 30:36.295
Step it up!

30:42.634 --> 30:44.136
Give me some hustle.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.413
Y'all must wanna do this again!

31:21.715 --> 31:22.925
You okay, sweetie?

31:34.978 --> 31:37.397
Let's call your parents.
Have 'em come pick you up, okay?

31:41.068 --> 31:43.028
Today's about mental toughness, ladies.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.364
I didn't say, "Stop running." Let's go!

31:45.948 --> 31:49.243
As you can see, we have a new teammate.

31:50.327 --> 31:54.331
I for one am happy to not have to
go to war against this dude anymore.

31:54.414 --> 31:58.001
Officially welcome Nick Mendez to Swagger.

32:04.258 --> 32:05.717
Hey, yo, welcome to the team, Nick.

32:07.177 --> 32:10.430
Way to go, Royale.
You won't be running sprints today.

32:11.181 --> 32:14.893
I'm sure Nick will go just as hard for us,
if not harder,

32:14.977 --> 32:18.272
with having better teammates
right here at Swagger.

32:59.271 --> 33:02.691
Everybody got it? All right. Execute.

33:02.774 --> 33:05.319
Five passes, hit the cutter.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.579
-One-three, come on!
-One.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.080
-Call it out!
-I'm second.

33:17.164 --> 33:18.540
-Two.
-Hey, right here.

33:18.624 --> 33:20.250
Three. Four.

33:20.334 --> 33:21.960
-Hit him. Hit him.
-Ball, ball.

33:22.044 --> 33:23.504
Hit Nick!

33:26.757 --> 33:28.550
Jace, what was that?

33:28.634 --> 33:30.385
Thought you said four passes.

33:31.386 --> 33:32.763
Let me be clear.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.308
I want Jace to catch the ball

33:36.391 --> 33:39.561
off of Musa's pass
and hit Nick in the corner.

33:43.565 --> 33:44.858
Let's get it.

33:47.903 --> 33:49.780
-Right here.
-Hey, give me a screen.

33:49.863 --> 33:51.865
-One.
-Hey!

33:51.949 --> 33:53.283
-Two.
-Come on!

33:53.367 --> 33:55.202
Three. Four.

33:55.285 --> 33:56.495
Hit him.

33:57.287 --> 33:59.456
-Jace!
-You crazy puta!

33:59.540 --> 34:01.375
Yo, yo, yo. Drop it.

34:02.709 --> 34:06.255
-I ain't playing with you.
-What are you doing? Come on, man.

34:06.338 --> 34:08.549
What? You told me to pass him the ball,
so I passed him the ball.

34:11.760 --> 34:14.221
Pool. Now.

34:17.850 --> 34:18.891
Pool!

34:31.029 --> 34:32.697
Yo. What's good?

34:33.407 --> 34:34.658
Jace.

34:34.741 --> 34:38.871
I can't, bro.
I'm so tight right now, I just can't.

34:38.954 --> 34:40.205
Can't what?

34:41.290 --> 34:42.916
Someone's hurting a friend of mine.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.085
They don't even want my help.

34:46.837 --> 34:48.505
And I don't even know what to do.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.550
Doesn't want your help,
there's probably good reason.

34:51.632 --> 34:52.926
There is no good reason.

34:54.011 --> 34:56.638
-Doesn't make any sense.
-Maybe not to you.

34:56.722 --> 34:58.390
Man, you don't understand.

34:59.433 --> 35:00.601
Just forget it.

35:01.143 --> 35:02.978
Maybe your friend thinks there's no point,

35:04.479 --> 35:06.690
'cause at the end of the day,
he's trapped.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.735
There's no way out, and he knows it.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.329
This is ridiculous, man.

35:26.210 --> 35:27.503
-Nope.
-What?

35:27.586 --> 35:29.379
Come on. You're over here.
You get to watch.

35:29.463 --> 35:30.672
-Nah, but--
-Hey.

35:31.507 --> 35:32.716
Who's talking right now?

35:34.218 --> 35:38.347
Get over there, sit your ass down,
and think about who you are.

35:57.157 --> 35:58.158
Pick your feet up.

36:28.105 --> 36:29.565
Absolutely not.

36:29.648 --> 36:33.735
And this one wanted me to sign over
my parental rights.

36:34.403 --> 36:35.571
No.

36:37.114 --> 36:39.408
Well, I-I can promise you that…

36:40.576 --> 36:42.411
every decision will be yours to make.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.498
Okay? I wanna make your son
my number one priority.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.961
Yo, Nick. How you doing, buddy?

36:58.010 --> 37:01.471
Nick. Alonzo Powers, Gladiator.
We met a couple days ago.

37:01.555 --> 37:04.057
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Please.

37:09.563 --> 37:11.148
We're just talking to your mom,

37:11.231 --> 37:13.817
telling her how sorry we are about
how everything went down.

37:14.526 --> 37:18.322
I mean, as you know, Gladiator is now
sponsoring the Dominion Ballers.

37:18.405 --> 37:21.408
On a sponsored team,
you have more opportunity to play

37:21.491 --> 37:23.744
against the best players in the country.

37:24.411 --> 37:27.080
I mean, we can even start
by finding him the perfect high school.

37:27.164 --> 37:29.541
-Ju-- a good syst--
-We have already heard this before.

37:30.876 --> 37:33.587
Well, I also have a lot of contacts
and former teammates

37:33.670 --> 37:35.047
that are now college coaches.

37:35.130 --> 37:37.841
College. He's 14.

37:37.925 --> 37:41.428
Believe it or not,
kids this young with his talent,

37:41.512 --> 37:43.263
they're already on their radar.

37:43.347 --> 37:45.641
So we can really start to think long-term.

37:47.184 --> 37:48.310
Nick.

37:49.686 --> 37:53.941
I'm gonna make you a promise
that it's going to be my personal mission

37:54.024 --> 37:57.361
to make sure I put you
in every position for success.

37:58.904 --> 38:01.657
But listen, I-I don't--
I don't wanna sell you, okay?

38:01.740 --> 38:03.867
This isn't about me. Okay?

38:03.951 --> 38:08.372
This isn't about Coach Bobby.
This is about you. All right?

38:08.455 --> 38:09.831
And what you want to do.

38:10.707 --> 38:13.961
Whoever you decide to play for,
wherever you decide to go,

38:14.962 --> 38:16.171
I'm rooting for you, kid.

38:16.255 --> 38:17.631
200%.

38:19.174 --> 38:21.385
I'm gonna make sure you have
my number before I leave,

38:21.468 --> 38:24.096
so you can call me at any time
for anything.

38:24.763 --> 38:27.933
Because at the end of the day,
there's nothing that'll make me happier

38:28.016 --> 38:30.185
than to see you take this
all the way to the top.

38:30.853 --> 38:32.187
You're that talented, kid.

38:35.399 --> 38:36.942
Come home, Nick.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.695
You belong with us.

38:42.114 --> 38:44.658
Hey. We got Swagger coming up.

38:44.741 --> 38:47.327
And you know
how we're gonna bring it, right?

38:47.744 --> 38:48.745
Right, it would just--

38:48.829 --> 38:50.998
it would be wrong to see you
on the losing side.

38:55.252 --> 38:56.253
Wait.

38:57.087 --> 38:58.839
Are you saying I can't beat you?

38:59.548 --> 39:02.426
What?
Nick, no, that's not what I meant at all.

39:02.509 --> 39:05.846
No, that's--
No, he-he-- It was just worded wrong.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.055
That's not what he--

39:39.296 --> 39:40.339
I need your help.

39:41.673 --> 39:43.425
I need to jack somebody up.

39:43.509 --> 39:44.635
You mean Nick.

39:44.718 --> 39:46.678
-Not Nick.
-Who?

39:47.262 --> 39:48.388
Can't tell you who.

39:49.473 --> 39:50.724
Can't tell you why.

39:52.142 --> 39:53.268
I just need your help.

39:59.650 --> 40:00.651
I got you.

40:04.905 --> 40:07.032
All right. I'm down.

40:08.450 --> 40:09.451
All right.

40:11.828 --> 40:12.829
All right.

40:14.915 --> 40:15.916
Me too.

40:18.293 --> 40:19.628
Come on, let's go.

40:19.711 --> 40:21.004
Come on.

40:34.852 --> 40:36.019
-Yo, Pops.
-Hey.

40:36.103 --> 40:38.355
Is it cool if I stay at Jace's
for like an hour?

40:38.438 --> 40:40.440
I hope y'all gonna talk about
fixing your attitudes.

40:40.524 --> 40:42.067
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah. You guys need a ride?

40:43.443 --> 40:46.113
No. No. We good. I think we can walk.

40:46.196 --> 40:48.323
Okay. All right.

40:48.407 --> 40:50.117
-Thank you, Coach.
-Yep.

40:52.494 --> 40:53.495
Yeah. Hi, Mom.

40:54.162 --> 40:56.498
Practice is going a little long
tonight, so I'll be in late.

40:56.582 --> 40:58.333
Yeah, no, I'll order a Lyft.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.420
All right. Love you. Bye.

41:10.762 --> 41:13.098
This is a nice place.

41:13.182 --> 41:14.975
-Well, I'm glad you like it.
-Thank you.

41:15.058 --> 41:17.728
-It's one of my new favorite spots.
-Oh, nice.

41:18.854 --> 41:20.564
What made you call me?

41:21.732 --> 41:23.734
Well, I think about you now and then.

41:24.526 --> 41:26.069
Finally got the nerve to reach out.

41:28.071 --> 41:31.950
And how's Bridgette and your… two boys?

41:32.034 --> 41:34.161
One boy. Freshman at Morehouse.

41:34.244 --> 41:36.163
Okay.

41:36.246 --> 41:38.874
Bridgette and I are divorced.
Going on five years.

41:40.209 --> 41:41.251
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:42.377 --> 41:43.587
I'm not.

41:44.505 --> 41:45.964
I'm just messing with you.

41:48.217 --> 41:51.512
Look, we're good. Cordial.
And you and Grant?

41:51.595 --> 41:52.804
You two still--

41:52.888 --> 41:55.015
Please. Not for a long-ass time.

41:55.098 --> 41:57.309
-It's like that, huh?
-It's like that.

42:00.771 --> 42:03.815
I remember you wanted to be a dentist.

42:04.358 --> 42:05.859
You're a real estate agent now?

42:05.943 --> 42:07.027
How'd you know that?

42:07.110 --> 42:08.237
Did you google me?

42:08.320 --> 42:10.280
Yeah. Yeah. You googled me.

42:10.364 --> 42:12.908
-Yes, I did.
-I know you did.

42:12.991 --> 42:15.953
I mean, I'm-- I--
I'm actually looking to move.

42:16.036 --> 42:17.746
-Really?
-Yeah.

42:17.829 --> 42:20.290
I've been selling cosmetics
as a side hustle.

42:20.374 --> 42:22.835
Save up for a nicer place.

42:22.918 --> 42:26.505
Yeah, I can't be worrying
every time my kids walk out the door.

42:26.588 --> 42:27.840
Yeah.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.592
Just need a place where we can breathe.

42:31.552 --> 42:32.803
Somewhere safe.

42:34.304 --> 42:35.389
No, I get it.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.559
Sorry.

42:44.731 --> 42:46.942
-I'm sorry about that.
-Nah, no problem.

42:47.025 --> 42:49.945
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, it was just-- it was my son.

42:50.028 --> 42:51.446
He's just checking in.

42:51.530 --> 42:53.282
Sounds like a good kid.

42:53.866 --> 42:55.200
Yeah, he is.

42:55.909 --> 42:56.952
That's good.

43:15.888 --> 43:17.264
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

43:37.075 --> 43:39.912
No. No. You're going too far.
You're gonna kill him.

43:39.995 --> 43:41.163
Go! Go!

43:41.246 --> 43:42.497
Come on!

43:43.081 --> 43:44.708
-Help me out.
-Let's go. Let's go.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.418
Let's go. Let's go.

43:46.502 --> 43:48.295
-Come on, man.
-Go. Let's go.

43:48.921 --> 43:50.547
Let's go. Let's go.
