00:00.967 --> 00:02.935
<i>Previously on</i> legends...

00:02.937 --> 00:05.204
There you are, mccombs,
and there's me.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.106
Where was this photo taken?
Someplace in iraq.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.774
I was never there.
Yes, you were.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.275
There you are, man.
Right there.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.277
And it's time-stamped 2004.

00:12.279 --> 00:15.381
February 2004, where was I?
Sonya: You don't remember?

00:15.383 --> 00:17.383
You had your car accident.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.817
How was that?

00:18.819 --> 00:20.285
You can't remember,
I can't remember,

00:20.287 --> 00:21.520
Mccombs couldn't remember.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.122
Martin:
<i>Mccombs is dead now.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:25.691
There had to be a reason
why someone wanted him dead.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.693
This guy knows what happened
to us over there.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.361
<i>Found it in his iraq file,</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:31.563
Something called
"operation raining fire."

00:31.565 --> 00:33.532
Martin: <i>And where's he now?</i>
<i>Maggie:</i> <i>Houston.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:34.967
Chang:
<i>Dobson's a bad dude.</i>

00:34.969 --> 00:36.835
Hey. What'd you
say your name was?

00:36.837 --> 00:39.038
Len barlow.
I want answers.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.272
Move! Get in!

00:47.547 --> 00:50.449
(horn honking)

00:59.759 --> 01:03.529
(groaning)

01:03.531 --> 01:05.064
We've got to go.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.565
Get up.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.401
I got shot... I got shot.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.670
They tried to get
you, and they got me.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.773
Get up.
To hell with you!

01:14.775 --> 01:15.841
I'm shot!

01:15.843 --> 01:16.942
Get up.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.947
Put pressure on the wound.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.870
(line ringing)

01:44.872 --> 01:46.371
Hey, it's campbell.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.640
I need to speak with the chief.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.375
Man:
Go ahead, cowboy.
The line's secure.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.644
The situation is priority delta.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.645
Someone took dobson.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.047
I don't know who the hell he is,

01:55.049 --> 01:56.748
But he took out all my men.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.951
We need immediate exfil
and containment.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.419
We have operatives searching
the area.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.788
They're headed east
from my position.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.457
I need a hospital,
damn it!

02:05.459 --> 02:07.226
Where are you taking me?

02:07.228 --> 02:08.760
You need a hospital,

02:08.762 --> 02:10.162
I want some answers.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.530
I need a sec,
I've got to stop.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.168
(over radio):
We're in the area
of jackson and fourth.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.237
No visual on target.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.874
Well, that's not good.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.032
Hey, I'm sorry, baby.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.500
Yeah, I know, I know.

02:48.502 --> 02:52.204
No, I don't know what time
we're gonna be finished.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.305
Yeah.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.007
Come on, if I was done,
I'd be home.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.542
What?

02:56.544 --> 02:59.344
No.
No.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.847
Look, it's just gonna
be a couple more hours.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.515
Hello?

03:03.517 --> 03:04.583
(sighs)

03:05.818 --> 03:07.786
Hmm.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.926
Sorry about that.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.730
Is everything okay?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.265
You ever been married?

03:22.969 --> 03:25.804
Briefly... A long time ago.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.974
Cured you for good, huh?

03:28.976 --> 03:32.511
Dco is a round-the-clock gig.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.047
It's not kind to marriage.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.782
You know, gates is
on his third ex-wife.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.152
You got anything?

03:40.154 --> 03:41.853
I don't know, this is...

03:41.855 --> 03:43.989
Some kind of journal
that evans kept.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.392
Read that.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.694
"I wake up under my bed.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.028
"don't know how I got there.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.263
"they want to kill me.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.731
I'm living a nightmare."

03:52.733 --> 03:54.566
(sighs)
it doesn't mention
who "they" are.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.735
Yeah, mccombs says something
similar on that hospital video.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.904
What happened to these guys?
I don't know.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.706
Could be a coincidence.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.908
What about odum?
He ever mention this stuff?

04:02.910 --> 04:05.210
No, I mean, he's trained
to cover his emotions.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.445
He's a closed book.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.514
And I'm almost positive
he never mentioned iraq.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.783
Ptsd. Paranoia.

04:11.785 --> 04:15.921
You know guys like that can't
keep a lid on it forever, right?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.256
Sooner or later,
their pot's gonna boil over.

04:17.258 --> 04:20.359
Yeah, and he keeps going under,
into legend.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.827
You know, it's like he's hiding.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.598
Here's everything I could find
on mccombs and evans in iraq.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.200
This is it?
Yeah.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.702
"operation raining fire."

04:30.704 --> 04:33.438
"raining fire"? Wait, that's
what mccombs was ranting about.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.440
This can't be
a coincidence.
I mean, everything in the file

04:35.442 --> 04:36.942
Has been redacted.
That file code

04:36.944 --> 04:38.710
Is for the highest
level clearance.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.812
We're talking, like,
five people--

04:40.814 --> 04:42.314
And one of them is not
the president.

04:42.316 --> 04:46.118
Beyond that, there's nothing
on record from 2003 to 2005.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.953
It's all scrubbed.
It's like

04:47.955 --> 04:50.155
Two years of their lives
were erased.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.757
Yeah, someone's gone
through a lot of trouble

04:51.759 --> 04:52.891
To make all that disappear.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.927
Yeah.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.296
Chief.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.297
This is agent...

04:58.299 --> 04:59.765
Rice. I know
who he is.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.067
What brings you back up
to the dco, agent rice?

05:02.069 --> 05:05.470
Sir, I've requested his help
on a developing case.
Case concerning what?

05:05.472 --> 05:06.605
Two homicides.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.806
It looks like they were
professional hits.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.908
And why is that
a concern of dco?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.543
Because martin is
in the middle of it.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.648
You and I, we will discuss this
in a moment--

05:16.650 --> 05:20.085
After I speak
with agent rice alone.

05:20.087 --> 05:24.022
Sir, martin was put on leave,
and then he disappeared.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.558
I believe that he's gone rogue,
under a legend named len barlow.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.999
You. My office. Now.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.137
You said you recognized me.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.172
From where?

05:40.174 --> 05:41.440
I don't know.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.841
I know your face.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.210
I don't remember where,
but I know when.

05:45.212 --> 05:48.213
Would've been
February 2004. In iraq.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.682
I don't know. I was
all over the country...

05:50.684 --> 05:52.451
Basra, maybe. Okay?

05:52.453 --> 05:53.852
Basra. Doing what?

05:53.854 --> 05:54.953
I worked an oil rig.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.121
Yeah, for who?

05:56.123 --> 05:57.522
What was the
company name?

05:57.524 --> 05:58.523
Who do <i>you</i> work for?

05:58.525 --> 05:59.524
Look, answer the question

05:59.526 --> 06:00.792
Or I'll get you
in that ditch!

06:00.794 --> 06:02.694
You hear me?
Okay, okay.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.029
Okay.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.198
You get me to a hospital,
I'll tell you everything.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.199
All right, move.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.736
I'll get you to a hospital.
On a bus?!

06:10.738 --> 06:11.870
Are you kidding me?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.105
You'd rather walk?

06:16.175 --> 06:17.843
Hey, that man needs
an ambulance.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.044
Yeah, that's <i>you,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

06:19.046 --> 06:20.545
I'm an fbi agent,
I'm commandeering this bus.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.546
He's lying!

06:21.548 --> 06:22.981
Sit down, shut up.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.015
He shot me!

06:24.017 --> 06:25.917
I need a hospital!
Come on, in the back.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.185
Plenty of room in the back.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.054
(groans)

06:29.056 --> 06:31.723
Is there a doctor on here,
huh, nurse?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.358
This man's losing
a lot of blood.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.227
Dobson:
Damn it, I need a hospital!

06:35.229 --> 06:36.595
You got some I.D.?
I'm working undercover.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.662
Hey, why don't you
step off the bus?

06:37.664 --> 06:38.730
I'll take this man

06:38.732 --> 06:39.731
To the hospital myself.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.999
He's my prisoner.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.234
He's not leaving
my sight.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.468
Now drive.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.676
I thought we had
an understanding.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.578
By understanding,
you mean...

06:53.580 --> 06:55.680
The time you came to my
house and threatened me?

06:55.682 --> 06:56.681
That is cute.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.016
You think that was a threat.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.885
Call it what you want.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.219
Let's cut to it.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.255
You got evidence that ties
martin odum to the murder?

07:03.257 --> 07:04.456
Well, that case has developed.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.858
I no longer believe
that odum killed mccombs.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.261
I must have missed your apology.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.462
(laughs)

07:13.266 --> 07:17.436
I... Apologize if...
There was any misunderstandings.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.304
I was only following
the facts that I had.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.439
But we now have a second victim,

07:20.441 --> 07:22.741
And I don't believe
that odum is a suspect,

07:22.743 --> 07:24.376
But he's right
in the middle of it.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.378
Uh, that remains to be seen.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.313
Why do I get feeling you don't
want me digging into this?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.548
Look, I'm protecting my agent.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.916
And I don't know you.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.117
I don't know your agenda.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.618
I don't know your angle.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.120
I don't trust you.
And    <i>trust</i>

07:35.122 --> 07:36.388
Is everything
in this department.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.956
Well, there is no agenda.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.224
There is no angle.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.459
Just the truth.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.928
The truth?
And the truth

07:42.930 --> 07:44.162
Is that odum is involved

07:44.164 --> 07:45.430
In something that's already
killed two people.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.799
Your agent is in
some serious trouble.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.968
Now, you don't trust me,
you don't know me-- I get that.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.470
But I'm bureau,
just like he is.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.438
I want to help him.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.673
He's in the wind.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.807
His phone is dark.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.842
Martin's on leave.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.477
I don't babysit.

07:58.479 --> 08:02.981
How can you... Protect...

08:02.983 --> 08:05.484
Your agent if you don't know
where he is?

08:05.486 --> 08:07.252
We've got two bodies.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.287
Pro murders.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.989
We can't waste any time.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.392
Don't get too comfortable here.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.602
Man (over radio):
Bus 41, this is dispatch.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.270
1073.
We see you are off your route.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.472
Please explain.
Over.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.341
Yeah, say you have
a medical situation.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.510
Dispatch, we have
a medical emergency.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.378
Guy's been shot, we're
en route to the hospital.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.846
Copy that, 41.
Hang up, keep driving.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.682
We will alert the hospital
that you are incoming.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.117
Take the next right.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.352
Run the red lights.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.220
Evans said
you'd know me.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.555
Remember evans?

08:43.557 --> 08:44.556
He was in iraq.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.557
Said I was in iraq.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.558
What was I doing there?

08:46.560 --> 08:47.692
I don't know.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.894
Come on, answer the question!

08:48.896 --> 08:50.028
What was I doing there?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.130
What's my name?
What's my name?!

08:52.132 --> 08:53.298
Call the cops.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.333
I'm telling you,
he's out of his mind.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.402
(siren wails)

08:57.404 --> 08:58.470
Man (over speaker):
Stop the bus!

08:58.472 --> 09:01.573
Open the side doors.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.542
Shit.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.709
Let's go.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.044
Come on,
come on, get up.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.145
Everybody put your hands
in the air.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.614
Martin:
I'm an fbi agent.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.051
I'm fbi.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.719
I'm unarmed!

09:14.721 --> 09:17.055
I've got a wounded man.
All right?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.690
I'm coming out.
Officer:
Set the wounded man

09:18.692 --> 09:20.392
Down on the ground.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.394
Martin:
He needs a hospital.

09:22.396 --> 09:26.565
Down on your knees,
and put your hands on your head.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.500
Get your hands on your head!
Yeah.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.235
Dispatch, this is five.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.404
We're 11-41 over
at the priority one call.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.538
Advise-- we have a code blue.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.940
Woman:
Emp eta, two.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.741
Ambulance is two minutes out,
sarge.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.810
Does he have I.D.?
Check his wallet.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.080
My name is martin odum--

09:42.082 --> 09:44.583
I'm a special agent
with the fbi.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.617
This man is a prisoner
in my custody.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.286
Leonard barlow, from midland.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.088
I'm working undercover.
Foxtrot-echo-zulu.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.356
Call my supervisor,

09:51.358 --> 09:54.593
Nelson gates, at the fbi office
in los angeles.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.761
Get the houston field office
on the line.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.097
Have them find
this fellow, gates.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.432
You're a cop?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.801
So that's why they
couldn't find you.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.775
(phone rings)

10:10.777 --> 10:11.776
This is gates.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.278
Yes, sir.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.580
This is sergeant sherman,
houston pd.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.949
I have a fellow here in custody,
says he's one of yours.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.119
His name is either
len barlow or martin odum.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.122
Correct, he's mine.
Uh, foxtrot-

10:24.124 --> 10:26.124
Echo-zulu.
Thank you, sir.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.959
Send verification of
his credentials and

10:27.961 --> 10:29.461
We'll release him.
Will do.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.062
May I speak
with agent odum, please?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.464
Yes, sir.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.336
It's your boss.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.572
Hello.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.307
How's vacation? Resting up?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.809
No, I've got something, nelson.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.012
Start with why
you're in houston.

10:47.014 --> 10:50.015
You were supposed
to take some personal time.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.850
Get your head together.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.652
I'm trying to help you here,
and you're running around

10:53.654 --> 10:55.186
Pulling this cowboy crap!

10:55.188 --> 10:57.656
You are wearing me out.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.858
You'd better have
an explanation.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.327
I have a suspect in custody.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.829
He's connected to the murder
of robert mccombs.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.032
Mccombs? The homeless guy?

11:07.034 --> 11:09.367
The one who said
you're not martin odum?

11:09.369 --> 11:12.003
Why the hell are you
dredging this up again?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.272
Look, you've known me
a long time, nelson.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.775
I need you to trust me
on this one.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.077
You trust me? Huh?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.180
Yes.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.216
I trust you.
My suspect's wounded.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.185
We're heading to the hospital.
I'll call you then.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.788
Martin. Watch yourself.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.592
Crystal, get in here.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.395
Was that martin?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.364
Grab a toothbrush.
You're heading to houston.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.865
Check in with
the field office.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.033
Martin will be waiting.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.468
He's in houston?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.637
I'll brief you en
route to the airport.

11:45.639 --> 11:48.406
Take rice. You two
seem to like working together.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.241
Martin get himself
in trouble again?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.043
Do I need to answer that?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.555
He's got a gunshot wound
to his right lower abdomen.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.056
Think the bullet's
still in.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.559
He's lost a lot of blood,
maybe two pints.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.060
What happened to you?

12:09.062 --> 12:11.062
Oh, uh... It's a car accident.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.564
It's a long story.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.466
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it all.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.236
Did you shoot this man?
No.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.405
Check the ballistics on his gun.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.073
Hey, I want it back
after you've done with it.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.242
Who shot him?
Sergeant, this is an active

12:24.244 --> 12:26.678
Federal investigation--
that information is classified.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.314
Classified.
I've got to go with him
to the hospital.

12:32.284 --> 12:35.253
We're clear.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.788
(engine starts)

12:36.790 --> 12:40.592
(siren wailing)

12:40.594 --> 12:42.594
Crystal:
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>

12:42.596 --> 12:45.096
Jet's fueled and ready to go.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.432
We have about a three-and-a-half
hour flight time to houston.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.769
So gates was cool
with me tagging along, huh?
I wouldn't say "cool."

12:50.771 --> 12:53.605
But I will be happy
to put this cloak and
dagger stuff to bed.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.974
I don't think it's gonna be
that easy. Odum is not the most

12:55.976 --> 12:58.309
Talkative person,
if you know what I mean.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.612
He doesn't have a choice.
So be honest with me.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.647
Do you think he lost it?
Mentally.

13:02.649 --> 13:05.884
Do you think somewhere along
the way the guy just cracked?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.720
I don't know.
I mean, evans

13:08.722 --> 13:11.389
And mccombs seemed crazy,
too, but... You know,

13:11.391 --> 13:13.458
I think they were killed
because they knew something.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.294
Yeah, but odum wasn't in iraq,
okay? As far as we know.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.963
He wasn't. Right?
And if that's the case, then

13:18.965 --> 13:20.532
What's the connection?

13:22.968 --> 13:25.637
(siren wailing)
bp's 70/45.
Hr's 115.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.806
All right, we're gonna get
some ivs going in you, sir.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.307
What's your blood type?

13:29.309 --> 13:30.975
A-neg.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.076
Why were they
looking for me?

13:32.078 --> 13:33.478
You really a brit?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.680
Or is that another act?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.315
What was my accent
when I met you?

13:37.317 --> 13:40.652
You don't remember who you are.
You can't remember

13:40.654 --> 13:42.921
Anything.
Hey,

13:42.923 --> 13:45.657
You're gonna
tell me.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.858
Paramedic:
Bp is dropping.
He's going to arrest.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.660
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

13:48.662 --> 13:49.928
Sir, can you hear me?

13:49.930 --> 13:51.162
Dobson!

13:51.164 --> 13:52.330
All right, I need you
to back off, sir.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.165
I'm inserting
two large-bore ivs,

13:54.167 --> 13:55.333
Couple of pressure bags.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.068
Circulating his pressure again.

13:58.270 --> 14:01.105
Call general.
Patient is not responding.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.607
Man:
Roger that.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.008
How much further?

14:04.010 --> 14:06.044
How much further is it?
Eta less than five.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.378
You don't let him die on me,
you hear?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.913
Doing my best.
You don't let him die on me!

14:14.220 --> 14:16.387
All right, let's get
a right femoral artery going.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.190
And start a transfusion,
four units.
Type a-neg.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.360
Pulse is dropping. Get a crash
cart in here! Ready for defib!

14:22.362 --> 14:24.028
Look, this man is
in federal custody.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.865
He's not going anywhere, sir.
Please wait outside.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.068
Standing by.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.205
All right, let's move it.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.041
Charging.
Clear!

14:39.378 --> 14:40.411
Still in defib.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.213
Charge again.
Charging.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.314
Clear!

14:44.550 --> 14:45.717
Got him.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.986
Pulse is thready, low 60s.

14:47.988 --> 14:51.055
All right, let's move him--
to the table.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.424
Martin:
I almost lost him,
but he's in surgery now.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.893
Are you safe at your location?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.561
Local pd have got
the place locked down.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.997
But I don't know--
I expect dobson's got backup.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
Okay, I'm putting
a communication net

15:01.001 --> 15:02.233
Over martin's location

15:02.235 --> 15:03.601
With keyword traps--
so if anybody's talking

15:03.603 --> 15:04.602
About this thing, we'll know.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.738
Martin, I need you to stay put.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.439
Crystal's en route to houston.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.341
Aw, you sent crystal
to bring me back.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.409
That's nice of you.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.077
(chuckles)
well...

15:13.079 --> 15:14.913
She's bringing a new friend
with her-- agent rice.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.581
Ah, okay. Not that nice.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.082
Martin, you have been cleared

15:18.084 --> 15:20.351
As a suspect
in the mccombs murder.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.020
But there's been
another killing.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.755
A friend of his, a dennis evans.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.923
What, they got evans?

15:24.925 --> 15:25.924
Who are "they"?

15:25.926 --> 15:27.191
Who got evans?

15:27.193 --> 15:28.626
Looks like you could use it.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.827
Thank you.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.630
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.766
Dobson was operating
out of a chop shop.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.867
Seemed like a cover.

15:35.869 --> 15:36.868
Cover for what?

15:36.870 --> 15:38.036
I don't know yet.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.304
Crystal and rice need
to get over here

15:39.306 --> 15:40.638
As soon as they can.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.940
It needs a little bit
of a clean-up.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.274
I had to shoot my way out.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.776
You're making me
nervous here, martin.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.210
Nelson,

15:46.212 --> 15:48.646
Dobson is connected
to something major.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.448
Illegal arms trades,
maybe supplying terrorists.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.449
I don't know.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.451
But when I was in the chop shop,

15:53.453 --> 15:55.887
<i>I saw a missile.</i>

15:55.889 --> 15:57.789
A missile?
Looked like a hellfire.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.891
You're not supposed to be here.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.793
<i>And I saw boxes</i>
<i>for several more.</i>

16:01.795 --> 16:03.761
They tried to cover it up,
but I caught a glance.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.831
Dobson worked for a private
contractor called verax

16:06.833 --> 16:08.132
When he was in iraq.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.134
Doesn't say what he did
for them.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.604
But mccombs and evans also
worked for that contractor.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.239
Look, something happened
to them in iraq.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.576
It was around February 2004.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.746
Nelson, I think I was there.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.414
I saw evidence.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.916
How is that
possible?

16:24.918 --> 16:27.652
In February 2004 you were
in a serious car accident

16:27.654 --> 16:30.188
That left you in a coma.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.790
Dobson says he remembers me
from iraq.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.427
Whatever happened over there,
he knows the truth.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.696
I'll ask him if he makes it
through surgery.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.006
Woman (over p.A.):
Hospital transport
to vascular imaging.

16:48.008 --> 16:51.342
Hospital transport to
vascular imaging.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.951
Infusing with dopamine--
two mcg.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.394
(phone ringing)

17:09.396 --> 17:11.763
Portable x ray to er2.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.883
Mccombs:
<i>You really think</i>
<i>you're martin odum?</i>

17:31.885 --> 17:33.718
<i>There is no martin odum.</i>

17:33.720 --> 17:34.886
<i>Everything about him is fake.</i>

17:34.888 --> 17:36.087
Evans:
<i>We all got the same thing.</i>

17:36.089 --> 17:37.989
<i>They did something to us</i>
<i>over there, man.</i>

17:37.991 --> 17:41.559
Sonya:
<i>I know your name.</i>
<i>It's martin macdonald odum.</i>

17:41.561 --> 17:42.593
Evans:
<i>I am telling you--</i>

17:42.595 --> 17:44.228
Don't trust anyone!

17:44.230 --> 17:47.565
Trust no one. Trust nothing.
Trust no one. No one.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.633
No one.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.308
Hello?

18:00.846 --> 18:01.913
Agent odum.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.882
Agent wilkins,
s.A.C. Houston.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.551
It seems you've had
quite a night.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.186
Yeah, where's dobson?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.887
He's upstairs, resting.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.456
No, I need to get up there...

18:11.458 --> 18:13.224
Wait, dobson's gonna be
just fine, agent odum.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.560
What I need you to do

18:15.562 --> 18:17.061
Is fill me in
on what you know

18:17.063 --> 18:18.396
About dobson's
operation.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.031
What I know?

18:20.033 --> 18:21.599
Chief gates assured me
that you would tell us

18:21.601 --> 18:22.767
Everything you knew
about this guy.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.904
Dco agents are en route.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.373
I'll speak to you
when they get here.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.976
I see.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.416
Kyle dobson-- what room?

18:38.418 --> 18:39.817
Just one second, sir.
I'm busy.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.085
Fbi. It's an emergency.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.087
Wait a minute.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.589
You're the one
who gave me the coffee.
Uh...

18:44.591 --> 18:45.923
It was drugged, wasn't it?

18:45.925 --> 18:47.825
Drugged?
What are you talking about?

18:51.430 --> 18:52.930
Move him now; he's approaching.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.165
Agent is in pursuit.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.503
(elevator bell dings)

18:58.505 --> 18:59.971
Hey, you, stop!

19:08.914 --> 19:11.816
Fbi agent odum can jeopardize
the mission.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.751
Sir, we'll take care of him.
Get me out of here.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.052
That's the plan, sir.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.393
(yells)

19:34.039 --> 19:35.506
Come on, honey,
I got you.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.047
Get in the car now.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.448
You're hurting me.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.228
(line rings)

19:57.230 --> 19:59.630
(phone rings)

19:59.632 --> 20:00.631
This is gates.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.166
I'm in trouble, nelson.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.801
Dobson's men were
at the hospital.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.403
You have dobson in custody?
Yeah, I got him,

20:05.405 --> 20:06.204
And I'm bringing him into dco.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.172
Houston's not safe anymore.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.173
I need help getting out of here.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.676
Um... Get to austin.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.912
Special agent james garrett
is a friend of mine.
You can trust him.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.714
I'll let him know
you're inbound.
I'm staying off the highways.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.182
Gonna take the back roads.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.517
We won't have a satellite
in position

20:19.519 --> 20:21.519
For another hour,
so keep in touch.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.554
Okay. Phone's almost dead.
I'll do my best.

20:29.528 --> 20:32.597
(groans, panting)

20:34.566 --> 20:36.867
Where
are we?

20:36.869 --> 20:39.403
Don't worry about it.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.072
How'd they find us
at the hospital?

20:41.074 --> 20:45.042
You don't think
we use the same toys you do?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.712
They were tracking my phone?

20:47.714 --> 20:50.581
That's not
dime store technology.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.417
You need access to
digital exchanges,

20:53.419 --> 20:56.554
Network grid,
state and federal okay.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.956
We have ways around that.
Yeah?
Who's "we"?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.391
Same people selling
that hellfire missile

21:00.393 --> 21:01.626
I saw in the shop?

21:01.628 --> 21:04.562
What are they
gonna use it for?

21:04.564 --> 21:08.399
Sorry. Above my, uh...
My pay grade.

21:08.401 --> 21:12.236
Answer the question,
you hear? Hmm?

21:12.238 --> 21:14.405
What are they gonna
use it for?
I'm wiped out.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.607
Answer the question.
You know,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.609
Just wake me when we get to...

21:18.611 --> 21:20.611
Wherever you're taking me.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.447
Listen, you shit!
You answer the question!

21:23.449 --> 21:25.983
(panting)

21:31.957 --> 21:33.924
Dobson:
<i>You really screwed yourself</i>
<i>this time. You know that,</i>

21:33.926 --> 21:35.326
Right?

21:35.328 --> 21:37.762
And you just might as well...

21:37.764 --> 21:39.930
Kiss your ass good-bye.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.600
(chuckles)
you know that their orders
are to recover me alive.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.602
They're not gonna
stop until they do.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.604
Which means
you have...

21:46.606 --> 21:50.441
Maybe... 24 hours to live.

21:50.443 --> 21:54.278
Yeah, when I get to that 25th
hour, the equation changes.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.114
Means the longer you hang
in the wind,

21:57.116 --> 21:59.984
The bigger a liability
you become to them.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.787
Forget rescue. It'll be
about damage control.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.656
That's not true.
Cold fact,

22:05.658 --> 22:09.193
In about 24 hours,
you're just as dead as I am.

22:24.142 --> 22:25.676
I need to talk to you
about something.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.878
Unless it can't wait.
It can't.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.017
Martin asked me to look
into dennis evans off-book.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.652
The same dennis evans
that's now lying in the morgue?

22:34.654 --> 22:36.654
The same.
And I also helped

22:36.656 --> 22:38.923
Martin set up
the len barlow legend.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.892
What'd you give him?

22:41.894 --> 22:43.027
Everything that I could find.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.831
Financials, work history,
current address.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.666
So martin was
at evans' residence?

22:48.668 --> 22:49.900
I don't know, sir.

22:53.004 --> 22:56.207
I was just trying to help, sir.

22:56.209 --> 23:00.010
You're smart enough to know
that that's not an excuse.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.413
This is going to
stay between us.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.915
Are we clear?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.852
Rice: <i>Thought we came to houston</i>
<i>to pick odum up.</i>

23:07.854 --> 23:09.520
Crystal: <i>He told gates</i>
<i>this place was being used</i>

23:09.522 --> 23:13.124
<i>For smuggling</i>
<i>military ordinance.</i>

23:15.193 --> 23:16.093
Ground's wet.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.528
Those look

23:17.530 --> 23:18.229
Like bloodstains to you?

23:18.231 --> 23:19.363
Hosed it down,

23:19.365 --> 23:20.331
Covered it up.

23:22.934 --> 23:26.237
Shell casing.
(sniffs)

23:26.239 --> 23:29.106
Fired recently.
They must've missed it
during the cleanup.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.380
It's locked.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.582
We're breaking in?
There are exigent circumstances.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.683
It's your lead.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.598
Martin said we were gonna
find some kind of arsenal.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.233
Yeah, well,
I don't see much of that

23:56.235 --> 23:57.468
Laying
around here.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.910
I'm calling
houston pd.

24:05.912 --> 24:06.911
Let's secure the scene,

24:06.913 --> 24:09.580
See what forensics gets.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.982
(toilet flushes)

24:11.984 --> 24:13.250
Fbi!

24:13.252 --> 24:15.252
Don't move.
Put your hands up!

24:15.254 --> 24:16.253
Put 'em up!

24:16.255 --> 24:17.488
Is there anyone else here?

24:17.490 --> 24:18.589
It's just me.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.157
I'm ray. This is my garage.

24:24.095 --> 24:26.130
Raymond campbell.

24:26.132 --> 24:26.997
That's right.
We're responding

24:26.999 --> 24:28.833
To a local 911 call--

24:28.835 --> 24:29.800
Possible
shots fired,

24:29.802 --> 24:31.302
Break-in.
Not here.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.103
I've been working
on that engine all night.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.839
Sometimes I keep the
radio up real loud,

24:34.841 --> 24:36.807
So I-I don't
hear nothing.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.276
Oh, damn. Y'all gave me
one hell of a scare.

24:39.278 --> 24:42.446
Who beat you up?
Oh, this? This ain't nothing.
Just a...

24:42.448 --> 24:44.648
Little fun
at the bar.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.817
He got the worst of it,
believe you me.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.118
What kind of engine is that?

24:48.120 --> 24:49.954
That there's a 350 short block.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.956
Came out of my truck.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.657
You know engines?

24:53.659 --> 24:54.859
Yeah, my uncle owned a garage.

25:00.832 --> 25:01.665
(gunshot)

25:01.667 --> 25:03.334
(gasps)

25:03.336 --> 25:04.635
(grunting)
you didn't
believe me, huh?

25:04.637 --> 25:07.304
Didn't believe me?

25:07.306 --> 25:08.472
Didn't feel like running?

25:08.474 --> 25:10.174
Pulled a hammy playing ball.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.343
(grunts)
there was military
ordinance here.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.011
A hellfire missile.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.045
Where is it?

25:15.047 --> 25:17.047
It's long gone, baby.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.416
You got nothing.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.152
Dobson:
<i>So where you taking me?</i>

25:22.154 --> 25:24.154
Somewhere safe.
Private.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.490
So you can answer
some questions.

25:26.492 --> 25:29.159
Torture?
That's where this is going?

25:29.161 --> 25:32.496
How our q&a goes is up to you.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.398
Who do you work for?

25:37.502 --> 25:40.871
We're the guys who don't exist,

25:40.873 --> 25:44.174
Doing the things
that didn't happen,

25:44.176 --> 25:47.778
Following the orders
that no one gave.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.182
How do you know me?

25:52.184 --> 25:54.151
Met you in iraq.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.086
And what was my name?

25:56.088 --> 25:58.489
What was I doing there?
I don't
know, buddy.

25:58.491 --> 26:01.859
You know, I must've missed your
name tag at the battle of basra

26:01.861 --> 26:03.260
Ice cream social.
Yeah.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.362
What was operation raining fire?

26:05.364 --> 26:07.097
It was a mess is what it was.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.502
My iv's out.

26:12.704 --> 26:15.039
I need antibiotics.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.274
What you get is up to you.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.243
You really don't remember
anything?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.545
You know, a lot
of the other guys came back,

26:21.547 --> 26:23.080
They had that same problem.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.717
Why can't I remember
what happened to me?

26:26.719 --> 26:30.888
Iraq was a toxic wasteland
after shock and awe.

26:30.890 --> 26:34.592
You know, you probably got
exposed to some bad chemical.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.560
I mean, it was all
in the air, you know.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.929
Why don't you just
think of it as a bonus?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.799
Lot of things I wish
I could forget in that place.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.469
A lot.

26:51.576 --> 26:53.644
(sputtering)

27:02.454 --> 27:06.056
Dobson:
You can't even steal a car
with a good radiator.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.025
You're hopeless.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.062
You'd better call

27:12.064 --> 27:13.430
For a ride.

27:13.432 --> 27:14.832
So I can tip off your
guys to our location?

27:14.834 --> 27:17.101
Yeah, I don't think so.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.770
(panting)
come on.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.305
We're walking.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.741
(panting heavily)

27:34.319 --> 27:37.154
I need you to call
martin again.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.857
He won't answer
his phone.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.826
What's gonna happen when he
finds out I've been lying to him

27:42.828 --> 27:44.495
For the past ten years?

27:44.497 --> 27:46.263
How's he gonna react
to that?

27:46.265 --> 27:47.698
You got to make sure
that doesn't happen.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.966
Look, nelson,

27:48.968 --> 27:50.634
I'm sticking to the script.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.503
He's not stupid.
He's gonna figure it out.

27:52.505 --> 27:55.806
For his safety-- hell, for
his sanity-- that can't happen.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.675
He can't ever know the truth.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.309
You know how he is.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.978
He's not gonna stop.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.681
Well, he started falling apart
when you two separated.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.182
Don't put this on me.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.317
He has issues every time
he comes out of a legend.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.320
He gets erratic,
unpredictable.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.857
We separated because
I was worried about aiden.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.493
Do you love him?

28:16.495 --> 28:19.863
Yeah. I do.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.500
Get back together with him.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.570
He's gonna need you
when he comes home.

28:32.410 --> 28:35.145
We'll keep heading west.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.848
There's got to be a farm,
gas station, something.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.083
I got to stop.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.084
(groans)

28:40.086 --> 28:41.518
Aah!

28:41.520 --> 28:43.353
I popped some stitches.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.590
(panting)
I'm bleeding.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.727
I feel sick.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.528
I think my wound's infected.

28:51.530 --> 28:54.098
You can still walk.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.034
Come on!

28:57.036 --> 28:59.870
I told you
everything I know.

28:59.872 --> 29:02.573
You want to live,

29:02.575 --> 29:05.275
You're gonna have to tell me
a lot more than that.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.947
I need water.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.954
There's water straight ahead.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.222
Get up.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.557
Come on.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.626
Move.
(moans)

29:26.765 --> 29:28.465
Here.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.002
This place looks
abandoned.

29:34.739 --> 29:37.574
One road coming in.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.777
If they find us,

29:39.779 --> 29:41.912
At least I'll see 'em coming.
You're trapped.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.915
It's a good place
for a last stand, isn't it?

29:44.917 --> 29:47.251
(moans)
inside. Come on.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.686
(dobson panting)

29:53.625 --> 29:54.958
Here.
(moaning)

29:54.960 --> 29:58.128
(grunts, moans, panting)

29:58.130 --> 29:59.997
I'm not gonna make it.

30:00.932 --> 30:02.499
Septic shock.

30:03.768 --> 30:07.738
You ever seen it?
Nasty way to go.

30:07.740 --> 30:11.341
Look, I'll try and
find a first aid kit.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.595
You find a
first aid kit?

30:31.597 --> 30:34.531
Yeah, from 1970.

30:36.367 --> 30:37.467
Hold still.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.870
(yelling)
see that?

30:39.872 --> 30:41.338
We haven't even started
the interrogation yet,

30:41.340 --> 30:42.873
And I've still got
half a bottle left.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.409
(chuckles)

30:49.514 --> 30:51.181
What just flashed?

30:53.151 --> 30:55.819
What's this?

30:55.821 --> 30:57.120
You know what that is.

30:58.556 --> 31:01.625
They're not tracking me
by phone.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.496
They're following you with this.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.233
Son of a bitch.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.834
I figure you got two hours

31:10.836 --> 31:12.502
Before they get here

31:12.504 --> 31:13.937
And smoke your ass.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.978
(sighs)

31:20.980 --> 31:23.146
(dialing)

31:23.148 --> 31:24.581
(line ringing)

31:24.583 --> 31:26.717
(phone ringing)

31:26.719 --> 31:29.186
Hello?

31:29.188 --> 31:30.354
Hello, maggie. It's me.

31:30.356 --> 31:32.389
Oh, my god, martin,
where are you?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.690
Somewhere in texas.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.259
Oil fields east of austin.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.427
Look, I don't have
a lot of time, maggie.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.229
Use my cell signal,
trace my location.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.199
Okay, I'm on it.
Zeroing in. Hang on.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.701
I'm gonna ping the signal.
(computer trilling, beeps)

31:44.703 --> 31:46.069
Okay, I have your location.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.671
Good.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.374
Tell gates I'm bracing for
an assault. I need backup now.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.442
Okay. I'll tell him right away.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.711
Martin, I'm-I'm sorry.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.546
When I helped you,
I didn't think that you were...

31:56.548 --> 31:58.115
You didn't do anything wrong,
maggie.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.550
Nothing that happens
to me is your fault, okay?

32:00.552 --> 32:02.686
I'm just sorry
I got you involved.
No, I wanted to help.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.455
(beeps)

32:12.096 --> 32:13.931
Sir, I just got a call
from martin.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.766
I have his location,
but he needs help.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.234
Where is he?
Five and a half
miles northeast

32:17.236 --> 32:19.436
Of austin.
Call the austin
field office.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.571
Brief them on the situation
under my authorization.

32:21.573 --> 32:22.706
I'll call crystal.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.341
Okay.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.493
(creaking)

33:13.124 --> 33:13.790
What's all that?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.659
(gasoline sloshing)

33:15.661 --> 33:17.027
My last stand.

33:19.864 --> 33:21.064
Your men...

33:21.966 --> 33:22.799
...How many are there?

33:22.801 --> 33:23.800
Don't know.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.469
Three?

33:25.471 --> 33:26.903
Maybe four.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.109
Five rounds left.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.944
To fight
several highly trained killers

33:33.946 --> 33:35.812
With automatic weapons?

33:35.814 --> 33:36.947
You can't win,
you know that, right?

33:38.316 --> 33:39.416
I don't have to win.

33:40.885 --> 33:43.220
I just have to endure.

33:49.827 --> 33:51.661
Dobson:
<i>You don't remember anything</i>

33:51.663 --> 33:55.165
About the end?
In basra.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.234
When it all went up
in a giant fireball?

33:57.236 --> 33:59.569
No.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.738
It was hell on earth.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.740
Bombs came from our boys,
by the way.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.275
U.S. Air force.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.280
I was on my way out of the
base when the first one hit.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.219
What base?

34:16.221 --> 34:18.555
For verax.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.091
We had a major
operations hub out there.

34:21.093 --> 34:24.227
Outside of u.S. Purview.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.262
Doing what?

34:25.264 --> 34:26.897
Reaping the spoils of war.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.899
Oil...

34:28.901 --> 34:31.435
Guns, you know, machinery.

34:31.437 --> 34:32.736
You name it.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.571
Stealing.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.440
Mm-hmm.

34:36.442 --> 34:40.777
You know, when the, uh, first
bomb hit, a daisy cutter,

34:40.779 --> 34:45.015
The concussion rolled my humvee
I was in right over.

34:45.017 --> 34:47.417
Put us in a ravine. That
probably saved my life.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.253
Then the other bombs.
The ground shook.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.855
I saw people burned to the bone

34:51.857 --> 34:54.858
Where they stood.
Bombs kept on falling.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.927
It wouldn't stop.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.128
It was the apocalypse.

34:58.130 --> 35:01.131
Friendly fire.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.300
An accident.
Too many bombs

35:03.302 --> 35:05.135
On target to be a mistake.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.637
Raining fire.
It did.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.939
All that oil blown up.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.774
It ignited.

35:10.776 --> 35:15.612
It fell from the sky
like the world was over.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.448
(explosions)

35:23.621 --> 35:26.957
I was there.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.825
In basra.

35:28.827 --> 35:32.062
I was definitely there.
Over 100

35:32.064 --> 35:33.663
Verax employees,

35:33.665 --> 35:35.999
Innocent men
and women,

35:36.001 --> 35:38.969
They got burned
alive that day.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.871
Wonder how you survived.

35:41.839 --> 35:44.307
I don't know.

35:47.478 --> 35:50.480
(vehicles approaching)

35:54.152 --> 35:55.819
Your time's up,
my friend.

35:55.821 --> 35:56.653
They're here.

35:57.421 --> 35:59.256
Get up.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.724
(moans)
move. Move.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.397
(panting)

36:11.002 --> 36:12.202
What are you doing?

36:12.204 --> 36:13.904
Saving your life.

36:39.730 --> 36:40.697
(shouts)

36:41.365 --> 36:42.432
(grunts)

36:47.138 --> 36:48.305
(gunfire)

36:56.814 --> 36:58.215
(screams)

37:14.599 --> 37:16.633
Drop the gun!

37:17.902 --> 37:19.236
Do it now!

37:24.342 --> 37:26.243
(gunshots)

37:26.245 --> 37:28.144
(gunfire)

37:29.580 --> 37:31.314
(gunshots)

37:32.917 --> 37:34.918
(hatch opens)

37:36.187 --> 37:38.021
(grunts)

37:38.023 --> 37:40.023
I thought you'd be dead by now.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.926
Shut up.
(chuckles)

37:42.928 --> 37:44.928
So what's your plan?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.429
All else fails,

37:46.431 --> 37:48.765
I can use you as leverage.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.966
I want immunity.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.768
Depends on what you know.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.969
They killed
their own men.

37:52.971 --> 37:56.539
See, I want to know
the truth about my past.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.942
I can get
to verax's personnel records,

37:58.944 --> 38:02.646
Find out who you are.
If you worked for them,

38:02.648 --> 38:05.115
There'll be a record.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.950
Yeah? Why the change of heart?

38:06.952 --> 38:11.121
I've been thinking
about what you've been saying.

38:11.123 --> 38:14.557
I don't know if they're here
to rescue me or...

38:14.559 --> 38:16.459
Kill me.
Wilkins:
You're trapped, agent odum!

38:17.461 --> 38:20.297
Nowhere to go now!

38:20.299 --> 38:22.299
How do you want to do this?

38:22.301 --> 38:25.735
Verax--
they were dispatching snipers

38:25.737 --> 38:29.072
To go after
high-level contractors

38:29.074 --> 38:32.142
Who were working for the enemy.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.476
The enemy?

38:33.478 --> 38:34.978
Al-qaeda?

38:34.980 --> 38:36.313
No.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.982
U.S....

38:38.984 --> 38:40.650
And british command.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.353
Verax has secrets to protect.

38:43.355 --> 38:46.022
How's that loyalty

38:46.024 --> 38:48.325
Working for you now?
(chuckles)

38:48.327 --> 38:50.026
You're gonna leave me no choice!

38:50.028 --> 38:51.494
I'm gonna torch
this place!

38:51.496 --> 38:53.196
You got to get me out of here.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.665
Tell me everything.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.834
You go on record
to the u.S. Attorney

38:57.836 --> 39:00.403
About verax's activities,
I'll get you out of here.

39:03.207 --> 39:04.908
You got a deal.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.179
Dobson...

39:09.181 --> 39:10.847
Do you know who I am?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.918
No.

39:23.561 --> 39:24.861
Afraid you're not gonna make it,
dobbie.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.696
Nothing personal.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.465
Orders from the main office.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.433
Nice organization
you guys work for.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.536
(door creaks)

39:33.538 --> 39:35.205
(distant sirens wailing)

39:35.207 --> 39:36.206
Three rounds left.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.143
Make 'em count.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.548
(gunshots)

39:50.554 --> 39:53.456
(sirens wailing)

39:54.392 --> 39:56.259
(dobson grunts)

39:56.261 --> 39:58.228
Mr. Dobson needs to
get patched up enough

39:58.230 --> 39:59.763
To get him on a jet to dco.

39:59.765 --> 40:04.234
We'll arrange it now.
Can I get an emt in here?

40:04.236 --> 40:07.237
(panting)
I can walk.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.805
(panting)

40:13.277 --> 40:14.244
You okay?

40:14.246 --> 40:15.812
Yeah.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.121
Get down!

40:25.123 --> 40:26.256
(gunshot)

40:26.258 --> 40:28.091
Man (over radio):
Shots fired! Shots fired!

40:28.093 --> 40:29.626
Sniper! Sniper!
Shots fired!
Man down!

40:29.628 --> 40:31.628
Man down! Man down!

40:31.630 --> 40:35.665
Secure the area.
I repeat: Secure the area.
