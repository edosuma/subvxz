WEBVTT

00:09.216 --> 00:13.512
That's all for today.
Bob Bulldog Briscoe is up next.

00:13.679 --> 00:17.683
Oh, yes! This is KACL cash call week.

00:17.850 --> 00:21.771
$5,000 if you answer your phone
with the phrase that pays.

00:21.937 --> 00:24.440
So don't say "Hello". Say...

00:24.607 --> 00:26.650
Well, blow me down!

00:26.817 --> 00:32.323
No. Say, "KACL is the talk of the town,
talk of Seattle." Whatever. Bye-bye.

00:33.782 --> 00:36.243
Sam! Oh, my God!

00:39.205 --> 00:43.417
- What are you doing in town?
- I'm here interviewing for a job.

00:43.584 --> 00:47.129
The Mariners need a pitching coach
and called me.

00:47.296 --> 00:50.758
They did?
I mean, that's great. Come on in.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.762
- You're off the air?
- Yes.

00:54.928 --> 00:57.222
Frase, I got to go. Your messages...

00:57.389 --> 01:00.017
Whoa. Who is this?

01:01.643 --> 01:05.564
I'm Sam Malone.
I was a buddy of Frasier's in Boston.

01:05.731 --> 01:07.024
Roz Doyle.

01:07.191 --> 01:11.820
This is the Sam who has no respect
for women and treats them like dirt?

01:13.113 --> 01:15.908
Need anyone
to show you around Seattle?

01:16.074 --> 01:21.455
I'm all right with the city,
but I get real lost in my hotel room.

01:23.165 --> 01:25.792
Look at the two of you, face to face.

01:25.959 --> 01:30.756
Wild animals everywhere are
lifting their heads, alerted to the scent.

01:30.922 --> 01:32.382
Bye, Roz.

01:32.549 --> 01:36.511
lf you need any company, give me a call.

01:36.678 --> 01:39.222
- Snazzy card.
- It glows in the dark.

01:39.389 --> 01:41.266
So do I.

01:43.894 --> 01:46.480
So how's everybody at Cheers?

01:48.106 --> 01:53.028
Well, let's see...
Rebecca married that plumber.

01:53.195 --> 01:58.283
She tries so hard to land a rich guy
and ends up with an ordinary plumber.

01:58.450 --> 02:03.872
He struck gold. He's got a patent
on some low-flow toilet thing.

02:04.039 --> 02:06.666
He's rich beyond her wildest dreams.

02:06.833 --> 02:10.919
- I'm happy for her.
- Don't be. He dumped her.

02:12.922 --> 02:16.468
- She's back at the bar.
- Working at Cheers again?

02:16.634 --> 02:19.012
No, she's just back at the bar.

02:20.221 --> 02:24.726
Here's some good news.
Woody and Kelly had a baby boy.

02:24.893 --> 02:27.103
That is wonderful!

02:27.270 --> 02:29.189
Is he...?

02:29.355 --> 02:32.108
No, he's smart.

02:35.486 --> 02:38.072
Genetics takes a holiday, huh?

02:38.239 --> 02:41.576
- Want to continue this over lunch?
- I'd like that.

02:41.743 --> 02:46.581
- Norm and Cliff still holding up the bar?
- Norm is, but Cliff isn't.

02:46.748 --> 02:52.086
He read about that flesh-eating bug
and hasn't left his mum's house since.

02:53.212 --> 02:57.133
It's good cos a lot of people
who haven't been around

02:57.300 --> 02:59.594
are starting to come back.

03:05.308 --> 03:09.729
Sam was a Major League ballplayer.
Put out the good china.

03:09.896 --> 03:13.441
And don't forget the Limoges spittoon.

03:15.985 --> 03:20.531
Sam's the most important person
ever to set foot in this apartment.

03:20.698 --> 03:25.578
This American obsession with
superficial sports figures beats me.

03:25.745 --> 03:30.875
Yeah. They don't do anything important
like sit on a throne or christen ships.

03:31.834 --> 03:34.420
Niles, why didn't you bring Maris?

03:34.587 --> 03:38.549
Ask Maris to spend an evening
with a baseball player?

03:38.716 --> 03:42.720
Why don't I just ask her
to rub my shoulders?

03:44.096 --> 03:47.224
- Here we are.
- Wow, look at this.

03:47.391 --> 03:49.935
You got quite a babe magnet here.

03:51.312 --> 03:56.650
Sam Malone! I'm Marty Crane!
I'm one of your biggest fans!

03:56.817 --> 04:02.114
I was at the Kingdome the night you
gave up four consecutive home runs.

04:02.281 --> 04:07.369
- I bet you remember that.
- No, that was during my drinking phase.

04:07.536 --> 04:11.123
- Did I hit anybody? Did I hurt them?
- No.

04:11.290 --> 04:14.376
Hey, that was a good game then.

04:15.043 --> 04:20.007
- This is my chair. You want to sit in it?
- Oh, yeah. Well, maybe later.

04:21.591 --> 04:23.719
I'll keep it warm for you.

04:24.803 --> 04:29.725
- This is my brother, Dr Niles Crane.
- Pleasure to meet you.

04:30.851 --> 04:35.522
Man, this is freaky. He looks
just like you did when I met you.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.942
What happened?

04:40.027 --> 04:44.281
It wasn't exactly a health club
you were running there, Sam.

04:45.782 --> 04:49.077
This is strange.
I didn't know he had a brother.

04:52.873 --> 04:57.919
In all the time you spent swapping
<i>bon mots</i> with the beer-nut set,

04:58.086 --> 05:00.964
you never mentioned
you had a brother?

05:02.007 --> 05:07.220
I bet he said something, but when
he gets going, you have to tune him out.

05:07.387 --> 05:12.017
Good slogan for his show: "When he
gets going, you have to tune him out."

05:13.852 --> 05:17.772
What did he say about me?
The father, the old cop?

05:18.857 --> 05:21.359
He told me you were dead.

05:22.026 --> 05:24.821
- Dead?
- We had had an argument.

05:24.988 --> 05:28.199
You called me
a stuffed shirt and hung up on me.

05:28.366 --> 05:32.620
You're a cop? You told me
he was a research scientist.

05:33.913 --> 05:37.125
You were dead! What did it matter?

05:42.338 --> 05:47.844
Daphne, this is Sam Malone. Daphne
Moon, Dad's physical therapist.

05:48.011 --> 05:50.263
Pleasure to meet you.

05:50.430 --> 05:54.308
- Daphne's from England.
- I'm a sucker for the accent.

05:54.475 --> 05:59.355
No matter what you say, it always
sounds so classy and sophisticated.

05:59.522 --> 06:01.816
(Gushes effusively)

06:01.983 --> 06:05.403
See what I mean?
That kills me every time.

06:05.570 --> 06:10.408
Let me get that. You shouldn't spend
your whole evening in the kitchen.

06:17.915 --> 06:20.626
Is Sam flirting with Daphne?

06:20.793 --> 06:23.963
Of course he is.
He flirts with everybody.

06:24.130 --> 06:28.551
He's a sexual compulsive. But
he's getting help in a support group.

06:28.718 --> 06:31.887
(Laughter in the kitchen)

06:32.054 --> 06:34.473
Did he miss a meeting?

06:37.852 --> 06:39.895
(Telephone rings)

06:41.439 --> 06:44.733
Hello? You'd like to speak to Sam?

06:44.900 --> 06:49.363
- Who is it?
- Who's calling, please? Sheila.

06:51.949 --> 06:56.078
He's not here,
but I'm expecting him soon.

06:56.245 --> 07:01.166
- No! Number two!
- I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.294
He was here, but he left.

07:07.881 --> 07:10.551
I'll give him the message. Thank you.

07:10.718 --> 07:14.138
I'm sorry, Sam.
I'm a little out of practice.

07:15.973 --> 07:19.059
So...who's Sheila?

07:19.226 --> 07:22.521
Just the woman I'm supposed to marry.

07:23.647 --> 07:25.732
Marry? When?

07:27.442 --> 07:29.695
Oh, boy. Yesterday.

07:31.530 --> 07:34.575
- Yesterday.
- I don't want to talk about it.

07:34.741 --> 07:37.619
- But, Sam...
- Frase, please?

07:38.620 --> 07:41.206
Something smells yummy here.

07:41.373 --> 07:44.126
Wait a second. I think it's me.

07:45.627 --> 07:48.296
The smell... And I thought...

07:50.966 --> 07:53.593
Come on, Sam, one more.

07:53.760 --> 07:58.181
1949, Yankees, initials VR.

07:58.348 --> 08:00.600
- Vic Raschi.
- You're great!

08:00.767 --> 08:05.355
You just have to give him
the city, the date and the initials.

08:05.522 --> 08:10.193
That's similar to a game
Frasier and I play. I'll go first.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.155
1962, Prague Philharmonic,
viola section, initials CM.

08:14.322 --> 08:17.325
- Czeslaw Milovicz.
- Wrong!

08:17.492 --> 08:21.871
No, Milovicz was first viola
the year before,

08:22.038 --> 08:26.918
but by '62, he'd developed rosin
poisoning and couldn't pluck.

08:27.085 --> 08:29.129
That's a trick question!

08:31.840 --> 08:34.424
Well, I'm off to bed.

08:34.592 --> 08:38.638
Thanks, Sam. The chair's all yours.

08:38.804 --> 08:40.849
Come on!

08:42.851 --> 08:46.271
Oh, yeah. That's very nice.

08:46.437 --> 08:48.648
Night, all.

08:48.815 --> 08:51.067
- I'm turning in.
- Pleasant dreams.

08:51.234 --> 08:53.278
No problem there.

08:55.154 --> 08:58.700
I'm off to my Maris.
lf the clock strikes twelve

08:58.866 --> 09:02.787
and she hasn't felt my kiss upon
her forehead, she gets nervous.

09:02.954 --> 09:05.748
- It's been a pleasure meeting you.
- You, too.

09:05.915 --> 09:10.711
You want to put a smile on Maris's face?
Let me tell you what you do.

09:13.339 --> 09:17.635
Where would I find whipped cream
and a car battery at this hour?

09:18.928 --> 09:21.931
You got neighbours, don't you?

09:27.895 --> 09:32.483
Now that everybody's gone, there
was something I wanted to bring up.

09:32.650 --> 09:35.569
What is it? Oh, yes!

09:35.736 --> 09:38.572
You were about to get married?

09:42.660 --> 09:46.997
I met this girl six months ago
and we were supposed to get married.

09:47.164 --> 09:52.169
Yesterday, I was standing in this
church and I hear this minister say,

09:52.336 --> 09:56.465
"Will you take this woman
to be your wife?" And I said,

09:56.632 --> 09:58.551
"Who, me?"

09:59.843 --> 10:04.139
I ran down the aisle
and didn't stop running till I got here.

10:04.306 --> 10:06.392
You're not here for the Mariners?

10:06.558 --> 10:10.688
No ballplayer is in Seattle
for the Mariners!

10:10.854 --> 10:17.361
All right. Let's have a seat here and
start this thing from the very beginning.

10:19.363 --> 10:24.576
- Who is this woman?
- She's terrific. Smart, funny, horny.

10:24.743 --> 10:28.539
The kind of chick you want
to stick up on a pedestal.

10:28.705 --> 10:30.791
It's always amazed me

10:30.958 --> 10:34.419
how you can elevate and demean
in the same sentence.

10:36.213 --> 10:38.840
- What?
- Forget it, just...

10:39.716 --> 10:42.970
How do you think she found me here?

10:43.136 --> 10:48.058
I guess you left a lot of clues
because you wanted her to find you.

10:48.225 --> 10:54.898
I have a feeling you actually...
want to marry this girl.

10:55.065 --> 10:57.150
Yeah, I don't know...

10:57.317 --> 11:00.862
You just panicked. It's perfectly natural.

11:01.029 --> 11:05.784
The wedding ceremony
represents the end of your old life.

11:05.951 --> 11:09.621
I tell you, man, she's one in a million.

11:09.788 --> 11:13.083
For most guys,
that's just an expression.

11:16.920 --> 11:22.759
I have a feeling that you're finally
ready for a commitment like this.

11:23.927 --> 11:27.806
- Get on that phone and call her.
- What would I say though?

11:27.972 --> 11:30.183
Tell her the truth.

11:30.350 --> 11:34.938
Honesty is the cornerstone
of a healthy relationship.

11:37.524 --> 11:39.984
Thank you.

11:40.151 --> 11:44.364
It's time I stepped up to the plate
and stopped acting like a kid.

11:44.531 --> 11:48.576
The only question now is:
will she still take you back?

11:50.000 --> 11:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:59.420 --> 12:03.508
- She forgave him?
- Yes. She's on her way here.

12:03.675 --> 12:05.718
They're getting married in Hawaii.

12:05.885 --> 12:09.597
Same old story.
Love triumphs over Roz.

12:09.764 --> 12:15.103
Don't be a sore loser. I invited them
here on their way in from the airport.

12:15.269 --> 12:19.065
I remember my wedding day,
feeling faint, shaking, sweating.

12:19.232 --> 12:22.318
Maris was so distraught,
thinking I had cold feet.

12:22.485 --> 12:27.823
She was relieved to learn it was
just a congenital heart murmur.

12:28.824 --> 12:31.035
- Hey, everybody.
- Oh, Sam!

12:31.202 --> 12:35.289
Here she is,
the future Mrs Sam Malone.

12:35.456 --> 12:38.626
- Sheila, Frasier.
- Nice to finally meet you.

12:38.793 --> 12:42.755
Likewise. This is Roz and Niles.

12:42.922 --> 12:46.384
- Congratulations.
- You want to sit down?

12:46.550 --> 12:49.053
Actually, it was a long flight.

12:49.220 --> 12:52.556
I was hoping to go
to the hotel and freshen up.

12:52.723 --> 12:56.477
All right. Will you join us
for dinner about eight?

12:56.644 --> 12:58.771
Sure.

12:58.938 --> 13:02.107
Well, I guess we're off
to freshen up a little.

13:06.111 --> 13:10.741
- Oh, my God!
- She's not an "Oh, my God!"

13:10.908 --> 13:13.243
No. Not that "Oh, my God".

13:13.410 --> 13:16.705
Oh, my God, I slept
with her three months ago.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.752
- You slept with her?
- Yes.

13:21.919 --> 13:25.881
On what desert island
with no hope of rescue was this?

13:28.258 --> 13:31.345
I was in Boston for a long weekend.

13:31.512 --> 13:33.555
I was feeling a little depressed

13:33.722 --> 13:38.352
so I took solace in the arms
of a beautiful

13:38.519 --> 13:42.064
and remarkably welcoming
young woman at a hotel bar.

13:42.231 --> 13:44.524
- And that was she?
- No, Niles.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.694
I told you that
for no reason whatsoever(!)

13:47.861 --> 13:52.324
Did you see the way she ran out of here
the minute she saw me?

13:52.491 --> 13:55.285
The trademark of all your bed mates.

13:59.164 --> 14:03.210
Three months ago? Sam said
they'd been together for six months.

14:03.376 --> 14:07.172
It looks like
this horse race is on again.

14:07.339 --> 14:13.011
Oh, put the weapon down!
Stop it, Roz! Have you no scruples?

14:13.178 --> 14:16.473
- You slept with your friend's fiancée!
- I didn't know!

14:16.640 --> 14:21.519
- You have to tell Sam about this.
- And ruin our relationship and theirs?

14:21.686 --> 14:25.649
I've got to speak to her first.
Hear her side of this story.

14:25.815 --> 14:28.735
There are many reasons
why people have affairs.

14:28.902 --> 14:32.030
Roz, want to get us started?

14:33.198 --> 14:37.077
Maybe they stopped seeing each other
for a couple of weeks.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.580
Or he cheated on her
and she was getting even.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.625
Maybe she just found me irresistible.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.835
Oh, yeah, that's it!

14:46.002 --> 14:48.546
You struck gold there.

14:50.465 --> 14:52.509
(Door knocks)

14:54.052 --> 14:58.431
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Sheila. Good to see you again.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.059
Sam, you are one lucky guy!

15:01.225 --> 15:06.105
- He's out getting our plane tickets.
- You have some explaining to do.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.692
- OK. Wine?
- No, thank you.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.739
I know this doesn't excuse what I did,

15:14.906 --> 15:18.117
but I had no idea that
you were a friend of Sam's.

15:18.284 --> 15:24.665
I'm a sexual compulsive.
That's how Sam and I met, in group.

15:27.210 --> 15:31.839
That night I spent with you,
I guess I just fell off the wagon.

15:32.006 --> 15:34.675
I felt awful afterwards.

15:34.842 --> 15:40.931
It ended up being a turning point for me.
That's how it is with addiction.

15:41.098 --> 15:45.686
Before you get better,
you have to hit rock bottom.

15:48.606 --> 15:50.483
Yes. Well...

15:50.649 --> 15:54.612
I'm glad
I could be down there for you.

15:57.198 --> 16:01.327
Listen, Frasier, I'm human.
I made a mistake.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.496
Can you understand that?

16:03.662 --> 16:06.040
Of course I can understand.

16:06.207 --> 16:09.793
I've had many patients
that share your affliction,

16:09.960 --> 16:12.004
although only you can hit

16:12.171 --> 16:15.799
the emergency button of an elevator
with a stiletto heel.

16:17.092 --> 16:22.765
I love Sam. I'll do everything I can
to make this marriage work.

16:22.931 --> 16:25.976
You seem sincere about this.

16:26.143 --> 16:29.104
I think I can support this marriage.

16:29.271 --> 16:34.026
But if you start to feel yourself slipping,
here's my number.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.615
No, no. So I can help you
as a psychiatrist!

16:39.781 --> 16:41.867
Thank you.

16:42.784 --> 16:47.956
I think it's probably best if we
don't tell Sam about the two of us.

16:48.123 --> 16:50.792
Not that I have a guilty conscience.

16:50.959 --> 16:52.836
I'm back.

16:55.213 --> 16:57.674
You all right?

16:58.258 --> 17:00.594
Got a little charley horse.

17:00.761 --> 17:05.390
- Did you get the tickets?
- Yeah, I did. They're right here.

17:05.557 --> 17:11.104
I'm so happy. By this time tomorrow,
we'll be Mr and Mrs Sam Malone.

17:13.982 --> 17:16.484
I want to talk to you about that.

17:17.694 --> 17:22.073
Frasier said something the other day
that really stuck in my mind.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.701
What did I say?

17:24.867 --> 17:28.705
That thing about honesty
being something of something...

17:28.872 --> 17:31.708
It was pro-honesty.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.755
Being the cornerstone
of a good relationship?

17:36.921 --> 17:39.758
Right. That really stuck in my mind.

17:41.843 --> 17:47.182
- I haven't been honest with you.
- What do you mean?

17:47.348 --> 17:52.103
When we get married, I want us
to have a clean slate, sweetheart.

17:53.438 --> 18:00.111
I hope you can forgive me for this,
but a few months ago, I had a slip.

18:00.278 --> 18:05.533
It was two slips, but they were
simultaneous, so I'm counting it as one.

18:08.161 --> 18:10.955
Was this after you were engaged?

18:11.122 --> 18:14.000
Actually, it was that night.

18:16.586 --> 18:19.130
I'm so sorry.

18:19.297 --> 18:23.760
It has not happened since
and I swear it will not happen again.

18:23.926 --> 18:26.429
- I forgive you.
- You do?

18:26.596 --> 18:31.309
I'm relieved. I have something
I need to confess to you.

18:31.476 --> 18:35.146
You're not the only one
who...slipped.

18:35.313 --> 18:38.024
You should have a little privacy.

18:38.190 --> 18:43.487
No, you're responsible for getting
us this far. We have no secrets.

18:43.654 --> 18:47.533
All right. Who?

18:47.700 --> 18:53.122
That's what makes it so tough.
It was someone from Cheers.

18:53.289 --> 18:56.751
I parked in a loading zone!

18:56.917 --> 18:59.295
Sam, I slept with Paul.

18:59.462 --> 19:01.672
Paul?

19:01.839 --> 19:03.466
- Short?
- Bald?

19:03.632 --> 19:05.676
- Fat?
- Paul?

19:05.843 --> 19:07.887
I didn't say he was good.

19:10.181 --> 19:12.558
All right. I understand that.

19:12.725 --> 19:15.644
You were giving Paul
a break or something.

19:15.811 --> 19:20.149
I can forgive that.
Isn't this all about forgiveness?

19:20.316 --> 19:24.903
OK. You told one, you told one.
We're all even. Let's go eat.

19:26.071 --> 19:30.159
- There was someone else.
- Are we still on this?

19:31.118 --> 19:35.622
I mean, there is honesty
and there's beating a dead horse!

19:36.498 --> 19:41.420
- It doesn't matter who it is.
- Yes, it does matter.

19:41.587 --> 19:44.590
This one is really embarrassing.

19:44.756 --> 19:47.676
I was lonely, I was desperate

19:47.843 --> 19:52.222
and I'd just been to the eye
doctor and my pupils were dilated.

19:52.389 --> 19:57.060
Oh, Sheila, for God's sake!
I'll tell him. She's trying to say...

19:57.227 --> 19:59.771
It was Cliff.

20:04.109 --> 20:06.570
I believe she said Cliff.

20:07.988 --> 20:10.157
Cliff?

20:10.323 --> 20:13.577
Cliff? You slept with Cliff?

20:14.286 --> 20:20.041
Cliff! No, that's it!
Wedding's off! Cliff! Oh, God!

20:22.669 --> 20:26.256
Frasier, you've got to help me.
You've got to talk to him.

20:27.799 --> 20:31.177
I slept with a woman
who slept with Cliff?

20:36.808 --> 20:39.644
This will be a long flight home.

20:41.855 --> 20:46.317
- You made the right decision.
- Yeah, I suppose.

20:46.484 --> 20:49.362
Jeez! Cliff!

20:50.613 --> 20:54.200
You're just using Cliff as the excuse.

20:54.367 --> 20:58.830
There were more compelling reasons
for you to back out of this thing.

21:00.165 --> 21:02.792
No, it was Cliff.

21:06.504 --> 21:10.258
To put this thing aside
once and for all, I...

21:10.425 --> 21:14.721
You're probably the only friend
I have who she didn't sleep with.

21:20.059 --> 21:22.103
Cliff!

21:22.270 --> 21:25.982
That is a tough one to swallow, huh?

21:27.650 --> 21:31.320
But you proved yourself
ready for a commitment,

21:31.487 --> 21:33.948
even if Sheila wasn't the one.

21:34.115 --> 21:40.246
- I suppose so.
- In a way, we're both in the same boat.

21:40.413 --> 21:47.003
- What do you mean?
- We've tried, we've failed.

21:47.169 --> 21:49.922
But we'll try again.

21:50.089 --> 21:53.217
We're looking
for a meaningful relationship.

21:53.384 --> 21:56.345
That's the word, "meaningful".

21:56.512 --> 22:01.267
- We'll find it though, buddy.
- You bet we will.

22:02.893 --> 22:05.896
Stewardesses usually
hang out at the airport.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.357
That says "meaningful" to me.

22:15.573 --> 22:21.245
# Baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:21.412 --> 22:22.663
# Mercy!

22:22.830 --> 22:29.878
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:30.045 --> 22:35.926
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:36.093 --> 22:38.679
# They're calling again #

22:38.846 --> 22:41.515
Thank you!
