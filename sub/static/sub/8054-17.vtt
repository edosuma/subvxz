WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:04.268
But we scheduled for
this time on this field.

00:04.535 --> 00:05.635
Okay, this is no way for adults

00:05.703 --> 00:06.903
To act in front of children.

00:06.971 --> 00:08.137
You're not only coaches,
you're also role models.

00:09.373 --> 00:14.206
I would hardly call
what he does coaching.

00:14.274 --> 00:16.782
Oh...Wow. Excellent role modeling.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.944
Apparently, the girls'
team does not have a field

00:19.012 --> 00:21.994
Assigned to them for practice,
but the boys' team does.

00:22.831 --> 00:25.274
No. Not on my watch.

00:25.342 --> 00:27.113
Every child has the right to play,

00:27.181 --> 00:28.819
No matter how boring the sport.

00:28.887 --> 00:30.931
Okay, could you
just share the field

00:30.999 --> 00:32.435
With the girls today, please?

00:32.502 --> 00:35.243
I'm the girls' coach.
She's the boys' coach.

00:35.311 --> 00:37.352
- Oh, okay, sorry.
- That's sexist.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.397
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it kind of is.

00:39.465 --> 00:41.871
Okay, why don't the boys
take the field today

00:41.939 --> 00:43.943
And then I will make
sure that the girls

00:44.011 --> 00:46.249
Get a place to practice
by the end of the week?

00:46.316 --> 00:49.723
And that, little lady,
is a leslie knope promise.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.860
- I'm a boy.
- Good, yeah.

00:51.928 --> 00:53.128
'cause I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to you.

00:53.196 --> 00:54.329
You're a girl, right?

00:54.397 --> 00:57.002
- Yeah.
- Yep. She.

01:19.504 --> 01:21.273
Oh! Hey.

01:21.341 --> 01:22.441
Jerry.

01:22.509 --> 01:24.778
You got soup all over
our mail. You jerk.

01:24.846 --> 01:26.113
Oh, my god.

01:26.181 --> 01:27.649
It's an envelope from the I.
O.W. Awards office.

01:27.717 --> 01:30.487
Nobody freak out.

01:30.554 --> 01:32.523
Do you know what this means?

01:32.591 --> 01:35.426
I am pawnee's woman of the year.

01:35.494 --> 01:38.228
The I.O.W. Is the indiana
organization of women.

01:38.295 --> 01:41.130
I have been a dues-paying
member since I was nine.

01:41.198 --> 01:43.165
And every year,
they choose one woman to win

01:43.233 --> 01:45.869
The dorothy everton smythe
female empowerment award.

01:45.936 --> 01:48.271
Winning is every girl's dream.

01:48.339 --> 01:50.407
But it's my destiny.

01:50.475 --> 01:51.642
And my dream.

01:51.709 --> 01:53.010
Can you read it, please?

01:53.078 --> 01:55.580
Where my ladies at?

01:55.647 --> 01:57.716
Here we go.

01:57.783 --> 02:00.219
The I.O.W. Is proud to
announce this year's

02:00.286 --> 02:01.954
Dorothy everton smythe

02:02.022 --> 02:04.290
Female empowerment award winner:

02:04.358 --> 02:05.492
Ronald swanson.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.027
Ah-ha, okay, pretty funny.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.193
It says ronald swanson.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.763
What? No, no. No, it doesn't.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.566
I--that--no.

02:11.634 --> 02:13.435
That--what?

02:13.503 --> 02:15.070
They--they only honor women,

02:15.138 --> 02:16.438
And ron's the opposite of a woman.

02:16.506 --> 02:17.873
What's going on?

02:17.941 --> 02:19.742
You're, um, pawnee's
woman of the year,

02:19.810 --> 02:23.478
It looks like.

02:23.546 --> 02:25.580
Well, it's about time.

02:25.648 --> 02:26.882
No, no, no.

02:26.950 --> 02:28.250
They've obviously made
some sort of mistake.

02:28.318 --> 02:29.518
Bully for me.

02:29.586 --> 02:31.387
- Congratulations, ron.
- Yeah, congratulations.

02:31.455 --> 02:32.722
Congrats. It's very exciting.

02:32.790 --> 02:33.889
It's awesome.

02:33.957 --> 02:36.257
Awards are stupid.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.360
Which is why I fully intend
to decline this nonsense

02:39.428 --> 02:41.362
And recommend it go to leslie.

02:41.430 --> 02:45.700
Because she works
really hard and I don't.

02:45.768 --> 02:49.871
However, she cares way too
much about crap like this,

02:49.939 --> 02:52.574
Which is why I can't
pass up this opportunity

02:52.641 --> 02:55.043
To tease her about it.

02:55.111 --> 02:56.978
Well, we can't stand around all day

02:57.046 --> 02:59.648
Congratulating me on
receiving an award

02:59.716 --> 03:01.984
From some lousy
women's organization.

03:02.052 --> 03:04.019
Back to work, everyone.

03:09.726 --> 03:11.194
Hey, freddy.

03:11.262 --> 03:12.929
Good news.

03:12.997 --> 03:16.266
Your liquor license
renewal got got, yo.

03:16.334 --> 03:17.334
What do you mean by that?

03:17.401 --> 03:19.435
Oh, I got you temporary approval

03:19.503 --> 03:21.571
From the liquor board
pending full-board

03:21.638 --> 03:23.372
Authorization and council review.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.807
Got got.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.175
Thank you. Thank you so much.

03:26.243 --> 03:27.610
No worries.

03:27.678 --> 03:29.278
You know the snakehole's my
favorite pawnee hot spot.

03:29.346 --> 03:31.247
I wanna open up my
own club one day.

03:31.314 --> 03:33.249
Maybe call it something
like club-a-dub-dub

03:33.317 --> 03:35.151
Or the clubmarine,

03:35.218 --> 03:37.353
Sort of a submarine-themed club.

03:37.421 --> 03:40.056
Or tom's bistro.

03:40.123 --> 03:42.491
The word bistro is classy as .

03:42.559 --> 03:44.193
Tom, man, we are looking for

03:44.261 --> 03:46.930
A few top quality
guys like yourself

03:46.998 --> 03:48.798
To become part owners.

03:48.866 --> 03:51.200
A guy like you with your
political connections,

03:51.268 --> 03:52.635
I think you'd make a great asset.

03:52.702 --> 03:54.003
I agree.

03:54.070 --> 03:55.637
That's why I got into
public service, to help me.

03:55.705 --> 03:58.340
All right. $10,000 a share.

03:58.408 --> 04:00.442
Need the money by Friday.

04:00.510 --> 04:03.946
$10,000. That's chump change.

04:04.013 --> 04:08.183
I will see you Friday with $10,000.

04:08.251 --> 04:11.620
All right, partner.

04:11.687 --> 04:13.555
I just don't get why the I.O.W.

04:13.622 --> 04:14.889
Would give that award to ron.

04:14.957 --> 04:15.957
Yeah, that's a bummer.

04:16.024 --> 04:17.190
One, he's not a woman.

04:17.259 --> 04:19.995
And two, they mention
the camp athena project

04:20.063 --> 04:21.163
In that letter.

04:21.230 --> 04:22.697
That's my project. I started that.

04:22.765 --> 04:24.132
It was my brainchild.

04:24.199 --> 04:26.567
Why would ron start a
camp for troubled girls?

04:26.635 --> 04:28.335
- He wouldn't.
- Exactly.

04:28.403 --> 04:29.536
I deserve that award.

04:29.604 --> 04:31.871
That award is mine, not his.
It's mine.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.005
You know what you should do--

04:33.073 --> 04:34.239
I know, I already started a list.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.040
"write an email to barack obama.

04:36.108 --> 04:37.308
"lock myself in my
office and scream

04:37.376 --> 04:38.475
Until I lose my voice."

04:38.543 --> 04:39.642
That's all I have so far.

04:39.710 --> 04:40.910
I was gonna suggest
maybe you just go

04:40.978 --> 04:42.078
And talk to him.

04:42.145 --> 04:43.479
Oh.

04:43.547 --> 04:45.380
You're only gonna get more
resentful if you don't.

04:48.383 --> 04:50.818
- Hey, ann. How--
- ann.

04:50.885 --> 04:52.386
I have so much I need
to tell you right now.

04:52.453 --> 04:54.387
Hey, ann, leslie would
like to talk to you

04:54.455 --> 04:56.055
For a moment, is that all right?

04:56.123 --> 04:57.856
Good.

04:57.924 --> 04:59.424
Jean-ralphio.

04:59.492 --> 05:02.193
Big t, what it do, nephew?

05:03.995 --> 05:06.029
Jean-ralphio,

05:06.097 --> 05:07.964
I have a hot investment opportunity

05:08.032 --> 05:09.632
That you are gonna
wanna jump all over.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.800
Hit me with it, daddy.

05:10.867 --> 05:13.034
- The snakehole lounge--
- heard of it.

05:13.102 --> 05:15.337
- Is looking for investors.
- No way.

05:15.404 --> 05:16.505
Yesterday if you
would have asked me,

05:16.573 --> 05:17.741
I would have said no, but thank god

05:17.808 --> 05:19.708
My grandfather just died so I am

05:19.776 --> 05:23.244
* fluh-ush with cah-ash *

05:23.312 --> 05:24.412
Awesome.

05:24.479 --> 05:25.946
I have 4,000 bucks.

05:26.014 --> 05:27.914
All I need you to do is kick in 6gs

05:27.982 --> 05:30.449
And then you and I are part owners

05:30.517 --> 05:32.017
Of the hottest nightclub in pawnee.

05:32.085 --> 05:33.752
Also, sorry about your grandpa.

05:33.820 --> 05:35.988
No worries, he was a dick.
Here's the thing.

05:36.056 --> 05:39.158
I can kick in 5gs.
That should be enough, right?

05:39.225 --> 05:41.593
No, it's not enough.
I just said I need 6gs.

05:41.661 --> 05:42.728
What about your trust fund?

05:42.795 --> 05:43.962
My parents had it amended.

05:44.030 --> 05:45.196
I don't get anything until I'm 50,

05:45.264 --> 05:46.397
Which is a waste,
'cause I'm gonna be

05:46.465 --> 05:48.332
A billionaire in
costa rica by then,

05:48.400 --> 05:50.834
Eating dolphins and hanging
out with lady singers.

05:50.902 --> 05:52.536
It's not a huge deal.
Just sit tight.

05:52.604 --> 05:54.104
I'll take care of it.

05:54.172 --> 05:55.271
You wanna come home with me?

05:55.339 --> 05:58.074
Don't you work at lady foot locker?

05:58.141 --> 05:59.908
Look, if you're not gonna pay rent,

05:59.976 --> 06:01.676
At least clean up your dishes.

06:01.744 --> 06:04.345
Ugh! Is that all?

06:04.413 --> 06:05.513
No.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.881
Also, the bag of smells
was a fun experiment,

06:07.949 --> 06:09.048
But it has to stop.

06:09.116 --> 06:10.416
Come on.

06:10.484 --> 06:12.751
Now--no, we're finally starting
to get serious results.

06:12.819 --> 06:14.820
Andy, dude, I love you.

06:14.888 --> 06:18.858
But shape up or move out.

06:18.925 --> 06:20.125
What's going on?

06:20.193 --> 06:21.727
The guitarist from my
band is driving me crazy.

06:21.794 --> 06:23.327
He's such a control freak.

06:23.395 --> 06:25.828
uh, that's not a working
fireplace, andy.

06:25.896 --> 06:28.397
Stop writing phone
messages on the wall, andy.

06:28.465 --> 06:29.698
Dude, seriously, I love you,

06:29.766 --> 06:32.166
But stop digging that weird
hole in the backyard.

06:32.234 --> 06:33.468
Is mouse rat gonna break up?

06:33.536 --> 06:35.137
Well, we're not mouse rat anymore.

06:35.205 --> 06:36.505
We changed it to tackleshaft.

06:36.573 --> 06:37.672
Oh.

06:37.740 --> 06:39.774
I should just get my own place.

06:39.842 --> 06:41.976
You should. I'll help you.

06:42.044 --> 06:44.111
- You could help me?
- Yeah, that'd be fun.

06:44.179 --> 06:47.180
April, you're like an
angel with no wings.

06:47.248 --> 06:48.815
So like a person.

06:51.819 --> 06:53.919
Hey. What's in the envelope?

06:53.987 --> 06:57.289
Nothing. You wanted to see me?

06:57.357 --> 06:59.491
I think the pawnee
chapter of the I.O.W.

06:59.559 --> 07:00.592
Has a made a little mistake.

07:00.660 --> 07:03.094
Rr, rr, rr. Really?

07:03.161 --> 07:06.197
You're saying a women's
organization made a mistake?

07:06.264 --> 07:07.765
I was as surprised as you were.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.133
But the fact is,

07:09.200 --> 07:10.967
They only give that award to women.

07:11.035 --> 07:12.269
Hmm.

07:12.336 --> 07:14.704
Well, it definitely said
ron swanson in the letter.

07:14.771 --> 07:17.338
Yeah, but it also
mentioned my camp project.

07:17.406 --> 07:18.772
Ah, yes, camp xena.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.173
Athena. Camp athena.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.541
You don't even know the name.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.042
Oh, I almost got it.
It was pretty close.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.543
- No.
- Look, leslie.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.112
Your job, which you're great at,

07:27.180 --> 07:28.346
Is making me look good.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.549
Which you've clearly done well

07:30.616 --> 07:32.984
Because I'm getting an award.

07:33.051 --> 07:34.685
Right?

07:34.753 --> 07:36.687
- Yeah?
- Be proud of yourself.

07:36.755 --> 07:38.455
I mean, you deserve an award.

07:38.523 --> 07:41.524
Not this one, obviously.
This one belongs to me.

07:41.592 --> 07:43.159
But some other one.

07:43.227 --> 07:45.794
Some other lesser award.

07:45.861 --> 07:47.095
And if the shoe were
on the other foot

07:47.163 --> 07:49.864
And you won the award,
I would have congratulated you.

07:52.334 --> 07:53.434
congratulations, ron.

07:53.502 --> 07:57.237
- What's that?
- You heard me.

07:57.305 --> 07:58.472
You promised the girls a field

07:58.539 --> 07:59.839
By the end of this week.

07:59.907 --> 08:03.476
Well, it's a man's world,
winston, get used to it.

08:03.543 --> 08:06.445
I'm a man.

08:06.513 --> 08:08.313
You know who you should talk to?

08:08.381 --> 08:09.481
Ron swanson.

08:09.549 --> 08:11.283
He's an award winning
public servant.

08:11.350 --> 08:12.517
He's the guy that's
gonna help you out.

08:12.585 --> 08:14.719
Go on in there.

08:14.787 --> 08:18.055
'scuse me.
Ron, someone's coming in.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.190
Hi.

08:19.257 --> 08:21.224
Leslie said I should
come over here.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.559
If you don't get
credit for your work,

08:22.626 --> 08:24.494
Why bother doing it?

08:24.562 --> 08:26.862
Because I love it.

08:26.930 --> 08:28.597
But I'm gonna make a point.

08:31.015 --> 08:33.884
This vip card gives
you exclusive access

08:33.952 --> 08:36.753
To the investment
opportunity of a lifetime.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.155
Multipurpose room f.

08:39.222 --> 08:41.323
3:00 p.M.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.692
Dress code: Black tie optional.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.227
Just like life.

08:46.295 --> 08:48.329
Hey, you want to see me?

08:48.397 --> 08:52.565
Yes, yes, just hang on one second.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.033
I'm doing my official portrait

08:54.101 --> 08:55.835
For the I.U.D.
Awards dinner program.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.405
I.O.W.

08:58.473 --> 09:01.109
No, this portrait is not
official in any way.

09:01.177 --> 09:02.510
I'm paying for it myself.

09:02.578 --> 09:05.146
Did you need me?

09:05.214 --> 09:07.749
Because some of us actually
do work around here.

09:07.816 --> 09:10.718
Work that often goes unrewarded.

09:10.786 --> 09:12.620
I need your opinion.

09:12.688 --> 09:15.456
Which of these objects
most represents women

09:15.524 --> 09:17.289
For this portrait?

09:17.357 --> 09:19.989
A pot?

09:20.057 --> 09:24.026
Or this deputy director barbie?

09:24.094 --> 09:25.260
Isn't it adorable?

09:25.328 --> 09:27.696
She's got a little briefcase,
her cell phone--

09:27.763 --> 09:30.331
I'm going to help my
boss win an award.

09:30.399 --> 09:32.700
How's the, uh, scheduling conflict

09:32.768 --> 09:33.968
With the soccer teams going?

09:34.035 --> 09:35.002
Take care of that, did you?

09:35.070 --> 09:37.304
Nope. Passed the buck to donna.

09:37.372 --> 09:38.605
That's not really the attitude

09:38.673 --> 09:40.273
I expect from an award winner.

09:40.341 --> 09:42.342
Everything I do is the attitude

09:42.409 --> 09:46.479
Of an award winner because
I've won an award.

09:46.546 --> 09:49.080
So what kind of place
are you looking for?

09:49.148 --> 09:51.215
I can afford, like,
300 bucks a month.

09:51.283 --> 09:53.750
I've always wanted a
doorman named ernie.

09:53.818 --> 09:55.151
That would be awesome. Or kipp.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.318
I'm pretty flexible on that.

09:56.386 --> 09:57.653
Here's a great one.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.555
It's a tudor mansion,
it's got seven rooms,

10:00.623 --> 10:03.024
Four bathrooms,
it's got a tennis court,

10:03.092 --> 10:05.125
A pool, and a three-car garage.

10:05.193 --> 10:06.226
What?

10:06.294 --> 10:08.595
And it's only $20,000 a month.

10:08.663 --> 10:10.029
And it's in chicago.

10:10.097 --> 10:13.232
Aw. That close.
It was almost perfect.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.001
Actually, there are a
couple cool places in here.

10:16.069 --> 10:17.703
- Let's go look at them.
- Now?

10:17.770 --> 10:19.104
- Let's roll.
- Okay.

10:27.813 --> 10:30.047
Thank you all so much
for joining me today.

10:30.115 --> 10:31.548
I have two questions for you.

10:31.616 --> 10:34.150
Are you ready for the
investment opportunity

10:34.218 --> 10:35.318
Of a lifetime?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.419
And two: Do any of
you have pacemakers

10:37.487 --> 10:38.587
Or a history of epilepsy?

10:38.655 --> 10:39.688
Yes, both.

10:39.756 --> 10:42.357
- Anybody, no?--Right.
- Both.

10:46.295 --> 10:48.329
Ladies.

10:48.396 --> 10:50.664
* *

10:50.732 --> 10:54.600
Jay-z. Rihanna. Audrina patridge.

10:54.668 --> 10:59.104
Jon gosselin. Lady gaga. Snooki.

10:59.171 --> 11:00.472
Are these real people?

11:00.539 --> 11:03.040
Cash warren. And dennis rodman.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.608
These are just a few
of the celebrities

11:04.676 --> 11:07.944
That wish they could invest
in pawnee's hottest club.

11:08.012 --> 11:10.980
But they caaaaan't!

11:11.048 --> 11:13.382
And you can for the
small price of only

11:13.449 --> 11:17.183
$1,000.

11:17.251 --> 11:21.520
The only question is,
who's gonna be my partner?

11:21.588 --> 11:23.021
Mark, I'm talking to you.

11:23.089 --> 11:24.456
Donna, I'm talking to you.

11:24.523 --> 11:26.424
Jerry, I'm talking to you.

11:26.492 --> 11:29.827
Mark, I'm talking to you.

11:29.895 --> 11:32.996
26 certificates, plaques,
ribbons, trophies,

11:33.063 --> 11:35.197
Medals, and miscellany
certifying that I am

11:35.265 --> 11:36.998
The kind of person who
deserves recognition

11:37.065 --> 11:38.665
For her achievements.

11:38.733 --> 11:39.932
What do you have, ron?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.468
I have the dorothy
everytime smurf girl trophy

11:43.536 --> 11:45.337
For excellence in female stuff.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.572
Dorothy everton smythe.
I swear to god--

11:47.640 --> 11:49.007
Leslie.

11:49.075 --> 11:52.444
Before you continue,
please read this.

11:52.512 --> 11:53.845
Another organization
giving you credit

11:53.913 --> 11:58.481
For something you didn't do?

11:58.549 --> 12:02.183
"I, ron swanson, recognize that

12:02.251 --> 12:04.821
"leslie knope should have
received the I.O.W. Award

12:04.889 --> 12:06.790
"for all the hard
work she has done,

12:06.857 --> 12:08.758
"especially for the
camp athena project.

12:08.826 --> 12:12.895
"however, in my opinion,
she is far too concerned

12:12.963 --> 12:15.097
With institutional gratification."

12:15.165 --> 12:16.432
No, I'm not.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.737
"so I'm gonna let her
dangle in order to show her

12:20.805 --> 12:24.709
That awards are bull... Crap.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.578
Come on, leslie,
you know I'm not sexist.

12:26.645 --> 12:27.912
I love powerful women.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.582
Well, you do attend a
shocking number of wnba games.

12:30.649 --> 12:34.018
I'm just saying that
awards are political.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.254
And everybody has an agenda.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.888
You spend your life chasing them,

12:37.956 --> 12:39.222
You'll drive yourself nuts.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.590
Yeah, all right.

12:40.657 --> 12:43.156
But dorothy everton smythe
was a trailblazing feminist.

12:43.223 --> 12:44.889
She was the first woman in pawnee

12:44.957 --> 12:46.623
To wear pants on a Sunday.

12:46.691 --> 12:48.223
She spent four years
in jail for that.

12:48.290 --> 12:50.590
I know I'm not supposed to
care about these things,

12:50.658 --> 12:55.094
But this one means a lot.

12:55.162 --> 12:58.931
* I know you've been changing *

12:58.998 --> 13:01.466
The acoustics in the
bathroom are insane.

13:01.534 --> 13:03.767
So, um, how much is this one again?

13:03.834 --> 13:07.168
Uh, this one is $425 a
month plus utilities.

13:07.236 --> 13:08.636
Hmm. I like it.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.671
Uh, it seems to have...

13:10.738 --> 13:13.106
A lot of potential and...

13:13.173 --> 13:16.677
A lot of advantages, per se.

13:16.746 --> 13:17.813
Could definitely picture myself

13:17.881 --> 13:22.718
Doing something over there.

13:22.785 --> 13:24.686
You hear that?

13:24.753 --> 13:26.654
What is that?

13:26.722 --> 13:27.988
It's still on.

13:28.056 --> 13:29.323
You can light a match to
get rid of that smell.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.558
I feel really good about this.

13:31.626 --> 13:33.960
- Really?
- It screams andy dwyer.

13:34.028 --> 13:36.429
And I live nearby,
so we could, like,

13:36.497 --> 13:37.663
Carpool to work or something.

13:37.731 --> 13:38.864
- Oh, are you serious?
- Yep.

13:38.932 --> 13:40.765
The scream just got louder.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.133
Uh, so what do you think?

13:42.201 --> 13:45.869
I don't know, make me an offer.

13:45.937 --> 13:48.605
Okay. First come, first served.

13:48.673 --> 13:50.340
Who's in? Jerry.

13:50.408 --> 13:51.674
Oh, geez, tom.

13:51.742 --> 13:54.210
If I spend any more than 25 bucks,
I gotta ask my wife.

13:54.277 --> 13:57.045
- Jerry, get out.
- Okay.

13:57.113 --> 13:58.647
mark, what are we doing tonight?

13:58.715 --> 14:00.882
oh, I don't know, ann.

14:00.950 --> 14:02.817
We could do the usual boring stuff

14:02.885 --> 14:05.653
Like eat some chicken
salad with some crackers

14:05.720 --> 14:06.887
Or watch the pay-per-view.

14:06.954 --> 14:08.522
Or...

14:08.589 --> 14:11.791
We could go to my nightclub
and do some dancin'.

14:11.859 --> 14:13.059
I don't think so, man.

14:13.126 --> 14:15.627
You'd never have to
beg for sex again.

14:15.695 --> 14:17.095
I don't wanna get
into this, really,

14:17.163 --> 14:19.464
But I don't beg for sex now.

14:19.531 --> 14:21.498
Forget about that, mark.
Are you in or out?

14:21.566 --> 14:23.567
Just not really my thing.

14:23.635 --> 14:27.103
Bye, mark.

14:27.171 --> 14:28.471
Cindy.

14:28.538 --> 14:29.738
* donna *

14:29.806 --> 14:31.573
Maybe. I like the snakehole.

14:31.641 --> 14:33.642
Plus, I would look
good pulling into

14:33.709 --> 14:36.477
My owner's parking
space in my mercedes.

14:36.545 --> 14:38.545
Just to be clear,
you wouldn't be an owner per se.

14:38.613 --> 14:40.179
You, me, and my boy jean-ralphio

14:40.247 --> 14:42.148
Would each own part of a share.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.749
Will that be cash or check?

14:43.817 --> 14:44.984
Not so fast.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.152
I'd like to know who
I'm in business with.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.420
I wanna meet your boy.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.856
Come here. This lady's here.

14:50.923 --> 14:54.426
Hi. I'm elise yarktin.
I'm with the I.O.W.

14:54.493 --> 14:57.427
I'm...Woman of the year,
ron swanson.

14:57.495 --> 14:58.728
Yes, I know.

14:58.796 --> 15:00.196
We are very excited
to be presenting you

15:00.264 --> 15:01.431
With the smythe award.

15:01.498 --> 15:03.633
That's what I called
you to talk about.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.235
I don't know if I can
take all the excitement.

15:06.302 --> 15:09.704
So I think the award should
go to miss knope here.

15:09.772 --> 15:10.872
Hello.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.407
She's the one who
really deserves it.

15:12.475 --> 15:15.110
Camp athena was her idea,
she did all the work.

15:15.177 --> 15:16.278
You made a mistake.

15:16.345 --> 15:18.879
Uh, we didn't make a mistake.

15:18.947 --> 15:21.415
We made a very conscious
decision this year

15:21.482 --> 15:22.949
To choose a man.

15:23.017 --> 15:24.150
Why?

15:24.218 --> 15:26.085
Well, uh, every year
we give it to a woman,

15:26.153 --> 15:27.853
And frankly nobody cares.

15:27.921 --> 15:29.821
Yeah, the media has
all but written us off

15:29.889 --> 15:32.023
As a niche interest group.

15:32.091 --> 15:35.359
But if you give a woman's award to

15:35.427 --> 15:38.796
A mustachioed, masculine
man such as yourself,

15:38.863 --> 15:41.097
Well, then, eventually
people take notice.

15:41.165 --> 15:43.232
I don't want the damn thing.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.400
Well, we're giving it to you.

15:44.468 --> 15:46.735
So you're gonna take it.

15:46.802 --> 15:47.902
Like a man.

15:47.970 --> 15:51.604
So congratulations.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.706
The I.O.W. Is a bunch
of sexist jerks

15:53.773 --> 15:55.674
Who need to get back in the
kitchen where they belong

15:55.743 --> 15:58.312
And leave the real feminist
work to actual feminists

15:58.380 --> 15:59.647
Like ron swanson!

15:59.715 --> 16:01.816
Oh, my god, what is happening?

16:03.905 --> 16:06.138
Now do you see how
silly these things are?

16:06.206 --> 16:07.306
Unbelievable.

16:07.373 --> 16:08.573
Obviously, I'm just
gonna decline it.

16:08.641 --> 16:09.907
No, I want you to accept it.

16:09.975 --> 16:11.243
I want you to go to the
podium and talk about

16:11.310 --> 16:12.443
How stupid awards are.

16:12.511 --> 16:14.611
And how they're superficial
and meaningless.

16:14.679 --> 16:17.013
I want you to rip
awards a new a-hole.

16:17.081 --> 16:19.048
Now we're talking.
I'll tell you what.

16:19.116 --> 16:21.383
You write the speech,
don't pull your punches.

16:21.451 --> 16:23.017
I won't. I'm gonna push my punches.

16:23.085 --> 16:24.652
As far as my fist can extend.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.353
Atta girl.

16:26.421 --> 16:27.454
Kind of.

16:27.522 --> 16:31.257
What up, big t? Stop.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.192
This must be the lovely donna.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.993
<i>Enchante.</i>

16:35.061 --> 16:37.128
Listen, beautiful,
let's cut the bull.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.230
Right? You want this.

16:39.298 --> 16:40.931
I definitely want this.
T.H. Wants this.

16:42.467 --> 16:45.469
Let's seal this devil's
threeway right here, right now.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.370
Step one: We buy into this club.

16:47.438 --> 16:49.505
Step two: We roll over to the club,

16:49.573 --> 16:51.907
Either in your mercedes-benz
or my pre-owned acura legend.

16:51.974 --> 16:55.410
Step three: I dagger
you on the dance floor,

16:55.478 --> 16:56.711
Just bounce, bounce,
bounce, bounce.

16:56.779 --> 16:57.980
* and now all the ladies say *

16:58.047 --> 16:59.881
* bounce, bounce, bounce,
bounce, bounce *

16:59.949 --> 17:01.382
What do you say, sexy?

17:01.450 --> 17:03.451
- I'm out.
- Why?

17:03.519 --> 17:06.353
I hate that guy.

17:08.055 --> 17:09.789
Oh, mr. Swanson.

17:09.857 --> 17:12.491
Hi, welcome to the I.O.W. Awards,

17:12.559 --> 17:14.960
And congratulations on winning.

17:15.028 --> 17:16.127
Yay.

17:16.194 --> 17:18.229
Well, here is your awards packet,

17:18.296 --> 17:19.829
And, uh, if you
will just follow me,

17:19.896 --> 17:21.163
Uh, we're gonna have a
little meet and greet

17:21.231 --> 17:22.330
Before the ceremony.

17:22.398 --> 17:24.199
- Okay.
- Great.

17:24.267 --> 17:25.367
Oh, um, no, I'm sorry,

17:25.435 --> 17:27.469
This area is for
award winners only.

17:27.537 --> 17:29.806
Oh, get over yourself, elise.

17:29.874 --> 17:32.642
Work on the speech.
Let's nail these women.

17:32.709 --> 17:33.909
You know what I mean.

17:33.976 --> 17:35.243
Yeah.

17:35.311 --> 17:37.011
I don't know, andy.
What's it all about?

17:37.079 --> 17:38.947
What's the secret?

17:39.015 --> 17:40.081
Yeah.

17:40.149 --> 17:41.516
Why is it so hard
to become a mogul?

17:41.584 --> 17:43.484
All I want in life
is to own a nightclub

17:43.552 --> 17:44.919
On every continent.

17:44.986 --> 17:46.320
Have my own line of
upscale sweat suits

17:46.388 --> 17:47.888
And a cologne called tommy fresh.

17:47.955 --> 17:49.923
And I fell $1,000 short.

17:49.990 --> 17:52.525
Seriously? That's all you needed?

17:52.593 --> 17:54.194
Tom, I have $1,000.
You can have it.

17:54.261 --> 17:55.862
Thanks, andy,
but I can't take your money.

17:55.930 --> 17:57.430
I'm a singer-songwriter.

17:57.498 --> 18:00.600
The two lines I put into
every song I've ever sang,

18:00.667 --> 18:01.901
"spread your wings and fly"

18:01.968 --> 18:03.502
And "you deserve to be a champion."

18:03.569 --> 18:05.637
You're telling me that all you need

18:05.704 --> 18:08.640
Is $1,000 to do your dreams?

18:08.708 --> 18:11.709
Then I want you to have it.

18:11.776 --> 18:14.011
Are you sure about this?

18:14.078 --> 18:15.579
Maybe.

18:15.646 --> 18:17.046
You know how happy
you just made me?

18:18.281 --> 18:20.515
He's the director of the pawnee

18:20.583 --> 18:22.283
Parks and recreation department.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.751
He is also the recipient
of this year's

18:24.819 --> 18:28.186
Dorothy everton smythe
female empowerment award.

18:28.254 --> 18:30.856
Please put your hands
together for mr. Ron swanson.

18:41.733 --> 18:44.434
Thank you, thank you.

18:44.501 --> 18:47.737
Every award from
the smallest trophy

18:47.805 --> 18:50.172
To the nobel prize

18:50.240 --> 18:53.942
Is nothing more than...

18:59.480 --> 19:01.548
Is nothing more than a great way

19:01.616 --> 19:03.183
To honor someone.

19:03.251 --> 19:05.319
So I would like to
present this year's

19:05.386 --> 19:08.054
Dottie english whatever award

19:08.122 --> 19:10.856
To the person who
actually deserves it.

19:10.924 --> 19:12.991
Leslie knope.
Come on up here, leslie.

19:18.898 --> 19:20.064
Thank you.

19:20.132 --> 19:22.400
I don't know what to say.

19:22.468 --> 19:25.102
Um, honestly, I'm just very honored

19:25.170 --> 19:27.137
To work for someone
as insightful and kind

19:27.205 --> 19:29.339
As my boss.

19:29.407 --> 19:32.442
So I would like to
present this year's

19:32.509 --> 19:34.710
Dorothy everton smythe award

19:34.778 --> 19:39.447
To ron swanson.

19:39.515 --> 19:42.349
I don't want it.
Just take the damn thing.

19:42.417 --> 19:43.484
- You deserve it.
- No, no, really.

19:43.551 --> 19:44.752
No, ron, you deserve it.

19:44.819 --> 19:45.919
Really, but I don't want it.

19:45.987 --> 19:47.253
But you won it,
and you should win it.

19:47.321 --> 19:49.054
After that whole conversation--

19:49.122 --> 19:50.255
- I'm being ridiculous.
- If you don't--

19:50.323 --> 19:51.423
Could someone please just take it?

19:51.490 --> 19:52.657
Okay, I'll take it.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.092
Who do I speak to about
getting this changed?

19:54.159 --> 19:55.593
Get off the stage.

19:55.661 --> 19:59.030
I still think awards are stupid.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.531
But they'd be less
stupid if they went to

20:00.599 --> 20:03.601
The right people.

20:07.438 --> 20:09.139
You gave tom all your money?

20:09.207 --> 20:11.274
Yeah. Well, I'm investing.

20:11.342 --> 20:13.710
I'm like warren "buffay."

20:13.778 --> 20:15.044
I kind of feel like
it would have been

20:15.112 --> 20:16.379
Good for you to
have your own place.

20:16.447 --> 20:18.014
Ah, yeah, I know.

20:18.081 --> 20:22.017
But I feel like tom
really needed the money.

20:22.085 --> 20:23.985
And small sacrifice to see
one of your best friend's

20:24.053 --> 20:26.921
Dreams come true.

20:30.092 --> 20:31.192
They cropped you out.

20:31.259 --> 20:32.560
Figures.

20:32.628 --> 20:34.928
So where are you gonna put it?

20:34.996 --> 20:36.230
Uh, I have an idea.

20:36.298 --> 20:38.265
One...

20:38.333 --> 20:41.335
Two, three.

20:55.909 --> 20:56.909
What's up?

20:56.976 --> 20:58.409
Hey, guys. How long
did you wait in line?

20:58.477 --> 21:00.044
I didn't wait at all.
I'm a part owner.

21:00.111 --> 21:02.445
Freddy. I'm back.

21:02.512 --> 21:03.979

21:04.047 --> 21:05.747

21:05.815 --> 21:07.381

for me every night.

21:07.449 --> 21:08.950

21:11.019 --> 21:14.953
Yes, sir.

21:15.021 --> 21:17.088
