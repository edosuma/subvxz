You are not going to believe

01:25.251 --> 01:26.587
the vacation
I’ve planned for us.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.254
And it’s well within our budget.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.456
Wait here.
I’ll get the brochure.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.458
You are going to love it!

01:37.297 --> 01:39.600
‐We’re not going.
‐Why not?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.134
When Larry comes back,
you’re just gonna have

01:41.167 --> 01:42.302
to tell him we’re not going.

01:42.335 --> 01:43.604
Where is it we’re not going?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.238
It doesn’t matter,
if Larry planned it,

01:45.271 --> 01:46.272
we’re not going.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.510
Now, ladies, listen to me.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.312
I know that in the past,
Cousin Larry’s trips

01:52.345 --> 01:53.914
have proved a little
life‐threatening

01:53.947 --> 01:56.917
but this time, things
are going to be different.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.486
Now, I‐I‐I took a peek
at the travel brochure

02:00.521 --> 02:03.223
and just between you and me

02:03.256 --> 02:06.226
I think I can safely say
that this time

02:06.259 --> 02:08.695
everything’s coming up noses.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.366
Balki, I still haven’t
gotten my luggage back

02:13.399 --> 02:14.635
from our last trip

02:16.503 --> 02:18.639
Come on, now. Come on.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.507
Cousin Larry wants
more than anything

02:20.541 --> 02:22.576
for you to have a good time.

He‐He’s trying to
make up for his past mistakes.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.882
Balki, we know
his intentions are good

02:28.915 --> 02:31.451
but that’s when
he’s the most dangerous.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.622
Well, maybe we should
give Larry another chance.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.223
I mean, after all,

02:37.257 --> 02:39.593
he did pay all of
our medical bills last time.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.898
Well, my‐my tetanus shot
is up to date, so...

02:46.667 --> 02:48.502
‐Why not?
‐Great.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.536
Thank you.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.306
Now, everything is set.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.743
We are going to paradise.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.245
Well, if we all follow
the golden rule,

02:59.279 --> 03:00.280
I don’t know why not.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.385
We are going to Club Paradise.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.287
It’s‐it’s a small resort island

03:07.320 --> 03:10.557
tucked away in the warm waters
of the Gulf of Mexico.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.559
‐Great. We’ll go.
‐Now, just hear me out.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.295
Because, it’s
got sunshine, beaches‐‐

03:15.328 --> 03:16.362
Sounds wonderful.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.430
Now I know I’ve messed up before

03:17.463 --> 03:18.999
but just give it a chance.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.433
It’s got great shopping...

03:20.466 --> 03:21.802
‐Cousin. Cousin‐‐
‐...great food.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.704
‐Entertainment. What?
‐Cousin.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.672
I‐I think they’re saying yes.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.841
They are?

03:29.309 --> 03:31.311
Well, that’s great!

03:31.344 --> 03:32.813
I told you
there’d be no problem.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.452
[upbeat saxophone music playing]

03:55.602 --> 03:57.738
Well, here we are, Mr. Appleton.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.040
Hope you enjoy yourselves.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.307
Someone will be right with you.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.814
Well, didn’t I tell you this
was a great vacation package?

04:07.848 --> 04:10.551
With free transportation
from the airport.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.653
Larry, it was a mule cart.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.957
I don’t believe this place.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.858
I don’t believe it, either.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.694
This is nicer
than The Howell’s Hut

04:20.726 --> 04:21.827
in Gilligan’s Island.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.800
Now, come on.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.636
It’s‐it’s island. It’s native.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.804
It’s falling apart.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.775
I love this place.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.343

of decayed elegance.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.178
Fabulous.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.448
Jennifer,
it’s‐it’s got character.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.718
Besides, we’ll be spending most
of our time on the beach anyhow.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.419
Come on, let‐let’s check in.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.521
Oh, Cousin! Cousin!

04:47.554 --> 04:49.489
Can I, can I? Can I...

04:49.523 --> 04:50.591
ring the bell?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.060
Okay, you ring the bell.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.296
[bell ringing]

04:57.864 --> 04:59.399

Welcome to Club Paradise.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.878
Well, we’re delighted
to have you.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.414
I’ll just get someone
to help you with your bags.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.849
[ringing bell] Front!

05:19.886 --> 05:20.887
Just follow me.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.826

here, you know.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.095
Well, here are your keys.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.065
And, uh, I just hope
that you have

05:32.098 --> 05:34.034
a wonderful weekend in paradise.

05:37.070 --> 05:37.904
Well, thanks, Mac.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.107
Well, what do you say
we take a swim,

05:41.141 --> 05:44.410
go into town,
and shop till we drop?

05:44.444 --> 05:46.613
Okay, we’ll change
and meet you in the lobby.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.538
Boy, these walls are thin.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.677
It sounds like Mary Anne

06:16.710 --> 06:18.444
is right here
in the room with us.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.459
Boy, these walls
really are thin.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.998
I can see through them.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.168
I wonder if they can see us.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.146
No, they can’t.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.518
‐Balki...
‐Aah!

06:59.653 --> 07:01.855
What are you doing in our room?

07:01.888 --> 07:03.957
Well, we’re not in your room.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.192
This is our room, I‐I think.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.061
No.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.462
Well, let’s see.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.634
[Larry]
We’re in 101. You’re in 102.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.141
Wow.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.978
This room is nicer than ours.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.551
‐Balki.
‐Yes.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.718
This is the same room.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.688
Well, I’ll be snookered.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.024
Well, Cousin, this is great.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.995
Now when you call out
Jennifer’s name in your sleep

07:42.028 --> 07:43.163
she’ll be right here.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.104
Uh, L‐Larry,
this is not going to work.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.906
No problem,
I’ll‐I’ll call the desk

07:52.939 --> 07:55.075
and‐and get this
all straightened out.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.144
Ask them to send up another bed.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.113
And another wall.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.617
Hello, Mac?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.285
Yeah, this‐this is
Larry Appleton.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.755
Yeah, listen, we‐we only have,
uh, one room

08:08.789 --> 08:10.691
and we did pay for two.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.158
Simple math would tell us

08:12.192 --> 08:15.228
that, uh, we’re exactly
one room short.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.897
Yeah, you‐you get my point?

08:17.631 --> 08:18.632
Uh‐huh.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.602
I see.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.136
Well, let me get back
to you on that.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.073
What did he say?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.110
Well, there are two other rooms.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.712
Uh, one is a little flooded

08:33.679 --> 08:34.548
and the other has snakes.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.917
‐[gasping]
‐But they’re not poisonous.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.820
He said, we could take our pick.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.123
Well, Cousin, what kind of fool
would want a flooded room?

08:43.155 --> 08:44.256
We’ll take the snakes.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.163
Larry, you did it to us again.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.033
Now, let’s get our money back
and get out of here, now.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.835
Hey, there’s just
a little problem

08:54.868 --> 08:56.069
with the accommodations.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.804
I’ll work it out with Mac.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.773
Hey, this place
is gonna look great

08:59.806 --> 09:02.342
from the other side of a suntan.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.645
This is the worst vacation
I’ve had with you

09:04.678 --> 09:06.913
since the last worst vacation
I’ve had with you.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.985
[door closing]

09:12.018 --> 09:13.286
I better go talk to her.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.926
What’s with her?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.930
Cousin, um...

09:24.698 --> 09:27.000
call it intuition,

09:27.033 --> 09:29.369
call it common sense,

09:29.402 --> 09:31.337
call the wind Mariah,

09:31.371 --> 09:33.807
but I, uh...

09:33.840 --> 09:36.376
I‐I‐I don’t think
the girls are happy here

09:36.409 --> 09:39.112
so even though I love it

09:39.145 --> 09:40.747
I‐I think we should leave.

09:41.848 --> 09:45.218
Balki, I have put
a lot of thought

09:45.251 --> 09:46.820
and planning into this vacation.

09:46.853 --> 09:50.056
‐I know that, Cousin.
‐I need your support here!

09:50.090 --> 09:52.225
Now after we get
this room thing worked out,

09:52.258 --> 09:54.695
I’m sure the girls
will come around.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.630
[both screaming] Aah!

09:56.663 --> 09:58.899
There’s a, there’s a,
a thing in the bathtub!

09:58.932 --> 10:02.035
R‐r‐relax. Just relax.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.070
In tropical climates
you’ve got to expect

10:04.104 --> 10:06.039
the occasional insect or bug.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.610
Now, whatever it is...

10:10.310 --> 10:12.012
I’ll take care of it.

10:18.685 --> 10:19.820
[Larry screaming] Aah‐aah!

10:25.792 --> 10:27.093
What is it, Cousin?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.095
Well, it’s either a spider,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.932
or a very hairy Volkswagen.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.912
‐Okay, my turn.
‐Okay, okay.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.014
Aah!

10:48.048 --> 10:50.316
Okay, okay, my turn.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.890
Ow. Ow. Ow!

10:56.923 --> 10:57.924
Ow.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.660
Aah!

11:02.963 --> 11:06.366
Cousin, I‐I‐I know we’re having
the time of our lives

11:06.399 --> 11:09.435
but I‐I don’t think the girls

11:09.469 --> 11:12.472
quite share our enthusiasm
for this place.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.107
What are you talking about?
The girls are having

11:14.140 --> 11:15.175
a wonderful time.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.144
Larry, I hate this place.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.414
There is no swimming pool,
no golf course,

11:21.447 --> 11:24.284
and you have to rappel down
a cliff to get to the beach.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.254
And I don’t know why we bothered
to get all dressed up.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.355
There’s nothing to do.

11:29.389 --> 11:33.026
Well, that amusement park
next door looked like fun.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.460
Balki, that isn’t
an amusement park.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.762
That’s a refinery.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.367
Okay. Okay.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.904
You wanna leave? We’ll leave.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.772
[spraying]

11:51.011 --> 11:52.012
Mosquitoes.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.347
Watch out for the dead ones.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.481
You could turn an ankle.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.990
[Larry] Mac.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.959
What time does the plane
leave for the mainland?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.394
Uh, twenty minutes ago,

12:08.428 --> 12:09.462
but there’s
another one tomorrow.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.768
All right, we can
leave tomorrow.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.369
In the meantime, let’s just try

12:16.402 --> 12:19.105
to enjoy the time
we’ve got here.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.408
You know, I think we’re all
experiencing a sugar low.

12:22.442 --> 12:26.012
Why we don’t go into town
and sample the island cuisine?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.981
Now that’s the spirit, Balki.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.016
Mac...

12:30.050 --> 12:32.519
Uh, can you recommend
a good restaurant on the island?

12:33.486 --> 12:34.487
Oh, I sure could.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.394
Welcome to Chez Mac.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.897
Oh.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.933
Do you have reservations?

12:46.967 --> 12:51.071
Mac, this is a good restaurant?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.407
Well, this is
the, uh, the only restaurant.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.243
We did have a little Tex‐Mex
place on the North Beach

12:57.277 --> 12:59.012
but it went under last week.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.281
Went out of business?

13:01.314 --> 13:02.849
No, it really went under.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.285
It sank.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.020
We got sink holes
all over the island.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.254
[laughing]

13:11.257 --> 13:14.160
W‐w‐why don’t we just,
uh, eat here?

13:14.194 --> 13:16.196
I’ve‐I’ve got
a good feeling about it.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.964
You do?

13:17.998 --> 13:19.232
Well, let’s eat here anyway.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.440
Hi. My name’s Mac.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.909
I’ll be your waiter
this evening.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.245
The specials are on the house

13:32.278 --> 13:34.247
but I will need
the little umbrellas back.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.956
Well, now this is nice, huh?

13:44.224 --> 13:46.927
This is what it’s all about.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.495
This is why I get up
in the morning, this is why‐‐

13:49.530 --> 13:51.297
Put a sock in it, Larry.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.503
Cousin, um...

13:56.537 --> 13:58.905
could‐could‐could I have
a private word with you?

14:01.942 --> 14:02.943
Excuse us.

14:05.646 --> 14:06.913
Oh...

14:10.984 --> 14:13.319
This story is about

14:13.353 --> 14:16.957
the most pigheaded pig farmer

14:16.990 --> 14:18.058
on Mypos.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.460
Oinki.

14:22.563 --> 14:24.397
One day, Oinki thought

14:24.430 --> 14:27.901
he had made the deal
of his life on a prize pig.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.202
Only, when he got it home

14:29.235 --> 14:32.038
he discovered that
it wasn’t a pig at all.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.007
It was a dog in pig’s clothing.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.078
His family was going hungry

14:38.111 --> 14:39.379
because there was no bacon.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.414
But Oinki was stubborn.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.150
Even when his pig chased cars,

14:44.184 --> 14:46.086
buried bones,
and bit the mailman,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.321
he refused to admit
he’d made a mistake.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.057
Oinki’s family

14:51.091 --> 14:54.160
finally left him on
the day his pig had puppies.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.502
Because of his stubbornness,

15:01.535 --> 15:04.104
he had to spend
the rest of his days alone.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.206
What’s your point?

15:08.308 --> 15:11.311
No matter what face
you put on this hotel,

15:11.344 --> 15:12.679
it’s still a dog.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.019
Now, Cousin, your pigheadedness

15:19.052 --> 15:20.521
is costing you your friends.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.424
I wanted so badly
for‐for Jennifer

15:24.457 --> 15:25.959
‐to enjoy this trip.
‐Yes.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.093
I thought
this would be my chance...

15:27.127 --> 15:28.562
Cousin‐Cousin‐Cousin,

15:29.262 --> 15:30.263
it’s over.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.380
All right, I booked us
on a trip to hell.

15:50.316 --> 15:51.451
I’m sorry.

15:52.553 --> 15:54.655
We can leave
on the plane tomorrow.

15:54.688 --> 15:58.258
And I promise never to plan
another vacation again.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.362
Well, I guess we can
make it through one night.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.731
Yeah, it’s not the end
of the world.

16:04.765 --> 16:09.202
Well, at least we can
spend a quiet evening

16:09.235 --> 16:11.505
and enjoy the peaceful solitude

16:11.538 --> 16:13.640
of a tropical island.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.309
[wind gusting]

16:17.343 --> 16:19.412
[crashing]

16:22.415 --> 16:24.551
Sorry. The kitchen’s closed.

16:24.585 --> 16:26.720
We just sat down.
How can it be closed?

16:26.753 --> 16:29.022
Okay, it’s not closed.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.190
It’s gone.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.694
Things like that
happen in a hurricane.

16:34.628 --> 16:36.697
[girls] Hurricane!

16:36.730 --> 16:40.066
Don’t panic. I’ve been through
hurricanes on Mypos.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.436
The first thing we have
to do is find the sheep!

16:46.840 --> 16:48.509
[girls] Ow! Ow.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.253
[thunder rumbling]

17:09.863 --> 17:11.064
Oh!

17:11.396 --> 17:12.432
Whoa!

17:12.866 --> 17:14.067
Aah!

17:18.539 --> 17:19.705
[Mary Anne] I can’t get up!

17:20.874 --> 17:22.142
‐Balki!
‐[Jennifer] Balki!

17:36.723 --> 17:38.659
[thunder rumbling]

17:59.479 --> 18:02.182
All right.
We’ll be fine in here.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.850
I think we’ve seen
the worst of it.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.453
Mary Anne, if I die,

18:07.487 --> 18:10.290
I want you to have
my‐my Wayne Newton albums.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.093
Thanks, Balki.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.529
Jennifer, if I die,

18:15.562 --> 18:17.130
I want you
to have all of my clothes

18:17.163 --> 18:18.665
and Balki’s Wayne Newton albums.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.367
Thank you, Mary Anne.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.169
And Larry...

18:24.437 --> 18:25.471
if I die...

18:27.508 --> 18:29.209
I’m taking you with me.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.545
Now‐now wait a minute.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.380
What‐what is all
this talk about death?

18:34.414 --> 18:35.882
We are going to be fine.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.651
These tropical storms
pass quickly.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.521
They blow,
and then they’re gone.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.689
[both screaming]

18:45.291 --> 18:46.693
[Jennifer] Balki, do something!

18:46.727 --> 18:47.694
We’ve got to...

18:47.728 --> 18:50.631
We’ve got to stick
something in the window

18:50.664 --> 18:52.566
to block the wind.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.167
The mattress.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.403
We’ll cover the window
with the mattress.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.523
[together] Whoa.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.763
Bathroom!

19:22.796 --> 19:24.531
Oh, Cousin, you should
have thought of that

19:24.565 --> 19:25.799
before the hurricane!

19:27.601 --> 19:31.638
I mean, let’s take cover
in the bathroom.

19:31.672 --> 19:32.673
Oh.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.180
[grunting and groaning]

19:40.647 --> 19:41.882
Follow me!

20:00.567 --> 20:01.868
Good news.

20:01.902 --> 20:03.537
The spider’s gone.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.308
Oh, oh. Oh...

20:08.341 --> 20:09.710
[together] Oh.

20:09.743 --> 20:11.745
[screaming]

20:20.386 --> 20:22.789
[yelling] Balki! Balki!

20:24.290 --> 20:26.326
Balki! Help me!

20:26.927 --> 20:29.830
‐Balki!
‐Cousin!

20:33.433 --> 20:34.835
Aah!

20:38.839 --> 20:40.607
[together] Oh, Balki!

20:48.949 --> 20:50.250
[thud]

20:53.620 --> 20:54.821
‐Are you okay?
‐Yeah.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.525
I‐I think we’ve finally

20:58.559 --> 20:59.793
seen the worst of it.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.029
[Mary Anne] No.

21:04.064 --> 21:06.032
[all screaming]

21:08.101 --> 21:09.636
Cousin.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.337
Cousin, look.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.273
You can see
the refinery from here.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.414
[upbeat saxophone music playing]

21:36.530 --> 21:38.899
Cousin, you know
what the best thing

21:38.932 --> 21:40.967
about going away
on vacation with you is?

21:41.001 --> 21:42.435
No, Balki, what’s that?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.338
Coming back home alive.

21:46.907 --> 21:49.576
I‐I just love it.

21:52.813 --> 21:53.880
You know...

21:55.649 --> 21:58.418
I think I’m gonna
take a vacation

21:58.451 --> 22:00.554
from planning vacations.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.955
Oh, Cousin,
you don’t have to do that.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.124
‐I don’t? No?
‐No.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.859
When the girls
and I were pulling you

22:05.892 --> 22:06.993
out of that sink hole,

22:07.027 --> 22:09.963
we decided to never let you
plan a trip again anyway.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.035
I’m sorry for ruining
the entire weekend.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.838
Oh, come on, Cousin, it wasn’t
a complete waste of time.

22:17.871 --> 22:19.072
I got some neat souvenirs.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.409
Oh, you didn’t buy one of those
visors from Mac, did you?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.846
Well, of course not.
Don’t be ridiculous.

22:26.813 --> 22:27.914
But...

22:30.416 --> 22:32.953
Remember that spider
we saw in the bathroom?

22:42.696 --> 22:44.931
[theme music playing]
