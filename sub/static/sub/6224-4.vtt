00:03.504 --> 00:05.790
Narrator: In a land of myth
and a time of magic...

00:06.006 --> 00:07.962
The destiny of a great kingdom

00:08.175 --> 00:11.008
rests on the shoulders
of a young man.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.053
His name: Merlin.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.285
King rodor.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.170
Princess mithian.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.508
You are as beautiful
as they say.

00:55.556 --> 00:59.970
- You, Odin, are a cold-blooded murderer.
- Why have you done this?

01:00.936 --> 01:03.143
You should choose
your allies more carefully.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.686
Any friend of Camelot
is an enemy of mine.

01:19.705 --> 01:23.072
So we divide the spoils as agreed.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.206
Take whatever you wish.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.786
Then what is your
business here, morgana?

01:29.715 --> 01:32.081
I seek what's rightfully mine.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.668
I seek the throne of Camelot.
And for that, I need an army.

01:35.887 --> 01:36.967
My army?

01:37.848 --> 01:40.089
I believe they showed
their mettle today.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.345
And what do I receive
in return for this service?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.558
Arthur.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.687
To do with as you wish.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.588
Show yourselves.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.718
Sir Leon.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.258
It gladdens my heart to see you.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.472
Princess mithian.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.304
My lady.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.856
Quickly. You must get us to Gaius.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.317
Gaius:
Merlin, bring blankets and build a fire.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.615
Hurry now.
We must keep her warm at all costs.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.947
Leon: Will she be all right?

03:23.120 --> 03:24.656
I feel it's too early to say.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.787
Thank you, Leon. You've done all you can.
“Of course.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.534
I'll have someone
show you to your room.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.837
- I will not leave my mistress.
Merlin: She is in safe hands, I assure you.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.585
Hilda:
She means everything to me.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.336
If it were up to me...

03:39.553 --> 03:42.010
Please. Gaius?

03:43.265 --> 03:47.304
Very well. Make yourself comfortable.
Merlin, give me a blanket.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.024
Yes?

04:01.116 --> 04:03.436
- How is she?
- She is weak, and she's clearly exhausted...

04:03.618 --> 04:05.825
- But she will live.
- Good.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.528
- I will speak to her at once.
- Actually, no.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.909
- Excuse me?
- She's not to be disturbed until morning.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.539
- This is important.
- And so is the health of the Princess.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.584
- Did you just give me an order?
- Yes, sire.

04:17.798 --> 04:21.212
- Feel good, does it?
- It's not unpleasant.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.175
Arthur?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.811
To ride all through the night...

04:34.232 --> 04:35.722
Something must have happened.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.735
We'll know more in the morning. I'm sure.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.121
Your magic may be strong, morgana...

05:41.341 --> 05:44.083
But you can't keep this up for long.
It's exhausting you.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.337
Enough.

05:53.061 --> 05:57.145
You just concentrate on making sure
your friends believe your story.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.314
They came at night...

06:04.573 --> 06:06.484
Without warning.

06:09.744 --> 06:13.077
We were unprepared.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.780
We could not hold them.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.833
This was three days ago, you say?

06:22.966 --> 06:24.672
His men.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.676
They showed no mercy.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.839
He cut us down like.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.093
Corn.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.644
Odin has no care
for the suffering he causes.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.521
- And your father?
- He was badly wounded.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.482
But we managed to escape.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.321
Where is he now? Mithian: We made
it almost as far as the border.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.077
But he could not continue any further.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.665
Odin's men will be searching for us.

06:58.877 --> 07:02.165
It's only a matter of time
before they find him.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.171
I see.

07:13.516 --> 07:17.054
My father is an old man.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.263
He cannot fend for himself.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.945
I have no one else
to turn to but you, Arthur.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.860
You're my only hope.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.464
Mithian, I understand
how you must be feeling...

07:48.301 --> 07:51.338
And I will do everything
in my power to help you.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.342
Thank you, my lord.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.226
Rodor has taken refuge here...

08:04.442 --> 08:07.184
At the ancient tomb of king lother
three leagues from our border.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.737
- Mithian can lead us there?
- She's recovering well.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.861
Now, our only chance of getting rodor back
is with speed and stealth...

08:14.077 --> 08:15.597
With just a small group of knights.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.903
Could be over the border
and back again in hours.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.488
- Exactly.
- Sire, if I may.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.120
- Yes, Gaius?
Gaius: Odin has long been after your blood.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.577
If he finds out about this, you could
have an entire army at your backs.

08:25.797 --> 08:29.381
That's true. But Odin doesn't know
where rodor is and we do.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.759
By the time he's realized
what's happened we'll be long gone.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.506
Now we'll camp overnight
in the forests of gedref

08:37.726 --> 08:39.432
and leave with the rising sun.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.750
I'm sorry. I did knock.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.412
Hilda: No need to apologize.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.340
Gaius sent me.
I have a draft for the Princess.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.255
Hilda: How thoughtful.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.926
Thank you, Merlin.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.550
Goodnight, then.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.944
I would not test me if I were you.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.903
You would not enjoy the consequences.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.341
You've got something
on your mind, Merlin?

10:37.095 --> 10:41.680
I don't know. There's something
not quite right with mithian.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.135
Should I go and see her?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.933
No, it's not like that. It's not unwell.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.354
- It's as if she's frightened of something.
- Well, she's worried, Merlin.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.806
She's worried about her father.
It's only to be expected.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.860
It's more than that. I can see fear
in her eyes. It's not the mithian I know.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.734
The mithian you knew
was here in happier times.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.408
It's not just mithian. It's hilda.
There's something not right between them.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.077
They've both been through
a terrible ordeal, Merlin.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.202
They've fled their home.
Barely escaped with their lives.

11:08.418 --> 11:12.286
It's not surprising
that the strain has taken its toll.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.665
Maybe.

11:16.092 --> 11:20.461
Come on. We have work to do.
We must pack up our supplies.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.471
Arthur, why have you
agreed to help mithian?

11:32.150 --> 11:34.436
Because nemeth is our ally.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.820
One small slip and Camelot
could find itself without a king.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.239
That's a risk I'm prepared to take.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.068
For nemeth or for yourself?

11:49.375 --> 11:53.744
- What do you mean, for myself?
- It was Odin who took your father's life.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.125
You can't deny that you've
been waiting for a chance to retaliate.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.714
Whatever I feel about Odin
has nothing to do with this.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.012
- Really?
- Absolutely not.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.515
This is about helping
our friends. No more. No less.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.727
Good. I just wanted to be sure.

12:12.982 --> 12:17.851
Well, you were right to ask. I rely on your
honesty, Guinevere. And I love you for it.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.126
Seems your daughter is not
just a pretty face, rodor.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.133
Arthur is preparing to depart Camelot.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.889
Tell the men to make ready.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.770
The tomb of a king.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.814
A fitting end to Arthur's journey...

12:57.026 --> 12:58.061
Don't you think?

12:58.444 --> 13:01.356
You lead an honorable man
to his death, Odin.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.779
You're no king.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.782
You're little more than
a common criminal

13:12.125 --> 13:15.492
Arthur is the criminal

13:15.795 --> 13:19.754
he proved that when
he murdered my son.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.108
No

15:19.919 --> 15:22.205
- Looking for someone?
- No, I was just...

15:27.301 --> 15:29.181
Did you really imagine
you could go to Arthur...

15:29.387 --> 15:32.595
Behind my back? You're mistaken.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.555
- I was just...
- If you betray me again...

15:34.767 --> 15:36.223
I'll bury your father alive.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.552
Understand? Yes.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.354
Yes. Please, make it stop.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.694
- Is everything all right?
- Get up.

15:48.906 --> 15:49.941
Slowly.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.527
The Princess was feeling
a little faint, that's all.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.655
We were just getting some air.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.495
Well, I hope you're feeling better now.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.960
Much better. Thank you.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.834
We won't detain you
any further, my lady.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.248
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.713
Gwen: Sleep well.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.021
Sire”? Wait.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.941
- What is it?
- This mission, sire...

16:28.154 --> 16:31.567
- Is too dangerous, so I shouldn't go.
- Yeah. You're thinking the same thing?

16:31.782 --> 16:34.068
No. I'm thinking
that's exactly what you always say.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.823
But here I am.
Two legs, two arms, my own teeth.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.618
I've got a funny feeling
that there's something we're missing.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.577
- Something we don't know.
- But you can't say what exactly?

16:45.796 --> 16:47.036
Eee ee -

16:47.256 --> 16:48.746
maybe we should delay the mission...

16:48.966 --> 16:51.628
Until we have all the facts
at our disposal.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.132
Fine. Oh, go and tell Princess mithian...

16:55.348 --> 16:58.556
That we've decided to let her father die
because you have a funny feeling.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.135
I didn't think so.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.703
How did you get that?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.576
I was bound by Odin's men...

18:09.088 --> 18:12.330
- Before I escaped.
- I'm sorry.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.624
I didn't realize that

18:16.429 --> 18:17.919
hilda:
It's a very painful memory.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.339
I'm sure she'd rather not dwell on it.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.641
Of course. I understand.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.616
Doesn't make sense.
Mithian told Arthur that she had escaped.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.588
She never said anything
about being captured.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.324
She was in shock, Merlin.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.184
Sir, that's quite an important detail
to leave out of your story.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.788
- Why would she lie”?
- Because

18:50.004 --> 18:52.444
she didn't want me to know
how she got that burn on her wrist.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.044
Gaius, there's something not right here.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.923
Have to reach the border by nightfall.
Let's move out.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.473
Merlin: Arthur.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.848
Are you sure this is
the right thing to be doing?

19:56.237 --> 19:59.525
Ah. Your funny feeling again, is it?

20:01.075 --> 20:02.656
Something like that.

20:02.868 --> 20:07.737
- Have you been talking to Guinevere?
- No. Why do you ask?

20:08.708 --> 20:12.667
Did she have doubts
about you rescuing rodor?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.838
Odin is a plague on this land.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.291
Can't just stand by
and let him murder mithian's father

20:20.511 --> 20:23.378
- as he murdered my own.
- I know what he did.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.134
God knows I understand
why you hate him.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.969
But to risk so much
for one small act of revenge.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.690
Tell me, Merlin.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.352
If you were me,
if you were in my shoes...

20:42.366 --> 20:44.277
Would you do any different?

20:48.456 --> 20:51.323
Probably not.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.221
(Saius!

21:09.393 --> 21:10.849
Gaius: All right.

21:12.563 --> 21:15.680
Just breathe in. That's it.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.390
I'm fine.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.850
Of course.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.934
I just want to be sure all the same.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.067
Oh. That's really not necessary.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.490
Hilda, if you're unwell,
you must let Gaius help you.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.533
Only if you insist.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.019
Well, no obvious problems
that I can find.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.064
You're in excellent health, hilda.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.199
Thank you, Gaius.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.948
In better shape than me at any rate.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.171
Merlin, it's amazing.

22:23.384 --> 22:24.920
Her blood.

22:25.135 --> 22:28.753
It flows with the strength
and vigor of someone half her age.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.056
How is that possible?

22:33.561 --> 22:35.176
I'm not entirely sure.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.956
All I know is she's better preserved...

22:37.147 --> 22:40.605
Than anyone her age has any right to be.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.748
Going somewhere?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.247
I need to wash.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.628
Do I need to remind you
what fate awaits your father...

23:07.845 --> 23:09.460
Should you try anything foolish?

23:09.680 --> 23:12.422
I need to wash that's all

23:15.603 --> 23:16.934
don't be long.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.230
Leon: Sire?

23:30.784 --> 23:33.366
- Have the outriders returned?
- Yes, sire.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.197
They report large numbers of Odin's men
patrolling just beyond the border.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.906
They're looking for rodor.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.366
Sir, we have but few.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.826
If we're seen, there'll be no escape. Would
it not be wise to remain here until...

23:43.964 --> 23:46.580
Out of the question.
Time's a luxury we don't have.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.960
But we have good cover.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.884
With any luck, the patrols
will pass us by soon enough, and...

23:51.096 --> 23:54.759
We press on for nemeth.
Make ready to depart.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.103
Princess

24:05.319 --> 24:08.811
- good morning, Merlin.
- Can I help you with something?

24:09.031 --> 24:11.022
I hope so.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.952
I need this refilling, please.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.911
No need. Here have mine.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.875
I'd prefer my own if you don't mind.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.506
Not at all

24:34.473 --> 24:36.179
thank you.

25:40.581 --> 25:41.991
Leon: Merlin?

25:42.416 --> 25:43.781
Herel

25:44.334 --> 25:45.619
he's here.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.671
- What happened?
- Hilda found him.

25:54.970 --> 25:58.087
He was down by the river.
He must have fallen.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.923
- Gaius?
- He's taken a heavy blow to the head.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.724
But he'll be all right?

26:03.062 --> 26:06.975
He should be fine, sire. But there's
no telling when he'll regain consciousness.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.445
We can't wait for him.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.529
Not if we're to stand a chance
of reaching rodor before Odin's men.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.279
Gwaine? You stay here
with Merlin and Gaius.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.160
The rest of us make for nemeth.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.308
I warned you there'd be consequences
if you tried anything.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.184
He should have come around by now.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.863
It's unusual, certainly.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.903
Just a blow to the head, you say?

27:00.119 --> 27:03.111
There's nothing to suggest anything more.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.243
On the outside at least

27:08.627 --> 27:12.586
- he's getting cold. Better get more firewood.
- I'll be right back.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.158
The tomb lies just east of the river.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.326
This is Odin's land now.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.077
So stay alert.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.251
Come on, Merlin.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.436
Please, Merlin.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.894
That's all I have.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.320
Let it be enough.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.415
Merlin

28:41.136 --> 28:42.842
(saius.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.476
Hilda. It's morgana.

28:51.688 --> 28:52.723
Morgana?

28:52.940 --> 28:55.522
She's been using some kind of aging spell.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.067
That explains why she's always so tired.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.884
Mithian tried to warn me,
but I couldn't get to Arthur in time.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.907
- Morgana got to me first.
- Yes, and very nearly killed you, Merlin.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.483
Yes

29:08.956 --> 29:12.244
she didn't count on
a sorcerer of your power now did she?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.666
Indeed. But please, Merlin.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.912
Don't make me do that again.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.334
I'm not sure my heart can take lit.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.505
Merlin!

29:27.140 --> 29:31.008
We need to get to Arthur.
He walking straight into a trap.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.603
You sure of the way?

29:39.820 --> 29:41.936
Yes we're not far now.

29:42.155 --> 29:45.647
If we keep heading east,
the tomb lies just ahead.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.329
They're traveling east.
Maybe an hour ahead of us.

29:56.545 --> 29:57.785
We don't have that much time.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.554
Is that it? Mithian: Yes.

30:10.267 --> 30:14.260
- We should find my father inside.
- Let's go then.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.730
Hey, hey. This way.

30:33.915 --> 30:37.123
Leon, elyan, stand watch with the others.
Percival, you're with me.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.644
The burial chamber lies just ahead.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.064
The end of that tunnel.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.766
Odin's men.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.869
I don't understand. Where's your father?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.501
He's not here.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.006
Then where is he”?

32:09.219 --> 32:10.709
Arthur, I...

33:04.733 --> 33:06.098
What wrong have I done you?

33:14.618 --> 33:17.530
Arthur pendragon. At last.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.078
I've waited many years for this moment.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.575
You killed my son.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.248
You took what was
most precious from me.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.958
And now you will pay the forfeit.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.509
Woman:
And not a moment too soon.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.513
You are not alone in having waited
for this moment, Odin.

33:41.311 --> 33:44.098
Appearances can be
deceiving, dear brother.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.897
Morgana.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.113
And now you will pay the forfeit.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.365
My father's life.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.242
That wasn't enough?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.198
No

34:11.382 --> 34:12.418
So be it

34:15.011 --> 34:17.217
but understand this, Odin.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.632
You kill me.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.965
And you'll have all
of Camelot to answer to.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.551
Camelot is nothing without its king.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.308
Then you don't know my knights.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.099
They will hunt you.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.147
And they will find you.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.150
And they will not rest until they're done.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.487
I will deal with
your knights soon enough.

34:40.704 --> 34:44.288
But now, your time has come.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.123
Gwaine: We're too late.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.417
Merlin: Not if we even out
the numbers.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.132
Sounds good to me.
“I'll look for Arthur.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.467
(Ood luck.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.885
- Merlin?
- Hurry, this way!

36:46.913 --> 36:47.948
Now!

37:12.230 --> 37:13.390
This way.

37:28.121 --> 37:30.828
Don't look so surprised.
I commanded an army in my time.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.280
And you will do so again.

37:41.801 --> 37:42.881
I eave me.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.883
- That won't happen. You're why we're here.
- I eave me. Save mithian.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.810
- Follow the Ridge line.
- What about you?

37:54.230 --> 37:56.141
We'll lead them the other way.
No.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.064
This is between me and Odin.
You need no further part.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.595
No!

38:34.813 --> 38:36.599
I want to do this myself!

39:27.657 --> 39:29.568
Merlin: Arthur! Stop.

39:31.411 --> 39:33.322
Think about what you're doing.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.403
What good will this achieve?

39:38.334 --> 39:41.292
Merlin: How many times have you talked
about uniting this land?

39:44.007 --> 39:47.340
Will killing this man
make that dream any closer?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.173
He's right.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.139
This is no answer.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.720
Finish it.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.849
- Finish it and be done.
- And what then?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.820
Your people will seek their revenge.

40:09.449 --> 40:10.939
A war without an end.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.025
- There is no other way.
- There is another way.

40:15.663 --> 40:16.994
In return for your life...

40:17.790 --> 40:20.873
You must restore rodor
to the throne of nemeth.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.667
Even if I agreed, it solves nothing.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.915
What about us, pendragon?
“A truce.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.297
Binding our kingdoms to peace.
Never.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.508
Is this what you want?

40:35.183 --> 40:39.096
To die here, now, knowing that you
condemned this land to war?

40:39.812 --> 40:43.350
Odin, you cannot let it end like this.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.267
The blood will never wash off

40:47.987 --> 40:50.194
you killed my son.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.863
You killed my father.

40:55.078 --> 40:58.286
We've both lost much at the other's hand.
Let us lose no more.

40:58.498 --> 41:01.456
I am offering you
the chance to end this.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.620
Take it

41:09.801 --> 41:11.007
Take it

41:18.101 --> 41:19.386
So be it

41:23.898 --> 41:25.229
a truce

41:26.693 --> 41:28.024
tis

41:40.123 --> 41:43.286
Your wounds are painful, sire,
but superficial.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.037
You will heal in good time.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.743
Thank you, Gaius.

41:47.463 --> 41:51.331
Odin has withdrawn his army
from nemeth and its lands.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.757
All thanks to you.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.468
Well, everyone played their part.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.425
I know I played mine.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.595
- Arthur...
- Mithian.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.268
You don't need to apologize.

42:05.732 --> 42:06.767
You had no choice.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.728
I'd have done the same,
had it been my father.

42:13.281 --> 42:16.023
Camelot is fortunate
to have a king such as you.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.949
It's I that's fortunate.

42:20.747 --> 42:26.037
Camelot would be nothing were it not for
the courage and loyalty of its friends.

42:38.347 --> 42:40.929
You could've killed Odin,
you had every reason.

42:41.142 --> 42:42.757
You did something
more important...

42:42.977 --> 42:45.559
You gave the people
of this land hope for the future.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.228
I'm proud of you.

42:47.482 --> 42:49.438
Merlin should take some of the credit

42:49.859 --> 42:51.770
turns out he's not
always entirely stupid.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.066
Is that a compliment?

42:53.279 --> 42:56.191
Don't tell him, whatever you do,
I'l never hear the end of it.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.078
It seems that things
turned out well after all

43:04.290 --> 43:06.747
to sign a treaty with Odin
is a great achievement...

43:06.959 --> 43:09.416
And it brings a United Kingdom
one step closer.

43:09.629 --> 43:12.496
Not while morgana lives and
breathes, it doesn't. It doesn't

43:14.634 --> 43:15.999
her power grows, Gaius.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.715
To have held an aging spell that long,
that's frightening.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.671
Be that as it may...

43:22.141 --> 43:24.302
She is not yet your equal.

43:28.898 --> 43:30.434
And if that day should come?

43:32.360 --> 43:34.316
Let us hope it does not.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.694
Narrator: Merlin

43:49.877 --> 43:52.710
This is the judgment
of the gods against you.

44:04.392 --> 44:05.928
Man: Merlin!
