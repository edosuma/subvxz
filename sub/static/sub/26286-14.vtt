00:02.297 --> 00:03.897
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.899 --> 00:05.899
You've always said that
you wanted to finish school.

00:05.901 --> 00:08.235
I think the time is now.

00:08.579 --> 00:11.701
Randall, it's a struggle for me
to get out of bed every morning.

00:11.930 --> 00:14.011
It takes every single ounce
of energy that I have,

00:14.013 --> 00:16.413
and then I have nothing left
for the rest of the day.

00:16.415 --> 00:17.540
Nothing.

00:17.565 --> 00:19.383
I take office in the next few weeks,

00:19.385 --> 00:20.818
and God only knows what kind of effect

00:20.820 --> 00:22.453
that's gonna have on my family.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.445
I'm ready to tell you
what I want to do next.

00:24.776 --> 00:26.203
I want to teach.

00:26.759 --> 00:29.921
Kevin is newly sober,
just like his father.

00:29.994 --> 00:31.828
And he's had a really tough year.

00:39.411 --> 00:43.296
Babe, I'm begging
you, please, just pick one.

00:44.477 --> 00:45.696
I'm gonna zoom in on that.

00:45.721 --> 00:48.157
- Did-did you just say "just pick one"?
- Stop.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.450
Jack, come on, I'm covered
in triplet spit-up. Stop.

00:51.462 --> 00:54.613
Bec, you realize that the camera
that we choose today

00:54.615 --> 00:56.982
is gonna document
the most important moments

00:56.984 --> 00:58.618
of our family's lives?

00:59.539 --> 01:01.739
You become a completely different person

01:01.741 --> 01:02.960
in this store. You know that, right?

01:02.985 --> 01:05.164
Yeah, I do. Radio Shack Jack.

01:06.579 --> 01:08.145
- Radio Shack Jack?
- Yeah.

01:08.147 --> 01:10.664
Well, maybe he can tell me
why we need a new video camera.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.022
Because the old one doesn't have sound.

01:13.336 --> 01:15.453
Okay? And there-there are
things happening

01:15.478 --> 01:18.781
in the Pearson house
that I think we should hear.

01:20.109 --> 01:21.906
Look, when we're old and gray

01:21.922 --> 01:23.671
and we don't remember
what we ate for breakfast,

01:23.696 --> 01:25.585
you're gonna be so happy
that we've got tapes

01:25.610 --> 01:28.171
of these three at their absolute cutest.

01:33.076 --> 01:34.578
Present moment excluded.

01:36.422 --> 01:37.803
- Should we... swap them?
- Yeah.

01:37.828 --> 01:38.961
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:39.729 --> 01:42.757
Come on, come on, come on.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.390
There you go, there you go.

01:49.415 --> 01:52.421
It's okay. Here, sweetie, look.
Here's your sister Kate.

01:52.499 --> 01:53.928
It's Kate right here.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.593
Hmm. Yeah.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.773
- It's crazy how they soothe each other.
- Yeah.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.413
Oh, I should've gotten that on tape.

02:05.663 --> 02:08.717
Customer needs assistance in aisle four.

02:09.088 --> 02:12.255
Customer needs assistance in aisle four.

02:19.289 --> 02:20.507
Rebecca?

02:21.023 --> 02:22.422
Hey, I thought that was you.

02:22.570 --> 02:24.584
Uh, Matt. Matt Dixon.

02:24.609 --> 02:26.029
Our kids went to middle school together?

02:26.054 --> 02:29.110
Oh. Yeah, hi, Matt.

02:29.135 --> 02:32.135
Hi. Yeah, you were the only,
uh, guy in the PTA.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.393
Yep. Yep. Comes with the
single-dad territory.

02:40.430 --> 02:41.545
You need some help?

02:41.547 --> 02:43.539
Actually, yes. Please, I...

02:43.564 --> 02:47.443
I-I need a new camera
for graduation tomorrow.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.428
Actually... I have two
graduations tomorrow.

02:50.453 --> 02:52.946
'Cause my other son Randall's
at a different school,

02:52.971 --> 02:55.976
and... he's valedictorian.

02:56.164 --> 02:58.319
Wow. Congratulations.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.546
Thank you.

03:00.661 --> 03:03.195
Let's see. Well, um...

03:03.898 --> 03:06.124
I mean, I have this one
right here, and I love it.

03:06.149 --> 03:08.163
Yeah, it has a-a flip-out monitor there

03:08.188 --> 03:09.898
and a really good digital zoom.

03:10.554 --> 03:13.023
I don't know what that means.

03:13.570 --> 03:17.242
Sorry, my husband, he used to...
handle all this stuff.

03:17.945 --> 03:19.265
Yeah.

03:19.977 --> 03:22.678
You know, I-I've been meaning
to reach out to you

03:22.680 --> 03:24.556
- ever since he...
- That's all right. Thanks.

03:25.654 --> 03:27.828
Uh... Okay.

03:28.195 --> 03:29.968
- Yeah, that looks good.
- All right.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.569
Um... well, it was very nice to see you.

03:33.594 --> 03:36.227
And I appreciate this recommendation.

03:36.392 --> 03:37.672
Thanks.

03:39.558 --> 03:40.843
Hey. Rebecca?

03:42.523 --> 03:44.452
Would you like to... I don't know...

03:44.711 --> 03:47.305
grab a cup of coffee
or something sometime?

03:49.859 --> 03:52.094
Or... you know, I-I shouldn't have...

03:53.000 --> 03:55.467
Uh, I-I'm... I'm gonna go pay.

03:56.109 --> 03:57.328
Yeah, okay.

So, Tess's stuff is in turquoise marker,

04:21.079 --> 04:24.781
Deja's is in dark purple marker,
Annie's is in light purple...

04:25.281 --> 04:27.752
which, now that I look at it,
looks a whole hell of a lot

04:27.777 --> 04:30.713
like that dark purple.
Dadgum it. Hey, baby.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.806
Damn, woman. How am I supposed
to keep my head on straight

04:35.831 --> 04:37.533
with you all up on this
kitchen island like that?

04:39.465 --> 04:40.697
Uh-uh.

04:42.564 --> 04:43.954
Oh, my.

04:45.001 --> 04:46.382
Oh, goodness.

04:48.873 --> 04:50.228
Mmm.

04:50.954 --> 04:52.587
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-mm.

04:53.813 --> 04:55.291
You messing with my schedule?

04:56.348 --> 04:58.021
I'm adding my dance classes

04:58.023 --> 05:01.291
because I am now a dance teacher.

05:01.492 --> 05:02.780
Happy first day, baby.

05:02.805 --> 05:04.202
I have beginner's ballet

05:04.227 --> 05:07.014
every Monday and Wednesday
morning, and then...

05:07.039 --> 05:09.585
- Yeah.
- ...modern three evenings a week.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.139
- Want to use the red marker?
- And...

05:11.474 --> 05:12.725
Wow.

05:13.727 --> 05:15.209
How are we gonna do this, Randall?

05:15.344 --> 05:17.177
Our schedule is already crazy.

05:17.475 --> 05:19.653
What happens when you get
sworn in next month?

05:20.133 --> 05:22.045
You'll be in a car three hours a day,

05:22.085 --> 05:24.920
and I'm teaching all these nights.

05:24.922 --> 05:26.221
I won't be home until 9:00.

05:26.223 --> 05:28.403
Look, we will hire someone to help out

05:28.428 --> 05:30.890
with the girls a few days
a week, pick 'em up from school.

05:31.008 --> 05:33.189
I know you were expecting me
to get a higher-paying job.

05:33.214 --> 05:34.580
No, uh, hey.

05:34.987 --> 05:36.453
Forget about that.

05:36.618 --> 05:39.454
We will figure out a way
to make this work. We're us.

05:39.789 --> 05:41.006
- Beth.
- Hmm?

05:41.031 --> 05:42.381
I need you to do me a favor.

05:42.406 --> 05:44.139
- What?
- Will you knock 'em dead?

05:45.393 --> 05:46.796
- Thanks, boo.
- Yeah.

05:47.444 --> 05:49.044
- Love you.
- Love you.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.155
Hey, Deja.

05:57.310 --> 05:59.115
Hey... Deja, you all right?

06:00.844 --> 06:02.030
What?

06:13.750 --> 06:15.288
What are you doing?

06:16.023 --> 06:17.358
It's graduation day.

06:17.383 --> 06:20.167
I'm the master of ceremonies,
Emcee Cum Laude.

06:20.311 --> 06:21.677
You are loud-ay.

06:21.679 --> 06:23.128
Come on, kid. Get out of bed.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.268
You waited 16 years to graduate college.

06:25.293 --> 06:26.386
It's time to celebrate.

06:26.411 --> 06:28.386
I completed eight credits
at a community college.

06:28.411 --> 06:29.577
It's really no big whoop.

06:29.602 --> 06:31.085
Uh, it's a big whoop.

06:31.110 --> 06:33.561
It's a huge whoop. Enormous.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.936
Something we should celebrate
by eating whoopie pies

06:35.961 --> 06:38.232
or having a Whoopi Goldberg
marathon or...

06:38.257 --> 06:39.709
- Okay. It's just... it's...
- Okay.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.248
We don't need to do this whole thing.

06:41.273 --> 06:43.085
- I want to do a whole thing.
- No.

06:43.258 --> 06:45.139
It's me. It's gonna be a whole thing.

06:45.193 --> 06:47.358
Babe... come on, let me celebrate you.

06:47.383 --> 06:48.897
- No.
- Please, let me celebrate you.

06:48.922 --> 06:50.693
- Thank you, thank you.
- Oh, please, oh, please.

06:50.718 --> 06:51.928
- No.
- No, but if you're gonna go out there,

06:51.953 --> 06:53.084
you should probably put a robe on.

06:53.109 --> 06:55.476
- Why?
- Well...

06:55.779 --> 06:57.104
Wait... what?

06:58.688 --> 07:00.962
- Ah!
- Mom?

07:00.995 --> 07:02.194
Hi, Bug.

07:02.710 --> 07:05.150
Aw, congratulations.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.173
We are throwing you
a graduation ceremony

07:08.198 --> 07:11.101
over on campus. So... whoop.

07:11.563 --> 07:14.075
Wait. You flew across
the country for this?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.833
- Mm-hmm.
- It's very sweet.

07:15.858 --> 07:18.866
It's wildly over the top
but... so sweet.

07:18.891 --> 07:21.116
I'm just sorry that Miguel
couldn't make it.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.147
But you know who is coming?

07:22.172 --> 07:24.795
He looks like Chris Hemsworth had a baby

07:24.820 --> 07:26.163
with the other Hemsworth.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.811
Oh.

07:51.602 --> 07:53.573
- Hey.
- Guess where I am.

07:53.644 --> 07:57.079
Uh, you are in New York at HBO,

07:57.081 --> 07:58.503
talking to them about your documentary.

07:58.528 --> 08:00.719
No. They rescheduled,

08:00.744 --> 08:02.556
so I came to L.A. for Kate's thing.

08:03.164 --> 08:05.136
I am on my way to your hotel.

08:05.317 --> 08:06.393
Surprise!

08:06.586 --> 08:08.500
So, how have all your meetings
been going?

08:08.525 --> 08:10.640
Steven Soderbergh
was this morning, right?

08:10.719 --> 08:13.053
Yeah. No, he's-he's ni... he's great.

08:13.055 --> 08:15.205
He's a nice guy. You know,
he's awfully chatty, though.

08:15.207 --> 08:17.615
You know, he... I literally
just got back not...

08:17.640 --> 08:19.718
not too long ago. How close are you?

08:19.979 --> 08:22.088
Close. Like ten or 15?

08:22.375 --> 08:24.320
- What room are you?
- Uh, you know, here's the thing.

08:24.345 --> 08:26.163
I was actually just
on my way out the door,

08:26.188 --> 08:27.546
to be honest with you.
I'm supposed to go meet

08:27.571 --> 08:28.937
Toby and Kate to help them, uh...

08:29.390 --> 08:31.195
set up for their party.
I'm running late, so

08:31.220 --> 08:32.707
maybe you should just
meet me at the party.

08:33.273 --> 08:34.344
Are you sure?

08:34.369 --> 08:36.461
Yeah, just-just meet me there.
I'll text you the address

08:36.485 --> 08:37.875
on my way over there, and, um...

08:37.900 --> 08:40.318
and I can't wait to see you.
I'm looking forward to it.

08:40.342 --> 08:42.351
- I miss you. Love you.
- Kevin, I love you.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.881
- Did you touch my box?
- What?

08:53.906 --> 08:57.031
- How does this thing even go?
- My box. Did you open it?

08:57.366 --> 08:59.929
I... I didn't even know you had a box.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.804
Randall, isn't your graduation tomorrow?

09:03.485 --> 09:05.672
- Gonna sleep in that thing?
- Lay off him.

09:05.750 --> 09:10.053
Wow. That's, um...
that's three whole words, Kate.

09:10.078 --> 09:11.515
More than you've said to me in weeks.

09:12.951 --> 09:14.992
Got you your cap and gown.

09:19.682 --> 09:21.231
Kate, this is stupid.

09:23.141 --> 09:24.765
I get that you're pissed
at me, but, like,

09:24.790 --> 09:26.242
you're gonna have
to talk to me eventually.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.586
Fine. You want to talk about it?

09:31.163 --> 09:33.497
Dad died four months ago.

09:33.842 --> 09:36.375
And now you're going to
abandon us to follow Sophie

09:36.400 --> 09:38.700
to New York to become an actor?

09:39.514 --> 09:41.101
What do you have against actors?

09:41.576 --> 09:42.703
I don't need this.

09:42.728 --> 09:44.140
I'm not going to graduation.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.742
Hello!

09:46.169 --> 09:47.695
Bought a video camera.

09:50.501 --> 09:51.672
What's wrong?

09:51.697 --> 09:53.625
Kate says she's not going
to our graduation.

09:53.714 --> 09:56.672
What? Kate, sweetheart, come on.

09:56.984 --> 09:59.718
That's crazy. You've worked
so hard to get here.

09:59.743 --> 10:01.743
And I don't want you
to regret not going...

10:01.768 --> 10:04.351
I'm not gonna walk across
some stage for...

10:04.376 --> 10:06.507
for a thousand people
to look at me, like,

10:06.644 --> 10:09.914
"Oh, there's that poor girl
whose dad died."

10:09.992 --> 10:13.937
And, "Oh, did you hear that
she has no plan whatsoever

10:13.962 --> 10:16.359
"while everyone else
is going off to college

10:16.384 --> 10:17.968
and starting their lives?"

10:35.691 --> 10:38.039
I invented a drink. It's called the...

10:38.513 --> 10:40.898
Commence-Mint Cocktail.

10:40.923 --> 10:42.039
Oh.

10:42.064 --> 10:44.007
Soda water, agave, rum,

10:44.032 --> 10:45.531
lime and fresh mint.

10:46.156 --> 10:47.484
So, a mojito?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.734
Just make it.

10:49.907 --> 10:52.374
Hey, babe, who are these chairs for?

10:52.484 --> 10:54.609
Uh, your family, your friends

10:54.634 --> 10:57.007
and the other graduating
students of the winter term.

10:57.702 --> 10:59.734
- What other students?
- I invited the other three students

10:59.759 --> 11:01.109
who are graduating this semester.

11:01.179 --> 11:02.922
There's Peter, who's a chem major.

11:02.947 --> 11:04.414
Claudia's pre-premed.

11:04.439 --> 11:08.304
And Eduardo moved here in 1952
to escape economic persecution.

11:08.395 --> 11:09.898
But now that his kids are grown,

11:09.923 --> 11:12.468
he has decided to reclaim the education

11:12.493 --> 11:14.539
that was ripped from him in his youth.

11:14.672 --> 11:15.906
Wait, how old is he?

11:15.931 --> 11:17.992
Extremely. Extremely old.

11:19.570 --> 11:21.520
How's my beautiful graduate?

11:21.545 --> 11:22.750
Mom, come on.

11:23.761 --> 11:25.920
I don't know. This is very thoughtful.
It really is.

11:25.945 --> 11:27.554
- And I'm so glad that you're here.
- Mm-hmm.

11:27.579 --> 11:29.445
But I shouldn't be celebrating
graduating college

11:29.470 --> 11:31.336
- 16 years late.
- Heyo!

11:31.703 --> 11:33.195
- There she is.
- Aha!

11:33.220 --> 11:34.829
- My God, you actually look smarter.
- Hey!

11:34.854 --> 11:36.117
- I'm glad you showed up.
- Aw.

11:36.142 --> 11:37.823
But I do want to know
why I haven't seen you all week.

11:37.825 --> 11:39.909
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Are you?

11:39.911 --> 11:41.086
Sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. I had, um...

11:41.111 --> 11:42.187
I've had all these meetings, you know?

11:42.212 --> 11:43.545
I just kept running back and forth.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.653
I-I... I'm here now, right?

11:45.827 --> 11:47.125
- You are.
- I'm here now. Yeah.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.507
I'm gonna go say hi to Toby.

11:48.532 --> 11:49.632
You look great.

11:49.956 --> 11:51.257
- Toby.
- Yeah.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.128
- Agave, not sugar.
- All right.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.640
What the...?

12:06.406 --> 12:07.679
Deja.

12:07.744 --> 12:09.062
Deja, what are you doing?

12:09.939 --> 12:11.021
Hey.

12:11.156 --> 12:12.617
Hey. Stop.

12:14.479 --> 12:16.640
I was on my way to get you.
What are you doing?

12:16.929 --> 12:18.257
If I didn't get out of that school,

12:18.282 --> 12:19.843
I was gonna punch a hole through a wall.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.781
So I decided to take a walk.

12:21.806 --> 12:24.090
All right. I appreciate your restraint.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.992
Now, will you tell me what's going on?

12:28.906 --> 12:30.664
So, in English class last week,

12:30.689 --> 12:32.781
we had to write these personal essays.

12:32.806 --> 12:34.305
"Personal" as in "private."

12:34.773 --> 12:36.579
Okay, did you get
a bad grade or something?

12:36.581 --> 12:38.265
No, no, I got a "A," but...

12:39.133 --> 12:41.467
today, I get to school,

12:41.469 --> 12:43.195
and everyone's looking at me.

12:44.203 --> 12:45.922
And all weird, like-like...

12:46.129 --> 12:47.796
like they know something about me.

12:48.203 --> 12:49.758
And it turns out they do.

12:49.875 --> 12:53.015
'Cause Ms. Cunningham published my essay

12:53.165 --> 12:55.148
in the school's online paper.

12:56.586 --> 12:58.968
And now all the kids
are calling me Pontiac.

12:58.993 --> 13:00.158
Pontiac?

13:04.316 --> 13:06.234
The essay was about the time

13:08.080 --> 13:09.725
we lived in my mom's car.

13:13.451 --> 13:15.273
And your teacher,
she didn't ask you first?

13:17.950 --> 13:19.140
No.

13:20.078 --> 13:22.789
No, she just went and did it
behind my back.

13:23.853 --> 13:25.132
Okay.

13:28.565 --> 13:30.109
Okay...

13:31.369 --> 13:32.672
Nope.

13:33.028 --> 13:34.797
No. Because...

13:35.148 --> 13:36.480
Okay.

13:37.224 --> 13:38.891
No, I...

13:38.916 --> 13:40.632
Will you go get in the car, please?

13:40.711 --> 13:42.351
I'm gonna straighten this out.

14:03.028 --> 14:05.208
Hey. Ready for the graduation
double feature?

14:05.233 --> 14:06.271
Wow.

14:06.296 --> 14:07.825
First stop, Hanes Academy.

14:07.982 --> 14:10.450
- Then on to McKinley High.
- One would think

14:10.452 --> 14:12.118
they would have these things
on separate days.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.771
Well, most families have kids
that go to the same school, Mom.

14:15.373 --> 14:17.161
Well, most families don't have a kid

14:17.186 --> 14:18.802
who's an absolute genius.

14:28.303 --> 14:29.739
I'm looking for Ms. Cunningham.

14:29.764 --> 14:32.153
Oh, well, you found her.
I'm her. That's, uh...

14:32.178 --> 14:33.794
I'm Ms. Cunningham. It's me.

14:34.427 --> 14:36.974
Right. Uh, I'm Randall Pearson.

14:37.028 --> 14:38.208
I'm Deja's dad.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.130
Oh. Yes, wow. Deja is just...

14:42.155 --> 14:45.185
Mortified.
She's mortified, Ms. Cunningham.

14:45.888 --> 14:48.396
You posted her personal essay
on the Internet.

14:49.036 --> 14:50.263
Her very sensitive,

14:50.288 --> 14:53.887
very exposing,
very private personal essay

14:53.912 --> 14:56.629
that you made very public
without her consent.

14:56.794 --> 14:59.371
She trusted you.
She trusted you, and you

14:59.396 --> 15:01.384
- completely violated that trust.
- Uh...

15:01.386 --> 15:02.817
- I...
- No, I'm not done yet.

15:05.341 --> 15:07.271
Do you know my daughter
just ran away from school

15:07.296 --> 15:08.966
because kids were calling her Pontiac?

15:09.982 --> 15:11.148
I...

15:11.603 --> 15:14.044
I am so sorry. I just, um...

15:14.747 --> 15:16.271
I thought... I mean, I wasn't...

15:16.296 --> 15:18.184
I didn't think. I wasn't thinking,

15:18.186 --> 15:21.654
and, um... I will take
the post down right now.

15:22.044 --> 15:23.185
Um...

15:31.256 --> 15:32.419
Uh...

15:33.190 --> 15:34.497
the post is down.

15:36.015 --> 15:37.177
Sorry if I made you cry.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.474
Oh. It's okay. It's, um...

15:39.541 --> 15:41.207
It's really not very hard.

15:41.888 --> 15:43.292
I was just, uh,

15:43.294 --> 15:45.442
really proud of her, you know?

15:45.467 --> 15:46.864
Of how far she's come.

15:47.966 --> 15:49.622
But I never should've published it.

15:49.647 --> 15:52.013
It was... stupid.

15:52.263 --> 15:53.716
Um, look,

15:53.741 --> 15:56.185
I know this is probably not
the best time to discuss this,

15:56.210 --> 15:58.332
but you chose to hold Deja back

15:58.357 --> 16:00.200
and have her repeat seventh grade again?

16:00.225 --> 16:02.083
Per her caseworker's recommendations.

16:02.447 --> 16:04.230
'Cause of all the moving around
she's done.

16:04.232 --> 16:05.653
Well, she's caught up.

16:06.554 --> 16:07.950
Very quickly.

16:08.653 --> 16:10.247
Frankly, I think she's ready to skip

16:10.272 --> 16:11.888
right into ninth grade next year.

16:13.727 --> 16:16.724
So she'd just, what,
skip the eighth grade?

16:16.749 --> 16:20.163
And I've spoken to her other
teachers, and they agree.

16:22.430 --> 16:23.614
Wow.

16:25.122 --> 16:28.403
All right, these are one size fits all.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.841
Here we go. There you are.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.192
- Tamaño único. Yeah, huh?
- Oh, gracias.

16:33.591 --> 16:35.310
I didn't know Toby was bilingual.

16:35.451 --> 16:36.685
That's sexy.

16:38.049 --> 16:41.075
Hey, Kev? Are you good?

16:42.989 --> 16:44.336
Are you okay?

16:44.661 --> 16:46.823
I mean, after everything
with Nicky, we haven't even

16:46.825 --> 16:49.208
- had a chance to talk about it.
- Cocktails for everyone.

16:49.294 --> 16:51.944
- Oh, yes.
- Mocktails for you two.

16:51.946 --> 16:53.732
- Thank you.
- Pregs, sobes.

16:53.757 --> 16:54.903
Thank you.

16:56.521 --> 16:58.192
You haven't talked to him at all?

16:58.503 --> 17:00.232
I know the whole thing was hard for you.

17:01.724 --> 17:02.896
- Kev...
- Kate...

17:02.921 --> 17:04.786
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

17:04.810 --> 17:07.396
I think I put in your address
in Santa Monica instead of L.A.

17:07.421 --> 17:09.939
Two-hour detour. I hate this city.

17:09.964 --> 17:11.297
There she is.

17:11.604 --> 17:12.762
Mwah. Mwah.

17:13.458 --> 17:14.771
So how has your week been together?

17:14.796 --> 17:16.185
I heard you had a spa day.

17:17.521 --> 17:18.739
- Uh, we were going to...
- Uh, we didn't.

17:18.763 --> 17:21.523
I was gonna, um... I scheduled
some facials, and we were gonna

17:21.526 --> 17:23.482
do a whole thing, and then the
meetings happened and kind of

17:23.507 --> 17:25.575
messed with everything,
and I've been running her out.

17:25.715 --> 17:28.231
Let me ask you a question.
Is it too early to do a toast?

17:28.233 --> 17:29.341
- Please don't.
- You know what? Screw it.

17:29.366 --> 17:30.782
I invented the early toast.
We're doing a toast.

17:30.807 --> 17:33.091
Excuse me, everyone.
Early toast, everybody.

17:33.116 --> 17:35.333
Clink, clink, clink. Can I have
your attention, please?

17:36.261 --> 17:38.762
I want to make a toast
to my sister Kate.

17:39.169 --> 17:41.917
Kate is 28 weeks pregnant,
and she wanted to graduate

17:41.942 --> 17:43.496
before she gave birth to her son.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.005
So, for the past few months,
she's been working really hard.

17:46.278 --> 17:49.302
All while creating life inside her body,

17:49.304 --> 17:52.560
which, if you ask me, that is
some ultimate multitasking.

17:52.585 --> 17:53.810
Right?

17:53.835 --> 17:56.833
My sister is smart, she's determined...

18:06.080 --> 18:07.363
And, um...

18:08.302 --> 18:11.005
anyway, listen, anyway, I love you.

18:11.104 --> 18:12.687
Um...

18:13.111 --> 18:14.310
I'm proud of you. Congratulation...

18:14.335 --> 18:15.825
To Kate, everybody.

18:17.782 --> 18:19.505
To Kate.

18:24.943 --> 18:26.120
Oh, wow.

18:26.264 --> 18:27.597
Oh, um...

18:28.245 --> 18:29.862
- Don't kill me.
- What?

18:29.887 --> 18:31.854
It's just, my, um...

18:31.879 --> 18:33.379
my agent texted me, and he said

18:33.381 --> 18:35.214
that Soderbergh's producers
want to meet with me,

18:35.216 --> 18:37.510
- like, right now. So, I-I got to...
- Oh, my God. Yeah.

18:37.535 --> 18:39.135
- It's amazing.
- It could be, right?

18:39.137 --> 18:42.361
- So, I got to take that.
- Yeah. I know, I... You should go.

18:42.386 --> 18:43.517
- But-but congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:43.542 --> 18:44.772
And, by the way,
I'm gonna come right back

18:44.797 --> 18:45.853
after this is done.

18:45.878 --> 18:47.290
And, uh... Mwah.

18:47.315 --> 18:49.001
I will see you in a bit. Okay? Promise.

18:49.853 --> 18:50.885
Break a leg.

18:51.104 --> 18:52.721
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- Okay.

18:59.010 --> 19:01.337
I still can't believe
you made Ms. Cunningham cry.

19:01.425 --> 19:04.209
I didn't mean to. Or maybe I did.

19:04.779 --> 19:07.897
Hey, no one messes with my girl, right?

19:11.417 --> 19:12.714
Um...

19:13.277 --> 19:15.077
Ms. Cunningham says that you're...

19:15.555 --> 19:18.199
you're doing better than every
other student in your class.

19:19.096 --> 19:21.884
Deja... she posted your essay

19:21.909 --> 19:25.770
because she was impressed,
because your work is advanced.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.034
So advanced that she thinks

19:29.059 --> 19:31.348
that you should skip right
to high school next year.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.372
- Wh-What?
- Yeah.

19:34.878 --> 19:36.751
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not doing that.

19:36.753 --> 19:38.386
Look, I know it's a lot,

19:38.388 --> 19:41.058
but the fact that you've
caught up to everybody already,

19:41.542 --> 19:42.915
Deja, that's a really big deal.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.938
You know what's a big deal?
Bumping up a black girl

19:44.940 --> 19:47.628
- who used to be homeless.
- That's not what she's doing.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.563
She said that she talked
to all of your other teachers...

19:50.588 --> 19:52.057
All the other white teachers?

19:54.057 --> 19:55.287
Mm-hmm.

20:00.510 --> 20:02.064
Deja, I read your essay.

20:03.573 --> 20:04.899
It's spectacular.

20:04.924 --> 20:07.509
Look, a lot of kids have good essays.

20:07.534 --> 20:09.106
I'm only getting special treatment

20:09.108 --> 20:10.841
because I used to live in a car.

20:12.073 --> 20:14.278
And I don't want it. I'm not like you.

20:15.901 --> 20:17.346
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

20:17.371 --> 20:18.683
No, no. No, no, no.

20:18.820 --> 20:20.669
Come on. You can say it.

20:23.581 --> 20:24.933
You know, it's just...

20:25.901 --> 20:28.831
every article that's come out
about you...

20:30.284 --> 20:33.911
talks about how you were
dropped off at a fire station.

20:34.542 --> 20:35.817
Okay.

20:36.042 --> 20:38.729
And then it goes on to say
how I beat the odds and won

20:38.731 --> 20:40.297
- a very important election.
- Mm-hmm.

20:40.299 --> 20:41.756
They're writing about my journey.

20:41.842 --> 20:44.075
- You know, I'm a councilman.
- You're a story.

20:46.023 --> 20:49.572
And no offense, Randall, but
I don't want to do it that way.

20:55.846 --> 20:59.185
Welcome, friends, family.

21:00.159 --> 21:04.229
On behalf of the fine students
at Encino Community College,

21:04.510 --> 21:06.189
I present to you...

21:06.260 --> 21:09.970
the graduating class of 2019.

21:16.159 --> 21:19.323
Kate Emily Pearson.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.480
Congratulations.

21:40.307 --> 21:41.440
Hey, Bug.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.429
- Hey.
- Could we, um...

21:43.697 --> 21:44.940
Could we get a selfie?

21:45.736 --> 21:47.596
- Yes, we can get a selfie.
- Yeah? Okay.

21:47.799 --> 21:50.190
Can you take it?
'Cause I always mess it up.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.626
Hopefully, I won't. Here we go.

21:51.659 --> 21:52.991
- You got it.
- All right.

21:53.815 --> 21:54.940
Cheese.

21:56.268 --> 21:57.388
Ah, I love it.

21:57.413 --> 21:58.713
- Let me see.
- Okay.

22:02.714 --> 22:05.476
- Oh, God. Mom, are you crying?
- No, I'm not.

22:05.478 --> 22:06.761
I'm just...

22:07.706 --> 22:10.173
I always wanted a picture of you
in your cap and gown.

22:10.198 --> 22:11.652
Okay. Well, I will text it to you.

22:11.677 --> 22:14.323
Kate, I am your mom. Let me have
a moment, okay?

22:20.081 --> 22:22.027
You know, after your father died,

22:22.763 --> 22:24.135
what I hated the most?

22:25.788 --> 22:26.886
Time.

22:37.392 --> 22:40.244
I was so angry at it.

22:41.643 --> 22:42.914
I just...

22:42.939 --> 22:46.235
despised clocks and calendars.

22:46.260 --> 22:48.092
And anything that was
telling me that life

22:48.117 --> 22:50.588
was moving on and I needed
to move along with it.

22:53.776 --> 22:55.031
Rebecca?

22:55.455 --> 22:56.850
Rebecca, hey, where are you going?

22:58.009 --> 23:01.267
And I think you and I are really
alike in that way, you know?

23:01.690 --> 23:03.681
We really didn't want

23:03.706 --> 23:06.089
the next big moments
of our life to come.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.595
I can't do it.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.431
I can't go in there.
I can't be in there right now.

23:10.456 --> 23:11.655
- I can't. Just...
- What's going on?

23:12.057 --> 23:14.057
This is all wrong.
He was supposed to be here.

23:14.414 --> 23:15.714
I can't breathe.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.604
Not without him.

23:19.206 --> 23:20.628
Not for a very long time.

23:21.725 --> 23:23.409
Just try to breathe.

23:32.623 --> 23:34.064
Rebecca, um...

23:36.619 --> 23:37.729
maybe it's...

23:37.975 --> 23:39.339
maybe it's, uh...

23:41.065 --> 23:42.749
I-I think it might be good for you

23:42.751 --> 23:45.776
to-to talk to someone about this.

23:46.463 --> 23:50.049
They have groups for this kind of thing.

23:50.448 --> 23:52.370
- Gr-Grief counseling.
- I don't want...

23:52.885 --> 23:54.705
I don't want grief counseling, Miguel.

23:54.730 --> 23:56.357
I want to rewind the clock.

23:57.534 --> 23:59.369
I just want to rewind the clock.

23:59.394 --> 24:00.526
- Rebecca.
- I...

24:00.551 --> 24:01.897
Listen to me, Rebecca.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.854
Randall is about to graduate.

24:04.327 --> 24:05.541
Okay.

24:09.885 --> 24:10.901
Here.

24:10.926 --> 24:12.002
I'll...

24:13.205 --> 24:14.791
I'll hold the camera, okay?

24:15.384 --> 24:16.821
And all you have to do

24:17.096 --> 24:18.760
is just be there for your son.

24:19.890 --> 24:21.025
- Okay.
- Okay?

24:25.399 --> 24:26.557
You and me,

24:26.613 --> 24:28.486
we needed to go at our own pace.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.486
But these past few years,

24:33.180 --> 24:35.611
you have absolutely blown me away, Kate.

24:36.979 --> 24:39.049
You've just... you've-you've seized

24:39.082 --> 24:40.682
the big moments of your life,

24:41.982 --> 24:43.729
and now you're having a baby.

24:44.486 --> 24:45.952
I'm having a baby.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.002
And not because time told you to,

24:49.234 --> 24:51.401
but because
you were really ready for it.

24:51.426 --> 24:52.666
You know?

24:53.276 --> 24:55.034
And I-I know you think this whole

24:55.059 --> 24:58.316
graduation party's really silly
'cause it's 16 years too late,

24:58.341 --> 25:01.322
but I got to tell you, I think
it's right on friggin' time.

25:01.772 --> 25:03.022
Okay?

25:06.096 --> 25:08.921
Wait, did Rebecca Pearson
just drop the "F" bomb?

25:08.946 --> 25:10.140
I did.

25:11.542 --> 25:12.898
It was called for.

25:15.904 --> 25:17.406
Is everything okay, Bug?

25:18.596 --> 25:19.729
What?

25:23.909 --> 25:25.792
That really was a great speech, Randall.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.213
Thanks for dropping me off, Mom.

25:31.619 --> 25:33.440
Kate, are you sure about this?

25:33.830 --> 25:35.056
Yeah.

25:36.455 --> 25:38.588
Just-just come to our graduation.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.664
You're gonna have to get your diploma.

25:41.097 --> 25:42.338
They can mail it.

25:43.273 --> 25:45.976
Uh, the-the Kornhabers
are having a party after, Kate.

25:46.322 --> 25:48.924
Oh, good. You can tell them all
about your big move to New York.

26:36.003 --> 26:37.800
Oh, Kev, that's so sweet,

26:37.802 --> 26:39.235
but she has her own food.

26:39.237 --> 26:40.941
You don't have to share yours.

26:52.071 --> 26:53.346
Kevin?

26:53.587 --> 26:55.533
Come on, it's me. Open up.

26:56.771 --> 26:58.017
Kevin.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.154
Kevin, I know that you're in there.

27:01.156 --> 27:02.526
Will you open the door?

27:03.331 --> 27:05.097
Hey. What are you doing here?

27:05.122 --> 27:06.612
I was just gonna come back
to your party.

27:07.943 --> 27:09.033
Kate.

27:28.549 --> 27:30.165
I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you.

27:30.313 --> 27:31.762
All right? I wouldn't do that.

27:31.905 --> 27:34.321
The Nicky thing,
it messed me up a little bit.

27:34.346 --> 27:37.431
Okay, and it triggered my... whatever.

27:38.496 --> 27:39.962
And I had a drink.

27:41.038 --> 27:42.344
Maybe...

27:44.490 --> 27:46.017
maybe that got out of hand.

27:47.304 --> 27:48.517
Okay.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.398
Here's what we're gonna do.

27:50.831 --> 27:53.304
You, first, have to tell Zoe.

27:53.329 --> 27:55.038
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.

27:55.063 --> 27:56.179
Listen to me. You don't understand.

27:56.204 --> 27:57.367
I am begging you, okay?

27:57.392 --> 28:00.023
I'm begging you, trust me,
she's got stuff, all right,

28:00.048 --> 28:02.596
and if she finds out
I was lying to her, Kate...

28:04.851 --> 28:06.967
if she finds out I was lying
to her, she's gonna leave.

28:07.549 --> 28:08.972
- You don't know that.
- What do you want me to do?

28:08.997 --> 28:10.448
What do you want me to do?
What? I'm... What, you want me

28:10.473 --> 28:12.979
to go to the meetings? I'll go
to the meetings, all right?

28:13.004 --> 28:14.437
I'll go to the meetings.
Just give me a week.

28:14.462 --> 28:15.737
Just-just let me get a week of meetings

28:15.762 --> 28:17.589
under my belt before you
say anything, please.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.050
Then I'll tell her, okay?

28:20.783 --> 28:21.893
Kate?

28:23.209 --> 28:24.214
Okay.

28:25.042 --> 28:26.644
But, Kev, you have to get
a sponsor this time.

28:26.669 --> 28:28.597
- I'll get a sponsor.
- You didn't get one before.

28:28.622 --> 28:30.409
I'll get a sponsor this time.
I'll do the whole thing right.

28:30.434 --> 28:31.925
Okay? I promise. Hey.

28:32.365 --> 28:33.612
And you know what?

28:34.300 --> 28:35.480
What are you doing?

28:35.982 --> 28:37.401
I'm looking for a meeting.

28:44.384 --> 28:46.846
Oh, look, there's a 5:30 in Hollywood.

28:47.983 --> 28:49.103
Great.

28:49.759 --> 28:51.018
Come on, I'll take you.

28:52.711 --> 28:53.909
Come on.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.182
- Kev.
- Kate, I...

28:57.913 --> 29:00.971
You can. You can.

29:12.965 --> 29:14.853
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.811
Hey, little mamas, dinner in five.

29:22.503 --> 29:23.757
Are you done already?

29:24.176 --> 29:26.585
You just breezed through
your geometry, like that?

29:26.937 --> 29:28.514
Oh, do I have to start pretending things

29:28.539 --> 29:31.155
are harder for me now?
'Cause I can reopen this book.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.905
No, no, no, of course not.

29:37.699 --> 29:38.943
Hey, listen.

29:43.405 --> 29:46.630
What you said before, I get it.

29:47.418 --> 29:48.600
I do.

29:49.174 --> 29:50.807
There's always gonna be people out there

29:50.809 --> 29:53.853
who act like it's extra special
when you do something impressive

29:53.878 --> 29:55.554
because of where you came from.

29:56.604 --> 29:57.978
You can't control that.

29:59.212 --> 30:01.868
All you can control is what you do.

30:04.330 --> 30:06.485
Just think about it.

30:15.993 --> 30:18.720
That's not the only reason why
I don't want to skip a grade.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.274
Oh?

30:23.083 --> 30:25.776
I'm finally getting used to
things the way they are.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.520
And it's not just at school; it's...

30:29.849 --> 30:31.739
it's, like, the ride to school and...

30:32.870 --> 30:34.870
all of us going at the same time.

30:34.895 --> 30:37.104
You or Beth waiting out front

30:37.148 --> 30:38.878
at the end of the day to pick us up.

30:40.951 --> 30:43.627
Skipping to high school
is going to change things.

30:44.737 --> 30:46.507
And for the first time in my life,

30:46.532 --> 30:48.218
I don't want things to change.

30:57.205 --> 30:58.780
Crap, I got to call Toby.

31:00.246 --> 31:01.749
And I'll-I'll just tell him...

31:02.667 --> 31:03.859
Well...

31:04.899 --> 31:06.148
what should I tell him?

31:09.405 --> 31:12.350
You know, you could tell him you
have a meeting with Soderbergh.

31:12.965 --> 31:14.045
Kev.

31:19.353 --> 31:20.476
Oh...

31:22.893 --> 31:23.989
What?

31:24.384 --> 31:26.024
I don't know. Uh...

31:26.549 --> 31:28.749
Something's wrong. Something is...

31:29.950 --> 31:31.459
What is it?

31:32.380 --> 31:34.772
- I think my water just broke.
- What?

31:36.209 --> 31:37.732
Okay, uh...

31:38.604 --> 31:40.613
Let-let...
Uh, let's-let's-let's pull over.

31:40.615 --> 31:41.747
Pull-pull the car over, okay?

31:41.749 --> 31:43.471
- Okay. Okay.
- Just pull the car over.

31:47.922 --> 31:49.190
Okay.

31:52.253 --> 31:55.971
This can't be happening.
It's too soon. It's too soon.

31:56.221 --> 31:58.800
I'm only... I'm only 28 weeks.
It's too soon.

31:58.802 --> 32:01.635
We should go to the hospital.
Will you call Toby?

32:02.179 --> 32:03.751
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.300
Toby, it's me. Listen,
I'm in the car with Kate,

32:10.325 --> 32:11.991
and, uh, her water just broke.

32:12.110 --> 32:13.901
I really think we should
call an ambulance.

32:16.212 --> 32:17.761
Because I can't drive right now.

32:21.108 --> 32:22.588
Because I've been drinking all day.

32:23.612 --> 32:25.674
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm sorry, Toby. I...

32:28.112 --> 32:29.401
I'm gonna call an ambulance, okay?

32:29.426 --> 32:31.166
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

32:32.085 --> 32:33.213
Okay.

32:38.922 --> 32:40.182
- Kate?
- Toby!

32:41.818 --> 32:43.049
Kate, hey!

33:13.729 --> 33:14.830
Hey.

33:14.855 --> 33:16.089
Let me tell you,

33:16.678 --> 33:21.206
today was a day to end all first days.

33:21.317 --> 33:23.117
That's what's up.

33:23.971 --> 33:25.104
What happened?

33:29.003 --> 33:31.080
Deja wrote this essay,

33:31.082 --> 33:33.745
and her teacher shared it
without asking.

33:42.116 --> 33:44.486
She thinks that Deja could skip
right to high school next year.

33:45.745 --> 33:47.318
That sounds like good news.

33:47.343 --> 33:49.107
Deja doesn't want to skip a grade.

33:50.865 --> 33:52.529
Because she loves her routine.

33:53.872 --> 33:56.098
For the first time in her life,
she has stability.

33:57.741 --> 33:58.990
I, um...

34:00.276 --> 34:02.601
I started looking into hiring a sitter.

34:02.991 --> 34:05.752
Not some college kid,
but a... an experienced adult

34:05.754 --> 34:07.253
to be here when we're working.

34:07.608 --> 34:10.022
Someone who knows their way
around adopted kids

34:10.047 --> 34:12.577
and newly out daughters.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.857
And it's not cheap.

34:16.728 --> 34:17.897
I know.

34:19.889 --> 34:21.304
And money aside...

34:22.842 --> 34:25.318
do we really want some stranger
picking up the slack?

34:25.342 --> 34:27.295
Is that what's best for our girls?

34:29.154 --> 34:30.608
What are you trying to say?

34:37.696 --> 34:40.670
You sacrificed a lot
when I was campaigning.

34:41.940 --> 34:44.074
You were here with the girls
when I couldn't be.

34:44.418 --> 34:45.896
All while struggling to figure out

34:45.920 --> 34:47.958
what you wanted next for your life.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.053
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate that.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.560
How much I appreciate you.

34:55.130 --> 34:59.373
But your dance schedule,
the nights and weekends,

35:00.364 --> 35:01.614
that's when our girls are around.

35:01.639 --> 35:03.442
That's when they need us here the most.

35:06.608 --> 35:09.645
And I was just wondering
if maybe we should...

35:12.613 --> 35:15.863
...put a pin in your being
a dance teacher.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.802
But not forever, okay?
It's just for a little while.

35:19.184 --> 35:20.770
And we get a job with normal hours

35:20.795 --> 35:23.122
so you can be here with the kids.

35:30.781 --> 35:33.535
So, you get to have your dream,
and I'm just supposed to...

35:33.919 --> 35:35.149
quit mine?

35:37.599 --> 35:38.747
I...

35:39.333 --> 35:40.504
Hold on a second.

35:42.044 --> 35:43.326
Sorry.

35:44.266 --> 35:45.409
Hey, Mom.

35:46.137 --> 35:47.317
Kate what?

35:49.603 --> 35:50.928
That's too soon.

36:28.347 --> 36:29.685
Not even Mr. Addison.

36:29.727 --> 36:32.228
Especially not Mr. Addison.

36:34.052 --> 36:36.202
Well, I guess that's all my news.

36:36.204 --> 36:38.288
Babe.

36:38.290 --> 36:39.529
- Hmm?
- What are you doing?

36:39.554 --> 36:41.234
I'm in my PJs watching Moonlighting.

36:41.259 --> 36:43.259
What about this is remotely interesting?

36:43.261 --> 36:44.599
- Everything.
- No.

36:44.913 --> 36:46.112
Not true.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.154
- Hey.
- Oh...

36:47.179 --> 36:50.310
You know, you missed my mouth
by an inch.

36:50.335 --> 36:52.402
- Yeah. Well, give me that.
- An inch. What? No.

36:52.404 --> 36:55.138
Yeah, I'm gonna give you
a taste of your own medicine.

36:55.287 --> 36:57.044
- See how much you like it.
- I'm...

36:57.069 --> 36:59.109
- Whoa, there he is. Uh-huh.
- Come on.

36:59.111 --> 37:00.410
No, come on. Come on, look.

37:00.412 --> 37:01.865
You know that I-I'm a...

37:02.247 --> 37:03.480
I'm a behind-the-scenes guy.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.148
Yeah? Well, put on a show. Ready?

37:05.150 --> 37:07.584
- Really? You want me to put on a show?
- Yeah.

37:07.936 --> 37:09.435
- Okay, hold on.
- You ready?

37:09.437 --> 37:11.754
- Wait, wait. Wait. Count of three.
- Okay.

37:11.756 --> 37:13.193
- Ready? One...
- One.

37:13.498 --> 37:14.797
- Two...
- Two.

37:17.145 --> 37:18.979
You didn't get to three.

37:22.349 --> 37:24.423
- You faked me.
- Did I get you?

37:46.341 --> 37:48.514
Miguel, hi. It's Rebecca.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.654
Um...

37:50.810 --> 37:54.285
so the kids are at a party tonight,

37:54.310 --> 37:57.293
and this apartment is horrible.

37:57.318 --> 38:01.451
I mean, I really can't
be here right now.

38:01.503 --> 38:02.740
I can't...

38:03.324 --> 38:05.024
I can't be anywhere right now.

38:05.510 --> 38:06.510
But...

38:07.912 --> 38:09.958
...maybe there is one of those, uh...

38:15.752 --> 38:16.998
...those, um...

38:19.740 --> 38:22.716
...grief support...

38:23.717 --> 38:26.317
group meetings you were talking about.

38:26.319 --> 38:28.701
Maybe there's one of those t-tonight.

38:30.050 --> 38:32.013
And maybe you could come pick me up?

38:44.408 --> 38:45.701
I'll be right here waiting for you.

38:49.058 --> 38:50.302
Okay.

38:51.833 --> 38:53.533
Here goes.

39:09.684 --> 39:10.879
You're here.

39:10.904 --> 39:12.082
You're a genius.

39:12.341 --> 39:13.496
Where's Sophie?

39:21.321 --> 39:22.303
It's warm.

39:22.328 --> 39:24.137
Yeah, sorry.
I've been out here for a while.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.754
I've been thinking about
the whole New York thing,

39:30.779 --> 39:32.520
and, um, you were right.

39:33.052 --> 39:35.881
It's a stupid idea,
so I can stay here with you...

39:35.906 --> 39:37.379
No. No way.

39:38.319 --> 39:39.504
You're going.

39:41.684 --> 39:44.285
It's not your job
to stay here and protect me.

39:44.654 --> 39:46.160
Okay, not anymore.

39:50.895 --> 39:53.589
Just... just promise me that

39:53.591 --> 39:56.113
if some weird guy asks you
to audition for a movie

39:56.138 --> 39:57.465
in his basement...

39:57.490 --> 39:58.890
...you run. Okay?

39:59.449 --> 40:00.463
Hey.

40:00.488 --> 40:02.996
- Better safe than sorry, pretty boy.
- Okay.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.470
Randall, get over here.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.199
Why are you lurking, creeper?

40:10.224 --> 40:13.285
I thought you two were about to
lean in for a kiss or something.

40:13.310 --> 40:14.504
Shut up, dude.

40:19.970 --> 40:22.871
Weird... that high school's over.

40:23.285 --> 40:26.059
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:29.467 --> 40:30.910
What do you think's gonna happen to us?

40:32.082 --> 40:33.317
What do you mean?

40:34.350 --> 40:35.956
Like, are we gonna hang out much?

40:36.529 --> 40:38.559
Like, you know, when we get older.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.136
Barbecue.

40:41.403 --> 40:44.442
Celebrate our kids' birthdays.
Spend the holidays together.

40:44.832 --> 40:45.853
- Of course.
- I don't know.

40:45.878 --> 40:46.895
Kevin.

40:47.255 --> 40:48.332
I mean, you two will

40:48.357 --> 40:50.301
obviously end up sharing
an apartment or something.

40:50.326 --> 40:51.684
What are you talking about?

40:52.041 --> 40:53.621
It's the Big Three, okay,

40:53.646 --> 40:55.223
- not the Big Two.
- No.

40:56.067 --> 40:58.879
You two got your own thing,
and I don't want any part

40:58.904 --> 41:00.237
of what's going on there.

41:00.262 --> 41:01.903
Yeah, 'cause Mom would
probably get jealous.

41:02.986 --> 41:04.379
Probably.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.887
Hey, well, I'm gonna head out.

41:14.912 --> 41:16.004
Okay.

41:25.723 --> 41:28.160
- Hey.
- Toby's talking with your doctor, okay?

41:29.965 --> 41:31.317
All right.

41:34.004 --> 41:35.691
Listen, it's okay.

41:35.716 --> 41:37.395
That shot that they gave you,
it's working.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.168
It's delayed your labor, what,
ten hours so far?

41:41.557 --> 41:43.660
I don't need hours, Kev. I need weeks.

41:54.331 --> 41:55.489
Hey.

41:55.985 --> 41:57.317
I know the answer.

41:58.135 --> 41:59.528
What's gonna happen to us?

42:01.019 --> 42:02.793
As long as we stay
in each other's lives...

42:04.704 --> 42:05.887
...we'll be okay.

42:11.535 --> 42:14.653
This... this baby can't die, you guys.

42:15.028 --> 42:16.338
- He won't.
- He won't.

42:17.565 --> 42:18.762
You promise?

42:20.949 --> 42:22.248
I promise.
