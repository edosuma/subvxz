00:40.498 --> 00:44.210
The other day I was watching
one of those travel shows on PBS,

00:44.294 --> 00:46.838
-it was all about Ireland.
- Ooh.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.631
- I would be interested.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.633
- It's so beautiful.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:50.717 --> 00:54.054
And anyway,<i> </i>they were showing
videos of people doing that Riverdance.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.347
- Oh, yeah. Yes.
- Do you remember that?

00:56.431 --> 00:57.932
It's so weird.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.435
It's like their bodies are so straight

01:00.518 --> 01:03.897
-and then their legs, like, go crazy.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.191
The upper half is straight
and the bottom half--

01:06.274 --> 01:08.318
Then the bottom is like...

01:09.736 --> 01:12.405
- You like that, huh, Sarah?
- Yeah.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.033
- They probably are so strong.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.745
I should like it
because I'm Irish, but I'm not a big fan.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.790
-Have you ever done DNANU?
-No.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.792
You know, it's that kit where you...

01:23.875 --> 01:27.921
spit in a tube and you send it away
and they can tell you your heritage.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.965
Don't you have to, like,
prick your own blood?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.133
No, you don't give blood.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.886
You send it away and they give you
the results back so fast.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.722
And, you know, I told you I'm Irish,
which I knew about.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.309
So I found out I'm 96% Irish,

01:42.268 --> 01:45.939
Welsh, and then I'm 3% Finland,

01:46.022 --> 01:48.358
Northwest Russia,

01:48.441 --> 01:52.153
and then 1% Senegal, Gambia.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.155
-Do you know where that is?
-Mmm-mmm.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.323
West Africa.

01:55.406 --> 01:58.243
-What?
-I'm from West Africa!

01:58.326 --> 02:00.537
-Can you believe it?
- That's crazy!

02:02.038 --> 02:04.499
-You should do it.
-Wow! I would try that.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.583
Yeah.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.044
I don't really know anything
about my family,

02:08.128 --> 02:10.421
but people have said that I look Irish.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.506
You look very Irish.

02:11.589 --> 02:12.757
-You think so?
-Yeah.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.552
Well, maybe we're Irish sisters.

02:15.635 --> 02:20.598
Maybe we're Irish... West African sisters.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.355
Yeah, I would try that for sure.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.905
So, these are the acrylic paints
that we're carrying right now,

02:35.989 --> 02:37.991
and these are all of our tempera paints.

02:38.074 --> 02:41.327
I would suggest, for a classroom setting,
always going with the tempera paint.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.662
The acrylic is beautiful,

02:42.745 --> 02:45.331
and honestly, they're both water-based,
they're both nontoxic.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.417
And, like, what's his name?

02:47.500 --> 02:49.169
-His name is Ryan.
-Ryan?

02:49.252 --> 02:50.336
-Yeah.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.384
The clean-up with acrylic--
I mean, it dries beautifully, it's--

02:56.467 --> 02:59.304
like, with a nice gloss to it,
but tempera's my favorite.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.722
He asked me out on a date.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.348
We-- We have this little joke

03:02.432 --> 03:04.976
where we, like, write everything
on Post-it Notes to each other,

03:05.059 --> 03:09.272
so he put a little note on my locker
asking me if I wanted to go out with him.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.110
The consistency now is really more, like,
kind of a pudding,

03:14.194 --> 03:18.448
but if you just add a little bit of water,
it would be like a heavy cream.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.742
Did you just,
like, find him and show him,

03:20.825 --> 03:23.661
-and tell him yeah? Or, like...
-I wrote it on a little note.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.955
-You wrote him back, put it on his locker?
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.721
Go ahead and just...
start her in a circle.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.307
Yeah. Keep going.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.184
Nice.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.978
Make a wider circle. Bring her out a bit.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.730
Yeah.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.733
Give you some more room
to move like that. Nice.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.737
<i>It was really good riding today.</i>

03:57.820 --> 03:59.322
- <i>Oh, thanks.</i>
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>

03:59.405 --> 04:02.116
<i>I just think you wanna</i>
<i>keep thinking about your form,</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:03.409
you know...

04:03.493 --> 04:06.287
-Oh.
-And, uh, your confidence.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.623
When you're confident, Willow's confident.

04:08.706 --> 04:12.168
She's a really intuitive girl.
She can feel your energy, you know...

04:12.252 --> 04:13.836
-Yeah.
-...so you wanna kind of

04:13.920 --> 04:15.505
really be in tune with her.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.215
I noticed you looking down a lot.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.717
Really wanna keep your eyes up
and look to where you're going.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.262
It's gonna be so important
when you get to jumps and--

04:22.345 --> 04:25.223
Oh, well, I'm riding Western,
so I'm not gonna be doing jumps.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.519
Well, Willow was trained English.
I used to ride her English.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.229
I'm just gonna stay Western with her.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.981
She really enjoys that style.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.482
-You might enjoy it, too.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.986
-I think, um, my mom's here.
-To have that versatility would be good.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.195
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
-Okay. Okay. Bye!
-Uh, bye!

05:17.859 --> 05:20.820
<i>Ecchymosis indicates a struggle.</i>

05:20.903 --> 05:21.863
<i>Poor girl.</i>

05:23.614 --> 05:24.449
<i>Are you serious?</i>

05:24.532 --> 05:26.242
<i>What? It gives me the heebie-jeebies.</i>

05:26.326 --> 05:27.452
<i>The heebie-jeebies?</i>

05:28.911 --> 05:31.247
<i>Darren, you literally</i>
<i>just vanquished the demon Scox</i>

05:31.331 --> 05:34.417
<i>in a dirty gas station bathroom,</i>
<i>and this is too much for you?</i>

05:34.500 --> 05:35.501
<i>That was different.</i>

05:35.585 --> 05:37.837
<i>Different how?</i>
<i>And who says "heebie-jeebies"?</i>

05:37.920 --> 05:40.631
<i>Fine. Sorry. Jeez. I forgot we're not</i>
<i>supposed to have feelings.</i>

05:43.509 --> 05:45.678
<i>Proceed. Go. Go ahead.</i>

05:47.513 --> 05:49.098
<i>-</i>

05:49.182 --> 05:50.725
- <i>Bingo.</i>

05:51.601 --> 05:53.186
<i>Mark of Hades.</i>

05:56.356 --> 05:58.149
-Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.778
What's this? <i>Purgatory?</i>

06:01.861 --> 06:04.030
Yeah. Just unwinding after work.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.366
I'm making an anklet.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.575
Nice.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.828
Hey, Brian's new roommate is single.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.248
Maybe we could all go out sometime?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.001
Maybe.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.046
All right. Have fun.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.047
You, too.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.180
<i>They drain the vic's life force.</i>

06:29.263 --> 06:30.848
<i>Come on, give me a hand.</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:35.144
<i>I knew it.</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:36.854
- <i>A scryer.</i>
<i>-Mmm-hmm.</i>

06:36.938 --> 06:38.314
<i>She must have been working for Dee.</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:41.526
<i>The question is, who's Dee working for?</i>

08:03.566 --> 08:05.776
Sarah?

08:07.695 --> 08:08.738
Sarah?

08:11.324 --> 08:12.200
Sorry.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.061
Happy birthday!

09:22.144 --> 09:23.312
Joan!

09:43.374 --> 09:45.084
-You didn't!
-I did!

09:45.167 --> 09:46.460
Oh!

09:51.882 --> 09:53.759
-Oh, I can't wait to try it.
-Yeah.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.636
So, what are you gonna do tonight
to celebrate?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.055
Mmm...

09:58.139 --> 09:59.932
I think, probably, I'll just...

10:00.016 --> 10:02.059
go out with some friends
from my Zumba class.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.730
You deserve to have fun.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.190
Thanks, Joan.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.867
Hello, Great Lengths, this is Joan.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.036
Hello?

10:21.912 --> 10:22.913
Hello?

10:23.456 --> 10:24.915
- Okay. Not the--
- No.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.876
- I know.
- I don't want any print.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.085
Okay. Nothing too busy.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.254
These are a lot of our warmer colors
over here.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.673
-Reds and pinks, and--
-No, I already have red.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.051
-I don't want red.
-...purples... Or yellows.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.137
-This is holiday, don't look at these.
-Sure. Okay.

10:38.220 --> 10:41.599
Um... oranges,
we have a good orange over here.

10:41.682 --> 10:42.600
Hmm.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.352
It's like a marigold.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.603
Not bad.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.189
We have these.
We have these nice, um...

10:48.272 --> 10:50.191
-Hmm.
-...sort of peachy golds.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.443
It's pretty, but the fabric wrinkles.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.570
-It's too wrinkly?
-Yeah, it's too wrinkly. Yeah.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.614
I-- You know,
this fabric will never wrinkle.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.324
It's darker. It's more of, like, a brick--

10:58.407 --> 11:00.534
Well, you said no red. But...

11:00.618 --> 11:02.078
Oh, this is the color.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.039
Yeah, the peach. It has the right energy.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.458
Colors have energy?

11:08.042 --> 11:10.211
Oh, absolutely. All colors have energy.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.546
And this is very protective.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.714
- It is?
-Yeah.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.383
It's good for my business, you know?

11:15.716 --> 11:17.510
It puts my customers at ease.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.761
Oh, cool.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.098
You know, I have a tarot business,
I read cards.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.100
Also, I read the Armenian cup.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.811
Do you... have husband?

11:26.894 --> 11:27.812
No.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.563
-No boyfriend?
-Mmm-mmm.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.607
No? You should come see me.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.943
-I'll give you discount. Here.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.112
This is my card.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.114
Oh, wow.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.241
Go ahead. Smell it.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.076
Mmm.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.536
This is protective, too.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.039
-Oh, cool. Thank you.
-Yes.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.458
So, this one?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.419
Yes. Eight yards.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.547
Hello, Great Lengths, this is Joan.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.133
Hello?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.137
A little tighter circle.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.680
There you go.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.725
Keep your back straight.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.643
You're kinda arched up a little bit.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.353
-There you go.
- Posture.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.896
That's pretty good form there.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.732
How's it feel?
Like you know what you're doing,

12:12.815 --> 12:14.817
or is that horse
still taking you for a ride?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.736
Yeah, I think I've got her.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.821
You-- Oh, you think?

12:18.904 --> 12:20.197
- I do.
- Oh, good.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.408
-Whoa.
- There you go.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.368
All right. We're done, Willow.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.495
Good work.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.624
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.377
Hi, darling.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.759
Hey, Emma, I noticed you were
a little distracted today.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.093
-Here. I'll get that.
-Oh.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.219
Just, uh...

12:42.303 --> 12:43.971
Just wanted to remind you, uh,

12:44.054 --> 12:46.140
how important it is to really
stay connected to Willow.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.516
You know, when you're distracted,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.185
-looking down, up, around...
- Yeah.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.519
...that's when accidents happen.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.772
I just got a text from my mom,
so I'm gonna...

12:52.855 --> 12:54.607
Okay, just wanna-- I'll take her tack off.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.608
Okay, cool.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.818
Okay.  Happy birthday!

12:58.569 --> 13:00.321
Happy birthday, beauty!

13:00.404 --> 13:01.739
Look what I made you.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.201
Look what I made you!

13:05.284 --> 13:07.244
Is that so pretty?

13:07.328 --> 13:09.830
Let's put that in your hair.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.332
Let's see.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.959
-Let's get that right in there. Oh!

13:14.043 --> 13:15.336
Isn't that nice?

13:15.419 --> 13:16.837
-Sarah?
-You look so pretty.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.130
Hi, Cheryl! Oh, Joe.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.215
Hey.

13:19.298 --> 13:23.135
I just made Willow this lanyard,
because we have the same birthday.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.386
So, it's our birthday today.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.097
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah. Looks really cool.

13:27.181 --> 13:30.684
Well, we don't wanna keep you.
Uh... so, uh, I can get her tack off.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.770
-Oh, I don't mind.
-That's all right. I got it.

13:32.853 --> 13:33.687
Go get some water.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.981
You look a little thirsty.
Go treat yourself.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.107
-Okay.
-Okay.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.027
Happy birthday, Willow!

13:40.110 --> 13:41.403
Okay. See ya.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.782
- Clap, tap! Clap, tap! Clap!

13:44.865 --> 13:47.451
Here we go. We're gonna get sexy.
Are you ready?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.703
- Sex it up. Here we go.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.707
Cha-cha, back, back, back.
Now, cha-cha, back, back, back.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.084
Sexy! Come on.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.211
Cha-cha-cha. You're sexy!

13:57.294 --> 13:59.964
And Grapevine! High clap, low krump.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.466
Here we go. Grapevine!

14:02.550 --> 14:05.469
High clap, low krump. And we spank!

14:07.346 --> 14:09.139
Very good! Yes!

14:09.223 --> 14:10.891
Yes! Yes! Yes!

14:10.975 --> 14:12.184
Very good!

14:27.825 --> 14:28.868
-Hey, Julie.
-Hi!

14:28.951 --> 14:30.077
Thanks for a great class.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.704
-Oh, you did such a good job.
-Thank you.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.621
Good energy.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.499
So, what are you up to tonight?
Have anything going on?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.502
No. I don't know.
Might hang out with some friends,

14:38.586 --> 14:40.129
or... you know.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.922
-Cool.  Cool.
- Yeah.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.718
Cool. Okay?
Well, I'll see you next week.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.428
-Okay. Bye-bye.
-Okay. Bye!

14:53.392 --> 14:55.311
<i>Please, Agatha.</i>
<i>Don't! It’s me. Darren.</i>

14:55.394 --> 14:57.897
<i>Don't listen to him!</i>
<i>He's just another clone.</i>

14:57.980 --> 14:59.815
<i>I'm Darren. The real Darren.</i>

14:59.899 --> 15:01.191
- <i>No, wait! </i>

15:01.275 --> 15:04.194
<i>You're always ten minutes late,</i>
<i>even if there's no traffic.</i>

15:04.278 --> 15:05.529
<i>You always eat dinner at 5:00.</i>

15:05.613 --> 15:06.614
<i>Whenever you're nervous,</i>

15:06.697 --> 15:08.532
<i>you get a cute little wrinkle</i>
<i>in your chin.</i>

15:09.909 --> 15:11.660
<i>Did you just say I was cute?</i>

15:11.744 --> 15:13.203
<i>I meant tiny. I didn't say cute.</i>

15:13.287 --> 15:15.247
<i>I didn't mean cute. I-- I meant tiny.</i>

15:15.331 --> 15:17.917
<i>He's trying</i>
<i>to seduce you. He's an incubus clone!</i>

15:18.000 --> 15:19.627
<i>Quick, Agatha, think!</i>

15:19.710 --> 15:22.838
<i>-Damn it!</i>
-<i> Speak...</i>

15:24.798 --> 15:26.216
<i>of the devil.</i>

15:27.551 --> 15:29.887
<i>Hades. I should've known.</i>

15:29.970 --> 15:31.013
<i>Mmm.</i>

15:31.639 --> 15:33.349
<i>Ooh. Ticktock, doll.</i>

15:35.100 --> 15:36.977
<i>You have one silver bullet,</i>

15:38.228 --> 15:40.606
<i>two targets, and three seconds</i>

15:40.689 --> 15:42.608
<i>until the prophecy shall be fulfilled.</i>

15:43.692 --> 15:45.402
<i>Now, without further ado...</i>

15:45.486 --> 15:46.528
Sarah. Hey.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.322
<i>...let the games begin.</i>

15:48.405 --> 15:49.239
Hey.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.617
You're here. I thought you were
going out for your birthday.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.244
Oh, those plans just fell through.

15:54.328 --> 15:57.331
So you're just gonna hang around here,
make more anklets?

15:58.415 --> 15:59.792
It's lanyard.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.086
Hey.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.299
We should do something. To celebrate.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.134
It's okay. It's late.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.511
Yeah. It is.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.595
It's 8:30.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.555
Come on, let's celebrate.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.391
Why don't you text your roommate?

16:15.474 --> 16:16.892
-Get him over here.
-Yeah.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.727
Oh, well, he's probably busy,
though, tonight.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.895
Text him.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.439
Yeah.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.858
This will be good.

16:25.442 --> 16:26.568
-Yay!
-Okay.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.071
Wanna get dressed?

16:30.531 --> 16:33.158
Okay. I got options.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.327
Oh. Uh, well, I sort of thought...

16:35.411 --> 16:36.662
I could wear this.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.247
Oh. Yeah.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.457
I like the waist.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.084
Let's go sexier.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.086
Show off your body.
You never do that.

16:46.755 --> 16:47.589
Um...

16:50.509 --> 16:54.013
I have this dress that...
was my grandmother's.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.639
Wow. It's really pretty.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.224
I would hate to ruin it.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.226
We might get messy tonight.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.602
Okay.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.981
Um, let's try something
more modern.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.150
Maybe this?

17:06.900 --> 17:07.985
Mmm...

17:08.777 --> 17:11.113
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.074
Okay.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.618
-Are these okay?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.911
-Yeah. Those are great.
-Okay.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.164
-Hey. Look at me. You look great.
-I look okay?

17:20.247 --> 17:21.331
Yeah. No, you look perfect.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.875
-Keep your bangs swept like that.
-Okay.

17:24.877 --> 17:25.878
Hey.

17:25.961 --> 17:26.837
What's up, man?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.422
-Hey, what's up, man?
-How's it going?

17:28.505 --> 17:30.049
Good, yeah. How are you?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.508
- Good.
- He's super sweet.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.054
- Thanks for inviting me.
-Sarah, Darren. Darren... that's Sarah.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.430
-Oh.
-Hi.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.639
-Hi.
-Uh, I'm Darren.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.934
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me?

17:41.018 --> 17:44.563
I-- I can't believe your name is Darren,
like <i>Purgatory.</i>

17:44.646 --> 17:47.733
Oh, yeah. I mean, I haven't seen it,
but, yeah, I know of it.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.360
-It's, like, the main character's name.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.780
- Maybe don't do that.
-It's, like, my favorite show.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.114
Cool. Yeah.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.366
-Do you want a drink?
-Yeah. No, that would be great.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.451
We can smoke blunts, too.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.871
Yeah, maybe I'll just start with the drink
and then see how that goes.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.081
-Okay.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.373
All right. Here you go.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.792
I really like your dress.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.376
Oh.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.753
I like your shirt.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.631
Oh, thanks, it's a...
Well, it's a sweater.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.007
It looks nice.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.468
Thanks. Yeah, your dress is,
like, a really pretty color.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.637
We don't have music.
We could listen to some of my music.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.388
Yeah. Or... any music.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.099
No, babe,
put your music on, it's so good.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.016
Yeah, it's fire.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.983
This is the fourth track now.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.402
Yeah. Uh.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.446
Yeah.
How many more tracks are there?

18:35.572 --> 18:36.615
Twelve total.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.700
That's why I'm calling it
"A Baker's Dozen."

18:38.784 --> 18:40.160
It's a concept album.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.664
Right. So, don't you mean 13?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.916
Is there, like,
a bonus track or something?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.877
No. "Baker's Dozen." Dozen's 12.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.631
Yeah, it's a concept album...
once again, so...

18:52.714 --> 18:55.217
I'm sorry, have you guys
ever been to a bakery?

18:55.300 --> 18:58.762
Yeah. Duh.
Like, yes. We've been to a bakery.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.808
Then you'd understand
a baker's dozen's 13.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.143
It's a concept album.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.477
-Not talking about the album.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.313
I'm talking about when you go
to the bakery and you order 12...

19:08.397 --> 19:10.732
like, a dozen,
they give you the extra one

19:10.816 --> 19:12.651
as, like, a treat. Like, you did good.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.111
What bakery?

19:14.194 --> 19:15.195
All bakeries.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.865
Oh. I get what you're saying.
No, but that's semantics.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.994
It's nice to, uh, be, like...
be out of my house and stuff,

19:22.077 --> 19:23.829
and hanging out, and...

19:24.454 --> 19:26.456
talking to, uh, a woman...

19:26.540 --> 19:28.208
-...again.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.336
I feel like
I'm just starting to,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.213
like, feel like myself again, you know?

19:34.214 --> 19:37.634
It's like, when you're in a relationship,
like, everything is so dictated

19:37.718 --> 19:39.970
by what your partner does, you know?

19:40.053 --> 19:41.430
-Yeah.
-This is gonna sound weird,

19:41.513 --> 19:43.599
but, like, my ex-girlfriend would...

19:44.183 --> 19:45.517
like, pick out my clothes.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.061
-Yeah.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.522
Like, if I would leave the room
wearing what I wanted to wear,

19:50.606 --> 19:51.565
she would scream, like,

19:51.648 --> 19:54.860
"Get back in there and, like,
put on the outfit I chose for you." And...

19:55.986 --> 19:59.531
I, like, found myself wearing,
like, purple all the time.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.284
And I had these,
like, brown leather bracelets.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.454
I was like, "Why am I wearing, like,
ten brown leather bracelets?"

20:05.537 --> 20:07.164
Like, I don't like jewelry.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.790
Like, I didn't grow up wearing jewelry,

20:08.874 --> 20:11.585
let alone, like,
brown leather and, like...

20:11.668 --> 20:14.087
Like, she would never
call me her boyfriend.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.798
Like, we dated for two and a half years,

20:16.882 --> 20:18.383
and she would never
call me her boyfriend.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.845
Like, I would go to her reunions
and meet her extended family and stuff,

20:21.929 --> 20:24.264
and she'd be like,
"This is Darren, my friend."

20:24.348 --> 20:26.183
Oh, my God.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.310
I don't know. It just
really made me feel like shit.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.312
Like, "I've been dating you for so..."

20:31.104 --> 20:32.439

Hey, happy birthday.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.312
-Um...
-Thanks.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.440
Yeah. Thanks for letting me
share it with you.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.817
I really liked that.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.735
-Totally?
-Yeah.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.781
Um... it was really nice to meet you.

23:28.907 --> 23:29.908
You, too.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.703
Hopefully I'll see you, uh, around?

23:33.787 --> 23:34.746
Definitely.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.791
All right. Bye.

23:37.874 --> 23:38.875
Bye.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.022
Whoa.

24:42.814 --> 24:43.815
What the hell?

24:44.649 --> 24:45.484
Yo.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.743
-Hey. Good morning.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.454
Oh! Hey.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.081
What's this?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.709
Oh, you were wilding out.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.336
Do you know what happened to the wall?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.213
Those scratches?

25:08.840 --> 25:09.716
I don't know.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.511
Maybe call a handyman, get it fixed,
just before the landlord sees it.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.720
Okay.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.097
I'm sorry, I don't remember--

25:16.181 --> 25:17.474
No. It's okay.

25:17.557 --> 25:18.850
Just get it fixed.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.395
Have a good day.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.804
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.305
Remember me from, uh, last night?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:59.849 --> 26:00.934
I just came to get my car,

26:01.017 --> 26:02.727
and I, uh, was thinking about you,

26:02.811 --> 26:04.437
and wanted to see if I could, uh,

26:04.521 --> 26:05.480
have your number,

26:06.064 --> 26:08.900
and maybe I could take you on a date.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.445
Yeah.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.655
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.031
Yeah. Okay.

26:15.615 --> 26:19.327
Whew. Okay, good. Yeah. Sorry, uh...
Do you wanna just put your number in?

26:19.411 --> 26:20.912
-I'll put it in.
-Yeah. Sorry.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.790
Nervous as hell, I don't really--
I haven't done that in a while, so...

26:23.873 --> 26:24.708
Yeah.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.459
And everything's, like, all online now,

26:26.543 --> 26:28.253
so it's so nice to meet someone in person.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.005
Like, there's something
so exciting about you,

26:30.088 --> 26:31.881
and I was thinking about you,
and...

26:31.965 --> 26:33.633
-...seeing the dress again, I'm like...
-Oh.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.844
It's just as pretty, uh, today.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.762
So... Yeah. Um...

26:37.846 --> 26:40.348
Okay, so... I'll just...
call or text you, or...

26:40.432 --> 26:42.434
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay. Okay.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.312
So, um, okay. So, then I guess, uh...

26:46.730 --> 26:48.356
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.691
Okay. Thank you for this. Bye.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.192
-Okay. Bye.
-Sarah. Bye.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.862
<i>I love this gradient yarn.</i>

26:53.945 --> 26:55.030
Oh, yeah.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.949
-It's so cool.
-It's so pretty!

26:58.033 --> 27:00.368
So, did you hang out with
your Zumba friends last night?

27:01.202 --> 27:02.203
Mmm-hmm.

27:02.287 --> 27:06.499
Yeah, everyone just came over
and we sort of had a little party.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.209
Oh.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.253
And I... met a guy.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.297
Sarah!

27:12.797 --> 27:14.507
-What?

27:14.591 --> 27:15.717
Yeah, he just came over

27:15.800 --> 27:19.012
because he's roommates with
my roommate's boyfriend, Brian,

27:19.095 --> 27:21.097
so he just came over with him.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.099
And we just...

27:23.600 --> 27:25.018
hung out all night, and...

27:25.101 --> 27:29.606
and talked and talked and talked,
and, um... he's so nice.

27:30.106 --> 27:30.982
What's his name?

27:31.608 --> 27:34.402
His name is Darren. Like, from <i>Purgatory.</i>

27:35.195 --> 27:36.071
Interesting.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.280
And then...

27:37.364 --> 27:41.034
Well, he actually...
He came back over this morning

27:41.117 --> 27:43.620
and asked me out on a date-date.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.372
-Like, a real date.
-Whoa.

27:45.955 --> 27:47.707
This is serious. He really likes you.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.002
I'm happy for you, Sarah.

27:55.382 --> 27:59.511
Oh, no, they sent
these weird agate chunks again.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.472
Oh, I don't like those agates.
Nobody's gonna buy them.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.391
I told them "round."

28:06.601 --> 28:10.063
Oh. Oh, no. Oh. Joan!

28:10.605 --> 28:11.439
Oh, no.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.608
-Oh, I'm sorry, it got--
- Oh, my goodness!

28:13.692 --> 28:14.693
Oh, here. I have a tissue.

28:14.776 --> 28:18.029
Here, take this.
Now keep your head forward, it'll help.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.447
-Oh, forward?
-No, forward.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.532
It'll stop the bleeding.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.033
Okay. I'm sorry.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.578
I think I'm probably just
dehydrated from drinking.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.623
Poor guy.

28:36.631 --> 28:38.550
Great Lengths, this is Joan,
can I help you?

28:39.426 --> 28:42.178
Hello? Hello?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.556
-Take another selfie, huh?

28:44.639 --> 28:46.516
To Satico, god of technology.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.477
13,000 years at the center
of a polar orbit.

28:50.311 --> 28:54.399
While I wait for someone to stop him...

29:05.577 --> 29:07.328
- Hi!
-Hi!

29:08.621 --> 29:11.124
-How are you doing?
- Good. How are you?

29:11.207 --> 29:13.793
Good. Thank you for coming.
It makes her so happy.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.212
It makes me happy, too.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.213
How you doing?

29:17.297 --> 29:18.465
Good! Everything's good.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.382
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.968
Heather, Sarah's here!

29:22.051 --> 29:23.052
Coming!

29:23.136 --> 29:25.096
So, she had a really good week,
no seizures,

29:25.180 --> 29:27.974
but if anything happens,
she's got her meds in her pocket,

29:28.057 --> 29:30.769
and, um, yeah, just text me or whatever.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.645
Okay. We'll probably just take a walk.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.190
-Oh. Fun.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.108
Oh. Hi!

29:37.192 --> 29:39.903
-Sarah! Hi.
-Hey. Hi.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.946
You look so pretty!

29:42.030 --> 29:44.783
You look pretty.
Your hair is getting so long.

29:44.866 --> 29:45.950
Thanks. I'm growing it out.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.952
Um...

29:48.745 --> 29:49.996
I made you this.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.956
-You did?
-It's an anklet.

29:52.540 --> 29:55.668
So, your mom said
you got a new job at the market?

29:55.752 --> 29:58.129
Well, it's actually this--
It's at the same market.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.840
-Mmm-hmm.
-But, um, I was so excited to tell you.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.968
Um, they actually moved me
to the bakery.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.512
That's so cool!

30:05.595 --> 30:06.679
Thanks.

30:06.763 --> 30:07.680
Are you baking?

30:07.764 --> 30:09.933
Yeah, well, they're having...

30:15.772 --> 30:16.815
Because...

30:18.525 --> 30:21.069
It's because I'm so friendly.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.571
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.489
Thank you.

30:24.572 --> 30:25.907
That's cool.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.118
Do you have a boyfriend?

30:31.913 --> 30:34.999
-Yeah. Kind of.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.960
I kind of have a new boyfriend.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.212
-You do?
-Yeah, his name is Darren.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.588
He's, like, really nice.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.966
Oh, my gosh.
That's so cool.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.303
What color is his hair?

30:47.971 --> 30:50.348
-It's brown.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.599
Just like Willow?

30:52.350 --> 30:55.478
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, kind of.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.413
Do you have a boyfriend?

31:17.292 --> 31:18.835
- Bye.
-Bye!

31:19.544 --> 31:21.004
- I love you.
-I love you.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.715
-It was so fun.
- It was so fun.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.092
Okay. Thanks. Come by again, okay?

31:26.175 --> 31:28.469
-You gotta come visit me in the bakery.
-It means so much to her.

31:28.553 --> 31:32.140
Okay, yes. Definitely, I will. Bye.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.601
- Bye, sweetie. Take care.
- Bye!

33:19.706 --> 33:20.999
Jeez, you scared me.

33:21.082 --> 33:24.085
I crashed at Brian's, his power went out.
My phone died.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.045
My alarm didn't go off, so I'm fucked.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.881
I thought you were here.
I-- I heard you guys last night.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.426
What? No.
We were at Brian's all night.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.720
-I heard your voices.
-Did you call the handyman about this yet?

33:33.803 --> 33:36.055
-No, not yet.
-I need you to do that. Please?

33:36.723 --> 33:37.807
Okay.

33:38.599 --> 33:39.642
-Bye!

33:57.952 --> 33:59.454
<i>Police department.</i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

33:59.537 --> 34:02.790
<i>Um, yes, hi.</i>
<i>I'm calling to report a stolen vehicle.</i>

34:02.874 --> 34:04.500
<i>What's the make and model of your vehicle?</i>

34:04.584 --> 34:08.337
It's a 1991 Volvo 240. It's gold.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.548
Um, the license plate is...

34:11.299 --> 34:13.885
GCQ-4457.

34:13.968 --> 34:15.094
It has a sunroof.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.971
I had the club locked on it.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.681
I don't know how this could've happened.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.059
-Hey, can you give me a ride to work?
-I'm late!

34:23.686 --> 34:25.271
-Mmm... Yeah, the--

34:25.354 --> 34:27.482
Oh. Shit. Sorry, um...

34:27.565 --> 34:28.858
Can you hold on one sec?

34:30.735 --> 34:31.611
Hello?

34:33.696 --> 34:34.655
Hello?

34:36.282 --> 34:38.826
<i>Hello? Sarah?</i>
<i>Can-- Can you hear me?</i>

34:38.910 --> 34:39.827
Hi. Yeah. Gary?

34:39.911 --> 34:43.039
<i>I just got-- I have this hands-free thing,</i>
<i>I didn't even know if it would work.</i>

34:43.122 --> 34:46.250
<i>Listen, I just got a call from a tow yard,</i>

34:46.334 --> 34:47.543
<i>they have your car.</i>

34:47.627 --> 34:49.420
Oh, my God. That is great news.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.090
I'm just on the other line
reporting it stolen.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.925
<i>I guess it's still under my name.</i>

34:54.008 --> 34:55.885
<i>I can come pick you up.</i>
<i>You wanna go get it?</i>

34:55.968 --> 34:58.304
Yes. Gary, thank you so much.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.263
<i>Okay. Uh, yeah.</i>

34:59.347 --> 35:01.516
<i>-All right. I'll see you in a little bit.</i>
<i>-</i>Okay. Thank you.

35:04.894 --> 35:05.895
Hello?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.272
Oh, shoot.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.779
-Hey!
-Hi.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.239
Hi.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.825
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.203
Sorry. I don't know what happened.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.705
The gates were closed
and I locked the club and everything--

35:24.789 --> 35:25.873
Don't even worry about it.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.625
It's all taken care of. You're good.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.710
-And, uh... here.
-Oh.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.420
Happy belated birthday.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.842
I didn't know what to get you,
so I figured this way you can...

35:35.925 --> 35:37.510
get whatever you want,

35:37.593 --> 35:39.887
-and get yourself something nice.
- Oh, Gary.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.347
-You know...
-Thank-- Thank you.

35:41.430 --> 35:42.849
You have it. Sure.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.560
And I feel bad, I-- I'm sorry.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.895
I haven't really been around lately.
It's been...

35:47.979 --> 35:49.438
just, you know, a bit crazy with...

35:49.522 --> 35:51.232
-with everything, and--
-It's okay.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.610
No. It's not, but... How have you been?

35:55.319 --> 35:58.114
Yeah, I've been good.
I've been, um, going by to see Mom

35:58.197 --> 36:00.908
and making sure
the grave's all clean and nice.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.410
Nice.

36:04.370 --> 36:07.165
Let's, uh...
Let's go take care of this, okay?

36:07.248 --> 36:08.249
Yeah.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.545
You were really, really lucky.
The car was blocking traffic.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.964
They left it in the middle of the street
with no gas.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.008
Where was it?

36:17.758 --> 36:18.926
By the water place.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.261
The water place?

36:20.511 --> 36:22.138
-The tanks. The water--
- Yeah, yeah.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.347
-Water plant.
-Yellow tanks.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.892
-Oh, those tanks.
-It was green, but yeah. They'll--

36:25.975 --> 36:28.227
But you know, I don't think
this car was stolen,

36:28.311 --> 36:30.730
because the key was in the ignition
and it was turned right.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.857
So I believe
they just left the car running

36:32.940 --> 36:34.150
and they ran out of gas.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.067
Detective.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.694
-Gonna need your signature.
-You know,

36:36.777 --> 36:38.988
I saw that on, uh, <i>Columbo</i> once.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.406
-Sign right here.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.119
All right.
Really appreciate the call.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.747
By the way, we put some gas in it.
It's included on the bill.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.041
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
-Let me give you the receipt.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.168
Okay, thank you. Here, sweetie.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.588
Thanks, Gary. I really appreciate it.

36:55.671 --> 36:56.631
Of course.

36:56.714 --> 36:59.091
-I'm so sorry, I... It's weird.
-No. Hey.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.302
Car looks like it's in one piece.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.887
-You're okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.889
You need anything?
Do you need any more money?

37:04.972 --> 37:06.933
No, no.  No. Thank you.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.809
-You tell me if you do.
-Okay.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.020
Hey, Gary...

37:12.021 --> 37:17.944
How old was Mom when she...
started acting like Helen?

37:18.027 --> 37:20.029
She never acted like Helen. No.

37:20.112 --> 37:23.616
Helen was... you know,
she was talking to walls. That...

37:23.908 --> 37:27.411
Your mom was... She struggled.
She struggled sometimes.

37:27.828 --> 37:30.248
Things became a little too much, you know?

37:31.582 --> 37:32.416
Why? Are you--

37:32.500 --> 37:34.877
No. No.  No.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.170
Thanks. Love you.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.507
Yeah. Hey. Happy belated birthday.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.467
All right, sweetie.

37:45.763 --> 37:48.683
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

37:49.767 --> 37:50.851
Hyah, boy.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.853
- Oh. Hey, Joe!
-Hyah!

37:53.980 --> 37:56.315
Oh, hey there.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.401
So, Emma's not taking Willow out today?

37:58.484 --> 38:00.778
No, she's out of town. Out of town. Hyah!

38:00.861 --> 38:02.154
You want me to take her out?

38:02.238 --> 38:04.240
No. No. We're good. We're good.

38:04.323 --> 38:05.574
-I mean, I'm here.
-Hyah!

38:05.658 --> 38:08.035
I don't mind.
Happy to give her some exercise.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.954
You know what,
it's kind of an insurance thing,

38:10.037 --> 38:11.789
and she's not your horse anymore.

38:11.872 --> 38:15.835
Well, I'll just go by and... say hi
and give her a little brush.

38:15.918 --> 38:18.004
Yeah. Okay.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.131
Okay. Thanks, Joe.

38:20.756 --> 38:22.842
Okay. Hyah!

38:26.053 --> 38:27.638
Hi, Willow.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.224
Hi, beauty.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.186
You gonna get a little rest today?

38:44.655 --> 38:46.032
-Hey, Joe?
-Hey.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.993
-Willow's not wearing the--
-Oh! Wanna step outside, please? Thanks.

38:49.076 --> 38:53.122
Sorry. Um... Willow's not wearing
that lanyard I made her.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.374
-Do you know what happened to it?
-What's that, now?

38:55.458 --> 38:56.792
Remember, a couple of days ago,

38:56.876 --> 38:58.753
I-- I made her that lanyard
for our birthdays?

38:58.836 --> 39:00.338
But I-- I can't find it.

39:00.421 --> 39:03.632
You know, I don't know what that...
I'm sure it'll turn up, though.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.219
Okay.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.430
-I'll see you around.
-Yeah, all right.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.005
What the fuck?

41:51.175 --> 41:54.762
Hi. Sorry. I think I was sleepwalking,
'cause my mom used to say

41:54.845 --> 41:56.972
-that I have an overactive imagin--

41:58.140 --> 41:59.183
Good night.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.252
<i>Ah, I took her for a walk.</i>

42:26.335 --> 42:29.713
<i>I distinctly remember the clock saying</i>
<i>it was 6:00 p.m.,</i>

42:29.797 --> 42:32.883
<i>and saying hey to my neighbor Glenn</i>
<i>who was on his porch.</i>

42:32.967 --> 42:35.678
<i>And this was in the winter,</i>
<i>so, you know, it was...</i>

42:35.761 --> 42:36.804
<i>it was dark outside already.</i>

42:36.887 --> 42:40.474
<i>I came home, fed her, looked out</i>
<i>the window, and bam, it was light outside.</i>

42:40.558 --> 42:43.352
<i>I looked at the clock again</i>
<i>and it said 5:00 p.m.</i>

42:43.435 --> 42:44.353
<i>Wow.</i>

42:44.436 --> 42:48.232
<i>Yeah. In my book, I interview</i>
<i>several people with similar incidents</i>

42:48.315 --> 42:50.401
<i>that don't jive</i>
<i>with our notions of reality.</i>

42:50.484 --> 42:51.777
<i>So, aliens?</i>

42:51.860 --> 42:54.738
<i>That's certainly one explanation.</i>
<i>Alien abductions.</i>

42:54.822 --> 42:57.324
<i>Accidentally slipping</i>
<i>into parallel universes.</i>

42:57.408 --> 42:58.576
<i>-Thought control.</i>

43:03.330 --> 43:06.542
30% employee discount just for you.

43:07.334 --> 43:08.335
Thank you.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.880
You're welcome. So, uh, Shannon's
not here yet, but before she gets in,

43:11.964 --> 43:13.549
would you mind taking a look at the glue?

43:13.632 --> 43:15.801
She did it yesterday,
but it's just a little...

43:16.885 --> 43:18.762
Are... Are you okay?

43:20.556 --> 43:22.641
I don't know. Um...

43:22.725 --> 43:25.561
I just
haven't been sleeping very well.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.479
That's too bad.

43:27.563 --> 43:30.024
Yeah, I've been having,
like, really weird dreams.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.483
Really? About what?

43:31.567 --> 43:34.236
Um... I don't know. Like...

43:35.195 --> 43:38.115
Like, I've been seeing the same people
over and over again.

43:38.699 --> 43:43.329
And, like, these strange places
I've never been before.

43:44.496 --> 43:48.250
And I don't know how to describe it,
it just feels really weird.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.127
And, like, really scary.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.712
That's horrible.

43:51.795 --> 43:55.716
And, like... I've been having,
like, weird things with time.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.052
Weird things with time?

43:58.135 --> 44:02.014
Like, finding myself places
and I don't know how I got there.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.808
What... What does that mean, exactly?

44:04.892 --> 44:07.394
Like, last night, I was gone for,
like, 25 minutes,

44:07.478 --> 44:08.687
and when I looked at the clock,

44:08.771 --> 44:10.856
it showed that
only two minutes had passed.

44:10.939 --> 44:14.526
So, like, I did some research online,
and people talk about, um,

44:15.027 --> 44:17.738
carbon monoxide poisoning,
but I just don't think it's that.

44:17.821 --> 44:22.159
And then they also talk about, um,
alien abductions. Do you believe in that?

44:22.242 --> 44:23.452
Mmm...

44:24.286 --> 44:26.497
No, I... Not really.

44:26.580 --> 44:27.623
No?

44:28.791 --> 44:32.002
Do you think this sounds similar to
some of the stuff your mom went through?

44:33.671 --> 44:34.505
No.

44:34.588 --> 44:36.674
Maybe you should talk to a doctor, Sarah.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.426
You know, get a professional opinion.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.221
-What do you think?
-Maybe.

44:43.847 --> 44:45.808
Joan!
That's the guy from my dream.

44:46.684 --> 44:47.518
Really?

44:47.601 --> 44:48.644
Yes!

44:52.690 --> 44:56.318
Turn it all off.
It'll be the Dark Ages again!

44:57.111 --> 44:57.945
"Santiaguez."

44:58.028 --> 45:00.447
We'll all be gone except for those
that are Sectilians that are...

45:00.531 --> 45:05.994
that are in cahoots with Satico Satellite!
God of technology!

45:06.662 --> 45:09.206
Sits at the right hand of Zeus!

45:09.289 --> 45:11.583
Powering all your electronic devices!

45:11.667 --> 45:15.504
Light bulbs! Email!
Internet! Satico Satellite...

45:15.587 --> 45:18.257
-Tap. Good. Tap. Great! Tap.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.175
Excellent! Good. Very good!

45:20.259 --> 45:22.886
Yes! Sweat out those margaritas!

45:22.970 --> 45:26.515
Let's cha-cha!
Back, back, back, and cha-cha!

45:26.598 --> 45:28.767
Back, back, back, and pump, pump.

45:28.851 --> 45:33.355
Double. Now, pump, pump. Double.
Good! Keep pulling! Yes!

45:33.439 --> 45:36.650
Match that hip to your fist.
Very good.

45:38.068 --> 45:38.902
Okay.

45:46.326 --> 45:47.661
Hi. Can I help you?

46:06.597 --> 46:08.098
Do you remember me?

46:09.057 --> 46:10.768
Have you used us before?

46:14.271 --> 46:16.482
I just wanted to talk to you.

46:17.649 --> 46:21.904
Okay. About... plumbing? HVAC?

46:22.654 --> 46:23.530
Plumbing.

46:24.364 --> 46:26.283
Kitchen? Bathroom?

46:26.867 --> 46:27.910
Kitchen.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.037
Pipes. I need new pipes.

46:31.413 --> 46:32.873
All right. Pipes.

46:32.956 --> 46:34.666
Is that expensive?

46:34.750 --> 46:37.503
Depends on the work.
It's hard to tell until I check it out.

46:39.254 --> 46:43.050
Oh, you could come and check it out?
I have money.

46:43.133 --> 46:46.512
Oh, well, that's usually
not necessary until I'm...

46:46.595 --> 46:48.096
- Here.
-...at the job. Oh, okay.

46:48.180 --> 46:50.140
Yeah. Sure.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.142
Great. So you'll come
check it out tonight?

46:52.226 --> 46:55.020
Well, we're almost closed
and dispatch is gone, so, um...

46:55.687 --> 46:57.898
I can probably squeeze you in
in the morning, though.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.026
In the morning. Tomorrow morning. Great.
So you'll come tomorrow morning?

47:01.109 --> 47:03.362
You really
want those pipes, huh?

47:03.445 --> 47:04.363
Yeah.

47:05.405 --> 47:10.077
All righty. I'll... just need
some information.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.078
Your name?

47:13.288 --> 47:14.581
Agatha Kaine.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.214
- Okay.
-Tomorrow, then?

47:22.297 --> 47:24.925
Yeah. Just need your address
and phone number.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.343
Okay.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.161
<i>One... Mississippi.</i>

47:54.913 --> 47:55.998
<i>Please, don't.</i>

47:56.081 --> 47:58.625
<i>Two... Mississippi.</i>

48:00.043 --> 48:01.628
<i>Listen to your heart, Agatha.</i>

48:03.505 --> 48:08.093
<i>Three...</i>  <i>Mississippi.</i>

48:25.068 --> 48:26.153
Clones.

48:53.013 --> 48:56.433
Hey, Miss Kaine. I'm Tom
from Santiaguez Plumbing.

48:57.559 --> 48:58.393
Oh.

49:00.604 --> 49:03.857
Yeah. It's good we're replacing
this old galvanized pipe.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.151
It's got tons of sclerosis.

49:06.234 --> 49:07.736
Oh. Those are better?

49:07.819 --> 49:09.488
Yeah. Copper's the best.

49:11.531 --> 49:14.618
So, like, are you friends with
any of the people you work with?

49:16.703 --> 49:17.829
I don't know.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.832
We get beers, like,
once a month or something.

49:21.583 --> 49:23.919
What about the guy
who made me this appointment?

49:24.503 --> 49:26.922
That would be Ron. One of the owners.

49:28.674 --> 49:29.925
He's one of the owners.

49:31.009 --> 49:32.344
Does he work every day?

49:32.427 --> 49:34.888
Yeah. Yeah,
he's pretty much there all day.

49:37.307 --> 49:40.143
Has he ever told you about
anything weird that's happened to him?

49:40.227 --> 49:41.853
-That's like--

49:44.064 --> 49:46.066
What? What is this? What's happening?

49:46.149 --> 49:47.985
Hi. Nothing.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.528
- What is going on?
-Nothing.

49:49.611 --> 49:51.488
What is he-- Hi. What are you doing?

49:51.571 --> 49:54.282
He's just replacing the pipes
because we needed new pipes,

49:54.366 --> 49:55.409
our pipes are really old.

49:55.492 --> 49:57.327
-You're replacing the pipes?
-Yeah, and I paid for them!

49:58.203 --> 50:01.873
We're renting. I asked you to fix
the scratches on the wall.

50:01.957 --> 50:03.208
We don't need new plumbing.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.795
Mmm. Can you just
put it back how it was?

50:08.505 --> 50:11.299
Miss Kaine, I-- I don't know if
I'm authorized to do that, I mean--

50:11.383 --> 50:12.259
Miss Kaine?

50:12.342 --> 50:14.886
- Plus, they're all gunked up--
- What did you call her? What?

50:15.929 --> 50:17.014
Agatha Kaine?

50:17.097 --> 50:19.725
- Listen.
-Are you using an alias?

50:19.808 --> 50:21.685
Listen. Everything's fine.

50:21.768 --> 50:24.062
He's gonna finish doing the floors,
and I already paid for it,

50:24.146 --> 50:25.814
and he's gonna put the floor back
the way it was.

50:25.897 --> 50:27.649
And I-- I even called the guy
about the walls,

50:27.733 --> 50:31.570
and he said he can't come until next week,
so, it's-- it's all taken care of.

50:34.156 --> 50:36.533
Fine. This is fucking insane.

50:41.621 --> 50:43.415
So, is Ron working tonight?

53:59.736 --> 54:02.239
Okay. Here we go, now.

54:03.448 --> 54:05.617
-It's gonna sting just a little bit.

54:05.700 --> 54:08.703
And... And there we go.

54:09.579 --> 54:12.499
All done. Great. I think we got it.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.167
-You did great.
-Oh, good.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.460
-Thank you.
-Okay.

54:17.295 --> 54:21.007
Um... And if...
If I should get another nosebleed,

54:21.091 --> 54:24.010
should I lean my head back
or should I lean it forward?

54:24.094 --> 54:25.428
Yeah, always forward.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.138
Because if you lean your head back,

54:27.222 --> 54:30.475
then the blood is gonna flow
down the back of your throat,

54:30.558 --> 54:32.269
and then you'll get nauseous and throw up,

54:32.352 --> 54:34.354
and you don't want that to happen.

54:34.437 --> 54:36.648
- Okay.
-Okay? Good.

54:36.731 --> 54:41.236
Um... And I've been having
a little trouble sleeping,

54:41.319 --> 54:43.571
'cause I've been having
these really weird dreams,

54:43.655 --> 54:45.615
and I've been kind of scared
to go to sleep.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.535
-Uh-huh.
-And now I have some bruises on my body.

54:48.618 --> 54:50.245
Do you know what that could be from?

54:52.580 --> 54:54.374
Well, um, you know,

54:54.457 --> 54:56.626
a bruise like that
could really be from anything.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.838
You might've bumped into something,
even if you didn't know that you did.

54:59.921 --> 55:02.882
Uh, you know what would be
a good idea, Sarah, for you?

55:02.966 --> 55:05.969
I think you should get, uh,
some blood work done through your GP,

55:06.052 --> 55:09.931
um, and ask them to test for, uh, anemia.

55:10.015 --> 55:12.600
Um... Partly because of the, uh...

55:13.184 --> 55:14.811
the nosebleeds you've been having.

55:14.894 --> 55:16.146
-Mmm-hmm.
-And, um,

55:16.229 --> 55:17.981
if there's any coagulation problem,

55:18.064 --> 55:20.692
that could-- that could tell you
something about the bruises as well.

55:20.775 --> 55:21.609
Okay?

55:21.693 --> 55:23.361
-Okay.
-All right. Okay. Good.

55:23.945 --> 55:28.325
Is there also a test, um,
like, to see if I'm a clone?

55:29.451 --> 55:30.452
Uh, I'm sorry?

55:30.910 --> 55:33.580
Um, just a test to see
if I'm, like, a clone?

55:34.289 --> 55:36.541
A clone?

55:36.624 --> 55:39.794
Well, I guess the one way
to do that is we'd, uh,

55:39.878 --> 55:41.671
take your DNA test,

55:41.755 --> 55:45.258
and we'd take the DNA test
of the other person,

55:45.342 --> 55:47.177
and if they match,

55:47.260 --> 55:49.137
then you've got a clone.

55:50.513 --> 55:51.890
That's the only way I know.

55:52.682 --> 55:55.352
Well, just 'cause I've been watching
season five of <i>Purgatory</i>

55:55.435 --> 55:57.771
where Darren becomes a clone, and...

55:58.313 --> 55:59.939
it just sort of got me thinking

56:00.023 --> 56:02.484
that, like, I look so much
like my grandma,

56:02.567 --> 56:06.446
and I have all these old photos of her,
and, like, we look exactly the same,

56:06.529 --> 56:09.616
and I can even sort of
make the face she makes in the photos,

56:09.699 --> 56:12.786
and, like... uh...
So, that would make sense,

56:12.869 --> 56:17.165
'cause... I didn't know her.
She was gone before I was born.

56:17.248 --> 56:18.917
So maybe they would have
needed her body

56:19.000 --> 56:22.212
to, like, recycle it into me
if I was a clone of her.

56:22.295 --> 56:25.965
And I don't know who...
would be doing it, like...

56:26.633 --> 56:29.219
it could be the government,
or demons, or...

56:29.302 --> 56:31.805
um, immortal alchemists,
like Dee on <i>Purgatory.</i>

56:32.430 --> 56:36.017
I just wanted to see
if maybe we could, um, test for that.

56:36.101 --> 56:38.269
Uh, yeah. Um, Sarah, I'm...

56:38.353 --> 56:42.482
I'm an ear, nose, and throat specialist,
that's my area of expertise.

56:43.066 --> 56:46.361
So, I don't really know a lot
about some of this other stuff.

56:46.444 --> 56:49.072
It doesn't sound very likely to me.

56:49.155 --> 56:52.033
And I'm not familiar with <i>Purgatory,</i>

56:52.117 --> 56:53.618
uh, whatever you mentioned, the series.

56:53.701 --> 56:57.997
Um... You know what might be a good idea,
is for you to, uh, talk to someone,

56:58.081 --> 57:00.208
to talk to a psychologist and--

57:00.291 --> 57:01.626
-Never mind.
-No, and tell them--

57:01.709 --> 57:03.837
Okay. That's okay. Um...

57:03.920 --> 57:05.922
-I'm so sorry. Thank you.
- Mmm.

57:06.005 --> 57:08.174
Um, okay. Thank you. Bye.

57:25.692 --> 57:26.609
Hey.

57:26.693 --> 57:27.819
Hi.

57:28.987 --> 57:29.988
You look beautiful.

57:30.613 --> 57:31.573
So do you.

57:33.616 --> 57:34.451
Thanks.

57:36.369 --> 57:38.371
- I just wanna say, um...

57:39.205 --> 57:42.792
I am so sorry for talking about my ex
for so long the other night.

57:42.876 --> 57:43.793
It's okay.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.587
No. No, no. It's not. I mean...

57:45.670 --> 57:47.422
It's, like, the lamest thing
that I could do,

57:47.505 --> 57:51.259
and I don't wanna give you the impression
that I'm, like, hung up on my ex.

57:51.342 --> 57:53.344
'Cause I'm not. I'm not, and it--

57:53.428 --> 57:56.097
I've really enjoyed
spending time with you, and...

57:56.848 --> 57:57.849
that's where my head's at.

57:57.932 --> 57:59.309
I totally get it.

57:59.893 --> 58:02.479
Like... after my mom died,

58:02.562 --> 58:05.440
I, like, rewatched
every episode of <i>Purgatory,</i>

58:05.523 --> 58:08.318
like, every season, and, um...

58:09.110 --> 58:11.821
it just, like, really comforted me.

58:14.032 --> 58:16.951
Like, I don't think it's a coincidence
that your name is Darren.

58:17.035 --> 58:19.078
Yeah.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.125
I'm sorry to hear about your mom.

58:24.709 --> 58:27.253
But, uh, I'm glad that you had the show
to keep you company,

58:27.337 --> 58:30.089
'cause... I know how hard that can be.

58:34.302 --> 58:36.012
And, like,
I wanted to tell you that, um,

58:36.095 --> 58:38.348
you don't have to worry about me
getting nosebleeds ever again,

58:38.431 --> 58:42.268
because, um, I went to the doctor
and I got my nose fixed.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.523
Uh... I thought
the nosebleed was cute, but...

58:46.606 --> 58:47.899
Well, I'm glad you got it fixed.

58:47.982 --> 58:49.526
-So, that's great.
-Yeah, it is great,

58:49.609 --> 58:52.070
except I'll never be seeing
that doctor again, so...

58:52.153 --> 58:53.488
Why? What happened?

58:54.113 --> 58:55.156
He's just, like, a jerk.

58:55.740 --> 58:57.242
He, like, make fun of you or something?

59:00.703 --> 59:02.914
I was just, like, talking about him about

59:02.997 --> 59:05.708
the paranormal and stuff, and, like,

59:05.792 --> 59:07.544
he just made me feel like such an idiot

59:07.627 --> 59:09.754
-for even bringing it up, and--
-What an asshole.

59:09.837 --> 59:14.092
I mean, a doctor's whole job
is to make a patient feel good, right?

59:15.093 --> 59:16.844
I mean, I think the paranormal's cool.

59:16.928 --> 59:18.680
Like, ghosts and aliens and stuff.

59:19.138 --> 59:19.973
You do?

59:20.056 --> 59:22.350
I was reading something the other day
that was, like, uh...

59:22.433 --> 59:24.644
It was about how the ancients
built the pyramids.

59:24.727 --> 59:26.896
You know? And they built
two identical pyramids,

59:26.980 --> 59:30.191
but on opposite sides of the world.
It's like, "How did that happen?"

59:30.275 --> 59:31.568
They weren't communicating.

59:31.651 --> 59:33.152
There's no phones, there's no Internet.

59:33.778 --> 59:36.739
And, like, the actual stones
that they build the pyramids with

59:36.823 --> 59:39.158
are so hard, like,
that you can't cut through those.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.702
So these people were saying

59:40.785 --> 59:43.871
that aliens were communicating
with ancient people

59:43.955 --> 59:46.249
and they were giving them
alien technology

59:46.332 --> 59:47.375
to build the pyramids.

59:47.959 --> 59:50.628
Yes! It's like, it was happening
even back then,

59:50.712 --> 59:53.089
and Satico Satellite
was giving the aliens the technology,

59:53.172 --> 59:54.924
and the aliens were giving it
to the humans.

59:55.008 --> 59:57.051
And, like, Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster.

59:57.135 --> 59:58.761
Folklore comes from somewhere,

59:58.845 --> 1:00:01.889
so at some point, someone saw a Bigfoot.

1:00:01.973 --> 1:00:03.975
Someone saw it. Exactly. They saw it.

1:00:04.058 --> 1:00:06.978
And then they knew that the aliens
were using the humans as thermometers

1:00:07.061 --> 1:00:09.230
and bringing them back up
and downloading the information

1:00:09.314 --> 1:00:10.732
to learn about our planet, you know?

1:00:10.815 --> 1:00:13.151
-Totally.
-They could even be using human clones,

1:00:13.234 --> 1:00:15.778
because that would give them
more reliable information, right?

1:00:15.862 --> 1:00:17.196
Yeah. That makes sense.

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:19.365
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

1:00:36.090 --> 1:00:36.924
Thanks.

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:39.177
Can I show you something?

1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:40.094
Yeah.

1:00:41.554 --> 1:00:43.222
Keep going straight.
I'll tell you where to go.

1:00:43.306 --> 1:00:44.182
Okay.

1:00:46.184 --> 1:00:47.435
Is this a surprise or something?

1:00:48.936 --> 1:00:50.438
-Kind of.
- Okay.

1:00:51.064 --> 1:00:54.651
I don't normally like surprises, but...
I'm excited.

1:00:54.734 --> 1:00:56.527
I think you're gonna like it.

1:00:57.820 --> 1:00:58.946
It's just further.

1:01:00.365 --> 1:01:01.366
You're a lot of fun.

1:01:02.533 --> 1:01:03.785
-You, too.

1:01:05.745 --> 1:01:07.497
Oh, okay. You're gonna take a left.

1:01:07.580 --> 1:01:08.915
-On this street.

1:01:27.266 --> 1:01:29.519
Um...

1:01:31.604 --> 1:01:33.022
-What?
-Look!

1:01:33.106 --> 1:01:34.107
What?

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:36.901
Right there, right there.
That guy.

1:01:38.820 --> 1:01:40.863
The guy having dinner with his wife?

1:01:40.947 --> 1:01:41.823
Mmm-hmm.

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:45.243
I've been seeing that guy in my dreams,

1:01:45.326 --> 1:01:47.870
and then I started to see him
in real life.

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:50.623
-What? That's crazy.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:01:50.707 --> 1:01:52.917
And, like, I didn't know my dad.

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.130
And they told me that my grandpa,
like, died in Korea or something, but...

1:01:57.922 --> 1:01:59.340
I don't even think that's true,

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:03.136
'cause, like, neither of them would have
been needed to produce me if I'm a clone.

1:02:07.598 --> 1:02:09.434
What-- Are you kidding?

1:02:10.476 --> 1:02:12.145
-No. Because--
-Oh.

1:02:12.228 --> 1:02:13.980
Like, my grandma-- Look...

1:02:14.063 --> 1:02:17.275
Okay, I think it's, like...
the clones start to, like,

1:02:17.358 --> 1:02:18.693
go crazy, or, like, expire,

1:02:18.776 --> 1:02:20.903
and then be refreshed by a newer model,
and that's me.

1:02:20.987 --> 1:02:23.990
Like, I sent my stuff to DNANU,
and they haven't responded. Nothing.

1:02:24.073 --> 1:02:26.868
Nothing at all. It's like they can't
process the information because--

1:02:26.951 --> 1:02:29.287
And, like, I've been waking up
during the abductions,

1:02:29.370 --> 1:02:31.289
so I've seen other clones,
that's how I know it's true.

1:02:31.372 --> 1:02:33.249
And, like, he says
he doesn't remember anything,

1:02:33.332 --> 1:02:34.959
but I think he's fucking lying.

1:02:38.671 --> 1:02:39.672
Okay.

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:46.012
Maybe we should go.

1:02:46.095 --> 1:02:47.513
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:02:49.098 --> 1:02:51.017
There's one more thing I wanna show you.

1:03:10.578 --> 1:03:12.121
Okay. Here. It's coming up.

1:03:13.873 --> 1:03:15.166
Okay.

1:03:16.501 --> 1:03:18.169
Okay. We're just gonna go in
right up there.

1:03:19.086 --> 1:03:21.380
-Okay. Why?
-I'll show you.

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:23.341
Sarah, don't you wanna just
go home or something?

1:03:23.424 --> 1:03:25.885
No, no, no. Just one more thing.
It's just one more thing.

1:03:27.261 --> 1:03:28.221
Okay.

1:03:31.766 --> 1:03:33.017
Here.

1:03:33.100 --> 1:03:34.602
-Here, here, here!
- Okay. Okay.

1:03:34.685 --> 1:03:35.770
Darren, pull over.

1:03:35.853 --> 1:03:37.814
- Okay. Stop. Stop.

1:03:37.897 --> 1:03:40.608
- Sarah...
-Here. Come on. Come on!

1:03:43.736 --> 1:03:46.531
Sarah. Sarah!
Sarah, what is happening?

1:03:46.614 --> 1:03:48.157
Come on, Darren.

1:03:49.283 --> 1:03:52.370
You see? It's just right here.
It's just over here!

1:03:52.453 --> 1:03:53.830
Why are we in the cemetery?

1:03:53.913 --> 1:03:55.957
It's this way.
It's this way. It's right here.

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:58.251
My mom. My mom is here.

1:03:58.334 --> 1:04:00.169
It's my mom. We'll get her.
We're gonna dig her up,

1:04:00.253 --> 1:04:01.629
because the doctor said we can't--

1:04:01.712 --> 1:04:03.631
They can't just test me.
We need her DNA and my DNA.

1:04:03.714 --> 1:04:04.549
We're gonna get her DNA.

1:04:04.632 --> 1:04:06.884
When they test them together,
they can see that I'm a clone.

1:04:06.968 --> 1:04:08.553
Can you please stop
swinging the scissors around?

1:04:08.970 --> 1:04:10.221
Yeah! We'll take the scissors,

1:04:10.304 --> 1:04:12.807
and then we'll take it to DNANU
because it's only two states away,

1:04:12.890 --> 1:04:14.684
and we can drive there tonight!
We can drive tonight.

1:04:14.767 --> 1:04:17.520
We can prove that I'm the clone
they're using to get the information!

1:04:17.603 --> 1:04:20.064
Okay, I'm sorry, Sarah, I...

1:04:20.147 --> 1:04:22.900
I didn't realize that the alien stuff was,
like, so serious, okay?

1:04:22.984 --> 1:04:25.027
What do you mean?

1:04:25.111 --> 1:04:28.406
It's like Satico Satellite,
and... and the pyramids!

1:04:28.489 --> 1:04:30.575
What the fuck is Satico Satellite?

1:04:32.410 --> 1:04:34.078
Satico Satellite.

1:04:34.662 --> 1:04:36.289
They gave the technology to the aliens

1:04:36.372 --> 1:04:38.416
and then the aliens gave the technology
to the humans,

1:04:38.499 --> 1:04:41.127
and-- and-- You said that you knew.

1:04:41.210 --> 1:04:42.920
You said that... that you knew.

1:04:43.004 --> 1:04:45.590
I mean, I... I said a lot of stuff.

1:04:45.673 --> 1:04:48.634
Okay, talking about Loch Ness Monster,
and Bigfoot, and ghosts and shit.

1:04:48.718 --> 1:04:50.636
I thought we were talking
about conspiracy theories.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.305
I didn't know it was, like, so serious.

1:04:52.388 --> 1:04:53.222
You lied to me?

1:04:53.306 --> 1:04:55.516
What? No! No, no, no.

1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:56.809
Why-- Why would you lie to me?

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:59.353
Sarah, okay, look,
I really, really, really like you.

1:04:59.437 --> 1:05:01.230
Okay? Will you please
just get back in the car?

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:04.358
Who do you work for? Who do you work for?

1:05:04.442 --> 1:05:05.818
I'm a paralegal.

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.570
Mmm, no. What is this?

1:05:07.653 --> 1:05:11.032
What are you trying to do? Why are you
trying to take advantage of me?

1:05:11.115 --> 1:05:13.618
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:05:13.701 --> 1:05:15.536
Sarah, okay. What are the--
What we gonna do?

1:05:15.620 --> 1:05:16.913
Dig up your mom with scissors?

1:05:16.996 --> 1:05:19.457
We don't even have a shovel!
This is crazy.

1:05:19.540 --> 1:05:20.750
-Please, let's get back--
-No.

1:05:20.833 --> 1:05:22.919
-Let's please get back into the--
- No! No!

1:05:23.002 --> 1:05:25.421
Don't fucking touch me!
Don't fucking touch me!

1:05:25.504 --> 1:05:27.465
No, no, no, no, no!
Just stay the fuck away from me!

1:05:27.548 --> 1:05:30.176
I'm not gonna leave you in the middle
of a cemetery at night. Will you--

1:05:30.259 --> 1:05:32.094
-Get the fuck away from me!

1:05:32.178 --> 1:05:34.722
Help! Help!

1:05:34.805 --> 1:05:36.432
Help!

1:05:37.099 --> 1:05:38.768
Get the fuck out of here!

1:05:39.936 --> 1:05:41.187
Fuck.

1:05:43.689 --> 1:05:46.317
Why? Why? Why? Why did he trick me?

1:05:51.614 --> 1:05:54.951
No, no, no!

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:57.244
Where is it?

1:05:57.995 --> 1:05:59.497
Where did--

1:06:18.015 --> 1:06:20.393
<i>He taught me</i>
<i>all I know about banishments...</i>

1:06:24.772 --> 1:06:25.856
<i>I could've done more.</i>

1:06:25.940 --> 1:06:29.276
<i>You had no way of knowing</i>
<i>Dee was in league with Scox.</i>

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:30.611
<i>He had us all fooled...</i>

1:06:33.614 --> 1:06:35.825
-No! No!

1:06:35.908 --> 1:06:37.535
It has to be on.
It has to be on.

1:06:37.618 --> 1:06:39.745
It has to be on
because of Satico Satellite.

1:06:39.829 --> 1:06:42.289
He's the god of technology,
and the aliens need to appease him.

1:06:42.373 --> 1:06:43.666
Okay, they come at night.

1:06:43.749 --> 1:06:45.710
They come at night when everything's off.
And it's not daylight.

1:06:45.793 --> 1:06:48.421
It's not daylight. It's electricity.
It's all about electricity.

1:06:48.504 --> 1:06:50.589
That's what she was talking about
on the date with Darren.

1:06:50.673 --> 1:06:53.175
Hey! Listen, we heard
about your date with Darren.

1:06:53.259 --> 1:06:55.469
Darren tricked me. Darren tricked me!

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:57.555
Darren didn't trick you.
You took him to the fucking graveyard!

1:06:57.638 --> 1:06:59.724
- Sounds like you stalked him.
-Fuck you, Brian!

1:06:59.807 --> 1:07:02.727
You don't even live here!
Why are you always here?

1:07:02.810 --> 1:07:05.688
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Sarah, I need you to calm down.

1:07:05.771 --> 1:07:06.981
Calm down. Okay? Why don't you--

1:07:07.064 --> 1:07:09.066
Why don't you, um,
start from the beginning

1:07:09.150 --> 1:07:10.234
-and explain to us--
-Listen,

1:07:10.317 --> 1:07:12.737
there is a secret conspiracy
at the heart of reality, okay?

1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:15.114
They're cloning me,
they cloned me from my grandma,

1:07:15.197 --> 1:07:16.949
they're using me
as a human thermometer, okay?

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:18.409
Now they're trying to get rid of me.

1:07:18.492 --> 1:07:20.494
They're trying to get rid of me,
but this is a safe space.

1:07:20.578 --> 1:07:23.372
It's safe here. We're protected.
And you just have to turn that on.

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:25.332
-It's off. It's not plugged in.
- Turn that on.

1:07:25.416 --> 1:07:27.710
-Brian, I need you to turn it on!
-It's not plugged in.

1:07:27.793 --> 1:07:30.629
Hey, Sarah. What you're saying
is not making any sense.

1:07:30.713 --> 1:07:32.923
Nothing makes sense. Nothing makes sense!

1:07:34.216 --> 1:07:35.634
No!

1:07:35.718 --> 1:07:38.220
-This girl-- She's fucking-- Sarah!

1:07:38.763 --> 1:07:40.306
-No, leave me alone!

1:07:40.389 --> 1:07:41.807
Sarah!

1:07:41.891 --> 1:07:43.517
-Hey! Sarah!

1:07:43.601 --> 1:07:45.019
No, no, no, no.

1:08:32.441 --> 1:08:33.275
Joan.

1:08:35.069 --> 1:08:36.112
Joan!

1:08:38.072 --> 1:08:39.615
Joan! Joan!

1:08:39.698 --> 1:08:41.659
-I'll be right back. Excuse me.
- What's happening?

1:08:41.742 --> 1:08:42.785
-Sarah.
-What's happening?

1:08:42.868 --> 1:08:45.162
Shannon, get everybody out of the store.
Tell them it's closed.

1:08:45.246 --> 1:08:48.040
-It's an emergency. Just get them out.
-Help me! Help me! Help me!

1:08:48.124 --> 1:08:50.668
-What is this? What is this?
-Don't worry.

1:08:50.751 --> 1:08:53.546
- Okay.
- Help me. Help me.

1:08:53.629 --> 1:08:55.631
- It's okay. I am helping you.

1:08:55.714 --> 1:08:58.968
You're just confused. Okay?

1:08:59.051 --> 1:09:02.888
- What is this?

1:09:03.514 --> 1:09:04.807
I don't what to do.

1:09:05.432 --> 1:09:08.894
I don't what to do. I've tried everything.
And the fabric's not working.

1:09:08.978 --> 1:09:11.313
The fabric's not working,
the lights aren't working.

1:09:11.397 --> 1:09:13.065
-I'm just really scared.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:16.235
You know you can replace a negative
thought with a positive thought.

1:09:16.318 --> 1:09:19.488
-It's never gonna stop.
-You can, just try.

1:09:19.572 --> 1:09:21.532
-Think of things you like.

1:09:21.615 --> 1:09:23.701
Like marmalade. Or flowers.

1:09:23.784 --> 1:09:26.203
You know how you like flowers?
Think of flowers.

1:09:26.287 --> 1:09:29.165
No, Joan, it's bigger than that.

1:09:29.248 --> 1:09:31.792
It's bigger than all of that.
It's bigger than thoughts,

1:09:31.876 --> 1:09:32.877
it's bigger than time.

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:35.379
It's-- It's--
It's something that Helen knew.

1:09:35.462 --> 1:09:36.881
They got her,
and they're gonna get me.

1:09:36.964 --> 1:09:38.299
They're coming after me, Joan.

1:09:38.382 --> 1:09:40.384
They're coming after me.
They're coming after me.

1:09:40.467 --> 1:09:42.678
No one's coming after you, Sarah.

1:09:42.761 --> 1:09:44.346
You're safe, I promise you.

1:09:44.430 --> 1:09:46.682
-No one would wanna take you.

1:09:46.765 --> 1:09:48.058
You're safe.

1:09:55.316 --> 1:09:57.651
<i>Shannon, just go. Punch out and go.</i>

1:09:57.735 --> 1:10:00.654
Shannon, just go. Punch out and go.

1:10:01.030 --> 1:10:02.865
<i>Sarah, put the phone down.</i>

1:10:06.577 --> 1:10:08.787
- Sarah, put the phone down.

1:10:08.871 --> 1:10:10.206
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

1:10:10.289 --> 1:10:11.749
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:10:11.832 --> 1:10:13.584
<i>-I promise you.</i>
-I promise you.

1:10:13.667 --> 1:10:16.045
<i>-I'm your friend.</i>
-I'm your friend.

1:10:18.797 --> 1:10:20.549
I can hear the future.

1:10:38.067 --> 1:10:40.194
<i>I will verbally provide you</i>
<i>with a series of questions,</i>

1:10:40.277 --> 1:10:42.529
<i>please answer to the best of your ability.</i>

1:10:43.447 --> 1:10:44.990
<i>When someone feels as upset as you do,</i>

1:10:45.074 --> 1:10:47.368
they may have thoughts
that life is not worth living.

1:10:47.451 --> 1:10:49.078
What thoughts have you had like this?

1:10:50.329 --> 1:10:51.330
None.

1:10:52.164 --> 1:10:55.501
Okay. If you decided
to end your life, how would you do so?

1:10:57.711 --> 1:10:58.796
I don't know.

1:10:59.463 --> 1:11:01.257
Have you made plans to do so?

1:11:03.550 --> 1:11:04.468
Okay.

1:11:04.551 --> 1:11:07.304
People often have mixed feelings
about harming themselves.

1:11:07.388 --> 1:11:10.474
What are some things that would stop you
from hurting yourself?

1:11:13.227 --> 1:11:14.728
My horse.

1:11:17.022 --> 1:11:18.691
My job.

1:11:19.316 --> 1:11:20.609
Occupation?

1:11:21.318 --> 1:11:24.154
I'm a salesman at the craft store.

1:11:25.197 --> 1:11:26.365
What store is this?

1:11:26.991 --> 1:11:27.908
Great Lengths.

1:11:28.867 --> 1:11:29.868
Great Lengths?

1:11:29.952 --> 1:11:31.745
-Great Lengths.
-Okay.

1:11:34.999 --> 1:11:37.501
Okay. So, this will be your room.

1:11:38.210 --> 1:11:39.962
And this one will be your bed.

1:11:45.551 --> 1:11:47.136
Try to make yourself comfortable.

1:12:16.915 --> 1:12:18.208
So, before we start,

1:12:18.292 --> 1:12:19.918
do you want some juice
or some crackers?

1:12:20.502 --> 1:12:21.337
Um, juice.

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:23.547
There you go. All right.

1:12:24.715 --> 1:12:26.967
All right. So, it's good to see you again.

1:12:27.051 --> 1:12:30.262
Um, I'm gonna be your social worker again
this week. Um...

1:12:30.929 --> 1:12:33.015
No, I've never been here before.

1:12:33.098 --> 1:12:38.145
Oh, um... I'm sorry, I'm Ethan,
I was your social worker last time.

1:12:38.228 --> 1:12:40.147
We talked a little bit about your horse

1:12:40.230 --> 1:12:42.441
and maybe some of the crafts
that you were doing.

1:12:42.524 --> 1:12:43.942
Do you remember that?

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:47.488
I don't know.

1:12:47.571 --> 1:12:49.448
Okay. All right.

1:12:49.948 --> 1:12:52.076
That's okay. I just wanna, um...

1:12:52.159 --> 1:12:55.454
How about we just talk about now
and get a sense of how you're feeling?

1:12:56.246 --> 1:12:59.249
Um, are you experiencing
any anxiety or depression?

1:13:00.334 --> 1:13:01.960
Yeah? Anxiety?

1:13:02.044 --> 1:13:04.797
Uh... Scale of one to ten,
how intense?

1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:07.299
-Ten.
-And then how about depression?

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:08.258
Mmm-mmm.

1:13:08.342 --> 1:13:10.886
-No? Well... One? Two? Three?
-One.

1:13:10.969 --> 1:13:12.679
One. Good. Okay.

1:13:12.763 --> 1:13:14.139
And are you hearing any voices,

1:13:14.223 --> 1:13:17.351
are you seeing anything that maybe
no one else is seeing?

1:13:18.477 --> 1:13:21.688
Yeah? And what is it
that you're experiencing?

1:13:23.899 --> 1:13:25.651
I'm, like, being taken.

1:13:26.318 --> 1:13:28.487
Like, being abducted by aliens.

1:13:29.530 --> 1:13:32.616
And, like, I think
that they're cloning me.

1:13:32.699 --> 1:13:34.576
And I've seen, like...

1:13:35.661 --> 1:13:38.455
Like, people always say that
I look just like my grandma,

1:13:38.539 --> 1:13:41.250
and, like, I've seen photos of her,
we look exactly alike.

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:42.793
Like, I look like her clone.

1:13:42.876 --> 1:13:45.671
And-- And I think... I think that I am.

1:13:45.754 --> 1:13:47.881
Like, I think I'm a clone of her.

1:13:48.799 --> 1:13:49.842
Okay.

1:13:50.759 --> 1:13:54.513
Um, can you tell me a little bit more
about your family?

1:13:56.723 --> 1:13:58.851
Yeah. Um...

1:14:01.145 --> 1:14:04.773
You know, people always said
that my grandma was so crazy.

1:14:04.857 --> 1:14:06.733
Like, she was, like,

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:09.820
talking to the walls, and, like,

1:14:09.903 --> 1:14:12.656
she was hearing voices,
she thought she was from the future.

1:14:12.739 --> 1:14:14.700
- Yeah.
-And she was super paranoid,

1:14:14.783 --> 1:14:16.368
and-- and, like...

1:14:16.952 --> 1:14:20.330
Now I think that maybe
she wasn't crazy at all.

1:14:20.956 --> 1:14:22.249
Because I'm feeling it.

1:14:22.332 --> 1:14:24.418
Like, the same thing is happening to me.

1:14:24.501 --> 1:14:27.087
And she was in a place like this.
She got put in a place like this.

1:14:27.171 --> 1:14:29.339
And then, you know,
Reagan closed down all the hospitals,

1:14:29.423 --> 1:14:31.592
and she got put out on the street,
and she died as, like,

1:14:31.675 --> 1:14:33.969
a homeless woman... in the streets.

1:14:36.346 --> 1:14:37.431
I'm sorry.

1:14:40.350 --> 1:14:43.979
Um, what about your mom?
Did she have similar issues?

1:14:44.062 --> 1:14:46.315
No. My mom had depression.

1:14:50.903 --> 1:14:51.945
My mom...

1:14:59.077 --> 1:15:00.370
She...

1:15:07.461 --> 1:15:10.214
Mom was just, like, really depressed,
and she killed herself...

1:15:10.297 --> 1:15:12.007
...last year.

1:15:15.802 --> 1:15:17.471
<i>I found her in her bathroom.</i>

1:15:18.055 --> 1:15:21.141
<i>She was just really depressed. She, um...</i>

1:15:22.059 --> 1:15:23.644
<i>She took a lot of pills.</i>

1:15:34.321 --> 1:15:36.615
I'm really sorry. Um...

1:15:36.698 --> 1:15:38.575
How about your dad? Is he around?

1:15:39.159 --> 1:15:40.577
No.

1:15:41.870 --> 1:15:44.039
No. I didn't have a dad. He was...

1:15:44.623 --> 1:15:45.916
I mean, Gary raised me.

1:15:45.999 --> 1:15:47.751
I thought Gary was my dad, but...

1:15:48.877 --> 1:15:51.380
he left when I was, like, 16.

1:15:52.548 --> 1:15:53.715
And who's Gary?

1:15:53.799 --> 1:15:56.218
Mmm. He was my mom's husband.

1:15:56.301 --> 1:15:58.512
-He's her ex-husband.
- Okay.

1:16:00.764 --> 1:16:03.559
You've been through a lot.

1:16:05.060 --> 1:16:07.062
I want you to know that, um...

1:16:07.145 --> 1:16:10.607
I-- I believe that
you're telling me your truth

1:16:10.691 --> 1:16:14.736
and that what you're experiencing
feels 100% real to you,

1:16:14.820 --> 1:16:17.823
um, and I appreciate your honesty,
I really do.

1:16:17.906 --> 1:16:20.450
I can feel that from you,
and that's gonna go a long way

1:16:20.534 --> 1:16:22.035
in terms of, um, where we wanna go.

1:16:22.661 --> 1:16:26.123
But I also wanna just say,
for the sake of our rapport...

1:16:26.206 --> 1:16:28.625
...uh, that I...

1:16:28.709 --> 1:16:32.212
I am a bit skeptical
of alien abductions and cloning,

1:16:32.296 --> 1:16:34.006
-um, but I--
- Me, too.

1:16:34.089 --> 1:16:36.925
I know that it sounds crazy. Okay?

1:16:37.009 --> 1:16:40.262
I know it sounds really crazy,
but it just feels really real

1:16:40.345 --> 1:16:41.930
-to me, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:42.472 --> 1:16:43.765
And I just...

1:16:45.058 --> 1:16:47.811
I just wish that I could... start over.

1:16:47.894 --> 1:16:50.606
We don't-- We don't need
to go back or start over.

1:16:50.689 --> 1:16:53.567
We can start from right here,
and, um...

1:16:53.650 --> 1:16:56.486
You know, we've had great success here,
and we have an incredible team.

1:16:56.570 --> 1:17:00.949
And we-- I and they are
100% committed to helping you.

1:17:20.344 --> 1:17:21.887
Where's Ethan?

1:17:23.430 --> 1:17:25.766
He said he'd watch me sleep.

1:17:25.849 --> 1:17:27.809
Ethan already left
for the night.

1:17:27.893 --> 1:17:30.520
Don't worry, Sarah, we have a full staff,
you'll be safe.

1:17:32.272 --> 1:17:34.149
Try and get some rest,
it'll be good for you.

1:17:35.567 --> 1:17:37.402
Okay, Sarah, have a good night.

1:18:18.402 --> 1:18:20.237
Where have you been? Are you okay?

1:18:21.988 --> 1:18:24.741
Hello? Just talk to me,
just tell me where you went.

1:18:24.825 --> 1:18:27.160
- Who are you?
-What do you mean, who am I?

1:18:28.870 --> 1:18:31.540
-Why are you wearing Nikki's clothes?
-These are my clothes.

1:18:31.623 --> 1:18:33.583
Okay, just tell me how you got out.

1:18:34.292 --> 1:18:36.294
-What happened?
-Where are my fabrics?

1:18:36.378 --> 1:18:37.546
What do you mean, "fabrics"?

1:18:37.629 --> 1:18:39.005
Why are you...

1:18:43.927 --> 1:18:44.970
You're not Nikki.

1:18:45.053 --> 1:18:46.763
- What?
-No, you're wearing her clothes.

1:18:46.847 --> 1:18:48.598
-Why are you acting like this?
-Get away from me.

1:18:48.682 --> 1:18:50.350
-Get away from me.
-What do you mean, "Get away"?

1:18:50.434 --> 1:18:51.810
-You're not Nikki. No!
-I'm trying to help you!

1:18:51.893 --> 1:18:53.395
-Tell me where you went!
-No!

1:18:53.478 --> 1:18:54.813
-Open up!
-No!

1:18:56.231 --> 1:18:57.232
Let me help you!

1:18:59.901 --> 1:19:01.653
Open this fucking door!

1:19:03.363 --> 1:19:05.949
-Open this door!

1:19:06.032 --> 1:19:07.409
-Open it!

1:20:35.455 --> 1:20:36.289
Hey.

1:20:38.583 --> 1:20:40.627
What are you doing here?

1:20:45.048 --> 1:20:46.550
I have to keep her safe.

1:21:04.693 --> 1:21:07.571
Get out of here.

1:21:12.617 --> 1:21:13.660
Get out of here!

1:21:15.579 --> 1:21:16.997
Get out of here!

1:21:17.539 --> 1:21:18.540
Hyah!

1:21:57.162 --> 1:21:58.830
Wake up, Ron.

1:22:00.123 --> 1:22:01.082
Wake up.

1:22:45.502 --> 1:22:47.587
I've never seen him
like that before.

1:22:47.671 --> 1:22:48.546
Yeah.

1:22:49.130 --> 1:22:51.466
- He was so angry.
- Yeah.

1:22:52.092 --> 1:22:53.635
It was so scary.

1:22:55.095 --> 1:22:57.138
You have nothing to be afraid of.

1:22:58.014 --> 1:22:59.808
-Okay.
-I'm here for you.

1:23:00.392 --> 1:23:01.267
Yeah.

1:23:02.519 --> 1:23:03.603
I love you.

1:28:03.486 --> 1:28:04.696
Hi.

1:28:06.823 --> 1:28:07.865
Hi.

1:28:50.700 --> 1:28:52.160
Were you just in my bed?

1:28:56.831 --> 1:28:58.624
Why are you in my fucking bed?

1:29:09.052 --> 1:29:10.053
It's you.

1:29:17.393 --> 1:29:19.103
Why are you here?

1:29:20.855 --> 1:29:23.191
I really don't wanna
talk about that with you.

1:29:24.359 --> 1:29:25.443
Please.

1:29:26.402 --> 1:29:28.154
Sorry. I really...

1:29:28.988 --> 1:29:30.490
just wanna go back to sleep.

1:29:30.573 --> 1:29:32.492
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on.

1:29:32.575 --> 1:29:34.869
I know. I-- I understand.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

1:29:34.952 --> 1:29:36.621
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.

1:29:36.704 --> 1:29:37.789
I know you.

1:29:38.414 --> 1:29:40.958
I know you from somewhere
that's not... here.

1:29:44.796 --> 1:29:46.422
Do you remember me?

1:29:49.801 --> 1:29:51.552
I would like to go back to sleep.

1:29:51.636 --> 1:29:53.638
Please. Please, tell me. Just...

1:29:54.972 --> 1:29:55.973
tell me.

1:29:56.933 --> 1:30:00.061
What happened is that
I went to sleep in fucking 1995,

1:30:00.144 --> 1:30:02.146
and I woke up
and all the buildings are different.

1:30:02.230 --> 1:30:05.233
I can't find anyone I know.
I can't find where I'm supposed to be.

1:30:05.316 --> 1:30:06.150
Nothing makes sense.

1:30:06.234 --> 1:30:08.486
And every time I tell anybody that,
they look at me like I'm fucking crazy,

1:30:08.569 --> 1:30:09.821
'cause that's a crazy thing to say.

1:30:09.904 --> 1:30:11.489
And now you think I'm crazy.

1:30:11.572 --> 1:30:13.950
-And we're both fucking here!
-You're not crazy.

1:30:14.033 --> 1:30:15.118
You're not crazy.

1:30:15.201 --> 1:30:17.286
My grandmother thought
she was from the future

1:30:17.370 --> 1:30:18.579
and nobody believed her.

1:30:18.663 --> 1:30:21.624
-They can take us to other times.
-Who can?

1:30:22.792 --> 1:30:23.793
We're being abducted.

1:30:23.876 --> 1:30:25.503
Oh, my God.

1:30:25.586 --> 1:30:28.256
At the same time. No, no, no, no.
Please listen to me.

1:30:28.339 --> 1:30:29.298
There's a white space.

1:30:29.382 --> 1:30:32.427
There's-- There's-- There's a ramp
floating over the ocean.

1:30:32.510 --> 1:30:34.929
There's-- There's--
There's the, like, fingers.

1:30:35.012 --> 1:30:36.472
How do you know about the ramp?

1:30:37.932 --> 1:30:39.142
You've seen it.

1:30:40.309 --> 1:30:41.811
Yeah, that's the dream I have
all the time.

1:30:41.894 --> 1:30:43.229
How do you know about that?

1:30:43.938 --> 1:30:45.356
It's not a dream.

1:30:50.987 --> 1:30:53.030
How do you know
about that dream?

1:30:54.615 --> 1:30:56.617
How do you know about that?
I've never told you that.

1:30:59.328 --> 1:31:00.705
I believe you.

1:31:03.082 --> 1:31:04.917
Well, good morning.

1:31:05.001 --> 1:31:07.044
-Morning.
-How are you feeling?

1:31:08.004 --> 1:31:09.338
-Good.

1:31:09.422 --> 1:31:10.506
-Yeah.
-Good.

1:31:10.590 --> 1:31:13.134
I'm feeling much better
having gotten some sleep.

1:31:13.593 --> 1:31:16.304
And... I know I'm not a clone.

1:31:16.387 --> 1:31:17.638
And I think I...

1:31:18.473 --> 1:31:19.974
figured a lot of stuff out.

1:31:21.350 --> 1:31:22.268
Um...

1:31:23.269 --> 1:31:24.103
Okay.

1:31:24.604 --> 1:31:26.606
Uh, sounds like
you're making good progress.

1:31:27.231 --> 1:31:30.067
Um... Well, um, I have some good news.

1:31:30.151 --> 1:31:32.528
Um... You've been here almost 72 hours

1:31:32.612 --> 1:31:35.615
and, um, Dr. Fung has decided
to discharge you today.

1:31:35.698 --> 1:31:38.493
-So you're gonna be going--
-I've only been here one night.

1:31:39.744 --> 1:31:43.372
Um, well... It's been almost three days.

1:31:43.456 --> 1:31:45.875
Um... But it's, uh...

1:31:46.459 --> 1:31:48.586
Look, a lot of times when people
come in for the first time,

1:31:48.669 --> 1:31:50.254
their brains are adjusting for a while,

1:31:50.338 --> 1:31:53.674
and it's not abnormal that you
wouldn't remember everything, so...

1:31:56.052 --> 1:31:57.428
That actually makes a lot of sense.

1:31:57.512 --> 1:31:59.388
It's like how you told me yesterday
that I had...

1:31:59.472 --> 1:32:01.891
met you before, a few weeks ago.

1:32:02.725 --> 1:32:04.769
I'm sorry, I didn't-- I said--

1:32:04.852 --> 1:32:07.104
It totally works.
Remember how I was telling you that

1:32:07.188 --> 1:32:10.149
there was a guy I was seeing
in my dream and, like, in the abductions,

1:32:10.233 --> 1:32:11.567
but there was a girl there, too.

1:32:11.651 --> 1:32:13.027
And that girl was my roommate here,

1:32:13.110 --> 1:32:14.779
and she remembers the abductions, too,

1:32:14.862 --> 1:32:17.990
because we were both waking up,
but Ron, the guy, wasn't,

1:32:18.074 --> 1:32:19.867
so he doesn't remember anything.

1:32:19.951 --> 1:32:22.703
And they brought her here
from another time. So, like...

1:32:22.787 --> 1:32:25.915
it all makes sense, it's--
it's like a loop, it's continual.

1:32:25.998 --> 1:32:28.584
It-- It-- It has to happen.

1:32:28.668 --> 1:32:30.002
I'm not a clone.

1:32:31.045 --> 1:32:33.339
I am my grandmother.

1:32:34.549 --> 1:32:36.592
It's actually kinda beautiful.

1:32:38.678 --> 1:32:39.762
Okay.

1:32:40.346 --> 1:32:43.307
Um... Who's the girl that you talked to?

1:32:44.308 --> 1:32:46.519
Do you think I imagined the girl
in my room?

1:32:46.602 --> 1:32:49.772
No. I-- I actually don't know anything
about the room assignments, I just--

1:32:49.855 --> 1:32:51.607
You know, I-- I'm here...

1:32:52.275 --> 1:32:53.651
and, uh, I just would've hoped

1:32:53.734 --> 1:32:56.904
that you would refrain from taking advice
from other patients.

1:32:56.988 --> 1:32:59.365
Well, it's not advice,
it's just the truth.

1:33:01.742 --> 1:33:02.827
Okay.

1:33:03.494 --> 1:33:05.454
Um... Well,

1:33:06.038 --> 1:33:08.749
this will all be in your paperwork,
but I wanna highlight,

1:33:08.833 --> 1:33:11.043
I-- I made an appointment for you, um,

1:33:11.127 --> 1:33:13.671
over at the Fox Haven Clinic,
it's on Green Street,

1:33:13.754 --> 1:33:15.548
and, um, it's-- it's free,

1:33:15.631 --> 1:33:18.593
and it's your choice
whether you wanna go or not, but, um...

1:33:20.011 --> 1:33:22.471
Uh, I-- I really...

1:33:23.055 --> 1:33:24.307
hope that you go.

1:33:24.974 --> 1:33:27.310
Because I have high hopes for you.

1:33:27.393 --> 1:33:29.729
And, uh, I'm-- I'm rooting for you,

1:33:29.812 --> 1:33:31.606
and I think it'd be very important

1:33:32.231 --> 1:33:33.566
for you to follow up with that.

1:33:34.233 --> 1:33:35.651
Thanks, Ethan.

1:33:36.777 --> 1:33:38.112
I know what I need to do.

1:33:38.863 --> 1:33:40.031
Well...

1:33:41.490 --> 1:33:43.451
what is-- what is your plan?

1:34:29.246 --> 1:34:31.290
<i> I'm not gonna pay</i>
<i>to have them fixed,</i>

1:34:31.374 --> 1:34:33.918
but I wanna be able to...
bite off asparagus.

1:34:34.001 --> 1:34:36.921
I can't bite asparagus 'cause it just goes
right through my teeth.

1:34:37.505 --> 1:34:39.423
Well, I thought you had those, uh...

1:34:40.299 --> 1:34:43.469
those plates put on your teeth, those--
What do you call them? Ooh, come on.

1:34:43.552 --> 1:34:45.763
- No, the-- My mouthguard?
- Yeah.

1:34:45.846 --> 1:34:48.182
- I don't wear that.
- That's just for snoring, or...

1:34:56.774 --> 1:34:58.776
Hey, my girl.

1:34:59.443 --> 1:35:00.611
Hi.

1:35:01.570 --> 1:35:02.780
I came back for you.

1:35:06.867 --> 1:35:08.369
My sweet girl.

1:35:08.452 --> 1:35:09.704
Look what I brought you.

1:35:19.171 --> 1:35:20.172
Hey.

1:35:21.215 --> 1:35:22.550
Let's go.

1:36:55.017 --> 1:36:55.976
Whoa.

1:37:00.022 --> 1:37:01.857
I'll always protect you.

1:37:03.776 --> 1:37:04.985
I love you.
