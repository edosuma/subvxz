00:46.542 --> 00:49.050
Slow down. Park there.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.100
Mr. Yampolsky, you have
followed all the rules.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.592
You'll pass your test tomorrow, I'm sure.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.416
And after you get your license,

00:58.417 --> 01:01.999
I suspect you'll buy the
biggest, fastest car.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.400
And throw all the rules out of the window.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.332
It is not a joke.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.957
Remember driving is a freedom.

01:07.958 --> 01:11.124
I wish you to enjoy every
kind of freedom...

01:11.125 --> 01:13.342
As long as you don't hurt someone.

01:13.958 --> 01:15.758
You promise me?

01:15.958 --> 01:18.291
- Okay, Mr. Singh.
- Mr. Singh Tur.

01:18.292 --> 01:20.758
- Mr. Singh Tur.
- Thank you.

01:21.208 --> 01:23.957
<i>The objective here is
to be at a minimum</i>

01:23.958 --> 01:26.957
<i>six cars at least from the
nearest vehicle in front.</i>

01:26.958 --> 01:29.582
<i>You can't help it they charge
you once in a while,</i>

01:29.583 --> 01:32.999
<i>like this little hot dog wants
to go by, in a sports car.</i>

01:33.000 --> 01:37.124
<i>But by in large most people run
along in about the same speed.</i>

01:37.125 --> 01:39.717
<i>I like to drive in the speed of traffic.</i>

02:18.542 --> 02:19.842
Taxi!

02:21.125 --> 02:22.707
Ted!

02:22.708 --> 02:24.124
Ted!

02:24.125 --> 02:27.541
- You can't run out on me!
- Hudson and Jane. Quick! Quick!

02:27.542 --> 02:28.957
Hold on! Hold on, please.

02:28.958 --> 02:30.124
Go! Go!

02:30.125 --> 02:31.633
- Shit!
- Crazy.

02:34.417 --> 02:36.008
You're just a bastard!

02:37.583 --> 02:42.166
To inform me in a public place
so I can't make a scene!

02:42.167 --> 02:43.416
And you thought that would work?

02:43.417 --> 02:44.967
- Hey, cut that out.
- You thought that would work?

02:45.042 --> 02:48.242
- Excuse me, you said Hudson & Jane?
- Yeah, Hudson & Jane.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.250
Is that where she lives?

02:51.750 --> 02:53.666
Oh, you cock-sucker!

02:53.667 --> 02:55.166
Oh, cock-sucker!

02:55.167 --> 02:57.124
- I'm not going home with you, Wendy.
- What?

02:57.125 --> 02:58.749
- After 21 years?
- Yes.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.999
- How long have you been lying to me?
- I didn't lie!

03:02.000 --> 03:06.457
- I did not fucking lie!
- ...anything was wrong?

03:06.458 --> 03:09.207
Now you blind... you blind-side me.

03:09.208 --> 03:13.041
Oh blind-side you? When did you
ever notice anything, Wendy?

03:13.042 --> 03:15.520
On the rare occasion when you
look up from your book...

03:15.521 --> 03:17.666
Or your fucking computer.

03:17.667 --> 03:21.124
You look right through me like I'm a ghost.

03:21.125 --> 03:24.332
Well, I'm looking through
you now and you're a prick.

03:24.333 --> 03:25.633
A prick.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.082
What is she?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.249
Is she one of your students?

03:30.250 --> 03:31.541
Oh...

03:31.542 --> 03:33.300
That's as good as a yes.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.041
Goddamn you!

03:36.042 --> 03:37.749
- Alright, pull over, let me out of here.
- No, no.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.166
- I'm done!
- No, please! Just...

03:39.167 --> 03:40.749
Just come home and we'll talk...

03:40.750 --> 03:44.000
No, I'm done, I'm done. It's not
gonna do any good. Stop it!

03:44.042 --> 03:46.249
Take it to 112... Shut up!

03:46.250 --> 03:47.999
Shut the fuck up!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.957
- Take her to 112 West 98th Street.
- Yes, sir.

03:50.958 --> 03:52.416
You just don't understand.

03:52.417 --> 03:53.883
Right here.

03:54.958 --> 03:56.967
Go, go.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.050
I don't understand.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.258
I don't understand.

04:07.417 --> 04:09.675
I don't understand...

04:36.375 --> 04:37.967
We are here.

04:38.875 --> 04:40.925
Number 112.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.175
No, please. He paid me already.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.133
- Thank you.
- Yes.

06:58.708 --> 07:00.050
Good morning.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.842
Good morning.

07:17.375 --> 07:18.925
Preet.

07:21.292 --> 07:22.758
Preet.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.041
Hey, Uncle D.

07:26.042 --> 07:30.041
I got another job, big renovation
this time. At least four weeks.

07:30.042 --> 07:31.374
Where did you get that?

07:31.375 --> 07:33.874
This one? I've paid for it...?

07:33.875 --> 07:35.749
Preet, you must save your money.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.957
Uncle D, I must have my music.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.008
Turn that around, if you can't wear
it properly, put on the dastan.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.825
Uncle D, I think it's a
little past your bedtime.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.842
Tasha?

08:14.125 --> 08:15.925
- Hey!
- Hi, Mom.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.342
They don't use any chemical
sprays or fertilizers.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.842
I just love being out on the tractor.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.874
- Tractor?
- A big red tractor.

08:35.875 --> 08:38.842
I love the air and smells and...

08:39.082 --> 08:40.924
And the dirt.

08:42.207 --> 08:45.999
Growing up in the city, I always
thought of dirt as grime, you know?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.133
But this is like alive,

08:48.208 --> 08:50.842
It's nourishing, it's rich. I just wanna...

08:51.208 --> 08:52.633
I want to eat it.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.379
I want to skip my first semester...

08:57.380 --> 08:59.633
so I can save for the harvest.

09:00.167 --> 09:01.842
Did you ask your father?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.050
He said to ask you.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.258
No one stands to reason.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.633
I'm the one paying your tuition.

09:09.542 --> 09:11.499
- True.
- You know, do what you want.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.925
Vermont suits you. You look dangerously...

09:15.000 --> 09:16.499
Dangerously healthy.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.582
Why don't you come stay with me?
They can put you up on the farm...

09:19.583 --> 09:21.008
You can write there.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.707
The train is on the other
side of the state.

09:23.708 --> 09:27.291
- So?
- And I, of course, can't drive.

09:27.292 --> 09:29.124
- Why not?
- Why can't you drive?

09:29.125 --> 09:31.332
- I don't understand.
- Let's not start that again.

09:31.333 --> 09:32.499
It is so easy. I did it.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.749
Let's not get into that right now.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.249
And even if I could, it's too far and...

09:37.250 --> 09:40.207
It's out in the middle of nowhere,
There's no internet.

09:40.208 --> 09:44.508
But, don't you want to get away?
There's so many memories in this house...

09:45.042 --> 09:46.207
Tasha...

09:46.208 --> 09:48.332
When I think of you and dad not together,

09:48.333 --> 09:50.092
it makes me so upset.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.374
I'm fine.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.467
And you're here all alone...

09:55.000 --> 09:56.300
In this house.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.467
Please don't be upset.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.457
I thought you'd be upset.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.300
We've weathered this before.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.624
Every seven years, it comes over him.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.124
He gets restless and
does something juvenile.

10:07.125 --> 10:10.175
So at 21 years, we're on our third itch.

10:12.208 --> 10:14.508
Or it's male menopause.

10:14.583 --> 10:18.233
Instead of buying motorcycle, Daddy
decided to give adultery a spin.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.467
Tell you what,

10:23.292 --> 10:25.050
when he comes home,

10:27.292 --> 10:29.467
We'll drive up to visit.

10:34.292 --> 10:36.300
You'll drive up to visit.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.925
Dad is not coming home.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.707
Go look upstairs, he didn't
take any of his books.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.342
What does that tell you? Go look.

10:54.417 --> 10:57.883
He said he filed for separation yesterday.

11:02.042 --> 11:05.425
And he uses you to deliver that message?

11:06.167 --> 11:09.874
I hope she knows she'll
have to pay for his keep...

11:09.875 --> 11:11.749
Because he is a loser.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.291
In 20 years he couldn't get tenure.

11:14.292 --> 11:16.416
How anyone besides me,

11:16.417 --> 11:19.699
could consider him romantic material is...

11:19.700 --> 11:21.416
It's stupefying.

11:21.417 --> 11:22.874
So you are upset.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.842
No, I'm not.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.550
I'm disgusted.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.008
You're gonna stay for dinner?

11:40.542 --> 11:42.717
- Well, I...
- Yeah?

11:43.625 --> 11:45.300
I...

11:45.792 --> 11:47.508
I actually,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.633
I told Dad that I would eat with him.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.791
So this is just a visit?

11:57.792 --> 12:00.374
- Stopping by to see if Mom is a basket case?
- No.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.624
And then run that message back to him.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.707
Thanks. You can go now.

12:04.708 --> 12:07.499
- Mom... that's...
- No, no... I mean it...

12:07.500 --> 12:09.791
I have work to do.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.592
I just got here.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.717
Please don't walk away.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.342
Please.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.800
What?

13:14.583 --> 13:16.633
You left this in my cab.

13:19.583 --> 13:20.883
Okay.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.633
Oh, just a minute, just...

13:25.875 --> 13:27.041
I think...

13:27.042 --> 13:28.332
Oh!

13:28.333 --> 13:31.425
It's pathetic. Let me get
you some real money.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.700
I don't want anything, I like to help.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.967
You like to help?

13:37.458 --> 13:40.175
That is impossible. You
can't be from New York.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.342
Yes, I am. From Queens.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.582
That's not really New York, but...

13:45.583 --> 13:49.092
You're very kind and I thank you.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.758
Are you sure I can't give you something?

14:06.542 --> 14:09.175
Do you have a card?

15:14.208 --> 15:17.858
<i>Hi, this is Tasha. Please leave me
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

15:18.042 --> 15:21.874
Tash, it's me. I'm sorry about what I said.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.541
And you're right, I need
a change of scenery.

15:24.542 --> 15:25.791
So guess what?

15:25.792 --> 15:29.092
I'm gonna get my license, buy a new car...

15:29.417 --> 15:31.374
And drive up and see you.

15:31.375 --> 15:34.467
So we can eat some dirt together.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.258
Love you.

15:39.800 --> 15:40.957
<i>Alright, we all ready?</i>

15:40.958 --> 15:42.508
<i>15 seconds.</i>

15:43.625 --> 15:46.633
I heard about you and Ted.
I'm really sorry.

15:47.375 --> 15:49.633
Heard what exactly?

15:50.458 --> 15:52.416
- That you and he...
- No, no, no.

15:52.417 --> 15:55.899
We're just taking a
breather, for God's sake.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.999
And joining me today's topic
are critics necessary...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.124
are three of out most influential critics:

16:01.125 --> 16:02.999
- Film reviewer J. Howard Mintz.
- Hello.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.166
Paige Belknap, who covers art...

16:05.167 --> 16:07.249
And, of course, book critic Wendy Shields.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.624
Let's start with you, Wendy.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.874
- It's good to have you back.
- Always a pleasure.

16:10.875 --> 16:14.707
Wendy, no child dreams of
being a literary critic.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.383
What drew you to it?

16:16.458 --> 16:18.258
No child?

16:19.958 --> 16:23.166
I... I wanted anything to do with words.

16:23.167 --> 16:26.499
I... I grew up in a household
that was far from peaceful...

16:26.500 --> 16:30.092
And books just floated me away...

16:30.167 --> 16:34.258
I... It's part of my job
to review bad books too..

16:34.542 --> 16:39.092
But the good ones still carry me off.

16:39.167 --> 16:41.967
What are the current authors
you enjoy reviewing?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.092
Many. But...

16:46.042 --> 16:47.758
Martin Amis,

16:47.792 --> 16:49.633
Toni Morrison,

16:50.500 --> 16:51.800
Delia Krauss.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.791
I especially loved her short stories.

16:56.792 --> 17:00.249
You know, the magazine has
published most of them.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.925
What? Nobody likes Delia Krauss?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.675
Well, I do.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.082
Delia Krauss. Whore.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.883
- We thought you knew.
- No.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.133
I thought it was one of Ted's students.
Now I get it.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.624
She was right in the Residence last year.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.842
She ploughed through half of faculty.

17:20.875 --> 17:24.008
We said she would fuck gravel. Fuck.

17:25.291 --> 17:26.540
Maybe won't last.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.342
- He'll be back.
- Oh, God...

17:30.125 --> 17:32.592
Every time I open up the magazine...

17:35.125 --> 17:37.425
I'm gonna have to see your name.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.250
Are you headed to the office?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.675
- Let's head back to the office.
- No, no, I...

17:48.292 --> 17:50.383
I think I'm gonna...

17:52.750 --> 17:55.967
I'm gonna work from home
for a while, I think.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.957
Who is it?

18:02.958 --> 18:06.008
Darwan Singh Tur, for your
driving lessons please.

18:06.125 --> 18:07.633
Oh, God!

18:11.292 --> 18:13.133
I completely forgot.

18:13.333 --> 18:16.416
Anyway, I've changed
my mind about lessons.

18:16.417 --> 18:18.133
Why, if I may ask?

18:21.583 --> 18:24.832
I am really sorry. I
will pay you for today.

18:24.833 --> 18:28.050
Don't pay me, but I will ask
a small favour from you.

18:29.958 --> 18:30.956
Of course.

18:30.957 --> 18:33.791
Come, sit in the car, the driver's seat.
So you'll get used to it.

18:33.792 --> 18:37.300
- I'm in the middle of work.
- Let me do my job just a little.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.082
Okay.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.175
Seat belt first.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.967
First position, turns on the
electrical systems. Second position...

19:00.167 --> 19:04.133
Next you have three mirrors:
rear view, left and right.

19:04.375 --> 19:08.332
I really don't need to learn this.
My husband drives, so...

19:08.333 --> 19:10.749
I never learned to cook
because, I thought my mother...

19:10.750 --> 19:12.799
Would always be there to cook for me.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.249
Then there was half a world between us.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.508
And so I made my own food.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.092
Your point?

19:20.208 --> 19:21.374
No point.

19:21.375 --> 19:24.550
Turn your head, so you
can see the blind spot.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.374
And left shoulder.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.967
Turn your head.

19:28.125 --> 19:28.799
Left shoulder,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.883
So you can see the blind spot.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.300
Now put on your left signal.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.550
Shit.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.133
Other side of the wheel.

19:39.292 --> 19:41.383
Put on your left signal.

19:41.958 --> 19:45.050
Now turn your wheel all
the way to the left.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.883
Put on the brake.

19:49.958 --> 19:51.842
Now you are in drive.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.550
Now the gas pedal.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.383
What happened?

20:01.625 --> 20:03.633
- We're moving.
- That's good.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.582
I think I don't like this.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.791
Well, you have to go forward now, because
I haven't taught you how to back up.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.633
Now check your mirrors
again, turn your head.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.092
Oh, Jesus!

20:13.833 --> 20:17.874
Nothing will happen. I'm always
here with the other brake.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.633
Now, press your foot.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.967
Press the pedal gradually.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.883
Down and release.

20:28.667 --> 20:31.592
Press the pedal gradually.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.800
Straighten your wheel.

20:46.583 --> 20:49.508
Hey! Ma-ji sent another photo.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.624
Ah! She looks sour.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.249
- She would complain a lot.
- What? You didn't even look.

20:54.250 --> 20:57.633
You know, every single time you
find a reason to not like her.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.359
I don't know how many more
years it's gonna be...

20:59.360 --> 21:01.946
Until they're all gone
and you're left alone.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.499
You think in your head
you're still in prison.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.633
Be quiet! And you'll never
speak to me like that again!

21:08.083 --> 21:09.689
You were a skinny scared
boy when I took you in.

21:09.690 --> 21:11.374
I promised your Mum to help you.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.800
Now you can be cheek and disrespect.

21:16.167 --> 21:19.457
And you was stinky too, smeared
all over with garlic paste?

21:19.458 --> 21:22.541
Well, they said it would keep the
rattle snakes away, in the desert.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.541
So one of the border guards
didn't smell you coming.

21:25.542 --> 21:27.592
- Hey! It worked, right?
- What!

21:33.167 --> 21:35.416
Teach us how to see everything.

21:35.417 --> 21:38.092
Your eyes, it goes from
sidewalk to sidewalk...

21:38.958 --> 21:40.999
And one block ahead.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.374
You see the markings on the roads,
The lights...

21:44.375 --> 21:45.832
Read the signs.

21:45.833 --> 21:49.300
- There's too many to read.
- It comes with time.

21:49.958 --> 21:52.967
Beware of living as well
as non-living things...

21:53.667 --> 21:57.425
When you see a person ahead of you,
Try to guess what they'll do next.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.967
Smoothly adjust.

22:03.042 --> 22:05.207
The driver's biggest
problem is everyone else.

22:05.208 --> 22:08.541
You can't always trust
people to behave properly.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.050
Ain't that the truth.

22:12.167 --> 22:13.592
It's a red light.

22:15.208 --> 22:19.508
I mean isn't it strange that red has
come to mean "stop" and "danger"?

22:19.625 --> 22:21.707
It strikes to me that
stopping is when you're safe.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.582
- And going is dangerous.
- Don't talk, Wendy.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.333
When you talk, you don't see.

22:26.833 --> 22:28.633
Watch the light.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.383
Ted!

22:46.417 --> 22:48.383
Don't you love me any-more?

22:48.625 --> 22:50.258
No.

22:50.292 --> 22:52.258
But why?

22:53.500 --> 22:55.999
How did I fail you?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.050
What should I have done?

23:00.333 --> 23:02.092
- Pay attention.
- Oh God!

23:03.042 --> 23:04.374
Oh my God!

23:04.375 --> 23:05.825
Why didn't you see her?

23:07.333 --> 23:08.883
Were you wandering?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.999
I'm never gonna be good at this.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.957
- Never.
- Every time it will get easier.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.383
Now drive on.

23:19.167 --> 23:21.416
Can you please drive me home?

23:21.417 --> 23:23.541
No, you will do it.

23:23.542 --> 23:25.342
I will help.

23:27.458 --> 23:30.092
Take the wheel, press the pedal.

23:35.042 --> 23:36.425
<i>She's not young...</i>

23:37.000 --> 23:39.450
<i>But she can still have one or two children.</i>

23:40.208 --> 23:42.166
So why hasn't she been married?

23:42.167 --> 23:45.957
<i>She was engaged once,
but the police shot her fiance</i>

23:45.958 --> 23:47.967
<i>just like they did to our Sameer.</i>

23:48.458 --> 23:51.874
<i>Then her father was ill for a long time
and needed her at home.</i>

23:51.875 --> 23:54.332
<i>Now he is dead, she has nowhere to go.</i>

23:54.333 --> 23:55.666
She is perfect.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.874
<i>She is the best one for you, Darwan.</i>

23:57.875 --> 23:59.889
<i>And very nice looking.</i>

23:59.890 --> 24:01.300
<i>Did you see the photo?</i>

24:01.458 --> 24:05.791
Yes, but can I talk to her
and see her like we're doing?

24:05.792 --> 24:07.499
<i>She won't come to the phone.</i>

24:07.500 --> 24:09.999
<i>She thinks you'll see she's too old.</i>

24:10.000 --> 24:13.249
<i>She says, 'He won't like me.'</i>

24:13.250 --> 24:14.707
No, he won't, Ma-ji.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.008
I'll think about it.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.999
Rasbir, please take the
phone to the window...

24:20.000 --> 24:23.457
Show me the streets, the
sun, the sky, everything.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.842
<i>Baji...</i>

24:25.625 --> 24:27.925
<i>It is night time here.</i>

24:28.125 --> 24:30.008
<i>You can't see anything.</i>

24:35.000 --> 24:37.980
Well, hallelujah, sis. You know,
it's about time you started driving.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.624
I'm just doing it for Tasha,
not because I need to.

24:40.625 --> 24:41.609
- I know.
- Debbie...

24:41.610 --> 24:44.499
You have to drive. You live in the suburbs.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.124
Here we have things
called subways and taxis,

24:48.125 --> 24:50.008
and buses.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.133
I also used to have a husband who drove.

24:54.333 --> 24:55.666
Oh! Ted.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.207
You know? It doesn't surprise me.

24:57.208 --> 25:01.008
On my street alone, there've been 3
divorces caused by screwing around.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.499
Well, Greenwich.

25:03.500 --> 25:04.929
Look, I don't understand...

25:04.930 --> 25:06.639
These men who cheat on their wives...

25:06.640 --> 25:08.541
How do they live with themselves?

25:08.542 --> 25:10.374
It's like pissing in the pool.

25:10.375 --> 25:14.624
Okay, maybe nobody saw you do it,
but you know the "yellow" is in there,

25:14.625 --> 25:17.825
and you got to swim around it,
pretending that it is clean.

25:18.542 --> 25:21.624
Where do they find all these skanks?

25:21.625 --> 25:23.291
Is there a vending machine?

25:23.292 --> 25:24.874
They just like them young.

25:24.875 --> 25:26.957
Can mould them however they like,

25:26.958 --> 25:28.249
teach them tricks.

25:28.250 --> 25:31.550
Like waking them up every
morning with a nice blow-job.

25:33.042 --> 25:35.541
Maybe that's all Ted ever really wanted.

25:35.542 --> 25:38.374
Honestly? It's Nirvana for them.

25:38.375 --> 25:40.050
Then why do we do it?

25:40.542 --> 25:42.791
It's way too much work.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.492
Oh my God, Why do you think
they call it a "job"?

25:48.542 --> 25:50.467
Oh my God.

25:50.542 --> 25:54.133
No. This mouth is retired, okay?
With a full pension.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.508
High five.

26:00.708 --> 26:02.332
He get over-excited.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.633
Calm down.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.383
High give.

26:09.625 --> 26:11.499
He wants support?

26:11.500 --> 26:13.832
Or 25% share of your income.

26:13.833 --> 26:17.289
He claims he supported you while you
pursued your career. I know. I know.

26:17.290 --> 26:19.749
This is the man who was
jealous of my career.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.889
He criticized everything I did

26:21.890 --> 26:23.416
to undermine me.

26:23.417 --> 26:24.791
Wendy, it's normal.

26:24.792 --> 26:28.258
Each side asks for the outrageous and
they meet somewhere in the middle.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.092
Don't take it personally.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.883
Just give him everything.

26:35.625 --> 26:38.592
If he agrees to be castrated.

26:39.583 --> 26:42.383
He'll let you stay in the
house if you buy him out.

26:46.167 --> 26:48.624
I can't possibly afford that.

26:48.625 --> 26:51.342
Or split 50-50 if you sell.

26:54.958 --> 26:57.092
I have to move out?

26:59.875 --> 27:01.707
I am that house.

27:01.708 --> 27:05.508
It's like asking me to move out of me.

27:06.833 --> 27:09.791
- Maybe it's too big now.
- I can't believe this.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.791
It's where we raised Tasha.

27:11.792 --> 27:14.092
It's where we were happy.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.758
It's...

27:19.083 --> 27:20.800
Okay.

27:22.667 --> 27:25.050
It's where we were idiots.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.166
And we squandered our marriage.

27:28.167 --> 27:30.209
And we never made love,
and we should have.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.249
And we never fucked, but we should have.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.457
And we read and read and read.

27:34.458 --> 27:37.175
And went totally fucking blind.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.791
I want my house.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.342
I want my house.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.925
I want my house, I want my...

27:50.958 --> 27:52.082
I want my house.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.541
I want my house!

27:53.542 --> 27:54.842
I want my house!

28:02.375 --> 28:06.190
We've got another guy coming
up right now... Probably...

28:07.583 --> 28:09.550
ICE. Who are you?

28:10.417 --> 28:13.541
Darwan Singh Tur, American citizen.

28:13.542 --> 28:16.175
- Let's see your papers.
- Yes, sir.

28:22.125 --> 28:23.707
What have we got?

28:23.708 --> 28:26.082
How come they let you in, Darwan?

28:26.083 --> 28:27.883
Political asylum, sir.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.791
In 2000.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.467
You got in under the wire.

28:36.083 --> 28:37.717
Preet!

28:38.375 --> 28:39.624
Preet!

28:39.625 --> 28:41.508
Oh my God!

28:41.625 --> 28:43.300
Preet!

28:43.750 --> 28:46.300
Preet? Preet Preet Preet.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.633
Preet.

28:47.708 --> 28:49.300
Oh, my God...!

28:49.500 --> 28:53.100
- I'm sick of this.
- Take your time, take your time, they're gone.

28:55.458 --> 28:57.416
Really thought they had me this time.

28:57.417 --> 29:00.967
Oh! They took Teji and Raam.
Thank God you're safe.

29:02.833 --> 29:05.050
Only till next time.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.291
I will find us another place.

29:16.292 --> 29:17.457
No.

29:17.458 --> 29:20.300
I'm gonna live with my
girlfriend in Chinatown.

29:22.333 --> 29:23.791
You have a girlfriend?

29:23.792 --> 29:26.291
They won't look for me if I'm with her.

29:26.292 --> 29:28.092
She is Jewish.

29:30.875 --> 29:34.800
Come on, Uncle D, you had to know
I was going sometime, right?

29:36.583 --> 29:38.758
This is a very poor decision.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.374
My sister will blame me.

29:41.375 --> 29:43.625
Don't worry, I'll just tell her: "Maji,

29:44.375 --> 29:46.717
this is America,

29:47.208 --> 29:49.342
and I can do what I want...

29:50.458 --> 29:53.800
as long as they don't ask for my papers."

30:09.000 --> 30:13.207
Point your eyes at the middle
of the lane, the same as a gun.

30:13.208 --> 30:16.508
Your peripheral vision sees all the rest.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.249
Oh! Osama. I thought we killed you.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.800
Shut up! Ass-holes!

30:23.000 --> 30:25.300
Ass-holes! Shut the fu...

30:27.667 --> 30:30.541
- Does that happen to you often?
- Everyday.

30:30.542 --> 30:32.542
People try to push your buttons...

30:32.583 --> 30:35.582
But you don't engage with them,
especially when you drive.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.550
Now you're on top of a cross-walk,

30:38.667 --> 30:42.342
next time stop where
you can see the lines.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.425
You have the light.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.800
Get out of the way, ass-hole.

30:50.167 --> 30:53.133
Oh my God, Goddamn it!

30:54.208 --> 30:55.809
Don't lean on the horn.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.654
It's not a boat. Just a short tap.

30:58.875 --> 31:03.383
I just... I don't understand why men have
to do that! Wag their balls in your face?

31:04.167 --> 31:07.374
I think it's time to discuss road rage.

31:07.375 --> 31:10.374
You must learn to be calm and relaxed.

31:10.375 --> 31:13.832
Not only to drive, but
also in your life, as well.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.999
And how do you manage that?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.624
Prayer helps me. I pray everyday.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.166
I unfriended God a long time ago.

31:21.167 --> 31:23.508
I'm mad at your God too.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.499
I'm sorry.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.633
Tell me why you want to drive?

31:36.042 --> 31:37.791
To go somewhere else.

31:37.792 --> 31:39.874
And how do you want to get there?

31:39.875 --> 31:41.383
How?

31:41.875 --> 31:44.499
Do you want to arrive in one
piece or two pieces or three?

31:44.500 --> 31:46.758
Don't patronize me.

31:49.167 --> 31:50.883
Look at me.

31:55.875 --> 31:59.967
It doesn't matter what is going
on in your life out there.

32:00.292 --> 32:03.050
You must shut it out.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.467
When you are here, when you
are at the wheel of a car...

32:08.792 --> 32:10.967
this is all there is.

32:11.708 --> 32:14.508
Your life right now.

32:16.042 --> 32:18.425
So, take care of it, please.

32:43.542 --> 32:45.092
Hi.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.175
Come on in.

32:48.958 --> 32:50.342
You look fine.

32:51.125 --> 32:52.967
Therefore I am.

32:59.708 --> 33:02.199
So many choices when you're single.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.207
Do I get a one bedroom or a two?

33:05.208 --> 33:08.758
Or... a high-rise or a low-rise?

33:09.542 --> 33:12.300
We're looking for a place in Nyack.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.092
- That's a long commute.
- I enjoy the drive.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.624
You're leaving me "The Joy of Sex"?

33:27.625 --> 33:30.575
Nah, it's yours. I gave it
to you for Valentine's Day.

33:31.833 --> 33:33.592
I don't remember reading it.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.842
Well, you put it in a drawer.

33:37.375 --> 33:40.975
Well, hand it here, let's see if
there is anything we didn't cover.

33:47.167 --> 33:48.874
The missionary.

33:48.875 --> 33:50.175
Check.

33:51.125 --> 33:53.133
Standing. Check.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.175
Rear entry.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.883
Check.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.523
Okay, I guess that's it.

34:20.524 --> 34:25.123
No, I... I've found some photos...
that you might want?

34:25.542 --> 34:27.300
Pass it to me.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.800
Tasha was what? Six?

34:31.833 --> 34:33.467
She was eight.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.342
Okay.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.257
This is hard.

34:47.792 --> 34:49.425
Yes.

34:54.250 --> 34:57.300
I am finding I can do hard things.

34:59.125 --> 35:02.800
- I'm learning to drive, you know?
- Oh, that's a scary thought.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.999
I can drive, I can keep
a clean house and...

35:08.000 --> 35:10.541
- Hey...
- I can wear a tight skirt.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.883
I can make cherry pop.

35:15.167 --> 35:17.041
- And I can make you love me again.
- No.

35:17.042 --> 35:18.675
I can... I can...

35:19.500 --> 35:22.499
I can give you what you need.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.842
Wendy, come on now.
This... This just isn't you.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.332
Since when...?

35:27.333 --> 35:30.008
Since when did you become a lap dancer?

35:31.042 --> 35:33.175
Oh my God...

35:34.292 --> 35:36.675
Sweetheart. Don't.

35:36.750 --> 35:38.082
Nice.

35:38.083 --> 35:40.383
Hold on. Holy shit!

35:49.708 --> 35:51.291
I'm here, I'm here, I'm coming! I'm coming!

35:51.292 --> 35:53.207
- I don't wanna hear it, pal.
- Sorry, sorry.

35:53.208 --> 35:56.166
My wife just kicked me out. And I
got a bunch of shit in the car.

35:56.167 --> 35:58.957
- Not my problem. Read the sign.
- Dude, come on please, man.

35:58.958 --> 36:01.541
- You know the drill.
- You can't take it!

36:01.542 --> 36:03.133
Damn!

36:10.500 --> 36:12.800
She's not that kind of a woman.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.166
And how do you know?

36:14.167 --> 36:17.041
She would be modest, I think.
This would shock her.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.207
Trust me, Uncle D.

36:18.208 --> 36:20.999
- All women, they want these things.
- No no.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.449
I don't want her to get the idea
that this is how I think of her.

36:23.450 --> 36:24.582
It's disrespectful.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.332
Oh come on. It's bad enough that
you don't understand women.

36:27.333 --> 36:29.758
But you don't even understand yourself.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.633
Just look at it.

36:32.417 --> 36:33.624
Preet.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.050
It's distracting.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.300
Huh! Distracting.

36:38.875 --> 36:41.008
Oh Shit. Sorry.

36:42.208 --> 36:43.883
No, no.

36:44.250 --> 36:45.883
No, no.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.925
Okay.

36:49.083 --> 36:50.675
I'm lost.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.089
Wendy, how do you know if you put in

36:53.090 --> 36:55.842
enough salt and pepper
when you're making a stew?

36:58.375 --> 36:59.999
- You taste it.
- Right.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.789
So what do you do when you lose track
of which way the car is pointing

37:02.790 --> 37:04.800
when you parallel park?

37:08.708 --> 37:09.874
You taste it?

37:09.875 --> 37:13.207
You just let the car
move back a tiny bit

37:13.208 --> 37:15.166
and see which way it goes.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.300
Taste the direction.

37:18.042 --> 37:20.999
- And then you adjust the seasoning?
- Right.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.550
You adjust a little bit and a little bit.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.291
And now I've made myself hungry.

37:26.292 --> 37:28.508
I'll go home and make myself a curry.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.383
You look very nice today.

37:37.875 --> 37:39.467
Thank you.

37:39.542 --> 37:41.892
Wendy, what does a women like for a gift?

37:44.375 --> 37:46.967
I don't know. Candy or...

37:47.000 --> 37:48.582
flowers.

37:48.583 --> 37:51.883
Speaking for myself... a book of poetry.

37:52.750 --> 37:56.999
My husband gave me that on our first
date and every anniversary.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.883
He'd mark a certain love poem

37:58.958 --> 38:03.624
and he ask me to read it as
he lay his head on... on my lap.

38:03.625 --> 38:05.175
It was a perfect gift.

38:06.167 --> 38:08.207
It's a fine idea.

38:08.208 --> 38:09.967
What about you?

38:10.167 --> 38:12.207
What present you like?

38:12.208 --> 38:14.050
A check, of course!

38:19.958 --> 38:22.300
- Bye.
- Next time.

38:45.250 --> 38:46.717
Hi.

38:51.625 --> 38:55.166
How can you claim the Moroccan
lamp as a pre-marital asset?

38:55.167 --> 38:57.675
We bought it together, Ted!

38:58.708 --> 39:00.300
Hold on.

39:05.625 --> 39:07.082
Hear that?

39:07.083 --> 39:09.499
That's me tearing it in half,

39:09.500 --> 39:12.133
so now you can shove it up both your ass,

39:12.542 --> 39:14.300
and your lawyer's.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.374
Are they ever gonna fix
the air conditioning?

39:24.375 --> 39:26.925
I will take you some place cooler.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.416
Oh my God!

39:31.417 --> 39:33.041
- It is a bridge.
- Yes.

39:33.042 --> 39:35.207
Today you are going over a bridge.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.416
I can't. I have a fear of heights.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.166
We'll take it slowly. Now go straight.

39:39.167 --> 39:41.059
Please! Please don't make me do this!

39:41.060 --> 39:42.374
Wendy you must move.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.874
Why are you forcing me
to do this, Darwan? Why?

39:44.875 --> 39:48.300
Because I know what you
can do better than you.

39:48.458 --> 39:50.175
Oh, my God!

39:50.542 --> 39:52.383
Oh, my God!

39:52.625 --> 39:55.758
Do not look down, focus on
the middle of the lane.

39:55.833 --> 39:58.883
It's just another road,
only it's in the sky.

40:00.583 --> 40:02.999
- Don't look down, don't look down.
- It's terrifying.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.166
Yes terrifying! Fear is good.

40:05.167 --> 40:08.175
When you are afraid, you
pay more attention.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.050
No more tuning out, Wendy.

40:10.083 --> 40:12.166
We got a lot of merging to do.

40:12.167 --> 40:13.457
Thank you.

40:13.458 --> 40:15.592
That was a very nice man.

40:15.708 --> 40:17.041
Very nice man.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.541
You are not breathing properly.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.508
You're hyperventilating.

40:20.542 --> 40:22.300
Breathe.

40:25.708 --> 40:27.633
Now we are on land.

40:27.667 --> 40:28.832
Okay.

40:28.833 --> 40:31.082
You can let go the death grip now.

40:31.083 --> 40:32.592
Congratulations.

40:33.958 --> 40:36.300
Queens is part of New York too.

40:36.708 --> 40:41.124
We don't have skyscrapers, and
Times Square and Trump palaces but...

40:41.125 --> 40:43.124
We only have more people.

40:43.125 --> 40:45.425
Many different people. Families.

40:46.250 --> 40:48.249
You have family here too?

40:48.250 --> 40:50.999
Just my nephew. My sister's son.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.717
She lives in Punjab.

40:53.208 --> 40:56.008
- Your parents?
- They are dead.

40:57.375 --> 40:59.300
I didn't tell you to turn.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.967
I'm showing you my Queens.

41:04.958 --> 41:07.008
This is where I grew up.

41:08.208 --> 41:09.800
You're from Queens.

41:13.625 --> 41:16.300
You played a good joke on me.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.508
You...

41:21.167 --> 41:24.800
My dad used to sit in his
car, just like that.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.100
Listening to the game and the radio.

41:28.167 --> 41:31.967
Whenever my mother kicked him out of
the house, which was pretty often.

41:32.042 --> 41:33.967
He took off one day.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.092
Never saw him again.

41:40.125 --> 41:43.925
My sister and I were left
alone to raise our mother.

41:57.583 --> 42:01.050
I can't believe you got me here.
I'm allergic to Queens.

42:01.083 --> 42:03.258
There will be a reward.

42:05.375 --> 42:06.967
Wait here.

42:26.042 --> 42:27.550
Hi, Dad.

42:28.333 --> 42:30.925
Here I am sitting in your seat.

42:31.958 --> 42:33.916
Mets are playing Arizona.

42:33.917 --> 42:36.300
It's about time you took the wheel.

42:37.208 --> 42:42.041
The car is the greatest thing in
the history of human invention.

42:42.042 --> 42:44.624
Forget your house, you can live in here.

42:44.625 --> 42:46.166
Sleep in the back.

42:46.167 --> 42:49.207
Heat up a TV dinner on the engine.

42:49.208 --> 42:51.133
Here's your shower.

42:54.083 --> 42:55.999
Pee in the gas tank.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.717
And when the spirit moves
you, you just drive away.

43:03.542 --> 43:05.800
Like you drove away?

43:06.875 --> 43:09.133
And never came back.

43:17.042 --> 43:19.175
Here is your reward.

43:21.542 --> 43:23.133
You have a masters?

43:23.750 --> 43:27.550
I was university professor, like my father.

43:27.958 --> 43:30.249
Why do you teach driving?

43:30.250 --> 43:31.939
For a better job, I would have to...

43:31.940 --> 43:35.050
Take off my turban, shave off my beard.

43:35.833 --> 43:38.508
People think I look dangerous.

43:38.708 --> 43:40.957
But this is how I know who I am.

43:40.958 --> 43:43.550
And here it is too easy to forget.

43:43.792 --> 43:46.166
Do you ever go back to visit?

43:46.167 --> 43:48.300
I can never go home to India.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.999
It's part of political asylum.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.957
I couldn't get to see my dad
before he passed away last year.

43:53.958 --> 43:56.707
I miss my mother's funeral too,

43:56.708 --> 43:59.092
because then I was in prison there.

44:00.875 --> 44:03.425
- Why?
- For nothing.

44:05.958 --> 44:07.883
For being a Sikh.

44:09.958 --> 44:13.059
The police had already killed my brother.
They said it he was a terrorist

44:13.060 --> 44:16.124
and they had to shoot him
because he ambushed them.

44:16.125 --> 44:17.541
But it was a lie.

44:17.542 --> 44:19.832
Then they punished the rest of the family.

44:19.833 --> 44:24.300
All of us were tortured. My
father, my uncle, even my mother.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.050
They left my sister alone,
because she was too young.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.633
Back then,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.457
there was no justice for Sikhs.

44:33.458 --> 44:35.842
How long were you in prison?

44:37.667 --> 44:39.592
Long time.

44:43.542 --> 44:46.570
But here is the ocean.

44:46.667 --> 44:48.717
Punjab is nowhere near water.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.999
It's very late.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.166
I have time.

44:56.167 --> 44:58.967
We have to get you back to Manhattan.

44:59.125 --> 45:00.425
Oh my God!

45:04.000 --> 45:05.383
Put on your lights.

45:05.792 --> 45:07.342
I don't know where it is.

45:08.167 --> 45:09.925
It's right there.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.041
- Oh my God!
- You have the light. Go now!

45:15.042 --> 45:17.008
Foot off the brake! Go! Go!

45:28.000 --> 45:29.874
Why did you stop?

45:29.875 --> 45:31.082
I... I don't know.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.289
Oh! My dear God.

45:32.290 --> 45:34.582
You gotta be kidding me. Son of a bitch.

45:34.583 --> 45:36.842
I just got through paying for this car.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.541
You stupid fucking Arab.

45:38.542 --> 45:39.957
- Stop.
- It was my student.

45:39.958 --> 45:42.082
What's the matter with you?
Get off the fucking road.

45:42.083 --> 45:42.530
Stop.

45:42.531 --> 45:45.360
- Fucking motherfucker. What the fuck, man?
- Stop!

45:49.000 --> 45:50.207
Shit.

45:50.208 --> 45:52.124
- Fuck that shit!
- Cops are here.

45:52.125 --> 45:53.600
- They should take this fucking ass-hole...
- Allright, what happened?

45:54.125 --> 45:55.883
He stopped for no reason.

45:56.458 --> 45:58.124
No reason at all.

45:58.125 --> 46:00.374
It was my student driver, sir.

46:00.375 --> 46:03.124
- Where you from?
- Richmond Hill.

46:03.125 --> 46:05.300
Yeah, but where you from?

46:05.625 --> 46:06.999
India.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.500
- You got papers?
- I am an American citizen.

46:09.625 --> 46:11.666
Excuse me, officer.

46:11.667 --> 46:15.207
- I was driving and I caused the accident.
- I understand, ma'am.

46:15.208 --> 46:17.707
I'm gonna say two words: racial profiling.

46:17.708 --> 46:19.999
- Were they harassing you?
- Wendy, stay in the car.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.100
- Listen ma'am, it was a no fault accident, okay?
- Okay.

46:23.875 --> 46:26.124
- I was the driver!
- Get back in the car.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.550
Everybody get back in the car.

46:30.167 --> 46:31.374
Are you okay?

46:31.375 --> 46:32.967
Put on your seat belt.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.874
Is... is everything okay?

46:35.875 --> 46:38.457
What is okay?
I've a car bashed up to hell!

46:38.458 --> 46:40.124
My boss angry at me!

46:40.125 --> 46:42.124
- I'll pay to have it fixed.
- You pay nothing.

46:42.125 --> 46:43.707
The school has insurance.

46:43.708 --> 46:46.999
But the $500 deductible,
who pays that? I do.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.249
Do you know how much I
have to work for $500?

46:50.250 --> 46:51.832
Tie it at the back.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.249
I can give you that.

46:53.250 --> 46:55.850
I cannot take your money.
That is not how I am.

46:55.875 --> 46:58.582
What were you doing? All you
had to do was drive straight

46:58.583 --> 47:00.874
through an intersection,
everything is clear.

47:00.875 --> 47:02.175
And you stop.

47:02.208 --> 47:05.041
My mind wandered... just for a second.

47:05.042 --> 47:07.207
Bad things can happen, just for a second.

47:07.208 --> 47:10.207
You can lose everything if
you don't get another try.

47:10.208 --> 47:13.675
- I was thinking.
- I don't have time to take you home now.

47:14.292 --> 47:16.957
I have to meet somebody at the airport.

47:16.958 --> 47:18.258
And I'm very late.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.082
Yes, oh thank you sir.

47:23.083 --> 47:24.999
- Drive safe, sir.
- Yes, sir.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.300
Please.

47:37.125 --> 47:38.675
Wait here.

48:12.792 --> 48:14.092
Jasleen?

48:17.792 --> 48:18.999
Darwan?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.633
Hello, do you not seen the sign?

48:22.125 --> 48:23.842
Never mind.

48:25.250 --> 48:27.133
Here is for you.

48:29.208 --> 48:31.550
Open it, please, please. Open.

48:41.333 --> 48:43.957
These are beautiful poems for you to read.

48:43.958 --> 48:45.467
William Wordsworth.

48:49.375 --> 48:50.832
Thank you, Mister.

48:50.833 --> 48:52.624
No Mister.

48:52.625 --> 48:56.133
We will speak only English now.
You will learn fast.

48:59.125 --> 49:00.758
Thank you.

49:00.875 --> 49:04.300
I've not tasted these in 12 or 13 years.

49:04.667 --> 49:05.967
So...

49:07.292 --> 49:08.883
No, no.

49:09.417 --> 49:10.925
Come.

49:14.042 --> 49:16.041
We've had a little accident.

49:16.042 --> 49:19.082
That's my student, Wendy.
Wendy, this is Jasleen.

49:19.083 --> 49:20.633
Hi.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.041
Hi.

49:22.042 --> 49:23.457
Can I help?

49:23.458 --> 49:24.666
Oh my goodness.

49:24.667 --> 49:26.592
I'm gonna get in the back.

49:27.542 --> 49:30.707
Cannot put these in the trunk because
it's full of rain, it's flooded.

49:30.708 --> 49:32.300
I got it.

49:33.208 --> 49:34.374
No, I want...

49:34.375 --> 49:37.175
- Be carefully.
- No problem, it will be safe.

49:37.417 --> 49:39.467
Hang this on the hook.

49:39.792 --> 49:40.999
My dress.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.791
It is our wedding dress.

49:42.792 --> 49:44.592
You're getting married?

49:44.667 --> 49:47.425
Speak slowly so she could understand.

49:47.875 --> 49:52.633
You get... A... marry?

49:52.750 --> 49:55.050
Yes. Tomorrow. We are very happy.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.342
Oh! You two?

50:04.917 --> 50:06.258
Hurry.

50:09.792 --> 50:11.592
- You two?
- Yes.

50:11.958 --> 50:13.624
Can you imagine how embarrassing this is?

50:13.625 --> 50:16.999
I look like a drowned dog. I have
to pick her up in a pile of junk.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.758
This is not how our first
meeting was to be.

50:20.667 --> 50:23.041
We have to take Wendy home first.

50:23.042 --> 50:24.842
Look, here is America.

50:27.542 --> 50:29.092
Excuse me...

50:29.208 --> 50:32.467
You've never, you've never met her?

50:32.583 --> 50:34.957
She's from a village near where I grew up.

50:34.958 --> 50:37.217
My sister picked her out for me.

50:38.083 --> 50:41.999
If my sister picked out a husband for me,
he would be some dick-less.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.999
Yes, you are better off...

50:44.000 --> 50:46.800
That is why you're alone and crazy.

50:50.083 --> 50:52.499
- Just drop me at the subway.
- No, you are my guest.

50:52.500 --> 50:55.791
That is not how we are. We do everything for
our guests before we think of ourselves.

50:55.792 --> 50:57.717
That is the Sikh way.

52:09.167 --> 52:13.300
Uncle D, now that you're married,
a double date in Chinatown?

52:13.583 --> 52:14.967
Cheeky.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.925
Always. I'll take that as a yes.

52:21.292 --> 52:22.832
If you want a lot of light,

52:22.833 --> 52:25.207
you gotta sacrifice your space.

52:25.208 --> 52:26.749
Or...

52:26.750 --> 52:29.050
Buy a bigger place

52:30.167 --> 52:32.374
and you sacrifice your light.

52:32.375 --> 52:34.675
Oh excuse me, I gotta take this call.

52:35.250 --> 52:36.749
Did they take the offer?

52:36.750 --> 52:38.332
No?

52:38.333 --> 52:39.832
They want all the furniture?

52:39.833 --> 52:41.666
Well, I don't know, the mother just died.

52:41.667 --> 52:44.249
It all belong to her. I don't know
how she's gonna fell about that.

52:44.250 --> 52:47.249
You know how people are when people die.
I don't know. I don't know.

52:47.250 --> 52:49.082
I do not know whether she's gonna want it.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.666
Alright.

52:50.667 --> 52:54.258
So, you want to take a
look, see at the kitchen?

52:54.292 --> 52:56.217
- Sure.
- Come on.

53:53.167 --> 53:58.092
<i>Dear Wendy, I'm very sorry for my
behaviour during our last lesson.</i>

53:58.292 --> 54:01.633
<i>The car is fixed now, it runs very well.</i>

54:02.292 --> 54:04.508
<i>But where is the driver?</i>

54:06.083 --> 54:08.666
You made me wait. Punishing me.

54:08.667 --> 54:09.916
Maybe.

54:09.917 --> 54:12.957
Well, I am happy we will
finish what we started.

54:12.958 --> 54:15.508
I will not let you fail
your license, Wendy.

54:15.792 --> 54:17.207
How was the wedding?

54:17.208 --> 54:19.749
It was a very, very beautiful ceremony.

54:19.750 --> 54:23.999
It says: "When a man marries a
woman, they become one spirit.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.791
We think and feel the same."

54:25.792 --> 54:28.508
There is no differences between us.

54:29.958 --> 54:32.883
- You don't mention love?
- Of course.

54:33.125 --> 54:35.550
Love is the one route to God.

54:35.750 --> 54:38.467
God doesn't want anyone to be alone.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.592
Seat belt first.

54:43.125 --> 54:46.800
So what's it like waking up
married to a complete stranger?

54:48.042 --> 54:51.217
I think you don't approve
our arranged marriage.

54:51.250 --> 54:53.249
Check your mirrors.

54:53.250 --> 54:55.217
I'll try to explain.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.832
We hold our families very close.

54:57.833 --> 55:00.342
They know you better than anyone else.

55:00.708 --> 55:04.624
They are more objective about who
is the right person for you.

55:04.625 --> 55:08.457
If left to your own devices,
you could pick the wrong one.

55:08.458 --> 55:10.050
You choose your ego.

55:11.542 --> 55:14.800
I don't know what I
believed about marriage...

55:15.917 --> 55:18.258
Except that it would always be there.

55:22.792 --> 55:24.467
Right signal.

56:15.708 --> 56:17.675
More tomatoes...

56:18.000 --> 56:20.300
make a nicer colour.

56:20.917 --> 56:23.300
I'm not having tomatoes.

56:23.750 --> 56:25.592
Jasleen,

56:26.000 --> 56:28.842
I give you money, you can go out

56:28.958 --> 56:31.383
and buy tomatoes.

56:31.917 --> 56:34.541
I not know where.

56:34.542 --> 56:37.492
Just walk down the street.
There are plenty of stores.

56:54.542 --> 56:56.550
A little too much ghee.

56:57.583 --> 56:59.008
I know much.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.500
If you don't have conversation with people
outside, how're you gonna pick up English?

57:10.542 --> 57:11.791
TV.

57:11.792 --> 57:13.092
Huh?

57:13.708 --> 57:16.258
Then tell me what you learned today.

57:24.833 --> 57:27.300
That is Spanish, not English.

57:44.208 --> 57:45.999
Oh, here she is.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.332
Sorry, I'm late.

57:47.333 --> 57:49.207
My sister is never on time, so...

57:49.208 --> 57:50.832
Wendy, this is Peter.

57:50.833 --> 57:51.830
He is a squash buddy of mine.

57:51.831 --> 57:53.631
He annihilates me once a week.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.800
Very pleased to meet you.

57:59.417 --> 58:00.925
Hello.

58:01.708 --> 58:04.249
How does a '99 Meursault sound everyone?

58:04.250 --> 58:07.300
- That sounds great.
- Exquisite. Sounds expensive.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.050
You speak French?

58:16.167 --> 58:18.207
<i>J'ai étudié à Paris.</i>

58:18.208 --> 58:19.624
<i>Formidable.</i>

58:19.625 --> 58:21.592
You kept your accent.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.332
I've got a full reserve for Monday night.

58:24.333 --> 58:25.633
What's it gonna be?

58:26.083 --> 58:28.082
I told you not to do this!

58:28.083 --> 58:30.124
So? He's a Banker.

58:30.125 --> 58:33.425
He's also a opera lover
and he's quite a gourmet.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.457
What is his political affiliation?

58:36.458 --> 58:38.249
I have no idea.

58:38.250 --> 58:41.624
Listen to me! He was very hard
to wrinkle for this dinner.

58:41.625 --> 58:43.925
You know, a lot of women are after him.

58:44.250 --> 58:47.666
Honey! It is really time for
you to get back in the saddle.

58:47.667 --> 58:49.467
Oh, and roll in the hay?

58:49.542 --> 58:52.869
I love these dude-ranch-metaphors
coming a Connecticut matron.

58:52.870 --> 58:53.583
Oh, please.

58:53.584 --> 58:56.582
You know? You could use a little
hormone upgrade yourself.

58:56.583 --> 58:58.633
You know what I'm talking about.

59:00.083 --> 59:02.675
You don't understand how much I envy you.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.967
I love nothing more than
to live a life of a mind.

59:06.167 --> 59:09.374
I'd like something to
take my mind off my mind.

59:09.375 --> 59:12.300
That's why I do yoga, meditate.

59:12.375 --> 59:15.050
- Tantric Yoga.
- I do Ambien.

59:16.542 --> 59:18.883
I knew you'd be clever.

59:19.042 --> 59:20.600
I love your reviews.

59:21.300 --> 59:23.999
By the end, I always feel
like I've read the book.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.207
Well, that accounts for the drop in sales.

59:26.208 --> 59:29.008
I read a lot of e-books.
Download 'em all the time.

59:29.125 --> 59:32.207
I like to hold the book in my hand.

59:32.208 --> 59:33.499
Well, me too.

59:33.500 --> 59:35.749
It has to be the right book, though.

59:35.750 --> 59:39.633
I love the smell, the feel... of the paper.

59:41.417 --> 59:42.541
Here.

59:42.542 --> 59:45.258
Try my blood orange sorbet.

59:54.833 --> 59:56.842
Isn't that remarkable?

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:27.133
Are you ever going to cum?

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:31.925
I've cum a few times.

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.383
I just don't ejaculate.

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:37.342
I do tantric sex.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.467
Can we stop, please?

01:00:42.958 --> 01:00:44.633
Of course.

01:00:50.917 --> 01:00:52.425
Jesus!

01:00:52.792 --> 01:00:54.300
Oh, Jesus!

01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:57.499
I wanted to make you cum again.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.883
I'm...

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:01.300
I'm...

01:01:03.417 --> 01:01:05.675
I'm too tired.

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.925
But thank you.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.592
So...

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:16.717
When were you planning on ejaculating?

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:17.999
I don't know.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.800
Next time maybe.

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:22.508
Next time after that.

01:01:23.583 --> 01:01:25.249
What do you do in Thursday?

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.800
I can ejaculate on Thursday.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:36.217
I have a driving lesson.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.383
I see you're more comfortable
now at high speeds.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.008
You're very quiet today.

01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:28.217
- Just focusing.
- That's good.

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:31.633
Pass him. Put on your
signal and foot to the gas.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.749
Very good.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.416
You only need a little courage

01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:42.300
and a little gas.

01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:44.791
"A perfect woman,

01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:50.425
nobly planned to warm,
to comfort, and command,

01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:54.467
And yet her spirit still in bright,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.342
With something of angelic light."

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:01.467
Do you like that?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.291
Now...

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:08.133
You read me this one...

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:09.925
To me.

01:03:37.667 --> 01:03:40.342
Don't tell me you can't read English.

01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:44.000
When I was 14...

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.249
My baba took me out of school.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.758
My God!

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.291
Nothing I do is good for you.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.300
Calm down.

01:04:01.708 --> 01:04:04.666
What do you want? What... What do I do?

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:07.332
You don't go out, you don't try
to learn anything about America.

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.416
You should be curious, you have a mind.

01:04:09.417 --> 01:04:10.791
Like Wendy!

01:04:10.792 --> 01:04:13.792
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy!
Why're we talk about Wendy?

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:22.425
Jasleen, tell me why you're so unhappy.

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:26.508
You are never here.

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:28.582
Where?

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:31.300
- Where? Where all the time?
- I'm working.

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:35.425
I want a good life for our family.

01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:38.300
You don't want with me.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.800
I'm stupid.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:43.050
I cook too much ghee.

01:04:49.542 --> 01:04:51.842
If you accumulate more than 15 points...

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.166
You fail.

01:04:53.167 --> 01:04:56.383
Now, what are the things in the
test worth 15 points?

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:59.467
- Parallel parking.
- What else?

01:05:00.083 --> 01:05:02.550
- Broken U-turn.
- What else?

01:05:03.958 --> 01:05:06.717
- Going too fast.
- Or too slow. What else?

01:05:07.958 --> 01:05:09.999
Not observing the right of way.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.207
If you fail any one of these 15 pointers,
you automatically fail your test.

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:15.541
Are you sure I'm ready?

01:05:15.542 --> 01:05:20.258
Wendy, don't forget what I know:
you're a very determined woman.

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:24.592
Now tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me.

01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:27.633
What kind of a car are you going to buy?

01:05:27.792 --> 01:05:28.957
Something cheap.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:31.300
My divorce is costing me a fortune.

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:34.217
- Next.
- Oh, God, God, Darwan...

01:05:35.167 --> 01:05:37.791
- Next.
- If you get nervous, just listen.

01:05:37.792 --> 01:05:40.242
You'll hear my voice
telling you what to do.

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:47.342
Next!

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.217
Hello. My name is Wendy.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.092
Start the car.

01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:26.717
Pull away from the curb, please.

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:57.133
60 points.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.300
I went blank.

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:02.999
Why did I ever think I could drive?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.249
Wendy, your next test will go better.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:06.832
I don't belong in the road.

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:09.166
I'm only trained to do one trick:

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:13.508
ignore everything and everybody around me.

01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:16.332
You know there is a reason
some people are alone,

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:18.166
because they deserve to be.

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:20.499
I ignored my husband. I
ignored my daughter.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.457
No wonder he cheated on me.

01:07:22.458 --> 01:07:24.383
I openly cheated on them.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.383
Because my first and foremost love was...

01:07:29.458 --> 01:07:31.249
for words.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:33.300
I wrapped myself on them.

01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:37.925
And then I look at you.

01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:42.207
There is a thousand things in this
world to divide two people...

01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:46.342
and you and Jasleen
manage to be one spirit.

01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:51.842
Just tell me,

01:07:52.917 --> 01:07:56.217
if she ever disappointed
you, if she ever...

01:07:56.583 --> 01:07:58.342
fell short in some way,

01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:03.925
Would you cheat on her?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.092
No, I would never.

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:13.258
Darwan, you're a good man.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.499
You give me faith.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.666
Thank you.

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:19.716
No, I... I don't want this any-more.

01:08:20.832 --> 01:08:23.300
I don't know how to talk to her.

01:08:27.125 --> 01:08:28.791
She's not educated.

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:30.499
We don't like the same things at all.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.841
She's...

01:08:33.707 --> 01:08:37.425
She's scared of America.
She's scared of me, she hides.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.550
You know words, Wendy.

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:45.675
What do I say?

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.758
That you...

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.383
You never stop trying.

01:08:56.167 --> 01:08:58.383
That you fight for her.

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:04.300
Everyday you tread across the divide.

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:08.716
Because she's worth that.

01:09:12.167 --> 01:09:14.508
Is this what you want to hear from him?

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:18.591
Not words.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.341
You know what I miss?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.341
The way he touch my face.

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:36.591
Just...

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:41.508
holding my face between his two hands.

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:53.999
Can you come inside? I left my chequebook.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.300
You can pay me next time.

01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:00.675
No next time.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.383
I'm done with driving.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.883
You shouldn't give up, you only
need a little more practice.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:15.383
No, I don't have it in me, Darwan.

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:18.217
I'm sorry.

01:10:19.708 --> 01:10:22.008
You make me say goodbye.

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:24.967
I guess. Yeah.

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:32.550
Thank you.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.550
You did your best.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.383
Not enough.

01:10:44.625 --> 01:10:46.300
Goodbye, Wendy.

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:49.425
What is this...?

01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:51.383
I can't read that!

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.633
Sorry?

01:12:06.292 --> 01:12:08.499
You see the picture, you
know what she wants.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.217
No, ma'am.

01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:14.383
You work here, and you don't know
where is the sanitary napkin?

01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:16.342
Aisle-five.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.425
Oh! They are so rude here.

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:24.300
You have to demand your respect in America.

01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:27.092
Where are you from?

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.717
- Dadiala.
- Ah, my uncle lives there.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.717
Why don't I see you at the temple, darling?

01:12:42.542 --> 01:12:45.217
How many days have you been married?

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:48.383
Enough.

01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:55.383
Mata.

01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.082
There he is.

01:12:57.083 --> 01:12:58.832
Mata, hello.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:02.133
Darwan Singh, why do you shut
up this pearl in the house?

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:05.582
I assure you she is free to go anywhere.

01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:07.832
What a husband? Leaving
you alone all the time.

01:13:07.833 --> 01:13:10.082
Don't worry, darling.
We'll make our own fun here.

01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:11.842
We don't need him.

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:15.133
- I'll make dinner.
- Never mind, Jasleen.

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:18.425
Never mind. Enjoy your new friends.

01:13:18.458 --> 01:13:20.675
I'll pick up something to eat.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.999
That is right. Leave her to us.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.700
You won't recognize her
when we're done with her.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.383
- I'm going.
- Go, go, you're ruining our fun.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.800
Arghh! So much stuff!

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:41.249
Believe me! I threw out tons.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.916
Tasha, thank you for helping, but I
think you have to get back on the road.

01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:47.300
You have a long drive.

01:13:48.292 --> 01:13:50.192
I don't think I'm gonna go back.

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:55.041
- What?
- I love farming, but I...

01:13:55.042 --> 01:13:58.633
Mainly was there to be
with this guy, and now...

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:02.624
suddenly, he's decided
to go back to Dartmouth.

01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:06.383
So I'm all alone and all
my friends are gone.

01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:10.925
I'm just so embarrassed.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.550
Come here.

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:17.758
Can I stay here with you?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.050
Oh, I would love that.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:26.300
I would so love that.

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:28.041
But you can't.

01:14:28.042 --> 01:14:30.508
Tasha, if you move in here,

01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:35.383
You would be in a spirit of
failure and that's deadly.

01:14:37.792 --> 01:14:40.124
You have to see this thing through.

01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:44.550
You have to go back to Vermont
and harvest your ass off.

01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:48.467
- I'll come visit you, I promise.
- Okay.

01:14:49.125 --> 01:14:53.092
- It's too far.
- I'm gonna find way, I'm gonna...

01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:56.758
I'm gonna find a way.

01:14:57.458 --> 01:14:59.842
Hi, its Wendy.

01:15:07.292 --> 01:15:09.467
I'm gonna try again.

01:15:11.042 --> 01:15:12.467
Yes.

01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:20.624
How is Jasleen?

01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:22.508
She's very busy.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:25.800
She goes to school now, taking classes.

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:33.133
So, how do you like your new apartment?

01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:36.717
It's an adjustment, I'm tasting it.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.383
- You're so quiet.
- You're not doing anything wrong.

01:16:13.333 --> 01:16:15.425
Played a chicken meat.

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:18.592
That looks like a pass.

01:16:22.042 --> 01:16:24.758
- I wish you had been there.
- I was there.

01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:27.416
Thank you, ma'am. I was there.

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:28.749
Thank you.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.041
I was there.

01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:32.707
Did you hear my voice
telling you what to do? No.

01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:35.633
- You didn't need it.
- No.

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:37.332
<i>Oh my God...</i>

01:16:37.333 --> 01:16:38.999
I don't know...

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.457
I just... I wasn't as nervous this time.

01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:44.999
<i>- That's so amazing.</i>
- Yeah.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.291
<i>- So happy for you, Mum.</i>
- Thanks.

01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:49.124
<i>So, when are you gonna drive up and see me?</i>

01:16:49.125 --> 01:16:50.199
I'm coming soon.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.082
- It's an classic American car.
- It's a good price.

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:54.299
Can't go wrong with that.

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.707
You could drive this one
right off the lot today.

01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:58.958
You know, if you're
okay with the colour.

01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:01.249
I never thought about red, but...

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.457
Red is happy, it's...

01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:05.832
what the bride wears for
her wedding in India.

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:08.425
Yes, but what does it say about me?

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:10.717
I'm a hot little number?

01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:13.300
Hussie on board?

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:15.300
It says...

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:19.217
"Don't fuck with me."

01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:32.207
Allright now, who'd be purchasing the
car today, Sir? You or your wife?

01:17:32.208 --> 01:17:34.675
Ah... She's not my wife.

01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:39.541
But... Whose name will
the car be under, Sir?

01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:40.957
Really, we're not together.

01:17:40.958 --> 01:17:43.008
Honey, it's okay.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.133
- I'm buying it.
- Allright.

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:52.092
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

01:17:54.042 --> 01:17:55.467
How do I...?

01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:57.707
How do I get home?

01:17:57.708 --> 01:18:00.258
You can follow me to the bridge.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:02.883
Darwan.

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:05.633
Darwan, thank you.

01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:10.217
I'll be hearing your voice in my head

01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:11.925
for a long time.

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:14.425
That would please me.

01:18:15.417 --> 01:18:16.967
Well,

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:19.675
here I go.

01:18:19.917 --> 01:18:21.383
Wendy.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.457
Could we go...?

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:29.457
Somewhere we can celebrate,
a dinner, please?

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:32.666
Or just a coffee sometime, just to chat.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:35.041
- I can't.
- I want to see you again.

01:18:35.042 --> 01:18:36.675
I know.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.842
The trouble is...

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:43.550
What?

01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.300
What?

01:18:48.542 --> 01:18:50.842
You're a good man.

01:18:55.167 --> 01:18:57.300
You're my faith.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:13.967
Wendy.

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.508
Seat belt first.

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:27.758
Darwan.

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:32.800
I didn't expect you.

01:21:08.042 --> 01:21:09.675
Jasleen,
