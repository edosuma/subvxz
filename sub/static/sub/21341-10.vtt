Dino Dana!

00:13.247 --> 00:18.119

various dinosaurs roaring]

00:40.274 --> 00:42.576
Dino Dana!

00:42.610 --> 00:45.546
[roar]

00:50.884 --> 00:53.421
[Dana]
"Get That Incisivosaurus."

00:58.592 --> 01:02.163
[coos]

01:06.734 --> 01:08.802
There you are,
Incisivosaurus.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.609
Just stay
right there and...

01:15.643 --> 01:17.611
I was so close.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.281
Dana.
Guess what?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.582
My favorite cartoon
from when I was a kid

01:21.615 --> 01:22.783
is finally out online.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.518
You go to come see.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.287
That's where my bologna
sandwich went.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.655
Dad!
Dana.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.524
You scared
the Incisivosaurus away.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.326
That's this dinosaur.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.794
I'm trying to get
one of its feathers

01:33.827 --> 01:35.663
to complete my dino
feather collection.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.699
Look, I got
the Sinornithosaurus,

01:38.732 --> 01:40.134
Dromaeosaurus,

01:40.168 --> 01:41.802
Microraptor,
Troodon,

01:41.835 --> 01:45.173
Therizinosaurus,
Compsognathus

01:45.206 --> 01:46.774
but look
what's missing?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.709
The inside-of-a-saurus?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.444
Incisivosaurus.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.812
That's quite
the collection, nugget.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.381
I'm going to go
clean my foot off

01:53.414 --> 01:54.848
and then we're going
to watch cartoons.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.352
[squawks]

02:00.921 --> 02:02.356
I'll be back.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.561
I've been waiting
for this cartoon

02:07.595 --> 02:08.929
to be released
for forever.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.265
I used to watch this
every Saturday morning.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.366
You're going to
love this.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.302
[***]

02:14.335 --> 02:15.736
[Dad laughs]

02:18.272 --> 02:19.773
What?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.775
You don't
find this funny?

02:21.809 --> 02:24.278
This is a classic.
This is the Fox and the Hare.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.315
[***]

02:27.348 --> 02:28.816
What's a hare?

02:28.849 --> 02:31.852
The bunny
is the hare.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.222
That's what they
used to call it, I think.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.624
In the olden days?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.559
Just watch the...

02:39.960 --> 02:44.232
[***]

02:44.265 --> 02:45.733
Ouch.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.668
Is the fox okay?

02:47.701 --> 02:49.403
He's fine.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.474
The fox is always
trying to catch the hare.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.977
Must be really hungry.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.846
Isn't it hilarious?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.315
You know what's
really hilarious?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.817
The Incisivosaurus.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.653
A turkey sized,

03:05.686 --> 03:08.622
bucktoothed,
super fast dino.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.890
It's a theropod,

03:09.923 --> 03:13.361
just like the T-Rex,
Dromaeosaurus

03:13.394 --> 03:14.862
and a bunch of
other meat eaters.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.366
Oh, so
you were using

03:18.399 --> 03:20.568
my bologna
sandwich as bait.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.836
Which is not what you're
going to do with this one.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.974
[laughs]

03:27.007 --> 03:29.277
Look, look watch
what's going to happen.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.811
See the fox dug a pit

03:30.844 --> 03:33.647
and put the carrot
as bait for the hare.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.750
but guess what's
going to happen.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.951
I don't know

03:37.985 --> 03:39.520
But you just gave
me a great idea

03:39.553 --> 03:41.289
how to get
my dino feather.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.625
Alright, but hurry.
You're going to miss the...

03:44.658 --> 03:47.528
[***]

03:50.664 --> 03:51.965
He never learns!

03:54.302 --> 03:55.803
Dana!

03:55.836 --> 03:57.838
[laughs]

04:04.678 --> 04:06.580
[Dana]
Closer...

04:06.614 --> 04:08.849
Closer...

04:08.882 --> 04:11.051
Little closer.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.386
That's it.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.755
Mmm yum,
bologna sandwich.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.527
What?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.829
Why didn't you
fall into the pit?

04:21.862 --> 04:23.464
[sighs]

04:30.804 --> 04:32.806
All you needed to do was
stand right here and...

04:40.448 --> 04:43.584
[chirps]

04:43.617 --> 04:45.353
Ah.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.487
I should have known.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.855
You're turkey sized.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.491
Probably too light
to fall inside the pit.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.026
I need a new plan.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.430
Oh.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.033
I'll be back!

05:00.067 --> 05:02.035
[chirps]

05:03.971 --> 05:05.506
Again.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.310
Dad, the pit didn't work.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.080
Never works on
the hare either

05:13.113 --> 05:16.049
and mine.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.086
Wish I'd known that
before I tried it.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.989
Ooh, look what the fox
is trying now.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.958
[***]

05:28.028 --> 05:30.831
A trap that
falls from above.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.766
Being light won't help
the Incisivosaurus

05:32.800 --> 05:34.334
get away from that.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.638
Spoiler alert.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.106
This one's not
going to work either.

05:39.139 --> 05:44.011
[***]

05:46.847 --> 05:48.449
Oh...

05:50.851 --> 05:54.054

I don't have a net but
this box is just as good.

06:07.835 --> 06:12.706
[***]

06:17.845 --> 06:19.813
Yes!

06:21.181 --> 06:23.016
Time to collect
my feather.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.655
Huh?

06:27.688 --> 06:30.123
Where's
the Incisivosaurus?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.534
You bit through the box

06:40.568 --> 06:42.903
with your big buck teeth.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.476
I'll be back.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.082
Don't even
think about it.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.117
And what did you do
to that Water Slider box?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.886
Did you chew
through it?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.621
I didn't.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.591
The Incisivosaurus did
with its big buck teeth.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.960
So, you didn't
get the feather?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.462
No.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.997
It was too light
for the pit.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.732
And too chompy
for the box.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.066
I'm going to need
another trap.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.705
Dana, hand it over.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.946
[***]

07:25.979 --> 07:28.015
[laughs]

07:28.048 --> 07:32.920
[***]

07:34.855 --> 07:36.490
Looks like
you're the fox

07:36.524 --> 07:38.091
and you're not fast enough
to catch the hare.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.927
That's it.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.530
I've got to make myself
as fast as the Incisivosaurus.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.932
I don't have
any rockets

07:44.965 --> 07:47.200
but I do have a...

07:48.969 --> 07:50.804
Water slider!

08:06.153 --> 08:08.622
Jokes on you,

08:08.656 --> 08:11.659
I took the stuff to make
another sandwich.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.097
And I'm out of bologna.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.544
You win.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.315
What?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.851
You're eating
the lettuce?

09:13.754 --> 09:15.656
But you're
a carnivore, aren't you?

09:17.991 --> 09:19.793
I guess not.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.194
That means
you're an herbivore

09:21.228 --> 09:23.063
in a family
of carnivores.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.766
This is an amazing
discovery

09:25.799 --> 09:27.901
and you just
gave me an idea.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.004
Tomato
for a feather?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.213
Thanks,
Incisivosaurus.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.788
Dad, guess what?

09:47.821 --> 09:49.322
You found your feather?
Yes.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.291
Collection complete.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.926
Hm.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.096
But that's not all I got.
Here, Dad.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.666
Hmm.
It's a bit wet.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.334
And there's no lettuce
but thank you.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.936
You're welcome.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.925

I can't see anything!

11:31.959 --> 11:33.293
The light...

11:33.326 --> 11:34.862
Where'd it go?

11:34.895 --> 11:36.329
Where'd what go?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.998
The Compsognathus.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.000
I'm trying to figure out
dino experiment 520:

11:40.033 --> 11:42.069
Which dino had the best
eyesight for hunting.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.838
And it definitely
wasn't the Nanuqsaurus.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.439
The Nanuq...
...saurus!

11:46.473 --> 11:49.309
[Dana] It's one of the coolest
dinosaurs of all time.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.444
And I mean literally cool.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.446
Its name means
"polar bear lizard,"

11:53.480 --> 11:56.183
and it lived up north
where it's dark half the year.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.385
So it could see really
good in the dark--

11:58.418 --> 12:00.420
and it's what I am right now.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.290
So that's why you took
my night vision goggles.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.192
"Borrowed..."

12:05.225 --> 12:06.794
And yes, thank you.

Mm-hm...
[gasp]

12:08.561 --> 12:09.863
I hear your dad calling.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.231
I didn't hear anything.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.400
Oh, I definitely heard--
Oh! There he is again.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.935
Really?
"Dana!"

12:14.968 --> 12:16.236
Yep, that's him calling.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.438
Pretty sure that was you.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.407
Nooo!
C'mon.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.821
C'mon, Dana.
Time to go home.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.790
Uh, Dad...?

12:36.824 --> 12:38.291
Over here.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.894
Right. [chuckle]
I knew that.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.195
Sorry, sir...

12:42.229 --> 12:43.864
Ma'am?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.199
When's the last time you
had your eyes checked?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.068
Me?
Oh, I'm fine.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.303
We came to get Dana looked at,
right, Nugget?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.172

Over here.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.876
Right.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.046
Uh, Dad, I think you're
the one who needs glasses.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.048
Oh no, I'm fine.
I can see perfectly.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.950

Alright, let's get you
back in the chair.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.161
I'll have you
seeing like an eagle.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.495
An eagle?

13:15.528 --> 13:17.064
Some paleontologists
think that the T-Rex

13:17.097 --> 13:18.932
could see like an eagle...

13:18.966 --> 13:20.567
[growl]

13:20.600 --> 13:24.404
...Which make sense because
birds came from dinosaurs.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.007
But how good can an eagle see?

13:27.040 --> 13:30.510
Well, at eagle
can see like...

13:30.543 --> 13:33.213
a person looking
through binoculars.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.514
Can I borrow those?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.049
Yes.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.286
Dad, can I finish my
dino experiment in the park?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.154
It's T-Rex time!

13:41.188 --> 13:44.024
Okay, you stay where
I can see you.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.358
Thanks, Dad!

13:45.392 --> 13:47.160
Right this way.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.897
Oh...

13:49.930 --> 13:51.865
Yeah, just follow me.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.301
No, no. Here.
Yeah. Mm-hm...

13:54.334 --> 13:57.004
Forward... No.
That's sideways. This way.

13:58.071 --> 14:03.010
[***]

14:08.081 --> 14:12.986
[***]

14:14.087 --> 14:16.189
Binocular view,
activate.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.659
Dino experiment 520,
continue.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.195
I know the Nanuqsaurus
had night vision

14:22.229 --> 14:23.596
but couldn't touch
the Compsognathus.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.398
Now let's see
if the T-Rex

14:25.432 --> 14:27.901
has better luck
with eagle vision.

14:27.935 --> 14:28.936
Ah-ha!

14:28.969 --> 14:30.437
With my T-Rex eagle vision,

14:30.470 --> 14:32.105
I can spot you, Compy,

14:32.139 --> 14:34.507
from far way
before you can see me.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.608
Ha-ha!

14:35.642 --> 14:37.877
Now I just need to catch it.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.580
[squawking]

14:44.651 --> 14:46.954
If I'm going to catch it,

14:46.987 --> 14:49.389
I need to get closer
without it seeing me.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.992
Just missed me.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.596
[panting]

14:58.198 --> 14:59.933
[hiss, squawk]

15:01.001 --> 15:02.936
No...
Now it saw me!

15:04.604 --> 15:07.307
[Compy squeaking]

15:07.340 --> 15:09.476
I'm gonna get you,
Compsognathus,

15:09.509 --> 15:11.578
just like a T-Rex would.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.684
T-Rex eagle vision is way better

15:17.717 --> 15:19.552
than Nanuq night vision,

15:19.586 --> 15:22.122
but it doesn't help me
with how fast you are.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.490
Wait up, Compy!

15:26.093 --> 15:27.527
Where are you?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.564
There you are!

15:31.598 --> 15:33.967
[squawking]

15:35.035 --> 15:36.403
[panting]

15:36.436 --> 15:37.971
Where'd it go?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.607
Oh no!

15:40.640 --> 15:43.476
The Compy camouflaged itself
in the yellow flowers.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.278
Looks like T-Rex vision

15:45.312 --> 15:47.680
isn't the best eyesight
for hunting after all.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.249
Now what?

15:50.317 --> 15:54.354
[***]

15:55.422 --> 15:56.523
[squawk]

16:00.460 --> 16:02.595
Dad!
Doctor Webster!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.197
You won't believe it.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.698
I almost caught
the Compsognathus

16:05.732 --> 16:08.401
using T-Rex
eagle vision.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.070
Hold that thought,
nugget...

16:12.072 --> 16:13.640
Whoa, that's what
you look like?

16:13.673 --> 16:15.275
Dad!

16:15.308 --> 16:17.444
I was so close to
catching the Compsognathus

16:17.477 --> 16:20.013
but it used camouflage
to get away

16:20.047 --> 16:23.116
by hiding in some plants that
are the same color as it.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.618
T-Rex eagle vision
doesn't help you

16:25.652 --> 16:26.753
see through camouflage.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.157
Ooh!
I like your glasses.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.624
They're snake pattern.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.627
Y'know, Dana, some snakes
have great vision.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.729
Too bad there's
no snake dinos.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.466
There are.
The Titanoboa.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.101
The Titana-who-a?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.170
This is the Titanoboa.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.038
Biggest snake of all time.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.606
But how do snakes see?

16:46.639 --> 16:50.277
Well, some snakes have
infrared vision...

16:50.310 --> 16:52.679
I'm a kid.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.083
Some snakes see the heat
that comes off of a body...

16:56.116 --> 16:57.817
I wonder what
that looks like.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.188
Well, why don't you
see for yourself...

17:01.221 --> 17:03.623
with these heat
vision goggles?

17:05.692 --> 17:08.795
[Dana] Wow, this is what
heat vision looks like?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.197
You two look so weird.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.567
Kinda like rainbow-ey
alien blobs.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.070
But why would snakes
wanna see like this?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.571
Well, because, um...

17:18.605 --> 17:21.608
Even if I try to hide
behind some plants...

17:21.641 --> 17:23.576
[Dana]
I can still see you!

17:23.610 --> 17:26.346
Heat vision is amazing!

17:26.379 --> 17:29.349
Camouflage won't work
on Titanoboa vision.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.318
Can you imagine?

17:31.351 --> 17:33.253
The largest snake
ever discovered

17:33.286 --> 17:35.222
also had the most
awesome eyesight.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.527
I gotta get back to the park
to see if the Titanoboa

17:40.560 --> 17:42.229
had the best eyesight
for hunting.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.496
And I need to take...

17:43.530 --> 17:46.199
...BORROW your goggles.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.667
Go ahead.
Thank you!

17:47.700 --> 17:50.137
It's Titanoboa time!

17:52.372 --> 17:54.407
Ooh.
Look at these ones.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.144
Oh...

17:57.177 --> 17:59.612
I look like a model,
basically.

18:02.715 --> 18:07.187
[***]

18:12.325 --> 18:17.197
[***]

18:22.735 --> 18:25.238
Heat vision,
activate.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.407
Dino experiment
520 continues.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.442
I know the Compsognathus was

18:29.476 --> 18:32.212
too fast for the Nanuqsaurus's
night vision

18:32.245 --> 18:35.715
and too sneaky for
the T-Rex's eagle eye vision,

18:35.748 --> 18:37.717
but maybe the Titanoboa's
heat vision

18:37.750 --> 18:39.686
will be the best
eyesight for hunting.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.825
Weeeee!

18:48.761 --> 18:52.865
I just need to find the Compy
so I can hunt it.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.567
[squeaking]

18:54.601 --> 18:56.803
That sounded like
the Compsognathus!

18:56.836 --> 18:59.172
[squeak]
There you are.

18:59.206 --> 19:03.343
Whoa, you're really
letting off a lot of heat.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.312
I'm gonna get you,
Compsognathus!

19:07.747 --> 19:09.382
Wait up, Compy!

19:10.450 --> 19:13.220
[squawking and chirping]

19:13.253 --> 19:14.887
I'm right behind you!

19:14.921 --> 19:17.490
There's no escape.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.660
[squawking and chirping]

19:20.693 --> 19:23.496
Okay, maybe you
CAN escape...

19:24.564 --> 19:27.500
[***]

19:28.568 --> 19:30.470
Ah-ha!

19:30.503 --> 19:31.838
I see you!

19:34.274 --> 19:37.210
Trying to camouflage
again, huh, Compy?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.845
[panting]
Not so fast.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.385
You ran from the Nanuqsaurus
night vision,

19:45.418 --> 19:47.387
hid from the T-Rex
eagle vision,

19:47.420 --> 19:51.190
but there's no escaping
from Titanoboa heat vision.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.426
[squawk]

19:53.460 --> 19:56.663
Gotcha! Yes!
I did it!

19:56.696 --> 19:58.231
Nom nom nom!

19:58.265 --> 20:00.567
I'm not gonna eat you, silly.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.670
Thanks for all your help,
Compsognathus.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.775
[hissing and squawking]

20:08.808 --> 20:11.844
[dinos growl]

20:11.878 --> 20:14.481
Dino Experiment 520 is solved.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.384
Even though the Nanuqsaurus
had great night vision

20:17.417 --> 20:19.686
and the T-Rex had
Eagle binocular vision,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.288
it wasn't a dino that had

20:21.321 --> 20:22.955
the best eyesight
for hunting after all.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.857
It was the Titanoboa,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.794
a prehistoric snake with
super-hot heat vision.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.766
[squawking]

20:33.800 --> 20:35.635
You wanna play again?

20:35.668 --> 20:36.836
Alright.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.406
But this time,
you're the hunter.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.978
