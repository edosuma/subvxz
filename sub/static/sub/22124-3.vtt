I'’m so sorry, Maze.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.800
I have no complaints.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.541
I just try and keep things
interesting.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.332
Yes, of course.

the job is losing its thrill.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.064
I don'’t know.

02:32.108 --> 02:35.459
I think I need... more.

Maybe you should take a breath

all that you have.

from me, Maze.

to follow your greatest desire.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.348
Uh, I was just calling to see
if you'’re okay, that's all.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.394
Mm. I'’m fine, okay?

18:54.437 --> 18:56.135
In fact, I'’m great.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.485
This Rivers guy is a lot harder
to catch than I thought.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.139
Ah, so you haven'’t
found him yet?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.923
Oh, I found him.
And he got away.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.447
And that'’s a good thing?
What if he comes after you now?

19:04.491 --> 19:05.927
You think he would?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.929
Maze... [sighs]

19:07.972 --> 19:10.018
Rivers is dangerous in ways

19:10.061 --> 19:12.020
that I don'’t think
you'’re prepared for.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.630
He'’s emotionally dangerous.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.023
I don'’t even know
what that means.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.329
I know, and that'’s the problem.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.418
If...

19:20.550 --> 19:22.248
CHLOE:
What the hell are you doing?

19:22.291 --> 19:24.424
Reminding you that you
are not Maze'’s mother.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.817
She'’s got her big-girl
pants on. She'’s fine.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.342
Really? Because she caught
Rivers, and he got away.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.431
[laughs]:
Oh, I doubt that.

19:31.474 --> 19:32.954
Don'’t touch my nose.
It'’s true.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.956
Lucifer, if he already
got in her head...

19:34.999 --> 19:37.437
He hasn'’t. He probably just
came at her with a flamethrower

19:37.480 --> 19:39.221
or something, which'’ll just
piss Maze off even more.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.614
Now, did you tell her

19:40.657 --> 19:42.572
we found out where
Rivers has been staying?

19:42.616 --> 19:44.531
I didn'’t.
I don'’t know if I'm going to.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.185
I'’m worried about her.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.708
Clearly, you'’re not.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.275
No, I'’m not.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.885
I just sent her
the address.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.495
Lucifer...A flamethrower,
Detective.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.280
Or maybe even an Uzi.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.282
Either way, it'’s nothing
Maze can'’t handle.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.240
I'’m sure.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.512
[dramatic classical music
playing over speakers]

20:24.701 --> 20:27.051
Nice place.

20:27.095 --> 20:30.446
Wish you had
some rock and roll, though.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.448
Well, I'’ll
tell you what.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.624
I'’ll run down to the store,
pick up a couple records,

20:34.668 --> 20:35.973
be right back.
Stay.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.714
There'’s always time
for a drink.

20:37.758 --> 20:38.759
[chuckles]

20:40.500 --> 20:41.588
Wha...?

20:44.982 --> 20:46.506
[grunts]

20:46.549 --> 20:48.769
Come on.
Didn'’t we do this already?

20:48.812 --> 20:51.119
It'’s not going to be
so easy this time.

20:53.426 --> 20:54.775
That'’s a new one.

20:54.818 --> 20:57.081
Look, I really don'’t
want to fight you.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.953
Mm, I really do.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.564
Okay.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.653
Play time'’s over.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.176
I don'’t think so.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.315
I get it now. The
handcuffs, the music.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.186
You wanted to
dance with me.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.624
Or I wanted to cover
the sounds of screaming.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.020
I know a little kung fu.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.420
I'’m beginning to think you
wanted me to escape that bar.

21:31.464 --> 21:32.900
You like chasing me, don'’t you?

21:32.943 --> 21:34.902
I like a challenge.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.599
Shame it'’s not you.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.431
[grunts]I don'’t want to shoot you.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.216
Yeah, well, you had no problem

21:45.260 --> 21:47.218
killing those two people
in cold blood.

21:47.262 --> 21:51.005
[sighs] Look, I'’ve done a lot
of terrible things in my life.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.615
That'’s not one of them.

21:52.659 --> 21:53.660
I was framed.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.358
[groans, grunts]

21:56.402 --> 21:57.838
I don'’t care.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.405
Yeah, well, you should.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.276
'’Cause Herrera's
gonna betray you next.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.757
CHLOE:
Lieutenant Herrera?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.541
And you must be
Detective Decker.Uh, yes.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.369
Pleasure.
Pleasure.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.415
I know what this is about,
and I-I didn'’t mean

22:09.458 --> 22:11.634
to stick my nose
in another cop'’s case.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.027
Wait, wait.
You think I'’m mad?

22:13.070 --> 22:14.376
[laughs]
Are you kidding me?

22:14.420 --> 22:15.812
You got me a new lead.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.379
I'’m here to thank you.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.380
Oh.

22:18.424 --> 22:19.773
Uh, you know,

22:19.816 --> 22:20.817
but now that you
cracked it open...

22:20.861 --> 22:22.645
Mm-hmm?...if you don'’t mind,

22:22.689 --> 22:24.865
I want to carry this one
across the finish line.

22:24.908 --> 22:25.735
Are you sure?
I'’m happy to help.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.041
Don'’t worry,

22:27.084 --> 22:28.782
I'’ll give you all the credit.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.697
It'’s just that
this one means a lot to me.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.177
The one that got away, you know?

22:33.221 --> 22:34.483
Right.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.224
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.487
Oh.

22:38.531 --> 22:39.793
Yeah.

22:39.836 --> 22:40.881
Yeah.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.056
Thanks, Detective.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.409
Yeah, I used to work
for Herrera, just like you.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.411
He sent me to track
people down, or worse.

22:49.455 --> 22:52.283
Then, one day, I quit.
He didn'’t like that.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.590
That'’s a really nice story,
but like I said...

22:54.634 --> 22:56.331
You don'’t care.
I don'’t.

I'’ve seen you before.

Hi.

23:32.498 --> 23:35.675
All right.

Come on, Maze, pick up.
Pick up.

Hey, it'’s me again.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.690
I-I know you think
I'’m just being a worrier,

23:50.733 --> 23:52.779
but there is something strange
going on with this case,

23:52.822 --> 23:54.737
so call me back ASAP.

Hello?

No? Didn'’t think so.

All right, we got to get
the hell out of here.

We can'’t just wait
for her to mow us down.

Oh, I'’m not waiting.

to a gunfight?

See?

I don'’t need a gun
to save your ass.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.143
Come on.

the detective quite like it.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.767
She'’s afraid that
Maze will get bamboozled

25:07.810 --> 25:10.030
into helping
this handsome con man.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.161
It'’s preposterous.

not concerned?

What if it'’s not a
bounty she'’s after?

25:23.913 --> 25:25.872
What if she'’s trying
to prove something?

25:25.915 --> 25:27.613
What, that she can
scare an entire country?

25:29.310 --> 25:32.269
Or that her life has meaning.

talk right now, Maze.

Oh, Mazikeen,
you little rascal.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.822
Did you shoot the fellow?
Well done.

26:02.865 --> 26:03.997
No, I didn'’t shoot him.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.216
Some psycho from
room service did.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.610
Well, so much for
Canadian hospitality.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.612
Look, I don'’t have time
to explain, okay?

26:10.656 --> 26:12.309
How do I stop this human
from dying?

26:12.353 --> 26:15.443
LINDA: Take him to a hospital,
that'’s how.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.010
I mean, how many times
do I have to tell you

26:17.053 --> 26:18.620
I'’m not that
kind of doctor?

[Rivers screams, groans]

Whoa. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.756
First things first,

26:23.799 --> 26:25.584
did the bullet go
all the way through?

26:27.194 --> 26:28.238
I don'’t know.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.239
[screams]

26:29.283 --> 26:31.024
Ow! What are you doing?!

[gasps]
Get-- Will you s...

26:34.157 --> 26:35.506
Oh, no, it'’s
still in there.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.073
Good.Okay, all right.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.466
Well, in order to
stop the bleeding,

26:38.509 --> 26:40.642
you'’re going to have
to remove the bullet

26:40.686 --> 26:42.731
and stitch up
the wound.
Oh.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.341
Oh, yeah, you know what,
I'’m good.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.256
Relax, okay?

26:46.300 --> 26:47.562
I'’m great at
dismembering humans.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.042
How hard can it be
to fix one?

26:49.085 --> 26:51.087
Maybe you should
listen to him, Maze.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.002
I mean, it'’s everyone's right
to refuse treatment.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.396
He is my bounty and I am
taking him in one piece.

26:55.439 --> 26:56.745
[groans]
Just tell me
what to do, Doc.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.007
Uh, okay.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.531
Uh, find the hotel sewing kit.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.795
You can stitch him up
with that, and you'’ll need

27:02.838 --> 27:03.970
alcohol for the wound.

27:06.755 --> 27:07.974
[grunts]

27:08.017 --> 27:10.411
[panting]

27:11.586 --> 27:13.066
What?

27:13.109 --> 27:14.023
Well, you'’re not
thathandsome.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.721
That'’s helpful. Thank you.

27:15.764 --> 27:16.504
You'’re welcome.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.985
Got everything.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.160
What...

27:20.203 --> 27:21.335
Next.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.424
Well, you'’ll have to...

27:23.467 --> 27:25.339
fish out the bullet.[chuckles]

27:25.382 --> 27:27.820
Oh, you know what, I'’ve grown
kind of attached to it.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.604
I think I'’m gonna keep it.
Thank you, though.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.953
[grunts]

27:30.997 --> 27:32.172
And if you have
any sedatives,

27:32.215 --> 27:33.347
I highly recommend
he takes them.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.653
You got any drugs?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.002
What?Too bad.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.049
Sorry.

27:53.497 --> 27:56.413
You know, I-I got this.
I'’ll let you know if he dies.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.029
Is it me, or did
the most skilled torturer

just fluff that man'’s pillow?

28:07.642 --> 28:08.991
It'’s not you.

28:09.035 --> 28:11.298
Right.

28:11.341 --> 28:13.692
Then it'’s true.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.868
He broke my Maze.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.180
[grunts softly]

28:27.793 --> 28:29.708
Well, this is different.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.494
That'’s Miss Alien.

28:33.537 --> 28:37.019
Nothing weird happened,
if that'’s what you're wondering.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.238
I-I wasn'’t.

28:38.281 --> 28:39.892
But thank you.

28:39.935 --> 28:40.806
[groans]:
Oh.

28:40.849 --> 28:42.416

help this guy?

31:27.581 --> 31:29.148
The best thing to do

pin the murder on him.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.008
[chuckles] Okay, wait a
minute, all right? Wait.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.836
This is absurd.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.925
You can'’t possibly believe
a-a con man'’s story.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.492
We don'’t have to.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.885
We have testimony from the guard
you forced to lie.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.931
Uh, and the hit man
you hired

38:44.974 --> 38:46.498
is currently
in Canadian custody.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.022
But don'’t worry,
they gave you all the credit.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.719
You'’re under arrest.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.068
Oh, come on. Really?

38:52.112 --> 38:53.026
Yes. Really.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.810
And if it'’s
any consolation,

38:54.854 --> 38:56.769
I suggested we beat you to death
with our bare hands,

38:56.812 --> 38:59.075
but the detective insisted
we do it by the book.

38:59.119 --> 39:02.035
And considering I know where
you'’re eventually going to go,

39:02.078 --> 39:03.558
that'’s fine by me.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.000
[sighs]

39:17.442 --> 39:19.400
Thanks, Decker.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.358
[phone beeps]

39:23.883 --> 39:27.930
Well, looks like all
your whining finally paid off.

39:27.974 --> 39:31.456
Herrera just got arrested for
the murder of those two kids.

39:31.499 --> 39:32.935
[exhales]
So...

39:32.979 --> 39:35.242
So...

39:35.285 --> 39:37.157
so I'’m not a fugitive anymore.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.159
Yeah, which kind of screws me,

39:39.202 --> 39:40.552
'’cause you're also
not my bounty anymore either.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.380
Mm.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.990
No good deed.

39:44.033 --> 39:46.166
[both chuckle]

39:46.209 --> 39:47.689
[sighs]

39:49.822 --> 39:51.389
Did you hear
what I just said?

39:53.173 --> 39:55.001
You don'’t have to run anymore.

39:55.044 --> 39:57.917
You can... come home.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.573
Yeah, you don'’t get it.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.575
This doesn'’t end with Herrera.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.881
He'’s just a cog
in the machine.

40:05.925 --> 40:10.146
The people he works for,
they'’ll never stop chasing me.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.105
Okay.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.020
Dramatic much?

40:14.063 --> 40:16.979
If you worked for Herrera,
they know about you, too.

40:17.023 --> 40:18.328
Everything about you.

40:18.372 --> 40:19.982
I sincerely doubt that.

40:20.026 --> 40:24.030
Yeah, well,
you don'’t know them like I do.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.118
[groans softly]

40:27.207 --> 40:28.948
I can never stop running, Maze.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.822
But what if...

40:33.866 --> 40:35.998
what if you came with me?

40:38.261 --> 40:40.133
We can do this, Maze.

40:40.176 --> 40:42.004
You and me,
we'’re the same.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.398
No roots. No family.

40:46.226 --> 40:48.620
We can...
hit a new city every week,

40:48.663 --> 40:51.449

40:51.492 --> 40:54.756

like it'’s our last.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.324

Oh.

I, uh, can get you a new one.
