00:11.133 --> 00:12.933
-* Whatcha want,

00:12.967 --> 00:15.033

00:15.067 --> 00:18.900

-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.933 --> 00:20.700
-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:20.733 --> 00:23.500
-* Bad boys, bad boys,

00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.833 --> 00:29.200
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.233 --> 00:30.433
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.467 --> 00:32.333
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.367 --> 00:34.400
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:41.100
in a court of law.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.600
-Prior to becoming
a police officer,

00:43.633 --> 00:45.067
I was in the United States
Marine Corps.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.533
The day that I got out
of the Marine Corps.,

00:46.567 --> 00:48.067
I joined the Police Academy,

00:48.100 --> 00:50.733
and I was hired by
the Colton Police Department
a short time later.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.333
This department
and the city have

00:52.367 --> 00:54.633
a long, storied history
with law enforcement.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.567
US Deputy Marshal
Morgan Earp is buried

00:56.600 --> 00:58.667
in this city.
His brother, Virgil Earp,

00:58.700 --> 01:01.333
was our first town marshal.

01:01.367 --> 01:02.667
We're getting a call right now.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.400
Sounds like a subject
is on a bus, uh,
wielding a knife

01:06.433 --> 01:08.733
at passengers,
and the passengers
are still on the bus.

01:08.767 --> 01:11.533
So we're, uh, establishing
a perimeter on it now

01:11.567 --> 01:13.500
and trying to get
other passengers off the bus.

01:18.667 --> 01:23.400
-Okay, I want one of you guys
going in the front...
-Okay.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.200
-with... lethal-- with Taser.
-Taser. Okay.

01:26.233 --> 01:28.667
-You'll go with Taser,
and I'll go lethal.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.533
-Okay. I'll do commands,
and we'll just order him
to the ground,

01:31.567 --> 01:33.267
and then have one of you guys
come in there to cuff.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.333
-I'll be the cuff.
-Okay.

01:34.367 --> 01:35.800
-Go around.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.967
-Go that way. That way.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.300
Ready?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.500
-Hey, get down
on the ground, man.

01:45.533 --> 01:46.900
-What?
-Get down on the ground.

01:46.933 --> 01:48.333
Get down on the ground.
-I'm not wanted.

01:48.367 --> 01:51.067
-Both hands, down on the ground.
Get down on the ground!

01:51.100 --> 01:52.733
-Get down on the ground
or you're gonna get Tased.

01:52.767 --> 01:55.067
-Get down on the ground,
put your hands out!
-Stay down!

01:55.067 --> 01:56.300
-Put your hands out!
-I don't have to--

01:56.333 --> 01:57.733
-Keep your hands out!
Keep your hands out!

01:57.767 --> 02:00.800
Keep your hands out,
or you're gonna get Tased!

02:00.833 --> 02:02.967
-All right.
-Just don't reach,
just stay right there.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.533
-What's wrong? I thought--
-Stop fighting!

02:04.567 --> 02:05.833
Stop resisting!

02:05.867 --> 02:07.367
-(Taser crackling)
-Hey!

02:07.400 --> 02:09.067
-Put your hands
behind your back!
-Stop resisting!

02:09.067 --> 02:12.200
-Put your
hands behind your back!
-Stop resisting!

02:12.233 --> 02:15.100
-Hey, I'm sorry,
I saw an animal that was
trying to get me, man.

02:15.133 --> 02:16.833
-I gotta get this cuff on.
-Relax!

02:16.867 --> 02:19.300
-I'm sorry, I saw an animal
that was gonna kill me.
-Have one Tase.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.400
I don't wanna Tase.
-We got the knife?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.400
-Yeah, right there.
-I just got scared, bro.

02:23.433 --> 02:25.200
I saw animal that was
trying to kill me.

02:25.233 --> 02:27.200
-Yeah, affirmed.
-I'm so sorry.

02:27.233 --> 02:29.933
-He's detained.
-I'm not lyin',
I'm not on probation.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.900
But I saw an animal
that was trying to kill me.

02:31.933 --> 02:33.767
-Got any other knives?
-No knives.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.333
I just had one in my hand,
'cause I saw a lion or some
kind of animal who was tryin'

02:37.367 --> 02:39.900
to eat my people,
but I got scared.

02:39.933 --> 02:41.967
You guys should look
for one because--

02:42.067 --> 02:44.833
-Got the knife right here?
-Yeah, it's right there.

02:44.867 --> 02:48.633
I put it over there.
Do you have any ID on you, man?

02:48.667 --> 02:50.433
-I know who it is,
I've dealt with him before.

02:50.467 --> 02:51.800
I've gotten into a fight
with him before.

02:51.833 --> 02:53.567
He resists all the time, yeah.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.867
Let's stand him up,
and, uh, take him out
to one of the units.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.067
-Sit up.
There you go.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.367
-Up.
-Yes, sir.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.867
Did I have anything
illegal on me? Personally?

03:01.900 --> 03:05.133
Why am I being arrested?
-The probes came out here?

03:05.167 --> 03:07.300
-What is my offense,
for holding a knife?

03:07.333 --> 03:12.633
For threatening people?
-Yeah, but you were
pulling your knife out on...

03:12.667 --> 03:14.300
everybody on the bus.
-I did not...

03:14.333 --> 03:16.300
No, I just had it
in my pocket 'cause
I don't have anywhere

03:16.333 --> 03:17.833
to clip it on to my jeans.

03:17.867 --> 03:20.233
-Okay.
-I got trunks on.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.200
I didn't offend anybody
or say anything threatening,
did I?

03:23.233 --> 03:25.400
-Get him out of the bus.
-We're gonna go this way, okay?

03:25.433 --> 03:26.900
-Did I make a threatening charge
at somebody?

03:26.933 --> 03:29.333
-We found a meth pipe here.
We found some other drugs.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.967
We were telling him to put
his hands behind his back.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.833
He started tensing up on us,

03:33.867 --> 03:37.067
so we eventually ended up
using a taser to bring him
into custody.

03:40.967 --> 03:43.300
-Hey, what'd you guys find out?
-So, talking
with the bus driver,

03:43.333 --> 03:45.867
he was acting real erratic
when he came in.
-The suspect?

03:45.900 --> 03:47.233
-The suspect.
-Okay.

03:47.267 --> 03:48.967
-He had his knife
kind of brandished out,
blade was open.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.367
Swinging it around.
He was relatively close--
close enough for him

03:51.400 --> 03:53.233
to actually stab him.
-Mm-hm.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.333
-Just waving it around,
put it away, dropped it.

03:55.367 --> 03:56.767
Picked it out again.
-Okay.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.933
-So he was scared
for himself and also
for all the passengers.

03:58.967 --> 04:00.733
-There was a bunch
of passengers on there
too, right?

04:00.767 --> 04:03.833
-Yeah, he said he had, uh,
about 30-- 30 passengers
or so,

04:03.867 --> 04:05.667
-Okay.
-So of course he's gonna be
scared for himself,

04:05.700 --> 04:09.433
but also for all those people,
since he doesn't know
what he's capable of doing.

04:09.467 --> 04:10.667
-Yeah, absolutely.
-So.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.433
-And he's the one
that called us.
He jumped out,

04:12.467 --> 04:15.067
called us, and that's when
Corporal went on scene and
pulled everyone else out.

04:15.067 --> 04:16.667
-And then he started
pulling everybody else off?

04:16.700 --> 04:19.400
-Yeah.
-Um, and that's when
I walked up on you guys,

04:19.433 --> 04:21.767
right?
And we made our--
we formulated our plan?

04:21.800 --> 04:25.067
Um... when you came in,
you found-- there was a knife
in there, right?

04:25.100 --> 04:27.067
-Yeah, as soon as
he dropped down,
he left the knife

04:27.067 --> 04:28.967
on the chair,
so I picked it up and got it
out of the way,

04:29.067 --> 04:31.367
just if anything happened,
we started tussling with him

04:31.400 --> 04:34.367
or anything of the sort,
he wasn't able to grab it,
so it was out of reach of us,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.700
so we didn't have to worry
about him grabbing that
and trying to stab any of us.

04:37.733 --> 04:39.700
-And the bus driver's okay?
Not injured or anything?

04:39.733 --> 04:42.067
-He's okay, not injured,
doesn't want medical
attention, nobody needed

04:42.067 --> 04:44.167
medical attention.
All the other passengers
got on another bus

04:44.200 --> 04:45.267
and on to their destinations.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.367
-Okay.

04:47.733 --> 04:50.067
-Hey, sir, all I--
-What's your name, man?

04:50.067 --> 04:51.733
-Sean.
-Sean. Sean, right?

04:51.767 --> 04:53.367
-Yeah.
-What's--

04:53.400 --> 04:54.800
-I didn't threaten nobody.
-Okay, listen.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.167
-I thought I saw an animal
that was chasing the damn bus.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.767
-Let me ask you a question.
What's going on tonight, man?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.500
-I saw an animal
that scared me.
-What kind of animal was it?

05:02.533 --> 05:05.067
-It was some sort of cat,
an American cat.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.633
-A cat scared you?
-And everybody in Fontana--

05:06.667 --> 05:10.167
It was an American lion
or something like that?
-It was a lion or a cat?

05:10.200 --> 05:13.200
-And I saw-- everybody saw it
in Fontana.
-Cats are ferocious.

05:13.233 --> 05:17.500
-And it's a wild animal
that I seen before.
-Do you know where you are now?

05:17.533 --> 05:19.500
-In public. Yes, sir.
-Where at?

05:19.533 --> 05:22.433
-Uh... Well...
-What city?

05:23.933 --> 05:27.200
-Wow, that's a good question.
-Sean, do you know
what year it is?

05:27.233 --> 05:28.500
-Seventeen.

05:28.533 --> 05:32.133
-Okay.
Um, hey, are you on
any types of drugs,

05:32.167 --> 05:34.767
narcotics, stimulants,
anything like that?
-No, not at all.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.233
-When's the last time
you've done anything?

05:36.267 --> 05:38.067
-I smoke weed,
I got a card, that's it.

05:38.067 --> 05:39.567
-When did you last smoke weed?

05:39.600 --> 05:43.200
-Uh, I can smoke weed,
uh, daily. I did daily doses.

05:43.233 --> 05:44.833
-Daily?
Did you have it mixed
with anything?

05:44.867 --> 05:47.933
-Not at all. I haven't
even drank yet.
I was goin' to get a beer.

05:47.967 --> 05:50.733
-Hey, do you remember when
you had a knife in your hand?

05:50.767 --> 05:54.067
-I did not threaten
or hold it or--
What's the charge?

05:54.100 --> 05:56.633
-Well, we're gonna talk about--
-Brandishing?

05:56.667 --> 05:58.600
-No, we're--
-Aw, man. Don't put me in jail.

05:58.633 --> 06:02.467
Listen, I have every right
to protect myself
against a ferocious animal.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.133
-But you were on the bus
and the cat was outside, right?

06:05.167 --> 06:08.767
-Yeah, well, I was damn too
scared to get off, and I don't
even live in this area.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.067
-Well, unfortunately, you're
the only one that saw
that cat tonight.

06:11.067 --> 06:12.533
-All right, man,
here's what we're gonna do.

06:12.567 --> 06:15.067
We're gonna take you
to the station.
We're gonna get the, uh--

06:15.067 --> 06:16.967
give you a little bit
of medical attention,
all right,

06:17.067 --> 06:19.733
and get the Taser darts
out of you, and you're probably
gonna be going to jail tonight,

06:19.767 --> 06:21.933
okay?
-No, I didn't do anything wrong.

06:21.967 --> 06:24.900
-All right.
-What am I being charged with?

06:24.933 --> 06:28.733
-We found some paraphernalia,
we found some dope.
-There's no dope.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.067
Also, we believe you're
under the influence
of a stimulant right now.

06:31.067 --> 06:32.433
That's why you're gonna
be going to jail.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.833
-Excuse me.
Where did you find the dope?
-With your stuff.

06:34.867 --> 06:37.067
Sit back, Sean.
-There's nothing on me!

06:37.067 --> 06:39.933
You're a lyin' sack of (bleep)!
-I've had contacts
with him before.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.167
He obviously has
some type of a drug problem,

06:42.200 --> 06:43.933
always on some type
of a stimulant or--

06:43.967 --> 06:46.800
-Yeah, you can see his pupils
are pretty big. Giant.
-Yeah, his pupils are

06:46.833 --> 06:49.967
relatively good size,
obviously over the normal
amount of what it should be

06:50.067 --> 06:53.267
based upon, you know,
the amount of light
or darkness out here.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.433
-He's pretty angry right now.
-Yeah, it's probably
a good thing

06:55.467 --> 06:57.200
that he's going into custody
and going to jail.
-Yeah.

07:00.167 --> 07:03.400
-Most people we encounter
that are involved in some sort
of criminal activity

07:03.433 --> 07:06.400
tend to lie to us,
or try to cover their tracks

07:06.433 --> 07:08.500
and make things seem
not so bad.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.467
But if what they're telling us
sounds suspicious

07:10.500 --> 07:13.433
or doesn't seem to add up,
we'll just keep asking questions

07:13.467 --> 07:15.933
and we're eventually able
to poke holes in their story

07:15.967 --> 07:17.767
and get the truth out of them.

07:19.467 --> 07:22.600
Uh, right now we're en route
to a dispute between brothers.

07:22.633 --> 07:26.100
One of the brothers
has armed himself
with a handgun.

07:26.133 --> 07:28.667
He's in the backyard right now.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.800
The brother who's calling
is saying that the brother
may turn the gun on himself

07:32.833 --> 07:34.433
when confronted.

07:45.333 --> 07:49.733
So right now, it looks like
the guy went back inside
the house, and we're gonna call

07:49.767 --> 07:53.067
one of our hostage negotiators
to come up, who's actually
working right now,

07:53.100 --> 07:55.400
to see if he can
talk to him and get him
on the phone somehow.

07:57.733 --> 08:02.800
And we're calling our BearCat,
which is our armored vehicle
up here, to use as a position,

08:02.833 --> 08:05.800
to make, uh, PA announcements
to get him out of the house,

08:05.833 --> 08:10.433
and also for a position of cover
in case he starts shooting
at us as well.

08:10.467 --> 08:13.267
He's only made threats
against himself, and he's
not actually threatened

08:13.300 --> 08:14.633
anyone else.

08:14.667 --> 08:18.233
So it's just gonna be
a suicidal subject right now

08:18.267 --> 08:20.467
as far as we can discern,
until we can actually
talk to him,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.167
see what's going on.

08:25.667 --> 08:29.067
-(siren blaring)

08:30.967 --> 08:34.433
-(over PA):
(indistinct)..., come out
to the front yard, please.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.833
-(speaking in Spanish)

08:41.067 --> 08:42.300
-Door's opening.
-The door's opening.

08:42.333 --> 08:45.700
That's him.
-Back up towards the sound
of my voice!

08:45.733 --> 08:48.900
-Back up, back up. Okay.
-We got company, okay?

08:48.933 --> 08:52.267
Stop.
Get down on your knees.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.767
Get down on your knees!

08:53.800 --> 08:57.933
-Keep your hands up!
-Lay down on the ground
in front of you.

08:59.367 --> 09:03.600
Hands out to your side.
Hands out to your side.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.967
Straight out to your side!

09:06.067 --> 09:08.833
-(indistinct conversation)

09:08.867 --> 09:10.900
-So where is the gun?

09:15.067 --> 09:17.733
-All right.
So right now we've got
one subject in custody,

09:17.767 --> 09:20.400
so we're talking to him
right now to see what, uh,
the deal is.

09:20.433 --> 09:23.733
And also try to locate
this gun, who, uh,
his family members

09:23.767 --> 09:27.267
have said that he's always
carrying it on him,
or he leaves it in his room.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.333
-(dog barking)
-It's not illegal
to own a gun.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.300
-Yeah, I know.
-But I don't want you
to kill yourself.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.133
-I know, and I don't
want to either.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.667
I'm telling you right now,
I don't have nothing--
-I don't want these kids

09:35.700 --> 09:38.533
that live here to find that gun.
-Yeah, they won't.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.133
-'Cause there's nothing here.

09:40.167 --> 09:42.767
-I know there's nothing
right here. I completely
agree with that.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.833
-There's nothing anywhere here.
You can check the whole house.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.567
-Let's go inside your room
right now.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.833
-I really gave--
gave the gun to my friend.

09:49.867 --> 09:53.200
-So we started to, uh,
search this RV, the door
was open.

09:53.233 --> 09:57.067
This is where we found
a small, uh, like a compact
Luger handgun

09:57.067 --> 09:59.600
with the magazine
right below it.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.133
See, right there.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.267
It was, uh,
outside of the gun.

10:05.900 --> 10:11.567
We also found a larger
magazine... on, uh, on top
of the roof over there.

10:13.367 --> 10:17.233
-Do I look like an idiot?
-No.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.867
-Because the dog's not even
here yet, and we already found
the other bullets.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.133
On the roof, where you were.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.067
Why are you lying to me?

10:27.100 --> 10:29.500
-I'm not lying.
-I can't be any nicer
to you, can I?

10:31.633 --> 10:34.633
Only way I could be nicer
is if I took you out
to dinner right now.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.233
Am I right?
-Yeah.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.133
-I've been nothing but cool
with you.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.933
-I'm being honest with you,
I gave it to my friend.

10:40.967 --> 10:42.500
I gave it to my friend,
he just gave it away.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.767
-I don't want you
to lie to me again.
-I'm not lying to you, sir.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.367
What he did with that
I have no clue.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.500
-That's the 18th lie
you told me now.
-I'm being honest with you.

10:48.533 --> 10:51.333
-I counted 'em.
-You already-- I'm not even
trying to lie to you,

10:51.367 --> 10:53.333
because...
-So when I walk over--
So when I walk over

10:53.367 --> 10:57.667
to that van over there,
and I find a gun in that van...

10:57.700 --> 10:59.500
you're gonna still be
telling me the truth?

10:59.533 --> 11:01.967
-I ain't put it--
I ain't put nothing there.
-Is your fingerprints

11:02.067 --> 11:04.567
and DNA gonna be on it?
-Most likely, yeah.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.500
But so-- so is my friend's.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.400
-I'm not worried
about your friends.
I'm worried about you

11:08.433 --> 11:10.167
being a man right now,
and telling me the truth.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.967
-I'm being a man, yes.
I had-- I had a gun
and I gave it to my friend.

11:15.233 --> 11:17.900
-All right, I'm done with you.

11:17.933 --> 11:19.300
-So Sam?

11:20.900 --> 11:25.067
-That lady's not here.
See? She knows.
That it's hers.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.467
-It's her gun?
-Well, one of her friends.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.133
-All right, so first
it was her gun, now
it's her friend's gun.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.400
Whose gun is it?

11:32.433 --> 11:34.733
-Supposedly it's some guy
who came from San Francisco.

11:34.767 --> 11:37.833
-Okay, so now it's a guy's--
it's a guy's gun.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.367
Do you see where
we keep going with this,

11:39.400 --> 11:40.633
how we're running
into issues?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.333
-You could ask my mom.
-Okay.

11:43.533 --> 11:48.600
-(speaking Spanish)

11:50.133 --> 11:51.267
-All right.

11:54.233 --> 11:56.567
All right, Sam,
how'd this all start today?

11:56.600 --> 11:58.633
With you and--
Who were you arguing with?

11:58.667 --> 12:01.200
What happened?
-My mom was just
arguing with me

12:01.233 --> 12:03.233
because I had to come--
I had three friends

12:03.267 --> 12:05.167
over for my birthday.
-Okay.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.367
And, um, she just didn't
want anybody here.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.967
That was it.

12:11.067 --> 12:14.467
She kicked everyone out,
and then I was just a little...

12:15.833 --> 12:18.167
Okay.
So where did the gun
come into play with that?

12:19.900 --> 12:21.800
-Well, the gun had nothing
to do with it, she's just--

12:21.833 --> 12:23.800
she's been telling me
to get rid of it.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.867
She just-- That's, like,
the reason why she wants
to kick me out.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.567
'Cause I've had it.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.367
-Well, we got a call
saying you were threatening
to kill yourself with a gun.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.100
That's what
my mom said, but...

12:35.133 --> 12:37.067
-Did you threaten
to kill yourself?

12:37.067 --> 12:38.800
No? Do you wanna kill yourself?

12:38.833 --> 12:40.967
-No.
-Do you wanna hurt anyone else?

12:41.067 --> 12:44.433
-I don't.
I don't, and that's why
I'm giving it to you guys.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.933
-Well, right now
you're being detained,
all right?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.533
You're gonna go
to the hospital
for an evaluation

12:48.567 --> 12:50.300
at the very least,
all right?
-Yeah, that's what the--

12:50.333 --> 12:51.600
That's what the, um,
officer told me.

12:51.633 --> 12:53.567
-And we're gonna talk
to the district attorney

12:53.600 --> 12:55.100
and see what they wanna do
with the gun, okay?

12:55.133 --> 12:57.100
But we'll see what
we can do for you.
-All right.

12:57.133 --> 12:59.133
-All right, we appreciate
you coming clean with it,
all right?

12:59.167 --> 13:01.100
-He promised me, though,
that I wouldn't be--
-No, I know.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.233
I know.
But everything gets--
everything with guns

13:03.267 --> 13:06.067
gets documented,
and we can do our--
we can do what we can do

13:06.067 --> 13:08.067
to help you out,
all right?

13:10.300 --> 13:12.467
Happy Birthday, by the way.
-Thank you, sir.

13:15.767 --> 13:18.067
-I've been in law enforcement
coming up on 16 years.

13:18.067 --> 13:22.100
Um, with a diverse community,
you have a huge array
of problems

13:22.133 --> 13:23.767
that people have.
One of our main jobs

13:23.800 --> 13:27.233
is to help people
manage their life for the next
24 to 48 hours.

13:27.267 --> 13:29.833
Um, we can't fix everyone's
problems, but at least
if we can give them

13:29.867 --> 13:31.700
that little-- put 'em
in the right direction

13:31.733 --> 13:34.467
to help get 'em goin'
and-- and get 'em out
of a bad situation,

13:34.500 --> 13:37.333
then that's-- that's usually
a good day.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.467
Uh, responding
to a domestic disturbance.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.967
Uh, both parties
are intoxicated.

13:42.067 --> 13:47.233
Uh, pretty much we've been
to this house, looks like
about seven times this month

13:47.267 --> 13:50.267
so far, actually in the last
14 days.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.900
One's making an allegation
of battery, and then the other
making an allegation

13:53.933 --> 13:55.800
of, uh, criminal mischief
to a vehicle,

13:55.833 --> 13:58.667
so we'll see what's happened
with 'em this time.

14:05.433 --> 14:06.667
Hello.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.400
What's going on tonight?

14:09.433 --> 14:10.500
-Well...

14:12.133 --> 14:16.833
Uh, I was on my way home
today, and-- well, anyway,

14:16.867 --> 14:20.100
I got home and, um,
we were gonna buy somethin'
to eat, going to Walmart

14:20.133 --> 14:22.767
to buy some food,
and I went to, uh, Walmart--

14:22.800 --> 14:26.367
and me and my girlfriend
have been having a few arguments
lately, and I said,

14:26.400 --> 14:30.967
"Just please, just for today,
let's not argue, I don't
wanna fight with you today."

14:31.067 --> 14:32.500
That's all I asked her.

14:32.533 --> 14:35.067
And then she makes a comment
about my-- my wife died
two years ago.

14:35.067 --> 14:37.300
My wife died
of alcoholic hepatitis.
She always says

14:37.333 --> 14:39.867
that I'm the one-- I'm
the reason she drank herself
to death.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.467
So then she makes a comment
about my-- my deceased wife.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.667
We get in an argument
and she starts beatin'--
beating the fricking top

14:45.700 --> 14:48.567
of the roof.
She broke the windshield,
and then she frickin'

14:48.600 --> 14:52.267
takes the heel of her hand,
hits me in my jaw, grabs me
by my neck,

14:52.300 --> 14:55.667
like she's fricking gonna,
you know, like, strangle me,
while I'm fricking driving,

14:55.700 --> 14:58.133
and I was like, goddammit,
I-- we-- we came back
to the house,

14:58.167 --> 15:00.667
and I said, "You know what?
I don't-- You know what?"
I didn't even wanna--

15:00.700 --> 15:03.500
I could've called the cops
right then, I said, "You know
what, Missy? I could have you

15:03.533 --> 15:05.200
put in jail right now
for assault," I said,

15:05.233 --> 15:07.633
"But I'm gonna give you--
Just-- Just leave and I'm
not gonna call the cops."

15:07.667 --> 15:10.100
And then she immediately
gets on the phone
and calls 9-1-1.

15:10.133 --> 15:14.667
-Okay.
So, what's she gonna tell me
when I go in there?

15:14.700 --> 15:17.067
What do you-- What--
Has she been saying anything
to you about,

15:17.067 --> 15:19.267
"I'm gonna tell 'em this," or--
I'm-- I mean, obviously--

15:19.300 --> 15:21.500
-She tells him that,
"Oh, I'm gonna tell them
that you were pointin'

15:21.533 --> 15:23.700
the fricking shotgun at me
and yadda, yadda, yadda,"
and I'm like--

15:23.733 --> 15:25.067
-Do you have any injuries?

15:25.100 --> 15:26.867
-I have this on my neck,
that's all,

15:26.900 --> 15:28.533
where she frickin'
grabbed me by my neck.

15:28.567 --> 15:29.700
-Let me see.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.067
Okay.
-Is she inside still?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.833
-Yeah.
-She's inside.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.833
-All right, well, I'm gonna
go in and talk to her
real quick.

15:37.867 --> 15:40.433
This deputy's gonna
stay out here with you.
Be right back.

15:40.467 --> 15:42.367
-Ma'am?
-Yeah.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
-Just talk to me for a minute.
What's going on?

15:44.233 --> 15:45.800
-Man: Shut the door.
-Please.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.933
I'm leavin'. Okay?
I'm leavin'.

15:48.967 --> 15:51.767
This has been going on
non-stop, he's--

15:51.800 --> 15:56.233
He has a substance abuse
problem. He's goin'
to Sober Solutions,

15:56.267 --> 15:59.500
He didn't go all week this week.
I'm leaving.

15:59.533 --> 16:03.833
I've made arrangements
to fly-- I'm on disability,

16:03.867 --> 16:05.600
I get paid on the third.
-Okay.

16:05.633 --> 16:11.367
-Okay. On the third,
I'm catching a flight
to Kentucky.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.600
I'm done.
-Okay.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.533
-Okay.
-So what happened tonight?

16:14.567 --> 16:18.767
-No one's hitting anyone,
no one's trying
to get anyone hurt.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.933
-What--
-He's already saying that
you hit him in the face

16:20.967 --> 16:23.133
and that you caused
that scratch on his neck.

16:23.167 --> 16:26.767
-Okay, well, you know what?
I can come clean
about everything

16:26.800 --> 16:28.900
that's gone on this week
and about the gun that--

16:28.933 --> 16:30.733
the loaded shotgun
that I've had in my face,

16:30.767 --> 16:32.600
but I'm not gonna do that.

16:32.633 --> 16:34.467
-But you just did.
-Right.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.967
-Yeah.
So, he's out there
telling me that you left marks

16:38.067 --> 16:40.933
on him, you hit him,
you broke his windshield,
and now you're--

16:40.967 --> 16:42.500
-And I'm admitting
to what I did.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.267
-Okay.
-I broke the windshield,
and I--

16:44.300 --> 16:46.067
-So let's get
the rest of the story out.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.567
How did you end up
with your neck all red

16:47.600 --> 16:50.100
and a mark over the top
of your eye?

16:53.633 --> 16:57.667
-Because he can't
leave me alone.
-Okay.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.400
-He won't leave me alone.
-All right.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.900
-I just want to be alone.
-Can you just have a seat
here for me while I go

17:01.933 --> 17:04.500
talk to my partner out there
and see what's goin' on?

17:04.533 --> 17:06.767
Thank you.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.500
She says it was physical.
She admits to breakin'
the window.

17:09.533 --> 17:11.467
It's his car.
She admits
to breaking the window.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.967
But-- And she won't deny
that she left the mark on him.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.367
-But she's not saying
that he--
-She will not come off

17:17.400 --> 17:19.267
that he did anything.
She's got a scratch
over her eye,

17:19.300 --> 17:21.067
and her neck's red,
but she's, like, no.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.367
I'm like, I asked her
three times, so...

17:23.400 --> 17:24.600
she's gonna go
for domestic battery.

17:24.633 --> 17:26.067
-All right.
Let me go get
written statements

17:26.100 --> 17:27.200
and I'll come--
-All right.

17:27.233 --> 17:28.667
-Are you doing 10-15 now,
or do you want her

17:28.700 --> 17:30.367
to do a written statement?
-I'm gonna ask her

17:30.400 --> 17:32.200
if she'll do one, I don't think
she will, so...

17:32.233 --> 17:33.633
All right. I'll be right back.
-All right.

17:34.867 --> 17:36.300
Ma'am?
-Yeah?

17:36.333 --> 17:39.467
-Do you wanna do
a written statement
about what happened tonight?

17:39.500 --> 17:44.100
-I just want to be left alone.
Can you take me to a shelter

17:44.133 --> 17:46.200
or something?
Can you guys do that?

17:46.233 --> 17:47.800
-Um, just hold on for me
for one minute.

17:47.833 --> 17:51.067
In Florida, when there's
an alleged domestic battery
with injuries,

17:51.100 --> 17:53.367
somebody
gets arrested. Okay?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.167
He's got marks on him,
you've admitted to breaking
the windshield,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.367
you're refusing to tell me
what happened to you,
you're admitting

17:58.400 --> 18:00.133
to a physical altercation.
-You're gonna arrest me.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.633
-You're under arrest
for domestic battery,

18:01.667 --> 18:03.467
so if you can go ahead
and stand up for me.

18:07.900 --> 18:11.400
-Little... lying ass--
-He's has nothing to do with it.

18:11.433 --> 18:13.067
-Yeah, he has everything
to do with it.

18:13.067 --> 18:16.367
-Well, he has nothing
to do with the decision
of you getting arrested.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.800
-Like I said--
-Why? Because I lied
and covered for him

18:18.833 --> 18:21.467
for the last--
since September?

18:22.767 --> 18:28.533
What the (bleep)?
(crying) Why?

18:32.467 --> 18:35.167
He's a (bleep).

18:35.200 --> 18:38.433
(sobbing)

18:38.467 --> 18:40.567
-All right, go ahead
and have a seat for me.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.400
-(sobbing)

18:46.100 --> 18:49.333
(sobbing loudly)

18:49.367 --> 18:52.900
He hit me and I'm the one
who's going to jail?

18:57.333 --> 18:58.800
-There will be
a No Contact order

18:58.833 --> 19:01.300
because it is domestic,
so she won't be able
to come back here

19:01.333 --> 19:03.433
without one of us
to do-- collect clothing
and such,

19:03.467 --> 19:05.267
she'll be able to come
get some clothing
and everything,

19:05.300 --> 19:06.600
and be able to leave.

19:06.633 --> 19:08.633
So, if she calls you,
contacts you or anything
like that,

19:08.667 --> 19:11.067
she'll be in violation
of that order and then
she'll go back to jail.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.300
-Okay.
-Okay. Do you have
any questions?

19:12.333 --> 19:13.567
-No, sir.
-All right.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.333
-All right, well,
thank you very much.
-Yes.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.900
Hey, Melissa.
-Yeah.

19:20.933 --> 19:23.333
-Look, all right,
first off, I want you
to understand

19:23.367 --> 19:25.267
that he didn't decide
to have you arrested.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.233
The law says
when there's domestic battery,

19:27.267 --> 19:31.067
we make an arrest.
When he shows me injuries
and says yes, she did it,

19:31.067 --> 19:33.100
and you still continued
to cover for him--

19:33.133 --> 19:34.500
-That's because I'm an idiot.

19:34.533 --> 19:36.833
I don't ever wanna
see his face again.

19:36.867 --> 19:39.467
-Okay.
-I want--
I want him gone.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.967
-All right.
-Completely.
Ever, forever.

19:42.067 --> 19:44.067
-That sounds like
probably the best thing
for your relationship.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.367
-Gone. Gone.
-When things turn physical,
it usually never gets better.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.833
Cover is code three.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.833
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.667 --> 20:06.300
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.167
-(theme music playing)
