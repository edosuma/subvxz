13:04.483 --> 13:07.884

a little hard-core for an art dealer.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.004

13:36.081 --> 13:39.847
Trouble started over a painting
called Ladyin White.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.855
Bids of, like, five, seven million
were coming in before he even finished it.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.289
My dad's health was failing.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.883
But Chandlerjust kept
pressuring him to finish it.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.452
Dad got sick ofit,
said that hewas gonna get a new dealer.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.464
Ooh, that probably
stung Chandler pretty good.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.558

that's a lot of money.

my dad's loft, beat him to death...

14:01.941 --> 14:04.876

14:04.944 --> 14:07.242
Ladyin White was reported destroyed.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.474
Cops called it a burglary gone bad.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.589

When I heard that Ladyin White
was being moved on the black market...

14:28.601 --> 14:31.001
I came down and got a job with Chandler.

I gotta prove that Chandler's involved.
His security's good.

I thought that I would get him
with that key logger thing.

To make a magnetpowerful enough...

15:49.078 --> 15:52.377

26:04.559 --> 26:06.823
the difference between a spy

is that a thiefgets to take
what he wants and run.

to the scene ofthe crime the next day...

don't always hide things
where they have the easiest access.

gets a little more subtle.

- Sam, how'd it go with Orr?
- [ On Phone ] He'll be there anyminute.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.158
You betterget outta there, Mike.

35:46.804 --> 35:48.738
What are you doing here?

35:48.806 --> 35:52.742
[Michael Narrating] One ofthe problems
with running a criminal conspiracy...

35:52.810 --> 35:56.246
is that there's no real way
to avoid trust issues with your coworkers.

35:56.314 --> 35:59.010
- Where's the pai nti ng?
- He-He took it.

35:59.083 --> 36:01.313
- Yeah? Who took it?
- The spy!

36:01.386 --> 36:03.911
He was here and he took it.
Then he... hit me.

36:03.988 --> 36:06.957
Ifyou steal with a guy, he knowsyou're a thief.

36:07.025 --> 36:10.085
The spy? The spy took it?

36:10.161 --> 36:12.220
[ Laughs ]

36:12.297 --> 36:15.266
You rip me off. You try to kill me.

36:15.333 --> 36:18.097
- And you can't come up with
anything better than that?
- No, I swear to God.

36:18.169 --> 36:21.468
- Please, I swear to you.
- Ifyou kill with him, he knowsyou're a killer.

36:21.539 --> 36:24.064
Last chance. Where is it?

36:24.142 --> 36:27.703
No, the spy, he took it!
The spy! The spy took it!

36:27.779 --> 36:29.713
[ Gunshot ]

36:29.781 --> 36:32.249
[Michael Narrating]
It's a serious management issue.

36:34.118 --> 36:36.882
Well, you don't have to worry about Chandler
anymore. His partner just got arrested...

36:36.955 --> 36:39.116
trying to dump his body in the Miami River.

36:39.190 --> 36:41.658
I really don't know how to thankyou guys.

36:41.726 --> 36:45.059
I... brought some cash.

36:46.197 --> 36:48.222
Uh, Melanie...

36:48.299 --> 36:50.426
I'm pretty sureyou just lostyourjob, so--

36:50.501 --> 36:53.231
My dad left most ofhis estate to an art school.

36:53.304 --> 36:56.296
But he left me a little bit.

36:56.374 --> 36:58.069
Trust me. It's cool.

36:58.142 --> 37:00.508
- Oh. Thankyou.
- And I'm not sure...

37:00.578 --> 37:02.443
ifyou're really into this sort ofthing...

37:02.513 --> 37:06.847
but my dad painted this theyear I was born.

37:06.918 --> 37:09.682
It's always been one of my favorites.
I wantyou to have it.

37:11.022 --> 37:12.990
Thankyou.

37:15.860 --> 37:18.454
- [ Sighs ] Thanks again.
- Take care.

37:20.698 --> 37:23.496
[ Sighs ]
Do me a favor. Drop this off at the loft.

37:23.568 --> 37:26.833
I have to go kidnap an explosives expert.

37:26.904 --> 37:28.895
Good luckwith that.

37:32.477 --> 37:36.311
The shotguns you requested.
Modified 'em myself.

37:38.249 --> 37:41.446
Now, you sure you don't want me to come
up there, helpyou guys out, backyou up?

37:41.519 --> 37:43.578
We're fine, Seymour.

37:43.655 --> 37:46.180
Godspeed. Uh, those are--

37:46.257 --> 37:49.124
They're loaded with the shells...

37:49.193 --> 37:52.356
that I made specifically for this job.

37:56.434 --> 37:59.801
[MaleAnnouncerOn TV]
Gives him a big right hand!
Oh!Anotherbig right hand!

38:04.976 --> 38:08.309
[Michael Narrating]
Favored by bomb squads, disrupter shells...

38:08.379 --> 38:12.213
are a specially-designed
shotgun round filled with water.

38:12.283 --> 38:17.619
The blast can blow an explosive
device apart without igniting it.

38:17.689 --> 38:20.886
The shells are only lethal
up to about six feet.

38:20.958 --> 38:23.188
At 1 0 feet, theyjust hurt a lot.

38:23.261 --> 38:24.660
[ Groans ]

38:32.904 --> 38:37.603
- Recognize me?
- Yeah. You're the guy that
lives over the club. Listen.

38:37.675 --> 38:39.905
I-I work for hire.
It was nothing personal.

38:41.779 --> 38:46.182
You wantsome ofthis? Huh?
'Cause I made itspecial,just foryou.

38:46.250 --> 38:49.185
Seymour, I don't thinkwe need that.
What do you say, Derek?

38:49.253 --> 38:51.118
No.

38:53.358 --> 38:56.691
Answer my questions, and I'll get you
and your girlfriend out ofthe country. Deal?

38:56.761 --> 38:59.855
- All right.
- Who hired you to kill me?

38:59.931 --> 39:02.024
- I don't know.
- Okay. Mike, look.

39:02.100 --> 39:05.365
I knowyou're the professional here,
but I really think a little--

39:05.436 --> 39:09.566
Listen, I-I never met the guy before.
He just gave meyour address and I did the job.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.665
How did they payyou?

39:13.378 --> 39:16.142
Transferred a hundred grand
to an account in the Caymans.

39:16.214 --> 39:18.273
- You have the account number?
- Yeah.

39:18.349 --> 39:20.874
Seven-five-nine--

39:20.952 --> 39:24.080
[Michael]
Seven-five-nine--

39:24.155 --> 39:25.747
Seven-five-nine--

39:25.823 --> 39:26.983
five-one-six--

39:27.058 --> 39:29.424
Hold on. Go ahead.

39:29.494 --> 39:33.225
- Five-one-six--
- Five-one-six--

39:35.533 --> 39:37.262
three-double zero-three.

39:37.335 --> 39:39.303
three-zero-zero-three.

39:39.370 --> 39:41.736
He-He had me memorize it.
[Laughing]

39:41.806 --> 39:43.467
That-That's all I know.

39:43.541 --> 39:46.942
Seymour, you have any,
uh, gun shipments heading out to Suriname?

39:47.011 --> 39:49.479
Suriname. Every otherweek.

39:50.648 --> 39:53.014
Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait-- Suriname?

39:53.084 --> 39:55.951
- Come on, man!
- Out ofthe country. Deal's a deal.

39:56.020 --> 39:59.649
- It's a beautiful place.
- I don't even know where that is!

40:02.059 --> 40:03.993
- That was quick.
- I got the account number...

40:04.061 --> 40:06.086
used by the man who hired Poole to kill me.

40:06.164 --> 40:09.156
- I just need to turn it into a name.
- Hey. I'm sorry.

40:09.233 --> 40:14.034
I almost forgot. Here.

40:14.105 --> 40:16.164
It's a little--

40:16.240 --> 40:19.300
It's a little something I had made for, uh--

40:19.377 --> 40:23.108
Well, it's in honor of
our first operation together.

40:23.181 --> 40:24.842
Go on. Open 'em.

40:27.318 --> 40:29.843
Oh!

40:29.921 --> 40:31.855
Matching throwing daggers.

40:31.923 --> 40:35.882
That's... very thoughtful ofyou, Seymour.

40:35.960 --> 40:39.828
And ifyou look at the engraving there,
it means destiny.

40:43.468 --> 40:45.902
It's a symbol ofyour bond.

40:47.004 --> 40:49.973
Of-Of our bond, actually.

40:50.041 --> 40:52.236
I made one for myselftoo.

40:55.713 --> 40:58.511
Oh. I'd better get back. You know, uh...

40:58.583 --> 41:02.212
don't wanna leave Jackass
alone too long with the captive.

41:06.724 --> 41:09.716
[ Fiona ]
That was kind of sweet.

41:11.262 --> 41:14.231
You know, the morning afterwe, uh--

41:14.298 --> 41:16.391
Yeah.

41:16.467 --> 41:19.959
I broughtyou a Spanish omelet,
egg white only.

41:20.037 --> 41:22.198
Butyou were gone.

41:22.273 --> 41:24.264
My favorite.

41:25.943 --> 41:28.741
Maybe next time, I'll have to stay.
