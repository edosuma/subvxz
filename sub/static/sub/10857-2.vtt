WEBVTT

00:02.072 --> 00:03.777
Anomalies are starting to appear.

00:03.812 --> 00:08.254
Doorways on time to worlds we
can barely imagine.

00:08.289 --> 00:12.069
The anomalies are conclusive prooves
that the past exists.

00:12.104 --> 00:16.358
The farest dimension is real and solid
as those we already know.

00:16.393 --> 00:19.204
Our job is to predict and contain.

00:22.068 --> 00:24.978
Under the circumstances
I'm going to allow your exploratory mission into the anomaly.

00:25.013 --> 00:27.683
People, somebody's been here before us.

00:27.718 --> 00:29.397
Whatever it was it didn't get far.

00:29.432 --> 00:30.996
It's H.C. It's Hellen Cutter.

00:31.036 --> 00:33.500
Helen Cutter came to this area
eight years ago.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.578
She disappeared in the forest, her body was
never found.

00:35.606 --> 00:36.741
Helen!

00:37.794 --> 00:38.549
I'd lost her.

00:40.099 --> 00:42.053
And now I think she's back from the dead.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

02:09.118 --> 02:10.130
It's called it anomalies.

02:10.175 --> 02:13.040
But I can't say anymore, official secrets act.

02:13.086 --> 02:17.022
But I will tell you this.
I've seen a gorgonopsid.

02:17.055 --> 02:20.273
Face to face and trust me
it's not pretty.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.951
Just how stupid do you
think we are, Connor?

02:22.998 --> 02:24.890
But it's all true.

02:26.637 --> 02:31.633
Alright, I swear on my Empire Strikes Back
first edition poster signed by Luke Skywalker and David Prowse.

02:31.678 --> 02:34.450
Careful, that is evoking a sacred relic.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.631
Yeah, or the Bible.

02:35.678 --> 02:37.053
I know what a sacred relic is Duncan

02:37.097 --> 02:38.621
I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.

02:38.658 --> 02:43.080
Space/time anomalies and dinosaurs,
sounds like someone's been overdoing the playstation.

02:43.116 --> 02:44.073
I can prove it.

02:45.547 --> 02:46.633
Alright I'm not allowed to.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.530
Right.

02:47.566 --> 02:50.243
Y'know one day you gonna gutted that
you don't believe me.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.691
- He's lost it.
- Totally.

02:53.735 --> 02:56.641
That's the saddest thing I've seen
since Matrix Revolutions.

02:56.686 --> 03:00.942
What's weird is he actually
seems to be believe it.

03:12.745 --> 03:14.192
There's ten years of Helen's
work here.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.113
Keep looking.

03:16.155 --> 03:19.113
You've read every word
she ever wrote.

03:19.145 --> 03:23.643
Yes, but we did know about the anomaly
then, there may be references to it...

03:23.676 --> 03:25.300
in Helen's work that we overlooked.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.860
If she knew about it,
she'd have told you.

03:32.928 --> 03:33.770
Hello?

03:35.956 --> 03:36.700
Helen!

03:38.676 --> 03:40.030
You alright?

03:43.286 --> 03:44.931
Just haven't been sleeping very well.

04:05.307 --> 04:06.993
Hi Fred.

04:19.028 --> 04:20.331
Abby, open up!

04:20.367 --> 04:22.101
I think I found another anomaly.

04:22.147 --> 04:23.500
Three secs.

04:32.086 --> 04:35.611
Hi. Woa!

04:35.656 --> 04:37.362
Come in.

04:42.516 --> 04:47.440
This place is supercool.
I mean is it... woa!

04:48.918 --> 04:50.833
Is it me or is really hot in here?

04:50.875 --> 04:53.801
Ow! I'll get changed.

04:53.847 --> 04:55.183
You should read this.

04:58.888 --> 04:59.813
Where did you get this?

04:59.847 --> 05:02.270
Internet, on a web sightings forum.

05:02.316 --> 05:04.653
It looks to me like another
anomaly, we should check it out.

05:04.688 --> 05:06.053
What did Cutter say?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.233
I haven't actually told him yet.

05:08.276 --> 05:11.173
I could be wrong and I don't want him to think I'm an idiot.

05:11.216 --> 05:12.980
He already thinks you are an idiot.

05:13.027 --> 05:14.522
Thanks very much.

05:14.555 --> 05:17.452
Come on, think how impressed
he'll be if I'm right.

05:17.495 --> 05:19.571
I still think you should tell him.

05:22.168 --> 05:23.243
Rex.

05:25.007 --> 05:27.003
Ow, he came back.

05:29.557 --> 05:30.953
Kidnapping helpless lizards?

05:30.988 --> 05:33.913
I didn't want those people getting
ahold of him again.

05:35.607 --> 05:37.660
That explains why you're keeping
the place so hot.

05:37.708 --> 05:40.811
- You're gonna tell anyone?
- No, I mean, you can rely on me.

05:43.025 --> 05:44.320
So how about it, you're in?

05:49.856 --> 05:51.993
Maybe we should just let
someone know.

05:52.025 --> 05:54.263
Come  on, this is our chance
to show 'em we're useful.

05:54.298 --> 05:56.861
Come on Abby, we're pals now right?

05:58.228 --> 05:59.183
Right?

05:59.928 --> 06:03.061
You never know we could find a
new lil' playmate for Rex.

06:03.108 --> 06:07.042
They could get together and talk
about really old times.

06:51.105 --> 06:52.991
The Forest of Dean is completly clear.

06:53.035 --> 06:54.491
I've left Ryan in charge of
mapping up.

06:54.528 --> 06:58.192
There's been a lot of internet chatter
but we've got natural disbelief on our side.

06:58.238 --> 06:59.243
Eye witnesses?

06:59.276 --> 07:03.621
The school teacher is in shock,
but we can keep her away from the papers and the boy will be no problem.

07:03.667 --> 07:04.662
Thank you.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.702
Bit of a monster, didn't it **?

07:06.746 --> 07:08.772
That wouldn't be the neatest solution.

07:10.127 --> 07:10.510
Joke.

07:11.878 --> 07:13.763
- What about Cutter?
- What about him?

07:13.806 --> 07:17.282
I don't like anyone to whom the adjective maverick
might be applied.

07:17.327 --> 07:19.531
Cutter virtually owns the copyright.

07:19.575 --> 07:23.503
He may be a little unconventional in
his methods but he's the closest thing we got to an expert.

07:23.547 --> 07:25.642
You've taken to him, haven't you?

07:27.398 --> 07:29.553
I trust him, if that's what you mean.

07:29.596 --> 07:32.613
Of course, what else?

07:34.538 --> 07:36.483
Very well, we'll keep him
on site from the time being.

07:36.525 --> 07:39.012
I'd rather have him inside
the proverbial tent than outside.

07:47.636 --> 07:49.532
Maybe this wasn't such a great idea.

07:51.098 --> 07:52.590
You can hold my hand if you're frightened.

07:53.517 --> 07:55.713
And how's that gonna make
me feel better?

07:57.987 --> 07:59.690
I just don't think we should
be doing it on our own.

08:00.637 --> 08:04.340
Stop worrying. If there's another
gorgonopsid then just run like hell.

08:04.387 --> 08:05.571
Shut up, Connor.

08:05.608 --> 08:07.042
I was just saying.

08:38.865 --> 08:40.323
You haven't replied to any
of my messages.

08:41.235 --> 08:42.260
So I came in person.

08:44.496 --> 08:46.990
You know, I've been going through Helen's papers, please.

08:52.665 --> 08:55.183
It was my fault that she disappeared.

08:55.228 --> 08:56.691
Why?

08:56.738 --> 08:59.902
I was supposed to go with her on that
last field trip but...

09:01.257 --> 09:04.250
we had a row, another row.

09:05.235 --> 09:11.522
She'd become obsessed with theories
that I found... ridiculous.

09:11.568 --> 09:13.031
You mean she was onto
the anomaly?

09:13.065 --> 09:17.931
No, not as such but, she'd become
convinced that there was no conventional scientific...

09:17.968 --> 09:23.161
answers to certain evolutionary puzzles and
obviously she was right.

09:23.206 --> 09:24.922
Nobody could have guessed that.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.231
Yes but she did.

09:28.518 --> 09:30.190
You are not to blame for her death, you know?

09:33.108 --> 09:34.700
What makes you so sure she's dead?

09:36.158 --> 09:38.423
She was lost 2 hundred million years
away in the past.

09:38.465 --> 09:40.003
What else could she be?

09:44.738 --> 09:46.132
My tent is only big enough for one.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.342
Should have brought your own.

09:48.357 --> 09:49.623
I like sleeping out.

09:51.617 --> 09:52.523
Don't really look the type.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.390
I *** a while, you know.

09:56.558 --> 10:00.291
For morning. Till I sprayed my ankle.

10:05.097 --> 10:07.860
Oh, freezing.

10:11.046 --> 10:12.891
We should huggle together for warmth.

10:15.986 --> 10:16.592
Or not.

10:24.855 --> 10:26.132
Can I ask you a personal question? 

10:30.235 --> 10:31.743
Go ahead, anything.

10:33.687 --> 10:35.573
Is Stephen seeing anybody?

10:35.616 --> 10:38.811
- Stephen?
- Has he said anything about me?

10:40.587 --> 10:44.911
Uh, no, not that I can remember.
No.

10:52.747 --> 10:57.401
Actually I've never seen him with a woman.
He might not like 'em.

10:59.945 --> 11:02.151
- Could be gay.
- He's gay?

11:03.105 --> 11:04.930
I never said he was, I just
said he could be.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.322
But you don't know.

11:07.487 --> 11:08.800
Not conclusively.

11:11.485 --> 11:12.101
N o.

11:22.387 --> 11:24.963
I'll  keep first watch then, ***.

11:31.797 --> 11:34.913
- So tell me the plan.
- What plan? What else can we do?

11:34.958 --> 11:38.893
Well, we could start off by telling
everyone the truth.

11:38.935 --> 11:41.141
- No.
- Why?

11:41.185 --> 11:44.720
Right now this is just a rumour mill
for internet conspiracy freaks.

11:44.753 --> 11:46.088
And we can contain that.

11:46.116 --> 11:52.261
The alternatives are panic, histeria,
potential lawlessness, simply unviable.

11:52.304 --> 11:55.689
A cover up. Connor will
be thrilled.

11:55.719 --> 11:57.350
It's not a cover up.

11:57.385 --> 12:00.871
Well, this case is
but we have to do it.

12:00.906 --> 12:03.171
Text from Abby, Connor thinks
she's on to another anomaly.

12:03.215 --> 12:04.520
They've gone to investigate.

12:04.568 --> 12:05.970
Where, where are they?

12:06.016 --> 12:09.111
New forest, she's not exactly sure where.

13:05.256 --> 13:06.910
- Connor, wake up!
- What?

13:08.926 --> 13:12.430
Oh my God!
Quick!

13:35.585 --> 13:39.151
- Careful it bites!
- You idiots.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.562
- Look, I know what you're gonna say.
- We're sorry.

14:36.606 --> 14:39.120
Police aren't gonna prosecute
you for trespassing.

14:39.166 --> 14:44.030
Suppose that had been a predator,
what were you gonna do? ** it?

14:44.077 --> 14:48.420
You knew exactly what was at stake
but you just couldn't keep your mouth shut.

14:49.778 --> 14:53.333
It's so big, I had to tell somebody.

14:55.737 --> 14:59.530
Sorry, I am, I blew it.

15:00.796 --> 15:04.421
Go back to college, get on with your work,
I'll find you another supervisor.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.131
I'm just as much to blame as he is.

15:06.165 --> 15:07.651
Just as stupid maybe.

15:07.688 --> 15:11.412
But you did shut your mouth off and you still have skills
I can use, you stay.

15:37.658 --> 15:39.541
This kind of thing doesn't normally interest the government.

15:39.588 --> 15:43.640
We like to keep an eye on violent
crime Dr. Lewis, especially when there's unusual circumstances.

15:43.675 --> 15:45.772
Well, he was found out this
morning in the underground.

15:45.818 --> 15:47.841
He'd been spraying the tunnels
for vermine.

15:47.875 --> 15:51.722
Judging from size of the wound
he'd been attacked with a knife or ax but...

15:51.758 --> 15:52.991
It makes no sense.

15:53.027 --> 15:53.681
Why not?

15:53.727 --> 15:55.941
It's not the wound that's
killing him, it's poison.

15:55.987 --> 16:00.343
You're suggesting soemone took an ax to him and then injected poison
into the wound?

16:00.376 --> 16:02.242
Venom to be precise.

16:02.286 --> 16:04.742
As in snake's and insect's?

16:04.787 --> 16:10.001
We're running every test we can think of
but the truth is we just don't know what we're dealing with.

16:10.047 --> 16:12.282
Did he say anything before he
lost consciousness?

16:14.028 --> 16:15.630
He was babbling about monsters.

16:21.755 --> 16:26.342
It's a single puncture mark but it's
not an knife or an ax, it's more like a bite.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.203
From what?

16:29.787 --> 16:30.463
Good question.

16:34.436 --> 16:36.760
I can't close the underground
on a wild hunch.

16:36.798 --> 16:40.761
Something injected a fatal dose
of venom into his blood stream.

16:40.797 --> 16:42.462
There can be a perfectly rational explanation.

16:42.507 --> 16:44.091
That I'd love to hear.

16:44.138 --> 16:46.912
And how do you suggest I
explain this to the mayor?

16:46.945 --> 16:50.521
Excuse me Sir, would you mind
terribly throwing the whole bloody underground

16:50.568 --> 16:54.180
into chaos because we think there might be
a fair dodgy creeping crawling on the loose somewhere.

16:54.215 --> 16:56.193
We're not talking about shutting
down the whole system.

16:56.236 --> 16:57.942
Jus the area where the attack
took place.

16:57.977 --> 17:00.490
There's a whole network of disused tunnels down there.

17:09.086 --> 17:10.170
Yes, very well.

17:45.967 --> 17:46.852
Vision on, guys.

17:48.247 --> 17:49.283
We should be down there with them.

17:49.327 --> 17:50.263
Special forces go in first.

17:50.296 --> 17:52.871
You didn't think Lester was gonna let you have it all right away.

17:57.655 --> 17:59.181
They don't even know what
they're looking for.

17:59.217 --> 18:02.830
There can't be that many different types of
venomous predator under ***

18:02.868 --> 18:04.893
You should see the ** on
a friday night.

18:21.786 --> 18:23.010
Here, clear it!

18:25.225 --> 18:26.202
Ready? go!

18:32.188 --> 18:32.620
I've gone in.

18:33.895 --> 18:34.352
Clear so far.

18:36.148 --> 18:36.982
Keep it really tight, lads.

18:49.827 --> 18:50.451
Push foward.

18:50.488 --> 18:51.841
Cover the exit.

18:59.905 --> 19:00.541
***

19:00.575 --> 19:01.692
Keep it tight.

19:03.268 --> 19:03.983
***

19:16.877 --> 19:18.010
Abort! Abort!

19:33.447 --> 19:34.591
They're everywhere.

19:40.207 --> 19:42.031
Hold your fire!

19:48.775 --> 19:49.362
Withdraw!

20:00.165 --> 20:04.190
They're like spiders but with
pincers not fangs, some of them meter long.

20:04.228 --> 20:06.872
- Horrible little...
- Tell me how you feel?

20:06.906 --> 20:08.892
Sick, my ears are ringing.

20:08.935 --> 20:10.412
- There's any blood in vision?
- No.

20:10.448 --> 20:13.053
There's something else. The gunshots were too bright like fireworks.

20:13.095 --> 20:15.672
It's classic sign of excess oxygen in the atmosphere.

20:15.716 --> 20:19.993
Rich and more heavily oxygenated air must be sipping through from another anomaly.

20:20.027 --> 20:24.740
We're not talking about the permian
era any longer, this is much much earlier.

20:24.788 --> 20:25.651
How much earlier?

20:25.696 --> 20:29.210
Maybe the carbonipherus, I suppose.
3 hundred million years ago.

20:29.255 --> 20:32.851
We're really need to see exactly
what these creatures look like.

20:32.887 --> 20:34.941
I need to see this for myself.

20:36.726 --> 20:37.422
Ok go.

20:37.467 --> 20:38.733
Let's get some gear.

20:51.446 --> 20:53.061
You wear it well, you look good.

20:57.385 --> 21:00.172
We need torches, the
most powerful you can find.

21:00.207 --> 21:01.953
There are vision goggles.

21:01.998 --> 21:03.090
Vision isn't the issue.

21:03.135 --> 21:06.461
Well, pest controler died a few
minutes ago.

21:06.497 --> 21:09.492
They're running test on our
casualty now.

21:11.158 --> 21:12.260
What she doing?

21:12.295 --> 21:15.683
Abby's got more practical
experience with animals then the rest of us put together.

21:15.728 --> 21:18.600
I don't care if she's Dr. Doolittle.
Sorry, it's just too risky.

21:18.637 --> 21:21.251
I can help, I just finished
studying insect behavior.

21:26.117 --> 21:26.903
Torches.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.280
- Is that true?
- Kind of...

21:32.346 --> 21:34.793
To tell you the truth, spiders
aren't really my thing.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.490
Yeah, well technically these
are probably scorpions.

21:39.135 --> 21:40.690
I feel better already.

22:03.145 --> 22:03.770
On the floor.

22:05.735 --> 22:07.290
What I thought, they're sensitive to the light.

22:25.008 --> 22:26.152
Does anyone have a really big slipper?

22:39.417 --> 22:39.963
I don't like this.

23:19.537 --> 23:20.853
Cutter.

23:46.488 --> 23:47.762
What's happening to us?

24:19.296 --> 24:19.940
Guys...

24:26.898 --> 24:27.432
What  is it?

24:28.907 --> 24:29.421
I don't know. 

24:32.108 --> 24:33.050
It's not a spider.

24:41.315 --> 24:42.001
Run away!

24:49.016 --> 24:49.813
Cutter, what's going on?

24:49.857 --> 24:52.193
Well, there's another creature down here.

24:52.238 --> 24:53.262
But don't worry we're coming out.

24:55.308 --> 24:57.183
Stephen! Stephen, can you see it?

24:57.217 --> 24:58.710
No!

25:18.848 --> 25:19.733
- Go!
- Nick!

25:19.765 --> 25:21.422
Go  Go!
Get Abby out of here!

25:21.457 --> 25:22.243
C'mon!

25:29.175 --> 25:29.592
Damn!

25:54.866 --> 25:56.161
- Nick...
- Hello?

26:03.406 --> 26:04.402
- Nick...
- Who's there?

26:08.585 --> 26:09.130
Helen?

26:13.555 --> 26:15.363
Cutter, come in!

26:17.978 --> 26:18.751
All I'm getting is
interference.

26:20.496 --> 26:23.720
Look, there's no other way out.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.923
These tunnels were blocked 30 years ago.

26:25.965 --> 26:28.361
Then why isn't he back yet?

26:28.408 --> 26:30.892
Look, he's gotta be trapped.
Ok, I'm gonna get back there.

26:30.936 --> 26:33.031
Noone goes anywhere until
we know what we're dealing with.

26:35.057 --> 26:35.663
He could be injured.

26:36.968 --> 26:39.233
I don't wanna leave him down there,
any more than you do.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.710
Bum I'm not losing anyone else
in these wild goose chase.

26:41.756 --> 26:43.141
We don't even know for sure
where he is.

26:43.176 --> 26:45.062
Did just see
what kind of creature it was?

26:45.097 --> 26:46.511
It was some kind of centipede.

26:46.557 --> 26:47.621
But huge.

26:47.668 --> 26:50.990
Give me more, like preferred habitat,
behavioral pattern, strengths, weaknesses.

26:51.038 --> 26:52.342
We don't know, noone does.

26:52.376 --> 26:55.032
Connor might, he's like a walking
encyclopedia of this stuff.

26:55.067 --> 26:58.122
He probably has giant bug
fridge magnets.

26:59.976 --> 27:02.073
Ok, ok, I'll get him here.

27:06.585 --> 27:07.833
Ryan, we need to get Connor...

27:07.877 --> 27:09.870
- I can't leave him in there.
- Cant go back without backup.

27:09.916 --> 27:13.213
- Watch me.
- Stephen.

27:29.935 --> 27:32.250
Hello? Hello?

27:42.345 --> 27:43.073
Cutter!

28:36.635 --> 28:37.272
Cutter!

29:26.347 --> 29:27.420
Cutter!

29:35.325 --> 29:35.831
Oh God!

29:44.916 --> 29:45.743
Oh God, where are you?

29:47.055 --> 29:48.971
- Stephen!
- What's he done?

29:53.276 --> 29:54.383
Stephen, where the hell are you?

29:55.728 --> 29:56.551
He was trying to help.

29:56.597 --> 29:58.171
He's done a really great job, hasn't it?

29:58.218 --> 30:01.320
Stephen come in, Stephen!

30:05.045 --> 30:07.950
That's the problem with heroic gestures, succeed and you
look wonderful,

30:07.988 --> 30:12.152
fail and all you do is leave everybody
else the bloody mess to clear up.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.953
Well done, get down there.

30:20.255 --> 30:20.932
Connor!

30:37.296 --> 30:37.753
Over here!

30:41.396 --> 30:41.991
Help me.

30:52.467 --> 30:53.622
Why don't you say something?

30:59.098 --> 30:59.811
Helen!

31:08.966 --> 31:09.521
Helen...

31:23.168 --> 31:23.683
What happened?

31:25.427 --> 31:27.310
I ***.

31:29.935 --> 31:30.730
Where is it now?

31:33.266 --> 31:34.181
Alright, let's get you out of here.

31:37.315 --> 31:38.670
I ** feeling.

31:38.715 --> 31:39.500
Yeah, it's shock.

31:42.895 --> 31:43.541
Here, take this.

31:51.998 --> 31:53.340
There's something I have
to tell you.

31:53.388 --> 31:54.893
You look like dying, it can wait.

31:54.937 --> 31:56.050
Helen is alive.

31:56.098 --> 32:00.271
She was here, she gave me a message.

32:00.305 --> 32:01.961
Which message?

32:03.626 --> 32:05.422
She's waiting on the other side of the anomaly.

32:05.455 --> 32:09.540
She said, she said if you
wanna know the truth...

32:09.578 --> 32:11.323
You've got to come for it.

32:17.508 --> 32:18.633
Help, we need a medic.

32:25.638 --> 32:27.850
Ok, carbonipherus, so it's probably a Arthropleura.

32:27.896 --> 32:30.342
That's an centipede on steroids basically.

32:30.386 --> 32:33.180
It's more less blind and good sense
of smell and touch.

32:33.228 --> 32:36.510
I mean this thing is pretty big
and scary looking, but it's more or less timid.

32:36.547 --> 32:39.410
It's the kind of bug that
sticks the kitchen applies.

32:39.447 --> 32:41.441
This one must have a
personality disorder.

32:41.478 --> 32:42.541
How dangerous is it?

32:42.575 --> 32:44.543
According to this it
would be in dead wood and leaves.

32:44.578 --> 32:46.742
- They're not poisonous.
- No way.

32:46.775 --> 32:48.893
That's a good thing then.

32:48.938 --> 32:50.833
Medic!
Medic!

32:52.606 --> 32:54.670
Stephen!

32:56.448 --> 32:59.962
He's been bitten. Same wounds, same symptons
as the pest controller.

33:00.006 --> 33:02.590
We need to do something before
it destroys his central nervous system

33:02.635 --> 33:05.861
Poison, the spiders are off the hook,
the centipede is the killer.

33:05.895 --> 33:07.453
Not poisonous, you said.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.762
I was only speculating. 

33:08.796 --> 33:10.672
Tell them about Helen.

33:12.165 --> 33:12.961
She was there.

33:12.997 --> 33:14.210
What's he talking about?

33:16.517 --> 33:17.210
I don't know.

33:19.346 --> 33:20.552
He must be halucinating.

33:20.588 --> 33:22.390
He seemed very lucid to me.

33:26.666 --> 33:27.663
You know you are beautiful.

33:28.938 --> 33:29.850
You're  delirious.

33:30.925 --> 33:31.873
Have dinner with me.

33:32.987 --> 33:34.103
We'll talk about it when you're better.

33:35.165 --> 33:36.300
I can't wait that long.

33:36.338 --> 33:37.860
But I will.

33:37.907 --> 33:42.693
I'll have coffee at your place later and stay for breakfast in the morning.

33:43.888 --> 33:47.240
It's amazing the stuff you say to someone who's dying.

33:47.285 --> 33:49.431
You're not dying.

34:02.825 --> 34:03.780
Who did this to him?

34:03.816 --> 34:05.040
Not who, what?

34:06.546 --> 34:09.232
- It was a centipede.
- What kind of centipede?

34:09.268 --> 34:10.453
It's hard to explain.

34:10.495 --> 34:13.110
If we don't find out exactly
what bit him he will die.

34:13.157 --> 34:16.641
Ok, tell me what you need to find the cure
and I'll give you all the information I can.

34:16.686 --> 34:20.540
There are no obvious treatment,
people just don't die of centipede bite.

34:20.578 --> 34:25.340
But if we can get ahold of a good
sample of the venom we might be able to find an anti-venom that matches his.

34:25.388 --> 34:26.389
Will that make him better?

34:26.435 --> 34:28.911
Anti venom is our last resort.
Toxic in their own might.

34:31.295 --> 34:35.400
His survival rate can be 50% but without
it his chances are nihil.

34:35.438 --> 34:37.231
Just keep him alive.

34:48.676 --> 34:50.293
It's working, they're going back through.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.190
Can't we run some tests and find a
match for the venom somehow?

34:53.235 --> 34:54.893
It would take too long,
he's dying.

34:54.936 --> 34:59.111
The only way to shortcut the process
is to collect a pure sample of venom from the creature that bit him.

34:59.146 --> 35:00.353
How the hell we're gonna do that?

35:00.397 --> 35:02.101
Ask it to fill a speciman jar.

35:03.646 --> 35:04.101
In a way.

35:04.146 --> 35:05.421
Oh come on!

35:05.457 --> 35:06.422
That's the only option.

35:06.456 --> 35:08.702
Ryan, Ryan you there?

35:08.747 --> 35:10.220
3 site's clear.

35:10.267 --> 35:11.742
Moving into second bunker.

35:11.786 --> 35:14.182
Have you seen the centipede yet?

35:16.875 --> 35:18.171
If we lose it, Stephen is dead.

35:18.208 --> 35:22.380
Do not let it return through
the anomaly, repeat, do not let it go back.

35:22.427 --> 35:24.440
And find me something that will do the job.

35:24.485 --> 35:26.070
What are you gonna do?

35:26.117 --> 35:29.162
I'm gonna invite a very angry
centipede to bite me.

35:37.976 --> 35:40.693
Bunker is clear, and it hasn't been gone
through the anomaly on my watch.

35:40.735 --> 35:42.481
There's nowhere else for
it to go.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.063
Either it's already gone throught,
of it's beyond that door.

35:47.355 --> 35:48.322
I'm going there.

35:55.677 --> 35:57.182
Keep your eyes open, this thing's fast.

36:07.716 --> 36:08.432
Clear.

36:22.067 --> 36:22.840
It's gone back.

36:23.846 --> 36:24.610
We must have lost it.

36:25.867 --> 36:26.330
Damn it.

36:35.607 --> 36:38.142
If Stephen wouldn't have gone back for me then he wouldn't have gone bitten.

36:38.188 --> 36:39.663
It wasn't your fault.

36:41.436 --> 36:42.001
Professor!

36:43.178 --> 36:47.001
I forgot, an Arthropleura they supposed to be burrower
so look for a hole in the floor, in the walls, anywhere.

37:10.077 --> 37:10.600
Cutter!

37:11.356 --> 37:11.813
I found it!

37:13.356 --> 37:14.430
I was right, it is still here.

37:17.457 --> 37:18.052
Good work.

37:22.878 --> 37:23.931
How deep could this be?

37:23.965 --> 37:25.760
Creature that size, 50 feet maybe.

37:27.107 --> 37:28.093
Alright, fine I'm going in.

37:28.127 --> 37:29.060
That's crazy.

37:29.097 --> 37:30.950
But there's no other way
of finding out where it's gone.

37:30.988 --> 37:31.890
I'm gonna come too.

37:35.818 --> 37:37.183
- Right.
- Right.

37:37.215 --> 37:38.471
Cool, ok.

37:40.885 --> 37:44.621
If I don't come back
you can have my Star Trek Next Generation **.

37:44.665 --> 37:45.982
I'l treasure them.

37:48.127 --> 37:49.971
You know what, on second thought,
maybe you should bury them with me.

37:51.966 --> 37:53.382
Here, put this in your clothes.

37:53.426 --> 37:56.041
****. Bugs hate it.

37:56.075 --> 37:58.560
Right.

38:33.575 --> 38:36.261
I won't have a panic attack.
I will not have a panic attack.

38:55.538 --> 38:56.670
Could it really have climbled up that?

38:57.487 --> 38:58.052
Let's find out.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.051
Let's give it a chance to get me first.

39:07.237 --> 39:11.191
Claustrophia and vertigo on the same day, this is... fabulous.

39:12.425 --> 39:14.952
Whatever happens, don't shoot till
I got the venom.

40:03.527 --> 40:04.211
Come on!

40:15.918 --> 40:16.472
Stay clear!

40:27.975 --> 40:28.831
Careful Connor!

40:30.175 --> 40:30.833
Let it go.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.122
Let's get this bite to Stephen.

41:26.907 --> 41:27.501
How is he?

41:28.457 --> 41:31.302
Convulsions have stopped.
That's something.

41:33.625 --> 41:34.613
You really like him, don't you?

41:36.745 --> 41:38.242
I don't know him.

41:39.985 --> 41:42.690
When has that ever stopped people
from fancying each other before?

41:45.577 --> 41:47.220
Yoiu see, the same thing happened
to me once.

41:47.268 --> 41:49.151
With the Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.

41:50.125 --> 41:52.263
I mean she's a fictional carachter
but you know when it feels real...

41:53.868 --> 41:56.590
Then she starts hanging around with this
badly animated dog and it all went to bit.

41:58.348 --> 41:58.791
Weird.

42:00.298 --> 42:01.492
But it breaks your heeart at the end of it.

42:08.245 --> 42:08.880
Dr, I think he's back!

42:22.556 --> 42:23.460
- Hi
- Hi.

42:23.496 --> 42:24.520
How you feeling?

42:26.388 --> 42:29.170
Like a ***

42:32.506 --> 42:34.700
So, tell me about Helen.

42:35.976 --> 42:36.662
What about Helen?

42:36.705 --> 42:38.103
You saw her.

42:38.146 --> 42:39.592
I saw her?

42:39.626 --> 42:40.973
When?

42:41.016 --> 42:42.492
In the tunnel, that's what you said.

42:44.537 --> 42:47.252
I was gone, I don't remember
anything.

42:47.296 --> 42:48.761
I was probably just seeing things.

42:50.566 --> 42:52.391
Yeah, probably.

42:58.688 --> 42:59.601
What was that about?

43:01.445 --> 43:03.011
You really can't remember anything after you were bitten.

43:05.265 --> 43:06.870
None of the things you said
in the ambulance.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.941
No, what did I say?

43:10.136 --> 43:11.032
Oh, just stuff.

43:11.748 --> 43:13.451
Just thought some of it must be have stuck.

43:15.687 --> 43:16.392
Was it important?

43:19.025 --> 43:19.721
No, not really.

43:26.045 --> 43:27.291
Thanks for looking after
me, Abby.

43:41.038 --> 43:41.520
Hi.

43:59.737 --> 44:00.973
Does this mean I'm back in?

44:03.456 --> 44:04.533
Any way we can keep you out?

44:05.797 --> 44:06.603
I just wanna help.

44:09.907 --> 44:10.793
You did a good job.

44:14.538 --> 44:17.542
Oh God, you know what,
all my life I wanted to be on a crime busting gang.

44:17.588 --> 44:18.801
and now I am.

44:19.745 --> 44:25.261
So, I don't suppose you'd consider giving
me a cool nickname, would you?

44:27.076 --> 44:27.701
No.

44:31.656 --> 44:32.310
I thought so.

45:03.075 --> 45:04.013
Where are you, Helen?

45:08.617 --> 45:09.512
What do you want?

45:10.018 --> 45:12.513
