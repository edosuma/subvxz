WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:02.936
Listen, man, I know
you got a job to do,

00:02.936 --> 00:04.338
but I shouldn't even be here.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.273
You have the wrong guy.

00:08.208 --> 00:10.944
My men say otherwise.
Start talking.

00:10.944 --> 00:13.113
Any topic in particular

00:13.113 --> 00:15.549
or is this more
of a blue sky situation?

00:15.549 --> 00:19.052
This isn't a joke, Mr. Murtaugh.
Lives are at stake.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.954
Now...

00:20.954 --> 00:23.056
start at the beginning.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.192
Hm. Well, the beginning is

00:25.192 --> 00:27.494
I should've never gone
on that damn vacation.

00:30.831 --> 00:31.999
♪ Keep on movin' till ♪

00:31.999 --> 00:33.634
♪ The first rays of dawn,
keeping it on... ♪

00:33.634 --> 00:37.070
Okay, Murtaugh family
vacation on three.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.305
One...

00:38.305 --> 00:39.773
two...
Baby,

00:39.773 --> 00:41.541
the lens cap.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.644
Do you even know how
to use that thing?

00:43.644 --> 00:47.781
Well, it's new.
I'm learning on the job.

00:47.781 --> 00:48.649
Maybe you can learn later,

00:48.649 --> 00:51.051
after we check in, okay?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.520
All right, let's look.
Oh, perfect.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.256
If we drop Harper
at the kids club now,

00:56.256 --> 00:57.591
we can still make
the nature walk

00:57.591 --> 00:59.893
at 9:30.
Can't I just hang by the pool?

00:59.893 --> 01:03.764
We will. Look, "Relax at pool,
10:30 to 11:00."

01:03.764 --> 01:05.599
Not that I don't appreciate
your hard work, Mom,

01:05.599 --> 01:07.367
it's just you seem
a little wound up,

01:07.367 --> 01:09.102
and it-it's not, it's not you.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.404
Yeah, it's more like Dad.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.373
Riana, let's try
an attitude adjustment.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.410
You told me that I had to come,
not that I had to like it.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.078
Aw, poor you, got caught
drinking at a dance

01:18.078 --> 01:20.447
and your punishment is going
to a resort with your family.

01:20.447 --> 01:21.581
ROGER JR.:
Oh, I think it's,

01:21.581 --> 01:23.450
I think it's great that
we're all here together.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.820
Relaxing, keeping an open mind
about new things.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.023
Thank you, RJ. All right,
clock's ticking, honey.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.124
Let's go check in, Roger.

01:31.124 --> 01:32.826
We'll be right back.
Wow.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.127
You are such
a kiss-ass.

01:34.127 --> 01:37.130
Look, I just want them to be in
the right mood when I tell them.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.266
All right?
That you're raising money

01:39.266 --> 01:40.968
to open a weed store?
No,

01:40.968 --> 01:43.303
small-batch premium dispensary.

01:43.303 --> 01:46.006
And I'm waiting for
the perfect moment, okay?

01:46.006 --> 01:46.907
All right, well, hurry up.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.175
I want to go back
to being the good kid.

01:48.175 --> 01:51.011
Can you believe it?
They stuck us

01:51.011 --> 01:52.279
in courtyard views.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.014
Courtyard.
TRISH: Baby,

01:54.014 --> 01:56.350
we're gonna hardly
be in the room.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.951
It's no big deal.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.820
You're right. I'm fine.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.855
I'm not gonna let anything
ruin this vacation.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.523
COLE: I'm gonna
stop you there, Roger.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.925
That's not
the beginning.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.194
You got to go back
further, to the lean-in.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.596
I'm in the middle
of a story here.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.898
What lean

02:11.898 --> 02:12.966
I thought I told you.
No.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.968
Huh.
I would've remembered
the lean-in.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.103
Gentlemen,
you, uh,

02:16.103 --> 02:19.840
you want to fill me in here?
What exactly is a lean

02:19.840 --> 02:22.342
Do you mind?

02:22.342 --> 02:24.578
Well, there's
this new deputy D.A.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.079
We've been on a bunch
of cases together,

02:26.079 --> 02:28.081
working really hard,
burning the midnight oil.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.617
No, hear me out.
Cole, you are crazy.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.185
It's a solid movie.
You need a doctor.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.320
It's super underrated.
You need help.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.355
Cole, no one on the planet
likes Die Hard 2

02:35.355 --> 02:37.324
better than
Die Hard one.
Well, I do.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.825
I saw that movie
with my mom

02:38.825 --> 02:40.394
when she was on
assignment in Dresden.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.330
It was my birthday,
I didn't know anybody,

02:43.330 --> 02:45.032
so she let me play hooky.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.400
It's dumb,
but I grew up

02:46.400 --> 02:47.834
wanting to be John McClane.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.503
Well, you kind of are.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.904
So where does Mama Cole
live now?

02:50.904 --> 02:53.206
Actually, she died

02:53.206 --> 02:56.410
a long time ago.
Oh, I... I'm so sorry.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.211
I-I didn't know.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.579
She wasn't also in the...

02:59.579 --> 03:01.782
CIA? No. Photojournalist.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.284
Oh, badass. So you guys
were close?

03:04.284 --> 03:07.187
Yeah, very.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.523
It was the two of us
for so long.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.559
She knew me better than anyone.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.061
How 'bout the senator?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.395
Are you guys close?

03:15.395 --> 03:16.997
Let's just say it's complicated.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.232
But she is in town this week.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.401
Visiting her daughter.
That's nice.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.536
That would be nice.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.238
No, she's sponsoring
a big climate bill,

03:25.238 --> 03:26.940
so she's here to speak
at a summit.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.075
I'm just an afterthought.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.210
After is better than none.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.945
Mm, not always.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.548
She wants to come here
to see what I do all day.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.017
I think she just wants
a photo op with a cop.
Mm.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.052
I'm happy to oblige.
No.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.922
No way. You're not going
anywhere near my mother.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.090
Mothers love me.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.926
Everyone likes you, Cole.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.961
You're very likeable.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.502
What are you doing?

03:56.970 --> 03:59.573
Oh, I was just, I was reaching
for the pad kee mao.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.475
It's right behind you.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.943
Cole, you were leaning in.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.612
No. I wasn't.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.848
I know a lean-in when I see one.
That was a lean-in.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.783
Erica, I promise you.
I was reaching for the...

04:09.783 --> 04:13.420
Pad kee mao, you said.
Uh, this is wildly off-topic.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.621
It's important for context.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.056
So what
happened

04:16.056 --> 04:17.224
next?
Nothing.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.926
She pretended to get a phone
call and then she left the room.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.128
Right, but between us,

04:21.128 --> 04:22.462
you're just playing it cool

04:22.462 --> 04:24.097
'cause you got rejected, but...

04:24.097 --> 04:26.366
I wasn't rejected
because I wasn't leaning in.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.367
The case.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.635
You said this was
about the case.

04:28.635 --> 04:32.139
I was getting to that.
Geez, relax, buddy.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.440
You'll live longer.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.210
Hey, Bailey.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.345
What do we got?

04:38.345 --> 04:39.946
Victim's a John Doe.
No ID.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.781
Car reported stolen
two days ago.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.451
Is that cocaine
on the dash?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.886
Yeah, sure is.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.455
Looks like he had
a hell of a night.
That's not all, though. Look.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.957
Holy Christmas!
His pants are fully down.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.692
Really didn't need to look.
I'm talking about

04:52.692 --> 04:55.529
the stiletto
in the passenger seat.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.631
Yeah, that's not
what caught my eye. Okay.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.534
So John Doe
goes partying, crashes,

05:00.534 --> 05:02.402
lady friend takes off.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.971
But the car's barely damaged.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.106
My thoughts exactly.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.774
The airbags
didn't even deploy.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.476
This dude was dead
before the crash.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.810
I'm thinking Cinderella
took him out.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.679
Boom. Already got a suspect.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.848
Hate to say it, guys,
but without Roger,

05:14.848 --> 05:16.783
we're moving like lightning.
Ah, it won't last.

05:16.783 --> 05:19.286
I'll give him 24 hours before he
gets bored with his vacation.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.821
But he was so excited.
All that stuff about sipping

05:21.821 --> 05:23.290
from a coconut.
It was all talk.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.058
He doesn't know how to take time
off. Last year he worked

05:25.058 --> 05:26.927
through a family trip in Hawaii.
It's true.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.162
I got an e-mail from him
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.199
And he once called me
from a massage table.
Wow. That is...

05:32.199 --> 05:33.934
Not as bad as it seems.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.169
My masseuse has
a very light touch.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.371
COLE:
Well, if you knew
how to take time off,

05:38.371 --> 05:40.140
you wouldn't be here.
I love

05:40.140 --> 05:42.409
vacation.
Wh-Why does everybody

05:42.409 --> 05:44.344
think I don't?
Who's everybody?

05:44.344 --> 05:47.714
Baby, all I'm saying is

05:47.714 --> 05:50.083
taking time off
isn't your forte.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.351
You tend to gravitate

05:51.351 --> 05:52.719
toward stress.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.589
That's Detective
Murtaugh's stress.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.592
Right now I'm
Mr. Chillaxamoto.

05:58.592 --> 06:02.462
Hey, Dad, RJ knows a great
way to reduce stress.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.164
Really?
Tell him.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.299
Do I look like the kind of guy

06:06.299 --> 06:08.969
who cannot relax?

06:08.969 --> 06:12.772
Look at me. Right now I have it
made in the shade.

06:12.772 --> 06:16.476
Just promise me you won't let
work intrude on our vacation.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.879
Sweetheart,
for the next three days,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.348
the only mystery
I'm interested in

06:21.348 --> 06:24.718
is by Mr. Thomas Clancy.
Okay.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.189
Is that rum?

06:29.189 --> 06:30.490
You know you
can't have rum.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.092
Wait, why can't Mom have rum?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.693
It's fine, honey.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.496
Relax. It's not rum.
Okay, okay.

06:36.496 --> 06:40.467
Okay. Wow.
One little adjustment.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.903
Oh, my gosh.
Roger, sit down.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.706
But my extremities
are exposed to the sun.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.909
I can't relax if
I'm getting skin cancer.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.512
Be-be careful,
that thing's heavy.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.015
And you guys say
that I can't relax?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.316
Roger, sit down.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.920
I'm simply going to slide
my chair into the sh...

06:59.920 --> 07:01.021
Aah!

07:01.021 --> 07:01.821
TRISH: Roger!

07:01.821 --> 07:03.290
Ooh!
Roger, oh, my gosh.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.292
Oh, my goodness.
Is it your back?

07:05.292 --> 07:06.293
It hurts.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.828
Okay, I-I-I'm sorry.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.531
You two are responsible
for millions in damages,

07:11.531 --> 07:12.799
dozens of lives in danger,

07:12.799 --> 07:15.302
and multiple breaches
of national security.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.937
How is any of this relevant?

07:17.937 --> 07:20.740
Well, this is just
the beginning.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.609
COLE:
Anybody else hungry?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.311
Maybe we should
get some menus.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.446
♪ ♪

07:29.316 --> 07:30.650
Hold on.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.018
Don't worry.
All right, slow.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.054
Slow. Roger, slow.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.488
Use your muscles. Use
your stomach muscles.

07:35.488 --> 07:36.589
MURTAUGH: Stomach?
TRISH: There you go.

07:36.589 --> 07:37.957
Oh... all right, all right.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.493
I can't believe you
threw your back out
Come on, baby.

07:40.493 --> 07:41.928
30 seconds into vacation.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.129
Gentle, gentle.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.465
Does this mean
that we can go home?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.200
No, it doesn't.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.003
Okay, the resort doctor said
that as long as your father

07:50.003 --> 07:53.540
rests today and takes
his muscle relaxers,

07:53.540 --> 07:54.808
that he'll be fine tomorrow,

07:54.808 --> 07:57.010
so plenty of vacation
time left, okay?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.013
Oh!

08:00.013 --> 08:01.981
Oh, shoot, paddle boarding
in 15 minutes.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.851
But, you know,
we don't have to go.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.786
No, no, no, no. Go.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.922
Okay, thanks, Dad. See you. Bye.
Okay, feel better, Pops.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.191
Okay...

08:11.191 --> 08:13.293
They're gonna put us
in a home, aren't they?

08:13.293 --> 08:15.295
Big time.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.596
You okay?

08:16.596 --> 08:18.732
How c... how can I be Mr. Chill

08:18.732 --> 08:20.300
if I'm stuck in a room?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.435
Mm, read your book.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.004
Huh? And...

08:25.004 --> 08:28.441
learn how to use your camera,

08:28.441 --> 08:30.110
and enjoy the view, honey.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.078
Of a courtyard.
Wait, where-where you going

08:32.078 --> 08:33.079
in that outfit?

08:33.079 --> 08:34.647
Guess what, you get
that back together,

08:34.647 --> 08:36.149
and I'll take it off for you.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.895
Let's see.

08:48.895 --> 08:52.232
How hard can this thing
be to use?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.402
Mm.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.471
Crystal clear.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.042
Let's see.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.052
MURTAUGH: Oh!

09:13.052 --> 09:16.322
Must be newlyweds.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.191
Can't wait another second, huh?

09:18.191 --> 09:19.793
I respect you, sir.

09:19.793 --> 09:23.663
What else do we got here?

09:31.571 --> 09:32.806
BAILEY:
You're free to go.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.641
Thanks for coming in.
Looks like my mother

09:34.641 --> 09:36.876
picked an interesting
day to visit.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.612
Yeah, sorry. They're witnesses
on the John Doe case.

09:39.612 --> 09:40.880
The senator's really here?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.183
ERICA:
Yeah. She asked me to find her

09:43.183 --> 09:45.919
loose-leaf jasmine tea,
in a police station.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.822
Check Avery's desk,
bottom drawer.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.957
You didn't hear
that from me, though.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.326
Thank you. Whatever they're
paying you, it's not enough.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.963
Are we having a party?

09:56.963 --> 09:58.932
Funny.
What do you got?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.668
Our John Doe's GPS indicates
the last place he visited

10:01.668 --> 10:02.936
was on Santa Monica
and Highland.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.005
Solicitation central.
John Doe was with a pro.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.340
And she might've killed him.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.809
The cocaine found on the dash
tested positive for ricin.

10:09.809 --> 10:13.513
Ricin? Any of these ladies
see anything suspicious?

10:13.513 --> 10:14.781
One of them
saw a girl

10:14.781 --> 10:16.749
who was on the corner
in a bright pink wig.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.819
Well, I'll help
question the rest.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.120
Go twice as fast.
Okay.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.922
Well, there's some call girls
in the other room,

10:22.922 --> 10:26.192
if you want
to take a run at it. Hello?

10:26.192 --> 10:27.994
Good morning.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.129
I just want to start
by saying

10:30.129 --> 10:31.331
that this is
a judgment-free zone.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.333
I have absolutely no problem
with what you do.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.301
Oh, uh, thank you.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.004
And you are?
I'm one of the
detectives here.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.106
Now, I don't want to take up
too much of your time.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.508
I know how hard
you work out there

10:41.508 --> 10:42.942
all day,
pounding the pavement.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.777
It can be a challenging
profession.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.813
Everybody's got to make a buck.
Actually,

10:46.813 --> 10:48.715
most of us
aren't in it for the money.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.817
It's more of a calling.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.586
That must be why
they call you call girls.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.421
I'm sorry, what?

10:55.421 --> 10:57.290
That's not the preferred term?

10:57.290 --> 11:00.360
I'm just as happy
to call you a prostitute.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.961
ERICA:
Cole!

11:01.961 --> 11:03.429
What are you doing
to my mother?

11:04.531 --> 11:07.400
Your mother. The senator?

11:07.400 --> 11:11.237
Not a...
Prostitute. No.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.840
You want to tell me
why you'd assume

11:13.840 --> 11:15.141
my mother was a prostitute?

11:15.141 --> 11:18.611
Not really. It's possible
that I got the wrong room.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.513
So this is Detective Cole.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.649
Mom, can you give us a minute?

11:22.649 --> 11:24.884
Of course.
If you need me,

11:24.884 --> 11:26.686
I'll be outside,

11:26.686 --> 11:29.689
rethinking my entire wardrobe.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.092
Sorry, Senator.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.128
:
Moms usually love me.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.696
This is about the lean-in,
isn't it?

11:36.696 --> 11:37.864
You're trying to get back at me.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.132
I wasn't trying
to get back at you,

11:39.132 --> 11:40.166
because I wasn't leaning in.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.235
Fine, Cole.
Whatever you say.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.436
I just want to forget
this happened

11:43.436 --> 11:45.338
and go back to being
professional colleagues.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.139
Can we do that?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.774
Of course.
That's what I want, too.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.310
Good.

11:51.644 --> 11:52.645
MURTAUGH:
So you were lying.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.814
No, I meant it.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.082
Erica and I are
just co-workers.

11:56.082 --> 11:59.052
My God, will one of you please
get to the point?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.187
Well, I guess not
everybody appreciates

12:01.187 --> 12:04.190
the nuances of
character development.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.725
Murtaugh, what happened next?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.828
I assume you didn't spend all
day spying on hotel guests.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.029

you've got confidence.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.279
You shouldn't, but you do.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.815

What did we order
for lunch today?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.398
Hello?

13:18.398 --> 13:21.801
Bailey, we have a situation
at the Malibu Winds Resort.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.069
Send everyone.

13:25.004 --> 13:28.274
Told you. That man doesn't know
how to take a vacation.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.379
Gentlemen,
it's my understanding

13:33.379 --> 13:35.315
that after what you saw
in room 437,

13:35.315 --> 13:38.251
you asked a detective from RHD
to investigate.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.789
And what did she find?

13:42.789 --> 13:44.157
You know what she found.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.926
BAILEY:
Nothing.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.428
No evidence of any altercation.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.495
That's impossible.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.264
I know what I saw.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.999
You saw a family getting lunch.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.200
Grace and Stuart Stevenson,

13:54.200 --> 13:56.002
from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Their kids,

13:56.002 --> 13:58.938
Jimmy and Kelly, all
present and accounted for.

13:58.938 --> 14:00.873
What about the muzzle flash?

14:00.873 --> 14:02.775
It could have been light
reflecting from the tray.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.244
I saw them raise their hands
and back up.

14:05.244 --> 14:06.479
To avoid a juice spill.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.948
I checked the stain myself.
No.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.284
No. I know what I saw.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.286
How many of these pills
have you been taking?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.387
'Cause you know it
screws you up, right?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.788
Hey, it is not in my head.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.090
I-I sent you photos.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.858
These photos?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.397
I'm still getting
used to the camera.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.265
Mm, clearly.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.137
Trish, you believe me, right?

14:31.137 --> 14:32.772
I wish I could.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.407
Look, if something
is going down,

14:34.407 --> 14:35.975
Capitol Police will find it

14:35.975 --> 14:38.044
Capitol Police?
They're like the Secret Service
for senators.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.613
They're here prepping for
Senator Malick's climate summit

14:40.613 --> 14:42.582
tomorrow.
A climate summit.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.550
That can't be
a coincidence.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.853
That's what this is all about.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.788
How?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.424
I don't know yet.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.993
Okay, okay.
Thank you, Bailey.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.661
My husband needs a little rest.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.434
Trish, there's something
fishy going on here.
I agree.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.170
You promised that you would
take time off from work,

15:04.170 --> 15:05.972
and on the first day
of vacation,

15:05.972 --> 15:07.940
you stumble onto a case.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.142
What, do you think
I'm making this all up?

15:09.142 --> 15:10.009
:
Oh, gosh,

15:10.009 --> 15:12.445
I think you need to stop
mixing Tom Clancy

15:12.445 --> 15:13.946
with muscle relaxers.

15:13.946 --> 15:17.316
So, I am going to go snorkeling
with our kids,

15:17.316 --> 15:20.019
and you are gonna let this go.

15:20.019 --> 15:23.289
Okay? Mwah.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.058
Let it go.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.560
That's not a snorkeling outfit.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.095
It's in my bag.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.876
What the hell you looking at?

15:45.344 --> 15:46.779
But you didn't let it go,

15:46.779 --> 15:49.115
despite having no evidence
of wrongdoing.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.616
Oh, there was evidence.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.552
Now he's gonna tell you
about Tonga Ted's.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.586
It's not evidence, Roger.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.122
Men have been convicted
for less.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.356
They definitely haven't.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.192
All right, I'll bite.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.726
Tell me about Tonga Ted's.

16:00.726 --> 16:04.163
It's the restaurant downstairs.
I called the maître d'.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.266
The Stevensons had
a lunch reservation an hour ago,

16:07.266 --> 16:08.334
and they never showed up.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.369
Who comes to a four-star resort

16:10.369 --> 16:11.804
and doesn't leave the room?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.706
Someone who lost a fight
to a pool chair.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.543
Oh, crap.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.212
Listen, here's what I think:

16:19.212 --> 16:21.380
someone infiltrated the family.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.782
They're impersonating
the father,

16:22.782 --> 16:24.684
and they're forcing the others
to play along.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.253
Why would someone infiltrate
a family from Iowa?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.421
I don't know.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.523
But I bet there's evidence
in that room.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.657
I need to get the family out

16:31.657 --> 16:33.092
so I can get in there and look.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.696
Wh

16:36.696 --> 16:40.533
Nothing. Just, uh, burned
a burrito in the toaster oven.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.369
Not a big deal.
Set off the alarm.

16:43.369 --> 16:44.637
Fire alarm.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.147
Nothing.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.850
Who the hell are you?
Capitol Police.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.086
You're under arrest.
Get him up.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.454
Wait, wait, no, wait.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.890
Roger, the fire alarm.
We came back to...

18:10.890 --> 18:12.325
Roger.
Where's your father?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.726
Where's Dad?

18:16.495 --> 18:17.496
I-I think I found him.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.131
What?

18:19.131 --> 18:21.667
Aah! Oh...

18:21.667 --> 18:23.736
And now you're here.
Yeah.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.705
With a slipped disc,
probably.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.207
You can thank your
storm troopers for that.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.942
Which leaves you, Cole.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.645
Care to explain
how a John Doe case

18:32.645 --> 18:34.480
led to a threat
on the senator's life?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.282
You say threat,
I say a funny story.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.550
Actually, it started
right before

18:37.550 --> 18:39.785
Roger called about Tonga Ted's.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.022
Burrito time.
What's up, Bailey?

18:43.022 --> 18:44.657
Turns out one of our call girls
knew our John Doe.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.892
He was a regular.
Dick Murphy.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.494
Defense contractor
at Northrop.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.564
So Dick had access to weapons
and military secrets.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.199
Could be why he got killed.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.934
I'll head over there now.
Five minutes?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.669
That's way too long.
Thanks, Bailey.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.904
But I've been heating up
burritos my whole life.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.240
BARRETT:
I know the rest.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.209
What happened at Northrop?

19:03.209 --> 19:05.745
When I got there, I found out
that somebody had swiped in

19:05.745 --> 19:07.646
using dead Dick's
security badge.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.882
The guy was still there
when I arrived.

19:15.287 --> 19:17.123
Hey, Dick, is that you?

19:17.123 --> 19:20.026
I thought you were dead.
You look fantastic.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.098
The SR60 Advanced-Combat Humvee.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.734
Fortitude of a tank,
horsepower of a Mustang.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.770
Now, of course,
this is just a prototype.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.139
We're still working out the
kinks with the braking...
COLE: Stop!

19:33.139 --> 19:34.206
Police!

19:37.176 --> 19:38.577
Down!

20:12.178 --> 20:14.146
MALICK: Let's keep this
Northrop Davis visit brief.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.382
I want to get back to the
hotel to work on my speech.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.885
Copy that. Ma'am, someone
pulled the hotel fire alarm

20:19.885 --> 20:21.020
and broke into a room.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.322
He's in custody,
but we may need to find

20:23.322 --> 20:24.557
a new location for the summit.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.759
No. The optics
would be a disaster.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.694
I want you to talk
to this guy personally.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.629
Find out
what he's up to.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.998
Yes, ma'am.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.988
Look out!

21:11.670 --> 21:13.806
Out of the car!
Out of the vehicle!

21:13.806 --> 21:15.474
Hands where I can see them.

21:15.474 --> 21:18.944
AGENT: Cover the driver's side,
he's coming out.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.613
AGENT 2:
Don't move!

21:24.283 --> 21:25.718
Detective Cole.

21:25.718 --> 21:29.221
I'm starting to think I may not
be making the best impression.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.425
BARRETT: Thank you for your
explanations, gentlemen.

21:33.425 --> 21:37.930
They were...
colorful.

21:37.930 --> 21:38.931
COLE:
Then can I go?

21:38.931 --> 21:39.999
I got a date with a bad guy

21:39.999 --> 21:41.033
on a stolen motorcycle.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.301
BARRETT:
I just got off with RHD.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.803
They found the bike dumped
on an overpass in Tujunga.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.305
Your story checks out.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.439
What about my story?

21:47.439 --> 21:49.074
Stevenson's an imposter, right?

21:49.074 --> 21:50.376
Well, I ran a background check.

21:50.376 --> 21:53.579
Stuart Stevenson owns a
chain of soup restaurants,

21:53.579 --> 21:55.114
treasurer of
his Elks Club.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.283
Former Eagle Scout.
So he can tie a knot.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.618
That doesn't make him
any less dangerous.

21:59.618 --> 22:00.719
I have men everywhere.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.121
Metal detectors
at every entrance.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.989
No one's getting anywhere
near Senator Malick

22:03.989 --> 22:05.825
without being vetted.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.660
Wow. A lot of people must
really hate Erica's mom.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.230
Her climate bill hasn't made her
any friends in the oil industry.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.866
But I can assure you, the
chowder king of Cedar Rapids

22:13.866 --> 22:16.402
isn't at the top
of our list of concerns.

22:16.402 --> 22:19.205
Yeah, well, maybe he ought
to be. Tell him, Cole.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.773
Go ahead.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.541
Tell him you believe me.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.376
Well, Roger, I believe
you think you saw something,

22:24.376 --> 22:25.377
but as far as facts go...

22:25.377 --> 22:26.745
Facts? Here's a fact.

22:26.745 --> 22:27.913
You're my partner.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.181
You're supposed
to have my back.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.950
I want to, but there's
not even a sign of a crime.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.620
I, on the other hand, have
a legitimate crime to solve.
A legitimate crime to solve?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.388
Say that again.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.023
You and your Tom Clancy
and your pain pills.
What's so different between...

22:38.023 --> 22:40.359
Tom Clancy is a great writer.
Enough!

22:40.359 --> 22:43.162
Cole, you're free to go.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.897
But the senator's
asked for a word.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.031
Good, someone's in trouble.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.266
Real mature.
Murtaugh,

22:47.266 --> 22:49.101
my men will escort you
to your room.

22:50.302 --> 22:51.971
And if I see either
of you again,

22:51.971 --> 22:54.073
I will have you both
arrested for treason.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.741
That clear?
Treason.

22:55.741 --> 22:58.143
Who doesn't understand treason?

23:00.312 --> 23:02.848
Dude, I can't believe
you still haven't told Mom.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.950
What? I-I-I didn't have
a window.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.485
All she's done is
complain about Dad.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.821
Yeah, when she's not making
digs about me drinking.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.023
She's been so intense.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.092
Well, don't piss her off more.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.894
I-I'm still looking
for the perfect moment.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.564
I hear you.
Thank you so much.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.532
Yeah. Bye.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.700
You believe this?

23:21.700 --> 23:25.070
Four hours, and they are still
holding your father.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.805
He just couldn't let it go.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.140
And now he's gonna be
on his back

23:28.140 --> 23:30.042
for the rest of the vacation.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.043
Well, if Dad's out
of commission,

23:31.043 --> 23:32.444
then why don't
we just go home?

23:32.444 --> 23:36.215
Riana, you're the one who chose
to drink hard lemonade, not me.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.083
So I don't want to hear
your attitude.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.986
My attitude?
ROGER JR.:
Oh, uh,

23:40.986 --> 23:42.988
what about pot stickers
for the, for the table?

23:42.988 --> 23:45.391
Who's in?
You've been crazy
this whole trip.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.525
And you're so worried

23:46.525 --> 23:48.560
we're not having fun
that we haven't had any.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.296
First of all, that's not true.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.297
Mm.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.831
I

23:52.831 --> 23:54.967
Oh, my God.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.402
You're right.

23:56.402 --> 23:59.605
I just wanted to make memories
with our family,

23:59.605 --> 24:00.673
and now I've screwed it up.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.841
Mom, I'm just saying that
you could loosen up a bit.

24:02.841 --> 24:03.976
WAITRESS:
Drinks for the table.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.313
Here we are.
Thank you.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.586
Oh. Excuse me,
I didn't order this.

24:14.586 --> 24:15.721
It-it has rum.

24:15.721 --> 24:17.156
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.223
I'll grab you a new one.

24:18.223 --> 24:19.992
Okay, no, you know what?

24:19.992 --> 24:23.629
Second thought, leave the drink.
Thank you.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.697
So, why don't
we just, um...?

24:24.697 --> 24:25.964
To vacation.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.733
All right.
All right, let's,
let's loosen up.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.536
Okay.

24:32.371 --> 24:36.008
Detective, thank you
for taking the time

24:36.008 --> 24:39.044
after such an eventful day.

24:39.044 --> 24:42.147
I would apologize, but
I wouldn't know where to start.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.849
Well, that's not necessary.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.651
From what I gather,
you're no stranger

24:45.651 --> 24:47.086
to eventful days.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.160
My service record.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.262
You pulled it.
I was curious about

24:57.262 --> 24:59.431
the man who's so taken
with my daughter.

24:59.431 --> 25:02.768
If this is about the lean-in,
let me explain it.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.770
There was some pad kee mao...

25:04.770 --> 25:06.004
Your résumé is impressive.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.740
From what I can read of it.

25:07.740 --> 25:11.310
Most of your file
is redacted.

25:11.310 --> 25:16.181
I'm curious, where were you
from 2007 to 2009?

25:16.181 --> 25:19.184
Nowhere I can talk about.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.421
Got it.

25:22.421 --> 25:26.692
And what, exactly, were you
doing in Busan?

25:26.692 --> 25:29.395
Officially? Backpacking.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.497
And Somalia,

25:31.497 --> 25:34.666
Karachi...

25:34.666 --> 25:36.335
Tbilisi?

25:38.036 --> 25:40.072
Something tells me
you already know the answer.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.876
You chose a noble path, Cole.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.345
But I don't need to know
what's under these black marks

25:46.345 --> 25:48.614
to know the baggage
that comes with them.

25:48.614 --> 25:52.184
With all due respect, Senator,
you don't even know me.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.520
Neither does she.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.456
And if this file
is any indication,

25:57.456 --> 25:59.491
she never will.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.995
So, what do you want me to do?

26:02.995 --> 26:04.596
You have a daughter, don't you?

26:04.596 --> 26:07.666
If someone like you
came into her life,

26:07.666 --> 26:09.968
what would you want him to do?

26:21.780 --> 26:22.648
Erica.

26:24.616 --> 26:25.684
Were you waiting for me?

26:25.684 --> 26:27.519
What

26:27.519 --> 26:31.123
I was just finishing
some important depositions

26:31.123 --> 26:33.525
on the, um...

26:33.525 --> 26:35.694
Yeah, okay, I was
waiting for you.

26:35.694 --> 26:39.131
Oh. Okay. Why?

26:39.131 --> 26:43.969
Cole, there are 938
deputy D.A.s in L.A.,

26:43.969 --> 26:46.705
so don't you think
it's a little strange that

26:46.705 --> 26:48.373
I keep working cases with you?

26:48.373 --> 26:51.109
Maybe we're just lucky.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.611
Cole, I pick my cases.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.147
Okay.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.148
Why are you telling me this?

26:56.148 --> 26:57.616
Because I screwed up.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.752
When you leaned in,
I panicked...
It wasn't a lean-in.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.554
Just shut up.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.456
I pulled back
because I was scared.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.559
I don't date at work.
I don't date cops.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.329
But all I wanted was
for you to make a move.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.464
But you don't even
really know me.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.632
I want to learn.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.367
Like, what if I were

27:15.367 --> 27:19.037
to just lean in
right now and

27:19.037 --> 27:21.573
ki...

27:23.775 --> 27:26.411
Oh, I-- okay.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.380
Listen, it's not you.
Oh, uh...

27:28.380 --> 27:29.948
No, uh, that's--
that-that's fine.

27:29.948 --> 27:30.949
It's okay, it's good.
Erica.

27:30.949 --> 27:34.052
Erica.
This is humiliating,

27:34.052 --> 27:36.855
so I'm gonna leave now,

27:36.855 --> 27:39.591
and we're never gonna talk
about this again.

28:51.196 --> 28:53.198
Uh...

28:53.198 --> 28:54.700
Good morning.

28:54.700 --> 28:57.869
:
It's not a good morning.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.542
Oh, my God, last night did I...?

29:03.542 --> 29:06.545
Yes.
The kids told me everything.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.313
Gosh. The kids?

29:08.313 --> 29:10.248
All right,
what time is it, Roger?

29:10.248 --> 29:12.117
The zip line is at 8:45.

29:12.117 --> 29:13.452
They already left.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.387
Zip-lining seemed
like a bad idea

29:15.387 --> 29:17.322
for you and everyone
below you.

29:17.322 --> 29:20.926
Oh, my God, baby,
my brain is on fire.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.995
I told you about the rum.

29:22.995 --> 29:26.264
See, the lesson is:
always trust your husband.

29:30.902 --> 29:32.604
Roger,

29:32.604 --> 29:34.673
what are you doing
with that camera?

29:34.673 --> 29:37.142
Nothing.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.844
You're still drunk.
Go back to sleep.

29:38.844 --> 29:42.247
Tell me you're not still
watching that family, Roger.

29:42.247 --> 29:43.315
Of course I'm not.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.550
I'm-I'm watching
the honeymooners.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.753
You know they still haven't
come up for air yet.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.021
Reminds me of us.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.756
You see, you are unbelievable.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.024
You got arrested

29:52.024 --> 29:53.659
and you still haven't
let it go.

29:53.659 --> 29:56.628
Because that kid
over there needs me.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.431
He told me.
Really

29:59.431 --> 30:00.732
Yes, with his finger.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.370
Roger... no more pills.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.339
No more spying.

30:07.339 --> 30:11.376
You have got
to stop this right...

30:11.376 --> 30:15.647
Oh, my God, not again.
Oh, my God.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.049
Oh, my God.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.551
Okay, well, you're gonna
probably want your privacy.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.486
I'm just gonna

30:21.486 --> 30:24.156
go out and get you
some ginger ale.

30:24.156 --> 30:27.059
And some mouthwash.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.398
The sole fingerprint left
by the intruder at Northrop.

30:33.398 --> 30:35.901
Guess what, I got a hit.

30:35.901 --> 30:36.935
I thought there were no matches.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.737
In the LAPD database maybe.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.473
But I cross-checked
with customs records, and...

30:41.473 --> 30:43.375
Meet Adrian Sokolov.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.744
Former FSB agent.
Filed a work visa

30:45.744 --> 30:47.379
through Russia's
state-owned oil company.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.381
Good work,
but we still need to find

30:49.381 --> 30:50.982
the call girl in the pink wig.

30:50.982 --> 30:52.818
Way ahead of you.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.854
Okay, or he had an accomplice.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.489
Either one's a possibility,
really.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.224
Is that your
new girlfriend?

30:59.224 --> 31:01.093
No, unless
you're jealous.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.961
I'm not.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.397
So I think I know why our
suspect broke into Northrop.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.065
Our dead guy Dick was working
on a prototype

31:07.065 --> 31:09.367
for a 3-D-printed plastic gun,
and now it's missing.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.936
SCORSESE:
So the former FSB agent's

31:10.936 --> 31:13.405
trying to sneak guns into
a place that doesn't allow guns?

31:13.405 --> 31:14.840
Right, to evade metal detectors.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.142
Could be sneaking onto
a plane, in a courtroom...

31:17.142 --> 31:20.245
No. It's a hotel.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.852
What do you want?

31:26.852 --> 31:28.453
I need your help.

31:28.453 --> 31:29.721
You mean, have your back?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.623
No can do. I'm on vacation.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.225
Roger, you were right.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.893
Say that again.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.228
I'm pretty sure
that a Russian oil company

31:36.228 --> 31:39.197
is trying to take out Senator
Malick at today's summit.

31:39.197 --> 31:40.799
Guess who's got front row seats.

31:40.799 --> 31:41.900
Stuart Stevenson.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.770
I know. He's picking up
his security badge.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.638
I'm thinking somebody's
holding his family hostage,

31:46.638 --> 31:47.939
trying to use Stuart
to get access.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.107
I knew it.

31:49.107 --> 31:49.975
I mean, nobody believed me.

31:49.975 --> 31:51.343
This is what I was saying
all along.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.344
Roger,

31:52.344 --> 31:53.645
you can gloat later, I promise.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.214
I'm on my way, but right now
we got to stop Stuart.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.416
I'm on it.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.986
WOMAN:
Just sign in here...

32:07.192 --> 32:08.994
Don't move.

32:08.994 --> 32:11.329
You're the guy
who's been watching us.

32:11.329 --> 32:12.464
You called the police.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.499
I am the police.
You're under arrest.

32:17.402 --> 32:20.572
No, you got to let me go,
please.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.474
I appreciate the please, but no.

32:22.474 --> 32:25.343
You don't understand.
They've got my wife.

32:25.343 --> 32:26.645
They're gonna kill her.

32:26.645 --> 32:27.913
Well, if they have your wife,

32:27.913 --> 32:29.614
then who's that woman
in the room?

32:51.369 --> 32:52.370
STUART:
I got invited to the summit

32:52.370 --> 32:53.471
as a donor to the senator.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.907
So we decided to make it
a family vacation.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.944
But when we got here,
these bellhops showed up,

32:58.944 --> 32:59.845
man and a woman.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.746
And the gunshot?
A warning.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.415
Then the man took
my wife Grace.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.684
Said if we didn't go along,
they'd kill her.

33:05.684 --> 33:06.852
Now I'm supposed
to pretend

33:06.852 --> 33:09.855
that woman, Eve, is my wife,
get her into the summit.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.189
MURTAUGH:
I bet she's gonna take a shot

33:11.189 --> 33:13.592
during the senator's speech,
make a statement.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.594
We got to stop the speech.
You can't.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.862
They'll kill Grace.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.396
COLE:
Then we have to
find her first.

33:18.396 --> 33:19.531
Any idea where they took her?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.700
Close by. When he left
to check on her,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.401
he was back
in ten minutes.

33:23.401 --> 33:24.903
Then she's still here.

33:24.903 --> 33:27.672
Somewhere no employee
would ever go.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.342
Like a honeymoon suite
with the curtains drawn

33:30.342 --> 33:31.643
for two days?

33:31.643 --> 33:33.378
No one has stamina like that.

33:33.378 --> 33:35.280
Okay, check it out.
Mr. Stevenson,

33:35.280 --> 33:37.415
go back to your room,
pretend everything's normal.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.485
And what are
you gonna do?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.322
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.894
Sir, you need a security pass.
LAPD.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.662
I have intel on a credible
threat to the senator.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.430
We can't move until a hostage
is safe, but...

33:52.430 --> 33:54.399
I got a LAPD
officer here.

33:54.399 --> 33:55.667
Says there's a...
Wow, really?

33:55.667 --> 33:57.869
You Detective Cole
or Murtaugh?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.838
Cole. Is that Barrett?
He knows me.

33:59.838 --> 34:02.474
It's Cole.
Should I hold him?

34:02.474 --> 34:04.776
We'll handle this, sir.
Wait here.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.081
LAPD. Anyone in here?

34:18.023 --> 34:19.190
You're okay.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.293
I'm here to save you.

34:36.274 --> 34:39.511
My back. You fixed it!

34:43.415 --> 34:46.885
You, sir, are a miracle worker.

34:48.186 --> 34:49.621
Let's get you out of here.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.323
MAN:
Senator Malick,
this way, please.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.824
WOMAN:
Senator Malick, over here.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.160
Detective.
He's on the move.

34:55.160 --> 34:58.096
MAN 2:
Senator, will you support...?
Excuse me.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.767
Senator.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.903
Cole, what are
you doing here?

35:04.903 --> 35:07.872
Stand down, Detective, we've got
the situation under control.

35:07.872 --> 35:09.774
Two former FSB agents
working for Russian oil

35:09.774 --> 35:11.109
have infiltrated the hotel.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.211
An imposter's here
to try to take you out.

35:13.211 --> 35:14.546
I don't understand.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.414
Cole, what are you
talking about?

35:16.414 --> 35:17.782
She's going by the name
Grace Stevenson.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.751
If you walk through that door,
she's gonna kill you.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.220
Barrett, is there any legitimacy
to this threat?

35:22.220 --> 35:26.558
No, nothing this man
says is legitimate.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.327
Good. Keep your men on alert.
I'm not letting this fall apart

35:29.327 --> 35:31.529
for nothing.
No, Senator,
you're making a mistake.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.967
Sorry about this, guys.

35:41.873 --> 35:45.143
Sorry, Senator.
You're coming with me.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.177
What?
Cole,

35:46.177 --> 35:47.445
are you seriously kidnapping
my mother right now?

35:47.445 --> 35:48.680
Technically, yes.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.990
Hey!
Hey, hold it right there!

36:00.025 --> 36:02.694
I can't believe
that this is happening.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.229
This is insane. You're insane.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.297
No one believed me.
What choice did I have?

36:06.297 --> 36:08.667
You could not kidnap a senator.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.968
Detective, never in my life...

36:09.968 --> 36:12.170
Sorry to interrupt you, Senator,
but when these doors open,

36:12.170 --> 36:13.705
somebody may be there
to arrest me

36:13.705 --> 36:15.040
or shoot me.
Either way, Erica,

36:15.040 --> 36:16.674
you may never want
to talk to me again,

36:16.674 --> 36:18.710
so this is my last chance.
There's a few things

36:18.710 --> 36:19.978
that I want you to know.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.414
I was in the CIA,
did a lot that I'm proud of,

36:22.414 --> 36:24.282
and a lot
that I'm not.

36:24.282 --> 36:25.683
I have a daughter
that I love

36:25.683 --> 36:27.118
more than anything in the world,

36:27.118 --> 36:28.820
an ex that I have
some history with.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.322
Let's see, what else?

36:31.322 --> 36:32.290
Sometimes I snore.

36:32.290 --> 36:35.593
I always leave my door
unlocked accidentally.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.062
Never been in a real
long-term relationship.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.530
And I hate mushrooms on pizza.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.533
Why are you telling me
all of this?

36:41.533 --> 36:44.903
I don't know.
Guess I'm leaning in.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.573
Hands up now.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.275
Senator, come with me.

36:55.246 --> 36:56.714
Move,

36:56.714 --> 36:58.283
or I shoot through you.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.888
Get out of here! Go!

37:03.888 --> 37:05.190
Go!

38:11.523 --> 38:14.025
I'll just take the next one.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.632
I should get going.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.834
Barrett gets pissy
when we're behind schedule.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.169
Honestly, not our worst visit.

38:24.169 --> 38:27.639
Far from it. And you really
dodged a bullet with that Cole.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.674
Yeah, he's a lunatic.

38:29.674 --> 38:31.609
What was all that stuff about
in the elevator?

38:31.609 --> 38:33.711
Oh, that was probably
for my benefit.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.313
When I spoke with him...
Wait.

38:35.313 --> 38:39.117
You spoke with him?
Only on your behalf.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.653
I know his type.
He's not for us.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.954
Mom, that's a total violation.

38:42.954 --> 38:47.058
You are my daughter,
and you should be thanking me.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.259
He is troubled,

38:48.259 --> 38:49.727
reckless...
He saved your life.

38:49.727 --> 38:53.731
And I think he was going
for a big gesture.

38:53.731 --> 38:54.666
Oh, please.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.701
That may work on other girls,

38:56.701 --> 38:58.536
but my daughter
is far too sensible

38:58.536 --> 39:00.839
to throw her life away
on a gesture.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.409
Now walk me to my car.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.947
Okay.

39:13.484 --> 39:17.488
I-I can't believe they kicked us
out of the hotel a day early.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.857
Well, apparently
your mother

39:18.857 --> 39:21.159
made quite the impression
last night.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.160
Okay.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.128
Oh, my gosh,
please, my skull.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.129
I'm sorry.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.799
Roger.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.801
But, Dad, you saved
a senator's life.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.036
Yeah, you're like
a real-life Tom Clancy hero.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.105
Yeah, well,
you're right, son,

39:34.105 --> 39:37.375
but, uh, it seems the manager
cares less about that

39:37.375 --> 39:39.310
and more about
his carpets.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.778
TRISH:
Okay, listen.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.715
I just wanted to make memories
with my kids

39:43.715 --> 39:45.183
before they leave me forever.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.518
Is that too much to ask for?

39:47.518 --> 39:49.254
Mom, if last night is any proof,

39:49.254 --> 39:52.257
we're never gonna stop making
memories on family vacations.

39:52.257 --> 39:53.725
ROGER JR.:
I mean, yeah, you still

39:53.725 --> 39:55.360
have to plan 'em.
We're hopeless.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.028
You're just saying that.

39:57.028 --> 40:01.532
No, like, I-I can, I can barely,
uh, do my laundry, actually.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.935
Yes, I've seen the
skid marks to prove it.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.371
Wow, you gonna, you gonna
bust me out like that?

40:06.371 --> 40:08.006
:
Come here.

40:08.006 --> 40:11.142
I love my hopeless kids.
I really do.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.212
You know what, it's a shame
that we're finally excited

40:14.212 --> 40:16.547
about vacation, and it's over.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.683
Yeah, well,
it doesn't have to be.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.319
Baby, we've got nowhere to go.

40:21.319 --> 40:24.756
Oh, maybe this, uh, hero

40:24.756 --> 40:27.892
could save the day once again.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.102
Oh, poolside service.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.737
It's not paddleboarding,

40:39.737 --> 40:40.938
but I'll take it.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.240
Thank you for
letting us

40:42.240 --> 40:43.908
crash your pool.

40:43.908 --> 40:47.378
We're partners, Roger. Partners
have each other's backs.

40:47.378 --> 40:50.315
Yeah, just like you should've
had mine at the hotel,

40:50.315 --> 40:52.517
because I was right.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.652
Yeah, like that's never
gonna get old.

40:54.652 --> 40:58.523
You said I could gloat.
I'm going to milk it.

41:01.726 --> 41:02.960
Hey, you better get that.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.396
And if you need me,
I got your back,

41:05.396 --> 41:08.199
just like you should've
had mine, but you didn't.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.301
Yeah. Yep.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.870
Erica, hey.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.539
Do you have the incident report
from the hotel?

41:14.539 --> 41:15.840
I need it to complete
the case file.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.476
Oh, so that's why
you're calling?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.744
Why else would I be calling?

41:19.744 --> 41:22.280
In the past two days,
you called my mom a prostitute,

41:22.280 --> 41:23.715
kidnapped her, ran her over,

41:23.715 --> 41:25.783
and confessed some intimate,
confusing details.

told me he forgets
