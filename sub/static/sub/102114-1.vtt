00:12.011 --> 00:13.472
I can

00:12.011 --> 00:13.472
almost guarantee you,

00:13.514 --> 00:15.098
at some point in your life,

00:15.140 --> 00:17.685
you will be asked

00:15.140 --> 00:17.685
the following question:

00:18.352 --> 00:19.979
Do you believe in God?

00:20.020 --> 00:24.608
Now for me, the answer

00:20.020 --> 00:24.608
is undoubtedly, yes.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.610
How did I come to

00:24.650 --> 00:26.610
that conclusion?

00:26.652 --> 00:32.908
Well, it involves some faith,

00:26.652 --> 00:32.908
some hope and some love.

00:32.950 --> 00:36.787
Oh, yeah.

00:32.950 --> 00:36.787
And some dancing.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.455
What, you don't believe me?

00:38.497 --> 00:42.501
Sit back, 'cause we

Well, is everything all right?

02:17.054 --> 02:19.848
I'm fine. I'm just

02:17.054 --> 02:19.848
worried about my dad.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.434
Well, he seems okay to me.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.437
Big doll, hey,

02:23.560 --> 02:25.437
hit me one time.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.230
Over here.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.230
Time is running out.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.149
Oh, he's gonna pass!

02:29.190 --> 02:30.525
Oh, yeah, I guess I

02:29.190 --> 02:30.525
wasn't too good, was it?

02:32.694 --> 02:37.365
I woke up on Sunday and

02:32.694 --> 02:37.365
saw him crying downstairs.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.995
That was your mom's

02:37.407 --> 02:40.995
three-year memorial service.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.204
I've seen him cry

02:41.036 --> 02:43.204
other times too.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.499
Well, you want

02:43.246 --> 02:45.499
me to talk to him?

02:45.540 --> 02:48.167
No, I need you to talk to God.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.545
Well, what would you

02:48.209 --> 02:50.545
like me to tell God?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.631
Well, this studio I dance at

02:52.673 --> 02:54.008
is having a fundraiser tonight.

02:54.049 --> 02:57.344
It's for a pro and

02:54.049 --> 02:57.344
schmo dance contest.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.804
I want my dad to enter.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.473
So you want your father

02:58.846 --> 03:01.473
to enter this contest

03:01.515 --> 03:03.809
so he starts to

03:01.515 --> 03:03.809
get out a bit, huh?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.561
Well, yeah, and

03:03.851 --> 03:06.561
my dance instructor

03:06.603 --> 03:09.314
would be the person

03:06.603 --> 03:09.314
he'd be dancing with.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.608
I think he'd be happy

03:09.356 --> 03:11.608
if he gets to know her.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.235
I'll say a prayer,

03:11.650 --> 03:14.235
and we'll leave

03:14.277 --> 03:18.365
everything else up to God, okay?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.325
Hey, hon, I was

03:18.406 --> 03:20.325
wondering where you went.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.618
Ah, she's all set.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.996
Okay, come on sweetie.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.790
Everything okay?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.337
Hey, hey, gang.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.505
Sorry, I can't make it tonight.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.256
I gotta go

03:33.547 --> 03:35.256
to a school fundraiser.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.385
You know, I'm not

03:35.298 --> 03:38.385
keeping track or anything,

03:38.426 --> 03:42.222
but you missed the last

03:38.426 --> 03:42.222
two days of Bible studies.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.891
How would you know, Harry?

03:43.932 --> 03:45.142
We didn't go either.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.728
Ah, I got my

03:45.184 --> 03:47.728
sources, people talk.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.605
All right, Mr. Keratas.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.605
I'll make sure I'm

03:47.769 --> 03:50.605
here next week, okay?

03:50.647 --> 03:52.900
Just saying.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.028
He keeps attendance.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.612
All right, all right.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.198
Who was that?

03:59.239 --> 04:04.036
♪ I must confess

03:59.239 --> 04:04.036
when our world is stressed ♪

04:04.078 --> 04:06.287
♪ I feel like dancing ♪

04:06.329 --> 04:08.623
♪ The whole night with you ♪

04:08.665 --> 04:11.960
♪ And when I do,

04:08.665 --> 04:11.960
do, do, do, do, do ♪

04:12.002 --> 04:15.923
So, I hear your studio

04:12.002 --> 04:15.923
needs to be rescued.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.339
Well, we have to

04:15.964 --> 04:17.339
get the building

04:17.382 --> 04:19.718
retrofitted or the city

04:17.382 --> 04:19.718
will close us down.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.596
If we win the contest,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.596
the $25,000 will help us

04:22.637 --> 04:24.098
retrofit the building.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.517
So, you and me tangoing

04:24.139 --> 04:27.517
for a couple of months.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.728
Practicing.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.774
Whatever anyone bids, put

04:29.770 --> 04:33.774
me down for 100 over it.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.400
Mm-hmm.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.489
- Hi.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.489
- It's Gerald Hogwood II.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.908
He's Daddy Hog One.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.534
- Hi.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.534
- Howdy.

04:44.576 --> 04:48.496
Yeah, I'm his Daddy

04:44.576 --> 04:48.496
and his dance advisor.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.499
Why don't you show her

04:48.538 --> 04:51.499
a little something, Hog II.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.668
Okay, check this out.

04:53.710 --> 04:57.214
It's like 180 degrees,

04:53.710 --> 04:57.214
that split right there.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.550
Left leg pointing

04:57.256 --> 05:00.550
towards Los Angeles,

05:00.592 --> 05:02.510
right foot to New York.

05:02.552 --> 05:08.100
Grand plie, whoa, whoa, didn't

05:02.552 --> 05:08.100
even spill a drop of wine.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.643
- Yeah.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.228
- Okay.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.228
- And we've got

05:11.270 --> 05:14.022
killer choreography.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.149
Great, thank you.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.233
Thank you so much.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.652
- Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.652
- Hello.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.862
- I'm Jimmy Elpidas.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.862
- Hi.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.031
I'm Demetra and Gia's dad.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.324
Right, right, I'm Faith.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.659
Oh, nice to meet you.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.035
I think I've waved

05:25.700 --> 05:27.035
to you a couple times

05:27.077 --> 05:29.454
when I drop them off

05:27.077 --> 05:29.454
at their classes.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.581
Demetra wanted me

05:29.496 --> 05:31.581
to sign up for this.

05:31.623 --> 05:32.666
So I'm, you know...

05:32.707 --> 05:33.875
She's a wonderful girl.

05:33.917 --> 05:34.960
- Ah, thank you.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.588
Oh, guess dinner's starting.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.923
Anyway, good luck with this.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.424
- Thank you.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.424
- Oh.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.678
You came to wife's

05:42.634 --> 05:44.678
funeral, didn't you?

05:44.719 --> 05:48.473
I did, I was

05:44.719 --> 05:48.473
sorry for your loss.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.808
Thank you, it was

05:48.515 --> 05:49.808
very kind of you.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.769
I meant to write you

05:49.850 --> 05:52.769
a note, but just...

05:52.811 --> 05:55.814
It was a beautiful

05:52.811 --> 05:55.814
service, so...

05:55.856 --> 05:57.524
Anyway, good luck.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.942
Thank you.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.867
You got it.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.124
Gia, it's daddy.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.626
I need to finish

06:14.166 --> 06:16.626
proofing my personal statement.

06:16.668 --> 06:20.672
No, no, come on, go

06:16.668 --> 06:20.672
to bed, I'll do it for you.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.633
Hi, Daddy, did

06:20.714 --> 06:23.633
you win the prize?

06:23.675 --> 06:25.844
Ah, no, I didn't, honey.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.264
I tried, but somebody

06:25.886 --> 06:29.264
else beat me out for it.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.226
No, no, that's not the way

06:29.306 --> 06:32.226
it was supposed to happen.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.102
Come on, get some sleep, okay?

06:36.437 --> 06:39.316
Good night, you guys.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.316
I love you.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.073
All right.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.914
A little tweaking

06:50.451 --> 06:53.914
won't hurt, would it?

06:56.624 --> 06:59.711
Gia, let's go, we're

06:56.624 --> 06:59.711
gonna be late for school.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.714
I don't even know

06:59.753 --> 07:02.714
why I try putting it on.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.714
I hate my makeup.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.550
Ah, good morning, Gia.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.052
All right, guys, come on.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.929
Quick prayer before we go.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.639
Hold on.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.893
Yeah. Really?

07:16.019 --> 07:17.396
Oh, okay.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.107
Yeah, yeah, I know,

07:17.437 --> 07:20.107
thanks, thanks.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.110
Who was that?

07:23.151 --> 07:26.446
The guy who won

07:23.151 --> 07:26.446
the dance contest.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.446
His wife told him that

07:26.487 --> 07:30.200
she didn't want him being in

07:26.487 --> 07:30.200
it, so he had to give it back.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.993
So who won it then?

07:32.869 --> 07:34.662
They're gonna

07:32.869 --> 07:34.662
have a dance-off

07:34.704 --> 07:37.457
tomorrow between me

07:34.704 --> 07:37.457
and the other guy,

07:37.498 --> 07:39.084
that were the two top bidders.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.379
I can't believe I'm a senior,

07:42.421 --> 07:44.256
and you're still

07:42.421 --> 07:44.256
dropping me off.

07:44.298 --> 07:48.468
Ooh, there's Gia's boyfriend.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.887
- Don't.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.887
- Oh, really?

07:50.929 --> 07:52.472
- Goodbye, Dad.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.472
- Oh, my gosh.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.932
Hello, George.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.684
- Hello, George.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.684
- Stop!

07:58.019 --> 07:59.938
Bye. Anybody say

07:58.019 --> 07:59.938
I love you to Dad?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.149
No, no, they forget

07:59.980 --> 08:02.149
that I guess, okay.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.319
Bye, sweetie.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.823
Every morning

08:08.280 --> 08:09.823
at drop-off,

08:09.864 --> 08:11.616
I watch a beautiful ballet,

08:11.658 --> 08:14.077
where the ballerinas

08:11.658 --> 08:14.077
are the mothers.

08:14.119 --> 08:19.291
With tenderness, love

08:14.119 --> 08:19.291
and grace, they move

08:14.119 --> 08:19.291
across the parking lot.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.667
As they remember lunches,

08:20.708 --> 08:23.586
tuck away homework

08:20.708 --> 08:23.586
and dispense love.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.046
Yes, father's do their part,

08:25.088 --> 08:29.134
but it's the mothers

08:25.088 --> 08:29.134
who are the stars.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.886
They know the steps.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.640
They hear the music.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.183
They don't miss a beat.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.686
I miss my ballerina.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.774
It's me.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.651
I can see you. You don't

08:44.816 --> 08:46.651
need to pound like that.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.653
I'm sorry, you ready?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.613
- For what?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.613
- For the presentation?

08:50.655 --> 08:52.073
What?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.325
That's Thursday, isn't it?

08:53.367 --> 08:54.868
Oh, my gosh, Jimmy,

08:53.367 --> 08:54.868
are you kidding?

08:54.909 --> 08:56.619
Oh, no, I'll get it changed.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.787
I've done it before,

08:56.661 --> 08:57.787
no worries, no worries.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.997
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.332
Okay, come on, let's go.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.084
All right then, anybody else?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.794
- Yeah.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.794
- Jimmy?

09:04.836 --> 09:07.630
Can we move the Crown Guitar

09:04.836 --> 09:07.630
presentation to next week?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.883
The date's already

09:07.672 --> 09:09.883
been moved, thank you.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.510
Oh, cool.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.803
So unless there's

09:11.551 --> 09:13.803
anything else, anybody?

09:13.845 --> 09:14.804
No?

09:14.846 --> 09:15.972
All right, thank you.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.641
- All right.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.641
- Thank you.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.809
Uh, Jimmy.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.728
You wanna hang

09:19.851 --> 09:21.728
back for a minute?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.397
Yeah.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.774
- What's up?

09:24.814 --> 09:26.774
- All right, listen.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.445
Look, I've taken

09:26.816 --> 09:30.445
a look at your numbers,

09:30.487 --> 09:36.368
and the... well, the truth is,

09:30.487 --> 09:36.368
you haven't made your numbers

09:36.410 --> 09:37.869
for the last couple of years.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.330
Your quota's way down,

09:37.911 --> 09:40.330
and you're even messing up

09:40.372 --> 09:42.040
the bloopers that

09:40.372 --> 09:42.040
I've been giving you.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.833
I am super appreciative

09:42.082 --> 09:43.833
of everything

09:43.875 --> 09:45.835
that you've done around here.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.212
But?

09:47.962 --> 09:49.423
But I have to let you go.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.132
- What?

09:51.174 --> 09:52.759
You need to let me go?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.678
I've been here 22 years,

09:52.800 --> 09:55.678
Brian, you're gonna let me go?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.139
Security will walk

09:55.720 --> 09:58.139
you to your desk.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.561
And you're gonna make me

10:00.517 --> 10:02.561
do a perp walk on top of it?

10:02.602 --> 10:05.272
- It's protocol.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.272
- Are you kidding me?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.107
Really, Brian, really?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.119
Good afternoon,

10:17.867 --> 10:19.119
how can I direct your call?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.329
- Brian, Brian.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.329
- Ah, come on, Jimmy.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.331
Come on, what are

10:21.371 --> 10:23.331
you doing here?

10:23.373 --> 10:24.541
Give me one more chance.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.626
I don't have anymore chances.

10:26.667 --> 10:30.088
Look, I know I haven't been

10:26.667 --> 10:30.088
on top of my game lately.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.799
on top of your game?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.510
You haven't been in

10:32.840 --> 10:35.510
the game for years.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.305
Look, man, we all feel bad

10:35.552 --> 10:38.305
about what happened to Debbie,

10:38.346 --> 10:39.556
but that was three years ago.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.058
Three years, Jim.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.393
Give me one account.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.186
- I can't.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.186
- Anything.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.854
Jimmy, come on.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.649
I got two girls, okay?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.736
Give me your worst account.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.905
The worst account,

10:53.778 --> 10:55.905
if I don't make the sale,

10:55.947 --> 10:58.199
you get rid of me,

10:55.947 --> 10:58.199
no questions asked.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.661
- You're not gonna like it.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.661
- Try me.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.538
- Soul 2Soul.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.538
- Ugh, I hate it.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.664
Of course you do.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.166
It's a dating website, me?

11:06.207 --> 11:09.294
After our last presentation,

11:06.207 --> 11:09.294
they canceled on us.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.962
It's all I got.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.048
You get them to come back in

11:11.004 --> 11:14.048
here, commit to a campaign,

11:14.090 --> 11:16.884
and we can talk about

11:14.090 --> 11:16.884
your future around here.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.845
That's it.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.054
- Brian.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.054
- It's a take it

11:20.096 --> 11:22.516
- or leave it, Jim.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.516
- Okay.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.271
- Demetra, what's up?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.271
- Daddy, where are you?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.772
I'm at work, what's going on?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.442
Did you forget the dance-off?

11:33.151 --> 11:34.777
Oh, no, no, okay.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.280
I'll be right there, sweetie,

11:34.819 --> 11:37.280
I'll be right there.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.906
Hurry, the other guy

11:37.322 --> 11:38.906
is starting,

11:38.948 --> 11:40.325
and he looks really prepared.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.453
All right, show

11:40.367 --> 11:43.453
'em the magic, son.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.622
- Jimmy?

11:44.078 --> 11:45.622
- Yeah.

11:45.664 --> 11:46.914
I'm Coretta, go on it.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.458
Okay, thanks.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.253
Really?

11:52.295 --> 11:53.712
Really?

11:53.754 --> 11:54.631
Come on, man, come on.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.341
The show already began.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.052
I lost my concentration.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.094
I'm gonna take it from the top.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.263
Okay.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.058
You know, I've

12:02.305 --> 12:05.058
seen Baryshnikov

12:02.305 --> 12:05.058
stop a ballet dead in

12:05.099 --> 12:09.020
its tracks because somebody

12:05.099 --> 12:09.020
in the audience sneezed.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.689
Don't be the sneeze.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.401
Papa, cue music.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.070
♪ You don't know ♪

12:17.111 --> 12:20.365
Come on, come on.

12:20.407 --> 12:25.953
♪ Whoa, whoa ♪

12:28.415 --> 12:31.334
♪ What I need ♪

12:31.376 --> 12:34.504
♪ What I need ♪

12:36.839 --> 12:38.174
Get it up.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.594
Whoa, yeah.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.022
No, not yet!

12:54.982 --> 12:56.276
Oh, yes!

12:56.317 --> 12:58.069
Oh, they don't make

12:56.317 --> 12:58.069
'em like that anymore.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.946
- Good luck topping that.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.946
- Ooh, yeah.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.740
Wow, that's

12:59.987 --> 13:01.740
a tough act to follow.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.742
Um, I didn't bring any music.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.034
Amateur.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.785
For the competition,

13:05.076 --> 13:06.785
the partners cannot have

13:06.827 --> 13:09.456
had any prior dance

13:06.827 --> 13:09.456
experience, okay?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.916
I have no prior

13:09.497 --> 13:11.916
dance experience.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.336
Although, in college, they

13:11.958 --> 13:15.336
did call me Funkenstein.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.171
Frankenstein, you mean?

13:17.213 --> 13:19.257
No, no, no, Funkenstein.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.884
But everyone thought

13:19.299 --> 13:21.884
that I was Jewish,

13:19.299 --> 13:21.884
Everyone, I'm Greek,

13:21.926 --> 13:25.263
and so they called me Stein.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.263
And then I took second place

13:25.305 --> 13:26.847
in my fraternity dance contest.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.892
So they started calling me

13:26.889 --> 13:29.892
"funk" and "stein," Funkenstein.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.019
That's a great story, can

13:29.934 --> 13:32.019
you tell it again longer?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.063
Okay, listen, I just

13:32.061 --> 13:34.063
need to see how you move.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.898
Okay, let 'er rip.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.197
Hey, Baryshnikov.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.868
How about the twist?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.245
The twist.

13:50.913 --> 13:54.167
Good, anything else?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.210
Anybody remember

13:54.208 --> 13:56.210
the Charleston?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.086
My dead grandmother.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.546
Grandma's dead?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.507
- You stay focused.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.507
- Yeah.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.383
Who remembers this bad boy?

14:03.134 --> 14:04.636
Oh.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.095
Have you got any kicks?

14:06.137 --> 14:07.930
I got kicks all day long.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.930
Are you kidding me?

14:07.972 --> 14:10.057
Ho, hey, ho.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.726
I'm like a regular Rockette.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.729
- Sorry.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.729
- That was on purpose.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.230
It was intentional.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.108
- Back here, stay focused.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.108
- It was premeditated.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.401
Okay, are you okay?

14:20.443 --> 14:22.945
Crud, crud, yeah,

14:20.443 --> 14:22.945
just a little cramp.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.573
Okay, um, all right.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.992
Listen up, guys,

14:25.615 --> 14:27.992
this is my decision.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.787
Will you accept this rose?

14:31.954 --> 14:33.456
- Thank you.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.456
- That's very nice of you.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.833
Thank you.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.585
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.963
They're gonna become great

14:37.627 --> 14:40.963
dance partners and fall in love.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.299
Thank you.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.885
Dad, can I have a sleepover

14:43.341 --> 14:45.885
at the Henderlinds tomorrow?

14:45.926 --> 14:47.053
Oh, honey, you know the rules.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.179
No sleepovers.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.597
Everyone does sleepovers.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.266
You're the strictest parent.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.938
Aw, man.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.945
How am I doing?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.117
Man.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.370
You made it all look so easy.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.376
I'm in trouble at work.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.506
I don't feel it anymore.

15:35.769 --> 15:36.977
I miss you.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.913
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.040
You're not gonna do that,

15:54.954 --> 15:58.040
you're not gonna do that.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.381
Hey, morning, Jimmy.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.381
Are you hurt?

16:05.423 --> 16:07.425
Oh, no, I think I

16:05.423 --> 16:07.425
just pulled something.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.676
Doing what?

16:08.718 --> 16:09.552
Uh, squats.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.095
Squats, oh, not a fan.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.764
Yeah, I probably went

16:11.137 --> 16:12.764
a little too heavy.

16:12.806 --> 16:16.183
Hey, you start working

16:12.806 --> 16:16.183
on that Soul 2Soul ASAP,

16:16.225 --> 16:17.310
- you got it?

16:16.225 --> 16:17.310
- Yeah, yeah.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.812
I'm totally focused on it.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.527
Hey, Coretta.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.821
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.782
And she's finishing

16:27.862 --> 16:30.782
up her last class.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.283
Oh, okay.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.327
You know, if you ever

16:32.325 --> 16:34.327
get here before she does,

16:34.368 --> 16:37.747
there's a key under

16:34.368 --> 16:37.747
the mat in the front.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.040
All right, thank you.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.335
Who's that?

16:42.376 --> 16:45.171
Ben, her ex.

16:45.212 --> 16:48.633
Great dancer, lousy husband.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.552
You know,

16:49.550 --> 16:51.552
when they got divorced,

16:51.594 --> 16:54.722
the only thing she asked

16:51.594 --> 16:54.722
for was this studio.

16:54.764 --> 16:59.894
The most important thing that

16:54.764 --> 16:59.894
I will ever, ever teach you

16:59.936 --> 17:04.607
is to let the pure joy,

16:59.936 --> 17:04.607
the happiness, the heartache,

17:04.648 --> 17:08.234
the sorrow, whatever you

17:04.648 --> 17:08.234
are feeling for that day,

17:08.277 --> 17:11.906
pour out of your souls

17:08.277 --> 17:11.906
when you dance.

17:11.948 --> 17:17.203
Because that is

17:11.948 --> 17:17.203
why we dance, okay?

17:17.243 --> 17:19.664
Now, did everybody bring

17:17.243 --> 17:19.664
their sunglasses today.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.875
Yeah!

17:21.915 --> 17:23.209
Get those shades

17:21.915 --> 17:23.209
ready, ladies.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.795
We are going across the floor.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.719
Once a week we cut loose.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.804
It's kinda my favorite day.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.931
Cool shirt.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.891
- Oh.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.891
- What do you letters mean?

18:19.933 --> 18:21.642
Uh...

18:23.185 --> 18:25.438
This changed the world.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.230
Seriously?

18:26.272 --> 18:27.690
- Yeah.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.690
- Okay.

18:27.732 --> 18:28.900
Do you wanna

18:27.732 --> 18:28.900
know what it means?

18:28.942 --> 18:30.317
No, no, no,

18:28.942 --> 18:30.317
I'll figure it out.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.236
- I'll figure it out.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.236
All right.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.030
Okay, so this is how

18:32.278 --> 18:34.030
the competition works.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.322
All right.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.950
Each couple submits

18:35.364 --> 18:36.950
their best dance.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.118
Off-tape the judges narrow

18:36.991 --> 18:39.118
it down to ten couples,

18:39.159 --> 18:40.661
and they'll dance

18:39.159 --> 18:40.661
the finals live.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.288
- Okay.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.288
- Okay?

18:42.329 --> 18:44.958
Typically the man leads,

18:42.329 --> 18:44.958
but given you're the schmo

18:44.999 --> 18:47.001
in the partnership,

18:44.999 --> 18:47.001
I'll be doing the leading.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.294
All right.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.254
Is that hard for you to do?

18:50.296 --> 18:53.758
No, not at all. I always lead

18:50.296 --> 18:53.758
every one of my partners.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.842
Okay.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.428
- So do you feel this?

18:54.884 --> 18:57.428
- Yeah.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.888
That's how I'm

18:57.470 --> 18:58.888
gonna be leading you.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.139
- Okay.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.139
- It's that push and pull.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.058
- Okay.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.393
Now, let's start with

19:02.100 --> 19:04.393
some basic moves, okay?

19:04.435 --> 19:06.479
- Very, very basic.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.479
- All right.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.439
This is called a pique turn.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.816
Pique turn.

19:12.777 --> 19:13.903
- Okay, I can give that a shot.

19:12.777 --> 19:13.903
- Okay?

19:13.945 --> 19:15.113
I'll give it a shot.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.697
- I'll give it a shot.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.697
- Have a go.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.740
No pressure.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.160
Posture, elbow.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.703
Posture, elbow, okay.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.625
How was that?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.002
Good, you know.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.545
- Honestly?

19:29.043 --> 19:31.545
- Horrible.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.465
- Oh, gee, that looks ominous.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.465
- Okay, this is going

19:34.507 --> 19:36.092
to help with your posture.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.468
All right.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.929
Um, up and over, okay.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.766
I feel like a scarecrow.

19:43.808 --> 19:44.934
Well, we'll need

19:43.808 --> 19:44.934
to get you into

19:44.976 --> 19:47.895
some tight clothing too, okay?

19:47.937 --> 19:50.815
You know, I'm kinda a

19:47.937 --> 19:50.815
sweatshirts and jeans kinda guy.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.442
Well, the judges like

19:50.857 --> 19:53.442
to see clean lines, so...

19:53.484 --> 19:54.986
All right.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.279
How do you feel about

19:55.028 --> 19:57.279
taking some ballet classes?

19:57.321 --> 20:00.449
Yeah, I'm gonna be

19:57.321 --> 20:00.449
totally honest with you.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.201
I'm not gonna take

20:00.491 --> 20:02.201
ballet classes.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.579
I'm probably never gonna

20:02.242 --> 20:05.579
wear this thing, you know?

20:05.621 --> 20:06.956
Anything else?

20:06.998 --> 20:11.460
Uh, no spray tans

20:06.998 --> 20:11.460
and none of those,

20:11.502 --> 20:13.462
you know, butt shakin'

20:11.502 --> 20:13.462
moves that you guys do.

20:13.504 --> 20:18.384
Hey, I won many a contest

20:13.504 --> 20:18.384
with those butt shaking moves.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.428
So what's your favorite dance?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.389
I love them all, you know,

20:21.470 --> 20:23.389
when I can do it.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.391
Really, oh, that's impressive.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.936
Okay, whatever dance we do,

20:25.432 --> 20:28.936
you have to sell it.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.022
The judges love the push

20:28.978 --> 20:31.022
and the pull of the dance.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.648
- Uh-huh.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.648
- Okay?

20:32.690 --> 20:35.234
So that means that we get close,

20:35.275 --> 20:37.444
we go apart, we get close again.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.072
Oh.

20:39.864 --> 20:40.865
That is close.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.241
That's the whole point of it.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.411
Dancers get close,

20:42.282 --> 20:45.411
but we never kiss.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.621
The judges love it.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.957
We're gonna get higher scores.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.751
You just gotta

20:49.999 --> 20:51.751
really sell it, okay?

20:51.792 --> 20:54.545
Just give a little

20:51.792 --> 20:54.545
bang, pow, what!

20:54.587 --> 20:56.005
You know what I mean?

20:56.047 --> 20:57.215
Bang, pow, what.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.549
Yeah, okay, hold on, hold on.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.885
You know, I think,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.885
with all this stuff,

21:00.927 --> 21:03.554
it's just kinda like

21:00.927 --> 21:03.554
a little information overload.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.513
Okay, all right.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.806
- Maybe.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.806
- Well, let's take

21:05.848 --> 21:07.391
- a dinner break.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.391
- Yeah, let's do that.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.143
- And I'll go over

21:07.433 --> 21:09.143
everything with you.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.143
- Okay.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.354
Okay, so I think

21:09.185 --> 21:12.354
the IC on your shirt

21:12.396 --> 21:15.191
is roman numerals for 101.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.650
Am I right?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.860
You're not even close.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.196
- You're not even close.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.196
- Come on.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.948
Okay, I'll figure it out.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.116
But first thing's first.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.158
- Okay.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.158
- We need to come up with

21:24.200 --> 21:25.659
a great team name.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.120
Okay.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.538
Next, we need to practice

21:27.161 --> 21:29.538
as much as possible.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.707
So, what's your schedule like?

21:31.749 --> 21:36.503
Uh, well, every Friday I

21:31.749 --> 21:36.503
have Bible study, and then Gia

21:36.545 --> 21:39.090
has prom next month,

21:36.545 --> 21:39.090
so that'll be kinda busy.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.841
Oh, that'll be so much fun.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.303
I never went to my prom.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.638
Really, why not?

21:45.679 --> 21:49.516
I had issues and kinda

21:45.679 --> 21:49.516
wasn't meant to be.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.685
But actually, they

21:49.558 --> 21:51.685
just announced

21:51.727 --> 21:54.147
the high school reunion

21:51.727 --> 21:54.147
is gonna be next month.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.439
Oh, cool.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.276
But I'm probably

21:55.481 --> 21:58.276
not gonna go though.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.610
Why not?

21:59.652 --> 22:02.613
Bad memories.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.613
There was this girl Susie,

22:02.655 --> 22:05.491
and she made my life hell

22:02.655 --> 22:05.491
in high school.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.911
She was on the dance squad.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.911
I got cut from the dance squad,

22:08.953 --> 22:12.456
so she just always thought she

22:08.953 --> 22:12.456
was a better dancer than me.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.874
Hmm.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.460
Anyway, what's

22:13.916 --> 22:16.460
your work schedule like?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.629
Uh, well, I just

22:16.502 --> 22:18.629
got this huge new

22:18.671 --> 22:21.257
client presentation

22:18.671 --> 22:21.257
I gotta work on.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.591
Oh, what's it for?

22:22.633 --> 22:26.012
It's a dating website

22:22.633 --> 22:26.012
called Soul 2Soul.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.596
Oh, I've never

22:26.053 --> 22:27.596
heard of that one,

22:27.638 --> 22:29.307
and I'm on every single site.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.225
You're on every

22:29.347 --> 22:31.225
dating website?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.435
Mm-hmm.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.437
I got divorced a year ago.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.316
So I thought I should

22:35.479 --> 22:38.316
get back out there.

22:38.356 --> 22:39.525
Oh, good for you.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.401
Any... any luck?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.821
Well, I get asked out

22:41.443 --> 22:43.821
on a lot of first dates

22:43.863 --> 22:46.699
but not a lot of second dates.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.451
I am just horrible at dating.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.122
And I'm super shy.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.748
But you know the problem

22:53.164 --> 22:54.748
with dating websites?

22:54.790 --> 22:56.292
What's that?

22:56.334 --> 22:59.461
They never really let

22:56.334 --> 22:59.461
you get to know the person.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.505
It's all about checking

22:59.503 --> 23:01.505
a ton of boxes,

23:01.547 --> 23:04.591
and what they should have

23:01.547 --> 23:04.591
are videos of the people,

23:04.633 --> 23:06.969
you know, answering

23:04.633 --> 23:06.969
questions about themselves.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.096
Hm, thank you.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.472
Not a bad idea.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.474
Do you mind if I

23:10.514 --> 23:12.474
say a quick prayer?

23:12.516 --> 23:15.061
Oh, no, go ahead.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.146
Heavenly Father, we

23:15.102 --> 23:17.146
thank you for this food,

23:17.188 --> 23:19.899
and Lord, I thank you for

23:17.188 --> 23:19.899
this fellowship with Faith,

23:19.940 --> 23:22.026
and in particular, Father,

23:19.940 --> 23:22.026
I ask that whatever's

23:22.068 --> 23:24.695
on Faith's heart

23:22.068 --> 23:24.695
that you grant it.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.199
In your son's name I pray, amen.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.408
Did I just totally

23:28.241 --> 23:30.408
mess that up?

23:30.450 --> 23:31.827
What?

23:31.869 --> 23:33.913
Was I meant to hold your

23:31.869 --> 23:33.913
hands during the prayer?

23:33.954 --> 23:35.581
Oh, no, no, no.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.334
See, some of my friends,

23:35.622 --> 23:38.334
when we pray, they hold hands.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.627
Some don't. I never know

23:38.376 --> 23:40.627
which it's gonna be,

23:40.669 --> 23:43.172
so I put my hands out

23:40.669 --> 23:43.172
there, duck the head,

23:43.214 --> 23:44.631
I don't know

23:43.214 --> 23:44.631
what's gonna happen.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.508
- I just...

23:44.673 --> 23:46.508
I just say the prayer.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.508
- Okay.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.719
Phew, okay, great. Yeah.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.763
No, no, you're fine,

23:48.761 --> 23:50.763
you're fine, enjoy your food.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.181
Thank you.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.689
Hey, hey, I came up

23:57.770 --> 24:00.689
with your team name.

24:00.731 --> 24:01.982
Okay.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.235
The Premonitions.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.694
The Premonitions?

24:05.736 --> 24:07.321
Like when you see the future?

24:07.363 --> 24:11.617
Yeah. Like when I was 19,

24:07.363 --> 24:11.617
I was gettin' my hair done,

24:11.658 --> 24:14.578
and the stylist told me

24:11.658 --> 24:14.578
that she had a premonition

24:14.620 --> 24:18.249
that one day a man

24:14.620 --> 24:18.249
would walk in the room

24:18.291 --> 24:23.212
and the moment I saw him,

24:18.291 --> 24:23.212
that I would pass out.

24:23.254 --> 24:27.007
And bam, it would be my husband.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.260
And?

24:29.302 --> 24:31.137
It never happened.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.680
Well, wait, wait, wait, I

24:31.178 --> 24:33.680
guess that was a bad example.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.683
But it would have

24:33.722 --> 24:36.683
been a premonition.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.436
The Premonitions.

24:38.476 --> 24:39.770
I'm gonna think

24:38.476 --> 24:39.770
about that one, Coretta.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.899
Hey, when you go to church

24:43.941 --> 24:45.609
and they say

24:43.941 --> 24:45.609
the word "fellowship,"

24:45.651 --> 24:47.320
what exactly does that mean?

24:47.361 --> 24:49.947
Well, it just means

24:47.361 --> 24:49.947
spending time together

24:49.989 --> 24:52.032
and forming friendships.

24:52.074 --> 24:55.661
- It doesn't mean, like,

24:52.074 --> 24:55.661
dating or anything, right?

24:52.074 --> 24:55.661
- Oh, no, no, no.

24:55.702 --> 24:58.622
I just don't wanna give Jimmy

24:55.702 --> 24:58.622
any mixed signals, you know?

24:58.664 --> 25:00.582
I don't need another

24:58.664 --> 25:00.582
dance romance.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.418
I know that's right.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.795
Well, well, why?

25:02.460 --> 25:04.795
What did Jimmy say?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.504
Well, he was

25:04.837 --> 25:06.504
praying before we ate,

25:06.546 --> 25:09.008
and he said something

25:06.546 --> 25:09.008
about fellowship

25:09.049 --> 25:11.927
and God helping me with

25:09.049 --> 25:11.927
whatever's on my heart.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.638
You know that

25:11.969 --> 25:14.638
voice inside you?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.349
Some people call it conscience.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.100
We call it God.

25:18.142 --> 25:21.937
And God puts something on

25:18.142 --> 25:21.937
your heart, and you know it's

25:21.979 --> 25:26.359
the right thing to do.

25:21.979 --> 25:26.359
But you may be afraid to do it.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.861
That's when something's

25:26.400 --> 25:28.861
on your heart.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.489
Okay, well, I just

25:28.902 --> 25:31.489
wanted to make sure.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.950
Well, now remember, you

25:31.529 --> 25:34.950
only have one month left

25:34.992 --> 25:37.244
to get your submission dance in.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.621
Okay, okay,

25:37.286 --> 25:39.621
I'm gonna get on that.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.003
No, you're right,

30:35.501 --> 30:38.003

30:47.053 --> 30:51.642
- No, no, we just wanna

30:47.053 --> 30:51.642
say a quick prayer.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.561
There's a passage in the Bible

30:51.684 --> 30:54.561
that says where two or more

30:54.603 --> 30:57.314
are gathered in his name,

30:54.603 --> 30:57.314
that he'll be there.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.024
So I figured we'd

30:57.356 --> 30:59.024
do quick prayer.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.192
Okay.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.847
for guidance at this moment

31:29.888 --> 31:31.890
as we're unclear what to do.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.812
Joshua 1:9, "Have I

31:33.141 --> 31:36.812
not commanded you to be

31:36.854 --> 31:38.564
strong and courageous?"

31:39.773 --> 31:41.900
I have no idea

31:39.773 --> 31:41.900
where that came from.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.161
Oh, look at Faith Turley

You two are probably

gonna get married.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.635
Her name is Coretta,

34:52.841 --> 34:55.635

34:52.841 --> 34:55.635
about you years ago.

You know, I'm

35:05.437 --> 35:06.479
Hit me one time.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.814
Hit me one time.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.405
Hi, Mr. Elpidas.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.574
I just wanted to go over

35:15.447 --> 35:17.574
Gia's personal statement

35:17.616 --> 35:19.618
for her college

35:17.616 --> 35:19.618
application with you.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.078
Oh, okay.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.788
First of all, Gia

35:21.119 --> 35:22.788
needs to explain

35:22.829 --> 35:26.416
why she got a C in

35:22.829 --> 35:26.416
geometry her freshman year.

35:26.458 --> 35:30.462
Wow, I think that's the only

35:26.458 --> 35:30.462
C she got in all high school.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.214
Top tier schools don't

35:30.503 --> 35:33.214
wanna see even one C.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.634
Okay.

35:35.675 --> 35:39.638
Also, some of this

35:35.675 --> 35:39.638
didn't sound like Gia.

35:43.850 --> 35:47.353
"When I ponder the awe-inspiring

35:43.850 --> 35:47.353
decision to attend college

35:47.395 --> 35:51.024
and consider the

35:47.395 --> 35:51.024
cataclysmic and deleterious

35:51.066 --> 35:54.444
possibilities, I am

35:51.066 --> 35:54.444
overwrought with consternation

35:54.486 --> 35:58.073
until I realize

35:54.486 --> 35:58.073
the euphoric journey I am on."

36:01.367 --> 36:04.704
Bro, come on.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.999
Dad, I'm so embarrassed.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.792
Why would you change

36:07.040 --> 36:08.792
my personal statement?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.335
I thought I was helping.

36:10.376 --> 36:13.088
I just changed a few words

36:10.376 --> 36:13.088
here and there, that's it.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.507
We learned a word for

36:13.130 --> 36:15.507
that in class last week.

36:15.548 --> 36:16.925
You changed the whole paper.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.886
Oh, I remember the word.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.886
Plagiarism.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.263
It's not plagiarism.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.263
I didn't use anyone's thoughts.

36:22.305 --> 36:25.517
I just used a couple words

36:22.305 --> 36:25.517
to help Gia out.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.268
Remember what you

36:25.558 --> 36:27.268
always say, Dad?

36:27.310 --> 36:30.022
If it walks like a duck

36:27.310 --> 36:30.022
and talks like a duck,

36:30.063 --> 36:31.523
it's got to be a duck.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.066
Why couldn't you

36:31.564 --> 36:33.066
just trust that I wrote

36:33.108 --> 36:34.985
a good personal

36:33.108 --> 36:34.985
statement on my own?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.445
I have to text

36:35.861 --> 36:37.445
you wherever I go,

36:37.487 --> 36:38.905
I have the earliest curfew,

36:38.947 --> 36:40.824
and now I can't even

36:38.947 --> 36:40.824
write a personal statement

36:40.866 --> 36:43.035
without you looking

36:40.866 --> 36:43.035
over my shoulder.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.495
Okay, guys, I'm gonna change

36:43.076 --> 36:45.495
and head off to Bible study.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.413
The babysitter should be

36:45.537 --> 36:47.413
here in about 15 minutes.

36:47.455 --> 36:50.042
I'm a senior.

36:47.455 --> 36:50.042
I don't need a babysitter.

36:56.381 --> 37:00.010
I'll read the next verse,

36:56.381 --> 37:00.010
and then we can discuss.

37:01.344 --> 37:05.891
"Come to me, all of you

37:01.344 --> 37:05.891
who are weary and burdened,

37:05.932 --> 37:08.727
and I will give you rest.

37:08.768 --> 37:14.315
For my yoke is easy

37:08.768 --> 37:14.315
and my burden is light."

37:14.357 --> 37:17.527
Haven't we all felt

37:14.357 --> 37:17.527
like this at some point?

37:18.695 --> 37:20.697
Oh, I'm so sorry.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.199
I just had to come by

37:22.240 --> 37:25.243
and tell Jimmy some

37:22.240 --> 37:25.243
great news face-to-face.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.953
We did it.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.164
Seriously, are you sure?

37:29.206 --> 37:30.498
Positive, double checked.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.376
What, are you kidding?

37:30.540 --> 37:33.376
That's great.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.671
- Oh, boy.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.671
- Sounds like somebody's

37:33.418 --> 37:36.671
having a baby.

37:36.713 --> 37:40.466
I didn't know you had

37:36.713 --> 37:40.466
taken a new wife, Jimmy.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.761
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,

37:40.508 --> 37:42.761
we're not like that, no.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.262
You don't say husband

37:42.802 --> 37:44.262
and wife anymore.

37:44.303 --> 37:45.931
- I don't?

37:44.303 --> 37:45.931
- They call each other

37:45.972 --> 37:47.140
life partners now.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.017
- They do?

37:47.182 --> 37:49.017
- No, no, no.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.895
This is Faith,

37:49.059 --> 37:51.895
she's my dance partner.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.479
Dance partner?

37:53.521 --> 37:56.524
What happened to calling

37:53.521 --> 37:56.524
each other husband and wife?

37:56.566 --> 37:59.652
Now we call each

37:56.566 --> 37:59.652
other dance partners?

37:59.694 --> 38:03.865
Oh, in that case,

37:59.694 --> 38:03.865
I'm Fred Astaire,

38:03.907 --> 38:06.367
and this is Ginger Rogers.

38:06.409 --> 38:09.579
And we've danced together

38:06.409 --> 38:09.579
for 53 years.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.124
Faith, how would

38:09.621 --> 38:12.124
you like to join us?

38:12.165 --> 38:14.209
Uh, sure.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.585
Come on, take a seat.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.588
You're carrying a child.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.840
So we're officially top ten.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.425
Oh, could you do a favor?

38:20.882 --> 38:22.425
Hit me one time.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.220
- Yes.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.220
- We did it, we did it.

38:25.262 --> 38:30.516
I samba'd at the reunion,

38:25.262 --> 38:30.516
what, what, what, what, what.

38:30.558 --> 38:31.810
Oh.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.271
I was just as excited

38:31.851 --> 38:34.271
when I found out

38:34.312 --> 38:37.023
I was pregnant

38:34.312 --> 38:37.023
for the first time.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.943
Just don't overdo it.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.904
- All right.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.904
- Come on, Harry.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.908
So the next steps

38:44.281 --> 38:46.908
of the competition,

38:46.950 --> 38:49.494
we dance a little

38:46.950 --> 38:49.494
in front of the judges

38:49.535 --> 38:51.746
to get preliminary scores.

38:51.788 --> 38:53.665
Then the finals are live.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.875
Jimmy, you have to

38:53.706 --> 38:55.875
know five dances, okay?

38:55.917 --> 38:57.252
All right.

38:57.294 --> 39:02.590
Waltz, tango, hip-hop,

38:57.294 --> 39:02.590
quickstep and the samba.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.509
At the finals, they're

39:02.632 --> 39:04.509
gonna draw one out of a hat,

39:04.550 --> 39:06.511
and that's the one that we do.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.973
They love us, they love us,

39:07.720 --> 39:09.973
they love us.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.058
You wanna go get

39:10.015 --> 39:12.058
a beer at Bronco Billy's?

39:12.100 --> 39:13.977
- Why not.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.977
- Hit me one more time.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.694
This is Bronco Billy's.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.407
Ah, look what

39:27.073 --> 39:28.407
the cat dragged in.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.617
Oh, Mary Sue.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.036
Hey, this is Faith.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.455
Well, aren't you

39:31.077 --> 39:34.455
a pretty little thing.

39:34.497 --> 39:35.915
Well, go on over,

39:34.497 --> 39:35.915
kick your heels up.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.459
- I'll be right there.

39:35.957 --> 39:38.459
- All right.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.965
Hey, I think I figured it out.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.424
Figured what out?

39:45.466 --> 39:47.468
IC XC.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.055
It means Jesus Christ, right?

39:50.096 --> 39:51.723
Whoa, you figured it out.

39:51.764 --> 39:55.018
- Thank you.

39:51.764 --> 39:55.018
- So does that NIKA stand for?

39:55.060 --> 39:57.312
Come on, just

39:55.060 --> 39:57.312
give me one clue.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.855
All right, here's your clue.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.108
It was 300 A.D., and there

39:58.897 --> 40:02.108
was these two emperors,

40:02.150 --> 40:04.402
Maxentius and Constantine.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.946
They basically were fighting

40:04.443 --> 40:06.946
for control of the western

40:06.988 --> 40:10.491
world, and they met at this

40:06.988 --> 40:10.491
place called the Milvian Bridge.

40:10.533 --> 40:14.162
Whoever won that would

40:10.533 --> 40:14.162
control the western world.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.496
And when they got together,

40:15.538 --> 40:17.540
they used to have

40:15.538 --> 40:17.540
these fortune tellers.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.666
And these fortune tellers would

40:18.708 --> 40:22.045
say who was gonna

40:18.708 --> 40:22.045
win the battle.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.006
And on that day, they told

40:22.087 --> 40:25.006
Constantine he was gonna lose

40:25.048 --> 40:28.551
the battle,

40:25.048 --> 40:28.551
and he was depressed.

40:25.048 --> 40:28.551
And he started walking

40:28.593 --> 40:32.555
back towards his soldiers,

40:28.593 --> 40:32.555
and he looked up in the sky.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.891
And he saw these words:

40:36.976 --> 40:40.813
IX XC NI KA.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.649
And he told his soldiers,

40:40.855 --> 40:43.649
"Take those initials,

40:43.691 --> 40:46.611
put it on your shield.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.611
That's a message from God."

40:46.652 --> 40:49.989
And they did,

40:46.652 --> 40:49.989
and they won the battle.

40:50.031 --> 40:54.160
And Constantine was so grateful

40:50.031 --> 40:54.160
that, from that point on,

40:54.202 --> 40:55.370
he made a decree that no one

40:55.412 --> 40:57.663
could ever kill

40:55.412 --> 40:57.663
a Christian again.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.999
- Wow.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.999
- And that changed the world.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.002
So, that's your clue.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.670
What do you think the

41:03.044 --> 41:04.670
message from God was?

41:04.712 --> 41:06.298
What do you think NI KA means?

41:06.339 --> 41:08.383
Honestly, that's

41:06.339 --> 41:08.383
a tough one. I still--

41:08.425 --> 41:09.634
I can't help you

41:08.425 --> 41:09.634
any more than that.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.010
I'm gonna go get us some drinks.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.179
Okay.

41:15.390 --> 41:19.352
Well, darlin', you must

41:15.390 --> 41:19.352
be one special woman.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.686
Why is that?

41:20.728 --> 41:23.398
He's never brought

41:20.728 --> 41:23.398
anyone here before.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.275
- Really?

41:23.440 --> 41:25.275
- Yep.

41:25.317 --> 41:26.901
He's been coming here

41:25.317 --> 41:26.901
every Friday night

41:26.943 --> 41:28.694
for, oh, a couple years.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.822
This is his table.

41:32.324 --> 41:35.660
That poor man's cried

41:32.324 --> 41:35.660
a lot of tears at this table.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.287
It's good to see him smile.

41:37.329 --> 41:40.332
- Hey, I got you one too.

41:37.329 --> 41:40.332
- Well, you know that's my job.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.792
Come on, a little

41:40.373 --> 41:42.792
sittin' never hurt anybody.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.544
I want you to know that

41:42.834 --> 41:45.544
you are in the presence

41:45.586 --> 41:47.546

41:45.586 --> 41:47.546

41:47.588 --> 41:49.674

about the one next to

45:29.561 --> 45:31.563
the elevator, are you?

45:31.604 --> 45:32.897
Yeah, Sean, that's

45:31.604 --> 45:32.897

45:32.938 --> 45:34.524
You think I got

45:34.566 --> 45:36.651

45:34.566 --> 45:36.651
- Oh, that's mine, mine.

45:36.693 --> 45:37.694
- Anyone got one?

45:37.734 --> 45:39.028
- I got this.

45:40.488 --> 45:41.864

45:41.906 --> 45:43.533
- It's a dance competition.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.533
- No!

45:43.575 --> 45:47.036
- You're killing the competition.

45:43.575 --> 45:47.036
- No, no, it's not--

45:47.078 --> 45:48.287
Sean, Sean, hit me,

45:47.078 --> 45:48.287
hit me, hit me, go, go.

45:48.329 --> 45:49.581
So you're ready,

45:48.329 --> 45:49.581
are you ready?

45:49.622 --> 45:50.747
- Yeah, I'm ready.

45:49.622 --> 45:50.747
- Sit down, sit down.

45:50.789 --> 45:52.375
- No, you're up.

45:50.789 --> 45:52.375
- Yeah, yeah.

45:52.417 --> 45:53.792
- I can't sit, I got no chair.

45:52.417 --> 45:53.792
- No, no, it's cool.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.503
You ready, check this out.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.503
Fire and Ice.

45:55.545 --> 45:57.255
That sucks, go.

45:55.545 --> 45:57.255
Hit me one time.

45:57.296 --> 45:59.048
Hit me one time, Jake, hit me.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.757
Uh, Apocalhips.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.386
- What?

46:03.428 --> 46:05.054
'Cause it's like you're

46:03.428 --> 46:05.054
gonna bring down hellfire.

46:05.096 --> 46:06.389
Yeah, that went

46:05.096 --> 46:06.389
right over my head.

46:06.431 --> 46:07.806
Go.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.309
Hocus Pocus, 'cause

46:07.848 --> 46:10.309
together they're magic.

46:10.351 --> 46:12.520
- Really, come on, no.

46:10.351 --> 46:12.520
- What? Go.

46:12.562 --> 46:15.565
- How about Law and Order.

46:12.562 --> 46:15.565
- Clank, clank.

46:15.607 --> 46:17.983
- Objection.

46:15.607 --> 46:17.983
- 'Cause they're the

46:15.607 --> 46:17.983
justices of the dance.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.318
- Woo!

46:18.025 --> 46:19.318
- No, it's not a--

46:19.360 --> 46:20.945
- All right, guys, go.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.488
- Let's go, come on.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.488
- I got it!

46:22.530 --> 46:23.864
Are you kidding me?

46:27.326 --> 46:30.246
Hey, what are you doing?

46:30.288 --> 46:31.414
Forty-day notice.

46:31.456 --> 46:32.998
This building's being condemned.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.377
Wait, but please, just listen.

46:36.419 --> 46:38.003
No one is gonna come

46:36.419 --> 46:38.003
to this dance studio

46:38.045 --> 46:40.214
if you keep putting

46:38.045 --> 46:40.214
up those notices.

46:40.256 --> 46:42.133
I teach little kids here.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.093
Please.

46:44.135 --> 46:47.263
I got over 70 buildings

46:44.135 --> 46:47.263
I gotta put notices on.

46:51.726 --> 46:53.519
All right, I moved you

46:51.726 --> 46:53.519
to the back on the list.

46:53.561 --> 46:54.811
That'll give you another month.

46:54.853 --> 46:55.772
Okay.

46:55.812 --> 46:57.064
It's the best I can do.

46:57.106 --> 46:59.816
Thank you so much, thank you.

46:59.858 --> 47:01.235
Yeah, yeah, no,

46:59.858 --> 47:01.235
it would be great.

47:01.277 --> 47:02.903
- It would be great.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.781
I would love to do it.

47:04.821 --> 47:06.198
Uh-huh, tell Fred I say hi.

47:06.240 --> 47:09.368
All right, all right, buh-bye.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.080
Hey, who is Jimmy Hope?

47:13.122 --> 47:15.916
Oh, that's my business name.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.418
I'm on the phone

47:15.958 --> 47:17.418
all day long, and people

47:17.460 --> 47:20.212
can never pronounce

47:17.460 --> 47:20.212
or write down Elpidas.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.047
So I just go by Hope.

47:22.089 --> 47:23.633
Well, how'd you

47:22.089 --> 47:23.633
end up with Hope?

47:23.675 --> 47:25.677
That's what Elpidas

47:23.675 --> 47:25.677
means in Greek, hope.

47:25.718 --> 47:27.804
- Oh.

47:25.718 --> 47:27.804
- So I'm Jimmy Hope.

47:27.844 --> 47:29.347
Nice, okay.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.641
Sorry I couldn't make it

47:29.388 --> 47:31.641
down to the studio today.

47:31.683 --> 47:35.186
- Bad day?

47:31.683 --> 47:35.186
- Yeah, my presentation tanked.

47:35.227 --> 47:37.689
- What, the dating website?

47:35.227 --> 47:37.689
- Yeah.

47:37.730 --> 47:41.150
- I told you how

47:37.730 --> 47:41.150
you should do it.

47:37.730 --> 47:41.150
- Remind me.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.653
Instead of checking all

47:41.192 --> 47:43.653
those boxes, you should have

47:43.695 --> 47:46.405
videos of the person

47:43.695 --> 47:46.405
talking about themselves.

47:46.447 --> 47:48.240
- Hm.

47:46.447 --> 47:48.240
- So watch, I'll write down

47:48.282 --> 47:51.160
some questions that you would

47:48.282 --> 47:51.160
just normally check boxes for.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.578
All right.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.541
Go ahead.

47:57.375 --> 48:00.628
All right, Faith Turley.

48:01.878 --> 48:03.506
Do you believe in God?

48:03.548 --> 48:06.342
Well, I wasn't raised

48:03.548 --> 48:06.342
in a religious family.

48:06.384 --> 48:09.886
I never went to

48:06.384 --> 48:09.886
church or got baptized

48:09.928 --> 48:11.723
or anything like that.

48:11.764 --> 48:14.517
My dad split right

48:11.764 --> 48:14.517
before I was born,

48:14.559 --> 48:18.937
so I remember asking my mom,

48:14.559 --> 48:18.937
"Why did you name me Faith if,

48:18.979 --> 48:22.316
you know, we weren't

48:18.979 --> 48:22.316
a religious family?"

48:22.358 --> 48:26.779
And she told me that, when she

48:22.358 --> 48:26.779
was in hospital delivering me,

48:26.821 --> 48:30.366
she was really alone and scared,

48:26.821 --> 48:30.366
but the first time she held

48:30.408 --> 48:34.203
me in her arms, she said she

48:30.408 --> 48:34.203
knew there had to be God,

48:34.245 --> 48:37.914
and I gave her a little faith.

48:37.956 --> 48:40.042
She passed away, though,

48:37.956 --> 48:40.042
a couple years ago.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.795
Ugh, but all these years

48:40.084 --> 48:42.795
I haven't been religious,

48:42.837 --> 48:44.171
I've never gone to church again,

48:44.213 --> 48:48.008
so I just really think

48:44.213 --> 48:48.008
it's too late for me.

48:49.051 --> 48:51.763
No, no, I don't

48:49.051 --> 48:51.763
think that's true.

48:51.804 --> 48:54.557
Well, I hope my mom is up

48:51.804 --> 48:54.557
there putting in a good word for

48:54.599 --> 48:58.018
me 'cause down here I'm still

48:54.599 --> 48:58.018
trying to figure it all out.

48:59.103 --> 49:02.273
Okay, one last question

48:59.103 --> 49:02.273
we have to rehearse.

49:02.314 --> 49:03.982
All right.

49:04.024 --> 49:08.654
Um, what do you think is

49:04.024 --> 49:08.654
the happiest day of your life

49:08.696 --> 49:10.823
and what was the saddest

49:08.696 --> 49:10.823
day of your life?

49:10.865 --> 49:14.159
Uh, the saddest day of my life.

49:10.865 --> 49:14.159
That would have to have

49:14.201 --> 49:18.623
been when I found out

49:14.201 --> 49:18.623
my ex was having an affair.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.125
Well, actually he

49:18.664 --> 49:21.125
had a couple of them.

49:21.166 --> 49:24.295
You know, I left Australia

49:21.166 --> 49:24.295
when I was 16 to study dance

49:24.336 --> 49:28.173
in the States,

49:24.336 --> 49:28.173
and I fell in love.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.635
I fell in love

49:28.215 --> 49:30.635
with my dance teacher.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.219
We were really young.

49:32.261 --> 49:34.806
We were 19 when we got married.

49:34.847 --> 49:38.601
When I found out he was

49:34.847 --> 49:38.601
having all the affairs,

49:39.769 --> 49:41.896
I was absolutely crushed.

49:43.397 --> 49:45.608
I still am, you know?

49:45.650 --> 49:47.109
I just don't know

49:45.650 --> 49:47.109
how one human being

49:47.151 --> 49:50.362
can do that to

49:47.151 --> 49:50.362
another human being.

49:50.404 --> 49:54.784
Anyway, when the divorce

49:50.404 --> 49:54.784
was final, I sat him down,

49:54.826 --> 49:58.412
and I asked him,

49:54.826 --> 49:58.412
"Why did you have the affairs?"

49:58.454 --> 50:02.583
And he said to me that it

49:58.454 --> 50:02.583
was because he wants kids.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.752
I can't have kids.

50:07.212 --> 50:10.215
When I was in high school,

50:07.212 --> 50:10.215
I had an eating disorder,

50:10.257 --> 50:14.136
and I really think that

50:10.257 --> 50:14.136
that messed my body up.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.305
The doctors all told me

50:14.178 --> 50:16.305
that that was the reason

50:16.347 --> 50:18.641
why I couldn't

50:16.347 --> 50:18.641
have children, so...

50:19.684 --> 50:21.644
So instead of just

50:19.684 --> 50:21.644
asking for a divorce,

50:21.686 --> 50:25.397
he went out and had all

50:21.686 --> 50:25.397
these affairs with everybody

50:25.439 --> 50:30.235
and expected for me to get

50:25.439 --> 50:30.235
mad at him and divorce him.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.237
And that's exactly what I did.

50:34.573 --> 50:39.161
All right, um, what was

50:34.573 --> 50:39.161
the happiest day of your life.

50:41.455 --> 50:42.456
When I got rid of him.

50:44.500 --> 50:48.044
You know, I've been thinking

50:44.500 --> 50:48.044
about something you

50:44.500 --> 50:48.044
could help me with.

50:48.086 --> 50:50.172
Oh, sure.

50:50.214 --> 50:51.298
I'm on the phone

50:50.214 --> 50:51.298
all day talking

50:51.340 --> 50:53.217
to clients and everything.

50:53.258 --> 50:55.553
And I've been thinking,

50:53.258 --> 50:55.553
what if started talking

50:55.594 --> 50:57.471
with an Australian accent?

50:58.096 --> 50:59.390
- Really?

50:58.096 --> 50:59.390
- Yeah.

50:59.431 --> 51:00.766
Don't you think that

50:59.431 --> 51:00.766
would make me sound

51:00.808 --> 51:03.936
like more sophisticated

51:00.808 --> 51:03.936
and charming?

51:03.978 --> 51:05.604
- Okay.

51:03.978 --> 51:05.604
- We can start with

51:05.646 --> 51:08.691
something small like,

51:05.646 --> 51:08.691
how would you say goodbye

51:08.733 --> 51:10.359
to a friend in Australia?

51:11.276 --> 51:12.695
Cheers, mate.

51:12.737 --> 51:14.655
Cheers, mate.

51:14.697 --> 51:16.198
Whoa, that was pretty good.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.616
That's good, isn't that?

51:17.658 --> 51:18.617
Don't you think that's great?

51:18.659 --> 51:20.118
That was very good.

51:20.160 --> 51:23.330
Ah, mate, what kinda

51:20.160 --> 51:23.330
dance are we doing tonight?

51:23.372 --> 51:24.707
I think we should

51:23.372 --> 51:24.707
do the hip-hop.

51:24.749 --> 51:26.959
Oh, hit me one time.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.753
- Are you ready for it?

51:27.001 --> 51:28.753
- I'm so ready for that.

51:28.794 --> 51:30.796
You know why? 'Cause I'm about

51:28.794 --> 51:30.796
to bring the hip to the hop.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.007
- Come on.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.007
- To the hip to the hop.

51:33.049 --> 51:35.509
'Cause we got this

51:33.049 --> 51:35.509
place to ourselves.

52:57.466 --> 52:59.343
I'm not here to judge you.

52:59.384 --> 53:02.346
Look, my wife and I, we did

52:59.384 --> 53:02.346
the whole dress up thing.

53:02.387 --> 53:04.180
Really goosed our love lives.

53:04.222 --> 53:08.435
Truth be told, I'm happy to see

53:04.222 --> 53:08.435
you back in the saddle again.

53:08.477 --> 53:10.104
You know what I mean?

53:10.146 --> 53:15.317
Don't worry,

53:10.146 --> 53:15.317
this stays between us. Hmm?

53:17.653 --> 53:20.990
- Oh, boy.

53:21.032 --> 53:23.659
Look who's starting to show.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.370
Yup.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.039
Yeah.

53:28.080 --> 53:32.417
You got a nice round

53:28.080 --> 53:32.417
baby bump going there.

53:32.459 --> 53:33.711
Okay, everybody.

53:33.752 --> 53:36.839
Grab your Bibles,

53:33.752 --> 53:36.839
and let's get started.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.013
- God!

53:42.594 --> 53:44.013
- It's me!

53:44.055 --> 53:46.306
No kidding, I would've

53:44.055 --> 53:46.306
never known that.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.392
Tommy, can you see me?

53:48.433 --> 53:49.685
I can see you.

53:49.727 --> 53:51.896
If you just a little

53:49.727 --> 53:51.896
of that, I'm good.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.440
I got your good,

53:53.981 --> 53:55.440
ready for this?

53:55.482 --> 53:56.358
Go ahead.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.443
Ebony and Ivory.

53:58.485 --> 54:00.779
No, no, they're both white,

53:58.485 --> 54:00.779
that's not gonna work.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.865
You didn't tell me that.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.865
Just rid of the guy.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.865
I mean, he's expendable.

54:02.907 --> 54:06.242
I say-- No, no,

54:02.907 --> 54:06.242
I say we go big with this.

54:02.907 --> 54:06.242
Make it a social statement.

54:06.284 --> 54:08.328
Big Tommy, we can't

54:06.284 --> 54:08.328
get rid of the guy.

54:08.370 --> 54:11.874
- What?

54:08.370 --> 54:11.874
- I got it, Ebony and Ivory.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.542
He hates it.

54:13.584 --> 54:14.710
- Did he steal my?

54:13.584 --> 54:14.710
- Yeah, he.

54:14.752 --> 54:16.336
Did you just

54:14.752 --> 54:16.336
steal my line, bro?

54:16.378 --> 54:17.755
- I got it.

54:16.378 --> 54:17.755
- Ebony and Ivory.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.173
Not gonna work, thanks.

54:19.215 --> 54:22.218
Whatever, which one

54:19.215 --> 54:22.218
of y'all stole my line?

54:22.258 --> 54:23.886
- No, get out.

54:22.258 --> 54:23.886
- It's not Ebony and Ivory.

54:23.928 --> 54:26.222
- What is it? Go ahead.

54:23.928 --> 54:26.222
- It's Peanut Butter and Jelly.

54:26.262 --> 54:28.557
- The tasty dance team.

54:26.262 --> 54:28.557
- Oh, my God, I love that one.

54:28.599 --> 54:29.975
- Yeah, right!

54:28.599 --> 54:29.975
- That's so good,

54:28.599 --> 54:29.975
get outta here.

54:30.017 --> 54:32.061
Yes, come on, I love it.

54:32.103 --> 54:33.395
Yeah, yeah, okay.

54:33.437 --> 54:36.023
Are you sure you guys

54:33.437 --> 54:36.023
work in advertising?

54:36.690 --> 54:38.025
Unbelievable.

54:42.404 --> 54:44.156
Hello.

54:44.198 --> 54:45.991
Hi.

54:49.203 --> 54:50.829
Aren't we practicing?

54:50.871 --> 54:53.916
Just be honest with me,

54:50.871 --> 54:53.916
how do I look in this suit?

54:53.958 --> 54:55.584
Honestly.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.711
Fine.

54:57.753 --> 54:59.838
What... what am I missing here?

54:59.880 --> 55:01.966
The second date

54:59.880 --> 55:01.966
curse happened again.

55:03.634 --> 55:06.428
I went on a date two weeks

55:03.634 --> 55:06.428
ago with a guy named Vinny,

55:06.470 --> 55:07.972
and I never heard from him.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.182
Two weeks?

55:10.224 --> 55:13.102
Well, how did the date go?

55:13.144 --> 55:15.479
It was okay, I guess.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.814
Just okay?

55:16.855 --> 55:18.607
What happened when

55:16.855 --> 55:18.607
you got to the door

55:18.649 --> 55:20.151
with Vinny what's-his-name?

55:20.192 --> 55:22.027
Vinny D'Augustino.

55:22.069 --> 55:25.072
I mean, nothing, he

55:22.069 --> 55:25.072
just dropped me off.

55:25.864 --> 55:27.532
Ooh, ouch, that hurt.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.701
He just dropped you off?

55:29.743 --> 55:31.203
No door action?

55:31.245 --> 55:34.206
No, I'm telling you,

55:31.245 --> 55:34.206
it's because I'm too shy.

55:34.248 --> 55:36.917
Listen, you've got to get

55:34.248 --> 55:36.917
rid of this "too shy" thing.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.543
It's killing all your dates.

55:38.585 --> 55:39.753
Ah, you're right.

55:39.795 --> 55:42.173
Let's say Vinny from the Mafia

55:42.214 --> 55:44.424
had walked you up to

55:42.214 --> 55:44.424
the door, all right?

55:44.466 --> 55:48.846
Show me, like, what would

55:44.466 --> 55:48.846
have been your go-to move?

55:48.887 --> 55:50.055
My what?

55:50.097 --> 55:53.892
You know, your...

55:53.934 --> 55:56.436
Your go-to move.

55:56.478 --> 55:58.230
Why are you giving

55:56.478 --> 55:58.230
me dirty looks for?

55:58.272 --> 55:59.481
Don't you have any moves?

55:59.523 --> 56:01.192
Moves, me?

56:01.233 --> 56:03.819
I'm a dancer, I got more moves

56:01.233 --> 56:03.819
than I know what to do with.

56:03.861 --> 56:06.571
Hello, bang,

56:03.861 --> 56:06.571
that's what you-- See!

56:06.613 --> 56:09.658
You've gotta have a little of

56:06.613 --> 56:09.658
that swag on your dates, okay?

56:09.700 --> 56:11.743
- Okay.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.743
- All right, here's what we do.

56:11.785 --> 56:14.246
Pretend I'm Vinny the hit man,

56:11.785 --> 56:14.246
and I walk you up to the door.

56:14.288 --> 56:19.543
I'm like, "Hey, whoa, hey,

56:14.288 --> 56:19.543
Faith, what a night that was.

56:19.584 --> 56:21.670
When you ordered

56:19.584 --> 56:21.670
that chocolate souffle,

56:21.712 --> 56:24.756
- man, that was unbelievable."

56:21.712 --> 56:24.756
- It's "souffle," actually.

56:24.798 --> 56:27.551
"Faith, when you

56:24.798 --> 56:27.551
start speaking French

56:27.592 --> 56:28.927
like that, forget about it.

56:28.969 --> 56:31.471
You're like the coolest

56:28.969 --> 56:31.471
chick I ever met.

56:31.513 --> 56:34.516
You wanna go upstairs and see

56:31.513 --> 56:34.516
what's left in the doggie bag?"

56:34.558 --> 56:36.685
- Oh, my God.

56:34.558 --> 56:36.685
- "You know what I'm sayin'?"

56:37.769 --> 56:39.104
And you would say?

56:40.147 --> 56:41.232
Vincent.

56:41.273 --> 56:42.816
Oh, I love it,

56:41.273 --> 56:42.816
that's brilliant.

56:42.858 --> 56:44.568
- Do you?

56:42.858 --> 56:44.568
- Call him by his full name.

56:44.609 --> 56:45.986
His mom's probably

56:44.609 --> 56:45.986
the only one that does.

56:46.028 --> 56:47.487
You're tugging on

56:46.028 --> 56:47.487
the whole mom issues.

56:47.529 --> 56:48.822
That's great.

56:47.529 --> 56:48.822
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56:48.864 --> 56:50.282
Go ahead, go ahead,

56:48.864 --> 56:50.282
let me hear it.

56:50.324 --> 56:54.953
Vincent, what

56:50.324 --> 56:54.953
a beautiful night this was.

56:54.995 --> 56:57.331
- Yeah.

56:54.995 --> 56:57.331
- And you know what?

56:58.040 --> 56:59.457
You're a special man.

56:59.499 --> 57:00.709
Go.

57:00.751 --> 57:02.086
And by the time I get home,

57:02.127 --> 57:04.713
I hope to my first

57:02.127 --> 57:04.713
message from you.

57:06.757 --> 57:10.677
And by the way, I love FaceTime.

57:10.719 --> 57:12.221
Ba bam, there you go!

57:12.263 --> 57:14.014
- Was that good?

57:12.263 --> 57:14.014
- That's great.

57:14.056 --> 57:15.431
Guys love that stuff.

57:15.473 --> 57:17.517
- I'm really trying.

57:15.473 --> 57:17.517
- You've got it in you.

57:17.559 --> 57:19.519
- You just gotta let it out.

57:17.559 --> 57:19.519
- Gosh.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.272
All right, here's

57:19.561 --> 57:21.272
what you need to do.

57:21.313 --> 57:23.648
You're gonna hit Vinny

57:21.313 --> 57:23.648
with a revenge post.

57:23.690 --> 57:25.525
A revenge post, what is that?

57:25.567 --> 57:28.028
Go in the back, put on one

57:25.567 --> 57:28.028
of those red tango dresses.

57:28.070 --> 57:29.613
Come on back out,

57:28.070 --> 57:29.613
I'll explain it to you.

57:29.654 --> 57:34.076
- All right, okay.

57:29.654 --> 57:34.076
- "I love FaceTime." What?

57:43.001 --> 57:45.462
Okay, how does this look?

57:45.503 --> 57:48.048
Yeah, that's what

57:45.503 --> 57:48.048
I'm talkin' about.

57:48.090 --> 57:50.508
Next time you go out with

57:48.090 --> 57:50.508
Vinny, you wear that red dress.

57:50.550 --> 57:54.096
Give him a little

57:50.550 --> 57:54.096
bang, pow, what?

57:54.138 --> 57:56.140
Oh, this little old red thing?

57:56.181 --> 57:58.767
Yeah, let me see you

57:56.181 --> 57:58.767
work it out a little bit.

57:56.181 --> 57:58.767
There you go.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.769
And when you go to the

57:58.809 --> 58:00.769
restaurant you park your car,

58:00.811 --> 58:04.106
you toss the keys to the valet.

58:00.811 --> 58:04.106
What you gonna say to the valet?

58:04.148 --> 58:08.986
Mr. Valet, I ain't mad at ya.

58:04.148 --> 58:08.986
That's just how I walk.

58:09.027 --> 58:10.487
That's how you walk

58:09.027 --> 58:10.487
and when you go inside

58:10.528 --> 58:11.863
the restaurant and

58:10.528 --> 58:11.863
you see the waiter,

58:11.905 --> 58:13.531
what are you gonna

58:11.905 --> 58:13.531
say to the waiter?

58:13.573 --> 58:17.577
Mr. Waiter, can I get some

58:13.573 --> 58:17.577
fries to go with my shake?

58:17.619 --> 58:20.372
Yeah! And when you see Vinny the

58:17.619 --> 58:20.372
hit man D'Augustino and he looks

58:21.748 --> 58:24.918
at you and you look at him,

58:21.748 --> 58:24.918
you know what you gotta do?

58:24.960 --> 58:26.253
Hit 'em one time, Faith.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.505
- Bang.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.505
- Hit 'em two times, Faith.

58:28.546 --> 58:29.547
Bang, pow!

58:29.589 --> 58:30.966
Oh, don't hurt 'em now, Faith.

58:31.008 --> 58:32.759
Oh, I'm about to hurt him.

58:32.801 --> 58:34.094
Don't hurt 'em.

58:34.136 --> 58:35.512
Hit 'em three times, Faith.

58:35.553 --> 58:37.222
Bang, pow, what?

58:37.264 --> 58:41.559
Goodbye, shyness.

58:37.264 --> 58:41.559
Hello, Miss Faith Turley.

58:41.601 --> 58:42.811
There you go.

58:42.853 --> 58:45.105
Now you're ready

58:42.853 --> 58:45.105
for a revenge post.

58:45.147 --> 58:47.399
Hold on, what is

58:45.147 --> 58:47.399
this revenge post?

58:47.441 --> 58:49.693
You and Vinny are friends

58:47.441 --> 58:49.693
on the internet, right?

58:49.734 --> 58:51.445
You get a guy friend of yours.

58:51.487 --> 58:54.990
The two of you go out on

58:51.487 --> 58:54.990
a fake date on the town, okay?

58:55.032 --> 58:57.409
You take a bunch of fake

58:55.032 --> 58:57.409
selfies of the two of you having

58:57.451 --> 59:01.246
dinner, canoodling, dancing

58:57.451 --> 59:01.246
up a storm, feeding him food,

59:01.288 --> 59:03.374
sitting on his lap, you

59:01.288 --> 59:03.374
wrap it all up at the end

59:03.415 --> 59:06.835
of the night with a short

59:03.415 --> 59:06.835
little kiss at the door.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.379
I'm telling you,

59:06.877 --> 59:08.379
Vinny will be calling

59:08.420 --> 59:10.506
you the next day for a date.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.341
I like it.

59:12.383 --> 59:14.801
I just don't have

59:12.383 --> 59:14.801
anybody to do it with me.

59:14.843 --> 59:16.178
And it needs to be done tonight

59:16.220 --> 59:19.223
because I wanna be asked

59:16.220 --> 59:19.223
out on Valentine's Day.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.850
I can do it. I can fake canoodle

59:19.264 --> 59:21.850
with the best of 'em.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.227
Amazing.

59:23.268 --> 59:24.728
You said you can do

59:23.268 --> 59:24.728
any kinda dance, right?

59:24.769 --> 59:26.522
Yeah, of course, yeah.

59:31.693 --> 59:33.278
When you dance Greek,

59:33.320 --> 59:37.491
you have to say "yasou"

59:33.320 --> 59:37.491
and then person's first name.

59:37.533 --> 59:39.910
Like, "Yasou Faith."

59:40.827 --> 59:42.996
Yasou Jimmy.

59:43.038 --> 59:44.873
But you gotta say

59:43.038 --> 59:44.873
it like a Greek.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.418
Yasou Jimmy.

59:47.918 --> 59:49.545
Yasou Jimmy.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.422
There you go, you

59:49.586 --> 59:51.422
sound like a Greek now.

59:51.463 --> 59:54.716
Yasou Jimmy.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.853
Isn't that same wine

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.853
we've been serving all night?

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.564
Yeah.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.705
- Yasou Jimmy.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.500
Aw, man.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:13.753
Well, thank you.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.756
I'm gonna post

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.756
the pictures tonight.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.426
I'm telling you,

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:19.426
he's gonna be one jealous guy.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.096
Yeah.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:28.310
So, uh, I guess I'll see

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:28.310
you at practice tomorrow.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.525
What about the kiss?

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:37.902
Oh, that's right.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.821
The kiss.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.495
Are you ready?

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.807
I don't think I got that one.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.686
Probably should do it again.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.479
Yeah, you try.

01:02:29.705 --> 01:02:31.498
I think we got it.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.500
I think we did too.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.507
Yasou Jimmy.

01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:43.385
Cheers, mate.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.138
Good night.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.515
Good night.

01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:09.869
- Demetra, look.

01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:09.869
- What?

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:13.331
Dad and Miss Turley

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:13.331
went on a date.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.459
And they made out.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.918
- I can't believe it.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.378
Oh, my gosh.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.378
This is so crazy.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.004
Like, this is insane.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.004
Like, so weird.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.466
- I can't even understand why.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.466
- This is insane.

01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:25.802
So how was your night?

01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:27.845
A little late,

01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:27.845
don't you think?

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:34.978
Oh, you guys.

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:36.438
Welcome to

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:36.438
the preliminary trials

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.316
of the Pro-Schmo

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.316
Dance Competition.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.549
Okay, so this is

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.549
how today's gonna go.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.426
We're gonna get to see

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.426
who the judges are,

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.219
do a little dancing,

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.219
get preliminary scores,

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.055
which only count for one-third

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.055
of the total score, okay?

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:13.350
The other two-thirds

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:13.350
are from the finale.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:18.104
By the way, I think

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:18.104
our game plan worked.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.107
I got a text from Vinny, asking

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.107
me out on Valentine's Day.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.942
- Oh, really?

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.942
- Mm-hm.

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:26.571
Hey, mission accomplished.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:30.492
Oh, is there a stunned

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:30.492
silence over the room suddenly?

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:35.997
Yeah, nobody thought little

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:35.997
Gerry Hogwood II could dance.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.126
Everyone counted

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.126
out the little kid

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:43.672
from Kansas with

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:43.672
a big dream in his heart.

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:45.340
Well, let me tell ya.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:51.054
This is America, where every

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:51.054
dream has the right to live.

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:54.015
So I'll be dancin'

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:54.015
my heart out tonight

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:58.770
for every dancer who ever

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:58.770
dreamed the American dream.

01:04:58.812 --> 01:04:59.855
Dream the dream, son.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.314
I love you, Papa.

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.525
Now if you'll excuse me,

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:06.944
I believe your dressing

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:06.944
room time is done.

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:10.073
Couple number seven,

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:10.073
what's your team name?

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:11.867
Oh, my fault.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.117
We haven't come up with one yet.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.578
Come on, guys, it

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.578
takes five minutes

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.204
to come up with a team name.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.789
I'll just call you out as

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.789
couple number seven for now.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:18.956
- Okay.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.500
First up is the tango.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:22.919
We have to come up

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:22.919
with a team name.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.630
I'm working on it,

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.630
I'm working on it.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.549
What's the matter?

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:30.301
The male judge, it's my ex.

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:32.763
- Seriously?

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:32.763
- Next up, starting out

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:32.763
with the tango

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:34.305
is couple number seven.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.767
Judges, are you

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.767
ready to cue music?

01:05:56.870 --> 01:06:00.373
I'm sorry. I let you down.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.627
It's only a third

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.627
of our total score.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.504
We're in last.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.715
Even Hogwood's in front of us.

01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:11.217
So do you still

01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:11.217
wanna practice tonight?

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:13.887
If you still want

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:13.887
me as your partner.

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:17.140
I'm kinda stuck

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:17.140
with you now, huh?

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:19.810
Listen, let's just get outta

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:19.810
the studio, get some fresh air.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.938
I have a great place

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.938
we can go, okay?

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:23.897
Sounds good.

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:25.482
Okay.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:26.983
Rough day out there.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:29.903
We'll be better.

01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.195
You'll see.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:33.030
He's a great dancer.

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:35.784
It's really hard to tell

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:35.784
with you doing all the leading.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:39.329
Hey, if he's that good,

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:39.329
why don't you just

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.164
trust him to do the right thing?

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:42.457
Maybe I'm just a little short

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.208
on trusting anyone these days.

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:53.009
One, two, three, left, right--

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:53.009
No. You did it wrong.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.345
I got it, I got it, I got it,

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.345
got it, got it, got it.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:58.515
Five, six, seven,

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:58.515
eight and go.

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:01.225
One, two, three, left, right--

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:01.225
No, you did it again.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.895
- It's that-- It's just that--

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.895
- It's left, right, left.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.981
- All right.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.981
- Jimmy, what's

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.981
wrong with you?

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.525
Haven't you ever

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.525
done a tango before?

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.402
Yeah, I mean, I did it

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.402
a couple times with Debbie,

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.321
but other than that, you know...

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.198
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:16.992
- I didn't even think.

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:16.992
- Oh, no, no.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.870
No, no, no, no, that's...

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.870
it's totally fine,

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.454
totally fine, totally fine.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:22.622
Let's go again.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:24.248
No, no, listen,

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:24.248
let's just take

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.583
a break for a minute, okay?

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.002
Come on.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:32.382
Have you ever talked to

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:32.382
anyone about losing her?

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:35.051
Uh, no.

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:38.930
I probably should've,

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:38.930
but no, I never have.

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:41.516
We...

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:45.186
We made out our wills a couple

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:45.186
months before Debbie passed

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:49.900
away, and we put in a letter

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:49.900
to each other in case one

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:55.739
of us died suddenly,

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:55.739
and I've never been able

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.658
to open her letter

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.658
that she wrote me.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.535
Why?

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:04.039
You know...

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.792
Ah...

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:15.842
I loved that woman, you know,

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:15.842
and I loved talking to her.

01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:18.261
And I feel like,

01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:18.261
if I open that letter,

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:24.183
it'll be like the final

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:24.183
conversation that we ever have,

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:26.853
and I'm just not ready for that.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:30.356
She died in a car

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:30.356
accident, right?

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:32.149
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.819
Did you have a chance to

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.819
talk to her before she passed?

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:40.323
Well, she made it to the ICU,

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:40.323
and then the doctor,

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.118
they tried to help her. She

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.118
was in a coma, and they just,

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.203
there was nothing

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.203
they could do for her,

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.163
but her vital signs kept going.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:51.210
She was a tiny little thing

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:51.210
but just so strong.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:55.298
And I cleared everybody out

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:55.298
of the room, and I brought

01:08:55.339 --> 01:09:01.261
in Gia and Demetra. And I had

01:08:55.339 --> 01:09:01.261
them say their final goodbyes,

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:02.973
and then it was just

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:02.973
her and I alone in the room.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:07.518
And I talked about the first

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:07.518
date that we ever went on.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.064
Went to this Latin music

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.064
festival, and then afterwards,

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:15.068
we watched the sunset. And

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:15.068
she said, "Do you wanna get up

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.403
and tango?" And I said,

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.403
you know, "Okay, yeah."

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:22.993
So... but I did, and, uh, I was

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:22.993
horrible. And she said to me,

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.202
"You know, if you ask me out

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.202
on a couple more dates,

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:26.955
I'll teach you how to do this."

01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:28.205
I said, "Sure."

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.249
So every year we

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.249
would go back there

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.627
for our anniversary,

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.627
and we would...

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:40.343
We would dance

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:40.343
and, you know, enjoy the sunset.

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:44.430
When we were there

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:44.430
in the hospital, I... I, um...

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:53.814
I took her hand, and I told her

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:53.814
we were back at that sunset...

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:58.945
dancing, and I told her,

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:58.945
I said, "Hey, you know,

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:04.993
when two people dance,

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:04.993
it's okay if one

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:07.578
of their hands slips away."

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:12.083
Because, you know, dancers

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:12.083
always come back together.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:15.336
Their hands join again

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:15.336
when they finish that dance.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.506
I said to Debbie,

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.506
"It's okay if your

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.299
hand slips away from mine.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:24.846
Just keep staring at

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:24.846
that sunset, and it'll set.

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:30.768
And a moment later,"

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:30.768
I told her, "the sun will rise."

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:37.358
And I'm telling you,

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:37.358
Faith, when the run rises,

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.071
oh, man,

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.071
it's gonna be beautiful.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:42.488
It's gonna be beautiful.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:47.243
I told her, "We're gonna

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:47.243
be back together again,

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:49.495
and we're gonna

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:49.495
finish that dance.

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:52.874
And we'll be together forever."

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.626
Couldn't have been more than

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.626
a minute or so, and I could feel

01:10:55.668 --> 01:11:02.592
her hand slip away and...

01:10:55.668 --> 01:11:02.592
and then she was gone.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.427
How did you ever

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.427
get through that?

01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:07.388
I never prayed

01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:07.388
so hard in my life.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.515
Were you always

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.515
that religious?

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:11.184
I don't know what

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:11.184
you would call it.

01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:12.602
A casual Christian,

01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:12.602
that's what I would call myself.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:15.354
Somebody who went

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:15.354
to church every so often,

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:17.941
prayed every so often,

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:17.941
took his kids

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:19.400
to Sunday school every so often,

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:24.739
but I told God, if He

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:24.739
could get me through that,

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.324
you know, I would never be...

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:34.124
I would never be casual

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:34.124
about being a Christian again.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:36.292
So that's why you

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:36.292
pray all the time.

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:39.045
Mm-hm.

01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:42.966
Anyway, ugh, I know, how

01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:42.966
do we get off all this?

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.634
We got some dancin' to do here.

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.803
Why don't we take one last run

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.803
through and see what we got.

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:51.266
Jimmy, I know

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:51.266
you miss her, okay?

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.187
You are gonna see her again.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.524
You are gonna have

01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.524
that final dance with her.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:05.488
And whenever that day comes,

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:05.488
however far off it is in the

01:12:05.529 --> 01:12:10.285
future, you're gonna be ready

01:12:05.529 --> 01:12:10.285
for the dance, Jimmy Hope.

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:14.580
And if you would do me

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:14.580
the honor, I would love to be

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:17.208
the one who gets you

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:17.208
ready for that dance.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.800
- Thank you.

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:28.178
I missed a lot of those steps.

01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:29.512
I don't know, are you

01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:29.512
sure you can train me?

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:30.805
I promise I can.

My mom always wished

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.557
we had a brother.

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:41.269
Not for my sister and I,

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:41.269
but for my dad.

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.687
Someone he could've thrown

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.687
a baseball with

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.398
or gone to a football game with.

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:48.943
Why is one side

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:48.943
of my face so much easier

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:50.778
to make up than the other side?

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.571
Everyone's face is like that.

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:55.366
One side is always different

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:55.366
from the other.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.952
But when you put them together,

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.952
they work.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:01.205
It's what you call

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:01.205
perfectly imperfect.

01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:03.207
I like that.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:04.834
Perfectly imperfect.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.170
Come on, let's

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.170
go show your dad.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:12.133
Oh, wow.

01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:15.636
Wow, look at you.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.848
That's George.

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:20.891
What's my curfew tonight, Dad?

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.186
Uh, you know, midnight.

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.896
The after-party doesn't

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.896
even start till 11:30.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.649
Uh, 12:30.

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:30.901
45.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.988
12:45, 12:45, that'll... Yeah.

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:37.533
You know,

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:37.533
why don't we say 1:00.

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:40.286
- That would be awesome, Dad.

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:40.286
- Okay, let's hug it out.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:42.579
Have fun, honey.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:43.873
- Be safe.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:43.873
- Bye.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.500
Be safe. Thank you, by the way.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.293
I appreciate you coming over

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.293
and helping with the makeup.

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:49.003
You know, I'm not

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:49.003
good with that stuff.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.838
Very welcome.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:57.678
Did you forget something?

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.638
No, I was just wondering.

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:03.059
Do you think mom

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:03.059
would be proud of me?

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:09.273
Oh... I know she

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:09.273
would be proud of you.

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.068
I just wish I hadn't

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.068
argued with her so much.

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.278
I hope I don't argue

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.278
with you too much.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.280
That's what teenagers do.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:23.120
Go have some fun.

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:27.166
Not too much fun, but fun.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.876
How cute.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.876
That's Gia.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.920
She has her mom's eyes.

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:37.176
Can we watch a movie

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:37.176
with Miss Turley?

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.012
Faith?

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.139
Sure, yeah.

01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:06.289
I think it's time I head out.

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:12.420
What are you doing home?

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:14.630
Some kids were doing some

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:14.630
stupid stuff at the party.

01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:16.673
So we just called it a night.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:18.717
Oh, Faith, I didn't know

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:18.717
you were still here.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:20.511
Oh, I was just leaving.

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:22.930
Can Faith help put

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:22.930
us to bed tonight?

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.808
Um, Faith, I mean, if you want?

01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:27.184
I'd love to.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.187
Okay.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.856
Just the girls.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:34.233
What?

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:38.112
Okay, so, what

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:38.112
do you guys usually do?

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:40.864
We usually talk about

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:40.864
anything that's on our mind,

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:44.577
say a prayer, and Dad

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:44.577
gives us a hug good night.

01:17:44.619 --> 01:17:47.121
Well, what's on your mind?

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.956
Do you like our Dad?

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.000
Oh, of course I do.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:54.003
No, I mean, do you

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:54.003
"like" like him?

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.880
"Like" like? I...

01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:58.591
I hope you do.

01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:01.469
That's what I think

01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:01.469
about all the time.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.012
Your dad and I

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.012
are dance partners,

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.098
but... and we've become

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.098
really great friends.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.892
I think he "like" likes you.

01:18:09.726 --> 01:18:12.229
I pray about it every night.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.731
Well, speaking of praying,

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:17.610
I'm gonna head out to let you

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:17.610
guys say your prayers, okay?

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:19.195
Can you pray with us?

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.573
Of course, yeah.

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:29.539
Dear God, thank you

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:29.539
for a great prom tonight.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:33.334
Please watch over our dad,

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:33.334
our family and Faith.

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:36.837
Thank you for having

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:36.837
Faith come over tonight.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:40.841
Please help Daddy and Faith

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:40.841
win the dance contest.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:45.596
Please watch over Mommy

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:45.596
in heaven. I love you.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:49.808
- Your turn.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:49.808
Oh.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:52.728
Um, thank you

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:52.728
for this beautiful moment

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:56.524
I just shared with these

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:56.524
two incredible young women.

01:18:56.566 --> 01:18:58.401
You've truly touched my heart.

01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:01.487
You really do have

01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:01.487
amazing girls.

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:03.947
Well, thank you.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.993
So, um, no rehearsal tomorrow?

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:10.913
Right, it's Valentine's Day.

01:19:10.954 --> 01:19:12.248
Oh, right, yeah.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:13.999
But, you know,

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:13.999
finals are Tuesday,

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:17.753
so let's try and get one

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:17.753
last practice in before then.

01:19:17.794 --> 01:19:19.505
Yeah, yeah, of course, sure.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.966
Okay, uh, good night.

01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:24.885
Good night.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:38.148
- Hi, long time no see.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:38.148
- Yeah.

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.693
Um, do you have a few minutes?

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:42.069
Yeah, sure, sure.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.904
I would love to talk

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.904
to you about something.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.741
I've been thinking

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.741
about this for a while.

01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:49.159
Go ahead.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:52.079
I'm thinking about

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:52.079
getting baptized.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:53.414
- Really?

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:53.414
- Yeah.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:54.665
You're kidding.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.792
What made you decide that?

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:59.336
Well, that first night

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:59.336
I came to Bible study,

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:01.464
they were reading

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:01.464
a Bible passage about,

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:05.050
if you were tired or weary,

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:05.050
God would give you rest.

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:09.846
I just felt like crying 'cause

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:09.846
that's exactly how I feel.

01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:14.602
I'm just tired and,

01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:14.602
when I heard that verse,

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.604
it just got me

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.604
thinking, you know?

01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.441
What do you think

01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.441
is holding you back?

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:23.402
Throughout my life, men

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:23.402
have always let me down.

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:28.658
Whether it be my dad,

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:28.658
my ex, my boyfriends.

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:31.952
I've had to learn

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:31.952
to really just rely on myself.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:35.872
Maybe that's why I always

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:35.872
lead on the dance floor.

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:38.501
And getting baptized,

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:38.501
it feels like

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.796
I'm being asked to trust

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.796
someone else with my life.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.589
Who also happens to be a man,

01:20:44.799 --> 01:20:46.759
and that never

01:20:44.799 --> 01:20:46.759
worked out for me.

01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:49.970
All those guys you mentioned,

01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:49.970
your ex, your boyfriends,

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:55.476
your dad, they're

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:55.476
imperfect, but him,

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:58.937
that's a different story.

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:01.524
Like I said,

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:01.524
I'm thinking about it.

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:03.942
Good deal.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.945
By the way, I figured

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.945
out another part

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:09.740
of the shirt you're wearing.

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:14.244
In between those letters is

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:14.244
a cross and it means "believe."

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.247
- Oh, that's pretty good.

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.247
- Nice, I told you.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:20.543
Now I just need to figure

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:20.543
out what NI KA stands for.

01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:29.760
- It's me.

01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:29.760
- Oh, rea--?

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.053
Tommy, I can't see you.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.053
Is that you?

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:33.889
- Yeah.

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:33.889
- No kidding.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:35.307
- All right, I got it.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:35.307
- Go ahead.

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:37.727
He's thunder, she's lightning.

01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:40.521
Together, they're

01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:40.521
the Thunderstorms.

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:41.772
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.566
I got it, I got it.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.566
It's like this.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:48.445
She's flirty, he's gangster.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:48.445
Together, they are Hoodwinked.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:50.531
No, they're dancers.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:50.531
They're not gangsters.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:52.241
There's not a thunderstorm.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:52.241
It's--

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:56.161
He's snap, she's crackle.

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:56.161
Together, they pop!

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:58.706
- Oh, it's like cereal.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:58.706
- Hey, guys, hey, guys.

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:01.250
- Joey--

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:01.250
- Did you do your fantasy

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:01.250
football picks this week?

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.669
- No, guys, let's not...

01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:05.962
You guys are pitching

01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:05.962
without me. That's not fair.

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:07.631
We're gonna get it,

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:07.631
we're gonna get it.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.007
- Good stuff, guys, good stuff--

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.007
- The dancing thing.

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:10.300
What is that?

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:12.386
That's your A game?

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.473
Yeah, Jake?

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.142
What is it, Jake, what?

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.394
What? I can't hear you.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.104
I was, uh...

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.104
I actually can't drive,

01:22:22.145 --> 01:22:23.647
so I don't need

01:22:22.145 --> 01:22:23.647
the parking spot.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.233
- Oh, I love you.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.233
- But I wanna help.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.110
Okay, go get rid of

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.110
those four, and we'll talk.

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:29.986
- Okay, great.

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:29.986
I'll keep thinking.

01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:29.986
- Okay, good.

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:32.197
Love you Jake, love you.

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:32.197
Get that license.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.323
- Good, you're good, Jake.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.323
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:34.784
- Watch the door.

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:34.784
- I'm good.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.307
All right. I'm gonna run out

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.307
for a little bit.

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.392
I'll be back in like

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.392
an hour or so, okay?

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:01.560
Okay.

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.479
All right.

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.657
What are you doing?

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:17.618
- Driving home.

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:17.618
- Home?

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.704
Well, don't tell me that

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.704
your date is over already.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:22.122
Yeah.

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:23.791
Well, what happened?

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:26.042
My heart just wasn't in it.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:29.880
Your heart is in love

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:29.880
with someone else.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:31.548
- No way.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:31.548
- What?

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.509
- No way.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.509
- What?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.721
- No way.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.721
- You're killing me, what?

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:39.473
It's Funkenstein.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:40.641
Frankenstein?

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:42.392
It's Jimmy.

01:23:44.979 --> 01:23:46.480
He's at the studio.

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:50.317
Well, I thought I heard

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:50.317
something down there.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.819
What are you doing down there?

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:54.070
Well I'm in Studio B,

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:58.116
having a romantic

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:58.116
dinner with Harold.

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:01.912
Well, what is he doing?

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:03.455
Practicing.

01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:09.336
He's actually practicing.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:17.011
Whoa, busted.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.014
What am I gonna do

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.014
with you, Jimmy Hope?

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.516
Have you been practicing

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.516
here every night?

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:25.101
No, just, you know,

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:25.101
a couple nights.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:27.062
You wanna win that bad, huh?

01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:30.691
Yeah, this place grows on ya.

01:24:32.026 --> 01:24:34.110
What happened to your date?

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:35.946
It ended.

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:39.575
I guess Vinny didn't have

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:39.575
enough "bang, pow, what" for me.

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:44.788
So do you want a partner?

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.791
Mm-hm.

01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:50.627

to kiss here, right?

01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:25.514
Right.

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:31.353
Oh, bad timing on my part.

01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:33.188
Well, I just wanted to say that

01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:35.231
y'all have

01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:35.231
the music up too loud.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:38.152
You know I got

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:38.152
business upstairs.

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:40.821
I'll see you at the finals

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:40.821
on Tuesday, okay?

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:42.739
Yeah, I'll see ya there.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:57.129
All right, first of all,

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:57.129
I wanna thank you, Pete,

01:26:57.171 --> 01:27:01.216
for being here representing

01:26:57.171 --> 01:27:01.216
the Soul 2Soul board

01:27:01.257 --> 01:27:03.052
and I want you to know that

01:27:01.257 --> 01:27:03.052
we're grateful that you're

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:06.596
giving us another chance

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:06.596
to win this account.

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:10.893
All right, Jimmy,

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:10.893
the show is all yours.

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:14.479
We think that Soul 2Soul

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:14.479
can redefine the entire dating

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:17.066
market and we'd be

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:17.066
happy to show you that.

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:21.486
Oh, oh, no, no,

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:21.486
that's the wrong slide.

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.488
- Hold on a second, guys.

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.488
- Yeah, it's guitars.

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.032
That's guitars.

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:26.200
Those are guitars.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.451
- Oh, no, wait.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.328
- Whoops.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.328
- Ah, Jimmy, it's...

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:34.290
- That's broken. Uh, that's...

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:34.290
- Hold on, hold on.

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:35.667
Here, let me help.

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:42.382
What?

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:44.593
My two-week notice.

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:50.640
Anything else?

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.101
Brian, I don't

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.101
have it anymore.

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:53.685
Sure, you do.

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.979
Something's holding you back.

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.979
I wish I was a shrink.

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:57.522
I could help you figure it out.

01:27:57.564 --> 01:28:01.526
But my gut tells me,

01:27:57.564 --> 01:28:01.526
you still got

01:28:01.568 --> 01:28:03.528
a great presentation in you.

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:07.699
Is there any chance you can

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:07.699
get Soul 2Soul to come back?

01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:09.367
I'm working on it.

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:12.579
You just figure out

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:12.579
what's holding you back, huh?

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:14.790
You'll be aces again.

01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:18.877
Or not.

01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:28.595
Mr. Elpidas, I read

01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:28.595
Gia's personal statement,

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:32.015
and I thought it would be

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:32.015
a good idea for you to hear it.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:36.228
In talking to many

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:36.228
college administrators,

01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:38.272
I've been told that

01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:38.272
my GPA is great,

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.898
my test scores are great,

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.399
but it was important

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.399
to me to explain

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:43.735
that one C I got

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:43.735
during high school.

01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:46.196
It was in geometry,

01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:46.196
my freshman year.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:50.951
Three years ago,

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:50.951
during my freshman year,

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:53.245
my mother was killed

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:53.245
in a car accident.

01:28:53.287 --> 01:28:59.626
My life was turned upside down,

01:28:53.287 --> 01:28:59.626
and slowly, over time,

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:02.378
I've been getting it

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:02.378
turned right side up again.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.591
But that's not the real reason

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.591
I got a C in geometry.

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:10.179
The real reason is

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:10.179
I'm no good in geometry.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:14.308
Geometry doesn't like me,

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:14.308
and I don't like geometry.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.435
That's just the way

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.435
life is sometimes.

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:19.229
You see, what I learned

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:19.229
from losing my mother

01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:23.608
is that life is imperfect.

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:26.486
Mother's aren't supposed to die

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:26.486
before they see their girls

01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:31.283
go to prom or go to college

01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:31.283
or get married.

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:38.040
But like I said,

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:38.040
life is imperfect.

01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:40.167
And for those who told me

01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:40.167
I really needed to explain

01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:44.420
why I got that one C

01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:44.420
in high school, I kept thinking,

01:29:44.462 --> 01:29:47.007
you're looking for

01:29:44.462 --> 01:29:47.007
someone who's perfect.

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:49.718
That's just not me.

01:29:51.427 --> 01:29:55.098
I make mistakes sometimes.

01:29:51.427 --> 01:29:55.098
I'm not crazy about the way

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.561
I look sometimes. I talk

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.561
back to my dad sometimes.

01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:02.605
- Sorry, Dad.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:08.820
I'm also hard-working, honest,

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:08.820
loving, and I do really,

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.323
really good in school,

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.323
except in geometry.

01:30:13.367 --> 01:30:18.830
In other words,

01:30:13.367 --> 01:30:18.830
I'm perfectly imperfect.

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:22.959
If that sounds interesting

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:22.959
to you, then we should talk.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:28.173
Sincerely,

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:28.173
perfectly imperfect Gia.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:32.802
That's my daughter.

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:35.305
Perfectly imperfect,

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:35.305
I love that.

01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.724
- I'm glad.

01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.724
- That's great.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:39.517
Are you gonna miss me

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:39.517
when I go to college?

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.229
Oh, of course. I'll miss you

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.229
fighting with your sister,

01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:44.438
you throwing all your

01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:44.438
clothes on the ground,

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.399
you talking back to me--

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.567
- Oh, okay.

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.567
- Oh, my gosh.

01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:49.861
Hey, man, what's up?

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:51.405
Yeah, hey, Jimmy,

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:51.405
I got the Soul 2Soul execs

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.907
to meet us again

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.907
next Tuesday at 6:00.

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.868
Oh, no, Bri, Bri, you gotta move

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.868
the meeting from Tuesday.

01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:58.870
Hey, I can't.

01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:58.870
After what happened,

01:30:58.912 --> 01:31:01.290
we're lucky they're

01:30:58.912 --> 01:31:01.290
giving us another chance.

01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:04.167
Come on, there's no way

01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:04.167
we're changing this.

01:31:05.294 --> 01:31:07.170
All right, okay.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.338
Come on.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.589
But, Jimmy, you've

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.589
known for months

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.133
that the finals

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.133
are this Tuesday.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:12.592
I'm telling you, it's

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:12.592
completely out of my hands.

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:14.136
There's nothing I can do.

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:17.139
- There is nothing you can do?

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:17.139
- No, they'll fire me.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.641
Why did I think this

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.641
would end any differently

01:31:19.682 --> 01:31:21.810
than anything else in my life?

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:42.372
You're kidding me,

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:42.372
I died first?

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:43.748
- Oh, man.

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.499
This stinks.

01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:48.837
Well, come to think of it,

01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:48.837
I'm probably having

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:51.965
a really good time up

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:51.965
in heaven at this point.

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:54.592
Now knowing you,

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:54.592
you've probably been

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:57.012
in absolute agony missing me.

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:59.513
Okay, I'll give you a year.

01:31:59.555 --> 01:32:02.434
But come on, Jimmy,

01:31:59.555 --> 01:32:02.434
what good does that do?

01:32:02.476 --> 01:32:04.060
Are you going to be

01:32:02.476 --> 01:32:04.060
like the grandmas

01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:06.938
and wear a black

01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:06.938
shawl for 40 years?

01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.273
Get on with it.

01:32:08.315 --> 01:32:10.650
Listen, there's

01:32:08.315 --> 01:32:10.650
a reason why we keep

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:13.153
the casket open at funerals.

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:15.322
We don't fear death.

01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:18.532
The king has already

01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:18.532
paid the price.

01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:22.078
The victory has already

01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:22.078
been granted to us.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.621
Remember Easter?

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:25.999
Oh, death, where is thy sting?

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:29.294
Now, I'm figuring,

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:29.294
at some point,

01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:31.838
and it better not be too soon,

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.299
God will put another

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.299
woman in your life.

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:37.469
Yes, God will put her

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:37.469
in your life, Jimmy.

01:32:37.511 --> 01:32:40.180
And you'll be

01:32:37.511 --> 01:32:40.180
wondering what to do.

01:32:40.847 --> 01:32:42.057
So here's the checklist.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:45.852
One, does she love

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:45.852
our daughters?

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:49.772
Two, does she make you laugh?

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:53.193
Three, is she a good person?

01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:56.738
Four, does she believe in God?

01:32:56.779 --> 01:32:59.282
If she covers those four bases,

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:02.118
that's probably

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:02.118
God talking to you.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.539
You're my boy, Jimmy,

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.539
forever and ever.

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:07.874
But never use

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:07.874
my death as an excuse

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:10.752
for not living your life

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:10.752
to the fullest.

01:33:10.793 --> 01:33:16.132
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:33:10.793 --> 01:33:16.132
my friend Jesus is calling me.

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:20.095
He has some incredible

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:20.095
assignments for me to do.

01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:23.848
I love you and don't

01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:23.848
forget our dance.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:26.059
I'll be waiting for you.

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:28.228
Love, Debbie.

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:31.647
P.S... get on with it, Jimmy.

01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:33.191
Get on with it.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.404
All right.

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:01.303
Let's check in with some

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:01.303
of our other contestants.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:08.393
Make that turn, yeah.

01:34:08.435 --> 01:34:09.727
That's it.

01:34:09.769 --> 01:34:11.605
So you're Gerald

01:34:09.769 --> 01:34:11.605
Hogwood II's dad?

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:15.525
Yup. Gerry Hog one,

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:15.525
and that's on my license plate.

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:17.152
- Oh.

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:17.152
- Mention that.

01:34:17.193 --> 01:34:18.403
It's on his license plate.

01:34:18.445 --> 01:34:19.904
- That's right.

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:21.197
So, what do you think

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:21.197
of his chances tonight?

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:22.907
Oh, this is a done deal.

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:24.493
You know, we got

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:24.493
a saying in the South--

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:26.536
Oh, you're from the South.

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:26.536
What part?

01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:29.289
Detroit, Michigan, yeah!

01:34:30.039 --> 01:34:31.583
I think that's the north.

01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:34.752
Well, that all depends on

01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:34.752
how you're holding the map.

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:37.464
But we got a saying down there,

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:37.464
and it goes like this.

01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:39.466
If anybody could,

01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:39.466
a Hogwood could.

01:34:39.508 --> 01:34:41.593
If anybody should,

01:34:39.508 --> 01:34:41.593
a Hogwood should.

01:34:41.635 --> 01:34:43.845
If anybody would,

01:34:41.635 --> 01:34:43.845
a Hogwood would.

01:34:43.886 --> 01:34:46.055
Roll Hogwoods!

01:34:46.097 --> 01:34:47.723
Yeah, woo, yeah!

01:34:49.559 --> 01:34:51.727
All right, well,

01:34:49.559 --> 01:34:51.727
good luck to you tonight.

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:54.022
Well, luck ain't got

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:54.022
nothing to do with it.

01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:56.191
That boy is all skill.

01:34:56.232 --> 01:34:57.942
Skill, skill, skill!

01:34:57.984 --> 01:34:58.985
Woo!

01:34:59.027 --> 01:35:00.987
Come on, go!

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:03.406
The Hogwoods,

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:03.406
ladies and gentlemen.

01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:06.700
Good evening, everyone.

01:35:06.742 --> 01:35:09.162
I have a short video

01:35:06.742 --> 01:35:09.162
presentation for all of you,

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:10.497
and I'd be happy

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:10.497
to answer any questions

01:35:10.539 --> 01:35:11.914
that you have afterwards.

01:35:11.956 --> 01:35:15.251
- Enjoy.

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:17.420
When babies are born,

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:17.420
parents hope for all

01:35:17.462 --> 01:35:19.548
that is good to come

01:35:17.462 --> 01:35:19.548
their way, but the vagaries

01:35:19.589 --> 01:35:22.758
of life leave no man

01:35:19.589 --> 01:35:22.758
or woman untouched.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.636
And oftentimes, a person

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.636
can feel that they

01:35:24.678 --> 01:35:27.930
are nothing more than

01:35:24.678 --> 01:35:27.930
a check mark in a box.

01:35:27.972 --> 01:35:30.724
We think your life is

01:35:27.972 --> 01:35:30.724
much more than a box.

01:35:30.766 --> 01:35:32.310
What's more interesting to you,

01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:35.397
a box with a check mark in it,

01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:35.397
or this?

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:38.483
I do believe in

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:38.483
love at first sight.

01:35:38.525 --> 01:35:40.985
I think that when you

01:35:38.525 --> 01:35:40.985
meet your true love

01:35:41.027 --> 01:35:44.698
for the first time,

01:35:41.027 --> 01:35:44.698
that fuse is lit.

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:48.201
And that flame of

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:48.201
love eventually makes

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:48.201
its way into your

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:51.663
heart and soul, and that's

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:51.663
where it stays forever.

01:35:51.705 --> 01:35:54.583
And we believe

01:35:51.705 --> 01:35:54.583
one thing is for certain,

01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:57.793
somewhere out there

01:35:54.624 --> 01:35:57.793
is another soul

01:35:57.835 --> 01:36:01.506
that is destined to

01:35:57.835 --> 01:36:01.506
unite with your soul.

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:04.008
You'll know it by looking at

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:04.008
that person, laughing with that

01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:08.221
person and falling

01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:08.221
in love with that person.

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:11.891
Wherever you're from,

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:11.891
whether you say "yasou"

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:16.229
or "cheers, mate"

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:16.229
or simply "I love you,"

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:18.981
there's a soul destined

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:18.981
to connect with your soul.

01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:22.026
I hope that there is a man

01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:22.026
out there somewhere who would

01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:26.906
look at me and know that,

01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:26.906
even though there are certain

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:32.662
things I'll never be, there

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:32.662
is a lot that I still am.

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:38.834
I'm a kind, loving, passionate

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:38.834
woman who loves to dance.

01:36:40.002 --> 01:36:42.088
So, if you think

01:36:40.002 --> 01:36:42.088
that type of person

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:44.591
is for you, let me know.

01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:47.260
Soul 2Soul.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:51.097
- Nice, very nice.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:51.097
- Nice, yeah.

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:52.265
There we go.

01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:55.017
Jimmy Hope is back.

01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:01.608
And

01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:01.608
here are your scores.

01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:05.612
We have an eight,

01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:05.612
a nine and an eight.

01:37:08.864 --> 01:37:10.450
Give it up.

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:12.160
Wow, ladies and gentleman,

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:12.160
that was fantastic.

01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:16.414
And now it's time for

01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:16.414
the last contestants.

01:37:16.456 --> 01:37:17.873
Where's your partner?

01:37:17.915 --> 01:37:20.335
I don't think he's

01:37:17.915 --> 01:37:20.335
making it tonight.

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:22.545
Uh, if he's not here

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:22.545
in the next 30 seconds,

01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:24.631
- you'll forfeit your spot.

01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:24.631
- Mm-hm.

01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:27.258
Ten seconds.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.636
Hold on, my dad's in the house.

01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:37.268
I got a spray tan from

01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:37.268
the neck down. I'm all in.

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:39.103
- Hey.

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:39.103
- Come on.

01:37:39.145 --> 01:37:41.063
Hold on.

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:48.446
Father, thank you

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:48.446
for this moment.

01:37:48.488 --> 01:37:51.700
I will never forget this time.

01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:54.910
But I especially thank you

01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:54.910
for what you've put on my heart.

01:37:55.662 --> 01:37:57.997
In Jesus' name, amen.

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:00.916
You've been on my heart.

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:04.878
From the moment you first

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:04.878
prayed in that restaurant.

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.758
God put you on my heart.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:12.595
And I don't know what's on

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:12.595
your heart, but I hope it's me.

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:15.557
Time for

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:15.557
the last contestants.

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:16.516
Come on.

01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:18.351
- One more thing.

01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:18.351
- What?

01:38:18.393 --> 01:38:20.687
- You lead.

01:38:18.393 --> 01:38:20.687
- Oh, no.

01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:21.895
No, no, no, no, no,

01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:21.895
no, no, no, no--

01:38:21.937 --> 01:38:23.231
- I'm serious.

01:38:21.937 --> 01:38:23.231
- No, no, no, no.

01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:24.858
- Don't joke around about that.

01:38:23.272 --> 01:38:24.858
- You lead.

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:27.777
- We are gonna lose, no.

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:27.777
- I'll follow, I'll follow.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:29.903
- Oh.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:29.903
- Dancers, take your positions.

01:38:29.945 --> 01:38:31.239
No.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.741
Now,

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.741
I'll pick the dance

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:34.492
you'll be asked

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:34.492
to perform tonight.

01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:41.290
The final dance you'll

01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:41.290
be dancing is... the tango.

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:43.835
Ugh, the tango?

01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:45.253
It's fine, it's fine.

01:38:45.294 --> 01:38:46.713
It means victory.

01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:48.631
What means victory?

01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:51.259
NI KA, it means victory.

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:55.971
Believe in him,

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:55.971
and you'll have victory.

01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:58.140
That was the message

01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:58.140
in the sky that day.

01:38:58.182 --> 01:38:59.684
How did you figure that out?

01:38:59.726 --> 01:39:01.644
I Googled it.

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:03.062
You Googled it?

01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:04.313
- I know, I know.

01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:04.313
- And now, ladies and gentlemen,

- Could you give us a moment?

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:11.237
Oh, you're killing me.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:12.321
How hard is it to pick a name?

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:14.240
Just give me your names.

01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:15.283
