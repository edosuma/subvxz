01:16.880 --> 01:18.029
William?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.235
Oh, hello, Julia.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.475
Afternoon, Dr Garland.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.711
Well, no need for formalities,
Detective. Please, call me Darcy.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.599
Yes, of course.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.390
Well, a delightful event. A country fair
in the midst of a metropolis.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.432
We just saw a horse pull.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.154
Please, Darcy, you make it sound
like a city of ruse.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.232
On the contrary.
I find Toronto a splendidly modern city.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.917
What are you looking at
so intensely, William?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.235
Dollhouses?

01:45.800 --> 01:48.712
It's more than that, Julia.
It's a miniature Toronto streetscape.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.756
It's unlike anything
I've ever seen before.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.475
It's won first prize.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.069
Deservedly.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.798
It's a most intriguing model.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.198
The faces of the
people have no features.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.435
How curious!

02:00.520 --> 02:01.953
The builder seems more
interested in the homes

02:02.040 --> 02:03.712
than the people who live in them.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.079
Julia, have a look at this.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.549
The attention to detail
is quite remarkable.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.232
It's more than remarkable, look.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.277
Ah, good heavens.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.515
What is it?

02:18.560 --> 02:21.279
The figure in that room
has a rifle.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.994
I believe we're looking
at a crime scene.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.113
The model was submitted
by a Bert Howland of Cherry Lane,

02:30.200 --> 02:31.679
according to the fair's organisers.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.352
Sir, where shall I put
these little figures?

02:33.440 --> 02:36.000
Uh, I believe they were
at the end of the street here, George.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.911
So there's someone holding a gun.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.718
What makes you think that
anyone was shot in that room?

02:40.280 --> 02:42.475
Consider the accuracy of scale,

02:42.560 --> 02:43.834
the attention to detail.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.029
I'll give you that.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.874
The builder put a gunman
in that upstairs room for a reason.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.111
Maybe this Bert Howland fellow
was having a bit of fun.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.157
An odd joke, if that's the case, sir.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.078
A piece of fiction, Murdoch.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.000
Don't you have
a real live case to work on?

03:22.320 --> 03:23.355
Morning.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.512
Don't you walk away from me!

03:31.520 --> 03:33.431
And where do you think you're going now?

03:33.960 --> 03:35.075
You know where I'm going.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.275
You go for lunch every day!

03:36.520 --> 03:37.873
Don't worry about me!

03:39.080 --> 03:42.072
The similarity to the model, sir,
it's... It's uncanny.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.714
It is indeed, George.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.836
We're about to meet
a very skilled craftsman.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.468
I believe Mr Howland lives
in number six here.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.992
- Mr Howland?
- Yeah.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.389
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.078
Was it you that confiscated the model?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.195
Yes.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.069
Excellent craftsmanship.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.470
A fine replica of your street here.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.556
May I ask why you saw fit
to take it to the station?

04:16.399 --> 04:19.755
A detail was added to the model
that I find most curious.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.507
A man holding a rifle.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.757
A rifle? You sure?

04:24.040 --> 04:27.749
Yes, yes. In the upstairs window
of your neighbour's house.

04:28.480 --> 04:33.349
Mr Howland, if I may, what was
your intention in building the model?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.434
I didn't build it.
That was my sister Lydia.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.870
Ah, may I speak with her then?

04:38.960 --> 04:40.029
I expect her any time.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.073
But that's puzzling. I don't recall
her adding any man with a rifle.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.074
Detective Murdoch, this is my sister.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.035
Hello.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.758
Don't mind her, she won't answer you.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.476
- Is she deaf?
- No, she's feeble-minded.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.551
Feeble-minded?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.719
There's other things that she's called,
but that's what it comes down to.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.349
Yet she's capable of building
such an intricate model.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.708
Did you help her?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.593
I grabbed the wood and such,
but she, uh, works by herself.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.516
When did she begin to build the model?

05:28.640 --> 05:29.709
About a year ago.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.869
Detective...

05:33.680 --> 05:34.795
Lydia?

05:35.120 --> 05:37.315
I'm a policeman and I need your help.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.469
Don't... Don't get too near her now.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.116
Do you recall
building the model of your street?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.950
You don't want her upset.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.155
Do you remember, Lydia?

05:45.720 --> 05:48.951
It's okay, Lydia. It's okay, shh.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.317
Let's go inside, come inside...

05:52.200 --> 05:54.270
Come inside. It's okay, it's okay...

05:57.520 --> 05:59.476
I'm sorry if my questions disturbed her.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.595
Lydia has her own ways.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.109
She doesn't like people much.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.679
Excuse me, I need to see her.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.357
George, begin canvassing the neighbours.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.238
Find out if anyone knows anything
about a shooting at number seven.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.469
Yes, sir.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.391
A shooting? In my house?

06:41.080 --> 06:44.117
Oh, now,
you're just pulling my leg, Detective.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.591
Mrs Galbraith, Lydia Howland
built a model of this street

06:48.720 --> 06:51.757
and put a man holding a gun
in your upstairs room.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.352
Lydia did that, did she?

06:55.120 --> 06:56.189
Yes.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.679
Do you own a gun, Mrs Galbraith?

06:58.400 --> 06:59.799
My hubby Mr Galbraith does.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.276
- A rifle?
- Yes,

07:02.440 --> 07:04.192
though it's not been fired in years.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.078
I'll need to speak with him.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.709
He's practising at the lodge.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.194
Practising?

07:10.280 --> 07:12.555
He plays the trombone
in the Orange Lodge band.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.798
Ah, well, I'll need to speak with him.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.556
About a fictitious gunman?

07:17.720 --> 07:20.075
Lydia is not
in her right mind, Detective.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.430
I'm not saying
Bert isn't trying his best, but...

07:24.640 --> 07:26.198
...his wife left him.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.830
"It's your sister or it's me," she told
him, and, frankly, I don't blame her.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.070
That daft girl should be
in one of those institutions!

07:32.840 --> 07:34.319
Thank you, Mrs Galbraith.

07:36.760 --> 07:37.715
What have you, George?

07:37.800 --> 07:40.109
Well, sir, I've spoken
to several people.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.397
Uh, Mr Caruso lives in
number five with his wife.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.438
He's very particular about his peach
tree, which I find suspicious in itself.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.317
Peach trees are very difficult
to care for in our climate...

07:48.400 --> 07:50.516
George, carry on.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.719
Uh, the Carusos haven't heard
any gunshots.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.349
Who lives in number three?

07:55.520 --> 07:58.512
That would be Felix Roach, a bachelor.
He repairs furniture.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.876
Uh, the Draper family
lives in number two,

08:00.960 --> 08:02.109
and there was no answer at number four.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.874
Seems like a very close community

08:04.960 --> 08:06.951
where everybody's very trusting,
nobody locks their doors,

08:07.440 --> 08:09.158
and nobody knows anything
about a shooting.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.349
Hmm.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.354
Mr Galbraith at number seven
does own a rifle.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.039
So do a lot of people, Murdoch.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.549
I've checked the police records.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.949
There's no report of any shooting
at 7 Cherry Lane.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.268
I find it very hard to believe

08:25.360 --> 08:27.590
that such a precise model
was built by an imbecile.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.671
Ooh, sir, I believe people such as Lydia
are no longer referred to as "imbecile".

08:32.760 --> 08:34.352
It's felt to be demeaning.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.710
- The correct term nowadays is "moron".
- Oh.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.479
Well, I'm not sure either term fits
in this particular instance.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.313
Isn't it likely that she invented
this gunman character?

08:42.440 --> 08:45.159
Someone would've heard a gunshot
on such a small street as Cherry Lane.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.832
Just return it
to its rightful owner, Murdoch,

08:47.920 --> 08:50.229
and get on with some proper police work.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.149
- Yes, sir.
- I'll pack it up, sir.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.715
Just a moment, George.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.274
What are you looking at, sir?

09:03.720 --> 09:05.790
The figure holding the gun, George.

09:06.360 --> 09:10.035
He seems disproportionate compared
to the other people on the street.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.315
Why would that be?

09:12.960 --> 09:17.272
Let's pay another visit to Cherry Lane,
and we'll need to access the armoury.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.429
Yes, sir.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.956
Right,
move further back, George.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.353
Counter clockwise.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.875
Now left.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.553
Your other left, George.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.395
No.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.311
The figure in the model
is completely different.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.038
Much smaller.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.589
George, please ask Mrs Galbraith
to grace us with her presence.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.795
Yes, sir.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.876
So, right here, Mrs Galbraith?

09:59.200 --> 10:01.475
Yes, I moved the mirror
a month or so ago.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.754
What of it?

10:03.280 --> 10:05.111
We appreciate your help, Mrs Galbraith.

10:06.360 --> 10:10.194
Well, just remember you're carrying
it back downstairs before you leave.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.558
So, sir, how did you know
there was a mirror in the room?

10:16.320 --> 10:19.517
It's the only logical explanation
for the small man, George.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.917
Lydia saw the shooter
reflected in the mirror.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.793
Why would that make him small?

10:25.160 --> 10:26.195
Well, George,

10:26.280 --> 10:28.475
the apparent distance
of a reflected object

10:28.560 --> 10:30.676
is always greater
when seen through a mirror.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.352
Lydia was across the street.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.552
Therefore the reflected object she saw,

10:37.640 --> 10:40.234
in this case the shooter,
appeared smaller.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.791
So then, sir, if she saw
the reflection of the shooter

10:42.880 --> 10:44.233
that means he was not
actually standing here

10:44.320 --> 10:46.959
at the far side of the room,
but rather...

10:49.360 --> 10:51.749
Over here, hidden from the street.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.838
Yes, George, raise the rifle,
if you would, please.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.395
- Oh, but then the angle is wrong.
- Hmm. Completely wrong.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.194
Sir, if Lydia depicted
the back of the shooter,

11:03.160 --> 11:04.832
he would be more like...

11:10.480 --> 11:12.072
Exactly, that's it, George.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.797
Don't move a muscle.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.110
The putty around this pane
is a different colour.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.270
So this pane
has been replaced.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.038
Let's see if the owner can
shed some light on the situation.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.751
I don't know anything about
a broken window, Detective.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.717
How long have
you resided here, Mrs Gordon?

11:41.840 --> 11:42.875
Eight months.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.474
And who lived here previously?

11:44.920 --> 11:45.955
It used to be a boarding house.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.597
And do you know who
the previous owners were?

11:48.720 --> 11:50.358
Yes, she lives across the street.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.638
- Oh. Which house?
- Number five.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.189
She married Mr Caruso.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.189
He's Italian.

11:57.640 --> 11:58.675
A fruit pedlar.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.759
Wooed his wife with his peaches,
so the neighbours say.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.471
May we come inside, Mrs Gordon?

12:09.080 --> 12:12.231
So, if the bullet travelled
without interference,

12:12.920 --> 12:14.751
this would be the trajectory.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.758
But, sir, what if the bullet
entered the victim and struck bone?

12:17.840 --> 12:19.876
Would that not change
the path of the bullet?

12:20.320 --> 12:22.550
- Well, yes, George.
- Uh, like, say...

12:24.280 --> 12:25.429
This!

12:26.080 --> 12:29.197
Or, sir, quite conceivably, even, uh,

12:30.520 --> 12:31.555
that.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.473
Yes, conceivably, George.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.358
Assuming that there
even was a victim, sir.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.191
But if it missed its intended target...

12:38.280 --> 12:39.349
Uh, sir, if I may...

12:39.480 --> 12:41.789
What if the bullet entered the victim
and lodged there?

12:41.960 --> 12:43.996
It would still be inside him or her.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.595
Yes, George,
but if it missed its target...

12:46.680 --> 12:49.148
Or went through a soft, fleshy part
of the poor devil.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.514
Then I might find it...

12:50.600 --> 12:53.319
Supposed it could have missed
the breast bone exiting between ribs...

12:53.560 --> 12:55.516
Or even, sir, if he was sitting
next to the window,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.955
perhaps in through one temple
and straight out through the other.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.874
I suppose, then,
there would be an off-chance

13:00.960 --> 13:03.269
- that the bullet would end up...
- Here.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.709
A slug from a rifle.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.197
George, go to number seven
and collect Mr Galbraith's rifle.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.635
Yes, sir.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.355
That's not a sound
you'd forget in a hurry, sir.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.429
No.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.275
Yet everyone on Cherry Lane claims
they didn't hear the sound of a gunshot.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.035
We have a match.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.315
So Mr Galbraith's rifle fired the shot.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.358
Yes, George, but we still need
evidence of foul play.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.032
But, sir,
if Mrs Gordon is telling the truth,

13:44.120 --> 13:46.588
then that bullet has been in the wall
for the last eight months.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.318
I can't imagine
we'll find any evidence on it.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.076
Well, perhaps what is hidden to us,
a little science can reveal.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.830
I suppose this is the science, sir?

13:57.040 --> 13:58.917
Yes, George,
it's part of it. A chemical.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.032
Thi-nitrothol hydrozide.

14:01.880 --> 14:06.317
In this case, it's reduced to an
amino group with sodium dithionite.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.632
Now, the chemical lies dormant
until it's activated again.

14:12.120 --> 14:17.114
In this case, with an oxidant

14:19.560 --> 14:24.076
making chemi-phosphoro-luminescence.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.076
And I suppose we're looking
for traces of blood, sir?

14:27.360 --> 14:28.429
Indeed, George.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.596
Now, this compound
was recently synthesised,

14:30.680 --> 14:33.114
but I managed to acquire a small sample.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.315
Now, if any chemical traces
of blood remain

14:38.600 --> 14:41.353
the solution will react
with the iron in the haemoglobin.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.839
In the haemo-goblin.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.953
Sir, this bullet went through somebody.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.438
Yes, George, but the question is, who?

15:04.760 --> 15:08.469
Mr Galbraith, we found a bullet
fired from your rifle with blood on it.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.879
- Where?
- Across the street from your house.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.630
I don't know anything
about that.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.192
My wife had no business
giving my gun to you.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.317
Your rifle may have been used
as a murder weapon, Mr Galbraith.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.392
- How do you explain that?
- I have never fired the thing, not once.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.552
I find that difficult to believe, sir.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.715
It belonged to my father!

15:28.240 --> 15:29.912
It was his hunting rifle.
Ask anyone on the street.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.232
Partial to rabbit stew, he was.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.190
In this case,
the victim may have been human.

15:36.280 --> 15:41.832
Well, tell me then, who did
I kill, when did I do it and why?

15:45.120 --> 15:46.348
The man has a point.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.315
You don't have a timeline,
you don't have a motive,

15:49.720 --> 15:52.075
and apart from a rifle slug
with a modicum of blood on it,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.435
you don't even have proof that
a crime was even committed.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.589
You need a body, Murdoch.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.477
Sirs, have a look at this.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.797
There's a darker patch of earth
right here.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.070
If that represents freshly-turned soil,
it could be a grave.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.549
What's the logic of that?

16:04.840 --> 16:06.831
Well, sir, if Lydia
saw the shooting take place,

16:06.920 --> 16:08.672
perhaps she also saw
the body being buried.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.678
Excellent reasoning, George.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.478
Thank you, sir. I'll fetch a shovel.

16:40.880 --> 16:41.915
Oh, my!

16:43.720 --> 16:44.789
My goodness!

16:45.440 --> 16:46.509
Well, it's a body, all right.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.994
- Looks like a...
- What are you doing with my cat?

16:50.400 --> 16:53.597
Calm yourself, Mr Roach,
we're just continuing our investigation.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.313
He lived to a ripe old age
and he deserves his rest.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.039
I wonder...

17:25.560 --> 17:26.628
George!

17:27.560 --> 17:30.028
- Sir?
- Have a look at this.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.869
It's unbelievable.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.474
Her attention to minutia is staggering.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.790
Or perhaps, sir,
she's just fond of cats.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.319
She is childlike in some regards.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.958
Perhaps she has an affinity
toward animals.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.629
They can't speak either.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.109
Hmm.

17:47.800 --> 17:48.869
Doctor.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.429
Constable.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.748
So, you discovered a murder took place
on your model street after all.

17:55.120 --> 17:59.989
Yes, I've determined a murder weapon
and a vague timeline, but no body.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.314
That's inconvenient.
Did you find out who built this?

18:03.760 --> 18:07.116
Yes. The model was built by
a young woman named Lydia Howland.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.517
Feeble-minded, it's believed.

18:09.920 --> 18:13.595
Yet she's capable of extraordinary
skill and focus, as you can see.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.233
I heard of such a case
when I was at the children's hospital.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.798
I wonder
if your Lydia is an idiot savant.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.238
She's deficient,
yet possesses one area of brilliance.

18:24.920 --> 18:25.955
Really.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.353
It would explain
why her figures have no features.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.555
How do you mean?

18:30.640 --> 18:33.757
I've been haunted by these blank faces,
now I understand.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.675
She can't read emotion.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.918
Human faces cause her great confusion,
so she simply ignores them.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.272
You and I communicate with eye contact,
but Lydia can't do that.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.793
Uh, thank you very much, Julia.
This has been very helpful.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.118
Clearly I went about my first meeting
with Lydia all wrong.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.231
And you think
that she witnessed a murder?

18:57.520 --> 19:00.318
Yes, but I have no body.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.673
Well, I'll start searching for
unidentified shooting victims

19:03.760 --> 19:04.909
in the morgue records.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.470
Thank you.
I'll try to narrow my timeline.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.433
Sir, the shooting occurred

19:15.520 --> 19:18.637
before the Gordons bought the former
boarding house at number four.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.597
Assuming Mrs Gordon
was telling the truth.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.999
Well, I checked with city records, sir,

19:22.080 --> 19:24.275
and Mrs Caruso did sell the house
eight months ago.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.830
We need to determine which boarders
left without notice prior to that date.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.512
Looking for wayward
boarding-house tenants?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.192
Now, there's a bloody
needle in a haystack.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.748
George, check with Mrs Caruso.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.831
See if she has a good memory
of past boarders.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.070
- Sir, will do.
- Oh, and, sir,

19:38.160 --> 19:39.832
I'm bringing Lydia down to the station.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.797
What for? She can't tell you anything.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.957
Perhaps she can communicate
in other ways.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.551
Our small street is
the only world she knows.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.679
Without any features on the figures,
how does she know who belongs where?

19:57.440 --> 19:58.998
She has an order in her head.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.635
Maybe it's the way she dresses each one,
I don't know.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.396
Do your neighbours know
how talented your sister is?

20:05.400 --> 20:07.391
No, they ignore her, at best.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.348
Some complain of
her walking up and down the street,

20:10.840 --> 20:14.037
but God knows she doesn't disturb
anyone. She hasn't talked in 25 years.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.833
She spoke as a child?

20:17.240 --> 20:19.356
Yeah, she seemed normal
for the first year or so,

20:19.440 --> 20:21.715
apparently,
and then she gradually withdrew.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.517
She hasn't uttered a word since.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.236
No doctor could provide an explanation,

20:27.480 --> 20:29.630
and my parents went to their graves
not knowing what was wrong.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.875
When did she add the detail
of the gunman to the model?

20:34.560 --> 20:35.595
I don't know.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.390
I never noticed the figure
until you showed me.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.719
And it just shocks me to think
that image was in her head.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.115
It's all right, my dear. It's all right.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.357
It's all right, my dear. It's all right.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.594
It's all right.
Let's pick up those chess pieces.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.910
It's all right, it's all right.
Let's pick these up.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.794
That's it,
let's pick up these chess pieces.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.554
You see, there you go,
Lydia, everything is fine.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.955
Everything is fine.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.189
That's it.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.908
She likes simple tasks. They calm her.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.395
That's it.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.949
That's extraordinary.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.474
She's putting back
every piece as it was.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.998
You know, she has excellent recall.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.239
She memorised the game?

21:38.520 --> 21:41.751
That's it. Shh.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.276
It's clear that Lydia is
very sensitive to sudden, loud noises.

21:49.720 --> 21:50.789
Like the gunshot?

21:51.680 --> 21:54.717
Yes, I believe
the gunshot so traumatised her,

21:54.800 --> 21:57.314
that when she made the model,
she recreated the shooting

21:57.400 --> 21:59.630
exactly how she saw
the street, at that moment.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.395
Even though she didn't understand
the meaning of the sound.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.515
That's correct.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.878
So now what? She'll build a model
of the station house at the exact moment

22:06.960 --> 22:09.030
that the two clumsy constables
bumped into one another?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.195
Oh, I don't think so, sir.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.832
Bert was there to calm her
and distract her with the chess pieces.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.877
When the shooting occurred,
she was all alone.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.518
Making the event an even greater trauma.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.195
I believe so.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.878
I still can't fathom Lydia
building this by herself.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.477
Well, sir, it's not without precedent.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.155
Have a look at this.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.669
That's bloody impressive.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.955
This model was built
by James Henry Pullen.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.076
A man believed to be an imbecile
who couldn't hear or speak.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.830
He built it while living
in an English insane asylum.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.237
And you think
Lydia has the same ability?

22:43.720 --> 22:45.517
- So it would seem, sir.
- Hmm.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.917
Can you tap into what she's thinking?

22:48.320 --> 22:50.436
I don't know if anyone can do that, sir.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.036
Well, if your theory's correct, Murdoch,

22:55.120 --> 22:58.351
there may be clues within the model
that you haven't yet seen.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.358
What are you all looking at?

23:57.080 --> 23:59.719
<i>Mrs Caruso
was very helpful, sir.</i>

23:59.880 --> 24:02.553
<i>I have a list of all the tenants who
left the boarding house without notice.</i>

24:03.280 --> 24:04.395
<i>Sir.</i>

24:04.760 --> 24:05.954
Sir!

24:07.840 --> 24:08.875
Yes, George?

24:09.080 --> 24:10.513
I'm afraid there are seven of them, sir.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.478
The inspector was right, tracking them
all down will be next to impossible...

24:13.560 --> 24:16.791
Did any of them leave
on or around June 22, 1897?

24:17.440 --> 24:19.510
That's a very specific date, sir.
May I ask why?

24:19.720 --> 24:23.554
George, when was the last time there was
bunting in the streets of Toronto?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.958
Well, I suppose that would be
Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.873
Did anyone leave the boarding house
around June 22nd?

24:33.200 --> 24:34.394
Yes, sir.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.436
A Grant Abrahams.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.997
I remember it like it was yesterday.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.113
All of us gathered at the end
of the street to watch the parade.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.794
All except the anti-royalist Abrahams.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.349
He was miserable to the core.
He stayed behind in his room.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.831
And when did you discover he had gone?

24:51.960 --> 24:53.188
He left that night.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.952
Broke a window and stole a carpet.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.395
- A carpet?
- Yes, a good one.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.358
Did you see the broken window
that night?

25:00.440 --> 25:02.192
No, it was the next morning.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.152
It was shattered glass everywhere.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.718
Do you know of anyone
who may have wanted to harm him?

25:09.320 --> 25:12.756
Well, Abrahams did odd jobs
for Mrs Galbraith in number seven

25:12.840 --> 25:14.831
when Mr Galbraith was at work.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.798
Now, I can't say exactly
what those jobs were, Detective,

25:18.520 --> 25:21.592
but when Mr Galbraith found out,
there was a real set-to between the men

25:21.680 --> 25:22.999
right in the middle of the street.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.469
What it is?

25:26.640 --> 25:28.756
I was just talking
to the detective, Angelo.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.191
Talk, but not gossip, huh?

25:35.080 --> 25:37.196
I don't think the Galbraiths
have the best marriage.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.075
Mr Galbraith,

25:45.840 --> 25:48.400
I now believe the murder victim
on Cherry Lane

25:48.480 --> 25:50.436
is a man named Grant Abrahams,

25:51.000 --> 25:52.831
a man you had reason to kill.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.795
Don't be ridiculous.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.072
You deny he had designs on your wife?

25:58.520 --> 26:01.398
Designs on her?
No, he had his hands on her.

26:01.840 --> 26:02.989
I saw it with my own eyes.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.758
- Well, how did you respond?
- I beat him soundly.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.118
Cuffed him, good and proper,
right in the street.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.153
But you continued
to harbour resentment toward him.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.958
Any man would, Detective.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.835
Let's talk about Jubilee Day
and the parade.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.672
- Jubilee Day?
- Yes.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.196
The Jubilee parade went by Cherry Lane,
did it not?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.355
Yes.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.559
And everyone gathered at the end
of the street to watch the parade.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.314
Everyone but Abrahams.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.755
Well, the lecher made no secret
of his disliking the monarchy.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.351
You knew he wouldn't be
watching the parade.

26:35.480 --> 26:36.799
What are you getting at?

26:36.880 --> 26:39.235
While everyone was distracted
by the festivities,

26:39.320 --> 26:40.958
you returned to your house...

26:41.240 --> 26:42.355
Begging your pardon, Detective.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.670
And shot Abrahams
with your hunting rifle.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.359
You're right.
I wasn't watching the parade.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.749
Just as I suspected.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.235
I play
in the Orange Lodge band, Detective.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.238
I was in the parade.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.151
I remember the Orange Lodge parade
on Jubilee Day.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.276
They marched down Queen Street
for three solid hours.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.232
The only thing that Galbraith
was murdering that day

27:08.320 --> 27:09.673
<i>was The Maple Leaf Forever.</i>

27:09.800 --> 27:11.836
Good one, sir.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.599
Trumpet? That's interesting.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.591
According to his wife,
Galbraith played the trombone.

27:16.280 --> 27:20.398
Trumpet, trombone, triangle. Either way,
he didn't fire the rifle, so who did?

27:20.800 --> 27:22.950
Likely another one
of the Cherry Lane residents

27:23.040 --> 27:24.439
who knew Galbraith had the gun.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.791
And used the vantage point of
the Galbraiths' house to shoot Abrahams.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.993
Sir, I believe the murder was meant
to coincide with the parade.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.152
I checked into the parade route, sir.
It went along Queen Street East

27:34.240 --> 27:36.879
passing the end of Cherry Lane
between 4:00 and 4:25 p.m.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.394
But, if everyone was together
watching the parade,

27:39.480 --> 27:41.471
will they all provide alibis
for each other?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.353
Time to have a chat with the neighbours.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.828
Yes, we were all at the end
of the street, except for Lydia.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.153
Did she stay at the house?

27:50.240 --> 27:52.595
She was sitting in her usual spot
on the porch.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.148
The commotion was overwhelming for her.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.670
Did you know Grant Abrahams, Mr Howland?

27:59.240 --> 28:01.515
- We all knew Abrahams.
- Why is that?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.877
He was a troubled man who took pleasure
in finding fault in everyone.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.874
- And we all seemed to annoy him.
- In what way?

28:09.160 --> 28:11.435
Mr Galbraith
played his trombone too loudly.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.273
Mr Roach's cat
sat in his windowsill too often.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.835
Mr Caruso
parked his fruit cart all wrong.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.393
Did you argue with Abrahams?

28:18.760 --> 28:21.149
He didn't like Lydia
walking past his window.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.472
- So you fought.
- More than once.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.156
So, if it's suspects you're looking for,
I'd be on that list.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.436
Did anyone else have reason
to dislike Abrahams?

28:32.280 --> 28:33.679
Do you know about him and Mrs Galbraith?

28:34.200 --> 28:36.077
I do. What about it?

28:36.320 --> 28:38.595
Well, after Mr Galbraith found out,

28:38.680 --> 28:40.750
Abrahams turned his affections
to Mrs Draper,

28:40.840 --> 28:43.877
and Mrs Galbraith was
none too happy about that.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.876
Yes, Mr Abrahams did
take a shine to Mrs Draper.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.153
Such a bird-like creature
with a nervous disposition.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.471
I never understood the attraction.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.314
But you felt spurned.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.156
My personal feelings are
no business of the Toronto Constabulary.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.595
They are when I'm investigating
a murder, Mrs Galbraith.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.313
Now, where were you the afternoon
of Jubilee Day?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.433
What are you suggesting?

29:12.360 --> 29:15.477
I was watching my husband in the Orange
Lodge band like everyone else.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.115
Who saw you?

29:18.080 --> 29:19.195
Just about everyone.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.359
If you're looking for a killer,
you should talk to Mr Draper.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.909
Why is that?

29:25.720 --> 29:27.358
He was very upset with Mr Abrahams.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.958
He's very protective of his little wife.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.673
And were the Drapers at the parade?

29:32.760 --> 29:34.432
Yes. Oh...

29:35.560 --> 29:37.073
As I recall.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.393
Abrahams was a cruel man.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.789
He relished in upsetting Mrs Draper
with his lewd taunts.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.432
So you disliked Abrahams.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.989
Couldn't stand the man.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.355
Enough to kill him?

29:50.440 --> 29:53.910
God, no. It wasn't me.
I've never used a gun in my life.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.430
Well, someone shot Mr Abrahams,
Mr Draper.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.196
Look at Mr Caruso at number five.
He had good reason to kill Abrahams.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.311
Oh, why do you say that?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.914
Well, it all started
when Abrahams teased Caruso,

30:05.000 --> 30:06.877
stealing peaches from his tree.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.070
Caruso almost stabbed him
with his pruning shears,

30:09.160 --> 30:13.278
then his shed went up in flames.
He almost lost his whole house.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.678
When did this happen?

30:16.880 --> 30:21.670
Well, their feud escalated over time.
The fire was last June.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.038
Abrahams is a rude man,

30:24.600 --> 30:26.511
disrespectful of my property.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.229
So you attacked him?

30:29.160 --> 30:32.436
I tell him, stop. He laugh.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.715
He lucky I no stab him in his heart.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.517
Did Mr Abrahams burn down your shed?

30:40.600 --> 30:43.194
<i>Mannaggia! Who else do?</i>

30:44.560 --> 30:46.790
Where were you at 4:00 p.m.
on Jubilee Day?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.116
I was watching the parade.

30:50.800 --> 30:51.869
Who saw you?

30:54.480 --> 31:00.316
I think Mr Roach stand with me,
I no sure.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.990
But why are you asking about Mr Caruso?
He's a good man.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.993
- Was he watching the parade?
- Oh, yes, he was there.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.516
What can you tell me
about Grant Abrahams?

31:14.480 --> 31:16.630
He was a man who didn't work enough.

31:16.720 --> 31:20.076
So he would just sit in his window
and argue with everyone.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.159
He picked on the weak.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.239
Did you have a problem with him?

31:25.360 --> 31:31.833
Me? Oh, no, I had no personal grievance,
but I was glad when he left.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.395
Why?

31:33.480 --> 31:35.835
I don't like
my neighbours upset, Detective,

31:35.960 --> 31:38.394
and that's exactly what he did.
He upset everyone.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.559
He turned our street upside down.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.839
All of the residents
of Cherry Lane

31:45.920 --> 31:47.672
were watching the Jubilee Day parade.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.113
All of them vouch for each other

31:49.200 --> 31:51.668
and most of them have motive
to kill Abrahams.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.269
A close-knit community
with no shortage of motives.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.631
Have you thought that this could
be a conspiracy, Murdoch?

31:56.760 --> 31:59.149
Every one of them getting together
to rid the streets of Abrahams.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.839
I have given that some thought, sir.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.912
Which would explain why
no one heard the shot

32:03.000 --> 32:05.389
or saw the body removed.
They're all bloody well in on it.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.235
Sirs.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.789
What is it, George?

32:09.080 --> 32:11.196
Eight people claim they were
watching the parade that day.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.590
Mrs Galbraith, Mr and Mrs Caruso,

32:14.840 --> 32:18.310
Felix Roach, Bert Howland, Mr Draper
with his wife and son.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.072
We know that, Crabtree.
What's your point?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.354
Well, look at the model, sir.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.158
There are only seven figures
at the end of the street.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.151
If Lydia is as precise
as we think she is,

32:25.560 --> 32:28.438
that means one of the residents of
Cherry Lane wasn't watching the parade.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.711
Which means the missing person
is the gunman.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.268
- Or woman.
- But who was it?

32:36.520 --> 32:38.954
Julia, I've reached
an impasse in this case,

32:39.440 --> 32:42.034
yet I'm certain that Lydia holds
the key to solving it.

32:42.640 --> 32:43.993
But you can't communicate with her.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.992
No, and that's the frustration.

32:46.560 --> 32:49.028
I believe she sees the world differently
than the rest of us.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.235
She does.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.830
Some areas of her mind
are sharply focused

32:52.920 --> 32:55.912
while others don't
seem to function at all.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.230
Because idiot savants
are oblivious to other people,

32:58.320 --> 32:59.673
they're quite single-minded

32:59.760 --> 33:02.399
and therefore capable of
extraordinary accomplishments.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.516
That describes Lydia exactly.

33:04.920 --> 33:10.199
A mysterious combination of emotional
unawareness and acute intellect.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.750
That's a good description
of someone I know.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.115
How can I communicate
across such a void?

33:16.840 --> 33:18.796
What about using the world she created?

33:20.440 --> 33:22.396
- Did Lydia put herself in her model?
- No.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.508
No, I don't believe she did.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.351
That's interesting.
She has no concept of self?

33:29.200 --> 33:31.316
Julia, I think you've hit on something.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.513
- Darcy!
- Hello.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.468
Sorry, I'm interrupting.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.316
No! Not at all, I was just leaving.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.109
Good night.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.111
I hope our discussion was fruitful.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.549
Good night.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.197
This is Cherry Lane
on the day of the Jubilee parade.

34:26.679 --> 34:29.069
A street you know very well.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.994
This is Lydia.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.232
Lydia lives

34:38.560 --> 34:39.629
here.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.275
Yes?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.389
There. Lydia is home.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.795
But who are the other people?
And where do they live?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.475
I think

35:12.120 --> 35:13.872
that this is Bert.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.790
Bert lives here with Lydia.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.274
All right, that's not Bert.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.275
Hmm.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.558
This looks like a young lad.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.038
I think this is Tommy Draper.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.236
Tommy lives here.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.269
Right.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.555
Maybe this is Bert.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.469
Mr...

36:12.080 --> 36:13.479
Mr Draper

36:17.400 --> 36:20.039
Mr Draper. George, please, if you would?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.829
Then, maybe this is Bert.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.510
Now, Bert is home.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.109
Mrs Draper.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.192
George, Mrs Galbraith.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.955
Mrs Draper.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.474
Mrs Caruso.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.789
Mrs Draper, then.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.715
Mrs Draper.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.631
This must be Felix Roach.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.354
Mr Caruso.

37:30.800 --> 37:31.869
George.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.635
Felix Roach?

37:37.720 --> 37:39.870
The only person on the street
with no motive.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.915
What if this is all
some kind of a game, Murdoch?

37:50.240 --> 37:53.232
Sir, I don't think Lydia understands
the concept of games.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.317
Even if she's right,
and Roach is the murderer,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.914
we can't arrest him
without evidence, Murdoch.

38:00.360 --> 38:04.035
You need hard facts, not some airy-fairy
theory based on a woman who can't talk.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.235
And what about his alibi?

38:05.640 --> 38:07.676
He was watching the parade with
everyone else, was he not?

38:09.520 --> 38:10.589
Perhaps he wasn't.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.152
But I've already told you
where I was, Detective.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.678
Check with Mr Caruso.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.309
Mr Caruso's memory is somewhat foggy.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.995
So, you saw the Orange Lodge band go by
the end of Cherry Lane?

38:25.440 --> 38:26.998
Plain as the nose on my face.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.994
Perhaps you can tell me, what instrument
was Mr Galbraith playing?

38:32.680 --> 38:33.749
A trombone.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.754
Are you sure?

38:35.840 --> 38:37.876
Of course. He's played it for years.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.077
Not on Jubilee Day, he didn't.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.279
What do you mean?

38:47.600 --> 38:50.068
The trumpeter came down with influenza.

38:50.160 --> 38:54.676
Mr Galbraith filled in and played
the trumpet, not the trombone.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.793
I could have sworn that he was...

38:56.880 --> 38:58.950
You never saw the parade,
did you, Mr Roach?

38:59.320 --> 39:00.992
Of course I did! I just didn't remember

39:01.080 --> 39:03.036
that Galbraith was playing
a different brass instrument.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.554
I find that most curious, Mr Roach.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.518
Are you going to arrest me, Detective?

39:13.840 --> 39:15.512
A John Doe, shot through the neck,

39:15.600 --> 39:18.353
was found in a railway car in Ottawa
on June 26th.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.749
A few days after Grant Abrahams
disappeared. This sounds promising.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.952
The train had come from Toronto
and the body was wrapped in a carpet.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.435
That sounds like our victim.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.432
I'm sorry I can't give you
any further details,

39:29.640 --> 39:32.950
Mr Abrahams now being a skeleton in
a pauper's grave,

39:33.040 --> 39:34.917
but I'll continue
to look through the file.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.109
Thank you, Julia.

39:40.320 --> 39:44.029
That's Grant Abrahams
and that's my carpet.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.634
Thank you, Mrs Caruso.
This is most helpful.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.794
A body and a positive identification.
Now we're getting somewhere.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.032
How did Roach get the body onto a train?

39:54.320 --> 39:57.357
Sir, I believe Roach moved
Abrahams' body in his cart

39:57.440 --> 40:00.637
while everyone was asleep
after the day's revelries

40:00.800 --> 40:04.839
and dumped his body in a railway car
at the Booth Street railway siding

40:04.920 --> 40:06.319
half a block from Cherry Lane.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.595
You're almost there, Murdoch.
Almost got him.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.436
Not quite, sir.
I still don't have a motive.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.193
William, am I interrupting?

40:20.640 --> 40:21.834
Julia, of course not.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.273
I've been through the John Doe file.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.555
I must say
the Ottawa coroner was quite thorough.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.869
Look at these.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.075
Oh, my!

40:28.160 --> 40:30.833
These wounds to
Abrahams' arms are quite curious.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.358
The coroner posited they were defensive.
Could that be possible?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.795
Well, it's possible, but not likely.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.591
Abrahams was shot
from across the street.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.309
Whatever happened,
they were inflicted before he died.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.830
Hmm. Defensive wounds to both forearms.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.112
There's also evidence of inflammation,

40:48.200 --> 40:50.111
as though Abrahams
had an allergic reaction

40:50.200 --> 40:51.269
to whatever injured him.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.915
Could it be a reaction to some kind
of metal? Nickel, perhaps?

40:56.960 --> 40:59.838
I've seen a similar response,
of all things, to cat scratches.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.149
Cat?

41:02.960 --> 41:04.109
He lived to a ripe old age.

41:04.840 --> 41:05.909
He deserves his rest.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.996
Julia, I think I have another body
for you to look at.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.668
Well, the cat's hyoid was fractured.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.037
- The cat was throttled.
- Yes.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.709
Strangled to death? That's horrible.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.788
The cat would have experienced
the frightening sensation of air hunger

41:22.880 --> 41:24.313
and, no doubt, struggled violently.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.438
Fighting for its life,
the poor, little thing.

41:26.600 --> 41:27.999
Clawing at the killer's arms.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.230
Mr Roach claimed his cat
died of old age.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.349
Mr Roach's cat
sat on his windowsill too often.

41:37.680 --> 41:38.954
That's why Roach killed Abrahams.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.029
What do you mean?

41:41.240 --> 41:43.037
Roach's cat annoyed Abrahams.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.190
Perhaps Mr Abrahams strangled the cat

41:45.280 --> 41:48.272
and, in retaliation,
Mr Roach shot Abrahams.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.354
Would the death of a cat be
sufficient motive for murder?

41:51.480 --> 41:54.153
Yes. As a pet owner, Doctor,
I'll vouch for that.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.354
Right then, George, head down to
Cherry Lane and impound Mr Roach's cart.

41:59.440 --> 42:00.919
I'll meet you at the station house.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.149
Yes, sir.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.514
Once again, thank you, Doctor.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.309
Sir!

42:16.040 --> 42:17.439
Felix Roach's cart.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.873
It looks to see
an awful lot of use, sir.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.678
I can't imagine any trace evidence

42:21.760 --> 42:23.990
from a body could still be found
after all this time.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.589
Well, let's see, George.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.719
Assuming the body was put in head-first.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.156
Lift up the handles please, George.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.713
Oh, yes, I see what you mean.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.791
Blood from any wound would
run down to the end there.

42:36.880 --> 42:37.915
Precisely.

42:52.760 --> 42:56.150
What kind of a man kills a cat
with his bare hands?

42:56.240 --> 42:57.912
In the carriage, Mr Roach.

42:58.440 --> 43:00.635
I did you all a favour.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.473
You'll not say it out loud, no,
but you know it.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.472
I did you a favour!

43:27.840 --> 43:28.909
She made the model by herself?

43:29.280 --> 43:30.315
She did that.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.390
If it wasn't for Lydia,
we never would have solved the murder.

43:36.840 --> 43:40.628
If you need a hand from time to time,
Bert, any help that we can offer.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.555
Thank you, Mrs Galbraith.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.914
So on the afternoon
that Roach killed Abrahams,

43:52.000 --> 43:53.911
Lydia was sitting on the porch,
plain as day.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.194
Roach must have seen her.

43:55.800 --> 43:56.994
Oh, I think he did.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.757
But, like everyone else
in this neighbourhood,

43:59.840 --> 44:01.273
he assumed she was oblivious.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.073
And yet she remembered everything.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.756
Do you think she was aware
she was recording a murder

44:06.840 --> 44:08.558
when she made that model?

44:08.640 --> 44:09.709
We'll never know.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.315
I suppose she lives
in a world of her own.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.238
Such a lonely place.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.593
Why do you say that?

44:18.600 --> 44:20.477
Because she can't communicate
her feelings.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.152
You believe that makes her unhappy?

44:25.240 --> 44:26.753
Well, it would make me unhappy.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.195
Hmm.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.358
I don't think
Lydia views her life the way we do.

44:33.200 --> 44:37.591
I think there's a solace and certainty
and order that sustains her.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.075
And that's enough?

44:41.800 --> 44:43.233
Sometimes it has to be.

44:44.305 --> 44:50.550
