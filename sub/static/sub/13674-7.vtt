— (Crowd cheering, shouting)

00:10.303 --> 00:12.168
- (Distant siren)
— (Whistle blows)

00:16.142 --> 00:17.757
(Man) What the fuck?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.639
(Davis) Me, me, me, me!
Hey, hey, hey!

00:21.772 --> 00:24.684
A shoe! A shoe! A shoe!

00:24.817 --> 00:26.808
— Yes! Yes!
— (Girl) Throw the shoe!

00:26.944 --> 00:28.900
— Yes! (Laughs)
— No! Hey!

00:29.030 --> 00:30.816
I... That was mine, man.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.939
— That was mine.
— (Annie laughs)

00:33.075 --> 00:36.238
Denied! The arm was denied.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.621
I'm sorry, honey.

00:39.123 --> 00:40.988
Oh my God. Look, look, look.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.162
— Look. It changes color.
- (Gasps)

00:44.295 --> 00:46.911
— I love Muses.
— I know.

00:47.048 --> 00:50.791
I must get a shoe! Yeah, right now!

00:50.927 --> 00:53.634
You see me? Right here, right here!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:53.763 --> 00:55.503
Oh, come on! You want to see it?

00:55.640 --> 00:56.800
You ready for this?

00:57.934 --> 01:00.471
— OK. How about that?
— (Man) Throw the shoe!

01:00.603 --> 01:02.309
(Davis) What?!
(Man) Come on, baby!

01:02.438 --> 01:04.975
—(Laughs)
— You objectify me...

01:05.107 --> 01:06.938
then you deny me?!

01:07.068 --> 01:10.435
Woman, thy name is cruelty!

01:10.571 --> 01:13.187
(Police radio chatter)

01:33.094 --> 01:36.052
(Man) Come on, baby,
throw me that shoe right there.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.136
Come on now, give me that shoe, baby.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.517
(J‘ Jazz)

01:43.396 --> 01:45.887
(Toni) Whoo—hoo—hoo—hoo!
Come on, Sof!

01:46.023 --> 01:50.107
If you wanna get a shoe this year,
you have to let 'em see you! Whoo!

01:50.236 --> 01:52.727
— Whoo!
— (Cheering continues)

01:52.863 --> 01:58.028
A shoe!
Hey, baby, you got a great one!

02:02.039 --> 02:04.997
— Wow!
— What do you say, Olivia?

02:05.126 --> 02:07.367
- Thank you.
— You're welcome.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.167
(VVhoops)

02:17.513 --> 02:19.094
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

02:19.223 --> 02:22.010
No,no,no,no.
Come down, come down.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.303
But it's Mardi Gras.

02:23.436 --> 02:28.396
Yes, it is, but if you want to do that,
you gotta get to the French Quarter, all right?

02:28.524 --> 02:31.266
Up here is for families.
This is the Muses Parade.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.438
Everybody on the float is female.

02:33.571 --> 02:37.610
So unless you go that way,
you're fishing with the wrong lure.

02:37.742 --> 02:40.358
Now try the boys of Endymion on Saturday.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.744
And take it to Canal, where nobody cares.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.914
Oh my muse, my lovely muse,
please, a shoe, a shoe!

02:55.051 --> 02:56.916
Right here! Right here! Yes!

02:57.053 --> 02:59.214
No, not a medallion, lwant a...

02:59.347 --> 03:02.760
I want a shoe! God!

03:04.518 --> 03:07.430
Goddamn it. How'd you get that?

03:07.563 --> 03:09.474
No. No, no, no, no.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.270
Fit for a goddess.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.770
Find another one in my size...

03:16.906 --> 03:19.067
and I'll wear 'em for you later.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.441
(Man) Oh, the big one! Hey!
(Man 2) Hey, hey!

03:22.578 --> 03:25.194
— Hello!
—(Laughs)

04:58.340 --> 05:01.173
- (J‘ Drumming)
— So far so good, my side of the tracks.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.169
- Good.
— Just the usual nonsense from here to Canal.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.045
I can send you a few bodies if you need 'em.

05:06.182 --> 05:08.969
(Officer) No, Tactical has this area flooded.

05:09.101 --> 05:13.390
Kid in the white tee,
this side of the yellow ladder.

05:14.315 --> 05:17.773
Gun down in his dip.
He just flashed his buddy.

05:17.902 --> 05:20.564
— White T—shirt, black denim?
- Yeah.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.483
Go easy on it.
I don't want him to buck.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.322
6—1 8 requesting backup.

05:28.746 --> 05:31.362
Nee—cey.
Yo, Nee—cey, wait up.

05:35.211 --> 05:37.076
On the move, crossing Saint Charles.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.249
(Man over radio) Copy on that.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.418
Can I borrow this for a moment?
I'll bring it right back.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.172
Hey, buddy. Buddy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:49.308 --> 05:51.640
Buddy, you leaving without a shoe?

05:52.895 --> 05:54.886
Just caught this. My third one.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.308
Hell, you want it?
For your girlfriend there.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.020
Damn, Marquis.
You can't even get me a damn shoe?

06:03.572 --> 06:05.358
Here you go, Marquis. All right?

06:06.075 --> 06:08.282
- Wait!
— Get on your fucking knees!

06:08.410 --> 06:11.152
— Get on your fucking knees!
- (Siren approaches)

06:13.999 --> 06:16.706
Now who the fuck brings a gun
to a parade?

06:16.835 --> 06:19.542
What kind of asshole does that?
I'm asking you.

06:19.672 --> 06:23.164
Who the fuck comes to a fucking parade
and brings a fucking gun?

06:23.300 --> 06:27.168
Why do you wanna take what's left of this city
and turn it to shit?

06:27.304 --> 06:29.169
Huh? Why the fuck do you wanna do that?

06:29.306 --> 06:32.548
— (Police radio chatter)
— Answer me, you stupid fuck!

06:32.685 --> 06:34.596
(Panting)

06:41.735 --> 06:43.566
Get him the fuck outta here.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.829
(Nee—cey) So I ain't gonna get the shoe?

06:59.962 --> 07:01.668
(Siren blares)

07:01.797 --> 07:04.163
(J‘ Violin being tuned)

07:07.094 --> 07:08.959
Is this the big one in Eunice?

07:09.096 --> 07:12.463
No, it's a new one
a lot of the musicians out there do.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.467
Wilson invited Harley,
and he invited us, if you wanna go.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.310
Cajun Mardi Gras? Not likely, darling.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.771
For one thing, it's on Mardi Gras.

07:20.899 --> 07:24.687
So how are we gonna
be in West French Toast, Louisiana,

07:24.820 --> 07:26.856
when we're gonna be
in New Orleans for the holiday?

07:26.989 --> 07:30.823
I'm saying we do something different this year,
go out to the country.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.612
Annie, my love,

07:32.745 --> 07:36.954
l have not missed a Mardi Gras
in New Orleans in my life.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.947
Harley says I should bring my violin.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.076
There's a fais do—do at the end
and everybody plays some.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.497
(J‘ Cajun riff)

07:43.631 --> 07:45.417
Hold on. Shh. Let me clarify.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.962
I'm going to leave New Orleans
on Fat Tuesday

07:49.094 --> 07:51.881
to wander through fields and swamps

07:52.014 --> 07:55.598
with some drunk—ass crazy Cajuns
I don't even know?

07:55.726 --> 07:57.341
This... This is the plan?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.218
Wha...

08:00.314 --> 08:01.724
Next year...

08:01.857 --> 08:03.597
(Whispers) ..it's all about you.

08:07.780 --> 08:10.066
(J‘ Plays violin)

08:10.199 --> 08:12.155
(J‘ Cacophonous horns, drums)

08:18.749 --> 08:21.411
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

08:21.543 --> 08:23.079
— (Cacophony stops)
- Yeah, Denard?

08:23.212 --> 08:26.454
Hey, we can march now.
We can get in some of those parades.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.548
(Kids) Yeah.
(Lecouer) Yeah? What would we play?

08:30.511 --> 08:33.173
— (Denard) Do Whatcha Wanna.
— All right, Do Whatcha Wanna.

08:33.305 --> 08:37.014
Let me see y'all shine.
One, two, a—one, two, three, four.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.882
(I All playing out of time)

08:41.522 --> 08:43.604
Oh, Lord have mercy.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.348
— (I All continue playing out of time)
- (Antoine groans)

08:47.695 --> 08:49.560
(Antoine) Oh! Uh—uh!

08:49.697 --> 08:51.437
— Uh—uh! Uh—uh, uh—uh.
— (Music stops)

08:51.573 --> 08:53.564
Do Whatcha Wanna?
Y'all don't know what y'all doing.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.908
(Chuckles) Y'all killing that song.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.995
It's gonna take a real band to cut that sucker
loose and send it to the Saint Louis Cemetery.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.159
(Boy) We should go for it.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.623
It's good we got our instruments
before Mardi Gras,

09:03.752 --> 09:06.744
but y'all can't just show up
and be in Zulu or in Endymion.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.590
People come to those parades expecting
to see the best school bands in the country.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.835
Y'all ready to represent that?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.586
(Kids) Yeah!

09:15.723 --> 09:18.180
(J‘ Trumpet plays Do Whatcha Wanna)

09:29.445 --> 09:32.687
(Boy) See? Robert could play it.
(Lecouer) I'll tell you what we should do.

09:32.823 --> 09:34.905
We should meet up somewhere
on Mardi Gras for Zulu,

09:35.033 --> 09:38.070
watch some bands together,
talk about what we see.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.615
— Who's up for that?
— (Kids) Yeah.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.364
(I All play discordantly)

09:47.463 --> 09:49.875
— That'll work for you, right?
- Hmm?

09:51.133 --> 09:52.464
For me?

09:54.219 --> 09:55.834
On Mardi Gras day?

09:55.971 --> 09:58.337
Pssh... Well...

09:59.516 --> 10:02.223
I wanted you to know I firmed it up
on those computer cables.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.059
I can still duck what you're currently paying
by more than half a buck,

10:05.189 --> 10:07.145
and there's enough left for us
to lay in a cut.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.266
I did what I could,
but Meffert's fine paying more,

10:10.402 --> 10:13.860
and he's the little king
of all the technology contracts.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.901
Huh. Well, if he's fine overpaying,

10:17.034 --> 10:20.367
I'm guessing it's one of his friends
got the current contract. His or the mayor's.

10:20.496 --> 10:23.738
Then we're gonna have to get you
some home cooking to go in there with.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.284
Home cooking? Huh?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.794
Have you ever heard of Zulu, Mr. Hidalgo?

10:27.920 --> 10:31.879
- Zulu?
— Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.624
You got me. What do they do?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.842
Home cooking.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.086
Old family recipes.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.963
Your son is going to spend Mardi Gras

10:41.099 --> 10:46.969
traipsing through the woods outside
of Bayou Grande Fromage, Louisiana.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.517
— Sounds lovely, Davis.
- What?

10:49.650 --> 10:53.313
You know, this right here —
this is the problem with relationships.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.902
Sartre was right.
"Hell is other people."

10:56.031 --> 10:58.522
Well, you and Annie should talk.

10:58.659 --> 11:02.447
Yeah. I don't know.
I... I don't wanna disappoint her.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.407
Oh my God.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.248
You're in love.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.961
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know...

11:12.089 --> 11:14.330
why I won't be at the party on Tuesday.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.206
Well, don't let that worry you.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.208
Your daddy won't be there either.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.210
He's riding Rex again.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.555
Dad hasn't done Rex in, what, six years?

11:23.684 --> 11:28.098
Try eight, but he and Ernie Roche ran into
one another in the bar at Dickie Brennan's

11:28.230 --> 11:30.266
and one thing led to another.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.559
Now they friends again?

11:31.692 --> 11:35.025
Close enough that Ernie asked
your daddy to ride his float this year.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.405
Even paid for his throws.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.574
This is a big thing for Dad. Huge.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.864
He would be heartbroken
if I'm not there to see him ride again.

11:49.001 --> 11:51.287
— Well, he'd understand.
— Shattered!

11:51.420 --> 11:52.705
Oh, God, what have I done?

11:52.838 --> 11:55.250
He'd be crushed! (Laughs)

11:57.467 --> 11:59.378
I'm gonna be there for my dad!

11:59.511 --> 12:01.126
(Bell rings)

12:01.263 --> 12:03.675
— (Chatter)
— (Man) Pounded tuna, one scallop, one fluke.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.798
(Phone ringing)

12:08.854 --> 12:11.061
— (Whooping over phone)
— Hold on a sec.

12:15.694 --> 12:16.900
— Yeah?
— (Woman) Guess where I am.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.360
You'll never guess.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.948
Well, from the sound of it, I'd say you're
somewhere on Canal and Endymion's rolling,

12:23.076 --> 12:26.034
— so I'm guessing you're drunk and stoned.
— Lucky guess! Whoo!

12:26.163 --> 12:27.903
(Woman yells excitedly)

12:28.040 --> 12:30.622
That's great, Julie.
Really, I'm thrilled for you, but...

12:30.751 --> 12:34.369
actually, it's calls like this
that make me homesick and sad.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.584
(Julie yells)

12:35.714 --> 12:37.579
But, hey, have a great carnival and...

12:37.716 --> 12:39.707
(Screams)

12:39.843 --> 12:43.836
And may you strangle on beads
and fall down in front of a Blaine Kern tractor.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.304
— OK, bye.
— (Man) All right, let's go.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.015
Two carpaccio, one octopus and a bass.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.968
New orders. Three octopus.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.268
— Garde manger, ordering four pounded tuna.
- Oui, chef, four pounded!

12:55.400 --> 12:58.608
(Man) I need two caviar pasta
with two concasse.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.353
(Man) You in the weeds, you need help?
(Man 2) I'm OK, chef.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.980
— (J‘ Tune ends)
— (Cheering)

13:03.116 --> 13:04.902
Yeah!

13:05.035 --> 13:06.525
Yeah, you're right.

13:06.662 --> 13:10.496
We're gonna take advantage of the bartender's
generosity and get a few comped drinks.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.239
Back in a few for the next set.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.162
(Chatter)

13:14.294 --> 13:17.206
The groove sounds a bit thin
without a guitar, pimp.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.921
Sounds OK to me, man.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.756
Besides, we could do better.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.251
You said so yourself.
He ain't no Freddie Green.

13:24.388 --> 13:26.424
- True dat.
— Hey, now.

13:27.557 --> 13:31.141
Say, brah, I think we should give Sonny
one last chance to fuck up.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.761
Man, you know his problem...
and so do |.

13:34.898 --> 13:39.141
And right now, if we gave him
a hundred chances, he'd fuck 'em all up.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.687
Right now, yeah.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.608
But, you see,
I kinda feel like I could talk to him.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.571
Cornell, why you even care?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.785
Man, I been there, you know?

13:53.417 --> 13:56.375
- All right.
— Thanks, man.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.090
— Where should I be?
- (Chuckles)

14:04.219 --> 14:06.710
That depends on what time, I suppose.

14:06.847 --> 14:11.557
Where might I run into you at around, say...
four o'clock in the afternoon?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.016
(Both chuckle)

14:14.312 --> 14:16.177
(J‘ Cajun music)

14:18.025 --> 14:19.606
OK, you can look.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.030
(Laughs) Voila.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.112
C'est tres chic, n'est—ce pas?

14:26.241 --> 14:28.778
Et ici le capuchon.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.821
It's pretty great!

14:30.954 --> 14:33.570
Yeah, you're really gonna go do this, huh?

14:33.707 --> 14:35.572
Mardi Gras sans la ville.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.324
Yeah, come on, you too.

14:37.461 --> 14:40.828
Harley helped me do the traditional costume.
Now I can help you.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.052
Annie, about that...

14:46.178 --> 14:49.011
Um, I've got a little problem.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.233
— | see you gave the help the week off.
- (Chuckles)

15:04.654 --> 15:08.397
Got a proposition for you —
a real simple one.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.775
You do everything I say you gotta do —

15:11.912 --> 15:14.779
go where I say, show up when I say —

15:14.915 --> 15:16.951
and when we get paid...

15:17.084 --> 15:19.450
l'll hold all your damn money.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.668
(Laughs)

15:21.797 --> 15:24.504
And for this | get what exactly?

15:24.633 --> 15:26.840
You're back playing with the band.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.172
Antoine sent you?

15:33.308 --> 15:36.471
Hell, no.
| asked him to give you one more shot.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.095
— I can hold my own money, man.
— No. No, brah.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.814
Everything I say, you do.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.561
This isn't gonna work
if you're hearing everything backwards.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.656
Gig tonight's at Prime Example.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.903
Be there at 9:30. Don't be late.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.710
(Man) Order in the bar.
OT in the house.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.170
Gralen.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.499
Here's the fella l was telling you about —

16:08.635 --> 16:11.377
Nelson Hidalgo from Dallas, Texas.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.629
So you wanna ride Zulu?

16:13.765 --> 16:16.723
I am told that I very much so wanna ride Zulu.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.262
(Men laugh)

16:18.395 --> 16:21.558
Ordinarily, you'd have wanted
to get started a whole lot sooner, man.

16:21.690 --> 16:25.103
Come down here, make the right donations,
meet the right people.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.319
But seeing as how OT is gonna sponsor you,
I'm sure we can work something out.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.905
You did bring your checkbook,
didn't you, baby?

16:33.869 --> 16:35.575
Why do I suddenly feel like a mark?

16:35.704 --> 16:37.365
Oh, no, it ain't that bad.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.658
No, I told him to bleed you,
but just a little bit.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.077
—(Laughs)
— Great. What you drinking, son?

16:42.210 --> 16:45.828
— Uh... Dewar's, rocks.
— A Scotch man. Big spender, huh?

16:45.964 --> 16:49.877
Baby, let me get a Dewar's rocks
and a drink for OT, please.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.752
And Zulu's where a guy like me
wants to be, huh?

16:52.888 --> 16:55.550
You want Nagin and his people
to take your shit serious,

16:55.682 --> 16:58.594
then these are the friends you need, brah.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.389
OK. Bleed me.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.603
— All right.
— Here you go, brah.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.768
— Hey.
— Welcome to the family.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.768
— Happy Mardi Gras.
— Happy Mardi Gras.

17:08.904 --> 17:12.237
No, see, I gotta see a man
about something at, like, four,

17:12.365 --> 17:16.404
but if you were to slide by the
Mother—in—Law Lounge about two on Tuesday,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.151
we could hook up then.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.824
You got a place we could go?

17:19.956 --> 17:22.117
I mean, it being Mardi Gras and all,

17:22.250 --> 17:24.081
where we gonna go from there?

17:25.503 --> 17:27.334
(J‘ Blast on trumpet)

17:27.464 --> 17:29.000
Let me work on that.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.376
(Cornell) The gang's all here.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.880
How y'all doing?

17:39.017 --> 17:41.599
All right, anybody make it to Bacchus tonight?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.719
(Crowd) Yeah!
(Antoine) Yeah.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.471
— Yeah, carnival is back, ain't she?
— (Crowd) Yeah!

17:46.608 --> 17:51.352
Yeah, speaking of which,
we have a real celebrity in the house.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.648
Would you welcome...

17:52.781 --> 17:56.694
Mr. Al "Carnival Time" Johnson
to the stage?

17:56.826 --> 17:59.363
- (Cheering)
— (Man) Give it up! Come on, give it up!

18:03.083 --> 18:05.074
— You remember the words?
- We'll see.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.916
— (Laughter)
- Yeah.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.205
(J‘ Drummer counts in)

18:08.338 --> 18:10.044
(J‘ Music starts)

18:13.426 --> 18:15.678
J‘ The green room is smoking

18:15.804 --> 18:18.591
J‘ And the plaza's burning down

18:18.723 --> 18:20.884
J‘ Throw my baby out the window

18:21.017 --> 18:22.973
J‘ And let the joint burn down

18:23.103 --> 18:28.439
J‘ Oh, because it's carnival time

18:29.693 --> 18:33.231
J‘ Oh, it's carnival time...

18:33.905 --> 18:34.985
(Crowd cheers)

18:35.115 --> 18:37.777
J‘ Oh, well, it's carnival time

18:37.909 --> 18:42.653
J‘ And everybody's having fun... J‘

18:48.336 --> 18:52.500
We begin with one of the best—loved
carnival krewes, Zulu, who in recent years...

18:52.632 --> 18:54.008
(Larry) All right, then.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.877
We'll be at the La Quinta by the airport tonight
and then back by dinner tomorrow.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.004
— OK.
— Sure you don't want to come, baby?

19:00.140 --> 19:02.927
Nah. Y'all have a good time.

19:03.059 --> 19:06.096
I'm gonna have my Mardi Gras right here.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.680
Aw. Bye, baby.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.651
Y'all try and get a couple of coconuts
for me and Grandmom, OK?

19:14.779 --> 19:16.986
— Uh—huh.
— You be good, jelly roll.

19:17.115 --> 19:20.027
— I will, Mama.
— See you, baby.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.993
(Man on TV) I think the important thing now
is that we're here for...

19:23.121 --> 19:26.409
After Katrina,
it shows a unity in the parishes,

19:26.541 --> 19:29.078
and it shows the world
that we can get together

19:29.210 --> 19:33.670
and have a wonderful, safe Mardi Gras day
and the tourists are welcome

19:33.798 --> 19:35.413
— to come back to the city.
- (Door closes)

19:36.760 --> 19:38.296
(Keyboard clacking)

19:38.428 --> 19:40.794
I thought you were working on your costume.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.015
You want help?

19:47.729 --> 19:50.766
I'm just...
not feeling it this year, Mom.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.890
You mind?

19:59.741 --> 20:02.904
Maybe we could just
do masks this year. Hmm?

20:04.245 --> 20:06.110
What are we gonna do?

20:06.247 --> 20:08.954
I thought we'd go see Pete
come out of Commander's.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.665
— He's back?
- Mm-hm.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.668
Daddy really missed that last year.

20:13.797 --> 20:16.504
I know.
We could work our way downtown,

20:16.633 --> 20:19.875
catch Saint Anne's, go to the river.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.967
The river?

20:22.097 --> 20:23.507
Well, yeah.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.801
lwas thinking, um...

20:26.976 --> 20:31.515
there's this tradition of scattering ashes
at the end of Saint Anne's.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.264
You want to scatter Daddy's ashes
in the river?

20:34.401 --> 20:38.394
Some of them. On Mardi Gras.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.895
Sure.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.948
The band plays Down By The Riverside and...

20:48.331 --> 20:50.868
they dip their streamers in the water,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.661
baptize the parade.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.203
I think he'd like that.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.708
Sure. I guess.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.505
I mean...

21:07.434 --> 21:09.390
you know what the river meant to him.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.067
— (J‘ Accompanies blues song on stereo)
— (Door opens)

21:22.240 --> 21:23.446
(Knocking)

21:25.535 --> 21:27.275
Pack a bag.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.118
Where am I going?

21:29.247 --> 21:31.488
Away, a couple or three days.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.036
— Where?
— (Chuckles)

21:34.169 --> 21:36.876
Brah, is there anyplace worse than up in here?

21:45.221 --> 21:46.882
(Woman) We're doing an anchovy vinaigrette.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.755
-Janeﬂe.
— Yes, chef?

21:48.892 --> 21:51.349
As someone who has
a strong connection to New Orleans,

21:51.478 --> 21:55.437
tomorrow Mardi Gras is for you, almost,
would you say, a religious occasion?

21:55.565 --> 21:58.728
That, and Saints home games, yeah.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.317
It would be bad karma
for the restaurant, I think,

22:01.446 --> 22:04.609
to have a believer stuck plating tuna
on one of her holy days.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.198
Oh, chef, really,
tomorrow is Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.488
Here it's Tuesday. It's no big deal.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.532
So make your own celebration.
I'm serious.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.451
OK. That's nice. Thank you.

22:15.793 --> 22:20.207
Hey, chef, would it be possible for me
to dine here tomorrow? At Le Bernardin?

22:20.340 --> 22:21.876
— On your holiday?
— Yeah.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.920
Of course.
So laissez les bon temp rouler.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.801
Thank you.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.718
— Laissez les bon temp rouler.
— Ooh, dinner for two.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.759
(Boat creaking)

22:37.482 --> 22:39.268
Where in fuck?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.607
— Pointe a la Hache, son.
- (Engine revving)

22:41.736 --> 22:43.397
Come on, man.

22:46.658 --> 22:50.571
What up, Unc? Good to see you.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.989
— This is my Uncle Don, man.
— Hey.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.579
— That your boy?
— It sure is.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.789
You ever done any oystering?

22:59.921 --> 23:01.957
No, none at all.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.877
You know your way around boats?

23:05.009 --> 23:07.796
Some. I'm from the Netherlands. Holland.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.471
— (Cornell chuckles)
- (Keys jingle)

23:12.600 --> 23:15.763
— Back on Wednesday.
— Wait, you're just leaving me down here?

23:15.895 --> 23:18.056
— What the fuck, Cornell?
— It's quiet down here.

23:18.189 --> 23:22.273
Relax. My uncle there is gonna
keep your ass out of trouble.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.235
— And where are you going?
- (Chuckles)

23:25.363 --> 23:26.899
I'm going back to New Orleans.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.989
It's Mardi Gras tomorrow night. (Chuckles)

23:34.956 --> 23:36.787

23:55.810 --> 23:57.266
All right, let's go.

Ooh! Wait.

(J‘ Professor Longhair: Go To The Mardi Gras)

24:07.989 --> 24:09.229
(Sighs)

24:18.458 --> 24:20.699
— Morning.
— What's up, Toby?

24:20.835 --> 24:23.622
Close the door, man.
Close the door.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.620
(Laughter)

24:31.971 --> 24:33.882
(Lively chatter)

24:37.769 --> 24:40.101
Remember now,
don't drink too many beers.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.220
You'll be going to the bathroom all day.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.478
Nah, that's too loose. Tie it tighter.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.740

25:45.795 --> 25:48.036
— Burn the levee!
— Burn it down!

25:49.340 --> 25:52.798
Got it, Del? Mm—hm, that's it.

25:52.927 --> 25:56.135
- Good, good.
— Yeah. You got that fiyo.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.505
You too damn pretty this year.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.800
So you want me to follow you
in the truck, right?

26:01.936 --> 26:03.472
Me, I don't care.

26:03.604 --> 26:07.017
Some other Indians —
I won't mention no names...

26:07.150 --> 26:10.563
Ronnie always gets a cramp
halfway down Saint Bernard

26:10.695 --> 26:12.936
and need to ride a few blocks, so...

26:13.072 --> 26:15.984
— (Delmond) You gonna come back here after?
— Where else am I gonna go?

26:16.117 --> 26:18.733
Big day, Chief. Long day.
Come tonight if you want.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.361
I got a couple of queen beds
in the hotel downtown.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.828
No, I'm all right.

26:25.543 --> 26:29.661
I'll put a room key in the glovebox, all right?
Just in case.

26:32.967 --> 26:35.003
Looking real pretty, Daddy.

26:35.136 --> 26:38.003
Yeah, you're right.
Take 'em down, Chief.

26:38.681 --> 26:39.841
(J‘ Percussion)

26:41.392 --> 26:44.725
OK, so make sure you get the Big Chief
the moment he steps out.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.845
Stay on Wild Man just long enough
to establish him,

26:46.981 --> 26:49.393
but come back quick
so we're sure we got the Chief.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.844
It's like an evolutionary imperative
not to eat stuff that comes in those colors.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.558
- Oh!
— We are gonna eat this, right?

28:07.687 --> 28:09.177
Not without being high, we're not.

28:09.313 --> 28:12.680
Chas, I assume you have something
rolled and twisted at hand?

28:12.817 --> 28:14.808
Indeed I do.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.276
But we're on our own here, sister.

28:17.405 --> 28:20.021
Nick's not getting high anymore.
He's found Jesus.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.648
— What, for real?
— Oh yeah, for real.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.618
- (Snickers)
— He worships at the church of Chang.

28:25.746 --> 28:28.078
What Chang? David Chang?

28:28.207 --> 28:31.074
Listen, it's a serious restaurant
that makes serious food.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.702
And it's time that I got serious
about making serious food.

28:34.839 --> 28:38.206
- Things have changed.
— When did you go to work for Chang?

28:38.342 --> 28:40.082
I got hired on last week.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.084
He stopped smoking weed yesterday.

28:42.221 --> 28:46.214
Ooh! Day before Mardi Gras?
That is an epic mistake.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.841
(lnhales deeply) I can no longer wait.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.514
Mmm!

28:56.819 --> 28:59.276
Yes. Yes.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.862
- (Janette laughs)
— I can see the light!

29:01.991 --> 29:04.653
Oh man! This is some sick business.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.696
I'm all, like, sticky and shit,

29:06.829 --> 29:08.740
but in a good way.

29:08.873 --> 29:12.491
- (Janette laughs)
— Revolting. Truly.

29:12.627 --> 29:16.211
Cloying to the point of retardation.

29:16.339 --> 29:20.799
Which one of you line dogs would like
to join me for dinner at Le Bernardin?

29:20.927 --> 29:23.088
— Really?
— Chef gave me the night off.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.211
lnvited me, said I could bring a guest.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.425
Fuck.

29:27.558 --> 29:28.593
I've gotta work.

29:28.726 --> 29:32.765
Then it looks like the honor will be all mine,
because today is my day off.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.762
— Awesome!
- Mmm!

29:35.983 --> 29:37.564
Not as awesome...

29:37.693 --> 29:39.524
— (Gasps, laughs)
— ..as breaking a tooth...

29:39.654 --> 29:42.987
— Baby!
— ..on some sort of plastic alien fetus.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.776
— But I'll take it.
- (Laughs)

29:44.909 --> 29:47.195
(Man) J‘ Ain't nobody gonna go mocking me

29:47.328 --> 29:49.193

J‘ Well, Big Chief comes

29:55.878 --> 29:57.789
J‘ Shoo, fly, don't bother me

J‘ If you wanna make news,

29:59.840 --> 30:02.252
J‘ Shoo, fly, don't bother me

30:02.385 --> 30:04.296
J‘ Hey, shoo, fly, don't bother me

30:04.428 --> 30:06.510
J‘ Shoo, fly, don't bother me

30:06.639 --> 30:08.880
J‘ Got a Wild in the front,
Chief in the back

30:09.016 --> 30:10.847
J‘ Shoo, fly, don't bother me

30:10.977 --> 30:13.309
J‘ We bring that dance just like that... J‘

30:13.437 --> 30:16.179

- (Man) Yeah!

30:17.692 --> 30:20.684
— (Man 2) Whoo! Yeah!
- (Cheering)

30:20.820 --> 30:24.654
— Daddy would have loved this!
- Yeah.

30:24.782 --> 30:27.239
At least he's here with us in spirit!

30:28.202 --> 30:29.487
More than, really.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.576
(Man whooping, cheering)

30:33.582 --> 30:36.449
- (Whistle tweetS)
_ (People chattering)

30:40.381 --> 30:42.838
— Councilman.
- (Laughs)

30:42.967 --> 30:45.128
Yeah, you right.

30:45.261 --> 30:48.003
If this is right,
I can't imagine what wrong is in this town.

30:48.139 --> 30:50.300
You got your throws? Coconuts?

30:50.433 --> 30:52.094
I should. I paid enough for 'em.

30:52.226 --> 30:54.558
That's what happens
when you come in at the last minute.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.678
Everything costs a little more, baby.

30:56.814 --> 30:58.725
— Where you at, baby?
- Hey, what's up?

30:58.858 --> 31:00.519
What's up?

31:00.651 --> 31:03.484
Is this the cat you've been telling me about?
The one with the computer cables?

31:03.612 --> 31:05.773
- Yeah.
— One and the same.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.521
We're gonna need to talk, then.

31:07.658 --> 31:11.446
But if you serious about getting your piece
past Meffert, you gonna need some help.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.786
Give me a call at the end of the week.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.700
— Happy Mardi Gras, baby.
- Happy Mardi Gras.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.074
Take care. Take care.

31:20.713 --> 31:23.455
Like I told you...home cooking.

- How you doing?
— How you doing, Harley?

31:43.027 --> 31:44.187
— Got your fiddle?
- Yeah.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.483
— Are you gonna play some today?
— l... I don't know.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.731
We'll see. Maybe.

31:49.867 --> 31:53.075
All right, Mardi Gras!
Vien voir ice, Mardi Gras!

31:53.204 --> 31:55.195
— (Cheering)
— (Speaking Cajun French)

31:58.042 --> 31:59.452
(Crowd singing)

31:59.585 --> 32:01.541
(Crowd cheering)

32:01.670 --> 32:02.955
Y'all ready?

32:03.839 --> 32:07.297
— T'es parea pour courir le Mardi Gras?
- (Cheering)

32:08.010 --> 32:10.501
(Man) Let's go over a couple of rules
real quick.

32:10.638 --> 32:14.881
Make sure when we go to the voisin's house
you get your butt off of that trailer.

32:15.017 --> 32:17.554
Bring your musical instruments with you.
You're gonna play for 'em.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.472
I wanna make sure that y'all beg.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.563
— Make sure you try to ask for some eggs.
- Let me see you beg!

32:22.691 --> 32:24.727
Or maybe if we're lucky,
they're gonna give us a chicken.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.442
If they give us that chicken, I wanna
make sure y'all chase after that chicken.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.404
— We're gonna catch him for the gumbo ce soir.
- (Crowd cheering)

32:31.867 --> 32:34.483
Number one rule of Mardi Gras is participation.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.987
We're gonna make sure you Yankees
don't fuck up our Mardi Gras!

32:38.124 --> 32:40.831
When I say Yankees,
I mean anybody north of Ville Platte!

32:40.960 --> 32:43.201
- (Crowd cheers)
— (Man) Ville Platte!

32:43.337 --> 32:45.828
- All right, all the virgins...
— We got some newbies in there?

32:45.965 --> 32:47.956
Oh yeah, look at all them fresh costumes.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.208
We'll make sure y'all get it nice and dirty.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.255
Get down! Get down!

32:52.388 --> 32:55.130
— Get down.
— Get down! I said, get down!

32:55.266 --> 32:57.177
Look at the ground!
Get your heads down!

32:57.309 --> 32:58.810
Get your heads down! All right.

32:58.936 --> 33:01.643
Hold on one goddamn second.
Stand up.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.888
— (Crowd) Ooh!
— What the hell is this?

33:04.024 --> 33:06.982
— Goddamn it! Look what we got!
- New Orleans beads.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.067
New Orleans Mardi Gras beads!

33:09.196 --> 33:11.061
We get beads around here, Toby,
what do we do?

33:11.198 --> 33:14.031
Know what we do with these beads?
MO is that way.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.900
Go to New Orleans!

33:16.036 --> 33:17.867
New Orleans beads at Mardi Gras!

33:17.997 --> 33:20.909
— What did you get me into?

33:21.709 --> 33:24.667
(Desiree) I like our old spot better.
(Antoine) Yeah, I know, baby.

33:24.795 --> 33:28.504
I told Lecoeur l was gonna meet up with him
and catch some bands with the kids.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.839
— (Larry) Antoine!
— Hey!

33:30.968 --> 33:32.924
— Happy Mardi Gras.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.044
Hey, hey. Happy Mardi Gras. Hey.

33:36.265 --> 33:39.507

33:39.643 --> 33:41.850
— That's our sister, right?
— Yeah, Honoree.

33:41.979 --> 33:44.436
You're Alcide, so that makes you Randall.

33:44.565 --> 33:46.601
— Dang, she cute.
- (Desiree) Yeah.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.226
LaDonna didn't come with y'all?

33:50.362 --> 33:51.977
- No.
— Damn.

33:52.114 --> 33:56.278
Yeah. Anyway, Antoine, look, I'm hoping
that they might spend Mardi Gras with y'all.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.867
I really think I need to be back
in Baton Rouge today.

33:59.914 --> 34:02.530
— That bad?
— (Whispers) Yeah.

34:02.666 --> 34:05.533
— No problem. I got this.
— Thanks, man.

34:06.629 --> 34:09.837
Uh... Just give me a minute, brah.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.173
— Say, baby.
- Yeah?

34:13.302 --> 34:16.920
Larry over there is saying that
he's gonna have to leave the boys with us.

34:17.056 --> 34:17.966
It's all good.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.931
So, you know, I'm thinking when you take
the baby home for her nap,

34:21.060 --> 34:24.769
they could go with y'all, 'cause I got plans.
You know what I'm saying?

34:24.897 --> 34:28.606
You think two teenage boys are gonna wanna
go to Jeff Parish to watch a little baby sleep?

34:28.734 --> 34:31.066
— Hey.
— On Mardi Gras?

34:31.946 --> 34:33.937
You know what time it is?

35:20.494 --> 35:22.359
Ma wasn't much on the idea, though.

35:22.496 --> 35:25.158
Nah, she wasn't gonna
be raising no musicians.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.781
— You catch my meaning?
— (Both laugh)

35:26.917 --> 35:31.377
Watch how they move.
Listen to how tight their drum line always is.

(David) It's what everything builds to,
really, Eric.

52:31.816 --> 52:35.229
(Eric) And I think this year's pageant
is more breathtaking than last.

52:35.361 --> 52:37.272
(David) Indeed.
(Eric) I'm beside myself.

52:37.405 --> 52:38.815
That's it — midnight.

(Colson) Gentlemen, New Orleans
just had a one-murder Mardi Gras,

and that happened after the parades
and nowhere near the festivities.

how that happened I have no fucking clue.

She's the daughter of a friend.

54:46.159 --> 54:48.241
She got drunk off her ass at Tip's.

54:48.369 --> 54:51.486
I tried to take her home,
but her old house was for sale.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.237
They must have moved.

54:53.374 --> 54:56.912
I only took her top off 'cause she threw up
in my car and passed out.

54:59.046 --> 55:00.786
And you tried calling your friend?

55:00.923 --> 55:03.585
I only have a law office number.

55:06.053 --> 55:07.793
You check her pockets?

55:07.930 --> 55:10.421
You think I was gonna put my hands
down herjeans?

55:40.922 --> 55:43.834
(Lyndsey laughs) It ain't that kind of movie.

55:45.593 --> 55:49.677

55:53.476 --> 55:55.717
- Oh my God.
— No, no, no room at the inn.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.718
— Who is that?
- (Door shuts)

55:57.855 --> 55:59.561
What's happening?
What's happening in there?

55:59.690 --> 56:01.646
My daddy and a new friend.

56:01.776 --> 56:03.562
(Laughing)

56:04.862 --> 56:07.239
(Laughs) Come on, let's go.

56:07.365 --> 56:09.026
(Laughs) Aw!

56:20.795 --> 56:22.535
She knows...

56:24.048 --> 56:25.458
about her father.

56:27.260 --> 56:28.921
Knows what?

56:29.595 --> 56:31.506
That he killed himself.

56:35.393 --> 56:37.054
She didn't know that?

56:38.813 --> 56:41.395
I told her it was an accident.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.601
Today I realized...

56:49.073 --> 56:51.234
(Sighs) ..she knows.

56:52.577 --> 56:54.818
Maybe she's always known.

56:54.954 --> 56:57.240
—Toni
-Mm?

56:59.625 --> 57:01.786
Kids...do stuff.

57:01.919 --> 57:03.375
I did stuff.

57:03.504 --> 57:05.460
Jeez.

57:05.590 --> 57:08.047
The shit I did... Do.

57:10.052 --> 57:12.338
She's a good kid.

57:12.471 --> 57:14.336
She's angry as hell.

57:15.391 --> 57:16.676
Yeah.

57:17.643 --> 57:19.224
She has every right to be.

57:21.731 --> 57:23.813
Angry at her father.

57:25.401 --> 57:26.891
Angry at me.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.526
- (Car door closes)
— (Don) You're late.

57:33.659 --> 57:35.775
(Cornell chuckles) And hungover too.

57:35.911 --> 57:38.698
Ash Wednesday — sounds about right.

57:38.831 --> 57:42.119
(Cornell) Yeah.
(Sonny) So you're going out too, huh?

57:42.251 --> 57:44.082
At least a couple of days a week.

57:44.211 --> 57:46.202
Every chance I get.

57:47.465 --> 57:49.296
Shit's got me clean.

57:49.425 --> 57:51.256
Keeps me clean too.

57:51.385 --> 57:52.921
Yeah, I get it.

57:53.054 --> 57:56.296
You're gonna talk some noble shit about
putting in a good hard day's work, huh?

57:56.432 --> 57:57.763
Hell, no.

57:57.892 --> 58:01.976
It's just there ain't no place out here
to party and get fucked up.

58:02.104 --> 58:04.971
- (Bell dings)
— You're right about that.

58:11.322 --> 58:13.563
How was your Mardi Gras?

58:13.699 --> 58:15.906
— (Laughing)
— (Engine starts)

58:22.708 --> 58:24.915
(Cornell) Get a chance to catch any beads?

58:25.044 --> 58:26.500
(Laughter continues)

58:34.887 --> 58:36.843
(Cornell) How about them doubloons?

58:36.972 --> 58:38.963
(Laughter continues)
