[epic music]

00:04.338 --> 00:06.374
*

00:06.407 --> 00:09.343
[dramatic music]

00:09.377 --> 00:11.112
*

00:11.145 --> 00:13.714
- I am Joel Davis.
My age is 37.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.649
I'm from Albert Lea,
Minnesota.

00:15.683 --> 00:20.321
The fact we're in this
1845 military base--

00:20.354 --> 00:21.689
this is badass.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.192
- I'm Chris Rowley,

00:24.225 --> 00:26.527
I'm 42 years old.
I'm from Rainier, Washington.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.262
I'm a little bit nervous about

00:28.296 --> 00:30.131
not knowing what
you're gonna have to do.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.600
But I enlisted in the army
when I was 34,

00:32.633 --> 00:35.136
and I deployed six times.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.837
So, I figure I'll be all right.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.839
- My name is Jeff Renner.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.542
I'm 49 years old.
I'm from Somerset, Kentucky.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.444
We're not in The Forge.
We're outside.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.579
But I'm not nervous
about anything.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.515
I don't think
that the judges

00:47.548 --> 00:49.750
can throw anything at me
that I can't handle.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.552
- My name is
Jeremiah Backhaus.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.655
I am 35 years old.

00:54.688 --> 00:58.692
We're walking in this moat
and I love history,

00:58.726 --> 01:01.762
so I'm excited.
But I'm wondering

01:01.795 --> 01:04.465
just what
they might have in store.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.767
- Bladesmiths,

01:06.800 --> 01:09.370
welcome to the great outdoors.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.139
Where you're standing
right now

01:11.172 --> 01:13.374
is Fort Tompkins' dry moat.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.143
This fort
is one of the oldest

01:15.176 --> 01:16.810
military installations
in the country

01:16.844 --> 01:19.480
and was used to protect
against overland attacks.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.449
Its combination
of shade and open air

01:21.482 --> 01:24.652
make this the perfect place
for you to forge a blade.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.254
Rest assured,
every aspect

01:26.287 --> 01:27.721
of your bladesmithing
capabilities

01:27.755 --> 01:29.557
will be put to the test today

01:29.590 --> 01:31.859
until we find our next
"Forged in Fire" champion

01:31.892 --> 01:33.794
who also leaves with that
check for 10 grand.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.896
Of course,
at the end of each round,

01:35.929 --> 01:38.499
you'll be presenting your work
to our panel of expert judges.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.467
Let's meet them now.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.402
Up first,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.671
two-time "Forged in Fire"
champion, Ben Abbott.

01:43.704 --> 01:47.608
Historic weapons recreation
specialist, David Baker.

01:47.641 --> 01:51.312
And last, edged-weapon
specialist Doug Marcaida.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.782
As we stand here in the
dry moat of Fort Tompkins,

01:54.815 --> 01:56.584
I think about castles,

01:56.617 --> 01:58.419
which makes me think
about hand-to-hand,

01:58.452 --> 02:00.454
sword-to-bloody-sword combat,

02:00.488 --> 02:02.256
and there were
a few civilizations on Earth

02:02.290 --> 02:03.557
that were really good at it.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.359
Today,
we're gonna pay homage

02:05.393 --> 02:07.495
to a very special breed,
the Vikings,

02:07.528 --> 02:09.330
by using these.

02:09.363 --> 02:12.500
[dramatic music]

02:12.533 --> 02:14.235
Coal forges.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.837
- You're in a moat
with coal forges

02:16.870 --> 02:19.473
that you have not used
in ten years.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.209
- You see,
the Vikings didn't have any

02:21.242 --> 02:22.943
moderns tools
or conveniences.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.179
So, today,
you'll be using these

02:25.213 --> 02:27.681
old-school hand cranked
coal-fed forges

02:27.715 --> 02:29.550
to make a blade.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.918
And not a signature blade
in your signature style.

02:30.951 --> 02:34.322
Today,
you're making Viking seaxes

02:34.355 --> 02:37.358
that are between 10
and 12 inches in length,

02:37.391 --> 02:39.227
not including the tang.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.794
- I've never made
a seax before, so...

02:40.828 --> 02:43.564
obviously it's like,
oh, crap, here I am on TV

02:43.597 --> 02:44.832
doing something
for the first time,

02:44.865 --> 02:47.501
but what are you gonna do?

02:47.535 --> 02:48.969
- Typically,
this is where I tell you

02:49.002 --> 02:50.538
what the tests are gonna be.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.306
Not today.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.774
Since we've given you
your blade design,

02:53.807 --> 02:55.543
there will be no design period.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.378
Make the best seax
that you can.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.480
Be prepared for anything.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.249
Now, let's talk steel.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.684
See, the Vikings
were plunderers.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.719
They kinda just picked up
stuff wherever they went

03:05.753 --> 03:08.822
and they made do,
so today you'll be improvising

03:08.856 --> 03:10.391
by harvesting the steel
that you need

03:10.424 --> 03:12.560
from our sword graveyard.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.628
You will have four hours
in this round.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.430
At the end of four hours,

03:16.464 --> 03:17.798
one of you will have
to surrender your blade

03:17.831 --> 03:19.433
and leave The Forge.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.634
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.736
Your four hours starts now.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.506
[rock music]

03:25.539 --> 03:26.774
All right, all right,
they're off to the races.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.442
- They're sprinting!

03:28.476 --> 03:30.244
- Hey, a big part
of this challenge is

03:30.278 --> 03:31.712
figuring out what steel
to use and how you can

03:31.745 --> 03:32.880
put it together.
- Oh yeah.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.515
Some of these actually have

03:34.548 --> 03:36.417
high carbon pommels
and crossguards.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.652
- I grab a hilt.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.454
Part of it's
wrapped in leather.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.290
I have no idea
what's underneath it.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.757
But there's so much
steel here, I figure

03:43.791 --> 03:46.294
surely I can make
something out of this.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.530
- I think the hardest part
of this challenge

03:49.563 --> 03:51.732
is gonna be making sure I
pick the right piece of steel.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.567
I want something
with a lot of mass

03:53.601 --> 03:55.536
so I can get
the length that I need.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.305
I see a sword sticking out.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.872
Then I see a shiny ball
on the pommel,

03:58.906 --> 04:00.774
so I pick that up
and get back

04:00.808 --> 04:02.343
to get that coal fire lit.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.312
*

04:04.345 --> 04:06.013
- The hardest part
about using a sword

04:06.046 --> 04:08.749
from the blade graveyard
is you definitely

04:08.782 --> 04:10.884
start at a disadvantage
of not being able to have

04:10.918 --> 04:14.622
a oversized piece that I can
do what I need to do with,

04:14.655 --> 04:17.291
and then, you know,
potentially get rid of excess.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.627
I chose some round bar
and high carbon steel.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.464
It's something that I work
with predominantly at home.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.699
When you have all these added
pressures of coal forge

04:25.733 --> 04:27.868
and making a specific blade,

04:27.901 --> 04:31.705
to me it makes the most sense
to try to get as many things

04:31.739 --> 04:35.543
that are as comfortable
for you that you can.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.378
*

04:37.411 --> 04:39.413
- After everyone else
hoofed it up there

04:39.447 --> 04:41.349
to get their material,

04:41.382 --> 04:44.318
I grabbed a broken sword blade

04:44.352 --> 04:46.554
that's gonna be
a difficult challenge

04:46.587 --> 04:48.389
because in my home forge,

04:48.422 --> 04:50.591
I let my machines
do the work for me.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.526
I don't know
what's gonna happen,

04:52.560 --> 04:54.995
but I'm going to give this
everything I have.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.597
It's DEFCON level ten.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.866
*

04:58.899 --> 05:00.634
- At this point,

05:00.668 --> 05:02.336
I'm trying
to flatten my bar out

05:02.370 --> 05:03.871
to where I can start
shaping it.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.773
- Chris--he's been a farrier
his entire life.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.475
Now, farriers--

05:07.508 --> 05:09.009
- They'll be
swinging monsters, man.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.378
- Yeah.
- Once they start moving metal,

05:10.411 --> 05:12.079
it moves.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.348
- The hardest part
about making a seax is

05:14.382 --> 05:16.584
I kinda really don't
know what it is.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.886
- The seax is just
a fantastic blade.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.054
Everything from fighting
to working, doesn't matter.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.524
It's all-around
a perfect knife.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.559
- With such a small fire pot,

05:25.593 --> 05:28.996
I have to work sections
of the material at a time.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.499
You know, I'm just thinking
I'm gonna heat it,

05:31.532 --> 05:33.567
and then I'm gonna beat it,
and then I'll repeat it.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.936
*

05:35.969 --> 05:37.638
- I'm used to coal forging.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.474
I coal forge outside
in the sun.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.510
This is exactly
what I do all the time.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.945
- Jeff has the biggest hammer

05:44.978 --> 05:48.449
I've ever seen
a smith bring here.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.783
- I brought this
8-pound sledgehammer

05:49.817 --> 05:51.719
just because I had a feeling

05:51.752 --> 05:53.053
that if we did
a coal challenge

05:53.086 --> 05:56.089
that I might need
something bigger.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.825
- You can work
in spurts with that,

05:57.858 --> 06:00.594
but eventually
it's gonna tire him out.

06:00.628 --> 06:01.729
- This hammer
is getting very heavy.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.930
Hah.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.533
Can't swing it much longer.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.935
- Whoo!
That smells good.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.970
So I have to make a seax.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.507
It's a weapon from history
that I'm really familiar with.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.975
So, I'm excited.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.911
This is what I wanted to do.
[laughs]

06:17.945 --> 06:21.849
- I believe Jeremiah has
the most experience with coal.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.052
- This is my world.
As far as I'm concerned,

06:25.085 --> 06:27.688
this is my race
to lose at this point.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.424
- Aww, he's got a big
ball bearing, look at that.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.926
- We know that that's
super high carbon,

06:32.960 --> 06:35.095
high chromium steel
that is gonna be

06:35.128 --> 06:37.998
incredibly hard to manipulate
on the hammer and anvil.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.032
- [bleep]

06:39.066 --> 06:41.134
*

06:41.168 --> 06:44.171
- The other smiths that
I'll be competing with

06:44.204 --> 06:46.507
I'm slightly outgunned.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.509
They're bigger guys.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.012
My thigh is smaller
than most of those guys' guns.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.682
I don't think
I can get this work piece

06:54.715 --> 06:56.149
wacked out with one hand.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.819
I had to involve
my entire body.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.855
- Joel is just going
John Henry on this thing.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.124
He looks like he's pounding
railroad spikes.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.158
Is this normal?

07:05.192 --> 07:07.461
- Uh, no.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.129
- That's an
interesting technique.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.631
I've never seen
that one before.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.800
- My arms are curling up

07:12.833 --> 07:14.902
like praying mantis arms.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.806
I'm feeling
a potpourri of emotions

07:18.839 --> 07:21.742
from, dude you ain't gonna
get this [bleep] done,

07:21.775 --> 07:26.079
to, you've got
to find it inside.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.648
Just do it!

07:27.681 --> 07:28.849
*

07:28.882 --> 07:30.250
I brought an apparatus

07:30.283 --> 07:32.520
called the Miller Cool Belt

07:32.553 --> 07:34.655
which is this sand apparatus

07:34.688 --> 07:37.925
and blasts air
down on your head.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.660
- Joel is putting on
a respirator.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.161
- Oh, he's got a respirator.
- Wow.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.197
- Yes, it's his space suit.
[laughter]

07:44.231 --> 07:46.099
- He's allowed three tools.
That counts as a tool.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.702
- Looks like one of those
race car units

07:48.736 --> 07:50.904
that puts the cold air
around your head.

07:50.938 --> 07:54.542
Hey, you know, if it works,
yay.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.711
- Bladesmiths, one hour
has already elapsed!

07:57.745 --> 08:00.848
You have just three hours
remaining to finish your work!

08:00.881 --> 08:03.016
- At this point,
I've got my tip formed.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.587
So, on all my knives,
I put a finger groove in it.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.221
- Chris seems to be our smith

08:08.255 --> 08:10.724
who's kinda
pulling ahead right now.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.527
He recently just
completed seven years

08:13.561 --> 08:14.795
with 2nd Ranger Battalion.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.296
Chris?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.965
We can't let you go on
unless you say

08:17.998 --> 08:19.933
3rd Battalion's
the best battalion.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.837
[laughter]

08:23.871 --> 08:26.173
- The only thing that's really
in my mind is the judges.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.008
They might look
at it and be like,

08:28.041 --> 08:29.977
I don't know what this is,
but it ain't a seax,

08:30.010 --> 08:31.211
so, you know, get out of here.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.846
So I'm concerned about this.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.782
[dramatic music]

08:38.118 --> 08:40.888
Seems like my entire
forge time has just been

08:40.921 --> 08:43.824
to hammer and measure
and hammer and measure.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.093
Not even a tint.
I guess I'm a little behind.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.695
This was W-2 steel.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.229
It's a little tougher than

08:49.262 --> 08:51.765
I had remembered it being.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.735
Oh, my arms are tired,
oh, my arms are tired.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.169
Time is getting short.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.572
I've got to start
working on my tang.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.141
I realize I probably should've
waited a little bit longer

09:01.174 --> 09:04.712
and got a little bit more
length on the blade.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.748
I am afraid I've started
it in the wrong spot.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.584
So now my only option is to
narrow the blade a little more.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.120
- The size of his tang
is very, very small.

09:13.153 --> 09:17.290
It would almost be better
for him to hammer a shoulder

09:17.324 --> 09:19.793
into the back of that just and
pretend it's a through tang.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.028
- I can get it there.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.664
I'm just trying to not panic.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.998
Not long enough yet.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.266
[rock music]

09:26.299 --> 09:27.901
- Two hours has elapsed!

09:27.935 --> 09:30.738
That is half
of your forging time.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.873
- Jeremiah is the one
that got me worried

09:32.906 --> 09:34.775
with that teeny little hammer.
He's the biggest guy out there.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.044
He's got the smallest hammer.
- It's just too much work.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.813
- So I'm working
the ball bearing and I've got

09:39.847 --> 09:42.382
a huge piece of metal.
That's what I wanted, but...

09:42.415 --> 09:44.685
I'm not happy
with my choice.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.253
- Ouch.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.021
- I look up at the clock,

09:48.055 --> 09:49.389
and I don't even
have a bar of steel yet.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.224
This is when I know
I'm in trouble.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.694
If I had a power hammer,
I'd be doing great!

09:53.727 --> 09:57.197
But it's just me,
and I'm starting to discover

09:57.230 --> 09:59.633
that this is not
really working out.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.268
[bleep]!

10:01.301 --> 10:03.303
- Jeremiah still has
a lot of work to do,

10:03.336 --> 10:06.940
and time is just
ebbing away from him.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.743
- I've invested half of this
four-hour competition

10:09.777 --> 10:12.112
into this ball bearing.
If I had to start over,

10:12.145 --> 10:19.119
I'm not sure
I can get it all done.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.220
- So, I'm working
the ball bearing.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.955
[bleep]

10:21.989 --> 10:24.858
And I know that
I've made a mistake.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.060
Where I could make it move,
it--it's not.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.796
- It's very hard
under the hammer.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.166
I've got
the decision process of,

10:33.200 --> 10:35.202
I can sit here and fight this,

10:35.235 --> 10:38.171
or I can get
a new piece of steel.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.941
Is that graveyard still there?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.776
I'm gonna abandon
the ball bearing.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.712
- Jeremiah. I got a piece.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.114
You want that?
You can have it.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.016
- Jeremiah abandoned
that ball bearing.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.218
- That was dumb.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.853
Time is not on my side.

10:52.886 --> 10:56.824
I need to move
this metal fast.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.959
[rock music]

10:58.992 --> 11:00.794
- I'm worried about Joel.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.896
He hasn't moved that steel
a whole lot.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.766
Somebody who is more
technologically reliant--

11:05.799 --> 11:07.735
do you feel like Joel
is at a disadvantage?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.002
- Well, yeah,
you can see already

11:09.036 --> 11:11.338
that his fire has
kind of died out.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.741
- So I'm having trouble
with the forge.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.144
Mind you, this is
the first time in ten years,

11:17.177 --> 11:19.947
at least,
that I've used just coal.

11:19.980 --> 11:24.317
- I just watched Joel
moving his clinker breaker

11:24.351 --> 11:26.019
in and out instead
of around and around.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.421
And you see how much
smaller his fire is

11:28.455 --> 11:30.190
than everyone else's.
- He just buried it.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.126
- So, you think
that Joel's air flow

11:33.160 --> 11:34.394
is compromised at this point?

11:34.427 --> 11:35.763
- I think so, yeah.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.330
- I think to myself,

11:37.364 --> 11:40.467
how in the hell
are you going to finish?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.469
- Now he's gonna have to build
a new fire from scratch.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.204
*

11:44.237 --> 11:46.006
- Bladesmiths!
You have

11:46.039 --> 11:48.408
60 rapidly deflating minutes

11:48.441 --> 11:50.811
to finish your work.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.114
- I have my blade formed
and I have my tang formed.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.483
Then it's on to heat-treating.
Concern is just

11:56.516 --> 11:58.819
getting an even heat
over the whole blade

11:58.852 --> 12:01.922
for that little fire pot
in order to quench it.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.390
Common sense would tell you
just, you know,

12:03.423 --> 12:05.525
build a bigger fire,
you know.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.361
But sometimes
I'm not real smart.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.265
[dramatic music]

12:12.299 --> 12:14.167
- Chris quenched
and now he's in a vise.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.235
- Yup.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.470
[tense music]

12:17.504 --> 12:20.273
- It's straight, it's just
a taste under 11 inches,

12:20.307 --> 12:21.942
so that's right in the middle
of the parameters.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.410
Now my concern is

12:23.443 --> 12:26.279
does it actually
look like a seax or not,

12:26.313 --> 12:30.017
'cause I'm still not 100% sure
what a seax is. [laugh]

12:30.050 --> 12:32.319
- Getting tired.
Getting tired.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.221
It's hard to hold the metal.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.524
- Yeah, see how choked up
Jeff is on that hammer?

12:37.557 --> 12:39.259
- He's exhausted.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.460
- Some of our smiths
who show up

12:40.493 --> 12:42.029
don't realize that it's also

12:42.062 --> 12:43.964
a physical competition.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.498
A lot of them just
aren't ready for that.

12:45.532 --> 12:49.136
- I would say 90% of them
aren't ready.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.038
- Got my length right.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.940
I'm wore out.
Time's running out.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.108
I've got to get
this blade heat-treated.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.910
*

12:56.944 --> 12:58.245
- Oh. There's a quench.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.479
- All right.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.548
Jeff is in the fire.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.217
*

13:04.251 --> 13:07.554
- Blade file tests but I'm
afraid that I'm not getting

13:07.587 --> 13:10.223
as an even heat on it
as I should have.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.192
I'm not crazy about it.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.562
And there could be a soft spot
or two in the blade.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.031
[dramatic music]

13:18.065 --> 13:20.834
- Can you see
Jeremiah's work over here?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.569
He very quickly took that down.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.537
- Once I changed my plan,

13:24.571 --> 13:27.007
uh, things started going
a lot better.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.609
The time to actually
quench this knife is upon me.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.045
I'm a little nervous
about it, but all in all,

13:32.079 --> 13:33.881
I'm actually feeling
pretty good about it.

13:33.914 --> 13:34.982
*

13:35.015 --> 13:36.449
- He's in the bucket.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.885
- Jeremiah's in the quench.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.187
[rock music]

13:40.220 --> 13:41.454
- It's straight.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.390
[metal scraping]

13:43.423 --> 13:45.092
And we are hard.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.060
I'm very happy.
I have a knife now.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.896
[tense music]

13:48.929 --> 13:51.264
- Joel, who's just trying
to come from behind,

13:51.298 --> 13:53.133
trying to make up time.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.968
- well, that blade doesn't
look 10 inches to me.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.237
- So, at this point,
I'm thinking to myself,

13:57.270 --> 14:00.640
I've go--I've gotta
get this thing into the oil.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.242
This is intense.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.012
- Ten, nine, eight,

14:05.045 --> 14:08.115
seven, six, five,

14:08.148 --> 14:10.183
four, three--

14:10.217 --> 14:12.152
- Damn!
- Two, one.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.287
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.356
This forging round is over.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.191
[clapping]

14:18.225 --> 14:20.327
- At this point,
I'm not satisfied.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.529
I wish I had more time
to get this done.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.397
I don't think
it's long enough.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.967
I don't know
if it's gonna pass or not.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.970
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to our Forge.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.939
Now that the first round
is over, it's time

14:31.972 --> 14:34.074
for the judges to take
a closer look at your work.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.642
Joel, you're up first.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.111
Please present your blade
to the judges.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.413
*

14:40.447 --> 14:42.282
- Well, Joel,
it's interesting to see

14:42.315 --> 14:44.217
when modern technology
is removed

14:44.251 --> 14:46.286
how you react to that.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.921
You had trouble
with your forge.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.023
But you didn't give up.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.258
You have a nice design here.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.193
It's pretty much straight.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.262
It should be
very interesting to test.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.230
*

14:57.264 --> 14:59.199
- Yeah, there are those
long, pointed seaxes,

14:59.232 --> 15:02.302
so it's neat seeing something
that's outside the realm

15:02.335 --> 15:04.271
of what everybody else
has done.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.606
If you move forward, it's
gonna be interesting to see

15:06.639 --> 15:08.641
what you do
to work out that tang.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.643
It's not a lot of support,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.712
regardless of how you put
a handle on here.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.447
- All right, Chris,

15:14.481 --> 15:16.016
please present your blade
to the judges.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.451
*

15:18.485 --> 15:20.153
- Well, Chris, it was
a pleasure to watch you work.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.622
I loved to see
that farrier swing.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.457
I mean, you really
moved metal quickly.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.559
Your seax
is beautifully straight,

15:26.593 --> 15:30.197
finger well's a little lean
with a hammer grip.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.565
But very well done.
- Thank you.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.267
- Jeff, you're up.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.269
Please present your work
to the judges.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.438
*

15:38.471 --> 15:40.974
- You've got a good,
straight piece of steel here.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.276
You got a nice profile set up.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.445
You did a great job
working it out there.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.514
Not an easy challenge.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.250
- The thing that gives me any
pause is this handle area.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.985
If this is intended
to be a full tang,

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
it's very short for my hand.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.189
You know, I'm gonna be falling
off the back of it

15:56.223 --> 15:59.126
without anything there
to hold me on.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.593
- Jeremiah, you're up.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.362
Please present your work
to the judges.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.364
*

16:04.397 --> 16:06.699
- Now, that's a seax.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.768
That's the kind of idea
that I had

16:08.801 --> 16:11.138
when I thought about the seax
that you could be making.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.441
This is your game and it shows.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.276
- The only thing that gives
me any concern about this

16:16.309 --> 16:18.145
is the position of your tang.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.779
If you do
a hidden tang construction,

16:19.812 --> 16:21.581
you need to have handle
material on both sides,

16:21.614 --> 16:23.250
which would stick the handle

16:23.283 --> 16:26.086
up off the edge
of the spine here.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.788
If you go forward, we'll
see where you go with that.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.124
- The judges are going into
deliberation to determine

16:31.158 --> 16:33.093
who has to leave The Forge.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.794
I'm gonna have you leave
your seaxes here on the table

16:34.827 --> 16:37.197
and step off the Forge floor.
Thank you.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.268
[tense music]

16:41.301 --> 16:43.036
*

16:43.070 --> 16:44.371
- Are y'all glad
that's over with?

16:44.404 --> 16:45.672
- Phew.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.507
- All right, judges.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.675
Let's take a closer look
at our contestants' work.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.043
We'll start with Jeremiah.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.445
*

16:52.479 --> 16:56.449
- This is by far the most
classic seax shape.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.485
I mean, it feels nice.
There's weight to it.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.387
The only thing I would've
liked to have seen

17:00.420 --> 17:02.689
is him draw this blade out.
He has the material here.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.325
It would've been nice to have
another half inch of blade.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.061
- The hardest thing with that
unknown materials--make sure

17:08.095 --> 17:09.496
you got enough mass...
- Yeah.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.398
- To stretch over that.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.366
That's why I made
the bonehead of grabbing

17:13.400 --> 17:15.602
[laughing]
that giant ball bearing.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.638
- So let's move on
to our next bladesmith, Jeff.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.708
*

17:21.741 --> 17:24.577
- Jeff has a solid shape
for a seax.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.313
I like that he was able
to get this through

17:26.346 --> 17:28.081
with those big hammers
that he was doing.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.550
My big concern
is this handle right here.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.352
This tang right here.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.520
It's short and stubby
for the blade.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.322
*

17:35.355 --> 17:37.124
- Let's move on
to our next bladesmith

17:37.157 --> 17:39.226
and that is Chris.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.828
*

17:41.861 --> 17:44.164
- Well, Chris turned in
a very finished blade here.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.133
It's got the
right profile to it,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.735
and it's got a full tang
handle coming along.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.770
I think it's a nice piece.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.673
- Yeah, he's given us a sorta
modern take on a seax

17:53.706 --> 17:55.308
by putting
this finger well in it.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.277
Not a huge fan of these,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.412
but if this one lines up
the way the way it swells,

17:59.446 --> 18:01.748
it sorta puts my fingers
where I want it to be.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.483
- All right, and...

18:03.516 --> 18:06.353
let's talk about our last
bladesmith, Joel.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.189
*

18:09.222 --> 18:10.823
- It's really rough.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.692
He ground in a little bit
of bevel to it,

18:12.725 --> 18:14.594
but the back isn't straight.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.763
Also has a very tiny tang.
I don't know what--

18:16.796 --> 18:18.331
he would have
to add something here

18:18.365 --> 18:20.300
to make this a useful tang.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.735
- I'd like measurement.
It looks short.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.173
Blade's supposed to be between
10 and 12 inches.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.875
Failure to meet even a single
one of our parameters

18:28.908 --> 18:32.645
is grounds for immediate
dismissal from The Forge.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.714
- Uhh...

18:34.747 --> 18:36.449
[dramatic music]

18:36.483 --> 18:38.151
- Bladesmiths,

18:38.185 --> 18:39.819
the judges
have evaluated your work,

18:39.852 --> 18:42.189
and they've made
their final decision.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.890
The bladesmith leaving
The Forge is...

18:43.923 --> 18:49.362
*

18:49.396 --> 18:52.699
Joel, your blade
did not make the cut.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.301
- Joel, I actually liked
where you were going

18:54.334 --> 18:55.602
with the design of your blade

18:55.635 --> 18:57.404
with that really
aggressive point.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.172
But it failed to meet
the length parameter

18:59.206 --> 19:01.474
by about a quarter inch.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.875
So that's why
we're letting you go.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.912
- Joel,
please surrender your blade.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.381
- I know I'm going home
this first round,

19:08.415 --> 19:10.450
but that's not gonna
slow me down.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.919
This experience
is speeding me up

19:12.952 --> 19:14.721
if anything.

19:14.754 --> 19:19.359
*

19:19.392 --> 19:20.893
- Congratulations,
you've made it

19:20.927 --> 19:22.962
to the second round
of this competition.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.697
Now that your blades
have been tempered,

19:24.731 --> 19:26.466
it's time to turn them
into fully functional

19:26.499 --> 19:28.568
Viking seaxes
by attaching handles to them

19:28.601 --> 19:31.271
using the range of materials
provided in our pantry.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.540
You will have three hours
in this round.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.842
When the time runs out,
we'll be testing your blades'

19:35.875 --> 19:38.345
strength and durability
and its sharpness

19:38.378 --> 19:40.880
in tests that we're still
not gonna disclose to you.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.549
*

19:42.582 --> 19:43.716
Good luck.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.885
Your three hours starts now.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.687
[rock music]

19:47.720 --> 19:51.391
- First, my plan
is to set up my handle.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.560
The judges have
told me there's a concern.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.728
So I wanna make sure that
I put something forward

19:55.762 --> 19:57.964
that looks well done
and put together.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.501
I grab some tulipwood
and some G10.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.670
[machine whirring]

20:03.703 --> 20:05.505
They're the right thicknesses

20:05.538 --> 20:08.275
for making a handle
that's substantial.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.976
[laughs]
That's not straight.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.512
Not knowing what
the tests are gonna be...

20:12.545 --> 20:14.281
this [indistinct] accuracy--

20:14.314 --> 20:15.915
right now,
it's all I have to go on.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.918
So I wanna stick
with natural materials.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.687
- Jeremiah,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.589
why do you like those
little hammers so much?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.557
- It's not the
size of the tool,

20:24.591 --> 20:25.758
it's how well you can use it.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.994
[laughter]

20:28.027 --> 20:30.963
- The grind of the blade
and the blade geometry

20:30.997 --> 20:35.668
plays a big part into what
you're doing with the knife.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.904
But I don't know what
the tests are gonna be.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.273
So that's gonna be
a challenge.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.542
So I just have to make
what I think

20:42.575 --> 20:43.976
will be the strongest blade.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.912
*

20:45.945 --> 20:48.448
- First thing I do
is weld a piece of steel

20:48.481 --> 20:51.351
onto the end of my tang
because it was a little short.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.019
- That's the perfect solution.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.654
- Mine doesn't look like this.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.389
It's way simpler.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.425
I'm struggling a bit
with the grinder.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.728
I'd never used one that
approaches this complexity.

21:01.761 --> 21:06.366
I've got to get my blade sharp,
and the clock is ticking.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.535
- If you're not familiar
with the tools you're using,

21:08.568 --> 21:10.069
experiment a little.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.438
Check out what
they can and can't do.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.672
- Bladesmiths!

21:12.705 --> 21:15.575
One hour has elapsed!

21:15.608 --> 21:17.877
- I'm not feeling as good
about the time in round two

21:17.910 --> 21:19.579
as I am in round one.

21:19.612 --> 21:23.015
I'm much more comfortable
on the forge.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.685
- I don't like seeing
grinders move that slow.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.987
You're not removing as much
metal as you could be.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.556
- [frustrated groan]

21:29.589 --> 21:31.458
Are you kidding me?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.426
It's not on the move.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.027
Time is ticking down,

21:35.061 --> 21:38.798
and I still have so much
I need to do.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.367
- We got two smiths
over here side by side

21:40.400 --> 21:42.469
unfamiliar with this grinder.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.504
- I wish we could just skip
this, give them the handles.

21:44.537 --> 21:45.738
I'd be better off.
- [laugh]

21:45.772 --> 21:47.574
- The metal is moving slower

21:47.607 --> 21:49.776
than I thought
it was gonna move.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.110
I'm really worried,
because I have

21:51.143 --> 21:52.979
a whole lot of material
to move.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.047
- Panic starts to set in.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.550
This is exactly what I was
afraid was gonna happen.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.420
And now the grinder
is not working.

22:00.453 --> 22:05.925
This is not looking good.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.694
- Panic starts to set in.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.429
If I can't grind this faster,

22:09.462 --> 22:11.598
I'm not gonna have
a sharp knife.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.667
You can tell that they're hard
and it's not wanting to move.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.570
- I don't like seeing
grinders move that slow.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.406
They've got
the grinders set at, like,

22:19.439 --> 22:21.408
a third the speed
that they could go.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.376
- And then out
of the corner of my eye,

22:23.410 --> 22:25.845
I see Jeff reach up and

22:25.878 --> 22:28.548
his machine sounds
a little bit different.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.417
- Jeremiah's actually--
- Oh, oh, they just caught it.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.652
- Oh ho ho!
- Oh, yeah.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.087
These have adjustable speeds.
I can speed this up.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.956
[clapping]
[laughter]

22:36.989 --> 22:38.525
Little difference.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.793
[rock music]

22:40.827 --> 22:42.429
- I tell you what, man.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.131
Jeff's blade
has a killing point on it

22:45.164 --> 22:47.767
if you wanted
to stab into something.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.603
- I'm not sure what my plan
is for my handle just yet.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.739
I told myself that I was not
gonna use a handle material

22:52.772 --> 22:55.575
that I was not familiar with.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.143
So, of course
I chose a handle material

22:57.176 --> 22:59.446
that I was not familiar with.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.713
It's very purdy.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.815
*

23:02.849 --> 23:05.184
I could not find a piece
of wood that I really liked,

23:05.217 --> 23:09.456
so I found a bluish-colored
resin or fiberglass.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.724
I will have to be very careful
with this material

23:11.758 --> 23:14.594
because I can tell already
that it's a bit brittle.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.430
- 30 minutes, bladesmiths!

23:17.464 --> 23:19.466
- Well, we've got 15 minutes
short of getting it

23:19.499 --> 23:22.001
where I really would like it.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.036
*

23:24.070 --> 23:26.639
- Now it's time
to assemble the handle.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.875
The handle material
that I choose--

23:28.908 --> 23:30.076
I think is ironwood.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.611
*

23:31.644 --> 23:33.446
I use hardwoods at home,

23:33.480 --> 23:35.448
and they look good
and they're tough.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.949
They don't call them
hardwood for nothing.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.552
*

23:39.586 --> 23:41.654
I don't really
stand around a whole lot

23:41.688 --> 23:43.823
waiting for my epoxy to dry.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.458
- Then you go to the grinder

23:45.492 --> 23:46.626
and it winds up
cooking the epoxy.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.960
- Yep.
- Hopefully

23:47.994 --> 23:49.896
that doesn't come back

23:49.929 --> 23:52.131
to bite me in the
testing phase, but...

23:52.164 --> 23:54.601
I'm not good
at standing around.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.036
- Jeremiah, Doug said
you better be able

23:57.069 --> 23:59.038
to shave your beard
with that knife.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.773
- Nothing shaves this.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.809
- [laughs]

24:02.842 --> 24:05.912
- Now I've got
my edge ground to a point

24:05.945 --> 24:08.948
where I can put
the handle together.

24:08.981 --> 24:12.218
It's back to my friend,
the grinder.

24:12.251 --> 24:17.023
I start to notice that a bit
of the ricasso is exposed.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.825
And that's just not a look

24:18.858 --> 24:21.494
that I want to present
to the judges.

24:21.528 --> 24:25.765
So I'm putting a little bit
of leather around the ricasso.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.500
- Well,
that's a pretty cool accent,

24:27.534 --> 24:30.202
to use a piece of hide to...

24:30.236 --> 24:32.872
basically hide...

24:32.905 --> 24:34.106
any gapping.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.576
- The handle is done.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.177
All I'm gonna focus on

24:38.210 --> 24:41.614
is making sure that
I have a sharp blade.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.816
- Five, four,

24:43.850 --> 24:46.786
three, two, one.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.755
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.290
This round is over.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.261
- I look over and
I'm impressed with what I see.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.096
At this point,
I think it's anybody's game.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.200
[tense music]
- All right, bladesmiths,

25:01.233 --> 25:04.136
I hope you've made the most
badass Viking seax

25:04.170 --> 25:06.138
that you possibly can,
because up next

25:06.172 --> 25:09.141
is the moment you've
all been working towards.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.977
The weapons tests.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.245
Up first is our strength test.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.114
Ben?

25:15.147 --> 25:19.018
- Bladesmiths,
this is the bone chop.

25:19.051 --> 25:22.321
- The bone chop.
I've seen it destroy blades.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.857
So, not terribly thrilled

25:24.891 --> 25:27.093
to see that's what
they're gonna be doing.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.995
- I'm gonna take your seaxes

25:29.028 --> 25:30.963
and chop into these bones
five times.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.298
Remember,
this test is all about

25:32.331 --> 25:34.033
what the bones do
to your seaxes

25:34.066 --> 25:36.603
and not what your seaxes
do to the bones.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.104
Chris, you're up first.
You ready?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.305
- Yeah, let's do it.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.574
*

25:41.608 --> 25:44.977
Well, my grind wasn't
designed to chop bone.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.880
I would've left a little
more meat on my edge for sure.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.817
[dramatic music]

25:50.850 --> 25:58.124
*

25:58.157 --> 25:59.792
- Well, Chris,

25:59.826 --> 26:01.661
there is some chipping
in this blade.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.196
The bones are known
to take their toll.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.366
The handle construction
is solid, but the finger well

26:07.399 --> 26:10.002
isn't all that extremely
comfortable as a hammer handle.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.038
But it held up well.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.205
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.607
- Jeff, you're up next.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.042
What are you thinking?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.944
- I don't think
I'm ready for it.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.012
I'm really worried.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.614
The bone test is probably
the most brutal test

26:21.648 --> 26:23.716
the judges have come up with.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.118
If that bone did that
much damage to Chris' knife,

26:26.152 --> 26:27.787
what is it gonna do to mine?

26:27.820 --> 26:30.356
*

26:30.389 --> 26:33.359
[rock music]

26:33.392 --> 26:40.032
*

26:40.066 --> 26:43.770
[tense music]

26:43.803 --> 26:45.705
Something hits the floor.

26:45.738 --> 26:46.806
[tongue clicks]

26:46.839 --> 26:48.007
- David?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.976
- My heart sinks.

26:50.009 --> 26:57.016
I'm sure that I'm done.

26:57.049 --> 27:03.022
*

27:03.055 --> 27:04.891
- Something hits the floor.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.760
It looks like
it's a piece of my handle.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.228
My heart sinks.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.163
[soft murmuring]

27:11.197 --> 27:12.832
[solemn music]

27:12.865 --> 27:14.400
- Well, Jeff,
there's no denying

27:14.433 --> 27:16.168
that your handle broke
right at the pin.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.804
Just was a weak spot.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.206
The chips in the blade
are substantial.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.074
The grain in there--

27:22.108 --> 27:23.309
it's not as tight
a grain as I'd like.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.844
It's a rough test.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.746
The bones
are nobody's friend.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.081
*

27:29.115 --> 27:31.951
- Jeff, your blade has suffered
a catastrophic weapons failure

27:31.984 --> 27:34.787
and it can no longer
continue to be tested.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.156
However, all's not lost.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.326
Jeremiah, your blade still
has to survive this test.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.294
- Put me in, coach.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.830
[tense music]

27:43.863 --> 27:45.932
My heart sinks for Jeff.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.868
But they still have
to test my blade.

27:48.901 --> 27:49.936
If you're not nervous,
you're not human.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.805
*

27:52.839 --> 27:55.808
[dramatic music]

27:55.842 --> 28:00.379
*

28:00.412 --> 28:02.715
[tense music]

28:02.749 --> 28:03.916
There's something.

28:03.950 --> 28:07.386
*

28:07.419 --> 28:09.956
- First things first.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.457
I love the handle.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.192
It's really comfortable
in my hand.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.327
The weighting
is perfect for a chopper.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.830
Everything is tight.
Straight.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.298
The edge held up perfectly.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.100
No chipping.
No deformation.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.235
Very well done.
- Thank you.

28:23.269 --> 28:27.406
- Jeff, your blade has suffered
a catastrophic weapons failure

28:27.439 --> 28:29.842
and has been deemed
unfit to continue.

28:29.876 --> 28:33.112
I have to therefore ask you
to please leave The Forge.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.014
[dramatic music]

28:35.047 --> 28:36.883
- I really didn't expect
to lose like this.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.751
I've just never had that
happen on a handle before.

28:38.785 --> 28:41.087
But even if my blade
hadn't failed,

28:41.120 --> 28:43.355
I would've been
perfectly happy

28:43.389 --> 28:45.424
coming in third
to either one of those guys.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.259
They're great smiths.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.361
They're gonna do
fantastic in the final.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.298
*

28:52.331 --> 28:54.200
- Chris, Jeremiah,
congratulations.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.202
You made it to the final round
of this competition

28:56.235 --> 28:58.805
which means that you're both
one stop closer to the title

28:58.838 --> 29:02.909
of "Forged in Fire" champion
and a check for $10,000.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.476
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

29:04.510 --> 29:07.780
to recreate an iconic
weapon from history.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.381
That weapon is...

29:09.415 --> 29:10.783
*

29:10.817 --> 29:12.518
A pair of Viking war axes.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.286
*

29:14.320 --> 29:16.488
During the Viking age,

29:16.522 --> 29:18.257
the Viking war axe evolved
from a common farming tool

29:18.290 --> 29:20.092
to a fearsome weapon of war.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.094
Its wooden shaft
and single-headed blade

29:22.128 --> 29:24.063
made it well-balanced
and light enough

29:24.096 --> 29:25.998
to repeatedly deliver
hefty swings

29:26.032 --> 29:27.834
with fierce cleaving power.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.836
The curved blade head
could be used

29:29.869 --> 29:31.904
to hook any part
of the opponent's body

29:31.938 --> 29:34.206
to forcibly draw them in
closer for a deadly attack.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.108
The razor sharp edge
could penetrate armor

29:36.142 --> 29:38.310
and bone
with frightening ease.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.147
Today, Viking war axes can
be seen wielded by characters

29:41.180 --> 29:43.249
in television shows
such as "Vikings."

29:43.282 --> 29:45.151
*

29:45.184 --> 29:48.020
Your final challenge
is to forge a matched set

29:48.054 --> 29:50.823
of Viking war axes.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.159
You will have five days at your
home forge to complete this.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.594
After five days, you will
return and present your weapons

29:55.627 --> 29:57.563
to our panel of expert judges.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.598
And only after they've gone
berserker with them

29:59.631 --> 30:01.367
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

30:01.400 --> 30:02.969
and hand you that check.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.270
Good luck, bladesmiths.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.439
We'll see you in five days.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.342
[rock music]

30:10.376 --> 30:11.844
*

30:11.878 --> 30:13.379
- It feels good to be home

30:13.412 --> 30:15.147
back out where
there's no people.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.917
I--I'm not
a big people person.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.187
Today, I'm making
two Viking axes.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.621
I've made some
tomahawks in the past

30:22.654 --> 30:24.390
and some axes in the past.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.125
I use a lot
of low-layered Damascus,

30:26.158 --> 30:28.995
so I'm gonna do
one 17-layer billet.

30:29.028 --> 30:34.100
Hopefully out of that, I can
get what I need for both axes.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.401
This is a bigger billet.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.103
Normally,
I start with a 13-layer.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.905
Lucky me.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.508
To get them both turned
and the eye formed,

30:42.541 --> 30:44.443
I'm just gonna cut
a little two-inch piece

30:44.476 --> 30:46.045
of inch and a half
round stock.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.947
Then I can start
turning the eye.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.082
*

30:50.116 --> 30:52.351
Jeremiah's been bladesmithing
for a few decades

30:52.384 --> 30:54.153
and I've been doing
it for a couple of years.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.422
So I'm kinda
the underdog so to speak.

30:56.455 --> 31:00.226
But I love the challenges
that come with that.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.628
I'll feel good when
it's done and it's right.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.431
Probably another three days
before I'll feel good.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.099
[laughs]

31:07.133 --> 31:11.337
*

31:11.370 --> 31:13.672
- I'm excited to get
working on these Viking axes.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.408
I'm taking the advantage
of having two forges

31:16.442 --> 31:20.512
so that hopefully I get
it done twice as fast.

31:20.546 --> 31:24.050
If I learned anything from
the first two challenges,

31:24.083 --> 31:26.318
is that I need to stand
on the shoulders of giants.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.687
I'm gonna stand on
the shoulders of history

31:28.720 --> 31:31.924
and I'm doing as close
to traditional as I can.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.126
So, what I'm gonna do now
is put this one

31:34.160 --> 31:37.329
into the gas forge,
switch the other one out,

31:37.363 --> 31:40.232
and get them both
to the same spot.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.602
My biggest concern
is that I get them identical.

31:43.635 --> 31:46.138
Being a blacksmith,
people want things

31:46.172 --> 31:48.374
that look exactly the same
all the time.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.109
So not to say that it's easy,

31:50.142 --> 31:52.078
but it's a challenge
that I'm prepared for.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.246
They're identical.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.516
- I'm pretty happy with what
I got done yesterday.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.318
Pretty much have
all the forging done.

31:59.351 --> 32:02.154
I can go on to the heat treat.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.990
My biggest concern--
just a nice, even heat

32:04.023 --> 32:05.457
all the way around.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.693
The heat treat is everything.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.528
A lot of things can go wrong--

32:09.561 --> 32:13.232
twistage, warpage,
breakage, bendage,

32:13.265 --> 32:15.367
age...whatever.
[laughs]

32:15.401 --> 32:17.369
If it's not heat-treated,

32:17.403 --> 32:19.605
then it's just
a pretty-looking wall hanger.

32:19.638 --> 32:22.574
[dramatic music]

32:22.608 --> 32:26.545
*

32:26.578 --> 32:28.280
Well, she's straight.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.481
Time to do it again.

32:29.515 --> 32:33.419
*

32:35.421 --> 32:38.090
Two for two so far.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.526
It feels good to have
the heat treat successful.

32:40.559 --> 32:41.994
I don't know
if you can tell or not,

32:42.028 --> 32:45.197
but I was pretty nervous,
you know?

32:45.231 --> 32:48.000
- I'm forge welding
a high carbon bit

32:48.034 --> 32:51.337
into the body of the axe,
making a durable edge

32:51.370 --> 32:52.704
which is historical.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.141
Um, I'm so nervous,
I'm shaking.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.543
Whenever you do a forge weld,

32:57.576 --> 33:00.046
there's always the chance
that something could go wrong.

33:00.079 --> 33:03.349
If the welds fail,
I won't have anything.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.485
[bleep]!

33:06.518 --> 33:09.088
They got way too thin
right up back here.

33:09.121 --> 33:12.324
The seams are showing.
The welds are not gonna hold.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.393
This is the worst thing
that I could've imagined.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.662
I need to start over.

33:16.695 --> 33:20.332
I'm thinking I might
have to make two

33:20.366 --> 33:22.701
in order to keep them
identical.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.136
There's not enough time.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.404
I may not finish.

33:25.437 --> 33:30.109
I'm in big trouble.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.211
[tense music]
- I need to start over.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.413
I-I'm in big trouble.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.648
There's no room for these
emotions right now.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.650
I have a job
that needs to get done.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.353
I don't quit
till the work is done.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.290
- Today's all about getting
the handles fit up.

33:44.323 --> 33:46.225
I'm doing a pressure fit.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.094
There's no epoxy.
There's no pins.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.129
It's a purely mechanical fit.

33:50.162 --> 33:53.099
It just slides on and a tap
locks it into place,

33:53.132 --> 33:55.167
and if the pressure fit's
not right,

33:55.201 --> 33:58.337
any good shock to it
could drop it down.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.806
[sigh]
[bleep]!

34:00.839 --> 34:04.743
One of my axes doesn't
match the other one.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.846
The bottom's wider than
the top and it needs to be

34:07.879 --> 34:10.682
tapered the other way,
so the only choice I have

34:10.716 --> 34:13.485
is to do it from the top down
and put a wedge in it.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.854
I guarantee that Jeremiah
is gonna do a pressure fit

34:15.887 --> 34:18.224
'cause that's what
it's supposed to be,

34:18.257 --> 34:20.792
so I didn't wanna be the guy
that took the easy way out

34:20.826 --> 34:22.861
and just put a wedge in it
and called it good.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.496
The most annoying thing is

34:24.530 --> 34:26.498
is that it's historically
not correct.

34:26.532 --> 34:30.102
Hopefully that's not
what bites me in the ass.

34:30.136 --> 34:34.640
- Yesterday I got my welds set.
I got my axes ready.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.109
Time to heat-treat
both of them.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.810
This needs to get done
the first time.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.380
If this doesn't work,
I'm in big trouble.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.316
[tense music]

34:44.350 --> 34:48.587
*

34:48.620 --> 34:50.222
It's--oh yeah.

34:50.256 --> 34:51.857
Still very straight.

34:51.890 --> 34:58.830
*

35:00.899 --> 35:02.868
I have two axes.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.404
Thank God. Amen.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.373
I need to get
my handles ready.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.341
I gotta go over the top.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.178
I gotta do something
that the judges haven't seen.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.445
[dramatic music]

35:13.479 --> 35:15.381
I feel good.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.317
[dramatic music]

35:18.350 --> 35:20.752
- Chris, Jeremiah.
Welcome back to The Forge.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.654
You've had five days
at your home forges

35:22.688 --> 35:24.423
to work on your
Viking war axes.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.524
Chris, how did it go for you?

35:25.557 --> 35:27.826
- Uh, not too bad.

35:27.859 --> 35:31.330
I made a low-layered Damascus
body and then I forge welded

35:31.363 --> 35:33.932
a 1095 bit in it
with a hickory handle.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.301
- Jeremiah, how'd it go?

35:35.334 --> 35:37.369
- It had its ups and downs.

35:37.403 --> 35:41.540
I went with a 5160 inlaid
in a mild steel body.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.176
I also took some time
and inlaid some copper

35:44.210 --> 35:45.911
into the blade itself.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.746
- All right, gentlemen,

35:47.779 --> 35:49.548
now it's time to find out
if they're worth $10,000

35:49.581 --> 35:50.816
in our weapons tests.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.584
Up first, the kill test.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.885
Doug?

35:53.919 --> 35:56.355
*

35:56.388 --> 35:58.290
- As you know,
I'm still nursing an injury.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.259
To be my arm today,

36:00.292 --> 36:01.893
I'm bringing a special guest
from Marcaida Kali.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.463
Please welcome
Staff sergeant Chris Manns.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.732
Today, he will be my arm--

36:06.765 --> 36:09.368
or, arms--to test .

36:09.401 --> 36:10.436
Chris, you're up first.
You ready?

36:10.469 --> 36:11.870
- Let's do it.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.539
I am fairly comfortable that,

36:13.572 --> 36:15.374
you know,
the axes are gonna test well.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.443
But seeing
the ballistics dummy,

36:17.476 --> 36:18.977
I'm just kinda bummed
that they don't have heads,

36:19.010 --> 36:20.979
'cause I was hoping
the head would be

36:21.012 --> 36:22.614
chopped off at some point.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.584
[dramatic music]

36:25.617 --> 36:28.720
- [grunting]

36:28.754 --> 36:35.761
*

36:36.328 --> 36:38.364
[tense music]

36:38.397 --> 36:39.998
[soft murmuring]

36:40.031 --> 36:41.500
- All right, Chris,
let's talking about

36:41.533 --> 36:42.901
your Viking war axes.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.504
On the initial cut,
the long beard

36:45.537 --> 36:48.374
that you have right there
hooked all the ribs.

36:48.407 --> 36:51.543
And of course, the beauty
of having a secondary weapon

36:51.577 --> 36:53.479
is that when he pulled it out,

36:53.512 --> 36:56.548
he had enough attacks
to disembowel everything.

36:56.582 --> 36:59.885
Overall, sir,
your Viking war axe

36:59.918 --> 37:00.919
will kill.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.388
- Thank you.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.022
- Jeremiah, shall we do this?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.325
- Yes, we shall.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.494
Chris' axes
were doing awesome.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.961
They're doing exactly
what they're supposed to do.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.331
So I'm a little nervous
that's setting the bar

37:12.364 --> 37:13.832
pretty doggone high.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.902
*

37:16.935 --> 37:19.905
- [grunting]

37:19.938 --> 37:26.645
*

37:26.678 --> 37:29.615
[tense music]

37:29.648 --> 37:31.850
*

37:31.883 --> 37:33.452
- All right, Jeremiah.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.355
Your Viking war axes
are razor sharp.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.457
It not only blew
through the ribs

37:38.490 --> 37:42.394
but dug in, breaking through
the lungs and into the heart.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.695
It is fast and light,

37:43.729 --> 37:45.631
and it will kill.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.599
- Thank you.

37:47.633 --> 37:48.834
- All right, bladesmiths,

37:48.867 --> 37:50.336
next up is the strength test.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.637
Dave?

37:51.670 --> 37:53.038
*

37:53.071 --> 37:54.706
- To test the strength

37:54.740 --> 37:56.475
and overall constructi
of your war axes,

37:56.508 --> 37:58.444
I'll be throwing them
three times with each axe

37:58.477 --> 38:00.879
into our mockup
of a drawbridge.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.981
Now, hopefully they'll
stay tight and right.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.416
Not loosen up.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.451
Chris, are you ready?

38:05.484 --> 38:06.918
- Yeah, let's do it.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.788
[dramatic music]

38:09.821 --> 38:16.795
*

38:26.672 --> 38:28.507
[tense music]

38:28.540 --> 38:30.075
- All right,
Chris, first off,

38:30.108 --> 38:31.910
they're balanced nicely
and they match

38:31.943 --> 38:33.545
which is really what
I was looking for.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.714
That stout edge though
kinda keeps them

38:35.747 --> 38:37.816
from penetrating
overly deep.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.785
And you can see,
right about here--

38:39.818 --> 38:42.588
there's just a small roll
in two spots.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.123
But they're solid.
They're still together.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.426
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.595
- Jeremiah, you ready?
- Didn't get dressed up

38:49.628 --> 38:51.730
for nothing.
- [chuckles]

38:51.763 --> 38:53.732
- One of Chris' axes has
a little bit of edge rolling.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.868
But I am still nervous
because if my inlay falls out,

38:56.902 --> 38:59.471
or I get a little bit
of edge damage,

38:59.505 --> 39:01.973
I'm worse off
than what Chris is.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.642
*

39:03.675 --> 39:06.645
[rock music]

39:06.678 --> 39:13.619
*

39:18.624 --> 39:20.626
- [laughs]

39:20.659 --> 39:22.694
[tense music]

39:22.728 --> 39:24.663
- So, first off, Jeremiah,

39:24.696 --> 39:25.931
they feel like
they weigh the same.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.533
They definitely throw the same.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.501
And having that curve
on the blade

39:29.535 --> 39:31.703
allows it to dig a lot deeper
than having a flat edge.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.472
But the bottom line is,

39:33.505 --> 39:35.774
neither of your blades
took any damage.

39:35.807 --> 39:36.808
Well done.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.510
- Thank you.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.011
- Next up,
the sharpness test.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.180
And for that,
I'll give you to Ben.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.050
- To test the sharpness of your
blades, see how they hold up,

39:45.083 --> 39:47.686
I'm gonna take your axes
and deliver three shots

39:47.719 --> 39:49.521
to these three fish.

39:49.555 --> 39:50.689
Chris, you're up first.
You ready?

39:50.722 --> 39:51.923
- Yeah, let's do it.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.092
[dramatic music]

39:54.125 --> 39:56.695
- Jeremiah didn't have
any edge damage,

39:56.728 --> 39:59.164
so I'm just hoping
they're nice, clean cuts

39:59.197 --> 40:00.999
or I'm going home.

40:01.032 --> 40:06.772
*

40:06.805 --> 40:11.610
*

40:11.643 --> 40:14.646
[rock music]

40:14.680 --> 40:21.620
*

40:22.020 --> 40:23.922
[tense music]

40:23.955 --> 40:25.891
- Well, Chris,
the gods of war will be happy.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.960
There's blood on your axe.
It's a good day.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.762
The shape of that blade--

40:30.796 --> 40:32.864
I was a little concerned
just 'cause it's flat.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.633
But it really just cut
right through those fish.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.635
Very, very sharp blades.
Well done.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.036
- Thank you, sir.

40:38.069 --> 40:38.970
- Jeremiah, you're up.
You ready?

40:39.004 --> 40:40.472
- Time for sushi.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.744
[rock music]

40:45.777 --> 40:52.718
*

40:53.151 --> 40:55.086
[thud]

40:55.120 --> 40:56.688
- [soft laugh]

40:56.722 --> 40:58.790
*

40:58.824 --> 41:00.592
- Well, Jeremiah,
same effect.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.027
Your axes are bloodied.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.696
They're now honorable
Viking war axes.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.532
They are beautiful.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.099
I like what you did
with the copper inlay.

41:08.133 --> 41:12.270
Not a huge fan in how thin
the handles are.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.140
To swing it took a little bit
more finger gripping.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.575
*

41:16.608 --> 41:18.510
Two very well-made axes.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.078
Obviously sharp.
Well done.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.279
- Thank you.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.548
[dramatic music]

41:22.581 --> 41:24.082
- Chris. Jeremiah.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.651
The judges have
examined your work

41:25.684 --> 41:27.085
and they've tested
your weapons.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.054
And they've made
their final decision.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.722
The "Forged in Fire"
champion is...

41:30.756 --> 41:34.993
*

41:35.026 --> 41:36.895
Jeremiah.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.730
Congratulations.

41:38.764 --> 41:41.667
Chris, your axes
did not make the cut.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.069
Doug Marcaida
will tell you why.

41:44.102 --> 41:47.272
- Chris, both weapons performed
equally all the way through.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.941
But in the strength test,
one of your axes

41:49.975 --> 41:52.243
took damage on its edge.

41:52.277 --> 41:53.912
That made us decide
that you're going home.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.014
- I understand.

41:56.047 --> 41:58.717
- Chris,
please surrender your war axes.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.819
*

42:00.852 --> 42:03.088
- You're always disappointed
if you don't win.

42:03.121 --> 42:05.957
But the experience that you
get from this competition--

42:05.991 --> 42:07.859
I've loved every minute of it.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.161
I'ma go back home
and keep making knives.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.997
And I'll probably make
a Viking axe on the side.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.966
*

42:15.000 --> 42:17.002
- Jeremiah, congratulations,

42:17.035 --> 42:19.070
you're our new
"Forged in Fire" champion,

42:19.104 --> 42:21.272
and that's a title that comes
with a check for 10 grand.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.308
How do you feel?
- That's amazing.

42:23.341 --> 42:24.910
- You did excellent work.

42:24.943 --> 42:27.178
Please present your axes
to the judges.

42:27.212 --> 42:29.815
- I did it.
I won "Forged in Fire"!

42:29.848 --> 42:33.351
To be validated as a smith
this way is really cool.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.120
This is a win for my family.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.788
Certainly a win
for the history books.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.590
Stay in school.

42:38.624 --> 42:40.659
Study your history.
It'll come in handy.

42:40.692 --> 42:46.164
*
