WEBVTT

00:52.343 --> 00:53.344
I like you.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.685
I have feelings for you.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.986
I'm one of those people
who plan every second of their lives

01:10.695 --> 01:13.114
according to a lifespan of 99 years.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.410
I don't like people crossing the line
or crossing it myself.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.662
And I'm fond of expensive shoes.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.832
I guess I'm your complete opposite.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.505
It's the same with
our blood types and personalities.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.132
I bet we're not compatible in any aspect.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.928
We're probably as different as
penguins that eat krill

01:35.011 --> 01:38.723
and polar bears that feed on sea lions.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.686
But to hell with all of that…

01:46.231 --> 01:48.066
because I like you.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.445
Ms. Dentist, I--

01:54.197 --> 01:55.532
Don't say anything.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.077
I'm not asking anything from you.

01:59.744 --> 02:03.706
I… My feelings for you
keep inflating my heart,

02:05.125 --> 02:07.335
and it could burst at any second.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.551
I can't help it anymore.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.804
I…

03:02.640 --> 03:04.017
I can't…

03:05.351 --> 03:06.811
deny it anymore either.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.028
I should go now.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.198
Wait. You can't just leave like this.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.951
I said and heard everything

04:03.701 --> 04:04.953
that I wanted.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.537
But I said like one sentence.

04:07.121 --> 04:12.168
I see. But that kiss
was more than enough--

04:12.252 --> 04:13.169
I like you.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.257
You told me
your feelings for me so honestly.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.176
I should give you a proper reply.

04:20.843 --> 04:21.844
I also have

04:23.429 --> 04:24.514
feelings for you.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.065
That's what happened.
No. I couldn't help it.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.739
Now that we've shared a kiss

04:42.615 --> 04:44.492
and confessed our love,

04:45.368 --> 04:47.328
-what's next?
-What do you think?

04:50.373 --> 04:51.332
It's this.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.001
Let's go.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.384
By the way, I'm the penguin,
and you're the polar bear, right?

05:01.467 --> 05:02.302
What?

05:03.094 --> 05:06.723
It's obvious,
judging by our personalities and builds.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.892
Sea lions? I bet you could feed
on humans too.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.061
Hey.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.691
That's it. I'm talking about that glare.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.234
You're so annoying.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.652
You got me.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.737
Come on.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.305
Your ankles must hurt.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.349
It's okay. The heels are pretty,
and that's all that matters.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.618
We're already home.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.120
You're right.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.207
Does this mean
we're officially in a relationship?

06:14.874 --> 06:18.294
Well… You can mark it
on your calendar if you want.

06:22.548 --> 06:26.803
Actually, wait. Can we hold off
being a couple for a few days?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.180
What? Why?

06:29.263 --> 06:33.184
Well, Seong-hyeon
told me that he liked me.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.898
Why do you have to tell me that now,

06:38.981 --> 06:41.275
when we're just starting to date?

06:41.359 --> 06:42.360
I'm sorry.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.071
I saw it coming,
though it was sooner than expected.

06:45.154 --> 06:47.073
-When did this happen?
-On Tuesday.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.992
On the day
of my grandpa's death anniversary?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.035
Hold on.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.289
It happened on the day
you helped me hold the memorial service?

06:55.373 --> 06:59.961
It's not like that.
He was waiting in front of my house--

07:00.044 --> 07:03.256
I don't want to hear it. Does it mean
you haven't given him an answer?

07:05.216 --> 07:09.137
Why not? Are you having second thoughts
now that you have to dump him?

07:09.220 --> 07:11.639
It's not like that.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.808
-Are you jealous?
-Jealous?

07:15.810 --> 07:16.853
That's absurd.

07:17.603 --> 07:21.441
I'm talking about
the basic etiquette you need to keep

07:21.524 --> 07:23.901
when someone confesses
their feelings to you.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.571
If someone serves the ball,
you have to hit it back, not dodge.

07:27.905 --> 07:31.325
To call it in or out,
you need to give him a straight answer.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.994
Then what about you?

07:33.661 --> 07:36.497
Why didn't you do anything
if you had known it all along?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.793
Perhaps, you didn't care
if he'd ask me out.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.129
Back then, I didn't know
I liked you this much.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.345
So, exactly how much do you like me?

07:54.390 --> 07:57.226
Well… Quite a bit.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.106
I'm sure you won't be disappointed
by the amount.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.610
Gosh, I was expecting
a lovey-dovey answer.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.404
-What kind of vague answer is that?
-Well, it's…

08:09.655 --> 08:12.241
as big as Lake Baikal.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.201
Lake what?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.040
-Lake Baikal.
-Lake Baikal.

08:19.123 --> 08:22.835
You may be smart,
but you seriously lack common knowledge.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.462
Do you want to get dumped already?

08:24.545 --> 08:27.798
Anyway, what will you do
about Seong-hyeon?

08:28.424 --> 08:31.010
I'm going to meet him tomorrow
and tell him.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.178
Just the two of you?

08:32.261 --> 08:33.513
It'd be weird if you came.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.265
Unbelievable.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.184
I like things in black and white.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.645
I want time to sort out

08:41.437 --> 08:45.691
the past I've shared with Seong-hyeon
and the time I'll be spending with you.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.238
So we're not in a relationship just yet.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.282
You're really something, aren't you?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.785
I won't call you
until it's all sorted out,

08:55.868 --> 08:57.745
so I hope you'll do the same.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.206
Don't. Don't you dare call me.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.916
Just go home. Go.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.921
Unbelievable.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.350
This is so annoying.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.117
What was it again?

09:37.451 --> 09:39.579
Lake Baikal?

09:41.330 --> 09:43.332
Lake Baikal.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.627
THE SIBERIAN SNOW COVERS LAKE BAIKAL

09:53.301 --> 09:55.386
This is how much he likes me?

10:04.353 --> 10:05.187
<i>Hello?</i>

10:06.314 --> 10:08.232
Didn't you tell me not to call you?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.485
You're the one who said that first.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.114
<i>I suddenly had something to ask you.</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:17.116
What is it?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.453
I looked up Lake Baikal.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.496
Hold on.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.419
"Lake Baikal is
the oldest lake in the world

10:28.502 --> 10:31.505
at 25 million years old.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.841
<i>With a depth of 1,743m,</i>

10:33.924 --> 10:36.093
it's also the deepest lake in the world."

10:37.845 --> 10:40.473
I didn't know you liked me this much.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.058
Just hang up.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.142
<i>Seriously?</i>

10:45.436 --> 10:46.312
No.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.737
Gosh.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.365
By the way,

10:58.366 --> 11:01.243
you should tidy up your room.
How could it be so messy?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.997
Well… Normally, I keep it clean.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.793
I just had to rush out today,
so I couldn't clean up.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.421
Enough with the excuses. Go to your desk.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.840
-My desk?
<i>-Yes.</i>

11:18.969 --> 11:21.847
<i>One minute. Okay, I'm here.</i>

11:21.931 --> 11:25.768
Do you remember
who took that family photo?

11:29.730 --> 11:33.943
No. But I do remember bawling that day.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.280
I expected too much from someone
who couldn't even remember

11:38.364 --> 11:40.157
if she had pulled out the plug or not.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.242
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

11:42.076 --> 11:43.786
Do you seriously not remember?

11:44.954 --> 11:48.457
There was this old man and a little boy.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.461
<i>I tried so hard
to make you smile that day.</i>

11:56.215 --> 11:58.926
<i>Are you saying the boy who danced</i>

11:59.802 --> 12:01.053
<i>was you?</i>

12:01.637 --> 12:03.097
Yes. It was me.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.266
No way. I can't believe this. Seriously?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.728
What a small world.

12:10.521 --> 12:14.233
Why are you so surprised?
You couldn't even remember me.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.528
I wonder if I'd be able
to find some boy as well.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.321
Boy?

12:19.405 --> 12:21.157
When I was in high school,

12:21.240 --> 12:24.660
<i>I ran away from home and
came to a convenience store in Gongjin.</i>

12:26.245 --> 12:29.623
And this boy paid for me.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.877
Don't tell me he gave you 100 won.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.423
<i>Was that you again?</i>

12:39.508 --> 12:41.635
Was that girl you?

12:44.054 --> 12:45.681
<i>Was it really you?</i>

12:47.391 --> 12:48.934
I'm getting goose bumps.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.564
Me too.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.609
It's like fate.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.904
No, just a coincidence.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.864
<i>Gongjin is a small region.</i>

13:03.199 --> 13:04.408
I'm hanging up.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.955
Eventually, we found
each other once again.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.975
EPISODE 11

13:32.394 --> 13:34.313
Let's add an insert here.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.981
I think we should emphasize it.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.902
Let's show this shot later.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.238
Probably better in reverse.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.698
HYE-JIN

13:44.782 --> 13:45.741
One second.

13:47.743 --> 13:48.994
Hello?

13:51.038 --> 13:52.831
I think a reverse shot will be better.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.209
We'll reveal the reason later
to make it more fun.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.878
It'll evoke the viewers' curiosity

13:57.962 --> 13:59.880
and offer a twist at the end.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.590
Let's cut it out.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.843
I'm really sorry,
but I need to head out for a bit.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.263
-Where are you going?
-I'll be back in the evening.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.765
Take a break. I'll wrap it up tonight.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.225
Really? Can we do that?

14:11.308 --> 14:12.893
Sure. Rest up.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.730
What? What has gotten
into that workaholic?

14:27.241 --> 14:29.952
-Here's some iced water.
-Thank you.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.704
You look hot. Isn't it hot today?

14:32.872 --> 14:37.376
Yes. I did rush over here,
but it is also hot today.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.295
Right. You rushed over.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.423
But you're not shooting
anything today, are you?

14:42.506 --> 14:45.718
No, I'm not. I just urgently needed
to come to meet someone.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.387
I see.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.180
All right.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.475
-Right, I should order.
-Sure.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.144
Two iced Americanos, please.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.986
If there's anything else
you want, feel free to order.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.323
Just say the word, and it's on the house.

15:07.406 --> 15:11.285
Thank you. I owe a lot to you guys.

15:11.368 --> 15:15.623
Gosh. Not at all.
But if you feel indebted to me,

15:15.706 --> 15:19.668
please remember my name
and recommend me to <i>Sugar People</i> and--

15:20.669 --> 15:22.379
Tell them singer Oh Yoon

15:22.463 --> 15:25.299
-would like to appear on the show.
-Sure.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.967
Hello.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.135
He already ordered.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.595
-Okay.
-Have a seat.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.764
My name is Oh Yoon.

15:31.847 --> 15:32.848
Oh Yoon.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.600
Hey.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.519
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.356
Don't say that.
I love spontaneous meet-ups.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.732
It's exciting.

15:42.691 --> 15:47.154
It feels like
I've just been handed my report card.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.115
Looking at it later
won't change my grades,

15:50.199 --> 15:53.953
but I'm still afraid to open it.

15:57.998 --> 15:58.916
I'm ready.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.544
I promise to accept whatever you tell me.

16:05.422 --> 16:08.884
Seeing you again
brought back old memories.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.682
To be frank,
I never really reminisced those days.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.310
I was feeling run-down back then.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.981
I had to make ends meet

16:23.065 --> 16:24.942
and also win a scholarship.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.319
You're right.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.698
I had no time to eat,

16:31.448 --> 16:34.535
so I always carried around
a few sausages in my pocket.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.956
I never slept more than five hours a day.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.376
I was barely keeping my head above water.

16:43.377 --> 16:49.091
And you were
the first person to care for me.

16:53.429 --> 16:57.141
<i>You were concerned about my well-being
and whether I had eaten or not.</i>

16:58.517 --> 16:59.727
Let's eat.

17:00.602 --> 17:01.603
Okay.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.441
<i>When you said, "Let's eat,"</i>

17:05.524 --> 17:07.651
<i>sometimes you meant it literally.</i>

17:10.904 --> 17:12.322
LET'S EAT

17:13.699 --> 17:15.951
<i>Sometimes, it meant "Let's play,"</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:17.745
<i>or "Well done."</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:20.456
Hello?

17:21.206 --> 17:22.416
<i>Let's eat.</i>

17:22.499 --> 17:24.793
<i>Sometimes, it meant, "Let's be happy."</i>

17:25.294 --> 17:26.378
Hye-jin!

17:28.005 --> 17:30.758
<i>Those words were like a spell to me.</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:36.388
<i>I had blamed myself</i>

17:37.306 --> 17:39.308
<i>for that foolish breakup.</i>

17:39.892 --> 17:40.976
Do you want to go eat?

17:41.060 --> 17:44.063
-Sure.
<i>-Your words</i>

17:45.814 --> 17:48.067
<i>comforted me greatly.</i>

17:51.904 --> 17:54.073
I had feelings for you too.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.871
I knew you had feelings for me too,

18:02.372 --> 18:04.333
but I feigned ignorance.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.629
I wasn't confident it'd work

18:10.339 --> 18:15.511
because I felt like
you had seen me at my lowest.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.268
I've always regretted

18:23.811 --> 18:26.355
not being true to my feelings back then.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.816
So

18:29.942 --> 18:32.653
I'd like to be honest this time around.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.533
I'm sorry, Seong-hyeon.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.327
There's someone I like.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.418
I'm relieved.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.967
You didn't hesitate

18:55.801 --> 18:58.011
like we did in the past.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.598
You mustered up
the courage to tell me honestly,

19:02.099 --> 19:03.100
so I'm relieved.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.981
But you see,

19:10.399 --> 19:12.109
that wasn't your lowest.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.905
You may have lived off sausages

19:17.489 --> 19:19.741
and worn ragged shoes,

19:20.951 --> 19:22.870
but you still radiated.

19:26.081 --> 19:31.128
You worked hard every day of your life

19:31.837 --> 19:36.216
and tried not to lose yourself
no matter what.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.052
And I loved you for that.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.935
I'm truly honored that someone like you…

19:51.231 --> 19:54.109
is my first love, Hye-jin.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.655
Likewise.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.796
Dad, the ice cubes are melting.
Shouldn't you serve them?

20:14.880 --> 20:15.797
Hurry up.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.928
No, it seems that I shouldn't.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.721
Are you crying?

20:25.140 --> 20:27.726
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.771
Hurry up and serve them.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.992
Seong-hyeon.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.287
Thank you for the charm.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.582
Would it make you feel

20:51.875 --> 20:53.961
uncomfortable if I told you
to just keep it?

20:59.216 --> 21:03.053
Well, I'm just glad it comforted you,
even for a moment.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.930
Thank you so much.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.851
And I'll be forever grateful.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.571
Why did he come here?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.036
Chief Hong.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.005
Chief Hong,
I need to have a word with you.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.549
Sure.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.638
What do I do?

21:47.180 --> 21:49.349
Are they going to fight over me?

21:51.601 --> 21:52.978
What if it gets serious?

21:55.355 --> 21:56.440
Gosh.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.739
I felt that the legs
weren't strong enough.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.742
That's exactly right. Safety comes first.

22:11.788 --> 22:14.708
Hye-jin turned me down.
She says she likes someone else.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.463
I think there's a problem with the wood.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.465
Maybe it's rotten.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.176
We should replace them.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.263
She didn't tell me who it was,

22:28.347 --> 22:30.307
but I bet he doesn't deserve her.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.605
Why do you think so?

22:36.688 --> 22:39.024
Isn't it obvious?
And my hunch tells me so.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.777
You shouldn't judge people
based on a hunch.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.737
I didn't take you for that type.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.572
That's very rash of you.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.659
Be good to her.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.622
Make her laugh a lot

22:54.539 --> 22:56.750
and treat her to good food.

22:58.794 --> 23:03.006
I'm a simple guy.
I don't like complicated things.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.468
I don't like weighing things
when it comes to people.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.761
It gives me a headache.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.679
I like her.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.183
But I think

23:14.351 --> 23:15.936
I'm pretty fond of you too.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.444
I hated studying
trigonometric functions back in school.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.822
Love triangles just aren't for me.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.454
I don't hate you either.
You just require a lot of care.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.872
You're not too bad.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.874
I hammered it wrong because of you.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.877
See? You do require a great deal of care.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.422
I told you to just watch,
but you insisted on helping.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.882
What about the leg you broke?

23:45.966 --> 23:49.845
Didn't you hear me earlier?
I told you the wood was rotten.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.307
Forget it.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.978
Just teach me how to surf again
when you're free.

24:00.981 --> 24:04.234
Sure. Let me know when you'll be free,

24:04.317 --> 24:05.652
so I can make other plans.

24:06.862 --> 24:10.240
Gosh, you're such a pain
in the neck. Darn you.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.910
I think we can still use this.
I thought the wood was rotten,

24:13.994 --> 24:15.579
but I can fix it.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.664
What? Stop smiling. You'll grow on me.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.666
This is how I normally look.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.127
I don't get why people say that.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.336
Hurry up.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.422
Are you going to help me or not?

24:37.767 --> 24:41.271
Right. Could it be
because I never did the laundry?

24:41.354 --> 24:42.814
That can't be.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.318
I was in charge of cleaning the bathroom
and mowing the lawn.

24:46.401 --> 24:50.405
Right. Could it be
because I snore too much?

24:50.488 --> 24:53.992
That can't be.
She snores even more when she's tired.

24:55.952 --> 25:00.582
What could be the reason for our divorce?

25:02.083 --> 25:04.878
-What are you doing?
-Gosh, you startled me.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.714
Why are you here on a Sunday?

25:07.797 --> 25:09.966
I'm here for the garbage bags.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.094
Ms. Yeo was too busy
to pick them up herself,

25:13.178 --> 25:14.763
so I came by instead.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.057
How could a zone chief

25:17.140 --> 25:19.809
be so irresponsible?

25:19.893 --> 25:23.063
She could stop by on Monday,
but since I'll be eating there--

25:23.146 --> 25:26.107
Hey! A civil servant
doesn't work on the weekends.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.192
Don't you know that?

25:27.275 --> 25:29.402
Just go home. I'll give them to her.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.405
But I'm going to eat
at her restaurant anyway.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.324
Eat somewhere else.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.326
-Fine.
-Darn it.

25:36.409 --> 25:40.872
What a pain. How dare she make me run
errands for her? I'm the village chief.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.375
-Then let me--
-Damn it.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.921
What's the matter with him?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.925
I haven't seen you in ages.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.428
Come by more often.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.888
All right.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.642
By the way, how old are you again?

26:01.226 --> 26:02.394
-Me?
-Yes.

26:02.477 --> 26:05.730
I'm past 40. Why do you ask?

26:05.814 --> 26:07.816
My husband's close friend

26:07.899 --> 26:09.192
is a widower.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.278
He's 44 with no kids

26:12.195 --> 26:13.446
and a judicial scrivener.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.241
He has a huge office
in front of Chung-ho City Hall.

26:16.324 --> 26:20.620
He sounds amazing,
but I doubt he'd date me.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.455
You are exactly

26:23.540 --> 26:24.874
his ideal type.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.503
He likes petite, cute women
who are self-sufficient.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.923
He loves children too,
so your son will be just fine.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.676
Oh, my. That's exactly me.

26:34.759 --> 26:37.429
What do you say?
Are you free this weekend?

26:37.512 --> 26:38.471
What?

26:38.972 --> 26:40.140
What was that?

26:41.224 --> 26:43.351
Mr. Chang, what brings you here?

26:43.435 --> 26:45.687
I have some business to do with her.

26:45.770 --> 26:46.604
I see.

26:47.272 --> 26:52.068
Ms. Yeo, you should fulfill
your role as the zone chief.

26:52.152 --> 26:56.323
Must I come all the way here to hand you
these garbage bags on a Sunday?

26:56.406 --> 26:58.116
I never asked you to.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.118
I said I'd stop by on Monday.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.162
You should've stopped by last Friday.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.997
I heard you were busy,

27:04.080 --> 27:06.124
but you're just having a casual chat.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.043
You might as well just step down.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.795
Sure. My term will be ending soon anyway.

27:16.551 --> 27:17.552
Goodness.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.179
Please distribute them tomorrow.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.430
Don't you worry.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.728
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.902
So…

27:35.070 --> 27:38.114
What do you say?
Do you want me to set a date?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.533
I'll keep it a secret from Mr. Chang.

27:40.617 --> 27:44.079
You don't need to.
I was just kidding earlier.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.082
I'm not interested
in getting married again.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.667
I'm content living with I-jun like this.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.587
What a shame. He's a great guy.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.089
I appreciate it, though.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.260
Was everything okay?

27:59.344 --> 28:01.096
What did he say? Did he talk about me?

28:01.179 --> 28:03.473
What did he say? Tell me.

28:03.556 --> 28:06.601
You should apply for a rap contest.
You've got talent.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.478
-What did you guys talk about?
-Go on.

28:08.561 --> 28:09.979
Come on. Tell me.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.109
He said he liked me.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.151
What?

28:15.777 --> 28:17.278
He favors me over you.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.030
Don't lie.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.077
I should've taken
a photo of your face just now.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.664
You show a variety of expressions.
It's quite entertaining.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.457
Stop joking around and tell me.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.669
He wants me to treat you well.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.796
He already knew everything.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.756
You have a great friend.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.634
Yes, I do.

28:39.717 --> 28:42.554
How boring of you to agree off the bat.

28:42.637 --> 28:43.888
It's all sorted now, right?

28:43.972 --> 28:45.849
No. Not yet.

28:45.932 --> 28:49.144
Why… What's left?

28:49.227 --> 28:53.815
Let's keep our relationship
a secret for now.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.942
Impossible. They'll find out right away.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.527
That can't happen.

28:57.610 --> 29:00.405
Think of all the drama
they started when we weren't dating.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.823
Imagine they find out.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.909
They'll start all kinds of rumors.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.204
Like, "They'll get married soon.
She must be pregnant."

29:08.288 --> 29:10.665
Gosh, I think you're the one

29:10.749 --> 29:13.001
making a fuss here.
You and your imagination.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.420
-That was just an example.
-Sure.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.381
In any case,
keep it a secret at all costs.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.718
I'm hungry. Should we have some <i>jeon</i>
since it'll rain today?

29:22.427 --> 29:24.429
-I'm serious.
-Me too.

29:24.512 --> 29:28.183
I know that they'll find out
no matter how hard we try.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.976
I should become a rapper myself.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.979
Just try. Stop joking around.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.898
I will, but it won't work.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.822
Fine. I'll do whatever you want.

29:43.782 --> 29:44.616
Happy?

29:45.492 --> 29:46.493
Yes.

29:48.828 --> 29:53.458
Then today's our first day
as a couple, right?

29:56.127 --> 29:58.463
Well, I guess so.

30:00.423 --> 30:05.220
Anyway, does making it official
make a big difference?

30:07.013 --> 30:08.473
Of course, it does.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.309
How so?

30:13.228 --> 30:14.646
We can do this…

30:16.940 --> 30:18.066
and this.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.362
And we can even do this.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.197
-Ms. Dentist.
-Yes?

30:24.864 --> 30:27.283
Were you always
so physically affectionate?

30:28.284 --> 30:31.329
Let me recommend a book to you.

30:31.412 --> 30:34.749
It's Georges Bataille's <i>Erotism</i>.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.001
-Georges…
-Bataille.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.128
-Bataille's…
-<i>Erotism</i>.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.797
-<i>Erotism</i>?
-Yes.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.507
What's it about?

30:44.509 --> 30:45.552
Stuff like this.

30:47.971 --> 30:48.972
This is nice.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.682
It is.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.019
My gosh.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.022
This is very annoying.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.525
Lock the front door from now on.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.485
Mi-seon.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.112
Embarrassed much?

31:04.195 --> 31:05.446
Thanks for the advice.

31:06.155 --> 31:07.907
We'll be more careful.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.617
Mi-seon, I love you.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.370
She's gone.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.581
Did we lock the door?

31:14.664 --> 31:17.208
-Let's be more careful.
-Okay.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.002
Georges Bataille.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.379
<i>Erotism</i>? Is it raunchy?

31:21.963 --> 31:22.797
Sort of.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.345
<i>The call is unavailable right now--</i>

31:31.014 --> 31:32.932
You said you'd come back tonight.

32:05.882 --> 32:06.758
What?

32:07.592 --> 32:08.968
Gosh.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.596
-Goodness. Hello, Director Ji.
-Hello, Mr. Chang.

32:11.679 --> 32:12.972
What brings you here?

32:13.056 --> 32:15.141
That's what I should ask you.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.977
What are you doing here?
You're not filming today.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.064
Well, it's a long story.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.816
If you're alone,
would you like to join me?

32:24.734 --> 32:26.527
Is that okay?

32:26.611 --> 32:28.196
Of course.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.447
To tell the truth,

32:29.530 --> 32:32.617
I was frustrated today,
so I came for a drink alone.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.494
-Join me then.
-Thanks.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.163
Goodness, that looks delicious.

32:38.581 --> 32:41.209
-One more glass, please.
-Sure.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.293
Cheers.

32:50.009 --> 32:53.596
This is what I really like about drinking.

32:53.680 --> 32:58.142
I like how you can feel
the alcohol going down.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.520
It goes down so smoothly.

33:00.603 --> 33:04.899
I agree. It's refreshing
and stress-relieving.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.734
It cleanses you.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.779
You must be quite stressed.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.490
I can empathize with you.

33:13.032 --> 33:15.284
We're both leaders.

33:15.368 --> 33:19.497
I think we share similar difficulties.
Don't you agree?

33:19.580 --> 33:23.084
For example, work-related problems
and responsibilities.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.504
You're right. Work is tough.

33:26.587 --> 33:29.424
But what's even harder is people.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.095
Relationships can be very difficult.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.973
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

33:37.056 --> 33:40.184
I don't know why
relationships are so complicated.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.020
Things get so twisted

33:42.103 --> 33:44.480
that in the end, it becomes impossible

33:44.564 --> 33:46.774
to figure out where it all went wrong.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.278
Even if you do something about it,
it just gets tangled back up again.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.655
You're right. I totally agree.

33:54.323 --> 33:56.075
I knew we'd click

33:56.159 --> 33:58.995
the moment we first met.

33:59.954 --> 34:03.082
We should've done this sooner.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.834
Tell me about it.

34:05.501 --> 34:08.171
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Thank you.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.630
Here, Director Ji.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.348
The moment she heard about him,

34:20.058 --> 34:23.019
she giggled and said

34:23.102 --> 34:25.354
she was the perfect match.

34:25.438 --> 34:29.650
I didn't know she could laugh so easily.

34:31.903 --> 34:37.116
She'd always look at me with discontent

34:37.950 --> 34:41.746
and spew such hurtful words.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.457
I thought

34:46.000 --> 34:48.711
we were meant to be.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.841
I thought I was destined

34:54.759 --> 34:58.054
to come to Gongjin

34:59.263 --> 35:01.724
so I could meet her again.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.644
Why did Cho-hui…

35:06.687 --> 35:10.733
have to disappear before I got married

35:11.859 --> 35:13.778
and show up now?

35:13.861 --> 35:14.737
No.

35:15.404 --> 35:21.327
Why did Hwa-jeong
have to ask for a divorce then?

35:23.788 --> 35:26.999
What horrible timing.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.376
Yes, timing.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.337
That's what it is.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.465
Sadly,

35:36.801 --> 35:39.971
time just never seems to be…

35:41.764 --> 35:43.307
on my side.

35:51.732 --> 35:52.733
Darn it.

35:53.943 --> 35:54.777
Oh, no.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.072
This won't come off easily.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.324
Right?

36:01.450 --> 36:02.451
Gosh.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.163
By the way, Director Ji,

36:05.663 --> 36:10.251
do you ever plan on having
female guests on your show?

36:10.334 --> 36:12.253
If you shoot season two

36:12.336 --> 36:15.423
with girl group members,
I bet it'll be a huge hit.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.843
What? Director Ji.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.811
Hey.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.147
Is Mr. Oh not here yet?

36:31.230 --> 36:33.900
He's not here yet, so relax.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.614
Today I'll have a mocha
with a ton of whipped cream.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.825
What? Are you running low
on sugar already?

36:42.909 --> 36:46.621
No. My body's overflowing with sweetness.

36:46.704 --> 36:47.997
It's overwhelming.

36:51.834 --> 36:52.793
Want to come inside?

36:53.461 --> 36:54.795
-Can I do that?
-Yes.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.716
-Okay, let's see.
-Gosh.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.136
I've never been in here before.
Look at all this.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.139
Just stand back and watch.
I don't want you causing trouble.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.224
Okay.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.433
This is whipping cream.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.602
I see.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.312
You put it in here.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.690
-This is so cool.
-Then you whip it with this.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.817
-Goodness.
-Why is this…

37:17.818 --> 37:19.320
Why won't this work?

37:23.699 --> 37:25.451
Are you okay? Did it get on you?

37:25.534 --> 37:28.371
No, I'm fine. It's all over your face.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.081
-Really?
-I'll wipe it off.

37:30.164 --> 37:33.334
-There's some here. Gosh, you're cute.
-Here?

37:33.417 --> 37:35.419
Isn't there some here?

37:35.503 --> 37:37.588
Here? You're adorable.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.466
What about here?

37:42.677 --> 37:45.596
Don't you think that was so harsh?
Forget the coffee.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.556
You're so annoying.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.770
Ms. Yoon, what did he…

37:54.021 --> 37:55.064
Du-sik.

37:56.065 --> 37:59.819
What did you say to her
to get yourself slapped in the face?

37:59.902 --> 38:01.320
That must've hurt.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.198
Why did you come so early?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.992
Why is that a problem?

38:06.075 --> 38:07.493
You wanted me to come learn.

38:07.576 --> 38:08.828
I'm just asking.

38:10.913 --> 38:14.375
That slap came out of nowhere.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.793
MS. DENTIST

38:15.876 --> 38:19.213
<i>Chief Hong, what other part-time jobs
do you have today?</i>

38:23.926 --> 38:28.306
Let's see. First, I need to go
to Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.685
Gosh, my stomach is killing me.

38:33.185 --> 38:38.774
It feels like someone reached
inside my stomach and yanked on it.

38:39.483 --> 38:40.693
You reek of alcohol.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.486
I'm guessing you had

38:43.654 --> 38:45.156
soju with <i>makgeolli.</i>

38:45.239 --> 38:46.490
Don't talk about alcohol.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.702
Have some of this. It's codfish soup.

38:49.785 --> 38:51.996
It'll soothe your stomach.

38:52.079 --> 38:55.207
Why did you drink so much?
You can't even hold your liquor.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.711
Gosh.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.382
God, I feel much better.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.551
Where did you get this?

39:05.634 --> 39:07.553
I bought it while I was outside.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.930
-Why?
-Isn't it obvious?

39:10.014 --> 39:13.184
Because you're an important person
here in Gongjin.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.395
You're a fragile and quick-tempered man

39:16.479 --> 39:18.689
who must be protected at all costs.
You're like…

39:19.815 --> 39:20.900
a fuse!

39:20.983 --> 39:22.651
That's not a compliment.

39:24.737 --> 39:27.281
Gosh, the least you can do is thank me.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.742
Here. Drink up before it gets cold.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.661
-This is really good though.
-Drink up. Slowly.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.914
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

39:34.997 --> 39:36.207
Your <i>jjajangmyeon</i> is here.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.583
Chief Hong!

39:37.666 --> 39:39.126
Hey, you're here.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.089
Will you be working there tomorrow too?

39:43.172 --> 39:44.173
Why do you ask?

39:44.256 --> 39:45.758
Do me a favor

39:45.841 --> 39:50.429
and try to work at different restaurants,
such as Korean or Japanese ones,

39:50.513 --> 39:53.099
so I can have various dishes for lunch.

39:53.182 --> 39:56.018
Chinese food shouldn't be the only option,

39:56.102 --> 39:58.813
but you're not giving me much of a choice.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.064
Hey, Mi-seon.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.275
You like Chinese food. It's good.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.360
Noted.

40:04.443 --> 40:08.614
I apologize for the trouble
I'm causing on your diet.

40:09.782 --> 40:13.452
It's okay. It's not your fault.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.997
It's my fault for having a friend
who can't control herself.

40:17.081 --> 40:20.418
Will you guys stop teasing me?

40:20.501 --> 40:21.710
Enjoy it while it's hot.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.129
Leaving already?

40:26.382 --> 40:29.135
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.553
My goodness.

40:30.636 --> 40:31.637
Chief Hong.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.764
Why aren't you eating?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.308
I want to see you a bit longer.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.644
But we saw each other this morning too.

40:38.727 --> 40:42.314
I'm sorry about earlier. I just panicked.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.442
It must've hurt.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.110
It was this side.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.487
This side? Did it hurt?
Let me blow the pain away.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.406
-Chief Hong.
-It worked.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.158
You forgot to take the fried dumplings--
Oh my!

40:54.618 --> 40:55.661
Oh, gosh.

40:55.744 --> 40:56.871
Goodness gracious.

40:57.371 --> 41:00.291
-Oh, goodness.
-How could you forget the dumplings?

41:00.374 --> 41:02.835
Don't you know how much I love
crispy dumplings?

41:03.335 --> 41:06.964
I ordered <i>tangsuyuk</i>
so I could have the free dumplings.

41:07.047 --> 41:08.090
Ms. Dentist.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.385
Ms. Yoon, I didn't peg you
as the violent type.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.387
I brought the fried dumplings.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.514
Thank you. Do your job properly.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.308
Gosh.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.938
This is why I never give freebies.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.483
Why did you bring it?
I could've picked it up myself.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.526
Don't hang out with her. Let's go.

41:27.610 --> 41:28.611
It's dented.

41:28.694 --> 41:30.279
It's okay. That doesn't matter.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.364
-Goodness, Du-sik.
-Thank you.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.491
Gosh.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.248
Jeez, it still hurts.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.585
Gosh, Ms. Dentist… Speak of the devil.

41:46.962 --> 41:47.796
Hello?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.049
Chief Hong, are you mad?

41:50.132 --> 41:51.300
No.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.969
I'm not just mad.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.597
I feel fury, frustration, rage, and anger.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.140
It's more complex.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.893
I'm so sorry. It hurt, didn't it?

42:00.976 --> 42:03.562
Be honest with me.
Are you sure you want to date me?

42:03.646 --> 42:04.855
Or do you want to kill me?

42:04.939 --> 42:07.942
No, it was Ms. Cho of all people.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.235
I hope you understand.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.947
I have no other choice.
You don't want people to know.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.365
I should respect that.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.158
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

42:16.242 --> 42:17.201
At Bora Supermarket.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.954
Okay, stay there. I'll stop by later.

42:20.037 --> 42:23.666
No, don't come. I don't want you to visit.
I got to go.

42:23.749 --> 42:24.875
See you later.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.127
He's so cute.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.809
I'm sorry. I made a huge mistake.
I apologize.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.185
Gosh, he startled me.

42:43.811 --> 42:47.565
Apologize to her. She's the one
who pulled an all-nighter.

42:47.648 --> 42:48.732
I just got here.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.901
Ji-won, what do you want to do with me?

42:50.985 --> 42:53.237
You can beat me all you want.

42:53.320 --> 42:57.449
I'll gladly receive the punishment
you give me. Go on. Hit me.

42:58.033 --> 43:00.035
Do-ha, why is he going overboard?

43:01.912 --> 43:03.372
I'm hungry. Buy me food.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.040
And use your own card.

43:05.124 --> 43:08.002
All right. Tell me what you want,
and I'll buy it for you.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.421
-Haecheong Noodles.
-Sure.

43:12.464 --> 43:13.507
Go on. Order.

43:13.591 --> 43:17.386
Okay. Where's my phone?

43:18.012 --> 43:20.389
My phone…

43:21.348 --> 43:22.558
Just wait.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.899
Found it. I'll order raw fish <i>naengmyeon</i>,
<i>mul-naengmyeon</i>,

43:30.983 --> 43:32.693
dumpling stew, and <i>galbijjim</i>.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.486
-Okay.
-Okay.

43:39.950 --> 43:42.620
-Chief Hong.
-No, don't come near me.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.538
-Why not?
-Stay at least two meters away from me

43:44.622 --> 43:46.707
when we're outside
for the sake of my safety.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.586
Two meters? Is this enough?

43:50.669 --> 43:53.088
That's not two meters.
That's not even one meter.

43:53.172 --> 43:58.177
I think you and I
have different measurement standards.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.929
I'd like you to follow
the international standard.

44:01.013 --> 44:03.682
"I'd like you to follow
the international standard."

44:06.101 --> 44:07.686
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

44:07.770 --> 44:11.565
How about we go
on our first official date this weekend?

44:11.649 --> 44:12.691
A date?

44:13.734 --> 44:15.152
What do you have in mind?

44:15.235 --> 44:16.570
On our date…

44:18.072 --> 44:19.990
We could go for a walk,

44:20.074 --> 44:21.367
have food,

44:22.826 --> 44:25.746
and if you want, we can do

44:26.455 --> 44:27.456
some other stuff too.

44:29.958 --> 44:30.959
Like what?

44:31.043 --> 44:33.379
-Just some other stuff.
-Like this?

44:33.462 --> 44:34.880
Stop it!

44:34.963 --> 44:36.965
-Why?
-You're ruining my hair.

44:37.049 --> 44:39.009
You still look pretty.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.052
Stop it!

44:40.135 --> 44:42.805
-I thought I told you not to.
-I'm sorry.

44:44.223 --> 44:46.308
I told you to stop.
Stop being so annoying.

44:46.392 --> 44:47.643
Why is it so warm?

44:53.148 --> 44:54.149
I'm bleeding.

44:56.568 --> 44:58.237
Don't do that again.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.655
Gosh.

44:59.738 --> 45:00.697
I'm sorry.

45:04.993 --> 45:08.747
Did you see that?
Ms. Yoon didn't even hesitate

45:08.831 --> 45:10.833
to headbutt him.

45:10.916 --> 45:13.544
I agree. It's safe to say

45:15.045 --> 45:16.964
that she despises him.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.099
I should get going.

45:27.182 --> 45:30.352
Okay. Cheer up.

45:30.436 --> 45:31.478
Bye.

45:35.065 --> 45:37.776
I'M SORRY. HOW'S YOUR NOSE?

45:37.860 --> 45:41.321
DID YOUR NOSE STOP BLEEDING? I'M SORRY…

45:41.405 --> 45:44.700
-I'm truly sorry.
-Dr. Yoon, you have a patient.

45:44.783 --> 45:45.951
Coming.

45:48.662 --> 45:49.663
I'm sorry.

45:50.622 --> 45:54.042
I feel so bad. I'm so sorry, Chief Hong.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.712
YOUR CHEEK, SHIN, AND NOSE…
I'M SORRY, CHIEF HONG

46:00.424 --> 46:02.968
Hey, aren't you getting off?

46:03.886 --> 46:04.970
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

46:05.053 --> 46:09.099
Why do you think Chief Hong hasn't checked
his texts for the past five hours?

46:10.350 --> 46:11.310
Because he's busy?

46:11.977 --> 46:13.479
Even so,

46:13.562 --> 46:16.023
how could he not have time
to check his phone?

46:17.065 --> 46:18.150
Is he mad at me?

46:19.401 --> 46:20.444
Or did he block me?

46:21.111 --> 46:22.696
He hasn't read any of my texts.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.657
Did he block me?

46:25.741 --> 46:27.242
I'm sorry, my friend.

46:28.577 --> 46:29.578
For what?

46:30.245 --> 46:33.499
I was just like you now
when I was in a relationship.

46:33.582 --> 46:36.835
God, it must've been so annoying.

46:36.919 --> 46:40.255
You learn the most by putting yourself
in other people's shoes.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.466
-Am I so annoying right now?
-Yes.

46:42.549 --> 46:43.967
Am I being cringy?

46:44.760 --> 46:45.886
I'm going home.

46:47.721 --> 46:51.475
Why won't he read my texts?
It's bothering me so much.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.359
Is he not home?

47:02.069 --> 47:05.113
Should I wait for him
and make him feel better?

47:14.081 --> 47:17.042
He's tidier than he seems.

47:25.425 --> 47:27.511
How did I not recognize him?

47:28.512 --> 47:30.013
He looks exactly the same.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.807
How adorable.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.852
Gosh, he's so cute.

47:41.483 --> 47:42.484
How adorable.

47:45.654 --> 47:47.781
I love that he reads a lot.

47:53.537 --> 47:54.871
<i>What Is Love?</i>

47:54.955 --> 47:57.666
All right. Come on in.

47:57.749 --> 47:58.834
-Okay.
-What?

47:59.418 --> 48:02.421
-Try the candle that he made.
-Is he not alone?

48:02.504 --> 48:04.047
-What do I do?
-It's really nice.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.592
-Is it really that nice?
-You bet.

48:06.675 --> 48:09.636
I always make the best quality goods.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.723
Why are the lights on?

48:12.806 --> 48:14.725
Come on in.

48:14.808 --> 48:16.602
-The lights are on.
-Come on.

48:16.685 --> 48:18.812
Goodness. It's late.

48:20.522 --> 48:23.191
Hold on. There's a lot of dust.

48:23.692 --> 48:24.776
It's dusty in here.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.403
You guys are important guests.

48:26.486 --> 48:29.114
Why don't you wait outside?
I'll bring them out.

48:29.197 --> 48:32.034
Chief Hong, I need to use your bathroom.

48:32.117 --> 48:33.368
No! Wait.

48:34.494 --> 48:36.288
-Hold on.
-Gosh.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.665
Goodness.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.960
-It's over there, right?
-Yes. You know where it is.

48:42.044 --> 48:45.464
Why don't you sit down?
I'll go bring them.

48:45.547 --> 48:47.716
My room's messy, so don't go inside.

48:47.799 --> 48:51.178
Messy? Don't be absurd.

48:51.261 --> 48:53.263
I've never seen

48:53.347 --> 48:56.308
a young man as tidy as you in my life.

48:56.391 --> 48:58.143
No, it's really messy today.

48:58.226 --> 49:00.896
You're starting to make me curious.

49:01.396 --> 49:02.773
-Let's see.
-No!

49:08.111 --> 49:10.864
Come on. It's neat and tidy.

49:10.947 --> 49:13.492
I must've forgotten
that I had cleaned up already.

49:15.202 --> 49:18.830
Gosh, silly me.
I'm so forgetful these days.

49:18.914 --> 49:20.916
Come see my candles.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.959
-Okay.
-Okay?

49:25.003 --> 49:30.092
All right. Check them out.
I don't make them often.

49:30.175 --> 49:33.512
I made these masterpieces
with bean oil, wooden wicks,

49:33.595 --> 49:36.348
and natural ingredients.

49:36.431 --> 49:39.351
They're filled with essential oils,
so they even smell nice.

49:39.935 --> 49:42.646
-Here. Smell them.
-Okay.

49:43.897 --> 49:46.858
You're right. They really do smell nice.

49:47.526 --> 49:48.610
It smells like flowers.

49:48.694 --> 49:49.903
-Right?
-Yes.

49:51.321 --> 49:52.322
She's here.

49:53.615 --> 49:56.243
I'm feeling generous today.
You don't need to pay.

49:56.326 --> 49:57.953
I'll give them to you for free,

49:58.036 --> 49:59.037
-What?
-so take them.

49:59.121 --> 50:00.914
Two for each person. All right.

50:00.997 --> 50:02.124
Goodness.

50:02.207 --> 50:04.459
Never mind. Just take them all. Here.

50:04.543 --> 50:06.503
-All of them?
-Yes, take them all.

50:06.586 --> 50:08.922
Are we good now? Go home and light them.

50:09.005 --> 50:11.466
See how nice they are for yourself.

50:11.550 --> 50:12.676
-Okay.
-Now, go home.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.553
-Let's go.
-What?

50:15.053 --> 50:16.430
-Go on.
-Okay.

50:16.513 --> 50:19.433
-Go home and light your candles.
-All right.

50:19.516 --> 50:20.475
Go on.

50:20.559 --> 50:23.103
I won't see you out today.

50:23.186 --> 50:24.563
Get home safely.

50:24.646 --> 50:26.314
-I need to clean my house.
-Okay.

50:26.398 --> 50:28.483
-Goodness.
-Let's go.

50:28.567 --> 50:31.069
They're nice.
Don't they smell good, Ms. Suk-ja?

50:31.153 --> 50:32.404
-Yes.
-Right.

50:33.447 --> 50:34.865
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

50:34.948 --> 50:35.782
Bye.

50:41.079 --> 50:44.291
Doesn't he seem suspicious today?
He didn't even offer us drinks.

50:44.958 --> 50:48.128
You're right. Is he in a hurry
to do something?

50:48.211 --> 50:50.547
Ladies, light these candles in your room,

50:50.630 --> 50:53.425
and any foul smells will be gone.

50:53.967 --> 50:56.052
My grandson came over last time

50:56.136 --> 50:59.055
and said my house smelled musty.

50:59.848 --> 51:01.767
Did that hurt your feelings?

51:01.850 --> 51:02.851
A bit.

51:03.351 --> 51:06.480
There's no need to feel hurt
or embarrassed.

51:06.563 --> 51:08.815
It's the law of nature.

51:08.899 --> 51:12.194
It's only natural for old people like us
to smell this way.

51:12.277 --> 51:14.863
That's why you need to shower

51:14.946 --> 51:17.240
and bathe in hot water often.

51:17.324 --> 51:21.036
Use Chief Hong's handmade soap,
and it'll get rid of your bad odor.

51:21.119 --> 51:24.539
Then how about we go
to the bathhouse tomorrow?

51:24.623 --> 51:27.751
-Okay?
-Don't walk so close to me in this heat.

51:27.834 --> 51:28.960
Stop clinging on to me.

51:29.044 --> 51:31.171
Ms. Dentist, where…

51:31.254 --> 51:32.255
Ms. Dentist.

51:50.398 --> 51:51.900
Are the ladies gone?

51:51.983 --> 51:54.027
Yes. Why are you here?
You should've called.

51:54.611 --> 51:58.698
Well, I couldn't reach you.
You didn't even check your texts.

51:58.782 --> 52:01.660
I was busy today.

52:02.494 --> 52:04.704
Wait. Where's my cell phone?

52:05.831 --> 52:06.748
You lost it?

52:06.832 --> 52:09.376
I'm sure it's somewhere. Get out of there.

52:09.459 --> 52:10.502
Okay.

52:13.964 --> 52:17.342
I've been crouching so long
that my legs fell asleep.

52:17.425 --> 52:18.677
Come here.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.136
-What are you doing?
-There.

52:21.054 --> 52:22.931
-What are you doing?
-Are you good now?

52:24.558 --> 52:25.809
Aren't I heavy?

52:25.892 --> 52:28.061
You're as heavy as a sack of rice.

52:29.312 --> 52:30.522
Put me down.

52:30.605 --> 52:32.440
No, let's stay like this for a bit.

52:33.108 --> 52:34.192
Gosh.

52:34.901 --> 52:36.278
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

52:36.361 --> 52:40.615
You should check your texts
no matter how busy you are.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.492
I don't like it when I can't reach you.

52:42.576 --> 52:43.910
Okay, I will.

52:44.744 --> 52:46.371
What else? Tell me more.

52:46.454 --> 52:49.249
What else don't you like?
Tell me everything.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.544
-What don't I like?
-Yes.

52:52.627 --> 52:55.547
Here's one. I don't want you to lie.

52:59.426 --> 53:02.888
I don't want there
to be any secrets between us.

53:06.766 --> 53:08.059
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

53:08.643 --> 53:10.186
Walk three steps forward.

53:10.270 --> 53:11.104
Sure.

53:12.105 --> 53:14.149
-That's so cute.
-Why?

53:14.232 --> 53:16.401
Did you mark our first day as a couple?

53:16.484 --> 53:19.154
Gosh, no. It's nothing.

53:19.237 --> 53:22.157
What do you mean it's nothing?
That's so adorable.

53:22.240 --> 53:25.201
No, it's not what you think.
It's for something else. I just…

53:53.605 --> 53:54.898
It's Mi-seon.

53:54.981 --> 53:57.233
Why is the ringtone so loud?

53:58.193 --> 54:00.779
Do you also want an aroma candle?

54:00.862 --> 54:03.198
-An aroma candle?
-Maybe a eucalyptus-scented one.

54:03.281 --> 54:05.617
It's good for rhinitis.
It opens up your sinuses.

54:06.368 --> 54:07.577
I see.

54:08.203 --> 54:11.706
I don't have rhinitis, but thanks.

54:15.710 --> 54:19.005
Gosh, why did Mi-seon have to call
at that moment?

54:19.089 --> 54:21.383
I should mute it from now on.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.139
Do you also certified for making candles?

54:28.223 --> 54:29.599
Yes, of course.

54:31.226 --> 54:35.146
Tell me honestly.
How many licenses do you own?

54:35.230 --> 54:37.857
I'm not sure. I have so many
that I've lost count.

54:37.941 --> 54:41.236
Then tell me the most eccentric one?

54:41.319 --> 54:42.237
The most eccentric?

54:43.113 --> 54:46.533
Let's see. I have a class-three license
to counsel youths,

54:46.616 --> 54:48.702
-and licenses to teach etiquette,
-Okay.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.954
to cook pufferfish,

54:51.037 --> 54:55.000
to clean and tidy up,
and to teach origami.

54:55.083 --> 54:58.962
To teach origami?
They even have a license for that?

54:59.045 --> 55:03.675
Colored paper can hold
the whole universe, you dummy.

55:03.758 --> 55:06.594
Dummy? That's so mean.

55:06.678 --> 55:09.097
I can't believe you called me that.

55:10.974 --> 55:12.767
That hurts! My hand!

55:12.851 --> 55:15.020
-Let me go!
-Oh, my goodness!

55:15.103 --> 55:16.646
-Have you lost it?
-What's wrong?

55:16.730 --> 55:19.441
-Are you okay?
-Gosh, I'm terrified of her.

55:19.524 --> 55:21.484
-My goodness.
-She's so strong.

55:21.568 --> 55:25.238
I heard what you did.
Ms. Yoon, you've gone too far.

55:25.321 --> 55:27.991
-Pardon?
-Come on. We saw what you did.

55:28.074 --> 55:29.451
You're so harsh on him.

55:29.534 --> 55:32.078
No one does that
even to their worst enemy.

55:32.162 --> 55:35.331
She's right. You even made his nose bleed
at the supermarket.

55:35.415 --> 55:37.459
-You even kicked him.
-And slapped him.

55:37.542 --> 55:39.794
Gosh, she even slapped you?
You're unbelievable.

55:39.878 --> 55:42.172
No, we were just talking and--

55:42.255 --> 55:45.884
This won't do. At this rate,
Chief Hong could get badly injured.

55:45.967 --> 55:49.095
I was just going to tell you
to be nice to him,

55:49.179 --> 55:50.722
but you've crossed the line.

55:50.805 --> 55:52.682
Don't meet each other for a while.

55:52.766 --> 55:56.269
-Yes, that's a good idea.
-Don't even look him in the eye.

55:56.352 --> 55:58.063
Just avoid and ignore each other.

55:58.146 --> 56:01.441
Gosh, that's impossible.
Gongjin is a tiny neighborhood.

56:01.524 --> 56:03.735
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.

56:03.818 --> 56:04.944
We can make it work.

56:05.028 --> 56:06.071
Ms. Yoon, come with us.

56:06.154 --> 56:07.781
Let's go.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.825
-Let's go. Come on.
-Stop letting her beat you up.

56:10.909 --> 56:12.744
-It breaks my heart.
-Hey, Geum-cheol.

56:12.827 --> 56:14.079
-Let them go.
-We're off.

56:14.162 --> 56:15.955
-He deserves more beating.
-Gosh.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.540
That hurts.

56:17.624 --> 56:20.001
Why are you such a wuss?

56:20.085 --> 56:22.212
-No, that's not it.
-Gosh!

56:22.295 --> 56:23.922
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

56:31.429 --> 56:32.680
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

56:33.348 --> 56:34.390
Hello.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.935
-Hey--
-Chief Hong, stay there.

56:37.018 --> 56:39.562
Continue what you were doing.
I'll take her order.

56:40.522 --> 56:42.649
One cup of iced drip coffee, please.

56:43.858 --> 56:45.777
One cup of iced drip coffee.

56:45.860 --> 56:48.238
And use her favorite beans,
Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.

56:48.321 --> 56:50.365
-I heard.
-Okay.

56:51.533 --> 56:52.367
Sit back there.

56:52.450 --> 56:54.119
I don't want to wrinkle my skirt.

56:54.202 --> 56:55.411
I see.

56:55.995 --> 56:57.539
-Chief Hong--
-Stop!

56:57.622 --> 56:59.916
Why would you try to talk to him?

56:59.999 --> 57:02.085
You shouldn't talk to each other
from now on.

57:02.168 --> 57:04.546
You always fight when you do.
Keep some distance.

57:06.422 --> 57:08.007
Hey, Chun-jae.

57:08.091 --> 57:09.592
-Me? What?
-Yes.

57:09.676 --> 57:11.636
-I lost my phone.
-Your phone?

57:11.719 --> 57:16.724
Yes. You won't be able
to reach me by phone until I find it.

57:16.808 --> 57:19.894
-I see.
-I only just bought it,

57:19.978 --> 57:22.439
so I think I should try looking for it
for a few days.

57:22.522 --> 57:23.898
Yes, I think so too.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.943
So don't worry even if you can't reach me.

57:27.026 --> 57:30.071
Why would I worry about you?
I'm busy worrying about Ju-ri.

57:30.155 --> 57:32.115
-Is it Sunday today?
-Hi, guys.

57:32.198 --> 57:34.742
Why are you here at this hour?

57:34.826 --> 57:36.202
You're late for school!

57:36.286 --> 57:38.580
Just be relieved
that I'm going to school. See you.

57:39.164 --> 57:40.790
She's such a handful.

57:40.874 --> 57:43.293
Gosh, she gives me headaches.

57:43.376 --> 57:45.336
What should I do with her, Du-sik?

57:46.546 --> 57:49.090
-But she's cute--
-Stop looking elsewhere. Look at me.

57:49.174 --> 57:51.509
I'm going to make coffee.
Which beans again?

57:51.593 --> 57:52.552
What was it again?

57:53.136 --> 57:54.387
-Ethiopian.
-Ethiopian.

57:54.471 --> 57:55.763
-Ethiopian?
-Drip coffee.

57:55.847 --> 57:57.432
-Drip coffee.
-Drip coffee.

57:57.515 --> 58:00.602
I can't believe we have to be apart
when we just started dating.

58:01.478 --> 58:05.565
Why did Chief Hong lose his phone?
I can't even text him now.

58:05.648 --> 58:07.650
I want to hear his voice.

58:07.734 --> 58:09.694
Gosh, you're so annoying.

58:09.777 --> 58:12.113
I have great respect for our ancestors.

58:12.197 --> 58:17.243
They didn't have phones back then.
How did they date and make babies?

58:19.746 --> 58:22.040
Mi-seon, for lunch--

58:22.123 --> 58:23.917
Shark fin soup and spicy <i>nurungji</i> soup.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.544
If I must have Chinese,
I want the most expensive dishes.

58:29.380 --> 58:32.300
This is Yoon Dental Clinic.
Two bowls of <i>jjajangmyeon</i>, please.

58:33.176 --> 58:34.886
-Thanks.
-Shark fin soup.

58:34.969 --> 58:36.721
Chief Hong is coming.

58:36.804 --> 58:38.014
You're so annoying.

58:41.351 --> 58:43.144
Ms. Cho, you came yourself.

58:43.228 --> 58:46.231
Yes, Chief Hong
won't be delivering food here for now.

58:46.314 --> 58:48.441
We weren't joking yesterday.

58:49.192 --> 58:51.528
But why didn't you order
<i>tangsuyuk</i> as well?

58:51.611 --> 58:53.071
You could've just come.

58:53.154 --> 58:55.657
I can't believe
I came all the way here for this.

58:57.283 --> 58:58.826
Why does she keep slapping me?

58:59.827 --> 59:04.082
We have two additional people to board
along with the staff we mentioned.

59:04.165 --> 59:05.250
Is that okay?

59:05.333 --> 59:07.085
Yes, that's no problem.

59:07.168 --> 59:09.504
Will there be turbulence?
I heard it'll be sunny.

59:09.587 --> 59:11.839
I think it'll be a bit wavy.

59:11.923 --> 59:15.260
You'll just have to take
anti-seasickness tablets and wear patches.

59:18.054 --> 59:20.223
What's the matter? Are you okay?

59:20.306 --> 59:21.349
What's wrong?

59:21.432 --> 59:22.976
-Are you sick?
-You're sweating.

59:23.059 --> 59:24.852
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

59:29.983 --> 59:34.237
The lunch was delicious,
so I must've stuffed it too quickly.

59:34.904 --> 59:36.364
I'm really fine.

59:36.447 --> 59:39.242
You don't have to stand here.
Go sit down somewhere.

59:39.867 --> 59:41.286
Or go home.

59:41.369 --> 59:43.413
Are you serious?

59:43.496 --> 59:45.206
I can't leave you alone here.

59:46.749 --> 59:47.834
I'm fine now.

59:47.917 --> 59:50.253
No. You're not fine.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.046
Upset stomach, my foot.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.674
I know it's your heart that's hurting.

59:56.926 --> 59:58.803
I already paid your hospital bills.

59:59.345 --> 1:00:02.015
Do you have insurance?
If you do, we need the receipt.

1:00:02.098 --> 1:00:04.309
Do-ha, you handle things very quickly.

1:00:04.934 --> 1:00:07.103
Why can't you be like that at work?

1:00:07.186 --> 1:00:09.689
Well, my father was hospitalized
for a long time.

1:00:09.772 --> 1:00:11.733
So I know how things are done here.

1:00:11.816 --> 1:00:14.402
I should've gone to med school,
but my grades didn't cut it.

1:00:14.485 --> 1:00:16.112
Gosh, come on.

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:19.073
It's not too late.

1:00:24.203 --> 1:00:25.538
Chief Hong!

1:00:27.582 --> 1:00:29.751
Hey. Wait.

1:00:31.210 --> 1:00:32.920
Why is it so hard to see you?

1:00:33.004 --> 1:00:35.673
Tell me about it.
How have you been for the past six hours?

1:00:35.757 --> 1:00:37.258
Not so well.

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:40.511
Did you find your phone?

1:00:40.595 --> 1:00:43.056
-No, not yet.
-Then get a new one.

1:00:43.139 --> 1:00:44.223
Don't you want to text?

1:00:44.307 --> 1:00:47.769
My contract still has 20 months on it.
Give me one more day to look for it.

1:00:47.852 --> 1:00:51.272
Are you saying
we'll continue to be out of touch?

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:53.232
No, that's not what I mean. I'll--

1:00:53.316 --> 1:00:54.609
-Ms. Yoon!
-Du-sik!

1:00:54.692 --> 1:00:56.694
What's going on? Arguing again?

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:57.987
-No, we're not.
-We're not. We're--

1:00:58.071 --> 1:00:59.822
Ms. Yoon, I heard everything.

1:00:59.906 --> 1:01:03.159
Please keep a distance
to maintain peace in Gongjin.

1:01:03.242 --> 1:01:05.411
This isn't the JSA. That's enough.

1:01:05.495 --> 1:01:06.996
-Honey, split them up.
-Split!

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:08.748
-Ms. Yoon, follow me.
-Come with me.

1:01:08.831 --> 1:01:10.541
-I'll give you a popsicle.
-No, wait.

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:12.794
-I don't like popsicles.
-Yun-gyeong.

1:01:12.877 --> 1:01:14.962
-Yun-gyeong.
-What do you like then?

1:01:15.046 --> 1:01:17.256
-Bye.
-Bye!

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:18.549
But…

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:26.641
What are you doing?

1:01:27.266 --> 1:01:28.267
Lie down.

1:01:28.935 --> 1:01:30.395
I'm not sleepy.

1:01:31.688 --> 1:01:34.440
Then what? Should I force you to lie down?

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:37.819
No. I'll lie down myself.

1:01:40.154 --> 1:01:41.322
Gosh.

1:01:45.785 --> 1:01:47.912
I'm not doing this for you.

1:01:47.995 --> 1:01:51.457
If you're going to fall ill,
do it after our show is finished.

1:01:52.166 --> 1:01:53.418
Fine.

1:01:55.002 --> 1:01:57.004
Now, get some sleep.

1:01:57.088 --> 1:01:58.214
Thanks.

1:01:59.799 --> 1:02:02.301
I know you care for me

1:02:02.802 --> 1:02:04.429
and put up with me a lot.

1:02:05.513 --> 1:02:07.682
I'm truly grateful.

1:02:12.603 --> 1:02:14.897
I can't believe this happened.

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:18.192
I can't believe someone as healthy as me

1:02:18.276 --> 1:02:20.445
was taken to the ER
because of an upset stomach.

1:02:20.945 --> 1:02:22.196
You should be embarrassed.

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:28.035
I'm dumbfounded and speechless.

1:02:30.079 --> 1:02:31.831
But I guess I've been distressed.

1:02:34.917 --> 1:02:36.169
I'm trying to get over

1:02:37.712 --> 1:02:40.214
my first love for the second time.

1:02:47.096 --> 1:02:49.098
My heart's been broken once again,

1:02:50.725 --> 1:02:52.143
and it hurts so much.

1:02:55.313 --> 1:02:57.148
That's enough.

1:02:57.231 --> 1:02:59.150
It'd be cute if you were a teenager,

1:02:59.233 --> 1:03:02.111
but you're 35.
It could really take a toll on you.

1:03:03.237 --> 1:03:04.614
You're right.

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:08.159
Now, close your eyes.

1:03:11.245 --> 1:03:13.748
I should do as you say.

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:16.584
I'm going to sleep.

1:03:25.802 --> 1:03:28.054
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:29.680
Let's see.

1:03:39.190 --> 1:03:40.149
Hello.

1:03:41.818 --> 1:03:44.153
What brings you here?

1:03:44.237 --> 1:03:45.279
Well…

1:03:46.864 --> 1:03:48.157
I…

1:03:49.283 --> 1:03:52.286
I'd like to get a teeth scaling.

1:03:52.370 --> 1:03:53.788
A scaling?

1:03:55.706 --> 1:03:57.917
Sure. Please wait over there for a minute.

1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.001
Okay.

1:04:01.712 --> 1:04:02.797
Sure.

1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:06.467
Hold onto this.
I brought it in case you get nervous.

1:04:06.551 --> 1:04:08.636
Okay. Thank you.

1:04:12.390 --> 1:04:14.016
Open your mouth.

1:04:14.559 --> 1:04:16.561
I'm going to be as gentle as possible.

1:04:16.644 --> 1:04:20.189
But raise your hand if it hurts too much.

1:04:20.273 --> 1:04:21.274
Okay.

1:04:30.366 --> 1:04:32.743
Is there something wrong?

1:04:34.287 --> 1:04:35.454
You see,

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:40.710
it's not that I don't like you.

1:04:41.544 --> 1:04:46.591
I just want to get to know you slowly.

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:49.135
I'm sure

1:04:50.011 --> 1:04:53.931
you can make out what I'm saying.

1:04:56.767 --> 1:04:58.895
I'm afraid I don't get what you're saying.

1:04:59.687 --> 1:05:03.441
If it's okay with you, I'll proceed.

1:05:03.524 --> 1:05:04.525
Okay.

1:05:09.864 --> 1:05:11.824
I thought she'd make it out.

1:05:17.830 --> 1:05:19.123
What did he say?

1:05:19.206 --> 1:05:20.458
-What?
-Why did he come?

1:05:21.250 --> 1:05:22.168
Don't ask.

1:05:22.251 --> 1:05:25.671
Look at you. Why do you look happy?

1:05:26.380 --> 1:05:28.299
You have a huge smile on your face.

1:05:28.382 --> 1:05:29.926
He said something, didn't he?

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:31.761
It's a secret.

1:05:33.137 --> 1:05:37.016
Hey, I tell you everything.
You can't do this to me.

1:05:37.099 --> 1:05:41.604
Wait. Your next patient, Hyun Yeong-mok,
will be here in ten minutes.

1:05:41.687 --> 1:05:43.397
Come on. Tell me.

1:05:43.481 --> 1:05:47.693
Stretch your arms beforehand.
It's an impacted wisdom teeth removal.

1:05:48.569 --> 1:05:51.614
Come on. I'm dying of curiosity. Tell me.

1:05:51.697 --> 1:05:53.449
Are you really not going to tell me?

1:05:53.532 --> 1:05:55.451
I'm so curious.

1:05:55.534 --> 1:05:57.787
Gosh, you're smiling from ear to ear.

1:05:57.870 --> 1:05:59.038
I'm not.

1:05:59.705 --> 1:06:00.623
Tell me.

1:06:02.375 --> 1:06:03.376
Why are you smiling?

1:06:03.459 --> 1:06:04.752
It's a secret.

1:06:05.836 --> 1:06:09.590
This is so unfair.
I won't tell you anything ever again.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:11.300
Not a single thing.

1:06:12.343 --> 1:06:13.344
What's with her?

1:06:15.179 --> 1:06:17.223
I miss him.

1:06:17.306 --> 1:06:18.933
I want to see him.

1:06:19.433 --> 1:06:21.018
I miss him.

1:06:21.102 --> 1:06:22.770
I want to see him.

1:06:28.109 --> 1:06:29.276
Hello?

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:30.361
<i>Ms. Dentist.</i>

1:06:31.529 --> 1:06:32.530
Chief Hong.

1:06:33.531 --> 1:06:36.492
Where are you? When can we meet?

1:06:36.575 --> 1:06:38.077
<i>I don't think we can meet today.</i>

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:41.747
<i>People will gather at the community center
for a neighborhood meeting tomorrow,</i>

1:06:41.831 --> 1:06:44.000
<i>so I'll see you then.
Come to my house, okay?</i>

1:06:44.083 --> 1:06:46.627
Hello? Chief Hong. Chief…

1:06:49.088 --> 1:06:49.922
Tomorrow?

1:06:50.423 --> 1:06:52.383
That's too long.

1:06:54.844 --> 1:06:56.804
I can't wait that long.

1:06:56.887 --> 1:07:00.516
This is so unfair.

1:07:13.904 --> 1:07:15.114
I'm seeing her today.

1:07:21.871 --> 1:07:23.622
Yes. Let's wear this.

1:07:25.750 --> 1:07:26.709
Let's see.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:37.970
Time is passing by so slowly.

1:07:38.596 --> 1:07:39.972
All right.

1:07:44.852 --> 1:07:45.686
Gosh.

1:07:46.854 --> 1:07:48.898
Two and a half hours left.

1:07:51.859 --> 1:07:53.319
My heart's fluttering.

1:07:56.822 --> 1:07:58.282
Hold on. Why…

1:07:58.783 --> 1:08:01.327
Why won't the sun go down?

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:02.578
I hope it will soon.

1:08:05.372 --> 1:08:09.126
Oh, no. Darn it.

1:08:11.670 --> 1:08:13.714
Mi-seon, I'm going on a date.

1:08:16.550 --> 1:08:17.426
Bye.

1:08:18.469 --> 1:08:19.678
Unbelievable.

1:08:21.472 --> 1:08:24.934
She's been single for way too long.

1:08:25.684 --> 1:08:27.561
She's having a blast.

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.023
It's not like it's her first date.

1:08:31.774 --> 1:08:36.737
<i>Exercising in the moonlight
Because I can't sleep</i>

1:08:36.821 --> 1:08:39.698
<i>But this chaotic life</i>

1:08:39.782 --> 1:08:43.244
<i>Du-sik, let's go
To the neighborhood meeting</i>

1:08:44.286 --> 1:08:46.413
-What's wrong?
-I'm sorry,

1:08:47.289 --> 1:08:48.707
but I'm not feeling well.

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:50.793
You must've overworked yourself.

1:08:50.876 --> 1:08:53.754
Yes, I think so.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1:08:54.839 --> 1:08:57.133
Can you tell them that I can't make it?

1:08:57.216 --> 1:08:59.343
Okay, I'll do that.

1:08:59.426 --> 1:09:00.761
Go home. Don't worry.

1:09:02.596 --> 1:09:04.223
I feel bad for not attending.

1:09:04.306 --> 1:09:05.891
Just go home. It'll be fine.

1:09:06.892 --> 1:09:08.102
I'll be going then.

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:11.105
-What's wrong with me?
-Bye.

1:09:40.050 --> 1:09:42.261
Why aren't they coming? Gosh.

1:09:43.804 --> 1:09:46.432
Hey, Yeong-guk.
I mean, Mr. Chang. Over here.

1:09:46.515 --> 1:09:49.977
What is it? Why did you make me come
all the way here?

1:09:50.060 --> 1:09:52.897
I have a very important matter to discuss,

1:09:52.980 --> 1:09:56.734
so you should be here
as the village chief. There's Hwa-jeong.

1:09:57.526 --> 1:09:59.278
Ms. Yu, you're here too.

1:09:59.361 --> 1:10:02.364
Of course. She's also a resident here.

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:04.658
-Right.
-Hello, Nam-suk.

1:10:04.742 --> 1:10:08.996
"Nam-suk"? Goodness,
you're awfully friendly.

1:10:09.079 --> 1:10:11.582
I don't think we were ever that close.

1:10:11.665 --> 1:10:13.042
We just never got the chance.

1:10:13.125 --> 1:10:16.629
I can be quite friendly. I'm pretty funny
too once you get to know me.

1:10:16.712 --> 1:10:18.547
I hope we get along.

1:10:18.631 --> 1:10:20.674
Sure. You are funny. I got it.

1:10:22.384 --> 1:10:24.470
Yeong-guk, have you been doing well?

1:10:24.553 --> 1:10:26.597
Of course, I have been doing great.

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.683
I eat, breathe, and sleep well.

1:10:30.476 --> 1:10:31.685
But you couldn't poop.

1:10:31.769 --> 1:10:32.895
What?

1:10:33.562 --> 1:10:35.189
Why would you say that?

1:10:35.272 --> 1:10:37.316
I can tell by the color of your face.

1:10:37.399 --> 1:10:38.692
You're constipated.

1:10:38.776 --> 1:10:40.694
No, I'm not!

1:10:41.528 --> 1:10:43.447
Do you want some dandelion pills?

1:10:43.530 --> 1:10:46.283
-Stop talking nonsense!
-Don't get all worked up.

1:10:46.367 --> 1:10:48.160
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:49.954
I'm here on behalf

1:10:50.037 --> 1:10:51.705
-of Hye-jin.
-I'm glad you came.

1:10:51.789 --> 1:10:53.207
-Thank you.
-You look pretty.

1:10:53.290 --> 1:10:55.167
-Goodness. Hi, guys.
-Gosh.

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:57.211
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:10:57.294 --> 1:10:59.046
Hi, Bo-ra.

1:10:59.129 --> 1:11:00.130
Okay.

1:11:01.173 --> 1:11:04.134
Where are your manners? Say hello!

1:11:04.218 --> 1:11:05.761
Hello!

1:11:05.844 --> 1:11:06.804
-Hi!
-Hey!

1:11:07.304 --> 1:11:08.597
Good job.

1:11:08.681 --> 1:11:10.599
-Where's I-jun?
-Right. Where is he?

1:11:10.683 --> 1:11:13.185
He's staying at the restaurant
with the kitchen ladies.

1:11:13.269 --> 1:11:15.020
He wanted to solve math problems.

1:11:15.104 --> 1:11:17.815
I brought some jelly to share with him.

1:11:17.898 --> 1:11:18.774
-She did.
-Really?

1:11:18.857 --> 1:11:21.402
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:11:21.986 --> 1:11:23.946
What are you all doing out here?

1:11:24.029 --> 1:11:27.283
Why are you outside?
The mosquitoes will eat you up.

1:11:27.366 --> 1:11:29.410
By the way, what's today's agenda?

1:11:29.493 --> 1:11:31.036
-Oh, it's--
-Am I late?

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:32.454
-Hey.
-Have you been waiting?

1:11:32.538 --> 1:11:33.706
Yes.

1:11:33.789 --> 1:11:35.082
Gosh. What is it?

1:11:35.165 --> 1:11:37.960
You must be curious about today's agenda.

1:11:38.043 --> 1:11:40.045
-Yes.
-Let me tell you.

1:11:40.129 --> 1:11:41.171
What is it about?

1:11:52.766 --> 1:11:54.101
Chief Hong!

1:12:06.196 --> 1:12:08.198
I've missed you so much.

1:12:08.699 --> 1:12:09.992
Me too.

1:12:12.870 --> 1:12:14.955
I hate that I can't see you often.

1:12:15.039 --> 1:12:15.956
Me too.

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:17.666
I want to see you every day.

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:20.127
I want to hear your voice every day.

1:12:20.711 --> 1:12:22.671
I want to hug you every day.

1:12:22.755 --> 1:12:23.672
Me too.

1:12:24.173 --> 1:12:27.009
Is that all you can say?

1:12:31.430 --> 1:12:33.640
I lived for 34 years without you,

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:36.518
but each day seems to last forever

1:12:37.227 --> 1:12:38.729
since I've met you.

1:12:40.105 --> 1:12:42.274
Hye-jin, what's your deal?

1:12:42.775 --> 1:12:44.526
What have you done to me?

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:48.489
Say it again.

1:12:49.114 --> 1:12:51.158
-Say what?
-My name.

1:12:53.327 --> 1:12:54.328
Hye-jin.

1:12:55.788 --> 1:12:56.789
Yoon Hye-jin.

1:12:58.707 --> 1:13:01.210
I've heard people
call my name millions of times.

1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:03.420
But it sounds unfamiliar now.

1:13:05.756 --> 1:13:07.341
As if I've got a new name.

1:13:13.889 --> 1:13:16.475
Gosh. I can't take it anymore.

1:13:16.558 --> 1:13:19.853
-She has a weak stomach.
-I'm sorry. She vomited.

1:13:19.937 --> 1:13:22.815
-Chief Hong, what are you…
-What a coincidence.

1:13:22.898 --> 1:13:25.067
It's… It's a misunderstanding.

1:13:25.150 --> 1:13:28.070
You see, you got it all wrong.

1:13:28.153 --> 1:13:29.405
-I see.
-I see.

1:13:29.488 --> 1:13:31.198
-Right.
-It's a misunderstanding.

1:13:32.199 --> 1:13:33.325
So…

1:13:33.826 --> 1:13:37.830
In other countries,
people hug each other all the time--

1:13:37.913 --> 1:13:38.956
We're dating.

1:13:39.039 --> 1:13:40.582
-My gosh.
-Ms. Dentist.

1:13:40.666 --> 1:13:42.751
-No way.
-I don't want to hide it anymore.

1:13:43.502 --> 1:13:44.837
I don't want any secrets.

1:13:45.879 --> 1:13:48.674
I want to love you openly.

1:13:51.218 --> 1:13:53.470
We're officially in a relationship.

1:13:53.554 --> 1:13:55.556
-Goodness.
-We know.

1:13:57.391 --> 1:13:58.225
Pardon?

1:13:58.308 --> 1:14:00.853
-What?
-It's been four days, right?

1:14:00.936 --> 1:14:03.730
No. It's been three days.

1:14:06.483 --> 1:14:09.069
Let me wipe it off.

1:14:09.153 --> 1:14:11.405
-Okay.
-Here? You're adorable.

1:14:11.488 --> 1:14:12.698
It's all over your face.

1:14:12.781 --> 1:14:14.408
I should give freebies to Ms. Yoon.

1:14:14.491 --> 1:14:16.034
Why aren't you eating?

1:14:16.118 --> 1:14:18.829
I want to see you a bit longer.

1:14:18.912 --> 1:14:22.291
I'm sorry about earlier. It must've hurt.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:24.918
-It was this side.
-This side?

1:14:25.752 --> 1:14:26.962
Let me blow the pain away.

1:14:27.045 --> 1:14:29.256
-Cheer up.
-Bye.

1:14:30.924 --> 1:14:33.677
Gosh, Du-sik left his phone here.

1:14:35.596 --> 1:14:36.597
What?

1:14:37.181 --> 1:14:39.558
<i>I'm sorry. Here's a heart.</i>

1:14:39.641 --> 1:14:40.767
-A heart?
-A heart?

1:14:40.851 --> 1:14:43.228
See? I told you so.

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:46.231
They tried so hard
to keep their relationship a secret.

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:48.692
Should we just tell them
that we know everything?

1:14:48.775 --> 1:14:51.862
Of course not.
We should make them tell us first.

1:14:51.945 --> 1:14:53.655
How? Any ideas?

1:14:54.448 --> 1:14:55.449
Well…

1:14:56.366 --> 1:14:57.910
-What?
-What is it?

1:14:57.993 --> 1:15:00.329
Let's make them miss each other terribly.

1:15:00.412 --> 1:15:02.039
They're head over heels right now.

1:15:02.122 --> 1:15:04.082
They'll become desperate
if they can't meet.

1:15:04.166 --> 1:15:06.752
The desperation will make their love grow.

1:15:06.835 --> 1:15:09.087
-Goodness.
-You're a genius.

1:15:09.171 --> 1:15:11.798
Should we make them pine for each other?

1:15:13.717 --> 1:15:14.718
Shall we?

1:15:14.801 --> 1:15:15.928
Gosh.

1:15:16.929 --> 1:15:17.888
Hold on.

1:15:19.515 --> 1:15:20.641
Let's go.

1:15:21.892 --> 1:15:23.435
You left this.

1:15:23.519 --> 1:15:26.480
You should've taken better care
of your belongings.

1:15:26.563 --> 1:15:27.940
You little…

1:15:29.441 --> 1:15:31.485
You and I are going to have a talk later.

1:15:31.568 --> 1:15:35.322
No. I have a family to take care of.

1:15:36.573 --> 1:15:40.369
Mi-seon, why are you so quiet?
What are you doing there?

1:15:40.452 --> 1:15:43.247
I had no idea. I just tagged along.

1:15:43.330 --> 1:15:44.373
Did you see that?

1:15:44.456 --> 1:15:48.210
I kept it a secret
despite knowing everything.

1:15:48.293 --> 1:15:50.879
I'm a woman of her word.

1:15:51.630 --> 1:15:52.631
I'm glad you did.

1:15:52.714 --> 1:15:55.133
Things worked out for them
because you stayed quiet.

1:15:55.217 --> 1:15:56.802
Chief Hong, congratulations.

1:15:56.885 --> 1:16:00.097
Anyway, how did you
end up falling for each other?

1:16:00.180 --> 1:16:02.849
Ms. Yoon, congratulations.

1:16:03.642 --> 1:16:05.602
I'm glad.

1:16:05.686 --> 1:16:07.896
I truly am.

1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:11.525
I have nothing more to wish for.

1:16:11.608 --> 1:16:12.568
Goodness!

1:16:14.611 --> 1:16:15.904
This is great.

1:16:15.988 --> 1:16:19.283
All right, then.
Thank you very much, you guys.

1:16:20.158 --> 1:16:23.787
Now that we have your support,

1:16:25.247 --> 1:16:26.832
we'll love each other openly.

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:29.793
That's great, Du-sik!

1:16:29.876 --> 1:16:32.337
Are you guys holding hands?

1:16:32.421 --> 1:16:34.548
Aren't they embarrassed
to do that in public?

1:16:34.631 --> 1:16:37.384
What's wrong with that? It's sweet.

1:16:37.467 --> 1:16:38.468
I want to vomit again.

1:16:38.552 --> 1:16:39.720
-Goodness.
-Hey.

1:16:40.512 --> 1:16:43.974
How did you manage
to keep it a secret all this time?

1:16:44.558 --> 1:16:46.435
Now that you all know,

1:16:47.227 --> 1:16:48.645
please don't get in our way.

1:16:49.563 --> 1:16:52.482
-We won't.
-She's so daring.

1:17:34.274 --> 1:17:36.401
I can't believe this was him.

1:18:03.428 --> 1:18:07.974
<i>Today, the star princess
met the sea prince.</i>

1:18:09.393 --> 1:18:13.939
<i>The princess was crying,
but the prince made her laugh.</i>

1:18:14.439 --> 1:18:19.319
<i>I hope she returns to the beach
and meets him once again.</i>

1:18:20.821 --> 1:18:25.158
<i>Gosh, Hye-jin. Your taste in men</i>

1:18:25.242 --> 1:18:27.035
hasn't changed at all.

1:18:28.078 --> 1:18:29.204
A prince?

1:18:41.466 --> 1:18:44.261
Our first day as a couple.

1:18:51.810 --> 1:18:53.729
This looks too simple.

1:18:55.355 --> 1:18:56.481
Let's see.

1:20:01.922 --> 1:20:02.839
Ta-da.

1:20:02.923 --> 1:20:04.633
-What's this?
<i>-A bucket list.</i>

1:20:04.716 --> 1:20:06.343
-Isn't this romantic?
-How so?

1:20:07.010 --> 1:20:07.844
Yippy.

1:20:07.928 --> 1:20:09.262
Go wash up.

1:20:09.763 --> 1:20:10.972
Wash up?

1:20:11.765 --> 1:20:14.267
Look out for Seong-hyeon
when you see him today.

1:20:14.351 --> 1:20:15.602
<i>Give him a drumstick.</i>

1:20:15.685 --> 1:20:16.520
<i>Here's the drumstick
I've been looking for.</i>

1:20:16.603 --> 1:20:18.855
<i>Hye-jin was worried about you.</i>

1:20:18.939 --> 1:20:20.899
She said that you looked gaunt.

1:20:20.982 --> 1:20:23.485
How can you give up
because I pretended not to notice?

1:20:23.568 --> 1:20:24.444
Mi-seon!

1:20:24.528 --> 1:20:27.197
At times I can be a bit slow.

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:29.074
Hey. Do you know how worried I was?

1:20:29.157 --> 1:20:32.285
<i>I had no way of contacting you.</i>

1:20:32.369 --> 1:20:34.162
Chief Hong. Hey!

1:20:35.372 --> 1:20:36.248
Sorry.

1:20:37.916 --> 1:20:42.921
