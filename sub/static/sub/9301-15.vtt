WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:33.365 --> 01:37.392
Move back, Move back,
make way for the carnival.

01:39.471 --> 01:41.996
Wow, I'm really excited!

01:42.207 --> 01:44.937
Me too, Orko.
It's going to be some carnival.

01:45.978 --> 01:48.708
Look what's coming!

01:59.424 --> 02:02.120
Go on, step up and have a look.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.727
Is s-she talking to me?

02:18.510 --> 02:20.637
Hey, she seems to really like
you, Cringer...

02:20.879 --> 02:22.710
too bad she has to be in the cage.

02:23.649 --> 02:27.346
I wonder what she's doing, after the show?

02:41.233 --> 02:42.598
Well, Beast Man...

02:42.768 --> 02:46.135
Have you captured
Prince Adam's overgrown pet yet?

02:47.539 --> 02:50.406
Not yet, Skeletor, but I...

02:50.576 --> 02:52.635
But what about your
power to control animals?

02:52.811 --> 02:54.438
Use it on that creature.

02:54.713 --> 02:56.613
I tried, Skeletor...

02:57.482 --> 03:00.246
There's something different
about this animal.

03:02.187 --> 03:06.453
But don't worry, Pretty Kitty has
already captured his interest.

03:06.692 --> 03:08.284
I will not fail.

03:08.594 --> 03:11.028
You better not, fur-brain.

03:11.396 --> 03:14.388
Once I have his pet,
then Prince Adam will follow...

03:14.933 --> 03:16.230
and when I have him,

03:16.401 --> 03:18.096
He-Man will come to their rescue...

03:18.670 --> 03:21.468
and, you will have him.

03:21.673 --> 03:23.903
Exactly.

03:29.247 --> 03:31.511
Look, the Human Electrode!

03:32.985 --> 03:36.113
Wow, that's the guy who can
create electricity with his hands.

03:38.724 --> 03:40.248
Pretty hot stuff!

03:40.525 --> 03:42.152
I could do that. Watch!

03:42.361 --> 03:44.852
It looks dangerous, Orko.
You might catch fire.

03:46.231 --> 03:47.664
This black powder will help me.

03:47.866 --> 03:50.801
It's ancient magic from the planet
Earth, called 'pepper'.

03:53.672 --> 03:55.333
How about letting me try?

03:58.477 --> 04:00.877
Yikes! That magic pepper better work.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.479
It didn't put it out.

04:17.396 --> 04:19.261
That was some trick.

04:19.331 --> 04:20.992
This pepper is worthless.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.329
Maybe you just weren't using it right.

04:23.335 --> 04:26.862
Nah, it's just no good. You can have it.

04:26.939 --> 04:27.940
Hurry hurry hurry...

04:28.240 --> 04:32.677
It's showtime! Yesiree.
At the beastly menagerie.

04:35.881 --> 04:37.405
And now...

04:37.983 --> 04:41.680
can beauty tame, the savage beast?

04:48.560 --> 04:49.584
Father, no!

04:56.101 --> 04:59.264
Good boy, you know I'm your friend.

04:59.905 --> 05:03.238
So please, put me down, okay?

05:07.913 --> 05:09.399
Another trick like that, and I'll

05:09.424 --> 05:10.997
have you banished from the kingdom.

05:11.783 --> 05:13.683
As you wish, sir.

05:13.985 --> 05:18.752
And now,
the most fearsome beastie of all...

05:18.957 --> 05:20.424
Pretty Kitty.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.423
Down, boy!

05:29.735 --> 05:34.832
A loving creature,
if you know how to tame her, if not...

05:42.714 --> 05:45.547
Would anyone care to pet the charming lady?

05:54.626 --> 05:56.150
Let's go, Cringer.

06:03.301 --> 06:08.830
Tonight you will pay your new
friend, a special visit.

06:34.566 --> 06:37.228
A-Adam's not gonna like this,

06:38.503 --> 06:41.438
and I'm not gonna like this.

06:48.780 --> 06:51.408
Nothing like a little evening swim.

06:58.456 --> 07:03.223
Why, Pretty Kitty,
you've brought your friend back.

07:05.063 --> 07:08.362
I see you've taken quite a liking to her.

07:09.701 --> 07:13.865
Why don't you, join her in the cage?

07:20.946 --> 07:22.470
Welcome...

07:23.648 --> 07:25.616
to the carnival.

07:29.688 --> 07:32.987
It's? It's... B-B-B-Beast Man!

07:34.993 --> 07:38.793
Next stop: Snake Mountain!

07:40.331 --> 07:45.132
[stuttering]
I hope Skeletor likes carnivals...

07:46.471 --> 07:49.770
Cringer, Cringer, Cringer!

07:51.743 --> 07:54.610
The cook said he didn't
show up for breakfast either.

07:54.646 --> 07:57.843
Cringer has never missed a
meal in his life. He's gone...

07:58.116 --> 08:00.812
and so's the carnival, a day early.

08:01.186 --> 08:02.676
I don't like this, Adam.

08:02.954 --> 08:04.178
Adam, Man-At-Arms...

08:04.522 --> 08:07.218
[Orko flies in] One of Teela's guards,

08:07.425 --> 08:08.822
found a message from Skeletor

08:09.410 --> 08:10.571
He has Cringer.

08:10.595 --> 08:13.962
He wants you to come to
Snake Mountain to get him.

08:16.167 --> 08:17.930
I'm going to get him back!

08:18.136 --> 08:19.034
It's a trap...

08:19.537 --> 08:22.870
Skeletor wants to capture you
as bait, to draw He-Man.

08:23.775 --> 08:26.403
By the power of Grayskull.

08:32.484 --> 08:36.477
I have the power!

08:39.658 --> 08:41.826
If it's He-Man Skeletor wants...

08:41.826 --> 08:43.384
it's He-Man he'll get.

08:50.402 --> 08:55.169
Sounds like we have company.
Prince Adam, no doubt.

08:59.010 --> 09:02.571
He-Man! He's come after
the creature himself.

09:04.282 --> 09:07.615
Our plan's working better
than we thought.

09:07.852 --> 09:11.049
My plan, Fur-face. Don't you forget it.

09:11.422 --> 09:13.856
Is it time to show him,
Prince Adam's tiger?

09:14.092 --> 09:16.686
Not yet. I want him closer...

09:17.662 --> 09:20.529
then we will spring our trap.

09:23.668 --> 09:24.828
And you mean to tell me...

09:25.103 --> 09:28.095
Adam went after Cringer by himself?

09:28.873 --> 09:31.171
Honest, Teela, he'll be all right.

09:31.409 --> 09:33.036
Someone has to go after him.

09:33.378 --> 09:35.010
I don't know if it's such a good idea.

09:35.514 --> 09:36.514
He wanted to go alone.

09:37.214 --> 09:38.214
Orko!

09:38.215 --> 09:41.116
It is my sworn duty to
protect Prince Adam...

09:41.152 --> 09:42.617
and that's what I intend to do.

09:44.789 --> 09:46.256
Be careful, Teela.

09:51.261 --> 09:55.254
Let's make sure our little
trap is ready for He-Man.

09:55.332 --> 09:56.356
He-Man will see the animal...

09:56.433 --> 09:59.527
and will walk this way to climb up to him..

09:59.604 --> 10:04.569
and when he does, he will fall
into the pit and meet Octabeast.

10:20.925 --> 10:24.452
Now is the time.
Release the Shadow Beast.

10:38.043 --> 10:39.772
We've got him now.

10:40.144 --> 10:43.170
The Shadow Beast will
imprison He-Man in the cave.

10:49.187 --> 10:50.279
Remember me?

10:50.488 --> 10:51.750
-Teela! -Don't worry...

10:51.990 --> 10:55.153
the Shadow Beast and I are old friends.
Right, fella?

10:58.296 --> 10:59.388
That's it.

10:59.664 --> 11:03.191
Just put my friend down. He won't hurt you.

11:03.435 --> 11:04.435
Good boy!

11:05.236 --> 11:07.295
Thanks, Teela. What are you doing here?

11:07.538 --> 11:08.197
Same as you.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.403
Looking for Prince Adam and Cringer.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.467
Cringer must be up there.

11:14.912 --> 11:15.970
I'll get him.

11:16.514 --> 11:18.482
I'll wait here in case Adam shows up.

11:18.850 --> 11:20.875
And to keep your friend, calm.

11:25.589 --> 11:27.523
Look, He-Man's still coming.

11:27.692 --> 11:30.024
How did he defeat
the Shadow Beast?

11:30.995 --> 11:31.962
No matter.

11:32.063 --> 11:34.827
He's approaching the
final trap with Octabeast.

11:41.306 --> 11:44.207
Cringer, there you are!

11:46.244 --> 11:48.007
Calm down, I'll be right up.

11:48.646 --> 11:53.140
H-H-He-Man. Be careful, it's a... a trap!

11:54.519 --> 11:56.544
He can't hear me.

11:56.821 --> 11:59.016
Don't worry, Cringer. I'll get you out.

12:03.361 --> 12:07.229
Only one more step,
and He-Man will fall into the pit.

12:07.498 --> 12:10.763
There's only one way to save He-Man now.

12:15.239 --> 12:16.467
Cringer!  Noo!

12:27.618 --> 12:29.609
That creature saved him.

12:30.555 --> 12:33.456
It's all your fault, you flea bag.

12:33.524 --> 12:34.957
I'll have your hide for this.

12:40.131 --> 12:43.931
Cringer, why on Eternia
did you jump like that?

12:44.268 --> 12:47.066
There was no other
way to warn you...

12:47.305 --> 12:49.637
You would step into a trap.

12:49.907 --> 12:51.875
You risked your life to warn me.

12:53.044 --> 12:57.743
Oh-oh-oh. I did, didn't I?
I wonder what came over me?

12:58.116 --> 12:59.947
Well, I think it's called 'courage'.

13:00.018 --> 13:01.018
Thanks, Cringer.

13:01.819 --> 13:05.277
As long as we're here,
let's pay Skeletor, a visit.

13:06.224 --> 13:08.924
Oh, co-co-come on, He-Man,

13:09.460 --> 13:12.293
haven't been through enough for one day?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.760
You'll feel better after this.

13:34.719 --> 13:38.450
I can't wait to get my
paws on that boney creep!

13:42.360 --> 13:46.660
But, Skeletor, it wasn't my fault.

13:47.131 --> 13:49.395
I did everything you told me...

13:51.436 --> 13:53.233
Skeletor, the alarm!

13:53.337 --> 13:55.601
Someone else is on Snake Mountain.

13:59.510 --> 14:03.002
It's Teela, Head of the Royal Guard.

14:04.816 --> 14:07.808
We may have some new bait for He-Man.

14:09.687 --> 14:10.984
He-Man !

14:14.725 --> 14:16.386
He-Man, help!

14:19.564 --> 14:22.397
Oh no!  He-Man!

14:25.670 --> 14:26.932
Excellent!

14:28.039 --> 14:30.974
Beast Man, communicate with Octabeast.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.539
Have him bring the woman
to the south entrance.

14:34.212 --> 14:36.772
He-Man won't leave without her.

14:39.684 --> 14:41.777
Let me go, you overgrown chimp!

14:42.987 --> 14:44.887
And spoil our fun?

14:45.890 --> 14:48.984
Hurry up, He-Man will be coming soon.

14:49.193 --> 14:51.218
Don't worry, we'll be ready.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.095
I've energized the chains.

14:58.336 --> 15:01.567
They're so strong,
not even He-Man can break them.

15:01.839 --> 15:02.897
You witch!

15:03.174 --> 15:04.903
Why, thank you.

15:13.818 --> 15:15.073
We made it, Cat.

15:15.098 --> 15:16.902
Atop, Snake Mountain.

15:17.021 --> 15:18.613
Now, let's let's find Skeletor.

15:31.035 --> 15:33.765
Going somewhere, He-Man?

15:40.177 --> 15:42.111
You've been working too hard, Beast Man.

15:42.313 --> 15:45.214
A little trip will do you good.

15:48.052 --> 15:51.021
No!  Put me down!

15:52.490 --> 15:53.923
If you insist.

15:56.527 --> 15:59.587
Argh, argh.

15:59.864 --> 16:02.799
The walls are still spinning.

16:09.540 --> 16:13.670
Let's see how you like
being in a glass cage.

16:19.617 --> 16:22.051
Enjoy the view in there, Beast Man?

16:24.021 --> 16:26.080
Let me out of here.

16:26.657 --> 16:29.922
When I get my claws on you...

16:32.063 --> 16:35.055
We'll come back for him later.
Now for Skeletor.

16:35.299 --> 16:36.732
Not so fast, He-Man.

16:36.968 --> 16:39.459
Just because you defeated
that fur-brained fool,

16:40.204 --> 16:42.172
don't think you'll get past me.

16:54.085 --> 16:55.085
Battle cat!

16:56.687 --> 16:58.778
No, put me down.

17:01.225 --> 17:02.920
Let me out.

17:03.361 --> 17:05.829
Not yet, but here's a visitor.

17:06.430 --> 17:09.160
Unhand me, you big cat.

17:10.434 --> 17:13.164
Beast Man, this is all your fault.

17:13.637 --> 17:16.867
My fault? You're the one,

17:16.941 --> 17:20.172
who said...
Beast Man, this is all your fault!

17:21.512 --> 17:22.877
Two down.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.843
And Skeletor yet to come.

17:30.054 --> 17:31.681
Welcome, He-Man.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.425
You said you wanted to talk.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.418
Of course, He-Man.

17:37.662 --> 17:41.689
Just as soon as you escort me
to Castle Grayskull.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.328
Never! Give me that Magic Staff of yours.

17:55.212 --> 17:56.201
Mirrors!

17:56.414 --> 17:58.644
Only one is really me.

17:58.849 --> 18:00.749
Which one is it, He-Man?

18:04.355 --> 18:09.349
The walls are closing in.
Now take me to Grayskull.

18:13.130 --> 18:17.066
Even you can't hold them apart for
long, He-Man.

18:21.272 --> 18:26.175
You tiring already.
Soon you will take me to Grayskull.

18:29.980 --> 18:31.311
Orko's pepper!

18:51.335 --> 18:52.962
No!  Keep away.

18:54.638 --> 18:57.232
You'll pay for this, He-Man.

18:58.609 --> 18:59.974
Now let's find Teela.

19:03.848 --> 19:06.373
He-Man, I knew you'd find me.

19:06.684 --> 19:08.044
We would have been here sooner...

19:08.185 --> 19:10.551
but Battle Cat and I
had some unfinished business.

19:11.188 --> 19:12.746
Evil-Lyn energized the chains.

19:12.957 --> 19:14.754
She said you won't be able to break them.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.017
We'll see about that.

19:18.529 --> 19:21.225
Thanks. I've had enough of Snake Mountain.

19:21.866 --> 19:23.925
Let's find Adam and Cringer and go home.

19:24.135 --> 19:26.501
Ah, I'll see that they
get back to the palace.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.838
Besides, there's something else you can do.

19:29.073 --> 19:32.201
I have Beast Man and Evil-Lyn
locked up inside the cave.

19:32.476 --> 19:36.105
Hm, don't worry. I'll see that
they'll get what's coming to them

19:36.313 --> 19:38.042
in an Eternian court of law.

19:38.249 --> 19:39.716
I was hoping you'd say that.

19:41.152 --> 19:44.610
And then He-Man promised to return
Prince Adam and Cringer to the palace.

19:45.790 --> 19:47.280
... and that's the story.

19:47.525 --> 19:50.858
Orko, I gave this to He-Man
and he said give it back to you.

19:51.162 --> 19:54.222
See I told you?
Nobody wants it because it doesn't work.

19:54.598 --> 19:55.826
On the contrary.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.660
He-Man said it saved the day.

19:58.235 --> 20:01.136
Huh? It caused uncontrollable sneezing.

20:01.472 --> 20:03.838
Sneezing? Let's have a look here.

20:04.108 --> 20:06.133
Uh, I don't think you want to open that.

20:06.443 --> 20:07.910
Hey, I'm a magician.

20:08.212 --> 20:11.181
This stuff won't work on me.
Besides, I...

20:25.963 --> 20:27.521
HAHAHAHAHAHA.

20:32.736 --> 20:35.534
Today I want to talk to you about courage.

20:35.940 --> 20:39.501
Now courage not only means being
brave in the face of danger,

20:39.777 --> 20:42.007
it also means having
the strength to say 'no'

20:42.146 --> 20:46.048
when your friends are trying to talk you
into doing something you know is wrong.

20:46.717 --> 20:47.547
In short,

20:47.918 --> 20:52.082
courage means having principles
and sticking to them,

20:52.489 --> 20:53.786
no matter what.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.781
See you all again soon.
