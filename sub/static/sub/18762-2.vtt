Oh, Christ, does every single
one of these kids have the flu?

00:15.464 --> 00:16.197
Seems like it.

00:16.235 --> 00:18.168
All right, now I bet you guys
are wondering what's going on

00:18.204 --> 00:20.203
- with this racing suit, huh?
- No, not even a little bit.

00:20.238 --> 00:21.672
You're like,
"What's that rascal Charlie up to?"

00:21.705 --> 00:23.705
"What's he up to this time?"
Right, right?

00:23.741 --> 00:24.805
- I'm not thinking that at all.
- Yeah, yeah, well,

00:24.842 --> 00:26.973
it's an issue of aerodynamics, really.

00:27.010 --> 00:28.411
You see, every second counts
in the water park.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.037
- Right.
- And we plan to ride

00:30.037 --> 00:31.376
- every single ride in there today.
- Yup.

00:31.410 --> 00:32.977
Yeah, the brochure says three days.

00:33.013 --> 00:33.979
We're saying bullshit to that.

00:34.013 --> 00:35.379
- We're gonna get it done in one.
- One day.

00:35.413 --> 00:37.112
All right, well, good luck
with that 'cause you got, like,

00:37.149 --> 00:38.783
ten minutes of clean water and
then every slide's basically

00:38.815 --> 00:40.148
a urine delivery system.

00:40.184 --> 00:41.382
- Yeah.
- We're not gonna get

00:41.416 --> 00:42.816
- drenched in piss.
- No.

00:42.852 --> 00:44.452
We're gonna go in there,
find our favorite ride,

00:44.486 --> 00:45.986
- bomb down it once,
- Yeah.

00:46.021 --> 00:48.488
then sit by the pool the
rest of the day disease-free.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.820
Don't kid yourself about the water,
buddy.

00:49.856 --> 00:50.821
You're not gonna be disease-free;

00:50.856 --> 00:51.954
this water's already infested

00:51.990 --> 00:53.189
with every parasite on the planet.

00:53.225 --> 00:54.491
And I, for one, have no intention

00:54.526 --> 00:55.826
of stepping foot in any of it.

00:55.859 --> 00:57.359
So what do you come to a water park for?

00:57.394 --> 01:00.627
Hot food, cold beer,
bikini'd women seeking relief

01:00.663 --> 01:02.529
from the insufferable
prison of motherhood.

01:02.564 --> 01:04.030
Yeah, lot of pleasures to
be had at the park, Frank.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.664
- None of which involve piss.
- Hmm.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.497
And it's all free, too,
if you know how to get it.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.133
Well, it's not free,
you got to pay to get in.

01:09.168 --> 01:11.534
Not me, I had my bracelet
laminated in the '90s.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.502
I haven't paid to get
in here since I was 14.

01:13.538 --> 01:15.028
- Nice!
- Nice, nice.

01:15.029 --> 01:16.870
- Oh, smart.
- Oh, shush! Shush, shush, shush, shush,

01:16.870 --> 01:18.372
- they're about to open!
- Why do we have to shush?

01:18.407 --> 01:19.907
Oh, guys! I almost forgot.

01:19.942 --> 01:21.708
Do not go near the pool drains,

01:21.741 --> 01:24.139
no matter how good you might
think they feel on your butt.

01:24.175 --> 01:25.742
- What? - Huh?
- What?

01:25.779 --> 01:27.212
You do not sit on those!

01:27.246 --> 01:28.845
You know, because of the suction
on your butthole?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.413
No one's thinking about that, man.

01:30.445 --> 01:31.712
No one's thinking about that at all.

01:31.748 --> 01:33.746
Oh, good, 'cause it is bad news.

01:33.782 --> 01:35.847
Those things will suck the
intestines right out of you.

01:35.885 --> 01:38.216
Like it did to that one kid back in '96.

01:38.252 --> 01:39.819
Now, she had to chew
through her intestines

01:39.853 --> 01:41.318
- just to get free.
- When I see the drain,

01:41.353 --> 01:42.720
I'm not gonna go try and sit on it.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.086
- Oh, here we go.
- Okay, here we go! Here we go!

01:44.121 --> 01:45.886
We got to go! Get in there!

01:45.922 --> 01:47.656
- Go! Go! Go!
- Christ!

Here we go, here we go, here we go!

02:17.616 --> 02:20.350
- Yeah, Kiddie Twister!
- I'm so excited.

02:20.383 --> 02:22.582
- It's been, like, 20 years.
- What's that?

02:22.618 --> 02:24.051
Uh, it's a urine tester.

02:24.085 --> 02:25.617
Just want to be 100% sure.

02:25.653 --> 02:28.052
It turns light red at the
slightest hint of piss.

02:28.087 --> 02:30.452
- And I think we're good.
- Let's roll.

02:30.488 --> 02:31.722
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

02:31.755 --> 02:33.029
Slide's for kids only.

02:33.385 --> 02:34.675
Size requirement.

02:34.898 --> 02:36.132
Shut up, nerd!

02:37.733 --> 02:39.798
Kiddie Twister!

02:41.337 --> 02:42.936
Screw you, nerd!

02:42.970 --> 02:43.935
You're gonna get hurt

02:43.971 --> 02:45.537
Uh, come on, nerd.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.773
Whoo-hoo! Kiddie Twister!

02:48.808 --> 02:50.972
I don't give a shit.

02:51.010 --> 02:52.876
<i>Kiddie Twister!</i>

02:54.544 --> 02:56.844
Kiddie Twis... Oh, shit!

02:56.880 --> 02:59.178
- Kiddie Twister!
- Wait, Dee, no!

02:59.213 --> 03:01.046
No, I'm stuck, wait!

03:01.082 --> 03:03.147
<i>Ow!</i>

03:03.184 --> 03:04.064
Shit!

03:04.483 --> 03:05.983
Ow! Ow, Dee, I'm stuck!

03:06.018 --> 03:07.384
Yeah, no shit!

03:07.417 --> 03:09.117
- Dee, you got to move.
- Me move? You move.

03:09.153 --> 03:10.818
You're blocking me.

03:10.853 --> 03:13.118
Your stupid wrist band
got us all jammed up.

03:13.155 --> 03:14.291
It's not just that.

03:14.822 --> 03:17.489
The slide's too small,
the nerd was right.

03:17.523 --> 03:19.356
Shit, what are we gonna do?

03:19.392 --> 03:21.490
Uh... okay. Just remain calm, all right?

03:21.526 --> 03:23.226
Do not panic,
that's the worst thing you can do.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.061
Okay, but we got to get unstuck
before they send another kid

03:25.096 --> 03:26.895
because... oh, God,

03:26.929 --> 03:28.895
some big, fat kid's just gonna
come blasting down on us.

03:28.931 --> 03:30.589
You're gonna be fine. Trust me.

03:31.865 --> 03:33.698
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!

03:33.734 --> 03:35.035
Jesus Christ!

03:36.435 --> 03:37.668
This is slow, Charlie.

03:37.703 --> 03:39.203
I'm never gonna get through this crap.

03:39.237 --> 03:41.424
We should've gone down
the first slide we saw.

03:41.424 --> 03:43.815
I know, I know, but we needed
to start at the northmost point

03:43.815 --> 03:44.562
of the park, right?

03:44.562 --> 03:45.579
- Then we work our way south,
- Yeah.

03:45.579 --> 03:47.020
and that cuts back on the excess

03:47.020 --> 03:49.028
- running back and forth.
- Oh, yeah.

03:49.028 --> 03:50.511
You know, that said,
I'm sorry I got us so lost.

03:50.511 --> 03:53.210
I can't ever tell which
way is north on a map.

03:53.244 --> 03:54.811
It's at the top.

03:54.847 --> 03:57.213
- I thought north was, like, up.
- "Up"?

03:57.249 --> 03:59.314
Yeah, like if I turn the map this way,
now where is north?

03:59.348 --> 04:00.982
- Still at the top of the... no.
- Down?

04:01.017 --> 04:03.382
- Now, come on, Charlie, this is ridiculous.
- It's confusing, right?

04:03.418 --> 04:04.818
We got to get going here.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.752
- I know, goddamn it.
- Where's he going?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.821
- Coming through. Excuse us.
- What, what?

04:08.853 --> 04:10.353
How come he can cut to the front?

04:10.389 --> 04:12.022
Oh, Ethan is here with a special program

04:12.058 --> 04:13.358
for children with leukemia,

04:13.390 --> 04:15.822
so he skips to the front of the line.

04:15.858 --> 04:17.656
Thank you! Coming through.

04:19.361 --> 04:21.094
AIDS!

04:21.127 --> 04:23.192
AIDS, I got AIDS.
I got AIDS, we're coming through.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.327
- Yeah, yeah, sorry.
- Cutting through.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.729
I'm his doctor, my patient's got to get

04:26.729 --> 04:27.849
- to the front of the line
- Yeah.

04:27.884 --> 04:29.264
- Because he has AIDS.
- I got the AIDS.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.332
He got it from a gay guy in the '80s.

04:31.368 --> 04:32.567
- I'm not gay, I didn't... but...
- Well...

04:32.603 --> 04:34.168
There's two kind of AIDS...

04:34.202 --> 04:36.202
there's the vagina AIDS and
then the needle-based AIDS.

04:36.238 --> 04:38.104
I-I'm a vagina guy.

04:38.139 --> 04:40.171
- Well, no, actually my test results show
- I got... sorry, I'm... AIDS.

04:40.207 --> 04:41.406
that it was the gay AIDS.

04:41.442 --> 04:42.742
- All AIDS are bad.
- Well...

04:42.774 --> 04:44.007
That's... no good AIDS.

04:44.043 --> 04:45.675
But I'm telling you, like I said,

04:45.709 --> 04:47.175
this is not the gay AIDS.

04:58.082 --> 04:59.748
Lie back down.

05:05.454 --> 05:07.752
One of these little stinkers yours?

05:07.788 --> 05:09.022
My son.

05:09.057 --> 05:10.255
This one here?

05:10.289 --> 05:12.753
Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah, he's adorable.

05:12.959 --> 05:13.923
You?

05:13.959 --> 05:15.925
Oh, daughter, yeah.

05:15.962 --> 05:18.060
I try to take her to
fun places like this.

05:18.096 --> 05:19.729
Let a little sunshine back into her life

05:19.762 --> 05:21.428
ever since her mom...

05:22.966 --> 05:25.365
Oh, my God. Did she...

05:25.401 --> 05:27.234
Die horrifically?

05:27.267 --> 05:28.566
Yeah.

05:28.601 --> 05:30.201
Drowning. Kind of ironic,

05:30.236 --> 05:31.368
us being at a water park,

05:31.402 --> 05:33.036
but, you know, you got to...

05:33.072 --> 05:34.904
you got to roll with the punches,
you know?

05:34.937 --> 05:36.538
Got to get back out
there and live life...

05:36.574 --> 05:38.873
Daddy, Daddy, can I borrow $20?

05:38.909 --> 05:40.106
What?

05:40.142 --> 05:42.075
Oh, hi there, what's your name?

05:42.108 --> 05:43.308
Abby.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.576
I'm hungry, Daddy.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.410
Can I please have $20?

05:48.014 --> 05:49.547
Well, I think you can get
something to eat

05:49.579 --> 05:51.279
for a lot less than that, hon.

05:51.315 --> 05:52.615
Dad!

05:52.651 --> 05:54.117
I'm hungry, I'm starving,

05:54.149 --> 05:56.248
and you haven't given me any money.

05:58.222 --> 05:59.619
Yeah.

05:59.654 --> 06:00.887
What the hell?

06:02.123 --> 06:04.454
Anything for my little...

06:04.488 --> 06:05.405
Abby.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.994
Interesting.

06:14.430 --> 06:16.396
What's interesting?

06:16.428 --> 06:18.062
Nothing.

06:18.099 --> 06:19.296
I'm done with you.

06:19.332 --> 06:20.599
Keep up.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.958
- Aah! Jesus.
- You'd think all the pressure

06:26.958 --> 06:27.987
would blast us through.

06:28.023 --> 06:30.455
No, it's just squeezing
me further into the stuck!

06:30.491 --> 06:31.957
Okay, well, get-get the bracelet off.

06:31.989 --> 06:33.788
- Just rip it off.
- Dee, I'm trying.

06:33.823 --> 06:35.624
I can't get any actual leverage on it.

06:35.660 --> 06:36.892
Besides, it's triple-laminated.

06:36.926 --> 06:38.226
- It's not just gonna rip.
- Oh, no.

06:38.261 --> 06:39.628
- I think someone peed.
- What?!

06:39.660 --> 06:40.893
Sherman, did you pee?

06:40.927 --> 06:42.627
- No.
- Sherman, my vial

06:42.664 --> 06:44.063
- is turning light pink.
- Ugh...

06:44.097 --> 06:46.597
goddamn it, Sherman,
I ordered you not to pee!

06:46.631 --> 06:48.564
- Sorry!
- Oh, disgusting!

06:48.600 --> 06:49.899
Sorry's not gonna cut it, Sherman,

06:49.934 --> 06:51.334
- it's not gonna cut it.
- Nobody else pee!

06:51.369 --> 06:52.602
Ah, the sun's just blasting me

06:52.636 --> 06:53.835
right in the face.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.237
Why does it have to be right there?

06:55.270 --> 06:57.270
Dee, if God put the sun there,

06:57.306 --> 06:58.840
there's probably a reason, okay?

06:58.873 --> 07:00.339
Don't question him; we need God!

07:00.374 --> 07:02.340
God didn't put the sun anywhere.

07:02.376 --> 07:04.977
The sun stays still;
the Earth moves around it.

07:06.477 --> 07:07.910
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Okay. All right.

07:07.943 --> 07:09.943
We gotta get these kids out of here.

07:09.979 --> 07:11.912
All right. I'm going for it.
I'm just pulling on one of 'em.

07:11.948 --> 07:15.015
Come on. Ah, this friggin'
dome's like a magnifying glass.

07:16.350 --> 07:18.116
Get him through, I can get him.

07:19.785 --> 07:21.849
- Get help.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:21.888 --> 07:23.854
Kid, kid, kid, listen. Come here.

07:23.886 --> 07:25.519
Before you go,

07:25.556 --> 07:27.821
no matter how alluring it is,

07:27.857 --> 07:29.657
do not put your genitals
or your butthole

07:29.691 --> 07:31.191
near the pool drain. You got it?

07:31.224 --> 07:32.824
- In fact, cover your butthole.
- Okay, go.

07:32.859 --> 07:34.825
- Okay, kid. Go, kid, go!
- Come on. Go.

07:34.859 --> 07:36.092
Cover that butthole, kid!

07:36.126 --> 07:37.761
Mac. Stop talking to children

07:37.797 --> 07:38.994
about their buttholes, okay?

07:39.030 --> 07:40.196
- It's not appropriate.
- Okay.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.530
Okay.

07:41.566 --> 07:42.965
Uh, I think we gotta get
another kid out.

07:42.999 --> 07:44.265
You know what?

07:44.299 --> 07:45.932
What about this one?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.465
That kid looks passed out, Dee.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.968
Yeah, he's out cold, but I think

07:49.003 --> 07:50.537
I can maneuver his body pretty easily.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.436
Yeah, but if we send him down there,
he might drown.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.306
Guys, I gotta take a poop.

08:09.881 --> 08:11.547
- I see you stealing.
- I wasn't stealing them!

08:11.583 --> 08:12.983
I just forgot I was wearing them!

08:13.016 --> 08:14.516
Let go of me!

08:14.551 --> 08:15.849
My dad's a cop!

08:15.885 --> 08:18.553
Abigail! What is going on in here?

08:18.586 --> 08:20.285
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.853
- This your daughter?
- Yes.

08:21.888 --> 08:23.455
Officer Dennis Reynolds.

08:23.489 --> 08:24.855
Hi. Off-duty, of course.

08:24.889 --> 08:26.722
This is your jurisdiction.

08:26.758 --> 08:28.158
- Look, I caught her stealing sunglasses.
- Yeah?

08:28.194 --> 08:30.026
- No, I didn't! I was just...
- Abigail,

08:30.058 --> 08:31.725
I gave you $20 to buy
whatever you wanted.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.029
What happened to that?
Do you still have it?

08:35.028 --> 08:36.561
Yes.

08:36.597 --> 08:38.697
Well, then you need to
pay for these sunglasses.

08:41.166 --> 08:42.364
Actually, no. You know what?

08:42.399 --> 08:43.865
On second thought, no.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.567
You don't get the sunglasses.

08:45.603 --> 08:47.835
- You need to be taught a lesson.
- I think that she gets...

08:47.872 --> 08:49.472
I really appreciate
everything that you do.

08:49.504 --> 08:51.803
Real police officer to security guard,

08:51.840 --> 08:53.473
honestly,
I want to thank you for everything.

08:53.507 --> 08:55.339
- Thanks.
- This little girl,

08:55.374 --> 08:56.674
she's gonna be grounded for a month.

08:56.709 --> 08:58.209
Come on, Abigail, let's go.

08:58.243 --> 09:01.210
Try to touch me, and I'll scream "rape."

09:01.245 --> 09:02.578
Please.

09:02.614 --> 09:03.913
I see the road you're headed down:

09:03.947 --> 09:05.380
the lying, the stealing, all of it.

09:05.415 --> 09:06.648
And as somebody who's
been down that road,

09:06.681 --> 09:07.914
let me tell you something:

09:08.906 --> 09:10.148
you've got real talent.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.583
Okay...

09:11.618 --> 09:13.051
Mmm.

09:13.085 --> 09:14.317
That ought to work.

09:14.351 --> 09:15.584
What are you doing?

09:15.619 --> 09:17.019
Oh, it's a simple lunch play.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.689
I tell the burger stand

09:18.721 --> 09:20.420
some hyperactive brat knocked
my food on the ground,

09:20.455 --> 09:21.922
they replace it, no questions asked.

09:21.956 --> 09:23.590
I usually just swipe a burger

09:23.624 --> 09:25.590
off some dumb-ass family
while they're not looking.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.258
Well, that begs the question, Abigail:

09:27.293 --> 09:29.928
you want to be a thief or
do you want to be an artist?

09:29.963 --> 09:31.596
You see, an artist takes whatever

09:31.628 --> 09:34.061
he wants when somebody's
looking right at him.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.266
- These are too small for me.
- Yeah.

09:40.301 --> 09:43.167
- You get the point.
- Yeah.

09:57.646 --> 09:59.612
- I got AIDS, AIDS.
- AIDS! Guy with AIDS, coming through.

09:59.646 --> 10:01.679
AIDS, coming through. AIDS, AIDS...

10:01.715 --> 10:02.937
- AIDS!
- Hey, man, go through.

10:02.937 --> 10:03.749
Hey, go for it, go, go, go!

10:03.783 --> 10:05.417
No, you need a raft! You need a raft!

10:20.725 --> 10:22.624
- Ah! Ah!
- Ow!

10:22.659 --> 10:23.685
Go.

10:25.227 --> 10:26.183
Go.

10:27.062 --> 10:28.962
- My camera!
- Oh, great, your camera.

10:28.998 --> 10:30.364
I was really worried about that.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.063
This is my watch.

10:42.437 --> 10:43.377
Go.

10:44.639 --> 10:45.576
Go.

10:46.507 --> 10:48.939
- My sunglasses.
- Oh, all of our chains!

10:48.975 --> 10:50.141
You know how hard it is
to get all of our chains.

10:50.176 --> 10:51.141
- AIDS...
- AIDS, AIDS!

10:56.580 --> 10:57.880
Ow!

10:57.916 --> 11:00.314
Stop sending kids, nerd!

11:00.350 --> 11:02.481
- You goddamn nerd!
- Go.

11:02.516 --> 11:04.150
- We're making good time.
- We're doin' it, Charlie.

11:04.186 --> 11:05.719
We're pretty much...
we're pretty much caught up.

11:05.753 --> 11:08.420
Whoa, hey, hey, guys!

11:08.452 --> 11:10.385
What are you guys doing?
You guys doing a AIDS thing?

11:10.422 --> 11:11.620
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

11:11.656 --> 11:12.955
I gave Frank a couple hickeys

11:12.989 --> 11:14.422
- to sell the lesions.
- Sucked on 'em.

11:14.455 --> 11:15.889
Yeah, yeah.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.291
You doing a fake daughter thing?

11:17.326 --> 11:19.658
- Yeah.
- Cool. All right, man, see ya.

11:19.692 --> 11:20.501
See ya.

11:41.874 --> 11:44.643
Three, two, one, go!

11:47.277 --> 11:49.143
I got AIDS!

11:51.980 --> 11:53.464
Yeah!

11:58.758 --> 12:00.324
- Frank, we did it, man!
- Charlie!

12:00.360 --> 12:01.659
- With time to spare!
- Charlie! We...

12:01.692 --> 12:03.990
- Every single ride in here!
- We won!

12:04.028 --> 12:05.394
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

12:05.428 --> 12:06.560
Hey! Suck on that, river rat!

12:06.775 --> 12:07.828
Every ride!

12:09.999 --> 12:11.197
- We did it.
- Oh, shit.

12:11.232 --> 12:13.265
Frank. Look at this!

12:15.768 --> 12:17.301
- Oh.
- Oh...

12:17.337 --> 12:18.837
What... what is that?

12:18.870 --> 12:20.668
I don't know.

12:20.703 --> 12:22.337
I mean, that-that's not on the map...
what ride is that?

12:22.372 --> 12:23.504
Excuse me?

12:23.539 --> 12:24.671
- Excuse me, ma'am?
- Yeah?

12:24.707 --> 12:26.073
What is this ride over here?

12:26.107 --> 12:27.140
Oh, that's our new slide.

12:27.175 --> 12:28.541
It's, uh, Thunder Gun Express.

12:28.576 --> 12:29.875
We just finished construction.

12:29.909 --> 12:31.376
It'll be open in a few weeks.

12:31.410 --> 12:32.375
- A Thunder Gun ride?
- Yeah.

12:32.412 --> 12:33.543
Like the movie?

12:33.577 --> 12:35.077
Yeah, but there's no water
or anything yet,

12:35.112 --> 12:36.579
- so we still have to test it.
- Oh, yeah.

12:36.612 --> 12:38.045
It's totally dry.

12:38.082 --> 12:39.414
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's not, it's not...

12:39.449 --> 12:41.547
no, but it's not, it's,
it's not open yet.

12:41.582 --> 12:42.881
It's Thunder Gun, man. No hesitation.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.716
- No, no, no.
- No surrender. No man left behind.

12:44.751 --> 12:46.251
We got to get to the top of that slide.

12:46.284 --> 12:48.818
And raw-dog the shit out of it!

12:51.422 --> 12:52.587
- Mac?
- Yeah?

12:52.622 --> 12:54.255
My vial is blood red.

12:54.292 --> 12:55.892
That's because the water's not
even running through anymore.

12:55.924 --> 12:57.391
It's just pooling up.

12:57.425 --> 12:58.991
- Well, I got to tell you something, though, I...
- Huh?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.994
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to hold it much longer.

13:01.026 --> 13:02.892
- What?!
- I-I've been in here for so long, I-I...

13:02.929 --> 13:04.728
Don't you do it, Dee! Don't you do it!

13:04.763 --> 13:06.063
The problem is it's already happening.

13:06.096 --> 13:07.529
I'm peeing on your shoulder right now.

13:07.566 --> 13:09.410
But I don't mean to, I'm sorry.

13:09.533 --> 13:10.531
- It's warm.
- You bitch!

13:10.567 --> 13:12.067
When we get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you!

13:12.101 --> 13:13.734
What am I supposed to do?
How are you even holding your pee?

13:13.769 --> 13:15.202
We've been stuck in here forever!

13:15.236 --> 13:16.837
Oh, I peed as soon
as we got in the slide.

13:16.870 --> 13:17.910
- Me, too.
- What?!

13:18.738 --> 13:20.039
- Ew!
- What?!

13:20.072 --> 13:21.372
These animals are, they're laughing!

13:21.407 --> 13:22.572
Of course they are!

13:22.607 --> 13:24.074
I think they're actually
enjoying this shit!

13:24.109 --> 13:25.240
Oh, they love every second of it!

13:25.275 --> 13:26.440
- They're just pissing all over us!
- Goddamn it.

13:26.476 --> 13:28.909
We're gonna die in here with them!

13:28.944 --> 13:30.511
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, Dee.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.577
- I've got an idea!
- What?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.079
If we can get Sherman's mouth

13:34.114 --> 13:36.212
to this bracelet,
we can get out of here.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.214
You said you couldn't rip through it.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.215
No, I can't.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.116
But Sherman can chew through it!

13:40.150 --> 13:42.116
Like the girl in the pool drain

13:42.153 --> 13:44.351
when she got her anus stuck,
she chewed through

13:44.388 --> 13:47.455
her prolapsed anus and
chewed herself to freedom.

13:47.489 --> 13:49.122
- What are you talking about?!
- Sherman!

13:49.155 --> 13:50.921
Get your mouth to this
bracelet and chew!

13:50.957 --> 13:52.055
Aw, screw it. Try it.

13:52.091 --> 13:53.358
Chew like you've never chewed before.

13:53.393 --> 13:54.793
Go, Sherman, chew!

13:59.163 --> 14:00.162
Whoa!

14:01.429 --> 14:03.262
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

14:03.298 --> 14:04.765
I got some boy to give me this.

14:04.798 --> 14:07.298
I said I'd kiss him if he
met me in the parking lot.

14:07.332 --> 14:09.966
Then I swiped his wristband,
so he can't get back in.

14:10.303 --> 14:11.066
Nice.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.967
Thanks. Well, I got to roll.

14:13.004 --> 14:14.538
What do you mean? Where you going?

14:14.571 --> 14:15.970
We're just getting started.

14:16.005 --> 14:18.438
Yeah, but my mom said
it's time to leave.

14:18.473 --> 14:20.771
Wow.

14:20.808 --> 14:23.072
That's a disappointing
glimpse into your future.

14:23.110 --> 14:24.209
Now, why don't you tell your mom

14:24.244 --> 14:25.476
you want to stick around
for a little while?

14:25.511 --> 14:26.543
That won't work.

14:26.578 --> 14:28.144
She never listens to me.

14:28.178 --> 14:30.244
Oh, now, see, no. That bothers me.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.281
A genius whose fate is
controlled by an idiot?

14:33.316 --> 14:35.748
You think I'm a genius?

14:35.784 --> 14:37.317
Yes! Yes, I think you're a genius.

14:37.352 --> 14:38.652
Are you kidding me?

14:38.686 --> 14:40.252
When I was your age,
I couldn't have accomplished

14:40.287 --> 14:41.754
half the things you did today.

14:41.787 --> 14:43.420
See, this is why the
Chinese are destroying us.

14:43.456 --> 14:44.755
If you were born in China,

14:44.790 --> 14:46.424
you'd be the head of
some factory by now.

14:47.524 --> 14:49.290
Or they would've thrown you in a river,

14:49.327 --> 14:50.927
'cause you weren't a boy.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.393
All right, it's not a great analogy,

14:52.428 --> 14:53.660
but you get my point.

14:53.694 --> 14:54.927
A-Abby...

14:54.962 --> 14:56.661
you deserve better.

14:56.697 --> 14:59.765
Here, I... I want you to have it.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.064
No, what do you mean? You earned that.

15:01.098 --> 15:02.465
No, please, take it.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.101
So you never forget me.

15:07.135 --> 15:08.935
Thanks, Dennis.

15:08.971 --> 15:12.206
For being the first adult to
actually give a shit about me.

15:18.141 --> 15:19.308
You!

15:19.343 --> 15:20.943
Yes?

15:20.976 --> 15:22.107
We need to have a conversation.

15:22.144 --> 15:23.275
Your daughter is a special kid.

15:23.311 --> 15:25.846
A gifted child who should be treasured.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.111
If she were born in China, she...

15:28.148 --> 15:29.914
Wait, I already did that.

15:29.949 --> 15:30.948
Didn't work.

15:30.982 --> 15:32.747
If she were born in...

15:32.784 --> 15:34.950
What country treasures their women?

15:34.986 --> 15:37.251
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

15:37.288 --> 15:39.287
Mom, can I have a slushy?

15:39.321 --> 15:40.754
Yes, in just a minute.

15:40.788 --> 15:41.986
Is that Abby's brother?

15:42.023 --> 15:43.120
I don't have a daughter.

15:43.155 --> 15:44.457
Yes, you do. The girl that was just...

15:47.726 --> 15:49.891
<i>Please take it.</i>

15:52.563 --> 15:54.261
So you never forget me.

15:54.297 --> 15:57.730
<i>See, an artist
takes whatever he wants...</i>

15:58.966 --> 16:00.065
...when somebody's looking right at him.

16:06.303 --> 16:08.169
What is wrong with you? Why are you...?

16:12.808 --> 16:15.241
Huh.

16:18.379 --> 16:20.111
How would you even describe
something like that?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.546
It's so beautiful.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.380
They should've sent a poet.

16:23.414 --> 16:25.513
- All right, let's go, let's go.
- Okay.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.680
- All right, all right.
- Okay.

16:27.742 --> 16:29.317
Here we go.

16:29.351 --> 16:30.549
Oh, oh.

16:30.586 --> 16:31.986
All right.

16:32.019 --> 16:33.183
This should be good, right?

16:33.220 --> 16:34.218
Oh, that's great.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.353
- That'll do it.
- Oh!

16:35.389 --> 16:36.688
Who's going first?

16:36.721 --> 16:39.189
Well, it should be you, right?

16:39.223 --> 16:40.556
I mean, you pulled off the AIDS thing.

16:40.591 --> 16:42.557
Oh, Charlie! Charlie!

16:42.593 --> 16:43.659
All right!

16:43.694 --> 16:44.792
Let's go before we get caught.

16:44.828 --> 16:45.793
Let's go before we get busted, okay?

16:45.826 --> 16:46.791
- All right, here we go.
- All right.

16:46.826 --> 16:48.193
- All right.
- Ready, Frankie!

16:48.228 --> 16:49.960
- I won't let you down!
- All right!

16:49.996 --> 16:52.228
- I like the spirit here.
- Oh!

16:52.265 --> 16:54.465
Oh, it burns! It burns!
It burns! It burns!

16:54.501 --> 16:56.300
Aah!

17:03.072 --> 17:04.638
My back!

17:04.674 --> 17:05.739
That guy has AIDS!
