01:50.920 --> 01:55.920
His Butler,

01:50.920 --> 01:55.920
<font size="50">His Butler,</font>

01:51.360 --> 01:55.920
A Phan

01:51.360 --> 01:55.920
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">A Phan</font></font>

01:51.990 --> 01:55.920
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">tasm</font></font>

02:05.390 --> 02:09.060
So then, what was this matter you wanted to discuss with us?

02:09.770 --> 02:12.770
There is a job I want you three to do.

02:13.150 --> 02:15.030
J-o-b?

02:16.450 --> 02:18.200
What a relief!

02:18.200 --> 02:22.260
Being called up to the young master, I thought we were going to be fired for sure!

02:23.490 --> 02:29.290
This is one of the items that Talbot is said to have collected; a camera with a past.

02:29.290 --> 02:32.400
I heard this long-lost item had suddenly come up at auction,

02:32.400 --> 02:34.920
and I went to quite some trouble to acquire it.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.790
Talcum?

02:40.640 --> 02:44.010
William Henry Fox Talbot.

02:44.010 --> 02:48.350
He was an English scientist, and one of the inventors of photographic technology.

02:44.180 --> 02:48.350
William Henry Fox Talbot.

02:48.350 --> 02:54.350
There is a strange rumour surrounding the final camera he used.

02:54.350 --> 02:57.230
It says that if you take a picture of someone with the camera,

02:57.230 --> 03:04.320
then the being most treasured by that person may also be revealed in the photograph.

03:04.320 --> 03:07.200
The thing most important to that person?

03:07.200 --> 03:11.110
And this is that nifty camera?

03:11.110 --> 03:13.170
Let’s take one as a test.

03:13.850 --> 03:17.800
Don’t move. This camera takes ten seconds for the negative exposure.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.440
What’s negative exposure?

03:22.440 --> 03:25.390
Put simply, it reflects and burns Finny’s image.

03:25.390 --> 03:28.720
If you don’t stay still for ten seconds, it will blur and won’t come out properly.

03:29.430 --> 03:32.350
Eight. Nine. Ten.

03:32.350 --> 03:33.150
All right.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.570
It was fine to breathe, though…

03:43.360 --> 03:46.640
Ah! That’s my little bird!

03:46.640 --> 03:48.910
Huh? You had a little bird?

03:48.910 --> 03:51.410
How cute!

03:51.410 --> 03:56.690
I gave it food every day and eventually it would come to eat from my hand.

03:56.690 --> 03:59.380
I was so happy, and when I went to pet it nicely…

04:02.300 --> 04:04.530
It stopped moving.

04:04.530 --> 04:05.640
Y—You mean it…

04:11.180 --> 04:13.340
Ah, I forgot to mention something.

04:13.340 --> 04:18.850
The precious thing that is reflected is something which does not belong in this world.

04:18.850 --> 04:21.320
In other words, only the dead.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.700
Th—The dead?

04:22.700 --> 04:24.500
By that, you mean…

04:24.500 --> 04:29.650
The most precious thing to that person which is not of this world.

04:29.650 --> 04:32.700
In other words, it means the dead will be transposed to the photograph.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.870
Do occult stories like that really exist in this 19th Century world?

04:38.870 --> 04:42.170
How amazing! What an exceptional camera!

04:43.070 --> 04:46.470
Ah, my little birdie!

04:46.470 --> 04:50.170
Take a picture of Sebastian with this camera.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.680
However, do it without him realising.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.910
A sneak photo?

04:55.910 --> 04:57.060
Yeah.

04:57.940 --> 05:01.690
Wh—Who is the one that Sebastian cares most for?

05:01.690 --> 05:02.970
I’d kind of like to know.

05:02.970 --> 05:07.410
That bastard is always finding flaws in my artistic cooking!

05:07.410 --> 05:09.370
He’s human, too!

05:09.370 --> 05:11.790
He must have a weak point or two!

05:11.790 --> 05:13.930
This is our chance!

05:13.930 --> 05:15.280
You’ll do it, right?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.460
Yes, my Lord!

05:17.460 --> 05:20.480
Ah, I’ve always wanted to say that!

05:20.480 --> 05:21.840
I said it!

05:21.840 --> 05:24.250
If a picture was taken of “that thing” with this camera,

05:24.250 --> 05:26.680
I really do wonder what would come up.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.310
This will be something to see.

05:37.320 --> 05:42.650
At this time of day, Sebastian is normally in the library.

05:46.150 --> 05:47.860
Stay still!

05:47.860 --> 05:49.710
I—It’s ten seconds!

05:49.710 --> 05:50.570
Ten seconds.

05:55.290 --> 05:56.790
So fast!

05:56.790 --> 05:59.120
He’s so fast I’m having trouble keeping track of him with my eyes!

05:59.120 --> 06:01.130
Damn it! There’s no way we can snap him like this.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.420
Ah. He stopped!

06:04.420 --> 06:06.170
Great. Now’s our chance!

06:16.320 --> 06:18.000
I forgot to take it.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.730
How wonderful.

06:20.850 --> 06:24.070
Next up is the cleaning of various rooms.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.340
Watch out!

06:52.010 --> 06:55.720
Then come his daily duties in the butler room.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.650
Come in.

07:05.890 --> 07:07.360
Was there something you wanted?

07:08.140 --> 07:09.150
It’s untied.

07:12.220 --> 07:13.570
Understood.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.290
Sebastian, your face looks wonderful in profile as well.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.210
All right! Now, just like that!

07:22.210 --> 07:25.000
Four. Five. Six…

07:34.340 --> 07:36.850
Let’s let some air in.

07:44.240 --> 07:49.270
Why do we have to go to all this trouble just to take a single photo?

07:51.360 --> 07:54.310
There is a job I’d like to ask all of you to do.

07:54.310 --> 07:56.370
Wh—What is it?

07:56.370 --> 07:57.160
That.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.100
What’s up with the pooch?

08:02.100 --> 08:04.160
In the afternoon, we shall be receiving a guest.

08:04.160 --> 08:09.380
Please move that somewhere out of sight before then, that it will not offend our guest’s eyes.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.880
Somewhere out of sight being…

08:11.880 --> 08:13.760
I will leave that up to you.

08:13.760 --> 08:18.350
Hey, we have our own jobs to do as well.

08:18.350 --> 08:24.290
You can do it in between your other jobs. Just make sure it is done before our guest arrives.

08:28.320 --> 08:32.020
Now I should be able to concentrate on my own work for a while.

08:32.450 --> 08:34.610
Plu Plu, come here!

08:45.920 --> 08:48.550
Here, now!

09:00.290 --> 09:04.320
W—Wow! Plu can breathe fire, too!

09:04.320 --> 09:06.250
That’s a Devil Dog for you.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.400
Wait. This is no time to be dawdling!

09:13.280 --> 09:16.270
For Heaven’s sake. What are they doing?

09:16.270 --> 09:17.570
Is something the matter?

09:17.570 --> 09:21.590
No. Nothing. I will take dinner in here today as well.

09:21.590 --> 09:23.650
Understood.

09:33.960 --> 09:43.680
-mid-

09:51.110 --> 09:54.250
Good grief. Those three…

09:54.250 --> 09:57.500
It would probably be better if they were just eaten by him.

10:02.370 --> 10:03.790
Oh, my.

10:14.840 --> 10:20.880
What a supple body, and soft paws.

10:22.150 --> 10:25.020
Ah. Cats are so sublime.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.700
Why does something always interrupt?

10:42.150 --> 10:44.330
I’m sorry, Young Master.

10:44.330 --> 10:47.440
But Bard has thought up a cunning plan!

10:47.440 --> 10:50.460
It came to me after seeing the pooch breathe fire.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.950
Don’t go using any flame-throwers.

10:52.950 --> 10:54.250
How depressing.

10:55.170 --> 10:56.900
Earl!

10:56.900 --> 10:58.320
Master Lau!

10:58.320 --> 10:59.770
What did you come here for?

10:59.770 --> 11:02.430
I heard something interesting was going on.

11:02.430 --> 11:03.350
Go home.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.920
Don’t say such cold things.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.930
Leave this to me.

11:09.140 --> 11:12.670
The spider’s web has already been woven.

11:12.670 --> 11:17.560
The more you struggle, the harder it becomes to escape from those bonds.

11:17.560 --> 11:22.990
Whatever the prey, once they get involved with me, catching them is only a matter of time.

11:24.950 --> 11:29.150
All right. However, I will not tolerate failure.

11:29.150 --> 11:30.330
No matter what.

11:31.460 --> 11:32.890
But of course.

11:32.890 --> 11:38.710
If I sullied the Phantomhive name, I’d be ejected from this country, after all.

11:40.470 --> 11:42.680
So, what are we doing?

11:50.430 --> 11:51.810
Welcome.

11:52.900 --> 11:56.020
I am Paul Jones of the Brit Business Company.

11:56.730 --> 12:00.140
Mr. Jones, we have been awaiting your arrival.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.900
This way, please.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.580
And so it begins.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.760
What is with that?

12:30.760 --> 12:33.080
Oh, how strange.

12:33.080 --> 12:37.150
I thought that would definitely make that butler stop and look for a second.

12:37.150 --> 12:40.800
I am an idiot for believing in you for even a moment.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.860
It’s too early to give up yet.

12:54.620 --> 12:55.620
Wow!

12:56.880 --> 12:58.240
Wait. That’s not the right target!

12:58.240 --> 12:59.170
Where is he?

13:01.520 --> 13:02.590
Mr. Jones?

13:02.590 --> 13:05.260
Oh. Oh, yes!

13:06.410 --> 13:09.330
Ah, how strange.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.020
What a waste of time.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.940
There is the Executive Director of the Phantom Company, Mr. Tanaka.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.700
Well then, I shall begin my questions immediately.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.000
I wonder what the earl is doing all on his own.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.880
Is he sulking?

13:35.880 --> 13:39.250
He said he wanted to think on his own for a while, but…

13:39.250 --> 13:41.500
The young master is pretty serious this time.

13:43.510 --> 13:47.020
To stop that thing for ten seconds…

13:49.180 --> 13:52.390
This was the last thing I wanted to resort to,

13:52.390 --> 13:54.770
but I guess I have no choice but to make that move.

13:58.520 --> 14:03.690
Next, can you please tell me what the Phantom Company’s business strategy is from here on out?

14:07.200 --> 14:08.630
Huh?

14:08.630 --> 14:13.170
Currently, our company specialises in toy manufacturing and confectionery as its principal business.

14:13.170 --> 14:15.910
However, from here on out, we will expand into other areas as well.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.870
At the present moment, our company…

14:28.870 --> 14:29.890
Yes?

14:29.890 --> 14:32.780
is proceeding with its plan to widen its business within Europe.

14:32.780 --> 14:37.720
To begin with, we will expand with new branches in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam and Athens.

14:37.720 --> 14:42.420
In addition, within the next five years, including those in North America, we plan to have a presence in 30 countries.

14:44.380 --> 14:50.310
Also, in Provence, in the south of France, we plan to have a sweet factory, and in Salzburg, in Austria, we will build a toy factory.

14:50.310 --> 14:53.700
We are working very hard to ensure there are ample quantities of all our products.

14:55.620 --> 15:00.450
The Phantom Company is always striving to maintain and improve the quality of all products under our brand!

14:58.620 --> 15:10.340
Phantomhive

15:00.450 --> 15:02.830
Using stale materials or reusing unsold products is blasphemy!

15:02.830 --> 15:06.640
Only products that have gone through rigorous testing, multiple times, are allowed to be part of the

15:06.640 --> 15:09.310
Phantom line and released into the cities.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.280
Also, our company motto is: “The customer is always right”.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.310
No matter what remote land they hail from, we shall be there to assist them with our products at a moment’s notice!

15:18.310 --> 15:22.090
We deliver our flawless products, through a flawless delivery system, right to our customer’s door.

15:22.090 --> 15:24.060
That is the Phantomhive way.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.270
Right?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.230
That is all.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.820
Th—Thank you very much.

15:32.820 --> 15:35.410
The last thing I need now is a single picture.

15:35.410 --> 15:36.830
A picture?

15:36.830 --> 15:38.880
If possible, with you included as well.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.490
I must decline.

15:41.110 --> 15:43.960
I am just one hell of a butler, after all.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.880
Today, I have prepared the Devil Dog Cake from our trip to Houndsworth.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.900
<font size="14"><font color="#f0aa6b" face="Californian FB"><b>Devil Dog Cake</font></font></b>

15:53.990 --> 15:56.220
Why is there something like this…

15:56.220 --> 15:59.470
It seems that Bard and the others bought an insane quantity of it.

15:59.470 --> 16:01.390
How did the article go?

16:01.390 --> 16:05.650
Tanaka showed his formidable strengths as company president.

16:05.650 --> 16:09.980
I see. Well, it’s not like I can be the face of the company at present.

16:09.980 --> 16:13.820
Yes. There was a photograph taken at the end as well.

16:13.820 --> 16:14.700
A photograph?

16:14.700 --> 16:19.200
Yes. Lately, it seems that having a photographic portrait accompany an article is the fashion.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.160
I see.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.370
Young Master, how about having one taken as well?

16:23.370 --> 16:25.290
Nonsense.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.710
It’s about time.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.450
Is this really all right?

16:47.450 --> 16:48.110
Yeah.

16:48.110 --> 16:49.440
But…

16:49.440 --> 16:50.910
It’s fine. Just do it!

16:50.910 --> 16:51.900
Yes!

17:09.339 --> 17:10.550
Young Master!

18:00.390 --> 18:03.730
Isn’t this a wonderful scene?

18:03.730 --> 18:04.900
You’re late.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.060
I’m sorry.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.530
I was making preparations for tonight’s dinner.

18:09.530 --> 18:13.520
Today’s main dish is a Rouen-style roast duck.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.230
I see.

18:16.700 --> 18:19.490
You should have just ordered me to let you take it.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.520
What?

18:21.520 --> 18:25.200
Whatever you order me to do, I will do right away.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.630
What are you talking about?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.510
We finally took one!

18:39.510 --> 18:42.420
The fruits of a day’s hard labour!

18:42.420 --> 18:44.350
That’s the young master for you.

18:54.870 --> 18:57.690
All right. I’m beginning to see it.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.570
Plu Plu?

19:07.430 --> 19:08.500
Plu?

19:19.660 --> 19:22.840
Aren’t you going to go and see, Earl?

19:38.640 --> 19:40.040
Good.

19:49.210 --> 19:53.830
He has once again concocted a most elaborate prank.

19:54.620 --> 19:57.040
Sleep outside at night.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.180
Excuse me. It is time for bed.

20:16.050 --> 20:20.570
Sleeping out here like this… How sloppy.

20:23.600 --> 20:31.500
That aside, it would seem that the number of unnecessary jobs has increased again.

20:45.340 --> 20:48.050
Sebastian got transposed!

20:48.050 --> 20:54.020
So then, the one the who is most important to the young master is Sebastian?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.750
So, that’s how it is.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.060
They’re really close friends!

20:58.060 --> 20:59.960
The young master is my rival.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.290
What should I do?

21:01.290 --> 21:02.650
Ah! Plu Plu!

21:04.090 --> 21:07.080
Which means…

21:07.080 --> 21:11.330
So, the one Sebastian cares for the most is Plu?

21:11.330 --> 21:13.000
Is that true?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.940
Or is it really the young master?

21:15.940 --> 21:17.040
Which is it?

21:20.720 --> 21:22.260
I’m honoured.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.400
Shut up.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.430
It is your own fault for leaving yourself defenceless while asleep.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.010
You bastard.

21:28.840 --> 21:33.160
The image reflected in a picture is but an illusion.

21:33.160 --> 21:41.480
However, even if it is an illusion, wishing to hold onto it is one of the hollow dreams humans have.

21:52.790 --> 21:58.250
But wait. Wasn’t that camera only supposed to transpose things like my little birdie?

22:03.060 --> 22:06.670
Why is Sebastian transposed?

22:21.710 --> 22:24.060
Well, whatever!

22:42.160 --> 22:45.040
Nothing I say comes out right.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.800
I can't love without a fight.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.550
No one ever knows my name.

22:50.550 --> 22:53.260
When I pray for sun, it rains.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.970
I'm so sick of wasting time,

22:55.970 --> 22:58.680
but nothing's moving in my mind.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.430
Inspiration can't be found.

23:01.430 --> 23:03.640
I get up and fall, but...

23:03.640 --> 23:06.440
I'm alive!

23:06.440 --> 23:08.770
I'm alive!

23:08.770 --> 23:09.690
Oh yeah!

23:09.690 --> 23:13.110
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:13.110 --> 23:14.610
reaching for Heaven!

23:14.610 --> 23:17.370
I will fight!

23:17.370 --> 23:19.620
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:19.620 --> 23:22.330
I live my life!

23:22.790 --> 23:25.540
I'm alive!

23:25.540 --> 23:27.880
I'm alive!

23:27.880 --> 23:29.120
Oh yeah!

23:29.120 --> 23:32.260
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:32.260 --> 23:33.800
reaching for Heaven!

23:33.800 --> 23:36.550
I will fight!

23:36.550 --> 23:38.760
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:38.760 --> 23:44.270
I live my hard life!

23:44.270 --> 23:50.770
I live my life! I'm alive!

23:57.080 --> 24:03.540
-Preview-

23:57.730 --> 24:02.520
The season of the Frost Fayre Market, which takes place atop the frozen river, has arrived.

24:02.960 --> 24:08.580
The young master ends up enjoying himself while visiting the place.

24:08.580 --> 24:13.040
Your heart will melt seeing such a pure and innocent child’s face

24:14.090 --> 24:16.890
as it gives you a sense of warmth.

24:18.350 --> 24:20.330
Next time on Kuroshitsuji:

24:20.310 --> 24:26.690
Next

24:20.310 --> 24:26.690
His Butler, On Ice

24:20.330 --> 24:22.640
His Butler, On Ice.

24:20.330 --> 24:26.710
<font size="50"><font color="#ffffff">His Butler, On Ice</font></font>

24:20.330 --> 24:26.710
<font size="35"><font color="#ffffff">Preview</font></font>

24:22.640 --> 24:25.320
After all, I am one hell of a butler.

24:26.710 --> 24:29.840
