Once they hook up
the tylium hoses,

Blowing the fuel will barely
put a scratch on the hull,

16:37.914 --> 16:39.581
Did you love her, Chief?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.502
Excuse me?

16:43.628 --> 16:45.420
Boomer. Did you love her?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.093
I thought I did.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.221
When you think you love
somebody, you love them.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.516
That's what love is: thoughts.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.606
She was a Cylon,
a machine.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.403
Is that what Boomer was?
A machine?

17:12.740 --> 17:13.865
A thing?

17:14.075 --> 17:15.867
That's what
she turned out to be.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.286
She was more than that to us.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.331
She was more than that to me.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.252
She was a vital,
living person

17:26.713 --> 17:30.757
aboard my ship
for almost two years.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.343
She couldn't have been
just a machine.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.225
Could you love a machine?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.775
No, sir.
I guess I couldn't.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.909
Cally discharged a firearm
without permission,

18:00.413 --> 18:03.165
endangering
the lives of her shipmates.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.168
30 days in the brig.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.379
Dismissed.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.048
Thank you, sir.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.760
You'll see her again, Chief.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.682
Excuse me?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.977
There are many copies.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.774
You'll see her again.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.418
How many patients
do you have here?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.046
Am I being
interrogated again?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.964
I just think it's odd

18:53.049 --> 18:54.049
that I've been
here for two days,

18:54.133 --> 18:55.759
and I haven't
seen anybody else.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.927
Just you.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.347
We have 223 patients
at the moment,

19:00.431 --> 19:03.809
two doctors, and five teachers
masquerading as nurses.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.728
I know a teacher
masquerading as president.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.772
What's that?

19:09.524 --> 19:11.066
It's awfully quiet.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.820
No screams, no moans, no

19:15.530 --> 19:18.323
"Doctor! Doctor!
Please help me! It hurts. "

19:20.952 --> 19:25.872
Most of our patients are succumbing
to acute radiation poisoning.

19:26.958 --> 19:31.795
Symptoms include powerful
fatigue and immediate nausea.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.924
This is followed by several
days of comparable well-being.

19:36.676 --> 19:41.054
After that, cell death in the
gastric and intestinal tissue causes

19:41.472 --> 19:45.517
massive diarrhea, intestinal
bleeding, and loss of water.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.771
It's not pretty.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.400
But it is quiet.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.237
The biggest killer in
this place is infection.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.030
That's why we have
you under quarantine.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.116
We don't know what you
brought in with you yet.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.618
Your test results
will be back this afternoon.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.375
Okay, almost done.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.754
I think there may be a cyst
on one of your ovaries.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.423
Is it serious?

20:16.507 --> 20:18.133
No, it should be fine.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.176
We'll keep an eye on it.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.429
Gotta keep that reproductive
system in great shape.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.472
That's your most
valuable asset these days.

20:24.807 --> 20:25.807
Right.

20:26.809 --> 20:27.976
I'm serious.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.186
Finding healthy,
child-bearing women your age

20:30.271 --> 20:32.230
is a top priority
for the Resistance,

20:32.565 --> 20:33.857
and you'll be happy to know

20:33.941 --> 20:36.234
that you are a very
precious commodity to us.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.777
(STARBUCK LAUGHS)

20:39.322 --> 20:42.115
I am not a commodity.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.326
I'm a Viper pilot.

20:45.536 --> 20:48.413
You see any
Vipers around here?

20:48.497 --> 20:51.207
I mean, you do realize that
you're one of a handful of women

20:51.292 --> 20:56.171
left on this planet actually
capable of having children, right?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.423
I mean, that is your most
valuable skill right now.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.718
Well, I don't want a child,
so just drop it, okay?

21:02.553 --> 21:04.262
Well, no one's forcing you.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.432
Just take a moment

21:07.516 --> 21:12.187
and think about where you
are and what's going on.

21:13.731 --> 21:16.691
The human race is on
the verge of extinction.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.445
And, to be quite frank
with you, potential mothers

21:20.529 --> 21:22.447
are a lot more
valuable right now

21:22.531 --> 21:25.158
than a whole squadron
of Viper pilots.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.454
I shouldn't have
mentioned it.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.289
I should've known
you'd be sensitive.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.458
A lot of women
with your history

21:33.542 --> 21:35.835
forego bearing
children of their own.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.545
My history?

21:38.214 --> 21:40.548
I saw the fractures
on your X-rays.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.634
A lot of old fractures
from childhood.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.311
It's interesting

21:53.396 --> 21:56.606
how you managed to break
every finger on both hands.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.234
Every break
in the exact same place,

21:59.318 --> 22:02.112
between the first
and the second knuckle.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.748
Did someone
break your fingers, Kara?

22:17.294 --> 22:18.378
Get out.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.133
Children of abusive parents

22:23.259 --> 22:26.928
often fear passing along that
abuse to their own children.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.931
(SCREAMS) Get out!

22:32.101 --> 22:33.268
All right.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.956
Is she kidding with this?

22:55.249 --> 22:56.416
I know it's hard to believe,

22:56.500 --> 22:58.626
but that message has cropped
up all over the fleet.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.962
It's religious crap.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.466
"It seems I have been
chosen to help lead you

23:04.550 --> 23:06.259

declared themselves for us?

picked for you,

picked for yourself.

over this line 10 times already.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.193

taken a bullet.

25:28.319 --> 25:29.819
She was right here
by the vehicles.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.946
She would have got up and
crawled the frak out of here.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.699
Hey, we have to search
the entire area again.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.911
I told you we shouldn't
have pulled back so fast.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.245
I thought she was with us.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.622
Anders,
we got ambushed, okay?

25:40.706 --> 25:43.249
We all got separated. There's
nothing we could have done about it.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.751

would understand.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.211

wait for Starbuck

26:54.530 --> 26:56.197

"Be fruitful. "

38:15.085 --> 38:17.586
We can't fulfill it. We've
tried. So we decided...

38:17.671 --> 38:19.129
To rape human women.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.426
You know, if you agreed to bear
children, it'd be voluntary.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.762
Maybe even set you up
with someone you like.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.640
Like you two kids?

38:30.266 --> 38:31.433
We're different.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.061
What the frak
is that supposed to mean?

38:34.229 --> 38:35.980
They have this theory.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.233
Maybe the one thing they
were missing was love.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.988
So Sharon and I,

38:46.574 --> 38:47.533
we're set up...

38:47.617 --> 38:48.742
To fall in love?

38:50.245 --> 38:53.622
They didn't ask Sue-Shaun if she
wanted to fall in love, all right?

38:53.707 --> 38:57.126
They put a tube in her, and
they hooked her up to a machine!

39:00.714 --> 39:02.798
They know who you are, Kara.

39:04.884 --> 39:05.884
You're special.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.096
Leoben told you that.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.474
You have a destiny.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.857
HELO: Starbuck,
what's this second scar?

39:19.941 --> 39:21.734
I don't know.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.610
I don't think
I wanna know now.

39:26.448 --> 39:27.740
You know?

39:28.491 --> 39:29.533
No.

39:30.535 --> 39:33.328
All right, how many women
do they have at these farms?

39:33.955 --> 39:36.790
Hundreds.
Maybe thousands.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.835
I don't know. I haven't
accessed that data.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.881
Here's what we do.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.592
Take the Heavy Raider, cram
it full of ground troops,

39:46.676 --> 39:49.219
find out where the next farm
is, liberate it, then the next,

39:49.304 --> 39:50.262
and the next,
and the next.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.681
No. No, that's not
why you came to Caprica.

40:29.511 --> 40:30.886
Go find Earth.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.686
What about you?

40:41.439 --> 40:44.399
You said you needed
professional advice.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.027
We'll muddle through.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.530
We've managed so far.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.700
They'll kill you.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.037
You'll die here.
You know that.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.498
A lot of people died here,

41:01.042 --> 41:04.545
but I'll tell you this:
If I'm gonna die here,

41:04.629 --> 41:07.047
I'm gonna take out every last
one of those frakking farms

41:07.132 --> 41:08.298
before I do.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.264
I'm not gonna leave you here.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.770
You said you were gonna
come back, remember?

41:23.898 --> 41:25.399
I'm gonna hold you to it.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.095
I'm coming back.

41:56.431 --> 41:57.598
I said it.

41:58.308 --> 41:59.558
I meant it.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.103
Yeah, okay.

42:09.402 --> 42:10.485
Hey.

42:13.615 --> 42:15.073
Be safe.

42:20.622 --> 42:21.914
Let's go home.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.205
