00:06.574 --> 00:07.441
*

00:07.475 --> 00:08.542
* Hey, everyone

00:08.576 --> 00:10.744
* Gotta keep on marching on

00:10.778 --> 00:13.347
* Well, hey, hey, hey,
everyone *

00:13.381 --> 00:16.750
* Gotta keep on marching on
and on and on... *

00:16.784 --> 00:19.387
*

01:16.744 --> 01:19.513
(silenced gunshots,
man grunting)

01:23.517 --> 01:25.819
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:25.853 --> 01:28.656
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:28.689 --> 01:30.891
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:30.924 --> 01:32.326
* How, how, how, how

01:32.360 --> 01:34.495
* Hey, hey

01:40.568 --> 01:41.802
* You gotta come on.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.309
LASALLE:
Smooth motions.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.677
Keep a rhythm.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.779
Get Pride bought a bar,

01:51.812 --> 01:53.781
working out a new
phase in his life;

01:53.814 --> 01:55.683
I also get chipping in
before work,

01:55.716 --> 01:58.386
help him set the place up--
but what I don't get

01:58.419 --> 02:01.189
is why I'm
the only one laboring.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.191
: Uh,
I'm in recovery.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.393
Remember? 'Cause
Pride shot me?

02:05.426 --> 02:07.728
You don't watch it,
I'm gonna shoot you next.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.631
So, uh,
what's your excuse, Merri?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.366
I know it may look
like I'm slacking,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.835
but we've got you doing
advanced field training.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.470
Testing my carpentry skills?

02:16.504 --> 02:17.805
Nope. Multitasking.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.840
If I tell you
I went to the MCRD

02:19.873 --> 02:21.842
to see the RTB
to meet the SDI...

02:21.875 --> 02:23.811
You'd go to
the Marine Corps Depot

02:23.844 --> 02:25.313
to the Recruit
Training Battalion

02:25.346 --> 02:27.147
to see the Senior
Drill Instructor.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.851
Marine captain enters
a Navy captain's berth

02:30.884 --> 02:32.886
on a ship.
Who salutes first?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.322
Typically, Marine
salutes sailor--

02:34.355 --> 02:36.490
Navy captain has rank--
but in this case,

02:36.524 --> 02:37.758
no one salutes...

02:37.791 --> 02:39.793
because they're indoors.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.429
:
Poof.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.830
Goat locker.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.765
What is it?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.334
The, uh...

02:46.367 --> 02:47.735
goat locker...

02:47.768 --> 02:50.771
is where you store...

02:50.804 --> 02:52.673
your goats.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.675
Chief petty
officer's galley

02:54.708 --> 02:56.477
and sleeping area

02:56.510 --> 02:57.745
on a ship.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.514
Terminology may not
matter in the ATF,

03:00.548 --> 03:02.250
but it's the lifeblood
of the Navy.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.251
I get it.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.652
For instance, uh,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.354
what's the term
for this new lady

03:06.387 --> 03:08.822
you've been seeing?
I know a lot of ladies.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.825
Uh, you brought in your
nice jacket yesterday.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.561
The Commander's Palace jacket.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.396
Oh.
That's his big third-date move.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.797
Well, the move was
clearly successful,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.699
because, um...

03:18.732 --> 03:20.568
I can still smell
her perfume.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.835
She's classy.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.837
Creed Royal.
She's a professional.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.273
Doctor?
Lawyer.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.340
Banker, if you must know.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.975
Mm.
Mm.
And it was a first date.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.778
Beer and crawfish don't work
on these white-collar types.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.546
Oh.
And as much as I'm enjoying

03:32.580 --> 03:33.981
you snooping
into my personal life,

03:34.014 --> 03:35.349
it's a text from King.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.251
Body at Monteleone.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.353
Get our game face on.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.954
PRIDE:
Victim's name was Jonah Penn.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.890
Couple of conventioneers
spotted him

03:42.923 --> 03:45.593
on his balcony this morning,
thought he was passed out.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.895
Called hotel security.
Place is a mess.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.897
Penn some kind
of sailor on leave?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.565
Blogger from Pittsburgh.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.733
Why call us?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.402
Follow me.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.738
Top secret Navy documents--
the real deal.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.007
Or at least they were.
Gone now.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.009
Whoa. What's a blogger

04:02.042 --> 04:04.645
from Pittsburgh doing
with Navy documents?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.914
I'll call intel, get into it.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.983
Maintenance had to break in
this morning.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.953
According to hotel records...

04:12.986 --> 04:15.289
Penn's key card was the only one

04:15.323 --> 04:16.857
used to enter this room

04:16.890 --> 04:18.559
in the last couple of days.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.561
Door was bolted from the inside.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.563
No other access point
to the room.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.398
How'd the suspect
get in?

04:24.432 --> 04:28.302
NOPD found traces of
high-density nylon
rope on the roof.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.006
That joker rappelled down?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.675
It would explain

04:34.708 --> 04:38.045
the vertical trajectory
of the entry wounds.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.314
He was shot three times
from above.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.750
Some ninja moves!
No one saw?

04:42.783 --> 04:45.018
Avoided every witness
and surveillance camera

04:45.052 --> 04:46.387
in the hotel.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.955
Three shots
to the chest.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.923
Tight grouping--
looks professional.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.361
Maybe professional;
far from impersonal.

04:53.394 --> 04:57.398
The killer cut out Penn's
tongue, postmortem...

04:58.532 --> 04:59.867
...placed it in his palm.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.506
I'll bet you never saw
a tongue-ectomy in ATF.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.009
There's got to be
some intel missing,

05:09.042 --> 05:11.845
'cause I got a... an empty
top secret jacket.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.847
I appreciate that.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.983
I appreciate that, Admiral.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.519
'Cause I have a lot
of questions.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.424
Making house calls now?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.359
Yeah, I had to come see you
right away.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.060
I know your dead guy,
Jonah Penn.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.996
What?
Well, not know in the

05:29.029 --> 05:30.831
conventional sense
of having a relationship

05:30.864 --> 05:33.501
or personal interaction
or any sort of history.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.003
What other sense is there?
Well, we were
virtual acquaintances.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.038
In the Skep-Con community.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.840
It's skeptics
and conspiracy theorists.

05:39.873 --> 05:40.974
Penn was a superstar.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.976
He exposed corruption
and cover-ups

05:43.010 --> 05:45.379
all over the government.
You were in
contact with him?

05:45.413 --> 05:48.549
Well, no, but he blogged
that he was going on the road
for some big story.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.984
He bragged that he was
gonna blow the lid off of...

05:51.018 --> 05:54.388
the "twisted psyche of
the American military machine."

05:54.422 --> 05:56.490
He had a flair
for the dramatic.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.826
You're thinking this story had
something to do with the Navy?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.794
Well...
So, I ran ballistics

06:00.828 --> 06:05.065
on the slugs that Loretta pulled
from Penn's body.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.535
Nine-millimeter, 147-grain

06:07.568 --> 06:09.102
NATO rounds.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.104
Subsonic, laced
with depleted uranium.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.106
Sound-suppressing,
armor-piercing.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.808
Military.
I traced the bullets

06:14.842 --> 06:16.910
back to a batch that
the Navy requisitioned

06:16.944 --> 06:19.547
for a special mission
code-named Operation Sawback.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.814
What's Operation Sawback?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.550
I have no idea.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.117
It's compartmented way above
my clearance-- which is not

06:24.151 --> 06:26.119
very high, and actually
I've been meaning to talk

06:26.153 --> 06:27.020
to you about that.
Sebastian.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.022
But I did find out
the name

06:29.056 --> 06:30.991
of the unit involved.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.628
PRIDE:
Shadow Unit.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.964
Navy SEALs.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.632
Your murderer is among

06:38.666 --> 06:40.434
one of the best-trained killers
in the world.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.448
Jonah Penn was murdered
with bullets

06:54.482 --> 06:56.850
designated
for a Navy SEAL team--

06:56.884 --> 06:59.453
Shadow Unit--
in a mission called Sawback.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.788
There's a good chance

07:00.821 --> 07:03.190
our suspect is a SEAL.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.626
Got to be careful.
And move fast.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.095
Navy better cooperate.
They won't even admit
documents are missing.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.797
What more do we know
about our reporter, Penn?

07:09.830 --> 07:12.833
Freelance journalist in town
working on his story.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.702
Got any line on his story?
He was tight-lipped.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.004
Protecting his "get." Family
and friends didn't even know

07:17.037 --> 07:19.006
he was in New Orleans.
What'd you get
off Penn's laptop?

07:19.039 --> 07:20.974
Nothing. Wiped clean.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.644
Wrong, wrong.
So damn wrong.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.813
I assure you,
no one wiped anything clean.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.715
That's-that's not even a thing.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.850
There's not even an
e-mail on this laptop.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.919
Yeah, well, we live
in the age of the NSA.

07:31.952 --> 07:32.986
We got eavesdropping,

07:33.020 --> 07:34.221
anonymous hackers...

07:34.254 --> 07:35.889
let's face it, people like me

07:35.923 --> 07:37.925
who sneak on your computer
without you even knowing.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.660
So he changed his computer out?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.529
As much as he changes
his T-shirts.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.930
He keeps his files
in a cloud.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.164
Can you retrieve
anything?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.700
I'm a little hurt
you even doubt it.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
Loretta.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.239
You and me.
Chris, SEAL team

07:52.272 --> 07:54.708
Shadow Unit is stationed
out of Stennis Space Center.

07:54.742 --> 07:55.943
Take Percy.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.110
You got it, King.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.883
LASALLE:
So, about SEALs.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.885
Sea, Air, Land.
Already know.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.120
That's about as much
as they'll let you know.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.757
They don't talk easy and
they don't trust outsiders.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.991
Look...

08:11.024 --> 08:12.593
I spent my entire career

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
earning the trust
of gunrunners and biker gangs.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.930
I got my ways.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.833
SEALs operate at a higher
level of distrust.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.235
Sort of like Fight Club.
Oh, like,

08:22.269 --> 08:25.806
"First rule of SEALs,
don't talk about SEALs"?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.541
I'm just preparing you.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.710
It's gonna take a little
more than your "ways"

08:29.743 --> 08:31.612
to open 'em up.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.913
War...
War...

08:32.946 --> 08:34.648
Eagle! Hey!
Eagle! Hey!

08:34.682 --> 08:36.149
Why didn't you tell me

08:36.183 --> 08:37.985
the newbie's
a fellow Tiger?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.987
I'm just finding out
about it myself.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.822
He's from 'Bama.
Roll Tide.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.157
You know, my time at Auburn
really defined my character.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.926
Made me who I am today.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.195
So, Operation Sawback?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.030
Happy to read you in.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.699
Especially since
it's declassified.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.100
And since you're
a fellow Tiger,

08:53.133 --> 08:56.036
I can save you the trouble
of reading a 3,000-page file.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.337
Appreciate that.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.906
First off,
it wasn't our op.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.207
CIA mission.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.242
They oversaw;
we provided support.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.778
Sawback was strictly
humanitarian.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.082
There we go.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.751
Ejército Del Pueblo.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.219
Army of the People.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.222
Paramilitary group in Bolivia,
a place called San Martel.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.824
Muscle for the drug lords.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.058
Rooting out resistance

09:18.091 --> 09:19.727
and terrorize the locals.
Sent in

09:19.760 --> 09:21.595
a small team of SEALs,
Shadow Unit.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.930
Dropped in,
protected the locals,

09:22.963 --> 09:25.633
dismantled the PA--
rousing success.

09:25.666 --> 09:29.036
If it was such a success,
why was Jonah Penn

09:29.069 --> 09:30.638
so interested in it?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.673
Penn was a bottom-feeder,
always looking

09:32.706 --> 09:34.942
for negative spin.
Bad blood?

09:34.975 --> 09:38.045
I spend my days surrounded by
the enemy in hostile territory.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.914
It takes more than bad press
to hurt my feelings.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.283
There's a big old "but" coming.
But...

09:43.316 --> 09:45.052
there's not
a single sailor or Marine

09:45.085 --> 09:46.787
whose safety
wasn't compromised by Penn

09:46.820 --> 09:48.856
and the lies he printed
over the years.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.958
Which could explain
why three rounds of ammo

09:50.991 --> 09:53.961
slated for Sawback
ended up in Penn's chest.

09:53.994 --> 09:57.865
Are you suggesting
one of my men was involved?

09:57.898 --> 09:59.700
I'm suggesting

09:59.733 --> 10:03.170
that you give us the identity
of every member of Shadow Unit

10:03.203 --> 10:05.138
and their last known
whereabouts.

10:07.841 --> 10:11.178
The methodology of this murder
is cold, professional.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.648
Removal of the victim's
tongue was surgical.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.650
Killer took care,

10:16.684 --> 10:18.652
like he'd practiced
this before.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.088
What can you tell
us about the knife?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.891
Sharp. Non-serrated.
That's about all.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.793
However,

10:25.826 --> 10:28.829
judging by the inflammation
of Mr. Penn's stomach lining,

10:28.862 --> 10:31.364
I can say that
he suffered from ulcers.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.900
There was
scar tissue

10:32.933 --> 10:34.134
and several gastrinoma.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.804
Someone who suffers

10:36.837 --> 10:38.739
from this severe a condition

10:38.772 --> 10:42.342
would be prescribed
a very bland diet.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.312
Yet this is what I
found in his stomach.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.816
Fatty beef,
chorizo sausage, lard,

10:48.849 --> 10:50.083
locoto peppers.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.318
South American food.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.120
Bolivian, to be exact.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.022
Operation Sawback
took place in Bolivia.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.289
Sebastian pulled Mr. Penn's

10:56.323 --> 10:58.391
room service charges.
Oatmeal,

10:58.425 --> 11:01.161
grilled salmon,
skinless chicken.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.130
He was not eating spicy
at the hotel.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.098
Where he got the food
could lead us

11:05.132 --> 11:07.200
to what track
he was on for his story.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.838
SEBASTIAN:
So I count

11:10.871 --> 11:12.139
three straight-up
Bolivian places.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.141
I'll e-mail you the list.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.309
Thanks.
Personal favor?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.880
These have been
mailed to me anonymously.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.415
Does that make you the Jackal?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.284
Nickname in high school.
Long story.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.419
Mine was Mr. Butternut.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.858
Also... long story.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.325
Looks like you
had fun back then.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.927
Yeah, only I wasn't in

11:33.961 --> 11:35.428
the original version
of these photos.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.464
I think someone altered them.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.101
Well, the inpainting is perfect.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.335
Seam carving, too.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.037
Are you...

11:44.071 --> 11:45.438
sure this isn't you?

11:45.472 --> 11:47.140
These are all
my sister's friends.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.341
The one who passed away.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.879
They added me in her place,
after she died.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.114
Is there any way you can
track where these came from?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.049
Yeah. No, I'm-I'm happy
to take a look.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.851
Thank you.
Oh, actually,
you know what,

11:57.885 --> 12:00.120
I also have a
bit of a favor.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.222
Shoot.
I heard what the
SEALs said about Penn,

12:02.255 --> 12:04.124
about how he
falsified sources

12:04.157 --> 12:06.159
and it got him fired,
but that's not the truth.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.796
Penn quit the newspaper when
they tried to edit a story

12:08.829 --> 12:10.530
that he was writing.
He had integrity.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.399
Penn was important to you.

12:12.432 --> 12:16.203
Yeah, a while ago, he-he wrote
about these contractors in Iraq

12:16.236 --> 12:18.538
who were taking kickbacks.
Took him two years to

12:18.571 --> 12:21.208
singlehandedly trace the scandal
back to several congressmen.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.411
He saw a conspiracy when
everyone else turned away.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.181
Penn had a voice.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.484
Let's find out
what he wanted to say.

12:35.288 --> 12:39.092
This man-- his name
is Penn? I don't know,

12:39.126 --> 12:41.829
maybe he came in, maybe not,
we have a lot of customers.
Yeah, well,

12:41.862 --> 12:44.264
not many came in for lunch
three days in a row this week.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.234
He must have
liked my cooking.
Your name's Edgar Baco.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.436
This is your place. I spoke
with two of your waitresses,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.104
they both confirmed
that Penn

12:51.138 --> 12:52.405
came in to see you.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.108
And now he's dead.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.510
Soon I will be, too.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.213
Because... death
is following me

13:00.247 --> 13:02.049
all the way from
San Martel, Bolivia.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.383
That why Penn came to see you?

13:05.185 --> 13:07.320
He was curious about the tragedy
of San Martel.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.256
You are, too?

13:09.289 --> 13:12.359
I know about what the
People's Army did to your town.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.395
Well, the PA demanded money
for protection from the cartels.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.530
The very men they worked for.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.499
Our lives were worthless.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.069
Until the U.S. military
intervened.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.570
Yes, the
Americans came.

13:23.603 --> 13:27.875
They told us we had nothing
left to worry about.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.110
The PA would be stopped.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.181
That turned out to be a lie.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.548
A man came early in the morning.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.250
He rounded up
seven of our leaders

13:37.284 --> 13:40.287
and accused them of cooperating
with the enemy.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.390
He shot them,
cut out their tongues.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.192
One of the People's Army.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.426
No.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.261
He was one of yours.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.198
Sent to protect us.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.567
The rumor was that
the PA paid him off.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.436
To send a message.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.406
To remind us that we would
never be safe again.

13:59.439 --> 14:03.410
I-I left, I...
came here.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.345
Where good people like you

14:05.378 --> 14:07.514
are still outraged by
the savagery of the world.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.185
Is there anyone else
who can confirm your story?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.555
Sí.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.360
Travis Dalton.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.494
Speak to him.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.530
He'll tell you.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.902
I've been managing director
of The Westmar Relief Group

14:28.936 --> 14:31.371
now for, uh, about three years.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.243
We provide food,
medicine, support

14:36.276 --> 14:39.046
to Latin Americans hardest
hit by war and poverty.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.914
People like Edgar Baco?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.382
We brought Edgar
back from Bolivia.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.151
Helped set him up
his restaurant.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.685
The American dream.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.921
After San Martel?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.528
The Navy send you?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.364
Nobody sends me, Mr. Dalton.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.200
I'm here investigating
the murder of Jonah Penn.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.603
Penn was working on a story.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.406
We think he was killed

15:06.439 --> 15:08.008
because what
he was writing about

15:08.041 --> 15:11.444
had to do with a military
operation in San Martel.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.614
Well, some stories are just
too dangerous to tell.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.284
Like the execution of seven men?

15:17.317 --> 15:20.420
By someone
on your people's payroll.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.156
You got proof of that?

15:35.502 --> 15:38.038
Here's your proof.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.073
It's what Jonah Penn
was writing about.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.416
There.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.285
The money shot.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.221
Check the insignia.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.292
PRIDE:
SEALs.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.494
You show these photos
to the Navy?
I just got 'em.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.530
From Jonah Penn.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.432
He brought these to me
last week,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.367
asked me to tell him what I saw.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.401
And where did Penn
get the photos?

16:08.435 --> 16:10.403
Wouldn't tell me.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.439
And even if he did,
I wouldn't tell you.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.309
Talking about this...

16:16.343 --> 16:17.610
could make me

16:17.644 --> 16:20.480
your killer's next victim.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.054
Now, if what Baco
and Dalton say is true,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.622
we're not just investigating
a murder anymore.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.658
Yeah, it's a war crime.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.263
No, go ahead
and respond.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.165
Shouldn't let
the banker girl wait.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.733
She's a banker lady.
And I'm good.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.602
"Good" like
she gets a second date

16:42.635 --> 16:45.638
or "good" like it's over?
Can we focus here?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.574
I don't know, can we?
BRODY: Okay,

16:47.607 --> 16:49.776
of the six active duty SEALs

16:49.809 --> 16:52.812
billeted to Shadow Unit,
four are deployed overseas.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.048
One has been
in wilderness

16:55.082 --> 16:58.051
survival training
for the past 72 hours.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.253
And the last member?
Petty Officer

17:00.287 --> 17:02.722
Wyatt Granier. Recently
put into treatment for showing

17:02.755 --> 17:04.691
signs of depression
and instability.

17:04.724 --> 17:08.361
Lives on the Westbank.
Got a bolo out.
Let's find him.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.330
RECORDING:
The cellular customer
you are trying to reach

17:10.363 --> 17:12.532
is unavailable. Please leave
a message after the beep.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.368
Hey, it's me.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.237
Have you heard from Penn?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.407
'Cause I'm supposed to meet him
and he's still not here.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.609
I'm freaked.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.445
I'm out of here.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.139
NOPD patrol spotted
the car a few hours ago.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.440
Engine's still on,

17:53.473 --> 17:55.375
who knows how long.
Loretta?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.610
Granier was shot from behind.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.279
The same tight grouping
of the wounds.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.448
The same surgical care

18:01.481 --> 18:02.482
with the postmortem

18:02.515 --> 18:03.450
removal
of the tongue.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.519
And again...

18:06.553 --> 18:08.188
the killer takes the term

18:08.221 --> 18:11.224
"hold your tongue"
literally.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.793
Guessing when you pull
the slugs out of the dash,

18:13.826 --> 18:16.463
the bullets'll match
the ones used to kill Penn.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.231
It's an elaborate choreography.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.800
It takes time
and consideration.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.570
Someone murdered Penn

18:23.603 --> 18:27.340
to stop him from writing
about Operation Sawback.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.809
Cut out his tongue as a warning.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.379
Granier was part of Sawback.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.546
You think he was

18:33.580 --> 18:34.847
cooperating with Penn's story

18:34.881 --> 18:36.516
and that's what got him
killed the same way?

18:36.549 --> 18:38.551
Hey, found this cell nearby.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.553
Could be Granier's, but someone
took the SIM card.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.889
NOPD canvassed
the area,

18:42.922 --> 18:45.158
pulled surveillance video.
No sign of the suspect.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.260
Probably ninja'd his way
out of this one, too.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.262
Climbed a wall,
jumped the roof.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.697
Maybe's he's got
the cloak of invisibility.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.432
We know this much--

18:52.465 --> 18:54.767
he can't levitate.
Shoe scuffs.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.871
Must have been
riding in the trunk,

18:58.905 --> 19:01.241
waiting for the right moment.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.643
Not easy to sneak
up on a SEAL.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.778
Suspect
had access

19:05.812 --> 19:08.315
to the back seat
through the trunk.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.649
In and out without a trace.

19:09.682 --> 19:13.320
Actually, guys,
this time...

19:13.353 --> 19:15.455
he left something behind.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.756
PERCY:
Got a DNA hit

19:16.789 --> 19:18.458
on the hair.
It belongs

19:18.491 --> 19:20.627
to Chief Petty Officer
Ryan Jansen,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.662
another Navy SEAL
in Shadow Unit.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.796
Thought he was
already accounted for.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.632
Survival training,
Pearl River.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.966
That's what the SEALs
thought, too.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.669
Turns out Jansen was on
solo survival training.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.770
Commander Salter
radioed him

19:30.803 --> 19:32.672
to return to base,
got no response.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.941
He could have slipped away,
no one would have even noticed.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.677
Plenty of time to come back
here, kill Penn and Granier.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.613
PATTON:
Aw, yeah!
Don't mind me,

19:40.647 --> 19:42.682
I had to resupply.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.983
Check it out.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.687
I got my kale, my carrots,
my B3, my agave.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.556
I got my

19:49.589 --> 19:51.458
bacon chili cheeseburger deluxe.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.793
That's my Triple P
cranial laxative.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.231
Any closer to getting
Penn's digital files?

19:58.265 --> 19:59.666
Like I told you--

19:59.699 --> 20:01.868
Penn's a guy
who's written about the NSA,

20:01.901 --> 20:05.638
the FBI, the IRS and all other
alphabet agencies that

20:05.672 --> 20:08.007
make men tremble.
So you can't get in.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.976
Dude, his encryptions
got encryptions.

20:10.009 --> 20:13.380
But once that agave
and this saturated fat

20:13.413 --> 20:16.516
lubricates the thinkanator--
oh, I'll get there.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.785
I always do.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.487
Excuse you.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.821
Thank you.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.357
Back to Jansen, what do we know?

20:24.391 --> 20:26.659
Highly decorated.
Spent a year at NAB

20:26.693 --> 20:29.028
Coronado teaching
knife combat, but

20:29.061 --> 20:31.498
he's a five-tool player.
Two Silver Stars

20:31.531 --> 20:33.433
for bravery in Afghanistan,

20:33.466 --> 20:35.535
married his
high school sweetheart,

20:35.568 --> 20:37.870
teaches Sunday school.
SONJA: Whoa, what does
that mean?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.772
My Sunday school teacher
was terrifying.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.542
Look, we need to bring Jansen
in before anyone else gets hurt.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.977
I'll reach out to
Edgar Baco and Travis Dalton.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.746
They were both
sources of Penn's story,

20:46.779 --> 20:48.415
could be in danger.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.517
Brody, you're with me.
Let's go learn things

20:50.550 --> 20:54.454
about the man
behind the SEAL.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.524
WOMAN:
I've known my husband
since we were 14 years old.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.658
The moment I laid
eyes on him,

20:58.691 --> 21:00.793
I knew he would be the best man

21:00.827 --> 21:02.795
I'd ever meet.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.432
Now you're telling me
he's some kind of criminal?

21:05.465 --> 21:07.667
Do you know where he is,
Mrs. Jansen?

21:07.700 --> 21:09.669
I never know where Ryan is.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.970
My husband's job

21:11.003 --> 21:12.672
is classified.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.507
Found this in a drawer.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.642
He left it for a reason.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.810
So we couldn't track him.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.912
Checked the call log.
Last one is from Granier.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.013
Wyatt Granier?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.816
They're friends.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.085
You should ask Wyatt about Ryan.
He'll tell you.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.754
Wyatt Granier was murdered.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.558
Listen, we understand you're
trying to protect your husband,

21:31.591 --> 21:33.960
but something is wrong here.
You see this, yes?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.396
What are you suggesting he did?

21:36.429 --> 21:37.830
We're just looking
for the truth.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.567
We get that by
finding Ryan.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.001
If you know of anything, please,

21:42.034 --> 21:44.404
before Ryan
or anyone else gets hurt.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.778
I never know where Ryan is
when he's deployed.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.047
He could be gone
for weeks, months.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.717
But whenever he goes away,
he sends me one of these.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.086
They're
all blank.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.121
A simple way to
tell me he's okay.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.823
This one came this morning.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.464
Kisatchie
National Park.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.469
Park ranger said
Jansen came in yesterday,

22:16.503 --> 22:18.104
got supplies,
and headed north.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.772
Well, what's north?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.475
Woods.
Great...

22:22.509 --> 22:25.945
Mother Nature and I aren't
exactly on speaking terms.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.780
Oh, don't worry, City Mouse.

22:27.814 --> 22:31.150
I'll be glad to
make introductions.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.085
Got ballistics back
on the slugs you pulled

22:33.119 --> 22:34.921
from Petty Officer
Granier's chest.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.923
Nine millimeter, subsonic.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.858
Same rounds
that killed Penn.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.528
Fired from the same weapon.
Not surprising.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.796
Anything else?

22:45.898 --> 22:47.166
Come on. Out with it.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.572
Why does the system always win?

22:52.605 --> 22:53.973
You know?

22:54.006 --> 22:56.576
I mean,
this-this Skep-Con thing,

22:56.609 --> 22:59.846
it's not an act.
I-I really believe

22:59.879 --> 23:02.148
that there's a deeper meaning
in the world,

23:02.181 --> 23:04.050
even if it's menacing,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.886
that-that people can have
an effect,

23:06.919 --> 23:08.755
you know,
reveal the truth.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.790
I mean, we-we need skeptics,

23:10.823 --> 23:13.793
people willing to dig deeper.

23:16.128 --> 23:19.098
People like Penn.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.501
Like you.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.938
I will look
at Petty Officer Granier again,

23:25.972 --> 23:27.640
see what else I find.

23:27.674 --> 23:28.775
Meantime, I'll put

23:28.808 --> 23:30.843
the photos from San Martel up

23:30.877 --> 23:32.479
on the secure server.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.813
Pick up where Penn left off.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.916
Go.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.430
Who's Dave?

23:52.699 --> 23:56.503
Not a banker,
I'll tell you that.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.905
Lady's got her
secrets, huh?
A few.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.740
More than a few,
I've learned.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.009
I went poking.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.944
You didn't go to Auburn.
You went to Tulane.

24:04.977 --> 24:08.481
Yeah, but Tulane
wouldn't get me an in

24:08.515 --> 24:10.483
with the Navy SEAL
commander.

24:10.517 --> 24:13.219
Also wouldn't get
a rise out of you, so...

24:14.921 --> 24:17.123
So, if you got secrets,

24:17.156 --> 24:20.226
how come you givin' me a
hard time about who I date?

24:22.228 --> 24:24.597
Look...

24:24.631 --> 24:26.899
I'm just trying to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.736
That mermaid of yours
was special,

24:29.769 --> 24:31.504
and...

24:31.538 --> 24:34.006
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.576
She's got a name. Savannah.

24:36.609 --> 24:39.145
And you don't know
anything about it.
Stop.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.847
Oh, it's okay for you
to poke back, but...

24:40.880 --> 24:41.914
No, I mean stop the truck.

24:41.948 --> 24:42.982
I saw tire tracks back there

24:43.015 --> 24:44.216
veering off the road.

24:56.963 --> 25:00.733
License plate
matches Jansen's.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.720
Chief Jansen.
Hands where we can see 'em.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.656
LASALLE:
We're NCIS.
You're coming with us.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.157
On your knees.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.827
I can't let this happen.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.195
Why?

25:29.228 --> 25:31.030
'Cause you're innocent?

25:31.063 --> 25:32.799
Hardly.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.207
Got a fugitive loose
in Kisatchie National Park.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.209
He's a Navy SEAL wanted
in connection

26:17.243 --> 26:19.912
with multiple murders. Gonna
need every deputy you can spare.

26:19.946 --> 26:24.083
No. No, Christopher, hold tight
until the cavalry arrives.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.753
Got park rangers and marshals
on the way.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.121
Jansen got a head start.
We wait, he disappears.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.057
You're a good hunter, Chris,
but you're not

26:31.090 --> 26:33.793
100% right now,
and Jansen's in his element.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.628
We already went a few rounds
with him, King.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.263
We know what we're up against,
all right?

26:37.296 --> 26:39.999
King, tell me there's a better
chance of catching Jansen.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.668
Just be careful.
Of course.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.069
We don't want to mangle up
the new girl

26:43.102 --> 26:44.637
on her first big manhunt.

26:44.671 --> 26:47.039
Good news is, he
didn't try to kill us,

26:47.073 --> 26:48.975
which I guess is your job.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.010
When you get back,

26:51.043 --> 26:53.746
I'll let you shoot me
so we're even.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.981
I'll look forward to it.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.616
Mangled, huh?

26:58.350 --> 27:00.753
State police are
sending 30 troopers now.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.989
Won't be enough.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.391
No matter how many men you send.
Mrs. Jansen,

27:05.424 --> 27:06.826
you should be at home.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.661
I can't sit around anymore.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.663
Not with strangers
at my house.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.298
They're MPs.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.834
Waiting to catch my husband.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.003
Which is a waste of time.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.739
He's not
coming back.
Not voluntarily.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.741
Not at all.

27:21.774 --> 27:24.744
Heard those MPs talking
at my house,

27:24.777 --> 27:27.780
calling my husband
a mass murderer.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.682
He won't stand
for that.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.918
And I don't
blame him.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.286
Mrs. Jansen, that's not what...
You don't
understand.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.790
Ryan believes in honor.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.259
To a fault.

27:40.292 --> 27:43.830
He won't be dragged in
on these ridiculous accusations.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.232
He'll die first.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.267
Please,

27:48.300 --> 27:52.138
don't let my husband get killed
out there.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.777
WADE:
While you were hunting SEALs,

27:57.810 --> 28:00.713
I reexamined Petty
Officer Granier.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.349
I found these skin
cells on his wrist.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.384
I assumed they were his,

28:05.417 --> 28:08.387
but analyzed them
just to make sure.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.389
They're not Granier's.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.925
Could be the killer's.
You get DNA?

28:12.959 --> 28:16.495
There's no match in CODIS,
no match to Jansen.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.431
So Jansen didn't
kill Granier.

28:19.465 --> 28:22.735
Which means he likely...
didn't kill Penn.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.304
Oh, my gosh, guys, you're
never gonna believe this.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.373
:
All right. Slowing down.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.309
Breathing. Pausing.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.878
Explaining.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.080
The photos of the massacre
are faked.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.347
Faked?
WADE:
You're sure?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.216
Positive.
Photography's become

28:37.249 --> 28:40.319
a recent interest of mine,
and I had a bit of an insight.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.157
So I blew up the photo to see
if I could make out any details,

28:45.191 --> 28:46.959
and when I did...
Well, here, look--

28:46.993 --> 28:48.527
tell me what you see here.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.362
Image is distorted.
Right, it's called

28:50.396 --> 28:52.531
aberration--
it's the failure of the lens

28:52.564 --> 28:54.333
to produce a true image.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.468
The way the light hits,
everything's just blurry.

28:56.502 --> 28:57.503
Everything except...

28:57.536 --> 28:59.471
our Navy SEAL.
Look at this--

28:59.505 --> 29:02.241
you can make out
all the details
of his insignia,

29:02.274 --> 29:03.342
of his weapon...

29:03.375 --> 29:04.911
He was clearly placed in

29:04.944 --> 29:06.478
after the fact.
BRODY:
Making it seem

29:06.512 --> 29:08.180
as if a SEAL was responsible.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.548
Yeah. I bet you anything
that Penn realized

29:09.581 --> 29:12.384
that this photo was fake...
and he got killed

29:12.418 --> 29:15.387
pursuing whatever it is that
really happened in San Martel.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.958
I'm gonna to go help Patton
get into Penn's files.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.929
What the hell is Jansen up to?

29:27.533 --> 29:30.469
You know, you're wrong.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.872
About me not getting it.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.241
I've had loss.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.244
Maybe not what happened
to you, but...

29:38.277 --> 29:41.580
let's just say there was
someone special, and...

29:41.613 --> 29:43.082
Shh!

29:43.115 --> 29:45.184
Really? I'm opening up.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.552
Broken branch.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.391
Jansen knows better than
to leave a mark like that.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.393
Yeah, he planted it.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.562
And every other sign
we've seen.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.430
He's tracking us.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.266
And that's good how?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.534
We're still not dead,

30:02.568 --> 30:04.370
and he's still not gone.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.372
PATTON:
Like I need help.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.407
Patton, you've been trying
to get into Penn's cloud

30:08.440 --> 30:10.509
for, like, two days.
Dude was deeply paranoid.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.046
I'm talking black-helicopter-
multipliled-by-Area 51 paranoid.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.415
He was a kook.
Whoa, hold on,
I resemble that remark.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.118
Yeah, you do-- that's why I
borrowed your Skep-Kook profile.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.319
Skep

30:20.352 --> 30:21.988
Wait, you stole my identity?

30:22.021 --> 30:24.490
Appropriated, thank you
very much. And it paid off.

30:24.523 --> 30:25.357
Turns out Penn
was preparing

30:25.391 --> 30:27.626
for the day he might die
over a story.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.295
He had a back door
into his files.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.397
Secret encryption key
to gain entry.

30:31.430 --> 30:35.001
Penn left pieces of the key
with various far-flung freaks.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.635
Just got access.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.537
Downloading now.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.572
SEBASTIAN:
Same photos,

30:40.606 --> 30:42.208
but they haven't been doctored.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.411
Wait, what's happening?

30:45.444 --> 30:47.513
The files are disappearing.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.181
Someone's hacking in.
They piggypacked

30:49.215 --> 30:50.416
onto your session.
I'll set up

30:50.449 --> 30:51.583
a firewall, try to download

30:51.617 --> 30:52.551
what hasn't been deleted yet.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.020
Can you track the attack?

30:54.053 --> 30:55.254
I'm tracing it now.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.522
Nobody messes with Patton Plame

30:56.555 --> 30:58.624
in his own house.
I'm calling Pride.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.327
BRODY:
We're heading north
like you told us.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.661
We need this hacker's
exact address.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.531
Working on it. Getting
a bead on the IP's now.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.067
Hurry up,
I'm losing the battle here.
Don't stress me out.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.535
Don't stress you out?
I'm the only thing

31:09.568 --> 31:11.503
standing between some hacker
and all of Penn's files.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.105
We already lost 20%.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.107
Focus, guys.
PATTON: I'm trying.

31:15.141 --> 31:17.009
This guy is good.
Yeah, he's tearing down

31:17.043 --> 31:18.577
every firewall I put up like
it's made out of rice paper.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.113
40% of the files are gone now.
I know, I know!

31:21.147 --> 31:22.581
I'm zooming in on an address.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.350
50% gone.
I need you to head

31:24.383 --> 31:25.617
towards Bayou Road.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.019
Address.
PATTON: Hold on.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.621
70%.
Would you stop saying percent?

31:29.655 --> 31:31.423
Got it--

31:31.457 --> 31:33.625
2523 Bayou Road.
Yes!

31:35.494 --> 31:37.129
Hands up!

31:37.163 --> 31:39.598
Get away from the computer.
Get your hands up now!

31:39.631 --> 31:42.101
It's all right.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.203
We're on the same side.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.672
Nice to see you again,
Agent Pride.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.975
I'm CIA.

32:02.388 --> 32:06.025
BRODY:
Looked into your background,
parts that aren't classified.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.195
Former Army Ranger.
Masters from MIT.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.963
Guess I'm an overachiever.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.999
With a particular
set of skills.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.202
Expert climber.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.537
Means you could
rappel down a building.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.239
Computer specialist.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.308
Means you can hack.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.011
And the organization
Westmar Relief Group.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.013
CIA set it up as a front.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.315
Put you in charge
of Operation Sawback.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.383
You were sent
down to Bolivia to

32:31.417 --> 32:34.153
fight the People's Army.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.322
To look after the locals.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.324
But for some reason,

32:38.357 --> 32:40.392
you became part of the problem.

32:40.426 --> 32:43.395
Wasn't even in country
when that massacre occurred.

32:43.429 --> 32:44.530
But you covered it up.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.532
Fascinating story.

32:46.565 --> 32:49.435
Massacre in San Martel.
Seven men dead.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.470
Tongues cut out.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.540
Real photo.
Fake photo.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.776
The SEAL was put in later.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.411
By you.
We found evidence

32:59.445 --> 33:01.413
on your hard drive
that you doctored these.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.415
Care to explain?

33:03.449 --> 33:05.351
Well, I'd love to, but...

33:05.384 --> 33:07.353
it's compartmented.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.555
In other words, you'd tell us,
but then you'd have to kill us.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.657
PRIDE:
Just like Jonah Penn...

33:11.690 --> 33:13.259
Petty Officer Granier?

33:13.292 --> 33:15.027
Both murdered
because of San Martel.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.562
Tongues cut out
because they knew too much.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.165
Message to the world.
Message to us as well.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.499
Make all signs
point to Jansen.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.501
And just to be sure...

33:22.534 --> 33:25.804
he put a strand of Jansen's hair

33:25.837 --> 33:29.141
in Granier's trunk.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.578
Lot of big talk.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.313
No proof.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.416
We have skin cells

33:37.449 --> 33:39.551
from the man
who killed Granier.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.354
Soon as we get
your DNA back,

33:42.388 --> 33:43.722
we'll make a match

33:43.755 --> 33:47.326
and your time will be up.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.100
Speaking of time...

33:54.133 --> 33:56.435
I haven't checked in
with my colleagues at CIA

33:56.468 --> 33:58.070
since 9:00 a.m.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.306
It'll take 'em
a couple of hours to realize

34:00.339 --> 34:02.074
I'm in your custody.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.776
Then our lawyers
will call yours,

34:04.810 --> 34:08.080
remind them of the CIA mandate
for secrecy.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.116
Until then...

34:11.883 --> 34:13.552
BRODY:
Dalton is right.

34:13.585 --> 34:16.588
CIA will whisk him away
if we don't get Jansen to talk.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.457
We got to find him first,

34:18.490 --> 34:20.559
figure out if he's a witness
or an accomplice.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.428
Oh, I got it. I so got it.

34:22.461 --> 34:24.563
So I took a deeper look
at those undoctored photos

34:24.596 --> 34:25.864
from the massacre.
Which, by the way--

34:25.897 --> 34:27.633
taken with top-notch
equipment. I mean,

34:27.666 --> 34:29.435
these contrast
on these things...

34:29.468 --> 34:31.570
Regardless, I've been
studying them up close,

34:31.603 --> 34:33.605
and I'm 99% sure I can
identify the person

34:33.639 --> 34:35.807
responsible
for the massacre in Bolivia.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.509
Did you get an angle
on the killer's face?

34:37.543 --> 34:38.810
No, something better.
I-I got a fingerprint.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.479
From a photograph?

34:40.512 --> 34:44.350
Yeah, first I found this bloody
thumbprint on the neck.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.185
Here I just zoomed in
and I ran it through AFIS.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.420
Get a hit?
Yeah, it's coming up now.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.422
There it is.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.559
There's the guy
responsible.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.796
Christopher.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.599
Chief Petty Officer
Ryan Jansen!

35:02.234 --> 35:03.335
Come out!

35:03.369 --> 35:04.736
We need to talk!

35:04.770 --> 35:06.772
It's safe for you now!

35:08.940 --> 35:11.443
We know that you
didn't kill Penn!

35:11.477 --> 35:12.878
Or Granier!

35:12.911 --> 35:15.247
We just don't know
why you're running!

35:17.316 --> 35:19.418
How do I know you weren't
sent to kill me?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.920
If that was the case,
you'd be dead by now.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.422
Give it
your best shot.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.690
Suicide by cop?

35:24.723 --> 35:26.358
Is that what you want?

35:26.392 --> 35:27.726
Just do what
you're gonna do already.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.597
Okay.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.504
How about
let's talk.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.174
You, too, Percy.
No way.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.343
Look, I'm your training agent.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.612
He's still got a gun.
There's nothing in the manual

35:46.645 --> 35:49.648
about disarming myself
in front of an armed fugitive.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.117
This isn't in the manual.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.956
Like I said,
Jansen,

35:57.989 --> 36:00.492
we know you didn't kill Penn
or Granier.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.827
And there's proof
exonerating you

36:01.860 --> 36:03.629
from the massacre
at San Martel.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.464
Doesn't mean I'm not guilty.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.832
Operation Sawback.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.868
Mission was protect the locals,
dismantle the PA.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.937
Something happened.
The massacre.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.207
Men who were cooperating
with us brutally executed.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.943
The next day Granier and I
are pulled for an extraction op.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.678
Who were you extracting?

36:19.711 --> 36:21.880
Some local-- they said
if we left him behind

36:21.913 --> 36:23.782
that he'd get killed
like the rest,

36:23.815 --> 36:25.351
so we got him
to safety.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.818
Well, mission
accomplished.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.754
Yeah. Then last week,
Penn calls.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.257
He's got sources in Bolivia.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.891
Found out
who we really extracted.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.693
El Hacha.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.795
Leader of the
People's Army.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.930
He killed those men
in San Martel.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.500
Who ordered you to extract?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.802
A guy named Dalton

36:43.835 --> 36:46.605
Yeah. Spook.
I don't know the name.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.806
Well, we got the guy.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.742
You come with us,
you can identify him.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.744
And then what?

36:52.778 --> 36:54.880
Then I just live
the rest of my life

36:54.913 --> 36:56.915
knowing that I freed
a mass murderer?

36:56.948 --> 36:59.518
Brought him
to this county?

36:59.551 --> 37:01.520
How do I deal with that?

37:01.553 --> 37:03.789
Explain that to Emily?

37:03.822 --> 37:07.426
So you want
to restore your honor?

37:07.459 --> 37:08.960
You can do that.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.762
Just come in with us

37:10.796 --> 37:12.831
and bring El Hacha to justice.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.666
All you have to do

37:14.700 --> 37:16.868
is drop your weapon.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.716
Hey, hey.
Remember me?

37:34.853 --> 37:36.455
Okay.
I got it.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.758
Bad temper you've
got there, Baco.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.627
My guess is it's
gotten you into trouble

37:41.660 --> 37:43.762
in the past.
San Martel, for instance?

37:43.795 --> 37:45.431
The seven men you killed?

37:45.464 --> 37:47.966
Right, El Hacha?

37:53.839 --> 37:56.308
BRODY:
Curious,
what's the going rate

37:56.342 --> 37:58.744
to bribe a CIA operative
these days, huh?

37:58.777 --> 38:02.080
Dalton forced me.
I wanted none of it.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.683
He made me kill those men.
It was all him.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.786
That's what Dalton's just told
the U.S. Attorney about you.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.855
Gonna be fun watching you two
eat each other alive.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.667
That leaves one
more thing to do.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.502
What's that?

38:24.770 --> 38:26.772
Better than a postcard.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.107
* Jan lays down
and wrestles in her sleep *

38:31.109 --> 38:33.044
You all right?

38:33.078 --> 38:36.582
Hey, Em.

38:36.615 --> 38:41.420
* An old friend calls
and tells us where to meet *

38:41.453 --> 38:44.390
* Her plane takes off
from Baltimore *

38:44.423 --> 38:46.858
* And touches down
on Bourbon Street *

38:46.892 --> 38:51.029
* Ooh... ooh...

38:51.062 --> 38:54.966
* Ooh...

38:55.000 --> 38:57.736
* We sit outside
and argue all night long *

38:57.769 --> 39:00.806
Smooth motions,
remember?

39:00.839 --> 39:03.008
Keep a rhythm.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.746
Appreciate you...

39:07.779 --> 39:10.782
wantin' to talk about, you know,

39:10.816 --> 39:12.751
the one you lost.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.586
* And happy with
her full-time job... *

39:14.620 --> 39:16.522
Okay.

39:16.555 --> 39:17.923
And as
for Sheila,

39:17.956 --> 39:19.391
the banker lady,

39:19.425 --> 39:20.859
she's a goof.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.628
Makes me laugh.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.396
Well, laughing is good.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.899
It is for me, now.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.901
Well, for the record,

39:29.935 --> 39:32.571
you know, you make me laugh.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.808
But just 'cause of your looks.
Ha, ha.

39:39.144 --> 39:42.047
Spoke to the U.S. attorney.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.916
CIA is wiping their hands
clean of Dalton.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.019
He's going away
for a long time.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.888
What'd you
bring us, King?
Well,

39:49.921 --> 39:51.957
shrimp po'boy for you.
Nice.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.793
And me. Veggie deluxe
for Sonja.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.061
Thank you.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.530
Hey.

40:00.532 --> 40:01.767
That bar looks nice.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.935
Yeah, a little
elbow grease.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.971
Seriously?

40:06.004 --> 40:11.443
* If I die
before I learn to speak *

40:11.477 --> 40:14.212
* Can money pay for all
the days I lived awake *

40:14.245 --> 40:15.814
* But half asleep?

40:15.847 --> 40:18.216
Hey.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.885
That Penn's article?

40:19.918 --> 40:21.887
Yeah, I was able
to get it online.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.822
We've already got thousands
of hits.

40:23.855 --> 40:27.493
Even in death,
man has a voice.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.928
Oh. About your photos.

40:29.961 --> 40:33.231
Uh, I'm still workin' on 'em,
but, uh, I'll get there.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.902
Well, after what you did
for Penn, I have no doubt.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.838
Thanks, Sebastian.
Yeah.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.507
*

41:00.926 --> 41:04.796
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Louisiana anymore.
