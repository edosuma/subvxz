00:01.051 --> 00:02.985
Previously on Fringe:

00:03.153 --> 00:04.780
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

00:04.954 --> 00:06.854
They're calling these events the Pattern.

00:07.023 --> 00:08.991
As if someone out there
is experimenting...

00:09.159 --> 00:10.888
...only the whole world is their lab.

00:11.294 --> 00:14.354
- Anybody you need you can have.
- His name's Walter Bishop.

00:14.531 --> 00:16.624
- My father.
- He worked out of Harvard.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.361
He was part of a classified U.S. Army
experimental program...

00:20.537 --> 00:22.937
...in an area called fringe science.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.836
You're telling me
my father was Dr. Frankenstein?

00:26.276 --> 00:29.109
So much happened here,
and so much is about to.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:53.770 --> 00:56.136
Are those notes you're writing, Ben?

00:58.341 --> 00:59.865
I thought we talked about this.

01:00.043 --> 01:02.705
You know... About taking a break
from the music.

01:03.646 --> 01:06.171
So you'd have time for other things.

01:08.118 --> 01:10.052
Maybe something new.

01:12.555 --> 01:14.785
Dad? Don't get mad at me...

01:14.958 --> 01:20.624
...but the windshield wipers,
can you slow them down?

01:20.797 --> 01:22.287
Slow them down?

01:22.699 --> 01:26.100
The tempo. It's messing me up.

01:27.370 --> 01:30.965
Sorry, Bean, I can't.
I need to be able to see.

01:38.715 --> 01:40.376
Stop! I need help!

01:42.485 --> 01:45.579
- What is it?
- I don't know. Let's see.

01:55.064 --> 01:58.591
- You okay?
- I'm fine. I can't say the same for my car.

01:58.768 --> 02:01.532
It shuddered and then stopped,
and my phone's dead.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.865
Oh, hold on. Be right back.

02:06.810 --> 02:08.003
- Thank you.
- Of course.

02:08.178 --> 02:10.407
Not a night
you wanna get stuck out here.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.680
Yeah, I need a tow.

02:14.851 --> 02:18.582
I'm on Route 12
about two miles north of Fair Oak.

02:20.523 --> 02:25.893
Yeah. Massachusetts plate, 332 EWD.

02:26.496 --> 02:27.793
All right, thanks.

02:27.964 --> 02:30.432
They're busy. It's gonna be a while.

02:30.767 --> 02:34.396
Now I'm definitely gonna be late
to that meeting. This one's important.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.337
Listen, I know hardly a thing about cars,
but why don't you let me take a look?

02:38.508 --> 02:40.738
- No, you've done enough. No.
- It's all right.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.749
Transmission's dry.

02:55.825 --> 02:57.486
Some kind of electrical short.

03:16.679 --> 03:19.045
Hey, easy. Didn't mean to scare you.

03:19.482 --> 03:21.450
It's okay. I didn't... I didn't hear you.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.609
Yeah, listen, sorry it took so long.

03:24.854 --> 03:27.118
- Hey, man, you okay?
- Where's her car?

03:30.894 --> 03:32.452
Ben?

03:33.029 --> 03:34.519
Ben?

03:35.965 --> 03:37.227
Ben!

03:38.835 --> 03:40.200
Ben!

04:05.561 --> 04:07.324
The boy's name is Ben Stockton.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.125
According to his father,
they were driving home...

04:10.300 --> 04:12.495
...when he saw a woman
having car trouble.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.604
Claims that while he was looking at the car,
something happened.

04:15.772 --> 04:17.329
Said it was like time jumped...

04:17.507 --> 04:20.476
...and his son, the woman
and her car were suddenly gone.

04:20.642 --> 04:21.769
So he just blacked out.

04:21.945 --> 04:25.244
In the statement he gave,
he insisted he never lost consciousness.

04:25.415 --> 04:27.110
Any witnesses to back up the story?

04:27.283 --> 04:29.774
No. But this is not the first time
this has happened.

04:30.753 --> 04:34.450
These are from the files of three
missing-person cases dating back 10 years.

04:34.624 --> 04:37.616
In each one, witnesses described
seeing the same woman.

04:37.794 --> 04:39.989
We've tried running
facial-recognition software.

04:40.163 --> 04:42.654
- Nothing.
- So, what happened to the other victims?

04:42.832 --> 04:45.801
The first was found wandering
the I-91 near Northampton.

04:45.969 --> 04:48.631
The second, in a supermarket
curled up in the freezer bin.

04:48.805 --> 04:50.898
- Meaning what? They were let go?
- Apparently.

04:51.074 --> 04:53.634
But not before whatever had been done
drove them insane.

04:53.810 --> 04:55.778
After she was found, one of the victims...

04:55.945 --> 04:58.880
...actually tried to lobotomize herself
using a butter knife.

04:59.048 --> 05:02.711
And all of them incapable of recalling
what happened during the abduction.

05:02.885 --> 05:03.943
Even under hypnosis.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.678
So they were all academics.

05:05.855 --> 05:08.585
A probability theorist,
structural engineer...

05:08.758 --> 05:11.192
If we're looking at a serial abduction...

05:11.361 --> 05:13.488
...then a 10-year-old kid
doesn't fit the bill.

05:13.663 --> 05:18.191
No. But other than that,
the details are identical to the others.

05:18.368 --> 05:22.134
Interacting with the woman in the sketch,
then experiencing lost time.

05:22.305 --> 05:23.465
Peculiar flashing lights.

05:24.941 --> 05:27.569
Green, green, green, red.
Like Christmas lights.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.837
How did you know that, Dr. Bishop?

05:30.013 --> 05:31.605
I don't know.

05:32.348 --> 05:35.078
- But that's what happened, isn't it?
- Yes.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.515
Think you might be able
to jog your mind, Walter?

05:37.687 --> 05:38.745
Could be helpful.

05:38.921 --> 05:42.186
Christmas lights.
That's all I can recall. Sorry.

05:47.697 --> 05:51.098
I know what it sounds like.
Like I'm crazy. I'm not.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.929
I talked to her. I touched her car.

05:54.103 --> 05:57.300
The police grilled my brother for hours.
Treated him like a suspect.

05:57.473 --> 06:00.101
- I know what I saw.
- Why doesn't anybody believe him?

06:00.276 --> 06:02.642
We're wasting time. We need to find Ben.

06:02.812 --> 06:04.541
I believe you.

06:04.714 --> 06:08.445
In fact, we think the same woman
may be involved in other abductions.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.880
This has happened before?

06:10.053 --> 06:11.987
Why would anyone wanna take my son?

06:12.155 --> 06:15.989
I don't know. Honestly, he doesn't really
fit the profile of the other victims.

06:16.159 --> 06:17.786
For one, they were all adults.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.155
And another, they were all academics.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.296
Experts in various fields.

06:25.868 --> 06:27.062
What?

06:27.670 --> 06:30.901
Ben is kind of an expert himself.

06:31.074 --> 06:32.735
What do you mean?

06:33.609 --> 06:37.136
Nine months ago,
my wife was walking Ben to school.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.714
Some idiot late for a dentist appointment
ran a red light.

06:41.384 --> 06:43.545
And they were hit in a crosswalk.

06:44.587 --> 06:46.111
Abby was killed.

06:46.289 --> 06:49.156
The doctors didn't know
if Ben was gonna make it either.

06:49.325 --> 06:54.422
He was in a coma for six days,
and when he woke up...

06:55.264 --> 06:57.323
It's easier if I just show you.

07:12.315 --> 07:15.113
This is the day
I took him home from the hospital.

07:16.452 --> 07:21.048
He hadn't spoken, said even a word
since I told him his mother died.

07:21.357 --> 07:25.555
Then we got home, and he just sat down
at the piano and started to play.

07:27.063 --> 07:28.963
He's very talented.

07:29.732 --> 07:32.963
Before this,
he had never taken a single lesson.

07:33.136 --> 07:37.470
Doctors told me there have been cases,
people with severe brain traumas...

07:37.640 --> 07:41.269
...waking up with the ability
to do things they'd never done before.

07:42.245 --> 07:45.578
Two weeks later,
he was composing his own music.

07:46.182 --> 07:48.446
One piece in particular.

07:49.318 --> 07:52.219
He stopped being interested
in everything else.

07:53.022 --> 07:58.324
You said the other people that had been
taken were accomplished at something.

07:58.494 --> 08:00.485
Do you think that
that's why they took Ben?

08:00.663 --> 08:02.392
I don't know.

08:09.805 --> 08:11.363
Thank you so much for your time.

08:11.541 --> 08:13.406
Agent Dunham?

08:15.678 --> 08:18.613
After Abby died, my brother...

08:19.515 --> 08:22.245
...he barely held it together.

08:23.219 --> 08:26.916
Without Ben, I don't think he'll make it.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.250
I'll do everything I can.

08:46.242 --> 08:47.937
How are you feeling, Ben?

08:51.581 --> 08:53.048
I wanna go home.

08:53.216 --> 08:54.911
I just wanna see my dad.

08:59.021 --> 09:01.012
Well, I have something better for you.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.715
There's someone else here
who would like to see you.

09:03.893 --> 09:05.190
I don't care!

09:05.361 --> 09:07.454
I wanna see my dad.

09:07.763 --> 09:10.891
Oh, well, your mother
will be very disappointed to hear that.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.462
My mom's dead.

09:14.770 --> 09:17.136
Are you sure about that?

09:29.986 --> 09:31.647
Hey, Walter?

09:31.821 --> 09:34.415
Don't you think it's early
for the yuletide cheer?

09:34.590 --> 09:37.320
I'm reciting Christmas carols
in an attempt...

09:37.493 --> 09:41.896
...to jar loose some details
from my subconscious...

09:42.064 --> 09:45.556
...to remember where I heard mention
of the green and red lights.

09:45.735 --> 09:49.000
But sadly it hasn't yet worked.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.969
So you thought it would be useful
to work on decorations?

09:52.141 --> 09:55.838
Though I can't recall
where I heard of the lights...

09:56.012 --> 10:00.108
...it did give me an idea,
a theory as to how the boy was taken.

10:00.283 --> 10:06.711
I was hired to design a technology,
an intricate pattern of flashing lights...

10:06.889 --> 10:09.949
...intended to create
a suggestible state of hypnosis.

10:10.126 --> 10:14.324
Theoretically, the test subjects
would do whatever commanded.

10:14.497 --> 10:17.864
Bark like a dog, dance a jig, wash the car.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.366
The government
had you working on mind control?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.830
Not the government.

10:23.005 --> 10:25.269
It was an advertising agency.

10:25.441 --> 10:29.878
They hoped to broadcast
the flashing lights during commercials...

10:30.046 --> 10:34.642
...so that the viewers would have
no choice but to buy their products.

10:34.817 --> 10:38.218
Unfortunately, it merely caused nausea...

10:38.387 --> 10:42.619
...which was unfortunate because
apparently people don't like to shop...

10:42.792 --> 10:45.659
...when they feel like
they're going to throw up.

10:46.028 --> 10:48.155
Miss, where is the remote?!

10:48.331 --> 10:53.633
Oh, hey. Walter. Walter. Walter.
Dial it down a notch, all right?

10:54.937 --> 10:59.237
I posit that the flashing lights
witnessed by the father...

10:59.408 --> 11:01.968
...induced a hypnagogic trance...

11:02.144 --> 11:04.544
...during which stage
the child was abducted.

11:04.714 --> 11:07.148
- You said the experiments were failures.
- Oh, yes.

11:07.316 --> 11:11.412
But I focused solely on the timing
and intensity of the flashes...

11:11.587 --> 11:13.782
...not the colors. The green and red.

11:13.956 --> 11:18.052
Now, I suggest that those wavelengths
are the key to success.

11:18.227 --> 11:20.161
Come. Let me demonstrate. Come.

11:23.933 --> 11:28.734
- What do you want me to do?
- Now just stare at the lights.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.038
Sorry, Walter, better luck next time.

12:04.206 --> 12:06.538
Anyone ready for lunch?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.970
What's up, Chachi?

12:12.314 --> 12:13.679
Did you do this to me?

12:15.785 --> 12:16.809
You did.

12:22.591 --> 12:23.922
- Dunham.
- It's me.

12:24.093 --> 12:27.153
Based on the description by the father,
I ID'd your kidnapper.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.660
Name's Joanne Ostler.

12:28.831 --> 12:33.131
She was a neurologist studying at MIT.
She would have been 30 this March.

12:33.302 --> 12:36.601
- What do you mean, "would have been"?
- According to DMV records...

12:36.772 --> 12:38.740
...Joanne Ostler died 10 years ago.

12:38.908 --> 12:40.341
Are you sure?

12:40.509 --> 12:42.773
Looks identical to the woman
from your sketch.

12:42.945 --> 12:44.606
She doesn't have a twin. I checked.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.008
So, what happened to her?

12:46.182 --> 12:49.379
Apparently her car went off the bridge
in November of '98...

12:49.552 --> 12:52.350
...eight months before
any of the abductions.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.783
How is that even possible?

12:53.956 --> 12:57.289
Here's the thing. The car was recovered,
but the body was never found.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.553
So then it's possible that she survived.

12:59.728 --> 13:04.062
Either that,
or Broyles has you chasing a ghost.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.904
Hey. What the hell's he doing?

13:12.074 --> 13:14.872
It'll help him remember
where he's heard about the lights.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.068
- Okay.
- We've got news.

13:16.245 --> 13:17.906
We understand how Ben was abducted.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.447
Those flashing lights, they put
the father into a hypnagogic state.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.945
We think we may have ID'd
the woman responsible.

13:24.119 --> 13:25.177
I have it.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.024
Christmas. Christmas.

13:29.191 --> 13:32.627
Leading to Christmas carols,
one of which is "Jingle Bells."

13:32.795 --> 13:35.320
Which leads naturally to
"dashing through the snow."

13:35.498 --> 13:38.296
Which of course inevitably
leads one to "dash."

13:38.467 --> 13:41.368
- To "dash"?
- Dashiell Kim.

13:41.537 --> 13:43.937
The man who mentioned
the lights to me. I'm sure.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.572
Where is he, Walter? Can we talk to him?

13:46.742 --> 13:49.210
I guess that would depend on whether...

13:49.378 --> 13:51.642
...he has succeeded in
killing himself or not.

13:52.181 --> 13:54.775
What are talking about, Walter?
Who is this guy?

13:54.950 --> 13:58.977
A fellow inmate of mine
at St. Claire's asylum.

14:00.789 --> 14:04.691
I think we may have ID'd
another abductee. Dashiell Kim.

14:04.860 --> 14:08.091
Headed up Astrophysics at U-Mass.
Went missing in May 2006.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.165
Turned up a week later
at his home outside Clarksburg...

14:11.333 --> 14:13.324
...where he had a psychotic break...

14:13.502 --> 14:15.800
...bludgeoned his wife to death
with a tire iron.

14:15.971 --> 14:18.098
He was committed
to St. Claire's Hospital.

14:19.842 --> 14:23.835
- He was there at the same time as Bishop?
- Walter remembers Kim telling him a story...

14:24.013 --> 14:26.777
...about a woman who put him to sleep
with a Christmas tree.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.213
- And then took him away.
- Green and red lights.

14:29.385 --> 14:30.613
And he fits the profile.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.651
Expert in a scientific field.

14:33.222 --> 14:36.089
I need you to get an interview request
pushed through legal...

14:36.258 --> 14:38.192
...so that we can arrange a visitation.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.557
Any specific things that Kim
might remember about the abduction...

14:41.730 --> 14:44.460
...like where he was taken maybe.
- That might take time.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.534
- How come?
- Says here Dashiell Kim is a 10-27.

14:47.703 --> 14:50.604
- And what's that?
- Ten-27:

14:51.173 --> 14:53.641
Criminally insane
with knowledge of state secrets.

14:53.809 --> 14:58.337
Apparently Kim had a sideline
consulting on defense contracts for JPL.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.078
You can't talk to him
without official clearance.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.615
And how long will that take?

15:03.085 --> 15:06.020
If we go through channels?
Six weeks minimum.

15:06.188 --> 15:09.419
I've got a contact at Justice.
I'll tell him it's urgent.

15:17.132 --> 15:19.930
I don't know how a guy
that can do this to his own wife...

15:20.102 --> 15:22.935
...is gonna help you find that missing kid.

15:54.470 --> 15:57.564
You've never looked at it
in that order, have you?

16:02.945 --> 16:04.469
No.

16:05.514 --> 16:07.482
Hi, Bean.

16:08.951 --> 16:10.316
Mom?

16:13.489 --> 16:14.979
Mom.

16:26.335 --> 16:28.667
He did this to his own wife.

16:29.271 --> 16:32.934
Thirty-two years of marriage.
By all accounts, they seemed happy.

16:33.609 --> 16:37.340
Until Dashiell showed up after
he was abducted and beat her to death.

16:37.513 --> 16:39.640
Did I hear mention
of my old friend Dashiell?

16:43.485 --> 16:44.747
Of course.

16:45.187 --> 16:47.587
I'd recognize his handiwork anywhere.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.950
You mean he killed others?

16:51.560 --> 16:55.826
Well, he tried.
A patient at the institution, Jasper.

16:55.998 --> 16:58.728
But actually,
I was referring to the equation.

16:58.901 --> 17:00.368
Dashiell was obsessed with it.

17:01.003 --> 17:03.904
- Obsessed in what way?
- He couldn't complete it.

17:04.073 --> 17:08.976
I tried to help him solve it once,
and he came at me with a plastic spork.

17:17.419 --> 17:18.681
What are you thinking?

17:19.121 --> 17:23.490
Ben's father said that Ben became
obsessed with this one piece of music.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.490
And he couldn't complete it either.

17:25.828 --> 17:27.954
I've been listening to it.
It's very beautiful.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.724
He's light-years ahead
of where you were at that age.

17:30.899 --> 17:33.026
Walter, take a look at this.
See this function?

17:33.202 --> 17:35.568
It appears here, here.

17:35.738 --> 17:39.174
- It just keeps repeating over and over.
- Yes, yes. A recurring expression.

17:39.341 --> 17:40.706
Or it's a rhythm.

17:40.876 --> 17:43.344
Well, yes, I suppose.

17:44.613 --> 17:45.637
Are you suggesting...?

17:45.814 --> 17:48.305
Can you convert that
into standard musical notation?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.641
Oh, I can try.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.253
- What's going on?
- Music is a mathematical language.

17:53.422 --> 17:54.753
Chords have numerical values.

17:54.923 --> 17:57.721
The notes... Quarters, 8ths, 16ths
are fractions, variables.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.986
I took the oboe for six months
and then quit.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.657
Almost there, Peter. Okay.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.159
Just nine bars.

18:07.469 --> 18:08.663
Okay, listen to this.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.353
Sound familiar?

18:27.222 --> 18:28.553
That's Ben's song.

18:28.891 --> 18:33.294
Yes, Ben's piece
is the musical equivalent...

18:33.462 --> 18:36.522
...of Dashiell's mathematical formula.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.360
How is that possible?
They'd never even met each other.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.698
It's not so surprising, actually.

18:42.871 --> 18:46.102
Curious minds often converge
on the same idea.

18:46.275 --> 18:48.641
Newton and Leibnitz independently...

18:48.811 --> 18:51.473
...without knowing each other,
invented calculus.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.914
The relevant question is, what is it?

18:55.083 --> 18:56.311
What is what?

18:56.485 --> 18:59.613
What is it that both Ben and Dashiell
are trying to solve?

18:59.788 --> 19:03.121
How is this possible? Are we in heaven?

19:03.292 --> 19:05.123
No, honey. We're not in heaven.

19:05.527 --> 19:09.463
But I don't understand.

19:09.798 --> 19:11.265
I saw you get hurt.

19:11.433 --> 19:14.891
I don't understand either,
but I do know that I'm here...

19:15.070 --> 19:17.561
...and that I've missed you
so much, Bean.

19:17.739 --> 19:21.072
For me to stay,
you have to do what this woman says.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.972
You have to finish the song, Bean.

19:23.145 --> 19:25.511
You need to finish it.

19:27.282 --> 19:29.648
It's important, Ben.

19:33.288 --> 19:34.949
Okay.

19:35.958 --> 19:37.186
I love you, Mom.

19:38.961 --> 19:41.725
I love you too, Bean.

19:48.904 --> 19:50.531
- Dr. Sumner.
- Hello.

19:50.706 --> 19:53.038
Thank you so much
for taking time to speak with me.

19:53.208 --> 19:56.507
I understand you're interested in talking
to one of my patients.

19:56.678 --> 20:01.172
Although I can't imagine what help
Dashiell Kim could be to the FBI.

20:01.350 --> 20:04.251
We're investigating
a missing-persons case. A kidnapping.

20:04.419 --> 20:06.250
We believe that, before coming here...

20:06.421 --> 20:08.889
...Mr. Kim may have been the victim
of an abduction...

20:09.057 --> 20:11.651
...possibly by the same person
that we're looking for.

20:12.594 --> 20:16.963
I suppose you came by this information
through a former patient of mine.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.032
A Dr. Walter Bishop?

20:19.835 --> 20:22.531
You're the agent who took him
three months ago, aren't you?

20:22.704 --> 20:26.765
Yes. And you should know Dr. Bishop
is doing quite well.

20:26.942 --> 20:29.172
He's been assisting us
since he checked out.

20:29.344 --> 20:34.179
He has no business being out
among the rest of us.

20:36.952 --> 20:38.249
I appreciate your concern...

20:38.420 --> 20:40.479
...but I'm not here
to talk about Dr. Bishop.

20:41.023 --> 20:45.392
I respect your discretion,
provided you respect mine.

20:45.560 --> 20:49.724
The mental health of my patients
is my primary concern.

20:49.898 --> 20:53.732
And subjecting them to open-ended
interrogations by FBI agents...

20:53.902 --> 20:56.200
...is hardly prudent therapy.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.307
I appreciate your position.

21:00.876 --> 21:02.707
And I'd like to help.

21:02.878 --> 21:06.541
But I can't subject Dashiell
to new faces right now.

21:07.149 --> 21:11.245
Dr. Sumner, I'm here because
a child's life may be in danger.

21:15.290 --> 21:17.690
There may be a way
we can work this out.

21:19.094 --> 21:20.118
I'm listening.

21:20.295 --> 21:25.198
You've assured me that Walter Bishop
is doing fine.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.965
If that's the case...

21:28.236 --> 21:33.139
...I'll allow Walter Bishop
to talk to Mr. Kim...

21:33.875 --> 21:36.241
...and ask your questions.

21:36.745 --> 21:40.078
It might do Dashiell good
to see a familiar face.

21:46.088 --> 21:47.885
Olivia, there's nothing to discuss.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.524
But it's the only way
we can make contact with Kim.

21:50.692 --> 21:52.387
- Absolutely not.
- Peter...

21:52.561 --> 21:55.826
You want to send my mentally
unstable father back to the institution...

21:55.998 --> 21:58.466
...that made him that way.
- We don't have a choice.

21:58.633 --> 21:59.964
We need to speak to Dashiell.

22:00.135 --> 22:02.399
Without Sumner's permission,
we need a subpoena...

22:02.571 --> 22:05.131
...which will take time.
- Even if he speaks to him...

22:05.307 --> 22:07.400
...what makes you think
he'll remember a word?

22:07.576 --> 22:09.510
He can't remember
what he had for lunch.

22:09.678 --> 22:15.583
I have noticed that you have a habit
of referring to me as if I'm not in the room.

22:17.219 --> 22:19.050
Does anyone care what I think?

22:19.221 --> 22:23.055
Yes, Walter. What do you want to do?

22:24.393 --> 22:26.520
I'd rather not go.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.294
- Walter...
- Olivia, he said no.

22:29.898 --> 22:32.059
That is incorrect.

22:32.234 --> 22:35.135
I said I'd rather not go.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.501
But I will.

22:40.075 --> 22:42.805
Every moment that passes...

22:42.978 --> 22:47.244
...is another moment
that little boy's life is in danger.

22:48.984 --> 22:53.421
Isn't that correct, Agent Dunham?

22:54.089 --> 22:57.581
- Mm-hm.
- Then we should go.

23:51.713 --> 23:53.544
Well, are you ready?

23:56.585 --> 23:58.746
When you get out, we'll be right here.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.820
Good luck, Walter.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.846
Come with me.

24:57.946 --> 25:01.973
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't help you.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.982
Dr. Bishop. How you been?

25:12.493 --> 25:15.121
You know I'm not really back.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.787
Yeah, well, it's nice to see you anyway.

25:17.966 --> 25:20.298
You have ten minutes, Walter.

25:36.351 --> 25:40.048
Dashiell. It's me, Walter.

25:41.222 --> 25:43.156
Walter Bishop.

25:49.430 --> 25:50.454
Walter?

25:56.037 --> 25:57.504
You look different.

25:57.672 --> 26:00.368
Oh, yeah. It's the beard.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.372
And you look different too somehow.

26:04.545 --> 26:06.740
That smile.

26:08.883 --> 26:13.547
Have they altered your medication?
Wouldn't surprise me.

26:13.955 --> 26:17.482
These medieval quacks
are more proficient at phrenology...

26:17.659 --> 26:19.752
...than psychopharmacology.

26:22.397 --> 26:24.831
I miss your jokes, Walter.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.528
And I miss your stories.

26:28.970 --> 26:32.770
The one about the woman
who took you away...

26:33.141 --> 26:36.076
...with the green and red lights and...

26:36.577 --> 26:37.601
Dashiell, look at me.

26:38.079 --> 26:39.910
This is important.

26:40.081 --> 26:44.108
The woman.
Where exactly did she take you?

26:45.119 --> 26:47.110
I'm sorry.

26:47.855 --> 26:51.188
I don't know what you're referring to.

26:51.559 --> 26:54.027
You must be mistaking me
for someone else.

26:54.195 --> 26:57.096
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I want to sit here...

26:57.265 --> 27:00.860
...and finish my butterscotch pudding
in peace.

27:17.452 --> 27:18.942
Hey.

27:28.629 --> 27:32.429
You were always trying to solve it.

27:39.173 --> 27:40.765
Yes.

27:43.544 --> 27:46.672
I don't do math anymore, Walter.

27:47.115 --> 27:50.983
Mathematical formulations are
not conducive to my mental stability.

27:51.152 --> 27:55.589
That's fine.
But if you recognize the equation...

27:55.757 --> 27:58.885
...do you not remember the woman
with the red and green lights...

27:59.060 --> 28:02.257
...where she took you...?
- I don't do math anymore!

28:10.872 --> 28:12.931
You used to tell me the story all the time.

28:13.107 --> 28:14.768
- I don't know!
- You drove me crazy.

28:14.942 --> 28:17.376
- I don't do math anymore.
- I don't care about math.

28:17.545 --> 28:20.844
- Dr. Bishop, please.
- No, I need to know where she took you.

28:21.015 --> 28:22.505
That's enough. It's time to go.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.014
- Where is she?
- I've got him.

28:30.191 --> 28:33.024
Please, Dashiell, tell me where she is.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.953
What do you mean, you sedated him?
Walter is legally in my custody.

28:37.131 --> 28:38.792
You have no right to keep him here.

28:38.966 --> 28:41.025
Not only do I have every right
to hold him...

28:41.202 --> 28:44.330
...I have a responsibility to hold him.
He accosted Mr. Kim.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.530
If I release him and something happens...

28:46.707 --> 28:48.800
I can assure you
that's not going to happen.

28:48.976 --> 28:52.241
- He's under our supervision.
- Perhaps that compounded the problem.

28:52.413 --> 28:54.108
Meaning what?

28:56.250 --> 29:00.050
I had some time to talk to Dr. Bishop
after he calmed down...

29:00.221 --> 29:01.984
...about his work assisting you.

29:02.156 --> 29:06.024
And it is clear that exposing him
to the pressures of criminal investigations...

29:06.194 --> 29:11.461
...while indulging
his fantastical pseudoscientific notions...

29:11.632 --> 29:15.659
...has exacerbated the worst features
of his mental illness.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.202
- Really?
- Really.

29:17.371 --> 29:19.271
After what I saw the last three months...

29:19.440 --> 29:21.908
...he strikes me
as one of the sanest people I know.

29:22.076 --> 29:24.567
- Is that so?
- I'm gonna make this really simple.

29:25.012 --> 29:27.446
Walter is assisting us
in a criminal investigation...

29:27.615 --> 29:29.014
...which you are obstructing.

29:29.183 --> 29:32.778
So either you release him into our custody
or I will get a court order.

29:33.588 --> 29:35.522
You go get your court order, then.

30:08.422 --> 30:11.414
Welcome back, Walter.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.479
Where are we on that tip from Rochester?

30:35.650 --> 30:38.175
Agents are heading to the store
where they saw the boy.

30:38.352 --> 30:41.116
They're hoping video surveillance
can confirm it was Ben.

30:41.289 --> 30:43.154
Okay. Well, have we set up checkpoints?

30:43.324 --> 30:44.951
No, they're on it. So far nothing.

30:45.126 --> 30:48.562
I have the General Counsel's office
on the phone. It's about Dr. Bishop.

30:48.729 --> 30:50.560
This is Agent Dunham.

30:52.567 --> 30:56.333
No, I wanted you
to work around the protocol.

30:57.071 --> 30:59.869
Please, I need your help.
I need to get Bishop out.

31:02.343 --> 31:04.641
Okay, 7 a.m.

31:04.812 --> 31:06.439
- Thank you.
- What was that?

31:06.614 --> 31:09.378
We have to wait till morning
to have Walter released.

31:09.550 --> 31:11.643
- Then he's out?
- I promise, and I'm sorry...

31:11.819 --> 31:13.787
...and obviously, you were right.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.513
No, this was Walter's choice.

31:16.524 --> 31:18.719
Okay, so if you wanna go down
to reception...

31:18.893 --> 31:21.828
...someone can arrange a ride,
and then at least one of us...

31:21.996 --> 31:23.725
...can get some sleep.

31:23.898 --> 31:26.230
The woman who abducted Ben,
Joanne Ostler...

31:26.400 --> 31:29.028
...up until now,
everybody thought she was dead, right?

31:29.203 --> 31:32.695
She's been walking around for 10 years.
Must be using somebody's name.

31:32.873 --> 31:34.841
We didn't get any hits on an alias search.

31:35.009 --> 31:37.409
- What did you base the search on?
- On the anagrams.

31:37.578 --> 31:39.876
Like, combinations
of different family names.

31:40.047 --> 31:41.378
It's what most people use.

31:41.549 --> 31:44.074
Thanks, I know that.
I've done this once or twice.

31:44.251 --> 31:45.718
Why doesn't that surprise me?

31:46.687 --> 31:49.815
The best lie, the one that's easiest
to remember with consistency...

31:49.991 --> 31:51.925
...is the one that's based on the truth.

31:52.093 --> 31:54.584
When I would do this,
I'd base it on my name, Bishop.

31:54.762 --> 31:56.423
So, Peter King, Peter Knight.

31:56.597 --> 32:00.431
Well, that's a great idea
if your last name is as simple as Bishop...

32:00.601 --> 32:03.069
...but what do you do when it's Ostler?

32:03.237 --> 32:05.501
Is there a computer around here
I could use?

32:10.745 --> 32:14.738
This is a serial abductor, so she's smart.
She's probably switched cars since then.

32:14.915 --> 32:19.784
I want a record of every stolen car
from the last 36 hours.

32:42.343 --> 32:45.335
Hey, where does this print? Thanks.

32:45.513 --> 32:47.777
Every gas station
from Middletown to Rochester...

32:47.948 --> 32:49.916
...and pull all the credit card receipts.

32:51.218 --> 32:54.244
Middle English for innkeeper.

32:54.422 --> 32:56.549
Hold on. Middle English?

32:56.724 --> 32:58.589
The point is, innkeeper got me to hotel.

32:58.759 --> 33:02.126
I cross-indexed last names
that match hotels with her first name.

33:02.296 --> 33:05.629
- Joanne Ritz.
- No photo, just a PO Box in Clarksburg.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.791
- PO Box.
- Criminals don't like people...

33:07.968 --> 33:09.560
...knowing where they live.

33:11.005 --> 33:14.338
Can you expand the grid search
for Ben Stockton to Clarksburg?

33:32.693 --> 33:34.456
What is it, Ben? What's wrong?

33:34.962 --> 33:38.022
I just... I don't see it.

33:38.199 --> 33:43.159
It's okay, Bean.
You're doing great, honey.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.389
I can't.

34:09.362 --> 34:11.263
I don't know how it ends.

34:18.205 --> 34:19.934
Mom?

34:20.741 --> 34:24.507
No. Please, I don't wanna go away.

34:24.678 --> 34:26.578
Well, that's up to Ben, isn't it?

34:27.748 --> 34:29.375
Mom.

34:29.917 --> 34:32.681
Stop! What are you doing to her?

34:32.853 --> 34:36.254
If you lose her again,
you'll only have yourself to blame.

34:37.358 --> 34:39.087
Mom!

35:01.949 --> 35:04.816
I'm sorry I upset you last night.

35:04.985 --> 35:07.112
Go away.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.772
There's a little boy out there.

35:29.610 --> 35:33.740
He's in trouble. We're his only hope.

35:34.615 --> 35:37.641
I don't want to talk about math, Walter.

35:37.818 --> 35:40.844
We don't need to talk about the equation.

35:41.822 --> 35:46.088
I need to know about the woman,
where she took you.

35:46.260 --> 35:49.320
You're wrong. There was no woman.

35:50.798 --> 35:52.493
Dashiell...

35:52.867 --> 35:56.268
...if you don't, the boy...

35:57.805 --> 35:59.739
He'll end up like us.

36:00.341 --> 36:04.004
Walter, please. I can't!

36:04.445 --> 36:07.505
Yes, you can.

36:13.487 --> 36:16.479
It was so beautiful.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.321
She promised me things...

36:20.494 --> 36:22.291
...what I wanted most of all...

36:27.668 --> 36:30.762
...but when I couldn't solve
the equation...

36:30.938 --> 36:32.269
...she took it away.

36:34.909 --> 36:37.537
Everything she promised...

36:38.646 --> 36:39.874
...it was all a lie.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.449
None of it was real.

36:44.585 --> 36:46.815
She hurt me.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.682
She put me in a dungeon.

36:53.494 --> 36:57.453
She filled my mind with images
of people I loved...

36:58.198 --> 36:59.631
...and then tortured them...

37:01.035 --> 37:03.469
...ripping them apart...

37:04.204 --> 37:09.836
...all the while, trying to suck
the answer she wanted out of my head.

37:11.578 --> 37:13.136
But I couldn't.

37:13.314 --> 37:17.216
I couldn't give her what she wanted.

37:18.018 --> 37:21.886
- Where were you, Dashiell?
- I told you, a dungeon.

37:22.056 --> 37:24.388
No, no, no.

37:24.558 --> 37:27.857
Not some fantasy, you nitwit.

37:29.330 --> 37:33.664
- Where were you really?
- Dungeon. A dungeon in a red castle.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.302
You listen. You answer me.

37:37.037 --> 37:40.473
No, no. Don't you understand?

37:40.641 --> 37:42.074
No, listen.

37:42.242 --> 37:44.767
This is the only way we'll find him.

37:48.482 --> 37:50.382
None of it happened.

37:50.551 --> 37:53.315
It was just a dream.

37:53.754 --> 37:56.348
Just a bad dream.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.695
You're making a terrible mistake.

38:08.869 --> 38:11.133
Despite whatever strings
you've managed to pull...

38:11.305 --> 38:14.502
...your father is not mentally fit
to be released from this hospital.

38:14.675 --> 38:15.937
Thanks for the advice.

38:16.110 --> 38:19.443
My personal assessment is that
he's safer with me than he is with you.

38:19.613 --> 38:21.376
He may not be the picture of sanity...

38:21.548 --> 38:24.745
...but when I saw him come through
that door, I saw him change.

38:24.918 --> 38:28.046
- He was afraid.
- So, what are you saying?

38:28.522 --> 38:32.618
Are you saying that I somehow managed
to intentionally harm him?

38:35.195 --> 38:38.289
"Office of Homeland Security."

38:38.465 --> 38:40.626
- How'd you pull this off?
- Meaning?

38:40.801 --> 38:44.259
Meaning that since you were here last,
I learned a little bit about you.

38:44.438 --> 38:47.771
Enrolling in MIT
based on fraudulent credentials...

38:47.941 --> 38:50.774
...starting businesses and failing,
and then running away...

38:50.944 --> 38:52.002
Do you have a point?

38:52.179 --> 38:55.512
You are not a fit guardian for Walter...

38:55.682 --> 38:59.812
...and I'm gonna petition the state
to have him removed from your custody.

38:59.987 --> 39:01.249
Excuse me?

39:01.422 --> 39:04.687
Whether you're willing to recognize it
or not, Walter is a danger...

39:04.858 --> 39:07.190
...both to himself and to others.

39:07.728 --> 39:10.629
Then I guess the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

39:10.798 --> 39:12.698
You think you know
what he's capable of...

39:12.866 --> 39:15.061
...but you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

39:17.204 --> 39:19.365
Are you threatening me?

39:21.208 --> 39:25.235
- I'd like to see my father now.
- Uh-huh.

39:35.055 --> 39:36.818
Walter?

39:39.159 --> 39:41.059
Are you okay?

39:44.998 --> 39:47.398
I'd like to go now.

39:47.901 --> 39:50.870
Of course. We'll go right now.

39:52.539 --> 39:54.564
I failed.

39:55.609 --> 39:57.736
It was all for nothing.

39:59.046 --> 40:05.349
Dashiell went on and on
like an incoherent loon...

40:05.853 --> 40:11.723
...about being taken to dungeons
in red castles.

40:14.428 --> 40:15.895
Son...

40:17.197 --> 40:20.963
...is that what it's like to talk to me?

40:21.602 --> 40:23.229
Walter...

40:26.640 --> 40:27.902
Let's go home.

40:31.912 --> 40:34.779
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm Special Agent Francis, with the FBI.

40:34.948 --> 40:38.145
I was wondering if you've seen this boy.
His name's Ben Stockton. He's 10 years old.

40:39.586 --> 40:41.816
No, I'm sorry. What happened to him?

40:42.022 --> 40:44.889
- This is Dunham.
- Hey, it's me.

40:45.058 --> 40:47.322
Just want you to know he's out.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.689
Good. How's he doing?

40:49.863 --> 40:52.297
Yeah, he's okay,
but I hope you got a lead there.

40:52.466 --> 40:53.956
Because this was a total bust.

40:54.134 --> 40:57.069
I'm sorry. So he wasn't able
to connect with Dashiell?

40:57.237 --> 40:59.899
No. He's taking it pretty hard.
He's beating himself up.

41:00.073 --> 41:01.540
Did he get anything?

41:01.708 --> 41:05.872
He just said the guy was babbling on,
talking about red castles and dungeons.

41:06.046 --> 41:07.809
You know, he did what he could.

41:07.981 --> 41:10.677
- I'm just glad he's okay.
- Yeah, me too.

41:10.851 --> 41:12.910
If any red castles appear,
I'll let you know.

41:13.086 --> 41:14.644
Sure.

41:40.214 --> 41:42.944
It's not a drawbridge, but it's close.

41:43.116 --> 41:46.608
This place looks like
it hasn't been used for a while.

41:47.087 --> 41:48.679
It's Francis.

41:48.855 --> 41:52.951
Need you to pull up a property search
on an address for me.

41:53.927 --> 41:55.258
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

41:55.429 --> 41:57.522
I think I found something.

42:32.032 --> 42:33.932
Watch yourself.

43:26.320 --> 43:28.447
Thank God.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.256
You're gonna be okay.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.590
Stop!

44:06.760 --> 44:08.819
Put your hands in the air!

44:17.504 --> 44:18.835
You okay?

44:19.005 --> 44:20.336
She was just there.

44:34.321 --> 44:36.380
Nice to be home, right?

44:39.092 --> 44:41.356
This place is filthy.

44:41.528 --> 44:43.621
Did you have a party while I was gone?

44:43.797 --> 44:46.391
No, Walter, I did not have a party.

44:47.801 --> 44:50.292
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way...

44:50.470 --> 44:53.906
...but I need space.
- Oh?

44:54.107 --> 44:56.974
Sorry to spring this on you so suddenly...

44:57.144 --> 45:01.308
...but these quarters are very cramped.

45:01.481 --> 45:04.678
I think I'm ready for my own room.

45:05.352 --> 45:07.980
Well, that's not a problem.

45:08.155 --> 45:11.420
I can talk to Olivia tomorrow
about getting you some on-campus housing.

45:11.591 --> 45:14.651
That would be very beneficial.

45:16.563 --> 45:18.622
What you did
by going back into that place...

45:18.799 --> 45:20.790
...was very, very brave, Walter.

45:27.941 --> 45:29.067
Thank you, son.

45:46.593 --> 45:50.689
Got it. Now let's see
if it really does what you said it would.

46:13.887 --> 46:15.115
Where's the equation?

46:23.263 --> 46:27.962
Seems crazy that some numbers
can make a machine like this work.

46:28.134 --> 46:31.365
Look around your house,
your office, your kitchen...

46:32.172 --> 46:34.037
Numbers make everything work.

46:37.143 --> 46:38.872
Here we go.

47:16.216 --> 47:19.515
It worked. That's incredible.

47:35.101 --> 47:36.830
It worked.

47:37.170 --> 47:39.195
Ben, are you hungry?

47:39.372 --> 47:42.671
There's a vending machine in the hall.
I've got a roll of quarters.

47:42.842 --> 47:44.935
- No, I'm okay, thanks.
- Sure?

47:45.111 --> 47:46.703
Mm-hm.

47:47.147 --> 47:48.842
- Ben?
- Dad?

47:49.015 --> 47:50.846
- Ben!
- Dad!

47:56.723 --> 47:58.350
Release forms.

47:58.525 --> 48:01.016
Soon as he signs, they're free to go.

48:01.194 --> 48:05.893
Yeah... Oh, we should maybe
just let them have a minute.

48:07.434 --> 48:09.299
I really need to call Peter and Walter.

48:09.469 --> 48:12.905
After what Walter went through,
he'll be happy to know Ben's all right.

48:14.040 --> 48:15.735
Good work.
