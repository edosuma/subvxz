03:01.000 --> 03:03.787
They stand there, barking.
26 dogs.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.749
I see their mean faces.
They've come to kill.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.828
And they tell my boss Bertold:

03:11.240 --> 03:16.030
"Give us Boaz Rein, or we'll eat
your customers. In 1 minute!"

03:16.440 --> 03:18.305
26 dogs?
- Exactly.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.007
How do you know there
are 26 and not 30?

03:23.160 --> 03:24.673
I'm coming to that.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.347
Well?
- Well what?

03:31.760 --> 03:36.072
Do you check it out?
- What do you think happens?

03:37.480 --> 03:40.631
I wake up!
- At that point every time?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.025
Exactly.
It always stops there.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.823
Since when?
- Two and a half years.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.743
And you call me now, at this hour?
- Asshole!

03:49.160 --> 03:51.628
Don't call me an asshole.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.784
This dream is coming from somewhere.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.671
I haven't told you everything.
- Like what?

04:01.080 --> 04:02.388
You know, in Lebanon...

04:02.800 --> 04:04.153
What about Lebanon?

04:04.560 --> 04:07.666
At the start of the war,
we went into Lebanese villages

04:08.080 --> 04:11.390
to search for wanted Palestinians.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.583
Yeah, and?

04:28.640 --> 04:34.226
When someone enters a village,
the dogs smell and bark to alert.

04:34.920 --> 04:40.108
Everyone wakes up,
and the fugitives take off.

04:40.920 --> 04:45.391
Someone had to liquidate them.
Otherwise our men would have died.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.586
But why you?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.584
They knew I couldn't shoot a person.
They told me:

04:52.000 --> 04:55.265
"Go ahead and shoot the dogs!"

05:11.480 --> 05:14.950
26 dogs,
I remember every single one.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.866
Every face, every wound,
the look in their eyes... 26 dogs.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.113
How long before they started
appearing in your dreams?

05:24.520 --> 05:25.589
20 years.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.072
Have you tried anything?
- Like what?

05:29.480 --> 05:33.109
Therapy, a psychiatrist,
Shiatsu, anything...

05:33.520 --> 05:35.863
No, nothing. I called you.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.747
I'm just a filmmaker!

05:38.160 --> 05:40.071
Can't films be therapeutic?

05:40.600 --> 05:43.672
You've dealt with all the issues
in your films, right?

05:44.200 --> 05:46.430
But nothing like this.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.546
No flashbacks from Lebanon?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.946
No. Not really.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.349
Are you sure?

05:56.640 --> 05:57.789
No.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.747
Beirut, Sabra and Shatila?
- What about that?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.947
You were only 100 yards away
from the massacre!

06:03.360 --> 06:06.784
More like 200 or 300 yards.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.545
The truth is
that's not stored in my system.

06:10.960 --> 06:14.145
No flashbacks or dreams?
You never think about it?

06:14.560 --> 06:16.232
No, no.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.264
No.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.466
You'll be okay, huh?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.145
You think so?
- Sure.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.666
You're sure?
- Yes. I'll think of something.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.470
Sure?
- Sure.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.071
The meeting with Boaz
took place in winter, 2006.

07:14.480 --> 07:18.712
That night,
for the first time in 20 years,

07:19.120 --> 07:21.384
I had a flashback
of the war in Lebanon.

07:21.800 --> 07:26.191
Not just Lebanon, West Beirut.
Not just Beirut,

07:26.600 --> 07:30.866
but the massacre
at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.873
What's wrong?
It's 6:30 in the morning!

08:57.800 --> 09:02.908
We all have friends
who are lawyers, doctors, therapists...

09:03.320 --> 09:06.585
Sometimes that friendship costs them.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.663
But you wouldn't
wake your lawyer friend at 6:30!

09:11.080 --> 09:13.787
My lawyer is 10 times cheaper than you!

09:14.480 --> 09:16.232
I just don't understand.

09:16.640 --> 09:22.624
Why Boaz's dream with the dogs?

09:24.320 --> 09:28.586
Why that to jog my memory?
It has nothing to do with me.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.710
Memory is fascinating.
Take this psychological experiment...

09:37.360 --> 09:42.866
A group of people were shown
10 various childhood images.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.991
Nine were really from their childhood
and one was fake:

09:47.400 --> 09:53.987
Their portrait was pasted
into a fairground they never visited.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.112
Eighty percent recognized themselves...

10:01.520 --> 10:04.546
They recognized the fake photo as real!

10:04.960 --> 10:07.667
Twenty percent couldn't remember.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.310
The researchers asked them again.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.109
The second time, the others said
that they remembered the image.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.030
"Such a wonderful day at the park
with my parents."

10:19.440 --> 10:22.625
They remembered
a completely fabricated experience.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.548
Memory is dynamic. It's alive.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.867
If some details are missing,

10:30.280 --> 10:34.990
memory fills the holes
with things that never happened.

10:37.400 --> 10:43.384
So my vision of the massacre
is like the fake photo?

10:44.120 --> 10:48.272
It never happened?
I invented it? It's not real?

10:48.680 --> 10:51.274
I don't know.
Who was there with you?

10:51.680 --> 10:55.264
Carmi was there.
You know him from school.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.194
And someone else I don't recognize.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.594
So go ask Carmi what he remembers.
- He's in Holland.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.184
He's lived there for 20 years.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.024
Go to Holland and ask him
if it bothers you.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.429
Isn't that dangerous?

11:12.840 --> 11:16.628
Maybe I'll discover things
I don't want to know about myself?

11:17.040 --> 11:18.314
Not at all.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.747
You'll discover important things
that you want to know.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.789
We don't go places
where we really don't want to.

11:27.200 --> 11:31.387
A human mechanism
prevents us from entering dark places.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.588
Memory takes us
where we need to go.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.463
See all that?

12:14.040 --> 12:15.473
Yes.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.387
It's all mine.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.629
All of it?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.994
From those trees to the river.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.630
It all belongs to you?
- Yes, and the house.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.591
It's about 10 acres.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.224
All that just from selling falafel?
- Just from falafel!

12:36.640 --> 12:39.234
Wow!
- Come and see.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.432
How much falafel did you sell?
- Three years was enough.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.392
In the early '90s
I had a small stand in Utrecht.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.674
Health food was in fashion.
The Middle East too...

12:55.880 --> 12:58.622
Falafel is both healthy
and Middle Eastern.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.708
Everyone thought you'd become
a nuclear physicist.

13:04.635 --> 13:05.670
Who did?

13:06.080 --> 13:09.709
I don't know, your family,
my family, our school friends.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.626
They thought that by the age of 40
you'd be nominated for a Nobel Prize.

13:15.635 --> 13:17.125
By 20, that future was over.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.183
Cold?

13:20.240 --> 13:24.119
Cold? I'm freezing!
- Let's go inside.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.993
We have to walk all that way?

13:28.960 --> 13:31.588
It's funny you've showed up now.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.621
Why?
- When you called...

13:34.720 --> 13:38.986
I had just gone out with my son Thomas.
He's seven.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.949
He was playing with a toy gun
and started asking questions.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.227
"What did you do in the army?
Ever shoot anyone?"

13:47.135 --> 13:48.625
Did you?
- I don't know.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.466
Let's go inside and warm up.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.625
Would you mind if I sketch
you and your son playing in the snow?

13:57.440 --> 13:58.953
No.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.621
Not at all. Draw as much as you like.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.832
I'll fetch him.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.907
It's fine as long as you draw,
but don't film.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.944
As strange as it sounds,
we were transported to war

15:20.360 --> 15:25.593
on a little "Love Boat"
leased by the army or God knows what.

15:26.200 --> 15:30.387
They wanted to mislead the enemy
and launch a surprise attack.

15:31.400 --> 15:36.269
What do you mean a "Love Boat"?
With jacuzzis and bars?

15:36.680 --> 15:42.107
All of that?
- That's how I imagined it.

15:42.700 --> 15:48.684
I later found out it was
just an old commando boat.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.431
For 18 you seemed pretty bright to me.
I never took you for a fighter.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.350
Frankly, it was important to me
for a pretty practical reason.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.543
I felt like everyone else
was screwing like rabbits.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.503
and that I was the only...
How can I put it?

16:04.960 --> 16:08.430
The only nerd good at chess and Math

16:09.160 --> 16:13.711
but with masculinity problems.
So, I had to prove to everyone

16:14.120 --> 16:16.543
that I was the best fighter
and some big hero.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.905
Did you succeed?

16:19.960 --> 16:21.825
Yes, surprisingly enough.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.023
I felt that I was strong and capable.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.787
Then the war started and
they put us on that damned "Love Boat"

16:33.040 --> 16:35.986
Then I...
- You what?

16:36.400 --> 16:41.110
I puked like a pig!
I wondered what the enemy would think.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.353
I finally collapsed on deck
and fell asleep.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.703
I sleep when I'm scared.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.986
To this day,
I escape into sleep and hallucinate.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.986
Unconscious on the deck,

17:38.120 --> 17:43.433
dreaming a woman would come

17:47.960 --> 17:50.872
and take me for the first time,

17:53.720 --> 17:58.271
I saw my best friends
go up in flames before my eyes.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.433
Where?
- On the boat.

18:33.200 --> 18:37.193
I woke up just before we docked.
It's dawn, and we're in a city.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.063
Which city?
- How should I know?

18:40.640 --> 18:42.551
Sidon, I think.

18:43.160 --> 18:47.585
Out of pure fear and anxiety
we start shooting like lunatics.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.511
At whom?
- How do I know?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.264
Then an old Mercedes drives up.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.103
Everyone fires at it like crazy.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.503
Two years of training,
and the fear,

19:06.920 --> 19:09.150
the uncontrollable fear...

19:12.440 --> 19:16.627
Then the silence.
The terrible silence of death.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.943
At daybreak

19:21.440 --> 19:26.025
we could see our destruction,

19:28.840 --> 19:31.104
without knowing where we were.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.670
Lying in the car...

19:35.320 --> 19:37.072
What was in the car?

19:37.440 --> 19:38.828
The bodies of a whole family.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.027
Why did you come here?

19:42.520 --> 19:44.272
Me? I...

19:45.640 --> 19:46.993
I lost my memory.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.744
In an accident?
- What?

19:50.160 --> 19:52.708
Did you have an accident?
- What do you mean?

19:53.560 --> 19:56.154
In a car or at work?

19:56.600 --> 19:59.023
No, I didn't have an accident.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.353
I just can't remember anything
about the Lebanon War.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.594
Just one image in my mind.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.192
Somehow you're in it.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.953
What image?

20:49.920 --> 20:51.911
Were you there too?

20:54.920 --> 20:55.432
It's hard to say.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.512
What do you mean?
Were you there?

20:57.920 --> 20:59.228
It's hard to say.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.989
I don't remember anything
about the massacre.

21:03.640 --> 21:07.303
But you were in Beirut
when the massacre took place.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.153
Yes, I remember being there.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.307
I'll never forget
us marching into Beirut.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.348
But the massacre...
How did you say it?

21:15.760 --> 21:18.433
That's not stored in my system.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.584
Right.
Massacre...

21:56.520 --> 22:00.786
<i>Then it happened in a taxi</i>
<i>to Amsterdam airport...</i>

22:01.200 --> 22:03.794
<i>Suddenly all the memories came back.</i>

22:04.200 --> 22:06.145
<i>Not a hallucination</i>
<i>nor my subconscious.</i>

22:06.800 --> 22:11.351
<i>The first day of the war. Barely 19,</i>
<i>I haven't even started shaving.</i>

22:11.760 --> 22:14.786
<i>We're driving down a road.</i>
<i>Orchards on one side,</i>

22:15.200 --> 22:19.944
<i>the sea on the other.</i>
<i>We're shooting everywhere</i>

22:20.360 --> 22:22.464
<i>at everything, until nightfall.</i>

22:27.160 --> 22:30.072
<i>That evening, when we stopped,</i>
<i>an officer tells me:</i>

22:30.480 --> 22:33.426
<i>"Load up the dead and wounded.</i>

22:33.840 --> 22:36.183
<i>Go and dump them."</i>

22:36.600 --> 22:39.706
<i>"Dump?"</i>
- <i>"Yes, dump."</i>

22:40.120 --> 22:41.348
<i>"Where?"</i>

22:41.760 --> 22:47.426
<i>"How should I know?</i>
<i>Out there, near that bright light.</i>

22:47.840 --> 22:50.104
<i>That's where they're dumped."</i>

22:56.520 --> 23:00.388
<i>So I drive all the way back.</i>

23:00.800 --> 23:05.146
<i>I had never seen an open wound</i>
<i>or any kind of bleeding before.</i>

23:05.560 --> 23:07.266
<i>Now I was in command of a tank</i>

23:07.680 --> 23:12.629
<i>full of the dead and wounded,</i>
<i>looking for a bright light, salvation.</i>

23:19.840 --> 23:22.912
What should we do?
Why don't you tell us what to do?

23:23.320 --> 23:25.151
Shoot.
- At who?

23:25.560 --> 23:27.152
How do I know? Just shoot.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.064
Isn't it better to pray?
- Then pray and shoot.

23:42.360 --> 23:46.069
<i>Finally we see the helicopter lights.</i>
<i>Like halos.</i>

23:46.480 --> 23:51.349
<i>As we get closer to the light,</i>
<i>we see dead and wounded everywhere.</i>

24:24.960 --> 24:29.750
<i>We unload mechanically,</i>
<i>as if</i> we're <i>not even present.</i>

24:30.160 --> 24:32.833
<i>Then we turn around and drive off.</i>

24:58.220 --> 25:00.711
On the first day of the war,

25:01.220 --> 25:04.064
I transported the dead and wounded

25:04.480 --> 25:07.392
from tanks on the coast road.

25:08.220 --> 25:10.211
I'm looking for people who were with me.

25:10.280 --> 25:13.704
Could your men have been among them?

25:13.760 --> 25:18.709
It sounds logical...
We were in the coastal area.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.711
In the western sector...
It's possible.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.704
Do you recognize me here?

25:29.220 --> 25:30.312
No.

25:32.220 --> 25:34.211
I don't recognize myself either.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.673
Crossing the border at Rosh Hanikra,
felt like an excursion.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.354
We took photos,

25:54.760 --> 25:56.705
we told jokes...

25:57.120 --> 26:01.193
We had time to fool around
before going into action.

26:02.520 --> 26:08.743
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

26:16.200 --> 26:22.184
<i>Too much pain to carry on</i>

26:23.200 --> 26:28.388
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

26:29.360 --> 26:34.343
The landscape was beautiful,
trees all around,

26:34.760 --> 26:39.948
a few scattered houses...
A really idyllic pastoral scene.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.511
The slow drive allowed us
to enjoy the scenery.

26:43.920 --> 26:50.393
<i>May your dreams come true</i>

26:51.120 --> 26:57.070
<i>May your nightmares pass</i>

26:58.080 --> 27:03.063
<i>Your existence is</i> a <i>blessing, Lebanon</i>

27:03.440 --> 27:06.830
In a tank, you always feel really safe.

27:07.240 --> 27:11.586
A tank is a very massive
enclosed vehicle.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.911
Inside the tank,

27:14.320 --> 27:15.628
we were protected.

27:19.180 --> 27:25.346
<i>You are torn to pieces</i>

27:25.760 --> 27:32.347
<i>You bleed to death in my arms</i>

27:32.840 --> 27:35.252
<i>You bleed to death in my arms</i>

27:36.160 --> 27:39.550
<i>You are the love of my life</i>

27:40.640 --> 27:46.272
<i>Oh, my short, short life</i>

27:46.680 --> 27:51.708
<i>Tear me to pieces</i>

27:53.720 --> 27:56.109
<i>I'm bleeding....</i>

28:00.600 --> 28:04.866
Suddenly our commander
stopped responding. We lost contact.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.872
Was he beside you?
- Yes.

28:07.280 --> 28:11.671
I saw his head slumped forward.

28:12.720 --> 28:16.429
I went down inside and saw blood,
blood in the tank.

28:17.480 --> 28:22.907
The blood was coming from his neck.

28:25.480 --> 28:29.393
You were next in command?
- Yes, I was.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.473
But I didn't react immediately.

28:33.080 --> 28:37.267
We just stayed in the tank
without even thinking of firing back.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.069
Two minutes later,

28:42.480 --> 28:46.428
there was an explosion. Everyone tried
to escape from the tank hysterically...

28:50.600 --> 28:53.831
without weapons or anything...

28:54.240 --> 28:57.027
Those who stayed inside,
were killed in the tank.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.468
I ran as fast as I could

29:05.880 --> 29:08.428
in zigzags towards the sea.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.987
My only thought:

29:29.400 --> 29:32.631
It's over. I'm done for.

29:33.640 --> 29:37.986
They'll be here any minute.
All I can do is wait for the end.

29:44.360 --> 29:48.103
I saw the building from which they
were shooting, and the commander.

29:48.520 --> 29:53.469
I hoped he'd get closer.

30:19.680 --> 30:23.548
I don't know why,
but he started to retreat.

30:34.600 --> 30:39.185
I felt abandoned by our forces.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.873
I imagined how my mother would react.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.751
We're very close.
I was always like her right hand.

30:53.160 --> 30:57.665
I'm the only one
who helps out at home.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.232
Like the firstborn son.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.863
I took a peek.
I saw them chatting, smoking.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.991
I wondered why

31:10.400 --> 31:12.391
they didn't notice me.

31:13.960 --> 31:18.033
I peeked a few more times,
I realized that they probably thought

31:18.440 --> 31:22.706
that everyone was killed in the attack.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.146
I decided to wait until dark.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.824
I had a good place to hide.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.983
I don't know why, but I decided

31:40.400 --> 31:42.709
to crawl out to the sea.

31:47.800 --> 31:53.272
I didn't want to stay close to shore,
so I swam quite far out.

31:54.840 --> 31:59.186
When I felt I was far out enough
I started swimming south.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.589
How was the sea?

32:01.000 --> 32:04.788
Really calm, no waves.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.553
I felt calm and at peace.
Just me and the sea.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.792
I felt safe, because the sea
was calm and peaceful.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.312
But I was still really afraid

32:31.400 --> 32:34.346
that my strength would fail
and I'd drown.

32:34.760 --> 32:39.424
Or maybe someone might spot me
and shoot at me, kill me.

32:49.960 --> 32:54.545
While swimming through
this peaceful water,

32:54.960 --> 32:57.952
I suddenly heard a loud noise.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.066
I felt the water pulsating.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.632
I felt the turbulent water
enveloping me.

33:05.480 --> 33:09.473
My body shook with fear.

33:37.640 --> 33:41.872
I saw lights in the distance
and I headed in that direction.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.874
They might be Israeli forces.

33:45.280 --> 33:49.068
I kept swimming
but felt my strength was dwindling.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.903
I could barely move my limbs.

34:02.920 --> 34:06.549
Sometimes I simply
let the water carry me along.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.194
I eventually reached shore
and started walking.

34:18.600 --> 34:23.469
I heard voices speaking Hebrew
on the two-way radio.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.110
I knew

34:27.040 --> 34:30.987
that I had to get to them
despite my exhaustion.

34:38.400 --> 34:42.473
To my amazement, it was
the regiment that had abandoned me.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.822
After I got back to my regiment,

34:50.239 --> 34:52.424
I felt like...

34:54.159 --> 34:57.152
like it was me who had
abandoned my comrades.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.630
I always felt
that they regarded me like...

35:04.600 --> 35:08.673
like someone who didn't help
rescue his friends.

35:08.680 --> 35:15.392
As if I had fled the battlefield
just to save my own skin.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.671
I sometimes felt very uneasy.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.150
I broke off contact
with the families of the dead.

35:20.560 --> 35:26.988
At first I visited their graves,
but then I just stopped.

35:27.400 --> 35:32.110
I wanted to forget.
I didn't want to relive those moments.

35:32.520 --> 35:36.672
Visiting the graves, you felt...
- Guilty.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.186
I felt guilty standing at their graves.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.194
As if I didn't do enough.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.954
I didn't do enough.

35:45.360 --> 35:51.151
I wasn't the hero type who carries
weapons and saves everyone's life.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.427
That's not me. I'm not the type.

36:30.960 --> 36:34.145
<i>I bombed Sidon today</i>

36:35.560 --> 36:40.145
<i>amid the clouds of smoke at dawn</i>

36:40.720 --> 36:45.032
<i>I almost went home in a coffin</i>

36:46.560 --> 36:49.063
<i>I bombed Sidon today</i>

36:53.460 --> 36:56.714
<i>One month after Ronnie Dayag</i>
<i>swam back home safely.</i>

36:57.120 --> 37:00.544
<i>the army took the beach</i>
<i>from which he had fled.</i>

37:00.960 --> 37:04.623
<i>They told us we'd soon attack Beirut</i>
<i>and that we'd all die.</i>

37:05.240 --> 37:09.472
<i>But on the beach,</i>
<i>we didn't think much about death.</i>

37:09.880 --> 37:11.984
<i>I had a hut of banana leaves.</i>

37:12.400 --> 37:14.152
<i>Thinking back,</i>

37:14.560 --> 37:19.873
<i>the smell of Patchouli Oil</i>
<i>still makes me nauseous.</i>

37:21.480 --> 37:25.792
<i>It was really popular in the '80s.</i>
<i>For my roommate Frenkel,</i>

37:26.200 --> 37:31.513
<i>Patchouli was not just a fragrance,</i>
<i>it was</i> a <i>way of life.</i>

37:59.080 --> 38:01.787
Patchouli...
How do you use it?

38:02.320 --> 38:03.753
Show me.

38:05.120 --> 38:08.908
You sprinkle a drop on your hand,
like this.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.543
This way,

38:18.960 --> 38:21.713
your comrades always know you're there.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.704
I remember my men telling me:

38:26.120 --> 38:30.989
"Frenkel, you walk too fast.
Like a rabbit."

38:33.480 --> 38:36.665
So what do you do? Patchouli!

38:37.080 --> 38:40.470
In the dark, at night...
They couldn't miss me!

38:40.880 --> 38:44.953
The scent is really strong,
even out in the field.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.153
I still use it.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.784
<i>I bombed Beirut today</i>

38:54.320 --> 38:58.154
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

38:59.240 --> 39:04.030
<i>If I came close to death</i>
<i>I couldn't say</i>

39:04.640 --> 39:07.507
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

39:09.200 --> 39:12.909
<i>At the pull of a trigger</i>

39:14.520 --> 39:17.751
<i>We can send strangers</i>
<i>straight to Hell</i>

39:20.080 --> 39:23.914
<i>Sure, we kill some innocent</i>
<i>along the way</i>

39:24.840 --> 39:29.550
<i>If I came close to death</i>
<i>I couldn't say</i>

39:29.960 --> 39:31.143
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

39:33.880 --> 39:35.905
<i>Our daily routine was this:</i>

39:37.440 --> 39:38.953
Get up in the morning,

39:40.160 --> 39:44.392
prepare breakfast
on those frying pans,

39:44.940 --> 39:46.988
potted beef and eggs.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.170
On the beach.
- On the beach.

39:50.180 --> 39:50.669
Take a quick swim,

39:51.680 --> 39:54.672
back into uniform,
then go after some terrorists.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.025
Someone yelled, "Frenkel!"

41:23.000 --> 41:25.184
I noticed a boy holding an RPG.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.067
A kid.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.151
Frenkel, was I there too?

41:42.600 --> 41:46.991
Sure. From training camp,
you were with me wherever I went.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.871
Even there?
- Yes, there too.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.489
Good to know. Of course I was there.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.152
Is it possible that I can't remember
such a dramatic event?

41:59.560 --> 42:01.187
We call them "dissociative events".

42:01.720 --> 42:05.907
It's when a person is in a situation
but feels outside it.

42:06.320 --> 42:10.029
I was once visited by a young man,
an amateur photographer.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.750
I asked him in 1983, "How did you
survive through that grueling war?"

42:14.560 --> 42:18.064
He replied, "It was quite easy.
I regarded it as a long day-trip."

42:18.960 --> 42:22.305
He told himself.
"W ow! What great scenes:

42:22.720 --> 42:25.587
shooting, artillery,
wounded people, screaming..."

42:26.000 --> 42:30.824
He looked at everything
as if through an imaginary camera.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.912
Then something happened:

42:47.000 --> 42:48.991
his 'camera' broke.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.954
He said that the situation
turned traumatic for him

43:04.360 --> 43:08.785
when they arrived in the vicinity of the
stables in Beirut.

43:09.200 --> 43:10.224
The Hippodrome.

43:10.640 --> 43:14.303
He saw a huge number of carcasses

43:14.720 --> 43:18.554
of slaughtered Arabian horses.

43:18.960 --> 43:23.750
"It broke my heart.", he said.
"What had those horses done

43:24.160 --> 43:26.310
to deserve such suffering?"

43:26.720 --> 43:29.905
He couldn't handle seeing
those dead and wounded horses.

43:30.320 --> 43:33.027
He had used a mechanism
to remain outside events,

43:33.440 --> 43:36.750
as if watching the war on film
instead of participating.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.151
This protected him.

43:39.560 --> 43:43.712
Once pulled into the events,
he could no longer deny reality.

43:44.600 --> 43:48.184
Horror surrounded him
and he freaked out.

43:55.160 --> 43:59.108
You told me earlier that
you can't remember being in the orchard

43:59.520 --> 44:00.703
where the boy with the RPG was.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.503
Can you remember other things?
Like going home,

44:06.120 --> 44:08.668
chatting with friends,
events from that time,

44:09.080 --> 44:12.948
something that maybe reminds you
of that time?

44:13.360 --> 44:16.193
Yes, in detail.
- For example?

44:16.600 --> 44:19.273
I can remember perfectly
every furlough.

45:07.520 --> 45:10.865
<i>I remember when I was about 10,</i>
<i>there was</i> a <i>war going on.</i>

45:11.920 --> 45:14.411
<i>And everything came to a halt.</i>
<i>All the fathers were at the front.</i>

45:15.240 --> 45:18.732
<i>All children sat with their mothers</i>
<i>closed up indoors,</i>

45:19.740 --> 45:22.231
<i>behind closed blinds in the dark.</i>

45:22.740 --> 45:25.846
<i>Just waiting for a plane to drop a bomb</i>
<i>and kill them all.</i>

45:28.360 --> 45:28.849
<i>No one even dreamed of going outside.</i>

45:31.920 --> 45:36.345
<i>When I went home from Lebanon</i>
<i>for the first time in six weeks,</i>

45:36.800 --> 45:40.304
<i>and saw that life</i>
<i>was carrying on normally.</i>

45:51.680 --> 45:56.390
<i>My goal on leave</i>
<i>was to get back my girlfriend Yaeli.</i>

45:56.800 --> 45:59.633
<i>She had dumped me the night before</i>
<i>all of this started.</i>

46:19.440 --> 46:23.672
Remember, how?
Add some Sprite...

46:24.080 --> 46:25.468
Ready?

46:30.520 --> 46:31.589
Bottoms up!

46:35.400 --> 46:37.186
The memories are coming back.

46:37.600 --> 46:42.424
I met people who served with me.
I almost have the full picture.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.752
At which point?
- The first day of the war,

46:46.160 --> 46:48.310
the siege on Beirut.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.790
You remember
that Yaeli dumped you a week before?

46:51.720 --> 46:52.823
How do you know?

46:56.520 --> 46:59.751
Didn't you know
that I was in love with her for years?

47:01.720 --> 47:04.314
No, I didn't know that.

47:04.720 --> 47:05.948
It's true.

47:08.160 --> 47:10.663
What's wrong?
That was 20 years ago.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.503
It's OK. I'm not angry.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.748
At least you had your home,
your family.

47:19.160 --> 47:22.027
What home? What family?

47:23.040 --> 47:24.029
You have no idea.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.589
My father...

47:26.360 --> 47:31.627
To comfort me,
he told me that in his war,

47:32.040 --> 47:33.871
World War II...

47:34.280 --> 47:35.713
Russian soldiers in Stalingrad

47:36.120 --> 47:39.226
were given 48 hours leave
only after one year on the front.

47:48.320 --> 47:52.950
They got on a train,
arrived home at the station,

47:53.840 --> 47:55.910
kissed their girlfriends
on the platform,

47:56.280 --> 48:00.592
then had to get back on board
to head back to the front.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.228
Understand?

48:05.240 --> 48:10.030
He thought it would comfort me.
In fact, he was right.

48:10.440 --> 48:13.512
After only 24 hours
I was called back to duty.

48:13.920 --> 48:17.105
Back then, a new trend started:
car bombs.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.953
Still popular today.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.828
They're a blast!

48:22.240 --> 48:24.185
A real blast!

48:25.940 --> 48:29.933
So I arrive at this villa
on the outskirts of Beirut.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.429
Everything is made of gold.

48:38.840 --> 48:42.788
Fancy sinks, marble,
gold fixtures and all that stuff.

48:44.960 --> 48:49.192
An officer sits in front of the TV.
He doesn't look at me.

48:49.600 --> 48:52.626
He keeps repeating:
"Fast forward."

48:53.720 --> 48:55.392
Fast forward.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.428
<i>THE PLUMBER COMES 2</i>

48:57.980 --> 49:01.871
<i>I'm here to check your plumbing.</i>
<i>- Down</i> here.

49:07.300 --> 49:11.293
<i>Have you seen my tool?</i>
- <i>Which tool?</i>

49:17.401 --> 49:17.890
Fast forward.

49:30.057 --> 49:31.046
Stop.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.144
He changes the tape and says:

49:45.560 --> 49:49.508
We received a tip-off
about a red Mercedes.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.512
It's coming to blow up your men.
- So?

49:51.920 --> 49:54.150
Blow it up first.

49:54.560 --> 49:57.427
Every red Mercedes?
- Are you an idiot?

49:58.040 --> 49:59.951
Did the Mercedes come?

50:00.600 --> 50:05.788
We waited all night
for the exploding Mercedes,

50:06.200 --> 50:08.953
for this impending disaster.

50:44.360 --> 50:49.263
Then, in the middle of the night,
the phone rang.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.033
Bashir is dead.

50:53.160 --> 50:54.593
Which Bashir?
- Bashir Gemayel,

50:55.080 --> 50:57.230
the elected president of Lebanon.

50:57.920 --> 51:02.107
A brother, an ally, a Christian.
Murdered.

51:02.840 --> 51:06.708
Wake everyone up.
You'll be in Beirut in two hours!

51:07.240 --> 51:10.471
<i>I don't remember much</i>
<i>about the flight to Beirut,</i>

51:10.840 --> 51:14.674
<i>except that I was having</i>
<i>obsessive thoughts about death.</i>

51:15.040 --> 51:18.703
<i>Because my girlfriend Yaeli</i>
<i>had dumped me the week before.</i>

51:19.120 --> 51:21.907
<i>Death would be my revenge.</i>

51:22.320 --> 51:25.073
<i>She would be ridden with guilt</i>

51:25.480 --> 51:27.345
<i>for the rest of her life.</i>

51:31.080 --> 51:33.571
<i>While fantasizing about my death,</i>

51:34.580 --> 51:36.070
<i>we approach Beirut.</i>

51:36.240 --> 51:38.708
<i>A city with hotels, beaches,</i>

51:39.580 --> 51:41.104
<i>and people scurrying about.</i>

51:41.480 --> 51:44.233
<i>We land at the international airport.</i>

51:44.640 --> 51:49.703
<i>Our Hercules army helicopter</i>
<i>lands next to jets from Air France, TWA,</i>

51:50.000 --> 51:51.991
<i>and British Airways.</i>

51:52.740 --> 51:55.823
<i>I was excited</i>
<i>like I was going on a trip abroad,</i>

51:56.080 --> 51:58.753
<i>excited all over.</i>

52:06.200 --> 52:08.225
<i>At some point I simply take off</i>

52:08.640 --> 52:10.665
<i>and walk into the terminal.</i>

52:11.720 --> 52:14.427
<i>It felt as if I was on a leisure trip,</i>

52:15.820 --> 52:18.186
<i>a sort of hallucination.</i>

52:19.000 --> 52:20.706
<i>Like standing in a terminal</i>

52:21.080 --> 52:23.833
<i>waiting to choose my destination.</i>

52:24.080 --> 52:27.311
<i>Before that '80s departures board,</i>

52:27.720 --> 52:30.951
<i>the choice is all mine.</i>

52:31.740 --> 52:34.072
<i>I see the 14:10 to London,</i>

52:34.400 --> 52:36.425
<i>the 15:20 to Paris,</i>

52:36.760 --> 52:37.943
<i>the 16:00 to New York...</i>

52:40.680 --> 52:41.863
<i>I wander through the terminal</i>
<i>and</i> see <i>the duty-free shops:</i>

52:44.640 --> 52:47.313
<i>jewellery, tobacco,</i>

52:47.720 --> 52:48.744
<i>alcohol....</i>

52:49.160 --> 52:53.233
<i>While I'm still on this trip,</i>
<i>I suddenly realize what's going on.</i>

52:53.640 --> 52:57.030
<i>Through the window I see</i>

52:57.400 --> 53:01.894
<i>that all the TWA and Air France planes</i>
<i>are just bombed- out shells.</i>

53:03.420 --> 53:04.887
<i>And the shops are empty,</i>

53:05.560 --> 53:07.107
<i>they've long since been looted.</i>

53:07.520 --> 53:11.889
<i>And the schedule board</i>
<i>hasn't changed for months.</i>

53:13.500 --> 53:15.889
<i>Then I start to hear sounds, voices.</i>

53:16.860 --> 53:20.387
<i>I hear shelling in the city</i>
<i>and the bombing by the air force.</i>

53:21.620 --> 53:22.791
<i>Slowly I begin to realize where I am</i>

53:23.160 --> 53:25.913
<i>and I am afraid</i>
<i>of what will happen next.</i>

53:30.560 --> 53:34.394
<i>We start walking</i>
<i>from the airport to the city.</i>

53:34.800 --> 53:37.985
<i>Tall high-rise hotels</i>
<i>hover above us.</i>

53:38.920 --> 53:41.024
<i>The sea is at our side.</i>

53:48.560 --> 53:53.873
<i>We walk along a promenade</i>
<i>towards a large junction.</i>

53:54.960 --> 53:59.750
<i>Then we come under sniper fire</i>
<i>from the upper floors of a hotel.</i>

54:00.760 --> 54:06.153
<i>We can't see where it's coming from</i>
<i>or who is shooting.</i>

54:06.560 --> 54:11.111
<i>A wounded soldier was lying at the</i>
<i>junction, but we couldn't get to him.</i>

54:11.640 --> 54:13.346
<i>We were scared to death.</i>

54:25.800 --> 54:27.665
<i>Then, in the middle of this hell,</i>

54:28.080 --> 54:32.471
<i>that TV correspondent</i>
<i>Ron Ben- Yishai suddenly shows up.</i>

54:33.080 --> 54:37.983
<i>He's walking upright,</i>
<i>dodging bullets like Superman.</i>

54:38.400 --> 54:42.393
<i>Strolling along as if nothing's wrong,</i>
<i>while bullets whiz past him.</i>

54:42.960 --> 54:46.873
<i>In front of him, a terrified cameraman</i>
<i>crawls forward.</i>

54:47.280 --> 54:52.070
<i>Trembling with fear,</i>
<i>he can't</i> see <i>beyond his helmet.</i>

54:52.620 --> 54:54.986
It was a large junction.

54:55.900 --> 55:00.883
One lane led directly
into Hamra street,

55:02.020 --> 55:04.386
to the West Beirut district of Hamra.

55:05.400 --> 55:08.892
I remember the sizzling sound,
a sort of hissing noise...

55:09.540 --> 55:13.385
They were firing masses of RPGs,
and it sounded

55:14.280 --> 55:16.225
like a Native American
arrow-shooting range.

55:16.640 --> 55:19.985
Before an RPG explodes,
it makes this hissing noise.

55:21.960 --> 55:24.588
You don't hear an explosion,

55:24.960 --> 55:28.953
but just this hissing,
then the walls shattering.

55:29.960 --> 55:35.444
During all this,
civilians are seen on balconies:

55:36.460 --> 55:37.449
women, children,

55:38.160 --> 55:42.267
and old people are watching
as if it were a film.

55:55.120 --> 56:00.103
They are shooting at us
from all directions.

56:05.920 --> 56:08.309
And we can't get across.

56:08.720 --> 56:12.554
Throughout my military service
I was a MAG shooter.

56:13.100 --> 56:15.091
During my officer's training, I thought,

56:15.720 --> 56:19.304
"You've used a MAG for so long,
why not try something else?"

56:19.860 --> 56:20.349
So they gave me a Galil.

56:21.560 --> 56:27.271
And while they're shooting at us
from all directions,

56:28.000 --> 56:32.630
I realize that I can't shoot
with the Galil like I could before.

56:33.600 --> 56:37.912
I missed the good old MAG
that I was familiar with.

56:38.800 --> 56:42.031
So I say to Erez,
"Erez, do me a favor.

56:44.520 --> 56:48.832
Give me your MAG.
I won't make it across with the Galil.

56:48.840 --> 56:51.729
Give me your MAG
and we'll cross the street.

56:52.740 --> 56:53.229
I'll shoot better."

56:54.760 --> 56:57.866
He says, " Frenkel, are you nuts?

56:58.280 --> 57:02.705
They're attacking us!
Stop babbling and shoot!"

57:05.600 --> 57:07.864
I finally realize that I must

57:07.960 --> 57:11.145
take drastic steps.
I grab him and say,

57:11.160 --> 57:17.633
"Listen, Erez, give me the MAG,
or I'll take it by force!"

57:41.360 --> 57:43.624
Whether an eternity
or just a minute,

57:44.120 --> 57:46.190
there was Frenkel at the junction

57:46.600 --> 57:49.751
with bullets flying past him
in every direction.

57:50.160 --> 57:52.788
Instead of crossing the junction,

57:53.200 --> 57:56.112
I saw him dancing, as if in a trance.

57:57.240 --> 58:00.869
He cursed the shooters.
Like he wanted to stay there forever.

58:01.280 --> 58:05.705
As if he wanted to show off
his waltz amid the gunfire,

58:06.120 --> 58:08.748
with the posters of Bashir
above his head.

58:09.160 --> 58:12.345
And Bashir's followers

58:12.760 --> 58:14.671
preparing their big revenge
just 200 yards away:

58:15.080 --> 58:18.550
The Sabra and Shatila massacre.

58:28.480 --> 58:31.631
I'm starting to remember.

58:32.240 --> 58:35.186
I've met people,
I've heard stories...

58:35.780 --> 58:37.270
Stories about myself.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.269
I didn't want to believe them.

58:41.520 --> 58:44.592
So what can't you remember?

58:45.140 --> 58:49.634
The day of the massacre.
I can remember everything else.

58:50.640 --> 58:54.633
I don't understand
why people were so surprised

58:55.240 --> 58:58.073
that the Phalangists
carried out the massacre.

58:58.480 --> 59:01.131
I knew all along
how ruthless they were.

59:05.720 --> 59:09.668
During the storming of Beirut
we were in the slaughterhouse.

59:09.720 --> 59:13.133
Where?
- The slaughterhouse, that junk yard

59:14.140 --> 59:18.634
where they took the Palestinians,
interrogated them, and executed them.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.907
It was like being on an LSD trip.

59:29.480 --> 59:32.313
They carried body parts
of murdered Palestinians

59:32.720 --> 59:34.904
preserved in jars of formaldehyde.

59:37.200 --> 59:41.705
They had fingers, eyeballs,
anything you wanted.

59:47.240 --> 59:49.868
And always pictures of Bashir.

59:50.600 --> 59:53.831
Bashir pendants, Bashir watches,
Bashir this, Bashir that...

59:54.240 --> 59:59.906
Bashir was to them
what David Bowie was to me.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.592
A star, an idol,
a prince, admirable.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.393
I think they even felt
an eroticism for him.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.666
Totally erotic.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.466
Their idol was about to become king.
We were the ones to crown him.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.510
The next day he was murdered.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.390
It was obvious they'd avenge his death
in some perverse way.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.273
It was as if their wife
had been murdered.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.865
This was about family honor,
which runs deep.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.183
Why did you come back?

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.763
I'm still having these hallucinations
about the massacre on the beach.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.230
And you're there with me.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.032
You're crazy.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.551
You're obsessed.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.311
Beach? What are you talking about?
Who was on the beach that night?

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.665
What beach?

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.823
I've reached a dead end.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.347
I can't find anyone
who was with me at the massacre.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.907
No one who was with me

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.871
has any solid memories
of the days of the massacre.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.272
I only have this one vision.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.027
And Carmi, the only person in my vision,
denies being there with me.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.670
It's still real.
- It's a vision.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.913
But it's yours. Shall I explain?
- Yes.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.791
What does the sea symbolize in dreams?
Fear. Feelings.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.067
The massacre frightens you,
makes you uneasy. You were close to it.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.027
That doesn't help me much.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.423
Your interest in the massacre developed
long before it happened.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.907
Your interest in the massacre
stems from another massacre.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.586
Your interest in those camps
is actually about the "other" camps.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.752
Were your parents in camps?
- Yes.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.473
Auschwitz?
- Yes.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.352
So the massacre has been with you
since you were six.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.753
You lived through the massacre
and those camps.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.467
Your only solution
is to find out what really happened

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.546
in Sabra and Shatila.
Seek out people.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.753
Find out what really happened,
ask who was there.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.232
Get details and more details.
That way...

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.988
Then maybe you can find out
where you were exactly.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.311
and what role you played.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.829
On that day we were sent
to a certain post.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.869
It was actually on a hill.
This hill

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.072
was opposite the western sector
of the refugee camp.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.707
From where I was,
I could see the settlement houses.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.668
There was occasional shooting.
We tried to locate them

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.866
and retaliate.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.108
The Christian Phalangist forces
began to arrive.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.592
In full kit,
soldiers in Israeli uniforms

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.343
took position behind tanks.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.906
I was called for a briefing.
It was in English.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.553
What was it about?
- They told us that the Christians

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.052
would enter the camp
and we would give them cover.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.106
Once they had purged the camps.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.590
we would seize control.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.786
Purged of what?
- Palestinian Terrorists.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.150
The next morning,
they began to bring out civilians.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.749
The civilians were led out of the camps

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.709
in a long line.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.624
The Phalangists watched on,
constantly shouting at them

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.304
and occasionally firing into the air.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.107
There were women, old people,

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.025
and children walking in a line
towards the stadium.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:56.144
From inside the tank, did you wonder
where they were taking them?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.390
Did you think about it?

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.790
Not really, because wherever we went,

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.951
an announcement was made
upon entering a camp.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:10.832
Civilians were ordered out.
Those remaining were considered rebels.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:16.472
It seemed quite natural
to say to the residents,

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.986
"If you don't want to get hurt,
then come out!"

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:46.954
On that day I drove to Docha,
a city on the coast.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.451
It had
an Israel Defense Forces landing field.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.629
On the way,

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.191
many Phalangist
half-track vehicles appeared.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:03.152
They shouted with joy
as they headed towards the airfield.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.553
At the airfield,
I met a Colonel friend.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.310
He told me,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.352
"Have you heard
what's happening in the refugee camps?"

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.228
He had pointed to Sabra and Shatila.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.234
"What's happening?" I asked.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.272
"I didn't witness it myself, but they
say there was a terrible massacre."

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:32.664
Palestinians were slaughtered.
I heard they put them on trucks.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.871
I was told that crucifixes
were carved on their chests.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:43.024
They were wounded,
some in critical condition.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.971
They were put on trucks
and taken to an unknown destination.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.967
We saw a Phalangist soldier

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.510
taking an old man away.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.790
At some point we heard shots.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.385
We heard shots.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.306
Then the soldier came out alone.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.951
We asked him what happened.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.663
We couldn't hear him,
but his gestures meant "Boom!"

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.671
We understood that he'd told the man
to kneel down before him.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.026
When he refused, he shot his knees.
When he refused again,

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.225
he shot him in the stomach and head.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.252
Didn't you ever realize

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.747
that trucks were going in empty
and coming out full,

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.752
women and children were brought out
and bulldozers went in?

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.749
That maybe
a massacre is taking place?

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:58.245
Did you wonder
why you didn't realize earlier?

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.243
Yes, of course.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.243
I realized something was happening
only when my men told me.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.823
From the top of their tanks,

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.950
they started shouting,
"They are shooting people!"

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.872
They claim that people were lined up
against the well and shot.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.912
So I called my commanding officer.

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:41.386
I told him what I heard
was going on in the camps.

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:47.024
He said, " We know about it.
It's under control. We reported it."

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:51.630
As far as I was concerned,
the army was handling it.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.031
Where was the operations room,
the headquarters?

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.593
About 100 yards away.
On top of a very tall building.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.789
How tall?
- Tall enough to see everything.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.306
They surely had a better view
than I did.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.345
I didn't want to walk around at night,
so I drove

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.150
to my place in Bahabda.
I had an apartment in Beirut.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.304
Micha Friedman was with me.
We decided to make dinner.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:53.307
Micha invited the guys from
the regiment of the 211th Brigade.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.907
During the meal,
the regiment commander took me aside.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.348
He said: " Ron,

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.027
my men say there's a massacre
going on in the camps."

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.910
He mentioned one or two incidents,

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.089
saying a family was seen shot.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.092
I asked him again,
"Did you see it yourself?"

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.087
"I didn't", he said,
"but my soldiers told me about it.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:27.087
The officers sitting here did, too."
We talked about it over dinner later.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.992
As soon as they left at 11:30 pm,

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.032
I knocked back a whiskey
and phoned Defense Minister Arik Sharon.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.631
At his ranch.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.583
Arik was half asleep.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.484
I said, "I've heard
there's a massacre going on, Arik.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:55.994
They are slaughtering Palestinians.
We have to put a stop to it."

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.990
He asked me,
"Did you see it yourself?"

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:07.487
"No", I said, " but there are
several witnesses who saw it."

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.704
"Okay", he said.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.991
"T hanks for bringing it
to my attention. " That was all.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.508
You'd normally say, "I'll check it out,
I'll look into it. " But no!

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.028
He said, " Thanks for bringing it
to my attention. Happy New Year!"

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.786
Well, something along those lines.
Then back to sleep!

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.067
It's amazing.
A massacre took place,

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.825
it was carried out by
Christian Phalangists.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.431
All around were several circles
of our soldiers

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.189
Every circle had some information.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.387
The first one had the most. However,

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.303
the penny didn't drop.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.188
They didn't realize
they were witnessing a genocide.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.874
What circle were you in?

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.703
In the second or third.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.032
What did you do?

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.383
We stood on a roof
and saw the sky was lit up.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.385
With what?
- Flares.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.668
Flares that must have helped them
do what they were doing.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.586
Did you fire the flares?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.274
Is that important?

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.911
Does it make any difference
if I fired them

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.268
or if I just saw the flares
that helped people shoot others?

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.749
In your state of mind at that time,
it didn't really make a difference.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.869
You can't remember the massacre
because in your opinion,

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.546
the murderers and those around them
are the same circle.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.747
You felt guilty at the age of 19.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.344
Unwillingly,
you took on the role of the Nazi.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.992
You were there firing flares,
but you didn't carry out the massacre.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.471
I woke up at 5 or 5:30,
and I woke everyone up,

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.425
the whole team.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.912
Then I drove to Sabra and Shatila.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.951
When I arrived there...

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.625
What a mess!

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:34.373
You know that picture
from the Warsaw ghetto?

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.366
The one with the kid
holding his hands in the air?

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.903
That's just how the long line of women,

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.312
old people and children looked.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.587
I thought about
going to Brigadier Amos's headquarters,

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.708
but as I was leaving,
Amos suddenly turned up.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.906
He drove to the head of the convoy.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.268
His angry gestures
forced them to stop.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.672
And that was the end of it.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.307
The Phalangists
withdrew back up the street.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.111
The women and children
returned to the camp.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.784
The Palestinians?
- Yes.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.193
I said to my men,
"We're going in with them...

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.712
With those women and children.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.910
We'll see what happened in there."

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.107
Inside the camp we saw
a huge amount of rubble.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.432
My eye caught

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.831
a hand, a small hand.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.667
A child's hand
stuck out from the rubble.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.872
I looked a bit closer and saw curls.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.707
A head of curls covered in dust.
It was hard to make out.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:35.604
But it was a head,
exposed up to the nose.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.110
A hand and a head.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.309
My own daughter was the same age
as that little girl.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.269
And she had curly hair, too.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.909
The Palestinians in refugee camps
have houses with courtyards.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.107
These courtyards were full
of bodies of women and children.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.432
The young men had been shot first.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.032
Then the rest of the family
was dealt with.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.990
We entered one alley,
a very narrow alley...

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.233
the width of a man and a half

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.672
That alley was full...

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:23.274
Piled up to the height of a man's chest

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.631
with the bodies of young men.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.830
That's when I became aware
of the results of the massacre.

01:20:30.831 --> 01:20:31.831
