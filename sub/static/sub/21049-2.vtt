WEBVTT

00:14.972 --> 00:16.891
You don't want to keep the baby?

00:20.770 --> 00:22.939
[scoffs] You haven't thought this through.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.567
Are you serious?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.986
That's all I've done!

00:29.071 --> 00:31.698
I'm 23, Colt.
I'm not ready to have a kid.

00:31.781 --> 00:35.410
I've seen how hard it's been on my mom
and Darlene to raise kids by themselves.

00:35.493 --> 00:36.911
But you're not doing this by yourself.

00:36.994 --> 00:38.288
-Colt!
-I'm gonna be there with you.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.583
I'm not gonna be like
Darlene's kid's father.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.002
Or Darlene's other kid's father.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.296
Or your dad. Or...

00:46.796 --> 00:48.006
Darlene's dad.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.634
Colt, do you love me?

00:55.097 --> 00:56.306
I mean...

00:57.640 --> 00:58.725
I think you're great.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.561
Well, I don't love you.

01:02.895 --> 01:04.397
And what about Abby?

01:04.481 --> 01:06.066
Don't you wanna be with her?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.692
It's not about what I want anymore.

01:07.775 --> 01:09.944
It's... This isn't about me,
it's about this kid!

01:10.695 --> 01:12.114
We're gonna have to make sacrifices.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.283
Yeah, well, when I have kids,
I want it to be with someone I love!

01:16.743 --> 01:19.370
Colt, when it's someone who loves me,
I want a real family!

01:19.454 --> 01:21.498
Come on, everybody's family's fucked up.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.666
It's the normal ones
you gotta worry about!

01:23.750 --> 01:26.544
Every time they catch a serial killer
on the news, they're like...

01:26.628 --> 01:29.756
"He came from such a normal family.
We never saw this coming."

01:30.757 --> 01:32.759
I don't wanna talk about it, Colt.

01:34.051 --> 01:35.553
I made up my mind.

01:39.682 --> 01:40.975
So that's it?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.648
This is wrong.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.902
You can't just take the easy way out.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.070
[sighs] Colt.

01:54.822 --> 01:56.283
You should be happy.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.369
[sniffles]

02:00.787 --> 02:01.913
You're off the hook.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.515
[grunts]

02:30.400 --> 02:31.693
Hey, Colt.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.238
Not really in the mood to talk right now.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.032
Great. I'll be in my room if you need me.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.661
Come on, sit down.

02:42.870 --> 02:45.207
We just want you to know
that we're here to help.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.337
Yeah, well, it don't matter.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.631
'Cause Heather ain't
keeping the baby, so...

02:53.715 --> 02:54.549
What?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.176
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.636
I need a beer.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.138
-We're out.
-Fuck this day!

03:04.016 --> 03:06.394
I can't imagine how hard this is for you.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.271
And for Heather, too.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.444
Did what you said.

03:16.946 --> 03:20.617
Told her she wasn't gonna be alone,
we'd do it together, but...

03:23.495 --> 03:24.496
She won't listen.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.081
She's just upset.

03:27.164 --> 03:28.958
Understandable.

03:29.041 --> 03:30.418
She'll come around, do the right thing.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.045
Maybe she already did.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.089
You want her to do this?

03:35.172 --> 03:36.924
No, I'm not saying that.

03:37.925 --> 03:39.261
[scoffs] It's...

03:39.344 --> 03:41.471
it's just that it's Heather's choice.

03:41.554 --> 03:45.350
The last choice you had was
whether or not to wear a condom.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.437
By the way, you chose wrong.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.528
Okay, so, when the kid comes,
it's my responsibility,

03:56.611 --> 03:58.696
but decidin' whether or not it comes,
I don't get a say.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.741
Yes, Colt, that's exactly right.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.451
That's not how I see it.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.037
Colt's got just as much right as Heather.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.790
-Thank you, Dad.
-Shut up.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.879
You're the dipshit
that got yourself into this.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.050
It's Heather's choice
because she has to carry this baby

04:19.133 --> 04:22.429
and it's gonna affect her life a lot more
than it's gonna affect yours.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.681
[beer can cracks open]

04:29.269 --> 04:32.063
-Are you kiddin' me?
-Found one in the crisper.

04:35.983 --> 04:37.151
You tell Abby yet?

04:38.194 --> 04:40.697
No, she's on a skiing trip
with her parents.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.198
What am I supposed to do, leave a text?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.575
[stutters] Or a voicemail?

04:43.658 --> 04:45.242
"Hey, babe, hope you're having fun.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.371
You know how before you left,
I wasn't a father? Call me back."

04:49.956 --> 04:52.083
You better hurry up
before somebody else does.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.461
Who's gonna tell her?
I'm the only one Heather told.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.547
Heather get her pregnancy test
at the Walgreens?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.343
Yeah, so?

05:01.426 --> 05:05.430
Well... I imagine Tina Reynolds
was working behind the counter.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.015
We all know that Tina can't
keep her mouth shut.

05:09.266 --> 05:11.436
I don't even know who Tina is.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.565
Yeah, but Abby and Tina ain't friends.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.734
Yeah, but Tina will tell Bill,
the pharmacist,

05:17.817 --> 05:20.903
who, by the way,
likes to wear women's underwear.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.366
What?

05:27.284 --> 05:28.870
Found that out from Tina.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.498
Yeah. So?
Everyone knows that.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.082
I didn't.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.504
He and I went huntin' together.

05:40.172 --> 05:41.424
What's this got to do with Abby?

05:41.508 --> 05:44.886
Well, Bill and Abby's dad
play poker together, so...

05:44.969 --> 05:46.471
Bill and I slept in the same tent.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.932
[thud]

05:50.933 --> 05:52.309
What the hell was that?

05:52.394 --> 05:54.646
-Sounded like a twelve gauge.
-[gunshot]

05:54.729 --> 05:57.399
[stutters] Why are we going
toward the gunfire?

05:59.275 --> 06:01.110
-[Beau] Mary?
-What are you doin'?

06:01.193 --> 06:02.278
What the hell?

06:02.361 --> 06:04.739
Oh, you go near my fucking daughter again,

06:04.822 --> 06:07.492
you will have bigger problems
than a shot-up truck.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.327
Merry Christmas, Maggie.
We got your cookie tray. It was delicious.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.084
Now her, I can go hunting with.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
[theme song playing]

07:28.740 --> 07:29.741
[air hissing]

07:30.617 --> 07:31.993
Bye-bye, swamp tush.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.327
-[air hissing]
-[sighs]

07:41.002 --> 07:41.919
Oh, yeah.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.506
-Whoa, shit.
-Oh! Hey, dude.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.384
You gotta knock first, man!
Always knock first!

07:50.052 --> 07:51.846
Well, it happened.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.431
Finally walked in on you blowing yourself.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.351
[laughs] What you doing
all the way out here?

07:57.935 --> 07:58.769
Brought you lunch.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.481
Oh, shit, well... already ate.

08:03.357 --> 08:07.695
So... how is it being the boss
of the Care Bears' Ranch?

08:07.779 --> 08:10.532
-[chuckles]
-It's My Little Pony Ranch, you dick.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.034
It sucks, man.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.578
Umberto's sick.
Half my crew didn't show up.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.788
The other half showed up late
and hungover.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.833
You know, I ain't never been
the most sober person in the room before.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.043
I don't like it.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.212
Yeah. [sucks teeth]

08:25.296 --> 08:27.173
-Think you're having a bad day?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:27.256 --> 08:30.301
Your batshit-crazy girlfriend showed up
at the house with a shotgun,

08:30.384 --> 08:31.844
blew the windows out of our truck.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.596
Why the hell she do that?

08:35.014 --> 08:36.641
Also, that's kinda super hot.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.727
What was she wearing?
American flag bikini?

08:40.686 --> 08:41.562
Yeah.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.815
She found out Heather was pregnant,
so in the dead of winter,

08:43.898 --> 08:46.150
she put on a bikini to come
shoot the windows out the truck.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.110
Oh, shit, dude.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.405
She is gonna be so pissed at me
for not telling her about Heather.

08:51.488 --> 08:55.577
Yeah, this whole situation
just really sucks for you.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.244
Is there anything I can do to help?

08:57.328 --> 09:00.414
I know you're being sarcastic,
but pass me a beer.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.710
Gets worse.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.214
Heather's gettin' a bortion.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.551
Wow.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.930
Well, dodged a bullet.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.267
No, I want her to keep it.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.603
I think bortion's wrong.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.355
Yeah, no, I hear ya.

09:25.272 --> 09:29.694
Wait. Hang on a second.
Are you saying... "bortion"?

09:30.987 --> 09:33.114
Yeah. I'm anti-bortion.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.365
[chuckles]

09:34.448 --> 09:36.868
What are you laughing at, man?
There ain't nothing funny about bortions.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.829
[chuckles] No, dude, you're right.
Uh, sorry about that.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.873
Um, I mean, did you guys
ever maybe talk

09:41.956 --> 09:45.042
about putting the kid up for... doption?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.004
It's "adoption."

09:48.087 --> 09:51.465
It's "abortion" and you're a dumbass.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.136
Whatever. [sucks teeth]

09:55.219 --> 09:57.346
I just gotta figure out
how I'm gonna tell Abby.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.182
Tell Abby? What you talking about?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.643
You ain't gonna tell Abby shit.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.894
You just got away with it, dude.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.648
You think every time I drive drunk
I get home and I call the cops? No.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.441
I pull over, I pick up the mailbox
I just knocked over,

10:09.525 --> 10:11.527
throw it in my trunk and I keep moving.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.617
Yeah, but if she finds out
from someone else, it's gonna be worse.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.035
Who the hell's gonna tell her?

10:19.118 --> 10:21.537
It's a small town, man.
People find out shit.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.706
-You know Tina Reynolds? Walgreens?
-Yeah. Yeah.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.499
She knows Heather got a pregnancy test.

10:25.582 --> 10:28.711
Doesn't mean anybody's gonna tell
anybody about anything.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.256
Look, dude, I've been buying extra-large
condoms at that place for years.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.135
Still can't get that rumor started.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.936
[knocking on door]

10:49.190 --> 10:50.191
Hey, Beau.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.694
Hey, Joanne. Good to see you.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.572
What brings you by?

10:56.656 --> 11:01.118
Well, I'm going on a two-week cruise
with my daughter and my granddaughter

11:01.202 --> 11:03.412
and I was wondering
if I could borrow your binoculars.

11:03.495 --> 11:05.122
My Bushnells?

11:06.498 --> 11:08.042
Gonna need some collateral.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.795
Oh. Well, okay.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.923
Here are the keys to my house.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.592
You can take in the mail and feed the cat.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.887
-What do you want me to feed it to?
-[chuckles]

11:23.975 --> 11:27.603
Christmas with your daughter
must've gone well if you're taking a trip.

11:27.686 --> 11:28.938
Yeah, I'm excited.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.940
I never went on a cruise before.
Have you?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.608
Once.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.693
The Mekong Delta.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.112
Here you go.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.239
Thanks.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.909
Hey, if you don't have anything to do,
I just made a pot of chili.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.286
Oh, yeah. Sure. That smells good.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.413
What's your secret ingredient? Paprika?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.208
Two cans of Hormel and salt.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.710
[laughs]

11:51.794 --> 11:54.463
That would go good
with a side of cornbread and Prilosec.

11:56.423 --> 11:58.300
So, what's it like being a grandmother?

11:58.384 --> 12:01.220
Oh, it is so great.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.807
Grandkids are like snowmobiles.
You... you don't really wanna own one,

12:04.891 --> 12:06.683
but it's really fun to borrow one
for the weekend.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.063
How was your holiday?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.025
Well, that's kind of a long story.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.111
Hmm. Well, just give me the short version.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.531
I had a better Christmas
on the Mekong Delta.

12:21.448 --> 12:24.035
Oh, my. What happened?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.661
I don't wanna talk about it.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.788
Okay.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.541
But just tell me this, uh,
when I get back from my cruise,

12:30.624 --> 12:32.251
am I gonna find you dead in this house,

12:32.334 --> 12:35.046
face down in a bowl of chili
with Bill O'Reilly on the TV?

12:36.755 --> 12:37.799
If I'm lucky.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.884
Let's sit.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.140
You know, Beau, I think you're addicted
to being alone and miserable.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.724
Oh, that's not true.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.812
The only time I'm not miserable
is when I'm alone.

12:52.479 --> 12:55.566
Do you have any friends?
Anybody you don't hate?

12:55.649 --> 12:59.236
Well, I'm pretty good friends
with Bill down at the pharmacy.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.281
Though I'm not sure I know him
as well as I thought.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.159
You know, you...

13:05.242 --> 13:07.453
you can't live like this.

13:07.536 --> 13:10.789
You gotta go out and meet people.
You need some companionship.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.416
Are you talking about dating?

13:12.499 --> 13:14.961
Oh, hell no. You just got divorced.
You're a mess.

13:16.128 --> 13:21.092
Although, I do like the idea of you
filling out a dating profile right now.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.136
Likes?
Steak and whiskey.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.181
Dislikes?
People who don't like steak and whiskey.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.519
Perfect date?
Going out for steak and whiskey.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.149
So you can see how
this isn't the perfect date then.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.401
[chuckles]

13:39.485 --> 13:42.404
I'm just talking about going out
and having some fun.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.489
I don't do that.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.533
I know.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.286
You don't like change,
but change is coming to you.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.913
So you gotta do something.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.124
Church or bowling or, I don't know,

13:53.207 --> 13:55.877
go to the VFW hall,
do a little square dancing.

13:56.710 --> 14:00.672
I'll dance when I want
in the shape that I want.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.304
Hey, baby.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.931
Look who stopped off at the Colonel.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.601
Did you know that your shithead brother
knocked up my dumbass daughter?

14:12.684 --> 14:13.769
What?

14:14.770 --> 14:16.438
That is news to me.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.150
You want grilled or crispy?

14:19.233 --> 14:23.195
Rooster, you have one chance
to tell me the truth

14:23.279 --> 14:24.906
or you are gonna look like your truck.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.824
You did something to my truck? What?

14:30.077 --> 14:32.454
Fine, all right? He told me
the other night at midnight Mass.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.165
At church?

14:34.248 --> 14:37.626
Jeez! We went home together that night.
You didn't say anything?

14:37.709 --> 14:39.586
What are you mad at me for?
You just said I had one chance!

14:39.670 --> 14:42.048
I lied. Like you did to me.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.800
Oh. So call it even?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.344
I am your girlfriend!

14:47.428 --> 14:49.180
It is your responsibility to tell me

14:49.263 --> 14:51.140
if your brother screws up
my daughter's life!

14:51.682 --> 14:54.685
God! The one daughter I thought
would not be a total screw-up!

14:55.269 --> 14:56.395
Shit.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.480
Darlene, you home?

15:00.107 --> 15:01.733
[sighs] Okay, we're good.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.655
[sighs] Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I'm in a shitty spot here.

15:06.738 --> 15:08.908
I promised my brother
I wouldn't say anything to anybody.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.409
I am not just anybody.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.662
I am the person who does that thing.

15:13.745 --> 15:16.332
That thing you like with the thumb
and the cucumber, that's me!

15:16.415 --> 15:18.167
I do that.

15:21.878 --> 15:23.172
And I appreciate that.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.717
But this is not my fault, okay?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.928
And to be honest,
it's not just Colt's fault, either.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.763
Oh, tread real careful here, Rooster.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.766
Look, I'm just saying it takes two people
to make a baby. You know?

15:34.850 --> 15:37.394
And not for nothing,
but you Roth girls are mighty fertile.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.106
In case you hadn't noticed,
it's like a damn Gymboree around here.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.441
You should leave.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.236
You know what? I will.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.696
I don't need this.
I didn't do nothing wrong.

15:47.779 --> 15:48.948
I had a shit day at work

15:49.031 --> 15:50.992
and I came over here
to do the two things we love.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.493
Eat chicken and have sex.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.580
And it doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.125
Right?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.336
Get out.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.588
-God.
-Fine. I will.

16:04.671 --> 16:06.923
I'll take my chicken and myself.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.800
Finish them both off in my car!

16:24.150 --> 16:25.151
Abby.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.194
Hey.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.363
What are you doing here?

16:30.031 --> 16:32.574
Wow. I got a warmer welcome
from the Walmart greeter.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.619
-[chuckles] No. No! Come on. I was...
-[laughs]

16:35.702 --> 16:38.830
I just... wasn't expecting
to see you till tomorrow.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.791
I know. Well...

16:40.874 --> 16:43.544
two nights alone on a mountain
with my parents was enough.

16:44.211 --> 16:48.799
I had to sleep on the pull-out
in the family room. Ugh.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.426
Mmm...

16:51.177 --> 16:55.472
The only thing more annoying than my dad
making coffee at 5:30 in the morning

16:55.556 --> 16:56.932
is my mom saying:

16:57.016 --> 16:59.268
[imitates Janice] "Chuck, be quiet.
Abby's still sleeping.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.436
Did you take your vitamins?"

17:00.519 --> 17:02.104
[imitates Chuck]
"I don't need the damn vitamins!"

17:02.188 --> 17:04.773
[imitates Janice]
"Well, Dr. Randall says you do."

17:06.442 --> 17:08.402
[imitates Chuck] "Janice,
do we have to do this now?"

17:08.485 --> 17:09.986
[in normal voice]
Oh, they fucking did it then.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.450
Anyway, still smoking.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.786
That sounds really tough.

17:19.871 --> 17:22.166
[sighs] I'm just happy
to be here with you.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.960
-[chuckles]
-Stress free, no drama.

17:27.629 --> 17:28.839
Yeah.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.967
No drama. [chuckles]

17:34.511 --> 17:35.721
What the hell happened to your truck?

17:36.888 --> 17:39.891
[both chuckle]

17:40.392 --> 17:41.852
-Yeah...
-Yeah.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.103
Uh...

17:43.729 --> 17:47.108
Rooster, uh, bet me I couldn't shoot
a beer bottle blindfolded.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.484
Long story short...

17:48.567 --> 17:52.071
I kept hearing glass break,
so I kept shooting. [chuckles]

17:53.864 --> 17:55.324
That's a stupid bet. [chuckles]

17:55.407 --> 17:58.244
Yeah, well, we were drinking.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.745
Why didn't you just say that?

17:59.828 --> 18:02.706
You got drunk and you shot up your truck.
We've all been there.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.043
I missed you.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.880
I missed you.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.555
[both chuckle]

18:18.639 --> 18:19.890
You gonna invite me in?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.558
-Oh, yeah, come on, of course.
-[laughs]

18:21.642 --> 18:23.394
-[sighs] All right.
-[sighs]

18:23.477 --> 18:25.771
-Done smoking for the night.
-Hmm.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.523
Mama needs a drink!

18:29.983 --> 18:31.443
[laughs]

18:31.527 --> 18:33.779
So, how was your Christmas?

18:35.281 --> 18:36.573
Good.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.203
Hey, is your dad home?
'Cause I got him a gift.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.331
It's a sign that says,
"Solicitors welcome."

18:45.874 --> 18:47.584
But then
in tiny letters underneath it says,

18:47.668 --> 18:49.002
"To run for their lives."

18:49.961 --> 18:51.087
[chuckles]

18:51.172 --> 18:53.424
'Cause I know he likes to shoot things.

18:54.966 --> 18:57.136
-[both chuckle]
-That's pretty good.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.221
No, he's... he's out, actually.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.432
-Mmm!
-[sighs]

19:01.515 --> 19:02.558
[sighs]

19:02.641 --> 19:05.352
What you wanna do?
Just watch TV?

19:05.436 --> 19:08.730
Uh, sure, but I was hoping we could do

19:08.814 --> 19:11.107
a little something better than watch TV...

19:12.067 --> 19:14.361
-"Solicitors welcome."
-[chuckles]

19:16.322 --> 19:17.489
Oh.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.409
Yeah.

19:20.992 --> 19:23.162
You know, I... I gotta...

19:23.995 --> 19:25.414
[sighs] I'm beat.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.666
-Uh-huh.
-I...

19:27.749 --> 19:29.293
Is it okay if we just hang out?

19:31.044 --> 19:33.505
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.631
Cool.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.260
[laughs]

19:40.262 --> 19:41.847
Hey, you know what might
make you feel better?

19:41.930 --> 19:44.057
-What's that?
-A little fuckin'.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.351
[chuckles]

19:54.109 --> 19:55.777
[indistinct chatter]

19:58.113 --> 20:01.408
Maggie, I'd like you to meet
my girlfriend, Shirley.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.993
It's nice to meet you, Shirley.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.705
Girlfriend's a little heavy, Hank.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.541
So let's just say second cousins.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.378
How'd you guys meet?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.795
Family reunion.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.388
Hey, Beau. What's going on?

20:22.471 --> 20:25.932
I just came to have a drink.
Make some new friends.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.518
[laughing]

20:27.601 --> 20:28.685
Okay.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.732
Hey, Hank. Ma'am.

20:33.815 --> 20:36.235
Beau, this is Shirley.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.694
[Shirley] Lookie here.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.613
A silver fox.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.158
What do you do, Shirley?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.910
I have an Etsy shop.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.996
-What the hell is an Etsy?
-[chuckles]

20:48.079 --> 20:52.167
It's a global online marketplace
for amateur craftsmen and artisans.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.339
I take old shit from garage sales,

20:57.423 --> 21:01.802
and I jack up the price
and then I sell it to rich assholes.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.266
-I like you.
-[laughs]

21:11.937 --> 21:12.979
Hey.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.231
All right, I'm done here.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.489
Well, it's nice to see you
and your dad talking.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.618
Yeah. Not my first choice,
running into him here.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.078
Already having a shit day.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.247
[exhales] Any chance you're gonna
deal with that by not getting drunk?

21:33.417 --> 21:37.212
You know, you got weird moral lines
for a woman who owns a bar, Mom.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.717
So what happened?

21:42.426 --> 21:45.136
[sighs] New job's killing me.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.889
Got into a fight with Mary
over my dumbass brother...

21:47.973 --> 21:49.308
Now I gotta go home to Umberto

21:49.391 --> 21:51.184
and five other guys
in some shitty apartment.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.521
You know, one of them assholes
ate my Cocoa Puffs.

21:55.564 --> 21:59.192
Yeah, I know you've always been
very protective about your cereal.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.571
You know, I have an idea.

22:02.654 --> 22:06.617
Yeah, no, I know.
Deer shit looks just like Cocoa Puffs.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.204
But, Mom, I don't have time
to go gather it.

22:14.124 --> 22:17.168
-What if you lived in the huntin' cabin?
-Dad's huntin' cabin?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.171
Yeah, that'd be great, you know?
We could be neighbors.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.174
I can swing by his place
and borrow some sugar.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.886
He can swing by my place
and skin me in my sleep.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.098
That's my huntin' cabin.
I got it in the divorce.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.643
Think about it.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.687
[sighs heavily]

22:36.480 --> 22:37.606
'Sup?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.567
'Sup?

22:40.651 --> 22:43.236
Rooster, meet my girlfriend/cousin.

22:48.825 --> 22:49.951
Been there.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.425
Oh. Sorry, we're closed.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.635
Sign says you're open till eight o'clock.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.429
It's only 7:55.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.806
Beau Bennett.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.808
Brenda Sanders.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.646
Well, we've got some brown
and some blonde on the floor already.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.940
I guess we could add some gray.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.233
Where you been?

23:22.317 --> 23:26.780
Well, I've been getting my hair cut
at Sport Clips up near Grand Junction.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.782
Oh, so what brought you back?

23:28.865 --> 23:31.452
They started putting soccer on the TVs.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.869
[laughs]

23:32.953 --> 23:35.914
Well, they didn't do you
any favors with your hair.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.042
Sit down.
Might not be too late to save you.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.335
Thanks.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.010
Good to see you, Brenda.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.762
Good to see you, too, Beau.

23:50.846 --> 23:54.182
Just the haircut
or we gonna shave the 'stache, too?

23:54.265 --> 23:55.976
There are some things
you don't joke about.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.478
Ah. Okay.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.778
So, what do you think?

24:08.530 --> 24:10.782
[sighs] I think if it looked this shitty
in eighth grade,

24:10.866 --> 24:13.619
never would've gotten to second base
with Kathy Bell. [chuckles]

24:15.161 --> 24:17.205
Look, does it need a little work? Sure.

24:17.288 --> 24:19.207
But that's why I'm letting you live here.

24:19.290 --> 24:23.086
I figure, by the time you get it in shape,
I'll kick your ass out and I'll move in.

24:23.169 --> 24:24.420
[chuckles]

24:26.089 --> 24:28.258
[grunts] There's no water.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.969
Well, you don't wash your hands anyway.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.516
Oh! [sighs]

24:36.558 --> 24:37.768
There's a rat in the fridge.

24:45.441 --> 24:47.653
That's gotta be about five years old,
you know.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.447
Yeah, it's warm, too.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.160
Okay, you got a pet. You got a beer.
What more do you want?

24:55.243 --> 24:57.663
[chuckles] Yeah. Could be pretty cool.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.957
Colt and I did have a ton of fun in here
back in high school.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.084
We'd sneak in
in the middle of the night and...

25:04.169 --> 25:05.461
We'd study.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.965
You guys came out here to smoke pot.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.050
You knew that?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.344
I'm your mother.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.597
I also know you only got to first base
with Kathy Bell.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.685
Hey, over the bra counts, Mom.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.229
So you wanna live here or not?

25:24.606 --> 25:25.941
I don't know. I mean...

25:26.525 --> 25:28.360
I guess I could fix it up, but...

25:29.027 --> 25:30.779
I'm 35 years old.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.656
I finally moved out of the ranch house.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.741
Now what? I gotta just, like,
rely on my mommy?

25:34.825 --> 25:37.118
Well, don't let your pride get in the way.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.246
This is simple.
You need a place to live and I got one.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.208
Feels weird. Like I'm taking charity.

25:43.291 --> 25:46.169
Oh... Well, I could charge you rent.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.337
No, I'm good.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.466

25:56.847 --> 25:59.766
I gotta leave it a little long here
to cover up some of that red neck.

26:06.397 --> 26:08.734
What do I care what the back looks like?

26:10.276 --> 26:12.445
That's everybody else's problem.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.407
You know, it's that attitude
that gave us the mullet.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.784
[chuckles]

26:18.744 --> 26:20.954
I'm sorry I haven't been around
for a while.

26:22.497 --> 26:23.498
It's okay.

26:24.499 --> 26:27.293
I kinda figured that
you were just keeping your distance

26:27.377 --> 26:29.880
'cause of all those rumors about us.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.006
Yeah.

26:32.465 --> 26:36.303
Tell you the truth, that whole situation
was kinda hard on Maggie.

26:36.887 --> 26:39.139
I could hide out
at the ranch all day, but...

26:40.056 --> 26:42.893
she had to listen to it in the bar
all the time.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.228
She didn't deserve that.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.481
Yep, believe me, I get it.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.484
A lot of women stopped coming around here

26:51.567 --> 26:54.195
when they thought
I was sleeping with a married man.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.157
I'm sorry if it cost you some business.

26:57.532 --> 26:58.658
It all worked out.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.327
'Cause their husbands all lined up
around the corner.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.249
You always did look
on the bright side of things.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.252
Despite that, I still like ya.

27:10.503 --> 27:11.546
[razor whirring]

27:11.629 --> 27:13.173
I guess I just try real hard

27:13.256 --> 27:16.092
not to be bothered about
what other people think about me.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.304
And when Jim died, I needed a friend.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.598
I'm not gonna apologize for finding one.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.853
I'm also not gonna apologize
for putting ketchup on my mashed potatoes

27:26.937 --> 27:28.563
and mustard on my fries.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.274
You should.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.862
Boy...

27:35.946 --> 27:38.740
we sure did go through
some stuff back then.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.326
Hell, I'm still going through shit.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.244
Oh, I heard.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.621
Rooster's working at Neumann's Hill

27:45.706 --> 27:48.499
and, uh, Colt knocked up
that Roth girl and...

27:49.835 --> 27:52.462
and you and Maggie finalized that divorce.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.881
My God, are there no secrets in this town?

27:54.965 --> 27:57.050
Well, it's just a hazard of the job,
you know.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.427
People tell their hairdresser everything.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.387
But that's why I like
spending time with you

28:01.471 --> 28:03.139
because you are not here to gossip.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.432
That's right.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.895
You heard about Bill down at the pharmacy?

28:10.271 --> 28:12.023
Beau Bennett, you are better than that.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.276
So what have you been up to?

28:16.152 --> 28:18.029
Uh, let's see. Um...

28:18.113 --> 28:20.198
Oh, I got a collie named Dolly.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.410
Silly, I know,
but you would really like her.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.247
You should come hiking with us.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.207
Well, I've never been much for hiking.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.500
If I'm going into the woods,

28:30.583 --> 28:33.253
I'm gonna come out
with a carcass on my shoulder.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.340
Oh, I also got into yoga.

28:37.423 --> 28:40.301
And you should try that.
It would be great for your back.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.429
And if I go into a yoga studio,

28:43.513 --> 28:45.974
I'm gonna come out
with a carcass on my shoulder.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.350
[chuckles]

28:50.186 --> 28:52.230
I've missed this, Beau.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.857
I've missed it, too.

28:56.735 --> 29:00.363
So, what are you gonna gouge me
for this haircut?

29:01.782 --> 29:03.408
I'll tell you what.

29:03.491 --> 29:06.369
You buy me dinner sometime
and we'll call it even.

29:06.452 --> 29:07.871
I can do that.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.291
Just tell me how much this haircut
would've cost

29:11.374 --> 29:13.251
so I'll know where to take you.

29:22.635 --> 29:23.636
Colt?

29:26.222 --> 29:27.265
Hey, Ab.

29:28.058 --> 29:31.644
What are you doing up? I just...
I reached for you and you weren't there.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.897
So... [chuckles]
I went for the light

29:33.980 --> 29:36.566
and knocked over one of your trophies
and it hit me in the forehead.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.320
Thank God you weren't good enough
to win a Heisman,

29:40.403 --> 29:42.488
I'd have a fucking concussion.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.913
Sorry, I just... couldn't sleep.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.457
All right, what's going on?

29:53.333 --> 29:54.542
You don't wanna have sex.

29:54.625 --> 29:57.337
You didn't react to the fact
that I said you sucked at football.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.421
Are you dying?

29:59.965 --> 30:01.507
[chuckles]

30:01.591 --> 30:03.969
You've been acting weird since I got back.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.221
Hmm?

30:11.893 --> 30:13.436
I don't know what to do.

30:16.564 --> 30:19.192
I don't... I don't even know
if I should tell you.

30:19.275 --> 30:20.443
[chuckles]

30:21.402 --> 30:23.488
I mean, how bad could it be?
Oh, my God, your truck.

30:23.571 --> 30:24.823
Did you kill someone?

30:29.327 --> 30:30.370
[exhales] No.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.122
Okay. [laughs]

30:32.205 --> 30:33.164
It's just...

30:41.965 --> 30:43.091
Heather's pregnant.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.137
What?

30:52.017 --> 30:53.601
Heather's pregnant. It's mine.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.232
Jesus, Colt.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.569
No. Abby, I didn't...
I didn't cheat on you.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.656
[stammering] It was the time
that you knew about. I...

31:07.698 --> 31:09.409
I would have told you earlier, but--

31:09.492 --> 31:10.410
Stop.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.872
Stop talking.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.342
