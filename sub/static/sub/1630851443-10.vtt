They know I get it started

02:45.586 --> 02:48.000
Ask me, 'Will I take it easy?'
Told em' that it's harder

02:48.000 --> 02:50.620
Ask me, 'Will I quit?'
Oh no sir, I beg your pardon

02:50.620 --> 02:52.034
They're saying that it's light,

Dime, yo, real talk.

05:31.275 --> 05:33.034
I don't wanna go in there.

05:33.034 --> 05:34.379

05:34.379 --> 05:37.068

05:37.068 --> 05:38.724
Yo, bunch of niggas in there.

I was thinking maybe
we could...you know?

05:44.896 --> 05:47.482
- What?

05:47.482 --> 05:48.827

be disrespectful, I'm just--

06:19.103 --> 06:20.413
Never mind, my bad.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.103

06:26.413 --> 06:29.241
- Well, time...

06:29.241 --> 06:33.344

06:38.241 --> 06:40.862
Alright, look, uh...

06:40.862 --> 06:44.724
Don't get mad at

06:44.724 --> 06:46.586
Can I ask you how much time?

06:46.586 --> 06:48.482
- As long as it takes.

06:48.482 --> 06:54.137
- For...what?

06:54.137 --> 06:55.965
- Me to be comfortable.

06:58.965 --> 07:00.241

07:00.241 --> 07:01.310
No, for real.

start that shit, alright?

07:10.206 --> 07:13.413
You know?

07:13.413 --> 07:15.448

07:29.448 --> 07:32.620

07:34.931 --> 07:38.068
So why you

07:52.034 --> 07:55.931
And I'll untighten mine.

07:55.931 --> 07:57.724
Kiss me?

07:57.724 --> 07:59.413

07:59.413 --> 08:00.517
- Of course.

08:09.379 --> 08:11.689
- Hey. Hey.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.448
Uh, this a decent neighborhood.

08:15.448 --> 08:18.206
You can't be out here fucking

08:46.793 --> 08:48.793
Get your ass in the house.

08:51.137 --> 08:53.620

09:02.620 --> 09:04.206
- Oh, you don't wanna know.

09:29.655 --> 09:33.827
And since you did that...

09:33.827 --> 09:36.068

Look, nigga, if you still
feeling tense,

You gotta do whatever

- I got you.
- Alright.

10:02.827 --> 10:06.758
Doc, welcome to the
other side of the family.

10:08.586 --> 10:10.068
- Thank you, Madam.

10:25.862 --> 10:27.206
-Police, open up.

10:34.793 --> 10:36.655

10:38.827 --> 10:42.068
- Help! He was

What happened?

10:58.827 --> 11:03.517
- I'm trying to tell you,
man, he was raping us.

11:03.517 --> 11:05.068
- And who was he?

11:05.068 --> 11:07.586
- He's somebody that
came to the club.

11:07.586 --> 11:09.310
And then he
kidnapped me and her.

11:09.310 --> 11:11.896
- He looks kind of small
to be able to do that.

11:13.034 --> 11:14.965
- Oh, he had
another guy with him.

11:14.965 --> 11:19.000
We were just supposed to smoke,
fuck, talk,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.310
get high, shit like that, man.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.344
- And, uh...

11:23.344 --> 11:25.310
why was Tina there?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.655
- She was cool.

11:26.655 --> 11:28.379
- Uh-huh.

11:29.827 --> 11:31.689
Did you know that she was
turning State's evidence

11:31.689 --> 11:34.448
against your boss?

11:34.448 --> 11:36.689
- Who? Tina?

11:36.689 --> 11:39.551
- Yeah, Tina.

11:39.551 --> 11:42.172
- I don't know.

11:42.172 --> 11:44.137
- Okay, Belinda.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.344
- It's Blue.

11:45.344 --> 11:48.344
- Belinda, I'm not doing
this with you, okay?

11:48.344 --> 11:50.620
It's late.

11:50.620 --> 11:53.689
Are you gonna turn
on Madam or what?

11:55.068 --> 11:57.344
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yeah, okay.

11:57.344 --> 11:59.482
- I am a victim.
- Are you?

11:59.482 --> 12:01.689
- Yes.

12:01.689 --> 12:03.482
- Fuck, I could
have been killed.

12:03.482 --> 12:05.000
Oh, thank God for your officers.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.689
They saved my life.

12:06.689 --> 12:10.103
- Yeah, see, I don't believe
a thing that you're saying.

12:11.655 --> 12:13.620
- But I'm telling
you the truth.

12:13.620 --> 12:16.137
- Ha, yeah, okay.

12:18.551 --> 12:20.482
- Wait.

12:20.482 --> 12:22.655
I get a phone call?

12:22.655 --> 12:28.793
- You ain't getting shit, but
a long, long jail sentence.

12:28.793 --> 12:30.758
- I didn't do anything.
- Okay.

12:30.758 --> 12:32.379
- I want a lawyer.

12:32.379 --> 12:35.413
- Yeah? You do?

12:35.413 --> 12:37.137
Maybe tomorrow.

12:40.965 --> 12:44.758
- Bitch, now don't
you fuck with me.

12:44.758 --> 12:46.793
Now you know that
shit is illegal.

12:46.793 --> 12:49.758
- Bitch...

12:49.758 --> 12:54.758
you have no idea just how many
agencies

12:54.758 --> 12:57.413
are after you two, do you?

12:59.586 --> 13:01.482
- We are going
to get your asses.

13:01.482 --> 13:03.620
- Ah.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.413
- Lola?

13:10.724 --> 13:13.344
You got any questions?

13:13.344 --> 13:15.000
- Not at this time.

13:16.793 --> 13:18.551
- Alright, then great.

13:18.551 --> 13:20.482
Hey, guys!

13:20.482 --> 13:22.206
Let's take her back.

13:22.206 --> 13:26.896
Let's give Miss Belinda
a little time to think.

13:26.896 --> 13:29.344
- Now you bitches
gonna give me my fucking

13:29.344 --> 13:32.379
phone call, that's what the
fuck y'all both gonna do.

13:34.862 --> 13:36.655
- Good luck.

13:36.655 --> 13:39.344
- Fuck you.

13:48.344 --> 13:49.896
- Hi, Daddy.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.310
Hey, Blue, it's Madam.

13:52.310 --> 13:54.655
You should have called
me back last night.

13:54.655 --> 13:56.034
Look, I came to see my dad,

13:56.034 --> 13:59.448
so you already know how long
that drive is.

13:59.448 --> 14:02.448
Do me a favor, call me
when you get this, okay?

14:06.862 --> 14:08.724
Hi.
- Hi.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.000
- I'm Madam.
- I know who you are.

14:13.379 --> 14:15.689
- What are those?
- Oh, we did this.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.586
We try to find out as much
as we can about our patients.

14:18.586 --> 14:20.517
- Where'd you find these?

14:20.517 --> 14:22.551
- He had them in his bag.

14:22.551 --> 14:23.758
-Really?

14:23.758 --> 14:25.448
How's he doing?

14:25.448 --> 14:26.827
- He's no fuss at all.

14:26.827 --> 14:29.793
He's just--watches TV all day.

14:29.793 --> 14:31.620
- Is he eating well?
- He is.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.586
He is eating.
- Good.

14:33.586 --> 14:37.034
- Uh, may I ask you a question?

14:37.034 --> 14:39.758
This is none of my business.

14:39.758 --> 14:41.068
- Then why are you asking?

14:41.068 --> 14:43.275
- Well, it's about his care.

14:43.275 --> 14:44.827
- Go on.

14:44.827 --> 14:49.000
- Okay, um, since he's been
here, the FBI

14:49.000 --> 14:51.275
has been here to see him twice.

14:52.827 --> 14:54.206
- Really?

14:54.206 --> 14:55.344
- Yeah.

14:55.344 --> 14:58.827
Um, are we in some
kind of danger?

14:58.827 --> 15:00.551
- Look at him.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.586
Does he look dangerous?

15:02.586 --> 15:04.000
-No, not at all.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.172
- Now, yes, he was a gangster.

15:07.172 --> 15:10.758
He used to move a lot of dope,
money, women, all of that.

15:10.758 --> 15:12.551
But he went to jail
for a long time.

15:12.551 --> 15:14.758
He got very sick.

15:14.758 --> 15:18.965
And after fighting to get him
out, they finally released him.

15:18.965 --> 15:23.413
And this is the condition he's
in, so--

15:23.413 --> 15:26.137
Yeah, I just wish I could have
gotten him before, you know?

15:26.137 --> 15:29.034
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's alright.

15:29.034 --> 15:31.103
- They should leave him alone.

15:31.103 --> 15:33.241
- Yeah, they should.

15:33.241 --> 15:35.241
But they won't.
- Well, why?

15:35.241 --> 15:38.482
Do they not believe him?

15:38.482 --> 15:39.655
- I guess not.

15:39.655 --> 15:42.758
- Well, um...

15:42.758 --> 15:48.137
I can attest to the fact that
he is in a really bad state.

15:48.137 --> 15:50.000
- Are you trying to
make me feel worse?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.379
- I'm sorry.

15:51.379 --> 15:53.206
No, I'm sorry.

15:53.206 --> 15:55.275
- Can you excuse us, please?

15:55.275 --> 15:57.620
- No problem.
- Thank you.

16:02.172 --> 16:05.827
I brought you some banana
pudding from Maddy D's,

16:05.827 --> 16:07.448
as you already know.

16:10.275 --> 16:13.517
Alrighty.

16:13.517 --> 16:15.586
Looks like they've
been treating you well.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.137
I'm happy to hear
you've been eating well.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.620
Yeah, I see your face.

16:29.620 --> 16:33.482
That's your favorite.

16:33.482 --> 16:35.241
You look good, Dad.

16:41.137 --> 16:42.655
You like that?

16:42.655 --> 16:44.655
Mm-hmm.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.172
Here a little bit more.

16:47.172 --> 16:53.000
Ooh, mm-hmm, yep.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.172
Daddy, I feel like I'm
losing my fucking mind.

16:56.172 --> 17:00.000
These motherfuckers are trying
to take my club from me.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.896
I just caught two new bodies--

17:03.896 --> 17:05.758
- Are you okay?

17:08.379 --> 17:11.103
Like I was saying, I just
caught two new bodies--

17:18.793 --> 17:22.586
- I just caught two new
bodies--beautiful bodies, and

17:22.586 --> 17:25.862
they are working for me and
making all kind of money.

17:25.862 --> 17:27.482
But I'm gonna get
you a clean towel.

17:27.482 --> 17:29.379
I got a little mess on you.

17:29.379 --> 17:31.689
Take you into the bathroom.
Come on.

17:33.482 --> 17:35.862
Yeah, let's get you
cleaned up, Daddy.

17:55.724 --> 17:58.413
- I'm sorry.

17:58.413 --> 18:01.827
- Daddy.
- Nobody can know.

18:04.379 --> 18:06.344
Don't say nothing.

18:06.344 --> 18:09.068
They're gonna put
me back in there.

18:11.034 --> 18:14.655
- I'm happy you got me away
from your crazy-ass sister.

18:20.137 --> 18:25.206
You know how hard it is for me
to sit here and not hug you

18:25.206 --> 18:29.551
because some fucking
Feds are after me?

18:32.000 --> 18:36.482
- I'm about to shoot your
sister in her fucking head.

18:36.482 --> 18:40.379
She's having sex right
there in front of me.

18:41.862 --> 18:48.551
And this crazy motherfucker,
he's a dark kid with wavy hair.

18:48.551 --> 18:50.068
You know?

18:50.068 --> 18:53.758
Look here, baby girl.

18:53.758 --> 18:57.793
You kill any motherfucker

18:57.793 --> 19:03.517
that's trying to kill you, you
kill him twice.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.379
All this shit that you coming
in here telling me

19:06.379 --> 19:08.379
on these visits...

19:10.172 --> 19:14.068
I didn't raise you to be weak.

19:14.068 --> 19:16.655
You do it for me.

19:16.655 --> 19:23.241
You do it for my
blood that's in you.

19:23.241 --> 19:28.413
'Cause I swear--I swear.

19:28.413 --> 19:32.758
If I could, I would
tear all this shit down.

19:36.482 --> 19:38.862
Okay.

19:38.862 --> 19:40.655
Okay, take me back in there.

19:40.655 --> 19:44.344
Now they got a camera right
there on that dresser.

19:47.241 --> 19:51.758
Next time you come to visit me,
you put your purse up there.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.827
- Daddy, I'm just so
happy that you're okay.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.275
I'm so happy you're okay.

19:59.172 --> 20:02.206
I'm not okay.

20:02.206 --> 20:03.655
They're watching me.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.586
- Is everything okay, dear?
- Uh, yes.

20:07.586 --> 20:10.310
I spilled something on him,
but I got it cleaned up.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.241
- Oh, that's okay,
we'll get that.

20:12.241 --> 20:14.000
-Okay.
- Come on, James.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.241
- So...
- So?

20:33.241 --> 20:35.379
- You leaving?
- Yeah.

20:35.379 --> 20:37.310
You know, I found me a place.

20:37.310 --> 20:40.000
- Can I see it?
- Nah, man.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.379
- Why not?

20:41.379 --> 20:43.620
- Bro, real talk.

20:43.620 --> 20:47.034
It's just something a little
off about you to me, man.

20:47.034 --> 20:48.793
- What you mean?

20:51.241 --> 20:52.896
- I don't trust you, man.

20:52.896 --> 20:54.827
- Wow.

20:54.827 --> 20:56.172
- I mean, I'm sorry, but--

20:56.172 --> 20:57.344
- That hurts.

20:57.344 --> 20:59.241
- It's real, bro.

20:59.241 --> 21:00.793
- So you're moving out?

21:00.793 --> 21:01.965
- Yeah.

21:01.965 --> 21:03.724
Like I said, I found me a place.

21:03.724 --> 21:06.482
Talked to the landlord, she
lives upstairs of the place,

21:06.482 --> 21:09.241
and she take my money today.

21:09.241 --> 21:11.344
And, um, I'm in there.

21:11.344 --> 21:13.758
- So what did Mr. Paul say?

21:13.758 --> 21:15.034
- Mr. Paul?

21:15.034 --> 21:17.793
Shit, man, nothing he can say.

21:17.793 --> 21:19.068
- I guess you right.

21:19.068 --> 21:20.862
- Yeah,
I know I am, nigga.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.310
- Look.

21:23.310 --> 21:24.965
I'm sorry.

21:26.379 --> 21:28.655
Yeah, man, I've been
all in your business.

21:28.655 --> 21:32.551
I just--I'm like proud of you.

21:32.551 --> 21:34.172
Yeah.

21:34.172 --> 21:36.517
Like a lot of dudes don't come
in here and live like you did.

21:36.517 --> 21:38.896
- You came in here, you knew
what you wanted to do,

21:38.896 --> 21:40.344
and you did it.

21:40.344 --> 21:42.000
I just wish I could
have been so lucky.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.551
- Yo, man, you can be.

21:43.551 --> 21:45.344
Nigga, you can do it too.

21:45.344 --> 21:48.172
- I don't have an aunt
helping me get paid, bruh.

21:48.172 --> 21:52.068
- Bruh, that is no excuse, man.

21:52.068 --> 21:53.724
You're better than that.

21:53.724 --> 21:55.758
- Man, yo, I just wish you
could have helped put me on.

21:58.344 --> 22:01.689
- Yeah, look, I'm
sorry about that.

22:01.689 --> 22:05.482
- Well, it didn't work,
so when can I go apply?

22:05.482 --> 22:07.896
- Come on, man, don't
start that again.

22:07.896 --> 22:09.551
- When can I go down there?
What time?

22:09.551 --> 22:13.068
- Alright, chill.
Um, look...

22:13.068 --> 22:16.275
if you go to the club, you
gotta talk to the manager

22:16.275 --> 22:18.620
or the head of security.
Alright?

22:18.620 --> 22:22.310
The manager is Dime,
head of security is Blue.

22:22.310 --> 22:26.241
- Alright. I'll go today.
- No, no.

22:26.241 --> 22:29.517
Bro, how 'bout this?

22:29.517 --> 22:32.344
- Let me tell them that
you're coming first, alright?

22:32.344 --> 22:34.517
- I appreciate that.

22:34.517 --> 22:39.206
- Alright, so, sometime next
week, I'll talk to my aunt,

22:39.206 --> 22:40.655
and I'll tell her to put you on.

22:40.655 --> 22:43.517
But not around no money, okay?

22:43.517 --> 22:44.655
- You think I would
steal from her?

22:44.655 --> 22:46.586
-No.
- Oh.

22:46.586 --> 22:49.931
- But it's not about her, bro.

22:49.931 --> 22:51.965
This is about you.

22:51.965 --> 22:55.068
And trust me, with my aunt, you
don't want them problems,

22:55.068 --> 22:57.275
you hear me?
- Yeah.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.413
I ain't never do that, bruh.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.413
- Alright.
- Alright.

23:04.413 --> 23:05.620
Appreciate it.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.862
- Be careful, man.

23:09.275 --> 23:10.931
- Thanks.

23:35.344 --> 23:37.206
- What the--

23:37.206 --> 23:39.620
What are you doing in here?

23:39.620 --> 23:42.448
- I can't talk here.

23:42.448 --> 23:44.724
- Oh, shit.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.275
-It's all good, man.

23:47.275 --> 23:50.931
- What is going on, Blue?

23:50.931 --> 23:53.379
- I was handling something
for Madam last night.

23:53.379 --> 23:54.896
- What?

23:54.896 --> 23:58.241
- Tell you wasn't me,
just got caught up in it.

23:58.241 --> 23:59.689
- Why is she not
down here then?

23:59.689 --> 24:01.482
- Because she don't know yet.

24:02.551 --> 24:04.000
- Is it bad?

24:06.448 --> 24:08.068
- Yeah.

24:09.793 --> 24:12.655
Well, she need to do something.

24:12.655 --> 24:15.310
- We can't talk here.

24:15.310 --> 24:16.793
- Baby.

24:16.793 --> 24:19.482
- Hey, hey, hey, relax, man.
Relax.

24:19.482 --> 24:21.275
- Damn it, Blue.

24:21.275 --> 24:23.862
You don't even call me last
night, you didn't come home.

24:23.862 --> 24:25.793
And now you up in here for her.

24:25.793 --> 24:27.344
- Yeah.

24:27.344 --> 24:28.931
Don't you do that shit.

24:28.931 --> 24:31.137
- Nah, nah, she
need to get her--

24:31.137 --> 24:32.517
- She?

24:32.517 --> 24:35.379
What the fuck you
talking about she?

24:35.379 --> 24:36.827
She's done a lot for us.

24:36.827 --> 24:39.620
- At what fucking price, Blue?

24:39.620 --> 24:41.068
- Didn't I say we all good?

24:41.068 --> 24:43.068
- We ain't good if
you sitting up in here.

24:43.068 --> 24:44.965
- Alright, listen here.

24:44.965 --> 24:47.724
I need you to get a
message to her for me.

24:47.724 --> 24:49.827
- You know what? I got a message
for her.

24:49.827 --> 24:51.862
- Ah, come on,
with that shit, man.

24:51.862 --> 24:53.551
- No, I'm gonna let
her know exactly--

24:53.551 --> 24:56.103
- Wait, wait, wait,
calm your ass down.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.793
- No, fuck that.

24:57.793 --> 24:59.620
- No, no, no, don't you take
your ass going down there.

24:59.620 --> 25:02.448
I don't know who the
fuck you think you are.

25:02.448 --> 25:04.448
- Are you fucking her too?

25:04.448 --> 25:06.034
- You're gonna do this?

25:06.034 --> 25:08.103
You're gonna do that
shit right here?

25:08.103 --> 25:09.275
- You know what?

25:09.275 --> 25:10.448
I got this.

25:10.448 --> 25:12.344
- No, the fuck you don't.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.034
Yo, Kat!

25:14.034 --> 25:15.172
Kat!

25:15.172 --> 25:17.655
Shit, man, fuck!

25:19.068 --> 25:25.000
- Okay, so we have the GBI
here, Agent Lola Watts.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.793
And I am Detective Davis, I'll
be representing

25:27.793 --> 25:29.965
the City of Atlanta on this.

25:29.965 --> 25:32.689
We will need your assistance to
make sure that this all goes

25:32.689 --> 25:34.862
smoothly, so thank you.

25:34.862 --> 25:37.275
Now, you know what
we have on her.

25:37.275 --> 25:38.965
I sent it in an email.

25:38.965 --> 25:42.379
She is considered to be armed
and dangerous at all times.

25:42.379 --> 25:45.517
Her name is Marlyn Deville,
but she goes by Madam.

25:47.068 --> 25:48.724
- Yeah, I know, no shit, she
actually does think

25:48.724 --> 25:50.965
that she's a madam, right.

25:50.965 --> 25:52.758
Anyway.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.241
We have this body that
disappeared, and then last

25:55.241 --> 25:59.172
night, we found her henchman--or
should I say woman--in a room

25:59.172 --> 26:01.896
with a dead witness, and
that's just the beginning.

26:01.896 --> 26:05.275
So I am bringing this to a judge
right now to get a warrant to go

26:05.275 --> 26:08.413
search her premises and bring
her ass in for questioning.

26:08.413 --> 26:10.034
- I will gladly sign that.

26:11.931 --> 26:14.275
- We knew we could
count on you, judge.

26:14.275 --> 26:15.551
Alright!

26:15.551 --> 26:17.068
So there you have it, okay?

26:17.068 --> 26:18.931
Let's look alive, people,
because like I said, that one

26:18.931 --> 26:21.655
right there is always--

26:21.655 --> 26:25.310
always armed and dangerous.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.448
Alright.

26:27.448 --> 26:29.758
- Hey, don't I know you?

26:29.758 --> 26:31.448
- Do you, judge?

26:31.448 --> 26:33.068
- I think I do.

26:33.068 --> 26:34.344
- I don't recall.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.448
No, ma'am.

26:36.448 --> 26:38.551
- Yeah.

26:38.551 --> 26:39.965
Okay.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.413
- Hey, guys.

26:44.413 --> 26:45.724
- Hey.

26:45.724 --> 26:47.310
- Go get a good workout in.

26:54.551 --> 26:57.689
- Hey, how was it?

26:57.689 --> 26:59.965
- Nigga, get on.

26:59.965 --> 27:01.965
- Come on, man, get that shit.

27:01.965 --> 27:03.137
- Man.

27:03.137 --> 27:04.931
I need to put
something on my joints.

27:04.931 --> 27:06.172
Fuck.

27:06.172 --> 27:08.241
- Bro, I told you to
stop using that shit.

27:08.241 --> 27:11.034
- I'm telling you, man, got the
whole club smelling like this.

27:11.034 --> 27:13.482
- Hey, fuck y'all
want me to do, man?

27:13.482 --> 27:16.275
- Shit, stop doing that.

27:16.275 --> 27:18.758
- Yeah, alright.

27:18.758 --> 27:20.137
- Nigga, where the hell Doc at?

27:20.137 --> 27:22.758
Why he always standing us up?
- Hey.

27:22.758 --> 27:24.241
Oh, he's here.

27:24.241 --> 27:25.344
- Where?

27:25.344 --> 27:26.586
- He's here.

27:26.586 --> 27:29.724
He's over there,
ain't doing shit.

27:29.724 --> 27:31.827
- I'm gonna see
what the nigga up to.

27:31.827 --> 27:33.379
- Alright, come on.

27:33.379 --> 27:34.896
Get to seven.

27:34.896 --> 27:37.517
- Nigga, you can't
bench the bar.

27:37.517 --> 27:38.862
- Yo, Doc, man, what up?

27:39.827 --> 27:41.482
- What's up, bro?
- You good?

27:41.482 --> 27:43.482
Come get this work in, bro,
you're over here just chilling.

27:43.482 --> 27:45.931
What's up?
- I'm alright, man.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.448
- Bro, it's me. What's up?

27:48.448 --> 27:50.344
- I'm alright, bro, I'm good.

27:50.344 --> 27:52.103
- Oh shit.

27:52.103 --> 27:53.517
- What?

27:53.517 --> 27:57.344
- You got that--

27:57.344 --> 27:58.931
That your baby?

27:58.931 --> 28:00.793
Man, get out of
here with that shit, man.

28:00.793 --> 28:02.965
- Bro, you got that "that's
my baby" look though.

28:02.965 --> 28:05.000
- No, man, I--
- Then what is it?

28:06.620 --> 28:07.896
- How many you got on you?

28:11.103 --> 28:12.379
- None right now.
You need some--

28:12.379 --> 28:13.379
- Look, bro.

28:13.379 --> 28:15.103
Bodies.

28:15.103 --> 28:17.068
- Bro, you know we don't
talk about that shit.

28:17.068 --> 28:18.689
- Yeah, I know.
- You mother--

28:18.689 --> 28:22.413
- My bad, bro.

28:22.413 --> 28:23.551
- You got one?

28:23.551 --> 28:26.310
- Yeah.

28:26.310 --> 28:28.517
- When?

28:32.310 --> 28:33.482
Recent.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.448
- Let me ask you this.

28:38.448 --> 28:40.517
Was it a bad person?

28:40.517 --> 28:41.551
- No.

28:41.551 --> 28:43.379
- Damn.

28:43.379 --> 28:45.586
That make it harder.

28:45.586 --> 28:46.931
Okay.

28:46.931 --> 28:49.206
But were they
trying to hurt you?

28:49.206 --> 28:50.206
- Yeah.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.068
- Okay then, there you have it.

28:52.068 --> 28:53.620
That's how we roll around here.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.137
You gotta get them
before they get us.

28:55.137 --> 28:58.103
Come on, man, don't
ponder on this too long.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.034
The longer you sit around
thinking about that shit,

29:00.034 --> 29:01.620
the longer it's gonna hold you.

29:01.620 --> 29:03.068
Come on, bro, let's
get this work.

29:03.068 --> 29:04.482
Come on.

29:14.655 --> 29:15.862
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:17.206 --> 29:19.137
- Who let you in? Who are you?

29:19.137 --> 29:20.517
- Oh, you don't remember me?

29:20.517 --> 29:22.482
I'm a friend of Amp's.

29:22.482 --> 29:23.724
- Uh, okay.

29:23.724 --> 29:25.068
Yeah, I remember you.

29:25.068 --> 29:27.344
What are you doing here?

29:27.344 --> 29:30.000
- I wouldn't cause any problem,
I'm just here to pick up shoes.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.517
- Shoes?
- Yeah, they were mine.

29:31.517 --> 29:33.275
I let Amp borrow 'em.

29:33.275 --> 29:35.137
- Okay, well, you're gonna have
to come back when he's here.

29:35.137 --> 29:37.482
He didn't tell me
anything about any shoes.

29:37.482 --> 29:39.862
- Okay. Come back.
- Mm-hmm.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.034
- Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.

29:43.586 --> 29:47.862
- Okay, well--

29:47.862 --> 29:49.758
Don't do it.

29:49.758 --> 29:51.103
- Man, you don't wanna do this.

29:51.103 --> 29:53.172
- I bet I do.
- You bet you do?

29:53.172 --> 29:56.103
- No, I need you to get
your ass out of here!

29:56.103 --> 29:58.206
- No.

29:58.206 --> 29:59.862
- You don't know who
owns this fucking club.

29:59.862 --> 30:01.275
Madam owns this club.

30:01.275 --> 30:04.275
Madam don't play--
- I don't give a fuck!

30:04.275 --> 30:05.793
- There are cameras
watching you.

30:05.793 --> 30:08.241
Is this what you wanna--
- Fuck them cameras.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.344

31:31.379 --> 31:34.758

31:39.827 --> 31:41.689
- Where's Madam?

31:41.689 --> 31:43.241
- I don't know.

31:43.241 --> 31:45.482
She wasn't here when I got here.

31:45.482 --> 31:47.724
- Wait. What?

31:47.724 --> 31:50.620
- No, she wasn't.

31:50.620 --> 31:52.689
- I'll call Madam.

31:52.689 --> 31:54.862
- Wait, Dime isn't here either?

31:54.862 --> 31:56.862

31:56.862 --> 31:58.965

32:26.379 --> 32:27.827
I'm at home.

32:27.827 --> 32:30.172
Look, I had to go
see my dad today.

32:30.172 --> 32:32.551
It's a long-ass drive, so
I'll be there in a minute.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.551
What's up?

32:33.551 --> 32:34.827

32:47.103 --> 32:50.448
-Yo, Madam,

32:50.448 --> 32:51.896
- No.

32:51.896 --> 32:53.068
- You're sure?

32:53.068 --> 32:54.655
- Yes, I'm sure.

32:54.655 --> 32:57.655
- Okay, but when's the last
time you talked to her?

32:57.655 --> 32:59.379
- Doc, chill, I got this.

33:01.586 --> 33:03.172
- Okay.

33:03.172 --> 33:04.896

33:10.758 --> 33:14.379
- Madam, I can't tonight.

Okay, I'll try.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.206
- Alright.

33:25.206 --> 33:28.206
- But you sure Blue's good?

33:28.206 --> 33:30.758
-It's Blue,

33:30.758 --> 33:31.931
-Okay.

33:45.586 --> 33:49.482
- Look, I didn't leave
nothing for y'all, so--

33:49.482 --> 33:51.689
- Now I knew we should
have let them fuck you up.

33:51.689 --> 33:54.758
- Yeah? Maybe.

33:54.758 --> 33:56.655
- Arrogant ass.

33:56.655 --> 34:00.724
- Look, nobody was here,
so I had to hold it down.

34:00.724 --> 34:02.310
- Wait.

34:02.310 --> 34:04.310
Nobody?
- Nobody.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.931
- Hey, what the
hell is going on?

34:05.931 --> 34:08.103
- I don't know.

34:08.103 --> 34:09.172
- Just introduce us.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.448
- What?

34:10.448 --> 34:12.241
- Come on.

34:12.241 --> 34:13.413
- Look, I had to do myself.

34:13.413 --> 34:15.413
Y'all can do yourself too.

34:15.413 --> 34:18.034
- You're really
doing this right now?

34:18.034 --> 34:19.793
- Fine, fine.

34:23.586 --> 34:25.896
Alright, y'all

34:36.724 --> 34:37.655
- No, I'm just kidding, y'all.

34:37.655 --> 34:41.241
Give it up for my boys!

34:44.241 --> 34:45.413
- Busta Rhymes singing
"Blow A Million Racks"]

35:38.068 --> 35:39.931
look at me in amazement

36:24.931 --> 36:26.896
-Please leave a
message at the beep.

36:26.896 --> 36:28.482
- Blue, call me.

36:41.379 --> 36:44.310
- What the fuck? Is nobody
answering their phone today?

36:44.310 --> 36:45.724
---message at
the beep.

36:45.724 --> 36:48.724
- Look, Dime, this is Madam,
okay?

36:48.724 --> 36:50.758
I don't know where
the fuck Blue is.

36:50.758 --> 36:52.655
If you see her,
tell her to call me.

36:52.655 --> 36:54.482
And you call me too.
What the fuck?

37:00.689 --> 37:03.137
- Hello? Blue?

37:03.137 --> 37:04.793
- No, it's Judge Ross.

37:04.793 --> 37:08.448
- Oh, to what do I
owe that pleasure?

37:08.448 --> 37:10.034
- No, the pleasure is all mine.

37:11.689 --> 37:13.655
-Okay.

37:13.655 --> 37:17.413
- I just want you to know
that I never forget a thing.

37:17.413 --> 37:19.758
- Great, and neither do I.

37:19.758 --> 37:22.482
- Yes, but I'm a woman
who operates

37:22.482 --> 37:25.206
within legal boundaries.

37:25.206 --> 37:27.172
- Well, judge, that's no fun.

37:27.172 --> 37:31.448
- You should try it.

37:31.448 --> 37:33.206
- Why are you calling me?

37:33.206 --> 37:35.862
-I just wanted
to hear your voice.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.413
- Why?

37:37.413 --> 37:39.931
- Well, you never know when it
might sound...

37:39.931 --> 37:42.206
quite like this again.

37:42.206 --> 37:44.206
So free.

37:44.206 --> 37:46.000
- Are you threatening me?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.517
-Oh, no, darling.

37:47.517 --> 37:49.413
It's a little too late for that.

37:50.827 --> 37:54.551
- Look, I don't know what the
fuck you think you have on me,

37:54.551 --> 37:57.068
but you might wanna
rethink that, judge.

37:57.068 --> 37:59.551
- I don't think that's even
possible at this point.

38:01.586 --> 38:03.896
- So, am I to assume that
you're not gonna tell me

38:03.896 --> 38:05.068
what it is?

38:05.068 --> 38:06.413
- No.

38:06.413 --> 38:08.241
You'll find out soon enough.

38:08.241 --> 38:09.758
- Alright.

38:09.758 --> 38:13.620
Well, until then, get
the fuck off my phone.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.103
And, bitch, don't call me again.

38:19.379 --> 38:21.724
- Who the fuck is that?

38:21.724 --> 38:22.931
Who is it?

38:22.931 --> 38:24.103
-Kat!

38:25.965 --> 38:27.068
- Come on.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.827
- They got her.
- What?

38:31.827 --> 38:34.758
- They got her at
the motel last night.

38:34.758 --> 38:36.931
- Where is she?
- She's in jail.

38:36.931 --> 38:38.172
- What?

38:38.172 --> 38:39.758
- She's in jail.

38:39.758 --> 38:42.482
- Okay, calm the fuck down.
- No, no, no, no, no.

38:42.482 --> 38:44.344
- No, what I'm gonna need you to
do is lower your tone.

38:44.344 --> 38:47.965
- No, no, no, no, you know damn
well that you killed Allen.

38:47.965 --> 38:49.793
And that Blue was there so--

38:49.793 --> 38:51.206
- Motherfucker,
what you gonna do?

38:51.206 --> 38:52.827
- I got it.
- No.

38:52.827 --> 38:55.275
- I got it.

38:55.275 --> 38:59.896
- She was only in there so that
she could clean up Doc's mess

38:59.896 --> 39:01.172
after killing that girl.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.482
Yeah.
- Kat.

39:02.482 --> 39:04.517
- I'm not playing
this shit no more.

39:04.517 --> 39:05.965
- You need to lower your tone.

39:05.965 --> 39:08.551
- I don't need to do
a fucking thing, Madam.

39:08.551 --> 39:12.275
I will give up all of
this shit, and you too.

39:12.275 --> 39:13.413
You know I'm not playing this.

39:13.413 --> 39:15.896
You got 24 hours to get her out!

39:15.896 --> 39:17.448
You hear me?

39:22.172 --> 39:23.689
- Shoot me.

39:23.689 --> 39:26.620
Isn't that your training, hmm?

39:26.620 --> 39:30.724
What the fuck they teach
you at the academy?

39:30.724 --> 39:34.689
Now, I don't know who the fuck
you think you are, coming into

39:34.689 --> 39:40.000
my house, talking to me like
a rabid-ass fucking dog.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.655
But, bitch, you obviously
don't know who the fuck I am.

39:42.655 --> 39:46.310
So we're gonna start
with an apology, okay?

39:46.310 --> 39:50.034
'Cause I am absolutely the kind
of woman that would die

39:50.034 --> 39:52.137
right the fuck here in a
shootout before I let

39:52.137 --> 39:54.965
your monkey-ass walk in my
motherfucking house

39:54.965 --> 39:56.551
talking crazy.

39:56.551 --> 39:59.241
I can't hear you, bitch!

39:59.241 --> 40:00.689
- I'm sorry.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.172
- Put your fucking gun down.

40:04.517 --> 40:06.586
Fucking crazy?

40:06.586 --> 40:08.482
What you don't realize,
bitch--did she not tell you?

40:08.482 --> 40:10.482
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy fucking crazy.

40:10.482 --> 40:11.655
This shit ain't play!

40:11.655 --> 40:15.000
Get the fuck out of my house!

40:24.586 --> 40:26.655
Auntie. Auntie.
