00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.827
Aah!

00:40.340 --> 00:43.741
Matthew, time for dinner!

00:46.880 --> 00:49.007
I'll pledge allegiance

00:49.049 --> 00:51.176
I'll pledge allegiance

00:51.217 --> 00:52.616
I'll pledge allegiance

00:52.652 --> 00:57.055
To the United States of Love ยง

00:57.090 --> 00:58.853
That was great, guys. Let's take 5.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.792
Wow! It's just like old times.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.954
This comeback is gonna be da bomb!

01:02.996 --> 01:05.260
I'm gonna get a bottle of water.
Do you dudes want any?

01:05.298 --> 01:09.894
Bring me a glass filled with
one-half Cristal, one-half Beluga caviar.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.063
I don't think we have that.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.630
Wow, Justin's really changed, dude.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.434
The yakuza!

01:19.479 --> 01:21.811
We warn you once, N'Sync!

01:21.848 --> 01:24.544
Now we warn you again... with death!

01:26.920 --> 01:28.046
Ow!

01:29.689 --> 01:32.624
Oh! Hold up! You shot me!

01:33.793 --> 01:37.285
Hey, they were out of Beluga caviar,
but they had some nice Sevruga...

01:37.330 --> 01:40.527
Oh, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:40.567 --> 01:44.333
We would not waste our bullets
on a simple roadie.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.894
Roadie?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.099
I'm in the band!

01:53.813 --> 01:55.781
Oh, my brothers!

01:55.815 --> 01:58.807
I swear I will avenge you...

01:58.852 --> 02:00.376
but how?

02:02.455 --> 02:06.323
"Yakuza invitational
martial arts tournament...

02:06.359 --> 02:07.917
one week from today!"

02:07.961 --> 02:10.657
How unlikely? But perfect.

02:13.233 --> 02:17.226
You can't enter that tournament
without the proper skills, fat one.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.238
And will you train me, Mr. Miyagi?

02:19.272 --> 02:23.106
First of all, I'm Pat-effing-Morita,
you nut sack.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.044
Second of all,
you're too old for the training.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.546
So was I...

02:27.580 --> 02:29.480
if you'll remember.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.485
Daniel-san, I thought I smelled failure.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.215
That toilet's not going to unplug itself.

02:38.725 --> 02:39.749
First lesson!

02:39.792 --> 02:41.783
Let's warm up with some stretches first.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.227
Come here, you.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.730
Unh! Ay!

02:46.099 --> 02:49.500
OK, let's set some ground rules here...
Aah!

02:51.437 --> 02:53.132
I really don't think I'm learning anything.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.300
Oh, my God! I'm on fire!

02:55.341 --> 02:57.434
Aah! Aah!

02:57.477 --> 02:58.705
Ready? Begin.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.440
- Totally awesome!
- Totally awesome!

03:00.480 --> 03:01.913
- Attack!
- Tubular!

03:01.948 --> 03:03.347
- Radical!
- Awesome!

03:03.383 --> 03:04.680
Reaganomics!

03:04.717 --> 03:06.014
There's too many of them!

03:06.052 --> 03:08.282
Trust your instincts, fat one.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.313
Only one of these turtles
is played by Corey Feldman.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.087
Trust your instincts. Corey Feldman.

03:14.127 --> 03:17.893
Trust your instincts. Corey Feldman.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.627
- Pizza is radical!
- Master Splinter is way cool!

03:20.667 --> 03:22.066
Turtle power, dude!

03:22.101 --> 03:26.367
Clean, sober, back on television...
things are lookin' up for the Feldmeister!

03:26.406 --> 03:28.533
Hyah!

03:31.444 --> 03:34.504
Daniel-san! Clean-up on aisle five.

03:35.682 --> 03:39.140
There are forty-two pressure points
on the human body which result in death.

03:39.185 --> 03:41.050
I will show you forty-one.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.555
The forty-second
I may someday need to use on you.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.114
- Hyah!
- My spleen!

03:45.158 --> 03:46.147
- Hyah!
- Oof!

03:47.727 --> 03:50.093
Now I must introduce Badtz Maru
to his god.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.994
- Farewell.
- Thanks for your help.

03:52.031 --> 03:55.432
Omm...

03:58.171 --> 03:59.536
Good luck, fat one.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.869
You won't be by my side?

04:00.907 --> 04:04.900
The true test of a warrior
is to go it alone.

04:04.944 --> 04:08.436
Besides, I got a dump brewing
that could choke a monkey.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.540
Can Joey survive the tournament?

04:10.583 --> 04:12.574
Will N'Sync be avenged?

04:12.619 --> 04:14.610
Does this look infected to you?

04:14.654 --> 04:17.714
Find out next time on <i>Enter the Fat One.</i>

04:17.757 --> 04:21.089
Ha ha ha! I'm gonna get ya!

04:21.127 --> 04:22.788
Pizza delivery!

04:22.829 --> 04:26.162
Is there any other way
I could pay for this?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.257
How convenient.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.790
Yeah!

04:28.835 --> 04:31.565
- I'll do it Hawaiian style to you, sweetie.
- Yeah!

04:31.604 --> 04:33.094
- Pool guy!
- Come in!

04:33.139 --> 04:35.004
Take my ham and cheesy goodness!

04:35.041 --> 04:37.339
Ay-ay-yi! That's good!

04:37.377 --> 04:40.869
Plumber! The door was open, so I...
Wow!

04:40.913 --> 04:43.507
- Do it! Oh, yeah!
- I'm snaking the drain!

04:43.549 --> 04:45.346
- Ooh!
- Yeah, plunge it!

04:45.385 --> 04:49.185
- We're all having sex... together!
- Yeah!

04:50.290 --> 04:53.157
But seriously,
that's $12.99 for that pizza.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.627
Damn...

04:55.662 --> 04:57.755
Jonathan is really tasty.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.699
Ay! Ay! Madre de Dios!

05:01.734 --> 05:04.567
Spelling bee at the apollo

05:04.604 --> 05:05.696
Different.

05:05.738 --> 05:10.437
D-i-f-r...

05:10.476 --> 05:11.966
Damn!

05:12.011 --> 05:14.479
- You blew it, girl!
- Aw, hell, no!

05:14.514 --> 05:17.506
Oh, no, she didn't!

05:17.550 --> 05:19.017
You wrong, girl!

05:19.052 --> 05:20.246
You steppin', girl!

05:20.286 --> 05:22.083
See ya!

05:22.121 --> 05:23.645
They're gonna love you.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.123
Big finish.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.130
What a twist!

05:42.275 --> 05:44.743
M. Night! In the pantry!

05:47.547 --> 05:49.071
Dude!

05:49.115 --> 05:52.482
Oh, my God!
I just wanted to borrow a cup of sugar!

05:52.518 --> 05:54.486
What a twist!

05:54.520 --> 05:55.953
We needed the sugar...

05:55.988 --> 05:59.549
because we're baking a cake
for a fancy party.

05:59.592 --> 06:03.585
And you're all invited,
Shyamabama family!

06:03.629 --> 06:07.087
Delightful!
Let me just change into my good suit.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.465
Oh, honey, your good suit
is at the cleaners.

06:09.502 --> 06:10.969
What a twist!

06:11.003 --> 06:14.200
Shyamamalanan family, meet our chef.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.902
I can't wait to serve you!

06:16.943 --> 06:20.344
Serve us? You mean serve us
for the main course?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.677
As in eat us?

06:24.450 --> 06:25.508
Let's dance!

06:28.688 --> 06:30.986
What a twist!

06:32.959 --> 06:34.449
Yeah, yeah. One more, one more.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.191
Who didn't use a miter joint
on this Jack-in-the-box? Ow!

06:41.701 --> 06:43.862
Ow! Why?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.894
And now, the thrilling conclusion.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.566
I'm Joey Fatone.

06:49.609 --> 06:52.772
I'm here to avenge
the death of my band mates.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.507
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here is sign-up sheet.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.809
You go fourteenth in line.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.782
Also, we gonna need a photocopy
of your driver's license.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.250
There's soda in the green room...

06:59.285 --> 07:01.617
and some broken glass
if you want to roll your hands in glue.

07:01.654 --> 07:06.853
Thanks.
I can do this. I can do this.

07:10.396 --> 07:11.658
Oh, my God!

07:11.697 --> 07:13.392
It's... it's...

07:13.433 --> 07:15.060
Hong Kong Phooey.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.466
- Number one super guy!
- Number one super guy!

07:18.271 --> 07:20.967
Hyah!

07:28.815 --> 07:30.942
Ooh! Look what I got here!

07:30.983 --> 07:33.383
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

07:33.419 --> 07:35.353
Come on. Get it, get it, get it!
Huhh!

07:37.957 --> 07:40.221
- Huh?
- Hyah!

07:48.534 --> 07:50.593
I need those. Hey, wait! Oh! Wait!

07:52.438 --> 07:55.532
Ooh! You got same tattoo!

07:55.575 --> 07:56.667
Bam!

08:03.216 --> 08:05.684
Hey, Joey! You can do it!

08:30.910 --> 08:32.138
Enough!

08:33.913 --> 08:36.938
Britney Spears?
But why would you kill N'Sync?

08:36.982 --> 08:39.543
N'Sync?
No, I killed REO Speedwagon.

08:39.585 --> 08:40.847
I... hate those guys.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.650
- Actually...
- Really?

08:42.688 --> 08:46.317
Looks like I got some unfinished
business with REO Speedwagon.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.384
- Beat it, fat one.
- You wait!

08:48.427 --> 08:49.826
- Ooh!
- What?

08:49.862 --> 08:52.490
My name is Joey Fatone.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.159
You killed my band mates.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.430
Prepare to die.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.164
Not so fast, fat one.

08:58.204 --> 09:02.368
Meet my home girls,
Christina Aguilera, Avril Lavigne...

09:02.408 --> 09:06.276
Jessica Simpson,
Jessica Simpson's sister.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.609
I'm Ashlee.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.049
Shh! The big kids are talking.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.712
- Five chicks? I think I can...
- Ha ha ha ha!

09:14.754 --> 09:18.281
Together, we're more powerful
than we ever were separately.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.384
Kind of like doing one big stadium tour
instead of a bunch of stupid mall tours.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.054
Enuck-chuk!

09:27.133 --> 09:28.225
I'm finished.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.735
- Don't worry, Joey.
- We'll help you.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.601
All for one and one for all.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.003
Reaganomics!

09:34.040 --> 09:35.302
Of course!

09:35.341 --> 09:38.276
Together,
we're stronger than we ever were solo.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.747
- Right, Justin?
- Well, uh... all right.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.909
Oh, yeah!

09:44.951 --> 09:46.282
Here we go!

09:50.957 --> 09:53.425
I'm doing my thing!

09:54.927 --> 09:56.758
Don't you tear up my heart!

09:58.764 --> 10:00.163
Aah!

10:00.199 --> 10:01.962
Unh!

10:02.001 --> 10:03.559
- Aah!
- Aah!

10:04.570 --> 10:06.868
Unh! Unh!

10:08.140 --> 10:10.131
God should have spent
a little more time on you!

10:21.153 --> 10:22.484
Unh! Aah!

10:22.521 --> 10:24.284
Ow, my boob!

10:26.692 --> 10:28.455
Yeah! All right!

10:29.662 --> 10:31.254
- Bye, bye, bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.598
I pledge allegiance

10:34.634 --> 10:37.228
To the United States

10:37.269 --> 10:39.203
Of Love

10:39.238 --> 10:42.002
Nicely done, fat one.

10:42.041 --> 10:47.308
Now your mind and body
truly "in sync."

10:51.417 --> 10:54.443
That's how y'all endin' the show?
That joke sucked!

10:54.487 --> 10:56.478
This whole episode... sucked, y'all!

10:56.522 --> 10:59.252
Now, I'm gonna kill Joey!
How do I get out of here?

10:59.291 --> 11:01.088
Man, it's hot in this box!

11:01.127 --> 11:03.891
Oh, I hate you, Joey Fatone!

11:18.377 --> 11:20.641
- Ba-gawk!
- Bock.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.308
Only one of these turtles
is played by Forcory...

11:23.349 --> 11:24.941
for Fory Clel...

11:24.984 --> 11:27.316
Clory Flu... Cloris Leachman.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.624
Stupid monkey.
