00:00.605 --> 00:01.687
<i>Previously, on</i> Cedar Cove--

00:01.689 --> 00:03.355
Roy told me everything
that John did.

00:03.657 --> 00:05.373
He wants me
to move to New York.

00:05.375 --> 00:06.825
I'm the new D.A.

00:06.827 --> 00:08.460
I want you to let me do
what I do best, Dad,

00:08.462 --> 00:09.294
and that is run this
business.

00:09.296 --> 00:10.595
You mean <i> my</i> business.

00:10.597 --> 00:12.597
I'm your new
Chief Financial Officer.

00:12.599 --> 00:14.799
I want us
to move in together.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.173
Mom.

00:22.175 --> 00:24.943
Maryellen!

00:24.945 --> 00:26.194
What are you doing?

00:26.196 --> 00:28.346
You weren't supposed to
be here until tomorrow!

00:28.348 --> 00:30.782
Oh! I caught
an earlier flight.

00:30.784 --> 00:32.250
Well, where is John?

00:32.252 --> 00:33.852
He'll be here
in a couple of days.

00:33.854 --> 00:37.155
He had to fill in
for a sick sous chef, so.

00:38.292 --> 00:40.408
Oh! It's so good
to be home.

00:41.762 --> 00:43.144
What?

00:43.146 --> 00:44.362
Okay. Spill it.

00:44.364 --> 00:45.530
Spill what?

00:45.532 --> 00:46.498
What's wrong?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.900
Mom.

00:48.902 --> 00:50.652
I'm just here for a visit.

00:51.872 --> 00:54.973
I missed you
and I had the time off.

00:54.975 --> 00:56.041
Swear.

00:56.043 --> 00:57.309
Really?

00:57.311 --> 00:59.811
I just miss you, Mom.

01:00.948 --> 01:03.515
Oh. I miss you, too.

01:07.621 --> 01:10.188
Peggy and Moon
really outdid themselves.

01:10.190 --> 01:12.657
Mm, yeah,
I loved the lobster.

01:14.895 --> 01:17.028
So, how much
more small-talk

01:17.030 --> 01:18.030
do we have to do

01:18.031 --> 01:19.331
before we talk about

01:19.333 --> 01:21.900
what you clearly don't
want to talk about?

01:21.902 --> 01:24.369
You're right.

01:24.371 --> 01:25.503
Moving in together,

01:25.505 --> 01:28.340
it is the next step for us.

01:28.342 --> 01:30.909
I think we need to boldly go

01:30.911 --> 01:32.544
where neither one
of us have gone

01:32.546 --> 01:34.896
since we got divorced--

01:34.898 --> 01:37.248
living with someone
that we love,

01:37.250 --> 01:39.267
and I do love you.

01:39.269 --> 01:41.619
Love is not the issue.

01:41.621 --> 01:43.655
Dating is supposed to
lead to something,

01:43.657 --> 01:44.956
or away from something.

01:44.958 --> 01:47.208
It's a big decision.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.827
And I'm committed to you

01:48.829 --> 01:51.496
and to making
what we have work.

01:51.498 --> 01:52.964
Okay.

01:52.966 --> 01:55.400
All right. How about...

01:55.402 --> 01:56.868
you sleep on it

01:56.870 --> 01:58.837
and then we'll have
dinner tomorrow night

01:58.839 --> 02:01.406
and we'll talk
about it some more?

02:01.408 --> 02:03.742
I can commit to that.

02:03.744 --> 02:05.777
Okay.

02:13.887 --> 02:15.453
[door shuts]

02:19.926 --> 02:22.110
[phone rings]

02:22.996 --> 02:24.629
[sighs heavily]

02:24.631 --> 02:25.897
Hey, Jeri.

02:25.899 --> 02:27.999
I need you in Seattle
tomorrow for notes.

02:28.001 --> 02:29.701
Why don't you just
send me your notes?

02:29.703 --> 02:30.902
<i>Look, Jack.</i>

02:30.904 --> 02:32.670
<i>This is a new
relationship for us--</i>

02:32.672 --> 02:35.106
editor/writer, boss/employee.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.308
<i>I just want to make sure</i>

02:37.310 --> 02:39.344
nothing's lost in
translation.

02:39.346 --> 02:41.046
All right. [sighs]

02:41.048 --> 02:43.515
I'll be on the morning ferry,

02:43.517 --> 02:45.200
<i>but I need to be
back here for dinner.</i>

02:45.202 --> 02:46.384
Short leash.

02:46.386 --> 02:49.821
Not a leash. Love.

02:49.823 --> 02:52.090
A foreign concept to you,
I know, Jeri.

02:52.092 --> 02:54.392
Funny.

03:27.494 --> 03:29.661
Good morning, Judge Lockhart.

03:29.663 --> 03:30.895
Mr. District Attorney.

03:30.897 --> 03:31.930
Oh! A gentleman.

03:31.932 --> 03:33.898
I try.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.216
That is a big stack of files.

03:35.218 --> 03:36.868
Yeah. Night court.
Care to help out?

03:36.870 --> 03:38.853
I did my stint
two months ago.

03:38.855 --> 03:40.105
Oddly enough,
that's the last time

03:40.107 --> 03:42.040
my predecessor
held night court.

03:42.042 --> 03:43.408
These are all
the current cases,

03:43.410 --> 03:45.143
and two months
of back-logged cases,

03:45.145 --> 03:47.128
from every small town
surrounding Cedar Cove

03:47.130 --> 03:48.646
that doesn't have a court.

03:48.648 --> 03:49.848
Yikes!

03:49.850 --> 03:50.648
Is that
a legal term? "Yikes."

03:50.650 --> 03:52.200
"Yikes versus Yikes,

03:52.202 --> 03:53.218
the case about the D.A.

03:53.220 --> 03:54.719
who was buried alive
by his own workload.

03:54.721 --> 03:56.721
Oh, it's possible.
Last chance?

03:56.723 --> 03:58.123
Oh, I don't want to
deprive the other judges

03:58.125 --> 03:59.657
of the joys of night court.

03:59.659 --> 04:02.060
Ah. You're a giver.

04:02.062 --> 04:04.229
To a fault!

04:04.231 --> 04:08.166
So, uh, where's your father
this morning?

04:08.168 --> 04:10.668
I actually have
no idea where Buck is.

04:10.670 --> 04:14.172
I kinda like him.
Seems like a nice fella.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.774
So, uh... heh.

04:16.776 --> 04:18.276
I'm guessing, then,

04:18.278 --> 04:20.278
that you were raised
by your mother?

04:20.279 --> 04:22.063
Actually, Moon, no,

04:22.065 --> 04:23.681
I was raised by
nannies and housekeepers

04:23.683 --> 04:25.884
before they sent me
off to a boarding school.

04:25.886 --> 04:27.285
Can I get my credit card
back?

04:27.287 --> 04:29.921
Actually, uh, no,
this card's been canceled.

04:29.923 --> 04:31.339
Right, well,
that's obviously a mistake.

04:31.341 --> 04:32.323
Try it again.

04:32.325 --> 04:35.393
No, I already ran it twice.

04:35.395 --> 04:37.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you--

04:40.083 --> 04:42.467
Can I have my card back,
please?

04:45.405 --> 04:47.172
I'm sorry.

04:47.174 --> 04:49.207
Yeah, I'm sure you're sorry.

04:49.209 --> 04:53.709
Well, truth be told,
I did kind of enjoy that.

04:53.914 --> 04:56.097
Really?

04:57.717 --> 04:59.784
[chuckles]

05:14.568 --> 05:15.700
Ah. Hey.

05:15.702 --> 05:16.801
Hey.

05:16.803 --> 05:18.369
- Nice haul.
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

05:18.371 --> 05:21.239
So, uh, start with the bilge.
It's clogged.

05:21.241 --> 05:22.173
You're gonna have to
drain it by hand,

05:22.175 --> 05:23.575
then hit the filters.

05:23.577 --> 05:25.310
See, the way it works is,
the guys and I fish,

05:25.312 --> 05:26.644
and you keep
the equipment running.

05:26.646 --> 05:28.246
Pay's at the end of week.

05:28.248 --> 05:30.014
Anything you break, you pay for.
Can you handle that?

05:30.016 --> 05:31.382
Yeah. Copy that.

05:31.384 --> 05:32.984
Bilge. On it.

05:32.986 --> 05:34.586
Right on.

05:36.189 --> 05:39.073
You brought me here for this?

05:39.075 --> 05:41.659
Look. This is a phone call
and a scan.

05:41.661 --> 05:43.194
Okay.

05:43.196 --> 05:44.862
I didn't call you here

05:44.864 --> 05:46.381
to do notes on your story.

05:46.383 --> 05:47.398
[sighs] Jeri--

05:47.400 --> 05:48.766
I called you

05:48.768 --> 05:52.036
to do notes on
everyone else's story.

05:56.509 --> 05:58.209
But you are also
a very good editor,

05:58.211 --> 06:00.144
which is why
I am promoting you

06:00.146 --> 06:02.580
to assistant editor.

06:02.582 --> 06:04.599
What?

06:04.601 --> 06:06.217
I can name whomever I want,

06:06.219 --> 06:08.052
and I want you.

06:10.190 --> 06:13.625
Professionally speaking,
of course.

06:13.627 --> 06:14.959
So I guess the question is,

06:14.961 --> 06:17.629
do you want it?

06:17.631 --> 06:20.431
The job, not me.

06:21.318 --> 06:23.901
Yes. Absolutely.

06:23.903 --> 06:25.436
All right, then stop talking,

06:25.438 --> 06:27.121
and get to work.

06:27.123 --> 06:29.190
Now?

06:29.192 --> 06:30.541
If you want the job.

06:30.543 --> 06:32.677
Do want to go see
your new office?

06:33.563 --> 06:35.663
Lead the way.

06:40.954 --> 06:42.587
Ahem!

06:44.224 --> 06:45.356
Grace!

06:45.358 --> 06:46.891
You like?

06:46.893 --> 06:48.626
I love!

06:48.628 --> 06:49.827
Yeah, me too.

06:49.829 --> 06:51.696
- How?
- Magic.

06:51.698 --> 06:53.481
Cost me an arm and leg
at the salon,

06:53.483 --> 06:54.565
but totally worth it.

06:54.567 --> 06:56.501
Well, new hair, new job?

06:56.503 --> 06:57.769
Yeah.

06:57.771 --> 06:59.871
Congratulations, by the way.

06:59.873 --> 07:01.673
On being Town Manager
or the hair?

07:01.675 --> 07:03.574
Both, unless
you decide to put on

07:03.576 --> 07:05.610
that engagement ring
Cliff gave you.

07:05.612 --> 07:07.178
No, it's still here.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.646
And thanks.

07:08.648 --> 07:11.165
My Town Manager news
does not hold a candle

07:11.167 --> 07:13.217
to you and Jack
moving in together.

07:13.219 --> 07:15.486
You gonna do it?

07:15.488 --> 07:16.704
[Olivia sighs heavily]

07:16.706 --> 07:18.723
I love him,

07:18.725 --> 07:20.908
but sharing space
with someone...

07:20.910 --> 07:22.126
Well, I know you love him.

07:22.128 --> 07:23.628
I mean, I love him!

07:23.630 --> 07:24.996
But do you trust him?

07:24.998 --> 07:26.197
Can you trust him?

07:29.803 --> 07:33.237
I saw Maryellen at Moon's.

07:33.239 --> 07:36.541
Out of the blue,
she just shows up, no John.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.309
She's being evasive.

07:38.311 --> 07:39.711
Something's up.

07:39.713 --> 07:42.113
You don't just fly across
the country on a whim.

07:42.115 --> 07:43.881
If you love your mother,
you do.

07:43.883 --> 07:45.283
She's acting like she did

07:45.285 --> 07:47.151
when she broke that antique
glass vase of mine.

07:47.153 --> 07:49.354
Completely
and utterly guilty.

07:49.356 --> 07:50.621
She was eight.

07:50.623 --> 07:51.656
Guilt is guilt!

07:51.658 --> 07:53.391
[chuckles]

08:07.340 --> 08:10.341
[♪♪]

08:15.915 --> 08:18.116
I didn't even recognize you
at first.

08:18.118 --> 08:20.685
You look so...

08:20.687 --> 08:21.687
date-y.

08:21.688 --> 08:23.087
[laughs]

08:23.089 --> 08:24.255
You and Jack?

08:24.257 --> 08:26.257
Uh-huh. And you?

08:26.259 --> 08:28.526
Ah, I just have my work to
keep me company, I'm afraid.

08:28.528 --> 08:30.094
What would it take

08:30.096 --> 08:31.996
for you to let me
pick your brain

08:31.998 --> 08:33.030
about a case?

08:33.032 --> 08:34.599
Not a pending case.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.601
An old case.
I'm tracking precedent.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.836
You're trying to get me
to do night court.

08:38.837 --> 08:40.104
Am I?

08:40.106 --> 08:42.306
Yes! You're gonna
sit down,

08:42.308 --> 08:45.610
ask me a question that you
know I know the answer to,

08:45.612 --> 08:48.146
declare me brilliant,

08:48.148 --> 08:50.214
and then bring up night
court.

08:50.216 --> 08:52.517
I was also gonna
buy you a bottle of wine.

08:52.519 --> 08:55.253
I have very expensive taste.

08:55.255 --> 08:59.073
I would be disappointed...
if you didn't.

09:01.494 --> 09:04.562
Hey, I got your message.
What's up?

09:06.116 --> 09:08.900
There's a problem
with your application.

09:08.902 --> 09:11.469
The owner of the house saw
that you don't have a job.

09:11.471 --> 09:13.471
And he won't accept you
unless you have a job

09:13.473 --> 09:14.906
and first and last
month's rent.

09:14.908 --> 09:16.707
We can hold him off
for a day or two, but...

09:16.709 --> 09:18.109
I thought I'd have more time.

09:18.111 --> 09:19.060
You don't.

09:19.062 --> 09:20.062
Sorry.

09:20.063 --> 09:21.078
Don't be.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.413
I'll get it worked out.

09:22.415 --> 09:23.981
I'll have a job
and the money.

09:23.983 --> 09:25.399
Just don't rent the room out.

09:27.921 --> 09:29.420
What are you looking at?

09:29.422 --> 09:30.438
Oh, no.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.023
What?

09:32.025 --> 09:33.691
It's "Dr. Chad."

09:33.693 --> 09:34.693
He's so great.

09:34.694 --> 09:37.995
So you've told me,
over and over again.

09:37.997 --> 09:39.664
Who's Dr. Chad?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.449
It's her boss,
Dr. Chad.

09:41.451 --> 09:44.051
I've limited her to an hour
of "Chad" talk a day.

09:44.053 --> 09:46.571
It's about 59 minutes
more than I can stand.

09:46.573 --> 09:48.606
- I'm in love.
- With being in love!

09:48.608 --> 09:49.807
Just do it!

09:49.809 --> 09:50.775
No.

09:50.777 --> 09:52.109
[Rebecca]: Then I'll do it.

09:52.111 --> 09:55.213
Someone's got to put me
out of my misery.

09:55.215 --> 09:56.614
Let me ask you something.

09:56.616 --> 09:58.683
Would you ever ask a guy out?

09:58.685 --> 10:02.286
Uh, well, no, but that's
just not my style.

10:02.288 --> 10:03.821
Thank you!

10:03.823 --> 10:05.056
See?

10:05.058 --> 10:06.140
See what?

10:06.142 --> 10:07.892
That you both have
antiquated views on dating?

10:07.894 --> 10:09.427
I don't know what to do.

10:09.429 --> 10:10.895
[Rebecca]:
Listen up, Jane Austen.

10:10.897 --> 10:12.063
It's simple.

10:12.065 --> 10:14.365
Ask him out before
somebody else does.

10:14.367 --> 10:15.833
I can't.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.318
It's against
the laws of nature.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.903
A squirrel
who can water-ski

10:18.905 --> 10:20.121
goes against
the laws of nature,

10:20.123 --> 10:21.339
not this.

10:21.341 --> 10:23.307
Is it wrong
that I love that video?

10:23.309 --> 10:24.408
Me too.

10:24.410 --> 10:25.576
What if he says no?

10:25.578 --> 10:26.794
What if he says yes?

10:26.796 --> 10:28.679
Ugh...

10:28.681 --> 10:30.047
What?

10:30.049 --> 10:32.567
Another perky roommate?

10:34.487 --> 10:36.120
Are you coming, Justine?

10:36.122 --> 10:38.389
I'll call you later.

10:40.226 --> 10:41.626
Hey!

10:42.829 --> 10:43.878
What's up?

10:43.880 --> 10:46.163
I need a job, now,

10:46.165 --> 10:47.665
so that I can move out,
like I wanted to.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.833
Well, I could lend you
the money.

10:48.835 --> 10:50.218
What would my mom say
about that?

10:50.220 --> 10:52.203
Not her decision.

10:52.205 --> 10:53.554
Sweet of you, Uncle Will,

10:53.556 --> 10:55.823
but I need a job,
not just money.

11:02.715 --> 11:05.583
So, how is
Rebecca's probation going?

11:05.585 --> 11:07.251
She's fighting me
on everything.

11:07.253 --> 11:08.786
She is a fighter.

11:08.788 --> 11:10.988
Yeah, but if you fight
everyone and everything,

11:10.990 --> 11:13.090
you just burn out.

11:13.092 --> 11:15.293
You have a plan
to school Miss Jennings?

11:15.295 --> 11:17.495
I always have a plan.

11:17.497 --> 11:18.512
Which is?

11:18.514 --> 11:19.897
You're curious?

11:19.899 --> 11:20.965
Interested.

11:20.967 --> 11:22.333
I can see.

11:22.335 --> 11:24.502
You only see
what I want you to see.

11:25.405 --> 11:27.889
You know what I see?

11:29.275 --> 11:30.508
Jack.

11:30.510 --> 11:31.542
Hi.

11:31.544 --> 11:33.811
Hi.

11:42.510 --> 11:44.510
Okay. Um...

11:44.512 --> 11:45.778
I've got a lot of work to do.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.580
Uh...

11:47.582 --> 11:50.066
I'll see you in court.

11:50.068 --> 11:52.402
- Paul.
- Jack.

11:59.878 --> 12:03.379
I was feeling bad about being
late for our dinner date,

12:03.381 --> 12:05.765
but it seems
you had the date,

12:05.767 --> 12:06.999
just not with me.

12:07.001 --> 12:08.668
You left me
sitting here alone.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.970
A colleague kept me company.

12:10.972 --> 12:12.705
The ferry
had mechanical problems.

12:12.707 --> 12:13.673
I called.

12:13.675 --> 12:14.640
Jack.

12:14.642 --> 12:15.975
Olivia.

12:15.977 --> 12:17.977
I called and I texted.

12:17.979 --> 12:20.279
The ferry
that you chose to take,

12:20.281 --> 12:22.215
the last ferry of the night.

12:22.217 --> 12:23.483
I couldn't leave earlier,

12:23.485 --> 12:25.435
because...

12:25.437 --> 12:28.521
Jeri gave me a big promotion.

12:28.523 --> 12:31.157
Assistant Editor.

12:31.159 --> 12:32.842
It means I'll have
a lot of editorial control

12:32.844 --> 12:34.060
over what's written,

12:34.062 --> 12:36.028
and I get a big pay raise.

12:36.030 --> 12:38.064
That's a lot for you
to take on right now,

12:38.066 --> 12:39.732
don't you think?

12:39.734 --> 12:41.367
No.

12:46.207 --> 12:49.609
I've got court
early in the morning.

12:49.611 --> 12:52.445
Ah. Right.

12:53.615 --> 12:55.348
Make it a raincheck, then?

12:55.350 --> 12:57.350
Definitely.

12:59.287 --> 13:00.686
Okay.

13:07.762 --> 13:09.996
[Justine]: How was your
first day at work?

13:09.998 --> 13:12.115
Oh, it's great to be
back on the water again.

13:12.117 --> 13:14.000
Or at least near it.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.052
Although...

13:16.054 --> 13:18.070
Derek doesn't have
any intention in taking me

13:18.072 --> 13:19.705
out on the boat anytime soon.

13:19.707 --> 13:21.124
Got to earn my place.

13:21.126 --> 13:22.608
It's like the Navy.

13:22.610 --> 13:24.277
It is?

13:24.279 --> 13:25.678
Uh, yeah.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.946
You know, you can't
walk up and say,

13:26.948 --> 13:29.081
"Hey, I want to be
a S.E.A.L."

13:29.083 --> 13:30.683
You got to go through
the process,

13:30.685 --> 13:31.984
earn your place.

13:31.986 --> 13:33.436
Still.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.487
Still what?

13:34.489 --> 13:36.622
Maybe Derek
isn't getting over

13:36.624 --> 13:38.724
the fact that Seth
isn't coming back.

13:38.726 --> 13:40.443
Working on the <i> Sarah Jae</i>

13:40.445 --> 13:41.444
isn't the only job out there.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.262
I like the work.

13:43.264 --> 13:44.897
I want it to work out.

13:44.899 --> 13:47.567
I don't really mesh
with the suit-and-tie jobs,

13:47.569 --> 13:50.169
if you know what I mean.

13:51.139 --> 13:53.506
You mesh with me.

13:56.277 --> 14:00.546
I think you're done
your job search for tonight.

14:02.984 --> 14:05.418
[♪♪]

14:10.325 --> 14:11.541
[keys jangle onto counter]

14:11.543 --> 14:14.944
Don't mind me,
I'm just passing through.

14:16.431 --> 14:18.798
I really need to find a job.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.333
Yeah.

14:20.335 --> 14:22.435
[laughs]

14:26.641 --> 14:29.942
[saw whirs]

14:31.546 --> 14:32.678
Say when.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.448
That's coffee with real
cream,

14:35.450 --> 14:38.851
and you're not bugging me
about my cholesterol.

14:38.853 --> 14:40.186
Cookies.

14:40.188 --> 14:42.088
And I've seen that look
before.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.290
These cookies are not free.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.225
And now the smile.

14:46.227 --> 14:48.794
Well, I've been thinking

14:48.796 --> 14:51.764
that maybe I'd just start
a catering business.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.032
I have the time,

14:53.034 --> 14:54.800
and I know I could
get business in town

14:54.802 --> 14:56.168
and even here,

14:56.170 --> 14:58.154
we could advertise
full-service weddings--

14:58.156 --> 15:00.423
No. No. No cookies,
no coffee with real cream,

15:00.425 --> 15:01.874
and no catering business.

15:01.876 --> 15:03.509
Why?

15:03.511 --> 15:06.012
I've shucked
my last oyster, Peggy.

15:06.014 --> 15:08.014
Oh! But you don't have to do
anything, I'll do it all.

15:08.016 --> 15:09.615
You already do too much!

15:10.952 --> 15:12.752
I'm thinking of you.

15:16.090 --> 15:18.190
[saw whirring]

15:21.663 --> 15:24.180
[footsteps]

15:25.466 --> 15:27.199
You did this?

15:27.201 --> 15:28.834
[shuts door]

15:28.836 --> 15:30.720
Buck had me cancel your
cards.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.104
And you did it?

15:32.106 --> 15:33.806
He's my <i> boss.</i>

15:33.808 --> 15:35.041
And yours, too.

15:35.043 --> 15:36.242
- Fine, then reissue it.
- I can't.

15:36.244 --> 15:37.293
No, I can't, Alex,

15:37.295 --> 15:38.678
because you changed
the password

15:38.680 --> 15:40.613
on the main account.
But hey, guess what?

15:40.615 --> 15:41.998
You're the C.F.O.,
so you can reissue it,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.050
now reissue it. Now.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.690
Oh. Okay. I see.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.892
All right. Well, that's fine.
I'll just get up in the morning,

15:52.894 --> 15:55.094
go to the bank, and pull out
as much cash as I need.

15:55.096 --> 15:56.162
But unlike you...

15:56.164 --> 15:58.130
I generate business here.

15:58.132 --> 16:00.266
[card clatters]

16:00.268 --> 16:02.101
- Warren!
- We're done talking.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.306
[door slams]

16:11.813 --> 16:13.429
What's going on, hon?

16:13.431 --> 16:14.880
<i>Mom is so suspicious, John.</i>

16:14.882 --> 16:15.848
Really?

16:15.850 --> 16:16.799
Yeah.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.517
<i>How can you tell?</i>

16:18.519 --> 16:19.685
She's asking a lot of
questions about you and me.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.120
<i>- Tell her.</i>
<i>- </i> No.

16:21.122 --> 16:22.755
It's okay.

16:22.757 --> 16:23.856
<i>No.</i>

16:23.858 --> 16:25.308
This is our baby.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.742
We're going to
tell her together,

16:26.744 --> 16:28.828
like we planned.

16:35.169 --> 16:37.486
Oh, hey!
You got my message.

16:37.488 --> 16:38.621
Yeah.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.122
Yeah, I tried to get her
started this morning,

16:40.124 --> 16:41.240
but she wouldn't.

16:41.242 --> 16:43.209
Got a couple guys coming
to take a look at it.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.945
[starter buzzes,
engine roars]

16:47.181 --> 16:48.814
[laughing]
How did you do that?

16:48.816 --> 16:50.082
Ah, just had some air
in the fuel line.

16:50.084 --> 16:51.384
I flushed it.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.985
Yeah, well,
with a boat like this,

16:52.987 --> 16:54.353
there's a trick to getting
all the air out--

16:54.355 --> 16:55.888
you gotta tip the line
forward.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.923
Huh. I didn't
even ask you to.

16:57.925 --> 17:01.060
Yeah, well, you hired me
to keep this boat running,

17:01.062 --> 17:02.728
so, that's what I did--

17:02.730 --> 17:03.763
I got it running.

17:03.765 --> 17:04.763
Thought today was
gonna be a total loss,

17:04.766 --> 17:05.998
but I guess not.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.032
I can take the boat out.

17:07.035 --> 17:08.968
But I sent my whole crew
home.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.703
You wanna come?

17:10.704 --> 17:12.605
Yeah.

17:12.607 --> 17:15.273
Close it up.
Let's go.

17:17.712 --> 17:18.644
Where have you been?

17:18.646 --> 17:21.012
I went to the store.

17:21.015 --> 17:23.214
Well, what about breakfast?

17:23.217 --> 17:25.634
I had mine
already. Thanks.

17:26.570 --> 17:28.821
Well, you always
make me breakfast.

17:28.823 --> 17:31.424
Yeah, well, I was thinking
about what you said.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.225
What did I say?

17:33.227 --> 17:34.894
I do too much.

17:34.896 --> 17:36.228
Did I say that?

17:36.230 --> 17:39.632
Yep! You did.
And you're right.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.467
Well, maybe I was wrong.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.019
No, Bob, you're right.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.621
So, from now on,

17:45.623 --> 17:47.940
you're gonna make
your own breakfast.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.409
I'm just thinking
of you, honey.

17:56.084 --> 17:58.551
Did you get all my motions?

17:58.553 --> 18:00.653
I did.

18:00.655 --> 18:03.089
For every case
you've ever done

18:03.091 --> 18:04.824
since you started here.

18:04.826 --> 18:05.991
That was a lot of paperwork.

18:05.993 --> 18:07.176
It is.

18:07.178 --> 18:08.894
You wanted to sign off
on all my motions,

18:08.896 --> 18:10.262
and I wanted to be thorough,

18:10.264 --> 18:11.797
make sure
you saw all of them.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.899
You were thorough
to a fault--

18:13.901 --> 18:15.551
motions to produce discovery,

18:15.553 --> 18:16.769
motions to endorse
additional witnesses,

18:16.771 --> 18:17.771
motions to compel,

18:17.772 --> 18:18.904
motions in limine.

18:18.906 --> 18:21.006
Well, I didn't
want to miss anything.

18:21.008 --> 18:23.225
You wanted

18:23.227 --> 18:24.660
to teach me a lesson.

18:24.662 --> 18:25.644
Me?

18:25.646 --> 18:27.513
You have many, many skills,

18:27.515 --> 18:30.316
but feigning innocence
is not one of them.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.383
You wanted to make a point,

18:31.385 --> 18:32.718
and so you buried me
in paperwork,

18:32.720 --> 18:35.888
because you thought
I was burying you.

18:35.890 --> 18:38.457
You have an interesting take
on "probation."

18:38.459 --> 18:41.127
Would you like to see
tomorrow's motions?

18:41.129 --> 18:42.945
That's not necessary.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.297
But I would like to see

18:45.299 --> 18:46.966
your recommendations.

18:47.819 --> 18:49.702
My recommendations?

18:49.704 --> 18:51.804
Yeah, your reviews
of the cases, the estimates,

18:51.806 --> 18:53.272
what plea offers
you were gonna make,

18:53.274 --> 18:55.424
whether or not the case is
strong enough to stand trial,

18:55.426 --> 18:57.109
the credibility
of the witnesses,

18:57.111 --> 18:59.211
and what sentence a jury
is likely to hand out.

18:59.213 --> 19:00.279
You know...

19:00.281 --> 19:02.515
your recommendations.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.250
For current cases?

19:04.252 --> 19:05.785
Let's go back six months.

19:05.787 --> 19:08.454
That's 30 or 40 cases!

19:08.456 --> 19:10.089
Oh, you're very thorough.

19:10.091 --> 19:11.090
- You can handle it.
- Really?

19:11.092 --> 19:12.992
You seem to have
a flare for paperwork

19:12.994 --> 19:15.027
and I like to make sure
that the people in my office

19:15.029 --> 19:17.480
get the opportunity
to do what they love.

19:17.482 --> 19:19.098
I love being in court.

19:19.100 --> 19:21.066
And once you finish
this assignment,

19:21.068 --> 19:22.685
I promise...

19:22.687 --> 19:25.104
I will send you
back to court.

19:30.595 --> 19:31.894
[knocks]

19:33.481 --> 19:35.748
Grace. What is it?

19:35.750 --> 19:38.017
I'm going to be a Grandma!

19:38.886 --> 19:39.869
[gasps]

19:39.871 --> 19:41.220
[laughs]

19:44.346 --> 19:45.411
Pregnant?

19:45.413 --> 19:46.946
That is wonderful news.

19:46.948 --> 19:48.481
Yes.

19:48.483 --> 19:49.649
Well, when did she tell you?

19:49.651 --> 19:50.717
Oh, she hasn't.

19:50.719 --> 19:51.918
Excuse me?

19:51.920 --> 19:53.219
She's gonna wait
until John gets here

19:53.221 --> 19:54.354
and then they're gonna
tell me together.

19:54.356 --> 19:55.421
So how do you know?

19:55.423 --> 19:57.090
I overheard her on the phone.

19:57.092 --> 19:58.925
You listened in
on her phone call?

19:58.927 --> 20:00.226
Yes, I did,
and it wasn't easy.

20:00.228 --> 20:01.961
She's always been
so soft-spoken.

20:01.963 --> 20:03.279
You heard half
of a conversation.

20:03.281 --> 20:04.530
So?

20:04.532 --> 20:05.765
It may not be
what you think it is.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.800
She said "baby" --

20:07.802 --> 20:08.802
"our baby" --

20:08.803 --> 20:10.069
on the phone.

20:10.071 --> 20:11.671
She's definitely pregnant.

20:11.673 --> 20:13.906
Well, you should
tell her you know.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.842
That'll ruin the surprise!

20:15.844 --> 20:17.710
But there isn't a surprise.
You know.

20:17.712 --> 20:19.646
Well, they don't know
that I know!

20:19.648 --> 20:22.649
Oh, Grace.
You cannot keep a secret.

20:22.651 --> 20:24.117
Not since Fourth Grade.

20:24.119 --> 20:25.119
I will.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.269
Swear.

20:27.355 --> 20:28.871
I should tell Cliff.

20:28.873 --> 20:32.058
'Cause he's, you know,
he's gonna be a grandpa.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.159
[laughs]

20:33.161 --> 20:35.094
If I marry him.

20:35.096 --> 20:37.280
[laughing harder]

20:41.036 --> 20:42.568
This seat taken?

20:42.570 --> 20:44.654
Hi, Uncle Will.

20:44.656 --> 20:47.140
How's the job search going?

20:47.142 --> 20:49.642
It's kind of come
and gone for today.

20:49.644 --> 20:51.944
I got offered a great job
at the crisis center,

20:51.946 --> 20:53.112
which pays well,

20:53.114 --> 20:55.515
but doesn't really work
with going to school.

20:55.517 --> 20:58.318
And Moon offered me
my old job back,

20:58.320 --> 20:59.686
which would work
around school,

20:59.688 --> 21:00.837
but doesn't pay enough for
me to move out on my own.

21:00.839 --> 21:03.356
Come on...
let me help.

21:03.358 --> 21:05.258
We can call it a loan.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.459
Borrowing money
from relatives

21:06.461 --> 21:08.027
is a bad idea.

21:08.029 --> 21:10.930
That sounds like
Olivia, not you.

21:10.932 --> 21:13.316
Your mother never
needed anybody's help,

21:13.318 --> 21:14.984
which is why
she doesn't understand.

21:14.986 --> 21:16.402
But that's not the reason why

21:16.404 --> 21:17.537
she doesn't want you
to take my money.

21:17.539 --> 21:20.106
Olivia likes
to control things

21:20.108 --> 21:22.642
and if you move out,
there's less control.

21:22.644 --> 21:25.078
Mom's not like that.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.512
[laughs grandly]

21:26.514 --> 21:27.647
I've known her longer.

21:27.649 --> 21:29.115
She is.

21:29.117 --> 21:31.951
She can be quite a force
when she wants to be.

21:31.953 --> 21:33.770
She can be a force even when
she doesn't want to be.

21:33.772 --> 21:36.673
But don't let her lack
of support stop you.

21:36.675 --> 21:38.524
Mom supports me.

21:39.527 --> 21:41.294
She doesn't.

21:49.537 --> 21:51.204
It's password protected.

21:51.206 --> 21:53.056
If you want to see something,

21:53.058 --> 21:54.540
just ask.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.609
Yeah, I do, actually. I want
to see all the access codes

21:56.611 --> 21:58.227
to all of Saget Company's
bank accounts.

21:58.229 --> 21:59.979
Look, Alex, I can't
get any cash here.

21:59.981 --> 22:01.614
I'm locked out.

22:01.616 --> 22:02.849
Your father asked me not
to--

22:02.851 --> 22:04.100
[scoffs]
My father? Yes--

22:04.102 --> 22:05.251
That's a--
that's a good one.

22:05.253 --> 22:06.552
I have no credit.

22:06.554 --> 22:07.637
I have no signing ability
for checks,

22:07.639 --> 22:09.355
revoked power-of-attorney.

22:09.357 --> 22:10.456
You know, it feels like it's my
16th birthday all over again,

22:10.458 --> 22:11.791
only so much more fun.

22:11.793 --> 22:12.992
Okay, whatever's going on
between you and Buck--

22:12.994 --> 22:15.528
What's going on
between Buck and me is you.

22:16.364 --> 22:18.331
You!

Open water, boat,
it's heaven.

22:47.495 --> 22:48.895
You must have liked the Navy.

22:48.897 --> 22:50.663
No.

22:50.665 --> 22:51.697
I loved the Navy.

22:51.699 --> 22:54.484
I loved what I did.

22:54.486 --> 22:55.802
So do you miss it?

22:55.804 --> 22:58.337
Yeah, I'd be lying if I said
I didn't miss the Navy.

22:58.339 --> 22:59.605
It's all I've ever known.

22:59.607 --> 23:02.975
Hey, no offense
to me or my business,

23:02.977 --> 23:04.861
but couldn't you do better
than working for me?

23:04.863 --> 23:07.046
Didn't finish high school.

23:07.048 --> 23:08.931
You know,
to be honest with you,

23:08.933 --> 23:12.051
I got into some trouble
when I was younger.

23:12.053 --> 23:13.686
I got in a lot of trouble.

23:13.688 --> 23:15.271
[laughing]

23:15.273 --> 23:16.656
It was either the service
or juvie,

23:16.658 --> 23:18.524
so I chose service.

23:18.526 --> 23:21.077
Well, hey, at least now
you're a big hero.

23:22.046 --> 23:24.163
Can I ask you a favor?

23:24.165 --> 23:26.499
No way. Let me guess. Don't
tell Justine any of this?

23:26.501 --> 23:28.868
Yeah, lay off
the "hero" thing?

23:28.870 --> 23:30.736
Heroes are in comic books.

23:30.738 --> 23:32.839
I just did my job.

23:34.392 --> 23:36.142
Copy that.

23:41.449 --> 23:43.549
Hey, Bob.

23:44.619 --> 23:45.718
Everything okay?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.621
Yeah. Peggy's angry at me.

23:48.623 --> 23:50.990
When she's happy,
she cooks and bakes.

23:50.992 --> 23:54.393
Ah. And when
she's angry?

23:54.395 --> 23:56.696
She didn't even leave me
milk.

23:56.698 --> 23:57.763
[laughing]

23:57.765 --> 23:59.482
And the guests?

23:59.484 --> 24:01.834
Well, she seems to cook
just enough

24:01.836 --> 24:03.336
really good food for them.

24:03.338 --> 24:04.804
Ah.

24:04.806 --> 24:06.455
Hi, Jack.

24:06.457 --> 24:08.040
Hey.

24:08.042 --> 24:09.575
Uh, listen,

24:09.577 --> 24:10.626
I was hoping that

24:10.628 --> 24:12.111
I could get help
with something.

24:12.113 --> 24:15.081
Let's take a walk.
It's crowded in here.

24:16.251 --> 24:18.985
Okay.

24:18.987 --> 24:22.021
I was, uh, hoping that you
could help me with Olivia.

24:22.023 --> 24:24.073
Oh. Tell me more.

24:24.075 --> 24:25.825
- All right.
- Come on.

24:30.365 --> 24:31.464
[knock]

24:32.800 --> 24:33.983
Hey, sis.

24:33.985 --> 24:35.468
Will.

24:35.470 --> 24:38.471
Can we talk about Justine?

24:39.307 --> 24:40.506
She wants to move out.

24:40.508 --> 24:41.641
I've offered her
money to do it,

24:41.643 --> 24:43.042
but she knows
you wouldn't approve,

24:43.044 --> 24:44.060
and so she's turned me down.

24:44.062 --> 24:45.578
She can stay at home.

24:45.580 --> 24:46.679
She doesn't want to.

24:46.681 --> 24:47.947
Stay out of this.

24:47.949 --> 24:49.148
She wants me in it.

24:50.184 --> 24:51.584
She's my niece.

24:51.586 --> 24:52.351
She's my daughter.

24:52.353 --> 24:54.020
Okay, it's clear

24:54.022 --> 24:55.922
why you don't
want her to move.

24:55.924 --> 24:57.623
I mean, she can see it
and I can see it.

24:57.625 --> 24:58.724
It's why,

24:58.726 --> 25:00.026
even if she had
the money and a job,

25:00.028 --> 25:01.661
she probably wouldn't
follow through with it.

25:01.663 --> 25:02.962
Oh, this should be good.

25:02.964 --> 25:04.530
Then you would lose control,

25:04.532 --> 25:06.799
and if she moves, then
you'd be alone again, right?

25:08.536 --> 25:10.102
The door was open.
I-I should have knocked.

25:10.104 --> 25:11.087
Sorry.

25:11.089 --> 25:12.071
That's okay.

25:12.073 --> 25:13.706
Will, this is Paul.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.875
Paul, this is
my brother, Will.

25:15.877 --> 25:17.126
- Hi.
- Hi, Paul.

25:17.128 --> 25:18.661
And he was just leaving.

25:28.356 --> 25:30.006
Shake hard enough

25:30.008 --> 25:34.293
and, uh, every family tree
has a "Will."

25:35.863 --> 25:37.179
Mine's Peter.

25:37.181 --> 25:39.231
Lives in Boca
with the parents.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.716
Uh...

25:41.803 --> 25:42.985
Look, I need you.

25:42.987 --> 25:44.437
Tonight.

25:44.439 --> 25:45.938
Night court. No joke.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.523
- I'm up against a wall.
- You've got Judge Thomas.

25:47.525 --> 25:48.608
Food poisoning.

25:48.610 --> 25:49.742
You have got to find
someone else,

25:49.744 --> 25:51.277
because I have a date with
Jack.

25:51.279 --> 25:53.946
I'll buy you dinner, after,
and I'll apologize to Jack.

25:53.948 --> 25:55.848
Look, because of Anthony,
a lot of those cases

25:55.850 --> 25:58.117
are up against their
statute of limitations.

25:58.119 --> 26:00.186
If you don't hear them
tonight,

26:00.188 --> 26:02.221
they'll never be heard,

26:02.223 --> 26:05.057
and justice won't be done.

26:05.059 --> 26:06.993
You are invoking "justice"?

26:06.995 --> 26:07.995
I'm desperate.

26:07.996 --> 26:09.362
Please? <i> Please?</i>

26:09.364 --> 26:11.897
I've never seen
this side of you.

26:11.899 --> 26:14.000
Very few have.

26:14.002 --> 26:16.168
Hmm.

26:16.170 --> 26:18.270
Please.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.674
Hey, Olivia.

26:21.676 --> 26:23.943
Are you on your way?

26:24.979 --> 26:28.180
Oh.

26:28.182 --> 26:31.217
No, no. I understand.
It's night court.

26:33.338 --> 26:35.554
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

26:35.556 --> 26:37.990
Okay. Bye.

26:37.992 --> 26:40.426
Where's Olivia?

26:40.428 --> 26:42.528
[sighing heavily]

26:51.953 --> 26:54.470
Okay, First case,
please approach.

27:02.197 --> 27:04.914
Am I reading this correctly?

27:04.916 --> 27:06.683
Yes. Vandalism.

27:06.685 --> 27:08.218
With toilet paper?

27:08.220 --> 27:10.820
[Paul]:
With a lot of toilet paper.

27:10.822 --> 27:12.055
What's her name?

27:12.057 --> 27:13.623
E-Excuse me?

27:13.625 --> 27:15.091
The girl that you like,

27:15.093 --> 27:16.993
that lives in the house
that you toilet papered.

27:16.995 --> 27:18.895
Jill.

27:18.897 --> 27:20.263
Okay, I hereby sentence you

27:20.265 --> 27:22.532
to clean up the house
that you vandalized,

27:22.534 --> 27:25.368
but I also sentence you
to pick up the phone

27:25.370 --> 27:26.736
and ask Jill out.

27:26.738 --> 27:28.171
Now, the second part
is not mandatory,

27:28.173 --> 27:30.840
but highly recommended.

27:31.710 --> 27:32.775
[clack]

27:37.849 --> 27:40.416
Think of all the justice
you're dispensing.

27:40.418 --> 27:43.286
Yes, surely, today's ruling
will ensure

27:43.288 --> 27:46.889
that toilet paper is only used
for its lawful intended purpose,

27:46.891 --> 27:50.093
and Jill will have
a date to prom.

27:50.095 --> 27:52.161
And you're a big part of
that.

27:55.867 --> 27:57.634
[heavy sigh]

27:57.636 --> 27:59.469
You know, I got to be honest.

27:59.471 --> 28:02.505
This isn't quite the evening
that I had planned.

28:02.507 --> 28:03.473
Yeah.

28:03.475 --> 28:04.807
Well, at least
the food is good.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.509
- I'm starved.
- Clearly.

28:06.511 --> 28:08.161
You do know that
the Captain's Galley

28:08.163 --> 28:10.213
has good take-out,
don't you?

28:10.215 --> 28:12.248
This will all blow over.

28:13.618 --> 28:16.019
Not until you apologize.

28:16.021 --> 28:17.904
I'm not wrong.

28:17.906 --> 28:19.756
Starting a new
catering business?

28:19.758 --> 28:21.507
It's too much for us.

28:21.509 --> 28:23.326
This isn't about
you and Peggy,

28:23.328 --> 28:24.694
this is about Peggy.

28:24.696 --> 28:26.262
What she does, I do.

28:26.264 --> 28:27.263
That's the way
it's always been,

28:27.265 --> 28:30.199
and I don't want
a catering business.

28:30.201 --> 28:32.769
Ah.

28:32.771 --> 28:34.904
Do you want Peggy
to be happy?

28:34.906 --> 28:37.006
Yeah. I love her.

28:37.008 --> 28:40.777
Then you need to find
a way to make her happy.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.649
That's good advice.

28:48.470 --> 28:50.486
Maybe you should
listen to yourself.

28:51.956 --> 28:54.057
I am trying
to make Olivia happy.

28:54.059 --> 28:55.458
That's why I want us
to move in together.

28:55.460 --> 28:59.162
Is that to make, um...
you happy, or her?

28:59.164 --> 29:01.364
Make you feel more secure?

29:01.366 --> 29:02.699
Or her?

29:02.701 --> 29:03.833
It's for both of us.

29:03.835 --> 29:05.268
You sure about that?

29:08.106 --> 29:10.106
Defendant
received a ticket for going

29:10.108 --> 29:12.008
48 miles an hour
in a school zone.

29:12.010 --> 29:13.476
It was an emergency,
Your Honor.

29:13.478 --> 29:14.444
Really?

29:14.446 --> 29:15.411
No.

29:15.413 --> 29:16.479
Honesty.

29:16.481 --> 29:17.780
Refreshing.

29:17.782 --> 29:18.681
At least you weren't texting.

29:18.683 --> 29:19.932
I was.

29:19.934 --> 29:22.719
You need to stop being
so refreshingly honest.

29:22.721 --> 29:24.420
And you need
to never text and drive,

29:24.422 --> 29:26.322
and you need to slow down,

29:26.324 --> 29:28.658
and you need to pay the
fine, which I just doubled.

29:28.660 --> 29:30.760
[gavel clacks]

29:35.083 --> 29:37.400
Are people
coming in here twice?

29:37.402 --> 29:38.801
I could swear

29:38.803 --> 29:40.136
I saw that man with the
rooster in here earlier.

29:40.138 --> 29:42.555
No. There's only one guy
with a rooster.

29:44.109 --> 29:46.442
Tonight.

29:50.982 --> 29:53.166
Here you go, Buck.
On the house.

29:53.168 --> 29:55.001
Thanks, Moon.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.653
Better than
any coffee in New York,

29:57.655 --> 29:59.288
and it's one-third
the price.

29:59.290 --> 30:00.640
You know, it's hilarious,

30:00.642 --> 30:01.891
because I've been
coming here for years

30:01.893 --> 30:05.294
and I've never received
a free cup of coffee.

30:05.296 --> 30:06.713
I'm pleasant to them.
They're pleasant to me.

30:06.715 --> 30:07.680
It's not that tough, Warren.

30:07.682 --> 30:08.781
Yeah, that's
fascinating, Dad.

30:08.783 --> 30:10.400
Look, we need to talk
about some business.

30:10.402 --> 30:11.501
You want to know

30:11.503 --> 30:13.202
why I canceled
your company credit cards?

30:13.204 --> 30:14.470
- Mm-hmm. -It has nothing
to do with Alex.

30:14.472 --> 30:15.655
I think it does.

30:15.657 --> 30:17.407
Nope. You remember
when you were 16?

30:17.409 --> 30:19.442
You wrecked my car,
and I took away the keys?

30:19.444 --> 30:20.610
Well, you show me

30:20.612 --> 30:21.978
you can be responsible again,

30:21.980 --> 30:25.064
you get the credit cards
back.

30:29.337 --> 30:30.887
Wow.

30:32.690 --> 30:35.224
Enjoy your free
cup of coffee, Dad.

30:40.965 --> 30:43.716
I'm gonna have to run
two extra miles tomorrow.

30:43.718 --> 30:46.619
Noodles are like
my kryptonite.

30:46.621 --> 30:48.404
[both munching]

30:48.406 --> 30:50.206
So you and Jack
are big runners?

30:50.208 --> 30:51.641
[laughing] No.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.743
Jack does not exercise.

30:53.745 --> 30:55.128
Mm. I think I'd die.

30:55.130 --> 30:56.279
The stress release.

30:56.281 --> 30:57.480
Mm. Me too.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.282
Oh! Nice ruling...

30:59.284 --> 31:01.851
on the free-range
rooster case,

31:01.853 --> 31:03.052
by the way.

31:03.054 --> 31:04.054
[laughing]

31:04.055 --> 31:05.788
I love night court.

31:05.790 --> 31:07.390
Why?

31:07.392 --> 31:09.859
It's not about
closing arguments

31:09.861 --> 31:11.894
or getting your name
in the paper,

31:11.896 --> 31:14.030
or some ruling that's
gonna change law,

31:14.032 --> 31:15.631
it's about people.

31:15.633 --> 31:17.900
Like, real people.

31:18.803 --> 31:19.869
And at the end of the day,

31:19.871 --> 31:22.505
sometimes, real people

31:22.507 --> 31:24.607
need real help...

31:24.609 --> 31:27.376
just to live their lives.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.179
I like being a part of that.

31:30.181 --> 31:31.247
You know.

31:31.249 --> 31:33.182
Roosters and...

31:33.184 --> 31:36.285
toilet paper and grouches.

31:36.287 --> 31:37.887
It's why
I went to law school.

31:37.889 --> 31:39.489
Really?

31:39.491 --> 31:41.474
Yeah.

31:41.476 --> 31:44.927
My Dad had a diner.

31:44.929 --> 31:46.729
Small, family-run.

31:46.731 --> 31:49.966
Someone slipped on some water

31:49.968 --> 31:51.901
and I watched
as the legal system

31:51.903 --> 31:54.036
helped take that diner
away from him.

31:55.139 --> 31:57.940
And he didn't
need Clarence Darrow.

31:57.942 --> 32:02.442
You know, he just needed
a good, solid lawyer.

32:03.348 --> 32:04.947
Then he wouldn't have

32:04.949 --> 32:07.069
lost everything that he spent
his whole life building.

32:12.290 --> 32:14.524
I, um...

32:14.526 --> 32:16.993
I feel like
I'm cheating on Jack.

32:16.995 --> 32:19.328
Yeah? How?

32:19.330 --> 32:20.830
[laughs]

32:20.832 --> 32:24.233
Oh, it's just
the Chinese food.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.935
It's something we do.

32:25.937 --> 32:27.053
It's silly.

32:27.055 --> 32:28.838
It's your thing.

32:28.840 --> 32:31.207
Yeah. It's our thing.

32:31.209 --> 32:32.942
Did you and your wife
have a "thing"?

32:32.944 --> 32:34.227
Yeah...

32:34.229 --> 32:35.778
fighting.

32:35.780 --> 32:37.213
Mostly.

32:37.215 --> 32:39.849
[laughs]

32:40.952 --> 32:42.785
It's late.

32:42.787 --> 32:44.520
I'd better go.

32:47.492 --> 32:49.892
Thanks, Olivia.

33:13.534 --> 33:16.002
[sander buzzing]

33:23.628 --> 33:24.727
Hi, Bob.

33:25.947 --> 33:28.497
You're talking to me.

33:28.499 --> 33:31.000
Grace asked me to run
the town event committee.

33:31.002 --> 33:33.269
Uh-huh?

33:33.271 --> 33:34.737
Because you
asked Grace to ask me.

33:34.739 --> 33:36.772
Is it something
you want to do?

33:36.774 --> 33:38.391
I do.

33:38.393 --> 33:39.775
And I told her so.

33:39.777 --> 33:40.876
It's not catering.

33:40.878 --> 33:43.245
Yes, but it's using
my skills to help out,

33:43.247 --> 33:44.513
and that's what I want to do.

33:44.515 --> 33:47.116
Staying busy keeps us young.

33:47.118 --> 33:48.217
Yes.

33:48.219 --> 33:50.586
And I want you on
the committee with me.

33:53.057 --> 33:55.224
Please?

33:55.226 --> 33:57.994
Hmm...

33:59.197 --> 34:01.097
Will I get fed regularly?

34:01.099 --> 34:03.132
Yes.

34:03.968 --> 34:05.701
[both chuckling]

34:05.703 --> 34:07.837
Mm.

34:13.444 --> 34:16.746
So you want to hire me
to be your assistant?

34:16.748 --> 34:19.248
That way, it's not
me giving you money.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.150
But it is.

34:21.152 --> 34:22.885
No. It's a real job,

34:22.887 --> 34:24.754
you're gonna have
to earn your keep.

34:24.755 --> 34:26.522
Even Olivia would approve.

34:26.524 --> 34:27.757
I talked to her.

34:27.759 --> 34:30.192
You did?

34:30.194 --> 34:32.161
She thinks it's a great idea.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.034
[♪♪]

34:45.476 --> 34:48.194
[plays video clip]

34:48.196 --> 34:51.480
<i>[reporters clamoring]</i>

34:52.717 --> 34:55.134
[chuckles]

35:03.405 --> 35:04.754
[gasps] Oh!

35:04.756 --> 35:09.256
Well, you're finally here!

35:10.612 --> 35:11.911
We're all here.

35:11.913 --> 35:13.463
Together.

35:13.465 --> 35:14.797
So spit it out!

35:14.799 --> 35:15.782
Come on, get to it, you two.

35:15.784 --> 35:17.200
- Mom?
- Are you okay?

35:17.202 --> 35:18.668
Oh! Just tell me.

35:18.670 --> 35:20.586
For the love of--
please, just tell me.

35:20.588 --> 35:21.871
Because I have been so
patient,

35:21.873 --> 35:23.189
and I have waited,

35:23.191 --> 35:24.440
and I have knitted, oh, boy,

35:24.442 --> 35:25.575
have I knitted.

35:25.577 --> 35:26.876
And I think I deserve to
know--

35:26.878 --> 35:27.927
in fact,
I demand to know right now.

35:27.929 --> 35:29.746
So tell me.
Let's go.

35:29.748 --> 35:32.749
Wh-- uh, knitted? What
are you knitting for me?

35:32.751 --> 35:35.401
No! Not for you,
for the baby.

35:35.403 --> 35:36.319
What baby?

35:36.321 --> 35:37.321
Your baby!

35:37.322 --> 35:38.287
Baby?

35:38.289 --> 35:39.472
Yeah! You're pregnant!

35:39.474 --> 35:40.590
Oh, whoa--
you're pregnant?

35:40.592 --> 35:41.891
- Yes!
- No!

35:41.893 --> 35:43.192
Wait, Maryellen,
what's going on?

35:43.194 --> 35:44.327
Um, Mom?

35:44.329 --> 35:45.495
[stammers]

35:45.497 --> 35:48.131
Okay, I know
you wanted to surprise me,

35:48.133 --> 35:50.266
but I did figure it out.

35:50.268 --> 35:53.469
I'm not pregnant.

35:54.873 --> 35:57.039
You're not?
Okay, now I'm surprised.

35:57.041 --> 35:59.092
But I heard you--
I heard you on the phone.

35:59.094 --> 36:00.760
You were saying "Our baby."

36:00.762 --> 36:02.195
Oh...

36:02.197 --> 36:04.247
"Oh," what? What "oh"?

36:05.316 --> 36:08.417
John has some
investors in New York

36:08.419 --> 36:10.286
who want to back him
in his own place.

36:10.288 --> 36:12.054
That's why he was late.

36:12.056 --> 36:14.190
Mr. McKay, the owner
of the Captain's Galley,

36:14.192 --> 36:15.241
is selling.

36:15.243 --> 36:16.993
We're moving back.

36:16.995 --> 36:19.962
I'm going to turn the walls into
a gallery of local artists,

36:19.964 --> 36:21.931
and John
is going to be the chef.

36:21.933 --> 36:24.350
So you're-- you're actually
moving back home?

36:25.787 --> 36:27.670
So when you do have a baby,
then it'll be here?

36:27.672 --> 36:28.704
Mm-hmm.

36:28.706 --> 36:30.673
Oh! This calls
for some champagne,

36:30.675 --> 36:31.941
which, of course,
you can drink now

36:31.943 --> 36:34.610
because you're not pregnant!
Okay!

36:34.612 --> 36:36.746
Oh!

36:36.748 --> 36:38.614
[whispers]: I really
wish we didn't tell her.

36:38.616 --> 36:41.717
There's a problem...
with the investors.

36:50.245 --> 36:51.444
Hey!

36:51.446 --> 36:52.845
Why don't you
come out with us today?

36:52.847 --> 36:53.796
Yeah?

36:53.798 --> 36:55.314
Yeah, okay. Great.

36:55.316 --> 36:56.599
I mean, it's nothing
to write home about it,

36:56.601 --> 36:57.767
but we could use an extra
man.

36:57.769 --> 36:59.485
No, yeah, I got it,
I'm your man.

36:59.487 --> 37:01.370
Well, finish up
and jump onboard.

37:01.372 --> 37:02.538
Aye-aye.

37:04.342 --> 37:06.309
[laughs]

37:07.178 --> 37:08.678
What?

37:08.680 --> 37:11.047
I won't call you
a "hero" again,

37:11.049 --> 37:12.165
if you promise to never say
"Aye-aye" again. Deal?

37:12.167 --> 37:13.499
Yeah. Deal.

37:14.586 --> 37:17.220
- "Captain"?
- That's better!

37:19.691 --> 37:22.291
[engine chugging]

37:32.070 --> 37:35.004
I finished the 40
case recommendations.

37:35.006 --> 37:36.539
They're on your desk.

37:36.541 --> 37:37.623
You win.

37:37.625 --> 37:40.376
I tried to bury you
in needless paperwork

37:40.378 --> 37:42.011
and you boomeranged me,

37:42.013 --> 37:44.480
sent the paper right back.

37:44.482 --> 37:47.483
I have paper-cuts
on my paper-cuts.

37:47.485 --> 37:48.384
[laughing]

37:48.386 --> 37:50.753
You got me.

37:50.755 --> 37:52.388
Well, of course, I did.

37:52.390 --> 37:55.141
I have years
of experience on you.

37:56.027 --> 37:57.310
But you...

37:57.312 --> 38:00.196
are gonna be
a great attorney.

38:01.115 --> 38:02.198
So...

38:02.200 --> 38:03.566
You ready to learn

38:03.568 --> 38:05.768
something other than
frustration now?

38:05.770 --> 38:07.003
Yes.

38:07.005 --> 38:08.387
Do you want to learn?

38:08.389 --> 38:10.306
[sighs heavily]
I hate this.

38:10.308 --> 38:12.341
What, being outplayed?

38:12.343 --> 38:13.509
Or the fact
that I'm your boss

38:13.511 --> 38:15.278
and I get to tell you
what to do?

38:17.148 --> 38:19.081
See you in the morning,
Miss Jennings.

38:20.702 --> 38:23.252
Well done.

38:27.725 --> 38:29.892
[knocking at door]

38:31.729 --> 38:33.729
Well, Bob and I
had a lovely time.

38:33.731 --> 38:35.665
I was stuck.
I had to do night court.

38:35.667 --> 38:38.884
I know, it's okay.

38:38.886 --> 38:42.722
Although it was supposed to
be my big, grand gesture

38:42.724 --> 38:45.808
to show you
how much I care about you,

38:45.810 --> 38:49.312
and how committed
I am to you, to us.

38:49.314 --> 38:51.998
I didn't know you'd planned
something special.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.215
[takes a deep breath]

38:53.217 --> 38:54.750
Olivia, this is just...

38:54.752 --> 38:55.752
What?

38:55.753 --> 38:57.753
[Jack sighs]

38:59.390 --> 39:02.608
I mean, do you even want
to move in together?

39:02.610 --> 39:06.028
I don't want to make a mistake
trying to fix a mistake.

39:06.030 --> 39:07.280
My mistake?

39:07.282 --> 39:08.698
Yes.

39:08.700 --> 39:09.815
Um...

39:09.817 --> 39:10.900
you know,

39:10.902 --> 39:12.201
before all of this
happened--

39:12.203 --> 39:13.786
Jack.

39:13.788 --> 39:14.904
You didn't miss my birthday.

39:14.906 --> 39:16.238
You were drinking,

39:16.240 --> 39:18.991
hanging out with your
ex-wife,

39:18.993 --> 39:22.078
not being truthful with me.

39:22.914 --> 39:24.463
[sighs]

39:29.387 --> 39:32.221
Um... [sighing]

39:33.758 --> 39:35.224
I messed up.

39:35.226 --> 39:38.311
Big-time.

39:38.313 --> 39:40.646
And, uh...

39:40.648 --> 39:44.100
I convinced myself that I
didn't have a problem.

39:45.353 --> 39:47.520
And then I saw
the look on your face.

39:49.190 --> 39:50.990
[sighs]

39:50.992 --> 39:53.326
Let's just say
I was lying to both of us.

39:57.999 --> 40:01.117
Look, Olivia...

40:01.119 --> 40:04.120
I just need to know
if you think

40:04.122 --> 40:05.838
that you can get past this.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.289
I need to know.

40:07.291 --> 40:09.675
Give me more than
three seconds

40:09.677 --> 40:12.128
to figure out how I feel.

40:12.130 --> 40:14.714
Why do I think that...

40:14.716 --> 40:15.965
ahem,

40:15.967 --> 40:17.383
if I gave you three months,

40:17.385 --> 40:20.269
you wouldn't know
how you feel?

40:20.271 --> 40:21.721
You can't pressure me

40:21.723 --> 40:24.807
into figuring it out
any faster than I can.

40:24.809 --> 40:26.859
[sighing wearily]

40:26.861 --> 40:28.694
You know, Olivia,

40:28.696 --> 40:31.113
it is not easy

40:31.115 --> 40:35.117
being the guy who is always
letting you down, you know?

40:35.119 --> 40:37.319
[laughing]
Wait a minute now!

40:37.321 --> 40:41.821
Don't try to turn me
into the bad guy.

40:41.993 --> 40:44.243
I didn't cause
this situation.

40:44.245 --> 40:45.961
You did.

40:45.963 --> 40:48.664
Even if you didn't
have Night Court,

40:48.666 --> 40:50.216
you would've come up
with some excuse

40:50.218 --> 40:52.301
not to show up
last night, right?

40:52.303 --> 40:53.836
You don't want
to talk about this.

40:53.838 --> 40:56.138
You want something from me
that I can't give you.

40:56.140 --> 40:57.840
What, forgiveness?

41:00.978 --> 41:02.178
You said you did,

41:02.180 --> 41:03.512
but you don't forgive me,
do you?

41:08.319 --> 41:10.186
More pressure?

41:13.024 --> 41:17.524
Right.

41:18.529 --> 41:21.030
