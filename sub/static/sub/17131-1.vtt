01:33.783 --> 01:34.909
Until something happens...

01:34.992 --> 01:38.037
my plan is to stay in this wonderful bar of ours and get drunk.

01:38.079 --> 01:41.207
The locals are torching your flag.

01:41.291 --> 01:42.375
You know, we should film them.

01:42.459 --> 01:45.170
When they burn something interesting I will hit record.

01:45.253 --> 01:46.506
Like the new President?

01:46.532 --> 01:47.214
Amirev?

01:47.255 --> 01:49.675
Amirev.
The question is, will he last?

01:49.758 --> 01:51.635
<i>Well, he made it through the first week.</i>

01:51.718 --> 01:54.221
<i>The people love him and he won the election fair and square.</i>

01:54.262 --> 01:58.183
<i>Our reluctant loser, Kirilov, has other plans for Amirev.</i>

01:58.266 --> 01:59.351
Stop! IDs please.

01:59.434 --> 02:01.895
I'm here to collect Commander Sam Keenan.

02:02.229 --> 02:03.420
Thank you, sir.

02:03.446 --> 02:04.715
Thank you.

02:06.775 --> 02:10.029
So, nobody's going to the airport to pick up your new Ambassador?

02:10.112 --> 02:12.448
New second-in-command, Deputy Ambassador...

02:12.489 --> 02:14.366
ain't worth changing shirts for.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.243
That's not who they're flying in today.

02:16.285 --> 02:18.621
I've heard it's the new military attaché.

02:18.871 --> 02:21.416
<i>Military attaché, interesting></i>

02:25.128 --> 02:28.881
<i>You know, word on the street is the militia with Kirilov are planning a coup.</i>

02:28.964 --> 02:32.385
Amirev knows that he has a serious insurgency problem on his hands.

02:32.468 --> 02:34.929
He also knows that his army simply isn't up to handling it.

02:34.971 --> 02:36.055
Yeah, no shit.

02:36.139 --> 02:38.808
Which is exactly why Norland requested this guy.

02:38.891 --> 02:42.604
<i>He's the kind of guy you definitely want
on your team if you're expecting trouble.</i>

02:42.687 --> 02:47.442
<i>And let's face it, the US are taking this insurgency problem very seriously.</i>

02:50.487 --> 02:52.072
<i>So, who is he?</i>

02:52.906 --> 02:54.241
His name is Keenan.

02:54.325 --> 02:56.727
Commander Samuel Keenan.

02:56.753 --> 02:57.853
Navy SEAL.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.122
<i>He's the toughest guy I have ever met.</i>

03:01.665 --> 03:03.339
Your bag, sir.

03:03.365 --> 03:05.277
Thank you.

03:05.335 --> 03:07.462
- Sounds like you know him.
- Yeah.

03:07.671 --> 03:10.632
Michelle and I embedded with his team in El Basra.

03:10.674 --> 03:13.969
She however got to know him a little better than I did.

03:14.053 --> 03:15.096
Sir.

03:15.179 --> 03:19.142
<i>Oh, not our super clean Michelle "United World News" Whitman?</i>

03:19.225 --> 03:20.643
<i>The very same.</i>

03:21.060 --> 03:23.980
<i>Delta Four, requesting clearance for take-off.</i>

03:25.648 --> 03:29.611
<i>Michelle told me that he's coming by the hotel before he starts work.</i>

03:29.819 --> 03:31.695
<i>Lucky Miss Whitman.</i>

03:42.916 --> 03:45.118
What's your name, Corporal?

03:45.144 --> 03:46.611
Butler, sir.

03:47.045 --> 03:49.297
Do you know the Hotel Continental?

03:50.007 --> 03:52.551
Sir, my orders were to take you straight to the Embassy, sir.

03:52.634 --> 03:54.803
Then on to the Presidential Palace.

03:58.557 --> 04:01.352
But the hotel is kind of on the way.

04:02.728 --> 04:04.688
In the opposite direction.

04:11.445 --> 04:14.114
- Give me an hour, okay?
- Yes, sir.

04:38.514 --> 04:39.766
Who is it?

04:52.529 --> 04:53.697
How are you?

05:47.377 --> 05:49.838
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

05:50.630 --> 05:51.526
Hey, man.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.742
Journalist scum!

05:57.888 --> 05:59.098
Shit.

06:00.516 --> 06:01.475
Sam.

06:04.020 --> 06:05.146
Hey, buddy, stop.

06:05.188 --> 06:08.191
- Go home, we don't want you here!
- We're press!

06:09.400 --> 06:11.528
Foreigner news programs to leave!

06:24.374 --> 06:25.089
Out the door!

06:25.115 --> 06:26.818
I'll follow, I'll follow!

06:49.065 --> 06:50.348
Get out of the way.

06:50.374 --> 06:51.385
You, get down.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.904
- Sir, you okay?
- I'm fine.

06:53.987 --> 06:56.198
- Get some ambulances, now.
- Yes, sir.

06:56.281 --> 06:57.491
You, come on, let's get out of here.

06:57.574 --> 06:58.842
Michelle, you better come with me.

06:58.868 --> 07:00.060
You'll be safe at the Embassy.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.371
- I'm a reporter, Sam.
- Like him.

07:02.413 --> 07:04.916
You know where the phone is?
You, answer me.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.209
You want to be next?

07:06.292 --> 07:08.544
If we don't show the world what's happening, who will?

07:08.628 --> 07:10.547
Sam, you know me well enough by now.

07:10.588 --> 07:11.798
Sir, Civil Guards are on their way.

07:11.881 --> 07:14.801
You should not be here when they arrive.
Let's go.

07:14.885 --> 07:17.970
Stay off the streets and let me find out what's going on.

07:18.054 --> 07:19.597
Don't worry, Sam, we'll be fine.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.766
Michelle, I'll come back for you.

07:45.124 --> 07:47.710
Jesus Christ, that's gotta be a bomb.

07:48.085 --> 07:50.754
- What's there?
- It's the army barracks.

07:51.546 --> 07:53.453
This country is supposed to be stable.

07:53.479 --> 07:54.783
They just had elections.

07:54.842 --> 07:58.178
Well, someone didn't like the result.
Move on.

08:46.354 --> 08:47.853
Gunnery Sergeant Darnell.

08:47.879 --> 08:49.257
Commander Sam Keenan.

08:49.315 --> 08:50.775
Gunnery Sergeant.

08:51.359 --> 08:53.278
Gunny will do just fine, sir.

08:54.820 --> 08:57.698
- Nice town, huh?
- Sleepy.

08:57.865 --> 08:59.110
It has its moments.

08:59.136 --> 09:00.643
Good to meet you, sir.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.338
Commander Keenan.

09:04.364 --> 09:05.940
I'm Jennifer Lennard.

09:05.998 --> 09:06.923
Nice to meet you.

09:06.949 --> 09:08.526
Right this way, please.

09:08.876 --> 09:11.379
Ambassador Norland speaks very highly of you.

09:11.421 --> 09:13.214
George?
 He's a good man.

09:13.506 --> 09:17.010
I get the feeling this town is going to need him more than ever.

09:23.142 --> 09:24.852
He's right through here.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.155
Sam, how are you, son?

09:37.239 --> 09:39.491
Ambassador, sorry, I got delayed.

09:39.575 --> 09:41.910
Our RSO, John Lydon.

09:42.202 --> 09:44.079
Marine Detachment Commander John Baldwin.

09:44.163 --> 09:46.874
Our new military attaché, Commander Keenan.

09:46.916 --> 09:49.335
Welcome to the deep end, Commander Keenan.

09:49.544 --> 09:51.045
Here's the top sheet.

09:51.254 --> 09:55.383
A small cadre of insurgents, former military and loyal to ex-president Kirilov...

09:55.425 --> 09:57.886
are stirring up opposition to the new president.

09:57.927 --> 09:59.929
This man is their leader, Tavarov...

10:00.012 --> 10:02.723
who obviously ordered the hit on the journalists' hotel.

10:02.807 --> 10:06.936
They're hardliners, old school communist, violently anti-US.

10:07.019 --> 10:10.064
But mainly street corner show boaters, until now.

10:14.861 --> 10:16.016
Comrade Tavarov.

10:16.042 --> 10:17.556
It's time, now.

10:18.073 --> 10:19.741
- Luca.
- Sir.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.576
Move in.

10:51.899 --> 10:53.359
You sure you're all right to do this?

10:53.443 --> 10:55.904
Your boyfriend was pretty insistent that we stay out of trouble.

10:55.987 --> 10:57.614
Well, trouble has a way of finding me.

10:57.697 --> 10:59.366
How do you think I met him in the first place?

10:59.449 --> 11:01.851
This place is about to blow, you can feel it.

11:01.877 --> 11:02.477
Come on.

11:07.957 --> 11:09.250
Ambassador.

11:10.209 --> 11:11.277
Frank Gaines.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.862
CIA Station Chief.

11:12.921 --> 11:15.674
Our new military attaché, Commander Keenan.

11:16.216 --> 11:18.093
They still call you B.C.?

11:19.010 --> 11:20.011
What do you mean?

11:20.095 --> 11:24.099
Well, you go to a hotel, a half hour later we have a body count of eight.

11:25.058 --> 11:26.569
Frank, Sam is on our side.

11:26.595 --> 11:28.629
So were those dead reporters.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.274
Now, what's your intel on the gunmen and the bombers?

11:32.358 --> 11:37.154
Well, we have one major explosion and three smaller blasts.

11:37.738 --> 11:41.450
My contacts report roving bands of militia, maybe as many as 500.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.994
They've taken out the military barracks here...

11:44.036 --> 11:46.539
and the Civil Guard HQ here.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.959
They've shot up US business interests too.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.879
We have unconfirmed American casualties.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.548
What about the rest of the army?

11:55.632 --> 11:58.009
President Amirev sent General Borgov...

11:58.051 --> 12:01.012
to take out what we thought was a militia base camp.

12:01.596 --> 12:05.183
Satellite pictures show he's turned back from the mountains...

12:05.726 --> 12:07.936
so I'd say five hours, minimum.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.857
I'll give you three to one on Amirev swinging from a rope by midnight.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.243
As the capital falls into anarchy...

12:23.285 --> 12:26.914
the rioters have cut the President off from both his military and police.

12:26.997 --> 12:31.419
Amirev needs his army who are reportedly hours away in the mountains.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.932
- Yes, Comrade.
- Shoot.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.058
Yes, sir.

13:06.622 --> 13:07.867
Where did that come from?

13:07.893 --> 13:10.234
One of the Palace Guards has opened fire.

13:24.806 --> 13:26.090
You getting any of this?

13:26.116 --> 13:27.292
Yeah, all of it.

13:29.103 --> 13:30.938
They're storming the palace.

14:00.009 --> 14:02.596
"Our palace guards have opened fire Mr. President."

14:04.598 --> 14:06.424
"On my own people?

14:06.450 --> 14:09.086
Who gave such an order?"

14:09.144 --> 14:10.231
"They are jumpy sir.

14:10.257 --> 14:11.505
It's understandable."

14:12.815 --> 14:16.902
"My army could restore order immediately, yet they are still hours away."

14:17.320 --> 14:20.197
"But sir, we've lost contact with General Borgov."

14:21.031 --> 14:22.091
"The airport is open.

14:22.117 --> 14:23.934
I have organized a plane for you."

14:23.992 --> 14:28.664
"A plane?
When all other options are closed?"

14:28.747 --> 14:32.752
"Why does so obvious an escape remain open to me?"

14:33.878 --> 14:35.338
"Have Captain Servat come in."

14:35.379 --> 14:37.507
"You must leave now, sir."

14:39.258 --> 14:42.220
"Put my Chief of Staff under arrest."

14:44.931 --> 14:45.932
"Mr. President?"

14:46.016 --> 14:47.350
"I don't need his advice any longer."

14:47.434 --> 14:49.436
"Mr. President!"

14:53.314 --> 14:55.108
Ambassador Norland, please.

14:56.192 --> 14:59.779
<i>The militia are clearly encouraging the people to press forward.</i>

15:13.043 --> 15:14.640
How many marines do we have?

15:14.666 --> 15:16.922
How many people do we have to protect?

15:16.964 --> 15:19.216
Officially an Embassy staff of 27.

15:19.258 --> 15:23.387
Plus 42 other US nationals in the city, mostly oil and telecom engineers.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.889
Marine Embassy Guard detachment of 15.

15:25.931 --> 15:27.975
Fifteen? That's it?

15:28.058 --> 15:31.353
This was not considered a hazardous duty station.

15:31.437 --> 15:33.773
- Look outside, Mr. Gaines. - I know.

15:33.856 --> 15:35.566
That was President Amirev.

15:35.775 --> 15:37.902
Communists are storming the Presidential Palace.

15:37.944 --> 15:40.905
- And?
- He wants our help.

15:41.030 --> 15:43.491
So, tell him people in hell want ice cubes.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.535
How many weapons and transport do we have?

15:45.618 --> 15:46.828
Whoa, hold on a second there, B.C.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.207
I see where you're going with this.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.231
It's not going to happen.

15:49.289 --> 15:51.667
Sir, the Secretary of State would have our asses.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.919
If we're gonna do something, we're better to move now.

15:53.961 --> 15:55.846
Yeah, yeah, well, with all due respect...

15:55.872 --> 15:57.113
Hear him out, Gaines.

15:57.171 --> 15:59.340
Those marines see any action?

15:59.424 --> 16:03.094
Gunny, Butler, and Zanger all spent a tour in Iraq.

16:03.178 --> 16:04.262
Works for me.

16:04.288 --> 16:06.706
Get me in, I'll get him out.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.101
Do it.

16:10.769 --> 16:11.854
Follow me.

16:14.189 --> 16:15.316
Sam.

16:15.816 --> 16:18.444
Since we still haven't replaced my former deputy...

16:18.527 --> 16:21.280
I'm appointing you to temporarily fill the slot.

16:21.489 --> 16:23.491
You're my new second-in-command.

16:39.173 --> 16:40.675
Less protesters back here.

16:40.717 --> 16:42.802
- It's fully loaded, sir.
- Thank you.

16:42.844 --> 16:45.346
Pull up here,
I should be able to go this way.

16:50.060 --> 16:51.812
Service entrance to the palace.

16:51.895 --> 16:55.482
Shit, those Palace Guards look like they've got their hands full.

16:58.235 --> 16:59.694
Make sure they keep holding.

17:08.662 --> 17:10.163
There's Sam.

17:39.902 --> 17:41.696
You're the gentleman who will assist my travel?

17:41.779 --> 17:42.493
Yes, sir.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.265
Where is your driver?

18:03.386 --> 18:04.594
Follow me.

18:08.014 --> 18:09.308
<i>Sam, we've got a problem.</i>

18:09.391 --> 18:10.320
Mobs coming through.

18:10.346 --> 18:12.669
They're storming through the service office door.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.236
Switching to Plan "B."

18:21.070 --> 18:22.238
Follow me.

18:49.391 --> 18:51.601
Baldwin, cover us when we come out.

18:51.643 --> 18:53.145
<i>Copy, Sam, we're right behind you.</i>

18:53.186 --> 18:54.187
We've got movement.

18:54.271 --> 18:56.315
With just a handful of guards protecting the palace...

18:56.398 --> 18:58.150
and his most loyal generals many hours away...

18:58.233 --> 19:01.529
the feeling in the insurgents is one of "now or never."

19:27.055 --> 19:28.389
God, Sam!

19:47.617 --> 19:49.369
Keep your head down, sir.

20:29.244 --> 20:30.745
Let's get out of here.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.540
Yeah, we're out of here.

20:35.459 --> 20:36.752
Tavarov.

20:37.586 --> 20:39.129
<i>Cover the US Embassy.</i>

20:43.884 --> 20:45.927
<i>This is Tiger One, we got your back here.</i>

20:48.930 --> 20:50.891
<i>Let's roll back to the Embassy, sir.</i>

20:50.932 --> 20:51.858
Copy that.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.753
Hang back and cover our flank.

20:57.105 --> 20:59.529
<i>Gunny, we're coming in. Cover us.</i>

20:59.555 --> 21:02.052
<i>Roger, Sam.
Ready to deploy.</i>

21:08.034 --> 21:10.328
Watch it, we're cut off.

21:10.620 --> 21:12.121
<i>I got the rear, Sam.</i>

21:13.039 --> 21:15.041
Hold on, sir, I'll get you out.

21:18.294 --> 21:19.587
Brace yourself.

21:24.759 --> 21:25.968
I got it, go!

21:35.687 --> 21:37.481
Move out, cover the street!

21:38.231 --> 21:39.691
Pazzini, cover me!

21:51.161 --> 21:53.705
- Take him out!
- I've got it, go!

22:01.088 --> 22:02.798
Get up on the wall.

22:07.428 --> 22:09.138
Coming in from the left.

22:18.189 --> 22:20.192
Coming around, move!

22:23.235 --> 22:26.739
- Mr. President, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.950
Okay, come on.

22:29.284 --> 22:32.579
Sir, we'll have to make a run for it, okay?

22:38.335 --> 22:40.254
Grenade, give me your grenade!

22:43.132 --> 22:45.050
Go, get the hell out of here.

22:52.809 --> 22:54.893
Only shoot on my orders!

22:56.270 --> 22:57.338
Follow me.

22:57.364 --> 22:58.964
Go, go! Cover!

23:02.067 --> 23:04.779
Fire! Fire!

23:11.786 --> 23:14.122
Get those goddamn gates open!

23:19.961 --> 23:21.213
Over here!

23:24.633 --> 23:27.009
Incoming fire! Get down!

23:37.103 --> 23:38.647
Close the gates!

23:43.610 --> 23:45.112
They're pulling back.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.115
Welcome to the USA, Mr. President.

23:48.199 --> 23:49.004
Thank you.

23:49.030 --> 23:50.559
I am in your debt.

23:50.826 --> 23:53.579
Sir, the Ambassador is waiting inside.

23:54.122 --> 23:55.081
Sir.

23:56.791 --> 23:58.435
Corporal Zanger just radioed in.

23:58.461 --> 24:00.360
He and Pazzini are still out there.

24:00.419 --> 24:02.546
I'll assemble a reaction team and bring them both in.

24:02.630 --> 24:04.089
Negative, Gunny.

24:04.173 --> 24:07.259
The city is crawling with militia heading in our direction.

24:07.343 --> 24:08.928
I need all available men right now.

24:09.011 --> 24:11.013
Zanger and Pazzini are two of my best.

24:11.097 --> 24:13.433
I'm sure they are, and they're marines.

24:14.309 --> 24:17.604
- I'm counting on them out there.
- Yes, sir.

24:44.423 --> 24:48.677
Jones, left flank, Red, right flank!

24:48.844 --> 24:50.137
Move!

24:50.304 --> 24:51.764
Hold your position.

24:52.682 --> 24:56.102
<i>Attention, please, all civilian evacuees...</i>

24:56.185 --> 24:59.397
<i>please assemble in the lobby for a security briefing.</i>

24:59.481 --> 25:00.732
- Here you go.
- Hi.

25:01.483 --> 25:03.158
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

25:03.184 --> 25:04.093
Are you sure?

25:04.652 --> 25:06.404
Hell of a time for a tour group.

25:06.487 --> 25:08.450
They're US nationals who work in the city.

25:08.476 --> 25:10.391
We bussed them in for their own safety.

25:10.449 --> 25:12.285
We need to get control of our defenses.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.770
Is there a map of this place?

25:13.828 --> 25:16.080
Yeah, the Marine Unit is down the hall and to the left.

25:16.164 --> 25:18.208
ACR is in the basement through Comms.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.835
Come with me, I'll show you the Embassy plans.

25:20.919 --> 25:24.923
<i>Would evacuees please remain in the lobby and await further instructions.</i>

25:39.896 --> 25:42.024
They re-grouped at the top of the street, Gunny.

26:04.256 --> 26:07.050
Enough ammo to hold off a troop of girl scouts.

26:07.509 --> 26:11.053
Yeah, and the only anti-personnel weapon we've got is bad breath.

26:12.889 --> 26:14.599
I've spotted an RPG.

26:17.268 --> 26:19.646
I'll give the Ambassador the great news.

26:22.858 --> 26:25.944
Now, we do this the hard way.

26:27.946 --> 26:29.656
We don't have much time.

26:34.829 --> 26:37.498
<i>Let us know immediately if there's any change in your plans.</i>

26:44.463 --> 26:46.590
- Incoming!
- Get down!

27:06.736 --> 27:07.904
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:07.988 --> 27:10.365
- Call for backup, seal the windows.
- Right, sir.

27:12.284 --> 27:14.118
You two, on me!

27:25.881 --> 27:28.300
Get him downstairs into the bubble, now!

27:29.593 --> 27:30.636
You okay?

27:43.691 --> 27:44.901
Norland!

27:52.074 --> 27:54.660
Norland. Fuck, Norland.

27:54.827 --> 27:55.995
What, Sam?

27:56.037 --> 27:57.094
Medic!

27:57.120 --> 28:00.817
Medic!
Please, here.

28:01.209 --> 28:03.503
Please, what's the damage?

28:04.629 --> 28:06.298
They hit us with RPGs.

28:06.381 --> 28:08.717
- Let me take a look at you.
- No.

28:09.551 --> 28:11.595
You're gonna be okay.
Hold on.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.597
I don't think I'm going to make it.

28:14.306 --> 28:16.016
Best to leave this in.

28:17.309 --> 28:19.907
Amirev is inside the bubble.

28:19.933 --> 28:21.880
He's safe. For now.

29:08.487 --> 29:10.405
Sir, this is Marshall Geller at Comms Tech.

29:10.447 --> 29:11.949
- Hey, Marshall.
- Sir.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.203
How is the President?

29:16.370 --> 29:18.581
...any background information, anything you know.

29:18.622 --> 29:19.749
He's good.

29:25.879 --> 29:29.049
White House situation room, you're on.
Ready, sir.

29:29.258 --> 29:30.676
This is Sam Keenan.

29:31.510 --> 29:34.763
I regret to inform you that Ambassador Norland has been...

29:34.805 --> 29:36.390
<i>killed in the Embassy attack.</i>

29:36.474 --> 29:38.851
Richard Hammond, Secretary of State.

29:38.935 --> 29:40.812
Our sympathies, Commander Keenan.

29:40.838 --> 29:42.088
How did this happen?

29:42.480 --> 29:43.773
<i>A coup d'etat is in progress.</i>

29:43.815 --> 29:46.943
Amirev is in the Embassy and we've been hit with an RPG.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.070
John Franklin, NSA.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.739
<i>How is your security?</i>

29:50.822 --> 29:53.522
We are surrounded by militia loyal to Kirilov.

29:53.548 --> 29:54.351
I need backup.

29:54.409 --> 29:55.743
<i>This is General Anderson.</i>

29:55.826 --> 29:57.829
Our nearest Marine Expeditionary Unit...

29:57.912 --> 30:00.832
<i>is about six hours due east of your current position.</i>

30:00.873 --> 30:02.917
You folks are just gonna have to do whatever you can...

30:03.001 --> 30:05.170
to hold the fort until they can arrive.

30:05.253 --> 30:06.338
Understood.

30:07.214 --> 30:09.800
And if you don't mind sir, on the double.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.343
Copy that.

30:11.426 --> 30:12.594
<i>Commander Keenan...</i>

30:12.678 --> 30:14.972
we'll keep the lines open for you here at State...

30:15.055 --> 30:17.057
the Pentagon and Ops Center CIA.

30:17.141 --> 30:21.395
Let us know immediately if there's any change in your plans, or your situation.

30:21.479 --> 30:22.647
Good luck.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.943
This is General Anderson.

30:27.234 --> 30:30.654
I'm issuing orders for the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.

30:30.696 --> 30:34.408
To proceed with an emergency Embassy Reinforcement Mission.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.668
O'Brien, check the message.

Message relayed.

30:59.475 --> 31:00.667
<i>This is Fort Victory.</i>

31:00.693 --> 31:02.962
<i>Message received and understood, over.</i>

31:05.732 --> 31:06.356
Go, go, go!

31:06.382 --> 31:07.968
Move, move, move!
Scramble!

31:08.026 --> 31:09.903
Move your ass!
Move your ass!

31:13.949 --> 31:15.492
<i>We're ready to go.</i>

31:24.460 --> 31:26.129
<i>Delta 11, ready.</i>

31:27.463 --> 31:29.924
<i>The birds are in the air.</i>

31:31.009 --> 31:33.135
<i>Delta 13, birds are flying.</i>

31:34.386 --> 31:35.259
<i>All right, boys.</i>

31:35.285 --> 31:37.248
<i>Sit tight, you've got a long ride.</i>

31:42.687 --> 31:45.857
Raise your hand if you feel confident about our security.

31:49.444 --> 31:51.988
What we do have is an E&E plan.

31:52.072 --> 31:54.741
You heard my discussion with the Secretary of State.

31:54.825 --> 31:55.951
Case closed.

31:56.034 --> 31:58.745
Evacuation is our only option.

31:58.954 --> 32:01.123
The longer we delay the harder it'll become.

32:01.206 --> 32:04.083
The evacuation plan was designed for a staff of 15.

32:04.292 --> 32:05.835
We have over 50 people here.

32:05.919 --> 32:07.754
And a full on siege outside.

32:07.837 --> 32:10.966
How long do we have until General Borgov returns with his troops?

32:11.049 --> 32:12.259
About four hours.

32:12.342 --> 32:14.928
By then we'll have militia trying on our pants for size.

32:14.970 --> 32:19.225
Ambassador Norland said he would not let this fragile democracy fail.

32:20.392 --> 32:22.395
I'm not going to let him down.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.230
We hold the fort.

32:25.231 --> 32:27.942
I hate to piss on your little parade, Keenan...

32:28.151 --> 32:29.694
but Norland is dead.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.696
Jesus, am I the only one here...

32:31.780 --> 32:34.115
who thinks life would be rosier on the other side of that mob?

32:34.157 --> 32:35.951
Evac is not an option.

32:36.326 --> 32:39.203
Vietnam is history, pal, get over it.

32:39.286 --> 32:41.163
Frank, you're not being helpful.

32:41.247 --> 32:43.458
Helpful is not sacrificing more American lives...

32:43.499 --> 32:45.460
in a hopeless situation, John.

32:45.501 --> 32:48.129
This guy has been in country less than a day.

32:48.505 --> 32:50.006
What does he know?

32:51.591 --> 32:54.386
<i>Sir, you'd better come to the TCU.</i>

32:55.679 --> 32:56.763
On my way.

33:13.322 --> 33:15.574
- They broke in on Channel 4.
- How?

33:15.783 --> 33:17.340
Don't know, he won't talk to me.

33:17.366 --> 33:19.019
He just wants the man in charge.

33:26.335 --> 33:28.129
This is Sam Keenan. Over.

33:28.296 --> 33:32.217
I said I only want to speak to man in charge.
The Ambassador.

33:32.467 --> 33:35.428
He was killed. I'm in charge.

33:37.222 --> 33:38.765
My name is Tavarov.

33:39.391 --> 33:42.101
I represent the Revolutionary People's Government.

33:42.185 --> 33:44.979
We demand the release of President Yuri Amirev.

33:45.063 --> 33:48.483
To stand a trial for the murder of innocent civilians.

33:48.817 --> 33:52.279
Gunned down on his order outside the palace.

33:52.362 --> 33:53.363
<i>Over.</i>

33:53.446 --> 33:56.199
Amirev is under our protection, which is US soil.

33:56.408 --> 34:00.370
If he did commit those crimes, there are proper and legal ways to proceed.

34:00.412 --> 34:01.996
Not at the point of a gun.

34:02.022 --> 34:04.275
That's how it works in a democracy.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.334
<i>Over.</i>

34:08.879 --> 34:12.675
We have demanded the release of President Amirev.

34:17.012 --> 34:18.722
Look outside, Mr. Keenan.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.683
<i>In front of your gate.</i>

34:21.016 --> 34:23.518
Shit. The roof.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.069
You got a minute, John?

34:35.114 --> 34:37.409
Why did the Vietnam reference get him so riled?

34:37.449 --> 34:38.743
He was born there.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.788
His mother was part of the French Diplomatic Mission.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.041
His old man was some jarhead officer...

34:44.123 --> 34:46.167
who bought a bullet when we pulled out of Saigon.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.222
No wonder he's not big on evac.

34:48.248 --> 34:50.155
No. But he's big on ego.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.757
This guy is a loose cannon.

34:52.966 --> 34:56.344
<i>We just went from George Norland to George of the Jungle.</i>

34:59.264 --> 35:01.225
I'm going back channel on this.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.019
You might consider doing the same thing.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.273
If you wanna save this place and everybody in it.

35:31.381 --> 35:32.882
Out! Get out!

35:35.343 --> 35:36.553
Get out!

35:48.232 --> 35:51.276
Redwood Two, we got three hostages including one woman...

35:51.359 --> 35:53.236
being held at gunpoint. Over.

36:25.061 --> 36:27.813
Yeah, that's General Illienev.

36:29.690 --> 36:31.484
Other guy looks like press.

36:31.776 --> 36:34.737
- And that woman.
- Michelle.

36:34.821 --> 36:37.240
- Michelle Whitman.
- Of course it is.

36:37.365 --> 36:39.034
- United World News.
- Yeah.

36:40.952 --> 36:43.705
Mr. Tavarov, if we are going to talk...

36:44.414 --> 36:46.542
release the hostages now.

36:47.001 --> 36:48.669
Our demands are clear.

36:48.961 --> 36:52.548
Release President Amirev into our custody.

36:53.049 --> 36:56.718
Or these people will be executed.

36:56.968 --> 37:00.597
Can I remind you, the Geneva Convention, about prisoners of war?

37:01.265 --> 37:04.643
Unless I am mistaken, we are not at war.

37:04.768 --> 37:07.229
The hostages are innocent civilians.

37:07.313 --> 37:09.106
Then release our President.

37:10.608 --> 37:12.109
It's very simple.

37:12.401 --> 37:14.487
He's not fucking around.

37:15.613 --> 37:18.741
Our position on that is clear, Mr. Tavarov.

37:19.117 --> 37:20.118
Over.

38:01.910 --> 38:03.620
You have 15 minutes.

38:03.662 --> 38:06.165
Then we will kill them both.

38:06.206 --> 38:08.341
<i>Then you are next, Mr. Keenan.</i>

38:08.367 --> 38:11.070
<i>You and everyone inside the Embassy.</i>

38:11.254 --> 38:13.552
<i>We are taking our country back.</i>

38:13.578 --> 38:15.950
<i>How we do it, it is up to you.</i>

38:24.351 --> 38:25.769
We have no choice.

38:26.561 --> 38:28.188
You read my mind, sir.

38:28.564 --> 38:31.608
I'm going to have to park those thoughts about Beyoncé.

38:32.150 --> 38:33.860
What are you thinking, Keenan?

38:33.886 --> 38:36.221
We're going out there for a rescue.

38:36.529 --> 38:38.198
Gunny, what have we got?

38:38.365 --> 38:41.076
We got two Recon Marines, two trained snipers.

38:41.701 --> 38:44.955
If we can create a diversion, we can get those hostages back.

38:45.163 --> 38:46.854
You don't have anything big enough.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.859
You're right. Two men in the field.

38:49.543 --> 38:51.629
The best they can do is to draw fire.

38:51.712 --> 38:54.173
I know it hurts to agree with me, but let me finish.

38:54.215 --> 38:57.802
You don't have anything big enough, but I do.

38:58.386 --> 39:02.348
A little insurance policy I've been hiding by the name of Charlie Four.

39:05.893 --> 39:08.854
<i>Tiger One, this is Redwood One. Come in.</i>

39:08.938 --> 39:10.856
Tiger One. Over.

39:10.898 --> 39:12.429
<i>- What's your location?</i>

39:12.455 --> 39:13.718
<i>- Baktiar Street.</i>

39:14.694 --> 39:15.639
Are you mobile?

39:15.665 --> 39:17.680
Just four legs between us.

39:20.575 --> 39:21.618
Okay, gentlemen.

39:21.701 --> 39:26.289
<i>There is a bicycle store on Plechia Street, which is two blocks east.</i>

39:26.415 --> 39:27.874
Okay, we'll find it.

39:27.958 --> 39:30.067
The owner is gonna ask your name.

39:30.093 --> 39:31.945
Tell him, "Michael Jordan."

39:32.004 --> 39:34.715
Call us when you're inside, and guys, haul ass.

39:36.091 --> 39:37.634
Okay, let's move.

40:00.616 --> 40:01.618
Sir...

40:02.994 --> 40:06.206
a man calling himself Tavarov just killed a hostage.

40:06.289 --> 40:09.834
More hostages will be killed unless I turn you over.

40:11.794 --> 40:14.046
- I need a straight answer.
- Please.

40:14.380 --> 40:17.258
Did you order your guards to shoot at the people at your palace?

40:17.342 --> 40:20.220
No. Let me explain something.

40:21.096 --> 40:22.597
These men are brutal.

40:23.265 --> 40:25.642
We fought against them, 10 years.

40:25.725 --> 40:27.769
<i>Suffered their abuses for more than 20.</i>

40:27.853 --> 40:31.565
If I thought surrendering myself to them would stop the bloodshed...

40:31.940 --> 40:33.150
I would do it.

40:34.568 --> 40:36.278
But the opposite is true.

40:36.946 --> 40:40.032
Only by defying them can I protect my people.

40:40.700 --> 40:43.785
I'm very sorry you're caught in the middle, Mr. Keenan.

40:44.161 --> 40:47.080
Whatever you decide, I will understand.

40:48.165 --> 40:50.459
- Thank you.
- My army is coming.

41:21.282 --> 41:25.662
<i>This is General Borgov's 18th battalion en route to the American Embassy.</i>

41:25.829 --> 41:28.622
<i>Our ETA will be in four hours.</i>

41:28.648 --> 41:29.858
<i>Do you copy?</i>

41:33.462 --> 41:38.092
<i>This is General Borgov's 18th battalion en route to the American Embassy.</i>

41:38.676 --> 41:42.180
<i>Our ETA will be four hours.
 Over.</i>

41:57.653 --> 41:59.947
Hi, Michael Jordan.

42:01.240 --> 42:04.369
- Good to meet you. Follow me.
- Okay.

42:06.413 --> 42:07.872
You got the radio?

42:09.833 --> 42:11.501
Here's the C4.

42:11.918 --> 42:13.226
Great, thanks.

42:13.252 --> 42:14.279
All right.

42:15.339 --> 42:16.220
Watch our backs.

42:16.246 --> 42:18.449
You squawk twice if there's a problem.

42:18.508 --> 42:21.386
If we're being followed, you're found, whatever.

42:21.845 --> 42:23.722
- Understand.
- Okay.

42:23.763 --> 42:25.891
Let's get this thing on the road.

42:59.467 --> 43:01.010
<i>Bike is in position.</i>

43:20.072 --> 43:22.074
Tiger One.
All set. Over.

43:22.158 --> 43:23.241
<i>Redwood One.</i>

43:23.324 --> 43:24.576
Copy.
All set.

43:24.743 --> 43:26.161
On my command.

43:26.494 --> 43:30.248
Three, two, one, go.

43:34.169 --> 43:35.796
Cover! Cover!

43:47.934 --> 43:49.227
Move!

43:50.019 --> 43:51.312
Go, go, go!

43:54.566 --> 43:56.651
Go, go!
Get the hostages!

43:56.677 --> 43:57.510
Get down!

44:00.196 --> 44:01.489
Move out!

44:05.827 --> 44:07.245
Quick, move!

44:11.708 --> 44:13.835
Come on, guys!
Let's go!

44:17.339 --> 44:18.192
Hustle!

44:18.218 --> 44:19.376
Man down!

44:19.402 --> 44:20.559
Come on!

44:21.051 --> 44:22.928
Get him up. Come on.

44:23.471 --> 44:25.487
Let's move them out, come on!

44:25.513 --> 44:26.624
Let's move it!

44:28.725 --> 44:30.143
Come on, hurry up!

44:34.273 --> 44:35.524
Quick!

44:36.775 --> 44:40.321
Here! Need some help here!

44:40.696 --> 44:42.281
- Medic!
- Medic!

44:43.074 --> 44:44.951
There's a man still out there, sir.

44:50.206 --> 44:51.249
Sir.

45:10.602 --> 45:12.354
Come on, Mateo, let's go.

45:48.933 --> 45:51.144
Come on.
I think we can make it back.

45:54.648 --> 45:55.816
Close the door.

46:22.801 --> 46:24.686
Get the medics in reception.

46:24.712 --> 46:25.788
We got injured.

46:28.140 --> 46:30.226
- You all right, sir?
- Oh, God, my leg.

46:31.185 --> 46:33.229
- You'll be fine.
- I need morphine.

46:38.359 --> 46:38.995
Are you okay?

46:39.021 --> 46:40.636
Take it easy, take it easy.

46:41.070 --> 46:43.572
- Baldwin, get the medics.
- Sir.

46:43.656 --> 46:45.032
And secure the compound.

46:45.116 --> 46:46.951
- Keep on holding, Mateo.
- Move!

46:47.035 --> 46:48.453
Suck it up.

46:49.078 --> 46:50.747
It's great to have you back barking orders...

46:50.830 --> 46:52.916
but we need intel faster than they need a Band-Aid.

46:52.999 --> 46:55.335
- You two are reporters, right?
- Yeah.

46:55.544 --> 46:57.629
How many troops did they bring to the palace?

46:57.712 --> 47:00.007
Fifty, a hundred, I have no idea.

47:00.090 --> 47:04.428
We were filming and then they came after us and we just ran.

47:04.511 --> 47:05.971
And the rest of the Civic Guard?

47:06.055 --> 47:10.475
There were these men arriving in trucks carrying AK-47 s and they fired at them.

47:10.558 --> 47:11.877
You recognize firearms?

47:11.903 --> 47:13.795
Research is part of my job.

47:13.854 --> 47:15.689
Okay, good.
What other equipment did you see?

47:15.772 --> 47:17.316
- Did they have tanks?
- No tanks.

47:17.399 --> 47:18.463
Any heavy armory?

47:18.489 --> 47:20.302
No. We just saw trucks.

47:20.444 --> 47:22.476
What about the leader, Tavarov?

47:22.502 --> 47:24.139
Did he try to hurt you?

47:24.824 --> 47:26.784
Did he say he planned to shoot you?

47:26.867 --> 47:27.925
No. The opposite.

47:27.951 --> 47:30.563
He said he would be happy to release us.

47:35.251 --> 47:39.548
I want to see both of you in my office when you're finished.

47:39.839 --> 47:41.049
Gunny.

47:51.559 --> 47:53.812
What's General Borgov's position?

47:53.895 --> 47:55.939
He's still 120 miles away.

47:56.606 --> 47:59.818
With heavy armor, I'd say, three and a half hours.

47:59.901 --> 48:01.987
They're still mopping up the dead out there.

48:02.112 --> 48:05.407
Corporal Chevanton puts their casualties at 25 dead, 12 wounded.

48:05.491 --> 48:07.034
That will not stop Tavarov.

48:07.117 --> 48:08.975
No, he'll know help is on its way.

48:09.001 --> 48:11.022
It's just going to speed things up.

48:11.664 --> 48:14.207
He'll hit us with everything they've got.

48:15.125 --> 48:17.169
Unless we give them what they want.

48:17.252 --> 48:18.712
- Gunny?
- Sure.

48:19.505 --> 48:21.058
I'll give them what they want.

48:21.084 --> 48:22.533
So long as they want hell.

48:24.844 --> 48:27.305
Marine's balls for frigging brains.

48:27.388 --> 48:30.224
Hey, we got the hostages back, didn't we?

48:35.355 --> 48:36.606
Keenan.

48:38.483 --> 48:41.194
Your mandate here is not to turn this into the Alamo.

48:41.278 --> 48:42.654
Great movie.

48:42.821 --> 48:45.115
Sure. But everybody died.

48:45.824 --> 48:48.117
We got Texas, didn't we?

48:53.331 --> 48:55.292
Sir, we've got movement.

49:00.547 --> 49:02.883
Yes, we have all that under control now.
Yeah.

49:02.966 --> 49:03.926
Can you guys...

49:12.143 --> 49:13.394
Incoming!

49:22.486 --> 49:23.791
<i>Post Five has been hit.</i>

49:23.817 --> 49:25.347
<i>They got the comms array.</i>

49:31.662 --> 49:32.626
The comms are out.

49:32.652 --> 49:34.524
We need to update Washington.

49:34.624 --> 49:36.192
See if they can give us something else.

49:36.218 --> 49:36.835
Come on, move.

49:36.876 --> 49:39.754
- I'll have to rig the Satphone.
- Let's go.

49:54.936 --> 49:56.438
Just be a minute.

50:08.909 --> 50:10.286
Got a lock.

50:10.828 --> 50:12.538
Washington.
Do you copy? Over.

50:12.705 --> 50:14.874
<i>This is General Anderson. Copy that.</i>

50:14.999 --> 50:17.877
Yeah. Patch me through to the Secretary of State.

50:18.002 --> 50:19.587
<i>This is Secretary Hammond.</i>

50:19.671 --> 50:22.132
What is your current situation? Over.

50:22.215 --> 50:25.217
Sir, militia forces destroyed our communication center.

50:25.301 --> 50:27.636
Sir, Mr. Secretary, this is Frank Gaines, CIA.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.889
We are outnumbered by over 20 to 1 at the moment.

50:29.931 --> 50:31.724
We have no cover on three sides...

50:31.808 --> 50:34.602
and the militia may have seized government tanks and heavy weapons.

50:34.686 --> 50:37.981
- Yeah, but...
- Sir, with relief forces still hours away...

50:38.064 --> 50:40.317
and General Borgov's army out of contact...

50:40.400 --> 50:43.361
I strongly urge that we reconsider the plan to evacuate...

50:43.445 --> 50:45.364
and take advantage of imminent night cover.

50:45.447 --> 50:47.741
That's an opinion which I cannot support, sir.

50:47.783 --> 50:51.036
Would you stand by for a moment, Commander Keenan?

50:55.832 --> 50:58.793
Sir, I think you should take a look at this.

51:03.882 --> 51:06.343
Gentlemen, we have a problem here.

51:07.303 --> 51:08.596
Commander Keenan.

51:08.637 --> 51:11.807
<i>This department has not received official notification...</i>

51:11.891 --> 51:16.354
that you've replaced Captain Baldwin as acting Deputy Chief of Mission. Over.

51:16.437 --> 51:17.814
I'm not getting you, sir.

51:17.897 --> 51:20.567
<i>The cable replacing Captain Baldwin...</i>

51:20.650 --> 51:23.236
<i>as acting Deputy Chief of Mission was never sent.</i>

51:23.486 --> 51:26.114
Officially, he is in charge, not you.

51:26.740 --> 51:29.116
I am hereby ordering you to assist him...

51:29.367 --> 51:30.701
<i>in any way you can.</i>

51:30.826 --> 51:33.705
<i>Could you put Captain Baldwin on the line?</i>

51:34.330 --> 51:35.915
This is Captain Baldwin.

51:35.999 --> 51:38.501
What is your assessment of the merits of an E&E?

51:38.585 --> 51:42.172
I cannot guarantee the safety of anyone in this facility.

51:42.339 --> 51:46.051
I would therefore agree that evacuation would be advisable.

51:47.469 --> 51:50.806
Captain Baldwin, you are authorized to proceed.

51:54.810 --> 51:58.606
<i>This is Delta 13, we are en route and ETA is three hours. Over.</i>

52:38.188 --> 52:40.231
I heard the staff talking.

52:41.483 --> 52:44.528
- And?
- They say we're moving out.

52:44.945 --> 52:46.363
Is that so?

52:46.905 --> 52:48.657
Sam, if we stay, we're dead.

52:48.740 --> 52:51.160
If we go, we're ducks in a shooting gallery.

52:51.243 --> 52:53.037
Well, it's Baldwin's call now.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.498
Michelle, Baldwin is a good guy.

52:55.623 --> 52:57.959
But he's never been in a combat situation.

52:58.042 --> 52:59.502
But this is his turf.

53:01.087 --> 53:02.755
This is your life.

53:03.214 --> 53:05.716
Does it ever occur to you that you might be wrong?

53:05.799 --> 53:07.342
Not this time.

53:07.760 --> 53:11.806
You know, it's okay to run when you have explored all the options.

53:15.726 --> 53:17.395
We'll talk about this later.

53:24.235 --> 53:25.570
I tried to warn you.

53:25.654 --> 53:28.573
We don't have time to build a horse or dig a tunnel.

53:28.657 --> 53:29.776
We don't have to.

53:29.802 --> 53:31.184
Someone already did.

53:31.243 --> 53:32.619
Talk to me.

53:41.461 --> 53:44.130
Now, here's a little something for you.

53:44.965 --> 53:46.007
What is it?

53:46.091 --> 53:49.595
Paranoid bastards built all kinds of shit under the city.

53:49.678 --> 53:51.930
Bomb shelters, command posts.

53:52.181 --> 53:54.808
More tunnels than the New York subway.

53:55.810 --> 53:57.269
That's lucky for us.

53:57.311 --> 53:58.396
All stations.

53:58.521 --> 53:59.939
<i>Harry is open. Over.</i>

54:00.940 --> 54:02.270
Birch One to all staff.

54:02.296 --> 54:03.509
Initiate final burn.

54:08.448 --> 54:10.737
Just the sensitive stuff. Bag it all.

54:10.763 --> 54:12.309
Burn it to the furnace.

54:19.709 --> 54:20.765
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

54:20.791 --> 54:22.946
<i>Please make your way to the first floor lobby...</i>

54:23.004 --> 54:24.262
<i>and prepare for immediate evacuation.</i>

54:24.288 --> 54:25.757
<i>And then they told me the situation...</i>

54:25.757 --> 54:27.133
All quiet up here.

54:32.639 --> 54:33.765
Stop there.

54:43.024 --> 54:43.875
Tiger One.

54:43.901 --> 54:45.177
Transport ETA.

54:46.236 --> 54:48.196
Tiger Two, ready. Out.

55:00.543 --> 55:03.755
Tiger One, tunnel exit located and secure. Over.

55:11.096 --> 55:12.264
Just keep it moving.

55:14.390 --> 55:17.768
Hey, folks, about a quarter mile till we reach open air.

55:17.852 --> 55:19.228
Stay tight.

55:25.902 --> 55:27.112
Come on, let's go.

55:27.195 --> 55:29.656
Look, I'll give you the details of the evac plan...

55:29.739 --> 55:32.409
when we're on the bus and out of the city.

55:32.492 --> 55:35.454
So, if you could just take your place in line.

55:35.537 --> 55:36.997
I'm staying.

55:37.539 --> 55:41.377
That would be contradicting a direct order from the Secretary of State.

55:41.502 --> 55:44.839
Tavarov will want a point of contact inside the embassy.

55:44.922 --> 55:46.042
Let it go, Keenan.

55:46.068 --> 55:48.992
Face it, pal, you just weren't up to the job.

55:49.259 --> 55:53.180
<i>Redwood Two.
 The men are briefed for a tactical withdrawal. Out.</i>

55:53.263 --> 55:54.390
Birch One. Copy that.

55:57.601 --> 55:59.061
Suit yourself, tough guy.

56:03.149 --> 56:04.901
It'll be all right.

56:04.984 --> 56:06.277
This way.

56:07.237 --> 56:09.990
There are two more coming through. Over.

56:16.538 --> 56:18.915
Tavarov's men are still gathering out front.

56:19.040 --> 56:21.751
Right. By the time he's inside, we'll have a half-hour head start.

56:21.793 --> 56:24.546
I'll just divert the Marine Expeditionary Units to the new away point...

56:24.587 --> 56:27.257
and then we chopper out the civilians. Simple.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.552
You made the right decision.

56:32.095 --> 56:33.263
Yeah.

56:37.393 --> 56:40.062
Redwood Two.
Clarify status, Tiger One. Over.

56:48.780 --> 56:49.864
Sir.

56:59.332 --> 57:01.584
This way. 
Keep moving, please.

57:25.567 --> 57:27.610
If you boys go AWOL again...

57:29.196 --> 57:30.697
I'm gonna kick your ass.

57:30.781 --> 57:35.035
Yeah, you get stuck in a hole again, I ain't gonna save your sorry ass.

57:35.118 --> 57:36.453
Follow me.

57:36.662 --> 57:37.913
Let's go.

57:42.835 --> 57:45.379
Redwood Two.
Clarify status, Tiger One. Over.

57:45.463 --> 57:47.340
<i>Tiger One. Hatch is open. Over.</i>

57:57.141 --> 57:58.392
Come on.

58:07.235 --> 58:08.319
There it is.

58:08.695 --> 58:11.531
Redwood Two.
Go, go, go. Stay low, stay low.

58:12.198 --> 58:14.284
All right, let's get up there and cover.

58:17.245 --> 58:18.497
Come on.

58:19.915 --> 58:21.875
Nice work.
Let's get them on the bus.

58:38.976 --> 58:40.227
Go, go.

58:56.912 --> 58:58.246
Redwood Two.
Clarify status...

58:58.330 --> 58:59.280
<i>Tiger One. Over.</i>

58:59.306 --> 59:00.706
<i>Almost there, sir.</i>

59:00.748 --> 59:01.843
<i>This is Birch One.</i>

59:01.869 --> 59:03.693
<i>President is en route. Over.</i>

59:04.627 --> 59:07.088
Why don't you attack this Embassy?

59:09.132 --> 59:10.842
What are you waiting for?

59:28.069 --> 59:29.570
Okay. Holding.

59:32.364 --> 59:34.116
Better, better way.

59:42.500 --> 59:43.793
It's not right.

59:48.339 --> 59:49.465
Shit!

59:50.967 --> 59:52.343
What are you doing?

59:55.513 --> 59:56.473
Shit.

Retreat!
All back to the Embassy. Go!

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.403
Michelle!

01:00:10.528 --> 01:00:11.821
Move out!

01:00:13.949 --> 01:00:14.903
We've been set up.

01:00:14.929 --> 01:00:15.934
We've been set up!

01:00:15.992 --> 01:00:17.327

Get them out of here!

01:00:34.095 --> 01:00:35.555
Move! Go, go!

01:00:35.638 --> 01:00:37.723
- Sir, they knew we were coming.
- Come on.

01:00:51.154 --> 01:00:52.864
Let's move inside.

01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:04.501
Back inside.

01:01:04.585 --> 01:01:06.044
Go. Let's go!

01:01:06.879 --> 01:01:08.213
Move, move, move!

01:01:12.425 --> 01:01:13.927
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:01:20.934 --> 01:01:23.812
Get the people to the TCU and the President to the ACR.

01:01:23.896 --> 01:01:25.648
- Now. Come on, move.
- Let's go.

01:01:30.194 --> 01:01:31.362
Where's Michelle?

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.648
Where's Michelle?

01:01:33.674 --> 01:01:35.767
She's still in the tunnel, I think.

01:01:36.618 --> 01:01:37.267
Keenan, don't.

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:37.962
It's too late.

01:01:37.988 --> 01:01:39.145
Leave it, they're gone.

01:01:39.204 --> 01:01:41.539
I want this Embassy combat ready in 15 minutes.

01:01:41.622 --> 01:01:43.833
You're not in command anymore!

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:46.043
We're talking about lives here.

01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:51.841
- Give me five minutes, then seal the tunnel.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:51.924 --> 01:01:53.259
Don't wait for me.

01:02:25.918 --> 01:02:27.086
Michelle.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.345
Sam.

01:02:37.972 --> 01:02:39.182
Stay down.

01:03:29.275 --> 01:03:30.901
I'll take you out of here.

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.308
- Seal the tunnel.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:02.768 --> 01:04:03.977
Fire in the hole!

01:04:11.902 --> 01:04:13.404
Geller is dead.

01:04:13.946 --> 01:04:16.741
The Satphone's out. We're cut off.

01:04:19.952 --> 01:04:22.830
They knew we were coming.
They had to.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.781
Did we scan everybody?

01:04:29.807 --> 01:04:32.448
Everyone who passes the security post.

01:04:32.715 --> 01:04:34.467
But it wasn't manned.

01:04:39.013 --> 01:04:41.266
<i>Amirev. He's still alive, sir.</i>

01:04:49.942 --> 01:04:51.995
<i>This is Delta 13, we are en route.</i>

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.470
<i>ETA is one hour. Over.</i>

01:05:24.352 --> 01:05:26.146
- Mr. President.
- Sir.

01:05:26.646 --> 01:05:30.107
We believe the militia may have planted a listening device on someone.

01:05:30.149 --> 01:05:33.402
They made sure it was someone who made it inside.

01:05:34.111 --> 01:05:35.571
Check my men, please.

01:05:47.793 --> 01:05:49.002
Clean.

01:05:49.044 --> 01:05:50.128
Sir, is there any chance...

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:52.840
that someone in your office could have planted one on you?

01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:55.676
Anything is possible.

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:57.386
- Do you mind?
- Please.

01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:13.611
Nothing.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.197
So, that's everyone.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.783
No. Not everyone.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.984
Deactivated.
It's one of ours.

01:06:52.985 --> 01:06:56.280
Tavarov has heard everything within 10 feet of you.

01:07:15.925 --> 01:07:17.551
How's your head?

01:07:18.803 --> 01:07:20.430
Mild concussion.

01:07:22.265 --> 01:07:23.725
Sam, I...

01:07:26.561 --> 01:07:30.148
Sometimes, life forces you to make a tough call, Michelle.

01:07:31.733 --> 01:07:33.360
But those people...

01:07:34.653 --> 01:07:35.737
Those poor people.

01:07:37.655 --> 01:07:38.740
I know.

01:07:39.741 --> 01:07:41.284
That's history.

01:07:42.535 --> 01:07:45.330
Maybe it sounds cold, but that's history.

01:07:46.832 --> 01:07:49.751
You have to survive to write about it, okay?

01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:53.464
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

01:07:59.386 --> 01:08:03.266
Michelle, they'll come at us with everything they've got.

01:08:04.642 --> 01:08:06.561
I need to handle this.

01:08:12.816 --> 01:08:14.568
Eight marines left.

01:08:15.361 --> 01:08:16.559
How's the morale holding up?

01:08:16.585 --> 01:08:18.613
We've got 10 motivated bad-asses, Gunny...

01:08:18.656 --> 01:08:22.160
just itching to bring a world of pain to these motherfuckers.

01:08:22.243 --> 01:08:23.661
Copy that.

01:08:23.828 --> 01:08:25.474
Time to get down and dirty.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.997
Keenan wants claymores.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.899
You get a staffer to pass these around.

01:08:28.925 --> 01:08:29.734
I want metal...

01:08:29.834 --> 01:08:33.755
keys, coins, knives, nails and I want them back here, full, in five minutes.

01:08:33.839 --> 01:08:35.090
Yes, sir.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.720
You were looking for me?

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.225
Sir, I feel I should be relieved of my command.

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.895
Officially I don't work here, remember?

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:51.189
We've got Tavarov.
On four.

01:08:52.482 --> 01:08:53.258
You take it.

01:08:53.283 --> 01:08:56.386
As far as he and I are concerned you're in charge here.

01:08:58.781 --> 01:09:00.866
<i>- Sam Keenan.
- Mr. Keenan.</i>

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:04.203
You can end this with no further loss on either side.

01:09:04.287 --> 01:09:06.706
Release President Amirev now...

01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:09.501
and your people will leave our country unharmed.

01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:12.504
The marines and a shit load of tanks are heading your way.

01:09:12.587 --> 01:09:13.712
<i>Over.</i>

01:09:14.046 --> 01:09:17.716
When they get here, they will be dealing with a new government.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:18.843
Out.

01:09:20.219 --> 01:09:23.700
Baldwin, are the civilians in the basement?

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:24.832
Yes, sir.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.145
How are we looking?

01:09:31.898 --> 01:09:32.845
Bad news, sir.

01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:34.968
Our perimeter's full of holes.

01:09:35.152 --> 01:09:36.219
And the good news?

01:09:36.245 --> 01:09:37.429
The good news?

01:09:38.488 --> 01:09:41.908
We gonna teach these mothers a whole new meaning of pain.

01:09:41.992 --> 01:09:43.545
Give them hell, Gunny.

01:09:43.571 --> 01:09:44.770
That's an order.

01:09:44.828 --> 01:09:46.122
Yes, sir.

01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:52.085
Happy 4th of July, gentlemen.

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:55.672
I suggest you make full use of the right to bear arms.

01:09:56.632 --> 01:09:59.093
Got to love that Second Amendment.

01:10:21.908 --> 01:10:24.410
- What you doing here?
- Sightseeing.

01:10:25.328 --> 01:10:26.538
Michelle, go to the basement.

01:10:26.621 --> 01:10:29.457
I would, but Mike said he can't find a decent camera angle down there.

01:10:29.499 --> 01:10:32.043
Yeah, that, and the lighting sucks.

01:10:32.544 --> 01:10:35.380
Intelligent, beautiful, stubborn.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:37.925
Nice mix.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.224
<i>Sir, should we wait?</i>

01:10:47.184 --> 01:10:48.769
No. Attack.

01:10:54.942 --> 01:10:56.735
Redwood One to Redwood Two.

01:10:57.736 --> 01:10:59.964
They're positioning to attack.

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.806
Get ready.

01:11:01.615 --> 01:11:02.992
Copy that.

01:11:04.118 --> 01:11:07.288
At code Baker, followed by your number, hold your fire.

01:11:07.538 --> 01:11:09.332
<i>We lure them into the open area...</i>

01:11:09.415 --> 01:11:12.460
<i>at which point I will give them their motherfucking bonus.</i>

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:15.088
<i>And we all open up with everything we've got.
 Over.</i>

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.256
Over.

01:11:19.134 --> 01:11:20.302
Here we go!

01:11:48.372 --> 01:11:49.760
Come on, hurry, hurry.

01:11:49.786 --> 01:11:50.983
This way. Quicker.

01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:54.420
- Go, go.
- Come on, keep moving.

01:11:54.504 --> 01:11:56.505
Come on, move.
Get everyone in the corner over here.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.118
General Borgov is on the secure channel.

01:13:11.541 --> 01:13:14.169
Baker Three, Baker Five, Baker Seven.

01:13:25.472 --> 01:13:26.930
We're getting in deep.

01:13:26.956 --> 01:13:27.750
Stand down.

01:14:01.134 --> 01:14:03.553
<i>Tavarov, this is General Borgov.</i>

01:14:03.637 --> 01:14:06.973
<i>We are nearing your position, and I am ordering you to stand down.</i>

01:14:07.014 --> 01:14:08.641
The Army's back.

01:14:09.642 --> 01:14:11.102
Withdraw now.

01:14:13.188 --> 01:14:14.856
Move back, move back!

01:14:22.948 --> 01:14:26.368
Mr. Keenan. Your cavalry has arrived.

01:14:26.952 --> 01:14:28.370
<i>You are lucky.</i>

01:14:36.546 --> 01:14:37.780
<i>Baker Six, Baker Six.</i>

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.156
<i>There is a cease-fire.</i>

01:14:39.214 --> 01:14:40.682
<i>Militia is falling back.</i>

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:42.910
<i>I repeat, militia is falling back.</i>

01:14:43.052 --> 01:14:44.428
Binoculars.

01:15:05.242 --> 01:15:07.058
General Borgov's regiment.

01:15:07.084 --> 01:15:08.061
They made it.

01:15:18.338 --> 01:15:20.757
Congratulations to your brave marines.

01:15:20.799 --> 01:15:25.012
At last, I can release you of this burden,
and return to the Presidential Palace.

01:15:48.995 --> 01:15:51.622
General Borgov is a personal contact.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:56.961
It would be a great honor, Mr. President, if I could take his report first hand.

01:15:57.003 --> 01:15:58.963
- Very well.
- Thank you.

01:15:59.255 --> 01:16:02.092
John, I sense a juicy photo op coming up.

01:16:05.429 --> 01:16:06.096
Redwood One?

01:16:06.122 --> 01:16:08.790
Tell your girlfriend to get her cameras fired up.

01:16:09.224 --> 01:16:10.267
<i>Over.</i>

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:13.145
Copy that.

01:16:48.931 --> 01:16:51.183
In the nick of time, General.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.902
Good to see you again.

01:16:53.928 --> 01:16:55.880
Thank you for coming, sir.

01:16:57.065 --> 01:16:58.653
This is Birch One.

01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:01.653
Militia forces have cut and run.

01:17:01.695 --> 01:17:03.613
The Government Square is secured.

01:17:03.697 --> 01:17:07.492
Please tell President Amirev his people await his return.

01:17:07.659 --> 01:17:09.036
<i>- Out.
- Yes!</i>

01:17:36.731 --> 01:17:38.024
Oh, shit.

01:17:38.441 --> 01:17:39.472
Redwood Three.

01:17:39.498 --> 01:17:40.969
Return to compound.

01:17:41.236 --> 01:17:42.675
The Army's in on this.

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:44.139
Fall back, fall back!

01:17:44.322 --> 01:17:45.657
Get down!

01:18:07.763 --> 01:18:08.931
Move.

01:18:22.195 --> 01:18:25.113
Get the President back into the bubble.
Now.

01:18:25.447 --> 01:18:26.782
Come on.

01:19:10.619 --> 01:19:12.556
<i>Anaconda Six to US Embassy.</i>

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:14.231
<i>Do you read me?
Over.</i>

01:19:14.748 --> 01:19:16.994
This is Redwood One, say again.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.903
I do not read you.
 Over.

01:19:21.339 --> 01:19:22.281
<i>Anaconda Six.</i>

01:19:22.307 --> 01:19:23.440
<i>Do you read me?</i>

01:19:23.466 --> 01:19:25.493
<i>What's your sit-rep? Over.</i>

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:29.638
We've got tanks in front of the Embassy, pounding the crap out of us.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.724
<i>Copy that.
Will return the favor.</i>

01:19:33.517 --> 01:19:35.937
<i>This is the United States Army.</i>

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:39.899
<i>Stand down, lower your weapons, or you will be fired upon.</i>

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:50.786
Go.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:05.050
Here.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.413
I'm out.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.123
Get out of here!

01:20:36.374 --> 01:20:37.375
Sir.

01:21:21.754 --> 01:21:23.005
Where's Sam?

01:21:44.861 --> 01:21:46.696
Don't think about it.

01:21:47.322 --> 01:21:48.490
Do it.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.802
- Seal this room, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:07.885 --> 01:22:10.429
- Keep everybody over the other side, now.
- Okay.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.586
Sir, Miss Whitman's not in the TCU.

01:23:38.228 --> 01:23:39.354
Here!

01:25:18.206 --> 01:25:20.459
Private, bring that stretcher.

01:25:21.001 --> 01:25:22.210
Move!

01:25:25.046 --> 01:25:26.339
Medic!

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.348
Come on.

01:25:39.102 --> 01:25:41.021
We need some help here.

01:25:49.905 --> 01:25:51.282
Thank you.

01:25:52.533 --> 01:25:54.327
Right this way, sir.

01:25:59.498 --> 01:26:02.334
- Marine, who's in charge here?
- He is, sir.

01:26:08.758 --> 01:26:11.344
Commander Keenan.
 Sit, sir, sit.

01:26:12.053 --> 01:26:14.305
Let's get these civilians out of here.

01:26:14.389 --> 01:26:15.446
Go for it, Colonel.

01:26:15.472 --> 01:26:17.250
Aren't you coming with us?

01:26:17.934 --> 01:26:19.102
That's a no.

01:26:19.185 --> 01:26:20.896
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.319
I'm not going anywhere.

01:26:35.994 --> 01:26:37.078
