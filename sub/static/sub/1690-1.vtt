Oh, shit. Darcy, you really
shouldn't have come.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.327
Show me.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.419
Corporate was adamant.
We keep running.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.338
No stopping operations.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.508
No, no, no. You got to go through.
No cameras.

02:53.925 --> 02:54.926
He's got orders to kill.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.511
I don't even think international
laws apply up here.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.638
We are geologists first.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.516
If this thing has any
historical significance at all,

03:01.599 --> 03:04.060
we are shutting down.
I'm shutting us down.

03:06.271 --> 03:08.398
Oh, he's going to shoot me?
Shoot me.

03:08.690 --> 03:09.691
Hey,
don't kill her.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.443
This is crazy stuff.

03:21.494 --> 03:22.996
Crazy shit.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.920
Well, what do you think?

03:31.880 --> 03:34.007
I think history is
about to change.

04:09.334 --> 04:10.919
<i>I'm a nasty woman</i>

What, surf report no
good at South Padre?

04:27.393 --> 04:30.688
The waves are flat and I got no gas.
You know that, Cade.

04:33.358 --> 04:34.859
Dude. Rude.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.321
Look at these two junebugs.
Whoo! My, my!

04:38.780 --> 04:40.490
Hey, you're paying me on
this one, right, Cade?

04:40.573 --> 04:41.616
Please tell me I'm getting paid.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.202
You know, Lucas, a lot of guys are
just happy to have a job at all.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.536
Yeah, I suppose.

04:45.745 --> 04:46.996
- You got any cash on you?
- Yeah.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.081
All right, good.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.674
Hey, Lucas Flannery.

04:59.384 --> 05:01.678
Place has been
in the family since '28.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.722
Granddaddy ran it all his life.
Ain't that right, Granddaddy?

05:05.348 --> 05:07.684
Real soon he's going
to sign it over to me.

05:07.892 --> 05:10.395
The movies
nowadays, that's the trouble.

05:10.812 --> 05:13.147
Sequels and remakes,
bunch of crap.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.358
I love that one. Oh.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.235
He's deaf and senile.

05:17.443 --> 05:18.486
Heard that.

05:19.070 --> 05:20.822
Now these just need
some spit and polish.

05:20.905 --> 05:23.741
I believe they're
digital, possibly IMAX.

05:23.992 --> 05:24.993
Yeah, they're not.

05:25.076 --> 05:27.328
Mister, we'll have a look around if
you want to leave us to it, okay?

05:27.412 --> 05:29.247
You know, folks used to
come from miles around

05:29.497 --> 05:32.583
to see the dancing girls with
the big cha-chas.

05:32.834 --> 05:33.835
I swear to God

05:33.918 --> 05:35.920
I am one diaper change away
from poisoning his oatmeal.

05:36.212 --> 05:37.463
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.715
If coming here makes
you feel young,

05:38.798 --> 05:40.258
then you tell this kid to
bring you here every day.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.260
Seven bucks, I keep talking.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.386
Sold.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.849
Remember this
place when we were kids?

05:47.932 --> 05:50.601
How many girls you think you
brought here in high school?

05:54.272 --> 05:55.523
I only remember one.

05:57.483 --> 05:58.651
Hey, heads!

06:03.031 --> 06:04.157
Ow!

06:04.907 --> 06:06.784
That's why you didn't
make the varsity team.

06:07.452 --> 06:08.494
Ah.

06:09.078 --> 06:11.414
All right. Go long.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.296
Leave it.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.987
Mortar shells?

06:43.196 --> 06:44.822
What the hell happened to you?

06:45.656 --> 06:48.743
Hey, Snakeballs. How
much for the truck?

06:50.161 --> 06:51.329
Truck?

07:05.676 --> 07:09.013
Two more weeks, girls, till
no more classes, ever.

07:09.347 --> 07:11.849
Almost time to get a
tan and get wasted!

07:41.045 --> 07:42.713
Please, please.

07:46.676 --> 07:49.428
No financial aid. Great.

07:54.684 --> 07:57.436
Yes, I know I'm home, thank you.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.189
<i>Intruder alert! Back
away from the premises!</i>

08:00.523 --> 08:02.942
- Voice recognition. It's me!
<i>- I am dialing 911.</i>

08:03.192 --> 08:05.945
Go right ahead. I don't care.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.030
<i>I'm still calling 911.</i>

08:08.322 --> 08:09.866
<i>The
Battle of Chicago was an event</i>

08:09.949 --> 08:11.659
<i>that permanently
changed our world.</i>

08:11.742 --> 08:12.702
<i>Over 1,300 dead.</i>

08:12.785 --> 08:14.203
<i>Much of the
city has been destroyed.</i>

08:14.287 --> 08:16.289
<i>Homeland
Security is urging everyone</i>

08:16.372 --> 08:18.082
<i>to report suspicious
alien activity.</i>

08:21.085 --> 08:22.211
<i>A
swift act of Congress</i>

08:22.295 --> 08:24.338
<i>put an end to all
joint operations</i>

08:24.422 --> 08:28.342
<i>between the military and the
Autobots, ending the alliance.</i>

08:28.426 --> 08:30.636
<i>As this committee
knows, the Invasion of Chicago</i>

08:30.720 --> 08:33.139
<i>was a defining day for our
nation five years ago.</i>

08:33.597 --> 08:36.142
The day millions of
people realized that

08:36.225 --> 08:39.477
never again can we allow aliens
to fight our battles for us.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.691
A handful of Autobots
were given sanctuary

08:43.774 --> 08:46.736
after joint-combat
operations were abolished.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.280
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons
are still on the run

08:49.906 --> 08:51.324
thanks to our CIA unit,

08:52.325 --> 08:53.618
"Cemetery Wind."

08:54.118 --> 08:55.286
<i>Hurry, let's get
it to my house, guys.</i>

08:55.369 --> 08:56.537
As for the alien technology,

08:56.621 --> 08:58.497
our objective remains to
keep it in American control.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.208
<i>Hi. My name is Timothy.
This is my crew.</i>

09:00.625 --> 09:03.002
<i>We found this alien
ball turret in Chicago.</i>

09:03.127 --> 09:05.338
<i>We just found it in the rubble
and it's all working...</i>

09:05.588 --> 09:07.131
Word has
it Japan, India,

09:07.423 --> 09:10.551
the Israelis may have gotten their
hands on a couple of ships.

09:10.635 --> 09:12.595
Apparently the Russians are
starting a bidding war.

09:12.803 --> 09:16.474
<i>We're taking $5,000 for it.
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.</i>

09:17.475 --> 09:18.935
A new era has begun.

09:19.185 --> 09:22.480
And the age of the
Transformers is over.

09:44.043 --> 09:45.044
Hey.

09:45.503 --> 09:47.630
<i>Hey, I've been waiting for you.</i>

09:49.298 --> 09:50.716
<i>You're looking hot today!</i>

09:50.800 --> 09:52.385
Oh, yeah? How about you
take your shirt off?

09:53.844 --> 09:55.388
<i>You want me to take my
shirt off right now?</i>

09:55.471 --> 09:56.639
<i>What would your dad
think of that?</i>

09:56.722 --> 09:58.057
- What the hell?
<i>- Hey, where you going?</i>

09:58.140 --> 10:00.142
I cannot believe him. I
cannot believe this.

10:02.687 --> 10:04.063
What the hell?

10:04.480 --> 10:05.856
All the way!

10:10.403 --> 10:11.529
A truck?

10:11.612 --> 10:14.490
Dad, please tell me you didn't
spend our money on this.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.158
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't.
He spent my money.

10:16.242 --> 10:17.368
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.203
As an advance on your
regular paycheck.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.622
- What regular paycheck?
- Which you will get back.

10:21.706 --> 10:23.165
- When?
- Never. We're broke.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.417
I knew it.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.377
Sweetheart, could you
please not drive a wedge

10:26.460 --> 10:27.586
between employer and employee.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.422
Hold on. I thought
we were partners.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.632
Look, I came up short, okay? I
had to buy her a prom dress.

10:31.716 --> 10:33.050
You want me to deny
her a prom dress?

10:33.259 --> 10:34.719
You might as well. You
denied her a prom date.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.721
No, I offered to take
her and chaperone.

10:36.971 --> 10:39.598
Nobody wants to go to the dance
with their dad. It's weird.

10:39.890 --> 10:40.891
It's not the issue.

10:41.267 --> 10:42.518
Well, maybe it should be.

10:42.727 --> 10:43.811
Hey, could you guys
just get off my case?

10:44.061 --> 10:45.479
You know what the engine
on this runs for?

10:45.730 --> 10:47.106
I can break it down and
strip it for parts.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.151
And sweetheart, your shorts are
shrinking by the second, okay?

10:50.401 --> 10:51.736
Cold water, air dry, please.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.364
I think she looks hot.

10:55.823 --> 10:56.824
What did you say?

10:57.241 --> 10:58.534
Like a hot teenager.

10:58.784 --> 11:01.245
Oh, it's the "teenager" thing
that makes it better. Thank you.

11:01.329 --> 11:02.663
It didn't sound
like what it meant.

11:07.418 --> 11:08.502
That goes by
the circuit boards.

11:10.171 --> 11:12.131
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.

11:13.341 --> 11:15.718
Dad, please. You can't keep
spending money on junk

11:15.801 --> 11:17.595
just so you can turn it
into different junk.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.430
We do not use the
"J" word in here.

11:19.764 --> 11:22.183
That is a Super Simplex theater projector.
It's very rare.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.185
What about the SmilePilot?

11:24.602 --> 11:27.104
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented?
Simply ahead of their time.

11:27.355 --> 11:29.732
Yeah, like the
alleged Guard-Dawg.

11:31.317 --> 11:32.318
You're gonna get him upset.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.279
Hey, Cade! Cade!

11:35.946 --> 11:36.947
This thing still work?

11:37.281 --> 11:38.282
- No!
- Yes.

11:38.366 --> 11:39.367
Yes, and still groundbreaking.

11:39.617 --> 11:42.620
Go back there and lay on the recliner
and just wait for a cold one.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.501
Dude, stop breaking stuff.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.796
Final notice, late
notice, past due.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.298
Come on, come on.

11:55.466 --> 11:57.134
Bring Daddy the alcohol.
Come on.

11:57.385 --> 11:59.887
I mean, what is all this
crap people send you?

12:00.137 --> 12:01.806
That's a Discman and
that's an 8-track tape.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.725
- Music.
- Never heard of it.

12:06.185 --> 12:08.562
Look, I fix that, it's 100 bucks.
I fix that, it's $250.

12:08.646 --> 12:11.065
If I would have been able to fix
that before you broke it even more,

12:11.148 --> 12:12.149
it would have been 20 bucks.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.484
This stuff is what's gonna
put you through college,

12:13.734 --> 12:15.653
as long as you land one
of those scholarships.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.489
What's the estimated time of
arrival, usually? Average?

12:21.158 --> 12:23.661
Wait. So it just brings
the beer near you?

12:23.869 --> 12:24.870
That's the trick?

12:25.246 --> 12:27.289
- It's got a couple kinks, man.
- Yeah.

12:27.498 --> 12:30.126
Dad, you think maybe some things
should never be invented?

12:30.334 --> 12:31.669
No, I don't. That's
backwards thinking.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.338
This is a temple of technology. You
guys are standing in a holy place.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.259
What do you think? Why don't
you look at all of this?

12:38.342 --> 12:40.302
This could be yours.
What about this land?

12:40.511 --> 12:43.264
Purple People Eater's back
and she looks hungry.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.015
Isn't this incredible?

12:45.266 --> 12:46.684
- I knew you would like it.
- Hey, you!

12:46.892 --> 12:48.060
Hey.

12:48.978 --> 12:50.521
I own this house!
It's not for sale!

12:50.980 --> 12:52.940
Six months late on payments, Mr.
Yeager.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.192
And I see you stealing
power at the pole.

12:55.276 --> 12:56.569
Hey, that's
not your concern.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.654
- Sir, do you wanna see the property?
- Sure.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.406
I'd be more than happy
to give you a tour.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.991
I'll show you three other
buyers I got buried out back,

13:02.074 --> 13:03.534
then I'll crack your
head open like an egg!

13:03.617 --> 13:05.035
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Stay back! He's crazy.

13:05.119 --> 13:06.370
I told you don't come
back here anymore.

13:06.579 --> 13:07.872
I will have my brother come
back and beat your ass!

13:07.955 --> 13:09.498
- Don't you start with me.
- Why don't you do it yourself?

13:09.582 --> 13:10.875
And I'll bring the
police when I come, too!

13:10.958 --> 13:13.169
- My brother ain't no joke!
- Who, Jerry?

13:13.419 --> 13:14.545
You bring his big ass up here,

13:14.628 --> 13:17.131
he's gonna be huffing and puffing
before he can squeeze out of that car!

13:17.381 --> 13:19.550
You back out on my grass,
you're gonna be in big trouble!

13:19.925 --> 13:23.137
You tell Jerry to come see me.
I'll give him some pecan pie.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.639
Hey!

13:28.058 --> 13:30.978
She smashed through the fence?

13:31.061 --> 13:34.064
Cade, relax. You're going to
have an aortic infarction.

13:34.148 --> 13:35.191
What is that?

13:35.274 --> 13:36.901
I think it's a brain
heart attack.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.277
Yeah, I've had one already.

13:38.569 --> 13:39.695
So we're stealing power now?

13:39.778 --> 13:41.322
No, we're borrowing it
from the neighbors.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.491
Great. That's awesome.

13:43.908 --> 13:46.410
Once I graduate and I'm gone,
who's gonna take care of you?

13:46.494 --> 13:47.745
Oh, you take care of me?

13:48.412 --> 13:49.788
Who taught you how
to solder a circuit?

13:50.623 --> 13:52.374
Or write a program? Or
French braid your hair?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.335
Or throw a spiral? Me.
That's what I do.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.170
Who taught you how to
cook without ketchup,

13:56.253 --> 13:57.880
or balance your checkbook?

14:00.299 --> 14:02.676
Who always has to be the
grownup around here?

14:04.011 --> 14:07.097
All right, you got a point, okay?
But that means we're a great team.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.725
And I know it's been sucky
around here lately.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.770
But we're gonna be fine, sweetie. You
just gotta keep believing, okay?

14:12.853 --> 14:14.188
I mean, that's what
great inventors do.

14:14.271 --> 14:18.234
I promise you, one day, I'm gonna
build something that matters.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.695
I believe you, Dad.

14:23.364 --> 14:25.658
You know, your mom would
be very proud of you.

14:27.535 --> 14:29.119
It's going to be okay.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.278
Spread out!
Push right!

15:02.361 --> 15:03.529
Roll,
roll, roll, roll.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.114
Give me two. Give me two.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.157
Take the beach, nice and easy.

15:08.993 --> 15:10.160
<i>All
right, hold what you got.</i>

15:12.371 --> 15:13.622
Release the mini-drones.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.100
<i>Vipers. Eagle in sight.
Cleared hot.</i>

15:35.102 --> 15:38.689
Got a heat sig. Second stack.
Closest to the bow.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.150
<i>Predator 0-1.
Captured target area.</i>

15:41.400 --> 15:42.901
<i>Set charges.</i>

15:47.489 --> 15:51.702
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.
Eagles moving internal. Second deck.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.707
Frogman
83, Frogman 83.

16:18.729 --> 16:20.064
Breached
site on rooftop.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.566
- Breached site on rooftop.
- Have Echo Platoon on standby.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.235
Let the Helo know we're
moving external!

16:28.405 --> 16:30.908
<i>Alpha, take port.
Bravo, take starboard.</i>

16:31.408 --> 16:32.910
<i>Shift right.
Shift right.</i>

16:39.166 --> 16:40.167
Cracking steel!

16:45.422 --> 16:46.465
No!

16:46.799 --> 16:48.634
Hit him,
hit him, hit him!

16:51.804 --> 16:52.846
Fire.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.307
<i>Missiles out.
Danger close.</i>

16:58.477 --> 16:59.812
He's running! Move!

17:00.270 --> 17:01.772
<i>He's on the run!
He's on the run!</i>

17:16.119 --> 17:17.788
No! Please!

17:18.914 --> 17:20.790
Hold your fire.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.212
Hold! Hold fire!

17:26.130 --> 17:28.507
Can you not see?
I've been injured.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.926
<i>- Box him in.
- Box him in.</i>

17:31.009 --> 17:34.555
Medical Officer Ratchet!
I'm a friend!

17:38.225 --> 17:39.560
I'm an Autobot!

17:39.893 --> 17:41.437
Then why are you running?

17:41.812 --> 17:44.398
Optimus sent this
distress message.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.316
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

17:46.400 --> 17:50.237
<i>We are under targeted attack.
Cease all contact with humans.</i>

17:50.738 --> 17:54.908
We're all hiding. All
Autobots are being hunted.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.160
We're all in danger.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.495
I lost a sister in Chicago.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.664
You'll get no sympathy from me.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.513
What's wrong with you humans?

18:24.104 --> 18:26.106
No! Please.

18:30.861 --> 18:32.529
Check
fire, check fire!

18:43.457 --> 18:45.459
He's mine now.

18:47.461 --> 18:48.796
Lockdown.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.632
Autobots, Decepticons.

18:51.965 --> 18:56.136
Like little children,
always fighting.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.056
Making a mess out
of the universe.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.725
Then I've got to clean it up.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.269
There is one way you survive.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.188
Tell me where he's hiding.

19:06.271 --> 19:09.566
Where is Optimus Prime?

19:10.901 --> 19:12.361
Never.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.497
Never is here.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.674
I must say, it is remarkable,

19:33.757 --> 19:36.260
really astounding, the
success that the CIA has had

19:36.343 --> 19:38.178
since you have taken
operational control,

19:38.262 --> 19:41.265
and so the President has
asked me to ask you

19:41.473 --> 19:43.183
to ask him,

19:43.517 --> 19:45.143
to invite you both

19:45.435 --> 19:47.396
over to the White
House just to powwow,

19:47.771 --> 19:52.442
where we get maybe some
more specifics about how

19:52.526 --> 19:55.988
exactly you're hunting the
enemy Decepticons left.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.365
I've had my desk for two years.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.784
Mr. Attinger has
been here for 25.

20:00.868 --> 20:04.413
He runs the projects where
I don't ask for specifics.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.206
That's why they're
called Black Ops.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.792
And why we all sleep
better at night.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.128
Check. That is great. So, um...

20:14.089 --> 20:17.259
Any dirt on that? Uh,
how, uh, that's going?

20:19.469 --> 20:20.596
Outstanding.

20:20.888 --> 20:22.014
Great. Oh, great.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.891
I was hoping to hear that. The
President will be pleased.

20:23.974 --> 20:28.395
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only
been Chief of Staff since Monday, um,

20:28.478 --> 20:31.857
but I do know that the alien
war stuff, these are...

20:31.940 --> 20:33.692
These are the only fun meetings.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.320
Look, I'm not here
to entertain the President,

20:36.528 --> 20:40.032
but you may tell him that
the war will be over.

20:40.782 --> 20:41.783
Soon.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.829
"...be over..." In case he asks, I
just like to have an exact quote.

20:45.913 --> 20:48.582
"War will be over soon." That is great.
Such good news.

20:48.665 --> 20:52.961
And, um, the President
would, I know, just love...

20:53.045 --> 20:55.255
Really, really love
to press the flesh...

20:55.339 --> 20:58.967
Not flesh, obviously, but just
maybe get a shot with, um...

20:59.051 --> 21:00.344
Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

21:00.552 --> 21:02.346
We could bop on Air Force One.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.097
It'd be just a quick bop, then
we just bop in and bop back.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.307
I wouldn't get
his hopes up on that one.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.391
Okay.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.226
He's
called Optimus Prime.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.521
Alien combatant. Here illegally.

21:12.064 --> 21:16.193
But aren't they our friends?
Why?

21:16.360 --> 21:19.404
Because our world will
never truly be safe

21:19.488 --> 21:20.614
till all of them are gone.

21:21.573 --> 21:25.535
Oh. Well, I would hope we could do
a much more ceremonial farewell.

21:25.702 --> 21:29.081
Especially since our military has
worked so closely with them.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.083
- Until you.
- It's not their planet.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.960
Never was.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.214
Time we take it back.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.102
All right, come on. Come on.

21:50.936 --> 21:53.480
Yes. Yes.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.107
Yes.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.275
Oh, there you go.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.069
No, hold it.

21:59.277 --> 22:02.155
Stop shaking! Why
are you shaking?

22:02.239 --> 22:03.281
You have the job!

22:04.282 --> 22:05.701
You forgot to eat dinner!

22:08.078 --> 22:10.080
You see why I worry?

22:12.958 --> 22:14.793
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

22:15.460 --> 22:17.295
I almost got it working right.

22:17.796 --> 22:21.299
So, listen, I'm done with
homework and set with finals,

22:21.383 --> 22:23.885
so I was just gonna take a
little drive with some friends

22:23.969 --> 22:25.387
if that was okay with you.

22:25.804 --> 22:29.307
No boys, I know. Graduate first.

22:29.599 --> 22:30.767
Exactly.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.937
You do know no one else
has this rule, right?

22:34.146 --> 22:37.149
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay.
It's wisdom.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.693
I don't think we need to be driving
around in the middle of the night.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.862
It's already like quarter to eight.
It's almost dark.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.530
Spud, will you stop it?

22:44.489 --> 22:46.408
You know where I was
for my graduation?

22:46.658 --> 22:48.827
Yes. With me, the mistake.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.788
The surprise, Tess. And the
best thing that ever happened.

22:52.122 --> 22:55.792
Do we look unhappy? Huh? No. It's
the greatest day of my life.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.129
I made your mother a
promise before she passed.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.923
Our baby's gonna be at her graduation.
That's it.

23:02.841 --> 23:05.677
High school boys know nothing. It's
only later they turn into men.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.388
So if you were older and
wiser, I wouldn't exist.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.058
That's not what I meant.

23:11.308 --> 23:12.893
You know, this is a
non-dating household, okay?

23:12.976 --> 23:14.603
You don't date, I don't date.
That's it.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.855
Well, maybe you should.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.566
Tessa, wait.

23:20.692 --> 23:21.735
Tessa?

23:23.320 --> 23:24.446
Look.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.657
I know I've been on you, okay?
But I have to be.

23:28.658 --> 23:31.203
Twelve to seventeen is the
official teenage danger window.

23:31.286 --> 23:35.499
It's my job to get you through it. So
you can be pissed off all you want.

23:39.002 --> 23:42.839
And, yes, you can take a
ride with your friends.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.257
Okay.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.093
Don't work all night.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.677
And eat.

24:05.862 --> 24:08.073
Best thing that ever
happened, Emily.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.034
She's the best thing
that ever happened.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.203
You'd be proud.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.210
Oh, no.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.220
Unbelievable.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.224
Unbelievable. God!

24:37.894 --> 24:40.730
Something in here needs to
make this family some money.

24:45.569 --> 24:46.903
Come on, you old wreck.

24:47.279 --> 24:48.738
Judgment Day.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.253
Where is he?

25:03.628 --> 25:04.880
I don't know.

25:05.297 --> 25:09.176
<i>Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!</i>

25:09.259 --> 25:10.343
Asshole.

25:10.427 --> 25:13.096
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

25:14.681 --> 25:17.601
Tess, I'm basically your uncle.
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

25:17.767 --> 25:19.603
And we're going
to lose the <i>casa.</i>

25:19.936 --> 25:21.104
Dad!

25:21.354 --> 25:22.689
Coming!

25:24.107 --> 25:26.943
Are you working with lasers?
If so, I'm not coming in.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.445
You guys have never seen a
truck like this before.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.030
Get in here. Lock that door.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.948
It doesn't have a lock.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.701
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator.
Look at the size of it.

25:34.910 --> 25:36.203
Something blew a hole in it!

25:36.286 --> 25:37.370
Yeah, so?

25:37.454 --> 25:38.747
It's not normal steel.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.333
The shrapnel in the engine, it
ripped all the connections apart.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.002
And watch. And this
took some Cade genius.

25:44.294 --> 25:45.921
You are gonna love this.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.632
When I hook this back
to a working battery...

25:51.801 --> 25:53.470
<i>Calling all...</i>

25:53.970 --> 25:55.972
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

25:56.139 --> 25:57.140
Oh, yeah.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.434
I don't think it's
a truck at all.

25:59.893 --> 26:01.561
I think we just found
a Transformer.

26:01.728 --> 26:02.896
Tran... Ugh!

26:03.438 --> 26:05.357
- Evacuate!
- Wait! Guys!

26:06.233 --> 26:08.735
Dad, are you out of your mind? You
need to get that thing out of here.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.029
You don't have to worry. I've been in
there working all night. I'm fine.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.614
You know what? That's not a truck, okay?
You're right.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.324
It's an alien killing machine.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.659
- Dude. It's DOA.
- Jesus.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.160
It's been recalled,
totaled, done.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.870
So, listen, there's a
number that you call.

26:18.954 --> 26:22.332
You're supposed to call the government.
It's the American thing to do.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.376
- Here we go.
- You're supposed to call,

26:24.459 --> 26:25.794
and if it ends up being alien,

26:25.961 --> 26:27.212
then you win $25,000.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.505
You don't win money.

26:28.588 --> 26:29.589
And if you can
capture it live...

26:29.839 --> 26:32.842
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest,
then you get $100,000.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.302
- Dad, we're making the call.
- I heard that.

26:34.511 --> 26:36.763
I've seen the commercial. They don't
say that. That's not a guarantee.

26:36.972 --> 26:38.306
You think Greg would lie to me?

26:38.556 --> 26:40.517
Look, if that's a Transformer
there from the Battle of Chicago,

26:40.600 --> 26:42.102
I need to know how it works.

26:42.185 --> 26:44.854
I'm an inventor. This could
be a game changer for me!

26:44.938 --> 26:46.773
If I can apply that
technology to my inventions,

26:46.856 --> 26:48.441
we'd never have to worry
about money again.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.985
I've heard that before.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.445
Twenty-five grand! It
pays for my college.

26:52.529 --> 26:53.571
It pays for the house.

26:54.239 --> 26:55.782
Besides, you used my money
to buy the truck, right?

26:55.865 --> 26:58.785
So technically, that's my truck.
Don't you think?

27:00.328 --> 27:02.789
You also signed a contract
regarding all research lab I.P.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.208
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.046
You signed it and now
you're competing.

27:10.380 --> 27:13.091
Any idea of yours is mine. Any
thought you have, I own it,

27:13.383 --> 27:14.884
so basically, I own you.

27:15.218 --> 27:17.220
I don't think you
can own someone.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.514
That was, like, a while
ago, even in Texas.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.976
All right. Bring the torch over
and help me with the pulley arm.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.105
I think the shrapnel
took out its power core.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.357
Oh, and, Tessa, you see this?

27:32.235 --> 27:34.487
Would an alien killing
machine let me do that?

27:34.612 --> 27:35.947
Look, I'll make the call.

27:36.031 --> 27:38.283
We'll get the money. Just first
let me see if I'm right.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.035
You want to hide in the house?
Go ahead.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.161
Okay.

27:42.162 --> 27:43.204
Let's go. Pulley arm.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.917
I can't believe him!

27:49.085 --> 27:51.379
What is that? Looks
like a missile.

27:51.629 --> 27:52.839
It is! Whoa!

28:07.270 --> 28:08.313
Dad!

28:08.563 --> 28:11.358
There's a missile
in the family room!

28:11.608 --> 28:13.610
Holy...

28:17.530 --> 28:19.032
I'll kill you!

28:23.745 --> 28:25.705
No! No!

28:27.665 --> 28:29.000
Dad, there's a missile in...

28:33.588 --> 28:35.965
I'll kill you! Stay back!

28:36.424 --> 28:39.052
- Oh, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
- Call 911! Run!

28:40.053 --> 28:41.513
- Lucas!
- Stop!

28:45.183 --> 28:47.310
Lucas? Don't move,
just calm down.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.649
Easy, human.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.360
Stay there. He's not
going to hurt us.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.072
Weapons systems damaged.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.448
A missile hit your engine.

29:01.157 --> 29:04.494
And we took it out of you.
You're hurt really bad.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.872
I'm just trying to help you.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.207
You're in my home now.
I'm an engineer.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.042
My name is Cade Yeager.

29:11.626 --> 29:14.712
Cade, I am in your debt.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.633
My name is Optimus Prime.

29:19.634 --> 29:21.302
My Autobots.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.638
They're in danger.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.103
I need to go. I need to go now.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.522
How far you think
you're gonna get?

29:33.857 --> 29:35.900
Tessa, come here.
He needs our help.

29:37.694 --> 29:38.987
What happened to you?

29:39.320 --> 29:43.491
An ambush. A trap.
Set by humans.

29:48.037 --> 29:50.248
I escaped and took this form.

29:50.415 --> 29:51.791
But you're on our side.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.002
Why would humans hurt you?

29:54.085 --> 29:57.464
They were not alone.

29:57.547 --> 30:01.801
- My Autobots can repair me.
- Yeah.

30:03.094 --> 30:04.762
If you can reach 'em.

30:11.269 --> 30:12.729
What about me?

30:34.918 --> 30:37.086
I warn you, Mr.
Attinger of Earth,

30:38.087 --> 30:41.090
an alliance is a
contract, and contracts,

30:41.758 --> 30:43.468
like humans,

30:44.260 --> 30:45.595
expire.

30:45.803 --> 30:48.515
On this planet,
we have a saying.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.808
"The enemy of my
enemy is my friend."

30:51.309 --> 30:53.186
I also have a saying.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.355
"I don't care."

30:57.273 --> 30:58.733
So what happened in Mexico City?

30:59.067 --> 31:00.068
I thought you had him.

31:00.151 --> 31:04.781
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.
Then your men allowed him to escape.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.825
You promised me
human intelligence.

31:08.201 --> 31:10.620
Or is there such a thing?

31:11.162 --> 31:13.164
You know, you've
still never told me.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.375
Why do you want him?

31:15.708 --> 31:17.335
Who are you working for?

31:17.418 --> 31:22.257
Every galaxy I've traveled,
all you species are the same.

31:22.340 --> 31:25.843
You all think you're the
center of the universe.

31:26.844 --> 31:29.514
You have no idea.

31:31.349 --> 31:33.059
Go to the hardware store
and you get the list.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.102
The whole list.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.228
What, you're going
to try and fix him?

31:35.311 --> 31:36.604
He's not a model
train set, Cade.

31:36.688 --> 31:38.147
No, that's right.
He's important.

31:38.231 --> 31:39.357
Yeah, but important to who?

31:39.440 --> 31:41.359
You can't keep an alien
locked up in your barn.

31:41.442 --> 31:42.443
What are you gonna
do, play with him?

31:42.652 --> 31:43.903
- Will you calm down?
- I'm trying to,

31:44.028 --> 31:46.406
but I just got hit in the
head with a ten-foot cannon!

31:46.489 --> 31:48.116
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

31:48.408 --> 31:49.909
Not a word to anybody.
Do you hear me?

31:49.993 --> 31:50.994
Not a single word.

31:51.286 --> 31:52.453
<i>Nobody.</i>

31:58.710 --> 32:00.253
I think we have a lock
on a high-value target.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.339
Special Operations
group is ready.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.841
What do you got?

32:04.924 --> 32:07.510
Sir, Special Ops just got
a call from Paris, Texas.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.013
Hard match on the truck
seen leaving Mexico City.

32:10.179 --> 32:12.432
Son of a bitch.
Let's go get him.

32:17.437 --> 32:19.022
Took a hell of a hit, you know.

32:19.105 --> 32:21.107
The missile just missed
your power source.

32:22.066 --> 32:23.985
We call it a Spark.

32:24.110 --> 32:28.323
It contains our life
force and our memories.

32:29.198 --> 32:30.408
Yeah, we call it a soul.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.495
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.790
Thank you for your efforts,
ladies and gentlemen.

32:37.874 --> 32:39.292
This room is going dark.

32:40.543 --> 32:41.794
The exit
is on your left.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.213
- I'll take it from here.
- Okay, let's go.

32:45.882 --> 32:48.217
I'm with Cemetery Wind.
We're on the move.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.303
<i>Repeat, on the move.</i>

33:00.772 --> 33:01.939
Cade.

33:02.357 --> 33:05.068
Why are you willing to help me?

33:05.943 --> 33:08.363
I guess maybe because
you trust me to.

33:25.505 --> 33:26.506
I'm back!

33:26.756 --> 33:28.091
Took you long enough!

33:28.424 --> 33:29.884
My head hurts. I had
to go to the doctor.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.719
I got a welt on my head

33:31.803 --> 33:34.222
that makes me look like a
fricking <i>Star Trek</i> character.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.348
Whatever.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.193
Look! Look!

34:02.375 --> 34:03.459
<i>We're on property.</i>

34:03.543 --> 34:05.461
<i>Viper 15 overhead.
Angels 1.</i>

34:19.766 --> 34:20.768
Dad!

35:02.435 --> 35:05.521
Mr. Yeager, my name's James Savoy.
I'm a federal agent.

35:05.605 --> 35:09.275
My men and I are trying to
track down an abandoned truck.

35:14.113 --> 35:17.158
It's a nice spread you got here.
Too bad she's for sale.

35:17.533 --> 35:18.701
Well, thanks. She's not.

35:20.453 --> 35:21.954
That the truck you mean?

35:23.289 --> 35:24.499
Afraid not.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.502
You know, Mr. Yeager, we
received a call from someone

35:27.585 --> 35:29.128
concerned about this truck.

35:29.212 --> 35:30.213
Oh, no.

35:30.505 --> 35:31.672
That wasn't you?

35:32.715 --> 35:34.592
Only thing I'm concerned about
is you being on my property

35:34.675 --> 35:35.843
without permission.

35:35.927 --> 35:38.971
You know, we got a rule about people
messing with people from Texas.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.431
And I don't know what truck
you're talking about.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.934
The kind that cost
American lives.

35:43.309 --> 35:44.519
Search the property!

35:44.727 --> 35:45.812
What do you mean,
"Search the property"?

35:45.895 --> 35:46.896
You don't have a warrant.

35:47.104 --> 35:49.106
My face is my warrant.

35:50.775 --> 35:53.444
Wait. But if you guys do find a
truck, we get a reward, right?

35:53.861 --> 35:55.905
<i>Viper 15
holding, point alpha.</i>

36:01.118 --> 36:02.620
<i>Charlie team, hold tight.</i>

36:03.246 --> 36:04.497
<i>Lock it down.</i>

36:04.872 --> 36:07.375
- Open, open, open.
- Short wall. Short wall.

36:07.834 --> 36:08.960
Five in. Five in.

36:09.252 --> 36:11.587
<i>Intruder alert! Back
away from the premises.</i>

36:11.671 --> 36:13.673
- What the hell is that?
- Just some dumb inventor.

36:13.923 --> 36:14.923
Clear.

36:14.966 --> 36:15.967
Clear.

36:16.592 --> 36:17.927
Clear right.

36:18.427 --> 36:19.428
Clear.

36:19.595 --> 36:22.014
360. 720.
Heads on a swivel.

36:31.816 --> 36:33.776
Let's go. There's nothing here.

36:38.531 --> 36:40.449
There's no signs.
We got nothing.

36:40.658 --> 36:42.952
Sir, we have a live armed
missile in the trash.

36:43.202 --> 36:47.707
Live? I carried that to the trash!
You told me that was a dud, dude.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.376
I could be dead. Right?

36:51.294 --> 36:53.296
Look. Okay, yes, I found
a truck, all right.

36:53.713 --> 36:54.755
I towed it back for the parts.

36:55.006 --> 36:56.799
I left it here last night.
This morning, it's gone.

36:56.883 --> 36:58.217
When? Where? I don't know.
I swear to God.

36:58.301 --> 36:59.385
That's as much as
I know about him.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.137
"Him."

37:03.055 --> 37:04.098
He said, "Him."

37:05.057 --> 37:06.309
<i>He knows who the
son of a bitch is.</i>

37:08.895 --> 37:10.479
- Mr. Yeager.
- What?

37:10.605 --> 37:11.689
Excuse me.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.650
You just said, "Him."

37:16.485 --> 37:17.737
- Take them down.
- What?

37:18.988 --> 37:20.323
Ow! Let me go!

37:20.573 --> 37:22.909
They don't know about the truck!
I know! Just let her go.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.912
What kind of a man betrays
his flesh-and-blood

37:25.995 --> 37:27.872
brethren for alien metal?

37:27.955 --> 37:28.998
- Get this guy out of my sight.
- Get off!

37:29.206 --> 37:30.875
Let her go! They don't
know about the truck.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.209
All right! Load up!
Search the perimeter!

37:32.627 --> 37:34.378
Lucas, you called, didn't you?

37:34.629 --> 37:37.006
No! I don't know any
of these scary guys.

37:37.340 --> 37:39.634
Oh, God! You're manhandling a woman!
I'll kick your ass!

37:39.842 --> 37:41.344
Let her go!

37:42.094 --> 37:44.388
- Daddy! Let me go!
- You're not going anywhere.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.307
Daddy!

37:46.515 --> 37:47.808
No! You're not
taking me anywhere!

37:48.809 --> 37:49.852
I'm an American!

37:50.853 --> 37:51.896
- Easy, sweetheart.
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:52.355 --> 37:54.523
All right. Okay. All right.
I was wrong.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.777
Savoy. Use the girl.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.445
Oh, my God! Ahh!

38:05.201 --> 38:08.037
Now, you got ten seconds.
Where's the truck?

38:12.166 --> 38:14.251
- You're gonna shoot my little girl?
- If I have to.

38:14.377 --> 38:15.378
Please don't shoot me! Please!

38:15.586 --> 38:17.755
Look, I don't know. I told you
everything that I know! He's gone.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.590
He left. He was in the
barn, I swear to God!

38:19.966 --> 38:21.550
<i>- Just let her go!</i>
<i>- Ow!</i>

38:22.051 --> 38:23.219
Please, please.

38:23.594 --> 38:25.346
He was in there! Let her go!

38:25.638 --> 38:26.681
Seven seconds.

38:27.014 --> 38:29.892
I'm telling you the truth!
He was in there!

38:32.353 --> 38:33.354
Dad!

38:33.521 --> 38:36.065
Tell him to get away
from my little girl now!

38:37.191 --> 38:38.651
Dad!

38:39.610 --> 38:40.653
You touch her
and I'll kill you!

38:43.030 --> 38:44.073
You got two seconds.

38:44.740 --> 38:45.825
I need the truth.

38:46.158 --> 38:47.952
- Please.
- Shoot her.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.593
Here I am!

39:09.432 --> 39:10.516
- Get down!
- Ahh!

39:10.599 --> 39:15.062
Cade! They're going to kill you!
Get out of here!

39:28.617 --> 39:30.077
Push right! Headed to the house!

39:43.007 --> 39:44.300
Come on. Hurry up!
Get in the car!

39:44.592 --> 39:45.634
- Let's go!
- Daddy, get in the car!

39:54.393 --> 39:56.687
Perimeter, Optimus
moving your way!

40:18.125 --> 40:19.376
What's happening, baby?
Who are they?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.462
It's the truck. They
want the truck!

40:22.004 --> 40:24.090
"Who are they"? Who are you, and
who are you calling "baby"?

40:25.216 --> 40:26.217
I know you heard me.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.676
- I'm her boyfriend!
- He's my boyfriend!

40:28.052 --> 40:30.471
What? You're not her boyfriend!

40:30.721 --> 40:32.973
His name's Shane and
he drives, Dad.

40:37.311 --> 40:40.231
What kind of cars are those?
They're so scary!

40:44.151 --> 40:45.402
There's another
one coming up the back!

40:48.405 --> 40:50.157
You gotta try to lose
them in the cornfield!

41:14.348 --> 41:15.391
He's coming up behind us! Go!

41:15.599 --> 41:17.101
<i>Viper 15,
running on fumes. RTB.</i>

41:24.817 --> 41:25.860
They've got us cornered!

41:27.987 --> 41:29.363
Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

41:38.080 --> 41:40.082
Mr. Yeager, this is not how
I wanted us to meet, okay?

41:40.249 --> 41:41.667
I'm Shane, and I'm
a completely...

41:41.750 --> 41:43.627
And I am not talking to you!
Drive the car!

41:43.836 --> 41:45.337
- - Watch out!
Watch out!

41:56.599 --> 41:58.309
<i>Throw
'em some warning shots!</i>

42:03.856 --> 42:05.482
Man, I don't know how
I'm driving this good.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.484
It's like, today I've gone
to a whole other level.

42:07.568 --> 42:08.777
Road, focus! Stop talking!

42:11.238 --> 42:12.448
Shane, look out!

42:18.621 --> 42:20.915
This may be primarily
my fault, okay.

42:20.998 --> 42:22.374
They said they were
gonna bring a check!

42:22.458 --> 42:23.918
I didn't know they were
gonna send a death squad!

42:33.427 --> 42:35.054
Hang on!

42:36.222 --> 42:38.265
Hey, we got ourselves a winner!
Don's got it over here.

42:38.349 --> 42:39.350
Look out!

42:45.439 --> 42:48.525
We lost them! Good job,
stranger from the cornfields!

42:57.368 --> 42:58.994
The scary cars are back.

43:01.330 --> 43:02.665
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

43:17.805 --> 43:19.556
I thought you knew how
to drive this thing! Go!

43:23.560 --> 43:26.355
I don't think we're gonna get that money.
Doesn't seem like it.

43:35.739 --> 43:36.907
Cade!

43:48.085 --> 43:49.086
Take 'em upstairs!

43:52.798 --> 43:54.216
We're losing them
on the fifth floor.

44:00.848 --> 44:02.266
- Do that thing, Shane!
- You know it.

44:02.391 --> 44:03.642
What do you mean? What thing?

44:03.726 --> 44:05.477
What we're about to do is
gonna be kind of scary.

44:07.813 --> 44:09.857
Take out your guns
and shoot them!

44:12.943 --> 44:14.028
They're shooting at us!

44:14.194 --> 44:15.821
- Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick!
- What?

44:16.071 --> 44:17.448
She's got the best
hands in the business.

44:19.783 --> 44:21.410
Ready, Tess? Pull!

44:26.498 --> 44:28.584
- No! No! No!
- No f-ing way!

44:37.259 --> 44:39.053
Oh! Yeah!

44:41.722 --> 44:42.848
Yeah!

44:43.432 --> 44:45.267
Tessa, you are so grounded!

44:45.851 --> 44:47.102
Shit! The rim's cracked.

44:50.189 --> 44:51.857
Optimus. Come on, move! Move!

44:53.734 --> 44:55.110
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade!

44:55.194 --> 44:57.154
- Lucas!
- Wait! Wait!

44:58.572 --> 45:00.366
Lucas! Lucas, above you!

45:00.824 --> 45:02.117
Run!

45:28.477 --> 45:30.145
Come on,
get in, let's go!

45:33.732 --> 45:36.151
<i>I'll bet you wish you
could see my face right now.</i>

46:23.532 --> 46:25.534
Lucas, we just left him?

46:26.618 --> 46:27.953
He's gone.

46:46.054 --> 46:49.933
My deepest sympathies for
the loss of your friend.

46:50.392 --> 46:53.729
Stay here till I'm sure
we weren't followed.

46:54.062 --> 46:56.732
We are all targets now.

47:03.906 --> 47:06.658
So we're hiding out now?
That's the plan?

47:06.742 --> 47:08.410
We're taking orders
from a truck?

47:08.744 --> 47:10.412
Well, you got a better idea?

47:12.539 --> 47:15.083
Hey, move away from her, kid.
Don't...

47:15.417 --> 47:17.544
Keep your hands off her.
All right? No.

47:17.753 --> 47:21.590
You got your ass kicked by a
garage inventor from Texas.

47:21.882 --> 47:23.425
That goes on your resume.

47:23.842 --> 47:25.636
Yeah, it goes on
all of yours, too!

47:25.719 --> 47:28.680
Do I look like I'm in the mood
for any of your shit today?

47:30.015 --> 47:32.226
Washington thinks we were
chasing a Decepticon target,

47:32.309 --> 47:35.312
but our story falls apart if we don't
find this Yeager family first.

47:35.812 --> 47:38.065
Yeah, well, what if he goes
to the cops or the FBI?

47:38.148 --> 47:39.358
They know to hand him over.

47:40.275 --> 47:42.444
His world as he
knows it is gone.

47:48.534 --> 47:51.370
Well, bright side, you guys met.

47:53.121 --> 47:54.623
Where is he from?

47:54.706 --> 47:56.500
I told you, he's a
driver from Texas.

47:56.583 --> 47:57.626
Texas?

47:58.544 --> 48:00.379
Where, Dublin, Texas?
Shamrock, Texas?

48:00.462 --> 48:01.588
So why does he sound
like a leprechaun?

48:02.130 --> 48:04.466
You'd get your ass kicked
in Ireland for saying that.

48:04.550 --> 48:06.426
Well, we're not in Ireland, Lucky Charms.
We're in Texas.

48:07.844 --> 48:09.096
And so he drives? What
do you mean, he drives?

48:09.179 --> 48:10.180
Like, for a living?

48:10.472 --> 48:13.267
Yeah. At least he
makes a living.

48:13.809 --> 48:15.060
Thank you.

48:15.602 --> 48:16.979
Look, I race rally cars.

48:17.062 --> 48:18.063
One driver.

48:18.647 --> 48:20.816
One navigator. Her.

48:20.899 --> 48:22.067
By the way, I'm totally legit.

48:22.776 --> 48:24.820
I just got picked
up by Red Bull.

48:25.612 --> 48:26.989
And just so you know,

48:27.155 --> 48:29.992
my life savings was in
that car back there.

48:30.242 --> 48:32.661
- This is not happening.
- Oh, it definitely is.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.795
How old are you?

48:42.462 --> 48:43.463
Twenty.

48:43.755 --> 48:45.507
She's a 17-year-old girl.

48:45.924 --> 48:47.676
So we can work this two ways.

48:47.759 --> 48:50.762
One, I punch you right in the mouth
and you call the police on me.

48:50.846 --> 48:51.847
Dad. Or two,

48:53.015 --> 48:55.517
I just call the cops on you because
this is illegal. She's a minor.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.519
We're protected by the
Romeo and Juliet laws.

48:57.811 --> 48:58.979
We dated for
a little while.

48:59.146 --> 49:00.606
I was a sophomore, and he was a senior.
It's fine.

49:00.689 --> 49:01.940
No, it's not fine.

49:02.149 --> 49:05.110
We've got a preexisting juvenile
foundational relationship.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.447
- Statute 22.011.
- What?

49:09.114 --> 49:10.741
Texas statute?

49:10.824 --> 49:12.075
- That a real law?
- Yep.

49:13.619 --> 49:14.745
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

49:16.913 --> 49:19.207
- You know how those two ended up?
- In love.

49:19.499 --> 49:21.918
Dead. Do your parents
know about this?

49:22.252 --> 49:24.755
Is your dad okay with you
dating a 17-year-old girl?

49:24.838 --> 49:28.175
He took off when I was five, but if
I ever bump into him, I'll ask him.

49:28.925 --> 49:30.427
You know, Tessa,

49:30.927 --> 49:32.971
- I trusted you.
- To what?

49:33.221 --> 49:37.225
Never have fun, take a risk, be
a normal teenager, like you?

49:37.392 --> 49:38.435
I am your father, okay?

49:38.518 --> 49:40.729
And I have been busting my
ass to take care of you.

49:40.896 --> 49:43.607
Is that what you were doing when
you brought home the truck?

49:43.774 --> 49:47.319
All you had to do was report
it, and now Lucas is dead.

49:48.028 --> 49:49.946
And my life is over. Thank you.

49:50.197 --> 49:51.740
You've taken real
good care of me.

50:04.086 --> 50:05.337
<i>Please don't shoot me!</i>

50:05.587 --> 50:06.880
Please! Dad!

50:08.507 --> 50:09.883
They were willing to kill her.

50:11.259 --> 50:12.302
Then they still are.

50:15.263 --> 50:16.723
Somebody somewhere
gave that order.

50:16.807 --> 50:18.100
I'm going to find
some fingerprints.

50:21.228 --> 50:23.146
<i>Please!</i>

50:25.607 --> 50:26.775
<i>No!</i>

50:27.442 --> 50:30.028
<i>I'm an Autobot! I'm an Autobot!</i>

50:30.529 --> 50:32.072
<i>Grab whatever you think
we can use for supplies.</i>

50:32.364 --> 50:34.491
Clothes, anything. And
take that computer.

50:37.953 --> 50:39.287
Let's go.

50:46.712 --> 50:47.754
This is not easy.

50:48.171 --> 50:50.132
You know, you don't
suck at everything, Dad.

50:54.219 --> 50:55.429
What the...

51:06.690 --> 51:07.816
I knew it.

51:11.987 --> 51:13.113
You told me he was no one.

51:14.656 --> 51:15.824
Well,

51:16.533 --> 51:19.286
this "no one" has our tech.

51:44.227 --> 51:45.645
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

51:46.271 --> 51:48.106
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

51:58.450 --> 51:59.659
- Whoa! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

52:23.642 --> 52:24.643
That was insane!

52:24.726 --> 52:26.311
It was awesome, but
it was insane, right?

52:37.405 --> 52:40.575
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!

52:40.909 --> 52:43.954
He's back! He's alive!

52:44.287 --> 52:46.957
Optimus is here!

52:55.924 --> 52:59.219
At last. There is
hope after all.

53:18.405 --> 53:20.907
Yeah.

53:21.283 --> 53:24.452
Mr. Leader of the
Free Galaxy is back.

53:24.786 --> 53:27.956
I knew you'd make it.
I never doubted.

53:28.123 --> 53:30.959
We got your warning.
We've been waiting.

53:31.459 --> 53:35.589
Hell, yeah. Boom time. We
got the gang back together.

53:54.524 --> 53:57.861
Humans have asked us to
play by their rules.

53:58.194 --> 54:01.990
Well, the rules
have just changed.

54:02.324 --> 54:05.660
Human beings, bunch of
backstabbin' weasels.

54:05.827 --> 54:07.996
Hound, find your inner compass.

54:08.121 --> 54:12.250
Loyalty is but a flower in the
winds of fear and temptation.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.960
What the hell are you saying?

54:14.044 --> 54:15.462
- It's a haiku.
- Cut the crap,

54:15.545 --> 54:17.380
before I drop a grenade
down your throat.

54:17.464 --> 54:18.840
Try it, you'll be dead.

54:18.924 --> 54:20.550
Oh, please pull it.
Please do it.

54:21.343 --> 54:23.261
<i>You know what, it'll
save us so much time.</i>

54:23.595 --> 54:25.013
Well, raise your hand

54:25.096 --> 54:29.434
if you're thoroughly disenchanted with
our little pleasant Earth vacation.

54:29.809 --> 54:31.019
So, who's the stowaways?

54:31.353 --> 54:32.896
Oh, whoa, hey,
what's with the gun?

54:32.979 --> 54:34.606
Stop. Hound, both of you.

54:34.689 --> 54:37.067
They've risked their
lives for mine.

54:37.734 --> 54:39.402
<i>We owe them.</i>

54:40.904 --> 54:43.239
<i>So, there's been no
sign of any others?</i>

54:43.573 --> 54:45.700
<i>- Nada.</i>
- We are all that's left.

54:45.784 --> 54:47.911
They're picking
us off, one by one.

54:47.994 --> 54:51.790
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome.
And you make five.

54:53.124 --> 54:55.418
So that's our
best-case scenario?

54:56.127 --> 54:57.963
Autobot witness protection?

54:58.713 --> 55:01.633
Hey, Speed Racer, you're
welcome to leave anytime.

55:02.050 --> 55:04.219
Well, for the record, Superdad,

55:04.469 --> 55:07.806
I'm not hiding with you. I'm
hiding out with that big guy.

55:08.223 --> 55:10.767
<i>Sensei,</i> with your fate unknown,

55:10.892 --> 55:12.769
Bumblebee has held command,

55:12.894 --> 55:15.522
despite his complete and
total lack of anything

55:15.647 --> 55:18.316
resembling warrior discipline.

55:18.400 --> 55:19.442
He's like a child.

55:19.526 --> 55:21.069
<i>This child is about
to kick your ass.</i>

55:21.152 --> 55:22.696
He brings us shame.

55:24.948 --> 55:26.324
Cage fight.

55:26.574 --> 55:27.575
Smartass.

55:27.742 --> 55:28.952
What's the matter with them?

55:31.079 --> 55:33.540
Am I the lone sage
who sees through

55:33.623 --> 55:36.418
this puppy-dog eyes act?
It's beneath you.

55:36.584 --> 55:39.337
Yes, I've been waiting for them
all to dispatch each other,

55:39.421 --> 55:41.506
so I could take charge
with no trouble at all.

55:41.589 --> 55:43.049
Just me reporting to me.

55:43.508 --> 55:44.926
Well, it sure looks like
you've been missed.

55:45.135 --> 55:48.471
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us

55:48.930 --> 55:51.099
and humans are helping.

55:51.516 --> 55:53.518
We need to know why.

55:53.893 --> 55:56.563
Well, listen, I don't know why,
but I have an idea about who.

55:59.691 --> 56:02.861
This drone I stole recorded
footage of an Autobot raid.

56:04.279 --> 56:07.032
It's in pieces, but watch
what happens here.

56:08.324 --> 56:10.118
Oh, that's Leadfoot.

56:10.368 --> 56:11.703
They rip him apart.

56:11.786 --> 56:13.163
Savages.

56:13.663 --> 56:15.498
And later, this truck
comes to haul him off.

56:15.582 --> 56:16.916
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

56:17.083 --> 56:19.294
Defense, aerospace,
government contracts.

56:19.627 --> 56:21.254
They designed this drone.

56:21.546 --> 56:23.006
So these government guys
just hunt you down,

56:23.089 --> 56:24.758
and then pass you
off to this KSI?

56:25.717 --> 56:27.427
The company is
headquartered in Chicago.

56:27.510 --> 56:29.137
That could be where
they were taken.

56:29.220 --> 56:31.139
No way to get inside
without a battle.

56:31.473 --> 56:33.975
Well, what if you had
some human help?

56:34.267 --> 56:36.436
- What, are you two partners now?
- Sweetie, we're targets now, too.

56:36.519 --> 56:38.980
We need to know why or we'll
never get our lives back.

56:39.064 --> 56:40.106
Autobots,

56:40.482 --> 56:43.068
I have sworn to
never kill humans.

56:43.151 --> 56:44.402
Big mistake.

56:44.486 --> 56:46.654
But when I find out
who's behind this,

56:47.906 --> 56:49.908
he's going to die.

56:49.991 --> 56:51.076
Hooah!

57:05.465 --> 57:07.217
<i>There's a full-on
manhunt out for us,</i>

57:07.300 --> 57:08.676
<i>so we have some new rules.</i>

57:08.927 --> 57:10.845
<i>Anyone who has got a
badge is not our friend.</i>

57:11.346 --> 57:12.847
<i>We're gonna divide and conquer.</i>

57:13.181 --> 57:16.059
<i>You two in charge of stealing food and
the essentials. And nothing else.</i>

57:22.899 --> 57:25.110
<i>Chicago KSI headquarters
is like a fortress.</i>

57:25.193 --> 57:27.278
<i>I'm gonna find a way into their
top-secret military wing.</i>

57:27.362 --> 57:29.948
<i>Find something to blackmail this
company and the government.</i>

57:30.031 --> 57:31.908
<i>We're gonna get
our freedom back.</i>

57:40.667 --> 57:42.794
Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

57:48.883 --> 57:49.926
What was that sound?

57:50.385 --> 57:52.220
That's "the" sound.

57:52.679 --> 57:53.888
That you asked for.

57:55.390 --> 57:58.476
No, I asked for boundless.
Transcendent.

57:58.726 --> 57:59.894
When you walk through a
door in this building,

58:00.061 --> 58:02.480
it should sound like you've
stepped into the future.

58:08.736 --> 58:09.821
Present.

58:14.075 --> 58:15.243
Say it.

58:15.493 --> 58:16.578
Future.

58:17.245 --> 58:20.748
<i>The past is history.
The present is past.</i>

58:21.040 --> 58:22.792
<i>The future is now.</i>

58:22.876 --> 58:24.919
Why can't I get in
touch with you?

58:26.462 --> 58:28.923
Don't you realize what
the Arctic find means?

58:30.091 --> 58:32.594
You know that story we
were all told as children

58:32.677 --> 58:34.971
about a giant asteroid
that struck the Earth

58:35.054 --> 58:37.432
millions of years ago and
wiped out the dinosaurs?

58:37.515 --> 58:39.726
- Vaguely.
- We were wrong.

58:40.185 --> 58:42.729
This metal caused the
great extinction.

58:43.062 --> 58:44.314
How and why, I can't yet say.

58:44.731 --> 58:47.984
But carbon dating puts it
at 65 million years B.C.

58:48.401 --> 58:51.779
This ore you've got us digging for is
a lot more dangerous than you think.

58:51.863 --> 58:52.906
And my people...

58:52.989 --> 58:57.076
Darcy, I think that you've been out
in the field for far too long.

58:57.619 --> 59:00.121
Why don't we discuss
dinosaurs over dinner?

59:00.455 --> 59:02.665
- Ribs?
- Not a chance.

59:03.458 --> 59:06.211
You have no idea what's
been happening here.

59:07.295 --> 59:09.172
We're about to make
the quantum leap.

59:10.381 --> 59:12.133
A rare-earth metal.

59:12.842 --> 59:14.844
Molecularly unstable.

59:15.178 --> 59:17.847
Industrial uses, none.

59:19.474 --> 59:20.558
And then the aliens came.

59:21.059 --> 59:22.352
And we made the connection.

59:23.228 --> 59:25.188
It's what they're made of.

59:25.647 --> 59:26.856
<i>It's the Holy Grail.</i>

59:27.732 --> 59:30.151
"Transformium." That's
what we're calling it.

59:30.235 --> 59:31.653
Focus-grouped. Catchy.

59:31.736 --> 59:32.904
- Trademarked.
- Yeah.

59:33.321 --> 59:36.449
This is the greatest
advance in modern physics

59:36.532 --> 59:37.992
since the splitting of the atom.

59:38.409 --> 59:40.495
It's programmable matter.

59:40.828 --> 59:42.121
And now, we've
mapped its genome.

59:42.330 --> 59:44.666
- I.
- Now you've mapped its genome.

59:44.791 --> 59:49.003
And now we can begin to give it

59:49.087 --> 59:50.755
instructions.

59:56.552 --> 59:58.221
This is extremely good.

59:59.347 --> 01:00:00.682
Watch this.

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:12.026
We can change anything
into anything.

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.782
Sensual, almost.
Don't you think?

01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:24.706
Do you like music?

01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:26.833
The Pill.

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:31.671
Perhaps something a
little more violent?

01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:38.553
Oh, my God. You've done it.

01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:41.472
In aerospace, the military...

01:00:41.556 --> 01:00:44.475
We will own the entire
robotics industry.

01:00:44.559 --> 01:00:46.144
All exploration.

01:00:46.227 --> 01:00:49.105
The oceans. Space. Everything.

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.775
Wembley. What is this?

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:55.403
The jellyfish commercial
that you wanted.

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:58.364
You said they were erotic
yet deadly, like women.

01:00:58.448 --> 01:00:59.824
I never said that.

01:01:00.158 --> 01:01:01.659
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

01:01:01.743 --> 01:01:02.744
I definitely heard you say it

01:01:02.827 --> 01:01:03.995
'cause you were talking
about your ex-girlfriend,

01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:05.788
who was sexy, but a bitch.

01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:07.874
Please don't
eat on the tour.

01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:09.917
Is that her?

01:01:14.422 --> 01:01:16.841
Hey, I found a whole
bunch of boxes of clothes.

01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:19.135
So, sweetie, you can get some long
pants, nice, loose-fitting ones,

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:21.220
and lose the short shorts, okay?
What'd you guys get?

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:25.933
It's protein.

01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:27.935
Look, I said the
essentials, okay?

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:30.396
It wasn't easy. We
almost got caught.

01:01:30.772 --> 01:01:31.856
You stole mouthwash?

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.775
I like to be fresh when I'm
making out with your daughter.

01:01:35.401 --> 01:01:36.903
That's funny.

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:42.200
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:44.869
Ever?

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:48.122
This is our military
prototype, Galvatron.

01:01:49.332 --> 01:01:50.833
I don't understand it.

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:53.378
This is the fifth iteration.

01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:54.712
Why does he keep
turning out like this?

01:01:55.797 --> 01:01:57.632
It's just some bugs
in the final render.

01:01:58.674 --> 01:02:01.844
I modeled Galvatron
after Optimus Prime.

01:02:01.928 --> 01:02:04.263
Why does he keep
looking like Megatron?

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:06.974
<i>Rendering sequence
is almost finished. Stand by.</i>

01:02:07.058 --> 01:02:08.684
Simple coding.

01:02:11.104 --> 01:02:12.772
Algorithms!

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:15.024
Math!

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:18.444
Why can't we make
what we want to make,

01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:20.446
the way we want to make it?

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:23.116
Why?

01:02:25.326 --> 01:02:28.871
And does that look like a
consumer-friendly face to you?

01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:32.959
And what about that big
hole in the chest?

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:35.294
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

01:02:35.545 --> 01:02:37.880
- Love it.
- Well, I hate it.

01:02:40.174 --> 01:02:41.509
Oh, here he is.

01:02:41.884 --> 01:02:44.053
That bald-headed
Doc Frankenstein.

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.932
Ma'am, this is not legal. This
is illegal experimentation.

01:02:48.224 --> 01:02:50.017
Aliens would never
do this to people!

01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:51.686
Eat you, kill you,
maybe, but that's it.

01:02:51.853 --> 01:02:54.105
This ain't right! Nobody
puts baby in a box!

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:56.441
Ahhh!

01:02:57.692 --> 01:02:58.985
This is worse than
waterboarding!

01:02:59.068 --> 01:03:01.028
This little gentleman has
been translating for us

01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:03.573
all the information that
comes from these two heads.

01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:06.492
Their history, their
science, everything.

01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:08.995
- Is that Megatron?
- Precisely.

01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:10.872
Where did you get all this?

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.582
Special government contract.

01:03:12.874 --> 01:03:14.292
Now we know everything
about Transformers.

01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:17.378
And now at long last we
can build them ourselves.

01:03:17.712 --> 01:03:19.338
And we can build them better.

01:03:41.027 --> 01:03:43.237
Yeah, that's good, Bee.
That'll get us in.

01:03:48.618 --> 01:03:49.952
<i>A couple times a
day, these guys are moving</i>

01:03:50.036 --> 01:03:52.788
<i>in vehicle shipments into KSI for
something called "scanning."</i>

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:54.665
Major security all over.

01:03:54.749 --> 01:03:58.252
So our best shot at getting in is a
back classified research entrance.

01:03:58.336 --> 01:04:00.463
<i>I'm gonna drive in with
Bee tomorrow morning.</i>

01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:06.302
Excuse me.

01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:08.095
There's no smooching
in front of me, okay?

01:04:08.721 --> 01:04:11.015
You're so square.
Who even says "smooching"?

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:12.850
I tell you, no respect.

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:14.602
It's just impossible sometimes.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:17.605
Yeah. I went through
that with Bumblebee.

01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:27.490
Calm down. Calm down.

01:04:28.616 --> 01:04:29.617
You know, at a time like this,

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.662
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool,
so why don't you lose the glasses?

01:04:34.747 --> 01:04:35.790
About a month ago,

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:39.085
middle of the night, I thought
I heard noises in my house.

01:04:39.168 --> 01:04:40.419
Was that you?

01:04:40.503 --> 01:04:41.546
What? Come on. No way.

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:42.630
Don't lie to me, kid.

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:44.757
You see that guy with
the gun out there?

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:45.883
There's so many guys with guns.

01:04:45.967 --> 01:04:46.968
Let's get out of the
car and tell him

01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:48.302
we're about to break
in and it's your idea,

01:04:48.386 --> 01:04:50.471
'cause I don't care. I'm old,
I've already lived long enough.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.722
You have a really bad habit

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:53.349
of having these conversations
at the wrong time, man.

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:55.851
You want to come clean or
you want me to make a mess?

01:04:56.352 --> 01:04:57.478
Sir, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

01:04:57.687 --> 01:04:58.980
It was me, it was me,
it was me, it was me.

01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:02.692
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:05.319
- Taking it in for scanning?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:10.449
All right. You're good to go.

01:05:10.783 --> 01:05:12.159
I'm literally gonna kill you.

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:15.162
<i>Scanning
in bay three.</i>

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.498
<i>We
took old, alien technology</i>

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:20.459
<i>and made it better in every way.</i>

01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:22.336
<i>Introducing Stinger.</i>

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:26.632
<i>KSI. We make the world.</i>

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:31.137
That is a bad-ass robot.

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:33.264
He kind of looks like you, Bee.

01:05:34.056 --> 01:05:36.475
<i>Here is the past.
And now the future.</i>

01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:37.852
They're trying to build
their own versions.

01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:40.521
Well, at least they're picking
cooler cars than this.

01:05:43.608 --> 01:05:44.609
<i>You talk
to me like that?</i>

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:45.776
Bee, stop!

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.195
You see what happens
from being a wiseass?

01:05:48.863 --> 01:05:49.947
<i>- Now get out of here.</i>

01:05:50.615 --> 01:05:52.908
<i>Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee,</i>

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:55.077
<i>but better in every way.</i>

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.204
<i>Son of a...</i>

01:05:57.288 --> 01:05:58.623
No, no! You
gotta calm down.

01:05:59.206 --> 01:06:01.000
- He's crazy!
- Stop!

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:03.878
Bumblebee! Bee,
stop going psycho!

01:06:05.713 --> 01:06:07.965
Our factory does not have enough
Transformium for production--

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:10.343
--because you don't keep
your promise to supply it.

01:06:10.676 --> 01:06:13.304
My delicate flower, I can't
understand you when you're angry.

01:06:13.596 --> 01:06:15.514
Actually, I don't really
understand you at all.

01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:17.683
Our entire factory
is up and running...

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:19.393
Excuse me one second. Hey!

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:21.646
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.

01:06:23.314 --> 01:06:25.066
What the hell is going on here?
Huh?

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:26.275
What's with this vintage crap?

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:28.611
We're not scanning
collector car junk.

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:31.405
What do you think it is
that we make here? Hmm?

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:34.033
We make poetry. We're poets.

01:06:34.617 --> 01:06:38.079
All right? You work for me, you
get one mistake. One. Understood?

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:39.622
- It won't happen again.
- It certainly won't.

01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:42.291
So let's get this pathetic
thing out of here.

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:43.876
And you, too.

01:06:44.335 --> 01:06:45.586
So sorry. So sorry.

01:06:46.629 --> 01:06:47.797
Let's move on.

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:49.131
Watch him. I'm going to
see what I can find.

01:06:49.465 --> 01:06:50.508
Quietly get out of here.

01:06:51.133 --> 01:06:53.427
I swear. I swear. I can't
bear it when you're angry.

01:06:53.511 --> 01:06:55.054
You know how it upsets me.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.688
Bee, you gotta calm
down right now.

01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:04.772
<i>I'm perfectly calm, dude.</i>

01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:07.274
You gotta breathe, or just do
whatever it is that you do.

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:09.151
<i>I'm calm. I'm calm. I'm
not even touching it.</i>

01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:10.945
<i>Okay, I'm barely touching it.
I'm barely touching it.</i>

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.530
Oh, my God. Turn back
into a car right now!

01:07:12.655 --> 01:07:13.656
<i>Get out of my face, all right?</i>

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:14.824
MALE ANNOUNCER ON
<i>Our design team</i>

01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:16.575
<i>started with the Bumblebee.</i>

01:07:16.659 --> 01:07:19.286
<i>But really, this alien's
design was decrepit</i>

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:20.621
<i>and, let's face it, antique.</i>

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:22.206
<i>What the...</i>

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:24.166
- Don't take it personally, Bee.
<i>- Kind of old and ratty.</i>

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:25.710
<i>You mean ugly.</i>

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.629
<i>- Oh, hell, no!</i>
- No! No!

01:07:28.921 --> 01:07:30.673
<i>You think you're better than me!</i>

01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:33.467
<i>Yee-hah!</i>

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.932
What did you touch?

01:07:40.933 --> 01:07:42.476
Uh...

01:07:42.727 --> 01:07:46.147
<i>I told you,
homeboy Can't touch this</i>

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:48.482
My office in 15 minutes.

01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:50.526
<i>This is
dissection room seven.</i>

01:07:50.609 --> 01:07:53.738
<i>Galvatron, render
postmortem number 12.</i>

01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:57.616
<i>Continued head disfigurement
at event number 32.</i>

01:08:02.872 --> 01:08:04.957
So what about the deal?
Is it done?

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.041
Did you get the Seed?

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:07.543
We get it when the bounty
hunter gets Prime.

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:08.627
Uh-huh.

01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:11.130
Meanwhile, there has
been a complication.

01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:12.465
A what?

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:15.134
No, no.

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:16.886
At KSI, we don't use
words like that.

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:21.599
A civilian harboring the Autobots has
hacked into one of your mini-drones.

01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:24.518
Meaning, they may know
of your involvement.

01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:26.228
What?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.069
That was a little bit intense.

01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:39.450
I need more Transformium, and I need
it now, to build more prototypes.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.161
You tell your alien
bounty hunter

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:46.207
that I have staked my
company on this deal.

01:08:46.499 --> 01:08:48.250
And I have merely
staked my life.

01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:50.711
Hey, you came to me
on this, remember?

01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:52.796
You retire from the CIA,

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.758
you get a seven-figure piece
of my company, and you and I

01:08:56.008 --> 01:08:59.011
revolutionize national
defense together.

01:08:59.345 --> 01:09:03.432
But, Attinger, buddy,
for both our sakes,

01:09:04.683 --> 01:09:06.727
you need to deliver

01:09:07.478 --> 01:09:09.354
the Seed.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.082
<i>I'm in. Can
you see my camera?</i>

01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:31.042
<i>They're melting Ratchet.</i>

01:09:31.836 --> 01:09:34.087
They slaughtered Ratchet!

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:37.341
I'm gonna tear them apart!

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:39.051
Metal.

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:42.470
Just metal. That's what I
always thought of them.

01:09:43.389 --> 01:09:44.390
Well, they're not.

01:09:44.473 --> 01:09:46.392
They're living things,
with souls like ours.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.437
Once, I spoke to one.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:52.982
And you're working
with Transformium?

01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:56.068
Uh, yeah, that's what I do.
I am.

01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:58.821
I'm out there digging for it.
There's just not much left to find.

01:09:59.822 --> 01:10:02.324
So that's how badly you
boys need more, huh?

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:04.118
Reduced to melting evil
old Decepticons down.

01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:08.455
No. That's an Autobot there.

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:10.791
The ones who fought for us.

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:13.460
- I've got this taken care of from here.
- Right.

01:10:13.544 --> 01:10:15.546
Same badge code scanned
at two separate gates.

01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:18.090
I'm having the classified
area locked down now.

01:10:25.806 --> 01:10:26.807
Check that guy.

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.394
Hey!

01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:32.354
Stop right there!

01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:37.693
Stop!

01:10:43.574 --> 01:10:44.742
Freeze!

01:10:47.119 --> 01:10:48.913
Up against the wall.

01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:50.331
All right.

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:55.461
Corporate espionage. That's a
very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:15.689
Wow.

01:11:19.026 --> 01:11:20.736
Look, I want a lawyer.

01:11:20.819 --> 01:11:22.947
The Justice Department.
Somebody I can trust.

01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:24.281
I'm just trying to
protect my family, okay?

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:26.283
Not from your company,
from the government.

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:27.534
Mr. Yeager,

01:11:27.952 --> 01:11:29.495
who do you think I work for?

01:11:30.037 --> 01:11:32.790
You're trying to protect your
family, that's admirable.

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:35.960
I'm trying to defend the
nation from alien war.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:37.252
We've had a taste of
what that looks like,

01:11:37.336 --> 01:11:39.546
and we are not gonna
tolerate another. Now...

01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:44.635
There is a version of this conversation
where you get to go back to your barn,

01:11:44.969 --> 01:11:46.637
your daughter gets to
graduate with honors,

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.181
and life as you
know it will go on.

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:53.519
You have no idea what
you're involved with here.

01:11:55.062 --> 01:11:56.313
Really?

01:11:57.398 --> 01:11:59.483
What's the other version
of this conversation?

01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:02.569
The one when you send in the hired
help to murder my little girl?

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:05.447
Or you gonna man up
and do it yourself?

01:12:08.075 --> 01:12:09.743
What's your preference?

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:12.579
I'm going to ask you this once.

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:14.832
Where is Optimus Prime?

01:12:49.324 --> 01:12:50.743
<i>Come on.
Let's get out of here.</i>

01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:53.120
We're moving. Basement.

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:57.124
They're here.

01:13:00.294 --> 01:13:01.962
Get out! All of you!

01:13:02.046 --> 01:13:03.380
Science fair's
over, meatbags!

01:13:03.464 --> 01:13:04.715
- Destroy the lab!
- Move, move, move, move!

01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:07.217
Look out! Look out!

01:13:08.135 --> 01:13:10.137
Destroy it all!

01:13:12.264 --> 01:13:15.559
Danger! Security breach!
Danger...

01:13:16.268 --> 01:13:17.436
Guys! It's me!

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:19.313
Break me out of this
Frankenstein box!

01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:20.689
Hey!

01:13:20.773 --> 01:13:21.774
Hey!

01:13:23.609 --> 01:13:24.693
Hey!

01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:26.028
Stop!

01:13:26.111 --> 01:13:27.696
That's company property!

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.157
They're not your property!

01:13:32.785 --> 01:13:35.621
They were my friends.

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:41.376
Oh, you ain't talking so much now!
You got Hound in front of you, huh?

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:42.711
Go ahead.

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.797
Show us your true colors,
once and for all.

01:13:45.047 --> 01:13:48.342
Just give me the word,
I'll splatter him.

01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:52.930
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here
that this is all the spoils of war.

01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:54.014
Dead metal.

01:13:55.808 --> 01:13:58.977
Innovation. What we
do here is science.

01:13:59.311 --> 01:14:02.147
Because if we don't do
it, somebody else will.

01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:04.525
Because you cannot
stop technology!

01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:07.820
We're not your technology!

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:14.827
Let me vaporize his ass.

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:19.331
I broke the code. I own
your whole genome.

01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:22.876
The world will know
what you're doing here.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:26.255
The world? The world
will approve.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.882
We can make you now.

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:33.220
Don't you get it? We
don't need you anymore.

01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:36.557
That was cruel.

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:42.771
Autobots,

01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:45.899
we're done.

01:14:46.483 --> 01:14:48.777
We're done? We're not gonna
kick a little bit of ass?

01:14:48.861 --> 01:14:50.904
I've been itching
to kill something lately.

01:14:50.988 --> 01:14:52.656
This is our chance.
We have to stop him.

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:53.866
You have to stop him.

01:14:53.949 --> 01:14:55.325
It's never been
tested in the field.

01:14:55.409 --> 01:14:57.661
Labs, military bases, but
not on civilian streets.

01:14:57.744 --> 01:14:59.371
Down there a Defense
Department contract

01:14:59.454 --> 01:15:01.123
was just attacked in
a terrorist attack.

01:15:01.415 --> 01:15:03.917
This is now a CIA military op.

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:07.379
You're indemnified. Respond!

01:15:12.593 --> 01:15:13.760
Let's go.

01:15:14.845 --> 01:15:17.181
KSI Chicago, closest
live sat, patch it in.

01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:18.724
Been an unprovoked
Autobot attack.

01:15:18.807 --> 01:15:20.517
Bring up Galvatron.

01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:24.938
Transforming Galvatron.

01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:27.441
<i>Galvatron coming online.</i>

01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:31.528
<i>Bring up Stinger.</i>

01:15:32.446 --> 01:15:34.448
<i>Stinger
coming online.</i>

01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:43.957
Let's show these alien terrorists
what an upgrade looks like.

01:15:45.209 --> 01:15:46.627
<i>Galvatron
and Stinger are moving</i>

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:47.878
<i>to intercept targets.</i>

01:15:53.842 --> 01:15:56.595
<i>Reapers. Five
targets in the open. Good picture.</i>

01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:02.601
Two miles to intercept.

01:16:14.196 --> 01:16:15.197
STANDING AIR FORCE
200 meters.

01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:17.532
Engage.

01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:19.117
Transform.

01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:33.173
Whoa.

01:16:44.059 --> 01:16:45.769
We are programming this, right?

01:16:45.852 --> 01:16:47.896
Yes. Mostly.

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.482
<i>Systems
seem to have malfunctioned.</i>

01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:52.651
Targeting five bogeys.

01:16:53.193 --> 01:16:54.695
Engaging rockets.

01:16:54.903 --> 01:16:55.904
Missiles away.

01:17:11.295 --> 01:17:12.504
Gotta haul ass, Bee! Come on!

01:17:16.049 --> 01:17:17.050
<i>Stinger is in pursuit.</i>

01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:30.397
Misfire, misfire!
Misfire, misfire!

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.733
System failure. Galvatron
just fired four rockets.

01:17:32.858 --> 01:17:34.568
Whoa! They're shooting at us!

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.163
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Watch out! What are you doing?

01:18:12.606 --> 01:18:13.940
<i>Argh!</i>

01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:25.118
<i>What was that?</i>

01:18:26.078 --> 01:18:28.288
We need a full medical team now.
Possible civilian casualties.

01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:30.874
I mean, you got a lot of people in
the crossfire here. I don't like...

01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:33.210
You're making history here. For
your country, for the world.

01:18:33.293 --> 01:18:35.337
Human freedom is at stake.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.422
Innocent people
die all the time.

01:18:44.596 --> 01:18:45.639
Come on, Optimus!

01:19:11.498 --> 01:19:12.833
Tessa!

01:19:22.259 --> 01:19:23.927
Make him fight. Don't
let him go down.

01:19:24.177 --> 01:19:25.178
Make him fight!

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.013
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:34.855
Tessa!

01:19:35.981 --> 01:19:36.982
Tessa!

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:38.358
Tessa, run to the field!

01:19:45.449 --> 01:19:47.617
You have no soul!

01:19:48.285 --> 01:19:51.288
That is why I have no fear!

01:19:52.372 --> 01:19:53.623
You die!

01:20:06.386 --> 01:20:07.554
Help me!

01:20:30.744 --> 01:20:31.995
What is that?

01:20:33.038 --> 01:20:36.291
That's my asset.
Pull Galvatron back.

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.667
Do it.

01:21:09.074 --> 01:21:10.075
I got to go get her.

01:21:13.912 --> 01:21:15.080
Tessa!

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:17.707
Don't go out there!
He'll kill you!

01:21:18.083 --> 01:21:19.918
- She needs my help!
- She's hidden!

01:21:20.126 --> 01:21:21.962
Optimus! Optimus,
get up, get up!

01:21:22.212 --> 01:21:24.798
I can't. Get out of here.

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:32.556
I feel sorry for you, Prime.
Your allegiance to these humans.

01:21:32.889 --> 01:21:39.312
The trouble with loyalty to a cause is
that the cause will always betray you.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:42.315
Who sent you here?

01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:44.818
Where do you think
you came from?

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:46.653
You think
you were born?

01:21:47.571 --> 01:21:50.574
No. You were built.

01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:53.618
And your creators want you back.

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:56.830
We all work for someone.

01:22:07.674 --> 01:22:08.675
No, no.

01:22:09.843 --> 01:22:10.844
No.

01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:12.512
It's got her!

01:22:12.637 --> 01:22:13.888
- She's in the car!
- Tessa!

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:15.682
- No!
- Tessa!

01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:22.397
Dad!

01:22:22.731 --> 01:22:24.733
Tessa, get out!

01:22:25.191 --> 01:22:26.860
Get out!

01:22:27.861 --> 01:22:28.945
Tessa!

01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.409
Get out! Tessa!

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:35.619
Dad, help me!

01:22:35.702 --> 01:22:38.413
- Tessa!
- Help me, help me! Dad! Dad!

01:22:43.043 --> 01:22:44.377
Dad!

01:22:44.753 --> 01:22:46.338
- Dad!
- Tessa! Break the glass!

01:22:46.421 --> 01:22:48.590
- Break the glass to get out!
- I'm trying!

01:22:49.215 --> 01:22:50.925
- Tessa, I can't hold on!
- Dad!

01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:52.218
Tessa!

01:22:52.594 --> 01:22:54.596
- Help me!
- Just break it! Break the glass!

01:22:54.804 --> 01:22:55.805
Tess...

01:22:59.601 --> 01:23:01.936
Cade,
warn the Autobots!

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:04.731
Dad, help me! Don't leave me!

01:23:05.565 --> 01:23:07.734
No!

01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:38.765
Take that
human to the trash.

01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:51.611
Mr. Secretary.

01:23:52.737 --> 01:23:56.074
My team is on the way.
This is a CIA operation.

01:23:56.408 --> 01:23:58.702
This is my asset.

01:23:59.035 --> 01:24:01.621
Tell the military to stand down.

01:24:01.746 --> 01:24:02.997
Hang on, I have the White House.

01:24:03.331 --> 01:24:04.332
<i>Agent, hello!</i>

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:05.542
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:07.961
Boy, is it a flurry of excitement
over here at the White House.

01:24:08.044 --> 01:24:10.380
Everybody is super, super mad.
At me.

01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:12.298
So, I went over my notes
from our last meeting,

01:24:12.382 --> 01:24:15.218
and I'm not sure when
you said anything about

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:17.095
a "giant alien warship
over Michigan Avenue."

01:24:17.303 --> 01:24:19.472
Tell the President
this is not an attack.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.232
Remember this ship, Prime?

01:24:29.315 --> 01:24:32.068
Built for all you Knights,
you great crusaders,

01:24:32.152 --> 01:24:34.320
to explore the universe.

01:24:34.404 --> 01:24:38.324
Well, I commandeered it.
It's my personal prison now.

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:35.632
Optimus?

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:46.601
Welcome back to the
Knights' Temenos, Prime.

01:25:47.936 --> 01:25:51.022
You have disgraced it.

01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:59.781
Join your fellow
rebels, fugitive scum.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.868
It's for the rarest of specimens.
The worst of the worst.

01:26:03.952 --> 01:26:05.370
It's taken centuries,

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:09.833
but I've collected all
the Knights but you.

01:26:17.465 --> 01:26:20.969
The creators want to sweep
their chessboard clean.

01:26:23.847 --> 01:26:27.308
I'm slave to no one.

01:26:28.977 --> 01:26:32.480
All this species
mixing with species.

01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:35.358
It upsets the cosmic balance.

01:26:35.567 --> 01:26:37.735
The creators, they
don't like it.

01:26:38.152 --> 01:26:42.156
They built you to do
what you were told.

01:26:44.492 --> 01:26:45.827
Why hasn't
it taken off yet?

01:26:45.952 --> 01:26:47.620
Come on, Bee, it's descending.
You got to get on it!

01:26:48.538 --> 01:26:50.206
<i>Savoy,
mission accomplished.</i>

01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:53.126
<i>Lockdown has Prime. The
deal's going down now.</i>

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:54.961
Picking up the Seed
at the recon point.

01:27:09.434 --> 01:27:11.769
<i>Nest, Talon.
L.Z. appears clear.</i>

01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:35.126
Much as I've
enjoyed the hunt,

01:27:35.335 --> 01:27:37.921
I won't miss your
wretched planet.

01:27:38.004 --> 01:27:41.215
Our deal is done. One
Prime for one Seed.

01:27:43.676 --> 01:27:45.678
Handle it with care.

01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:51.476
I trust your species is ready.

01:27:51.851 --> 01:27:53.645
Don't worry about our species.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.606
Farewell, Earth.

01:28:06.699 --> 01:28:08.201
Come on, come on!

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:21.381
Bee, come on!

01:28:22.757 --> 01:28:26.886
It's a bad idea. But I'm
all about bad ideas.

01:28:27.637 --> 01:28:28.972
Let's go!

01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:32.266
Well, let's rock.

01:28:51.953 --> 01:28:53.121
This is crazy.

01:28:53.204 --> 01:28:54.706
Look, you wanna cut and
run, you better do it now.

01:28:54.789 --> 01:28:56.124
I'm gonna die trying.

01:28:56.666 --> 01:28:58.876
Hey, I'm not here to help
you get your daughter.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.503
You're here to help
me get my girlfriend.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:06.592
Engage dark-matter drives.
Full power.

01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:18.354
We're behind
enemy lines now.

01:29:18.438 --> 01:29:21.691
Lockdown's ship has booby traps.
Eyes open.

01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:24.652
Beware of his bone grinders,
brain blinders, flesh peelers,

01:29:24.736 --> 01:29:25.737
chromosomal inverters,

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:29.323
catatonic sludge, black hole
trapdoors, and, of course, radiation.

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:32.368
We must be quick. We have
the element of surprise.

01:29:32.452 --> 01:29:35.163
Let's try to use violence
as a last resort.

01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:37.957
Oh, get it!

01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:39.208
I kill you! Kill you!

01:29:39.542 --> 01:29:40.877
Ugh. I
hate those things.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.337
- That's freaky.
- He's not alive anymore.

01:29:43.421 --> 01:29:45.840
Well, we looked. They're not here.
Let's go.

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:48.259
What? Hey, I'm not going
anywhere without Tessa.

01:29:48.718 --> 01:29:50.887
I'm unclear. What's
in it for me?

01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:52.930
What's in it for you?

01:29:53.973 --> 01:29:56.309
Easy. Let's use words.

01:29:56.642 --> 01:29:59.562
What's in it for you
is I don't kill you.

01:29:59.645 --> 01:30:03.107
We're getting the boss back.
And the girl. Copy?

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.071
Okay, okay. Very persuasive.
Textbook machismo.

01:30:08.279 --> 01:30:10.990
Well, then. We'll need
to sabotage something.

01:30:11.324 --> 01:30:14.911
Better hurry. Because dark-matter
drives are preparing to take off.

01:30:15.161 --> 01:30:17.413
- Oh, wonderful.
- I give us 10 minutes.

01:30:17.497 --> 01:30:19.582
Is that what that sound is?
The engines filling up?

01:30:19.665 --> 01:30:21.167
Are you telling me that
thing's gonna be...

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:23.044
This is gonna be flying out
of here in 10 minutes?

01:30:23.252 --> 01:30:24.253
Uh-huh.
- Ten minutes?

01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:25.671
Could be nine.
Worst case, seven.

01:30:25.755 --> 01:30:27.965
- Humans, search the cell blocks.
- We're wasting time, let's go.

01:30:28.049 --> 01:30:30.259
- We'll find the center core.
- Let's move.

01:30:30.593 --> 01:30:32.428
We're gonna stop
this nightmare ship.

01:30:47.777 --> 01:30:49.654
We're never gonna
find her in this huge ship.

01:30:49.737 --> 01:30:51.656
Like a needle in a haystack.

01:30:52.615 --> 01:30:53.950
Tessa!

01:30:55.159 --> 01:30:56.494
Great. Great.

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:00.665
Oh, that was smooth.

01:31:00.748 --> 01:31:03.459
No, that was really smooth, letting
everybody know we're here.

01:31:03.543 --> 01:31:05.211
Now they're gonna
be looking for us.

01:31:13.219 --> 01:31:17.390
Better hurry, Crosshairs,
before we go into space!

01:31:17.723 --> 01:31:20.059
Ah. Here's the little
jujube right here.

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:23.437
Hello, Mama.

01:31:35.575 --> 01:31:37.743
Who fired the anchors?

01:31:41.789 --> 01:31:44.917
Who's on my ship? We
have a loose prisoner.

01:31:48.963 --> 01:31:51.340
Hurry up. We got
like six minutes.

01:31:51.424 --> 01:31:52.466
We'll find her.

01:31:54.594 --> 01:31:55.720
Hold up.

01:31:59.098 --> 01:32:00.308
Back up.

01:32:03.352 --> 01:32:05.146
Come on, these things are gonna find us.
Hurry, hide.

01:32:54.153 --> 01:32:55.321
Whoa!

01:33:01.661 --> 01:33:02.662
Weapons!

01:33:03.454 --> 01:33:05.623
Come here. Help me.
Hurry, hurry.

01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:12.964
Help me up.

01:33:13.381 --> 01:33:15.549
There are some weird
sounds out there.

01:33:59.552 --> 01:34:02.054
- What is that?
- I don't know.

01:34:02.388 --> 01:34:03.514
You ready?

01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:04.932
Run.

01:34:09.895 --> 01:34:10.980
Oh!

01:34:14.233 --> 01:34:15.568
All right, we're not going
down without a fight.

01:34:18.738 --> 01:34:20.406
They turn that corner, and
we're gonna take them.

01:34:20.489 --> 01:34:21.490
You ready or you gonna
bitch out on me?

01:34:21.574 --> 01:34:22.616
No, I got your back.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:23.951
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

01:34:26.912 --> 01:34:28.080
Don't bitch out on me.
Are you ready?

01:34:28.205 --> 01:34:29.332
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:34:29.915 --> 01:34:32.918
Whoa, okay! I surrender! I surrender!
I surrender!

01:34:38.466 --> 01:34:40.343
I'm so sorry! I'm
so, so, so sorry!

01:34:40.593 --> 01:34:41.677
What'd you do?
How'd you do that?

01:34:41.844 --> 01:34:42.970
I have no idea!

01:34:43.179 --> 01:34:45.681
You no-good, chickenshit
little rat!

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.309
Look at that. You see that? Oh!

01:34:48.392 --> 01:34:49.477
Whoa!

01:34:50.644 --> 01:34:52.271
You stay here, Lucky Charms!

01:35:10.623 --> 01:35:13.626
Oh, man. I am so gonna
patent this shit.

01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:27.681
Ew!

01:35:28.307 --> 01:35:29.642
Tess!

01:35:30.142 --> 01:35:32.478
Dad! Help me!

01:35:32.812 --> 01:35:33.938
Hey!

01:35:34.021 --> 01:35:35.398
- Tess?
- Tess!

01:35:41.112 --> 01:35:42.321
Come on, move, move!

01:35:43.572 --> 01:35:44.615
Tessa!

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.368
Shane, I love you! I love you!
You saved me! You saved me!

01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:48.452
I know. I know.

01:35:50.162 --> 01:35:51.997
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:35:52.623 --> 01:35:55.459
- Thank you. You saved me.
- Oh, yeah, he saved you. Yeah.

01:35:55.668 --> 01:35:56.794
Yeah.

01:35:57.002 --> 01:35:59.422
I think you and Mr. "I Surrender" have
a lot to catch up about, sweetie.

01:35:59.672 --> 01:36:01.215
He saved me, too. You should
have seen him in there.

01:36:01.298 --> 01:36:04.510
I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now.

01:36:04.885 --> 01:36:07.054
- Eyes open.
- I almost got it.

01:36:07.763 --> 01:36:10.099
Big boy coming through!
Move, move, move.

01:36:10.182 --> 01:36:11.225
Whoa!

01:36:11.725 --> 01:36:15.563
This has got to be the Supermax.
Watch the corners.

01:36:15.855 --> 01:36:17.523
There's a lot of cages.

01:36:17.648 --> 01:36:19.692
Oh, yeah. Creepy
critters in here.

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.194
I don't want to
know what's in the big cage.

01:36:22.528 --> 01:36:24.989
- What's this?
- Hound, don't do it.

01:36:25.072 --> 01:36:27.450
Aw, you don't look very
dangerous in there.

01:36:28.451 --> 01:36:31.662
Oh, that's festering ugliness.

01:36:32.455 --> 01:36:34.665
I'm hit! I'm down! It's melting!

01:36:34.748 --> 01:36:35.749
It burns!

01:36:37.126 --> 01:36:38.627
Ugh, I think it's acid!

01:36:38.711 --> 01:36:43.090
Ah, nuts. It's just shizzle.

01:36:43.174 --> 01:36:45.009
I hope that's not contagious.

01:36:45.092 --> 01:36:48.053
I got to hurt you now. You're
just too disturbing to live.

01:36:48.804 --> 01:36:50.139
Take that, bitch!

01:36:51.807 --> 01:36:53.100
Oh! You're dead.

01:36:53.476 --> 01:36:55.436
- Hound!
- He's alive!

01:36:55.644 --> 01:36:56.812
Hold on,
boss, we're coming!

01:36:56.896 --> 01:36:59.064
- Optimus, sound off!
- In here, quick!

01:36:59.148 --> 01:37:00.483
Hang on, we're coming for you!

01:37:00.566 --> 01:37:02.318
The arms of this
Knight Ship detach!

01:37:02.401 --> 01:37:05.362
We can break free! It's
a separate ship! Hurry!

01:37:05.446 --> 01:37:06.822
Where's the cockpit?
Right or left?

01:37:06.906 --> 01:37:08.199
- Right!
- I'm on it, boss.

01:37:08.282 --> 01:37:10.326
Hurry. We have no time.

01:37:10.409 --> 01:37:11.410
<i>Sensei.</i>

01:37:11.827 --> 01:37:15.331
Let's rock! I always wanted
to fly one of these things.

01:37:15.414 --> 01:37:16.749
I'm there, boss!

01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:21.504
Hey, Yeager Technologies,

01:37:21.712 --> 01:37:23.964
you gonna invent us a
way out of this one?

01:37:28.511 --> 01:37:30.137
Oh!

01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:33.432
Whoa. Oh, my God.

01:37:34.558 --> 01:37:35.935
I am not doing this.

01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:38.103
- I am not doing that.
- Yes, we are.

01:37:39.188 --> 01:37:41.232
No, it's good. It's stable.
Come on.

01:37:41.649 --> 01:37:42.942
No way.

01:37:43.234 --> 01:37:44.860
Sweetie, you know why I'm here?
I'm here to protect you.

01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:46.111
You've done great at that.

01:37:46.487 --> 01:37:48.489
I want you to trust me right now.
We're getting down. Let's go.

01:37:53.244 --> 01:37:57.706
Don't look down, okay? Step.
See, it's easy. Come on.

01:38:00.459 --> 01:38:02.795
Careful, these cables are
starting to get thinner here!

01:38:03.128 --> 01:38:05.714
- Step. Step. There.
- Oh, my God!

01:38:05.798 --> 01:38:08.425
See, don't look down! All right?
Don't look down.

01:38:08.634 --> 01:38:10.803
We're gonna be at the
building in no time!

01:38:12.054 --> 01:38:13.264
You okay, Tess?

01:38:14.181 --> 01:38:15.266
Keep stepping.

01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:18.185
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Dad! Oh!

01:38:22.439 --> 01:38:25.276
All right, sweetie. You need
to keep moving here, okay?

01:38:25.859 --> 01:38:27.111
- Come on!
- I can't.

01:38:27.528 --> 01:38:29.029
I'm freaking out.

01:38:29.238 --> 01:38:30.239
You need to move now!

01:38:30.864 --> 01:38:33.826
I'm not moving! I'm
going back to the ship!

01:38:36.829 --> 01:38:37.871
Oh, shit!

01:38:38.539 --> 01:38:39.832
You can't go back
to the ship, honey!

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.041
Watch me!

01:38:41.333 --> 01:38:43.168
You are not 18 years old yet and
you're gonna do what I say!

01:38:43.252 --> 01:38:44.253
Now let's go!

01:38:51.218 --> 01:38:54.388
We need to go this way, okay.
Not that way.

01:38:54.638 --> 01:38:55.889
Talk to her, Romeo! Now!

01:38:56.181 --> 01:38:57.182
Come on, for God's sake.

01:38:57.558 --> 01:38:58.809
Do not start with me.

01:39:03.897 --> 01:39:05.357
Oh, my God, what is that?

01:39:05.649 --> 01:39:06.650
All right, Tessa.

01:39:07.192 --> 01:39:08.402
Don't look back.

01:39:08.527 --> 01:39:10.696
Well, don't say that to me.
Now I want to turn around.

01:39:10.904 --> 01:39:12.239
It's nothing major, sweetie.

01:39:12.531 --> 01:39:14.116
Well, that means
it's totally major!

01:39:14.366 --> 01:39:15.618
I'm gonna have to point
this gun in your direction.

01:39:15.701 --> 01:39:18.245
It's gonna feel like it's in
your direction, but I'm not.

01:39:19.788 --> 01:39:21.582
- You better hurry.
- Are you trying to kill me?

01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:23.459
I had to bust my ass to get
up here on this spaceship!

01:39:23.709 --> 01:39:25.210
- Shoot it!
- Get down now!

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.025
Tessa, wait! I'm coming for you!
Tessa! Oh!

01:39:58.327 --> 01:40:00.329
- Oh, my God!
- I'm coming!

01:40:00.829 --> 01:40:02.164
Hold on!

01:40:25.521 --> 01:40:27.439
You're the best, Bee!
You are the best.

01:40:27.523 --> 01:40:29.858
<i>You damn right! And
don't ever forget it.</i>

01:40:29.942 --> 01:40:32.236
You see that? Look at me!
We're off the ship, right?

01:40:32.611 --> 01:40:34.863
Bumblebee!
Bumblebee! Friendly!

01:40:35.197 --> 01:40:38.867
Enemy ships are coming in hot.
Get on! Get on!

01:40:42.913 --> 01:40:43.997
Oh!

01:40:49.002 --> 01:40:51.004
Hold your knickers,
I'm punching it!

01:41:02.182 --> 01:41:03.183
They got three ships on them!

01:41:03.475 --> 01:41:05.519
I'm giving it the juice!

01:41:09.148 --> 01:41:11.525
Come on, Bee, take them out!

01:41:16.822 --> 01:41:17.823
Good move, Bee!

01:41:18.157 --> 01:41:20.534
This one's for you, A-holes!

01:41:34.673 --> 01:41:36.008
If you're gonna do
something, you better do it!

01:41:36.258 --> 01:41:37.676
Come on!

01:41:39.344 --> 01:41:42.806
I'm sick of this crap.
You fly. I shoot.

01:41:43.849 --> 01:41:45.976
Hey, you better let me
fire this big-ass gun

01:41:46.059 --> 01:41:47.561
- and make this ship go faster!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:52.065
Listen up! Crash course.
Tracer guns.

01:41:52.399 --> 01:41:55.110
Punch forward to fire,
slide back to reload.

01:41:55.194 --> 01:41:56.195
What?

01:41:56.361 --> 01:41:58.238
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

01:41:58.322 --> 01:41:59.782
Wait. What're you talking about?

01:41:59.865 --> 01:42:01.074
- I don't know what he means.
- Good luck.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.743
Where are you going?

01:42:03.035 --> 01:42:04.286
To lay some hate.

01:42:14.379 --> 01:42:15.339
- Say it!
- Okay.

01:42:15.422 --> 01:42:16.507
Punch, hold,
slide, repeat.

01:42:16.715 --> 01:42:17.883
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:19.051
Go!

01:42:31.063 --> 01:42:32.064
Yeah, I got one! Whoo!

01:42:34.024 --> 01:42:35.275
These alien guns kick ass!

01:42:38.612 --> 01:42:40.030
Come on, he's on us!

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.657
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!

01:42:44.993 --> 01:42:46.662
Bee, fire the gun!

01:42:58.090 --> 01:42:59.508
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

01:42:59.591 --> 01:43:00.592
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:43:10.894 --> 01:43:12.104
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:16.984
That was insane!

01:43:17.317 --> 01:43:19.278
Tess, you okay?

01:43:27.786 --> 01:43:29.663
Okay. Sir?

01:43:32.457 --> 01:43:34.167
You better have insurance!

01:43:36.461 --> 01:43:37.796
Insurance?

01:43:38.463 --> 01:43:39.673
It's a freaking spaceship.

01:43:40.173 --> 01:43:41.800
You go get insurance on
a freaking spaceship.

01:43:41.967 --> 01:43:42.968
Good luck with that, buddy.

01:43:44.136 --> 01:43:46.221
Is this your car? Huh?

01:43:49.558 --> 01:43:51.476
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:52.811
Here you go.

01:43:54.104 --> 01:43:55.105
Come here.

01:43:55.814 --> 01:43:57.691
- Trust your dad.
- Okay.

01:44:04.531 --> 01:44:07.659
Prepare for interstellar launch.

01:44:15.667 --> 01:44:17.794
We're almost ready to separate.
We're almost there.

01:44:17.878 --> 01:44:19.963
- Hurry, he's launching!
- All over it, chief.

01:44:20.047 --> 01:44:23.175
Lockdown will be in deep space
before he realizes I'm gone.

01:44:23.258 --> 01:44:25.677
I'm a sucky pilot, but
let's give it a whirl.

01:44:25.761 --> 01:44:27.179
Hell, yeah!

01:44:35.896 --> 01:44:37.814
You CIA guys are really subtle.

01:44:38.190 --> 01:44:40.609
What a deft hand. I'm sure
nobody noticed all that.

01:44:41.026 --> 01:44:43.695
Look. In a few minutes, there are
gonna be feds all over this place,

01:44:43.904 --> 01:44:45.948
and I don't want them
finding our Holy Grail.

01:44:46.156 --> 01:44:49.159
So we're gonna take all our R&D, we're
moving it to our China facility.

01:44:49.242 --> 01:44:50.285
Yeah.

01:44:50.369 --> 01:44:54.039
I want you to bring me the Seed, but
I want you to bring it to me there.

01:44:54.373 --> 01:44:59.378
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe
your product testing as perfected.

01:44:59.628 --> 01:45:01.922
We have plenty of time for
improvements in China.

01:45:02.673 --> 01:45:05.842
Sir, Galvatron. He was...

01:45:05.926 --> 01:45:07.135
A fiasco.

01:45:07.552 --> 01:45:10.180
A farrago. An embarrassment.

01:45:10.889 --> 01:45:13.183
And he spoke. How
did that happen?

01:45:13.266 --> 01:45:14.851
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley?
A flaw?

01:45:15.227 --> 01:45:18.563
A flaw is a total failure.

01:45:18.897 --> 01:45:23.902
I did not have control over my
prototype, and I want to know why!

01:45:42.004 --> 01:45:46.216
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.
We got a ship now. We're leaving.

01:45:47.009 --> 01:45:50.679
You humans. After
all we have done.

01:45:51.013 --> 01:45:53.515
You don't know what you've
wrought upon yourselves.

01:45:53.849 --> 01:45:55.851
What? What is it now?
What are you talking about?

01:45:55.934 --> 01:45:57.728
I mean, I'm doing stuff
out of my league here!

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:01.189
You don't see who's
controlling who.

01:46:01.398 --> 01:46:04.067
Within that manmade
prototype I fought,

01:46:04.526 --> 01:46:07.029
I sensed the presence

01:46:07.362 --> 01:46:08.697
of Megatron.

01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:11.992
What, the Decepticon that
started the Chicago war?

01:46:12.325 --> 01:46:15.203
How do you think KSI built those
bots in the first place, hmm?

01:46:15.287 --> 01:46:16.747
They had a whole mess of

01:46:16.913 --> 01:46:20.000
<i>dead Decepticon heads and they
were downloading their minds!</i>

01:46:20.292 --> 01:46:22.210
<i>And I was in charge
of autopsy duty.</i>

01:46:22.335 --> 01:46:25.047
<i>No union, no benefits,
no nothing.</i>

01:46:25.505 --> 01:46:26.965
<i>They hooked me up to Megatron,</i>

01:46:27.132 --> 01:46:29.217
<i>and that mind wasn't as
dead as they thought.</i>

01:46:29.301 --> 01:46:31.386
<i>He fed them the
science and specs!</i>

01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:34.264
<i>All so they could build
him a brand-new body.</i>

01:46:35.515 --> 01:46:38.935
<i>Then he infected it with his
evil, nasty chromosomes.</i>

01:46:40.645 --> 01:46:44.149
<i>They had red, beady eyes.</i>
<i>They got all in my lovely locks.</i>

01:46:44.232 --> 01:46:45.650
<i>Oh, I can smell it right now.</i>

01:46:45.984 --> 01:46:47.986
<i>Total inside custom job!</i>

01:46:49.738 --> 01:46:53.408
KSI might have named the body
the snappy name of Galvatron,

01:46:53.492 --> 01:46:56.328
but that's just
Megatron reincarnated!

01:46:56.661 --> 01:46:58.330
You knew this and you
didn't warn them?

01:46:58.413 --> 01:47:02.751
Little girl, you can go to a pretty
dark place when you on death row.

01:47:02.834 --> 01:47:05.337
He's been playing
KSI all this time,

01:47:05.962 --> 01:47:09.174
all so that he could manipulate
them into going after the Seed.

01:47:11.176 --> 01:47:12.302
Wait. The Seed?

01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:14.846
Those nasty soldiers
that were chasing us.

01:47:15.013 --> 01:47:16.056
<i>I saw them board the ship,</i>

01:47:16.139 --> 01:47:18.517
<i>and they took something
that they called the Seed.</i>

01:47:18.683 --> 01:47:21.436
Listen. Sixty million years
ago, give or take an eon...

01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:25.107
Thousands of planets were
cyber-formed with Seeds.

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:33.406
<i>They turned your organic life
into our elemental metals.</i>

01:47:34.658 --> 01:47:39.287
<i>Our creators destroyed
your world to make us.</i>

01:47:39.913 --> 01:47:42.624
And that's what Galvatron
wants to happen again.

01:47:42.958 --> 01:47:46.962
He wants to detonate that Seed in
the biggest city and kill millions!

01:47:47.087 --> 01:47:49.923
He's gonna show the
world, "Baby, I'm back."

01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:54.761
The blast wave will incinerate
that city into molten metal.

01:47:55.095 --> 01:47:58.056
He'll have enough to
build a massive army

01:47:58.306 --> 01:48:01.935
and annihilate your
species forever.

01:48:02.227 --> 01:48:05.021
You dumb, greedy bastards just
brought extinction to yourself.

01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:07.816
- Not my problem, though.
-  I'm free at last.

01:48:07.899 --> 01:48:10.110
Whole thing worked out good for me.
I'm walking.

01:48:10.193 --> 01:48:12.571
We got to get the Seed
before Galvatron does.

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:30.088
<i>The Seed is going to be
the salvation of our company.</i>

01:48:31.089 --> 01:48:32.966
We take delivery tonight.

01:48:33.258 --> 01:48:36.136
And next month, we detonate
safely in the Mongolian desert.

01:48:36.636 --> 01:48:40.599
And we'll create enough
Transformium for a hundred years.

01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:48.023
Dad, I'm tired of
running and stealing.

01:48:48.106 --> 01:48:49.816
Well, a place to sleep.

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.943
Yeah. Just another break-in.

01:48:57.616 --> 01:48:58.950
You know, when
I was your age,

01:48:59.993 --> 01:49:02.954
I liked to get a little wild.
I liked cars, girls.

01:49:07.167 --> 01:49:08.835
But then there was Tessa.

01:49:09.419 --> 01:49:11.254
And when she was born, all
I ever wanted out of life

01:49:11.338 --> 01:49:13.423
was for her to be happy
and healthy and safe.

01:49:14.591 --> 01:49:17.427
Somehow I thought I'd always
be enough to protect her.

01:49:19.387 --> 01:49:20.889
But I won't be.

01:49:21.306 --> 01:49:22.807
I'll never be.

01:49:24.476 --> 01:49:26.311
So somebody better be.

01:49:31.274 --> 01:49:33.151
Thanks for being here
today, Lucky Charms.

01:49:36.404 --> 01:49:38.823
Well, thanks for not shooting
me when you had the chance.

01:49:39.282 --> 01:49:40.408
Oh, I'll have more.

01:49:42.452 --> 01:49:44.120
Yeah, I can see that.

01:49:45.038 --> 01:49:48.166
We've intercepted the
encrypted communications.

01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:52.837
Joshua Joyce is headed to his
factory in Guangzhou, China.

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:55.006
Hey, big shot.

01:49:56.299 --> 01:49:58.260
Your company's in
serious trouble.

01:49:58.426 --> 01:50:00.095
You better have a
damn good lawyer.

01:50:00.178 --> 01:50:01.179
<i>Really?</i>

01:50:01.513 --> 01:50:02.472
Well, you better have
a great one 'cause

01:50:02.555 --> 01:50:05.100
you're about to be responsible
for the annihilation of a city.

01:50:05.183 --> 01:50:06.393
<i>Now, you listen to me.</i>

01:50:06.476 --> 01:50:08.728
<i>Your tech has been hacked.
Your prototypes are infected.</i>

01:50:08.937 --> 01:50:11.106
And now Galvatron
is after that Seed.

01:50:11.356 --> 01:50:14.609
<i>Look. I know you have a conscience
because you're an inventor, like me.</i>

01:50:14.693 --> 01:50:17.612
<i>Do not let Galvatron
anywhere near that Seed.</i>

01:50:17.696 --> 01:50:20.156
I control Galvatron.
I created him.

01:50:20.865 --> 01:50:22.325
Deep down, I know you know.

01:50:23.451 --> 01:50:25.829
<i>Your prototype's been
controlling you.</i>

01:50:29.499 --> 01:50:31.710
How fast can that thing get
us halfway around the world?

01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:35.088
Very. It's a spaceship.

01:50:51.938 --> 01:50:55.025
If we're traveling,
now's the time.

01:50:56.568 --> 01:50:59.446
All I want is to have our life back.
It's your call. Whatever you want.

01:51:05.452 --> 01:51:07.746
Are we safer on our own,
or are we safer with them?

01:51:17.047 --> 01:51:18.548
She's a keeper.

01:51:19.257 --> 01:51:20.467
Must take after her mom.

01:51:22.135 --> 01:51:24.262
I can't argue with that, kid.

01:51:25.472 --> 01:51:28.516
Move! We're retrieving the Seed,

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.686
but then we're done
defending the humans.

01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:34.230
What, done? What do you
mean, you're done?

01:51:34.314 --> 01:51:37.484
Means "finished,"
"see ya," "good-bye."

01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:55.752
Hijacked part of my ship? How
did you let this happen?

01:51:55.835 --> 01:51:59.047
Shut down dark-matter drive,
reverse course at light speed,

01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:00.548
and get us back!

01:52:00.882 --> 01:52:03.635
Prime's taken my trophy case.

01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:06.596
And he will feel my wrath!

01:52:14.187 --> 01:52:15.522
Welcome to China.

01:52:15.814 --> 01:52:18.691
Put Galvatron in containment. Tell
the techs do not activate him.

01:52:18.775 --> 01:52:19.818
Absolutely, sir.

01:52:20.110 --> 01:52:21.986
I want security on high alert.

01:52:25.073 --> 01:52:26.408
Joyce.

01:52:26.699 --> 01:52:30.829
I cannot tell you how enthused
I am to deliver this.

01:52:33.373 --> 01:52:35.708
Top of your alien wish list.

01:52:36.084 --> 01:52:39.087
It's yours. Or rather ours.

01:52:41.548 --> 01:52:43.466
I will need to see my advance.

01:52:43.883 --> 01:52:46.469
Five million
shares of the company.

01:52:46.553 --> 01:52:48.138
Together, we're gonna
end human warfare.

01:52:48.930 --> 01:52:51.433
<i>We're about to build a
fully automated U.S. Army.</i>

01:52:51.516 --> 01:52:54.352
<i>Just think of all the American
lives we're gonna save.</i>

01:53:03.945 --> 01:53:08.825
All of these cars are KSI's
newest civilian prototype robots.

01:53:09.242 --> 01:53:11.578
So how soon until we can
start continuous production?

01:53:23.047 --> 01:53:27.385
You know, why don't we take a
beat on this for a minute?

01:53:28.178 --> 01:53:30.847
I have some new data
that I discovered and...

01:53:31.055 --> 01:53:32.056
You're not backing
out on me here?

01:53:32.223 --> 01:53:33.766
No, I'm not backing out.
I just...

01:53:34.017 --> 01:53:36.144
I want the Seed. I'm not
saying I don't want the Seed.

01:53:36.227 --> 01:53:38.396
I'm just saying I
don't know if I...

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.565
If I want the Seed right now.

01:53:40.899 --> 01:53:44.235
Good men have died trying
to get that thing for us.

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.403
For you.

01:53:45.904 --> 01:53:47.989
I know what you did
to get that thing.

01:53:48.072 --> 01:53:50.033
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

01:53:50.408 --> 01:53:53.244
I can take you down, too, Mr. Black Ops.
Don't you threaten me.

01:53:54.245 --> 01:53:56.372
I started this company
when I was a boy,

01:53:56.456 --> 01:53:59.125
with a dream of making the
world a better place.

01:53:59.209 --> 01:54:01.878
Funny. I had the same dream.

01:54:02.587 --> 01:54:06.049
Somewhere along the way, you
made billions of dollars.

01:54:06.424 --> 01:54:08.426
So why don't you tell me
what's missing from my dream?

01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:11.095
Why don't you tell me what's
missing from my boyhood dream?

01:54:12.722 --> 01:54:17.101
I have served my country for
decades of unparalleled prosperity

01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:19.979
and you are my golden parachute.

01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:23.816
So you are damn well jumping
out of the plane with me!

01:54:34.953 --> 01:54:37.539
I am Galvatron!

01:54:43.461 --> 01:54:46.214
- What's going on?
- Your Galvatron has gone active.

01:54:47.632 --> 01:54:49.092
What haven't you
been telling me?

01:54:49.175 --> 01:54:52.136
Find Darcy, and bring a car
around downstairs. Quietly.

01:54:53.388 --> 01:54:55.640
We got a factory emergency. I
have to get you out of here.

01:54:55.974 --> 01:54:57.809
- What the hell's going on?
- Take them outside.

01:54:58.101 --> 01:55:00.144
We had a deal. You
got what you wanted.

01:55:00.979 --> 01:55:02.647
I got what "it" wanted.

01:55:04.148 --> 01:55:08.653
My brothers, today I
grant you your freedom.

01:55:09.112 --> 01:55:13.825
And from now on, you
are commanded by me.

01:55:14.784 --> 01:55:16.119
Rise up!

01:55:18.162 --> 01:55:20.331
Go find my Seed!

01:55:34.679 --> 01:55:38.016
Detonate the Seed in
the largest city.

01:55:40.018 --> 01:55:41.894
Listen, princess. I don't
wanna hear, "I told you so,"

01:55:41.978 --> 01:55:43.730
but this is much more
dangerous than I think.

01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.064
Get in.

01:55:51.696 --> 01:55:53.281
Galvatron's hacked
into the others.

01:55:53.364 --> 01:55:54.824
- What?
- Joshua.

01:55:54.907 --> 01:55:56.492
- You have to contain this!
- Drive, drive!

01:55:56.868 --> 01:55:58.036
Son of a...

01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:03.041
Come on. Let's move,
let's move, let's move!

01:56:18.931 --> 01:56:20.725
I know how to lose
them in Hong Kong.

01:56:21.059 --> 01:56:23.561
I know a military garrison
there that will help us.

01:56:24.771 --> 01:56:27.106
Threatening a
professional CIA killer.

01:56:28.066 --> 01:56:30.860
Possibly not my finest hour. I'd
like to have that one back.

01:56:30.943 --> 01:56:33.112
Killer? I thought they
were your friends!

01:56:33.321 --> 01:56:36.157
No. Not friends. Business.
They gave me this bomb.

01:56:36.449 --> 01:56:38.034
- Bomb?
- Oh!

01:56:38.117 --> 01:56:39.494
Is there a bomb in the bag?

01:56:39.577 --> 01:56:41.663
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

01:56:41.746 --> 01:56:42.830
Shit.

01:56:53.257 --> 01:56:55.009
<i>When you said you were
done fighting for humans,</i>

01:56:55.093 --> 01:56:57.220
you didn't mean that, did you?

01:56:57.303 --> 01:57:00.682
How many more of my
kind must be sacrificed

01:57:00.765 --> 01:57:03.101
to atone for your mistakes?

01:57:03.309 --> 01:57:04.519
Well, what do you think
being human means?

01:57:04.602 --> 01:57:05.687
That's what we do.

01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:07.730
We make mistakes.

01:57:08.606 --> 01:57:11.484
And sometimes out of those mistakes
come the most amazing things.

01:57:16.739 --> 01:57:19.909
When I fixed you, it
was for a reward.

01:57:20.243 --> 01:57:23.454
That was it. That was why.
For money.

01:57:24.622 --> 01:57:26.833
And it was me making a mistake.

01:57:27.583 --> 01:57:29.836
Without it, you
wouldn't be here.

01:57:32.630 --> 01:57:36.300
So even if you got no faith in us,
I'm asking you to do what I do.

01:57:36.592 --> 01:57:39.262
I'm asking you to look at all
the junk and see the treasure.

01:57:40.263 --> 01:57:44.267
You gotta have faith,
Prime, in who we can be.

01:57:56.195 --> 01:57:58.573
I'm seriously pissed we're
not getting paid for this.

01:57:59.532 --> 01:58:01.868
Well, at least we
get to kill him.

01:58:02.702 --> 01:58:04.871
They're not getting away if I
still got him on satellite.

01:58:05.663 --> 01:58:08.332
Some genius. Thinks he
can outrun the CIA.

01:58:10.168 --> 01:58:11.294
Joshua? Yes?

01:58:11.627 --> 01:58:13.171
How lethal is that bomb?

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.339
Uh, I don't know. Let me check.

01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.306
I love this! This is so good.

01:58:23.389 --> 01:58:24.515
Oh, hang on.

01:58:25.558 --> 01:58:28.394
I'm getting a text from
Il Duce in Hong Kong.

01:58:28.853 --> 01:58:31.230
"Need to know the Seed's
estimated blast range."

01:58:31.314 --> 01:58:32.648
Duh.

01:58:41.991 --> 01:58:45.036
I'll do the diversion! Get
that thing somewhere safe!

01:58:50.833 --> 01:58:52.502
Killers are coming!
Guys, we gotta go!

01:58:53.044 --> 01:58:54.086
Guys, guys...

01:58:54.253 --> 01:58:55.755
- Shut up! Shut up!
- All right! I'm sorry!

01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:56.964
All right, go ahead, go ahead!

01:59:00.092 --> 01:59:02.553
Okay, good? No, don't go! Wait!

01:59:03.429 --> 01:59:06.349
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay.

01:59:06.933 --> 01:59:08.935
I need a raise! I want a raise.

01:59:09.018 --> 01:59:10.186
All right, yes! I'm
sure whatever you want!

01:59:14.774 --> 01:59:15.817
Go, go, go!

01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:19.070
Oh, no!

01:59:21.948 --> 01:59:23.616
Death is on our tail!
Death is on our tail!

01:59:30.957 --> 01:59:33.751
Get out of the way, all of you!
Get out of the way!

01:59:35.878 --> 01:59:37.672
I don't want to die like this.

01:59:53.271 --> 01:59:54.772
Box them in.

02:00:08.619 --> 02:00:09.787
Hurry, hurry! Come, come.

02:00:09.912 --> 02:00:11.706
Okay, yes. I'll follow you anywhere.
You're amazing!

02:00:12.123 --> 02:00:13.666
We're going to get
you to the roof.

02:00:13.749 --> 02:00:14.750
Good, good.

02:00:20.715 --> 02:00:21.799
Go!

02:00:32.435 --> 02:00:34.103
LOL. That's funny.

02:00:34.979 --> 02:00:36.522
I can't... This is
really happening.

02:00:36.814 --> 02:00:40.818
A man, me, who is worth over
20 billion dollars is now

02:00:41.319 --> 02:00:44.822
being chased by CIA assassins.
That's the truth.

02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:48.034
And in the
middle of a robot uprising.

02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:53.789
And I'm carrying what is, in
essence, a tactical nuke.

02:00:54.624 --> 02:00:57.418
And the great thing is I... The
great thing is that I'm...

02:00:57.501 --> 02:00:59.045
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.

02:00:59.378 --> 02:01:00.671
- Just stop it!
- What?

02:01:01.005 --> 02:01:02.673
You need to hide on the
roof of this building.

02:01:03.049 --> 02:01:04.592
I'll get you a
helicopter extraction.

02:01:07.511 --> 02:01:08.721
Okay.

02:01:11.682 --> 02:01:13.017
I like her.

02:01:13.726 --> 02:01:14.727
I find her very attractive.

02:01:16.896 --> 02:01:18.731
He's
definitely around here.

02:01:19.357 --> 02:01:20.358
Come on, come on.

02:01:22.818 --> 02:01:24.320
I got a bike!

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.322
Check in there!

02:01:26.822 --> 02:01:28.824
These are the CIA assassins
I told you about.

02:01:31.285 --> 02:01:32.370
Whoa!

02:01:32.912 --> 02:01:34.455
- Guys.
- Let's go.

02:01:35.748 --> 02:01:36.749
Hello.

02:01:43.464 --> 02:01:44.882
Hey! Okay.

02:01:51.931 --> 02:01:53.307
- Pick it up.
- All right. I'm gonna.

02:02:07.405 --> 02:02:08.447
Wow.

02:02:09.532 --> 02:02:13.160
Wow. Wow, thank you. Wow!
How did you...

02:02:13.452 --> 02:02:15.663
Police training,
prior to my MBA.

02:02:16.539 --> 02:02:17.623
I love you.

02:02:19.083 --> 02:02:20.209
Get to the roof.

02:02:20.501 --> 02:02:21.502
All right, okay.

02:02:52.408 --> 02:02:53.534
Mmm!

02:03:16.432 --> 02:03:19.101
Find my Seed. It's here!

02:03:19.602 --> 02:03:21.812
Those prototypes are
after that bomb.

02:03:30.321 --> 02:03:31.363
No!

02:03:32.198 --> 02:03:34.033
No, no, no, no!

02:03:37.995 --> 02:03:39.288
Who the hell's aboard that?

02:03:39.663 --> 02:03:41.165
Impossible.

02:03:48.839 --> 02:03:53.385
Brothers, it's the Autobots!
Shoot them down!

02:03:58.849 --> 02:03:59.892
Joshua!

02:03:59.975 --> 02:04:01.060
Hey, Baldy!

02:04:01.435 --> 02:04:02.728
Hey, it's me! Hey!

02:04:02.978 --> 02:04:04.063
Bring it over now! Let's go.

02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:06.732
Hurry up, run!

02:04:07.108 --> 02:04:09.026
- Hurry! Come on!
- Let's go! Move it!

02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:11.529
Guys! Come on.
Give it to me now!

02:04:12.196 --> 02:04:13.823
Looks like we
might have company.

02:04:24.041 --> 02:04:25.668
We're hit! We're hit!

02:04:51.652 --> 02:04:54.488
They live,
they talk, we're dead.

02:04:55.239 --> 02:04:57.241
- Kill them all.
- Pleasure.

02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.745
I count ten below!

02:05:02.913 --> 02:05:04.999
I thought you said you had
one prototype get infected.

02:05:05.249 --> 02:05:07.251
Now he's got operational
control of my other 50.

02:05:07.418 --> 02:05:08.502
Come on.

02:05:10.337 --> 02:05:12.423
Climb, climb!

02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.842
Surround them.

02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:22.349
I may have started the apocalypse,
but you brought your family.

02:05:22.433 --> 02:05:24.185
And that's, you know,
terrible parenting.

02:05:24.643 --> 02:05:26.187
Oh, I'm about one second
away from knocking you out,

02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:27.563
taking the bomb, and
just leaving you here.

02:05:27.646 --> 02:05:29.064
Please, do me a favor.

02:05:29.523 --> 02:05:32.026
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?

02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:33.194
- Come on, bitch!
- Come on!

02:05:45.748 --> 02:05:46.957
Evac! Evac!

02:05:47.124 --> 02:05:48.542
We're getting flanked!

02:05:50.211 --> 02:05:51.629
We got company below!

02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:54.423
Oh!

02:05:54.882 --> 02:05:58.594
My fat ass is stuck!
Bee, take the shot!

02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:05.893
Oh!

02:06:08.938 --> 02:06:10.481
- Into the elevator! Get in.
- Okay.

02:06:10.564 --> 02:06:11.607
Come on.

02:06:14.985 --> 02:06:16.403
Get down, get down!

02:06:17.112 --> 02:06:18.489
- - Close the door!
Close the door!

02:06:21.450 --> 02:06:22.952
Won't go! It's not closing!

02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:24.453
There's too much weight.

02:06:24.662 --> 02:06:26.330
- Get back down to Bumblebee!
- Dad, no!

02:06:26.497 --> 02:06:28.916
Hey! You want me!

02:06:39.426 --> 02:06:40.427
Center elevator.

02:06:40.678 --> 02:06:42.012
<i>Center elevator.</i>

02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:47.935
He's gonna be okay.

02:07:01.198 --> 02:07:03.534
Alien bomb! Alien
bomb, coming through!

02:07:03.993 --> 02:07:05.703
Clear the way! Clear the...
Hi, kids.

02:07:05.786 --> 02:07:07.329
Coming through, ladies!

02:07:07.538 --> 02:07:09.748
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies!
Excuse me!

02:07:09.915 --> 02:07:10.916
Oh, my God!

02:07:11.083 --> 02:07:13.043
How do you say, "Get the fuck
out of the way" in Chinese?

02:07:43.949 --> 02:07:45.159
Ahhh!

02:07:57.963 --> 02:08:00.299
That's a long way down.

02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:04.470
You've got to be kidding me.

02:08:06.555 --> 02:08:07.806
No!

02:08:20.486 --> 02:08:21.570
Come on.

02:08:29.370 --> 02:08:30.788
Whoa!

02:08:33.665 --> 02:08:35.000
I'm coming for you!

02:09:10.285 --> 02:09:11.995
Never should have
hidden that truck.

02:09:12.329 --> 02:09:14.081
You should have never
came after my family.

02:09:14.164 --> 02:09:17.000
Tough luck, Yeager.
We all have family.

02:09:17.793 --> 02:09:19.336
Yeah, but I'm gonna
live to see mine.

02:09:43.026 --> 02:09:45.821
<i>Where
is my escaped bounty?</i>

02:09:45.904 --> 02:09:47.698
Autobots at this location.

02:09:48.365 --> 02:09:50.033
Prime is close.

02:09:51.702 --> 02:09:53.412
Do whatever you have to do.

02:09:54.872 --> 02:09:56.373
I intend to.

02:09:58.917 --> 02:10:00.544
- Darcy!
- Joshua!

02:10:00.752 --> 02:10:01.795
We got three more
coming in from that way!

02:10:02.045 --> 02:10:03.672
Bee, where's Tessa?

02:10:04.715 --> 02:10:05.716
Dad!

02:10:08.635 --> 02:10:11.847
We got a real dilemma here. Okay?
I created incredible robots.

02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:14.475
It's all designed to kick
that fat Transformer's ass.

02:10:14.558 --> 02:10:17.311
So, really, this is
a no-win situation.

02:10:17.394 --> 02:10:18.645
It's over.

02:10:18.729 --> 02:10:19.730
That was mean.

02:10:19.938 --> 02:10:23.233
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't
handle the cold-hearted truth!

02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:26.111
<i>Optimus, what are my
orders with these humans?</i>

02:10:26.195 --> 02:10:27.529
<i>Can I squish the bald guy?</i>

02:10:27.613 --> 02:10:29.031
They're in trouble.

02:10:29.114 --> 02:10:30.908
Nah! This isn't our fight!

02:10:30.991 --> 02:10:33.785
I'm done being an underdog.
Underdogs suck!

02:10:33.869 --> 02:10:35.704
I say they get
what they deserve.

02:10:35.787 --> 02:10:37.247
What's the play, Prime?

02:10:37.456 --> 02:10:40.334
It's time for reinforcements.

02:10:42.669 --> 02:10:45.839
Recognize one of your Knights.

02:11:06.026 --> 02:11:08.946
The legend exists.

02:11:16.203 --> 02:11:17.579
Come on.

02:11:18.872 --> 02:11:20.874
All right, come on!
Come on, let's go!

02:11:21.124 --> 02:11:22.292
Bee, go!

02:11:26.797 --> 02:11:28.966
Come on, we got to move!
Let's go, move!

02:11:32.719 --> 02:11:35.180
Where's Tessa? Tessa, get over here!
Come on.

02:11:35.264 --> 02:11:36.557
Get over here!

02:11:37.224 --> 02:11:39.142
Stay behind me!
I'm covering you!

02:11:39.226 --> 02:11:41.603
If I stop covering you,
it means I'm dead.

02:11:41.687 --> 02:11:42.938
But that ain't gonna happen.

02:11:44.273 --> 02:11:45.607
Take that!

02:11:47.818 --> 02:11:50.320
I'm a wicked warrior robot!

02:11:51.071 --> 02:11:52.072
Goddamn!

02:11:52.406 --> 02:11:53.574
Come on! We gotta move now!

02:11:55.158 --> 02:11:56.243
Go, go!

02:12:02.583 --> 02:12:04.626
We got hostiles coming
down the street!

02:12:06.336 --> 02:12:07.337
Go!

02:12:12.175 --> 02:12:14.177
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:19.933
We're surrounded!

02:12:20.017 --> 02:12:21.143
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

02:12:21.643 --> 02:12:22.686
Rocket!

02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:24.563
Go, go, go!

02:12:24.730 --> 02:12:25.856
Get down!

02:12:28.859 --> 02:12:30.444
Oh, this is the perfect
place to hide.

02:12:30.527 --> 02:12:34.239
A big glass box! Nobody will ever
find us here! That's...

02:12:37.075 --> 02:12:39.244
You've got to be kidding me.

02:12:39.870 --> 02:12:44.041
Legendary warriors, the
powers that created us

02:12:44.124 --> 02:12:46.877
now want us all extinguished.

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:51.256
We must join forces, or else
forever be their slaves.

02:12:52.799 --> 02:12:55.886
So today you stand with us...

02:12:56.094 --> 02:12:59.890
...or you stand against me.

02:13:06.897 --> 02:13:08.732
We'll let Prime
figure this one out.

02:13:08.815 --> 02:13:10.025
Very wise.

02:13:10.192 --> 02:13:12.694
There's no friggin' way I'm
staying down here with them.

02:13:12.778 --> 02:13:14.029
No way. No way.

02:13:19.451 --> 02:13:23.288
Only together can we survive!

02:13:24.748 --> 02:13:26.083
Let me lead you!

02:13:38.095 --> 02:13:39.346
Oh, no.

02:13:39.429 --> 02:13:41.682
I was expecting a giant car.

02:13:41.932 --> 02:13:43.266
Come here!

02:13:49.439 --> 02:13:51.733
We're giving you freedom.

02:14:07.958 --> 02:14:10.669
You defend my family,

02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:14.381
or die.

02:14:17.384 --> 02:14:18.969
Autobots,

02:14:19.177 --> 02:14:23.807
we're going to prove who
we are and why we're here!

02:14:25.016 --> 02:14:27.394
Ugh, you just want
to die for the guy.

02:14:27.477 --> 02:14:30.647
That's leadership. Or
brainwashing, or something.

02:14:30.731 --> 02:14:34.484
No. That's Optimus Prime.

02:14:40.574 --> 02:14:43.326
Autobots, we charge together!

02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:46.413
Now, roll out!

02:14:48.999 --> 02:14:51.376
We're getting boxed in! We're
getting flanked everywhere!

02:14:51.835 --> 02:14:53.128
Help me out here!

02:14:53.211 --> 02:14:54.296
Kill anything that moves!

02:14:55.422 --> 02:14:57.299
Come on, Cade, shoot!

02:14:59.009 --> 02:15:00.635
Come and get some,
you little bitch!

02:15:00.719 --> 02:15:02.053
Incoming!

02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:08.351
I can't believe I'm putting
my life in your hands.

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:09.770
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.

02:15:09.936 --> 02:15:10.937
- Go ahead, take it.
- No, I don't want the gun.

02:15:11.021 --> 02:15:12.022
- Come on, you can lead.
- No, I don't want the gun.

02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:13.565
Then stay under
there and shut up!

02:15:13.774 --> 02:15:16.067
All right. You're good with the gun.
So you keep it.

02:15:20.155 --> 02:15:22.532
Running out of guns and ammo.

02:15:22.616 --> 02:15:23.617
Ow!

02:15:30.624 --> 02:15:33.293
Come and get some!

02:15:33.543 --> 02:15:36.254
You're all gonna die!

02:15:56.942 --> 02:15:58.443
Way to go, baby!

02:15:59.486 --> 02:16:00.904
Good shooting, Cade!

02:16:02.739 --> 02:16:08.453
I'm like a fat ballerina who
takes scalps and slits throats!

02:16:15.585 --> 02:16:17.170
Got your fortune cookie!

02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:20.298
Come here, you little punk.

02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:26.930
Pull the pin! I'm
dying out here!

02:16:27.222 --> 02:16:28.223
Here! Take it. Take it!

02:16:28.306 --> 02:16:29.766
Little help! Little help!

02:16:30.475 --> 02:16:31.977
It's live! It's live, it's live.
Take it!

02:16:32.059 --> 02:16:33.019
What do you want
me to do with it?

02:16:33.102 --> 02:16:34.938
- Just throw it!
- Give, give, give!

02:16:49.076 --> 02:16:50.620
Got some bad news, Cade.

02:16:50.995 --> 02:16:53.623
I'm out of ammo
and out of ideas.

02:17:03.133 --> 02:17:05.093
Faster! Go!

02:17:12.601 --> 02:17:13.977
I'll kill you!

02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:45.008
Charge!

02:17:56.186 --> 02:17:58.772
No, impossible!

02:17:58.855 --> 02:18:01.148
They're ruining everything!

02:18:02.191 --> 02:18:03.192
Take that!

02:18:10.867 --> 02:18:12.035
Get off me.

02:18:13.702 --> 02:18:15.455
- Get up, Hound!
- I can't go on.

02:18:15.538 --> 02:18:17.123
But you gotta keep fighting!

02:18:17.207 --> 02:18:18.708
Tank's empty, bro.

02:18:19.668 --> 02:18:20.960
There's more of 'em coming.
If you don't get up

02:18:21.044 --> 02:18:22.379
and fight, we're going to die.
Let's go!

02:18:27.717 --> 02:18:29.218
Attack!

02:18:33.263 --> 02:18:34.933
Optimus is here!

02:18:46.068 --> 02:18:47.736
Bee, jump!

02:19:36.745 --> 02:19:37.954
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

02:20:08.276 --> 02:20:10.153
<i>I hate cheap knockoffs.</i>

02:20:12.322 --> 02:20:13.406
Awesome job!

02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:15.366
- You.
- Who?

02:20:15.450 --> 02:20:16.910
- You.
- Step forward.

02:20:17.118 --> 02:20:18.119
Wait. Why?

02:20:18.203 --> 02:20:22.540
Your science will be responsible
for humanity's extinction.

02:20:22.749 --> 02:20:27.796
All right. I know that you're sensitive
to this whole bioethical dilemma.

02:20:28.004 --> 02:20:29.047
Maybe all he wants
to hear you say is

02:20:29.130 --> 02:20:30.507
that some things should
never be invented.

02:20:30.673 --> 02:20:32.133
Ahhh!

02:20:35.345 --> 02:20:36.429
Okay.

02:20:36.971 --> 02:20:38.515
We'll lead you out of the city.

02:20:38.598 --> 02:20:41.684
Get that Seed safely
to the hills.

02:20:41.768 --> 02:20:43.186
Use this car.

02:20:43.394 --> 02:20:44.687
He almost ate me!

02:20:47.649 --> 02:20:48.983
All right, we're good!

02:20:49.567 --> 02:20:50.568
All right, let's go!

02:20:52.737 --> 02:20:53.738
Get out of that seat.

02:20:55.323 --> 02:20:57.158
And you're one lucky
dad to have me.

02:20:58.827 --> 02:21:01.538
Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that.
You drive. Let's go.

02:21:12.674 --> 02:21:13.716
What did you do?

02:21:13.883 --> 02:21:16.386
I don't know. I don't
know, but it's an issue.

02:21:16.594 --> 02:21:17.804
- Did you press a button?
- Is it gonna blow up?

02:21:17.887 --> 02:21:18.888
I don't know.

02:21:19.055 --> 02:21:21.224
Your thing is beeping now, so
you must have hit something.

02:21:21.307 --> 02:21:23.017
- Is it gonna blow up?
- I don't know!

02:21:23.143 --> 02:21:25.311
A bomb starts beeping, that might
signal a problem, you think?

02:21:25.395 --> 02:21:28.064
I'm just saying that it's
a steady blinking light,

02:21:28.148 --> 02:21:29.691
which could be a
timer of some kind.

02:21:30.733 --> 02:21:32.694
Unless it's signaling location.

02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:35.238
To who?

02:21:43.163 --> 02:21:45.290
We've got to call the central
government for help!

02:21:50.712 --> 02:21:52.839
Optimus Prime.

02:21:54.257 --> 02:21:56.676
Come to me.

02:22:56.486 --> 02:22:57.487
Defense Minister...

02:22:57.862 --> 02:22:59.614
...there's a crisis
in Hong Kong!

02:23:04.118 --> 02:23:06.204
The central government will
protect Hong Kong at all costs.

02:23:06.829 --> 02:23:08.498
We have fighter jets on the way.

02:23:15.171 --> 02:23:16.172
There's the bridge.

02:23:34.857 --> 02:23:36.067
Back it up! Back it up!

02:23:36.359 --> 02:23:39.904
Go, go, go, go! Back up!
Go back! Go back!

02:23:39.988 --> 02:23:41.364
Move! Get out of the way.
I can't see!

02:23:41.572 --> 02:23:43.574
- Shane, drive faster!
- Okay, just calm down.

02:23:56.045 --> 02:23:57.046
- Shane, watch out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:24:00.883 --> 02:24:02.593
- Get cover!
- Back up! Back! Back up!

02:24:07.974 --> 02:24:09.726
Autobots, fall back!

02:24:14.188 --> 02:24:15.940
- Come on, move! Out of my way!
- Get out of the way!

02:24:16.024 --> 02:24:17.608
- Look out!
- Just hit them! Just hit them!

02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:38.671
It's a big magnet!

02:24:38.921 --> 02:24:40.590
It's sucking up metal
and dropping it!

02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:45.219
Oh!

02:24:47.597 --> 02:24:48.598
- Go faster! Go faster!
- Move!

02:24:48.681 --> 02:24:50.683
- Get out of the way!
- It's coming! It's coming!

02:24:50.767 --> 02:24:52.268
It's coming closer!

02:24:52.602 --> 02:24:54.145
Go faster, Shane!

02:24:56.439 --> 02:24:57.607
Watch out, watch out!

02:24:58.524 --> 02:25:00.193
- Watch out!
- Look out!

02:25:00.443 --> 02:25:01.444
Whoa!

02:25:04.113 --> 02:25:05.239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:25:06.115 --> 02:25:09.577
Oh, no, now it's circling back towards us!
Hard right! Take a hard right!

02:25:09.994 --> 02:25:11.120
Move it! Get out of the way!

02:25:11.496 --> 02:25:13.873
Oh, my God!

02:25:28.638 --> 02:25:30.973
Oh, no. No, the magnet.
Get out, get out!

02:25:31.307 --> 02:25:33.601
Come on! Come here! Get out!

02:25:35.436 --> 02:25:37.313
No, no, no! No, we're going up.
Grab the bomb!

02:25:37.397 --> 02:25:38.731
Help me grab the bomb!

02:25:38.815 --> 02:25:39.982
I can't get
the seat belt off!

02:25:40.066 --> 02:25:41.651
Pull me down! Catch me!

02:25:41.818 --> 02:25:43.319
I'm going up! I'm going up!

02:25:43.486 --> 02:25:44.904
Get me! Grab me!

02:25:46.656 --> 02:25:48.324
Pull me down! Pull me!

02:25:48.408 --> 02:25:49.742
I can't get
the seat belt off!

02:25:49.826 --> 02:25:51.411
I can't get the belt off!

02:25:52.495 --> 02:25:53.996
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

02:25:55.164 --> 02:25:56.499
Hold the bomb!
I can't hold on!

02:25:57.792 --> 02:25:58.793
Pull!

02:25:59.001 --> 02:26:00.461
Guys, it's crushing me!

02:26:12.515 --> 02:26:13.766
Car!

02:26:14.183 --> 02:26:15.309
Move!

02:26:19.147 --> 02:26:20.148
Shane!

02:26:20.523 --> 02:26:22.275
- Shane!
- I'm good! I'm good.

02:26:22.775 --> 02:26:23.818
I'm good.

02:26:29.907 --> 02:26:30.908
Bumblebee!

02:26:34.078 --> 02:26:35.538
<i>Hey, you guys!</i>

02:26:36.330 --> 02:26:37.373
<i>Yee-hah!</i>

02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:38.541
Come on.

02:26:40.042 --> 02:26:41.210
Go find someplace safe.

02:26:41.586 --> 02:26:42.879
I'm proud of you.

02:26:57.268 --> 02:26:58.352
Get cover!

02:27:03.691 --> 02:27:04.775
Cade!

02:27:06.068 --> 02:27:10.364
Autobots, get this bomb over the
bridge and out of the city!

02:27:10.448 --> 02:27:11.491
Dad!

02:27:12.158 --> 02:27:13.618
What? Come on.

02:28:10.299 --> 02:28:12.510
I got it! I'm getting
this bomb out of here!

02:28:12.677 --> 02:28:13.844
Give me the gun.

02:28:14.887 --> 02:28:16.973
It's you and me now!

02:28:23.187 --> 02:28:24.272
Look, Optimus is out
there all alone.

02:28:24.355 --> 02:28:25.606
What? You can't help him.

02:28:25.773 --> 02:28:27.149
I have to, Tess. He
came back for us.

02:28:27.316 --> 02:28:28.401
Dad, don't leave, please.

02:28:28.651 --> 02:28:30.152
Look, I'll find you,
I'll get there, okay?

02:28:30.319 --> 02:28:31.571
Dad, no, you'll die!

02:28:31.654 --> 02:28:33.406
You gotta stay with Shane.
You're gonna be okay.

02:28:33.614 --> 02:28:34.699
You promise me you're
gonna keep her safe,

02:28:34.782 --> 02:28:36.993
rest of her life, until the end of time!
Promise me!

02:28:37.159 --> 02:28:38.536
I promise you.

02:28:38.995 --> 02:28:40.413
You're the best thing
I ever made, Tess.

02:28:40.496 --> 02:28:42.456
All right, don't ever forget
it, it was always you.

02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:44.000
- I love you.
- Please.

02:28:44.584 --> 02:28:45.876
Get in the car, now.

02:28:46.085 --> 02:28:47.253
Dad!

02:28:56.887 --> 02:28:58.723
Prime!

02:29:24.915 --> 02:29:26.375
Stop the car!

02:29:27.293 --> 02:29:29.211
<i>- You better listen.</i>
- No, you listen.

02:29:30.546 --> 02:29:32.423
I'm not leaving my dad.

02:29:44.226 --> 02:29:47.897
All right, we're gonna
hold the line, then block the bridge!

02:30:16.676 --> 02:30:18.844
You see, it takes
patience to make a man.

02:30:18.928 --> 02:30:22.390
The patience to watch and wait,
to protect all of us, quietly,

02:30:22.473 --> 02:30:25.267
for God and country, without
any recognition at all!

02:30:30.606 --> 02:30:31.607
Cade!

02:30:32.024 --> 02:30:36.028
There are no good aliens!
Or bad aliens, Yeager.

02:30:36.112 --> 02:30:38.656
It's just us and them.

02:30:38.739 --> 02:30:40.116
And you chose them.

02:30:46.539 --> 02:30:47.540
Anytime.

02:30:58.968 --> 02:31:02.346
You saved the human instead
of saving yourself?

02:31:02.430 --> 02:31:04.640
You bring shame upon us all.

02:31:20.072 --> 02:31:22.158
She never listens. Never.

02:31:25.327 --> 02:31:27.496
I gave you an order!

02:31:41.260 --> 02:31:43.012
Get out of here, now!

02:31:43.095 --> 02:31:44.096
Get in. Get in.

02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:46.849
Hey, you! Hey!

02:31:48.601 --> 02:31:53.022
Cade, get out of here!
This is my fight!

02:31:55.441 --> 02:31:59.862
It's my fight, and
you're all gonna die!

02:32:08.954 --> 02:32:10.539
Go! Go!

02:32:11.207 --> 02:32:12.208
Come on! Come on!

02:32:18.714 --> 02:32:20.382
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass!

02:32:28.641 --> 02:32:30.142
Whoo!

02:32:38.609 --> 02:32:39.652
Come on.

02:32:47.827 --> 02:32:49.161
Get away, all of you!

02:32:50.538 --> 02:32:52.414
Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess.
Come on, Tess.

02:33:00.422 --> 02:33:01.423
Drive!

02:33:04.343 --> 02:33:06.762
- You see my face, your life is done!
- Oh!

02:33:06.971 --> 02:33:07.972
Come on, come on, come on!

02:33:24.613 --> 02:33:25.614
Yeah!

02:33:27.533 --> 02:33:29.869
Honor to the end.

02:33:31.704 --> 02:33:32.955
You still happy we met?

02:33:38.294 --> 02:33:39.295
Always.

02:33:46.844 --> 02:33:47.845
Hurry!

02:33:49.305 --> 02:33:51.807
Quickly! I'm setting off
Lockdown's grenade!

02:33:51.891 --> 02:33:52.892
Hold tight!

02:34:09.575 --> 02:34:15.164
We shall meet again,
Prime, for I am reborn.

02:34:30.846 --> 02:34:32.848
Kind of nice being your
hero for a change.

02:34:34.183 --> 02:34:36.685
You always were.
All my life.

02:34:38.187 --> 02:34:39.188
I love you.

02:34:40.397 --> 02:34:41.565
I love you, too.

02:34:42.858 --> 02:34:44.234
Let's go home to
graduation, huh?

02:34:45.402 --> 02:34:46.403
Yeah.

02:34:47.029 --> 02:34:48.530
You're okay, kid.

02:34:48.697 --> 02:34:51.408
Come here, you're all right.
You're all right.

02:34:55.037 --> 02:34:56.956
We don't have a home, Dad.

02:34:57.039 --> 02:34:58.248
It blew up.

02:35:02.878 --> 02:35:04.964
I might be able to
help you with that.

02:35:10.928 --> 02:35:12.304
Brave warriors...

02:35:13.472 --> 02:35:15.057
...you are free!

02:35:16.475 --> 02:35:18.894
I'll ride
with you anytime, Spike!

02:35:38.330 --> 02:35:39.832
Did you miss me?

02:35:40.582 --> 02:35:41.750
No.

02:35:43.836 --> 02:35:48.590
This Seed belongs to our
creators, whoever they are.

02:35:49.174 --> 02:35:51.552
There remains a
price on my head.

02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:55.305
I endanger you all if I stay.

02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:59.977
I shall take it where
it can never be found.

02:36:01.562 --> 02:36:03.147
Will we ever see you again?

02:36:03.397 --> 02:36:04.690
Cade Yeager,

02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:06.942
I do not know.

02:36:07.443 --> 02:36:10.112
But whenever you
look to the stars,

02:36:10.779 --> 02:36:12.990
think of one of them

02:36:13.991 --> 02:36:15.784
as my soul.

02:36:17.161 --> 02:36:19.997
Defend this family, Autobots,

02:36:21.498 --> 02:36:23.667
as they have you.

02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:26.628
Defend

02:36:27.296 --> 02:36:29.381
all they can be.

02:36:36.722 --> 02:36:39.016
<i>There are
mysteries to the universe</i>

02:36:39.099 --> 02:36:41.518
<i>we were never meant to solve.</i>

02:36:42.686 --> 02:36:46.690
<i>But who we are and
why we are here</i>

02:36:47.566 --> 02:36:49.568
<i>are not among them.</i>

02:36:50.194 --> 02:36:54.239
<i>Those answers we carry inside.</i>

02:36:55.074 --> 02:36:57.743
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

02:36:57.826 --> 02:37:01.246

<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

02:37:07.086 --> 02:37:08.545
<i>for you.</i>
