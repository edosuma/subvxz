WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.603
My name is Brian Finch.

00:02.636 --> 00:05.173
I was your average
28-year-old screwup

00:05.206 --> 00:07.608
until I took a pill called NZT.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.644
Suddenly I had access
to every brain cell.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.680
Every time he takes it,
for the next 12 hours,

00:12.713 --> 00:14.248
he basically becomes the
smartest person in the world.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.283
BRIAN:
And that's why
the FBI hired me.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.284
My name's Brian Finch,

00:16.317 --> 00:17.285
this is Rebecca Harris,

00:17.318 --> 00:18.219
and we're with the FBI.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.787
God, that sounds cool.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.522
There's just one problem.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.191
NZT will kill you,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.293
unless you have this.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.361
Now you can have as much NZT as
you want with no side effects.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.729
Why would you help me?

00:28.762 --> 00:29.830
Let's just say I need somebody

00:29.863 --> 00:30.831
in a position.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.700
You describe to the FBI,
or anyone,

00:32.733 --> 00:33.567
about these shots...

00:33.601 --> 00:35.169
I will let you die
more painfully

00:35.203 --> 00:36.837
and slowly than you can fathom.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.607
So, Brian, you ready
to become somebody who matters?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.246
It's time.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.623
BRIAN:
So, what's it like to work
for the FBI?

00:55.656 --> 00:59.260
(spy theme playing)

00:59.293 --> 01:01.262
All in.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.434
Colonel October's men
have the uncut diamonds.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.368
You need to win this hand

01:07.401 --> 01:09.803
if we're gonna protect
the launch codes.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.841
And, Brian,

01:13.874 --> 01:17.345
you don't play baccarat
with Uno cards.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.815
Just shut up, okay?

01:21.849 --> 01:24.818
This is my fantasy.
It's not yours.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.722
It's not exactly like
I imagined it would be.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.560
The first thing they asked me
to do was sit around.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.329
A lot.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.298
They wanted to study me,
so they could find out

01:37.331 --> 01:40.301
why I'm immune
to the side effects of NZT.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.402
(speaking
indistinctly)

01:41.435 --> 01:42.803
Which is good,

01:42.836 --> 01:44.405
because the side effects are
Ow!

01:44.438 --> 01:46.540
very, very bad.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.342
Of course,
I know why I'm immune.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.711
But I can't tell them that.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.246
EDDIE:
You take one
of these shots,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.348
and you can have as much NZT
as you want.

01:54.382 --> 01:57.818
So they wanted me to do
everything exactly like I did

01:57.851 --> 01:59.353
before they gave me the job.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.928
But it turns out,
getting watched all the time

02:07.961 --> 02:09.863
gets old fast.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.466
NZT kept things... interesting.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.402
For 12 hours a day,
I had access

02:14.435 --> 02:16.604
to every nook and cranny
of my brain.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.838
You're on the verge
of having a life

02:17.871 --> 02:20.574
that most people
can't even begin to imagine.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.711
* Can't afford a therapist

02:23.744 --> 02:25.613
* Sorry, guys

02:25.646 --> 02:29.450
* Here's a solo...

02:29.483 --> 02:30.918
Those two guys?

02:30.951 --> 02:32.386
They're
my official babysitters.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.189
They've got names, I think.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.157
I just call them Mike and Ike.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.361
By the time a week went by,

02:40.394 --> 02:41.395
we all got a little stir-crazy.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.738
(smooching sounds)

02:50.771 --> 02:52.973
I think we were all very happy

02:53.006 --> 02:54.942
when the FBI said
they were finally ready

02:54.975 --> 02:56.510
to put me to work.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.680
So, no, I'm-I'm not saying
that I'm an FBI agent,

02:59.713 --> 03:01.582
per se. Uh,
it's more of, like...

03:01.615 --> 03:02.950
It's like
an affiliation.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.219
You know?
Like mutual welfare, benefit.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.355
That kind of thing.
MAN: Mutual? I mean,

03:07.388 --> 03:08.456
what's in it for them?
Uh,

03:08.489 --> 03:10.391
you'd be surprised, actually.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.993
It turns out, uh,
I've got talents.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.595
Aptitudes,
I guess you could call them.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.665
Doesn't the FBI do
background checks?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.401
They give, uh,

03:20.434 --> 03:21.769
vouchers, I think,

03:21.802 --> 03:24.838
waivers for, you know...

03:24.872 --> 03:28.909
DENNIS:
Sounds like an
incredible opportunity.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.580
That guy right there,
the one who just rescued me,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.348
he just got a new liver,

03:34.382 --> 03:36.784
arrangements courtesy
of yours truly.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.387
Well, the FBI technically got
the liver.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.589
I just agreed to take a job
so they would do it.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.791
They say your dad's
coming home on Thursday.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.859
So I thought
we should all do dinner.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.295
I mean, if,

03:47.328 --> 03:48.796
you know,
you don't have a mission.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.332
Should be good.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.900
Sorry. I just want to get back
to the FBI thing,

03:52.933 --> 03:54.034
okay?
Yes.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.537
So if you
are not an agent,
No.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.971
are you...
Oh...

03:58.005 --> 03:59.440
...deputized?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.974
Do you...

04:01.008 --> 04:02.443
have a badge and a gun?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.281
BOYLE:
Welcome to the FBI.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.049
You'll never see a real badge
or a gun,

04:09.082 --> 04:10.984
but at least you got those.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.621
(chuckling)
Are you hazing me?

04:13.654 --> 04:16.357
That's awesome.
(chuckles) Thanks, man.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.660
So? Day one.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.862
So epic. Where we going?

04:21.895 --> 04:24.998
Boyle and I are
going to Fort Greene.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.935
A journalist named
Stephen Fisher died
in a one-car accident

04:27.968 --> 04:29.703
last night.
Okay.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.704
Um, I thought
we were, like, a...

04:30.738 --> 04:32.873
like, an elite division
or something, you know?

04:32.906 --> 04:33.841
But we investigate car crashes?

04:33.874 --> 04:36.076
Um,

04:36.109 --> 04:38.646
not typically.
But Stephen Fisher wrote

04:38.679 --> 04:39.747
about corruption
at three different

04:39.780 --> 04:41.715
Fortune 500
companies.
Ah.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.884
He was nominated for a Pulitzer
after he exposed

04:43.917 --> 04:46.720
a Russian intelligence operation
at a defense contractor.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.522
He had enemies
in very high places.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.523
We want to
make sure

04:49.557 --> 04:51.559
one of them didn't kill him.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.794
Possible KGB assassination
in Brooklyn.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.429
I'm all
over it.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.599
Mike, give me my pill.
Let's do this.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.700
BOYLE:
There hasn't been
a KGB

04:59.733 --> 05:01.502
since 1991.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.337
No?
No.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.072
And Agent Harris
told you what we're doing.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.039
You...

05:06.073 --> 05:08.041
are staying here.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.046
Your first
assignment.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.982
You want me to learn Farsi?

05:15.015 --> 05:18.352
The Bureau needs analysts
that speak this language.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.822
"Analysts."

05:21.855 --> 05:25.025
So... I just...

05:25.058 --> 05:27.395
sit here in this room?

05:27.428 --> 05:29.530
Only while you're on NZT.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.532
W...

05:33.133 --> 05:35.703
(scoffs)

05:35.736 --> 05:37.538
(sighs)

05:37.571 --> 05:38.772
What happens

05:38.806 --> 05:41.409
if I try to leave? Are these
guys... are they my bodyguards?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.444
Or are they... prison wardens?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.713
This isn't what either of us
expected when I brought you in,

05:45.746 --> 05:47.381
Brian, but it's a first step.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.950
(sighs)

05:49.983 --> 05:51.919
You can do good work from here.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.455
Do enough of it, everyone
will get hungry for more.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.790
And then you're
out of here.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.566
You okay?

06:05.599 --> 06:06.900
Yeah. I mean,

06:06.934 --> 06:09.470
I guess I just thought
there'd be more baccarat.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.638
Hmm?

06:10.671 --> 06:11.672
Don't worry about it.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.742
(sighs)

06:18.746 --> 06:20.714
(overlapping voices speaking
in Farsi)

06:27.688 --> 06:31.859
After a couple of hours, I had
a decent handle on basic Farsi.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.427
(groans)

06:33.461 --> 06:35.028
My head was spinning.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.697
I needed to think
about something else

06:36.730 --> 06:38.899
for a few minutes.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.537
Maybe I couldn't be out there
in the field,

06:43.571 --> 06:45.806
but I could learn more
about the guy who died.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.841
(exhales)

06:51.679 --> 06:54.882
Whoa.
Stephen Fisher was my age.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.819
I assumed he was old.
Like, at least 40.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.888
When I was 26,
I built a potato gun.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.091
That was my big accomplishment.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.561
This guy forced the CEO of Yao
to resign.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.764
He called out hypocrites and
corrupt fat guys everywhere.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.866
He traveled the whole world.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.768
He fell in love.

07:14.802 --> 07:18.706
Stephen Fisher knew who he was.

07:18.739 --> 07:22.510
Which makes him
the polar opposite of me.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.113
BRIAN:
You see that, right?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.748
Mm-hmm.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.182
Now, why would somebody cover
up a new bumper sticker

07:29.216 --> 07:33.020
with another copy of
the exact same sticker?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.022
*

07:36.657 --> 07:38.592
(phone rings)
It's not a good time.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.728
BRIAN:
I don't think Stephen Fisher
died in an accident.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.029
Brian...
Uh-uh, hear me out.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.864
If you wanted to kill Fisher
in a way that looked

07:43.897 --> 07:46.834
like an accident, you could
easily rig up a car crash.

07:46.867 --> 07:47.868
You'd just need
a remote override

07:47.901 --> 07:49.503
of the car's control systems.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.772
And if you wanted to be sure
that Fisher was dead,

07:51.805 --> 07:53.507
you could even make
a little explosive

07:53.541 --> 07:54.742
that would make the gas tank
go up,

07:54.775 --> 07:56.043
and the whole thing
would get lost in the wreck.
Brian,

07:56.076 --> 07:58.078
can we talk about this
in ten minutes?
You could do all of that

07:58.111 --> 08:00.581
if you had an electronic chip
on the car.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.016
You'd just have to get it there.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.787
Fisher had a Thoughtful Dissent
sticker on the back right side

08:06.820 --> 08:08.622
of his car,
and a couple of days ago,

08:08.656 --> 08:10.190
somebody put
an identical sticker

08:10.223 --> 08:11.825
over the one
that was already there.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.128
Now, I think
that is where the chip is.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.897
Brian, I know.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.833
We found it under the bumper
sticker about an hour ago.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.836
Stephen Fisher's death
was a homicide.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.805
That's... Okay.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.307
Good. You're really good.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.077
Um, what about the bomb, though?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.579
It would have to be small enough

08:31.612 --> 08:32.846
that it broke apart
in the crash,

08:32.880 --> 08:35.082
and it'd also have to fit onto
the fuel check valve of a Jeep.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.249
We're looking for it.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.751
Uh, I can help.

08:37.785 --> 08:38.952
I've been doing a little
light reading about bombs,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.855
and there's three different
designs that I came up with.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.757
I'm pretty sure they're
the only ones that'll work.

08:43.791 --> 08:44.825
And right now I've just got

08:44.858 --> 08:46.694
toothpick models.
But if you'll call Mike and Ike

08:46.727 --> 08:48.596
and tell 'em I got to go out
and get a few things,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.564
I can make real ones.
And then we can show them

08:50.598 --> 08:52.666
to whoever's sorting
through the wreckage.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.735
I appreciate the tip. Seriously.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.103
But I-I have to go.
How are you supposed
to find evidence

08:56.136 --> 08:57.304
if you don't know
what you're looking for?

08:57.337 --> 08:59.773
You are not allowed out of
the office while you're on NZT.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.710
I'm sorry.
These are not my rules.
W...

09:12.385 --> 09:14.321
And speak English.
Don't be a show-off.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.289
Well, what happens
if you walk out of here?

09:16.323 --> 09:17.791
Mike and Ike
tackle you?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.660
Do you go
to Guantanamo?

09:19.693 --> 09:22.062
I don't know.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.798
But it'd be a lot easier
if I didn't have to find out.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.800
Well, picture
the layout.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.202
Remember
when you walked in?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.871
You walked
through the whole place.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.840
You know
exactly where everything is.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.808
That room where they're giving
the flu shots.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.244
It's right next door.
If I can get in there,

09:37.277 --> 09:40.113
I'll have access to the hallway
that leads out of here.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.751
That wall-- it cuts the ceiling
tiles off right in the middle.

09:43.784 --> 09:47.154
They just subdivided this room.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.822
New drywall.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.762
Finch?

10:38.906 --> 10:40.140
BRIAN:
No one was watching me.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.975
No one was measuring me.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.077
I was free.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.380
Well, basically free.

10:47.414 --> 10:51.985
I did have a shopping list,
and it was a big one.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.954
I had to get the parts
for the detonators

10:53.987 --> 10:55.222
so I could bring them
to the crime scene.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.690
And you would be amazed

10:56.724 --> 10:58.225
how difficult it is
to find materials

10:58.258 --> 11:00.327
for a model bomb.
I was getting close,

11:00.360 --> 11:02.329
but after I maxed out
my credit cards,

11:02.362 --> 11:04.031
I also needed money
to pay for it all.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.999
So I took
the Atlantic City Express,

11:06.033 --> 11:08.401
walked in with $17.32.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.037
Player wins.
Sweet.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.072
So that's it?
You just count to nine?

11:12.105 --> 11:14.074
That's baccarat.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.811
It's pretty simple
once you get the hang of it.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.047
Eventually, they told me
I had to stop playing.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.882
But it was more than enough
to buy my parts,

11:21.915 --> 11:23.083
and I figured out
how to put them together.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.185
And I met some cool people
on the bus.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.821
Bruce wasn't sure how
to get back in his kid's life.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.723
I walked him
through basic trigonometry

11:29.757 --> 11:32.926
so he could help the kid crush
the SATs.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.994
Dylan and Anne just broke up.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.428
I know. It's crazy.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.264
I just, you know,
talked 'em through some stuff

11:37.297 --> 11:40.734
and I think they're going
to give it another shot.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.336
I carved out enough alone time

11:43.370 --> 11:46.173
to finish my project
and then we were back.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.977
Guys, we should all
get together sometime.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.747
Guys. So...

11:53.781 --> 11:56.316
these are pretty much done.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.985
It's cool, right?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.753
Do you have any idea

11:59.787 --> 12:01.054
how many people
are looking for you?

12:01.088 --> 12:03.891
NAZ:
Do you know that the contents

12:03.924 --> 12:07.260
of your immune system
are a national secret?

12:07.294 --> 12:08.996
Or that flights were grounded
to make sure...

12:09.029 --> 12:11.098
BRIAN: To be honest,
she seemed a little paranoid.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.232
...in danger of being kidnapped.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.801
(horn warbling)

12:13.834 --> 12:15.468
If you go on like this,
I will pull your credentials

12:15.502 --> 12:17.104
and they can study you
down in D.C.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.807
(horn warbling)

12:19.840 --> 12:20.974
Understood?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.976
BRIAN: But I had to agree
I'd never do it again.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.979
Yo, Reb, you should see this.

12:30.050 --> 12:33.520
Each one of Finch's models has
this Y-shaped thing on one end.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.022
I found...

12:35.055 --> 12:37.557
that when I was
going through all the pictures

12:37.590 --> 12:38.859
of the wreckage we bagged.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.994
We have a piece of the bomb?
Yeah.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.963
When I was in Criminal,
I caught the guy

12:42.996 --> 12:45.032
who planted a bomb
in a judge's car.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.434
Now, he didn't build the
bomb, he just put it there.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.069
The bomb was built
by a contractor

12:49.102 --> 12:51.571
who goes by the name Taurus.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.406
Taurus.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.842
Didn't the Baltimore
field office

12:54.875 --> 12:56.476
have a task force
trying to run him down?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.378
Yeah, they spent a year
getting exactly nowhere.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.814
The guy's invisible.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.516
The bomb that was planted
on the judge's car...

13:03.550 --> 13:06.453
looked like that.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.888
Whoever built that

13:07.921 --> 13:09.890
built the one
that killed Stephen Fisher.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.862
Brian didn't just give us
a piece of the murder weapon,

13:14.895 --> 13:16.429
he also pointed us at a suspect.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.367
You give someone
performance-enhancing drugs,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.802
they perform.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.040
BRIAN: What happens
when NZT wears off?
(snoring)

13:27.074 --> 13:29.409
Even if you are immune to
the really, really bad stuff,

13:29.442 --> 13:30.610
your brain's still
been working overtime.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.313
And you crash. Hard.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.983
Are you spending the night?

13:36.016 --> 13:40.020
Oh, I'm sorry.
What time is it?

13:40.053 --> 13:41.955
Oh, my God,
I got to go.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.323
I'm sorry.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.557
See you
tomorrow.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.995
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't
be here earlier, Dad, I just...

13:48.028 --> 13:50.097
you know, I got caught up
at work. New job, and...

13:50.130 --> 13:52.032
It's okay, you didn't
miss anything.

13:52.065 --> 13:56.069
I-I fought with the insurance
people for about an hour.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.270
That was it.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.406
You fought? What were
you fighting about?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.975
Old lawyers never die,
they just argue

14:02.009 --> 14:03.376
with anybody who'll listen.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.178
Your mom wants me
to have a nurse

14:05.212 --> 14:07.380
when we get back
for a little while.
Absolutely.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.249
They disagree.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.518
So, anyway,

14:11.551 --> 14:14.187
this-this FBI thing-- you think
it's gonna be long-term?

14:14.221 --> 14:17.557
Oh, uh...

14:17.590 --> 14:19.092
You know, I don't
really know yet.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.961
But I'll tell you this:

14:20.994 --> 14:23.030
I wish you guys were more
excited about it, though.
You happy?

14:23.063 --> 14:25.665
We're fine.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.935
It's just so sudden.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.636
Listen, Brian...

14:29.669 --> 14:31.604
Are you sure this is what
you want for yourself?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.978
Um, it felt like
an opportunity

14:38.011 --> 14:39.679
that, uh...

14:39.712 --> 14:43.350
I had no choice but to take.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.684
Hmm.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.653
That's very lawyerly of you.

14:46.686 --> 14:50.257
BRIAN:
So let's review: there's
the stuff I can't tell my dad.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.525
When I was biting Adam's lip,
I was just thinking,

14:52.559 --> 14:53.994
"He looks hot."

14:54.027 --> 14:55.662
...policy positions.
Preliminary polls

14:55.695 --> 14:58.431
show New York Senator
Eddie Morra

14:58.465 --> 15:01.134
would have widespread bipartisan
appeal if he were to run in...

15:01.168 --> 15:03.036
BRIAN:
And then there's the stuff

15:03.070 --> 15:05.105
I can't tell anyone.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.673
You ready to become
somebody who matters?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.508
...dumb ass shot again.
I give this to you.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.611
You can have as much NZT as you
want with no side effects.

15:11.644 --> 15:15.448
BRIAN:
How often do I need
that shot he gave me?

15:18.085 --> 15:20.420
Why does Senator Morra
want me to work for the FBI?

15:34.567 --> 15:35.635
All right,

15:35.668 --> 15:38.538
good to go, team. I'm on
the straight and narrow path

15:38.571 --> 15:40.207
and I'm ready to learn
some Farsi.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.477
Agent Harris?

15:44.511 --> 15:46.613
Sorry to interrupt.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.148
It's Finch.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.349
What did he do?

15:49.382 --> 15:50.417
He has a message.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.320
He knows he's not involved
in your bombing case, but

15:53.353 --> 15:55.288
if you're interested,

15:55.322 --> 15:57.290
he figured out who Taurus is.

15:58.658 --> 16:02.195
How did he even know
we're looking for Taurus?

16:02.229 --> 16:03.196
I can read lips.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.265
It isn't that hard.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.134
People have been talking
to you your whole life.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.701
You just got to pay attention
to their mouths.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.304
"I did not read the Iliad.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.341
Maybe honesty counts
for points"?

16:14.374 --> 16:16.376
It does not,

16:16.409 --> 16:20.313
(distorted):
Mr. Finch.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.581
And when did you
read our lips?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.050
I was
coming back

16:23.083 --> 16:24.284
from the bathroom yesterday,
and I thought

16:24.317 --> 16:25.318
I'd check in on everyone.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.390
(slowed down):
I'm gonna call Baltimore...

16:32.325 --> 16:34.261
Taurus.
Okay.

16:34.294 --> 16:38.231
(distorted)

16:38.265 --> 16:40.667
I didn't say
"Brian equals terrible."

16:40.700 --> 16:43.436
No, you're right.
Those were not your exact words.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.040
Look, I'm pretty sure
I know who Taurus is.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.275
But...

16:48.308 --> 16:50.310
I know the FBI's
big on procedure.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.046
So if you want me
to stay in my lane, I get it.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.155
Brian.

17:02.189 --> 17:02.689
Finch.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.624
Tell us what you know.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.327
Taurus obviously has
high-level engineering training

17:07.360 --> 17:08.795
and some kind of background

17:08.828 --> 17:10.263
in bomb construction.
The number of people

17:10.297 --> 17:12.599
he conceivably could be
isn't that large.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.402
These computers were all broken.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.171
Not that broken.
Now, every time

17:18.205 --> 17:19.672
Taurus has been suspected
of killing someone,

17:19.706 --> 17:22.175
there's a guy from a security
firm that shows up on the news

17:22.209 --> 17:24.277
to talk about it.
Darren Cullen.

17:24.311 --> 17:26.179
Now, nothing too weird
about that.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.082
Cullen's an expert on bombs.
But in 2011, you guys

17:29.116 --> 17:31.184
think Taurus killed someone
by using a bomb

17:31.218 --> 17:33.153
that triggered
a spray of acid.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.854
When Cullen was on TV
right after,

17:34.887 --> 17:37.557
he had a bandage on his wrist.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.226
That was a nasty burn.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.494
Took a skin graft to treat.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.331
It's almost as if he was...
burned by acid or something.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.233
You think Darren Cullen
is Taurus?

17:46.266 --> 17:49.102
You're skeptical.
But Cullen fits the profile.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.537
And you know what else he's got?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.704
Three different patents.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.106
Here's the filing
for the first one.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.310
That look familiar?

18:02.882 --> 18:05.118
So in between appearances on
the news, this guy builds bombs

18:05.152 --> 18:07.120
for hire
in his apartment?

18:07.154 --> 18:10.123
I don't think
he uses his apartment.

18:10.157 --> 18:13.260
Darren Cullen has power of
attorney over his mother Judy.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.428
They filed the papers
in 2003. In 2005

18:15.462 --> 18:18.365
Judy Cullen bought an
auto repair shop in Queens

18:18.398 --> 18:20.533
that was about to go
out of business, and she still

18:20.567 --> 18:22.435
owns the building.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.173
A warrant?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.875
I restore vintage cars here.
Come on inside.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.877
Promise you'll be bored.

18:34.347 --> 18:38.218
No offense, but if I'm going
to be talking to the FBI,

18:38.251 --> 18:40.220
I should probably
check in with my lawyer.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.123
Let me know when you're done.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.204
Okay, so how long you want
to spend digging around in here?

18:59.939 --> 19:04.143
He's got a '68 Stingray
and a '75 911.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.414
These are all Corvette parts.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.881
He doesn't have anything
for the Porsche.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.489
Hey, hey.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.358
What are you doing?

19:19.859 --> 19:22.229
Plastique,
detonator wire, cash.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.763
Still got your lawyer
on the phone?

19:33.373 --> 19:35.875
We found equipment that ties you
to four different bombings.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.577
That's just at a glance.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.246
You're Taurus,

19:39.279 --> 19:41.781
and you're going to jail
for the rest of your life.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.416
The only choice you have left

19:43.450 --> 19:45.652
is whether or not
you want to cooperate with us.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.487
And if I do?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.522
If you volunteer the names
of your clients, we will

19:49.556 --> 19:52.959
tell the U.S. attorneys you
helped. That means something.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.395
Who hired you
to kill Stephen Fisher?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.435
Larry Trestment.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.637
He's head
of corporate security

20:04.671 --> 20:06.973
at Longitude Construction.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.476
Fisher was apparently
making inquiries

20:09.509 --> 20:12.712
about Longitude Construction's
subcontractors

20:12.745 --> 20:15.948
in Indonesia using unpaid labor.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.551
Let's send people over
to Longitude Construction,

20:18.585 --> 20:21.554
pick this guy
up for murder.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.790
Attempted murder, actually.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.726
I freely admit

20:26.759 --> 20:29.028
I am the contractor
known as Taurus.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.464
But in the interest
of precision--

20:31.498 --> 20:33.566
I'm an engineer, after all--

20:35.402 --> 20:38.305
there's one thing
you're wrong about.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.307
Taurus didn't
kill Stephen Fisher?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.708
We don't think so.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.009
He took the job.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.511
He planted the chip
and the detonator

20:44.544 --> 20:46.012
and then he hid
a Bluetooth transmitter

20:46.045 --> 20:48.748
under a newspaper kiosk
on Fulton.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.584
And this somehow
adds up to him not doing it?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.586
Fisher's accident
happened a mile before

20:53.620 --> 20:55.555
he would have driven
past the Bluetooth.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.590
The chip was
never triggered.
So it went off by mistake.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.825
We checked--

20:58.858 --> 21:00.460
the chip was never
activated.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.562
Well, if he didn't
kill Fisher, who did?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.831
At the moment, it looks like
it might be an accident.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.633
Stephen Fisher
wore a fitness tracker.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.935
There was a spike in his
heart rate before he died.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.770
The M.E.'s
taking another look

21:10.803 --> 21:12.472
at the remains,
but her first guess is that

21:12.505 --> 21:14.474
he had a stroke
before the wreck.

21:14.507 --> 21:18.044
No, 28-year-olds
don't drop dead of strokes.

21:18.077 --> 21:18.945
Something else happened.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.080
We looked at toxicology.
Fisher had the flu

21:21.113 --> 21:23.516
that's been going around,
but that's the only anomaly.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.918
Maybe it was
an accident.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.389
But there's at least
a chance that it wasn't.

21:29.422 --> 21:33.025
This guy risked his life

21:33.059 --> 21:34.394
to help people,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.329
and it could have
gotten him killed.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.997
We can't just call it a day.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.967
Well, no one's
giving up,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.769
but no matter what happens,

21:42.802 --> 21:44.904
you caught Taurus.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.674
We're arresting people all over
the country that hired him.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.577
You did
a great thing.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.614
Okay.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.121
I know what you're thinking.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.924
A stroke at 28?
A heart attack?

22:04.957 --> 22:06.526
Fisher didn't smoke.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.361
He didn't have diabetes.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.430
Something else happened.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.899
Can you cause a stroke?

22:12.932 --> 22:14.501
I don't know.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.803
But I'd rather not look on
the Internet to find out.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.939
Talk to the experts.
That makes sense.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.776
No, I can't leave here again.
They say I'll be fired.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.879
You care about finding out
what happened to Stephen Fisher.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.382
If you don't do it, who will?

22:33.119 --> 22:35.622
(phone buzzing)

22:35.655 --> 22:37.424
It's a text from Finch.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.758
"Sorry, guys."

22:38.791 --> 22:40.059
(loud clattering)

22:40.092 --> 22:41.394
Go cut him off.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.405
*

22:58.711 --> 23:01.548
BRIAN: So, assuming
it didn't happen naturally,

23:01.581 --> 23:05.151
how could you make
Stephen Fisher have a stroke?

23:05.184 --> 23:08.488
It was a question that took me
all over the city.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.825
If there were answers to find,
I had to find them

23:12.859 --> 23:15.462
before I went back to the FBI.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.498
Oh, and I found time to stop by
my dad's insurance company.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.433
By the time the pill wore off,

23:20.467 --> 23:22.469
things were starting
to come together.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.685
I just spent two hours
looking for you.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.653
I really think
that Stephen Fisher

23:40.687 --> 23:42.622
was a victim
of foul play--

23:42.655 --> 23:44.924
some other people, too--
but I need help to prove it

23:44.957 --> 23:46.459
before I go back to the FBI.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.761
You have one minute.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.564
(clicking)
Can I have two?

23:51.598 --> 23:53.633
I-I'm not on NZT.

23:53.666 --> 23:54.601
(click)

23:56.603 --> 23:58.805
Uh, okay, just...

23:58.838 --> 24:00.807
All right, come here.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.074
Come here.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.309
Uh, we'll
start here.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.745
(clears throat) Yeah, bring
that, bring that, bring that.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.547
Okay, so...

24:07.580 --> 24:10.249
I visited a bunch
of hospitals today, okay?

24:10.282 --> 24:13.119
And I was asking questions
about why one 28-year-old

24:13.152 --> 24:15.087
might have died
from a stroke.

24:15.121 --> 24:18.057
But I learned that
two other young guys--

24:18.090 --> 24:20.560
Diwal Reshmi
and Samir Desai--

24:20.593 --> 24:22.995
also had fatal strokes
in the past two days.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.131
And just like Stephen,
they caught the flu

24:25.164 --> 24:27.033
(snaps fingers)
and died of a stroke.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.201
They're both
Central Asian?
Just like Stephen.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.904
Now, based on their last names,
you could trace

24:31.938 --> 24:33.906
all of their heritage
back to Pakistan--

24:33.940 --> 24:36.075
this part where the, uh...

24:36.108 --> 24:38.244
where the Sayyid
tribe is, okay?

24:38.277 --> 24:41.814
Now, all the men
in that tribe claim to be

24:41.848 --> 24:44.116
direct descendants of...

24:45.818 --> 24:48.855
...Genghis Khan.
Ah, well, there's
a reason you brought this.

24:48.888 --> 24:53.793
Right. Now, he was one of the
most prolific breeders... ever.

24:53.826 --> 24:58.197
There's, like, a study that one
in every 200 men in the world

24:58.230 --> 25:01.133
are probably walking around
carrying the genetic marker

25:01.167 --> 25:03.803
that can be traced
back to him, okay?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.071
What if...

25:05.104 --> 25:07.173
somebody found a way

25:07.206 --> 25:09.308
to target that trait?

25:09.341 --> 25:12.211
(phone ringing)

25:12.244 --> 25:13.312
(sighs)

25:13.345 --> 25:14.847
Can I keep going?
Yes.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.916
Thank you.
Okay, come here.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.986
All right, now, based on
a lot of very, very new

25:20.019 --> 25:23.255
and, um-- where is it?

25:23.289 --> 25:26.025
It's new science--
it's very... it's
very complicated.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.128
We are right on the verge of
being able to build viruses

25:29.161 --> 25:33.132
that can target genetic
traits, specifically.

25:33.165 --> 25:37.069
And the Khan marker is the most
common one there is, okay?

25:37.103 --> 25:39.105
So what I'm saying is,

25:39.138 --> 25:41.207
what if someone,
theoretically,

25:41.240 --> 25:45.277
could make a virus that would
give most people the flu...

25:45.311 --> 25:48.080
but if somebody with
the Khan marker got it...

25:48.114 --> 25:50.650
They'd have a stroke.
...they'd have a stroke.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.785
Interesting.
Exactly.

25:52.819 --> 25:55.755
You'd have to be sure that
your target had the marker.
Yes.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.157
And there isn't any proof
that someone can make
a virus like...

25:58.190 --> 26:00.226
Yeah, but no, but-but do
you know what the odds

26:00.259 --> 26:02.862
of three guys dying of
a stroke at their age

26:02.895 --> 26:05.698
all within the same
48-hour period are?
It's, like, crazy.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.034
It's one in, um...

26:08.067 --> 26:10.637
It's really low.
It's, like, insanely low.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.772
One in a...
a trillion or something.
Okay.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.941
If this is right, there
has to be something

26:14.974 --> 26:17.677
that connects Stephen
Fisher to the other two.
Yeah.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.812
And that's this--
Young Molly's Coffee.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.914
Diwal Reshmi's wife
was a barista there.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.050
Samir worked at a bakery
that supplied the place.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.619
And guess who would go there
to write every single morning

26:26.653 --> 26:28.254
over an iced soy Americano.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.089
Stephen Fisher.

26:30.122 --> 26:34.026
Young Molly's is
ground zero for the virus.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.295
I don't know about you,
but I would really like

26:36.328 --> 26:38.631
to get in there and look
at those security tapes.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.701
But... as you and I both know,
I don't have a badge.

26:41.734 --> 26:44.637
And I most certainly
don't have a gun.
Or... have a gun. Got it.

26:44.671 --> 26:48.340
*

26:49.909 --> 26:53.045
REBECCA: See you at work. And
if you come into my apartment

26:53.079 --> 26:54.681
without permission again,

26:54.714 --> 26:56.215
I'll shoot you on sight.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.917
Bagels in the fridge.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.288
*

27:02.321 --> 27:03.990
BRIAN:
Work.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.659
This is going to be fun.

27:06.693 --> 27:10.062
*

27:10.096 --> 27:12.699
* You're fired
* Suplex, suplex,
suplex backbreaker *

27:12.732 --> 27:14.834
* You're fired

27:14.867 --> 27:17.203
* Suplex, suplex,
suplex backbreaker *

27:17.236 --> 27:22.074
* You're fired...
* Suplex,
suplex, suplex backbreaker *

27:22.108 --> 27:23.710
* Suplex, suplex *

27:23.743 --> 27:27.079
* Suplex backbreaker. *

27:31.117 --> 27:32.785
Genghis Khan?

27:32.819 --> 27:34.353
He's a notable conqueror

27:34.386 --> 27:36.789
and a prolific breeder.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.991
(long sigh)

27:39.025 --> 27:40.226
Here.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.794
You want this?

27:41.828 --> 27:43.696
Sorry to interrupt. Um,

27:43.730 --> 27:45.231
Brian brought
you up to speed?

27:45.264 --> 27:47.734
I went up to that
coffee shop this morning,

27:47.767 --> 27:48.768
Young Molly's, and...

27:48.801 --> 27:50.069
I think I found something.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.670
I went through
the security footage.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.408
And look at this.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.879
Four cups of coffee
on the counter.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.313
Then this guy
walks up.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.316
He doesn't take a cup of coffee,
he doesn't buy anything.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.451
What is he doing?

28:05.484 --> 28:06.719
It's hard to tell from that.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.320
I agree-- but take a look

28:08.354 --> 28:09.255
at that table.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.490
The woman taking that picture,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.860
she's a regular at Young
Molly's, so I waited around,

28:13.893 --> 28:15.995
and I fished this...
out of her deleted files.

28:18.798 --> 28:22.468
He's spraying the yellow cup.
NAZ: He's spraying Stephen
Fisher's cup with some kind

28:22.501 --> 28:24.804
of aerosol.
That is the most
efficient way

28:24.837 --> 28:26.338
to pass along viral cultures.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.874
Now, look at this.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.077
That's Fisher picking up
the white cup.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.512
NAZ:
So it wasn't Fisher's cup
he intended to spray.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.513
BRIAN:
Wait. If you're saying

28:34.546 --> 28:37.083
that Fisher wasn't the target,
then who was?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.785
(click)

28:40.519 --> 28:42.822
So who is she?

28:54.901 --> 28:57.804
BRIAN:
I got my pill and I listened
to them try and figure out

28:57.837 --> 28:59.471
who the real target was.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.473
(distorted chatter)

29:01.507 --> 29:03.509
Whoever that woman is,

29:03.542 --> 29:05.511
it seems obvious
she's the target.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.347
But there's one thing
we forgot.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.917
(yelling)

29:10.950 --> 29:12.985
Genghis Khan.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.887
He spread his genes everywhere,

29:14.921 --> 29:17.924
but the marker he passed
was patrilineal, which means...

29:17.957 --> 29:19.325
That woman isn't the target.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.928
The Genghis Khan marker
can only be passed through men.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.530
So even if she has the virus,
there's no way it manifests

29:24.563 --> 29:26.565
as anything other
than the flu.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.367
This is an assassination.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.336
That woman has
someone in her life

29:30.369 --> 29:32.004
that carries the marker.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.974
Now, he can't be easy to get to,
so they're using her

29:35.007 --> 29:38.010
to pass the virus.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.046
Well, even if she isn't
the target,

29:40.079 --> 29:41.547
we still have to find her.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.349
The whole plan
hinges on her being

29:43.382 --> 29:45.251
at the coffee shop.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.053
She's a regular.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.958
Right.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.960
Well, you kids have fun.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.929
I'll just be here, uh,
coming up with insights...

29:56.963 --> 29:59.431
and whatnot... with Naz.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.535
I was in the middle
of firing him.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.371
That is literally the meeting
you interrupted:

30:05.404 --> 30:08.407
me firing Brian Finch.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.275
Now...

30:09.308 --> 30:12.078
as an object of study,
he is invaluable;

30:12.111 --> 30:13.445
as a consultant, he's reckless.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.447
Every time
he leaves this building,

30:15.481 --> 30:17.116
good things happen.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.251
He gave us the bomb
that led to Taurus.

30:19.285 --> 30:22.154
He put us on the path of
a genetically engineered virus.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.423
He can do incredible things
on NZT,

30:24.456 --> 30:26.125
but he defines himself

30:26.158 --> 30:27.994
in opposition to institutions.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.462
I know the mindset;
I raised teenagers.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.965
And in the context
of this department,

30:32.999 --> 30:34.200
it's dangerous.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.434
He'll move past it.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.136
He's already come a long way.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.438
Last month he was a temp.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.641
There is one person that
Brian trusts in this building.

30:42.674 --> 30:46.312
If you want him to behave,
don't stick him in a file room.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.414
Let him work with me.

30:54.921 --> 30:57.089
So this is the field.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.225
I imagined

30:59.258 --> 31:01.493
a lot less
standing around.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.131
You made this happen,
didn't you?

31:05.164 --> 31:07.033
Am I gonna regret it?

31:11.938 --> 31:14.673
You know, we're trying
to find Olivia today--

31:14.706 --> 31:16.943
that might be
our problem.

31:16.976 --> 31:20.212
We should try finding her
a few days ago.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.285
BRIAN: Okay, so that block
is covered with cameras.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.955
I walked around with Ike today,

31:28.988 --> 31:29.888
and it's really amazing

31:29.922 --> 31:30.923
how generous people get
with their footage

31:30.957 --> 31:33.525
when you can stick
an FBI badge in their face.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.095
And if you can cut
enough of it together...

31:36.128 --> 31:39.631
REBECCA:
You can follow her.
Mm-hmm, that's right.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.168
So, she takes a cab to midtown,

31:42.201 --> 31:44.203
kills a couple of hours
at a rug store...

31:44.236 --> 31:45.604
What's up with the music?

31:45.637 --> 31:47.506
I added it.
It's way cooler.

31:47.539 --> 31:51.110
*

31:51.143 --> 31:54.013
BRIAN: There, see?
She goes to the Essex Hotel.

31:54.046 --> 31:57.149
Now, they pretend they
don't know each other at first.

31:57.183 --> 31:59.185
*

32:02.221 --> 32:03.355
But once they're inside...

32:03.389 --> 32:06.225
*

32:06.258 --> 32:07.226
Central Asian heritage,

32:07.259 --> 32:09.095
plus it looks like
they're having an affair.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.462
I'd say we found
our target.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.131
Well, if they're having
an affair,

32:12.164 --> 32:14.466
they probably didn't check in
under their real names.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.702
We can run the man through
facial recognition, but...

32:16.735 --> 32:19.105
it's blurry,
it might take a while.

32:19.138 --> 32:22.108
Oh, perfect.
I got some stuff to do.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.509
When your family's been
looking down on you for years,

32:23.542 --> 32:26.378
how do you get it to stop?

32:26.412 --> 32:27.579
Would you kill the music?

32:27.613 --> 32:30.182
I mean, the whole concept
of interviewing a four-year-old

32:30.216 --> 32:31.984
is absurd.
Right?

32:32.018 --> 32:32.851
But if you really want him

32:32.884 --> 32:34.420
to get in that preschool,
Cameron...

32:34.453 --> 32:35.754
Show up to dinner
before your NZT wears off.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.955
Bring Tommy's art

32:36.989 --> 32:40.126
to the meeting-- I mean, he
has a very highly developed

32:40.159 --> 32:42.061
sense of perspective.
Did you ever notice that?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.529
Uh... no.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.265
No, I think it's great
that the insurance company
changed their mind.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.433
Oh, I know.
But make sure the nurse

32:47.466 --> 32:50.002
understands protocols for
recent transplant patients.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.537
The Marquess of Queensberry.
I probably should

32:51.570 --> 32:52.604
have been
a little more cautious.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.240
Oh! Y.A. Tittle.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.008
Ah, the Cthuhlu Mythos.
Okay.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.143
What?
Longitude

32:57.176 --> 32:58.244
and latitude.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.678
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.

32:59.711 --> 33:00.512
Oh, Euclidean geometry.

33:00.546 --> 33:01.447
The Nicomachean Ethics.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.017
Mitosis and meiosis?

33:05.051 --> 33:07.519
*

33:09.688 --> 33:11.690
(groans softly)

33:31.143 --> 33:34.246
*

33:34.280 --> 33:35.747
(exhales)

33:46.225 --> 33:48.160
(electronic crackling)

33:55.501 --> 33:58.404
(exhales)

33:58.437 --> 33:59.605
DENNIS:
Brian?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.407
Yeah?
(clears throat)

34:01.440 --> 34:02.608
Hey.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.344
Mom told me that you
fell asleep down here.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.545
I did, yeah. I...

34:06.578 --> 34:09.115
We were having so much fun,
I think I drank

34:09.148 --> 34:11.317
an extra beer or two
and just...

34:11.350 --> 34:13.685
I think I'm gonna...
probably call a cab.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.686
Smart.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.255
How are you doing?

34:16.288 --> 34:17.623
I'm fine.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.825
I mean, I'm-I'm good.
I mean, what do you mean?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.427
Well, I mean...

34:21.460 --> 34:23.595
there's so much going on
with you lately.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.698
The FBI came out here and told
us that you were involved

34:26.732 --> 34:28.200
in some sort of...

34:28.234 --> 34:29.701
designer drug.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.304
And then somehow you
get me a new liver.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.606
And tonight you answered
every question in trivia.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.543
Yeah. I've been
really focused... really.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.645
Focused.
Mm-hmm.

34:39.678 --> 34:43.715
This wouldn't have anything to
do with this drug, would it?

34:43.749 --> 34:45.684
What? Come on.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.753
Thanks a lot, Dad.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.156
Come on, you know that
I've always believed that
you would do great things,

34:50.189 --> 34:51.857
even when you
didn't believe it.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.659
We can talk
to each other

34:53.692 --> 34:55.627
about anything, Brian,
and that's never gonna change.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.397
Dad, stop.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.767
There's no drug, okay?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.669
I swear.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.571
There is something

35:05.604 --> 35:07.573
that you're not telling me.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.441
And that's your prerogative,

35:09.475 --> 35:11.143
because you're an adult.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.811
But so am I.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.515
And I am not
gonna play along

35:16.548 --> 35:19.818
when you're lying to me.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.221
You understand that?

35:26.392 --> 35:28.360
*

35:34.666 --> 35:35.901
You're here. Good.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.403
No, it's not good.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.771
Look, I had to lie
to my dad last night

35:39.805 --> 35:40.939
about all of this,
okay? Point-blank.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.775
I'm sorry.
But we have to move.
I can't keep lying.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.578
Our facial recognition guy
got a hit on the man
from the elevator.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.914
His name is Ram Ananda--
he's a general in the Army

35:48.947 --> 35:51.817
and he's stationed
at Fort Hamilton.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.253
The general was a little sick
this morning, but he seemed

35:54.286 --> 35:55.921
basically fine.
REBECCA:
We need to see him.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.457
BOYLE:
General Ananda?

36:14.573 --> 36:17.343
General Ananda is
in a medically induced coma.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.944
The stroke was bad,
but they intervened early.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.812
They say he has
a decent chance of recovery.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.482
Well, that's good news.
MAN (on TV):
At Eukaryote we foster a, uh,

36:23.515 --> 36:25.384
environment of innovation
through competition.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.420
It's a philosophy
that drives us to excel.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.955
Periodic layoffs are

36:29.988 --> 36:32.791
the so-called
"fire that cleanses the forest,"

36:32.824 --> 36:34.460
and our
high-performing employees

36:34.493 --> 36:35.961
understand that they're safe.

36:35.994 --> 36:38.230
Sounds like
a fun place to work.

36:38.264 --> 36:40.366
WOMAN (on TV):
Talented employees
Ready to try this?

36:40.399 --> 36:41.900
come and go at Eukaryote...

36:41.933 --> 36:43.535
Hi. Good morning.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.837
So, we're here
to see that guy.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.540
Do you have an appointment?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.342
No, we don't.
But I think he'll see us--

36:50.376 --> 36:51.377
just tell him
we brought this.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.514
REBECCA:
Are you familiar
with the concept

36:55.547 --> 36:57.816
of a genetically targeted virus?

36:57.849 --> 36:59.451
They don't exist yet.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.887
Sure, I get the idea--
I do run a biolab.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.456
Actually, we think
there's been a breakthrough.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.625
We're investigating
the possibility that someone

37:06.658 --> 37:08.494
released a virus
targeting descendants

37:08.527 --> 37:11.630
of Genghis Khan
at a coffee shop uptown.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.566
Genghis Khan was not a good guy,
but it's a little late

37:14.600 --> 37:15.967
in the game for revenge,
don't you think?

37:16.001 --> 37:18.337
Well, it's not about revenge--
it was an attempt

37:18.370 --> 37:20.272
to kill an Army general
named Ram Ananda.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.973
If you're right,
that's terrifying.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.875
Who are you looking at,
foreign intelligence?

37:23.909 --> 37:24.810
REBECCA:
Ananda sat

37:24.843 --> 37:27.946
on an appropriations committee
for the Army.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.348
They have a vote
in a couple of weeks.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.283
And, among other things,

37:31.317 --> 37:33.619
they'll be deciding whether
or not to drastically reduce

37:33.652 --> 37:36.422
the budget for funding research
into biological weapons.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.325
Now, General Ananda had
the swing vote, but...

37:39.358 --> 37:41.593
he believes army resources
are better directed

37:41.627 --> 37:44.463
toward energy independence.
But if he dies,

37:44.496 --> 37:45.964
the man in line
to take his place

37:45.997 --> 37:48.033
is a hawk on biological weapons.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.369
This place of yours,

37:50.402 --> 37:51.670
Eukaryote...

37:51.703 --> 37:53.705
you have one client, right?

37:53.739 --> 37:55.307
The Army.

37:55.341 --> 37:57.909
So if that vote
goes the wrong way,

37:57.943 --> 38:00.679
then... everything
you've built is gone.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.815
That's absurd.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.617
We'd find work.
BRIAN:
Miles,

38:05.651 --> 38:07.419
you wrote your masters' thesis

38:07.453 --> 38:09.821
on the genetic marker
linked to Genghis Khan.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.089
I mean, I read it;
it was a good read.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.157
It was a little simplistic.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.692
I can see why you run the
business side of things.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.761
I'm gonna get my
lawyer on the phone.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.329
Although, to be honest,
I don't even think

38:17.363 --> 38:20.832
I need him here for this--
I'm waiting to hear a piece
of actual evidence.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.068
We have you on tape...

38:23.101 --> 38:24.470
spraying the virus.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.572
That's you.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.674
See the birthmark?

38:28.707 --> 38:30.342
BRIAN:
That virus your lab made,

38:30.376 --> 38:32.511
it's a massive breakthrough.
And there's no way

38:32.544 --> 38:33.979
you destroyed your research,
which means...

38:34.012 --> 38:37.082
the proof that you did this
is somewhere in the building.
This meeting

38:37.115 --> 38:39.351
is an opportunity for you
to give us those files.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.787
If you don't,
we can take that picture

38:41.820 --> 38:42.888
to a judge and get a warrant,

38:42.921 --> 38:45.090
but then you've lost
your only chance to cooperate.

38:45.123 --> 38:48.093
You'll be facing
three charges of murder.

38:50.862 --> 38:54.065
If you can get a judge
to believe that's me,

38:54.099 --> 38:57.068
you have evidence
of what?

38:57.102 --> 39:00.071
The fact that I used
an aerosol can?

39:00.105 --> 39:05.076
The virus, if it exists, leaves
no trace of itself behind.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.778
You have no evidence
of murder here,

39:06.812 --> 39:08.380
just a statistical quirk.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.716
You don't even have the
means to compel a warrant.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.618
And I suspect you know that...

39:12.651 --> 39:15.387
which is why you're trying
to bluff me.

39:20.492 --> 39:23.429
You know that didn't go well,
right, Brian?

39:23.462 --> 39:25.431
Oh, yeah, no.
We crashed and burned.

39:25.464 --> 39:28.400
That was really embarrassing,
but, honestly, ever since I saw

39:28.434 --> 39:31.503
that video in the lobby,
I really just want a
crack at his employees.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.171
Tag me in?
Sorry?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.106
Tag me in, real quick,
before I do this.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.141
Tag me in,
like that.
What?

39:36.174 --> 39:37.643
Aw, forget about it.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.411
(claps hands)
Uh, excuse me,
everyone. Hello?

39:39.445 --> 39:41.079
Guys.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.415
My name is Brian Finch.
How you doing?

39:43.449 --> 39:45.584
Um, this is Rebecca Harris.
We're from the FBI.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.519
What are you doing?
That sounds so cool.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.421
Um... show the badge.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.722
What are you doing?

39:50.756 --> 39:52.090
Show them the badge.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.660
The FBI badge.
I don't have a badge yet, so...

39:54.693 --> 39:56.695
Here, you're gonna have
to trust me, okay?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.730
(whispers):
These people
hate Miles Amos.

39:58.764 --> 40:02.133
I've had a lot of temp jobs,
and I took gym class.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.102
What?
I know a petty tyrant.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.771
Tag me in.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.007
Dope! Put it up.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.176
Listen, guys, it may have
come to your attention

40:11.209 --> 40:12.778
that you work for a douche.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.780
The "fire that
cleanses the forest"?

40:14.813 --> 40:16.147
What?!
Can you even believe that?

40:16.181 --> 40:17.949
But what you may not know

40:17.983 --> 40:20.552
is that you work
for a murderous douche.

40:20.586 --> 40:23.689
If you've been doing
research into genetically
targeted viruses,

40:23.722 --> 40:25.190
then your boss

40:25.223 --> 40:27.559
has used your work
to kill three people already.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.795
What are you two doing?
And the thing is, guys,

40:29.828 --> 40:31.997
we can't prove it right now
without the files.
Call security right now.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.098
So, if you hate
Miles Amos--

40:33.131 --> 40:36.502
and I know you do--
I'm offering you the opportunity

40:36.535 --> 40:38.604
to e-mail me those files
anonymously.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.038
Get the hell out of my building.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.240
All right? And if I'm wrong,
don't worry about it.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.943
No harm, no foul.
But if you think that man's

40:44.976 --> 40:48.046
capable of killing people,
e-mail me at...

40:49.180 --> 40:51.850
We don't have
an FBI e-mail for me?

40:51.883 --> 40:54.720
No.

40:56.221 --> 41:01.960
At... NinjaVersusBear
@ReabsorbedTwin.com.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.829
BRIAN:
N-I-N-

41:03.862 --> 41:05.797
(electronic ding)
J-A...

41:05.831 --> 41:07.999
Lookie here.
It's an e-mail from Eukaryote.

41:08.033 --> 41:10.235
(electronic ding)
BRIAN: Look at that.
And another one.

41:10.268 --> 41:14.573
And another one. Wow, man,
you got a morale issue.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.107
(electronic ding)
What's up, dude?
Remember when

41:16.141 --> 41:18.209
you weren't going to jail
five minutes ago? That was dope.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.711

(electronic ding)

41:19.745 --> 41:21.246
(ding)
Keep 'em coming, guys.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.955
It says "FBI" on it.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.257
It even has a lanyard,
so you can wear it

41:32.290 --> 41:33.124
around your neck.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.226
Or you can just put it
in your pocket.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.997
You earned it, Brian.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.800
We got a confession
from Miles Amos because of you.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.102
And we know what happened
to Stephen Fisher.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.837
But every time you act out,

41:45.871 --> 41:47.906
I'm the one
that cleans up your mess.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.576
You're an adult.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.943
Understand?

41:51.977 --> 41:54.680
Yeah, starting to.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.783
I thought you'd be happier.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.852
No, I am, I just...

42:03.188 --> 42:06.257
It's the lying.

42:06.291 --> 42:09.795
As long as we're doing this, I
don't see where it's gonna stop.

42:13.599 --> 42:16.568
Your dad used to be
an attorney, right?

42:16.602 --> 42:17.903
Yeah.

42:17.936 --> 42:19.971
Is he still licensed
by the bar?

42:20.005 --> 42:21.339
Yeah, I think so.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.609
So if you want to talk to him,

42:23.642 --> 42:26.144
why don't you hire him?

42:26.177 --> 42:27.579
You made a deal with us,

42:27.613 --> 42:31.650
but you're still entitled
to an attorney.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.084
(chuckles):
You still have the right

42:33.118 --> 42:35.621
to an attorney-client
privilege.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.188
I don't know the guy,

42:37.222 --> 42:39.691
but maybe he'll even
lower his fee for you.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.861
That's a good plan,
Agent Harris.

42:42.894 --> 42:46.231
(whistled melody nearby)
DENNIS:
Ten dollars?

42:46.264 --> 42:47.799
That's what you think I'm worth?

42:47.833 --> 42:49.134
Dad, just take it.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.902
Then you'll be my lawyer

42:50.936 --> 42:52.137
and then we can talk.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.839
Who is whistling?

42:53.872 --> 42:54.940
(laughs):
Mom doesn't whistle.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.074
That's my nurse.

42:56.107 --> 42:57.709
That's who they sent.
She's great.

42:57.743 --> 43:00.345
She just whistles.

43:00.378 --> 43:01.647
So, what's going on, Brian?

43:01.680 --> 43:03.248
NURSE:
Okay, Dennis,

43:03.281 --> 43:05.150
take your meds
before I go home.

43:06.885 --> 43:09.287
Sipiwe, this is my son, Brian.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.757
My nurse.

43:11.790 --> 43:14.893
EDDIE:
You describe it to the FBI,
to your parents, to anyone,

43:14.926 --> 43:16.828
I will let you die
more painfully and slowly

43:16.862 --> 43:18.029
than you can fathom.

43:18.063 --> 43:19.665
Your dad's doing great.

43:20.899 --> 43:23.001
Good.
As long as
he keeps taking

43:23.034 --> 43:25.036
his pills,
does everything

43:25.070 --> 43:26.772
we tell him to do,

43:26.805 --> 43:29.074
just the way
we tell him to do it,

43:29.107 --> 43:31.009
I think he'll make
a full recovery.

43:31.042 --> 43:34.079
There's no reason at all
to expect his health
to be compromised.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.147
Nice to meet you, Brian.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.054
Sit down.

43:46.024 --> 43:49.127
So... what'd you want
to tell me, kid?
