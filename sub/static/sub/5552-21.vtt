WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.546
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.713 --> 00:05.757
We got a warrant to search his office
and everything in it.

00:05.924 --> 00:07.759
I'm just not sure
there's much more to see.

00:07.926 --> 00:11.137
We're onto you. Dead people come here
and monsters come out.

00:11.304 --> 00:13.598
Rule number one, look after number one.

00:13.765 --> 00:16.768
Don't be crazy,
or you'll get yourself killed.

00:16.935 --> 00:19.437
Nice to have someone who cares about me.
Thank you.

00:19.604 --> 00:23.108
<i>Why do they keep
disappearing down that hallway?</i>

00:28.321 --> 00:29.322
Oh, my...

00:30.281 --> 00:31.282
<i>Look at the man
next to your father.</i>

00:31.449 --> 00:33.410
Hugo Strange. "The Philosopher."

00:33.576 --> 00:35.537
A friend. Someone he trusted.

00:35.704 --> 00:39.124
That's not fair. That's not right.

00:39.332 --> 00:40.333
<i>Have you seen the news?</i>

00:40.500 --> 00:42.419
Walking zombies in Gotham? What's new?

00:42.585 --> 00:44.963
Victor Fries and Theo Galavan
both went to Arkham as dead men.

00:45.130 --> 00:46.923
- Both returned.
- I don't care.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.091
So did your friend Bridgit.

00:48.258 --> 00:49.259
Bridgit Pike!

00:52.178 --> 00:53.513
<i>Wait, they sent her to Arkham?</i>

00:53.680 --> 00:54.848
<i>The only way we're gonna find out</i>

00:55.014 --> 00:57.100
<i>what's really going on in there
is if we break in ourselves.</i>

00:57.267 --> 00:58.268
<i>But I go alone.</i>

00:58.643 --> 01:00.270
- Whoa! Holy cow!
- Aah!

01:00.437 --> 01:01.980
- Forensic guy?
- Street trash girl?

01:02.147 --> 01:03.148
Where's Strange right now?

01:03.314 --> 01:05.150
<i>There's an elevator,
I'll tell you where it is.</i>

01:13.742 --> 01:16.286
<i>Freeze!</i>

01:18.371 --> 01:19.372
Bridgit?

01:19.539 --> 01:21.249
My name is Firefly.

01:27.046 --> 01:31.009
The sooner you stop moving,
the sooner this will be over.

01:31.843 --> 01:33.928
Thanks. No, thanks.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.513
You can't escape.

01:37.432 --> 01:38.475
Ah!

01:39.476 --> 01:41.519
<i>Enjoy yourself, Firefly.</i>

01:58.203 --> 02:00.246
You should feel honored.

02:04.292 --> 02:08.087
You are a sacrifice
to the Goddess of Fire.

02:12.050 --> 02:15.220
It's a blessing few receive.

02:24.938 --> 02:28.066
Man, Bridgit.
Someone sure scrambled your eggs.

02:51.965 --> 02:55.260
You're late, Selina.
I was starting to get worried.

02:56.219 --> 02:59.264
I'm not late.
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

03:02.851 --> 03:05.061
- Have you seen Selina?
- No.

03:06.396 --> 03:09.941
So, you're back to being a rich kid, huh?

03:11.192 --> 03:13.403
Why does your face look like that?

03:13.945 --> 03:15.196
Selina.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.825
She's in trouble and it's my fault.

03:29.502 --> 03:31.629
Regarding last night's
nocturnal activities,

03:31.796 --> 03:34.716
the suspect calling himself Azrael

03:35.174 --> 03:37.260
led a one-man assault upon Wayne Manor,

03:37.427 --> 03:42.015
whereupon an altercation ensued,
in which said suspect

03:42.974 --> 03:47.353
was blown up by a person
or persons unknown.

03:47.854 --> 03:50.315
So he's dead. Any questions?

03:50.481 --> 03:52.525
Can you confirm
that the man known as Azrael

03:52.692 --> 03:54.652
was, in fact, disgraced Mayor Galavan?

03:54.819 --> 03:56.988
Well, seeing as how
the suspect is now meat dust,

03:57.155 --> 03:59.157
a positive identification
would be difficult.

03:59.324 --> 04:01.075
How long are you acting captain?

04:01.242 --> 04:03.536
Until literally
the second someone else wants the job.

04:03.703 --> 04:06.164
- Who killed Galavan?
- Which time?

04:08.207 --> 04:11.169
Man. Give me Azrael, Galavan,

04:11.336 --> 04:13.755
whoever the hell he was,
over those jackals any day.

04:14.505 --> 04:18.217
- You need to bring in Hugo Strange.
- Oh, yeah? On what charge?

04:18.676 --> 04:20.803
- Since when do you care?
- Since I became acting captain

04:20.970 --> 04:24.057
of the GCPD and the whole damn city's
got me under a microscope.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.184
Besides which, we've been down this road.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.686
Strange is smart.
He'll have covered his tracks.

04:28.853 --> 04:31.648
It's pointless going into Arkham
unless we know what we're looking for.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.358
We can't get that unless we go in there.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.110
I hear you, brother,
but my hands are tied.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.446
Yeah? Well, mine aren't.

04:38.613 --> 04:41.574
Well, enjoy it,
because that's a luxury I don't have!

04:47.372 --> 04:48.873
<i>Detective Gordon.</i>

04:50.375 --> 04:51.709
I was hoping you'd be here.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.462
Bruce, you gotta stop
calling me detective.

04:55.171 --> 04:56.506
What is it?

04:56.673 --> 05:00.218
Selina. Hugo Strange has Selina.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.227
<i>Regarding last night's
nocturnal activities,</i>

05:09.394 --> 05:12.814
<i>the suspect calling himself Azrael</i>

05:13.773 --> 05:16.734
<i>led a one-man assault upon Wayne Manor,</i>

05:17.276 --> 05:20.446
<i>whereupon an altercation ensued
in which said suspect...</i>

05:20.613 --> 05:21.739
<i>Yes.</i>

05:21.906 --> 05:25.576
Strange is losing control.
We need to gather the court.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.453
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

05:48.516 --> 05:50.101
<i>We have a heartbeat.</i>

05:50.309 --> 05:51.477
He's waking up.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.566
Oh.

05:57.775 --> 05:58.776
Oh.

06:03.781 --> 06:04.949
Look at me.

06:07.368 --> 06:11.497
Good morning, son.
You're all right. I'm here.

06:14.042 --> 06:16.169
Can you tell me who you are?

06:17.045 --> 06:20.423
Can you tell me your name?

06:21.674 --> 06:23.134
Who am I?

06:25.011 --> 06:26.679
What is my name?

06:33.311 --> 06:36.105
Yeah.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.234
<i>Amazing.</i>

06:41.736 --> 06:43.654
The Octopod DNA we introduced

06:43.821 --> 06:46.824
provides exactly the effect
I was looking for.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.578
<i>Rest now, son.</i>

06:52.080 --> 06:56.834
I'll return momentarily.
To tell you who you are.

07:01.047 --> 07:03.174
What happened to me?

07:03.883 --> 07:08.179
That's the seventh subject you've woken up
in the past 12 hours.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.766
I assume he, like the others,
has no memory of his previous life.

07:11.933 --> 07:12.934
Yes.

07:13.101 --> 07:16.979
Perhaps the trauma of rebirth is simply
too much for the human mind to process.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.440
- You're not worried.
- Should I be?

07:19.607 --> 07:22.360
Professor, our employers
are going to shut us down.

07:22.527 --> 07:23.861
You must know this.

07:24.028 --> 07:27.365
What I know is what we've accomplished.
We've woken the dead.

07:27.573 --> 07:31.202
And yet, none have returned
with their memory intact.

07:31.369 --> 07:32.870
A tedious point.

07:33.037 --> 07:38.876
What's more preferable than giving them
personas that we design and control?

07:39.210 --> 07:43.923
An argument lost on our employers who care
about one thing and one thing only.

07:44.090 --> 07:48.219
You cannot order scientific discoveries
the way you order a steak, Ethel.

07:49.846 --> 07:53.724
Now, let's try subject 13, shall we?

08:07.363 --> 08:08.739
<i>How could you do this,
Master Bruce?</i>

08:08.906 --> 08:11.784
I strictly forbid you
from involving that little girl, didn't I?

08:11.951 --> 08:13.077
I know.

08:13.536 --> 08:15.580
But Selina's always handled herself.
I was sure.

08:15.746 --> 08:16.873
But you were wrong, weren't you?

08:17.039 --> 08:19.500
Well, it's different if you choose to be
involved in something like this,

08:19.667 --> 08:21.335
but you actively involved Selina Kyle.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.921
You put your own concerns
in front of that girl's safety.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.673
You're bang out of order!

08:27.758 --> 08:30.011
I'm really disappointed in you,
Master Bruce.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.348
You're sure she's still there?

08:34.765 --> 08:37.768
Yes. She wouldn't have missed
our meeting otherwise.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.437
Strange must be
holding her prisoner in Arkham.

08:39.604 --> 08:40.980
Only I doubt she's in Arkham.

08:41.439 --> 08:44.692
I wager Strange has her in the secret lab
where he created Azrael.

08:44.859 --> 08:47.695
But Strange runs Arkham.
He's seen there every day.

08:48.029 --> 08:49.989
The lab must be accessed through Arkham.

08:50.156 --> 08:52.200
- You're thinking it's underground.
- It has to be.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.369
There must be stairs, an elevator,
ventilation shafts.

08:55.745 --> 08:59.540
- I just don't know how to find them.
- I may have a solution.

08:59.707 --> 09:03.628
The technology Strange is using to create
these monsters must be very advanced.

09:03.794 --> 09:08.007
My guess is he's using plutonium isotopes
to mutate cell structure.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.426
If so, there'll be trace radiation.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.137
At Wayne Enterprises,
I developed a miniature Geiger counter

09:13.304 --> 09:14.347
for battlefield use.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.225
Get me into Arkham,
and I'll find the entrance to that lab.

09:19.185 --> 09:21.812
Wayne Foundation
gives the asylum money every year.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.147
I'll ask for a tour.

09:23.314 --> 09:25.441
From the man that ordered
the assassination of your father?

09:30.154 --> 09:31.781
He'll wanna find out what we know.

09:31.948 --> 09:33.908
And he won't see me
and Lucius as a threat.

09:34.075 --> 09:35.159
No.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.412
Absolutely bloody not. You're not to walk
straight into a lion's den.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.623
I can't even go to back you up
with a leg like this, can I?

09:40.790 --> 09:44.293
Alfred, you said yourself that it's
my fault what happened to Selina Kyle.

09:44.502 --> 09:46.545
That means it's my responsibility
to make it right.

09:47.672 --> 09:50.007
And I may not be the man
you choose as second in a street fight,

09:50.174 --> 09:52.677
but anything I can do
to protect Bruce, I will.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.513
Still, it's half a plan, isn't it?

09:56.013 --> 09:58.140
I mean, just say that Lucius
can get you in there,

09:58.307 --> 10:00.643
and you find the entrance
to the laboratory, then what?

10:00.810 --> 10:01.852
<i>They tell me.</i>

10:02.019 --> 10:05.731
I call Bullock, he comes busting in
with a hundred cops, keeps Strange busy.

10:05.982 --> 10:08.150
- I find Selina.
- I see.

10:08.818 --> 10:11.529
And how exactly do you plan on getting in?

10:11.696 --> 10:13.197
I mean, these two, possibly, but you?

10:13.364 --> 10:16.033
I mean, Strange won't let you
within a bloody mile of the place.

10:17.410 --> 10:21.163
If I can get you inside the gate,
can you manage the rest of the way?

10:21.330 --> 10:22.707
Yeah, I think I can.

10:25.376 --> 10:30.006
The cuttlefish is a fascinating creature.
Able to regenerate brain cells,

10:30.172 --> 10:36.512
secrete toxins from its skin,
and its DNA meshes so well with human.

10:37.013 --> 10:39.223
<i>I can't wait to see it in action.</i>

10:39.390 --> 10:42.226
Oh, I want to increase voltage
to her cortex.

10:42.727 --> 10:45.604
- Two hundred percent.
- Are you certain, sir?

10:45.813 --> 10:48.399
It'll be like she's being struck
by a bolt of lightning.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.027
Well, how much more damage
could we possibly do?

10:51.319 --> 10:52.737
She's dead.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.284
I'll see you when you wake, my dear.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.976
I'm so pleased you two are getting along.

11:24.685 --> 11:29.940
I should warn you, Mr. Nygma,
Mr. Stirk has been known to eat people.

11:31.484 --> 11:34.236
But he's promised to stop that,
haven't you, Mr. Stirk?

11:34.987 --> 11:37.948
You have to get me out of here!

11:38.199 --> 11:40.076
<i>Are you asking for a favor?</i>

11:40.451 --> 11:43.746
You should have considered that
before you decided to escape.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.666
How are you gonna stop Jim Gordon?

11:49.085 --> 11:50.252
What?

11:51.003 --> 11:54.632
Jim Gordon and the GCPD
have been here twice in the last week.

11:54.799 --> 11:58.386
- It's obvious that they know.
- Obvious they know what?

11:58.719 --> 12:00.012
Do I really have to say it?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.766
You're making monsters in the basement!

12:03.933 --> 12:06.477
- I'm hungry!
- Quiet, Stirk.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.980
Monsters in the basement?

12:11.649 --> 12:14.860
- You are insane, Mr. Nygma.
- Obviously.

12:15.736 --> 12:19.073
Jim Gordon is coming and you're gonna
need all the help that you can get.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.200
So why don't you go tell Strange

12:21.367 --> 12:23.327
that if he wants to stop Gordon
and the GCPD,

12:23.494 --> 12:24.537
then he's gonna need my help.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.331
Now!

12:40.261 --> 12:42.054
We have a heartbeat.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.983
<i>She's awake. She's awake.</i>

12:54.859 --> 12:57.403
<i>Quickly, go get Professor Strange.</i>

12:59.405 --> 13:01.532
Mr. Fox is pulling up, up front.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.203
I've told Gordon if I don't hear
from you within an hour,

13:07.037 --> 13:08.539
I'm gonna go straight to Bullock.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.793
I have to do this, Alfred.

13:13.294 --> 13:16.130
- I don't have a choice.
- Of course you got a choice.

13:16.547 --> 13:18.966
In the same way I can choose
to let you go with my blessing,

13:19.133 --> 13:21.177
and tell you to bring
that little girl home safe.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.845
Or I can take you right now,

13:23.012 --> 13:26.182
I can stick you on an airplane
and fly you somewhere very far away.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.516
- You can't.
- Don't be such a plonker.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.185
Of course I can.

13:30.728 --> 13:31.979
But I won't.

13:33.147 --> 13:36.108
You see, for the past two years,
Master Bruce,

13:36.275 --> 13:38.569
all I've tried to do is protect you
and keep you safe,

13:38.736 --> 13:40.488
thinking that's what your father wanted.

13:41.197 --> 13:44.158
But you're not the same boy
he left behind, are you?

13:46.076 --> 13:47.912
So, I have to ask myself,

13:49.538 --> 13:51.999
what would Thomas Wayne do
if he were here?

13:52.500 --> 13:56.295
Your father took responsibility
for his actions.

13:56.462 --> 13:59.381
He fought very hard
for what he believed in.

14:00.716 --> 14:04.303
And I will not stop you
from doing the same thing.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.598
So.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.101
Off you go.

14:12.937 --> 14:15.105
Gordon and Mr. Fox
will be waiting for you.

14:39.964 --> 14:42.550
Welcome back to the world, my dear.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.428
I imagine you're feeling rather confused.

14:49.265 --> 14:51.392
Can you tell me who you are?

14:53.852 --> 14:56.146
Do you remember your name?

14:57.982 --> 14:59.316
<i>Anything?</i>

15:05.114 --> 15:06.532
You are a war goddess.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.910
<i>- Your name is Andrast...</i>
- No.

15:12.288 --> 15:13.455
No?

15:13.622 --> 15:17.668
My name is Fish Mooney.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.713
I'm sorry.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.883
Could you please repeat that?

15:25.092 --> 15:28.512
I said my name is Fish Mooney, bitch.

15:28.679 --> 15:32.891
And you better tell me
what the hell is going on.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.615
<i>You're making a mistake
keeping me locked in here.</i>

15:49.950 --> 15:51.785
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

15:54.455 --> 15:57.875
What allowed her to come back
with her memories intact?

15:58.042 --> 15:59.209
It's too soon to tell.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.211
- Perhaps it was the increased voltage.
- Hmm.

16:01.378 --> 16:05.049
Something unique about the cuttlefish DNA
we spliced with her own.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.551
And then again,
she was pulled from that filthy river.

16:07.718 --> 16:10.679
Perhaps a contaminant from the water
altered the process.

16:10.929 --> 16:14.016
Early readings have detected abnormalities
in her brain function.

16:14.183 --> 16:17.144
Yes, she may reveal abilities.

16:17.394 --> 16:21.065
The most important thing is that she knows
who she is. Our masters will be pleased.

16:21.231 --> 16:24.902
We've created the first true reanimant.

16:26.070 --> 16:28.906
Have you made a decision
about Mr. Nygma's offer?

16:29.114 --> 16:31.241
Oh, yes. Let's let him have a go,
shall we?

16:31.408 --> 16:33.577
He was clever enough
to find his way to the basement.

16:33.744 --> 16:36.914
And he does have a point.
He knows Jim Gordon.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.294
I'll tell him.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.089
Bruce Wayne is at the front gate
asking for you.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.258
And he has someone
from Wayne Enterprises with him.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.760
Bold move.

16:50.761 --> 16:53.055
I'm more and more impressed with this boy.

16:53.222 --> 16:54.765
Shall I tell him you're not here?

16:54.932 --> 16:58.644
On the contrary,
I very much want to speak with him.

17:25.671 --> 17:27.381
Hugo Strange, at your service.

17:27.548 --> 17:29.299
- Lucius Fox.
- Mr. Fox.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.261
And of course, you are...

17:32.803 --> 17:33.971
Bruce Wayne.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.267
I can't tell you
what it means to finally meet you.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.644
Your father was very dear to me.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.189
<i>What happened to him and your mother
was indeed a great tragedy.</i>

17:44.481 --> 17:47.443
Please accept my condolences,
belated as they may be.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.950
Thank you.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.245
So, how can I be of help?

17:58.704 --> 18:01.457
It goes without saying that the work
we do here would not be possible

18:01.623 --> 18:03.834
without the support
of the Wayne Foundation.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.295
The asylum was a cause
close to my parents' hearts.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.673
As such, I believe it is my duty to see
how their money is being spent.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.675
So, this is bit of an inspection.

18:11.842 --> 18:14.845
No, nothing so formal.
We were just hoping for a look around.

18:15.596 --> 18:17.848
We don't normally give tours.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.934
Even to someone who provides
a quarter of your operating budget?

18:22.436 --> 18:26.690
Of course, we can make exceptions.
I'd be happy to be your guide.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.609
Actually, I thought
that you and I could talk,

18:28.776 --> 18:31.111
while Mr. Fox looks around.
He's very discreet.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.615
I see. You've come armed with a plan.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.952
I'm afraid we can't allow civilians
to wander about,

18:39.119 --> 18:42.998
but perhaps my assistant, Ms. Peabody,
could accompany Mr. Fox.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.542
That's fine, I'll just get my coat.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.921
Mr. Wayne, if you will.

18:59.348 --> 19:02.184
Bruce is going with Strange to his office,
while I get the tour.

19:02.351 --> 19:04.770
I see anything, I'll mark it with this.

19:07.815 --> 19:08.857
You're clear.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.419
This is expired.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.047
Yeah, I lost my new one.
Keep meaning to have it replaced.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.217
Do it today.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.276
This is our rec room.

19:52.442 --> 19:56.446
Where our inmates
work on their socialization skills.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.534
Who, um, designed the uniforms?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.370
Do you have much training
in mental health, Mr. Fox?

20:03.537 --> 20:05.080
None. None at all.

20:05.289 --> 20:07.124
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.

20:27.811 --> 20:31.982
Bruce, as much as I value the opportunity
to finally meet you,

20:32.149 --> 20:35.235
perhaps we could address
the real reason for your visit.

20:35.861 --> 20:37.154
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

20:38.697 --> 20:42.367
Well, you see, the other day,
James Gordon came to see me.

20:42.993 --> 20:46.622
He asked about a project that your father
and I worked on a decade ago.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.291
I was led to believe
that he was acting on your behalf.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.293
Is that not why you're here?

20:52.544 --> 20:53.837
After he left the GCPD,

20:54.004 --> 20:56.173
I retained Mr. Gordon
to look into my parents' deaths.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.469
He's been pursuing various leads,
and he doesn't share everything with me.

21:00.719 --> 21:05.098
If he overstepped or caused some offense,
you have my apologies.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.184
Thank you.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.979
And I can understand how you want answers.

21:11.355 --> 21:14.775
How difficult it must be to accept
that something so horrific,

21:14.942 --> 21:19.279
<i>as the murder of one's own parents
could be a random and meaningless act.</i>

21:21.031 --> 21:24.618
So, you want a reason. Someone to blame.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.539
In their case,
I think there was someone to blame.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.541
Oh, so do I.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.963
Sugar?

21:49.851 --> 21:53.814
Arkham Asylum has been open before
the days of water cures and trepanning.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.526
That's boring a hole in the skull
to release bad humors.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.945
We don't do that anymore.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.698
- What is that?
- Oh.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.659
This measures air quality.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.369
Microparticles.

22:07.536 --> 22:11.081
Mr. Wayne is concerned that the patients
are in a healthy environment.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.916
Asthma and whatnot.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.253
You're doing good so far.

22:16.461 --> 22:17.921
I'm so relieved.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.840
This way.

22:51.747 --> 22:53.915
<i>- Mr. Fox?</i>
- Yep.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.002
Coming.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.588
You remind me of him.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.049
Thomas.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.551
<i>You have that same look in your eyes.</i>

23:04.718 --> 23:07.554
- What look is that?
<i>- Certainty.</i>

23:08.221 --> 23:11.016
As a scientist,
that's a luxury that I cannot afford.

23:11.183 --> 23:14.728
No, in science, there must always be
some doubt, but not with Thomas. No.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.813
Thomas believed in things.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.110
I think what you're referring to
is moral principles.

23:22.277 --> 23:23.320
Yes.

23:24.654 --> 23:28.867
Sadly, science and moral absolutes
do not make easy bedfellows.

23:29.034 --> 23:33.497
Oh, the arguments we used to have.
I could never make him listen.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.832
I'm glad to hear that.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.709
Are you?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.670
<i>Haven't you ever imagined the life</i>

23:40.837 --> 23:44.216
that might have been
if your father hadn't been so certain?

23:44.466 --> 23:46.176
If he had listened?

23:46.593 --> 23:48.428
Then he wouldn't have been the man he was.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.764
True.

23:51.807 --> 23:53.600
But he wouldn't be dead, either.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.727
Along with your mother.

23:55.894 --> 23:59.564
Are those ideals
that your father cherished so worth it?

24:00.357 --> 24:04.361
Wouldn't you gladly trade everything
you believe for one more day,

24:04.528 --> 24:07.531
one more hour with your parents alive?

24:13.537 --> 24:16.832
So, you admit it then?
You admit what you did?

24:21.503 --> 24:23.547
Here's what I admit, Bruce.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.966
That I was your father's friend.

24:26.133 --> 24:28.969
That I pleaded with him,
as I plead with you now.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.179
Turn back.

24:32.556 --> 24:35.058
Surely you have those that you care about.

24:35.225 --> 24:37.727
For their sake, as well as your own,

24:38.937 --> 24:42.566
make the choice your father did not.

25:23.773 --> 25:26.067
You have been searching
for the man who killed your parents.

25:26.902 --> 25:30.071
But the answer has always been
right in front of you.

25:30.864 --> 25:34.284
Bruce, your father orphaned you.

25:35.285 --> 25:39.039
His actions fired the bullet
that killed him and your mother.

25:39.206 --> 25:42.792
He knew what he was doing,
and he did it anyway.

25:43.418 --> 25:47.881
I'm begging you not to follow his path.

25:54.304 --> 25:58.183
You want to know
if I wish my parents were alive?

25:59.601 --> 26:00.936
Of course.

26:02.354 --> 26:05.649
Would I give anything
to have them back? Yes.

26:06.149 --> 26:10.153
But my father fought and died
for what he believed was right.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.908
And if necessary,

26:17.452 --> 26:18.954
so will I.

26:31.383 --> 26:32.384
Take them.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.477
It seems you are your father's son.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.938
I want you to know
how greatly I respect that.

26:47.565 --> 26:50.652
Where's Selina Kyle?
What have you done with her?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.665
They got you locked up good in here.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.420
I'm gonna get us out of here, Bridgit.

27:08.962 --> 27:10.672
<i>Bruce is gonna find us. Hmm?</i>

27:11.423 --> 27:13.133
We'll get you help.

27:48.043 --> 27:49.169
Lunchtime.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.048
Where am I?

27:53.340 --> 27:54.341
Huh?

28:00.430 --> 28:02.182
This isn't an island, is it?

28:02.766 --> 28:05.435
Hey, lady, I just work here.
You want your lunch?

28:08.271 --> 28:09.939
You wanna make yourself useful?

28:10.106 --> 28:13.234
Make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.761
Someone will come
looking for the Wayne boy.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.263
Yes.

28:44.349 --> 28:45.809
You like him.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.979
He reminds me of Thomas.

28:51.314 --> 28:54.401
Whom I miss, ironic as that might seem.

28:55.026 --> 28:57.362
The boy is a threat.
You know what needs to be done.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.155
You don't have much time.

28:59.322 --> 29:01.157
<i>You have less than
you imagine.</i>

29:04.411 --> 29:05.412
Oh, no.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.914
<i>We need a word, Strange.</i>

29:08.581 --> 29:10.417
Of course, how might I be of service?

29:10.583 --> 29:13.586
<i>First the father, now the son.</i>

29:13.920 --> 29:16.798
<i>You have a habit of
catching the eye of the Wayne family.</i>

29:16.965 --> 29:20.135
- Everything is under control.
<i>- So you say.</i>

29:20.468 --> 29:22.554
<i>The fact is,
you've lost sight of your mission.</i>

29:22.720 --> 29:27.642
<i>Sending men with swords into Gotham.
Freaks armed with freeze guns.</i>

29:27.809 --> 29:31.896
There have been missteps, I grant you,
but look at all we've accomplished.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.190
<i>We do not care about your monsters.</i>

29:34.399 --> 29:37.444
<i>What do they have to do
with restoring the dead to life?</i>

29:37.944 --> 29:42.031
Physical regeneration has always been a
necessary part of bringing back the dead.

29:42.240 --> 29:46.202
I had to resort to any means necessary
to make humans stronger, faster...

29:46.369 --> 29:49.873
<i>Be that as it may,
you have failed at your core objective.</i>

29:50.540 --> 29:51.708
That is not true.

29:51.875 --> 29:56.671
<i>Immortality means returning to life
with one's mind and memories intact.</i>

29:57.005 --> 29:58.548
<i>And you have not.</i>

29:59.007 --> 30:00.216
Oh, but I have.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.511
<i>- When?</i>
- Today.

30:04.262 --> 30:05.722
I brought someone back.

30:06.055 --> 30:10.518
Memories, emotion, the soul itself.
Back from death.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.897
<i>- If you're lying...
- I am not.</i>

30:15.982 --> 30:18.067
<i>Can you repeat the process?</i>

30:19.486 --> 30:22.655
If given time, I believe so.

30:23.490 --> 30:24.574
<i>Very well.</i>

30:24.741 --> 30:28.244
<i>Find out what the Wayne boy
and his companions know.</i>

30:28.703 --> 30:31.789
<i>Move everything you can
to the facility upstate.</i>

30:31.956 --> 30:35.126
<i>Then destroy any evidence of Indian Hill.</i>

30:35.293 --> 30:38.421
- By destroy, you mean...
<i>- You have an explosive device.</i>

30:38.755 --> 30:39.923
<i>Use it.</i>

30:40.340 --> 30:42.425
<i>Destroy Indian Hill.</i>

30:48.097 --> 30:49.265
What's this?

30:49.474 --> 30:51.351
It's a grilled cheese sandwich.

30:53.394 --> 30:55.146
You made me a sandwich?

30:57.106 --> 30:58.274
Yeah.

31:06.824 --> 31:07.951
Why?

31:08.576 --> 31:09.619
I don't know.

31:10.328 --> 31:11.829
You told me to.

31:16.751 --> 31:17.752
Wait.

31:37.272 --> 31:39.315
I don't know what to do, Bridgit.

31:40.984 --> 31:42.235
It's simple.

31:43.653 --> 31:44.988
You can die.

31:46.698 --> 31:47.949
Drop it.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.577
Don't make me hurt you.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.371
You think you can hurt me?

31:53.538 --> 31:55.456
I am the Goddess of Fire.

31:55.623 --> 31:58.167
You're not the goddess of anything.
You're Bridgit.

31:59.002 --> 32:02.171
We grew up together. We're friends.
When my mom left, you took me in.

32:02.338 --> 32:03.923
- Goddesses don't have friends.
- Says who?

32:04.090 --> 32:05.508
The Professor.

32:05.675 --> 32:08.803
<i>- He told me who I am.</i>
- Screw him.

32:11.180 --> 32:14.684
<i>Remember the pigeons?
How we used to feed them?</i>

32:16.352 --> 32:19.480
It's me, Selina. You've gotta remember.

32:23.318 --> 32:24.360
I...

32:29.032 --> 32:33.202
Cale flamed up good,
but Joe burned the brightest.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.624
Okay. Yeah.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.209
Yeah, you fried your brothers.

32:40.585 --> 32:43.880
Not the memory I was hoping for,
but it's something.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.217
You'll burn bright.

32:49.844 --> 32:51.054
I know it.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.222
No, no.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.319
I am Firefly.

33:07.612 --> 33:09.572
Fire cannot touch me.

33:10.073 --> 33:11.741
Oh, crap.

33:14.577 --> 33:16.079
You're the Goddess of Fire, right?

33:16.829 --> 33:17.872
Right?

33:18.206 --> 33:20.083
Goddesses have servants and stuff.

33:20.249 --> 33:22.502
Let me be your servant.

33:28.925 --> 33:30.301
Why do I need a servant?

33:30.677 --> 33:32.929
You can't be a goddess without a servant.

33:33.888 --> 33:38.017
Come on, it's totally part of the story.
The Professor just forgot to tell you.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.187
<i>You gotta have a servant.</i>

33:42.271 --> 33:43.356
I guess that's true.

33:44.273 --> 33:45.441
Hello.

33:53.574 --> 33:54.867
Oh, man.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.287
Double shifts until I say otherwise.

33:58.454 --> 34:01.582
And I want everyone in a uniform
out on the streets.

34:01.749 --> 34:02.792
Bullock!

34:05.044 --> 34:07.797
Gordon, Master Bruce and Fox
are still in Arkham.

34:08.464 --> 34:09.799
They should be out by now.
They're in trouble.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.134
That son of a bitch!

34:12.051 --> 34:15.346
- Jim Gordon, I mean. He's forcing my hand.
- Are you listening to me?

34:15.513 --> 34:17.807
Grab your gun, your badge,
and your bits and your bobs and let's go.

34:17.974 --> 34:19.058
Hold on a second, okay?

34:19.225 --> 34:21.310
You're talking about a place
that's built like a fortress.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.187
Chockablock with armed guards.

34:23.396 --> 34:25.481
Now, while we could send in
an assault force

34:25.648 --> 34:29.277
of a pudgy middle-aged Irish detective
and a recently-stabbed Englishman,

34:29.485 --> 34:34.198
I think the Acting Captain of the GCPD
could do a little better.

34:40.538 --> 34:42.498
Right. Go get our guys.

34:42.749 --> 34:44.167
Bravo Team, on me.

34:56.721 --> 34:59.015
- Lucius.
- Bruce, are you okay?

34:59.182 --> 35:01.309
- I'm fine. Where's Gordon?
- I haven't seen him.

35:03.895 --> 35:05.688
I'm sorry I got you into this, Lucius.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.525
It seems likely
we're all going to die in here.

35:09.692 --> 35:10.735
Don't say that.

35:12.069 --> 35:13.654
I don't mind dying.

35:14.697 --> 35:17.867
I mind that I got you and Jim Gordon
and Selina Kyle involved.

35:18.034 --> 35:19.243
Bruce.

35:19.410 --> 35:20.828
You are a remarkable young man,

35:20.995 --> 35:22.580
but you didn't force any of us
to do anything.

35:22.747 --> 35:24.040
We chose.

35:28.211 --> 35:31.756
Hugo Strange said that all this time
I've been searching for the man

35:31.923 --> 35:33.758
who killed my parents,

35:37.136 --> 35:38.930
when really, it was my own father.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.602
That he knew what he was doing.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.775
That I am my father's son.

35:51.692 --> 35:55.238
Bruce, your father had the courage
to fight for what he believed in.

35:55.780 --> 35:58.282
And as long as there is life,
there is hope.

35:59.242 --> 36:01.035
<i>Touching sentiment.</i>

36:01.202 --> 36:03.037
Who are you? Where's Jim Gordon?

36:06.082 --> 36:08.251
Hmm, yeah.

36:08.417 --> 36:11.212
I would urge you to worry
about yourselves right now.

36:11.796 --> 36:14.173
Jim Gordon has his own problems.

36:15.758 --> 36:17.468
Strange, you son of a bitch!

36:17.760 --> 36:19.804
Where's Bruce Wayne? If you've hurt him...

36:19.971 --> 36:21.430
Bruce Wayne is alive.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.057
For now.

36:23.266 --> 36:25.935
Try me, and that may change.

36:26.435 --> 36:28.187
You won't get away with this.

36:28.771 --> 36:31.232
People know we're here.
They're already on their way to stop you.

36:31.399 --> 36:34.110
Yes, and I'm afraid
I simply can't allow that.

36:34.777 --> 36:36.946
The work that I'm doing here
is too important

36:37.113 --> 36:38.614
and at too critical a juncture.

36:38.781 --> 36:40.324
But fortunately,

36:40.491 --> 36:42.618
a solution has presented itself.

36:42.785 --> 36:43.911
Gentlemen.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.544
- What are you doing?
- Hold still.

37:05.474 --> 37:08.811
The solution is very important.
You mustn't spill a drop.

37:18.029 --> 37:19.614
<i>So, here's the situation.</i>

37:20.114 --> 37:22.742
Professor Strange has tasked me
with finding out

37:22.909 --> 37:25.661
how much you two know
about what he's been up to.

37:25.995 --> 37:28.539
And more importantly, who you told.

37:29.332 --> 37:31.500
Show us Jim Gordon and Selina Kyle.

37:31.667 --> 37:35.504
<i>I think you're not quite grasping
the power dynamic here, turtleneck.</i>

37:36.923 --> 37:41.594
As I was saying,
we need to know what you know.

37:42.845 --> 37:44.805
And you're gonna tell me.

37:45.473 --> 37:49.268
<i>Or poison gas will spew
from the nozzles above your head</i>

37:49.435 --> 37:51.354
<i>and you will both die very,</i>

37:52.188 --> 37:53.689
very painfully.

37:55.441 --> 37:58.444
I know this voice. He worked for the GCPD.

37:58.611 --> 38:00.363
<i>He had a funny kind of name.</i>

38:00.529 --> 38:03.282
There's nothing funny about my name.

38:03.532 --> 38:04.951
He was the one that framed Jim Gordon.

38:07.495 --> 38:09.664
You always were a smart cookie, Foxy.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.917
<i>Do you know why Strange gave me this job?</i>

38:13.084 --> 38:16.963
<i>It's because he knows that I would
kill you both and not bat an eye.</i>

38:17.380 --> 38:20.216
So, keeping that in mind,

38:21.801 --> 38:23.302
<i>five minutes on the clock.</i>

38:24.053 --> 38:25.137
Starting...

38:26.013 --> 38:27.139
Now.

38:32.561 --> 38:33.646
Fun.

38:44.448 --> 38:47.284
- What the hell was that?
- You'll see.

38:48.828 --> 38:50.579
Allow me to introduce Basil.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.873
Basil just woke up this morning,
didn't you, son?

38:53.249 --> 38:54.250
Yep.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.502
He was confused, poor soul.

38:56.711 --> 39:00.756
He had forgotten who he was,
until I reminded him of his great talent.

39:00.965 --> 39:03.259
You see, Basil is a gifted performer.

39:03.592 --> 39:06.637
A chameleon of sorts.
Would you like to see?

39:08.431 --> 39:10.683
You belong in your own asylum, Strange.

39:10.850 --> 39:14.061
And you, James Gordon, belong in the past.

39:15.021 --> 39:16.689
The world has moved on.

39:17.398 --> 39:21.819
While you and others like you
were living your sad, normal lives,

39:21.986 --> 39:24.739
I was pushing the boundaries of evolution.

39:25.364 --> 39:30.786
The future belongs to my children
and that future is here.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.605
<i>Inbound to Arkham Asylum.
Strike force ready.</i>

40:00.316 --> 40:01.692
<i>Tell me what you know.</i>

40:47.696 --> 40:49.240
Astonishing.

40:56.705 --> 40:58.290
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

40:58.457 --> 40:59.750
The finishing touch.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.217
Introduce yourself, son.

41:08.384 --> 41:09.510
Nice to meet you.

41:10.845 --> 41:11.971
What the hell?

41:12.138 --> 41:13.597
Nice to meet you.

41:14.807 --> 41:17.226
- You son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch.

41:17.685 --> 41:18.894
Nice to meet you.

41:19.395 --> 41:20.896
I'm Jim Gordon.

42:04.857 --> 42:05.858
English - SDH
