listened to me when I spoke.

And he wanted to know
what I was feeling.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.541
I stopped that kiss
because it was

Well, this sucks.

Well, at least your family just
started sucking now.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.712
Mine's sucked

got divorced.

my parents were great,

they're just people.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.476
It still sucked, though.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.145
Yeah, I mean, it's not fair.

23:16.187 --> 23:19.106
You know, none
of this is fair.
Yeah.

whoever was responsible
for the break-in.

No, don't, don't
thank me yet.

As of now, your life
outside of school is over.

29:20.676 --> 29:24.221
No going out, no car,
no cell phone except

29:24.263 --> 29:25.556
for in emergencies.

29:25.598 --> 29:28.267

You got it?

29:34.814 --> 29:37.817
Yeah.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.903
Did you tell Mom?

29:39.945 --> 29:43.365
No, no, your mom's got
a lot going on right now.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.200

you're not going out,

this is my house,

30:14.146 --> 30:15.689

30:15.731 --> 30:19.109

30:19.151 --> 30:22.237
about turning the carriage
house into a gym.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.573
Put my elliptical machine over
there, the free weights

30:24.615 --> 30:27.576

corner...

I work on my boat.

for a young man to spend

30:49.807 --> 30:51.891
all of his time
alone in a shed.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.477
That's why, when she goes away

30:53.519 --> 30:56.563

gonna start my renovations.

30:57.939 --> 31:00.359
Mom's going to Europe?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.777
What, she didn't tell you?

31:01.819 --> 31:04.154
Yeah, she's going on
a spa week in Switzerland.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.323
You know, at first

31:06.365 --> 31:10.452
she was actually hesitant
to leave us here alone.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.329
But I promised her
that we'd be fine.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.957
So it's just gonna be you
and me alone, for a week.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.250
I can hardly wait.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.964
(clattering)

31:42.568 --> 31:43.777
So, how was your day?

31:46.739 --> 31:47.906
Uh, it was fine.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.366
Yeah, you know,

31:49.408 --> 31:50.617
but fine.

31:50.659 --> 31:51.869
How was your day?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.621
Good. Oh, funny
thing happened.

31:54.663 --> 31:55.706
I ran into Cindy

31:55.748 --> 31:56.874
at Trader Joe's.

31:56.915 --> 31:57.957
Do you remember her
from the fundraiser

31:57.999 --> 31:59.042
last month?
Oh, yeah.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.960
Yes, how is she?

32:01.002 --> 32:02.629
Good, she looks good.

highlights in her hair.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.385
But we just sat down.
You hardly touched your food.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.721
I'll take my plate with me.
I just have a lot of studying

32:10.763 --> 32:12.972

32:31.700 --> 32:34.870
Well, okay. Why?

32:34.912 --> 32:36.246
I'm grounded.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.915
You're grounded for what?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.999
Nothing.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.086
Well, okay, I mean, if you're
not grounded for anything,

32:43.128 --> 32:44.755
then why can't we hang?

32:44.797 --> 32:46.590

talk about it right now.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.383
Okay?

32:48.425 --> 32:49.593
Fine, whatever, Dixon.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.094
I'll see you tomorrow
at school, okay?

32:55.808 --> 32:57.267
(knocking on door)

32:57.309 --> 32:59.603
What's up?

32:59.645 --> 33:02.021
So, dinner was pretty awkward.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.443
And listen,
I think it's because...

33:06.485 --> 33:08.403
I'm sorry,
I've had a really bad day.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.949
Can we not talk about this?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.701
Uh, yeah, sure.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.202
No problem.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.966
Hey, Dad, listen,
um, I've been thinking
about the tackle shop.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.050
Ah, don't worry about it, kid.
I'll figure it out.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.218
It's just gonna take some time.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.638
Maybe I can help
speed things up.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.558
I appreciate the gesture,

33:38.600 --> 33:40.894
but it's gonna take
a lot more than 30 cents.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.229
These are worth a lot
more than 30 cents.
