WEBVTT

00:09.835 --> 00:12.055
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

00:12.099 --> 00:13.796
KESTRA:
I don't totally get it.

00:13.839 --> 00:16.494
But I do know something
really bad happened to you.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.409
You don't have
a mom and a dad.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.932
You have Captain Picard.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.847
I don't have Picard.But you could.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.588
And he could have you.

00:23.632 --> 00:24.720
And you could both
have each other.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.461
RIOS:
I already had one

00:26.504 --> 00:28.115
grand, heroic captain
in my life.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.421
The last thing I need
is another one.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.945
Ten years on, I still can't
close my eyes at night

00:32.989 --> 00:35.861
without seeing
the last one's blood and brains

00:35.905 --> 00:38.081
splattered all over a bulkhead.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.695
We are gonna take this cube
away from them forever.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.220
That sounds like
a treaty violation to me.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.267
HUGH:
Activate the Queencell...

00:50.311 --> 00:54.097
SEVEN OF NINE:
In case you ever need
a vigilante...

00:54.141 --> 00:56.708
What is the nature
of your medical emergency?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.145
Deactivate EMH.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.845
I wish I didn't know
what I know.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.716
I wish they hadn't shown me.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.372
Narek, the Tal Shiar agent,

01:08.416 --> 01:11.375
was looking for an implanted
memory of a real place.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.117
And when I told him about
the lightning and the moons,

01:14.161 --> 01:16.728
he said, "You found home."PICARD:
I want

01:16.772 --> 01:19.601
to help you to get
back to that home.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.604
RIOS:
Somebody's tailing us.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.693
Must be since we left the cube.

01:45.061 --> 01:49.239
OH:
Our foremothers
came to this system

01:49.283 --> 01:51.328
looking for an answer

01:51.372 --> 01:55.071
to the riddle
of the Eightfold stars.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.988
What they found
was a storehouse

01:59.031 --> 02:04.124
of preserved memories
that showed them the grim fate

02:04.167 --> 02:09.259
of the civilization
that perished here long ago.

02:09.303 --> 02:12.784
We still do not know
the name of the mighty race

02:12.828 --> 02:17.615
who left behind this object,
this Admonition,

02:17.659 --> 02:22.446
warning us of the horror
and annihilation

02:22.490 --> 02:24.231
that came from the skies.

02:24.274 --> 02:28.148
When our foremothers
first endured the Admonition,

02:28.191 --> 02:31.107
we, the Zhat Vash, were born.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.415
For hundreds of years since,

02:34.458 --> 02:35.981
we have worked in shadow

02:36.025 --> 02:39.898
to prevent a second coming

02:39.942 --> 02:42.814
of the Destroyers.

02:42.858 --> 02:46.427
It is this dreaded work

02:46.470 --> 02:50.648
that you must now carry on.

02:50.692 --> 02:55.000
What you are about to experience
will drive some of you mad.

02:55.044 --> 02:58.656
But those of you who endure

02:58.700 --> 03:01.920
will be stronger.

03:03.139 --> 03:06.360
Witness the devastation
that must be prevented.

03:07.883 --> 03:10.320
Endure the Admonition...

03:12.627 --> 03:14.716
...if you can.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.705
No more...

04:16.473 --> 04:18.562
We have to stop them.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.999
We will.

04:22.479 --> 04:23.872
How?

04:25.787 --> 04:27.397
Where do we begin?

04:27.441 --> 04:32.402
On the world
the humans call Mars.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.538
Auntie?

04:37.581 --> 04:38.974
Auntie.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.457
No...

04:49.550 --> 04:51.552
We have our work to do.

05:05.479 --> 05:10.092
NARISSA:
Dr. Kabath says there's no
medical reason for this, Auntie.

05:10.135 --> 05:13.487
I do believe you're malingering.

05:15.097 --> 05:20.189
You were never entirely sane
to begin with, were you?

05:21.016 --> 05:23.105
It was folly,

05:23.148 --> 05:26.238
taking in Narek and me
after our parents died.

05:26.282 --> 05:32.332
And sheer madness, submitting
yourself for Admonishment.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.379
Though when you lost your mind,

05:36.423 --> 05:40.165
you certainly did it
with panache.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.345
Breaking a Borg cube

05:45.388 --> 05:50.001
by the sheer force
of your despair?

05:50.045 --> 05:52.830
The Collective picked
the wrong Tal Shiar ship

05:52.874 --> 05:55.920
to assimilate that day.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.186
They ought to have picked mine.

06:01.230 --> 06:04.189
I'd have made a much
better Borg than you.

06:04.233 --> 06:08.933
"Resistance is futile."

06:15.157 --> 06:19.204
Narek's located
the synthetics' nest.

06:19.248 --> 06:22.512
I've dispatched ships.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.862
I'll be joining them
as soon as I've shut down

06:24.906 --> 06:27.299
this house of horrors.

06:30.215 --> 06:35.612
If you wake up,
you can come along.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.490
We have our work to do.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.773
Tell me you found the freak.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.427
TARENT:
Yes, Colonel.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.298
We tracked him to the office
of the former director

07:09.341 --> 07:10.821
of the Reclamation Project.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.434
Where's Hugh?

07:59.653 --> 08:02.046
What is happening on this cube?

08:06.050 --> 08:08.705
All right. I'm here.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.751
It's-it's all right.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.462
PICARD :
Rios?

09:56.857 --> 09:59.337
Rios?

10:02.863 --> 10:05.474
Rios, this is Dr. Asha.

10:07.171 --> 10:10.348
I need a secure
subspace link...

10:13.264 --> 10:14.614
Rios?

10:16.311 --> 10:17.442
Hey!

10:17.486 --> 10:18.922
Rios!

10:18.966 --> 10:20.532
What?

10:20.576 --> 10:24.536
I need a secure subspace link
to Starfleet Command.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.886
BOTH:
What?

10:25.929 --> 10:28.236
And what's the nearest starbase?

10:29.759 --> 10:31.718
Uh, Deep Space 12?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.763
Lay in a course.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.462
Hey.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.029
Lay in a course.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.165
I will lay in a course for DS12.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.297
But after that,
you're on your own, Picard.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.517
I'm done.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.432
You said you'd take me home.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.390
Yes, and I will.

10:52.434 --> 10:55.742
But we face a powerful enemy.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.005
We can't do it without support.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.746
Look,

10:59.789 --> 11:02.139
you have no choice
but to trust me.

11:02.183 --> 11:06.404
And I know, that would
make me angry, too, but...

11:06.448 --> 11:08.363
I understand.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.757
Let me find you a cabin.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.151
U-Uh, hi.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.500
Raffi.

11:15.544 --> 11:16.719
Soji.

11:16.763 --> 11:17.981
RAFFI:
Soji,

11:18.025 --> 11:19.591
I'm sorry, but your new
best friend Jean-Luc

11:19.635 --> 11:22.986
already brought us one adorable
little homicidal double agent.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.379
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:24.422 --> 11:26.729
I'm talking about how big
a fool you really are.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.035
Yeah-- Come.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.776
I'm sorry about her rudeness.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.648
Raffi!

11:32.692 --> 11:33.780
A neuron.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.303
That's all you
know about her.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.349
You built this whole giant
fantasy of-of rescue

11:38.393 --> 11:39.960
and sacrifice and redemption

11:40.003 --> 11:41.962
out of one pissant
little neuron.

11:42.005 --> 11:45.443
Now you put that away
or be prepared to use it on me.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.666
Agnes Jurati had
a tracking isotope in her blood.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.102
She's a Romulan spy.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.930
Fact or theory?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.150
Theory.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.717
Come.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.415
We think she killed
Bruce Maddox.

12:04.549 --> 12:07.596
Who is "we"?

12:07.639 --> 12:10.642
She injected herself
with a hydrogen compound.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.993
She was trying to destabilize
the viridium tracker

12:13.036 --> 12:14.821
already present in her system.

12:14.864 --> 12:18.302
And as soon as she did,
we shook our Tal Shiar tail.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.174
Fact, not theory.

12:20.217 --> 12:24.482
But t-to say that
she's a Tal Shiar agent?

12:24.526 --> 12:27.007
Maybe she didn't know about
the viridium until you picked up

12:27.050 --> 12:28.878
the tail.Maybe.

12:28.922 --> 12:33.317
Or maybe they put her on
this ship to kill Bruce Maddox.

12:33.361 --> 12:36.668
Right after they got done
killing Soji's sister.

12:36.712 --> 12:37.974
Tell me about Maddox.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.497
His injuries need
not have been fatal.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.629
She deactivated me.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.196
Mm-hmm.
Then,

12:42.239 --> 12:44.024
she turned off the hematic
microrepair unit

12:44.067 --> 12:46.853
that was stabilizing
his cardiovascular function.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.506
She was in distress.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.945
I-I told you it was careless
to bring her along.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.511
Now you're telling us
that we need to trust

12:53.555 --> 12:54.730
the synth girl, too?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.732
Tell me, JL.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.430
What is Soji really like?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.128
Hmm?

13:01.171 --> 13:02.999
Do you know?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.176
Does she?

13:08.962 --> 13:12.008
Yeah, that's what I thought.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.315
Where are you going, Raffi?

13:14.358 --> 13:16.970
To tell Rios I was right
about Jurati.

13:17.013 --> 13:20.843
I'm gonna see if it feels any
better to rub hisface in it.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.460
CLANCY:
That's a hell of a report.

13:29.504 --> 13:32.246
And you thought I was
a desperate old man.

13:32.289 --> 13:35.815
Quixotic, paranoid,
possibly senile.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.251
Let's just leave it at quixotic.

13:37.294 --> 13:41.646
And now the windmills have
turned out to be giants.

13:41.690 --> 13:42.909
You want an apology?

13:42.952 --> 13:44.562
I want a squadron.
Jean-Luc?

13:44.606 --> 13:46.216
Clancy! Out there,

13:46.260 --> 13:48.349
in the Vayt System, right now,

13:48.392 --> 13:51.265
beings who have as much
right to life and liberty

13:51.308 --> 13:53.876
as you and I or Commander Data

13:53.920 --> 13:55.878
are being hunted
down by an enemy

13:55.922 --> 13:57.445
who seeks to exterminate them.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.447
Jean-Luc!No! Clancy, if you say this

13:59.490 --> 14:01.797
is not a job for Starfleet,
then I'm sorry,

14:01.841 --> 14:03.190
but you are a waste of space!

14:03.233 --> 14:04.800
Admiral Picard,
with all due respect,

14:04.844 --> 14:05.845
and at long last,

14:05.888 --> 14:07.934
shut the fuck up.

14:07.977 --> 14:11.154
I'm sending a squadron to
rendezvous with you at DS12.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.591
Now, stay put
until they get there.

14:13.635 --> 14:16.203
Clancy out.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.945
Hmm.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.816
You all right, buddy?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.688
You seemed a little, uh,
rattled back there.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.473
: Tell me
how I can help you.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.649
The Tal Shiar had a tracker

14:27.692 --> 14:29.042
inside your girl Jurati.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.827
And it looks like
she killed Bruce Maddox.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.612
Well, that's bad news.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.440
Uh, yeah.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.703
Unless you like

14:38.747 --> 14:39.922
giant, all-encompassing,

14:39.966 --> 14:41.358
paranoid conspiracy theories.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.230
Then it's, you know,
kind of awesome,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.493
you know, in a horrible way.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.974
In bad situations,
it's so important

14:48.017 --> 14:50.367
to try and find
something positive.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.021
Goddamn it!

14:52.065 --> 14:53.762
Which one are you?

14:53.805 --> 14:55.459
Navigation.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.940
ENH-- call me Enoch.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.594
Where is Rios?

14:59.637 --> 15:01.857
After he laid in the course
for Deep Space 12,

15:01.901 --> 15:05.382
he activated us holograms
and went to his quarters.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.645
Did he tell you why he got
so freaked out by that girl?

15:07.689 --> 15:09.952
No, but...

15:09.996 --> 15:11.084
...he said if I kept
smiling at him,

15:11.127 --> 15:12.868
he would punch me
in the face.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.609
Let me see if I can

15:14.652 --> 15:16.350
identify her for you.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.701
Yes!

15:19.744 --> 15:22.356
Her name is...

15:22.399 --> 15:23.705
Jana.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.794
Hmm, her name is Soji.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.362
Ask me about
astronavigation!

15:32.018 --> 15:33.802
This, uh,
this caught my eye

15:33.845 --> 15:35.195
while I was surveilling
the cube.

15:35.238 --> 15:38.024
All these Romulans sitting
around drawing this,

15:38.067 --> 15:39.982
over and over.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.898
Eight circles, see?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.334
Could those be planets?

15:44.378 --> 15:46.989
Looks an attempt to
depict an octonary.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.512
A what, now?

15:48.556 --> 15:52.168
A planetary system with
eight component stars.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.388
This is Nu Scorpii,

15:54.431 --> 15:57.217
a septenary system,
which are extremely rare.

15:57.260 --> 16:00.350
But an octonary?
Hmm?

16:01.656 --> 16:03.005
There are accounts of one

16:03.049 --> 16:06.530
in some ancient Romulan
star atlases, but...

16:06.574 --> 16:08.315
they're considered
apocryphal.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.318
They don't appear in any
of their modern charts.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.799
The gravitational mechanics
would have to be...

16:14.843 --> 16:17.672
incredibly complex.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.024
All-all-all this time
I've been thinking

16:22.068 --> 16:25.245
that the Conclave of Eight
was eight people

16:25.288 --> 16:28.204
who planned the attack on Mars,
but maybe the name

16:28.248 --> 16:31.512
refers to the place
where they met.

16:35.124 --> 16:38.388
You are my favorite holo.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.523
Hmm.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.700
NARISSA:
Killed by a phaser.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.747
The boy has a confederate.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.236
Fenris Rangers.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.718
And it's not hard
to guess which one.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.768
Why didn't you go with them?

17:10.812 --> 17:12.118
Picard released me.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.250
I found a cause even
more lost than his.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.559
Is this where
the Borg Queen lived?

17:18.602 --> 17:20.996
No.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.303
But she used to
visit sometimes?

17:23.346 --> 17:26.523
I can explain,
or I can steal this cube.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.908
What the hell
is going on?

18:03.952 --> 18:06.041
The cube,
it seems to be...

18:06.085 --> 18:08.348
I would almost say
it's regenerating.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.176
We have to get rid
of every Borg

18:10.219 --> 18:11.786
still held in stasis
immediately.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.570
Can they be gassed?

18:13.614 --> 18:15.355
Electrocuted?

18:15.398 --> 18:17.052
We can blow the seals
and jettison them

18:17.096 --> 18:18.662
directly into space.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.055
Oh, I like that.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.143
See to it.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.362
Yes, Colonel.

18:22.405 --> 18:25.278
I'll get started on the xBs.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.410
I'll need this one, too.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.934
Come.

18:56.613 --> 18:57.658
Is it all right?

18:57.701 --> 18:59.355
It's good.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.618
Is there something you'd prefer?

19:02.663 --> 19:05.144
Honestly, I don't know.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.802
You don't know what it's like

19:11.846 --> 19:15.719
to have this vacuum
inside of you, Picard.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.982
To have someone ask
if you like eggs,

19:18.026 --> 19:20.768
and have no idea
if the answer

19:20.811 --> 19:22.248
is coming from you

19:22.291 --> 19:24.075
or your
instruction set.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.599
You're right.

19:25.642 --> 19:29.124
I don't know what that's like.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.995
I can only try

19:31.039 --> 19:34.042
and imagine it.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.609
Your memories,

19:35.652 --> 19:36.958
your history,

19:37.001 --> 19:39.221
to you, feel like

19:39.265 --> 19:41.528
incidents you heard about.

19:41.571 --> 19:44.531
Something that happened
to someone else.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.186
Yes.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.883
You feel that you

19:48.926 --> 19:50.711
don't have a past anymore.

19:50.754 --> 19:51.842
Because I don't.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.148
Oh, that's not true.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.932
You have a past.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.152
You have a story...

19:57.196 --> 19:59.850
just waiting to be claimed.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.288
You're talking about Data.

20:02.331 --> 20:05.247
Among other things, yes.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.990
All right.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.949
Tell me about Data.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.951
What was he like?

20:13.995 --> 20:17.955
Well, Data was... brave.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.044
Curious.

20:20.088 --> 20:23.134
Very gentle.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.963
He had a child's wisdom,

20:26.007 --> 20:28.923
unclouded
by habit

20:28.966 --> 20:30.359
or bias.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.927
He made us all laugh...

20:32.970 --> 20:36.713
e-except when he was
trying to make us laugh.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
And you loved him.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.633
I, uh...

20:45.809 --> 20:47.202
Yes.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.160
In my way.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.685
Did he love you?

20:53.643 --> 20:57.212
Data's capacity for expressing

20:57.256 --> 21:00.911
and processing emotion
was limited.

21:03.087 --> 21:06.395
I suppose we had that in common.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.490
If I could see you
with his eyes...

21:14.534 --> 21:16.884
with his memories...

21:16.927 --> 21:18.538
what would I see?

21:18.581 --> 21:20.975
How would I know that?

21:21.018 --> 21:22.846
What do you hope
I would see?

21:22.890 --> 21:25.327
How do you wish
he would remember you?

21:25.371 --> 21:27.895
You mean, if he had survived me,

21:27.938 --> 21:30.811
rather than
the other way around.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.683
I hope he would
remember

21:33.727 --> 21:37.644
Jean-Luc Picard as someone
who believed in him.

21:37.687 --> 21:40.516
Who believed in his potential.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.389
Uh, celebrated his successes.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.479
Counseled him when
he fell short.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.132
Helped him if he needed help

21:48.176 --> 21:50.265
and, if he didn't need it...

21:50.309 --> 21:52.311
got out of his way.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.967
Words to that effect.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.371
He loved you.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.951
Chris?

22:23.994 --> 22:25.474
Are you Chris?

22:25.518 --> 22:27.781
No, lassie, I'm the Emergency

22:27.824 --> 22:30.740
Engineering Hologram,
but I go by Ian.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.960
First of all, I'm gonna ask you
never to call me "lassie" again.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.092
Duly noted.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.398
Have you seen Rios?

22:36.442 --> 22:37.660
No.

22:37.704 --> 22:40.315
Captain's still hiding out
in his cabin.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.448
"Hiding out"?

22:42.491 --> 22:44.101
From what?

22:44.145 --> 22:45.320
From Soji?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.408
I dinna ken for sure,

22:46.452 --> 22:48.279
but I wouldn't be surprised.

22:48.323 --> 22:51.848
Sight of that lassie's bound
to stir up unwelcome memories.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.328
And why is that?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.504
Where does he know her from?

22:58.420 --> 23:00.814
I do not have
the faintest notion.

23:00.857 --> 23:04.905
I ken it's true,
but I dinna ken why.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.123
Mm.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.864
Lot of that going around.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.520
Engineering, right?

23:11.564 --> 23:13.043
Let me ask you
something.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.524
What are the chances
that an octonary star system

23:15.568 --> 23:17.439
would occur naturally?

23:17.483 --> 23:20.007
Close to...

23:20.050 --> 23:21.487
close to nil, I'd say.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.098
Meaning it would have
to be built?

23:24.141 --> 23:25.447
You'd have to

23:25.491 --> 23:26.927
capture eight suns,

23:26.970 --> 23:29.625
move them across
light-years of space,

23:29.669 --> 23:32.672
and set 'em in motion.

23:32.715 --> 23:33.586
Why...

23:33.629 --> 23:35.457
why would you want to do that?

23:35.501 --> 23:37.198
Showing off?

23:37.241 --> 23:39.722
Saying, look what I can do!

23:41.463 --> 23:43.900
Or maybe you had something

23:43.944 --> 23:45.946
really important to say,
and you wanted to make sure

23:45.989 --> 23:48.296
that people were
paying attention.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.080
Like...

23:50.124 --> 23:52.822
if you wanted
to leave them a warning.

23:52.866 --> 23:53.693
Oh...

23:53.736 --> 23:55.695
I'm getting closer, Ian.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.349
I can, I can feel it.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.568
Aye.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.049
And how's it feel?

24:02.092 --> 24:05.574
Absolutely terrifying.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.838
Burgundy.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.929
Red wine.

24:12.973 --> 24:16.846
What is the nature of your
hospitality emergency?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.805
I-I need a glass of red wine.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.895
You disabled alcohol service
from your quarters two days ago.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.897
Well, reinstate it-- override.

24:23.940 --> 24:27.466
Locked yourself
out of override and...

24:27.509 --> 24:29.729
out of meta-override.

24:29.772 --> 24:33.080
Then shoot me in the head.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.431
What's with Rios?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.302
Should I be worried about him?

24:38.346 --> 24:40.609
He could use someone
to talk to.

24:40.653 --> 24:43.090
Someone who doesn't
look exactly like him,

24:43.133 --> 24:45.092
only better groomed.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.963
How do you know that?

24:47.007 --> 24:49.575
Are you all networked
directly to Rios?

24:49.618 --> 24:51.664
When Captain Rios
acquired La Sirena,

24:51.707 --> 24:53.796
he selected
the self-scan option.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.581
He claims it was an accident,

24:55.624 --> 24:58.148
but he never bothered
to revert it, so...

24:58.192 --> 25:02.544
So you're all Rios, overlaid
on the five basic installs?

25:02.588 --> 25:04.459
Not, not, not precisely.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.287
He went in later
and made some deletions.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.941
Careless ones, I must say.

25:07.984 --> 25:10.857
Ask me the proper temperature
for making Yridian tea.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.467
I no longer have any idea.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.077
In any case,
it's hard to explain,

25:14.121 --> 25:16.036
but I am aware,

25:16.079 --> 25:17.951
or rather, my algorithms
allow me to predict

25:17.994 --> 25:19.996
with a high degree
of confidence,

25:20.040 --> 25:23.347
that Captain Rios
is in sore need

25:23.391 --> 25:27.264
of a confidant,
right about now.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.547
RAFFI:
Rios, honey?

26:32.591 --> 26:33.766
It's Raffi.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.332
Thought you might need
some company.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.639
Piss off!

26:37.683 --> 26:40.337
Pissing off.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.560
These are the ones
Hugh reclaimed.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.172
Thousands more
are still in stasis.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.390
Wake them up.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.696
They'll be useless.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.872
Lost without the voice
of the Collective.

27:40.484 --> 27:46.099
I could reactivate and reconnect
their transceivers.

27:46.142 --> 27:48.057
Create a kind of
micro-collective

27:48.101 --> 27:49.755
of just the Borg
on this cube.

27:49.798 --> 27:52.148
Coordinate their movements,

27:52.192 --> 27:54.629
deploy them against
the Romulan troops.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.762
That sounds amazing.
Do that.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.938
Assimilate them?

27:58.981 --> 28:01.984
Invade their minds,
suppress their identities,

28:02.028 --> 28:04.291
enslave them-- again?

28:04.334 --> 28:05.945
You can release them
when we win.

28:05.988 --> 28:09.078
They won't want to be released,

28:09.122 --> 28:11.820
and I...

28:13.039 --> 28:15.998
I might not want
to release them.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.702
Mm. Maybe this was a mistake.

28:26.182 --> 28:29.969
All right, somewhere
underneath this...

28:30.012 --> 28:32.841
...absurd spectacle
I see before me,

28:32.885 --> 28:36.366
are five broken pieces
of Captain Rios.

28:36.410 --> 28:39.369
It's like you each
got dealt a hole card.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.243
How about you
turn them over, hmm?

28:46.072 --> 28:47.377
Sit up.

28:50.076 --> 28:53.035
Oh-- L-Let's start
with the girl. Um,

28:53.079 --> 28:56.560
Ian, you called her "Jana."
You said you recognized her.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.867
I did. I do.
I do, too.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.608
Yes. Jana.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.349
Poor thing. It was just...

29:02.392 --> 29:03.916
so tragic.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.221
I...

29:07.049 --> 29:09.269
No. Sorry.

29:09.312 --> 29:11.662
It's like my knowledge of
Medusan astrogation techniques,

29:11.706 --> 29:13.447
totally gone.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.754
It's something to do with
his time on the ibn Majid,

29:15.797 --> 29:16.842
with his captain.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.845
Aye, Captain Alonzo Vandermeer.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.848
Well, what about him?
Were they close?

29:22.891 --> 29:24.719
Is he alive?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.242
It's, um...

29:26.286 --> 29:28.201
Ah...

29:28.244 --> 29:30.899
The information's there,
somewhere. I can feel it..

29:33.293 --> 29:35.730
...but I can't quite get at it.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.471
Emmet.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.824
What?

29:42.868 --> 29:45.784
RAFFI:
Ugh.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.047
What happened to Vandermeer?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.402
Oh. Well, that's awful.

29:55.445 --> 29:56.795
Do we know why?

29:56.838 --> 30:00.059
It's one of those things ye ken,
but ye dinna say.

30:01.974 --> 30:05.891
Turns out
we don't actually "ken."

30:07.283 --> 30:11.244
I can feel the answer,
or a ghost of it.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.855
This may violate
my Hippocratic coding,

30:13.899 --> 30:16.162
but after the whole thing
was over,

30:16.205 --> 30:18.860
Captain Rios suffered
some kind of breakdown.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.253
Oy, oy, oy.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.255
That's why he was discharged.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.823
Um, "whole thing"?
What "whole thing"?

30:26.259 --> 30:28.783
Something happened
on the ibn Majid,

30:28.827 --> 30:31.133
something that had to do
with Vandermeer

30:31.177 --> 30:33.962
and a girl named Jana.

30:34.006 --> 30:35.268
Don't bother searching
for ship's logs

30:35.311 --> 30:36.922
or personnel records
on the ibn Majid.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.053
Why?It was all classified.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.055
RAFFI:
Because?

30:41.709 --> 30:43.624
RAFFI:
Oh, oh. come on.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.018
One of you knows.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.368
What happened on the ibn Majid?

30:48.411 --> 30:51.110
One of us knows.

30:51.153 --> 30:54.461
And he's sae fou as a piper
an' awfu aff the fang.

30:55.679 --> 30:56.637
So true, Ian.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.161
I mean...

30:59.205 --> 31:01.903
It's not even the language.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.958
Did it work?

31:13.001 --> 31:17.136
You neutralized the viridium,
if that's what you mean.

31:17.179 --> 31:21.401
We're no longer being tracked
by the Tal Shiar.

31:21.444 --> 31:24.883
We are now headed
for Deep Space 12.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.320
When we arrive,
you will surrender yourself

31:27.363 --> 31:30.889
to the authorities
for the murder of Bruce Maddox.

31:39.158 --> 31:43.075
I've been trying
to work it out...

31:43.118 --> 31:46.600
how you could have done
such a thing.

31:46.643 --> 31:49.777
He was your mentor,

31:49.820 --> 31:53.346
your... lover.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.181
Why?

32:05.706 --> 32:07.534
I had to.

32:07.577 --> 32:11.668
When Commodore Oh came
to find me that day, she...

32:14.149 --> 32:16.673
...she did something
to me.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.762
Poisoned me.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.200
So the head of
Starfleet Security

32:21.243 --> 32:24.333
had you ingest
a viridium tracker?

32:24.377 --> 32:29.208
Yes, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.429
She put poison in my mind,

32:33.473 --> 32:35.954
Picard. She...

32:35.997 --> 32:40.480
put her hands on my head
and poured in...

32:45.964 --> 32:49.445
She put in a psychic block to
keep me from talking about it.

32:49.489 --> 32:53.188
Ah, you must fight...I don't want to talk about it!

32:56.800 --> 32:58.977
Do you believe in hell?

33:00.543 --> 33:03.155
Yeah, neither did I,

33:03.198 --> 33:05.418
until I saw it.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.637
Now?

33:07.681 --> 33:11.380
I think about suicide every day.

33:11.424 --> 33:14.818
That's how I comfort myself.

33:14.862 --> 33:18.518
Was this experience,

33:18.561 --> 33:23.218
this vision of Oh's,

33:23.262 --> 33:26.047
one that she lived
through herself?

33:26.091 --> 33:28.093
No, no.

33:28.136 --> 33:32.271
It happened...

33:32.314 --> 33:35.926
thousands
of centuries ago

33:35.970 --> 33:39.191
because of hubris.
Hubris like Bruce's.

33:39.234 --> 33:42.237
Because of synthetic life?

33:42.281 --> 33:45.414
We're at a threshold.

33:45.458 --> 33:49.027
I saw it, Picard.
Oh showed me.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.767
Unless we act quickly

33:50.811 --> 33:54.293
and destroy even the possibility
of synthetic life...

33:54.336 --> 33:58.036
Hell will come again.

33:59.602 --> 34:02.301
And this threshold...

34:02.344 --> 34:07.045
Is the coming of Seb Cheneb.
The Destroyer.

34:11.527 --> 34:12.702
Me.

34:16.097 --> 34:18.839
♪ In my

34:18.882 --> 34:22.190
♪ Solitude

34:24.888 --> 34:29.371
♪ You haunt me

34:33.245 --> 34:38.380
♪ With reveries

34:38.424 --> 34:44.517
♪ Of days gone by

34:46.910 --> 34:52.438
♪ In my solitude

34:53.961 --> 34:58.052
♪ You taunt me...

34:58.096 --> 35:00.446
So...

35:00.489 --> 35:05.407
Captain
Alonzo Vandermeer.

35:06.234 --> 35:08.410
Uh, that his...

35:08.454 --> 35:10.238
Walkman?

35:10.282 --> 35:13.372
♪ Never die

35:13.415 --> 35:16.070
I used to pretend
he was my father.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.637
Mm.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.161
Called him "Pops"
in my head.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.424
Couple of times,
it almost slipped out.

35:22.468 --> 35:23.643
Mm.

35:23.686 --> 35:25.906
Kind of a surprise
when he turned out to be

35:25.949 --> 35:27.690
a cold-blooded murderer.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.736
Who...

35:29.779 --> 35:32.130
who did he murder?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.133
JURATI:
Do you sleep?

35:36.003 --> 35:38.614
Every night.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.574
You sleep every night.

35:41.617 --> 35:44.577
My God.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.274
Do you eat?

35:46.318 --> 35:48.842
When I'm hungry.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.019
What do you do when you're sad?

35:52.062 --> 35:54.239
Cry.

35:54.282 --> 35:55.762
Thirsty?

35:55.805 --> 35:57.546
Drink.

35:57.590 --> 36:01.159
You drink
when you're thirsty.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.120
That is so beautiful.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.383
RIOS:
We were way the hell out

36:08.427 --> 36:10.255
in the Vayt Sector.

36:10.298 --> 36:11.952
Picked up a
diplomatic mission.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.083
Out of nowhere,

36:13.127 --> 36:14.737
tiny ship,

36:14.781 --> 36:16.391
unknown design.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.263
Two passengers.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.439
We scanned them.
They checked out.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.267
We sent the info
to Starfleet

36:22.310 --> 36:25.574
and notified them
of a first contact.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.620
Then we beamed them on board.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.274
The ambassador,

36:29.317 --> 36:31.450
Beautiful Flower,

36:31.493 --> 36:35.628
and his young protégé.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.717
Jana.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.371
JURATI:
You have a constellation

36:39.414 --> 36:43.157
of three beauty marks
on your right cheek.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.899
Which is a good thing?

36:45.942 --> 36:47.683
Which is artistry.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.904
Noonien Soong, who made Data,
thought of himself as an artist.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.471
But...

36:52.514 --> 36:55.082
he never gave Data
three beauty marks.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.738
I also have a mole on my chest.

36:58.781 --> 37:01.219
And a crooked pinky toe.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.829
You are a wonder.

37:02.872 --> 37:07.355
A... technological masterpiece
and work of art.

37:07.399 --> 37:08.922
Am I a person?

37:08.965 --> 37:11.707
RIOS:
We shake hands.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.232
We sit down,
have a bite to eat.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.581
A few hours later,

37:15.624 --> 37:17.974
Alonzo Vandermeer kills
them both in cold blood.

37:18.018 --> 37:22.196
He takes them both out with
two quick pops of a phaser.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.763
Why?

37:23.806 --> 37:26.331
Am I a person?

37:27.157 --> 37:29.247
Not in theory.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.552
To you.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.337
Right now.
Looking at me.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.860
Talking to me.

37:35.731 --> 37:40.258
Do you consider me to
be a person like you?

37:40.301 --> 37:41.737
It was a black flag directive,

37:41.781 --> 37:44.044
straight from
Starfleet Security.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.307
He told me they said

37:46.351 --> 37:47.874
if he disobeyed,

37:47.917 --> 37:50.224
the ibn Majid
would be destroyed

37:50.268 --> 37:51.356
with all hands.What?

37:51.399 --> 37:53.662
I went at him hard.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.925
Pretty hard.

38:03.411 --> 38:05.326
That's when he put
the phaser in his mouth

38:05.370 --> 38:06.806
and pulled the trigger.

38:07.850 --> 38:11.027
Oh, Chris.

38:11.071 --> 38:14.944
Raffi, then-then
I covered it up.

38:16.729 --> 38:19.601
Like he was supposed to do.

38:21.211 --> 38:23.301
So it wouldn't
all be for nothing.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.477
So they wouldn't
blow up the ibn Majid

38:25.520 --> 38:27.566
and everyone on it.

38:27.609 --> 38:28.915
I beamed the bodies into space.

38:28.958 --> 38:32.310
Deleted it from
the transporter log.

38:33.398 --> 38:34.964
Let the whole fleet know

38:35.008 --> 38:37.315
that Alonzo Vandermeer
had killed himself

38:37.358 --> 38:39.360
for no fucking reason at all.

38:45.497 --> 38:49.109
Six months later,
I was out of Starfleet.

38:49.152 --> 38:51.720
They called it, uh,

38:51.764 --> 38:55.289
post-traumatic dysphoria.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.986
But I was just...

38:57.030 --> 38:58.597
Broken.

39:02.122 --> 39:05.081
I'm so sorry, babe.

39:06.909 --> 39:10.783
When that girl
beamed aboard today,

39:10.826 --> 39:13.176
I mean, Raffi...

39:13.220 --> 39:15.962
it's the same girl.

39:16.005 --> 39:19.531
The other one sketched it
while we were talking.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.316
They were synths.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.187
That's why
they had to die.

39:25.232 --> 39:28.191
Chris,

39:28.235 --> 39:30.237
who gave the order?

39:30.280 --> 39:32.065
SOJI:
Commodore Oh

39:32.108 --> 39:34.502
ordered you to kill me, too.

39:38.245 --> 39:41.466
I would never give you
the opportunity.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.946
Now that I've met you,

39:43.990 --> 39:45.818
I would never take it.

39:45.861 --> 39:49.822
Never, ever again.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.566
Okay?

40:17.153 --> 40:18.938
I'm afraid I broke your gun.

40:18.981 --> 40:22.463
Someone get me
another weapon.

40:22.507 --> 40:25.727
The lights are going out.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.036
Are those
Borg life signs?

40:41.221 --> 40:43.179
Do they frighten you?

40:43.223 --> 40:45.443
I'd be a fool
if they didn't.

40:46.574 --> 40:51.144
Something far worse
is coming, Centurion,

40:51.187 --> 40:54.190
if I fail in my work.

41:16.865 --> 41:19.868
We are Borg.

41:19.912 --> 41:22.131
We are Borg. We are Borg.

41:25.134 --> 41:26.484
Now.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.838
No!

42:05.914 --> 42:08.526
Well...

42:08.569 --> 42:10.919
I'm done murdering people.

42:12.573 --> 42:15.576
So that's a good thing.

42:18.100 --> 42:22.017
When we get to Deep Space 12,
I'm gonna turn myself in.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.849
Are you all right?

42:41.515 --> 42:44.300
I-I'm sorry.

42:44.344 --> 42:47.390
You all are the closest
I've come in a long...

42:47.434 --> 42:53.222
time, maybe ever,
to having a-a...

42:55.224 --> 42:56.835
...crew.

42:56.878 --> 43:01.187
S... Sorry I had
to fucking ruin it.

43:06.932 --> 43:09.195
Sh-Should we get into it?

43:19.553 --> 43:21.816
I'm sorry, too.

43:21.860 --> 43:24.645
Peppermint,
French fries.

43:24.689 --> 43:26.734
To me it looks kind
of disgusting, but...

43:27.605 --> 43:28.823
...you love it, right?

43:28.867 --> 43:30.999
How did you know?

43:32.610 --> 43:33.915
Oh, we'll get there, honey.

43:35.308 --> 43:37.440
Now listen.

43:37.484 --> 43:40.574
Two, three hundred thousand
years ago,

43:40.618 --> 43:44.665
somebody drags
eight suns together.

43:44.709 --> 43:47.712
They hang a planet
in the middle.

43:47.755 --> 43:51.063
And on this planet,
they place a warning.

43:51.106 --> 43:54.719
The Romulans call it
the Admonition.

43:54.762 --> 43:56.721
RAFFI:
This warning says,

43:56.764 --> 43:59.245
"Don't do what we did.

43:59.288 --> 44:02.465
We created
synthetic life-forms, and..."

44:02.509 --> 44:03.771
And they evolved.

44:04.859 --> 44:08.341
And it did not go well. At all.

44:08.384 --> 44:10.299
Meaning?

44:10.343 --> 44:13.607
Apparently, these people
believed there was a threshold

44:13.651 --> 44:17.176
of synthetic evolution,
a dividing line.

44:17.219 --> 44:18.220
RIOS:
Like

44:18.264 --> 44:19.613
with Zefram Cochrane
and warp drive,

44:19.657 --> 44:22.485
When you cross
that line,

44:22.529 --> 44:23.878
somebody shows up?

44:23.922 --> 44:26.098
Somebody really bad.

44:26.141 --> 44:27.926
PICARD:
The Romulans, it seems,

44:27.969 --> 44:30.668
took this Admonition
very seriously.

44:30.711 --> 44:33.801
They created a group,

44:33.845 --> 44:37.283
the Zhat Vash,

44:37.326 --> 44:39.198
dedicated to finding

44:39.241 --> 44:43.071
and terminating
all synthetic life.

44:43.115 --> 44:47.336
RAFFI:
So imagine, 30,
40 years ago,

44:47.380 --> 44:50.513
Dr. Noonien Soong starts
turning out synthetic life

44:50.557 --> 44:52.733
that's equal to human beings.

44:52.777 --> 44:55.040
Superior, in some ways.

44:55.083 --> 45:00.306
The Romulans send in a
mole, a half-Romulan

45:00.349 --> 45:03.831
Vulcan named Oh.

45:05.398 --> 45:07.182
She burrows
into Starfleet,

45:07.226 --> 45:10.838
rises through the ranks
and becomes head of Security.

45:11.970 --> 45:14.973
And all the while,
she has one mandate:

45:15.016 --> 45:17.323
to put a stop
to the Federation's research

45:17.366 --> 45:19.586
and development
of synthetic life-forms.

45:19.629 --> 45:23.242
To this end,
she decides

45:23.285 --> 45:27.942
to engineer a situation
so terrifying

45:27.986 --> 45:30.466
that the Federation's
only response

45:30.510 --> 45:34.819
will be to ban synths forever.

45:34.862 --> 45:37.430
The Romulans were behind
the attack on Mars.

45:37.473 --> 45:39.171
Yeah.

45:39.214 --> 45:43.523
It has a certain ring to it,
am I right?

45:43.566 --> 45:45.307
Carry on.

45:45.351 --> 45:49.181
RAFFI:
But the commodore's
work wasn't done.

45:49.224 --> 45:52.401
Nine years ago, a Starfleet
vessel had first contact

45:52.445 --> 45:53.838
with a pair of emissaries

45:53.881 --> 45:56.188
from a strange
new world.

45:56.231 --> 45:58.407
One called himself
Beautiful Flower.

45:59.452 --> 46:00.758
The other one was...

46:00.801 --> 46:02.324
Jana.

46:05.545 --> 46:07.025
How do I know that?

46:07.068 --> 46:08.766
The same way I know
you like to dip French fries

46:08.809 --> 46:10.332
in peppermint ice cream.

46:11.812 --> 46:14.206
RAFFI:
Jana and this Flower

46:14.249 --> 46:17.296
came from the world
that Bruce Maddox fled to

46:17.339 --> 46:19.733
when he left Earth
after the ban,

46:19.777 --> 46:23.955
bound and determined
to carry out his work.

46:23.998 --> 46:27.523
And the Zhat Vash have been
searching for this world

46:27.567 --> 46:28.873
ever since.

46:28.916 --> 46:31.397
Which they have now found
because of me.

46:40.319 --> 46:42.974
Excuse me.

46:52.766 --> 46:55.769
Soji, what are you doing?

46:55.813 --> 46:57.553
Emmet, ayuda.

46:58.641 --> 46:59.817
Emmet!

46:59.860 --> 47:01.993
SOJI:
I deactivated them.
Don't worry,

47:02.036 --> 47:03.603
I'm not going to hurt anybody,
I just need to get back home.

47:03.646 --> 47:06.475
You'll get your ship back,
Rios, the minute we're there.

47:06.519 --> 47:08.260
Kid, I understand why you're
doing this, but it's not right.

47:08.303 --> 47:09.739
We want to help you.
You cannot just...

47:09.783 --> 47:11.306
How could you possibly
understand?

47:11.350 --> 47:12.742
Is someone trying
to wipe out

47:12.786 --> 47:14.092
your family?

47:14.135 --> 47:15.658
Do you even have a family?

47:15.702 --> 47:17.573
I do not.

47:17.617 --> 47:18.574
RAFFI:
What...

47:18.618 --> 47:20.185
W-What is that?

47:20.228 --> 47:22.752
Is that some kind of
subspace tunneling?

47:22.796 --> 47:25.190
It's a map of the Borg
transwarp conduit network.

47:25.233 --> 47:27.322
At this speed, we're about nine
hours from the nearest node.

47:27.366 --> 47:30.630
I don't actually know
how I know that. I...

47:30.673 --> 47:32.675
I must have picked it up
on the cube while I was busy

47:32.719 --> 47:34.895
being Dr. Soji Asha.

47:34.939 --> 47:36.941
The second I heard
the truth about the ban,

47:36.984 --> 47:38.856
the Admonition and what happened

47:38.899 --> 47:40.335
to my brother and sister
on the ibn Majid,

47:40.379 --> 47:42.511
I suddenly seem to know
a whole lot of things.

47:44.296 --> 47:45.775
Do you know this?

47:45.819 --> 47:48.648
♪ Arroz con leche
se quiere casar♪

47:48.691 --> 47:51.390
♪ Con una viudita
de la capital♪

47:51.433 --> 47:54.132
♪ Que sepa tejer,
que sepa bordar♪

47:54.175 --> 47:57.178
♪ Que ponga la aguja
en su campanal.♪

47:58.919 --> 48:01.487
It's a lullaby my mother
used to sing to me.

48:01.530 --> 48:04.882
She didn't like other people
playing with her things, either.

48:06.579 --> 48:09.974
She's done it Maddox's way,
she's done it my way.

48:10.017 --> 48:12.324
Let's try doing it her way.

48:12.367 --> 48:16.154
And hope we get there
in time to warn them.

48:27.556 --> 48:30.211
Actually...

48:30.255 --> 48:32.387
I-I don't know how to work this.

48:33.606 --> 48:35.564
So, your plan is just,

48:35.608 --> 48:37.871
fly into a transwarp conduit,

48:37.915 --> 48:39.873
don't set up
a structural integrity field,

48:39.917 --> 48:41.266
no chroniton field?

48:41.309 --> 48:45.226
Just jump right in,
gravimetric shear be damned?

48:47.620 --> 48:50.579
Sirenais my goddamn ship,
hija.

48:53.887 --> 48:58.239
Captain Rios,
please take me home.

49:00.589 --> 49:02.591
For Jana's sake.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.616
I got you.

49:33.753 --> 49:36.277
TARENT:
The fleet has the coordinates
for the synthetic home world.

49:36.321 --> 49:37.887
They're leaving now.

49:37.931 --> 49:39.585
NARISSA:
Have all the Borg
been jettisoned?

49:39.628 --> 49:42.196
Yes, Colonel. In an hour
we'll have the xBs mopped up

49:42.240 --> 49:43.371
and be ready to embark...

49:43.415 --> 49:45.634
And my ship is
ready for departure?

49:47.723 --> 49:49.290
Qezh.

50:20.887 --> 50:23.629
They are gone.

50:23.672 --> 50:27.415
It is over.
The cube is ours again.

50:27.459 --> 50:29.983
So...

50:30.027 --> 50:33.204
are you gonna
assimilate me now?

50:34.640 --> 50:38.296
: Annika
still has work to do.

50:53.615 --> 50:58.142
PICARD:
You know, I remember
standing the night watch

50:58.185 --> 51:00.927
as a young ensign on
the bridge of the Reliant.

51:00.970 --> 51:05.888
Feeling...
I was the only one awake

51:05.932 --> 51:09.718
in all that... emptiness,

51:09.762 --> 51:12.417
all that silence.

51:13.635 --> 51:15.550
I'd forgotten

51:15.594 --> 51:17.596
until...

51:17.639 --> 51:20.164
just now

51:20.207 --> 51:23.080
how much I loved it.

51:25.038 --> 51:27.867
I knew Alonzo
Vandermeer slightly.

51:27.910 --> 51:33.046
He was first officer to an
Academy classmate of mine.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.570
Captain Marta Batanides.

51:35.614 --> 51:37.094
You knew her?

51:37.137 --> 51:40.053
No, but... I felt like I did.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.186
She was a legend to the old man.

51:42.229 --> 51:44.188
My old man...

51:44.231 --> 51:47.365
Captain Vandermeer.

51:47.408 --> 51:49.802
Hmm.

51:57.418 --> 51:59.594
Did he know

51:59.638 --> 52:01.292
they were synthetic?

52:01.335 --> 52:03.903
I have to believe
that he did.

52:03.946 --> 52:06.210
He must have
thought that,

52:06.253 --> 52:08.212
because of that,

52:08.255 --> 52:10.388
he'd be able
to live with it.

52:10.431 --> 52:15.436
I didn't know him well,
as I said, but...

52:15.480 --> 52:17.438
I felt he was a good man.

52:17.482 --> 52:20.876
One of the best
that Starfleet had to offer.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.878
He was.

52:22.922 --> 52:25.185
I, um...

52:25.229 --> 52:26.795
I hate that he
died thinking

52:26.839 --> 52:29.233
it was really Starfleet
that betrayed him.

52:29.276 --> 52:31.104
Betrayed itself.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.237
But Starfleet didbetray him.

52:33.280 --> 52:36.370
We didbetray ourselves.

52:36.414 --> 52:40.940
Long before
Oh gave Vandermeer that order.

52:40.983 --> 52:44.117
The ban itself was a betrayal.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.468
Oh, the Zhat Vash--
they set the trap,

52:47.512 --> 52:50.210
but we could merely
have sidestepped it.

52:50.254 --> 52:52.821
Instead, we gave way to fear.

52:54.562 --> 52:57.957
It took her all of five minutes
to hack my ship, Picard.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.396
And now, maybe there's
a whole planet of them.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.443
Raffi said the Romulans
call her "the Destroyer."

53:06.879 --> 53:08.620
What if they're right?

53:08.663 --> 53:11.362
They may be right
about what happened

53:11.405 --> 53:13.799
200,000 years ago.

53:13.842 --> 53:15.496
The past is written.

53:15.540 --> 53:18.717
But the future is left
for us to write,

53:18.760 --> 53:21.241
and we have
powerful tools, Rios:

53:21.285 --> 53:24.070
openness, optimism

53:24.113 --> 53:27.552
and the spirit of curiosity.

53:27.595 --> 53:30.642
All they have is
secrecy and fear,

53:30.685 --> 53:34.559
and fear is the great destroyer,
Rios, not...

53:35.603 --> 53:37.301
We're there.
