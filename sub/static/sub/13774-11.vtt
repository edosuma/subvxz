00:01.383 --> 00:03.693
I want to talk to you
about what my law firm does.

00:03.812 --> 00:06.801
Look, has my firm
represented a few bad apples?

00:07.051 --> 00:07.879
Maybe.

00:07.999 --> 00:11.432
Was it a mistake for us to take
on that Japanese whalers' case?

00:11.839 --> 00:12.713
Possibly.

00:12.833 --> 00:13.693
Possibly?

00:13.813 --> 00:16.193
Definitely, but I think you'll
find that

00:16.261 --> 00:18.667
if your company retains my firm,

00:18.961 --> 00:21.006
that we are just a family.

00:21.418 --> 00:23.169
Just a small family,

00:23.289 --> 00:24.779
of corporate litigators.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.038
Oh, here we are, hey little man?
There's the big guy.

00:27.158 --> 00:30.062
He's a still a little cranky.

00:30.182 --> 00:32.743
Well, let's get the big guy something
to eat, they've got a kids menu here.

00:33.037 --> 00:35.095
What he likes is not on the menu.

00:35.215 --> 00:36.592
Here we go, baby.

00:36.712 --> 00:39.095
- Um...
- Just go ahead.

00:39.215 --> 00:41.983
This is what you love, 
go ahead, latch on.

00:42.103 --> 00:43.842
- This is a little hard.
- How old is he?

00:43.962 --> 00:46.386
He's like a year old.

00:46.708 --> 00:47.912
He's 19 months.

00:48.032 --> 00:50.544
Everybody eat, eat.
He can't be the only one.

00:51.959 --> 00:56.089
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:57.317 --> 00:59.224
I can't believe that my son is
still breast-feeding.

00:59.344 --> 01:01.829
I can barely get latched
on to those tits.

01:01.949 --> 01:03.616
What's she gonna do?
Is she gonna be at little league

01:03.736 --> 01:06.655
and she's gonna have to be in the dugout,
squirt it out if he needs a little taste?

01:06.775 --> 01:09.650
If you're old enough to ask for it,
then you're too old to receive it.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.869
I'm just worried that
he's gonna end up weird.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.845
Not like serial killer weird but like

01:14.965 --> 01:17.744
"fat, ambisexual church receptionist" weird.

01:17.864 --> 01:20.789
Or even worse, "guy who brings
his own smelly snacks to a bar" weird.

01:20.909 --> 01:23.030
Oh, this is actually
Grandma Sally's soy snacks.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.353
They're reducing my body fat,
fighting against cancer.

01:25.473 --> 01:26.291
Just from eating soy?

01:26.411 --> 01:28.336
I'm on a pure soy diet almost.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.085
Want some?

01:30.153 --> 01:33.033
Oh, that thing smells like Birkenstocks
that have been left out at Bonnaroo.

01:33.153 --> 01:35.624
"He liked
pussy soy snacks."

01:35.706 --> 01:36.759
Taco, what are you,
what are you doing?

01:36.827 --> 01:38.528
Yeah, Jimmy Olsen, what
are you writing down?

01:41.704 --> 01:42.632
Obituaries for you guys.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.264
Your hobby is imagining what
you're going to write when we die?

01:46.384 --> 01:47.300
You guys don't do this?

01:47.504 --> 01:48.196
No.

01:48.263 --> 01:49.303
Well, these aren't final.

01:49.423 --> 01:50.588
Obviously... I'm right here.

01:50.708 --> 01:52.800
Yeah, but, I mean, you've pretty
much done what you're going to do.

01:52.868 --> 01:53.634
Yeah, you're over.

01:53.702 --> 01:54.468
Here we go.

01:54.536 --> 01:57.405
"Kevin McArthur died in 2014."

01:57.472 --> 01:58.472
Well, that's good to know.

01:58.540 --> 02:00.076
"Outlived his wife by three years.

02:00.196 --> 02:03.959
He leaves behind a daughter and
a loving brother who saved the world

02:04.079 --> 02:05.680
from terrorism."

02:05.747 --> 02:06.976
Whoa, congratulations to you.

02:07.096 --> 02:08.120
I got "Andre Nowzik..."

02:08.240 --> 02:09.009
Thank you very much.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.847
"...died in 2012 of a
swallowing accident."

02:13.267 --> 02:15.723
Oh, you didn't mention
anything about me being a

02:15.791 --> 02:16.656
doctor, changing people's lives?

02:16.776 --> 02:18.420
Well, I write the important stuff.

02:18.540 --> 02:19.302
What else?

02:19.422 --> 02:24.046
Oh, "Pete... no known last
name... died in 2071."

02:24.166 --> 02:25.099
Sweet.

02:25.167 --> 02:27.018
"He loved to watch TV."
That's all I have.

02:27.138 --> 02:28.481
- You nailed that one, bud.
- Right.

02:29.349 --> 02:30.504
Okay.

02:30.849 --> 02:32.440
What about Ruxin?

02:32.507 --> 02:33.441
I haven't done one for you.

02:33.508 --> 02:35.276
What do you mean you
haven't done one for me?

02:35.344 --> 02:36.813
'Cause you haven't really
accomplished anything yet.

02:36.933 --> 02:37.793
He's got you there.

02:37.913 --> 02:40.384
I got to say I'm pretty happy
with the number two slot.

02:44.089 --> 02:45.103
No, I'm not choking.

02:45.223 --> 02:46.041
Stop it.

02:46.882 --> 02:47.942
Damn it.

02:52.636 --> 02:54.327
And suck it, Andre.

02:54.395 --> 02:56.774
Thanks again for those
cookies, Maggie.

02:56.894 --> 02:57.866
Much appreciated.

02:58.291 --> 02:59.225
Bill.

02:59.292 --> 03:00.059
Pete, how are you?

03:00.127 --> 03:00.893
Doing great, man.

03:00.961 --> 03:01.727
How's the knee?

03:01.795 --> 03:02.561
Not too bad.

03:02.629 --> 03:05.254
Did you get to those Dukatech
numbers that I asked you about?

03:05.374 --> 03:08.034
Just, just pushing 'em through, so...
Yeah, I do need you to push 'em through.

03:08.101 --> 03:08.857
You said you would have 'em yesterday.

03:08.977 --> 03:11.545
Definite team effort we're feeling
in the homestretch there, so...

03:11.665 --> 03:12.764
Just to be clear, it's
not a team effort.

03:12.884 --> 03:14.023
I've only asked you to do it.

03:14.143 --> 03:15.367
This is a top priority.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.263
So we're on the same page?

03:16.383 --> 03:17.047
Crystal.

03:17.287 --> 03:18.954
Just talk to me like a person, okay?

03:19.022 --> 03:21.043
Train moving 100 miles an hour.
We are gunning for it.

03:21.163 --> 03:21.925
Just say yes.

03:22.045 --> 03:22.695
And I'm feeling good.

03:22.815 --> 03:23.970
Just say the word yes.

03:24.090 --> 03:24.936
You got it.

03:26.316 --> 03:28.276
After a little Fantasy...

03:28.396 --> 03:30.992
Welcome back to Sirius XM Fantasy Football

03:31.112 --> 03:33.009
along with Adam Caplan,
I'm John Hansen.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.940
Adam, let's go to the phones.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.436
K-Dog in Chicago.
Yo, what's up, K-Dog?

03:37.556 --> 03:39.593
Hey, guys, first-time, long- time.

03:39.713 --> 03:41.913
Ho-ho!

03:41.981 --> 03:44.249
All righty, what do
you got there, K-Dog?

03:44.317 --> 03:46.985
Look, I'm having a number two
wide receiver issue this week.

03:47.053 --> 03:49.488
I don't know whether to start
Meachem against the Cowboys,

03:49.555 --> 03:52.591
and then again I always have Mike
Wallace going up against the Bills.

03:52.658 --> 03:54.493
I mean, it's a toss-up, guys.
What do you think?

03:54.560 --> 03:56.495
The one thing I like about
Wallace is he's a deep threat

03:56.562 --> 03:58.530
and you know he's got a
chance to score at any time.

03:58.598 --> 04:03.268
The problem with Meachem is Sean
Payton is evil for fantasy football.

04:03.336 --> 04:05.871
He has a new favorite
receiver every week.

04:05.938 --> 04:07.105
You can't trust Meachem.

04:07.173 --> 04:09.174
All right, bu-but which one
would you rank higher?

04:09.242 --> 04:10.876
Both guys have upside potential, Adam.

04:10.943 --> 04:12.778
But Wallace has got the best matchups.

04:12.845 --> 04:14.352
So Wallace it is.

04:14.472 --> 04:16.613
This week Mike Wallace is higher.

04:16.733 --> 04:17.846
So I'm gonna start Wallace, then?

04:17.966 --> 04:18.911
We would say yes.

04:19.283 --> 04:21.144
So you're leaning towards Wallace?

04:21.273 --> 04:22.206
Yes!

04:22.234 --> 04:23.753
Wallace... lock it in, done.

04:23.799 --> 04:26.578
An-And please, if you're ever out
in Chicago, I'd love to take

04:26.645 --> 04:29.514
you out for dinner or a drink or...
We like Chicago.

04:29.582 --> 04:30.956
Not so sure about you, bro.

04:31.076 --> 04:32.884
Hello, hello?

04:32.952 --> 04:34.252
Okay, they're gone.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.789
All right, anyway, Wallace it is.

04:37.856 --> 04:38.502
Lock it in.

04:40.181 --> 04:42.126
Listen, I'm just going to
cut right to the chase.

04:42.194 --> 04:45.563
It's clear to us that you have
been working on not work but on

04:45.631 --> 04:48.299
fantasy football as well as
some out-there porn sites.

04:48.367 --> 04:49.200
That is not me.

04:49.268 --> 04:50.068
I'm a company man.

04:50.135 --> 04:51.202
You know how it is, Bill.

04:51.270 --> 04:54.149
This is a printout of your
activity from this morning.

04:55.374 --> 04:56.808
FantasyGuru.

04:56.875 --> 04:57.976
Rotowire.

04:58.043 --> 05:01.379
There's something in here
called FootAndBalls.net.

05:01.447 --> 05:02.662
Now, that could go either way.

05:02.782 --> 05:07.856
Point is you're busted, but
don't worry, I play, too.

05:07.976 --> 05:08.753
You do?

05:08.775 --> 05:11.221
Yeah, I got a league with some of the
other VPs, but the thing is that I suck.

05:11.329 --> 05:12.901
- Here's the situation.
- Uh-huh.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.531
You are going to play for me.

05:14.599 --> 05:17.835
I want my team to win the next two games
because I need to get in the playoffs.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.934
I will not be made fun of
by these guys anymore.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.203
Bill, is this my new job?

05:21.323 --> 05:23.051
No, this is how you keep your old job.

05:23.171 --> 05:25.208
Tell you what... let's just
start with the basics.

05:25.328 --> 05:26.398
What's the team name?

05:26.518 --> 05:27.452
Wreaking Haddocks.

05:27.572 --> 05:30.714
It's like my name... Wreaking
Haddock... but with "wreak"...

05:30.782 --> 05:31.548
like "wreaking havoc."

05:31.616 --> 05:33.941
All right, that's your first problem
right there. What's the password?

05:34.061 --> 05:34.969
It's "King of Chardonnay."

05:35.089 --> 05:35.838
Want me to write it down?

05:35.958 --> 05:37.056
Jesus, Bill, no.

05:37.176 --> 05:37.742
I'll tell you what.

05:37.862 --> 05:41.201
What I'm hearing from you is
maybe just a little vacation time,

05:41.321 --> 05:42.615
maybe a little bonus.

05:42.735 --> 05:45.022
Here's what I's saying.
You get me in the playoffs,

05:45.274 --> 05:46.464
You get to keep your job.

05:46.584 --> 05:48.172
You don't get me in the playoffs,

05:48.292 --> 05:49.951
you leave
here and you never come back.

05:50.245 --> 05:51.253
With a bonus.

05:51.373 --> 05:52.490
Be honest with me.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.478
Do you have Asperger's?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.201
This is ridiculous.

05:56.321 --> 05:58.742
Meachem will not stop scoring points.

05:58.810 --> 05:59.610
So what's the problem?

05:59.677 --> 06:00.444
He's on your team.

06:00.511 --> 06:01.278
No, he's on my bench.

06:01.346 --> 06:02.112
That's the problem.

06:02.180 --> 06:03.113
Oh.

06:03.181 --> 06:05.215
I started Mike Wallace based
on what the fantasy "experts"

06:05.283 --> 06:07.005
told me was going to happen, and look.

06:07.055 --> 06:08.122
That's your problem.

06:08.190 --> 06:09.690
You take the rankings as gospel.

06:09.758 --> 06:10.691
You're a ranking slave.

06:10.759 --> 06:11.959
I'm not a ranking slave.

06:12.027 --> 06:14.161
You are, and it's not
just football, you guys.

06:14.229 --> 06:16.931
I mean, Kevin kind of does
this <i>with everything.</i>

06:16.998 --> 06:17.932
<i>I do not.</i>

06:17.999 --> 06:18.933
<i>Really?</i>

06:19.000 --> 06:20.501
<i>Neopolitano Ramona?</i>

06:20.569 --> 06:21.969
<i>Neopolitano Ramona.</i>

06:22.037 --> 06:22.970
<i>What, what is this?</i>

06:23.038 --> 06:26.907
<i>It's the number one-ranked cappuccino
maker in the entire world.</i>

06:26.975 --> 06:29.243
<i>How often do we
drink cappuccino?</i>

06:29.311 --> 06:30.244
<i>Rarely.</i>

06:30.312 --> 06:31.245
<i>Never.</i>

06:31.313 --> 06:34.782
<i>"He was a ranking slave
with a weak sex drive.</i>

06:34.850 --> 06:37.451
<i>His inability to trust his own
judgment is what killed him in</i>

06:37.519 --> 06:38.519
<i>the end.</i>

06:38.587 --> 06:41.989
<i>His number one-ranked GPS
led him off a cliff."</i>

06:42.057 --> 06:46.627
<i>"He is survived by his cappuccino
maker Neopolitano Ramona."</i>

06:46.695 --> 06:47.595
<i>You're a dick.</i>

06:47.662 --> 06:49.997
<i>Can we just talk about the
rankings that really matter?</i>

06:50.065 --> 06:52.933
<i>The Lady McArthurs won again,
and I am dangerously close to</i>

06:53.001 --> 06:53.968
<i>being relevant in this league.</i>

06:54.035 --> 06:56.170
<i>Much as I hate to say it,
you actually have a point.</i>

06:56.238 --> 06:59.006
<i>Next week's games decides who is
going to get the Sacko and who</i>

06:59.074 --> 06:59.940
<i>is going to get the Shiva.</i>

07:00.008 --> 07:01.775
<i>Pressure's on, kids, but at
least you only have one league</i>

07:01.843 --> 07:03.844
<i>to worry about.</i>

07:03.912 --> 07:05.394
- Did I tell you what's going on
with my boss? - No.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.968
<i>So my boss gives me his
shitty-ass team and says,</i>

07:09.088 --> 07:11.215
<i>"Get me in the playoffs or I'm
going to fire you."</i>

07:11.335 --> 07:12.865
<i>Does this have anything
to do with our league?</i>

07:12.974 --> 07:13.908
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:14.028 --> 07:15.310
<i>I don't know if I'm going
to be able to pull it off.</i>

07:15.431 --> 07:17.551
<i>The team is almost
as bad as Andre's.</i>

07:17.671 --> 07:19.393
- <i>Wow.</i>
- <i>I have a good team.</i>

07:19.426 --> 07:20.917
<i>I think we can go all the way.</i>

07:21.037 --> 07:22.511
<i>You know, two years in a row.</i>

07:22.763 --> 07:23.673
<i>Andre nation.</i>

07:23.793 --> 07:24.877
<i>Your team is awful.</i>

07:25.004 --> 07:25.612
<i>You're right.</i>

07:25.653 --> 07:26.771
<i>I'm falling apart.</i>

07:26.839 --> 07:29.407
<i>I'm playing you next week, and
you realize that I'm going</i>

07:29.475 --> 07:30.475
<i>to decimate your insides.</i>

07:30.543 --> 07:33.578
<i>Andre, can you at least assemble
some sort of shitty comeback?</i>

07:33.646 --> 07:34.445
<i>What's going on?</i>

07:34.513 --> 07:36.347
<i>Can you guys just give
me a second, please?</i>

07:36.415 --> 07:39.183
<i>I'm just a little
emotionally raw.</i>

07:39.251 --> 07:41.753
<i>You are riding a roller
coaster of emotion.</i>

07:41.820 --> 07:44.289
<i>I'm not riding a
roller coaster, okay?</i>

07:44.356 --> 07:48.148
<i>Is it perhaps something to do
with all the soy you've been eating?</i>

07:48.268 --> 07:49.427
<i>No, no.</i>

07:49.495 --> 07:52.130
<i>And the fact that soy has incredibly
high levels of estrogen?</i>

07:52.197 --> 07:53.031
<i>Andre, that's it.</i>

07:53.098 --> 07:54.699
<i>It's not it, okay?</i>

07:54.767 --> 07:57.201
<i>I don't know what it
is, but it's not it.</i>

07:57.269 --> 07:59.170
<i>What the hell is
wrong with you?</i>

07:59.238 --> 08:01.892
- <i>You have man-boobs.</i>
- What?

08:02.012 --> 08:04.762
- Look.
- Whoa!

08:04.882 --> 08:06.010
 <i>You've got fat nipples, son.</i>

08:06.078 --> 08:07.712
<i>Can you please just help
me here for a second?</i>

08:07.780 --> 08:09.447
<i>Yeah, you guys are
being a little harsh.</i>

08:09.515 --> 08:10.281
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:10.349 --> 08:11.783
<i>Answer me this, sweetheart.</i>

08:11.850 --> 08:14.385
<i>Do you go soft cup or underwire?</i>

08:14.453 --> 08:15.386
<i>I am going home.</i>

08:15.454 --> 08:16.387
<i>Aww.</i>

08:16.455 --> 08:18.056
<i>Have a great rest
of your Sunday.</i>

08:18.123 --> 08:19.057
<i>You wrecked mine.</i>

08:19.124 --> 08:22.160
<i>After his man-boobs came in,
his penis disappeared.</i>

08:22.227 --> 08:25.797
<i>2014, died of ovarian cancer.</i>

08:25.864 --> 08:26.864
<i>So sad.</i>

08:26.932 --> 08:27.899
<i>That is tragic.</i>

08:27.967 --> 08:28.733
<i>Done.</i>

08:28.801 --> 08:31.235
<i>Coming at you with Sirius
XM Fantasy Football.</i>

08:31.303 --> 08:32.837
<i>Let's go to Purple People Eater.</i>

08:32.905 --> 08:34.205
<i>Hey, what up?</i>

08:34.273 --> 08:36.073
<i>Purple People Eater
calling from Minnetonka.</i>

08:36.140 --> 08:37.708
<i>Want to talk Vikings football.</i>

08:37.775 --> 08:41.245
<i>Dude, we've taken a ton of
calls on the Vikings today.</i>

08:41.313 --> 08:43.815
<i>Purple, there are 31
other teams in the NFL.</i>

08:43.881 --> 08:46.651
<i>Yeah, it's not actually for me.</i>

08:46.719 --> 08:50.254
- <i>It's, um, for my wife who
recently</i>

08:50.322 --> 08:51.356
<i>passed away.</i>

08:51.423 --> 08:53.391
<i>Oy. Uh...
Was it sudden?</i>

08:53.459 --> 08:54.492
<i>What do you think, man?</i>

08:54.560 --> 08:55.493
<i>What do you think?</i>

08:55.561 --> 08:58.563
<i>Look, I agreed to manage her
fantasy football team and one of</i>

08:58.631 --> 09:01.599
<i>the things that she was
passionate about before her</i>

09:01.667 --> 09:05.870
<i>passing to the great beyond was
whether Percy Harvin's migraines</i>

09:05.938 --> 09:07.739
<i>were going to stop him
from starting this week.</i>

09:07.806 --> 09:09.941
<i>Adam, that is a tough situation
here, and we're also</i>

09:10.009 --> 09:11.376
<i>dealing with bereavement issues.</i>

09:11.443 --> 09:13.845
<i>Let's think about this, and
we'll get back to you on the</i>

09:13.912 --> 09:14.946
<i>other side, Purple People Eater.</i>

09:15.014 --> 09:16.300
<i>Thanks so much.</i>

09:16.420 --> 09:18.205
<i>Sweet.</i>

09:18.325 --> 09:19.983
<i>You had a first wife who died?</i>

09:20.103 --> 09:21.419
- <i>Huh?</i>
- <i>I'm your second wife?</i>

09:21.539 --> 09:22.098
<i>What?</i>

09:22.218 --> 09:23.344
<i>You didn't tell me that
you were married?</i>

09:23.464 --> 09:24.969
- <i>I can explain.</i>
- <i>Explain it, then.</i>

09:25.217 --> 09:26.043
<i>Welcome back.</i>

09:26.050 --> 09:26.491
<i>Okay.</i>

09:26.611 --> 09:27.704
<i>Widower, are you there?</i>

09:27.824 --> 09:28.638
<i>We're here for you.</i>

09:28.758 --> 09:30.019
<i>Widower going once.</i>

09:30.719 --> 09:31.929
<i>Widower going twice.</i>

09:31.997 --> 09:33.656
<i>Yeah, I'm a widower.</i>

09:33.776 --> 09:35.938
<i>So glad to have you back.</i>
<i>What can we do for you?</i>

09:36.058 --> 09:37.244
<i>I just got to take this.</i>

09:39.212 --> 09:40.245
Listen to me.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.980
We don't keep secrets from each other.

09:42.048 --> 09:42.814
Yeah.

09:43.385 --> 09:46.753
I mean, just this one secret about
my dead wife and that's it.

09:46.873 --> 09:48.671
I just...
I just want to know about her.

09:48.791 --> 09:49.567
Mm-hmm?

09:49.687 --> 09:51.763
- What was her name?
- Her name?

09:51.830 --> 09:53.064
How could you forget her name?

09:53.132 --> 09:53.898
How could I forget her name?

09:53.966 --> 09:54.732
You didn't know her.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.038
I did.
I was married to her.

09:56.158 --> 09:58.202
Her name.
Ramona? Ramona.

09:58.270 --> 09:59.637
Neopolitano.

09:59.705 --> 10:00.538
Ramona?

10:00.606 --> 10:01.372
Mm-hmm.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.240
Italian.

10:02.307 --> 10:03.241
Northern.

10:03.308 --> 10:05.109
I want to know a whole
lot more about her.

10:05.177 --> 10:09.983
Ooh, that's about all I can share
right now for all the...

10:11.771 --> 10:13.522
- Sty strong baby.
- Yeah.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.978
You know what would be really helpful?

10:16.098 --> 10:17.556
Sex and cookie dough and some sex.

10:19.992 --> 10:22.794
Hi. Excuse me.

10:22.861 --> 10:24.595
Hi.

10:24.663 --> 10:25.430
Thursday night, huh?

10:25.497 --> 10:27.098
Game's coming up.

10:27.166 --> 10:28.433
You a football fan?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.234
Mm-mm, no.

10:30.302 --> 10:31.963
Okay.

10:34.706 --> 10:36.574
- What was that?
- Oh, shit.

10:36.642 --> 10:37.775
Uh-oh.

10:37.843 --> 10:38.609
What?

10:38.677 --> 10:39.444
Oh, not good.

10:39.511 --> 10:40.278
Come on.

10:40.345 --> 10:41.145
There's no phone in here.

10:41.213 --> 10:41.979
No phone?

10:42.047 --> 10:42.980
Try your cell phone.

10:43.048 --> 10:43.915
I don't get service in here.

10:43.982 --> 10:45.316
No, I got nothing.

10:45.384 --> 10:47.018
Hello?

10:47.086 --> 10:48.286
Oh, shit.

10:48.353 --> 10:49.120
My line-up.

10:49.188 --> 10:49.987
It's after 6:00.

10:50.055 --> 10:50.922
The building is closed.

10:50.989 --> 10:51.756
What if there's a fire?

10:51.824 --> 10:53.458
Guys, we got to get out of here now.

10:53.525 --> 10:56.094
Well, how the heck are we
going to get out of here?

10:56.161 --> 10:57.662
Give me your shoulder.

10:57.729 --> 10:58.863
Here we go.

10:58.931 --> 11:01.999
Oh, my...

11:02.067 --> 11:03.835
Can I put my foot on
your head, please?

11:03.902 --> 11:04.669
Yeah.

11:04.736 --> 11:05.503
Yeah, yeah.

11:05.571 --> 11:06.504
Here we go.

11:06.572 --> 11:08.339
I just need a crowbar or something.

11:08.407 --> 11:09.173
What do you see?

11:09.241 --> 11:10.007
Oh, got it.

11:10.075 --> 11:10.842
You need a hand?

11:10.909 --> 11:11.676
Oh, my gosh.

11:11.743 --> 11:12.510
Here.

11:12.578 --> 11:13.344
Take this.

11:13.412 --> 11:14.178
There you go.

11:14.246 --> 11:15.012
Okay, I got it.

11:15.080 --> 11:15.980
I got it, I got it.

11:16.048 --> 11:16.981
Okay.

11:17.049 --> 11:17.815
Hand me this.

11:17.883 --> 11:21.686
Oh, my...
Stand back.

11:21.753 --> 11:23.821
Oh, my gosh.

11:23.889 --> 11:25.356
Yeah, it's moving, you guys.

11:25.424 --> 11:27.391
I got it.

11:27.459 --> 11:28.226
Keep going.

11:28.293 --> 11:29.293
Oh, my gosh.

11:29.361 --> 11:30.161
I'm going to crawl up.

11:30.229 --> 11:30.995
I'll pull you guys up.

11:31.063 --> 11:32.530
O-Okay.

11:32.598 --> 11:33.364
Come on, here we go.

11:33.432 --> 11:34.398
Genius.

11:34.466 --> 11:35.366
I got you.

11:35.434 --> 11:36.200
Thank you so much.

11:36.268 --> 11:37.068
All right, sir. Come on.

11:37.136 --> 11:38.336
Here we go, here we go.

11:38.403 --> 11:39.537
Do you work for the company?

11:39.571 --> 11:40.838
I mean, that was amazing.

11:40.906 --> 11:41.806
How can I ever thank you?

11:41.874 --> 11:43.474
No thanks necessary, seriously.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.143
You want to get some drinks sometime?

11:45.210 --> 11:46.010
I must be on my way, folks.

11:46.078 --> 11:46.844
I'm sorry.

11:46.912 --> 11:49.890
I-I...
Wait. We didn't get your name.

11:50.226 --> 11:52.074
Jeff, Jeff, I need your computer.

11:52.194 --> 11:53.460
Go go go go go.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.069
-What the hell?
- At little we have 30 seconds
to set you line-ups.

11:56.377 --> 11:58.729
Sorry, boss, Danny got to
get there himself.

11:58.849 --> 12:00.444
Alright. Get that out of there.
Uhh...

12:01.187 --> 12:03.021
Oh, shit, Johnson. Alright.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.892
Yeah. Oh, shit.

12:06.012 --> 12:07.887
Time is up, game just started.

12:08.314 --> 12:10.079
Alright Haddock.

12:10.199 --> 12:13.961
Where did we leave you last?

12:14.507 --> 12:16.650
Somewhere--illegal lineup?
What? No no, what--

12:17.055 --> 12:18.764
No quarterback, not good.
Alright.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.977
Back to the phone lines, we're gonna
go to K-dog in Chicago.

12:23.097 --> 12:24.798
- What's up K-dog?
- Do you remember me?

12:24.918 --> 12:26.866
I'm the guy you screwed over.

12:26.986 --> 12:28.559
You told me to start Wallas,

12:28.679 --> 12:30.310
meanwhile, I got Mitcham
sitting on the bench,

12:30.430 --> 12:31.629
he scores two touchdowns.

12:31.749 --> 12:33.400
It's one player. Come on, dude.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.926
I lost by three points.

12:34.993 --> 12:37.161
We told you Meachem
had upside potential.

12:37.229 --> 12:39.697
But you ranked Wallace higher.

12:39.765 --> 12:40.631
Rankings slave.

12:40.699 --> 12:41.699
Rankings bitch.

12:41.767 --> 12:42.867
That's exactly what I am.

12:42.935 --> 12:44.602
I'm a slave to the rankings.

12:44.670 --> 12:46.170
Dude, you got to be a man.

12:46.238 --> 12:47.305
Make your own decisions.

12:47.372 --> 12:48.306
Absolutely.

12:48.373 --> 12:51.976
I haven't made a decision for
myself since the day I got married.

12:52.044 --> 12:56.047
I have a car that has a little screen
that tells me what's behind me.

12:56.114 --> 12:58.382
I don't even want to make the
decision of turning my head to

12:58.450 --> 13:00.851
look what I'm running over.

13:00.919 --> 13:02.486
Tell me what to do!

13:02.554 --> 13:04.822
And Hansen, you even
call yourself a guru.

13:04.890 --> 13:05.790
You've "gurued" nothing!

13:05.857 --> 13:08.993
Don't call yourself an expert
and give me shitty advice.

13:09.061 --> 13:10.161
Hey, hey, hey.

13:10.229 --> 13:11.295
You suck at your job.

13:11.363 --> 13:14.031
Dude, here's a prediction
for you, my friend.

13:14.099 --> 13:16.801
You are banned from the show for life.

13:16.868 --> 13:18.336
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:18.403 --> 13:20.204
Because I'll call in as other people.

13:20.272 --> 13:23.074
I'm going to be Mike from
Seattle who's so upset Nate

13:23.141 --> 13:25.243
Burleson's not going
to make it this year.

13:25.310 --> 13:26.177
Correction, my friend.

13:26.245 --> 13:28.512
You're Kevin McArthur
from Winnetka, Illinois.

13:28.580 --> 13:30.414
And I'm looking at your phone
number right here, dude.

13:30.482 --> 13:31.415
It's not blocked?

13:32.317 --> 13:34.151
Can I take back what I just said?

13:34.219 --> 13:35.152
Eckhart.

13:35.220 --> 13:35.987
Hey, Bill.

13:36.054 --> 13:36.821
What's up?

13:36.888 --> 13:37.655
What the hell, man?

13:37.723 --> 13:38.656
What?

13:38.724 --> 13:40.324
You made me look like an idiot.

13:40.392 --> 13:41.192
You gave me an illegal lineup.

13:41.260 --> 13:43.027
No quarterback, one wide receiver.

13:43.095 --> 13:45.763
Thanks to you, the Wreaking Haddocks
are the laughingstock of my league.

13:45.831 --> 13:47.431
I told you to change the name.

13:47.499 --> 13:49.200
It has nothing to do
with the name, okay?

13:49.268 --> 13:50.034
It's an awesome name.

13:50.102 --> 13:52.203
It has to do with the fact that you
couldn't complete one simple

13:52.271 --> 13:54.372
little task and because
of that, you're fired.

13:54.439 --> 13:55.239
Wait. Wait.

13:55.307 --> 13:56.073
No. Really?

13:56.141 --> 13:58.109
I have been waiting for
this for such a long time.

13:58.176 --> 13:59.110
You can't be serious.

13:59.177 --> 14:00.344
Oh, I'm very serious.

14:00.412 --> 14:01.512
Haddock?

14:01.580 --> 14:02.680
Oh, Mr. Mitchell, sir.

14:02.748 --> 14:03.502
What did I just hear you say?

14:03.622 --> 14:06.498
- Sir, I was just letting him go for, uh...
- Letting him go?!

14:06.618 --> 14:08.470
He's a hero.

14:08.590 --> 14:10.337
He saved people from
a broken elevator.

14:10.457 --> 14:13.419
- Eckhart?
- Well, I wouldn't call myself a hero.

14:13.539 --> 14:14.959
He's a company man.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.580
Do you know what that means?

14:16.700 --> 14:19.066
Maybe I don't. I thought I did,
but I really...

14:19.186 --> 14:21.320
You know, we shouldn't be 
too hard at old Bill here.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.403
Actually, we were just 
discussing the future

14:23.523 --> 14:24.985
of my career here, and

14:25.018 --> 14:26.820
while it did sound like
it was going down,

14:26.940 --> 14:30.141
Bill was actually entertaining
the prospect of going...

14:31.445 --> 14:33.546
- Up.
- Good job.
- Alright.

14:33.930 --> 14:36.717
- Nice seeing you, Mr Mitchel.
- I believe we have a meeting.

14:36.837 --> 14:37.893
Ah, yes sir.

14:38.688 --> 14:40.144
You're a dick, you know that?

14:40.264 --> 14:41.433
God speed!

14:41.553 --> 14:43.029
Oh, king of chardonnay.

14:46.391 --> 14:47.077
Uh.

14:47.197 --> 14:47.959
Hello.

14:48.079 --> 14:49.460
Okay, so we're all on the same page here?

14:49.580 --> 14:50.930
Yeah, you're a monster.

14:51.050 --> 14:53.525
Sofia <i>needs to</i> believe
I have a dead wife.

14:53.645 --> 14:55.079
I've always had a dead wife.

14:55.199 --> 14:57.183
If Sofia finds out that
I don't have a dead wife,

14:57.303 --> 14:58.262
then I'm a dead husband.

14:58.382 --> 15:00.306
I plan on saying nothing

15:00.426 --> 15:01.799
and I'm confident it will
play out perfectly.

15:01.919 --> 15:05.370
- Great, this will play out.
- Oh, it's gonna play out...

15:05.877 --> 15:07.976
- What are you--
- ...perfectly. Let it play out.

15:10.217 --> 15:12.906
- It's really hot, I'm sweating balls.
- Jesus man, no, you're sweating tits,
look at those things.

15:13.026 --> 15:14.635
- Do you see them?
- They're tremendous.

15:14.755 --> 15:16.382
No, you can't, I'm wearing
compression shirt.

15:16.502 --> 15:19.743
Andre, stop eating the soy
and growing man breasts.

15:19.863 --> 15:21.532
- No more soy.
- Isn't it illegal

15:21.652 --> 15:24.093
for a plastic surgeon
to give himself a tit job?

15:24.213 --> 15:25.469
Why do you attack me like that?

15:25.589 --> 15:28.074
Andre, just write your feelings
down in your diary, that's all.

15:28.194 --> 15:31.020
I don't have a diary, I have
a dream journal.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.089
- Andre, why are you sweating?
- 'Cause I'm hot.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.095
This place is like a hot box.

15:35.215 --> 15:37.406
I mean, really, what are we in here?

15:37.526 --> 15:38.698
You're going through manopause.

15:38.766 --> 15:40.867
I'm not going through manopause, okay?

15:40.934 --> 15:43.629
No, no, you are, and the good news is,
you won't have manstruation anymore.

15:43.749 --> 15:44.717
Hi, guys.

15:44.837 --> 15:45.669
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:45.789 --> 15:48.077
I just want to say, thank
you for being here.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.410
Celebrating Ramona's life is
very special to me, so I think,

15:51.478 --> 15:53.713
um, we should take this
time to remember her.

15:53.781 --> 15:54.938
I would love to hear from you guys.

15:55.058 --> 15:58.117
Um...
Go ahead, talk about her.

15:58.185 --> 15:59.118
I'm a little... emotional.

15:59.186 --> 16:01.420
Yeah, what can you say about people?

16:01.540 --> 16:02.421
Yeah.

16:02.489 --> 16:03.623
It's like a kite in the wind.

16:03.690 --> 16:05.892
You know, it blows, and you lose it.

16:05.959 --> 16:06.759
Okay, please.

16:06.827 --> 16:07.960
I knew Ramona, okay?

16:08.028 --> 16:09.962
You know, and as we all knew,
she loved her Sundays.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.164
Mm.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.065
And she loved, more than
anything, her silence.

16:13.133 --> 16:16.736
Let's bow our heads and close our eyes,
focus on what's really important...

16:18.005 --> 16:20.106
If you... ...
still close ten.

16:20.174 --> 16:22.308
And a little middle
kind of bubble action.

16:22.376 --> 16:23.509
Diving touchdown.

16:23.577 --> 16:24.744
Oh!

16:25.813 --> 16:26.746
Let it out, guys.

16:26.814 --> 16:27.947
Let it all out.

16:28.015 --> 16:29.148
Aw!

16:29.216 --> 16:30.349
Mm. Feels good.

16:30.417 --> 16:31.584
That's good.

16:31.652 --> 16:33.452
I'm a little more emotional
than I thought I would be.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.453
Yeah, that was impressive.

16:34.521 --> 16:36.355
All right, well, um, can I get
you guys anything to drink?

16:36.423 --> 16:38.628
- A beer would be great. Thank you.
- Okay.

16:38.748 --> 16:39.520
Hey, babe, do we have any
appletinis for Andre?

16:39.640 --> 16:42.367
I'm not drinking liquor,
but I guess I can splurge.

16:42.487 --> 16:43.577
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:43.697 --> 16:44.571
You are so dead.

16:44.678 --> 16:45.545
You are done, dude.

16:45.612 --> 16:48.548
I'm not... The double entendres
are as dead as Ruxin's fake wife.

16:48.615 --> 16:49.749
No.

16:49.817 --> 16:51.651
Look, at least you have two
nice new little friends to play

16:51.719 --> 16:53.056
with during the off season.

16:53.176 --> 16:55.288
I don't even know why you would say that.
No...

16:55.356 --> 16:57.595
Were you talking, or just staring at your tits?

16:57.705 --> 16:58.438
You know what?

16:58.506 --> 17:01.733
Have fun without me, 'cause I'm gonna go
upstairs and watch the game by myself.

17:02.308 --> 17:03.091
Beef.

17:03.211 --> 17:04.310
Oh, they jiggle when he gets mad.

17:04.377 --> 17:05.545
Mm-hmm.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.517
God, it is so hot in here.

17:12.756 --> 17:13.917
Take this off.

17:14.042 --> 17:15.877
Just calm down.

17:16.157 --> 17:17.531
I just need to keep cool.

17:17.651 --> 17:19.945
Keep cool. Keep cool.

17:20.066 --> 17:23.594
That's better. I feel better already.
Just relax.

17:24.707 --> 17:25.996
Hey.

17:26.116 --> 17:28.144
- How's it going?
- Really well.

17:28.263 --> 17:29.611
Cappuccino machine for you.

17:29.731 --> 17:32.328
- Thank you.
- You're so welcome.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.750
How's Jeffrey? I'm dying to
see him. Where is he?

17:34.870 --> 17:37.373
He's napping.

17:37.493 --> 17:39.025
He is? Oh god, he must be
getting so big right now.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.075
- He's on solids, right?
- No-no, we're breastfeeding.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.552
- You.. you're breastfeeding? Still?
- Yeah.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.026
Why do anything else...

17:46.146 --> 17:47.875
...when you've got the best stuff
in those puppies?

17:48.155 --> 17:49.122
<i>Yeah. Leche de mama on tap.</i>

17:49.190 --> 17:50.123
That's what I'm saying.

17:50.191 --> 17:51.090
Just stop. Just... ew.

17:51.158 --> 17:52.091
Thank you.

17:52.159 --> 17:53.092
You're so welcome.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.296
I'm gonna make some soy lattes for the guy...
Yeah, you can make anything.

17:56.363 --> 17:58.298
You could do a cappuccino...
Ramona.

17:58.365 --> 17:59.499
Hmm?

17:59.567 --> 18:00.500
R-Ramona.

18:00.568 --> 18:01.701
No, he didn't.

18:01.769 --> 18:03.203
All right, I need this kick.

18:03.270 --> 18:05.271
Oh, Jeffrey, what's going on?

18:06.574 --> 18:07.707
See this guy right here?

18:07.775 --> 18:10.109
My whole season comes
down to this one kick.

18:10.177 --> 18:11.511
If he gets it, I'm golden.

18:11.579 --> 18:13.179
If not, it's all over.

18:13.247 --> 18:14.847
Oh, here it is.

18:14.915 --> 18:16.216
Oh! No!

18:17.851 --> 18:19.319
Oh, no.

18:21.789 --> 18:22.722
Yes!

18:22.790 --> 18:24.958
No psycho bull for this guy, huh?

18:25.025 --> 18:25.959
Rocky?!

18:26.026 --> 18:26.960
Yeah, babe.

18:27.027 --> 18:27.961
I'm gonna kill you.

18:28.028 --> 18:28.962
What?

18:29.029 --> 18:31.130
You lied about having a dead wife?

18:31.198 --> 18:33.333
No.
Babe, let me explain, okay?

18:33.400 --> 18:34.534
No, no, you sit back down.

18:34.602 --> 18:35.735
Oh.

18:35.803 --> 18:36.736
Listen to me.

18:36.804 --> 18:38.972
You have lied, and you named
her after a coffee maker.

18:39.039 --> 18:41.074
<i>It's actually the Consumer
Reports' number one cappuccino</i>

18:41.141 --> 18:41.975
maker in the country.

18:42.042 --> 18:42.976
Just for the record. Oh, okay.

18:43.043 --> 18:43.977
You know what? Shut up.

18:44.044 --> 18:44.978
<i>You're a pendejo.</i>

18:45.045 --> 18:45.979
<i>You're all pendejos.</i>

18:46.046 --> 18:47.981
<i>And I want all you
pendejos out of my house.</i>

18:48.048 --> 18:49.983
<i>And you take that big-titted
maricón Andre out of here,</i>

18:50.050 --> 18:51.150
too, you understand?

18:51.218 --> 18:53.219
You have three minutes to get
all these people out of here.

18:53.287 --> 18:54.153
Baby. Sofia?

18:54.221 --> 18:55.255
You know what?

18:55.322 --> 18:56.489
<i>Suck my huevos.</i>

18:56.557 --> 18:57.490
<i>Oh... oh.</i>

18:57.558 --> 18:58.691
<i>Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>

18:58.759 --> 19:00.927
<i>Oh-Oh... Oh, I'm sorry, oh...
Okay, okay. It's okay.</i>

19:00.995 --> 19:02.161
<i>Come here. Okay, it's okay.</i>

19:03.397 --> 19:04.530
<i>Oh.</i>

19:05.799 --> 19:07.834
<i>Oh, and thank you so much for
bringing a cappuccino maker with</i>

19:07.901 --> 19:08.835
<i>my dead wife's name on it.</i>

19:08.902 --> 19:09.902
<i>We don't use it anymore.</i>

19:09.970 --> 19:12.592
<i>Don't look a gift
horse in the mouth.</i>

19:12.712 --> 19:15.505
<i>Rodney Ruxin, born in 1982.</i>

19:15.723 --> 19:19.664
<i>Died in 2010 from multiple
stab wounds inflicted by his</i>

19:19.920 --> 19:21.516
<i>non-fictional wife Sofia.</i>

19:21.681 --> 19:23.051
<i>At least I'm finally
getting an obituary.</i>

19:23.171 --> 19:24.746
<i>Is there such a word as
better than perfect?</i>

19:26.518 --> 19:27.280
<i>It's Jeffrey.</i>

19:27.400 --> 19:29.114
<i>Oh, no.</i>

19:29.535 --> 19:31.418
<i>I was thinking I'd...
Oh, my God!</i>

19:31.538 --> 19:32.566
<i>Oh, thank God you're here.</i>

19:32.686 --> 19:34.429
- <i>He latched on.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

19:34.549 --> 19:35.958
<i>Please just get him off me.</i>
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

19:36.078 --> 19:37.360
- <i>What is going on?</i>
- <i>It hurts.</i>

19:37.480 --> 19:39.152
<i>It's like he's sucking my
nipples through a garden hose.</i>

19:39.272 --> 19:40.192
<i>Huh!</i>

19:42.707 --> 19:45.758
Taking calls. Adam, a special
treat right now... we're gonna

19:45.770 --> 19:47.462
go to a young lady, Ellie.

19:47.582 --> 19:48.898
Ellie, how can we help you?

19:49.018 --> 19:53.281
My mom is deployed to Afghanistan,
so she wanted me to call for her.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.752
Okay, well, let's try to help.
What's your question?

19:55.819 --> 19:56.753
What do you got going on today?

19:56.820 --> 20:01.057
Mommy wants to know if she
should play Jahvid Best versus

20:01.125 --> 20:03.565
the Bears, or Ricky Williams
vs. the Browns.

20:03.685 --> 20:05.973
That's a tough call, Adam.
Both guys doing very well.

20:06.093 --> 20:08.012
They're very very close.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.760
Which one is better?
Rank them.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.067
Which one is better?
Rank them.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.547
Adam, this is eerily familiar.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.532
Ellie, is there someone
in the room with you?

20:15.652 --> 20:17.118
- Yeah, my daddy.
- No, not your daddy.

20:17.238 --> 20:18.266
He hates your show.

20:18.386 --> 20:19.793
It's that dude from last week.

20:19.913 --> 20:22.392
K-Dog making his
daughter call the show.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.562
This is an all-time low.

20:24.682 --> 20:28.188
My daddy said he'd rather
listen to those mushmouthed

20:28.308 --> 20:32.902
<i>Bean Town jackasses on Call Talk
than the crap that you belch out</i>

20:33.022 --> 20:33.934
<i>of your pie holes.</i>

20:34.054 --> 20:35.908
<i>You know what, Ellie?</i>
<i>Your dad is still banned.</i>

20:36.028 --> 20:38.853
<i>And Ellie, it is a permanent
timeout for you, as well.</i>

20:38.973 --> 20:40.395
<i>You are banned from the program.</i>

20:40.463 --> 20:41.563
<i>I did it!</i>

20:41.631 --> 20:43.157
<i>Ellie. Ellie.</i>

20:43.423 --> 20:45.467
<i>Please don't call
Social Services.</i>
