00:04.367 --> 00:06.600
-Mae: So who is this guy?

00:06.633 --> 00:08.433
-Josh: Ben.
-Mae: Oh.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.567
-Dad: I used to drive Ben
and Josh to swimming club.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.167
-Josh: Not that Ben.
Different Ben.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.167
-Uh... it's-- Oh!

00:23.667 --> 00:24.767
-Get out of the way!

00:29.700 --> 00:31.767
I don't understand why
you want us to come.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.167
-I just needed a lift.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.267
-What is Tom doing?

00:36.300 --> 00:37.567
-He's busy.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.067
-I don't believe that.

00:45.733 --> 00:46.833
-So what's wrong with Ben?

00:46.867 --> 00:49.067
-He's having
surgery on his brain.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.800
-You know, I think
maybe you called us
because you need us.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.100
-Just a lift.

00:53.133 --> 00:54.667
-No, you need your Dad.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.233
-Did you call us because
you need me, Josh?

00:56.267 --> 00:58.067
-Yeah, you love your Dad.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.600
-Uh, is this--
Is this the right level?
-I think so.

01:00.633 --> 01:02.667
-I think I saw Day Surgery
was on Level 4, though.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.267
-This is Level 4.
-Yes, it is.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.333
-Josh, why don't you
admit you love your Dad?

01:06.367 --> 01:08.367
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you, too, Josh.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.367
Just let me know
if you need me
to sign anything.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.533
-Please sit down.

01:11.567 --> 01:14.267
Hi, I'm looking
for my friend's room.
Ben Robinson.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.633
-Oh, lovely.
What's your name?

01:16.667 --> 01:17.967
-(stutters) Josh.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.100
Sorry, I don't know why
I said it like I was
checking with you.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.767
It's Josh.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.400
-He has some family in there
with him at the moment.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.333
-Of cour--
Yeah, of course,
he has a family.

01:28.367 --> 01:30.467
Yeah, family is what they
really cherish in this time.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.767
-Shall I let them
know you're here?

01:31.800 --> 01:34.100
-No, that suddenly
feels a little bit silly.

01:34.133 --> 01:35.500
Um, we have to go.

01:35.533 --> 01:37.533
-Josh!
-What?

01:37.567 --> 01:38.700
-Josh!
-Why didn't--

01:38.733 --> 01:40.000
-Why can't he--
-Alan!

01:42.533 --> 01:44.433
Help your son.

01:44.467 --> 01:45.633
-Josh!

01:48.233 --> 01:50.367
Josh!

01:50.400 --> 01:54.500
-Okay. Okay, you need
to explain who Ben is.

01:54.533 --> 01:56.667
-No, I don't. He's a boy.
He is just a boy.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.933
-Oh, okay fine.

01:57.967 --> 02:00.533
But I still think you should be
brave and go see him, though.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.033
-Yeah, what's the worst
that could happen?
-Yeah.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.833
-He could die,

02:04.867 --> 02:07.067
and then every time I have
two white wines I'll get sad

02:07.100 --> 02:09.133
and then nobody'll
invite me to parties.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.400
I haven't told anybody.
Not Tom, not Claire.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.000
I don't know why.

02:35.567 --> 02:38.333
-Josh, mate, I think you need
to go back and see him.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.500
-Yeah, listen to your Dad.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.433
-No. No, no, no, thank you.

02:50.333 --> 02:51.467
All right, all right.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.133
-* One, two,
one, two, three, four *

02:56.133 --> 02:58.600
-* Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah

03:01.367 --> 03:03.133
* Oh, yeah

03:03.167 --> 03:04.700
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

03:05.700 --> 03:07.300
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

03:08.267 --> 03:10.133
* I left better behind to be

03:10.167 --> 03:13.367
* Fine, yeah, yeah

03:13.400 --> 03:16.367
* Make my momma turn
another blind eye *

03:16.400 --> 03:18.433
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

03:18.467 --> 03:21.400
-* I left better
behind to be fine *

03:29.667 --> 03:31.300
-Hi.
-Hello.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.633
Ah, Josh, these
are my parents.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.067
Mum, Dad, this is Josh.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.400
-Hello, Mister and Missus Ben.
-Hi, Josh.

03:37.433 --> 03:38.667
-Hello.
-Hello, Josh.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.467
Um, we were just going to get
a cup of tea. Did you want one?

03:41.500 --> 03:43.067
-No, I don't like tea.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.600
-Oh, all right.
We'll be back soon.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.667
-Thanks.

03:49.567 --> 03:50.667
I love tea.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.100
Yeah.

03:52.133 --> 03:55.267
I don't know why
I was just a bit weirdly
aggressive about the tea.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.600
-Is it weird that you
just met my parents?

03:58.633 --> 04:01.433
-Hmm. So I forgot
to get you anything,

04:01.467 --> 04:02.800
and then I got you
this ice cream,

04:02.833 --> 04:05.467
then they told me
you're not allowed to eat,

04:05.500 --> 04:08.033
but I wanted you
to see that I tried.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.467
-Did you get yourself one?

04:09.500 --> 04:11.200
-Yeah, no.
-Do you want to eat it?

04:11.233 --> 04:12.767
-Fuck yes, I do.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
You look fine.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.500
-You sound
annoyed about it.

04:21.533 --> 04:24.567
-Well, I was all
mentally prepared to see

04:24.600 --> 04:26.800
tubes and things
going inside you.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.367
-Oh, sorry.

04:28.400 --> 04:33.100
Yeah, that all comes after,
that stuff, and you look
pretty awful, actually.

04:33.133 --> 04:35.833
-Yeah, well, I thought
it'd be rude to turn up

04:35.867 --> 04:38.167
looking healthy,
so I didn't moisturize.

04:39.633 --> 04:40.767
-Oh, right.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.167
-Yeah, I'm gonna go now.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.467
It's just nothing.
It's just--

04:50.500 --> 04:53.467
I think maybe your parents
like you more than I do.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.233
-I'll call you when
I get out of here, okay?

04:56.267 --> 04:58.700
-Mmm. Yeah,
obviously, obviously.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.200
-If I don't die.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.500
-Yes.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.600
-Hannah: Yeah.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.433
-Mum: Oh, I'm pooped.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.400
Oh, Hannah!
-Yeah.

05:19.433 --> 05:22.733
-Did you sneak licorice
into the shopping?
Oh, it's yucky!

05:22.767 --> 05:24.300
-3:00?

05:24.333 --> 05:28.300
Yeah, no,
I'll definitely be
home by 3:00.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.633
Yeah, it'll be good
to see you too, yeah.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.733
Yeah, life certainly
does get busy, yep.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.133
No, you hang up first.

05:41.167 --> 05:45.267
-Hannah, there's no more
room for the groceries
in the kitchen.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.667
-We're losing the blender.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.333
-Huh?
-My ex.

05:48.367 --> 05:49.833
Debbie wants it back.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.400
-Oh, shit.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.100
Oh!

06:00.833 --> 06:03.367
-(both groan in disgust)

06:03.400 --> 06:06.067
-That's been there since
your green smoothie phase.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.700
-Oh!
-Day.

06:07.733 --> 06:11.300
-Look, we can't possibly
let her see the house.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.333
We want to trick her into
thinking you're a big success.

06:14.367 --> 06:16.000
Right.

06:40.767 --> 06:41.767
-Arnold: Josh?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.033
-Josh: Hi.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.067
-Are you hiding?

06:45.100 --> 06:47.167
-Yup, yeah.
Yeah, I'm hiding.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
-From me?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.367
-Mostly.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.733
-What did I do?

06:51.767 --> 06:54.300
-Nothing.

06:54.333 --> 06:57.667
-Actually, I did do something,
but I'm not sure now's the right
time to talk about it.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.400
-Okay, go.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.800
-Um, I washed John.

07:02.833 --> 07:04.567
-Great.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.300
-But I ran out of dog shampoo
and I used your shampoo instead,
so you're out of shampoo.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.133
-Okay.

07:10.167 --> 07:12.033
-Why are you
hiding from me?

07:12.067 --> 07:15.133
-I had sex with a guy.
A guy that is not you.

07:15.167 --> 07:16.467
-That's allowed.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.733
You know that's allowed.

07:17.767 --> 07:21.200
-Okay, I have to
tell you the story,
because I meet, right,

07:21.233 --> 07:24.267
this person, he turned out
to be a real weird,
annoying freak boy.

07:24.300 --> 07:28.067
Exactly the type of person
who gets excited to see
my penis, right?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.133
No offense.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.500
-He's not in there, is he?

07:31.533 --> 07:33.500
-Funny. So freak boy and I,
we had the sex, right?

07:33.533 --> 07:37.733
Mediocre. And then he decides
to tell me all about his big
aneurysm in his brain.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.533
You know what that is,
but I didn't, but you would.

07:39.567 --> 07:42.200
It's bad, yeah? It's shit.
It's real-- It's real bad.

07:42.233 --> 07:45.333
A few weeks later
this guy, his name is Ben,
he calls me and he says,

07:45.367 --> 07:48.667
"I'm getting an operation
on my shit brain and I might
die. Please come and see me."

07:48.700 --> 07:50.733
At first,
I was a bit confused
at why he'd ask me,

07:50.767 --> 07:53.667
but then I remembered
what a weird freak boy he was,
and it made a lot of sense,

07:53.700 --> 07:55.667
and he has no one
in his life to call except me,

07:55.700 --> 07:58.800
the other weird guy from
the Internet who briefly
touched his penis once.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.767
-Okay. Are you done?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.367
-This morning I went
to the hospital, right,
because I am a nice guy,

08:03.400 --> 08:06.767
when I go visit someone
to say hi a few hours before
they maybe die in surgery.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.633
-Okay.

08:13.467 --> 08:14.467
You like him?

08:14.500 --> 08:16.667
-Yes, but not romantically.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.667
Look, it's going to be
a weird day, okay,

08:18.700 --> 08:21.167
waiting for a hospital call
to tell me if this boy
is alive or not.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.133
You're going to see
a lot of concern in my eyes,

08:23.167 --> 08:25.400
but I need you to know
that while it's all a bit much,

08:25.433 --> 08:27.100
I'm not romantically interested,

08:27.133 --> 08:29.167
no matter what happens
today with the life or death.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.400
-Does he like you?

08:30.433 --> 08:31.733
-Yes.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.233
I love you.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.433
-Tom: Why won't you tell me what
happened between you and Josh?

08:41.467 --> 08:43.767
-Because it's nothing.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.100
-Tom: Are you guys going
on "The Amazing Race"
without me?

08:46.133 --> 08:47.800
-No.
-Guys,

08:47.833 --> 08:50.767
I've been thinking about
the massive ferris wheel and
how we should go on it today.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.700
-Is it that you're
jealous of my career?

08:52.733 --> 08:53.700
-Yes.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.733
-I just don't know what
you would keep from me.

08:56.767 --> 08:59.700
-I know everyone thinks
it's lame because it's just
a copy of the one in London,

08:59.733 --> 09:02.400
but we aren't in London,
so it will have to do.

09:02.433 --> 09:04.367
-Ella, we're not going
on the Observation Wheel.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.600
-Ooh, too fancy
to say ferris wheel?

09:07.633 --> 09:10.467
Big Tom, with his
big fancy terms.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.667
-Are you guys
having a baby?

09:11.700 --> 09:12.700
-Please shut up!

09:12.733 --> 09:14.733
-Oh, my God. I nailed it.
They're having a baby.

09:14.767 --> 09:17.033
-Tom, I promise you,
you want to shut up.

09:17.067 --> 09:19.300
-Why? I just--
-Because I had
an abortion, okay?

09:19.333 --> 09:21.067
It's not something
that you do on your own.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.733
I don't have a partner,
and I had to take Josh. Fuck!

09:23.767 --> 09:25.400
-Oh, Claire,
I'm sorry. That's rough.

09:25.433 --> 09:27.500
-No, it's not,
it's fine. I'm fine.

09:28.633 --> 09:30.233
I'm just glad
I got him to shut up.

09:34.633 --> 09:35.700
-Why didn't you tell me?

09:35.733 --> 09:38.333
-(groans)
-Tom! She doesn't
have to tell you.

09:38.367 --> 09:40.067
-She told Josh.
-So?

09:40.100 --> 09:41.300
-Yeah, I can tell
whoever I want.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.500
-Yeah, what the hell?

09:42.533 --> 09:45.467
It's our choice what we do
with our bodies and who we tell.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.833
You're such the patriarchy.

09:46.867 --> 09:50.300
-Yeah, I really hate
how you're always such
the patriarchy, Tom.

09:50.333 --> 09:51.400
-I'm not the patriarchy.

09:51.433 --> 09:53.433
-Well, I am not going to let
the patriarchy tell me

09:53.467 --> 09:55.067
that I can't go on
the massive ferris wheel.

09:58.367 --> 09:59.767
-Yuck! They're having sex!

09:59.800 --> 10:01.467
-Josh: We're not
having sex.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.667
-Are you guys
having sex?

10:02.700 --> 10:04.067
-We aren't having sex.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.367
-Ah! I wanted to see.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.667
-Ah, Tom and Ella and I
are going to go to the ferris
wheel. Do you want to come?

10:09.700 --> 10:11.733
-Um...

10:11.767 --> 10:13.500
Are you up to going
on the ferris wheel?

10:13.533 --> 10:16.233
-Um, yeah, I could. You?

10:16.267 --> 10:18.667
-Yeah, yeah, I could go.
That will be fun.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.200
-Are you sure?

10:20.233 --> 10:21.667
-Oh, my God.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.433
What the fuck type of attitude
is that for a ferris wheel?

10:24.467 --> 10:27.167
That is not the right
tone for a ferris wheel.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.233
-Why are you doing that?

10:31.267 --> 10:34.267
Oh, why did you pick that?
They were in the cupboard.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.433
-I want to tidy the cupboard
so we can fit things in.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.500
-Oh, okay.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.033
-Get your own cupboard!

10:45.067 --> 10:46.433
-(exclaiming dismissively)

10:58.767 --> 11:00.033
-(exclaiming)

11:00.067 --> 11:02.333
-Cheers, guys!

11:02.367 --> 11:04.767
-Okay, so I know you don't
want to talk about it.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.233
I just want to make
sure that you are okay.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.633
-Yeah! Yeah, I'm fine.

11:10.667 --> 11:15.600
I'm drinking champagne
in the sky on a ferris wheel.
I'm okay.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.300
-Meanwhile, what's
going on with you two?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.367
-Nothing.
-Something.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.500
-Definitely something.

11:21.533 --> 11:27.200
-(sighs) So, Josh's friend,
Ben, is in the hospital.

11:27.233 --> 11:28.233
-What happened to Ben?

11:28.267 --> 11:30.200
-Okay, so you
guys know Ben?

11:30.233 --> 11:31.500
-Uh--

11:31.533 --> 11:33.667
-I've heard of Ben.
-Josh: Yes.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.333
Everyone knows Ben.

11:35.367 --> 11:36.733
-I don't know Ben.

11:36.767 --> 11:38.533
-How does everyone
know Ben?

11:38.567 --> 11:39.600
-He came to the house.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.800
-What happened to Ben?

11:40.833 --> 11:45.133
-I went and visited him today.
He's having brain surgery.

11:45.167 --> 11:47.667
-He's having brain surgery?
Like now?

11:47.700 --> 11:50.700
-Surgery of the brain?
-Yeah.

11:50.733 --> 11:53.733
-Well, how are we meant
to enjoy the Observation Wheel
knowing that?

11:53.767 --> 11:56.600
-I don't know, Tom.
Maybe just pretend
you don't know.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.800
-I can't do that.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.467
-I had a funny story
about a poodle, but...

12:00.500 --> 12:01.567
I'll save it
for another day.

12:02.667 --> 12:04.467
-Should be stop
drinking the champagne?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.800
-It feels a little bit
inappropriate now.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.700
-When are you going
to find out how it goes, Josh?

12:07.733 --> 12:10.367
-Ah, not for a while.
The hospital's going
to call me.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.667
-You're on his
hospital call list?

12:12.700 --> 12:13.600
-Yeah, he put me on it.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.733
-I had no idea you kept
seeing each other.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.600
-We didn't.
-He didn't.

12:17.633 --> 12:18.833
-When will he call?

12:18.867 --> 12:20.700
-Not for ages.
-(cell phone ringing)

12:23.733 --> 12:25.467
-Is that them?
-It's a blocked number.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.167
-Tom: Oh, my God, it's them.
-No, it's too early.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.700
-Not if he died
at the start of surgery.

12:29.733 --> 12:31.133
-Why would you say that?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.400
-Sorry, I was just
thinking out loud.

12:32.433 --> 12:33.633
-Hello.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.833
-We need your help cleaning,
Josh. Come and save us, Joshie.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.467
-Mum, why is your
number blocked?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.533
-Oh, just Stuart.
We're in lockdown.

12:40.567 --> 12:41.800
-Hi, Rose.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.767
-You come and help
your mum clean up!

12:43.800 --> 12:45.233
-I can't.
I'm out with friends.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.767
-I'm worried about
all this time you're spending
with friends, Josh.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.567
-(chuckles) I just--
I just can't, okay?
I'm in the Observation Wheel.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.533
-Oh! Oh, well, I have
an observation for you.

12:54.567 --> 12:57.267
Have you ever noticed
how Josh never helps
his poor, sick mum clean?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.700
What's the deal
with that, then? Goodbye!

12:59.733 --> 13:01.300
-Okay, bye.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.133
My mum's manic,
so there's that.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.167
-How'd you meet Ben?

13:05.433 --> 13:08.233
-On Grindr.
Then he came over.

13:08.267 --> 13:12.067
-Trust Josh to try and have
casual sex and then wind up
in the hospital.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.433
-He outstayed his welcome,
okay? We chatted, it was nice,

13:14.467 --> 13:16.100
but I told him I didn't
want to see him again.

13:16.133 --> 13:17.533
-But you did.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.233
-Once, in hospital.

13:19.267 --> 13:21.833
-Tom: Why didn't you tell us
you'd seen him again?

13:21.867 --> 13:25.367
-It-- It was just weird.
It was just really weird.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.700
I didn't want
to talk about it.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.467
-I just don't understand
why you wouldn't tell us.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.533
I tell you everything.
I wouldn't have judged you.

13:30.567 --> 13:33.100
-I'm not told anything.
I told you about my chlamydia.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.467
-I understand why
I wasn't told.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.767
-You guys know
I have a lot of empathy.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.233
-No, you have the same
amount of empathy
as everyone else.

13:39.267 --> 13:41.367
-No, I have--
I have extra empathy.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.567
-Not true.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.567
-So, I mean, you obviously
care about this guy a lot, Josh.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.433
-Fuck!

13:48.467 --> 13:51.100
He's just maybe going
to die, all right?
I don't know.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.200
-You seem quite upset.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.233
-Oh, yeah, did you notice that
with your super empathy?

13:55.267 --> 13:58.400
-Just when people are maybe
going to die, they seem a bit
extra special.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.067
I got carried away, yes?

14:02.533 --> 14:05.033
-You have a rescue complex.

14:05.067 --> 14:08.233
-Are you talking about me there,
when you say that about
his rescue complex?

14:08.267 --> 14:10.233
-Well, you did meet
in a mental home.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.767
-(chuckling)
-Stunning empathy.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.833
-(cell phone ringing)

14:13.867 --> 14:16.067
-Tom: That's gotta be them.
Everyone else is here.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.100
-Hello, this is Josh.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.600
-Oh, hi, Josh, it's Dad.

14:21.633 --> 14:22.900
-Dad, why is your
number blocked, okay?

14:22.933 --> 14:25.100
Unless Stuart calls you,
it's not going to make
a difference.

14:25.133 --> 14:28.367
-Um, no, I decided I don't want
people knowing my number.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.600
-People? What people?

14:29.633 --> 14:30.767
-Oh, people.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.267
Anyway, I called up to check.
Have you heard anything?

14:34.300 --> 14:35.267
-No.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.333
-Oh. Do you need anything?

14:37.367 --> 14:40.067
-I can't talk, okay?
I'm in the Observation Wheel.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.767
-Ooh! What's it like?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.267
-Yeah, you know,
it's not bad.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.833
-Right, just wait there.
-Okay.

14:46.867 --> 14:50.100
-Can you see my house?
Hang on, I'm coming.
I'm coming. Hang on.

14:50.133 --> 14:52.367
-No. No, not really.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.133
-Are you looking now?

14:54.167 --> 14:55.633
-Yeah.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.767
-Josh, I'm waving.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.367
-No, Dad, I can't see you.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.833
-Can you see me?
I'm waving and jumping!

15:02.867 --> 15:07.400
-(chuckles) No, I-- No, Dad,
I can't see you waving.

15:07.433 --> 15:10.067
-I'm wearing
a check shirt.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.567
-I'm gonna go. Bye.
-(Dad groans)

15:13.800 --> 15:15.767
-Tom: As least Josh
didn't tell anyone.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.400
You two went off and had
a little secret bonding moment.

15:18.433 --> 15:21.600
I've never had a bonding moment
with either of you. And I'm--
-(Claire laughing)

15:21.633 --> 15:26.133
I'm better at feelings
than Josh. I'm reliable.
I'm like the rock.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.200
I'm like the group rock.

15:28.233 --> 15:30.300
-Tom, the reason why
we didn't tell you is because

15:30.333 --> 15:32.133
we thought if you perceived
Claire to be in trouble,

15:32.167 --> 15:33.800
then you would fall
in love with her again.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.333
-Everyone has
a rescue complex.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.200
-Is that true?
-Claire: Yeah.

15:38.233 --> 15:41.833
Tom loves victims,
Josh loves victims. It's why
they love each other.

15:41.867 --> 15:43.200
-Am I a victim?

15:44.367 --> 15:45.567
-Not yet.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.367
-Do you think that you might
fall in love with Claire again?

15:48.400 --> 15:52.433
-No. You think I'd fall
in love with everyone
who's had an abortion?

15:52.467 --> 15:56.300
There are many people
who've had abortions
who I hate.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.200
-You really aren't
nailing it today.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.600
-I am drunk.

16:00.633 --> 16:04.700
-I admit that maybe
the ferris wheel wasn't
my best idea ever.

16:11.867 --> 16:13.267
-Hannah,
what are you doing?

16:15.233 --> 16:16.367
-I don't know.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.633
-You're just sitting there
like a gorilla in the mist.

16:19.667 --> 16:20.700
-I've been helping.

16:20.733 --> 16:22.800
-No, you are reading a book.

16:22.833 --> 16:25.367
The last time
I came over you were reading
the instructions to Monopoly.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.367
You know how
to play Monopoly.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.300
-Stop hassling! I sorted
out the plastic containers.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.267
-(laughs) Yeah. And why didn't
you go the rest of the way

16:33.300 --> 16:34.600
and actually put them
back in the cup--

16:34.633 --> 16:36.833
I could trip over that
and break my neck
if I'm not careful.

16:36.867 --> 16:38.533
-I'm sorry.

16:38.567 --> 16:43.367
I'm sorry I'm ruining your
scheme to trick other people
into thinking I'm a success.

16:43.400 --> 16:47.167
-No! No! No, that is
not the problem.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.300
I'm not the problem, Hannah.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.200
You're the problem.

16:55.700 --> 16:58.400
-Ella: So I know that today
mostly has to be about Josh,

16:58.433 --> 17:01.433
but can we just talk
about Claire for a second?

17:01.467 --> 17:04.033
-Tom: Sure, okay.

17:04.067 --> 17:08.833
-Um, can you tell me
what type of feelings
you have surrounding her?

17:08.867 --> 17:09.767
-For Claire?
-Yep.

17:09.800 --> 17:14.067
-Um, Claire, I feel
respect and kinship

17:14.100 --> 17:16.133
and I definitely do
care about her,

17:16.167 --> 17:20.367
especially when
it's health related,
like it has been recently.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.733
-And do you love her?

17:21.767 --> 17:25.733
-I do. I do love her.
I love her in the same way
I love pancakes.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.667
-(giggles)
-And Josh.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.167
-You love me?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.433
-Yep. And Arnold.
-Oh.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.467
-Even though that's
a newer friendship.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.133
-That's very
thoughtful, Tom.

17:34.167 --> 17:35.433
-Thank you, Arnold.

17:35.467 --> 17:38.533
-Tom, do you love me
as much as pancakes?

17:38.567 --> 17:40.033
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.300
-And what about,
like, romantically?

17:42.333 --> 17:44.833
Do you think that
you could ever fall
in love with her again?

17:44.867 --> 17:47.367
-You know I don't,
and I wish Josh
hadn't said that,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.467
because that is something
that's in the past, and--

17:50.500 --> 17:52.233
and I'll be honest with you,

17:52.267 --> 17:56.500
that was a part of my life
that took a while to get over.

17:56.533 --> 18:01.733
But genuinely, that's over,
and you know what?

18:01.767 --> 18:04.633
I-- You know, it feels really
good even to say that out loud.

18:04.667 --> 18:08.333
It's like-- It's like
the first time I've even
truly believed it myself.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.367
-Mmm-hmm.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.367
-(hesitantly)
Do you believe me?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.100
-Yeah.
-Good.

18:15.133 --> 18:16.633
Because it's true.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.500
-When was the last
time that you kissed?

18:24.433 --> 18:26.133
What's wrong?
-Nothing.

18:26.167 --> 18:27.800
-Tom, when was
the last time that
you kissed Claire?

18:29.367 --> 18:31.600
-Okay, so something
weird happened last week.

18:31.633 --> 18:34.200
-Claire?
-Oh, no, Ella, it really
was just nothing.

18:34.233 --> 18:36.767
-No! No, no, it's fine.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.600
I just want to, um--
Can you just explain
to me like what happened?

18:43.267 --> 18:44.700
-Claire was sad--
-No!

18:44.733 --> 18:47.667
Mmm-mmm. I wasn't.
That wasn't what it was, okay?

18:47.700 --> 18:51.467
We just-- We got locked
in his room so that Josh
could be alone with Ben.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.000
-Drunk.

18:53.033 --> 18:56.500
-Yeah. Okay, so yeah,
we were also drunk.
We had like two bottles of wine.

18:56.533 --> 18:59.567
And I don't know,
we just-- We had
nothing else to do.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.767
-Josh and Ben
were taking so long.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.500
-What?
-No.

19:03.533 --> 19:07.500
-Look, okay. Ella,
imagine like just
the grossest,

19:07.533 --> 19:10.433
most disgusting person
you've ever kissed.

19:10.467 --> 19:11.500
-Mmm-hmm.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.067
-How long did he stay?

19:13.100 --> 19:15.267
-Sorry, it wasn't that long.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.733
-Too long, okay? It's--
I let it get out of hand.
I'm not used to hook ups.

19:18.767 --> 19:20.067
-Well, did he sleep over?

19:21.100 --> 19:23.100
-Yeah, yeah.

19:23.133 --> 19:27.167
I didn't want him to.
He was just telling me
about his broken brain.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.267
-Over breakfast.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.467
-Look, if there was like
a glory hole for kissing,

19:31.500 --> 19:34.300
I probably would have gone
there, but they don't exist,
I don't think,

19:34.333 --> 19:36.567
so I just closed my eyes
and I kissed Tom instead.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.600
-Is that what it was
like for you, Tom?

19:38.633 --> 19:42.200
-Yeah. It was-- It was
like kissing my sister.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.733
Worse. I wish I had a sister
so I could have kissed her
instead.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.033
-Ella: You want to cheat on me
with your imaginary sister?

19:47.067 --> 19:51.067
-Um, how many times after
he slept over did you see him?

19:51.100 --> 19:52.800
-Once, when he was in hospital.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.133
-But you lied to everyone
about the hospital.

19:55.167 --> 19:58.100
-No, I did not lie.
I just didn't tell them.

19:58.133 --> 20:02.400
-Why would you go and see
someone in hospital if you'd
only met them once?

20:02.433 --> 20:05.267
-'Cause he called me
and asked me to come
and visit.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.833
-It just doesn't make
any sense, Josh.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.467
-I don't know what
you want me to say.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.767
That's what happened,
all right? I know it's weird,
but that's what happened.

20:10.800 --> 20:16.067
-Okay, so maybe the ferris wheel
wasn't my strongest idea ever.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.367
-You already said that.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.733
-(Arnold breathing heavily)

20:18.767 --> 20:21.667
-I thought no one heard,
Tom, 'cause no one laughed.

20:21.700 --> 20:25.033
-I want to get off
this fucking thing!
I want to get out.

20:25.067 --> 20:29.233
Where could I even go?
I can't go back to your house,
I can't live at Mum and Dad's.

20:30.233 --> 20:31.067
-Arnold, okay--

20:31.100 --> 20:33.100
-Don't touch me.
You can't touch me.

20:33.133 --> 20:34.600
-Josh, you can't touch him
when he's like that.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.567
-No, fuck you.
Just listen, all right?

20:36.600 --> 20:39.267
Okay, so how many people
do you think I meet a day?

20:39.300 --> 20:41.067
-I don't know.
On average, like, three.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.300
-How many is that a year?

20:42.333 --> 20:44.767
-(Arnold sighs) 1,095.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.467
-How long do you think
I've been capable
of romantic love?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.533
-10 years.
-Okay.

20:49.567 --> 20:51.400
So I fall in love with two
people in that time, right?

20:51.433 --> 20:54.800
So that's two people
in 10,950 which is one
in five thousand--

20:54.833 --> 20:57.100
-Four hundred
and seventy five.

20:57.133 --> 20:59.200
-...chance that I'm going
to meet someone
that I'm in love with,

20:59.233 --> 21:02.600
and there's a one in 5,475
chance that they're going
to love me back, okay?

21:02.633 --> 21:07.800
What's the chance my one,
meeting someone where
I'm they're one?

21:07.833 --> 21:11.033
-That's assuming that everyone
you meet could be someone that
you could fall in love with,

21:11.067 --> 21:13.233
where actually it's more likely
to be a subset of that number,

21:13.267 --> 21:15.467
based on like a defined
criteria around love.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.367
-Okay. If we ignore
the subset,
what's the number?

21:19.833 --> 21:22.233
-One in like 29 million.

21:22.267 --> 21:25.333
-Okay, so there's a one
in 29 million chance
I'm going to meet someone,

21:25.367 --> 21:27.300
I'm going to love them
and they're going
to love me back.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.167
How many people
are there in the world?
-Seven billion.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.100
-What's the chance of us
meeting, amongst that
seven billion,

21:33.133 --> 21:36.467
by the chance of us
the 29 million?

21:36.500 --> 21:39.333
-Well, that's just
not really a thing,

21:39.367 --> 21:42.100
but the calculation would be
just like a very, very, very
small number.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.733
-A tiny number.

21:43.767 --> 21:46.233
Very small. That's not even
taking into account whether
or not I was charming

21:46.267 --> 21:48.233
on that day, whether or not
they were charming on that day.

21:48.267 --> 21:50.000
Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:50.033 --> 21:55.533
-So there's a very small chance
that that number is a dope
called Ben I met on Grindr, yes?

21:56.567 --> 21:58.033
Yeah?

21:58.067 --> 22:00.333
I love you and you love me,
and it's just the most
remarkable coincidence.

22:02.267 --> 22:03.933
Okay?
-Okay.

22:03.967 --> 22:07.133
-Also, I've been meaning to talk
about whether or not you wanted
to move in permanently,

22:07.167 --> 22:08.800
but I don't know
if now's a great time.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.500
-I'll think about it.

22:11.533 --> 22:13.033
-Okay?

22:16.533 --> 22:18.067
-Oh, I take it back, guys.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.300
This has been thrilling.
"Great idea, Ella!"

22:21.333 --> 22:22.600
"Aw, thanks, guys."

22:24.067 --> 22:25.167
-Hannah: I told her
I couldn't be home

22:25.200 --> 22:28.200
because I had an emergency
meeting with my architect.

22:28.233 --> 22:29.800
-Mum: I really think
you should have cleaned it.

22:29.833 --> 22:33.400
-I'm too busy. Plus,
it's not mine anymore.

22:35.467 --> 22:36.533
-Okay.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.567
Is she normally on time?

22:42.600 --> 22:44.367
-Very much so.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.800
-Well, I can't see where
we left the blender, so maybe--

22:47.833 --> 22:50.133
How will we know
if she's already
picked it up?

22:50.167 --> 22:51.600
-Maybe she's already been.

22:51.633 --> 22:54.500
-Oh! (shouting)
Hey, Debbie!

22:54.533 --> 22:56.633
Debbie, are you there, Debbie?

22:56.667 --> 22:59.200
Debbie, you dumb slut!

22:59.233 --> 23:01.033
Debbie, you are
a dumb slut!

23:01.067 --> 23:03.267
-No, please stop,
please stop. Just stop.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.067
-Is that a bit too
close to the bone?

23:05.100 --> 23:06.733
Is that what she was like?
Was she like that?

23:06.767 --> 23:08.100
-Quite the opposite.

23:08.133 --> 23:09.800
-(laughing hysterically)

23:12.633 --> 23:16.367
-Tom: Here he is,
with the ribs.
What a hero.

23:18.133 --> 23:19.333
-Thank you, Thomas.
-You're welcome.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.767
Arnold, I'm sorry.
There is some more quiche
there if you would like.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.567
-I'm not hungry.

23:28.233 --> 23:32.600
-Josh: Mmm. It's delicious.
It's fucking delicious.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.667
Mmm.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.300
-(clock chimes, cuckoos)

23:47.500 --> 23:49.000
-(cell phone ringing)

23:50.267 --> 23:51.600
-Sorry.

23:54.167 --> 23:55.267
Can you--

24:02.533 --> 24:04.467
Hello.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.700
Yeah, this is Josh.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.233
Hi.

24:08.267 --> 24:10.033
Okay, that's great.

24:10.067 --> 24:13.067
Thank you. Thanks.
They hung up.

24:14.667 --> 24:15.800
-He's all right?

24:15.833 --> 24:17.600
-Yeah no, he's fine.
Yeah, he's-- He's good.

24:17.633 --> 24:19.767
-Good. That's great.

24:19.800 --> 24:23.367
-(rock music playing)
