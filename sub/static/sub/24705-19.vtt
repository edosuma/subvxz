He's gonna die now.

00:11.653 --> 00:14.247
-He thinks l don't love him.
-He knows you love him.

your lawful wedded husband?

00:19.613 --> 00:20.602
l do.

00:20.813 --> 00:24.249
l haven't seen you for 3 years.
Where you hiding your liquor?

00:24.453 --> 00:27.331
l've been a lousy father,
but l always loved you.

-Yeah.

-He wants to talk to a detective.
-Look, l'm gonna do it.

00:58.533 --> 01:00.489
EDDlE:
Here's what l need to know.

01:01.173 --> 01:07.282
lf a person was involved in a type
of situation, and he didn't know. . .

01:08.573 --> 01:13.488
. . .and now he came forward,
cooperating, trying to assist. . .

01:16.053 --> 01:18.726
-. . .how would he stand?
-Give more hints.

01:18.933 --> 01:21.128
What was the situation?

01:21.333 --> 01:26.009
A possibility of disposing a body.
The person had no idea.

01:26.213 --> 01:30.764
-The person knows it was a body now.
-He figured it out, subsequently.

01:30.973 --> 01:36.093
Or maybe even at the situation, he's
thinking, ''This is a pretty heavy rug. ''

01:36.293 --> 01:41.162
So let's say he knew it was a body
but didn't help with getting it dead?

01:41.373 --> 01:45.048
Say that then.
How jammed up would he be then?

01:45.213 --> 01:50.162
Coming in, being cooperative, assuming
he didn't have any part in the death--

01:50.373 --> 01:53.206
Absolutely not. l'm at a party.

01:53.413 --> 01:56.007
Guy asked me to help him.
He's my host.

01:56.173 --> 01:59.404
-He asked you to take out a rug?
-Take a rug outside.

01:59.653 --> 02:04.204
-Somebody from the party's in the rug?
-That's my guess. After the fact.

02:04.413 --> 02:08.485
-Who would that be?
-l think a girl.

02:08.733 --> 02:09.882
Marilyn.

02:10.173 --> 02:13.449
Because she wasn't around afterward.

02:13.653 --> 02:17.089
-What would she be to the guy?
-His girlfriend.

02:17.333 --> 02:21.167
They'd been beefing all night,
going at each other.

02:21.373 --> 02:25.002
Maybe l saw the top of her
head rolled up in the rug.

02:25.253 --> 02:30.202
l mean, going over it in my mind,
maybe l glimpsed something like that.

02:30.453 --> 02:33.763
-He got a name?
-Tell me what my situation would be.

02:33.933 --> 02:36.686
Probably okay,
but stop playing dimwit.

02:37.573 --> 02:41.805
-What's the guy's name?
-Ricky Testa.

02:42.053 --> 02:45.841
SlPOWlCZ: Where'd you put the rug?
-A dumpster in an alley. . .

02:46.053 --> 02:48.965
. . .outside the old post office garage.

02:49.813 --> 02:52.930
-Fifth, between B and C.
-This was last night?

02:53.093 --> 02:55.084
-Three nights ago.
-Three nights ago?

02:55.293 --> 02:59.081
KELLY: Thanks for rushing over.
SlPOWlCZ: Know where that body'll be?

02:59.333 --> 03:02.882
ln a garbage dump. And who's
gonna go looking for it?

03:03.053 --> 03:05.772
-Picking through tons of garbage?
-We are.

03:05.933 --> 03:09.084
Crapped on by a bunch
of overweight sea gulls.

03:09.253 --> 03:11.813
ln terms of my being jammed up. . . .

03:12.013 --> 03:13.685
-l'll be all right?
SlPOWlCZ: Yeah.

03:13.893 --> 03:18.489
You're gonna be all right. We're
gonna be up to our asses in garbage.

Serge the Concierge

04:30.373 --> 04:31.601
Story sounds good.

04:31.853 --> 04:34.811
Girl got reported missing
two nights ago.

04:34.973 --> 04:38.409
KELLY: Marilyn Amico. Her mother says
she dates Ricky Testa.

04:38.573 --> 04:42.009
There's no answer at Testa's.
We contacted the super.

04:42.173 --> 04:46.132
Testa took off for the Dominican
two days ago.

04:46.293 --> 04:49.410
We checked this dumpster that
Eddie said he dumped the rug in.

04:49.573 --> 04:51.723
The city serviced it Tuesday.

04:51.973 --> 04:55.682
So either it's on a garbage scow
or out in Fresh Kills landfill.

04:55.853 --> 04:58.572
-Sanitation helping?
-They're tracking it.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.611
We'll start as soon as
they give us the okay.

05:01.773 --> 05:05.288
-Have Medavoy and Martinez help.
-They're on standby.

05:05.493 --> 05:08.087
Three days this idiot waited.

05:10.573 --> 05:11.608
DONNA:
May l help you?

05:11.813 --> 05:13.929
SlPOWlCZ: lt's time to suit up.
We're going to the dump.

05:14.773 --> 05:15.808
Hey, Robin.

05:17.653 --> 05:19.848
-What's going on?
-Hey, Johnny.

05:21.173 --> 05:22.492
Jimmy died.

05:24.653 --> 05:26.291
l'm sorry.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.521
l'm sorry.

05:28.733 --> 05:31.293
You know what? Let's go over here.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.325
-He died in his sleep. lt was peaceful.
-Good.

05:45.773 --> 05:49.368
-He's out of his pain now.
-Yeah.

05:51.773 --> 05:56.130
-ls there a memorial service?
-No, he didn't want anything.

05:56.373 --> 06:00.810
He had me down at the track putting
his ashes on the finish line.

06:02.253 --> 06:06.246
Ashes on the finish
and 99-1 on the tote board.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.683
That's what Jimmy wanted.

06:11.533 --> 06:13.046
l'm. . . .

06:13.253 --> 06:16.051
-l'm going away for a while.
-Good idea.

06:16.893 --> 06:19.009
My plane leaves at 1 1 tonight.

06:19.173 --> 06:24.770
-Any chance we could catch some dinner?
-Absolutely. l'll call you later. Okay?

06:27.533 --> 06:30.730
Hey, Robin. You gonna be okay?

06:30.973 --> 06:33.123
-Yeah, l'll be fine.
-You sure?

06:33.373 --> 06:36.092
All right. We'll talk later.

06:45.733 --> 06:46.768
Make book on it.

06:46.933 --> 06:50.767
l'm gonna get a skin reaction
after we're out at that dump.

06:50.973 --> 06:55.330
You're gonna see me come down with
dizziness and an allergic breakout.

06:55.533 --> 06:58.684
Well, l'll keep a close eye on you.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.613
Large in Taiwan
is not large in America.

07:03.413 --> 07:06.723
They dump 1 3,000 tons
in that landfill every day.

07:06.893 --> 07:10.442
SlPOWlCZ: Well, sanitation gave us
the sector number 6-7.

07:10.613 --> 07:12.126
So you know that means?

07:12.333 --> 07:14.324
Since we know which sector. . .

07:14.533 --> 07:19.527
. . .we only have to pick through
4 or 500 tons out of the whole 1 3,000.

07:19.733 --> 07:21.928
Those places are like
giant petri dishes.

07:22.173 --> 07:23.162
[KNOCKlNG ]

07:23.333 --> 07:25.688
-Everybody decent?

07:27.613 --> 07:32.403

Uh-huh.

-Listen, l'm sorry.
-Do what you gotta do.

08:12.253 --> 08:15.529
-John--
-Hey, don't worry about it.

08:16.973 --> 08:19.885
-What's going on?
-Let me ask you something.

08:22.093 --> 08:27.121
Do you know a Nick Savino,
Manhattan North, Narcotics?

08:27.373 --> 08:30.968
He just popped Andy for selling coke.

08:31.133 --> 08:32.804
Did you talk to the guy?

08:33.053 --> 08:36.409
He's out undercover.
He'll be back in a few hours.

08:36.613 --> 08:39.809
That don't sound like Andy, does it?

08:41.332 --> 08:43.801
l don't know what he's into lately.

08:43.972 --> 08:47.602
-l gotta go to the 8th. See you later.
-All right.

Thanks for calling me.

09:07.373 --> 09:10.729
l know how this feels.
l got a brother who's a mess.

09:10.893 --> 09:14.090
Every time l think he's square,
it starts again.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.325
-My kid's never been arrested.
-Yeah, well. . . .

09:17.573 --> 09:21.486
Savino's on his way back in.
l asked around about the pop.

09:21.653 --> 09:25.885
A month ago, he made three buys.
Got a warrant on a John Doe dealer.

09:26.053 --> 09:29.523
Today he spots your son,
lD's him as the pusher. . .

09:29.693 --> 09:31.763
. . .and brings him in.

09:32.173 --> 09:36.007
-What kind of a cop's Savino?
-Makes about 20 collars a month.

09:36.253 --> 09:39.484
-That stand up?
-Yeah, they tend to stand up.

09:39.733 --> 09:43.009
-Want to see your boy?
-Yeah.

09:54.173 --> 09:56.129
lt's okay, really. He's fine.

09:56.373 --> 10:00.685

-All right. Thanks, Jack.

-Yeah.

10:32.813 --> 10:34.132

10:34.293 --> 10:37.171
On my way to work,
l got arrested by two cops.

10:37.373 --> 10:38.647
You know what for?

10:38.853 --> 10:41.925
They said l sold coke
to a narc three weeks ago.

10:42.173 --> 10:44.323
-Did you do that?
-No.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.366
-You believe me?
-Why wouldn't l believe you?

10:47.573 --> 10:51.327
Why would you believe me?
You don't know me very well.

10:52.573 --> 10:55.292
You're telling me you didn't do it.

10:55.493 --> 10:59.805
lf you did, tell me now, and
we'll take these things from there.

11:00.053 --> 11:02.487
l didn't sell any coke.

11:02.653 --> 11:07.124
l don't have anything to do
with any drugs or alcohol.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.130
There's gotta be a mix-up.

11:13.293 --> 11:17.081
l'll talk to the cop that arrested you.
You need anything?

11:17.293 --> 11:19.488

Try and take it easy.

-You just took my son down this morning.
-Yeah, l'm sorry it was your kid.

My son says he didn't do it.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.848
-He sold to me.
-l believe my son.

12:02.053 --> 12:07.207
l made three directs off him.
l spot him in the same area this morning.

12:07.453 --> 12:12.766
-He works in that neighborhood.
-When l saw him, he was selling drugs.

12:13.493 --> 12:17.725
Would you do this? Keep the
kid in holding for the rest of today.

12:17.893 --> 12:21.283
Don't run him through yet.
Let me look around a bit.

12:21.493 --> 12:26.123
-You're wasting your time. He's it.
-Then it's my time getting wasted.

12:26.293 --> 12:31.128
We're in the same job together.
l'm not asking you to do anything illegal.

12:32.173 --> 12:34.812
-Savino, phone.
-Right. l got a call.

12:35.053 --> 12:37.089

12:39.413 --> 12:42.803
All right, go ahead.
l'll stall the paperwork.

12:42.973 --> 12:45.487
Would you go take a Polaroid of him?

12:45.653 --> 12:46.722
For what?

12:46.973 --> 12:52.206
l want to show his photo on the street.
l don't have a recent likeness.

12:54.533 --> 12:57.889
-Yeah. Hey, take a message.
MCCABE: Yeah, no problem.

12:58.253 --> 12:59.971

13:22.053 --> 13:26.524
Join the police department. Stand up
to your knees in gooey condoms.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.412
MARTlNEZ:
We shouldn't just look for the rug.

13:29.653 --> 13:35.046
She could have rolled out when the
garbage truck turned over the dumpster.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.770
-That's it! That's it!
KELLY: Greg!

13:39.973 --> 13:42.965

Well, here's a 65-year-old male,

You'll never see a better citizen.

14:48.973 --> 14:51.692

Everybody there shooting, smoking.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.528
-You stay around here all day?
-Turning, turning around.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.525
Keep my face to the sun.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.730
Just pay attention to me.
Look at this picture.

You know this kid?

15:07.453 --> 15:10.126
He work around here.
Across the street.

15:10.373 --> 15:15.493
-You mean down the block?
-No. He sold 9 bags in that hallway.

15:15.733 --> 15:19.203
Don't sell him down
to make yourself look good.

15:19.453 --> 15:22.490
Okay, sure. What you say, l believe it.

15:22.693 --> 15:24.684
l don't recognize the guy.

-Clean him up, cut his hair.

He got a girlfriend too. She lives

-Got a warrant?
-Open up or l'll make this door a ramp.

16:03.293 --> 16:06.922
Don't break it. There's nothing

16:11.293 --> 16:13.488
You got no warrant.

16:13.653 --> 16:16.042
l must have lost it. Where's Lenny?

16:18.493 --> 16:22.327
You mean you did all this
cha-cha stuff just to find Lenny?

16:22.493 --> 16:27.203
-You must not be too bright.
-l can spell soap. Can you? ls this him?

16:27.933 --> 16:31.130
Once. He hasn't looked
that good for a long time.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.893
l want to know where he is.

16:34.053 --> 16:35.771
Where you guys put him.

16:37.573 --> 16:38.926
Rikers.

16:39.733 --> 16:44.932
He got busted two weeks ago for a
stickup. Prick owed me $85.

16:45.173 --> 16:48.609
l got that for you,
but you gotta tell me something.

16:48.853 --> 16:53.529
l'm not asking you to give him up.
lf l was looking to cop from Lenny. . .

16:53.693 --> 16:57.811
. . .if l knew he dealt coke,
where would l go to score?

16:57.973 --> 17:01.249
Over on Grove, 1 840.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.484
That's the $85 answer.

17:04.532 --> 17:07.001
He was screwing the super's daughter.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.685
You're sure? Definite lD?

17:10.933 --> 17:15.608
No, we were working on another
case. We found him by accident.

17:15.853 --> 17:18.127
Tell the M.E. thanks
for getting back to me.

17:18.373 --> 17:20.489
Right. Thanks.

17:20.693 --> 17:24.571
So it's Maurice Taub.
M.E. got it off the prints.

17:24.733 --> 17:27.406
-How'd he die?
-lffy on the decomposition.

17:27.573 --> 17:31.009
They're talking strangulation.
Gotta do the toxicology.

17:31.173 --> 17:36.088
-lt's gonna be a lot of heat.
-Yeah, big shot found in a TV crate.

17:36.293 --> 17:39.285
-Andy still got that situation?
-For a little while.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.690
-You mind talking to the Taub widow?
-No problem.

17:42.893 --> 17:46.568
l talked to Medavoy and Martinez.
No luck on the original body.

17:46.773 --> 17:48.525
l feel bad for them.
They're still over in the dump.

17:48.773 --> 17:51.082
-You wanna go back?
-l'd love to. . .

17:51.253 --> 17:53.972
. . .but l gotta talk to this woman.

17:57.533 --> 17:58.522
-John.
-Yeah?

17:58.773 --> 18:00.843
-Burn that bag.
-lt's going.

18:01.053 --> 18:03.203
Detective? That's Seymour Gould.

18:03.453 --> 18:04.488
Hi, Mr. Gould.

18:05.773 --> 18:08.890
-l got your message.
-l'm sure you're very busy.

18:09.053 --> 18:13.490
-ls there someplace we can talk?
-ln the back. l got a few minutes.

18:17.453 --> 18:20.365
l was Jimmy Wexler's lawyer and manager.

18:20.533 --> 18:24.287
Yeah, l know. They nearly
held up the wedding for you.

18:24.533 --> 18:27.491
He had me in Singapore
negotiating a contract.

18:27.693 --> 18:30.605
l was in the Cayman lslands
when he died.

18:31.533 --> 18:34.969
Son of a bitch croaks
while l'm burying his money.

18:35.453 --> 18:38.889
So now l'm executing his will.
Read that.

18:44.973 --> 18:48.443
Whatever he asks, l'm supposed
to give you $ 1 000 a week. . .

18:48.613 --> 18:51.173
. . .for as long as you agree to do it.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.484
Well, what he asks me to do,
l'd do for nothing.

18:54.693 --> 18:58.049
Never admit you'd do
anything for nothing.

18:58.213 --> 19:00.681
How do you want
to receive the funds?

19:00.853 --> 19:04.323
Well, l need to speak to somebody
before l go ahead.

19:04.573 --> 19:07.883
-So can l get back to you on it?
-Okay.

19:09.973 --> 19:13.124
Hope Jimmy's not asking you
to kill anybody.

19:13.413 --> 19:17.292
Unless it's this guy we've been
dealing with in the Caymans.

19:17.853 --> 19:21.289
-See you.
-Yeah. Thanks for coming in.

19:38.533 --> 19:41.570
Mrs. Taub, l'm Detective John Kelly.

19:41.733 --> 19:45.806
-ls this news about Maurice?
-Could l come in, please?

19:48.053 --> 19:50.726
Come into the library.

19:55.373 --> 19:57.603
Won't you sit down?

20:01.853 --> 20:05.129
l wish there was another way
to say this to you. . .

20:05.333 --> 20:08.131
-. . .but we found your husband's body.
-My God.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.925
l'm sorry.

20:14.093 --> 20:16.004
Where did you find him?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.686
Staten lsland.

20:18.973 --> 20:24.764
-Maurice has never been to Staten lsland.
-We found him in a landfill out there.

20:29.013 --> 20:33.928
-How did he die?
-Well, it appears he's been strangled.

20:35.293 --> 20:38.490
l had hoped we'd find out
that he ran away.

20:38.733 --> 20:40.485
So did we.

20:40.693 --> 20:44.402
Even if that meant
he was unhappy with me.

20:46.253 --> 20:50.212
Do you have any suspects?

20:50.373 --> 20:54.969
Well, not yet. Do you feel
like you're up for talking about it?

20:56.293 --> 20:58.523
Okay. Did he have any enemies?

20:58.773 --> 21:01.685
Anything like that, personal feuds?

21:01.933 --> 21:02.922
No.

21:03.093 --> 21:05.812
Business associates,
anybody angry at him?

21:05.973 --> 21:09.488
lf this were not some
random act of street violence. . .

21:09.733 --> 21:15.524
. . .don't you think the criminal would
have asked for ransom or jewelry or art?

21:16.413 --> 21:20.725
Well, he disappeared in Central Park
while he was taking his walk.

21:20.973 --> 21:23.931
-Yes.
-Any special reason he'd go there?

21:25.053 --> 21:26.486
Why do you ask that?

21:26.693 --> 21:31.483
Well, l'm not trying to pry
into his sexual habits or preferences.

21:31.653 --> 21:34.725
lt's merely in regards to his death.

21:35.893 --> 21:39.488
As far as l know, my husband
had no sexual preferences.

21:39.693 --> 21:42.253
l suppose l could always be surprised.

21:44.973 --> 21:50.127
-Excuse me. l'll return later.
-No, no, this is Detective Kelly.

21:50.373 --> 21:52.284
Serge Deschanel.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.087
He's our concierge.

21:56.093 --> 21:59.563
They found Maurice.
He's been strangled.

22:02.133 --> 22:04.010
l'm so sorry.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.728
KELLY: You're the concierge?
-Correct.

22:07.293 --> 22:11.332
l'll need a list of service people
from the building here.

22:11.533 --> 22:15.651
-l'll have you come down to the station.
-l'm on duty now.

22:15.853 --> 22:18.526
-Please, Serge, cooperate.
-Of course.

22:18.733 --> 22:22.089
Mrs. Taub, again l am sorry.

22:22.293 --> 22:26.923
They'll inform you about the procedure
for your husband's remains.

22:27.173 --> 22:28.288
l'm sorry.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.605
My car's around the corner.

22:47.013 --> 22:48.810
Who are you?

22:51.973 --> 22:55.010
-My name is Sipowicz. l'm a cop.
-Go on.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.448
l wanna talk to you a few minutes.

22:57.613 --> 23:00.411
l got nothing to say to you.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.967
He looks like you, doesn't he?

23:12.253 --> 23:14.528
-Lucky him.
-He got nailed for you.

23:14.733 --> 23:18.646
-A John Doe warrant for selling coke.
-Maybe he sold it.

23:18.853 --> 23:23.165
Out of a hallway at 1 840 Grove?
That's your spot, Lenny.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.244
What's the point?

23:31.293 --> 23:33.363
He's my son.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.892
And?

23:37.093 --> 23:41.962
-l want you to cop to the drug sales.
-Cop to a felony? You're crazy.

23:42.133 --> 23:46.206
Take it. l'll get you a sentence concurrent
to what you're popped for.

23:46.453 --> 23:51.732
You won't do extra time, and
l'll let them know that you cooperated.

23:51.893 --> 23:54.123
lf you let my son get arraigned. . .

23:54.373 --> 24:00.084
. . .l'll make sure that you go separate
on every charge, three counts of sale.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.809
Why put me on the spot?
He could beat the case.

24:04.973 --> 24:07.487
-He'll have a B number.
-lt ain't a tattoo.

24:07.693 --> 24:09.331
lt might just as well be.

24:09.493 --> 24:13.691
Even off a dismissal, he's gonna
have that arrest number for life.

24:13.893 --> 24:18.683
Every time he's fingerprinted,
that number's gonna come up.

24:18.933 --> 24:24.963
He can tell people he's innocent, but the
file is sealed. They'll just think he beat it.

24:25.173 --> 24:29.291
Every time he files a loan or a
job application, they're gonna ask:

24:29.453 --> 24:33.571
''Have you ever been arrested?''
And he's gonna have to say yes.

24:38.813 --> 24:40.883
Give him a break.

24:48.853 --> 24:50.491
That's my lawyer.

24:51.053 --> 24:54.011
He says it's okay, then it's okay.

24:54.213 --> 24:58.889
l need you to tell the truth.
l need you to say you did it.

25:01.213 --> 25:06.924
lf my lawyer says it's okay,
l'll say l did it.

25:10.413 --> 25:12.165
On the gate.

25:30.133 --> 25:32.886
MARTlNEZ: What do you think?
Should we wrap it up?

25:33.133 --> 25:35.249
MEDAVOY:
No, l want to move in out here.

25:35.453 --> 25:39.162
l want to set up a tent right here
in section 6-7.

25:42.773 --> 25:45.731
Dirty, stinking, rotten birds.

25:51.333 --> 25:57.522
-How we doing on that service list?
-l finished that list half an hour ago.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.286
Sorry to hold you up.

26:00.813 --> 26:02.326
Let me ask you. . .

26:02.493 --> 26:07.692
. . .is there anything about those people
that might connect them with the death?

26:07.973 --> 26:10.282
-l'm sorry, no.
-Okay.

26:11.493 --> 26:16.965
ln a case like this, with no apparent
motive, anything you tell me can help.

26:18.253 --> 26:22.405
Mr. Taub's death is a mystery to me,
as well as yourself.

26:22.573 --> 26:27.522
ln Mrs. Taub's report, she said you
saw him leaving for his nightly walk.

26:27.773 --> 26:29.684
-Yes, about 9 p.m.
-Yeah.

26:31.573 --> 26:34.485
So you were the last person
to see him alive.

26:36.173 --> 26:38.448
Obviously not.

26:38.613 --> 26:42.765
The last person to see him that can help,
that we know of now.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.528
Can you be real specific
about him leaving the building?

26:48.773 --> 26:52.732
Unfortunately, we had the al-Fassis
arrive that evening.

26:52.973 --> 26:57.683
He's a Saudi prince, and it's quite
a project getting him settled.

26:57.853 --> 27:02.608
l was running between the lobby
and the 1 1 th floor. So was Roland.

27:02.773 --> 27:06.846
That's the doorman?
He didn't see Mr. Taub leaving?

27:07.053 --> 27:10.932
l don't blame him for
momentarily deserting his post.

27:11.093 --> 27:13.607
Al-Fassis is an extraordinary tipper.

27:13.773 --> 27:17.607
As for Mr. Taub leaving,
there was nothing distinctive.

27:17.813 --> 27:23.171
Know what strikes me as funny? How you
let yourself into Mrs. Taub's apartment.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.972
Yes, l have a master key.

27:26.133 --> 27:29.603
For many guests, l drop things off,
leave documents. . . .

27:29.853 --> 27:33.846
-And you help her that way too?
-Of course l help Mrs. Taub.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.691
She's my boss.

27:38.293 --> 27:42.764
So you knew she was home,
you didn't ring, you didn't knock. . .

27:42.933 --> 27:47.688
. . .you let yourself in. You guys
get along pretty well, don't you?

27:47.853 --> 27:49.730
She's a perfectionist.

27:49.933 --> 27:54.051
And l'm Swiss, and it's in our nature
to be perfectionists also.

27:54.253 --> 27:58.883
Have you ever noticed a 35-inch
television, a Triton, in the apartment?

27:59.053 --> 28:02.932
-Did you let yourself in to deliver that?
-l don't recall that.

28:03.133 --> 28:06.808
Mr. Taub's body was found
in a Triton television box.

28:06.973 --> 28:09.931
l wouldn't know about it. l'm sorry.

28:10.733 --> 28:13.327
-l'm gonna ask you to stick around.
-Why?

28:13.533 --> 28:15.808
Write up what happened that night. . .

28:15.973 --> 28:18.806
. . .al-Fassis, Mr. Taub
leaving the building.

28:18.973 --> 28:21.487
Something might jog your memory.

28:21.653 --> 28:26.010
l'm grateful for your help.
Hopefully it won't last much longer.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.045
What do you think?

28:38.653 --> 28:44.011
l don't know which one whacked him yet,
but they're both definitely involved.

28:44.173 --> 28:48.086
-This guy doesn't fluster too easy.
-That's his job.

28:48.773 --> 28:51.446
-What about bringing in the widow?
-l wanna do that.

28:51.613 --> 28:53.649
-Maybe shaking her up a little.
-Yeah.

28:53.853 --> 28:57.050
-Speak to Medavoy and Martinez?
-They're winding up.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.283
-No luck?
-No luck so far.

28:59.453 --> 29:00.806
They must be pissed.

29:08.813 --> 29:11.122
-l'm really sorry.
-lt happens.

29:11.373 --> 29:13.728
l gave too much credit
to the haircut.

29:13.973 --> 29:18.251
Your boy's got a haircut, and l adjusted
when l remembered the perp.

29:18.453 --> 29:22.685
We got another problem, though.
They took your boy to booking.

29:22.893 --> 29:26.329
-You said he'd stay here.
-l told the sergeant l'd take him. . .

29:26.493 --> 29:29.849
-. . .so he sends him.
-Son of a bitch. ls he printed?

29:30.013 --> 29:32.607
Yeah. The guy is a real hard-on.

29:32.853 --> 29:35.083
-Savino, state police.
-Thanks.

29:35.293 --> 29:38.490
-l'm on a special. . . .
-What about my kid?

29:38.733 --> 29:43.523
l'm trying to reach out
on his prints right now. Savino.

29:43.933 --> 29:46.003
Phil, could you do me a favor?

29:46.253 --> 29:49.484
l collared a kid. lt was the wrong collar.

29:49.733 --> 29:54.409
l'm trying to get the prints back
so he don't get a NYSllS number.

29:54.573 --> 29:58.248
No, just within the last half-hour
they would've come in.

29:58.773 --> 30:02.686
-l know, l know.
-What if they're smudged?

30:03.053 --> 30:06.409
Maybe they could get rejected
for quality.

30:06.573 --> 30:10.202
Maybe you could reach out,
ask for a reprint.

30:10.373 --> 30:15.003
No, by then l could get the arrest
voided down here. Right.

30:15.253 --> 30:16.732
Will you let me know?

30:16.973 --> 30:18.565
l appreciate it. Thanks, Phil.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.092
He's gonna see what he can do.

30:20.293 --> 30:22.727
-So he's gonna call you back?
-Yeah.

30:22.973 --> 30:26.568
-Are they bringing my son back?
-l asked.

30:26.733 --> 30:30.328
-When's my son getting back?
-This is Savino's case?

30:30.533 --> 30:34.321
-You sent him over with a bad lD.
-Wanna change that tone?

30:34.573 --> 30:36.928
He told you he was gonna take him over.

30:37.173 --> 30:40.882
This desk is run by the uniformed
force, not by the bureau.

30:41.093 --> 30:46.406
-l didn't make the wrong bust. Savino did.
-Why don't we wait in the squad room?

30:46.653 --> 30:50.965
You get my kid a NYSllS
to bust this guy's balls?

30:51.133 --> 30:54.523
-Take it easy.
MCCABE: Andy, it's going to be okay.

30:54.773 --> 30:57.333
-When's he getting back?
-On the next run.

30:57.493 --> 30:59.723
That's the last answer you get
till you change that tone.

30:59.933 --> 31:02.811
l want my son back. l want my son back.

31:03.053 --> 31:08.525
l'm busting my ass, you're dicking around.
l gotta do all my work for you guys?

31:18.733 --> 31:23.409
-They can take us right away.
-l gotta get back to do an interrogation.

31:23.653 --> 31:25.928
-No problem.
-All right?

31:28.093 --> 31:30.482
So you all packed?

31:30.693 --> 31:34.288
-Shorts, T-shirts and a bathing suit.
-Sounds good.

31:34.693 --> 31:38.288
We were digging in a garbage dump
all morning.
