WEBVTT

00:06.300 --> 00:07.865
We're lost!

00:07.886 --> 00:10.773
Not everything out here
is easily explained.

00:10.794 --> 00:12.419
Andy!

00:13.857 --> 00:16.455
We need to get Andy back
before anyone realises he's gone.

00:16.476 --> 00:20.031
- If we had Alice's Book Of Shadows...
- I threw out all that rubbish.

00:20.052 --> 00:22.009
- Why would we trust you?
- I want to help.

00:22.030 --> 00:24.156
With a spell that conjures
the missing element.

00:24.177 --> 00:26.870
Element of water -
find your power, take your form.

00:28.065 --> 00:29.802
- That's not Andy.
- How do you know?

00:29.849 --> 00:30.984
That's how!

00:31.005 --> 00:34.642
- Alice set us up.
- She wanted us to unleash that water demon.

00:34.663 --> 00:36.087
Is this what you want?

00:37.387 --> 00:40.188
- What are you guys doing in here?
- We can explain.

00:42.255 --> 00:43.475
So his friends were here.

00:43.496 --> 00:45.868
What's the bet he's just out being
a standard-issue teenager?

00:45.889 --> 00:46.874
Not my son.

00:46.895 --> 00:48.483
I just wish we could've
brought Andy back.

00:48.504 --> 00:50.990
- Where's Andy?
- What exactly is going on?

Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:40.897 --> 01:44.045
- Sam told you everything he knows.
- Why do you need to interview Jake?

01:44.066 --> 01:45.877
You don't seriously think
they've done something with Andy.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.353
It's out of my hands.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.421
Do you know what they've been
through these past few weeks?

01:49.442 --> 01:50.473
It's a missing person's...

01:50.494 --> 01:53.702
- So what do we do?
- We stick to our story, like we agreed.

01:53.723 --> 01:55.672
We need to get back to rescuing
Andy before things get...

01:55.693 --> 01:56.821
Any weirder.

01:56.842 --> 02:01.805
No, I'll brief the Chief Super myself
as soon as I've spoken to these boys.

02:01.868 --> 02:02.968
I will.

02:03.499 --> 02:05.372
Thank you very much.

02:05.742 --> 02:07.537
- Is that...?
- Forest Roland?

02:07.558 --> 02:11.339
No beard, a suit - he's not
Hermit Guy in this universe.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.403
It might not be so bad.
He was on our side.

02:14.424 --> 02:16.447
Yeah, until he tried to destroy us.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.981
Good point.

02:19.814 --> 02:22.498
- And then he runs into the bush?
- Yes.

02:22.519 --> 02:26.281
- And this is after you argued?
- I wouldn't call it an argument.

02:26.359 --> 02:29.363
- What would you call it?
- A misunderstanding.

02:29.384 --> 02:32.159
- What would you call it?
- A misunderstanding.

02:32.180 --> 02:34.191
About what?

02:34.492 --> 02:36.535
They liked the same girl.

02:36.536 --> 02:39.985
...Which is weird, 'cause
I don't see why she's so likable.

02:40.006 --> 02:43.739
- And they fought over her?
- It was more like a misunderstanding.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.248
Yeah, what a surprise.

02:45.269 --> 02:49.295
So there's a dispute over a girl,
er... Ellen.

02:50.657 --> 02:51.842
I guess.

02:52.340 --> 02:56.077
- Andy runs off, then what?
- We searched everywhere.

02:56.098 --> 02:59.004
- From the bush along the river...
- ...all the way to the national park.

02:59.025 --> 03:02.594
Yeah, so long story short,
Andy vanishes into what?

03:02.775 --> 03:07.459
- Thin air?
- I honestly don't know where Andy went.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.601
Whose idea was the home invasion?

03:12.626 --> 03:14.221
Excuse me?

03:14.222 --> 03:16.731
Well, it's not like we broke in.
We used the spare key.

03:16.752 --> 03:21.935
I'm sorry, so you were
trespassing because...?

03:22.756 --> 03:26.108
And at what point during
the ransacking of Andy's room

03:26.129 --> 03:28.336
did you realise
that he wasn't there?

03:28.357 --> 03:30.117
Well, I...

03:30.354 --> 03:31.471
I don't...

03:31.492 --> 03:35.200
Yes, we haven't rehearsed
this part of the story, have we?

03:39.548 --> 03:41.531
We just wanted to find him.

03:41.532 --> 03:44.857
Er, we thought it might help us
figure out where Andy went.

03:44.878 --> 03:47.562
Did you take something?
Did you put something back?

03:47.583 --> 03:49.431
- It's not like that!
- What is it like, Felix?

03:49.452 --> 03:50.834
We didn't do anything to Andy!

03:50.855 --> 03:53.230
- If you've asked all your questions...
- No, actually there's a few more.

03:53.251 --> 03:55.541
- I should take him back to school.
- Mrs Ferne!

03:55.562 --> 03:58.174
Your son
argued with Andy Lau

03:58.195 --> 04:02.381
just before Felix here, and his
friends, chased him into the bush.

04:02.402 --> 04:05.076
Andy hasn't been seen since.

04:05.504 --> 04:08.512
What do you expect us to think?

04:09.353 --> 04:10.983
Let's go.

04:16.115 --> 04:18.517
I'm absolutely fuming!

04:18.539 --> 04:21.742
- What do we do, get lawyers?
- It won't come to that, surely.

04:21.954 --> 04:23.463
How full on was that?

04:23.484 --> 04:26.983
- This Roland is no fun at all.
- Why is this Roland so different?

04:27.004 --> 04:29.898
We get grilled by a detective
that thinks we did something to Andy

04:29.919 --> 04:31.445
and that's what you guys
are worried about that?!

04:31.466 --> 04:33.789
This Roland should be the same
as the one in the forest!

04:33.810 --> 04:35.647
Maybe it's a chicken thing!

04:35.730 --> 04:39.529
The Henriettas, remember? Raising
chickens is supposed to be very calming.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.085
This Roland could use some calming.

04:41.105 --> 04:44.309
We're the only thing that's supposed
to be different in these two universes.

04:44.330 --> 04:45.519
Doesn't add up.

04:45.520 --> 04:49.510
What does this have to do with Andy?
We need to get the police off our backs!

04:49.531 --> 04:52.291
- We get Andy back.
- You say that like it's actually possible.

04:52.312 --> 04:55.051
Alice. She tricked us
into making that water demon.

04:55.072 --> 04:56.488
She knows what happened to him.

04:56.509 --> 04:59.047
Boys! Why did the police
want to speak to you?

04:59.068 --> 05:02.075
- Who does she think she is?
- Did you do something to Andy Lau?

05:02.096 --> 05:05.095
- They haven't done anything.
- And they've got nothing to say.

05:05.116 --> 05:08.014
What's the connection between Andy
vanishing and you all getting lost?

05:08.035 --> 05:09.474
Why don't you get lost?

05:09.495 --> 05:13.205
This latest disappearance comes
just days after the Bremin Four

05:13.226 --> 05:18.103
emerged mysteriously unscathed
after being lost in a nearby forest.

05:18.124 --> 05:22.342
Police are refusing to comment
on any link between the two events,

05:22.363 --> 05:27.254
but the remaining boys are now thought to
be suspects in Andy Lau's disappearance.

05:27.275 --> 05:30.050
- Have you got anything to hide?
- This is harassment!

05:30.071 --> 05:31.412
Don't say anything.

05:31.433 --> 05:34.671
Earlier today, the Lau family
made an emotional plea.

05:34.692 --> 05:37.939
If you have any information,
please contact the police.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.201
We just want our son back.

05:43.246 --> 05:45.258
Think like Phoebe...

06:02.171 --> 06:04.171
That's a start!

06:12.274 --> 06:15.082
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

06:15.262 --> 06:17.578
I just had the TV on.

06:17.635 --> 06:20.363
That poor kid,
I really feel for his family.

06:20.384 --> 06:22.276
Who'd wanna go through that?

06:23.846 --> 06:27.842
You know, I might be able to help...
if I had my book.

06:28.916 --> 06:30.700
Aren't you the good Samaritan!

06:31.964 --> 06:35.294
You're right,
we should stay out of it.

06:35.315 --> 06:37.409
I'm sure that kid will turn up.

06:37.502 --> 06:39.842
Did you get the registration papers?

06:39.898 --> 06:42.886
Can't get the van on the road
without them.

06:56.804 --> 06:58.532
Not so fast.

07:02.220 --> 07:04.290
- Happy?
- I need to know you're OK.

07:04.311 --> 07:07.245
- It's been a big few weeks.
- I should catch up with the guys.

07:07.266 --> 07:10.691
I'm worried! I've barely heard
a peep out of you. It's not my Sam.

07:10.728 --> 07:15.220
I don't get it: first, I talk too much, and
now I don't blab not enough; I can't win.

07:15.339 --> 07:17.317
If you're not
comfortable talking to me...

07:17.338 --> 07:20.328
All I need is a bit of 'normal'.
Promise.

07:20.349 --> 07:23.297
I could organise a time with the
school counsellor, if it would help.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.994
Mr North? No.
Honestly, I'm good.

07:27.015 --> 07:29.680
What are you ashamed of, sweetheart?
Nobody'd even have to know.

07:29.701 --> 07:32.089
I said I'm fine!
I have to go.

07:36.593 --> 07:39.552
Now, straight home from school.
No dilly-dallying.

07:39.573 --> 07:42.433
Dilly-dallying?
What does that even mean?

07:42.481 --> 07:47.646
You too, Jake. We're gonna have a nice chat
about boundaries and other people's houses.

07:47.647 --> 07:49.674
Yeah, well, we're really late, so...

07:49.675 --> 07:54.164
Boys! First day back.
Looking forward to getting stuck in?

07:54.185 --> 07:55.659
- Yeah.
- So much...

07:55.999 --> 07:58.316
How did it go with the police, OK?

07:58.353 --> 08:01.184
- I'm glad it's over.
- I'll bet. It must be a relief.

08:01.205 --> 08:02.460
So unnecessary.

08:02.481 --> 08:05.059
- OK. Bye, Mum.
- See you, love.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.970
You're telling me!

08:08.548 --> 08:10.134
I feel your pain.

08:10.155 --> 08:12.658
Mention it again
and you'll feel my fist.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.679
He is really taking it well.

08:16.366 --> 08:18.806
We need to get to Alice's
without being seen.

08:18.827 --> 08:20.671
Easy, everyone's in class.

08:24.911 --> 08:27.298
Oi, what'd you do to the nerd?

08:27.319 --> 08:30.854
- I'm innocent, Your Honour!
- Which one of your loser friends is next?

08:34.198 --> 08:36.019
So much for a low-key departure.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.058
Who thought celebrity
would be such a drag?

08:38.059 --> 08:41.720
We can't leave now.
Everyone's watching us.

08:43.828 --> 08:45.315
We could go to class.

08:45.336 --> 08:47.757
I could finish that English assignment
with Mia, like I said I would.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.238
We don't have time for class!

08:49.259 --> 08:52.429
Dude! You're making it so hard
for me to make things up to her.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.109
She didn't even
return my calls last night.

08:54.130 --> 08:57.657
Wow... Your life must be so hard.
I might cry for you.

08:57.785 --> 08:59.558
Where's your girlfriend?

08:59.579 --> 09:02.309
- Oh, that's right: you don't have one.
- Come on.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.431
- Mr North...
- Sam Conte, it is your lucky day.

09:07.452 --> 09:11.091
- Is it? Is it really?
- I can fit you in this afternoon.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.601
Sorry?

09:12.622 --> 09:15.416
Your mum reached out.
My office, lesson five.

09:17.362 --> 09:21.308
What a nightmare. He's gonna
want me to talk about my feelings.

09:21.336 --> 09:22.908
And I don't wanna talk
about my feelings.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.085
- I don't even want to have feelings!
- Don't tell him anything.

09:26.106 --> 09:28.952
No-one's looking.
Can we just go?

09:31.677 --> 09:33.438
There she is.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.553
Where is he?

09:35.752 --> 09:38.882
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Where's Andy?

09:38.903 --> 09:41.927
- He's not home?
- No, funny about that.

09:41.969 --> 09:44.600
- What's going on?
- That's what we wanna know.

09:44.621 --> 09:46.984
- Didn't you try the spell?
- You set us up!

09:47.031 --> 09:48.508
What are you talking about?

09:48.529 --> 09:50.726
The spell you gave us
summoned a water demon.

09:50.747 --> 09:52.472
It... What?!

09:52.771 --> 09:54.275
You must not have done it right.

09:54.296 --> 09:56.550
Well, show me your book then.
Show me the spell.

09:56.571 --> 09:58.341
I don't have it.

09:59.002 --> 10:01.025
I can't do any magic without it.

10:01.781 --> 10:03.136
Which means...

10:03.157 --> 10:04.677
What's going on?
Are you alright?

10:04.698 --> 10:07.057
Your sister sabotaged our spell
to bring Andy home.

10:07.078 --> 10:08.734
Felix, maybe you got it wrong.

10:08.755 --> 10:11.301
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- It wasn't my fault!

10:11.322 --> 10:15.361
- You have to tell us where Andy is!
- She doesn't have to do anything, creepy!

10:15.542 --> 10:18.855
My sister doesn't do magic anymore,
so we can't help you.

10:18.876 --> 10:20.105
Goodbye.

10:20.126 --> 10:22.572
- You know something.
- OK, not loving this attitude.

10:22.593 --> 10:26.314
You're lying! I just want the truth.
Why won't you tell me?

10:26.335 --> 10:28.399
Argh, his hands are boiling hot!

10:30.208 --> 10:31.926
Whoa, dude!

10:32.014 --> 10:33.959
How are you doing that?

10:34.341 --> 10:35.876
Felix, get a grip!

10:35.897 --> 10:37.856
- I'm trying!
- Dude!

10:45.849 --> 10:48.777
I don't understand.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

10:51.174 --> 10:52.838
It's out. It's OK.

10:52.859 --> 10:55.375
Get him out of here. Pronto!

10:55.396 --> 10:56.737
Felix.

11:04.293 --> 11:06.799
- That was bad, Felix.
- Someone could have got hurt.

11:06.820 --> 11:09.618
You think I don't know that?
It's not like I meant for it to happen.

11:09.639 --> 11:12.239
Any chance of Phoebe and Alice helping us
has just gone up in smoke.

11:12.260 --> 11:15.260
It could happen to any of us!
The earthquake, anyone?

11:17.744 --> 11:20.731
Alice IS responsible
for what happened to Andy.

11:20.752 --> 11:24.141
- She has to be.
- Maybe another spell went wrong.

11:24.162 --> 11:26.075
Maybe that's got
nothing to do with Alice.

11:26.096 --> 11:28.157
Yeah, she doesn't scream
evil supervillain to me.

11:28.178 --> 11:30.468
It was her!
I didn't do anything wrong.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.671
Dude! That Water Andy
was all kinds of wrong!

11:32.698 --> 11:34.388
It was her magic!

11:35.289 --> 11:38.239
Her incredibly powerful magic.

11:38.753 --> 11:40.185
If we had her Book Of Shadows...

11:40.206 --> 11:43.424
- She said she doesn't have it.
- She wants it, though. I could see that.

11:43.445 --> 11:47.435
You think Phoebe threw it out,
with all the other magic shop stuff?

11:47.456 --> 11:51.369
- Great, so it could be anywhere.
- There are hundreds of spells in it.

11:51.390 --> 11:55.948
- Serious magic. It's our only chance.
- But where would we even start to look?

11:57.126 --> 11:59.608
Maybe Oscar's power can help.

12:00.859 --> 12:05.120
Now, don't be nervous. We're talking
to everyone that knows Andy.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.132
I'm not nervous.

12:07.202 --> 12:10.213
Did Felix ever argue
with his brother?

12:10.461 --> 12:12.073
Not really.

12:12.094 --> 12:15.248
How did Oscar's accident happen?

12:15.984 --> 12:18.947
They were climbing a tree.
Oscar fell.

12:18.968 --> 12:23.192
Felix was up the tree with him,
but he didn't fall.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.706
- No.
- I see.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.416
What are you saying?

12:27.672 --> 12:30.650
Because Felix didn't
do anything to Oscar or Andy.

12:30.671 --> 12:32.808
They spent half of yesterday
looking for him.

12:32.829 --> 12:33.985
You know that for a fact?

12:34.006 --> 12:37.125
- What else would they have been doing?
- You tell me.

12:38.416 --> 12:41.271
Ellen, if you know something,
you should say so.

12:41.925 --> 12:43.592
Ellen...

12:43.805 --> 12:45.796
There was a 'thing'.

12:45.985 --> 12:47.985
A thing...?

12:48.954 --> 12:53.450
They had this 'thing' they had to do.
They wouldn't say what.

13:04.269 --> 13:05.982
Murphy.

13:07.151 --> 13:10.363
- Ellen, you seen Oscar?
- Not since before lunch.

13:10.384 --> 13:13.098
- Did you hear?
- They found Andy in Rochford.

13:13.119 --> 13:15.682
- What?
- Someone phoned in a sighting.

13:15.703 --> 13:17.171
Is that possible?

13:17.625 --> 13:20.154
Let's hope so.
We should get to class.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.268
- Felix, I need to talk to you.
- Later, OK?

13:22.289 --> 13:24.292
Again with the 'later'?

13:24.387 --> 13:28.414
- I'm sorry, I can explain.
- Can you? Like, right now?

13:28.657 --> 13:30.510
Not right now.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.496
Didn't think so.

13:33.668 --> 13:35.659
Do you really think
they found Andy in Rochford?

13:35.680 --> 13:37.894
- Not a chance.
- Well, if somebody saw him...

13:37.915 --> 13:39.982
A magic storm
sucks Andy up into the sky

13:40.003 --> 13:43.517
and deposits him into a lame tourist town?
I don't think so.

13:43.774 --> 13:47.982
- The skip, outside the magic shop.
- What, you think Andy's there?

13:48.054 --> 13:50.862
If Phoebe threw Alice's book out,
that's where it would be.

13:50.883 --> 13:52.150
Can it be that easy?

13:52.171 --> 13:54.090
I was starting to think
you were a no-show.

13:54.111 --> 13:55.527
Mr North.

13:56.131 --> 13:58.279
- Not a word.
- Come on.

14:01.304 --> 14:04.303
Well, there's no chance
of getting this thing to flower.

14:04.324 --> 14:08.200
- They're just kids.
- Kids with freaky, uncontrollable powers.

14:08.221 --> 14:09.891
How did Felix do that?

14:09.912 --> 14:12.798
- In all those years studying magic...
- It's not magic...

14:12.819 --> 14:14.699
It's something else.

14:14.968 --> 14:16.531
How do you know?

14:16.632 --> 14:19.627
I don't... not for sure.

14:20.635 --> 14:22.463
Maybe I could find out
if I had my Book...

14:22.484 --> 14:25.630
Book Of Shadows? No way.

14:27.842 --> 14:29.578
You took it.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.003
We're better off without it.

14:32.024 --> 14:33.805
That's where you were
when I got back, isn't it?

14:33.826 --> 14:36.232
With you and magic,
it's all or nothing!

14:36.306 --> 14:38.819
And you're making sure it's nothing.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.637
I could keep us safe!

14:40.658 --> 14:43.447
- I could do lots of things.
- That's the problem.

14:43.468 --> 14:47.290
- You had no right to take it!
- You're not getting it back, Alice!

14:52.017 --> 14:55.044
Now, first thing to know -
this is a safe place.

14:55.065 --> 14:56.996
- Second thing...
- Look.

14:57.017 --> 14:59.156
Only people with problems
need counselling...

14:59.188 --> 15:02.606
Second thing to know -
getting started is the hardest part.

15:02.727 --> 15:05.124
...And I don't have problems, so...

15:05.145 --> 15:07.773
Then why is your mum
so worried about you?

15:08.319 --> 15:11.639
- I don't know, you'd have to ask her.
- Huh, I'm asking you.

15:11.716 --> 15:14.967
- Well, she worries too much.
- Because...?

15:18.785 --> 15:22.517
Because of what you've been through?
Getting lost...?

15:23.282 --> 15:25.370
Andy going missing...?

15:26.395 --> 15:28.566
A police investigation...?

15:31.823 --> 15:33.802
What do you think, Sam?

15:33.834 --> 15:37.413
The best way of dealing with the
tough stuff is to talk about it.

15:44.265 --> 15:47.731
It was right here!
This is not happening.

15:47.752 --> 15:51.851
- No bins, no Book of Shadows.
- I'm not getting anything.

15:51.872 --> 15:55.827
Maybe if we got close to Alice and I made a
connection, I could sense where her book is.

15:55.839 --> 15:57.971
- Like a magical sniffer dog?
- Yeah, sort of.

15:57.992 --> 16:01.395
- We don't know if that's how it works.
- It could help, though.

16:01.416 --> 16:05.761
Alice is dangerous, you have to
stay away from her. Promise me!

16:06.271 --> 16:08.486
Fine, I will.

16:10.376 --> 16:12.821
You should go back to school.

16:12.842 --> 16:15.608
- I can help.
- You've done heaps already, Oskie.

16:15.634 --> 16:18.007
There's no point
you getting in trouble as well.

16:18.028 --> 16:21.028
Sure, let me know
if you find anything.

16:23.058 --> 16:26.286
- Any ideas?
- None.

16:27.493 --> 16:29.525
You've gotta be kidding me.

16:37.469 --> 16:39.346
Mia, hey.

16:39.733 --> 16:43.037
- I've been looking for you.
- Here I am.

16:43.122 --> 16:47.855
I just wanted to say that
I wasn't myself at the party.

16:47.876 --> 16:53.217
Really? Secretive, jealous, unavailable...
That's just the new you, is it?

16:53.275 --> 16:55.234
Give me another chance?

16:55.441 --> 16:58.288
- I...
- No, you're right.

16:58.441 --> 17:03.257
I was all of those things,
and you're not.

17:03.258 --> 17:09.077
You're kind, you're sweet,
and you believe the best in people.

17:09.260 --> 17:13.789
- I promise that when we find Andy...
- I thought the police found him?

17:13.998 --> 17:18.005
- Um, yeah, well...
- They haven't?

17:24.631 --> 17:27.377
Felix, what's up?

17:29.220 --> 17:30.962
OK.

17:32.976 --> 17:35.117
- Sorry.
- It's fine, really.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.174
- I have to go.
- Go.

17:42.563 --> 17:47.343
So here we are... Two girls who
don't believe in chasing after guys...

17:47.364 --> 17:49.286
Watching the guys run off.

17:49.307 --> 17:51.388
I don't think they think
Andy's in Rochford.

17:51.409 --> 17:54.813
- Really?
- The boys know something.

17:54.834 --> 18:00.073
If they're not telling us something,
we'll just have to find out for ourselves.

18:01.530 --> 18:04.505
I want every available
Rochford car on the street

18:04.526 --> 18:08.048
to be looking out for an Andy Lau,
and find who's called this in.

18:08.069 --> 18:10.785
- ...Join the thin blue line.
- What are you doing?

18:10.834 --> 18:13.590
The kids asked me to do
a talk for Careers Day.

18:13.610 --> 18:17.241
- Did they?
- Yeah, they really admire the police force.

18:17.262 --> 18:20.571
They wanna hear
all about enforcing road rules...

18:21.214 --> 18:24.249
...And parking violations.

18:25.344 --> 18:27.626
They're pulling my leg, aren't they?

18:27.856 --> 18:30.915
Seems like a distinct possibility.

18:31.048 --> 18:35.660
Pull these boys out of class.
Let's see how they react to this news.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.084
That might be tricky.

18:38.841 --> 18:41.955
- Why?
- Well, they're not in class.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.946
The teacher said
they never showed up.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.911
And you didn't think
to mention this earlier?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.475
There was...

18:50.496 --> 18:54.042
You know what, Rochford can wait.
Come on.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.007
Bins? Again? Really?

19:00.008 --> 19:02.283
At least we're
not looking for food this time.

19:02.304 --> 19:03.513
How was Mr North?

19:03.534 --> 19:07.481
He wants me to release my emotions
using hydrotherapy.

19:08.565 --> 19:13.737
Oh, wait. No. What's the one
where 'you're getting sleepy'...?

19:13.758 --> 19:16.015
- Hypnotherapy?
- Bingo.

19:16.036 --> 19:17.987
Sounds awesome, right?

19:17.988 --> 19:21.566
Your subconscious spilling the beans
is not awesome, Sam.

19:23.147 --> 19:25.174
So, what, we just dive in?

19:25.175 --> 19:27.154
Unless you've got a better idea.

19:27.155 --> 19:31.111
This rescuing Andy stuff just keeps
getting better and better.

19:34.123 --> 19:36.150
It stinks in here.

19:43.191 --> 19:47.155
I knew sticking around here
was the right thing to do.

20:16.195 --> 20:20.143
Why'd they come here?
They're not dumping anything.

20:22.135 --> 20:24.154
Maybe they're shifting something.

20:24.155 --> 20:28.115
Something they didn't hide
well enough last time they were here.

20:40.627 --> 20:43.219
Randomly touching
other people's houses.

20:44.659 --> 20:47.155
Some people might think
that's a bit odd.

20:47.282 --> 20:50.329
- I was just...
- You're Felix's brother, aren't you?

20:50.421 --> 20:53.006
- Look, I should leave.
- That's OK, you can...

20:59.238 --> 21:00.746
What was that?

21:01.104 --> 21:02.747
I've gotta go.

21:09.413 --> 21:12.679
What's to bet that it's right at the
bottom where all the bin juice is?

21:13.006 --> 21:17.013
Guys, guys, what we really need
is an extra pair of hands.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.372
Just keep looking.

21:20.373 --> 21:22.956
Ever thought of doing comedy?
You are really funny.

21:43.433 --> 21:46.384
Elements, reveal and show

21:46.385 --> 21:49.679
what I seek, what I must know.

22:08.735 --> 22:10.534
Oh, no...

22:13.736 --> 22:15.397
My book!

22:27.131 --> 22:29.884
And the trace confirms
that the call originated in Bremin?

22:29.966 --> 22:31.878
- Sergeant...
- Yeah. Wait.

22:33.168 --> 22:34.882
So no sign of Andy at all?

22:34.903 --> 22:36.357
- Something's happening.
- Shh.

22:36.382 --> 22:38.235
This call was a hoax.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.009
Thank you.

22:41.116 --> 22:42.990
Right, come on.

22:43.156 --> 22:46.250
- I gotta get to the station.
- What are you doing?

22:46.879 --> 22:48.119
New lead.

22:48.140 --> 22:50.156
- We gotta go, we gotta go!
- What's going on?

22:50.177 --> 22:53.147
Oscar knows where Alice's book
is and Alice does too. Come on!

22:57.183 --> 23:00.967
- Are you sure you know where this is?
- Trust me, it's this way.

23:01.050 --> 23:02.927
We have to find this lake.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.924
You do the magic
and we'll do the orienteering.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.560
- We're close!
- We need to move faster, come on.

23:12.687 --> 23:14.699
Oh, wait up!

23:21.376 --> 23:23.210
- There it is.
- Awesome!

23:23.231 --> 23:24.556
I told you.

23:29.638 --> 23:33.155
We need to find this tree.
Look for freshly-dug soil underneath.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.671
Over here.

23:48.850 --> 23:52.646
- Alice beat us to it.
- Now, this is bad.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.723
Really, really bad.

24:02.647 --> 24:05.231
Any chance of us getting Andy back
disappeared with that book.

24:05.252 --> 24:08.131
If we had a real water element,
we could do a tracking spell.

24:08.152 --> 24:09.406
There's another water element?

24:09.427 --> 24:11.778
Possibly. You weren't
the only ones with potential.

24:11.799 --> 24:15.809
We know it was you, Felix. We traced
the call from the exchange to here.

24:16.282 --> 24:19.937
Long story short, I'll find out
exactly what happened to Andy.

24:20.050 --> 24:22.839
I found them
in Andy's internet history.

24:25.469 --> 24:27.898
This could form a major part
of the police investigation.

24:27.919 --> 24:31.572
- No, we're not dobbing them into the cops.
- The police might be able to help.

24:31.593 --> 24:33.912
When I was lost, in the forest,
I thought about you.

24:34.051 --> 24:36.042
So, um, are you new?

24:36.087 --> 24:39.226
Either you tell me now, or I don't
think we can be together anymore.

24:39.247 --> 24:41.364
Can you make a spell that
makes me immune to hypnotism?

24:41.385 --> 24:42.568
One.

24:42.971 --> 24:45.981
- Can you remember the forest?
- Yes.

24:46.476 --> 24:47.576
Good.
