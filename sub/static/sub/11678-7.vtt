- Cops came later, man.

Oh, you know, Diego's right, of course.

Militaryfirebombs are typically...

29:57.250 --> 29:58.911
white phosphorus
or chlorine trifluoride.

29:58.986 --> 30:00.920
These are remarkably effective...

30:00.988 --> 30:03.388
but they're also unstable,
lethally toxic...

30:03.457 --> 30:05.550
and hard to find
at the grocery store.

firebomb, on the other hand...
