00:39.094 --> 00:41.442
Have you been eating
the cookie dough again?

00:41.567 --> 00:43.096
Is there still some on my face?

00:43.221 --> 00:44.444
- No
- Then no.

00:44.569 --> 00:46.880
- We are going to the mall.
- It's a business trip...

00:47.005 --> 00:48.835
I'm gonna buy some beads
at the bead store

00:48.960 --> 00:50.508
and then open up my own.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.117
- Bye, Mom. Love you.
- Bye, honey. I love you too.

00:53.242 --> 00:54.804
- Bye, Dad. Love you.
- Okay.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.962
Stan, she's your daughter...

00:59.087 --> 01:01.069
why can't you ever say "I love you"?

01:01.194 --> 01:03.101
I can, I can.
But look,

01:03.226 --> 01:06.498
say she gets cancer, right?
And doctors can't cure it.

01:06.623 --> 01:09.781
She hears "I love you" from her dad
for the first time, and then bam,

01:09.906 --> 01:11.111
she dies happy.

01:13.538 --> 01:15.889
Once again, CIA body doubles

01:16.014 --> 01:18.092
are for work purposes only, people.

01:18.217 --> 01:20.346
Using your double
to finish making love

01:20.471 --> 01:22.992
to a JetBlue stewardess
because you were too drunk

01:23.117 --> 01:24.732
is a definite no-no...

01:24.946 --> 01:26.370
Sanders.

01:26.826 --> 01:29.048
Did you blab?
Why did you tell people?

01:29.173 --> 01:31.340
Come on, it was
my first sloppy seconds.

01:34.753 --> 01:37.474
- Hello?
- Stan! Hayley and Jeff broke up!

01:37.599 --> 01:39.970
So? She breaks up with Jeff
at least every other week.

01:40.095 --> 01:43.564
You don't understand.
This time, he broke up with her.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.619
Mr. S!

01:52.107 --> 01:55.038
Jeff, are you nuts?
Why did you break up with Hayley?

01:55.163 --> 01:57.857
I don't know,
it wasn't just one thing, Mr. S.

01:57.982 --> 02:00.171
It was, like... two things.

02:00.296 --> 02:01.871
But why'd she go so crazy?

02:02.040 --> 02:04.646
Whenever she gets dumped,
she completely wigs out.

02:04.771 --> 02:06.733
I don't know why,
but it's always been that way.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.819
Class, we have a new student
joing us today.

02:13.976 --> 02:16.827
This is Lynne.
Look how cute she is.

02:16.952 --> 02:19.346
And new. You know,
which is always appealing.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.745
The autopsy showed
the hamster was pregnant.

02:57.381 --> 02:59.804
- How come we're doing this?
- Why? Aren't you having fun?

03:15.342 --> 03:16.900
Oh, God!
Is she okay?

03:17.025 --> 03:19.435
She'll be fine...
just breathe her with this pump.

03:20.608 --> 03:22.728
The police said if Hayley
goes on another rampage,

03:22.853 --> 03:25.022
- they'll throw her in jail.
- Jail?

03:25.147 --> 03:26.840
She'll never survive!

03:26.965 --> 03:29.329
Tiny cells, the gangs,

03:29.454 --> 03:31.816
getting shanked in the cafeteria!

03:33.363 --> 03:35.439
The first couple stabs
break the skin,

03:35.564 --> 03:37.287
and then they really get in there!

03:38.983 --> 03:40.733
And my baby's all...

03:41.626 --> 03:44.539
"You bitch! I'll kill you!"

03:48.980 --> 03:50.968
That was a haunting scenelet,
Francine.

03:51.093 --> 03:52.508
And we can't prevent it.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.669
Hayley has horrible taste in men.

03:54.794 --> 03:56.652
She's gonna get
broken up with again.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.208
Which is why from here on out
she doesn't date anyone

03:59.333 --> 04:01.621
- I don't sign off on.
- I don't know, Stan,

04:01.746 --> 04:05.155
I think what she needs
right now is our love and support.

04:06.001 --> 04:08.329
Shoot her!
Shoot her in the face!

04:11.249 --> 04:12.766
I would've never come down here

04:12.891 --> 04:16.075
if you hadn't declared this
the "Summer of Exotic Adventure."

04:16.369 --> 04:17.531
Chinatown...

04:17.894 --> 04:20.434
where you could tell me
it was Japantown or Koreatown

04:20.559 --> 04:21.877
and I'd nod and smile.

04:22.002 --> 04:23.803
Check out the box of chickens!

04:23.973 --> 04:25.642
Hey, chicky, chicky.

04:25.767 --> 04:28.873
- Hey, little girl.
- How you know it female chick?

04:29.405 --> 04:30.827
Okay, well,

04:31.171 --> 04:32.725
it just looks like one.

04:33.644 --> 04:35.465
You right! Do again.

04:35.899 --> 04:38.708
This is a boy.
And this is a girl.

04:39.621 --> 04:41.860
Most people can't tell difference.

04:41.985 --> 04:44.248
You... you have gift!

04:44.476 --> 04:46.878
You work in my cousin's
chicken hatchery!

04:47.003 --> 04:48.828
My first summer job!

04:48.998 --> 04:52.692
Wait. Steve, what about our
"Summer of Exotic Adventure"?

04:52.817 --> 04:54.082
We'll do it together.

04:54.207 --> 04:57.004
And just like that
I'm working for the Chinese again.

05:00.821 --> 05:04.489
- I'll take a chai latte, please.
- Sweet. Just like you.

05:05.151 --> 05:06.376
- Name?
- Haley?

05:06.501 --> 05:09.462
- How about them digits?
- 757...

05:11.555 --> 05:13.019
Are you gonna marry my daughter?

05:13.245 --> 05:14.546
- What?
- Dad!

05:14.671 --> 05:16.579
I'm not gonna let you
date another loser

05:16.704 --> 05:19.427
who's gonna break up with you...
and this guy's a loser!

05:19.552 --> 05:22.217
Weak chin, small hands.
He'll dump you in a week.

05:22.342 --> 05:25.531
- I can date whoever I want.
- Actually, you can't.

05:27.073 --> 05:29.822
I can't let you freak out
and wind up in jail, Hayley.

05:29.947 --> 05:31.561
Your mother acted it out for me.

05:31.686 --> 05:34.748
It was riveting...
she took some very rewarding chances.

05:41.869 --> 05:44.796
Let's see, we have
a Romeo and a Juliet.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.984
Here's a Katie...
and this must be Tom.

05:49.109 --> 05:51.724
You're crazy!
Let her have a cell phone!

05:52.578 --> 05:54.955
There's nothing here.
No weiner, no wedge,

05:55.080 --> 05:57.133
just feathers and chicken skin.

05:57.258 --> 05:59.821
This summer isn't exotic, it sucks!

06:00.093 --> 06:02.653
Where's my beer?
Tsing Tao? Chilled glass?

06:02.778 --> 06:04.479
I know you can hear me, old man!

06:04.604 --> 06:06.501
World's worst waiter right here.

06:06.626 --> 06:09.867
Sir, I was wondering,
where do all these chickens go?

06:10.124 --> 06:11.939
Female go to farm, lay eggs.

06:12.064 --> 06:13.329
Male get culled.

06:13.646 --> 06:14.641
Culled?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.458
Yes, culled.

06:45.921 --> 06:47.616
So glamorous.

06:48.701 --> 06:49.621
Tsing Tao!

06:49.746 --> 06:53.429
At this rate, the beer is gonna come out
at the same time as the spring rolls.

06:53.554 --> 06:56.664
I know there are no spring rolls.
You're in a bit, and you're doing fine.

07:02.393 --> 07:03.671
There you are.

07:04.643 --> 07:06.969
Stay the hell out of my love life!

07:11.016 --> 07:13.657
Hayley told me
you've been airlifting men

07:13.782 --> 07:15.451
out of her life all week.

07:15.576 --> 07:17.825
I'm just trying to find her
someone reliable,

07:17.950 --> 07:19.625
someone good, someone...

07:19.750 --> 07:21.119
someone like me.

07:21.532 --> 07:23.293
Oh, forgot to feed Klaus.

07:24.837 --> 07:26.185
Stan, no!

07:26.310 --> 07:28.315
Klaus is having a blood test
in the morning.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.531
He's not supposed
to eat for 12 hours!

07:43.442 --> 07:45.540
Honey, you are a great kisser.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.016
Don't talk like that,
Bill, it's creepy.

07:48.141 --> 07:49.854
Shucks, I'm just kidding around,

07:49.979 --> 07:51.709
but my Stan Smith is dead-on.

07:51.834 --> 07:54.585
That's why I'm the best damn
body double at the CIA.

07:54.710 --> 07:57.902
Well, bring that body
over here... on the double.

08:00.482 --> 08:03.946
Francine tried to hide the cookie dough
in the washing machine, but I found it.

08:04.071 --> 08:05.317
I always find it.

08:05.932 --> 08:08.404
- Do I pause?
- Yeah, he's gonna sit down.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.946
Stan Smith!

08:10.957 --> 08:13.089
You bastard!
How could you?

08:13.214 --> 08:15.568
You caught me, but can you blame me?

08:15.693 --> 08:17.796
It's just so sweet and tempting.

08:18.183 --> 08:19.564
You're sick.

08:19.735 --> 08:22.813
- You should be in jail.
- Come on, you're overreacting.

08:22.938 --> 08:26.129
- Roger does it, too.
- I've stuck my fingers in there.

08:30.314 --> 08:32.618
Guess I'll go get some new popcorn.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.097
- You all know Bill, right?
- Hi, Stan, Francine.

08:37.565 --> 08:39.804
Wait, so that was Bill upstairs?

08:40.087 --> 08:42.261
You were just making out with a man

08:42.386 --> 08:44.686
who looks exactly like your father.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.090
I felt the same way at first.

08:49.995 --> 08:52.147
Stay the hell out of my love life!

08:53.272 --> 08:54.994
My dadgum <i>ni√ßoise</i>!

08:55.197 --> 08:57.604
<i>I dumped a salad on Bill,
thinking he was Dad.</i>

08:57.729 --> 08:59.875
<i>He was cool about it,
and we got to talking.</i>

09:00.000 --> 09:01.745
<i>Turned out we had a lot in common.</i>

09:02.622 --> 09:04.405
We went on a few dates, and now

09:04.530 --> 09:07.390
I don't even see the resemblance
to Dad anymore.

09:08.653 --> 09:10.496
Stan, do something!

09:12.000 --> 09:15.087
This is... fantastic.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.521
Why didn't I think of Bill
in the first place?

09:17.646 --> 09:19.263
He's a perfect specimen for her.

09:19.388 --> 09:23.263
Look at his powerful, devoted shoulders,
his strong, reliable chin,

09:23.388 --> 09:26.559
sculpted, rock-hard pecs,
pecs you could motorboat.

09:32.782 --> 09:35.728
Why does it stink so bad
on this side of the building?

09:35.853 --> 09:38.797
It does stink, boy,
on account of the slurry machine.

09:39.308 --> 09:41.275
After the male chicks are liquefied,

09:41.400 --> 09:43.749
they're processed into dog food
and chicken nuggets.

09:45.439 --> 09:47.727
Come on, boys,
we're getting you out of here.

09:47.852 --> 09:49.670
You thought they got top hats.

09:55.146 --> 09:57.243
Check out my ass on Bill.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.878
I'll catch up,
I just want to take a dip.

10:05.003 --> 10:06.604
I'll come with, handsome.

10:07.187 --> 10:09.568
Mom, I'm having
so much fun with Bill.

10:09.693 --> 10:14.220
- Yeah... he sure looks like your dad.
- I think he might be the one.

10:14.345 --> 10:16.450
If he dumped me,
I don't know what I would do.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.991
You'd be fine.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.500
No, I think I'd go maximum crazy.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.663
I'd murder Bill, burn down
the neighborhood, rape Roger...

10:24.357 --> 10:26.749
But that's not gonna happen.
We're... we're doing great.

10:26.874 --> 10:28.608
We're totally taking it slow.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.380
I mean, all we do is kiss.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.358
He is a great kisser.

10:35.276 --> 10:36.582
Get away! Shoo!

10:36.707 --> 10:38.598
This one's for the hermit crabs.

10:40.605 --> 10:43.246
Look at Hayley, Stan.
She's the greatest.

10:43.371 --> 10:45.697
- Real pretty, too.
- She's all right.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.604
You want to see something really hot,
check our her mama.

10:48.872 --> 10:50.273
Now, that's a woman.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.121
Bill, you ever pull it
in the great big blue?

10:53.504 --> 10:55.861
Hey, don't judge.
Wipe that look off my face.

10:58.343 --> 11:01.247
I hate these chickens.
Hate that one the most.

11:01.372 --> 11:02.868
Roger, don't be like that.

11:03.128 --> 11:04.912
Why not?
You've ruined everything.

11:05.199 --> 11:08.414
This was supposed to be
our summer of exotic adventure.

11:14.396 --> 11:16.289
Stan, I'm making dinner.

11:16.454 --> 11:19.371
Hanging out with Bill
has reminded me how sexy I am.

11:19.496 --> 11:21.681
I don't think now's the time...

11:23.602 --> 11:26.612
Wait, I got to put
the meat loaf in the oven first.

11:26.867 --> 11:29.460
You go upstairs
and sink-wash your boys.

11:33.842 --> 11:36.068
Bill.
Hayley's not home yet.

11:36.317 --> 11:38.921
- No, honey, it's me.
- Why were you outside?

11:39.046 --> 11:41.515
Shouldn't you be upstairs
getting ready for sex time?

11:41.640 --> 11:44.430
- On meat loaf night?
- Don't look at me like I'm crazy.

11:44.555 --> 11:46.757
We were just making out
in the kitchen.

11:46.965 --> 11:48.138
Making out?

11:48.263 --> 11:50.722
What are we, two 16-year-old girls?

11:53.459 --> 11:55.087
All right, baby, hop in and...

11:57.336 --> 11:59.996
Hey, there he is.
How's it going, big guy?

12:00.121 --> 12:02.615
- Bill, what the hell are you doing?
- This?

12:02.740 --> 12:05.108
When you were talking
about how hot your wife was,

12:05.233 --> 12:06.582
I realized you were right.

12:06.707 --> 12:09.521
So I decided to nail her
before I nailed your daughter.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.791
Guess you didn't know
old Bill likes to stir the pot.

12:13.681 --> 12:16.288
You ever come near
my family again, I'll kill you.

12:16.413 --> 12:19.105
- I guess we have to tell Hayley.
- Are you crazy?

12:19.273 --> 12:21.398
If you tell Hayley
that the love of her life

12:21.523 --> 12:24.177
tried to sleep with her mother,
she'll go on a rampage

12:24.302 --> 12:27.244
- and they'll lock her up.
- We'll just tell her he left.

12:27.493 --> 12:29.520
No. Because then she'll think

12:29.645 --> 12:31.950
- he dumped her...
- Go on a rampage.

12:32.075 --> 12:33.365
Have you guys seen Bill?

12:33.490 --> 12:35.481
We're supposed to go
on our romantic weekend,

12:35.606 --> 12:37.016
he's half an hour late.

12:37.508 --> 12:38.965
Do you think he's not coming?

12:39.183 --> 12:42.706
You better hope Bill shows up.
You don't even know.

12:46.135 --> 12:48.015
Why isn't he here!

12:49.400 --> 12:51.009
Hayley, listen,

12:51.359 --> 12:52.935
Mommy's terrified, but

12:53.060 --> 12:55.128
there is something you should know.

12:55.422 --> 12:56.463
Bill...

12:56.926 --> 12:58.281
Was stuck in traffic.

12:58.406 --> 13:00.190
Sorry, honeysuckle.
Ready to go?

13:00.315 --> 13:02.267
Bill, I'm so glad you're here.

13:02.392 --> 13:03.768
I'll go get my bag.

13:05.670 --> 13:08.225
- Stan?
- Yeah, pretty good impression?

13:08.350 --> 13:10.108
Watch, I also do a good Roger.

13:10.233 --> 13:12.000
I like wine.

13:14.072 --> 13:17.041
Don't worry, I've got it figured out.
I pretend to be Bill...

13:17.166 --> 13:19.222
act like a total jerk all weekend,

13:19.347 --> 13:21.097
and Hayley breaks up with me.

13:21.222 --> 13:23.080
No rampage, no jail.

13:23.205 --> 13:25.189
- Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.573
Have fu-fun, you two.

13:27.819 --> 13:29.636
Don't worry, we will.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.367
'Cause we're finally
going all the way.

13:33.492 --> 13:36.029
Doing it, doing it, do-do-doing it

13:36.200 --> 13:38.556
Should we break for lunch?
Nope, let's keep...

13:38.681 --> 13:41.128
Doing it, doing it
Someone's at the door.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.758
I don't care.
We're doing it, doing it

13:43.883 --> 13:47.383
Want to put on our hiking boots?
We'll wear 'em while we're...

13:47.508 --> 13:50.619
Doing it, I like the rhythm,
it is my method.

13:54.941 --> 13:58.450
You must think I'm a real jerk
having you carry all the bags.

13:58.575 --> 14:00.910
- I bet you want to break up with me.
- No way.

14:01.035 --> 14:04.758
I'm not into gender stereotypes.
And I love being treated as an equal.

14:05.228 --> 14:06.470
I changed my mind.

14:06.655 --> 14:08.678
Call me old-fashioned,
but I'm the man.

14:08.803 --> 14:11.474
- I'll handle the bags.
- That is so romantic.

14:12.462 --> 14:15.093
I'm not paying you back for gas.
Or the Doritos.

14:15.218 --> 14:17.535
I know I said we'd share,
so, here...

14:19.069 --> 14:20.716
Ugh, you're a pig.

14:20.934 --> 14:23.574
Let's see if you can
sniff out my truffle.

14:25.380 --> 14:28.116
I'm gonna go down to the gift shop.
See you at dinner.

14:29.638 --> 14:32.203
Hey, boys!
Time for your piano lesson.

14:33.284 --> 14:34.330
My God!

14:35.859 --> 14:37.837
Someone stole my roosters!

14:38.879 --> 14:41.795
"Roger Smith presents
Rooster Death Match 1.

14:42.037 --> 14:44.465
"Next time it's personal."

14:48.487 --> 14:50.862
Five dollars off
at the door with a flyer?

14:54.647 --> 14:56.691
I missed you all afternoon.

14:56.816 --> 14:59.066
You're really playing hard to get.

14:59.975 --> 15:03.439
- Check out that waitress. She is hot.
- What are you talking about?

15:03.564 --> 15:06.324
The waitress,
I'm checking her out, blatantly.

15:06.545 --> 15:10.075
If you dump me, do it sitting down,
so you don't block my view of her ass.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.420
I'd like to take her back to our room
and have sex with her on your clothes.

15:15.929 --> 15:18.177
- Let's ask her!
- What?

15:18.302 --> 15:20.102
You could do her,
then I could do you,

15:20.227 --> 15:22.503
then I'll take a turn with her
while you watch.

15:22.984 --> 15:25.214
You used to watch Sesame Street.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.360
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and take off my underwear,

15:28.485 --> 15:31.365
then you put our room key
in them and give them to her.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.580
The pie is really good.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.230
Are you famous for this?

15:46.362 --> 15:47.507
Glen!

15:52.915 --> 15:55.016
Don't worry, people,
plenty more action.

15:55.141 --> 15:57.587
This is Victor,
Glen's fraternal twin brother.

15:57.712 --> 16:01.136
He saw the whole thing.
Don't you think he wants revenge?

16:02.143 --> 16:04.420
Roger, you son of a bitch!

16:04.666 --> 16:07.506
I see you got the flyer.
Did you get the five dollars off?

16:07.737 --> 16:09.857
The offer was only valid
before 6:00!

16:09.982 --> 16:11.719
How could you do this
to my roosters?!

16:11.992 --> 16:14.473
You started it.
You took that stupid job

16:14.598 --> 16:16.678
and ruined our summer
of exotic adventure.

16:16.803 --> 16:18.792
- I'm taking my roosters home.
- You can't.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.880
These people paid good
money to see a fight,

16:21.005 --> 16:23.104
and you do not want
to piss them off.

16:23.229 --> 16:26.076
They want to see a fight?
How about we fight?

16:26.201 --> 16:28.987
For their freedom!
You want to see us fight?

16:35.504 --> 16:37.528
You and me, we go way back.

16:37.653 --> 16:39.222
I could never...

16:40.865 --> 16:42.249
I'll kill you!

16:55.915 --> 16:57.051
I give up.

16:57.176 --> 16:59.928
I'm sorry I took your chickens
for blood sport.

17:00.076 --> 17:01.353
You can have them back.

17:02.477 --> 17:03.482
Friends?

17:04.176 --> 17:05.189
Friends.

17:05.898 --> 17:08.867
No friends!
You must fight to the death!

17:09.086 --> 17:12.180
What is with you lately?
Everything is "to the death."

17:12.305 --> 17:13.468
Not everything.

17:13.593 --> 17:16.950
Two nights ago, we went out for pizza,
and you said, "Pizza to the death."

17:17.075 --> 17:18.933
I mean, what does that even mean?

17:19.058 --> 17:21.023
And remember, "Movies to the death"?

17:21.148 --> 17:24.054
- What's going on, man?
- I don't know.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.126
I don't like my job.

17:26.553 --> 17:28.980
Come on, guys.
Let's go home.

17:35.399 --> 17:37.112
Fellas!
Come back!

18:20.252 --> 18:22.057
Like in the movies, bitch!

18:24.202 --> 18:27.704
Bill, why aren't we back
at the room right now having sex?

18:27.912 --> 18:31.339
What, and miss out on Badger
Mountain's famous night hikes?

18:31.464 --> 18:33.975
Look out! Poisonous rock!
Into the bushes!

18:39.870 --> 18:42.243
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Francine, I did it!

18:42.368 --> 18:44.687
I ditched Hayley in the woods
and left her for dead.

18:44.812 --> 18:47.224
We won't have to worry
about her anymore.

18:47.349 --> 18:49.049
She's our daughter!

18:49.174 --> 18:51.405
You're supposed to be convincing her
to dump you,

18:51.530 --> 18:52.881
not killing her!

18:53.710 --> 18:55.905
Yeah, on some level, I knew that.

19:04.088 --> 19:06.477
- Bill? Bill?!
- Over here!

19:07.342 --> 19:09.490
Bill.
I thought you blew me off.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.792
I would have burned
this resort to the ground,

19:11.917 --> 19:13.950
just torched the whole forest
to cinders.

19:14.075 --> 19:16.785
But you didn't.
You didn't, and I love you.

19:19.216 --> 19:20.872
Well, I...

19:21.378 --> 19:24.312
You can't say it, can you?
You're just like my dad.

19:24.437 --> 19:26.288
What?
What do you mean?

19:26.610 --> 19:30.651
- My dad never says he loves me.
- But you know he does, right?

19:31.500 --> 19:33.680
That's crazy.
Of course he loves you.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.507
Just because he doesn't say it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

19:36.750 --> 19:37.999
Yeah, right.

19:38.662 --> 19:42.071
When you were a little girl,
he'd sneak into your room every night

19:42.196 --> 19:45.099
and put a hard candy in your mouth
so you'd have sweet dreams.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.384
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:47.509 --> 19:49.201
And every time
he leaves for a mission,

19:49.326 --> 19:52.305
he kisses the picture of you
he has on his desk for good luck.

19:52.430 --> 19:54.908
He loves you.
He loves you a ton.

19:55.125 --> 19:56.166
Trust me.

19:57.340 --> 19:58.822
How do you know all this stuff?

19:58.991 --> 20:01.652
I'm his double. I have to know
everything about his life.

20:01.777 --> 20:04.682
Gosh, Bill, thank you so much
for telling me all that.

20:04.807 --> 20:07.943
It means so much.
I got to call him.

20:08.068 --> 20:10.958
- You don't have to do that now.
- Yeah, I do.

20:12.152 --> 20:13.860
I'm breaking up with you!

20:15.704 --> 20:17.605
- Okay.
- Aren't you,

20:17.730 --> 20:20.803
aren't you gonna freak out
and go on a rampage?

20:21.513 --> 20:23.614
No, I guess not.

20:32.539 --> 20:33.495
Dad?

20:34.006 --> 20:35.113
Hello.

20:35.341 --> 20:37.076
Hey, Johnny, yeah.
It's work.

20:37.201 --> 20:39.735
Well, look in the book.
Is it a warehouse item?

20:39.860 --> 20:41.050
- 5 minutes.
- Dad,

20:41.175 --> 20:44.199
you're talking to me on the phone.
And in your voice.

20:45.557 --> 20:48.802
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.498
I love you, honey.
I said it, see?

20:52.867 --> 20:55.563
Haley, wait, I can explain.
I had a good reason.

20:55.688 --> 21:00.070
You grabbed some matches from the hotel.
You Don't want to tear one of those out.

21:00.195 --> 21:02.666
The serious collector keeps
these matchbox intact

21:02.838 --> 21:04.271
Now, it's worthless.
