00:02.333 --> 00:03.291
Are you sure
school's worth all this?

00:03.291 --> 00:06.333
I'm going to graduate,
pass the bar up north

00:06.333 --> 00:07.625
and work in a DA's office
where everybody talks

00:07.625 --> 00:09.333
in flat Yankee vowels.

00:09.333 --> 00:10.667
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:10.667 --> 00:12.000
I have one now...
for cheerleading.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.083
Cheerleading?

00:13.083 --> 00:14.333
- Oh.
- Hello, Marti.

00:14.333 --> 00:15.375
Welcome to Cheertown.

00:15.375 --> 00:16.458
I need two

00:16.458 --> 00:17.500
pre-law students to help me.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.959
A man has been sentenced

00:18.959 --> 00:20.667
to life in prison
for a minor burglary.

00:20.667 --> 00:23.000
I took this case
to get a law overturned.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.667
If there's even the slightest
chance that he's innocent--

00:24.667 --> 00:25.959
If you pass the bar one day

00:25.959 --> 00:27.000
you can take up his cause.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.208
Why wait till then?

00:28.208 --> 00:29.834
My laptop was stolen
from my dorm room.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.208
Hey, Lewis,
have you seen my laptop?

00:31.208 --> 00:32.834
I think somebody's been in here.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.500

'This is a warning
from Overton.'

00:34.500 --> 00:35.834

'Yeah, Lewis and I are dating.'

00:35.834 --> 00:36.917
Do you have a thing for Dan?

00:36.917 --> 00:38.708
Dan and I are just buds.

00:38.708 --> 00:40.834
- What was your first time like?
- It was high school.

00:40.834 --> 00:43.208
- It was totally unexpected.
- Was it romantic?

00:43.208 --> 00:44.208
It was in the back of a Buick.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.542
In the back of a Buick

00:45.542 --> 00:47.083

that way, huh?

04:12.083 --> 04:13.583

about budget cuts

the Hellcats lose resources.

04:16.583 --> 04:17.666

I don't blame you one bit

makes them the priority.

- Yeah but bad for the hellcats.

If we can't train,
we can't place at nationals.

the football team?

04:52.166 --> 04:54.542

04:56.000 --> 04:57.959
I love this magazine.
I really do.

had been friends forever.

And then we hit sophomore year
and something changed.

I don't know if it was chemical
or maybe I just lost my mind.

06:12.125 --> 06:15.417
But...I started
obsessing about him.

06:17.083 --> 06:18.500
I wrote about him in my diary.

10:17.708 --> 10:19.625
Oh, no.

10:19.625 --> 10:22.000
- What?
- Look at the sign-in sheet.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.583
'Julian was here to see Travis.'

10:23.583 --> 10:25.583
'We only missed
him by a half-hour.'

10:25.583 --> 10:27.291
I wonder what he wanted.

10:27.291 --> 10:28.708
Your professor showed up here
like about an hour ago

10:28.708 --> 10:30.083
and asked me all about
the investigative

10:30.083 --> 10:31.583
reports you had me request.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.125
He knows.
He knows everything.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.959
- You think we'll get expelled?
- Okay, calm down.

10:34.959 --> 10:36.458
Well, I'm not going
to a safety school

10:36.458 --> 10:37.792
for you people.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.792
(Marti)
This was a risk
we had to take.

10:39.792 --> 10:40.959
Without those records,
we're never gonna get

10:40.959 --> 10:42.291
Travis out of here.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.625
- What'd you tell him?
- I covered for you.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.458
But y'all need to be a lot more
careful than that.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.750
Believe me, we will.

10:50.291 --> 10:51.625
[sighs]

10:51.625 --> 10:53.000
Did you learn
anything helpful?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.291
Maybe. Um...

10:55.291 --> 10:57.959
- Remember Thornton Eagan?
- Pharmacist. Yeah.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.917
Now, he's the only
prosecution witness who puts you

10:59.917 --> 11:00.959
in his store,
the night of the robbery.

11:00.959 --> 11:01.959
Yeah, that man lied.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.000
I never seen him before

11:03.000 --> 11:04.083
he walked into the courtroom.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.291
Here's what's weird.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.792
Eagan's original statement
from the night

11:06.792 --> 11:08.834
his pharmacy was robbed...
went missing.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.834
Arresting officer
says he lost it.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.417
Court had to rely on a follow-up
report submitted days later.

11:13.417 --> 11:18.041
Oh, and my hack public defender
didn't bother to challenge it.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.458
I swear to God one day,
I'm gonna meet him

11:19.458 --> 11:20.708
in a dark alley
and I'm gonna--

11:20.708 --> 11:22.166
Come on. Stay positive.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.834
Between the pharmacist
changing his story

11:23.834 --> 11:26.166
and Overton bribing that
homeless woman to lie

11:26.166 --> 11:28.333
Travis has clearly
been framed.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.166
If so, somebody went
to a lot of trouble.

11:30.166 --> 11:31.500
Yeah, but why would
they bother?

11:31.500 --> 11:32.667
I play guitar on the streets
for tourists.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.083
I'm nobody.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.125
The cops didn't arrest
you until after they took

11:37.125 --> 11:38.834
that second statement.

11:38.834 --> 11:40.333
Why did they wait?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.333
Maybe someone's trying
to protect the guy

11:41.333 --> 11:42.333
who really did it.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.583
It's a good theory.

11:47.125 --> 11:48.875
We need to figure out if
Eagan changed his story

11:48.875 --> 11:52.208
and, if so, why.

11:52.208 --> 11:53.917
- I say we ask him.
- 'You're dreaming.'

11:53.917 --> 11:55.750
Pencil neck is never gonna
tell you the truth.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.583
He will if we threaten to make
his original statement public.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.542
But we don't have
his original statement.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.500
- But Eagan doesn't know that.
- Exactly.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.500
Oh, I like that, alright.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.834
[exhales]

12:17.041 --> 12:18.250
[doorbell rings]

12:20.208 --> 12:21.542
[sighs]

12:24.000 --> 12:27.041
- Hello, Mrs. Monroe.
- Hello, Dan.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.083
We haven't seen you
since dinner that time.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.041
What can I do for you?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.542
I was trying to reach Savannah.

12:32.542 --> 12:35.083
I was worried something
might be wrong.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.917
Is she here?

12:36.917 --> 12:38.250
I'm sorry, Dan.
She is.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.708
But I don't think
she wants to see you.

12:40.708 --> 12:43.250
Well, if you can just
tell her I was outside--

12:43.250 --> 12:45.708
Actually, I'm quite certain
she doesn't want to see you.

12:45.708 --> 12:47.083
You should give her
some space.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.708
Mrs. Monroe, please.
If I--

12:50.708 --> 12:52.250
I do hope you don't
take this the wrong way

12:52.250 --> 12:56.083
but I would appreciate it
if you didn't come back here.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.708
Well, I'm not sure how to
take that the right way.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.834
Heh.
That's funny.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.417
Nice to see you again, Dan.

13:02.417 --> 13:05.375
[instrumental music]

13:15.917 --> 13:17.083
Char?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.708
Char, are you out here?

13:19.708 --> 13:22.625
[instrumental music]

13:30.959 --> 13:32.458
You hiding?

13:32.458 --> 13:33.667
Absolutely.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.625
Me, too.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.125
Well, are you gonna
sit down or what?

13:46.333 --> 13:48.625
I heard the Cyclones
qualified for sectionals.

13:48.625 --> 13:49.959
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.625
Yeah, we got into
the Southeast qualifier

13:51.625 --> 13:54.834
but it was expensive and now
we need money for sectionals.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.208
Yeah, we had
the exact same problem.

13:57.208 --> 13:59.458
We held a date auction.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.875
- Well, we got a sponsor.
- Really?

14:01.875 --> 14:04.166
Yeah. This rich guy
owns a paper mill

14:04.166 --> 14:06.166
and he wants the Cyclones
to perform at this barbecue

14:06.166 --> 14:08.542
he's throwing for these
big German investors.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.083
He wants to give them
a taste of Memphis.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.834
Or a taste of cute girls
in short skirts.

14:12.834 --> 14:15.000
Maybe, but if we help,
he's gonna sponsor us

14:15.000 --> 14:16.750
all the way
to nationals in Spring.

14:18.708 --> 14:21.667
You could come watch
if you want.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.333
I mean, if you're not
too busy with the Hellcats.

14:26.792 --> 14:27.959
I'd be honored.

14:27.959 --> 14:30.875
[instrumental music]

14:35.333 --> 14:37.583
So, what aren't you
telling me?

14:40.834 --> 14:43.208
I told you.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.375
I'm just taking
a little break.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.125
For God's sakes,
I'm your sister.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.083
Fine.

14:56.500 --> 15:00.500
I was planning on
losing my virginity...with Dan.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.041
No way. You?

15:02.041 --> 15:04.250
Don't worry.
Nothing happened.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.542
It was supposed to be
beautiful and special.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.458
'But it went horribly wrong.'

15:13.750 --> 15:15.875
I found out he
and my roommate Marti...

15:18.166 --> 15:19.208
What's wrong?

15:19.208 --> 15:20.375
[dramatic music]

15:23.083 --> 15:26.125
You're lucky something stopped
you before it was too late.

15:28.417 --> 15:29.834
Char?

15:29.834 --> 15:32.750
[dramatic music]

15:34.917 --> 15:37.375
I took a bunch
of pregnancy tests.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.417
And they all said positive.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.250
Char.

15:46.917 --> 15:48.125
[sobbing]

15:54.708 --> 15:56.917
You wanna tell me
who the guy was?

15:56.917 --> 15:58.291
That doesn't matter.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.333
You didn't use protection?

16:01.333 --> 16:02.667
I wasn't planning
on needing it.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.125
It...it just happened.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.291
And you cannot tell mom.

16:07.917 --> 16:09.750
It'll be okay, Char.
We'll get through this.

16:09.750 --> 16:13.625
Oh, my God. I hate it when
you talk all optimistic.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.792
- Optimism is important.
- I'm sure it is for you.

16:16.792 --> 16:20.375
You left.
You got away.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.500
You could have done
what I did.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.917
After you left?

16:23.917 --> 16:25.708
Not a chance, like...

16:25.708 --> 16:29.750
The only way to have a life
was to go behind mom's back.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.417
Which got me into trouble.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.959
You were gone
and I needed you.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.417
I didn't know you felt
that way. I'm sorry.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.667
It doesn't matter.

16:44.667 --> 16:47.083
[instrumental music]

16:48.708 --> 16:51.125
You have to tell her.
You know that, right?

16:51.125 --> 16:53.333
- Or at least dad.
- No.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.250
You swear you
won't say anything.

16:57.125 --> 17:00.000
(Layne)
'Girls, you out there?'

17:00.000 --> 17:02.500
- Swear it.
- Okay, okay. I swear.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.416
[music continues]

17:06.500 --> 17:07.791
Girls!

17:11.165 --> 17:13.208
I made sandwiches.
You hungry?

17:13.208 --> 17:15.834
- You bet.
- Absolutely.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.040
(Layne)
'Come on.'

17:27.040 --> 17:28.834
(Marti)
'Hi. Mr. Eagan?'

17:28.834 --> 17:32.250
Uh, it's doctor, actually.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.917
Doctor of
pharmacological science.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.500
So you're a vanity doctor.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.000
Like Dr. Dre.
That's chronic.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.375
I'm Marti Perkins
and this is Morgan Pepper.

17:40.375 --> 17:43.417
We're students researching
Tennessee's three-strikes law.

17:43.417 --> 17:46.041
One of the crimes we were
looking into occurred here.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.000
Sure. Uh, yes,
the homeless guy.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.708
I'm glad they got
him off the streets.

17:49.708 --> 17:52.417
Can you tell us your version
of the events that night?

17:52.417 --> 17:54.250
My version?

17:54.250 --> 17:56.417
Well, I was, uh,
in back and closed up.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.375
But he got in somehow,
jumped the counter.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.291
Started taking drugs
off the shelves.

18:01.291 --> 18:05.083
I came in.
He, uh, shoved me, took off.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.625
So you were in back
when he got in?

18:07.625 --> 18:10.208
Yes. Yes, it's all
in my statement.

18:10.208 --> 18:11.708
The second one.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.417
We're actually working off
the original one.

18:13.417 --> 18:16.083
The one the police took
the night the crime occurred.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.417
We're very thorough.

18:18.583 --> 18:21.083
I, uh...

18:21.083 --> 18:23.417
Honestly, it was so long ago.

18:23.417 --> 18:24.917
I don't remember
giving two statements.

18:24.917 --> 18:28.375
Now, I've told you all I know.
There's nothing more.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.417
I am really busy, so, uh

18:30.417 --> 18:33.542
you'll have to do your,
uh, homework somewhere else.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.542
(Morgan)
That was brilliant.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.083
(Marti)
Yeah, we certainly
wigged him out.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.583
(Morgan)
Okay, I'll take
the first shift.

18:43.583 --> 18:46.125
We'll see who shows up,
who he goes to see.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.583
If he's guilty,
he'll reach out.

18:47.583 --> 18:48.959
What makes you so sure
he's gonna meet

18:48.959 --> 18:50.125
somebody in person?

18:50.125 --> 18:51.291
Isn't it easier to just

18:51.291 --> 18:52.583
text or pick up the phone?

18:52.583 --> 18:54.125
Nah.
Electronics are traceable.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.458
It's always safer
to meet face to face.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.458
Well, the upside
of an all-night stakeout

18:57.458 --> 19:00.417
is that I don't have to face a
dorm full of angry cheerleaders.

19:00.417 --> 19:02.792
I'll come to spell you
around 9:00 tonight, okay?

19:02.792 --> 19:05.834
Oh, don't forget to bring
your bottle for urination.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.750
Or, for you, a bowl?

19:07.750 --> 19:08.959
Bucket?

19:08.959 --> 19:10.291
Now you decide.

19:10.291 --> 19:11.458
I'll do that.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.041
[instrumental music]

19:15.792 --> 19:17.917
You ever hear
of returning a phone call?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.583
After what you pulled at
the party I wasn't exactly

19:21.583 --> 19:23.000
in a mood to talk to you.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.417
Well, Savannah won't
talk to me either, so.

19:25.417 --> 19:26.959
Yeah.
She's gone nuculer.

19:26.959 --> 19:30.625
- Nuclear.
- Shut up.

19:30.625 --> 19:34.166
Hey, did you by any chance tell
her how you lost your virginity?

19:34.166 --> 19:37.542
Yeah, but not that it was
with you. Did you?

19:37.542 --> 19:39.041
Yeah, but not that
it was with you.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.500
Oh...

19:40.500 --> 19:42.000
And she put two
and two together.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.208
Oof. She as pissed at
you as she is with me?

19:44.208 --> 19:45.500
Think so, yeah.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.792
All the bobble-heads
want me dead.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.125
I'll make sure you have
a nice funeral.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.834
Open casket, like you like.

19:49.834 --> 19:52.333
Single glycerin tear
running down your face.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.000
Oh, they'll feel
so guilty.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.667
No point in dyin' if you
can't mess with the living.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.250
I want that chiseled
on my tombstone.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.333
Well, since we're both
persona non grata

20:01.333 --> 20:04.375
you wanna hit up Empire,
drown our sorrows?

20:04.375 --> 20:05.959
I've got an all-nighter.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.917
Believe it or not,
I'm stakin' out a pharmacy.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.333
Need a ride-along?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.667
You must have
something better to do.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.708
I have no life.
What time?

20:12.708 --> 20:15.583
Wheels up 8:45.
Wanda's Buick.

20:15.583 --> 20:16.917
Scene of the crime.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.250
Hey. Too soon for jokes.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.166
Never too soon for jokes.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.834
(Vanessa)
We need a place to practice.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.458
There's gotta be
something else available.

20:38.458 --> 20:39.542
What about Crompton Hall?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.041
The old swimming pool's empty.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.500
The library stores
old reference books there.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.000
How 'bout Hartwell Hall,
the old screening room?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.583
No. The college log cabin
republicans have it booked.

20:48.583 --> 20:51.083

It's usually a lot of fun.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.792
That's everything on campus.

20:54.792 --> 20:58.250
I'm sorry I couldn't
help you more.

20:58.250 --> 21:01.041
My squad is gonna
get wiped out.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.250
They're gonna lose
their scholarships.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.834
Look, we'll take anything.

21:05.708 --> 21:06.750
Please.

21:06.750 --> 21:09.583
Okay, not to be repeated.

21:09.583 --> 21:12.417
Bill Marsh has put the word out
on campus to everyone.

21:12.417 --> 21:15.917
You and your Hellcats
don't get to practice anywhere.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.208
How could he do that?

21:18.208 --> 21:19.542
He's football.

21:19.542 --> 21:21.417
He can do anything.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.500
I don't know what you did.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.542
But you picked yourself

21:23.542 --> 21:24.583
a powerful enemy.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.959

gave me a heart attack.

21:41.417 --> 21:44.750
Okay, this is
a dumb question

21:44.750 --> 21:47.625
but...you're not actually
planning on flying

21:47.625 --> 21:49.417
at this Memp-Kris event, right?

21:49.417 --> 21:51.333
Of course, I am.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.500
I don't have a choice.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.959
But what about the baby?

21:54.959 --> 21:56.834
It's an embryo
at this point

21:56.834 --> 21:59.792
no matter what they
tell us in church.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.125
See, I don't believe that.

22:01.125 --> 22:02.792
The internet says
that it's too early

22:02.792 --> 22:04.792
to worry about
hurting anything.

22:04.792 --> 22:06.250
Yeah, well,
the internet also says that

22:06.250 --> 22:08.792
we never landed
on the moon.

22:08.792 --> 22:10.667
What if something goes wrong?

22:10.667 --> 22:13.291
Listen, I'll keep your secret.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.750
I'll lie to mom, but, please...

22:15.750 --> 22:17.667
...see a doctor.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.083
This performance
gets us to nationals.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.625
And the squad needs me.

22:22.625 --> 22:24.750
You understand that
better than anyone.

22:26.375 --> 22:27.875
I don't have a choice.

22:34.375 --> 22:35.792
Well, suppose you did.

22:49.625 --> 22:52.250
I can't believe Wanda
still drives this old thing.

Hey, can we run
the heater again? I'm freezin'.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.083
Nope.
It was on long enough.

22:58.083 --> 23:00.041

Five more minutes.

23:00.041 --> 23:03.417

No. This tank of gas has
to last all week, dude.

23:03.417 --> 23:05.834
Oh, God bless you, Wanda.

23:05.834 --> 23:08.917
- Oh, God.
- Always thinkin' ahead.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.708
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Hee!

23:10.708 --> 23:11.875
You're crazy.

23:13.583 --> 23:16.125
- Mmm.
- Nice.

23:16.125 --> 23:18.083
Oh, yeah.
You could run the car on that.

23:19.583 --> 23:20.708

23:33.667 --> 23:35.333
That'll do the trick.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.333
I think violence in movies
gets an unfair rap.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.542
- Do you?
- Mmm.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.250
I think the way
they encourage

23:41.250 --> 23:43.917
Stalker behavior in males
is way more dangerous.

23:43.917 --> 23:46.250

the wedding in "The Graduate."

a ringing endorsement.

we expected, did it?

Well, it wasn't
that bad, was it?

24:20.750 --> 24:22.750
No. I mean
I ripped off a toenail once.

Uh-uh. You know how I feel
about pay-for-play.

Do you know how that felt?
Any-any idea?

28:43.250 --> 28:45.333
I was scared.

28:45.333 --> 28:46.291
Yeah.

If you'd gotten pregnant,
everything would have changed.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.625
and you froze me out
for six months.

how to face you.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.875

29:23.875 --> 29:26.291

nobody to go through it with.

We got past it.

I am, I am sorry.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.041
I really am.

29:44.959 --> 29:46.083
'Does that help?'

29:51.583 --> 29:53.083
No, not really.

30:14.291 --> 30:17.250

was gonna be so many people...

30:17.250 --> 30:18.583

They'll understand that this is
about being there for my sister.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.583

damn sure they don't find out.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.417
I still don't like her
being here.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.667

I can barely stand up straight.

30:55.667 --> 30:56.834

30:57.834 --> 30:59.750

30:59.750 --> 31:01.333

can go steal it?

31:01.333 --> 31:02.708

31:02.708 --> 31:03.959
Doesn't mean I'm not right.

my sister's feet

31:08.000 --> 31:09.333
with us isn't nearly enough.
