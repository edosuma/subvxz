00:34.300 --> 00:36.400
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:36.400 --> 00:36.934
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.934 --> 00:37.600
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:37.600 --> 00:38.700
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.767
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:39.767 --> 00:40.867
THE WEEK, WHICH HAS BEEN BOTH

00:40.867 --> 00:42.367
HECTIC AND DEPRESSING,

00:42.367 --> 00:43.533
FROM LAST SUNDAY'S MASS SHOOTING

00:43.533 --> 00:45.000
IN LAS VEGAS TO THE ESCALATING

00:52.266 --> 00:53.367
INSISTED ON PRONOUNCING IT

00:53.367 --> 00:55.133
THIS WEEK...

00:55.133 --> 00:56.600

00:56.600 --> 00:57.934
FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:57.934 --> 01:00.400

01:00.400 --> 01:02.834
WE LOVE PUERTO RICO.

01:02.834 --> 01:04.600
>> John: NO, YOU DON'T.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.000
NOBODY LOVES ANYTHING AND STILL

01:06.000 --> 01:08.033
SAYS ITS NAME LIKE THAT.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.000
IF I ASK YOU IF YOU FEEL LIKE

01:09.000 --> 01:10.400
ITALIAN AND YOU SAY, "LET US

01:10.400 --> 01:13.567
ORDER SOME "SPAG-HEHT-TI."

01:13.567 --> 01:15.734
I LOVE "SPAG-HEEHHT-TI,"

01:15.734 --> 01:16.767
THEN YOU DON'T LOVE SPAGHETTI.

01:16.767 --> 01:17.734
YOU HATE ITALIANS, AND WE ARE

01:17.734 --> 01:19.700
NOT HAVING DINNER TOGETHER.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.033
BUT TRUMP WASN'T THE ONLY WORLD

01:21.033 --> 01:22.333
LEADER TO MALFUNCTION THIS WEEK.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.667
IN THE U.K., EMBATTLED PRIME

01:23.667 --> 01:25.133
MINISTER THERESA MAY ADDRESSED

01:25.133 --> 01:26.100
HER PARTY CONFERENCE, HOPING TO

01:26.100 --> 01:27.467
QUELL A REVOLT FROM WITHIN BY

01:27.467 --> 01:30.700
DEMONSTRATING STRONG LEADERSHIP.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.567
HOW DID THAT GO?

01:32.567 --> 01:33.367
>> NEARLY AN HOUR INTO HER

01:33.367 --> 01:35.033
SPEECH, THE SIGN BEHIND HER HEAD

01:35.033 --> 01:37.400
BEGAN FALLING APART,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.200
ONE LETTER AT A TIME.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.500
>> John: THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

01:42.500 --> 01:42.967
LITERALLY.

01:42.967 --> 01:43.467
THAT LITERALLY

01:43.467 --> 01:44.900
WASN'T A GOOD SIGN.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.133
NOT EVERYTHING I SAY HAS TO BE

01:46.133 --> 01:46.600
A JOKE.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.467
I'M ALLOWED TO JUST SAY

01:47.467 --> 01:49.266
TRUE THINGS SOMETIMES.

01:49.266 --> 01:52.066
I'M ALLOWED.

01:52.066 --> 01:53.066
SO MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE U.S.,

01:53.066 --> 01:53.533
WE MARKED THE ONE-YEAR

01:53.533 --> 01:54.233
ANNIVERSARY OF THE

01:54.233 --> 01:55.233
"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE

01:55.233 --> 01:57.000
WITH A SERIES OF GRIM STORIES

01:57.000 --> 01:57.667
CONCERNING THE TREATMENT OF

01:57.667 --> 01:58.633
WOMEN.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.066
"THE TIMES" PUBLISHED A MASSIVE

02:00.066 --> 02:02.233
EXPOSE DETAILING MOVIE EXECUTIVE

02:02.233 --> 02:03.633
HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S YEARS OF

02:03.633 --> 02:05.233
ALLEGED SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

02:05.233 --> 02:05.700
AND HIS RESPONSE

02:05.700 --> 02:08.066
WAS INFURIATING.

02:08.066 --> 02:09.133
BECAUSE HE AND HIS ATTORNEYS

02:09.133 --> 02:10.834
ADMITTED HE NEEDS HELP WHILE

02:10.834 --> 02:12.433
ALSO DENYING THE CHARGES AND

02:12.433 --> 02:13.934
THREATENING TO SUE "THE TIMES."

02:13.934 --> 02:16.300
AND ON TOP OF THAT WAS THIS.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.033
>> WELL, IN A STATEMENT

02:17.033 --> 02:18.867
IN RESPONSE, WEINSTEIN SAYS

02:18.867 --> 02:19.967
IN PART, "I CAME OF AGE

02:19.967 --> 02:21.467
IN THE '60s AND '70s WHEN RULES

02:21.467 --> 02:22.667
ABOUT BEHAVIOR AND WORKPLACES

02:22.667 --> 02:24.300
WERE DIFFERENT.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.400
THAT WAS THE CULTURE THEN.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.166
I HAVE SINCE LEARNED IT'S NOT

02:26.166 --> 02:27.900
AN EXCUSE."

02:27.900 --> 02:28.934
>> John: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.367
YOUR EXCUSE ISN'T AN EXCUSE.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.767
IN FACT, IT ISN'T EVEN AN EXCUSE

02:32.767 --> 02:35.233
FOR THAT BEHAVIOR IN THE '60s.

02:35.233 --> 02:36.633
"WELL, BACK THEN, WE HAD NO IDEA

02:36.633 --> 02:37.533
THAT WOMEN DIDN'T WANT TO BE

02:37.533 --> 02:39.600
FORCED TO LOOK AT DICKS!

02:39.600 --> 02:40.800
THAT WASN'T DISCOVERED

02:40.800 --> 02:43.800
BY SCIENTISTS UNTIL 1998!"

02:43.800 --> 02:45.967
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.

02:45.967 --> 02:46.834
AND NEW STORIES ARE NOW

02:46.834 --> 02:47.867
COMING OUT, INCLUDING AN

02:47.867 --> 02:48.867
ALLEGATION FROM ONE LOCAL NEWS

02:48.867 --> 02:49.900
REPORTER THAT WEINSTEIN

02:49.900 --> 02:51.066
TRAPPED HER IN THE HALLWAY

02:51.066 --> 02:52.300
OF A RESTAURANT, TRIED TO KISS

02:52.300 --> 02:53.600
HER, AND WHEN SHE REFUSED,

02:53.600 --> 02:56.000
HE PROCEEDED TO EXPOSE HIMSELF,

02:56.000 --> 02:57.333
BEFORE EJACULATING QUICKLY

02:57.333 --> 02:59.400
INTO A POTTED PLANT.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.533
SO, STEP ASIDE, "CHOCOLAT."

03:01.533 --> 03:02.400
YOU ARE NO LONGER THE MOST

03:02.400 --> 03:03.734
HORRIFYING PICTURE

03:03.734 --> 03:04.767
THAT HARVEY WEINSTEIN

03:04.767 --> 03:07.133
HAS EVER PRODUCED!

03:07.133 --> 03:08.667
MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP, THE

03:08.667 --> 03:11.233
HARVEY WEINSTEIN OF PRESIDENTS,

03:11.233 --> 03:12.133
HAD HIS OWN SURPRISE FOR WOMEN

03:12.133 --> 03:13.667
THIS WEEK.

03:13.667 --> 03:14.400
>> THIS IS A STORY THAT COULD

03:14.400 --> 03:16.133
AFFECT A LOT OF WOMEN.

03:16.133 --> 03:17.934
A CHANGE TO AN INSURANCE MANDATE

03:17.934 --> 03:19.000
MEANS BIRTH CONTROL

03:19.000 --> 03:21.467
MAY NO LONGER BE COVERED.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.734
NOW EMPLOYERS CAN STOP OFFERING

03:22.734 --> 03:24.367
FREE BIRTH CONTROL IN THEIR

03:24.367 --> 03:25.867
HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS IF THEY

03:25.867 --> 03:27.900
HAVE A SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS

03:27.900 --> 03:31.133
OR MORAL OBJECTION TO IT.

03:31.133 --> 03:31.734
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

03:31.734 --> 03:32.633
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

03:32.633 --> 03:33.233
IS MAKING IT EASIER

03:33.233 --> 03:34.300
FOR EMPLOYERS TO STOP COVERING

03:34.300 --> 03:36.233
EMPLOYEES' BIRTH CONTROL OR,

03:36.233 --> 03:37.266
AS MIKE PENCE UNDOUBTEDLY

03:37.266 --> 03:38.433
WOULD PUT IT, THEY ARE

03:38.433 --> 03:39.133
"DEFENDING THE RIGHT OF

03:39.133 --> 03:40.500
FUTURE BABIES TO CONTINUE

03:40.500 --> 03:41.834
UNIMPEDED THROUGH THE

03:41.834 --> 03:43.100
MALE SIN STICK AND DIRECTLY

03:43.100 --> 03:46.100
INTO A WOMAN'S MOTHERHOLE."

03:46.100 --> 03:48.667
AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS, THERE

03:48.667 --> 03:49.700
HAS BEEN CHAOS IN THE WHITE

03:49.700 --> 03:51.000
HOUSE THIS WEEK, PARTICULARLY

03:51.000 --> 03:51.700
SURROUNDING SECRETARY OF STATE

03:51.700 --> 03:53.367
REX TILLERSON, A MAN WHO IN

03:53.367 --> 03:55.467
EVERY PHOTO LOOKS LIKE HE JUST

03:55.467 --> 03:56.867
SOLD SOMEONE A TOP-OF-THE-LINE

03:56.867 --> 03:59.433
WEBER GRILL.

03:59.433 --> 04:03.033
WELL, IT SEEMS RELATIONS BETWEEN

04:03.033 --> 04:04.567
TILLERSON AND THE PRESIDENT

04:04.567 --> 04:06.533
HAVE HIT AN ALL-TIME LOW.

04:06.533 --> 04:07.667
>> A REPORT ROCKETING AROUND

04:07.667 --> 04:09.934
WASHINGTON: NBC NEWS REPORTING

04:09.934 --> 04:11.800
TILLERSON HAD CALLED TRUMP

04:11.800 --> 04:13.900
A MORON.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.533
>> John: YEAH, A MORON.

04:15.533 --> 04:16.200
NOW, TO BE FAIR, THE STATE

04:16.200 --> 04:17.333
DEPARTMENT DENIED THAT REPORT,

04:17.333 --> 04:18.633
WHICH ACTUALLY PROMPTED NBC TO

04:18.633 --> 04:21.033
ISSUE A CRUCIAL CLARIFICATION

04:21.033 --> 04:22.000
THAT HE'D ACTUALLY CALLED HIM

04:22.000 --> 04:25.233
A FUCKING MORON, WHICH LED

04:25.233 --> 04:28.033
TO THIS AMAZING TV DEBATE.

04:28.033 --> 04:28.867
>> WAS IT "MORON"

04:28.867 --> 04:32.033
OR "F'ING MORON"?

04:32.033 --> 04:33.600
>> IT'S UNCLEAR.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.033
BUT YOU KNOW, IT WAS DEFINITELY

04:35.033 --> 04:39.767
MORON.

04:39.767 --> 04:43.500
>> A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.367
>> John: I GUESS THIS IS JUST

04:44.367 --> 04:45.000
THE TYPE OF DISCUSSION WE NOW

04:45.000 --> 04:45.633
HAVE ON TV.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.533
DOES THE SECRETARY OF STATE

04:46.533 --> 04:47.266
THINK THE PRESIDENT'S A MORON

04:47.266 --> 04:48.834
OR A FUCKING MORON?

04:48.834 --> 04:53.934
'CAUSE IF IT'S JUST "MORON,"

04:53.934 --> 04:54.700
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES HIM

04:54.700 --> 04:55.400
A MODERATE.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.166
AND LOOK, THE BREAKDOWN IN THIS

04:56.166 --> 04:57.300
RELATIONSHIP IS VERY FUNNY.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.333
BUT IT COULD HAVE SERIOUS

04:58.333 --> 05:00.133
CONSEQUENCES, BECAUSE FOREIGN

05:00.133 --> 05:01.533
POWERS MIGHT NOT NEGOTIATE WITH

05:01.533 --> 05:02.333
A DIPLOMAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE

05:02.333 --> 05:03.433
HAS THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.700
AND IF TILLERSON GOES,

05:04.700 --> 05:07.100
HE MIGHT NOT GO ALONE.

05:07.100 --> 05:07.700
>> THERE IS A REPORTED

05:07.700 --> 05:09.100
"SUICIDE PACT" FORGED BETWEEN

05:09.100 --> 05:10.667
MATTIS, MNUCHIN AND TILLERSON

05:10.667 --> 05:11.900
WHEREBY ALL THREE CABINET

05:11.900 --> 05:13.734
SECRETARIES VOW TO LEAVE IN THE

05:13.734 --> 05:16.033
EVENT THE PRESIDENT MAKES MOVES

05:16.033 --> 05:18.166
AGAINST ONE OF THEM.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.266
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

05:19.266 --> 05:20.467
APPARENTLY, THESE THREE CABINET

05:20.467 --> 05:24.633
MEMBERS HAVE A PACT TO QUIT

05:24.633 --> 05:25.633
IF ONE OF THEM IS FIRED,

05:25.633 --> 05:26.433
WHICH MAKES SENSE, EXCEPT...

05:26.433 --> 05:30.200
MNUCHIN?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.467
I MEAN, HE'S SEXY, YEAH.

05:31.467 --> 05:32.233
THE GUY'S A PERFECT TEN.

05:32.233 --> 05:33.066
BUT MNUCHIN THREATENING

05:33.066 --> 05:34.433
TO RESIGN IS A BIT LIKE A BEE

05:34.433 --> 05:35.867
THREATENING TO FLY OUT OF A CAR.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.000
"OKAY.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.567
FUCKING GO THEN."

05:40.567 --> 05:42.266
AND THAT INSTABILITY WITHIN

05:42.266 --> 05:43.133
THE ADMINISTRATION IS EVEN MORE

05:43.133 --> 05:44.333
CONCERNING, GIVEN THE MOST

05:44.333 --> 05:45.734
TERRIFYING STATEMENT THE

05:45.734 --> 05:47.333
PRESIDENT GAVE THIS WEEK.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.533
>> THE PRESIDENT RAISED A LOT OF

05:48.533 --> 05:50.166
EYEBROWS WITH THIS COMMENT ABOUT

05:50.166 --> 05:50.900
THE MILITARY LEADERS HE INVITED

05:50.900 --> 05:51.934
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.900
TAKE A LOOK.

05:53.900 --> 05:54.734
>> YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT THIS

05:54.734 --> 05:59.900
REPRESENTS?

05:59.900 --> 06:00.867
MAYBE THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

06:00.867 --> 06:01.467
>> WHAT'S THE STORM?

06:01.467 --> 06:02.800
>> COULD BE THE CALM --

06:02.800 --> 06:04.133
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.533
>> WHAT STORM, MR. PRESIDENT?

06:05.533 --> 06:08.367
>> YOU'LL FIND OUT.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.166
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU

06:09.166 --> 06:10.867
TALKING ABOUT?

06:10.867 --> 06:12.400
FOR A START, NO MOMENT IN THE

06:12.400 --> 06:13.800
PRECEDING NINE MONTHS HAS BEEN

06:13.800 --> 06:16.066
EVEN REMOTELY CALM.

06:16.066 --> 06:17.700
IT'S LIKE WE'RE TWO HOURS

06:17.700 --> 06:21.000
INTO A SLIPKNOT CONCERT AND THEY

06:21.000 --> 06:22.066
JUST SAID, "ENOUGH BALLADS.

06:22.066 --> 06:22.567
NOW WE'RE GONNA PLAY ONE

06:22.567 --> 06:23.500
THAT ROCKS."

06:23.500 --> 06:26.200
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS?

06:26.200 --> 06:26.867
HE COULD MEAN DECERTIFYING

06:26.867 --> 06:28.033
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.066
IT COULD MEAN LAUNCHING

06:29.066 --> 06:30.266
ALL-OUT WAR WITH NORTH KOREA.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.367
IT COULD MEAN A MILITARY STRIKE

06:32.367 --> 06:34.767
ON "PUERRRTO RIIICO."

06:34.767 --> 06:35.400
OR IT COULD MEAN NOTHING

06:35.400 --> 06:37.266
WHATSOEVER.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.600
BECAUSE, AND HERE I AM DIRECTLY

06:38.600 --> 06:39.967
QUOTING THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.400
I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.000
THESE ARE HIS WORDS, NOT MINE.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.233
IT'S VULGAR AND FRANKLY I DO NOT

06:44.233 --> 06:44.767
APPROVE OF THIS TYPE OF

06:44.767 --> 06:46.266
LANGUAGE.

06:46.266 --> 06:47.467
OUR PRESIDENT

06:47.467 --> 06:50.033
IS A "FUCKING MORON."

06:50.033 --> 06:55.834
AND NOW THIS.

06:55.834 --> 07:00.600
>> Announcer: AND NOW DICKS.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.000
JUST BECAUSE OF THIS HAPPENING

07:04.000 --> 07:06.166
ALONG NORTH MICHIGAN, GOING ALL

07:06.166 --> 07:07.200
THE WAY TO STATE AVENUE.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.266
>> IN THOSE STORMS, MUCH LIKE

07:10.266 --> 07:12.266
LAST NIGHT, MOVED TO THE NORTH

07:12.266 --> 07:12.800
AND EAST.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.633
>> THIS YEAR THE PLACES THAT

07:14.633 --> 07:16.200
JUST DON'T HAVE SNOW.

07:16.200 --> 07:16.867
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.967
>> WHIPPED WE ARE GOING TO BE

07:18.967 --> 07:21.867
SAYING IS A LOT OF ENERGY

07:21.867 --> 07:22.166
CLIMBING UP.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.033
>> TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO BE

07:24.033 --> 07:25.333
A FEW DEGREES HIGHER TOMORROW.

07:25.333 --> 07:30.200
>> FORECAST SHOWS YOU --

07:30.200 --> 07:30.867
WATCH THE PRECIPITATION.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.300
SOME WILL HEAD WEST.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.467
>> SOME KIND OF, I DON'T KNOW IF

07:35.467 --> 07:37.033
IT'S A PICTURE OR MESSAGE.

07:37.033 --> 07:41.600
>> CRUDE VERSION OF A MAP OF THE

07:41.600 --> 07:42.166
UNITED STATES.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.967
HOW IS THIS ONE?

07:43.967 --> 07:46.433
>> A CANNON.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.200
I DON'T KNOW.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.133
>> WHAT DO YOU DO?

07:50.133 --> 07:51.500
>> THESE YOU CAN BUY.

07:51.500 --> 07:59.266
THESE I MAKE.

07:59.266 --> 07:59.934
'S WANTED I JUST MAKE THERE?

07:59.934 --> 08:02.667
HOLD ON.

08:02.667 --> 08:03.367
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.000
BEFORE OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

08:04.000 --> 08:04.500
I'D LIKE TO DO SOMETHING

08:04.500 --> 08:05.834
A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND JUST

08:05.834 --> 08:06.533
QUICKLY TELL YOU ABOUT A BELOVED

08:06.533 --> 08:09.000
ICON OF MY CHILDHOOD: THIS MAN.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.600
>> FOR 20 YEARS, HE MADE

08:10.600 --> 08:12.133
THE DREAMS OF YOUNG PEOPLE

08:12.133 --> 08:14.000
COME TRUE WITH HIS HUGELY

08:14.000 --> 08:16.767
POPULAR "JIM'LL FIX IT" PROGRAM.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.033
BEST KNOWN FOR HIS TRADEMARK

08:18.033 --> 08:20.000
JEWELRY, TRACK SUITS,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.633
TINTED GLASSES,

08:21.633 --> 08:23.433
AND HAVANA CIGAR.

08:23.433 --> 08:24.033
>> John: I KNOW IT'S HARD

08:24.033 --> 08:24.800
TO BELIEVE, BUT THAT

08:24.800 --> 08:25.633
BIZARRE-LOOKING MAN,

08:25.633 --> 08:26.600
JIMMY SAVILE,

08:26.600 --> 08:28.000
WAS A NATIONAL HERO.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.066
WE NAMED PLACES FOR HIM.

08:29.066 --> 08:30.333
WE GAVE HIM A KNIGHTHOOD.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.834
WE EVEN PUT UP THIS STATUE

08:31.834 --> 08:33.533
OF HIM, EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS

08:33.533 --> 08:35.300
MORE LIKE A CHEESE SCULPTURE

08:35.300 --> 08:36.066
OF GEORGE CARLIN THAT SOMEONE

08:36.066 --> 08:37.367
LEFT IN THE SUN.

08:37.367 --> 08:38.533
HE HAD A SHOW CALLED

08:38.533 --> 08:39.600
"JIM'LL FIX IT" WHERE HE

08:39.600 --> 08:40.967
BASICALLY GRANTED WISHES,

08:40.967 --> 08:42.000
AND LIKE MANY KIDS, I ACTUALLY

08:42.000 --> 08:43.567
WROTE TO HIM.

08:43.567 --> 08:44.533
I ASKED HIM TO MAKE ME

08:44.533 --> 08:45.200
THE MASCOT FOR LIVERPOOL

08:45.200 --> 08:46.367
FOOTBALL CLUB.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.767
AND HE NEVER WROTE BACK.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.200
WHICH I'M ACTUALLY GLAD ABOUT,

08:49.200 --> 08:50.667
BECAUSE AFTER HE DIED, BRITAIN

08:50.667 --> 08:52.066
BEGAN TO FIND OUT WHO HE REALLY

08:52.066 --> 08:54.967
WAS, AND THE TRUTH WAS HORRIFIC.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.200
>> HE'S GONE FROM A MUCH-LOVED

08:56.200 --> 08:57.734
ENTERTAINER AND RESPECTED

08:57.734 --> 08:59.633
CHARITY FUNDRAISER TO A MAN

08:59.633 --> 09:02.000
DESCRIBED BY SCOTLAND YARD

09:02.000 --> 09:04.266
AS A PREDATORY SEX OFFENDER.

09:04.266 --> 09:05.266
>> JIMMY SAVILE'S HEADSTONE WAS

09:05.266 --> 09:07.600
HERE FOR LESS THAN THREE WEEKS.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.166
HIS EPITAPH READ

09:09.166 --> 09:13.633
"IT WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED".

09:13.633 --> 09:15.467
>> John: OH, THAT IS AN

09:15.467 --> 09:16.600
UNSETTLING THING TO HAVE WRITTEN

09:16.600 --> 09:18.033
ON A GRAVESTONE,

09:18.033 --> 09:18.800
ALTHOUGH NEARLY EVERY FAMOUS

09:18.800 --> 09:19.767
EPITAPH WOULD SOUND HORRIFYING

09:19.767 --> 09:20.734
WRITTEN ON A SEX OFFENDER'S

09:20.734 --> 09:21.767
GRAVESTONE, FROM DEAN MARTIN'S

09:21.767 --> 09:22.867
"EVERYBODY LOVES SOMEBODY

09:22.867 --> 09:24.667
SOMETIME,"

09:24.667 --> 09:25.900
TO RODNEY DANGERFIELD'S

09:25.900 --> 09:28.800
"THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD."

09:28.800 --> 09:30.100
FUNNY, BUT IF HE'D BEEN

09:30.100 --> 09:32.700
A SEX OFFENDER, NOT SO MUCH.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.300
SAVILE'S HEADSTONE

09:33.300 --> 09:34.600
WAS TAKEN DOWN.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.900
AS WAS THAT SIGN

09:35.900 --> 09:39.233
AND THAT CREEPY STATUE.

09:39.233 --> 09:39.967
ONCE WE FOUND OUT

09:39.967 --> 09:40.800
HE WAS A MONSTER, WE ACCEPTED IT

09:40.800 --> 09:41.533
WAS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE

09:41.533 --> 09:43.066
TO PUBLICLY GLORIFY HIM,

09:43.066 --> 09:43.867
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR MAIN

09:43.867 --> 09:44.800
STORY TONIGHT:

09:44.800 --> 09:46.800
THE CONFEDERACY,

09:46.800 --> 09:47.900
AMERICA'S TRACKSUIT

09:47.900 --> 09:50.066
SEX OFFENDER.

09:50.066 --> 09:51.500
IN RECENT YEARS, THERE'S BEEN

09:51.500 --> 09:53.233
A ROBUST DEBATE OVER CONFEDERATE

09:53.233 --> 09:55.233
SYMBOLS, FROM FLAGS BEING TAKEN

09:55.233 --> 09:57.700
DOWN TO STATUES BEING REMOVED TO

09:57.700 --> 09:58.800
THE WHITE NATIONALIST RALLIES

09:58.800 --> 10:00.033
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, BOTH THE ONE

10:00.033 --> 10:00.767
THAT ENDED IN VIOLENCE

10:00.767 --> 10:02.500
IN AUGUST AND ANOTHER ONE

10:02.500 --> 10:04.233
THAT HAPPENED JUST LAST NIGHT.

10:04.233 --> 10:05.667
SO AS THIS DEBATE IS CLEARLY NOT

10:05.667 --> 10:06.867
GOING AWAY, WE WANTED TO TAKE

10:06.867 --> 10:08.867
A LOOK AT SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.133
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK

10:10.133 --> 10:11.667
HARD TO FIND PEOPLE VERY UPSET

10:11.667 --> 10:12.700
AT THE IDEA OF CONFEDERATE

10:12.700 --> 10:14.967
STATUES BEING TAKEN AWAY.

10:14.967 --> 10:17.066
>> YOU CAN'T CHANGE HISTORY.

10:17.066 --> 10:18.200
YOU CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE

10:18.200 --> 10:20.400
WHAT YOU DECIDE IS HISTORY.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.166
>> I THINK THEY OUGHT TO JUST

10:21.166 --> 10:22.000
LEAVE THEM ALONE.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.567
LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE,

10:22.567 --> 10:23.800
YOU KNOW.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.700
THEY'RE PART OF HISTORY.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.400
>> I JUST DON'T THINK WE CAN

10:25.400 --> 10:27.633
ERASE OUR HISTORY.

10:27.633 --> 10:28.834
>> IT MAY NOT REPRESENT THE BEST

10:28.834 --> 10:31.967
IDEA THAT ANYBODY EVER CAME UP

10:31.967 --> 10:35.467
WITH, BUT NEVERTHELESS IT'S PART

10:35.467 --> 10:37.967
OF OUR HISTORY AND I THINK

10:37.967 --> 10:40.200
IT SHOULD STAY THERE.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.000
>> John: I'LL GIVE HIM THIS:

10:41.000 --> 10:42.133
HE'S RIGHT THAT THE CONFEDERACY

10:42.133 --> 10:43.300
AND EVERYTHING THAT CAME WITH IT

10:43.300 --> 10:44.767
IS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, NOT THE

10:44.767 --> 10:46.767
BEST IDEA ANYBODY EVER CAME UP

10:46.767 --> 10:48.033
WITH.

10:48.033 --> 10:48.967
BECAUSE THAT, OF COURSE,

10:48.967 --> 10:50.033
IS MAKING GRILLED CHEESE

10:50.033 --> 10:52.500
ON A TOASTER TURNED SIDEWAYS.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.400
THAT'S A BILLION-DOLLAR IDEA

10:54.400 --> 10:57.033
THAT IS ALSO WORTHLESS.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.166
BUT THEY ARE RIGHT ABOUT ONE

10:58.166 --> 11:00.500
THING: WE SHOULD REMEMBER

11:00.500 --> 11:01.367
OUR HISTORY.

11:01.367 --> 11:02.800
SO TONIGHT, LET'S DO THAT AND

11:02.800 --> 11:04.266
LOOK AT THE UNIQUE HERITAGE OF

11:04.266 --> 11:05.767
THESE SYMBOLS, STARTING WITH THE

11:05.767 --> 11:07.266
FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT MORE

11:07.266 --> 11:08.333
THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.233
>> THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW

11:09.233 --> 11:11.033
CENTER FOUND SOME 1500

11:11.033 --> 11:12.266
CONFEDERATE MEMORIALS

11:12.266 --> 11:13.834
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.633
MORE THAN 700 OF THEM ARE

11:15.633 --> 11:17.600
STATUES AND MONUMENTS,

11:17.600 --> 11:19.700
AND 10 U.S. MILITARY BASES ARE

11:19.700 --> 11:22.166
NAMED FOR CONFEDERATE OFFICERS.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.400
>> John: THINK ABOUT THAT.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.066
THERE ARE U.S. MILITARY BASES

11:25.066 --> 11:27.834
NAMED FOR CONFEDERATE OFFICERS.

11:27.834 --> 11:28.834
AND THEY WERE THE ENEMY!

11:28.834 --> 11:30.767
THEY KILLED U.S. SOLDIERS!

11:30.767 --> 11:31.667
THAT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT

11:31.667 --> 11:32.767
NANCY KERRIGAN NAMED HER CHILD

11:32.767 --> 11:34.467
"TONYA HARDING."

11:34.467 --> 11:39.266
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

11:39.266 --> 11:40.700
THAT'S A WEIRD CHOICE.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.367
AND TRIBUTES TO THE CONFEDERACY

11:41.367 --> 11:42.500
ARE EVERYWHERE.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.233
IN THE SOUTH AND, NOTABLY,

11:43.233 --> 11:44.734
SOME IN THE NORTH TOO.

11:44.734 --> 11:46.300
AND THAT MAP DOESN'T INCLUDE

11:46.300 --> 11:47.133
KITSCHY WAYS THE CIVIL WAR

11:47.133 --> 11:48.734
IS PRESENTED, LIKE AT THIS

11:48.734 --> 11:50.433
FAMILY RESTAURANT.

11:50.433 --> 11:53.000
>> DOLLY PARTON'S DIXIE STAMPEDE

11:53.000 --> 11:54.100
BRINGS A RIP-ROARING TASTE OF

11:54.100 --> 11:55.667
AMERICA TO LIFE!

11:55.667 --> 11:57.400
DIXIE STAMPEDE IS A MUSICAL

11:57.400 --> 12:00.533
EXTRAVAGANZA OF SIGHT AND SOUND

12:00.533 --> 12:02.400
CENTERED AROUND A FRIENDLY

12:02.400 --> 12:03.734
NORTH-SOUTH RIVALRY.

12:03.734 --> 12:05.066
FRIENDLY SERVERS BRING THE

12:05.066 --> 12:07.934
DELICIOUS FEAST RIGHT TO YOU,

12:07.934 --> 12:09.266
INCLUDING A WHOLE ROTISSERIE

12:09.266 --> 12:10.567
CHICKEN AND ALL THE PEPSI,

12:10.567 --> 12:15.400
ICED TEA, OR COFFEE YOU LIKE.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.233
>> John: YES, THAT'S A

12:16.233 --> 12:17.000
CONFEDERATE SOLDIER SERVING

12:17.000 --> 12:18.100
A SMALL CHILD ALL THE PEPSI

12:18.100 --> 12:19.200
SHE LIKES, WHICH IS STILL,

12:19.200 --> 12:20.500
REMARKABLY, ONLY PEPSI'S

12:20.500 --> 12:26.400
SECOND WORST AD CAMPAIGN.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.834
AND THE THING IS, IF YOU GREW UP

12:28.834 --> 12:29.934
WITH EXPERIENCES LIKE THAT,

12:29.934 --> 12:32.233
IT CAN SEEM LIKE THE CIVIL WAR

12:32.233 --> 12:34.333
IS JUST A FRIENDLY RIVALRY,

12:34.333 --> 12:34.934
A FUN, COLORFUL PART OF U.S.

12:34.934 --> 12:35.734
HISTORY.

12:35.734 --> 12:36.400
BUT THAT OMITS THE KEY FACT

12:36.400 --> 12:37.300
ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR:

12:37.300 --> 12:38.233
THE CONFEDERACY WAS FIGHTING FOR

12:38.233 --> 12:39.834
THE PRESERVATION OF SLAVERY.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.500
AND THAT'S NOT MY OPINION.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.367
THAT'S JUST A FACT.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.500
THERE ARE MANY WAYS WE KNOW

12:43.500 --> 12:44.567
THIS.

12:44.567 --> 12:45.533
SLAVERY'S MENTIONED IN

12:45.533 --> 12:46.934
MULTIPLE STATES' DECLARATIONS

12:46.934 --> 12:48.133
OF SECESSION, WITH MISSISSIPPI'S

12:48.133 --> 12:49.467
SAYING, "OUR POSITION

12:49.467 --> 12:50.667
IS THOROUGHLY IDENTIFIED WITH

12:50.667 --> 12:52.867
THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY"

12:52.867 --> 12:54.233
THE CONFEDERATE CONSTITUTION

12:54.233 --> 12:55.734
CONTAINS A CLAUSE ENSHRINING

12:55.734 --> 12:57.266
SLAVERY FOREVER, AND THEN

12:57.266 --> 12:57.934
THERE'S THE SPEECH

12:57.934 --> 12:58.767
ALEXANDER STEPHENS,

12:58.767 --> 13:00.166
THE CONFEDERATE VICE PRESIDENT,

13:00.166 --> 13:02.200
GAVE IN 1861, IN WHICH HE

13:02.200 --> 13:04.333
ARTICULATED THE BASIC PRINCIPLES

13:04.333 --> 13:06.467
FOR THE CONFEDERATE NATION.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.367
>> "ITS FOUNDATIONS ARE LAID,

13:08.367 --> 13:09.700
ITS CORNERSTONE RESTS UPON THE

13:09.700 --> 13:11.500
GREAT TRUTH, THAT THE NEGRO IS

13:11.500 --> 13:13.467
NOT EQUAL TO THE WHITE MAN,

13:13.467 --> 13:14.967
THAT SLAVERY -- SUBORDINATION

13:14.967 --> 13:17.033
TO THE SUPERIOR RACE -- IS HIS

13:17.033 --> 13:20.800
NATURAL AND NORMAL CONDITION."

13:20.800 --> 13:22.100
>> John: WOW, "SUBORDINATION

13:22.100 --> 13:24.133
TO THE SUPERIOR RACE"?

13:24.133 --> 13:25.767
THAT IS EXPLICIT.

13:25.767 --> 13:27.233
IF THE CONFEDERACY WASN'T ABOUT

13:27.233 --> 13:29.300
SLAVERY, SOMEBODY SHOULD REALLY

13:29.300 --> 13:30.734
GO BACK IN TIME AND TELL

13:30.734 --> 13:33.400
THE FUCKING CONFEDERACY.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.934
AND YET, REMARKABLY, MANY PEOPLE

13:34.934 --> 13:36.000
THINK THE CIVIL WAR WAS OVER

13:36.000 --> 13:37.834
SOMETHING ELSE.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.033
>> WHEN PEOPLE WERE ASKED WHAT

13:39.033 --> 13:39.934
DO THEY THINK THE MAIN CAUSE

13:39.934 --> 13:43.200
OF THE CIVIL WAR IS, 48% SAID

13:43.200 --> 13:45.900
MAINLY ABOUT STATES' RIGHTS.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.600
ONLY 38% SAID MAINLY ABOUT

13:47.600 --> 13:49.266
SLAVERY.

13:49.266 --> 13:53.333
9% SAID BOTH.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.467
>> John: AND THAT'S AMAZING.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.200
ONLY 38% THOUGHT THE CIVIL WAR

13:56.200 --> 13:57.600
WAS MAINLY ABOUT SLAVERY.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.266
IN OTHER WORDS, LOOK TO YOUR

13:58.266 --> 13:59.333
LEFT.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.567
NOW LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.433
STATISTICALLY, ALL THREE OF YOU

14:02.433 --> 14:04.934
LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE ONLY 38%

14:04.934 --> 14:06.367
OF PEOPLE THINK THE CIVIL WAR

14:06.367 --> 14:08.800
WAS MAINLY ABOUT SLAVERY.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.600
AND ON THAT "STATES' RIGHTS"

14:09.600 --> 14:11.633
ARGUMENT, FOR THE RECORD,

14:11.633 --> 14:13.667
THE SOUTHERN STATES WERE

14:13.667 --> 14:15.066
ARDENTLY PRO-STATES' RIGHTS,

14:15.066 --> 14:15.834
BUT WITH SOME GLARING

14:15.834 --> 14:17.266
EXCEPTIONS.

14:17.266 --> 14:18.600
NOTABLY, WHEN NORTHERN STATES

14:18.600 --> 14:20.033
PASSED LAWS TO HELP PROTECT

14:20.033 --> 14:22.133
RUNAWAY SLAVES, THE SOUTH WANTED

14:22.133 --> 14:23.400
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

14:23.400 --> 14:25.900
TO OVERRIDE THOSE STATES' LAWS.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.734
SO, THEY LOVED STATES' RIGHTS,

14:27.734 --> 14:29.166
AS LONG AS THEY WERE THE RIGHT

14:29.166 --> 14:30.533
STATES' RIGHTS.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.333
THE WRONG STATES' RIGHTS WOULD

14:32.333 --> 14:34.734
BE STATES' WRONGS, WRONGS WHICH

14:34.734 --> 14:36.200
NEEDED TO BE RIGHTED BY THE

14:36.200 --> 14:37.400
RIGHT STATES' RIGHTS.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.567
LOOK, TO PUT IT REALLY SIMPLY.

14:38.567 --> 14:39.934
THEY JUST WANTED TO OWN

14:39.934 --> 14:44.333
MUCH CARE HOW.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.266
THAT'S A VERY HARD FACT

14:45.266 --> 14:46.900
FOR SOME PEOPLE TO ACCEPT.

14:46.900 --> 14:47.600
ESPECIALLY IF A MEMBER OF YOUR

14:47.600 --> 14:48.100
FAMILY FOUGHT FOR THE

14:48.100 --> 14:49.033
CONFEDERACY.

14:49.033 --> 14:49.934
AND SOMETIMES,

14:49.934 --> 14:51.100
THE UNDERSTANDABLE DESIRE TO

14:51.100 --> 14:53.967
DISTANCE YOUR RELATIVE FROM THAT

14:53.967 --> 14:55.767
CAUSE CAN LEAD TO PEOPLE

14:55.767 --> 15:01.033
DISTORTING THE CAUSE ITSELF.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.533
WATCH AS ONE MAN AT A COMMUNITY

15:03.533 --> 15:04.200
MEETING IN NORTH CAROLINA

15:04.200 --> 15:04.767
DEFEND A CONFEDERATE STATUE

15:04.767 --> 15:05.333
BY TALKING ABOUT HIS FAMILY

15:05.333 --> 15:06.033
HISTORY.

15:06.033 --> 15:06.700
>> MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER

15:06.700 --> 15:08.633
WAS A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER.

15:08.633 --> 15:11.533
AND I WAS PROUD OF THAT BECAUSE

15:11.533 --> 15:14.767
MY OPINION OF HIS FIGHT

15:14.767 --> 15:17.500
WAS FOR HIS RIGHTS.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.467
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS RIGHTS

15:18.467 --> 15:19.066
WERE.

15:19.066 --> 15:20.700
I WASN'T THERE.

15:20.700 --> 15:21.600
HE WAS DEAD LONG

15:21.600 --> 15:24.266
BEFORE I CAME ALONG.

15:24.266 --> 15:25.900
BUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED

15:25.900 --> 15:26.567
ABOUT OUR MONUMENT.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.300
I WANT IT TO STAY.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.967
IT REMINDS ME THAT I GOT

15:31.967 --> 15:34.200
A LITTLE REBEL IN ME.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.767
YOU KNOW, WE ALL WANT TO KIND OF

15:35.767 --> 15:38.166
BE INDEPENDENT.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.767
WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE REBEL

15:39.767 --> 15:42.000
IN US, EVEN THE LADIES.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.567
>> John: OOOH, EVEN THE LADIES!

15:44.567 --> 15:45.700
#Feminism.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.467
#ConfederaShe.

15:48.467 --> 15:51.667
AND LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHY HIS

15:51.667 --> 15:52.934
GREAT-GRANDFATHER FOUGHT.

15:52.934 --> 15:53.734
IT'S HARD TO KNOW THE

15:53.734 --> 15:55.033
MOTIVATIONS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL

15:55.033 --> 15:56.533
SOLDIER.

15:56.533 --> 15:58.033
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT, AGAIN,

15:58.033 --> 15:59.867
COLLECTIVELY, THEY WERE FIGHTING

15:59.867 --> 16:00.700
TO PRESERVE THE INSTITUTION

16:00.700 --> 16:04.567
OF SLAVERY.

16:04.567 --> 16:05.800
AND I DO GET WANTING A MORE

16:05.800 --> 16:07.133
COMFORTABLE HISTORY FOR YOUR

16:07.133 --> 16:08.734
FAMILY, BUT IN DOING SO,

16:08.734 --> 16:09.734
YOU CAN'T INVENT A MORE

16:09.734 --> 16:10.467
COMFORTABLE HISTORY

16:10.467 --> 16:11.767
FOR YOUR COUNTRY.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.567
BECAUSE YOU'D BE ERASING THE

16:13.567 --> 16:15.266
ACTUAL, PAINFUL EXPERIENCES

16:15.266 --> 16:17.200
OF MANY AMERICANS, AS A FELLOW

16:17.200 --> 16:20.100
NORTH CAROLINIAN EXPLAINS.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.934
>> WHEN I WALK PAST THIS STATUE,

16:22.934 --> 16:23.867
I BECOME VERY PAINFUL WHEN

16:23.867 --> 16:25.967
I THINK OF THE SUFFERING

16:25.967 --> 16:28.934
THAT MY ANCESTORS WENT THROUGH.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.033
THEY ENSLAVED PEOPLE, ABUSED

16:31.033 --> 16:32.934
PEOPLE FOR THEIR OWN ECONOMIC

16:32.934 --> 16:36.166
IMPACT, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE

16:36.166 --> 16:42.266
CELEBRATED BY THESE STATUES.

16:42.266 --> 16:43.166
>> John: RIGHT.

16:43.166 --> 16:47.867
THAT'S THE HARSH REALITY OF WHAT

16:47.867 --> 16:50.300
WAS DONE BY THOSE CONFEDERATE

16:50.300 --> 16:52.200
MEN, AND, YES, EVEN THE LADIES.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.233
#ConfederaShe.

16:53.233 --> 16:54.066
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE A PERFECT

16:54.066 --> 16:54.867
CRYSTALLIZATION OF WHAT HAPPENS

16:54.867 --> 16:55.633
WHEN TWO PEOPLE HAVE WILDLY

16:55.633 --> 16:58.967
DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE SAME

16:58.967 --> 17:00.300
SYMBOL, JUST WATCH THIS LOCAL

17:00.300 --> 17:01.166
NEWS CLIP.

17:01.166 --> 17:01.834
>> WHY DO YOU CARRY THAT FLAG?

17:01.834 --> 17:03.066
>> BECAUSE THIS IS MY HERITAGE!

17:03.066 --> 17:04.133
MY FAMILY FOUGHT TO SAVE THEIR

17:04.133 --> 17:06.333
FARM UNDER THIS FLAG!

17:06.333 --> 17:10.567
>> WHO WAS WORKING THAT FARM?

17:10.567 --> 17:11.633
>> John: OOH, THAT IS A GOOD,

17:11.633 --> 17:14.200
TOUGH QUESTION.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.400
AND THE NEWS CLIP CUT OUT THERE,

17:16.400 --> 17:17.300
BUT WE WERE SO INTRIGUED TO FIND

17:17.300 --> 17:18.700
OUT HIS RESPONSE,

17:18.700 --> 17:19.900
WE TRACKED IT DOWN.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.066
AND WHATEVER YOU'RE EXPECTING,

17:22.066 --> 17:24.200
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SURPRISED.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.934
>> WHO WAS WORKING THAT FARM?

17:25.934 --> 17:26.800
MY ANCESTORS WERE.

17:26.800 --> 17:27.433
>> MY FAMILY WAS.

17:27.433 --> 17:28.000
>> WHO WAS WORKING THE FARMS

17:28.000 --> 17:28.467
IN THE SOUTH?

17:28.467 --> 17:29.000
>> THEY WERE POOR.

17:29.000 --> 17:29.667
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A SLAVE

17:29.667 --> 17:31.000
COST BACK THEN?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.133
>> John: WHOA!

17:32.133 --> 17:32.667
WHOA!

17:32.667 --> 17:33.200
WHOA!

17:33.200 --> 17:34.867
WHOA!

17:34.867 --> 17:36.700
YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THE WRONG

17:36.700 --> 17:38.000
WHEN YOU DECIDE YOUR BEST

17:38.000 --> 17:39.066
ARGUMENT IS SCREAMING AT

17:39.066 --> 17:40.433
A BLACK MAN, "DO YOU KNOW

17:40.433 --> 17:44.033
HOW EXPENSIVE YOU USED TO BE?"

17:44.033 --> 17:45.700
IT IS COMMENTS LIKE THAT ONE

17:45.700 --> 17:46.400
THAT LANDED THIS GUY

17:46.400 --> 17:48.000
ON THE COVER OF "HOLY SHIT:

17:48.000 --> 17:48.633
THAT IS NOT REMOTELY THE POINT"

17:48.633 --> 17:51.400
MAGAZINE.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.800
AND LOOK, THAT'S AN INTENSE

17:53.800 --> 17:55.567
EXAMPLE, BUT DENIAL OF THIS

17:55.567 --> 17:57.166
PAINFUL PART OF HISTORY

17:57.166 --> 18:01.834
CAN TAKE MANY FORMS.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.033
PBS' "FINDING YOUR ROOTS,"

18:03.033 --> 18:03.867
WHERE HENRY LOUIS GATES EXPLORES

18:03.867 --> 18:07.000
CELEBRITIES' FAMILY HISTORIES

18:07.000 --> 18:08.033
AND OFTEN FINDS SOME SHIT.

18:08.033 --> 18:08.533
FAMOUSLY, BEN AFFLECK

18:08.533 --> 18:09.433
PULLED STRINGS TO GET THE SHOW

18:09.433 --> 18:10.767
TO REMOVE ALL REFERENCES TO HIS

18:10.767 --> 18:12.200
SLAVE-OWNING ANCESTORS,

18:12.200 --> 18:13.433
AND THOUGH HE LATER APOLOGIZED,

18:13.433 --> 18:16.066
THAT IMPULSE IS NOT GOOD,

18:16.066 --> 18:17.934
BECAUSE IT SANITIZES HISTORY.

18:17.934 --> 18:18.667
AND WHILE THERE'S NO EASY WAY

18:18.667 --> 18:19.800
TO RESPOND TO LEARNING

18:19.800 --> 18:22.300
THAT KIND OF INFORMATION,

18:22.300 --> 18:23.266
IT IS WORTH WATCHING

18:23.266 --> 18:25.834
ANDERSON COOPER FIND OUT

18:25.834 --> 18:27.400
HOW ONE RELATIVE OF HIS DIED.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.000
>> BOYKIN WAS MURDERED

18:29.000 --> 18:30.333
BY A REBELLIOUS SLAVE.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.533
>> WOW.

18:31.533 --> 18:32.834
>> YOUR ANCESTOR WAS BEATEN

18:32.834 --> 18:36.567
TO DEATH WITH A FARM HOE.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.800
>> OH, MY GOD.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.633
THAT'S AMAZING.

18:40.633 --> 18:41.667
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

18:41.667 --> 18:42.300
>> [LAUGHS]

18:42.300 --> 18:44.000
>> I'M BLOWN AWAY.

18:44.000 --> 18:44.900
>> YOU THINK HE DESERVED IT?

18:44.900 --> 18:47.600
>> YEAH.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.300
>> John: WOW.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.033
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:50.033 --> 18:52.567
AS A GENERAL RULE, JUST TRY NOT

18:52.567 --> 18:54.300
TO LIVE A LIFE THAT COULD LEAD

18:54.300 --> 18:56.367
A DESCENDANT TO ONE DAY SAY,

18:56.367 --> 18:57.367
"A GUY SMASHED GRANDPAPPY'S HEAD

18:57.367 --> 18:58.600
IN WITH A GARDEN HOE?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.567
THAT'S AMAZING!

19:00.567 --> 19:03.233
GREAT JOB, THAT GUY!"

19:03.233 --> 19:04.233
BUT MY FAVORITE RESPONSE

19:04.233 --> 19:06.266
TO A NASTY SURPRISE UNDOUBTEDLY

19:06.266 --> 19:07.800
COMES FROM LARRY DAVID, WHO

19:07.800 --> 19:10.400
RECEIVED A REAL ONE-TWO PUNCH.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.467
>> ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT MY

19:11.467 --> 19:13.100
GREAT-GRANDFATHER FOUGHT FOR

19:13.100 --> 19:17.533
THE SOUTH IN THE CIVIL WAR?

19:17.533 --> 19:18.467
WHAT?

19:18.467 --> 19:19.800
ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:19.800 --> 19:22.266
OH, MY GOODNESS.

19:22.266 --> 19:23.266
I HOPE NO SLAVES SHOW UP

19:23.266 --> 19:24.633
ON THIS.

19:24.633 --> 19:27.800
>> PLEASE TURN THE PAGE.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.200
NOW LARRY, THIS IS ANOTHER PART

19:29.200 --> 19:30.700
OF THE 18TH --

19:30.700 --> 19:33.100
>> OH, YOU DID IT.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.200
YOU DID IT.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.600
I KNEW IT!

19:35.600 --> 19:38.767
I KNEW IT!

19:38.767 --> 19:40.300
UNBELIEVABLE.

19:40.300 --> 19:44.166
BOY.

19:44.166 --> 19:48.934
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

19:48.934 --> 19:50.300
>> BOY, OH, BOY.

19:50.300 --> 19:50.767
>> John: YEAH, PRETTY,

19:50.767 --> 19:51.767
PRETTY BAD.

19:51.767 --> 19:52.333
AND LOOK, LARRY DAVID IS NOT

19:52.333 --> 19:53.233
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HIS

19:53.233 --> 19:53.767
ANCESTORS DID.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.066
NONE OF US ARE.

19:55.066 --> 19:56.433
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT, BECAUSE

19:56.433 --> 19:59.300
I'M ENGLISH, AND I WOULD LIKE TO

19:59.300 --> 20:00.700
GO TO AN INDIAN RESTAURANT AGAIN

20:00.700 --> 20:04.767
AT SOME POINT IN MY LIFE.

20:04.767 --> 20:05.967
BUT WE DO HAVE TO RECKON,

20:05.967 --> 20:07.533
PERSONALLY AND AS A COUNTRY,

20:07.533 --> 20:08.700
WITH WHAT OUR HERITAGE MEANS.

20:08.700 --> 20:09.767
YOU CAN'T IGNORE IT,

20:09.767 --> 20:11.233
LIKE BATMAN.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.600
YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S SOMETHING

20:12.600 --> 20:14.800
ELSE, LIKE TOWN MEETING SANTA.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.533
YOU'VE GOT TO ACTIVELY,

20:15.533 --> 20:17.734
PAINFULLY COME TO GRIPS WITH

20:17.734 --> 20:19.467
SLAVERY AND THE LASTING BENEFITS

20:19.467 --> 20:20.734
AND DISADVANTAGES IT CONFERRED

20:20.734 --> 20:21.700
IN WAYS THAT, FRANKLY,

20:21.700 --> 20:23.433
WE HAVEN'T YET.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.333
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US BACK

20:25.333 --> 20:26.367
TO CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.433
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT

20:27.433 --> 20:28.734
THEM THAT SYMBOLIZES

20:28.734 --> 20:29.934
OUR RELUCTANCE TO HAVE THAT

20:29.934 --> 20:32.734
CONVERSATION, AND THAT'S

20:32.734 --> 20:33.967
THE DATES THEY WENT UP.

20:33.967 --> 20:34.834
BECAUSE WHILE SOME INITIAL

20:34.834 --> 20:36.233
MEMORIALS WERE BUILT, MAINLY IN

20:36.233 --> 20:37.200
CEMETERIES, SHORTLY AFTER

20:37.200 --> 20:39.633
THE CIVIL WAR, THE REAL SURGE

20:39.633 --> 20:42.066
CAME MUCH, MUCH LATER.

20:42.066 --> 20:42.734
>> THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW

20:42.734 --> 20:44.166
CENTER SAYS THE MAJORITY OF

20:44.166 --> 20:45.533
THE MORE THAN 700 CONFEDERATE

20:45.533 --> 20:46.967
MONUMENTS IN PUBLIC SPACES

20:46.967 --> 20:49.200
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE ERECTED

20:49.200 --> 20:50.100
DECADES AFTER GENERAL LEE'S

20:50.100 --> 20:51.834
SURRENDER.

20:51.834 --> 20:52.900
>> John: IT'S TRUE, AS THIS

20:52.900 --> 20:53.967
CHART OF THE YEARS THEY WERE

20:53.967 --> 20:55.433
DEDICATED SHOWS, THERE WAS A BIG

20:55.433 --> 20:57.633
SPIKE FROM 1900 TO 1920,

20:57.633 --> 20:58.400
AS WHITE SOUTHERNERS WERE

20:58.400 --> 20:59.533
REASSERTING THEIR DOMINANCE

20:59.533 --> 21:00.100
THROUGH THINGS LIKE

21:00.100 --> 21:02.500
JIM CROW LAWS, WITH ANOTHER

21:02.500 --> 21:04.367
SPIKE IN THE '50s AND '60s,

21:04.367 --> 21:05.667
AS THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

21:05.667 --> 21:07.166
WAS GAINING STEAM.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.066
SO THOSE STATUES WEREN'T SO MUCH

21:08.066 --> 21:10.066
COMMEMORATING RECENTLY FALLEN

21:10.066 --> 21:11.734
DEAD AS SENDING A PRETTY HOSTILE

21:11.734 --> 21:15.100
MESSAGE TO AFRICAN AMERICANS.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.000
AND SENDING MESSAGES IS WHAT

21:17.000 --> 21:19.166
STATUES ARE OFTEN FOR.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.033
THIS ONE SAYS "WE LOVE FREEDOM."

21:21.033 --> 21:22.633
THIS ONE SAYS "THE MOST NOTABLE

21:22.633 --> 21:23.800
THING ABOUT OUR CITY IS A

21:23.800 --> 21:27.967
FICTIONAL CHARACTER," AND THIS

21:27.967 --> 21:31.433
ONE SAYS "ABOUT YEA BIG."

21:31.433 --> 21:33.066
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS

21:33.066 --> 21:35.200
TRYING TO MEASURE, BUT WHATEVER

21:35.200 --> 21:41.367
IT WAS, IT WAS ABOUT YEA BIG.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.233
FOR SOME CONFEDERATE

21:42.233 --> 21:44.033
STATUES, THE INTENT

21:44.033 --> 21:46.100
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.533
IN THAT TOWN MEETING FROM

21:47.533 --> 21:49.133
BEFORE, THE STATUE THEY WERE

21:49.133 --> 21:50.200
DEBATING WAS THIS ONE,

21:50.200 --> 21:52.133
WHICH WENT UP IN 1914,

21:52.133 --> 21:53.900
AND A LEADER OF THE COUNTY'S

21:53.900 --> 21:56.066
CHAPTER OF THE KKK GAVE A SPEECH

21:56.066 --> 21:57.667
AT ITS DEDICATION, CALLING

21:57.667 --> 21:59.400
THE OCCASION AN OPPORTUNITY

21:59.400 --> 22:00.900
"TO RECALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS

22:00.900 --> 22:02.233
OF THE GREAT AND GOOD

22:02.233 --> 22:04.367
OF OUR OWN RACE AND BLOOD,"

22:04.367 --> 22:05.700
WHICH, AGAIN, IS PRETTY

22:05.700 --> 22:08.033
ON-THE-NOSE.

22:08.033 --> 22:09.400
AND THE LARGEST CONFEDERATE

22:09.400 --> 22:10.133
MEMORIAL, THE CARVING ON

22:10.133 --> 22:11.433
STONE MOUNTAIN IN GEORGIA,

22:11.433 --> 22:12.467
IS LOCATED WHERE THE

22:12.467 --> 22:14.734
20TH-CENTURY KKK WAS BORN.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.200
IT DEPICTS THREE CONFEDERATE

22:16.200 --> 22:18.333
LEADERS ON HORSEBACK AND WAS

22:18.333 --> 22:22.033
COMPLETED IN 1972, SO THERE'S

22:22.033 --> 22:24.900
COLOR FOOTAGE OF THE DEDICATION.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.867
>> AFTER NEARLY HALF A CENTURY

22:25.867 --> 22:27.367
OF WORK, THE MEMORIAL CARVING

22:27.367 --> 22:28.700
HERE AT STONE MOUNTAIN IS

22:28.700 --> 22:30.266
FINALLY FINISHED, AND OFFICIALS

22:30.266 --> 22:31.900
ARE CALLING IT THE EIGHTH WONDER

22:31.900 --> 22:33.433
OF THE WORLD.

22:33.433 --> 22:34.567
>> WE MUST RECALL THOSE

22:34.567 --> 22:36.734
PRINCIPLES OF LOYALTY, DIGNITY,

22:36.734 --> 22:39.734
AND HONOR THAT SHINE THROUGH

22:39.734 --> 22:40.834
THE LIVES OF MEN

22:40.834 --> 22:43.166
WE COMMEMORATE TODAY.

22:43.166 --> 22:44.266
>> John: YES, THAT WAS

22:44.266 --> 22:46.000
VICE PRESIDENT SPIRO AGNEW

22:46.000 --> 22:47.767
COMMEMORATING THE LOYALTY

22:47.767 --> 22:52.734
OF LITERAL TRAITORS.

22:52.734 --> 22:53.500
BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT

22:53.500 --> 22:54.600
FROM A MAN WHOSE NAME,

22:54.600 --> 22:55.233
REARRANGED, SPELLS

22:55.233 --> 22:59.333
"GROW A PENIS?"

22:59.333 --> 23:00.400
AND SOME MONUMENTS WENT UP

23:00.400 --> 23:02.533
EVEN MORE RECENTLY.

23:02.533 --> 23:03.700
I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE THAT WAS

23:03.700 --> 23:04.433
ERECTED ON PRIVATE LAND,

23:04.433 --> 23:05.000
BUT VERY MUCH

23:05.000 --> 23:06.300
FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION.

23:06.300 --> 23:09.934
AND ONCE YOU SEE IT,

23:09.934 --> 23:10.567
YOU WILL NOT FORGET IT.

23:10.567 --> 23:11.100
>> THE STATUE WAS ERECTED

23:11.100 --> 23:12.333
IN 1998.

23:12.333 --> 23:13.266
IT PORTRAYS NATHAN BEDFORD

23:13.266 --> 23:15.200
FORREST ON HIS HORSE, GUN IN ONE

23:15.200 --> 23:17.367
HAND AND SWORD IN THE OTHER,

23:17.367 --> 23:18.967
SURROUNDED BY CONFEDERATE STATE

23:18.967 --> 23:20.700
BATTLE FLAGS, VISIBLE FOR ALL

23:20.700 --> 23:26.000
TO SEE ON THE SIDE OF I-65.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
FORREST WAS A CONFEDERATE

23:27.000 --> 23:28.400
GENERAL AND AN EARLY LEADER

23:28.400 --> 23:31.100
OF THE KKK.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.867
>> John: THAT IS JUST

23:32.867 --> 23:34.000
TERRIFYING, REGARDLESS OF

23:34.000 --> 23:35.433
CONTEXT.

23:35.433 --> 23:36.333
HE LOOKS LIKE IF A NICKEL

23:36.333 --> 23:38.667
DID COCAINE.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.000
SO SOME OF THESE STATUES

23:40.000 --> 23:41.233
COMMEMORATE PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT

23:41.233 --> 23:43.100
A WAR TO PRESERVE SLAVERY,

23:43.100 --> 23:43.800
WERE ERECTED TO ASSERT

23:43.800 --> 23:45.233
WHITE SUPREMACY,

23:45.233 --> 23:45.967
AND WERE DEDICATED

23:45.967 --> 23:47.100
BY KLAN MEMBERS.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.500
AND YET, THERE IS A BLANKET

23:48.500 --> 23:50.266
DEFENSE THAT TENDS TO GET

23:50.266 --> 23:51.400
OFFERED BY PEOPLE --

23:51.400 --> 23:52.633
AND NOT JUST PEOPLE.

23:52.633 --> 23:54.000
ALSO THIS GUY.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.100
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY

23:56.100 --> 23:56.867
OUR CULTURE.

23:56.867 --> 23:58.233
THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY

23:58.233 --> 24:01.400
OUR HISTORY.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.400
>> John: OKAY, THE ARGUMENT

24:02.400 --> 24:03.066
IS TAKING THESE STATUES DOWN

24:03.066 --> 24:05.567
OBLITERATES HISTORY,

24:05.567 --> 24:06.433
WHICH IS CLEARLY RIDICULOUS.

24:06.433 --> 24:07.500
FIRST, MONUMENTS AREN'T HOW

24:07.500 --> 24:08.033
WE RECORD HISTORY.

24:08.033 --> 24:09.066
BOOKS ARE.

24:09.066 --> 24:10.533
MUSEUMS ARE.

24:10.533 --> 24:11.867
KEN BURNS' 12-PART MINISERIES

24:11.867 --> 24:13.333
ARE.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.667
STATUES ARE HOW WE GLORIFY

24:14.667 --> 24:16.433
PEOPLE OR, IN THE CASE OF ONE

24:16.433 --> 24:18.033
IN TOKYO, HOW WE GLORIFY

24:18.033 --> 24:20.533
GIANT RADIOACTIVE LIZARDS.

24:20.533 --> 24:21.834
AND YET THE PRESIDENT'S CONCERN

24:21.834 --> 24:22.500
SEEMS TO BE THAT TEARING DOWN

24:22.500 --> 24:23.433
STATUES LEADS TO

24:23.433 --> 24:24.834
A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

24:24.834 --> 24:25.367
>> THIS WEEK,

24:25.367 --> 24:26.934
IT'S ROBERT E. LEE.

24:26.934 --> 24:27.467
I NOTICED THAT

24:27.467 --> 24:29.300
STONEWALL JACKSON'S COMING DOWN.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.033
I WONDER, IS IT

24:30.033 --> 24:31.800
GEORGE WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK?

24:31.800 --> 24:32.834
AND IS IT THOMAS JEFFERSON

24:32.834 --> 24:34.000
THE WEEK AFTER?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.467
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY DO HAVE

24:35.467 --> 24:36.600
TO ASK YOURSELF, WHERE DOES IT

24:36.600 --> 24:38.133
STOP?

24:38.133 --> 24:39.033
>> John: I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IT

24:39.033 --> 24:40.700
STOPS: SOMEWHERE.

24:40.700 --> 24:42.734
ANYTIME SOMEONE ASKS "WHERE DOES

24:42.734 --> 24:44.533
IT STOP?" THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS

24:44.533 --> 24:46.133
FUCKING SOMEWHERE.

24:46.133 --> 24:48.567
YOU MIGHT LET YOUR KID HAVE

24:48.567 --> 24:49.433
TWIZZLERS BUT NOT INJECT

24:49.433 --> 24:51.533
BLACK-TAR HEROIN.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.033
YOU DON'T JUST GO, "WELL, AFTER

24:53.033 --> 24:53.700
THE TWIZZLERS, WHERE DOES IT

24:53.700 --> 24:56.066
STOP?"

24:56.066 --> 24:56.934
AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF

24:56.934 --> 24:58.000
CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS.

24:58.000 --> 24:58.834
THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

24:58.834 --> 25:00.667
ALL PEOPLE, LIVING AND DEAD,

25:00.667 --> 25:02.500
EXIST ON WHAT I'LL CALL

25:02.500 --> 25:03.934
THE HITLER-HANKS SPECTRUM

25:03.934 --> 25:05.066
FROM BAD TO GOOD.

25:05.066 --> 25:06.967
AND AT SOME POINT ON THE

25:06.967 --> 25:09.367
SPECTRUM, MONUMENTS TO HONOR

25:09.367 --> 25:11.633
PEOPLE ARE INAPPROPRIATE.

25:11.633 --> 25:13.633
ALTHOUGH IT GETS TRICKY AROUND

25:13.633 --> 25:15.133
THE MIDDLE, WHERE, OF COURSE,

25:15.133 --> 25:17.633
YOU'LL FIND ADOLF HANKLER.

25:17.633 --> 25:19.000
AND LOOK, THERE ARE CLEARLY

25:19.000 --> 25:20.333
PEOPLE DESERVING OF STATUES

25:20.333 --> 25:22.133
WHO WERE IMPERFECT HUMANS.

25:22.133 --> 25:22.834
AND SOMETIMES OUR STANDARDS

25:22.834 --> 25:24.500
CHANGE OVER TIME, WHICH CAN GET

25:24.500 --> 25:25.867
TRICKY, BECAUSE YOU'RE JUDGING

25:25.867 --> 25:26.767
HISTORICAL FIGURES BY MODERN

25:26.767 --> 25:28.133
STANDARDS.

25:28.133 --> 25:29.000
BUT FOR MANY CONFEDERATE

25:29.000 --> 25:30.734
MONUMENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE

25:30.734 --> 25:33.400
ERECTED WELL AFTER THE CIVIL WAR

25:33.400 --> 25:34.633
VALORIZING THE CAUSE OR

25:34.633 --> 25:36.166
LEADERSHIP OF THE CONFEDERACY,

25:36.166 --> 25:38.700
THIS REALLY ISN'T A CLOSE CALL.

25:38.700 --> 25:39.967
THIS IS YOUR BABYSITTER SHOWING

25:39.967 --> 25:42.533
UP IN A JIMMY SAVILE T-SHIRT.

25:42.533 --> 25:43.600
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK THAT

25:43.600 --> 25:45.266
REPRESENTS, YOU'RE NOT STAYING

25:45.266 --> 25:47.734
HOME WITH MY KID TONIGHT.

25:47.734 --> 25:48.767
AND FOR ROBERT E. LEE

25:48.767 --> 25:51.000
IN PARTICULAR, IT'S EVEN EASIER

25:51.000 --> 25:52.467
BECAUSE OF THIS:

25:52.467 --> 25:53.867
>> INTERESTINGLY, ROBERT E. LEE

25:53.867 --> 25:55.066
WAS ONCE ASKED ABOUT PLACING

25:55.066 --> 25:58.467
MEMORIALS AT GETTYSBURG IN 1869.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.133
THE FORMER GENERAL REPLIED,

26:00.133 --> 26:01.667
"I THINK IT WISER NOT TO KEEP

26:01.667 --> 26:03.467
OPEN THE SORES OF WAR BUT TO

26:03.467 --> 26:04.400
FOLLOW THE EXAMPLES OF THOSE

26:04.400 --> 26:05.934
NATIONS WHO ENDEAVORED TO

26:05.934 --> 26:07.367
OBLITERATE THE MARKS OF CIVIL

26:07.367 --> 26:09.734
STRIFE, TO COMMIT TO OBLIVION

26:09.734 --> 26:15.600
THE FEELINGS ENGENDERED."

26:15.600 --> 26:16.633
>> John: IT'S TRUE,

26:16.633 --> 26:17.233
ROBERT E. LEE

26:17.233 --> 26:18.200
WAS OPPOSED TO STATUES OF PEOPLE

26:18.200 --> 26:18.633
LIKE ROBERT E. LEE.

26:18.633 --> 26:19.633
SO ANY CITY THAT DECIDES TO KEEP

26:19.633 --> 26:20.433
A STATUE OF HIM SHOULD AT LEAST

26:20.433 --> 26:21.734
ADD A SPEECH BUBBLE SAYING,

26:21.734 --> 26:24.967
"YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU

26:24.967 --> 26:25.767
ALL SPECIFICALLY

26:25.767 --> 26:26.500
NOT TO DO THIS."

26:26.500 --> 26:27.934
SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

26:27.934 --> 26:29.266
WELL, I'D ARGUE NOTHING

26:29.266 --> 26:31.233
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

26:31.233 --> 26:32.500
AND TRYING TO PAPER OVER THE

26:32.500 --> 26:34.100
CRACKS CAN MAKE THINGS WORSE.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.467
IN THE '90s, RICHMOND TRIED

26:35.467 --> 26:37.200
TO FIX ITS "MONUMENT AVENUE,"

26:37.200 --> 26:38.667
A STREET LINED WITH STATUES OF

26:38.667 --> 26:40.300
CONFEDERATE LEADERS, BY ADDING

26:40.300 --> 26:42.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN TENNIS LEGEND

26:42.000 --> 26:44.033
ARTHUR ASHE TO IT.

26:44.033 --> 26:45.033
AND YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE

26:45.033 --> 26:46.600
CONFEDERATES A BLACK FRIEND

26:46.600 --> 26:53.700
AND SAY, "WE'RE GOOD, RIGHT?"

26:53.700 --> 26:54.000
WE ARE GOOD.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
ARTHUR IS UP THERE.

26:57.000 --> 26:57.900
SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO LEARN

26:57.900 --> 26:58.467
FROM AND HONOR OUR HISTORY,

26:58.467 --> 26:59.233
PERHAPS THE FIRST STEP MIGHT BE

26:59.233 --> 26:59.800
TO PUT MOST OF THESE STATUES

26:59.800 --> 27:01.033
SOMEWHERE MORE APPROPRIATE,

27:01.033 --> 27:02.667
SURROUNDED BY AMPLE HISTORICAL

27:02.667 --> 27:04.767
CONTEXT, LIKE IN A MUSEUM,

27:04.767 --> 27:06.633
WHERE PEOPLE GO TO PROACTIVELY

27:06.633 --> 27:08.467
LEARN ABOUT HISTORY AND ALSO

27:08.467 --> 27:11.967
TO PUNISH THEIR CHILDREN.

27:11.967 --> 27:12.700
AND PLEASE DON'T THINK OF THIS

27:12.700 --> 27:13.166
AS A LOSS.

27:13.166 --> 27:16.100
BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY

27:16.100 --> 27:16.867
A REAL OPPORTUNITY.

27:16.867 --> 27:18.734
AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

27:18.734 --> 27:20.400
PLEASE COME WITH ME.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.333
BECAUSE IF A PLINTH BECOMES

27:21.333 --> 27:22.734
EMPTY, THAT IS A HUGE CHANCE

27:22.734 --> 27:26.000
FOR YOUR AREA TO HONOR SOMEONE

27:26.000 --> 27:26.900
WHO REALLY DESERVES IT.

27:26.900 --> 27:28.033
AND I HAVE SOME IDEAS

27:28.033 --> 27:29.567
FOR REPLACEMENTS THAT I'D LOVE

27:29.567 --> 27:31.467
TO RUN BY YOU.

27:31.467 --> 27:32.300
FIRST, BEAUFORT COUNTY,

27:32.300 --> 27:33.533
SOUTH CAROLINA.

27:33.533 --> 27:36.133
HOW ABOUT A GIANT STATUE

27:36.133 --> 27:37.633
OF ROBERT SMALLS?

27:37.633 --> 27:40.667
HE WAS BORN INTO SLAVERY,

27:40.667 --> 27:41.433
STOLE A CONFEDERATE BOAT,

27:41.433 --> 27:42.066
AND SAILED IT TO FREEDOM

27:42.066 --> 27:42.800
AND LATER SERVED FIVE TERMS

27:42.800 --> 27:46.367
IN CONGRESS.

27:46.367 --> 27:47.000
THE GUY IS AMAZING!

27:47.000 --> 27:47.700
ATLANTA, TEXAS?

27:47.700 --> 27:49.000
YOU'RE THE BIRTHPLACE TO

27:49.000 --> 27:51.500
BESSIE COLEMAN,

27:51.500 --> 27:52.233
THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN

27:52.233 --> 27:53.400
WOMAN PILOT.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.233
WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT THIS

27:54.233 --> 27:56.967
IN YOUR TOWN?

27:56.967 --> 27:57.967
FLORIDA?

27:57.967 --> 27:58.967
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT AN

27:58.967 --> 28:00.633
INDIVIDUAL, BUT HOW ABOUT

28:00.633 --> 28:01.333
SOMETHING THAT HONORS WHAT YOUR

28:01.333 --> 28:02.700
STATE REPRESENTS?

28:02.700 --> 28:03.433
SOMETHING THAT SAYS "YOU'VE GOT

28:03.433 --> 28:05.734
A LITTLE REBEL IN YOU"?

28:05.734 --> 28:07.367
I GIVE YOU THIS STATUE OF YOUR

28:07.367 --> 28:11.000
OFFICIAL STATE REPTILE,

28:11.000 --> 28:11.767
AN ALLIGATOR GIVING EVERYONE

28:11.767 --> 28:12.900
THE FINGER.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.266
HE'S CALLED HERMAN!

28:14.266 --> 28:16.567
AND HE DEFINITELY SAYS FLORIDA

28:16.567 --> 28:17.500
WHILE ALSO HAVING NOTHING TO DO

28:17.500 --> 28:19.300
WITH SLAVERY!

28:19.300 --> 28:21.734
AND FINALLY, THERE'S CHARLESTON.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.133
TO YOU, I SAY THIS:

28:23.133 --> 28:26.033
