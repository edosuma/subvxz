for the past three days.

grilled cheese and French fries

- So, we know he likes
grilled cheese.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.119
- And French fries.
- And he arrived by private jet.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.421
It's been parked at the county
air strip since he got here.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.556

- He is doing some work here.

I take him his tea
every day at 1 o'clock,

tell anyone what he is doing.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.297
- Well, if he has a private jet,
then he has to be rich.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.234
- Maybe famous.
- Ooh, or maybe even royalty!

02:15.269 --> 02:18.437
- And he's here by himself,
so he's probably single.

find out more about who he is.

wanting to talk with you

02:35.022 --> 02:37.122

we were gonna go,

asked you, so...

Yes! Of course, yes.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.945

to an offline computer,

04:06.981 --> 04:09.248
so no one can
hack into what I'm doing.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.016

Sunday afternoon;

05:59.026 --> 06:01.226
why do your friends
say they're friends with you;

06:01.261 --> 06:03.829
and then we have people write
out the answers longhand,

06:03.864 --> 06:06.164
so they reveal even more
about themselves.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.233

putting pen to paper

06:08.268 --> 06:10.235

of communication.

have never realized they had.

readings every Saturday night.

would be from Middleton?

- [Is this Cassie Nightingale?]

10:19.453 --> 10:22.220
- Yes.
- This is Helen Thorland.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.456
- [Thanks for getting
back to me.]

10:24.491 --> 10:26.825
I got your number
from Phil Sturgess.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.060
You conducted a survey last year
for a dating website

10:29.096 --> 10:31.463
he's working on.
- I supervised the team

10:31.498 --> 10:34.332
that did, yes.
- [Well, I saw
one of the matches]

10:34.368 --> 10:37.402
his program made: two people
who live in my town

10:37.437 --> 10:39.471
and are perfect for each other,

10:39.506 --> 10:42.807
and I wondered if there might
be a way to contact them.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.442
- I'm sorry. We keep

10:44.478 --> 10:46.478
all of our surveys confidential.

10:46.513 --> 10:49.581
- Oh...

10:52.019 --> 10:53.985
- If it helps,
the sample we used

10:54.021 --> 10:56.287
was 300 men and women,

10:56.323 --> 10:58.957
[and we only used people]

10:58.992 --> 11:01.960
[who failed to meet a match
on other dating sites.]

11:01.995 --> 11:03.762
- So they were

11:03.797 --> 11:06.031
really determined
to meet their right match.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.966
- And they were all between

11:08.001 --> 11:10.301
the ages of 25 and 29.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.104
- Well, that's something
to go on. Thank you.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.974
I appreciate your help.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.444
-<i> I just don't see</i>
<i> how it's possible.</i>

11:19.479 --> 11:21.012
The dance is
only a few days away,

11:21.048 --> 11:23.348
and you wanna move it
from indoors at the high school

11:23.383 --> 11:25.183
to outside in the city park?

11:25.218 --> 11:28.453
- I wanna call it
A Night Under the Stars.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.288
- And I call it
wishful thinking.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.357
Have you even
considered the cost?

11:32.392 --> 11:34.993
- I ran the numbers,
and we can make it work.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.995
And it's supposed to be
really nice this weekend,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.963
perfect for all of us
to be outdoors.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
- But you'd still need
a permit, and there is

11:41.034 --> 11:43.034
a rather substantial
fee for that.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.036
- I was sort of wondering

11:45.072 --> 11:47.338
if you knew anyone
influential at City Hall

11:47.374 --> 11:49.140
who might let us do it for free?

11:49.176 --> 11:52.043
- Hmm... Give me some time,

11:52.079 --> 11:54.045
and I'll see what I can do.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.014
- Thank you so much!

11:56.049 --> 11:58.917
- I don't know what it is
about you Merriwicks,

11:58.952 --> 12:01.219
but you always seem to be able
to cast a spell over me.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.756
- That's what I was hoping.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.725
(crickets chirping)

12:06.760 --> 12:08.927
- Maybe I'm old-fashioned
because I don't see how people

12:08.962 --> 12:10.829
can be brought together
by answering the question:

12:10.864 --> 12:13.231
"If you're on a desert island,
what historical figure

12:13.266 --> 12:15.400
would you want with you,
and what would you talk about?"

12:15.435 --> 12:17.669
- I get good information
out of that question.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.671
- Hello, Phil.
- So this one's

12:19.706 --> 12:22.240
still not a believer, huh?
- I'm working on him.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.342
- Other dating sites,
they just ask people

12:24.377 --> 12:26.745
fill-in-the-blank questions,
but I match people

12:26.780 --> 12:29.514
based on different things.
I bring people together

12:29.549 --> 12:31.349
who would have never realized
they were the perfect match.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.119
- How exactly does your program

12:34.154 --> 12:36.087
decide who's supposed
to be a couple?

12:36.123 --> 12:38.456
- No, no, no. That's...
That's the secret part

12:38.492 --> 12:41.960
that's one day gonna
send my IPO through the roof.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.595
- Hmm.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.030
- You know, since your work
is mostly done,

12:46.066 --> 12:48.700
you might enjoy seeing what's
been right outside your door.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.869
There's a park
behind Grey House.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.204
It's a good shortcut
to downtown. You might wanna

12:53.240 --> 12:55.206
see where it leads you.
- Maybe I'll do that

12:55.242 --> 12:58.076
in the morning. Goodnight.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.779
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.784
So...
- Yeah?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.086
- "What traits of yours could
be considered both positive

13:08.121 --> 13:10.088
and negative?"
- For you,

13:10.123 --> 13:12.557
I would write skeptical.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.160
- This woman says
she has energy to burn.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.162
She goes to bed late

13:17.197 --> 13:19.130
because she never falls asleep,

13:19.166 --> 13:21.099
and everybody she shakes
hands with tells her

13:21.134 --> 13:23.501
how warm her hands feel.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.503
When did these people
fill this out?

13:25.539 --> 13:28.072
- Sometime last year. Why?

13:28.108 --> 13:29.941
- Because if a patient of mine
exhibited symptoms

13:29.976 --> 13:33.111
like high metabolism, irregular
sleep patterns and warm skin,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.480
I'd be curious enough
to have them checked out for...

13:35.515 --> 13:38.149
a variety of conditions,
including hyperthyroidism.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.418
- Is it serious?
- It can be.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.421
Especially if she says
she thinks she's so healthy

13:43.456 --> 13:45.190
she's never seen a doctor.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.159
Let me see if I can move
my schedule around tomorrow.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.595
- Why?
- So I have time to work

13:50.630 --> 13:54.098
with you and find the woman
that wrote this.

13:59.673 --> 14:03.074
- OK. So, we know where she
likes to go on weekends.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.543
- Yeah, to that bookstore
downtown. Thank you.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.378
- Which means at least
she lived in Middleton

14:07.414 --> 14:09.247
when she filled out the form.
- Mm-hmm.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.584
Yeah, and her desert island
person is Shakespeare.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.252
She likes to read his sonnets.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.055
- Unless that's just something
she said to sound romantic.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.257
Does anybody really read
Shakespearean sonnets?

14:19.292 --> 14:22.093
- I do.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.828
- What else did she say?

14:23.864 --> 14:25.630
- Oh, she was on the track team

14:25.665 --> 14:27.432
in high school.
- Here in Middleton?

14:27.467 --> 14:30.335
- Yeah, she ran the mile
the year her team won state.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.270
- Oh, so a Middleton athlete

14:32.305 --> 14:33.972
on a state championship team.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.507
- You know, there's... there's
a trophy case at City Hall

14:36.543 --> 14:38.643
with pictures
of all the teams that won.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.745

- Maybe.

a place to start as any.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.083
We can go tomorrow morning.
- Thanks for helping, Sam.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.285

15:07.674 --> 15:09.974

in bloom, and they don't last

that long this time of year,
so I came by to take a look.

15:14.848 --> 15:16.714

I don't know why I ever approved
giving out permits to people

Tell me.

about your energy level

18:56.536 --> 18:59.237
and your metabolism, along with
your aversion to sunlight,

18:59.272 --> 19:02.173
made me think that you might
need some medical attention.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.109

about what?

19:39.946 --> 19:42.113
instead of play.
- No, it's when--

19:42.148 --> 19:45.583
- I'm joking. I know that clean
up means you're batting fourth.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.985
Congratulations.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.121
- Yeah, I'm starting
to think that I might...

19:50.156 --> 19:53.291
- Sorry! Oh, I think
it's Mayor Tinsdale.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.626
Mayor Tinsdale?

19:55.662 --> 19:59.297
Uh-huh.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.832
Really?!

20:01.868 --> 20:04.802
Yes! Yes, of course.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.637
I will get started
on everything right away.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.673
OK. Thank you.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.442
Thank you. Thank you.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.844
That was Mayor Tinsdale,

20:13.880 --> 20:16.647
and she said that we can
have the dance at the park.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.016
- I thought we were
having it at the school.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.818
- I know. I didn't
wanna say anything

20:20.853 --> 20:23.454
until it was official,
but... it's official!

20:23.489 --> 20:25.990
So it is going to be
A Night Under the Stars.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.626
- That's great!
- I know!

20:28.661 --> 20:30.628
But I am going to have
to say no to bowling.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.630
I gotta get home,
put a list together

20:32.665 --> 20:34.365
before the end of the night.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.767
- You have been putting
lists together all week.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.136
It's why I've hardly seen you.
- I know,

20:39.172 --> 20:41.339
but we want everything
to be special, right?

20:41.374 --> 20:45.309
- I guess... but you're gonna
be at my game tomorrow, right?

20:45.345 --> 20:48.312
- Yes, of course!
I wouldn't miss it.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.451
- (Marion):<i> I'm glad</i>
<i> you convinced me to come.</i>

20:53.486 --> 20:56.687
- (Cassie):<i> So are we.</i>
- So, I've asked the lab

20:56.723 --> 20:59.056
to run a few tests
to find out if your thyroid

20:59.092 --> 21:01.058
is functioning properly, but if
it's not, and we caught it

21:01.094 --> 21:03.961
in time, you'll have to take
hormones and beta blockers.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.364
- And what if we didn't
catch it in time?

21:06.399 --> 21:08.132
- Oh, there's an iodine
treatment that's safe,

21:08.167 --> 21:10.368
and there's
very few side effects.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.703
- I can hardly believe

21:12.739 --> 21:14.538
that you were able
to track me down

21:14.574 --> 21:17.074
based on how I answered
a dating questionnaire.

21:17.110 --> 21:20.578
- It's a good thing you were
a Shakespeare-loving track star.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.415
- Marion? They're ready
for you in the lab.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.150
- So, Dr. Stallings

21:26.185 --> 21:28.052
will be the one working
with you down there,

21:28.087 --> 21:30.488
and I'll consult with him
once the results come back.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.423
And oversee your treatment,
if there is any.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.025
I'll see you in a bit.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.994
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.032
- Marion should be thanking you.
There's no way of knowing

21:41.067 --> 21:43.034
that she'd be OK if you hadn't

21:43.069 --> 21:45.102
really wanted to find her
and that man she's so right for.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.104
- Yeah, well, finding her
perfect match doesn't seem like

21:47.140 --> 21:49.240
the most important thing
right now.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.042
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.843
I'll let you know how she is
as soon as I hear anything.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.012
OK?
- Yeah, thanks.

21:59.886 --> 22:03.354
(crickets chirping)

22:06.292 --> 22:08.059
- Oh!
- Excuse me.

22:08.094 --> 22:11.729
- Sorry. So, is that
how your website works?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.731
- Hmm?
- You figure out

22:13.766 --> 22:15.866
where someone's gonna be
and just keep running into them?

22:15.902 --> 22:19.003
- Actually, that's something
I could work into the software.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.272
- But it takes more than
just the right program,

22:21.307 --> 22:23.274
doesn't it?
- It's matching a person

22:23.309 --> 22:25.743
with the thing they desire.
It's simple.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.878
- That just sounds
like marketing.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.880
- It's a lot more than that.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.083
- When I worked in advertising,

22:32.118 --> 22:34.352
it was all about creating
wants and needs

22:34.387 --> 22:36.253
that the customer
didn't even know they had.

22:36.289 --> 22:38.789
- Yes, but people who are alone

22:38.825 --> 22:41.792
all want the same thing.
They all want to not be alone.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.561
- So you're selling them

22:43.596 --> 22:45.563
on the fantasy that there's
someone for everyone?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.631
- I'm selling them on the idea
that if there is someone

22:47.667 --> 22:49.900
out there, I'm gonna
make sure they meet up.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.436
- But how can you be so sure

22:52.472 --> 22:54.271
that they're gonna
find the right one?

22:54.307 --> 22:56.073
- Because I look
under the surface

22:56.109 --> 22:58.709
and get to the intangibles
in a person's life.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.911
My algorithm analyses
key words and phrases,

23:00.947 --> 23:02.646
and it actually reads
between the lines

23:02.682 --> 23:05.549
to form a deeper personality
profile, and then it matches up

23:05.585 --> 23:08.753
people who'd have had no idea
they should even be together.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.621
- That would be amazing...

23:10.656 --> 23:12.390
if it works.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.726
- It's gonna work.
Between the Lines

23:15.762 --> 23:18.929
is going to be the biggest thing
in internet matchmaking ever!

23:18.965 --> 23:20.731
- Abigail!

23:20.767 --> 23:23.501
Martha says we can
have the dance at the park.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.970
- That's great!
- Look out for drones.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.139
- What?
- Never mind.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.107
I should get back to my work,

23:30.143 --> 23:32.810
unless you think
I'm wasting my time.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.512
- I didn't say that.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.480
- No, not exactly.
Not in those words,

23:36.516 --> 23:39.950
but I read between the lines.

23:42.455 --> 23:45.790
- He seems nice.
- Yeah, I guess so.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.459
- You know, he likes you.
- No.

23:48.494 --> 23:51.328
- He likes you.
- He barely knows me.

23:51.364 --> 23:53.464
- Oh, come on. Did you not
just see the way

23:53.499 --> 23:57.168
that he was looking at you?
- No, I didn't.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.969
- Well, then...

23:59.005 --> 24:01.338
it's a good thing that I got
here in time to point it out.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.817
-<i> As Dr. Stallings explained,</i>
<i> you do have hyperthyroidism,</i>

24:12.852 --> 24:15.619
but luckily, we caught it early,
and it's easy to treat.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.521
I want you to make
some changes in your diet,

24:17.557 --> 24:19.723
and a few other adjustments
to your lifestyle.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.893
- Is one of those
lifestyle adjustments

24:22.929 --> 24:24.662
meeting that perfect match

24:24.697 --> 24:26.664
that you and Cassie said
is out there for me?

24:26.699 --> 24:28.566
- Well, if only
it were that easy.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.735
It was hard enough to find you.
- That's OK.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.304
I won't get my hopes up.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.072
Although I guess he's the one

24:35.107 --> 24:37.007
who'll never know
what he's missing.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.310
- That's the way
to think about it.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.913
- When does
the dancefloor arrive?

24:42.949 --> 24:44.715
- Saturday morning, but someone
should be here early

24:44.750 --> 24:46.717
to make sure it gets set up
in the right spot.

24:46.752 --> 24:49.487
- Oh, I can do that.
- OK. And then we can

24:49.522 --> 24:51.489
move the tables
and chairs over here,

24:51.524 --> 24:54.758
and put the heaters in the tent
where the food will be.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.228
- I didn't realize there was
this much to do

24:57.263 --> 24:59.029
just to get ready for a dance.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.031
- Yeah, which is why it's
so great that you're helping us.

25:01.067 --> 25:04.235
- OK. Well, I think we've
got everything all planned out.

25:05.771 --> 25:09.073
I just feel like we're
forgetting something.

25:09.108 --> 25:12.209
- What else is there?

25:12.245 --> 25:15.446
- Noah! Hi!

25:15.481 --> 25:17.715
I forgot your game. I'm sorry.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.850
I'm sorry.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.287
How did you do?

25:23.322 --> 25:25.256
- We won.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.058
- That's great.
- I just, I wanted to make sure

25:28.094 --> 25:30.060
you didn't leave without looking
over the timeline for the night

25:30.096 --> 25:31.962
of the dance. I highlighted
everything you need to do

25:31.998 --> 25:35.232
starting as soon
as you get here.
- OK. Thank you. Thanks.

25:35.268 --> 25:38.068
- So, how much more
committee stuff

25:38.104 --> 25:40.604
do you have to do?
- Just a few more things.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.474
- Do you have to work
during the dance too?

25:43.509 --> 25:45.809
- Just whatever's highlighted.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.081
- You know, all I wanted to do
was dance with my girlfriend.

25:51.117 --> 25:54.151
I didn't know I had to schedule
time in between jobs.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.320
- We can still find the time.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.923
- Look, if you're
gonna be too busy,

25:58.958 --> 26:02.092
maybe we should
just forget about it.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.795
- Forget about what?

26:04.830 --> 26:08.566
- Maybe we shouldn't
go to the dance at all.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.843
- Oh, it's just you.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.347
- Who was I supposed to be?
- I thought you might be Phil.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.249
- No, I think he's
upstairs working.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.518
- Good, because I don't
know what to say

26:27.553 --> 26:30.120
when I run into him again.
- Oh. Have you been

26:30.156 --> 26:32.122
running into him?
- A lot. And your daughter seems

26:32.158 --> 26:34.158
to think that he likes me.
- Grace is a pretty good judge

26:34.193 --> 26:38.996
about those kinds of things.
- I know. What if she's right?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.965
- Guys have liked you before.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.133
- Not one who's practically
living in this house.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.170
- Do you like him?
- I thought that I might,

26:46.205 --> 26:48.205
and then we sort of
started arguing

26:48.240 --> 26:50.975
about how people should meet.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.977
- Right. People who argue

26:53.012 --> 26:55.846
can't possibly be
interested in each other.

26:57.516 --> 27:01.151
- Phil! We were just
talking about you.

27:01.187 --> 27:04.355
- Is it about how you stole
the idea for my website?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.991
- Stole your what?
- I just found out

27:07.026 --> 27:09.026
that someone else is starting
a site exactly like mine.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.629
And the only way they could
have found out about it

27:11.664 --> 27:13.464
is from the only person
that I told.

27:13.499 --> 27:16.166
And the only person
I told was you.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.968
- Why would I have stolen

27:18.004 --> 27:19.903
your idea, and what would I
even do with it?

27:19.939 --> 27:22.406
- Companies pay a lot of money
for intellectual property

27:22.441 --> 27:24.475
like this.
- You think I would do this

27:24.510 --> 27:26.477
for money?
- How do you know it was stolen?

27:26.512 --> 27:29.847
- Because PhysiCorp Systems
just announced

27:29.882 --> 27:32.216
the release date
for their dating website

27:32.251 --> 27:34.718
called In-between the Lines.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.887
It's supposed
to come out three weeks

27:36.922 --> 27:39.423
before mine was going to
go live. They're saying how it

27:39.458 --> 27:41.859
goes beyond the usual
yes and no answers.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.927
It uses an algorithm
exactly like the one

27:43.963 --> 27:46.063
I came up with,
and I wrote it on my whiteboard,

27:46.098 --> 27:48.899
and the only person I told
about the algorithm was you.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.201
I told only you.
- I didn't tell anyone!

27:51.237 --> 27:54.038
- Then how else could they have
found out about it?

27:54.073 --> 27:56.940
You'll be hearing
from my lawyers tomorrow,

27:56.976 --> 27:59.209
which is exactly when I'll
be checking out of this place,

27:59.245 --> 28:01.412
which I wish I'd never come to.

park, and I wanted to tell him

31:44.169 --> 31:46.603

with the prom.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.335
- I might consider doing that.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.174
- Oh, I wanted to catch Grace
and congratulate her

41:18.210 --> 41:20.643
on how the formal went off
without a hitch.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.645
Perfect weather,
well-behaved teens,

41:22.681 --> 41:25.248
and best of all, no drones.
- No drones is pretty much

41:25.283 --> 41:27.817
the key to any successful dance.
- It's the key to everything,

41:27.853 --> 41:30.086
which is why I'm so pleased
that they arrested

41:30.121 --> 41:31.821
that conniving drone operator

41:31.857 --> 41:34.190
for trying to steal that young
man's computer dating idea.

41:34.226 --> 41:37.427
- And I'm glad Abigail was
cleared of any wrongdoing.

41:37.462 --> 41:39.329
- Justice in Middleton is
swift and severe.

41:39.364 --> 41:41.197
Criminals are not welcome here.

41:41.233 --> 41:43.833
Oh! That would make
a great slogan.

41:43.869 --> 41:46.369
I'm gonna put it
on the welcome sign.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.007
- So... I saw Marion last night

41:51.042 --> 41:53.042
at a bookstore.
Guess who she was with?

41:53.078 --> 41:55.445
- Who?
- Stephen Stroud.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.114
- I thought she was
matched with his brother.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.350
- All I know is the two of them
seem to be having a good time.

42:00.385 --> 42:02.151
- So the computer wasn't right
about who's supposed

42:02.187 --> 42:04.354
to be with whom.
- But somehow,

42:04.389 --> 42:06.823
the right two people
ended up together anyway.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.626
It's funny how things work out
that way, isn't it?

42:09.661 --> 42:11.394
- Yeah.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.796
Funny.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.366
