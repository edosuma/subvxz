15:56.346 --> 15:58.044
I LOVE CAMPING. HOW ABOUT YOU?
YOU WANT TO GO?

15:58.566 --> 16:00.698
I DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU SURE
YOU WOULDN'T RATHER GO

16:00.829 --> 16:02.222
-WITHOUT ME?
-AWW, COME ON.

16:02.657 --> 16:03.527
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.670
HEY, DAD, THERE'S THE RIVER.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.454
IT'S A THING OF BEAUTY,
ISN'T IT?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.163
WHOA!

16:32.252 --> 16:33.209
CHECK THAT OUT.

16:33.601 --> 16:34.515
WHOO!

16:48.094 --> 16:49.573
SHE TIPPED OVER!

16:49.704 --> 16:51.532
YEAH, BUT WATCH
HOW SHE RECOVERS.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.449
OOH, BEAUTIFUL.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.103
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.107
-I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RIVER.
-YEAH, RIGHT.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.151
SURE, DAD.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.173
SINCE YOUR UNCLE'S CABIN NOW
BELONGS TO YOU, MR. BUCHANNON,

17:24.304 --> 17:26.435
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CLEANUP.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.004
ANY LEADS
ON WHO TRASHED THIS PLACE?

17:29.874 --> 17:31.963
I HAD A FORENSIC TEAM UP
FROM SACRAMENTO.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.878
NO FINGERPRINTS, HAIR, BLOOD--

17:34.009 --> 17:35.271
NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER.

17:36.446 --> 17:39.058
THE CABIN WAS APPARENTLY
RANSACKED AFTER HIS DEATH.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.972
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.584
UNCLE ALEX PROSPECTED
FOR GOLD HIS WHOLE LIFE.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.151
HE NEVER FOUND
MORE THAN TWO NUGGETS.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.674
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY WERE AFTER?

17:46.804 --> 17:49.198
WELL, A WEEK OR SO
BEFORE HE DIED,

17:49.329 --> 17:50.808
ALEX WAS APPARENTLY DRUNK

17:50.939 --> 17:52.941
AND STARTED BRAGGING
THAT HE FOUND THE BOOT.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.334
THE WHAT?

17:54.464 --> 17:56.075
THE BOOT! THE BOOT. HERE.

17:56.858 --> 17:57.815
YEAH.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.687
IT'S THE BIGGEST GOLD NUGGET

17:59.817 --> 18:01.732
EVER DISCOVERED
DURING THE GOLD RUSH.

18:01.863 --> 18:05.388
HERE, SEE? THE SHAPE OF A COWBOY
BOOT AND JUST AS BIG.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.174
IT'S WORTH MILLIONS,
AND UNCLE ALEX FOUND IT?

18:08.304 --> 18:09.784
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT, HOBIE.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.742
UNCLE ALEX USED TO BRAG

18:11.873 --> 18:14.310
THAT HE FOUND EVERYTHING
FROM THE LOST DUTCHMAN MINE

18:14.441 --> 18:16.573
TO THE TREASURE OF
THE SIERRA MADRE. HE WAS NUTS.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.880
WAIT A MINUTE. IT SAYS
THE GOLDEN BOOT WAS STOLEN

18:19.010 --> 18:21.796
DURING THE TONG WARS. IT HASN'T
BEEN SEEN SINCE THE 1850S.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.842
IT'S SUPPOSEDLY BURIED
SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS RIVER.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.627
I'M AFRAID THAT'S JUST
A RUMOR THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE

18:26.757 --> 18:29.282
-WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE.
-WELL, MAYBE IT'S TRUE.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.545
MAYBE HE REALLY
DID FIND SOMETHING THIS TIME.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.722
I MEAN, WHY ELSE WOULD SOMEBODY
TEAR UP HIS CABIN LIKE THIS?

18:34.852 --> 18:36.071
I'M HOPING
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HELP

18:36.202 --> 18:38.029
ANSWER THAT QUESTION,
MR. BUCHANNON.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.293
YOUR UNCLE LEFT YOU
SOMETHING ELSE IN HIS WILL.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.425
[ENGINE RUNNING]

18:44.601 --> 18:46.299
THAT MUST BE HIM.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.692
WONDER WHAT THE SHERIFF
IS TELLING HIM?

18:58.006 --> 18:59.660
"I ALEX BUCHANNON..."

18:59.790 --> 19:01.575
COME ON, DAD. READ IT OUT LOUD.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.273
"I ALSO BEQUEATH
TO MY NEPHEW MITCH

19:04.404 --> 19:06.145
ALL OBJECTS OF VALUE

19:06.493 --> 19:08.625
CONCEALED IN OUR SECRET SPOT,

19:08.756 --> 19:10.453
WHICH IS KNOWN ONLY TO HIM."

19:10.584 --> 19:12.063
WHAT SECRET SPOT, DAD?

19:12.194 --> 19:13.978
-WHERE IS IT?
-I HAVE NO IDEA.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.154
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT JUST TRYING

19:15.284 --> 19:17.112
TO KEEP IT KNOWN
ONLY TO YOURSELF?

19:17.243 --> 19:19.462
SHERIFF, LAST TIME I SAW
UNCLE ALEX, I WAS HOBIE'S AGE.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.421
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.075
WELL, MAYBE BEING BACK HERE
WILL TRIGGER SOME OLD MEMORIES.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.252
IT'S GOING TO BE DARK
PRETTY SOON.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.688
YOU BETTER GET BACK INTO TOWN.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.212
DAD, I'D KIND OF LIKE
TO CAMP OUT HERE.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.083
I NEVER KNEW UNCLE ALEX,
OR ANYTHING,

19:32.214 --> 19:33.607
BUT IT SURE WOULD BE COOL.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.957
SURE, WHY NOT? IT'S OKAY, HUH?

19:36.087 --> 19:37.480
IT'S YOUR PROPERTY NOW.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.352
WE'RE GOING TO STAY IN THAT CUTE
LITTLE BED AND BREAKFAST

19:39.482 --> 19:41.049
-WE SAW IN TOWN.
-WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.312
NO. I THINK IT WOULD BE FUN.
IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.793
WE COULD ZIP OURSELVES UP
IN A BAG.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.013
ZIPPING MYSELF UP IN A BAG
ON THE GROUND WITH INSECTS

19:49.144 --> 19:50.972
AND SPIDERS LIKE THAT
CRAWLING ON ME

19:51.102 --> 19:52.756
IS NOT MY IDEA OF ROMANCE, OKAY?

19:52.887 --> 19:55.498
I PREFER A FOUR-POSTER BED
AT THE INN WE SAW.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.198
BUT YOU CAN STAY
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.506
SEE YOU GUYS.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.118
SORRY. NO CAMPOUT.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.166
OKAY, WAIT UP, GUYS.
I GOT TO GET THE SLEEPING BAGS.

20:11.601 --> 20:12.646
ADIOS.

20:14.082 --> 20:16.171
HISTORIC SIERRA NEVADA HOUSE

20:53.034 --> 20:54.427
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHERE YOU GOING?

20:54.557 --> 20:55.645
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

20:59.519 --> 21:00.563
OKAY?

22:23.516 --> 22:25.953
[WHISTLING]

22:32.742 --> 22:34.875
[SMOOTH JAZZ PLAYING]

22:50.760 --> 22:51.631
SHAUNI?

22:54.155 --> 22:55.374
HELLO?

23:05.253 --> 23:06.254
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:06.994 --> 23:08.212
-WHAT'S WRONG?
-NOTHING.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.521
YOU GO IN WITH A NEGLIGEE

23:12.652 --> 23:14.393
AND YOU COME OUT
WITH AN ATTITUDE? WHAT--

23:18.266 --> 23:19.789
I DON'T HAVE AN ATTITUDE, EDDIE.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.053
SHAUNI, AWHILE AGO
YOU WERE KISSING ME

23:23.184 --> 23:24.881
LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.796
YEAH AND IF YOU GO TO AUSTRALIA,
THERE WON'T BE, WILL THERE?

23:27.797 --> 23:28.711
I SEE.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.105
IF I GO TO AUSTRALIA,

23:31.235 --> 23:33.150
IT WILL BE FOR A YEAR,
THAT'S ALL.

23:33.281 --> 23:34.674
OH, THAT'S ALL? JUST A YEAR.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.719
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
IN LESS THAN A YEAR, EDDIE.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.329
IF TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER,
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO--

23:38.460 --> 23:39.722
WHAT?

23:40.070 --> 23:41.594
BE HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD
FROM EACH OTHER

23:41.724 --> 23:42.812
AND STILL STAY COMMITTED?

23:43.770 --> 23:44.640
YES.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.687
WELL, UM--

23:49.210 --> 23:50.994
I'M TALKING
ABOUT REAL COMMITMENT.

24:10.361 --> 24:11.711
HOBE, I WAS JUST A KID.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.843
YOU MUST REMEMBER SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.149
COME ON.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.151
THE THING I REMEMBER MOST
ABOUT UNCLE ALEX

24:17.281 --> 24:19.501
WERE HIS HANDS.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.069
HE HAD THESE BIG CALLUSES
ON BOTH OF HIS HANDS

24:22.199 --> 24:23.897
FROM SWINGING PICKS AND SHOVELS.

24:25.072 --> 24:28.162
HE ONCE TOLD ME THE BEST WAY
TO GET RID OF CALLUSES

24:28.292 --> 24:30.904
IS RUBBING GOLD DUST
BETWEEN YOUR HANDS.

24:32.209 --> 24:35.212
DID HE EVER FIND ANY GOLD DUST
WHEN YOU CAME UP TO VISIT HIM?

24:35.343 --> 24:36.257
ONCE.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.215
ONE DAY WE WENT DOWNRIVER,

24:38.346 --> 24:40.174
PANNED FOR HOURS AND HOURS.

24:40.870 --> 24:44.134
ALL WE GOT
WAS DIRT, ROCKS, SUNBURN.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.006
AND I SAID, "COME ON,
LET'S GO HOME. I'M TIRED."

24:46.136 --> 24:47.616
HE GOES, "NO, NO. WAIT.

24:47.921 --> 24:50.314
AT THE END OF THE DAY--
GET LUCKY AT THE END OF THE DAY.

24:50.445 --> 24:51.533
ONE MORE TIME."

24:52.186 --> 24:54.623
SO I TOOK THE PAN.
I PUT IT IN THE RIVER.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.018
I SWIRLED IT AROUND
AND AROUND AND AROUND.

24:58.148 --> 24:59.976
WASHED OFF ALL THE WATER,

25:01.891 --> 25:02.936
AND THERE IT WAS

25:03.545 --> 25:05.112
IN THE BOTTOM OF MY PAN.

25:06.156 --> 25:07.201
A GOLD NUGGET.

25:07.897 --> 25:10.509
-REAL GOLD?
-REAL GOLD.

25:12.032 --> 25:15.035
NOW, I'M SURE
UNCLE ALEX PUT IT IN THERE.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.515
BUT IT WAS REAL GOLD.

25:17.428 --> 25:18.473
WOW.

25:20.475 --> 25:22.346
-WAIT A MINUTE.
-WHAT?

25:22.477 --> 25:25.001
UNCLE ALEX SAID, "WHY DON'T
WE TAKE THAT PIECE OF GOLD

25:25.132 --> 25:28.309
AND PUT IT IN A POUCH
AND HIDE IT IN A SECRET SPOT

25:28.439 --> 25:30.659
SO THAT NO ONE EVER, EVER
STEALS THAT FROM YOU?"

25:30.790 --> 25:33.009
-DID YOU FIND ONE?
-YEAH, WE DID.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.577
I MEAN, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE IT IS NOW.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.319
I MEAN, THAT WAS YEARS AGO.
IT WAS DOWNRIVER SOMEPLACE.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.364
WELL, COME ON!
LET'S GO LOOK FOR IT.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.279
MAYBE HE HID THE GOLDEN BOOT
THERE. COME ON.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.499
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
HOBIE. SIT DOWN.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.457
I TELL YOU WHAT,
TOMORROW MORNING

25:46.588 --> 25:48.329
WHEN EDDIE AND SHAUNI GET HERE,

25:48.459 --> 25:51.680
WE'LL GO DOWNRIVER, AND WE'LL
LOOK FOR THAT SECRET SPOT.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.726
-ALL RIGHT.
-TRY IT. IT'S READY.

25:53.856 --> 25:56.859
-OKAY.
-IT'S HOT. DON'T BURN YOURSELF.

26:19.447 --> 26:20.361
HEY, HOBIE?

26:29.979 --> 26:32.025
YOU'RE SWIRLING IT
TOO FAST, SON.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.463
YOU GOT TO SCOOP UP
A PAN OF SPRING,

26:35.594 --> 26:37.160
COME UP STRAIGHT UP WITH IT,

26:38.031 --> 26:39.423
AND GET BETWEEN YOU AND THE SUN,

26:39.554 --> 26:42.513
AND SWIRL THE SLAG OFF
NICE AND SLOW

26:42.644 --> 26:45.125
UNTIL YOU SEE GOLD
KICKING UP LIGHT.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.475
WOW. THANKS.

26:48.476 --> 26:49.346
YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.522
YOU GOT A NAME?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.742
-HOBIE BUCHANNON.
-BUCHANNON?

26:54.134 --> 26:56.049
GOOD NAME.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.659
YOU AND YOUR OLD MAN PLANNING
TO GO DOWNRIVER TODAY, ARE YOU?

26:58.138 --> 27:00.096
I HOPE SO. I DON'T KNOW.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.794
HOBIE? HOBIE, WHERE ARE YOU?

27:02.446 --> 27:03.796
I'M OVER HERE, DAD!

27:04.710 --> 27:05.580
HEY, HOBIE!

27:08.452 --> 27:10.193
-WHAT'S GOING ON?
-THIS GUY'S TEACHING ME

27:10.324 --> 27:11.630
HOW TO PAN FOR GOLD.

27:12.456 --> 27:13.327
WHAT GUY?

27:15.764 --> 27:16.939
HE WAS HERE A SECOND AGO.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.681
COME ON,
LET'S GET BREAKFAST, HUH?

27:19.812 --> 27:21.248
YEAH, OKAY.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.742
I TOLD YOU
WE WERE GOING TO BE LATE.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.395
HONEY, DO I LOOK ALL RIGHT?

27:38.526 --> 27:39.832
THIS DRESS, IS IT TOO TIGHT?

27:40.615 --> 27:42.530
MOM, LOOK HOW BUFF
THESE PEOPLE ARE.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.315
THEY'VE PROBABLY BEEN SWIMMING
IN THE OCEAN THEIR WHOLE LIFE.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.143
I NEVER EVEN SAW IT
UNTIL YESTERDAY.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.189
YOU KNOW, I WORE THIS DRESS
WHEN I SANG

27:49.319 --> 27:51.626
AT THE CITY BOWL LOUNGE,
AND IT WENT OVER REALLY BIG.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.584
I MIGHT AS WELL
NOT EVEN SIGN UP.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.674
THEY'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO HATE IT.

27:56.849 --> 27:57.893
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.330
-YOU'LL DO GREAT.
-KNOCK 'EM DEAD.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.505
MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.203
-LOVE YOU!
-LOVE YOU!

28:04.465 --> 28:06.423
OKAY, BABY. GO GET 'EM.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.126
WHICH ONE OF THESE GUYS
IS QUINN?

28:13.692 --> 28:15.998
I'VE BEEN CHECKING IT OUT.
I DON'T THINK HE SHOWED UP YET.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.002
SO, DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ROOKIES

28:20.133 --> 28:21.525
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS YEAR?

28:21.656 --> 28:23.527
TEN. MAYBE 12.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.226
-THAT'S IT?
-YEAH.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.710
WELL, HOW DO THEY DECIDE
WHO'S GOING TO--

28:31.840 --> 28:33.842
THEY HAVE TESTING, INTERVIEWS--

28:33.973 --> 28:35.539
MOSTLY IT'S JUST
THE STRONGEST SWIMMERS

28:35.670 --> 28:37.280
THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT
IN THE ROOKIE SCHOOL.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.718
BUT THEN ONLY HALF OF THOSE
ARE GOING TO MAKE IT OUT.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.286
HELL, I KNEW IT WOULD BE
SING OR SWIM.

28:43.896 --> 28:44.810
JED.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.944
SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WANTS
TO RUN OFF CHASING THEIR DREAMS.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.468
WELL, I CHASED MINE
CLEAR CROSS-COUNTRY.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.993
NOW THAT I'VE CAUGHT IT, I AIN'T
NEVER LETTING IT GO, BABY.

28:54.123 --> 28:56.473
JED, MY MOTHER DOESN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU ANYMORE.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.345
WELL, THEN
WON'T SHE BE SURPRISED?

28:59.041 --> 29:01.261
NOW, WHERE'D YOU PARK
THE TRAILER? SOMEWHERE NEARBY?

29:01.870 --> 29:04.481
COME ON, I'LL DRIVE YOU.
WE'LL WAIT TILL SHE GETS HOME.

29:04.612 --> 29:06.657
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE US ALONE?

29:07.963 --> 29:09.791
-HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
-WANT ME TO BUTT IN OR OUT?

29:09.922 --> 29:11.227
IN.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.447
THIS HAS GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.667
IT DOES NOW. IT'S GOT TO DO
WITH ME AND ALL MY BUDDIES HERE.

29:16.798 --> 29:17.886
WE'LL BACK YOU UP, MAN.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.629
YOU TELL JACKIE
I'M HERE TO STAY.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.894
WHO THE HELL IS THAT DORK?

29:26.025 --> 29:27.853
THAT WAS
MY MOTHER'S EX-BOYFRIEND.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.074
