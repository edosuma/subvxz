01:02.836 --> 01:04.580
Topher, we got you. Okay?
We're here.

01:04.754 --> 01:08.338
Come on, Toph. Toph?
Come on, Toph.

01:08.509 --> 01:09.540
Stay with me, buddy.

01:09.718 --> 01:11.794
- It's okay. We got you.
- Make some room.

01:13.180 --> 01:15.256
Everybody, come on. Out of the way.

01:16.391 --> 01:18.929
I know. We will get to you.
We'll get to you and you.

01:19.102 --> 01:22.637
I know this is hard, and I can only
imagine what you are going through.

01:22.814 --> 01:25.685
We are trying everything we can
to identify who is here.

01:25.859 --> 01:29.109
The victims have been spread out
across several hospitals.

01:29.279 --> 01:32.897
So if you just bear with us, the nurses
will take down your information...

01:33.075 --> 01:35.400
and we will let you know
what we know. Okay?

01:35.577 --> 01:37.237
- We need to know something.
- Thank you.

01:37.412 --> 01:39.322
We're standing here for nothing.

01:39.498 --> 01:40.577
- What a mess.
- Yeah.

01:40.749 --> 01:42.872
Everybody needs an answer.
How's Topher?

01:43.043 --> 01:46.578
Not looking good. TC's with him,
and Scott's on his way in.

01:46.755 --> 01:49.756
I got off the phone with Dwayne's
family. They'll be here soon.

01:49.925 --> 01:52.416
And when I'm done,
I'll come back and help you here.

01:52.594 --> 01:54.717
Okay. Thanks. That would be great.

01:55.389 --> 01:58.888
Mr. Ragosa,
we've cleared everything.

01:59.059 --> 02:01.550
Detective Gonzalez
is gonna run point from here.

02:01.728 --> 02:03.638
- He's with the shooter right now.
- Okay.

02:03.814 --> 02:07.265
- Wish it would've played out differently.
- Thank you for all your help.

02:11.321 --> 02:13.647
Need eight units of B-positive,
typed and crossed

02:13.824 --> 02:16.196
Kenny, send a trauma panel.
Set up for intubation.

02:16.368 --> 02:18.491
- Call Scott?
- On his way. Ten minutes out.

02:18.662 --> 02:20.702
Call his wife, Janet.
She needs to be here.

02:20.873 --> 02:22.580
- I'm on it.
- Stay with me, buddy.

02:22.749 --> 02:24.707
Grabbing a central-line kit.

02:27.004 --> 02:28.498
Hand me Mac three.

02:28.672 --> 02:32.290
Can't help but think maybe if I'd figured
out what you were trying to say...

02:32.467 --> 02:33.843
No, you couldn't have known.

02:34.011 --> 02:36.253
Maybe Topher isn't shot
because you were protecting me.

02:36.430 --> 02:38.506
I was never gonna lose you.
Guy's a scumbag.

02:38.682 --> 02:39.927
Shot Dwayne in cold blood.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.805
You are not responsible for any of this.
You understand?

02:42.978 --> 02:47.391
Guys, this is gonna be awkward,
but the shooter needs medical attention.

02:47.566 --> 02:49.190
- Screw him.
- That's too bad.

02:49.359 --> 02:51.435
- I know how you feel.
- No, you don't.

02:51.612 --> 02:54.566
You're right. I don't.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.531
- But we have to treat him.
- Send Drew.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.942
Drew is overwhelmed
with the factory victims.

02:59.119 --> 03:01.610
Paul and Krista are too inexperienced
to do it alone.

03:01.788 --> 03:04.955
Look. Under normal circumstances,
I'd be sending you home, Jordan.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.616
You're the attending.
You have to do this.

03:09.463 --> 03:12.333
I'm okay here. Scott's on his way in.

03:12.508 --> 03:15.758
Just get it over and done with.
Come back here.

03:20.098 --> 03:22.768
- Another factory victim.
- Female with full-body burns.

03:22.935 --> 03:24.678
BP 60 systolic. Oxygen is low.

03:24.853 --> 03:27.391
Trauma 3, right here.
Krista, Paul, you're with me.

03:27.564 --> 03:30.020
Gave her a dose of morphine
for the pain.

03:30.192 --> 03:33.359
Okay, get ready.
Very careful, people. On my count.

03:33.529 --> 03:36.316
One, two, three.

03:37.574 --> 03:40.611
- Paul, I need you to come with me.
- Yeah.

03:40.786 --> 03:42.825
- Hey, how's Toph?
- He's not good.

03:42.996 --> 03:45.203
But TC's with him
and Scott's on his way.

03:45.624 --> 03:47.166
Let's go.

03:50.504 --> 03:53.540
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- Thank you.

03:53.715 --> 03:55.507
It really hurts, my neck.

03:55.676 --> 03:57.384
- I bet it does.
- It really hurts.

03:57.553 --> 04:00.257
- Shut up.
- Detective Gonzalez, S.A.P.D.

04:00.430 --> 04:03.431
You got anything I can feed my boss
on Milo's condition?

04:03.600 --> 04:06.387
Yeah. It looks like a blunt trauma
to the neck, zone two.

04:06.562 --> 04:09.765
From Dr. Callahan's struggle. Right?
How did that go down?

04:10.107 --> 04:13.392
He had a gun pointed at me.
He was gonna take me with him.

04:13.569 --> 04:14.944
TC stopped him.

04:15.112 --> 04:18.029
Ballsy guy, and a little reckless.
We were about to come in.

04:18.197 --> 04:20.154
We didn't know you were out there.

04:20.617 --> 04:22.028
What do you think?

04:22.202 --> 04:24.029
I think TC did the right thing.

04:24.454 --> 04:26.032
About this guy.

04:26.206 --> 04:29.907
Right. We need a scan to look
for a carotid-artery injury.

04:30.085 --> 04:32.161
He may need a stent
or surgical repair.

04:32.337 --> 04:35.042
Exactly. So get a scan of his neck.

04:35.215 --> 04:38.300
If it comes back positive,
you put him in the queue for surgery.

04:38.468 --> 04:39.927
But he has to wait.

04:40.095 --> 04:42.586
Just to be clear,
Milo is gonna be a key witness...

04:42.764 --> 04:45.765
in a few other cases,
so it's important you keep him alive.

04:45.934 --> 04:49.184
We needed Dwayne alive.
We need Topher alive.

04:49.354 --> 04:53.019
And all those people that did nothing
but got caught in an explosion...

04:53.192 --> 04:54.734
they need to be alive too.

04:54.902 --> 04:57.227
So he can wait
behind the rest of them.

04:57.404 --> 04:58.815
No.

04:58.989 --> 05:01.480
Is she really the only doctor?

05:02.367 --> 05:06.614
For those of you coming in to help,
thank you very much. Thank you.

05:07.331 --> 05:10.035
Now, I know you all are worried.

05:10.209 --> 05:13.874
Okay? But Topher, he was wounded,
and he's in surgery.

05:14.213 --> 05:18.424
And I'm very sad to inform you,
but Dwayne, he was shot.

05:18.592 --> 05:20.501
He didn't make it.

05:21.762 --> 05:24.383
Again, this has been a brutal night,
but it's not over.

05:24.556 --> 05:26.679
Let's say a prayer
for Dwayne and Topher...

05:26.850 --> 05:29.341
and let's get back
to what we have to do.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.141
We'll get through this together.
Thank you.

05:33.232 --> 05:37.064
- All right. Jordan, you okay?
- I'm fine. We'll talk later.

05:37.236 --> 05:39.905
- What have we got?
- Single GSW to the abdomen.

05:40.072 --> 05:43.737
Pressure's borderline. FAST scans
reveal blood pooling behind the liver.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.783
- I suspect an IBC.
- Pressure's dropping.

05:45.953 --> 05:47.910
- No time for scanning, he needs OR.
- Yep.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.164
- Systolic 40. Must be bleeding.
- Type and cross for eight units.

05:51.333 --> 05:55.165
We just gotta get that bullet out.
Scott, I'll be scrubbing in with you.

05:55.796 --> 05:57.623
- Hit the elevator.
- What happened?

05:57.798 --> 05:59.755
- Everybody, move.
- Get the elevator door.

06:01.134 --> 06:02.677
- Out of the way.
- Move. Move.

06:24.199 --> 06:26.441
Pressure's down to 60.

06:26.869 --> 06:29.538
Still can't see what's bleeding.

06:30.581 --> 06:32.123
Little more retraction, please.

06:36.420 --> 06:40.003
Okay. I need you place a running
suture right beneath my clamp there.

06:40.174 --> 06:41.549
What a mess.

06:51.185 --> 06:53.676
Hey, Toph.
This son of a bitch here is my brother...

06:53.854 --> 06:56.060
and platoon leader,
Captain Thad Callahan.

06:56.231 --> 06:58.105
You forgot about tougher, cooler...

06:58.275 --> 07:00.731
better-looking,
kicked your ass a million times.

07:00.903 --> 07:03.228
The placement's good.
You can cut the suture now.

07:03.405 --> 07:05.730
- TC. TC.
- Yeah?

07:05.908 --> 07:08.862
- Suture.
- Yeah. I got it. I got it.

07:09.036 --> 07:10.578
I got it.

07:11.788 --> 07:14.326
Identity patients
as soon as they've been admitted.

07:14.499 --> 07:16.291
If the patient is unresponsive...

07:16.460 --> 07:19.793
find some ID or anything that can
help identify them to loved ones.

07:19.963 --> 07:22.537
We're cross-referencing
with the other area hospitals.

07:22.716 --> 07:24.673
- Perfect.
- Is there any word on Topher?

07:25.093 --> 07:28.712
He's still in surgery. I'll make an
announcement soon as I hear anything.

07:28.889 --> 07:32.388
- Thanks.
- I just checked in. It's still touch and go.

07:32.976 --> 07:35.930
Shooter's scan came back positive.
Small tear in the carotid.

07:36.104 --> 07:37.349
Are his vitals stable?

07:37.523 --> 07:39.681
For now.
There's a hematoma plugging the hole.

07:39.858 --> 07:42.065
- I'll get him to the OR.
- No. ORs are full...

07:42.236 --> 07:45.651
so he'll wait for Interventional
Radiology for an endoscopic repair.

07:46.490 --> 07:47.735
Jordan.

07:47.908 --> 07:50.613
I know this is a difficult situation...

07:50.786 --> 07:52.778
but treat him
like every other patient.

07:52.955 --> 07:55.991
- He's not every other patient.
- I hired you as interim chief...

07:56.166 --> 07:58.836
because you do the right thing.
I know it's not easy.

07:59.586 --> 08:01.330
Especially in this case.

08:01.505 --> 08:03.082
But it's the job.

08:07.761 --> 08:10.217
- Paul?
- Yeah.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.058
Do an OR setup.
I'm gonna repair the artery myself.

08:13.225 --> 08:15.798
- In the trauma room? Down here?
- Surgeons are swamped.

08:15.978 --> 08:19.726
IR is gonna take forever.
It's temporary, but it will save his life.

08:19.898 --> 08:21.891
The hematoma won't be a Band-Aid
for long.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.645
- Okay.
- Thank you.

08:25.237 --> 08:27.810
<i>Dr. Sarah Dovitch, 5762.</i>

08:34.663 --> 08:35.693
Got it.

08:35.873 --> 08:37.948
Just missed the aorta.

08:39.793 --> 08:43.208
All right. Let's place another silk.
Sponge stick, please.

08:43.380 --> 08:46.583
Repair is done.
Time to remove this clamp.

08:46.758 --> 08:48.087
Moment of truth.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.965
Sutures are holding.
Field remaining dry.

08:51.138 --> 08:53.843
TC, I can get him closed up
if you wanna take a break.

08:54.016 --> 08:55.889
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fine.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.977
Okay. Good.

09:00.939 --> 09:03.609
We got her intubated.
Now let's get her some relief.

09:03.775 --> 09:05.815
Start her
on Q 15-minute Dilaudid pushes...

09:05.986 --> 09:08.691
and she needs
aggressive fluid resuscitation.

09:08.864 --> 09:11.485
- Krista? You with me?
- Yeah.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.111
Just with Topher in the OR...

09:17.789 --> 09:18.952
and Dwayne.

09:19.124 --> 09:22.825
It's terrible, and we wanna be out there
helping Topher, but we're in here.

09:23.003 --> 09:25.494
I don't wanna be a hard-ass,
but you gotta focus.

09:26.048 --> 09:27.079
Okay.

09:27.841 --> 09:28.872
Okay.

09:29.051 --> 09:31.624
How's he doing?
He's gonna make it. Right?

09:31.803 --> 09:34.176
He's lost a lot of blood,
but we're almost done.

09:36.517 --> 09:38.177
Release the proximal clamp.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.141
Whoa, it's not holding.

09:41.313 --> 09:43.187
It's fine. It needs an extra suture.

09:43.357 --> 09:46.026
- Need help? Should I call Dr. Clemmens?
- I got it. Okay?

09:46.193 --> 09:48.316
Everybody just...
Paul, watch what I do.

09:49.112 --> 09:52.113
Add another suture, and tie it off.

09:52.282 --> 09:54.690
Now remove the clamp.

09:54.868 --> 09:57.406
See? It's all under control.

09:57.579 --> 10:00.249
When we're finished,
feel free to put his cuffs back on.

10:00.415 --> 10:02.159
He'll be awake shortly and in pain.

10:02.334 --> 10:03.365
No skin off my nose.

10:03.544 --> 10:05.536
Look. I've done my job,
now you do yours.

10:05.712 --> 10:07.337
No deals. He goes to prison.

10:07.923 --> 10:09.203
Count on it.

10:11.635 --> 10:14.885
<i>Reporting live from Selma,
where a deadly fertiliser explosion...</i>

10:15.055 --> 10:18.389
<i>has claimed the lives of at least
two people and injured many more.</i>

10:19.768 --> 10:22.093
<i>Emergency responders
are still rescuing people...</i>

10:22.271 --> 10:23.599
<i>from inside the building.</i>

10:23.772 --> 10:26.477
<i>Victims are being taken
to a number of local hospitals...</i>

10:26.650 --> 10:28.310
<i>including San Antonio Memorial.</i>

10:28.485 --> 10:31.107
All I've heard was that
Topher just got out of surgery.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.071
Haven't been
any complications so far.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.157
- Thank you. Keep the updates coming.
- You got it.

10:38.453 --> 10:41.027
Topher. Topher.

10:41.999 --> 10:43.327
Topher.

10:46.253 --> 10:50.582
- You're not gonna kiss me, are you?
- Just try and stop me.

10:54.136 --> 10:57.968
- So all things considered, you're...
- Yeah.

10:59.766 --> 11:02.092
- Dwayne, man...
- Yeah. That's a...

11:02.269 --> 11:03.467
I can't believe it.

11:03.645 --> 11:06.136
That's gonna be a hard one to forget.

11:06.315 --> 11:07.975
- How's Jordan?
- Shaken.

11:08.150 --> 11:09.941
She had to work on Milo.

11:10.444 --> 11:12.401
- What?
- Carotid injury.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.564
You know, I wish...
I wish I'd killed him.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.946
I wish you'd killed him
before he shot me.

11:17.117 --> 11:19.952
I have three kids.
That scared the crap out of me, man.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.994
I almost pissed myself.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.539
Yeah.

11:23.874 --> 11:26.447
And then those flash bangs...

11:26.627 --> 11:29.996
it kind of took me back to the war,
you know?

11:30.380 --> 11:32.172
<i>Down. Down.</i>

11:32.341 --> 11:35.923
You ever think about
that sniper that shot Thad?

11:37.763 --> 11:40.218
Get a hemostat
and try to clamp off the bleeder.

11:40.390 --> 11:42.466
Right. Right, right.

11:44.061 --> 11:46.516
I try not to think about anything
about that day.

11:46.688 --> 11:47.886
Yeah.

11:48.899 --> 11:50.690
Do you?

11:51.276 --> 11:52.439
T?

11:53.779 --> 11:56.270
It just keeps popping in my head.

11:58.825 --> 11:59.857
<i>And I just...</i>

12:00.744 --> 12:01.859
<i>- I just...</i>
- T.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.035
<i>T?</i>

12:07.251 --> 12:09.492
- T.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:09.670 --> 12:11.045
You just what?

12:11.463 --> 12:12.957
- Just...
- Oh, Topher.

12:13.131 --> 12:14.674
- Hey.
- Toph.

12:15.008 --> 12:18.175
It's okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.427
I don't understand.
How did this happen?

12:20.597 --> 12:23.515
Topher will explain everything.
You guys need to talk, Janet.

12:23.684 --> 12:26.056
He's gonna be fine.
I took the bullet out myself.

12:26.228 --> 12:29.182
Toph, there's extra morphine
in the PCA machine. You just...

12:29.356 --> 12:30.519
- You... You enjoy.
- T.

12:31.275 --> 12:32.437
T.

12:34.403 --> 12:36.691
I can't imagine
the recovery process for this.

12:36.864 --> 12:38.026
There isn't one.

12:38.198 --> 12:41.816
When I was a medic in Iraq,
an IED went off, killed three guys.

12:41.994 --> 12:45.113
One guy survived, except the right side
of his body was burned...

12:45.289 --> 12:46.949
all the way down to the muscle.

12:47.124 --> 12:50.623
Lot of skin grafts,
lot of plastic surgery and a lot of pain.

12:50.794 --> 12:52.336
- Oh, God.
- So let's just focus...

12:52.504 --> 12:54.829
on making her comfortable
and easing her pain.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.999
Just one step at a time.

13:00.345 --> 13:02.919
That was dispatch.
Secondary explosion at the factory.

13:03.098 --> 13:06.099
They're trying to triage on-site,
but they're requesting help.

13:06.268 --> 13:08.806
- We're already stretched thin.
- I got it. I can go.

13:08.979 --> 13:11.137
Topher's fine. Just saw him.
Spread the word.

13:11.315 --> 13:13.556
- Hey, T. Can we talk for a second?
- Yeah.

13:14.026 --> 13:17.525
Look. The only place that you
should be going right now is home.

13:17.696 --> 13:21.445
- You've been through a lot tonight.
- Yeah. So have you, but you're here.

13:21.617 --> 13:23.761
- The shooter gonna make it?
- He's stable. Don't change the subject.

13:23.785 --> 13:26.276
I'm fine. Been through worse.
I'm anxious to get out.

13:26.455 --> 13:28.697
I don't wanna be late
and have it on my hands.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.154
- Okay?
- No, T...

13:30.334 --> 13:32.872
You have a day-shifter coming,
people here to help...

13:33.045 --> 13:36.211
but no one out there who can do
what I do. You know I'm right.

13:36.381 --> 13:38.125
Mollie, tell them I'm on my way.

13:42.095 --> 13:43.175
Drew.

13:44.932 --> 13:47.802
- Can Krista handle the debriding?
- Yeah. She's got it down.

13:47.976 --> 13:50.183
There was another explosion.
TC is on his way.

13:50.354 --> 13:53.853
I need you to go
and keep an eye on him. He's just...

13:54.024 --> 13:55.399
He's way too jacked up.

13:55.567 --> 13:56.848
- You got it.
- Thank you.

13:57.027 --> 13:58.936
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

13:59.112 --> 14:01.319
I am. I'm fine.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.399
- Jordan.
- Yeah?

14:04.034 --> 14:05.445
How you holding up?

14:05.619 --> 14:08.240
Just focused on getting
to the end of the shift.

14:08.413 --> 14:10.821
- Why don't you go home?
- Would you?

14:10.999 --> 14:14.368
Scott, this is my ER. Okay?
We're understaffed as it is. I'm staying.

14:14.545 --> 14:17.000
Okay. I just... I had to ask.

14:17.256 --> 14:18.584
I'm headed back to surgery.

14:18.757 --> 14:22.340
Can I borrow your intern Paul
to do a post-op eval on Topher?

14:22.511 --> 14:24.669
- Might go better with a friendly face.
- Sure.

14:24.847 --> 14:26.720
I'll send him up
when things slow down.

14:26.890 --> 14:29.381
Page me if you need me for anything.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.932
- I will.
- I love you.

14:32.688 --> 14:34.561
I love you too.

14:41.697 --> 14:43.274
T, you ready? Let's go.

14:43.949 --> 14:45.324
T.

14:45.492 --> 14:46.737
<i>T, we gotta go.</i>

14:48.662 --> 14:50.655
- TC, come on. We gotta go.
- Yeah.

14:50.831 --> 14:53.452
- Let's go. The truck's ready.
- Are you okay?

14:53.625 --> 14:55.036
- Yeah.
- I'm going with you.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.582
Just figured I could use
the excitement. Come on.

14:57.754 --> 14:59.794
Let's go, doctors.
We don't have all night.

15:07.472 --> 15:09.512
Go ahead.
Towards the back over there.

15:11.768 --> 15:15.220
- Grab an extra C-collar.
- Okay. Lift it. Does it hurt?

15:15.480 --> 15:16.939
How about that?

15:17.232 --> 15:19.106
Okay. Here we go.

15:19.484 --> 15:20.979
Roger that. Squad 52...

15:21.153 --> 15:23.822
Get the less severe injuries
off to University Hospital.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.732
Make sure to label before you ship.

15:25.908 --> 15:28.743
Write their conditions and their vitals
on their right arm.

15:28.911 --> 15:31.236
More severe injuries
are to be stabilised here...

15:31.413 --> 15:32.872
before being transported.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.365
This guy's ready.
Clean him, get him to hospital.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.701
We got a woman in there.
Pinned under a beam.

15:37.878 --> 15:40.547
My guys are trying to get her,
her breathing's laboured.

15:40.714 --> 15:42.707
- Two-man job.
- Yeah. Okay. Take us to her.

15:42.883 --> 15:46.631
You'll be masked. You got five minutes
before this thing starts coming down.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.970
I think we can handle it.

15:54.228 --> 15:56.386
It hurts really bad.

15:56.563 --> 15:58.639
I need something for the pain.

15:58.815 --> 16:02.647
That's too bad. And you know,
it's probably just gonna get worse.

16:02.819 --> 16:05.986
Please. I get it. You hate me.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.772
You get it? You murdered a man.

16:08.951 --> 16:12.818
You were probably gonna kill me,
and you almost killed one of my friends.

16:13.247 --> 16:17.790
The only reason that I fixed you up
is because it's my job.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.118
I hope that you live
to be 100 years old...

16:20.295 --> 16:23.960
and you spend every day in prison
because that is what you deserve.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.758
So no.

16:27.052 --> 16:30.421
No. You don't get
any pain medication.

16:30.597 --> 16:33.598
You can lie here and suffer
for all I care.

16:35.394 --> 16:37.054
How's he doing?

16:37.688 --> 16:39.265
He's fine.

16:39.439 --> 16:42.109
Oh, come on.

16:44.403 --> 16:47.653
We just had our fourth victim
pass away from the accident tonight.

16:47.823 --> 16:50.065
- File says Joshua Gomez.
- Oh, my God.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.484
I just spoke with his mother.

16:53.370 --> 16:57.450
I hate this. It's like you never get
to tell them any good news.

16:57.624 --> 16:59.284
I'll do it with you.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.295
Okay.

17:02.462 --> 17:05.036
<i>- Which puts the number of fatalities
at eight now.</i>

17:05.214 --> 17:07.457
<i>Still dozens more injured
and being treated.</i>

17:07.634 --> 17:10.339
<i>- Victims are being identified...</i>
- Ms. Gomez?

17:10.971 --> 17:13.260
<i>You can check the website
or call the number...</i>

17:13.432 --> 17:15.555
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

17:15.726 --> 17:19.806
Your son Joshua, he suffered
severe trauma from the explosion...

17:19.980 --> 17:22.732
- and he died.
- No.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.477
I'm so sorry.

17:25.569 --> 17:27.941
No.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.356
No.

17:42.836 --> 17:44.793
She's over here.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.084
She's trapped under the debris.

17:48.258 --> 17:49.752
She's having trouble breathing.

17:49.927 --> 17:51.836
She can't get any oxygen
from the mask.

17:54.806 --> 17:56.680
Over here.

18:04.816 --> 18:07.936
Her airway's almost closed shut.
This oxygen ain't doing crap.

18:08.111 --> 18:11.397
Okay. Drew, we need to do a crike.
Prep her neck.

18:12.658 --> 18:16.240
- You gotta put the mask back on.
- I can't see a thing through that mask.

18:17.204 --> 18:18.947
Move. Come on.

18:21.291 --> 18:24.209
We have to get everyone
out of here, doc.

18:26.296 --> 18:27.790
Let's go. Come on.

18:27.965 --> 18:30.253
The structure's unstable.
It's going to shift.

18:30.425 --> 18:31.623
You in?

18:32.719 --> 18:34.546
Okay. I'm in. I'm in. Okay. Let's go.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.027
T. TC, we done here? We gotta go.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.687
They're talking about
a possible gas leak.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.651
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let's go.

19:02.124 --> 19:03.701
- What the hell you doing?
- Just...

19:03.876 --> 19:06.545
Well, Dr. Clemmens told me
to put in the catheter.

19:06.920 --> 19:10.455
Told you, or told you to tell a nurse?

19:10.632 --> 19:14.251
Told me to tell a nurse.
I... I just thought, you know?

19:14.428 --> 19:16.385
Have you ever done
one of these before?

19:16.555 --> 19:19.224
Sure. Yeah. On a... On a cadaver.

19:21.101 --> 19:22.975
Well, you're not doing one on me.

19:23.145 --> 19:25.718
- Did you want me to grab a nurse or?
- No need.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.389
There is no way
I'm getting a catheter.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.227
It's not gonna happen, so...

19:30.944 --> 19:32.771
On your way.

19:34.114 --> 19:36.522
Keep going. Out.

19:39.703 --> 19:42.194
Let me check her tube,
make sure it's secure.

19:42.372 --> 19:44.745
T, you wanna...? T?

19:45.751 --> 19:47.660
Get her to the rig.

19:48.170 --> 19:49.913
T.

19:52.716 --> 19:55.752
T? TC.

19:57.221 --> 19:59.297
T, where are you?

20:00.349 --> 20:02.009
T, we gotta get out of here now.

20:03.393 --> 20:04.936
T.

20:14.363 --> 20:16.439
T, what the hell are you doing?

20:16.615 --> 20:19.402
- I heard somebody yell.
- Where?

20:19.576 --> 20:22.281
I thought I heard someone.
I gotta find them.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.494
- Building's clear.
- I gotta get in there.

20:24.665 --> 20:27.582
No one's here. It's gonna collapse.
We gotta get out of here.

20:27.751 --> 20:29.542
- Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.965
Her O2 is dropping.

20:42.516 --> 20:44.425
- She's not moving air.
- What's going on?

20:44.601 --> 20:47.388
The burnt skin is too tight.
She can't expand her lungs.

20:47.563 --> 20:50.350
- She needs an escharotomy. Clear.
- Clear.

20:50.524 --> 20:53.441
My hands are full. You have to do it.
Ever done one before?

20:53.610 --> 20:56.611
- I've seen videos.
- Make incision through the chest wall.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.318
It'll allow soft tissue to expand
so she can breathe.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.945
- Go assist her.
- Got it.

21:01.118 --> 21:02.660
Clear.

21:03.370 --> 21:04.698
All right, guys. Here we go.

21:07.624 --> 21:10.411
Krista, I've seen you do
some pretty badass things.

21:10.586 --> 21:12.993
You pulled a fork out
of a girl's throat tonight.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.334
- Yeah.
- Push another epi.

21:14.506 --> 21:15.835
- You got this.
- She's ready.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.502
Right up.

21:17.718 --> 21:19.627
Charging.

21:21.221 --> 21:23.048
Clear.

21:23.432 --> 21:24.511
It's working.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.225
She's breathing.

21:26.643 --> 21:29.644
- Her O2 is rising.
- Oh, God. It's really working.

21:29.813 --> 21:31.224
Nice job, Krista.

21:33.483 --> 21:34.598
Thanks, Kenny.

21:35.402 --> 21:37.525
Never had a doubt.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.023
Now we'll just have to ID her.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.275
Excuse me. Can you help me?

21:43.076 --> 21:46.113
- Are you here to see a doctor, or are...?
- My wife, Susan.

21:46.288 --> 21:48.281
She was working
at the factory tonight.

21:48.457 --> 21:50.746
I've been trying to call her
since the accident.

21:50.918 --> 21:54.084
- University said to check here.
- Okay. Let's get some information.

21:54.254 --> 21:57.255
- She's gotta be okay. It's all my fault.
- How?

21:57.424 --> 22:00.674
I always bring her her lunch mid-shift,
but I was late tonight...

22:00.844 --> 22:03.169
she should've been
in the parking lot with me.

22:03.347 --> 22:04.757
Okay. Just give me your name.

22:04.932 --> 22:07.683
Yeah. Max Leonard.
The one night I'm late...

22:07.851 --> 22:10.603
Anything about your wife
that might help track her down?

22:10.771 --> 22:13.725
She's about 5'5".
Blond hair, blue eyes.

22:13.899 --> 22:14.978
Let's see, what else?

22:15.150 --> 22:18.068
Got a little green fairy
tattooed on the inside of her wrist.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.858
I told her it was silly,
but she loves <i>Moulin Rouge.</i>

22:21.031 --> 22:22.146
It's okay.

22:22.324 --> 22:25.859
Have a seat in the waiting room.
I'll find you soon as I know something.

22:26.036 --> 22:28.609
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

22:28.789 --> 22:31.410
<i>Paging Dr. De la Cruz
to Patient Services.</i>

22:31.583 --> 22:32.781
<i>Dr. De la Cruz...</i>

22:33.502 --> 22:35.245
Thanks.

22:39.758 --> 22:42.166
I said no catheter.

22:42.344 --> 22:44.835
Scott says if you can urinate,
you don't need one.

22:45.013 --> 22:48.133
Tell Scott if he wants a catheter
so damn bad...

22:48.308 --> 22:50.218
he can stick up his own penis.

22:50.394 --> 22:52.433
I... I can't tell him that.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.561
Just give me the bottle and leave.

22:54.731 --> 22:58.729
Actually, he's gonna want proof.
I kind of have to stay.

22:58.902 --> 23:00.942
I cannot do it with you watching.

23:01.405 --> 23:02.899
Step outside or something.

23:03.073 --> 23:05.991
Yeah. If I leave,
you're just gonna lie about it, and...

23:06.159 --> 23:08.651
How will I lie?
There will be no urine in the bottle.

23:11.582 --> 23:12.910
Can you get me some water?

23:13.083 --> 23:14.957
But are you sure that's a good idea?

23:15.127 --> 23:16.787
Are you telling me what to do?

23:17.171 --> 23:19.080
No. I... I wasn't...

23:20.632 --> 23:23.419
Actually, yes.
I'm the doctor, and you're the patient.

23:23.844 --> 23:26.465
Normally, you may be my boss,
but you aren't right now.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.425
You get backed up,
you develop urosepsis or renal failure.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.676
So I'm gonna grab you
a glass of water.

23:31.852 --> 23:36.063
Now, if it does not work, I'm getting
a nurse to put in the catheter.

23:36.982 --> 23:38.642
Okay, doctor.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.644
You make an excellent point.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.061
That's exactly how I would've said it.

23:43.447 --> 23:45.736
Can you get me some water, please?

23:45.908 --> 23:47.651
Yes, sir.

23:50.787 --> 23:52.745
You want me
to leave the water running?

23:52.915 --> 23:56.864
Sometimes that helps when I can't go.
I guess just makes it happen.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.202
Did not need that visual.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.416
Dr. Clemmens.

24:03.634 --> 24:04.962
Hey, I just...

24:05.135 --> 24:08.718
I wanted to thank you again
for getting me in to see Dr. Clodfelter.

24:08.889 --> 24:10.882
Glad to do it.
Best ocular surgeon I know.

24:11.266 --> 24:12.760
He ran some tests on me.

24:12.935 --> 24:16.054
They'll probably be able to get me in
for eye surgery next month.

24:16.230 --> 24:19.433
That's great news. I know this vision
trouble has been a burden.

24:19.608 --> 24:20.639
Yeah.

24:20.817 --> 24:23.190
- Anyway, I'm back up to the OR.
- All right.

24:25.948 --> 24:27.062
Dr. De la Cruz?

24:27.866 --> 24:30.238
You're trying to match patients
to family members?

24:30.410 --> 24:31.490
Do you have something?

24:31.662 --> 24:33.654
This ID was with the woman
in Trauma 3.

24:33.830 --> 24:36.915
She's very badly burned.
It was in her jacket.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.827
I just found it.

24:42.881 --> 24:46.546
<i>All available surgical interns,
please report to the OR.</i>

24:46.718 --> 24:49.126
<i>All available surgical interns,
please report...</i>

24:53.809 --> 24:55.636
Oh, my God.

24:55.811 --> 24:59.346
Susan. I'm so sorry.

24:59.523 --> 25:01.515
We found her name tag
with her jacket.

25:01.692 --> 25:03.731
She's intubated,
she won't be able to talk.

25:03.902 --> 25:06.109
- Is she in pain?
- She's heavily medicated.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.364
- Can I touch her?
- Yes, but just try to be gentle.

25:14.788 --> 25:16.247
Oh, my God.

25:16.748 --> 25:18.207
Susan.

25:19.543 --> 25:21.619
Oh, Susan...

25:25.132 --> 25:28.797
That was a great incision you made,
considering you were half-blind.

25:33.348 --> 25:37.013
TC, you want me to take a turn there?
I can step in for you.

25:37.186 --> 25:39.143
No. I got it.

25:43.609 --> 25:46.396
I'm sorry, man.
You did everything you could.

25:48.405 --> 25:51.856
- I thought the captain was dead.
- His brain is gone, but he's pumping...

25:52.034 --> 25:55.699
to keep the heart working
so we can transplant it into Nick.

25:57.539 --> 26:00.789
Dude, why won't you
answer my question?

26:00.959 --> 26:02.122
Why?

26:04.505 --> 26:06.082
T? T.

26:06.256 --> 26:07.287
- Yeah, what?
- You okay?

26:07.466 --> 26:09.542
Yeah. Yeah. We almost there?

26:10.469 --> 26:13.138
- Yeah. We're five minutes out.
- Okay.

26:14.056 --> 26:15.633
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

26:16.016 --> 26:17.759
Nothing at all.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.135
So tell me, how are you doing?

26:21.313 --> 26:24.599
I just keep telling people I'm fine
because I want to be fine.

26:24.775 --> 26:26.933
But I'm having
a really hard time focusing...

26:27.110 --> 26:29.020
and I can't get it out of my head.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.693
Last thing you should do
is get it out your head.

26:31.865 --> 26:34.985
What you need to do
is talk about it and deal with it.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.200
After tonight,
you shouldn't even be here.

26:37.371 --> 26:40.490
I have to be here. I can't just leave.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.287
Everyone that I care about,
they're here.

26:43.460 --> 26:45.951
None of those people
would be judging you, Jordan.

26:46.296 --> 26:47.790
Well, I would judge me.

26:48.090 --> 26:51.091
Honestly, I'm judging myself
about TC right now.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.168
- About what?
- Until I was in that room tonight...

26:54.346 --> 26:56.552
with my life on the line...

26:57.724 --> 27:01.805
I had no idea
what TC went through in that war.

27:01.979 --> 27:04.386
I thought I knew.
I thought I understood.

27:04.565 --> 27:06.107
But I was frustrated with him.

27:06.275 --> 27:09.525
With his anger and his anxiety
and his depression.

27:09.695 --> 27:13.277
And I... I didn't think
that it was ever going to end.

27:13.448 --> 27:18.027
But if I feel this way
after 15 minutes of hell...

27:19.329 --> 27:22.330
what does he feel like
after 15 months?

27:22.499 --> 27:25.998
I tried to talk to him about it before,
but he wouldn't go there.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.414
He never does.

27:28.589 --> 27:31.922
Take a look at the woman in Trauma 3.
Her oxygen levels won't come up.

27:32.092 --> 27:35.259
And I tried to make her
as comfortable as possible, but...

27:35.429 --> 27:36.627
Terrible way to go.

27:36.805 --> 27:39.213
- Is her husband with her?
- Yeah.

27:39.391 --> 27:42.060
- I'll talk to him.
- Thank you.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.516
- All right, let's go.
- Thanks.

27:53.113 --> 27:57.656
Mr. Leonard, I'm so sorry.
All we can do is help her with the pain.

27:58.368 --> 28:02.496
I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

28:02.956 --> 28:07.499
I really, really hate
this part of the job.

28:09.338 --> 28:11.461
Don't ever lose that.

28:12.966 --> 28:14.425
- Dr. Alexander.
- Yeah?

28:14.593 --> 28:16.135
It's the shooter. They need you.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.634
Okay, look. Keep her comfortable.

28:18.805 --> 28:20.264
Yeah.

28:22.726 --> 28:24.054
This is pointless.

28:24.228 --> 28:26.267
Most of his blood's
already on the floor.

28:27.189 --> 28:28.932
I'm calling it.

28:30.025 --> 28:31.270
4:02 a.m.

28:31.777 --> 28:32.891
Got it. 4:02.

28:33.237 --> 28:35.858
He's dead? Why?

28:36.031 --> 28:38.189
Carotid artery burst open.

28:38.367 --> 28:42.316
This man needed to be in IR for a stent
or in the OR with me. The sutures tore.

28:42.496 --> 28:45.995
The hole needed to be repaired
with a Dacron patch.

28:47.543 --> 28:50.034
- What happened?
- Who dropped the ball on this?

28:50.587 --> 28:51.832
He was my patient.

28:52.005 --> 28:54.923
But the field was dry when I closed
him up. I double-checked.

28:55.092 --> 28:56.919
- You said he was stable.
- He was.

28:57.219 --> 29:01.299
You were in the OR, and I didn't think
he was stable enough to wait for IR.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.762
So in other words, you screwed up.

29:14.903 --> 29:18.070
Captain. He didn't make it.

29:19.116 --> 29:22.033
The lady doctor that was in there
with him did the operation.

29:22.202 --> 29:24.740
Sorry, but he should've been
brought up to surgery.

29:24.913 --> 29:28.578
Look. You guys were swamped
upstairs, Scott. I made a tough call.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.123
Well, it was the wrong one.

29:31.503 --> 29:34.753
Look. I know this has been
a hell of a night for you...

29:34.923 --> 29:37.461
but unless someone is crashing
in front of you...

29:37.634 --> 29:39.378
surgery needs to happen
in the OR.

29:39.553 --> 29:41.629
Have someone get me.
I'll come down for you.

29:41.805 --> 29:42.884
- Jordan.
- Yeah.

29:43.056 --> 29:44.800
- You got a second?
- One second. I...

29:48.687 --> 29:50.478
- He's off.
- What happened?

29:50.647 --> 29:53.103
Wish I was wrong.
Figured you sent me for a reason.

29:53.275 --> 29:55.766
- Tell me everything.
- I've never seen him like this.

29:55.944 --> 29:57.273
I've seen others like this.

29:57.446 --> 30:02.072
After the war, he's jumpy, he's sweaty,
he's... He said he heard a voice.

30:02.242 --> 30:03.902
- He said that?
- He could have.

30:04.077 --> 30:07.328
Okay? We were in a building.
It was chaos. He might've heard one.

30:07.497 --> 30:08.696
- Okay.
- I don't think so.

30:08.874 --> 30:12.124
- I should've made him go home.
- That's easier said than done.

30:12.294 --> 30:15.628
I tried to get him to let me
have the patient. Pelvis fracture.

30:15.797 --> 30:18.715
He wasn't having any of it.
He insisted on doing it himself.

30:18.884 --> 30:22.383
Okay. I'm gonna try and talk to him,
but could you please just stand by?

30:22.554 --> 30:25.128
- He's in Trauma 2.
- Thank you.

30:25.307 --> 30:27.216
- Dr. Alexander.
- Yeah?

30:27.392 --> 30:30.393
- Tell me what happened.
- Sorry, this is just not a good time.

30:30.562 --> 30:34.690
You told me he was fine, I told my boss
he was fine, and now the guy's dead.

30:34.858 --> 30:36.815
I need to know why.
This is a major case.

30:36.985 --> 30:38.978
She said it wasn't a good time,
detective.

30:39.154 --> 30:41.396
Doctor, do what you need to do.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.064
Listen. You can talk to her
after her shift. Okay?

30:44.243 --> 30:46.947
Or even better, maybe tomorrow.
She's been through a lot.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.446
The other doctor said
it was a screw-up.

30:49.623 --> 30:51.034
Was it?

30:51.208 --> 30:53.877
Or maybe she wasn't trying
as hard as she could?

30:54.837 --> 30:56.829
You bet your ass I'm gonna find out.

31:01.718 --> 31:04.091
Hey, give me a T-pod
to stabilise her pelvis.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.838
- How's it going?
- It's good.

31:07.224 --> 31:09.715
- Is it?
- Yeah.

31:14.106 --> 31:17.557
- T, step down and let me finish this.
- No. I'm fine.

31:17.734 --> 31:20.901
You are not fine. You are not yourself.
I've seen you like this.

31:21.071 --> 31:22.898
T, please.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.397
Let me help you.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.324
- Do it for me.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.038
Yeah.

31:31.707 --> 31:33.035
I should go check on Topher.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.037
Yeah. That's a good idea.

31:37.212 --> 31:38.956
I'll be up soon.

31:46.263 --> 31:49.217
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. He's fine. He just...

31:49.808 --> 31:54.137
- He needed to take a break, that's all.
- Finally, someone got through to him.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.646
Just so you know, that detective's
on a rampage about what happened.

31:57.816 --> 31:59.892
- It's not a priority right now.
- It will be.

32:00.068 --> 32:03.520
I need to protect you on this one.
Gonna set you up with our lawyer.

32:03.697 --> 32:04.860
This isn't going away.

32:09.912 --> 32:11.489
Is that a fairy?

32:11.955 --> 32:13.497
We get a name on this patient?

32:13.665 --> 32:14.828
I don't know.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.542
Ask Drew.

32:22.049 --> 32:23.128
Landry?

32:23.425 --> 32:25.418
Earlier, you were talking to a man...

32:25.594 --> 32:27.752
who mentioned something
about a tattoo.

32:27.930 --> 32:30.218
That was Max Leonard.
We already found his wife.

32:30.390 --> 32:32.217
- She's in 3.
- Had to do an escharotomy.

32:32.392 --> 32:34.883
She's won't make it.
I broke the news to her husband.

32:35.062 --> 32:39.012
Jordan is working on someone who
has a green fairy tattoo on her wrist.

32:39.316 --> 32:40.347
What?

32:41.735 --> 32:42.933
There was a name tag.

32:43.111 --> 32:46.278
- I found it. It was in her jacket.
- Maybe she borrowed the jacket.

32:46.448 --> 32:47.527
I don't know.

32:51.286 --> 32:52.484
Mr. Leonard?

32:55.582 --> 32:59.331
- Do you have a picture of your wife?
- What? Why?

32:59.503 --> 33:01.910
On your phone or something?

33:02.089 --> 33:03.963
I don't understand.

33:04.174 --> 33:05.918
Why would you want a picture?

33:11.723 --> 33:13.383
I have to show you something.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.510
Oh, my God.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.983
Susan.

33:22.609 --> 33:23.890
I thought you were...

33:24.069 --> 33:27.023
But you're okay. You're okay.

33:28.031 --> 33:29.739
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.367
I love you so much.

33:34.705 --> 33:37.824
- Unbelievable, huh?
- Yeah.

33:38.208 --> 33:41.375
Who's that poor woman who was
burned? And who does she belong to?

33:41.753 --> 33:45.419
Krista, let's see if we can match her
to any of the other reports.

33:47.718 --> 33:51.134
Dr. Clodfelter. You're up early.

33:51.305 --> 33:53.677
Yes. Yes. Yes, I have a minute.

34:07.696 --> 34:08.726
T.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.230
<i>Why didn't you...?</i>

34:11.408 --> 34:12.438
T.

34:12.618 --> 34:13.815
T...

34:20.000 --> 34:21.578
Why?

34:39.228 --> 34:43.177
Finally. I thought I would never...

34:45.108 --> 34:46.686
What is it?

34:47.069 --> 34:48.693
You okay?

34:50.906 --> 34:53.741
I can't... I... I can't breathe.

34:53.909 --> 34:56.862
Nurse. Dr. Clemmens, right now.

34:57.036 --> 34:59.362
- Give me TC. Give me Jordan.
- I'll go page him.

35:00.749 --> 35:01.994
Blood pressure's dropping.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.296
We have to stop the bleeding.
More suction, please.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.424
- What happened?
- Epidural hematoma.

35:17.599 --> 35:20.849
Bullet must've ricocheted and blood
is compressing his spinal cord.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.937
If we don't relieve the bleeding,
he could become paralysed.

35:24.106 --> 35:26.348
- He can't die.
- We need to evacuate this blood.

35:26.775 --> 35:28.684
- Gotcha.
- He can't die.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.772
TC, you okay?

35:32.447 --> 35:33.646
T, save me.

35:33.824 --> 35:37.193
Thad, you gotta stay with me, man.
We gotta stop the bleeding.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.694
- I gotta stop the bleeding.
- Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.

35:39.872 --> 35:40.903
Stop, stop, stop.

35:41.081 --> 35:43.537
- Get him out of here.
- We can't leave him.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.164
- TC. T.
- Stop. Get off me.

35:46.336 --> 35:48.792
- Get him out of here.
- TC, stop.

35:48.964 --> 35:51.372
- TC, it's us. It's us.
- It's all right. Calm down.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.713
- Calm down.
- Get off me.

35:52.885 --> 35:54.379
- It's us.
- Jordan, step in.

35:54.553 --> 35:58.467
- I need you to assist.
- Get him out of here, down the hall.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.048
- Jordan.
- Let's go. Right there.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.602
Guy's a fricking nut job...

36:02.769 --> 36:06.103
and he's gonna drag you
and everyone else here down with him.

36:06.273 --> 36:09.227
Let's just focus on saving Topher
right now. Okay?

36:23.540 --> 36:25.663
I just checked on Topher.
No news yet.

36:25.834 --> 36:28.123
Then they told me
about the whole thing with TC.

36:28.754 --> 36:29.868
Were you there?

36:30.214 --> 36:31.412
- What?
- TC.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.001
Do you know if he's okay?

36:33.175 --> 36:35.666
I... I don't know.

36:36.136 --> 36:37.547
Is everything okay?

36:38.180 --> 36:43.257
I just got a call from Dr. Clodfelter,
the eye surgeon.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.680
So, what did he say?

36:44.853 --> 36:47.261
It's a little more complicated
than we thought.

36:47.648 --> 36:48.846
I...

36:50.526 --> 36:53.017
I have a tumour behind my eye.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.232
Oh, Michael. I'm so sorry.

36:56.657 --> 36:58.733
It's a hell of a night, huh?

37:12.798 --> 37:15.882
We tracked your mother down
in New Orleans, Mary.

37:16.051 --> 37:19.716
She's not gonna be able to get here,
but we're gonna be right here with you.

37:19.888 --> 37:21.217
We will not leave your side.

37:22.140 --> 37:26.470
I have her on the phone, your mother.
She wants to talk to you.

37:27.020 --> 37:28.894
Go ahead, ma'am.

37:29.106 --> 37:32.107
<i>Oh, I love you so much, Mary.</i>

37:32.276 --> 37:37.270
<i>You will always be my baby girl.
Do you hear me?</i>

37:37.447 --> 37:38.479
<i>Always.</i>

37:38.657 --> 37:40.614
She hears you.

37:44.705 --> 37:46.365
So he's gonna be okay?

37:46.540 --> 37:49.327
We got the blood evacuated
and his spinal cord looks good.

37:49.501 --> 37:52.668
If all goes as expected,
he should make a full recovery.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.415
Thank you.

37:54.590 --> 37:55.788
Hey.

37:55.966 --> 37:58.208
Thank you, Jordan.

38:06.393 --> 38:08.433
I have to check on something.

38:16.695 --> 38:21.024
Yeah. Tell the captain I wanna
bring the doc in for questioning.

38:21.200 --> 38:24.450
Let's just say I don't think
she did everything she could.

38:31.460 --> 38:32.919
Take the cuffs off of him now.

38:33.212 --> 38:35.785
- Hey, it was for his own protection.
- Please.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.557
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.387
I'll wait outside.

38:56.485 --> 38:58.774
We don't have to talk.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.147
I'm just gonna sit with you, okay?

39:04.201 --> 39:07.736
- It was my fault.
- No, Topher's gonna be okay.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.158
That was not your fault.

39:09.331 --> 39:12.285
- You did what anyone would do.
- Not what I'm talking about.

39:12.751 --> 39:16.796
- Okay.
- I keep having these memories...

39:17.506 --> 39:19.748
dreams,
whatever you wanna call them.

39:20.259 --> 39:21.539
What about?

39:21.844 --> 39:23.883
About when Thad...

39:24.429 --> 39:25.840
was killed.

39:26.014 --> 39:31.305
I keep seeing him get shot
over and over.

39:32.354 --> 39:35.059
I keep reliving that moment.

39:38.652 --> 39:40.894
That's what I'm talking about.

39:41.321 --> 39:43.693
That's what was my fault.

39:44.366 --> 39:45.694
- No.
- Yeah.

39:45.868 --> 39:49.237
We'll take the front. You take
the back entrance. Watch your six.

39:49.913 --> 39:50.992
Yeah.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.370
I hesitated.

39:56.753 --> 39:59.754
Why didn't you shoot? Why?

40:00.048 --> 40:02.622
The sniper, he was a kid.

40:04.344 --> 40:06.882
He was maybe 12 years old.

40:07.055 --> 40:08.598
Maybe.

40:10.601 --> 40:12.889
<i>He was a kid, Jordan.</i>

40:15.856 --> 40:17.516
Thad.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.023
<i>So I hesitated...</i>

40:27.284 --> 40:29.905
and I got my brother killed.

40:30.370 --> 40:31.615
- No.
- Yeah.

40:31.788 --> 40:33.199
No.

40:33.874 --> 40:36.661
- Hey. Hey.
<i>- For years, I've been blocking it.</i>

40:36.835 --> 40:39.243
- Look at me.
<i>- Blocking that it's my fault.</i>

40:39.421 --> 40:42.505
You've been carrying this around
with you the whole time?

40:44.718 --> 40:47.921
I had to tell somebody, Jordan.
I had to.

40:48.222 --> 40:51.756
- Yeah.
- I thought I could bury it in here...

40:51.934 --> 40:54.057
and I can't.

40:54.937 --> 40:56.846
I can't.

40:58.065 --> 41:00.353
Because... Because I... I...

41:00.526 --> 41:01.984
I got Thad killed.

41:02.444 --> 41:04.816
- Oh, T.
- Thad, I'm so sorry.

41:05.614 --> 41:07.820
I'm so sorry.

41:08.116 --> 41:11.367
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- I'm gonna take care of you.

41:15.582 --> 41:17.658
I'm not going anywhere.
