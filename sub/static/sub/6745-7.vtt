You have the right

You'd hope that they
had been terrorists

or master criminals
and that our people

had died fighting the worst

But they were

and shaking down old people.

Yeah, makes me feel that

on you.

Indeed I do.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.505
Are you talking about
my day as a volunteer?

Because I've hardly ever
felt crappier

have been here to help.

And w-what does it matter what
this Gustavo guy did, anyway?

to take precautions.

immigration status,
