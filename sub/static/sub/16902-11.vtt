WEBVTT

00:03.269 --> 00:04.437
Oh! Good morning, Dr. Baird.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.773
Good morning,
Regular Person Lemon.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.742
Oh, hey, are you
around this weekend?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.477
Um... maybe we could have
that date we talked...

00:10.477 --> 00:11.544
Yes.

00:11.544 --> 00:12.875
Okay.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.949
Uh... how about Friday?

00:15.949 --> 00:18.451
Oh, no. Friday, I have a stupid... show.

00:18.451 --> 00:19.953
How about Saturday?

00:19.953 --> 00:23.556
Saturday, um... okay. I guess
that doesn't have to be weird.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.091
Okay, then.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.127
Okay...

00:27.127 --> 00:28.661
Valentine's Day it is.

00:28.661 --> 00:33.299
Saturday is Valentine's Day? Norts!

00:33.299 --> 00:35.468
You sound so sexy when you say that.

00:35.468 --> 00:36.936
Say it again.

00:36.936 --> 00:40.573
Your mother has
gone back to...

00:40.573 --> 00:44.110
Florida.

00:44.110 --> 00:47.447
These McFlurries are amazing.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.017
I know-- the soft swirl of
vanilla and the hard crunch

00:51.017 --> 00:53.019
of candy and cookies.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.622
You'd think they'd fight each other, but no.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.791
Together, they are perfecto.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.292
Some would say that describes us.

00:59.292 --> 01:00.960
Who would say such a crazy thing?

01:00.960 --> 01:02.429
We are us.

01:02.429 --> 01:06.800
the world's greatest dessert.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.602
Actually, the world's greatest
dessert is served

01:09.602 --> 01:12.806
in a restaurant right here in
New York called Plunder.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.174
It costs $1,000.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.610
Lucky for you, your boyfriend
got reservations

01:17.610 --> 01:19.112
for Valentine's Day.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.681
But I have to go to church.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.383
On Valentine's Day? Is that a thing?

01:23.383 --> 01:26.853
It is the feast of the martyrdom
of St. Valentine.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.221
Please, Jack.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.323
Don't tell me you're one of
those convenient Catholics

01:30.323 --> 01:32.225
that only goes to church every Sunday.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.557
Oh...

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.281 --> 01:56.716
Oh, Kenneth, hey.

01:56.716 --> 01:59.152
You know how the company makes
an effort to hire the disabled?

01:59.152 --> 02:00.954
Do I? I wouldn't have this job

02:00.954 --> 02:02.589
if it weren't for the mouth on my back.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.591
Yeah, I'm supposed to supervise
some blind chick

02:04.591 --> 02:05.892
they hired to edit the reruns.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.594
But three of the dancers just found out

02:07.594 --> 02:10.119
they're all dating the same guy,
so I'm going to go watch that.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.732
So, if you see a blind chick,
I don't know, um...

02:12.732 --> 02:14.033
give her one of your boring tours.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.435
Yes, sir.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.170
Yes, sir.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.967
I'm just
funning, it's all sewed up.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.111
I'll help you, Miss.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.442
Oh, thank you so much.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.849
All my friends warned me about the big city.

02:29.849 --> 02:30.950
But, look.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.542
Right away, I meet a gentleman.

02:36.289 --> 02:39.190
Is everything okay? Because now,
I smell burnt plastic.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.431
Hello?

02:45.431 --> 02:48.234
Are you there?

02:48.234 --> 02:49.936
Hello?

02:49.936 --> 02:52.872
I can't make this guy go on
a first date on Valentine's.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.641
Why are you so nervous about this?

02:54.641 --> 02:56.676
Because it's a delicate situation, Jack.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.811
There is handsomeness involved.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.369
How much?

03:01.781 --> 03:03.983
Oh, come on, Lemon.

03:03.983 --> 03:05.285
What is this, a green card thing?

03:05.285 --> 03:05.818
No.

03:05.818 --> 03:06.286
Closet case?

03:06.286 --> 03:06.886
Don't think so.

03:06.886 --> 03:07.387
Slut buster?

03:07.387 --> 03:08.121
No, not a ball player.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.322
Bundy-esque serial killer?

03:09.322 --> 03:10.880
That was my first thought. But, no.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.989
This is actually happening and I'm blowing it.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.996
Who pushes for a first date on Valentine's Day?

03:16.996 --> 03:19.933
Lemon, here's how you correct this misstep.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.203
Instead of going to a restaurant
where it will be nothing but

03:23.203 --> 03:25.905
people in love and rings hidden in pastries...

03:25.905 --> 03:26.573
Ugh.

03:26.573 --> 03:27.807
Cook him a nice meal at home.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.609
Nice? You mean, like, stew?

03:29.609 --> 03:31.277
I certainly do not mean stew.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.079
I mean, try to forget it's Valentine's Day.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.914
I'm going to. I'll be in church.

03:34.914 --> 03:35.949
What? Why?

03:35.949 --> 03:37.617
Elisa is deeply religious.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.652
If I had those knockers, I'd be thanking God, too.

03:39.652 --> 03:42.055
All I want for Valentine's Day is to go to Plunder

03:42.055 --> 03:43.923
and eat the Lovers' Delight.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.158
That sounds filthy, Jack.

03:45.158 --> 03:49.128
It is. Imagine a dessert for two:

03:49.128 --> 03:51.831
Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream in a pool of cognac

03:51.831 --> 03:54.767
drizzled in the world's most expensive chocolate--

03:54.767 --> 03:56.302
Amedei Porceleana--

03:56.302 --> 03:59.205
covered with shaved white,
black and clear truffles

03:59.205 --> 04:03.142
and topped with edible 25-karat gold leaf.

04:03.142 --> 04:05.144
Can you imagine anything better?

04:05.144 --> 04:07.704
I don't know. Have you ever put
a donut in the microwave?

04:09.549 --> 04:12.151
Come on, church won't be so bad.
Aren't you Catholic?

04:12.151 --> 04:13.720
I was Catholic.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.190
But I haven't set foot inside a
church since I was 13 years old.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.858
So, listen, so you go sit
through a night of church

04:18.858 --> 04:21.560
and then you go to Plunder.
Elisa's worth it.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.129
You're right. Elisa is worth it.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.960
And I can fake enthusiasm when I need to.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.333
Hey, that scarf is fun!

04:27.333 --> 04:30.598
Thanks. I found it at Dunkin... wait a minute.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.773
NBC? Blah, blah, blah. Thank you.

04:40.713 --> 04:44.617
Ken, you need to snap out of it
and ask out that sexy Ms. Magoo.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.719
I have no idea what you're talking about.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.755
I know love at first sight when I see it.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.124
I saw it when I met Angie.

04:51.124 --> 04:55.261
I saw it the first time Dotcom
laid eyes on Grizz's fiancee.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.597
Okay, there is something
about Jennifer that just

04:57.597 --> 05:00.088
makes me all carsick inside.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.536
Now is the time for gallantry.

05:15.181 --> 05:17.950
Oh! It's you again.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.611
I can tell.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.957
Well, cotton and fiddles.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.726
I enjoy your smile.

05:26.726 --> 05:27.658
Oh, my.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.896
I'm Jennifer Rogers.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.231
You may call me
Kenneth the page

05:32.231 --> 05:35.068
because that is
who I am.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.036
Would you like to go out
with me tomorrow night?

05:37.036 --> 05:39.072
Yes, indeedy corncobs?

05:39.072 --> 05:40.707
Well, I'm going to say yes

05:40.707 --> 05:41.774
because this just

05:41.774 --> 05:45.445
feels right and my instincts
have never let me down...

05:45.445 --> 05:47.380
except for looking at that eclipse.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.882
It's a Valentine's date-li-doo!

05:56.789 --> 05:59.058
That was really good stew.

05:59.058 --> 05:59.892
Thank you.

05:59.892 --> 06:02.662
It's my own recipe where I use
cheddar cheese instead of water.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.797
You know, I'm glad we stayed in tonight.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.332
It's good to take things slow.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.368
Well, please know that when
I invited you over

06:08.368 --> 06:10.269
I didn't realize it was Valentine's Day.

06:10.269 --> 06:12.705
Yeah, you still have that
rotting jack-o-lantern in the hallway,

06:12.705 --> 06:15.007
so I feel like you don't have
a great sense of what month it is.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.210
Well, it's just gotten
so small that I kind of

06:17.210 --> 06:18.370
want to see if it disappears.

06:20.246 --> 06:23.116
So, uh, first date stuff...
where are you from?

06:23.116 --> 06:25.685
Well, there's a really interesting
answer to that question.

06:25.685 --> 06:28.087
Actually, I was born

06:28.087 --> 06:30.456
on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.425
Okay, I feel like I should do the right thing here

06:32.425 --> 06:34.694
and tell you that your breast
has fallen out of your blouse

06:34.694 --> 06:36.796
and I can see all of it.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.732
Okay. Well, I guess we just...

06:39.732 --> 06:42.001
jumped ahead to date four.

06:42.001 --> 06:43.636
It's not the good one, either.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.082
Jack Donaghy's office.

06:56.082 --> 07:00.219
Jonathan... our Jonathan,
who art in the office

07:00.219 --> 07:02.655
hallowed be my reservation.

07:02.655 --> 07:03.823
If you are able...

07:03.823 --> 07:05.024
hold my table

07:05.024 --> 07:06.859
at Plunder

07:06.859 --> 07:08.561
as we will not be there by seven.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.164
Have them delay our heavenly dessert

07:11.164 --> 07:14.967
and forgive us our lateness,
as we forgive those

07:14.967 --> 07:17.370
who cause lateness against us.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.376
Well, thank you for explaining that.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.645
I always wanted to know how
a universal remote works.

07:25.645 --> 07:28.981
Well, that's how it does.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.586
Would you excuse me just one second?

07:33.586 --> 07:35.221
I'll be right back.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.330
Oh, cheese stew. What was I thinking?

07:46.933 --> 07:48.601
I think your brownies are burning.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.236
You want me to take them out?

07:50.236 --> 07:52.238
Oh, yes, please,
um, but whatever you do

07:52.238 --> 07:54.240
don't open that kitchen window.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.375
No!

07:56.375 --> 07:57.569
Oh! Too soon!

08:01.914 --> 08:03.249
The draft made the door fly open!

08:03.249 --> 08:04.417
I know. It's not a big deal.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.887
So, we skipped from date four to date... 20.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.556
No, date never! I would never let that happen.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.192
Liz, it's okay. I'm a doctor.
I've seen much worse.

08:13.192 --> 08:13.826
Really?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.328
I'm just kidding. That was pretty bad.

08:16.696 --> 08:17.964
Hold on, hold on.

08:17.964 --> 08:20.266
I'm sorry. I have to get this.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.334
Hello? Mandy...

08:21.334 --> 08:23.936
Yeah-- no, I'm downstairs in 3B. Why?

08:23.936 --> 08:26.873
No, Mandy. You can't just drop
her off without calling.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.542
Mandy? Is that, like, a guy
friend, like Mandy Patinkin?

08:29.542 --> 08:30.643
No, I can't...

08:30.643 --> 08:32.278
because I am on a date right now.

08:32.278 --> 08:33.346
No, Mandy...

08:33.346 --> 08:35.047
don't hang up.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.448
Sorry.

08:36.448 --> 08:37.783
That was my ex-wife.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.751
My daughter, Bethany, is on her way up.

08:39.751 --> 08:40.785
You have a daughter.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.587
You will see her. You will say she's cute.

08:42.587 --> 08:45.819
But let me just say that she is... complicated.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.995
My mother usually watches her when I can't

08:48.995 --> 08:51.197
but my mother has been in
the hospital recently

08:51.197 --> 08:53.566
and she's not doing very well
and that has been...

08:53.566 --> 08:54.692
hard for me to handle.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.870
I'm sorry that all this keeps falling apart.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.140
I was really looking forward to tonight.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.575
Well, we could try again some other time.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.976
Or...

09:03.976 --> 09:05.077
I'm listening.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.547
Maybe tonight is a gift.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.217
Maybe we embrace the... toilet
thing and the bra incident

09:11.217 --> 09:13.219
and my ex-wife and my daughter

09:13.219 --> 09:14.754
and we just get it all out in one night.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.556
And if, by the end of it,
we still like each other

09:16.556 --> 09:18.090
then maybe it's the real thing.

09:19.525 --> 09:22.128
All right, that would be Bethany.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.664
Um... this is it.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.399
The express train is leaving the station.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.567
I'm on the train.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.660
Okay.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.307
Mom's keying your car.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.308
Bethany, this is Liz.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.676
Hi. It's so...

09:36.676 --> 09:38.277
Why does it smell in here?

09:38.277 --> 09:40.245
- I got sick.
- Beef stew.

09:40.346 --> 09:43.849
Okay, be nice. I will be right
back after I go talk to your mother.

09:43.849 --> 09:44.984
And give me your purse.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.352
Why don't you ever trust me?

09:46.352 --> 09:48.582
Because, honey, you keep
setting fire to things.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.427
And now, a prayer

09:54.427 --> 09:56.596
for the pregnant members
of our congregation:

09:56.596 --> 10:03.970
Anita Alvarez, Anna Alvarez,
Annabelle Alvarez...

10:03.970 --> 10:05.771
Honey, this is a Catholic church.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.306
We'll be here until morning.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.442
All right, you've been good.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.210
Let's go.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.946
We just have to go to confession
before we leave.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.982
Priest:... Benita Alvaros.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.319
Okay, here's how
this is going to go.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.655
We're going to sit here in
silence for about three minutes.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.958
Then, I'm going to take
my girlfriend to Plunder

10:25.958 --> 10:28.961
where the Pope himself could not get a table.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.796
You sound troubled, my son.

10:30.796 --> 10:31.731
Can it, Father.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.132
That was a nice try, though.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.900
That limo ride was weird.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.503
I felt like we just circled
the block 50 times.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.105
That's how you get

10:39.105 --> 10:41.540
to Manhattan's fanciest restaurant.

10:41.540 --> 10:45.378
Ah, Monsieur Parcell.
Votre table est prit.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.947
I didn't know it was
a French restaurant.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.483
Yes, I found it on
my favorite website

10:50.483 --> 10:52.918
StopShowingOff.com.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.416
It's busy tonight.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.026
This is the best
darn-tootingest restaurant

11:00.026 --> 11:01.827
in all of New York.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.797
This is the best night ever.
Thank you, Kenneth.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.594
You're one in a million.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.336
Man, can you believe we're
working on Valentine's night?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.338
My fiancee is gonna be upset.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.274
Not to worry, I sent her flowers
and a beautiful card.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.139
You're the best.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.112
Don't you have faith?

11:20.112 --> 11:22.615
I have faith... in things I can see

11:22.615 --> 11:26.419
and buy and deregulate.
Capitalism is my religion.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.287
You want to have an intellectual
argument? Fine.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.722
But I should warn you I went to Princeton.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.424
I went to Harvard Divinity School.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.794
You Crimson guys never
miss a chance, do you?

11:34.794 --> 11:35.995
You want a confession?

11:35.995 --> 11:37.596
Let's get this done so I can go eat.

11:37.596 --> 11:38.964
I am divorced.

11:38.964 --> 11:42.134
I take the Lord's name in vain
often and with great relish.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.370
I hit my mother with a car...

11:44.370 --> 11:47.039
possibly by accident.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.775
I almost let him choke to death
right there on the football field.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.110
I looked the other way

11:51.110 --> 11:54.780
when my wig-based parent company
turned a bunch of children orange.

11:54.780 --> 11:58.238
I once claimed I am God
during a deposition.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.622
And... I may have sodomized
our former Vice President

12:03.622 --> 12:04.990
while under the influence of

12:04.990 --> 12:06.892
some weapons-grade narcotics.

12:06.892 --> 12:11.063
It feels good to say
that out loud, actually.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.398
That one was weighing on me.

12:12.398 --> 12:16.402
Wow, I... I...
I don't know what to say.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.870
I don't want you to say anything.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.004
I already made that clear.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.607
Then what brought you here tonight?

12:21.607 --> 12:24.610
What brought me here?
What brings anyone anywhere?

12:24.610 --> 12:26.712
Why do men build bridges?
Why are there jets?

12:26.712 --> 12:28.681
I was hoping to have sex tonight.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.617
Have you ever made love
to a woman, Father?

12:31.617 --> 12:33.018
Come on, man.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.287
Imagine cradling your face into

12:35.287 --> 12:38.357
the curve of a velvety-soft neck

12:38.357 --> 12:42.628
your hands cupping the warm heft
of the greatest pair of...

12:42.628 --> 12:46.899
I need backup! Harvard did not
prepare me for this.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.300
Father?

12:55.875 --> 12:57.476
I like your bracelets.

12:57.476 --> 13:00.379
Girls in my school get them for
doing different things on the bus.

13:00.379 --> 13:01.539
Blue is for showing your boobs.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.450
Purple is for doing stuff over your clothes.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.785
Black is for doing stuff...

13:05.785 --> 13:07.586
Okay, uh... your mom left.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.688
How are you two getting along?

13:09.688 --> 13:11.656
She had some more stew
while you were outside.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.364
Whoa. Wow, Liz, did you
kill the whole bottle?

13:18.364 --> 13:20.299
What?

13:22.401 --> 13:24.870
Uh... sorry. Hello?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.205
Yes, Gloria.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.673
Why are you crying?

13:27.673 --> 13:29.575
Gloria? How many ex-wives does he have?

13:29.575 --> 13:30.609
That's my aunt.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.378
She is not going to like you.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.412
No, of course.

13:33.412 --> 13:34.580
I'll be there as soon as I can.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.315
Yeah, good-bye.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.417
Mom has taken a turn.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.919
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.153
Look, I know I said that we would take this

13:41.153 --> 13:42.922
in fast motion tonight, but...

13:42.922 --> 13:43.923
No. No, I know.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.624
I really am glad we did

13:45.624 --> 13:46.992
because I don't think I can
handle this by myself.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.756
Oh. Okay.

13:51.630 --> 13:52.698
What?

13:52.698 --> 13:53.824
Liz knew.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.603
Entertainment?

13:57.603 --> 13:59.738
Not just any entertainment

13:59.738 --> 14:01.501
the best singer in the world...

14:02.074 --> 14:03.676
Michael McDonald.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.792
Wow, he does not sound good live.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.352
# Once in a life...?

14:32.438 --> 14:33.806
Oh, okay, in English, in English.

14:33.806 --> 14:37.276
You tortured that poor priest.
Let me ask you something.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.411
Do you even believe in the teachings of

14:39.411 --> 14:40.446
the Catholic Church?

14:40.446 --> 14:41.981
No.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.416
But I saw your photo
with the Pope.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.818
That's just good business.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.286
I have photos with a lot of people--

14:47.286 --> 14:48.988
The Dalai Lama, Rabbi Yossef,
Toby Keith...

14:48.988 --> 14:52.658
I see. You have no faith, only business.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.260
You know what
your problem is, Jack?

14:54.260 --> 14:56.996
You intellectualize everything
with your big head.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.130
Well, you have big boobs.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.798
Which you will never touch again!

14:59.798 --> 15:02.401
This conversation has taken
an unfortunate turn.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.271
Maybe this is God trying to tell
me that we do not belong together.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.006
Maybe this is a sign.

15:07.006 --> 15:10.009
Look, my driver just pulled up.
That's a sign.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.911
God wants us to leave here,
get a good meal

15:11.911 --> 15:13.674
and go to town on each other.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.851
How dare you say something like that
so close to the statue of Santa Lucia...

15:18.851 --> 15:21.453
the patron saint of judgmental statues.

15:21.453 --> 15:24.356
Go to your stupid restaurant.

15:24.356 --> 15:25.724
Eat your gold ice cream.

15:25.724 --> 15:26.625
Please come with me.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.694
No. You blew it, Jack.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.095
And now, you will never see

15:30.095 --> 15:32.222
the crazy underwears I have on.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.136
Elisa!

15:37.136 --> 15:40.765
What kind of God would let that happen?

15:46.278 --> 15:49.114
Oh, Drew, finally. Who is this?

15:49.114 --> 15:49.915
This is Liz.

15:49.915 --> 15:50.916
This is our first date.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.117
On Valentine's Day?

15:52.117 --> 15:54.887
he saw me on the toilet...

15:54.887 --> 15:56.288
Liz.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.416
Oh, Dr. Baird, your mother's
asked to speak to you privately.

16:15.574 --> 16:18.210
I'm sorry... is this, like,
a "Sixth Sense" thing?

16:18.210 --> 16:19.871
Should I bring a place
setting for your friend?

16:34.960 --> 16:35.961
Mom?

16:35.961 --> 16:37.096
Who is that?

16:37.096 --> 16:38.097
That's my friend, Liz.

16:38.097 --> 16:40.099
Hi, Mrs. Baird.

16:40.099 --> 16:42.634
It's too soon, Andrew.

16:42.634 --> 16:45.104
I know, we tried to take it slow.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.840
Life... I have more I want to do.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.842
Oh, right, you. Of course.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.211
I'm going to go grab her chart.
I'll be right back.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.576
Um...

16:54.013 --> 16:56.215
Mandy?

16:56.215 --> 16:58.584
You look terrible.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.719
Oh, no, I'm not Mandy.
I'm Liz.

17:00.719 --> 17:04.690
Mandy, you have to tell
Drew something for me.

17:04.690 --> 17:10.061
The woman he thinks is his
sister is really his mother.

17:10.061 --> 17:10.896
What?

17:10.896 --> 17:12.761
I'm his grandmother.

17:14.566 --> 17:18.569
You have to tell him or
I won't get into Heaven.

17:23.208 --> 17:27.346
Thank you for a truly unbelievable evening.

17:27.346 --> 17:30.182
It doesn't have to
end here, y'allsies.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.253
Wait, this isn't right.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.989
Kenneth, why do you
suddenly sound white?

17:36.989 --> 17:39.024
I lied to you, Jennifer.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.225
I was too scared to talk to you

17:40.225 --> 17:42.394
so my sophisticated
friend, Tracy

17:42.394 --> 17:46.031
said the things that I couldn't.
I'm very, very sorry.

17:46.031 --> 17:49.101
Well, if you could have talked
to me, what would you have said?

17:49.101 --> 17:51.770
That you're the sweetest...

17:51.770 --> 17:53.906
prettiest, blindest girl
I've ever met.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.176
And when I'm with you, my heart
jumps like a frog

17:57.176 --> 17:59.912
on July asphalt right before it dies.

17:59.912 --> 18:05.350
You're so beautiful on
the inside, Kenneth Parcell.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.219
Can I feel your face?

18:07.219 --> 18:08.345
Yeah.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.522
Oh...

18:27.372 --> 18:32.377
Oh, look at the time.
I forgot I have a... a thing.

18:32.377 --> 18:35.047
That is cold, blind lady!

18:35.047 --> 18:36.281
Oh, and by the way...

18:36.281 --> 18:38.417
you are not so attractive, yourself.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.619
No, I'm... I'm pretty sure I'm hot.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.383
Yes, you are. I tried.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.080
I'm so sorry.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.877
Listen, thank you so much for
being so great during all this.

19:11.183 --> 19:12.651
Let's do this again sometime...

19:12.651 --> 19:14.319
except have it not be anything
like this at all.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.289
Good night.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.688
Good night.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.330
Uh... Liz?

19:25.330 --> 19:27.199
You know, my mom did just die.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.301
Funny story.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.370
Hear me out.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.939
I'll have a, uh...

19:33.939 --> 19:35.873
...a McFlurry, please.

19:37.109 --> 19:40.879
And I have a coupon.
You know where I found it?

19:40.879 --> 19:43.982
In the collection plate. It was a sign.

19:43.982 --> 19:45.350
I followed it

19:45.350 --> 19:47.953
and it brought us back together.
Now do you believe?

19:47.953 --> 19:48.885
I believe.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.824
I believe that we were reunited
by the most successful

19:52.824 --> 19:55.227
capitalist enterprise
of the last hundred years

19:55.227 --> 19:58.197
despite the McLean Deluxe
or the McEmu.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.464
Whatever.

19:59.464 --> 20:02.134
Someone's trying to tell us
that we belong together.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.235
Maybe it's God.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.536
Maybe it's Ray Kroc.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.094
Maybe it's the Hamburgler.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.842
Happy Valentine's Day, querida.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.436
Happy St. Valentine's Day, mi amor.

20:27.326 --> 20:31.163
Boy, I hope that guy's not
planning to kill and eat her.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.530
Jack, you're such
a romantic.
