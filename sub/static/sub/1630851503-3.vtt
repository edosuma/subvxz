WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.307
Ohh!

00:06.340 --> 00:08.976
Look at you doing
your homework before
you go out to play.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.844
If you get an "A," I'm gonna
put it up on the fridge

00:10.878 --> 00:13.047
right next to your
clean colonoscopy results.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.916
This family's accomplished
so little,

00:15.949 --> 00:18.186
anything without polyps
is a win.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.989
I'm working my sobriety steps.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.324
I'm on step four --

00:23.357 --> 00:26.527
making a fearless
moral inventory of myself.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.363
Oh, yeah? I took
my own inventory recently.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.299
I found I was running low
on patience.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.701
That was just
my clever way of saying,

00:33.734 --> 00:36.670
"Get your asses over here
and help with the dishes."

00:36.704 --> 00:38.439
Now I have to add <i>that</i>
to my list.

00:38.472 --> 00:42.910
"Haven't told my father
he's not really that clever."

00:44.278 --> 00:46.280
I'm so proud of you
for being sober,

00:46.314 --> 00:48.749
but you were a lot sweeter
when you were drunk.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.719
Sometimes I miss
my tipsy little angel.

00:51.752 --> 00:55.123
Hey, you still have
your barren little devil.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.558
Um, can I borrow that?

01:00.828 --> 01:03.131
Add "Being mean to your sister"
to your list.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.765
Oh, you don't have
a pen!

01:06.767 --> 01:09.303
Oh, when you were little,
it was so cute when you fought.

01:09.337 --> 01:13.307
Now it's just two bitter old
spinsters going at it.

01:15.143 --> 01:18.779
My next step
is making amends.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.114
Mikey's coming to town,

01:20.148 --> 01:22.883
so I'm taking him out to lunch
to apologize

01:22.916 --> 01:25.619
for lying about
being a giant success.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.722
Why? <i>Someone</i> out there
should think you're a winner.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.226
Because we're friends, and I
want to be honest with him.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.662
I know that "honesty"
and "friends"

01:34.695 --> 01:36.930
are not concepts that
you're familiar with,

01:36.964 --> 01:38.966
so just continue
to stare at me blankly

01:38.999 --> 01:41.135
and think about yourself.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.771
No, that's not
what I was doing.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.174
I was thinking about telling
Pastor Phil

01:46.207 --> 01:47.908
why I ran out of church
the other day

01:47.941 --> 01:49.577
and how I'm still gonna need
some path

01:49.610 --> 01:53.013
around the smoking hole
that Ben left in my heart.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.349
Huh, look at that.
I <i>was</i> thinking about me.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.920
So, when I looked
in the Bible

01:59.953 --> 02:03.291
and I saw my mom begging God
to stop her pain,

02:03.324 --> 02:06.660
I just -- I freaked out,
you know?

02:06.694 --> 02:10.264
Well, I believe that God's heart
was the first to break,

02:10.298 --> 02:14.535
but, ultimately, we're in charge
of our own destiny.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.470
I am sorry
about your mom.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.138
Thank you.
Yeah, I just --

02:18.172 --> 02:20.140
I didn't want you to think
I ran out because of you.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.476
No.
I never had a runner before.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.144
I made it work for me.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.514
When you left, I told the
congregation when you came in,

02:26.547 --> 02:30.050
you weren't able to walk,
so hallelujah!

02:30.083 --> 02:32.786
The real miracle is that you got
me into church at all.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.954
I hope they got you, like,

02:33.987 --> 02:35.989
a Red Robin gift card
or something for that.

02:37.425 --> 02:40.194
You know, I-I am still
looking for a place

02:40.228 --> 02:42.330
to find
spiritual guidance.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.132
Well, there's a lot of ways
to do that.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.900
It, uh...

02:46.934 --> 02:48.536
doesn't have to be
the church.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.638
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for understanding.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.974
Kind of thought you'd fight
a little harder for me, but...

02:54.007 --> 02:55.709
It's gonna take some time,
Darlene,

02:55.743 --> 02:58.546
to find the path
that works for you.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.813
I know your mom's gone,

02:59.847 --> 03:01.249
but is there anyone else
in the house

03:01.282 --> 03:03.651
that you can talk to about
what you're going through?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.086
Well, there's my Aunt Jackie,
but that's kind of like saying,

03:06.119 --> 03:07.588
"Well, there's Daffy Duck."

03:07.621 --> 03:09.590
Anybody else?

03:09.623 --> 03:12.426
There's Louise,
my dad's fiancée.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.763
I mean, she's really grounded,
and she's been through a lot.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.599
But I don't know.
I'd love to talk to her.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.100
I'm not really close enough
to her

03:20.133 --> 03:22.436
to dump all my toxic baggage
in her lap.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.171
She's marrying your dad.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.774
Now is the time
to build that relationship.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.910
And then later, when you're
closer and she trusts you --

03:29.943 --> 03:32.346
boop, boop, boop.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.582
Toxic baggage.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.587
- - <i>Captions by VITAC</i> --

04:21.629 --> 04:24.231
Hey, Mikey.
Thanks for coming.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.634
You ready to go to lunch?
I can't.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.635
Why not?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.570
I wanted to tell you
some things I did

04:29.603 --> 04:31.605
that weren't so great.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.407
But they're
too embarrassing.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.344
And I don't want to see the pity
in your eyes, so here.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.747
I wrote it all down
in case I chickened out.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.615
Becky, we're friends.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.216
You can tell me anything.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.687
Turn around.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.326
Okay.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.663
I totally lied
about going to college

04:55.696 --> 04:58.298
and being
a huge success.

04:59.567 --> 05:04.672
The truth is,
I'm a recovering alcoholic

05:04.705 --> 05:07.975
who wasted a lot of years

05:08.008 --> 05:11.512
making really bad choices.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.847
I am so sorry.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.618
Uh...

05:17.651 --> 05:21.021
I know that was hard.
Thanks for telling me.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.957
That's it?
You're not mad at me?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.158
No.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.294
No, I had a feeling some of
what you said wasn't true

05:27.327 --> 05:29.497
once I figured out Vasterflagen
wasn't a college,

05:29.530 --> 05:30.831
it was an Ikea cabinet.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.966
I-I panicked.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.635
I almost
said "Chumbawamba."

05:36.103 --> 05:38.639
Look, why don't we have lunch
and catch up for real?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.674
I want to hear about
your <i>actual</i> life.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.310
You sure you want to hear
the gory details?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.845
Hey, you're not
the only one

05:44.878 --> 05:46.547
that's done something
embarrassing when they're drunk.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.982
Try challenging a four-year-old
to a dance battle

05:49.016 --> 05:50.718
at a family picnic
and losing.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.486
I can top that.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.457
I repeatedly tried to
order a piña colada
from a bank teller.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.262
Okay, guys, I need help.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.098
Mark and I are trying to make
place cards for the reception.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.669
Does anyone know where the other
half of the big scissors is?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.104
Where'd you find
half a scissors?

06:11.138 --> 06:12.172
Sticking in
the dart board.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.508
I got a bull's-eye.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.743
Oh, you know what?

06:15.776 --> 06:19.279
I do have more scissors
in the sewing drawer.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.881
Nobody around here sews,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.883
so they were probably used
on toenails or something,

06:22.916 --> 06:24.452
but they should do the job.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.622
Listen, when you're done
with place cards,

06:28.656 --> 06:30.357
how about grabbing
a cup of coffee someplace?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.625
You and I never do that.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.962
Well, I'd love to, but I got
a long list of things to do,

06:34.995 --> 06:38.732
and Mark charges me a dollar
every time I get behind.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.134
Okay. Oh, you know what?
How about this?

06:41.168 --> 06:44.071
I will jump in and help you, and
we can catch up along the way.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.106
You shouldn't be doing all this
on your own anyway.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.542
Well, that would
be fantastic.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.544
So, what can I take
off your plate?

06:50.578 --> 06:53.714
Well, you can save my life right
now if you can help me find

06:53.747 --> 06:55.816
a reasonable place
to rent silverware.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.485
"Silverware"?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.720
Is the queen coming?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.956
No, here's what
Dan and Roseanne did.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.993
You get those plastic utensils
that look like silver

07:06.026 --> 07:07.961
at the Dollar Store,
but you just got to remember

07:07.995 --> 07:10.063
you can't really use
the knife and fork

07:10.097 --> 07:13.567
to cut anything actually,
like Salisbury steak or pot pie,

07:13.601 --> 07:14.902
because they just snap off,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.638
and then you're just poking
at your food with a handle.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.640
I appreciate that.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.975
But, you know, we're gonna do
things a little bit differently

07:22.009 --> 07:23.276
than Dan and Roseanne.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.645
Okay!

07:26.113 --> 07:28.415
Silverware rental.
Got it. Easy.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.584
Oh, thank you so much.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.853
You know, for food,
I am deciding between

07:32.886 --> 07:35.455
two different caterers --
Italian or Polish.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.626
You know what? You can eliminate
your silverware problem

07:38.659 --> 07:40.093
by serving Moroccan.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.796
You eat with your hands,
they do great vegetarian.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.432
You know what? I actually think
we've got a menu here someplace.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.768
Um,
that's really interesting,

07:47.801 --> 07:50.938
but my family's
not really into spicy food.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.941
They're more into
meat inside other meat.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.375
Oh. Okay.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.944
Um, yeah, see, this is why

07:56.977 --> 07:58.111
we have to spend
more time together.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.780
I never knew that about you.
But that's alright.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.882
We'll just circle back
on the dinner thing.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.284
Oh, but you know what
we do have to get you

08:04.317 --> 08:06.353
is a great wedding dress.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.522
You know what? I said
if I ever got married again,

08:08.556 --> 08:09.723
I would wear black.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.159
You are so rock and roll.
You just have to do that.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.563
Yeah. Well, you know, um,
here's the thing --

08:15.596 --> 08:17.130
I already got the dress.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.333
And I decided to go a little
more "Here Comes the Bride"

08:20.367 --> 08:22.736
and a little less
"Don't Fear the Reaper."

08:22.770 --> 08:24.304
Okay, yeah.
Well, you know what?

08:24.337 --> 08:27.140
There's a lot of other things on
this list I can help you with.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.810
Um...
Oh, you know what?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.680
Instead of Moroccan,
let's do Ethiopian.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.015
I love that
we're doing this together.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.553
I can't believe you
picked out the wedding
dress without me.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.354
I'm less hurt
than I am concerned.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.924
I didn't.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.660
I want you and Harris
to pick it out with me.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.730
Everyone's energy
is just so intense.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.499
I'm -- I'm too stressed
to deal with that right now.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.901
<i>You're</i> stressed?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.236
I'm planning a wedding
without a clipboard.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.242
So?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.611
One spin, please.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.779
Okay.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.180
Keep spinning...

09:07.214 --> 09:09.883
until the dress flies off you
and back onto the rack.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.720
Why?
What's wrong with it?

09:12.753 --> 09:15.488
It's your wedding day,
not Friday night at "da club."

09:16.489 --> 09:17.691
Go classic.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.627
Look, I don't even know
why we're doing this.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.262
Weddings are just a scam to make
women spend money

09:22.295 --> 09:24.698
on an institution
created to oppress them.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.266
You know, you left out
the best part --

09:26.299 --> 09:29.770
All the bridesmaids
get to wear the same dress.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.773
How do you feel about
being oppressed in green?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.474
So, we're supposed to
look disgusting

09:34.507 --> 09:35.743
to make you
look beautiful?

09:35.776 --> 09:36.677
Welcome aboard.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.781
But I was too drunk
to realize

09:40.814 --> 09:44.251
the coin-operated horsey wasn't
going to outrun the mall cops.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.287
I'm -- I'm sorry.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.256
I feel bad for laughing
at your stories.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.663
I mean, I'm proud I got sober,
but I'm not out of the woods.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.900
My dad's wedding's coming up,
so that's gonna be tough.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.003
If it'd help, I could go with
you and be your support system.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.938
Really?
Yeah.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.239
Thanks!

10:06.273 --> 10:09.142
I can't even imagine
dealing with a real date yet.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.011
And what if I really like
the guy?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.181
Sober sex terrifies me.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.283
You'll figure it out.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.751
I don't know.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.286
You have to
look into their eyes.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.854
You got to say nice things.

10:20.888 --> 10:24.457
You got to...figure out
when everybody's done.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.193
That <i>is</i> hard.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.962
That's why I try to be polite
and yell out, "I'm done,"

10:28.996 --> 10:30.798
so there's no confusion.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.000
It's gonna be scary.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.635
I was never self-conscious
because I was drunk.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.004
I get it.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.706
Look, if you're with a guy

10:38.739 --> 10:40.173
and you start to feel
self-conscious,

10:40.207 --> 10:43.443
just remember that you're smart,
you're beautiful,

10:43.476 --> 10:46.780
and he's only thinking about
how lucky he is.

10:46.814 --> 10:50.050
That's so sweet.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.385
Do you want to have sex
with me?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.621
I'm sorry, what?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.390
If I was drunk, that would have
come out so much better.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.059
No, no.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.695
You said it fine...

11:01.729 --> 11:04.164
and...I'm flattered.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.633
But why me?

11:06.666 --> 11:10.470
Because I trust you, and I want
to get it out of the way.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.539
You must have been a much better
flirt as a drunk,

11:12.572 --> 11:14.307
because that was
really subpar.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.911
No! I mean you're my friend,
and you don't judge me.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.115
Come on.
Don't leave me hanging.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.385
Okay.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.920
But I wish
you'd mentioned something

11:26.954 --> 11:29.022
before I ate a whole
meatloaf sandwich and pie.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.858
Don't worry.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.227
I'm packing lasagna and a full
order of mozzarella sticks.

11:34.261 --> 11:38.098
This whole thing is gonna be
embarrassing and awful.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.933
Let's make some magic.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.307
Here we are.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.944
Wow. This is
a really nice hotel room.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.546
That's a nice lamp
and nice drapes

11:53.580 --> 11:55.783
and a nice...

11:55.816 --> 11:58.786
little stumpy stool thing.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.588
Look, it's totally cool if
you're having second thoughts.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.757
Oh, no way.
No way.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.658
We are getting
this done.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.896
Where should we start?

12:08.929 --> 12:11.965
Uh, well, the last time I did
it, it started with a kiss.

12:17.805 --> 12:18.972
That was pretty good,
right?

12:19.006 --> 12:20.107
Okay.
Okay.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.609
I think I'm ready
to move this to the bed.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.712
Oh, too fast?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.247
It's all good.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.887
At some point,
we're gonna need to be naked.

12:33.921 --> 12:34.955
I agree.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.660
Why don't we do some more
of the kissing stuff,

12:40.693 --> 12:42.595
and then just
let it happen?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.866
Right. Okay.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.841
Were your eyes open
the whole time?

12:53.874 --> 12:57.010
I forgot
what to do with them!

12:57.044 --> 13:00.580
I'm so freaking nervous,
I can't even tell you.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.916
Hey...

13:02.950 --> 13:07.754
Remember, you're smart,
you're beautiful,

13:07.787 --> 13:11.124
and the guy is thinking about
how lucky he is.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.626
How about
we turn off the lights,

13:13.660 --> 13:16.964
and maybe we'll feel
more comfortable.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.631
Yeah, that'd be good.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.605
Okay, I'm naked.
Let's go.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.608
Sorry, still stuck trying to get
this knot out of my shoe.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.609
Aw, forget it.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.711
I just need
the important stuff naked.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.515
We're trying to figure out
what Bears fans are gonna like,

13:35.548 --> 13:37.384
so you got to drink like
a Bears fan.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.986
You're sipping!

13:39.019 --> 13:40.287
I'm busy.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.123
I found this great place
that makes plastic flowers

13:43.156 --> 13:44.324
from recycled tires.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.960
This wedding is gonna have
no carbon footprint.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.395
Mm...

13:48.428 --> 13:50.563
Every bride
dreams of that.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.400
I got to hand it to you.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.136
You got kicked to the curb
after proposing to Ben,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.538
and here you are jumping in
to help out Louise.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.140
I mean, it's healthy,
right?

14:00.173 --> 14:03.643
Uh-huh. Well, <i>I</i> think so,
but I'm plowed.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.479
What's that?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.847
Instagram.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.418
This is weird.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.853
Harris is with Louise
at a bridal shop,

14:13.887 --> 14:15.588
and Louise
is trying on dresses.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.257
Son of a bitch,
they're dress-shopping

14:17.290 --> 14:18.691
for the wedding
without us?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.193
Well, I don't get it.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.995
She told us
she already had the dress.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.931
Well,
she's obviously lying.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.165
Well, why would she
do that?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.166
I'll tell you why.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.334
It's just like a man

14:27.367 --> 14:30.437
to try and silence strong women
with opinions.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.872
She's a woman, Jackie.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.808
It's all the steroids
in the meat.

14:37.744 --> 14:38.946
We should go down there

14:38.979 --> 14:41.281
'cause she shouldn't think
she can get away with this.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.850
Yeah,
I-I guess we have to.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.553
Man, I-I was
only suggesting things

14:46.586 --> 14:47.754
to make
the wedding better.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.289
I can't believe
she's excluding me

14:49.322 --> 14:51.391
like I was
trying to ruin it.
Yeah.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.026
I mean,
if she didn't want you there

14:53.060 --> 14:55.628
because you dress like a house
painter or, you know, you --

14:55.662 --> 14:58.298
she felt like you were gonna
bring everybody down --

14:58.331 --> 15:00.934
your face does pull the sun
right out of the sky --

15:00.968 --> 15:04.437
then she should tell you that
instead of lying!

15:04.471 --> 15:07.941
This is why
I never come to you, Daffy.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.084
You okay?

15:17.117 --> 15:19.386
Okay?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.554
I was fabulous!

15:21.588 --> 15:23.923
I totally crushed
sober sex!

15:25.825 --> 15:27.227
I know my favorite moves,

15:27.260 --> 15:28.795
but you tell me
what you liked best.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.130
I liked them all.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.298
Yeah, but rank 'em.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.666
This is just like high school.
You want a grade.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.968
Everything was "A"-plus.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.669
You're getting a free ride
to Vasterflagen.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.006
Ha ha!

15:39.039 --> 15:42.175
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.345
I have a confession.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.450
I dreamed about this happening
when we were in high school.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.085
I had a huge crush on you.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.420
Really?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.088
Yeah.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.625
And I...kind of still do.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.627
What?!

16:00.660 --> 16:01.961
The last time I saw you

16:01.995 --> 16:05.465
I remembered how much I liked
you, and now, after this, I --

16:05.498 --> 16:07.000
No, no, no!

16:07.034 --> 16:09.036
You can't have feelings
for me!

16:09.069 --> 16:10.837
I never would have had sex
with you

16:10.870 --> 16:12.339
if I knew
you actually liked me!

16:12.372 --> 16:13.806
Why?

16:13.840 --> 16:15.442
We're great together.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.044
Everybody knows that
the strongest relationships

16:17.077 --> 16:18.111
start out as friends.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.780
Mikey,
you're an amazing guy,

16:20.813 --> 16:22.849
but I'm not ready
for a relationship.

16:22.882 --> 16:26.053
In rehab, they told us
that we should wait a year

16:26.086 --> 16:28.321
until starting anything
because if it didn't work out,

16:28.355 --> 16:30.757
it could send us
right back to the bottle.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.327
That's the last thing
I want.

16:36.096 --> 16:39.032
Ohh, I'm sorry.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.833
Have I ruined everything?

16:40.867 --> 16:41.934
Yes!

16:43.336 --> 16:45.305
Look, I-I'm kidding.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.540
I'm --
Hey, I'm kidding.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.975
You didn't ruin anything.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.311
I should have told you
how I felt.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.348
Yeah, it's your fault
for being in love with me.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.017
I can't blame you,
though,

16:58.051 --> 17:00.753
me being so damn good at sex
and all.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.756
Hey! I think
I was pretty good, too.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.592
Which of my moves
was <i>your</i> favorite?

17:05.625 --> 17:08.561
The one where you called me
a goddess.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.266
I can't get less sexy.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.369
It's not the dress.
It's what's in it.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.105
I love it.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.341
Whoa.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.410
I can't believe
you fought so hard

17:23.443 --> 17:25.412
about not wearing
a bridesmaid's dress.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.779
You look great in it.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.748
I didn't put it on
because you asked.

17:28.781 --> 17:29.882
I put a poll on my Insta,

17:29.916 --> 17:31.718
and apparently a bunch
of basic bitches

17:31.751 --> 17:33.720
wanted me to perpetuate
this stupid tradition.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.656
I'm betraying my entire
generation by doing this.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.095
Well, you don't have to wear it
if you don't want to.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.797
No, no.
I'll do it for <i>you.</i>

17:46.966 --> 17:49.102
Oh, hey, Louise.
Nice dress.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.303
What happened
to the other one?

17:50.337 --> 17:52.439
You have to return it
to the house of lies?

17:52.472 --> 17:55.108
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.577
I wanted a smaller group
doing this.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.911
Well, then,
why didn't you just tell me?

17:58.945 --> 17:59.912
I would have understood.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.582
Yeah, why?
She's nice!

18:02.615 --> 18:04.784
I saw her get born!

18:04.817 --> 18:06.653
She didn't cry!

18:09.489 --> 18:11.057
Would you
have understood?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.326
Everyone was coming at me
so hard

18:13.360 --> 18:15.094
with their ideas
this morning.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.330
No one seemed to care
what <i>I</i> wanted.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.766
Oh, it's not everybody.
Be honest.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.768
You just think <i>I</i> didn't care
what you wanted.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.336
It didn't seem like
you did.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.938
You just kept pushing stuff
that <i>you</i> wanted.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.006
Oh, right.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.741
Because Darlene's
all about herself.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.777
She couldn't have possibly
wanted to do something good

18:30.810 --> 18:31.944
for somebody else.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.646
You know what?
I think they were great ideas,

18:33.680 --> 18:34.947
and if
you didn't like them,

18:34.981 --> 18:37.150
you should've had the balls
to tell me to my face

18:37.184 --> 18:38.585
instead of sneaking around
with my kids

18:38.618 --> 18:39.852
and making a fool
out of me.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.754
And if the dress is supposed
to look like that

18:41.788 --> 18:42.755
on all the bridesmaids,

18:42.789 --> 18:45.024
I better hit puberty
real damn soon!

18:47.059 --> 18:48.528
What the hell
is wrong with her?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.797
What do you think?!

18:50.830 --> 18:53.333
She has no chest!

18:53.366 --> 18:57.337
She's gonna need suspenders
to keep that dress up!

19:05.144 --> 19:07.146
I think you and Louise
should talk.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.848
Oh, well,
she's <i>your</i> bride.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.817
I don't want
nothing to do with her.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.387
I already apologized to you
for lying.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.523
I don't want all this bad blood
before the wedding.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.057
We should talk it out.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.526
Oh, there's nothing
to talk about.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.860
I mean, I was just trying
to help you.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.162
But you were so offended

19:23.196 --> 19:25.398
by the thought
of vegan Ethiopian food

19:25.432 --> 19:26.966
or a black wedding dress.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.568
I would have loved to have that
at my wedding.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.237
But it's not
your wedding.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.371
I know that, Dad.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.539
Do you, sweetie?

19:32.572 --> 19:35.342
Well, okay, yeah,
I mean, sure,

19:35.375 --> 19:37.810
these are things
that I-I might've done, too,

19:37.844 --> 19:39.712
but I'm not
getting married.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.454
Right. Yeah.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.956
I'm not getting married.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.494
You will, though.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.564
And now we're gonna know
all the things to do for you.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.833
You're still messed up
about Ben.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.870
It's gonna take some time
to let that go.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.441
I am so sorry, Louise.

20:08.475 --> 20:12.912
I...I-I can't believe
I did that.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.282
Look, I understand.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.951
And I really wanted to like
all your wack-a-doodle ideas.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.587
It's just not me.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.955
I just want you to know

20:22.989 --> 20:25.692
that this all started
because you're so great.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.594
My mom's gone,

20:27.627 --> 20:31.764
and I just wanted to get closer
so we could talk about stuff.

20:31.798 --> 20:36.068
I have so much toxic baggage
to share with you.

20:36.102 --> 20:40.440
And I can't wait to hear
all your toxic baggage

20:40.473 --> 20:43.310
and to share
all <i>my</i> toxic baggage with you.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.146
You know,
after it leaves the room.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.415
You want me to leave

20:48.448 --> 20:50.883
before you have
your big, weepy girl talk?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.885
Please can I stay?
No? Okay.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.125
Whatcha doing?

21:00.327 --> 21:02.795
Oh, Louise asked me to pick out
some centerpieces.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.432
Ah, snooze!

21:05.465 --> 21:08.901
I had sober sex
with Mikey.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.102
Wow!

21:10.136 --> 21:12.939
When you make amends,
you don't go halfway.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.106
How was it?

21:14.140 --> 21:15.308
Great.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.744
Turns out
I'm really good at sex.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.479
Oh, well,
there's your next career.

21:19.512 --> 21:22.615
Do what you love, you never work
a day in your life.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.451
Jealous?

21:24.484 --> 21:26.319
Always.
