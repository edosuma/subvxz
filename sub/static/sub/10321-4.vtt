12:41.528 --> 12:43.997
I wish we could go uphill
on the way back.

12:44.031 --> 12:47.100
[ Earl Narrating ] All I had
to do was seem interested
in the things she liked doing,

12:47.134 --> 12:49.369
and she started to cheer up.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.438
Hiking turned into
arts and crafts.

12:51.471 --> 12:55.375
I started to, uh, make you
a magical fairy,

12:55.408 --> 12:59.847
but I ended up with,
uh, a magical clump.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.850
Thanks.
It's a very nice clump.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.921
I'll name him Alexander.
Alexander the Clump.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.257
Or Pepe.
How about Pepe the Clump?

13:11.892 --> 13:14.928
- I don't get it. Why Pepe?
- Oh, Pepe's a name.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.297
I think it's Mexican.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.301
Jose, Rodrigo, Pepe.
Yeah, it's Mexican.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.004
[ Earl Narrating ]
Papier-mâchéin'
turned into picnickin'.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.307
For smelling like feet,
this cheese is pretty damn good.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.544
I love you.
What?

13:31.578 --> 13:34.114
[ Earl Narrating ]
Then our picnic somehow
turned into a relationship.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.550
I don't ever want you
to think you're not good enough
for me again.

13:37.584 --> 13:42.222
You're perfect for me.
My little butterfly flew away,
but he came back.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.391
He came back.

13:44.424 --> 13:48.161
[ Earl Narrating ]
And like a butterfly,
I too was trapped.

13:48.195 --> 13:52.565
But instead of a net,
I was caught by a crazy girl
wiping her nose on me.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.612
She told me she loves me.
What?

14:05.645 --> 14:08.882
I was nice to her
like you told me to,
and she told me she loved me.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.418
She even rubbed her nose
against mine, real soft.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.387
What'd that feel like?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.556
It tickled for a second,
but then it itched.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.126
You must have been
too nice to her.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.528
Too nice?
You didn't tell me how nice
to be to her.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.264
You just told me to be nice.
She thinks we're back together.

14:24.297 --> 14:28.368
Hey, Earl,
is there a condom machine
around here?

14:28.401 --> 14:32.973
- No, Dirk.
- Hey, what are these?

14:33.006 --> 14:37.310
- Shower caps.
- That could work.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.580
Hey, Earl, you want me to tell
Natalie you're dead again?

14:40.613 --> 14:44.251
You can't do that.
What am I supposed
to do then, huh?

14:44.284 --> 14:47.154
I don't wanna hurt
her feelings, but how am I
supposed to get rid of her?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.356
She's been kicked around
by men her whole life.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.159
You have to give her
the power.
Let her break up with you.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.495
She won't do that.
Thanks to you,
I'm her nature-hiking,

14:55.528 --> 14:59.099
papier-mâchéing,
soft-nose-rubbing butterfly
in shining armor.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.135
So change.
Be a bad boyfriend.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.038
Bad boyfriend?
It's not that easy.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.507
Being mean
goes against everything
I stand for these days.

15:09.176 --> 15:12.079
Hey, Catalina,
the mouse catcher's full again.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.381
[ Earl Narrating ]
I knew being a bad guy
was gonna be hard,

15:14.414 --> 15:18.318
but since Catalina said
it was for Natalie's own good,
I gave it my all.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.688
- Hey, look at
the pretty yellow flowers.
- Aw.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.395
Happy Fourth of July!

15:30.263 --> 15:32.432
Check it out.
I made your bust.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.668
I upped you a cup.
You're welcome.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.110
Aahh!

15:43.143 --> 15:47.147
Excuse me.
[ Grunting ]

15:47.180 --> 15:49.349
[ Belching ]

15:49.382 --> 15:52.519
[ Zipper Unzipping ]
Honey, you think
it might be better...

15:52.552 --> 15:54.487
to relieve yourself
a little farther away
from the blanket?

15:54.521 --> 15:56.323
Nah.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.028
[ Earl Narrating ]
This poor girl was so insecure,

16:01.061 --> 16:02.562
there wasn't anything
she wouldn't put up with.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.068
Did you throw away my junk?

16:08.101 --> 16:10.637
[ Earl Narrating ]
Nothing worked,
and I was running out of ideas,

16:10.670 --> 16:14.507
so Catalina agreed to help me
put an end to the whole thing
once and for all.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.644
[ Earl ]
Come in.
Oh, yeah, mama!

16:17.677 --> 16:21.048
- [ Grunting, Laughing ]
- Earl, what's going on?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.418
Oh, just blowing off
a little steam,
having a good time.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.188
Can't a guy
have a party around here
without getting hassled?

16:28.221 --> 16:30.723
Pssh!
Get off my back.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.394
[ Catalina Giggling ]
You're right, Earl.
Sorry for interrupting.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.196
Just have fun and call me
when you're done.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.234
"Call me when you're done"?
I'm in bed with another woman.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.703
Don't you wanna slap me?
Do you want me to?

16:43.736 --> 16:46.073
Oh!

16:46.106 --> 16:48.141
Natalie, this is not working.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.110
Remember when I said
it wasn't you, it was me?

16:50.143 --> 16:53.146
Well, it's not me, it's you.
It's all you.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.315
Earl--
No, no, no, no.
I'm done listening to you.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.718
You're just as crazy
as she is.

16:58.751 --> 17:02.455
The truth is, you're clingy,
you're a doormat,
you have no self-respect.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.825
That's why guys wanna leave you.
They have to get away from you.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.095
That's why I'm trying to
get you to break up with me now.

17:10.863 --> 17:15.335
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe it is you,
because Dirk didn't think
I was a doormat.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.105
He didn't wanna leave me.
He loved me for who I am.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.510
[ Gasps ]

17:32.485 --> 17:34.821
Hey, Earl.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.324
Are there no other motels
in this town?

17:37.357 --> 17:40.193
Well, that went well.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.695
I know I was hard on her,
but she needed
to hear the truth.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.365
And when she's over
being upset,

17:45.398 --> 17:48.201
it's gonna make her
a better person
for the rest of her life.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.204
[ Earl Narrating ]
As it turned out, the rest
of her life wasn't that long.

17:51.238 --> 17:54.807
Sadly, Natalie's parents
told me she was
so distraught over yet...

17:54.841 --> 17:58.211
another relationship ending
that she took her own life.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.148
[ Woman Sobbing ]

18:04.717 --> 18:07.554
[ All Gasping ]

18:09.922 --> 18:12.792
Yes, yes, yes!
Who's the joke on now,
Earl Hickey?

18:12.825 --> 18:15.295
- Who's the joke on now?
- Me?

18:15.328 --> 18:18.631
That's right. Y-O-U.
How does it feel, huh?

18:18.665 --> 18:21.801
- How does it feel
to think someone's dead?
- Crappy?

18:21.834 --> 18:26.606
Crappy's right.
That's exactly how
you made me feel, Earl, twice.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.143
[ Earl Narrating ]
It turned out that Catalina
and I were both kinda right.

18:30.177 --> 18:33.680
By being honest with Natalie,
I made her mad.
[ Grunts ]

18:33.713 --> 18:36.316
That anger gave her the idea
to fake her death,
and by doing that,

18:36.349 --> 18:40.287
she finally got to leave
a relationship with the power
that Catalina said she needed.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.190
Natalie had finally stood up
for herself,
and I admired her for that.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.758
Although her parents
had a different opinion.

18:45.792 --> 18:50.430
You could have at least told us
you were faking!

18:50.463 --> 18:53.900
- It had to seem real, Mom.
Lighten up.
- [ Murmuring ]

18:53.933 --> 18:56.736
Oh, she's alive!
[ Yelling ]

18:56.769 --> 18:59.672
[ Earl Narrating ]
Clearly, Natalie had finally
found her backbone.

18:59.706 --> 19:03.876
And as I had hoped,
it carried on past her funeral
and into the rest of her life.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.214
Hey, Dirk, I'm still
getting your mail.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.919
It's from the clinic.
Somebody got themselves
an S.T.D.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.488
- I can deal with that.
- Turn the page.

19:18.525 --> 19:23.530
Aw, crap!
Damn shower caps.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.266
[ Earl Narrating ]
Her newfound confidence
even let her finally showcase...

19:26.299 --> 19:28.235
her wet newspaper art
in a public setting.

19:38.978 --> 19:44.651
[ Earl Narrating ]
And because I'd earned it,
karma finally let me find a pen.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.543
It was nice to see Natalie
so happy, wasn't it?

20:10.577 --> 20:13.613
Yeah. I'm glad
she's not dead anymore.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.383
Being dead is definitely worse
than being alive.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.451
When you're dead,
you can't do
all the cool stuff...

20:18.485 --> 20:20.587
you can do
when you're alive.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.291
You and I, we can do
all kinds of cool stuff,
cause we're living.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.559
We're not dead.
We're alive.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.496
If we were dead,
we wouldn't be able
to do all the cool stuff...

20:29.529 --> 20:31.798
we can do
because we're alive.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.267
Dead people
can't do cool stuff.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.904
Only people that are alive
can do cool stuff,
because they're living,

20:37.937 --> 20:40.773
and you have to be living
to be able to do cool stuff.

20:40.807 --> 20:44.277
You have to be alive.

20:44.311 --> 20:48.681
Yeah, except when you're alive,
sometimes bad stuff happens too.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.918
Like, sometimes you can
get in a car wreck
or you can have a headache...

20:51.951 --> 20:54.854
or twist your ankle
or even stub your big toe.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.290
So being alive's
kinda hard too,

20:57.324 --> 20:59.726
but I think it's definitely
better than being "a-dead."
