00:19.828 --> 00:21.928
So, Grandma's birthday is coming up.

00:21.963 --> 00:24.130
Boom. Another one on the
scorecard for Gram Gram.

00:24.165 --> 00:26.733
She's still alive and
probably shouldn't drive.

00:26.768 --> 00:28.434
But you know those handmade gifts

00:28.470 --> 00:30.069
you make for your grandma every year?

00:30.105 --> 00:31.637
Know 'em? I half-ass 'em.

00:31.673 --> 00:33.439
Yes, and she notices.

00:33.475 --> 00:35.308
I didn't half-ass it. I made Grandma

00:35.343 --> 00:37.377
a pretty great necklace last year.

00:37.422 --> 00:39.853
One noodle on a string
does not a necklace make.

00:39.888 --> 00:42.158
Listen, Grandma could die this year.

00:42.183 --> 00:43.449
I mean, we don't know.

00:43.485 --> 00:46.119
- Bob.
- I'm not saying she's going to.

00:46.154 --> 00:48.265
- Yeah, it's exactly what you said.
- LINDA: God forbid.

00:48.289 --> 00:50.757
If she did die, it would be horrible.

00:50.792 --> 00:52.892
O-Obviously. And you kids wouldn't want

00:52.927 --> 00:55.561
the last thing she saw
to be your crappy gifts.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.597
Point is, no half-assing it this year.

00:57.632 --> 00:59.664
Wait, did she like what
I got her last year?

00:59.689 --> 01:01.334
- What was it again?
- A shell.

01:01.403 --> 01:03.336
- A shell?
- Yeah, a shell, uh, and...

01:03.379 --> 01:05.245
You know what, never
mind. I can beat it.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.340
And my dad's birthday's
coming up, too, you know.

01:07.382 --> 01:10.176
Handmade gifts
for multiple grandparents.

01:10.211 --> 01:12.912
Huh, wow. I guess we'll
just take a sabbatical

01:12.947 --> 01:15.181
from the slop shop to get all that done.

01:15.216 --> 01:17.650
Just make the gifts.
It's part of being a kid.

01:17.685 --> 01:19.652
The worst part of being a kid.

01:19.687 --> 01:21.788
Besides being scared
the drain in the bathtub

01:21.823 --> 01:22.989
will eat your penis.

01:23.024 --> 01:24.323
(frightened groan)

01:24.359 --> 01:26.257
Aw, poor Genie's weenie.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.262
It's forced labor.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.130
It's like when they
make elephants paint.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.199
Ugh, I wish I could paint
like those elephants.

01:33.234 --> 01:35.034
Check out this burnt Tater Tot, J-Ju.

01:35.070 --> 01:36.636
- Wow.
- I like it cooked,

01:36.671 --> 01:38.037
not cooked in a kiln.

01:38.073 --> 01:39.205
(chuckles) I mean, come on.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.207
- What's a kiln?
- What's a kiln?

01:41.242 --> 01:42.708
You never been to Color Me Mine?

01:42.751 --> 01:44.284
That's where I colored you yours.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.312
Wait, the kiln, of course.

01:46.347 --> 01:48.548
The Legend of the Lost Ceramics Room.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.616
The Legend of the Lost Ceramics Room?

01:50.652 --> 01:52.185
I'm not familiar with that one.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.486
- Really?
- Seriously?

01:53.521 --> 01:54.854
How do you not know about that?

01:54.889 --> 01:56.556
Everyone knows about that.

01:56.591 --> 01:58.124
I... Well, I don't, okay?

01:58.159 --> 02:00.860
Do you not talk to people
on the playground, or...

02:00.895 --> 02:02.306
- Can you just tell me, please?
- Okay.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.330
According to the legend
that Wagstaff kids

02:04.365 --> 02:05.731
have told each other for decades...

02:05.767 --> 02:08.501
- Every kid but you, apparently.
- Yeah, I get it.

02:08.536 --> 02:10.235
It all happened forever ago,

02:10.270 --> 02:12.038
in, like, the '80s.

02:12.073 --> 02:15.341
Back when Huey and Carl
Lewis ruled the world.

02:15.376 --> 02:17.577
<i>LOUISE: Wagstaff had
a ceramics class then.</i>

02:17.612 --> 02:20.643
<i>Kids were making stuff with
clay all day, every day.</i>

02:20.668 --> 02:22.682
<i>But then, over one weekend,</i>

02:22.717 --> 02:24.016
<i>there was a kiln fire.</i>

02:24.052 --> 02:25.384
<i>Sprinklers put it out,</i>

02:25.420 --> 02:27.053
<i>but it was a huge smoky mess.</i>

02:27.088 --> 02:28.688
<i>GENE: Like Winston Churchill.</i>

02:28.723 --> 02:30.401
<i>LOUISE: On Monday,
there was supposed to be</i>

02:30.425 --> 02:31.902
<i>some big school board
inspection or something,</i>

02:31.933 --> 02:33.566
- <i>so instead of cleaning the place up,</i>
- _

02:33.595 --> 02:35.728
<i>what does the principal do? He panics.</i>

02:35.763 --> 02:37.408
<i>He and the janitor and
the janitor's brother</i>

02:37.432 --> 02:39.432
<i>slap a wall where the door used to be.</i>

02:39.467 --> 02:40.678
<i>- GENE: Wall slap.
- LOUISE: One day,</i>

02:40.702 --> 02:42.001
the ceramics room is there,

02:42.036 --> 02:44.003
the next day, it's not.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.771
All the pinch pots, all the vases,

02:45.807 --> 02:49.125
all the cool Papa Smurf
sculptures... sealed inside.

02:49.157 --> 02:51.286
- You think that really happened?
- What if it did?

02:51.311 --> 02:54.091
What if we could find it?
We wouldn't have to make any gifts,

02:54.116 --> 02:57.017
because some kids in the '80s
already made 'em for us.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.918
- I don't know.
- All we got to do

02:58.953 --> 03:01.216
is figure out where this lost room is,

03:01.241 --> 03:03.222
knock a hole in the
wall... We're in, we're out.

03:03.258 --> 03:04.790
Bing, bang, boom.

03:04.826 --> 03:07.126
Seems like a lot of work
to avoid making some gifts.

03:07.162 --> 03:09.140
Plus, how do you even look
for a lost ceramics room?

03:09.164 --> 03:12.098
Ugh, I think we're gonna
have to talk to grown-ups.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.433
<i>More like groan-ups.</i>

03:14.469 --> 03:18.804
An art program at
Wagstaff? That's hilarious.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.574
- It rings a bell.
- (school bell rings)

03:21.609 --> 03:23.309
That was unrelated.

03:23.344 --> 03:24.911
That legend's not true.

03:24.946 --> 03:26.879
And I was a student at
Wagstaff around that time,

03:26.915 --> 03:29.390
so I would know.
A pretty cool student, too.

03:29.415 --> 03:31.984
Ever hear of the seventh
grade class secretary?

03:32.020 --> 03:34.906
'Cause I was elected that.

03:34.931 --> 03:36.455
Hidden room? The only thing hidden

03:36.491 --> 03:38.906
in this school is my
personal toilet paper.

03:38.931 --> 03:40.893
Ah, I've said too much!

03:40.929 --> 03:42.895
- (entry bells jingle)
- Hey.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.009
Uh, you wouldn't mind if I
worked on a little side project

03:45.033 --> 03:46.465
while I'm eating, would you?

03:46.501 --> 03:48.279
- Yeah, sure, it's okay, yeah.
- Uh, maybe not.

03:48.303 --> 03:50.503
Great. Uh, plug this
guy in for me, will you?

03:50.538 --> 03:53.172
The only outlet is by the coffee maker.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.441
- It's kind of inconvenient.
- Perfect. Plug her in.

03:55.476 --> 03:56.676
- Mm-hmm.
- I got it.

03:56.711 --> 03:58.277
What's your side business, Teddy?

03:58.313 --> 04:00.746
Oh, I'm replacing cracked
cell phone screens.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.026
Been doing it a couple of months now.

04:02.050 --> 04:03.983
It's fun, but it's kind of lonely

04:04.018 --> 04:05.618
at my house, alone.

04:05.653 --> 04:07.987
I bet. -Uh-huh. You're
really spreading out there.

04:08.022 --> 04:10.100
Oh, yeah, you gotta, when
you're working with this many

04:10.124 --> 04:12.291
bits and pieces, you know,
you got to spread it out.

04:12.327 --> 04:13.938
I mean, but it's, like,
three seats, Teddy,

04:13.962 --> 04:15.306
- plus the light.
- It's fine, it's fine.

04:15.330 --> 04:16.495
Mm-hmm.

04:16.531 --> 04:17.531
Oops, ah.

04:17.565 --> 04:19.276
I dropped a little
screw behind the counter.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.711
You mind grabbing that for me, Bobby?

04:20.735 --> 04:22.201
You want to borrow my visor?

04:22.237 --> 04:23.502
- Not really.
- You see it?

04:23.538 --> 04:25.504
No, I just see floor right now.

04:25.540 --> 04:26.980
Yeah, you should really use my visor.

04:27.008 --> 04:28.128
I-I don't want to, Teddy.

04:28.153 --> 04:30.109
- Ooh, is that it?
- No, that's dirt.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.844
- Is that it?
- No, that's...

04:31.879 --> 04:34.013
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- Oh. Oh, gross.

04:34.048 --> 04:36.882
(groans) Okay, I think
I got it. Here you go.

04:36.918 --> 04:39.385
Thanks. Heh-heh. Whoa,
I dropped it again.

04:39.420 --> 04:40.886
- Bob, you mind?
- Mm-hmm.

04:40.922 --> 04:41.984
- It's a screw. It's little.
- Mm-hmm.

04:42.009 --> 04:43.656
I know, I just got it.

04:43.691 --> 04:45.491
Is it true? I don't know.

04:45.526 --> 04:48.227
If it's a weird, creepy
legend, then it's probably true.

04:48.263 --> 04:49.495
You should go look for it.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.041
What else are you doing with your time?

04:51.065 --> 04:52.798
- But how?
- You need to find someone

04:52.834 --> 04:54.133
that took ceramics then.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.368
How do we do that?

04:55.403 --> 04:57.036
Well, how the hell would I know?!

04:57.071 --> 04:59.972
Whoa, whoa, can I see your
coffee mug for a second?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.475
It's not coffee, but I guess
a sip wouldn't kill you.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.377
Who's Rose Reynolds?

05:04.412 --> 05:06.679
Beats me. It's a mug
from the faculty lounge.

05:06.714 --> 05:08.414
You think I buy my own mugs?

05:08.449 --> 05:12.218
It looks like old Rose
Reynolds made this mug in '83.

05:12.253 --> 05:13.719
She might remember something.

05:13.755 --> 05:15.888
- 1983, though, right?
- Yes, Tina.

05:15.923 --> 05:18.170
Cool, cool. I thought maybe 1883,

05:18.195 --> 05:20.493
but that's ridiculous. Too long ago.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.952
Yes, that's pretty
much how I remember it.

05:22.977 --> 05:24.897
There was a ceramics room on Friday,

05:24.932 --> 05:27.667
then on Monday, it was
gone... Just walled up.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.168
Now, Rose, at the time,

05:29.203 --> 05:31.270
had Taco Tuesday been invented yet?

05:31.306 --> 05:32.505
I want to say it had.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.901
Thank you. No further questions.

05:33.926 --> 05:36.676
Wow. Okay, so they
sealed all the ceramics

05:36.711 --> 05:38.377
and pottery in the room?

05:38.413 --> 05:40.880
Yeah. I know for sure I
made a couple Monchhichi mugs

05:40.915 --> 05:42.214
I never got back.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.450
So it's true. The legend's all true.

05:44.485 --> 05:46.786
Now, can you remember
where the room was?

05:46.821 --> 05:49.555
Hmm, I think it was
on the second floor...

05:49.590 --> 05:52.058
No, the first. The third. Maybe.

05:52.093 --> 05:54.727
So first, second, or
third floor. Got it.

05:54.762 --> 05:57.430
I might have an old
yearbook, if that'll help.

05:57.465 --> 05:58.631
I think we're done here.

05:58.666 --> 06:01.133
Geez, we were leaving anyway.

06:01.169 --> 06:04.537
- No, I mean we are done here.
- (all cry out)

06:04.572 --> 06:05.938
- Hi.
- Thank you, sweetie.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.239
You were so still in there.

06:07.275 --> 06:09.075
That's where kids come from?

06:09.110 --> 06:11.477
No, that's where kids end
up, if they're my kids.

06:11.512 --> 06:13.379
We make piñatas of ourselves.

06:13.421 --> 06:15.788
It's fun. Do your parents
not do this to you?

06:15.817 --> 06:18.484
- Um, no.
- Uh, can we get that yearbook?

06:18.519 --> 06:20.486
I feel like we were
lucky to get out of there

06:20.528 --> 06:21.961
without getting kid-yata'd.

06:21.989 --> 06:24.290
Hey, look, Frond was
seventh grade secretary.

06:24.325 --> 06:27.326
<i>- GENE: More like sexy-tary.</i>
- Hold on, these kids are walking

06:27.362 --> 06:30.229
- out of this room carrying pottery.
- TINA: Okay.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.797
If we can figure out where this was,

06:31.833 --> 06:33.899
we'll find the lost ceramics room.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.768
- And maybe ourselves.
- Guys,

06:35.803 --> 06:37.803
Rose didn't just give us an old yearbook

06:37.839 --> 06:40.606
with so many pictures of skinny ties.

06:40.641 --> 06:43.129
She gave us a treasure map.

06:45.293 --> 06:47.183
Maybe this is the hallway.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.641
Mm, not so sure.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.885
That picture's in black and white,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.403
and our school is in color.

06:51.426 --> 06:53.870
Even if we find the ceramics
room and it's full of ceramics,

06:53.895 --> 06:55.306
wouldn't we be giving our grandparents

06:55.330 --> 06:57.330
handmade gifts that we didn't hand-make?

06:57.373 --> 07:00.207
Tina, Tina, Tina, do you love
Grandma and Grandpa or not?

07:00.235 --> 07:01.801
- Yeah.
- I love them,

07:01.837 --> 07:03.370
<i>but I'm not in love with them.</i>

07:03.415 --> 07:04.881
Hmm, this doesn't line up.

07:04.906 --> 07:06.306
Let's try the hallways upstairs.

07:07.976 --> 07:10.377
LOUISE: Oh, there's a
stairwell there. Nope.

07:10.412 --> 07:12.679
TINA: Hmm, not a match, right?

07:12.714 --> 07:14.370
Call the whole thing
off? Good idea. I agree.

07:14.395 --> 07:16.116
Wait a minute. This lines up.

07:16.151 --> 07:18.318
There used to be a door
where those lockers are.

07:18.353 --> 07:21.154
They must have put in lockers
over the wall at some point.

07:21.189 --> 07:22.989
(laughs) We found it.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.492
Okay, we can't cut
through those lockers,

07:25.527 --> 07:27.861
but we can cut through... there.

07:27.896 --> 07:29.362
That's where we dig.

07:29.398 --> 07:31.831
Where's where you dig?
What are you digging?

07:31.867 --> 07:35.335
We're digging school
in general, Mr. Frond.

07:35.370 --> 07:36.569
We're digging all of it.

07:36.605 --> 07:38.972
The whole vibe. And you... you're great.

07:39.007 --> 07:40.640
- Big fan.
- All right, then.

07:40.676 --> 07:43.176
Well, better get back
to guidancing, you.

07:43.211 --> 07:44.978
The world needs that
stuff more than ever.

07:45.013 --> 07:46.379
It really does.

07:46.415 --> 07:48.715
- It really does, Mr. Frond.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.318
- My goodness.
- Phew, that was a close one.

07:51.353 --> 07:53.553
Was it just me, or did he
hardly have any cat hair

07:53.588 --> 07:54.821
on his sweater today?

07:54.856 --> 07:56.222
Oh, it's all on his back.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.590
We're so close, guys.

07:57.626 --> 07:59.392
At lunch, no one will
be in that classroom.

07:59.428 --> 08:00.872
That's when we crack through the wall,

08:00.896 --> 08:02.395
into the ceramics room.

08:02.431 --> 08:05.265
Eh, lunchtime is no good
for me; I eat lunch then.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.242
- Gene.
- Okay, okay. I'll make it work.

08:09.871 --> 08:11.604
- TEDDY: Psst. Bobby.
- Yeah.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.406
- Bob.
- I'm right here. I can see you.

08:13.442 --> 08:15.041
Look at all these customers, huh?

08:15.077 --> 08:16.772
For me and for you.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.411
- Right? Huh?
- Uh, yeah.

08:18.447 --> 08:20.914
I mean, it's two customers,
but it's-it's good for business.

08:20.949 --> 08:22.849
Well, I'm gonna get back to cooking.

08:22.884 --> 08:25.083
- Yeah. I'm gonna get back
to my business, too. - Okay.

08:25.108 --> 08:26.086
- Right?
- Great.

08:26.121 --> 08:27.465
You're working, I'm working, right?

08:27.489 --> 08:28.855
Yeah, in the same place.

08:28.890 --> 08:31.057
We could probably split a business card.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.892
You got to order, like, 300 of 'em...

08:32.928 --> 08:34.472
I got to get back to work, Teddy.
-... at a time. Okay.

08:34.496 --> 08:36.296
- So do you.
- Oh, I'll see you around.

08:37.999 --> 08:39.698
Just saying, the cafeteria

08:39.735 --> 08:41.967
is wildly unprepared for a to-go order.

08:42.003 --> 08:44.437
- It's embarrassing.
- Okay, that's the spot.

08:44.473 --> 08:46.206
Here, chisel away.

08:46.241 --> 08:47.941
A stapler and a pen?

08:47.976 --> 08:49.820
- Short notice, okay?
- Why do I have to do it?

08:49.845 --> 08:52.645
You're the strongest;
you've got puberty strength.

08:52.681 --> 08:54.614
Guys, there's no way this
is even going to work.

08:54.649 --> 08:56.950
- It's working.
- Oh, my God, these walls are crap.

08:56.985 --> 08:58.551
Okay. I think we have a peephole.

08:58.587 --> 09:00.053
Peephole, peephole, please!

09:00.088 --> 09:03.056
All right. Let's see some treasure.

09:03.091 --> 09:06.259
No, no, no, no. A broom closet?!

09:06.294 --> 09:07.888
Hold on.

09:07.913 --> 09:09.996
(footsteps retreating, door opening)

09:10.031 --> 09:12.091
How's your day going?

09:12.116 --> 09:14.167
It's okay. It's a lot of this.

09:14.202 --> 09:17.170
Boy, do you guys look stupid
for digging through that wall.

09:17.205 --> 09:19.606
- Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burg...
- Welcome to Teddy's iScreen,

09:19.641 --> 09:22.575
You Screen, We All
Screen for iScreen Repair.

09:22.611 --> 09:24.322
- Teddy, what are you doing?
- What? We don't know

09:24.346 --> 09:26.090
if the guy is here for
your business or mine.

09:26.114 --> 09:27.947
- I'm here for a quick burger.
- Got it.

09:27.983 --> 09:29.916
And how's your cell phone
screen? Is it cracked?

09:29.951 --> 09:32.130
- D-Does it have only...
- Uh, uh, take a seat anywhere. Sorry.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.998
- (quietly): Teddy, please.
- Right, right, sorry.

09:34.022 --> 09:35.700
I'm gonna go ahead and
get back to work, Bobby.

09:35.724 --> 09:36.934
- Um, wh-wh-what is that?
- (jazz music plays)

09:36.958 --> 09:38.525
It's a little background music.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.538
Helps me focus when I'm
working on the detailed stuff.

09:40.562 --> 09:42.362
- I-Is it okay?
- Uh, n-n... uh, no.

09:42.397 --> 09:43.797
Of course it's okay.

09:43.865 --> 09:45.365
It's fine. It's-it's jazzy.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.695
Yeah, I-it's jazz. Jazzy jazz.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.169
It doesn't even have any words.

09:49.204 --> 09:51.104
- All right, fine.
- I appreciate it, Bob.

09:51.139 --> 09:52.705
Now I can get back in the zone.

09:52.741 --> 09:55.975
(scatting)

09:56.011 --> 09:57.710
- Teddy.
- (continues scatting)

09:57.746 --> 09:59.846
Teddy. Teddy.

09:59.881 --> 10:01.681
- Teddy.
- What? What?

10:01.716 --> 10:04.784
- What? - It doesn't have no
words if you're singing words.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.319
- I was singing?
- Yes, you were.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.154
- Oh.
- It was nice. - (Bob groans)

10:08.190 --> 10:10.824
Sorry about that. I d... I
didn't realize I was doing that.

10:10.859 --> 10:12.826
(scatting)

10:12.861 --> 10:14.627
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry.

10:14.663 --> 10:17.163
That was me again. (chuckles, sighs)

10:17.199 --> 10:19.931
(scatting)

10:19.956 --> 10:21.334
Oh, my God.

10:21.369 --> 10:24.137
- (school bell ringing)
- So I guess the legend is just

10:24.172 --> 10:26.139
a stupid legend after all.

10:26.174 --> 10:28.219
And we're gonna have to
make gifts with our own hands

10:28.243 --> 10:30.143
like a bunch of not-lazy children.

10:30.178 --> 10:32.078
I like these old yearbook pictures.

10:32.113 --> 10:33.646
Everyone's hair had so much body.

10:33.682 --> 10:36.015
And everyone's bodies had so much hair.

10:36.051 --> 10:37.717
That's weird. If you look really close

10:37.752 --> 10:39.352
at the picture of the ceramics room,

10:39.387 --> 10:41.254
the exit sign in the
background is backwards.

10:41.289 --> 10:44.310
Cool. I like it when an
exit sign isn't too obvious.

10:44.335 --> 10:45.525
Let me see that.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.260
Holy crap.

10:47.295 --> 10:50.163
The exit sign isn't backwards,
the picture is flopped.

10:50.198 --> 10:52.599
<i>The kid wasn't leaving
from there with pottery.</i>

10:52.634 --> 10:54.501
He was leaving from there.

10:54.536 --> 10:55.835
Whoa. That changes things.

10:55.871 --> 10:57.114
So we'd need to go through either

10:57.138 --> 10:59.517
- the science room...
- TINA: Which has clubs every lunch.

10:59.541 --> 11:01.953
- LOUISE: ... or math.
- Which has tutoring every lunch.

11:01.977 --> 11:03.676
- It's full of toots.
- Or...

11:03.712 --> 11:05.545
we dig through the lockers.

11:05.570 --> 11:07.847
You want to dig through steel lockers?

11:07.883 --> 11:09.048
Destroy school property?

11:09.084 --> 11:10.550
Definitely don't do that.

11:10.585 --> 11:12.390
(whispering): Do that. Do that.

11:15.039 --> 11:16.838
GENE: Good afternoon, Theodore.

11:16.874 --> 11:18.694
Mr. B, Mrs. B.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.052
Hey, how are your gifts
for your grandparents going?

11:21.088 --> 11:22.687
Great. We are plugging away.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.422
Yeah? You've been working on 'em?

11:24.458 --> 11:27.025
'Cause I don't remember
seeing you working on them.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.605
- Oh, yeah. - Oh, a
lot. - Too much, maybe.

11:28.629 --> 11:30.095
Speaking of which, uh, Teddy,

11:30.130 --> 11:32.430
we have a quick handyman
question for you.

11:32.466 --> 11:34.099
- Got a sec?
- Shoot.

11:34.134 --> 11:36.668
How would one go about
cutting through a steel locker

11:36.703 --> 11:38.103
and the drywall behind it?

11:38.138 --> 11:39.386
What do you need to do all that for?

11:39.411 --> 11:41.439
We dropped a penny back there.

11:41.475 --> 11:42.841
Sure, I could loan you some stuff.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.543
TEDDY: Well, first thing I'd do is drill

11:44.578 --> 11:47.345
three or four holes about
a 16th of an inch apart

11:47.381 --> 11:49.114
- with this guy here.
- (grunts)

11:49.149 --> 11:50.882
- Hold onto that.
- He's heavy.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.195
You're perforating the metal with that.

11:52.219 --> 11:54.753
And then I would use a screwdriver
to pry open a larger hole.

11:54.788 --> 11:56.299
Wh-Why don't I hold that one? And he...

11:56.323 --> 11:58.223
- and we'll give this one to Tina.
- Then, Gene,

11:58.265 --> 12:00.566
you hold the, Ba-Ba-da-da.. Tin snips.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.394
- Tin snips.
- Like cutting paper,

12:02.429 --> 12:03.929
but about a million times harder.

12:03.964 --> 12:05.742
Peel back the metal,
then use this keyhole saw

12:05.766 --> 12:07.399
to get through the drywall,

12:07.434 --> 12:09.245
and before you know it,
you've got your penny back.

12:09.269 --> 12:10.969
- Good luck, kids.
- Teddy,

12:11.004 --> 12:13.728
you're the dangerous
uncle we've always wanted.

12:14.579 --> 12:16.107
We appreciate you temporarily

12:16.143 --> 12:17.809
switching lockers, Pocket-Sized Rudy.

12:17.844 --> 12:19.044
Sure thing, guys.

12:19.079 --> 12:20.445
It's a top locker, s... um,

12:20.480 --> 12:22.547
so it might be a tough reach.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.616
- Um...
- You'll do great, kid.

12:24.651 --> 12:26.151
All right.

12:26.186 --> 12:28.320
It's gonna get real
loud real quick in here.

12:28.355 --> 12:30.644
- Tell Gene to start.
- Yep. All right, Gene, hit it.

12:30.669 --> 12:32.924
Okey doke. Welcome to the gong show.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.328
Anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes
of me hitting this gong.

12:36.363 --> 12:38.763
I wish I would've brought
my gong so we could jam.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.231
The one day I don't bring it.

12:40.267 --> 12:42.400
Second verse, same as the first.

12:42.436 --> 12:44.569
One hole down. Lots to go.

12:44.605 --> 12:47.305
Also, power tools are the
best things in the world.

12:47.341 --> 12:49.218
We could have already made
so many gifts, just saying.

12:49.242 --> 12:51.089
Can't hear you!

12:51.603 --> 12:53.302
Oh, a-are you in there, Lin?

12:53.347 --> 12:54.746
TEDDY: No, it's me. Teddy.

12:54.781 --> 12:57.315
Teddy? Thi-This is
the employee bathroom.

12:57.351 --> 13:00.352
- Yeah, I know. -
You're-you're not an employee.

13:00.379 --> 13:01.957
TEDDY: Right. I was gonna
use the customer bathroom,

13:01.989 --> 13:03.355
but then I thought, eh,

13:03.390 --> 13:04.934
I got to keep that
open for our customers.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.192
Uh-huh. But now I can't
use my own bathroom.

13:07.227 --> 13:09.527
Yeah, right. (chuckles)
Well, here we are.

13:09.563 --> 13:11.296
- Yep.
- I'll be quick.

13:11.331 --> 13:13.331
- Don't worry about it, Bobby.
- That'd be great.

13:13.367 --> 13:14.532
(Teddy scatting)

13:14.601 --> 13:15.778
- (toilet flushes)
- Oh, my God.

13:15.802 --> 13:17.202
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

13:17.237 --> 13:18.861
Is there a plunger in
here I'm not seeing?

13:18.886 --> 13:20.017
- Teddy, I don't like that question.
- Uh...

13:20.042 --> 13:22.050
Okay, what are you
doing in there, Teddy?

13:22.075 --> 13:23.453
- I'm finishing up, I'm finishing up.
- Uh...

13:23.477 --> 13:24.554
- Okay, just get out now.
- There's water everywhere!

13:24.578 --> 13:25.543
Oh, God, there's water everywhere.

13:25.579 --> 13:26.978
Unlock the door, Teddy!

13:27.014 --> 13:28.658
Ah, it's locked! How do
you open this thing, Bobby?

13:28.682 --> 13:30.382
I'm gonna break it down!

13:30.417 --> 13:31.894
- No, don't break the door, Teddy!
- I'm gonna...

13:31.918 --> 13:34.364
- I got water all over my shoes!
- Just unlock it, and I'll open it!

13:34.388 --> 13:35.687
I'm getting water all over my...

13:35.722 --> 13:38.356
(Tina straining)

13:38.392 --> 13:40.191
LOUISE: How's it going in there, T?

13:40.227 --> 13:45.330
This metal knows we are
wrong to seek the treasure.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.966
- Okay, cramping up. Switch.
- All right, I'll take a shift.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.634
Hey, this isn't so tough... Yes, it is!

13:49.678 --> 13:52.444
- I'm cramping up already. Switch.
- (sighs) Give me those.

13:52.469 --> 13:54.639
(grunting) Ha-ha!

13:54.675 --> 13:56.408
I did one snip.

13:56.443 --> 13:57.909
Of so many snips.

13:57.944 --> 13:59.511
Admit it, Louise, making a pot holder

13:59.546 --> 14:00.690
sounds pretty good
right now, doesn't it?

14:00.714 --> 14:01.813
No.

14:01.848 --> 14:02.881
This is worth it.

14:02.916 --> 14:04.683
This is totally easy.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.017
Come on, tiny muscles.

14:06.086 --> 14:07.318
Okay, switch.

14:07.354 --> 14:09.587
- Oh, boy.
- What happened, Teddy?

14:09.623 --> 14:11.823
That, uh, screw flew out like a shot.

14:11.858 --> 14:13.058
It could be anywhere.

14:13.093 --> 14:14.592
Oh, God. Sir, don't swallow.

14:14.628 --> 14:15.828
- Spit that out, please.
- Huh?

14:15.862 --> 14:17.429
You might be chewing on a screw.

14:17.464 --> 14:19.230
Uh, y-you're probably
not chewing on a screw,

14:19.266 --> 14:21.099
but-but, yeah, go ahead
and spit it out, hon.

14:21.134 --> 14:23.768
- Uh-huh. -Okay, this magnet says
there's nothing in this bite.

14:23.804 --> 14:25.548
I'm just gonna run it
over your plate real quick.

14:25.572 --> 14:27.939
- Just real quick. You just
enjoy your meal. -Uh, um...

14:27.974 --> 14:29.519
Not touching your food,
not touching your food.

14:29.543 --> 14:31.187
Okay, it made a little
contact right there,

14:31.211 --> 14:32.855
but I'm not gonna do it
again, just a little bit.

14:32.879 --> 14:34.457
- Let me check the fries.
- She's checking the fries.

14:34.481 --> 14:36.614
- Checking the fries.
- Wha-What's happening now?

14:36.650 --> 14:38.290
- I hate...
- It's all under control, Bob.

14:38.318 --> 14:40.018
I was just looking for a missing screw.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.886
If you could just lift
your legs for a second.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.599
Continue to enjoy your meal
while you lift your legs.

14:43.623 --> 14:45.590
Sorry about what's happening. I...

14:45.625 --> 14:47.559
These are very nice
shoes you got, you know?

14:47.594 --> 14:49.928
Do they come in a 13 on the
left and 11 on the right?

14:49.963 --> 14:52.063
You know what? I'm just
gonna go back to the kitchen.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.298
<i>LOUISE: Okay.</i>

14:53.333 --> 14:54.644
I think we're all happy to be past

14:54.668 --> 14:55.900
the sheet metal phase.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.036
- Are we in a union now?
- Guys.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.205
Only a pathetic little
wall stands between us

15:00.240 --> 15:02.729
and all the ceramics we could
ever want to say we made.

15:02.754 --> 15:04.075
Which is wrong.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.922
Our grandparents might never
know we didn't make their gifts,

15:05.946 --> 15:07.912
but we will. A lie is not a gift.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.048
Okay, your conscience
needs to take a breather.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.250
Also your breath needs
to have a conscience.

15:12.285 --> 15:14.419
I'm going to start sawing
through this drywall.

15:14.454 --> 15:15.832
You guys find a way to ditch the dust

15:15.856 --> 15:17.774
without making anyone suspicious.

15:17.799 --> 15:20.266
(sawing)

15:21.956 --> 15:25.006
Man, all this dandruff
is so embarrassing.

15:25.031 --> 15:27.332
What's all this cocaine doing at school?

15:27.367 --> 15:28.967
Throw it away.

15:29.002 --> 15:31.603
Does anybody have any
water for this baby formula?

15:31.638 --> 15:33.104
No? Okay, I'll throw it out.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.572
What's your deal, Tina?

15:34.608 --> 15:36.741
Worry about your own
damn deal, Jimmy Jr.

15:36.777 --> 15:38.309
How are we doing in here?

15:38.345 --> 15:39.511
(grunting)

15:39.546 --> 15:41.946
Yes. Tina, flashlight.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.996
(gasps) The legend. It's real.

15:45.021 --> 15:47.685
I wouldn't say completely worth
the absurd amount of effort.

15:47.721 --> 15:49.287
But, yeah. (whistles)

15:49.322 --> 15:50.455
Okay, back to sawing.

15:50.490 --> 15:51.589
We're so close.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.192
(straining): We are so...

15:54.227 --> 15:55.857
FROND: Busted.

15:55.882 --> 15:57.988
Are those power tools?

15:58.013 --> 16:01.366
Oh, good Lord, you are double busted.

16:01.401 --> 16:04.748
But not triple busted. Phew. (chuckles)

16:05.906 --> 16:07.935
FROND: This is very
unlike you, Belchers.

16:07.971 --> 16:10.443
Simple pranks, lackadaisical
schoolwork, sure.

16:10.468 --> 16:13.035
But demolishing school
property on purpose?

16:13.070 --> 16:15.371
With power tools? Power tools?

16:15.406 --> 16:16.983
We're gonna need those
back, by the way. I mean,

16:17.007 --> 16:18.552
we don't know what you're talking about?

16:18.576 --> 16:19.942
That poor locker.

16:19.977 --> 16:22.444
All right, well, I need
to contact your parents.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.446
In the meantime, you
are to sit and think

16:24.482 --> 16:26.448
about what you've done.

16:26.484 --> 16:27.816
We're gonna get expelled.

16:27.852 --> 16:29.051
How do they do that?

16:29.086 --> 16:30.386
Out of a cannon or something?

16:30.421 --> 16:32.054
Wait, he took our flashlight.

16:32.089 --> 16:34.923
That seems like a weird
punishment. But fair.

16:34.959 --> 16:37.793
Hey, he... wait, he took our saw.
But not the drill?

16:37.827 --> 16:39.638
And why isn't he calling
Mom and Dad in front of us?

16:39.663 --> 16:41.296
He loves doing that.

16:41.332 --> 16:43.332
Oh, my God. Come on.

16:43.690 --> 16:45.090
(gasps) Look.

16:45.115 --> 16:46.948
It's been sawed more.

16:48.205 --> 16:50.072
Mr. Frond?

16:50.107 --> 16:52.474
(hisses) You're supposed
to be in my office.

16:52.510 --> 16:53.642
G-Go away, children.

16:53.677 --> 16:55.256
Where is it? Where is it?

16:55.291 --> 16:57.423
- There it is.
- What are you doing?

16:57.448 --> 16:58.692
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

16:58.716 --> 17:00.429
It's personal. (screams)

17:02.234 --> 17:03.429
Don't touch that!

17:03.898 --> 17:05.686
"Seventh grade secretary."

17:05.723 --> 17:07.256
Dave Titus, check.

17:07.290 --> 17:08.757
Phillip Frond, no check.

17:08.792 --> 17:09.970
Here's another, here's another.

17:09.993 --> 17:11.292
They're all the same.

17:11.328 --> 17:13.628
- (moans)
- What the "H" is going on here?

17:13.664 --> 17:16.365
- Yeah, Frond, talk.
- Fine.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.534
When I was in seventh
grade here at Wagstaff,

17:18.569 --> 17:22.171
I ran for class secretary
against Dave Titus.

17:22.205 --> 17:23.650
- <i>And because I was
popularity-challenged,</i>

17:23.674 --> 17:25.441
- <i>I was expected to lose.</i>
- _

17:25.476 --> 17:27.675
<i>They were counting the
votes in the ceramics room.</i>

17:27.711 --> 17:30.479
<i>The teacher got up to go to the
bathroom right when I happened</i>

17:30.514 --> 17:33.015
<i>to be pacing in the hallway.
I don't know what came over me,</i>

17:33.050 --> 17:34.783
<i>but I grabbed a bunch of votes for Dave,</i>

17:34.819 --> 17:36.118
<i>and stuffed them in a vase.</i>

17:36.153 --> 17:37.686
- (gasps) Whoa.
- You cheated?

17:37.721 --> 17:40.322
I was gonna hide the
vase or-or confess, maybe.

17:40.357 --> 17:42.691
But-but that weekend was the fire.

17:42.726 --> 17:44.359
And they walled the room up.

17:44.395 --> 17:47.187
Then, just like that,
my greatest mistake

17:47.212 --> 17:49.498
and my darkest secret was sealed up.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.834
Welcome to my nightmare.

17:51.869 --> 17:53.469
I beg you, do not tell anyone

17:53.504 --> 17:55.425
about the unthinkable thing I did.

17:55.457 --> 17:58.409
How about we don't get
in any trouble at all,

17:58.434 --> 18:00.909
and in return, we promise
not to tell anyone.

18:00.945 --> 18:02.311
- Deal?
- Fine. Done.

18:02.346 --> 18:05.011
And we each get to take a
couple things off the shelf.

18:05.036 --> 18:07.524
- Whatever.
- It would ruin me if this got out.

18:07.550 --> 18:10.018
I mean, who would listen to a
guidance counselor that did this?

18:10.054 --> 18:11.553
No one, that's who.

18:11.589 --> 18:13.322
Mr. Frond, I-I think
you've been holding

18:13.357 --> 18:14.923
onto this secret when you don't have to.

18:14.959 --> 18:17.874
This may sound crazy, but
kids might listen to you more

18:17.909 --> 18:20.172
if they knew that you made a big mistake
when you were their age.

18:20.197 --> 18:22.679
You know what, Tina? You're right.

18:22.704 --> 18:24.600
That does sound crazy.

18:24.635 --> 18:27.936
Nobody wants a relatable guidance
counselor. Kids think I'm perfect.

18:27.972 --> 18:29.505
That's why they listen to me.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.373
Wait. Why did you break in here?

18:31.408 --> 18:33.656
For the pottery. So we
wouldn't have to make

18:33.681 --> 18:35.344
presents for our grandparents.

18:35.379 --> 18:37.346
- Ugh, really?
- Really.

18:37.381 --> 18:39.248
Then let's just take
our horrible secrets,

18:39.283 --> 18:41.750
push them down deep
inside where they belong,

18:41.785 --> 18:43.585
and go our separate ways, shall we?

18:43.621 --> 18:45.521
Sounds great. Ooh.

18:45.556 --> 18:47.723
That one has a certain
Gene Ne sais quoi.

18:48.313 --> 18:52.069
No. Damn it. Tina's right.

18:52.094 --> 18:53.896
No, I think we covered this.

18:53.931 --> 18:55.430
- Tina's wrong.
- (sighs)

18:55.466 --> 18:57.633
I don't want this kind
of regret, you know?

18:57.668 --> 18:59.101
I don't want to turn out like him.

18:59.136 --> 19:00.769
- No, you don't.
- You know?

19:00.804 --> 19:02.404
- Like, look at you.
- Yeah.

19:02.439 --> 19:05.407
Ugh. I don't want to
play these off as my own.

19:05.442 --> 19:08.777
Not to my grandparents who
might semi-treasure them.

19:08.812 --> 19:11.146
A lie is a crappy gift.

19:11.181 --> 19:12.648
That's great, Louise. See, Mr. Frond?

19:12.683 --> 19:14.383
Louise learned from your mistake,

19:14.418 --> 19:16.885
so she wouldn't have to
make that mistake herself.

19:16.921 --> 19:18.253
What are you even talking about?

19:18.289 --> 19:19.721
Where do you get this stuff from?

19:19.757 --> 19:21.123
So what are we gonna do now?

19:21.158 --> 19:22.624
Learn origami real quick?

19:22.660 --> 19:24.259
I might have an idea.

19:24.295 --> 19:26.662
ROSE: (sniffs) It
smells like smoky mold,

19:26.697 --> 19:28.163
but it kind of works.

19:28.198 --> 19:30.599
You're making me so hungry for cheese.

19:30.634 --> 19:31.967
What do you think of my pinch pot?

19:32.002 --> 19:34.336
It's, um, well, you made it.

19:34.371 --> 19:36.138
I'm loving my mug. Uh...

19:36.173 --> 19:37.906
I'm loving my short vase.

19:37.942 --> 19:41.143
- (Teddy scatting)
- (sighs) Teddy, listen.

19:41.178 --> 19:43.278
I-I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but...

19:43.314 --> 19:45.347
- Bob, we got to talk.
- Okay.

19:45.382 --> 19:47.950
It's just not working out,
you know? It's... it's you.

19:47.985 --> 19:50.352
- Because you're a good
guy, you know? - Uh-huh.

19:50.387 --> 19:53.088
You're just... you're tough
to share a workspace with.

19:53.123 --> 19:54.968
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I get it. No, no. I...

19:54.992 --> 19:55.958
- Yeah, we're both perfectionists.
- Yeah.

19:55.993 --> 19:57.326
Me more than you, but yes.

19:57.361 --> 19:58.505
Everything you're saying makes sense.

19:58.529 --> 19:59.494
Not to mention you're always talking.

19:59.530 --> 20:00.540
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm trying to work,

20:00.564 --> 20:01.608
- and you're talking.
- Right.

20:01.632 --> 20:02.598
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:02.633 --> 20:04.266
All-all-all
good points.

20:04.301 --> 20:06.835
So I'm just gonna do this
phone stuff from home.

20:06.870 --> 20:09.304
Unless you want to leave.
Work at a different restaurant?

20:09.340 --> 20:11.707
No, I'll-I'll probably
stick here with this one.

20:11.742 --> 20:14.054
- Yeah, your stuff's already here
anyway, right? -Right, right.

20:14.078 --> 20:15.944
- Eh...
- Seems more reasonable.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.346
Okay, Ma, got to go.

20:17.381 --> 20:18.547
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

20:18.582 --> 20:20.382
Good luck with your glaucoma exam.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.618
Don't cheat. (laughs) Oh, you hung up.

20:22.653 --> 20:25.354
The grandparents loved
your handmade presents.

20:25.389 --> 20:27.189
- Nice job, kids.
- Hey, Mom,

20:27.224 --> 20:29.324
how come you're not wearing
the necklace we made you?

20:29.360 --> 20:31.159
- Oh, am I not wearing it?
- Nope.

20:31.195 --> 20:32.394
It's hard to tell if it's on.

20:32.429 --> 20:34.534
- Put it on, woman.
- Okay.

20:34.559 --> 20:36.308
All right. (grunting)

20:36.333 --> 20:38.545
- TINA: Little heavy?
- Maybe a little. It's just a little...

20:38.569 --> 20:40.202
Hey, Dad, where's the gift we made you?

20:40.237 --> 20:42.404
You mean this wet clump of clay?

20:42.439 --> 20:45.340
We didn't know what you wanted.
Dads are so hard to shop for.

20:45.376 --> 20:47.843
Think of it as the gift
card of handmade gifts.

20:47.878 --> 20:50.145
- Thanks?
- Aw, don't mention it.
