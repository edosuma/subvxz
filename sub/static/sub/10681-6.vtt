00:07.350 --> 00:09.116
If you were dating Wonder Woman

00:09.118 --> 00:11.852
and you had to break up with
her, how would you do it?

00:11.854 --> 00:13.519
Probably the most cowardly way possible,

00:13.521 --> 00:15.421
'cause she could snap
my neck in a heartbeat.

00:15.423 --> 00:17.590
Who has she dated in the
past? Like, has she dated?

00:17.592 --> 00:18.891
Steve Trevor?

00:18.893 --> 00:20.259
And who broke it off... Steve Trevor?

00:20.261 --> 00:21.294
- Yeah.
- How'd he do it?

00:21.296 --> 00:23.262
He faked his death.

00:25.553 --> 00:27.887
I think if it came to it, I
just wouldn't even fake it.

00:29.390 --> 00:32.958
I would just take the coward's way out.

00:32.960 --> 00:33.992
Well, how would you?

00:33.994 --> 00:35.227
I'd write her a letter.

00:35.229 --> 00:36.394
You know, who writes letters these days?

00:36.396 --> 00:37.996
A "Dear John" letter?

00:37.998 --> 00:39.631
I'd just... I'd be scared
to do it face-to-face.

00:39.633 --> 00:41.299
I'd definitely want
to be a fly on the wall

00:41.301 --> 00:42.734
as she read that letter.

00:42.736 --> 00:45.170
Like, "You've got to be kidding me.

00:45.172 --> 00:47.371
You've got to be kidding me."

00:47.373 --> 00:49.073
I've literally yet to meet the female

00:49.075 --> 00:51.308
that he's too good for.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.377
Like, suddenly it's Wonder Woman?

01:25.273 --> 01:27.261

01:29.346 --> 01:31.046
Hello, and welcome to another episode

01:31.048 --> 01:32.747
of "Comic Book Men," the only show

01:32.749 --> 01:35.083
that's fighting for your
rights in our satin tights.

01:35.085 --> 01:36.685
- I'm Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:36.687 --> 01:38.085
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

01:38.087 --> 01:39.086
Ming Chen.

01:39.088 --> 01:40.688
Okay, man, what went on

01:40.690 --> 01:43.024
in Jay and Silent Bob's
Secret Stash this week?

01:43.026 --> 01:45.293
We had a dear friend come by the Stash,

01:45.295 --> 01:47.128
and he was able to spend
the whole day with us.

01:54.970 --> 01:56.636
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.571
I was looking to get, uh,
"Fantastic Four" number 40

01:58.573 --> 01:59.973
up there.

01:59.975 --> 02:01.741
Give the man a "Fantastic
Four" number 40,

02:01.743 --> 02:02.976
if that's what you're here for.

02:02.978 --> 02:04.110
- You heard 'em.
- Ye... yes, sir.

02:04.112 --> 02:05.145
- Snap, snap.
- Yes, sir.

02:05.147 --> 02:07.814
What?

02:07.816 --> 02:09.816
We were lucky enough
for him to be in town,

02:09.818 --> 02:12.251
and he was able to spend
the whole day at the Stash.

02:12.253 --> 02:14.220
Could you imagine walking
into a comic book store

02:14.222 --> 02:16.755
and seeing Stan Lee on the
other side of the counter?

02:16.757 --> 02:18.457
I would immediately leave.

02:18.459 --> 02:20.326
I'm like, "This place is
gonna be way overpriced."

02:20.328 --> 02:22.594
It's crazy.

02:22.596 --> 02:25.597
I mean, it's a reminder of
just how great a job we have.

02:25.599 --> 02:28.300
Sellin' comics and hanging
out with Stan Lee...

02:28.302 --> 02:30.601
I mean, it's almost like it's a dream.

02:30.603 --> 02:32.270
I don't know if you know,
but this guy right here...

02:32.272 --> 02:33.671
He wrote this.

02:33.673 --> 02:35.273
I-I'm well aware of that, yeah.

02:35.275 --> 02:36.574
Okay, well, yeah...

02:36.576 --> 02:37.942
Okay, just wanted to make sure.

02:37.944 --> 02:39.577
I just came here to get a comic book,

02:39.579 --> 02:41.112
and Stan Lee's sitting
here. I don't know...

02:41.114 --> 02:42.981
I want to make sure
they get a fair price

02:42.983 --> 02:45.616
for these stories that I wrote.

02:52.591 --> 02:54.925
- "Fantastic Four" number 40.
- Oh, yeah.

02:54.927 --> 02:56.960
Second part of "A Blind
Man Shall Lead Them."

02:56.962 --> 02:59.162
God, I love the Fantastic Four.

02:59.164 --> 03:01.664
That's all you're charging for it?

03:01.666 --> 03:03.199
It's... it's not a
high-grade copy, Stan.

03:03.201 --> 03:04.800
It's got some issues with the spine.

03:04.802 --> 03:07.003
It could be all wrinkled and torn,

03:07.005 --> 03:09.205
but it's my story!

03:09.207 --> 03:12.708
All right, all right, you
don't care how you hurt a man.

03:12.710 --> 03:14.977
What a bargain you'll be getting.

03:14.979 --> 03:17.213
I was actually looking
to get it for about $30.

03:17.215 --> 03:19.648
Get that man out of
the... out of the store!

03:19.650 --> 03:21.649
Oh, sorry. Sorry, sir,
you're out of here.

03:21.651 --> 03:22.850
No, really?

03:22.852 --> 03:24.452
Who has the gall to be like,

03:24.454 --> 03:26.687
"Hey, you... I know
it's your classic work,

03:26.689 --> 03:28.223
but I'd still like to
get a little bit off"?

03:29.626 --> 03:31.059
There are people who
pay to meet the guy.

03:31.061 --> 03:32.693
Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:32.695 --> 03:34.129
And he's like, "Not
only am I meeting you,

03:34.131 --> 03:35.696
but I want a discount."

03:37.499 --> 03:40.034
It's... it's unreal.
It's... They're shameless.

03:40.036 --> 03:41.501
They're shameless, Stan.

03:41.503 --> 03:44.338
How about if I tell you
something about Dr. Doom

03:44.340 --> 03:46.240
that you had never thought of before?

03:46.242 --> 03:47.975
Okay.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.544
Would that make the price a
little bit more bearable to you?

03:50.546 --> 03:52.913
- I think so.
- Okay.

03:52.915 --> 03:55.381
- Dr. Doom, to me...
- Mm-hmm.

03:55.383 --> 03:58.318
- Is not really a criminal.
- Oh.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.686
What does he really want?

04:00.688 --> 04:03.156
He wants to take over the world, right?

04:03.158 --> 04:06.259
Okay, let's say you want
to take over the world

04:06.261 --> 04:08.161
- just like Dr. Doom.
- Okay.

04:08.163 --> 04:09.528
And you're walking down the street,

04:09.530 --> 04:13.265
and you see a policeman or an FBI agent,

04:13.267 --> 04:14.866
and you walk over to 'em, you say,

04:14.868 --> 04:18.269
"Excuse me. I want to
take over the world."

04:18.272 --> 04:20.238
They can't arrest you.

04:20.240 --> 04:24.709
It is not a crime to want
to take over the world.

04:24.711 --> 04:27.512
So why do they consider him a villain?

04:27.514 --> 04:31.782
All he wants to do is
take over the world.

04:31.784 --> 04:33.184
It was enlightening.

04:33.186 --> 04:35.752
I had never, ever thought of Dr. Doom

04:35.754 --> 04:38.255
in the way that, you know, Stan
presented it that afternoon.

04:38.257 --> 04:40.091
I don't think anyone else has either.

04:42.095 --> 04:43.894
I think, considering the fact

04:43.896 --> 04:47.230
that you're one of the
few people now who knows

04:47.232 --> 04:50.733
that Dr. Doom can't be
classified as a criminal,

04:50.735 --> 04:55.705
that knowledge should make that
price a little bit more, um...

04:55.707 --> 04:56.706
- Palatable.
- Tenable.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.574
So what do you think?

04:58.576 --> 05:00.076
You're lucky I don't off
you after you heard that.

05:00.078 --> 05:01.811
I know.

05:01.813 --> 05:03.479
- I'll pay $39.95 for that.
- All right. Here you go.

05:03.481 --> 05:06.715
All right. Hey, you're
getting a bargain.

05:06.717 --> 05:09.485
So he's helping you out of
a jam, this Stan Lee, man.

05:09.487 --> 05:11.586
- He's like a buddy.
- He's more than a buddy.

05:11.588 --> 05:13.588
He... We should've
gave him a staff shirt.

05:15.092 --> 05:16.892
Stan's gonna take you
out of the Negative Zone

05:16.894 --> 05:18.660
into the Positive Zone.

05:18.662 --> 05:21.329
Cash-positive.

05:21.331 --> 05:22.930
- Enjoy the book.
- Take care, guys. Thanks a lot.

05:22.932 --> 05:24.765
We'll settle up at the end of the day.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.934
Okay.

05:26.936 --> 05:29.770
Wow. That's an amazing
way of looking at things.

05:29.772 --> 05:31.572
- You have to.
- I never would've thought that.

05:31.574 --> 05:34.242
It's all he wants to do.
He wants to rule the world.

05:34.244 --> 05:36.643
I'd like to. You'd like
to. You'd probably like to.

05:36.645 --> 05:38.311
You don't give a damn.

05:38.313 --> 05:39.779
- No, he doesn't.
- He's got my number.

05:42.851 --> 05:45.752
Hey, Stan, what was behind
the "Playgirl" pose you did

05:45.754 --> 05:47.020
back in the '70s?

05:47.022 --> 05:49.322
I thought people had
forgotten about that.

05:49.324 --> 05:50.757
Not us!

05:50.759 --> 05:53.259
"Avengers" 4, reprint
and original record.

05:53.261 --> 05:54.927
I instantly recognized what it was.

05:54.929 --> 05:57.463
How could you not
recognize Captain Ame...

05:57.465 --> 05:59.731
Don't make it sound like
you did something clever.

06:07.388 --> 06:10.589
If you could write any
character not in comics,

06:10.591 --> 06:13.791
in literature and movies,
who would you pick?

06:13.793 --> 06:16.595
There are two that I'm very fond of.

06:16.597 --> 06:18.597
- One is Sherlock Holmes...
- Oh, okay.

06:18.599 --> 06:20.632
'Cause he also was very smart.

06:20.634 --> 06:23.602
The other one was... you
may not know him as well...

06:23.604 --> 06:25.162
- But the Scarlet Pimpernel.
- Oh, yeah.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.737
And to me, that movie,
with Leslie Howard,

06:27.737 --> 06:31.404
where he played an effete
fop, an English guy,

06:31.406 --> 06:33.540
but he was really the Pimpernel...

06:33.542 --> 06:36.910
He was like one of the first
great superheroes, you know?

06:36.912 --> 06:39.146
But I was the only guy who realized it.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.781
Nobody else had any idea.

06:40.783 --> 06:43.149
Is that where they got that
name, "pimp"? Pimpernel?

06:43.151 --> 06:45.051
You know, if he's gonna react like that,

06:45.053 --> 06:46.753
I-I'm gonna just talk to you, Walt.

06:46.755 --> 06:48.220
- Hey, you know what?
- I mean...

06:48.222 --> 06:49.588
- That's fine.
- That makes our day.

06:49.590 --> 06:51.924
I'm of a more serious bent.

06:51.926 --> 06:54.627
You frivolous youngsters,
I can't go along.

06:56.464 --> 06:58.931
It's almost like it's 1995 again, man.

06:58.933 --> 07:02.067
That's when I first met Stan
Lee on the set of "Mallrats,"

07:02.069 --> 07:04.169
and that's where you
guys met him as well.

07:04.171 --> 07:06.471
And he was just as sweet
then as he is today, man.

07:06.473 --> 07:08.573
The energy, the humor...

07:08.575 --> 07:11.342
I mean, he is an
absolute joy to be around,

07:11.344 --> 07:13.344
and, of course, we got to
ask him all the questions

07:13.346 --> 07:14.980
we've always wanted to ask.

07:14.982 --> 07:16.914
Hey, Stan, I always wanted to know,

07:16.916 --> 07:19.650
what was behind the "Playgirl"
pose you did back in the '70s?

07:19.652 --> 07:22.153
Oh, jeez.

07:22.155 --> 07:24.655
I thought people had
forgotten about that.

07:24.657 --> 07:26.456
- You mean...
- Not us!

07:26.458 --> 07:27.958
My Burt Reynolds pose?

07:27.960 --> 07:29.359
Yeah, yeah, the Burt Reynolds pose.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.595
Well, what happened was Burt had done

07:31.597 --> 07:34.964
a photograph of himself
in "Cosmopolitan" magazine.

07:36.601 --> 07:39.302
And that got a lot of attention

07:39.304 --> 07:41.504
'cause he was a big star at the time,

07:41.506 --> 07:44.440
and some idiot at
Marvel came over to me...

07:44.442 --> 07:47.376
"Hey, Stan, why don't you
do a Burt Reynolds pose?"

07:49.715 --> 07:52.314
Everybody else at Marvel
said, "Yeah, what a great idea!

07:52.316 --> 07:53.816
What a great idea!"

07:53.818 --> 07:56.819
So I lay down on something
and took off my clothes,

07:56.821 --> 07:58.220
except for my shorts...

07:58.222 --> 08:01.056
But I covered the
shorts up with a comic.

08:04.061 --> 08:08.629
I was hoping people would say,
"What a great build he has!"

08:08.631 --> 08:11.032
But they just said, "What
would make that dummy

08:11.034 --> 08:13.167
do a photo like this!"

08:14.704 --> 08:16.037
At a certain point,

08:16.039 --> 08:18.239
you know, Stan, uh,
wanted to go grab a bite,

08:18.241 --> 08:20.208
and while he did, we had
a reservist come in...

08:20.210 --> 08:22.844
A guy who comes in weekly
and buys his comics.

08:22.846 --> 08:25.045
We kind of put 'em on the side for him.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.880
- Hey, Andrew, what's up?
- How are ya?

08:26.882 --> 08:29.415
- Got your comics ready to go.
- Thank you.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.417
I got some bad news.

08:31.419 --> 08:32.719
What's wrong?

08:32.721 --> 08:34.354
This is the end of my pull list.

08:34.356 --> 08:36.222
- I'm done collecting comics.
- What?

08:36.225 --> 08:37.724
It's just one of those things, you know.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.392
I'm a middle-aged man.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.427
I never thought I would
outgrow comics, but I have.

08:41.429 --> 08:42.660
I just...

08:42.663 --> 08:44.163
Maybe you have major depression.

08:44.164 --> 08:45.998
Go take some medicine, come back.

08:47.501 --> 08:49.568
- Cuttin' the comic cord?
- Yes.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.103
Really?

08:51.105 --> 08:52.872
It's sad to see somebody
lose their passion,

08:52.874 --> 08:55.241
and for a business, it's
sad to see a reservist go,

08:55.243 --> 08:56.876
but it's not financial

08:56.878 --> 08:59.244
as much as, like, just
watchin' somebody you knew

08:59.246 --> 09:01.712
was down with the cause go away.

09:01.714 --> 09:03.614
That's why I broke the
glass on the cyanide capsule.

09:03.616 --> 09:06.517
Crunch!

09:06.519 --> 09:08.953
You were a great customer,
Andrew, and, you know...

09:08.955 --> 09:10.388
Stop in whenever you want, though.

09:10.390 --> 09:11.722
- Thank you.
- All right?

09:11.724 --> 09:13.691
Sorry to lose you.

09:13.693 --> 09:16.026
- Painful, look away.
- Whew.

09:20.465 --> 09:21.899
I just can't believe it.

09:21.901 --> 09:24.734
I mean, he's been
coming here for 15 years,

09:24.736 --> 09:26.870
every Wednesday, like clockwork.

09:26.872 --> 09:28.305
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Stan.

09:28.307 --> 09:29.739
Hi.

09:29.741 --> 09:32.276
You all look kind of
downcast. What's wrong?

09:32.278 --> 09:33.976
Uh, we had a customer

09:33.978 --> 09:36.078
who's been coming here for 15 years.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.948
He just told us that, um, he's
lost his passion for comics

09:38.950 --> 09:40.482
- and...
- Oh, for gosh sakes.

09:40.484 --> 09:42.084
He's not coming back anymore.

09:42.086 --> 09:44.620
You've lost a true
believer, you might say.

09:44.622 --> 09:46.722
See, the thing is, guys,

09:46.724 --> 09:48.991
I've run into this before.

09:48.993 --> 09:51.492
There are ways to bring
them back, I think.

09:51.494 --> 09:53.428
I-in fact, is the
fellow around here now?

09:53.430 --> 09:54.729
Can you get him?

09:54.731 --> 09:56.731
It'd be kind of nice to talk to him.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.333
- We can call him.
- Why don't you do that?

09:58.335 --> 10:01.102
You don't win 'em all,
but I think if we make

10:01.104 --> 10:02.938
a good, solid try,

10:02.940 --> 10:06.441
we might be able to bring
him back into the fold.

10:06.443 --> 10:08.309
It's almost like an exorcism.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.512
But we're gonna do what we can, damn it.

10:12.514 --> 10:16.951
Obviously, you want as much as
you can tear out of these guys.

10:16.953 --> 10:19.987
Already, he's looking to see,
"Is there a tear somewhere?"

10:19.989 --> 10:22.156
- Yeah, yep.
- "Is there a soup stain on it?"

10:22.158 --> 10:24.357
Andrew, I'd like you to meet somebody.

10:24.359 --> 10:26.025
I've heard a lot about
you. I'm Stan Lee.

10:26.027 --> 10:28.027
Good to meet you, Stan.

10:30.321 --> 10:33.394
Stan, tell 'em the story about
how you almost quit comics.

10:33.542 --> 10:36.208
Well, it was just before
"The Fantastic Four."

10:36.210 --> 10:38.110
I had been writing the kind of stories

10:38.112 --> 10:40.112
my publisher wanted me to write,

10:40.114 --> 10:42.648
and he said, "Don't
worry about dialogue,

10:42.650 --> 10:44.383
"characterization, or any of that.

10:44.385 --> 10:46.118
"Give me action!

10:46.120 --> 10:48.253
I want fight scenes on every page!"

10:48.255 --> 10:51.223
I said, "But how about we
tell some stories also?"

10:51.225 --> 10:54.091
"Of course you have a story, but
it's the action that they want."

10:54.093 --> 10:55.893
After a couple of years
of that, I went home,

10:55.895 --> 10:58.763
and I said to my wife,
"Joanie, I'm gonna quit.

10:58.765 --> 11:01.633
This isn't writing.
Anybody could do this."

11:01.635 --> 11:05.337
And she said, "Stan,
if you want to quit,

11:05.339 --> 11:08.773
"why don't you do one book
the way you want to do it?

11:08.775 --> 11:11.342
"He'll probably fire you for it,

11:11.344 --> 11:13.143
"but what do you care if you're fired?

11:13.145 --> 11:14.945
You want to quit anyway."

11:14.947 --> 11:17.348
So that sounded like sage advice.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.583
And I did "The Fantastic Four,"

11:19.585 --> 11:22.285
and, luckily, it sold,

11:22.287 --> 11:24.154
and the rest is history.

11:24.156 --> 11:25.589
What do you say to the end of that,

11:25.591 --> 11:27.289
except "Excelsior"?

11:27.291 --> 11:29.925
Excelsior.

11:40.521 --> 11:42.722
Hey, what about when...
When Marvel decided

11:42.724 --> 11:44.724
- to kill Gwen Stacy?
- Oh!

11:44.726 --> 11:46.892
I-I heard that they
didn't even let you know.

11:46.894 --> 11:49.528
Well, we gave the
writers a lot of freedom.

11:49.530 --> 11:52.798
So I had to go to Europe
on a business trip,

11:52.800 --> 11:55.534
and I said, um, to...

11:55.536 --> 11:57.602
I... You know, I forgot
the name of the writer.

11:57.604 --> 11:59.904
- Gerry Conway?
- Gerry Conway!

11:59.906 --> 12:02.306
See, the reason I've
tried to forget his name

12:02.308 --> 12:04.475
is I hate him...

12:04.477 --> 12:07.478
Because while... While I was in Europe,

12:07.480 --> 12:09.748
he killed Gwen Stacy.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.018
I didn't want to kill her.

12:11.125 --> 12:14.292
But what bothered me the
most, a few issues earlier,

12:14.294 --> 12:16.627
I had killed Gwen Stacy's father.

12:16.629 --> 12:19.397
- Captain Stacy.
- Yeah, Captain Stacy.

12:19.399 --> 12:23.902
And it looked like we had some
sort of a hatred for the Stacys.

12:23.904 --> 12:26.170
Like we were out to destroy them,

12:26.172 --> 12:27.906
which, of course, was not the case.

12:27.908 --> 12:29.339
Uh, if... so, if Gwen had lived...

12:29.341 --> 12:30.840
Oh, oh, oh.

12:30.842 --> 12:32.642
- And it was up to you...
- If only she had.

12:32.644 --> 12:34.878
Who would Peter Parker
have chose to marry?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.413
Would it have been Gwen or Mary Jane?

12:36.415 --> 12:38.415
You know, honest to gosh, I don't know.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.717
I thought I'd let the
series keep going on,

12:40.719 --> 12:42.652
and sooner or later,
it would come to me.

12:42.654 --> 12:43.887
- Oh.
- It never did.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.389
Like the Betty and Veronica thing.

12:45.391 --> 12:47.189
How can you mention "Archie"

12:47.191 --> 12:48.557
in the same breath...

12:48.559 --> 12:51.193
- I'm sorry.
- I'll slap him.

12:51.195 --> 12:52.694
Oh, uh, wait a minute.

12:52.696 --> 12:55.031
Obviously this is somebody
who wants to buy or sell,

12:55.033 --> 12:57.199
and that's more important
than anything we have to say.

12:57.201 --> 12:58.600
- Yes, sir.
- It's a customer.

12:58.602 --> 13:00.669
- I am a customer.
- In capital letters...

13:00.671 --> 13:02.405
A CUSTOMER!

13:02.407 --> 13:04.539
I have something that you
would probably know about, Stan.

13:04.541 --> 13:07.775
It's the Golden Records
"Avengers" 4 reprint

13:07.777 --> 13:08.876
and original record.

13:08.878 --> 13:10.445
Oh, man.

13:16.553 --> 13:18.719
This record really was good.

13:18.721 --> 13:20.620
It's a talking record of this story.

13:20.622 --> 13:22.356
Yeah, originally they came together

13:22.358 --> 13:24.425
so the kids could listen to the record

13:24.427 --> 13:26.427
and then flip along with the comic.

13:26.429 --> 13:29.863
How it could've been so good
without me having a role in it,

13:29.865 --> 13:32.232
I'll never know.

13:32.234 --> 13:34.634
Now, you want to sell
these, so obviously you want

13:34.636 --> 13:38.071
as much as you can
tear out of these guys.

13:38.073 --> 13:40.873
- And you want to hold him down.
- Ehh...

13:42.243 --> 13:43.809
You're... Already, he's looking to see,

13:43.811 --> 13:45.611
"Is there a tear somewhere?"

13:45.613 --> 13:47.246
- Yeah.
- "Is there a soup stain on it?"

13:47.248 --> 13:49.148
All right, I'll let
you talk for a minute

13:49.150 --> 13:50.883
before I arbitrate this matter.

13:50.885 --> 13:53.886
All right, all right,
um, where'd you get it?

13:53.888 --> 13:56.621
I actually got it at a antique market,

13:56.623 --> 13:59.891
and I instantly recognized
what it was, and, uh...

13:59.893 --> 14:02.094
How could you not
recognize Captain Ame...

14:02.096 --> 14:04.929
Don't make it sound like
you did something clever.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.798
Anybody could recognize Captain...

14:06.800 --> 14:08.600
I did the research, and I knew it.

14:08.602 --> 14:10.668
No, I shouldn't... You don't
talk to customers that way.

14:10.670 --> 14:12.636
Forgive... That was really clever

14:12.638 --> 14:16.107
- of you to recognize that, right?
- Thank you. Oh, thank you.

14:16.109 --> 14:17.808
It's rare.

14:17.810 --> 14:20.444
I-I haven't seen one of these
ever come through the store.

14:20.446 --> 14:24.181
It was a reprint of the
first time Captain America

14:24.183 --> 14:26.517
comes back into the Marvel Universe,

14:26.519 --> 14:29.752
and we got a lot of insight
into what Stan was thinking.

14:29.754 --> 14:30.987
Captain America had been

14:30.989 --> 14:33.089
one of my favorites when I was young,

14:33.091 --> 14:35.492
but then they stopped publishing it,

14:35.494 --> 14:38.961
and when I became the
editor, I said to myself,

14:38.963 --> 14:40.930
"Why don't you bring back this guy

14:40.932 --> 14:42.932
that you yourself liked so much?"

14:42.934 --> 14:44.700
So, in order to bring him back,

14:44.702 --> 14:47.136
we claimed that he had
fallen off an airplane

14:47.138 --> 14:48.504
during the war or something,

14:48.506 --> 14:51.206
and he landed in a glacier
and was frozen over.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.807
And he was finally discovered.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.543
They thawed him out, and there he was...

14:54.545 --> 14:58.280
Captain America... but
it was 20 years later.

14:58.282 --> 15:00.315
I mean, suddenly he had woken up

15:00.317 --> 15:02.716
at a time when we had hippies...

15:02.718 --> 15:05.286
And we had protest marches...

15:05.288 --> 15:07.621
and we had rock music and
all that kind of stuff,

15:07.623 --> 15:10.324
and he felt he was a man out of time.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.725
And it worked.

15:11.727 --> 15:13.561
Right now he's one of
the most popular guys

15:13.563 --> 15:14.895
in "The Avengers."

15:14.897 --> 15:17.198
Even though I didn't create him myself,

15:17.200 --> 15:19.232
and I hate to say that...

15:19.234 --> 15:21.368
He's a great character, and I like him.

15:21.370 --> 15:24.304
Having Stan in the store
and having him talk...

15:24.306 --> 15:27.174
Would it be like having, like,
Shakespeare come into the store?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.642
Absolutely, or I would
put it right up there

15:29.644 --> 15:31.744
with, like, the framers
of the Constitution

15:31.746 --> 15:33.180
and the Declaration of Independence.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.714
Some people'd be like,

15:34.716 --> 15:36.348
"You're ridiculous.
It birthed a nation."

15:36.350 --> 15:37.749
He birthed more than a nation.

15:37.751 --> 15:40.719
He birthed a universe...
Marvel Universe.

15:42.390 --> 15:44.490
All right, so what are
you looking to get for it?

15:44.492 --> 15:48.060
- I'd like to get $450.
- $450, huh?

15:48.062 --> 15:51.363
The sleeve has definitely
seen better days.

15:51.365 --> 15:54.932
The comic has got some soft edges.

15:54.934 --> 15:56.767
How about $300?

15:56.769 --> 16:00.938
How about, uh... How about $400?

16:00.940 --> 16:02.240
Hmm.

16:02.242 --> 16:03.908
I think I could do $325.

16:03.910 --> 16:06.444
I can do it for $350.

16:06.446 --> 16:08.379
All right, I can do it for $350.

16:08.381 --> 16:09.680
- Okay.
- Deal.

16:11.049 --> 16:13.550
- There you go, my friend.
- Fantastic.

16:13.552 --> 16:15.018
- Take it easy.
- Take care.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.553
Huh?

16:16.555 --> 16:18.455
Wow. I'm never gonna
try to sell you anything.

16:21.393 --> 16:25.562
Andrew, how could you ever
think of giving up comics?

16:25.564 --> 16:26.930
Shh.

16:37.419 --> 16:40.653
You know, I wrote "The Fantastic Four,"

16:40.656 --> 16:43.023
"The X-Men,"
"Spider-Man," "The Hulk,"

16:43.025 --> 16:47.260
just about all of the superhero
stories in the beginning,

16:47.262 --> 16:49.462
on one little typewriter I had.

16:49.464 --> 16:52.465
My wife has something of a temper,

16:52.467 --> 16:55.335
and we were having an argument one day,

16:55.337 --> 16:58.037
and she said, "Oh, yeah? I'll show you!"

16:58.039 --> 17:01.274
And she lifted up that
little, innocent typewriter

17:01.276 --> 17:03.541
- and smashed it.
- Whoa.

17:03.543 --> 17:07.378
I said, "Honey, do you know
what we could probably auction

17:07.381 --> 17:10.515
the typewriter on which all
these stories were written?"

17:10.517 --> 17:13.484
Oh, she couldn't apologize enough,

17:13.487 --> 17:15.053
but then a friend of mine said,

17:15.055 --> 17:17.455
"Why don't you go to an antique shop,

17:17.458 --> 17:21.492
buy a similar typewriter,
and put it on auction?"

17:21.493 --> 17:25.061
And I had to reply,
"Because I'm an idiot.

17:25.064 --> 17:27.164
"I've told the story"...

17:27.165 --> 17:30.667
"Of my wife breaking it all over town!"

17:31.670 --> 17:33.070
- Uh-oh.
- Oh.

17:33.072 --> 17:34.405
- Andrew.
- Hey, guys.

17:34.407 --> 17:35.739
I'd like you to meet somebody.

17:35.741 --> 17:37.740
Andrew, I've heard a lot about you.

17:37.742 --> 17:39.309
- I'm Stan Lee.
- Good to meet you, Stan.

17:39.311 --> 17:40.576
Pleasure.

17:40.578 --> 17:42.512
I was hoping to meet
you, because I heard

17:42.514 --> 17:44.514
that you've sort of given up on comics,

17:44.516 --> 17:45.882
- on collecting comics.
- Yeah.

17:45.884 --> 17:47.650
Well, there are certain things

17:47.652 --> 17:49.519
it's hard to lose your passion for.

17:49.521 --> 17:51.521
There's women, and there's movies,

17:51.523 --> 17:53.523
and there's comic books for me.

17:55.592 --> 17:57.726
Come on, man, you got Stan
Lee standing next to you.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.228
I mean, it's one thing

17:59.230 --> 18:01.230
if you're like, "Come
on, Andrew, stay with us."

18:01.232 --> 18:03.032
But then you've got the
granddaddy of 'em all

18:03.034 --> 18:05.401
standing behind you, going,
"Stay with us, Spider-friend."

18:07.571 --> 18:09.604
See, the thing about a comic book...

18:09.606 --> 18:12.840
And maybe you've been
reading them so much

18:12.842 --> 18:15.709
that sometimes you can't
see the forest for the trees.

18:15.711 --> 18:18.346
It's literature. It's artwork.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.614
It's food for the imagination.

18:20.616 --> 18:23.584
Everything about them is inspirational.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.319
You know, it's not the books.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.388
They've been a friend of
mine since I was a kid.

18:27.390 --> 18:29.989
I think they're as well-written
as they've ever been.

18:29.991 --> 18:32.792
But at this point, I've
just lost my interest

18:32.794 --> 18:34.294
in comic books.

18:34.296 --> 18:35.595
Hey, it's nothing to me

18:35.597 --> 18:37.597
if you never read another comic,

18:37.599 --> 18:40.833
but you once had a
great feeling for them,

18:40.835 --> 18:44.971
and I just wanted to
give you a second chance

18:44.973 --> 18:47.406
to think about what you're giving up.

18:47.408 --> 18:50.609
It's more than just some
books. It's... it's...

18:50.611 --> 18:53.479
You're giving up a whole way of life.

18:53.481 --> 18:55.914
I just wanted a chance to tell you that.

18:55.916 --> 18:59.485
You know what my first
book I ever bought was?

18:59.487 --> 19:01.120
What was that?

19:01.122 --> 19:03.621
- "Amazing Spider-Man" 124.
- You're kidding.

19:03.623 --> 19:08.426
1973, 15 cents, right off the rack.

19:08.428 --> 19:09.860
And you remember that.

19:09.862 --> 19:13.465
How can you ever think
of giving up comics

19:13.467 --> 19:15.200
when they obviously mean much to you?

19:15.202 --> 19:16.968
Or you wouldn't even remember that.

19:16.970 --> 19:19.636
I was collecting when it was uncool.

19:19.638 --> 19:22.539
Now it's kind of cool to
be a comic collector and...

19:22.541 --> 19:24.007
You're still not cool. Don't worry.

19:24.009 --> 19:25.342
I was writing them

19:25.344 --> 19:26.810
when they were uncool.

19:26.812 --> 19:29.646
What was the first comic
that you ever wrote?

19:29.648 --> 19:31.848
I think it was a "Captain America,"

19:31.850 --> 19:34.851
and then I was told to
make up a few new ones,

19:34.853 --> 19:37.220
- and I made up the Sub-Mariner.
- Shh.

19:37.222 --> 19:39.388
You had me at "Captain America."

19:39.390 --> 19:43.659
Oh!

19:43.661 --> 19:45.894
I'm back.

19:45.896 --> 19:47.463
Mission accomplished.

19:47.465 --> 19:49.031
- Mm, yeah.
- Huh?

19:49.033 --> 19:50.799
Did you ever doubt it?

19:50.801 --> 19:53.368
Now it just means that anytime
a reservist tries to leave,

19:53.370 --> 19:54.869
got to get Stan Lee in the store.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.373
So you'll be back next week?

19:58.375 --> 20:00.074
I'll be here next week, Walter.

20:00.076 --> 20:02.244
- Oh, that is good news to me.
- Welcome home.

20:02.246 --> 20:04.679
And I hope it's good news to you also.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.047
Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Lee.

20:06.049 --> 20:08.416
Okay. I feel like a religious leader,

20:08.418 --> 20:10.084
and somebody has come
back into the fold.

20:10.086 --> 20:11.685
Welcome back.

20:11.687 --> 20:14.488
And I'll end it with, "Excelsior!"

20:14.490 --> 20:16.723
Oh!

20:16.725 --> 20:18.225
Whoo!

20:18.227 --> 20:20.194
We don't know who wrote the Greek myths.

20:20.196 --> 20:22.596
We don't know who created
all the Roman gods,

20:22.598 --> 20:25.732
but we know that Stan Lee
created a modern mythology

20:25.734 --> 20:28.034
that'll outlive us all and
they'll still be talkin' about

20:28.036 --> 20:29.835
hundreds of years from now.

20:29.837 --> 20:32.505
They'll be telling stories
about Hulk and Spider-Man

20:32.507 --> 20:34.907
and Captain America forever.

20:34.909 --> 20:38.211
His imagination will
afford him eternity.

20:38.213 --> 20:39.745
It'll never happen again.

20:39.747 --> 20:44.083
Nobody will ever be responsible
for that many icons...

20:44.085 --> 20:45.950
ever.

20:45.952 --> 20:47.719
Oh, my stars and garters,
that's all the time we have.

20:47.721 --> 20:49.754
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:49.756 --> 20:50.922
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:50.924 --> 20:52.224
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:52.226 --> 20:54.359
Never skate around comics, kids.

20:54.361 --> 20:57.296
Always raise the Stan Lee Cup.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.231
Good night.
