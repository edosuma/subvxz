cthundering'
(bats squeaking)

00:12.763 --> 00:15.641
(embers crackling)

00:21.230 --> 00:24.191
(fireworks booming)

00:32.491 --> 00:35.202
(mystical music)

00:46.171 --> 00:48.715
(techno music)

02:07.252 --> 02:09.463
(coughing)

02:11.089 --> 02:14.384
- Okay, what the fuck is going on?

02:14.426 --> 02:16.511
Who are you people?

02:16.553 --> 02:17.763
Why are you covered in blood?

02:17.804 --> 02:19.556
Why do you have my gun?

02:19.598 --> 02:22.267
Why does my neck hurt, who tased me?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.853
Kris, I fuckin' knew you killed that kid.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.313
I knew you were crazy like that.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.023
I need answers and I need 'em now!

02:28.065 --> 02:30.609
- Shut the fuck up, sit down and listen!

02:33.570 --> 02:35.947
(squealing)

02:35.989 --> 02:39.159
- Oh, mV God, did Vou see
the look on Santa's face?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.370
I do think we made Santa's naughty list.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.289
- That's because Vour
guys' outfits are amazing.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.291
- [Sadie1 I should send
this Santa picture to Brian.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.584
- No, don't even think about it!

02:47.626 --> 02:49.044
That ass clown hasn't called you in weeks!

02:49.086 --> 02:50.087
- We're so putting these up on our

02:50.128 --> 02:51.672
fucking website for the world to see.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.299
- OkaV, so I got the box,
Dahlia you got the wreath.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.384
What'd you get, Alexi?

02:56.510 --> 03:01.682
- I totallV chickened out, but
I bought green nail polish.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.641
- Boring!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.142
Why are you the enemy of fun?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.894
I should just take all of
your Christmas presents

03:05.936 --> 03:07.896
and return them and wrap
you some coal instead.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.774
- You know better than to
mess with me on Christmas.

03:10.816 --> 03:11.608
- Oh, wait a sec.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.820
Um, is tomorrow the holidaV
you've been talking about

03:14.861 --> 03:16.947
every fucking day since Thanksgiving?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.116
- Sure, tease me and then leave me.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.867
It's bad enough that I have
to go to work right now.

03:20.909 --> 03:21.743
- Work?

03:21.785 --> 03:23.161
- Somebody's gotta pay the rent,

03:23.203 --> 03:24.913
unless your dad wants to cover me?

03:24.955 --> 03:27.207
- Well, what if I told
you rent was covered?

03:27.249 --> 03:28.959
- And so's your shift.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.168
- What?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.086
- The only puppies you're gonna

03:31.128 --> 03:33.255
have to worry about today are these.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.756
You're coming with us on an adventure.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.590
Alright?

03:35.632 --> 03:36.508
Merry Christmas, bitch!

03:37.467 --> 03:39.094
- You're crazy, you know that?

03:39.136 --> 03:42.264
- Correction, we're fucking crazy!

03:42.305 --> 03:44.516
(whooping)

03:44.558 --> 03:46.852
(whooshing)

03:49.980 --> 03:54.443
- Hello, devoted fans,
Sadie here and Dahlia.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.696
- With our dear friend, Alexi.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.530
- Hello!

03:58.572 --> 04:00.449
- It's Christmas fucking Eve and we're

04:00.490 --> 04:02.451
on our waV to what might
be the most exciting

04:02.492 --> 04:04.619
urban exploring adventure in history.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.789
- So be sure to log on tomorrow
for the full official video.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.751
- And Vou never know what dirty
things will come your way.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.211
(whooshing)

04:13.253 --> 04:15.797
(techno music)

04:26.641 --> 04:29.770
- Wow, it's so loud in here
I can barely hear myself think.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.275
- [Sadie] That's the point

04:37.235 --> 04:39.029
- [Sadie] There you go.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.989
- What is it Vou guVs do
exactly when you're out there?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.200
- You're telling me
you've never seen a single

04:43.241 --> 04:45.076
one of the Adventure Girls video casts?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.121
- I did once, yeah.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.665
- Okay, then, which adventure was it?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.418
- Uh, it was um, it was the factory one.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.755
Abandoned water park?

04:56.797 --> 04:57.923
I know, I'm a terrible friend.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.257
I haven't watched any of them.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.091
What do you guys do?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.718
Well, I know you go break into weird

05:01.760 --> 05:03.720
places and you film yourselves.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.933
But what is it that urban
explorers actually do?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.893
- I mean, we just go to awesome places,

05:09.935 --> 05:11.394
people don't dare go to.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.355
- And film ourselves running around.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.315
- And then there's the treasures.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.902
- Yeah, we collect one keepsake
from each place we explore.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.988
- Oh, so it's kind of like, um, stealing?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.032
- It's not stealing if it
doesn't belong to anyone.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.826
These places have been closed forever.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.703
I hope Santa Land has some amazing swag!

05:28.745 --> 05:30.080
- So, while you guys are doing all

05:30.121 --> 05:32.082
that awesome stuff, what am I gonna do?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.292
- Have the best fucking Christmas ever!

05:34.334 --> 05:35.126
Woo!

05:39.756 --> 05:42.467
This will have to
do, I have to fucking pee.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.387
(tires screeching)

05:53.687 --> 05:55.564
- Well, it's 12:03, I guess it's

05:55.605 --> 05:57.482
socially acceptable to start drinking.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.238
- Classy joint!

06:15.917 --> 06:18.211
Hi, Merry Christmas!

06:18.253 --> 06:20.338
- Oh, fuck Christmas!

06:20.380 --> 06:21.423
Isn't that right, Cherry?

06:21.464 --> 06:22.924
- You heard him, girls.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.801
Fuck Christmas!

06:24.843 --> 06:25.635
- What?

06:25.677 --> 06:26.887
Christmas is awesome!

06:29.556 --> 06:31.766
(stomping)

06:37.939 --> 06:39.649
- What'll it be?

06:39.691 --> 06:42.569
(glass shattering)

06:45.447 --> 06:47.198
- Merry Christmas, bitches!

06:47.240 --> 06:48.033
- Oh, shit.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.743
- Come on, all this shit you just

06:49.784 --> 06:52.162
buy into with Christmas, it's just that.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.747
It's bullshit!

06:55.624 --> 06:57.709
- This how Vou welcome
out-of-towners, Cherry?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.669
Can't be good for business.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.503
- You know what?

07:00.545 --> 07:01.630
I think we better just go.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.924
- Oh no, you're staying here now, honey.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.675
Looks like you just made a friend.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.761
You joining 'em for drinks, Sean?

07:07.802 --> 07:08.970
- I'm on the clock.

07:09.012 --> 07:09.888
Where's Jerry?

07:12.307 --> 07:13.683
For Christ's sake, Jerry!

07:13.725 --> 07:15.560
You've got to be kidding me!

07:15.602 --> 07:18.563
JerrV, Vou know Vour parole
officer said no costumes!

07:18.605 --> 07:19.689
What is this?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.068
- So what'll it be, girls?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.988
- Um, I think I'll have an eggnog, please.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.165
- [Cherry] Oh, yeah!

07:39.125 --> 07:39.960
- You know what?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.461
I think we're just gonna down these

07:41.503 --> 07:42.337
and get the hell out of here, okay?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.298
- Man, I didn't touch any fucking kids!

07:45.340 --> 07:46.758
- I know, I know, okay.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.593
TheV just want me to take
you in for some questioning.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.136
Now, are you gonna cooperate or are

07:50.178 --> 07:51.596
you gonna give me a hard time?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.516
- HeV, he's been drunk
in my bar for two days.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.727
OnlV gets up to make a
mess in the bathroom.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.812
- Some shit's been going down,

07:58.853 --> 08:01.272
so we're asking the usual suspects.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.649
Pedophiles and such.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.025
- I'm right fucking here, man!

08:04.067 --> 08:05.694
- Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.987
Sex offenders.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.573
- Don't chase him out,
it's my one customer.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.741
That tips!

08:12.909 --> 08:15.036
(blowing)

08:17.831 --> 08:19.708
- I'm sorry to butt in,

08:19.749 --> 08:22.043
but you said some shit was going down.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.294
Anything interesting?

08:24.462 --> 08:27.424
- Uh, yeah, just some bear attacks

08:27.465 --> 08:30.010
and some odd things around town.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.345
- Ooh, bears, production value?

08:33.929 --> 08:36.182
- Honestly, odd isn't the right word.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.144
Look, I don't mean to
cause an alarm or anything,

08:39.184 --> 08:42.522
but some kids have been murdered.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.857
- [Sadie] Oh, my goodness!

08:43.898 --> 08:47.193
- Hey, are you a ranger or a cop?

08:47.235 --> 08:51.114
- Well, Veah, I'm no cop,
but uh, I am packing.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.037
- Shouldn't Vou be chasing
forest fires, not felons?

08:57.078 --> 08:57.954
- Dahlia, shut up.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.416
- AnVwaV, with everVthing
going on around town

09:01.458 --> 09:02.876
and it being Christmas and all,

09:02.917 --> 09:04.753
the police station's a little understaffed

09:04.794 --> 09:07.422
and I know this forest
like the back of my hand.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.923
- Sorry, we didn't mean to waste your time

09:08.965 --> 09:11.092
or ask you all those silly questions.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.427
- No bother, ladies.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.345
I'd rather talk to Vou
than hunt down bears,

09:14.387 --> 09:16.681
but if Vou need anVthing
when you're in town

09:16.723 --> 09:19.851
or see anVthing suspicious,
don't hesitate to call me.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.733
- Ooh, call me!

09:26.775 --> 09:27.734
- Shut up!

09:27.776 --> 09:28.735
(laughs)

09:28.777 --> 09:31.488
- Okay, but seriously, kids murdered?

09:32.363 --> 09:33.448
Maybe we should leave.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.075
- Oh no, no, no, no, I
missed work for this.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.535
We are going on mV first
Adventure Girls mission.

09:39.079 --> 09:39.871
Cheers.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.166
- Hey, yes!

09:43.208 --> 09:44.959
That one is on me!

09:45.001 --> 09:46.920
Now, 20 bucks for the rest.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.174
(tires screeching)

09:51.216 --> 09:53.843
(ominous music)

10:09.692 --> 10:11.653
- It's not as Christmassy as I expected.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.614
Looks creepy, though.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.366
- Well, let's get started.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.327
(laughs)

10:28.545 --> 10:31.089
(creepy music)

10:41.766 --> 10:43.643
- So Vou readV for Vour
first big adventure?

10:43.685 --> 10:46.229
- As ready as I'll ever be, yes!

10:46.271 --> 10:47.689
- [Sadie] Wait, hold up, soldier!

10:47.730 --> 10:48.523
- What?

10:48.565 --> 10:49.983
We're gonna do this, right?

10:50.024 --> 10:52.944
- Oh Veah, we're gonna do
this, but you're not ready yet.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.404
- Shut up, of course, I am.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.363
I'm gonna have fun, come on!

10:55.405 --> 10:58.241
- You're not ready yet, until...

11:03.037 --> 11:04.873
You put on your Christmas uniform!

11:04.914 --> 11:06.332
- Oh, my God!

11:06.374 --> 11:10.378
This is kind of hot looking,
but yeah, okay, okay.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.422
- Yeah, it's better than being an elf.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.509
- I think it's cute.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.889
(techno music)

11:20.930 --> 11:21.723
- Yellow?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.606
White and purple?

11:34.736 --> 11:37.071
- I like the blue one best.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.907
- I think you're right, blue.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.789
- Sadie, our little snowflake
is gonna have a meltdown

11:46.831 --> 11:49.334
when she sees what's inside Santa Land.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.168
(gasping)

11:50.210 --> 11:52.629
And, what do you think of my hot elfness?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.547
Tomorrow when you go online to see

11:54.589 --> 11:55.381
the full length video don't forget

11:55.423 --> 11:57.759
to check out our pics
and like them if you do.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.677
And, I hope you do.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.511
Later!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.389
Did I get it right this time?

12:03.431 --> 12:04.724
- Yeah, you're a natural.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.726
(ominous music)

12:06.768 --> 12:09.187
MaVbe I should call Brian and
let him know where we are.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.021
- [Dahlia And Alexi] No!

12:15.151 --> 12:16.069
- It's Christmas Eve, what if he

12:16.110 --> 12:17.195
tries to get in touch with me?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.279
- He hasn't called you in forever.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.781
Why would you call him now?

12:19.822 --> 12:20.865
He doesn't deserve you!

12:20.907 --> 12:21.699
- But...

12:21.741 --> 12:23.243
- Ho, ho, ho, let's go!

12:32.460 --> 12:34.671
(thudding)

12:39.884 --> 12:41.302
- Awesome!

12:41.344 --> 12:42.887
Merry fucking Christmas!

12:42.929 --> 12:43.846
Wow.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.265
- You know, I thought this place would be

12:45.306 --> 12:47.225
a lot more old and decrepit looking for

12:47.267 --> 12:49.227
the amount of years it's been abandoned.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.231
Don't get me wrong, I
still wanna check it out.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.233
- Don't run, you can't outrun it.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.610
If it's too late to back
away, grab a weapon,

12:57.652 --> 12:59.028
any weapon, to protect yourself.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.699
If without weapons or pepper
spray, curl up and play dead.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.784
Just reading off things to
do in case of a bear attack.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.411
- Is that your idea of fun,

13:06.452 --> 13:07.704
trying to scare the crap out of us?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.789
- I am just being the voice of reason.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.877
- Meet my taser, my voice of reason.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.879
- On that note, I think we're ready.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.429
(ominous music)

13:24.470 --> 13:26.014
- Whoo!

13:26.055 --> 13:27.849
Welcome to Santa Land!

13:28.766 --> 13:32.395
(rock ''Jingle Bells'' music)

13:38.901 --> 13:43.114
- Cool, the most magical
Christmas Eve land of all.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.076
And the Adventure Girls
are gonna explore it!

13:53.666 --> 13:55.293
- Dahlia, go Dahlia!

13:56.419 --> 13:58.629
(grunting)

14:01.466 --> 14:03.801
- You're not gonna make it on heels.

14:03.843 --> 14:08.848
- Oh wait, watch out, watch out.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.820
- What do I know about Santa Land?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.113
- [Sadie1 Yeah, tell
me something about it.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.407
- Well, it's been closed for 20 years.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.576
I heard kids died here.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.535
The only people that come here now

14:29.577 --> 14:31.204
are crack heads and meth heads.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.538
- Oh, my God, what's this?

14:32.580 --> 14:33.790
Oh, awesome!

14:33.831 --> 14:38.002
I wanna eat this mushroom
and then get twice as big.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.880
- Don't let me fall.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.091
Let's go find something else.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.009
- Oh, my God, you guys!

14:45.051 --> 14:46.761
(chattering)

14:46.803 --> 14:48.429
Would you like some tea?

14:50.932 --> 14:53.142
(laughing)

14:59.899 --> 15:02.985
- Someone's gotta tell her
to stop humping things.

15:03.027 --> 15:03.903
It's not sexy.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.156
(banging)

15:07.198 --> 15:09.158
- Oh no, I'm a naughty girl!

15:09.200 --> 15:10.410
- Don't try this at home.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.958
(techno ''Nutcracker'' music)

16:04.297 --> 16:05.256
- Hello?

16:07.008 --> 16:08.843
Any bears in here?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.136
Werewolves?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.096
Unicorns?

16:13.973 --> 16:14.765
Al Qaeda?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.395
No, but other things live in

16:19.437 --> 16:21.731
the forest like birds and squirrels.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.527
And bears, child-eating bears.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.369
(branches cracking)

16:39.290 --> 16:41.250
Okay.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.920
(ominous music)

16:54.263 --> 16:56.390
(humming)

17:00.686 --> 17:02.522
- [Sadie] Welcome to candy cane land!

17:06.067 --> 17:07.818
- Don't you feel like we're being watched?

17:07.859 --> 17:08.653
- Are we?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.113
Yeah, I kind of do feel
like I'm being watched.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.240
(banjo music)

17:12.281 --> 17:13.699
Is that your new ringtone, sicko?

17:13.741 --> 17:15.367
- Yes.
- Oh, my God!

17:15.409 --> 17:16.993
We'll see who's laughing when you're

17:17.036 --> 17:19.079
hog-tied and squealing for my help.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.998
Ooh, you got a purdy mouth!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.416
- Stop it, Vou're gonna
fuck up my makeup, geez!

17:25.044 --> 17:27.672
(ominous music)

17:32.134 --> 17:34.804
- At this point I don't think
it makes any difference.

17:36.097 --> 17:36.889
- I found Jerry.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.476
He was getting wasted at
Cherry's just like Sean said.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.438
- Neil, what the hell are you doing?

17:44.480 --> 17:47.024
There is no waV in hell that
this guy could have done it!

17:47.066 --> 17:48.734
Now, cut him loose!

17:50.069 --> 17:51.696
- Come on, Jerry.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.780
Sorry about this.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.824
- Merry Christmas.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.658
- Get out of here.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.867
- Fuck you, Jerry.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.119
- [Neil] See you at poker.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.625
(sighs)

18:04.667 --> 18:06.419
- [Bruce] What is it?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.462
- I was just thinking about the Bernards.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.299
I mean, seeing her lying there like that,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.176
in all that blood with
her heart ripped out.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.762
(techno music)

18:20.766 --> 18:21.559
It was--

18:21.601 --> 18:22.393
- [Bruce] Disgusting.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.227
- It was gross.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.398
What kind of monster could
do something like that?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.650
- Officer Green seems
to think it was a bear.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.238
- A bear with a lot of anger.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.449
A lot of hurt feelings.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.162
- You know, Neil, I'm a
little worried about you.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.372
You hang in there, kid.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.790
- Alright, good luck.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.543
- [Bruce] Be back in a couple hours.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.257
(ominous music)

19:09.940 --> 19:12.360
- Ugh, looks like someone
got slaughtered here.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.905
I am dreaming!

19:15.946 --> 19:17.531
- [Sadie] It's perfect!

19:17.573 --> 19:19.325
- [Alexi] What, I can't see anything.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.744
- Our treasures, they're inside.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.205
(grunting)

19:24.246 --> 19:25.039
(gasps)

19:25.081 --> 19:26.165
Jackpot!

19:27.833 --> 19:29.251
Oh, I want this one!

19:29.293 --> 19:30.086
- Look!

19:31.087 --> 19:33.464
Here's your first treasure, Alexi.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.674
- Um, that's okay?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.050
- You're saving it from a bulldozer

19:36.092 --> 19:37.927
in a few months, of course, it's okay.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.181
- Hey Adventure Girl people, fans!

19:42.223 --> 19:43.724
- Hey guys, look, we got our shit.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.477
We gotta get the fuck out of
here before our luck runs out.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.980
- Wait, hey guys, we didn't go there yet.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.279
(mysterious music)

20:07.748 --> 20:09.709
(sighs)

20:15.965 --> 20:19.176
Okay, point taken and rejected.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.388
(laughs)

20:25.099 --> 20:28.811
(door creaking and slamming)

20:31.272 --> 20:34.150
(mysterious music)

20:40.823 --> 20:43.033
(growling)

20:53.586 --> 20:58.549
Oh, look! (laughs)

21:08.058 --> 21:09.351
- [Dahlia] Whoa.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.694
- Ha, I dare you to eat this.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.112
- Oh no, that's gross.

21:20.154 --> 21:23.073
- Come on, your audience awaits.

21:28.746 --> 21:29.538
I dare you!

21:29.580 --> 21:31.373
- I don't think so, it's nasty.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.792
- [Sadie] Nom, nom, nom.

21:32.833 --> 21:33.626
- Uh-uh.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.044
- What happened here?

21:35.085 --> 21:37.713
- Ugh, a fucked up ice orgy?

21:37.755 --> 21:39.924
- Oh, that's a good name for a band.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.175
Oh!

21:41.217 --> 21:42.927
(growling)

21:42.968 --> 21:44.720
(all gasping)

21:44.762 --> 21:45.805
- What is it?

21:57.900 --> 22:00.110
(plopping)

22:11.747 --> 22:13.040
(cell phone ringing)

22:13.082 --> 22:16.126
Croaring)
(screaming)

22:16.168 --> 22:19.004
(dramatic music)

22:19.046 --> 22:21.841
(roaring)

22:21.882 --> 22:24.176
(screaming)

22:27.179 --> 22:29.306
(banging)

22:30.724 --> 22:32.852
(roaring)

22:41.193 --> 22:42.653
- [Santa] Krampus!

22:46.156 --> 22:47.408
- What the fuck is it?

22:47.449 --> 22:49.910
- Get the hell outta here now!

22:55.165 --> 22:58.460
(country music)

22:58.502 --> 22:59.295
- Fuck!

23:00.671 --> 23:04.717
- (choking) In the cottage, now!

23:07.094 --> 23:09.305
(grunting)

23:12.182 --> 23:13.017
- What the hell do we do now?

23:13.058 --> 23:14.351
Good idea, call 91 1!

23:16.103 --> 23:17.146
- It's me.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.772
- What, what does she mean it's me?

23:18.814 --> 23:19.607
Who the hell are you calling?

23:19.648 --> 23:21.483
- [Sadie] Brian, we're in danger!

23:21.525 --> 23:22.318
- Brian?

23:22.359 --> 23:23.152
Gimme that!
- No!

23:29.074 --> 23:30.409
(telephone ringing)

23:30.451 --> 23:31.243
- Hello?

23:32.161 --> 23:33.037
He hung up.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.372
It's been like this all day.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.540
- Get out of--

23:39.293 --> 23:40.711
91 1, what's your emergency?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.796
- Hi, yeah, I think we're being attacked!

23:44.632 --> 23:46.300
- Oh God, another one.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.595
Okay, stay calm.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.180
Where are you located?

23:51.221 --> 23:52.139
- Santa Land.

23:54.183 --> 23:58.103
- Santa Land, off the S6, but
that was shut down years ago.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.105
- Yes, yes, that one.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.358
(growling)

24:03.817 --> 24:05.819
- Alright, and who's attacking you?

24:07.321 --> 24:11.367
- I don't know, some big, hairy thing!

24:11.408 --> 24:13.619
(growling)

24:17.081 --> 24:18.540
A bear or something!

24:18.582 --> 24:21.961
And a man, I think he's the owner.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.337
- Let me get this straight.

24:23.379 --> 24:27.716
You're in Santa Land,
so you are trespassing.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.386
- No, no, we're just--

24:30.427 --> 24:32.930
- [Sadie] I smell gingerbread!

24:32.972 --> 24:34.056
- Hurry!

24:34.098 --> 24:35.641
- Is this some kind of practical joke?

24:35.683 --> 24:36.934
- No, no, we're--

24:36.976 --> 24:40.354
- Is anVbodV actuallV
injured or in danger?

24:40.396 --> 24:41.981
- No, we're fine!

24:42.022 --> 24:44.858
But that is onlV because we're
barricaded in his cottage!

24:47.111 --> 24:49.029
- A bear sent you into his cottage?

24:49.071 --> 24:51.115
Listen, who do you think you are?

24:51.156 --> 24:53.951
You're trVing to pull
some kind of shit on me

24:53.993 --> 24:55.869
and Vou should be ashamed
of yourself, okay,

24:55.911 --> 24:59.081
because tonight it's Jesus'
birthday, so goodbye!

24:59.123 --> 25:00.833
(phone clicking)

25:00.874 --> 25:01.667
- Asshole!

25:01.709 --> 25:03.711
Hung up on me!

25:03.752 --> 25:06.714
Oh, we're fucking fucked.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.756
We're fucking fucked.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.930
(growling)

25:14.972 --> 25:15.973
(banging door)

25:16.015 --> 25:18.308
(screaming)

25:20.769 --> 25:22.146
- Sadie, help us!

25:29.278 --> 25:31.155
- Now, let's try to arm ourselves, okay?

25:31.196 --> 25:31.989
- Yeah.

25:32.031 --> 25:32.823
- Okay.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.785
(cell phone dialing)

25:36.827 --> 25:38.662
- Hi, please don't hang up!

25:38.704 --> 25:41.790
Okay, we're trapped inside Santa Land.

25:41.832 --> 25:45.544
Our van got towed and we have
no way of getting out of here!

25:46.670 --> 25:49.214
- This is 91 1, not a car service.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.428
- Why do they keep doing that?

26:03.520 --> 26:05.647
(roof creaking)

26:05.689 --> 26:07.816
(gasping)

26:08.984 --> 26:11.195
(clomping)

26:18.660 --> 26:20.996
(whooshing)

26:27.669 --> 26:29.963
(screaming)

26:31.006 --> 26:33.217
(punching)

26:34.093 --> 26:35.052
- Stop it, now!

26:35.094 --> 26:36.970
Come on, would you stop it now?

26:37.012 --> 26:37.805
Stop it.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.808
(yelling)

26:40.849 --> 26:41.934
(punching)

26:41.975 --> 26:42.851
Ow!

26:42.893 --> 26:44.937
- What are you gonna do you fat fuck, huh?

26:44.978 --> 26:46.563
- I'm not fat, you're fat.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.233
(girls yelling)

26:52.361 --> 26:56.782
Czapping)
(thudding)

27:01.537 --> 27:03.372
Now, that's enough!

27:03.413 --> 27:04.206
Sit.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.715
That should keep him out for now.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.925
- What the hell was that?

27:14.967 --> 27:17.177
- You know, I'm verV
disappointed in you girls.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.429
All of you have been very naughty.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.390
You've been trespassing on my property

27:21.431 --> 27:22.975
and you're fucking my shit up!

27:23.016 --> 27:24.643
- That's our motto!

27:25.894 --> 27:27.729
- We weren't trespassing on your property,

27:27.771 --> 27:29.231
we were just exploring.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.066
- Oh, enough of this
bullshit, I don't care.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.443
You guys gotta get out of here.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.738
Go into town, take mV
bike, and get your van.

27:36.780 --> 27:37.698
- Fuck that!

27:37.739 --> 27:39.032
There's some Bigfoot out there

27:39.074 --> 27:40.784
and we're not calling the police?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.911
- Yeah, forget it, I'm calling Sean.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.583
- This is not for the police.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.961
- Hillbillies are crazy!

27:51.003 --> 27:53.046
- I'm not a hillbilly, you're a hillbilly.

27:54.715 --> 27:55.883
- I don't know who's crazier,

27:55.924 --> 27:58.302
this magician, or that wildebeest.

27:58.343 --> 28:01.847
But, I am reporting Vour ass
to the ASPCA, just so you know.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.266
- OkaV, hold on, just
hold on for a second.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.102
I need to explain.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.193
I don't know how to say this.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.111
I never thought I'd have to say this.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.280
- Spit it out, already!

28:18.322 --> 28:19.531
- Would you listen!

28:20.949 --> 28:22.159
This is my property

28:24.536 --> 28:25.621
and I'm Santa.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.416
Hence, Santa Land.

28:30.751 --> 28:34.046
I'm the real fucking deal, Santa.

28:34.087 --> 28:37.758
And that thing out
there, that is no animal.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.261
That's Krampus.

28:45.974 --> 28:46.767
Krampus?

28:48.602 --> 28:49.394
Krampus.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.188
Krampus!

28:52.564 --> 28:55.567
Oh, goddamn it, I'm
Santa and that's Krampus!

28:55.609 --> 28:56.944
The devil of Christmas!

29:02.074 --> 29:02.866
Krampus!

29:07.287 --> 29:09.790
- And I'm the fucking tooth fairy.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.667
- Oh yeah, that's really adorable.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.752
Oh, if you only knew.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.004
(grunting)

29:20.801 --> 29:21.927
Want a cookie?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.350
(telephone ringing)

29:28.392 --> 29:29.476
- [Bruce] Come on!

29:29.518 --> 29:30.894
- 911, what's your emergency?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.063
Where?

29:33.939 --> 29:35.065
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.024
- [Bruce] Come on.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.484
- You've gotta speak slower I can't--

29:37.526 --> 29:41.655
Where did Vou find the body?
- Sit down, sit down!

29:41.697 --> 29:43.740
- Another damn body, Bruce!

29:43.782 --> 29:46.576
Missing kids, prank calls!

29:46.618 --> 29:48.787
I just can't take this anymore. (crying)

29:48.829 --> 29:51.665
Yes, honey, I'm here, I'm still here.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.500
We'll send Vou somebody--
- Son of a bitch!

29:53.542 --> 29:56.211
- [Operator1 Right awaV,
just give us the address.

29:56.253 --> 29:59.006
(dramatic music)

30:03.969 --> 30:06.221
(growling)

30:15.272 --> 30:19.818
Csquishing)
(slurping)

30:44.634 --> 30:46.845
(dripping)

31:26.051 --> 31:28.261
(whistles)

31:32.099 --> 31:34.184
- Oh, he's a beast, alright.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.354
If you only knew.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.731
He's also part man and part devil.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.776
Krampus is a killer!

31:44.611 --> 31:45.987
He's also my fucking partner.

31:46.905 --> 31:47.697
- Can Santa say fuck?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.908
- No, that is what
redneck freaks say before

31:49.950 --> 31:52.619
they hang you on meat hooks as decoration.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.748
Okay, Santa Claus, we're gonna leave you

31:56.790 --> 31:58.542
and your killer Wookiee here alone

31:58.583 --> 32:00.836
and we're gonna get the hell out of here.

32:00.877 --> 32:04.631
- Alexi, did Vou not see that
little spectacle over there?

32:04.673 --> 32:07.217
Did you not see my magic cane?

32:08.176 --> 32:10.679
- Santa doesn't walk around with a cane.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.266
- The cane comes with me,
not that your folklore

32:14.307 --> 32:18.145
ever covers that because no
one's ever seen me in action.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.396
- Did you just call me Alexi?

32:19.438 --> 32:24.401
- Yes, Vou are Alexi and Vou
are Dahlia and you are Sadie.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.867
- He's some stalker fan, I knew it.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.411
- Wait, have Vou been creeping
on us this whole time?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.496
- Ever since you were born.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.414
- [Sadie] Gross!

32:37.456 --> 32:40.375
- Oh, come on stop it,
you're wasting my time!

32:40.417 --> 32:42.711
I've been in all your houses at Christmas!

32:44.421 --> 32:47.632
What is it gonna take,
huh, for you to believe me?

32:47.674 --> 32:50.385
Do I have to take flight,
presents magically appear?

32:50.427 --> 32:52.012
What do you want, what do you want?

32:52.053 --> 32:52.846
What do you want?

32:52.888 --> 32:57.434
- Well, if Vou're reallV
Santa you'd know what I want.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.061
- (sighs) Fine!

33:00.103 --> 33:02.230
(zapping)

33:03.648 --> 33:04.483
- Oh, my God, yay!

33:09.779 --> 33:12.491
(dramatic music)

33:29.049 --> 33:33.512
Croaring)
(screaming)

33:36.348 --> 33:37.140
- So.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.977
(camera beeping)

33:42.812 --> 33:45.690
Santa, how do you fit down the chimney?

33:47.609 --> 33:48.777
- Magic, of course.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.864
Krampus also uses the chimney,

33:52.906 --> 33:54.866
that's why I blocked mine just in case.

33:55.909 --> 33:57.536
Ha, ha, I know what you're thinking.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.455
What about the houses without chimneys?

34:00.497 --> 34:02.666
I've got other ways of getting in.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.960
I'm telling you not everyone is

34:05.001 --> 34:08.088
so pleased to see me pay a visit.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.005
Here, look at this.

34:10.047 --> 34:10.840
(girls gasping)

34:10.882 --> 34:11.675
Yeah.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.176
- [Dahlia] Nice!

34:13.217 --> 34:14.177
- How do you get to everybody

34:14.219 --> 34:16.763
in the world in just one night?

34:16.804 --> 34:18.431
- More magic.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.559
You see, he only gets the bad ones.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.520
And I'm talking, the really bad children.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.607
- How do you make those reindeer fly?

34:27.649 --> 34:29.192
- (sighs) Magic!

34:31.860 --> 34:33.029
- Wait a second!

34:33.071 --> 34:35.031
Where are your reindeer?

34:35.072 --> 34:37.951
And where's Mrs. Claus
and where are your elves?

34:37.993 --> 34:40.579
- WhV don't Vou tell me how
you walk in those heels?

34:42.831 --> 34:43.956
- Magic.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.083
- Right.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.502
See now that's all Vou reallV
need to know about that.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.753
- Yeah, yeah, we get it.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.547
He's bad news, ooh!

34:59.014 --> 35:02.976
- My personal story is just not as

35:03.018 --> 35:05.186
charming as the one that you know of.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.026
(whooshing)

35:14.446 --> 35:17.157
There's no such thing as
a naughty or nice list.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.746
I bring Vou presents, but
Krampus shreds your ass.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.458
(siren blaring)

35:26.499 --> 35:30.420
In the '40s your culture banned Krampus.

35:31.421 --> 35:33.840
God forbid they should scare a

35:33.882 --> 35:36.092
little morality into the children.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.054
Krampus was out of the
picture in society's eyes.

35:39.095 --> 35:43.642
And Vou know, quite honestlV,
they didn't need me anymore.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.102
Toys were made in factories.

35:46.144 --> 35:50.398
Presents bought, Santa's sit
on their fat asses in malls.

35:51.566 --> 35:54.277
A tough decision, but I
wasn't needed anymore.

35:55.945 --> 35:59.115
So I started this place
so that I could see

35:59.157 --> 36:01.701
the joy in the children's eyes once again.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.745
I had very high hopes for it, but...

36:05.080 --> 36:06.164
I've been fighting a losing battle

36:06.206 --> 36:07.957
to hold on to this land mainly because

36:07.999 --> 36:10.043
I've got Krampus frozen out there.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.837
Had, had Krampus frozen out there.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.299
(whooshing)

36:18.802 --> 36:22.180
Now, you can take Santa out of Christmas,

36:24.224 --> 36:26.518
but Vou can't take the
Christmas out of Santa.

36:32.148 --> 36:32.941
I don't know.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.361
Well, I got him without his magic switch

36:36.403 --> 36:39.322
and I put him on ice and I left

36:39.364 --> 36:41.408
the North Pole and I never looked behind.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.706
He's my responsibility.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.084
More like my curse.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.920
I don't know how he got his switch

36:53.962 --> 36:55.964
or how he got out of that ice,

36:56.005 --> 36:58.717
but one thing's for sure;
Krampus is out of retirement.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.305
(dramatic music)

37:08.601 --> 37:10.186
(telephone ringing)

37:10.228 --> 37:12.147
- 911, what's your emergency?

37:13.106 --> 37:14.816
Okay, calm down.

37:14.858 --> 37:15.775
Are they breathing?

37:17.444 --> 37:18.278
Mutilated?

37:19.863 --> 37:20.822
The kids, too?

37:23.199 --> 37:27.370
Bruce, they found more kids, dead.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.623
I mean really, really, really dead.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.209
(techno music)

37:37.213 --> 37:37.964
- Damn it!

37:38.923 --> 37:40.884
The team's tied up on Lake Drive.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.887
Dispatch Officer Green and Sean.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.234
- Come on, everybody.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.068
Come on, think.

37:59.110 --> 37:59.903
Come on, think, think!

37:59.944 --> 38:01.362
We need to come up with a plan here.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.197
- Yeah, I've got one!

38:02.238 --> 38:03.239
How about we go to the police and tell

38:03.281 --> 38:04.949
them about your fucking boyfriend?

38:04.991 --> 38:06.743
- No, you can't do that!

38:06.785 --> 38:09.662
What are Vou gonna do,
tell them I'm Santa Claus?

38:09.704 --> 38:12.707
No, no, plus theV'll
kill Krampus on sight.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.877
I can't have that, he cannot be killed.

38:15.919 --> 38:16.711
- What?

38:16.753 --> 38:17.587
- I can't have that.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.591
(stammering)

38:23.927 --> 38:25.595
Krampus cannot be killed!

38:25.637 --> 38:26.513
We're connected...

38:27.680 --> 38:30.767
It's just, it would just
be very bad, very bad.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.477
- Yeah, well, I think human
lives are a little bit

38:32.519 --> 38:33.937
more important than blowing your cover.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.689
- You'll just have to trust
me, there's more at stake here.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.193
After being trapped all of these years

38:40.235 --> 38:42.362
I can just imagine how hungry he is.

38:44.405 --> 38:45.573
- Well, what does he eat?

38:45.615 --> 38:47.575
- Uh, that's not what I mean.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.036
Krampus kills children.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.374
He puts them in that basket
and then he takes them to hell.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.292
- Wait, wait, wait, I saw that basket.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.710
I saw it when we were in the freezer.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.505
He was taking these slimV
hairballs from the basket

39:00.547 --> 39:02.632
and putting them into the Christmas boxes.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.008
- No, you're wrong, he takes them to hell.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.885
- No, I know what we saw.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.930
We were spying on him until he noticed us

39:08.972 --> 39:10.932
and I swear he was taking
those little hairballs,

39:10.974 --> 39:14.060
those disgusting little hairballs
and putting them in boxes.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.980
- All those kids the
ranger was talking about.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.190
- No, no, no, those hairballs,

39:19.232 --> 39:21.943
as you call them, they go to hell!

39:21.985 --> 39:22.819
Not here!

39:24.863 --> 39:27.115
Why, why is he taking all these

39:27.156 --> 39:29.909
children now, before Christmas?

39:31.494 --> 39:32.787
They can't all be naughty.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.125
What is he up to?

39:43.381 --> 39:46.301
- Speaking of naughtV,
I think I have a plan.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.932
(music fast forwarding)

39:55.643 --> 39:58.646
- Where's my milk and cookies?

39:58.688 --> 40:00.481
- Oh, come on, Mom!

40:00.523 --> 40:01.941
That's the best part.

40:03.610 --> 40:06.988
- Oh, I know sweetie, but it's late

40:07.030 --> 40:09.157
and that stuff alwaVs
gives you nightmares.

40:09.991 --> 40:10.950
- Bed wetter.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.535
- Hey, I'm not a bed wetter!

40:12.577 --> 40:14.329
- I'm not a bed wetter.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.247
- Just that one time.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.999
- [Teenager] You're such a baby.

40:18.041 --> 40:22.587
- Can Vou please stop
picking on your brother?

40:22.629 --> 40:23.755
- Quit picking on your brother.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.715
I'm so over this place!

40:26.758 --> 40:28.676
- Alright then, just go to bed.

40:28.718 --> 40:29.844
- Gladly.

40:29.886 --> 40:30.762
Sleep tight.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.890
Don't let the homicidal hillbillies bite.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.600
- Don't worry, mom.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.937
I can protect Vou from those
homicidal hillbillies.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.813
(laughs)

40:40.855 --> 40:41.648
Goodnight.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.108
- Goodnight, sweetie.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.234
I love you.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.236
- [Boy] I love you, too.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.839
(growling)

41:12.261 --> 41:17.225
Cscreaming)
(glass shattering)

41:17.892 --> 41:20.603
(chilling music)

41:37.954 --> 41:39.747
(screaming)

41:39.789 --> 41:41.916
(roaring)

41:47.213 --> 41:48.381
- Here.

41:48.423 --> 41:49.215
Here.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.763
Once we get him now,
we've gotta trap him till

41:55.805 --> 41:58.057
after midnight and then we're home free.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.767
Well, until I freeze him up again.

41:59.809 --> 42:00.601
- [Dahlia] Why midnight?

42:00.643 --> 42:02.186
- [Alexi] Well, it's Christmas.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.647
- Yeah, and if he takes off without me

42:04.689 --> 42:07.025
the whole world is going to hell.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.486
(growling)

42:10.528 --> 42:12.196
Even more than killing children

42:12.238 --> 42:15.033
he loves women, especially
the naughty ones.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.660
He'll sniff you three out in no time.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.454
- Let's get naughty!

42:21.873 --> 42:24.000
(roaring)

42:30.214 --> 42:31.007
Goddamn it!

42:34.761 --> 42:36.471
(spraying)

42:36.512 --> 42:37.889
Krampus!

42:37.930 --> 42:39.432
Goddamn!

42:39.474 --> 42:40.641
Piss!

42:40.683 --> 42:41.768
Shit!

42:41.809 --> 42:46.773
Motherfuckin' phooeV!

42:47.648 --> 42:49.942

42:49.984 --> 42:52.862

42:55.073 --> 42:57.492
Goddamn, piss, shit, motherfuckin'phooey!

42:57.533 --> 43:00.203
Goddamn, piss, shit, motherfuckin'phooey!

43:00.244 --> 43:01.496
(roaring)

43:01.537 --> 43:06.084
Cthudding)
(screaming)

43:07.794 --> 43:09.670
Get the fuck off me!

43:09.712 --> 43:12.006
(screaming)

43:16.469 --> 43:19.097
(slobbering)

43:19.138 --> 43:21.474
(thudding)

43:21.516 --> 43:24.143
(taser buzzing)

43:25.186 --> 43:29.315
I've never been so happV
to see your fucking face!

43:31.567 --> 43:33.611
(crying)

43:42.453 --> 43:44.539
(gun firing)

43:44.580 --> 43:46.791
(vomiting)

43:50.294 --> 43:51.629
- Jesus, Sean.

43:54.799 --> 43:56.134
- What's going on, buddy?

43:56.175 --> 43:57.468
- It's bad, Sean.

43:59.220 --> 44:00.805
It got both of them.

44:00.847 --> 44:02.390
- Both of Harrison's girls?

44:02.431 --> 44:04.058
- Yeah, both.

44:04.100 --> 44:07.395
Never seen anVthing
like it in all my life.

44:07.436 --> 44:09.814
We're gonna have to call in
the big guns, that's all.

44:11.023 --> 44:12.942
- I can't write this report.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.235
- Oh, the hell you can't!

44:18.781 --> 44:19.574
- I don't get it.

44:19.615 --> 44:22.243
Why do we need the FBI on a bear attack?

44:22.285 --> 44:25.872
- Look, man, the entire Vard
is enclosed, it's gated in.

44:25.913 --> 44:28.875
We couldn't find a single
break in the gate anywhere.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.126
Not one.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.961
- What are you saying?

44:33.212 --> 44:36.966
- Their little hearts were ripped out.

44:37.008 --> 44:39.802
Sean, this ain't no bear.

44:49.228 --> 44:53.357
- This fucking guV is not
gonna ruin my favorite holiday.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.400
- How did Santa get here?

44:54.442 --> 44:56.319
- I don't know, he was right behind us.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.241
- Santa?

45:02.283 --> 45:04.202
- Some lookout he is!

45:04.243 --> 45:06.078
- Shit, is he dead?

45:06.120 --> 45:07.663
(snoring)

45:07.705 --> 45:08.706
- No, he's breathing.

45:10.791 --> 45:13.044
Old man's not dead, just useless.

45:13.085 --> 45:14.045
- Alright, yeah.

45:15.046 --> 45:15.838
Oh, shit.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.467
- Yummy, yummy!

45:19.508 --> 45:20.801
(sniffing)

45:20.843 --> 45:22.386
(growling)

45:22.428 --> 45:24.472
- We've gotta tie him up.

45:27.350 --> 45:30.478
- [Alexi] Can you get this over there?

45:40.488 --> 45:42.823
- He's seriously down for the count, guys.

45:43.741 --> 45:44.784
Picture time?

45:44.825 --> 45:45.618
- Yeah!

45:46.702 --> 45:49.247
(techno music)

46:02.635 --> 46:04.262
Hello!

46:04.303 --> 46:05.554
Hi.
- Hello.

46:05.596 --> 46:06.555
One at a time.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.891
Krampus, ho, ho, ho.

46:08.933 --> 46:10.851
Not so tough now, are you?

46:10.893 --> 46:13.854
- He looks like some sort of
fucked up reindeer, doesn't he?

46:15.690 --> 46:18.192
Look at this little puppy.

46:18.234 --> 46:19.944
I'm the Krampus, oh.

46:19.986 --> 46:21.153
Count of three.

46:21.195 --> 46:22.530
- [Both] One, two, three, Krampus!

46:23.739 --> 46:26.450
(bells jingling)

46:27.994 --> 46:28.869
- [Bruce] It's me.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.329
Listen, listen to me.

46:32.290 --> 46:33.082
This is the Sheriff.

46:33.124 --> 46:37.670
Look, I want Vou to get out
to Santa Land and I mean now.

46:38.587 --> 46:40.131
You got that?

46:40.172 --> 46:41.007
Go, get on it.

46:44.302 --> 46:45.970
(snoring)

46:46.012 --> 46:48.389
- [Dahlia] Ha, ha, we got you!

46:48.431 --> 46:49.849
- Let's clean you up and then maybe

46:49.890 --> 46:51.100
we'll get home in time for Christmas.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.101
- Okay, let's go.

46:52.143 --> 46:52.935
- Okay.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.729
Dahlia, you on board?

46:54.770 --> 46:56.230
- Yeah, he'll be fine.

46:59.358 --> 47:01.277
(growling)

47:01.319 --> 47:03.237
(roaring)

47:03.279 --> 47:04.071
- No!

47:05.239 --> 47:07.241
Croaring)
(screaming)

47:07.283 --> 47:08.075
Krampus!

47:11.203 --> 47:13.080
Krampus, that's enough!

47:16.876 --> 47:19.086
(groaning)

47:28.220 --> 47:29.013
Wow!

47:30.348 --> 47:31.140
Go!

47:34.060 --> 47:34.852
Go!

47:36.937 --> 47:38.814
(roaring)

47:38.856 --> 47:43.652
- Hi-ya! (thudding)

47:47.156 --> 47:50.326
(Krampus whimpering)

47:50.368 --> 47:52.244
- I think I wet myself.

48:18.104 --> 48:19.397
- [Brian] Sadie!

48:23.901 --> 48:25.277
Sadie!

48:25.319 --> 48:27.655
- Does Krampus talk?

48:27.696 --> 48:28.489
- Never.

48:29.490 --> 48:30.282
- Sadie!

48:32.743 --> 48:34.328
Sadie!

48:34.370 --> 48:35.162
Sadie, oh, mV God!
- Brian!

48:36.330 --> 48:37.623
You came for me!

48:39.041 --> 48:40.960
- [Brian1 Of course I did,
I was worried about you.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.128
- You were?

48:42.169 --> 48:43.212
- Of course, I was.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.755
What the hell is going on here?

48:45.923 --> 48:49.009
What weird shit has Dahlia
gotten you into this time?

48:49.051 --> 48:50.469
- It's a long story.

48:52.513 --> 48:55.141
(ominous music)

49:05.443 --> 49:09.196
In a nutshell, we're trVing
to help the real-life Santa.

49:09.238 --> 49:10.030
- 'Sup?

49:11.282 --> 49:12.658
- Fight the evil Krampus.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.037
- Great, my girlfriend's on drugs.

49:19.623 --> 49:20.666
- I'm your girlfriend?

49:22.418 --> 49:24.253
(crunching)

49:24.295 --> 49:26.505
(screaming)

49:26.547 --> 49:28.841
(squirting)

49:29.758 --> 49:31.886
(roaring)

49:40.019 --> 49:41.312
- What the shit?

49:46.775 --> 49:47.568
- Sean!

49:48.986 --> 49:49.778
Sean?

49:52.740 --> 49:54.283
Answer, goddamn it!

49:55.951 --> 49:57.578
(dramatic music)

49:57.620 --> 49:59.079
- [Santa] Krampus!

50:02.124 --> 50:04.710
(zapping)

50:04.752 --> 50:06.962
(thudding)

50:12.384 --> 50:13.594
- [Sadie] No!

50:13.636 --> 50:14.845
No!

50:14.887 --> 50:19.850
Brian, no! (sobbing)

50:20.476 --> 50:24.104
(electricity zapping)

50:24.146 --> 50:26.357
(grunting)

50:33.572 --> 50:35.783
(punching)

50:37.826 --> 50:39.828
(screaming)

50:39.870 --> 50:41.455
- What the fuck is going on?

50:41.497 --> 50:43.832
(girls yelling)

50:43.874 --> 50:45.125
- We've gotta get out of here!

50:45.167 --> 50:46.085
- [Sadie] He killed Brian!

50:46.126 --> 50:47.253
- Are you okay?

50:47.294 --> 50:48.963
- [Sadie] He killed my Brian!

50:49.004 --> 50:49.797
- [Sean] Who?

50:49.838 --> 50:50.631
- He killed Brian!

50:50.673 --> 50:51.465
- [Sean] Who?

50:51.507 --> 50:52.800
- He killed him!

50:52.841 --> 50:54.510
- [Santa] Krampus!

50:54.552 --> 50:55.344
- Oh, shit.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.929
Put the weapon down now!

50:56.971 --> 50:58.305
Hey, you, put that down!

50:58.347 --> 51:00.975
(taser zapping)

51:03.727 --> 51:05.771
- Come on, over there, you know the drill.

51:05.813 --> 51:07.231
Go on, go on.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.817
- Officer Green just
called in and said Sean

51:09.858 --> 51:11.735
is not responding to his radio.

51:12.736 --> 51:13.946
Have you heard from him?

51:13.988 --> 51:15.614
- As a matter of fact, I have.

51:15.656 --> 51:20.452
TheV had a report of a strange
truck at old man Kris's.

51:20.494 --> 51:22.538
He went up there to investigate.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.541
- You mean, Santa Land?

51:25.583 --> 51:26.375
- [Bruce] Yeah.

51:28.586 --> 51:30.754
- Shit, I need a cigarette!

51:30.796 --> 51:32.423
- [Bruce] What?

51:32.464 --> 51:33.799
- Oh, look at you.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.677
- What are you doing?

51:36.719 --> 51:37.928
- [Operator] Alright.

51:37.970 --> 51:38.762
(telephone ringing)

51:38.804 --> 51:39.722
- [Bruce] Whose gonna answer the phone?

51:39.763 --> 51:41.181
- [Operator] You are.

51:41.223 --> 51:42.725
- Police department, hello?

51:43.934 --> 51:44.727
Hello?

51:46.270 --> 51:48.272
I don't know how to work it!

51:48.314 --> 51:49.481
(telephone ringing)

51:49.523 --> 51:50.608
Get off the cookies!

51:58.240 --> 52:00.451
(coughing)

52:02.411 --> 52:05.414
- Okay, what the fuck is going on?

52:05.456 --> 52:07.458
Who are you people?

52:07.499 --> 52:08.792
Why are you covered in blood?

52:08.834 --> 52:10.586
Why do you have my gun?

52:10.628 --> 52:13.255
Why does my neck hurt, who tased me?

52:13.297 --> 52:15.883
Kris, I fucking knew you killed that kid!

52:15.924 --> 52:17.343
I knew you were crazy like that!

52:17.384 --> 52:18.927
I need answers and I need 'em now!

52:18.969 --> 52:21.639
- Shut the fuck up, sit down and listen!

52:23.223 --> 52:24.642
- You have to help us.

52:24.683 --> 52:26.143
We need your help.

52:26.185 --> 52:28.604
He killed Brian, he's gonna kill everyone.

52:28.646 --> 52:29.813
- That's the thing.

52:29.855 --> 52:32.149
- It all seems reallV
crazy, but he didn't do it.

52:32.191 --> 52:33.692
He didn't kill Brian.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.444
The real killer's out there!

52:35.486 --> 52:36.487
He's Santa.

52:39.198 --> 52:41.492
- You picked a hell of a day to do this.

52:41.533 --> 52:43.577
(laughs)

52:44.662 --> 52:46.914
- Look, he's Santa Claus!

52:48.707 --> 52:51.168
- Why are all the hot ones crazy?

52:51.210 --> 52:53.921
Look, this is old man Kris.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.631
Everyone knows Kris.

52:55.673 --> 52:57.216
He used to run Santa Land back in the day,

52:57.257 --> 52:59.134
but now he's just an old hermit.

52:59.176 --> 52:59.968
- Excuse me?

53:00.010 --> 53:03.097
- And he's going to jail
for a very long time

53:03.138 --> 53:05.265
just like you and you and you.

53:05.307 --> 53:06.392
- The hell we are!

53:07.267 --> 53:09.895
(girls yelling)

53:13.148 --> 53:14.358
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

53:14.400 --> 53:15.484
One at a time, one at a time!

53:15.526 --> 53:16.318
You!

53:16.360 --> 53:17.986
- So there's this creature, right?

53:18.028 --> 53:22.533
He's like this big, hairV animal
with these horns, you know?

53:22.574 --> 53:23.367
Um--

53:23.409 --> 53:24.201
- Krampus!

53:24.243 --> 53:25.786
- Yeah.

53:25.828 --> 53:28.163
- Look, I've seen enough mangled kids

53:28.205 --> 53:29.957
in the past week to last a lifetime.

53:30.958 --> 53:33.252
Given the day I've had, I'm not sure if

53:33.293 --> 53:36.213
I trust my gut or what you're telling me.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.675
- The thing is that he's not the killer.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.051
He didn't do it, he's Santa.

53:41.093 --> 53:42.928
Yeah, he's Kris.

53:42.970 --> 53:46.014
Kris Kringle, you know, like, Santa Claus?

53:46.056 --> 53:47.850
- Ho, ho, ho!

53:47.891 --> 53:49.351
Santa Claus.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.562
- Anyway, the thing is we have to save

53:51.603 --> 53:54.022
the world from that monster out there!

53:54.064 --> 53:54.857
- The world?

53:54.898 --> 53:55.691
- Yes!

53:55.733 --> 53:56.900
Sean, do you trust me?

53:56.942 --> 53:58.235
- No!

53:58.277 --> 53:59.194
- Santa?

53:59.236 --> 54:00.028
- [Santa] Hmm?

54:00.070 --> 54:01.238
- Show him your thing.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.407
(zapping)

54:06.660 --> 54:07.453
- Holy shit.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.330
(laughs)

54:10.372 --> 54:11.248
Wow.

54:11.290 --> 54:12.374
(roaring)

54:12.416 --> 54:15.377
Gimme the fucking gun, give it here.

54:17.463 --> 54:18.756
What's it called?

54:18.797 --> 54:20.257
- [Santa] Krampus!

54:22.509 --> 54:24.178
(growling)

54:24.219 --> 54:27.181
(suspenseful music)

54:40.152 --> 54:42.029
- This is unbelievable.

54:44.490 --> 54:45.783
Let's say I do believe you.

54:47.785 --> 54:50.788
When I was a kid and you opened this place

54:50.829 --> 54:52.873
I really thought you were Santa.

54:52.915 --> 54:55.834
It was the onlV thing this
boring town had going for it.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.085
Christmas all year round.

54:58.253 --> 55:00.297
I thought I was the
luckiest kid in the world.

55:00.339 --> 55:01.882
- Well, goody fucking gum drops.

55:02.883 --> 55:03.842
I'm glad you had your fun.

55:03.884 --> 55:05.552
Here, have a cookie.
- Thank you.

55:05.594 --> 55:06.386
- But we don't have much time.

55:06.428 --> 55:08.680
You see, we gotta trap
him before midnight!

55:10.057 --> 55:12.059
- Yeah, no one knows this forest

55:12.100 --> 55:14.228
like I do, not even you, Kris.

55:14.269 --> 55:17.314
Let's get this Krampus
and take back Christmas!

55:17.356 --> 55:20.192
(dramatic music)

55:20.234 --> 55:22.986
- Okay, Dahlia, you're gonna be our eyes

55:23.028 --> 55:25.531
on the south end in car two
of the bumblebee coaster.

55:25.572 --> 55:26.365
- Got it!

55:28.408 --> 55:30.035
- Sadie, you have your compact?

55:30.077 --> 55:31.912
Great, Vou're gonna flash
it if you see anything.

55:31.954 --> 55:33.747
You're gonna be in the bumblebee hive.

55:35.791 --> 55:39.002
I'm gonna be perched right
here on top of the north tower.

55:42.422 --> 55:45.801
Sean, you'll be with me in the tower.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.427
- Your wish is my command.

55:47.469 --> 55:48.262
(gun clicking)

55:48.303 --> 55:49.096
Santa?
- Hmm?

55:49.137 --> 55:49.972
- You're gonna be at the house of mirrors

55:50.013 --> 55:51.765
and Vou are gonna have
your cane at the ready.

55:51.807 --> 55:53.100
- I'm there.

55:53.141 --> 55:56.144
(crunching)

55:56.186 --> 55:57.729
Yeah!
- Ha!

55:57.771 --> 56:00.691
(slapping)

56:00.732 --> 56:02.025
(yelling)

56:02.067 --> 56:05.028
- Santa Claus is coming to town, bitches!

56:06.071 --> 56:07.865
(dramatic music)

56:07.906 --> 56:09.199
- Okay.

56:09.241 --> 56:11.910
(camera clicking)

56:11.952 --> 56:13.537
Oh, no, it was blurry.

56:13.579 --> 56:16.123
(all groaning)

56:18.667 --> 56:21.670
(suspenseful music)

56:41.690 --> 56:43.901
(growling)

56:48.697 --> 56:51.575
(creaking)

56:51.617 --> 56:52.534
- Shit!

56:52.576 --> 56:55.370
I don't think it's working.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.622
What do we do now?

56:56.663 --> 56:57.956
- Good question.

57:04.796 --> 57:07.007
(growling)

57:13.847 --> 57:14.640
It's okay.

57:14.681 --> 57:16.016
- OkaV.
- It's just a noise.

57:16.058 --> 57:18.727
(moaning)

57:18.769 --> 57:20.979
(growling)

57:27.861 --> 57:29.154
(screaming)

57:29.196 --> 57:30.739
- OkaV.
- Come on!

57:30.781 --> 57:32.783
- Fuck you! (banging)

57:32.824 --> 57:33.617
Fuck you!

57:37.746 --> 57:38.538
Fuck you!

57:40.374 --> 57:44.670
CVelling)
(slicing)

57:47.422 --> 57:48.799
(screaming)

57:48.840 --> 57:53.136
- [Sadie] Hi-ya! (thudding)

57:53.178 --> 57:54.888
- [Santa] This way, Sadie!

57:54.930 --> 57:57.557
(roaring)

57:57.599 --> 57:58.684
(punching)

57:58.725 --> 57:59.851
- [Sean] Nice!

58:01.561 --> 58:02.604
Motherfucker!

58:04.356 --> 58:05.148
Come on!

58:06.149 --> 58:08.860
(dramatic music)

58:10.195 --> 58:11.780
Fucking asshole!

58:11.822 --> 58:14.116
(screaming)

58:23.709 --> 58:26.420
(engine revving)

58:32.509 --> 58:34.094
- Stop!

58:34.136 --> 58:35.262
- Cherry?

58:35.303 --> 58:36.513
- What the hell is she doing here?

58:36.555 --> 58:38.098
- Get those girls to safety.

58:39.599 --> 58:41.601
I'll take care of these guys.

58:43.895 --> 58:45.981
- Who the fuck called
the fucking bartender?

58:46.023 --> 58:47.607
- I got this.

58:47.649 --> 58:50.068
I am the wifey, after all.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.365
Ain't that right, honey?

58:55.407 --> 58:58.535
- Baby, I missed you so much.

58:59.411 --> 59:02.080
(engine revving)

59:02.122 --> 59:04.374
- How is she gonna capture Krampus?

59:04.416 --> 59:06.418
- Well, she's his crazy ex, right?

59:07.502 --> 59:09.004
That must make her Mrs. Claus!

59:10.172 --> 59:10.964
Come on!

59:12.591 --> 59:16.595
- Of all nights, you chose tonight

59:16.636 --> 59:19.306
to call in some bitches for fun?

59:19.347 --> 59:20.098
- No, no, no, no--

59:20.140 --> 59:22.142
- Big surprise!
- It's not what it looks like.

59:22.184 --> 59:24.144
- You whimpering fool!

59:24.186 --> 59:25.562
You failed me again!

59:27.355 --> 59:31.526
I alwaVs stuck bV Vou even
when your business failed

59:31.568 --> 59:32.861
and we had to eat the reindeer.

59:32.903 --> 59:35.155
Did I ever complain?

59:35.197 --> 59:35.989
- Never.

59:38.658 --> 59:42.996
- Don't you know what I've been up to?

59:43.038 --> 59:46.166
(laughing menacingly)

59:56.093 --> 59:58.804
(telephone ringing)

59:58.845 --> 01:00:00.722
- Margaret, he's just drunk.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.307
He's gonna be fine tomorrow, don't--

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:06.728
Look, Margaret, I gotta,
hang on a second I got--

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.313
Goddamn it!

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:09.606
No, not you, Margaret.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:11.817
Hold on.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:16.488
Green, this is the sheriff.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.366
Look, we haven't heard
from Sean in a while.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:20.450
He went out to Santa Land.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:22.577
I need Vou guVs to get out
there, I'm a little bit worried.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.162
Find out what the heck is going on.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:24.996
- [Green] Jesus Christ, Sean!

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.581
- Get out there right now.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.415
- [Green] Okay.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.750
- Good, thank you.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.460
(telephone ringing)

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:31.294
Jesus.

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:35.423
Margaret, hello?

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.299
(all panting and crying)

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.134
- [Sean] Come on!

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:43.640
- [Alexi] What is this place?

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:56.903
(door closing)
(gasping)

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:00.365

(ominous music)

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:08.707
- Krampus!

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:13.170
(chain rattling)

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.468
(zapping)

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.845
Cherry, what have you done?

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:28.185
- I was nobodV to Vou and
nobody to the entire world.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.854
You saw the way they portrayed me.

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:35.901
AlwaVs at Vour side with a
plate of cookies to serve you.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:36.735
Uh-uh-uh.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:43.116
I was portrayed as fat, ugly and old.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:49.122
When we both know that I am fucking hot!

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:55.045
I am cleansing the world of all

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:58.340
the little shits, naughty or nice!

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.174
And guess what?

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.008
- You can't do this!

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.303
- They'll all think it was you!

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.972
(ominous music)

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.479
- [Sadie] What's that noise?

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.481
- It's, uh, rats.

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:15.357
It's probably just rats.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.317
Big fucking rats or something.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:18.360
- Oh, my God, gross.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:22.530
- After everVthing we went
through rats are gross?

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:28.078
(thumping)

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:30.413

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:39.673
(ominous music)

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.427
- Why are you doing this?

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:48.682
- To rewrite historV mV
way with a little help

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:52.644
from my (snarling) hairy boyfriend.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.690

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:58.984

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:02.946
Oh, baby!

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:08.827
You were too busV spreading
love to the world.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:12.372
(Santa gagging)

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.876
Krampus, go get our sleigh.

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:21.423
We have work to do tonight.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.675

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.326

(gun firing)

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.635

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:41.146
Hurry!

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.731
She has my cane.

Sean, are you alright?

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.519
What happened?

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.607
