WEBVTT

00:02.176 --> 00:03.873
- Look, I'm sorry, sir.
He's not here.

00:03.916 --> 00:05.962
- I have the appointment card.
It says right here.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.572
- Sir, I understand you had
a scheduled appointment--

00:07.616 --> 00:10.227
- 8:00 on Tuesday.
- My manager isn't in yet.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.448
- Do you know
when he'll be here?

00:13.491 --> 00:15.276
- Sorry, but you're
welcome to wait.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.234
- That's why I made an
appointment in the first place.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.628
So I don't have to wait.
- I'm sorry.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.022
- Hey--
Uhh!

00:28.245 --> 00:30.291
- NYPD!

00:30.334 --> 00:33.250
Drop your weapons
and get on the ground now!

00:51.094 --> 00:53.183
Hit the alarm, now!

01:19.775 --> 01:23.126
- Did you talk to Jubal yet?
- No, I tried him a few times.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.346
- Look, I'm not against
the concept.

01:25.389 --> 01:26.825
- Then why are you making
such a big deal about it?

01:26.869 --> 01:29.306
- I'm not making
a big deal about it.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.701
I'm simply expressing
my lack of enthusiasm.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.181
- I forgot how exhausting

01:34.224 --> 01:35.747
you are.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.749
- Is that your way
of saying you miss me?

01:37.793 --> 01:41.013
I need to grab this.
Hey, Maggie, what's up?

01:41.057 --> 01:44.016
- Hey, Jubal, we got
a bank robbery, one dead.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.758
- Right, okay,
I'll touch base in five.

01:48.456 --> 01:52.242
- Let me guess, you have to go
light up the JOC?

01:52.286 --> 01:53.896
- I'll let you go then.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.420
- Yeah.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.901
- We'll see you
Saturday, right?

02:04.036 --> 02:08.824
- Did you see their faces?
- No, they were wearing masks.

02:08.867 --> 02:12.697
- What did they say to you?
- Nothing.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.351
Not a word.

02:15.787 --> 02:18.355
They just gave me
this note.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.188
- "PS 59, 3rd grade.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.625
All the cash in the safe,
no alarms."

02:27.669 --> 02:31.325
- PS 59?
- My son's school.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.938
I should have triggered
the alarm sooner.

02:35.981 --> 02:39.637
That poor officer,
I just--I just didn't know.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.552
- It's okay,
you did the right thing.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.815
They were threatening
your child.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.079
- Here you go, sir.
- It's okay.

02:52.911 --> 02:57.089
I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell.
This is my partner, OA Zidan.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.309
- Deputy Inspector
Richard Talmage.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.138
NYPD Major Case Squad.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.532
- We're very sorry.
- I appreciate it.

03:04.575 --> 03:08.884
Name's Oliver West.
Good man.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.452
Wife, two kids.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.151
Three other bystanders
were also shot.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.935
They're on their way
to the hospital now,

03:16.979 --> 03:19.851
but they appear to be in
stable condition, thank God.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.766
- Excuse me, can you
follow them to the hospital,

03:21.810 --> 03:23.725
see what they know?
- Yeah. Got it.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.422
- They pull the
security footage yet?

03:25.466 --> 03:27.598
- Yeah, we'll get it over
to 26 Fed right away.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.252
- Thank you.
- The teller said

03:29.296 --> 03:30.906
the robber
handed her this note.

03:30.949 --> 03:32.821
Ring any bells?
- Yeah, we had a few robberies

03:32.864 --> 03:34.997
in the area about a year ago.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.218
Same thing--silent criminals,
threatening notes.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.437
- You make an arrest?
- No, we were circling

03:40.481 --> 03:42.091
a robbery crew
on the Lower East Side,

03:42.134 --> 03:43.701
but we couldn't make the case.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.050
- Mind if we take a look
at those files?

03:45.094 --> 03:46.138
- Sure.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.186
Hey, I, uh...

03:50.230 --> 03:52.754
I know you guys are the lead
on bank robberies,

03:52.797 --> 03:55.670
but, uh...
- We understand.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.411
This one's personal.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.195
We'll keep you in the loop
every step of the way.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.414
- Thanks.

04:06.071 --> 04:08.857
- Bank robbery played out
like a silent movie.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.598
Robbers communicated
with notes.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.121
No words, no voices.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.515
Good news is,
NYPD has seen this before.

04:14.558 --> 04:15.951
M.O. matches a string

04:15.994 --> 04:17.866
of violent robberies
from last year.

04:17.909 --> 04:21.348
These are the lovely faces
of the various suspects.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.698
Let's dig deep,
see if we can't find a nexus

04:23.741 --> 04:26.091
to this bank robbery, huh?
- Security footage?

04:26.135 --> 04:27.745
- Uh, yeah, it came in
two minutes ago.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.181
Cue it up for me,
will you, Bill?

04:32.184 --> 04:34.186
All right, here we go.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.189
Perps walk in,
they knock the guard out,

04:37.233 --> 04:39.453
bang, a single shot in the air.
The shorter perp

04:39.496 --> 04:40.845
gives the note to the teller.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.152
- Officer West
identifies himself,

04:43.195 --> 04:46.895
gets shot...returns fire.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.027
All right, pause.
- Witnesses heard her scream,

04:49.071 --> 04:51.291
said it was definitely a woman.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.597
- Okay, I want you to start
calling all of the hospitals.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.904
I need the name
of every female gunshot victim

04:55.947 --> 04:58.036
in the Tri-State area.
All right, run it.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.829
Right there, stop.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.657
Can you blow that up
and run it again?

05:20.276 --> 05:22.017
Jubal.
- Yeah?

05:22.060 --> 05:23.627
- The taller perp takes the gun
from the female perp,

05:23.671 --> 05:25.412
doesn't even let her
take the shot herself.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.804
So either he's a better shot--

05:26.848 --> 05:29.154
- Unlikely, given
all the times he missed.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.766
- Or he's the boss.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.944
- Bad news is, Mr. Alpha didn't
get what he went there for--

05:35.987 --> 05:37.859
money.

05:37.902 --> 05:41.384
- Means he might
strike again, soon.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.304
- Striations in the bullets
are a match to the ones found

05:48.348 --> 05:50.393
at a home invasion
back in 2014.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.787
Same gun used in both crimes.
- You have a name?

05:52.830 --> 05:55.050
- Yeah, one of the guys in
the robbery crew got pinched.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.704
Did three years.
Matt Tolan.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.838
- Matthew Tolan was just
released from Rikers

06:00.882 --> 06:02.492
three weeks ago.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.669
- Didn't waste any time.
- We have a current address?

06:06.453 --> 06:07.845
- FBI!

06:07.889 --> 06:09.673
- Hey, whoa--
- Inside.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.153
- What the hell
is going on here?

06:11.196 --> 06:12.415
- FBI.
- We're looking for

06:12.459 --> 06:14.112
your brother,
Matthew Tolan.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.419
- You busted down my door
so you could look for Matt?

06:16.463 --> 06:18.334
- Where is he?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.857
- He's in the back.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.954
- Wake-up call, Matty.
- Oh...what the hell?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.956
What is this?
- You're coming with us.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.872
- Why?
What did, uh, what did I do?

06:34.916 --> 06:36.352
- There was a bank robbery
this morning,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
so we have some questions
to ask you.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.574
- Okay, fine, let's go.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.706
- I appreciate
the energy, Matt,

06:42.750 --> 06:45.970
but maybe you want to
put some pants on?

06:48.538 --> 06:50.627
- I keep telling you,
I didn't rob that bank.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.237
- I'd love to take
your word for it.

06:52.281 --> 06:55.589
- I was with my niece
at her school, PS 142.

06:55.632 --> 06:58.896
She had a violin concert.
- Can anyone verify that?

06:58.940 --> 07:02.770
- Plenty of people.
My sister, the teachers.

07:02.813 --> 07:05.990
I'm sure there's video, too.
- Oof, Uncle of the Year.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.166
Congrats.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.995
- Ooh, that coffee's
terrible.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.476
- Didn't realize you had
such refined tastes.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.260
But then again, when you've
spent as much time

07:15.304 --> 07:17.741
in prison as you have, I mean,
it makes perfect sense.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.351
- I'm not denying
that I made some mistakes.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.266
I'm just saying
your coffee sucks.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.355
- But you are denying that you
did the bank robbery, correct?

07:23.399 --> 07:25.445
- You're damn right.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.404
- Then how do you
explain the gun?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.275
- What gun?
- The one you used

07:30.319 --> 07:32.669
in that home invasion robbery
three years ago.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.802
It was used in
a bank robbery this morning.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.244
- It wasn't my gun.
- Whose was it?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.684
There's a dead
police officer, Matt.

07:49.730 --> 07:53.516
You sure you want to get
all mixed up in this?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.213
- Uh...

07:56.563 --> 07:58.913
His name's Patrick Cross.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.352
We, uh, we--we did
a few robberies together

08:03.395 --> 08:05.049
back in the day,
but that was a long time ago.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.443
I was a different person then.
- Where's Cross now?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.184
- Don't know.
Don't talk to him anymore.

08:09.227 --> 08:11.273
- Why not?
- Because he's the one

08:11.316 --> 08:13.841
who did that home invasion,
not me.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.414
- Okay, sit tight.
We're gonna run your alibi.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.374
- Oh and...I'll get the barista

08:25.417 --> 08:27.245
to make you
a fresh pot of coffee.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.726
- And we'll have 'em use one
of those artisanal blends too.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.815
- Oh, that's hilarious.
Thank you.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.296
- Yeah, well, I'm his father.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.124
I think this warrants
a conversation.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.734
Does that make sense?

08:37.778 --> 08:38.953
Okay, you know what?

08:38.996 --> 08:41.564
I can't talk about this
right now.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.000
Hey.
- Everything all right?

08:43.044 --> 08:45.263
- Oh, yeah, you know,
ex-wife, new boyfriend.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.178
This whole inclusive
modern family thing

08:47.222 --> 08:49.224
is not as awesome
as everyone makes it out to be.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.834
So did Tolan's alibi
check out?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.401
- Yeah, airtight.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.446
Five people saw him
at the school concert.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.798
- Okay, so Tolan is listening
to third graders play violin.

08:57.841 --> 09:00.365
What else? Where are we
with this Patrick Cross guy?

09:00.409 --> 09:02.063
- Last known address
isn't current

09:02.106 --> 09:03.630
and the landlord hasn't
heard from him in months.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.240
- Any leads
on the female suspect?

09:05.283 --> 09:07.372
- Not yet.
We're still calling hospitals,

09:07.416 --> 09:08.939
but so far no hits.

09:08.983 --> 09:11.246
- Let's expand that
to undertakers, funeral homes...

09:11.289 --> 09:13.204
doctor of choice
for many smart criminals.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.771
- What else do we know?

09:14.815 --> 09:17.121
- ERT is running various
blood samples from the bank,

09:17.165 --> 09:18.427
but it could take awhile.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.689
- Tell the lab
to make it a priority.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.561
I need it back today.
- Okay.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.998
- Yeah, yeah.
Guys, NYPD just got a report

09:24.041 --> 09:25.739
of a bodega robbery downtown.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.784
Two people in ski masks,
single shot in the air,

09:27.828 --> 09:29.917
no talking,
threatening note passed.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.745
- Looks like Bonnie and Clyde
struck again.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.311
- Let's get up
on every damn camera

09:33.355 --> 09:36.010
within a ten-block radius
of that bodega.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.413
- I've got guys
going up and down the block

09:48.457 --> 09:51.329
seeing if any other cameras
caught sight of 'em.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.208
- Do you have the note?

10:03.733 --> 10:05.692
"All the cash in the register.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.519
No alarms or we'll kill you."

10:07.563 --> 10:09.913
- Threat's not as specific.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.654
- No, it's spur of the moment.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.308
They're scrambling.

10:16.572 --> 10:19.357
They didn't
just take the cash either.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.407
You okay?

10:25.450 --> 10:26.669
- It could have been worse.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.366
- Do you know what they stole?

10:28.410 --> 10:30.020
- Everything that
they could get their hands on.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.806
Cash, gift cards, cell phones.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.286
- Cell phones?
- Yes, the prepaid kind.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.940
- We're gonna need
the serial numbers

10:36.984 --> 10:38.507
for every phone they took.
- Hey, one of my guys

10:38.550 --> 10:40.596
found a witness
who heard the female perp

10:40.640 --> 10:42.424
call the male perp Pat.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.950
- All right, people, we're
looking for Patrick Cross.

10:46.994 --> 10:50.693
34 years old, lifetime resident
of the Lower East Side.

10:50.737 --> 10:55.350
As you can see,
hardly an ideal upbringing.

10:55.393 --> 10:56.830
-  To say the least.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.396
Saw his father
murder his mother

10:58.440 --> 11:00.355
and his two sisters
when he was only ten.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.271
Trauma like that at that age

11:03.314 --> 11:05.752
chemically alters the brain.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.145
It skews emotional reactions
into adulthood.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.843
- Hmm.
- After the murders,

11:09.886 --> 11:12.280
his father went to prison
and Cross went into foster care.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.803
Bounced around
until he was about 16.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.239
- What happened at 16?

11:15.283 --> 11:16.937
- He moved in
with Matt Tolan's family.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.765
Before long, they were
committing armed robberies.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.289
- Files run pretty parallel
for the next 15 years.

11:21.332 --> 11:24.248
- Until Tolan went to prison
three years ago.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.946
- Haven't talked since.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.296
Tolan blames Cross
for the conviction.

11:28.339 --> 11:31.125
- Stolen burner is on.
I've got a rough location.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.214
- All right, Ian!

11:33.257 --> 11:35.433
So it looks like our suspects
are in the Lower East Side.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.521
They're heading west.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.827
- Jubal!
- Yeah.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.568
- NYPD's got
a reported car theft

11:39.611 --> 11:41.439
about a block away
from the bodega.

11:41.483 --> 11:44.268
CCTV also caught two suspects
matching our description.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.880
- All right, we're looking
for a silver Saturn, 2009,

11:46.923 --> 11:50.187
New York plates:
India, Tango, Alpha, 10, 15.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.712
Splash that out to everyone
we have on the streets.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.368
- All units be advised:
We have a silver Saturn

11:57.412 --> 11:59.806
weaving through traffic
near Delancey and Essex.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.764
- Delancey heading west.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.113
He's headed
for the Holland Tunnel.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.506
- Easy, Baby Driver.
Where are you going?

12:04.549 --> 12:06.116
- Short cut.
Get on the radio,

12:06.160 --> 12:08.553
see if NYPD can shut down
Delancey at Forsyth now.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.905
- Better than shutting down the
Holland Tunnel at lunch hour.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.518
- Suspects turning left
onto Broome, heading west.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.442
- Maggie, hold tight.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.798
You good?
- I don't know if good's

12:35.842 --> 12:37.974
the word,
but let's do this.

12:45.895 --> 12:46.983
- Let's go.

12:58.647 --> 12:59.822
- Come on!

13:01.215 --> 13:02.607
- Don't shoot.
There's too many pedestrians.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.740
- Get up! Get up!
Open the door.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.877
Stay down!
- He's taken a hostage.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.846
- There's two suspects inside.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.283
One male, one female.
- How many hostages?

13:26.327 --> 13:28.285
- We've seen four so far,
but there might be more.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.460
- Anyone injured?

13:29.504 --> 13:30.766
- There were
several shots fired.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.986
Didn't hit anyone.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.515
No pressure, Ian,
but you don't get eyes

13:40.558 --> 13:42.343
inside that restaurant,
you're fired.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.910
- Almost there.

13:43.953 --> 13:46.086
Restaurant's technology
is actually pretty good.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.870
- Meaning the cameras
are hard to hack?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.393
- Hard, but not impossible,

13:49.437 --> 13:52.048
and for the record,
I'm impervious to pressure.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.921
- Yes, and apparently sarcasm.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.838
- Ex-wife?

14:00.361 --> 14:02.189
- Yeah, yeah, it was actually.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.886
She's throwing a birthday party
for my kid.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.149
He's turning 12.
- What's wrong with that?

14:06.193 --> 14:08.891
- Well, she's doing it
at her new boyfriend's house.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.372
I'm not really down with that.
- So you're not gonna go?

14:12.677 --> 14:15.376
- Okay, we're in.
- All right, great work.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.117
Your job is safe for now.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.033
All right, people, we got eyes
inside the restaurant.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.904
Looks like there are--
five, six, seven.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.951
Seven hostages all seated
near the windows in front.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.562
- Hey, the female suspect,
she looks fine.

14:27.605 --> 14:28.824
She's not even limping anymore.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.999
- She got lucky?
Shallow wound?

14:30.043 --> 14:31.435
- Or she's really tough.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.046
- We get the blood results
back yet?

14:33.089 --> 14:34.961
- Uh, lab ran everything
we got back from the bank

14:35.004 --> 14:37.833
against the criminal database,
but no matches.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.096
Good news is our perps
aren't masked anymore.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.186
- Hey, Ian, can you get tight
screenshots of their faces?

14:47.060 --> 14:48.409
Well, we were right
about one thing.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.019
That's definitely
Patrick Cross.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.847
You recognize her?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.894
- No, but I'll run it through
facial recognition now.

14:59.028 --> 15:02.031
- Delta 2-1, tell me when
you're in position.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.513
- The windows in the back of
the building are small, but...

15:05.556 --> 15:06.775
- We have snipers in position

15:06.818 --> 15:08.211
on the rooftop
across the street.

15:08.255 --> 15:11.214
If we can get simultaneous
shots on both perps,

15:11.258 --> 15:13.434
we take 'em out.
- Dan, do our snipers

15:13.477 --> 15:15.088
have eyes on Cross?

15:15.131 --> 15:17.655
- Affirmative, they're trying
to line up shots now.

15:17.699 --> 15:18.874
- Okay, let me know
when you have

15:18.918 --> 15:20.615
both perps in the crosshairs.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.269
We do this simultaneously
or we don't do it at all.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.487
Am I clear?

15:23.531 --> 15:25.098
- Copy that.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.669
- Come on...

15:31.713 --> 15:33.280
That's right.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.804
Just take a look outside,
Patrick.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.071
- Gun six, do you have
target lock?

15:42.115 --> 15:43.855
- Affirmative.
Target locked.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.166
- Spotter, status update.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.734
- We have both suspects
in crosshairs.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.128
On your order, ma'am.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.479
- Maintain target lock.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.094
- Wait! I have something.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.316
- What's going on?
- The girl with Cross?

16:09.359 --> 16:10.795
It's Julia Parker.
She's 18.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.450
She went missing
eight months ago.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.586
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

16:18.629 --> 16:21.328
- Stand down.
I repeat, stand down.

16:21.371 --> 16:24.070
- Stand down, stand down.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.174
- Julia Parker.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.653
18-year-old
high school senior

16:42.697 --> 16:43.828
from Richfield, Connecticut.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.526
She went missing
eight months ago

16:45.569 --> 16:46.788
when she was on her way home
from soccer practice.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.572
- No ransom note.
No phone call.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.357
As far as I can tell,
there's no hard evidence

16:50.400 --> 16:52.446
she was kidnapped at all.

16:52.489 --> 16:55.188
- You saying she ran away?
- Unclear.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.841
Connecticut field office
has been working the case

16:56.885 --> 16:59.018
with local police.
No definitive conclusion yet,

16:59.061 --> 17:00.628
so we have to consider
the possibility

17:00.671 --> 17:02.064
that Julia is complicit
in all this.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.066
- We can take a look
through all the footage,

17:04.110 --> 17:06.590
see if we can glean any insight
into her current state of mind.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.288
- Good.

17:08.331 --> 17:11.421
But until we have evidence
to the contrary...

17:11.465 --> 17:13.902
we treat her like a victim.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.209
- Copy that.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.646
Hope NYPD feels the same.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.604
- What the hell is going on?

17:20.648 --> 17:22.563
Why are the snipers
standing down?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.521
- The female perp went missing
eight months ago,

17:24.565 --> 17:26.175
so before we move
we need to make sure

17:26.219 --> 17:27.611
that she's not being
held captive

17:27.655 --> 17:29.483
or if she's
a willing collaborator.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.225
- She just took seven people
hostage at gunpoint.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.618
Seems like
a willing collaborator to me.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.142
- I get that.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.795
We just need
a little more time here, okay?

17:37.839 --> 17:40.581
We need to make sure
we get this right.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.812
- This is outside
the restaurant

17:54.856 --> 17:56.075
right after the car chase

17:56.118 --> 17:58.077
and before any hostages
were taken.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.209
- Aah!

18:00.253 --> 18:01.645
- Come on!

18:01.689 --> 18:03.299
- You see that?

18:03.343 --> 18:05.693
Right there.
Their guns.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.390
All the muzzle flashes
came from him.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.957
She never fired.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.002
- Okay, maybe she's just
playing along

18:11.046 --> 18:13.483
in fear for her life.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.833
Keep going.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.535
- Okay, stop.

18:21.578 --> 18:22.884
Right there.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.190
Cross went inside
the restaurant

18:24.233 --> 18:25.539
and Julia could have
easily escaped,

18:25.582 --> 18:28.063
but she didn't.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.630
- Okay.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.458
Pull up the footage
from the two robberies.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.373
Let's see how involved
or uninvolved

18:33.416 --> 18:36.071
this young woman really is.
- Okay.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.160
- Has anyone notified
her family yet?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.727
- Uh, Jubal's in
the conference room

18:39.770 --> 18:41.772
with Julia's father now.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.341
- So she's alive?
You've seen her?

18:45.385 --> 18:47.604
- Yes, we've--we've seen her
on video.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.172
But, Dr. Parker, your daughter
was at the scene

18:50.216 --> 18:52.479
of two armed robberies
this morning.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.437
- "Armed robberies"?
- Yes.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.699
And right now
she's with a man

18:55.743 --> 18:58.441
and they've, uh...

18:58.485 --> 19:01.227
- They've--they've what?

19:01.270 --> 19:04.447
- Taken seven people hostage
at a local restaurant.

19:04.491 --> 19:07.015
Take a look.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.936
Someone must have...

19:14.979 --> 19:17.504
This man she's with
must have put her up to this.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.201
- It's--it's possible.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.335
We're still trying
to figure out her exact role.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.467
- Her exact role
is she was kidnapped.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.295
It's--it's as simple as that.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.167
- Have you ever heard
the name "Patrick Cross"?

19:28.210 --> 19:31.344
- No, is--is that who this is?
Patrick Cross?

19:31.387 --> 19:32.997
He--he's the one
that took my little girl?

19:33.041 --> 19:35.478
- He's the man that's with her.
We're just...

19:35.522 --> 19:38.220
not sure
if he kidnapped her.

19:40.657 --> 19:43.269
- What are you talking about?

19:43.312 --> 19:45.184
- Your daughter
had a blog, right?

19:45.227 --> 19:47.098
Current events,
pop culture?

19:47.142 --> 19:48.578
- Yeah, it was for school.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.711
- Well, it seems this man,
Patrick Cross,

19:50.754 --> 19:52.843
began to follow her
on her blog,

19:52.887 --> 19:53.975
her social media accounts.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.368
- So?

19:55.411 --> 19:57.935
- Some of that communication
was flirtatious.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.329
Photos, texts
sent back and forth.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.026
- She's a kid, for God sakes.

20:02.070 --> 20:05.247
You're blaming her for--
for sending a few stupid texts?

20:06.814 --> 20:09.295
This monster
took my little girl from me

20:09.338 --> 20:11.210
243 days ago,

20:11.253 --> 20:12.950
and you're saying
it's her fault?

20:12.994 --> 20:15.039
- Dr. Parker,
I want nothing more

20:15.083 --> 20:17.216
than to help you get your
little girl back, I promise.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.218
But right now we need
to figure out the nature

20:19.261 --> 20:21.611
of their relationship.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.178
Look, I have kids, too.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.788
We don't always know
what's going on with them.

20:24.832 --> 20:28.357
- Yeah, maybe you don't,
but I do.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.968
I'm a single father
with one child.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.928
I know Julia better
than anyone in this world.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.280
There's no way she ran off

20:38.324 --> 20:40.587
with some middle-aged guy.

20:40.630 --> 20:43.329
No way.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.767
- Okay.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.379
Well, we're doing
everything we can.

20:50.423 --> 20:53.252
I'm sorry I upset you.
I'm just doing my job.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.211
- Your job is to save her,
not criminalize her!

21:06.395 --> 21:07.918
- Let's open a line
of communication.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.007
You take point.
If Cross did abduct Julia,

21:10.051 --> 21:11.705
I'm guessing he has
some issues with women.

21:11.748 --> 21:14.055
There's no point
in triggering that now.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.931
- Who's this?

21:20.975 --> 21:23.499
- Agent Omar Zidan, FBI.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.764
Patrick, you there?

21:32.378 --> 21:35.555
Can you tell me
if Julia's okay?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.473
Her family's really worried.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.170
- I want an armored vehicle

21:42.213 --> 21:44.520
and a clear path
out of the city in one hour

21:44.564 --> 21:46.130
or everyone inside dies.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.873
- Lily, what the hell
just happened?

21:49.917 --> 21:51.179
- Son of a bitch
just shot someone.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.702
- No, his partner did.
- What?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.356
- Female captor just shot
one of the hostages.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.837
- Julia?

21:56.880 --> 21:59.318
- Quick, play it back.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.891
- Okay, guys, debate's over.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.807
Your so-called victim
just shot a damn hostage.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.505
Let's get those snipers
back in position.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.376
- No, hold on a second.
That guy rushed her

22:14.420 --> 22:16.509
and caught her off-guard.
That looked like self-defense.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.815
- What are you, her lawyer?

22:18.859 --> 22:20.426
- I don't think she's trying
to hurt people,

22:20.469 --> 22:21.949
and she could still be
a victim.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.646
- She just shot a guy,
for God's sake!

22:23.690 --> 22:25.039
It's time to move.

22:25.082 --> 22:28.564
Time to start saving
the real victims.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.523
Look, I don't want
to get into a turf war

22:30.566 --> 22:32.742
with the FBI,
but if I need to, I will.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.004
- Excuse me?

22:34.048 --> 22:35.397
- We've got one dead cop

22:35.441 --> 22:37.921
and seven New Yorkers
held captive.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.402
That gives the NYPD authority
to take action.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.969
- Richard--
- You've got ten minutes

22:42.012 --> 22:45.668
to get onboard,
or we're moving without you.

22:45.712 --> 22:49.280
- You move without my consent,
and I'll have your badge.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.118
- Kristen, NYPD's looking
to move in.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.556
Maggie's got them at bay,
but she is on pretty thin ice.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.122
- You got anything
to back up her theory

23:05.166 --> 23:06.254
that Julia's a victim?

23:06.297 --> 23:07.864
- Uh, well, nothing clear-cut,

23:07.908 --> 23:10.650
but there is something off
in the bank footage.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.129
Okay, you see here?

23:12.173 --> 23:14.567
Julia's walk, her stride,
her mannerisms

23:14.610 --> 23:17.396
is much different in this video
than that video.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.398
And she appears much shorter
in the bank

23:19.441 --> 23:20.486
than she does in the bodega.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.226
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.533
I mean, Patrick Cross is 5'10.
Julia Parker is 5'8.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.796
But in this video,
she looks shorter.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.842
Like, four inches, not two.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.539
- Could just be
the camera angle.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.454
- No, I don't think so.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.804
You see, a standard ATM
is 48 inches

23:34.848 --> 23:36.284
from the bottom
to the top button.

23:36.327 --> 23:39.330
The bank tiles, we know,
are 12x12,

23:39.374 --> 23:42.595
so by that scale,
we can measure this girl...

23:42.638 --> 23:45.293
and see that she is...

23:47.600 --> 23:49.036
5'5.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.516
Three inches shorter
than Julia Parker.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.561
- So that's why Julia
wasn't limping

23:52.605 --> 23:54.345
in the bodega
or the restaurant.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.697
- Because the girl who got shot
in the bank isn't Julia.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.228
- Hey, Jubal.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.490
- The woman who got shot
at the bank, it's not Julia.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.231
- What?
Who is it?

24:10.274 --> 24:11.841
- We ran the blood splatter
from the bank

24:11.885 --> 24:13.364
against the
missing person's database.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.844
Matched to a girl
named Katharine James.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.672
15 years old,
abducted ten months ago

24:16.716 --> 24:18.848
from her family's apartment
on the Upper West Side.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.502
- Jubal.
- Yeah.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.852
- The wrists.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.550
- Yeah, we got visual evidence

24:24.593 --> 24:26.073
that both these young women
have been restrained.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.336
Significant abrasions
around their wrists.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.946
- So when they're not
accompanying Cross

24:29.990 --> 24:32.427
in the robberies,
they're being held captive?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.298
- Yeah.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.910
- Where's Katharine James now?
- Yeah, how do we find her?

24:36.953 --> 24:39.129
- No, Jubal,
how do we save her?

24:39.173 --> 24:41.349
She's been shot.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.394
- Bank was held up
at 8:09 a.m.

24:43.438 --> 24:46.354
Bodega robbery was reported
at 9:27 a.m.,

24:46.397 --> 24:48.443
so somewhere in between the two

24:48.487 --> 24:50.532
Patrick Cross dropped off
Katharine James

24:50.576 --> 24:52.447
and picked up Julia Parker.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.623
- They showed up at both crimes
on foot 78 minutes apart.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.146
He couldn't have covered
that much ground.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.409
Dig up traffic reports,
CCTV footage,

24:58.453 --> 25:00.107
reported sightings,
any data you can find,

25:00.150 --> 25:01.761
and build a radius
of everywhere

25:01.804 --> 25:03.197
Cross could have gone
between the two attacks.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.851
- How much time do I have?

25:04.894 --> 25:06.417
- Maggie and OA are working
to hold off

25:06.461 --> 25:07.984
a very emotional NYPD.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.899
- Is that your way
of saying "not much"?

25:09.943 --> 25:13.163
- That's my way
of saying "five minutes."

25:15.339 --> 25:16.689
- Now there are two victims?

25:16.732 --> 25:18.255
What the hell
are you talking about?

25:18.299 --> 25:19.822
- The girl inside the bank
is not the same

25:19.866 --> 25:21.824
as the one inside
the bodega or this restaurant.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.478
- It's not a hunch,
it's a fact.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.262
- Both girls have severe
abrasions on their wrists.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.960
They're being restrained.

25:27.003 --> 25:29.353
- They're being held captive.

25:29.397 --> 25:30.920
- I got it.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.575
Cross is our only target.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.577
So let's take his ass out
and call it a day.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.145
- Not until we find out
where the second victim is.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.538
We take Cross out now,

25:39.581 --> 25:41.452
there's a chance
we never find Katharine.

25:41.496 --> 25:44.499
- Not to mention she got shot,
so she might be bleeding out.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.109
- I get it, but we got a man
inside the restaurant

25:46.153 --> 25:48.851
who's bleeding out, too.

25:48.895 --> 25:52.072
- Okay, we gotta get
Cross talking.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.552
So maybe we do have
to make a trade.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.857
We have
to give him something

25:54.901 --> 25:56.511
in exchange
for Katharine's whereabouts.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.991
- It's worth a try,
but it's pretty obvious

25:58.034 --> 25:59.732
he doesn't want
to engage with us.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.255
- Well, we have to find someone
who he will engage with.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.952
- You'd better find them fast,

26:02.996 --> 26:04.824
because this thing's
about ready to blow up.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.739
Literally.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.699
- The hell is this guy doing?

26:10.743 --> 26:12.701
- He is making sure
we can't send SWAT in.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.399
We throw a flash-bang,
whole place goes up in flames.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.227
- Or he wants to set
the damn place on fire,

26:17.271 --> 26:19.969
create a distraction
so he can escape.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.237
Ask me, it's better
to lose one life than seven.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.980
- No, we're gonna
save them all.

26:31.024 --> 26:34.593
We just need
to get Cross talking.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.116
- Who does Patrick Cross
love?

26:36.159 --> 26:37.683
Who does he respect,
who does he like?

26:37.726 --> 26:39.249
Who does he listen to?

26:39.293 --> 26:40.729
Does he have a priest,
a shaman, a friend?

26:40.773 --> 26:42.731
- It looks like he's a loner.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.690
- Well, there has
to be someone.

26:44.733 --> 26:47.344
- Well, his mother
and his two sisters are dead.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.651
He grew up in foster care,
and to the extent

26:49.695 --> 26:52.088
that he has any cousins,
aunts, uncles,

26:52.132 --> 26:54.351
they're obviously
not very close.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.832
- And he'd despise them
for not taking care of him

26:56.876 --> 26:58.791
when he was young
and needed a family.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.271
- No ex-girlfriends,
ex-wives.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.839
- At least he has that
going for him.

27:03.883 --> 27:06.581
Did I say that out loud?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.670
- Him.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.457
- You sure about that?

27:13.501 --> 27:15.677
- No, but worth a shot.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.767
Family's family.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.858
- Joseph Cross,
Agent OA Zidan.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.425
We spoke on the phone.
You ready?

27:24.468 --> 27:26.079
- Yeah, just tell me
what you need me to say--

27:26.122 --> 27:28.211
but I want that 2 grand
in my prisoner account

27:28.255 --> 27:30.387
by the end of the day.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.048
- Hello?

27:39.092 --> 27:40.571
- Patrick, it's Omar.
FBI.

27:40.615 --> 27:41.834
- I don't want
to talk to you.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.705
- That's fine,
but I have someone here

27:43.749 --> 27:44.880
that wants to say hello.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.490
- Who?

27:46.534 --> 27:49.755
- Patrick, hey.
It's me, your father.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.497
The FBI told me
what's happening.

27:53.541 --> 27:54.977
- And what?

27:55.021 --> 27:56.370
You came here
to give me advice?

27:56.413 --> 27:57.763
Was that a joke?

27:57.806 --> 27:59.547
- Look, I get it.

27:59.590 --> 28:02.202
I got no right
telling anyone what to do,

28:02.245 --> 28:05.074
but I--I figured
I might as well try.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.076
They say no one's dead yet.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.774
That means there's still
a way out.

28:08.817 --> 28:11.515
I mean,
you do what they ask...

28:11.559 --> 28:14.823
you could still have
a life someday.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.086
But you gotta call off

28:17.130 --> 28:19.393
this hostage thing, now.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.702
Patty, you there?

28:25.486 --> 28:27.314
- Ask him about
Katharine James.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.576
Tell him we'll give him
a car or a plane

28:28.619 --> 28:30.883
if he tells us where she is.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.406
- Hey, Patty.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.713
Do you know anything
about a girl named, uh,

28:34.756 --> 28:37.193
Katharine James?

28:42.590 --> 28:45.375
Hey, Patty, you still there?

28:47.595 --> 28:49.249
-  Damn.

28:52.861 --> 28:55.342
- Jubal, we scanned through
social media posts.

28:55.385 --> 28:56.778
We went through
anything geotagged

28:56.822 --> 28:58.171
near the bank or the bodega.

28:58.214 --> 28:59.389
- And you found something?

28:59.433 --> 29:01.261
- Tourists caught
our bank robbers

29:01.304 --> 29:03.611
in the background of a photo
taken near the Tenement Museum

29:03.654 --> 29:05.308
at 8:49 a.m.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.310
So we pulled CCTV footage
from the area

29:07.354 --> 29:11.053
and followed them
through the area...

29:11.097 --> 29:13.012
to these two blocks.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.274
- And what happened there?

29:14.317 --> 29:16.015
- Well, we hit a dead zone,

29:16.058 --> 29:18.539
but they'd been walking
at about 3.6 miles an hour,

29:18.582 --> 29:20.280
and at that rate
they should have

29:20.323 --> 29:22.761
hit choke points
at these three cameras

29:22.804 --> 29:25.372
at one of these times.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.331
- What?
They disappeared?

29:28.375 --> 29:30.812
- No, they turned up...

29:30.856 --> 29:33.075
here, approximately
four minutes later

29:33.119 --> 29:35.730
than they should have
and walking at the same speed.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.340
So either they got lost--
- Or they stopped off

29:37.384 --> 29:38.820
somewhere
between those two cameras.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.735
- Exactly.
Katharine James

29:40.779 --> 29:42.215
is somewhere
in these two blocks.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.826
I just don't know where.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.176
- But we have someone
who might.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.917
- I'm sorry,
I haven't seen that kid

29:48.961 --> 29:50.397
in 25 years.
- I know.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.442
You did what you could.
- Hey, Joseph!

29:52.486 --> 29:53.922
Excuse me.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.794
We think that your son
may have been staying

29:55.837 --> 29:57.708
somewhere in this area.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.146
Anything look familiar?

30:00.189 --> 30:03.627
- We lived in an apartment
on that block a long time ago.

30:03.671 --> 30:06.282
Years before I...

30:09.546 --> 30:11.548
- What was the exact address?

30:16.858 --> 30:19.208
- Both bedrooms clear!

30:19.252 --> 30:20.731
- Right, clear!

30:20.775 --> 30:24.083
- Stairs.
Stack on me.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.041
Breacher over here.
- Sir.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.695
- Upstairs clear!

30:29.479 --> 30:31.394
- Go, go, go, go!

30:51.371 --> 30:54.026
- Can you tell me your name?

30:54.069 --> 30:56.158
- Katharine.

30:58.117 --> 31:01.076
- You're safe now, Katharine.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.165
I've got you.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.648
Get a paramedic in here.
- Yes, sir.

31:07.691 --> 31:10.390
- Let me get those cuffs
off you.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.656
You're gonna be okay now.

31:21.053 --> 31:24.056
- No, no way Julia
is a part of this.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.884
She's not a criminal.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.929
She hates Patrick
just like me.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.670
- Why didn't she escape?
We have video.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.280
There are moments
she could have run.

31:31.324 --> 31:33.195
Plus, she has a gun.
Why not just shoot the animal?

31:33.239 --> 31:35.937
- Because she was
protecting me.

31:35.981 --> 31:39.071
He ties us up.
He blindfolds us.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.551
We never knew where we were.

31:41.595 --> 31:44.032
If Julia shot Patrick,

31:44.076 --> 31:46.948
she would never find me.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.950
He told us every day,

31:48.994 --> 31:51.953
"You run, the other one dies."

31:51.997 --> 31:56.871
Whatever Julia has done,
she did it to protect me.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.873
We're family.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.570
We had a pact.

32:00.614 --> 32:03.095
We always go back
for the other.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.053
No matter what.

32:10.841 --> 32:13.366
- Did Julia make that for you?

32:13.409 --> 32:15.846
- Yeah.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.979
She has one, too.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.851
We call them
"sister bracelets."

32:29.991 --> 32:31.862
- Patrick.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.998
That's okay, you don't need
to talk to me.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.739
But I'm gonna talk to you,
so listen up.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.567
The hostage inside
the restaurant,

32:40.610 --> 32:43.004
he is going to die
if we do not get him some help.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.485
You don't want that,
trust me.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.356
He dies, it's game over.
Nothing we can do.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.576
No car, no money, no plane.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.796
- I'm not letting anyone out.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.059
- You don't have to,

32:54.102 --> 32:55.321
but we're gonna
send somebody in.

32:55.364 --> 32:57.714
An EMT.

33:02.241 --> 33:05.113
- Okay, send him in.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.314
Okay.

33:32.358 --> 33:33.837
Go ahead.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.536
You help the guy who got shot,
that's it.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.930
You talk to anyone else,
you die.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.730
- Okay, let's see.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.039
You're gonna be okay.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.214
- I'm just gonna
clean the wound

34:02.257 --> 34:04.738
and put some compression on it.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.762
Okay, this is gonna help
with the pain.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.946
- Are you done?

34:38.989 --> 34:40.034
- No.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.992
No, I think he has a fever,

34:42.036 --> 34:44.952
and I'm concerned that
he might have an infection.

34:46.519 --> 34:49.348
Look, can--can I just get
some water from the bar?

34:54.135 --> 34:55.832
- Be quick.

34:55.876 --> 34:59.271
And keep your mouth shut.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.099
Julia, over here.

35:01.142 --> 35:03.101
Now.

35:07.844 --> 35:10.978
I don't want you
talking anymore.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.154
You understand me?

35:16.201 --> 35:17.419
Go.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.742
- Oh, my God.
Look, he's burning up.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.135
Can--can you just

35:37.178 --> 35:40.399
get your partner
to help me get some ice?

35:40.442 --> 35:42.314
- No, no.
He looks good.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.750
It's time for you
to get out of here.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.317
- No, he's not okay.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.622
His temperature
is way too high.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.015
I just need some ice.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.974
I'll get him to cool off
and then I'll go.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.629
Please.

35:58.808 --> 36:00.593
-  Go.

36:01.681 --> 36:04.205
- Okay, you need to take this.

36:17.566 --> 36:18.828
- Look down, now!

36:18.872 --> 36:21.135
Face forward!

36:25.618 --> 36:27.533
- She's alive?
She's okay?

36:27.576 --> 36:30.188
- She's safe.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.711
- What are you...

36:33.060 --> 36:35.062
Who's alive?

36:36.759 --> 36:38.326
What the hell is going on?
- I just was--

36:38.370 --> 36:39.893
- I said no talking!
- Okay, I just was saying

36:39.936 --> 36:41.721
that he--he was gonna be okay.

36:41.764 --> 36:44.985
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.247
- You a cop?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.249
- No.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.150
- He's gone.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.375
It's okay.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.595
Give me the gun.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.074
You're okay.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.685
You're safe now.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.733
Is...

37:37.777 --> 37:40.345
- It's okay.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.695
- It's okay.

37:53.619 --> 37:55.708
- It's okay.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.582
- Julia!

38:05.065 --> 38:07.720
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

38:14.988 --> 38:15.989
- Are you okay?

38:23.083 --> 38:26.173
- They were held captive
together for eight months.

38:26.216 --> 38:29.829
What can I possibly
say to her?

38:29.872 --> 38:32.266
- Doesn't matter
what you say.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.573
Just matters
that you're here.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.010
- You're okay.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.141
- Dad?

38:38.185 --> 38:40.274
- Honey.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.584
- It's okay.
It's okay.

38:45.627 --> 38:48.326
- Oh, honey--
- Mom!

38:51.851 --> 38:54.723
I'm so sorry.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.247
I love you, Dad.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.308
- Okay, thank you.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.179
Hey.
Just got off the phone

39:16.223 --> 39:18.356
with the hospital.
Julia's in stable condition.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.227
No injuries,
no physical trauma.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.099
- No physical trauma?

39:23.143 --> 39:26.059
- No. Katharine, too.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.669
- So then Cross didn't--

39:27.713 --> 39:29.454
- Both girls were examined
very closely.

39:29.497 --> 39:32.544
No sign of sexual
or physical abuse.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.287
Hey, Dana.
- Yeah.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.464
- So Cross abducts
these two young girls,

39:39.507 --> 39:41.944
doesn't beat them,
doesn't rape them.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.340
What is he looking for?

39:46.384 --> 39:49.430
- Family.
We all need one.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.025
- Jubal.
- Allan.

40:19.068 --> 40:20.156
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.115
- I'm glad you could make it.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.117
- You kidding me?
It's my kid's birthday.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.162
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
