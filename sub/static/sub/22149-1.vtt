- Is this good?
- No.

00:55.220 --> 00:57.787
- Sorry. Lower?
- Yeah, yes.

00:57.789 --> 01:00.390
- Good, good.
- Okay.

01:00.392 --> 01:02.458
This is awesome.

01:04.796 --> 01:07.363
- You can come if you want to.
- Okay, I'm about to.

01:07.365 --> 01:08.532
- Good.
- Are you gonna come?

01:08.534 --> 01:10.170
Eh...

01:11.804 --> 01:14.338
- Did you hear that?
- Huh?

01:14.340 --> 01:16.740
Like a woodland creature
pitter patter?

01:16.742 --> 01:19.642
Okay, the plan is to have
sex in the woods.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.311
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Are you okay?

01:21.313 --> 01:23.213
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

01:23.215 --> 01:24.847
Because I kind of feel like
maybe you're not into it.

01:24.849 --> 01:26.517
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, my God.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.520
- I fell. I'm sorry. A bug.
- What is it?

01:29.522 --> 01:31.255
- Sorry.
- Okay.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.856
A spider.

01:33.858 --> 01:36.392
I'm sorry.

01:36.394 --> 01:37.860
No, it's okay. It's cool.

01:37.862 --> 01:39.695
I'm not a woodland person.

01:39.697 --> 01:41.698
Okay.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.534
Do you want me
to help you finish or...

01:43.536 --> 01:45.234
No, I... my parents.

01:45.236 --> 01:46.770
- Okay.
- Let's get in the car.

01:46.772 --> 01:49.472
Lights, trash, door.

01:49.474 --> 01:50.874
Traffic's gonna be
a nightmare.

01:50.876 --> 01:52.545
Bye, house,
see you next summer.

01:53.945 --> 01:55.645
What did you put
in these bags?

01:55.647 --> 01:56.847
I have no idea.

01:56.849 --> 01:58.382
It's like dead bodies.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.517
Here and here.
Up front, please.

02:00.519 --> 02:02.451
Pat, can I help
with anything?

02:02.453 --> 02:05.454
Ali, Ali, Ali, no.
No, no, no!

02:05.456 --> 02:07.223
- No.
- I rode bitch here.

02:07.225 --> 02:08.524
- Okay
- Okay?

02:08.526 --> 02:09.792
No, and you can
ride it back.

02:09.794 --> 02:11.828
- I don't want to.
- Well...

02:11.830 --> 02:13.466
Guys, I can sit

- What?

02:32.585 --> 02:33.917
"Bring."

02:33.919 --> 02:36.252
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

02:36.254 --> 02:38.655
"Break me a higher love"
like...

02:38.657 --> 02:40.489
Like you... like you
have to break me

02:40.491 --> 02:42.893
if you want me to love
like on such a high plain.

02:42.895 --> 02:44.428
Alan, is it bring or break?

02:44.430 --> 02:46.262
Ben's right, sweetie.

02:47.532 --> 02:49.465
Ali, I revised
the Michigan app.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.602
So do you want to talk through
the comments with me or...

02:51.604 --> 02:54.270
Not really because
I don't want to go there.

02:54.272 --> 02:56.572
Honey, you need to cast
a wide net.

02:56.574 --> 02:58.841
Yeah, I'm sorry my future
is so stressful for you,

02:58.843 --> 03:00.310
but I'm not applying there.

03:00.312 --> 03:02.245
I didn't say
it was stressful.

03:02.247 --> 03:03.679
Guys, you really need
to get a grip, okay?

03:03.681 --> 03:04.982
Because Ali doesn't want
to go anywhere

03:04.984 --> 03:06.583
unless everybody wears berets

03:06.585 --> 03:07.984
and all they all smoke
clove cigarettes

03:07.986 --> 03:09.453
and they all make
their own hummus

03:09.455 --> 03:10.821
but they eat it
out of Frisbees.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.788
I can see
your boyfriend's come stain.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.490
- Ali!
- Shut up!

03:14.492 --> 03:15.491
God.

03:15.493 --> 03:16.827
It's her fiancée.

03:16.829 --> 03:17.928
You can see
her fiancée's come stain.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.495
God, it smells like

03:19.497 --> 03:20.864
a K.D. Lang concert
down there.

03:20.866 --> 03:22.798
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Fuck you.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.568
- Shut up!
- Take a chill pill, please?

03:25.570 --> 03:27.336
Fuck you!

03:27.338 --> 03:28.839
It's not new for me
to be able to say swears.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.941
- Slow down, sweetie.
- Hey, guys, relax.

03:47.558 --> 03:49.525
<i>Have yourself a dental dam.</i>

03:49.527 --> 03:51.360
<i>But, of course, I'm going
to be using this later</i>

03:51.362 --> 03:54.064
<i>so I don't want
to ruin this later.</i>

03:54.066 --> 03:57.000
Suck my dick.

03:57.002 --> 04:01.537
Kim Deal's my hero.
Whatever.

04:02.974 --> 04:05.508
School starts
in eight hours.

04:05.510 --> 04:07.477
Okay, give me seven seconds.

04:07.479 --> 04:08.811
It's after midnight.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.380
I'm getting off.

04:10.382 --> 04:12.082
Good night, Jed.

04:12.084 --> 04:13.917
No, I think she has
a crush on you.

04:13.919 --> 04:15.719
Ali.

04:15.721 --> 04:17.790
Okay, good night.

04:20.526 --> 04:23.627
Jed speaks.
What was he saying?

04:23.629 --> 04:25.762
I don't know.
Butt stuff.

04:25.764 --> 04:29.602
Oh, I love you, good night.

04:32.870 --> 04:35.005
Love you.

04:48.821 --> 04:49.885
Thank you.

04:49.887 --> 04:50.887
This is for you.

04:50.889 --> 04:52.923
Great belt.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.858
Oh, I think
I'm getting a rash.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.728
You got to stop
touching that.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.896
So, is this guy you're seeing,
is this the...

04:59.898 --> 05:01.697
What do you call it?

05:01.699 --> 05:03.132
Smash slam poetry?

05:03.134 --> 05:05.368
Ew, no, no.
No, I broke up with him.

05:05.370 --> 05:08.572
No, this guy
is a performance artist.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.440
- Oh.
- Major upgrade.

05:10.442 --> 05:11.974
We ended up drinking
on his roof

05:11.976 --> 05:13.709
and having one of those
epic conversations

05:13.711 --> 05:16.012
until the sun comes up,
you know the kind?

05:16.014 --> 05:21.050
Ben and I spent
three hours at Blockbuster.

05:21.052 --> 05:25.087
And, uh, we got "Curly Sue."

05:25.089 --> 05:26.957
Sexual.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.625
It's a good film.

05:29.627 --> 05:31.762
In fact, it's really funny.

That's all I have.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.933
That was the best song ever.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.103
Do you have
any perfume?

06:13.105 --> 06:15.471
My mom's like
a drug-sniffing dog.

06:15.473 --> 06:17.507
Perfume. I don't think
dudes wear...

06:17.509 --> 06:18.942
Like, some of that
man spray.

06:18.944 --> 06:21.610
- This stuff.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

06:21.612 --> 06:23.980
- Here we go.
- Okay. Spray me.

06:23.982 --> 06:25.748
Oh, okay. Right.

06:27.586 --> 06:28.819
Whoa, that's a lot.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.656
I didn't want a lot.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.024
Hi.

06:35.026 --> 06:38.060
Hey, there.

06:38.062 --> 06:40.098
- Oh.
- Floor, please.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.202
What is that?
You got schmutz all over here.

06:46.204 --> 06:48.070
What is that?

06:48.072 --> 06:50.539
Did you parallel park yet?

06:50.541 --> 06:51.841
I'm very good at it,

06:51.843 --> 06:53.642
so it should be
a cinch for you.

06:53.644 --> 06:55.110
Smells good.

06:55.112 --> 06:57.680
Don't get too excited.
It's leftovers.

06:59.517 --> 07:01.151
You know, when kids
in my class wore shoes like this

07:01.153 --> 07:02.719
it meant they had polio.

07:02.721 --> 07:04.086
Yes, they do look
a little corrective.

07:04.088 --> 07:05.921
What did you do today?

07:05.923 --> 07:08.190
- Crack.
- You know what I did?

07:08.192 --> 07:11.260
I wrote beautiful copy
for fake Oreos.

07:11.262 --> 07:14.831
Anyone for a Yum Yum?

07:14.833 --> 07:16.533
Aw, yeah.

07:16.535 --> 07:18.168
Honey, that stuff
will give you cancer.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.702
Guess what?

07:19.704 --> 07:22.072
George offered to host a reading

07:22.074 --> 07:23.707
of my play at his house.

07:23.709 --> 07:24.974
That's great, honey.

07:24.976 --> 07:26.610
Plenty of booze, no food,

07:26.612 --> 07:28.043
a bunch of self-righteous
Upper West Siders.

07:28.045 --> 07:30.779
Hey, has anyone spoken
to Dana this week?

07:30.781 --> 07:32.082
There is a sale at Kleinfeld's.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.084
Did they pick a date?

07:34.086 --> 07:35.284
Because I bet
it's my birthday.

07:35.286 --> 07:37.086
No, not yet.

07:37.088 --> 07:38.687
I was hoping the dress
would sort of get her excited.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.524
So you'll come
to the reading then?

07:40.526 --> 07:41.957
I don't know,
are you inviting me?

07:41.959 --> 07:43.260
I want the whole family.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.262
You, Ali, me, Ben, and...

07:45.264 --> 07:47.096
you know, what's her face,
the one with the D.

07:47.098 --> 07:49.533
- Yes, Dana.
- Douchebag.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.700
Her name is not douchebag.

07:51.702 --> 07:53.937
That's too German.
Douchebag.

07:53.939 --> 07:55.137
Dana Douchebag.

07:59.144 --> 08:00.276
Okay, switch.

08:00.278 --> 08:03.146
Okay, I need to wash.

08:03.148 --> 08:05.315
Okay, hold on.
Wait a second.

08:05.317 --> 08:06.882
- What?
- What is that?

08:06.884 --> 08:08.218
- What?
- Right there, that rash.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.719
Oh my God. Come on!

08:10.721 --> 08:13.022
Sorry, sorry.
It's on your arm too.

08:13.024 --> 08:15.625
Oh, I've been itching
all week.

08:16.928 --> 08:18.562
I think you might
have poison ivy.

08:18.564 --> 08:21.031
What?

08:21.033 --> 08:23.197
- Excuse me.
- What?

08:23.199 --> 08:24.868
How did I get poison ivy?

08:24.870 --> 08:27.236
- That was a joint decision.
- You gave me poison ivy.

08:27.238 --> 08:29.038
It's probably
in my vagina.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.106
You want me to look?

08:30.108 --> 08:31.875
No! Geez.

08:31.877 --> 08:34.208
Oh, I should probably
pee on you.

08:36.181 --> 08:38.315
That move is for jellyfish.
I'm not stupid.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.049
No, it's for poison ivy too.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.184
I think it is.

08:42.187 --> 08:45.589
You want to pee on me?

08:45.591 --> 08:46.956
Here we go, here we go.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.959
- No! We just have...
- Shh!

08:48.961 --> 08:50.893
- Are you doing it?
- Just quiet down.

08:50.895 --> 08:52.829
- All right, do it, do it.
- I can't pee on command.

08:52.831 --> 08:54.363
Do it before I change my mind.
Do it, do it.

08:54.365 --> 08:56.900
- Listen, okay, there it is.
- Oh my God.

08:56.902 --> 08:59.201
- You want me to stop.
- No.

08:59.203 --> 09:01.070
- No?
- I like it.

09:03.642 --> 09:04.940
He was touring
with the Grateful Dead

09:04.942 --> 09:06.743
for, like, many months.

09:06.745 --> 09:08.310
So I don't even know
what this place is or...

09:08.312 --> 09:09.979
He wasn't touring.
He was following them.

09:09.981 --> 09:11.915
He probably has lice.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.882
Making grilled cheese
sandwiches in the parking lot.

09:16.221 --> 09:18.021
- Hey, Ravi!
- Oh my God.

09:18.023 --> 09:19.321
Oh my God. Look at you.

09:19.323 --> 09:20.723
Look at me?
Look at you.

09:20.725 --> 09:22.124
You're back. Aw.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.893
Embrace me, brother.
Embrace me.

09:24.895 --> 09:25.895
You get a head hug too.

09:25.897 --> 09:27.229
Hi, I'm Ben.

09:27.231 --> 09:29.034
What's your... what's your name?

09:30.668 --> 09:34.036
This is... this is Table.

09:34.038 --> 09:36.105
Table?

09:36.107 --> 09:39.809
Off the bat,
she's taken a vow of silence.

09:39.811 --> 09:41.011
- Oh, okay. That makes sense.
- Wow.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.177
Just in time for the party.

09:42.179 --> 09:43.379
Dude, we got to catch up.

09:43.381 --> 09:44.748
Yeah, yeah, let's catch up.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.915
- You good?
- Yeah.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.217
- Okay.
- She's so good.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.818
- Hurry.
- Okay.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.185
- Let's go, let's go.
- Benjamin.

09:50.187 --> 09:52.088
- Look at this.
- Benjamin.

09:52.090 --> 09:55.025
Guys, make room
for Table as well.

10:05.903 --> 10:09.204
Did you see
what Ravi's new look is?

10:09.206 --> 10:12.342
I think he sews it himself.

10:12.344 --> 10:14.209
Can you imagine the Ravi
we knew in college...

10:14.211 --> 10:15.811
Yeah. It's different.

10:15.813 --> 10:17.180
Looking into the future
and seeing this?

10:17.182 --> 10:19.815
I know.
Well, I guess it's...

10:19.817 --> 10:23.686
the influence of, you know,
Mrs. Table, yeah.

10:23.688 --> 10:26.122
He's soon to be, Mr. Table.

10:26.124 --> 10:29.124
- Yeah. Hey, good for him.
- It's really sweet.

10:29.126 --> 10:30.727
I'm still looking
for my Table.

10:30.729 --> 10:32.462
I really am though.

10:32.464 --> 10:34.430
This girl
I was just with

10:34.432 --> 10:36.232
showed up to a date
wearing a ski mask.

10:36.234 --> 10:38.133
Serious.

10:38.135 --> 10:40.402
She said she wanted
to know my personality

10:40.404 --> 10:42.906
before I knew her face.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.842
Was she...
a normal person?

10:45.844 --> 10:47.209
She was kind of
a mean drunk.

10:51.750 --> 10:55.118
I'm really happy to see that
you never kicked your snort.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.453
I don't want
to talk about it.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.421
This one made it
on a foot loom.

10:59.423 --> 11:01.491
It was slamming.

11:01.493 --> 11:03.792
She made all of them.

11:03.794 --> 11:07.132
Dowels, we made
like a thousand dowels.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.800
What is that?

11:11.802 --> 11:15.104
It's an engagement ring.

11:15.106 --> 11:18.074
You finally did it.

11:20.177 --> 11:23.081
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

12:24.341 --> 12:25.845
Come with me.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.445
I'm going to go
with Sophie.

12:30.447 --> 12:31.783
That's so whack.

12:33.818 --> 12:35.386
It will help me study.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.824
That's not coke.

12:41.826 --> 12:44.459
I know, it's H.

12:44.461 --> 12:46.831
Holy shit.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.900
Are we really just going
to do this right now?

12:50.902 --> 12:52.068
I did it with Danny
last week.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.906
It's really not scary.

12:55.573 --> 12:57.473
It's like climbing
back into the womb.

12:57.475 --> 13:00.209
You won't even have
to do that much.

13:06.551 --> 13:10.486
Call my mom
if I die.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.268
What?

14:53.357 --> 14:56.561
What the fuck?

15:07.639 --> 15:10.973
Holy fuck, Dad.

15:23.620 --> 15:26.689
<i>In celebration
of the contributions</i>

15:26.691 --> 15:28.324
<i>women make in every aspect...</i>

15:28.326 --> 15:30.059
Ah, gotcha.

15:30.061 --> 15:32.027
Doesn't that hurt?

15:32.029 --> 15:35.031
This from the guy who's
gonna row over his own balls.

15:35.033 --> 15:38.066
<i>As mothers, wives, sisters,
daughters...</i>

15:38.068 --> 15:39.469
Wow, I love that suit.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.436
Traffic is gonna
be a nightmare.

15:41.438 --> 15:43.205
We better leave soon.

15:43.207 --> 15:45.174
I thought we were
going to talk to Ali?

15:45.176 --> 15:46.776
Can we talk tonight?

15:46.778 --> 15:48.344
She's not going clubbing
in the middle of the day.

15:48.346 --> 15:50.246
She went out again
last night.

15:50.248 --> 15:51.647
I saw her pile of clothes
when I took out the trash.

15:51.649 --> 15:53.416
Detective Pat.

15:53.418 --> 15:56.352
God forbid she'd dislike you
for five seconds.

15:56.354 --> 15:59.454
This is not me leaving you
to be bad cop, all right?

15:59.456 --> 16:01.757
Bad cop.
I'm barely a crossing guard.

16:01.759 --> 16:04.227
All right, I really
will talk to her tonight.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.494
I promise.

16:05.496 --> 16:07.162
What do you think?

16:07.164 --> 16:08.664
Two weeks no phone?

16:08.666 --> 16:10.233
And that includes Jed.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.068
You know the boy's name.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.339
- Uh-huh.
- Hmm.

16:15.273 --> 16:17.073
No.

16:17.075 --> 16:19.108
What are you, a mime?

16:19.110 --> 16:20.709
Yes, I studied in France.

16:20.711 --> 16:23.478
Actually, I'm a crossing guard,

16:23.480 --> 16:26.049
and you can't pass
without paying the toll.

16:33.057 --> 16:35.724
<i>We may help bring
new dignity and respect...</i>

16:35.726 --> 16:38.694
That is a nice suit.

16:38.696 --> 16:40.331
You up?

16:48.706 --> 16:50.839
Bullshit.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.291
<i>McCann Erickson?</i>

17:09.294 --> 17:10.526
Mr. Jacobs, please?

17:10.528 --> 17:12.361
<i>May I ask who's calling?</i>

17:12.363 --> 17:14.830
Tell him it's C.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.498
<i>Please hold.</i>

17:16.500 --> 17:18.336
Yeah, I'll hold.

17:26.510 --> 17:28.310
We all know
what we're breathing.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.379
Whether or not he knows
that it's the same air

17:30.381 --> 17:32.180
that jackass Giuliani
is breathing.

17:33.617 --> 17:34.784
He's pouring all his money

17:34.786 --> 17:35.852
into the police department.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.586
Meanwhile, the rest of us

17:37.588 --> 17:40.389
need to fight for
a different kind of enforcement.

17:40.391 --> 17:41.891
Pat?

17:41.893 --> 17:44.727
Solid Waste Disposal reforms
is pushing to 3 p.m.

17:44.729 --> 17:46.362
- Okay.
- Grannis is on line two.

17:46.364 --> 17:47.697
And Congressman Hinchey
just called

17:47.699 --> 17:49.132
about the cement plants again.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.432
Okay.

17:50.434 --> 17:52.602
Also, Iris
from Dalton called.

17:52.604 --> 17:55.738
Alexandra hasn't
signed in yet.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.173
Uh, Alexandra
has the flu.

17:58.175 --> 18:01.544
Again? Try ginseng.

18:01.546 --> 18:03.746
I don't know that is.
I'll take Grannis now.

18:05.849 --> 18:08.653
Thanks. Bye.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.842
<i>You have four messages.</i>

18:32.844 --> 18:34.709
<i>Dana, it's Laura.</i>

18:34.711 --> 18:36.645
<i>You haven't gotten back to me
about book club.</i>

18:36.647 --> 18:37.846
<i>You said you were
bringing the mahjong tiles.</i>

18:37.848 --> 18:39.248
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

18:39.250 --> 18:41.316
<i>I'm going to be home late.</i>

18:41.318 --> 18:42.785
<i>I'm having some drinks
with some work peeps tonight.</i>

18:42.787 --> 18:44.187
<i>Can you grab
some toilet paper?</i>

18:45.823 --> 18:47.556
<i>Hi, this message
is for Dana Jacobs.</i>

18:47.558 --> 18:49.624
<i>This is Samuel
from the Water Club.</i>

18:49.626 --> 18:51.193
<i>If you're still interested
in having your wedding here,</i>

18:51.195 --> 18:52.327
<i>please call me back at...</i>

18:52.329 --> 18:54.263
<i>Hi, Dana, it's Mom.</i>

18:54.265 --> 18:55.797
<i>There is a sale at Kleinfeld's
this weekend.</i>

18:55.799 --> 18:57.903
Ugh!

19:09.513 --> 19:11.747
Hi, this is Dana calling.

19:11.749 --> 19:13.481
I just wanted to relay
a message to Kim and David

19:13.483 --> 19:14.917
that I'm not going to be able

19:14.919 --> 19:16.485
to make the staffing meeting
today.

19:16.487 --> 19:20.389
I've eaten something wrong.

19:20.391 --> 19:22.824
At lunch, and I just feel like
I need to be near

19:22.826 --> 19:24.395
my own restroom.

19:26.497 --> 19:28.200
Dana Jacobs.

19:29.400 --> 19:33.803
I do our layout.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.537
Yeah.

20:43.540 --> 20:46.074
Oh, no.

20:48.378 --> 20:49.778
Whatever.

20:49.780 --> 20:50.946
It's okay.

20:50.948 --> 20:51.980
Your secret's safe with me.

20:51.982 --> 20:53.382
I won't tell anyone

20:53.384 --> 20:55.017
you dance to world music.

20:55.019 --> 20:56.751
I'm not ashamed.

20:56.753 --> 20:59.921
I think it's good
to like music from our world.

21:02.926 --> 21:05.628
Sorry, you had
a little hairball.

21:07.765 --> 21:09.899
Where's, um...

21:09.901 --> 21:11.600
Uh?

21:11.602 --> 21:13.602
- Ben?
- Ben, where's Ben?

21:13.604 --> 21:15.673
He's at work.

21:17.974 --> 21:20.609
What? Can nobody hang out
alone anymore?

21:20.611 --> 21:21.977
I feel deeply alone
at all times.

21:21.979 --> 21:23.345
I say accept it.

21:23.347 --> 21:24.447
This is my first day alone

21:24.449 --> 21:25.914
since, I don't know, 1982,

21:25.916 --> 21:28.784
and I am really digging in.

21:28.786 --> 21:30.952
First, I'm doing this,
and then I'm gonna skip dinner.

21:30.954 --> 21:32.354
I'm going to go
to Serendipity,

21:32.356 --> 21:33.555
get a frozen hot chocolate,

21:33.557 --> 21:35.091
eat it all by myself
and then...

21:35.093 --> 21:36.561
Want to get a bite to eat?

21:38.128 --> 21:40.528
With you?

21:51.709 --> 21:54.977
Oh. You just had that
on hand?

21:54.979 --> 21:57.712
It's cool.

21:57.714 --> 21:59.114
The cops raided this place
last night.

21:59.116 --> 22:00.882
So we're safe tonight.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.718
Oh, you know what,
I have a job to get to.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.689
I'm kidding.
Jesus, sit down and smoke this.

22:06.691 --> 22:08.894
It's on fire.

22:15.599 --> 22:17.866
So, do you have
any more tales

22:17.868 --> 22:19.168
from the dating front?

22:19.170 --> 22:20.669
Uh, last week a girl

22:20.671 --> 22:21.937
asked if she could strangle me.

22:23.407 --> 22:25.173
Well done.

22:25.175 --> 22:26.609
Don't look over here. Oh!

22:26.611 --> 22:28.744
I think you got
the musician.

22:28.746 --> 22:30.578
I would say
we'd get kicked out,

22:30.580 --> 22:31.980
but nobody here cares
about anything.

22:33.683 --> 22:36.751
Yeah, you know...

22:36.753 --> 22:40.088
All I really want
is a nice Jewish Italian girl

22:40.090 --> 22:42.924
who just wants
to sit on the couch with me.

22:42.926 --> 22:45.661
Watch "Mad About You."

22:47.164 --> 22:49.064
Yeah, well, Helen Hunt
has really perfected

22:49.066 --> 22:51.100
the frontal wedgie.

22:51.102 --> 22:53.536
So, tune in for that.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.471
I wonder where
Helen's vagina is.

22:56.473 --> 22:57.840
Just kidding.

22:57.842 --> 23:01.209
We can all see it
in prime time.

23:01.211 --> 23:03.946
Yeah.

23:03.948 --> 23:05.613
How about you and Ben?

23:05.615 --> 23:09.584
You guys watch a lot
of Must-See TV together?

23:09.586 --> 23:12.153
Yeah.

23:12.155 --> 23:14.890
Sounds really nice.

23:14.892 --> 23:17.793
Oh, save it.
You don't have to say that.

23:17.795 --> 23:19.765
I'm being serious.

23:21.598 --> 23:23.164
Yeah, it's nice.
It's very good.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.866
It's good. We... you know.

23:24.868 --> 23:26.634
It's very totally good.

23:26.636 --> 23:28.671
We just brush our teeth,
and we take our clothes off,

23:28.673 --> 23:30.104
and we get into bed,

23:30.106 --> 23:33.042
and, if he reaches
for the candle,

23:33.044 --> 23:36.111
I know that we're going
to have sex to the 11:00 movie.

23:36.113 --> 23:37.613
That's really rude.

23:37.615 --> 23:39.113
That's not even what I mean.

23:39.115 --> 23:42.183
That's a real asshole remark
to make, Dana.

23:45.556 --> 23:47.756
They really got
the heater on in here, right?

23:48.925 --> 23:50.926
Oh my goodness.

23:52.963 --> 23:54.497
How you feeling?

23:54.499 --> 23:57.099
Mmm, mmm.

23:57.101 --> 23:58.500
Mellowing out a little?

24:02.006 --> 24:04.806
You know, I think that
the last we got stoned together

24:04.808 --> 24:08.113
was... in your dorm room.

24:09.946 --> 24:12.014
I remember that, I think.

24:12.016 --> 24:13.082
Yeah?

24:13.084 --> 24:15.116
Yeah.

24:15.118 --> 24:18.953
We had a four-hour
conversation about dinosaurs.

24:21.125 --> 24:24.593
And I then I think
some clothes came off.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.543
So fun.
I should go home.

24:39.977 --> 24:41.911
- Yeah, okay.
- Whoa.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.077
You okay?

24:43.079 --> 24:45.713
Yeah.

24:45.715 --> 24:46.715
I should get a cab.

24:46.717 --> 24:47.886
Okay, go ahead.

24:58.796 --> 25:00.499
Shit.

25:15.112 --> 25:17.947
Uh, oh my God.

25:21.852 --> 25:23.585
<i>You came from Second City,
didn't you?</i>

25:23.587 --> 25:25.955
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- <i>Were you in the main company?</i>

25:25.957 --> 25:27.859
- <i>Main stage.</i>
- Hey.

25:29.226 --> 25:30.959
I have to pee so bad.

25:30.961 --> 25:33.261
I'm reading
Hammacher Schlemmer.

25:33.263 --> 25:36.632
They're advertising
the world's fastest razor blade.

25:36.634 --> 25:40.869
There's an inversion machine
and a lot of luggage.

25:40.871 --> 25:42.837
- Babe?
- Hmm?

25:44.141 --> 25:45.373
Are you okay?

25:45.375 --> 25:47.308
I'm going to the bathroom.

25:47.310 --> 25:51.145
No fucking way.
KGB surveillance binoculars?

25:51.147 --> 25:53.584
What the fuck?

25:55.286 --> 25:57.251
Kitten Toe!

25:57.253 --> 25:58.988
You can buy as many
as you want.

25:58.990 --> 26:02.357
You can hook 'em up
to form a kitten village.

26:02.359 --> 26:05.294
You can build
your own kitten village.

26:05.296 --> 26:07.962
Babe, there's some his and hers
trench coats in here.

26:07.964 --> 26:10.164
It says that they're packable.

26:10.166 --> 26:11.866
I don't know what's different
about that

26:11.868 --> 26:13.001
than regular trench coats,

26:13.003 --> 26:15.336
but whatever.

26:15.338 --> 26:18.172
She we go stone
or pale putty?

26:18.174 --> 26:20.008
Pale putty.

26:20.010 --> 26:22.911
This is fucking awesome.

26:22.913 --> 26:24.214
Oh, my God.

26:51.241 --> 26:52.676
Incoming.

26:59.450 --> 27:02.220
Looks like Chernobyl in here.

27:06.990 --> 27:08.289
Mm-hmm.

27:08.291 --> 27:09.927
Mmm.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.330
So you want to tell me why
I'm getting calls from school

27:15.332 --> 27:17.132
asking where you are?

27:17.134 --> 27:19.735
Or should I tell you
what I think I know?

27:19.737 --> 27:21.370
- Cool choices.
- Hey.

27:21.372 --> 27:23.271
You tell us you did well
on the Vonnegut essay.

27:23.273 --> 27:25.306
Meanwhile, I see you got an 83.

27:25.308 --> 27:26.874
- You went through my stuff?
- Didn't go through your stuff.

27:26.876 --> 27:28.276
It was on your desk.

27:28.278 --> 27:30.011
Well, what's an 83,
like, like a B?

27:30.013 --> 27:31.447
Yeah!

27:31.449 --> 27:33.716
God, it's a good grade.
You freak.

27:33.718 --> 27:36.117
Your mom is trying to say
that you're smarter than a B.

27:36.119 --> 27:38.120
But dumb enough
to leave enough clubbing clothes

27:38.122 --> 27:39.388
in the stairwell.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.055
Not entirely your fault.

27:41.057 --> 27:43.292
We did take you
to Studio 54 in utero.

27:45.128 --> 27:48.430
You want to tell her
about the Quaaludes?

27:48.432 --> 27:50.199
Okay. You got me.

27:50.201 --> 27:52.366
I got a B,
and I have a life.

27:52.368 --> 27:54.737
You're real fucking detectives.

27:54.739 --> 27:56.337
Don't you fucking
detective me.

27:56.339 --> 27:57.940
- You wanna know what I think?
- No.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.440
I think we should
just let her get a B.

27:59.442 --> 28:02.878
Let her sneak out.
Hopefully, she'll get mugged.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.846
Most people learn
from failure.

28:04.848 --> 28:08.049
Wow. Well, you would know.

28:08.051 --> 28:09.687
You're the king.

28:11.489 --> 28:12.888
No wonder he hates you.

28:12.890 --> 28:15.026
- What?
- Excuse me?

28:17.193 --> 28:20.027
You're reckless.

28:20.029 --> 28:22.029
And grounded.

28:22.031 --> 28:24.165
Both of you
are so fucked!

28:24.167 --> 28:26.034
Stop cursing!

28:26.036 --> 28:27.870
Just stop it for once, Ali.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.141
Just get out!

28:39.316 --> 28:41.048
Should of just done it myself.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.854
I was alone in there
anyway.

28:46.356 --> 28:49.324
Hey.

28:49.326 --> 28:52.795
There's a 6:44.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.162
Just meet me there now.

29:27.998 --> 29:31.165
Great, she's going out
to get mugged.

29:31.167 --> 29:36.071
No one's getting mugged.

29:36.073 --> 29:39.106
She's too scary.

29:57.228 --> 29:58.496
You have to be
really quiet, okay.

30:08.204 --> 30:10.140
Oh, fuck.

30:12.442 --> 30:13.877
Uh!

30:27.590 --> 30:29.557
Did you bring condoms
this time?

30:29.559 --> 30:32.126
Yeah, should I get 'em now?

30:32.128 --> 30:33.865
Yeah.

30:43.539 --> 30:45.943
Should I put it on now?

31:08.265 --> 31:10.431
Is the CD skipping?

31:10.433 --> 31:12.167
I don't think so.

31:12.169 --> 31:14.036
Dude, it's totally skipping.

31:15.405 --> 31:17.407
Oh, are you fucking
kidding me?

31:20.711 --> 31:22.180
That's embarrassing.

31:27.151 --> 31:28.486
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

31:37.161 --> 31:40.899
<i>Mind you have work to do.</i>

31:43.000 --> 31:45.334
You hear that?

31:47.403 --> 31:48.538
It's probably a bear.

31:52.041 --> 31:54.308
Probably a bear?

31:54.310 --> 31:56.143
You're such a city kid.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.346
There's a bear outside?

31:58.348 --> 32:01.315
They can't open doors,
can they?

32:01.317 --> 32:03.084
How do you know that?

32:06.022 --> 32:08.422
All right.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.394
- Ah!
- Ah! Ah!

32:13.396 --> 32:16.064
Dana! Dana!

32:18.102 --> 32:20.334
- What are you doing here?
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?

32:20.336 --> 32:22.269
I asked you first.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.038
I'm Jed.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.507
Okay.

32:25.509 --> 32:27.508
Can you not tell Mom
I'm here, please?

32:27.510 --> 32:29.478
No, obviously I'm going
to tell Mom that you were here.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.413
God, you're like
a tattle-tail. You bitch!

32:32.415 --> 32:34.248
Actually, I'm an adult

32:34.250 --> 32:36.351
who was coming for a quiet
weekend in the country

32:36.353 --> 32:38.386
and found her home invaded,

32:38.388 --> 32:40.654
and, yeah, I'm gonna tell mom
that you were here

32:40.656 --> 32:41.722
in your underwear.

32:41.724 --> 32:44.258
With...

32:44.260 --> 32:47.094
- Jed.
- Jed.

32:48.499 --> 32:50.399
And both of you
need to leave right now.

32:50.401 --> 32:53.567
No! What... you leave.
We were here first.

32:53.569 --> 32:56.071
You are such an irritant!

32:56.073 --> 32:57.506
You're a little piece
of toilet paper

32:57.508 --> 32:59.373
that gets stuck
to somebody's shoe.

32:59.375 --> 33:02.744
You're like the embodiment
of constipation, okay.

33:02.746 --> 33:05.113
Okay.

33:05.115 --> 33:06.715
All right, great.

33:06.717 --> 33:08.616
You can stay. Fine.

33:08.618 --> 33:10.384
But he needs to leave.

33:10.386 --> 33:12.487
And you can take him
to the train station

33:12.489 --> 33:14.456
because you have
your learner's permit.

33:14.458 --> 33:17.191
No, I can't because I need
a parent to be in the car.

33:17.193 --> 33:21.496
Oh, please stop
Frenching in front of me.

33:21.498 --> 33:24.231
Stop Frenching
in front of me.

33:25.769 --> 33:27.438
Why don't you
just come back with me?

33:30.140 --> 33:32.140
I think my sister might be
having a nervous breakdown.

33:35.278 --> 33:37.746
I need to make sure
she doesn't tell my mom.

33:42.586 --> 33:46.121
Is your drug store underwear
that deep up your ass?

33:47.458 --> 33:49.356
What?

33:49.358 --> 33:51.561
See you later.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.083
Is he your boyfriend?

34:14.818 --> 34:16.585
Not really.

34:18.255 --> 34:21.255
Do you guys have sex?

34:21.257 --> 34:22.489
Yeah.

34:22.492 --> 34:25.226
Oh.

34:26.630 --> 34:29.331
So, Mom has no idea
where you are?

34:29.333 --> 34:31.601
Does Ben know
where you are?

34:32.869 --> 34:35.302
Well, that's different

34:35.304 --> 34:38.539
because Ben is not
my mom.

34:38.541 --> 34:41.376
I'm here because
I needed to get away,

34:41.378 --> 34:44.311
and you're a child.

34:44.313 --> 34:47.349
You know, and you ran away
from home, and that's...

34:47.351 --> 34:49.251
I did not run away
from home.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.554
I went to our family's
country house.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.559
How much more vanilla
can that scenario get?

35:00.429 --> 35:04.566
Look at us
having sister time.

35:04.568 --> 35:07.438
Are you going to, like,
try and braid my hair later?

35:09.672 --> 35:11.505
Do you want
to go swimming?

35:23.219 --> 35:26.354
This is the best sports drink
I've ever had.

35:26.356 --> 35:28.456
That's because
it's Whiskey Mountain Dew.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.925
It's because it's what?

35:29.927 --> 35:31.659
It's Whiskey Mountain Dew.

35:34.398 --> 35:35.729
Whoo! Hoo!

35:38.235 --> 35:40.202
Did I do that?

35:40.204 --> 35:41.769
Three Mississippi, four.

35:41.771 --> 35:44.371
You think you could ever
be a synchronized swimmer?

35:44.373 --> 35:45.609
Do everything
that I do.

35:51.547 --> 35:53.748
I could definitely do this.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.450
Can you do that?

35:55.452 --> 35:57.519
Can you not, please?

35:57.521 --> 35:58.987
Big splash. Stop!

36:02.358 --> 36:04.626
Ow! Stop! Stop!

36:04.628 --> 36:09.264
Ow, God!
What's your problem?

36:09.266 --> 36:11.499
Why do you play so rough?

36:11.501 --> 36:13.334
God, calm down.

36:13.336 --> 36:15.369
Seriously, why do you have
to go so hard at everything?

36:15.371 --> 36:16.804
You ruin everything.

36:16.806 --> 36:19.407
Fuck you, cunt.

36:19.409 --> 36:21.909
Sorry.

36:21.911 --> 36:23.778
Ali!

36:25.481 --> 36:27.849
Ali.

36:29.585 --> 36:30.784
Ali!

36:30.786 --> 36:32.354
Stop!

36:32.356 --> 36:35.824
Stop!
I don't like horse play.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.358
I don't like pranks.
I don't like this.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.795
I don't like it.

36:43.934 --> 36:45.469
Dad's having an affair.

36:51.708 --> 36:54.409
Oh, my God.

36:54.411 --> 36:55.677
Yeah, wait till
you get to April.

36:55.679 --> 36:57.746
He had a haiku phase.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.546
Why does he sometimes
refer to himself

36:59.548 --> 37:02.416
as "her Pillsbury Dough Boy"?

37:02.418 --> 37:04.619
Oh, it's because
he calls his dick "dough."

37:04.621 --> 37:07.655
- Oh, Jesus. God.
- Yeah.

37:07.657 --> 37:09.557
Just broke my brain.

37:09.559 --> 37:12.459
Fucking... I hate him.
Okay, I hate him.

37:12.461 --> 37:14.396
- You don't hate him.
- I do though.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.731
- You don't.
- Why should I not?

37:16.733 --> 37:18.733
I don't think that...

37:18.735 --> 37:20.302
we should say anything to Mom

37:20.304 --> 37:22.336
until we know what this is.

37:22.338 --> 37:24.472
If I were Mom,
I would chop off that dough

37:24.474 --> 37:26.508
Loretta Bobbitt style.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.909
It's not... it's Lorena.

37:28.911 --> 37:31.345
I got a strong feeling that
he's in love with someone else.

37:31.347 --> 37:33.847
She cut off an entire penis.
You should say her name right.

37:33.849 --> 37:35.684
I can tell that
he's in love with someone else.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.584
I think she threw it
out a window as well.

37:37.586 --> 37:39.554
And he doesn't even
have to be fucking her.

37:39.556 --> 37:42.423
What's going on is that he's
emotionally cheating on Mom.

37:42.425 --> 37:43.925
You watch way too much Oprah.

37:43.927 --> 37:45.927
"Emotionally cheating."

37:45.929 --> 37:48.429
And maybe it's just
a fantasy,

37:48.431 --> 37:49.831
which...

37:49.833 --> 37:52.434
to be honest
is totally healthy.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.436
It's just, you know,
a totally healthy thing

37:54.438 --> 37:58.440
to have... to have fantasies.

38:17.626 --> 38:19.661
♪ Do, do-do-do ♪

38:19.663 --> 38:21.829
- Look what I found.
- Oh, my God.

38:21.831 --> 38:23.898
In mother's wardrobe.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.599
Looks so good!

38:25.601 --> 38:28.001
Wow!

38:32.708 --> 38:34.311
I have something to say.

38:36.045 --> 38:40.548
I have something
that I feel that...

38:40.550 --> 38:43.485
if I don't share it...

38:43.487 --> 38:46.387
it will stay inside of me

38:46.389 --> 38:48.856
and start to eat me alive.

38:48.858 --> 38:50.090
Please, say it.

38:57.666 --> 39:01.469
I slept with somebody,
and it is not Ben.

39:01.471 --> 39:02.704
- Ow.
- What?

39:02.706 --> 39:04.838
- I know, I know.
- Whoa.

39:04.840 --> 39:08.876
- I really... liked it.
- Oh.

39:08.878 --> 39:12.579
My body, like,
really responds.

39:12.581 --> 39:14.449
Ugh.

39:16.485 --> 39:18.753
We're just like
a family of cheaters.

39:18.755 --> 39:20.421
I just have to get it out.

39:20.423 --> 39:22.055
I just have to say
"I'm Dana,

39:22.057 --> 39:24.626
"and I'm a cheater,

39:24.628 --> 39:26.026
and I'm a Mountain Dew drinker."

39:26.028 --> 39:27.729
Yeah, and you're
a come guzzler.

39:27.731 --> 39:30.697
Sold.

39:30.699 --> 39:32.166
Okay.

39:32.168 --> 39:34.836
Thanks for telling me.

39:34.838 --> 39:39.541
I just think maybe
this is a sign

39:39.543 --> 39:41.876
that there's somebody else
that I'm supposed to be,

39:41.878 --> 39:44.512
that it's trying
to get out of me.

39:44.514 --> 39:47.514
Okay, yeah. Okay.

39:47.516 --> 39:49.483
What's her name?

39:52.456 --> 39:57.191
Ba... delia.

39:57.193 --> 39:58.892
Badelia?

39:58.894 --> 40:00.628
And I'll tell you what.

40:00.630 --> 40:02.697
Badelia's very fun to be.

40:02.699 --> 40:04.898
A lot of people
don't get to be Badelia.

40:04.900 --> 40:07.668
Badelia is
a little bit wicked.

40:07.670 --> 40:09.103
- Uh-huh.
- She's wild.

40:09.105 --> 40:10.737
She makes her own choices.

40:10.739 --> 40:13.907
And Badelia has secrets,

40:13.909 --> 40:17.144
and secrets can be rather fun.

40:17.146 --> 40:19.112
You know what else?

40:19.114 --> 40:21.081
- Double triple lunge!
- Oh!

40:21.083 --> 40:23.818
Mikhail Baryshnikov.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.188
I like dancing.

40:27.190 --> 40:28.490
I don't think I've ever

40:28.492 --> 40:29.923
danced with you before.

40:29.925 --> 40:30.992
It's really nice to hear you

40:30.994 --> 40:32.092
say yes instead of no.

40:32.094 --> 40:33.528
No!

40:34.931 --> 40:39.633
Anyone home?

40:39.635 --> 40:41.838
Mom?

40:46.643 --> 40:47.909
- Mom?
- Mom?

40:47.911 --> 40:51.112
- Oh, Jesus.
- Sorry.

40:51.114 --> 40:53.280
I love you.

40:53.282 --> 40:56.985
I love you.

40:56.987 --> 41:00.255
And I love you too.
What's going on here?

41:00.257 --> 41:03.557
I love you.
I just wanted you to know.

41:03.559 --> 41:05.559
And I love everything you do.

41:05.561 --> 41:06.994
Busting dust.

41:06.996 --> 41:08.229
Where's Dad?

41:08.231 --> 41:11.666
He's at his writing workshop.

41:11.668 --> 41:13.635
I called Sophie's mom.

41:13.637 --> 41:17.037
Do you want to tell me
where you really were?

41:17.039 --> 41:18.972
Oh, she was at my place.

41:18.974 --> 41:20.807
Ali!

41:20.809 --> 41:22.776
Sorry I scared you.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.679
What is that? Laundry?

41:25.681 --> 41:28.883
Oh, I was actually
hoping to crash here

41:28.885 --> 41:30.851
for a few days,
if that's possible.

41:30.853 --> 41:32.186
If you have room.

41:32.188 --> 41:33.987
Is everything okay?

41:33.989 --> 41:35.158
Yeah.

41:37.159 --> 41:38.693
What about you?

41:38.695 --> 41:39.961
How long do you
plan on staying?

41:39.963 --> 41:41.628
Uh, until I'm 40.

41:41.630 --> 41:44.634
All right, that works for me.

41:49.338 --> 41:52.974
Thanks for bringing
this stuff.

41:52.976 --> 41:56.144
I'm just so surprised.

41:56.146 --> 41:58.246
Are you okay?

41:58.248 --> 42:00.648
Yeah, I'm fine.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.950
It's just crazy.

42:02.952 --> 42:05.653
Your dad doesn't seem like
the type to have a mistress.

42:05.655 --> 42:08.289
He seems like...
don't take this the wrong way...

42:08.291 --> 42:11.191
but, like, too pussy to cheat.

42:11.193 --> 42:14.162
What did you say?

42:14.164 --> 42:16.998
What?

42:17.000 --> 42:18.365
What?

42:18.367 --> 42:19.833
- Say "pussy" again.
- Oh my God.

42:19.835 --> 42:21.802
- Say it.
- Umm...

42:21.804 --> 42:25.072
Aren't you supposed
to be at work right now?

42:25.074 --> 42:26.641
I called in sick.

42:26.643 --> 42:28.876
This is nice.

42:28.878 --> 42:30.677
You can bite me
if you want.

42:30.679 --> 42:31.878
- You want to bite me?
- Oh. No.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.782
- Do you?
- Oh God.

42:34.784 --> 42:37.818
Does anybody... oh my God.
Is anybody here?

42:37.820 --> 42:39.253
Okay.

42:39.255 --> 42:40.988
Tell me how good
my pussy feels.

42:40.990 --> 42:42.789
- Tell me.
- Huh?

42:42.791 --> 42:44.825
Tell me how good
my pussy feels.

42:44.827 --> 42:47.195
Oh my God, I don't want to.

42:47.197 --> 42:48.695
- Do it.
- It feels great.

42:48.697 --> 42:49.863
- It feels great.
- Say it.

42:49.865 --> 42:51.666
Why are you barking at me?

42:51.668 --> 42:53.066
What do you want? Tell me how
it feels on your dick.

42:53.068 --> 42:55.103
Tell me how my pussy
feels on your dick.

42:55.105 --> 42:57.338
If I told you to tell me how
good my dick felt in your mouth,

42:57.340 --> 42:58.740
you'd call 911.

42:58.742 --> 43:01.208
Okay.
Let's call the police.

43:01.210 --> 43:03.177
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

43:07.416 --> 43:09.217
What's happening?

43:09.219 --> 43:10.952
Well, we were fucking,

43:10.954 --> 43:12.987
and then you ruined it.

43:14.056 --> 43:16.791
Okay.

43:16.793 --> 43:19.026
You can't even
say "pussy" to me?

43:19.028 --> 43:21.128
I can say it.

43:21.130 --> 43:22.963
I asked you to say it,
and you didn't say it.

43:22.965 --> 43:24.932
- Just not all the time.
- No, it's not all the time.

43:24.934 --> 43:26.733
I asked you to say it one time,

43:26.735 --> 43:28.836
and if mine is the only one
you're ever going to see

43:28.838 --> 43:30.905
then you need to figure out how
to say the word "pussy" to me!

43:33.309 --> 43:35.677
What's happening right now?

43:38.280 --> 43:39.813
Ow. Ow!

43:39.815 --> 43:42.619
- Ow. Ow!
- Sorry.

43:52.996 --> 43:55.729
You know I would never
write erotic poetry

43:55.731 --> 43:57.898
to another woman.

43:57.900 --> 44:00.267
Because I can't read or write.

44:00.269 --> 44:03.371
That's not funny.

44:03.373 --> 44:04.972
Okay, sorry.

44:04.974 --> 44:06.206
I'm just trying to tell you

44:06.208 --> 44:07.974
that I would never
cheat on you.

44:07.976 --> 44:09.976
If that's what
you're worried about,

44:09.978 --> 44:12.447
I'm here, and if you want to
talk or you don't want to talk

44:12.449 --> 44:14.315
or you want to keep saying
"pussy" over and over

44:14.317 --> 44:16.152
until it gets weird
we can do that too.

44:18.454 --> 44:20.690
Can you hand me those jeans?

44:29.998 --> 44:32.301
Um, when are you
coming home?

44:35.237 --> 44:38.840
I just want to be here
for Ali right now, okay.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.374
She needs me.

44:40.376 --> 44:43.744
So, I'm going to stay here
for a few days.

44:43.746 --> 44:46.113
And I'll call you tonight.

44:52.454 --> 44:54.354
<i>He accepted
the German terms.</i>

44:54.356 --> 44:56.190
Oh!

44:56.192 --> 44:57.925
<i>But after
the unconditional surrender,</i>

44:57.927 --> 44:59.494
<i>the Nazis bombed the city
anyway.</i>

45:01.130 --> 45:02.896
You okay?

45:02.898 --> 45:05.032
Yeah.

45:06.969 --> 45:09.070
Ooh!

45:11.775 --> 45:14.141
You can't deny that
there's a lot of energy

45:14.143 --> 45:16.844
and confidence
behind that.

45:16.846 --> 45:19.447
They knew how to sing too.

45:19.449 --> 45:21.516
No, don't do that.
Don't do that.

45:21.518 --> 45:23.050
- What's wrong?
- What?

45:23.052 --> 45:26.019
- Why?
- Because we're not...

45:26.021 --> 45:27.188
Somebody could see that.

45:27.190 --> 45:29.023
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

45:29.025 --> 45:30.791
You're worried about
the matinee crowd in here?

45:30.793 --> 45:32.325
These guys?

45:32.327 --> 45:34.327
What's... what's the matter?

45:34.329 --> 45:36.530
I'm sorry.

45:36.532 --> 45:38.365
I was supposed to see
that movie with Ben.

45:38.367 --> 45:40.036
He likes Nazi stuff.

45:41.403 --> 45:43.938
Well, you should go again,
you know.

45:43.940 --> 45:45.273
You seemed a little...

45:45.275 --> 45:47.874
distracted at certain moments.

45:47.876 --> 45:50.010
You're so perverted.

45:50.012 --> 45:51.144
I don't think you were
quite giving Adolf

45:51.146 --> 45:52.345
your full attention.

45:52.347 --> 45:54.548
You're full of it.

45:54.550 --> 45:57.552
All these old people in love

45:57.554 --> 45:58.985
are making me feel
like a whore.

45:58.987 --> 46:00.588
- Are you kidding?
- No.

46:00.590 --> 46:02.856
Did you see what
those two old people were up to?

46:02.858 --> 46:04.358
- No.
- It was really...

46:04.360 --> 46:06.159
- It was really gross.
- No, you're gross.

46:06.161 --> 46:08.563
You're having
a torrid affair.

46:08.565 --> 46:11.898
You can't torture me.

46:11.900 --> 46:16.204
Hey, I think I love you.

46:16.206 --> 46:19.139
What? What?

46:19.141 --> 46:20.407
Just kidding.

46:20.409 --> 46:22.376
Don't do that.

46:22.378 --> 46:25.213
That's psycho.

46:25.215 --> 46:27.148
I don't know.
Maybe I do.

46:27.150 --> 46:29.383
It's hard to tell,
you know.

46:29.385 --> 46:30.450
I'm probably dead inside.

46:30.452 --> 46:31.952
You're so irresponsible.

46:31.954 --> 46:33.588
That is such a psycho thing.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.923
That's such a psycho thing
to say for so many reasons.

46:35.925 --> 46:37.224
Am I very irresponsible?

46:49.304 --> 46:51.539
What time is it?

46:51.541 --> 46:55.008
Oh, I don't know,
and I'm fine with that.

46:55.010 --> 46:56.177
I'm doing this thing
where I say

46:56.179 --> 46:57.478
I leave the watch at home.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.246
I release myself
from my schedule.

46:59.248 --> 47:00.648
- I go about my day.
- That could be C.

47:00.650 --> 47:02.650
- That could be C.
- That?

47:02.652 --> 47:04.284
Oh!

47:04.286 --> 47:05.653
That lady would break
Dad in half.

47:05.655 --> 47:07.588
That is not love.

47:07.590 --> 47:10.423
I do love her trench.
So many trenches.

47:10.425 --> 47:11.892
Yeah, I kind of want one.

47:11.894 --> 47:13.526
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:13.528 --> 47:15.229
Should I?

47:15.231 --> 47:18.499
You would look
just like a French film star.

47:18.501 --> 47:21.369
- Are you serious?
- I am so sold on it.

47:21.371 --> 47:24.237
Okay.

47:24.239 --> 47:26.440
That's going to be you
in 20 years.

47:26.442 --> 47:28.976
- Hey! Oh!
- No.

47:28.978 --> 47:31.177
Such a diss.

47:31.179 --> 47:32.679
Well, guess what, babe,

47:32.681 --> 47:34.615
you're going to be married
to that.

47:34.617 --> 47:37.184
A gentleman like that.

47:37.186 --> 47:39.186
Oh shit.

47:39.188 --> 47:41.488
- Passion...
- No, it's Dad.

47:41.490 --> 47:44.557
- Oh my God! What's the plan?
- Hurry.

47:44.559 --> 47:46.092
Ow.

47:46.094 --> 47:48.128
- Just get up.
- Ow, ow, ow.

47:48.130 --> 47:49.266
Move your ass.

47:52.268 --> 47:53.369
Hey.

47:55.505 --> 47:57.371
- Get down. Get down.
- Huh?

47:57.373 --> 48:00.307
Oh, I don't want
to see this.

48:04.179 --> 48:05.979
What's he doing?

48:05.981 --> 48:07.581
- Hey.
- Hey, Alan.

48:07.583 --> 48:10.050
I missed you.
Feel better?

48:10.052 --> 48:12.119
- All right.
- You were sick, right?

48:12.121 --> 48:15.722
Oh, don't have that
for lunch.

48:15.724 --> 48:18.358
Sauerkraut, mustard.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.626
He's getting
a fucking hot dog.

48:19.628 --> 48:22.630
Cholesterol nightmare.

48:35.510 --> 48:37.077
What the hell is
going on with her?

48:37.079 --> 48:39.612
I have no fucking clue.

48:39.614 --> 48:41.648
I thought I was going
to be planning her wedding,

48:41.650 --> 48:44.617
not feeding her
Lucky Charms.

48:44.619 --> 48:46.019
Bye, sweetie.

48:46.021 --> 48:47.253
Have a great day!

49:03.338 --> 49:05.338
<i>You have one new message.</i>

49:05.340 --> 49:07.208
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

49:07.210 --> 49:09.175
<i>I'm sorry that we keep
missing each other.</i>

49:09.177 --> 49:12.445
<i>I need to stay here
for a few more days.</i>

49:12.447 --> 49:13.481
<i>Just call me back.</i>

49:15.217 --> 49:17.050
Hey.

49:18.487 --> 49:20.387
Hello.

49:26.628 --> 49:28.429
What are you doing?

49:28.431 --> 49:30.697
Just borrowing a shirt.

49:30.699 --> 49:31.798
What are you doing?

49:31.800 --> 49:34.267
It's my closet.

49:36.505 --> 49:38.773
God, yeah...

49:38.775 --> 49:41.275
Can't control my arm.

49:41.277 --> 49:44.378
Teri! You're crazy!

49:55.057 --> 49:58.059
Whoa! Oh!

49:58.061 --> 50:00.161
Gotcha.

50:02.465 --> 50:05.199
Oh my God.

50:05.201 --> 50:06.700
What is that?

50:06.702 --> 50:08.135
It's an eyebrow ring.

50:08.137 --> 50:09.503
Yes, it is.

50:09.505 --> 50:11.639
- Well?
- Lisa "Left-Eye" Lopez.

50:11.641 --> 50:13.307
- Shut up.
- I love it.

50:13.309 --> 50:14.708
- You do?
- Yeah.

50:14.710 --> 50:17.278
It's, like, really hot.

50:17.280 --> 50:20.648
It's like squatter-hot.

50:20.650 --> 50:22.282
No, don't, don't, don't.

50:22.284 --> 50:23.717
- What?
- Don't... don't touch it.

50:23.719 --> 50:25.786
Because I don't want it
to get infected.

50:25.788 --> 50:28.822
Really?
It's un... untouchable?

50:28.824 --> 50:31.092
Aw, fuck it, I don't care.

50:33.228 --> 50:34.862
- Let's have drinks.
- Let's do that.

50:34.864 --> 50:36.463
Let's have so many.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.733
You have to get up, Dana.

50:40.735 --> 50:42.271
Dana!

50:43.706 --> 50:45.472
Oh my God, you barfed.

50:45.474 --> 50:48.309
- No, I didn't.
- This is how Hendrix died.

50:48.311 --> 50:51.579
Okay?

50:51.581 --> 50:53.313
You can't kick me.
I'm trying to help you.

50:53.315 --> 50:55.382
- I can't!
- I have to go to school, Dana.

50:55.384 --> 50:58.184
- I don't.
- You have to go to work.

50:58.186 --> 51:01.354
- Let's go to the bathroom.
- No, don't do it.

51:01.356 --> 51:04.291
- Shut up.
- Oh my God, I'm gonna kill you.

51:04.293 --> 51:06.226
If you want
to use the bathroom,

51:06.228 --> 51:07.760
then use the bathroom
by yourself.

51:07.762 --> 51:09.630
I don't need
to use the bathroom.

51:09.632 --> 51:11.499
I'm not here
to be your counselor!

51:11.501 --> 51:14.235
I have to go to school.
Your butt crack's in my face.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.735
Good, then enjoy it.

51:15.737 --> 51:17.771
What?

51:17.773 --> 51:21.175
Ben called again last night.

51:21.177 --> 51:23.409
For the millionth time
in two weeks.

51:25.882 --> 51:27.648
I don't think
he's going to keep calling.

51:27.650 --> 51:29.516
Oh.

51:29.518 --> 51:31.619
Dance, Badelia, dance!

51:31.621 --> 51:33.621
Oh my God, Ali.

51:35.590 --> 51:38.159
<i>I'm locked in here</i>

51:38.161 --> 51:41.130
while the world continues
to buzz around me.

51:43.365 --> 51:46.700
I've become nothing
but a plant to water.

51:46.702 --> 51:48.672
A piece of furniture
to dust.

51:51.641 --> 51:53.641
I'm vanishing.

51:53.643 --> 51:57.545
Turning into skin particles
floating around the apartment.

51:57.547 --> 51:59.546
Particles that bore me.

51:59.548 --> 52:03.349
Two sons
and one miscarriage.

52:06.255 --> 52:08.555
It's your line.

52:08.557 --> 52:10.657
It's on page 74.

52:10.659 --> 52:12.226
Sorry, everyone.

52:12.228 --> 52:13.860
That was a shit show.

52:13.862 --> 52:15.795
My God, did you hear
my stomach growling?

52:15.797 --> 52:17.697
It was like another character
in that play.

52:17.699 --> 52:20.300
You know... thank you...

52:20.302 --> 52:22.202
it was just so...

52:22.204 --> 52:24.204
Badly written?

52:24.206 --> 52:27.541
I'm not really concerned
with the quality of Dad's work.

52:27.543 --> 52:29.943
I'm glad it's
a pile of shit, okay.

52:29.945 --> 52:32.479
If it were better, more people
might actually see it.

52:32.481 --> 52:34.847
Mom would be
even more humiliated.

52:34.849 --> 52:37.918
Do you think that she was?

52:37.920 --> 52:39.920
He made us boys
and put the mother in a coma.

52:39.922 --> 52:41.755
Good point.

52:43.759 --> 52:45.793
Someone who can capture that
like Carla.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.228
- Do you know Carla?
- Uh-uh.

52:47.230 --> 52:48.494
Carla?

52:48.496 --> 52:50.664
Ah, thanks for coming.

52:50.666 --> 52:52.700
Holy shit.

52:55.338 --> 52:57.774
I think that's C.

53:02.378 --> 53:04.614
Oh my God.

53:06.449 --> 53:07.880
What do we do?

53:07.882 --> 53:08.882
This old lady
just pinched my ass

53:08.884 --> 53:10.416
and winked at me.

53:10.418 --> 53:12.385
Are you old enough
to drink?

53:12.387 --> 53:14.854
Mind your own business.

53:14.856 --> 53:17.691
I will take that from you,
thank you very much.

53:17.693 --> 53:19.827
I am leaving.

53:19.829 --> 53:21.929
I have a splitting headache.

53:23.398 --> 53:25.532
And that's getting infected.

53:25.534 --> 53:26.603
I know.

53:28.003 --> 53:30.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:30.972 --> 53:34.340
I will see you at home.

53:34.342 --> 53:36.610
Oh...

53:36.612 --> 53:39.479
I can't believe
we're all just

53:39.481 --> 53:41.981
in C's house right now.

53:41.983 --> 53:44.284
Yeah, I'm going to take
a dump in her bed.

53:44.286 --> 53:46.854
Who... who is C?

53:46.856 --> 53:50.456
Who are you?

53:50.458 --> 53:52.992
I'm going to go snoop
in her medicine cabinet.

53:52.994 --> 53:55.528
Wow.

53:55.530 --> 53:56.996
Not a fan.

53:56.998 --> 53:59.969
No, C is my dad's mistress.

54:04.606 --> 54:06.373
Wow.

54:06.375 --> 54:08.742
That's funny, I was thinking
she looks like your mom.

54:08.744 --> 54:10.610
Yeah, that's really funny.

54:10.612 --> 54:14.048
She's a terrible actress.

54:14.050 --> 54:17.717
This is the home that
she shares with her husband.

54:17.719 --> 54:19.720
Why would my dad
bring us here?

54:19.722 --> 54:22.856
Yeah, and also
you brought me here, you know.

54:22.858 --> 54:25.325
It's like a play
within a play.

54:25.327 --> 54:26.994
There's even someone
in a coma.

54:26.996 --> 54:29.796
Why would he do it
to my mom?

54:29.798 --> 54:32.398
And in front of
his teenage daughter.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.934
Yeah, it's twisted.
Let's get out of here.

54:33.936 --> 54:36.070
I don't want to...

54:36.072 --> 54:39.276
I'm not in the mood to...
whatever.

54:40.775 --> 54:42.342
Are you worried
about your sister?

54:42.344 --> 54:44.811
- Yeah.
- She's gonna be fine.

54:44.813 --> 54:48.481
Well, that's...
how do you know that?

54:48.483 --> 54:50.016
Because we're grown-ups.

54:50.018 --> 54:52.519
We all know monogamy
is impossible.

54:52.521 --> 54:55.389
So it's better she learns
that now from her own family

54:55.391 --> 54:57.124
than have it be some
like forbidden fruit

54:57.126 --> 55:00.427
that tears her heart out
later in life.

55:00.429 --> 55:02.362
Is that what you believe?

55:02.364 --> 55:04.700
Look at us, you know.

55:06.902 --> 55:10.005
Oh my God.

55:19.047 --> 55:22.648
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

55:22.650 --> 55:28.155
♪ Happy birthday dear...
Jeffrey ♪

55:28.157 --> 55:31.724
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

55:31.726 --> 55:35.396
Jeffrey! All right.

55:35.398 --> 55:36.796
Okay, Max, hit me.

55:36.798 --> 55:39.032
Ah! Come on,
one more time.

55:39.034 --> 55:40.934
One more time.
Come on, hit me!

55:40.936 --> 55:43.436
Ah! Come on.

55:43.438 --> 55:44.737
You guys love it

55:44.739 --> 55:46.106
when the shrimp
misses my mouth.

55:46.108 --> 55:48.778
We're too old
for this place.

55:50.813 --> 55:53.546
So...

55:53.548 --> 55:56.150
What did you guys
think of the play, huh?

55:56.152 --> 55:59.019
Well, you put mom
in a fucking coma.

55:59.021 --> 56:02.822
Hey, Columbo,
I'm the one in the coma.

56:02.824 --> 56:05.726
Okay, can I go?

56:05.728 --> 56:07.461
I have a test tomorrow.

56:07.463 --> 56:09.829
They're about to make
the volcano onion.

56:09.831 --> 56:12.132
She does.
She has a test.

56:12.134 --> 56:13.570
Fine.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.780
It's nice to see
you two be sisters.

56:26.782 --> 56:28.081
I think most of her friends

56:28.083 --> 56:31.017
think that I'm like
her weird aunt.

56:31.019 --> 56:32.820
What?

56:32.822 --> 56:34.621
You're the only one
in the family who says aunt.

56:34.623 --> 56:37.124
- Aunt?
- Too much Jane Austin.

56:39.195 --> 56:41.929
May I ask you...
a question?

56:44.900 --> 56:46.666
Shh, shh.

56:46.668 --> 56:49.735
Excuse me, hi. May I please
have another of these.

56:49.737 --> 56:51.637
Yes, and make it two.

56:51.639 --> 56:53.005
Do you have to, like,
slurp it down?

56:54.909 --> 56:56.876
I mean, Max, he notices.

56:56.878 --> 56:58.644
The same person
who threw food at your head?

56:58.646 --> 57:00.079
I asked you a question.

57:00.081 --> 57:01.215
You're afraid that
I'm going to offend him?

57:01.217 --> 57:02.483
I asked you a question.

57:02.485 --> 57:03.883
You didn't answer it.

57:03.885 --> 57:05.052
You didn't.
You asked if you could ask...

57:05.054 --> 57:06.052
What are you doing home?

57:06.054 --> 57:08.054
Oh.

57:11.159 --> 57:13.195
I don't know, Dad.
What do you want me to say?

57:15.164 --> 57:18.898
I'm flailing, okay?

57:18.900 --> 57:20.900
I'm just trying to figure out
if the life

57:20.902 --> 57:23.570
that I have picked for myself
is even the one that I want,

57:23.572 --> 57:25.104
and I don't...

57:25.106 --> 57:27.876
even know if I'm allowed
to ask that question.

57:29.110 --> 57:31.979
You may never
figure that out.

57:31.981 --> 57:33.947
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

57:33.949 --> 57:35.652
Thank you.

57:40.789 --> 57:43.090
Well, why did you want
to marry Mom?

57:43.092 --> 57:45.592
How did you know?

57:45.594 --> 57:47.994
She had great legs.

57:47.996 --> 57:49.829
And the mouth
of a truck driver.

57:53.168 --> 57:57.170
Truth is...

57:57.172 --> 58:00.577
your mother is
the best partner I ever had.

58:03.646 --> 58:04.981
I wanted to be better for her.

58:07.583 --> 58:09.519
She made me think
I could be.

58:42.351 --> 58:44.217
Hello?

58:44.219 --> 58:48.220
I got... I got
my eyebrow pierced.

58:48.222 --> 58:50.356
What?

58:50.358 --> 58:51.992
And then it looked
really dumb,

58:51.994 --> 58:53.930
and it got gross,
so then I took it out.

59:02.737 --> 59:04.905
Sounds like you've been busy.

59:07.009 --> 59:09.610
What are... have you
been up to?

59:09.612 --> 59:12.378
Did... did you get
any new holes in your body?

59:12.380 --> 59:18.050
Oh, I've been here
just holding down the fort.

59:18.052 --> 59:20.653
I miss you.

59:20.655 --> 59:23.624
I miss your voice,
and I miss you

59:23.626 --> 59:26.360
a very, very lot.

59:26.362 --> 59:28.829
You've got
a funny way of showing it.

59:28.831 --> 59:32.302
I think I just got
really scared.

59:34.902 --> 59:38.037
Of what?

59:38.039 --> 59:40.641
I don't know.

59:40.643 --> 59:43.242
Us?

59:43.244 --> 59:45.979
And then this thing
with my family,

59:45.981 --> 59:49.048
it's like I'm surrounded
by these people

59:49.050 --> 59:51.251
who never asked
any questions.

59:51.253 --> 59:52.952
There are just all of
these little things

59:52.954 --> 59:55.354
that I haven't said.

59:55.356 --> 59:57.791
I don't know, I haven't taken
a shower by myself

59:57.793 --> 59:59.226
in the last five years.

59:59.228 --> 01:00:00.927
So, shower alone.

01:00:00.929 --> 01:00:03.229
I'm not forcing you
to shower with me.

01:00:06.835 --> 01:00:09.369
I want to come home.

01:00:09.371 --> 01:00:14.074
I have not heard from you
in two fucking weeks.

01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:18.110
I know.

01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:20.981
And I'm sorry.

01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:26.853
Ali and I are still going to go
to the Halloween Parade,

01:00:26.855 --> 01:00:30.691
and your costume
is still in the closet.

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.392
And I totally get it
if you just don't want to go,

01:00:33.394 --> 01:00:36.932
but I really hope
that you do.

01:00:41.335 --> 01:00:42.904
And I love you.

01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:58.217
Ow.

01:01:02.157 --> 01:01:04.490
Be quiet.

01:01:04.492 --> 01:01:06.459
Okay.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.735
Sick.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.369
Hurry up.

01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:18.338
I'm hurrying.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:22.508
Holy dang!

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:25.845
I feel like if you bring
this much money to school

01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:27.813
you do not need it.

01:01:27.815 --> 01:01:30.083
Hey, since you live downtown,

01:01:30.085 --> 01:01:32.418
would you mind picking up the H
for the party later?

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.854
Without you?

01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:36.956
Yeah, I mean,
it's really easy.

01:01:36.958 --> 01:01:38.727
I'll tell you where to go.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.963
Yeah.

01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:53.106
Happy Halloween.
Ooh, this is spooky.

01:01:53.108 --> 01:01:56.242
Ali, one per customer.

01:01:56.244 --> 01:01:58.110
I feel like
such an asshole.

01:01:58.112 --> 01:01:59.912
You are such a thief,
and you are an asshole.

01:01:59.914 --> 01:02:01.248
This is fun.
Don't be in a bad mood.

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:04.383
I didn't think I'd get
to do this again.

01:02:04.385 --> 01:02:05.985
Happy Halloween!
Trick or treat!

01:02:05.987 --> 01:02:07.253
Happy Halloween.
Trick or treat.

01:02:07.255 --> 01:02:08.854
- Oh, hi, girls.
- Thank you.

01:02:08.856 --> 01:02:11.992
- Oh, thanks.
- Look, Emma, it's...

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:13.894
Oh, we're
the California Raisins.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:17.798
Cute, a nerd. In costume.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.001
Happy Halloween.

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.568
I think we have
to tell Mom.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.104
You know, I don't think
he's ever going to.

01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:26.039
He's not ready to.

01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:29.275
He's never going
to be ready.

01:02:29.277 --> 01:02:33.045
Can I just say...

01:02:33.047 --> 01:02:35.382
you don't understand
what he's going through.

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.117
Dad loves Mom.

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:39.853
But now he's terrified
of hurting her.

01:02:39.855 --> 01:02:41.220
So, it's not that easy.

01:02:41.222 --> 01:02:42.588
Yeah, he should've
thought of that

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:44.324
before he titty fucked
some woman

01:02:44.326 --> 01:02:46.293
whose laundry
is full of dry clean only.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.360
You went through her laundry?

01:02:48.362 --> 01:02:50.530
I'm telling her.
I'm telling her right now.

01:02:50.532 --> 01:02:54.467
Stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, Ali. Please.

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:56.503
Oop!
Pardon me.

01:02:56.505 --> 01:03:00.106
Mom? Mom, we have
to tell you something.

01:03:00.108 --> 01:03:01.208
We're going to be late.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.075
You guys look so cute.

01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:07.046
No, wait, just one picture,
just one picture, please.

01:03:07.048 --> 01:03:09.382
Go... um, just be a raisin, okay.

01:03:09.384 --> 01:03:11.550
Oh, that's cute.
Move around a little bit.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.621
- Like this?
- Oh, that's adorable.

01:03:15.623 --> 01:03:17.090
How about a little of this?

01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:23.396
Alexandra.

01:03:23.398 --> 01:03:26.999
Please tell me you are
holding these for a friend.

01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:28.267
You smoked
for 20 years.

01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:29.936
My gynecologist
smoked then.

01:03:29.938 --> 01:03:31.438
Okay, great,
we heard it.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.206
- I'll talk to her.
- This is bullshit, okay?

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:36.976
Bullshit.
Both of you are hypocrites.

01:03:36.978 --> 01:03:38.413
I'm so over this.

01:03:39.947 --> 01:03:42.514
What the fuck
just happened?

01:03:42.516 --> 01:03:44.617
I'll handle it.
I got it.

01:03:46.954 --> 01:03:48.889
She's just being scary.
It's Halloween.

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:51.394
She's a scary...
a scary raisin.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.320
Come on, darlin'.
It could've been that bad.

01:04:21.322 --> 01:04:23.491
Watch it. My ex...

01:04:29.463 --> 01:04:31.363
Can I get a white wine?

01:04:31.365 --> 01:04:32.934
You got it.

01:04:40.275 --> 01:04:43.043
I don't think
he's going to be there.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.945
It's making me sick.

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.646
Okay, well, I mean
you cheated on him,

01:04:46.648 --> 01:04:48.447
and you ignored him
for two weeks.

01:04:48.449 --> 01:04:50.550
So, I probably wouldn't
show up either if I were him.

01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:53.519
Yes, but just
take into account

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:55.220
that he doesn't know
the cheating part.

01:04:55.222 --> 01:04:56.588
Good.

01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.490
You take that
to the vault, okay?

01:04:58.492 --> 01:05:00.025
Why? What?

01:05:00.027 --> 01:05:01.628
You just throw away
the combination.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.362
Because he never
has to know about it.

01:05:03.364 --> 01:05:05.731
- Anything.
- You...

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:08.034
Ugh!

01:05:08.036 --> 01:05:10.369
Ooh.

01:05:10.371 --> 01:05:11.403
It's that time of the month.

01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:15.075
No.

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:17.043
You know, you are really
a weird little bird,

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:18.043
you know that?

01:05:18.045 --> 01:05:20.282
Mime. Sorry.

01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:24.985
You're a weird
little bird.

01:05:27.054 --> 01:05:29.722
I just want you
to be happy.

01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:37.967
He's here.

01:05:41.036 --> 01:05:43.369
How's my raisin?

01:05:43.371 --> 01:05:48.243
It looks really good.
You look awesome.

01:05:51.713 --> 01:05:54.414
You forgot to make
a pee hole for this thing.

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:56.452
- Aw.
- Hi.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:05.624
Oh. Hi.

01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:07.594
You're crying.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.695
- I know.
- Hi.

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:11.197
Hi.

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:13.166
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:13.168 --> 01:06:15.334
What's the matter?

01:06:15.336 --> 01:06:18.670
You look so nice
in this box.

01:06:18.672 --> 01:06:21.374
You are so nice
to wear the box.

01:06:21.376 --> 01:06:22.742
I love it.

01:06:22.744 --> 01:06:24.510
I mean, I hate it,
but I love it.

01:06:24.512 --> 01:06:25.612
I'm wearing it.

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:28.048
You are so good.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:31.450
Yeah, you are too.

01:06:31.452 --> 01:06:34.186
Okay, you're freaking me out
right now.

01:06:34.188 --> 01:06:37.190
Okay, yeah.
I'm not good.

01:06:37.192 --> 01:06:39.425
What happened?

01:06:39.427 --> 01:06:40.559
I did something bad.

01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:44.463
Okay. Just what?
What?

01:06:44.465 --> 01:06:47.566
A couple weeks ago,
after we saw...

01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:49.802
after we went
to the party, I...

01:06:49.804 --> 01:06:52.338
when I was at the party
and I was talking to Nate there.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.407
- And then...
- No!

01:06:54.409 --> 01:06:56.675
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Please, please, please.

01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:58.311
- Let me finish.
- Did you fuck him?

01:06:58.313 --> 01:06:59.545
I'm not putting
my words together.

01:06:59.547 --> 01:07:01.213
Did you fuck him?

01:07:01.215 --> 01:07:03.650
You fucked him!

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:06.186
I knew it.

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.487
I fucking knew it,
and I didn't say anything

01:07:08.489 --> 01:07:10.155
because I'm a fucking chump!

01:07:10.157 --> 01:07:12.157
No, no, no, no, no.
I am the chump.

01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:15.695
I can't believe you.

01:07:15.697 --> 01:07:18.597
Ben? Ben, please.

01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:20.700
Please, please!

01:07:20.702 --> 01:07:23.135
Ben!

01:07:23.137 --> 01:07:26.107
- You drop your box, Raisin Man.
- Fuck you!

01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:40.220
Never was
a disco man myself.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:43.690
Neither was my husband.

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.391
The coke was great.

01:07:45.393 --> 01:07:48.764
Yeah, so I hear.

01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:53.666
Divorced? Widowed?

01:07:53.668 --> 01:07:56.568
Uh, what if I'm neither?

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.840
Somebody married you.

01:08:01.443 --> 01:08:03.742
So how long
you been divorced?

01:08:03.744 --> 01:08:06.579
I'm not.

01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:08.680
Looking for a third?

01:08:08.682 --> 01:08:10.682
You're not his type.

01:08:10.684 --> 01:08:12.619
You're a real pisser.

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:16.288
My husband used to think so.

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:18.694
I'm Mitch.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:23.196
Let's dance, Mitch.

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:27.866
Who knows how to disco
like it's 1975?

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.652
What did I just do?

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:48.955
Badelia be crazy.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.357
I just didn't want
to be Dad.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.459
You're not Dad.

01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:55.894
You should've seen
his face.

01:08:55.895 --> 01:08:57.596
He's never going
to talk to me again.

01:08:57.599 --> 01:08:59.665
Yes, he will.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.368
I mean it.
It will be okay.

01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:05.904
Um, can you just wait here?

01:09:05.907 --> 01:09:07.607
I have to pick up
something for a friend.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.411
I'll be back
in, like, a second.

01:09:11.345 --> 01:09:13.715
No, thank you.

01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:22.988
Who do you know
who lives here?

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:26.826
Um, don't worry
about it.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.728
Ugh, Ali, no,
I hate that, okay.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.331
And also this has been
a horrible, long night.

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:33.832
Can we please just go home?

01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:35.867
Yeah, just wait
right there, okay?

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:41.609
Is this dripping?

01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:50.450
Bag and a bag?

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:52.886
Uh, yeah. Two?

01:09:54.655 --> 01:09:56.022
Two and two.

01:09:56.024 --> 01:09:57.924
What? Wait, he's taking
my money.

01:09:57.926 --> 01:10:00.293
He'll be right back,
freshie.

01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:01.760
Is this your friend?

01:10:01.762 --> 01:10:04.030
- What did...
- Just be quiet, okay?

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:06.432
Why?
Is this a drug deal?

01:10:06.434 --> 01:10:08.668
- Are you buying drugs?
- Shut the fuck up, trash bag.

01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:10.402
Uh, take a better look,
cool guy.

01:10:10.404 --> 01:10:11.970
I'm a California Raisin.

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:14.906
Dana! Can you just...
can you be cool, please?

01:10:14.908 --> 01:10:16.308
No, I can't be cool.

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:17.677
I've had the worst night,

01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:18.945
and I don't know why
you would bring me

01:10:18.947 --> 01:10:20.713
to this gross place.

01:10:20.715 --> 01:10:23.816
No offense.
Let's just go.

01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:26.552
Ooh! Oh my God!

01:10:26.554 --> 01:10:28.487
Is that a needle?

01:10:28.489 --> 01:10:31.424
- Just calm down, okay?
- I don't want to calm down.

01:10:31.426 --> 01:10:33.358
It's for a friend.
It's not even for me.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.594
And this is not, like,
a regular thing for me, okay.

01:10:35.596 --> 01:10:36.728
It's... it's a holiday.

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:38.063
The holiday is Halloween,

01:10:38.065 --> 01:10:39.632
which is not typically
a heroin holiday

01:10:39.634 --> 01:10:41.668
on most people's calendars.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.936
You're so smart.
Why would you do this?

01:10:43.938 --> 01:10:45.871
You know that people do it
one time, they get addicted...

01:10:45.873 --> 01:10:48.808
I did it once.
I'm fine.

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.476
Jesus Fucking Christ, Dana,

01:10:50.478 --> 01:10:52.411
not everything
is so black and white.

01:10:52.413 --> 01:10:55.647
Like, you can... you can fuck Nate
and still love Ben, right?

01:10:55.649 --> 01:10:57.349
Oh, shit!

01:10:57.351 --> 01:11:00.820
Okay. You need
to just step out.

01:11:00.822 --> 01:11:03.889
You're not
in this conversation.

01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:12.800
So, Mini Trash,
want your shit or not?

01:11:17.037 --> 01:11:19.405
Not.

01:11:19.407 --> 01:11:20.772
Five-o! Five-o!

01:11:20.774 --> 01:11:22.709
- What is that?
- I don't know.

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:25.477
- Yo, run, raisins, run!
- Go, go, Ali!

01:11:25.479 --> 01:11:27.813
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:11:27.815 --> 01:11:29.648
- Hold on, ladies
- Are you kidding?

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:31.483
I just said no.

01:11:31.485 --> 01:11:33.753
And I'm sure Nancy Reagan
would be real proud.

01:11:33.755 --> 01:11:35.120
But you're trespassing.

01:11:35.122 --> 01:11:37.393
Come on.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:55.641
Hey. Lenny's on HBO.

01:11:59.012 --> 01:12:03.683
Remember I took you
to see him on our first date?

01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:06.619
Then we went to night court
to watch hookers

01:12:06.621 --> 01:12:08.720
and pimps get arraigned.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:34.045
What's...

01:12:34.047 --> 01:12:35.983
What's gotten into you, huh?

01:12:38.886 --> 01:12:39.921
Hi.

01:13:08.449 --> 01:13:12.552
Oh. Oh!

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:15.021
Ah, oh.

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:18.991
Oh.

01:13:40.113 --> 01:13:42.781
Alan?

01:13:42.783 --> 01:13:43.951
What?

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.789
Which one of us
fucks better?

01:13:52.092 --> 01:13:54.861
What are... what are you
talking about?

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:58.263
Just... just stop, okay.

01:13:58.265 --> 01:14:00.799
Really, Patty,
I don't know what you're...

01:14:00.801 --> 01:14:01.933
Stop.

01:14:01.935 --> 01:14:04.105
Stop lying.

01:14:07.841 --> 01:14:10.041
I know about Carla.

01:14:10.043 --> 01:14:14.714
I read all the stupid...
fucking shit that you wrote.

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:19.285
Are you serious?
It's a play.

01:14:19.287 --> 01:14:21.286
It's... it's for the play.

01:14:21.288 --> 01:14:24.557
I should chuck that
fucking computer at your head.

01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:25.924
Patty, I...

01:14:25.926 --> 01:14:27.462
Just stay,
stay where you are.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.567
What was your plan?

01:14:34.569 --> 01:14:36.672
Were you ever
going to tell me or...

01:14:43.944 --> 01:14:47.181
Why her and not me?

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:52.652
Because she knows
I'm alive, okay?

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:55.720
She knows you're alive?
Really?

01:14:55.722 --> 01:14:58.991
When was the last time
you or anybody in this house

01:14:58.993 --> 01:15:00.692
ever even looked at me?

01:15:00.694 --> 01:15:02.093
You think I'm a failure.

01:15:02.095 --> 01:15:03.896
You said it
right in front of Ali.

01:15:03.898 --> 01:15:05.630
I did what?

01:15:05.632 --> 01:15:06.933
You don't even
like me anymore.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.300
Look, I married you, okay.

01:15:08.302 --> 01:15:09.869
Can we just assume
that I like you?

01:15:09.871 --> 01:15:12.571
I don't have to assume
with her.

01:15:12.573 --> 01:15:14.072
She tells me!

01:15:14.074 --> 01:15:15.840
Really? She tells you what?

01:15:15.842 --> 01:15:17.742
That you're so great
and that she loves you.

01:15:17.744 --> 01:15:19.778
Yeah, for who I am
and some other person

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.551
she wishes I could be.

01:15:28.221 --> 01:15:30.858
I had...

01:15:34.862 --> 01:15:37.362
I had no idea...

01:15:37.364 --> 01:15:39.800
that this was
going to be anything, Patty.

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:46.272
I don't want
to lose you.

01:15:46.274 --> 01:15:48.176
And the girls.

01:15:50.912 --> 01:15:53.148
You broke the rules.

01:16:51.905 --> 01:16:54.339
Hey.

01:16:54.341 --> 01:16:57.175
We're home.

01:16:57.177 --> 01:16:59.745
We'll all talk
in the morning.

01:16:59.747 --> 01:17:01.179
I'm gonna find a spot.

01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:02.915
Okay.

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:04.150
Okay.

01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:30.442
Mom?

01:17:32.979 --> 01:17:34.682
Mom?

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.986
Oh my God, Mom.

01:17:40.988 --> 01:17:44.022
We're okay.
I'm so sorry. We're fine.

01:17:44.024 --> 01:17:47.362
We're fine.
Mom, we're totally fine.

01:18:04.444 --> 01:18:06.247
Your father fucked up.

01:18:09.216 --> 01:18:12.485
We know.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.288
You do?

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:20.992
We haven't known
for very long.

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:23.262
And we also weren't sure.

01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:25.296
Yeah, but I should've
told you.

01:18:25.298 --> 01:18:26.866
No, no, no.

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:29.004
You have nothing
to apologize for.

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.275
I've known
for a little while too.

01:19:07.908 --> 01:19:10.108
Oh.

01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:12.210
No.

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.422
Come here.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:26.058
I love you guys so much.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.827
Even when you make me crazy.

01:19:28.829 --> 01:19:30.865
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:37.570
You know it doesn't
always wind up like this.

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:40.141
Right, it doesn't
have to end up like this.

01:19:47.547 --> 01:19:49.818
This isn't so bad.

01:20:15.509 --> 01:20:19.010
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

01:20:35.962 --> 01:20:37.228
Hi.

01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:39.231
You think you're being cute.

01:20:39.233 --> 01:20:41.066
But you're being
a fucking asshole.

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.375
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:21:23.377 --> 01:21:24.546
Thank you.

01:21:27.381 --> 01:21:31.383
Um, I made you this tape.

01:21:31.385 --> 01:21:35.523
Oh. What a loser.

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:42.227
I called it.
I knew you'd get back together.

01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:43.594
Yeah, you know everything.

01:21:43.596 --> 01:21:46.231
Yeah. Bye.

01:21:46.233 --> 01:21:47.569
Bye!

01:22:04.752 --> 01:22:08.019
Want to get high
and watch "Zelig"?

01:22:08.021 --> 01:22:10.524
Not really.

01:22:13.394 --> 01:22:14.425
What's up?

01:22:14.427 --> 01:22:16.398
What do you mean?

01:22:17.998 --> 01:22:19.697
You're not saying anything.

01:22:19.699 --> 01:22:22.304
Neither are you.

01:22:24.171 --> 01:22:27.138
My mom wanted me
to invite you

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.174
to my grandma's
80th birthday party.

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:32.378
Oh.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.647
They call you
my girlfriend.

01:22:35.649 --> 01:22:37.385
Is that okay?

01:22:39.653 --> 01:22:42.120
I like you.

01:22:42.122 --> 01:22:47.125
Like, like a lot.

01:22:47.127 --> 01:22:50.094
Um, just seems like
in a year from now

01:22:50.096 --> 01:22:53.165
we're going to be
at different schools.

01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:55.601
And, like, I don't even know
where I'll be, you know.

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:57.669
And it's, like, at some point

01:22:57.671 --> 01:22:59.772
either I'm going to hurt you
or you're going to hurt me,

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:03.474
and... like we're friends.

01:23:03.476 --> 01:23:05.510
So I just want to stay friends.

01:23:05.512 --> 01:23:07.545
Got it.

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:09.313
What time is it?

01:23:09.315 --> 01:23:11.650
- It's probably 3:00.
- Yeah, I should go.

01:23:11.652 --> 01:23:14.186
My dad's probably downstairs.

01:23:14.188 --> 01:23:16.358
Fuck his car up.

01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:27.499
So, you put your blinker on.

01:23:27.501 --> 01:23:30.102
Check your rearview mirror,
your side mirror.

01:23:30.104 --> 01:23:32.537
I know.

01:23:35.309 --> 01:23:37.576
Where am I going?

01:23:37.578 --> 01:23:40.178
Poppy's house.

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.647
You moved in with Poppy?

01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:44.348
That's depressing.

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:45.817
Thank you.

01:23:45.819 --> 01:23:47.452
It's not that bad.

01:23:47.454 --> 01:23:49.220
He spends most of his time
in Atlantic City

01:23:49.222 --> 01:23:50.555
with a flavor of the month,

01:23:50.557 --> 01:23:52.324
and I feed his cat
while he's away.

01:23:52.326 --> 01:23:54.293
Yeah, I don't really
want to go to Queens.

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.327
So, can you just,
like, sign the papers

01:23:56.329 --> 01:23:58.533
and say we completed
the hours?

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:09.641
You have every right
to be upset.

01:24:09.643 --> 01:24:11.710
Cool.

01:24:11.712 --> 01:24:15.313
You'll never know
how sorry I really am.

01:24:15.315 --> 01:24:18.784
But I'm not leaving
this family.

01:24:18.786 --> 01:24:21.753
You keep saying that.

01:24:21.755 --> 01:24:24.826
How does that actually work?

01:24:28.895 --> 01:24:31.729
I have no fucking idea.

01:24:40.573 --> 01:24:42.508
Have you ever thought
about the possibility

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:48.179
that Carla's just filling
a void you created for yourself?

01:24:48.181 --> 01:24:49.748
A void?

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.884
- Yeah.
- What is that?

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:53.919
Like Oprah?

01:24:53.921 --> 01:24:57.321
No, God, why does everyone
think I get my shit from Oprah?

01:24:57.323 --> 01:24:59.357
Because your shit
is far too wise

01:24:59.359 --> 01:25:02.429
for the amount of time you've
actually been on this planet.

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.534
All right.

01:25:09.936 --> 01:25:12.170
So, Poppy has a cat?

01:25:12.172 --> 01:25:13.705
Yeah, I've never
actually seen it,

01:25:13.707 --> 01:25:16.208
but I smell it.

01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:17.942
Easy. Okay, you got it.

01:25:17.944 --> 01:25:20.247
Okay.

01:25:21.782 --> 01:25:23.848
Easy, easy, easy.

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:27.154
Watch out for this girl
in the short skirt.

01:25:31.492 --> 01:25:33.692
I'm going to take a bath.

01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:39.630
I want to glue him
to the wall

01:25:39.632 --> 01:25:41.366
and take a flame thrower

01:25:41.368 --> 01:25:44.303
and shoot fire
into his hair.

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:45.870
And then just take some ink

01:25:45.872 --> 01:25:48.307
and shoot it into
his fucking blue eyeballs.

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:49.473
Okay.

01:25:49.475 --> 01:25:51.576
- Also kill him.
- Stop.

01:25:51.578 --> 01:25:54.379
I can't keep having
this conversation with you.

01:25:54.381 --> 01:25:56.214
If you didn't want
to have the conversation,

01:25:56.216 --> 01:25:57.883
you probably shouldn't
have told me about it

01:25:57.885 --> 01:25:59.418
because the image
of you two fucking

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.253
is in my head.

01:26:01.255 --> 01:26:02.588
Do you know
what that's like?

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:03.921
No, I don't.

01:26:03.923 --> 01:26:07.358
I didn't want to lie
to you anymore.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.561
Cheating's lying.

01:26:09.563 --> 01:26:11.530
You told me
so you could feel better.

01:26:11.532 --> 01:26:12.964
Just because
I did one shitty thing

01:26:12.966 --> 01:26:15.601
doesn't mean
I do all shitty things.

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:19.470
I did a stupid, gross thing,

01:26:19.472 --> 01:26:22.773
and I'm endlessly,
endlessly sorry.

01:26:22.775 --> 01:26:24.476
I'll always be sorry,

01:26:24.478 --> 01:26:25.843
but I also can't undo it,

01:26:25.845 --> 01:26:27.478
and I don't know
what to do.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.516
I love you. I love you.
And I hate myself.

01:26:31.518 --> 01:26:34.318
And I just...

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.190
I just, I...

01:26:38.926 --> 01:26:41.362
I don't know what else to do.

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:15.326
I mean...

01:27:15.328 --> 01:27:17.698
do you think I wasn't
scared and bored too?

01:27:20.367 --> 01:27:22.968
You asked me
to marry you.

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.436
Yeah.

01:27:24.438 --> 01:27:26.338
Because I wanted
to marry you.

01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:27.973
But, yeah, it's terrifying

01:27:27.975 --> 01:27:29.808
thinking I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:31.576
comparing everybody else to you.

01:27:31.578 --> 01:27:34.879
I know.

01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:38.849
I... I mean, what happens
in six months?

01:27:38.851 --> 01:27:41.753
I don't think
either one of us

01:27:41.755 --> 01:27:43.992
can say that
it's going to be perfect.

01:27:45.492 --> 01:27:49.527
But I can... I can say that
I love you.

01:27:49.529 --> 01:27:52.430
And I just want
to live a life

01:27:52.432 --> 01:27:54.769
where we're always
choosing each other.

01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:59.273
And I choose you.

01:28:03.844 --> 01:28:05.980
If you'll let me.

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:16.791
Will you take a bath
with me?

01:28:20.993 --> 01:28:22.928
Will we have sex in it?

01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:27.098
You know that doesn't work.

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.800
We're going to fuck
in this tub.

01:28:29.802 --> 01:28:32.603
You're gonna get
your elbows bonked.

01:28:32.605 --> 01:28:36.978
Oh, no!

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:46.384
Of course you can, honey.

01:28:46.386 --> 01:28:48.053
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

01:28:48.055 --> 01:28:49.787
I'm sorry.

01:28:49.789 --> 01:28:51.790
- Hi, Mom. You look pretty.
- Happy birthday.

01:28:51.792 --> 01:28:53.592
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.494
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- Is that mine?

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:57.963
Guess what it is.
It's a trench!

01:28:57.965 --> 01:29:00.432
- Oh!
- She got one for herself too.

01:29:00.434 --> 01:29:02.134
I did,
but it's not matching.

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:04.602
- So, we won't be dorks.
- Maybe I should get one too.

01:29:04.604 --> 01:29:05.803
No, no, don't.

01:29:05.805 --> 01:29:06.937
Yes.

01:29:06.939 --> 01:29:08.773
What are you wearing?

01:29:08.775 --> 01:29:10.709
This is what you call
a fashion statement.

01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:12.177
- You love these suspenders!
- I love it.

01:29:12.179 --> 01:29:14.579
She looks like
an adorable Doug Henning.

01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:16.113
I'm not saying
they're not cute.

01:29:16.115 --> 01:29:17.749
I'm just saying people
are going to assume

01:29:17.751 --> 01:29:19.049
that you have
to pull your pants up

01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:20.718
because you're wearing
a diaper.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.120
I think they're adorable.

01:29:22.122 --> 01:29:23.722
- I think it's so...
- A cute diaper.

01:29:23.724 --> 01:29:24.990
I'm taking this away
from you.

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:26.525
- No, you ain't.
- No, come on.

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:28.058
- I'll have it.
- Slow down.

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.693
You've cat to be kitten me
right meow.

01:29:29.695 --> 01:29:30.995
Yeah!

01:29:30.997 --> 01:29:32.664
Whoa!

01:29:32.666 --> 01:29:34.199
You didn't really
just say that?

01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:36.634
- I've been waiting six months...
- That's my guy.

01:29:36.636 --> 01:29:38.903
You cat to be kitten me
right meow, my Ben.

01:29:38.905 --> 01:29:40.772
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:29:40.774 --> 01:29:43.711
- Happy birthday, Ali.
- Thanks.

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:48.483
Hi.

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:51.782
What? No gift?

01:29:51.784 --> 01:29:54.919
It's parked outside.

01:29:54.921 --> 01:29:57.022
Really?

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:58.990
You look great.

01:29:58.992 --> 01:30:01.927
You look tired.

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:03.695
Is there something outside?

01:30:03.697 --> 01:30:05.729
Honey, it's a brand-new
horse and buggy.

01:30:05.731 --> 01:30:07.598
Be careful, it bucks.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.601
I don't even get
two presents out of this shit?

01:30:09.603 --> 01:30:12.470
You are such a tiny asshole.

01:30:12.472 --> 01:30:14.572
Happy birthday.

01:30:14.574 --> 01:30:16.040
Hey, Ben.

01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:17.675
- Hey. How are you?
- Good to see you.

01:30:17.677 --> 01:30:18.977
- Good to see you too.
- Long time.

01:30:18.979 --> 01:30:20.879
Yeah.

01:30:20.881 --> 01:30:23.618
Thanks for inviting me.

01:30:28.889 --> 01:30:32.223
Well, ah, Max!
My man!

01:30:32.225 --> 01:30:33.825
- Yay!
- Yay, he's here.

01:30:33.827 --> 01:30:36.126
He's a family member.

01:30:36.128 --> 01:30:38.229
- Looking sharp.
- He's my long lost son.

01:30:38.231 --> 01:30:39.830
- Oh, whoa.
- You have the shrimp, right?

01:30:39.832 --> 01:30:41.700
Can you... Max?

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:43.602
Can you put the shrimp
on one side of the grill,

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:46.271
not near the meat because
I'm developing a little allergy.

01:30:46.273 --> 01:30:49.241
- She's "allergic" to shrimp.
- I am. It gets me flushed.

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.875
Is that the stuff
that's really hot?

01:30:50.877 --> 01:30:53.143
- Yeah.
- I think that got me last time.

01:30:53.145 --> 01:30:54.979
- So what are you drinking, Ali?
- That's a birthday drink.

01:30:54.981 --> 01:30:56.615
It's... yeah.

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:57.949
And you guys
just let that happen?

01:30:57.951 --> 01:30:59.750
