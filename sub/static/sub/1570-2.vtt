playing)

(music stops)

00:36.040 --> 00:37.807
Ah, Frankie Scott Key.

00:37.842 --> 00:39.676
You're the white man's
Marvin Gaye.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.611
Amazing sex, Francine.

00:41.645 --> 00:43.880
Yup, you completely
reduced my swelling.

00:43.914 --> 00:45.715
And how was it
for you, Francine?

00:45.749 --> 00:47.817
It was great, right?
Wasn't it so great?

00:47.852 --> 00:49.385
As always, Stan.

00:49.420 --> 00:52.789
It was... fabulous.
Just fabulous.

00:52.823 --> 00:54.491
Couldn't have chosen
a better word.

00:54.525 --> 00:55.959
It <i>was</i> fantastic.

00:55.993 --> 00:57.961
Just think. For 20 years,

00:57.995 --> 01:00.263
I've been taking you
to Satisfaction Avenue.

01:00.297 --> 01:02.065
You know, that's where you...

01:02.099 --> 01:03.633
get off.

01:03.667 --> 01:06.736
And then wait for the next bus,
which comes right on schedule,

01:06.770 --> 01:08.872
every 96 hours.

01:08.906 --> 01:11.574
Uh, yup, that's my stop, baby.

01:11.609 --> 01:13.409
(electrical buzzing
and popping)

01:13.444 --> 01:15.512
Oh, there go the lights again.

01:15.546 --> 01:17.313
I'll check the fuse box.

01:17.348 --> 01:18.581
(match striking)

01:18.616 --> 01:20.483
Whoa, where'd you get
that old candelabra?

01:20.518 --> 01:22.318
Oh, I keep it under the bed.

01:22.353 --> 01:24.354
Next to the flashlight.

01:25.623 --> 01:28.491
(woman giggling)

01:28.526 --> 01:29.993

01:32.029 --> 01:33.596

01:33.631 --> 01:34.998
(moaning)
(moaning)

01:35.966 --> 01:37.934
(shrieks) Mom,
what are you doing?!

01:37.968 --> 01:42.639
Oh, my, Hayley, who's your
swarthy, chiseled friend?

01:44.041 --> 01:45.775
Mom, this is Mauricio.

01:45.809 --> 01:47.377
We are benefits.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.945
Benefits?

01:48.979 --> 01:52.015
Uh, he means we're friends with
benefits, but we're not friends.

01:52.049 --> 01:54.751
Well, then, just
pretend I'm not here.

01:55.953 --> 01:58.021
All right,
Mom. Creepy.

01:58.055 --> 02:00.089
Come on, Mauricio,
let's go upstairs.

02:00.124 --> 02:03.826
Please. Save your legs
for spasming.

02:03.861 --> 02:05.595
We'll try to keep it down.

02:05.629 --> 02:07.163
(both moaning)

02:07.198 --> 02:08.631
Or don't.

02:08.666 --> 02:10.433
(moaning continues)

02:10.467 --> 02:13.369
It'd be nice to hear someone
have some fun in this house.

02:14.038 --> 02:15.171
(gasps)

02:15.206 --> 02:16.439
Oh, my God!

02:16.473 --> 02:19.342
That seemed to just fly
off the wall all by itself.

02:19.376 --> 02:22.045
Oh, well.
Probably nothing.

Auf Wiedersehen!
(buzzer sounds)

02:36.594 --> 02:39.095
Klaus, you made
me lose my turn!

02:39.129 --> 02:40.296
Sorry, Steve.

02:40.331 --> 02:42.932
I just wanted to say
I'm off to Atlantic City

02:42.967 --> 02:44.534
for a weekend
of motivational workshops

02:44.568 --> 02:47.971
by Deepak Chopra, Phil Jackson,
and George Bush.

02:48.005 --> 02:50.006
The one-termer, not the hero.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.209
This weekend is going
to change my life.

02:53.244 --> 02:54.410
Bye.

02:54.445 --> 02:56.846
Steve, will you remember
to feed my pet smaller fish?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.047
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

02:58.082 --> 02:59.048
(phone ringing)

02:59.083 --> 03:01.484
Ooh, that's my shuttle.

03:01.518 --> 03:03.419
This guy's got
a broken funny bone.

03:03.454 --> 03:04.821
(with Cockney accent):
Call NBC.

03:04.855 --> 03:07.090
They'll give him
a half hour, they will.

03:08.759 --> 03:09.892
(buzzer sounds)

03:09.927 --> 03:11.060
What the hell?

03:11.095 --> 03:12.729
Steve, I did not touch the rim.

03:12.763 --> 03:14.697
Yes, you did.
The board buzzed.

03:14.732 --> 03:16.399
I've performed
this very operation

03:16.433 --> 03:18.134
far drunker and on real people!

03:18.168 --> 03:20.136
Something else made
the buzzer go off.

03:20.170 --> 03:22.138
You know, this isn't
the first strange occurrence

03:22.172 --> 03:23.339
in the house lately.

03:23.374 --> 03:26.142
I think this may be the work
of... a ghost.

03:26.176 --> 03:29.445
Roger, that is the lamest excuse
ever to get an extra turn.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.880
I'm serious, Steve.

03:30.914 --> 03:33.716
Things in this house have had
a mind of their own, and...

03:33.751 --> 03:35.952
and I've felt a dark presence
when nobody's there.

03:35.986 --> 03:38.121
And, yes,
I would like another turn.

03:38.155 --> 03:40.390
(scoffs)
There's no such thing as ghosts.

03:40.424 --> 03:42.325
Then how do you explain...

03:42.359 --> 03:43.926
that?

03:50.534 --> 03:52.468
Oh, my God!

03:52.503 --> 03:54.304
I know. Outside
of the commercials,

03:54.338 --> 03:57.006
that's the first time
I've ever seen that game work.

03:57.041 --> 03:59.442
(horn honking)

03:59.476 --> 04:00.743
Here we are, sir.

04:00.778 --> 04:02.245
Oh, what a wonderful room.

04:02.279 --> 04:04.280
Just set me down on the bed.

04:06.183 --> 04:09.252
Ooh, these sheets feel
so good against my bowl.

04:10.721 --> 04:13.823
And could you please put the "Do
not disturb" sign on the door?

04:13.857 --> 04:15.158
Of course, sir.

04:15.192 --> 04:18.928
And if you need anything at all,
my name is Benji.

04:18.962 --> 04:21.297
Thanks, Benji.

04:21.332 --> 04:24.867
ANNOUNCER (on TV): If you're a Parrothead,
try Jimmy Buffet's Key West Saloon,

04:24.902 --> 04:27.537

04:27.571 --> 04:31.107
From world-renowned chef
Gordon Fukayami comes

04:31.141 --> 04:34.510
Roppongi, a bistro house
with a South Asian flair.

04:34.545 --> 04:37.347
And if you're looking
to get your funny bone tickled,

04:37.381 --> 04:42.118
don't miss Rita Rudner's
hilarious live stand-up show.

04:42.152 --> 04:43.753
Do you know the difference

04:43.787 --> 04:46.956
between a government bond
and a man?

04:46.990 --> 04:49.492
The bond matures.

04:49.526 --> 04:51.828
(laughter on TV, Klaus laughs)

04:51.862 --> 04:54.897
Absolutely <i>incredible!</i>

04:54.932 --> 04:56.733
And if it's nightlife
you're after...

04:56.767 --> 04:58.101
Ow! My lower lumbar!

04:58.135 --> 05:00.069
...dance the night away
at our exclusive club...

05:00.104 --> 05:01.170
(groans, gasps)

05:01.205 --> 05:02.338
...Entrancia.

05:02.373 --> 05:04.140
Aah! Damn it!

05:04.174 --> 05:06.509
If you're a Parrothead, try
Jimmy Buffet's Key West Saloon

05:06.543 --> 05:09.178
located downstairs in the lobby.

05:09.213 --> 05:12.715
From world-renowned chef
Gordon Fukayami comes

05:12.750 --> 05:15.752
Roppongi, a bistro house
with a South Asian flair.

05:15.786 --> 05:17.387
Stay calm, Klaus.
The maid will be here soon.

05:17.421 --> 05:18.888
And if you're looking to get
your funny bone tickled...

05:18.922 --> 05:20.690
She'll get some back pills,
and you'll be good to go.

05:20.724 --> 05:23.092
...don't miss Rita Rudner's
hilarious live stand-up show.

05:23.127 --> 05:25.461
RUDNER:
Do you know the difference

05:25.496 --> 05:28.865
between a government bond
and a man?

05:33.937 --> 05:36.672
Roger, we've set up cameras
in every room in the house,

05:36.707 --> 05:38.508
and the only strange activity
we've seen

05:38.542 --> 05:39.976
is stuff we already know about.

05:40.010 --> 05:42.845
Like how Dad pretends he's a
mummy when he's on the toilet.

05:45.015 --> 05:47.016
(toilet flushes)

05:48.886 --> 05:51.187
Also, we know Francine
is way too interested

05:51.221 --> 05:52.588
in Hayley's sex life.

05:54.691 --> 05:56.726
(both moaning)

05:59.797 --> 06:01.998
Is she eating mozzarella
like it's an apple?

06:02.032 --> 06:03.699
Look, Roger, I admit

06:03.734 --> 06:06.636
something may have been here,
but it's gone now.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.071
3:40. No sign
of the ghost.

06:09.106 --> 06:11.808
Really have to pee, but
don't want to miss anything.

06:11.842 --> 06:13.476
Shut your stupid face. Look.

06:13.510 --> 06:15.445
In the basement.
The washing machine.

06:17.748 --> 06:19.749
(creaking, rhythmic rumbling)

06:23.921 --> 06:27.990
It... looks like... Mom!

06:29.426 --> 06:30.660
(screaming)

06:30.694 --> 06:32.061
(both screaming)

06:32.095 --> 06:33.229
Hey, guys.

06:33.263 --> 06:35.498
(both screaming)

06:35.532 --> 06:36.899
(screaming)

06:36.934 --> 06:40.303
3:43. Just peed myself.

06:41.638 --> 06:43.639
Asparagus.

06:46.851 --> 06:48.785
Oh. What did you
wake me up for?

06:48.819 --> 06:50.739
I was having a dream I
owned a collectibles shop.

06:50.892 --> 06:52.927
Was haggling with a kid
about a Grimace glass.

06:52.961 --> 06:54.595
Now, Dad, prepare yourself.

06:54.629 --> 06:58.466
Roger and I found proof
the house is... haunted.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.434
Haunted?! Pl-ease.

07:00.469 --> 07:02.770
As if a pizza guy
has ever been murdered here

07:02.804 --> 07:04.038
and buried under the foundation.

07:04.072 --> 07:05.940
(laughs, sighs)

07:05.974 --> 07:07.842
But nobody's gone
to the cops, right?

07:07.876 --> 07:09.643
What? Stan, no.

07:09.678 --> 07:11.412
I don't know how it's possible,

07:11.446 --> 07:15.182
but this ghost is real,
and it looks just like me!

07:15.217 --> 07:17.385
Well, maybe 20 pounds ago.

07:17.419 --> 07:19.754
Dad, check out this footage
from the basement.

07:20.789 --> 07:22.123
(screaming)

07:22.157 --> 07:23.357
(yells)

07:23.392 --> 07:24.725
That was scary!

07:24.760 --> 07:26.127
But-but fun scary.

07:26.161 --> 07:27.428
It's fun to be scared, huh?

07:27.462 --> 07:30.131
This is phenomenal special
effects work, Steve.

07:30.165 --> 07:31.599
No, it's real.

07:31.633 --> 07:33.267
(eerie whooshing)

07:33.301 --> 07:34.602
It <i>is</i> a ghost.

07:34.636 --> 07:36.337
And it's beautiful.

07:36.371 --> 07:38.906
Whoa, it's chosen me.
It's chosen me.

07:43.211 --> 07:45.913
Ow! That really hurt,
beautiful specter.

07:47.516 --> 07:49.483
This is freaking my deeky out.

07:49.518 --> 07:51.218
All right, that's it.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.354
I'm texting the one person
who can help.

07:53.388 --> 07:54.989
(doorbell rings)

07:56.024 --> 07:57.658
Greetings.

07:57.692 --> 07:59.960
My name is Ruby Zeldastein.

07:59.995 --> 08:02.129
I'm a medium to the other side,

08:02.164 --> 08:04.865
and I make a hell
of a shoofly pie.

08:06.868 --> 08:08.536
Are we really gonna do this?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.571
Do <i>you</i> have a medium character?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.441
(door creaks open)

08:13.475 --> 08:15.342
(inhales deeply through nose)

08:15.377 --> 08:17.878
Oh, there is a presence here.

08:17.913 --> 08:19.880
A very bitter presence.

08:19.915 --> 08:21.649
Full of resentment.

08:21.683 --> 08:23.284
(woman screaming)

08:23.318 --> 08:25.286
(wind whistling)

08:28.056 --> 08:31.392
FRANCINE'S VOICE (distorted):
You're mine now!

08:31.426 --> 08:33.193
(Mauricio yells)

08:33.227 --> 08:35.261
Mauricio!

08:35.297 --> 08:36.996
(items clattering)

08:37.032 --> 08:40.534
Is anyone else still seeing his
junk when they close their eyes?

08:40.568 --> 08:43.703
Yup.
Yup.

08:46.241 --> 08:49.543
What the hell was that thing
that took Mauricio?!

08:49.578 --> 08:51.612
Darling, that was a spirit.

08:51.646 --> 08:53.013
<i>Your</i> spirit.

08:53.048 --> 08:54.748
I'm dead?

08:54.783 --> 08:57.151
Maybe that's why
my nails have stopped growing.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.053
Oh, wait.
There they go.

08:59.087 --> 09:02.223
Not all hauntings are caused
by the dead, child.

09:02.257 --> 09:04.992
Sometimes they're caused
by emotions.

09:05.026 --> 09:07.361
Feelings kept locked away
so long

09:07.395 --> 09:10.865
that they manifest themselves
as a malevolent force.

09:10.899 --> 09:12.233
So it <i>is</i> a poltergeist.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.467
Not quite.

09:13.502 --> 09:15.769
The entity in this house
was born specifically

09:15.804 --> 09:18.072
out of Francine's
sexual frustration.

09:18.106 --> 09:20.074
I like to call it
a "poltergasm."

09:20.108 --> 09:21.642
What are you doing?

09:21.676 --> 09:24.145
I just drew a trademark
sign with my finger, child,

09:24.179 --> 09:26.313
because I've registered
the word "poltergasm."

09:26.348 --> 09:29.517
Any movie scripts you write
based on your experiences here,

09:29.551 --> 09:30.718
Ruby gets a slice.

09:30.752 --> 09:32.153
This is preposterous!

09:32.187 --> 09:34.788
I took Francine to Satisfaction
Avenue just last night.

09:34.823 --> 09:36.690
Oh, I doubt that.

09:36.725 --> 09:38.459
Now, sweetie, try to remember.

09:38.493 --> 09:41.328
When was the last time
your husband satisfied you?

09:41.363 --> 09:43.931
Well, like Stan said,
last night.

09:43.965 --> 09:47.101
Do you know that to be the
only and absolute truth?

09:47.135 --> 09:48.869
And therefore the
Christian truth?

09:48.904 --> 09:51.539
Well... sort of.

09:51.573 --> 09:54.008
It's more like...

09:54.042 --> 09:56.010
Satisfaction Avenue...

09:56.044 --> 09:57.611
adjacent.

09:57.646 --> 09:58.913
Adjacent?!

09:58.947 --> 10:01.515
But when we have sex, you
look just like Meg Ryan

10:01.550 --> 10:03.684
in that scene from
<i>When Harry Met Sally</i>

10:03.718 --> 10:06.420
when... she...
fakes... it.

10:06.454 --> 10:09.690
Oh, my God, I love that movie.

10:09.724 --> 10:11.358
Mom, this makes sense.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.294
The way you look
at Mauricio and me?

10:13.328 --> 10:15.462
You are clearly jealous
and repressed.

10:15.497 --> 10:17.364
Yes, this foul spirit was born

10:17.399 --> 10:19.567
of a lie and nurtured
by repression.

10:19.601 --> 10:20.901
Think back.

10:20.936 --> 10:22.303
When did it all begin?

10:22.337 --> 10:24.371
I guess a couple years ago

10:24.406 --> 10:28.175
when we went to that Sandals
resort for our anniversary.

10:30.512 --> 10:34.281
STAN: Oh, my God, that
was the best sex ever!

10:34.316 --> 10:36.317
Awesome as usual, right?

10:36.351 --> 10:38.419
Be honest.
You got there, didn't you?

10:38.453 --> 10:40.487
Well, actually...

10:40.522 --> 10:42.556
I have really gotten this down
to a science.

10:42.591 --> 10:46.160
I get in, I do what I need
to do, and I get the hell out.

10:46.194 --> 10:48.462
How great was it for you?
So great, right?

10:54.302 --> 10:57.938
It was, Stan.
I-It was the best. Ever.

10:57.973 --> 10:59.540
It was...

10:59.574 --> 11:02.576
fabulous.
(thunder crashing)

11:04.746 --> 11:07.748
(gasps)
God's clapping for me.

11:09.751 --> 11:12.253
You've been faking
it for two years?

11:12.287 --> 11:13.988
(chuckles) Stan,

11:14.022 --> 11:17.258
just because a jack-in-the-box
doesn't pop out

11:17.292 --> 11:20.594
doesn't mean I don't enjoy
you cranking the handle.

11:20.629 --> 11:23.597
Don't touch me. I
don't satisfy anymore.

11:23.632 --> 11:25.799
I'm the opposite
of Snickers!

11:25.834 --> 11:28.836
I'm sorry I'm not packed
with peanuts, Francine!

11:28.870 --> 11:30.838
(Stan crying)

11:30.872 --> 11:35.109
All this talk about satisfying's
getting my girdle all gooey.

11:35.143 --> 11:37.378
I think I'm wearing it wrong.

11:37.412 --> 11:40.314
ANNOUNCER: <i>And if you're looking
to get your funny bone tickled,</i>

11:40.348 --> 11:44.418
don't miss Rita Rudner's
hilarious live stand-up show.

11:44.452 --> 11:46.220
RUDNER AND KLAUS:
Do you know the difference

11:46.254 --> 11:49.823
between a government bond
and a man?

11:49.858 --> 11:52.393
The bond matures.

11:52.427 --> 11:55.462
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Absolutely incredible!
Absolutely incredible.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.065
ANNOUNCER: And if it's
nightlife you're after,

11:58.099 --> 12:03.003
dance the night away at
our exclusive club, Entrancia.

12:03.038 --> 12:07.408
If you're a Parrothead, try
Jimmy Buffett's Key West Saloon

12:07.442 --> 12:09.443
located downstairs in the lobby.

12:09.477 --> 12:13.447
From world-renowned chef Gordon Fukayami
comes Roppongi, (inhales deeply)

12:13.481 --> 12:17.017
a bistro house with a South Asian flair.
(back cracks, Klaus screams)

12:17.052 --> 12:19.887
And if you're looking to get
your funny bone tickled,

12:19.921 --> 12:24.558
don't miss Rita Rudner's
hilarious live stand-up show.

12:24.592 --> 12:26.312
RUDNER AND KLAUS:
Do you know the difference

12:26.328 --> 12:29.396
between a government bond
and a man?

12:29.431 --> 12:31.999
The bond matures.

12:32.033 --> 12:35.636
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Absolutely incredible!
Absolutely incredible.

12:36.871 --> 12:41.208
Benji!

12:45.480 --> 12:48.115
Mauricio, be strong!

12:48.149 --> 12:51.385
Just follow the rope
into the light!

12:54.022 --> 12:56.657
You did it!

12:56.691 --> 12:58.692
I'm a-free!

13:02.864 --> 13:04.331
Mauricio, no!

13:04.366 --> 13:07.334
This problem is far worse
than I first sensed.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.536
Your mother's poltergasm--
trademarked--

13:09.571 --> 13:13.273
has got Mauricio in its claws
like that claw game at arcades,

13:13.308 --> 13:15.275
except, you know,
if the claw was strong

13:15.310 --> 13:16.810
and didn't drop things.

13:16.845 --> 13:19.146
So pretty much not
that claw game.

13:19.180 --> 13:20.647
Ruby, what...
A-Are you saying

13:20.682 --> 13:22.383
there's no way
to get Mauricio back?

13:22.417 --> 13:25.786
I'm sorry, child, but this
spirit is not gonna be satisfied

13:25.820 --> 13:27.388
until your mother is.

13:27.422 --> 13:29.590
And since your father
isn't up to the task,

13:29.624 --> 13:32.126
I'm not sure who is.
STEVE: Well...

13:32.160 --> 13:34.995
Ah...

13:36.498 --> 13:38.065
Oh, no. Gross.

13:38.099 --> 13:40.167
I just need a new belt.

13:40.201 --> 13:41.568
I just don't get it.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.437
I did everything right.

13:43.471 --> 13:46.240
I can't help but feel
this is her fault.

13:46.274 --> 13:48.075
Dad, you have
to snap out of it.

13:48.109 --> 13:50.244
You got to get Mom
where she needs to get to.

13:50.278 --> 13:52.413
I can't, Hayley. I
don't know what to do.

13:52.447 --> 13:55.916
If only there was some sort
of kindly robot or magic wand

13:55.950 --> 13:57.418
that could pleasure my wife.

13:57.452 --> 13:59.219
But we live in the real world.

13:59.254 --> 14:01.889
Dad, look around you.
The ghost is getting stronger.

14:01.923 --> 14:03.690
You have to satisfy Mom.

14:03.725 --> 14:05.025
You're right.

14:05.059 --> 14:07.094
But I clearly don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

14:07.128 --> 14:08.695
You just need to get some help.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.697
A book or the Internet...

14:10.732 --> 14:15.235
Or an oversexed hippie who
just happens to be my daughter.

14:15.270 --> 14:18.839
Hayley, you are
gonna be my sex coach.

14:18.873 --> 14:21.642
Well, that really backfired
on me, didn't it?

14:26.873 --> 14:28.840
(wind howling)

14:28.875 --> 14:30.571
Okay, Dad, we're running
out of time.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.774
Tonight's the night
you have to please Mom,

14:32.809 --> 14:33.976
and we're gonna help.

14:34.010 --> 14:35.911
All right, let's do this.

14:35.945 --> 14:38.080
What's my name?
What are we talking about?

14:38.114 --> 14:39.815
All right, let's do this.

14:39.849 --> 14:41.750
Ruby and I will fix up
your bedroom

14:41.784 --> 14:43.685
to look just like
your anniversary suite.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.421
By recreating the night
the poltergasm was born

14:46.456 --> 14:48.957
but changing the
outcome, it will expel

14:48.992 --> 14:52.527
the foul horny spirit
from this family.

14:54.097 --> 14:56.798
Nobody's questioning that
and we're moving on.

14:56.833 --> 14:59.468
I call tonight the Sexorcism.

14:59.502 --> 15:02.004
Now, that's really trademarked,
because I found out

15:02.038 --> 15:04.339
that somebody else already
had "poltergasm" trademarked

15:04.374 --> 15:06.375
and now I'm in hot water.

15:06.409 --> 15:07.976
Let's start your training, Dad.

15:08.011 --> 15:10.846
First things first, what
do you do before sex?

15:10.880 --> 15:13.248
What do you mean?
Before sex I'm at work.

15:13.283 --> 15:14.883
(whistles)

15:14.918 --> 15:17.920
(John Cafferty's
"Hearts on Fire" playing)

15:47.917 --> 15:49.918
(dinging)

15:58.561 --> 16:00.529
This looks just like
our anniversary suite.

16:00.563 --> 16:02.130
It even smells like it.

16:02.165 --> 16:04.800
This beach-scented candle
from CVS

16:04.834 --> 16:07.536
is guaranteed to grease the beef
or your money back.

16:07.570 --> 16:10.038
But I stole this one,
so don't try to return it.

16:10.073 --> 16:12.040
You guys have done a great job.

16:12.075 --> 16:14.376
I just don't know if
I can pull this off.

16:14.410 --> 16:16.311
Dad, just remember
what you learned today

16:16.346 --> 16:18.113
and everything will be fine.

16:18.147 --> 16:20.048
FRANCINE:
Hi, Stan.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.617
(studio audience whooping)

16:22.652 --> 16:25.988
ANNOUNCER: American Dad <i>is filmed
in front of a live studio audience.</i>

16:28.324 --> 16:31.126
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Yeah, Stan!

16:32.729 --> 16:35.197
(birds chirping)

16:35.231 --> 16:36.865
I don't want that cup.

16:36.899 --> 16:39.801
Why would I want a non-mint
condition Grimace cup?

16:39.836 --> 16:42.471
Your selection is shoddy.

16:42.505 --> 16:45.674
Wake up, children.
Look around you.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.709
Everything's back to normal.

16:53.649 --> 16:56.284
I just acted so heterosexual

16:56.319 --> 16:59.621
that I needed something phallic
in my mouth to even things out.

16:59.655 --> 17:03.291
I just knew my Stan the Man
would take me there.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.292
(cheering)

17:05.328 --> 17:07.162
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go downstairs

17:07.195 --> 17:08.696
and work on my skateboard.

17:08.731 --> 17:12.334
I think today I just
might finish it.

17:14.569 --> 17:17.539
Wait a minute.
If Dad did the job, then...

17:17.573 --> 17:20.575
where's Mauricio?
(thunder crashes)

17:22.345 --> 17:24.546
(cracking, creaking)

17:24.579 --> 17:25.547
(shouts)

17:26.582 --> 17:28.750
What do you want from me?!

17:28.785 --> 17:30.285
You got your big "O"!

17:30.319 --> 17:34.556
No... "O"...!

17:38.561 --> 17:40.695
Come on! Let's get out of here!

17:45.802 --> 17:48.703
(grunting)
It won't budge!

17:48.738 --> 17:50.572
The kitchen door!
Let's go!

17:52.375 --> 17:53.842
We're trapped!

17:53.876 --> 17:55.610
(screaming)

17:57.613 --> 18:00.015
The Halloween decorations!

18:02.085 --> 18:03.985
Devil Austin Powers!

18:04.020 --> 18:05.987
Happy Halloween, baby.

18:06.022 --> 18:08.023
(chuckles)

18:08.057 --> 18:10.058
(thunder crashing)

18:11.761 --> 18:14.396
The walls!
They're closing in!

18:14.430 --> 18:16.264
And the house is sinking, too!

18:16.299 --> 18:19.267
It's a twofer!
It's a terrible twofer!

18:19.302 --> 18:21.736
You lied! I shook
the headboard

18:21.771 --> 18:23.738
but I couldn't curl your toes!

18:23.773 --> 18:25.740
I'm sorry!

18:25.775 --> 18:31.646
POLTERGASM: No one shall
find release until I do!

18:31.681 --> 18:33.982
Dad, what did you do wrong?!

18:34.016 --> 18:35.817
I don't know!
Probably everything!

18:35.852 --> 18:38.987
Well, you're gonna have to
give it one more money shot!

18:39.021 --> 18:40.655
It's our only hope!

18:40.690 --> 18:42.991
(moans) I can't perform
under these conditions!

18:43.025 --> 18:44.292
(Roger shouts)
(Stan grunts)

18:44.327 --> 18:45.560
I'm not going out like this!

18:45.595 --> 18:47.329
This is Mexican Tar Viagra!

18:47.363 --> 18:48.330
Now down it!

18:48.364 --> 18:50.832
(grunts, groans)
They taste terrible.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.501
That's 'cause
they're suppositories.

18:52.535 --> 18:54.136
Okay, honey.
Let's do this.

18:54.170 --> 18:57.139
I need to get you there,
and we're running out of time.

19:00.276 --> 19:02.911
I'm sorry, Stan.
This isn't working.

19:02.945 --> 19:04.846
And if we're really gonna die,

19:04.881 --> 19:07.582
can we at least
just take things slow?

19:07.617 --> 19:10.418
What do you mean?
Oh, Stan, don't you remember?

19:10.453 --> 19:12.721
We used to take all night long.

19:12.755 --> 19:14.756
You used to kiss my neck.

19:14.790 --> 19:16.191
Really? Why?

19:16.225 --> 19:19.294
Because it was never
about finishing the race;

19:19.328 --> 19:21.296
it was about running it.

19:21.330 --> 19:24.699
But somewhere along the way--
I don't know--

19:24.734 --> 19:27.903
you just started treating
our sex like it was...

19:27.937 --> 19:30.839
another one of your missions.

19:30.873 --> 19:32.908
Oh, my God. You're right.

19:32.942 --> 19:34.743
I do do that.

19:34.777 --> 19:36.344
Honey, I'm so sorry.

19:36.379 --> 19:40.048
That's okay.
Just... kiss my neck.

19:42.552 --> 19:44.986
(rumbling stops)
It's working!

19:45.021 --> 19:48.190
I just remembered I also used
to blow in your ear!

19:48.224 --> 19:50.926
(blows air)
Oh, Stan.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.396
That really turns me on.
(blows air)

19:54.430 --> 19:57.199
Francine, why didn't you tell
me you were so unsatisfied?

19:57.233 --> 19:58.533
I don't know!

19:58.568 --> 20:01.203
I guess I was afraid
of hurting your feelings.

20:01.237 --> 20:03.071
Now lick my neck

20:03.105 --> 20:06.875
and tell me I'm your favorite
horse in the stable!

20:06.909 --> 20:09.544
You're my favorite horse
on the whole frontier.

20:09.579 --> 20:11.379
(neighs, pants)

20:11.414 --> 20:13.215
Now talk like you're
the Monopoly guy!

20:13.249 --> 20:15.717
(à la Thurston Howell): Oh, you freak.
You lovable freak.

20:15.751 --> 20:17.352
Keep telling me what to do.

20:17.386 --> 20:21.089
I didn't say Thurston Howell!
I said the Monopoly guy!

20:21.123 --> 20:23.225
(kissing sounds)
(Francine screams)

20:23.259 --> 20:26.895
(Francine yodeling)

20:26.929 --> 20:28.930
(bell rings)

20:31.734 --> 20:33.735
MAURICIO:
I'm a-free!

20:35.871 --> 20:38.873
Bull's-eye.
(door creaks)

20:40.076 --> 20:43.645
This house... is clean.

20:43.679 --> 20:45.914
But as for those sheets...

20:45.948 --> 20:48.717
babadababadababadababada-

20:48.751 --> 20:51.720
babadababada-
babadababada-

20:51.754 --> 20:54.756
<i>babadababadababadababada...</i>

20:58.133 --> 21:01.135
Oh, Klaus, I heard you were
in Atlantic City.

21:01.169 --> 21:03.871
Did you try
that new restaurant Roppongi?

21:03.905 --> 21:05.339
I didn't go there to eat.

21:05.374 --> 21:07.174
I went there to improve myself.

21:07.209 --> 21:08.676
Which I did do.

21:08.710 --> 21:09.944
Oh, yeah? In what way?

21:09.978 --> 21:11.445
I'm just better, okay?!

21:11.480 --> 21:13.648
Klaus, chill out.
We're all happy for you.

21:13.682 --> 21:15.249
Well, it doesn't sound

21:23.814 --> 21:26.798

21:27.146 --> 21:28.810
