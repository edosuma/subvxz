WEBVTT

00:01.073 --> 00:02.895
Previously on Lethal Weapon...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.830
You're with Andrew. I respect that.

00:04.855 --> 00:07.691
What we had, I don't think
I'll ever find it again.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.861
I saw the invitation
to Natalie's wedding.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.130
- I don't think I'm going.
- Maybe you should.

00:12.154 --> 00:13.431
I'm a cop now.
Anything you want to tell me,

00:13.455 --> 00:15.500
- you can tell my partner.
- CIA?

00:15.524 --> 00:16.768
You went to Barnes?

00:16.792 --> 00:18.136
I'm not working with him, I just went

00:18.160 --> 00:19.404
to him for information.

00:19.428 --> 00:20.772
Just like old times.

00:20.796 --> 00:22.140
I'm sorry for bailing on you.

00:22.164 --> 00:23.408
Going on my own to get this guy.

00:23.432 --> 00:25.443
Except you weren't on your own.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.212
You lied to me and I believed you.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.513
And it almost got me killed.

00:28.537 --> 00:30.670
What you did was unforgivable.

00:59.568 --> 01:02.914
- Kip.
- Hey, bro.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.250
Is she here? Please
tell me Natalie's here.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.885
Chill.

01:06.909 --> 01:09.120
She probably got caught up at the salon.

01:09.144 --> 01:11.022
She's going to be here.

01:11.046 --> 01:12.357
Maybe she got cold feet.

01:12.381 --> 01:13.625
Is it my tooth?

01:14.141 --> 01:15.260
No. No.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.470
Y-You can fix that.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.263
I mean, there are plenty of reasons

01:18.287 --> 01:20.219
she shouldn't marry you
that are permanent.

01:20.220 --> 01:21.497
I'm kidding.

01:21.521 --> 01:22.932
I'm ki... Hey, come on.

01:22.956 --> 01:24.700
Natalie loves you.

01:24.724 --> 01:26.035
She's gonna be here.

01:26.924 --> 01:28.140
I promise you.

01:30.130 --> 01:32.208
Nothing crazy's going on.

01:32.232 --> 01:34.677
Yeah.

01:38.538 --> 01:41.150
Officer down. Officer down.
Evacuate the building.

01:41.174 --> 01:43.986
It's gonna be okay. Hold on.

01:44.010 --> 01:45.421
My partner's still up there.

01:45.445 --> 01:46.589
There's a bomb!

01:46.613 --> 01:48.991
Cole, it's still ticking down.

01:49.015 --> 01:50.394
If we could just make it to the window...

01:51.709 --> 01:53.851
And do what? Jump?

01:57.490 --> 01:59.090
Ready?

02:12.806 --> 02:14.817
This is a disaster.

02:14.841 --> 02:15.985
Who taught you how to wrap?

02:16.009 --> 02:17.320
Studied in Japan.

02:17.344 --> 02:18.821
This is wabi-sabi.

02:18.845 --> 02:20.823
The art of the imperfect.

02:20.847 --> 02:22.358
When did you live in Japan?

02:22.382 --> 02:23.993
When I was about your age.

02:24.017 --> 02:26.046
Just for a few months.

02:26.953 --> 02:29.800
But life's lessons stay with you forever.

02:31.057 --> 02:33.369
Dad... are you okay with this?

02:33.393 --> 02:36.910
Sure. It's not the wrapping,
it's what's inside that counts.

02:36.934 --> 02:38.674
No, I mean...

02:38.698 --> 02:40.098
Mom getting married.

02:42.068 --> 02:44.022
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

02:44.437 --> 02:46.483
Your mom and Andrew are...

02:47.240 --> 02:48.777
a perfect fit.

02:49.843 --> 02:52.855
Whereas, uh, your mom and I were...

02:53.407 --> 02:55.224
Wabi-sabi?

02:55.248 --> 02:56.559
You catch on fast.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.594
I have a good teacher.

03:02.291 --> 03:03.834
Here we go.

03:06.169 --> 03:07.870
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:08.546 --> 03:10.057
This is for you.

03:10.082 --> 03:12.141
Oh. It's a juicer.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.077
Baby, can you wait in the car?

03:15.101 --> 03:16.479
- Give us a second?
- Yeah, sure.

03:16.503 --> 03:17.969
- See you, Dad.
- See you, kid.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.283
So big day coming up.

03:21.307 --> 03:23.412
Is your dress all ready and hemmed?

03:24.144 --> 03:25.688
Hemming is all done.

03:25.712 --> 03:27.256
Yep.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.109
So, um...

03:30.150 --> 03:31.527
I need to talk to you.

03:31.551 --> 03:32.784
Okay.

03:34.454 --> 03:36.785
Andrew surprised me the other day

03:36.809 --> 03:37.967
with some news.

03:37.991 --> 03:40.803
He's married, he's got a family
stashed away in El Segundo?

03:40.827 --> 03:42.271
- I knew it.
- No.

03:42.295 --> 03:44.095
Um...

03:46.359 --> 03:47.703
We're moving.

03:48.181 --> 03:51.600
He got us an assignment
with Doctors Without Borders.

03:52.023 --> 03:55.084
He knows how much I love
that kind of work.

03:55.108 --> 03:57.253
But I just wanted to talk to you about it

03:57.277 --> 03:58.810
before I said anything to Maya.

04:00.513 --> 04:02.191
That's great.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.193
I mean, this whole year has prepared me

04:04.217 --> 04:05.650
to take care of her, so...

04:07.487 --> 04:09.187
Cole, Maya would come with us.

04:12.084 --> 04:13.570
You're taking her away?

04:14.327 --> 04:16.105
I just came back for you guys.

04:16.129 --> 04:17.473
It's just a year.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.642
You can say no.

04:19.666 --> 04:22.011
But just... think about

04:22.035 --> 04:24.814
what a great experience
this would be for her.

04:24.838 --> 04:27.316
Travel, international school.

04:27.340 --> 04:29.307
Just like you had with your mom.

04:30.343 --> 04:32.477
Will you at least think about it?

04:35.014 --> 04:36.959
- No.
- Really?

04:36.983 --> 04:38.694
I don't have to.

04:38.718 --> 04:40.229
It would be great for Maya.

04:40.253 --> 04:41.297
You should do it.

04:43.223 --> 04:46.168
Thank you... for this, Cole.

04:46.937 --> 04:48.137
Really.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.461
It's not a big deal.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.552
See you at the wedding?

04:57.577 --> 04:59.810
Already got my dancing shoes ready.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.995
Hello there, gorgeous.

05:13.019 --> 05:14.897
It's Daddy.

05:19.726 --> 05:20.836
Bonjour.

05:20.860 --> 05:22.171
Chef Roger,

05:22.195 --> 05:24.073
uh, speaking.

05:24.097 --> 05:26.075
Hello, Chef Roger.

05:26.099 --> 05:27.576
I'm sorry,

05:27.600 --> 05:29.612
but I have to cancel my reservation.

05:29.636 --> 05:31.046
Not again.

05:31.070 --> 05:33.015
I nailed the soufflé.

05:33.039 --> 05:34.917
I'm sorry, baby, it's just that...

05:34.941 --> 05:37.553
Oh, it's a big radio interview,
a big audience.

05:37.577 --> 05:40.356
You know? And the D.A.'s
ahead of me in the polls.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.024
- So...
- No, it's okay.

05:42.048 --> 05:43.526
There'll be other nights.

05:43.550 --> 05:45.094
Well, why don't you ask Cole?

05:45.118 --> 05:46.395
No chance.

05:46.419 --> 05:49.064
That guy is undeserving

05:49.088 --> 05:51.433
of my food, my friendship.

05:51.457 --> 05:55.137
He doesn't share info with me,
I don't share soufflé with him.

05:55.161 --> 05:57.840
Gosh. Are you okay?

05:57.864 --> 05:59.975
I'll just cuddle on the couch

05:59.999 --> 06:02.378
and see what Mrs. Maisel has going on.

06:02.402 --> 06:05.714
Aw, baby, that sounds so adorable.

06:05.738 --> 06:07.216
What are you wearing?

06:07.240 --> 06:10.486
Uh, apron, some slippers.

06:10.510 --> 06:12.454
Okay, well, I am wearing

06:12.478 --> 06:14.790
that white jacket you like so much,

06:14.814 --> 06:17.826
but... I could take it off.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.295
Just have my blouse on.

06:19.319 --> 06:21.063
Sure, but won't you be chilly?

06:21.087 --> 06:23.766
No, I'm actually really hot.

06:23.790 --> 06:25.701
Well, maybe you're coming down
with something.

06:25.725 --> 06:27.136
Okay, Roger.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.405
Do you want to get sexy with me or not?

06:29.429 --> 06:30.673
Over the phone?

06:30.697 --> 06:32.441
- Yes.
- Is that an option?

06:32.465 --> 06:34.310
- Yes, it's an option.
- Of course.

06:34.334 --> 06:35.990
I mean, you were speaking in code.

06:36.911 --> 06:38.739
Allow me to create the ambiance.

06:38.763 --> 06:40.137
Hold on.

06:45.311 --> 06:48.824
So where were we about that blouse?

06:48.848 --> 06:50.213
- Okay.

06:51.484 --> 06:54.029
I'm really, really hot.

06:54.439 --> 06:57.266
I'm thinking about
taking off some clothing.

06:57.290 --> 07:00.035
Yeah, well, unburden yourself.

07:00.059 --> 07:01.655
Take it all off.

07:08.923 --> 07:10.546
Roger Murtaugh? FBI.

07:10.570 --> 07:11.683
We need to talk.

07:11.707 --> 07:13.716
Roger, are we having phone sex or not?

07:13.740 --> 07:15.373
Can you give me, like, ten minutes?

07:25.752 --> 07:27.296
What a surprise.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.999
I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.

07:30.023 --> 07:31.266
Expect nothing, Barnes.

07:31.290 --> 07:32.868
You'll never be disappointed in life.

07:32.892 --> 07:35.037
- So what are we drinking?
- Mescal.

07:35.862 --> 07:37.373
Reminds me of Jalisco.

07:37.397 --> 07:39.552
Good times, but I can't imagine

07:39.576 --> 07:41.243
you called me to reminisce.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.267
I mean, socializing was
never really our thing.

07:45.071 --> 07:47.271
Natalie's doing Doctors Without Borders.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.110
She's taking my daughter with her.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.478
So your reason for being here isn't here.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.394
And you called me.

07:58.418 --> 08:00.529
You always saw the board
better than anyone.

08:01.631 --> 08:03.254
You want back in, Wes?

08:04.467 --> 08:05.802
I don't know.

08:07.470 --> 08:09.126
Just can't be here right now.

08:13.733 --> 08:15.044
Got anything?

08:15.068 --> 08:16.396
For you?

08:17.102 --> 08:18.568
Maybe.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.085
So what do you say, buddy boy?

08:23.762 --> 08:25.261
You want to do some good?

08:29.449 --> 08:34.320
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:37.123 --> 08:38.900
Nice place you've got here.

08:38.924 --> 08:41.203
- Expensive.
- Yeah, well...

08:41.227 --> 08:44.619
my wife is an attorney.

08:44.643 --> 08:45.908
So start talking.

08:45.932 --> 08:48.210
Relax, Detective, we're not after you.

08:48.234 --> 08:49.545
We believe your partner,

08:49.569 --> 08:51.313
Wesley Cole, is still working

08:51.337 --> 08:53.215
for his old CIA handler, Tom Barnes.

08:53.239 --> 08:56.118
Yeah, well, um... you're gonna

08:56.142 --> 08:58.654
- have to ask Wesley about that.
- Too late for that.

08:58.678 --> 09:00.489
Now, you can either play ball...

09:00.513 --> 09:01.957
Or you're gonna squeeze me?

09:01.981 --> 09:03.559
Trust me, I know the routine.

09:03.583 --> 09:04.760
This is a different act.

09:04.784 --> 09:06.551
We're talking treason.

09:06.575 --> 09:08.953
Lie to us, and you'll do jail time.

09:15.895 --> 09:17.306
What do you want from me?

09:17.330 --> 09:18.941
Wear a wire.

09:18.965 --> 09:20.609
Get Cole to admit
he's working for Barnes.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.010
Oh, no chance.

09:22.034 --> 09:23.245
Mm-mm.

09:23.269 --> 09:24.646
Throw the book at me.

09:25.131 --> 09:26.482
Roll the dice.

09:26.506 --> 09:28.117
We don't gamble.

09:28.141 --> 09:30.595
We only go after sure things.

09:31.477 --> 09:33.870
You've got a family to think about,

09:33.895 --> 09:35.591
wife running for D.A.

09:35.615 --> 09:37.893
Wesley Cole's life is about to blow up.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.394
And the only question is:

09:40.063 --> 09:42.186
how close do you want to be when it does?

10:00.306 --> 10:02.184
If you're looking for Cole,

10:02.208 --> 10:04.987
- he's gone.
- What do you mean, he's gone?

10:05.011 --> 10:07.356
Bags packed, took off in a hurry,

10:07.380 --> 10:09.892
but hey, that's Cole, right?

10:10.403 --> 10:12.314
Wild things need to roam.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.630
Yeah, did he say where he was going?

10:15.140 --> 10:16.932
He took off with some dude.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.935
Some dude?

10:20.026 --> 10:22.424
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

10:22.448 --> 10:24.173
That's a terrible picture, though.

10:24.197 --> 10:25.974
Looks way better in person.

10:25.998 --> 10:27.331
Thanks.

10:28.367 --> 10:29.678
Bailey.

10:29.702 --> 10:31.547
I need you to track Cole's phone.

10:31.571 --> 10:32.981
Murtaugh, seriously,
why don't you guys get

10:33.005 --> 10:34.283
some couples counseling or something?

10:34.307 --> 10:35.751
Not now, Bailey.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.942
Just text me the address.

10:43.216 --> 10:44.860
That's our boy.

10:44.884 --> 10:46.195
What do we know?

10:46.219 --> 10:48.664
Cartel calls him El Tranquilo.

10:48.688 --> 10:49.998
He's a hitter.

10:50.022 --> 10:51.366
Responsible for a number of kills

10:51.390 --> 10:53.202
in L.A. and Central America.

10:53.226 --> 10:54.888
We need him alive.

11:20.019 --> 11:21.247
Now.

11:28.761 --> 11:31.907
That's a complicated question.

11:33.432 --> 11:35.733
Down.

11:37.770 --> 11:39.615
Let's see.

11:40.652 --> 11:42.644
Whose lucky day is it?

11:49.382 --> 11:50.915
Maya.

11:53.632 --> 11:55.399
Andrew?

12:21.187 --> 12:23.053
Why is Andrew your mark?

12:27.186 --> 12:29.464
Cole. We have a problem.

12:29.488 --> 12:31.522
Yeah? Which one?

12:39.586 --> 12:41.065
Get off me!

13:02.421 --> 13:04.722
LAPD!

13:07.293 --> 13:08.813
Cole?

13:34.370 --> 13:36.378
Yo, I got what you asked for,

13:36.403 --> 13:37.714
but I don't think you should look.

13:37.738 --> 13:39.883
Is that Andrew's file? Why?
Did you find something?

13:39.907 --> 13:41.084
No. Doc's clean as a whistle,

13:41.108 --> 13:42.385
but you don't want to be that guy.

13:42.409 --> 13:44.120
- What guy?
- We've all been there.

13:44.144 --> 13:47.457
Have I used police resources
to stalk a guy or two? Sure.

13:47.481 --> 13:49.125
But it's no way to live.

13:49.149 --> 13:50.727
You lost the girl, just let it go.

13:50.751 --> 13:53.018
Gute, respectfully, file.

13:55.489 --> 13:57.901
Call me if you want to get drunk
and get into a bar fight.

13:57.925 --> 13:59.269
I got you.

13:59.293 --> 14:00.970
Anything good in there?

14:00.994 --> 14:02.605
Or didn't you hear?

14:02.629 --> 14:06.276
Our vic nose-dived from
a high-rise last night.

14:06.300 --> 14:10.313
Yeah, I heard. Yeah.
There was nothing good in here.

14:10.337 --> 14:12.043
Dead end.

14:12.673 --> 14:16.419
I couldn't find you last night.
Where were you?

14:16.443 --> 14:19.589
Home. Wrapping wedding
presents with Maya.

14:19.613 --> 14:21.057
Paper cut.

14:21.081 --> 14:22.492
Dangerous work.

14:23.221 --> 14:26.729
Look, I know things have been
a little sticky between us,

14:26.753 --> 14:29.499
but if you've got something going on,

14:29.523 --> 14:31.834
now is the time to tell me.

14:31.858 --> 14:33.064
Such as?

14:34.861 --> 14:38.704
Things you may be involved with
outside of the LAPD.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.611
There they are!

14:41.635 --> 14:43.313
The dream team!

14:43.337 --> 14:46.249
That vic who fell into
our laps last night, two words:

14:46.273 --> 14:48.384
Cartel. Assassin.

14:48.408 --> 14:49.786
His cell is a treasure trove.

14:49.810 --> 14:52.555
The D.A.'s already confiscated
$10 million in drug money.

14:52.579 --> 14:53.918
Pound it.

14:54.566 --> 14:57.860
Guys, if we can't celebrate
the wins, what are we?

14:57.884 --> 14:59.162
Doughnuts on me.

14:59.186 --> 15:01.820
Need to lay off the sweets.
Got a tux to fit into.

15:05.759 --> 15:07.425
Something going on that
I should know about?

15:08.795 --> 15:12.130
The less you know, the better. Trust me.

15:14.564 --> 15:17.947
You know I trust you. Have fun.

15:17.971 --> 15:19.382
- Let's go!
- Wow.

15:19.406 --> 15:20.950
No bloodshot eyes for the photos.

15:20.974 --> 15:23.207
I don't even want to be going
on this bachelor party.

15:23.231 --> 15:25.421
- Uh-huh.
- This is a stupid rite of passage.

15:25.445 --> 15:27.205
Right. Okay, I'll just tell the
guys you want to hang with me

15:27.229 --> 15:29.526
and the ladies tonight then? That's fine?

15:29.551 --> 15:30.701
Hey, guys.

15:30.725 --> 15:33.796
Cole? What are you doing here?

15:33.820 --> 15:35.064
I just wanted to check in.

15:35.088 --> 15:37.211
See if you need any help
before the big day.

15:38.309 --> 15:42.305
Um, no. No, I think we're good.

15:42.329 --> 15:44.641
Hi, Natalie! We love you!

15:44.665 --> 15:46.564
That is a monster limo.

15:48.001 --> 15:49.679
Yeah. You know, my friends
are just throwing me

15:49.703 --> 15:52.248
a-a little bachelor party. It's
not a big deal, very low-key.

15:52.272 --> 15:55.340
You know what's crazy? I've
never been to a bachelor party.

15:56.910 --> 15:59.177
- Hmm.
- Bet they're lots of fun.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.026
Do you want to come along, Cole?

16:03.050 --> 16:05.428
No... Really?

16:05.452 --> 16:06.829
That'd be cool? Why not?

16:06.853 --> 16:08.698
Yeah, of course. I'm
gonna go tell the guys.

16:08.722 --> 16:10.199
- Okay.
- Wow.

16:10.223 --> 16:12.568
Okay, that's gonna be
his last smooch tonight.

16:12.592 --> 16:14.040
Cole.

16:15.421 --> 16:16.866
What's going on?

16:17.001 --> 16:19.431
I just wanted to spend some time
before you guys ship out.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.167
Don't worry, Nat.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.371
I'll make sure he comes back
in one piece.

16:30.677 --> 16:32.789
My boys, it's a bachelor party!

16:38.952 --> 16:40.296
What are we drinking?

16:40.320 --> 16:41.864
What do you guys want?

16:41.888 --> 16:43.399
Shots!

16:43.423 --> 16:45.768
Whoo!

16:58.739 --> 17:00.249
Cole, come on!

17:12.786 --> 17:15.064
I have something I want
to confess to you, Cole.

17:15.088 --> 17:16.898
I used to be intimidated by you.

17:16.923 --> 17:18.300
Why?

17:18.325 --> 17:20.169
The whole James Bond and, like, you know,

17:20.193 --> 17:21.503
the Jason Bourne.

17:22.191 --> 17:24.006
But you know what, Cole?

17:24.569 --> 17:26.664
We're not so different, you and I.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.187
CIA. I'm in.

17:32.118 --> 17:35.208
Andrew, what are you talking about?

17:35.232 --> 17:38.647
They approached me when I joined
Doctors Without Borders,

17:38.671 --> 17:41.624
and they asked me if I
would look the other way

17:41.648 --> 17:45.228
while they ran some "shipments"
through my camp.

17:45.252 --> 17:46.467
What kind of shipments?

17:46.491 --> 17:48.464
I don't, I don't know. Maybe guns?

17:48.488 --> 17:52.001
Do you realize what you've done? Huh?

17:52.025 --> 17:54.036
You put yourself,

17:54.060 --> 17:56.973
Nat, Maya in danger.

17:58.765 --> 18:00.198
I'm gonna be sick.

18:03.737 --> 18:08.017
Oh, this is the worst decision
of my life.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.452
I'm a rat.

18:09.476 --> 18:11.154
A disgrace to the badge.

18:11.178 --> 18:14.357
Lowest cop there is,
besides federal agents

18:14.381 --> 18:17.994
that force other cops
to spy on their partners.

18:18.915 --> 18:20.218
I can't do this.

18:27.115 --> 18:29.639
Roger, what are you doing here?

18:29.663 --> 18:30.807
Uh...

18:30.831 --> 18:32.842
- Did you follow me?
- What?

18:32.866 --> 18:34.010
No.

18:34.034 --> 18:35.711
Okay,

18:35.735 --> 18:38.714
yeah. Maybe because friends

18:38.738 --> 18:40.516
don't let friends

18:40.540 --> 18:42.151
crash their ex's

18:42.175 --> 18:44.353
fiancé's bachelor party, do they?

18:44.377 --> 18:46.422
I'm actually glad that you're
here. I could use a friend.

18:47.225 --> 18:48.224
Me?

18:48.248 --> 18:49.859
Yeah, you're the only person I can trust.

18:49.883 --> 18:51.360
Now, I'm in a bind.

18:51.384 --> 18:52.795
Natalie told me she's taking Maya away,

18:52.819 --> 18:54.430
and I freaked out and I called Barnes.

18:54.454 --> 18:55.731
I know I shouldn't have...

18:55.755 --> 18:56.966
Wait, wait, wait...

18:56.990 --> 18:58.434
Roger, I have to get this
off my chest, okay?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.102
Now somebody, maybe Barnes,
is using Andrew to ship guns.

19:00.126 --> 19:01.304
But, uh, you know what? My hands,

19:01.328 --> 19:02.705
look at my hands, they're so filthy.

19:02.729 --> 19:05.875
And we got to turn the water on
so that I can get them clean

19:05.899 --> 19:08.044
before I...

19:08.068 --> 19:11.380
- I got something to tell you.
- Not now, Roger.

19:17.344 --> 19:20.111
Aah! Aah!

19:24.818 --> 19:26.885
It's occupied!

20:29.382 --> 20:30.415
No!

20:31.651 --> 20:34.330
- Who do you work for?!
- FBI, man, FBI!

20:34.354 --> 20:35.855
FBI! Freeze!

20:35.879 --> 20:37.033
- Hands up!
- FBI.

20:37.057 --> 20:38.467
Don't move. Hands up!

20:38.491 --> 20:39.936
Nice work, Detective.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.794
On the ground! Get on the ground!

20:45.699 --> 20:48.814
Well, Roger, I'm glad
I finally opened up.

20:59.569 --> 21:00.813
Sorry, but you're in my seat.

21:00.837 --> 21:02.681
But why do you think
that is, Detective Cole?

21:02.705 --> 21:05.663
'Cause I illegally downloaded
A Star is Born?

21:05.688 --> 21:07.832
- It's a great movie.
- I don't think you understand

21:07.856 --> 21:09.067
the severity of this situation.

21:09.091 --> 21:11.536
Or maybe you don't.
Certain government agencies

21:11.560 --> 21:14.272
don't take too kindly
to on-the-record interviews.

21:14.296 --> 21:15.674
Government agencies

21:15.698 --> 21:18.510
like the CIA? Small problem with that.

21:18.534 --> 21:21.501
Tom Barnes hasn't worked
for the CIA for six months.

21:23.872 --> 21:26.751
That's... not possible.

21:26.775 --> 21:29.854
He was let go right around the time

21:29.878 --> 21:32.123
you showed up playing cop.

21:32.147 --> 21:34.025
Now he's running guns for drugs

21:34.049 --> 21:37.988
through medical camps and having
unsuspecting doctors help him.

21:41.492 --> 21:43.068
What do you want from me?

21:43.092 --> 21:44.803
Help us take down Barnes.

21:44.827 --> 21:47.772
Wear a wire. Get him to talk. Easy.

21:47.796 --> 21:50.523
If you think it'll be easy
to take him down,

21:50.547 --> 21:52.899
then you don't know a thing
about Tom Barnes.

21:55.337 --> 21:56.581
You think Cole actually did something?

21:56.605 --> 21:57.749
I don't know.

21:57.773 --> 21:59.251
You think they're gonna
check my computer?

21:59.275 --> 22:00.585
Because I've been doing
a lot of extra stuff

22:00.609 --> 22:01.753
for these guys lately.

22:01.777 --> 22:02.954
Don't tell me that, Bailey.

22:02.978 --> 22:04.623
Oh, please, Avery. You know everything.

22:04.647 --> 22:06.458
I don't... Wait, are you wearing a wire?

22:06.482 --> 22:07.926
Are you wearing a wire?

22:07.950 --> 22:09.327
Look, I know I'm new here,

22:09.351 --> 22:11.420
but I don't know
what y'all are capable of,

22:11.444 --> 22:14.734
and y'all sure as hell
don't know what I'm capable of.

22:15.457 --> 22:17.102
She's right.

22:17.126 --> 22:19.237
If you'd have told me that
Roger Murtaugh would wear a wire

22:19.261 --> 22:22.700
to bring down his partner,
I'd never believe you.

22:31.373 --> 22:33.040
I should have never done it, okay?

22:34.810 --> 22:37.214
I hate myself for wearing that wire.

22:38.647 --> 22:40.358
I can't even look in the mirror.

22:40.382 --> 22:42.382
- Roger...
- Let me finish.

22:45.139 --> 22:46.520
They threatened my family.

22:48.157 --> 22:51.836
And then you lied to me,
and my head all spun around.

22:51.860 --> 22:53.606
I didn't trust you.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.476
But it doesn't matter what you did.

23:00.002 --> 23:01.513
I crossed a line.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.782
I can never get that back.

23:04.492 --> 23:06.067
You should have never worn that wire...

23:06.091 --> 23:07.652
Were you not just hearing...

23:07.676 --> 23:09.309
...on your chest. It's a rookie move.

23:10.512 --> 23:13.125
Really? Well, where else
should I have worn it?

23:19.207 --> 23:21.207
Wouldn't that chafe?

23:22.551 --> 23:23.702
Excuse me, Detective.

23:23.726 --> 23:25.470
We have some more
questions for your partner.

23:25.494 --> 23:26.526
Yes.

23:28.411 --> 23:29.619
Hey, Roger.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.009
You did the right thing.

23:31.033 --> 23:32.844
You honored the badge.

23:33.466 --> 23:36.203
When you look in the mirror, what
you should see is a good cop.

23:51.453 --> 23:54.999
Cole, really? It's 2:00 in the morning,

23:55.023 --> 23:56.501
I'm getting married tomorrow

23:56.525 --> 23:59.371
and the police just brought
my fiancé back sans tooth.

23:59.395 --> 24:01.841
Yeah. Bachelor parties.

24:03.634 --> 24:05.427
Look, Nat, um...

24:07.263 --> 24:08.973
I'm not gonna be able
to make it to your wedding.

24:15.670 --> 24:16.914
Hey, what's wrong?

24:16.939 --> 24:18.523
It's like you said.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.502
Chaos has a tendency to follow me.

24:20.943 --> 24:23.605
I was hoping to say goodbye to Maya.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.962
I don't know
when I'm gonna see her again.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.575
Yeah.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.952
Okay, I'll give you two a minute.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.946
- Dad?
- Hey.

24:44.583 --> 24:45.894
Hope I didn't wake you up.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.718
No, I was already awake.

24:50.656 --> 24:55.537
Got a lot of big changes
coming up, kiddo.

24:55.936 --> 24:57.439
How you doing?

24:57.463 --> 25:00.409
I mean, a whole year away?

25:00.816 --> 25:04.111
I'll miss my friends and debate.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.438
But I'm really gonna miss you.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.200
Me, too.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.390
You know, sometimes
the things that scare us

25:16.290 --> 25:17.715
are the best parts of life.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.086
Like me coming back here.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.732
I didn't think I'd be able to do it.

25:24.381 --> 25:26.724
Being with you and your mom?

25:28.761 --> 25:30.761
It's been the best year of my life.

25:33.197 --> 25:34.675
Love you, Dad.

25:34.819 --> 25:36.819
I love you, baby.

26:00.743 --> 26:02.454
How much do they know?

26:02.478 --> 26:03.889
Enough.

26:03.913 --> 26:06.341
They've been watching you
since you left the CIA.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.827
They think I've been working
for you this whole time.

26:08.851 --> 26:10.718
I'm sorry about that.

26:12.488 --> 26:13.966
Let me take you in.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.345
Can't do it, buddy boy.

26:16.369 --> 26:19.608
It's over. They know everything.

26:19.632 --> 26:22.430
Except how it ends.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.610
Ow! What just...

26:27.634 --> 26:28.886
We lost audio.

26:28.910 --> 26:33.052
Your FBI friends won't hear another word.

26:33.076 --> 26:35.120
They're gonna catch up to you eventually.

26:35.144 --> 26:36.704
That's where you come in.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.918
I'm gonna need some running around money.

26:39.942 --> 26:41.620
It's pricey, being on the lam.

26:41.644 --> 26:44.456
I got about 40 on me. Will that do?

26:44.480 --> 26:49.428
Figure, uh, ten million
ought to, that ought to do it.

26:49.452 --> 26:50.863
Ten million?

26:50.887 --> 26:55.601
The same amount that you just
confiscated from Mr. Tranquilo.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.002
I need it.

26:57.433 --> 26:59.293
Why would I help you?

27:00.515 --> 27:02.515
Because if you don't...

27:05.368 --> 27:07.346
...Natalie won't make it to her wedding.

27:07.985 --> 27:09.882
Take it easy.

27:09.906 --> 27:14.153
You need me, or you won't see her again.

27:14.177 --> 27:15.951
I'll be in touch.

27:27.156 --> 27:28.867
Didn't get a damn thing.

27:28.891 --> 27:30.324
Sorry, guys.

27:42.839 --> 27:45.005
Pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up.

27:58.521 --> 28:00.232
Let me guess. You need my help again.

28:00.256 --> 28:01.600
Detective Murtaugh.

28:01.624 --> 28:03.669
If you know anything about
Cole's whereabouts, then...

28:03.693 --> 28:06.668
Treason. Got it.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.446
They're getting desperate.

28:14.470 --> 28:16.849
You need to tell me what's going on.

28:16.873 --> 28:19.818
I need $10 million.

28:22.245 --> 28:25.557
I think I prefer it better
when we weren't speaking.

28:25.581 --> 28:27.248
Barnes has Natalie.

28:28.128 --> 28:29.595
He wants the money that we confiscated

28:29.619 --> 28:30.763
or he's gonna kill her.

28:31.527 --> 28:33.699
He's probably gonna kill her anyways.

28:33.723 --> 28:35.300
I should've known something
like this could happen.

28:35.324 --> 28:37.603
I should've just come clean
to you from the beginning.

28:37.627 --> 28:40.631
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
We'll get her back.

28:40.655 --> 28:43.635
How? We can't just walk into
RHD and take $10 million.

28:43.659 --> 28:45.577
No. We can't.

28:45.601 --> 28:48.814
But this is why it pays to have friends.

28:49.211 --> 28:51.383
So, we're either in or we're out.

28:51.407 --> 28:53.385
It's got to be all of us or none of us.

28:53.409 --> 28:55.320
We could get fired for this.

28:55.344 --> 28:57.156
We could get arrested for this.

28:59.148 --> 29:00.211
Hey, guys.

29:00.236 --> 29:01.860
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:01.884 --> 29:05.386
The D.A.'s on his way over to do
a photo op with the ten million.

29:07.423 --> 29:10.457
Aisle four of the evidence locker.

29:15.264 --> 29:16.742
What's up, Monty?

29:16.766 --> 29:18.177
Got some more evidence from that seizure.

29:18.201 --> 29:19.344
We're gonna put it up.

29:19.368 --> 29:20.659
Uh-huh.

29:39.055 --> 29:40.304
Thank you, guys.

29:46.102 --> 29:48.353
Bailey, are we still cops?

30:14.650 --> 30:16.788
I told you when we first started
working together,

30:16.812 --> 30:17.954
no attachments.

30:17.978 --> 30:19.497
It makes you vulnerable.

30:19.843 --> 30:21.966
You want her back? Hand over the money.

30:21.990 --> 30:24.035
Don't get any ideas

30:24.059 --> 30:25.169
about coming after me.

30:25.193 --> 30:26.993
You have too much to live for now.

30:28.163 --> 30:30.141
You, too, Detective.

30:31.104 --> 30:33.444
Pretty wife, sweet kids.

30:33.468 --> 30:35.578
You can't always be there
to protect them.

30:35.602 --> 30:37.148
Easy, Roger.

30:37.172 --> 30:39.050
You got the money. Now where is she?

30:39.074 --> 30:41.007
Upstairs. Top floor.

30:51.420 --> 30:55.366
Son of a bitch shot me.

30:55.390 --> 30:57.568
I can't have you following me, Cole.

30:57.592 --> 30:59.826
He'll bleed out
if you don't do something.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.639
You can only save one of them.

31:01.663 --> 31:04.309
See, that's the problem
with having too many friends.

31:05.801 --> 31:07.766
Come on, man, I'm taking you to a doctor.

31:08.590 --> 31:13.246
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.021
- Help!
- Natalie!

31:17.045 --> 31:18.318
Cole!

31:19.047 --> 31:21.314
Cole? I can't move.

31:23.018 --> 31:24.562
I'm tied to...

31:24.586 --> 31:26.164
Oh, my God, Roger.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.465
This is not a hospital.

31:27.489 --> 31:29.334
No. But she's the best doctor I know.

31:29.358 --> 31:30.401
It's okay, it's okay.

31:33.462 --> 31:34.906
Hey, that's a nice dress.

31:34.930 --> 31:36.574
You look great.

31:36.598 --> 31:38.109
You take care of him,
I'll take care of you.

31:38.133 --> 31:40.511
Uh, they told me I can't move.

31:40.535 --> 31:41.612
I can't move off the bomb.

31:44.773 --> 31:46.773
What is it? What is it?

31:52.647 --> 31:55.059
- Is it okay? It's okay? Okay.
- Yeah. All right... be careful.

31:55.083 --> 31:56.194
Yeah, just put pressure right there.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.585
Uh, water.

32:02.724 --> 32:04.035
Thank you.

32:04.059 --> 32:05.878
- Okay.
- How's he look?

32:05.902 --> 32:07.605
Not too bad. How's the bomb?

32:08.076 --> 32:09.574
I've seen worse.

32:09.598 --> 32:11.558
Now that we've made
each other feel better,

32:11.582 --> 32:13.378
what's really going on here?

32:13.402 --> 32:15.580
Natalie, if you move off this plate,

32:15.604 --> 32:16.748
this whole place will blow.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.916
Roger, the bullet went through,

32:18.940 --> 32:20.485
but if we don't stop
the bleeding, you're gonna die.

32:20.509 --> 32:22.487
Okay, can we go back to lying?

32:22.511 --> 32:23.788
EMTs should be here in five.

32:23.812 --> 32:26.424
That's not enough time.
I need to cauterize it.

32:26.970 --> 32:28.259
The Rambo?

32:28.283 --> 32:29.594
You read my mind.

32:29.618 --> 32:31.796
Rambo. Yeah. Sounds good.

32:31.820 --> 32:34.332
- What is that?
- Don't ask.

32:34.356 --> 32:36.667
Oh, man. Okay, look,

32:36.691 --> 32:39.837
if I'm gonna die, then I need
to make a call, okay?

32:39.861 --> 32:41.672
Can you hand me my phone?

32:50.205 --> 32:53.551
Look, how does $10 million
just come up missing?

32:53.575 --> 32:57.355
I think it is another example
of the D.A.'s very real

32:57.379 --> 32:59.123
accountability problem.

32:59.147 --> 33:00.485
We have a listener calling in.

33:00.509 --> 33:02.960
Roger from Sherman Oaks,
you're on with Trish Murtaugh.

33:02.984 --> 33:05.897
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

33:05.921 --> 33:07.598
Roger.

33:07.622 --> 33:10.935
Um, this is my husband, full disclosure.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.637
- Uh...
- What's going on?

33:12.661 --> 33:14.527
I just wanted you and the, uh...

33:16.524 --> 33:18.424
...listening public to know...

33:18.934 --> 33:21.379
...what an amazing woman you are.

33:22.077 --> 33:23.648
Honey.

33:23.672 --> 33:25.716
And I don't know if I deserve you,

33:25.740 --> 33:27.030
but, uh...

33:27.843 --> 33:29.309
I hope I made you happy.

33:31.313 --> 33:32.990
The life we had together...

33:33.014 --> 33:34.759
you and the kids...

33:36.595 --> 33:37.993
If I die today...

33:39.835 --> 33:42.066
- I die a happy man.
- Roger.

33:42.090 --> 33:43.734
Roger, are you okay?

33:45.427 --> 33:46.904
Never better, sweetie.

33:46.928 --> 33:48.172
I love you.

33:48.196 --> 33:50.029
Roger, I...

33:55.437 --> 33:57.748
- Here we go.
- Wait, w-what are you doing?

33:57.772 --> 33:58.850
Here we go.

33:58.874 --> 34:00.418
Okay, what is it? Wait.

34:00.442 --> 34:01.986
Why're you putting gunpowder?

34:02.010 --> 34:03.187
- What are you do...
- No.

34:03.211 --> 34:05.356
Wait, wait, wait! Whoa, whoa!

34:10.819 --> 34:13.630
It's okay.

34:13.655 --> 34:14.699
Sorry, buddy.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.868
The wound is sealed.

34:16.891 --> 34:18.703
But we need to get
to a hospital right away.

34:18.726 --> 34:21.494
- Okay, buddy. I got you, I got you.
- You got him?

34:25.900 --> 34:28.045
EMTs will be downstairs.

34:28.069 --> 34:30.670
- What are you doing?
- I'm staying here.

34:34.242 --> 34:35.775
See you, Roger.

34:39.813 --> 34:42.226
Cole? Cole!

34:42.929 --> 34:44.462
It started beeping.

34:49.309 --> 34:50.741
Timer.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.172
You should go, Cole.

34:54.784 --> 34:56.495
Please.

34:56.965 --> 34:59.132
Cole, please.

35:00.569 --> 35:02.569
I'm not going anywhere without you.

35:04.639 --> 35:06.317
Besides, it's fine.

35:06.341 --> 35:08.085
We just got to find something
to hold the trigger down.

35:08.109 --> 35:10.008
Buy us a few seconds.

35:14.883 --> 35:17.495
- Officer down. Officer down.
- Evacuate the building.

35:17.519 --> 35:18.930
Go, go, go.

35:20.155 --> 35:21.699
Oh.

35:21.723 --> 35:23.100
Will this work?

35:23.883 --> 35:25.550
That'll do.

35:30.465 --> 35:32.843
It's just gonna buy us a few seconds.

35:32.867 --> 35:35.413
Just got to... make it to the window.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.428
And do what?

35:37.452 --> 35:38.620
Jump?

35:39.641 --> 35:41.608
- Then what?
- Leap of faith.

35:43.511 --> 35:44.811
We jump and we see.

35:55.056 --> 35:56.856
Ready?

36:02.168 --> 36:03.241
One...

36:03.265 --> 36:04.375
Let's go! Let's go!

36:04.399 --> 36:07.211
- It's gonna be okay.
- Hold on.

36:07.235 --> 36:08.579
My partner's still up there.

36:08.603 --> 36:10.248
Two...

36:10.778 --> 36:12.043
three.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.366
- Hold on.
- Cole!

36:39.801 --> 36:41.646
I got you.

37:02.324 --> 37:03.747
Don't let go.

37:04.826 --> 37:06.492
Never again.

37:13.848 --> 37:15.097
She's here!

37:15.121 --> 37:17.249
Andrew, she's here!

37:23.191 --> 37:24.968
Lot of people waiting for you.

37:25.525 --> 37:27.392
You should get inside.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.064
Yeah.

37:33.414 --> 37:35.047
How do I look?

37:43.911 --> 37:45.711
Perfect.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.601
Good news, the bride.

37:57.625 --> 37:59.536
Okay.

38:14.108 --> 38:16.008
Look.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.440
I am so sorry.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.118
No, she's not.

38:52.380 --> 38:54.274
No way.

38:57.451 --> 38:58.662
Let's go.

38:59.987 --> 39:02.566
Cole! Wait.

39:07.560 --> 39:08.937
Did you forget something?

39:08.962 --> 39:10.695
Come here.

39:17.505 --> 39:19.783
Is that what all weddings are like?

39:19.807 --> 39:21.426
'Cause that was awesome.

39:22.635 --> 39:24.421
Where to?

39:24.445 --> 39:26.023
Anywhere.

39:35.356 --> 39:37.000
Oh, my God.

39:37.024 --> 39:38.435
Roger.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.704
Are you okay?

39:40.728 --> 39:42.105
You ay?

39:42.129 --> 39:43.440
Hey. I'm fine.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.275
I need you to do me a favor.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.044
- Reach into my pants.
- No, no, Roger.

39:47.068 --> 39:49.012
Roger. I'm sorry, he's delirious. Roger.

39:49.036 --> 39:51.040
I need you to grab my wire. The wire.

39:51.064 --> 39:52.916
Roger. Roger, this is not
the time for that.

39:52.940 --> 39:55.319
- I got Barnes on tape.
- Roger.

39:55.343 --> 39:57.287
- Here, I got Barnes on tape.
- What?

39:57.311 --> 39:58.822
I-It'll exonerate Cole.

39:58.846 --> 40:00.223
Get, get it to Avery.

40:00.247 --> 40:02.926
But, wait, please.

40:02.950 --> 40:04.010
Uh...

40:05.598 --> 40:07.243
You promise me.

40:07.964 --> 40:09.433
You promise me you'll come back to me.

40:09.650 --> 40:11.068
I promise.

40:11.092 --> 40:13.904
- Ma'am, please. We have to go.
- Okay.

40:13.928 --> 40:15.405
Hurry.

40:24.705 --> 40:26.249
Rib time.

40:26.273 --> 40:27.984
Who's hungry?

40:28.008 --> 40:31.321
You barbecued ribs right after
being shot in the ribs?

40:31.345 --> 40:33.890
- Sort of a homage.
- Hmm.

40:33.914 --> 40:35.286
- I'll take that.
- No, I'll take it.

40:35.310 --> 40:36.644
N-No.

40:38.386 --> 40:40.864
- Whoa. Well, look who's back.
- Hi.

40:40.888 --> 40:42.933
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

40:42.957 --> 40:44.317
All right, we're gonna get some food.

40:44.342 --> 40:45.710
- We'll see you in a second.
- Yeah.

40:45.734 --> 40:46.830
Well, well, well.

40:46.854 --> 40:49.172
The spy has come in from the cold.

40:49.196 --> 40:51.570
Yeah, about that.

40:51.594 --> 40:53.217
I want to thank you guys.

40:53.241 --> 40:54.745
For what?

40:55.342 --> 40:56.852
You know.

40:56.877 --> 40:58.143
For the money.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.618
- I'll see-see you around, Cole.
- I don't know what you mean.

41:01.642 --> 41:03.278
At all. So...

41:07.248 --> 41:08.859
Welcome to the family.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.867
Up and grilling already.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.357
Good to see you healthy.

41:23.256 --> 41:25.008
You know, look, Roger, I...

41:25.032 --> 41:26.443
never had a partner before.

41:27.468 --> 41:28.678
Don't really know how to thank somebody

41:28.702 --> 41:30.046
for taking a bullet for me.

41:30.388 --> 41:31.882
Well...

41:31.906 --> 41:33.550
I think you just did.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.652
So, uh...

41:35.676 --> 41:38.488
seems like Barnes just kind of up and...

41:38.512 --> 41:40.390
disappeared into thin air, huh?

41:40.414 --> 41:41.758
Not so thin, actually.

41:42.317 --> 41:43.927
An old contact got in touch.

41:43.951 --> 41:45.829
A Barnes alias pinged in Ecuador.

41:45.853 --> 41:47.155
Hmm.

41:48.948 --> 41:50.576
So you gonna go after him?

41:50.600 --> 41:52.302
The old me would already be on a plane.

41:52.326 --> 41:54.579
Right. And the new you?

41:58.625 --> 41:59.998
Is happy where he's at.

42:01.210 --> 42:02.746
I'm a family man now.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.114
Good.

42:04.646 --> 42:06.257
I'm glad to hear it.

42:06.282 --> 42:07.951
I mean, who cares if Barnes gets away?

42:08.651 --> 42:10.053
I can live with that.

42:10.077 --> 42:12.989
Right? So-so what if he shot me?

42:13.322 --> 42:14.791
I'm not the travel guy.

42:15.381 --> 42:16.825
I'm the steady guy.

42:16.850 --> 42:20.430
The... "stay put" guy.

42:20.454 --> 42:22.532
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

42:23.463 --> 42:24.873
Glad we're on the same page.

42:24.898 --> 42:26.164
Same page.

42:28.829 --> 42:31.685
Oh, my gosh, I cannot believe
we are doing this.

42:31.709 --> 42:33.634
- Right?
- A spontaneous trip

42:33.659 --> 42:34.838
to South America? Hi.

42:34.862 --> 42:38.014
Well, I had about, uh, 30 years of, uh,

42:38.038 --> 42:40.684
vacation days,
so I figured, you know what?

42:40.708 --> 42:42.452
Better now than never.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.533
- Well, I like the new Roger.
- Yes.

42:44.557 --> 42:45.956
You know?

42:45.980 --> 42:48.198
Like, warm waters, sandy beaches, just...

42:48.222 --> 42:50.427
- Yep.
- ...you, me and...

42:50.451 --> 42:52.095
- Cole?
- Oh, my gosh.

42:52.119 --> 42:54.631
- Hi, hi.
- Natalie. Hey.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.000
- What the hell are you doing here?
- How are you?

42:57.024 --> 42:59.827
Romantic getaway. Scuba diving. You?

42:59.851 --> 43:02.472
Uh, fishing. I like the bass.

43:02.496 --> 43:07.077
You both planned
and booked trips to Ecuador?

43:07.870 --> 43:09.312
Small world.

43:09.336 --> 43:13.024
- Tiny.
- Miniscule. Hmm.

43:13.658 --> 43:14.776
Hmm.

43:14.801 --> 43:16.634
Mm-hmm.

43:18.445 --> 43:20.390
This isn't a vacation, is it?

43:20.414 --> 43:22.057
Never is.

43:22.081 --> 43:23.894
Uh...

43:23.918 --> 43:26.863
You can't put your seat back
before takeoff.

43:26.887 --> 43:28.231
It's squeezing my knees.

43:28.255 --> 43:29.599
Yeah, I'm not putting my seat back.

43:29.623 --> 43:31.268
Then it must be broken, I mean...

43:31.292 --> 43:33.069
- I tell you what, switch with me.
- No.

43:33.093 --> 43:34.504
Then I won't have any legroom.

43:34.528 --> 43:36.740
Look, I don't want to have to go there,

43:36.764 --> 43:38.675
but you said you owed me one.

43:38.699 --> 43:41.011
- For taking...
- That was a figure of speech.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.712
I'm not gonna change seats
on a 12-hour flight.

43:42.736 --> 43:44.897
- Baby, I'm not gonna make it.
- Oh...

43:45.559 --> 43:46.692
Excuse me.

43:46.692 --> 43:48.692
Can I have a glass of wine?

43:48.825 --> 43:49.904
Make it two?

43:49.931 --> 43:51.424
- Or make it to bubbles.
- Two

43:51.464 --> 43:53.464
- Two vodkas.
- It's that a cuisine in first class?
