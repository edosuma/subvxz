the smallest division

of the US Military,

lighthouses and buoys

03:27.373 --> 03:29.709

right here.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.911
Every two to three years,

03:31.911 --> 03:34.113
these massive buoys have to be

03:34.113 --> 03:36.215
pulled out of the ocean
for maintenance.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.585

03:45.124 --> 03:47.594

back here.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.162
You can see that these buoys

03:49.162 --> 03:51.397
have already been
cleaned off and repainted,

03:51.397 --> 03:52.732

03:52.732 --> 03:56.469
by replacing all the old chain
with new ones.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.550
to get these buoys ready
to go back into the ocean.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.653
Start by grinding off
the old bridle assembly

04:13.653 --> 04:16.456
and the two shots of chain
attached to the anchor.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.857
Then replace the bridle
with a new one,

04:17.857 --> 04:20.693
along with
two new shots of chain.

04:20.693 --> 04:23.429
Each shot of chain
weighs 2,000 pounds.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.965
And you have to drag
a total of four shots

04:25.965 --> 04:29.002
across the dock to your buoys
to get the job done.

04:29.002 --> 04:32.105
You must connect two shots
of chain to each buoy

04:32.105 --> 04:34.574
using a Coast Guard method
called "Heat and Beat."

04:36.643 --> 04:39.178
And don't forget to install
new solar-powered

04:39.178 --> 04:41.481
navigational lights
on each of your buoys.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.449
Once you've completed one buoy,

04:43.449 --> 04:45.852
do exactly the same thing
to your second buoy.

-KELSY: Yep. Sarah's strong.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.345
ALFIE:
Sarah is the crew boss today

05:12.345 --> 05:15.682
mainly because
she has a military background,

05:15.682 --> 05:17.250
so her discipline

05:17.250 --> 05:20.620
and her eight-year experience
brings a lot to the table.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.488
So we're confident

05:22.488 --> 05:25.725
that Sarah can dictate
a win for Savage Crew.

so they can attach it
to their buoy.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.067
-(groans)
-Not doing anything, Kelsy.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.435
-Got to stand three links apart.
-Okay.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.637
Pulling this chain is
extremely heavy.

08:24.637 --> 08:25.671
(grunting)

08:25.671 --> 08:26.706
It is literally dead weight.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.407
(groaning)

08:28.407 --> 08:32.011
KEOGHAN:
Tak and Lia have the
light up on the green buoy.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.282
Christine gets
a pin and shackle out.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.651
Hey, Chris! Take out the pin.

08:38.651 --> 08:41.354
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands finally get
their bridle assembly off

08:41.354 --> 08:42.488
their first buoy,

08:42.488 --> 08:44.857
but their anchor chain is
still attached.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.259
-We got to get this.
-Okay, come here.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.760
-Let's see if we can try it.
-Come here. Together.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.662
KEOGHAN: Sarah, getting
the light on for Savage Crew.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.063
MIKE:
All right, untangle it.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.231
-This all should be teamwork.
-SARAH: Talk to me,

08:52.231 --> 08:53.366
-where do you need me?
-KELSY: Teamwork.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.700
(overlapping chatter)

08:54.700 --> 08:56.035
ELIZABETH:
Three apart from each other.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.403
-Pull in an assembly line.
-MIKE: Yeah.

08:57.403 --> 09:00.439
-Go down, pull. Down, pull.
-Okay, yep.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.341
Elizabeth didn't hesitate,
and she said she got us,

09:02.341 --> 09:03.609
and we trusted her.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.279
And we're all gonna jump
on that chain

09:06.279 --> 09:08.781
and move
in an assembly-like motion.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.550
Watch out.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.453
I've never had to drag
a 2,000-pound chain around.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.088
Hey-- Whoa.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.690
KEOGHAN:
Whoa, and Alfie goes down.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.326
Get a forklift or something,
for God's sakes,

09:20.326 --> 09:22.662
but no, they're handing us
five hooks here

09:22.662 --> 09:24.030
and saying, "good luck."

09:25.564 --> 09:27.566
-Hanger, you got it.
-Watch yourself, Hanger.
-No, we're good. Go, go, go, go.

09:27.566 --> 09:30.136
Let's go, team.
I'll help you.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.174
KEOGHAN:
Christine finally
releasing the chain

09:35.174 --> 09:36.575
from Dirty Hands' anchor.

09:36.575 --> 09:39.378
As Quincey works to attach
the new bridle assembly

09:39.378 --> 09:40.947
on their buoy.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.315
You're still in this,
Dirty Hands.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.649
Now inchworm this one up.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.217
-One, two, three,
-KEOGHAN: Here they go.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.586
-four, five, stop.
-This is great technique
from Dirty Hands.

09:47.586 --> 09:48.955
KALIMBA:
My job as a firefighter has

09:48.955 --> 09:50.957
prepared me for this
because I am used to moving

09:50.957 --> 09:54.126
five-inch hose
which is super heavy,

09:54.126 --> 09:55.494
especially when it's charged.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.563
And we do have hose hooks
that are similar

09:57.563 --> 09:59.765
to the chain hooks that
we use to move the hose around.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.701
It's always easier
to inchworm or zigzag.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.202
Now we're cooking with fire.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.906
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew with a slight lead
at this point.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.708
Got to get those chains
over the red line

10:08.708 --> 10:10.109
before you connect them.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.545
KELSY:
Get it past the line.
We're good!

10:12.545 --> 10:14.814
Savage Crew
with both their shots of chain

10:14.814 --> 10:16.415
over the line
for their red buoy.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.819
Now they have to get the end of
this shot up onto the anchor.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.120
(grunting)

10:21.120 --> 10:22.722
Great work there
from Savage Crew.

10:22.722 --> 10:23.756
MIKE:
Good work, guys. Good work.

10:23.756 --> 10:24.890
We're doing good.
We're going good.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.392
KEOGHAN:
They're the first to attach

10:26.392 --> 10:27.526
a new anchor chain and bridle

10:27.526 --> 10:29.261
to their buoy.

10:29.261 --> 10:32.131
That heavy vise holds
the two shots of chain in place.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.167
Time to turn up the gas
for the "Heat and Beat."

10:35.167 --> 10:36.635
Fire coming. Fire coming.

10:36.635 --> 10:38.404
-Ready? Here we go.
-Go, go, go, go.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.806
At this point, Savage Crew,
hey, we're doing good.

10:40.806 --> 10:45.077
Alfie has so much experience
because he's a superintendent.

10:45.077 --> 10:48.314
All we have to do is wait
for Alfie to heat that up,

10:48.314 --> 10:51.317
so we can start making
what they call a mushroom

10:51.317 --> 10:52.585
with the hammers to make sure

10:52.585 --> 10:54.720
that this pin does not drop out,

10:54.720 --> 10:56.122
and we're looking good.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.657
-These ones good?
-We're good on this one.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.393
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands starting to catch up

11:00.393 --> 11:02.628
as they finish off their
new bridle and anchor chains.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.897
Savage Crew just slightly ahead
of Dirty Hands

11:04.897 --> 11:06.032
on the first buoy.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.401
Hanger is practicing
his hammering

11:08.401 --> 11:10.669
because he hasn't hammered
enough in his life.

11:10.669 --> 11:14.907
-Don't waste your energy.
-Dirty Hands watching
as Christine gets the heat on.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.575
LIA:
Doing good, Christine!

11:16.575 --> 11:19.378
KEOGHAN:
We've got acetylene gas
and oxygen coming through.

11:19.378 --> 11:23.182
It's up to each of the operators
to figure out what the mix is.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.917
Got to get that pin nice
and red hot,

11:24.917 --> 11:27.119
and then you can start
to hammer.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.257
Alfie's lost his flame.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.825
-KELSY: Light him,
light him, light him.
-MIKE: Light it again.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.966
KEOGHAN:
Alfie's having some trouble
with that acetylene torch.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.601
Take it easy.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.970
Relax, relax,
relax, relax, relax.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.239
You got it.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.708
ALFIE:
I know that Christine is burning
on the other side.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.211
Christine is a union ironworker.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.746
She is burning every day.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.449
And so, obviously,
that's in the back of my head.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.118
And just 'cause I know
how to do something

11:59.118 --> 12:01.987
doesn't mean that she's
not doing it better every day.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.756
All you now, Christine.
Let's go.

12:03.756 --> 12:04.924
The gas is working fine.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.192
They-they just don't know
how to burn them.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.560
I have so much faith
in Christine.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.563
She can do ironwork,
and she can use a torch.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.797
Christine, she's gonna
catch us up.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.566
(stammers) She gonna make
the difference up.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.936
KEOGHAN:
Christine looking super relaxed
in this job.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.571
You got this, guys.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.373
This is a dead-even race
at this point.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.008
Mike, do you want to jump
in there?

12:23.008 --> 12:25.744
He's got it, he's got it.
He's got it.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.013
Alfie, if you're not
comfortable, tell somebody.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.748
ALFIE:
It's not lighting.

12:36.789 --> 12:37.990
ALFIE:
It's not lighting.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.126
KEOGHAN: Savage Crew and
Dirty Hands racing

12:40.126 --> 12:42.595
to complete the "Heat and Beat"
on their first buoys.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.929
Both teams have attached

12:43.929 --> 12:45.865
their new anchor chains
and bridle assemblies.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.634
Now they've got to join those
two shots of chain together.

12:48.634 --> 12:49.902
It's all gonna come down to

12:49.902 --> 12:51.937
who can get these chains
connected first.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.039
-It's not flowing.
-It's not flowing.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.174
Turn it all the way off
and try again.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.742
ALFIE:
To light the torch,

12:56.742 --> 12:58.777
we have to have the right
mixture of gas and oxygen.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.346
And if I don't do this properly,

13:00.346 --> 13:03.449
and I don't heat it up
just right in the given time,

13:03.449 --> 13:04.750
it's my fault.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.352
Yeah, sit on them, Christine.
That's all right.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.255
KEOGHAN: Christine's trying to
get that pin nice and red hot.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.391
Finally, Alfie getting
his acetylene torch going.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.026
MIKE:
Good work, Alfie. Good work.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.995
KEOGHAN:
Christine and Alfie,
neck and neck.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.097
Who's gonna heat up
their pin first?

13:18.097 --> 13:19.532
The Coast Guard will
let them know

13:19.532 --> 13:21.066
when they can start beating down
on that pin.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.368
You can do the countdown.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.236
ALFIE:
Three, two, one.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.105
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew, the first to finish
heating their pin.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.306
Go.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.743
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands only seconds behind.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.811
-CHRISTINE: ...two, one.
-Now they can bring down
their hammers.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.180
Go!

13:34.180 --> 13:35.214
JEROME:
Hit 'em!

13:36.015 --> 13:37.783
Almost got it.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.452
Go. Go. Go. Go, yeah!

13:40.452 --> 13:41.787
Go! Smack her on the sides.

13:41.787 --> 13:42.955
Looks good.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.657
(overlapping shouting)

13:44.657 --> 13:46.926
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew have completed
their first buoy.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.394
-One to go.
-Go cut.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.564
-Good.
-We're good!

13:51.564 --> 13:53.866
KEOGHAN:
Both teams moving on
to their second buoy

13:53.866 --> 13:55.534
at exactly the same time.

13:55.534 --> 13:58.737
-(mechanical whirring)
-Everybody knows what to do now.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.005
This is rinse and repeat.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.274
The first team to get
the second buoy done

14:02.274 --> 14:04.977
wins $12,000.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.846
HANGER:
We understood what we had to do.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.615
And me, working around tools
for 31 years,

14:09.615 --> 14:13.252
I'm gonna make sure
I'm going to be fast.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.653
ELIZABETH:
This one's not even cut yet.

14:14.653 --> 14:15.688
-What?
-That's a new one.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.223
I come around the second buoy,

14:17.223 --> 14:18.991
and they've already got
the bridle hooked up.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.125
I-I couldn't even believe it.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.760
These-- Everybody's moving
so fast.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.696
We've got this.
I know we've got this.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.634
KEOGHAN: There goes Quincey
with a big pin hit.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.103
Releasing the old anchor chain
for Dirty Hands.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.371
Light coming down.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.607
KEOGHAN:
Tak and Lia have
the old light off,

14:34.607 --> 14:36.141
now they're working the new one.

14:36.141 --> 14:37.810
TAK:
Put the top one.
Put the top one first.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.312
LIA: Having two people work on
the light was advantageous

14:40.312 --> 14:43.148
because to be able to have
one person hold the light

14:43.148 --> 14:44.650
and then work on the bolts
together,

14:44.650 --> 14:45.951
I think it was key.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.152
KEOGHAN: Lia and Tak
have finished the light

14:47.152 --> 14:48.420
on their red and white buoy.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.522
Coming back down
to help their team.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.524
Dirty Hands,
done with their bridle assembly.

14:52.524 --> 14:53.792
Thank you,braddah.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.527
KEOGHAN: Sarah's back down,
having gotten

14:55.527 --> 14:57.663
the navigational light on
for Savage Crew.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.466
Now we have six
against six moving the chain.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.735
SARAH:
Let's go, where we at,
where we at? Right here?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.136
We got to work together.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.005
This is the race right here.
The chain.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.439
QUINCEY: Watch the footing,
watch the footing.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.075
I feel it in my arms.
I feel it in my biceps.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.477
I'm feeling it in my quads.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.978
It's burning,
but we got a job to do.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.481
We're determined
to even the score today.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.716
Both teams with their bridles
on their buoys.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.552
Both teams working on
their second shot of chains.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.288
Keep going, keep going.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.556
And both teams yet to do
the "Heat and Beat"

15:24.556 --> 15:26.959
and join these two shots
of chain together.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.094
HANGER:
Okay, we're over.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.996
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew have both shots
of their chain

15:30.996 --> 15:33.499
across the red line
and are now attaching

15:33.499 --> 15:35.067
one end of it to their anchor.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.702
JEROME:
One, two, three.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.504
Yeah, good. We're good.

15:38.504 --> 15:41.173
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands getting both their
shots of chain across the line.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.343
Alfie's already starting
to heat that pin.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.378
All we have to do is
wait for Alfie

15:46.378 --> 15:48.247
so we can start hitting it.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.915
KEOGHAN:
Christine's got the torch going.

15:49.915 --> 15:52.151
HANGER:
Dirty Hands is hungry.
They want this win.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.252
But we want it more.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.254
He knows how to do it.
He knows.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.289
♪ ♪

15:58.357 --> 15:59.692
You got it, Alfie.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.160
KEOGHAN:
Alfie's having trouble
lighting up.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.895
And Christine has not stopped.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.898
This is a repeat of where
we were with the first buoy.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.633

32:43.628 --> 32:46.264
to not only make the final three
but to win it.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.633
And I know my grandfather
believed in me,

32:48.633 --> 32:50.435
so I got to believe in me, too.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.403
-MIKE: Yeah.
-(clapping)

32:52.403 --> 32:55.873
LIA:
I really want to keep going
in the individual competition

32:55.873 --> 32:58.009
because if I stop now
I'm gonna miss out

32:58.009 --> 32:59.644
on all those other
little adventures.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.046
Most of the things I've
missed out on in that past

33:02.046 --> 33:04.449
was because we had
other responsibilities

33:04.449 --> 33:05.683
like taking care of mom.

33:05.683 --> 33:08.353
When she was sick,
my dad did the best he could

33:08.353 --> 33:10.855
to let us participate,
but sometimes you just couldn't.

33:10.855 --> 33:13.858
So I don't want to be pulled out
for that just yet.

33:13.858 --> 33:16.394
Welcome back to
Captain Starsinic's

33:16.394 --> 33:18.196
beautiful ship
on theGeorge Cobb.

33:18.196 --> 33:20.531
Thank you, Captain,
for having us back.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.101
Sarah, Lia,
you have a chance to hook,

33:23.101 --> 33:25.370
snag and pull your way back

33:25.370 --> 33:27.505
in to the individual
competition.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.307
Because for the job today,

33:29.307 --> 33:32.577
there are three green buoys
and there are three red ones.

33:32.577 --> 33:34.746
There's a little floater
attached to each of them.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.581
That is crucial
to getting the job done

33:36.581 --> 33:38.716
because you are going
to be using this line

33:38.716 --> 33:40.084
with the grapple on it
to hook them

33:40.084 --> 33:41.886
and pull them up onto the ship.

33:41.886 --> 33:44.555
First of you to get
all three buoys and anchors

33:44.555 --> 33:47.125
into the locker box
will be safe.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.227
If you're last,
you will be punching out.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.528
So, we're not getting
in the water?

33:50.528 --> 33:52.363
Sarah, you do not need to get
in the water.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.866
-(laughter)
-How do you feel about that?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.834
-Good to go.
-Smiling already.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.437
-That's great.
-Life jackets on,
let's get to work.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.506
SARAH:
I have experience
knowing how to focus

34:01.506 --> 34:03.875
on a target,
and I'm hoping that

34:03.875 --> 34:05.676
that plays to my advantage,

34:05.676 --> 34:08.546
but Lia also has experience
with the military,

34:08.546 --> 34:10.281
so I can't sleep on her at all.

34:10.281 --> 34:12.083

On the ship's work whistle.

-KELSY: Come on, guys.
-KEOGHAN: Two factors--

34:18.723 --> 34:20.224
one is the skill factor,

34:20.224 --> 34:22.927
the second is
the strength factor.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.029
LIA:
I've thrown a grappling hook
or two,

34:25.029 --> 34:28.032
but just up a tree to a branch
to climb up or something.

34:28.032 --> 34:30.535
There's a whole new pressure
when you have ten folks

34:30.535 --> 34:33.871
cheering for you
and somebody equally capable

34:33.871 --> 34:36.941
right beside you
doing the same thing.

be focusing on what I'm doing.

34:51.689 --> 34:55.059
I want to perfect how
I'm actually getting the buoy

34:55.059 --> 34:57.161
so that I'm able to repeat it
on a second and third buoy.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.032
(cheering)

35:01.032 --> 35:03.434
Whoa,
Sarah gets her grapple on.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.636
Now can Sarah catch up?
