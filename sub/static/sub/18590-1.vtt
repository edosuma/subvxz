04:59.557 --> 05:02.852
- Good morning, Nancy.
- Good morning.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.874
Man walking.

05:41.891 --> 05:44.894
Put your left hand on top of your head.

05:48.439 --> 05:51.234
Now the other one.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.919
In the years since
my client's incarceration...

06:10.128 --> 06:13.339
A 12-year sentence for manslaughter
during a bank robbery.

06:13.464 --> 06:17.510
In the years since
Michael Bosworth's incarceration,

06:17.635 --> 06:21.681
he's completed the Johns Hopkins
creative writing workshop.

06:21.806 --> 06:26.920
In addition, I present the court
two letters of character reference

06:27.020 --> 06:29.005
from nationally known authors.

06:29.105 --> 06:33.776
I'll produce transcripts from the mothers
of two men he shot down in the past.

06:33.901 --> 06:39.849
I'll also point out that Michael Bosworth's
IQ has been measured above 130.

06:39.949 --> 06:44.120
The prosecution concedes that
Michael Bosworth is very intelligent.

06:44.329 --> 06:46.940
But we also know
he always reverts to violence.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.525
The charge before the court
is attempted murder.

06:49.625 --> 06:56.015
It defies all reason that Bosworth
would jeopardise a flawless prison record

06:56.115 --> 06:57.967
by attacking a guard...

06:58.092 --> 07:00.887
I'm not a case history.

07:01.137 --> 07:05.183
The defendant will speak
only when spoken to.

07:05.308 --> 07:08.519
Bailiffs, sit this man down.

07:08.645 --> 07:12.048
I'm just pro bono work
for her rich daddy's law firm.

07:12.148 --> 07:14.651
Bailiffs, sit the man down.

07:14.776 --> 07:18.304
I wanna go pro per.
I demand to represent myself.

07:18.404 --> 07:21.240
My life is in jeopardy
from every guard in that prison.

07:21.449 --> 07:28.731
And Nancy Breyers' defence is trivial,
unsuitable, weak and defeatist.

07:28.831 --> 07:33.653
Mr Bosworth, if necessary,
I will have you gagged and bound.

07:33.753 --> 07:37.590
Ms Breyers has represented you
diligently these past weeks.

07:37.715 --> 07:43.012
You are fighting for your life.
You may not go pro per.

07:43.137 --> 07:47.183
Your Honour, may I be permitted
to confer with my client in private?

07:47.308 --> 07:51.170
I got nothing to say to you.

07:51.270 --> 07:55.441
- Permission granted.
- I got nothing to say.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.278
Man walking.

07:59.404 --> 08:03.032
- I'm gonna grab a sandwich.
- You got it.

08:04.409 --> 08:06.703
Stand right here.

08:10.540 --> 08:12.542
Ma'am.

08:13.793 --> 08:17.338
Hold it right there, buddy.
You stay here.

08:20.049 --> 08:27.473
I am trying to think what more I can do
to convince you of my competence.

08:27.974 --> 08:32.227
Please, I worked very hard to help you.

08:32.352 --> 08:35.815
Please, I've worked very hard.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.726
Relax, cowboy.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.329
Hook him up. Hook him up.

08:55.084 --> 09:00.423
Better do what he says.
Please put your hands behind your back.

09:07.805 --> 09:10.099
Son of a bitch.

09:25.948 --> 09:30.620
Whatever I do,
it's only because I need you.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.790
- Say you need me.
- I need you.

09:37.627 --> 09:41.673
- I want you to act scared of me.
- I am scared of you.

10:07.657 --> 10:10.159
- I knew something'd go wrong.
- You got no faith.

10:32.765 --> 10:36.519
Nancy. Hi. I thought you were
supposed to be in court this morning.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.564
I gotta get going.

10:45.528 --> 10:48.865
I'll wait for you...
Open your eyes and look at me!

10:49.032 --> 10:52.577
I'll wait for you as long as it takes.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.915
Nancy! Nancy!

10:58.124 --> 11:01.794
My brother knows what he's doing.
Open the door!

11:03.546 --> 11:05.632
- Where's the lawyer?
- Get outta here!

11:06.466 --> 11:09.093
Nancy, are you OK?

12:02.855 --> 12:07.026
- Daddy!
- Hey, Zack. How you doin'?

12:07.151 --> 12:08.695
- OK.
- Is Mom in?

12:08.945 --> 12:10.613
Come and see Mommy.

12:17.161 --> 12:20.607
- Hey, Mom! It's Daddy.
- What are you doing in shorts?

12:20.707 --> 12:23.418
It's almost winter.
Go up and get changed.

12:24.669 --> 12:29.048
You're not supposed
to be here till this afternoon.

12:30.216 --> 12:31.134
Hey.

12:31.342 --> 12:35.705
I'm surprised you guys
are talking to each other.

12:35.805 --> 12:39.375
I love your hair like that.
It's beautiful when you wear it that way.

12:39.475 --> 12:42.603
- Come on.
- I'm late.

12:44.564 --> 12:49.485
Mom, Kyle will be driving me
to riding class after school.

12:54.824 --> 12:58.328
If it makes you feel better,
she's harder on me when we're alone.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.581
Hey, come here. I want to talk to you.

13:08.171 --> 13:10.840
She still going out with Kyle?

13:13.259 --> 13:15.345
Nora?

13:18.056 --> 13:20.141
Nora?

13:22.644 --> 13:24.604
I never liked that kid.

13:24.854 --> 13:28.274
Kids his age are supposed
to be cocky, full of life.

13:28.483 --> 13:30.860
You know what I mean?

13:31.110 --> 13:35.865
- Trouble is, Kyle thinks too much.
- We can't all be full of surprises like you.

13:35.990 --> 13:39.619
Kyle's reliable.
She says if she marries him,

13:39.744 --> 13:44.524
she won't have to worry about him
running off with some female half his age.

13:44.624 --> 13:49.754
- Of course, I'm only quoting.
- That is not fair, Nora.

13:49.879 --> 13:54.133
- OK, so Karen is 24 years old. So what?
- Fair?

13:54.342 --> 13:57.453
Is that what you still think
life has to be, Tim? Fair?

13:57.553 --> 14:00.181
Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna grow up?

14:00.306 --> 14:02.809
I am trying.

14:02.976 --> 14:07.146
I came to tell you that Karen is over.
I've broken up with her.

14:07.397 --> 14:11.234
Poor baby. Abandoned at her tender age.

14:12.402 --> 14:15.905
- I came hoping to talk with you.
- What are we doing, wrestling?

14:16.155 --> 14:18.408
You're never here when I pick up Zack.

14:18.533 --> 14:20.618
We have nothing more
to say to each other.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.663
You wanna talk to me, talk.
Then leave me alone.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.834
- They're at it again.
- Go put on your pants, OK?

14:28.001 --> 14:30.753
Do you need any money?
Anything you and the kids need?

14:30.920 --> 14:33.965
- Please, Tim, not that!
- What do you want?

14:34.173 --> 14:36.467
What I have always wanted.

14:36.592 --> 14:40.096
Somebody I can trust.
Somebody I can depend on.

14:40.221 --> 14:42.415
Not you.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.518
I do want to tell you one thing.
I figured it out.

14:45.643 --> 14:48.563
I took up with Karen
because she wasn't you.

14:48.771 --> 14:51.174
Even dumb me figured that one out.

14:51.274 --> 14:54.277
Now I've broken it up with her
because she wasn't like you.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.904
I can't believe anything you say, Tim.

14:57.113 --> 15:01.617
I don't blame you.
Are you sure you want to sell the house?

15:01.784 --> 15:07.040
The kids are settled here, and
all the work you've put in and everything.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.126
OK, I'm sorry.

15:11.919 --> 15:14.614
Too many bad memories, huh?

15:14.714 --> 15:17.634
- And good ones.
- Good.

15:20.386 --> 15:25.041
One thing you've gotta believe, Nora.
I never wanted to hurt you.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.477
You struck out there.

15:33.316 --> 15:35.693
Hey, Zack, come on, let's go!

15:39.322 --> 15:42.058
- Zack.
- There's a brontosaurus in the pool.

15:42.158 --> 15:46.412
No way. They've been extinct
for more than a million years.

15:46.537 --> 15:48.498
How about a kiss?

15:51.959 --> 15:56.130
Don't forget to tell your English teacher
the difference between "lie" and "lay".

15:56.255 --> 15:59.884
- She'll flunk me for being a smart-ass.
- I doubt it.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.329
Can I get a kiss? Just a friendly kiss?

16:03.429 --> 16:05.848
Bye-bye, Mom. See you later.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.671
- I'll call this afternoon. Will you be here?
- I don't think so.

16:11.771 --> 16:16.259
- I'll leave a key under the mat.
- You take care, now.

16:16.359 --> 16:18.444
You too.

16:21.030 --> 16:23.032
You sure?

16:24.492 --> 16:26.452
Sorry.

16:33.876 --> 16:35.878
See you later.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.638
- Hey, young fella.
- Hi.

16:45.763 --> 16:47.957
- You wanna drive?
- It'd be great.

16:48.057 --> 16:50.351
- Move over.
- All right.

16:53.688 --> 16:56.899
- Go on.
- Come on, Dad. Come on.

16:57.025 --> 17:01.404
- Let's go.
- Bye, Mom! Bye! Bye, Mommy!

17:19.839 --> 17:21.924
Now what?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.928
Are you gonna take a swim?

17:28.013 --> 17:31.517
I don't get it.
Won't the cops be looking for the car?

17:31.768 --> 17:36.105
So they will, Albert, so they will.
But not this one.

17:37.607 --> 17:42.070
- Feast your eyes, boys.
- It's a Jaguar.

17:42.278 --> 17:46.032
- We're gonna steal a Jaguar?
- Where did you get the keys?

17:46.240 --> 17:49.035
You know who God helps,
don't you, brother?

17:49.160 --> 17:55.500
- I never even rode in a Jaguar before.
- Hey, I told you. That's my brother.

17:56.542 --> 18:00.129
- Mike, can I drive?
- Sure, you can drive.

18:00.838 --> 18:05.718
You can drive that beat-up old Cougar
right into the lake.

18:14.602 --> 18:16.354
Take this!

18:17.814 --> 18:21.801
- Albert, can you whistle?
- Sure.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.970
I want you to whistle so I can hear you.

18:24.070 --> 18:29.909
I don't want you to stop unless you see
somebody comin' down the road.

18:39.002 --> 18:41.713
Hey, Albert!

18:41.838 --> 18:45.341
Move the goddamn log out of the way!

19:04.652 --> 19:07.071
Geronimo!

19:10.283 --> 19:14.871
Whoo! Mikey! Whoo! Mikey!

19:16.039 --> 19:18.833
Mikey! Mikey!

19:24.464 --> 19:27.717
She's good. She's real good.

19:29.260 --> 19:33.206
You gotta hand it to her...
she's holdin' up real well.

19:33.306 --> 19:37.060
And I hate playing
good cop, bad cop. It's bullshit.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.270
I was too hard on her.

19:41.856 --> 19:44.592
The lady is a liar. Among other things.

19:44.692 --> 19:47.720
- How do you get that?
- I've got a feeling.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.889
Call it women's intuition.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.617
- Bob? Bob?
- Yeah?

19:52.742 --> 19:56.896
This is Carl Ornitz from the US Attorney's
office. He has some news for us.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.249
Not news for the good of mankind,
I assume.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.919
When Bosworth was originally prosecuted,

20:03.169 --> 20:07.340
a significant part of the government's
case was excluded from the trial

20:07.548 --> 20:10.134
because of an inadmissible confession.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.137
When he was being pursued
he broke into a liquor store.

20:13.262 --> 20:18.476
He wanted to take the clerk with him.
The owner resisted. He was found shot.

20:18.601 --> 20:21.104
A couple of weeks later,
Bosworth was arrested.

20:21.270 --> 20:24.857
He confessed to the crime
before he was read his rights.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.527
We think he confessed on purpose.

20:27.735 --> 20:32.557
He was never tried for murder,
only for armed robbery.

20:32.657 --> 20:36.285
The thing is he had a prior conviction
for burglary. The people were at home.

20:36.411 --> 20:38.079
- He held 'em hostage...
- And?

20:38.287 --> 20:42.025
- And, as usual, somebody got dead.
- Are you gonna file on her?

20:42.125 --> 20:44.877
Better. I'm lettin' her go.

20:45.086 --> 20:48.298
What are you talking about?
I haven't even done my affidavit yet.

20:48.506 --> 20:51.009
Let's get a Title-3 for her phone.

20:51.134 --> 20:55.179
Evidence won't help us with this lady,
even if we had cold proof.

20:55.305 --> 20:59.684
Even if that marshal recovers, she'd waltz
into court and say she was mesmerised.

20:59.892 --> 21:03.187
"He made me do it." Temporary insanity.

21:03.313 --> 21:07.692
Look at her. She's too smart.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.820
I want her to be free as a kite.

21:11.029 --> 21:14.657
I want her to go to him
because she wants him.

21:17.493 --> 21:20.330
Then we'll take the lovebirds together.

21:25.084 --> 21:30.423
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.

21:32.300 --> 21:36.346
I liked the one with the swimming pool.
That's pretty nice.

21:36.471 --> 21:39.932
I think we should get
the hell outta here.

23:16.571 --> 23:18.656
Son of a bitch.

23:30.627 --> 23:34.797
Yeah, my heating has gone.
My house was freezing last night.

23:34.922 --> 23:38.968
- What's the address again?
- 1448 Whitney Drive.

23:39.093 --> 23:42.305
- When can you get someone out here?
- We're really backed up.

23:42.430 --> 23:45.041
We'll get someone out there
as soon as we can.

23:45.141 --> 23:49.395
Is that soon as in "real soon",
or soon as in "whenever we feel like it"?

23:49.520 --> 23:52.215
Do I put it on the radio or not?

23:52.315 --> 23:57.236
Yeah. OK, just get somebody
out here, please. Thank you.

23:59.113 --> 24:00.907
Calm.

24:09.332 --> 24:12.652
Good morning. You called about
a winter cover for your pool?

24:12.752 --> 24:17.256
What? No, I'm sorry. This house is sold.

24:17.465 --> 24:19.842
Unless my husband may have called.

24:20.093 --> 24:25.598
- Yes, it was your husband.
- But, no. He'd have told me about this.

24:31.938 --> 24:38.011
If you scream, your children will come
home and find you in a pool of blood.

24:38.111 --> 24:41.114
Please, what do you want?

24:41.239 --> 24:46.244
Hey, there's a swimming pool
in the back. And it's heated.

24:48.121 --> 24:51.958
- Someone left a bikini on the grass.
- That's my daughter's.

24:52.083 --> 24:55.128
Oh, yeah? How old? Is she cute?

24:58.965 --> 25:01.551
Keys to the station wagon?

25:01.676 --> 25:06.264
- The keys?
- I can help you. You're scared now.

25:07.390 --> 25:11.811
The fear will pass.
You'll feel proud of yourself.

25:12.937 --> 25:15.148
And I'll feel proud of you.

25:17.734 --> 25:19.819
The keys.

25:45.887 --> 25:47.972
No one's gonna hurt you.

25:48.097 --> 25:50.183
I promise.

25:53.102 --> 25:56.022
OK? You're gonna learn to trust me.

25:56.856 --> 26:00.485
You probably can't absorb
any of this right now.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.529
But you and I are gonna be friends.

26:07.575 --> 26:12.038
Would you like to go upstairs
and put something else on?

27:06.092 --> 27:09.095
Albert! What are you doing up there?

27:22.859 --> 27:26.930
Albert, were you in Nora's bedroom?

27:27.030 --> 27:30.700
You are never to enter that bedroom
without Nora's permission.

27:30.867 --> 27:33.603
I parked the Jag in the garage.

27:33.703 --> 27:36.706
Let's just take the car and go.
I don't like it here.

27:36.831 --> 27:39.042
Then you leave.

27:39.208 --> 27:44.756
You're only here because when I was
in prison, my brother needed your help.

27:44.964 --> 27:49.118
I want you to go through the house.
Look for money and jewellery.

27:49.218 --> 27:53.389
Nora, sit down. Sit down.
I wanna reassure you.

27:58.394 --> 28:01.314
- You have a daughter, May?
- How did you know her name?

28:01.564 --> 28:06.444
I was going through
your husband's letters, and... She's 15.

28:06.653 --> 28:10.306
- Then there's the younger child.
- Zack, he's...

28:10.406 --> 28:15.203
He's eight? They come home
from school around what time?

28:16.871 --> 28:21.651
Nora, don't make me resent the kids
before I even meet them.

28:21.751 --> 28:24.253
Zack gets dropped off around three.

28:24.379 --> 28:27.173
- By a carpool?
- Yes.

28:27.423 --> 28:30.635
Does the parent come to the door?

28:30.760 --> 28:34.806
No. Picking the children up is hectic
enough without dropping them off.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.016
Give me a break, lady.

28:37.725 --> 28:41.170
Do you think you could
speak on the telephone without crying?

28:41.270 --> 28:44.399
If you can, we can be outta here
a hell of a lot faster.

28:44.607 --> 28:49.512
- Yes, anything.
- You're a strong woman, Nora.

28:49.612 --> 28:53.866
- Smart men love strong women.
- What if they tap Nancy's phone?

28:53.992 --> 28:56.786
She's a victim.
They'd never suspect her.

28:56.911 --> 28:59.122
I'm a very fair man, Nora.

29:00.373 --> 29:03.584
I'd never hurt anyone
unless they were trying to hurt me.

29:03.793 --> 29:05.862
I swear it.

29:05.962 --> 29:08.281
Here's what I want you to say:

29:08.381 --> 29:13.286
"Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.
Just called to gossip. Nothing important."

29:13.386 --> 29:17.874
And I want you to leave her
this number. All right?

29:17.974 --> 29:20.685
Now you try it.

29:20.810 --> 29:23.396
Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.

29:23.604 --> 29:28.401
- Just nothing important. Just called...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:28.609 --> 29:33.323
I want you to smile.
OK, there. That's it. Big smile.

29:33.489 --> 29:35.992
You've got a beautiful smile.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.202
You try it.

29:40.413 --> 29:42.373
Smile.

29:48.504 --> 29:52.800
Hi, this is Nancy. Please leave
your message after the beep.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.828
Hi, Nancy. It's Nora.

29:55.928 --> 29:59.265
Nothing important.
Just called to say hi.

29:59.474 --> 30:04.687
Call me back at 555-4810.

30:04.896 --> 30:06.773
Bye.

30:06.981 --> 30:08.941
Good girl.

31:11.004 --> 31:13.923
Nora! Nora!

31:20.179 --> 31:22.248
Come on, open up, Nora.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.434
Open the door.

31:24.559 --> 31:27.061
Come on. I want to apologise.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.273
I'll camp outside.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.777
I once waited in line two days.

31:34.986 --> 31:37.613
Tickets for the World Series,
so I mean business.

31:37.780 --> 31:41.351
Open up! I'm gonna break in,
like the big, bad wolf.

31:41.451 --> 31:43.202
Nora!

31:43.328 --> 31:45.288
I'm not gonna ask again.

31:45.538 --> 31:47.624
Open up!

31:47.790 --> 31:50.001
Hey! Anyone home?

31:57.634 --> 31:59.369
Nora?

31:59.469 --> 32:03.473
Hey. I wanna apologise for this morning.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.106
- Tim!
- No! No!

32:13.650 --> 32:15.860
Enough! Enough!

32:19.197 --> 32:22.116
- He was gonna use it on me!
- Enough!

32:22.241 --> 32:27.413
- Albert, you're frightening Nora.
- I don't give a shit.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.652
Everything's under control.

32:32.752 --> 32:35.588
Timmy's got the idea.

32:35.755 --> 32:39.634
- He's gonna do exactly as we say.
- Are you gonna be all right?

32:39.842 --> 32:42.136
What the fuck is going on?
Who are these guys?

32:42.345 --> 32:46.599
He's gonna be just fine,
as soon as he figures out the rules.

32:46.724 --> 32:48.810
Here's $500.

32:50.687 --> 32:54.649
MasterCard. Visa. Take it. Take it all.

32:57.568 --> 33:02.782
Are you considering the options now?
Force? Negotiation?

33:03.700 --> 33:06.436
Maybe a little psychology?

33:06.536 --> 33:10.373
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting for my fiancée.

33:10.498 --> 33:13.109
I just want a place to relax.

33:13.209 --> 33:17.588
- What if the police followed you?
- I won't lie to you.

33:17.714 --> 33:20.633
If they touch me, they touch you.

33:21.551 --> 33:25.288
- Why here? Why my house?
- Fate.

33:25.388 --> 33:29.976
Besides, this isn't your house any longer.
I saw a "for sale" sign out front.

33:30.101 --> 33:33.213
- There's a kid out there.
- "For sale" is a trouble sign.

33:33.313 --> 33:36.482
We can leave now. Take me as a hostage.

33:39.277 --> 33:43.448
- You think before you act.
- Mom, I'm hungry!

33:56.377 --> 34:00.131
Hit him. You want to beat Tyson?

34:00.340 --> 34:04.177
- Yeah.
- Duck and hit from the same side he did.

34:04.302 --> 34:06.804
I'm not even past Bald Bull.

34:08.348 --> 34:12.835
When you get your start button,
use it as soon as you get it.

34:12.935 --> 34:15.563
Hey, Zack, what's goin' on?

34:17.940 --> 34:22.527
- Mom? Mommy!
- Don't ever touch my kid!

34:22.779 --> 34:25.348
- Mommy!
- Zack.

34:25.447 --> 34:29.034
Let's all relax. I got
some questions I want answers to.

34:29.202 --> 34:32.789
- Do you have a gun in the house?
- It's not safe with the kids around.

34:32.956 --> 34:36.708
You're not around here
to protect Nora any longer.

34:36.833 --> 34:39.862
Did you get a gun when Timmy left?

34:39.963 --> 34:42.799
No guns.

34:44.050 --> 34:49.472
So, is there any chance that anyone
from your office would be stopping by?

34:50.598 --> 34:54.643
What does a man like you
do to have all this?

34:56.312 --> 35:00.608
I was a corporate lawyer, but I quit
so I could defend psychopaths like you.

35:00.733 --> 35:05.488
Wally, I want you to take the brat
into the other room. Now.

35:05.738 --> 35:09.058
- What are they gonna do to me?
- It's OK. We'll play some TV.

35:09.158 --> 35:11.577
I won't hurt him. It's OK.

35:14.497 --> 35:16.749
- Move it, Wally.
- Mommy!

35:18.668 --> 35:20.336
It'll be OK.

35:20.503 --> 35:23.423
You were once a successful lawyer
and you gave it all up

35:23.673 --> 35:27.176
to work for something more meaningful?

35:27.302 --> 35:30.930
- Gee, why did you do that?
- You wanna know the truth?

35:31.180 --> 35:35.835
I watched too many Westerns.
I wanted to be the sheriff.

35:35.935 --> 35:39.689
Nora, what did you have
prepared for dinner?

35:39.939 --> 35:42.025
I have a turkey. Anything else you want?

35:42.191 --> 35:49.933
I'd like to wash. Nora, you don't suppose
Timmy has any fresh shirts in the closet?

35:50.033 --> 35:52.035
I like to dress for dinner.

35:53.995 --> 35:58.458
- How did he talk you into this, Wally?
- Nobody talked me into nothing.

35:58.583 --> 36:02.754
Really? Seems to me
you're in deep shit, kid.

36:12.472 --> 36:18.294
A man is not a gentleman unless
he knows how to mix a proper martini,

36:18.394 --> 36:20.480
or tie a proper bow tie.

36:21.314 --> 36:24.859
Hi, Nancy. It's Nora. Nothing important.

36:25.068 --> 36:29.656
Just called to say hi.
Call me back at 555-4810.

36:29.864 --> 36:32.367
555-4810.

37:04.691 --> 37:09.070
- Where's the heat in this place?
- It doesn't work.

37:15.618 --> 37:19.789
Better be careful
with these things, Sheriff.

37:19.914 --> 37:21.874
You could get yourself hurt.

37:44.731 --> 37:48.818
Shouldn't your girlfriend
have called by now?

37:50.153 --> 37:52.739
And yours?

37:52.864 --> 37:55.575
Mike! Michael, it's the news!

38:10.089 --> 38:12.675
Attorney Nancy Breyers
says it's a miracle

38:12.884 --> 38:15.495
escaped killer Michael Bosworth
did not kill her.

38:15.595 --> 38:19.432
- Police report she's cooperating...
- I knew we should get out of here.

38:19.682 --> 38:24.020
She's cooperating.
I told you she would do that.

38:24.270 --> 38:27.774
- You heard that, right?
- Now for the latest weather...

38:27.899 --> 38:30.927
You're as thick as two bricks.

38:31.027 --> 38:33.196
Don't you see that
the more she cooperates

38:33.321 --> 38:36.432
the more they're going to
think she's a victim?

38:36.532 --> 38:39.994
Will you do me a favour, Wally?

38:40.119 --> 38:43.831
- Don't think.
- Don't talk to me like Albert.

38:43.957 --> 38:46.359
- I'm your brother.
- Right, come here.

38:46.459 --> 38:51.865
Don't you understand, huh?
Listen to me. Look at me.

38:51.965 --> 38:56.786
I love her. She's the only person
that I'd die for.

38:56.886 --> 39:00.765
Now you get it together.

39:16.990 --> 39:19.909
- Look at you. You're blushing.
- Is he gonna come in?

39:20.159 --> 39:22.120
He never does.

39:22.328 --> 39:25.665
- She's some piece of work.
- Don't hurt her. Don't let him.

39:25.873 --> 39:27.859
I didn't mean any disrespect.

39:27.959 --> 39:30.670
I would never hurt
your daughter, or any girl.

39:30.878 --> 39:36.092
That's the old spirit, Tim.
Take it all the way. Come on.

39:47.020 --> 39:51.316
If that kid comes in here,
I'm gonna start with you.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.532
Hi, Kyle. Hi, honey.

39:59.782 --> 40:02.577
- Daddy, hi.
- Hi.

40:02.785 --> 40:06.122
- You mad at me?
- Mad at you? No. I love you.

40:06.331 --> 40:08.291
I love you. Hey, you know what?

40:08.416 --> 40:12.879
Look, why don't I buy you guys dinner?
Just go and have some fun.

40:13.004 --> 40:16.633
Mom wants you to spend the weekend
with me. I'll see you over at my place.

40:16.758 --> 40:19.052
I can't. I work tonight, sir.

40:19.260 --> 40:23.723
Take the night off.
I'll pay double time. Go on, take it.

40:23.931 --> 40:26.643
Hey, May! May!

40:28.353 --> 40:30.521
May! Come back. May!

40:36.444 --> 40:39.405
There's nothing we can do, May.

40:46.996 --> 40:49.415
Give me back my Walkman.

41:00.343 --> 41:02.512
No!

41:04.514 --> 41:09.002
Easy, Albert! Easy, easy! Easy, Albert!

41:09.102 --> 41:11.688
- What?
- Easy.

41:11.813 --> 41:14.841
What the fuck is going on here?

41:14.941 --> 41:19.112
May, I'm getting really angry.

41:19.946 --> 41:22.657
You wanna point your gun at someone,
point it at me.

41:22.782 --> 41:27.120
- Wanna threaten someone? Threaten me.
- Sheriff, you just don't get it.

41:27.245 --> 41:30.373
May, listen to me. You do as they say.

41:30.581 --> 41:33.501
They're very dangerous.

41:35.795 --> 41:38.715
They're fucking idiots.

41:40.174 --> 41:42.677
- Stop it!
- No, Daddy!

41:44.220 --> 41:46.723
Albert, put him down.

41:46.973 --> 41:50.476
No! Daddy!

41:50.601 --> 41:52.895
Stop it!

41:58.526 --> 42:03.823
- It's not over.
- I promised Nora no one's gonna get hurt.

42:05.199 --> 42:08.202
Nora, please sit down.

42:08.453 --> 42:10.288
- Zack.
- Yes, Daddy?

42:10.830 --> 42:13.541
Now it's way past your bedtime.

42:13.666 --> 42:15.918
- OK, Daddy.
- Zack.

42:17.086 --> 42:20.949
- What?
- What do you wanna do?

42:21.049 --> 42:26.179
- I don't know. Play Nintendo, maybe.
- You're going to bed. We have rules.

42:26.346 --> 42:31.142
You're not giving the orders
in the house any more, Timmy.

42:31.392 --> 42:35.755
There's too many rules. Zack, go play.

42:35.855 --> 42:37.940
Live a little.

42:43.988 --> 42:47.617
- Good night, Mommy. I love you.
- I love you.

42:50.870 --> 42:55.249
- Daddy, don't let him hurt us.
- I know. Come on, come on.

42:55.375 --> 42:58.695
Be strong, kid. I'm proud of you.
You're gonna be fine.

42:58.795 --> 43:02.215
No, Daddy, please.
I don't want to go. I'm scared.

43:02.423 --> 43:05.134
You're gonna be fine. Come on.

43:05.259 --> 43:09.305
- Come on.
- OK.

43:09.430 --> 43:11.391
OK, OK.

43:12.350 --> 43:15.395
Hey, Zack, where you goin'?

43:15.561 --> 43:18.314
I'm goin' to bed!

43:20.566 --> 43:22.902
You live by too many rules.

43:25.697 --> 43:30.159
- I certainly feel sorry for Nora.
- Take your hands off her.

43:31.119 --> 43:33.496
- Is that another rule, Tim?
- You bet.

43:33.621 --> 43:38.501
There's a guy out there!
I think he's a plumber or something.

43:40.420 --> 43:45.300
From the heating company. Somebody
was supposed to come this morning.

43:45.508 --> 43:48.303
You get rid of 'em.

44:00.023 --> 44:05.111
- I called you this morning.
- You're my fifteenth service call today.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.305
You have to pay
whether I come in or not.

44:07.405 --> 44:14.604
- It's too late! My kids are already asleep.
- You still have to pay. $48,06.

44:14.704 --> 44:16.706
I have to get a cheque.

44:22.837 --> 44:25.632
48 bucks, for not doing a damn thing.

44:25.757 --> 44:30.762
That's why America's becoming a
second-rate country. I wouldn't pay him.

44:30.970 --> 44:34.307
What difference does it make?
I thought you wanted him to go!

44:34.432 --> 44:36.517
It's the principle.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.637
You could have been 1,000 miles away.

44:47.737 --> 44:52.241
- Now you're trapped here.
- You're tryin' to fuck me up.

44:52.450 --> 44:55.578
I'm not listening.

45:25.817 --> 45:27.902
Write another cheque.

45:51.050 --> 45:53.553
You get rid of him.

46:06.149 --> 46:08.885
- Want a receipt?
- A cancelled cheque will be fine.

46:08.985 --> 46:11.404
You OK?

46:29.339 --> 46:31.174
Liar.

46:31.424 --> 46:32.967
Nora?

46:39.015 --> 46:42.852
Hey! Hold it! I know how to use it.

46:42.977 --> 46:45.355
Let her go!

46:49.025 --> 46:52.362
May, go upstairs. Now.

46:52.570 --> 46:54.530
Let her go, Wally.

46:54.656 --> 46:56.616
Let her go, Wally.

46:57.450 --> 46:59.953
Albert, huh? Albert for Nora?

47:00.203 --> 47:03.289
I read your letters to Nora, Tim.

47:03.539 --> 47:07.168
You both want to rekindle
your passion for life.

47:07.293 --> 47:10.713
Hey, I know that feeling.
I know that feeling.

47:10.922 --> 47:16.636
And you're both liars. Mendacity is
the great sin that's destroying America.

47:16.886 --> 47:20.932
And I'm a living reproach to you,
cos I'm an honest man.

47:21.057 --> 47:24.978
You wanna destroy me,
but you're no match for me.

47:25.103 --> 47:27.480
It's a judgement call, Tim.

47:27.605 --> 47:30.525
Huh? It's your move.
You wanna play this game?

47:30.733 --> 47:34.904
But you gotta be willing
to go all the way.

47:37.824 --> 47:40.743
Come on. Come on.

47:43.663 --> 47:46.165
Come on.

47:52.005 --> 47:54.407
Don't hurt him!

47:54.507 --> 47:59.846
I really like this family,
but you're pushing my patience.

48:00.013 --> 48:03.474
- He was gonna cut my throat.
- So what?

48:03.683 --> 48:05.852
Albert! Albert!

48:21.618 --> 48:24.854
- What are we doing?
- You idiot!

48:24.954 --> 48:27.774
You see what happens when you lie, Nora?

48:27.874 --> 48:30.585
You're lucky he's still alive.

48:30.710 --> 48:32.795
Get Timmy upstairs now.

49:06.579 --> 49:10.500
You need stitches.
May, help me with this. May!

49:13.252 --> 49:16.047
- Are you OK, Dad?
- May!

49:18.549 --> 49:20.760
Put your finger up there.

49:22.303 --> 49:26.057
Tim, you can't go on
taking chances like that. You can't.

49:26.182 --> 49:30.420
- You just don't know...
- There's nothing else to do.

49:30.520 --> 49:33.022
- Move your hand, Zack.
- I'm gonna be OK.

49:33.272 --> 49:35.775
Everything will be fine.
They'll leave soon.

49:35.942 --> 49:40.847
- Rip me off some tape.
- Why not shoot them with Mommy's gun?

49:40.947 --> 49:44.284
What? You got a gun?
Where'd you get a gun?

49:44.534 --> 49:46.369
- I bought it when you left.
- Why?

49:46.619 --> 49:49.706
I was scared at night.
I was afraid at night!

49:49.831 --> 49:52.108
- You got a gun?
- Pull me off some tape.

49:52.208 --> 49:55.361
Where's the gun, Mom?

49:55.461 --> 49:58.172
Clipped on top of that cabinet.

49:58.381 --> 50:01.926
More tape. Tape! Hurry, Zack.

50:02.135 --> 50:05.555
- I'm trying, Mommy.
- Quietly, OK?

50:08.891 --> 50:11.227
- Here?
- More.

50:20.403 --> 50:24.032
- Mom, the gun is not here.
- It is up there somewhere.

50:24.240 --> 50:28.202
One of the retards must have found it.

50:28.328 --> 50:31.956
I'm sure Bosworth doesn't know, anyway.

50:32.081 --> 50:35.710
May, remember when you jumped
from here to the garage roof?

50:35.835 --> 50:37.795
She broke her arm.

50:38.004 --> 50:40.298
I was a little girl then.
I could make it now.

50:40.423 --> 50:44.344
It's a closer angle from Zack's room.
Can you try it? Just jumping off.

50:44.469 --> 50:46.663
Daddy, I'm too scared.

50:46.763 --> 50:50.308
You know heights make him dizzy.
I won't let them take the chance.

50:50.516 --> 50:56.439
- What if they fall or get caught?
- They're in the same situation as now.

50:58.650 --> 51:00.610
Isn't it worth a chance?

51:00.860 --> 51:02.820
Thanks.

51:04.072 --> 51:07.934
- Zack, don't try till it's light.
- No. No!

51:08.034 --> 51:10.620
- OK.
- What if Bosworth is telling the truth?

51:10.745 --> 51:14.707
What if he really doesn't mean
to hurt us?

51:22.215 --> 51:28.054
Michael wants the children to sleep
in their own room tonight.

51:28.262 --> 51:32.141
Zack, come on. I'll tell you a story.

51:32.308 --> 51:34.727
Zack, I'll tell you a story.

51:35.895 --> 51:37.964
Zack.

51:38.064 --> 51:40.149
See you in the morning.

51:53.162 --> 51:59.252
If they make it out tonight, we won't be
Bosworth's favourite family any more.

51:59.419 --> 52:05.508
I hold you responsible
for everything that's happened, Tim.

52:05.675 --> 52:08.720
He kept his word.

52:08.928 --> 52:12.765
Nobody got hurt
until you broke your word.

52:12.890 --> 52:18.938
Nora, everything that happened
up to now doesn't matter, doesn't exist.

52:19.147 --> 52:23.009
Yesterday we were bickering about
who got to keep the golf membership.

52:23.109 --> 52:26.654
You can't believe him, Nora.
You have to trust me.

52:26.863 --> 52:29.157
You have to trust me.

52:37.498 --> 52:41.044
I just wanna go to sleep.

52:42.211 --> 52:47.634
I just wanna go to sleep
and never wake up.

53:00.313 --> 53:02.398
Here.

53:04.484 --> 53:06.486
I love you.

53:58.288 --> 54:02.583
- She's going to cross the state line.
- Of course she is.

54:02.792 --> 54:06.045
I hate it when you talk like
you already know what's happening.

54:06.212 --> 54:09.048
Hate is a strong word, Bob.
Just stay with her.

54:23.563 --> 54:26.983
The primary's stopping at a phone booth.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.423
I can't make out the number.

54:55.762 --> 54:58.765
I'm sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialled.

54:58.890 --> 55:02.226
Please check the number and dial again.

55:24.332 --> 55:27.543
Tell Tail-End Charlie to pick up
the number on that payphone,

55:27.669 --> 55:32.882
call the phone company
and find out who she called at 7.15 am.

55:43.101 --> 55:45.311
Goddammit. Stay with her.

55:49.482 --> 55:52.402
This bitch is gonna get us killed.

56:11.754 --> 56:14.090
We're losing her.

56:23.349 --> 56:28.254
Let the state police book her,
but make sure they keep it quiet.

56:28.354 --> 56:30.773
I want Bosworth to be expecting her.

56:30.940 --> 56:35.528
While Romeo waits,
we'll have a chat with Juliet.

56:42.327 --> 56:44.412
You answer it.

56:44.537 --> 56:46.914
Hello.

56:47.040 --> 56:49.292
Hello, Kyle.

56:49.417 --> 56:52.629
I'll have to see if she's here. Hold on.

56:52.754 --> 56:54.839
It's for May.

56:55.048 --> 56:57.216
May?

56:57.467 --> 57:00.553
- May!
- Wally, bring the kids down, now.

57:00.678 --> 57:02.764
I'm here.

57:09.729 --> 57:11.731
Hi.

57:14.651 --> 57:17.070
Hi. I'm sorry, Dad.

57:19.238 --> 57:21.724
I'm sorry.

57:21.824 --> 57:24.160
You're sorry about what?

57:24.661 --> 57:30.291
- Sorry to be here with people like you.
- May, it's Kyle.

57:35.922 --> 57:37.924
- Hello.
- Hi.

57:39.258 --> 57:41.761
I called you at your dad's.

57:41.970 --> 57:44.163
He went out of town.

57:44.263 --> 57:46.849
Do you want to meet me
at the lake in an hour?

57:46.975 --> 57:49.477
No, I'm busy.

57:49.686 --> 57:52.522
You were going to be with me today.

57:54.357 --> 57:56.359
Well?

57:57.277 --> 57:59.362
Hello?

58:01.364 --> 58:06.577
- What are you being such a bitch for?
- Because I am.

58:21.884 --> 58:25.038
Now, you can't stay here much longer.

58:25.138 --> 58:28.266
Somebody's bound to notice.
People see things.

58:28.474 --> 58:31.477
People see what they wanna see.

58:31.602 --> 58:35.465
Hey, May, why don't you
make us some coffee?

58:35.565 --> 58:38.276
Go on, honey. Go on.

58:38.401 --> 58:41.487
- I'll go with her.
- It's OK, I'll go.

58:44.407 --> 58:47.560
What about the other kid?

58:47.660 --> 58:49.954
Go upstairs and get him.

59:01.841 --> 59:03.926
Michael!

59:04.552 --> 59:06.012
Hey, Mike! Mike!

59:08.097 --> 59:10.183
Zack!

59:10.391 --> 59:14.671
I don't know if you should be
climbing around like that.

59:14.771 --> 59:17.690
- Hey, that's a big drop.
- Hello.

59:17.899 --> 59:20.693
- Hi.
- How are you doin'?

59:20.818 --> 59:23.513
Is Mrs Cornell in?

59:23.613 --> 59:27.283
I'm Ed Tallent, her real-estate man.

59:28.117 --> 59:30.119
Somethin' wrong here?

59:31.663 --> 59:34.457
Nothing's wrong, real-estate man.
Get in here.

59:34.582 --> 59:37.794
Ed! Christ, Ed.
What the hell are you doing here?

59:38.044 --> 59:40.713
Ed, for God's sake.

59:42.715 --> 59:47.704
I just came by to tell Nora there were
some problems with the closing.

59:47.804 --> 59:52.517
I think that we may not be able
to make escrow by Christmas.

59:53.643 --> 59:56.145
- Zack, May. Go upstairs, now.
- But...

59:56.396 --> 59:58.773
Don't argue with me! Get outta here.

59:58.898 --> 01:00:01.484
This is not good, Michael.

01:00:04.487 --> 01:00:09.726
Now, look. Ed can stay with us till you go.
He won't be a problem.

01:00:09.826 --> 01:00:12.662
There's a lady raking leaves,
looking over here.

01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:17.542
Albert, now is not the time
to do something dumb.

01:00:19.002 --> 01:00:22.338
- I say he cannot stay here.
- Albert!

01:00:22.547 --> 01:00:24.824
You won't be here that much longer.

01:00:24.924 --> 01:00:27.844
Ed can stay in the basement if you want.

01:00:27.969 --> 01:00:31.831
We can all stay down there if it
makes you easier. I give you my word.

01:00:31.931 --> 01:00:34.434
Come on, I swear it.

01:00:49.866 --> 01:00:52.702
Now maybe you'll understand.

01:00:54.245 --> 01:00:57.165
God. Oh, God.

01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:04.864
- What is she doing? Jesus Christ.
- Calm down, Albert.

01:01:04.964 --> 01:01:07.383
Albert, just calm down.

01:01:07.592 --> 01:01:11.220
He doesn't care about you, Albert.
You're not part of his planning.

01:01:11.346 --> 01:01:14.974
- He's gonna kill you too.
- You know, Albert, you're so dumb.

01:01:15.099 --> 01:01:17.727
I can't take it here, Michael.

01:01:26.778 --> 01:01:30.531
We're gonna go right now.
And I'm not foolin' around.

01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:33.743
Albert, where did you get the gun?

01:01:33.868 --> 01:01:37.497
Where'd you get the gun, Albert?

01:01:37.622 --> 01:01:39.707
I found it.

01:01:42.627 --> 01:01:46.798
Nora. Hey, Nora, did you lie to me?

01:01:46.923 --> 01:01:50.660
I didn't mean to lie to you.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.556
I didn't mean to lie, but you lied to us.
You said you'd be gone by midnight!

01:01:55.682 --> 01:01:58.601
Shut up! Shut up!

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:05.024
Goddammit, Albert,
gimme the gun. Gimme the gun.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.240
I can't handle this. It's too much.

01:02:13.366 --> 01:02:15.451
I'm going.

01:02:16.619 --> 01:02:19.330
Well, why not?

01:02:19.455 --> 01:02:22.775
- You can go.
- What are you talking about?

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:25.878
It's best we split up now.

01:02:28.715 --> 01:02:31.843
Do me a favour before you go, Albert.

01:02:32.051 --> 01:02:35.305
- Get rid of the dead.
- You mean that...

01:02:37.974 --> 01:02:40.184
I can go?

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:42.562
Yeah.

01:02:42.687 --> 01:02:44.772
Yeah, you head south.

01:02:46.149 --> 01:02:49.360
And we'll all meet up in Juárez.

01:02:49.569 --> 01:02:52.055
What the hell's goin' on here, Mike?

01:02:52.155 --> 01:02:55.325
I'm killing two birds with one stone.

01:02:56.659 --> 01:03:00.079
Timmy and his family want us to leave.

01:03:00.204 --> 01:03:02.899
Then they're gonna have to help us.

01:03:02.999 --> 01:03:06.461
- How?
- You're gonna have to drop by the bank.

01:03:06.669 --> 01:03:10.406
- Ten thousand would be just fine.
- I don't have that much money.

01:03:10.506 --> 01:03:14.494
- You gonna start lying to me again?
- Someone's gonna have to go with him.

01:03:14.594 --> 01:03:18.665
- He's gonna go straight to the police!
- What did I tell you?

01:03:18.765 --> 01:03:22.435
Stop thinkin'.
He's goin' all by himself.

01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:25.938
He's mad, but he's scared.

01:03:32.111 --> 01:03:34.113
Come on.

01:03:35.657 --> 01:03:37.951
I'll see you guys in Mexico.

01:03:41.788 --> 01:03:45.959
Mexico. Definitely Mexico.

01:03:47.961 --> 01:03:51.089
I've never been alone.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.550
Not since...

01:03:57.136 --> 01:04:00.139
I met Wally when we were little kids.

01:04:07.355 --> 01:04:09.440
Get the door.

01:05:00.742 --> 01:05:05.104
Got only one thing for you
to think about out there.

01:05:05.204 --> 01:05:11.044
Any red-light show,
any sirens, they get it first.

01:05:11.294 --> 01:05:14.380
Not you, them. You think about that.

01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:18.801
Good morning, sir.

01:05:29.729 --> 01:05:32.982
- Sorry.
- She was next.

01:05:38.279 --> 01:05:40.657
We usually require
your wife's signature.

01:05:40.782 --> 01:05:43.910
My wife's not well.
I've been banking here for 14 years.

01:05:44.118 --> 01:05:48.398
I opened the account myself
and I want to close it out myself.

01:05:48.498 --> 01:05:52.460
- I'll have to talk to Mr Nelson.
- Is he in? Good.

01:05:59.759 --> 01:06:04.247
Mr Cornell? You know there's a penalty
for cashing these certificates out?

01:06:04.347 --> 01:06:07.475
I know that.
But it's unavoidable, you see.

01:06:07.684 --> 01:06:11.020
I just need the cash. It's an emergency.

01:06:13.606 --> 01:06:18.094
If you'll sign right there,
I'll cash you out, Mr Cornell.

01:06:18.194 --> 01:06:21.848
- Cashiers' cheque?
- No, cash, please.

01:06:21.948 --> 01:06:24.033
Cash.

01:06:26.661 --> 01:06:28.746
And one more, please.

01:06:31.374 --> 01:06:35.545
- Very kind of you. Thank you.
- It'll be a moment.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.479
Here you are, Mr Cornell.
But please count it.

01:06:53.646 --> 01:06:56.149
I'm sure it's OK. Thanks.

01:06:56.274 --> 01:06:58.234
Thanks a lot.

01:06:59.819 --> 01:07:01.821
Who's next, please?

01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:29.218
The FBI announced today it will not
file charges against Nancy Breyers

01:09:29.344 --> 01:09:32.971
in connection with the escape
of accused killer Michael Bosworth.

01:09:33.096 --> 01:09:35.183
Breyers was not available for comment.

01:09:35.308 --> 01:09:39.127
We'll keep you posted
with further information as it b...

01:09:39.228 --> 01:09:41.648
- She's in control.
- So why doesn't she call?

01:09:41.856 --> 01:09:44.484
She will.

01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:46.986
She will?

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.812
What do you find so amusing?

01:09:55.912 --> 01:09:57.705
You.

01:10:12.512 --> 01:10:14.514
Wally.

01:10:19.268 --> 01:10:23.690
Looks like you won
the Vietnam war all by yourself.

01:10:40.123 --> 01:10:42.333
That's a good boy.

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.611
I knew you wouldn't take any chances.

01:10:44.711 --> 01:10:46.796
- What have you got?
- I'm not sure.

01:10:46.921 --> 01:10:49.424
A body's been found
in the south of the county.

01:10:49.549 --> 01:10:53.303
A real-estate agent named Ed Tallent,
shot at point-blank range.

01:10:53.469 --> 01:10:56.206
- It may mean nothing.
- Where was he found?

01:10:56.306 --> 01:11:00.376
In a riverbed. His car is on the scene,
about five hours from here.

01:11:00.476 --> 01:11:07.050
Probably does mean somethin'. Get me
the addresses of all his residential listings.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:11.112
It's my opinion Bosworth believes
he can escape from anywhere.

01:11:11.321 --> 01:11:14.015
I'd like to start settin' up
roadblocks in the area.

01:11:14.115 --> 01:11:19.329
Request denied. Bosworth's in a house,
and there sure as hell are hostages.

01:11:19.454 --> 01:11:22.148
That's the way he plays.

01:11:22.248 --> 01:11:26.836
Your orders are to wait for me
to give you more orders.

01:11:26.961 --> 01:11:28.921
Thank you, ma'am.

01:11:31.341 --> 01:11:33.326
Maddox!

01:11:33.426 --> 01:11:37.263
If you learn anything, don't drift away!

01:11:38.431 --> 01:11:40.933
I'm just a cheap float in a stormy sea.

01:11:43.645 --> 01:11:46.439
Yeah, it was beautiful. It was great.

01:11:49.692 --> 01:11:51.778
I'll call you later.

01:11:53.237 --> 01:11:55.239
Hey.

01:12:01.788 --> 01:12:04.165
Which way are you guys goin'?

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:07.627
Sorry.

01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:12.298
What college do you go to?

01:12:15.551 --> 01:12:17.971
- Fuck off.
- Aw, come on.

01:12:18.179 --> 01:12:21.474
I just need a lift a little ways.
That's all.

01:12:21.724 --> 01:12:23.559
- Go away, please!
- Come on.

01:12:23.685 --> 01:12:26.521
Lisa, call the police now! Run! Run!

01:12:26.896 --> 01:12:28.606
Get away from me!

01:13:00.805 --> 01:13:04.042
We got a report of a man
covered in blood harassing two girls

01:13:04.142 --> 01:13:07.061
at the gas station on Waxman Road.

01:13:12.775 --> 01:13:14.027
We're there.

01:14:58.423 --> 01:15:00.633
You, in the water!

01:15:00.842 --> 01:15:03.636
Drop your weapon!

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.323
Hey! You, in the water!

01:15:31.998 --> 01:15:35.001
Drop your weapon!

01:15:36.377 --> 01:15:41.382
I'm not gonna tell you again!
Put the gun down!

01:16:05.156 --> 01:16:08.910
Put the gun down!

01:16:26.219 --> 01:16:29.639
That gun the kid was carrying
is registered to a Nora Cornell,

01:16:29.764 --> 01:16:31.849
on Whitney Drive, which is right here.

01:16:32.058 --> 01:16:35.478
Give me those residential listings.

01:16:35.603 --> 01:16:39.883
On that call the primary placed from
the phone booth... it went to a residence.

01:16:39.983 --> 01:16:43.820
Timothy and Nora Cornell,
1448 Whitney Drive.

01:16:47.407 --> 01:16:49.492
You answer now.

01:16:52.161 --> 01:16:55.315
Start talking.

01:16:55.415 --> 01:16:57.709
- What?
- Is Michael there?

01:16:57.834 --> 01:16:59.711
Yes, he is.

01:17:01.462 --> 01:17:06.175
If this is a trick,
you can kiss your family goodbye.

01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:09.929
- Yes?
- Michael?

01:17:10.138 --> 01:17:12.098
Nancy?

01:17:12.307 --> 01:17:16.586
- Nancy! Where are you?
- I'm close.

01:17:16.686 --> 01:17:19.814
- Did they believe you?
- Of course they believed me.

01:17:20.023 --> 01:17:23.860
Baby, you're brilliant.
Oh, you're brilliant!

01:17:23.985 --> 01:17:27.322
Oh, God, I miss you.

01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:32.035
We're at 1448 Whitney.
How long will it take?

01:17:32.201 --> 01:17:38.291
- I can get there in less than an hour.
- You just be careful. You stay calm.

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:41.085
- Just think about us together.
- I will.

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:43.796
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:17:49.761 --> 01:17:52.347
She's on her way.

01:17:52.555 --> 01:17:56.392
She's on her way.
It's almost over, Timmy.

01:17:56.601 --> 01:17:59.020
I'll be out of here
in less than an hour.

01:17:59.228 --> 01:18:01.230
What about us?

01:18:04.233 --> 01:18:08.071
Timmy, have I ever
broken any promises to you?

01:18:09.739 --> 01:18:11.741
Let's go!

01:18:15.078 --> 01:18:19.749
- Where is she?
- She's back at the command post.

01:18:19.874 --> 01:18:24.337
OK, let's have it. But make it fast.

01:18:24.587 --> 01:18:29.467
All right. Right now, she's officially
just an innocent civilian.

01:18:29.592 --> 01:18:32.178
- No charges.
- If she cooperates.

01:18:32.387 --> 01:18:36.975
And if you send her in there
and anything happens tonight,

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.269
they'll have our ugly asses in court.

01:18:39.477 --> 01:18:42.922
No, only one ass is involved.

01:18:43.022 --> 01:18:44.899
Mine.

01:18:45.108 --> 01:18:47.193
And what's ugly about it?

01:18:49.362 --> 01:18:54.784
We've got exigent circumstances here.
The rules don't apply.

01:18:54.993 --> 01:18:57.287
We've got a ticket to ride.

01:18:57.537 --> 01:19:01.457
I just don't think
it's worth the chance.

01:19:01.582 --> 01:19:05.420
The guy is a fuckin' maniac.

01:19:05.545 --> 01:19:08.256
- He's not afraid to die.
- Maddox is right.

01:19:08.381 --> 01:19:13.886
It's only a matter of time
before we go tactical on this shithead.

01:19:14.804 --> 01:19:18.374
Listen closely while I pull rank on you.

01:19:18.474 --> 01:19:21.060
We're doin' it my way.

01:19:21.185 --> 01:19:24.731
We will discuss it no more, for ever.

01:19:35.908 --> 01:19:38.394
Get it off her. He'll search her.

01:19:38.494 --> 01:19:40.872
- He trusts me.
- Get it off.

01:19:42.248 --> 01:19:46.753
Remember now, all you have to do
is to get him to leave.

01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:50.798
Once you're well away from here,
stop at some rest room down the road.

01:19:51.007 --> 01:19:54.677
- We'll take it from there.
- I understand.

01:19:54.886 --> 01:19:59.040
If you don't, you know what's
gonna happen to you, don't you?

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:02.060
I told you. I want to live.

01:20:07.273 --> 01:20:10.068
- My knees are shaking.
- I can hear your knees.

01:20:10.193 --> 01:20:14.447
You do this, no charges will be brought.
You can't turn your back now.

01:20:14.697 --> 01:20:18.743
- If you do, we're gonna take casualties.
- I know. I know.

01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:21.980
You think she'll think straight
when she's with Bosworth?

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.457
She's got her brains between her legs.

01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:28.027
I can be inside that house in one minute.
Flashbangs at the door.

01:20:28.127 --> 01:20:32.298
- We make a three-point entry, it's all over.
- We're givin' that family a chance.

01:20:32.507 --> 01:20:36.369
The way they played along, maybe
they don't have any chance coming.

01:20:36.469 --> 01:20:38.454
You don't give a damn, do you?

01:20:38.554 --> 01:20:41.808
If it goes sideways,
we'll waste the whole neighbourhood.

01:20:57.949 --> 01:21:01.619
Don't forget to smile when you see him.

01:21:02.745 --> 01:21:06.082
He might want me to...

01:21:06.499 --> 01:21:09.502
Well, smile when you do that too.

01:21:09.627 --> 01:21:11.838
Oh, God, I can't.

01:21:12.046 --> 01:21:14.007
You can.

01:21:15.883 --> 01:21:19.095
- I'm not ready to die.
- Then you make sure

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:21.848
you do just what I told you.

01:21:23.391 --> 01:21:26.085
What happens when we come outside?

01:21:26.185 --> 01:21:30.815
What if he realises
what I'm doing to him?

01:21:31.024 --> 01:21:34.444
I want a gun, or I won't go in. I won't.

01:21:53.838 --> 01:21:56.341
I just put my ass on the line.

01:21:56.549 --> 01:21:59.802
Now you get outta here.
My earrings are killing me.

01:22:00.011 --> 01:22:01.971
I'm in a real bad mood.

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.182
You be careful.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.240
I'm passing command to you.

01:22:21.366 --> 01:22:25.954
If you fuck this up, you'll leave
your badge in a manila envelope.

01:22:26.079 --> 01:22:28.231
'Cause I don't want to see you
when I get back.

01:22:28.331 --> 01:22:30.541
I'm goin' to the observation point.

01:23:21.009 --> 01:23:23.511
Subject is on the scene.

01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:03.551
I know that they tried
to get you to betray me.

01:24:29.702 --> 01:24:31.913
Let me introduce you to the Cornells.

01:24:32.038 --> 01:24:35.441
I got this wacko in my sights.
I think I can take him.

01:24:35.541 --> 01:24:38.169
That's Zack, and May.

01:24:38.378 --> 01:24:42.031
And Nora. This is
the greatest woman in the world.

01:24:42.131 --> 01:24:46.511
My God, what are you doing?
You must be insane.

01:24:46.719 --> 01:24:49.973
- You shut up!
- Zack, go upstairs, now.

01:24:55.061 --> 01:24:58.898
Nancy, I have somethin' that I wanna...

01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:07.573
I wanna give to you. It's gonna keep us
together for the rest of our lives.

01:25:07.782 --> 01:25:10.576
- I can't take that.
- This used to be Nora's.

01:25:14.163 --> 01:25:17.250
- What's going on?
- Turn around.

01:25:17.375 --> 01:25:22.505
- I gotta get through to see somebody.
- We got a problem with the traffic.

01:25:23.631 --> 01:25:25.591
Hey!

01:25:35.602 --> 01:25:39.172
Jesus Christ! We've got company.

01:25:39.272 --> 01:25:41.441
Goddamn son of a bitch.

01:25:54.621 --> 01:25:57.415
It's too late. See what he does.

01:25:58.458 --> 01:26:00.877
- May!
- Who's that?

01:26:01.044 --> 01:26:03.129
It's May's boyfriend.

01:26:03.254 --> 01:26:06.466
Come on, May, open up.

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:17.977
Hi, Kyle. How you doin', kid?

01:26:20.355 --> 01:26:23.691
I'm sorry to stop by so late, but I...

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:30.907
May and I had a fight, and if she could go
for a ride with me, I'd really appreciate it.

01:26:31.699 --> 01:26:35.161
She may still be angry, pal.
I'll ask her.

01:26:37.038 --> 01:26:40.249
- I'll wait for her here.
- OK, you bet.

01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:53.304
He wants to take May for a ride.
He won't leave without her.

01:26:53.513 --> 01:26:57.475
- That's one less we gotta worry about.
- Then you call her.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.435
May!

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.605
May, come down, please.

01:27:10.613 --> 01:27:13.533
May, Kyle's outside.

01:27:14.284 --> 01:27:18.955
He wants to make it up with you.
Now, you have to go. Now.

01:27:21.666 --> 01:27:24.043
Go on with him.

01:27:24.168 --> 01:27:26.863
I'm not leaving
unless my mom stays here.

01:27:26.963 --> 01:27:29.590
Nora's comin' with me.

01:27:29.799 --> 01:27:32.802
- What for?
- So you don't call the cops when we go.

01:27:32.927 --> 01:27:36.139
Bosworth, you are so close.
Don't blow it.

01:27:36.347 --> 01:27:39.375
If she doesn't go,
Kyle will make a scene. I know it.

01:27:39.475 --> 01:27:42.228
Let her go, Mike, please.

01:27:42.395 --> 01:27:48.860
You and I have a date with destiny, Tim.
You'll be comin' with me, after all.

01:27:48.985 --> 01:27:52.739
I could trust Nora
more than I could trust you.

01:27:54.532 --> 01:27:56.492
Dad, what about you?

01:27:57.410 --> 01:28:00.230
We're gonna win if you do as he says.

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:02.749
I love you, Daddy.

01:28:04.751 --> 01:28:06.711
I love you.

01:28:09.505 --> 01:28:11.215
Go.

01:28:12.342 --> 01:28:14.427
OK, OK.

01:28:15.887 --> 01:28:18.932
You go with your boyfriend, May.

01:28:19.098 --> 01:28:21.851
You go far away.

01:28:22.352 --> 01:28:25.480
Otherwise I'm gonna kill your daddy.

01:28:35.698 --> 01:28:38.409
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

01:28:38.534 --> 01:28:43.081
I don't know what's goin' on,
but let's get outta here.

01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:57.470
Right. You move it. You get the car.

01:29:26.582 --> 01:29:33.673
Mr Cornell, I'm Special Agent Brenda
Chandler, FBI. We're here to help you.

01:29:33.881 --> 01:29:36.910
You can't do that.
You'll get my family killed.

01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:39.721
We're gonna let them drive away.

01:29:39.929 --> 01:29:43.474
No, I'm going with them.
Bosworth and his brother and the girl.

01:29:43.683 --> 01:29:45.852
- You're hurt.
- No, I'm not.

01:29:47.729 --> 01:29:50.273
I'm OK.

01:29:53.985 --> 01:29:59.449
Don't take long in there.
He's gonna go suicidal any minute now.

01:30:09.959 --> 01:30:13.279
- Why are you doin' that?
- A wild idea. You have to trust me.

01:30:13.379 --> 01:30:15.698
Mr Cornell.

01:30:15.798 --> 01:30:20.887
If we have to go tactical,
we're gonna take casualties.

01:30:21.012 --> 01:30:23.306
It's one more chance I'll have to take.

01:30:28.394 --> 01:30:32.899
- How come I didn't hear the car start?
- No key.

01:30:33.024 --> 01:30:35.109
Put your arms up.

01:30:38.237 --> 01:30:40.907
What is this? Huh? What's this?

01:30:41.032 --> 01:30:45.311
- Huh? What the fuck is this?
- I found it on the seat of her car.

01:30:45.411 --> 01:30:47.705
I was... I was scared.

01:30:47.914 --> 01:30:50.416
All right. You get goin' now.

01:30:52.001 --> 01:30:54.921
I wanna say goodbye to Zack.

01:31:00.134 --> 01:31:03.972
Hey, Daddy.
There's people with guns outside.

01:31:04.097 --> 01:31:07.183
- I saw them. I'm scared.
- Shh.

01:31:07.308 --> 01:31:09.269
You must be quiet.

01:31:09.519 --> 01:31:12.839
You can't do this to me.
You've got to speak quietly.

01:31:12.939 --> 01:31:17.193
- Are they gonna shoot us?
- No, no. They're here to help us.

01:31:17.318 --> 01:31:20.530
I know you're scared.
But we mustn't let the men know.

01:31:35.795 --> 01:31:37.755
OK, I'll be back soon.

01:31:40.049 --> 01:31:42.035
- Tim.
- What?

01:31:42.135 --> 01:31:44.537
Tim,

01:31:44.637 --> 01:31:48.057
there's so many things
I want to tell you.

01:31:48.182 --> 01:31:52.478
- And I don't have time to tell you.
- I know. Me too.

01:32:05.408 --> 01:32:10.580
This place is a tomb.
You two get out first. Get in the back.

01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:13.916
Nancy, start the engine.
Don't turn on the lights.

01:32:42.695 --> 01:32:46.266
- Shit.
- Nancy, what's wrong?

01:32:46.366 --> 01:32:48.785
No!

01:32:49.619 --> 01:32:51.788
Hold it! Hold it!

01:32:54.499 --> 01:32:56.709
Hold it, Bosworth!

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.549
- Where are you hit?
- In the ego!

01:33:03.675 --> 01:33:06.386
Get me a bullhorn!

01:33:31.744 --> 01:33:34.314
- What if they shoot Daddy?
- They won't.

01:33:34.414 --> 01:33:37.750
- You betrayed me!
- Michael, no!

01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:40.570
Michael, please.

01:33:40.670 --> 01:33:43.298
I did all this for you!

01:33:45.508 --> 01:33:48.303
You shut up. Shut up. This ain't over.

01:33:50.597 --> 01:33:52.682
You watch him.

01:33:56.853 --> 01:34:03.318
This is Michael Bosworth speaking.
So before you start with your bullshit,

01:34:03.943 --> 01:34:10.283
I want a car here to take three,
no, four people to the airport.

01:34:10.408 --> 01:34:14.996
- I want a plane with five hours of fuel.
- I'll see what I can do on that.

01:34:15.121 --> 01:34:20.418
Don't you start lying to me.
I know who's in charge out there.

01:34:20.627 --> 01:34:27.200
You listen to me. I want all your people
out of there in ten minutes,

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.385
or I'll kill the whole family.

01:34:30.637 --> 01:34:33.873
- We can't negotiate him out.
- There are four hostages.

01:34:33.973 --> 01:34:37.393
- Bosworth needs killing.
- We don't violate the rules

01:34:37.518 --> 01:34:39.796
until they don't work.

01:34:39.896 --> 01:34:44.734
Everyone's alive. So far,
this is still a potential win.

01:34:44.901 --> 01:34:48.905
Someone bring a four-door car
to the house. Now.

01:34:49.197 --> 01:34:51.474
Be careful, Zack. Be careful, honey.

01:34:51.574 --> 01:34:54.827
It's OK, Mommy, don't worry.

01:34:55.036 --> 01:34:57.413
- Be careful!
- I love you. You'll be OK.

01:34:57.538 --> 01:35:00.333
Drop him!

01:35:03.795 --> 01:35:07.131
They're gonna get us outta here yet!

01:35:09.842 --> 01:35:12.136
Wally!

01:35:12.262 --> 01:35:14.347
- Give me the gun.
- Nora!

01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:20.587
- Nora!
- You're dying, Wally.

01:35:20.687 --> 01:35:24.857
- You're dying. You're not going anywhere.
- Nora!

01:35:31.114 --> 01:35:34.033
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

01:35:43.418 --> 01:35:46.629
Goddammit! Get over here!

01:35:47.588 --> 01:35:49.549
- Get over here!
- No!

01:35:51.884 --> 01:35:54.137
Wally!

01:35:56.973 --> 01:35:58.975
Oh, God.

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:17.076
I have decided
I love your family too much.

01:36:17.201 --> 01:36:22.081
You're all coming with me.
The more the merrier, right?

01:36:22.332 --> 01:36:26.486
You're through, Bosworth. It's over.

01:36:26.586 --> 01:36:29.505
You stay right there
or you're going to kill your wife.

01:36:29.714 --> 01:36:32.425
- Tim!
- It's OK, Nora.

01:36:33.176 --> 01:36:36.679
- Tim.
- I'm still in control, Timmy.

01:36:36.804 --> 01:36:40.667
- Tim!
- Nothing can happen to you, Nora.

01:36:40.767 --> 01:36:44.604
If you never trusted me before,
you have to trust me now.

01:36:44.729 --> 01:36:48.775
I'll blow her brains
right across the room.

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:55.448
You know what size hole this calibre
bullet makes when it exits the other side?

01:36:56.699 --> 01:36:58.785
He can't hurt you, Nora.

01:36:58.910 --> 01:37:01.120
He can't hurt you, honey.

01:37:44.247 --> 01:37:47.583
Your car is waiting, Bosworth.

01:38:22.744 --> 01:38:25.121
Do not move!

01:38:25.246 --> 01:38:27.957
Stay down!

01:38:52.649 --> 01:38:56.527
Do not move! We'll come to you!

01:39:21.427 --> 01:39:23.346
Nancy!

01:39:58.131 --> 01:40:01.050
Blade, get her out of here, will ya?

01:40:02.305 --> 01:40:08.555
