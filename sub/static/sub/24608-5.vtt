WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.869
I loved you the
first moment I saw you.

00:03.971 --> 00:06.572
- Why in God's
name would I trade one
broke artist for another?

00:06.874 --> 00:08.073
Opium.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.575
- I want to
make you happy.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.777
I worship you, Fernande.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.846
Henri Matisse.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.748
No, this artist has
more than just talent.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.249
He has vision.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.352
He's bent all the rules,
and I want to smash them.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.254
- We
have done it, Pablo.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.090
- When the Autumn
Salon opens, you'll
both be sensations.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.292
- Matisse.
I'm not submitting it.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.727
- But why?

00:28.829 --> 00:30.062
- It's not good enough.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.964
- This is
exactly how you raised me.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.265
To stand up for myself.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.000
- I want you to
stay away from Picasso.

00:35.102 --> 00:38.037
- You're not actually
in love with him, are you?

00:38.472 --> 00:41.173
- My African
masks protect me against
all evil spirits.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.777
- We found her
wandering along the river,

00:45.646 --> 00:47.746
but there was no
evidence of an attack.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.548
Perhaps you should
take her to the hospital.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.184
I don't think
she's in her right mind.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.620
- You think
she doesn't mind because
she's such a free thinker,

00:54.722 --> 00:56.288
but she does mind, very much.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.624
I'm sorry, I thought
I could do things
your way, but I can't.

00:58.726 --> 01:02.027
I'm going to look after
myself, and I hope
you look after Dora.

¶ ¶

01:45.272 --> 01:46.505
- Jump, Françoise.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.040
- No, Papa. I can't.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.308
- Jump.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.676
- Papa,
please don't make me.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.911
- The world is not
kind to women, Françoise.

01:53.013 --> 01:56.048
You must learn to
be as strong as a man.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.583
Come on, now.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.318
- I'm sorry, I.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.420
.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.467
- How did it happen?

02:15.569 --> 02:18.370
- The power was out.
I couldn't see a thing.
I slipped on the stairs.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.472
- Are you
in terrible pain?

02:20.574 --> 02:22.741
- I've
been through worse.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.511
- Uh.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.279
- Are these for me?

02:27.381 --> 02:28.881
- Yes.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.315
- I love them.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.984
- Why?

02:32.086 --> 02:35.587
- Because they
are absolutely absurd.

02:36.423 --> 02:41.260
- Yeah, yeah, well.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.166
- How is Dora?

02:47.268 --> 02:49.201
- Oh, she's
doing much better now.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.836
- Is she home
from the hospital?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.971
- Yes. She's
in psychotherapy.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.540
Even going to church.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.342
Imagine, a surrealist
who believes in God.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.680
But don't worry, I'm
taking care of her.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.652
Now let me take care of you.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.457
- I tried your
arrangement, Pablo.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.794
It didn't work for me.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.764
- These past
few months, uh, I have
missed you terribly.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.467
You inspire me
and-and challenge me.

03:23.070 --> 03:26.104
- What about Dora?

03:27.007 --> 03:30.042
- Dora and
I are through.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.445
- And what
about Marie-Thérèse?

03:34.481 --> 03:37.382
- Well, she's
the mother of my child.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.519
But we haven't
been lovers in years.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.088
I only want you, Françoise.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.857
All the time.

03:46.193 --> 03:50.095
- Hmm.
You were the one who...

03:50.898 --> 03:55.934
who said we shouldn't see
each other too often, that too
much passion burns itself out.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.638
- But you don't
think I'm always right.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.341
Do you?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.278
- It's a
lot to think about.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.613
I need some time.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.581
- Of course.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.584
I have the use of
a house by the sea.

04:12.686 --> 04:16.154
In Golfe-Juan.
Go. Recover.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.423
Bring a friend.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.493
Take your time.

04:21.595 --> 04:27.833
Think about what you want, but
don't make me wait too long.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.842
- At long last the
critics have spoken.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.078
Listen to this.

04:40.180 --> 04:44.983
Mauclair calls Matisse and his
merry band of imitators

04:45.452 --> 04:49.888
"a pot of paint flung
in the public's face."

04:50.958 --> 04:55.594
And, uh, "a Donatello
among wild beasts."

04:56.730 --> 04:59.765
- Matisse?
A wild beast? How awful.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.967
- Aren't
you tickled, Pablo?

05:02.069 --> 05:05.237
Had you submitted to the
Autumn Salon, it could've
been you they savaged.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.041
- Who the hell are you?

05:09.777 --> 05:12.010
- Pablo, I
introduced you last week.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.314
This is Géry Pieret,
my secretary.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.549
- You're
a poet, Guillaume.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.919
Why in God's name do
you need a secretary?

05:21.755 --> 05:24.756
You're all fools.
Can't you see?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.992
Matisse succeeded.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.062
Critics are-are
rotting corpses who
still think Impressionism

05:30.164 --> 05:32.664
is the modern style,
for God's sake.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.834
The fact that
they hate Matisse only
proves how great he is.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.171
"Wild beast."

05:39.273 --> 05:41.707
It's a badge of honor.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.712
My work would never
attract such anger.

05:47.181 --> 05:50.015
I need to be more offensive.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.784
More abhorrent.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.956
I need my work to shock.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.827
- It's
positively revolting.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.365
Look, she has monkey feet.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.768
- The artist is
playing with proportions.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.004
- Or maybe
he can't draw feet.

06:13.107 --> 06:15.907
- If you want
to be a real collector,
Gertrude, learn the lingo:

06:16.677 --> 06:19.411
Line, shape, form, light...

06:19.513 --> 06:21.913
- Ah, Monsieur
and Mademoiselle Stein.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.248
Welcome back.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.916
A stunning piece, no?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.452
- Hmm, I do
find it intriguing.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.790
- She'd make a beautiful
addition to yours and,
uh, your sister's collection.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.626
And she's only 200 francs.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.696
- For that?
You have got to be kidding.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.565
- Oh, she will be
worth double next year.

06:40.667 --> 06:44.269
Uh, did I hear you mention
monkey, Mademoiselle Stein?

06:45.372 --> 06:49.207
I have another Picasso
I think you might like.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.920
- If I take them
both, will you knock a
few francs off the price?

07:02.256 --> 07:03.822
- Good God,
Leo, don't...

07:03.924 --> 07:07.559
- I will give you
the pair for 350 franc.

07:09.696 --> 07:13.932
- Sold. Now
tell me, this... Picasso.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.301
Do you know where I
can find his studio?

07:16.403 --> 07:18.103
- Oh! Yes.

07:18.205 --> 07:23.542
But, uh, I must warn
you, uh, Pablo is a...
tricky little character.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.818
- Good afternoon.
I'm looking for a Mr. Picasso.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.153
- Who?

07:35.255 --> 07:38.590
- Picasso?
I was told he lived here.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.393
- There is no
Picasso here. Good-bye...

07:42.062 --> 07:45.497
- If you do see him,
would you please tell
him that the collectors

07:45.599 --> 07:48.934
Leo and Gertrude Stein just
purchased two of his paintings?

07:50.637 --> 07:54.773
We'd like to invite him
to our Saturday Salon.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.547
Oh. Dinner jackets optional.

08:04.384 --> 08:07.085
But tell him he may
want to wear pants.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.659
Pablo Picasso,
meet Henri Matisse.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.466
- Pleasure,
Monsieur Picasso.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.201
And you too, mademoiselle?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.136
- Fernande Olivier.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.706
- Ah, Enchanté.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.078
- Pretty spectacular, no?
Truly original.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.183
- Critics hated it.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.590
- I think it's
splendid, Monsieur Matisse.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.094
And I love your dinner jacket.
Is it imported?

08:49.196 --> 08:52.464
- It is, uh, Scottish
tweed from Aberdeen.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.799
You have quite the eye.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.637
- Monsieur Stein,
this room, this shrine to art...

08:58.739 --> 09:01.072
It's breathtaking.
You have such taste.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.541
- Mm.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.476
- Well,
that's debatable.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.177
Gertrude Stein, Leo's sister.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.680
- Nobody was
assuming you're my wife.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.718
- Leo, shall I
tell Henri what you said
about "Woman with a Hat,"

09:14.221 --> 09:17.322
the first time you saw it?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.892
.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.429
- Eh, Monsieur Picasso,
I hear the Steins have purchased
two of your works, huh?

09:25.032 --> 09:27.599
- There's
one right over here.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.240
- Gertrude, should
I tell Mr. Picasso what
you said about his painting

09:35.342 --> 09:36.942
the first time you saw it?

09:37.044 --> 09:38.677
- I said
I hate the feet.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.112
I still do,
so I covered them.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.553
- Mm, I
quite like them.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.757
They remind me, in a way,
of primitive sculpture.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.960
- Well, they
remind me of the gout.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.929
I think the painting would
be far superior without them.

09:58.031 --> 10:02.701
Would you mind
terribly if we eh, just
them off, Mr. Picasso?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.143
I suppose that's a 'no.'

10:12.980 --> 10:14.779
- You
can't just leave.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.048
- Do you think
I'm going to stand there
and be insulted while you

10:17.150 --> 10:18.783
flirt with every man in sight?

10:18.885 --> 10:20.285
- What are
you talking about?

10:20.387 --> 10:21.987
- I saw how you
were with Matisse.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.922
That condescending bastard.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.657
- I was just
trying to be nice.

10:25.759 --> 10:29.394
- Next time,
try without your hands.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.329
- Are you honestly
jealous of Henri Matisse?

10:31.431 --> 10:32.697
- Course not.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.633
- Then why
are you running?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.601
The Steins are
serious collectors.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.437
Think of what they
could do for your career.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.540
We need to make
friends with them.

10:42.643 --> 10:46.311
- How am I
supposed to make friends
with that rhinoceros?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.446
- Paint her portrait.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.382
- Why the hell
would I do that?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.517
- Every woman
wants to be painted.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.953
It makes them feel beautiful
a-and I suspect Gertrude

10:55.055 --> 10:58.356
hasn't been made to
feel that way too often.

10:58.458 --> 11:02.394
- I am not a
portrait painter for hire.

11:02.963 --> 11:07.799
- Matisse
painted a portrait and he
caused quite a stir, no?

11:09.836 --> 11:12.771
- How
would you like me?

11:13.640 --> 11:16.141
- You can take
off the jacket.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.677
And the hat.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.945
- Oh.

11:21.048 --> 11:24.182
Since I'm modeling for you,
I was thinking I'd remove
everything but the hat.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.252
What?

11:27.354 --> 11:31.156
I was under the impression
you wanted to paint a
bold response to Matisse.

11:31.892 --> 11:35.794
- Clothes on,
hat off, please.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.943
- What do you think of Renoir?
- He's a hack.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.611
- Monet?
- Wallpaper.

11:53.714 --> 11:57.515
- Cézanne?
- Is this some sort of test?

11:58.118 --> 12:01.853
- My brother says I
don't know enough about art.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.724
- Some advice, stop
listening to your brother.

12:24.544 --> 12:28.046
- Pablo, I'm
enjoying our time, but this
must be your 40th attempt.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.149
Maybe if I look at it...

12:31.251 --> 12:34.252
- Not until I'm finished.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.755
This can't be just
an ordinary painting.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.290
If I'm going to outdo Matisse.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.260
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

12:43.230 --> 12:46.297
- I know I'm not
pretty like your other models.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.367
- Nonsense.
You are magnificent.

12:51.772 --> 12:55.707
I just need to find a
way to truly capture you.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.782
- I'm an
artist too, you know.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.618
A writer.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.621
And you've inspired me
to write a novel, Pablo.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.491
Can I write while you paint?

13:14.461 --> 13:18.296
- I'm sorry.
I need to see your eyes.

13:20.433 --> 13:24.102
- Fine.
I'll work it out in my head.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.741
Who knows, at this rate I
might finish before you do.

13:30.544 --> 13:33.111
- What I love
most is her shape.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.881
African artists
aren't constrained
by classical notions

13:37.551 --> 13:39.551
of the-the female anatomy.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.620
They do...
As they feel and so should we.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.623
- Ah.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.393
Henri's showing you one
of the inspirations behind
his latest masterpiece.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.232
Come. What do you think?

14:03.076 --> 14:07.412
- It's absolutely
extraordinary.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.951
- I hear you have
started work on something
special with Gertrude.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.688
How's it coming?

14:16.790 --> 14:20.325
- Yes, how is it coming?

14:23.029 --> 14:27.365
- "Something is
coming out of him, certainly
it is coming out of him,

14:27.467 --> 14:32.103
certainly it is something,
certainly it is coming out
of him and it has meaning..."

14:40.647 --> 14:42.480
You finished?

14:42.582 --> 14:47.719
- I am, but
the painting is not.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.524
Please go.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.796
- Oh I don't,
I don't understand.

15:01.334 --> 15:05.904
- I look at your face,
but I cannot see it anymore.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.244
- No, Pablo!
What are you doing?

15:28.578 --> 15:30.912
- Oh, my Lord.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.982
Apollinaire was
invited to the Steins
for their Saturday Salon

15:34.084 --> 15:36.317
and he brought
that secretary of his.

15:36.419 --> 15:39.053
What's his name? Pieret!

15:39.756 --> 15:41.789
He tried to steal a
Cézanne right off the wall.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.094
And Max was there,
drunk, of course.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.831
- I don't care
about gossip, Fernande.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.167
Please, I'm working.

15:55.538 --> 15:59.107
- Why are you in such
a foul mood all of a sudden?

16:06.549 --> 16:11.619
- You're right.
Let's get some sun.

16:14.024 --> 16:16.524
- Francoise!
I've made new friends.

16:16.860 --> 16:20.061
They want to take
us for a drink.

16:20.497 --> 16:22.530
- You
go on, I'm busy.

16:22.632 --> 16:25.466
- Francoise, I
traveled all the way down here
to have some fun with you

16:25.568 --> 16:28.169
and all you do is paint and,
uh, what are you doing now?

16:29.572 --> 16:31.539
Writing your memoirs?

16:31.641 --> 16:33.007
- A letter...

16:33.109 --> 16:34.442
- To whom?

16:34.544 --> 16:37.078
Let me guess, not
your grandmother.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.846
- Dear Pablo.

16:38.948 --> 16:42.283
- "Thank
you for your generosity
I'm very happy, so,

16:42.385 --> 16:44.952
no point in you
troubling yourself to visit."

16:45.055 --> 16:47.155
What the hell
does that mean?

16:47.257 --> 16:50.591
- Sounds like she
doesn't want to see you.

16:51.327 --> 16:54.762
- Get the car.

17:06.076 --> 17:07.575
- Pablo.

17:10.346 --> 17:11.546
- Where is she?

17:11.647 --> 17:13.047
- Francoise?
She's out for a walk.

17:13.148 --> 17:14.715
- Why did she
tell me not to come?

17:14.818 --> 17:17.218
- I have no idea what...
- Has she found someone else?

17:17.319 --> 17:19.087
Or are you poisoning
her against me?

17:19.189 --> 17:20.688
- Why in God's name?

17:20.790 --> 17:24.258
- Maybe you are jealous
that I chose her and not you.

17:27.564 --> 17:30.698
I could fix that.

17:38.108 --> 17:39.407
- What's going on?

17:39.509 --> 17:42.310
- Picasso
tried to seduce me.

17:44.547 --> 17:46.247
- I'm sorry
for snapping at you.

17:46.349 --> 17:50.451
It's just, we came here
to escape the snobs and
pretenders of Paris,

17:51.421 --> 17:53.187
so when you read to
me about Pieret and...

17:53.289 --> 17:55.723
- I understand.

17:56.059 --> 17:57.892
- It's different here.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.863
We Spaniards are
simple, warm, welcoming.

18:05.034 --> 18:07.735
What if we stayed
a bit longer?

18:10.073 --> 18:12.673
- Stop that!
- Shame on you!

18:13.176 --> 18:14.609
- What?

18:14.711 --> 18:16.744
Is a man not allowed
to express his
love for his woman?

18:16.846 --> 18:20.381
- She's not your wife!
- Whore!

18:23.319 --> 18:24.752
- What in God's name!

18:24.854 --> 18:26.287
- Come on.

18:26.389 --> 18:29.023
- Sinners, sacrilege!

18:32.328 --> 18:35.296
- Yes, the Spanish
are very warm and welcoming.

18:35.398 --> 18:37.698
.

18:39.736 --> 18:42.603
- What is it?

18:45.108 --> 18:47.708
- Have you ever
seen anything like that?

18:48.344 --> 18:50.578
- A statue
of Mary and Jesus?

18:50.680 --> 18:53.314
I've seen a few.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.483
- This one is different.

18:55.585 --> 18:57.952
The wood. The contours.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.987
It must be centuries old.

19:00.089 --> 19:03.424
Iberian, I suppose...

19:08.598 --> 19:10.331
It's a sign.

19:10.433 --> 19:13.768
- Of what?

19:16.873 --> 19:19.941
- We should have a baby.

19:20.310 --> 19:22.877
- There's
nothing in the world I
would like more than

19:22.979 --> 19:25.646
to have a family
with you, Pablo.

19:25.748 --> 19:29.417
But I can't.

19:31.221 --> 19:34.488
When I was with my husband...
I got pregnant.

19:36.459 --> 19:39.393
But I couldn't imagine
what that horrible man
could do to a child.

19:39.495 --> 19:44.732
So I... I found a doctor...
it went wrong.

19:47.737 --> 19:51.572
And now I can never...

19:52.508 --> 19:56.210
I understand if you don't
want to be with me anymore.

19:56.312 --> 20:03.084
- Fernande,
you're my muse.

20:03.186 --> 20:06.020
I need you.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.322
- But I'll
never be able to give
you what you want.

20:08.424 --> 20:12.493
- Oh, you already do.
Every day.

20:12.595 --> 20:15.496
And today is no different.

20:15.598 --> 20:18.232
You brought me here.

20:18.334 --> 20:24.171
And now, because of you,
I know how to finish
my portrait of Gertrude.

20:33.049 --> 20:35.683
- It looks
nothing like me.

20:35.785 --> 20:39.487
- Maybe not
today, but it will.

20:51.701 --> 20:53.701
- That's an awfully
prominent spot.

20:53.803 --> 20:56.037
- I thought
you liked Picasso.

20:56.139 --> 20:57.805
- He's no Matisse.

20:57.907 --> 21:01.042
Henri's not going
to like this...

21:01.377 --> 21:05.913
- What happened
when Pablo first saw Henri's
portrait hanging on our wall?

21:07.083 --> 21:09.216
- He offered to paint you.
So what?

21:09.319 --> 21:12.019
- Well, what do you
think Matisse will do when
he sees Pablo's portrait

21:12.121 --> 21:15.389
hanging above his own?

21:18.461 --> 21:20.061
- He'll try to outdo him.

21:20.163 --> 21:23.831
- They make
each other better.

21:30.340 --> 21:33.174
- Henri,
you have a visitor.

21:33.943 --> 21:36.444
- Ah, Monsieur Picasso.
Welcome.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.613
And, uh, I see you've
already met Monsieur Braque.

21:41.117 --> 21:45.186
He is the... why, he's
the youngest of the 'Wild
Beasts,' as they call us.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.458
I saw your
portrait of Gertrude.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.626
It is captivating, huh.

21:52.729 --> 21:56.197
A bold, uh, a bold
challenge to the classical
notions of the female form.

21:57.266 --> 21:58.966
.

21:59.068 --> 22:01.135
You should be very proud.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.471
- Thank you.

22:03.573 --> 22:07.942
- Mm. Gertrude's face
did seem strikingly familiar
to me, but I couldn't place it.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.712
And then it dawned on me.

22:12.715 --> 22:17.918
She looked just like my
African friend who inspired
my 'Bonheur de Vivre.' Hm.

22:20.890 --> 22:24.925
- Are you accusing
me of copying you?

22:25.595 --> 22:27.561
- Of course not.
We are artists.

22:27.663 --> 22:30.798
We must inspire each other.

22:32.001 --> 22:35.803
- Your African
sculpture had nothing to do
with my portrait of Gertrude.

22:37.306 --> 22:41.008
My influences are
purely Iberian.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.111
I am Spanish.

22:44.447 --> 22:48.482
- Yes, and, uh,
it seems you have quite
the Spanish temper. Hm.

22:51.487 --> 22:53.521
- How can you write to
me and tell me not to come?

22:53.623 --> 22:55.489
- You say you want
to be with me and only me,

22:55.591 --> 22:58.159
and then you try and take
my best friend to bed?

22:58.261 --> 23:01.262
- Oh, please.
It was a joke.

23:01.364 --> 23:03.564
You French, you don't
have sense of humor.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.033
- That's because
you're not funny, Pablo.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.202
- Fine. You
want to know the truth?

23:08.304 --> 23:09.904
I was trying to offend her.

23:10.006 --> 23:12.039
So she would go and you
and I could be alone.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.075
- That is ridiculous.

23:14.177 --> 23:16.677
- Because you make
me do ridiculous things!

23:16.779 --> 23:18.846
- I told you I
needed time to think...

23:18.948 --> 23:21.882
- It's been weeks!
And I have missed you.

23:22.285 --> 23:24.285
I couldn't wait any longer.

23:24.387 --> 23:28.122
- And you think you're
going to get what you want
by backing me into a corner.

23:31.727 --> 23:35.696
- Just give me a
chance to show you how
life can be with me.

23:37.567 --> 23:39.200
We-We are never
alone in Paris.

23:39.302 --> 23:41.268
Not for more than a few hours.

23:41.370 --> 23:45.439
Just, please, stay
for a few days.

23:45.541 --> 23:49.343
If I don't make you happy...
I will go.

23:53.249 --> 23:55.282
- Please
don't leave like this.

23:55.384 --> 23:58.219
- You should
come with me, Francoise.

23:58.321 --> 24:01.522
- I can't.

24:01.891 --> 24:04.758
- You're
headed for disaster.

24:15.321 --> 24:19.156
that
purple blouse of yours.

24:19.258 --> 24:22.426
And the willow green slacks.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.962
- That's
quite specific.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.364
- I have a
surprise for you.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.577
- Whose
house is this?

24:39.679 --> 24:41.846
- An old
friend of mine.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.949
Henri, can you guess
who Francoise's
favorite artist is?

24:45.751 --> 24:48.519
- Oh,
but of course. You.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.555
- No, in fact, it's you.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.527
- No...

24:56.929 --> 24:58.462
- Yeah. Look at him.

24:58.564 --> 25:01.131
You made him blush.
Look at him, look. Look.

25:01.234 --> 25:02.766
- Hand me my
sketch pad, Pablo.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.002
Mademoiselle, please
take a seat by the window.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.305
- No, no,
no-no-no, she's not
here to pose for you.

25:09.642 --> 25:13.444
- Oh, why should
you be the only one who
gets to paint her, huh?

25:13.546 --> 25:16.881
- Actually,
Pablo never painted me.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.049
- Mm.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.751
- What, why not?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.386
- Well...

25:22.488 --> 25:26.023
- Yes, why not?

25:26.125 --> 25:29.994
- 'Cause you are
still an enigma to me.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.332
- I have never seen
you like this before, Pablo.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.937
Well, I-I know how
I would paint her.

25:42.408 --> 25:45.142
I would make her hair green.

25:45.478 --> 25:47.378
- Of course you would.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.681
To match the Persian rug
you would paint her on.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.250
- Huh. Bella. Bella.

25:53.352 --> 25:57.187
Better than making
her skin blue to match the
tasteless red tile floor

25:57.290 --> 26:00.758
that you would paint her on.

26:01.093 --> 26:05.629
- 40 years on,
and the great Henri Matisse
is still trying to outdo me.

26:06.299 --> 26:09.233
Come over here.
Un besito, un besito.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.802
Un besito, ay...

26:12.338 --> 26:14.605
- It's absolutely
stunning, Henri.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.608
You've reimagined the
female form again.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.543
What do you think, Mr. Braque?

26:19.645 --> 26:22.112
You proud to call Matisse
your fearless leader?

26:22.214 --> 26:23.681
.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.382
- Look at this painting.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.218
It is clear, no
one can follow him.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.087
- Hm.

26:30.189 --> 26:33.724
- I hate to say it,
but Matisse has done it. Again.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.927
.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.699
- I know what
you are doing.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.534
- What are
you talking about?

26:43.636 --> 26:47.738
- You're trying to make
me jealous so I'll outdo him.

26:50.543 --> 26:53.510
And I will.

26:54.380 --> 26:59.316
But first I need money
to rent a new studio.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.619
Mine has been taken
over by Fernande's junk.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.587
- Ah.

27:03.689 --> 27:08.258
- There's one
available on the floor above
us, but I can't afford it.

27:10.596 --> 27:15.032
- Consider it an
advance on your next painting.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.974
- It's obvious he
copied the face from
Iberian sculpture.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.310
After I told him about them.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.646
But Iberian art
belongs to Spain.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.482
- You're
goddamn right it does.

27:31.584 --> 27:34.184
- I didn't know
he went to Spain.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.421
- He saw them
at the Louvre.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.490
You idiot.

27:39.592 --> 27:43.560
And now he's being
celebrated as the great
modernist hero, again.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.698
- You are so funny.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.405
Hey, what are you doing?

27:57.243 --> 27:59.376
What the hell is
wrong with you?

27:59.478 --> 28:00.811
- Who was that?

28:00.913 --> 28:03.781
- Nobody, I
used to model for him.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.949
- Are you
sleeping with him?

28:06.052 --> 28:08.052
- No, Pablo, I'm not.

28:08.154 --> 28:12.089
But if you keep acting
like a child, maybe I will.

28:13.559 --> 28:16.360
- Those women
in Spain were right.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.229
You are a whore.

28:28.741 --> 28:31.241
- Pablo!
Pablo, let me out.

28:31.711 --> 28:35.379
- I will, as
soon as you prove that
I can trust you again.

28:35.481 --> 28:38.282
- You're insane. Pablo!

28:39.251 --> 28:41.251
.

28:44.457 --> 28:47.157
- Hello. Pablo.
Sorry to interrupt.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.860
- Pieret.
What the hell do you want?

28:49.962 --> 28:52.329
- I come bearing gifts.

28:55.468 --> 28:58.635
Consider these a token
of our new friendship.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.582
- You stole
them from the Louvre?

29:12.518 --> 29:14.051
- I liberated them.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.954
As you said, the Iberians
belong to Spain, yes?

29:17.289 --> 29:18.922
Who deserves them more?

29:19.024 --> 29:21.625
A dusty old museum, or
the greatest Spanish
painter in the world?

29:24.296 --> 29:25.729
The statues are a
gift, of course.

29:25.831 --> 29:28.866
But there is a small...
delivery fee, so to speak.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.971
50 francs.

29:45.484 --> 29:49.019
- Wasn't that
a wonderful day?

29:49.355 --> 29:52.823
- It was
perfect, thank you.

29:56.729 --> 30:00.164
- Hey, move in with me.

30:04.303 --> 30:08.205
Think how wonderful
it would be.

30:08.307 --> 30:12.843
We could wake up together,
and eat together,
and make art together.

30:17.016 --> 30:20.050
- That sounds
wonderful but I don't
think I'm ready for it.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.286
And even if I were, I...

30:22.388 --> 30:23.954
I couldn't abandon
my grandmother.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.523
- Well, but I need
you more than she does.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.860
- Oh, she's
done everything for me.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.830
It would break her heart.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.866
- Yeah, but, uh,
don't you deserve to be happy?

30:35.968 --> 30:38.368
- I do.

30:38.470 --> 30:42.506
- There's a price
for everything, Francoise.

30:42.608 --> 30:46.143
To create, you must destroy.

30:46.712 --> 30:50.914
After all, the genius of
Einstein leads to Hiroshima.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.987
- You're the devil.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.756
- Huh. Is that so?

31:00.693 --> 31:04.995
Well, if I am the devil,

31:06.899 --> 31:11.134
then I should
burn you with hellfire?

31:17.309 --> 31:19.509
No. I would-I would never.
I would never.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.211
I love your face too much.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.046
Hey, Francoise!

31:23.148 --> 31:25.215
- I want
to go back to Paris.

31:25.317 --> 31:29.620
- Uh, I, I forgot that
you French cannot take a joke!

31:37.696 --> 31:40.964
- Fire, get out, fire!

31:43.836 --> 31:47.504
- Help, help
me, I'm locked in!

31:49.808 --> 31:50.741
- What happened?

31:50.843 --> 31:52.709
- Kitchen fire in
Leger's studio.

31:52.811 --> 31:55.145
We stopped it
before it spread.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.754
- Fernande!
Oh, thank God.

32:03.856 --> 32:04.955
- Where were you?

32:05.057 --> 32:07.124
I was trapped, you
could have killed me!

32:07.226 --> 32:08.959
- I'm sorry, my love.
I, I'm so sorry.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.260
I, I was at Apollinaire's!

32:10.362 --> 32:11.628
- I am
not your prisoner!

32:11.730 --> 32:13.764
- Of course
not, of course not.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.766
I made a mistake.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.702
I don't know what I
would do if I lost you.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.038
- You already have...

32:21.140 --> 32:24.508
- Please, please,
don't leave me.

32:26.312 --> 32:29.546
I do ridiculous
things because I love you.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.949
Help me change.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.216
I'll give you
whatever you want.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.887
We'll... we'll have a family!

32:36.989 --> 32:39.556
- Now you're
just being cruel.

32:39.658 --> 32:43.493
You know perfectly
well that I can't.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.196
- There's another way.

32:49.201 --> 32:52.836
.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.087
- What's her name?

33:10.189 --> 33:12.155
- Raymonde.

33:12.257 --> 33:15.792
- She reminds me
of my sister Conchita.

33:25.137 --> 33:31.408
¶ ¶

33:35.581 --> 33:37.280
What's your favorite color?

33:37.383 --> 33:38.882
- Green.

33:38.984 --> 33:41.785
- Do you know
how we make green?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.991
Give me your hand.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.336
¶ ¶

33:59.438 --> 34:02.773
Magic.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.443
- I have
a green dress.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.413
We can hem it and you
can wear it to school.

34:09.514 --> 34:13.449
- You see?
It'll be such fun here.

34:17.623 --> 34:21.091
Don't worry, we're going
to be a very happy family.

34:23.429 --> 34:27.531
- Raymonde, let me
show you where you will sleep.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.708
- Pablo, what
are we doing here?

34:39.812 --> 34:44.380
I asked you to take me home.
Whose apartment is this?

34:49.121 --> 34:51.254
- What do you want?

34:51.356 --> 34:53.723
- Tell her.

34:53.826 --> 34:55.458
- Tell her what?

34:55.561 --> 34:58.095
- That we are
not together anymore.

34:58.197 --> 35:02.566
- Pablo,
I'm so sorry.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.603
- For what? It's true.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.638
We are not together anymore.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.707
He's all yours.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.410
- You see?
Now we can go.

35:13.512 --> 35:17.714
- You should know,
uh, Pablo has never really
loved anyone in his life.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.151
He doesn't know how.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.253
- How can you
say such a thing?

35:23.355 --> 35:27.324
- He will get tired
of you the way he gets tired
of every woman he falls for.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.060
When it happens,
don't be hurt.

35:30.162 --> 35:34.231
It won't be your fault.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.833
- Come.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.075
Françoise, Françoise!

35:45.177 --> 35:47.177
- How could
you be so cruel to her?

35:47.279 --> 35:49.079
- But I did it for you.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.615
So you would trust
me when I say that I am
completely devoted to you.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.751
- Pablo,
you're a monster!

35:54.853 --> 35:56.620
- How dare you.

35:56.722 --> 36:00.857
After all I have done, I
should throw you in the river.

36:01.193 --> 36:04.528
- Go ahead. I can swim.

36:05.597 --> 36:09.399
- I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:14.106 --> 36:18.275
I don't know why
I am like this.

36:21.647 --> 36:24.648
I love you.

36:25.784 --> 36:29.085
I don't mean to
hurt you, I am... I'm sorry.

36:30.222 --> 36:33.123
Françoise, Françoise.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.725
Françoise, please,
look, listen, help me.

36:35.827 --> 36:40.130
Help me, help me, help
me to be a better man.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.602
Françoise, please.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.218
- What do you want?

37:01.320 --> 37:03.720
- I am just
here to say hello.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.022
You haven't
surfaced in months.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.724
- Why do
you care, Braque?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.659
We barely know each other.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.762
- I would
like to change that.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.799
I really do admire your work.

37:17.803 --> 37:21.204
Everyone's been talking
about your big painting.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.807
May I see?

37:25.510 --> 37:28.178
- It is not
ready to be seen.

37:33.952 --> 37:37.087
- Those are
magnificent busts.

37:37.189 --> 37:38.555
Where did you get them?

37:38.657 --> 37:40.223
- Spain.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.459
- Ah.

37:42.561 --> 37:46.963
Their primitive expressions
remind me of, um, the African
masks at the Trocadero Museum.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.132
Have you been?

37:49.234 --> 37:52.402
- I'm not
interested in African art.

37:52.504 --> 37:57.040
- But these masks,
they are not like, um,
Matisse's wood carvings.

37:57.142 --> 38:01.678
They are something
else entirely.

38:03.148 --> 38:06.750
I think you would
find them inspiring.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.754
Well, I'm sorry
to have bothered.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.574
- I thought we were done.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.643
- Oh. I'm sorry...

38:33.745 --> 38:35.345
- Raymonde!

38:35.447 --> 38:37.013
I, I thought you
were someone else.

38:37.115 --> 38:40.116
Please. Come in, come in.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.197
Do you like to paint?

38:54.299 --> 38:56.266
- The
nuns never let us.

38:56.368 --> 38:59.402
They said it
make too much mess.

39:00.739 --> 39:04.074
- Well, a mess
doesn't bother me.

39:13.251 --> 39:18.755
When I was young, my
father taught me that to
be a really good painter,

39:19.658 --> 39:22.826
you must first
learn how to draw.

39:24.296 --> 39:27.597
He was right.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.234
Master the rules, so you
know how to break them.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.375
- I know what
you're going to say...

39:38.477 --> 39:43.313
that I'm a silly girl who's
thinking about making the
biggest mistake of her life.

39:43.949 --> 39:47.384
- I was going
to say that you're as
stubborn as your father.

39:47.486 --> 39:50.220
- Well, he trained
me for Pablo, I suppose.

39:50.322 --> 39:55.425
- That doesn't
mean that you have to
spend your life with him.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.894
- But he needs me.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.997
He's troubled.
And I do love him.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.599
- You're young.

40:02.701 --> 40:06.202
You'll fall in
love many times.

40:06.304 --> 40:09.539
- Not like this.

40:19.484 --> 40:25.889

40:35.867 --> 40:41.905

40:51.817 --> 40:57.487

40:58.156 --> 41:02.392
- Take off your dress.

41:12.037 --> 41:17.907

41:27.919 --> 41:33.957
¶ ¶

41:43.869 --> 41:49.472
¶ ¶

41:50.775 --> 41:54.377
You can put your
dress back on.

41:56.081 --> 41:59.716
I'm ready to paint you now.

42:02.420 --> 42:05.388
- I put
Raymonde to bed.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.736
What is this?

42:19.838 --> 42:22.972
- A sketch.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.074
- You drew
Raymonde naked?

42:25.176 --> 42:27.210
- I'm an artist.
I draw nudes.

42:27.312 --> 42:29.546
- She's a child, Pablo.
Our child.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.382
- And she's not
embarrassed about herself.
So what?

42:32.484 --> 42:35.885
- Well, this is
always how it starts.

42:35.987 --> 42:39.589
First you paint her
beautifully, just like
you used to paint me...

42:43.528 --> 42:46.296
Then you turn
her into a whore.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.302
.

42:52.637 --> 42:56.773
- How dare you.
I brought Raymonde here.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.441
For you.

42:58.543 --> 43:01.678
Because I, because I love you.

43:01.780 --> 43:06.349
Now you accuse me
of God knows what.

43:11.389 --> 43:14.390
- I'm sorry.

43:14.492 --> 43:16.092
I know you would
never hurt her.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.027
- Of course I wouldn't!

43:18.129 --> 43:22.231
- But we both
know what happens to girls
who grow up around here.

43:25.804 --> 43:29.138
- We will protect her.

43:29.507 --> 43:33.009
- What happens
when we're not home?

43:33.345 --> 43:37.080
Some drunk artist staggers
in from down the hall.

43:39.884 --> 43:43.252
This was a mistake.

43:44.356 --> 43:48.591
You and I both know this
is no place for a child.

43:50.662 --> 43:53.396
- The world
is an ugly place.

43:53.498 --> 43:56.833
Our friend Matisse,
he paints beautifully.

43:57.936 --> 44:02.338
But painting isn't just
about portraying beauty.

44:03.141 --> 44:07.043
I learned that lesson
around the time I was
losing my first love.

44:09.047 --> 44:12.382
When I discovered
the Trocadero Museum.

44:13.852 --> 44:17.120
It was revolting.

44:17.455 --> 44:20.189
The smell.

44:20.291 --> 44:23.326
I wanted to get out.

44:23.428 --> 44:25.094
But I stayed.

44:25.196 --> 44:29.098
And then I saw them.

44:29.701 --> 44:33.236
Dozens of them.

44:34.606 --> 44:39.242
I saw right away that
they weren't like
Matisse's statues.

44:39.611 --> 44:41.644
You know, they
weren't art at all.

44:41.746 --> 44:44.781
They were magic.

44:53.158 --> 44:56.592
- I felt that
everything was hostile.

44:57.629 --> 45:03.933
Women. Children.
Animals. Everything.

45:14.846 --> 45:21.651
¶ ¶

45:23.088 --> 45:27.190
I finally understood
what those masks meant.

45:28.026 --> 45:33.362
They were weapons to
protect against evil.

45:37.669 --> 45:41.838
I grasped why I was an artist.

45:42.173 --> 45:46.542
My brush was my weapon.

45:56.387 --> 46:02.992
¶ ¶

46:17.642 --> 46:20.877
My shield. My protector.

46:23.648 --> 46:26.849
I knew what to do.

46:37.362 --> 46:40.830
I had to find the ugliness
beneath the beauty.

46:48.072 --> 46:51.607
You want to see?

47:08.226 --> 47:11.260
- But Pablo,
it's beautiful.

47:12.463 --> 47:17.600
- That's how I see you.

47:17.702 --> 47:20.436
You are different
than the others.

47:20.538 --> 47:24.106
You see the beauty
beneath my ugliness.

47:30.815 --> 47:33.316
- Is this a joke?

47:33.418 --> 47:37.587
- That is the most
astute art critique you
have ever given, Gertrude.

47:38.122 --> 47:40.456
- Mm-hm.

47:47.131 --> 47:50.399
Chin up, you're only 26.

47:51.803 --> 47:55.371
Matisse didn't hit his
stride until he was 35.

48:13.625 --> 48:17.193
- For God's
sake, Guillaume.

48:17.295 --> 48:20.563
You always have an opinion.

48:20.665 --> 48:23.299
Say something.

48:28.673 --> 48:32.675
- I'm
sorry, my friend.

48:36.714 --> 48:41.217
I don't think you want
to hear it this time.

48:46.891 --> 48:50.059
- Well.
Congratulations.

48:51.296 --> 48:52.595
- For what?

48:52.697 --> 48:54.931
- You said
you wanted to offend.

48:55.033 --> 48:57.733
Be abhorrent.

48:57.835 --> 49:00.903
You've done it.

49:24.062 --> 49:25.795

49:25.897 --> 49:28.831
- If your work
doesn't give you trouble,
it won't be good.

49:29.500 --> 49:33.336
Francoise, where
could she have gone?

49:35.039 --> 49:37.940
- We have to rip
everything apart to create a
new kind of painting.

49:38.042 --> 49:39.909
- You are working
