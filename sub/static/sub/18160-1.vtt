Stay right here.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.720
I'll tell you when.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.123
Slower. Back it up.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.593
Keep going.
A little bit more, like three feet.

- Yeah, yeah.

01:12.872 --> 01:16.930
- KATIE: What the fuck is in this box?
- Um, I think it's like kitchen stuff.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.860
Like plates and pots and shit.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.538
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

01:25.618 --> 01:29.509
- You got it?
- How many flights do we need?

01:29.889 --> 01:32.207
Those dudes are still there.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.755
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:42.835 --> 01:46.126
- Don't break the banister, dude.
- I know, I know.

01:47.306 --> 01:49.729
KATIE: It kind of sucks that
we're on the M line, honestly.

01:49.809 --> 01:53.633
You know how long it's gonna fucking take me
to get to work? It's gonna take me an hour.

01:54.513 --> 01:57.241
I'm just glad we have our own rooms.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.674
Yeah, but...

02:05.354 --> 02:07.974
I'm going to miss snuggling with you.

02:08.594 --> 02:10.852
We could still snuggle.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.820
Yeah?

02:14.400 --> 02:17.289
- KATIE: I promise.
- Good.

03:02.748 --> 03:05.638
- Have you ever been jumped though?
- I got jumped freshman year.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.474
- LEAH: You did? Are you serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.843
LEAH: By whom?

03:10.523 --> 03:12.478
- I was on my way to a show.
- LEAH: Yeah?

03:12.558 --> 03:15.081
- Yep.
- LEAH: And?

03:15.161 --> 03:19.185
This kid fucking asked me for a cigarette
and then he jumped me for my skateboard.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.856
- LEAH: What a dick.
- No, I'm serious. It wasn't even my board.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.758
Did you not have a cigarette
for him or something?

03:24.838 --> 03:27.560
No, I had a cigarette and I gave him
a cigarette. Then he followed me...

03:27.640 --> 03:30.863
BOY: I don't know. I'd rather live in dorms
than, live in a weird area like this.

03:30.943 --> 03:32.333
LEAH: Why?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.534
KATIE: I mean,
it's kind of creepy, but like...

03:34.614 --> 03:38.039
BOY: I mean, seriously,
when I got off the train on my way...

03:38.119 --> 03:41.775
KATIE: Yeah, I think we're kind
of out of weed, man. We're out.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.844
- They have weed.
- KATIE: Who?

03:44.924 --> 03:47.947
- What?
- They have weed.

03:48.027 --> 03:51.684
- KATIE: So?
- So, I'm going to go get some.

LEAH: I was wondering if you guys knew
where I could get some weed? Or something.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.159
What, you think we're some
drug dealers or something, Ma?

04:35.981 --> 04:37.662
No.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.001
I just thought you guys
might be able to hook me up.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.203
Nah, for real, Shorty.

04:44.283 --> 04:47.373
You can't be coming around here
asking strangers like that.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.311
All right?

04:51.057 --> 04:53.143
Are you serious?

04:54.226 --> 04:56.313
Do I look serious?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.537
Hey, Shorty.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.003
Don't do drugs, all right?

05:33.332 --> 05:36.155
- No.
- KELLY: Why not?

05:36.235 --> 05:40.326
- Do you work here?
- Yeah, yeah. I mean, I... just...

05:40.406 --> 05:43.696
KELLY: What are you...
what are we paying you for, then?

05:44.276 --> 05:46.466
Well, you're not paying me.

05:46.546 --> 05:49.769
What? Guys, can I have
your attention, please?

05:49.849 --> 05:54.907
This young lady loves this magazine
so much that she will work for free.

05:54.987 --> 05:58.177
I'm just kidding. Hey, will you help me
with something real quick?

05:58.257 --> 05:59.992
- Yeah.
- KELLY: Yeah. It's all right.

06:00.072 --> 06:01.681
You won't get in trouble, I promise.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.784
- LEAH: Okay.
- KELLY: Watch the pole. It's a killer.

06:05.464 --> 06:07.854
Let me know what you think.

06:11.334 --> 06:14.359
- What I think?
- Yeah.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.998
Well, I mean...

06:19.078 --> 06:22.802
Very interesting.
That is a very interesting answer.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.769
I agree.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.249
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.751
How rude of me.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.581
Where are my manners? Would you like some?

06:56.549 --> 06:58.837
Do another if you want.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.679
Great.

- KELLY: Uh...

08:25.466 --> 08:27.927
that is Rambo.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.864
You know Rambo... graffiti artist?
He's painting now.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.866
I bought, like, 10 of these,
trying to drive the price up.

08:33.946 --> 08:39.138
That reminds me. Can we do a little piece
on Rambo? Try to drive the prices up?

08:39.217 --> 08:42.607
- Good idea.
- KELLY: Do you know Leah?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.444
- Hey, Leah.
- Hi.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.180
KELLY: Yeah, she was gracing me
with her art history knowledge.

08:48.260 --> 08:52.462
Were you saying something about being
more visceral than the street thing?

08:53.832 --> 08:57.456
- We have a sponsor call in 15.
- Uh, shit.

08:57.536 --> 09:01.193
Can we move that to 3:00, please?

09:01.273 --> 09:04.404

I'm Blue.

10:04.303 --> 10:07.827
- That's your real name?
- Maybe.

10:08.807 --> 10:11.197
Well, why do they call you that?

10:11.677 --> 10:13.907
Because I'm always sad.

Before I met you.

10:40.239 --> 10:43.148
Sorry. One second.

10:47.613 --> 10:51.136
- What is he doing here?
- I have to ask to invite someone over?

10:51.216 --> 10:54.140
KATIE: Leah, it's not anybody.
It's the fucking dude who sits on the corner

10:54.220 --> 10:57.610
- because he's probably a fucking drug dealer.
- LEAH: Of course he's a drug dealer.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.678
And he's nice. Trust me.

comes out here bugging out.

Can you pull up the guest list for me?

17:39.324 --> 17:41.047
Sure.

17:42.027 --> 17:47.387
All right. Can we take Jason McDonald
off there? He's out of town.

17:48.267 --> 17:52.740
And then, give Sophie Goodnight a plus 1

17:52.820 --> 17:57.096
and then Cream should be in press.
So move him over.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.665
Move him over.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.868
- You know how to do that?
- Yep.

18:02.948 --> 18:06.438
Okay. And you just deleted him.

18:06.918 --> 18:11.104
All right. Well, it's all right.
Just fix it and then at 5:00...

18:11.184 --> 18:14.780
lock it up and print it out.
And I'll see you there.

I assume a girl like you
probably got a man.

Hey, Jerry. Does that look

- Uh, yeah.

24:18.223 --> 24:20.679
Pull my sleeve, please.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.602
This is why I hate jumpers.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.490
So what, are you fucking
one of these guys?

24:31.570 --> 24:35.393
Um, well, they sell drugs on our corner.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.863
He needs to know that.

40:45.983 --> 40:47.747
So...

40:48.568 --> 40:50.257
you'll get out.

40:51.414 --> 40:53.437
BLUE: Uh, no.

40:53.517 --> 40:55.723
Shorty, this is my third strike.

40:56.653 --> 40:59.912
If I talked, I could walk,
but I ain't doing that shit.

41:01.692 --> 41:04.736
How the fuck could I fuck up
right when I met you?

41:06.731 --> 41:10.639
I told you we're going to figure it out.

41:17.207 --> 41:19.345
Is that what you think, Shorty?

41:22.346 --> 41:24.855
I always figure it out.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.782
You crazy.

41:38.862 --> 41:41.106
POLICEMAN: Hey, sit back.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.903
Nice. Fucking coke
is pouring out of your bag.

41:58.983 --> 42:01.371
LEAH:
Maybe we should have put it in your pussy.

42:01.451 --> 42:04.096
KATIE:
I'm sure there's much more room in yours.

42:04.689 --> 42:09.316
Look, this is it. So don't be a bitch.
Just smile and don't say anything, all right?

42:09.396 --> 42:12.173
I hate this neighborhood.
This is going to be quick, right?

42:13.597 --> 42:15.085
- What?
- LEAH: Shit.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.921
What the fuck, come on. Come on.
Walk with me. Come on.

42:18.001 --> 42:20.023
KATIE: Dude, what the fuck?
You just said we were there.

42:20.103 --> 42:22.315
- Walk. Walk.
- (KATIE TALKS INDISTINCTLY)

42:41.558 --> 42:44.315
He's actually a really
good person, you know?

42:44.395 --> 42:48.194
I mean, his grandmother is sick
and he has to pay for her medicine

42:48.274 --> 42:50.755
and he has to pay to support her.

42:51.735 --> 42:56.093
And he was actually thinking
of stopping before this happened.

42:56.173 --> 43:00.351
And it was an undercover cop
who set him up, you know, with...

43:00.431 --> 43:03.000
set him up with an old friend, actually.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.705
But he didn't actually make the sale.

43:07.785 --> 43:11.975
He just set it down. So that's something.

43:12.055 --> 43:17.128
But the thing that is the most unfair,
I think, is just that, I mean,

43:17.208 --> 43:21.786
the lawyer that the jail provided him with
hasn't even come to visit him yet.

43:22.466 --> 43:24.822
What's your relationship?

43:25.202 --> 43:27.444
LEAH: Our... our relationship?

43:28.806 --> 43:30.861
How do you know him?

43:30.941 --> 43:33.551
LEAH: Well, he's my lawyer... I...

43:34.241 --> 43:36.260
I mean, my neighbor...

43:36.607 --> 43:40.237
GEORGE:
So you just want to help your neighbor?

43:40.317 --> 43:43.587
Well, I can't just sit by
and watch him go to jail

43:43.667 --> 43:46.251
because he can't afford a good lawyer.

43:47.024 --> 43:48.860
I want to help.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.416
Well, okay.

43:52.496 --> 43:55.592
It does make a big difference to the judge
when someone's there in court

43:55.672 --> 43:59.936
and actually cares about the person
and is vouching for him,

44:00.016 --> 44:03.327
especially if that someone looks like you.

44:03.407 --> 44:07.613
The quantity of heroine and crack cocaine
that your friend was caught with

44:07.693 --> 44:11.294
was small, but significant.

44:12.716 --> 44:15.873
That, plus the two prior arrests

44:15.953 --> 44:18.877
are going to put your friend in the...

44:18.957 --> 44:22.713
unfortunate position
of doing some real time.

44:22.793 --> 44:24.835
I would say he's...

44:25.805 --> 44:29.130
I don't know... five years, maybe more...

44:30.810 --> 44:35.692
depending on the details
of the first two arrests.

44:36.290 --> 44:40.598
But once I get the retainer,
I'll meet with your friend, we'll talk.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.534
We'll figure something out,
see what I can swing.

44:44.084 --> 44:46.304
There's always hope.

44:47.284 --> 44:49.373
LEAH: Thank you.

44:49.953 --> 44:53.043
And how much is the retainer, exactly?

44:53.123 --> 44:56.647
$2,500. And then we'll see
where it goes from there.

44:56.727 --> 45:01.970
Well, I can have that to you first thing
tomorrow, if that's all right.

45:02.766 --> 45:06.910
- That'd be great.
- LEAH: Um, well...

45:07.051 --> 45:11.061
thank you.
I really appreciate what you're doing.

45:11.141 --> 45:13.183
It's what I do.

45:16.446 --> 45:18.602
You go to college here in the city?

45:18.682 --> 45:21.672
Yeah, I'll start my second year
in a few weeks.

45:21.752 --> 45:23.574
GEORGE: Good for you.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.743
What are you studying?

45:26.123 --> 45:31.015
Um, right now, uh,
writing and liberal arts.

45:31.695 --> 45:34.915
- What do you want to do, though?
- Um...

45:34.995 --> 45:38.555
I don't know yet.
Uh, work in media, I guess.

45:38.635 --> 45:40.590
Media.

45:40.670 --> 45:42.293
Mm-hmm.

45:43.273 --> 45:46.196
- Thank you very, very much.
- All righty. Yep.

45:46.276 --> 45:48.781
- Have a good one.
- Yeah.

45:50.314 --> 45:52.470
LEAH: It's 10 ounces.

45:53.650 --> 45:57.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck is that?

45:57.955 --> 45:59.710
What, are you trafficking now?

45:59.790 --> 46:04.781
No, actually Blue is in jail,
so I'm selling this to pay for his lawyer.

46:05.161 --> 46:07.050
KELLY: Are you joking?

46:07.130 --> 46:09.954
He got set up by a fucking undercover cop.

46:11.134 --> 46:13.357
- Do you want it or not?
- (KELLY LAUGHS)

46:13.937 --> 46:17.862
- Do you want it or not?
- Not. Not.

46:17.942 --> 46:21.398
- Well, what about five ounces for $10,000?
- Fuck no.

46:21.478 --> 46:25.802
- What about four ounces for $8,000?
- No, I know how much he gets it for.

46:25.882 --> 46:28.072
What about two for $3,000?

46:29.352 --> 46:32.428
All right. Two for $3,000.
How do we do this?

46:38.562 --> 46:41.031
- That doesn't look very scientific.
- Whatever. It's just, like,

46:41.111 --> 46:44.277
a little less than half of half.

46:53.777 --> 46:55.333
(NENE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

46:57.313 --> 47:01.872
LEAH: All right. Katie? This is a gram bag,
so we're going to put 0.8 in it, you got it?

47:01.952 --> 47:04.341
LEAH: Can you put the joint down?
You're too fucking stoned.

47:04.421 --> 47:06.477
I can do it. I can do it. I can do it.

47:06.557 --> 47:10.181
Oh, you know what, y'all?
I'm feeling really tucking tight right now.

47:10.261 --> 47:13.850
How the fuck this nigga got us working
for him? He would never do this shit for us.

47:13.930 --> 47:16.950
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, he would. Yes, he would.

47:18.027 --> 47:20.991
- This nigga would never do that shit for me.
- LEAH: Yeah, he would.

47:21.071 --> 47:22.960
- No, the fuck he wouldn't.
- LEAH: Yes, he would.

47:23.040 --> 47:27.030
KILO: All I got to say, Shorty, is this nigga
mad lucky that he got you saving his ass.

47:27.110 --> 47:29.032
All right, guys. Smile for the camera.

47:29.112 --> 47:32.630
Smile. That's fucking sexy, Katie.

47:33.717 --> 47:36.001
- KATIE: Everybody say pussy.
- Whoo!

48:28.772 --> 48:33.117
What the fuck you doing taking out
this money, yo? Relax, man.

48:59.369 --> 49:00.724
My man, my man, my man.

49:00.804 --> 49:03.793
Don't fucking touch me like that.
Get the fuck off me.

49:03.873 --> 49:06.064
- Yo, what's up?
- What the fuck?

49:08.044 --> 49:10.334
LEAH: What are you doing?

49:11.514 --> 49:14.537
- This is fucking bullshit, man.
- Are you okay?

49:14.617 --> 49:18.508
- KILO: Yeah, I'm fine.
- That was crazy.

49:18.588 --> 49:20.777
Yo, I've been here twice already, man.

49:20.857 --> 49:23.447
Yo, I'm not fucking around
with this bullshit no more.

49:23.527 --> 49:25.716
Don't fucking come close
to me right now, all right.

49:25.796 --> 49:30.522
- Leah, take that.
- I'm sorry. I really didn't know.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.690
- You sorry?
- NENE: You're going to get us locked up.

49:33.770 --> 49:37.461
- I said that I am sorry.
- KILO: Yo, shut the fuck up, man.

49:37.541 --> 49:40.097
Leah, we should really just go home.

49:40.577 --> 49:44.609
Come on, everyone is freaking out
about some random thing, Katie.

49:49.786 --> 49:51.828
Come on!

51:08.665 --> 51:10.753
We're here.

51:10.833 --> 51:12.970
$17.

51:43.107 --> 51:45.156
LEAH: You scared me.

51:46.436 --> 51:49.659
Where's Blue? Where is he?

51:50.039 --> 51:53.029
- He got arrested.
- Did he have my stuff on him?

51:53.109 --> 51:57.033
Um, uh... I was actually
planning on coming...

51:57.113 --> 51:59.936
That's why you got rats outside my house?

52:00.016 --> 52:02.973
- He talk?
- No, he definitely didn't.

52:03.053 --> 52:07.111
He owes me $7,000.
Where the fuck's my money?

52:07.891 --> 52:10.647
I don't... I don't know.
I know that you'll get it, though.

52:10.727 --> 52:13.683
- You do or you don't know?
- I don't know.

52:13.763 --> 52:15.768
You don't know much, do you?

52:15.848 --> 52:19.433
- I'm sorry, I'm barely know him.
- It's cool.

52:20.636 --> 52:22.678
Everything's cool.

52:24.207 --> 52:26.264
(LEAH SQUEALS)

52:42.792 --> 52:46.350
I have built quite
the strong case for your friend.

52:46.830 --> 52:49.819
Clear evidence that he did not
technically make the sale.

52:49.899 --> 52:53.190
That, plus the fact that this
undercover cop, Mr. Macho,

52:53.270 --> 52:54.924
has been hitting it a little too hard.

52:55.004 --> 52:57.610
Now, it took me every connection
that I had to get that information,

52:57.690 --> 53:00.639
but now that I have it,
I'm not going to let up.

53:02.012 --> 53:05.135
That's... wonderful.

53:05.215 --> 53:09.106
GEORGE: Mm-hmm.
Now, here's the icing on the cake.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.740
We have a sympathetic judge.

53:10.820 --> 53:14.623
So that means this whole thing
may be tossed out on a technicality.

53:20.063 --> 53:22.718
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Really?

53:23.767 --> 53:26.639
- Happy?
- Yeah.

53:26.719 --> 53:29.326
- Thank you.
- Oh, okay.

53:29.806 --> 53:31.228
- All right.
- Thank you.

53:31.308 --> 53:33.563
Uh, don't forget this.

53:33.643 --> 53:36.652
- LEAH: Oh, thanks.
- GEORGE: You got it.

53:56.399 --> 53:58.221
What, Mom?

53:58.301 --> 54:00.890
Oh, yeah, the package. Yeah, I got it.

54:00.970 --> 54:03.927
Um, thank you. I'm sorry I haven't called.

54:04.007 --> 54:06.296
I've been so busy, you know,
with the internship

54:06.376 --> 54:08.765
and getting ready for school and stuff.

54:08.845 --> 54:12.035
I got into this painting class.
Yeah, I know, it's so great.

54:12.115 --> 54:14.304
But they were talking
about the extra supplies.

54:14.384 --> 54:17.684
And you know I don't want to
bother you for money, but...

54:18.242 --> 54:21.378
Wow. $200.

54:21.458 --> 54:26.307
Yeah. Yeah, that would be so great.

54:30.333 --> 54:34.207
I know, I... I know, I miss you, too.

54:38.641 --> 54:40.378
Mm-hmm.

54:42.412 --> 54:44.201
Mm-hmm.

54:45.181 --> 54:46.952
Mm-hmm.

55:45.708 --> 55:47.564
BLUE:
Today I wanted to read the paper, right?

55:47.644 --> 55:49.932
So I asked the guard
'cause he wasn't using his.

55:50.012 --> 55:53.002
This nigga wouldn't even look at me.
Like I wasn't even a fucking human being.

55:53.082 --> 55:55.539
You know what I'm saying?

55:55.619 --> 55:57.607
Whatever, then,
this boy-girl comes through, right?

55:57.687 --> 56:00.177
And she's like, hey, baby,
I got the paper. You want it?

56:00.257 --> 56:02.512
I was like, no, fuck out of here.
I don't want no fucking paper.

56:02.592 --> 56:04.280
- I'm good.
- LEAH: Why not?

56:04.360 --> 56:08.852
What, do I look crazy? I mean, they ran up
on this Chinese nigga yesterday for nothing.

56:08.932 --> 56:11.756
Emptied his whole cell out,
you know what I'm saying? All his food.

56:11.836 --> 56:15.626
They tried to give me that shit. I was like,
I don't want this kid's food. Get out of here.

56:16.106 --> 56:18.395
You have to eat.

56:18.475 --> 56:22.565
I mean, I eat the fruit, you know
what I'm saying? But that's it.

56:22.645 --> 56:26.503
Oh, well, yesterday, they made
chicken cutlets, so I ate some of that.

56:26.583 --> 56:28.971
But you know, that's it. It was all right.

56:29.051 --> 56:31.375
Do you like the lawyer okay?

56:32.055 --> 56:34.377
I mean, yeah, as a lawyer.

56:34.457 --> 56:37.247
But, Shorty, I can't pay him.

56:37.927 --> 56:40.917
Well, he's working pro bono.

56:41.664 --> 56:44.821
- What's that mean?
- LEAH: Like, for free.

56:46.801 --> 56:49.225
I told him about what happened to you.

56:49.305 --> 56:52.578
And he said he wanted to help, so.

56:55.878 --> 56:58.194
- You serious?
- Yeah.

56:58.274 --> 57:01.637
BLUE: That's fucking amazing. Free?

57:09.425 --> 57:11.681
I fucking love you.

57:11.961 --> 57:14.166
You know that, right?

57:21.771 --> 57:23.888
I, um...

57:26.216 --> 57:27.968
I...

57:29.148 --> 57:31.335
want to fuck you...

57:32.427 --> 57:34.750
so hard.

58:06.549 --> 58:08.639
You want some?

58:09.619 --> 58:11.356
No.

58:14.890 --> 58:17.892
Come here, what are you doing? Come here.

58:23.012 --> 58:26.122
I... I wanted to ask you.

58:26.202 --> 58:27.958
Yeah.

58:31.351 --> 58:36.190
I wanted to ask if you would, um...

58:38.681 --> 58:41.898
if you would consider letting me...

58:42.592 --> 58:45.108
borrow for, like...

58:45.188 --> 58:47.543
a very short time. I mean, just...

58:47.623 --> 58:49.560
How much?

58:50.827 --> 58:54.519
How much you need? What is that?

58:55.465 --> 58:57.821
$13,000? Jesus Christ.

58:57.901 --> 59:00.577
It's $13,000 for the lawyer,

59:00.657 --> 59:03.154
and then there's another $4,000
for the dealer, and...

59:03.234 --> 59:06.607
- The dealer, what dealer?
- I'll pay everyone back, but, well...

59:06.687 --> 59:09.801
the dealer...
the dealer knows where I live, Kelly,

59:09.881 --> 59:13.822
- so I don't know what I'm going to do.
- Okay, so then move.

59:15.551 --> 59:17.559
What happened to you?

59:20.523 --> 59:22.745
LEAH: Just fucking forget it.

59:23.225 --> 59:25.067
Hold on.

59:35.271 --> 59:37.442
How much you have left?

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.774
Sorry, everybody.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:18.320
I think I'm going to go dance.

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.547
You guys.

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:06.282
You guys!

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:10.005
