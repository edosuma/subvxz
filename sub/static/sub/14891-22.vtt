01:41.835 --> 01:44.304
I don’t wanna talk,
there’s a...

There’s a Woody Woodpecker

‐Balki, we have to talk now.
‐Oh, no.

For the past two weeks
all you’ve done is

02:10.263 --> 02:12.699

and watch TV.

I’m turning into a couch tomato?

Alright, Balki,
you can’t keep sitting

02:21.207 --> 02:23.544

02:23.577 --> 02:26.680
For your infomercial,
I am not depressed.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.850
I’m just sad. Okay.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.417
And, I’ve come to terms
with that.

There’s nothing wrong
with being sad.

with your life.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.748
Why is there a picture
of a dead man in it?

03:04.250 --> 03:07.554
That’s not a picture of a dead
man, that’s your reflection.

We gotta get out

here’s what we’re gonna do.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.208
I’m gonna give you
a little orientation.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.811
Maybe, get you started
in a conversation with somebody

talk back to you.

is a part of the game, okay.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.943
Don’t take it personally.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.411

‐See you back at home.
‐Bye.

the idea of taking me here.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.970

06:10.003 --> 06:13.139
You know, just, watch
the Woody Woodpecker Marathon.

‐Get out of the city!

06:21.481 --> 06:23.550

come home with me?

06:23.584 --> 06:24.818
I could make some hot chocolate

06:24.851 --> 06:27.721
and we could watch the end of
the Woody Woodpecker Marathon.

06:27.754 --> 06:28.989

06:29.022 --> 06:30.957
That is so refreshing.

I didn’t mean to be fresh.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.097
No, I‐I meant, it’s sweet.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.465
Balki, you may not believe this

06:39.499 --> 06:41.968
but you’re the first man to
offer me hot chocolate

06:42.002 --> 06:43.770
and a cartoon marathon.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.472
Is that a yes?

06:46.507 --> 06:49.042
It would be,
but I came with my friend, Beth

06:49.075 --> 06:50.911
’and I can’t leave without her.’

06:50.944 --> 06:54.681
Oh, do you, do you think
she would like to come with us?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.983
Probably. I think she’d
be happy to leave this place.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.484
She doesn’t really like it here.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.587
Oh, well,
if she don’t like it now

07:00.621 --> 07:02.488
just wait till
the caribou get here.

That must be Amy’s friend, Beth.

She wasn’t feeling very well,
so I told her that

10:10.744 --> 10:14.648
she could go upstairs and sleep
in the room right on the right.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.050
No one’s...
No one’s using that room.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.155
She must have gone
into the wrong room.

move her right now.

home? What happened?

11:10.036 --> 11:12.172
Well, my flight to New York
was three hours late

11:12.205 --> 11:14.708
when I got there the connecting
flight to London was cancelled

11:14.741 --> 11:16.176
so I had to wait around
the airport for six hours

11:16.209 --> 11:18.344
before I could
catch another flight home.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.246
All I want to do is
go to bed and forget

11:20.280 --> 11:21.314
this day ever happened.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.949

Well, yeah, I‐I guess
a little hot chocolate

11:49.209 --> 11:51.444
would help me relax.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.313

tell Balki you’re home early.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.447
