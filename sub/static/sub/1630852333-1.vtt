00:09.592 --> 00:12.470
- This is the story
of the greatest man

00:12.512 --> 00:15.473
to ever walk the earth,

00:15.515 --> 00:17.642
MacGruber.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.645
* He was
a military secret weapon *

00:20.687 --> 00:23.148
* America's favorite son *

00:23.189 --> 00:25.984
* Doing whatever it takes
to keep the country safe *

00:26.026 --> 00:28.653
* Been ripping throats out
just for fun *

00:28.695 --> 00:31.281
* His prowess
on the battlefield *

00:31.322 --> 00:34.451
* Was only equaled
in the sack *

00:34.492 --> 00:36.786
* He knew how to hump
and, baby, I should know *

00:36.828 --> 00:39.080
* I was his wife
so I humped him back *

00:39.122 --> 00:40.457
- [moaning]
- Wow.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.667
* But our marriage
lasted seven seconds *

00:42.709 --> 00:45.295
* 'Cause at the altar
as we pledged our love *

00:45.337 --> 00:48.381
* I was blown up
by MacGruber's nemesis *

00:48.423 --> 00:50.759
* The piece of shit named
Dieter von Cunth *

00:50.800 --> 00:53.345
* Then a bunch
of fucking years later *

00:53.386 --> 00:56.389
* Cunth hijacked
a nuclear bomb *

00:56.431 --> 00:59.142
* Well, Mac assembled a team
that was hungry and mean *

00:59.184 --> 01:02.354
* But they exploded in a van *
- [screaming]

01:02.395 --> 01:04.481
- * A backup team
was assembled *

01:04.522 --> 01:07.275
* Dixon Piper was
his right hand man *

01:07.317 --> 01:09.986
* And my best friend
Vicki St. Elmo *

01:10.028 --> 01:12.739
* Joined MacGruber
and they formed a plan *

01:12.781 --> 01:15.617
* But while they were
on the mission *

01:15.658 --> 01:18.370
* Mac and Vicki
both developed a crush *

01:18.411 --> 01:20.997
* They tracked down Cunth
and blew his compound up *

01:21.039 --> 01:23.458
* And in their spare time,
they boned a bunch *

01:23.500 --> 01:25.001
- [moans]
- * Their relationship *

01:25.043 --> 01:26.544
* Progressed super quickly *

01:26.586 --> 01:29.547
* They were the love
of each other's life *

01:29.589 --> 01:32.342
* And after more flirting
MacGruber was certain *

01:32.384 --> 01:35.136
* And he asked Vicki
to be his wife *

01:35.178 --> 01:37.639
* But just when you thought
everything was safe *

01:37.681 --> 01:40.642
* Cunth came back
from the dead *

01:40.684 --> 01:42.811
* And just like me,
he tried to kill Vicki *

01:42.852 --> 01:45.939
* On their motherfuckin'
wedding day *

01:45.980 --> 01:48.775
* But MacGruber fought hard
and killed that fucker *

01:48.817 --> 01:51.319
* And threw him off a cliff *

01:51.361 --> 01:52.779
* Then using Piper's gun *

01:52.821 --> 01:54.572
* Mac shot Cunth
full of holes *

01:54.614 --> 01:56.950
* And then pissed on
his smoldering corpse *

01:56.991 --> 01:59.911
* So spread the words,
ya frickin' turds *

01:59.953 --> 02:02.288
* MacGruber is the man *

02:02.330 --> 02:05.500
* Now you're all caught up
and you can watch the show *

02:05.542 --> 02:08.336
* Send complaints
to this woman Susanne *

02:08.378 --> 02:11.881
* *

02:17.053 --> 02:18.430
[peaceful music]

02:18.471 --> 02:20.849
[dog barks]
- [laughs]

02:20.890 --> 02:24.185
* *

02:24.227 --> 02:27.564
Go get it, Bailey.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.736
- Nightingale is secure.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.740
- She's all good,
Mr. President.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.367
- Thanks, Ronnie.
Hey, grab a cookie.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.036
- John, are you gonna
come help me

02:41.077 --> 02:44.205
or am I gonna have to decorate
this whole tree all by myself?

02:44.247 --> 02:46.708
- I'm sorry, hon.
I-I gotta finish up

02:46.750 --> 02:49.294
a little light reading
from the Joint Chiefs.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.837
- Bah humbug.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.672
[phone ringing]

02:55.342 --> 02:58.428
- North Pole, Santa speaking.
- [chuckles]

02:58.470 --> 03:01.639
- [distorted voice]
Hello, Mr. President.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.308
- Who the hell is this?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.893
[dramatic music]

03:04.934 --> 03:07.187
- Bailey...

03:07.228 --> 03:10.315
Bailey!

03:10.357 --> 03:14.819
- You take from me,
I take from you.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.072
[dial tone]

03:17.113 --> 03:18.114
- Lucy.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.076
* *

03:21.117 --> 03:22.952
- Bailey?

03:22.994 --> 03:29.959

03:31.127 --> 03:34.422
[screams]

03:34.464 --> 03:37.092
[alarm blaring]

03:37.133 --> 03:39.219
- Go, go, go!

03:39.260 --> 03:42.972
[tense music]

03:43.014 --> 03:44.808
[helicopter blades whirring]

03:44.849 --> 03:45.892

[flames crackling]

[dramatic music]

04:27.892 --> 04:30.145
* *

04:30.186 --> 04:31.688
- Are you sure about this, sir?

04:31.730 --> 04:33.606
- No, Major, I'm not.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.692
This son of a bitch
is our only hope.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.570
- And what if he says no?

04:38.611 --> 04:41.281
- Then God help us.

04:41.322 --> 04:45.660
* *

04:45.702 --> 04:48.079
- He's been in and out
of the special housing unit

04:48.121 --> 04:49.581
since he got here.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.167
He's what we like to call
a "problem inmate."

04:52.208 --> 04:53.668
- Why is that?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.503
- Let's just say...

04:55.545 --> 04:57.839
he doesn't play well
with others.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.888
- Shit.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.931
- Fuck it.
Just leave it, man.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.558
- I'll go get it.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.479
[eagle screeches]

05:12.520 --> 05:14.689
[dramatic music]

05:14.731 --> 05:17.859
- Are you trying
to steal my ball?

05:17.901 --> 05:19.694
See, it's on my side
of the yard,

05:19.736 --> 05:22.030
so, the way I see it,

05:22.072 --> 05:24.991
this is my ball now.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.203
Good news is,
I'm gonna let you keep it.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.871
The bad news?

05:29.913 --> 05:32.457
I'm gonna shove it up your ass.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.043
Do you like things up
your ass, boy?

05:35.085 --> 05:36.503
Huh?
I said,

05:36.544 --> 05:38.296
do you like
things up your ass?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.964
- I like things in my butt.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.133
[bell ringing]

05:42.175 --> 05:44.386
[electric guitar slide]

05:44.427 --> 05:47.055
- What the fuck you just say?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.391
[bell ringing]

05:49.432 --> 05:51.309
- Thought I was speaking
pretty clearly.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.854
[tense dramatic music]

05:54.896 --> 05:59.025
I said,
"I like things in my butt."

05:59.067 --> 06:00.735
* *

06:00.777 --> 06:02.237
So why don't you
leave the kid alone

06:02.278 --> 06:05.240
and come put your little
rubber ball up inside me?

06:05.281 --> 06:06.991
* *

06:07.033 --> 06:12.163
Did you hear that,
you fucking piece of shit?

06:12.205 --> 06:15.250
- You got a death wish, man?
- Why, are you a genie?

06:15.291 --> 06:18.169
- No, I'm the guy who's gonna
pound your fucking face in.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.131
- Nice to meet you, guy who's
gonna pound my fucking face in.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.674
My name is let the kid go

06:22.716 --> 06:25.385
or I'll kill you
and all your fucking friends

06:25.427 --> 06:27.137
Love Hewitt.

06:27.178 --> 06:30.765
But, hey, we're getting off
track here, bud.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.059
You got a perfectly nice ball,

06:33.101 --> 06:35.812
and I have a desire
to have that ball up my butt.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.064
So I guess
the only question is:

06:38.106 --> 06:41.693
are you gonna jam it up
there or am I?

06:41.735 --> 06:44.988
* *

06:45.030 --> 06:46.448
Lucky me.

06:46.489 --> 06:53.663

07:10.472 --> 07:12.474
We done here?

07:12.515 --> 07:15.477
[crowd shouting]

- [screaming]

07:18.396 --> 07:21.983
[indistinct shouting]

07:22.025 --> 07:24.069
- God damn it, Pierce.
Shut this down now.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.655
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute, son.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.116
I'd like to see this.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.659
[crowd cheering]

07:31.701 --> 07:34.871
[grunting]

07:36.122 --> 07:38.792
- Pretty satisfying
main course so far.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.294
Hope you saved room
for dessert.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.505
Or should I say...dis dirt!

07:43.546 --> 07:45.173
- [shouts]

07:45.215 --> 07:47.258

all: [chanting] Throat rip!
Throat rip, throat rip!

08:01.231 --> 08:03.400
- Is this what you want?

08:03.441 --> 08:06.194
- Yeah!
- Is it?

08:06.236 --> 08:07.237
- Shut it down.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.530
[gunshot]

08:08.571 --> 08:10.407
[crowd clamoring]

08:10.448 --> 08:12.242
[guards grunting]

08:12.283 --> 08:14.285
- Sorry, bud, but for you,

08:14.327 --> 08:16.705
that's all she throat.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.164
[screaming, Taser crackling]

[suspenseful music]

08:27.424 --> 08:34.347
* *

08:36.641 --> 08:38.560
- Well, well, well.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.854
If it isn't my old friend,

08:40.895 --> 08:43.106
Lieutenant Colonel
Barrett Fasoose.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.692
- [sighs]
It's General Fasoose now.

08:45.734 --> 08:49.112
- Sorry, General.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.697
Who's the cherry?

08:50.739 --> 08:54.367
- Major Harold Kernst, NSA.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

08:54.409 --> 08:57.412
- Save the fuckin'
Boy Scout shit for someone

08:57.454 --> 08:59.914
who gives a flying funk.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.833
- I'll cut to the chase.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.543
We need you, MacGruber.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.253
- Of course you do.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.339
- The government is prepared
to release you from prison,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.342
restore your pension,
and grant you a full pardon.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.926
- Oh, a full pardon!

09:11.968 --> 09:14.054
You mean, for a crime
I didn't commit?

09:14.095 --> 09:15.347
- You killed an unarmed man

09:15.388 --> 09:17.557
in front of 75 people
at your own wedding.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.059
- Unarmed?

09:19.100 --> 09:22.103
He shot a rocket-propelled RPG
at our wedding pagoda!

09:22.145 --> 09:23.271
- You could've just
arrested him.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.939
Instead you threw him
off a cliff,

09:24.981 --> 09:25.982
riddled him with bullets,

09:26.024 --> 09:27.525
and urinated on his corpse.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.653
- Cunth deserved everything
he got, and you know that.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.030
- Well, the jury
felt differently.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.948
- Well, fuck the fucking jury.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.950
- Look, Mac,
I understand you're angry,

09:35.992 --> 09:37.869
but we're offering you
a way out here.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.829
And this one comes
all the way from the top.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.623
[somber music]

09:41.664 --> 09:44.125
- The President?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.002
Oh, my God.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.506
I-I've been waiting
for this day for ten years.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.257
Oh, my God, I'm a free man.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.176
- There's a catch.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.763
It's a suicide mission, Mac.

09:56.805 --> 10:00.308
* *

10:00.350 --> 10:01.476
Major, give us a second.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.645
- Sir.

10:03.687 --> 10:07.315
[door creaks open and closes]

10:07.357 --> 10:10.151
- In exactly 46 hours,

10:10.193 --> 10:12.737
there's going to be
a hostage exchange.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.155
- And I'm the hostage.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.491
- The kidnappers
requested you specifically.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.159
- Flattering.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.162
- They left this as
some kind of calling card.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.748
Said it would explain
your death sentence.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.709
[snarling]

10:25.750 --> 10:28.545
[mysterious music]

10:28.586 --> 10:29.796
Look familiar?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.423
[gunfire]

10:31.464 --> 10:33.675
- [shouting]

10:33.717 --> 10:35.343
Never seen it before.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.679
- Shame, 'cause this is
all we've got.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.140
- Well, sucks to be you.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.183
Look, super tempting offer,

10:42.225 --> 10:43.518
but it's a hard pass.
[flings coin]

10:43.560 --> 10:46.688
- Mac, it's not for me.
It's for your country.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.940
- Oh, for my country, huh?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.860
Let me tell you a little
something about my country.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.154
I risked my life
for my country.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.740
I saved her from
a fuckin' nuclear holocaust.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.867
And what did my country
do for me?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.201
Destroyed my marriage,

11:00.243 --> 11:02.370
took a dump
in my reputation's mouth,

11:02.412 --> 11:04.706
and caged me
like a wild animal.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.751
So fuck my country!

12:54.691 --> 12:55.984
- This way, MacGruber.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.444
- You wish.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.237
- Sir, we have
strict instructions

12:59.279 --> 13:01.489
to take you straight
to NSA headquarters.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.532
- Well, I'm sure you do.

13:02.574 --> 13:06.161
- I'm afraid
this isn't a request.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.503
- Look...

13:15.545 --> 13:17.756
I have one day left
on this Earth.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.924
One fucking day.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.844
Please let me
go say my goodbyes.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.180
- Sorry.
My hands are tied.

- Damn it.
Call it in.

13:48.620 --> 13:53.124

13:53.166 --> 13:54.959
- Threat assessment.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.962
Awareness, detection, response.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.130
Always be on the lookout,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.007
because if you're not
on your game,

14:01.049 --> 14:03.176
that's you in a body bag.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.178
So to recap,

14:05.220 --> 14:06.638
U-turns are okay
at an intersection

14:06.680 --> 14:09.224
unless a sign
explicitly prohibits it.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.771
Any other questions on U-turns?

14:14.813 --> 14:16.356
- I have a question.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.316
[electric guitar slide]

14:18.358 --> 14:20.068
- What the hell
are you doing here?

14:20.110 --> 14:22.362
- What happens if
you've, uh, done something

14:22.404 --> 14:25.281
that you regret
with all your heart?

14:25.323 --> 14:27.826
Something that made one of
your most dependable allies

14:27.867 --> 14:29.661
lose faith in you.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.204
Is it possible to, uh,

14:31.246 --> 14:35.291
U-turn in that situation?

14:35.333 --> 14:37.877
Like, say you murdered someone.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.587
Someone who deserved it.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.132
And then in court,
you got really scared,

14:42.173 --> 14:44.384
like shit your pants scared.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.219
So you pinned some of
the blame on your friend--

14:46.261 --> 14:48.722
who did throw you
the murder weapon, by the way.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.975
But then that friend got kicked
out of the military,

14:52.017 --> 14:53.476
was forced
to teach traffic school

14:53.518 --> 14:55.186
to a bunch of fuckin' losers

14:55.228 --> 14:56.730
'cause his life
went down the toilet.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.107
Could that friend ever

14:59.149 --> 15:01.234
U-turn his feelings

15:01.276 --> 15:03.069
toward that friend
who fucked his life,

15:03.111 --> 15:05.155
if that friend--
the first friend,

15:05.196 --> 15:07.657
the accused murderer--

15:07.699 --> 15:10.035
was as sorry as
the sorriest person

15:10.076 --> 15:12.787
ever in the history
of the universe?

15:12.829 --> 15:15.582

15:15.623 --> 15:18.376
[whispering]
Hello, Piper.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.379
- Class dismissed.
- No, not dismissed.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.923
Wait, Piper.
Piper, bud!

15:23.965 --> 15:26.468
Look, I blew it,
with a capital B.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.387
- Blew it?
You ruined my life.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.431
You took away everything
I'd been working toward

15:31.473 --> 15:32.724
and threw it in the garbage.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.601
- Yeah, and then I went
to jail, dude.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.685
- So did I!

15:35.727 --> 15:37.270
Five years for aiding
and abetting.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.481
And now, thanks to you,
I'm a convicted felon

15:39.522 --> 15:41.358
and I'll never work
in the military again.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.568
- No.
For sure, you won't.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.237
And I apologize
with my whole heart,

15:46.279 --> 15:47.489
base to tip,

15:47.530 --> 15:50.241
so you have to forgive me.

15:50.283 --> 15:54.204
- No, MacGruber.
I will never ever forgive you.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.873
* *

15:56.915 --> 15:59.793
- Never ever say never ever.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.255
Remember I said
that to you once?

16:04.297 --> 16:07.258
And you said it back to me
a couple days later?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.803
* *

16:09.844 --> 16:11.721
Come here.
[chuckles]

16:11.763 --> 16:13.640

16:49.384 --> 16:55.098

of your heart *

your primitive *

17:06.401 --> 17:08.486

to shake *

17:08.528 --> 17:10.238

- Vicki.
- * Your heart *

17:13.241 --> 17:15.660
* But you left me like a mess *

17:15.702 --> 17:18.246
* Oh, I confess,
I failed the test *

17:18.288 --> 17:20.707
* To bless my quest
to be the best *

17:20.749 --> 17:23.501
* To win your heart
which was a part *

17:23.543 --> 17:26.504
* Of the start of my art
which turned me upside down *

17:26.546 --> 17:29.007
* A frowning clown
all around the town *

17:29.049 --> 17:32.135
* Who wore a crown
and made the sound of *

- What the fuck is this?
- Shh.

17:34.179 --> 17:37.515
- * The bubbles small and tall
and heeded the call *

17:37.557 --> 17:39.684
* And went to the mall
with Lauren Bacall *

17:39.726 --> 17:42.520
* And the late Lou Rawls
and a Cabbage Patch doll *

17:42.562 --> 17:44.647
* And then in the bar,
in the car *

17:44.689 --> 17:46.483
* With a star ate a Larabar *

17:46.524 --> 17:47.859
* With a pirate, arr *

17:47.901 --> 17:50.445
* And I met a robot
whose name was Bobot *

17:50.487 --> 17:53.198
* And we shared a loquat
on a tropical donut *

17:53.239 --> 17:55.575

above the dove *

17:55.617 --> 17:57.994

with Hilary Duff *

took the tuffet *

18:01.122 --> 18:02.374
* From Little Miss Muffet *

18:02.415 --> 18:03.792

to stuff it *

* Oh, what a good time
with a friend of mine *

18:06.169 --> 18:09.005

and it flowed like wine *

Are you sure?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.568
- Outstanding.
- Oh, I was so nervous.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.236
It wasn't too short?
- No.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.446
- Oh, my gosh,
I was so nervous.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.490
[sighs]
- You were great.

19:17.532 --> 19:24.664

Oh, right there.
Oh, that's amazing.

Oh, my king!

disturbing anything.

Where the hell
have you been, MacGruber?

Half of D.C.
is looking for you right now.

how things work.

Remember protocol?
Chain of command?

20:23.431 --> 20:26.976
God damn it, we expected you
at Langley this afternoon!

20:27.018 --> 20:29.312
- And I expected me
to be married forever.

20:29.354 --> 20:32.107
But my first wife got blown up
at the goddamn altar

20:32.148 --> 20:34.359
and my second wife
left me to rot in prison

20:34.401 --> 20:35.985
and is currently fucking
some shit-dick

20:36.027 --> 20:38.363
who can barely get her off
in the sack three times.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.281
So, sorry to break it
to you, General,

20:40.323 --> 20:44.035
but things don't always go
as planned, do they?

20:44.077 --> 20:46.371
Do they?

20:46.413 --> 20:49.874
[somber music]

20:49.916 --> 20:52.419
- It must've been hard to see.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.004
- And hear

20:54.045 --> 20:56.006
and smell.

20:56.047 --> 20:59.718
- Look, Mac, you were given
a life sentence.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.386
Victoria had to move on.

you're going?

21:08.643 --> 21:10.020
- Don't worry.
I'll be there.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.855
- Mac, my ass
is on the line here--

21:11.896 --> 21:14.607
- And my life is on the line!

I'll be there.

And, look,

21:25.952 --> 21:29.581
I don't mind that you put
your penis in Vicki's vagina,

21:29.622 --> 21:34.377
but put it in her heart too.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.004
- You got it, Mac.

- Enough to know
that this might be

21:52.937 --> 21:54.814
my last chance to say goodbye.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.859
- Well, my country
has invited me to die for it,

21:57.901 --> 22:00.612
and I RSVP'd, "Yas queen."

- Uncle Sam told you to jump

22:02.072 --> 22:04.282
and you go get
your jumping shoes.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.910
- Classic MacGruber.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.495
- You don't have to do this.

22:08.536 --> 22:11.039
- And what else do I have
to live for, huh?

22:11.081 --> 22:13.458
A fucking concrete cell?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.877
* *

22:15.919 --> 22:19.130
Anyway, I just wanted
to see you one last time

22:24.386 --> 22:27.847
Look, Vic...

22:27.889 --> 22:29.766
I made some mistakes.

22:29.808 --> 22:30.892
- Are you referring to when
you blamed me

22:30.934 --> 22:32.185
for Cunth's death
at your trial?

22:32.227 --> 22:33.520
- Yes.
- And you tried to persuade

22:33.561 --> 22:34.813
the jury
that it was premeditated

22:34.854 --> 22:36.147
and I planned
the whole thing?

22:36.189 --> 22:37.691
- Uh, uh, yes.
- And then when you

22:37.732 --> 22:39.234
pushed for
the death penalty for me?

22:39.275 --> 22:41.277
- Look, we're getting
in the weeds here.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.947
I'm not proud of what I did.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.865
But if it's any consolation,

22:45.907 --> 22:49.911
I thought about you every
single second I was in jail.

22:49.953 --> 22:53.623
And I understand why you never
came to visit or called.

22:53.665 --> 22:56.584
And I truly accept
your apology.

22:56.626 --> 23:00.005
- I didn't apologize.
- Thanks.

23:00.046 --> 23:04.342
And, look, Barrett,
he's a good man.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.011
And just know, I don't mind

23:06.052 --> 23:09.264
that he puts his penis
in your vagina.

23:09.305 --> 23:13.309
But I hope that he puts it
in your heart too.

23:13.351 --> 23:16.021
I just told him that but I
wanted you to hear it as well.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.231

23:18.273 --> 23:20.692
Good tidings, Vicki.

Nice of you to show up.

- You remember your butt hole,
don't you?

It's right around the corner

relationship with my ex-wife

I gave them my consent.

And I meant that, Barrett.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.158
Look, I'm sorry

I believe you're at the part

to explain

why you don't just let them
finger your butt hole.

Kidding. Continue.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.084
The attack on POTUS

is ex-military.

Eight o'clock a.m.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.266
- That's correct.
- Ante meridiem.

25:58.308 --> 26:01.269
That's, uh, what a.m.
stands for.

26:01.311 --> 26:03.188
- Right.
- I'd always wondered

26:03.229 --> 26:04.314
what it stood for,
and so that's it.

You know, I looked it up.

Yeah.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.707
I know it wasn't
an easy decision.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.167
- You mean the decision

26:24.209 --> 26:27.045
to get killed by terrorists
and be dead forever?

26:27.087 --> 26:29.881
- Yes.

Ain't nothing but a MacG thing.

And I know that every man
or woman in this god damn room

26:41.226 --> 26:43.228
would make the same
god damn decision

26:43.269 --> 26:47.732
that I made 11 times
out of god damn 10.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.443
And yeah, it's brave,
and it's commendable,

26:50.485 --> 26:52.487
and it's patriotic as shit,

26:52.529 --> 26:55.448
but it's also contagious
like the clap.
