<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.935 --> 00:04.860
DUNCAN: You're playing
a dangerous game, Colonel.

00:04.877 --> 00:06.591
Your wife and daughter
will be released

00:06.593 --> 00:09.060
the second our friend on
Pennsylvania Avenue is dead.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.461
What the hell is going on?

00:11.463 --> 00:13.730
I apologize for
the inconvenience, ma'am.

00:13.732 --> 00:17.500
Call Blair right now and tell him
to release my wife and daughter.

00:17.502 --> 00:19.863
He won't do it.
Blair doesn't trust me anymore.

00:19.903 --> 00:21.810
No matter how this surgery
plays out tomorrow,

00:21.850 --> 00:23.680
Blair is a problem for both of us.

00:23.742 --> 00:27.477
- He is not an easy man to kill.
- That's why you need my help.

00:27.479 --> 00:29.212
I ran a test
on the President's blood.

00:29.214 --> 00:31.981
His bone marrow is the
perfect match for your wife.

00:31.983 --> 00:35.017
She's the President's daughter,
isn't she?

00:35.019 --> 00:36.652
You'll need to kill him.

00:36.654 --> 00:38.588
And then save him.

00:38.590 --> 00:40.423
It's the only way to get
Logan to play ball,

00:40.425 --> 00:42.758
but getting the President's bone
marrow doesn't mean a damn thing

00:42.760 --> 00:44.893
if we can't get it
out of the hospital.

00:44.895 --> 00:48.030
We keep this private.
For now. Just you and me.

00:48.032 --> 00:50.946
- How do I get the blood sample?
- Well, when the surgery is over,

00:50.983 --> 00:53.344
I'll have someone bring you
into the operating room,

00:53.379 --> 00:55.203
and I'll hand it to you.

00:55.205 --> 00:57.372
You remember Dr. Evans,
my personal physician?

00:57.374 --> 01:00.142
I'll be at the President's side
until the surgery's completed.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.610
Happy to have you.

01:03.045 --> 01:04.312
DUNCAN:
We need these guys' help.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.581
They'll create a diversion
on the day of the surgery.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.483
I'm told you have a plan
already in place.

01:08.485 --> 01:12.254
We can take down the President
of the United States.

01:12.256 --> 01:13.404
Tell me more.

01:13.483 --> 01:14.722
Once the President flatlines,

01:14.762 --> 01:16.806
we're going to need five minutes
alone with the body.

01:16.841 --> 01:18.760
We need to create
a crisis inside the hospital,

01:18.762 --> 01:20.327
while you're operating
on the President.

01:20.329 --> 01:22.229
I left a bag.
Inside there's a smoke grenade.

01:22.231 --> 01:25.900
Stick it inside the fire extinguisher case
closest to the operating room.

01:25.902 --> 01:27.334
Hey, Jake!
What's the matter?

01:30.005 --> 01:31.013
Oh, God.

01:31.108 --> 01:33.874
You guys aren't goin' anywhere
until the President's dead.

01:40.365 --> 01:42.679
__

01:47.589 --> 01:48.589
You ready?

01:49.571 --> 01:50.672
Yes.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.134
Things will move fast
in that operating room,

01:53.169 --> 01:54.494
so you need to be ready.

01:54.496 --> 01:56.429
I've been through this.
I know what to do.

01:56.431 --> 01:57.530
Right.

01:59.966 --> 02:01.401
After it's over,

02:03.737 --> 02:04.937
what's going to happen?

02:04.939 --> 02:06.205
Follow the plan.

02:06.207 --> 02:08.607
Collect your things,
then leave town.

02:08.609 --> 02:10.508
Eventually you'll meet
up with your family.

02:14.547 --> 02:16.849
But you're certain that Brian
and the kids got away?

02:16.851 --> 02:17.983
Yes.

02:20.687 --> 02:22.821
There's no reason
to keep us hostage.

02:22.823 --> 02:24.423
The mission is over.

02:24.425 --> 02:26.358
Ellen is not gonna
kill the President.

02:28.127 --> 02:29.794
Duncan lied to you.

02:31.931 --> 02:33.465
I don't believe you.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.834
How else do you explain
Jake still being alive?

02:38.638 --> 02:41.339
All I know is there's
something else going on.

02:41.341 --> 02:43.274
Duncan wouldn't change the plan.

02:44.877 --> 02:48.113
If Ellen doesn't kill the President,
it puts us all at risk.

02:48.115 --> 02:49.347
Including Duncan.

02:49.349 --> 02:50.849
Which is why you should take off.

02:50.851 --> 02:52.917
Disappear, before this
whole thing falls apart.

02:54.386 --> 02:55.753
Still not too late.

02:58.022 --> 02:59.457
No.

02:59.459 --> 03:01.459
I'm not walking away
from this payday.

03:02.594 --> 03:04.862
There is no payday.

03:09.067 --> 03:11.101
Better hope you're wrong
about that, Bri.

03:13.706 --> 03:16.268

03:22.680 --> 03:25.115
How will we know
who the inside man is?

03:25.117 --> 03:26.449

Honey, why don't you take that
into the other room to watch.

04:05.756 --> 04:06.789
Okay.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.127
I demand to speak to my husband.

04:12.129 --> 04:14.730
I know he's the one
behind all of this.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.466
You will speak with him.
In fact, that's why I'm here.

04:17.468 --> 04:20.202
How long does he think he can
keep us locked up this way?

04:20.204 --> 04:22.370
Not much longer.
I assure you.

04:22.372 --> 04:24.005
If he delivers on his promise,
you and your daughter

04:24.007 --> 04:26.708
will be free to leave
by the end of the day.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.109
What promise?

04:28.111 --> 04:30.678
That's not your concern,
Mrs. Carlyle.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.981
All you need to do right now
is get on the phone with him,

04:32.983 --> 04:34.415
and let him know you're all right.

04:40.055 --> 04:41.456
Hello, Duncan.

04:41.458 --> 04:42.824
They're both fine.

04:42.826 --> 04:44.392
You have one minute as agreed.

04:46.094 --> 04:48.596
- Duncan...
- Nina, are you and Sawyer okay?

04:48.598 --> 04:51.065
- Where's Sawyer?
- She's fine. She's in the next room.

04:51.067 --> 04:53.667
What is going on?
Why are these men holding us?

04:53.669 --> 04:55.269
What did you get us involved in?

04:55.271 --> 04:57.838
Everything is going to be all right.
I promise you.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.706
(SCOFFS)
How can you say that?

04:59.708 --> 05:01.541
Nina, I'm so sorry.

05:01.543 --> 05:03.177
I just need you to be strong

05:03.179 --> 05:05.312
a little longer.

05:05.314 --> 05:06.513
All right?

05:08.148 --> 05:09.583
Let me talk to Sawyer.

05:09.585 --> 05:12.986
You can talk to them both after
our business is concluded.

05:12.988 --> 05:15.689
And then you can all
live happily ever after.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.225
You don't really think
that son of a bitch

05:19.227 --> 05:21.661
intends to let them go, do you?

05:21.663 --> 05:23.764
No.

05:23.766 --> 05:25.464
But we're going to convince him.

05:51.758 --> 05:53.759
What time will Blair
arrive at the event?

05:54.961 --> 05:56.395
About an hour or so.

05:58.331 --> 06:00.632
What type of security
will he have around him?

06:00.634 --> 06:03.068
He only has one
personal security officer,

06:03.070 --> 06:05.637
an ex-Special Ops
soldier named Wilson.

06:05.639 --> 06:07.439
You'll need to distract him.

06:07.441 --> 06:08.573
Okay.

06:11.010 --> 06:12.945
I wish we didn't have to do this.

06:12.947 --> 06:15.146
He's holding my wife
and daughter hostage,

06:15.148 --> 06:17.816
you'll excuse me if I don't
show much sympathy for him.

06:20.385 --> 06:22.253
This is personal for you.

06:22.255 --> 06:24.756
Like President Kincaid is for me.

06:24.758 --> 06:26.090
I thought it was political.

06:26.092 --> 06:27.425
For Blair.

06:27.427 --> 06:30.227
I believe the President's
death is a matter of justice.

06:31.263 --> 06:32.529
Don't you agree?

06:35.667 --> 06:36.800
Absolutely.

06:49.013 --> 06:52.349
I'm just concerned about the
proximity to this rib here,

06:52.351 --> 06:54.718
can you pull up another image?

06:54.720 --> 06:57.621
Madam First Lady.
The President just went into pre-op.

06:57.623 --> 07:00.357
Actually I would like
to speak with you.

07:00.359 --> 07:01.458
Alone.

07:10.601 --> 07:13.636
I've done some further
reading, Dr. Sanders.

07:13.638 --> 07:15.638
The genetic marker for
dementia that you claimed

07:15.640 --> 07:17.840
you found in my husband's blood.

07:17.842 --> 07:19.742
One lab in the country
runs the test for that,

07:19.744 --> 07:21.511
and his blood wasn't sent there.

07:21.513 --> 07:24.346
Which means you've been lying.

07:24.348 --> 07:26.482
You have exactly one minute
to explain yourself,

07:26.484 --> 07:29.318

have Secret Service arrest you.

Mr. President, you remember your
anesthesiologist, Dr. Carp.

09:21.707 --> 09:24.309
He's currently administering
a general anesthetic,

09:24.311 --> 09:27.912
so you may feel some drowsiness,
numbness, that's totally normal.

09:27.914 --> 09:31.482
Now I want you to count
backwards from 100 for me.

09:50.269 --> 09:51.368
important.

It's essential that we
speak as soon as possible.

- Why?

11:02.972 --> 11:04.906
and I don't know who
to report it to.

11:04.908 --> 11:07.241
There was a guy
taking video of him.

11:07.243 --> 11:09.243
And I know we're not supposed
to take pictures in here.

11:09.245 --> 11:11.078

as soon as I got close.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.580

you with the Vice-President,

12:36.296 --> 12:39.231

I don't want the job,

I wanted to put forward.

31:44.965 --> 31:46.898
Here's some cash
and a new passport.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.833
You should get out
of the country tonight.

31:49.902 --> 31:52.470
- Burton, I'm not running.
- What?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.342
Give us a minute.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.419
Oh, my God.
You need to see a doctor.

32:10.088 --> 32:11.121
I am.

32:13.925 --> 32:15.159
How bad is it?

32:16.161 --> 32:17.494
You'll survive.

32:21.499 --> 32:23.968
Blair is dead.

32:23.970 --> 32:26.235
I don't think anybody's
going to be looking for you.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.040
So...

32:35.913 --> 32:38.849
- This is it.
- Yeah.

32:40.217 --> 32:41.217
This is it.

32:44.888 --> 32:46.189
We made it.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.225
No, you made it.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.296
That's the difference between us.

32:53.298 --> 32:56.732
You got through this entire thing
without ever losing yourself.

32:59.503 --> 33:01.470
I wish I could say the same.

33:08.176 --> 33:09.343
Goodbye, Ellen.

33:19.822 --> 33:21.422
(INHALES DEEPLY)

33:39.473 --> 33:41.274
(EKG BEEPING)

33:48.516 --> 33:49.917
How're you feeling, Paul?

33:51.185 --> 33:54.787
A little weak,
but happy to be alive.

33:56.057 --> 33:57.357
We'll see about that.

34:02.596 --> 34:04.730
- Nina...
- Don't.

34:04.732 --> 34:06.699
Please, Duncan. Just don't.

34:06.701 --> 34:08.935
(SIGHS)
I'm so sorry. I really...

34:08.937 --> 34:12.605
There is no justification
for what you did.

34:16.076 --> 34:17.342
I understand.

34:20.914 --> 34:24.817
But I'm going back to the hospital
tomorrow with the bone marrow.

34:28.221 --> 34:29.688
I want to live.

34:30.989 --> 34:32.458
(SIGH OF RELIEF)

34:33.826 --> 34:36.527
- Thank you.
- I'm not doing it for you.

34:37.897 --> 34:40.065
I'm not even doing it for me.

34:44.036 --> 34:47.072
I just couldn't face
the idea of telling Sawyer

34:49.241 --> 34:52.077
that you weren't coming home.

34:52.079 --> 34:53.444
I couldn't do it.

34:55.481 --> 34:57.582
She thinks you walk on water.

35:00.018 --> 35:02.587
What am I supposed
to tell her, Duncan?

35:09.495 --> 35:10.794
The truth.

35:25.143 --> 35:26.343
I love you.

35:47.965 --> 35:50.967
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetheart.

35:54.237 --> 35:56.039
What happened to your eye?

35:56.041 --> 35:59.842
Oh, it's nothing. Just...
Just got into a little accident.

36:01.378 --> 36:03.046
I want to tell you something.

36:06.650 --> 36:10.152
- Daddy has to go away.
- For how long?

36:12.989 --> 36:15.558
It might be a while.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.594
But what about my birthday?

36:18.596 --> 36:20.329
You have to be back
for my birthday.

36:20.331 --> 36:23.832
Hey. I already got you a present.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.300
It's Mommy coming back.

36:27.203 --> 36:28.904
Thank you, Daddy.

36:30.006 --> 36:31.106
I love you.

36:33.042 --> 36:34.375
I love you, too.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.348
More than anything.

36:43.452 --> 36:46.321
Dr. Sanders told me what happened
with you and Kate Renner.

36:47.923 --> 36:49.591
Kate Renner?

36:49.593 --> 36:53.094
How could she know about...
It was decades ago.

36:53.096 --> 36:54.395
Burton Delaney.

36:56.765 --> 37:01.401
- Mary, you couldn't possibly believe...
- Oh, but I do.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.138
Suddenly, it's all clear to me.

37:05.373 --> 37:07.307
Your cheating, your ambition...

37:08.509 --> 37:11.278
I thought you had limits,
but I was wrong.

37:17.418 --> 37:19.152
You had Peter killed, didn't you?

37:22.724 --> 37:24.224
My own brother.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.761
Who put that idea in your head?

37:33.300 --> 37:34.533
I did.

37:35.669 --> 37:38.972
I've defended you for too long.

37:38.974 --> 37:40.506
But not anymore.

37:41.742 --> 37:44.244
You're going to have to
pay for your crimes, Paul.

37:55.555 --> 37:57.890
(CAR ALARM DEACTIVATING)
KRAMER: Hey.

37:57.892 --> 37:59.158
You going somewhere?

38:00.226 --> 38:02.161
What are you doing here?

38:05.431 --> 38:07.666
Could I catch a ride?

38:07.668 --> 38:10.135
(SOFT CHUCKLE) You don't even
know where I'm going.

38:13.639 --> 38:14.673
Where are you going?

38:16.242 --> 38:18.443
I'm going to see my son.

38:18.445 --> 38:20.378
Then I guess I'll keep moving
after that.

38:22.014 --> 38:23.381
Works for me.

38:26.018 --> 38:28.219
You're a good person, Kramer.

38:28.221 --> 38:29.987
A lot better than me.

38:31.190 --> 38:32.890
I'm not sure we belong together.

38:34.426 --> 38:36.527
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

38:37.830 --> 38:41.032
- You're crazy, you know that?
- Yeah.

38:51.743 --> 38:54.378
- We should both go in.
- No.

38:55.413 --> 38:56.913
This is on me.

38:58.216 --> 39:01.552
Besides, I need you
to look after Nina and Sawyer.

39:01.554 --> 39:05.088
- She won't forgive me.
- She will.

39:05.090 --> 39:07.958
In time.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.928
- But even if she doesn't...
- It's still my job to look after them.

39:11.930 --> 39:13.163
I know.

39:41.258 --> 39:42.424
(DOOR OPENING)

39:45.128 --> 39:48.264
What are you doing back here?
I thought you were gone.

39:48.266 --> 39:50.232
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

39:50.234 --> 39:53.903
Archer left us at a warehouse and we
hitched a ride to the nearest bus station.

39:53.905 --> 39:56.238
Oh!

39:56.240 --> 39:58.339
We couldn't leave without you.

39:58.341 --> 40:00.141
We wanted to go as a family.

40:07.349 --> 40:08.417
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

40:12.288 --> 40:13.788
I don't expect anything.

40:15.490 --> 40:16.590
Me either.

40:19.028 --> 40:20.761
Sounds like a plan.

40:20.763 --> 40:22.030
(DOG BARKS)

40:22.032 --> 40:23.431
(LAUGHS IN DISBELIEF)

40:58.260 --> 41:02.168
My name is Duncan Carlisle.
I'm here to surrender.
