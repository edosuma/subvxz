<i>Previously on </i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.836 --> 00:06.548
Does this have something to do
with your dad? Oh...

00:06.631 --> 00:08.717
You know, my dad is a real jerk, too.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.051
I have plans, Naomi.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.137
You're her father. She loves you.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.514
Are we okay?
The answer doesn't have to be "yes."

00:14.597 --> 00:18.018
Good, because the answer is "eh."

00:18.935 --> 00:21.271
-Help! We're stuck!
-Just calm down.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.648
I just can't be stuck in here
and I cannot be stuck in here with you.

00:23.732 --> 00:27.652
I acted crazy, and then there was
that rando kiss between us.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.237
-But it's never gonna happen again.
-Whatever you say.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.531
I was wondering if I could pay you
an exorbitant amount of money

00:31.614 --> 00:32.866
to move your wedding date?

00:32.949 --> 00:35.493
-When is it? What's the date?
-It's in two weeks!

00:35.577 --> 00:37.746
[squeals]
The wedding is in two weeks!

00:37.829 --> 00:40.665
Rebecca, two weeks is insane.

[doorbell rings]

01:20.914 --> 01:21.748
Oh.

01:22.832 --> 01:25.251
Hi, Patrick. Okay.
What do you think of this one?

01:25.335 --> 01:28.338
Now, don't worry about the walking
'cause I can always shorten the train

01:28.421 --> 01:30.757
or the length of the aisle.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.968
Um, you know, I think I like
the lacy one from Tuesday better.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.429
Really? The strapless
<i>Gone with the Wind </i>thing? Oh, my God.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.599
I don't know. I wear the same outfit
every single day.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.977
Um, aren't you supposed to go to a fancy
lady store to buy a wedding dress?

01:43.061 --> 01:45.021
Yeah, that's what you normally do,
but this isn't a normal situation.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.731
I'm getting married
in less than two weeks, Patrick.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.983
Oh, right, because a spot opened up
at the Malibu place.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.276
Exactly.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.862
And that's the only reason
that you moved up the wedding?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.948
Because, from what you told me,

01:55.031 --> 01:58.118
it seems like you got locked in
an elevator with your fine boss...

01:58.201 --> 02:03.164
No, no. I never called him fine.
I may have said, "He's fine."

02:03.248 --> 02:06.918
In any case, suddenly, lickety-split
planning the wedding of my dreams.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.837
And I actually tried
to hire a wedding planner,

02:08.920 --> 02:12.590
but you try getting one of those bitches,
and I do mean bitches,

02:12.674 --> 02:14.384
onboard with an 11-day planning window,

02:14.467 --> 02:18.221
they're like, "We can't do that.
There's no time for me. The binders."

02:18.304 --> 02:19.806
Well, maybe you could ask your mom.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.392
I mean, that seems
like the normal thing to do.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.269
[laughs]

02:24.352 --> 02:27.188
Help you with your wedding?
Did you help me with my wedding?

02:27.272 --> 02:29.566
No, you just sat in my uterus
giving me heartburn

02:29.649 --> 02:31.317
and made me look like a big fat pig.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.654
-Hold for injectables.
<i>-But, Mom, you're--</i>

02:34.737 --> 02:36.990
Ow! You call that numbing?

02:37.073 --> 02:39.450
<i>Rebecca, I can't come early.</i>

02:39.534 --> 02:42.704
I'm doing a few little things to my face.
Filling, freezing, lasering.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.290
By the end of this day,
I'm gonna look like an empanada.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.835
It's gonna take me at least a week
to recover, so forget it.

02:48.918 --> 02:49.919
Don't be ridiculous.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.922
<i>I'm not being ridiculous.</i>
<i>I'm trying to be normal.</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:54.966
Normal shmormal. You'll figure it out.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.426
Yeah, she's pretty terrible.

02:58.011 --> 03:02.181
So, after that didn't work, I reached out
to my mother from another mother.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.892
Paula! Ugh.

03:03.975 --> 03:08.354
Oh, look, if it isn't
the ingénue beset by tragedy.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.440
Oh, and if it isn't
the plotting understudy,

03:10.523 --> 03:12.609
just waiting in the wings
with a bag of marbles.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.320
Okay, look, we're busy.
We're studying for finals, so--

03:15.403 --> 03:18.615
Hey, Sunil, stop it.
Hi. Cookie, what's up?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.742
Hey, I was just wondering
if you had any time

03:20.825 --> 03:22.785
to help me with a couple
of wedding things?

03:22.869 --> 03:23.870
Yes, absolutely.

03:23.953 --> 03:27.040
No, no, no. Did you not just
hear me say we have finals?

03:27.123 --> 03:30.293
Paula, you were just telling me how you've
stress-chewed through so many pencils,

03:30.376 --> 03:32.545
you're gonna have to get
adult braces again.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.715
You know what? I'm sorry I came over.
I didn't mean to worry you.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.675
The wedding planning
is actually almost done.

03:37.759 --> 03:41.471
There's a couple of cherry-on-the-sundae,
nutmeg-on-the-latté things to get done,

03:41.554 --> 03:42.805
but finals are more important.

03:43.556 --> 03:48.102
So, I will nutmeg
this wedding latté myself.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.813
So, I'm handling it all myself.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.274
I mean...

03:53.358 --> 03:55.443
[playfully]
Unless you want to help.

03:55.526 --> 04:00.406
Oh, I would,
but I'm the delivery guy, so...

04:00.490 --> 04:04.118
Right, right. Right, of course.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.412
This isn't normal. I shouldn't even
be touching you like that.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.957
-Oh, no, that's cool.
-You know what? I will handle this alone.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.752
And I mean, plenty of dum-dums plan
perfectly good weddings all the time.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.426
Hey, bridey, how's the planning going?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.720
Great, great. Hey, oh!
Let me show you something.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.430
Look at this. Check this out.

04:24.514 --> 04:28.518
I already got 50 "yes" RSVPs,
four high-target "maybes,"

04:28.601 --> 04:31.646
and even the "no's" have
a little colon-end-parenthesis on them.

04:31.729 --> 04:32.897
Um...

04:32.981 --> 04:34.649
-Old-school smiley faces.
-Yeah.

04:34.732 --> 04:38.653
So, this wedding is on.
Isn't that exciting?

04:38.736 --> 04:41.364
Yeah. Um, your dad didn't RSVP
to your wedding?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.866
Oh, no, of course not. No.
He never shows up for anything.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.035
I only invited him
to feel bad about myself.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.079
Yeah, smart. Mm-hmm.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.874
Yeah. So, anyway, people are coming,
the wedding is going on,

04:51.958 --> 04:55.586
and I'm just planning it all myself,
which is, uh, what I am doing now.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.880
Wait. You're planning
the wedding yourself?

04:57.964 --> 04:59.257
Like a DIY wedding?

04:59.340 --> 05:01.467
Do I why wedding? Because I love Josh.

05:01.551 --> 05:05.555
-No. DIY, do-it-yourself?
-DIY wedding. That's--

05:05.638 --> 05:08.850
Yes, yes.
That is what our wedding will be.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.270
DIY Wedding. Oh, look at these.

05:12.353 --> 05:16.858
In fact, our wedding
is going to be a lot like this one.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.737
Dustin and Sasha
from Halifax, Nova Scotia.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.991
-Oh.
-Our wedding is gonna be a lot like...

05:25.074 --> 05:30.788
Uh, almost like-- You know what?
Exactly like their wedding.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.542
-DIY makes it so much easier.
-It's the opposite.

05:34.625 --> 05:39.172
'Cause all I need to do is pick up
some twinkle lights, some burlap sacks,

05:39.255 --> 05:42.592
some mason jars, more mason jars,
a lot of mason jars.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.343
Wow, they have mason jars for everything.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.722
For the candles and cocktails
and succulents and lightning bugs.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.850
This is great 'cause all I need to do
is spend a day at a craft store.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.727
-My wedding's done.
-Well--

05:52.810 --> 05:57.190
I love DIY because it's an easier
yet completely normal way

05:57.273 --> 05:59.275
to do a wedding, right?

06:00.318 --> 06:04.614
Uh-huh, yeah. Are you sure?
'Cause it looks like a lot of work.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.366
Okay, so let's look at their website.
Look at that.

06:07.450 --> 06:12.497
They even have a to-do list.
So open source. Thanks, Dust and Sash.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.209
[sighs]

06:21.172 --> 06:22.590
Valencia?

06:23.674 --> 06:24.801
Rebecca.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.386
What are you doing
with all that craft stuff?

06:27.470 --> 06:28.387
Um...

06:30.014 --> 06:31.766
Wedding stuff, huh?

06:31.849 --> 06:36.896
Yeah. I'm doing this whole
DOA, DUI, DIY thing.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.147
Uh, what are you doing here?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.441
Oh, I make my own candles
so rooms smell like me

06:40.525 --> 06:42.193
even when I'm not in them.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.695
It's basically the only reason
I teach yoga anymore.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.197
So I get to use my candles...

06:46.280 --> 06:47.573
Hey, um...

06:49.158 --> 06:52.161
I know you've probably gotten
all my texts, but...

06:52.245 --> 06:56.707
-I really miss you.
-Don't. I can't. Please.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.797
Dear God, I know you're busy
with everything,

07:02.880 --> 07:04.841
from Afghanistan to the Zika virus,

07:04.924 --> 07:09.387
but if you have time, we could really use
your help with our fast breaks.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.514
Oh, and while I have you,

07:11.597 --> 07:14.058
if you can have Macy's restock
the new Jordan 5, size 10,

07:14.142 --> 07:15.768
that would be awesome.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.186
Amen. Okay, break!

07:17.270 --> 07:19.605
-[kids] Yeah!
-Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

07:19.689 --> 07:21.607
Hustle, hustle! There we go.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.110
Man, those kids love you
after just a couple of weeks.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.486
You're a natural, Chan.

07:25.570 --> 07:29.031
And I mean that with the kids,
not with basketball, obviously.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.366
What? Okay, that's absurd.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.743
Clearly, you didn't see me
dunking on Jimmy earlier.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.913
He's 11. And we lowered the hoop.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.708
Still, it felt so damn good.
I was like, "I'm 5'8!" Bah!

07:38.791 --> 07:39.959
[chuckles]

07:40.042 --> 07:42.211
Dude! Thanks for coming in today, man.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.964
Figured you'd be busy
with, like, wedding planning or...

07:45.047 --> 07:47.884
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.
I mean, Rebecca's handling most of it.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.386
See, one of the reasons we decided
to shorten the engagement

07:50.470 --> 07:54.140
is that she's so good at wedding stuff
and loves it.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.186
Yeah, Josh, just make sure
this wedding is happening <i>with</i> you

07:58.269 --> 08:00.771
and not <i>to</i> you, right?

08:00.855 --> 08:03.274
Like that time you walked around
with curtain bangs for six months

08:03.357 --> 08:06.068
because Valencia thought
she might want to be a hairstylist.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.697
Dude, um, I'm involved with this wedding.
Very involved, okay?

08:09.780 --> 08:13.534
Like, I got a ring, I proposed,
I asked you to officiate,

08:13.618 --> 08:17.330
and obviously, I came up
with the hashtag "bunchofchans."

08:18.372 --> 08:21.375
I mean, that's a good-ass hashtag.
So you got me.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.545
-You are on it.
-[chuckles]

08:33.471 --> 08:37.350
[sensual music playing]

-[music resumes]

08:49.570 --> 08:51.364
I never even wash my hands.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.408
Oh, come on, that's not even a sexy one!

08:54.492 --> 08:55.409
[music stops]

09:00.581 --> 09:03.042
Wow, that looks disgusting!

09:04.168 --> 09:07.672
So I am gonna assume that it's healthy.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.966
It's my restart button.
It cleanses everything out.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.969
I couldn't find any place
in this stupid town to make it correctly,

09:13.052 --> 09:14.262
so I made it myself.

09:14.345 --> 09:18.140
It's got spinach, kale, cauliflower,
Thai mung beans...

09:18.224 --> 09:19.600
Blagh!

09:19.684 --> 09:21.352
Why do you have to cleanse?

09:21.435 --> 09:24.981
I mean, you know, what'd you do?
Gain like, half a pound?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.440
No. Stop looking at my wrists.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.153
I just don't feel normal
when I'm packing some extra ounces.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.280
Anyway, where is Rebecca?

09:32.363 --> 09:35.074
It's almost 11:00 a.m.
and still no sign of her yet again.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.994
Uh, well, no. You remember?
She-She called in sick.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.289
She called in, like, really, totally sick.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.958
-Hm, I don't believe in sick.
-Okay.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.712
If it's not cancer, you come to work.
In fact, most cancers are a half-day.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.798
Wow, okay. So that drink
really cheers you up.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.342
Rebecca epitomizes
the kind of laissez-faire attitude

09:53.426 --> 09:55.469
that I haven't been able
to stamp out around here.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.305
For example, what is that?

09:57.388 --> 10:00.391
Hm? What is this?
This has got dead skin all over it.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.851
Oh, that's mine.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.979
I have psoriasis.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.275
Come on, people!
We need to tighten this ship.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.444
If my father was to walk in this second,

10:11.527 --> 10:15.281
he would put everyone over his knee
and not do anything, to scare you.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.577
We need to focus. Okay?

10:19.660 --> 10:22.163
And you need to start acting
like normal people.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.592
There's powder at the bottom.
[groans]

10:36.052 --> 10:39.305
You need to call your little friend
and tell her to come to work, now.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.643
-[elevator bell dings]
-[sighs]

10:47.355 --> 10:49.190
Ugh! Gross.

10:53.944 --> 10:58.032
-Paula said you wanted to see me?
-I wanted to see you?

10:58.115 --> 10:59.325
[laughs]

10:59.408 --> 11:01.702
No, I wanted you to come in to work

11:01.786 --> 11:05.623
so I could tell you
you need to come in to work.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.501
-I don't want to see you.
-Great. I don't want to see you, either.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.712
-I have a superfast wedding to plan, so--
-Yeah, funny how that happened.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.131
Elevator, kiss... Boom! Rush to the altar.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.301
[scoffs] You think I moved up
my entire wedding just 'cause we kissed?

11:17.385 --> 11:20.638
Don't flatter yourself, okay?
So we're done here? We're done. Great.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.306
You're not getting paid
for this week, then.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.225
Coo-coo-cool!

11:24.975 --> 11:27.978
Okay. Dustin and Sasha.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.106
Your list is a little longer
than I thought.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.358
But you know what?
It's manageable. I can do this.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.069
This was in the tray for you
and there's ten more pages printing.

11:35.152 --> 11:38.072
-Oh, boy.
-Tiny font, double-sided, no margins--

11:38.155 --> 11:39.865
-Who formatted this?
-Maya, go away. Go away.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.968
-Hi, honey!
-Hey.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.845
Whoa.

12:01.512 --> 12:06.517
Okay, so check this out.
I got this $200 label maker today and...

12:07.852 --> 12:08.936
Look at this!

12:09.019 --> 12:13.607
Sparkling water from Joshbecca Mountain.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.069
Okay, so what we're gonna do
is fill that bottle

12:17.153 --> 12:19.655
with homemade bubbly water
that I'm gonna make in that soda maker

12:19.738 --> 12:22.116
that I just bought today, also for $200.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.411
So, this is our wedding.
What do you think?

12:26.579 --> 12:32.293
I think it's great, and I-I-I really
appreciate everything you're doing,

12:32.376 --> 12:35.629
but I have wedding ideas too, you know?

12:35.713 --> 12:37.339
Oh, okay. What are they?

12:37.423 --> 12:40.468
Okay. Like-Like, I want to wear
a forest green tux.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.052
That's my favorite color.

12:42.136 --> 12:47.141
Oh, so... Dustin wore a 1930s high-waisted
vintage tux that had a tear in it

12:47.224 --> 12:50.060
that he patched over with a piece of
gabardine from his father's wedding suit.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.855
I'm sorry. I went online today and got you
a vintage tux with a hole in it that I'm gonna patch over with a swatch
from your father's radiology scrubs.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.068
Then what about my idea
for a Sugar Ray cover band?

12:58.152 --> 12:59.361
-Splenda Ray.
-So funny.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.780
I got your text about that,
but Dust and Sash,

13:01.864 --> 13:04.074
they had a jug band
with a guy playing the spoons,

13:04.158 --> 13:06.785
another guy on the washboard,
and there's just a lady who hums.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.456
And so, I already went on Craigslist today
and posted an ad for a hummer.

13:10.539 --> 13:14.376
Um, I've gotten... a lot of responses.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.713
Wow. Okay, um, so you don't like
any of my ideas.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.381
No, no. That's not it at all.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.926
It's just that we're doing
something very specific.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.177
Look at these pictures with me, okay?

13:23.260 --> 13:26.263
And pick out something you like
and whatever it is, we'll do it.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.932
[sighs]
Well, I...

13:28.015 --> 13:29.225
I do like this.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.478
Oh, I hadn't seen those before.
What are those?

13:32.561 --> 13:35.773
Those are origami cranes. I like those.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.442
I was really into origami
when I was in the fifth grade.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.445
We could make them together.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.782
Origami.

13:44.865 --> 13:45.866
Sounds cool.

13:47.743 --> 13:51.956
-Great! Let's look for a tutorial online.
-Okay.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.627
[suspenseful music playing]

14:05.970 --> 14:08.597
[Nathaniel] <i>The key to good planning</i>
<i>is good organization.</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:13.894
And the key to good organization
is foresight. [clears throat]

14:13.978 --> 14:18.566
Anticipating the needs of the client,
so that-- [groans]

14:19.942 --> 14:23.070
-What's wrong? You okay?
-You're turning an odd color.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.864
[groans]

14:24.947 --> 14:28.367
[stomach gurgling]

14:28.450 --> 14:32.037
[gurgling continues]

14:32.121 --> 14:36.500
That is the sound of my body
defeating fat... is all that is.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.626
Oh.

14:39.503 --> 14:43.591
[passing gas]

14:45.384 --> 14:50.431
So, um... clearly, someone has passed gas.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.934
And we don't need to talk
about who did it.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.270
But if somebody wants to be loyal

14:56.353 --> 14:59.189
and do the right thing
and take responsibility,

14:59.273 --> 15:00.608
then we can all move on.

15:03.986 --> 15:08.032
I did it! I farted in this enclosed room.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.158
-I'm sorry.
-Mm-hmm.

15:09.241 --> 15:14.246
And she might do it again, folks,
so we should all be prepared for that.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.000
[groans, grunts]

15:18.083 --> 15:19.627
[passing gas]

15:21.045 --> 15:21.879
[groans]

15:24.965 --> 15:27.593
[man speaking indistinctly on TV]

15:51.241 --> 15:55.079
Oh, no. I fell asleep.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.415
Yeah, you did. It's okay. I was up
all night and I made 25 cranes.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.501
Three or four of them
might not be usable

16:00.584 --> 16:03.504
due to the blood from my paper cuts.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.382
-Oh, God, Becks, I'm sorry.
-No, no, no.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.676
It's fine. It's fine.
We'll finish it together later.

16:08.759 --> 16:13.931
Um, I gotta go do some other things
on this list. Is that okay? Yeah?

16:15.808 --> 16:16.642
[yawns]

16:33.909 --> 16:36.203
No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

16:37.579 --> 16:40.874
Huh? Yeah. Yes!

16:54.138 --> 16:56.557
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.685
-Hey!
-Hi!

16:59.768 --> 17:03.022
I was on my way to work and I thought
I'd stop by and see how it's all going

17:03.105 --> 17:06.984
and maybe help you... choose a dress.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.403
Yeah! It's going great.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.573
-You have a lot going on.
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.491
Oh, what's this? This is cute.

17:14.575 --> 17:18.078
Oh, no! Don't sit in it! Don't sit in it!
Sorry. Very, very, very bad.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.163
It's not a chair for sitting.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.291
It's just for imagining what
it would be like if you could sit in it.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.835
Okay.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.045
What are you making?

17:26.128 --> 17:28.922
Cake pops.
Yeah, they're Dasha and Sustin's favorite.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.133
Uh, argh! Sorry. Their names are not--

17:31.216 --> 17:34.053
[stammering]
It's Casha and Justin.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.638
No, no, it's not. It's fine.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.974
Okay, I want you to...
I want you to to look at me.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.770
Okay, I want you to zoom out, focus up,
and just really look in my eyes.

17:42.853 --> 17:47.149
-Okay, I'm looking. Yeah.
-Postpone the wedding.

17:47.232 --> 17:51.278
Do it. Do it, I'm begging you.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.362
Uh, no.

17:52.446 --> 17:55.032
[scoffs]
I can't. I already have 85 RSVPs.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.868
So it's too late.
Too late. Too, too, too late.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.454
And also, Paula, why are you trying
to talk me out of getting married?

18:00.537 --> 18:04.124
-What do you have against this wedding?
-Nothing.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.126
That's not what I said.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.961
-I'm--
-I know.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.548
Look, I know it seems like this is a lot,
but, really, I'm in an okay place.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.175
-I almost have a dress picked out.
-Ooh!

18:13.258 --> 18:16.178
I was gonna wear the dress Sasha wore,
but she wore her mother's dress,

18:16.261 --> 18:18.597
which is not an option for me
'cause my mother burned her wedding dress.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.349
She was five months pregnant
when she got married,

18:20.432 --> 18:23.268
and so she decided to get rid
of all of her disgusting fat clothes.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.730
Look, these-these cake pops here,
they look really complicated.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.941
Oh, but one's a lady and one's a man.

18:29.024 --> 18:33.195
It's adorable, but how about,
you know, just forget these?

18:33.278 --> 18:34.822
Okay? And-- Ooh!

18:34.905 --> 18:37.783
I can go to Costco!
I can order you a sheet cake!

18:37.866 --> 18:40.577
Oh, God, everybody loves
a Costco sheet cake.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.458
That's so great.
Oh, my God, that's such a great idea!

18:46.542 --> 18:49.628
Oh, that's so much easier than the--
Oh, God. What am I even--

18:49.711 --> 18:51.922
-What am I even doing with this stuff?
-I'll take care of it.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.006
-Okay.
-Yay!

18:53.090 --> 18:55.676
-Oh, thank you, matron of honor.
-Matron of honor in the house!

18:55.759 --> 18:56.802
-Killin' it.
-Yeah.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.429
-Thank you. You're a lifesaver.
-Okay, I love you, bye.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.391
Bye! Yeah, okay.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.184
Yeah, these cake pops
are gonna be amazing.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.021
-Best wedding ever.
-[elevator bell dings]

19:12.860 --> 19:14.361
[exhales deeply, sniffles]

19:26.748 --> 19:28.542
-[groans]
-Oh!

19:34.548 --> 19:36.341
[knocking on door]

19:44.183 --> 19:47.728
Are you supposed to wash kale
before you put it in a smoothie?

19:47.811 --> 19:49.438
I'm just asking for a friend.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.857
-Nathaniel?
-Hm?

19:51.940 --> 19:55.194
You have to go home. You're sick.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.739
No, I'm not sick! I'm not sick.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.033
[clears throat]
I don't believe in sick.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.367
It's like my dad always said.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.703
"If you're not missing a leg,
you walk it off.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.788
And if you are missing a leg,
you limp it off.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.248
And if you're missing two legs,

20:08.332 --> 20:10.209
thank you for your service,
here's a quarter."

20:10.292 --> 20:13.837
It is so weird. We have nothing in common
and yet, we have the same father.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.592
Seriously, you guys need
to leave the office right now.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.344
-I really think--
-No!

20:20.427 --> 20:22.262
-[passing gas]
-No, no, no!

20:22.346 --> 20:27.184
[grunting]
No, no! No, no, no!

20:30.896 --> 20:32.356
What just...?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.777
[gasps]
Oh, no.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.362
Mm-hmm.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.742
-Is it-- Is it still happening right now?
-Mm-hmm.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.244
Oh.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.915
-And still?
-Yeah, yeah.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.127
[grunts]

20:55.254 --> 20:56.546
All right.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.134
You did it. So, when it's all over...

21:01.218 --> 21:04.930
He didn't do anything. It was me!
I pooped my pants in this enclosed office!

21:05.931 --> 21:08.892
Let me roll you to the bathroom.
Let me help you.

21:08.976 --> 21:14.523
No! I'm fine.
I don't need help. I got this.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.120
Nothing to see here!

21:28.203 --> 21:32.249
Everyone, go back to work!
There's nothing to see here, okay?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.267
[door closes]

21:55.856 --> 21:56.982
Oh, hey, Sara.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.693
I was hoping no one would notice me
sitting here alone.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.863
Really? You just waved me over here.

22:02.946 --> 22:06.241
-You okay?
-Yeah, just, uh...

22:06.325 --> 22:08.410
You know, just a little bummed.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.829
I had a bunch of ideas for the wedding,

22:10.912 --> 22:14.041
and she didn't like most of them.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.500
I don't know. I'm starting to feel like

22:15.584 --> 22:17.836
I'll be showing up
at someone else's wedding.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.881
Well, Josh, what do you really want?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.051
You want to see?

22:25.343 --> 22:26.303
[inhales deeply]

22:28.430 --> 22:30.390
-Josh, that is awesome.
-Yeah, but she said--

22:30.474 --> 22:32.017
No, you gotta go for it.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.853
Otherwise, you'll always feel
like it wasn't your wedding.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.189
Yeah, you're right.

22:38.398 --> 22:42.903
Thank you. God, you're so chill.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.121
I gave you that suit
so you could drive home in it.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.999
Darryl, I can't go home.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.376
We have that meeting.
In fact, we need to get going to that.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.254
[groaning]

23:01.338 --> 23:04.508
Okay, you know what? You are not ready
for any kind of meeting, sir.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.552
[Tim]
You look bad and it is not just the suit.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.553
Yeah, you should rest.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.473
Hey, tell you what, we'll get started
without you. Take a nap or something.

23:11.556 --> 23:16.603
-You can join us later.
-[scoffs] A nap? I don't nap. I'm a man.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.438
What?

23:19.481 --> 23:23.735
Napping is manly.
Bears nap for, like, what, months, right?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.445
What could be more manly than a bear?

23:27.114 --> 23:29.449
-A lion?
-Oh, well...

23:29.533 --> 23:33.411
It's like my dad says. "Naps are
for children, the elderly, and weaklings."

23:33.495 --> 23:35.122
Wait, your dad has a saying about naps?

23:36.748 --> 23:40.418
Hey! Your old man isn't here.
You can do whatever you want!

23:40.502 --> 23:41.920
That's right!

23:42.003 --> 23:44.923
Your dad's not here and we are
and we're telling you...

23:45.006 --> 23:47.634
you don't need to take a nap
like a little baby.

23:47.717 --> 23:52.514
You can take a nap like a man.
Take a man nap! Come on!

23:53.515 --> 23:56.560
-Oh, God.
-On the couch.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.103
I guess. All right.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.147
[rock music playing]

24:00.230 --> 24:02.274
-Feet up.

Great. So, Josh,
that tuxedo goes in the garbage,

36:48.581 --> 36:50.833
along with the weird vintage tux
Rebecca ordered.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.544
I scheduled a fitting for you tomorrow,
9:00 a.m. sharp.

36:54.837 --> 36:58.257
Put it down.
From now on, you're on a strict diet.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.718
Don't forget, I know
what gluten does to your face.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.891
Sorry.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.815
Patrick, I am so glad you called me.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.568
I had no idea what was going on
with Rebecca.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.613
But she's not confiding in me at all.

37:20.696 --> 37:24.367
-Both of her parents letting her down?
-Yeah, I thought you'd want to know.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.118
Oh...
[chuckles]

37:26.202 --> 37:28.371
I always want to know.

37:31.999 --> 37:35.461
Hey, Rebecca.
Something came for you from New York.

37:35.544 --> 37:39.840
-Did you order anything?
-No, I didn't.

37:41.550 --> 37:42.677
It's from my mother.

37:43.636 --> 37:44.971
-Really?
-What could it be?

37:49.809 --> 37:50.726
Hm.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.824
This is perfect.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.288
I don't understand. How did this happen?

38:11.831 --> 38:16.002
You useless piece of crap
that calls herself a mother!

38:16.085 --> 38:18.796
Your daughter calls you to beg you
for help and you refuse her?

38:18.879 --> 38:21.966
After a lifetime of treating her
like a dog with scurvy?

38:22.049 --> 38:24.010
No, you shut up, Naomi!

38:25.511 --> 38:29.515
You get your ass to the most expensive
bridal boutique you can find right now!

38:29.598 --> 38:31.684
Pull out your credit card
and get something in a size six

38:31.767 --> 38:33.519
that is beautiful and magical
and will make everyone cry,

38:33.602 --> 38:36.397
you horrendous excuse for a person!

38:36.480 --> 38:39.859
You do it today
and you send it overnight!

38:39.942 --> 38:41.485
[sighs]

38:42.445 --> 38:45.114
Sometimes, moms just come through.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.084
Thank you, Lucia.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.046
That is such a great dress.

39:00.129 --> 39:03.966
-Well done, Naomi. She has good taste.
-Mm-hmm.

39:04.050 --> 39:07.261
It's really disturbing
how normal you look in that dress.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.346
I do?

39:10.181 --> 39:11.390
Thank you!

39:12.767 --> 39:15.311
-[phone dings]
-Ooh. Okay, fitting is now over.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.356
Time for the wedding shower, or we'll
be late for the bachelorette tonight.

39:18.439 --> 39:22.234
Rebecca, I put your outfit on your bed.
Ladies, chop-chop. It's about to begin.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.361
Mm!

39:23.444 --> 39:26.072
Is it gonna be weird for you
to see your never-in-laws?

39:26.155 --> 39:29.909
Heather, I'm a professional.
Also, they kinda treated me like ass.

39:29.992 --> 39:33.996
[gasps] Baby food jars are the new
mason jars! Aren't they the cutest?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.540
The personal succulents,
you can pick up on your way out.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.751
-You're really good at this.
-Yeah, duh.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.379
-Can we get a drink?
-Oh, my! Hi!

39:42.630 --> 39:44.298
Baby food jars, totally trending.
Have one!

39:44.382 --> 39:48.469
Mine's like a Christmas tree.
It has, like, berries and a cute...

39:48.552 --> 39:50.596
-Yeah, should I just keep holding it?
-Yeah, just...

39:50.679 --> 39:52.348
-You're doing great.
-Anyone want another one?

39:52.431 --> 39:55.935
-Cheers to the bride!
-Cheers!

39:57.686 --> 39:59.063
[footsteps approaching]

39:59.605 --> 40:00.606
Rebecca.

40:00.689 --> 40:03.776
That zoning motion you just turned in,
are you serious?

40:03.859 --> 40:06.070
Darryl and I need to see you
in his office ASAP.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.489
-What?
-Come on!

40:09.240 --> 40:12.284
Usually when someone poops their pants,
they gain a little bit of humility.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.536
Heard about that, huh?

40:13.619 --> 40:14.537
[sighs]

40:15.329 --> 40:16.747
Where is the...?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.126
Dad?

40:22.378 --> 40:26.257
-What are you doing here?
-Someone sent a private plane.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.262
It barely gets used.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.225
You're here.

40:37.726 --> 40:39.645
You're really here!

40:53.242 --> 40:55.119
Thank you.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.579
[clears throat]

40:57.538 --> 40:59.206
Why would you do this?

40:59.290 --> 41:02.877
Because I know what it's like
to care about your dad

41:02.960 --> 41:04.587
and what he thinks,

41:04.670 --> 41:06.005
even if you wish you didn't.

41:09.091 --> 41:10.176
Thank you.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.644
Reminds me of <i>Marley and Me.</i>

41:21.729 --> 41:22.730
You're the Labrador...

41:24.690 --> 41:26.942
...and he's the owner.

41:28.652 --> 41:33.574
Okay, just a few more touches
and press "Live." [gasps]

41:33.657 --> 41:36.494
Guys, check this out. I outdid myself.

41:38.871 --> 41:40.164
Oh...

41:40.247 --> 41:43.667
Oh, V, that's... that's just beautiful.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.631
[suspenseful music playing]
