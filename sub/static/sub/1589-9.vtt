00:01.600 --> 00:03.727
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.770 --> 00:07.069
I think that you should
take me home.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.465
You know,
I can't drive right now.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.639
The police have
many theories.

00:10.670 --> 00:11.637
What was that about?

00:11.670 --> 00:13.035
Shana.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.399
She clearly doesn't believe
my story.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.532
She's trying to trip me up.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.808
Did they not make
the offer?

00:16.850 --> 00:17.805
What offer?

00:17.850 --> 00:19.112
Assistant coach.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.242
The team took a vote.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.372
Zack hit on me.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.240
Were you trashed?
No!

00:23.290 --> 00:24.439
If you want to spiral
out of control

00:24.490 --> 00:26.310
and self destruct,
go right ahead.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.089
But I am not going to
let you take my mom down, too.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.553
( neighing )

00:29.590 --> 00:30.659
Oh, my God!

00:30.690 --> 00:32.396
Push it up
against the gate.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.397
( screams )

00:33.430 --> 00:37.719
( thunder rumbling )

00:37.770 --> 00:39.738
I asked Noel
to break into Hanna's house.

00:39.770 --> 00:40.794
Why would you do that?

00:40.840 --> 00:42.501
I_needed someone
like Hanna's mom

00:42.540 --> 00:44.508
to stop questioning
what happened to me.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.539
Why would Noel
help you with this?

00:49.580 --> 00:51.548
What was the plan
if he'd got caught?

00:51.580 --> 00:52.808
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Marin,

00:52.850 --> 00:54.442
I just needed to borrow
a butcher knife?"

00:54.480 --> 00:55.469
You're a little loud.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.283
You're a little crazy.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.254
Spencer,
your eye is getting worse.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.611
Yeah, I see plenty out
of the other one.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.582
Hey, what's going on?
How's your mom?

01:03.630 --> 01:04.722
Freaked.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.193
Guys,
we needed to do this.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.822
You saw Tanner
cornering me at school.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.623
She's trying to poke holes
in our story.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.659
Your story.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.236
( cell phone ringing )

01:16.310 --> 01:17.629
Oh, was that Noel?

01:17.670 --> 01:18.807
Is that who you've been
sneaking out of your house

01:18.840 --> 01:20.171
in the middle of the night
to meet?

01:20.210 --> 01:21.837
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:21.880 --> 01:23.199
You've been spying on me?

01:25.150 --> 01:26.708
Well, maybe
now you'll understand

01:26.750 --> 01:28.638
why I turned to Noel.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.181
At_ least
someone still has my back.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.312
Ali.
What?

01:31.350 --> 01:33.580
I see what's going on here.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.156
One of my best friends
doesn't even show up

01:35.190 --> 01:36.828
to my S.O.S. call
and the other one is...

01:38.590 --> 01:41.798
shadowing me
like I'm the enemy.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.390
Maybe asking Noel to do this
wasn't the perfect plan,

01:44.430 --> 01:47.194
but I'm kind of
running out of choices.

01:51.910 --> 01:53.275
Where are you going?

01:53.310 --> 01:54.470
I'm gonna call my Dad back.

01:54.510 --> 01:55.875
I'd like to do it outside,

01:55.910 --> 01:57.400
but, Spencer,
are you gonna follow me

01:57.450 --> 02:00.169
or have you already
set up a camera for that?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.688
You know, she never
even answered that question

02:08.720 --> 02:09.823
about Noel.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.350
The only thing
I can't figure out

02:11.390 --> 02:12.596
is how did he get time
to break into this place

02:12.630 --> 02:14.188
and lock us
into those stables.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.460
Spencer,
it wasn't Noel's helmet

02:16.500 --> 02:17.762
in those stables.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.358
I mean, we should be
wondering if Melissa--

02:19.400 --> 02:20.833
My sister wasn't the one
who hired Noel Kahn

02:20.870 --> 02:22.428
to terrorize Hanna's mother.

02:22.470 --> 02:23.835
I don't know,
for all we know

02:23.870 --> 02:25.337
she could have asked Noel

02:25.370 --> 02:26.337
to choke her that night
in her living room.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.506
She's clearly gone rogue.

02:27.540 --> 02:28.802
I walked in on that,
Spencen

02:28.840 --> 02:29.807
Okay?
It wasn't Noel.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.670
You're sure?

02:32.980 --> 02:34.811
Hanna. Easy.
You know what?

02:34.850 --> 02:37.648
Last time I checked
this was still my bedroom,

02:37.690 --> 02:40.488
till somebody else got in
and invaded it.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.249
Even the doorknob
smells like her.

02:42.290 --> 02:43.655
( cell phone beeps )

02:43.690 --> 02:45.487
Why were you smelling
the doorknob?

02:45.530 --> 02:47.555
It's my mom.
I've got to go.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.192
Take me with you.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.766
Hanna, you can't stay
at my house.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.939
Seriously, you guys,
I have to get out of here.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.436
Make sure she doesn't drink
and dial.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.755
ALISON: ( recorded voice )
I can't keep doing this.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.826
You have to meet me half-way.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.953
It's too dangerous

03:22.000 --> 03:24.491
and I'm not taking
anymore chances, okay?

03:24.530 --> 03:25.895
It's too dangerous

03:25.930 --> 03:28.694
and I'm not taking
anymore chances, okay?

03:28.740 --> 03:31.903
Shana, please,
don't fight me on this.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.407
( clattering )

03:49.830 --> 03:51.354
( tires screeching )

03:53.900 --> 03:56.368
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

03:56.400 --> 03:58.925
* Swear this one you'll save

03:58.970 --> 04:01.598
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

04:01.640 --> 04:04.006
* Taking this one
to the grave *

04:04.040 --> 04:05.928
* IfI show you then I know

04:05.970 --> 04:09.007
* You won't tell what I said

04:09.040 --> 04:11.508
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

04:11.550 --> 04:14.439
* If one of them is dead

04:17.850 --> 04:19.386
( knocking on door)

04:20.790 --> 04:22.428
Morning.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.018
How'd you sleep?

04:24.060 --> 04:25.755
Who says I'm up?

04:27.700 --> 04:29.861
Is Alison in the shower?

04:29.900 --> 04:31.265
I guess.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.435
So...

04:36.810 --> 04:38.937
I was thinking you girls
should meet me at the mall

04:38.970 --> 04:40.301
after school today.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.534
Who's "you girls"?

04:41.580 --> 04:43.309
You and Alison.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.375
I thought it might be nice
to treat ourselves

04:45.410 --> 04:47.674
to something new for Ella
and Zack's party.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.449
I'm not going to that party.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.843
What are you talking about?
Why not?

04:50.890 --> 04:53.381
Because I have a make-up test
on Monday.

04:56.020 --> 04:59.353
Hanna, I think Aria will be
pretty hurt if you don't go.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.322
She'll be fine.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.463
Can't you study for it
over the weekend?

05:02.500 --> 05:03.922
Mom,

05:03.970 --> 05:06.029
I told you she's not gonna care
if I go or not, okay?

05:16.040 --> 05:17.302
Hanna?

05:19.780 --> 05:21.338
This is not the answer.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.984
This is dangerous

05:23.020 --> 05:24.908
and disturbing

05:24.950 --> 05:26.611
and you know
it's totally unacceptable.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.457
Mom, I know.
Okay?

05:28.490 --> 05:29.787
You don't have
to do all of this.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.388
Okay, listen to me.

05:31.430 --> 05:32.454
I get it now.
All right?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.853
I know _
what you and AlIson

05:33.900 --> 05:35.094
and your friends
have been going through.

05:35.130 --> 05:37.462
I was here in my own house

05:37.500 --> 05:39.092
and I was terrified.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.564
I know you're looking
for an escape.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.569
And honestly,
I don't blame you.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.408
But you can't afford
to not be in control,

05:47.440 --> 05:49.840
especially not now,
when Alison's kidnapper

05:49.880 --> 05:51.108
is still out there.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.777
But they'll catch him.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.969
I promise you.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.749
ALISON: Han,
where's your moisturizer?

05:57.420 --> 05:59.115
Just use mine, Alison.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.094
So when did you
first meet Mr. Fitz?

06:09.160 --> 06:12.561
Um, ﬁrst day of class,
junior year.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.467
Your principal stated that,
to his knowledge,

06:15.500 --> 06:18.628
you engaged in an intimate
relationship with Mr. Fitz

06:18.670 --> 06:20.809
after he was no longer a teacher
at the school.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.570
I'm sorry, what does
any of this have to do

06:23.610 --> 06:26.101
with the incident
at the Marin house last night?

06:26.150 --> 06:29.176
We have several open cases
right now.

06:29.220 --> 06:32.553
And it's helpful
to explore possible connections.

06:32.590 --> 06:35.150
What's the possible
connection here?

06:35.190 --> 06:36.726
I can't say.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.523
You can't say
or you don't know?

06:38.560 --> 06:41.028
Mrs. Montgomery,
if you would prefer

06:41.060 --> 06:44.029
to conclude this interview,
that is your right to do so.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.094
I will ask a judge if he--

06:45.130 --> 06:47.496
No, no, that's okay.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.962
Let's just get it
over with.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.878
Were you aware of Mr. Fitz
seeing other students socially?

06:53.910 --> 06:56.879
Students like Shana Fring?

06:56.910 --> 06:58.605
What are you saying?

06:58.650 --> 07:00.015
Is it possible

07:00.050 --> 07:02.917
that Mr. Fitz had
intimate relations

07:02.950 --> 07:04.087
with other students?

07:04.120 --> 07:06.042
How would sNhe know that?
o.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.786
Do you ever recall
seeing Mr. Fitz

07:08.820 --> 07:09.889
interacting with Shana--

07:09.930 --> 07:11.955
He didn't serial
date students.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.594
He wasn't some creep

07:13.630 --> 07:15.928
that was prowling the school
hallways hitting on girls.

07:15.960 --> 07:19.737
Aria,
they're just questions.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.102
( school bell rings )

07:32.750 --> 07:34.479
Are you next?
What?

07:34.520 --> 07:35.942
Tanner's here again.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.811
She's hoping for a mutiny,
Spencen

07:37.850 --> 07:40.080
If that frizz-top-cop
just gets one of us to cave--

07:40.120 --> 07:41.189
I'm not caving.

07:41.220 --> 07:43.256
Okay,
but what about Aria?

07:43.290 --> 07:45.258
She's totally
icing us out.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.258
Is there something going on
between her and Hanna?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.494
I don't know.

07:48.530 --> 07:49.622
Well, neither does Hanna.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.864
Or at least
that's what she says.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.561
How long are you gonna be
staying there?

07:52.600 --> 07:53.794
Where's your dad?

07:53.840 --> 07:55.569
I played down
what happened last night

07:55.600 --> 07:56.806
so he wouldn't rush back.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.038
What?

07:59.070 --> 08:00.970
It's not like
I feel safe in my bedroom.

08:01.010 --> 08:02.238
I need to go to class.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.747
I've to leave early
to see the eye doctor.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.769
Spencen

08:06.010 --> 08:09.047
If one of us falls,
we all fall.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.149
And "A" wins.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.627
Did you guys come
to school together?

08:21.660 --> 08:22.729
No.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.021
Caleb dropped her off.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.890
She's the one
you should be following.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.608
( cell phone buzzes )

08:32.640 --> 08:34.130
All of our student coaches
must maintain a high level

08:34.180 --> 08:35.738
of academic standing.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.668
Are you taking a language
this semester?

08:37.710 --> 08:38.642
Yes.

08:38.680 --> 08:39.942
I'm in AP Spanish.

08:39.980 --> 08:42.278
Ah, yes, right there.
There it is.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.208
You are apparently
doing very well.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.615
Felici...
TaCIones.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.288
Exactly.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.651
_ You still
working at the Brew?

08:48.690 --> 08:50.885
Yes, but I can scale back
my hours,

08:50.930 --> 08:52.659
I mean, especially
when it comes to meets.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.894
How's the shoulder injury?

08:53.930 --> 08:56.228
I'm much better.

08:56.260 --> 08:58.763
Well, clearly your fellow Sharks
want you back,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.233
in the pool or out.

09:00.270 --> 09:03.899
But the final decision
rests with me.

09:03.940 --> 09:06.067
Are you free for practice
on Tuesday?

09:06.110 --> 09:07.600
Yes.

09:08.780 --> 09:11.544
Then I guess
you have a new job.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.645
Felici--

09:16.690 --> 09:18.646
I can't.
I took German.

09:18.690 --> 09:19.714
Congratulations.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.818
Thanks.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.282
Tuesday.
Don't be late.
Yeah.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.657
Aria, can you slow down
for a second please?

09:57.690 --> 09:58.987
I'm late for class.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.919
I think Mrs. Welch
will understand.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.394
Hey, Aria.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.829
Hey, Mrs. Montgomery.

10:05.870 --> 10:06.859
Hi, Noel.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.765
Aria,
you cannot lose your cool

10:10.810 --> 10:12.107
when you're asked
those questions.

10:12.140 --> 10:14.131
Those weren't questions,
Mom.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.899
Ezra's on her hit list
and she's wrong.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.145
It's her job
to find out as much as possible.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.647
Oh, please, not you, too.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.079
Aria, I know this is hard,

10:22.120 --> 10:24.145
but sometimes
we do have blind spots

10:24.190 --> 10:25.885
when it comes to the people
that we love.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.149
Okay, I really need
to get to class.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.748
I'm already
skipping fifth period

10:31.790 --> 10:32.927
to help you
set up for the party.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.151
You're right.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.394
Thank you.
Bye.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.920
Bye.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.923
(canng)

11:10.100 --> 11:12.830
Has Toby been up here
recently?

11:12.870 --> 11:14.394
No, why?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.067
How about
the Board of Health?

11:16.100 --> 11:18.159
I was gonna straighten up
after I took a shower.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.700
You can sit down...

11:19.740 --> 11:21.037
somewhere.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.707
No, I can't.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.207
I just was stopping by on my way
to the ophthalmologist.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.177
Is there something
growing in that pan?

11:30.520 --> 11:32.317
Hanna tried to make nachos.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.988
Caleb, this can't go on.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.317
It's a frying pan.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.987
I'll just-- I'll buy
Toby's stepmom a new one.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.054
I'm talking about Hanna.

11:38.090 --> 11:40.058
She's a mess.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.159
And she's been that way
ever since you got back.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.225
I think you have me
confused with Alison.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.862
No.
I know the difference.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.788
She's getting wasted
in the middle of the day.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.193
She's not wasted.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.332
She's crashing into people
that she cares about.

11:50.370 --> 11:51.928
Okay.

11:51.970 --> 11:53.779
I understand her not wanting
to toast Zack tonight, but--

11:53.810 --> 11:54.936
Zack?

11:54.980 --> 11:56.231
What does she have
against Zack?

11:58.280 --> 12:01.113
I meant,
Aria, Aria's family.

12:03.450 --> 12:05.338
You don't have to
draw me a map.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.017
Come on, Caleb,
you're not dense.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.187
You know _
what we're up against.

12:09.220 --> 12:10.858
"A" is back
and the cops are circling us

12:10.890 --> 12:12.426
with a million questions.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.428
Hanna cannot be stumbling
around the halls of school

12:14.460 --> 12:16.860
looking like she's on a bender
in Cancun.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.868
Hey, what's wrong
with Cancun?

12:18.900 --> 12:20.197
_ Don't knock it
until you've been there.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.969
She's making
some scary mistakes.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.433
She's a big girl.

12:23.470 --> 12:25.358
Yeah.
She's also a loose cannon.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.298
And you're supplying her
with gunpowder.

12:27.340 --> 12:28.432
What?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.368
She's not drinking alone,
Caleb.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.247
Look, I don't know
what happened to you

12:35.280 --> 12:36.247
when you were away.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.508
That's right.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.347
You don't know
the first thing about it.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.358
Okay.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.028
And it's none of my business

12:46.060 --> 12:48.199
and maybe
I'm not one to judge,

12:48.230 --> 12:50.266
but the thing is that
I've always thought

12:50.300 --> 12:53.394
that you were the best thing
that ever happened to Hanna.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.499
And it really hurts
to watch you guys fight

12:55.540 --> 12:58.805
whatever is eating at you
like this.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.435
But you guys used to
draw strength from each other

13:02.480 --> 13:04.141
and now it's...

13:06.980 --> 13:08.049
I don't get this.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.288
I got to take a shower.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.837
( school bell rings )

13:30.970 --> 13:32.506
So what's next for you?

13:32.540 --> 13:33.507
Bio.

13:33.540 --> 13:34.871
Luclq.

13:34.910 --> 13:36.036
They make me
take earth science

13:36.080 --> 13:37.047
with a bunch of
ninth graders.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.809
It's really humiliating.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.075
Uh, wait.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.519
I'll walk you.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.086
I don't need an escort.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.441
Han, I'm sorry
about what happened last night.

13:46.490 --> 13:47.457
Okay?
I'll pay for the window.

13:47.490 --> 13:49.048
It's not about the window.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.581
Your stupid stunts
affect a lot of people.

13:51.630 --> 13:54.121
Are we talking
about your mom?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.891
Or are you and Aria
fighting about me?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.336
I can help you.
I can talk to her--

14:00.370 --> 14:02.361
I don't want you
doing anything at all.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.198
I just want to be
left alone.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.504
And I think it's best
if you just stay

14:07.540 --> 14:08.507
with one of the other girls.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.609
Han...

14:13.450 --> 14:15.577
What's happening to us?

14:15.620 --> 14:17.247
Our group is falling apart.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.509
( stick tapping )

14:26.460 --> 14:27.893
Hey, Jenna.

14:28.930 --> 14:30.898
It's Alison.

14:30.930 --> 14:34.491
I didn't know that you had
enrolled here in Rosewood.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.599
I came back
a few weeks ago.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.959
Nobody seemed to notice.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.069
But then again,

14:40.110 --> 14:42.135
I didn't come back
from the dead.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.441
I'm sorry about Shana.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.141
She meant a lot to me, too.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.446
Thanks.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.685
And I'm sorry for you.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.280
I heard about
the break-in last night.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.118
It must be hard
to come back here

14:58.160 --> 15:01.027
knowing someone's
still after you.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.228
Wait.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.189
How did you do it?

15:10.640 --> 15:11.607
What?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.699
Shana.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.709
She was my friend
before she met you.

15:16.740 --> 15:18.605
How did you turn her
against me?

15:18.650 --> 15:21.016
I didn't.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.142
You did.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.021
* Ooh-oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh *

15:31.060 --> 15:35.429
* Out of the darkness,
into the light *

15:35.460 --> 15:40.136
* The sunlight and stars
burning holes in the sky *

15:40.170 --> 15:44.504
* And I always dream
of being the least *

15:44.540 --> 15:49.136
* I soar through the air now
with the greatest of ease *

15:49.180 --> 15:51.341
* Oh-oh

15:51.380 --> 15:53.519
* Ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh...

15:53.550 --> 15:55.677
* Ooh-oh-oh,
oh-oh... *

15:55.720 --> 15:58.280
* Ooh-oh-oh

15:58.320 --> 16:00.311
* Ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh...

16:00.360 --> 16:02.612
* Ooh-oh-oh,
oh-oh... *

16:04.360 --> 16:06.658
You can sit out here and relax
while your pupils dilate.

16:06.690 --> 16:08.453
The doctor will be out here
in about 10 minutes.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.694
Okay.
Thank you.

16:12.070 --> 16:16.336
* Oh, tonight

16:16.370 --> 16:21.137
* These ba_rs
turn to Wind chimes *

16:21.180 --> 16:25.571
* That echo out
of my windpipe *

16:25.610 --> 16:30.286
* As I sing from
such great heights *

16:30.320 --> 16:35.485
* I was a bird in a cage

16:35.520 --> 16:40.253
* I sing for freedom
I sing to escape *

16:40.300 --> 16:44.725
* I sent the bird
over the blaze *

16:44.770 --> 16:49.059
* I watched as I rose
above the flames *

16:49.100 --> 16:51.239
* Oh, oh

16:51.270 --> 16:53.431
* Oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh *

16:53.480 --> 16:58.304
* Oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh... *

16:58.350 --> 17:02.741
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh *

17:02.780 --> 17:05.146
* Oh, oh

17:05.190 --> 17:09.388
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh *

17:09.420 --> 17:11.752
* Oh, oh

17:11.790 --> 17:14.224
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

17:55.300 --> 17:56.494
( cell phone rings )

17:56.540 --> 17:58.167
Emily?

17:58.210 --> 17:59.268
EMILY: ( on phone )
Can I call you right back?

17:59.310 --> 18:00.732
_ No!
I'm in Noel's car.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.102
Emily, Jenna's here,
okay, with another Jenna.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.276
What?

18:05.310 --> 18:06.607
They gave me
these eye drops, okay.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.413
And I thought that
I was hallucinating but I'm not.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.712
Stop.
Listen to me.

18:09.750 --> 18:10.819
I got his keys
out of his locker

18:10.850 --> 18:12.488
and searched his car.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.784
He has pictures of Alison
from when she was dead.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.889
That makes no sense.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.319
Oh, but seeing
two Jennas does?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.588
Define "dead."

18:18.630 --> 18:20.188
The last two years
of her life.

18:20.230 --> 18:21.549
He put them
in the same envelope

18:21.600 --> 18:22.726
as the tape
he was listening to.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.227
Why would
he even have that stuff?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.464
I don't know,

18:25.500 --> 18:26.626
but I need to
drop off his car keys

18:26.670 --> 18:28.160
at the Lost
and Found before he--

18:28.200 --> 18:29.337
Fine, but then I need you
to come right here.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.735
( door closing )
I can't.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.237
Emily, my eyes are not playing
tricks with me, okay?

18:32.270 --> 18:33.498
Something freaky
is happening.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.234
Em?

18:36.280 --> 18:37.349
Hello?

18:37.380 --> 18:39.507
Emily?

18:42.650 --> 18:45.483
Sorry, I thought I just saw
Noel coming out the door.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.885
False alarm.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.115
Spencer, you there?

18:50.230 --> 18:51.424
Spencer?

19:04.470 --> 19:07.132
So you think somebody helped
Jenna mess with that eye chart?

19:08.680 --> 19:09.908
Hey, Em, I've got to go.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.248
But we can talk about this
at the party.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.339
Well, not at the party,
butsoon.

19:13.380 --> 19:14.642
Hey.
Hey there.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.648
Were you able
to get more candles?

19:16.680 --> 19:19.786
I did, but they only had
scented ones.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.219
Hmm.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.488
How do_ we feel _
about smelling patchouli

19:22.520 --> 19:23.680
while eating steak?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.482
Yeah, I think
we lose the candles.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.589
This crowd looks better
in the dark aanay.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.552
Shoot
I got to go.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.760
I'm gonna miss
my hair appointment.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.927
Oh.
Well, we've got this covered.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.437
Okay.
Perfect.

19:34.470 --> 19:35.562
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

19:37.570 --> 19:38.605
Bye.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.369
Bye.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.537
Can I squeeze these
in there?

19:42.580 --> 19:43.547
Yeah, sure.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.604
Okay.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.744
What are you doing?

19:49.780 --> 19:52.578
I am updating the list.

19:52.620 --> 19:53.757
Hanna can't make it.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.282
Oh, no?
Why not?

19:57.490 --> 19:59.685
Uh, she said that
she wasn't feeling well.

19:59.730 --> 20:01.698
What's wrong with her?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.197
I don't know.
That's all she told me.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.519
Hey.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.710
Oh, there you are
finally.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.445
Which room was it in?
The chart?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.685
( whispers )
Shh. They're in there.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.687
Who's in there?

20:26.720 --> 20:27.914
Jenna.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.484
And Jenna.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.522
Do you want to see
what I found in Noel's car?

20:31.560 --> 20:33.289
No, I can't even see
my feet right now.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.359
There.

20:38.930 --> 20:39.919
Sydney?

20:42.340 --> 20:44.865
Oh, hi, Emily.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.865
Spencen

20:45.910 --> 20:46.865
What are you doing here?

20:46.910 --> 20:48.502
She was my ride.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.507
Is that a problem?

20:49.540 --> 20:50.871
Yeah, kind of.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.343
Unless you're driving
a taxi.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.517
When did you two
become friends?

20:53.550 --> 20:54.744
We should go--

20:54.780 --> 20:55.917
Sydney,
Emily asked you a question.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.043
Itsounded _
more like an accusation.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.615
Maybe it never came up.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.855
Maybe you should
let her speak for herself.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.323
Excuse me?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.691
When you ask the organ grinder
a question,

21:07.730 --> 21:08.992
you don't really want to hear
from the monkey.

21:09.030 --> 21:09.997
Can we please leave?

21:10.030 --> 21:10.997
Wait--

21:11.030 --> 21:12.588
For more insults?

21:12.630 --> 21:13.995
How long is it gonna
take for you to both

21:14.040 --> 21:16.759
realize that you're nervous
around the wrong person?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.028
I'm not Alison.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.308
Come on, Syd.

21:32.490 --> 21:33.787
"Hi, Caleb."
"Hi, Hanna."

21:33.820 --> 21:34.912
"How was your day?"

21:34.960 --> 21:36.757
"My day was fine.
How was yours?"

21:38.460 --> 21:40.394
My day sucked, actually.

21:40.430 --> 21:41.454
What happened?

21:43.800 --> 21:44.869
Could we just watch this?

21:44.900 --> 21:46.367
_ I'm not
in the greatest mood.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.799
Does that mood have
to do with this party

21:47.840 --> 21:49.330
that we're _not
gang to tonight?

21:49.370 --> 21:50.860
I wouldn't go to that party
if you paid me.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.036
And that's because?

21:52.070 --> 21:54.573
Because I'm just
not feeling it.

21:55.710 --> 21:56.938
I have never seen
you turn down

21:56.980 --> 21:58.971
free food
and a chance to dress up.

21:59.010 --> 22:00.511
Last year
for Cinco de Mayo

22:00.550 --> 22:02.609
we drove 10 miles out
of town to a gas station

22:02.650 --> 22:05.517
just for the free burrito
and a mini sombrero.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.450
Why are you acting
so weird about this?

22:07.490 --> 22:09.378
_ What's weird
is g0ing to a party

22:09.420 --> 22:11.081
and listening to toasts
about eternal love

22:11.130 --> 22:13.690
when one in three
marriages end in divorce.

22:13.730 --> 22:16.096
And what, are you placing
your bets on this one?

22:19.800 --> 22:21.836
Hanna, does this
have anything to do

22:21.870 --> 22:23.406
with the guy
that Ella's marrying?

22:28.640 --> 22:30.847
He's just gross.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.098
Okay, can you please be
a little bit more specific?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.009
( sighs )

22:36.050 --> 22:37.119
He's a sleaze.

22:39.820 --> 22:42.516
He gave me his number
and he wants to meet up,

22:42.560 --> 22:44.528
although no one
seems to believe me.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.698
I believe you, okay.

22:51.730 --> 22:52.992
Why didn't you tell me?

22:53.030 --> 22:54.031
It's not a big deal.

22:54.070 --> 22:55.992
Yes, it is.
This dude--

22:56.040 --> 22:57.098
It's embarrassing.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.505
Right, for him.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.974
Then why am I the one who
feels like crawling into a hole

23:05.010 --> 23:06.739
and never _
coming out of it?

23:09.750 --> 23:11.718
Let's just not talk
about this anymore.

23:15.490 --> 23:16.457
( clears throat )

23:16.490 --> 23:17.650
You know what?

23:17.690 --> 23:19.157
Um, there's just not
a lot to eat here.

23:19.190 --> 23:24.662
So I'm gonna stop in Maggiano's
and get you your favorite.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.691
You just--
You stay here

23:26.730 --> 23:28.493
and you watch the chickiest
chick flick that you can find.

23:28.540 --> 23:29.529
All right?

23:37.210 --> 23:38.404
I'll be back soon.

23:45.950 --> 23:47.508
Hey.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.686
I need your approval.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.058
You look amazing.

23:53.090 --> 23:55.058
Really?
The necklace isn't too much?

23:56.600 --> 23:57.897
No, it's perfect.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.522
Okay, thanks.

23:59.570 --> 24:01.060
Now I can relax.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.091
When it comes to fashion,
you are my guru.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.434
Mom...

24:07.840 --> 24:11.207
are you sure that
you want to do this?

24:11.250 --> 24:16.472
I mean,
maybe you should just wait.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.943
Wait for what?

24:18.990 --> 24:21.584
Aria, if you don't want
me to get married...

24:21.620 --> 24:23.884
No, it has nothing to do
with you getting married.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.991
It has-- It has to do
with you marrying Zack.

24:32.130 --> 24:34.234
How well do you
really know him?

24:35.700 --> 24:36.997
Why are you saying that?

24:38.540 --> 24:40.679
Was he inappropriate
with you?

24:43.180 --> 24:44.977
No, not with me.

24:48.580 --> 24:49.877
Maybe he was with Hanna.

24:57.690 --> 25:00.181
Mom?

25:00.230 --> 25:03.859
Why did you go
there right away?

25:03.900 --> 25:08.269
Um, there was an incident
before we came here.

25:10.070 --> 25:11.901
But I guess I just
explained it away

25:11.940 --> 25:14.079
to myself
as pre-wedding jitters.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.005
I'm so sorry, Mom.

25:24.620 --> 25:25.882
Yeah.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.114
Me, too.

25:34.630 --> 25:36.222
Hey, guys, make sure
to keep the chafing dishes

25:36.260 --> 25:37.796
on the side
opposite the seafood.

25:37.830 --> 25:39.889
Okay?

25:39.930 --> 25:41.090
Are you with
the catering crew?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.334
No.
I just walked in.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.735
Oh, sorry, man.

25:43.770 --> 25:45.306
We're closed tonight
for a private event.

25:45.340 --> 25:48.275
I'm not here
for a latte.

25:48.310 --> 25:49.709
I need to talk to you.

25:49.740 --> 25:52.345
Uh, I'm actually
kind of busy right now.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.075
Yeah, it sounds like
you've been busy.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.314
Being
the kind of scumbag

25:55.350 --> 25:56.817
who's begging
to get his ass kicked.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.588
Excuse me?

25:59.620 --> 26:01.815
Do you hit on all of Aria's
friends or is it just Hanna?

26:04.390 --> 26:05.721
So I'm guessing
you're the boyfriend.

26:07.630 --> 26:09.689
I respect you coming here.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.027
Seriously, I do.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.026
But, honestly, this is
just a misunderstanding.

26:13.070 --> 26:14.628
That so?

26:14.670 --> 26:17.161
She clearly took what
I said way too seriously.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.201
I was just joking.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.803
I don't know, man.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.068
She has a pretty
good sense of humor

26:22.110 --> 26:23.270
and she didn't
find you funny at all.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.875
Well, I think your girlfriend's
just embarrassed.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.241
I didn't want to have
to do this, but, uh...

26:40.260 --> 26:43.354
I was only reacting
to the signals I was getting.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.758
This isn't Hanna.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.836
Sorry to break
the bad news,

26:49.870 --> 26:52.998
but your girlfriend slipped
that into my pocket.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.968
Don't worry.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.146
I'm not coming
back for the party.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.651
Only in consequence --

27:18.230 --> 27:19.629
( door opens )

27:24.910 --> 27:26.798
Uh, where's the food?

27:29.180 --> 27:30.670
Caleb,
where have you been?

27:30.710 --> 27:33.304
He's a piece of crap,
but he has a strong jaw.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.409
Caleb, you didn't.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.418
Of course, I did.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.916
Oh, my God.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.882
Hanna, there's a problem.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.249
Yeah, no kidding.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.894
How is that going to explain
that he got a fat lip?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.194
I didn't write this.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.164
I know.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.178
Do you think that "A"
decided to get in the mix?

28:01.210 --> 28:02.700
Saw that Zack
was a dirtbag

28:02.740 --> 28:04.947
and decided
to move things along?

28:04.980 --> 28:06.777
This is why
he got into my car.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.879
Yep.

28:11.450 --> 28:13.418
Couldn't you find
somewhere to hide it?

28:13.450 --> 28:14.485
SPENCER: ( on phone )
And have Noel Kahn

28:14.520 --> 28:15.487
breaking
into my bedroom?

28:15.520 --> 28:16.782
No, thanks.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.720
It's gonna take you forever to
get to the lake house and back.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.057
You _can't miss
this party.

28:20.090 --> 28:21.728
I'll be there.
Just save me a shrimp.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.057
No, seriously.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.727
I mean, Aria's already
on a war path with Hanna.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.192
If it looks like
we're taking sides...

28:26.230 --> 28:27.731
This is bigger than that.

28:27.770 --> 28:29.362
These pictures
decimate Alison's story

28:29.400 --> 28:31.300
and once that falls apart,
we are next.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.069
These have to be
in a safe place.

28:33.110 --> 28:34.134
Fine.
Just hurry.

28:35.980 --> 28:36.969
Got a minute?

28:39.380 --> 28:41.177
Why are you parked
on my street?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.972
I wanted to explain.

28:43.020 --> 28:44.419
Is Jenna hiding
in the trunk?

28:44.450 --> 28:46.941
Please. _
Let me explain.

28:46.990 --> 28:49.049
Why would I ever trust
anything you said again?

28:49.090 --> 28:51.251
I met Jenna
a couple years ago.

28:51.290 --> 28:52.928
I used to volunteer
at the school

28:52.960 --> 28:53.949
for the visually-impaired.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.399
Yeah,
in Philadelphia.

28:55.430 --> 28:58.490
I was there the day
that Alison came to visit Jenna

28:58.530 --> 29:01.090
and I pretty much glued Jenna
back together when Alison left.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.266
That_ was
a long time ago.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.836
She's been through
a lot since then.

29:03.870 --> 29:06.338
So has Jenna.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.509
And when she heard
Alison was alive

29:08.540 --> 29:12.101
and coming home,
she panicked.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.947
She felt totally alone,
so she reached out to me.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.117
And--

29:15.150 --> 29:16.549
What exactly did
she ask you to do?

29:16.580 --> 29:19.481
I mean, besides taking her
to her doctor's appointments?

29:21.890 --> 29:26.122
She just wanted
to feel safe, I guess.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.229
Make sure that Alison--

29:27.260 --> 29:29.023
Okay, forget Alison.

29:29.060 --> 29:32.325
You latched on to me, Sydney,
giving me gifts,

29:32.370 --> 29:34.361
taking over
my weekends with training,

29:34.400 --> 29:36.368
telling me sob-stories
about how you had no one

29:36.400 --> 29:37.958
cheering for you
in the bleachers.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.864
I didn't expect
to like you.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.229
What?

29:41.280 --> 29:45.341
I-- I didn't know you'd
be such a decent person.

29:45.380 --> 29:48.019
I guess I was
expecting you to be...

29:49.150 --> 29:50.469
This is so messed up.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.147
Oh, it's about
to get messier.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.317
I'm taking
that coaching position

29:54.360 --> 29:55.509
just so I can
be in your face,

29:55.560 --> 29:57.585
watching you
as much as I can.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.156
Emily.

29:59.190 --> 30:00.418
I want to see you underwater
long enough for you

30:00.460 --> 30:02.155
to feel that
twinge of panic

30:02.200 --> 30:04.418
when you need air
and you can't get it.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.892
I want you to know

30:05.930 --> 30:07.363
what it feels like
to be sucker-punched.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.158
( gasps )

32:14.200 --> 32:15.599
Surprise.

32:15.630 --> 32:17.450
What the hell
are you doing here?

32:17.500 --> 32:18.694
Give me the key.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.163
Get out of here now.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.065
I swear, Noel,
get the hell out or I'll--

32:22.100 --> 32:23.397
You'll what?

32:23.440 --> 32:25.169
Call the cops?

32:25.210 --> 32:26.700
Sure you want them to see
what you're hiding in here?

32:26.740 --> 32:28.469
Get out of here!

32:28.510 --> 32:29.534
Now!

32:29.580 --> 32:31.309
You break into my car,

32:31.350 --> 32:34.342
steal something from me
and I'm the bad guy?

32:34.380 --> 32:35.347
Nice.

32:35.380 --> 32:36.472
Give me the key.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.545
Why do you even
have that stuff?

32:38.590 --> 32:40.649
And we know that it was you
that broke into Hanna's house.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.612
We know that
you're helping Alison.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.628
You know nothing.

32:44.660 --> 32:46.150
Give me that key!

32:47.730 --> 32:49.618
What are you two
gonna do next, huh?

32:49.660 --> 32:52.390
What are you gonna
do with that stuff?

32:52.430 --> 32:53.727
Talk to me!

32:53.770 --> 32:57.069
Alison doesn't
even know I have it.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.328
And if you tell her I do--

32:58.370 --> 32:59.735
Wait, are you guys
working together or not?

33:02.110 --> 33:03.475
Our friend likes
to throw away people

33:03.510 --> 33:05.307
when_ she's
done usmg them

33:05.350 --> 33:07.648
and I need to be
prepared, okay?

33:09.050 --> 33:11.348
They aren't just
pictures, Spencer.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.449
It's proof that she
was never kidnapped.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.117
You're going
to blackmail her.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.559
It's not blackmail.

33:16.590 --> 33:19.559
It's insurance,
in case she turns on me.

33:19.590 --> 33:21.148
And I need it back.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.089
Where did you even get it,
those pictures, the tape?

33:24.130 --> 33:26.792
Shana sent them
to Jenna.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.288
And Alison asked me to borrow
them from Jenna's bedroom.

33:30.340 --> 33:31.568
So you broke
into that house, too?

33:31.610 --> 33:32.634
VVhen?

33:32.670 --> 33:34.103
Minutes before
it blew up.

33:34.140 --> 33:35.630
Alison keeps
telling me I'm luclq

33:35.680 --> 33:38.342
I got out when
I did, but...

33:38.380 --> 33:39.608
part of me
is starting to wonder

33:39.650 --> 33:41.515
if that explosion
wasn't a coincidence.

33:41.550 --> 33:44.713
What does she
have on you, Noel?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.379
Enough questions.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.559
Just give me
the key, Spencer.

33:50.590 --> 33:51.659
No.

33:51.690 --> 33:53.089
Give it to me!

33:53.130 --> 33:54.392
4:2;

33:57.430 --> 33:59.295
You stupid bitch!

33:59.330 --> 34:01.139
You try that again
and I swear to God,

34:01.170 --> 34:02.364
I will slit
your face open.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.731
That stuff is mine.

34:03.770 --> 34:06.068
You're not the only one
who needs insurance, Noel.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.532
We need it, too.
Okay?

34:07.570 --> 34:09.276
And I promise you,

34:09.310 --> 34:12.199
I will keep it in a much
safer place than this.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.308
Okay?

34:14.580 --> 34:15.569
Now go.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.086
Go!

34:41.340 --> 34:42.329
( knocking on door)

34:46.780 --> 34:47.769
Hey.

34:47.810 --> 34:49.175
Hey.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.812
I heard that
I could find you here.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.283
Can I come in?

35:00.560 --> 35:05.122
Oh, it's--
it's nice.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.626
Could use
a housekeeper.

35:10.570 --> 35:12.765
Aren't you supposed to be
giving a toast right now?

35:18.480 --> 35:19.777
What happened?

35:21.480 --> 35:23.641
Nothing that hasn't
happened before.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.457
Apparently, he's
a big jerk internationally.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.857
Look, I'm not trying
to defend the guy,

35:37.900 --> 35:43.793
but just so you know,
"A" stoked the fire.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.832
It doesn't matter, Hanna.

35:46.870 --> 35:48.269
He took the bait.

35:50.740 --> 35:52.446
Why didn't you
believe me?

35:53.950 --> 35:58.580
It wasn't-- It wasn't so much
that I didn't believe you.

35:58.620 --> 36:01.783
I guess I just wanted
to believe something else more.

36:01.820 --> 36:05.688
That my mom could actually
find someone again...

36:08.500 --> 36:09.592
be happy.

36:12.430 --> 36:13.419
I get that.

36:19.340 --> 36:21.308
Will you forgive me?

36:34.990 --> 36:37.686
So what do you think
really happened?

36:37.720 --> 36:39.654
I don't know.

36:39.690 --> 36:41.726
I mean, don't you
think it's weird

36:41.760 --> 36:43.625
that Aria's mom_ would
just get food p0isoning

36:43.660 --> 36:45.264
right as everyone
is showing up?

36:45.300 --> 36:47.427
Weddings are tricky.

36:47.470 --> 36:48.869
They churn up
a lot of stuff.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.834
Especially
the second time around.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.668
There may be more
to the story.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.439
Totally.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.708
Someone's
not telling the truth.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.378
You like kale?

36:58.410 --> 37:01.004
I'll eat anything as long
as it's not from the Brew.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.779
( cell phone rings )

37:02.820 --> 37:03.878
Oh, that's probably Hanna.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.489
Hello?

37:14.700 --> 37:17.396
Yes, Lieutenant Tanner,
she's here with me.

37:17.430 --> 37:18.419
Why?

37:20.870 --> 37:22.667
Well, no, I...

37:22.700 --> 37:25.635
Her father doesn't get back
until early tomorrow.

37:25.670 --> 37:26.739
What's going on?

37:26.770 --> 37:30.331
But I can bring her.

37:30.380 --> 37:31.506
No, I understand.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.874
We'll be right down.

37:33.910 --> 37:34.979
Thank you.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.485
What's going on,
Mrs. Marin?

37:39.520 --> 37:40.942
What's wrong?

37:40.990 --> 37:44.426
The police,
they caught him.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.954
Caught who?

37:46.990 --> 37:49.493
The person who broke
in here last night.

37:49.530 --> 37:50.622
They're questioning him

37:50.660 --> 37:53.766
and they think
he's ready to talk.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.791
They want you to go
down to the precinct

37:55.840 --> 37:58.900
and answer
some questions.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.033
You won't have
to do this alone.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.276
I'll be with you.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.919
Hi.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.690
Sorry, I thought everyone
would be at the party by now.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.928
Do you need me to...

38:24.970 --> 38:27.894
No, no, come in.
It's your house.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.660
You were nice enough to let us
use it while you were gone.

38:30.700 --> 38:34.477
Um, how was
the conference?

38:34.510 --> 38:35.932
It was fine.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.801
Why aren't you
at the party?

38:38.850 --> 38:40.670
It was canceled.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.416
'Cause, you know,
it seems kind of silly

38:42.450 --> 38:43.849
to have
an engagement party

38:43.880 --> 38:45.609
when you're
no longer engaged.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.780
Do you want
to talk about it?

38:50.820 --> 38:53.459
Not really.

38:53.490 --> 38:55.822
But Aria can fill you
in on everything,

38:55.860 --> 38:58.727
hopefully, after
I've checked into a motel.

39:02.570 --> 39:03.832
I don't know why
I took all this out

39:03.870 --> 39:05.804
because I'm never
going to get it back in.

39:08.070 --> 39:09.674
You'll do it.

39:09.710 --> 39:12.679
You were always
really good at that...

39:12.710 --> 39:14.871
figuring out how to make
a small space work.

39:20.790 --> 39:23.679
You know, sometimes
I still think about

39:23.720 --> 39:26.120
our first
place together.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.390
Remember that dump
on East 6th?

39:31.200 --> 39:32.622
What was the ad?

39:32.670 --> 39:33.625
What did they call it?

39:33.670 --> 39:34.967
It wasn't a studio.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.729
It was something smaller.

39:36.770 --> 39:37.737
A "bachelor".

39:37.770 --> 39:38.737
Yes.

39:38.770 --> 39:40.169
Of course.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.735
As if that explained why
the bathtub was in the kitchen.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.975
Well, I guess they assumed
that bachelors don't bathe,

39:45.010 --> 39:47.547
which is why
they're still bachelors.

39:47.580 --> 39:50.617
I felt so bad that I couldn't
get us something better.

39:50.650 --> 39:53.778
You were already
pregnant with Aria

39:53.820 --> 39:57.517
and yet, you figured out
a way to make it seem big.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.779
The skinny lamp that fit
in the sliver of space

40:00.830 --> 40:03.128
between the window
and the radiator.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.469
Hiding the fact that you
could get yourself a soda

40:05.500 --> 40:07.491
while washing
your hair.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.088
It was all about
a well-placed drape.

40:15.940 --> 40:21.003
Ella, I don't really
know this guy,

40:21.050 --> 40:22.642
but whoever
doesn't realize

40:22.680 --> 40:26.684
that you make this small world
seem so much bigger,

40:28.560 --> 40:30.687
that person
doesn't deserve you.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.114
Is this your first
attempt to see her

41:00.150 --> 41:02.209
after she ran
away from you?

41:03.760 --> 41:06.058
She didn't run away.

41:06.090 --> 41:07.853
She jumped
out of my car.

41:09.060 --> 41:11.096
And you had her
blindfolded.

41:11.130 --> 41:12.961
That's right.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.661
At least when
I was around her.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.134
Are you referring
to the car ride?

41:17.170 --> 41:19.730
No.

41:19.770 --> 41:22.807
Since the day
she came away with me.

41:22.840 --> 41:23.932
After I hit her.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.005
Where did you hit her?

41:26.050 --> 41:29.611
Back of the head.

41:29.650 --> 41:32.289
I followed her
into the yard

41:32.320 --> 41:34.140
and I found a rock
and I hit her.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.288
Then I carried her
to my car.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.026
Where did you take her?

41:42.060 --> 41:44.199
Philly.

41:44.230 --> 41:47.290
A place I was staying
near South Street.

41:47.330 --> 41:49.264
Your home?

41:49.300 --> 41:51.666
I was crashing there,
yeah.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.063
It was a basement.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.000
Nobody else was there.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.746
TANNER: And you
kept her locked up

41:58.780 --> 42:01.943
in the basement
all that time?

42:01.980 --> 42:03.641
Can you turn
the volume down?

42:08.320 --> 42:11.585
Alison, is that him?

42:12.760 --> 42:14.694
Is that the man
who kidnapped you?

42:25.670 --> 42:27.558
The doctor's running
just a little behind.

42:27.610 --> 42:28.770
It shouldn't be
much longer.

42:28.810 --> 42:30.539
You think you can
entertain yourself?

42:34.750 --> 42:37.116
If you're cold,
I can turn down the AC.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.657
ALISON: ( recorded voice)
He followed me into my yard.

42:46.690 --> 42:48.851
And then he hit me
with that rock.

42:48.900 --> 42:52.097
Next thing I knew
I woke up blindfolded.
