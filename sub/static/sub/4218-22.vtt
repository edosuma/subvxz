WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:04.128
We have an
active chemical spill.
Suit up for rescue!

00:04.713 --> 00:06.255
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:06.423 --> 00:09.050
I don't want us
going down the same
road we did last time

00:09.218 --> 00:12.428
and not talking to each other
for a month. You're too
important to me for that.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.555
I feel the same way.
You know, I found
this contract

00:14.723 --> 00:16.516
that we both signed after
we got into an argument.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.185
Let's always keep the fighting
clean and the sex dirty.

00:20.771 --> 00:24.148
I could always just tell that
there was something that
wasn't being told to me.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.734
Do you really not care if it
all comes out?

00:26.902 --> 00:28.945
Pete's going to keep digging
until he finds out.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.906
If you care about Mills like
I think you do, drop it.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.075
Oh, God!
The victim's underneath!

00:34.743 --> 00:36.577
Hang on ma'am,
we're going to get you out.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.830
She said you tried to
kiss her but she was
uncomfortable

00:38.997 --> 00:40.081
and tried to leave.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.375
IAD is pushing me to file a
police report.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.669
For what? Look me in the eye,
tell me what I did!

00:44.837 --> 00:47.046
The I. G has sustained
Tara's allegations.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.757
They're kicking the case up to
the state's attorney's office.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.051
Meaning what?
Criminal charges.

01:02.855 --> 01:03.730
A promotion, huh?

01:05.858 --> 01:06.607
You need to stay away.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.985
You get a promotion and
meanwhile I could go to jail.

01:09.153 --> 01:12.280
Get away.
They're talking about filing
criminal charges!

01:12.906 --> 01:13.573
Why the hell are
you doing this?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.158
I didn't do a damn
thing to you!

01:15.325 --> 01:17.160
I said to stay away!
You okay ma'am?

01:17.327 --> 01:18.578
She's fine.
Ma'am?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.997
We both know nothing
happened that night!
Hey.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.874
Tara!

01:35.304 --> 01:36.387
I have a request.

01:36.555 --> 01:37.638
Yeah? What's that?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.271
That we don't move from this
spot for the entire day.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.775
And you skip your shift?

01:49.651 --> 01:50.902
Mmm...

01:51.069 --> 01:54.113
I'll just have the
truck pick me up here
if we get any calls.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.118
I don't think these boxers
are going to stand up
against a fire.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.621
I'll just call out orders
from this spot.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.790
Cruz, grab a
two and a half.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.209
Mouch, put down the sandwich.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.845
At twenty-four hours and
one minute, I want to be
right back here.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.266
Deal.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.743
I'm happy for them.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.495
Yeah, me too.

02:43.956 --> 02:44.914
Are you?

02:46.208 --> 02:48.334
Without a doubt. Yes.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.546
Good.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.387
So... Um...

03:00.389 --> 03:02.598
This might be a weird time,
but um...

03:03.308 --> 03:07.937
I was just thinking this
whole two rent thing,
it's... It's crazy.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.897
"Two rent thing?"

03:10.607 --> 03:12.817
I mean, you know,
you're basically living
with me already.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.945
And we only call each other to
say, "Hey, are you home yet?"
So...

03:17.865 --> 03:20.575
How about I give you a key,
we make it official,
and you move in?

03:21.910 --> 03:25.788
I realize that was the
complete opposite of being
romantic... Um...

03:25.956 --> 03:27.206
No, no.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.709
Look, I know I'm really,
really bad at this.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.921
I keep beating around the bush
all the time, but...
I love you.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.467
Uhhh...
I think we should
live together.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.139
I'm... I'm...
Oh, God that was awful.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.349
That was really awful.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.853
Yeah, it was.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.900
Look, take the time you
need to think about it,

03:54.359 --> 03:56.193
and let me know.
No pressure.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.865
Hey, Peter Mills. Hurry up,

04:01.033 --> 04:04.160
cause I've got to take
your money after I finish
with Cruz here.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.453
Okay, duty calls.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.418
What up, Sunshine?

04:15.130 --> 04:18.049
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.551
Building collapse,
800 South Carpenter Street.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.097
He loves you!
That's great news! Right?

04:25.599 --> 04:26.641
I don't know.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.478
Out with it.
What?

04:32.439 --> 04:33.856
I, uh...

04:34.024 --> 04:37.026
I still haven't come
clean with him about
Boden and his mom.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.695
And it just, it feels
like this dark cloud
hanging over us.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.406
Over you, you mean.
Well, to be fair, yes.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.575
Okay. So, repeat after me.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.786
"It's not my business."
Shay...

04:46.954 --> 04:49.997
I'm serious. That is between
Boden and what's-her-name.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.916
I just feel guilty is
all I'm saying.

04:52.084 --> 04:56.170
A lie of omission is still
a lie and if we're gonna be
getting this serious...

05:17.150 --> 05:18.901
Chief...

05:19.069 --> 05:22.363
All the schools are on
spring break. Big party, we're
here on a "D and D."

05:22.531 --> 05:25.032
We saw the whole thing
collapse. One porch on
top of another.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.367
Yeah, there's at least
a dozen trapped.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.994
Just tell us where
you need us, Chief.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.704
Get the surface victims first.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.207
Set up cribbing columns...
K-12 and sawzalls to
cut away the timber.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.876
Battalion 25
to Dispatch,

05:36.044 --> 05:39.547
We have a three
story deck collapse,
multiple victims.

05:40.424 --> 05:44.427
Give me an EMS plan
two and two extra truck
companies for manpower.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.264
No! Oh, God! Oh, God!

05:48.432 --> 05:51.851
Ma'am! Ma'am,
stay back, stay back.
Come on.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.186
No! Let me go! Let me go!

05:54.938 --> 05:56.814
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.817
We're going to do
everything in our power
to help your friend.

05:59.985 --> 06:05.156
Paul, his name is Paul, he's
my fiancÃ©. Tell me he isn't...
We were just talking...

06:09.870 --> 06:11.787
Okay, Katie, I need
you to listen to me.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.623
No. No! Please don't say it.
Katie, he's gone.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.417
No!
He's gone.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.544
Katie, You've got to stop.
You've got to stop!
No!

06:18.712 --> 06:19.670
Katie!

06:21.089 --> 06:22.965
You did nothing!

06:23.675 --> 06:25.801
You did nothing!

06:44.529 --> 06:45.529
Ow!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.661
I got one!

06:57.292 --> 06:58.667
I'm going to die!

06:58.835 --> 07:02.213
You're not going to die,
ma'am.
You're not going to die.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.926
She's got an impalement in her
chest and lots of blood...
We've got to get her

07:07.094 --> 07:09.470
free enough to transport her
and this piece of wood.

07:09.638 --> 07:10.679
I can't breathe.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.516
Take slow breaths, okay?
Slow breaths.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.855
Hey! We got one.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.653
We need some more hands!

07:25.821 --> 07:29.365
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna...
Not gonna make it...

07:29.533 --> 07:32.243
What's your name?
Valerie.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.830
Valerie, you're going
to make it. You have
to believe that, okay?

07:36.832 --> 07:38.124
Don't lie to me.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.794
You're not telling
me how bad it is.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.801
Okay, Valerie,
keep still.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.476
All right, clear.
All right, let's get her
on the backboard! Now!

08:08.071 --> 08:09.280
Heart rate's dropping.

08:10.782 --> 08:11.949
She's crashing, Shay!

08:12.117 --> 08:14.493
61 to Lakeshore, we're coming
in hot with a trauma victim.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.705
20 years old,
impalement injury,
respirations are dropping.

08:17.873 --> 08:18.914
Copy that,
Ambulance.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.923
I need a
crash cart! Call for
respiratory and blood.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.800
Let's hang
units of O-negative!

08:29.968 --> 08:31.844
Let's get x-ray and
CT standing by.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.313
Push an epi, now.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.323
Stop compressions.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.871
We've got a pulse!
Let's get her into trauma!
Let's go!

09:01.750 --> 09:02.958
Nice work, Dawson.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.259
Wow.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.392
Could have been a
hell of a lot worse.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.354
Two DOAs and I bet we
saved a dozen or more.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.105
That right there's
what it's all about.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.035
Hey!

09:39.454 --> 09:40.788
What are you doing?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.667
I'm supposed to
speak to Luke's class
about fire safety.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.544
So I'm going to rig one
side of the house

09:47.712 --> 09:52.383
with flammable materials and
then the other side with
flame-resistant type stuff.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.928
Then I'm going to
demonstrate the difference.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.888
Kids are going to love it.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.306
Oh. What could
possibly go wrong?

09:59.474 --> 10:00.808
Guys, guys. I have an
announcement to make.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.309
Please, I need everybody's
attention.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.313
Today, I came across
something so upsetting...

10:06.481 --> 10:08.274
That it literally shook
me to the core.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.234
I was in the
laundry room.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.486
I was putting my stuff from
the washer to the dryer,

10:12.654 --> 10:15.864
and I discovered these,
left inside.

10:17.909 --> 10:21.745
Don't look at me! I've been a
Fruit of the Loom man
since 1975.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.916
Twenty bucks to whoever
finds the owner.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.128
Lieutenant. No!

10:29.296 --> 10:30.671
First, they ain't mine.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.382
Second, these don't come down
until the owner steps forward.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.301
I can't unsee this...

10:35.468 --> 10:36.719
Someone has to pay.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.847
He who smelt it,
hath dealt it.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.809
You're nuts. Those look like
something that a Russian would
wear on his wedding night.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.272
They're not mine!
But, I will put my
money on Capp.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.150
Keep deflecting, Otis.
That's a good strategy.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.319
Whoa!

10:53.903 --> 10:54.903
Whoa!

11:05.707 --> 11:08.625
Maybe I'll just let the
kids wear the oxygen mask.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.216
Excuse me?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.926
Yeah?
Hi.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.553
Uh, I was wondering...

11:19.721 --> 11:23.098
Do you guys allow kids in
here to take a picture on
a truck or something?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.100
Yeah, of course we do.
Where are the kids?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.518
Oh.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.896
Um, I'm just checking...

11:29.564 --> 11:30.647
Some other time.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.108
Okay.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.615
You confronted her?
In a parking lot?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.410
I'm facing criminal charges.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.120
Damn right I confronted her.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.830
You are not helping yourself.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.499
Chief, I did nothing wrong.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.959
You did today.
You strengthened her case.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.127
Whose side are you on?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.089
I am trying to help you here.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.340
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.885
I'll handle this
myself, thanks.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.261
No, no.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.013
You contact her again,

12:03.181 --> 12:06.225
you go within a hundred feet
of her, you will force me to
take away your Squad.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.521
That's your way
of helping?
Yes.

12:25.787 --> 12:26.954
Hey, Chief.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.707
We're taking bets on the
red skivvies from the laundry.
You interested?

12:37.006 --> 12:41.051
My dad used to tell me, "You
have a choice. You can either
choose to be in a bad mood..."

12:41.594 --> 12:43.303
Right.
"Or you can just decide
to be happy."

12:44.055 --> 12:45.305
Where is this going?

12:48.476 --> 12:52.271
Uh, at first I wasn't sure
about Mills, right?

12:52.439 --> 12:55.983
Was he too young,
was I just rebounding,
did we move too fast?

12:56.693 --> 13:00.696
But then I realized,
damn it... He's good to me.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.865
Be happy.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.325
So you love him because
you choose to?

13:06.661 --> 13:09.079
No. Because I do.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.874
Aw...

13:12.041 --> 13:13.667
My little Dawson's
all growed up.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.127
Shut up.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.338
What about the mom thing?

13:21.176 --> 13:22.301
I don't know.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.314
Ambulance 61,
man down and unconscious...

13:35.482 --> 13:36.982
Looks like it's
one of those days.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.713
Hey there, bud. How you doing?

14:02.884 --> 14:05.135
His pulse is fast.
Let's set him down and
check his heart rate.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.221
All right. Oh!
Here we go, buddy.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.847
All right.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.724
Okay.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.312
Vergilio Ventura.

14:15.897 --> 14:16.980
Welcome back, pal.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.566
You had a couple of
cocktails today?

14:19.734 --> 14:21.485
No, I think something
a little heavier.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.611
What's your flavor, Verge?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.321
A little H?

14:25.865 --> 14:26.782
Huh.

14:26.950 --> 14:27.783
He's clean.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.035
What's up with you, buddy?

14:35.583 --> 14:38.168
His heart's racing at 150...
He's in SVT.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.337
We're going to
lose him if we don't
stabilize his rhythm.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.382
Cardioverting at 100.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.508
Stand back.

14:44.676 --> 14:45.717
Dawson, wait!

14:46.219 --> 14:48.136
His ears, look at his ears.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.888
Look.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.854
Shay, he's got
an electrical burn.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.192
His shoe is missing.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.445
It's a third degree burn.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.406
He's got an exit wound.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.666
He was hit by lightning!

15:18.459 --> 15:19.918
We can't shock him.
His heart's had too
much trauma.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.337
Six mils of Adenosine.
Yeah, yeah!

15:27.802 --> 15:29.303
Hang in there, hang in there.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.765
Okay. Ready when you are.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.060
On three... One, two, push!

15:41.941 --> 15:44.860
Okay, okay.
That bought us some time.
Let's get him out of here!

15:49.907 --> 15:51.366
What is it?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.660
Ah, nothing.

15:53.828 --> 15:54.828
Rough shift.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.079
Yeah.

15:59.751 --> 16:00.667
Hey.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.169
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

16:03.046 --> 16:06.423
I'm doing all the cooking
now that Cindy's in
the home stretch so...

16:07.342 --> 16:10.344
It's either going to be pizza
or steak. It's your call.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.388
Well, I could never turn
down a Herrmann steak.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.598
All right!

16:16.017 --> 16:17.100
You bring the beer, all right?

16:17.268 --> 16:18.852
I will. Thanks.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.520
Hey! Excuse me, Chief?

16:20.688 --> 16:21.647
Um...

16:21.814 --> 16:23.690
I was wondering,
could I pick up a
couple of shifts next week?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.025
Maybe pull a 48?

16:25.193 --> 16:27.527
These squad classes are
breaking the bank so...

16:27.695 --> 16:28.737
I just need the extra money.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.739
What'd your Lieutenant say?

16:31.199 --> 16:32.366
To check with you.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.159
I think we can
make that happen.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.661
Yeah?
I'll talk to second watch.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.120
Thank you.
Okay.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.835
I'm not exactly one to sit
on my hands, you know?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.171
Yeah, well, you shouldn't.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.715
Yeah, well, that's not what
the CFD is advising.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.550
I'm running out of
options here, Shay.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.594
I'm telling you, the
more I think about it,

16:52.762 --> 16:54.137
the more I think

16:54.305 --> 16:56.390
that she targeted
you specifically.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.516
She knew your background

16:57.684 --> 17:00.769
and she took what,
all of two seconds to
start flirting up a storm.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.814
Anyone do a
background check on her?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.317
I've... I've been on my heels
this whole time. No.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.694
Yeah, exactly.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.779
It's time to turn it around
and go on the offensive.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.834
You thinking
about jumping?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.335
Hey!
Hey.

17:25.753 --> 17:26.795
You made it.
Yeah.

17:26.963 --> 17:27.963
Bearing carbs.

17:28.756 --> 17:29.756
I see.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.805
What is it?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.684
You haven't answered
my question.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.397
I know that I'm
moving too fast, I...

17:45.565 --> 17:46.815
Peter.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.027
I love you, too.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.072
Really?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.782
Yeah, really.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.621
I've just got one
question for you.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.625
Am I going to have to borrow
Antonio's pick-up or are you
going to help me move?

18:08.504 --> 18:10.255
I will help you move.
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.851
Hey.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.353
Hey, man.
Thanks for meeting me.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.565
You sure you know
what you're doing?

18:28.733 --> 18:31.234
Like I told you on the phone,
I'm feeling out of options.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.945
Well.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.947
It might be worse
than you think.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.992
I called the Assistant
State's Attorney.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.952
That Rutkowski's
testimony landed

18:42.246 --> 18:44.915
and they won't be
accused of playing
favorites for a firefighter.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.835
They're going to approve
criminal charges.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.807
I ran a background
check on Tara Little.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.059
She worked at an ad agency.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.186
There were criminal
charges filed and
then withdrawn.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.854
Against her?
No.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.649
A fellow employee there
named Clay White.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.817
There's an address in there.

19:12.777 --> 19:13.902
I appreciate it.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.406
If I was smart I'd tell
you to let a lawyer
handle it from here.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.256
May I help you?

19:35.299 --> 19:36.383
Are you Clay White?

19:37.552 --> 19:38.552
I am.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.723
I was told to talk to you
about Tara Little?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.727
Anything you want to say
about her, you can tell to
my lawyer.

19:47.895 --> 19:48.979
Now get the hell out.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.606
It's not like that.

19:54.819 --> 19:55.861
I... I need your help.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.616
I was a mid-level executive
at Ramsey-Cole,

20:02.660 --> 20:05.161
a high-end ad agency on
Michigan Avenue.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.916
Tara was one of twenty graphic
designers we had on staff.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.878
Tara and I had hit it off.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.671
Was it inappropriate?

20:14.839 --> 20:16.882
She was game and
I wasn't married.

20:17.049 --> 20:17.883
It was all consensual.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.259
We had some fun but...

20:19.802 --> 20:20.927
Went in different directions.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.554
Ended totally civil.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.306
Then, we lost an account.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.517
The rumor mill started
flying about downsizing.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.061
Next thing I know, Tara
makes a claim.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.024
Says I took
advantage of her, it was a
"hostile work environment."

20:35.192 --> 20:38.945
I was fired and ostracized
by the whole industry.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.159
I've got an MBA.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.329
And this is what I do
to pay my mortgage.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.916
She got a nice settlement
from what I heard.

20:52.919 --> 20:53.960
Sounds familiar.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.714
Would you consider
coming forward?

20:57.882 --> 21:01.843
I signed a nondisclosure
agreement so she'd drop
the criminal charges.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.931
You didn't answer my question.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.777
Let me take a look
at it, Miranda.

21:21.489 --> 21:22.405
Wow. What happened?

21:22.573 --> 21:25.951
I was texting on
my phone and I walked
into a damn tree.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.243
Oh, that's a new one.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.038
All right. I'm going to walk
you back to a bed where we
can get that thumb set.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.539
You can walk with me?
Yeah.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.749
No texting while you do it.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.506
One second.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.424
Thanks.

21:46.681 --> 21:47.681
Hey.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.769
You used to always drop by the
firehouse with lunch. So...

21:53.813 --> 21:55.814
I'm returning the favor.
If you have time.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.192
Gotcha covered.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.611
Come on.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.489
I wanna show
you around.
Okay.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.658
We have five beds.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.493
But we can stuff eight
in here if we need to.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.619
All right.

22:09.787 --> 22:10.954
Um...

22:11.122 --> 22:12.831
A couple of visitation rooms,

22:12.999 --> 22:14.582
a couple of offices.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.792
That's where we keep the meds.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.627
This is our bathroom...

22:17.795 --> 22:20.380
One bathroom, mind you,
for all of us including
the patients.

22:20.548 --> 22:21.631
Hallie.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.009
Oh, Steven Gooding.
He started the clinic.
This is my...

22:24.885 --> 22:26.094
This is Matt.
Hey.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.595
Nice to meet you.

22:27.763 --> 22:28.763
Listen, Hallie, do you think
you could help us out

22:28.931 --> 22:31.307
out on Sunday, maybe,
uh, noon to five-ish?

22:31.475 --> 22:32.475
Doctor Arend can't make it.

22:32.643 --> 22:35.103
Yeah, I think so. I just
have to check my schedule
over at Lakeshore.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.605
Great. Just let me know, okay?
Nice to meet you, Matt.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.107
You too.
One sec.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.201
Huh.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.661
That's weird.
What?

22:52.455 --> 22:53.538
Uh, what?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.417
Oh, yeah. I know about this.
I'll take care of it.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.210
Okay.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.797
Everything good?
Yeah.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.758
I'm starving. Let's go.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.764
You really like it here?

23:12.558 --> 23:16.811
Yes. When I was away I
remembered why I got into
medicine in the first place.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.693
I remembered a lot of things
I wanted to reclaim for
myself when I returned.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.710
I won! Yes!

23:41.629 --> 23:43.338
Turn that thing up!
Screw the neighbors!

23:45.132 --> 23:48.051
Uh, no, no. Doing the
dishes is my specialty.

23:48.636 --> 23:49.636
You're sweet, Wallace.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.304
Anyway, ain't you supposed
to be in bed?

23:51.472 --> 23:53.973
You think I'm going to trust
Chris alone with those
monsters?

23:55.935 --> 23:56.768
Get out of here.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.693
So.

24:06.529 --> 24:07.529
So.

24:10.825 --> 24:11.825
Okay.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.370
I, uh...

24:17.331 --> 24:19.582
I think I'm losing the
respect of an important
man in the house.

24:20.918 --> 24:21.918
Severide?

24:23.546 --> 24:25.922
Between this Benny, and...

24:26.841 --> 24:27.841
This Tara thing...

24:29.468 --> 24:31.010
I think he thinks
I'm the bad guy here.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.428
Nah.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.889
What's that you always say,

24:35.766 --> 24:37.350
"Leaders lead from the front?"

24:38.352 --> 24:39.352
Yeah.

24:39.770 --> 24:40.895
Sounds like me.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.776
Up front can be lonely,
that's for sure.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.361
But,

24:49.822 --> 24:51.364
it goes with the territory,
don't it?

24:55.828 --> 24:56.870
Yeah.

24:58.873 --> 24:59.914
Thanks.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.710
Again.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.094
Otis.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.096
You ready to lay claim
to your undies?

25:15.848 --> 25:16.806
Yeah, you wish.

25:16.974 --> 25:21.895
Just come clean, Otis.
No one will judge you.
This is a safe room.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.775
You know what? No.
I can't stand to look
at these another shift.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.110
Whoa!

25:29.278 --> 25:30.862
That's it.
Now I know
they're yours.

25:32.239 --> 25:36.618
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61,
vehicle accident.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.298
The Taurus there was just
pulling out of the hotel
parking lot when...

25:50.466 --> 25:52.717
Bam! The Trailblazer
hit it straight on.

25:52.885 --> 25:53.801
Thank you.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.011
We're on the Trailblazer.

26:04.063 --> 26:04.896
He's DOA.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.737
Ma'am, try not to
move until we get you
collared and braced.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.949
I need the report to say
we're just co-workers.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.618
We were coming from a lunch
when that jackass hit us.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.620
We don't report that
kind of stuff ma'am.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.122
I gotta get out of here.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.416
Ma'am, you need to
remain still.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.295
I need that collar.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.465
Here you go, Lieutenant.
Thanks.

26:33.217 --> 26:36.636
Struts, wedges and
cribbing... Stabilize that car
so you can get that woman out.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.347
You heard him.
Get that cribbing in place.
Capp! Center piece.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.684
Get the pipe down.

26:42.851 --> 26:43.768
How are we on the other side?

26:45.145 --> 26:47.313
All set!
Good, let's cut
that roof away.

26:55.698 --> 26:56.823
Watch the sparks!

27:00.452 --> 27:01.536
Roof's clear.

27:01.704 --> 27:02.704
"C" Collar!

27:04.456 --> 27:06.582
Copy that. Flying in.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.379
All right, you ready?
Take her out as straight
as possible.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.381
Where are
you taking me?

27:13.882 --> 27:14.757
Lakeshore.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.635
Will you call my husband
and tell him you found me
by myself?

27:17.803 --> 27:20.763
Ma'am... you're going to have
to take that up with the
doctors at the hospital.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.521
Hey, I'm going to need you to
cover me for an hour when
we get back to the station.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.689
You got it.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.363
You're supposed to stay
away from me.

27:37.865 --> 27:38.740
Am I?

27:43.120 --> 27:44.370
You're finished.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.497
You hear me?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.917
I am about to scream
so loud...

27:51.503 --> 27:52.837
Hi, Tara.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.098
He can't.

28:05.184 --> 28:08.019
He signed a...
A non-disclosure and
confidentiality agreement?

28:08.854 --> 28:09.854
What else can you
take away from him?

28:10.939 --> 28:13.900
I checked with the union
attorney and it turns out
in cases of fraud,

28:14.068 --> 28:15.818
the courts don't care much
about those agreements.

28:15.986 --> 28:16.944
Fraud?

28:17.112 --> 28:18.654
Maybe we take you to
criminal court.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.031
Get testimony on the record.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.158
Or you retract your lie,

28:22.326 --> 28:24.369
quit this job, and we never
see each other again.

28:37.758 --> 28:38.633
Excuse me.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.843
Yeah.
Hi. Um...

28:41.011 --> 28:42.804
Hi. I was the one that
asked about the pictures.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.764
Ah yeah, of course.
How are you?

28:44.932 --> 28:47.475
Hi. Uh, this is my
husband Roger.

28:47.643 --> 28:48.559
Hey, Roger.
Hey.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.145
And our daughter, Charlotte.

28:51.814 --> 28:52.814
Aww...

28:54.149 --> 28:55.149
Would you mind?

28:55.818 --> 28:57.735
No, no problem at all.
Come on Charlotte.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.821
I'll show you around
here. Come on!

29:00.239 --> 29:01.864
How old is she now?

29:02.032 --> 29:02.698
Uh, twelve.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.867
That's incredible.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.829
Yeah, plus today's her
birthday so...

29:08.580 --> 29:09.789
Here we are.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.124
She's really something.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.167
Yeah.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.295
Hey... Do you have a
few minutes, because

29:16.964 --> 29:20.049
I think we can do a
little better than a
couple of photos.

29:20.551 --> 29:21.926
Sure.
Yeah?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.094
All right.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.930
Get in there.
Okay.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.101
Hey, Chief.

29:30.269 --> 29:34.272
We got a kid's birthday party
in the common room and
they'd like to see you.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.066
You tell little Danny or
Billy or Leo

29:37.234 --> 29:38.985
happy birthday from
me, but I have

29:39.153 --> 29:41.112
a mountain of paperwork that
I need to get through.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.825
This one's important, Chief.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.289
Okay, where are
the other kids?

29:51.457 --> 29:52.748
It's not that kind
of party, Chief.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.877
Later I'll grab all the
guys and the truck and take a
picture together.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.045
Hey.

29:58.755 --> 29:59.881
Are you Chief Boden?

30:00.674 --> 30:03.426
Yes, I am. And are you
the birthday girl?

30:04.136 --> 30:05.094
Yeah.

30:05.262 --> 30:06.429
And what's your name?

30:07.055 --> 30:08.723
- Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.683
And how old
are you, Charlotte?

30:10.851 --> 30:11.976
12.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.311
Well, Charlotte...

30:14.354 --> 30:15.730
Happy birthday.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.110
Do you recognize me?

30:23.989 --> 30:25.448
Um...

30:26.116 --> 30:28.159
I'm sorry, no, I don't.

30:29.620 --> 30:30.912
Twelve years ago today

30:31.079 --> 30:33.748
I was left on the doorstep
of this firehouse.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.918
He said you were the
fireman who found me.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.468
I always wondered
what happened to you.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.599
I was adopted.
I live in Indiana now.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.437
Look at you.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.108
Don't you look great.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.153
She's always wanted
the truth...

31:05.572 --> 31:08.658
When my mom and dad
told me where I came from,
I had to come here.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.827
And I am very glad
that you did.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.289
Thank you.

31:15.791 --> 31:19.085
No, thank you, Charlotte.

31:20.087 --> 31:22.505
Because you have
made this chief...

31:27.094 --> 31:28.386
A very man happy today.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.055
Okay.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.265
Here we go.

31:34.017 --> 31:40.856
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you...

31:41.024 --> 31:44.819
Happy birthday
dear Charlotte

31:45.487 --> 31:49.156
Happy birthday to you!

32:08.385 --> 32:10.595
You'll still pay a twenty
dollar bounty on these briefs?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.722
If you're ready to admit
they're yours.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.683
You want to know
something curious?

32:16.518 --> 32:17.852
I looked at the tag here.

32:18.312 --> 32:22.231
Interesting that they're a
Japanese brand of underwear,
not sold in the United States.

32:23.859 --> 32:24.942
Japanese...

32:25.694 --> 32:27.236
The same language
you've been studying.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.863
That... That doesn't...
Japanese...

32:29.031 --> 32:31.490
The same proverbs you've
been spouting for weeks!

32:31.658 --> 32:34.118
One of which you used to
fleece me out of twenty bones.

32:41.918 --> 32:42.918
Fine.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.756
Thank you...

32:46.923 --> 32:47.965
Very much.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.094
Go ahead.
Go, tell everyone...
Get a good laugh.

32:52.262 --> 32:53.804
Oh, I will. I will.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.557
I've been dating a
Japanese woman.

33:00.562 --> 33:03.189
I'm doing everything
I can to impress her

33:03.357 --> 33:05.816
because quite frankly,
I'm not getting any younger.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.570
She mailed me the
underwear as a gift, so...

33:09.738 --> 33:10.988
That's a good sign, right?

33:11.156 --> 33:13.282
Wait, wait. Mailed?

33:14.159 --> 33:15.201
From where?

33:15.369 --> 33:16.869
Well, we've been, uh...

33:17.621 --> 33:19.830
Our relationship is, uh...

33:21.124 --> 33:24.377
We haven't actually met yet.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.213
An internet girlfriend?

33:27.381 --> 33:30.257
I've talked to her
on the phone. A lot.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.425
Right, right.

33:31.885 --> 33:32.760
How much have you
spent on her?

33:33.929 --> 33:34.929
Not much.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.391
Yeah, a little.

33:45.399 --> 33:48.567
Please don't bust my
balls on this Otis!

33:49.569 --> 33:50.736
Otis!

33:53.907 --> 33:55.950
Hey. Just the man
I was coming to find.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.452
I don't know if you've
heard, but miraculously,

33:58.620 --> 34:02.123
Tara Little has quit the
fire service and recanted
her testimony against you.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.083
Did she?

34:05.419 --> 34:06.460
What'd you do?

34:06.878 --> 34:07.920
Well, I...

34:08.088 --> 34:11.006
You know what?
I'd rather not know.

34:13.218 --> 34:15.302
It was on the up and up,
Chief. I promise you that.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.096
Kelly.

34:19.850 --> 34:20.975
Throughout all this,

34:22.144 --> 34:23.144
I never doubted you.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.814
I want you to know that.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.442
I just had to
be a Chief.

34:31.695 --> 34:32.820
I know.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.451
I appreciate it.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.423
Can we talk?

34:52.591 --> 34:53.716
Yeah.

34:54.968 --> 34:56.302
Uh, not here.

34:57.888 --> 34:58.929
Yeah.

35:01.057 --> 35:04.643
Apparently it happened at a
time when your mom and dad
were already separated.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.897
Boden and Ingrid...

35:08.064 --> 35:10.316
Got together, but Boden backed
away as soon as he found out

35:10.484 --> 35:12.026
that your dad and mom
might reconcile.

35:12.194 --> 35:14.945
And I... Didn't know
what to do with the
information.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.283
And I didn't think it was
my place to tell you, so
I just sat on it,

35:19.743 --> 35:21.577
but the more I thought about
how close we were getting,

35:21.995 --> 35:24.747
the more I thought that maybe
I should just tell you, so...

35:24.915 --> 35:26.040
Boden and my mom?

35:31.922 --> 35:33.631
And you knew about
this how long?

35:35.717 --> 35:37.802
Since the big banquet.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.811
Look, I know I should've
told you sooner. I know it.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.562
But you have to see it
from my point-of-view.

35:48.730 --> 35:49.855
Do I?

35:50.023 --> 35:51.774
Is that what I need
to do, Dawson?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.693
Peter, I'm sorry.

35:55.362 --> 35:56.695
If I'd known you'd have
this kind of reaction,

35:56.863 --> 35:58.280
I'd have just come right
home and told you then.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.991
But you didn't. Okay?

36:02.661 --> 36:03.702
I didn't know...

36:04.788 --> 36:05.955
I need to be alone.

36:09.376 --> 36:13.420
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Engine 51, Ambulance 61.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.924
Building Fire,
3331 W. Halsted Road.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.259
That's Hallie's clinic.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.116
Oh, God.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.875
Let's go! Why aren't
those hydrants open yet?

36:51.042 --> 36:53.878
We're going to
need this to get to that
area from the roof!

36:54.045 --> 36:56.505
My partner, Barnes,
he went in further!

36:56.923 --> 36:58.299
He found a woman but he
couldn't get to her!

37:06.141 --> 37:07.016
Hey,

37:08.226 --> 37:09.435
the back door is here.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.813
Fan out,
look for victims!
I'll stick with Casey!

37:21.197 --> 37:22.573
I couldn't reach her!

37:22.741 --> 37:23.657
Where?

37:24.951 --> 37:25.951
Get him out of here!

37:40.091 --> 37:42.009
Fire Department!
Call out!

37:45.221 --> 37:46.472
Hallie!

37:48.099 --> 37:49.725
Hallie!

37:56.608 --> 37:58.150
This is an oven. Everyone out!

37:59.694 --> 38:00.736
Hallie's in there.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.072
Who?

38:03.239 --> 38:04.323
His girl.

38:04.824 --> 38:05.950
Hallie!

38:07.577 --> 38:09.578
Casey, where are you?

38:17.087 --> 38:19.046
No, no, no.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.147
Casey, where the
hell are you?

38:49.285 --> 38:50.953
Casey! Casey!

38:56.793 --> 38:58.585
Talk to me!
Where the hell are you?

39:09.806 --> 39:11.640
We got her!
We're coming out!

39:19.858 --> 39:21.900
Get oxygen on her and
into the ambulance. Now!

39:22.068 --> 39:23.444
We'll lead the way.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.778
I'm coming.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.062
Breathe, Hallie! Breathe!

40:01.066 --> 40:02.441
Damn it, baby, breathe!

40:05.403 --> 40:06.528
Come on!

40:06.988 --> 40:11.700
Breathe!

40:11.868 --> 40:13.327
Damn it, girl!

40:16.498 --> 40:17.664
Breathe.
