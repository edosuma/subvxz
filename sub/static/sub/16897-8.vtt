01:07.901 --> 01:10.700
Mr. Drecker, you said it was urgent.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.833
I'm a bridesmaid. I'm getting measured.
It's important.

01:14.992 --> 01:18.292
How is it so important?
You look like a Smurf.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.627
Shh. You're gonna hurt
the bride's feelings.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.428
Oh, God. Oh God.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.184
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.351
This is really bad.
This is really, really bad.

01:40.517 --> 01:44.397
I am being a bad, bad bridesmaid.

01:44.563 --> 01:47.863
Oh, you have to stop.
Do not stop.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.447
But you have to.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.211
Oh, God.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.467
Oh, Mr. Breaker, I have duties.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.972
Yeah?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.384
Yeah, me too.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.058
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.898
Oh, I'm hanging in there.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.858
Um...

02:22.434 --> 02:24.232
I don't have my checkbook on me.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.146
- Oh, it's on the house.
- Mm.

02:28.523 --> 02:33.279
Yes, well, there's just... There's...
Fuck! Shit!

02:33.445 --> 02:36.073
Fuck. Ow.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.337
Mom, can I call you back?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.001
Are you Tanya Skeegel?

02:47.459 --> 02:49.882
It's "Skagle." It's Skagle.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.390
I don't know where you got “Skeegel."

02:53.548 --> 02:55.767
Yeah, I'm looking for a Charles St. John.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.054
Are you aware he's violated bail?

02:58.220 --> 03:02.191
You... You mean Charlie?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.943
Guys, come on. We're out of here.
- Excuse me.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.486
Hey, let's get out of here.

03:13.652 --> 03:14.995
- Come on.
- All right.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.826
Hold on. No, no, wait a second.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.160
Wait, wait, wait.

03:18.323 --> 03:22.203
- You're Missy, right? You're Missy.
- Yeah, I'm Missy.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.714
Hi, I'm Tanya. I think we met before.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.001
I'm a friend of Charlie's.
He's been staying at my house...

03:29.167 --> 03:31.340
- ...under house arrest.
- I had nachos.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.426
Oh, that's great.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.637
- They're nice kids.
- Where did he go?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.552
I don't know. Do you know?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.181
- Who are you looking for?
- Charlie, Missy.

03:42.347 --> 03:46.477
I'm looking for Charlie, and I thought
maybe that you could help me with that...

03:46.643 --> 03:48.566
if you wanted.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.277
Here's my number...

03:51.732 --> 03:57.080
and here's two Hamiltons, okay?

03:57.237 --> 04:00.958
And here's a Washington
to sweeten the deal.

04:01.116 --> 04:05.542
And there's more if you find him.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.715
God, Ray, I gotta tell you something.

04:08.874 --> 04:12.174
When I got Charlie out of jail,
I had to put up some money.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.680
- You gave that guy money?
- No, I didn't give it to him.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.591
Sandee, do you mind?

04:19.718 --> 04:23.313
I didn't give him money.
I put money up for him.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.191
Okay, because he has an alarm
on his ankle.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.602
Yeah. No, Ray, it's not a big deal.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.397
I posted his bail,
but ifs just a precaution.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.407
It's like when you
put your credit card down...

04:34.566 --> 04:38.241
for the minibar in a hotel room.
And it's fine. He'll be back in a few days.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.121
- He's gone?
- He's not gone.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.533
He's coming back.
His stuff is still at my house.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.703
Okay, he's coming back.
So, what are you telling me for?

04:52.626 --> 04:56.847
Excuse me, is this
the orgasmic living class?

04:59.549 --> 05:02.177
Mm. No words. Okay, you know what?
Never mind.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.597
I'm just gonna go in,
and thanks for your help.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.653
You guys, she's here.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.489
- Who?
- Lenore. She's here.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.868
Did you see who's out there?

05:19.027 --> 05:21.746
Yes, it was so weird.
It was like she didn't recognize me.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.579
- Should we hide?
- Ray... I can't deal with her today.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.914
I can't deal with that fucking cunt today.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.750
Relax, Tanya. You too, Sandee.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.165
It's just Lenore, okay? Just...

05:31.331 --> 05:34.005
Nobody's hiding from anybody.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.386
There's a catalog
called Good Vibrations.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.843
Excellent.
I watched a demo on YouTube...

05:39.005 --> 05:42.054
- ...and there's this golden vibrating bullet-
- Can I talk to you?

05:42.217 --> 05:45.517
One second. You wear it actually
around your neck like it's a necklace.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.808
But really, then later on,
you just take it off and tsk. And it goes.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.818
I didn't know you worked here.
You look so good.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.526
Look, lady, I didn't appreciate
that little Kyla stunt.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.532
That was fucked up.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.286
Get it straight:
We're not working together anymore.

06:01.444 --> 06:05.369
Ever. Okay? So get some new friends...

06:05.532 --> 06:08.832
and get lost. Go on.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.417
Actually, Ray, I have lots of new friends.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.880
In fact, one of them is here right now.
I'm so glad to see her.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.847
Jessica. I'm so glad you made it.
So good to see you.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.054
What?
- You gotta cancel.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.720
We can't cancel.
I can't cancel the class, Ray.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.312
Jessica is out there.
Lenore must've brought her to class.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.147
- Who's Jessica?
- My ex-wife.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.905
- I can't... I can't... She can't see me.
- No, no. Uh...

06:37.063 --> 06:39.316
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it. Uh...

06:39.482 --> 06:40.984
Okay.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.117
Okay. God. Ahem.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.544
Uh... Ladies, I am so happy
to see all of you here.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.205
'Welcome... Welcome to Orgasmic Living.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.505
I think I met her.
I think she's Ray's friend.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.669
- Your ex-husband Ray?
- Ahem.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.512
We're gonna start the class today
with a creative visualization.

07:04.674 --> 07:08.395
Okay, you're gonna close your eyes.
Close your eyes. That's right. Okay.

07:08.553 --> 07:12.399
So imagine that you're in a place
where you're completely comfortable.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.777
For me what works is
I'm ﬂoating down a river.

07:15.936 --> 07:20.066
All right? A lazy river.
And the river is whoosh, whoosh.

07:20.273 --> 07:25.495
River. I like to imagine that I'm on
an inner tube and I'm ﬂoating...

07:25.654 --> 07:29.750
down a lazy old river,
and I'm just ﬂoating on this lazy river.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.164
Floating, ﬂoating.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.672
- I'm calling the cops.
- What's the problem?

07:36.831 --> 07:40.802
- I thought you'd appreciate a new client.
- You know that Ray can't be here if she is.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.464
- You're choking the business.
- T-Brain, this is war...

07:43.630 --> 07:46.975
and Jessica's my H-bomb. You stole
my ideas for this wellness center.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.101
- And you know it.
- The wellness center is my idea.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.184
- Blah, blah, blah. What do you want?
- I want Jason back...

07:52.347 --> 07:54.896
and I wanna teach the class.
I'd be better at it.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.026
Women are more
instinctually drawn to me.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.904
My God, you're crazy.
The wellness center's mine.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.906
Until you give me what I want,
Tanya...

08:02.065 --> 08:05.035
I'm gonna keep coming back
to your lectures with Jessica...

08:05.193 --> 08:07.070
like it's my fucking job.

08:07.237 --> 08:10.366
And I'm gonna be your own
personal tapeworm, living up your ass...

08:10.532 --> 08:14.082
and you won't be able to shake me
until you self-destruct and die.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.211
Well, Ray,
what am I supposed to do?

08:19.374 --> 08:22.048
You know, Lenore's holding us hostage.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.508
She's using Jessica as a human shield.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.218
Okay, say the class is full.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.260
I can't, Ray.
The class is obviously not full.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.645
I tried that. There's a lot of chairs.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.809
Lenore is... She's got an agenda.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.940
She's like... She's like a weed.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.568
Okay, well, you rip weeds out
of the garden, Tanya.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.322
Sometimes the roots of the weed
are wrapped around the roots of the ﬂower.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.609
And if you rip out the weed,
you rip out the flower and it's dead.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.779
Then you have a dead flower
that knows you're a male prostitute.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.164
Enough with the fricking metaphors,
okay?

08:51.322 --> 08:53.791
It's not that hard. Just get...
Get her out.

08:53.950 --> 08:58.456
All right, I will. I'm doing it.
I will do it. It seems a shame, though.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.715
- What does?
- Jessica.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.627
She seemed to really be
embracing the material.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.420
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.557
I get the feeling that she's
always only thought of herself...

09:08.715 --> 09:10.513
as sort of a commodity, in a sense.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.394
I'm just saying
I think her sense of self, her identity...

09:13.553 --> 09:17.774
is very wrapped up in what
men think of her, in what you think of her.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.685
What, did she say something?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.363
It's not big.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.943
I'm just gonna say it. it's small.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.703
Jessica can speak to that.
- What?

09:31.613 --> 09:34.537
Penis size. Am I right?
You can speak to that.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.329
I'm not-I'm not really
comfortable talking in public.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.624
And you know what?
You don't have to share.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.417
You don't, if you don'! want to.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.882
Okay, okay, it's okay.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.268
My ex-husband...

09:53.426 --> 09:56.726
um, he had a...

09:59.349 --> 10:01.772
very large......

10:03.228 --> 10:04.696
For sure.

10:05.063 --> 10:08.158
You could say that it...

10:08.316 --> 10:11.695
didn't always do the trick.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.373
If that makes you feel any better. Ha-ha.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.245
- What did she mean "the trick"?
- What do you think she means?

10:22.705 --> 10:25.299
Are you saying she faked it with me?

10:25.708 --> 10:29.133
Ray, come on.
Everybody fakes it once in a while.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.219
- Do you?
- Well, no, I never fake it.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.305
- Neither does Jessica.
- Oh.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.970
All right? I did the trick.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.641
- I did the trick a lot.
- Okay, would you not be so reductionist?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.855
You know, it's very common.
A lot of women...

10:43.017 --> 10:46.692
don't have orgasms. They don't come.
It's not because they don't like sex...

10:46.855 --> 10:49.108
or the guy is doing something wrong.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.902
Listen, I've been batting a thousand
in that department.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.742
You've had a lot more practice.
You're a better lover now.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.827
I was a great lover then too.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.620
I can't just fire her, Mindy.
She could S-U-E.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.538
She seduced you.
You said she invited you to a musical.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.340
- Dr. Kopylov's office.
- That's not how it works.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.004
The boss is always the aggressor.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.173
Should have kept your dick in your scrubs.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.764
Oh, really? You wanna go there?
What about keeping your hands to yourself?

11:17.135 --> 11:20.639
I have six female employees here, okay?
They're gonna gang up against me.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.148
Women have a mob mentality.

11:22.307 --> 11:25.026
Well then fire her
for being a bad employee.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.146
Come in.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.947
Dr. Kopylov, the lab called.
They have Mr. Gummer's results.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.157
They need you to call immediately.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.572
Thanks.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.380
But I can't say, like, never ever.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.382
What?
- Not never ever, you know?

11:48.541 --> 11:52.387
Sometimes it... It does come in handy.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.967
It comes in handy?

11:55.340 --> 11:58.435
- Like with me?
- Like with all guys.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.096
You know, sometimes you just-
You get bored...

12:01.262 --> 12:05.938
or they seem like they really need it
and whatever, it just makes it easier.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.444
Can you get me the oil over there?

12:13.524 --> 12:15.868
Mr. Drecker, that's canola oil.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.620
Like when, with me?

12:17.779 --> 12:19.622
Like, um...

12:20.156 --> 12:23.706
Like that time in the Mustang.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.921
Which...? Which time?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.174
In the Mustang? Come on.

12:29.332 --> 12:32.256
You... You were into that.

12:32.418 --> 12:37.094
But it was kind of cold and I had
already come once so, you know...

12:37.632 --> 12:41.557
- But the other times?
- Yes, the other times I came.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.266
Yeah, you did.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.530
The trick.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.786
<i>Twenty years of marriage
and you find out she was faking it.</i>

12:58.987 --> 13:02.833
Why apologize? Let Tanya apologize.
You don't owe her anything.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.835
Well, she discovered me
and she gave me a career.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.998
No, she gave you a shitty TV
and then she broke it.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.712
I, Sandee, got you this gig.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.878
I don't know, okay?
Lenore is gonna be so mad at me.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.467
Who cares? Oh, fuck it.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.757
We are in the power position.

13:20.842 --> 13:24.016
Tanya and Lenore,
they are fighting over you.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.896
I don't feel that powerful.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.271
Well, you should. And you should
have a hand in the business.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.904
- Ray was here first.
- So take him out.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.774
What? How?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.944
- Screw his wife.
- Do what?

13:39.110 --> 13:42.239
Jason, did you see how scared he was?
If you screw his wife...

13:42.405 --> 13:46.410
it would be like a psychological,
nuclear, kamikaze knockout.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.120
<i>Pow.</i>

13:55.209 --> 13:57.507
<i>Jessica, alone with my pimp...</i>

13:58.338 --> 14:01.842
<i>in a classroom with a giant
vagina lamp in it.</i>

14:02.008 --> 14:04.386
<i>It wasn't "if" something would go wrong.</i>

14:04.552 --> 14:06.600
<i>It was just "what" and "when. ”</i>

14:14.812 --> 14:16.314
You wanted to see me?

14:19.984 --> 14:22.533
Jessica, here's the thing.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.825
Um, I love having you in my class...

14:26.991 --> 14:29.494
- ...but the thing is...
- I love being here too.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.798
Hey, can I ask you something
about the reading?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.674
You did... You did the reading?

14:35.833 --> 14:39.303
Yes. Oh, when lr...

14:39.796 --> 14:42.470
- Iri... How do you pronounce it?
- Irigaray.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.055
Irigaray. When she says:

14:45.218 --> 14:46.470
Um...

14:47.678 --> 14:54.232
"In the form of ambivalences that have
to be hierarchized in twinned pairs.“

14:54.394 --> 14:56.943
- Uh-huh.
- I'm sorry, what is she talking about?

14:57.105 --> 15:01.485
I think what she's talking about
is there's a male...

15:01.651 --> 15:06.657
or phallocentric way
of looking at the world and...

15:06.823 --> 15:08.746
You know, like black or white...

15:08.908 --> 15:12.913
or man-woman or virgin-whore.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.253
But women are not this one thing.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.214
Women are more complicated.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.719
Um...

15:19.877 --> 15:24.883
You, Jessica, you are not one.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.431
- What?
- Heh. That's just...

15:32.682 --> 15:35.435
I have never met anyone like you.
Ha-ha.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.731
But it is so odd
that you and Ray are friends.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.570
What do you talk about?

15:41.732 --> 15:45.362
- Do you talk about this?
- With Ray? No.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.866
No, Ray thinks this is
all a lot of baloney.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.875
Oh, it's not baloney. It's fascinating.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.832
I find it...

15:53.995 --> 15:55.793
and you...

15:56.789 --> 15:59.258
to be really inspirational.

15:59.417 --> 16:03.968
- You think so?
- You are so out there.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.474
Liberated.

16:08.342 --> 16:12.472
Listen, you don't tell Ray
what we talk about in class, right?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.106
Ray? Oh.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.853
No. God, of course not.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.821
I would love to read...

16:20.980 --> 16:23.108
Have I written a poem?
- ...whatever you want.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.276
I don't even understand poems.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.998
Look, I just was... My head exploded...

16:31.157 --> 16:34.377
when you came in and said that
you had even done the reading.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.084
- Oh.
- Can I...'?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.631
- Thank you. Thanks so much, really.
- Thank you.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.130
- Happiness.
- Reading.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.843
Bye, Jess.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.304
Wow.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.060
- Hey!
- She's gonna see you. Just get in the car.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.770
Get in the car. Get down.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.232
- Thanks again.
Bye-bye.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.442
Bye, Jess.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.858
- Hey! What'd she say?
- God, Ray.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.323
Was she upset? Did she talk about me?

17:08.486 --> 17:11.079
- I couldn't do it.
- What do you mean you couldn't do it?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.617
She's still in the class?
Look, I tried, Ray.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.502
I tried very hard, okay?
She's... She needs the class.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.959
She's... She's really...
She sees me as a confidant.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.874
- She's starting to really open up.
- She's starting to open...

17:22.040 --> 17:25.011
Come on. You and I both know
the class is a bunch of hooey...

17:25.169 --> 17:27.922
so that you can get clients
for me to screw.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.057
Not at all, Ray. Not entirely.

17:30.216 --> 17:34.096
It's revolutionary, what we're doing.
All right? It's helping women.

17:34.262 --> 17:37.516
And I am... I'm uniquely qualified
to talk to women about sexuality.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.231
Why, because you come a lot?
That makes you an expert?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.236
That wasn't my point,
but actually, yes.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.523
A lot of women would love to come
like I come.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.817
All right, listen, I've
been thinking, okay?

17:46.983 --> 17:48.610
This whole thing is a bad idea.

17:48.776 --> 17:52.872
All right? This Jason guy
is lurking around there...

17:53.030 --> 17:56.751
and you gotta talk to her, okay?
You gotta tell her. I mean...

17:57.243 --> 17:58.665
You know, I'm...

17:58.828 --> 18:01.832
I've learned a lot about
making women happy and I think that...

18:03.666 --> 18:06.340
- You could what?
- You know.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.005
Just talk to her, will you?

18:09.171 --> 18:12.345
You want me to advise Jessica
to have sex with you?

18:12.800 --> 18:15.394
Ray, I'm not doing it.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.773
I'm great at fucking, Tanya.
Just ask all those women.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.105
Okay, all right,
so you give her an orgasm. Then what?

18:23.561 --> 18:25.188
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.949
- Tanya, I don't knew.
- I'm not doing it, Ray. I'm just not.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.613
God, go home and get some rest.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.162
Fuck.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.082
Stupid.

19:00.848 --> 19:05.354
Hi. Uh...
Little Charlie and Desean, right?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.234
- Yeah.
- Ls your mom around?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.695
No. She said she'd pick us up tomorrow.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.573
Okay. Um...

19:15.196 --> 19:18.075
- How'd you guys get in?
- Mommy had a key.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.496
- Right.
- You got any Cheetos or anything?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.103
Hi.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.238
- How are you?
- I'm great, Jake. How are you?

19:54.610 --> 19:55.736
I feel bad.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.875
Awful about, uh...

20:03.369 --> 20:04.621
You know...

20:05.871 --> 20:08.044
Apology not accepted.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.514
Oh, hi.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.096
- Hi.
- I'm Jake.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.600
Hey. so I'm one
of the private consultants here...

20:25.766 --> 20:28.440
and I would really love
to work with you at some point.

20:30.521 --> 20:34.151
What does that mean exactly,
"work with me"?

20:35.401 --> 20:36.948
It's...

20:37.528 --> 20:39.405
- it's complex.
- Hmm.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.870
Why don't we meet
and I'll tell you more about it.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.705
No charge.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.963
I'm gonna sweat.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.796
I'm gonna sweat in this $3000 suit. Oh.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.380
She's gonna look up there and say:

20:55.546 --> 20:58.641
"Who the hell is this sweaty,
broke guy I'm marrying?" Ha-ha-ha.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.802
Any day now,
she's gonna wake up and hate me.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.392
Maybe.
- Huh'?

21:04.555 --> 21:07.855
Maybe she will, Mike.
It's impossible to tell.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.692
Ray, are you okay?

21:12.855 --> 21:15.654
Maybe you think she's having
a great time in bed...

21:15.816 --> 21:17.739
yelling her head off...

21:18.110 --> 21:22.206
and then you find out
she's been faking it, for years.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.667
Or maybe she's really satisfied, right?

21:29.497 --> 21:32.250
Maybe she's got a thing for doctors,
maybe she doesn't.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.877
Who knows?

21:35.044 --> 21:39.595
There's no way to see it coming, Mike.
It might all turn to shit...

21:39.757 --> 21:42.226
but maybe not. You know, maybe, uh...

21:43.427 --> 21:45.304
Maybe you'll live happily ever after.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.730
Oh. Hold on a second. Be right back.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.815
- Excuse me.
- Thanks, Ray.

21:51.977 --> 21:52.978
Hello.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.523
Ray,
I know we don't see eye to eye on this.

21:55.689 --> 21:59.239
<i>I'm telling you now so that
you don't get upset with me later.</i>

21:59.401 --> 22:00.823
Tell me what?

22:01.987 --> 22:04.206
Jessica has signed up for the practicum.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.333
<i>I just found out.</i>

22:06.492 --> 22:07.835
<i>Ray, you there?</i>

22:08.118 --> 22:10.837
Ray, look, I don't necessarily
think it's such a bad thing.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.587
<i>- When?
- What?</i>

22:13.749 --> 22:16.719
When is she having the practicum?

22:16.877 --> 22:19.255
<i>- I don't know.
- When is it?</i>

22:21.131 --> 22:22.553
It's tonight.

22:29.431 --> 22:33.186
Sometimes you should do the right
thing: face the facts and accept them.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.065
<i>Sometimes life isn't
what you want it to be.</i>

22:38.232 --> 22:40.360
<i>You just gotta shut up and take it.</i>

22:41.151 --> 22:43.324
<i>This was not one of those times.</i>

22:53.414 --> 22:57.009
<i>Sometimes you've just gotta
fuck things up royally and not even care.</i>

22:57.543 --> 22:59.420
- Hey. Ray-
- Hey.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.970
Are you okay?
- Ray.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.015
<i>Sometimes that's all you've got.</i>
