WEBVTT

00:03.921 --> 00:04.975
Oh.

00:07.747 --> 00:11.307
This is the last... last time.

00:11.331 --> 00:12.908
We...

00:12.932 --> 00:14.543
We can't be roommates who have sex.

00:14.567 --> 00:16.178
Lots of roommates have sex.

00:16.202 --> 00:18.301
Yeah, they're called married couples.

00:20.377 --> 00:22.267
Sorry.

00:22.291 --> 00:24.667
Do I have to go in to work?

00:24.691 --> 00:26.268
Well, at least you didn't cry like a baby

00:26.292 --> 00:28.460
in front of the entire station.

00:28.484 --> 00:30.095
I don't want to go either.

00:30.119 --> 00:33.748
Jack, you're not defined
by the worst thing you did,

00:33.772 --> 00:35.730
but you do have to own it.

00:35.754 --> 00:37.923
Yeah, but...

00:37.947 --> 00:39.106
Why does it got to be Maya?

00:39.130 --> 00:42.376
Well, she did you a favor
by not firing your ass.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.651
Chin up, roomie.

00:48.976 --> 00:50.761
Well, that's one way
to get to know me better.

00:52.837 --> 00:55.319
I find it is the fastest way.

01:07.659 --> 01:08.748
I thought you left.

01:08.772 --> 01:10.196
Do you want me to?

01:11.312 --> 01:12.854
No.

01:26.492 --> 01:27.709
Jackson.

01:38.793 --> 01:40.967
Nothing they teach you
in school means anything.

01:40.991 --> 01:42.436
She's 4 days old.

01:42.460 --> 01:43.852
Oh, always reject

01:43.876 --> 01:45.245
the first hotel room they show you.

01:45.269 --> 01:47.226
You're probably just
a smiling shape to her.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.371
And this one is important...

01:48.395 --> 01:50.662
never, ever send your food back
at a chain restaurant.

01:50.686 --> 01:53.573
Okay. I have something important
that you could tell her.

01:53.597 --> 01:54.988
What?

01:55.012 --> 01:56.263
Her name.

01:56.287 --> 01:57.682
Can we decide on one, please?

01:57.706 --> 01:59.933
I want her to meet my parents ASAP,

01:59.957 --> 02:01.242
especially my mother,

02:01.266 --> 02:03.839
who hasn't returned any of my calls

02:03.863 --> 02:06.020
since becoming a grandmother.

02:06.044 --> 02:08.756
So, what am I supposed to tell them?

02:08.780 --> 02:13.092
"Uh, Mom, Dad, please meet
our daughter... TBD."

02:14.079 --> 02:15.227
"TBD-ee."

02:15.251 --> 02:16.904
Okay, well, great bands
don't just pick a name

02:16.928 --> 02:18.180
out of thin air.

02:18.204 --> 02:19.595
You know, they wait for
something cool to happen

02:19.619 --> 02:21.530
and say, "Whoa. That's the name!"

02:22.154 --> 02:23.545
I'm gonna go for a run.

02:23.569 --> 02:24.682
Oh, great idea.

02:24.706 --> 02:26.445
- You know where you should run to?
- Mm?

02:26.469 --> 02:28.486
The store. For formula.

02:28.510 --> 02:29.867
TBD needs to eat.

02:29.891 --> 02:32.603
But you got two stores right here.

02:32.627 --> 02:33.600
I've already iced them.

02:33.624 --> 02:35.535
This store is closed.

02:36.153 --> 02:38.409
O... kay.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.788
Right. I'll be back.

02:50.641 --> 02:52.205
Warren. Big day.

02:52.229 --> 02:54.092
Yeah, big day.

02:54.116 --> 02:55.226
Mm-hmm.

02:55.250 --> 02:59.088
Sir, uh, I was
taking inventory of my supplies.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.166
There's a discrepancy.

03:00.190 --> 03:01.558
In what?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.228
Fentanyl.

03:03.252 --> 03:05.038
Yeah, um, three vials are missing.

03:05.062 --> 03:07.230
You counted.

03:07.254 --> 03:10.941
We counted, actually. Um, both of us.

03:12.797 --> 03:15.927
Well... need to file a police report.

03:17.922 --> 03:20.264
Fentanyl is a dangerous Schedule II drug.

03:20.288 --> 03:22.894
Yeah, it is. Um, um...

03:23.676 --> 03:25.832
Of course, you know, I report it,

03:25.856 --> 03:28.187
Dixon will shut down the PRT.

03:28.211 --> 03:29.322
Oh. Like, immediately.

03:29.346 --> 03:30.806
That's true.

03:32.975 --> 03:35.444
But you got to do the right thing...

03:35.468 --> 03:37.867
especially if you think
someone stole narcotics.

03:37.891 --> 03:39.953
Yeah.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.924
I don't know, maybe I...
maybe I just counted wrong.

03:44.948 --> 03:48.078
Well... count again.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.673
I will, sir.

03:55.735 --> 04:01.544
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:02.923 --> 04:04.586
Just keep that in mind.

04:04.610 --> 04:05.964
Chin up. Own it.

04:09.788 --> 04:12.551
My nose is broken.
My nose is still broken.

04:12.575 --> 04:14.174
The PRT will be here in a few minutes,

04:14.198 --> 04:15.450
as will Chief Dixon.

04:15.474 --> 04:17.003
Thank you all for sticking
around for the picture.

04:17.027 --> 04:18.452
Gibson, Vasquez, a word?

04:24.727 --> 04:26.568
Can you two work together?

04:28.488 --> 04:29.983
I have discretion here.

04:30.007 --> 04:33.207
This doesn't have to go
to Sullivan or Dixon.

04:34.398 --> 04:37.283
Why don't we start with an apology.

04:39.190 --> 04:40.650
Okay.

04:40.674 --> 04:42.343
Do I need to kick this upstairs?

04:42.367 --> 04:43.758
Do I need to suspend you both?

04:43.782 --> 04:44.962
Tell me.

04:46.989 --> 04:48.772
I apologize.

04:49.459 --> 04:51.801
I crossed a line.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.436
I'm man enough to own it.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.198
Vasquez, your turn.

04:55.222 --> 04:56.855
Come on.

04:58.490 --> 04:59.717
Fine.

04:59.741 --> 05:01.689
I apologize to you, Captain Bishop,

05:01.713 --> 05:03.104
for hitting him while on duty

05:03.128 --> 05:04.623
and not waiting until after hours.

05:04.647 --> 05:06.246
- Vasquez.
- That's all I've got, Captain.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.486
And that's all I need.

05:11.717 --> 05:13.316
You can go.

05:20.226 --> 05:21.686
Whoo, whoo!
It's here, it's here, it's here!

05:21.710 --> 05:23.762
She gets like this when we get towels.

05:23.786 --> 05:25.977
Ah! Ah-ha-ha!

05:28.690 --> 05:31.333
- Hey-hey!
- Huh?

05:31.357 --> 05:32.896
Huh? Come on.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.858
Whoo!

05:33.882 --> 05:35.482
Huh? Thank you.

05:35.506 --> 05:37.211
Means a lot to me that you're all here.

05:37.235 --> 05:38.671
And, uh, oh, I-I want to introduce you

05:38.695 --> 05:41.512
to the honorary physician.

05:43.723 --> 05:46.796
So, does it turn into
a hospital, like a Transformer?

05:46.820 --> 05:48.710
No. It is a hospital.

05:48.734 --> 05:51.388
Oh, yeah, but where is
the crappy cafeteria food

05:51.412 --> 05:53.232
and the smell of sadness, huh?

05:53.256 --> 05:55.176
Very nice, Warren.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.359
Very nice.

05:56.383 --> 05:58.656
This will make page 3 or 4 of local news.

06:00.056 --> 06:01.667
O-Oh, we're doing that? Okay.

06:02.631 --> 06:03.789
Okay.

06:03.813 --> 06:06.399
19, like you to meet your newest probie.

06:06.423 --> 06:08.188
Now, don't be fooled
by his pretty-boy looks.

06:08.212 --> 06:09.475
He's tough as nails.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.889
Don't be afraid to put him
through the wringer.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.631
Hey, guys, uh, it's great to be here.

06:13.656 --> 06:16.137
I'm, uh, Emmett... Emmett Dixon.

06:16.162 --> 06:18.247
And, uh, yeah, it's nice to meet you all.

06:18.271 --> 06:21.413
It's my son. The firefighter!

06:21.627 --> 06:23.100
All right, come on.
I got five more minutes.

06:23.124 --> 06:25.069
Uh...

06:27.469 --> 06:29.324
See you got a second wind.

06:29.349 --> 06:30.577
Well, I feel good,

06:30.602 --> 06:32.247
and I want to make a difference.

06:32.272 --> 06:34.204
Well, good.
I prefer that to making noise.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.824
Do me proud, boys.

06:37.849 --> 06:40.261
Can you do me a favor?

06:40.286 --> 06:42.905
Um, would you go easy on my kid?

06:42.930 --> 06:45.240
He may not be a natural,
but he's a hard worker.

06:45.265 --> 06:46.285
He'll get it.

06:46.310 --> 06:47.943
Of course.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.337
Herrera?

06:54.316 --> 06:56.206
Hey, uh, I w...

06:56.231 --> 06:58.468
I need to know how you're doing.

06:58.493 --> 07:01.983
The blizzard...
it was... an emotional night.

07:02.008 --> 07:04.559
Yes.

07:04.584 --> 07:07.647
- I'd never delivered a baby before.
- Right.

07:07.681 --> 07:11.031
And..my dad...

07:11.055 --> 07:12.938
Yeah.

07:12.962 --> 07:14.712
Warren's little show put us behind,

07:14.736 --> 07:16.800
so I'm... I'm gonna go.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.539
Andy.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.331
Um, it matters to me how you are.

07:22.355 --> 07:24.767
If there's anything I can do, just...

07:25.387 --> 07:27.347
Uh, thanks. I'm okay, Chief.

08:00.603 --> 08:03.001
Well, it's gonna take me a couple of days

08:03.026 --> 08:04.498
to learn what all these things do.

08:04.523 --> 08:06.160
Oh, you don't have to learn
what all these things do.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.483
We covered the bases

08:07.508 --> 08:08.584
- when we went over sterile technique.
- Yeah.

08:08.608 --> 08:09.836
Look, I'm a surgeon,

08:09.860 --> 08:12.236
and I've got a certified
registered nurse anesthetist.

08:12.260 --> 08:14.498
Where is she? Ah, there she is.

08:14.522 --> 08:16.690
Pruitt Herrera, Claudia Flores.

08:16.714 --> 08:20.625
_

08:20.750 --> 08:21.874
_

08:21.898 --> 08:22.813
And I was his boss,

08:22.837 --> 08:24.413
so I'm very surprised to hear that.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.905
I'm gonna finish checking the equipment.

08:27.727 --> 08:29.303
Um, look, I'm gonna need you

08:29.327 --> 08:31.565
to assist in surgery as necessary,

08:31.589 --> 08:34.347
and, uh, you know, drive.

08:34.371 --> 08:36.471
Mm, so, I'm a glorified chauffeur, huh?

08:37.539 --> 08:39.114
Structure fire response.

08:39.138 --> 08:42.802
Possible aircraft crash
for Ladder 19, Engine 19,

08:42.826 --> 08:44.403
PRT 19...

08:44.427 --> 08:47.500
...Engine 23, Aid 19, and Aid 23.

08:47.524 --> 08:49.447
Aircraft crash? Like a plane crash?

08:49.471 --> 08:51.709
- Reported injuries at Conifer Plaza.
- First time for everything.

09:06.692 --> 09:09.040
Move faster next time, Probie.

09:09.065 --> 09:11.009
You're on desk duty now.

09:45.081 --> 09:46.836
Man...

09:47.823 --> 09:50.255
I didn't see that coming.

09:53.602 --> 09:55.248
What happened to you?

09:56.321 --> 09:59.701
Um, I... I have
this nerve thing in my leg.

09:59.725 --> 10:03.355
No, no, Bob, your moral compass.

10:03.379 --> 10:06.312
I must have tried 30 times
to make you have a second beer,

10:06.336 --> 10:08.712
and look at you now...

10:08.736 --> 10:10.243
literally shooting up
in your own firehouse.

10:10.267 --> 10:11.565
It's... It's pain.

10:11.589 --> 10:14.522
- It's real. I mean...
- Hey, hey, whose pain isn't "real"?

10:15.223 --> 10:17.585
Surely you're starting to get that.

10:17.609 --> 10:19.428
And even if you do everything perfectly,

10:19.452 --> 10:22.247
follow every rule by the letter,

10:22.271 --> 10:25.169
life still hands you
some pretty bitter lemons.

10:27.837 --> 10:30.613
But you just keep that bitter face on.

10:31.977 --> 10:33.414
What a waste.

10:35.248 --> 10:38.529
You see, all you need is what
you've always needed, Bob...

10:38.553 --> 10:39.572
more sugar.

10:46.137 --> 10:48.271
Please don't tell anybody
that I got excited

10:48.295 --> 10:50.045
- by the words "reported injuries."
- Hmm.

10:50.069 --> 10:52.690
Well, I'd be excited, too,
if I could find the siren.

10:52.714 --> 10:54.046
There is a siren, right?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.055
Of course there is.

10:55.079 --> 10:57.630
It's... It's right, um... It's right...

10:57.654 --> 10:59.439
Do you want me to make a siren sound?

11:01.969 --> 11:04.728
You know, um, the owner of Grey Sloan

11:04.753 --> 11:06.712
is the best urologist in the country.

11:06.737 --> 11:08.314
I-I could set up a consult.

11:08.339 --> 11:10.402
Good God, my daughter got to you, too.

11:10.427 --> 11:12.351
Well, she cares about you, all right?

11:12.376 --> 11:13.396
And so do I.

11:13.421 --> 11:14.580
Well, then stop it.

11:14.605 --> 11:16.529
I'm starting to wish
that your wife had lied,

11:16.554 --> 11:18.050
"It's benign.

11:18.075 --> 11:19.512
See you in six months."

11:19.537 --> 11:21.982
Then we'd be talking about
how bad the Mariners suck,

11:22.007 --> 11:23.061
like normal people,

11:23.086 --> 11:24.210
and I could die in peace.

11:24.235 --> 11:26.821
Well, I'm just telling you,
you have options.

11:26.846 --> 11:28.129
Well, then stop it.

11:28.678 --> 11:30.289
On Saturday, there was a blizzard.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.473
Today it's 70.

11:31.498 --> 11:33.805
At this rate,
the world will end before I do.

11:40.806 --> 11:42.800
Well just changed the diaper.

11:42.824 --> 11:44.852
- It was... messy!
- Ugh.

11:44.876 --> 11:46.523
Oh, well, you have to check
all in her vagina for poop

11:46.547 --> 11:48.193
so she doesn't get an infection.

11:48.217 --> 11:49.828
- Eeee.
- What?

11:49.852 --> 11:51.463
Uh...

11:51.487 --> 11:53.759
My mom referred to my sister's situation

11:53.783 --> 11:54.977
as her "cookie."

11:55.001 --> 11:56.508
You are not serious.

11:56.532 --> 11:58.944
- Yeah.
- Okay, "cookie" is unacceptable,

11:58.968 --> 12:00.753
and "situation" is worse,

12:00.777 --> 12:03.362
because, "A," that's how girls
get repeatedly molested.

12:03.386 --> 12:05.415
- Whoa!
- Because they'll say,

12:05.439 --> 12:06.493
"Someone touched my cookie,"

12:06.517 --> 12:07.676
and no one will know to call the cops.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.495
And, "B," if you had
referred to my "situation"

12:10.519 --> 12:12.176
when we first met,
we would have never done

12:12.201 --> 12:13.464
the things we did to make a baby.

12:13.489 --> 12:16.631
Okay, no. I-I mean, yet... it's diff...

12:18.048 --> 12:19.869
Erase. Erase.

12:19.894 --> 12:21.923
You are such a prude.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.302
Whoa. I am not a prude.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.682
- I'm not.
- Dean, try to keep

12:24.707 --> 12:25.882
your sense of humor, okay?

12:25.907 --> 12:27.205
Parenting is hard.

12:27.230 --> 12:28.424
Like, every mom on Insta is all,

12:28.449 --> 12:29.956
"Oh, look at my perfect tiny person,"

12:29.981 --> 12:31.940
but they're not showing you
pictures of the spit-up

12:31.965 --> 12:32.985
or the screaming

12:33.010 --> 12:34.725
or the rock-hard, giant milk balls

12:34.750 --> 12:35.944
that used to be perfect boobs

12:35.969 --> 12:37.127
or the stretched-out labia.

12:37.152 --> 12:39.050
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:39.266 --> 12:40.843
You're right. I'm sorry.

12:40.868 --> 12:41.853
It's hard.

12:41.878 --> 12:43.242
Dean, you have a daughter.

12:43.267 --> 12:45.400
You have to learn to be okay
with naming her parts.

12:45.424 --> 12:48.045
Look, I'm fine with her parts.

12:48.069 --> 12:49.627
Say "labia."

12:49.864 --> 12:51.685
No.

12:51.710 --> 12:53.634
What are you gonna do
when she gets her period,

12:53.659 --> 12:55.758
- pretend it's coming out her butt?
- What? No.

12:55.783 --> 12:57.568
Would you stop, please?

12:57.593 --> 12:59.621
Okay, baby, one more piece of advice...

12:59.646 --> 13:01.849
don't ever date a guy
who can't say "labia."

13:04.867 --> 13:06.235
You two better have your mess handled.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.454
I'm not gonna die today

13:07.479 --> 13:09.473
because you can't keep it
in your turnouts.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.631
We're good. Brothers.

13:11.656 --> 13:13.093
Right, Vasquez?

13:13.118 --> 13:14.939
The city pays me.

13:14.964 --> 13:17.363
They say ride with you, I ride.

13:28.070 --> 13:29.020
Um, hello?

13:29.044 --> 13:30.921
Hi. How are you?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.404
Do you work here?

13:33.428 --> 13:35.282
No. Do you?

13:35.306 --> 13:38.623
Yes, and I'm not sure that
you're supposed to be here.

13:38.647 --> 13:40.084
I'm probably not.

13:41.152 --> 13:43.702
Actually, definitely not.

13:43.726 --> 13:45.860
Okay, well, would you mind
leaving, then, please?

13:45.884 --> 13:47.425
Why?

13:47.449 --> 13:48.574
Does someone need the bed?

13:48.598 --> 13:50.974
No, it's just that
this is a fire station.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.018
Oh, I know.

13:52.042 --> 13:54.147
That's why I come here...

13:54.171 --> 13:56.234
for the shower and the bed.

13:56.258 --> 13:57.661
Sidewalks get hard,

13:57.685 --> 14:00.479
and the shelters are overcrowded.

14:00.503 --> 14:03.366
Look, I'm not gonna tell you again, okay?

14:03.390 --> 14:05.616
Damn, I miss pillows.

14:24.291 --> 14:26.240
We have two sites here! Let's move!

14:26.265 --> 14:27.493
Cutler, Cruz,

14:27.518 --> 14:29.199
head to the food-truck area
across the street.

14:29.224 --> 14:31.914
Everyone else, we have got to
deal with this gasoline leak.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.063
Set up a containment boom!

14:33.088 --> 14:35.396
Keep that gas out of the street!

14:37.161 --> 14:38.738
Wait a second.

14:38.763 --> 14:41.241
- The call was an aircraft explosion.
- Yeah?

14:41.266 --> 14:43.156
Well, where's the plane?

14:43.181 --> 14:44.548
Let Search & Rescue figure that out.

14:44.573 --> 14:45.872
Our job is to shut down that pump.

14:45.897 --> 14:46.916
Montgomery!

14:46.941 --> 14:48.850
Emergency shutoff's been
damaged. I can't stop it.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.208
Okay, we need to get
that truck out of here.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.635
Where's the driver?

14:51.660 --> 14:54.002
Would the driver of the
fuel tank please step forward?

14:54.027 --> 14:55.708
There's nothing on the news
about a missing plane.

14:55.733 --> 14:57.762
Would the driver of this fuel tank

14:57.787 --> 14:59.189
please step forward?!

14:59.214 --> 15:00.895
- Go look for keys.
- All right.

15:06.116 --> 15:08.736
Captain, I don't think we know
what we're dealing with.

15:18.777 --> 15:20.105
Hughes, what's your status?

15:20.130 --> 15:21.747
Driver must have taken the keys.

15:21.771 --> 15:23.262
Get out of there. Fire's at your feet!

15:23.287 --> 15:24.892
Listen up!

15:24.930 --> 15:26.610
Montgomery, Hughes, Olson, Reese,

15:26.635 --> 15:28.316
you're with me at the gas station.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.767
Herrera and Vasquez,
deal with the fires by the food trucks.

15:30.791 --> 15:32.855
Aid 23, assist with patient care.

15:32.879 --> 15:33.933
Don't you need my help here?

15:33.957 --> 15:35.395
I need you to put out the small fires

15:35.419 --> 15:37.134
so we don't have sparks
re-igniting the gas

15:37.158 --> 15:38.248
once we get it out.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.233
I also need you to stop questioning me.

15:40.257 --> 15:41.451
Gibson?

15:41.475 --> 15:43.782
Yeah, I'll go help Herrera and Vasquez.

15:43.806 --> 15:45.660
Reese, you're on the deck gun.

15:45.684 --> 15:46.808
Hit the tanker.

15:46.832 --> 15:48.827
Keep it cool until we get
the phone line up.

15:48.851 --> 15:50.671
Everyone else, pull hose line for foam.

15:50.695 --> 15:51.888
That tanker could blow. It's...

15:51.912 --> 15:53.419
Could blow if the temp hits 500 degrees.

15:53.443 --> 15:54.776
Get me the thermal imaging camera.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.246
We should evac
and let it burn itself out.

15:57.270 --> 15:58.778
There are underground tanks.

15:58.802 --> 16:01.317
If the tanker blows,
the whole block is a mushroom cloud.

16:01.341 --> 16:03.508
Get me the camera now.

16:08.787 --> 16:10.850
Go deep, Rigo. I got this.

16:10.874 --> 16:12.068
Make way, make way!

16:12.092 --> 16:13.473
Jack, don't push it.
We're good. I got this.

16:13.498 --> 16:14.852
Chin up, right?

16:16.273 --> 16:17.432
What do you got?

16:17.456 --> 16:18.859
Uh, looks like a bunch of small injuries.

16:18.883 --> 16:21.155
Can you jump in on those
while I take care of the fire?

16:21.179 --> 16:23.104
Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:23.128 --> 16:24.564
I'll, uh... I'll help where I can.

16:24.588 --> 16:25.782
Can I help?

16:25.806 --> 16:27.495
Looks like you already have a job...

16:27.519 --> 16:28.852
playing doctor instead of

16:28.876 --> 16:30.557
- getting treatment for your cancer.
- Andrea...

16:30.581 --> 16:32.122
You know, there's a drug trial at U Dub.

16:32.146 --> 16:33.514
They need volunteers.

16:33.538 --> 16:35.289
Half the people get a pill
that make them sicker.

16:35.313 --> 16:36.888
The other half get a sugar pill.
No, thanks.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.011
You'd be helping people and science...

16:39.035 --> 16:40.438
both things you love.

16:40.462 --> 16:42.107
Which is exactly why I joined
the Physician Response Team.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.534
But, this way,

16:43.558 --> 16:45.065
I get to spend more time
with my daughter,

16:45.089 --> 16:46.909
instead of half the day
with my head in the toilet.

16:46.933 --> 16:49.170
Yeah, real quality time here, Dad.

16:51.073 --> 16:52.440
Oh, my God.

16:52.464 --> 16:54.215
Did you tell Sullivan?

16:54.872 --> 16:56.128
Did he know?

16:56.152 --> 16:58.356
Is that why he didn't make me Captain?

16:58.380 --> 17:00.652
How about we work now, talk later?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.298
Hey, w-what are you two doing there?

17:09.323 --> 17:11.700
What we should have done
a lot more of a lot sooner.

17:11.724 --> 17:12.988
Why? You gonna tell on us?

17:13.012 --> 17:14.763
You gonna write us up, Chief?

17:16.146 --> 17:17.827
No, but this is a slippery slope.

17:17.852 --> 17:19.253
If you love someone in your firehouse,

17:19.279 --> 17:21.099
you... you may lose judgment

17:21.125 --> 17:23.270
and the morale of the company,
and lives are at stake.

17:23.295 --> 17:24.951
People may die.

17:25.509 --> 17:26.945
You can't let yourself love.

17:26.971 --> 17:28.652
Hey, hey, if you could stop yourself

17:28.677 --> 17:29.836
from loving who you love...

17:29.861 --> 17:31.820
Then I'd say you're already dead.

17:31.845 --> 17:34.118
And in terms of a slippery slope...

17:34.143 --> 17:35.197
I'd say you're at least

17:35.222 --> 17:38.155
two doses past slippery slope.

17:41.655 --> 17:42.744
What's the temp?!

17:42.769 --> 17:44.624
300 degrees and climbing!

17:44.649 --> 17:46.086
As long as that gas is flowing,

17:46.111 --> 17:47.548
we're fighting a losing battle!

17:47.573 --> 17:48.941
I can stop it.

17:48.966 --> 17:50.960
I already tried. The shutoff's smashed.

17:50.985 --> 17:53.431
No, I'm not gonna shut it off.
I'm gonna clamp it.

17:53.456 --> 17:56.251
That pump is in the middle
of a lake of burning gasoline.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.952
We'll keep throwing
a blanket of foam on it.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.527
Every step she takes through that foam

18:00.552 --> 18:01.955
exposes the burning gas to air.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.174
It will flash over.

18:03.199 --> 18:04.705
Not necessarily.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.933
Your boots will be soaked
in gas, your turnouts.

18:06.958 --> 18:08.757
- All it takes...
- Make it a thick blanket.

18:08.782 --> 18:10.150
I'll be fine.

18:13.029 --> 18:13.944
Get the clamp.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.085
First things first.

18:19.110 --> 18:20.269
You take the top corner,

18:20.294 --> 18:21.836
and you fold it down like that,

18:21.861 --> 18:24.398
and you place the baby on top of it...

18:24.423 --> 18:26.312
...and then...

18:26.337 --> 18:27.705
and then you take the left side

18:27.730 --> 18:29.133
and you bring it over...

18:29.158 --> 18:32.056
...and you strangle the baby
until it can't breathe anymore.

18:32.081 --> 18:33.240
Are you paying attention?

18:33.265 --> 18:34.857
Yeah, it's like folding
a burrito. I get it.

18:34.882 --> 18:37.502
You don't make your own
burritos, so just show me after.

18:37.527 --> 18:39.452
Look, why do I need to know
how to do this if you do?

18:39.477 --> 18:40.880
Well, because I'm not
always gonna be here,

18:40.905 --> 18:43.107
and sometimes you will have to swaddle.

18:43.132 --> 18:44.382
Look, I'll just look it up on YouTube.

18:46.262 --> 18:49.357
See how much she likes it?

18:50.561 --> 18:51.617
Look, you should call your parents.

18:51.642 --> 18:53.635
Why? Because they can help.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.411
Look, they have money
for night nurses and nannies.

18:55.436 --> 18:57.534
I'm not asking my parents
to pay for a night nurse.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.588
- Why not?
- Because we're fully capable

18:59.613 --> 19:01.084
of taking care of this child ourselves.

19:01.109 --> 19:02.047
Disagree.

19:02.961 --> 19:04.329
Chimichanga.

19:04.354 --> 19:05.618
What?

19:05.643 --> 19:07.150
Well, we're fighting
about making a burrito,

19:07.175 --> 19:08.542
but burrito is a stupid name.

19:08.567 --> 19:09.622
Chimichanga, though...

19:09.647 --> 19:11.188
Absolutely not.

19:11.213 --> 19:12.755
It's cute! We can call her Chimi.

19:12.780 --> 19:14.461
No.

19:16.145 --> 19:17.583
That's enough!

19:17.608 --> 19:19.462
Hey, hey, go slowly.

19:19.487 --> 19:20.751
One step at a time.

19:20.776 --> 19:22.805
The diesel mixed with water
is very slick.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.266
Whenever you're ready.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.285
Hey, I'm here, right behind you.

19:26.310 --> 19:27.504
You take a step, I fill it in.

19:27.529 --> 19:28.688
I'm not gonna let it re-ignite.

19:28.713 --> 19:29.733
Okay.

19:48.459 --> 19:50.453
Just another 20 steps to go.

20:32.019 --> 20:33.281
Okay, it's off!

20:35.463 --> 20:38.744
Now head back the way you came,
nice and slow!

20:38.768 --> 20:41.493
Okay.

20:48.266 --> 20:50.399
Aah! Aah!

20:50.423 --> 20:52.695
Run, Vic!

20:52.719 --> 20:54.922
Run, Vic! Just run!

20:54.946 --> 20:56.732
Run! Vic, run!

20:57.834 --> 20:58.992
Run, Vic! Run!

20:59.016 --> 21:00.697
- Get out! Just run!
- Run!

21:15.666 --> 21:16.896
Come on.

21:16.921 --> 21:18.949
Seriously, I don't want
to have to call the cops, here.

21:18.974 --> 21:20.412
Cops don't care.

21:20.437 --> 21:21.631
They're the ones who told me

21:21.656 --> 21:22.953
you guys have showers and beds.

21:22.978 --> 21:24.973
Are you for real?

21:24.998 --> 21:28.418
Young man, Jesus said to feed the poor,

21:28.443 --> 21:30.923
give them the shirt off your own back.

21:30.948 --> 21:33.500
Are you Christian or not?

21:33.525 --> 21:35.240
I mean, I was raised Catholic,

21:35.265 --> 21:37.641
but that doesn't really matter here.

21:39.338 --> 21:41.227
You're really gonna make me
go get the Chief, huh?

21:41.525 --> 21:44.771
You should do what you need to do.

21:44.796 --> 21:47.521
I'm gonna finish my sandwich.

21:53.832 --> 21:55.931
Look, Joe

21:56.392 --> 21:57.829
I really don't want to have to go

21:57.854 --> 21:59.078
and get any of the other guys here.

21:59.103 --> 22:01.195
I'm new. I'm the Chief's son.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.553
And they're gonna think I'm dumb

22:02.578 --> 22:03.948
if I have to ask them
how to get rid of you.

22:03.973 --> 22:06.767
So can you please just do me
this solid and... and...

22:08.498 --> 22:11.257
Firefighter Dixon, I sleep on the ground.

22:11.282 --> 22:13.728
I have painful gout
and no medication for it.

22:13.753 --> 22:16.756
My kids haven't spoken to me
in over a decade.

22:16.781 --> 22:19.436
My last good friend
stole my tent from me,

22:19.461 --> 22:21.664
and the one before that
died right in front of me.

22:21.689 --> 22:23.370
I suffered through a blizzard last week,

22:23.395 --> 22:25.110
and there was no room in the shelter...

22:25.135 --> 22:26.573
a blizzard in Seattle,

22:26.600 --> 22:28.454
which, if anyone were paying attention,

22:28.478 --> 22:31.125
is a terrifying reflection
on the state of the planet.

22:32.408 --> 22:35.838
Everything I just listed
is a real problem.

22:38.571 --> 22:41.470
"The other guys will think I'm dumb"

22:42.114 --> 22:43.795
is not a real problem.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.556
Is this organic?

22:57.700 --> 22:59.138
Fire's out, tanker's cooled down.

22:59.163 --> 23:00.183
Good work.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.293
You okay?

23:03.439 --> 23:04.737
I'm a little gassy.

23:04.762 --> 23:06.792
No.

23:09.044 --> 23:10.482
Oh, wow!

23:10.507 --> 23:11.491
I got evicted.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.438
It's a long story involving my landlady

23:16.463 --> 23:17.797
and a drippy faucet and my...

23:17.822 --> 23:19.397
my poor impulse control.

23:19.422 --> 23:21.347
But I'm out on my ass,
and I haven't found a new place.

23:21.372 --> 23:22.601
But, you know, I sleep at the station

23:22.626 --> 23:23.924
three nights a week anyway,

23:23.949 --> 23:25.601
so I've just been kind of
living at Jackson's place.

23:25.626 --> 23:26.750
But I kind of forgot to tell him.

23:27.848 --> 23:30.225
You know, so I've just kind of,
like, had my stuff there.

23:30.250 --> 23:33.079
But it's not like he notices,
because he lives in a palace.

23:33.104 --> 23:34.263
And I know I really should have told him,

23:34.288 --> 23:35.794
but he's got 800-thread-count sheets

23:35.819 --> 23:37.187
and an espresso machine, so I didn't.

23:37.212 --> 23:38.893
And you know what?
I almost died just then

23:38.918 --> 23:40.460
so, you know, I just felt like

23:40.485 --> 23:41.644
I had to say something out loud.

23:41.669 --> 23:43.893
You know what I mean?

23:46.996 --> 23:48.712
Is that bad?

23:48.736 --> 23:51.551
- It's incredibly bad.
- Y-Yes. That's super terrible.

23:54.519 --> 23:57.035
See, when you die......

23:57.060 --> 24:00.571
and you will die one day,
I can assure you of that...

24:00.596 --> 24:02.869
Bobby, what do you want to be able to say

24:02.894 --> 24:05.026
about your time on Earth, hmm?

24:05.051 --> 24:07.324
That you did a good job?

24:07.349 --> 24:09.622
Or that you loved and were loved?

24:09.647 --> 24:11.501
Can't I have both?

24:11.526 --> 24:12.685
Well, you can, but

24:12.710 --> 24:14.391
It's harder if you get the order wrong.

24:14.416 --> 24:16.862
You see, people, me included,

24:16.887 --> 24:18.846
they think that if you do a good job,

24:18.871 --> 24:20.482
then you will be loved

24:20.507 --> 24:21.735
and will finally have the time to love.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.850
It's wrong.

24:22.875 --> 24:24.103
Work is never finished.

24:24.128 --> 24:25.407
The job is never done perfectly enough.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.216
And meanwhile, the people who need you

24:27.240 --> 24:29.507
and want you and see the real you,

24:29.531 --> 24:31.935
they wait and they wait

24:31.960 --> 24:33.154
and they wait.

24:33.179 --> 24:34.163
I had love.

24:34.188 --> 24:36.461
I had Claire.

24:36.486 --> 24:38.271
Claire would want you to be happy.

24:38.296 --> 24:40.256
And Claire is gone, my friend.

24:40.281 --> 24:42.052
You... You are not gone.

24:43.147 --> 24:45.615
Not yet, anyway.

24:47.844 --> 24:49.525
I think I have a problem.

24:49.550 --> 24:52.471
I know you have a problem.

24:53.717 --> 24:55.641
What are you gonna do about it?

24:55.666 --> 24:57.625
I-I don't know what to do about it.

24:57.650 --> 24:58.914
It's not surprising.

24:58.939 --> 25:01.698
You were good at almost everything...

25:01.723 --> 25:03.502
except asking for help...

25:04.754 --> 25:06.366
which may be your downfall.

25:08.792 --> 25:11.852
Irony can be ugly. Am I right?

25:13.524 --> 25:15.331
I'm really high.

25:17.234 --> 25:18.637
And I'm still hurting.

25:18.661 --> 25:19.980
Hurting is living.

25:22.483 --> 25:24.813
_

25:25.515 --> 25:27.515
_

25:30.482 --> 25:32.859
Well, if you can't get it
in your first language,

25:32.884 --> 25:35.087
I'm never gonna reach you.

25:37.309 --> 25:39.063
Well, where are you going?

25:39.228 --> 25:41.291
I need to get out of here.

25:41.316 --> 25:44.167
- I need to get...
- It's time to let go, my friend.

25:45.308 --> 25:47.510
It's time to change your life.

25:47.535 --> 25:50.491
All of it, from the top down.

25:51.192 --> 25:53.702
These chances
don't come around every day.

25:54.274 --> 25:56.789
And if you don't take it, well...

25:57.238 --> 25:58.815
you may end up just a vision

25:58.840 --> 26:01.286
in someone's drug-addled overdose.

26:03.180 --> 26:04.478
Overdose?

26:10.039 --> 26:12.174
- I didn't know she was your wife.
- You didn't know.

26:12.198 --> 26:13.704
You didn't know the first time.

26:13.728 --> 26:15.600
- How about after that, brother?
- Look, I tried, okay?

26:15.624 --> 26:16.839
I tried to stop.

26:16.863 --> 26:18.544
Yeah, so, you're saying
that she forced you?

26:18.568 --> 26:20.345
- No, I'm not. I'm...
- So, what?

26:20.370 --> 26:22.295
What, Gibson, huh?!

26:22.319 --> 26:23.547
What?!

26:23.571 --> 26:25.148
What, you were too weak?

26:25.172 --> 26:26.366
Too pathetic?

26:26.390 --> 26:28.696
Couldn't stand up to a lady?

26:28.720 --> 26:30.679
Or what's the matter, huh?

26:30.703 --> 26:32.280
Mama didn't love you?

26:43.409 --> 26:44.846
What is it?

26:44.870 --> 26:46.725
I don't know, but...

26:46.749 --> 26:50.135
n-none of this stuff looks like
it's part of a plane.

26:50.159 --> 26:52.292
Are there any tech campuses around here?

26:52.316 --> 26:55.318
Sure, bunch of math nerds
with food allergies.

26:55.342 --> 26:56.850
They work for that billionaire guy

26:56.874 --> 26:58.276
who wants to send people to Mars.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.808
Gibson?

27:03.832 --> 27:05.895
Gibson, do you copy?

27:05.919 --> 27:07.252
All right, please just talk to me, man.

27:07.276 --> 27:08.714
Gibson, Vasquez!

27:08.738 --> 27:10.313
- What do you want from me, huh?
- We're fine, Herrera.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.698
We don't need a babysitter.
You want me to hit you again?

27:11.723 --> 27:12.813
Is that it?

27:12.838 --> 27:14.275
You want me to beat the guilt out of you?

27:14.300 --> 27:15.946
I just want to know we can work together.

27:15.971 --> 27:17.269
What are you worried about, Gibson?

27:17.294 --> 27:18.836
That I'll leave you
in some burning building

27:18.861 --> 27:20.020
and yell "Clear"?

27:20.131 --> 27:21.395
It crossed my mind.

27:21.646 --> 27:24.126
As long as you're on my team,
I got your back,

27:24.414 --> 27:26.478
because that is the code I follow.

27:26.503 --> 27:29.506
And unlike some people, I honor my code.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.420
Jack, it's not an airplane.
It's a rocket.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.317
We need Hazmat.

27:40.342 --> 27:41.535
Vasquez, stand down!

27:41.560 --> 27:42.638
- Vasquez!
- This is Hazmat!

27:42.663 --> 27:43.776
That's not smoke!

27:43.800 --> 27:44.923
It's liquid oxygen!

27:44.947 --> 27:46.403
Hey! Get your hands off me!

27:57.267 --> 27:59.540
- Push them back!
- You okay?

27:59.862 --> 28:01.842
Let's get all these people out of here!

28:02.844 --> 28:04.734
I'll get Warren.

28:05.978 --> 28:09.224
Warren! Warren!

28:11.862 --> 28:13.439
Just breathe, okay?

28:14.891 --> 28:17.094
God, getting the knife-mobile.

28:17.119 --> 28:18.373
It's that bad, huh?

28:18.398 --> 28:20.566
All right, you're gonna be okay. Just...

28:20.591 --> 28:23.141
Just lie still and don't move.

28:23.166 --> 28:26.330
What's this? What's that I feel?

28:26.355 --> 28:27.513
- It's just blood.
- Is that my insides?

28:27.538 --> 28:28.837
It's just blood. Just take deep breaths.

28:28.862 --> 28:29.777
Eyes on me.

28:29.802 --> 28:30.971
On you?

28:30.996 --> 28:32.155
Right here.

28:32.180 --> 28:34.140
Hey, hey! Hey. Hey.

28:34.165 --> 28:36.471
I can't look at you.

28:36.608 --> 28:38.498
When I look at you, I see my wife.

28:38.523 --> 28:40.308
Rigo, hey, hey! Hey!

28:40.333 --> 28:42.779
Rigo... what do you want to do to me?

28:42.804 --> 28:45.349
I want to... I want to kill you.

28:45.374 --> 28:47.020
Good. Keep going. What else?

28:47.045 --> 28:48.831
I hate you.

28:48.856 --> 28:50.258
I always have hated you.

28:50.283 --> 28:52.868
What else? What else do you
want to do to me, huh?

28:52.893 --> 28:54.775
I... I want you to suffer.

28:55.051 --> 28:56.510
I want you to feel what I feel.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.112
Hey, hey, Rigo! Focus! Focus!

28:58.137 --> 28:59.574
Eyes on me! Hey!

28:59.599 --> 29:02.010
Hang on so you can smash in
the other side of my face.

29:02.035 --> 29:03.784
Son of a bitch.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.494
- What happened?
- This is what...

29:06.703 --> 29:08.063
Explosion. He's been eviscerated.

29:08.088 --> 29:09.998
I'm holding pressure
to keep the intestines in

29:10.023 --> 29:11.008
and bleeding.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.350
Ready?

29:14.375 --> 29:15.882
- 1... 2... 3.
- 2, 3.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.601
Down.

29:18.626 --> 29:21.246
Yeah, we got this, son.

29:27.152 --> 29:29.250
1, 2, 3.

29:35.214 --> 29:36.373
Please.

29:38.103 --> 29:39.177
Let's get him in the truck.

29:43.034 --> 29:45.723
Transporting Rigo Vasquez
to the PRT for immediate surgery.

29:45.748 --> 29:46.977
What happened?

29:47.002 --> 29:48.195
Penetrating injury to the abdomen.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.728
I'll know more once we open him up.

30:00.923 --> 30:02.534
Chief?

30:04.363 --> 30:06.845
There's a homeless guy out here
who won't leave.

30:10.062 --> 30:11.916
I really need you out here, Chief.

30:22.798 --> 30:23.783
We're losing him.

30:23.807 --> 30:25.140
This may sound crazy,

30:25.164 --> 30:27.646
but I need you to put your hand
in his abdomen.

30:27.670 --> 30:28.968
What?

30:28.992 --> 30:31.160
Insert your hand in his belly
as far as you can,

30:31.184 --> 30:32.550
until you can feel his spine.

30:32.574 --> 30:34.082
Uh...

30:41.753 --> 30:43.190
Good.

30:43.214 --> 30:46.287
Move your fingers to the right
just a tiny bit.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.270
Can you feel something pulsing?

30:48.294 --> 30:50.479
Yes. Barely.

30:50.504 --> 30:52.116
Okay, the tube is in.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.438
That's the aorta.

30:53.463 --> 30:55.075
I need you to press down on that
as hard as you can

30:55.100 --> 30:56.781
to stop the bleeding.

30:56.806 --> 30:58.904
We have a Hazmat situation here, Captain.

30:58.929 --> 30:59.885
- Call it in.
- What happened to Vasquez?

30:59.910 --> 31:01.208
Did you hear what I just said?

31:01.233 --> 31:02.496
Yes, and I want to know
why one of my people

31:02.521 --> 31:03.785
is bleeding on the PRT.

31:03.810 --> 31:05.351
This isn't from an aircraft.

31:05.376 --> 31:06.709
It's from a rocket explosion.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.591
Gibson warned Vasquez to stay
away. Vasquez didn't listen.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.271
- Gibson and Vasquez...
- Should never have been out here

31:10.296 --> 31:11.502
together.

31:11.527 --> 31:14.425
Now is not the time.
Call in Hazmat, or I will.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.434
I need a full Hazmat response
at Conifer Plaza.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.286
Have all units stage
west of the gas station.

31:22.154 --> 31:24.461
B.P.'s still dropping.

31:24.485 --> 31:26.758
Get me a REBOA catheter.

31:26.782 --> 31:28.184
We're gonna stop
the bleeding into his abdomen

31:28.208 --> 31:30.063
by blocking the blood from going there.

31:35.271 --> 31:37.543
Where is it? Naloxone, yes.

31:43.551 --> 31:44.593
Still falling.

31:45.201 --> 31:46.707
Almost there.

31:46.732 --> 31:48.135
I just need to measure

31:48.160 --> 31:49.772
to see how far we need
to put the balloon in

31:49.797 --> 31:52.208
to take the place of what your
finger is doing on the aorta.

31:56.723 --> 31:58.126
You know this kid?

31:58.151 --> 31:59.379
Yeah, he's one of mine.

31:59.404 --> 32:01.189
I recruited him out of junior college.

32:01.214 --> 32:02.641
I was there when his father passed.

32:02.666 --> 32:03.974
What's his name?

32:03.999 --> 32:05.227
Rigo.

32:05.252 --> 32:06.712
Come on.

32:07.850 --> 32:09.464
Okay.

32:09.489 --> 32:10.746
You can remove your hand from his belly.

32:15.551 --> 32:16.570
Still falling.

32:16.595 --> 32:17.719
Almost there.

32:17.744 --> 32:19.363
Almost there.

32:20.441 --> 32:23.052
Ben! It's coming up.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.458
Okay.

32:26.483 --> 32:27.607
Yeah. Now what?

32:27.632 --> 32:29.174
Now you drive.

32:41.426 --> 32:42.480
Come on, Dad.

32:44.141 --> 32:45.509
Ugh! Ripley!

32:45.534 --> 32:47.598
Um, no, sir, i-it's Emmett.

32:47.623 --> 32:49.826
Emmett Dixon.

32:49.851 --> 32:52.506
I'm pretty sure you O.D.'d, sir.

33:48.391 --> 33:49.515
He didn't listen.

33:49.539 --> 33:51.464
- Yeah, we know.
- And why is that?

33:51.488 --> 33:53.064
Because our Captain
put you out in the field

33:53.088 --> 33:55.256
with someone who recently
smashed your face in.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.647
That's my call. I stand by it.

33:56.671 --> 33:58.179
You stand by it?

33:58.203 --> 34:00.928
Vasquez could be dead right now,
and you stand by it?

34:00.952 --> 34:03.188
They said they could work together.

34:03.212 --> 34:04.684
But, Maya, you're the Captain.

34:04.708 --> 34:06.807
You decide who can work together,
not the other way around.

34:06.831 --> 34:08.847
- Herrera.
- Andy!

34:09.822 --> 34:10.911
This isn't her fault.

34:10.936 --> 34:13.034
Everything is the Captain's fault.

34:13.058 --> 34:14.947
Good or bad, that's the job.

34:14.972 --> 34:16.373
The job you wanted.

34:16.398 --> 34:18.079
The job you fought for. The job you took!

34:18.103 --> 34:20.552
That's right. It's the job I took.

34:20.576 --> 34:22.813
You have all been disrespectful
and insubordinate.

34:22.838 --> 34:23.928
You have questioned

34:23.952 --> 34:26.224
every single one of my decisions,

34:26.248 --> 34:28.590
which costs us lives and costs us time.

34:28.614 --> 34:31.755
You don't like that I'm your boss now?

34:31.779 --> 34:33.252
Request a transfer.

34:33.275 --> 34:35.199
But every single one of you
needs to get in line

34:35.224 --> 34:36.661
or get the hell out of my station.

34:36.685 --> 34:37.797
Are we clear?

34:40.853 --> 34:42.020
Yes, Captain.

34:42.043 --> 34:43.132
Yes, Captain.

34:43.156 --> 34:44.338
We're clear.

34:46.844 --> 34:49.777
Herrera, contact Rigo's wife.

34:49.802 --> 34:53.223
Gibson, try to get me an update.

34:53.246 --> 34:54.984
The rest of you, get back to work.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.664
It's my fault.

34:59.925 --> 35:01.628
Yeah, we know.

35:09.632 --> 35:11.521
This place runs on trust.

35:11.864 --> 35:15.347
And when trust is broken,
there are consequences.

35:16.952 --> 35:18.042
As you can see.

35:18.273 --> 35:19.432
Yes, sir.

35:19.457 --> 35:22.103
I have a prescription for the medication.

35:22.618 --> 35:25.982
One of the side effects is dizziness.

35:26.693 --> 35:27.734
Got it.

35:28.285 --> 35:29.721
Mm-hmm.

35:29.746 --> 35:33.271
I appreciate you coming to check on me.

35:33.734 --> 35:35.925
I'm lucky you found me when you did.

35:36.931 --> 35:38.828
Even if you were overly cautious.

35:41.695 --> 35:42.819
Anytime, sir.

35:42.844 --> 35:44.408
Dismissed.

35:50.845 --> 35:52.174
So, when are you gonna tell Avery

35:52.198 --> 35:53.913
- that you're squatting in his penthouse?
- Oh, I don't know.

35:53.937 --> 35:55.601
I was thinking maybe never,
'cause he's a doctor

35:55.625 --> 35:57.127
and he should have figured it out by now.

35:57.152 --> 35:58.137
Right?

35:58.162 --> 35:59.599
So glad I'm not straight.

35:59.624 --> 36:00.957
Shut up.

36:00.982 --> 36:02.337
Seriously, though, are you okay?

36:03.941 --> 36:06.039
Hey, man, how was your first day?

36:06.064 --> 36:08.650
Uh, yeah, interesting.

36:08.675 --> 36:10.773
I, uh, had a homeless guy walk in

36:10.798 --> 36:12.931
and kind of just camp out.

36:12.956 --> 36:14.741
Hmm. Just like you're doing at Jackson's.

36:14.766 --> 36:16.760
Oh, wait, was it Joe?

36:16.785 --> 36:18.605
- Yeah, Joe.
- Yeah, he's a regular.

36:18.630 --> 36:20.485
He comes in when the trucks pull out.

36:20.510 --> 36:21.495
Right.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.349
So, uh, Sullivan, he's, uh...

36:24.374 --> 36:25.642
He's a lot.

36:25.667 --> 36:27.348
- He's a lot.
- Oh, he's intense. Yeah.

36:27.373 --> 36:29.298
Yeah. Definitely intense.

36:29.323 --> 36:30.647
Yeah. Oh!

36:30.672 --> 36:32.074
You know what? Wait.

36:32.099 --> 36:33.900
Travis, you should tell Probie

36:33.925 --> 36:35.501
about when Sullivan
stopped talking to you

36:35.526 --> 36:37.055
'cause you got that weird haircut.

36:40.634 --> 36:42.441
Didn't tell me you were a firefighter.

36:44.344 --> 36:45.921
You didn't ask.

36:51.154 --> 36:52.330
Hi.

36:53.093 --> 36:55.041
What are you doing here?

36:55.066 --> 36:56.851
I saw Warren at the hospital,

36:56.876 --> 36:58.765
and he said it was a tough day,

36:58.790 --> 37:01.433
so I brought you lasagne.

37:02.736 --> 37:04.590
You can't just come to my work.

37:04.615 --> 37:06.714
- W-Warren just said I...
- Carina, you're hot,

37:06.751 --> 37:07.875
but all we did was hook up.

37:07.900 --> 37:09.335
I don't need a girlfriend.

37:10.384 --> 37:11.438
Wow.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.970
Okay. Um...

37:14.422 --> 37:16.384
My apologies.

37:17.015 --> 37:18.788
It was nice meeting you, then.

37:23.363 --> 37:25.392
I'm sorry.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.472
I'm...

37:26.497 --> 37:27.552
Rude?

37:27.577 --> 37:29.070
Broken?

37:29.990 --> 37:33.027
I'm not in the habit
of fixing broken people,

37:33.051 --> 37:34.802
so...

37:34.826 --> 37:36.807
I understand.

37:54.944 --> 37:56.834
The lasagne smells almost as good as you.

37:56.858 --> 37:58.260
Does it?

38:04.895 --> 38:06.924
Hey, I need to talk to you.

38:06.948 --> 38:08.037
Vasquez?

38:08.061 --> 38:09.220
No, no.

38:09.244 --> 38:10.751
No word on Vasquez yet.

38:10.775 --> 38:12.003
I, uh...

38:12.027 --> 38:14.439
There's something I-I need to say to you.

38:17.524 --> 38:19.692
Why is it so hard for you?

38:20.073 --> 38:21.397
What?

38:21.421 --> 38:23.158
The truth.

38:24.067 --> 38:26.235
That you gave my promotion to Maya

38:26.259 --> 38:27.593
because you knew about my dad.

38:27.617 --> 38:28.984
And you kept it from me,

38:29.008 --> 38:32.485
which makes you a bad boss
and a worse friend.

38:32.509 --> 38:34.781
Yep, I did do all of that.

38:37.588 --> 38:38.782
Andy, I'm in trouble.

38:39.988 --> 38:42.366
And I don't know who else
to talk to about it.

38:42.390 --> 38:44.139
But you are who I want to talk to,

38:44.163 --> 38:45.601
because I'm in love with you.

38:48.582 --> 38:50.367
And I've been in love with you...

38:50.391 --> 38:52.560
feels like forever.

38:52.584 --> 38:54.616
And I'm failing at it.

38:56.341 --> 38:58.926
I'm failing at loving you.

38:58.950 --> 39:00.214
I'm failing at protecting you.

39:00.238 --> 39:01.814
I'm failing at being your boss.

39:01.838 --> 39:03.415
I'm failing at being your friend.

39:03.439 --> 39:05.036
I'm...

39:06.224 --> 39:08.149
I'm sorry.

39:08.174 --> 39:10.272
And I... And I want to talk.

39:10.297 --> 39:13.648
Can we... talk?

39:17.040 --> 39:20.147
I can't be angry at my dad,
because he is dying.

39:20.172 --> 39:22.097
But you're perfectly healthy.

39:30.432 --> 39:33.261
What we're gonna
do is just sauté the spinach first.

39:33.286 --> 39:36.219
You want to probably add
half a shallot in there.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.248
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

39:39.273 --> 39:41.010
Sorry I woke you. Go back to sleep.

39:44.588 --> 39:46.443
Sorry about before, okay?

39:46.468 --> 39:47.975
I was just tired.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.506
- We're both...
- It's okay.

39:49.531 --> 39:52.048
No, I know you've been
cooped up in here all week.

39:52.073 --> 39:54.936
If you want, we can take TBD
to the park or something.

39:54.961 --> 39:57.181
I was reading earlier
that it's really important,

39:57.206 --> 39:58.191
these first couple months,

39:58.216 --> 39:59.584
to stimulate the baby's senses...

39:59.609 --> 40:01.986
Keep reading and watching.

40:02.011 --> 40:04.561
W-What are you doing?

40:04.586 --> 40:06.128
Leaving.

40:07.198 --> 40:08.426
You're leaving with the baby?

40:10.853 --> 40:12.347
No.

40:13.384 --> 40:15.344
Wait, you're leaving us?

40:15.369 --> 40:16.875
You're... You're gonna leave her?

40:18.954 --> 40:20.183
Hey, okay.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.924
Hey, look, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

40:21.949 --> 40:23.421
I-I-I, uh...

40:23.446 --> 40:25.127
I think this is just... just hormones.

40:25.152 --> 40:26.797
I didn't mean anything I-I said before.

40:26.822 --> 40:28.469
I was never planning to stay.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.618
I wanted her to know you,

40:31.643 --> 40:33.846
and I wanted to give you the choice.

40:34.415 --> 40:36.292
You can give her up for adoption
if you want,

40:36.317 --> 40:38.185
but I don't think you will,

40:38.210 --> 40:39.786
'cause you're such a good guy.

40:41.381 --> 40:43.654
Look, you are gonna be such a good dad.

40:45.211 --> 40:46.856
You're way more cut out
for this than I am.

40:46.881 --> 40:48.005
I'm not.

40:48.030 --> 40:49.153
I'm... Hey, I'm really not.

40:49.177 --> 40:50.614
I-I-I can't do this.

40:50.638 --> 40:52.527
- Hey, tell her I love her.
- JJ, you can't...

40:52.551 --> 40:55.573
Tell her I know myself too well.

40:55.597 --> 40:57.805
Look, I won't be a good mom.

40:57.829 --> 40:59.285
JJ.

40:59.316 --> 41:01.324
Tell her to look me up
when she's 16 or 17

41:01.349 --> 41:02.578
if she wants,

41:02.603 --> 41:04.701
because I can hang with a teenager,

41:04.726 --> 41:06.998
but not a baby.

41:07.023 --> 41:08.808
Please. Hey, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.539
Just for a second, just wait.

41:11.564 --> 41:13.697
Okay?

41:13.722 --> 41:15.194
I've seen you with her.

41:15.219 --> 41:16.969
I see the way you... you look at her.

41:16.994 --> 41:18.188
Your face lights up.

41:18.213 --> 41:20.868
Everyone's face lights up
when they look at babies.

41:20.893 --> 41:23.506
I am not a mother.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.533
Look, you don't want me in her life,
trust me.

41:25.558 --> 41:27.018
Please.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.943
Give her a good name, Dean.

41:30.825 --> 41:32.933
And give her a good life.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.267
Hey...

41:42.745 --> 41:44.078
I'm...

41:44.103 --> 41:46.201
I'm coming. I'm coming.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.545
Hey.

41:52.810 --> 41:54.595
Hey.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.581
Hey.
