00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:03.938 --> 00:06.005
<i> (theme song playing)</i>

00:08.476 --> 00:11.677
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:11.679 --> 00:14.513
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:20.285
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>

00:20.287 --> 00:23.188
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:28.327

00:28.329 --> 00:30.896
<i> ¶ I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:37.069
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:44.943
(sniffs)

00:47.548 --> 00:48.647
(sniffs)

00:50.317 --> 00:51.350
(thunder rumbling)

00:51.352 --> 00:53.152
(cawing)

00:57.258 --> 00:59.358
-(thunder rumbling)
-Hmm.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.726
(cawing)

01:01.829 --> 01:03.629
(girl giggling)

01:04.765 --> 01:06.065
(screams)

01:09.336 --> 01:11.937
(laughing)

01:11.939 --> 01:13.572
What do we do, Quirin?

01:13.574 --> 01:16.542
My home!
These rocks are destroying
everything in their path!

01:16.544 --> 01:18.744
(indistinct muttering)

01:18.746 --> 01:20.379
Take ease, friends.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.448
Our situation
may seem dire,

01:22.450 --> 01:24.583
but we mustn't lose hope.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.018
But, what are they?

01:26.020 --> 01:27.553
Where are they
coming from?

01:27.555 --> 01:30.089
I've been studying these rocks
and I think I discovered

01:30.091 --> 01:32.458
a vulnerability
in their alchemical make-up.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.026
Son, I told you,

01:34.028 --> 01:36.028
leave those rocks alone.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.597
Yeah, I know, I know, I know,
but something has to be done

01:38.599 --> 01:40.365
and I think I may
be onto a solution!

01:40.367 --> 01:42.367
Something is being done.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.570
In fact, I plan
to travel to see the king

01:44.572 --> 01:46.772
this afternoon
about this very matter.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.742
Oh. Well, um, then can--
can I come with you?

01:50.744 --> 01:52.911
(sighs)

01:52.913 --> 01:55.547
Very well.
You can travel with me.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.582
Really?

01:56.584 --> 01:59.084
Yes! Yes!
Road trip!

01:59.086 --> 02:01.787
Varian and Dad
going to see the king!

02:01.789 --> 02:02.988
(chuckles)

02:02.990 --> 02:05.591
I will pack
ham sandwiches.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.559
(chuckles) Yes.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.063
In the meantime,
stay away from those rocks.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.565
Uh, okay, but, um...

02:13.567 --> 02:15.734
that's getting harder
to do by the minute.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.442
Your Majesty.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.910
Ever since
you repaved the roads,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.812
wear and tear
on people's shoes

02:26.814 --> 02:28.614
-(yawns)
-are at an all-time low!

02:28.616 --> 02:31.617
Not one person has come
into the cobbler shop all week!

02:31.619 --> 02:33.485
I see.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.021
Well, we can't
very well unpave the roads,

02:36.023 --> 02:37.222
can we, Feldspar?

02:38.626 --> 02:39.992
However, it occurs to me

02:39.994 --> 02:42.961
that the royal guard
is in need of new boots.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.497
Do you think
you might be of service, sir?

02:45.499 --> 02:49.501
Might-- Might I?
Why, of course, Your Majesty.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.872
(whispering)
Do the guards really
need new boots?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.507
Uh, no.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.644
But the livelihood
of our local businesses
is worth the extra cost.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.045
-(squeaks)
-Wow.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.014
I have learned so much

03:02.016 --> 03:04.516
from shadowing you
these last few days!

03:04.518 --> 03:06.518
Good. Because
you must be prepared

03:06.520 --> 03:08.187
for any contingency
while we're gone.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.690
Uh, Frederic, we're going
to be away for two days.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.858
We deserve a little break.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.660
I think she can manage.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.961
Oh, I know she can.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.696
After witnessing
the supreme judgment

03:17.698 --> 03:19.731
she exercised
while defending Attila,

03:19.733 --> 03:21.733
there's not a doubt
in my mind.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.570
But that doesn't mean
a father can't worry.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.679
What are you doing?

03:33.681 --> 03:35.647
Since Rapunzel
is pretty much

03:35.649 --> 03:36.982
the queen
for a couple days,

03:36.984 --> 03:39.551
that makes me
pretty much the king.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.887
Pray tell, Your Majesty,
what hast thou planned to do

03:41.889 --> 03:44.089
with thine newly
bestowed might?

03:44.091 --> 03:46.592
Ha ha! Well, I thought
you'd never ask.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.027
I figured I'd start small.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.829
You know, take a dip
in the royal pool,

03:50.831 --> 03:52.564
try on that furry
cape-y thing,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.166
take a little snooze
on the throne.

03:54.168 --> 03:56.034
And then from there,
I can move on to bigger stuff.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.071
You know, make a few decrees,
negotiate an accord,

03:59.073 --> 04:00.172
proclamate a...

04:01.775 --> 04:03.709
proclamating thing.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.711
You're outta your head.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.747
"You're out of your head,
Your Majesty."

04:08.749 --> 04:12.184
(laughing)

04:12.186 --> 04:14.253
"Your Majesty."

04:15.723 --> 04:17.556
Okay, Dad,
what's our strategy?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.625
I mean, I tried to get a sample
of the rocks to show the King,

04:19.627 --> 04:20.759
-but they just won't cut--
-Son.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.861
Wait here while
I speak to the king.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.763
Dad, I think
I should go in there

04:24.765 --> 04:25.964
to help explain
the scientific--

04:25.966 --> 04:27.232
Varian.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.735
Children have
no place in court.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.204
But I-- I'm not a--

04:34.808 --> 04:36.775
Quirin, my old friend.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.877
What brings you
from Old Corona Village?

04:38.879 --> 04:43.815
Your Majesty, Old Corona
is facing quite the dilemma.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.751
-Oh?
-Uh, yes.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.953
It would appear
this year's harvest

04:47.955 --> 04:49.888
has proven quite bountiful!

04:49.890 --> 04:52.557
So much so, that I
humbly request more land

04:52.559 --> 04:54.760
to accommodate such bounty!

04:54.762 --> 04:55.827
What?

04:57.164 --> 04:58.897
Your Majesty.

04:58.899 --> 05:03.135
We've received no such
crop reports from Old Corona.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.003
Hmm.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.140
Quirin,

05:08.142 --> 05:11.777
I am pleased to hear
how well Old Corona is faring

05:11.779 --> 05:14.746
and even more pleased
to grant your request.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.317
Thank you, Your Majesty.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.824
Dad! None of that was true!

05:25.826 --> 05:27.859
Wha-- Old Corona's
being destroyed!

05:27.861 --> 05:29.828
Old Corona will endure.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.998
You'll have to trust
that I can handle this.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.033
How? How can I trust anything

05:35.035 --> 05:38.003
when my own father
just lied to the king's face?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.905
That is enough, Varian.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.007
Yes, sir.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.717
Varian?
Is everything okay?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.385
No! No, it's not.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.121
Rapunzel, we came
to see your dad

05:56.123 --> 05:57.956
about the rocks
in Old Corona.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.725
Yeah, but your dad
just said--

05:59.727 --> 06:00.959
My dad lied.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.694
Things have gotten worse.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.062
How much worse?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.899
(dramatic music plays)

06:10.838 --> 06:12.104
A lot worse.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.339
Don't worry, Varian.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.007
I haven't forgotten
our agreement.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.342
We're gonna figure out
the mystery

06:17.344 --> 06:20.011
behind these rocks.
Together.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.013
Just give me
until my father returns.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.316
Everything is gonna be okay.

06:24.318 --> 06:25.817
I promise.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.160
We hope to make it
to the mountain retreat by noon.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.662
I am so excited
for you guys!

06:39.266 --> 06:41.066
Take good care of them, Max.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.367
(nickers)

06:42.369 --> 06:44.002
(squeaks)

06:44.004 --> 06:46.004
You two kids have fun now.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.773
(laughing)

06:50.244 --> 06:52.277
Are you sure
you'll be okay, Rapunzel?

06:52.279 --> 06:54.846
Because your mom
and I can always stay.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.015
We have plenty
of anniversaries
to come, you know.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.050
-Frederic.
-Lance: Don't worry,
Your Majesty.

06:59.052 --> 07:02.287
We've totally got
everything under control.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.625
Er, thank you... you.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.360
That's comforting.

07:08.362 --> 07:11.029
I'm sorry.
Are those my shoes?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.166
(chuckles nervously)

07:16.203 --> 07:20.038
Hmm! I won't
let you down, Dad.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.373
I know you won't, sweetie.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.910
Now remember,
you'll discover
when you become queen,

07:24.912 --> 07:27.078
many voices
will demand to be heard,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.080
but when all is said and done,

07:29.082 --> 07:31.049
the voice in your heart
is the one you should follow.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.900
Kitchen raid!

07:48.902 --> 07:51.236
-(cheering)
-(growls)

07:51.238 --> 07:53.104
Hey, hey, hey, Cassandra,
make good choices!

07:53.106 --> 07:54.306
Make good choices!

07:55.976 --> 07:57.843
(exhales deeply)

07:57.845 --> 08:00.078
(bell ringing)

08:00.080 --> 08:02.848
So whatta we got, Nigel?

08:02.850 --> 08:04.449
Well, first...

08:04.451 --> 08:07.118
there's this morning's
royal counsel

08:07.120 --> 08:09.421
to hear out
your subjects' concerns.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.761
All right, people of Corona!
Got a problem?

08:16.763 --> 08:19.831
-Consider it solved!
-(squeaks)

08:21.301 --> 08:22.367
Wow. (nervous laugh)

08:22.369 --> 08:25.437
Little longer
than yesterday, right?

08:25.439 --> 08:27.272
But nothing I can't handle.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.207
Actually, Princess,
word got out

08:29.209 --> 08:31.276
that you would be
receiving subjects,

08:31.278 --> 08:33.278
and well...

08:33.280 --> 08:35.213
we have quite a turn out.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.187
I have made the good king
aware of our problem,

08:42.189 --> 08:44.322
and we have his blessings.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.391
(indistinct chatter)

08:53.834 --> 08:55.233
(sighs)

08:55.235 --> 08:56.801
(chittering)

09:00.173 --> 09:02.040
Running away isn't going
to fix the problem.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.675
These rocks must be stopped.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.311
Okay, Rudiger, so what
do we know about them?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.345
They're unbreakable,

09:07.347 --> 09:09.180
they're somehow
connected to the princess,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.316
and... (shouting)

09:11.318 --> 09:14.819
worse yet, they are growing
at an exponential rate.

09:14.821 --> 09:15.921
Within a matter of months,

09:15.923 --> 09:17.889
they will have reached
the castle.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.425
(Rudiger chittering)

09:20.427 --> 09:22.060
(sighs)

09:22.062 --> 09:25.230
Now... physical force has
no effect on these rocks,

09:25.232 --> 09:26.831
but they have yet to reckon

09:26.833 --> 09:29.267
with the awesome power
of alchemy!

09:46.086 --> 09:47.452
Yow! Whoa! Oh!

09:47.454 --> 09:50.855
-Uh...
-Quirin: Varian! Son,
are you okay in there?

09:50.857 --> 09:52.123
Yes, Dad! Yes, yes!

09:52.125 --> 09:54.759
-I just dropped a book.
-(explosion)

09:54.761 --> 09:57.495
One of my--
one of my big boo-books.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.439
Good. Now, don't forget
the trim on the left.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.208
Really taking advantage
of that king clout,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.577
aren't we, Your Majesty?

10:12.579 --> 10:15.814
Blondie asked me to do
a check-in on the renovations

10:15.816 --> 10:17.515
as part of her queenly duties.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.952
It's an important job.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.554
(groans)

10:22.556 --> 10:24.789
Sorry, buddy! My bad!

10:24.791 --> 10:26.524
It's good to be
the king, huh?

10:29.830 --> 10:32.163
Okay. You wanna see me
flex a little muscle?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.799
Watch this.
Alright, boys!
Let's get the lead out.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.134
After we wrap this up,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.436
I'm gonna need some
renovations to my room.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.972
I'm thinking sunroof. Oh!

10:40.974 --> 10:43.475
Hook Foot:
Just for the record,
that one was on purpose!

10:43.477 --> 10:46.277
Mm-hmm.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.513
There's still a lot to go.
Sure you can handle it?

10:48.515 --> 10:50.515
Yeah! Of course, I can.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.150
(chuckles)

10:52.152 --> 10:53.318
Come on!

10:53.320 --> 10:55.487
¶ Royal decision making ¶

10:55.489 --> 10:57.822
¶ Hey, I was born to do it ¶

10:57.824 --> 10:59.924
¶ Yeah, sure,
I'm slightly faking ¶

10:59.926 --> 11:02.160
¶ But there's not
that much to it ¶

11:02.162 --> 11:03.428
¶ Bring it on, I'm ready ¶

11:03.430 --> 11:05.597
¶ 'Cause I got this ¶

11:05.599 --> 11:07.666
¶ I've got this ¶

11:07.668 --> 11:09.934
¶ Just watch ¶

11:11.204 --> 11:13.171
Princess Rapunzel,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.173
may I present...

11:15.175 --> 11:18.543
your most humble subjects.

11:18.545 --> 11:22.447
¶ He wont let my sheep graze
next to his without a fight ¶

11:22.449 --> 11:24.382
-Hmm.
-¶ How can I cut hair ¶

11:24.384 --> 11:26.685
¶ With this guy fiddling
day and night? ¶

11:26.687 --> 11:29.020
-Gosh.
-¶ Lately, half the city's ¶

11:29.022 --> 11:31.356
¶ Overrun by cats and kitties ¶

11:31.358 --> 11:34.626
-(mews)
-¶ Eating everything in sight ¶

11:34.628 --> 11:35.894
Right.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.395
¶ Past your land is public ¶

11:37.397 --> 11:40.231
¶ I decree
you'll have to share ¶

11:40.233 --> 11:41.800
¶ Ear plugs will do wonders ¶

11:41.802 --> 11:43.902
¶ You'll receive a royal pair ¶

11:43.904 --> 11:45.970
-Thanks!
-¶ Henceforth, it is written ¶

11:45.972 --> 11:48.640
¶ We'll feed every
cat and kitten ¶

11:48.642 --> 11:51.743
¶ Here within
the palace square ¶

11:51.745 --> 11:53.078
-Fair?
-Yeah!

11:53.080 --> 11:54.979
¶ Folks, the line starts there ¶

11:54.981 --> 11:57.482
¶ She's got a knack
for reigning ¶

11:57.484 --> 11:59.317
¶ So far, she's holding steady ¶

11:59.319 --> 12:01.586
¶ But folks are still
complaining ¶

12:01.588 --> 12:03.755
¶ So let's not throw confetti ¶

12:03.757 --> 12:07.058
¶ Nonetheless, I guess
our girl has got this ¶

12:07.060 --> 12:09.327
¶ She's got this ¶

12:09.329 --> 12:11.429
¶ No prob ¶

12:12.866 --> 12:14.265
Is that the last one?

12:15.268 --> 12:18.103
Well... not exactly...

12:18.105 --> 12:19.304
Your Highness!

12:20.340 --> 12:22.107
¶ Since we shared the pasture ¶

12:22.109 --> 12:24.109
¶ We can't tell whose sheep
are whose ¶

12:24.111 --> 12:26.711
-Oops.
-¶ I can't hear my customers ¶

12:26.713 --> 12:29.047
-¶ And ruin all their dos ¶
-Sorry.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.715
¶ Now the cats are quiet ¶

12:30.717 --> 12:33.284
¶ But the rats
are running riot ¶

12:33.286 --> 12:35.787
¶ Up and down the avenues ¶

12:35.789 --> 12:37.355
(people grumbling)

12:37.357 --> 12:39.791
¶ No more interviews ¶

12:45.098 --> 12:47.699
¶ Gosh, what a huge disaster ¶

12:47.701 --> 12:50.435
¶ And everybody knew it ¶

12:50.437 --> 12:53.471
¶ I had one job to master ¶

12:53.473 --> 12:56.207
¶ And I completely blew it ¶

12:56.209 --> 12:59.978
¶ I was so darn certain
that I got this ¶

12:59.980 --> 13:02.614
¶ But I'm not this ¶

13:02.616 --> 13:06.151
¶ Not yet ¶

13:06.153 --> 13:09.788
¶ Who would have thought
how far from getting this ¶

13:09.790 --> 13:15.326
¶ I could get ¶

13:21.735 --> 13:23.835
So, how was your
first day on the job?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.005
Whoa. Is everything okay?

13:27.007 --> 13:29.607
(sighs) I'm just...

13:29.609 --> 13:31.075
(groans)

13:31.077 --> 13:32.610
How am I ever gonna do this?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.579
Hey, hey, relax.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.447
You only gotta hang
in there one more day.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.949
Your parents
will be back soon.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.818
(scoffs) I know.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.452
But...

13:41.454 --> 13:44.155
Mmm. It's not tomorrow
I'm worried about.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.456
Someday...

13:45.458 --> 13:47.592
this is gonna be
my job every day,

13:47.594 --> 13:49.093
and I'm... (sighs)

13:49.095 --> 13:51.162
I-I'm not sure
I can handle it all.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.264
Blondie, come on.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.966
Look at all the amazing
things you've done

13:54.968 --> 13:56.334
since leaving that tower.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.436
Do you think you would've
been able to do any of them

13:58.438 --> 13:59.604
if you'd stopped
to worry about

13:59.606 --> 14:00.939
how you were
going to do it?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.440
I know you didn't choose this,

14:02.442 --> 14:03.875
but you of all people
should know

14:03.877 --> 14:05.610
that when life
hands you lemons...

14:06.546 --> 14:08.980
Yes? Finish that thought.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.682
Oh! Well.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.151
Uh, no, it's not so much
a thought as much
as an expression.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.153
Because you can do
a lot with lemons.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.455
Make lemon meringue.
Soften your hair.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.390
Clean tough stains.
Juggle.

14:19.392 --> 14:23.161
-Or make lemonade?
-You know, not a fan.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.963
Okay. My point is that you,

14:24.965 --> 14:26.664
more than anyone
I've ever known,

14:26.666 --> 14:28.299
are able to take
any situation

14:28.301 --> 14:29.367
and make the best of it.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.569
You're the queen.
Go with it.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.706
Ugh! Snow?

14:34.708 --> 14:37.508
Oh my gosh!
(laughs softly)

14:37.510 --> 14:40.979
I've never actually been
outside when it snows!

14:40.981 --> 14:43.348
Well, I have
and you know,
I'm not a fan.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.350
I mean, it's cold,
it's a pain,

14:45.352 --> 14:46.684
it ruins your day.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.587
It's like Cassandra,
but warmer.

14:50.857 --> 14:51.990
(gasps)

14:51.992 --> 14:53.391
Hey, where you going?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.493
To enjoy life's lemons!

14:55.495 --> 14:57.028
That's my girl.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.496
(wind whistles)

14:58.498 --> 14:59.898
(shudders)

14:59.900 --> 15:01.833
I hate the snow.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.342
(nickers)

15:20.620 --> 15:21.953
Wow.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.055
Oh, it's beautiful.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.691
I don't recall the last time
it snowed this much.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.627
Hmm. Looks like
there's more to come.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.363
I don't know, Arianna,
maybe we should
return to the castle.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.600
Hmm, Frederic, I know
you're worried about Rapunzel.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.470
(neighs)

15:39.472 --> 15:41.306
But she's going to be--

15:50.150 --> 15:51.382
-(gasps)
-Arianna!

15:51.384 --> 15:53.818
Frederic! (gasps)

15:53.820 --> 15:55.887
Frederic.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.590
Oh. Oh.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.292
(whinnying)

16:03.129 --> 16:04.395
(gasps)

16:24.818 --> 16:26.517
Hmm.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.897
(sighs)

16:46.006 --> 16:48.339
(chuckles)

16:50.010 --> 16:51.509
Never give up, Rudiger.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.211
So, our last formula
didn't deliver

16:53.213 --> 16:54.846
quite the reaction
we'd hoped.

16:54.848 --> 16:55.980
(chitters)

16:55.982 --> 16:57.382
So, what?

16:57.384 --> 17:00.985
The important thing is
we got a reaction.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.120
-Son.
-(chitters)

17:02.122 --> 17:04.722
-Quirin: I just want to--
-Oh! Oh!

17:04.724 --> 17:08.393
Varian, I told you
to stay away from those rocks!

17:08.395 --> 17:10.661
Um, yeah, okay. I-I know
what you said, but--

17:10.663 --> 17:14.399
Then there should be
no misunderstanding!

17:14.401 --> 17:16.868
-Now listen to me. You--
-No!

17:16.870 --> 17:18.636
No, you listen to me, Dad.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.471
Our village is dying.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.640
You think running
away from the problem
is gonna fix it?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.642
No! These rocks
aren't going away.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.310
I know, Varian,

17:26.312 --> 17:29.881
but there is more to them
than you can possibly imagine.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.649
Then why
won't you tell me?

17:31.651 --> 17:34.052
Dad! I just--
I deserve to know.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.893
I am sorry, son.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.594
You are not ready.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.931
Varian, watch out!

17:53.840 --> 17:56.007
Oh! Dad! Dad!

17:56.009 --> 17:58.376
Oh! Hold on, Dad. Hold on.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.744
I'll-- I'll get you out.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.480
No! Stay back.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.383
(gasping)

18:05.385 --> 18:06.617
I'm gonna go get help.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.419
No, son. Don't.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.155
(panting)

18:16.763 --> 18:19.097
Loyal subjects of Corona,

18:19.099 --> 18:20.965
as your temporary queen,

18:20.967 --> 18:24.535
I officially declare today...

18:24.537 --> 18:26.604
a snow day!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.639
(crowd cheering)

18:32.579 --> 18:35.947
And as your temporary king, I...

18:41.821 --> 18:42.954
(giggling)

18:42.956 --> 18:45.623
(sarcastically chuckles)

18:45.625 --> 18:47.959
-Nice shot, kid.
-(laughs)

18:47.961 --> 18:49.660
Alright. Easy.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.896
One step at a time.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.631
Whoo!

18:53.633 --> 18:55.433
Woo-hoo!
Pick it up, Eugene!

18:55.435 --> 18:58.603
(stammering)

18:58.605 --> 19:00.605
(groans)

19:00.607 --> 19:02.840
Oh, is there anything
worse than snow?

19:02.842 --> 19:04.909
Hello, your royal travesty.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.511
I spoke too soon.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.578
Playing make-believe King

19:07.580 --> 19:09.814
isn't panning out like
you'd hoped, is it, Tiger?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.916
It's working out
just fine. Thanks.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.985
(grunts, groans)

19:16.689 --> 19:18.523
You know, it's not like
this king thing

19:18.525 --> 19:20.158
gives you
any actual power.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.692
But even if it did,
it might be nice

19:21.694 --> 19:23.027
to stop trying
to exploit it

19:23.029 --> 19:24.929
and start trying
to put it good use.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.599
(muffled)
Yeah, no, that's okay.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.934
Don't help me up.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.937
(giggling)

19:32.939 --> 19:34.505
Whoa!

19:34.507 --> 19:36.707
Oh! Thanks, Eugene.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.676
Guess I'm still getting
used to this weather.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.811
Does it always
snow this much?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.513
Xavier:
Only once.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.616
At least, according to legend.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.718
Legend?

19:48.955 --> 19:52.123
The Legend of Xan Tiri.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.560
Eons ago,

19:55.562 --> 19:58.162
an evil warlock, Xan Tiri,

19:58.164 --> 20:00.731
<i> had a deep hatred</i>
<i> for Corona.</i>

20:00.733 --> 20:02.667
<i> And cast a spell</i>

20:02.669 --> 20:07.805
<i> which caused a blizzard</i>
<i> to sweep across the land.</i>

20:07.807 --> 20:11.676
<i> The storm destroyed</i>
<i> everything in its path.</i>

20:11.678 --> 20:13.678
<i> All would have been lost,</i>

20:13.680 --> 20:16.514
<i> had it not been</i>
<i> for the ancient engineer,</i>

20:16.516 --> 20:19.650
<i> and inventor, Lord Demanitus.</i>

20:19.652 --> 20:21.986
<i> Using both magic and science,</i>

20:21.988 --> 20:25.923
<i> Demanitus built a massive</i>
<i> subterranean machine,</i>

20:25.925 --> 20:27.692
<i> deep in the Corona mountains.</i>

20:27.694 --> 20:30.161
<i> This mighty device</i>
<i> had the ability</i>

20:30.163 --> 20:33.030
<i> to change the direction</i>
<i> of the wind,</i>

20:33.032 --> 20:36.300
<i> and it pushed the flurries</i>
<i> out to the sea.</i>

20:38.705 --> 20:41.105
<i> The day was saved.</i>

20:41.107 --> 20:44.742
<i> Xan Tiri had, indeed,</i>
<i> been defeated.</i>

20:44.744 --> 20:47.945
But some say the curse
of the storm lives on

20:47.947 --> 20:52.850
and is simply waiting
to strike again.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.752
Waiting? For what?

20:54.754 --> 20:57.955
For Corona to be
at its weakest.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.092
"For Corona to be
at its weakest."

21:01.094 --> 21:05.630
But it is only a legend,
right, Xavier?

21:05.632 --> 21:06.864
(Xavier chuckles)

21:06.866 --> 21:10.801
My dear, every legend
is born of truth.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.772
(slow claps)

21:14.774 --> 21:16.907
Bravo! Wow!

21:16.909 --> 21:19.810
Way to keep the party going
as always, Xavier.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.580
(wind whistles)

21:22.582 --> 21:24.815
Rapunzel:
Whoa!

21:24.817 --> 21:27.785
Okay, um, I think
for everyone's safety,

21:27.787 --> 21:29.954
we should all head indoors.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.859
(Maximus neighs)

21:43.836 --> 21:45.903
-(sighs)
-Maximus!

21:46.906 --> 21:48.906
What happened?
Are you okay?

21:48.908 --> 21:50.274
And where--

21:50.276 --> 21:51.876
Maximus, where
are my parents?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.179
(nickers sadly)

21:55.181 --> 21:56.747
It looks like
there was an accident

21:56.749 --> 21:58.049
up on the mountain.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.851
-Accident?
-Rapunzel.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.821
I think your parents
are in grave danger.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.695
(wind whistling)

22:16.803 --> 22:18.903
-(coughing)
-(baby crying)

22:28.014 --> 22:30.815
Nigel, I need to go look
for my parents.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.283
But Your Highness...

22:32.285 --> 22:33.951
you're the queen!

22:33.953 --> 22:35.686
You can't just
leave your kingdom

22:35.688 --> 22:37.121
in its darkest hour.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.024
Oh, Rapunzel, as much
as it pains me to say this,

22:40.026 --> 22:41.826
their chances in elements
such as these

22:41.828 --> 22:43.994
are-- oh, well.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.130
Let's pray your parents
found shelter

22:46.132 --> 22:47.998
before the worst
of the storm hit.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.167
But we can't just
let them freeze!

22:50.169 --> 22:52.236
My dear, going out
in that weather now

22:52.238 --> 22:54.038
is a virtual
death sentence.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.840
You cannot go!

22:55.842 --> 22:57.074
-(door opens)
-Eugene: He's right, Rapunzel.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.744
You can't... but we can.

22:59.746 --> 23:03.147
But you just heard Nigel.
It's a death trap.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.081
Look at us, Princess.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.217
If the rest of the world
had its way,

23:06.219 --> 23:09.820
each and every one of us
would either be on the run

23:09.822 --> 23:10.921
or locked up somewhere.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.056
But your parents
had the heart

23:12.058 --> 23:13.891
to give us
a second chance.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.026
A chance
to prove ourselves

23:16.028 --> 23:17.061
and go straight.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.662
The least we can do

23:18.664 --> 23:21.198
is give them
a second chance
of their own.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.099
Eugene:
Listen to them.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.668
Rapunzel, there's
no other option.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.837
The mountains made
for a great hideout
back in the day.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.239
I know those roads
better than anyone.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.674
Face it. We're the
men for this job.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.010
Besides, even a
make-believe king

23:33.012 --> 23:35.880
has gotta make
himself useful.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.749
Your Highness, the guards
should really be the ones to go.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.951
If this storm keeps up,
things could get ugly,

23:40.953 --> 23:43.220
and this kingdom
will need its guards.

23:43.222 --> 23:45.189
Your Highness,
it's your call.

23:49.362 --> 23:51.862
(sighs) Go.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.067
We'll be back.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.102
I promise.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.212
(whinnies)

24:08.214 --> 24:09.747
(nickers)

24:09.749 --> 24:11.115
Bring them home, Max.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.288
(squeaks)

24:17.290 --> 24:18.322
Don't worry, Raps.

24:18.324 --> 24:21.759
If anyone can find
your parents, they can.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.228
(wind whistling)

24:24.230 --> 24:26.797
(grunting)

24:48.187 --> 24:51.789
¶ Maybe I make things a mess ¶

24:51.791 --> 24:55.259
¶ And maybe you're right
to have doubts in me ¶

24:55.261 --> 24:58.162
¶ Maybe, but nevertheless ¶

24:58.164 --> 25:01.932
¶ If you, for once,
could just trust me ¶

25:01.934 --> 25:04.368
¶ Just this once ¶

25:04.370 --> 25:07.771
¶ Let me come
through for you ¶

25:07.773 --> 25:10.774
¶ The way that you
want me to ¶

25:10.776 --> 25:14.144
¶ Let me make you proud ¶

25:14.146 --> 25:17.214
¶ Let me show you
the best in me ¶

25:17.216 --> 25:21.352
¶ Let me give you
a reason to believe ¶

25:21.354 --> 25:24.321
¶ That I can stand tall ¶

25:24.323 --> 25:27.491
¶ And when I return ¶

25:27.493 --> 25:31.128
¶ And I'm more than
you dreamt I'd be ¶

25:31.130 --> 25:33.297
¶ Maybe than you will realize ¶

25:33.299 --> 25:36.367
¶ That you never
actually knew me at all ¶

25:45.912 --> 25:49.213
¶ Sure, I've made
lots of mistakes ¶

25:49.215 --> 25:52.816
¶ I know that
I've disappointed you ¶

25:52.818 --> 25:54.985
¶ Still, though,
whatever it takes ¶

25:56.155 --> 25:59.356
¶ I'm gonna fix it,
just watch me ¶

25:59.358 --> 26:02.026
¶ Just you wait ¶

26:02.028 --> 26:04.995
¶ I'll make it up to you ¶

26:04.997 --> 26:08.399
¶ If it's the last thing
I ever do ¶

26:08.401 --> 26:11.368
¶ I will make you proud ¶

26:11.370 --> 26:15.005
¶ I will make you
have faith in me ¶

26:15.007 --> 26:18.842
¶ I will prove that
the way I used to be ¶

26:18.844 --> 26:22.012
¶ Is all in the past ¶

26:22.014 --> 26:25.249
¶ I will save the day ¶

26:25.251 --> 26:28.419
¶ And come back here
triumphantly ¶

26:28.421 --> 26:31.355
¶ 'Cause I'm all for
that look of surprise ¶

26:31.357 --> 26:36.360
¶ When you see your son
rising at last ¶

26:36.362 --> 26:40.364
¶ The pride in your eyes
when you see your son rising ¶

26:40.366 --> 26:44.201
¶ At last ¶

26:50.543 --> 26:52.142
-(hoots)
-(gasps)

26:55.481 --> 26:56.547
Cass, what is it?

26:56.549 --> 26:58.449
(hoots)

26:58.451 --> 27:00.517
The worst of the storm
is yet to come.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.554
(hoots contentedly)

27:03.556 --> 27:06.256
Unless we do something,
Rapunzel,

27:06.258 --> 27:08.392
the whole island
will be buried.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.061
Our only hope is to call
a state of emergency,

27:11.063 --> 27:13.430
evacuate to the shelters
on the mainland,

27:13.432 --> 27:16.266
and pray this storm
blows over.

27:16.268 --> 27:20.504
We'll never be able to get
everyone to safety in time.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.607
(sighs) That can't be
the only way.

27:23.609 --> 27:26.276
What about Xavier?

27:26.278 --> 27:27.678
Your Highness!

27:27.680 --> 27:29.279
With all due respect,

27:29.281 --> 27:30.914
lives are at stake here.

27:30.916 --> 27:33.517
We can't go chasing
after fairy tales

27:33.519 --> 27:36.320
-in our darkest hour.
-Varian: Princess Rapunzel!

27:37.490 --> 27:39.590
Guard:
Sorry, Princess.
He ran right past--

27:39.592 --> 27:40.991
Wait! It's okay.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.493
Oh! (panting)

27:42.495 --> 27:44.261
Rapunzel! My dad's in danger.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.163
You-- you're the only one
who can help. Please!

27:46.165 --> 27:48.966
You have to come
to Old Corona with me!

27:48.968 --> 27:50.067
Now.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.442
Varian, what's wrong?

27:58.444 --> 27:59.710
Please.
Please, the rocks.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.278
They're-- They're
encasing my dad.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.346
Encasing?

28:02.348 --> 28:03.714
Wh-- what are you saying?

28:03.716 --> 28:04.815
Come! Come!
See for yourself.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.017
You can help! I--
I know you can!

28:07.019 --> 28:08.519
You have a connection
to these rocks.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.954
Varian, it's a state
of emergency here.

28:10.956 --> 28:14.058
I'm sorry.
I-I-I can't help you!

28:14.060 --> 28:15.626
Not right now.

28:15.628 --> 28:16.894
No! No, no, no, no.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.395
Listen to me.
My dad doesn't
have much time.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.230
You are the only one
who can help.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.532
Rapunzel, please.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.500
Your Majesty, please.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.336
Whatever the boy's problem,
it must be set aside.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.305
The storm's growing stronger
by the second.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.007
-No!
-We need you
to make a decision.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.208
No, no, no, please!

28:31.210 --> 28:32.810
Please, Princess, you--

28:32.812 --> 28:34.645
Wha-- you promised
you'd help me!

28:34.647 --> 28:35.746
You promised.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.881
Rapunzel! (shouts)

28:37.883 --> 28:40.084
Princess! My dad needs help!

28:40.086 --> 28:43.487
-No! Don't hurt him.
-Rapunzel!

28:43.489 --> 28:45.055
You promised!

28:45.057 --> 28:46.757
You promised!
(echoes)

28:54.767 --> 28:56.333
Thank you, darling.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.136
(both shuddering)

29:00.506 --> 29:03.006
How's your ankle, honey?

29:03.008 --> 29:05.676
My ankle's the least
of our worries.

29:05.678 --> 29:07.544
The kingdom--

29:07.546 --> 29:09.680
there's so much left to do.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.181
Fred...

29:11.183 --> 29:13.650
she's going to make
a great queen.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.623
Arianna:
Happy anniversary,
sweetheart.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.692
Frederic:
Happy anniversary, Arianna.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.508
No!

29:41.447 --> 29:42.780
No!

29:54.727 --> 29:57.127
(neighs)

30:01.167 --> 30:02.332
There they are!

30:02.334 --> 30:04.468
-Good job, Max.
-(whinnies happily)

30:04.470 --> 30:06.904
Great. So how do we
get down there?

30:08.340 --> 30:11.308
Eugene:
We'll have to reach them
by taking that ridge.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.243
That tiny little thing?

30:13.245 --> 30:14.945
You'd sooner find
a horse on that ledge,

30:14.947 --> 30:16.814
before you get me
to go on there.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.653
That is one determined horse.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.827
(moans)

30:29.829 --> 30:32.095
I knew I should have stopped
at four donuts this morning!

30:32.097 --> 30:33.463
Curse you, crullers!

30:33.465 --> 30:35.465
(echoing)
And your alluring
delectability!

30:35.467 --> 30:36.867
Shh!

30:36.869 --> 30:40.337
-Do you want to bring
that down on us?
-(cracking)

30:40.339 --> 30:43.006
Captain:
Let's get the people
to this point.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.108
-Of course, sir.
-(heavy rumbling)

30:48.814 --> 30:50.113
Your Highness.

30:50.115 --> 30:52.049
I've just come back
from the docks.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.451
Between the wind,
snow, and surging tide,

30:54.453 --> 30:56.253
no ship is leaving Corona.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.355
(gasps)

31:01.026 --> 31:03.026
Princess, I'm sorry.

31:03.028 --> 31:07.364
If we are going to act,
it must be now.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.733
(sighs)
Evacuate the island.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.768
You heard the princess.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.293
Dad! Dad! I'm back!

31:38.430 --> 31:40.864
Dad! Dad, the princess
refused to help,

31:40.866 --> 31:42.099
but I...

31:43.435 --> 31:44.835
Dad?

31:44.837 --> 31:45.936
Oh, no.

31:45.938 --> 31:48.171
No, no. No. No!

31:48.173 --> 31:49.373
No!

31:49.375 --> 31:52.843
Dad! Daddy. No!

31:52.845 --> 31:55.545
(sobbing)
No, no, no, no.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.314
No.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.923
I hope I'm making
the right decision.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.624
-(sighs)
-Cass: You're not, Rapunzel.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.459
You are making
the only decision.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.267
(gasps)

32:21.307 --> 32:23.373
This evacuation...

32:23.375 --> 32:26.276
(sighs) it doesn't
feel right, Cass.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.744
Rapunzel, this is exactly

32:27.746 --> 32:30.013
what your dad would do
if he were here.

32:31.216 --> 32:32.282
(sighs)

32:32.284 --> 32:34.985
If he were here,
he would tell me...

32:34.987 --> 32:36.987
to follow my heart.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.393
What? The Demanitus device?

32:44.797 --> 32:46.229
So I am clear,

32:46.231 --> 32:48.332
we're talking about the
mythical subterranean machine

32:48.334 --> 32:50.133
that can magically
control weather?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.736
Cassandra. In or out?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.640
Looks like we got
a blacksmith to visit.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.942
Princess...

32:58.944 --> 33:03.647
I never said
the Demanitus Device
was real for sure.

33:03.649 --> 33:04.915
I know, Xavier,

33:04.917 --> 33:08.018
but every legend
is born of truth, right?

33:08.020 --> 33:10.520
What if Xan Tiri's
curse is real,

33:10.522 --> 33:13.023
and the storm will not let up
until Corona is destroyed?

33:13.025 --> 33:15.759
Even an evacuation
won't help then!

33:15.761 --> 33:18.328
That machine might be
our only hope.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.330
-Hmm.
-Please.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.598
If the legend is true,

33:21.600 --> 33:23.767
where would the
Demanitus Device be?

33:23.769 --> 33:25.002
Hmm.

33:28.974 --> 33:30.774
I have an idea.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.111
Eugene:
There they are!

33:35.447 --> 33:37.014
Vlad, give me the rope.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.219
(wind whistling)

33:43.956 --> 33:45.222
(groans)

33:51.463 --> 33:53.230
-(grunts)
-(neighs)

33:55.300 --> 33:56.733
(grunting)

33:56.735 --> 33:58.268
(sighs)

33:59.238 --> 34:00.971
(panting)

34:00.973 --> 34:03.306
You know what happens
when I get stressed?

34:03.308 --> 34:05.876
Ah! Ah! Ah--

34:05.878 --> 34:07.544
I'm okay.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.712
What are you trying to do?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.380
Bring the whole mountain
down on top of us?

34:10.382 --> 34:11.515
(sneezes)

34:11.517 --> 34:13.417
-(sneeze echoing)
-(cracking, rumbling)

34:16.488 --> 34:18.455
Oh, man, I hate snow.

34:32.438 --> 34:33.503
Hmm.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.439
According to the legends,

34:35.441 --> 34:37.741
there should be
a passageway here.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.343
Ugh! I knew this
would be a waste of time.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.020
Come on. If we hurry,

34:50.022 --> 34:52.456
we can still catch up
with the rest of the evacuation.

34:55.394 --> 34:56.693
This way.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.601
(sputtering) Oh!

35:05.604 --> 35:06.736
Hello, Your Majesty.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.872
We've come to rescue you.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.607
Lance (muffled):
Eugene! I'm stuck!

35:10.609 --> 35:12.609
I'm stuck! Can't feel my face.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.811
Arianna:
We need to hurry.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.012
The king's hurt.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.787
Keep pushing, people.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.021
We can make it.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.130
(neighs)

35:38.604 --> 35:39.669
Everyone get down!

35:39.671 --> 35:41.705
(explosion)

35:48.080 --> 35:49.746
Captain:
We're trapped.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.789
Rapunzel!

35:59.791 --> 36:01.992
-(gasps)
-Gotcha.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.194
(gulps, squeaks)

36:05.164 --> 36:08.031
I think this is it.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.012
-Cassandra: I don't...
-Rapunzel: Believe it.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.780
Xavier:
Your Highness.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.750
The Demanitus Device.

36:36.128 --> 36:37.661
So this is the device
that's gonna

36:37.663 --> 36:38.995
blow the storm out to sea?

36:38.997 --> 36:41.565
Not if we just stand here
looking at it.

36:41.567 --> 36:44.668
Let's try to get
this machine
up and running.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.603
(grunts)

36:47.906 --> 36:49.940
(rumbling)

37:00.686 --> 37:02.786
(electricity crackling)

37:05.724 --> 37:07.824
I think it's gonna work.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.297
(zapping)

37:29.181 --> 37:30.914
(machine stalls)

37:35.854 --> 37:38.188
Cassandra:
Oh! You have got
to be kidding me!

37:44.863 --> 37:46.263
Lance:
You ready?

37:46.265 --> 37:47.998
Okay, Your Majesty,
this should hold you.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.606
Alright, up there, steady now!

37:56.608 --> 37:58.041
(wind whistling)

37:58.043 --> 37:59.776
(grunting)

37:59.778 --> 38:01.845
No, no, no, no. Oh, no.

38:03.615 --> 38:04.981
(gasping)

38:04.983 --> 38:06.916
Oh, dear! Whoa!

38:06.918 --> 38:08.785
-Frederic!
-(exclaims)

38:08.787 --> 38:11.755
(exclaiming)

38:11.757 --> 38:12.856
Your Majesty!

38:14.893 --> 38:16.793
Hold on, Your Majesty.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.296
(grunting)

38:23.101 --> 38:24.768
Quick! Help me get down there.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.002
(strains)

38:27.973 --> 38:30.006
Eugene.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.609
Please take care of Rapunzel.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.145
We are gonna
get you outta here.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.814
Besides, you should
know by now,

38:37.816 --> 38:40.250
Rapunzel doesn't need anyone
to take care of her.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.093
Rapunzel:
Come on, Pascal!

38:50.095 --> 38:51.995
(straining squeak)

38:51.997 --> 38:53.263
(frustrated squeak)

38:57.869 --> 38:59.869
Okay, Pascal,
let me pull you up,

38:59.871 --> 39:01.771
and we'll figure out
some other way.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.712
Pascal?

39:09.715 --> 39:10.947
Pascal. No!

39:10.949 --> 39:12.782
(echoing)
Pascal!

39:15.854 --> 39:17.253
(rumbling)

39:23.295 --> 39:24.794
Pascal?

39:24.796 --> 39:26.096
(crying)

39:31.136 --> 39:32.235
(straining)

39:33.238 --> 39:34.938
(grunting)

39:38.076 --> 39:40.143
Eugene:
Almost... got you.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.255
(whooshing)

39:58.730 --> 40:00.997
(wind dies)

40:05.771 --> 40:07.937
(cheering)

40:13.779 --> 40:15.779
(sighs) Thank you, son.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.182
Excuse me.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.050
Is that my hat?

40:21.052 --> 40:23.186
(sobbing)
He's gone.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.156
I'm so sorry, Rapunzel.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.125
(Rapunzel sobbing)

40:35.901 --> 40:37.000
Wait.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.736
(panting)

40:39.738 --> 40:40.937
Look!

40:40.939 --> 40:42.939
-(weak squeak)
-(gasps)

40:42.941 --> 40:44.040
Pascal!

40:44.042 --> 40:45.475
(squeak)

40:58.156 --> 40:59.355
(sniffing)

41:07.065 --> 41:08.331
(gasps)

41:34.159 --> 41:35.325
(knocking)

41:35.327 --> 41:38.261
Hey! Celebratory cupcake, huh?

41:38.263 --> 41:41.364
No. Uh, no, thank you.

41:41.366 --> 41:42.799
Hello? Blondie?

41:42.801 --> 41:44.934
Come on. You kicked butt
and saved the day.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.336
What are you upset about?

41:46.338 --> 41:48.705
Eugene, today,
I turned my back

41:48.707 --> 41:51.274
on a desperate
friend in need.

41:51.276 --> 41:55.311
I sent the man I love
to face possible death,

41:55.313 --> 41:57.814
and then did the same
to my oldest friend.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.450
I entrusted the entire
welfare of Corona

42:00.452 --> 42:02.285
to a fairytale.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.387
In a lot of ways...

42:04.389 --> 42:08.191
today was the most
difficult day of my life.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.793
Sweetheart,
what are you saying?

42:10.795 --> 42:12.395
I--

42:12.397 --> 42:15.865
I'm not sure
I want to be queen.

42:18.403 --> 42:20.003
Hey, Rapunzel.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.237
I know today
was overwhelming,

42:21.239 --> 42:24.007
and I can't say I wouldn't
be feeling the same way,

42:24.009 --> 42:27.176
but you becoming queen
is a long time away.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.078
Just know that
when that time comes,

42:29.080 --> 42:31.180
no matter what you decide...

42:31.182 --> 42:32.448
I will be right
here with you.

42:34.219 --> 42:37.020
Thank you for bringing
my parents home.

42:37.022 --> 42:39.055
Hey. You got it.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.894
Don't worry, Dad.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.563
I will get
to the bottom of this.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.466
I promise.

42:53.071 --> 42:56.539
¶ I will make you proud ¶

42:56.541 --> 42:59.442
¶ Get the answers
and set you free ¶

42:59.444 --> 43:01.110
¶ Don't you worry ¶

43:01.112 --> 43:03.546
¶ Whatever it might take ¶

43:03.548 --> 43:06.416
¶ I'm finding a way ¶

43:06.418 --> 43:09.452
¶ And I swear right now ¶

43:09.454 --> 43:12.855
¶ That no matter
what comes of me ¶

43:12.857 --> 43:17.360
¶ Anybody who stands
or has stood in my path ¶

43:17.362 --> 43:20.964
¶ They are going to pay ¶

43:22.534 --> 43:23.967
They...

43:25.070 --> 43:26.502
will...

43:28.306 --> 43:29.439
(angrily)
pay.

43:39.451 --> 43:42.518
(theme music playing)
