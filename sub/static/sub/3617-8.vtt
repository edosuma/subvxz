Don't worry about it--

00:52.459 --> 00:55.900
Good, because I'd hate to spend
the weekend in Big Sur arguing.

- You and me.

01:08.125 --> 01:10.651
But that's not a "yes."

01:10.751 --> 01:15.626
It's just that this isn't
really going to work.

01:17.375 --> 01:19.375
Okay, we could reschedule.

01:20.375 --> 01:23.334
Not the weekend, us.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.999
I'm really sorry.

Yeah, me too.

Oh, there he goes.

01:35.417 --> 01:37.442
I really thought that one
was a keeper.

01:37.542 --> 01:40.442
Why? Because he was
cute and funny

01:40.542 --> 01:42.899
and oh, yeah, don't let me
forget, deliciously yummy?

01:42.999 --> 01:44.899

in a row she's dumped.

01:47.083 --> 01:48.899
So do you think she has
commitment issues

01:48.999 --> 01:50.859
or do you think she's
just too picky?

01:50.959 --> 01:53.401
I don't know. I'd love to
speculate, but I gotta go.

01:53.501 --> 01:55.859

01:55.959 --> 01:58.899
The Flaming Lips are
playing at your club.

not gonna scare them when
you go backstage.

02:01.999 --> 02:03.776

- Okay.

02:03.876 --> 02:05.899
I gotta go home to interview
magical nannies tomorrow

02:05.999 --> 02:07.776

- Wait, magical nannies?

02:07.876 --> 02:09.526
You mean like Mary Poppins?

02:09.626 --> 02:10.899
One could only hope, but no.

02:10.999 --> 02:13.899
Leo has arranged for us to
meet supernatural creatures

02:13.999 --> 02:15.899
that have child-care experience.

02:15.999 --> 02:18.442
- Creatures?
- And it's not like
I can call a service

02:18.542 --> 02:20.899
and ask for a nanny to watch
over my little Charmed One

02:20.999 --> 02:22.983

slay slimy demons.

But don't you think
it's a little early

even showing yet.

large

02:30.459 --> 02:32.234

definitely in charge.

is normal about this pregnancy.

I don't know, I could
just kind of tell it wasn't
really going anywhere,

cut this one off at the pass

At least you don't have
to worry about if he's
gonna attack again.

you mention him...

contacted me in a while.

- Yeah, it is for me.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.900
I'm just worried about
the rest of humanity.

Cole doesn't just do nothing,

charge.

Well, it is half of who I am.

Is it a Whitelighter-to-be?

07:23.250 --> 07:25.651

07:25.751 --> 07:27.899
- Not exactly.
- Oh, wait, don't tell me.

07:27.999 --> 07:30.526
It's a young girl. A witch.

- Sorry.
- All I can tell you
about your charge

is that he is a good man
who's lost his way.

07:43.999 --> 07:46.025
And why is that
all you can tell her?

07:46.125 --> 07:47.859

want Paige

07:47.959 --> 07:49.859
to figure the rest
out for herself.

Yeah, see,
you're being vague.

is Samuel.

Okay, where do I find him?

08:00.167 --> 08:01.818
The Elders aren't sure.

be able to sense his location.

Paige can find him?

faith in Paige's abilities.

that they know what they're

- Cole?
- I tossed it.

08:40.918 --> 08:43.442
- You tossed it?
- It wasn't strong enough.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.734
I tried it on that letter opener
that had Cole's blood on it,
but it barely dented it.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.899
Well, you have to figure out
a way to make another one

08:48.999 --> 08:50.567

Hang on a second, lady.
What are you talking about?

a bar and a vigilante killed
them.

an arrest warrant, not a potion.

dark and handsome

09:01.584 --> 09:03.899

with the wave of a hand.

jump to conclusions

all the facts before you act.

work on the potion.

10:13.292 --> 10:15.899

10:15.999 --> 10:20.818
And we don't have to limit
ourselves to choosing between
good and evil.

10:20.918 --> 10:22.899
We can drive them both.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.818

10:24.918 --> 10:27.192
We are only a few.

10:27.292 --> 10:30.275
But we are preparing to wield
a power, the likes of which

10:30.375 --> 10:32.442
this world has never seen.

10:32.542 --> 10:35.709
And we want you
to be a part of it.

10:38.999 --> 10:41.899
Let me make myself clear.

10:41.999 --> 10:44.083
I want nothing to do with you.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.651
You can't fight us, Cole.

It is futile to try.

10:55.999 --> 10:59.192

you will join us.

old self again, huh?

11:11.999 --> 11:13.859
Get out of here.

11:13.959 --> 11:15.899

two people last night?

11:15.999 --> 11:17.484
I don't have time for this.

11:17.584 --> 11:19.234
Well, you better
make time for this.

11:19.334 --> 11:21.275
I can't be good,
I won't be evil.

want from me?

two criminals.

something else?

It was easy.
It felt very natural.

11:37.751 --> 11:41.776
You just don't get it, do you?

11:41.876 --> 11:44.899
They weren't only two criminals.
They were two human beings,
Cole.

11:44.999 --> 11:48.899
Spare me the judgmental crap.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.109
You have no idea what
I'm going through right now.

11:52.209 --> 11:54.942
No, I don't, and I don't
want to know.

11:55.042 --> 11:56.899
Then why are you still here?

11:56.999 --> 11:58.776
I'm here to warn you.

11:58.876 --> 12:02.692
If you kill another person,
good or evil...

12:02.792 --> 12:05.192
...I will vanquish you.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.942
You really think you have
the power to vanquish me?

12:08.042 --> 12:09.999
Try me.

12:15.459 --> 12:18.234
I might just do that.

12:18.334 --> 12:20.692
If this is where I was supposed
to find my charge,

12:20.792 --> 12:23.651
you might have told me
not to wear my Jimmy Choos.

12:23.751 --> 12:24.899
Jimmy who?

12:24.999 --> 12:26.501

12:29.167 --> 12:34.192
So I'm guessing my
"wealthy philanthropist"
theory was wrong.

12:34.292 --> 12:37.317
I told you he was a lost
soul and needed saving.

12:37.417 --> 12:41.401
Yeah, this definitely
looks like a place where
lost souls would hang out.

12:41.501 --> 12:45.150
Probably also some rats,
some roaches...

12:45.250 --> 12:47.526
...and human waste.

12:47.626 --> 12:50.899
- At least my cover will work.
- Cover?

to tell Samuel something.

No, it's more like
a magnetic pull.

13:55.999 --> 13:57.567

finally tracked me down,

14:37.459 --> 14:38.942
with a novice, no less.

You need to work up a cover.

14:44.999 --> 14:48.150
Didn't you read
the Whitelighter manual?

14:48.250 --> 14:50.359
There's a manual?

14:50.459 --> 14:54.526
I can't believe the Elders
sent a newbie out after me.

14:54.626 --> 14:56.609

the Elders saddled me

14:56.709 --> 14:59.250

as my first charge.

15:03.501 --> 15:08.999
You've got spunk,

No, I will not go away.

Am I expected to protect
the baby from the

15:47.584 --> 15:50.484
I'd say "incessant" is a bit
of an overstatement.

15:50.584 --> 15:53.609
You are a Charmed One, correct?

15:53.709 --> 15:57.651
Yes, but that won't
affect your job here.

- Won't it?
- No, honey, it won't.

16:02.334 --> 16:05.359

they're such pessimists.

attack us in the house so...

25:41.459 --> 25:44.442
I just don't quite see
why the big secret.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.401
Why couldn't anybody tell me?

25:46.501 --> 25:48.918
I should have told you.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.334
I'm sorry.

25:58.918 --> 26:01.501
I was hoping we could talk.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
PHOEBE: Go ahead, honey,
I'll finish the potion.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.000
Yeah, we can talk.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.626
I'm here for you if you need me.

26:26.584 --> 26:29.083
You hate me, don't you?

26:30.209 --> 26:32.567
Why should I?
You're a stranger to me.

26:32.667 --> 26:35.234
That's a perfectly
fair statement.

26:35.334 --> 26:37.900
Spoken like a
true Whitelighter.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.776
But not a father.

26:39.876 --> 26:41.692
I had a father.

26:41.792 --> 26:43.859
One who made me proud
to be his daughter.

26:43.959 --> 26:45.734
And it's not you.

26:45.834 --> 26:48.899
I haven't made you
very proud, have I?

26:48.999 --> 26:52.025
No offence,
but I don't know you.

26:52.125 --> 26:53.609
And I actually
haven't spent

26:53.709 --> 26:56.067
a lot of time over the years
thinking about you.

26:56.167 --> 26:58.067
Well, maybe you should.

26:58.167 --> 27:00.734
After all, I'm the one
that gave you up at birth.

27:00.834 --> 27:03.709
That has to have caused
you some pain.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.025
Hey, nice job, you guys.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.900
- What do you mean?
- Sam's in there talking to
Paige.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.899
- What?
- That's impossible.

27:15.999 --> 27:17.334
Sam refused to come back.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.899
You can pretend all you want
that it hasn't affected you.

27:22.999 --> 27:24.899
But we both know
better than that.

27:24.999 --> 27:26.899
How would you know?

27:26.999 --> 27:28.776
Who the hell do you
think you are anyway?

27:28.876 --> 27:31.776
- Paige.
- That's not Sam.

27:31.876 --> 27:35.542
- What are you talking about?
- She's talking about this.

27:38.959 --> 27:40.317
You son of a bitch.

27:40.417 --> 27:44.999
Wait, it gets better,
all right? Ronan!

27:48.667 --> 27:50.609
- What happened?
- He's immune.

27:50.709 --> 27:52.209
Not to this.

27:56.626 --> 27:58.000
Uh-oh.

Whoa.

28:08.292 --> 28:09.375
Ooh.

28:10.584 --> 28:12.375
Let's go.

You can't stop the bleeding,
can you?

28:36.459 --> 28:38.292
Shh. Just try and rest.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.334
- How's Leo doing?
- He's been better.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.401
I can't believe Cole
would go this far.

28:47.501 --> 28:50.067
Yeah, and why now,
what's the occasion?

28:50.167 --> 28:52.734
Because he's pure evil.

28:52.834 --> 28:56.899
Yeah, but it's just not smart.
And good or evil, Cole is
usually smart.

28:56.999 --> 28:58.651
Well, he's obviously
lost his mind.

28:58.751 --> 29:02.818
I mean, he killed two people
yesterday in public.

29:02.918 --> 29:05.442
I've been thinking about
the vanquishing potion.

29:05.542 --> 29:07.983
Maybe if you mixed three
different ones...

29:08.083 --> 29:10.526
No, you're gonna be able
to make the vanquishing potion

29:10.626 --> 29:12.818
just as soon as we figure
out a way to heal you.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.401
We gotta find Sam.
He's our only chance.

29:16.501 --> 29:19.899
So now I'm screwed.

29:19.999 --> 29:22.567
Don't think like that.

29:22.667 --> 29:25.192
Why? Sam bails,
that's what he does.

29:25.292 --> 29:28.734
This time won't
be any different.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.234
It's different because now
you're the one that's hurt.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.401
So you gotta find him.

29:34.501 --> 29:38.526
And I'll go get him and bring
him back here and Phoebe will
stay with you and Leo.

29:38.626 --> 29:40.025
You can't go alone.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.899
No, I'm not alone.

29:41.999 --> 29:45.899
Apparently the baby here
prefers Mommy to be
indestructible.

29:45.999 --> 29:48.042
That's a good point. You go.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.459
It's up to you, you gotta
sense him. Concentrate.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

What are you doing here?

30:24.918 --> 30:27.818
Protecting him from you.

30:27.918 --> 30:31.275
I kept up my end of the bargain.
You said I could have him.

30:31.375 --> 30:34.567
This isn't about you.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.401
Or about him, for that matter.
It's about me.

30:38.501 --> 30:42.526
What difference does it
make to you whether the
Whitelighter lives or dies?

30:42.626 --> 30:45.818
I need him alive,
so he can heal the witch
and their Whitelighter.

30:45.918 --> 30:47.526
Heal them?

30:47.626 --> 30:49.401
You wanted me
to help you kill them.

30:49.501 --> 30:51.818
Because I want them
to come after me.

30:51.918 --> 30:56.025
You kill Sam, they'll come
after you and I can't have that.

30:56.125 --> 30:59.417
You never had any intentions
of letting me kill him, did you?

31:00.876 --> 31:02.609
Walk away, Ronan.

You need to heal them.

I don't know, it's been so long.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.899
Well, there's no one else.
You have to do it.

Look, if you think you've
screwed up in the past,

31:44.918 --> 31:48.209

to start making amends.

- I can't.

32:25.792 --> 32:29.067
It's no use.
This is my punishment.

because you gave up.

No, it was not.

to worry about her at all.

vanquish.

34:44.417 --> 34:46.692
So you think
this is gonna work?

34:46.792 --> 34:49.150
These are at least
as strong as the ones
we used on The Source,

34:49.250 --> 34:52.067
- so yeah, I think.
- But you can't be sure?

I can't be sure of
anything until I try it.

not good enough.

35:08.999 --> 35:12.899
No other potion has
been able to destroy this

35:12.999 --> 35:14.776
since Cole's blood
has been protecting it,

35:14.876 --> 35:18.401
but if these potions are
as strong as I think they are,

will go a long way.

ask me that question?

- No, you said it yourself.

want to kill us.

perfectly fine.

I guess...

40:50.125 --> 40:52.899
...the Elders knew
better after all.

40:52.999 --> 40:56.899
When you gave me up,
you made a choice

40:56.999 --> 41:01.734
that gave me the
most amazing gift.

41:01.834 --> 41:06.651
You see, I got to have

each other fiercely.

- I think I'm a little burnt out

on the whole "emotional
roller coaster" thing right now.

call Trevor.

Oh, that guy. Yeah, that guy
that you just dumped.

42:31.999 --> 42:36.317
Well, maybe I'll also
rethink that whole
"dumping perfectly nice guys

42:36.417 --> 42:38.899
before I give them
a chance" thing.

42:38.999 --> 42:41.899
I guess meeting Sam made me
realize I kind of still have

42:41.999 --> 42:45.000
some abandonment issues
I might want to work through.

42:47.250 --> 42:49.317
Anything from you over there
in the peanut gallery?

42:49.417 --> 42:52.651
I'm sorry,
I'm just freaking out.

42:52.751 --> 42:55.942
Having an invincible ex-husband
is making me really nervous.

42:56.042 --> 42:59.417
Well, the good thing is
we've got someone
invincible of our own.

43:00.918 --> 43:02.442
I got you covered.

43:02.542 --> 43:04.584
For now.
