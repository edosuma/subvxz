WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:04.286
[humming]

00:04.329 --> 00:07.550
All done with the card,
Cricket. Did you get the flowers?

00:07.594 --> 00:08.812
[grunting]

00:08.856 --> 00:10.597
Got them right here, Tilly.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.034
Can you believe there are
peopleout there who buy flowers?

00:13.077 --> 00:15.297
They grow everywhere for free.
Just take them.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.560
Now remember,
we've got to be extra sweet

00:17.604 --> 00:19.388
when Gramma gets home
from the doctor.

00:19.431 --> 00:21.564
Papa's bringing her back
from cataract surgery,

00:21.608 --> 00:23.044
so it's our duty
as grandchildren

00:23.087 --> 00:25.742
to be extra loving
in her time of need.

00:25.786 --> 00:27.222
Cat-attack surgery?

00:27.265 --> 00:29.267
Guess you can be pushed too far,
huh, Dirtbag?

00:29.311 --> 00:30.573
Meow?

00:30.617 --> 00:32.096
No, Cricket.

00:32.140 --> 00:33.683
She had a small operation
to fix her eyesight.

00:33.707 --> 00:36.666
She probably won't be
her same spunky self,

00:36.710 --> 00:39.669
so don't be alarmed
if she looks weak and fragile.

00:39.713 --> 00:42.498
Hyah! Who keeps moving
the doorknob around?

00:42.542 --> 00:44.326
Is this one of your pranks, Cricket?

00:44.369 --> 00:47.721
- Uh, over here, Gramma.
- Don't patronize me, boy.

00:47.764 --> 00:50.811
Now, Ma for the last time,
until the bandages come off,

00:50.854 --> 00:52.639
you won't be ableto see for awhile.

00:52.682 --> 00:54.249
I don't need eyes to see.

00:54.292 --> 00:56.077
And I've got stuff to do today.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.557
Stuff?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.602
Can't whatever
you want to do wait?

00:59.646 --> 01:01.561
It most certainly cannot.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.606
And just because my eyes
are under the weather

01:03.650 --> 01:07.349
doesn't mean I can't do
my normal Tuesday routine!

01:07.392 --> 01:10.918
First, I'll pick up my favorite newspaper,
theTuesday Gazette.

01:10.961 --> 01:12.920
It's the only news
that caters to country folk

01:12.963 --> 01:14.617
who ain't into any phooey.

01:14.661 --> 01:16.663
[spitting]

01:16.706 --> 01:19.100
After that, I'll head over
to Greasy Gus's Burger Stand.

01:19.143 --> 01:21.581
They've been selling
the best burgers in Big City

01:21.624 --> 01:23.626
since it was still called
Big Country.

01:23.670 --> 01:24.932
[all spit]

01:24.975 --> 01:26.977
I've done this every Tuesday
for years,

01:27.021 --> 01:28.675
and nothing has ever stopped me.

01:28.718 --> 01:31.678
That can't be true.
I was born on a Tuesday,

01:31.721 --> 01:34.419
so you must've missed going
at least once, right, Ma?

01:34.463 --> 01:35.769
Ma?

01:35.812 --> 01:37.118
[moaning]

01:37.161 --> 01:38.554
- [popping sound]
- [baby cries]

01:38.598 --> 01:40.338
Whew. Welcome to life.

01:40.382 --> 01:41.905
[chomping]

01:41.949 --> 01:44.473
I didn't want to know that.

01:44.516 --> 01:45.953
Now I've got my cane
and my purse,

01:45.996 --> 01:47.955
and no one's going to stop me
from leaving.

01:47.998 --> 01:50.958
Being a purse.
This is my purpose now.

01:51.001 --> 01:52.437
Now let's see.

01:52.481 --> 01:54.788
Just got to find the front door.

01:54.831 --> 01:56.751
Oh, for Pete's sake,
if it's so important to you,

01:56.790 --> 01:58.618
I can get your paper and burger.

01:58.661 --> 02:01.664
Do I look like I need
anyone's help?

02:01.708 --> 02:05.668
Of course you don't.
But think of this as a day off.

02:05.712 --> 02:07.148
You get to sit back and relax,

02:07.191 --> 02:08.865
while we get to take
careof everything for you.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.673
Hm. All right, Bill.

02:10.717 --> 02:12.849
Just this once.

02:12.893 --> 02:14.721
Really? Oh, that's a relief.

02:14.764 --> 02:16.679
Here's the address
for the burger stand.

02:16.723 --> 02:18.246
Now if you'll excuse me,

02:18.289 --> 02:21.162
I think I'll head to my room
and rest for awhile.

02:21.205 --> 02:22.792
Okay, you know she's upto something, right?

02:22.816 --> 02:24.818
[sighs]
Yeah, I know.

02:24.861 --> 02:26.689
Just hold down the fort
while I'm gone.

02:26.733 --> 02:29.736
Make sure Gramma doesn't get up
to any Gramma stuff.

02:29.779 --> 02:31.781
Papa don't leave us alonewith her.

02:31.825 --> 02:33.063
Now, it's not going to be
that bad.

02:33.087 --> 02:35.263
I'll be right back before you
know it.

02:35.306 --> 02:37.961
You might want to barricade
the door, just in case.
Good luck, kids.

02:38.005 --> 02:39.746
- [door closes]
- [loud crash]

02:41.573 --> 02:43.271
Gramma?

02:43.314 --> 02:45.142
[Tilly]
Is everything okay?

02:45.186 --> 02:46.709
Hm. Where'd she go?

02:46.753 --> 02:48.189
- [loud crash]
- Look!

02:49.190 --> 02:50.713
Gramma? Ah!

02:50.757 --> 02:52.715
Gramma, you almost
sliced my head off.

02:52.759 --> 02:56.153
Then you keep your head
out of my escape route!

02:56.197 --> 02:57.720
Gramma, I'm over here.

02:57.764 --> 03:00.114
- Oh.
- Just let us take care of you.

03:00.157 --> 03:01.942
We can all relax
until Papa gets back

03:01.985 --> 03:03.813
with your burger and newspaper.

03:03.857 --> 03:05.597
He ain't getting no burger.

03:05.641 --> 03:07.774
I gave him a fake address.

03:07.817 --> 03:09.166
Why would you do that?

03:09.210 --> 03:11.560
Because he insisted I needed
to recover

03:11.603 --> 03:14.302
like some frail old softy.

03:14.345 --> 03:16.391
But you do needto recover.

03:16.434 --> 03:19.786
What I need to do
is my Tuesday routine!

03:20.787 --> 03:22.745
Hyah! Tactical roll.

03:22.789 --> 03:25.139
Oh, my gosh. She's loose.

03:25.182 --> 03:26.749
Okay, got the newspaper.

03:26.793 --> 03:28.272
Just got to find
that burger joint.

03:28.316 --> 03:29.752
According to the address
Ma gave me,

03:29.796 --> 03:32.755
it should be right... here?

03:32.799 --> 03:35.758
Who knew Ma went in
for trendy places like this?

03:35.802 --> 03:37.760
Let's take a gander here. Hm.

03:37.804 --> 03:39.370
Cube BRGR.

03:39.414 --> 03:41.764
The Make-Believe-A-BRGR.

03:41.808 --> 03:43.113
Is this reallya burger place?

03:43.157 --> 03:45.812
Welcome to BRGR.
May I take your order?

03:45.855 --> 03:48.771
Can I get a...
normal burger?

03:48.815 --> 03:50.120
- [all gasp]
- Sir!

03:50.164 --> 03:52.557
There are no "normals" here.

03:52.601 --> 03:54.124
Burgers come in all
shapes and sizes.

03:54.168 --> 03:56.779
- Every one is unique.
- Oh, boy.

03:56.823 --> 03:58.346
Okay, which way
do you think she went?

03:58.389 --> 03:59.913
[tires squeal, loud crash]

03:59.956 --> 04:03.220
My Cricket senses tell me,
probably this way.

04:03.264 --> 04:05.242
- [indistinct chattering]
- [man] She came out of nowhere.

04:05.266 --> 04:07.834
- [groaning]
- Hey, pal, are you blind?

04:07.877 --> 04:09.879
Watch where you're going.

04:09.923 --> 04:11.596
Look what she just did.
We got to stop her.

04:11.620 --> 04:12.839
Hold on, brother.

04:12.882 --> 04:14.101
What if we don't stop her?

04:14.144 --> 04:17.017
What if we help her?

04:17.060 --> 04:19.802
She's too prideful.
She'd never let us help her.

04:19.846 --> 04:22.849
Then we'll have to do it
without her knowing.

04:22.892 --> 04:25.808
I see what you're getting at.
Devilishly clever.

04:25.852 --> 04:27.549
[mumbling]

04:29.551 --> 04:31.814
[man]
Hey! Over here!

04:31.858 --> 04:33.860
[whimpering]

04:33.903 --> 04:35.383
Hm.

04:35.426 --> 04:36.776
[grunting]

04:39.822 --> 04:41.215
Oh!

04:41.258 --> 04:43.434
[indistinct chattering]

04:43.478 --> 04:45.828
Is this the latest edition
of the Tuesday Gazette?

04:45.872 --> 04:47.656
[all gasp]

04:47.699 --> 04:49.745
I always check outthe funnies first.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.878
- What the...?
- [all scream]

04:51.921 --> 04:53.836
What kind of paper is this?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.882
- I'm talking to you, young man.
- [sobbing]

04:55.925 --> 04:57.840
[grunting]

04:57.884 --> 05:00.800
Hello? I'd like to speak
to your manager, please.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.150
Huh? Oh, there it is.

05:03.193 --> 05:04.934
Time to get my burger on.

05:06.370 --> 05:07.850
[Tilly whimpering]

05:11.854 --> 05:13.813
- [both] Whew!
- We did it.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.859
Now we just got to get Gramma
back home, and we're done.

05:16.903 --> 05:18.818
Well, Greasy Gus,
after all these years,

05:18.861 --> 05:22.082
you still make the greasiest
burger around.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.519
Hey, it's all I know.

05:24.562 --> 05:26.477
Would you believe
the nerve of my family,

05:26.521 --> 05:27.933
thinking I couldn't hack it
on my own

05:27.957 --> 05:30.786
just because of a little
eye surgery?

05:30.830 --> 05:32.614
If they'd seen how well
I've done today

05:32.657 --> 05:34.790
even without my sight,

05:34.834 --> 05:37.097
they'd be eating those words!

05:37.140 --> 05:40.100
In fact, I think I could
take on something

05:40.143 --> 05:41.884
a little more exciting.

05:41.928 --> 05:43.886
More exciting?

05:43.930 --> 05:45.627
[people muttering]

05:45.670 --> 05:46.889
Come on!

05:46.933 --> 05:48.978
Uh... uh...

05:49.022 --> 05:50.893
Oh, gosh, this is the worst.

05:50.937 --> 05:52.634
Whoa, dude, your boots.

05:52.677 --> 05:54.854
M-M-My boots?
Are they offensive?

05:54.897 --> 05:56.986
No, I love them.

05:57.030 --> 05:58.596
Those are originalDeerharts boots.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.555
Oh, they are so vintage.

06:00.598 --> 06:02.252
Oh, you have a good eye.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.864
I've had these babies
for the last 20 years.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.909
The weathered look is so killer.

06:06.953 --> 06:08.911
Dude, also, you need to tell me

06:08.955 --> 06:11.566
where you got these
pre-distressed jeans from.

06:11.609 --> 06:12.872
Pre-distressed?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.656
Not sure what
you're talking about,

06:14.699 --> 06:17.050
but I wore all the holes
you seethrough hard work.

06:17.093 --> 06:18.660
- [all gasp]
- What?

06:18.703 --> 06:20.705
[excited chatter]

06:20.749 --> 06:22.403
[chuckles]
Gee.

06:22.446 --> 06:24.666
[moaning softly]

06:24.709 --> 06:28.148
Oh, man, where's she going now?

06:28.191 --> 06:30.672
- Oh, that's trash, Gramma.
- No, don't dig around in trash.

06:30.715 --> 06:33.414
[grunts and laughs]

06:33.457 --> 06:34.719
What the...?

06:34.763 --> 06:35.807
Oof!

06:35.851 --> 06:37.940
What is this place?

06:37.984 --> 06:41.988
[Cricket]
It looks like some kind
of seedy hangout for old folks.

06:42.031 --> 06:43.685
Maybe she came in here
by accident.

06:43.728 --> 06:44.860
Nah, I don't think so.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.166
Guess who's back and ready

06:46.209 --> 06:48.690
for a high-stakes game of darts.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.039
[all]
Alice!

06:50.083 --> 06:51.911
- Dang it, Gramma.
- I'm here to take on

06:51.954 --> 06:53.825
the reigning champ.

06:53.869 --> 06:55.871
- Huh?
- [woman] Is that so?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.961
Even when you could see me you
never could beat me at darts.

06:59.005 --> 07:01.181
Laugh it up, Gertie.
I'm going to make you regret

07:01.224 --> 07:04.184
ever crossing paths
with Alice Green.

07:04.227 --> 07:07.535
Uh, Alice, over here?

07:07.578 --> 07:08.971
With Alice Green!

07:09.015 --> 07:11.974
Oh, no. How are we goingto
help Gramma with this?

07:12.018 --> 07:13.845
Alice, listen,
you don't have your sight,

07:13.889 --> 07:15.369
you don't have any money.

07:15.412 --> 07:17.327
So, no, thanks.

07:17.371 --> 07:18.850
I don't need my eyes
to beat you.

07:18.894 --> 07:20.548
And as for my money...

07:20.591 --> 07:22.158
[grunts]

07:22.202 --> 07:24.247
...feast your eyes on this.

07:24.291 --> 07:26.728
- [both] Huh?
- [Gramma] It's limited edition.

07:26.771 --> 07:28.295
Very valuable.

07:28.338 --> 07:29.905
- [all] Aw!
- Ooh, I want that.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.603
That would complete
my collection.

07:32.647 --> 07:34.605
Gertie, I'm so sureI can beat you

07:34.649 --> 07:38.000
that I'm willing to bet
this little darling on it.

07:38.044 --> 07:39.828
So, what do you say?

07:39.871 --> 07:42.135
Hm. Add him to the pot.

07:42.178 --> 07:44.964
All right, here's the rules.

07:45.007 --> 07:48.054
First to get three bull's-eyes
wins the pot.

07:48.097 --> 07:51.057
Gramma will never be able
to do that.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.538
So, Alice, you're up.

07:54.582 --> 07:56.192
And you take a knife and, well,

07:56.236 --> 07:57.846
just start cutting
chunks of wood off.

07:57.889 --> 07:59.848
This is called "whittling."

07:59.891 --> 08:01.067
- Oh, gee!
- Cool.

08:01.110 --> 08:02.851
Bill Green, as a gift,

08:02.894 --> 08:05.854
we've made a very
special burgerjust for you.

08:05.897 --> 08:07.943
We call it the Bill.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.553
A plain and normal burger!

08:09.597 --> 08:11.120
This is just what my ma needs.

08:11.164 --> 08:12.861
See you around.

08:12.904 --> 08:14.906
There goes Bill Green.

08:14.950 --> 08:17.344
What an absolute unit.

08:17.387 --> 08:19.433
Whenever you're ready, Alice.

08:19.476 --> 08:21.435
I wish I could see
the look on your face

08:21.478 --> 08:23.611
when I mop the floor with you.

08:23.654 --> 08:25.439
Highly unlikely, Gramma.

08:25.482 --> 08:27.615
Get ready for a whupping.
Hyah!

08:27.658 --> 08:29.051
[all gasp]

08:30.879 --> 08:33.055
- Incoming!
- [all growl]

08:33.099 --> 08:35.144
He's gotten so big.

08:35.188 --> 08:36.972
[screams]

08:37.016 --> 08:39.844
- Okay, she's doomed.
- Cricket, do something.

08:39.888 --> 08:41.629
- Pretty good, huh?
- Loud distraction.

08:41.672 --> 08:44.153
Loud distraction!

08:44.197 --> 08:46.068
Cricket, what the heck
is wrong with you?

08:46.112 --> 08:48.418
Why'd you follow me
to this seedy place?

08:48.462 --> 08:50.246
Tilly would never
have done that.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.988
As much as I'd like to remain
in your good graces, Gramma,

08:53.032 --> 08:54.076
I'm here too.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.078
Are you kidsspying on me?

08:56.122 --> 08:58.080
No, Gramma, we're here to help you.

08:58.124 --> 09:01.083
I've been doing my whole routine
no problem.

09:01.127 --> 09:02.954
Gramma, you've been able
to do your routine

09:02.998 --> 09:05.914
because we've been helping you
from the shadows.

09:05.957 --> 09:08.264
Bullpucky.
I don't need any help.

09:08.308 --> 09:10.049
Oh, really? Then hit the dartboard.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.528
Let me show youhow it's done.

09:11.572 --> 09:13.052
- [both scream]
- It's okay.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.357
It's the fake one.

09:14.401 --> 09:16.098
No it's not, Gramma.

09:16.142 --> 09:18.057
Oh. Shoot.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.103
Okay, maybe it is true
you've been helping me all day.

09:21.147 --> 09:23.105
I always thought
that as I got older,

09:23.149 --> 09:26.891
I could just grit my way throughit,
no matter the limitation.

09:26.935 --> 09:29.851
Maybe I'm just not
as invincible as I thought.

09:29.894 --> 09:31.853
Well, everybody
needs help sometimes.

09:31.896 --> 09:34.116
Yeah, even superheroes
need sidekicks.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.119
But that doesn't mean
you're not our Super Gramma.

09:37.163 --> 09:39.165
[Gertie]
Ahem!

09:39.208 --> 09:42.211
There's a matter
of our little wager.

09:42.255 --> 09:44.039
Right, Gertie. Here's the deal.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.997
Turns out my lucky streak
was actually a streak

09:46.041 --> 09:48.217
of having wonderful grandkids.

09:48.261 --> 09:50.915
So why don't we just
call it a draw.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.613
No way, you old broad.

09:52.656 --> 09:55.094
We agreed that best
out of threewins the pot.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.487
Well, in that case... yoink!

09:57.531 --> 09:58.967
Go, go, go, go!

09:59.010 --> 10:01.056
- [bone cracks]
- Ah, my hip.

10:02.710 --> 10:03.972
[sighs]

10:04.015 --> 10:05.147
Here's your chamomile tea.

10:05.191 --> 10:07.410
And I made you
a "you got well" card,

10:07.454 --> 10:09.432
since you won't be able
to read it until you're better.

10:09.456 --> 10:12.198
Thank you, Cricket.
I look forward to seeing it.

10:12.241 --> 10:13.938
Hey, Ma, sorry I'm late,

10:13.982 --> 10:15.422
but I got your paper
and your burger.

10:15.462 --> 10:17.420
Thanks, son, but I'm good.

10:17.464 --> 10:20.684
Why don't you go ahead
and enjoy that burger yourself?

10:20.728 --> 10:21.990
I don't mind if I do.

10:22.033 --> 10:23.905

10:23.948 --> 10:27.952
