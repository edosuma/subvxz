( <i>singing in native language</i> )

01:10.033 --> 01:11.501
Everybody sing.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.767
Hey, Bobby...

01:14.801 --> 01:17.000
Hey. How come
you look so happy?

01:17.033 --> 01:19.300
You know, this really strange
thing happened to me last night.

01:19.334 --> 01:21.200
I called you up
to see if you wanted

01:21.234 --> 01:22.934
to go out for a
beer or something

01:22.968 --> 01:24.267
and you weren't home.
Right.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.267
I talked to this girl
on your answering service...

01:27.300 --> 01:28.567
Named Angela.

01:28.601 --> 01:29.834
Oh, she's terrific.

01:29.868 --> 01:31.234
My favorite operator.

01:31.267 --> 01:33.200
You know, I call
for my messages,

01:33.234 --> 01:34.567
and all the rest of them

01:34.601 --> 01:36.501
they just say,
"Still nothing."

01:36.534 --> 01:38.667
You know, an actor
doesn't like to hear that

01:38.701 --> 01:40.634
but Angela--
nobody called me--

01:40.667 --> 01:43.100
she gives me
other people's messages.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.934
Yeah, yeah, she really seemed
nice on the phone, you know?

01:45.968 --> 01:47.467
Oh, unbelievably nice.

01:47.501 --> 01:48.734
LOUIE:
Hey, Rieger?

01:48.767 --> 01:51.567
Sometimes she gives me
Gene Shalit's messages.

01:51.601 --> 01:52.567
Really?

01:52.601 --> 01:53.634
Yeah. Gene and me

01:53.667 --> 01:55.667
we use the same service,
you know.

01:55.701 --> 01:57.100
A lot of stars call him.

01:57.133 --> 01:58.934
You know who
called him yesterday?

01:58.968 --> 01:59.467
Who?

01:59.501 --> 02:02.334
Erma Bombeck.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.901
Hey, you ever been out
with Angela, Bobby?

02:05.934 --> 02:08.800
Angela?
From your answering service?

02:08.834 --> 02:10.100
Oh, she's a peach.

02:10.133 --> 02:13.033
One night she and I discussed
my boxing career.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.367
You know, we never even met

02:14.400 --> 02:17.467
and still we must have talked
for around five minutes.

02:17.501 --> 02:21.968
That's longer than
most of your fights last.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.901
Yeah.

02:23.934 --> 02:27.033
We talked
for a while too.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.667
Over an hour.

02:28.701 --> 02:30.234
Wow, an hour?
Hold it.

02:30.267 --> 02:32.267
You tied up my line
for an hour?

02:32.300 --> 02:34.567
Alex, I could be
getting acting jobs

02:34.601 --> 02:35.701
during that time.

02:35.734 --> 02:37.234
I sort of forgot about the time.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.267
I mean she was
so terrific on the phone.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.634
Hey, how come you never thought
about asking her out?

02:42.667 --> 02:44.634
Well, I almost
asked her out once

02:44.667 --> 02:47.033
but I decided against it,
it wasn't worth the risk.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.334
What risk?

02:48.367 --> 02:50.300
She might turn out to be a dog.

02:50.334 --> 02:51.334
Oh.

02:51.367 --> 02:52.334
Geez.

02:52.367 --> 02:55.200
Did you just geez at me, Elaine?

02:55.234 --> 02:57.167
I can't believe you.
I mean you wouldn't go out

02:57.200 --> 02:58.868
with a woman
if she wasn't good looking?

02:58.901 --> 03:00.367
Sure, I would.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.567
If I was real drunk
or something.

03:02.601 --> 03:05.701
Hey come on, Elaine.

03:05.734 --> 03:07.868
Looks matter
to women too.

03:07.901 --> 03:11.400
How popular are short,
pudgy, ugly men?

03:11.434 --> 03:13.200
Yeah. How popular, Louie?

03:13.234 --> 03:14.868
You know, Bobby

03:14.901 --> 03:17.567
I hope someone slams a door
on your nose

03:17.601 --> 03:21.100
and you sneeze
and your head explodes.

03:22.667 --> 03:26.601
If you had such a good
conversation with her, Alex

03:26.634 --> 03:28.734
why don't you ask her out?

03:28.767 --> 03:31.234
Well, I'm thinking about it.

03:31.267 --> 03:34.234
Yeah, well, I got to call
for my messages.

03:34.267 --> 03:36.501
Hey, if Angela
should happen to answer

03:36.534 --> 03:37.701
should I...

03:37.734 --> 03:38.701
No.

03:38.734 --> 03:41.267
All right, whatever,
but you better move fast.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.234
Why?

03:42.267 --> 03:44.567
So you can tell me
what she's like.

03:44.601 --> 03:45.934
Hi.

03:45.968 --> 03:48.367
Any for Wheeler, 131?

03:48.400 --> 03:51.167
Anything for Shalit?

03:52.434 --> 03:56.567
Hey, Angela, how'd you like
talking to my friend, Alex?

03:56.601 --> 03:57.934
Oh, yeah.

03:57.968 --> 03:59.901
He's even better
than he sounds.

03:59.934 --> 04:01.834
Sure. I'll describe
him to you.

04:01.868 --> 04:04.667
Before Bobby gets cute,
I, uh...

04:04.701 --> 04:06.467
Oh, this is Alex.

04:06.501 --> 04:08.400
Oh, yeah?

04:10.334 --> 04:12.501
Yeah, I remember your voice, too

04:12.534 --> 04:14.567
even though I knew it was you.

04:14.601 --> 04:17.233
I mean, even if I didn't know
it was you

04:17.267 --> 04:20.500
and I heard your voice,
I would know it was you.

04:20.534 --> 04:22.267
You want to go out with me?

04:22.300 --> 04:23.267
Smooth, Alex.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.901
Would you get out of here?

04:24.934 --> 04:25.901
Oh, boy.

04:25.934 --> 04:26.968
What,
"Oh, boy?"

04:27.000 --> 04:28.200
What you got
there, Latka?

04:28.234 --> 04:31.167
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

04:32.634 --> 04:34.200
Okay, okay, Latka.

04:34.234 --> 04:35.434
Shh! Slow down, okay?

04:35.467 --> 04:36.434
Slow down.

04:36.467 --> 04:37.701
Okay.

04:37.734 --> 04:41.267
( <i>speaking native language</i>
<i>slowly</i> )

04:48.834 --> 04:50.400
You found it
on the back seat.

04:50.434 --> 04:52.267
Yeah.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.501
2,000 bucks.

04:54.534 --> 04:56.634
2,000 smackers.

04:56.667 --> 05:00.000
Not smackers. Bucks.

05:00.033 --> 05:04.434
Latka, you found the 2,000 bucks

05:04.467 --> 05:05.968
I've been looking for.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.801
Hey, you never lost
2,000 bucks.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.167
I didn't say I lost it.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.868
I just said I was
looking for it.

05:10.901 --> 05:13.634
I've been looking
for 2,000 bucks all my life.

05:13.667 --> 05:16.200
Hands off, Louie.

05:16.234 --> 05:17.701
MAN:
Hey, Louie...

05:17.734 --> 05:19.200
it's your mother calling.

05:19.234 --> 05:21.968
She says somebody's trying
to break into her apartment.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.367
Tell her I'll
get back to her.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.200
That's your mother.

05:26.234 --> 05:28.267
All right.
I'll talk to her now.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.801
Don't do nothing with that money
while I'm gone.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.634
Listen, somebody has
to bring this up.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.834
The hack rules say
that this money

05:36.868 --> 05:39.467
must be returned to
the police precinct.

05:39.501 --> 05:40.467
No police.

05:40.501 --> 05:41.701
Oh, it's okay,
if we turn it in

05:41.734 --> 05:43.968
and nobody claims it
within 90 days

05:44.000 --> 05:45.634
then it's returned
to us, free and clear.

05:45.667 --> 05:49.000
No police, no police,
no nothing.

05:49.033 --> 05:50.467
Just money.

05:52.767 --> 05:55.467
You know, it's probably
dirty money, right?

05:55.501 --> 05:57.133
I mean what kind
of decent person

05:57.167 --> 05:59.968
walks around with 2,000 bucks
in cash, right?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.634
A priest who collected it

06:01.667 --> 06:04.133
for underprivileged
crippled children.

06:04.167 --> 06:07.534
Or a nun on her way to send it
to starving natives.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.567
Or a hooker.

06:11.934 --> 06:14.501
Hey, Alex, listen,
we got a little problem.

06:14.534 --> 06:16.901
Latka just found
this bunch of money...

06:16.934 --> 06:19.234
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

06:22.934 --> 06:25.501
Oh, it gets better
every time he tells it.

06:25.534 --> 06:28.100
Anyway, we're trying
to decide what to do.

06:28.133 --> 06:30.000
Yeah? Good.
I got to leave.
I got a date.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.000
With Angela?

06:31.033 --> 06:32.000
Uh-huh.

06:32.033 --> 06:33.300
Hey, way to go.

06:33.334 --> 06:36.200
I never worked so hard
for a date in my life.

06:36.234 --> 06:37.534
Hey, where you
taking her?

06:37.567 --> 06:39.701
Well, I thought I'd take her
to dinner, uh, Mario's.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.868
It's a nice place,
but stay away

06:41.901 --> 06:44.534
from the clams oreganata
with eggplant.

06:44.567 --> 06:46.467
It killed my sister-in-law.

06:47.534 --> 06:50.067
Have a good time, Alex.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.767
Doesn't get any better.

07:18.067 --> 07:21.234
Hi. I'm Alex.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.567
You blew it.
You could have said

07:22.601 --> 07:24.234
you were looking
for another apartment.

07:24.267 --> 07:26.501
No. I was looking
for this one, 3-D.

07:26.534 --> 07:28.968
It fell off
when I knocked on... door.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.334
Well, my admirers

07:30.367 --> 07:33.868
will just have to wander
the halls looking for me.

07:33.901 --> 07:36.767
I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm Angela.

07:36.801 --> 07:39.934
Oh. Here's your "D."

07:39.968 --> 07:41.234
You want to come in?

07:41.267 --> 07:44.300
Huh? Yeah. Sure.

07:45.934 --> 07:48.133
You got guts.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.334
It's very nice.

07:55.367 --> 07:56.968
You're doing very well.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.033
Huh?

07:58.067 --> 07:59.534
The smile, I mean.

07:59.567 --> 08:03.300
Most guys drop it
ten seconds after they see me.

08:03.334 --> 08:05.367
You can stop now.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.701
You've got the record.

08:06.734 --> 08:08.968
Say...

08:09.000 --> 08:12.267
so, Angela...

08:12.300 --> 08:14.267
This is really
very nice.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.200
Do you want to use
the phone?

08:16.234 --> 08:17.200
What for?

08:17.234 --> 08:18.534
To call your mother.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.934
Maybe you'll be lucky
and she'll be sick

08:20.968 --> 08:23.334
and you'll have to run over
and see her.

08:23.367 --> 08:26.167
( <i>laughs</i> )

08:26.200 --> 08:29.167
That's some sense of humor
you got there, Angela.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.434
Well, listen,
our dinner reservations

08:31.467 --> 08:32.933
aren't for about an hour

08:32.967 --> 08:35.067
so you want to get something
first somewhere else--

08:35.100 --> 08:36.033
a drink or something?

08:36.067 --> 08:37.366
You must know

08:37.400 --> 08:40.033
a really dark bar
where no one will see us.

08:40.067 --> 08:43.067
We don't have to go anywhere
if you don't want to.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.634
We can have a drink here.

08:44.667 --> 08:47.734
Sure, why take any chance
on anyone seeing you with me.

08:47.767 --> 08:48.968
What would you like to drink?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.501
What do you got?

08:51.534 --> 08:53.367
Malteds.

08:53.400 --> 08:57.567
Listen, we can get something
at the restaurant.

08:57.601 --> 08:59.534
Hope you like Italian.

08:59.567 --> 09:00.534
Doesn't matter.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.467
As you can see, I eat anything.

09:03.567 --> 09:05.868
If you want, I could fix you
something here.

09:05.901 --> 09:07.834
You don't want to go out?

09:07.868 --> 09:08.968
I don't care.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.367
I was just trying
to make it easy on you.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.701
Get your coat.

09:13.734 --> 09:15.501
What are you trying to prove?

09:15.534 --> 09:17.033
That you're a great guy?

09:17.067 --> 09:19.501
Okay. You're a great guy.
A real prince.

09:19.534 --> 09:22.434
Um... here.

09:22.467 --> 09:24.534
Here's your coat.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.901
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

09:26.934 --> 09:29.067
Hey, I asked you out for dinner,
we're going out for dinner.

09:31.868 --> 09:33.067
It will be fun.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.200
You'll see.

09:35.234 --> 09:36.901
Fat chance.

09:41.767 --> 09:44.834
Do you like clams oreganata
with eggplant?

10:00.334 --> 10:02.267
I never met anybody

10:02.300 --> 10:03.834
who liked anchovies.

10:03.868 --> 10:06.300
Rich people probably like them.

10:06.334 --> 10:08.200
Rich people
like anything

10:08.234 --> 10:11.934
that's small that tastes weird.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.801
Why don't you drop
the act now, huh?

10:15.834 --> 10:16.901
What? What act?

10:16.934 --> 10:18.968
Pretending that you're not
having a lousy time.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.667
Hey, come on, Angela,
would you?

10:22.100 --> 10:24.400
What do you still got
your coat on for?

10:24.434 --> 10:26.567
The management requested it.

10:26.601 --> 10:29.100
Don't you care
for your salad?

10:29.133 --> 10:31.567
I wouldn't know if I
cared for it or not.

10:31.601 --> 10:32.567
I didn't eat it.

10:32.601 --> 10:33.901
Hey, what's with you?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.067
What's the matter? Aren't you
having a good time anymore?

10:36.100 --> 10:37.868
I once went out with a girl

10:37.901 --> 10:40.133
who pulled a knife on me,
robbed me

10:40.167 --> 10:43.734
and threw me out of her car
on the New Jersey turnpike.

10:43.767 --> 10:46.901
I have to think about that now
as a medium date.

10:46.934 --> 10:49.634
So you want to take me home now?

10:49.667 --> 10:51.367
Yeah, I'd be happy to.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.501
There he is.

10:55.534 --> 10:57.000
Let's go out this way.

10:59.934 --> 11:01.601
Hey, Alex,
I'm really sorry.

11:01.634 --> 11:02.868
I tried to stop them

11:02.901 --> 11:05.067
from coming down
and bothering you.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.300
Angela Matusa

11:06.334 --> 11:09.601
this is Tony Banta,
John Burns, Latka Gravas

11:09.634 --> 11:12.434
and Bobby Wheeler,
who I guess you sort of know.

11:12.467 --> 11:14.634
Nice to finally meet you,
Angela.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.634
Am I what you pictured,
Bobby?

11:16.667 --> 11:19.801
Yeah, more or less.

11:19.834 --> 11:22.734
More.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.367
What are you guys doing here?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.367
ANGELA:
If you'll excuse me.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.601
I have to use the ladies' room.

11:30.267 --> 11:31.400
Hey, Alex...

11:31.434 --> 11:32.734
So how's your big date?

11:32.767 --> 11:34.133
All right, stop that.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.167
( <i>laughter</i> )

11:35.200 --> 11:36.300
That's not funny.

11:36.334 --> 11:37.567
Hey.

11:37.601 --> 11:40.200
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

11:41.434 --> 11:43.167
I think Latka likes her.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.267
Do you like her, Latka?

11:44.300 --> 11:45.968
Maybe Alex will give you
her number.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.901
You could call her up
for tomorrow night.

11:47.934 --> 11:49.934
Oh, no.
Thank you very much.

11:51.501 --> 11:52.734
All right, what
do you clowns want?

11:56.300 --> 11:59.601
Yeah. Why don't you
sit down?

11:59.634 --> 12:01.567
Well, you know the money
that Latka found?

12:01.601 --> 12:03.667
We're still trying
to decide what
to do with it.

12:03.701 --> 12:05.334
We wanted you
to hold onto it

12:05.367 --> 12:07.601
until we figure out
what to do with it,
all right?

12:07.634 --> 12:08.934
Yeah, because otherwise

12:08.968 --> 12:12.000
we're going to have
to spend the night as a group

12:12.033 --> 12:13.834
'cause nobody trusts nobody.

12:13.868 --> 12:14.968
Except you.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.534
Everybody trusts you.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.567
Okay.

12:19.567 --> 12:21.100
Want to give us

12:21.133 --> 12:22.601
a receipt?

12:23.567 --> 12:25.501
Oh, here comes Angela.

12:28.434 --> 12:29.868
Now be polite, huh?

12:29.901 --> 12:31.234
Control yourself.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.467
Oh, hi.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.868
Good to see you back.

12:33.901 --> 12:35.434
Everything go all right

12:35.467 --> 12:36.734
in the ladies' room?

12:36.767 --> 12:38.267
We should be going now.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.901
Nice meeting you,
Angela.

12:39.934 --> 12:40.901
See you.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.267
Yeah, so long.

12:44.367 --> 12:45.567
Bet your friends

12:45.601 --> 12:47.634
got quite a kick
out of me, huh?

12:47.667 --> 12:48.934
What do you mean?

12:48.968 --> 12:51.267
I heard them all break up
when I left.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.534
They weren't laughing at you.

12:52.567 --> 12:53.300
No?

12:53.334 --> 12:54.200
No.

12:55.501 --> 12:57.701
One of the guys told a joke.

12:57.734 --> 13:00.367
Why are you afraid to tell me
they were laughing at me?
I can take it.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.501
Because they weren't.
Now can we drop this?

13:02.534 --> 13:04.934
All I know is, I heard a big
laugh when I left the table.

13:04.968 --> 13:06.300
I told you what it was.

13:06.334 --> 13:07.834
What do you want from me?

13:07.868 --> 13:09.133
I want you to stop lying to me.

13:09.167 --> 13:12.167
You've been lying to me
all night, and I'm sick of it.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.167
Okay.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.234
They were laughing at you, okay?

13:19.901 --> 13:21.434
You could have held out.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.634
I was almost ready
to believe you.

13:23.667 --> 13:24.567
Look, you don't have

13:24.601 --> 13:26.400
to bother
seeing me home.

13:26.434 --> 13:27.501
No, I'll take you.

13:27.534 --> 13:29.634
No, really. I'm one of
the few women in New York

13:29.667 --> 13:31.167
who's safe
on the streets.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.567
Come on, you came with me,
you're leaving with me.

13:33.601 --> 13:35.567
Listen, let's not spoil
a lovely evening

13:35.601 --> 13:36.634
by arguing, okay?

13:36.667 --> 13:37.767
And hey, don't worry.
You did your duty.

13:37.801 --> 13:39.767
You proved
you were a nice guy.

13:39.801 --> 13:41.734
I'm taking you.

13:41.767 --> 13:43.167
Get your paws off me.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.033
They give you a little dinner,
they think they own you.

13:59.567 --> 14:01.868
Latka! Will you cut it out?!

14:01.901 --> 14:05.267
You're not going to find
any more money.

14:05.300 --> 14:08.501
Besides, these cabs
got to go out soon

14:08.534 --> 14:12.000
but they can't go out
with no back seats

14:12.033 --> 14:15.067
'cause where
will our passengers sit?

14:15.834 --> 14:17.367
You want them to squat

14:17.400 --> 14:19.133
on the floor like ducks?

14:19.167 --> 14:21.067
Okay.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.100
Put the damn seats back

14:23.133 --> 14:24.801
you dumb foreigner.

14:24.834 --> 14:25.934
Come on!

14:25.968 --> 14:27.200
Foreigner?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.334
Yeah.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.367
Did you said foreigner?

14:29.400 --> 14:30.200
Yeah.

14:30.234 --> 14:32.234
For you.

14:34.234 --> 14:36.501
What's that mean?

14:36.534 --> 14:37.868
Means this.

14:40.534 --> 14:43.801
You better smile
when you do that, buddy.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.100
Oh, yeah?

14:47.434 --> 14:50.400
Okay, pal, mull this one over.

14:52.367 --> 14:53.467
Oh, all right.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.067
I accept your apology.

15:03.267 --> 15:05.534
But we still don't know
who was driving

15:05.567 --> 15:07.400
when the money was left in it.

15:08.534 --> 15:09.567
Hi, Alex.

15:09.601 --> 15:12.167
Hey, Alex,
did you score?

15:12.200 --> 15:13.834
Shut up.

15:13.868 --> 15:16.067
I guess not.

15:17.634 --> 15:19.067
Geez.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.167
I heard about your date.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.267
Oh, yeah?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.434
Yeah.

15:23.467 --> 15:24.801
I wonder how come?

15:24.834 --> 15:29.667
You get some real kooks
on blind dates, boy.

15:29.701 --> 15:31.234
Like this one.

15:31.267 --> 15:34.968
I show up--
looking good, per usual--

15:35.000 --> 15:38.501
and this girl
comes to the door.

15:38.534 --> 15:39.634
Beautiful.

15:39.667 --> 15:41.434
Not your type.

15:41.467 --> 15:43.667
Right,
'cause to be honest

15:43.701 --> 15:47.634
I prefer my women "H and H"--
homely and hot.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.033
I misjudged you, Louie.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.901
You're really a poet, you know?

15:50.934 --> 15:52.033
You bet.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.200
Can I have
my receipt, please?

15:54.234 --> 15:57.868
Anyway, all of a sudden,
she says, "I feel sick."

15:57.901 --> 16:01.200
Tells me she thinks
she was exposed to cholera

16:01.234 --> 16:02.501
earlier that day.

16:02.534 --> 16:05.067
So, what did you do?

16:05.100 --> 16:06.901
I tried to take
her blouse off.

16:06.934 --> 16:08.834
It's not my fault
she feels sick

16:08.868 --> 16:11.501
so why shouldn't one of us
have a good time, right?

16:11.534 --> 16:14.234
You know, every time
I talk to you, Louie

16:14.267 --> 16:16.968
I feel grateful
that I haven't eaten yet.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.534
Heard about your date.

16:18.567 --> 16:21.868
Oh, yeah, what was it,
broadcast over the PA?

16:21.901 --> 16:23.267
Yeah.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.367
Hey, Elaine,
can I talk to you

16:28.400 --> 16:29.434
for a minute?

16:29.467 --> 16:30.701
Yeah, sure.

16:30.734 --> 16:32.234
I don't want any advice.

16:32.267 --> 16:33.567
I just want to talk.

16:33.601 --> 16:34.801
Go ahead.

16:34.834 --> 16:38.033
I can't stop thinking
about that girl.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.267
You know,
you're a terrific guy.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.634
That's not what
I want to hear.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.734
It just goes to show you
how terrific you are.

16:43.767 --> 16:45.367
All night long,
she kept accusing me

16:45.400 --> 16:46.701
of going through
the motions--

16:46.734 --> 16:49.033
that I wouldn't call
her again because
of her looks

16:49.067 --> 16:51.234
and I kept telling
her she was wrong.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.534
Terrific.

16:52.567 --> 16:53.834
But she wasn't wrong.

16:53.868 --> 16:54.968
Oh, Alex, you too?

16:55.033 --> 16:57.133
No. Listen,
what I can't figure out

16:57.167 --> 16:59.534
is that hour I had
with her on the phone

16:59.567 --> 17:02.767
was one of the greatest
conversations I've ever had.

17:02.801 --> 17:04.634
A witty, bright,
sensitive girl

17:04.666 --> 17:06.666
who came to the door
disappeared.

17:06.701 --> 17:08.000
What happened to her?

17:08.032 --> 17:10.934
Maybe Angela ate her.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.767
It wasn't just her looks.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.300
She was also
the bitterest, surliest

17:21.334 --> 17:23.666
most depressing person
I ever met.

17:23.701 --> 17:27.367
So, how come I feel
like I have to go see her again?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.434
I don't know.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.033
You got an answer for that?

17:30.067 --> 17:31.100
Yeah, I feel like

17:31.133 --> 17:33.067
I'm walking away
from a car wreck

17:33.100 --> 17:34.901
with a person trapped inside.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.701
That's true.

17:36.734 --> 17:39.667
I'm going to go see her.

17:39.701 --> 17:40.767
Oh, before I forget

17:40.801 --> 17:42.868
you can give us
that money back now.

17:42.901 --> 17:44.601
Even though we're
nowhere near

17:44.634 --> 17:46.267
figuring out
how to split it.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.501
Hey, listen, Latka found it.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.767
Why don't you give
it all to him?

17:48.801 --> 17:51.033
That's one we
didn't think of.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.767
What are you talking about?

17:52.801 --> 17:56.033
He doesn't know what to do
with that kind of money.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.934
Yeah, he'll probably
just blow it

17:57.968 --> 17:59.601
on rent or food
or something.

17:59.634 --> 18:01.734
How can you give it to him?

18:01.767 --> 18:04.767
You want to pop the veins
in my head?

18:04.801 --> 18:07.901
Here, Latka,
take your money.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.667
Okay, you guys.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.934
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

18:17.734 --> 18:20.634
Thank you very much.

18:24.367 --> 18:25.400
Hey, no, no.

18:25.434 --> 18:26.734
Latka, Latka, please.

18:26.767 --> 18:27.868
Please, not now.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.667
Let's make it seven out of 13.

19:05.334 --> 19:07.267
What are you doing
this time

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
praying
nobody will be home?

19:09.334 --> 19:13.000
Huh? No. Listen, I just
dropped by because I, I...

19:13.033 --> 19:14.200
Come in if you want.

19:14.234 --> 19:16.367
Okay.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.634
I guess I should have called
first, but, uh...

19:20.667 --> 19:22.801
Hey, is this
our second date?

19:22.834 --> 19:23.801
I don't know.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.701
Let's say it is.
I've never had one.

19:25.734 --> 19:28.000
Okay, it's our second date.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.000
Good, so far it looks like
I haven't been missing anything.

19:31.033 --> 19:33.434
Hey, Angela? Will you just let
me get out what I have to say?

19:33.467 --> 19:34.701
Because I don't want to end up

19:34.734 --> 19:37.100
with us doing that stupid stuff
that we did last night.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.334
You mean falling in love?

19:38.367 --> 19:39.968
Would you like to hear
what I have to say or not?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Can I get a drink first?

19:41.033 --> 19:42.901
I have a feeling
I'm going to need a drink.

19:42.934 --> 19:44.234
Yeah, go ahead.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.834
You want anything?
No, thanks.

19:45.868 --> 19:48.400
So, what's on your mind?

19:50.267 --> 19:51.567
Well, I, uh...

19:51.601 --> 19:53.033
I don't really know.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.033
I, uh...

19:55.067 --> 19:58.667
I guess I would sort of like
to get to know you better.

19:58.701 --> 19:59.667
Why?

19:59.701 --> 20:00.868
Why not?

20:00.901 --> 20:03.534
Well, you might not know
to look at me

20:03.567 --> 20:07.567
but I'm not exactly beautiful,
or, uh, even good-looking.

20:07.601 --> 20:09.033
I'm not quite plain.

20:09.067 --> 20:12.300
Now, feel free to jump in
and stop me anytime.

20:12.334 --> 20:13.434
Hey, come on.

20:13.467 --> 20:15.467
I'm no Robert Redford,
you know.

20:15.501 --> 20:18.000
I wouldn't mind looking like you
if I was a man.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.701
Would you want
to look like me?

20:19.734 --> 20:21.400
Wouldn't be so bad.

20:21.434 --> 20:24.634
I'd, you know,
kind of fix up my hair

20:24.667 --> 20:28.868
and, uh... I'd do that
sort of stuff with makeup

20:28.901 --> 20:33.200
and, uh, I'd go to a gym,
and I'd work on myself.

20:33.234 --> 20:34.868
I mean,
that's what I would do.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.501
Not that I'm saying
that you should do anything.

20:37.534 --> 20:40.334
It's just what I would do.

20:40.367 --> 20:43.567
Okay, let's say I did
all the hairdo and makeup

20:43.601 --> 20:46.033
and everything and dropped
ten or 70 pounds.

20:46.067 --> 20:47.868
Do you think I'd be attractive?

20:49.634 --> 20:51.300
Do you think I'd be attractive?

20:52.968 --> 20:54.467
Yeah, sure, why not?

20:54.501 --> 20:56.133
In a romantic sort of way?

20:56.167 --> 20:58.300
You don't have
to answer.

20:58.334 --> 21:00.200
You could just nod.

21:00.234 --> 21:02.133
Hey, look, I'm not, uh...

21:02.167 --> 21:06.000
I haven't been romantically
involved in eight years

21:06.033 --> 21:09.567
and I'm not about to break
my streak right now.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.767
Hey, look, but we, uh...
we did have fun

21:11.801 --> 21:14.300
talking on the phone
the other day, didn't we?

21:14.334 --> 21:16.133
I mean, that
was sort of special.

21:16.167 --> 21:18.467
Hey, look, I swear
I'm not that comfortable

21:18.501 --> 21:19.734
with that many people.

21:20.934 --> 21:23.400
I just think that we
could get to be friends.

21:23.434 --> 21:25.534
I can't believe you came
all the way back here

21:25.567 --> 21:27.133
just because
you forgot to give me

21:27.167 --> 21:28.601
the "let's be friends" speech.

21:28.634 --> 21:30.100
Hey, can we drop that?

21:30.133 --> 21:34.234
I just think I'd like to get
to know you better, that's all.

21:34.267 --> 21:35.734
You want me to open up?

21:35.767 --> 21:38.300
Would that
make you happy?

21:38.334 --> 21:40.200
Make you feel like

21:40.234 --> 21:43.767
you did your good deed
for the day?

21:43.801 --> 21:45.167
Okay. Okay.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.767
But then you better plan on
sticking around.

21:46.801 --> 21:48.300
Because I'm not standing here
alone

21:48.334 --> 21:50.968
with my insides on the floor,
while you walk out

21:51.000 --> 21:53.300
feeling you did
the poor fat girl some big favor

21:53.334 --> 21:55.934
by helping her get in touch
with her feelings.

21:58.501 --> 22:00.133
You want to be a hero?

22:00.167 --> 22:01.601
Then be prepared
to stick around

22:01.634 --> 22:03.100
for the rest of the war, okay?

22:04.300 --> 22:06.167
Maybe I will.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.667
But can we start slower--

22:07.701 --> 22:09.234
like where we went
to high school

22:09.267 --> 22:11.767
and then we'll work up
to your insides on the floor?

22:17.534 --> 22:22.601
Hey, Angela, I think we had
a normal moment there.

22:22.634 --> 22:23.934
Huh?

22:26.334 --> 22:28.067
Well, listen, uh,
you don't mind

22:28.100 --> 22:29.434
if I get a little clear

22:29.467 --> 22:31.634
on what we're trying
to establish here.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.634
It wouldn't make you nuts,
would it?

22:33.667 --> 22:35.367
No, it would not
make me nuts.

22:39.701 --> 22:40.901
So, uh...

22:40.934 --> 22:43.367
so, what it is, is, is...

22:43.400 --> 22:47.334
I could call you
whenever I feel like it?

22:47.367 --> 22:50.734
If I need advice,
I could call you?

22:50.767 --> 22:53.133
Yeah.

22:54.634 --> 22:58.367
Uh... if you need advice,
you could call me?

22:58.400 --> 23:00.200
Yup.

23:00.234 --> 23:03.834
If we have something
interesting happening

23:03.868 --> 23:06.067
we could call each other?

23:06.100 --> 23:08.434
Yeah.

23:08.467 --> 23:11.167
We could call
just to shoot the breeze?

23:12.400 --> 23:13.501
Yeah.

23:14.868 --> 23:15.868
Yup.

23:15.901 --> 23:20.300
Or, uh...

23:20.334 --> 23:23.767
if I just need a hug?

23:37.434 --> 23:41.501
Uh, you know how long
it's been since I cried?

23:41.534 --> 23:43.400
No.

23:43.434 --> 23:45.267
A half an hour.

23:56.734 --> 23:59.667

24:23.767 --> 24:25.534

Night, Mr. Walters.
