00:37.737 --> 00:40.228
Technically, what happened wasn't my fault.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.398
I'm a minor.

00:41.474 --> 00:44.773
I'm not responsible
for my actions... technically.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.712
- Where are you going?
- Running away. What does it look like?

00:52.786 --> 00:54.447
- We gotta stick with the plan.
- No!

00:54.554 --> 00:58.251
But these things should be taken
on a case-by-case basis.

00:58.324 --> 01:01.589
In our case, I've always
been the responsible party.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.289
- We gotta get out of here.
- Stick with the plan.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.625
Oh, God.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.462
Someone had to look out for him.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.235
Welcome to McDonald's.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.938
Can I have a Number 1?

01:20.013 --> 01:22.504
Actually, can I have
a five-piece chicken?

01:22.615 --> 01:24.776
Um, but instead of the Coke

01:24.851 --> 01:26.944
I want a McFlurry
with extra Oreos,

01:27.020 --> 01:28.510
and make sure
they stir it in.

01:28.621 --> 01:32.284
And then a Number 1 with mustard, ketchup...

01:32.358 --> 01:34.019
Pickles and lettuce only.

01:34.127 --> 01:37.528
When my father went away,
I lived alone in our house.

01:37.630 --> 01:43.034
Which was not exactly normal,
but at least I had a routine.

01:46.005 --> 01:50.305
Before, when he was home,
I could never exactly get comfortable

01:50.376 --> 01:55.313
because it always felt like
something was about to happen.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.694
What?

02:52.772 --> 02:54.262
Oh, yeah,
it was so weird,

02:54.374 --> 02:56.706
I don't know whether
I dreamt it, you know,

02:56.776 --> 02:59.108
or heard it on the news.

02:59.212 --> 03:03.546
Naked Chinese men
washing ashore by the dozens

03:03.616 --> 03:07.575
up and down
Southern California beaches

03:07.687 --> 03:09.917
at sunrise.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.258
Boat people, you know?

03:13.359 --> 03:16.726
The boat stops outside
the maritime limit,

03:16.796 --> 03:18.889
they put their clothes
in plastic bags,

03:18.965 --> 03:22.867
and they swim ashore.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.234
Naked Chinese guys.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.102
Fuckin' amazing.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.440
Naked Chinese guys?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.309
Jesus Christ.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.906
Don't people go to hospitals
to get better?

04:01.808 --> 04:05.471
It would've been easier
if we'd just sold the house,

04:05.578 --> 04:06.909
because the way
the market was,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.572
we would've cleaned up.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.014
But Charlie grew up
in our house;

04:11.117 --> 04:12.584
he refused to leave.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.310
Even though we were
barely getting by.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.921
Before I was born, he had
already lived several lives

04:23.997 --> 04:26.659
and managed to avoid
fatherhood for a lot of years.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.792
I'm pretty sure my arrival
took him by surprise.

04:39.178 --> 04:42.636
Once, when things went south
for Charlie in Saint Louis,

04:42.715 --> 04:44.706
he had to pawn that bass.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.945
He said that everything
really started to go wrong after that.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.115
And they didn't start going right again
until he found it two years later

04:51.190 --> 04:53.658
in a pawn shop in Atlanta.

04:53.726 --> 04:56.854
He said things were
all right after that,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.523
all evidence to the contrary.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.852
Oh, shit!

05:42.075 --> 05:43.599
What's going on?

05:43.710 --> 05:46.440
Great things.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.776
So, it was time to get back

05:48.881 --> 05:51.076
on that ol' bipolar
pony and ride.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.381
Naked Chinese guys.
Hee hee hee!

06:08.234 --> 06:10.725
Pepper and Charlie spent
years together on the road

06:10.803 --> 06:13.897
with a five-piece jazz combo.

06:13.973 --> 06:17.602
Once, after a club date
on the Kentucky side of Cincinnati,

06:17.710 --> 06:20.543
Pepper ate so many pancakes
at a Denny's that the busboys

06:20.613 --> 06:23.446
had to unbolt the table
to get him out of the booth.

06:24.984 --> 06:27.418
Hey-hey,
lookin' good, man.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.949
Lost some weight.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.752
It's the chemo.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.385
Oh.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.554
Hey, might as well
put that away.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.995
I'm not playing anymore.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.760
Some other time.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.768
I'm not doing that,
either.

06:43.836 --> 06:48.102
Oh, it's a whole new
Charlie.

06:48.174 --> 06:51.302
- Hello, Miranda.
- Hey, Pepper.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.276
How are you, sweetie?

06:59.285 --> 07:00.752
What the hell is that?

07:01.988 --> 07:04.923
It's my uniform.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.458
You got a job?

07:08.361 --> 07:09.851
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

07:09.962 --> 07:11.827
No, wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.523
Is this Christmastime?

07:15.301 --> 07:17.428
It's March.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.300
Oh.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.000
Well, then, why aren't
you in school?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.201
I had to give
school up, Charlie.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.641
I had to make money,
you know,

07:25.711 --> 07:27.838
while you were gone
for two years.

07:28.714 --> 07:29.703
Huh.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.046
I'll be back around 10.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.709
You working at night?

07:33.820 --> 07:35.219
Yeah.
I gotta go.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.118
Wait, wait,
you working at night?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.988
I mean, that's not good.
It's not a safe place. I don't like that.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.822
It's not the old McDonald's
on Alameda.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.452
It's a new one
on Crest Parkway.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.363
Crest Parkway.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.662
Some new neighborhood,
Tierra Buena Estates.

07:48.734 --> 07:49.666
I don't know.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.203
Where the fuck is that?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.034
Hey, can I get a ride
from you tomorrow?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.700
I gotta see a man about a job.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.208
No way.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.711
I got an interview.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.982
Yeah, sure,
I'll give you a ride.

08:10.590 --> 08:14.082
You make me laugh.

08:14.193 --> 08:16.855
When Charlie was in the mental hospital,

08:16.929 --> 08:19.363
Social Services thought
I was with my mother.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.560
And Child Welfare thought
I was with my father.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.533
My father thought
I was with my mother.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.004
My mother thought
I was with a foster family.

08:27.073 --> 08:31.169
Somewhere, some foster family
thought I was with my father, and so on.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.006
Welcome to McDonald's.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.876
By working double shifts
and keeping expenses low,

08:35.948 --> 08:39.679
I was able to buy
a car on Ebay.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.845
They didn't know
who they were selling it to.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.116
An unlicensed 15-year-old
looks the same

08:44.222 --> 08:46.191
as everyone else on Ebay.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.591
It's like the Social Services thing,

08:48.694 --> 08:50.559
nobody sees anybody.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.856
I admit, it's a beater...

08:56.869 --> 08:58.200
...but a safe beater.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.110
Things were a lot different
when Charlie was gone.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.374
Easier.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.474
In some ways,
things were wonderful.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.388
You always get home so late?

09:24.463 --> 09:26.897
It's none of your
business, Charlie.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.662
Why don't you try
calling me "Dad"?

10:14.981 --> 10:19.509
Animals were popping up
in the most unlikely places.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.314
Someone from work
said she saw a deer

10:21.387 --> 10:23.651
in the cosmetics aisle at Target.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.396
You have an interview here?

10:39.238 --> 10:42.537
I'm having a hard time
picturing you working here.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.652
I thought you said
the interview was at 3.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.527
Good luck!

11:15.841 --> 11:19.208
After Mom left,
Charlie helped me

11:19.278 --> 11:21.746
with my class projects.

11:21.847 --> 11:27.683
He did his best, but things
changed for me at school.

11:27.753 --> 11:31.052
He had his own ideas
about science and history.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.250
When the teachers
disagreed with those ideas,

11:33.359 --> 11:35.725
he always told them
they could look it up.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.387
You think they're
going to like it?

11:37.463 --> 11:38.953
They're going to love it.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.625
- Think so?
- I know so.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.564
You have a good day,
sweetie.

11:44.637 --> 11:45.797
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.132
Good, very nice, Ron.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.300
That's fine.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.778
Who are the little people, Miranda?

11:57.883 --> 12:00.374
Those are the bodies
of the Chumash Indians

12:00.453 --> 12:02.887
who died of syphilis
and influenza,

12:02.955 --> 12:06.254
infected by the missionaries.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.123
Uh, Miranda,
go out in the hallway

12:09.228 --> 12:11.389
and wait for me
out there.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.453
Go on.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.563
I don't understand.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.969
We're not having
any interviews.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.268
We're not hiring now.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.009
Okay, sorry.
Thanks.

12:27.113 --> 12:30.742
Proceed to route.

12:30.816 --> 12:35.014
- Left turn in two miles.
- Charlie!

12:35.121 --> 12:36.520
- Goodbye.
- Shit, Charlie...

12:36.622 --> 12:38.351
Hey, Miranda. Hi.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.583
Where did you go?

12:39.658 --> 12:41.250
Just, you know,
walking around,

12:41.327 --> 12:42.851
checking
the neighborhood out.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.795
What about the job?

12:45.865 --> 12:49.096
You know why people
like to eat in this place?

12:49.168 --> 12:51.830
Fear of the unknown.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.098
Nothing in there
surprises them.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.471
Why do you feel like
you have to make stuff up?

12:56.542 --> 12:58.669
I mean, so you're not
looking for a job.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.643
You just want to go,
I don't know,

13:00.713 --> 13:02.010
explore or something.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.376
That's fine, whatever.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.643
I mean, it would be great
if you got a job.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.481
I was barely scraping by
when it was just me...

13:07.553 --> 13:08.645
Pull over there.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.382
You have arrived.

13:10.489 --> 13:12.855
You know what, no.
I just wasted half my afternoon.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.016
Please, just pull in right over there.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.152
No, I'm not letting you
out of this car.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.526
Miranda, I gotta go.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.690
What are you talking about?
What is this all about?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.358
- Just tell me what you're doing.
- It's embarrassing, okay?

13:22.468 --> 13:25.960
I take these medications.
I gotta do pit stops all the time.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.196
Yeah. I'm sorry.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.580
Can you back up to the bushes?

13:47.993 --> 13:53.397
When possible, make the first
available legal U-turn.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.093
Charlie?

15:39.872 --> 15:42.033
Ow! Shit!

15:42.141 --> 15:45.042
Charlie? You okay?

15:45.144 --> 15:46.975
I'm fine.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.877
Stop! Stop!

15:48.981 --> 15:50.278
God...

15:50.349 --> 15:53.147
What are you doing?
Do you have to do this right now?

15:53.218 --> 15:55.277
The stars are
in a perfect position.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.049
They won't be like this
for another year.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.287
I can't stop you, can I?

16:05.831 --> 16:08.698
Work your magic.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.210
Oh, yeah, that's it,
the northerly declination

16:20.312 --> 16:21.506
from Sirius the Dog Star.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.047
That's my baby!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.986
This is it.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.655
This is what?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.263
What're you doing?

16:43.369 --> 16:44.529
Come on, let's go.

16:44.603 --> 16:45.592
Come on.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.008
Oh, come on.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.688
Come on,
I'll give you a boost.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.753
Come here.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.571
Just so you know,
I have to be at work

17:25.644 --> 17:27.202
in, like, seven hours.

17:27.279 --> 17:30.112
Relax.
You'll be there.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.610
Miranda...

17:35.721 --> 17:38.747
meet the Excalibur 1000.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.091
Is that a metal detector?

17:51.737 --> 17:52.999
Now you hear that?

17:53.105 --> 17:56.097
That's maybe tin foil or nickel.

17:56.175 --> 17:59.633
Nickels and tin foil
make that low tone.

17:59.745 --> 18:04.011
We call that the fool's gold
of modern prospecting.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.140
Prospecting?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.945
Yeah.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.687
High tone,
could be silver.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.089
Silver is a great conductor.

18:22.468 --> 18:25.266
Must be one
of the old quarters.

18:25.337 --> 18:27.862
The new ones,
they don't have much silver in them.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.107
We are well on our way
to paying off the Visa.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.307
You know, Charlie,
the manual says

18:37.382 --> 18:38.872
you can plug headphones
into that thing,

18:38.984 --> 18:41.043
so why don't you do that
so that we don't get popped?

18:41.153 --> 18:43.383
No, then you wouldn't
get to hear it

18:43.489 --> 18:44.478
when it makes a noise.

18:48.861 --> 18:49.850
Huh!

18:55.801 --> 18:57.166
Get the shovel!

18:57.236 --> 18:59.033
- We have a shovel?
- It's in the bag!

18:59.138 --> 19:02.005
I'm am out of here.
We're going to get busted.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.666
We're not doing
anything illegal.

19:03.742 --> 19:04.868
This is public land.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.205
There's gotta be
something illegal about...

19:06.311 --> 19:07.869
You are so lame,
Miranda.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.210
I can't believe I raised
such a law-abiding citizen.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.748
Oh, you raised me?

19:11.850 --> 19:15.377
Of course,
the highest tone

19:15.487 --> 19:18.888
is for the best conductor of them all.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.180
Eureka.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.016
Can we go now?

19:50.088 --> 19:54.286
Don't you want to
even know what this is?

19:55.794 --> 19:57.728
Okay.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.458
What is it?

20:00.566 --> 20:03.865
This is a doubloon.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.028
A what?

20:05.103 --> 20:09.870
A doubloon
from the 17th century.

20:14.279 --> 20:18.045
The diary of Father
Juan Florismartes Torres,

20:18.116 --> 20:21.108
1651.

20:21.220 --> 20:26.055
So, I picked up this book
in the hospital library

20:26.124 --> 20:27.557
and it got me thinking.

20:27.626 --> 20:29.389
I thought the whole idea
behind the hospital

20:29.461 --> 20:31.258
was for you
to stop thinking.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.127
And I got some other books.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.393
More books, eh?

20:36.668 --> 20:42.072
Along with a gold crucifix
and the statue of the Virgin,

20:42.140 --> 20:47.806
Father Torres' expedition
had a cache of gold doubloons.

20:47.913 --> 20:52.646
Now, these doubloons were dated.

20:54.486 --> 20:58.286
This one...
it's hard to see.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.815
Something...
Something, 1624.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.451
Let me see.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.496
That's 24 carats.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.970
Records that I obtained from
the Spanish Treasury indicate...

21:18.043 --> 21:19.203
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.370
How the hell
did you obtain records

21:21.480 --> 21:23.710
from the Spanish Treasury
from a mental institution?

21:23.815 --> 21:24.804
The internet.

21:24.883 --> 21:26.874
- Perfect.
- No, I'll show you.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.111
Here.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.659
See for yourself.

21:38.730 --> 21:42.166
Father Torres' doubloons
were dated.

21:42.234 --> 21:45.863
Now, coins minted in 1624
were allocated

21:45.971 --> 21:47.905
for what we call now,
you know, "petty cash,"

21:48.006 --> 21:50.065
which Torres lost sooner.

21:50.175 --> 21:53.235
Nobody else was around back then,
so it's gotta be his.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.142
Now based upon
where we found this

21:55.213 --> 21:57.238
and the reports of
the underground cave system...

21:57.349 --> 21:59.180
- Cave system?
- Right. Right.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.014
So all we gotta do
is follow this journal

22:01.086 --> 22:04.055
and it's going to lead us
to the treasure.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.524
It's just...
It's waiting to be found.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.555
You're serious.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.892
Yeah.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.194
Look, a lot of people
must've read this journal.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.025
How come nobody ever found
the treasure before?

22:18.103 --> 22:20.401
They've tried!
I mean, lots of people have tried.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.370
It's been well documented,
all right?

22:22.441 --> 22:23.533
I've read all of them.

22:23.608 --> 22:26.008
- I marked chapters for you.
- Oh, Charlie.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.842
The thing is that nobody realized how special

22:28.914 --> 22:30.245
this Father Torres was.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.841
Nobody ever went and looked
into his background!

22:35.187 --> 22:38.782
Charlie, these people
all look like idiots.

22:45.564 --> 22:46.724
I'm going to go to bed.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.130
- Miranda...
- You're freaking me out.

22:49.234 --> 22:50.462
Okay?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.582
I'm not decent.

23:06.651 --> 23:07.811
Come on, Miranda.
Open up.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.895
Sometimes I wake up and...
and I don't know if I'm me.

23:17.963 --> 23:20.090
That's why you take
your medication.

23:20.165 --> 23:21.826
No, it's not that.
I'm me. I know that.

23:21.933 --> 23:26.336
What I'm saying is that...
I don't know if I exist.

23:26.438 --> 23:28.235
- Oh.
- Come on, listen...

23:28.306 --> 23:30.171
No, I... I'm listening.
You're not sure you exist.

23:30.275 --> 23:32.072
- And?
- I've done a lot of things in my life.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.271
But maybe I haven't
done what I need to do.

23:34.346 --> 23:38.840
And if I do this,
maybe I will.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.281
Exist?

23:40.352 --> 23:41.580
Yeah.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.747
You're shaking.
You need something to eat.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.850
Read the book.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.188
This is so stupid.

23:50.295 --> 23:51.819
Please?

23:55.467 --> 23:57.458
All right, I'll read it
if you eat something.

24:06.678 --> 24:08.009
This is for you.

24:21.326 --> 24:24.784
Parents have this advantage over us.

24:24.863 --> 24:27.388
We want to believe in them.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.694
And when we don't
believe in them,

24:29.801 --> 24:32.634
we still just want
to be with them.

24:49.921 --> 24:50.910
Hey, Padre!

24:51.022 --> 24:52.046
As a young man,

24:52.157 --> 24:54.387
Torres was a mathematics scholar in Seville.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.686
In fact, it looks like he might've
been sent to the New World

24:58.763 --> 25:01.732
because certain of his ideas
were considered heretical.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.739
But that's not
what's important.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.400
The thing that matters here
is that he was more accustomed

25:11.510 --> 25:15.276
to communicating
with numbers than words.

25:15.380 --> 25:17.211
So then, it dawned
on me one night,

25:17.282 --> 25:19.375
while the other patients
were watching JAG.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.748
They like that in there?

25:20.852 --> 25:22.513
- They love it.
- Oh.

25:22.587 --> 25:25.522
Anyway, I noticed that some
of the passages repeated themselves.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.683
I read the book again,
and sure enough they did.

25:27.759 --> 25:31.058
So I began to wonder, why would
somebody in the middle of nowhere

25:31.129 --> 25:34.064
presumably with a limited
supply of pen and ink

25:34.132 --> 25:35.565
repeat themselves like that?

25:35.634 --> 25:37.226
Senility?

25:37.302 --> 25:40.066
He was writing in code.

25:40.138 --> 25:42.538
Took me a long time,
but I finally broke it.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.244
I gotta go.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.404
See, I transposed
Padre Torres' description

26:20.478 --> 26:23.072
and found the area he was
in was exactly seven leagues

26:23.148 --> 26:24.740
to the north of where
he said he was.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.340
It's simple, really.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.939
Charlie believed
the doubloon had been dropped

26:49.007 --> 26:50.941
when Father Torres'
expedition was robbed

26:51.009 --> 26:53.477
and half of his party
was massacred.

26:53.545 --> 26:56.139
He thought that Torres
had headed northwest after that,

26:56.214 --> 26:58.705
and that we were following
the same route.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.680
"Journal of Father
Juan Florismartes Torres,

27:04.789 --> 27:10.284
"18th of October,
the year of our Lord 1624.

27:10.362 --> 27:14.492
"As we reached the summit and look
down into the valley of Santa Clarita,

27:14.566 --> 27:17.057
"there unfolded before us
was as beautiful a picture

27:17.168 --> 27:19.796
"as one ever looked upon.

27:19.871 --> 27:24.035
"We saw a large green meadow
of thousands of acres, more or less,

27:24.142 --> 27:26.633
"its north side bounded
by low mountains at the base

27:26.711 --> 27:29.703
"which oak trees
were plentiful.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.248
"It was like a grand old park,

27:32.350 --> 27:35.547
"such as we read of
in fairy tales.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.849
"We passed that night
under some large trees

27:37.922 --> 27:39.321
"whose branches
went over our heads

27:39.391 --> 27:40.824
"as beautifully
as the ceilings

27:40.892 --> 27:43.884
"in our finest cathedrals.

27:43.995 --> 27:47.396
"Upon our safe arrival, we offered
the sacrament on a large rock

27:47.499 --> 27:51.230
"that seemed almost to have
been fashioned for that holy purpose.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.894
"I bade the smith
use his chisel

27:53.004 --> 27:56.269
"to carve the three crosses
of Golgotha into the stone.

28:01.179 --> 28:05.707
You have arrived
at your destination.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.684
This is it.

28:07.752 --> 28:09.549
- It might be.
- No, it is! It is!

28:09.621 --> 28:11.612
Look how old these trees are.

28:14.292 --> 28:15.759
All right.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.294
So obviously, it's going
to be worn down, right?

28:18.396 --> 28:21.627
I mean, you know,
it's more than 300 years old.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.530
Uh!

28:23.601 --> 28:24.932
Damn!

28:26.404 --> 28:27.735
C- Come here, come here.

28:27.806 --> 28:29.774
- See this?
- What?

28:29.874 --> 28:31.739
This is it.

28:31.810 --> 28:32.936
Look at that.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.739
Look! Look!

28:36.448 --> 28:37.437
I don't know.
It might be.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.483
It is!
That's it!

28:39.584 --> 28:42.314
The rock must've moved.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.650
Well, it could be
an earthquake.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.486
Wait a minute.

28:51.596 --> 28:52.585
Wait a minute.
Look!

28:52.664 --> 28:54.791
I think I see it, right there!

28:54.899 --> 28:56.230
I see it. Look!
Yeah, they're upside-down.

28:56.301 --> 28:57.996
That's why I didn't
recognize them at first.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.166
Can I help you?

29:02.507 --> 29:03.906
I think it's time to go.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.567
Why do they always say,
"Can I help you?"

29:05.643 --> 29:07.235
When it's the last thing
they want to do?

29:07.312 --> 29:08.301
Sir?

29:08.413 --> 29:09.402
And they say "sir"
and "ma'am"

29:09.481 --> 29:10.846
like they want
to show some respect.

29:10.949 --> 29:12.075
- It's monstrous.
- Charlie.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.481
- Sir!
- Yes.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.281
Are you a member
here at La Cresta?

29:18.356 --> 29:19.687
Are you shitting me?

29:19.791 --> 29:21.486
Then I'll have to
ask you to leave.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.527
- Are you happy?
- Sir?

29:23.628 --> 29:25.926
- Charlie.
- All I want to know is are you happy?

29:25.997 --> 29:26.986
Sir.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.963
- Is this man your father?
- Yeah.

29:29.033 --> 29:32.867
Just wanted to see
your eyes.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.997
I couldn't tell
what color they were.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.200
A first, I thought
they were brown.

29:38.309 --> 29:42.006
Now they're looking
very green.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.775
Must be the foliage.

29:44.849 --> 29:47.818
They are so beautiful.

29:50.889 --> 29:51.981
They're hazel.

29:54.392 --> 29:56.292
Hazel.

29:59.998 --> 30:04.731
Well, I'm so sorry that I
caused you any problems.

30:05.904 --> 30:09.067
But... I'll be on my way.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.546
I can't believe you just gave
that cop our phone number.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.673
I hope she calls me.
She's a peach.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.012
Once you get
that flack vest off,

30:20.084 --> 30:21.073
she'd be something else.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.552
Oh, God.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.685
Let's just say this gold does exist.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.887
What are you going to do
with it after you get it?

30:30.995 --> 30:32.895
Wouldn't we have to give it
to a museum or something?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.555
Not necessarily.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.601
I know a lot of people who want
to buy it if we wanted to sell it,

30:37.702 --> 30:39.727
but you're missing the point.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.827
What's that?

30:40.905 --> 30:42.668
I don't want the money.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.709
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have to work for it.

30:45.777 --> 30:48.371
Well, define work.

31:26.317 --> 31:27.875
People walk around all day,

31:27.952 --> 31:30.113
sure that they're going
to win the lottery.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.553
I've always thought
that was crazy.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.717
Ten more minutes, Randy.

31:34.792 --> 31:36.885
My name is Miranda.

31:36.961 --> 31:40.488
At least Charlie had a plan.

31:40.598 --> 31:44.762
I mean, who doesn't
want to believe in buried treasure?

32:00.151 --> 32:04.178
Still, maybe I shouldn't
have encouraged him.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.982
"From the journal
of Father Torres,

32:38.056 --> 32:41.719
"November 21st, 1624.

32:41.826 --> 32:44.886
"The natives appear to be
a simple, good-natured,

32:44.996 --> 32:46.861
"stupid race of people,

32:46.965 --> 32:49.661
"and in most respects
resemble the savages we find

32:49.734 --> 32:52.635
"in other newly-discovered countries.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.332
"There was no sign
of aggression at first,

32:55.406 --> 32:57.636
"until one of the soldiers
who'd come into our mission

32:57.709 --> 32:59.506
"was inspired to the act
of seduction,

32:59.577 --> 33:02.705
"the object being
a young female.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.179
"An action
unfathomable to me

33:04.248 --> 33:08.309
"as the females are uniformly
unpleasant of aspect.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.479
"Considerable uproar ensued
and we were forced

33:10.555 --> 33:14.321
to retreat inland,
following the river upstream."

33:17.562 --> 33:19.860
After they carved
the crosses on the rock,

33:19.931 --> 33:21.558
Father Torres' expedition
had followed

33:21.666 --> 33:23.497
the Santa Clarita River.

33:23.568 --> 33:27.595
The thing was there wasn't
a Santa Clarita River anymore.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.071
It had been dammed
and diverted.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.039
But Charlie thought
that his calculations

33:32.110 --> 33:35.102
would lead us to where
the river used to flow.

33:35.213 --> 33:38.046
He said I can look it up
if I didn't believe him.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.944
What do I say?

33:47.592 --> 33:49.116
You don't have to say anything.

33:49.227 --> 33:52.128
We've got every right
to be here.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.425
Thanks for the tip!

34:00.304 --> 34:01.896
You got a 302 in there?

34:01.973 --> 34:03.440
What?

34:03.541 --> 34:05.065
Does that have a 302 in it?

34:05.143 --> 34:06.303
What?

34:06.411 --> 34:07.400
The backhoe.

34:07.478 --> 34:10.311
Oh, that.
Yeah, yeah.

34:10.415 --> 34:13.873
It's a power plant,
that 302, for its size.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.885
It sure is.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.054
Ha ha!

34:21.125 --> 34:23.491
Ah! Jesus Christ!

34:23.594 --> 34:25.425
Pottery shards!
Ha ha!

34:25.496 --> 34:28.226
Will you excuse me?
I'll catch you later.

34:28.299 --> 34:29.891
Right on.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.402
Broken water jugs,

34:35.473 --> 34:37.907
exactly the same kind
the expedition would've used!

34:37.975 --> 34:40.136
And look, it's even got
curved sides.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.938
Okay, well, shouldn't
we take them to somebody

34:42.013 --> 34:43.241
like an archeologist
or something?

34:43.313 --> 34:44.975
What, have them
spoil everything?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.347
No, they can do that...
that thing, that radio...

34:47.452 --> 34:48.418
- Radio carbon dating, yeah.
- Yeah.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.848
That's been discredited
a long time ago.

34:51.956 --> 34:55.016
"In questions of science
the analysis of a thousand

34:55.126 --> 34:58.687
is not worth the humble reasoning
of a single individual!"

34:58.796 --> 34:59.854
Galileo!

35:01.432 --> 35:04.833
Miranda, just feel this.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.336
Put that in your hands.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.872
Feel how old that is.

35:14.479 --> 35:15.878
Charlie believed
that if we followed

35:15.980 --> 35:18.471
the original riverbed,
we would locate the cavern

35:18.549 --> 35:19.675
where Father Torres
and his men

35:19.784 --> 35:22.947
had been forced
to abandon their gold.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.682
But there was one obstacle.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.225
49.2 degrees north.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.360
This is the way.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.700
Hi. Uh, do you have
your card?

35:41.806 --> 35:43.330
Oh, we're just browsing.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.048
What I need you to do...

35:52.150 --> 35:56.678
I want you to take
this out 67 feet.

35:58.222 --> 35:59.314
Please?

36:20.545 --> 36:22.274
Don't touch that!

36:22.380 --> 36:24.848
Don't...
Oh, Jesus Christ.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.042
I'm so close.

36:26.117 --> 36:28.278
- Excuse me, sir.
- What?

36:28.386 --> 36:30.718
Pardon me, but I didn't know
we really carried these.

36:30.788 --> 36:33.222
These? You guys
got everything in here.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.589
Yeah, we sure do.
Is it working out for you?

36:35.693 --> 36:37.957
- It's working out fine. It's fine.
- Okay.

36:38.062 --> 36:41.190
All right, well...
Okay. All right.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.270
Okay.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.536
All right.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.409
I'll just get this...

36:56.480 --> 36:58.573
- Okay.
- Sighs]

36:58.649 --> 37:00.583
Can you hold this, please?

37:02.820 --> 37:04.151
This is plugged.

37:04.255 --> 37:05.882
This over here.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.050
24 degrees.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.615
And that's it.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.494
X marks the spot.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.398
This is so wild.

37:23.474 --> 37:25.669
Doubloons from
the King of Spain,

37:25.776 --> 37:27.107
lost more than
300 years ago

37:27.178 --> 37:29.942
and they're buried
under a Costco?

37:30.014 --> 37:32.414
Well, I guess you know
it wasn't meant to be.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.111
It's only 6 feet down.

37:36.787 --> 37:38.311
Only 6 feet?

37:38.422 --> 37:39.787
M- Maybe 7.

37:39.857 --> 37:42.018
It'll take two
highly-motivated individuals

37:42.126 --> 37:43.593
maybe fours hours
with the right equipment.

37:43.661 --> 37:46.289
Are you nuts?

37:46.364 --> 37:49.094
I'm sorry, but can we be realistic here?

37:49.166 --> 37:50.690
I'm being realistic.
There's no problem here.

37:50.801 --> 37:53.269
- I'll lay it out.
- No, forget it, Charlie.

37:53.337 --> 37:54.634
No way.

37:54.705 --> 37:56.297
- You did your best.
- No, no, no, no!

37:56.374 --> 37:59.468
I'm not going to be beaten
by a few layers of concrete!

37:59.543 --> 38:01.340
No, sir!
Not on my watch!

38:01.445 --> 38:03.538
Hey, take it easy.

38:56.434 --> 38:59.198
Mom was a hand model,

38:59.270 --> 39:03.707
a job held by adult women
with eerily childlike hands.

39:03.774 --> 39:05.537
Which you don't
come across every day,

39:05.609 --> 39:07.236
so they get paid pretty well.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.711
Cut. Great.
That's a wrap.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.839
She was careful.

39:11.916 --> 39:13.508
She had to be.

39:13.584 --> 39:16.246
Her hands were the only income
we had for a while.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.515
Don't you touch my hands!

39:22.093 --> 39:25.392
After she left, it was just me and Charlie.

39:27.765 --> 39:30.233
Things were a lot more
exciting then.

39:32.403 --> 39:33.961
Like an adventure.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.901
But the supply of toys dwindled.

39:41.145 --> 39:43.045
We managed, though.

39:55.893 --> 39:59.488
I don't know why anybody would
want to buy one of these things.

40:01.565 --> 40:06.127
It's not as if it's so hard
to wash dishes by hand

40:06.237 --> 40:08.467
the old-fashioned way.

40:40.538 --> 40:41.971
Ooh!

40:57.288 --> 40:58.482
Morning.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.354
You...

41:02.560 --> 41:04.391
Uh, Miranda?

41:19.043 --> 41:20.169
What happened to my car?

41:20.244 --> 41:21.506
Miranda...

41:21.579 --> 41:22.910
Did you wreck it?

41:24.815 --> 41:26.806
I couldn't pay the rental
on the backhoe.

41:26.884 --> 41:27.873
No way.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.715
So, your car
was a necessary sacrifice.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.721
But we're almost there,
Miranda.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.552
We are so close.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.717
Jesus Christ.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.059
I'm sorry, I...

41:41.165 --> 41:43.998
I'm really sorry.
I just wasn't thinking.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.160
You never do.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.397
Well, I'll get it back.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.598
- How are you going to do that?
- I don't know.

41:49.707 --> 41:50.696
But I will.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.332
Well, I guess I'd better
get a move on

41:52.409 --> 41:54.172
since I'm going
to have to take the bus.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.042
Can't you get a friend
to give you a ride?

41:56.113 --> 41:58.946
I don't have any friends.

41:59.049 --> 42:02.849
What about that skinny one
who only eats carrots?

42:02.920 --> 42:04.182
Carrots-and-Mountain Dew-Julia?

42:04.255 --> 42:05.745
Right, Julia,
carrots, right.

42:05.856 --> 42:06.880
She had an eating disorder.

42:06.957 --> 42:09.585
She went to the hospital
and died.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.217
Oh.

42:11.295 --> 42:13.855
Well, in that case, maybe I can
go back down and get the car.

42:13.931 --> 42:15.057
I'm sure he hasn't
sold it yet.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.100
It wasn't that the car
was in such great shape.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.431
- I'm sure the car...
- Stop! Stop!

42:19.537 --> 42:20.936
I loved that car.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.733
I know you did.

42:22.806 --> 42:24.569
No, you didn't
because I never told you.

42:24.642 --> 42:26.041
Why? Because you never listen.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.943
All right, I'm an asshole.
That has been established.

42:29.046 --> 42:32.413
Not to the extent that
I'm about to establish it.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.418
You make fun of everything
I do, including my job.

42:35.486 --> 42:37.044
No, I'm proud of you working.

42:37.121 --> 42:38.281
Don't... Yeah, right.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.981
You know, I'm the one
that's paying the bills.

42:40.090 --> 42:42.615
No, it's wild.
Isn't it?

42:43.827 --> 42:46.057
You don't take anything seriously, do you?

42:46.130 --> 42:48.963
You think the world
is just here for your amusement.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.159
- Look at the world.
- I do.

42:51.268 --> 42:54.135
But unlike you,
I have to live in it.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.071
I just...
I don't understand.

42:57.141 --> 42:58.506
You're a really smart guy.

42:58.609 --> 43:01.942
How can you keep
doing this year after year?

43:02.012 --> 43:04.742
What do you mean?

43:04.815 --> 43:08.273
The treasure is just like
all your jazz combos, Charlie.

43:08.352 --> 43:10.411
Just like the tour boat
that sank,

43:10.487 --> 43:13.479
just like the Mexican
holistic medical degree,

43:13.591 --> 43:15.855
just like your marriage.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.825
How come you can't
see that?

43:17.928 --> 43:21.329
Everybody else can.

43:21.432 --> 43:24.162
There's something
really wrong with you.

43:32.209 --> 43:35.440
I can't believe
you sold my fucking car!

43:35.512 --> 43:36.706
And now... Oh.

43:38.482 --> 43:43.385
And now, I give you
Orange Grove Estates' 1,000th family.

43:43.487 --> 43:45.182
Let's give them a hand.

45:05.469 --> 45:10.236
# Oh, my home #

45:10.307 --> 45:14.471
# Is just floating all away #

45:14.578 --> 45:17.638
# My dreams #

45:17.748 --> 45:20.774
# Take to the road #

45:20.884 --> 45:25.287
# As I try to stay afloat #

45:25.389 --> 45:27.448
# In this flood #

45:27.558 --> 45:33.463
# And this flood of dreams #

45:33.564 --> 45:35.464
Welcome to McDonald's.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.727
# When you were mine #

45:37.801 --> 45:41.066
# The sky was so high #

45:41.138 --> 45:44.403
# The forests were green #

45:44.475 --> 45:49.469
# And the stars were bright #

45:49.580 --> 45:53.072
# Now I've got the road #

45:53.150 --> 45:58.782
# Leading me off
cleverly... #

45:58.856 --> 45:59.948
Have a good day, sweetie

46:00.023 --> 46:01.012
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:02.793 --> 46:07.355
# Oh, my home #

46:07.464 --> 46:11.423
# Is floating all away #

46:11.502 --> 46:14.630
# My dreams #

47:17.768 --> 47:21.932
After he found his bass again
in that pawn shop in Atlanta,

47:22.039 --> 47:26.942
Charlie swore
he'd never pawn it again.

47:27.044 --> 47:28.773
He swore he'd pawn
his own mother

47:28.879 --> 47:31.177
before he'd pawn that bass.

48:05.415 --> 48:09.044
Charlie.

48:09.119 --> 48:11.747
- Charlie.
- Snorts]

48:26.670 --> 48:28.228
Have you eaten anything?

48:28.305 --> 48:31.240
Uh...

48:31.308 --> 48:32.798
No.

48:32.910 --> 48:36.141
- I'll go make something.
- Oh, no, it's cool. It's cool.

48:37.481 --> 48:38.971
Why don't you sit down?

48:43.754 --> 48:47.087
Used to look out here,
you'd see one,

48:47.157 --> 48:49.990
maybe two lights.

48:50.093 --> 48:55.030
Your mom, she used to complain
all the time about being

48:55.132 --> 48:56.531
in the middle of nowhere.

49:00.671 --> 49:02.036
It's still the middle of nowhere.

49:02.139 --> 49:06.633
There's just a lot more people in it now.

49:12.316 --> 49:14.375
You didn't have to sell
your bass and records.

49:16.820 --> 49:20.347
You just have to know
when to give up.

49:20.457 --> 49:22.857
Dad, don't.

49:25.896 --> 49:29.195
I told you,
I'm finished with music.

49:32.569 --> 49:35.367
That's not what
I'm talking about.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.645
Um, excuse me.

49:48.719 --> 49:51.051
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:51.154 --> 49:52.815
Would you like to try
some chowder?

49:55.592 --> 49:58.220
So let's hear it.

49:58.328 --> 49:59.852
Okay, well, a lot of the doors

49:59.930 --> 50:02.831
claim to be alarmed
but they're not.

50:02.899 --> 50:05.060
How do you know?

50:05.168 --> 50:06.726
I opened them.

50:06.837 --> 50:07.997
Well, that's fine.

50:08.071 --> 50:10.596
We'll make a good scofflaw
out of you yet.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.121
Most of the people are really nice.

50:31.228 --> 50:32.889
Everyone says I could be looking at a raise

50:32.963 --> 50:34.863
within six months,
and the benefits are great.

50:34.931 --> 50:36.899
Hold on, here. Let's focus.

50:36.967 --> 50:39.026
Tell me about
the security guards.

50:39.102 --> 50:40.899
They have two of them.

50:40.971 --> 50:42.029
They only work in the daytime.

50:42.105 --> 50:43.367
Come on, come on!

50:43.440 --> 50:45.465
One of them is named Mike.

50:45.575 --> 50:48.237
And the other one
is named Bruce.

50:48.311 --> 50:51.075
Security guards
have master keys,

50:51.148 --> 50:53.378
but the manager,
he's the only one

50:53.450 --> 50:55.884
who has the great
grand master key.

50:55.952 --> 50:58.580
It opens every single door.

50:58.655 --> 51:00.054
He calls it the "God" key.

51:00.123 --> 51:01.886
I think you're doing great,
by the way.

51:01.958 --> 51:03.425
Thanks.

51:03.493 --> 51:07.452
Kelly and I sometimes head
out to the beach on Saturdays.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.930
We have a little barbecue,
play a little volleyball.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.900
Nah, you play volleyball.

51:11.968 --> 51:14.630
I just listen to Jimmy Buffet
and soak up the rays.

51:14.738 --> 51:17.229
I'm a total parrothead.

51:17.307 --> 51:18.501
Do you like the beach,
Miranda?

51:20.310 --> 51:22.403
I can't even remember
the last time I went to the beach.

51:22.479 --> 51:24.640
I bet you'd look great
in a bikini.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.238
Miranda.

51:26.316 --> 51:28.409
What? Let me finish the story.

51:28.485 --> 51:31.010
Did you...

51:31.121 --> 51:33.749
Did you get sort of
a weird vibe

51:33.824 --> 51:36.418
from these people?

51:36.493 --> 51:38.586
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

51:38.662 --> 51:40.926
That's because they're swingers.

51:40.997 --> 51:43.295
What?

51:43.366 --> 51:45.357
Do I gotta draw you
a picture?

51:45.469 --> 51:47.699
What are you
talking about?

51:47.804 --> 51:49.635
- You don't know, do you?
- No.

51:49.706 --> 51:54.040
So nice that you don't
know everything.

51:54.144 --> 51:56.544
Swingers, um...

51:56.646 --> 51:59.547
Well, they're, you know,
people who like

51:59.649 --> 52:02.812
to spice up their life
with different partners.

52:04.554 --> 52:05.543
Oh!

52:05.655 --> 52:07.987
Oh, my God.

52:08.058 --> 52:10.856
They were talking
swinger code.

52:10.961 --> 52:13.953
Oh, God,
that is so gross!

52:14.030 --> 52:15.224
What am I going to do?

52:15.332 --> 52:16.731
Why? Wh-What's the matter?

52:16.833 --> 52:19.666
- They invited me to a barbecue.
- They what?

52:19.736 --> 52:22.068
You were the one that told me
to accept any and all invitations

52:22.172 --> 52:24.197
so that I can get to know
the people and the layout.

52:24.307 --> 52:26.207
But I didn't mean that
you were supposed to go and...

52:26.309 --> 52:27.867
I didn't know that
they were swingers.

52:27.978 --> 52:30.139
It's cool, all right?
It's cool, it's cool.

52:30.213 --> 52:32.306
Y- You just...
You don't have to go.

52:32.382 --> 52:33.906
I told them that I would,
and, you know,

52:34.017 --> 52:35.712
I thought I could maybe
get at Doug's keys.

52:35.819 --> 52:37.252
The God key.

52:37.354 --> 52:39.914
- Yeah.
- Mm.

52:40.023 --> 52:42.048
No, no. We...
We can't do this.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.719
I think I can take care of myself, Charlie;
I've had a lot of practice.

52:44.828 --> 52:48.389
You know, sometimes
I just wish you'd call me "Dad."

52:48.498 --> 52:50.591
Okay, I can take care
of myself, Dad.

52:50.700 --> 52:53.669
Thank you. I mean, you're what,
18 years old now?

52:53.737 --> 52:55.568
I'll be 17 in 3 weeks.

52:57.207 --> 53:01.200
You're gonna be 17?
I gotta write this down, man.

53:01.278 --> 53:03.269
You are so young.

53:03.380 --> 53:04.574
But, you know,
you act so old.

53:04.681 --> 53:05.670
Sometimes you're very, um...

53:05.749 --> 53:07.376
- Precocious?
- Precocious, yes.

53:07.450 --> 53:10.283
Now, I forbid you
to go to this barbecue.

53:10.387 --> 53:11.911
You hear me?

53:12.022 --> 53:13.011
Okay, I won't.

53:13.089 --> 53:14.351
Are you going
to promise me that?

53:14.424 --> 53:16.085
Okay. God.

53:35.979 --> 53:38.743
# See the curtains
hanging in the window #

53:38.815 --> 53:44.082
# In the evening
on a Friday night #

53:44.154 --> 53:46.918
# A little light shining
through the window #

53:46.990 --> 53:52.428
# Lets me know
everything's all right #

53:52.495 --> 53:57.455
# Summer breeze
makes me feel fine #

53:57.567 --> 54:02.504
# Blowing through
the jasmine in my mind #

54:02.606 --> 54:05.837
One of the perks
of the management position:

54:05.942 --> 54:08.274
Half price on all seafood.

54:08.345 --> 54:10.074
Have some before
it's all spoiled.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.573
It's a virgin,
by the way.

54:14.651 --> 54:16.084
Berry flavored.

54:18.622 --> 54:19.919
Miranda, did you bring
your bathing suit?

54:19.990 --> 54:23.084
No. Why?

54:23.159 --> 54:24.649
You don't have
a swimming pool, right?

54:24.761 --> 54:26.592
Hot tub.

54:27.831 --> 54:31.096
- Huh. Um...
- Dude! Dude!

54:31.167 --> 54:32.691
We need some more chairs!

54:32.802 --> 54:35.600
Okay, Leonid.
Just a sec.

54:35.672 --> 54:37.469
Excuse me, ladies.

54:37.540 --> 54:40.338
Hey, so do you want to go
check out my suits?

54:40.443 --> 54:41.842
I've got a major selection.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.310
Huh?

54:43.380 --> 54:45.871
I mean, we look
like we're about the same size, huh?

54:45.982 --> 54:48.041
Uh, I think I'm...

54:48.151 --> 54:50.619
I'm sorry, I think I'm going
to have to pass on the hot tub.

54:50.687 --> 54:52.211
Are you sure?

54:52.322 --> 54:54.051
It'd be really nice.

54:54.157 --> 54:56.887
That water's, like,
fruit scented.

54:56.993 --> 54:58.790
It's pineapple...

55:00.997 --> 55:05.491
# Summer breeze
makes me feel fine #

55:05.568 --> 55:11.165
# Blowing through
the jasmine in my mind #

55:15.312 --> 55:17.576
Actually, I changed my mind.
The hot tub sounds good.

55:17.681 --> 55:21.481
It does, doesn't it?
All right, come on.

55:24.654 --> 55:28.556
So, I'm guessing
a G-string is out.

55:28.658 --> 55:30.216
What?

55:30.327 --> 55:33.228
Wait, I got the perfect thong.

55:36.900 --> 55:39.767
- A thong?
- What? Oh, no, no.

55:39.869 --> 55:41.393
- Look at this.
- No, no, no.

55:41.504 --> 55:43.165
All right.

55:43.239 --> 55:44.934
- I got it!
- Oh!

55:51.181 --> 55:53.342
- Parrots?
- Oh.

55:53.416 --> 55:55.714
Check it out.
Look at that.

55:55.785 --> 55:58.447
No? Okay.
One more.

56:02.692 --> 56:06.253
Okay, I hope you dig this.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.422
Dude!

56:08.531 --> 56:11.694
Check it out.
Look at this.

56:11.768 --> 56:15.363
Oh, hey, it's all right.

56:15.438 --> 56:18.066
Are you sure
this is a virgin?

56:19.376 --> 56:22.470
Oh, boy.

56:27.083 --> 56:29.483
You know, um,
there's this...

56:29.586 --> 56:30.985
Oh, Christ.

56:31.087 --> 56:32.486
- Oh, okay.
- I'm so sorry.

56:54.577 --> 56:56.568
- Hi.
- Hey.

56:56.646 --> 56:58.910
- What's happening?
- Ugh.

57:01.017 --> 57:06.148
So, um... look
what I got for you.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.521
One with your own name on it.

57:09.626 --> 57:11.685
Good. Great.

57:11.795 --> 57:13.126
No.

57:13.196 --> 57:14.663
Come on, your credit rating is great.

57:14.764 --> 57:17.528
No, Charlie. No.

57:17.634 --> 57:19.499
You all right?

57:19.602 --> 57:21.536
Yeah, I'm fine.

57:21.638 --> 57:24.038
So, Pepper here,
he used to work

57:24.140 --> 57:27.200
for an alarm service
company.

57:27.310 --> 57:29.278
Was that before or after
you went to jail?

57:29.345 --> 57:31.438
Before.

57:31.514 --> 57:36.975
And Pepper, he knows
how those alarm systems work.

57:40.790 --> 57:42.018
Wait, Charlie,
what did you tell him?

57:42.125 --> 57:43.114
What did he tell you?

58:27.504 --> 58:29.165
Charlie?

58:31.741 --> 58:33.208
Charlie!

58:37.547 --> 58:40.107
Is this what I think it is?

58:40.216 --> 58:42.616
Charlie, what did you do?
What is going on?

58:44.354 --> 58:46.254
Uh, I got behind
in the third mortgage.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.017
- I didn't even know there was a second.
- Well, sure.

58:48.091 --> 58:49.080
There's a third
to pay the second,

58:49.192 --> 58:50.557
a second to pay
the first, and so on.

58:50.627 --> 58:53.858
- How'd you get this?
- "And so on"?

58:53.930 --> 58:55.557
They're taking everything.

58:58.067 --> 59:02.197
Miranda, did you go
to that orgy?

59:02.272 --> 59:05.241
I... It was a barbecue.

59:08.745 --> 59:10.770
Are you sure nothing happened?

59:12.448 --> 59:14.575
Something happened, didn't it?

59:14.651 --> 59:17.984
The swingers, they
got to you, didn't they?

59:18.087 --> 59:19.645
Goddamnit!
What've I done?

59:19.756 --> 59:21.246
I'm supposed to be
your father, you know.

59:21.324 --> 59:23.383
And here I am, throwing you
right into the lion's den.

59:23.459 --> 59:25.324
You didn't.
It was my idea.

59:25.428 --> 59:27.419
Just tell me.

59:27.497 --> 59:28.896
When you went
to the bank,

59:28.965 --> 59:30.227
what was the reason
you gave them

59:30.300 --> 59:31.824
for why we needed
the money?

59:31.935 --> 59:33.903
Home improvement.

59:33.970 --> 59:35.562
Okay.

59:35.638 --> 59:36.969
What about the second time?

59:38.474 --> 59:40.339
Swimming pool.

59:40.443 --> 59:41.432
Ah.

59:41.511 --> 59:44.002
You know,
but the timing's perfect.

59:44.113 --> 59:46.081
When is the timing ever good

59:46.149 --> 59:47.810
for getting kicked out
of your house?

59:49.252 --> 59:51.777
Think about it.

59:51.854 --> 59:53.913
Yeah.

59:53.990 --> 59:57.255
It's the Chinese thing.

59:57.327 --> 01:00:03.095
Catastrophe
equals opportunity.

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:04.155
Excuse me.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.825
It's time for you to go.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.701
"From the journal of Father Torres,

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:14.038
"November 30, 1624.

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:16.202
"When the savages
were silent,

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:19.713
"that was when the company
was most affrighted.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.147
"Evidently,
they were gathered

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.548
"around the entrance
to the cavern,

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:24.210
"awaiting such time
as our hunger

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.345
"might overwhelm good sense

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.481
"and force us
out into the open.

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:35.722
"Ofttimes perforce,
the officers were compelled

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.390
"to use their muskets,

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.900
firing over
the natives' heads."

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:45.003
I'm getting
really good vibes here.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.342
I can't believe we're doing this.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.810
- Where are you going?
- Running away. What does it look like?

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.219
We gotta stick
with the plan.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.883
- Come on!
- We gotta get out of here...

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.756
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:07.489
It's over here!

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.836
Up here!

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.121
Where's my glasses?

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:42.595
On your head!

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:51.967
It's done.

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.905
Where's the propane?

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:56.205
Over here!

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.611
Right here!

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:25.907
That ought to do it.

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:26.964
Where are you going?

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:29.909
Outside, remember?

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.144
I...

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.121
What are you doing?

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:52.099
You really sure
this is going to work?

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.762
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No... No problems.

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:58.500
Pepper, he fixed
the alarm box

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.508
so it would read
like a gas leak.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.942
- And if that's the case we don't...
- Ahh!

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.055
Panel says "gas leak."

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.148
Smell anything?

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:18.386
Yeah, I found it.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.485
Propane bottles leaked.

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.966
Perfect.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.035
Shh, tat tat tat.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:40.138
I think we should
stay here for a bit.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.154
Breaking and entering
makes everything

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:56.756
taste... different.

01:03:56.866 --> 01:04:00.199
Makes it taste,
um, livelier.

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:13.375
In those days they would've
used pitch pine torches.

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:57.149
It's got to be here
somewheres.

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:04.393
Do you smell that?

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.128
What?

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:12.569
Ammonia.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:13.734
They must've cleaned
the floor.

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:14.798
They cleaned your X off.

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:19.280
That does it, then.

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:21.748
Oh, no, I-I know
where to dig.

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:26.186
No, it's...
it's right here.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.849
- Here?
- Yes.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:32.325
No, it's... it's...

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:34.785
It's here.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.195
Charlie.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:38.324
Miranda, we're going
to dig here.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:40.766
Are you sure?

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:44.537
Well, I... I guess I'd better be.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.168
You got the walkie talkie?

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:51.303
Yeah.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.371
Pepper, is it all clear?

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.175
Yeah.

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:43.656
Come in, Charlie.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:46.600
Charlie, come in.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.514
Evening, sir.

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:04.553
What seems to be
the problem?

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.019
Motorcycle's not working?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.582
We hit rebar.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:12.456
Well, I think
I might've flooded it.

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.965
There's the throttle
right there.

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.536
I know. I know.

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.045
Hey, let me try.

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.753
Hey!

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.890
Miranda.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.483
Hey.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.997
Don't step on that.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.482
Hello.

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:46.510
- Ugh!
- Hmm.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.845
What is that smell?

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:52.081
- Ugh.
- You must've hit the sewer line.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:55.715
No, the sewer's all the way
on the other side of the store,

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.019
under pet care.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.056
Current is stronger
than I thought it'd be.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.264
That looks a lot
like sewage to me.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.636
It's the underground river.

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:16.210
Just like the journal
said it would be.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.376
Where are you going?

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.111
Sir!

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.882
Come on, sir,
you're just wasting gas.

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:40.229
Pepper.

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:48.235
Come in, Pepper.

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:50.736
Charlie?

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:54.078
This store is great.
It's got everything.

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.741
What are you doing?

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.581
That should
be long enough.

01:10:57.653 --> 01:11:02.590
The journal says the passageway's
about 40 barras.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:04.523
That's Spanish for "yards".

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.754
So it should be
about 120 feet.

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:09.297
People get killed all the time
doing stuff like this.

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:11.925
I need you to hold
the other end tightly.

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.765
Stop! You're jumping
into raw sewage.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:18.534
This is not sewage, okay?
It's sulfur.

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:20.802
I noticed before
when I tested the water,

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:23.470
it's warmer than
the room temperature.

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:27.606
And this brown color indicates
an iron sulfite hot springs.

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:28.672
There's no reasoning with you.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.217
You have an answer
for everything.

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:32.184
That really bothers you.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.279
I was hoping that I wasn't
going to have to say this.

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:36.187
- What?
- Don't make me say it.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.486
All right, then.

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.027
There's no gold, okay?

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.120
There's no treasure.

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.393
You're about to jump
into a sewer.

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.833
This whole thing
is a delusion.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:02.541
Sir, put your arms
out to your sides.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:05.848
Sir... put your arms
all the way out to your sides,

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.252
like Jesus on the cross.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:09.347
Straight out.
There you go, just like that.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.660
Pepper.
Come in, Pepper.

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:25.734
I need some help in here.

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.207
- Pepper, are you there?
- Roll him over.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:31.576
Pepper, the button's
on the side.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.114
Pepper, push the button
on the side.

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:38.084
Ventura 105 to all units,
be advised.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.417
We believe we've got
a 459 there now

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.456
inside the Costco.

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:45.026
Any available unit
please respond.

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:47.117
Damn.

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:48.958
# Here are you #

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.929
# Here am I #

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.933
# No moon in view #

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.094
# No star on high #

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:59.402
# But it's a lovely
night to spoon #

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.807
# Let's pretend
that there's a moon #

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.377
Pepper, where are you?

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:06.972
# Nights like this
were made for love #

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:10.574
# Regardless of the moon above #

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:15.555
# The time and place
are opportune #

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.819
- # Let's pretend that there's a moon #
- Pepper, is that you?

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.997
Pepper, please come in.

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.335
Where are you, Pepper?

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:00.654
Uh!

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:08.231
"Journal of Father Torres,
February 9th, 1624.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.430
"Final entry.

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:12.905
"We were trapped in a cavern
whose walls were marked

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.737
"with their
childish carvings.

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:18.574
"A cavern sometimes used
for whatever variety of pagan ritual

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.513
"which these lost people
felt compelled to observe.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:23.107
Miranda.

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.845
"I miss my home

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.388
and wish to leave this land
so filled with madness."

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:30.118
I found it! I...

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.783
Miranda.

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.707
Come on, my little
sack of potatoes.

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:38.256
You smell awful.

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:45.356
I found it.

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:47.196
Didn't get all of it.

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:50.430
Still a lot more
down there.

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.700
I gotta go back.

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:54.503
Huh?

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.811
Do you believe me?

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:21.499
What are you going to do?

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.868
You're staying right there.

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:25.564
What about you?

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.310
You know, when I was
at the hospital

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:31.539
I used read a lot
of biographies

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:33.911
about these great men.

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:36.416
The thing was that their dads...
well, they weren't so great.

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.145
- They were screw-ups.
- What are you doing?

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:42.054
Then, I started to see
that all my life

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.921
I've been trying
to do something great.

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.757
But then I realized
that I was laying

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:50.593
the groundwork for you.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.829
You know, to do something...

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:59.897
great or whatever.

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:03.273
But your dad
was a screw-up, too.

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:05.676
Well, it was just a theory.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.185
What are we going to do?

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:14.846
Wait. Wait, wait.
Char...

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:18.791
This is very important.

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.192
Don't lose it.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.457
Wait, where are you going?

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.896
Just tell them that
I forced you into this.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.627
- What?
- You just tell them I'm nuts.

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:27.861
Charlie.
Charlie.

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:30.234
Charlie, come on.
Charlie.

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:33.206
I don't think...

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:38.804
that I've thanked you, ever,
for what you've done for me.

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.912
Thank you.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.649
Thank you.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:58.895
Wait. Charlie.
Charlie!

01:18:58.967 --> 01:18:59.991
Charlie!

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:04.903
And don't let them push you around.

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:07.567
Charlie, come on, please.

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:09.576
Charlie!

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:10.804
Charlie.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.004
Charlie.

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:16.175
Charlie, wait, wait!
Come back!

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:17.615
Dad!

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.342
Hey, you!

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.822
Follow me!

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:46.663
Shit!

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:30.582
They searched all night,

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:33.416
but they never did
find Charlie's body.

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.099
One of the cops asked me

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:49.762
why Charlie jumped back
into the hole.

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:53.433
I told him it was where
Charlie wanted to go.

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:56.602
It was where he wanted
to go all along.

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:58.805
The cop looked at me
like I was crazy

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:01.439
and stopped asking me questions.

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:15.262
What I didn't tell them
was that if Charlie hadn't tied me up,

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:17.594
I probably would've
followed him.

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:33.660
Want to know how
California got its name?

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:37.898
It's not named after
some explorer or king.

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:39.405
Nope.

01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:41.908
Someone made the name up.

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:43.944
A writer.

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.242
He just pulled it
out of his imagination

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:50.683
in the 16th century in Spain.

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:55.188
He made up this place where
there was unlimited gold and pearis,

01:24:55.290 --> 01:25:00.694
and beautiful, fierce women who
wore gold armor and rode wild beasts,

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:03.161
and he called it "California."

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.026
It's true.

01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:09.194
It was a bestseller back then.

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:12.000
Oh, yeah!

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:21.039
Charlie told me that.

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:24.516
He said I could look it up
if I didn't believe him.

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:28.221
But I didn't need to.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.373
Excuse me?

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:50.137
Beautiful place.
This is California, huh?

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.507
Oh.

01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:58.074
Yeah.

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:11.092
Welcome.

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:38.018
# I'd like to rest
my heavy head tonight #

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:42.290
# On a bed
of California stars #

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:46.697
# I'd like to lay
my weary bones tonight #

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:51.034
# On a bed
of California stars #

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:55.371
# I'd love to feel
your hand touching mine #

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:59.641
# And tell me why
I must keep working on #

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:04.081
# Yes, I'd give my life
to lay my head tonight #

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:09.112
# On a bed
of California stars #

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:30.235
# I'd like to dream
my troubles all away #

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:35.078
# On a bed
of California stars #

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:38.915
# Jump up from my starbed
and make another day #

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:43.287
# Underneath
my California stars #

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:47.658
# They hang like grapes
on vines that shine #

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:51.994
# And warm the lover's glass
like friendly wine #

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.297
# So, I'd give this world
just to dream #

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:56.598
# A dream with you #

01:27:56.671 --> 01:28:01.665
# On our bed
of California stars #

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:22.720
# I'd love to feel
your hand touching mine #

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:27.028
# And tell me why
I must keep working on #

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:31.367
# Yes, I'd give my life
to lay my head tonight #

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:36.535
# On a bed
of California stars #

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:07.898
# Oh... #

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:13.845
# How can I stand aside #

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:18.750
# And watch all these
colors fly #

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:24.348
# Out of this world
and into the next #

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:27.883
# My heart is on fire #

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:33.127
# And I'm getting
reckless, too #

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:39.364
# Though the dream #

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:45.037
# Is slipping
through my hands #

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:48.480
# They're not mine to hold #

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:51.484
# This flood of dreams #

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:57.115
# Is taking control #

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:03.830
# When you were mine #

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:07.059
# The sky was so high #

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:10.070
# The forests were green #

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:14.802
# And the stars were bright #

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:18.003
# Now I've got the road #

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:20.842
# Leading me off #

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:27.012
# Gravity dissolves #

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:35.256
# Oh, my home
is floating away #

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:41.131
# My dreams take to the road #

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:47.266
# As I try to stay afloat
