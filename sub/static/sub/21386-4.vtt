And...

00:48.257 --> 00:50.248
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.343 --> 00:53.426
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

00:53.512 --> 00:56.345
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.432 --> 01:00.300

Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.320 --> 01:12.357
Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:18.329 --> 01:20.365
-How about now?
-No, still too dark.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.445
I can barely see you.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.622
I know, I'm trying to
keep it mysterious.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.245
Okay, so I can
roll around in lingerie,

01:25.336 --> 01:26.667
but I don't get
to see you jerk it?

01:27.129 --> 01:28.994
-All right.
-Well, listen, ﬁrst of all, baby,

01:29.090 --> 01:31.422
you’re gonna ruin the whole
romantic thing happening now,

01:31.509 --> 01:33.045
believe me,
the last thing you wanna do

01:33.177 --> 01:34.678
is see me
in all my shame.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.218
Do not
be ashamed, okay?

01:36.305 --> 01:37.681
I am so proud of you.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.721
What you are doing
is proactive.

01:40.226 --> 01:42.308
-Okay.
-Checking to see if you can reproduce

01:42.395 --> 01:44.226
even when you have
no intention of doing so

01:44.313 --> 01:47.931
anytime in the near future,
that shows maturity.

01:48.109 --> 01:50.191
Yeah, listen, honey,
I gotta tell you,

01:50.528 --> 01:53.065
/ really appreciate the support.
It means a lot to me.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.608
Uh, but what would
also mean a lot to me is if you take

01:55.700 --> 01:58.612
your perfectly round, beautiful ass
and hike it in the air.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.156

take a screen grab?

02:08.754 --> 02:10.460
No! Why would I take
a screen grab of you?

02:10.548 --> 02:12.254
I got the real thing.
Come on.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.297
Okay. Don't get lube
all over your phone.

Jim McMahon's aboveground pool.

everything... 'Gram.

02:45.458 --> 02:46.664
You follow
Tom Brady?

02:46.751 --> 02:48.833
Just so I don't look like
a creep following his wife.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.908
Plus, he only posts pictures of him

02:50.004 --> 02:52.120
practicing and wearing
them ugly-ass Uggs.

02:52.214 --> 02:55.047

your old ass on the 'Gram, Dennis.

to break it to you,

like this anymore.

That's my girl.

-God.
-When was that?

quarterback from last time, all right?

He used to play for the Raiders.

-Amber.

Must be her apology
for yesterday's behavior.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.914
You sent these to Amber
to apologize to her.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.127
She just
sent them back.

-I did?
-Yeah, you had me do it.

Wait, you don't
remember this?

What does that even mean?

04:35.401 --> 04:36.607
Well, it's a threat, Joe.

04:36.819 --> 04:38.434
I mean, it's really
fucking subtle,

04:38.529 --> 04:39.644
but it's still
a threat.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.194
Well, they can't
do shit to us.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.273
Actually, they could
ass-fuck us multiple ways,

04:43.367 --> 04:44.823
starting with
our registration.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.738
-No, they couldn't.
-They can and they will.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.160
-Well, that would suck.
-Yep.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.033
They could also
take away that ASM box

we have at
the Dolphins' game, too.

-Yeah, so do |.

(CLICKS TONGUE) It's also a matter
of credibility.

The league can go
after that, too.

Let me tell you something,
for two guys

05:00.259 --> 05:01.419
who didn't start off with a lot of that,

05:01.510 --> 05:02.625
we don't have shit
to spare.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.631
What's their fucking
problem with you anyway?

05:04.722 --> 05:06.303
It's an old boys' club,
Joe, all right?

05:06.390 --> 05:08.051
I ain't old enough,
I ain't white enough,

05:08.142 --> 05:10.474
and I sure as fuck ain't clean enough,
and neither are you.

What about the Raiders? Are they a lock?

Nothing's a lock.

gonna back channel for us,

that words without actions,

05:17.443 --> 05:18.728

to shit.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.901

playing a trick on me

05:20.988 --> 05:23.149
or is the legendary maverick
Spencer Strasmore

05:23.240 --> 05:24.400
second-guessing himself?

pragmatism, Joe.

Yeah, you pragmatic? (LAUGHS)

called himself pragmatic.

tell you something,

05:34.668 --> 05:38.035
it's not a me thing,
it's a we thing, okay?

you go in on this,

pretty steep.

Why are you such
a masochist, man, huh?

05:44.470 --> 05:46.131
We got a great business
going here.

05:46.222 --> 05:47.803
I'll give you
two billion reasons why.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.846
No. No, no, no.
That's not you.

I would do it, sure,

just about the bucks.

Ricky and Vernon?

I like that one.

but I don't believe you.

we are always the good.

-I really believe that.
-The answer is no, Charles.

impassioned pitch,

I'm gonna coordinate that
with you, Charles.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.648
-Thank you, Larry.
-Don’t mention it.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.576
Sorry, babe, we gotta
stick a pin in brunch.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.079
Fuck me and not feed me?
Fuck you. We'll eat quick.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.035
Come on,
I want stone crabs.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.037
I don't get it.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.835
Jason just said
the same thing I did.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.246
He said it better, Charles.
Be grateful.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.123
You may not have got it
the way you wanted it,

09:11.218 --> 09:12.458
but you got it
nonetheless.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.629
Now go coordinate.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.174
I spent 250,000

09:16.265 --> 09:18.176
on American Pharoah's
supersonic splooge.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.215
You better deliver me
the next Secretariat

09:20.310 --> 09:22.892
or you'll be shoveling
the most colossal mountain Of horse shit

09:22.980 --> 09:24.470
you've ever seen,
Okay?

09:24.773 --> 09:26.479
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-Giddy up.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.269
Hey, I'm seeing you
at the stable in 30, right?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.604
Yeah, listen, Wayne, ljust have to
push that back by a few, Okay?

09:33.699 --> 09:35.564
Hey, Reggie, put Vernon
on the phone, please?

09:35.659 --> 09:37.115
-WAYNE: How few is a few?
-Just a few hours.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.942
ljust gotta put out
a very quick fire for a client.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.026
Can we talk about that
a little bit later?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.908
-This is more important.
-I thought you were gonna tell me

09:41.999 --> 09:44.456
it was something important,
like a testicular cancer scare.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.167
NO, not that important,
but still nonetheless, it's important.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.711
More important than
bringing your team to Vegas?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.172
I only stuck around
for this lunch, Spencer.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.965
I'm heading back
to LV today.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.086
Jet is washed
and the Joe's Stones are on ice.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.014
-What's up? Wish I had better news.
-Wayne, yeah, I understand.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.761
I get it,
it's only a onetime pass.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.093
-Yeah, it happened again.
-lt's not gonna happen again.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.974
Yeah, he's more than
a little upset, Vernon.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.600
-Wayne, hold on one second.
-He's cutting you.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.353
Cutting me or cut me?
What tense did he use?

10:10.736 --> 10:13.352
What the fuck does it matter
what tense he used, Vernon?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.653
-Jesus. Come on.
-You didn't listen.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.105
What the fuck
are we gonna do, Joe?

10:16.200 --> 10:17.690
Me and Spencer
are heading there now.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.321
We are gonna beg
for mercy.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.743
You are gonna
fucking divest yourself

10:21.997 --> 10:24.454
of the entire weed business
ASAP, you hear me?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.916
First off, calm the fuck down
when you talk to us, man.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.201
We ain't done nothing

10:29.296 --> 10:31.628
that wasn’t in accordance
with Colorado state law.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.000
Reggie,
please stop talking.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.582
The NFL ain't the motherfucking

10:34.676 --> 10:36.541
Constitution of
the United States Of America, Joe.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.754
No, it's more fucking important,
Reggie, you fucking moron!

10:39.848 --> 10:42.464
Jesus. Calm down.
Reggie, listen, it's Spencer.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.016
Vernon is getting out
of the fucking weed business,

10:45.103 --> 10:46.604
-you hear me?
-No, fuck you.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.224
Shut the fuck up!
You hear me, Reggie,

10:48.315 --> 10:49.304
you motherfucker?

10:49.399 --> 10:51.014
You're out Of the fucking
weed business.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.940
-Fuck him!
-Whoa! What the fuck?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.142
What?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.362
God damn it.
Listen, I'm sorry.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.064
-I thought it was my phone, okay?
-It wasn't.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.115
-Okay, calm yourself. This is Wayne.
-Oh.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.485
Hey, buddy,
still there?

11:02.746 --> 11:05.362
Bomb fuse has been lit,
Spencer, and the timer started.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.034
You got two hours.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.783
-Fuck me!
-Yeah, fuck you!

11:10.128 --> 11:11.334
You owe me
a new fucking phone.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.922
I got your phone.
I'll buy you a phone.

11:13.006 --> 11:13.995

11:27.896 --> 11:29.887

11:29.982 --> 11:31.347
-Dallas does it right.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.019
-Spencer.
-Hey, Tanya.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.570
You look beautiful
as always.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.695
-What are you doing here?
-Well, I heard a couple Of my friends

11:38.782 --> 11:40.397
were vacationing
in my neck Of the woods,

11:40.492 --> 11:41.527
so I thought I'd come by.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.784
Yeah, and I grew up nearby.
Might pop into my mom.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.115
SPENCER: Tanya, my business
partner, Joe Krutel.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.241
-Hi, Joe.
-Hi.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.160
Boys are getting big.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.240
TANYA: Oh, yeah.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.826
Henry is already 6'1 "
and he's only in middle school.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.377
They grow 'em big
like that in Texas.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.624
When are you
gonna make some?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.331
Be such a shame
to waste those genetics.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.666
Yeah,
I am working on it.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.375
Tanya, where is your husband?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.632
-You just missed him.
-Where'd he go?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.762
Over there, massage.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.216
Something really got
under his skin this morning.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.801
Said he needed
extra pressure.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.477
Ah. Wonder what that could be.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.476
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
what could possibly make you upset

12:13.567 --> 12:15.057
in a paradise
like this, right?

12:15.152 --> 12:16.688
He could find a way,
trust me.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.860
But stick around.
He shouldn't be that long.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.812
Besides, seeing you
will make him feel better.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.614
Ah, well, I doubt that.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.614
-You got that whole lease thing.
-Right, right, right.

It don't matter
where I'm going.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.669
What's important is
that you won't be there.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.250
What, you think I'm gonna
just let you leave with my baby?

13:23.345 --> 13:25.757
It ain't your choice.
I don't need your permission.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.553
-Shit.
-I especially don't need your money.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.597
Can you move?
And you know what?

13:29.685 --> 13:31.596
I damn sure don't need
them damn flowers,

13:31.687 --> 13:33.803
so you can send those back
to one Of your other randoms.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.398
You can't do this.
I got rights.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.347
-I could do something about this.
-Boy, please.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.023
The only rights
that are important

13:39.111 --> 13:40.317
are a woman's right
to choose,

13:40.404 --> 13:41.940
and I choose
a life without you.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.190

-Well, what's the truth?

13:48.704 --> 13:51.161
Truth is you Old as dirt
for a wide receiver.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.572
Maybe you have
a couple Of seasons left at best,

13:53.667 --> 13:55.953
but after that,
who are you? Hmm?

13:56.253 --> 13:57.459
Just some lonely-ass,

13:57.713 --> 13:59.999

with a couple Of bucks.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.924
-You wanna know the truth I see?
-Yeah.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.718
Yeah, what truth you see?

14:06.805 --> 14:08.545
Tell me. Hmm?

14:09.891 --> 14:12.382
-I ain't even gonna say it.
-Yeah, 'cause you're chicken shit.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.728
'Cause I'm a gentleman,
that's why.

14:13.812 --> 14:14.801
'Cause you have
nothing on me

14:14.896 --> 14:17.603
other than I was stupid enough
to sleep with your sorry ass.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.602
You really going for it today, huh?
Well done.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.059

just like you taught me.

SO, if you don't mind,
I have some packing to do.

14:24.781 --> 14:25.861
Oh, you know what?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.357
Can you put this on the truck
for me on your way out?

14:29.786 --> 14:30.821
Thank you.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.874

14:38.962 --> 14:40.998
Hey, I'm gonna have
the tuna tartare,

14:41.173 --> 14:42.879
and can you have 'em
throw a fried egg on it?

14:42.966 --> 14:44.081
Okay, fuck me, huh?

14:44.676 --> 14:47.133
Two hours late for the biggest
meeting of our lives.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.677
We got Bossman in the cabana
getting his balls rubbed,

14:49.765 --> 14:51.847
and you're out here asking
for the fucking tartare?

14:51.933 --> 14:53.889
You know the surgeon general
just said that stress

14:53.977 --> 14:55.433
is more dangerous
than smoking?

14:55.520 --> 14:56.930
Maybe you should
think about that.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.307
We miss Wayne,
we're fucked.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.722
Ah, there he is.
It's about fucking time.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.103
Look at him saunter.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.980
God, that must have been
some release, huh?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.403
Oh. All right
here we go.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.487
(LAUGHS)

15:11.578 --> 15:13.034
Long way from home,
Dorothys.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.362
I'm gonna need you to
reconsider cutting Vernon.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.286
I've been spending
far too much time

15:18.376 --> 15:20.332
and getting far too little
in return, Spencer.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.628
I know I said this before,
but this time, it's guaranteed.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.797
Vernon's out
Of the weed business.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.421
Nothing like getting a guarantee
for the second time.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.252
Ah. No, that first time
was a promise.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.463
This is a guarantee.
Totally different thing.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.427
Bossman, come on,
he's a good kid.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.096
Hell, I know he is.
I'm actually quite fond of him.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.520
DO you gentlemen have any idea
how difficult it is

15:40.732 --> 15:42.597
to Operate the greatest brand
in sports?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.562
You own the New England
Patriots, too?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.359
I'm totally kidding.
NO, we don't.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.279
People are always looking
for new ways to knock us down.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.902
(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
I can relate to that one.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.110
Hmm. Some would say
you have it coming, though.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.911
Word is you've been
sniffing in the tall weeds

15:56.998 --> 15:58.033
with a short snout.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.740
I'm not quite too sure
what that even means.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.451
Me either.
I've never heard that one, no.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.332
Spencer, if you don't wanna
admit what you're doing,

16:04.422 --> 16:06.413
maybe you shouldn't be doing it
in the first place.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.499
Bossman, I'm not afraid
to talk about anything.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.670
I just thought that

16:09.761 --> 16:11.501
that kind Of transparency
between you and I

16:11.596 --> 16:13.712
would put you in an awkward
position with the league.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.343
Let me worry about
what position I'm in.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.341
Fine, it's true.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.851
I'm guilty of sniffing
in the tall weeds.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.054
With a short snout.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.936
I wanna bring
a team to Vegas.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.564
Reaching for
the brass ring, huh?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.939
Admittedly, it's a little outside
of my expertise, but, yes.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.951
I always knew you had
big balls, Spencer,

16:34.035 --> 16:36.617
but I didn't know yourjudgment
was this questionable.

16:36.705 --> 16:37.694
How do you figure?

16:37.789 --> 16:39.029
The league's
just approved you

16:39.124 --> 16:40.489
and you're already
biting its hand?

16:40.584 --> 16:41.824
Didn't even call
for approval?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.078
That's just plain wrong.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.206
The upside's
worth it.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.041
Isuppose
we'll see.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.121
The way I see it,

16:49.050 --> 16:51.302
there's only one way
to take a team to Vegas,

16:51.386 --> 16:53.251
and that's big,
even by Texas standards.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.677
That's the only way
we do it.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.219
Big takes vision, Spencer.
DO you have a vision?

16:59.895 --> 17:00.884
I do.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.140
But even if I didn't,
Wayne Hastings does.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.352
-Wayne Hastings, huh?
-Yeah.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.399
Well, that boy there's
a proven visionary.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.321
He's like
the me Of Vegas.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.774
-Oh, you're more handsome.
-I could use your support

17:12.866 --> 17:15.152
and definitely your wisdom
to get this whole thing done.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.988
Yeah, approval
comes through Texas.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.067
Everybody knows that.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.698
And how far in
is Wayne?

17:19.789 --> 17:22.201
Balls deep,
spearheading the whole thing.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.245
-I like that.
-JOE: Yeah, we do, too.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.953
Now, uh, can we please
get back to this Vernon situation?

17:28.215 --> 17:29.250
Hmm.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.047
Let me go
put some clothes on first.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.296
-He wants to put clothes on.
-A robe counts as clothes.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.969
TTD: Here we go, Rick.
You got him.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.095
-GO!
-You got him.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.723
Come on, he gained too much space.
Look at that route.

17:44.314 --> 17:47.147
-What the hell was that?
-One, two, three, throw.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.350
He got it. He's nervous.
You're Ricky Jerret.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.809
Off the line, got him.
Do it!

17:52.530 --> 17:54.145
Oh, my God.
Damn!

17:54.241 --> 17:55.606

He done, he done.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.860
There it is.
There it is.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.200
-What the fuck?
-Come on!

17:59.704 --> 18:02.696

18:04.542 --> 18:05.827

18:06.127 --> 18:07.412

18:08.088 --> 18:09.919
Man, chase his ass.
Chase him.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.258
-Get him! What are you smiling for?
-Dude, run!

18:12.342 --> 18:14.128
Y'all take five.
Good play. Take five.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.335
-Come here.
-Where the hell are you throwing?

18:16.513 --> 18:17.502
Sorry, Rick.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.762
You know what
a skinny post is?

18:20.058 --> 18:22.174
Why the fuck are you throwing it
so high and behind me?

18:22.852 --> 18:24.638
We don't even
call plays at my school.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.354
School? What you in...
What school you go to?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.393
-Miami-Dade High.
-You in high school?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.183
-Get the fuck out Of here.
-Really?

ashamed Of yourself.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.281
We got Amendola, Gronk,
and Edelman working with Brady.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.953
You got me out here
with Matthew Stafford's little brother.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.746
That's all I can get
on such short notice.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.293
-What do you want me to do?
-Collect them cones

18:47.419 --> 18:49.000
and pay little Stafford
his beer money.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.869

a motherfucking Uber home.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.124
I hate you
right now.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.501
You embarrassed me
out there.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.636

it's causing both Of us.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.061
I can feel it closing in
on my nuts right now.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.981
And after that conversation
with the Bossman?

20:39.531 --> 20:41.817
I don't know, I'm starting
to think maybe we are

20:41.908 --> 20:43.409
on the evil side
of things here.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.907
Maybe you're just not emotionally
cut out for this, Joe.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.579
Yeah, maybe.
And clearly, you're not either.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.580
I ever tell you
the story about my dad?

20:56.047 --> 20:58.129
What, your real dad
or your adoptive dad?

20:58.216 --> 21:00.172
Asshole, my adoptive dad
is my real dad.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.632
Okay, Okay, good.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.050
I didn't wanna hear a story

21:03.138 --> 21:04.878
about you searching for
your biological father.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.759
-Shut the fuck up, Joe.
-Done.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.051
Please continue.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.555
My dad Carl was
a loving man, tough man.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.763
-Like you.
-Much more loving, much tougher.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.942
He worked in
the mills in Bethlehem, all right?

21:19.237 --> 21:21.569
Provided a decent living.
He took care Of us.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.863
Supported us.
Nothing lavish.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.315
-Right.
-SO, one day,

21:25.410 --> 21:27.401
he gets a call
into the big boss's Office.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.741
First time he's met him
in 30 years.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.534
SO, what did
the boss say?

21:32.625 --> 21:33.660
Nothing.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.245
Nothing?

21:36.171 --> 21:37.877
What the fuck
kind of story is this?

21:38.506 --> 21:40.542
You see, it's not about
what the boss said,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.043
it's what
he didn't say, Joe.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.294
He didn't say anything
interesting at all.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.837
-Ah.
-SO, after 30 years,

21:47.932 --> 21:49.012
my dad finally had a chance

21:49.100 --> 21:50.840
to sit across from the man
who was running everything.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.638
And you know
what he saw?

21:53.104 --> 21:54.093
What?

21:56.024 --> 21:57.013
Nothing.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.314
Nothing special.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.318
My dad realized
in that moment

22:03.072 --> 22:05.563
he could have been that guy
sitting behind that desk.

22:08.578 --> 22:09.909
But he realized it
too late.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.158
We're all just
a bunch Of guys, Joe.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.790
Some Of us believe
that we could do anything.

22:19.297 --> 22:20.878
And some Of us
believe we can't.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.920
SO, when you ask me
why I wanna do this,

22:25.011 --> 22:28.253
my answer is because
I know what guy I wanna be.

22:30.808 --> 22:31.797
What about you?

22:34.312 --> 22:36.644
I definitely don't
wanna be the guy

22:36.731 --> 22:38.767
thatjust lets the clock
run out, you know.

22:39.943 --> 22:43.606
I definitely do not wanna be
the guy who just sits there

22:43.696 --> 22:46.187
while time
fucking stands still.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.362
I wanna be the guy.

22:47.867 --> 22:48.982
-The fucking guy?
-Yeah!

26:19.120 --> 26:20.656
I'm gonna wanna hear,
Spenceh

26:21.289 --> 26:22.745
I just met
with the Cowboys.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.534
-Underlings?
-Bossman.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.038
I was with him all day.
That's why I couldn't make the lunch.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.118
And?

26:29.255 --> 26:31.086
And are you available
to meet with him?

26:33.676 --> 26:35.337
He's ready to support
our efforts.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.721
Wayne, this is a meeting
you are really going to enjoy.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.891
The only one on this Earth
who he admires

26:43.978 --> 26:48.563
just as much as himself
is Wayne Hastings, Jr.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.140
Junior.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.151
(CHUCKLES) Ah.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.779
Get the bags
out Of the car.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.403
-Yeah.
-What?

27:00.995 --> 27:02.576
Well, I'll just go tell the hotel

27:02.663 --> 27:05.075
to get whatever douchebag
they put in your suite...

27:05.166 --> 27:06.656
Okay, you can
go do it, then.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.366
Always use another
night in Miami.

27:08.628 --> 27:09.663
Yes, we could.

27:14.342 --> 27:16.128
-(EXHALES DEEPLY)
-Fuck.

27:17.637 --> 27:18.672
