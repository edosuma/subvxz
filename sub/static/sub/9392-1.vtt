08:27.307 --> 08:29.741
and there is a giant poo
on your desk.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.779
Hey, Horace,
another round for everybody.

08:34.781 --> 08:37.282
(patrons cheering)

08:37.284 --> 08:38.517
Gosh, Peter,
you're really

08:38.519 --> 08:39.784
being generous
with your money.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.186
Hey, what's the point
of being rich

08:41.188 --> 08:43.088
if you can't share it
with your pals, huh?

08:43.090 --> 08:44.456
Okay, wait,
I-I got one.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.957
Who would you
rather do?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.759
Susan Boyle
or a sex doll

08:47.761 --> 08:49.661
that's been passed
around a fraternity?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.096
Well, have they been
cleaning the doll?

08:51.098 --> 08:53.331
Please, these guys are Betas--
they're total animals.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.499
Hey, I got
one, Peter.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.667
What would you
rather do?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.302
Tread water where
you are right now

08:57.304 --> 08:59.137
or increase your
net worth fivefold

08:59.139 --> 09:00.672
within the next
18 months?

09:00.674 --> 09:01.840
Huh?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.275
What? I... what are you
talking about?

09:03.277 --> 09:05.477
Well, my friend Marty
is a whiz with chemistry,

09:05.479 --> 09:07.012
and he says
he's come up

09:07.014 --> 09:08.480
with a new penis
enlargement pill,

09:08.482 --> 09:11.616
and if we can bankroll him
$100,000 in startup money,

09:11.618 --> 09:13.485
he'll triple our
investment in a year.

09:13.487 --> 09:16.087
Well, uh...
gee, I-I'm... I don't, uh...

09:16.089 --> 09:17.522
Peter, I've taken
the liberty

09:17.524 --> 09:19.591
of mocking up some
sales projections.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.092
Wow, that's pretty good.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.994
And this would be
our net profits.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.195
Yikes.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.797
You know, Peter, uh,

09:25.799 --> 09:29.134
Bonnie's birthday is coming up,
and I'll be gol-darned

09:29.136 --> 09:31.937
if I didn't go ahead and
promise her that Stevie Nicks

09:31.939 --> 09:34.940
would come to our house
and sing three songs to her.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.043
(chuckling):
Boy, do I got a big mouth, huh?

09:38.045 --> 09:40.378
Yeah, if you're going to open
your mouth with the missus,

09:40.380 --> 09:41.880
stick to kisses, huh?
(laughs)

09:41.882 --> 09:44.816
(both laughing)

09:44.818 --> 09:47.085
What neat humor.
What neat humor.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.354
So what do say, Peter?
Can you help us out?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.956
Of course I can, you dope.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.757
We're pals, right?

09:55.094 --> 09:56.261
There you go.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.295
Hey, Horace,
give us

09:57.297 --> 09:58.663
three shots
of your best bourbon.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.966
And have that Russian waiter
I like bring it over.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.677
All right, well,
thanks again, Peter.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.145
I got to head out.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.980
I told my mother I'd visit
her in the hospital.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.415
Yeah, and I got to work.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.117
I'm flying a leg
to Minneapolis tonight.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.284
Oh.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.486
Yeah, I-I-I understand.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.820
You... you've got
other things to do.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.355
I-I just wrote you guys
a couple of checks,

10:57.357 --> 10:58.957
but no, you... you-you-you
do your things.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.992
What?
No, I mean, I-I'm just saying,

11:00.994 --> 11:03.328
I-I thought friends hang out,
do things with each other.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.929
You know,
especially when one friend

11:04.931 --> 11:07.465
gives the other friends
a whole bunch of money.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.935
Oh. Well, I guess I
could stick around.

11:10.937 --> 11:14.039
Yeah, and I-I guess
the co-pilot can fly the plane.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.108
She's a woman and passengers
are usually okay with that.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.309
I once saw a
deodorant commercial

11:18.311 --> 11:19.878
that had a
woman pilot.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.346
That's more like it.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.948
From now on, we're all gonna do
whatever I want to do.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.250
'Cause I'm the one
with the dough.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.951
Okay, I guess that's fair.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.620
Good.
'Cause what I want to do is

11:28.622 --> 11:30.522
stay here, get drunk
and watch TV.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.958
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>Michael</i>
<i>McDonald During Allergy Season.</i>

11:33.960 --> 11:35.960
(gasping):
Haa...

11:35.962 --> 11:38.129
Haa-haa...

11:38.131 --> 11:40.265
Haa-haa-haa-haa-haa...

11:40.267 --> 11:41.599
Haa...

11:41.601 --> 11:43.334
(sneezes):
♪ Haa-chu!

11:45.171 --> 11:48.139
Hey, Peter, you wanted me
to watch the entire first season

11:48.141 --> 11:50.675
of   <i>True Bloo</i>and come show you
where there was boob?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.143
That's right, I
don't want to see

11:52.145 --> 11:53.545
any actual <i>True</i>
<i>Blood,</i> just boob.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.046
Yeah, well, I found some.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.850
No!

11:58.852 --> 12:01.286
Anna Paquin boob does
not count as real boob!

12:01.288 --> 12:03.588
That's like looking
at a 12-year-old boy.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.657
Geez. Y-You should
know that, Joe!

12:05.659 --> 12:06.925
You should
definitely know that!

12:06.927 --> 12:07.992
Sorry, Peter.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.028
Sorry doesn't show me
nipples worth seeing!

12:10.030 --> 12:12.931
And as for you, Anna, you're
dreadful and so is the program.

12:12.933 --> 12:13.998
I didn't write it.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.934
Yeah, but you know
the people who do.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.535
That Alan Ball--
you know him, right?

12:17.537 --> 12:18.503
Yeah.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.604
How come everything
he writes

12:19.606 --> 12:21.473
is so dreary?
I don't know.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.274
Tell him to cheer up!
Things ain't so bad!

12:23.276 --> 12:26.044
This is a weird episode.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.914
Okay, Quagmire, I want you
to take the first bite

12:29.916 --> 12:33.651
because that first bite
is the one that really hurts.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.920
Well, okay.

12:35.922 --> 12:39.624
(grunting)

12:39.626 --> 12:41.926
Ah! Ow!

12:41.928 --> 12:42.927
Ow!

12:42.929 --> 12:43.995
Yeah, that's right "Ow."

12:43.997 --> 12:45.130
Now, you swallow that.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.097
Don't you dare spit that out.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.098
What's the
difference?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.099
You got what
you wanted.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.100
I said swallow it!

12:49.102 --> 12:50.201
(gulps)

12:50.203 --> 12:51.936
Now, smear what's
left of it on your face

12:51.938 --> 12:55.840
and look at me
with your mouth open.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.076
Look at yourself,
you filthy whore.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.547
I don't even
want this now.

13:06.819 --> 13:09.420
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do
a synchronized duet

13:09.422 --> 13:11.923
of "Makin' Whoopee" while
I shoot you with this BB gun.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.091
That doesn't
sound safe.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.125

Relax, Joe.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.823
I'm nowhere near your eye.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.090
Hey, Joe, open your eye.

13:46.092 --> 13:49.093
(screaming)
Gotcha.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.095
What the hell, Peter?!
You shot him in the eye!

Keep singing, you.
And keep your chin up,

13:52.499 --> 13:53.665

13:53.667 --> 13:55.533
No, no screw this!
You're a jerk!

13:55.535 --> 13:57.168
Jerk? What kind of a way is that

13:57.170 --> 13:59.037
to talk to your friend
who gives you money?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.104
Go to hell, Peter!

14:00.106 --> 14:01.339
We don't need
your money!

14:01.341 --> 14:02.941
And we don't need
friends like you!

14:02.943 --> 14:04.342
Yeah! We're out of here!

14:04.344 --> 14:05.710
Fine, go on. I don't care.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.345
I don't need you, I got money!

14:07.347 --> 14:09.814
You know, Peter,
you used to be a great guy.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.349
But ever since
you won that lottery...

14:11.351 --> 14:12.951
(screaming)

14:12.953 --> 14:14.586
Come on, Joe!

14:14.588 --> 14:16.654
(bleep) this guy!
Aah!

14:19.592 --> 14:21.960
I'm here to audition
for    <i>Fiddler on the R.</i>

14:21.962 --> 14:23.361
Come right in.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.005
Peter, my God, what the
hell are you wearing?

14:34.007 --> 14:36.274
It's a solid gold
tuxedo, Lois.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.775
I had to fight three rappers

14:37.777 --> 14:39.544
down at the Nonsense Store
for this.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.312
Look, Peter, this
is not who we are.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.448
I'm worried the money
is changing this family,

14:43.450 --> 14:44.983
and not the
way you hoped.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.185
Well, I was hoping it would make
you shut up, so you're right.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.020
You know, I spoke to
Bonnie this morning,

14:49.022 --> 14:51.956
and she said you haven't talked
to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.758
Who cares?
I don't need Quagmire.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.326
And I certainly don't need Joe.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.694
I got Money Joe.

14:56.696 --> 14:57.695
(laughs)

14:57.697 --> 14:59.130
That's a good one, Money Joe!

14:59.132 --> 15:01.132
I don't like what this money
is doing to us.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.368
It's even affecting
Brian and Stewie.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.435
(yawns)

15:04.437 --> 15:05.637
I think I'm gonna
take a nap.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.872
What, here?
Yeah, I had a giant mobile

15:07.874 --> 15:10.275
put in the sky so I can
sleep wherever I want.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.844
(mobile playing soft music)

15:12.846 --> 15:14.979
(sighs)
This is nice.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.348
I hope that bear
comes around soon.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.984
That's sort of my fave--
Oh, look, the bear!

15:19.986 --> 15:21.519
And it's not just them.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.622
Chris has also been developing
some very expensive tastes.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.858
Model glue, sir?

15:26.860 --> 15:28.660
Well, what do
we have today?

15:28.662 --> 15:31.930
Today we have a recent vintage
procured just this morning

15:31.932 --> 15:33.431
from Michael's Hobby Shop.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.600
Yes, that's
very nice.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.635
Bring me my
finest rag.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.270
Your fancy rag, sir.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.339
You are relieved
for the evening.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.311
(inhales deeply)

15:46.313 --> 15:49.480
You don't see
poor people doing this!

15:49.482 --> 15:50.682
Lois, don't you understand?

15:50.684 --> 15:53.017
We don't got any of
our old problems anymore.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.953
We don't have to worry
about paying bills,

15:54.955 --> 15:56.788
we don't have to worry
about saving dough.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.157
All we got to do
is enjoy ourselves.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.491
Interested?

16:01.460 --> 16:03.027
(gasps)

16:03.029 --> 16:05.463
Oh, my God.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.866
Peter, it's
beautiful!

16:08.868 --> 16:10.168
Is it a blood
diamond?

16:10.170 --> 16:11.536
Ah, the bloodiest.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.138
The two kids who found it were
forced to murder each other.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.007
Oh, Peter,
I love it.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.943
Hey, you want to watch a DVD
of the murder while we do it?

16:18.945 --> 16:20.278
I already watched it
eight times,

16:20.280 --> 16:22.747
so I know exactly
which part I want to blam at.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.952
Chris, Meg, now that
I'm a rich father,

16:27.954 --> 16:30.688
you will try to impress me,
and I will remain distant.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.789
Go.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.925
Um, say, Dad,
did I tell you

16:33.927 --> 16:36.027
I got second place
in the yacht race?

16:36.029 --> 16:38.162
Hmm. Sounds like
somebody's dad

16:38.164 --> 16:40.131
is happier than
me right now.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.632
Well, um, how about this, Dad?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.768
The school paper is
doing a story about me.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.603
That's because I
had it arranged.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.439
Uh, I was thinking about
joining the Army?

16:48.441 --> 16:49.540
No.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.642
Meg, as a girl, your
life holds no merit.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.945
And, Chris, try as you
may, you will never be

16:53.947 --> 16:55.813
as good as your older
brother who died.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.415
He was good at
sports and talking.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.417
Now, pardon me
while I look at scrimshaw

16:59.419 --> 17:01.185
through a magnifying glass.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.821
Ah, brave men all.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.823
Lost sons of New Bedford.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.558
That's good scrimshaw.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.131
Ah, I never thought
I'd be having high tea

17:13.133 --> 17:15.199
at the Park Barrington
every single day.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.935
Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea
of white faces, isn't it?

17:17.937 --> 17:21.339
Waiter, have the chef prepare
a bucket of your finest caviar,

17:21.341 --> 17:23.508
and then give it
a helicopter tour of the city.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.509
Very good, sir.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.110
Very good indeed.

17:26.112 --> 17:29.013
I hope it enjoys it as much as
that Maine lobster I ordered.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.349
And over there is the
Rhode Island State House,

17:31.351 --> 17:33.785
the second largest
self-supporting marble dome

17:33.787 --> 17:34.986
in North America.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.654
Why the (bleep)
am I doing this?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.156
I could've just
said I did it.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.991
Sir, about
your bill...

17:39.993 --> 17:41.659
Oh, don't worry, Carstairs,

17:41.661 --> 17:43.795
there's ample gratuity
on there for you.

17:43.797 --> 17:44.929
(chuckles):
Nyah.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.999
Well, actually, sir, your
card has been declined.

17:48.001 --> 17:49.333
(laughs):
Oh, really?

17:49.335 --> 17:51.869
Well, I'm sure a brief call
to my accountant

17:51.871 --> 17:54.105
will resolve this
to our mutual satisfaction.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.275
Hello, Schnozzenstein?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.676
This is Peter Griffin.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.678
There seems to be
some issue with our credit.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.648
I told Carstairs
you'd set everything straight.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.949
What do you mean I'm broke?!

18:04.951 --> 18:07.452
What about all that money
I sent to the Gayman Islands?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.187
They did what with it?!

18:09.189 --> 18:11.255
No, I don't want it back!

18:11.257 --> 18:13.091
I'm gonna miss you,
Carstairs.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.660
I shall miss
you, too, sir.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.161
With no one to look after,

18:17.163 --> 18:19.030
Carstairs fell into
a deep depression

18:19.032 --> 18:20.998
from which he never emerged.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.800
He died two weeks later.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.302
Some say of a broken heart.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.336
What, sir?

18:25.338 --> 18:26.871
But that was Carstairs.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.809
I can't believe it.

18:31.811 --> 18:32.977
We lost everything.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.612
What do we do now?

18:34.614 --> 18:36.914
Well, seems like our
only hope is the lottery.

18:36.916 --> 18:40.118
Holy (bleep), we won twice and
we're right back here again.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.354
We had $150 million, and
we blew through it in a month.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.656
Yeah, but on the bright side,
if this hadn't happened,

18:45.658 --> 18:46.858
we never would've met Kyle.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.025
Hey.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.460
Hello.
Hey there.
Hi.
What's up?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.129
And that's not even Kyle.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.463
Peter, we can't
live like this.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.132
Well, what are we
supposed to do, Lois?

18:54.134 --> 18:55.533
Everything we
had is gone!

18:55.535 --> 18:57.001
We have friends, Peter.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.436
Not anymore, we don't.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.704
They're good people.

18:59.706 --> 19:00.771
They'll listen.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.473
And they'll care
what happens to us,

19:02.475 --> 19:05.143
even after everything
that's happened.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.478
You know, I'm still young
enough you can drop me

19:07.480 --> 19:09.580
at the fire station,
no questions asked.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.824
Well, well.
Look who it is.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.825
Who is it?

19:20.827 --> 19:21.826
It's me, Peter.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.827
I'm standing
right here.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.095
This is a glass eye, Peter.

19:24.097 --> 19:26.097
They had to remove
the one you shot.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.366
Oh, boy, that whole
day was a mess, huh?

19:28.368 --> 19:30.134
What happened to you, anyway?
You look terrible.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.703
Look, you guys,
I messed up bad.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.639
Winning the lottery
was the worst thing

19:34.641 --> 19:36.507
that ever happened
to me and my family.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.943
I thought being rich
would solve all my problems,

19:38.945 --> 19:42.180
but all it did was make me
forget what was important.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.248
Like who my real friends are.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.983
I don't expect
you to forgive me,

19:45.985 --> 19:49.687
but if, for some reason, you do,
you can find me

19:49.689 --> 19:52.557
in a cardboard box on the corner
of Meeting and Thayer.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.660
Peter, wait.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.030
That corner's
a bit of a hike for me.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.831
I'd rather just
come see you at home.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.369
What-- where'd you get
this kind of money?

20:05.371 --> 20:07.939
The penis enlargement pill you
gave me the startup money for.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.473
It turned a pretty nice profit.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.143
I guess it's only fair
that I give you my percentage

20:12.145 --> 20:13.644
so you can get your house back.

20:13.646 --> 20:17.415
Quagmire, I don't know
what to say.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.616
Thank you.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.951
You're welcome.

20:19.953 --> 20:22.019
And if it makes you feel better,
it was money well spent.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.487
Just ask Sandra
the waitress over there.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.989
We had a great time
last night.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.857
PETER:
Tough girl.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.226
Made it into work.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.964
Boy, I got to say,
it's good to be home.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.932
Yeah. Despite all
the ups and downs,

20:34.934 --> 20:36.601
things turned out for the best.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.270
I mean, really, we're no worse
off than we were before.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.972
Plus, we learned something.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.840
And you can't
put a price on that.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.175
Look, Lois, we all know
what happened.

20:44.177 --> 20:45.343
We're all depressed.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.011
All right, let's just
go to different rooms

20:47.013 --> 20:48.980
and stare blankly
out the window, saying nothing.
