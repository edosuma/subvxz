12:44.894 --> 12:47.157
Chump change. Aren't
you guys getting tired

12:47.201 --> 12:48.332
of the minor leagues?

12:48.376 --> 12:50.508
We've been putting Nemesis
to good use.

12:50.552 --> 12:51.727
KAI:
And it's boring.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.600
Is this a red pill,
blue pill situation?

12:55.644 --> 12:57.037
'Cause I like them both.

13:01.998 --> 13:06.350
It's a job. You guys,
Nemesis is famous.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.440
People are
paying attention.Who for?

13:09.484 --> 13:11.747
The Collective.
KAI:
What?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.140
No way.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.055
Way.PEYTON:
Guys, we made this program

13:15.098 --> 13:16.839
to expose vulnerabilities.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.710
To make the world
a safer place.

13:18.754 --> 13:19.668
Not for profit.

13:19.711 --> 13:22.671
It's not
about the money.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.542
Okay, yeah.
The money's amazing,

13:24.586 --> 13:26.849
but this is
The Collective!

13:26.893 --> 13:28.068
This is bigger
than Anonymous.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.679
You guys, this is
the big leagues.

13:30.722 --> 13:31.723
It's our time
to step up.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.943
When do we start?

13:33.987 --> 13:37.599
I have to think about this.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.776
Look. Peyton, I-I know
you want to believe

13:40.820 --> 13:42.691
this is white hats
versus black hats,

13:42.734 --> 13:45.868
but what if I told you there's
a whole amazing, complicated

13:45.912 --> 13:50.655
world out there
that's just... gray?

13:50.699 --> 13:53.528
[sighs]

13:53.571 --> 13:56.748
Do you trust me?

13:59.751 --> 14:01.405
[elevator bell dings]

14:05.845 --> 14:09.500
Hey.Thanks for coming.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.415
This is about Kai, isn't it?

14:11.459 --> 14:12.808
Yeah, she hacked
the power grid.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.027
She's out of control.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.507
Yeah.
So...

14:16.551 --> 14:18.074
how was prison?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.818
There was a lot of
time to reflect...

14:22.862 --> 14:24.864
about how everything
went down.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.216
These people...
Phoenix, they...

14:29.259 --> 14:31.348
they took me in.

14:31.392 --> 14:34.917
Gave me a chance to use
my skills for good.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.919
The way you always
wanted me to.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.487
Well... [sniffs]
looks like you traded in

14:39.530 --> 14:40.705
one family for another.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.012
I thought you'd be
better off without me.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.015
And look at you.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.800
Look at everything
you've accomplished.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.890
For what it's worth...

14:53.109 --> 14:55.198
I'm really proud of you.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.681
Maybe when all this is over,
we can get some dumplings?

14:59.724 --> 15:01.161
Oh.[chuckles]

15:01.204 --> 15:03.554
I hate dumplings.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.123
The source code
for Nemesis.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.430
Time to get to work.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.052
Nice.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.358
Sure beats sitting
in L.A. traffic.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.751
I used the source code
to create a new master key

15:26.795 --> 15:28.405
that should unlock
the ransomware.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.581
Only downside is, it has
to be physically plugged

15:30.625 --> 15:32.409
into each power facility,
so we got to do this

15:32.453 --> 15:35.325
one at a time.Well, Hawkes told us
to start here.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.589
This will get power
to the most people the quickest.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.374
MAN:
Hi.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.984
Phil Lasky, lead S.R.O.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.812
I hear you can connect us
to the grid.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.292
TAYLOR:
Yes. From your lips

15:45.335 --> 15:48.469
to her ears.Uh, thanks.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.430
Well, you're operating in
critical hot standby mode?

15:53.474 --> 15:54.823
Oh, you know your stuff.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.260
When we got locked out
of the city's power grid,

15:57.304 --> 15:59.088
as a safety precaution,
I immediately

15:59.132 --> 16:01.917
tripped the reactor
and dropped the control rods.Control rods?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.397
You could think
of the control rods

16:03.440 --> 16:05.007
like the brakes
on a car.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.617
When they're dropped,
the engine idles.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.010
Take them out,
it's like hitting the gas.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.404
Exactly.
You a nuclear physicist?

16:10.447 --> 16:13.015
[chuckles]
No. It's just a hobby.

16:13.059 --> 16:13.973
Ah.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.626
RILEY:
Okay. We're ready.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.932
But once I execute the file

16:16.976 --> 16:18.586
to reconnect the plant
to the grid,

16:18.629 --> 16:19.848
the network will reboot.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.328
So nobody panic.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.677
Okay.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.229
It worked.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.666
Our main generator
is parallel to the grid.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.539
All right. Oliver, Peters,
withdraw control rods

16:58.582 --> 16:59.757
three steps at a time

16:59.801 --> 17:01.629
until the reaction's
critical, and then raise

17:01.672 --> 17:03.631
power to 15%.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.546
We've got a lot of toasters
to turn on, people.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.069
[indistinct chatter]

17:13.945 --> 17:15.773

17:37.839 --> 17:39.623
TAYLOR:
Excellent work, Riley.

17:39.667 --> 17:40.798
All right, let's go.
Hawkes says our next stop

17:40.842 --> 17:42.148
is the Keswick Dam.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.671
He also called me a
horse's ass for no reason.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.194
Really digging
the guy.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.370
[beeping]Peters. I said slow
with the control rods.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.198
The reaction's accelerating
way too fast.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.678
It's not us.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.158
The system
isn't responding.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.290
It's blowing past
all the reactor trips.

17:55.335 --> 17:56.597
The rods are pulling
up on their own.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.557
Looks like Reactor One's
coolant pumps are shutting down.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.037
There's no water pumping
through the core.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.125
What the hell's
going on here?

18:08.130 --> 18:11.525
Looks like your system's gone
a little bit bonkers here.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.961
Or maybe it's Kai.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.311
When the system rebooted,
the firewall went down.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.096
The plant was vulnerable, but
just for a fraction of a second.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.489
But that's all she needed
to take control.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.838
The ransomware was a setup.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.753
She knew this would
be our next stop

18:22.797 --> 18:24.233
and waited for me to
drop the firewall.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.888
But... why?

18:26.931 --> 18:29.282
[alarm blaring]

18:29.325 --> 18:32.198
LASKY:
The control rods
are fully raised.

18:32.241 --> 18:33.199
The reactor core's temperature's

18:33.242 --> 18:34.069
going
through the roof.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.027
[second alarm blaring]

18:36.071 --> 18:39.161
Did Kai just cut the brakes
and hit the gas?MacGYVER: Yes.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.380
And she's steering us
right towards

18:40.423 --> 18:41.685
a nuclear meltdown.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.471
[alarms continue]

[sirens wailing][indistinct shouting]

18:56.787 --> 18:58.789
Where are we
on an evacuation plan?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.835
The airports and train terminals
aren't back on their feet yet.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.358
As far as the roads,

19:02.402 --> 19:04.578
the blackout turned L.A.'s
freeways into a parking lot,

19:04.621 --> 19:06.884
and people are getting violent,
so business as usual.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.191
Mac, how much time
do we have to evacuate the city

19:09.235 --> 19:10.888
before meltdown?

19:10.932 --> 19:13.195
[indistinct shouting]

19:13.239 --> 19:14.457
MacGYVER:
Uh, it's hard to say.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.503
I mean, the core temperature
is rising fast,

19:16.546 --> 19:19.201
but not at a steady rate.
It's all over the place.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.420
And at what temperature
does the core melt down?

19:20.463 --> 19:22.944
3,270 degrees
Fahrenheit.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.512
So, uh, best guess,
five or six hours.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.644
MATTY:
People will never
get out in time.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.342
Once the public gets word
of what's happening,

19:29.385 --> 19:32.127
panic will cost lives
before a meltdown.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.216
I'm ordering
an information blackout.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.393
News of the situation at the
nuclear plant cannot get out.

19:37.437 --> 19:41.223
Is this clear? Crystal. Riley, how can we stop
your hacker friend?

19:41.267 --> 19:42.529
I don't know.
Kai has control.

19:42.572 --> 19:45.140
I... [sighs] I just let her in.Riley...

19:45.184 --> 19:46.359

I can't get,

20:20.393 --> 20:22.395
So we can hear!

20:27.095 --> 20:28.923
Here's Reactor
One's coolant pump.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.968
Which does what exactly?Okay,

20:31.012 --> 20:32.143
think of a nuclear power plant

20:32.187 --> 20:34.189
like, uh, a really high-tech
teakettle.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.931
A fission reaction creates steam
which rises, spinning a turbine,

20:36.974 --> 20:38.324
generating electricity.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.499
This pump moves seawater

20:39.542 --> 20:41.283
through the core
to keep it cool.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.459
Well, it did until
the hackers turned it off.MacGYVER: Right, so,

20:43.503 --> 20:45.983
to delay the meltdown, what we
need to do is create a new pump,

20:46.027 --> 20:47.681
one that is separate from the
plant's computer system,

20:47.724 --> 20:49.117
one that will
move seawater

20:49.160 --> 20:51.554
from the ocean
to the reactor's core.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.252
O-Okay. Let's say we can.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.558
If the water evaporates
too quickly...

20:55.602 --> 20:57.386
Yeah, the fuel casings will heat
up, interact with the steam,

20:57.430 --> 20:58.692
and split the hydrogen.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.128
And then we're dealing
with a combustible gas.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.172
As in kaboom?

21:01.216 --> 21:03.174
As in Fukushima.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.698
That's a bit risky.Yes,

21:04.741 --> 21:06.047
but Riley needs
more time to find Kai.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.875
This will give
it to her.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.093

21:09.137 --> 21:10.791

in the parking lot.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.360
I'm gonna need their
blades and their motors.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.187

22:46.103 --> 22:47.409
What do you mean?Well, I mean,

22:47.453 --> 22:48.889
she's hiding
from forensic experts

22:48.932 --> 22:50.238
and law enforcement, right?

22:50.281 --> 22:53.459
What do you know about her
that they don't?

22:56.723 --> 22:58.246
Pork buns.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.509
Come again?

23:00.553 --> 23:02.511
Pork buns.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.513
She-she was obsessed with
them, she ate 'em every day.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.646
I can cross-reference

23:06.689 --> 23:08.387
the physical locations
of these IP addresses

23:08.430 --> 23:10.301
with dim sum orders
from food delivery apps.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.303
Yes, Desi!

23:12.347 --> 23:14.305
[indistinct shouting]

23:30.452 --> 23:31.975
The other end of the hose

23:32.019 --> 23:34.282
is connected to the Jet Ski
in the water...

23:34.325 --> 23:35.979
is a sentence I never
thought I'd say.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.154
My guy's ready
to turn it on

23:37.198 --> 23:38.460
whenever we say so.

23:38.504 --> 23:42.116
All right, well,
no time like the present.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.161
Do it.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.250
[engine whirring]

23:56.347 --> 23:58.785
[alarm sounding][indistinct chatter]

23:58.828 --> 24:00.177
LASKY:
Hey.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.397
My techs say the core temp
acceleration has slowed.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.572
Nice work.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.749
More good news.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.795
Riley and Desi say they have
a lead on Kai's location.

24:08.838 --> 24:11.624
Yeah, that's-that's great.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.103
What's the matter?

24:13.147 --> 24:14.670
You're doing that looking off
into the distance thing

24:14.714 --> 24:17.064
as if you've lost your horse
at the Ponderosa.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.458
Okay, so Riley said
that Kai's M.O.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.329
was hacking for money, which
means that she was hired

24:21.372 --> 24:22.809
by someone with deep pockets.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.202
Someone who we know wants
to cause mass destruction.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.727
Codex.
Yes.

24:27.770 --> 24:28.902
I mean, nuclear meltdown
sure seems

24:28.945 --> 24:30.033
like a page from their playbook.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.382
Well, that's true,
but they don't

24:31.426 --> 24:32.775
exactly have
the market cornered.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.734
It could be terrorists,
hostile governments, anyone.

24:34.777 --> 24:37.345
I'm telling you, Russ,
something's happening here.

24:37.388 --> 24:40.130
And we need to be ready for it.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.657
[helicopter blades whirring,
sirens wailing]

24:57.452 --> 24:59.410
Are you sure this is the place?

24:59.454 --> 25:00.673
It's a crazy amount of bandwidth

25:00.716 --> 25:01.978
considering we're
in the middle of a blackout.

25:04.981 --> 25:07.070
Not to mention those.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.987
So, where's Kai?

25:12.249 --> 25:14.295
[high-pitched beep]

25:14.338 --> 25:15.905
Get down!

25:15.949 --> 25:17.341
[grunting]

25:33.488 --> 25:34.576
[panting]

25:34.620 --> 25:36.056
Riley?

25:36.099 --> 25:38.580
I know. We have a lot to
talk about, but right now

25:38.624 --> 25:40.626
I need your laptop so I
can stop the meltdown.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.105
What meltdown?

25:42.149 --> 25:44.020
Look, we already know you
used Nemesis to own the grid

25:44.064 --> 25:46.240
and then took control of the
San Eurosia Nuclear Power Plant.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.807
I didn't do anything
to a reactor.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.809
I got paid to hack into the DWP.
That's it.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.245
You know,
we don't have time for this.

25:51.288 --> 25:52.594
I'm telling the truth!

25:52.638 --> 25:54.770
Riley, look at me.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.860
Then we need a name, Kai, now.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.254
I can't give you one.Riley...

26:00.297 --> 26:02.865
No, I... I can't give you one
because I don't know.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.519
It was through
a Dark Web protocol.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.392
Whoever it was made sure
they'd never be found.

26:16.662 --> 26:17.793
[alarm sounding]

26:19.839 --> 26:23.016
That was Desi.
They've hit a dead end.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.452
Well, at least it's slowed down,

26:24.495 --> 26:26.149
thanks to your
Jet Ski pump.

26:26.193 --> 26:28.021
Yeah, but not
slow enough.

26:28.064 --> 26:29.892
In less than an hour,
this reactor is gonna have

26:29.936 --> 26:32.765
its own chapter
in the history books.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.418
Where's Lasky?

26:34.462 --> 26:36.377
Uh, he was here
just a minute...

26:36.420 --> 26:37.596
Mac?

26:39.380 --> 26:40.424
BOZER:
What do we do?

26:40.468 --> 26:41.600
What's the call?

26:41.643 --> 26:43.036
We're going to alert FEMA
and the NRC

26:43.079 --> 26:44.777
that there's
a radiological emergency.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.865
They'll set
up a 50-mile

26:45.908 --> 26:47.518
EPZ around the reactor.

26:47.562 --> 26:48.607
We're giving up?

26:48.650 --> 26:50.260
No. But if we can't stop it,

26:50.304 --> 26:52.349
we have to save as
many lives as we can.

26:53.699 --> 26:54.874
KAI:
It was a blast

26:54.917 --> 26:56.440
hanging with you and Peyton
for a while,

26:56.484 --> 26:59.443
but nothing lasts forever.

26:59.487 --> 27:02.664
Oh, come on, Kai.
It was more than that.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.797
I'm not a white hat hacker,
Riley.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.625
I do it for the money.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.235
I do it for the thrill.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.758
I think you know
what that's like.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.194
That's not who I am anymore.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.022
Sure.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.545
DESI:
Matty's calling FEMA.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.635
They've slowed it down,
but they can't stop it.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.637
Four million people.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.814
Four million?
What do you mean four million?

27:21.857 --> 27:24.033
They're all gonna die?

27:24.077 --> 27:26.296
It's a nuclear meltdown in one
of the most populated cities

27:26.340 --> 27:27.994
in the country.
Yeah, we're all gonna die.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't sign
up for an Armageddon.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.171
[sighs]:
Oh-- okay, so, look.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.826
I... I might have done something
you told me to never do.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.828
I left a bread crumb
in the code.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.699
Actually, an Evercookie.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.005
Are you serious?

27:39.048 --> 27:40.920
In my payment receipt,
I can ping an IMEI number.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.966
All I got was "cookie."

27:44.010 --> 27:46.969
Whoever's behind this,
I can trace their cell phone.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.322
[alarm sounding]

27:53.672 --> 27:55.195
TAYLOR:
Mac!

27:55.238 --> 27:57.240
[metal clattering]

28:03.899 --> 28:05.553
What happened?This seam ruptured.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.686
Hand me the duct tape.

28:15.650 --> 28:16.738
What is it?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.740
Not here. Come on.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.136
The pump was sabotaged.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.486
What? You don't know that.

28:25.529 --> 28:27.706
The tape could have loosened
from the pressure.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.620
Do I really have to
spell this out for you?

28:29.664 --> 28:31.448
Kai said she was hired
by an anonymous group,

28:31.492 --> 28:33.146
and Codex always has
someone on the inside.

28:33.189 --> 28:35.061
Is it possible? Yes.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.671
Or you could just be
jumping to conclusions.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.543
How could you, of all people,
be so blind?

28:39.587 --> 28:41.502
Because this isn't your instinct
talking, nor your experience

28:41.545 --> 28:43.156
nor your logic. This is trauma.

28:43.199 --> 28:45.593
Oh, spare me. Isn't there
some sort of taboo in psyops

28:45.636 --> 28:47.160
against analyzing
your coworkers 24-7?

28:47.203 --> 28:48.944
I am trying to talk to you
as a friend.

28:48.988 --> 28:50.380
Instead of taking
even one second

28:50.424 --> 28:51.599
to deal
with your father's death,

28:51.642 --> 28:52.818
you're putting
all your energies

28:52.861 --> 28:54.733
into some sort
of Codex paranoia.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.691
I am trying to help you, Angus.You want to
be helpful?

28:56.735 --> 28:57.997
Why don't you keep
an eye on the pump?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.476
I'll go find
our saboteur.

29:05.134 --> 29:06.788
Someone over there
has the laptop

29:06.832 --> 29:08.355
with control
of the nuclear plant.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.574
Okay. We going in
guns blazing or ninja style?

29:10.618 --> 29:13.099
Not knowing what we're up
against, my vote's for ninjas.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.448
Let's go.

29:14.491 --> 29:15.536
Wait, you're just
gonna leave me?

29:16.711 --> 29:17.625
What if...We fail and you die

29:17.668 --> 29:19.235
along with the rest of us

29:19.279 --> 29:21.237
in a nuclear meltdown
that you helped cause?

29:21.281 --> 29:22.673
Kick some ass.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.334
LASKY:
You have to stop
calling me here.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.821
WOMAN:
All right. Let's get everything
loaded up ASAP.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.736
Almost ready.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.660
There's the laptop.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.838
I told you, this
isn't smart.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.013
I'm gonna get caught.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.798
I promise to call
when I know more.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.843
I have to get back
before I'm missed.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.976
[both grunting]

30:07.762 --> 30:09.590
How could you do that?I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I had no choice.

30:09.633 --> 30:10.721
Sabotaging that pump
means millions of lives

30:10.765 --> 30:11.810
are on your hands!

30:13.812 --> 30:15.161
[gun cocks]

30:15.204 --> 30:17.076
Stop right there.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.729
What? Sabotage?

30:18.773 --> 30:20.514
You really think Codex is gonna
save the world by destroying it?

30:20.557 --> 30:22.559
Codex? What?
I-I don't know what that is.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.387
I was on the phone
with my wife.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.520
I know there was an
information blackout,

30:26.563 --> 30:27.956
but I have to get my
kids out. I just have to.

30:29.958 --> 30:33.048
WOMAN [over phone]:
Phil? Phil, are you there?

30:35.355 --> 30:36.704
Peyton?

30:36.747 --> 30:38.488
I don't understand.

30:38.532 --> 30:41.056
I'm only trying to make
the world safe.

30:42.536 --> 30:45.974
It's "time to kick things
up a notch."

30:46.018 --> 30:47.367
I'm sorry.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.499
[new alarm blaring]

30:52.851 --> 30:55.462
[overlapping shouting]

31:02.382 --> 31:04.514
It's the hydrogen sensor.TAYLOR: Is this the thing
we talked about earlier

31:04.558 --> 31:06.386
but decided to
deal with later?

31:06.429 --> 31:08.736
If we don't expunge the hydrogen
from the core,

31:08.779 --> 31:11.652
the containment wall will blow
and spray a radioactive cloud

31:11.695 --> 31:14.568
over all of Southern California.

31:14.611 --> 31:17.310
Lasky, I'm sorry. I think you
should call your wife back.

31:17.353 --> 31:18.833
I'll do it later.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.141
Please, I think
you should do it now.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.455
[alarms blaring]

31:36.285 --> 31:37.504
Get everyone out.

31:37.547 --> 31:40.246
Take the truck.
We're running out of time.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.595
I won't be long.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.379
This isn't you.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.642
You don't see
the big picture yet,

31:45.686 --> 31:47.122
but this is
just like before.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.211
I'm doing
my civic duty.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.996
It's the only way
to save the world.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.693
By endangering lives?

31:55.522 --> 31:58.351
Can't get hold
of Desi or Riley.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.569
What do we do?

31:59.613 --> 32:00.962
We believe that
they'll come through,

32:01.006 --> 32:02.790
and the moment that they do,
we drop the control rods

32:02.833 --> 32:03.965
and turn on
the coolant pumps.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.489
As long as that gauge
doesn't hit 3,270,

32:06.533 --> 32:08.317
we can stop
the meltdown.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.624
Don't we still have the problem
of too much hydrogen in the core

32:10.667 --> 32:11.755
leading to a deadly
radioactive explosion?

32:11.799 --> 32:13.366
Thanks for the reminder,
Debbie Downer.

32:13.409 --> 32:14.715
Yes, well, I'm British.
We're taught

32:14.758 --> 32:16.238
from a very early age
to be disappointed.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.066
Wait a second.
What-what if we open the valves

32:18.110 --> 32:20.242
and flood nitrogen gas
into the reactor?

32:20.286 --> 32:22.723
Which would expunge the hydrogen
and prevent an explosion.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.290
Exactly. I'll go.
Wait!

32:24.333 --> 32:26.335
Nobody knows this plant better
than me.Yeah, but, Lasky,

32:26.379 --> 32:28.555
you have a family.
I'm not letting you go.If I'm putting

32:28.598 --> 32:31.166
my kids' lives in someone's
hands, it's gonna be mine.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.739
Well, it's up to Riley now.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.483
This country's cybersecurity
is pathetic.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.137
I saw it first
with Nemesis.

32:45.180 --> 32:48.270
A couple lines of code, and the
whole world comes crashing down.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.794
But then
I remembered,

32:50.838 --> 32:52.927
the only way to fix
the problem is to...

32:52.971 --> 32:55.408
[echoing]: Show them
they have something to lose.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.976
When the world
sees what happens

32:58.019 --> 33:00.848
here today,
they will finally understand

33:00.891 --> 33:02.110
what needs to be done.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.808
You know, when I started
working at Phoenix,

33:04.852 --> 33:07.898
I felt really lucky
I'd been given a second chance

33:07.942 --> 33:09.074
to be more like you.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.032
Meanwhile, here I was thinking

33:11.076 --> 33:12.425
Riley Davis was
right all along.

33:13.861 --> 33:15.863
The world is just
shades of gray.

33:19.432 --> 33:20.737
[grunting]

33:24.654 --> 33:26.308
It's done.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.180
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.485
Up against the car.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.749
[alarms blaring][overlapping shouting]

33:35.926 --> 33:37.885
TECH:
We've got about two minutes
until meltdown.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.760
The guts are still running.

33:43.804 --> 33:44.935
She only hit the screen.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.829
Here goes
everything.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.703
[beeping]

34:13.747 --> 34:14.922
We have control of the system.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.967
Engage M5-10.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.752
Let's take it
into hot standby mode.

34:18.795 --> 34:21.233
What's going on?
They're, uh,
starting the reactor

34:21.276 --> 34:22.843
coolant pumps and
inserting the control rods

34:22.886 --> 34:25.019
to lower the
core temperature.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.543
She did it.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.591
What's wrong?
Hit the scram button.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.462
There's a built-in
safety measure.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.247
Lowering the control rods at
this temperature will seal

34:35.290 --> 34:36.987
the reactor room door.And Lasky will be trapped.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.338
Well, just let him out
after you save the city.

34:39.381 --> 34:41.209
No, no, no, a part of the
by-product of the interaction

34:41.253 --> 34:42.602
between hydrogen and nitrogen

34:42.645 --> 34:44.212
is all the oxygen gets
sucked out of the room.

34:44.256 --> 34:46.258
If we close the doors,
Lasky will suffocate.

34:46.301 --> 34:49.870
Well, I'm gonna go get him.No, no, no,
there's no time. Look.

34:51.698 --> 34:55.267
It's him, or it's the city.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.575
TECH:
What do I do?

35:08.018 --> 35:10.630
We can't save everyone.

35:15.635 --> 35:16.940
[new alarm blaring]

35:25.906 --> 35:27.908
TECH:
Reactor room doors
are sealed.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.828
Control rods
are down.

35:34.871 --> 35:37.352
Core temp
holding steady.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.708
Now dropping.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.539
[gasping]

35:56.241 --> 35:59.200
I'm getting green lights.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.398
It's over.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.203
I made the call
to Lasky's family.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.769
Took care of all
the arrangements.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.467
They'll be looked after,
but, of course,

36:48.510 --> 36:51.252
nothing will ever
be enough.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.254
Any word from Angus?

36:53.298 --> 36:55.691
He hasn't responded to any texts

36:55.735 --> 36:58.390
or calls.
MATTY: Well,

36:58.433 --> 37:00.696
if there's any silver lining,

37:00.740 --> 37:02.002
I just got word

37:02.045 --> 37:03.656
from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.223
They're overhauling

37:05.266 --> 37:08.791
security at every one of their
nuclear plants in the country.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.185
[jail cell door clangs shut]

37:11.229 --> 37:14.536
I was expecting more of a medal
than a jail cell.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.669
I did help save the city,
after all.

37:16.712 --> 37:19.802
My boss has some pull.
I'll make sure they take that

37:19.846 --> 37:21.108
into consideration
at sentencing.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.806
And if Phoenix happens
to have another one

37:23.850 --> 37:25.373
of those pardons
lying around,

37:25.417 --> 37:27.680
I'd gladly accept.

37:27.723 --> 37:32.467
If I hadn't insisted we get
involved with The Collective,

37:32.511 --> 37:34.643
you two wouldn't be on
the wrong side of this glass.

37:34.687 --> 37:38.038
Okay, cool it with the whole
butterfly effect thing.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.561
These were my choices,

37:39.605 --> 37:42.738
and I'm prepared to
face the consequences.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.612
But I need your help
with one thing.

37:52.531 --> 37:55.925
I need you to smuggle
something in here for me.

37:55.969 --> 37:58.188
Two orders barbecue pork buns?

37:58.232 --> 38:00.756
[chuckles]Anything for my sis.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.893
[ball bouncing]

38:14.161 --> 38:17.338
You, uh...

38:17.382 --> 38:19.427
you don't lock
your door anymore?

38:19.471 --> 38:22.691
World's ending.
Haven't you heard?

38:28.262 --> 38:31.439
What if it's true?

38:31.483 --> 38:33.528
What if we can't save everyone?

38:36.836 --> 38:39.055
We'll, uh...

38:41.710 --> 38:44.626
We'll find a way, Angus.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.019
No one has to die.

38:46.062 --> 38:48.848
Tell that to Lasky.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.072
When I was nine,

38:56.116 --> 38:58.423
I took apart the engine
of my dad's jeep.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.817
When he, uh,

39:01.861 --> 39:03.732
came down for work,
he said,

39:03.776 --> 39:07.388
"Well, I guess we know what
you're doing for your summer."

39:07.432 --> 39:09.738
[chuckles]

39:09.782 --> 39:12.785
He probably could've put
it back together in a day,

39:12.828 --> 39:15.831
but he wanted me to learn.

39:15.875 --> 39:19.226
Took me seven weeks.

39:19.269 --> 39:22.360
He took the bus to work
that whole time.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.412
What is that?

39:31.456 --> 39:34.633
My dad left a, a goodbye.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.593
I've been trying to for days,

39:38.637 --> 39:40.856
but I just can't bring myself
to watch it.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.206
Why not?

39:43.250 --> 39:45.861
Because it's all I've got left.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.737
Once I watch this, then, uh,

39:51.780 --> 39:53.869
he's gone forever.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.961
He's gone, my mom's gone.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.137
I'm all alone.

40:03.139 --> 40:06.055
You're not alone, Angus.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.587
I'll watch it with you. Come on.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.077
Angus,

40:28.121 --> 40:31.646
if you're watching this, then...

40:31.690 --> 40:33.866
you know.

40:33.909 --> 40:37.130
I wish that there was,

40:37.173 --> 40:39.915
there was more time for us,

40:39.959 --> 40:41.961
but I need you
to listen to something

40:42.004 --> 40:43.919
very carefully right now.

40:43.963 --> 40:48.489
44, eight, two, 12,

40:48.533 --> 40:52.101
11, 75, seven,

40:52.145 --> 40:55.496
31, 51, 77,

40:55.540 --> 40:58.847
two, 11, 38, 53,

40:58.891 --> 41:03.548
51, 77, two, 11.

41:03.591 --> 41:06.028
You got that, son?

41:08.204 --> 41:09.554
Whoa.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.518
So much for closure.
