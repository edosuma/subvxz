WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:03.637
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 All righty, diving in--
 Jane and Michael were planning

00:03.671 --> 00:05.239
a wedding...
Will you marry me?
Yes!

00:05.273 --> 00:06.774
...and it was going
 to be at the house, but then

00:06.807 --> 00:10.111
this happened. Luckily,
 Rogelio came to the rescue

00:10.144 --> 00:13.781
and he built them a model
 of the house on the soundstage,

00:13.814 --> 00:14.915
and the family
 moved into the Marbella.

00:14.948 --> 00:19.053
And all was well until
 Jane's bachelorette party,

00:19.087 --> 00:22.190
when this happened.
Mom?

00:22.223 --> 00:23.424
Jane, I'm sorry.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.459
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, and speaking
 of family drama,

00:25.493 --> 00:27.395
Rafael finally bonded
 with his long-lost brother.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.097
Only problem?

00:29.130 --> 00:32.333
After a night of drinking
 he acted on an insider tip.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.202
I just made $5 million.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.537
So, we should probably get
our stories straight, right?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.072
Brandon knew they
had the patent

00:38.106 --> 00:39.273
before they announced
it this morning.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.641
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I know!

00:40.674 --> 00:42.643
Bad news, right?
 Well, how about this?

00:42.676 --> 00:45.513
I'm sorry.
I don't want
your apology, Mom.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.616
At this point, you are just
a cautionary tale.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.751
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know!
 I hate that they're fighting.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.753
Let's hope it ends soon.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.556
You'll recall
 when Jane was young,

00:55.589 --> 00:58.659
she fell in love...

00:58.692 --> 01:01.762
with salsa.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.099
And right away, well...

01:05.132 --> 01:07.101
she was ready to go steady.

01:07.135 --> 01:10.204
Please, please, please.
Just consider it.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.745
Because I know I love salsa.
When I saw it,

01:17.778 --> 01:19.747
it spoke to my soul.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.483
You know what,

01:22.516 --> 01:23.684
let's do it.

01:23.717 --> 01:24.718
What?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.086
It spoke
to her soul.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.656
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But alas,
 the conversation was short.

01:28.689 --> 01:32.226
Because while Jane
 loved watching salsa,

01:32.260 --> 01:35.563
it turned out
 she hated dancing salsa.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.265
Like, seriously hated it.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.404
But I'm terrible.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.806
Please don't make me.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.841
Oh, come on,
she's miserable.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.784
Yeah, you're right.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.919
Come on, we don't want
to miss the warm-ups.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.589
Don't worry, you
don't have to perform.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.856
What?

02:02.890 --> 02:05.826
Screw principle.
Let's have an adventure.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.828
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And so they Thelma and Louised
 it out of there.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.830
And that night
 solidified one thing:

02:09.863 --> 02:12.800
Jane hated dancing salsa.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.835
But she loved her mother.

02:17.205 --> 02:20.741
Until... everything changed.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.211
(salsa music playing)
(exclaims)

02:23.244 --> 02:25.213
See, recently,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.215
salsa became
 an obsession once again.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.218
Tonight I am not just
dancing for myself.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.320
I am dancing for Cuba!

02:32.353 --> 02:35.323
No way.
That line is ridiculous.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.825
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 At least for a character

02:37.858 --> 02:39.227
in Jane's novel-in-progress.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.563
Okay, much better.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.832
Yeah.
I would definitely say that.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.468
With lust in my eyes.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.303
(door opens)
MICHAEL: You sure you
want to take two cars?

02:49.337 --> 02:52.306
And she was also--
 how to put this...

02:52.340 --> 02:53.774
Positive. I don't
want to ride with her.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.376
...hating her mother.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.777
Got it.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.712
(door closes)
We have five minutes.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.980
Back to me.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.584
I was heaving passionately.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.885
Mm.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.759
What?

03:14.695 --> 03:15.963
(elevator bell dings)

03:20.000 --> 03:23.504
So, listen, I was
thinking about

03:23.537 --> 03:24.772
this fight with your mom,

03:24.805 --> 03:26.507
and, I don't know,
maybe it's time

03:26.540 --> 03:28.676
for a cease-fire there.
I know she crossed a line.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.345
Oh, when she got trashed
and made out with Lina's guy?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.580
She did apologize.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.614
And I always forgive her.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.648
That's the problem.

03:34.682 --> 03:35.816
XIOMARA:
 The problem is

03:35.849 --> 03:37.951
what Jane said
when I apologized.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.020
She called me a cautionary tale.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.021
And I meant what I said.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.022
She's my daughter.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.292
I'm just sick of having
to act like her mother.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.427
She can't talk
to me like that.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.829
You know, she can't
behave like that.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.507
See you there?
Oh, uh-huh.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.409
(both sigh)

04:01.442 --> 04:03.344
Can you say "mama"?

04:03.377 --> 04:04.478
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here, now.

04:04.512 --> 04:05.679
To the Villanueva house.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.415
Abuela.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.517
Abuela.
Mama.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.557
Fine. Go ahead.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.526
I said everything
I wanted to yesterday.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.527
And you're not gonna apologize?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.629
Apologize? Me?

04:21.661 --> 04:22.696
Hello, hello.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.035
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Sorry, I can't remember

04:28.068 --> 04:30.371
her last name.
 It's not important.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.705
JANE: Hello, Tammy.
Hey, Tammy.

04:31.739 --> 04:32.773
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 The point is, she's

04:32.806 --> 04:33.974
their insurance adjuster.
Okay, so

04:34.007 --> 04:36.510
let's see where we are
in terms of damages.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.079
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'm no expert but I'd say the
 damage is pretty substantial.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.314
Thank you, baby.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.351
Please, come in.
Thank you.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.723
Don't hold your breath
waiting for me to apologize.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.394
What I will do is have
a serious discussion

04:53.427 --> 04:55.663
about your behavior.
Okay, wow.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.732
Wow. Uh, here's the
good news. You have insurance.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.601
Don't talk to me
like I'm a five-year-old.
Which means you'll get

05:00.634 --> 05:02.102
I'm sorry. Uh, you're not
a five-year-old.
a nice chunk of change

05:02.135 --> 05:03.837
to fix this place up.
Maybe an update?
You're more
like a 16-year-old.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.777
She doesn't get a vote,
she's leaving.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.878
Just keep Mom's room
the same,

05:10.911 --> 05:12.646
because she's gonna
live here forever.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.055
XIOMARA:
Bye, Tammy.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.094
Come on, Ma,
I'll drive you to work.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.963
Hello? Did you forget that
you said that you'd watch Mateo?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.900
Oh. I thought you didn't want me
taking care of your child.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.368
Since I'm so

05:34.402 --> 05:35.503
immature and irresponsible.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.070
Stop. You're on the schedule,

05:37.104 --> 05:38.772
and I need to meet
with my advisor.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.641
Not my problem.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.642
Xiomara.
No, it's fine,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.511
Abuela.
He doesn't need to learn

05:43.544 --> 05:45.546
how to pound shots
before he can walk.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.382
(engine starts)

05:48.416 --> 05:51.051
Oh, okay, this is bad.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.653
My schedule's gonna implode.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.887
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah yes, the sacred

05:53.921 --> 05:57.124
child care schedule. What every
 working parent relies on.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.560
Jane's is, of course,
 more elaborate than most.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.795
I'll watch Mateo.
Really?

06:01.829 --> 06:03.764
Yeah, I'd love to.
Are you kidding?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.399
I told you, I used
to watch my cousin's kids.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.401
I know what I'm doing.
Just send me the list.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.970
What lists?
Don't "what list" me,
I know there's a list

06:10.003 --> 06:11.672
of instructions
you're dying to send me.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.441
Just e-mail them to me,
I want to do this right.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.042
The more detail the better.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.510
You're really
turning me on right now.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.711
(grunts loudly)

06:17.745 --> 06:18.746
(gasps)

06:18.779 --> 06:20.180
(Jane giggles)

06:20.213 --> 06:22.049
(phone chimes)

06:23.951 --> 06:25.185
It's your dad again.
I'm supposed to remind you

06:25.218 --> 06:27.555
to pick out your
wedding dress by Thursday

06:27.588 --> 06:28.922
and see if you looked
at something called

06:28.956 --> 06:30.991
a Lauren Conrad
wedding calendar.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.660
Oh...
(phone chimes)

06:47.841 --> 06:49.443
(knocking at door)

06:51.044 --> 06:52.480
Hello, Rogelio.
Oh, uh, hello,

06:52.513 --> 06:54.482
dear network executives.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.516
Please, come in.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.785
(laughs nervously)

06:57.818 --> 06:59.186
To what do I owe
this pleasant surprise?

06:59.219 --> 07:00.521
We're here because of

07:00.554 --> 07:01.789
the new set you built.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.056
The house.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.492
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.826
Rogelio's grand gesture.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.194
Here's where
you're getting married.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.862
And, as you can see,
the reception

07:08.896 --> 07:11.732
will spill out
onto the soundstage.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.001
You cannot use the crew
for personal reasons.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.836
I don't know what you heard,

07:15.869 --> 07:17.705
but I did not

07:17.738 --> 07:19.707
use the crew

07:19.740 --> 07:21.208
for personal reasons.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.543
I had them
build the house

07:22.576 --> 07:24.612
for Tiago's next adventure,
of course.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.881
Tiago travels through time
to epic moments in history.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.583
This week he kills baby Hitler.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.151
What epic event

07:31.184 --> 07:33.120
can possibly be filmed
in that house?

07:33.153 --> 07:36.557
It's an epic idea

07:36.590 --> 07:38.158
told in a small,
slice-of-life story.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.860
As Mark Twain said,

07:39.893 --> 07:42.496
art is holding
a mirror up to nature.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.464
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It was actually Shakespeare.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.134
So what's the idea?

07:47.167 --> 07:48.736
No, no.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.138
Another famous saying:
show, don't tell.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.608
But trust me, the story
will knock your socks off.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.710
Mind-blowing
telenovela twists,

07:56.744 --> 07:59.513
but the kind that
everyone can relate to.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.982
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Like being stressed
 because you got drunk

08:02.015 --> 08:04.752
and made $5 million
 in an accidental insider trade.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.019
Totally relatable.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.220
(knocking at door)
Excuse me, Mr. Solano?

08:07.254 --> 08:08.722
Barbara Fairwick's on line one.

08:08.756 --> 08:09.890
Barbara?

08:10.724 --> 08:13.093
Okay, thank you.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.194
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Who's this Barbara Fairwick

08:14.227 --> 08:15.596
that's got him so excited?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.965
Barbara. How are you?

08:17.998 --> 08:18.899
Really?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.233
Find Petra. Now.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.836
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes. Petra.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.272
That shower.
Warm water, whole time.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.107
I feel like Ottokar the First.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.114
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oops. There she is.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.216
In other relatable
 telenovela twists,

08:36.249 --> 08:38.751
Petra's secret twin
 showed up and...

08:38.785 --> 08:41.288
Wait, I should show, not tell.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.123
Here's where we left off.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.558
Oh, my God.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.560
My long-lost sister.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.229
It's you. It's really you.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.564
Oh!

08:52.733 --> 08:55.102
Hey! I do that, too.
Jumping when scared.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.137
I need personal space.
Sometimes I scratch.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.045
And all my life,
thinking I have no family.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.714
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.650
W... Where did you live?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.251
Orphanage.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.854
You seeing
the movie Annie?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.122
Like that.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.124
Only no nice
Miss Hannigan for us.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.992
And my Sandy was a rat.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.360
You think I-I can

09:20.393 --> 09:23.664
bother you for
a little bit more food?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.966
Then I living in room
with ten women

09:25.999 --> 09:27.735
and one bring home magazine

09:27.768 --> 09:30.103
and they saying it looks
like me, only beautiful.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.005
It was you.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.206
(slurps)

09:33.240 --> 09:34.274
So then

09:34.307 --> 09:36.744
I go to government building

09:36.777 --> 09:38.011
and I find two
certificate of birth.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.147
So then I sell goat

09:40.180 --> 09:41.849
and I have money
to come here.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.952
Well, that's...
quite the story.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.687
Oh, you...

09:46.720 --> 09:49.022
you still have some, uh,
chocolate on your finger.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.257
No, uh, hair dye.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.692
I fix for you.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.993
(laughs)

09:53.026 --> 09:54.762
Roots make me
look like old lady.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.396
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes. Prematurely gray.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.633
It happens when you've lived
 a hard knock life.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.836
Which brings us back here.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.972
I change, then I start to clean.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.239
No, I get.
No, no! Wait.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.375
Leaping lizards.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.043
Petra, I just talked
to Barbara and it's true.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.745
She's selling
the Fairwick.
(squeaks)

10:11.779 --> 10:12.913
PETRA:
Anezka!

10:12.946 --> 10:14.181
Why don't you
go get changed?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.283
RAFAEL:
Wait...

10:16.316 --> 10:17.951
What the...?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.021
Wow.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.156
This is unbelievable.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.925
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And yet, somehow,
 just believable enough.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.260
I guess twins really do
run in your family.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.929
Oh, my God. Thank God
my postpartum medication

10:28.962 --> 10:31.331
also helps with anxiety.

10:31.364 --> 10:35.936
Wait, so Barbara really
wants to sell the Fairwick?
Yep.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.738
Lachlan overspent
on construction, she fired him,

10:37.771 --> 10:39.673
and now she just wants out.
Which means

10:39.707 --> 10:42.009
I can scoop it up at a fire
sale, increase our beachfront.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.011
And it's got the golf club,
which is guaranteed revenue.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.747
You can stop floating
the Marbella.
And then our views

10:46.780 --> 10:48.682
will never be blocked.

10:48.716 --> 10:49.917
Can you afford it?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.685
Not sure.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.954
But I am meeting
with my money managers.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.690
JANE:
 Wish me luck

10:56.724 --> 10:58.191
with my advisor.
MICHAEL:
Luck!

10:58.225 --> 11:00.327
And as for why
you're really calling, Mateo

11:00.360 --> 11:03.697
is fine. We're just sitting
here, reading books.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.232
You are not.
Okay.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.035
We're superheroes. And
anticipating your next question,

11:08.068 --> 11:09.903
he ate mashed up
blueberries

11:09.937 --> 11:12.105
and smeared them on his onesie.
Oh, no.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.107
Not the one that Glamma bought.
Yeah.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.376
But I consulted
your List Number Three,

11:16.409 --> 11:18.178
Subcategory Laundry,
Item Number Four.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.847
Used Dreft: Active Baby,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.849
good as new.
Amazing.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.384
You're amazing. Thank you
so much for babysitting.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.253
Of course.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.889
Uh, good luck
with Professor Donaldson.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.891
(groans)

11:30.924 --> 11:32.125
Well, it still feels
a little flat.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.426
And, like,
all about

11:33.460 --> 11:35.395
romance.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.064
Well,

11:37.097 --> 11:38.899
it-it is a romance novel.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.469
I just wish the work
incorporated

11:42.502 --> 11:44.271
some critique of the genre.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.474
I mean, all this march to the
wedding stuff seems so outdated.

11:47.507 --> 11:50.477
Though it-it does take place
in 1962.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.279
Yeah, but we are
not living

11:52.312 --> 11:53.881
in that time period.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.749
("Wedding March" ringtone
playing)
Sorry.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.150
Oh, um...

11:57.184 --> 12:00.788
uh, my dad must've
changed my ringtone.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.457
(clears throat)

12:04.491 --> 12:06.126
I hear you.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.394
It feels flat.
And I will

12:07.427 --> 12:09.062
juice it up
and get you new pages

12:09.096 --> 12:10.931
and get this novel done
by deadline,

12:10.964 --> 12:13.801
no problem.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.468
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Then why does it feel
 like a problem?

12:15.502 --> 12:16.870
Hey.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.205
Nice suit.
Yeah.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.539
Turns out bankers want you
to look businesslike

12:19.572 --> 12:22.542
when you ask them to loan you
large sums of money.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.277
I might be buying
the Fairwick.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.079
What? Really?

12:26.113 --> 12:28.248
I can just scrape
together enough.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.184
It's a good investment,
you know, long-term.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.886
Well, I hope
it works out.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.788
And if you need
an extra couple hundred bucks...

12:34.822 --> 12:36.256
(laughs)
Thank you.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.391
I'll head up with you.
I'll say hi to Mateo.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.127
Sure.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.795
Michael's watching him.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.797
(elevator bell dings)

12:43.831 --> 12:46.199
Michael?
Yeah. Um,
my mom canceled,

12:46.233 --> 12:49.202
and you had
a meeting.
No, I totally get it.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.571
Just a little surprised.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.807
He's experienced with babies?

12:53.841 --> 12:56.043
Yeah, he actually is.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.011
Hmm, that's... that's great.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.347
(elevator bell dings)

13:00.380 --> 13:03.116
(gasps)
Hello. Hi!

13:03.150 --> 13:05.252
Who's that?
Daddy's here.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.488
Hi.
(kissing)

13:08.521 --> 13:09.522
How was it?
It was great.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.259
We had a lot of fun.
Oh.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.994
That's great. Hey, buddy.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.996
Come here.
Oh, come to Daddy.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.898
I missed you.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.400
And, friends, that's when Mateo
 said his first word.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.536
Da-da!

13:23.570 --> 13:26.573
Unfortunately, he said it
 to the wrong man.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.911
"Da" is one of those easier
sounds for a baby to make.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.279
Like, it-it
means nothing.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.914
Dada.
 We get it, Mateo.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.548
Enough. Stop showing off!

13:42.422 --> 13:43.556
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, here we are, with Jane.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.959
Trying to write.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.195
And move on
 from that Dada debacle.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.032
Geez.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.540
It should be noted that this is
 what Jane wanted to say...

14:00.573 --> 14:02.175
Oh, my God, Mom,

14:02.209 --> 14:04.978
Mateo called Michael
"Dada" in front of Rafael.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.181
And here's
 what she actually said.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.453
ROGELIO:
 Please,

14:13.486 --> 14:16.389
it's a small gesture.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.624
Why?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.563
Fine. I admit,

14:23.596 --> 14:26.033
I'm trying to sweet-talk you
into something.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.235
Well, I'm not an actor.
I don't thrill to my own image

14:28.268 --> 14:29.469
in quite the same way you do.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.072
Might I suggest Kylie's Lip Kit?

14:32.105 --> 14:34.942
Anyway, I'll cut
to the chase.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.545
I need a very special story
written for Tiago.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.680
So I thought, no,
who's the smartest,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.983
best writer I know?

14:44.017 --> 14:45.685
What's the story?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.087
It's about a house.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.557
A small, modest, ordinary house.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.328
Are you asking me
to base a story on a set?

14:55.362 --> 14:57.630
Yes, exactly.
Rogelio, that
is not how

14:57.664 --> 14:59.166
the writing process works.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.634
What about Titanic?
Based on a boat.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.304
Write me Titanic in a house.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.073
Please.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.208
My writers have produced
nothing but turds

15:08.241 --> 15:10.477
despite the many, many
motivating e-mails

15:10.510 --> 15:11.911
I have sent them.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.096
I want ten percent
above my quote.
Done.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.198
An executive producer credit.
Signed, sealed,
delivered.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.732
And I have a niece
who wants to act.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.501
What does
she look like?

15:34.534 --> 15:36.236
(laughing):
I'm just... I'm-I'm kidding.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.505
I'm kidding. She's hired.
It's a deal.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.374
And speaking of deals,

15:41.408 --> 15:44.377
Rafael and Petra
 were also hoping to make one.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.347
Barbara, thank you so much for
taking the time to meet with us.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.349
And I just want to reiterate
that our intention

15:49.382 --> 15:51.651
is to preserve the history
and integrity of the Fairwick.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.621
I get a good feeling
about you.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.989
Oh, stop.
I'm a hugger.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.324
Oh.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

15:57.357 --> 15:58.992
You, too,
sweetie.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.493
Oh. Mmm...
Oh...

16:00.527 --> 16:01.561
I will be in touch.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.332
(sighs)

16:05.365 --> 16:07.200
(whispering):
You were great.
You were great.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.402
Almost makes up for
the whole "dada" thing.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.438
Well, this dada just secured
his children's legacy.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.275
MATEO (babbling): Dada.
All right, Mateo.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.277
Shh. Nap time.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.279
(sighs)
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, finally.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.714
Time to make some progress
 on that rewrite.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.752
SALSA SOPHIA (laughing):
Oh, thank God.

16:25.785 --> 16:30.423
I knew our fight was
a misunderstanding.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.759
A few ballistic missiles
can't keep us apart.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.296
Please, Jane, I know that
Robert will propose soon.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.199
Friends,
 Jane was in the zone.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.201
Riding the wave. In the flow.

16:41.234 --> 16:44.071
And our bodies are so close
I can feel his heart beat.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.739
(knocking on door)
And just then there was
a knock at the door.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.475
What?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.243
Hey.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.212
Oh, my God, I lost track
of time. Is it 1:00?

16:52.245 --> 16:53.613
Sure is.
Okay.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.315
Good. Uh, he's napping,

16:55.348 --> 16:56.616
so I'll just go wake him.
Uh, wait, real quick.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.318
I just need to talk
to you about something.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.320
Mm-hmm?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.654
I want more time with Mateo.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.790
Three days a week
instead of two.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.458
Uh, is this because of
the whole "dada" thing?

17:05.492 --> 17:07.594
Because he's been calling
me "dada" all morning.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.396
It just brought up the fact

17:09.429 --> 17:11.397
that I want to be the man
most present in Mateo's life,

17:11.431 --> 17:13.266
and I think I should be.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.234
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.170
Um, you're his father.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.339
And speaking
 of a present father.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.574
Jane, surprise.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.576
Welcome to wedding central.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.546
Also known as Jane's
 office at school.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.515
Dad, what is going on?

17:28.548 --> 17:31.184
If the mountain will not come to
Muhammad, then Muhammad will...

17:31.218 --> 17:33.820
take seven different tiaras
to the mountain.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.289
You look beautiful.
DINA: Huh.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.725
DINA:
Maybe we could do a religious
conversion story for Tiago.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.793
No, no, no, no, no, no,
God is not sexy.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.796
Listen, we have fallen behind
LC's wedding pre-checklist.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.398
We have to make some decision.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.234
Here. What do you think?

17:47.267 --> 17:50.470
Dad, this is not a great time.
I have a meeting in ten minutes.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.140
That's all I need.
Jane, could you please look
at all this wedding stuff

17:53.173 --> 17:54.507
so I can get him to concentrate
on our script?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.609
Fine. Go, Dad.
What's on your checklist?

17:56.643 --> 17:58.545
First, please tell me
you and your mom went back

17:58.578 --> 18:00.380
to the dress shop.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.415
Well?

18:04.517 --> 18:07.787
I love it so much.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.524
Mom, you said that
about all three of them.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.526
WOMAN:
Take your time.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.894
Take some pictures.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.263
Sleep on it.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.165
No, not yet.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.267
Everyone knows that alterations
take at least a month.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.136
Okay, I'll go this week.
Jane.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.671
Why are you
and your mom fighting?

18:24.704 --> 18:25.805
MARLENE:
Nice tiara.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.675
Welcome to wedding central!

18:28.708 --> 18:30.843
Uh, Dad, this is my advisor.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.645
Great. Please advise Jane
on some wedding decisions.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.281
She has less
than six weeks.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.815
No, Dad, Marlene's
not really a wedding person.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.850
Oh, I see.

18:37.884 --> 18:38.651
Don't worry.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.620
There's still a
chance for you.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.921
Many people marry later in life.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.123
Don't lose hope.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.400
I just wanted to apologize
again for my dad.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.934
He did not mean to offend you.
I'm not offended.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.670
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You seem offended.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.507
Frankly, your assumption that I
would be offended is offensive.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.543
I don't want
to get married, Jane.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.613
So, please, don't put me in
your suffocating marriage plot.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.616
Got it.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.218
Sorry.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.585
My whole life is not built
around that goal.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.753
And neither is mine.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.322
Did I say it was?

19:15.355 --> 19:17.424
I mean, yeah, basically.
No.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.560
So about the chapter
that I sent you.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.695
(sighs)

19:22.729 --> 19:24.864
Well, it made me sad.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.367
But at least now
I have some context...

19:27.400 --> 19:29.469
I'm sorry. Can I ask you?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.871
Is your problem with me
or my writing?

19:31.904 --> 19:34.607
Both, frankly.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.976
Well, "frankly," I'm not
too thrilled with you either.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.645
But you know what,
lucky for both of us,

19:38.678 --> 19:41.548
it's almost the end of the year,
so we really don't have

19:41.581 --> 19:43.550
to put up with each other
that much longer.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.618
And speaking of
 longer-term problems...

19:45.652 --> 19:47.587
So you found each other.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.522
That's all you're
going to say, Mother?

19:49.556 --> 19:50.857
We need an
explanation.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.525
Explanation?

19:52.559 --> 19:56.529
I was pregnant, all alone,
behind Iron Curtain.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.532
I could not afford
one child, let alone two.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.234
So I pick pretty one.

20:01.268 --> 20:05.238
Plus you always were shaking.

20:05.272 --> 20:08.775
I-I have medical condition.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.582
Just when I think you can't
sink any lower, Mother,

20:15.615 --> 20:16.949
you always find
another way down.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.352
I have regrets, like I said...

20:19.386 --> 20:21.321
Wrong choice.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.989
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Remember,

20:23.022 --> 20:25.525
I did say those words
 would come back to haunt Petra.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.495
Now I see you are
the much prettier one.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.698
My other daughter
is an ungrateful bitch.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.499
(scoffs)

20:32.532 --> 20:35.535
No. You don't dare
talk about her.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.005
She's wonderful, kind,
American success story.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.475
Yeah, right. Let me give you
some motherly advice, dear.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.744
Don't expect anything
from her.

20:44.777 --> 20:49.649
Trust me, she's plotting
to get rid of you already.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.918
Because she only
cares about herself.

20:51.951 --> 20:56.489
But, see, you're wrong, Mother.

20:56.523 --> 20:59.692
I care about Anezka, which is
why she'll be staying in Miami.

20:59.726 --> 21:00.760
With me.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.595
And you'll be staying
in prison.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.331
Alone.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.965
Come on, Anezka.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.800
Yes.

21:07.834 --> 21:11.571
Thanking you, beautiful
sister. Thanking you.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.312
Better than the first one?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.486
Okay.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.988
Boobies aside, though...
WOMAN:
You're back!

21:29.021 --> 21:30.490
Where's your mother?

21:30.523 --> 21:31.824
She's not here.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.560
I'm deciding without her.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.027
Oh.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.563
Okay. (laughs)

21:36.596 --> 21:39.499
So is this the one?

21:42.769 --> 21:46.706
I'm still not sure. (laughs)
Yeah, I-I think I just need

21:46.739 --> 21:50.042
one more night
to think about it.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.345
I don't think. I know.
Ma'am,

21:52.379 --> 21:54.581
this woman says
you stole her wallet.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.483
Excuse me?
You were following me

21:56.516 --> 21:58.050
around the pool, next
thing, my wallet's gone.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.086
And I never forget a face!

22:02.955 --> 22:06.693
Did you steal a wallet?
No. I stole three wallets.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.828
Anezka!
How could you do that?

22:08.861 --> 22:11.063
Was easy. I was pickpocket
in Czech Republic.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.566
This is my hotel.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.868
I only wanting
to buy for you present

22:15.902 --> 22:18.137
for thank you.
No, no presents, okay?

22:18.170 --> 22:19.672
No presents, and

22:19.706 --> 22:20.973
no stealing,
you understand?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.075
Yes. Yes.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.544
J.J.:
 Nope.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.145
Don't like it at all.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.549
Well, thanks
for not mincing your words.
It's just not you.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.551
For your wedding, you
have to look like you.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.486
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 She sounds pretty sure
 of herself

22:33.520 --> 22:35.154
for someone who's known Jane
 for all of seven months.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.990
I'm telling you,
the first one.
Yeah, maybe.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.726
Oh, hey, did you get your
letter about next year?

22:39.759 --> 22:42.795
I got mine
this morning.
Letter?

22:42.829 --> 22:45.064
The notification you're
gonna be invited back

22:45.097 --> 22:46.733
to the grad program?
Wait.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.868
I thought that was just,
like, formality.
Yeah.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.037
I just mean that I got the
actual physical letter.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.473
Oh.
I'm sure
yours is coming.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.608
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.910
Wait. So, who decides that?

22:57.944 --> 23:00.480
Like, the dean, or...?
Not the dean.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.782
Don't say it!
Your advisor.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.052
Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

23:11.858 --> 23:15.194
So, again, thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.997
Anyway, I was talking
to a friend of mine

23:18.030 --> 23:20.967
who got a letter about enrolling
in the program next year,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.835
and I haven't gotten mine yet,

23:22.869 --> 23:25.838
so I just wanted to check in,
make sure there was no problem.

23:25.872 --> 23:29.576
No problem. I just haven't
made my decision yet.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.178
Oh. Okay.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.681
You know I wonder

23:34.714 --> 23:36.883
if, well, because
of our differences...

23:36.916 --> 23:38.651
well, that you can't

23:38.685 --> 23:40.052
be objective about me.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.988
You mean because
you verbally assaulted me?

23:42.021 --> 23:45.224
I wouldn't call it that.
Regardless,

23:45.257 --> 23:46.959
I can assure you
I can remain objective.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.661
I can separate you,

23:48.695 --> 23:49.996
Jane, the person...

23:50.029 --> 23:51.498
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Whom she hates.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.032
...from your work.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.534
Which she also hates.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.069
Well... what a relief.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.539
If I like your next rewrite,
you'll get that letter.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.743
Which brings us here.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.812
(gasps)
No! What have you done?!

24:05.845 --> 24:08.548
I'm sorry, but I can't
get kicked out of school,

24:08.581 --> 24:10.216
and that means giving Marlene
a revision

24:10.249 --> 24:13.085
she doesn't hate!
So you're tearing me
away from Robert?

24:13.119 --> 24:15.788
How can I change my feelings
now that you've made me

24:15.822 --> 24:17.690
fall so deeply
in love with him?!

24:17.724 --> 24:20.527
I don't know. I just know
that it has to be less about

24:20.560 --> 24:22.128
romantic love
and-and more about...

24:24.230 --> 24:27.734
...something
I haven't figured out yet.

24:29.569 --> 24:32.238
I don't get it.
Why did we move?
Because

24:32.271 --> 24:34.607
I wasn't feeling the flow in my
office. I need to feel the flow.

24:35.742 --> 24:38.611
Wait. What?! No!

24:38.645 --> 24:39.979
You are making me

24:40.012 --> 24:41.581
a salsa-dancer,
slash-government assassin?!

24:41.614 --> 24:45.685
Jane, I can't!
I hate guns!

24:45.718 --> 24:47.687
No.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.089
No, please don't make me do it.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.992
You know you can't mix genres
like this! (groans)

24:53.025 --> 24:54.727
(sighs)

24:54.761 --> 24:56.128
(sighs)

24:56.162 --> 24:58.965
(groaning)

24:58.998 --> 25:01.033
Jane, that's not
how it works.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.870
You can't just turn me
into a lesbian!

25:03.903 --> 25:07.206
See? Tons of beautiful,

25:07.239 --> 25:10.142
scantily-clad women, and

25:10.176 --> 25:11.878
I feel nothing.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.079
(sighs)

25:14.246 --> 25:18.084
Well, not nothing.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.652
(laughs)

25:26.926 --> 25:28.260
Hey.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.029
Oh, you gonna say
bye to Mommy?

25:30.062 --> 25:32.665
Oh! Have the best day ever
with Daddy, huh?

25:34.233 --> 25:35.735
And you're sure you can
watch him all day?

25:35.768 --> 25:38.037
Because Chepa's unavailable,
so...
Jane.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.271
I'm sure.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.640
Go.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.874
Bye. Let's go.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.342
Let's go, buddy!

25:43.375 --> 25:45.612
What if the house
is a 1950's bomb shelter?

25:45.645 --> 25:46.979
You're a scientist...

25:47.013 --> 25:48.948
No, no, no, boring.
No one cares about science.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.817
Jane, this way.
I've made your grandmother

25:50.850 --> 25:52.885
wonderful wallpaper samples

25:52.919 --> 25:55.655
to help with her
redecorating dilemma.

25:55.688 --> 25:56.923
Oh.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.892
I didn't know...

25:59.926 --> 26:01.794
What's she doing here?
ROGELIO:
Enough is enough!

26:01.828 --> 26:03.596
You two need to talk!

26:03.630 --> 26:05.765
Is this some
kind of ambush?

26:05.798 --> 26:07.199
No, we were just coming
to walk through the set.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.168
Of course it's an ambush.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.637
You shouldn't be fighting
at a time like this.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.941
Because you're not only
mother and daughter,
but you're best friends.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.609
JANE:
See, but that is just it.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.745
I don't want a best
friend all the time.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.212
Sometimes, I want a mom

26:20.246 --> 26:23.683
who is responsible
and practical and...

26:23.716 --> 26:26.052
wouldn't have let me
quit salsa lessons.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.920
Wh...

26:27.954 --> 26:30.089
You-you begged me
to let you quit.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.191
But you shouldn't have let me.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.693
That's what I'm saying.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.061
If you'd made me stick it out,

26:35.094 --> 26:36.896
I'd know how
to dance salsa

26:36.929 --> 26:39.065
and I would have been better
for it in the long run.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.233
Are you serious? You sucked!

26:41.267 --> 26:43.235
You see?

26:43.269 --> 26:44.837
Whatever.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.073
I can't do this.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.745
*

27:01.888 --> 27:03.990
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, right. It's a set.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.391
ROGELIO:
 How hard can it be

27:05.424 --> 27:08.127
to think of a story
 set in a house?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.996
I hate all
of these ideas!

27:10.029 --> 27:11.197
Well, you know what?

27:11.230 --> 27:12.865
Maybe you should
get another writer.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.134
No. No, no, wait, wait!
Wait, I'm sorry.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.403
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have a lot

27:17.436 --> 27:18.771
on my mind.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.006
Okay.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.407
How about...

27:21.440 --> 27:23.876
It's about Jane and
Xiomara, obviously.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.211
I've never seen them like this.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.412
And the timing

27:26.445 --> 27:28.014
couldn't be worse.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.316
Hello, the timing
is the whole point.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.884
What?

27:31.918 --> 27:34.286
Come on.
It's so obvious!

27:34.320 --> 27:36.889
And so,
 Dina explained to Rogelio

27:36.923 --> 27:39.692
what was really going on
 between Jane and Xiomara.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.460
And let's just say...

27:41.493 --> 27:43.162
it rang true.

27:43.195 --> 27:46.165
You are brilliant.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.700
I've said that before,

27:47.734 --> 27:50.369
but I never meant it
until this moment.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.071
And now,

27:52.104 --> 27:55.307
I know how to fix this.
(heavenly choir singing)

28:02.514 --> 28:03.883
Aren't you hungry?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.417
Maybe you should
go get some lunch.

28:05.451 --> 28:08.320
No. No, I don't deserve food.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.823
Anezka, stop.
The wallets are returned,

28:10.857 --> 28:13.092
we apologized,
it's fine. Please.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.261
Go get some lunch,
so I can concentrate.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.131
Oh, and charge it to me.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.332
Don't steal it.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.868
Yes. So sorry again.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.306
(sighs)

28:29.108 --> 28:31.410
Well, hello, there you are!

28:31.443 --> 28:32.912
(laughs)

28:32.945 --> 28:34.046
(shrieks)

28:34.080 --> 28:36.082
BARBARA:
Oh!

28:36.115 --> 28:38.284
Oh!

28:38.317 --> 28:39.786
You...

28:48.027 --> 28:49.929
(urgent knocking)
Jane, hi.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.764
Are you okay?
Is everything okay?
Yes. Yes, yes.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.032
Is there any way
that you can take Mateo?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.834
Now?
It's just kind of
an emergency.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.302
The hotel deal's
falling through

28:56.335 --> 28:58.971
because Petra's sister
attacked the owner...

28:59.005 --> 29:00.339
Wait, what? Petra's sister?

29:00.372 --> 29:01.874
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh. Right.

29:01.908 --> 29:04.176
So now we might
be out of a deal

29:04.210 --> 29:05.511
and I gotta go
beg Barbara...

29:05.544 --> 29:06.979
Well, I've got
a meeting with my advisor

29:07.013 --> 29:08.447
and my grandma's out.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.548
What about your mom?
I saw her by the pool...

29:09.581 --> 29:12.018
No, no, that's not
even an option.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.286
Whatever, I'll just
take him to school and...

29:14.320 --> 29:16.155
J.J.'s supposed to be there,

29:16.188 --> 29:19.025
so hopefully she'll watch him
while I'm in my meeting.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.427
Which brings us here, now.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.863
And while I've come around
to agreeing with your note,

29:23.896 --> 29:26.065
it is a rather big one...

29:26.098 --> 29:28.901
Take the romance
 out of your romance novel.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.437
...and so, in order
to address it fully...

29:31.470 --> 29:33.305
(Mateo crying)

29:33.339 --> 29:34.907
I just think that I need
a little more time.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.076
(crying getting louder)

29:39.345 --> 29:42.448
And if, um...

29:42.481 --> 29:44.550
Oh.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.418
It's just that he's been
screaming nonstop

29:46.452 --> 29:47.820
or calling me "dada."

29:47.854 --> 29:49.321
Oh, it's okay,
it's okay, Mateo.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.923
(smooching sound)

29:50.957 --> 29:53.893
I-I'm sorry. This was...

29:53.926 --> 29:55.194
clearly not
supposed to happen.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.065
It's just, I'm in a really
big fight with my mom.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.233
She usually watches him.
Are you crying?

30:01.267 --> 30:03.235
Jane, no!

30:03.269 --> 30:04.937
This is worse than sex crying!

30:04.971 --> 30:06.472
No. No...

30:06.505 --> 30:08.174
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

30:08.207 --> 30:10.042
I can see the tears!
Okay, fine!

30:10.076 --> 30:11.377
Fine, I'm crying, okay?

30:11.410 --> 30:13.512
But I don't want to be,
so just ignore it!

30:13.545 --> 30:15.214
Okay? The point is, is that

30:15.247 --> 30:16.849
my life is really
overwhelming right now

30:16.883 --> 30:18.617
and I have never
missed a deadline

30:18.650 --> 30:20.219
and I could really
use an extension

30:20.252 --> 30:23.055
so I can put
my best foot forward.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.591
Do you need a minute
to compose yourself?

30:25.624 --> 30:27.226
(crying):
No!

30:27.259 --> 30:28.928
Yes.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.863
Thank you.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.498
Huh.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.366
Will Professor Donaldson
 reveal a hidden soft side?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.068
Will the sight of Jane crying

30:36.102 --> 30:38.070
and the cute baby
 melt her cold heart?

30:38.104 --> 30:39.939
I'm okay. (sniffs)

30:39.972 --> 30:41.407
Thank you.
Good.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.643
So the deadline
is the deadline.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.345
You either meet it

30:46.378 --> 30:48.247
or you don't.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.020
And again, we are so,
so incredibly sorry.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.555
I mean, my sister
clearly has

30:56.588 --> 30:59.125
personal space issues.
ANEZKA:
And I am so ashamed.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.427
And I want to cut off my hand.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.661
PETRA:
What?

31:02.694 --> 31:04.130
I deserve it!
Worse! Worse!

31:04.163 --> 31:06.498
My hands should be
chewed off by wolves!

31:06.532 --> 31:08.935
No...
Yes, everything
is bad,

31:08.968 --> 31:10.202
everything, I hate it,

31:10.236 --> 31:12.104
I hate myself.
BARBARA:
No, now, just stop.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.672
Okay?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.307
I-I'm fine, honestly.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.109
I-I did approach you

31:17.143 --> 31:18.310
rather suddenly.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.511
Really?

31:19.545 --> 31:21.613
Oh, thank you, thank you.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.415
Not deserving it,

31:23.449 --> 31:25.084
but thanking you,
thanking you so much,

31:25.117 --> 31:27.019
so very much...
Anezka, stop.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.055
Um, why don't you go
wait in my office?

31:29.088 --> 31:30.256
Yes, of course.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.024
Thank you, of course.
Thank you.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.259
Thank you.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.033
Again, I am... so sorry.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.969
Apology accepted.

31:45.171 --> 31:47.974
The problem is, I like you
a little bit less now.

31:48.007 --> 31:52.244
Not to mention, another
bid came in higher.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.613
Match this, and
the place is yours.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.548
Sounds... great.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.384
RAFAEL:
We'll be in touch.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.555
Can you meet this?

32:03.589 --> 32:06.458
Depends if he uses
 that insider trading money.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.194
I don't know.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.396
I just hope Anezka
didn't ruin this.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.999
And from one
 fractured family...

32:13.032 --> 32:14.600
to another.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.202
(gasps):
Jane!

32:16.235 --> 32:17.736
You're here.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.338
ROGELIO:
Mwa! Come.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.207
XIOMARA: Wait. What's going on?
Sit.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.708
Dad, is this another ambush?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.576
ROGELIO:
Stop it. Of course not.
I just invited

32:24.610 --> 32:26.478
my family and two
brilliant executives

32:26.512 --> 32:27.546
to watch a run-through

32:27.579 --> 32:29.615
of my favorite

32:29.648 --> 32:31.217
Tiago episode yet.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.352
Sit. Let's begin!

32:35.521 --> 32:37.990
And... action!

32:44.530 --> 32:47.499
That's weird.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.217
(doorbell rings)

33:41.187 --> 33:42.754
What?
That's ridiculous.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.168
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And then, something
 amazing happened.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.837
Rogelio's cockamamie,

34:31.870 --> 34:33.839
totally wackadoo,
 completely crazy plan...

34:33.871 --> 34:36.808
well, it actually
 started to work.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.445
And I would tell you what
 they are feeling right now,

34:39.478 --> 34:40.812
but as we have learned,

34:40.846 --> 34:44.550
it's better to show
 than tell.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.885
DIRECTOR:
Cut!

34:46.918 --> 34:50.789
Okay, so there had better be
a huge Tiago twist coming up.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.824
To be clear,
 there was no twist.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.161
Here's the twist.

34:55.194 --> 34:58.264
See, it's a family of clones

34:58.297 --> 35:00.866
posing as a regular family
with regular problems.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.368
And Tiago

35:02.401 --> 35:04.470
is gaining their trust,

35:04.503 --> 35:07.639
so he can stop them from
taking over the planet.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.141
BOTH:
Ah...

35:09.175 --> 35:11.377
See, now that
makes more sense.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.878
I mean, who cares
about a fight

35:12.911 --> 35:14.480
between a mom and
a daughter, right?

35:14.513 --> 35:16.915
(crying):
I'm so sorry, Mom.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.384
(shushes)

35:18.417 --> 35:19.785
(crying):
I know.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.520
Me, too.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.555
SALSA SOFIA:
What about me?

35:23.589 --> 35:25.691
What was my mother like?

35:25.724 --> 35:27.493
What is it?

35:27.526 --> 35:28.827
I have an idea

35:28.860 --> 35:29.895
for my novel.

35:29.928 --> 35:30.929
Okay.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.364
Go, go write!

35:32.398 --> 35:33.699
I'll pick up Mateo.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.801
Oh...

35:37.836 --> 35:39.271
So, I'm gonna
ask Anezka to leave.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.506
I should've never let her

35:40.539 --> 35:41.940
stay in the first place.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.442
She messed up your deal!

35:43.475 --> 35:45.544
Hey, come on.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.845
Come on, what?

35:46.878 --> 35:48.547
This hotel,
the longevity of it,

35:48.580 --> 35:50.916
well, I...

35:50.949 --> 35:54.386
might not be the greatest mother
in the regular ways...

35:54.420 --> 35:57.689
but now I've gotten in the way
of us providing for them.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.391
You haven't.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.727
You didn't.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.462
My sister, okay?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.597
Same thing.

36:05.631 --> 36:08.467
And maybe it was Petra

36:08.500 --> 36:11.203
feeling so badly,
 or the fact that he, too,

36:11.237 --> 36:13.605
was feeling like
 a crap parent in that moment,

36:13.639 --> 36:15.407
but Rafael just...

36:15.441 --> 36:17.276
well, he wanted to be the hero.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.278
I found the money to buy it.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.680
In any case,
 he used the dirty money.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.682
And yes...

36:23.715 --> 36:25.517
he would come to regret it.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.253
But that's for the future.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.954
I, I talked to the bank.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.657
They extended the loan.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.292
It's an investment
for our future.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.427
Wait, so Anezka
didn't ruin things?

36:35.461 --> 36:36.428
No.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.896
She didn't.

36:37.929 --> 36:40.599
And listen, maybe
don't be so hard on her.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.235
You know,
she's had a tough life.

36:43.269 --> 36:44.603
And I felt for her.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.605
You know, with Barbara.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.507
Yeah.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.942
I did, too.

36:50.976 --> 36:54.246
So... maybe keep her around

36:54.280 --> 36:56.948
just a little longer?

36:56.982 --> 36:58.917
PETRA:
Yeah, okay.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.652
Maybe just
a little bit longer.

37:00.686 --> 37:04.490
Well, this promises
 to be awkward.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.826
*

37:28.447 --> 37:30.449
(gasps)

37:39.391 --> 37:41.727
*

37:53.605 --> 37:56.542
Will you marry me?

37:56.575 --> 37:57.843
Yes! Yes!

37:57.876 --> 37:59.978
(applause)

38:06.818 --> 38:08.587
(both laugh)

38:08.620 --> 38:10.055
ROBERT:
Thank you.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.509
(laughs)

38:33.812 --> 38:36.348
Finished.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.883
And sent. And...

38:37.916 --> 38:40.085
I think I deserve a nine-dollar
beer from the mini-fridge.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.921
Make it two.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.023
Thank you.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.758
Mm-hmm.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.093
Mmm.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.528
Whoa, oh.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.430
(sighs)

38:51.463 --> 38:53.399
You okay?

38:54.466 --> 38:55.867
Actually wanted to talk
to you about something.

38:55.901 --> 38:56.902
Mm-hmm?

38:56.935 --> 38:58.604
About my place with Mateo.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.506
Well... don't worry,
Rafael's just gonna have

39:00.539 --> 39:02.441
to be comfortable with it.
No.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.510
Actually wanted to talk about
what you're comfortable with.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.546
Because we've actually
never talked about that.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.448
Yeah, y-you're right.

39:09.481 --> 39:10.849
That's true.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.618
Yeah, and it's just
little things, you know?

39:12.651 --> 39:14.920
Like... you didn't
ask me to watch him.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.488
And you kept saying

39:16.522 --> 39:18.524
that I was babysitting.
Oh...

39:18.557 --> 39:20.659
well, I, but I didn't
mean it like that.
I know.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.628
It's just...

39:22.661 --> 39:25.397
I want to be more than that.

39:25.431 --> 39:26.732
You are.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.935
And I'm really glad
you want to be.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.539
(chuckles)
And you're right.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.641
We have to figure it out.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.444
Step one?

39:38.477 --> 39:39.878
Uh-huh.

39:39.911 --> 39:43.515
You're getting your own color
in my calendar.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.685
Yeah, that's not as sexy to me
as it is to you.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.654
Really?
Yeah.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.088
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of sexy...

39:50.121 --> 39:52.123
Dina, what a success that was!

39:52.157 --> 39:54.660
The execs loved....
Whoa!

39:54.693 --> 39:56.828
Is that what you
really look like?

39:58.029 --> 40:00.699
No, it's just
that you are a writer,

40:00.732 --> 40:03.502
and writers, they don't
care about these things,

40:03.535 --> 40:05.170
but that color looks

40:05.203 --> 40:07.639
very attractive on you.

40:07.673 --> 40:08.974
I'm going out to dinner.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.576
Got it.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.810
Well, thank you.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.612
You really saved the day.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.946
That whole clone thing?

40:14.980 --> 40:17.215
Doubles are like
telenovela 101.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.684
No.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.552
I mean with my family.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.120
What?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.855
Nothing, it's just...

40:23.889 --> 40:27.225
The way you care
about your family.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.662
That's a very attractive
color on you, too.

40:30.696 --> 40:33.565
Well, I love them very much.

40:33.599 --> 40:34.900
I can tell.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.503
And like I said,

40:37.536 --> 40:40.572
it's a very attractive quality.

40:40.606 --> 40:43.609
Well, you also look
very attractive.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.711
You said that already.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.913
I meant it already.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.750
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, my.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.753
(door opens)

40:54.786 --> 40:56.688
Ready for dress number three?

40:56.722 --> 40:59.224
Yes, yes, ready.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.461
(sighs)

41:05.063 --> 41:07.833
(crying):
That's definitely the dress.

41:07.866 --> 41:10.268
Ah, but that's
 for another day.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.970
A wedding day.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.205
(laughs)

41:14.239 --> 41:15.941
Which brings us here now.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.576
(phone chimes)
Oh.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.110
(gasps)
It's Marlene.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.612
Deep breaths, Jane.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.648
Deep breaths.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.717
What does it say?

41:25.751 --> 41:27.018
Jane, what does it say?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.957
I'm back in the program.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.559
(laughs)
Yes!

41:33.592 --> 41:34.826
Yes!

41:34.860 --> 41:37.028
Ooh, yes!
(grunting)

41:37.062 --> 41:38.864
Well, you know what they say.

41:38.897 --> 41:39.965
Those who can't salsa dance,

41:39.998 --> 41:41.833
write about salsa dancers.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.001
I'm so proud of you.
Oh, thank you!

41:43.034 --> 41:45.036
(chuckles)
Ah... yes!

41:46.337 --> 41:49.240
(camera shutter clicking)

41:49.274 --> 41:51.610
Yeah, uh-oh!

41:51.643 --> 41:53.845
Well, what can I say?

41:53.879 --> 41:56.114
We're not all about
 the marriage plot, right?
