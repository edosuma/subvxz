OH, MAN!

30:24.924 --> 30:29.862
I AM GOING, YET AGAIN,
TO MISS MY WIFE'S BIRTHDAY.

30:29.896 --> 30:33.499
- WHAT DID YOU GET HER?
- OH, MAN.
I'M GONNA MISS HER BIRTHDAY.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.834
STUCK WITH A BUNCH OF FROGGIES.
[ Grey ]
YEAH, YEAH.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.504
YOU SHOULD'VE STAYED IN SCHOOL
AND GOT YOUR DOCTORATE
IN NUCLEAR PHYSICS.

30:38.537 --> 30:42.841
STUCK WITH A BUNCH OF FROGGIES.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THAT'S GREAT.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.378
COLONEL.
NOT NOW.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.915
NO. COLONEL--
NO, I CAN'T SEE YOU NOW.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.183
IF I COULD HAVE ONE MOMENT--
JUST ONE MOMENT.

30:51.217 --> 30:54.853
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE PROBABLY
ON YOUR WAY TO VISIT THE GALLANT
AMERICAN OBSERVER...

30:54.887 --> 30:58.024
WHO WAS ACCIDENTALLY WOUNDED
IN YOUR TRIUMPHAL ASSAULT,
BUT--

30:58.057 --> 31:00.359
YES, I'M SORRY
YOUR MAN WAS HURT.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.929
OUR MAN WAS SHOT, YES.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.965
YES, I'M MOST SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.
PLEASE COME IN.

31:08.067 --> 31:11.037
SO, WHAT, UH, WAS IT
YOU WANTED TO SAY?

31:11.070 --> 31:13.572
I WOULD LIKE MEDEVAC
TRANSPORT FOR HIM TODAY.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.275
WELL, I'M SURE YOUR PEOPLE--
ON U.N. AIRCRAFT
IMMEDIATELY.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.577
TO LANDSTUHL-RHINEMANN
AIR BASE.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.213
WELL, UNDER THE CHARTER,
YOUR ARMED FORCES
ARE RESPONSIBLE...

31:21.247 --> 31:24.216
FOR MEDEVAC TO YOUR BASES
FROM THE U.N. CONTROL.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.219
INDEED THEY ARE.
AND THEY'VE ASSURED ME
THEY WILL PROVIDE SAME...

31:27.253 --> 31:31.057
1600 NEXT TUESDAY.
THEN?

31:31.090 --> 31:34.626
WE'D KIND OF LIKE
TO GO HOME NOW, SIR.

31:34.660 --> 31:38.864
ON YOUR U.N. GULFSTREAM.
THAT IS, IF YOU CAN
SPARE THE PLANE.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.301
AND, UH, IF I COULD NOT?

31:42.334 --> 31:46.772
SIR, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING...

31:46.805 --> 31:49.908
THAT I WOULD DISSEMINATE
A COPY OF THIS VIDEO...

31:49.942 --> 31:54.280
SHOWING YOUR UNILATERAL
AND UNWARRANTED AND BOTCHED
ASSAULT ON THE COMPOUND,

31:54.313 --> 31:59.051
AND THE RESULTING
AND UNNECESSARY LOSS OF LIFE
AND INJURY TO MY TEAMMATE...

31:59.085 --> 32:03.322
IN RETALIATION
FOR YOUR FAILURE TO GIVE ME
YOUR AIRCRAFT.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.258
STAND AT ATTENTION
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
TO ME, SOLDIER.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.628
I AIN'T YOUR SOLDIER.

32:09.661 --> 32:12.431
AND I AIN'T
IN YOUR CHAIN OF COMMAND,
AND I AIN'T IN YOUR ARMY.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.600
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

32:14.633 --> 32:17.236
YOU'RE ABOUT
ONE HALF SECOND AWAY FROM
A REAL BAD STATE OF HEALTH.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.172
AND IF YOU WANT TO TRY
THAT CASE RIGHT NOW,
GO AHEAD.

32:20.206 --> 32:23.675
AND THAT WOULD BE
WORTH YOUR CAREER?

32:23.709 --> 32:26.178
YOU BET YOUR FRENCH ASS.

32:33.485 --> 32:37.589
[ Molly ] AGAINST
TWO PERCENT OF ALL INCOME.
DON'T YOU NEED TO GET DRESSED?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.258
I AM DRESSED.
UH-HUH.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.261
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
TWO PERCENT OF INCOME.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.131
TWO PERCENT OF ALL
BLACKTHORNE INCOME.

32:45.164 --> 32:48.534
ALL BLACKTHORNE INCOME--
NOT JUST THE MIDDLE EAST.

32:48.567 --> 32:52.138
I UNDERSTAND.
WHICH MEANS NO MORE
JUMPING OUT OF AIRPLANES.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.972
HOW'S MACK DOING?
IS HE COMING TONIGHT?

32:54.006 --> 32:56.008
WHERE'S MY TIE?
IN FIVE YEARS,

32:56.042 --> 32:58.210
WE'LL BE EQUITY OWNERS.

32:58.244 --> 33:02.248
- WHERE'S MY TIE?

IT'S IN THE HALLWAY.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.561
MY PURPLE HEART.
YOU KNOW WHERE MY--

33:15.594 --> 33:17.563
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSING?

33:17.596 --> 33:19.398
WHY SHOULD I?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.935
WHAT'S WRONG, BABY?

33:27.773 --> 33:30.542
YOU RE-UPPED.
HONEY, I HAVE NOT RE-UPPED.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.879
DID YOU READ THIS
ALL THE WAY THROUGH?

33:35.181 --> 33:37.349
"NOTIFICATION

33:45.724 --> 33:47.993
BUT I HAVE LISTENED.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.196
I HAVEN'T RE-UPPED.

33:50.229 --> 33:54.666
AND I AM, AS PER YOUR WISHES,
LEAVING THIS UNIT.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.337
THAT'S WHY I'M LEAVING
THE UNIT, TIFF.
I'M KEEPING MY PROMISE.

33:58.370 --> 34:03.008
WE'LL LIVE A NORMAL LIFE--
ALL OF US.

34:03.041 --> 34:07.446

35:26.057 --> 35:28.260
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE
YOUR LIFE, I THINK,
A LITTLE SIMPLER.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.462
NO, I DON'T THINK
I'M INTERESTED.

35:32.664 --> 35:36.535
BARTENDER, WHATEVER YOU GOT
YOUR HAND ON, START POURING.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHEN TO STOP.

35:36.568 --> 35:41.106
[ Laughs ]
HE SAYS, "IT'S A RECIPE
FOR DISASTER."

35:41.139 --> 35:44.643
SO I SAY, "HONEY,
IT'S NOT A RECIPE.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.645
IT'S A WHOLE COOKBOOK."

35:46.678 --> 35:49.281
[ Laughing ]

35:49.315 --> 35:51.217

36:13.272 --> 36:16.975
THE FRENCH, WE NOTE,

36:17.008 --> 36:19.645
THEY'D HAVE LOST
WORLD WAR I AND II...

36:19.678 --> 36:22.748
- IF IT WASN'T FOR OUR HELP.
- [ Men ] HOO-RAH!

36:22.781 --> 36:25.083

WE ALL HAVE SECRETS.

37:33.652 --> 37:38.290
MOST SECRETS
ARE NOT SHAMEFUL.
THEY'RE JUST PRIVATE.

37:38.324 --> 37:41.259
THE SECRETS OF MARRIAGE
ARE PRIVATE.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.895
THE SECRETS OF COMBAT
ARE PRIVATE.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.565
WE WOMEN CAN'T KNOW THEM.
