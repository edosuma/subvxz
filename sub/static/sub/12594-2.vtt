00:02.530 --> 00:05.090
- Previously on Private Eyes...
- Any thought about returning
to pro hockey, you killed it.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.269
- Did you ever track down that
manager who cleaned you out?

00:07.300 --> 00:10.667
- I got in!
- You got in! I'm never gonna be
able to pay for all this.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.235
- I'm Angie Everett,
the PI your dad hired.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.147
- Matt Shade.
- Wow, Matt Shade,

00:16.180 --> 00:18.671
that's a PI name
ifI ever heard one.

00:18.710 --> 00:22.316
So, same time tomorrow?
- We're done.
- Yeah, we're not done.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.818
- Seriously, what are you
gonna do for a job?

00:24.850 --> 00:27.250
- No.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.258
- Definitely not.

00:29.290 --> 00:32.123
***

00:36.430 --> 00:38.625
- Ten shirts, five skirts,
two blazers,

00:38.670 --> 00:42.060
some gym stuff... anything
we're missing? Besides a Sherpa.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.431
- It's so stupid how
they make you wear a uniform.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.700
- Hey, I wore a uniform
for ten years in the League.

00:46.740 --> 00:49.277
Uniforms are good.
Means you're part of something.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.642
- C'mon, Dad, I wasn't
even their first choice.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.172
- So you classed up the waiting
list until they figured out
how fabulous you are.

00:55.220 --> 00:59.611
No big deal. Ellard's luclq
to have you, honey.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.622
- The private detective woman,
Angie. You need to call her.

01:06.660 --> 01:09.197
Tell her you liked working
with her and ask her for a job.

01:09.230 --> 01:12.131
She should ask me!
I basically solved the case.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.491
- Yeah, you're
basically not a PI.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.861
Is there
somewhere else we have to go?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.834
- There's one more place.
Come on.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.678
***

01:27.920 --> 01:31.708
- It's nice.
- Dad!

01:31.750 --> 01:34.389
Over here.

01:36.890 --> 01:39.324
See? Braille tattoos.
They Implant steel balls

01:39.360 --> 01:41.521
under the skin so that
they can be read by touch.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.664
Aren't they so cool?

01:43.700 --> 01:46.533
- So cool.
- And you can get
any message you want.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.868
I want mine to say
"Kick-ass Bitch".

01:50.910 --> 01:53.902
- We can decide the message
later. But what do you think?

01:53.940 --> 01:56.841
- Have you talked
to your mother about this?

01:56.880 --> 01:59.314
- Yeah right. You wanna give her
a nervous breakdown in the
middle of her trip?

01:59.350 --> 02:01.648
Besides, she's not in charge
anymore, you are.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.217
- Right.
- Please, please, Dad.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.389
I really want this.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.820
This is Matt Shade.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.658
Oh, hey Robyn, long time.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.794
Whoa, whoa, slow down. What?

02:19.840 --> 02:23.469
- Hello,

02:23.510 --> 02:25.569
this is your wake-up call,
Detective Mazhari.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.771
]
- I've tried that before, Angie,

02:27.810 --> 02:29.778
but you keep shooting me down.

02:29.810 --> 02:33.348
- Slow your roll. I'm talking
about cases.
- Hey!

02:33.380 --> 02:35.917
Parolee gone rogue?

02:35.950 --> 02:39.454
- If I had something, you know
I would. I'm sorry, Angie.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.958
Thanks.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.787
- Hey!
- Dammit!

02:43.830 --> 02:46.298
- Get in.
Why would I?

02:46.330 --> 02:48.298
- Get in! I'll explain
on the way.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.867
- Slow down, Richard Gere.
You can't afford me.
- Angle.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.539
Please. Get in.

02:59.940 --> 03:03.842
Robyn?
- In here.

03:13.290 --> 03:16.225
I need help.

03:18.730 --> 03:22.860
- ** I see you and you see me

03:22.900 --> 03:26.666
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

03:26.700 --> 03:29.863
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:29.910 --> 03:31.969
* What my head overlooks

03:32.010 --> 03:35.832
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:35.880 --> 03:38.644
* When it's watching for lies

03:38.680 --> 03:40.978
* 'Cause you can't escape my

03:41.020 --> 03:42.647
* Private Eyes

03:42.690 --> 03:44.544
* They're watching you

03:44.590 --> 03:47.718
* Private Eyes

03:47.760 --> 03:49.751
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

03:49.790 --> 03:52.224
* Watching you *

03:58.570 --> 04:01.630
- Whoa, hey,
what are you doing?

04:01.670 --> 04:04.639
- I'm calling the cops.
- We don't even know
what the situation is.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.639
- I think I've got the headline.
Dead guy. Guilt-stricken hottie.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.308
- I didn't do this.
This is how I found him.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.318
- You should have no problem
explaining that to the police.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.318
- You don't understand.
Zack IS my busnness partner.

04:14.350 --> 04:17.012
I was here last night.
We had a fight.

04:17.050 --> 04:19.450
- All things that don't
scream "I'm innocent."

04:19.490 --> 04:21.913
- Robyn's an old friend.
Just hear her out.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.781
- You've got 60 seconds to
convince me not to call them.

04:24.830 --> 04:28.493
- I met Zack six months ago.
He's a chef, he owns Pravda.

04:28.530 --> 04:31.499
- It's the hottest
restaurant on Front_Street.
- He was struggling wrth debts,

04:31.530 --> 04:33.498
and he needed help.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.792
I fell in love with his brand
and I decided to invest.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.933
- Bad boy chef.

04:37.970 --> 04:41.337
Total rock star.
- He has a reputation--

04:41.380 --> 04:43.803
had... a reputation

04:43.850 --> 04:46.410
for partying and
drinking, drugs.

04:46.450 --> 04:49.419
He played by his own rules.

04:49.450 --> 04:51.782
- I came by to discuss
our sales numbers.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.084
We ate and had some wine,

04:54.120 --> 04:58.523
and Za_ck told me that he wanted
to dissolve our partnership.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.757
I freaked out. I told him that
I'd spent the last six months

05:01.800 --> 05:03.995
and my savings working for this.

05:04.030 --> 05:05.998
It didn't matter,
he'd made up his mind.

05:06.030 --> 05:07.861
So I left.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.903
I came back this morning
and I found him

05:10.940 --> 05:12.669
like this.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.803
I swear
I didn't do this.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.104
You have to believe me.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.018
- I think that we might

05:21.050 --> 05:22.517
get arrested because
this is a murder scene.

05:22.550 --> 05:26.554
- No, Robyn and I go way back.
- That doesn't bode well
for her judgment.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.649
- Come on. Isn't that why you
got into this

05:28.690 --> 05:31.818
- OK. How's this for help:
she should hire a lawyer

05:31.860 --> 05:35.023
and turn herself in.
- Like the police are gonna
believe a word that she says!

05:35.060 --> 05:38.029
Her fingerprints are all over
this place. I'm sure somebody
heard them fighting.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.890
- Just until his lungs
were punctured

05:39.940 --> 05:42.431
by the stabbing
motion of her arm.

05:42.470 --> 05:46.736
Why is there no blood on her?
- I can't explain these things.
I don't care.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.648
- Fine. You don't wanna take it
on, I'll get somebody else.
- Excellent. See ya.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.615
- I thought you were made
of stronger stuff.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.141
Daughter of a cop...
- I see what you did there.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.911
- I'll let you get back to the
really important work of chasing
down fat guys in neck braces.

06:02.490 --> 06:05.880
- OK. What's your
connection to her?

06:05.930 --> 06:09.661
- Her husband Russ and I used
to play hockey together
back in the day.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.635
- Let me guess. He hit the big
time and dumped his wife?
- He died.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.797
About a year ago.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.138
Robyn's just getting
her life back together.

06:17.170 --> 06:20.503
Angie, if we don't help her,
she's got nobody.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.517
- Get her out of here.
I'll wait for the cops.

06:26.550 --> 06:29.041
- You won't regret it.
- I already do.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.824
- I'm sorry I got you
into this, Shade.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.919
- Don't worry, we'll figure
this out. Angie's the best.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.099
- When did you get
into the PI business?

06:41.130 --> 06:43.928
- Uh, it's still kinda new.

07:16.630 --> 07:19.690
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- Detective Nolan.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.866
- Alright, let's have it.
- I was doing some work for him.
I came to check in,

07:23.910 --> 07:26.538
found him on the floor,
called you guys.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.536
- Grab a subpoena, I'd be happy

07:28.580 --> 07:31.048
to tell you.
- I'm serious, Ang.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.947
See anybody leaving? Any sign
of the murder weapon? Anything
at all that could help us?

07:33.980 --> 07:36.687
- Hold on.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.486
I don't know what you're up to,
but if I find out you're
holding out on me?

07:40.520 --> 07:44.149
I'm not gonna be so
accommodating this time around.
You stay out of this.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.536
Yeah, I'm gonna need a Forensics
team out here right away.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.908
- Just get us out of here.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.942
- Oh my god.

08:02.980 --> 08:05.744
I totally forgot.
You killed someone else?

08:05.780 --> 08:07.213
- My car!

08:07.250 --> 08:09.889
I was drinking last night,
and Zack took my keys.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.013
- Better and better.

08:12.050 --> 08:14.553
- Hey Tony, it's Shade.

08:14.590 --> 08:17.889
No, there's nothing wrong
with the Porsche.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.956
Look, I need a favour. Fast.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.662
- Sir. We found these.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.089
They don't match any
of the victim's cars.

08:36.910 --> 08:40.311
- Hey!

08:40.350 --> 08:43.547
Hey, wait! Stop! Stop!

08:45.050 --> 08:48.986
- Thanks, Tony. I owe you one.

08:49.020 --> 08:51.818
No, really, the Porsche is fine.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.828
- Tow truck
on speed dial, huh?

08:53.860 --> 08:55.851
- This car is a classic.
Over thirty years old

08:55.900 --> 08:58.767
and still purrs like a kitten.
You oughta know something
about that.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.043
- You'll be safe here until
we figure out what's gomg on.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.039
- Shade, I can't do this to you.
What about Jules and Don?

09:16.080 --> 09:19.049
- Don knows. And I told Jules
your place IS being painted.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.149
- Let's talk about Zack.
What can you tell us?

09:21.190 --> 09:25.058
Did he have any enemies?

09:25.090 --> 09:27.092
Zack was rough on everybody.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.325
Vendors, staff, customers.

09:31.100 --> 09:34.592
- One of Zack's employees
shot a video last month

09:34.640 --> 09:36.858
and posted it
on the internet.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.732
- [How many times do I have to
say it

09:40.780 --> 09:43.647
[Do you understand anything
that I tell you
- OK.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.046
Who's that guy?
- Miguel Quintana,

09:46.080 --> 09:48.969
the sous-chef. But that's
not who I'm thinking of.

09:49.020 --> 09:52.342
- Helen Jeong.

09:55.090 --> 09:59.083
- She owns Bechamel.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.758
Do you ever go out?
- It's a French bistro down
the street from Zack's place.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.065
- Best lobster bisque
in the city.
- I'm betting Helen

10:05.100 --> 10:06.988
was pretty upset when Zack
moved into the area

10:07.040 --> 10:10.203
and started
stealing her customers.
- Zack didn't help matters.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.971
He dumped garbage on her patio,
he smeared kitchen grease
all over her doors.

10:14.010 --> 10:17.138
- That's disgusting.
To a chef,
that's like foreplay.

10:17.180 --> 10:20.775
- Yeah.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.981
- I'll look into things

10:23.020 --> 10:25.045
and get back to you.
- Wait, I thought...

10:25.090 --> 10:27.752
- I thought we could work it
together like we did last time.

10:27.790 --> 10:30.054
- Together. You and me.

10:30.090 --> 10:33.321
- So, so many reasons, but I'll
choose one: you're not a PI.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.920
- What do you know about
the restaurant industry?

10:35.960 --> 10:38.827
- I know enough.
- Really. What's the hierarchy
of the kitchen?

10:38.870 --> 10:41.395
Who runs front of house? What
day is the fish market open?

10:41.440 --> 10:44.409
- Alright. 200 bucks.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.876
- You want me to pay you
to let me tag along?
- Take it or leave it.

10:47.910 --> 10:50.947
- Fine.

10:50.980 --> 10:54.211
All I got is $160.
- Close enough.
- I get that back if I help you

10:54.250 --> 10:57.947
solve the case.
- I'm not worried.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.128
- Alright, that
right over there,

11:09.160 --> 11:11.697
that's Zack's place, Pravda.
Ultra-hip, cutting-edge fusion

11:11.730 --> 11:14.938
with a Russian flair.
And that is Bechamel.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.461
Classic French,
four Avignon Stars.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.469
- And a chef with a knife
fetish. I say we start there.
- Alright.

11:21.510 --> 11:24.343
- Tomorrow's no good.
We need that delivery by 5PM.

11:24.380 --> 11:27.213
Angie Everett,

11:27.250 --> 11:30.219
Everett Investigations.
- Matt Shade, likewise.

11:30.250 --> 11:33.219
- Wondering if I could ask you a
few questions about Zack Beach.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.216
Accused me

11:35.260 --> 11:38.081
of putting goldfish
in my bouillabaisse?
- He's dead.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.918
- Helen...

11:41.960 --> 11:45.225
- Um, get me some water.

11:45.270 --> 11:48.159
How did it happen?
- He was stabbed

11:48.200 --> 11:51.260
in his apartment.
- How awful.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.006
- It must have been_hard on
your busmess, operating across

11:54.040 --> 11:56.770
from one of the hottest
restaurants In town.
- At first.

11:56.810 --> 11:59.244
But we got by. Besides,

11:59.280 --> 12:03.182
he manages his bookings
so poorly we get walk-ins
who are tired of waiting.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.939
The kitchen grease?

12:05.990 --> 12:08.311
- That's just Zack being Zack.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.158
- And the incident
in his kitchen?
- You remember:

12:11.190 --> 12:13.226
You wielding a knife, looking
like you wanted to kill him.
- Shade!

12:13.260 --> 12:16.969
- Tell them.
Tell them what he did.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.094
Zack stole He_len's
Signature dish,

12:21.140 --> 12:23.529
a traditional cassoulet.

12:23.570 --> 12:26.368
Flash froze it, then deep fried
it in tempura and jammed it

12:26.410 --> 12:30.039
on a skewer.
- Sounds delicious.
- It was disgusting.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.948
How would you feel
if somebody made a mockery
of your life's work?

12:33.980 --> 12:35.948
- Read my Twitter feed.
Difference is I don't go

12:35.980 --> 12:37.948
after people
with kitchen knives.
- I lost my temper!

12:37.990 --> 12:40.083
But I never would've
actually done anything.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.985
- Then where you were
last night?
- Shade!

12:42.020 --> 12:44.159
- Meeting with my financial
advisor, not that it's any

12:44.190 --> 12:48.126
of your business.
Now why don't you just
sleuth your way out of here?

12:49.500 --> 12:50.990
- Let's go.

12:54.900 --> 12:58.028
What the hell was_ that?
You were dancmg
around the question.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.301
- 'Cause that's the point!
Build their trust so you can
catch them in a lie later.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.104
- Excuse me. Sorry about that.

13:04.150 --> 13:07.074
_ Helen can be a bit
high-strung sometimes.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.146
- She might have
had a reason to be.
- But she didn't do it.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.385
- I don't know,

13:12.420 --> 13:14.456
but you should talk
to Zack's staff.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.958
- We heard he was tough on them.
- It's not just that.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.584
Zack was a bit of a player.

13:19.630 --> 13:23.168
He'd hook up with a new waitress
every weekend, and then
dump her by Monday.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.931
If she didn't like it,
he'd fire her. Guy like that,

13:26.970 --> 13:29.438
I'm guessing
he made some enemies.

13:29.470 --> 13:31.438
- Worth checking out.

13:31.470 --> 13:33.529
- Uh-oh.

13:36.010 --> 13:37.978
- Wow! If you
wanna search me,

13:38.010 --> 13:40.069
I'll give you directions.
- Look.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.145
- Detective Derek Nolan.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.148
He already warned me about
interfering in the case.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.215
- You need to take me to dinner.

13:55.900 --> 13:59.028
***

13:59.070 --> 14:01.994
- Down in a sec.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.031
- We're all set for tonight.

14:04.070 --> 14:06.868
The restaurant's doing
a special invite-only seating

14:06.910 --> 14:08.878
in honor of Zack's memory,

14:08.910 --> 14:11.299
but I pulled a few strings.
- By "pulled a few strings",

14:11.350 --> 14:13.318
you mean "talked to Robyn"?
- That's a string!

14:13.350 --> 14:15.318
Did you check Helen's alibi?

14:15.350 --> 14:17.887
- I contacted
her financial advisor.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.649
She confirmed
that Helen was there

14:19.690 --> 14:21.658
until after midnight.
After that,

14:21.690 --> 14:24.124
she took a cab straight home.
I just got off the phone

14:24.160 --> 14:26.151
with the cab company.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.158
What?
- Wow.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.499
What have you done with Angie?
- Eyes up here. You're drooling
on my floor.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.498
- And just like that,
she's back.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.634
After you.

14:36.670 --> 14:39.400
- Yeah.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.898
***

14:56.460 --> 15:00.248
- Look at this place.
All these people are here
for overpriced food?

15:00.300 --> 15:03.519
- And to honor
the passing of a legend.
- Oh, give me a break.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.697
You shove it in one end,
it comes out of the other.

15:05.730 --> 15:08.392
- You haven't even
tasted his cooking!
- I'd take a burger and fries

15:08.440 --> 15:11.034
over this any day.
- And what about
trying something new?

15:11.070 --> 15:14.403
Variety is the spice of life.
- Ketchup is the spice of life.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.045
- No, it isn't.
- OK, I'll be right back.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.277
- No, I can't just sit
at an empty table. We have
to order something. Sit down.

15:27.220 --> 15:30.087
What's the matter
- "Rambutan iberico

15:30.130 --> 15:33.054
with hyssop and demerara."
Is this even English?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.557
- Allow me.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.161
Hi. We'll start with
the black truffle emulsion,

15:39.200 --> 15:41.361
then you can
bring us two orders

15:41.400 --> 15:44.699
of the otoro with cedar smoke,
and bring us your best bottle
of falanghina.

15:44.740 --> 15:47.231
Thank you.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.100
I used to eat out a lot
when I was a player.

15:49.140 --> 15:52.303
- You gonna stick
with that story?

15:52.350 --> 15:54.318
I know about the restaurant
you used to own.

15:54.350 --> 15:56.341
Your ex-manager
got you into it.

15:56.380 --> 16:00.111
You lost half a million bucks
and gained forty pounds.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.185
At least that's what
it looked like in the pictures.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.154
- You backgrounded me.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.421
- I'm a PI, that's what I do.
- Which means

16:07.460 --> 16:09.451
you're considering me
as a partner.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.627
- No. No, I was just--
- Stay here.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.161
- It's not gonna work.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.636
- Your plan to go undercover
as a waitress. You're wearing

16:17.670 --> 16:20.173
the exact same dress as all
the other waitresses. Except...

16:20.210 --> 16:23.008
they're all blonde
-one of Zack's quirks-

16:23.050 --> 16:24.745
so I'm gonna assume
you brought a wig, which is why

16:24.780 --> 16:26.748
you're carrying that large
handbag instead of a clutch.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.146
How am I doing?

16:29.180 --> 16:31.683
- Restaurants are tight.
The staff will pick you out
in a heartbeat.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.018
- They hired new people
for tonight, and I don't have

16:34.060 --> 16:35.789
to convince the whole staff,
just Lindsay.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.425
- Lindsay is the waitress
who posted the video

16:38.460 --> 16:41.020
of Zack and Helen.
I did some digging.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.722
- Have you ever waited tables
before? It's a lot harder

16:43.770 --> 16:46.489
than you think.
- I don't have to pass
an employee evaluation, Shade,

16:46.530 --> 16:48.395
I just have to fake it
until I get some info.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.261
- I can help you
get information.
- I don't need your help.

16:51.310 --> 16:55.098
What I need is for you
to sit here for 15 minutes
and not screw everything up.

16:55.140 --> 16:58.246
Think you can handle that? Good.

17:02.780 --> 17:04.748
Hi. Lindsay?

17:04.790 --> 17:07.714
Lindsay?

17:07.760 --> 17:10.320
- I'm Mimi.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.658
I just got hired for tonight.
The hostess said you could
show me around.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.821
- Whatever.
Just don't slow me down.

17:16.860 --> 17:19.465
Tips are gonna be epic.

17:25.870 --> 17:29.476
I'm only asking because--

17:29.510 --> 17:32.149
- I've got a boyfriend.

17:32.180 --> 17:34.410
- Right.

17:34.450 --> 17:37.089
- Oh my God. Matt Shade.
What a coincidence.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.247
- I'm Detective Derek Nolan.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.258
I'm a big fan.
I've seen everything
you've done. Everything.

17:41.290 --> 17:44.179
I was just watching you today!

17:44.230 --> 17:47.825
- Yeah, you were in this street
cam footage and you were driving
away from my crime scene

17:47.860 --> 17:50.192
this morning. Yeah.

17:50.230 --> 17:51.595
Nice Porsche.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.142
- Ten's up!
- That's unbelievable.

18:04.180 --> 18:07.445
So what did Zack say?
- Zack told Trina he wanted
to go away with her,

18:09.550 --> 18:11.484
with a stripper
he met on Gerrard.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.250
- What an ass!
- I can't believe he's gone.

18:14.290 --> 18:16.451
- You don't think
someone here...?

18:16.490 --> 18:20.119
No. Zack
was a total jerk, but
we knew that going in.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.368
And besides, his attitude
was a lot better lately.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.237
- Last few months, a red pickup
would pull up an hour

18:28.270 --> 18:30.238
before dinner service.
We called it the "Ninja-mobile"

18:30.270 --> 18:32.909
because it had a white
throwing star on the door.
Zack would jump in,

18:35.440 --> 18:38.898
with a lot more focus,
if you know what I mean.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.271
- Hey, twelve's up. Let's go.
- That's me.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.448
Grab those
and stay close.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.290
She here with you?
- She wishes.

18:54.330 --> 18:56.355
- You two make a great team.
That was cute,

18:56.400 --> 18:58.459
that little stunt you pulled
with the tow truck.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.764
- I have no idea what you're
talking about.
- Come on,

19:00.800 --> 19:04.167
you didn't think I was gonna
track the car down? I ran
the VIN. It's registered

19:04.210 --> 19:06.201
to a Robyn Westing.
- Never heard of her.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.208
'Cause according
to her cell phone records,

19:08.240 --> 19:11.368
she called you this morning.
And now here you are in
the restaurant she co-owns.

19:14.850 --> 19:16.909
- Hey. Over here.

19:16.950 --> 19:20.488
- Oof. You mind if I...
move over here?

19:20.520 --> 19:22.249
I've got this old hockey injury.

19:22.290 --> 19:26.249
I can't stay in one position too
long. It's like a sciatic-- Hey!

19:27.700 --> 19:30.225
Oh, Detective,
you know, I...

19:30.270 --> 19:34.331
I do remember that phone call.
Robyn called me this morning
and invited me to come here.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.736
- To the Zack Beach
memorial dinner.
- Yeah, that's right.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.806
- Except he wasn't reported dead

19:38.840 --> 19:41.229
until after that.
- Lady,

19:41.280 --> 19:42.872
I didn't
order this.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.572
I'm allergic to shellfish.
I will literally die.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.959
- Uh, Detective Nolan,
we are in a bar.

19:53.990 --> 19:57.221
Maybe I can buy you a drink?
- Look, Shade, I don't know
what your game is,

19:57.260 --> 19:59.751
but you do not want to make
an enemy out of me, OK?

19:59.790 --> 20:01.792
Stay out of my way, and
that goes for Everett too.

20:04.030 --> 20:06.396
Oh, just a word
of advice.

20:06.430 --> 20:08.694
There are some things about
Angie that you don't know.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.959
So if I were you,
I'd find another hobby.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.433
Just that.

20:16.440 --> 20:19.705
- That was close.
- I don't know what I was
worried about.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.218
You're a natural.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.455
I swear, when you put
that wig on,

20:28.490 --> 20:31.584
your IQ legibly dropped
50 points. But the best

20:31.630 --> 20:34.929
-the best one of the night-
was you getting reamed out
by that customer

20:34.960 --> 20:36.928
you tried to kill.
- I didn't try to kill him--
- Ha, ha, ha!

20:36.960 --> 20:40.794
Oh, I don't know, in a court
of law, death by lobster
may carry the jury.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.037
- All that matters is
that Nolan didn't see me.
- Yeah, thanks to me.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.265
I had to do some serious
stick-handling in there.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.505
Guy probably thinks I'm nuts.
- He's got good instincts.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.508
- What's the deal
with you two, anyway?

20:50.550 --> 20:52.506
- Yeah.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.917
I mean, I can understand people
finding you irritating,
but his irritation

20:55.950 --> 20:57.645
has a certain depth.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.579
- He's just one of those cops
that hates PIs.
- No, no, no.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.759
It seemed more
personal than that.

21:02.790 --> 21:05.918
- No. No accounting for taste.
Aanay, tonight wasn't
a complete loss.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.996
Lindsay turned out
to be quite useful.

21:08.030 --> 21:11.921
Did she give you a
list of Zack's former lovers?
- Even better.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.632
I found out he had
a major drug problem.

21:14.670 --> 21:17.662
According to Lindsay,
he'd drive off in a red pickup

21:17.710 --> 21:20.577
with a throwing star logo on it
a few times a week.
- Huh.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.578
Maintaining a habit like that

21:22.610 --> 21:25.044
requires more than chump change.
You think he got in too deep?

21:25.080 --> 21:28.345
- Makes sense.
- I'll call Maz.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.486
Get him to cross reference the
vehicle registration database
with companies

21:31.520 --> 21:34.011
that have a throwing star logo.
Maybe we'll get luclq.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.936
- Wait. What are we gonna
tell Robyn

21:50.970 --> 21:54.098
We're gonna tell her the truth.

21:54.140 --> 21:57.029
- She's going to be upset.
- Better that she hears it
from us.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.878
- I want to protect her.
She doesn't deserve any of this.

21:59.910 --> 22:02.743
- You're not protecting her
by keeping her in the dark.

22:02.780 --> 22:06.887
- If I was getting in the way
of this investigation,
you'd tell me, right?

22:06.920 --> 22:09.582
- Are you fishing
for a compliment?
- I'm serious.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.054
We need to do
what's best for Robyn.

22:12.090 --> 22:14.126
- Let's go.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.822
It's freezing out here.

22:16.860 --> 22:20.091
- Ah, good, you're back.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.133
We're running out of Scotch.
- Dad, this is Angie.

22:23.170 --> 22:26.401
- Nice to meet you in person.
I helped your dad

22:26.440 --> 22:28.931
with a few wiretaps
back in the day.

22:28.980 --> 22:32.575
- You're the phone company guy.
- Yeah, that's right, 30 years.

22:32.610 --> 22:34.510
Now I consult,
bill 'em double.

22:34.550 --> 22:36.768
- Dad liked you.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.788
- Yeah, I liked him too.
He was a good man.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.788
I'm sorry he's gone.

22:40.820 --> 22:43.459
- Please tell me _
that you found something.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.958
- Maybe. But Detective
Nolan showed up.

22:45.990 --> 22:49.448
He tracked down your car.
- Oh my God.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.661
This can't be happening.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.634
- I'll go.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.884
- Not if we can help it.

23:21.030 --> 23:24.568
- Shade's confidence
is rubbing off on you.

23:26.730 --> 23:29.665
After Russ died, it was like...

23:29.700 --> 23:33.670
the air went out of me.

23:33.710 --> 23:36.201
It would have taken a natural
disaster to get me out of bed,

23:36.240 --> 23:38.970
let alone out the front door.
- Let me guess:

23:39.010 --> 23:42.116
Shade provided
the natural disaster.

23:42.150 --> 23:44.118
- He hired

23:44.150 --> 23:47.483
twenty Irish stepdancers
to jig and reel

23:47.520 --> 23:49.818
on my front porch
until I opened the door.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.158
He turned my anger

23:52.190 --> 23:54.226
into a block party.

23:54.260 --> 23:57.229
- Subtlety isn't
his strong suit.
- Yeah.

23:57.260 --> 23:59.490
Shade's a wildcard.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.868
But there is no one else
I'd turn to in a jam.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.547
- Best restaurant in town,
we didn't even eat.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.978
- I take it you have
an opinion on this.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.739
- Sure._
It's a great idea.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.951
Maybe she could start dating
a biker while she's at it.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.185
- Come on, Dad,
give her some credit.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.950
She's more mature
than you think.
- Smarter too.

24:25.990 --> 24:28.129
She waited to ask until
her mother left town.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.789
- Face it, son. You're
a soft target.

24:31.830 --> 24:34.094
Oh, don't get all
bent out of shape.

24:34.140 --> 24:38.065
It's the truth and you know it.
You're just used to being
"weekend Dad",

24:38.110 --> 24:41.102
you're not used to making
these tough calls.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.506
- You're making this decision
easier by the second.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.178
- She's your daughter, you do
what you think is right.

24:46.210 --> 24:49.839
But did you ever stop
to ask her why?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.048
- That was Mazhari.

24:56.090 --> 24:58.786
He found a match in the vehicle
registration database.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.889
Doug Boonstra,

25:00.930 --> 25:03.899
owner of CentreStrike
Enterprises, and a red pickup.

25:03.930 --> 25:07.730
Spent five years inside
for drug and assault.
- Zack's dealer.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.863
- Looks like he collected
on his debt.

25:16.980 --> 25:20.814
- This is the most uncomfortable
car I've ever sat in.
- It's a rental.

25:20.850 --> 25:24.741
- You're giving me a hard time
about my car and you can't
even commit to one?

25:24.790 --> 25:27.657
- It's not about commitment,
it's about being anonymous,
which is what we're trying to do

25:27.690 --> 25:31.182
right now.
- Well, can we at least
turn the rental car on?

25:31.230 --> 25:34.051
I'm freezing.
- I told you to bring
a sleeping bag.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.898
- No, you didn't.
- Oops.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.130
- We don't even know if this
Boonstra guy is going to show.

25:41.170 --> 25:43.764
- That's right.
We just have to wait.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.199
It's all part of being a PI.

25:49.980 --> 25:52.141
- Hey, have you got
anything to eat?

25:52.180 --> 25:56.014
I'm starving.
- You're a bundle
of needs, aren't you?

25:56.050 --> 25:59.986
Glove compartment.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.020
- It's a habit
I picked up from my dad.

26:05.060 --> 26:08.723
He was diabetic, he had to eat
every few hours in order
to keep his blood sugar up.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.069
We used to sit on stakeout
together and eat a whole
bag of these.

26:13.100 --> 26:17.366
Next time,
I'll bring the crackers.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.209
- Hm.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.004
- Are you seriously
angling for a job

26:22.040 --> 26:24.747
using my dad's memory?
- No.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.748
I was just being friendly.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.214
- Do you even know why
you want to be a PI?

26:29.250 --> 26:31.218
- It's becoming less
and less clear to me.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.117
- You haven't even thought it
through that far, have you?
- No, I haven't.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.913
Because I don't spend my life
thinking about every
little detail.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.781
I trust my gut. I improvise.
- I hate to break it to you,

26:39.830 --> 26:42.048
but in this business,
it's all about the details.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.989
Improvising doesn't work.
- Shut up.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.999
- No, shut up and look.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.234
- Oh.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.779
Let's go. But this time, we
stick to a plan. Follow my lead.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.074
- Right.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.787
You got a plan to get out
of that sleeping bag?

27:20.100 --> 27:22.091
Interesting taste in art.

27:32.380 --> 27:35.975
Standing by to follow
your lead, boss.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.386
- Let's come back later.
- OK.

27:40.790 --> 27:44.055
- Oh boy.

27:44.090 --> 27:47.150
Good boy. Nice doggy.
- Hey!

27:49.130 --> 27:52.190
- Now we improvise.
Is this the Bright Slq

27:52.230 --> 27:54.960
Travel Agency?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.366
- We're investigating
the death of Zack Beach.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.903
What was your
relationship to him?

27:59.940 --> 28:02.272
- I guess there's no harm

28:02.310 --> 28:05.347
in telling you now.
I was his sponsor.

28:10.850 --> 28:13.284
- I thought Zack
was still using.
- So did everybody.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.151
That's the way he wanted it.

28:15.190 --> 28:18.079
I didn't approve,
but he said it was important

28:18.130 --> 28:21.099
to maintain his "brand".

28:21.130 --> 28:24.395
- The hard-drinking,
party-all-night chef.
- Yeah, exactly.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.796
But in reality, man,
he'd given it all up:

28:26.830 --> 28:30.334
the drinking,
the drugs, even smoking.

28:30.370 --> 28:32.338
- So you'd show up
at the restaurant,

28:32.370 --> 28:35.305
and bring him here.
- Zack needed an outlet

28:35.340 --> 28:39.106
for all that stress. He'd throw
some blades, blow off steam.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.368
- Do you have any idea why he
suddenly decided to go clean?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.308
- It's always a bunch
of things, isn't it?

28:43.350 --> 28:46.478
But I figure
the big one was the fire.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.910
- Yeah, a little over

28:49.960 --> 28:52.121
six months ago, Zack was
drunk at the restaurant.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.048
One of the stations
in his kitchen caught fire

28:54.100 --> 28:56.398
and nearly burned
the place down.

28:56.430 --> 28:59.126
I'm pretty sure
that was rock bottom.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.058
- You get the impression
we're being misled?

29:07.210 --> 29:10.179
- She said she met Zack six
months ago. Smart girl like her,

29:10.210 --> 29:12.849
she would have done her due
diligence. Which means...

29:12.880 --> 29:15.144
- She knew about the fire.
- Ta-da.

29:15.180 --> 29:17.148
- No.

29:17.180 --> 29:19.148
No way. Robyn
wouldn't lie to me.

29:19.190 --> 29:22.182
- We've been friends
for 15 years!

29:22.220 --> 29:25.986
She's always been straight
with me, even when I didn't
want to hear it.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.157
Look,
when Becca and I

29:28.200 --> 29:31.897
were still fighting over custody
of Jules, I asked her what
she thought I should do.

29:31.930 --> 29:34.398
She could have just said,
"Hey, Jules is your kid too,

29:34.440 --> 29:37.534
you deserve 50-50." That's
what everybody else was saying.

29:37.570 --> 29:40.164
But she didn't.

29:40.210 --> 29:43.805
She sat me down, and she said
"The way you are right now,

29:43.850 --> 29:46.148
Jules is better off
with her mother."

29:48.880 --> 29:51.110
- You're still thinking
of her as a friend.

29:51.150 --> 29:53.311
_ But she's not a friend
right now, she's our client.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.217
Clients lie.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.854
Part of this job is learning
to spot the tells.

29:58.890 --> 30:01.199
The other part is figuring out
what to do once you've
found them.

30:01.230 --> 30:04.324
You need to decide who
you're going to be loyal to:

30:04.370 --> 30:07.168
your friends, or the truth.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.912
- Why didn't you
tell me about the fire?

30:29.960 --> 30:32.121
You lied to me.
- How did you

30:32.160 --> 30:34.219
find out?

30:41.200 --> 30:43.498
- Zack came to me
after it happened,

30:43.540 --> 30:46.031
told me he wanted to get clean.

30:46.070 --> 30:48.334
But I'd just poured
all my savings

30:48.380 --> 30:50.530
into the restaurant.
Everything that Russ left me.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.548
- And you were afraid
if Zack suddenly changed,

30:52.580 --> 30:55.219
you'd lose it all.
No more "bad boy" chef.

30:55.250 --> 30:58.083
- We were barely
breaking even as it was.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.441
And people expected
"the Zack show"

31:00.490 --> 31:03.152
when they came
for dinner. So...

31:03.190 --> 31:06.182
I asked him

31:06.230 --> 31:08.289
to pretend that
he was still using.

31:08.330 --> 31:11.060
- You're talking
about that video.
- It was fake.

31:11.100 --> 31:15.036
He was keeping up the facade.
He had been for the past
six months.

31:24.510 --> 31:27.604
- Robyn, go inside.
- Hold it right there,

31:27.650 --> 31:29.675
Ms. Westing.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.688
You're under arrest
for the murder

31:31.720 --> 31:34.314
of Zack Beach.
- She didn't do it.
- Found a knife

31:34.360 --> 31:36.385
in her apartment that matches
the profile of the victim's
wound.

31:36.420 --> 31:39.127
- There must be a million knives
that match that profile.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.151
- Maybe. But when you consider
her fingerprints

31:41.200 --> 31:43.259
were all over the scene,
people heard them fighting,

31:43.300 --> 31:44.790
and Zack had just cleared out
her life savings, well,

31:44.830 --> 31:48.698
that number becomes a little
less relevant, don't you think?
Come on, let's go.

31:48.740 --> 31:52.107
- Hey.

31:52.140 --> 31:55.303
How about you go back
to cross-checking or whatever
it is you're good at, OK?

31:55.340 --> 31:57.331
This isn't for you.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.928
***

32:18.130 --> 32:21.531
- Hey, Wilson, it's Angie.
I was just calling to see
if you needed any follow-up

32:21.570 --> 32:24.539
on that workman's comp case.
Let me know.

32:24.570 --> 32:27.107
- Hey.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.573
Nolan came by my house.
He's got Robyn.

32:28.610 --> 32:31.078
- OK.

32:31.110 --> 32:33.146
She's been charged with
murder. We need a plan.

32:33.180 --> 32:35.375
Break her out of jail?

32:35.420 --> 32:37.570
- To find out who the real
killer is!
- Shade...

32:37.620 --> 32:41.181
- So get your coat
and help me figure this out.
- Robyn lied to us about Zack.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.313
She was scared.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.487
She'd just invested
everything she had

32:45.530 --> 32:48.624
in the Zack Beach brand, and
all of a sudden he wanted
to blow it all up.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.220
She was afraid if she told us,
she'd look guilty.

32:51.270 --> 32:54.137
- She was right. But at least
she would've been honest.

32:54.170 --> 32:55.831
- You think she really did this.

32:55.870 --> 32:59.101
- He stole her money. Took away
her hopes and dreams, her one
chance to build a new life

32:59.140 --> 33:01.700
after her husband died. What
do yo think that did to her?

33:01.740 --> 33:05.449
- Hey, I've been ripped off too,
and God knows I'd love to stick
a knife in my ex-manager.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.040
But Robyn's different.
She'd never do that.

33:08.080 --> 33:12.016
- You're too caught up in this.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.081
- I think this is yours.

33:35.210 --> 33:38.247
- Detective Everett, Homicide.
I need to check something.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.113
- I didn't know you were coming.
- That's typical.

33:58.330 --> 34:01.595
- Son of a bitch.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.481
- You stole my father's
police badge.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.752
Me?]No!
- I'm just at the grocery store,

34:23.790 --> 34:27.157
picking up a few items.
Hey, are these kumquats fresh?

34:27.190 --> 34:29.249
- Shade, I'm outside. I can see
your Porsche down the block.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.292
You need to get out of there
right now.

34:32.330 --> 34:34.764
- Not until I find something
that'll help Robyn.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.859
- Do you have any idea how much
trouble you'll be in
if you get caught?

34:36.900 --> 34:39.334
- Not as much trouble
as she's in right now.

34:40.410 --> 34:42.401
Wait.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.770
- Oh, crap.

34:48.450 --> 34:50.213
Shade".

34:52.620 --> 34:54.884
Shade! Can you hear me?
Get out of there!

34:54.920 --> 34:58.185
Shade!

34:59.360 --> 35:02.329
- Relax. I found something.
- Get out now. Nolan's here.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.193
- Whoever you are,

35:05.230 --> 35:09.132
I know you're in here.
- Find another exit.

35:11.340 --> 35:14.207
- There isn't one.
- Come on out and
I'll go easy on you.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.368
- Just do it!

35:23.320 --> 35:26.312
- Come on...

35:26.350 --> 35:29.217
Come on, where are you?

35:29.260 --> 35:30.784
VVhoa!

35:30.820 --> 35:34.199
Are you nuts? My car!
- It's a rental.

35:34.230 --> 35:35.822
- Get in.

35:35.860 --> 35:38.897
Hurry up!

35:40.900 --> 35:43.892
What's that? _
- Zack Beach was opening
a new restaurant.

35:53.550 --> 35:55.472
You know I've already

35:55.520 --> 35:57.112
been cleared by the police.
- Zack Beach

35:57.150 --> 36:00.779
was opening a new restaurant,
and you were his partner.
- Keep your voice down.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.788
- We found the construction
plans; your name was all over

36:02.820 --> 36:04.754
them. A French bistro
in Prince Edward County.

36:05.990 --> 36:08.493
- Zack came to me shortly after
the knife incident.

36:08.530 --> 36:11.795
He said he was clean and sober,
and wanted to start fresh

36:11.830 --> 36:15.197
somewhere new, close Pravda.
We made a deal

36:15.240 --> 36:17.663
to work together.
- I thought you hated him.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.339
- He drove me crazy,
but I didn't hate him.

36:20.370 --> 36:22.338
Having him in the neighbourhood
made me better.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.348
- So what about
this place?

36:24.380 --> 36:26.348
- I've already made
arrangements to sell it.

36:26.380 --> 36:29.349
I was meeting
with my financial advisor

36:29.380 --> 36:31.519
to finalize the details
the night Zack was killed.

36:31.550 --> 36:34.883
- Avignon Stars.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.718
- Bchamel is the only
restaurant in the city
to earn a four-star rating.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.682
- Like that photo you took
at Zack's place.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.961
- Just Taylor and I.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.992
: Did she know
you were selling this place?

36:50.040 --> 36:52.235
- Any chance she could have
found out on her own?

36:55.010 --> 36:57.308
- Taylor, how long
have you worked here?

36:57.340 --> 36:59.205
Ten years?

37:01.280 --> 37:03.976
- Twelve.
- That's loyalty.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.739
You must have been really upset
when you found out Helen was
selling the restaurant.

37:06.790 --> 37:10.612
We found this
in Zack's apartment.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.423
It's an Avignon Star.
Just like the one

37:12.460 --> 37:14.451
that you're missing
from your lapel.

37:16.330 --> 37:19.993
Why were you
giving up like that?

37:20.030 --> 37:23.397
- I wasn't--
- After all the years we've
spent building up this place!

37:23.440 --> 37:26.364
And you were gonna let it all go
because of that monster!

37:26.410 --> 37:28.537
I killed for you!
- Taylor, don't do

37:28.580 --> 37:30.400
anything stupid!
- Helen, go!

37:35.350 --> 37:37.739
- Wow. So we're hitting
girls now, huh?

37:37.780 --> 37:40.442
- She had a knife!
- No, but you really hit her.

37:40.490 --> 37:43.516
Like, you hit her hard.
She's probably got a concussion.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.585
Like, you would have sent
that girl to the hospital.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.825
That probably wasn't necessary,
was it?

37:47.860 --> 37:49.748
***

37:58.710 --> 38:01.065
- What is it with you two
showing up at my crime scenes?

38:01.110 --> 38:03.806
- You can thank us later.
I take cash or cheque.

38:06.710 --> 38:10.316
What are you doing?
- I am arresting your
partner here

38:10.350 --> 38:12.716
for obstruction of justice
and impersonating

38:12.750 --> 38:15.457
a police officer.
- How have you been getting
away with it for so long?

38:15.490 --> 38:17.458
- Give me a break, Nolan.
We just solved your case.

38:17.490 --> 38:19.458
- I don't make the rules;
I just follow them,

38:19.490 --> 38:21.321
which is more than I can say
for you two.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.897
I can't make a move without you

38:23.930 --> 38:25.818
breathing down my neck?
- I don't know. You tell me.

38:25.870 --> 38:28.395
So that is the new guy?

38:28.440 --> 38:31.091
That's your dad's replacement?

38:31.140 --> 38:34.007
Wow. You used to know
where the line was, Everett;

38:34.040 --> 38:36.372
now I'm starting to wonder.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.439
- Then I guess we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

39:03.770 --> 39:06.409
- Angie, good to see you.

39:08.140 --> 39:10.734
Hm!

39:10.780 --> 39:12.975
Carol and I are gonna
stop inviting you to dinner

39:13.010 --> 39:15.570
unless we get a yes soon.
- I know. I'm sorry.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.372
I appreciate you
checking in on me.

39:17.420 --> 39:20.912
Must be hard being on your own.

39:20.950 --> 39:23.953
- That's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

39:23.990 --> 39:27.721
- Ah. Is this about
Mr. Shade by chance?

39:27.760 --> 39:31.059
He had quite the adventure
over the last 72 hours.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.092
- Yes, but he was also
responsible for catching

39:34.130 --> 39:36.098
a murderer the police
weren't even looking at

39:36.140 --> 39:38.096
and saving an innocent woman
from going to jail.

39:38.140 --> 39:40.028
- I don't know
if that justiﬁes what he did.

39:40.070 --> 39:42.504
"Hiring a tow truck
to remove evidence,

39:42.540 --> 39:45.771
concealing a suspect in his
house, impersonating
a police officer."

39:45.810 --> 39:48.108
- Does it help that
he wasn't very good at it?

39:48.150 --> 39:50.846
- He also hit
on a booking clerk.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.940
- Look, I know
Shade's a bit of a loose cannon

39:53.990 --> 39:56.618
and incredibly annoying
and bull-headed,

39:56.660 --> 39:58.651
but sometimes,
that's useful and,

39:58.690 --> 40:02.057
truthfully, he's got
really good instincts,

40:02.100 --> 40:05.069
and he never gives up.
Even when he should.

40:05.100 --> 40:08.024
- Sounds like you're trying
to talk yourself into something.

40:08.070 --> 40:10.595
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

40:17.210 --> 40:19.804
- You look amazing, honey,

40:19.850 --> 40:22.114
and you're gonna knock 'em dead.
- Yeah, you have to say that.

40:22.150 --> 40:24.118
- It's true!

40:24.150 --> 40:26.141
- Bye.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.817
- Jules...

40:27.850 --> 40:30.489
- Uh-oh! I know that voice.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.226
Is this
about my tattoo?

40:32.260 --> 40:35.195
- Look, you know
I wanna back you

40:35.230 --> 40:38.051
as much as I can, it's just...

40:38.100 --> 40:40.193
That's a really big decision,

40:40.230 --> 40:42.790
and you're only
14 years old. I'm just not

40:42.840 --> 40:45.707
sure that--
OK, look,

40:45.740 --> 40:48.163
I love the fact that you went to
the trouble of writing a speech,

40:48.210 --> 40:50.178
but I'm getting
old over here.

40:50.210 --> 40:52.542
- OK. Tell me why.

40:52.580 --> 40:55.071
And the real reason,
not just 'cause it's cool.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.548
- I need to be able
to walk into that school

40:59.590 --> 41:02.616
with something that...
that shows people who I am.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.049
You know. Otherwise, I'm just
"that kid from the wait list."

41:05.090 --> 41:08.082
- And you think a tattoo's
gonna change that?

41:08.130 --> 41:10.052
- Well, it can't hurt.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.022
- Jules...

41:13.970 --> 41:15.892
...people are gonna treat you
the way they're gonna treat you,

41:15.940 --> 41:17.896
and the best way
to show people who you are

41:17.940 --> 41:19.931
is by being yourself.

41:21.940 --> 41:24.500
- You're right.
- Sorry, one of my concussions

41:24.550 --> 41:26.575
must be recurring.
I could have sworn

41:26.610 --> 41:28.669
I heard you agree with me.
- They're cool and all,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.938
but I've got better things
to do with my body.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.540
See you, Dad.
: OK.

41:33.590 --> 41:35.558
Wait, what better things?

41:35.590 --> 41:37.114
***

41:40.330 --> 41:44.152
- ** It's gonna take
a bit of work *

41:46.300 --> 41:49.030
* Oh oh work

41:49.070 --> 41:50.992
- Sorry, I should
have called.

41:51.040 --> 41:52.928
- That's all right.
What's up?

41:52.970 --> 41:54.938
- I just thought you should know
that Robyn's been cleared

41:54.980 --> 41:57.005
of all charges.
- Yeah, I heard.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.873
- Right, of course.
You guys are friends. Uh...

42:02.580 --> 42:05.083
- * People come and go

42:05.120 --> 42:07.088
- Six months ago,
I went after a witness

42:07.120 --> 42:10.112
a little too hard. Nolan charged
me with criminal harassment.

42:10.160 --> 42:13.152
That's what's between us.
- Wow!

42:13.190 --> 42:15.021
OK.

42:15.060 --> 42:17.119
- Yeah.
- Is there a reason

42:17.160 --> 42:19.697
you're telling me this?
- I don't like keeping secrets

42:19.730 --> 42:22.790
from people I'm working with.

42:22.840 --> 42:26.003
- You're reckless, impulsive,
and - most frighteningly -

42:26.040 --> 42:28.008
have no grasp of how much
you don't know yet.

42:28.040 --> 42:31.203
- It means the world you're
telling me this in person.

42:31.240 --> 42:34.243
- But I also think, judging
from the last week or so,

42:34.280 --> 42:36.578
that there's a chance
we might work well together.

42:38.250 --> 42:40.309
- Are... are you
offering me a job?

42:40.350 --> 42:43.751
- My dad always used to say,
"Move forward or die,"

42:43.790 --> 42:47.180
and while the latter seems
wildly preferable right now,

42:47.230 --> 42:49.255
yes...
- * Gonna take a little time

42:49.300 --> 42:53.122
- ...I'm offering you a job.
- OK.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.161
- On a temporary,
probationary basis,

42:55.200 --> 42:57.168
subject to you passing
the P.I. exam and

42:57.200 --> 42:59.202
other caveats I may add later.
- All right.

42:59.240 --> 43:01.629
- * I won't let go
- I accept.

43:04.780 --> 43:06.247
So you want to come inside,

43:06.280 --> 43:09.044
tell Don, watch him
try to talk you out of it?

43:09.080 --> 43:11.014
- It's fine, I should go.

43:11.050 --> 43:13.143
- He's pretty entertaining,
you might enjoy it.

43:13.190 --> 43:15.078
Come on, Angie,
try something new.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.953
- * But you should know
- One step at a time, Shade.

43:17.990 --> 43:19.924
See you tomorrow.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.019
- OK.
- * That I

43:22.060 --> 43:25.791
* That I

43:25.830 --> 43:27.991
* I'm taking it slow

43:31.340 --> 43:35.879
* Oooh oooooh
