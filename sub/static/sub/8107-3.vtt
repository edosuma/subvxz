00:16.017 --> 00:17.769
It's cold.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.734
Good. Thank you.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.821
There's a new girl
at the ice cream store.

00:28.530 --> 00:31.533
She doesn't seem too fond
of buttoning her top button.

00:31.658 --> 00:33.034
Let's go check her out.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.494
What are we
supposed to be doing?

01:57.619 --> 01:58.995
It's almost 4:00.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.663
You got somewhere to be?

02:00.789 --> 02:02.791
We know he likes
to manipulate people.

02:02.916 --> 02:04.918
He's probably testing us.

02:05.043 --> 02:06.669
To find out what?

02:06.795 --> 02:08.505
How long we can
look stupid for?

02:10.757 --> 02:12.467
He said
he'd be here by 3:00.

02:12.592 --> 02:14.260
He's obviously not coming.

02:16.054 --> 02:17.764
- I'm going home.
- Nobody follow her.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.942
Would you mind holding
my metaphor for a second?

02:29.067 --> 02:32.070
New patient,
37-year-old male.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.364
Suffers from severe
ascending muscle weakness.

02:34.489 --> 02:36.199
- Why are you late?
- To see who'd put up with it.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.867
So, if we'd have left,
we would have been fired?

02:37.992 --> 02:39.828
I was going to fire
whoever stuck around,

02:39.953 --> 02:41.996
but since
everyone stuck around...

02:45.583 --> 02:49.712
28% curvature of the spine
has caused reduced lung capacity

02:49.838 --> 02:51.464
and he has reduced
the bone mineral density.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.883
The patient has
spinal muscular atrophy.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.719
It's genetic, incurable.

02:56.845 --> 02:58.471
This is not
a diagnostic mystery.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.266
You have just given
the state secrets to the enemy.

03:01.391 --> 03:03.393
- What enemy?
- New patient, new rules.

03:03.518 --> 03:06.062
Today, you're going to
split yourselves into two teams.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.314
The first to figure out what's
threatening to deprive the patient

03:08.439 --> 03:10.567

03:13.862 --> 03:15.655
Take off your numbers.
You look stupid.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.156
And I think I know
who you are by now.

03:17.282 --> 03:18.950
Wait, how do you
want us to split up?

03:19.075 --> 03:22.579
Good question,
Overly Excited Former Foster Kid.

03:22.704 --> 03:25.957
There's 10 of you. I was thinking
six against six? No, wait.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.584
How about women versus men?

03:27.709 --> 03:30.336
Excellent suggestion, Fat Twin.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.338
More interesting
than evens versus odds.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.049
Less interesting
than shirts against skins.

03:35.174 --> 03:38.344
If your sex organs dangle,
you're the Confederates.

03:38.469 --> 03:41.556
If your sex organs are aesthetically
pleasing, you're the Yanks.

03:41.681 --> 03:44.767
Dr. House?
I'd like to be on the men's team.

03:44.893 --> 03:47.729
Do your sex organs dangle,
Cutthroat Bitch?

03:47.854 --> 03:50.023
Not yet.
You've never hired more

03:50.148 --> 03:52.025
than one female
on your team before.

03:52.150 --> 03:53.943
If you're going to
purge an entire gender

03:54.068 --> 03:55.737
it isn't going
to be the danglers.

03:55.862 --> 03:59.699
Sounds logical, if you don't think
about it for more than three seconds.

03:59.824 --> 04:02.368
I just told you that
if the danglers lose, they're out.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.913
So, I can only assume
you're hiding the real reason.

04:05.038 --> 04:06.831
You don't think the women
will be aggressive enough,

04:06.956 --> 04:08.958
will be good enough at science.
They'll be too emotional.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.418
Can I switch teams?

04:12.337 --> 04:14.130
If the danglers are okay,
I'm okay.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.174
- We're not okay.
- I get it.

04:16.299 --> 04:19.052
You don't like me because maybe
I'm a little bit competitive.

04:19.177 --> 04:20.011
Manipulative.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.846
"Cutthroat Bitch"
is your official title.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.432
It's a game. You can either play
for fun or play to win.

04:24.557 --> 04:27.435
If you want to win,
you want "Cutthroat".

04:27.685 --> 04:29.395
No, thank you.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.940
First thing we have to
do is get inside his head.

04:32.065 --> 04:33.274
It's not psychological.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.443
I'm not talking about the patient,
I'm talking about House.

04:35.568 --> 04:38.196
He's insane,
but he's not irresponsible.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.657
He wouldn't be playing this game
if he didn't already know the answer.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.533
The first thing we do
is gang-bang the sucker.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.411
There's five of us.
We can run dozens of tests.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.622
We don't need a theory.
We just need brute force.

04:47.747 --> 04:49.332
What about the assist dog?

04:49.457 --> 04:52.543
Picks bacteria-infested things up
with its bacteria-infested mouth,

04:52.669 --> 04:53.670
hands them over to the guy...

04:53.795 --> 04:55.505
It's not the dog, wouldn't be fair.

04:55.630 --> 04:57.507
- To who?
- Whom.

04:57.632 --> 05:00.218
The men.
House knows I used to be a vet.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.720
If the dog's the answer,
they'd be at a handicap.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.055
What about the dog?

05:04.180 --> 05:05.556
Assist dogs put
everything in their mouth.

05:05.682 --> 05:06.849
Money, doorknobs...

05:06.975 --> 05:09.102
- Great.
- That's not what I said.

05:09.227 --> 05:10.895
- Why do you think a low sodium...
- I don't.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.064
Patient took a trip to Thailand
two weeks ago.

05:13.189 --> 05:15.692
Hey, write bigger and angle the board
more so they can see it.

05:15.817 --> 05:16.651
This is wrong.

05:16.776 --> 05:17.986
It's only wrong
if they cheat off us.

05:18.111 --> 05:19.237
And if they cheat off us,
they're wrong.

05:19.362 --> 05:22.281
They're not cheating,
but one of them is moving.

05:26.786 --> 05:29.706
Hey. Stop playing with your sutures
or I'll have to re-do them.

05:29.831 --> 05:33.251
Why do you guys keep a D-cell battery
in a urine specimen cup?

05:33.376 --> 05:35.378
Because we pulled it
from a patient's intestine.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.714
Why would somebody
swallow a battery?

05:37.839 --> 05:40.091
Why do you assume
it was swallowed?

05:40.216 --> 05:42.051
Bed five needs a bag
of Ringer's lactate.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.846
Would have been worse
if he'd used a nine-volt.

05:44.971 --> 05:46.931
Who said it was a "he"?

05:47.056 --> 05:48.474
False assumptions.
You're good.

05:48.599 --> 05:49.934
You're trying to get me
to think like him.

05:50.059 --> 05:53.438
And you're trying to kiss my ass.
Why are you talking to me?

05:53.563 --> 05:57.483
Because House is turning patient care
into a game. It's dangerous.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.695
The patient's going to suffer.
Maybe die.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.704
Wow! You really need a shave.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.457
See what I did there?

06:13.374 --> 06:14.667
Whoa.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.760
Interesting.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.890
I need a crash cart in here!

06:38.357 --> 06:39.901
I didn't do it.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.404
When a person faints,
it's because they're

06:43.529 --> 06:44.947
not getting enough blood
to their brain.

06:45.073 --> 06:47.158
The act of falling
corrects the problem.

06:47.283 --> 06:50.912
You faint again strapped into
that power chair where you can't fall,

06:51.037 --> 06:52.288
you might not wake up.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.082
Killed by an assistive device?

06:54.207 --> 06:55.875
At least my death would be ironic.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.959
I think when you
went to Thailand,

06:57.085 --> 06:59.629
you picked up a threadworm
called strongyloides.

06:59.754 --> 07:00.963
They usually go up
through your feet.

07:01.089 --> 07:03.132
I didn't do a lot of walking
on the beach.

07:03.257 --> 07:06.219
But I assume you did have someone
lay you down in the sand.

07:06.344 --> 07:10.598
Bare back, bare legs increases
exposure tenfold over bare feet.

07:12.058 --> 07:14.769
Two pills.
You'll be all better.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.650
Can I have some water
for those, please?

07:24.821 --> 07:25.738
Hey, take a number!

07:25.863 --> 07:27.240
House didn't say anything
about taking turns.

07:27.365 --> 07:28.282
What's she testing you for?

07:28.407 --> 07:31.244
Don't. They'll spend all day
obsessing over my idea

07:31.369 --> 07:33.538
instead of coming up
with one of their own.

07:33.663 --> 07:35.706
And, hey, I might be wrong.

07:35.832 --> 07:37.458
Seriously.
I'm worried that if we don't know

07:37.583 --> 07:39.001
what she's given you,
there could be conflicts.

07:39.127 --> 07:40.169
No, you're not.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.296
House told me
he's keeping track of all that.

07:42.421 --> 07:45.174
Ten doctors.
I should be getting ten cures.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.802
We need blood, hair, and stool.

07:47.927 --> 07:51.097
You poop and then you use the wooden
sticks to collect the fecal matter,

07:51.222 --> 07:52.723
then rub it on the green box.

07:52.849 --> 07:54.016
Hand it to my dog.

07:54.142 --> 07:55.685
Only one of those things
I can do on my own.

07:55.810 --> 07:58.855
And the last couple of days,
I haven't been doing that.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.983
Is it all right with you
if we carry you into the bathroom?

08:02.108 --> 08:05.778
If you want me there, that's the way
you're going to have to do it.

08:12.827 --> 08:14.787
Okay-

08:15.163 --> 08:16.122
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:16.247 --> 08:18.207
One, two, three.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.127
Can I get a little head support, please?
Thank you.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.314
Why are you here?

08:41.439 --> 08:44.192
My offices are being used
by my teams.

08:46.152 --> 08:47.028
Teams?

08:47.153 --> 08:49.197
Which means this is the only place
where you can yell at me.

08:49.322 --> 08:50.823
You have "teams"?

08:50.948 --> 08:51.782
Two of them.

08:51.908 --> 08:53.367
I wanted to deal
with the yelling today

08:53.492 --> 08:54.869
because I noticed
what you were wearing,

08:54.994 --> 08:57.663
and I wouldn't have to listen
all that closely.

08:58.164 --> 09:00.124
You can't make a competition
out of patient care.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.920
Without competition,
we'd still be single cell organisms.

09:04.045 --> 09:06.380
- Can I go now?
- Not until after the yelling.

09:06.505 --> 09:07.381
What's wrong with him?

09:07.506 --> 09:09.634
I have seven of
the finest minds on it.

09:09.759 --> 09:10.801
Along with three very special...

09:10.927 --> 09:13.095
You wouldn't be doing this
unless you already knew.

09:13.221 --> 09:14.805
I tell you, you tell them.
Game's over.

09:14.931 --> 09:16.933
If you know,
you are obligated to treat...

09:17.058 --> 09:19.936
Well, then, in that case,
I don't know.

09:20.478 --> 09:24.398
Why would a guy voluntarily shove

09:24.523 --> 09:26.817
a metal object
into an electrical socket?

09:26.943 --> 09:30.363
I'm getting closer and closer
to knowing the answer.

09:30.488 --> 09:32.615
What would happen
if I shut down this game?

09:32.740 --> 09:35.701
I'd fire them all,
hire 40 new fellowship applicants

09:35.826 --> 09:38.371
and start the game
all over again.

09:38.496 --> 09:40.289
You do know what's
wrong with him, right?

09:40.414 --> 09:43.334
It would be pretty irresponsible
if I didn't, wouldn't it?

09:48.256 --> 09:49.715
WOMAN:
Antibiotics aren't working.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.134
MAN 1: Legionella could
explain the lungs, the fever.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.637
If she had Legionella,
she'd have low sodium.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.639
What can you
tell me about her?

09:56.764 --> 09:57.932
WOMAN:
She likes body surfing.

09:58.057 --> 10:00.643
Maybe picked up a virus
swimming off Jones Beach.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.145
But she doesn't even have the energy
to finish her crossword anymore.

10:03.271 --> 10:04.230
MAN 2:
Her boyfriend said...

10:04.355 --> 10:05.731
That's it.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.191
- What is?
- Blurry vision.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.026
How do you get blurry vision
from not being...

10:09.151 --> 10:12.655
You don't stop a daily ritual
that cures boredom because you're bored.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.156
She stopped doing
her crossword puzzle

10:14.282 --> 10:15.908
because she's having
a hard time reading it.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.911
What causes fever, boggy lungs,
and blurry vision?

10:19.036 --> 10:21.122
fungal
Aspergillus would explain

10:21.247 --> 10:23.541
the pneumonia,
which explains the fever.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.376
Start her on amphotericin.

10:27.086 --> 10:29.380
Hey, guys. Great job.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.427
(SIGHING)

10:38.597 --> 10:43.394
If you were going to try to take
yourself out, why choose electricity?

10:43.519 --> 10:45.855
You eat a bullet,
jump off a building...

10:45.980 --> 10:47.982
I love the team thing,
by the way.

10:48.107 --> 10:50.484
Bury yourself alive
in Cuddy's cleavage.

10:50.609 --> 10:54.155
Teamwork, collaboration,
all for the greater good...

10:54.280 --> 10:56.449
It could have been
a suicidal gesture

10:56.615 --> 10:58.617
as opposed to
an actual attempt.

10:58.743 --> 11:01.412
Interestingly,
the rain in Spain doesn't

11:01.537 --> 11:04.290
actually fall
in the plain all that much.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.209
But who puts
their internal organs

11:07.335 --> 11:09.295
on a skillet
just to get attention?

11:09.420 --> 11:11.130
Go ask him.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.884
That would be cheating.

11:18.179 --> 11:19.638
Got a diagnosis yet?

11:19.764 --> 11:20.639
Get out of here.

11:20.765 --> 11:22.058
Got a stool sample yet?

11:22.183 --> 11:23.017
How could you know?

11:23.142 --> 11:26.312
Oh, I talked to a nurse.
Pretty brilliant, huh?

11:26.437 --> 11:29.565
I give you a move House will love
straight from one of his former fellows

11:29.690 --> 11:30.983
and you let me join your team.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.319
You're too late.
We already have our diagnosis.

11:33.444 --> 11:36.781
He's lying because
he wants you to go away.

11:36.906 --> 11:37.740
So do I.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.116
How do we know
you're not a double agent?

11:39.241 --> 11:41.035
Find out what we're thinking
then go back to the women.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.079
Because I don't care
what you're thinking.

11:43.204 --> 11:45.039
You want to know why
I want to be on your team?

11:45.164 --> 11:46.165
Because you're idiots.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.959
If I can get the women
out of the competition, I'm in.

11:49.085 --> 11:50.961
And so are two of you.

12:03.224 --> 12:05.351
So what's the big move?

12:05.684 --> 12:07.645
It's called xenodiagnosis.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.898
We let these bugs bite you,
then we test their feces for parasites.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.775
Why can't you test my feces?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.277
Because you've been chugging
milk of magnesia for the past hour.

12:15.403 --> 12:17.613
You've got a lot going in
and nothing coming out.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.325
Testing the bugs' feces is actually
more accurate than testing yours.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.078
Smaller haystack,
easier to find the needle.

12:28.124 --> 12:30.292
You okay?
Get the bugs off him.

12:30.418 --> 12:31.627
(DOG BARKING)

12:31.752 --> 12:33.796
(RAPID BEEPING)

12:33.921 --> 12:36.090
- Get the bugs off him!
- The test isn't done.

12:36.215 --> 12:37.633
He's choking!

12:47.017 --> 12:49.687
<i>HOUSE: Patchy infiltrates
on the X-ray, but patient</i>

12:49.812 --> 12:53.065
<i>improved with chest PT and oxygen,
consistent with aspiration.</i>

12:53.190 --> 12:55.401
So, now we have
another symptom to explain.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.696
Why does his throat think
his lungs are his stomach?

13:00.990 --> 13:02.950
And why are your
throats closing up?

13:03.075 --> 13:04.618
Shouldn't we be in separate rooms?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.370
You think I'm going to run
two differentials

13:06.495 --> 13:08.914
at this time in the morning?
Grumpy, you're first.

13:09.039 --> 13:09.874
I'm not grumpy.

13:09.999 --> 13:12.543
Well, why would I call you that
if you weren't?

13:12.668 --> 13:14.462
It's an unusual combination.

13:14.587 --> 13:16.839
Unusual equals
exotic equals foreign.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.674
It has to be connected
to his trip to Thailand.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.301
You practice medicine overseas?

13:20.426 --> 13:22.511
I was with Doctors Without Borders
for eight years.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.847
- Ta-da!
- It's in my file.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.141
David Blaine hides
the six of hearts in a beer bottle.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.726
It's still impressive.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.645
- You like exotic. Why are you here?
- I want this job.

13:31.770 --> 13:32.605
HOUSE: Parent sick?

13:32.730 --> 13:34.523
No. I... I just...

13:34.648 --> 13:35.941
This is not the job you want.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.776
This is the job
in the zip code you want.

13:37.902 --> 13:39.028
You engaged?

13:39.153 --> 13:39.987
Yes.

13:40.112 --> 13:40.946
Ta-da!

13:41.071 --> 13:43.574
Am I not allowed to grow up
and change my priorities?

13:43.699 --> 13:45.951
You're allowed to.
People usually don't.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.453
This is not a new symptom.

13:47.578 --> 13:49.705
Our patient has
spinal muscular atrophy.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.624
He has documented trouble swallowing.

13:51.749 --> 13:52.875
The choking is not new.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.169
So, if it's nothing new,
what caused the old?

13:55.294 --> 13:58.339
Strongyloides worms explain
the fainting. We already treated...

13:58.464 --> 14:02.259
So, he's all better,
woman who... Thirteen.

14:02.384 --> 14:03.260
He hasn't gotten any worse.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.305
That's a pretty passive approach
for the daughter of an alcoholic.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.389
Wrong again.

14:07.515 --> 14:10.142
We could stress his system,
put him on a tilt table.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.479
If he stays conscious, it means
we made the right diagnosis and we win.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.022
Then, why haven't you?

14:17.608 --> 14:20.069
Six against four.

14:20.361 --> 14:23.531
One of the men is going
to have to join the women's team.

14:23.656 --> 14:25.574
On the other hand,
one of the men isn't

14:25.699 --> 14:28.911
an actual doctor,
so I guess it's pretty fair.

14:30.371 --> 14:32.331
Men, you're in the penalty box.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.749
Who's not the doctor?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.793
Glad you asked about that.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.796
The reason I'm penalizing you
is time management.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.715
In diagnostics,
you're always working against the clock.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.134
The women came up with a theory
and they treated the patient.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.511
You guys just
sat around in a lab,

14:45.636 --> 14:48.347
hoping a series of blind tests
would give you a theory.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.016
You wasted the patient's time.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.060
Now, I'm going to waste yours.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.979
Her gums are turning yellow.

14:55.104 --> 14:57.273
Whatever it is,
it's in her liver now.

14:57.398 --> 14:59.149
Fungal fit perfectly.

14:59.275 --> 15:01.569
We were wrong.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.737
And we're going to keep being wrong
until we're right.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.322
Or until she dies.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.116
Yeah. That was very helpful.

15:07.575 --> 15:10.744
Need a team to tell me
we're mortals.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.790
Look. I'm sorry.
You're right.

15:15.124 --> 15:19.587
Doesn't hurt to be reminded that
we're dealing with real stakes, here.

15:19.712 --> 15:22.965
Liver failure is a bad thing,
but it's also a clue.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.883
What does it tell us?

15:33.392 --> 15:36.937
I can't let you leave
if I think you're still suicidal.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.023
I wasn't
trying to off myself.

15:39.148 --> 15:42.860
No, that's right, you were
just trying to kill the wall.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.738
I check this box,
and your next roommates

15:45.863 --> 15:48.907
are going to be
Jesus and Crazy McLoonybin.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.869
That guy never had a chance.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.746
It's going to sound stupid.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.623
Suddenly, you're shy?

15:55.748 --> 15:57.625
You pooped your
pants in front of me.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.877
It's one of the nasty
side effects of dying.

16:05.549 --> 16:08.344
Last Saturday
I got in a car crash.

16:09.053 --> 16:12.723
A drunk driver came over the line
and hit me, head on.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.017
It was like slow motion.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.978
I saw these headlights,

16:18.729 --> 16:20.064
then,

16:21.148 --> 16:22.524
I saw...

16:25.486 --> 16:31.075
Paramedics said I was
technically dead for 97 seconds.

16:34.453 --> 16:38.707
It was the best 97 seconds
of my life.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.549
Okay, here's what happened.

16:47.675 --> 16:50.803
Your oxygen-deprived brain
was shutting down.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.598
A flood of endorphins
and serotonin was released.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.183
That's what gave you the visions.

16:56.308 --> 17:00.145
No. Believe me.
It wasn't chemicals.

17:00.688 --> 17:03.190
I've done every hallucinogenic
there is.

17:04.149 --> 17:06.276
This was way bigger than that.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.657
There's something out there.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.953
Something more.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.332
Hey, can I have
my knife back?

17:20.457 --> 17:21.583
Nope.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.422
Who the hell isn't a doctor?

17:26.547 --> 17:27.798
House said we can't talk.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.258
He meant we can't talk about the case.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.468
House is just jerking us around.

17:31.593 --> 17:32.428
That's what he does.

17:32.553 --> 17:33.971
You're not curious.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.723
Only one reason
you wouldn't be curious.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.225
We should talk about the case.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.977
He's punishing us for wasting time.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.645
Maybe we shouldn't
be wasting this time.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.772
Close that door.
You're going to get us all fired.

17:43.897 --> 17:47.568
We need to find a link
between fainting and trouble swallowing.

17:47.693 --> 17:50.821
We need to know if it's dysphagia
or full-blown achalasia.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.156
Paraganglioma.

17:52.281 --> 17:54.950
How would a nee-plastic growth
in his abdomen explain...

17:55.075 --> 17:56.452
Not his abdomen.
In his neck.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.746
A carotid body tumor
causes trouble swallowing.

17:58.871 --> 18:02.166
Food presses against the vagus nerve
and causes the fainting.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.085
So, if this guy has cancer,
we get to keep our jobs.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.253
If he's healthy,
we're fired.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.504
We need a CT to prove it.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.590
BRENNAN: And we need the women not to
figure it out while we're sitting here.

18:09.715 --> 18:13.969
And does House's computer
have a built-in microphone?

18:18.807 --> 18:20.392
(SIGHING)

18:39.828 --> 18:43.916
There is a potential toxicity
with an experimental treatment.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.417
I was never here.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.549
Blood pressure is remaining stable
through 60 degrees.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.302
No pauses on his EKG, no nausea.

18:55.427 --> 18:56.970
Our treatment worked.

18:57.095 --> 18:57.930
I need our patient.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.848
Syncope's cured, Amber.
It's over.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.937
You obviously haven't stressed
his system hard enough.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.647
<i>(LAUGHING)
You crank it up high enough,</i>

19:06.772 --> 19:07.856
anyone will pass out.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.734
This is incredible!

19:10.859 --> 19:13.070
This is the most
I've moved in 20 years.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.780
<i>(LAUGHING)</i>

19:16.114 --> 19:18.116
The tilt table test
showed that the patient's EKG,

19:18.242 --> 19:19.785
BP and pulse
remained normal, despite...

19:19.910 --> 19:21.662
Who are you, Thirteen?

19:21.787 --> 19:23.497
My name's in the file.

19:23.622 --> 19:25.123
The fact that you won't
answer my questions

19:25.249 --> 19:26.875
tells me more about you
than answers could.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.001
No, it doesn't.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.044
We turned the thing up
to 95 degrees...

19:29.169 --> 19:31.421
You don't think that non-answers
tell me anything?

19:31.547 --> 19:33.423
Sure. Just not as much
as actual answers.

19:33.549 --> 19:34.675
That's why they're called answers.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.926
They tell me
you're hiding something.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.052
Tells you
I'm hiding everything.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.804
Tells me you've got something
worth hiding.

19:38.929 --> 19:41.181
Was it Turkish prison?
Gay porn?

19:41.306 --> 19:43.517
You killed a man just 'cause he was
asking too many questions?

19:43.642 --> 19:45.018
Can I finish reporting on the patient?

19:45.143 --> 19:46.144
No need.

19:46.270 --> 19:49.773
See you in an hour or so.
Got to set some stuff up.

19:53.735 --> 19:58.407
Thank you all for coming
to tribal council.

20:00.075 --> 20:03.453
A man of your integrity,
I feel I can trust, Big Love.

20:03.579 --> 20:06.832
And I don't call you that
'cause you're a Mormon.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.625
Where's your team's sixth man?

20:08.750 --> 20:10.544
She went rogue.
Broke the rules.

20:10.669 --> 20:13.380
You also sinned. You have no right
to cast the first stone.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.215
And atheists have no right
to quote scripture.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.717
The rules said, "No talking."

20:16.842 --> 20:17.801
I told them not to talk.

20:17.926 --> 20:18.760
Out loud.

20:18.886 --> 20:20.554
We were trying to save a man's life.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.306
Key word being "trying".

20:22.431 --> 20:25.225
Tilt table test confirmed
that you guys were wrong.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.353
You're fired.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.190
The prodigal son returneth.

20:32.316 --> 20:33.400
You're also fired.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.986
We thought there was a tumor
on the patient's esophagus.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.614
We were right about the area,
wrong about the diagnosis.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.783
Turns out the esophagus
is just straightening. It's scleroderma.

20:41.909 --> 20:43.493
Explains the syncope
and the choking.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.453
He needs steroids.

20:44.578 --> 20:45.787
THIRTEEN: You did a CT scan?

20:45.913 --> 20:48.415
- Obviously.
- After you were already proven wrong?

20:48.540 --> 20:50.083
Good for you.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.461
It's too bad you're wrong.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.838
Straightening indicates weakening,
not hardening.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.132
SMA explains
the weakening.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.093
Strongyloides infection
explains everything else.

21:00.218 --> 21:03.555
You ladies have the honor
to give the patient a feeding tube.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.766
Discharge him.
Show up for work tomorrow.

21:05.891 --> 21:09.770
The rest of you...
You're a disappointment.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.397
You make me
want to stop dangling.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.992
It was the best
two weeks of my life.

21:24.117 --> 21:28.246
I think I will miss you most of all,
Ridiculously Old Fraud.

21:37.673 --> 21:38.924
Do you think
House could be wrong?

21:39.091 --> 21:40.175
I thought he fired you.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.343
No. He fired the men.

21:47.641 --> 21:48.809
I don't think he's wrong.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.227
If he is,
how would I prove it?

21:50.352 --> 21:51.812
I just said
I don't think he is.

21:51.937 --> 21:54.606
Well, thinking
isn't good enough.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.567
You have to run a blood test
for anticentromere antibodies.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.236
Would you mind
running the labs?

21:59.361 --> 22:00.195
You can't.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.154
Well, I can, but...

22:01.279 --> 22:03.407
No, I was making a statement.

22:03.532 --> 22:04.574
You've been fired.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.201
So, you no longer
have lab privileges.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.244
You weren't
coming here for advice.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.080
You were coming here
to con a favor to save your job.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.374
Sorry. I'm not working
for him anymore,

22:12.499 --> 22:14.793
but he can still
make my life miserable.

22:16.795 --> 22:19.006
And you have a chance
to make his life miserable.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.219
I'm insulted.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.055
You conned Cameron by
appealing to her humanity...

22:27.180 --> 22:28.557
I told her what
she wanted to hear.

22:28.682 --> 22:30.475
And you told me
what you thought I wanted to hear.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.187
If it's any consolation, I think
your motives are more interesting.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.941
I cannot believe
he fired you.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.402
Go draw his blood.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.320
I'll meet you in the lab
when I'm done here.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.747
Guess you didn't find your tumor.

22:51.872 --> 22:54.041
The other doctors tell
you that you were fine?

22:54.166 --> 22:57.836
Yeah, in the sense it's just
my disease getting worse.

23:01.048 --> 23:03.925
You come to terms
with this disease.

23:05.010 --> 23:08.722
You know it's there.
You know it's waiting.

23:08.847 --> 23:12.059
And every now and again
it takes something away.

23:14.936 --> 23:18.065
Took my walking.
Took my modesty.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.402
Now, it's taking one
of my last pleasures.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.738
Well, there's an outside shot

23:24.863 --> 23:26.073
that something
other than the SMA

23:26.198 --> 23:27.949
is causing your
eating problems.

23:28.075 --> 23:31.369
And if it is, we can fix it,
remove that tube.

23:39.544 --> 23:42.005
Is that my blood?
It's green.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.175
What does that mean?

23:50.055 --> 23:52.015
It means I'm not fired.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.727
Is he a Vulcan?

23:56.728 --> 23:59.356
If no, what makes
Nimoy bleed green?

23:59.481 --> 24:00.690
Are we officially un-fired?

24:00.816 --> 24:02.776
How do we know she didn't fake
the green blood?

24:02.901 --> 24:04.319
'Cause that would be stupid.

24:04.444 --> 24:08.031
And while she may be manipulative,
borderline evil, shallow...

24:08.156 --> 24:10.158
They get it.
I'm not stupid.

24:10.283 --> 24:11.993
What contrast did
you use for the CT?

24:12.119 --> 24:13.870
- ICM.
- His kidneys aren't working.

24:13.995 --> 24:17.541
They didn't filter the contrast,
which, in ICM, is green.

24:19.000 --> 24:19.918
Ten points.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.712
Okay, let's add kidney failure
to our list of symptoms.

24:22.838 --> 24:25.215
What are these points?
Is that how you're deciding who to fire?

24:25.340 --> 24:27.759
I'm going to fire the next person
who asks me who I'm going to fire.

24:27.884 --> 24:28.927
Now we're on
the point system?

24:29.052 --> 24:30.053
What happened to
men against women?

24:30.178 --> 24:31.012
Forget the game.

24:31.138 --> 24:32.055
What do you mean,
forget the game?

24:32.180 --> 24:34.141
I mean,
forget the damn game!

24:34.266 --> 24:36.810
This guy's kidneys are failing.
We need to diagnose exactly...

24:36.935 --> 24:38.145
I thought
we were diagnosing.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.647
You were diagnosing.
Now, I am, too.

24:40.772 --> 24:43.859
I thought that Thirteen was right
about the strongyloides.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.193
I was obviously wrong.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.114
Okay, kidney failure,
aspiration, fainting. Go.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.950
Kidney failure could be the result
of a gram negative bacteria.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.743
Our patient wears
a catheter full-time.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.871
It virtually guarantees
bacterial infection.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.373
Which could have
migrated up to his kidneys.

24:58.498 --> 25:02.294
Infection stresses his already
weakened system, makes his SMA worse.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.045
That explains
the choking and fainting.

25:04.171 --> 25:05.589
Put him on an IV amp and gent.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.841
AMBER: Our team's
scleroderma diagnosis still holds.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.342
The test could have
been negative because

25:09.467 --> 25:10.802
the blood was tainted
with the contrast.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.179
Do a skin biopsy.

25:12.304 --> 25:14.181
Get a side of lymph node
to confirm.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.398
HOUSE: I could
have you fired.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.150
You already had me fired.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.276
Just proves that I can.

25:26.401 --> 25:27.652
Were the men wrong?

25:27.777 --> 25:28.820
No.

25:28.945 --> 25:30.405
- That doesn't change the fact...
- Why are you yelling at me?

25:30.530 --> 25:32.073
Because performing
tests for someone

25:32.199 --> 25:33.575
who is not a doctor
in this hospital...

25:33.700 --> 25:35.702
You're frustrated.
You want help, I'm here.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.788
If you just need to vent,
leave a message.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.336
I like him better like this.
You?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.131
Patient developed pneumonia.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.466
His lungs are filling fast.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.967
We started him on antibiotics.

25:51.092 --> 25:52.302
Nothing. We were wrong.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.386
And you're here to say?

25:53.511 --> 25:55.472
We were wrong, too.
He doesn't have scleroderma.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.599
Biopsy revealed
no fibrotic changes.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.601
Cervical lymph node
has black flecks.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.645
Just small areas of necrosis.
It's nothing.

26:01.770 --> 26:04.147
You say, "Nothing,"
I say, "Cancer."

26:04.272 --> 26:06.191
It's a bit of a stretch
to jump right to cancer.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.027
I'm not jumping. Broad specs
haven't worked, so ifs not bacterial.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.780
Failing liver despite treatment
suggests it's not fungal.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.740
And her high lactic acidosis
points towards

26:13.865 --> 26:15.784
anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

26:15.909 --> 26:19.579
Also suggests infection, which is
a lot easier and safer to treat.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.581
Large cell lymphoma
is incredibly aggressive.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.667
She'll be dead in a week
if we follow the textbooks.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.710
Unless it's infection,
in which case you irradiate her,

26:25.835 --> 26:27.545
and she'll be
dead in a day.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.506
And I know you have
some experience with that.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.718
I've seen
doctors do this before.

26:33.843 --> 26:34.886
Go back to
the scene of the crime,

26:35.011 --> 26:37.514
if you're right this time,
you purge yourself of past ghosts.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.557
I know
it's contrary to protocol.

26:39.683 --> 26:40.558
But I think
it's more likely...

26:40.684 --> 26:43.478
Ghosts are
there for a reason.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.313
So you don't make
the same mistake twice.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.276
Switch her over
to third-generation cephalosporin.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.534
You want to remove his eye?

26:57.659 --> 26:58.618
Who told you?

26:58.743 --> 27:00.161
You booked the OR.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.413
Good.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.416
You can't beat
me in a foot race.

27:04.541 --> 27:07.002
I thought we were dancing.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.755
Cervical lymph node
is a garbage dump.

27:10.880 --> 27:11.881
A very small one.

27:12.007 --> 27:14.134
Just one truck comes
and it only comes from one home.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.885
Al Gore would be appalled.
The home...

27:16.011 --> 27:18.179
The home is the right eye.
I get it.

27:18.722 --> 27:20.140
Do a biopsy.

27:20.265 --> 27:21.641
On my Way-

27:22.100 --> 27:23.810
You're not
doing a biopsy.

27:23.935 --> 27:25.270
You ordered
an orbital exenteration.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.439
Right. Because I don't want to
remove a little, tiny piece,

27:27.564 --> 27:29.190
sit in the lab and confirm
what I already know,

27:29.316 --> 27:31.234
while my patient drowns
in his own fluid.

27:31.359 --> 27:34.321
But if you want me to,
I absolutely will.

27:34.446 --> 27:35.905
How advanced
is the pneumonia?

27:36.031 --> 27:38.158
It's taking
college courses.

27:38.616 --> 27:39.743
Hey, Wilson!

27:39.868 --> 27:41.578
I'm going to cut
some cripple's eye out!

27:41.703 --> 27:43.747
Want to come watch?

27:45.123 --> 27:46.458
Good times.

27:46.583 --> 27:47.959
We good to go?

27:58.219 --> 28:00.805
I thought melanoma
was skin cancer.

28:01.514 --> 28:04.267
Technically, it's cancer
of the pigment cells.

28:04.392 --> 28:07.437
The same cells that
give your iris its color.

28:07.562 --> 28:08.980
Cancer?

28:09.898 --> 28:12.442
Why not? What else
can God throw at me?

28:12.567 --> 28:16.196
Hail, locusts,
smiting of the first born...

28:16.321 --> 28:18.114
All depends on
how evil you've been.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.824
House.

28:19.949 --> 28:22.619
If it's cancer,
it's spread everywhere, right?

28:23.953 --> 28:27.040
That's what's in my lungs?
My kidneys?

28:27.165 --> 28:30.502
There is a chance, by removing the eye,
to get the primary tumor,

28:30.627 --> 28:32.253
and three
courses of radiation,

28:32.670 --> 28:33.671
that could...

28:33.797 --> 28:37.675
Could what?
A few months? Years?

28:38.843 --> 28:41.054
More likely months.

28:41.179 --> 28:44.682
Any of your other doctors
have any cheerier diagnoses?

28:44.808 --> 28:46.851
If they do, they're wrong.
This is the answer.

28:46.976 --> 28:48.686
It's the only way
to help you.

28:48.812 --> 28:52.023
I already can't walk.
I can't eat.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.612
You're telling me
that the rest of my life

28:57.737 --> 29:01.408
is in this bed,
puking and pain?

29:01.533 --> 29:03.576
We can manage the pain.

29:03.701 --> 29:06.538
I'd rather just
get this over with.

29:07.705 --> 29:13.169
I've been trapped
in this useless body long enough.

29:15.130 --> 29:18.258
It'd be nice
to finally get out.

29:20.135 --> 29:21.428
Get out and go where?

29:21.553 --> 29:22.929
I mean, you think
you're going to sprout wings

29:23.054 --> 29:24.681
and start flying around
with the other angels?

29:24.806 --> 29:27.559
Don't be an idiot.
There is no "after". There's just this.

29:27.684 --> 29:29.018
House!

29:40.321 --> 29:43.158
You can't let a dying man
take solace in his beliefs?

29:43.283 --> 29:44.451
His beliefs are stupid.

29:44.576 --> 29:45.743
Everybody lies.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.328
Some for good reasons,
some for bad.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.122
This would have been
a fantastic reason to lie.

29:49.247 --> 29:50.874
Hi. Greg House.

29:50.999 --> 29:54.002
Why can't you just let him
have his fairy tale?

29:54.127 --> 29:55.962
If it gives him comfort
to imagine beaches

29:56.087 --> 29:58.381
and loved ones
and life outside a wheelchair...

29:58.506 --> 30:00.216
Are there <i>72</i> virgins, too?

30:00.341 --> 30:01.176
It's over.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.595
He's got days,
maybe hours left.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.514
What pain does it cause you if he spends
that time with a peaceful smile?

30:06.639 --> 30:08.224
What sick pleasure
do you get in making

30:08.349 --> 30:10.310
damn sure he's filled
with fear and dread?

30:10.435 --> 30:13.480
He shouldn't be making
a decision based on a lie.

30:13.605 --> 30:14.731
Misery is
better than nothing.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.941
You don't know there's nothing.
You haven't been there.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.360
Oh, God,
I am tired of that argument.

30:19.486 --> 30:21.738
I don't have to go to Detroit
to know that it smells.

30:21.863 --> 30:25.783
Yes. Detroit,
the afterlife, same thing.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.464
AMBER: You're not
getting enough oxygen,

32:03.590 --> 32:05.842
so we're inserting a tube
directly into your lungs.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.011
It should help us drain
some of this excess fluid.

32:08.136 --> 32:10.388
Should make you
a little more comfortable.

32:10.513 --> 32:11.472
(GROANING)

32:15.685 --> 32:18.062
AMBER: SATs are
still dropping.

32:18.187 --> 32:19.397
THIRTEEN: The fluid's clear.

32:19.522 --> 32:22.442
If this was cancer,
there should be blood.

32:22.567 --> 32:23.568
Call House.

32:23.693 --> 32:25.028
(RINGING)

32:25.153 --> 32:26.779
He just paged me.

32:34.579 --> 32:35.788
Dr. House!

32:50.219 --> 32:51.554
Maybe it was

32:52.221 --> 32:53.598
just an accident.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.433
It wasn't an accident.

32:55.558 --> 32:58.186
Think his nihilism got the best of him
and he tried to kill himself?

32:58.311 --> 32:59.937
- He paged me.
- He paged you?

33:00.063 --> 33:01.648
- Why you?
- I assume because...

33:01.773 --> 33:03.900
WILSON:
Don't assume anything.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.277
Don't fall into that trap.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.528
Is he okay?

33:09.238 --> 33:10.448
Burned his hand pretty good.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.492
His heart stopped
for nearly a minute.

33:12.617 --> 33:15.411
But your cohort
managed to restart it.

33:15.536 --> 33:19.207
But he has not
regained consciousness.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.920
So, since I
have you all here,

33:24.045 --> 33:26.464
we should probably talk
about your actual patient.

33:26.589 --> 33:29.425
Clear fluid from the lungs
indicates that it's probably not cancer.

33:29.550 --> 33:33.680
So it would be nice if we could
come up with a new idea.

33:42.605 --> 33:45.149
You're an idiot.
You nearly killed yourself.

33:45.274 --> 33:46.401
That was the whole idea.

33:46.526 --> 33:47.402
You wanted to kill yourself?

33:47.527 --> 33:49.737
I wanted to
nearly kill myself.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.447
Is he better?

33:51.572 --> 33:53.491
No.
But he doesn't have cancer.

33:53.616 --> 33:55.368
We think it might be
eosinophilic pneumonia.

33:55.493 --> 33:58.371
Maybe you didn't want to die,
but you didn't care if you lived.

33:58.496 --> 34:01.082
You insisted that I needed
to see for myself.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.043
Was he discharged?

34:04.168 --> 34:05.253
No. He's dying.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.673
You've already had
two near-death experiences.

34:08.798 --> 34:12.343
Not that guy,
the guy in the car accident.

34:12.468 --> 34:14.053
With the knife.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.640
I need to talk to him.

34:17.765 --> 34:19.642
He died almost an hour ago.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.104
Apparently, it's bad
to electrocute yourself

34:23.229 --> 34:26.774
within days of suffering
massive internal injuries.

34:27.984 --> 34:30.528
Why did you need
to talk to him?

34:30.653 --> 34:33.281
Did you see something?

34:33.531 --> 34:35.408
Eosinophilic pneumonia.

34:35.533 --> 34:37.660
House? What did you see?

34:37.785 --> 34:39.078
Nothing.

34:39.203 --> 34:40.747
Whose idea was that?

34:40.872 --> 34:41.706
Brennan.

34:41.831 --> 34:44.709
"Nothing," you don't want
to talk about it, or, "Nothing..."

34:44.834 --> 34:45.835
Which one's Brennan?

34:45.960 --> 34:47.962
Is he the ridiculously
old guy?

34:48.087 --> 34:49.881
House, you've got
to talk about this.

34:50.006 --> 34:54.218
If it's aggressive enough
it might have gotten past the steroids.

34:54.761 --> 34:56.512
Start him
on cyclophosphamide.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.014
I already did.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.766
Just looking at you hurts.

35:00.933 --> 35:04.103
I'm gonna order up
some extra pain meds.

35:04.228 --> 35:05.605
I love you.

35:08.024 --> 35:09.817
(STARK WHEEZING)

35:10.443 --> 35:13.696
How fast will this work?

35:13.821 --> 35:16.407
New meds should start helping
in minutes, okay? Hang in there.

35:16.532 --> 35:19.327
Vacutainer's full.
I need to replace it.

35:19.452 --> 35:23.956
I don't think it's working.

35:24.081 --> 35:25.500
Try and relax.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.460
(GASPING)

35:28.085 --> 35:30.129
You must be wrong.

35:30.254 --> 35:31.130
Stop talking.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.842
Hurry up and get
the chest tube working.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.427
Okay. I got it.

35:36.552 --> 35:39.847
Can you get Hoover?

35:42.892 --> 35:44.602
(GASPING)

36:00.701 --> 36:02.203
I can't...

36:02.328 --> 36:05.373
Can you put m)!

36:06.457 --> 36:07.333
Hand

36:08.960 --> 36:10.211
on his head?

36:15.299 --> 36:18.010
It's okay. Don't worry.

36:20.304 --> 36:22.223
I'm not scared.

36:27.854 --> 36:29.605
(GASPING)

36:34.485 --> 36:36.821
(FLATLINING)

36:37.446 --> 36:38.573
Oh, God.

36:41.742 --> 36:44.537
(WHIMPERING)

36:51.294 --> 36:52.920
Time of death...

37:03.347 --> 37:05.516
You're looking better.

37:06.767 --> 37:07.894
Stark's dead.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.860
What are you doing?

37:16.027 --> 37:17.612
Going to see our patient.

37:18.154 --> 37:19.155
He's dead.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.324
"Dead" is not a diagnosis.

37:21.449 --> 37:24.201
- You really shouldn't be...
- Shut up and give me my cane.

37:27.038 --> 37:28.539
I assume we're all fired.

37:28.664 --> 37:30.458
Should I fire myself, too?

37:31.417 --> 37:34.253
I thought it was strongyloides,
then I thought it was cancer.

37:34.378 --> 37:37.548
- A little help, here?
- Ready? One, two...

37:43.262 --> 37:45.723
Why did you call me?

37:45.848 --> 37:47.516
Because if I pooped myself
in front of Wilson,

37:47.642 --> 37:48.643
I'd never hear the end of it.

37:48.768 --> 37:50.394
But why not one
of the others?

37:50.519 --> 37:51.812
You always have that phone
in your hand.

37:51.938 --> 37:54.482
We all have cell phones,
that's not the reason. What is?

37:54.607 --> 37:57.068
If I died,
you'd never get the job.

37:57.193 --> 37:58.861
I knew you wouldn't
let that happen.

37:58.986 --> 38:01.280
You don't think anybody else
has any reason to care?

38:01.405 --> 38:02.907
I think this is starting
to come back to me.

38:03.032 --> 38:05.618
It's right, left,
then repeat.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.329
Yeah. That works.

38:11.707 --> 38:12.583
What did we miss?

38:12.708 --> 38:14.710
If we knew,
he wouldn't be dead.

38:14.835 --> 38:16.504
So, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

38:16.629 --> 38:19.215
No. We were defeated.
It's over.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.593
Patient presented with syncope.

38:22.718 --> 38:25.137
We thought it was thread worms,
gave him invermectin.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.264
Thank you.

38:27.390 --> 38:31.310
The patient seemed better
until his blood turned green.

38:31.435 --> 38:32.937
Can we at least
remove the body before

38:33.062 --> 38:35.523
launching into a purely
academic exercise?

38:35.648 --> 38:38.609
The patient didn't respond
to antibiotics or steroids.

38:38.734 --> 38:39.735
You okay, boy?

38:39.860 --> 38:41.821
What's wrong with the dog?

38:50.663 --> 38:51.914
He's dead.

38:52.039 --> 38:53.791
There are only
a handful of viruses

38:53.916 --> 38:56.085
that can cross
between dogs and humans.

38:56.210 --> 38:58.087
But they may not
be connected at all.

38:58.212 --> 38:59.964
The dog was old.
I've seen it before.

39:00.089 --> 39:02.299
They hang on way past
their normal life expectancy

39:02.425 --> 39:03.592
to take care
of their masters.

39:03.718 --> 39:06.804
Did you watch
him take the pills?

39:08.305 --> 39:10.224
The invermectin.
Did you watch the patient

39:10.349 --> 39:12.476
put them in his mouth
and swallow them?

39:12.601 --> 39:14.103
I don't know. I think so.

39:14.228 --> 39:15.146
What kind of dog is that?

39:15.271 --> 39:16.188
English Shepherd.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.524
- That's in the collie family, right?
- Not really.

39:18.649 --> 39:21.068
- But they share the MDR-1 gene?
- Yeah.

39:21.193 --> 39:25.239
What happens when you give a dog
with the MDR-1 gene ivermectin?

39:25.364 --> 39:26.198
They don't.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.576
I mean, it's used to treat
heartworms in most dogs,

39:28.701 --> 39:31.328
but it would be
fatal if they...

39:38.919 --> 39:40.546
Look familiar?

39:41.297 --> 39:42.506
I think the last
time you saw it,

39:42.631 --> 39:45.176
it didn't have
that dead dog's teeth marks on it.

39:45.301 --> 39:47.386
I just put it on the bed tray
to get him some water.

39:47.511 --> 39:50.514
When I asked you if you watched
the patient swallow the pills,

39:50.639 --> 39:52.516
the right answer was, "No."

39:55.394 --> 39:58.064
Take his body
down to the morgue.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.909
(DOOR OPENS)

40:11.118 --> 40:14.080
If you hadn't treated this patient
as a game, he wouldn't be dead.

40:14.205 --> 40:16.040
Feeling much better,
thank you.

40:16.165 --> 40:18.918
I'm supposed to
show you sympathy?

40:19.418 --> 40:22.963
He died while his attending
was lying on a hospital bed

40:23.089 --> 40:25.758
because he stuck
a knife in a wall socket.

40:25.883 --> 40:28.928
He died because
a doctor made a mistake.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.137
She was an idiot.

40:30.262 --> 40:31.180
You employed her.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.725
You're responsible.

40:47.196 --> 40:48.823
Dr. Foreman.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.577
How's she doing?

40:53.702 --> 40:57.665
Fever's gone. AST and ALT are back
within normal range.

40:57.957 --> 41:00.584
She should be out
of here in a few days.

41:00.709 --> 41:01.919
Gutsy call.

41:02.044 --> 41:04.004
- Thanks.
- It wasn't a compliment.

41:05.297 --> 41:06.882
If you were wrong,
she'd be dead.

41:07.007 --> 41:09.718
- I was sure...
- No, you weren't. You couldn't be.

41:09.844 --> 41:11.137
There's a reason
we have rules.

41:11.262 --> 41:13.597
If every doctor did whatever
his gut told him was right,

41:13.722 --> 41:16.892
we'd have a lot more dead bodies
to deal with.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.561
It won't happen again.

41:18.686 --> 41:20.020
Yes, it will.

41:20.146 --> 41:23.357
Because you confuse saving her life
with doing the right thing.

41:25.401 --> 41:27.319
I'm sorry, Dr. Foreman,
you're fired.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.384
As soon as the pathologist
cut into the lungs,

41:50.509 --> 41:52.344
we saw the threadworms.

41:55.806 --> 41:57.349
Do you think it's
fair that I fired

41:57.474 --> 41:58.767
all the other members
of your team

41:58.893 --> 42:01.896
when you guys actually came up
with the right diagnosis?

42:03.647 --> 42:06.525
I keep replaying it
in my mind.

42:06.650 --> 42:09.403
Did I drop the pills
when I put them on the bed tray?

42:09.528 --> 42:12.656
Did I knock them over
when I turned to leave?

42:15.075 --> 42:17.119
You know, he'd be alive.

42:18.662 --> 42:20.080
His dog would be alive.

42:20.206 --> 42:21.248
I know.

42:22.625 --> 42:25.252
You forced us to act
on a false assumption.

42:25.377 --> 42:26.921
- I know.
- Everything we built

42:27.046 --> 42:29.131
from that step on,

42:29.256 --> 42:31.467
every test, every theory,
every treatment...

42:31.592 --> 42:34.678
I know. Forget the lecture
and fire me already.

42:37.056 --> 42:40.309
If I was gonna fire you,
I wouldn't be giving you the lecture.

42:44.104 --> 42:48.317
I know you're not gonna let
anything like this ever happen again.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.406
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:05.626 --> 43:07.503
I'm sorry to say,

43:09.004 --> 43:10.422
I told you so.
