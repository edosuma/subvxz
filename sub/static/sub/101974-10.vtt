WEBVTT

00:02.561 --> 00:04.670
CAPSHAW:
I'm 1.5 centimeters
from the LAD.

00:04.821 --> 00:07.172
Entering aneurysm now.

00:07.399 --> 00:09.842
Extracting intracavitary

00:09.993 --> 00:12.069
thrombus.

00:12.087 --> 00:13.161
Got it.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.238
MARTIN:
Well done.

00:14.331 --> 00:16.640
Beautiful work, Doctor.

00:19.762 --> 00:21.261
And now a purse-string suture?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.171
CAPSHAW:
And endocardial patch.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.083
And then, a celebratory drink.

00:26.101 --> 00:27.526
I think...

00:27.753 --> 00:28.527
Scotch.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.029
You know,
there are only one or two

00:30.180 --> 00:32.256
doctors in the world capable

00:32.274 --> 00:34.608
of what you're doing right now.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.868
Stop buttering me up.

00:36.095 --> 00:38.037
I'm lucky to have
a partner like you.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.688
No, I deserve no credit.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.599
This is all you, Vivian.

00:42.692 --> 00:44.877
You are brilliant.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.963
And anyone who can't see that
is a fool.

00:49.625 --> 00:50.865
Really?

00:50.959 --> 00:52.384
-Brilliant.
-(echoes): I'm brilliant?

00:52.536 --> 00:55.370
MARTIN:
And you know it, too.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.281
This is your destiny, Doctor.

00:57.299 --> 01:00.617
You... finding me here.

01:00.710 --> 01:02.210
This was supposed to happen.

01:02.304 --> 01:03.228
(monitor beeping rapidly)

01:03.380 --> 01:04.879
This was supposed to happen.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.232
This was supposed
to happen.

01:10.813 --> 01:12.905
(monitor flatlines)

01:13.056 --> 01:15.315
(gasps)

01:15.409 --> 01:18.452
What the hell is
the matter with me?

01:20.564 --> 01:22.664
♪ ♪

01:33.928 --> 01:35.076
Morning, Mother.

01:35.170 --> 01:36.670
(gasps) Malcolm!

01:36.822 --> 01:38.488
What are you doing here?

01:38.582 --> 01:40.415
In my loft?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.675
Where I live?

01:41.827 --> 01:42.843
I thought you were sleeping.

01:42.995 --> 01:43.918
I didn't hear you scream.

01:43.938 --> 01:44.995
(sighs)

01:45.013 --> 01:47.064
I don't always wake up
screaming.

01:47.924 --> 01:48.999
Don't you?

01:49.092 --> 01:50.000
What are you doing here

01:50.093 --> 01:51.110
and what is all this?

01:51.261 --> 01:53.278
Oh, I was just...

01:53.430 --> 01:55.430
fetching some things
from the Never Ever Room.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.506
Help me.

01:56.525 --> 01:58.342
(chuckles)
I thought the whole point

01:58.360 --> 02:00.177
of the Never Ever Room was

02:00.195 --> 02:03.104
to shut away Dad's belongings so
you never had to see them again.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.790
Well, it was.

02:05.017 --> 02:07.942
But once I committed
to do that book,

02:08.036 --> 02:09.944
I'm gonna do it right.

02:09.964 --> 02:13.465
Even if that means
some PTSD memory orgy.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.783
Well, it's funny.

02:15.878 --> 02:17.803
You are dredging up the past

02:18.030 --> 02:21.047
while I'm ignoring
The Surgeon altogether.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.308
Hallelujah.

02:23.535 --> 02:26.645
No wonder you look so rested.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.464
Well, I can't say going
cold turkey has been

02:29.558 --> 02:30.798
a pleasant experience.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.226
He's been calling... nonstop.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.212
Darling, you need a reframe.

02:35.230 --> 02:38.732
Your father is not an addiction.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.903
You are not cutting out
nicotine or, God forbid, benzos.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.572
You are cutting out

02:45.666 --> 02:47.624
a malignant tumor.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.076
-Got it.
-Aw!

02:50.229 --> 02:52.171
This is a good thing.

02:52.322 --> 02:54.731
You are freeing yourself
to move on

02:54.824 --> 02:56.750
with your life, finally give up

02:56.902 --> 02:58.635
all this murder nonsense.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.421
Ah, okay.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.739
A mother can dream.

03:02.832 --> 03:05.833
But maybe you will have time

03:05.853 --> 03:08.503
for some lucky girl out there.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.263
I know you and...

03:10.416 --> 03:12.524
Detective Powell have been...

03:12.634 --> 03:13.859
close?

03:14.010 --> 03:15.843
Less so these days.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.421
That whole
"covering up a murder" thing

03:17.439 --> 03:19.256
has been a bit of a roadblock.

03:19.274 --> 03:21.033
Oh.

03:23.946 --> 03:25.037
(exhales)

03:25.188 --> 03:26.096
Mother?

03:26.114 --> 03:27.539
You have that look on your face.

03:27.766 --> 03:28.856
What is it?

03:28.951 --> 03:30.792
It's a bank key.

03:32.195 --> 03:35.464
But your father never handled
any of our accounts.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.426
Well, why did he have it then?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.128
I intend to find out.

03:42.281 --> 03:44.614
(phone vibrating)

03:44.633 --> 03:47.226
Oh, great. Detective Mom.

03:50.714 --> 03:53.649
<i> (line ringing)</i>

03:57.129 --> 03:58.386
Oh, I'm gonna be free.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.404
I have a Bible study

03:59.631 --> 04:02.132
<i> for the faithful</i>
<i> who are interested</i>

04:02.150 --> 04:03.742
<i> in Exodus.</i>

04:03.893 --> 04:04.968
Exodus.

04:05.061 --> 04:05.986
(line rings)

04:06.080 --> 04:07.304
(dial tone)

04:07.397 --> 04:09.155
-Oh, not again.
-(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

04:09.308 --> 04:11.416
Mr. David, I am guaranteed time

04:11.643 --> 04:13.827
with a working phone--
now this one is clearly broken.

04:13.979 --> 04:15.479
I've called my son
countless times.

04:15.497 --> 04:17.147
-None of them have gone through.
-Phone's working

04:17.165 --> 04:19.240
just fine, Martin.
He's not picking up on you.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.501
Well, then let's, uh,
send him a text.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.429
That might be more amenable
to his generation anyhow.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.448
I'll-I'll dictate
and you type and...

04:26.508 --> 04:28.008
Come now, Mr. David.
I need, I need

04:28.160 --> 04:30.176
to reach my son today.
It's urgent.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.436
No, it's urgent you get
to the rec room.

04:31.663 --> 04:34.164
Phone time is over
and you have a busy day.

04:34.257 --> 04:35.274
You don't even know the half.

04:35.425 --> 04:36.758
Better get a move on.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.528
And in the meantime, you'll,
uh, you'll text my son?

04:42.174 --> 04:44.491
I guess not.

04:45.677 --> 04:49.103
Darryl getting out
complicates Exodus.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.014
We need to go today.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.440
I told Martin.

04:52.534 --> 04:53.700
He said no.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.443
Has to be tomorrow.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.369
Why?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.963
Malcolm.

04:59.115 --> 05:00.540
He's got to talk to him.

05:00.692 --> 05:02.042
Give him some...

05:02.194 --> 05:04.511
message before we escape.

05:05.380 --> 05:08.181
Guy's passionate about family.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.977
Brother Martin has
many passions.

05:13.296 --> 05:14.629
Fine.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.706
We go tomorrow.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.026
With or without him.

05:19.895 --> 05:21.394
You just gonna ignore Willie?

05:21.547 --> 05:23.822
Huh? Oh, nice to see you,
too, Willie.

05:23.973 --> 05:27.492
Must've been good to have
company in solitary, right?

05:27.644 --> 05:28.810
Yeah.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.220
But I'm out now?

05:30.238 --> 05:33.390
Soon as I clear you to return.

05:33.408 --> 05:35.392
Hey, relax.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.169
You'll be back
with your friends in no time.

05:37.396 --> 05:39.654
They're not my friends.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.656
(monitor beeping)

05:41.675 --> 05:42.916
CAPSHAW:
No?

05:43.068 --> 05:45.344
Why not?

05:45.495 --> 05:47.179
They cut me out.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.757
Put me in the hole.

05:50.909 --> 05:53.060
Why would they do that?

05:54.096 --> 05:56.146
You can trust me, Darryl.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.193
They don't matter.

06:01.344 --> 06:03.344
It's all about the good doctor.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.680
I want the key cards, Darryl.
Friar Pete!

06:05.699 --> 06:07.682
This heathen has brought
a weapon into the room!

06:07.776 --> 06:10.035
Yo, he's a Judas!
Don't trust him!

06:10.262 --> 06:12.996
He's the true head of the snake.

06:16.435 --> 06:18.860
(indistinct radio chatter)

06:18.954 --> 06:20.712
Wow.

06:20.864 --> 06:22.363
The Coronet's looking good.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.715
Oh, no, you stay away.

06:23.942 --> 06:25.867
I've had to rebuild her twice--
first because of you,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.445
then because of your mother.
No more Whitlys around my car.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.180
How about Tarmels?

06:32.300 --> 06:33.950
Come on.

06:34.043 --> 06:35.560
<i> DANI:</i>
<i> Boys and toys,</i>

06:35.787 --> 06:36.786
I swear.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.455
Thought we were here
to solve a murder?

06:38.548 --> 06:40.624
We are. The victim

06:40.717 --> 06:43.068
is Rosalie Howard.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.317
-Edrisa, what do you got?
-Well, I'll tell you what I got.

06:51.470 --> 06:54.246
Some major Japandi vibes,
that's what.

06:54.397 --> 06:56.139
I mean, look at this place.

06:56.158 --> 06:58.583
Clean lines,
soft minimalism, just a...

06:58.735 --> 07:00.644
hint of rustic texture.

07:00.662 --> 07:02.812
I wonder where she got
that crystal...

07:02.831 --> 07:05.315
GIL:
This one isn't for sale.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.574
It's our murder weapon.

07:06.668 --> 07:08.652
Yes, yes. Right, murder.

07:08.670 --> 07:11.988
Uh, cause of death-- blunt force
trauma to the back of the skull.

07:12.081 --> 07:14.507
Rosalie likely died
after one blow.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.102
But the killer kept
bashing her head in, over

07:17.253 --> 07:18.662
and over and over and over.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.273
Overkill speaks
to an impulse control disorder.

07:21.424 --> 07:25.026
Inability to integrate emotional
reactions with consequences.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.779
Our killer snapped.

07:28.006 --> 07:29.597
DANI: Yeah,
but the struggle didn't start

07:29.691 --> 07:30.932
till they were in here.

07:31.026 --> 07:33.100
I'm guessing Rosalie
knew her killer?

07:33.195 --> 07:35.787
She wasn't yet fully dressed,
but she still let him in.

07:36.014 --> 07:37.530
They didn't just
know each other.

07:37.683 --> 07:39.458
-They were intimate.
-JT: A crime of passion.

07:39.609 --> 07:40.625
Exactly.

07:40.852 --> 07:43.945
And the killer didn't have
time to clean up.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.538
Why?

07:45.691 --> 07:46.948
Maybe he heard sirens?

07:47.075 --> 07:48.858
Or someone else came in,
interrupted him.

07:48.877 --> 07:51.361
Report mentions
an anonymous witness

07:51.379 --> 07:53.472
called the station
from a landline.

07:53.623 --> 07:55.140
Who still has a landline?

07:55.291 --> 07:56.975
-I have a-- Oh!
-Old people.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.126
JT:
Nobody shoot.

07:59.221 --> 08:00.795
I'll run a trace,
find the witness.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.964
BRIGHT:
You don't have to.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.799
There he is.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.543
-GIL: Let's go.
<i> -(knocking)</i>

08:06.561 --> 08:08.695
NYPD. Open up!

08:13.385 --> 08:14.809
Sir, what's going on in there?

08:14.903 --> 08:17.053
<i> MAN:</i>
<i> Go away, please!</i>

08:17.072 --> 08:18.747
He's under duress.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.459
On three, two...

08:26.398 --> 08:27.672
Hello?

08:27.899 --> 08:29.966
Sir?

08:36.575 --> 08:38.850
JT:
Landline's not the only thing
old in this place.

08:39.002 --> 08:41.186
Who lives here?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.565
GIL:
Gerald Morris, you remember him?

08:46.601 --> 08:49.677
Chess grand master,
Gerald Morris.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.681
Yeah, he was a famous world
champion in the '70s and '80s.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.349
Until he disappeared.

08:55.443 --> 08:57.260
Yeah, looks
like he's good at that.

08:57.353 --> 08:58.778
JT:
Maybe he ran away.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.281
These appliances are
30 years old,

09:01.375 --> 09:03.375
at least.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.435
He may be agoraphobic.

09:05.453 --> 09:07.361
He's afraid to leave the house.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.714
It's more than that. Agoraphobia

09:09.866 --> 09:11.699
is a crippling anxiety disorder.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.368
So Gerald isn't under duress.

09:14.462 --> 09:16.446
And we need a warrant
to be in here.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.265
Exactly.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.967
Okay.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.062
Let's move out, folks.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.126
(door closes)

09:30.145 --> 09:32.195
(stairs creaking)

09:52.426 --> 09:54.909
(exhales)

09:54.928 --> 09:57.971
Nice digs.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.976
You should not have
come in here.

10:07.165 --> 10:08.014
Who are you?

10:08.183 --> 10:09.999
Why are you in my house?

10:10.093 --> 10:12.335
Malcolm Bright, NYPD.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.020
Adjacent.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.614
I'm not a threat.

10:15.765 --> 10:19.025
We only want to find out
who killed Rosalie Howard.

10:19.177 --> 10:21.435
You're gonna make me leave.

10:21.529 --> 10:23.196
But I won't.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.248
I won't do it. I won't!

10:26.685 --> 10:28.368
You won't shoot me, either.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.037
You don't know that.

10:31.189 --> 10:32.205
Actually, I do.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.948
Antique weapons are
kind of my thing.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.525
And this one won't fire.

10:35.543 --> 10:37.710
The latch is broken,

10:37.863 --> 10:41.431
which means the cylinder
isn't locked.

10:45.537 --> 10:46.719
(stammers softly)

10:46.872 --> 10:48.647
How long have you been in here?

10:50.133 --> 10:53.652
I haven't been outside
since March...

10:54.971 --> 10:56.446
...of '97.

10:57.565 --> 10:59.065
24 years.

10:59.217 --> 11:02.619
Which means you were here
when Rosalie was murdered.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.165
You saw it and called
the police, didn't you?

11:10.319 --> 11:12.078
-Yeah.
-If I promise
you won't have to leave,

11:12.230 --> 11:14.506
will you tell the detectives
what you saw?

11:14.733 --> 11:17.658
I'm...
(grunts)

11:17.678 --> 11:20.095
not too good around people.

11:22.032 --> 11:24.182
Okay. Uh...

11:24.333 --> 11:26.643
How about just
one detective, then?

11:30.098 --> 11:32.732
Mr. Morris,
did you know Rosalie?

11:34.677 --> 11:36.528
No, we never met.

11:36.755 --> 11:38.012
But you watched her.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.347
What else do I have to do?

11:40.442 --> 11:42.516
My entire life is that window.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.537
What happens out there,
it's better than the crap on TV.

11:45.764 --> 11:48.598
Well, n-not that it works.

11:48.616 --> 11:49.615
So, you watch everyone.

11:49.768 --> 11:52.618
I'm no Peeping Tom, okay?

11:52.771 --> 11:54.379
I have a right to look out

11:54.530 --> 11:56.506
-m-my damn window.
-(phone ringing)

11:58.626 --> 12:00.051
Can you turn that off?

12:00.278 --> 12:03.279
Uh-- The noise, it's so sharp.

12:03.298 --> 12:07.058
And you, uh, coaster, please.

12:10.288 --> 12:12.147
-Sorry.
-Don't worry.

12:19.130 --> 12:21.130
I watch people.

12:22.133 --> 12:26.911
Rosalie fell in love
about six months ago.

12:27.063 --> 12:29.063
Tall fellow, brown hair.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.564
Uh, a sharp dresser.

12:30.658 --> 12:33.400
He always came around late.

12:33.495 --> 12:34.978
Uh, too late, if you ask me.
(chuckles)

12:35.071 --> 12:36.662
DANI:
Did Rosalie's boyfriend

12:36.815 --> 12:38.982
-come over last night?
-I heard a commotion

12:39.000 --> 12:40.483
around 11:00.

12:40.502 --> 12:42.427
It was all happening so fast,

12:42.654 --> 12:44.912
I didn't get a clear look
at the man's face,

12:44.931 --> 12:47.156
but he was the same height,
same hair.

12:47.250 --> 12:51.511
He, uh, grabbed her, and the...

12:51.605 --> 12:55.190
Well, you know the rest.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.942
Do you still play chess, Gerald?

12:58.094 --> 13:01.020
I-I don't see
how that's relevant.

13:01.172 --> 13:02.596
He'll bring it around.

13:02.690 --> 13:03.856
You may not compete anymore,

13:04.009 --> 13:06.242
but you still think
like a grand master.

13:07.679 --> 13:10.771
You were famous for learning
your opponents' moves.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.416
Their quirks and patterns.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.795
I bet you do that
with your neighbors, too.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.129
See?

13:20.449 --> 13:21.633
I do.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.953
Uh, memory was always my gift.

13:26.047 --> 13:28.698
I know more about this
neighborhood than anyone.

13:38.301 --> 13:42.529
So if we asked you what kind of
car Rosalie's boyfriend drove...

13:44.974 --> 13:48.243
Um, Porsche. Red.

He graduated Yale
with a 3.49 GPA.

14:51.783 --> 14:53.116
He's rounding up.

14:53.134 --> 14:56.210
So he's guilty of exaggerating,
but is he our guy?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.788

Clayton's an investment banker.

kind of witness would he be?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.406

A brilliant one.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.332
Gerald's a genius.

15:38.587 --> 15:40.830
He can't erase
whatever messed him up.

15:40.848 --> 15:44.016
I know, but we're trying
to build a bulletproof case.

15:44.169 --> 15:45.276
That means reliable witnesses,

15:45.503 --> 15:47.761
not some guy cursed
to never leave his house.

15:47.855 --> 15:49.096
He's not cursed.

15:49.340 --> 15:52.116
Agoraphobia does not make Gerald
an unreliable witness.

22:33.744 --> 22:38.080
And she started bringing me
fresh groceries.

22:38.099 --> 22:40.933
Rosalie helped...

22:41.085 --> 22:43.194
an old grouch,

22:43.421 --> 22:45.529
but I couldn't help her.

22:45.756 --> 22:47.531
Not over there.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.020
Something's wrong.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.042
Someone's inside Rosalie's
apartment, look.

22:58.861 --> 23:00.285
BRIGHT:
You're right.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.171

Pete's onto us.

-It's a disaster.
-No, it's Tuesday.

23:56.251 --> 23:58.084
Pete is a violent psychopath.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.345
Which means he's not the first

24:25.280 --> 24:27.631
Vivian, you've changed my life.

24:27.858 --> 24:30.693
Being a doctor again...

24:30.711 --> 24:34.597
I feel like Picasso
rediscovering rose.

24:35.716 --> 24:38.142
You're my muse.

24:38.369 --> 24:39.960
You've done so much for me.

24:40.054 --> 24:42.295
Please...

24:42.389 --> 24:45.524
let me do this... for you.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.139
(softly):
Okay.

24:53.234 --> 24:54.900
I think you'll like the results.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.144
If last time was any indication,
just imagine what I can do

24:58.164 --> 25:01.073
-without these.
-Tempting.

25:01.225 --> 25:02.833
But I'm not going to unlock you.

25:02.985 --> 25:04.543
(latch clicks, door opens)

25:07.581 --> 25:10.749
Oh. And here I thought
I was the only woman

25:10.901 --> 25:12.510
to grace The Surgeon's cell.

25:12.737 --> 25:14.236
Uh, Dr. Capshaw.

25:15.072 --> 25:18.015
-This is my wife...
-(Jessica clears throat)

25:18.166 --> 25:21.435

25:22.747 --> 25:24.504
Delighted!
(forced chuckle)

25:24.524 --> 25:27.340
I do hope there's
something wrong with him.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.842
No.

25:28.936 --> 25:31.587
No, he's as healthy as a horse.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.656
Not for long.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.943
Leave him in one piece for me,
would you?

Good help is so hard to find
these days.

25:47.362 --> 25:50.272
Jessie,
thrilled as I am by this...

25:50.365 --> 25:54.385
unexpected visit,
I have a very busy day,

25:54.536 --> 25:58.781
-so I have so many calls...
-I don't care, Martin.

25:58.799 --> 26:00.224
(scoffs)

26:02.711 --> 26:05.187
You've got a secret.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.384
Go on, cough it up,

26:11.478 --> 26:14.071
or I will choke
that secret out of you.

26:14.298 --> 26:15.798
Well, that sounds like fun.

26:15.816 --> 26:17.466
(scoffs)

26:17.484 --> 26:20.995
(exhales)
Do you remember this?

26:21.581 --> 26:24.230
Your little key?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.916
Well, perhaps
if you hand it over,

26:26.068 --> 26:29.402
-I could be of more assistance.
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?

26:29.496 --> 26:31.755
What does this key unlock,
Martin?

26:31.907 --> 26:33.999
Is it money?

26:34.151 --> 26:35.575
Murder trophies?

26:35.595 --> 26:37.428
Isn't it obvious?

26:38.322 --> 26:39.263
It's the key to my heart.

26:39.414 --> 26:41.340
-(groans)
-You've had it all along.

26:41.434 --> 26:42.582
Tell me about...

26:42.602 --> 26:45.661
The key, the key!
Who knows what it's to?

26:45.679 --> 26:48.088
I-- that was so,
so many years ago.

26:48.107 --> 26:52.610
I mean, perhaps it,
uh, opens a toy chest, or...

26:52.761 --> 26:55.095
maybe a wardrobe to Narnia.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.022
I can tell when you're lying.

26:57.174 --> 26:58.357
Not historically.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.468
You would not need
to be so vague

27:01.528 --> 27:03.603
if you did not have
something to hide.

27:03.697 --> 27:05.772
Why fish for trouble, Jess?

27:05.791 --> 27:07.958
Life is good! Look at us.

27:08.110 --> 27:09.293
You're...

27:09.444 --> 27:10.535
thriving.

27:10.688 --> 27:11.870
-Mm.
-My Filofax

27:12.022 --> 27:13.964
hasn't been this full in years.

27:14.116 --> 27:15.874
And so is my day--
so I'm afraid

27:15.968 --> 27:19.470
-our little tête-à-tête
will have to wait.
-You're cheery.

27:21.031 --> 27:22.381
What are you up to?

27:22.475 --> 27:23.699

Oh, I don't know.

27:44.054 --> 27:46.071
Something
with that beautiful doctor

27:46.223 --> 27:47.498
you've been working with?

27:47.649 --> 27:49.391
Oh, don't let jealousy cloud
your judgment, Jess.

27:49.410 --> 27:51.818
Now you're just trying
to wind me up.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.170
(whispers):
Tell me what you're up to.

27:53.397 --> 27:55.172
Well, what would be the fun
in that?

<i> MARTIN:</i>
<i> You can crack</i>

28:01.163 --> 28:03.639

28:05.184 --> 28:07.518
There's an emergency
in the infirmary, Martin.

28:07.745 --> 28:08.835
They need you.

28:08.929 --> 28:11.246
Well, what could that be about?

28:11.339 --> 28:12.431
Jessica,

28:12.583 --> 28:15.359
I trust you'll be able
to see yourself out.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.587
-Duty calls.

A twin? Really?

28:23.385 --> 28:25.444
It's the only explanation
for what I saw.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.871

from chronic sleeplessness,

28:28.023 --> 28:29.022
delusions...

28:29.041 --> 28:31.208
How do you know about my delu...

28:31.359 --> 28:32.376
Forget it.

28:32.527 --> 28:34.102
(chuckles)
Thought you said something else.

28:34.121 --> 28:36.029
That's funny.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.441
Looks like Bright
really did see a double.

28:39.460 --> 28:40.792
DEA confirms it.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.704
Clayton Fielder has got
a twin brother named Felix,

28:44.798 --> 28:46.615
a known associate
of the Morelia drug cartel.

28:46.633 --> 28:48.708
-Well, look at that.
-Turns out Clayton fled

28:48.728 --> 28:50.619
the cartel ten years ago,

28:50.637 --> 28:53.564
changed his name, removed
his tattoos, the whole nine.

28:53.715 --> 28:56.049
His brother Felix
has been after him ever since.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.628
So Felix came looking
for Clayton,

28:59.721 --> 29:01.739
found Rosalie instead.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.466
Of course she let him right in.

29:04.559 --> 29:07.411
When she didn't give up Clayton,
he killed her.

29:07.562 --> 29:09.246
Brave girl.

29:09.397 --> 29:11.323
(sighs)
Looks like Clayton is next.

29:11.475 --> 29:13.417
JT, you and Dani find Clayton.

29:13.568 --> 29:16.144
Bright,
I need you back at Gerald's.

29:16.238 --> 29:18.997
-We've got to convince him to...
-Testify against Felix.

29:19.149 --> 29:21.741
Which means
he'll have to leave his house.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.969
If anyone can get through
to this guy, it's you.

29:27.582 --> 29:31.084
(groaning, gagging)

29:31.103 --> 29:33.979
-(grunting)
-Need more help.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.590
Turn him over.

29:38.593 --> 29:40.944
I've never seen
anything like this before.

29:41.171 --> 29:42.687
What the hell happened?

29:42.782 --> 29:44.506
Dysentery, I suspect.

29:44.525 --> 29:47.009
You've seen the conditions
in the cafeteria.

29:47.102 --> 29:49.912
Look around.
This is no accident.

29:50.772 --> 29:53.106
Oh, my God. The boiler room.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.942
What if Friar Pete
was stealing the rat poison?

29:56.036 --> 29:58.128
He could have put it
in the food.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.538
MARTIN:
Anticoagulants?

29:59.632 --> 30:00.947
The symptoms fit.

-(grunting)
-CAPSHAW: These people

30:02.693 --> 30:03.616
are internally bleeding.

30:03.636 --> 30:04.635
I need more hands.

30:04.862 --> 30:06.194
Nobody's dying today.

30:07.031 --> 30:09.681
They've got us.
We can work together.

30:14.629 --> 30:16.296
Turn around.

30:16.315 --> 30:20.484
You start triage over there.

30:23.063 --> 30:25.972
I'll do this group.

30:26.108 --> 30:27.491
Let's get to work.

30:30.054 --> 30:31.995
Hello?

30:32.832 --> 30:35.499
Is anybody here?

30:43.658 --> 30:44.824
Check.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.493
You helped solve a murder,
Gerald.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.346
You can handle...

30:49.573 --> 30:51.239
a little deposition.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.018
Impossible.
You know I can't leave.

30:55.837 --> 30:57.503
(softly):
Yes, you can.

30:57.523 --> 31:01.024
You don't have to be trapped
in here.

31:03.345 --> 31:05.028
This is your next move.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.739
No, it's not.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.075
Checkmate.

31:12.763 --> 31:15.205

31:18.860 --> 31:20.193

31:20.287 --> 31:22.604
-Uh, that was the last bag.
-Here.

31:22.623 --> 31:25.215
Go to the stockroom
and get some more.

31:27.611 --> 31:29.277

-JT called. He found Clayton.
-And?

His twin found him first,
beat him half to death.

-Where's Felix now?
-He wants to bring
Clayton back home,

of the witness.

-I-I'm sorry, Gerald.
-I mean...

That's a text, which means
it's not my father.

32:48.542 --> 32:49.991
It's Dani.

-We have to leave.
-What? Why?

You're not listening to me.

34:15.203 --> 34:18.638
Martin is escaping.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.786
Okay. Here's what
I want you to do, Jess.

34:24.879 --> 34:28.899
<i> Find something to defend</i>
<i> yourself with, then hide.</i>

34:29.126 --> 34:30.216
I'm on my way.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.695
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

34:40.728 --> 34:43.246
I know what you saw, old man.

34:46.476 --> 34:47.626
But don't worry.

34:49.813 --> 34:52.005
I'm not gonna do that to you.

34:57.671 --> 34:59.971
Not if you come out now.

35:11.501 --> 35:13.593
GERALD (whispering):
This isn't happening.

35:13.612 --> 35:17.188
(whispering): We can't stay
here. We have to evade capture.

35:17.341 --> 35:18.949
What's the move, Gerald?

35:19.100 --> 35:20.283
The basement.

35:20.510 --> 35:23.178
We'd be open targets. Try again.

35:23.196 --> 35:25.847
There's a closet.
Diagonal across the hall.

35:25.866 --> 35:27.773
It's not big enough
for both of us.

35:27.793 --> 35:31.519
Gerald, we're in the endgame.

35:31.538 --> 35:35.114
There's only one play
for a pawn.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.634
Get to the end of the board.

35:39.471 --> 35:43.031
You mean, outside?

35:43.049 --> 35:45.142
I can't. I can't.

35:46.036 --> 35:47.686
It's now or never.

35:49.464 --> 35:51.982
Blackmailing Dr. Capshaw, Friar?

35:52.133 --> 35:53.150
How Christlike.

35:53.301 --> 35:54.651
What would you know
about it, Judas?

35:54.878 --> 35:55.877
Shut up.

35:55.896 --> 35:58.638
MAN:
Let's move. This way.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.715
Pharaoh's army approaches.

36:00.734 --> 36:02.492
Get the restraints.

36:02.644 --> 36:04.886
Secure the whole area!

36:04.979 --> 36:06.663
Go, go! Move!

36:06.890 --> 36:09.958

36:19.569 --> 36:21.428

36:28.836 --> 36:29.669
You?

36:29.763 --> 36:30.670
(gasps)

36:30.764 --> 36:33.064
Wait, where have I
seen you before?

36:34.267 --> 36:36.267
You're The Surgeon's wife!

36:36.361 --> 36:39.345
(laughing)

36:39.364 --> 36:40.939
(forced laugh)
Did-did Martin send you?

36:41.033 --> 36:43.349
You're-you're,
you're a friend of his?

36:43.368 --> 36:46.261
No, nah. We hate The Surgeon.

36:46.279 --> 36:47.687
We?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.998
Yeah, me and Willie.

36:51.284 --> 36:52.392
Oh.

36:52.452 --> 36:54.711
Well, this
is a misunderstanding,

36:54.862 --> 36:57.881
'cause I hate Martin, too.

36:58.032 --> 37:00.199
Despise the man,
so we are on the same side.

37:00.293 --> 37:01.885
Uh-huh. Fool me once,

37:02.112 --> 37:03.887
shame on you.

37:04.114 --> 37:06.781
Fool me twice...

37:06.800 --> 37:07.966
(gasps)

37:08.060 --> 37:09.517
...kill your wife.

37:14.624 --> 37:15.640

37:20.630 --> 37:22.239
You hear that?

37:23.575 --> 37:27.302
Willie's got a wicked
imagination for hurting people.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.653
Don't...

37:29.414 --> 37:31.731
Don't you take another step.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.807

37:55.256 --> 37:58.191
Rosalie was a nice girl.

37:59.169 --> 38:01.669
I didn't want to hurt her.

38:01.763 --> 38:05.006
All she had to do was tell me
where my brother was.

38:05.099 --> 38:07.675

they were in love.
