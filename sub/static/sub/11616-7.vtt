USUALLY METH HEADS

09:15.789 --> 09:16.772
AND AGGRESSIVE.

09:16.773 --> 09:17.756

ARE CHEMICALS TO HUFF IN HERE,

09:20.661 --> 09:22.127
THEY'LL RUN THROUGH WALLS
TO GET IN.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.194

09:32.088 --> 09:33.237
THOSE GUYS HAVE BEEN
DOWN THERE FOR DAYS.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.340
SO THE THUG COULD
HAVE GIVEN THEM ACCESS,

09:35.342 --> 09:36.641
MAYBE EVEN TOLD THEM
WHAT WE GOT IN HERE.

09:36.643 --> 09:39.544
HE COULD HAVE SEEN
ALL THE CHEMICALS.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.916
OK. THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET IN,

09:44.918 --> 09:46.451
SO WE NEED TO SECURE
THIS OFFICE.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.520

THIS BUILDING THE BEST.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.292
THIS PLACE ISN'T
THE IVORY TOWER

09:54.294 --> 09:56.461

A CODE-SECURE ELEVATOR,

09:56.463 --> 09:58.296

CLOSED CIRCUIT,

09:58.298 --> 09:59.598

ARE ACCESSIBLE,

09:59.600 --> 10:01.499
AND THERE'S A FIRE EXIT
ON THE ROOF

10:01.501 --> 10:02.634
THAT LEADS
TO THE STAIRWELL.

10:02.636 --> 10:06.004
OK. SO WE LOCK DOWN
THE FIRE EXIT,

10:06.006 --> 10:07.138

10:16.984 --> 10:18.183

NOT SMOKE.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.918

YOU EXPLODE.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.052

10:21.054 --> 10:22.420
