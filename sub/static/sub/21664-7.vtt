00:00.641 --> 00:02.441
Frankie,
it's time to go charge.

00:18.108 --> 00:19.608
- We've got a problem.

00:19.708 --> 00:21.608
- What are you...?
You can't be in here.

00:21.708 --> 00:24.074
- Jenny, just relax.

00:24.174 --> 00:25.541
- You're not seeing
my sister, Dayton.

00:25.641 --> 00:27.341
You see, this is all
just a crazy dream.

00:27.441 --> 00:29.574
- Listen to me,
Tammy isn't in bed,

00:29.674 --> 00:31.441
which means she's wandering
around the house,

00:31.541 --> 00:34.908
which means we've gotta get
Frankie back in bed asap.

00:35.008 --> 00:36.708
Power her up.
- Wait, you know?

00:36.808 --> 00:38.474
- Now is not
the time for this.

00:47.174 --> 00:49.141
- Her battery's
totally dead.

00:49.241 --> 00:50.808
I can't wake her up.

00:54.841 --> 00:56.208
What are you guys doing?

00:56.274 --> 00:59.841
- Anxiously awaiting
an update from you.

00:59.941 --> 01:01.274
Lucia!

01:01.374 --> 01:02.708
What's going on?

01:02.808 --> 01:04.441
- I was waiting for
Frankie to go to sleep,

01:04.541 --> 01:06.574
so I could look for
my diary on her computer,

01:06.674 --> 01:07.741
but she's awake.

01:07.841 --> 01:09.441
What do I do now?

01:09.541 --> 01:12.208
Wow, I was
having the craziest dream.

01:12.274 --> 01:13.908
Tammy was screaming at us.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.208
- I said,
what do I do now?!

01:16.274 --> 01:17.908
- Maybe you should
just go to sleep

01:18.008 --> 01:19.641
and figure it out
in the morning.

01:19.741 --> 01:20.808
- I can't.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.474
If I can't get to Frankie's
computer tonight,

01:22.574 --> 01:24.341
she'll still have
enough dirt on me

01:24.441 --> 01:26.274
to plant an industrial
cornfield.

01:26.374 --> 01:28.308
- Now Tammy's screeching
about cornfields.

01:28.408 --> 01:30.041
I've gotta get
outta this dream.

01:30.208 --> 01:31.008
No, wait!

01:35.008 --> 01:36.408
I expected
her to be heavier.

01:36.508 --> 01:39.008
My mom used titanium
for her endoskeleton.

01:39.108 --> 01:41.541
- Strong and lightweight.
- Oh.

01:41.641 --> 01:42.808
That was smart.

01:42.908 --> 01:44.841
- Hey!

01:44.941 --> 01:46.008
- Hey, Tammy.

01:46.108 --> 01:47.208
- What's with her?

01:47.308 --> 01:49.008
- Shhh, you'll wake her.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.674
- So?

01:51.774 --> 01:53.841
- She was sleepwalking.

01:53.941 --> 01:55.874
You never wake
a sleepwalker.

01:55.974 --> 01:56.841
They can be dangerous.

01:56.941 --> 01:58.674
Or unpredictable.

01:58.774 --> 02:01.108
- I thought that
was common knowledge.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.208
Guess not.

02:02.274 --> 02:03.741
- No, no, I...

02:03.841 --> 02:04.874
I knew that.

02:04.974 --> 02:06.208
I was just testing you,

02:06.308 --> 02:08.741
to make sure
you knew it, too.

02:35.074 --> 02:36.608
Oh, no.

02:41.341 --> 02:42.974
- Wake up.
- Huh?

02:43.074 --> 02:44.874
- Tammy's on
the loose again.

02:48.274 --> 02:50.608
Can I help you
with something?

02:50.708 --> 02:52.508
- I... I woke up early.

02:52.608 --> 02:55.308
I thought I'd just check
my email on Frankie's computer.

02:55.408 --> 02:56.941
- Why don't you use
the little computer

02:57.041 --> 02:58.341
you've got in your hand?

02:58.441 --> 03:00.108
- Oh, this? It's...

03:00.208 --> 03:01.408
out of battery.

03:03.741 --> 03:05.074
- Almost...

03:05.208 --> 03:07.208
out of battery.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.841
I'll call you
back, Lucia.

03:08.941 --> 03:10.708
- Did you get
into Frankie's...

03:10.808 --> 03:15.608
- Um, we can't
go into Frankie's room.

03:15.708 --> 03:17.008
We just bug
bombed it, remember?

03:17.108 --> 03:19.208
- I thought it was mold.

03:19.274 --> 03:22.274
- Uh, it is.
The mold...

03:22.374 --> 03:24.508
attracted mildew mites...

03:24.608 --> 03:28.108
so, they had to treat
the mold and the mites.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.841
- Mold attracts bugs?

03:30.941 --> 03:32.208
- Yeah.

03:32.241 --> 03:33.674
I thought that was
common knowledge.

03:33.774 --> 03:35.274
Guess not.

03:35.374 --> 03:36.841
- Oh...

03:36.941 --> 03:38.274
would you look
at the time.

03:38.374 --> 03:40.274
I've gotta go. Adios.

03:50.374 --> 03:51.574
- All charged up.

03:51.674 --> 03:53.274
- According to
my battery meter,

03:53.374 --> 03:54.708
I'm at full power.

03:54.808 --> 03:57.208
- Good, because you're
gonna need all your power...

03:57.274 --> 03:58.508
To pack.

03:58.608 --> 04:01.608
Thanks to you, Mom's
gonna make us move again.

04:02.841 --> 04:05.041
- Jenny, please don't tell
Mom that Dayton Reyes

04:05.208 --> 04:06.208
knows I'm an android.

04:06.274 --> 04:08.308
- You're asking
me to lie to Mom...

04:08.408 --> 04:09.841
Like you've been doing?

04:09.941 --> 04:12.208
Hey, aren't you programmed
to always tell the truth?

04:12.274 --> 04:13.241
- It's not lying.

04:13.341 --> 04:14.408
Keeping a secret
between friends

04:14.508 --> 04:16.440
isn't the same as lying.

04:16.541 --> 04:19.408
I swear, Jenny, Frankie's
secret is safe with me.

04:19.507 --> 04:20.673
She's my best friend.

04:20.774 --> 04:22.808
I would never let
anything happen to her.

04:24.041 --> 04:27.308
I helped keep Tammy
from finding out, didn't I?

04:27.408 --> 04:28.541
- That's true.

04:28.641 --> 04:30.341
- So, there's no
reason to tell your Mom.

04:30.441 --> 04:32.508
The secret stops here.

04:32.608 --> 04:33.908
- I won't tell.
- Yay!

04:34.008 --> 04:35.208
Thank you, Jenny.

04:35.274 --> 04:36.408
- Under one condition.

04:36.508 --> 04:38.308
You get to be my servant
for the next month

04:38.408 --> 04:39.674
and do all of my chores.
- What?!

04:39.774 --> 04:41.241
And aren't you
a little bit young

04:41.341 --> 04:42.641
to be going around
blackmailing people?

04:42.741 --> 04:44.774
- I've always been
advanced for my age.

04:44.874 --> 04:46.508
Well?

04:48.208 --> 04:49.808
- I accept your terms.

05:13.101 --> 05:14.401
- Does serving as
a game system

05:14.501 --> 05:15.919
fall under the category
of chores?

05:15.930 --> 05:17.996
I cannot find any sources
to confirm this.

05:18.407 --> 05:20.841
- Shhh, it's dangerous
to talk to the driver

05:20.941 --> 05:22.541
while the vehicle
is in motion.

05:22.641 --> 05:24.807
- Jenny, when I said you should
play more with your sister,

05:24.907 --> 05:26.441
this wasn't what
I had in mind.

05:26.541 --> 05:27.774
- It's okay, Dad.

05:27.874 --> 05:30.341
You don't mind,
do you, Frankie?

05:31.082 --> 05:32.682
- Maybe let Frankie
speak for herself.

05:32.782 --> 05:33.749
- I don't mind, Dad.

05:33.849 --> 05:36.549
- Then slide over.
I've got it next.

05:36.582 --> 05:37.915
- I need Frankie.

05:38.015 --> 05:39.982
- Oh, no fair.
It's my turn.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.615
Your mother needs you.

05:45.949 --> 05:47.982
- It's about your
friend Tammy.

05:48.082 --> 05:49.715
- Friend?

05:49.815 --> 05:50.782
Frenemy is more
like it.

05:50.882 --> 05:52.915
She was snooping
around all night.

05:53.015 --> 05:54.749
I caught her trying
to sneak into your lab.

05:54.849 --> 05:57.849
- I knew I should've
stayed up all night.

05:57.949 --> 06:00.649
You and your
asparagus smoothie!

06:00.749 --> 06:01.915
- Don't worry,
we stopped her.

06:02.015 --> 06:03.549
- We? Well... who's we?

06:03.649 --> 06:04.882
Wasn't Frankie
recharging?

06:04.982 --> 06:07.549
- Yeah, it just...

06:07.615 --> 06:09.349
what us kids
say these days.

06:09.449 --> 06:10.715
"We" instead of "I."

06:10.815 --> 06:12.849
We so cool.

06:12.949 --> 06:15.382
- It's true.
We know what's up.

06:18.049 --> 06:19.349
Ha. Ha.

06:19.449 --> 06:22.049
We're gonna go see
what's for lunch.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.382
- I know to be careful
of Tammy, Mom.

06:24.549 --> 06:26.849
I always keep her at least
80 centimeters away.

06:26.949 --> 06:28.615
- Eighty centimeters?
- Arm's length.

06:28.715 --> 06:32.382
- Oh, that's good, Frankie,
but it's not good enough.

06:32.549 --> 06:33.882
- Greater distance
could be challenging

06:33.982 --> 06:35.449
during Brain Squad
competitions...

06:35.549 --> 06:37.282
Unless you're saying
I can't be on the team.

06:37.382 --> 06:39.815
- No, Frankie,
I'm not saying that.

06:39.915 --> 06:42.749
- Good. I wanna bring
glory to Sepulveda High.

06:42.849 --> 06:44.982
- Last night,
when those boys came over,

06:45.082 --> 06:47.582
it was pretty clear that
Tammy has a crush

06:47.682 --> 06:48.682
on that boy Cole.

06:48.782 --> 06:50.982
- Yes, Tammy like-likes
Cole Reyes.

06:51.082 --> 06:52.882
Like-likes means she gets
a warm, fuzzy feeling

06:52.982 --> 06:53.982
when he's around.

06:54.082 --> 06:55.882
But Cole Reyes
like-likes me.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.082
Dayton Reyes told me.

06:57.182 --> 06:59.115
- I could see that,
too, Frankie,

06:59.215 --> 07:02.549
and that's why you need
to stay away from Cole.

07:05.215 --> 07:06.882
- Printing complete.

07:06.982 --> 07:08.982
Well, it's about time.

07:09.082 --> 07:12.682
Let's see what Sigourney
was kind enough to give me.

07:12.782 --> 07:14.782
Hmmm...

07:14.882 --> 07:17.182
That's a handsome honker.

07:17.282 --> 07:18.749
You're gonna be
quite the hunk...

07:18.849 --> 07:21.282
Just like your old man.

07:21.382 --> 07:22.915
What's next?

07:23.015 --> 07:26.315
Oh, I hope that little
battery mishap didn't mean

07:26.415 --> 07:28.982
I missed out on
any data you'll need.

07:30.549 --> 07:31.749
Ooh!

07:31.849 --> 07:33.615
Time to fabricate
your hair...

07:33.715 --> 07:35.949
Or should I say
"furbricate"?

07:39.382 --> 07:40.615
You get it?

07:40.715 --> 07:42.549
Fur. It's like hair.

07:44.115 --> 07:47.282
Oh, I'd better have a look at
your humor-processing function.

07:47.382 --> 07:50.449
You're gonna need
that for school on Monday.

07:51.915 --> 07:55.182
And if all goes well,
we won't need Frankie anymore,

07:55.282 --> 08:00.015
and we can get rid of
her once and for all.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.949
- Who wants pizza
bagels for lunch?

08:06.049 --> 08:07.149
- Me!

08:07.249 --> 08:08.549
- I can't do that.

08:08.649 --> 08:10.449
- I know, Frankie.
You have no digestive system.

08:10.549 --> 08:12.549
- I'm not referring
to pizza bagels.

08:12.615 --> 08:14.215
What I can't do is follow
your instructions

08:14.315 --> 08:15.915
regarding Cole Reyes.

08:16.015 --> 08:16.982
- What do you mean?

08:17.082 --> 08:18.649
- I don't wanna stay
away from him.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.549
I like-like
Cole Reyes, too.

08:20.615 --> 08:21.815
- You what?

08:21.915 --> 08:23.582
- I know I'm not designed

08:23.682 --> 08:25.249
to feel emotions,
but I do.

08:25.349 --> 08:28.715
- Whoa, this is way
better than pizza bagels.

08:28.815 --> 08:30.549
- Can you describe
your emotions?

08:30.582 --> 08:32.849
What does it feel like
when Cole's around?

08:32.948 --> 08:35.948
- I experience an electrical
misfiring in my chest cavity.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.015
- That's how I felt
when I first saw you.

08:38.115 --> 08:40.649
- Oh, that's interesting
and surprising.

08:40.749 --> 08:44.082
I'd like to run some tests
to explore these, uh,

08:44.182 --> 08:46.782
feelings,
but in the meantime,

08:46.882 --> 08:48.315
I need you to
do as I say.

08:48.415 --> 08:50.182
It's for your
own safety.

08:50.282 --> 08:51.549
You need to stay
away from Cole.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.715
You need to stay
away from Cole.

08:53.815 --> 08:55.549
You need to...

08:57.415 --> 09:00.282
Frankie? Frankie?

09:00.382 --> 09:02.749
I... I think it's
a hardware anomaly.

09:02.849 --> 09:03.949
- I think it's
a broken heart.

09:04.049 --> 09:05.449
- She doesn't have
a heart, Will.

09:05.549 --> 09:08.015
Here, help me get
her to the lab.

09:09.882 --> 09:10.982
I'm okay, Mom.
- Are you sure?

09:11.082 --> 09:12.215
Run your diagnostics,
please.

09:14.149 --> 09:16.149
CPU, network, disc,
and memory all pass.

09:16.249 --> 09:17.415
- Oh, thank goodness.

09:17.549 --> 09:19.149
- And I will follow
your instructions

09:19.249 --> 09:20.549
regarding Cole Reyes.

09:20.649 --> 09:22.382
- Thank you, Frankie.

09:24.749 --> 09:26.249
I'm sorry.

09:28.349 --> 09:29.982
Let me out of here.

09:33.715 --> 09:35.282
Dizzy.

09:37.049 --> 09:38.949
Oh?

09:39.049 --> 09:43.082
I wonder if there's
any juice left in her.

09:44.782 --> 09:46.715
Please, don't hurt me!
Please, don't hurt me!

09:46.815 --> 09:48.149
I'm too young to die!

09:48.249 --> 09:50.315
It's a shame.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.115
Now I only have three
gifts for Mr. Kingston.

09:52.215 --> 09:55.449
Oh, he's going to be
so excited to see me.

09:55.549 --> 09:59.515
- Oooh, you'll look
sharp in this, my boy.

09:59.615 --> 10:00.949
Yes.

10:01.049 --> 10:03.449
- Now, remember,
when you get to school,

10:03.549 --> 10:07.882
find Frankie Gaines
and keep a close eye on her.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.549
We need to make sure
that nothing she,

10:09.649 --> 10:13.215
or Sigourney does
can derail my plans.

10:13.315 --> 10:16.449
- I have school.
- Wait!

10:16.549 --> 10:19.949
You forgot your
jacket for...

10:27.682 --> 10:30.115
- Oooh!

10:30.215 --> 10:33.849
- 669, 668, 670.

10:33.949 --> 10:35.349
- What are you doing?

10:35.449 --> 10:37.315
- Quiet, please. I'm counting
the hairs on my left arm.

10:37.415 --> 10:42.482
- So, that's
778, 779, 780.

10:42.582 --> 10:45.782
- Welcome to
Sepulveda High, boys.

10:45.882 --> 10:46.915
This is Dayton.

10:47.015 --> 10:49.749
She is the head of
our Red Carpet Club.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.115
She's gonna show
you around.

10:51.215 --> 10:54.915
Now, which one of you
is Robbie Turnbull?

10:55.015 --> 10:56.649
- I am Robbie.

10:56.749 --> 10:59.182
- And you are...

10:59.282 --> 11:01.115
Rufus.
Rufus Leeking?

11:01.215 --> 11:03.549
Yeah, sure.

11:03.615 --> 11:07.715
- Roof is leaking.
Very funny.

11:07.815 --> 11:09.315
- Andrew.
Andrew LaPierre.

11:09.415 --> 11:11.615
Good luck with these two.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.282
- Frankie?

11:14.382 --> 11:16.082
- You need to stay
away from Cole.

11:16.182 --> 11:17.982
- It was so fun to
see you on Friday night.

11:18.082 --> 11:19.649
Too bad we couldn't
stay longer, but I...

11:21.849 --> 11:23.349
...thought it was fun.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.982
Did you
have a nice weekend?

11:33.082 --> 11:34.915
What? Get...

11:35.015 --> 11:37.015
PEGSI, how did
you get out?

11:37.115 --> 11:38.149
That's not
important, sir.

11:38.249 --> 11:40.215
What's important is
that I did get out,

11:40.315 --> 11:42.615
and no one will separate
us ever again.

11:42.715 --> 11:44.449
- You and I seem to have
a slightly different

11:44.549 --> 11:46.282
understanding
of our relationship.

11:46.382 --> 11:47.982
Now,
if you'll just follow me.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.415
You're going to
be very happy.

11:49.549 --> 11:51.582
- Oh, I'm not very
happy right now.

11:51.682 --> 11:53.315
Silly Mr. Kingston.

11:53.415 --> 11:55.782
I have the answer
to our problems.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.615
- This had better
be good.

12:01.222 --> 12:02.655
- This is our trophy case.

12:02.755 --> 12:03.888
We're not the best
at sports,

12:03.988 --> 12:06.422
but our Brain Squad team
is really good,

12:06.522 --> 12:10.522
and some... uh, uh, is something
the matter there, Robbie?

12:10.622 --> 12:12.122
- I'm just assessing
whether the display case

12:12.222 --> 12:13.655
is glass or Plexiglas.

12:13.755 --> 12:14.788
A highly-developed
sense of smell

12:14.888 --> 12:16.588
can discern
the difference.

12:18.388 --> 12:20.022
It's glass.

12:20.122 --> 12:23.788
- That's, um,
good to know.

12:23.888 --> 12:25.722
Hey, guys, come meet
a friend of mine.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.822
- Hi, I am Frankie.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.622
- Hi, I am Robbie.

12:30.722 --> 12:32.022
- Hey, I'm Andrew.

12:32.122 --> 12:33.788
Why do they call
you Frankie?

12:33.888 --> 12:35.322
- It's the name
Mom gave me.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.022
- Yeah, but isn't
it a guy's name?

12:37.122 --> 12:39.222
Hm, you don't
look like a guy.

12:40.488 --> 12:42.222
- I am Frankie because
it starts with an "F."

12:42.288 --> 12:43.955
"F" is the sixth letter
of the alphabet.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.255
I have five precursors.

12:45.355 --> 12:47.255
- She means brothers
and sisters!

12:47.355 --> 12:49.822
She's so funny.

12:49.922 --> 12:51.788
Frankie and I need
to have a quick chat.

12:51.888 --> 12:52.822
Be right back.

12:55.222 --> 12:59.488
- You've gotta save me.
This Robbie guy is so weird.

12:59.588 --> 13:00.588
Oh!

13:00.688 --> 13:02.388
Peculiar
flossing technique.

13:02.488 --> 13:04.122
He doesn't appear
to be dangerous.

13:04.222 --> 13:05.755
But I trust
your judgment.

13:05.855 --> 13:07.722
Stay back!
- No!

13:07.822 --> 13:10.055
I just meant join
us on the tour

13:10.222 --> 13:12.522
so I don't have to deal
with his weirdness alone.

13:12.622 --> 13:14.288
- Oh? Gladly.

13:20.888 --> 13:21.922
Ta-da!

13:22.022 --> 13:24.255
Prototypes of
the Gaines android.

13:24.355 --> 13:25.855
If any of them
are functional,

13:25.955 --> 13:27.488
we can use it
for Project Q

13:27.588 --> 13:30.655
and then those thugs from
Warpa will be off your case.

13:30.755 --> 13:33.755
- Not exactly.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.655
The stolen android
had some flaws,

13:36.755 --> 13:39.755
so, if Gaines has abandoned
these prototypes,

13:39.855 --> 13:41.322
they must be even worse.

13:41.422 --> 13:44.655
No, we still need to get
back the stolen android.

13:44.755 --> 13:46.355
But...

13:46.455 --> 13:48.222
if we can get these
things working,

13:48.322 --> 13:51.388
it will buy us some
time to find it.

13:52.722 --> 13:53.855
Good work, PEGSI.

13:53.955 --> 13:55.222
How about a hug?

13:55.255 --> 13:56.555
- Don't push your luck.

14:03.222 --> 14:04.988
- Waiting for
a portal to open?

14:05.088 --> 14:07.788
You know, some kind
of magical underworld.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.055
Aren't they always
in lockers?

14:09.222 --> 14:11.988
- Oh... I was
just thinking.

14:12.088 --> 14:13.755
I'm trying to figure
out what I did wrong.

14:13.855 --> 14:14.988
- Ooh, I'll help.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.755
I'm an excellent
diagnostician.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.755
So, this thing
you did wrong,

14:18.855 --> 14:19.955
was it on a test?

14:20.055 --> 14:21.255
- It was with Frankie.

14:21.355 --> 14:22.688
I tried to talk
to her today,

14:22.788 --> 14:24.455
but she just walked away
without saying a word.

14:24.555 --> 14:25.888
- What did you
say to her?

14:25.988 --> 14:28.388
- Just that it was really fun
seeing her on Friday night.

14:28.488 --> 14:30.355
Did I do anything wrong
when we crashed the sleepover?

14:30.455 --> 14:32.055
- You mean besides
crashing her sleepover?

14:32.222 --> 14:33.922
- She was happy
we were there.

14:34.022 --> 14:35.288
She hugged me.

14:35.388 --> 14:37.488
So, what could it be?

14:41.755 --> 14:42.955
- Well?
- I got nothin'.

14:43.055 --> 14:45.922
- You said you were an excellent
dietician or whatever.

14:46.022 --> 14:47.088
- Yeah, with tests
and papers.

14:47.222 --> 14:50.255
Girls? Forget
about it.

14:50.355 --> 14:52.488
Worst
sleepover ever.

14:52.588 --> 14:54.355
Her mother is a complete
control freak,

14:54.455 --> 14:56.288
her little sister
is bossy,

14:56.388 --> 14:58.355
and I couldn't get
near her computer.

14:58.455 --> 15:00.122
A total waste of time.

15:00.222 --> 15:02.388
- Too bad.
Ours was fun.

15:03.988 --> 15:05.055
But I'm still convinced

15:05.222 --> 15:06.522
something's up
with Frankie.

15:06.622 --> 15:09.355
- And the unhealthy Frankie
obsession continues.

15:09.455 --> 15:12.422
- I don't have
an obsession.

15:12.522 --> 15:15.122
Okay, maybe I do,
but it's not unhealthy.

15:15.222 --> 15:16.622
It's a healthy
obsession.

15:16.722 --> 15:17.655
- There's no such thing.

15:17.755 --> 15:20.055
- There is now.
I just invented it.

15:20.222 --> 15:21.455
Now stop arguing with me

15:21.555 --> 15:24.022
or I'll make you sit out
of the Brain Squad meet.

15:24.122 --> 15:25.488
- Speaking of which,
Makayla and I

15:25.588 --> 15:27.288
came up with the perfect
selection method

15:27.388 --> 15:29.222
during our sleepover.

15:29.322 --> 15:31.122
Rock, paper, scissors!

15:31.222 --> 15:32.755
- That only works
for two people.

15:32.855 --> 15:34.288
- Not anymore.

15:34.388 --> 15:36.022
We just invented MORPS,

15:36.122 --> 15:39.555
Multi-player On-line
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

15:39.655 --> 15:43.255
- Okay, well, I'm still team
captain, so what I say goes,

15:43.355 --> 15:45.855
and I say we do
another written test.

15:45.955 --> 15:47.122
- You know,
one of these days,

15:47.222 --> 15:48.888
you're not gonna have us
to kick around anymore.

15:48.988 --> 15:50.422
- Of course, I will.

15:52.255 --> 15:56.488
- She's right.
We'll keep coming back.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.755
The rules of high school
cliques require it.

15:59.855 --> 16:01.822
- It's so unfair...

16:01.922 --> 16:03.822
but so true.

16:07.422 --> 16:09.322
- And this is
the cafeteria.

16:09.422 --> 16:11.255
We always have
options available

16:11.355 --> 16:13.122
for vegetarian, vegan,
gluten-free, kosher,

16:13.222 --> 16:14.788
and halal diets.

16:14.888 --> 16:16.088
- We do?
- Yeah.

16:16.222 --> 16:17.655
- It's called
"bring your own lunch,"

16:17.755 --> 16:19.455
and that completes our tour.
Any questions?

16:19.555 --> 16:21.355
- What's the Wi-Fi
frequency...

16:21.455 --> 16:23.322
2.4 or 5 gigahertz?

16:23.422 --> 16:26.388
- Both are available.
The protocol is 802.11n.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.122
- There she is.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.455
She seems okay to me.

16:30.555 --> 16:32.122
She's definitely being
friendly to that

16:32.222 --> 16:34.255
super-good-looking guy
who's smiling at her.

16:34.355 --> 16:38.255
- Uh, Frankie.

16:38.355 --> 16:40.255
- You need to stay
away from Cole.

16:40.355 --> 16:42.022
You need to stay
away from Cole.

16:42.122 --> 16:43.788
You need to stay
away from Cole.

16:55.355 --> 16:58.255
- Oh? I see
what you mean.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.788
You definitely
did something wrong.

17:01.408 --> 17:03.208
- I have to go, Dayton Reyes.
Cole is coming.

17:03.308 --> 17:05.208
Mom says I have to
stay away from him.

17:05.308 --> 17:06.473
- What? Why?

17:06.608 --> 17:09.407
Hey... guys.

17:09.508 --> 17:12.674
Uh, meet Robbie and Andrew.
They're new.

17:12.773 --> 17:13.708
I'm showing them around.

17:13.808 --> 17:15.508
Guys, this is
Cole and Byron.

17:15.608 --> 17:17.308
- I am Robbie.

17:17.407 --> 17:19.308
- Andrew.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.874
- Hey.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.208
What?

17:26.308 --> 17:27.874
Oh.

17:27.973 --> 17:30.741
Take that
handshake back.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.008
- Real smooth, Byron.

17:32.108 --> 17:34.108
- You know I got
your back.

17:36.008 --> 17:36.908
- Yes, sir,
I completely understand.

17:37.008 --> 17:38.641
You are upset with
with the delays,

17:38.741 --> 17:41.708
but I can assure you that
Project Q is back on track.

17:41.808 --> 17:43.141
Yes, sir, yes.

17:43.241 --> 17:44.708
Well, as a matter
of fact,

17:44.808 --> 17:47.174
I am currently standing
in front of three

17:47.274 --> 17:49.774
fully-functional
androids who are...

17:49.874 --> 17:51.041
...more
than up to the task.

17:53.341 --> 17:55.474
- Oh, no. No, no,
not you, sir, no.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.608
Yes, of course, I will
keep you up to date.

17:57.641 --> 17:58.974
Yes, sir.

17:59.074 --> 18:04.208
Aw, PEGSI, we need to make
these androids functional,

18:04.308 --> 18:06.274
because I think
Warpa is onto us.

18:06.374 --> 18:07.508
But they will work, sir.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.208
They all just have
little bugs we'll work out.

18:10.308 --> 18:13.008
Their behavior is
a little unpredictable.

18:13.108 --> 18:14.974
But they just need
a little tweaking.

18:15.074 --> 18:16.508
What?

18:16.608 --> 18:18.308
I said, they just
need a little tweaking.

18:18.408 --> 18:20.074
You're going antiquing?

18:20.174 --> 18:22.341
Now? Well,
what about the droids?

18:22.441 --> 18:25.041
I said tweaking,
not antiquing.

18:25.141 --> 18:26.074
What?

18:27.308 --> 18:29.241
Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot!

18:30.608 --> 18:32.441
This is so cool.

18:33.374 --> 18:34.808
- If you're gonna
be on this team,

18:34.908 --> 18:36.008
you need to be on time.

18:36.108 --> 18:37.774
- You told me to be
here at 3:00.

18:37.874 --> 18:39.041
It is 2:55.

18:39.141 --> 18:42.208
- Well, you must
have misheard me.

18:42.308 --> 18:45.774
Okay, now that we're
all here, let's begin.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.008
The Nydegger Intelligence Test
measures numerical, verbal,

18:49.108 --> 18:51.374
spatial and logical
aptitude.

18:51.474 --> 18:52.874
The top four scores
will join me

18:52.974 --> 18:54.974
on the competition squad
for tomorrow's meet.

18:55.074 --> 18:56.841
- Why are you
automatically in?

18:56.941 --> 18:58.041
I'm the captain.

18:58.141 --> 18:59.441
- You made
yourself captain.

18:59.608 --> 19:01.774
You should have to
take the test...

19:01.874 --> 19:03.341
Just like everyone else.

19:03.441 --> 19:05.341
- Uh, fine.

19:19.608 --> 19:21.608
Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot!

19:22.908 --> 19:24.774
Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot!

19:26.108 --> 19:28.241
- Hey, what's that?
- Uh, nothing.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.374
- This is your test.

19:35.474 --> 19:36.674
- Uh, I know.

19:36.774 --> 19:37.841
I got the highest score

19:37.941 --> 19:40.008
and I didn't want
you guys to feel bad.

19:45.041 --> 19:47.441
95 percent,

19:47.608 --> 19:49.808
95 percent,

19:49.908 --> 19:52.374
92 percent,

19:52.474 --> 19:54.741
96 percent,

19:54.841 --> 19:56.774
100 percent!

19:56.874 --> 19:58.874
Whoa.

19:58.974 --> 20:01.741
And, Tammy: 91 percent.

20:04.041 --> 20:06.574
- So? The test is flawed.

20:06.674 --> 20:08.741
All intelligence
tests are.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.208
It doesn't mean anything.

20:10.308 --> 20:12.408
- It means one thing...

20:12.508 --> 20:14.874
Next competition,
you're warming the bench.

20:19.474 --> 20:22.208
Hey, Day.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.874
Frankie's been
acting so weird.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.708
She won't talk to me
or come near me.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.974
- I haven't noticed
anything.

20:28.074 --> 20:30.441
Are you sure it's
not your imagination?

20:30.541 --> 20:32.374
Are you sick?
Do you have a fever?

20:32.474 --> 20:33.774
That can cause
hallucinations.

20:33.874 --> 20:35.341
- I'm not sick.

20:35.441 --> 20:37.874
Will you talk to her?
- Me?

20:37.974 --> 20:40.174
What kind of a guy
has his little sister

20:40.274 --> 20:42.341
talk to a girl he likes?

20:42.441 --> 20:43.908
So lame!

20:44.008 --> 20:45.974
I mean, think about
your reputation.

20:46.074 --> 20:48.641
- Right. That is
pretty weak.

20:48.741 --> 20:50.008
Do it anyway.

20:50.108 --> 20:51.408
I don't care
about that stuff.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.608
- Don't feel bad
about being benched.

21:00.708 --> 21:03.608
- Yeah. Feel bad for lying
about your test score.

21:04.941 --> 21:07.841
- Substitutes have been
responsible for great things.

21:07.941 --> 21:09.774
Take Ulysses S. Grant.

21:09.874 --> 21:12.674
He was the fourth choice for
the Commander of the Union Army,

21:12.774 --> 21:14.674
and he won the Civil War.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.808
- Being the sub is going
to be very important

21:16.908 --> 21:17.974
in this competition.

21:18.074 --> 21:19.741
Remember, anyone who
tries to cheat

21:19.841 --> 21:21.308
will be kicked out
of the meet.

21:21.408 --> 21:23.774
- Right, but you never did
bust Frankie for cheating.

21:23.874 --> 21:25.208
- Not yet.

21:25.308 --> 21:29.608
But I have a feeling
that's gonna change very soon.

21:29.674 --> 21:31.974
- Oh, excellent.

21:32.074 --> 21:34.341
Quite a first
day you had.

21:34.441 --> 21:36.408
I see you met
your fellow android.

21:37.474 --> 21:39.474
I want you to get
close to her,

21:39.608 --> 21:41.408
gain her trust,

21:41.508 --> 21:43.841
and when the time
is right,

21:43.941 --> 21:46.608
you'll destroy her.

21:49.893 --> 21:56.377
