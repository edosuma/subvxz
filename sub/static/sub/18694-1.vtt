00:07.000 --> 00:08.162
BRENNAN:
<i>Previously on</i> Bones...

00:08.166 --> 00:10.357
HODGINS: We're not dealing
with an amateur psychopath.

00:10.457 --> 00:12.008
This guy's a serial murderer.

00:12.009 --> 00:15.707
Given the killer's M.O.,
<i>it is very likely he is out there</i>

00:15.708 --> 00:17.566
<i>looking for his next victim</i>
<i>as we speak.</i>

00:17.567 --> 00:19.288
You're not taking responsibility
for all this.

00:19.289 --> 00:20.850
Booth.
If we hadn't quit our jobs...

00:20.904 --> 00:22.624
Allison Monroe still
would have been killed.

00:22.751 --> 00:24.484
We know that this guy's
got this, like,

00:24.520 --> 00:26.069
crazy genius IQ level

00:26.105 --> 00:27.771
and he's manipulative
as they come.

00:27.823 --> 00:30.023
BOOTH: Talk about a classroom
from hell.

00:30.025 --> 00:31.608
These are your clothes, Bones.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.410
The victim is meant to be you.

00:33.445 --> 00:36.446
(screaming, gasping)

00:36.498 --> 00:37.976
DR. FAULK: <i>As I said on the phone,</i>
<i>I'm happy to do</i>

00:38.000 --> 00:40.033
<i>whatever I can do</i>
<i>to be of assistance.</i>

00:40.085 --> 00:43.703
But that said, I can't breach
doctor-patient confidentiality.

00:43.705 --> 00:45.539
I'd like you to return
to your dreams.

00:45.541 --> 00:48.191
If you knew what I knew,
you'd be so proud.

00:48.227 --> 00:50.782
(echoing): Who is he? Who is he?
Who is he?

00:50.783 --> 00:52.666
Breach confidentiality
if someone's in danger.

00:52.702 --> 00:53.169
Hey!

00:53.193 --> 00:54.286
Get up here.
You understand me?

00:54.287 --> 00:56.273
She's missing. He took her,
and he's gonna kill her.

00:56.274 --> 00:57.223
I need your damn notes.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.418
She said that your hands
were burnt,

00:58.442 --> 01:00.275
like they'd been in some
kind of an explosion.

01:00.277 --> 01:01.304
HODGINS:
Dreams aren't always literal,

01:01.328 --> 01:03.511
I mean, Wendell could
just be a symbol here.

01:03.547 --> 01:04.663
A symbol for what?

01:04.697 --> 01:07.999
For someone who used to work
at the lab.

01:14.173 --> 01:15.656
Zack?

01:15.691 --> 01:17.858
Dr. Brennan.

01:17.893 --> 01:19.877
It is good to see you again.

01:19.912 --> 01:22.579
You and I...

01:22.615 --> 01:24.248
We have so much to talk about.

01:27.603 --> 01:29.369
Zack...

01:29.421 --> 01:32.539
what have you done?

01:32.541 --> 01:34.048
I need to leave.
I need to find Booth.

01:34.049 --> 01:35.432
Dr. Brennan.
I need Booth.

01:35.467 --> 01:36.864
Please do not
attempt to stand.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.401
(exhales)

01:37.402 --> 01:38.802
The sedative
I administered

01:38.854 --> 01:42.255
is still very much
in your system.

01:42.291 --> 01:45.008
I don't understand
what is happening.

01:45.043 --> 01:47.811
You've been asleep
for almost two hours.

01:47.846 --> 01:50.981
Zack, listen to me.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.899
Let me go.

01:52.901 --> 01:55.902
If you don't,
Booth will find you,

01:55.904 --> 01:57.821
and when he does...
Stop.

01:57.873 --> 02:00.540
I'd prefer you not
talk about him.

02:02.828 --> 02:05.212
Zack, what has
happened to you?

02:05.247 --> 02:07.080
What happened
to your head?

02:08.333 --> 02:11.117
Oh... that.

02:11.153 --> 02:14.754
I forgot you haven't come
to see me in some time.

02:18.177 --> 02:19.926
Zack.

02:21.113 --> 02:23.513
I want to help.

02:23.565 --> 02:25.932
You and I can figure
this out together.

02:25.984 --> 02:27.684
Dr. Brennan,
I know you're used to me

02:27.736 --> 02:29.469
being your assistant,

02:29.504 --> 02:31.938
always telling me
what to do.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.775
Today, the shoe is on
the other foot.

02:37.779 --> 02:40.180
Come on, come on.

02:40.215 --> 02:42.060
SAROYAN: Hey. Booth's on his
way back from the asylum,

02:42.084 --> 02:44.284
They have no clue
how Zack escaped.

02:44.336 --> 02:45.752
What have you got?

02:45.787 --> 02:47.954
So this is security footage

02:47.956 --> 02:49.623
from inside
the Jeffersonian.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.791
Now, because we were
on the phone with Brennan

02:51.843 --> 02:53.093
when it happened,

02:53.128 --> 02:55.095
we do know the exact
time she was taken.

02:56.031 --> 02:57.864
The problem is...

02:57.900 --> 02:59.132
Zack remotely
turned off

02:59.167 --> 03:00.300
some of the cameras.

03:00.302 --> 03:01.968
It was only
for a short interval,

03:01.970 --> 03:04.187
<i>but it... it was enough</i>
<i>to give him a...</i>

03:04.223 --> 03:05.639
a very clear path.

03:05.691 --> 03:07.140
Wait, what about footage of them

03:07.192 --> 03:08.725
exiting the building?

03:08.777 --> 03:10.088
That's what doesn't
make any sense.

03:10.112 --> 03:11.311
I haven't found

03:11.313 --> 03:12.479
any exterior cameras

03:12.481 --> 03:13.780
that have been turned off.

03:13.815 --> 03:15.315
Which means they can
still be somewhere

03:15.317 --> 03:16.983
within the Jeffersonian.

03:23.375 --> 03:24.491
Okay.

03:24.543 --> 03:25.709
I got Dr. Brennan's
field bag.

03:25.744 --> 03:26.960
Just dump it out
for me, okay?

03:26.995 --> 03:28.461
Come on, Wendell,
hurry up.

03:29.915 --> 03:31.047
What are we
looking for, man?

03:31.083 --> 03:33.216
I'll tell you when I see it.

03:33.252 --> 03:35.468
Come on, where is it?

03:35.504 --> 03:37.170
Got it.
Hand lotion?

03:37.172 --> 03:38.338
Not just any hand lotion.

03:38.390 --> 03:39.756
This stuff has got
glycerin in it.

03:39.808 --> 03:41.057
What is that thing?
This?

03:41.093 --> 03:42.892
It's an explosive
trace detector.

03:42.928 --> 03:45.095
Now, I am reprogramming it.

03:45.147 --> 03:48.148
Normally, you would actually
screen the glycerin out

03:48.183 --> 03:49.577
so you don't end up
with a false positive,

03:49.601 --> 03:51.184
but I am actually changing it

03:51.186 --> 03:52.569
to screen the glycerin in.

03:52.604 --> 03:54.321
Then we can track her down.

03:54.356 --> 03:55.655
It's like a
digital bloodhound.

03:55.691 --> 03:57.524
Yeah, you got it.

03:58.694 --> 03:59.859
Bingo. Okay.

03:59.911 --> 04:02.529
Let's take this
hound for a walk.

04:04.199 --> 04:05.865
Okay, so Dr. Brennan
was in here,

04:05.917 --> 04:07.784
examining the remains
when Zack took her.

04:07.836 --> 04:09.085
All right then.

04:09.121 --> 04:11.037
Let's see what we can smell.
Or...

04:11.039 --> 04:12.255
you know what I mean.

04:12.291 --> 04:14.040
Get me to that phone.

04:14.042 --> 04:15.208
Okay.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.875
(machine beeping)

04:22.217 --> 04:24.517
Nothing.

04:24.553 --> 04:25.769
Take me to the table.

04:25.804 --> 04:27.020
Okay.

04:27.055 --> 04:29.389
Slow, slow, slow.

04:30.309 --> 04:33.226
(machine beeping)

04:33.228 --> 04:35.362
Come on, Dr. B, where are you?

04:36.481 --> 04:39.115
W-w-wait, wait, wait.

04:39.151 --> 04:40.400
(machine beeping faster)

04:40.452 --> 04:41.901
You did it, man.

04:41.953 --> 04:43.737
Call Booth right now.

04:43.739 --> 04:45.822
It's faint, but I got her.

04:45.874 --> 04:49.075
Booth, this is as far as
I could track her and even here

04:49.077 --> 04:50.410
the glycerin is
almost nonexistent.

04:50.412 --> 04:51.745
Look, where's this elevator go?

04:51.747 --> 04:52.879
Basement and five floors up.

04:52.914 --> 04:54.748
I say we start at the top,
work our way down.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.383
Or maybe not.
He's in the basement.

04:56.418 --> 04:57.417
How do you know?

04:57.419 --> 04:58.585
It's Zack.
Trust me.

04:58.587 --> 04:59.969
Okay? You understand?

05:00.005 --> 05:01.554
It's the only place
he would take her.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:29.117 --> 05:31.251
(gate creaks)

05:37.175 --> 05:38.958
BRENNAN: Zack, you don't
have to do this.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.293
Stop.
Listen to me.

05:40.295 --> 05:41.761
ADDY:
No, I'm done listening.

05:41.797 --> 05:43.441
BRENNAN: Put it down now!
Zack, put the syringe down now.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.131
I'm gonna count to three.
One...

05:45.183 --> 05:46.716
Agent Booth.
Two...

05:46.768 --> 05:48.164
I need a moment
so I can talk.

05:48.188 --> 05:49.103
Three.

05:49.104 --> 05:49.756
No, Booth!

05:49.780 --> 05:50.471
Bones, what the hell
are you doing?

05:50.472 --> 05:51.721
Get out of the way.
No, Booth,

05:51.773 --> 05:53.106
you don't understand.
The syringe,

05:53.141 --> 05:54.474
he wasn't going
to use it on me.

05:54.526 --> 05:55.837
What the hell
are you talking about?

05:55.861 --> 05:57.143
Dr. Brennan is telling
the truth.

05:57.145 --> 05:58.445
My plan was to inject myself.

05:58.480 --> 05:59.979
This is sodium thiopental.

06:00.031 --> 06:01.197
Truth serum.

06:01.233 --> 06:03.116
I need Dr. Brennan
to believe me.

06:03.151 --> 06:04.868
I didn't kill anyone.

Dr. Saroyan, hey.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.200
You sure you want
to be out here?

07:20.202 --> 07:21.534
Yeah, I...

07:21.536 --> 07:23.536
Dr. Brennan's safe, so...

I just...

07:25.340 --> 07:26.589
(Saroyan sighs)

07:26.625 --> 07:29.759
I needed to see him
with my own eyes.

07:29.794 --> 07:31.544
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

07:31.596 --> 07:34.214
I mean, I never knew Zack,

07:34.266 --> 07:36.299
not like you guys, but...

07:36.351 --> 07:40.854
still, I don't know,
just... looking at him...

07:40.889 --> 07:43.606
You would think he was
as harmless as a child.

07:43.642 --> 07:46.192
That's what we all
thought the last time.

07:47.562 --> 07:49.896
So what do you think
made him crack?

07:49.948 --> 07:53.449
I mean, that lobbyist he killed,
that was like ten years ago.

08:01.993 --> 08:03.688
Just get your stuff, I'm gonna
take you to go see the doctor.

08:03.712 --> 08:05.389
No... what? No, I'm fine.
Nothing is wrong with me.

08:05.413 --> 08:06.412
What are you talking
about, "fine"?

08:06.414 --> 08:07.330
Nothing's wrong with you?

08:07.382 --> 08:09.415
You just said
maybe Zack didn't do it.

08:09.467 --> 08:11.251
I need to go home
to see Christine and...

08:11.253 --> 08:12.669
Listen,
the kids are fine.

08:12.721 --> 08:13.731
Do you understand me?
They are safe.

08:13.755 --> 08:15.221
Okay?
I need to see them.

08:15.257 --> 08:16.472
Trust me,
you need to just...

08:16.508 --> 08:18.007
calm down, all right?

08:18.059 --> 08:20.426
Just calm down.

08:20.478 --> 08:21.728
All right?

08:21.763 --> 08:23.813
Look, Zack...
did this.

08:23.848 --> 08:25.098
Do you understand me?
You had nightmares

08:25.100 --> 08:27.166
about a guy with burned hands.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.401
I am well aware of that,

08:28.436 --> 08:30.153
Booth.
I had nightmares

08:30.188 --> 08:31.437
because of evidence that

08:31.489 --> 08:32.938
insinuated Zack.
(shouts)

08:32.941 --> 08:34.501
Innocent people don't escape
from sanitariums

08:34.525 --> 08:35.775
to proclaim their innocence!

08:35.777 --> 08:37.193
You're right.

08:37.245 --> 08:39.779
What Zack did is
completely illogical,

08:39.831 --> 08:41.780
I know, but I still...
I need to...

08:41.783 --> 08:43.198
No! No, this
is not right.

08:43.251 --> 08:44.679
There is no other way
of looking at this.

08:44.703 --> 08:46.286
Zack is a convicted murderer.

08:46.338 --> 08:47.503
He tried to kidnap you.

08:47.539 --> 08:49.122
And he wanted to kill you.

08:49.124 --> 08:50.957
Then why didn't he?

08:50.959 --> 08:53.960
He could have killed
me at any time,

08:53.962 --> 08:55.795
but he didn't.

08:55.797 --> 08:57.463
I need to talk to him.
I need to know...

08:57.465 --> 08:58.932
Bones, stop talking.

08:58.967 --> 09:00.950
All right, just...

09:00.986 --> 09:02.885
stop talking.
I love you, too.

09:02.921 --> 09:04.304
Please.
(chuckles)

09:04.306 --> 09:06.189
Stop talking.

09:06.224 --> 09:08.391
Hey, Hodgins, slow down, man.
Talk to me.

09:08.443 --> 09:09.503
I can see that you're upset.

09:09.527 --> 09:10.977
I'm telling you,
if I had been

09:10.979 --> 09:13.529
in that basement, this needle
here wouldn't be in evidence.

09:13.565 --> 09:15.648
Nope. I would've shoved
it down his throat,

09:15.700 --> 09:17.378
made sure it punctured every one
of his organs on the way down.

09:17.402 --> 09:19.485
That's... creative.

09:19.537 --> 09:20.653
Oh, damn it.

09:20.655 --> 09:22.622
Oh, damn it.
Aah!

09:22.657 --> 09:23.990
Damn it!
Oh, Hodgins, hey, hey, hey.

09:23.992 --> 09:25.269
It's all right.
It's okay. (groaning)

09:25.293 --> 09:26.659
It's just another spasm.
I got you. I got you.

09:26.661 --> 09:27.827
I got you.

09:27.829 --> 09:29.796
You're okay.
(groans)

09:29.831 --> 09:31.164
Okay.
Okay.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.499
Trust me, this pain is nothing

09:33.551 --> 09:35.835
compared to how
I'm feeling here, man.

09:35.837 --> 09:37.003
(groans)

09:37.055 --> 09:38.671
Hang on.

09:38.673 --> 09:41.007
(panting)

09:41.059 --> 09:42.308
Here. Here, here, here.

09:42.344 --> 09:43.343
I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

09:43.345 --> 09:44.510
No, no, just take on of these

09:44.512 --> 09:45.678
for the pain, all right?

09:51.486 --> 09:52.747
You really think Zack
was gonna kill her,

09:52.771 --> 09:54.220
don't you?

09:55.607 --> 09:58.191
No doubt whatsoever.

10:00.528 --> 10:02.745
But what about
the sodium thiopental?

10:02.781 --> 10:05.331
Truth serum?

10:05.367 --> 10:07.533
Come on, Wendell,
don't even go there.

10:07.585 --> 10:10.620
Hey, I'm-I'm sure
you're right, all right,

10:10.672 --> 10:13.589
but you don't think it's...
at least a possibility

10:13.625 --> 10:14.924
that he's telling the truth?

10:14.959 --> 10:17.210
I mean, maybe it
was someone else.

10:17.262 --> 10:18.939
I mean, we-we know this killer
is manipulative.

10:18.963 --> 10:21.047
Stop it.
Listen to me.

10:21.049 --> 10:24.100
Zack is guilty, end of story.

10:25.470 --> 10:28.271
Dr. Brennan, oh, wow,
it's so good to see you.

10:28.306 --> 10:29.856
Oh, okay.
Thank you.

10:29.891 --> 10:31.891
So much hugging.

10:31.893 --> 10:33.393
Perhaps I should be
kidnapped more often.

10:33.395 --> 10:34.694
No.
No.

10:34.729 --> 10:35.945
How are the kids?
They're fine.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.196
And clueless.

10:37.232 --> 10:38.865
My dad is taking
such good care of them,

10:38.900 --> 10:41.484
they had no idea I was missing,
which is a good thing.

10:41.536 --> 10:44.704
Right, uh, well, Booth,
Dr. Brennan, this is

10:44.739 --> 10:46.289
Dr. Roshan.
He is the head

10:46.324 --> 10:48.574
of the facility where Zack
was institutionalized.

10:48.626 --> 10:50.076
Dr. Roshan, thank you
so much for being here.

10:50.078 --> 10:51.294
Do you have any idea

10:51.329 --> 10:52.912
how Zack managed to escape?

10:52.964 --> 10:54.130
Uh, not yet.

10:54.165 --> 10:55.915
Unfortunately,
as you are aware,

10:55.967 --> 10:57.417
Zack is a very
intelligent

10:57.419 --> 10:58.418
young man.

10:58.420 --> 10:59.919
BOOTH:
Right. And the box here.

10:59.971 --> 11:01.365
Right? I'm assuming
that this is Zack Addy's

11:01.389 --> 11:03.222
personal effects?
Yes, I...

11:03.258 --> 11:04.318
thought you might want
to see these.

11:04.342 --> 11:05.808
The photographs,

11:05.844 --> 11:07.427
some press clippings...

11:07.479 --> 11:10.313
As you can see, he was very fond
of you, Dr. Brennan.

11:10.348 --> 11:12.565
I am relieved to see
that you were not harmed.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.267
Unfortunately,
three other victims

11:14.269 --> 11:15.568
weren't so lucky, Doctor.

11:15.603 --> 11:16.936
AUBREY:
Allison Monroe,

11:16.938 --> 11:17.987
Douglas Burkhart

11:18.022 --> 11:19.522
and Melissa Goodman.
Each of them

11:19.574 --> 11:20.733
were killed six months apart.

11:20.757 --> 11:21.525
ROSHAN: Wait.

11:21.526 --> 11:23.576
I'm sorry,
are you implying that Zack

11:23.611 --> 11:26.075
was leaving our facility at will
for over a year?

11:26.099 --> 11:26.780
No.

11:26.781 --> 11:28.915
We are not
implying anything.

11:28.950 --> 11:31.367
These are stills from
a surveillance camera

11:31.419 --> 11:33.953
half a block away
from your facility.

11:33.955 --> 11:37.123
That one is from six months ago.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.878
ROSHAN: Then...

11:38.902 --> 11:40.043
To tell the truth,
we don't know how long

11:40.044 --> 11:42.261
he's been coming and going.

11:42.297 --> 11:44.263
Dr. Roshan,
I have to ask.

11:44.299 --> 11:46.215
I noticed that
Zack had a scar

11:46.267 --> 11:48.468
across his forehead, almost
like he'd had a surgery,

11:48.470 --> 11:49.407
like a lobotomy.

11:49.431 --> 11:52.673
No. Zack's scar didn't occur
because of any procedure.

11:52.674 --> 11:54.194
BOOTH: Okay,
then what happened to him?

11:54.224 --> 11:56.007
Zack was receiving

11:56.009 --> 11:58.510
regular visits
from an associate of yours,

11:58.512 --> 12:01.680
a psychologist named Dr. Sweets.

12:01.732 --> 12:04.132
They... they were seeing
each other almost every week.

12:04.168 --> 12:05.567
But, then,
when Dr. Sweets

12:05.602 --> 12:07.252
was murdered,
Zack had trouble processing.

12:07.287 --> 12:10.438
He threw himself
into a fit of rage

12:10.491 --> 12:12.691
and that's when he self-injured.

12:12.693 --> 12:15.827
Since then,
Zack has been different.

12:15.863 --> 12:18.029
Withdrawn, I think,
is the...

12:18.081 --> 12:20.248
best way to describe him.

12:21.752 --> 12:23.702
Listen, Booth,
why don't you, uh...

12:23.704 --> 12:25.461
why don't you let me have
the first crack at him?

12:25.485 --> 12:27.256
BRENNAN: No.

12:27.257 --> 12:29.774
I'm the one Zack wanted to see;
I should be present.

12:29.810 --> 12:31.543
BOOTH:
No. Aubrey's right.

12:31.595 --> 12:33.328
Zack wants you,
which is the last thing

12:33.363 --> 12:34.930
that we should give him.

12:37.050 --> 12:39.801
(Booth sighs heavily)

12:39.853 --> 12:42.938
Dr. Addy, hello. My name is
Special Agent James Aubrey.

12:42.973 --> 12:44.472
As you can imagine,

12:44.508 --> 12:46.641
I've got quite a few questions
to ask you.

12:46.693 --> 12:49.227
No. I would prefer
to only speak with Dr. Brennan.

12:49.229 --> 12:51.596
Communicating with someone
of lesser intellect

12:51.632 --> 12:53.365
is difficult for me.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.534
No offense taken.

12:58.372 --> 13:01.072
Now, Zack, you, uh,
you told Dr. Brennan

13:01.124 --> 13:02.724
that you were innocent.

13:02.759 --> 13:04.743
I <i>am</i> innocent.

13:04.795 --> 13:08.079
Look, ask him if he's
innocent of the kidnapping.

13:08.081 --> 13:09.631
So...

13:09.666 --> 13:12.467
you're denying that you
kidnapped Dr. Brennan?

13:12.502 --> 13:15.670
The escape and kidnapping
were necessary evils.

13:15.722 --> 13:17.856
I knew her life was in danger.

13:17.891 --> 13:20.508
So why didn't you just
call her up and tell her?

13:20.561 --> 13:22.711
I am not well versed
in social etiquette.

13:22.746 --> 13:24.930
But I believe, when
dealing with accusations

13:24.982 --> 13:28.400
of serial murder,
it is best to meet face to face.

13:28.435 --> 13:30.652
Look, ask him how he even knows
about the killer.

13:30.687 --> 13:32.153
There's nothing in the press.

13:32.189 --> 13:34.272
Zack, why don't you
help me out here.

13:34.324 --> 13:37.576
If you're not responsible,
as you say,

13:37.611 --> 13:41.329
then how do you even know
about this supposed killer?

13:41.365 --> 13:44.499
Because I've been reading
Dr. Brennan's e-mails.

13:44.534 --> 13:46.284
Given the evidence,
it was only

13:46.286 --> 13:49.120
a matter of time until I was
considered the prime suspect.

13:49.172 --> 13:53.792
AUBREY: Wait. You've been reading
Dr. Brennan's e-mail? How?

13:53.794 --> 13:56.211
ADDY: I hope you appreciate
I'm being forthright.

13:56.263 --> 13:58.046
Honesty, I'm told,
is the best policy.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.965
Although,
from the look on your face,

14:00.017 --> 14:02.801
I'm not sure
that axiom holds true.

14:02.803 --> 14:04.636
For the past
several years,

14:04.638 --> 14:06.988
I've been allowing myself
free time at night

14:07.024 --> 14:08.974
outside the sanitarium.

14:09.026 --> 14:10.842
AUBREY: You've been breaking out?
Yes.

14:10.877 --> 14:13.945
And then "breaking"
into the local library in order

14:13.981 --> 14:16.548
to read and also to access
their computers

14:16.583 --> 14:19.317
so I can keep up-to-date with
all my friends and colleagues.

14:19.369 --> 14:21.987
Dr. Brennan, Hodgins, Angela,

14:22.039 --> 14:23.822
and Dr. Saroyan.

14:23.874 --> 14:27.742
Zack, you've been spying
on all of their e-mail accounts?

14:27.794 --> 14:30.629
I do not care
for the word "spy."

14:30.664 --> 14:32.781
But, yes,
I've been keeping myself abreast

14:32.816 --> 14:34.049
of what they've been doing

14:34.084 --> 14:36.251
on a day-to-day basis.

14:36.303 --> 14:41.373
Let me ask you, you mentioned
everyone at the Jeffersonian.

14:41.408 --> 14:43.224
What about Agent Booth?

14:43.260 --> 14:45.994
You been spying on him, too?
No.

14:46.029 --> 14:48.146
Agent Booth and I
are not friends.

14:49.566 --> 14:52.350
So, how did you feel

14:52.352 --> 14:55.987
about Agent Booth
marrying Dr. Brennan

14:56.023 --> 14:59.357
and then having two children
with her?

15:03.697 --> 15:06.314
(sighs)

15:13.436 --> 15:15.902
Hey. Is this the computer
from the library?

15:15.926 --> 15:17.917
The one Zack was using
to check in on us?

15:17.941 --> 15:19.754
Yeah. Look at this.

15:21.018 --> 15:22.517
So, this is his account.

15:23.249 --> 15:25.699
Check out the subfolders.

15:25.701 --> 15:29.086
Unbelievable. So he had access
to all my e-mails?

15:29.121 --> 15:30.387
Yep.

15:30.423 --> 15:32.222
I have to say though,
he did show

15:32.258 --> 15:33.707
some sense of discretion.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.843
He didn't open any of
the photo attachments

15:35.878 --> 15:38.462
between Hodgins and me.

15:38.514 --> 15:42.483
Not that you and Arastoo
do that. Or... do you?

15:42.518 --> 15:43.717
We do not.

15:43.769 --> 15:47.254
Not over e-mail.

15:48.591 --> 15:52.726
Angela,
what is that untitled folder?

15:52.778 --> 15:54.211
Let me check it out.

15:56.565 --> 15:58.849
SAROYAN:
Dr. Alexander Bancroft.

15:58.884 --> 16:00.901
Why does that name
sound so familiar?

16:00.953 --> 16:02.569
Oh, my God.

16:02.571 --> 16:05.873
Um... this has to be a mistake.

16:07.126 --> 16:08.992
(sighs)
So, this puppet show from hell

16:09.044 --> 16:11.411
is everything probative we found
in Graham Reynolds' basement.

16:11.413 --> 16:13.580
As you can see, there's
blood trace on the drill bit

16:13.582 --> 16:15.582
and spindle as well.
Dr. Saroyan's in the process

16:15.634 --> 16:17.279
of matching the blood
to each of the victims.

16:17.303 --> 16:19.253
Also, over here,
I've got sodium sulfide,

16:19.255 --> 16:21.305
calcium hydrosulfide,
and dimethylamine--

16:21.340 --> 16:22.890
everything you need
to tan a body.

16:22.925 --> 16:24.925
What about osteological evidence?
In the basement,

16:24.977 --> 16:27.322
we found some bone shards on
the floor, most likely cast off

16:27.346 --> 16:28.929
when the killer drilled
holes into his victims.

16:28.931 --> 16:30.764
I'm still in the process
of matching the shards

16:30.766 --> 16:33.767
to each of them.
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

16:33.769 --> 16:36.270
Can I talk to you for a minute?
HODGINS: All right, yeah.

16:36.322 --> 16:38.166
No, say what you got to say. I
just... I'm gonna keep working.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.741
'Cause I'm not gonna stop until
we get what we need to convict.

16:41.744 --> 16:43.677
On the computer Zack was using,

16:43.712 --> 16:45.863
I... found that

16:45.915 --> 16:49.116
he was not only reading
our e-mails but that

16:49.118 --> 16:50.701
he also set up a dummy account

16:50.753 --> 16:53.120
under another name.

16:53.122 --> 16:56.123
Dr. Alexander Bancroft.

16:58.611 --> 16:59.843
BRENNAN:
I'm sorry,

16:59.879 --> 17:00.794
I don't understand.

17:00.846 --> 17:02.296
Who is Dr. Bancroft?

17:02.298 --> 17:03.630
BRAY: Wait, this is who
you were telling me about.

17:03.632 --> 17:05.549
Bancroft is a
world-renowned neurosurgeon.

17:05.601 --> 17:06.778
He's the one
that your physical therapist

17:06.801 --> 17:08.234
has been consulting with.

17:08.270 --> 17:09.936
He's the one
who developed the protocol

17:09.972 --> 17:13.272
that restored feeling
in Hodgins' legs.

17:13.309 --> 17:16.859
I'm not following. What does
this have to do with Zack?

17:16.896 --> 17:21.315
Dr. Bancroft never actually
spoke to Hodgins' therapist.

17:21.367 --> 17:22.983
It was Zack,

17:23.035 --> 17:25.536
e-mailing and calling
on a burner cell.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.820
Zack is the one
who developed the protocol

17:27.823 --> 17:29.673
that you've been following.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.491
Zack is the one
who's going to make it

17:31.544 --> 17:35.662
so that Hodgins
can walk.

17:35.664 --> 17:38.382
Look, Aubrey, okay, I'm not
saying that Zack didn't do it.

17:38.417 --> 17:41.051
All I'm saying is what he did
for Hodgins is nice.

17:41.086 --> 17:42.152
That's all. Yeah.

17:42.176 --> 17:43.555
Nice? Nice? I mean, you
realize we're talking

17:43.556 --> 17:45.147
about the person who
kidnapped your wife here.

17:45.171 --> 17:46.341
I get all that, okay?

17:46.342 --> 17:49.343
But... he's trying
to help Hodgins walk.

17:49.345 --> 17:51.261
I mean, that's nice
when you think about it.

17:51.313 --> 17:53.291
Doesn't make him innocent.
I mean, I'm sure Norman Bates

17:53.315 --> 17:55.315
was nice, at least when
it came to his mother.

17:55.351 --> 17:58.018
Besides, I mean, look at our
board. Look at the killer's M.O.

17:58.070 --> 18:00.270
First, he kills his victims
as humanely as possible,

18:00.322 --> 18:01.989
takes care of them
for six months,

18:02.024 --> 18:03.924
and then brutally
kills them again.

18:03.948 --> 18:04.692
I get it, Aubrey.

18:04.693 --> 18:06.026
You know what, it-it fits.

18:06.028 --> 18:08.695
I mean, and Zack here, you know?

18:09.782 --> 18:11.582
Being kind to Hodgins and...
(sighs)

18:11.617 --> 18:13.951
AUBREY: You're not convinced.
I just want

18:14.003 --> 18:15.680
some outside help on this.
Call Behavioral Analysis.

18:15.704 --> 18:17.588
See if there's
a profiler available.

18:17.623 --> 18:20.173
Um, I think maybe I could
be of some help with that.

18:20.209 --> 18:22.676
Karen, what are you doing here?
I thought you got transferred

18:22.711 --> 18:24.378
to Kansas City.
Yes,

18:24.430 --> 18:27.297
I was transferred. But then
I left, and now I'm back.

18:27.349 --> 18:28.882
As is self-evident.

18:28.884 --> 18:31.101
So...

18:31.136 --> 18:34.805
anything new going on?

18:39.945 --> 18:43.113
Dr. Brennan, I wanted to let you
know that I've identified

18:43.148 --> 18:45.399
the bone shards we found
in the puppeteer's basement.

18:45.434 --> 18:48.118
Did all the fragments belong
to our previous victims?

18:48.153 --> 18:49.786
Yes. Based on the texture
and color,

18:49.822 --> 18:51.872
I was able to ascribe
the majority of the fragments

18:51.907 --> 18:54.241
to Melissa Goodman,
the most recent victim.

18:54.243 --> 18:57.744
What about any evidence
that could possibly exonerate

18:57.746 --> 19:01.081
or... convict Dr. Addy?

19:01.116 --> 19:02.899
No.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.451
I didn't find any such evidence.

19:04.486 --> 19:07.054
Nor was I looking for any.
You always taught me

19:07.089 --> 19:09.423
to examine the evidence
without any preconceived bias.

19:09.425 --> 19:10.724
And unless you say otherwise,

19:10.759 --> 19:13.343
that is what
I'm gonna continue to do.

19:14.596 --> 19:16.480
Mr. Bray, i-if you would,

19:16.515 --> 19:18.815
I could use
an extra set of eyes.

19:20.903 --> 19:24.137
While performing a
histological examination

19:24.173 --> 19:25.922
on this chipped fragment

19:25.958 --> 19:28.492
of a central incisor,
I found something of note.

19:28.527 --> 19:32.079
This piece of tooth
shows tetracycline banding.

19:32.114 --> 19:34.013
Evidence that the victim took
antibiotics before age eight.

19:34.037 --> 19:35.116
Right,

19:35.117 --> 19:37.095
but I've already examined all
three victims, and this banding

19:37.119 --> 19:38.373
wasn't present
in any of their teeth.

19:38.397 --> 19:39.620
I concur.

19:39.621 --> 19:44.875
Which means this fragment
came from a fourth victim.

19:44.927 --> 19:48.795
Okay. No. But here...

19:48.847 --> 19:49.796
You know what?

19:49.798 --> 19:51.631
What?
No. Oh.

19:51.633 --> 19:52.966
If it was latent, it could be...

19:53.018 --> 19:55.185
I'm just gonna orange Post-it.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.937
Move this
guy here

19:56.972 --> 20:00.140
and here. And then I can...
Yellow. Uh,

20:00.192 --> 20:01.975
green.

20:01.977 --> 20:03.643
I got it. I got it.

20:04.446 --> 20:05.779
Wow. What'd you get?

20:05.814 --> 20:08.148
I got it.
What?

20:08.200 --> 20:09.816
Dissociative identity disorder.

20:09.818 --> 20:11.818
Multiple personalities?
Yes.

20:11.820 --> 20:14.488
Think about it. Think about the
way the bodies were disposed of.

20:14.490 --> 20:15.337
I mean,
they weren't hidden at all.

20:15.361 --> 20:16.615
He wants us to find them.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.824
It would suggest
he wants

20:17.876 --> 20:18.709
to get caught.

20:18.744 --> 20:19.971
Yes, but then he keeps killing.

20:19.995 --> 20:22.162
Two personalities in conflict.
Wait a second,

20:22.214 --> 20:24.831
does Zack fit that profile?
Well, yes.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.383
Uh, well, and-and no.

20:26.418 --> 20:28.585
Although Dr. Addy's
never been diagnosed with

20:28.637 --> 20:30.982
dissociative identity disorder,
it could have been brought on

20:31.006 --> 20:32.033
by the trauma to his head.

20:32.057 --> 20:33.173
But wouldn't he be aware

20:33.225 --> 20:34.508
of this other personality?

20:34.510 --> 20:35.510
Not necessarily.

20:35.561 --> 20:36.860
Memory loss is a symptom

20:36.895 --> 20:38.345
of this condition.
So one personality

20:38.397 --> 20:41.681
isn't cognizant
of what the other is doing.

20:41.683 --> 20:43.683
What about Dr. Faulk?
You still think

20:43.719 --> 20:44.684
he could've done it?
I think that

20:44.686 --> 20:45.714
he is an excellent suspect.

20:45.738 --> 20:46.770
Think about it.

20:46.822 --> 20:48.166
His parents were murdered
when he was

20:48.190 --> 20:49.990
seven years old.
That's exactly the kind

20:50.025 --> 20:52.275
of trauma
that brings on D.I.D. Plus,

20:52.327 --> 20:54.172
he's a psychiatrist, and, in
general, they tend to be like...

20:54.196 --> 20:56.196
(squawking sound)
You know what I mean?

20:56.198 --> 20:57.842
Yeah, we're aware of the type.
(phone ringing)

20:57.866 --> 21:00.083
Get an agent on Faulk
right away, all right?

21:00.119 --> 21:01.868
I want to know where he's at at
all times. Get someone outside

21:01.870 --> 21:03.481
of his house.
I don't care where they are.

21:03.505 --> 21:05.705
Find him.
Hello. Booth.

21:05.707 --> 21:07.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Cam, slow down.

21:07.793 --> 21:09.042
What is it?

21:10.012 --> 21:11.261
Slow down.

21:11.296 --> 21:13.380
What do you mean Bones is gone?

21:22.024 --> 21:25.225
Whoa. This is even (phone ringing)
creepier than I imagined.

21:25.277 --> 21:28.195
Oh, sorry.
Uh, this is Booth on the phone.

21:28.230 --> 21:30.304
Why don't you take the wall
by the windows?

21:30.305 --> 21:31.529
Okay.

21:31.533 --> 21:32.983
Hello, Booth?

21:33.035 --> 21:34.951
Bones, what the hell
is going on? Where are you?

21:34.987 --> 21:36.620
I'm in
Graham Reynolds' basement.

21:36.655 --> 21:38.905
No, no, no. You can't do that.

21:38.907 --> 21:40.435
You don't... you don't
just leave without telling me

21:40.459 --> 21:42.409
or Cam.

21:42.411 --> 21:44.411
I wasn't aware
I needed permission.

21:44.413 --> 21:46.963
You don't. Except, of course,
the day after you get kidnapped.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.215
I'm coming to get you.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.917
No, Booth, I assure you,
we are safe.

21:50.969 --> 21:52.969
In all likelihood,
Zack is the responsible party,

21:53.005 --> 21:55.172
and he is in custody.

21:55.224 --> 21:57.474
Bones, listen to me.
Get out of there right now.

21:57.509 --> 21:59.309
Booth, I promise
I'm fine.

21:59.344 --> 22:01.511
Nothing is going
to happen.

22:01.563 --> 22:03.814
I'm at a crime scene.
It's secure.

22:03.849 --> 22:05.098
Dr. Brennan.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.100
Hold on. No, Booth,
you don't understand.

22:07.102 --> 22:08.935
I found a tooth fragment
that doesn't belong

22:08.937 --> 22:11.271
to any of the victims.
What are you talking about?

22:11.273 --> 22:13.573
There's a fourth victim?
Yes.

22:13.609 --> 22:15.408
Listen, Bones,
do me a favor.

22:15.444 --> 22:16.754
Just get out
of the basement right now.

22:16.778 --> 22:18.328
Will you listen
to me for once?

22:18.363 --> 22:19.674
Booth, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

22:19.698 --> 22:21.248
Hold on. Hold on!

22:21.283 --> 22:22.949
BOOTH:
Geez, Bones...

22:25.337 --> 22:26.620
(grunts)

22:26.622 --> 22:29.956
(banging)

22:30.008 --> 22:32.292
Wendell?
Are you okay, Wendell?

22:32.344 --> 22:33.521
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

22:33.545 --> 22:34.961
Wendell.

22:34.963 --> 22:36.429
Hey, sorry, Dr. B.

22:36.465 --> 22:38.131
I slipped trying
to open this door.

22:39.101 --> 22:40.467
Booth?
BOOTH: Are you okay?

22:40.469 --> 22:43.637
Yes, we're fine.
Mr. Bray found something

22:43.689 --> 22:46.106
It's some kind of hidden door.

22:46.141 --> 22:47.974
What do you mean, a door?
What's inside?

22:47.976 --> 22:49.643
Hold on.

22:57.369 --> 22:58.802
BOOTH:
Bones, are you there?

22:58.854 --> 23:00.804
Oh...

23:01.857 --> 23:04.808
Booth, it's
the other victim.

23:04.860 --> 23:07.994
Half of the body is missing.

23:12.049 --> 23:14.622
BRENNAN: The rounded
supraorbital margins suggest

23:14.623 --> 23:15.872
the victim was male.

23:15.873 --> 23:17.100
Also based on the
partially fused

23:17.124 --> 23:18.507
epiphyseal unions
of the humeri,

23:18.542 --> 23:20.175
it appears he was
still growing.

23:20.211 --> 23:22.060
The victim was
a teenager?

23:22.096 --> 23:23.607
That's not at all
consistent with the others.

23:23.631 --> 23:25.881
And he's missing
the entire

23:25.883 --> 23:27.416
lower half of his body.

23:27.451 --> 23:29.184
I'm just saying,

23:29.220 --> 23:31.436
in case you missed
that... little detail.

23:31.472 --> 23:32.854
The good news is

23:32.890 --> 23:35.774
there's just enough
tissue around the hair

23:35.809 --> 23:37.354
that I should be able
to run a tox screen.

23:37.378 --> 23:39.278
Dr. Brennan, take a look
at this exfoliation

23:39.313 --> 23:40.896
of the cortical bone.

23:40.898 --> 23:43.232
BRENNAN: It suggests
the victim was killed,

23:43.234 --> 23:46.618
I'd say, between ten
and 20 years ago.

23:46.654 --> 23:48.620
So that means
this victim

23:48.656 --> 23:50.489
predates the others.

23:50.541 --> 23:53.408
And that would mean
Zack was a teenager as well

23:53.410 --> 23:54.843
at time of death.

23:54.878 --> 23:57.963
Okay, I'll start
the facial reconstruction

23:57.998 --> 24:00.082
and see if I can find
anything in missing persons.

24:01.302 --> 24:02.718
What about cause
of death?

24:02.753 --> 24:04.253
Nothing
readily apparent,

24:04.305 --> 24:06.588
but look at the
inferior margin

24:06.590 --> 24:08.090
of the L4 vertebra.

24:08.142 --> 24:11.059
The striae suggests that it was
cut by some kind of saw.

24:11.095 --> 24:14.596
Dr. Hodgins, please swab
for particulate evidence.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.649
Dr. Hodgins?

24:17.685 --> 24:21.153
You're only now noticing
he's not here, aren't you?

24:21.188 --> 24:24.273
We couldn't stop him
from going.

24:26.360 --> 24:29.161
Zack, I've brought you
some visitors.

24:29.196 --> 24:30.512
Hodgins.

24:30.547 --> 24:32.331
This is unexpected.

24:33.851 --> 24:36.251
(door closes)
And Miss Delfs.

24:36.287 --> 24:38.253
It is a pleasure
to see you again.

24:38.289 --> 24:39.371
Oh, I'm...
(clears throat)

24:39.423 --> 24:40.589
flattered that
you remember.

24:40.624 --> 24:42.124
It was just so
many years ago.

24:42.126 --> 24:44.543
But, um, I was working
on my dissertation,

24:44.595 --> 24:46.378
and Zack was nice
enough to grant me

24:46.430 --> 24:47.679
a series of interviews.

24:47.715 --> 24:49.298
Miss Delfs was just
one of many

24:49.350 --> 24:50.682
who came to see me.

24:50.718 --> 24:52.634
It is odd,

24:52.686 --> 24:54.636
but being perceived
as a murderous cannibal

24:54.688 --> 24:56.972
does have some advantages.

24:57.024 --> 24:59.024
Okay, Dr. Lecter,

24:59.059 --> 25:00.359
why don't you
take a seat?

25:00.394 --> 25:01.943
Thanks.

25:01.979 --> 25:06.281
Dr. Hodgins here has got
some questions for you.

25:11.055 --> 25:12.821
Zack, look at me.

25:16.710 --> 25:19.711
Angela found the e-mails
that you sent.

25:19.747 --> 25:22.331
The ones in Dr. Bancroft's name.

25:24.802 --> 25:26.051
I see.

25:26.086 --> 25:28.503
You are right
to be angry with me.

25:28.505 --> 25:32.090
No, Zack, what you did...

25:32.126 --> 25:35.177
it was genius...
it worked.

25:35.179 --> 25:37.679
I have feeling
again in my legs.

25:37.681 --> 25:40.432
Hodgins, you should not
be thanking me.

25:40.484 --> 25:41.600
Why not?

25:41.635 --> 25:42.768
Is it because
you feel guilt

25:42.803 --> 25:44.736
for other things
that you've done?

25:44.772 --> 25:47.689
No, the reason Dr. Hodgins
should not be thanking me

25:47.691 --> 25:49.135
is because ultimately
the treatment is

25:49.159 --> 25:50.392
unlikely to work.

25:50.427 --> 25:52.244
But that's what I'm
telling you.

25:52.279 --> 25:54.413
It worked.
I have feeling.

25:54.448 --> 25:58.033
No, what you have is pain from
compromised nervous activity

25:58.035 --> 25:59.418
in the sacral plexus.

25:59.453 --> 26:03.271
The truth is you
only have a slim chance,

26:03.307 --> 26:06.458
less than one percent,
that you will regain mobility.

26:06.510 --> 26:09.428
So you don't think
that it's gonna work?

26:09.463 --> 26:11.847
(sighs)

26:15.302 --> 26:17.602
I have been told,

26:17.638 --> 26:20.222
although it has not
been proven scientifically,

26:20.224 --> 26:23.525
that hope can sometimes
have the power to heal.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.111
<i>Hope</i> is what I was
trying to give you.

26:26.146 --> 26:30.732
But my fear is...

26:30.734 --> 26:33.535
all I've brought you
is pain.

26:42.629 --> 26:44.546
Dr. Faulk?
Hello?

26:44.581 --> 26:46.381
Booth...
Hmm?

26:46.417 --> 26:47.999
I don't think he's here.
You think?

26:52.306 --> 26:53.555
Aubrey, it's Booth.

26:53.590 --> 26:55.118
I want you to put an
APB out on Dr. Faulk.

26:55.142 --> 26:56.925
FAULK:
Agent Booth...

26:56.927 --> 27:00.645
Dr. Brennan, it's good
to see you again.

27:00.681 --> 27:02.764
I'm glad to see
you're unharmed.

27:02.816 --> 27:05.350
Your husband, when...
when last we spoke,

27:05.402 --> 27:07.235
when he assaulted me,

27:07.271 --> 27:09.070
insisted that you were
in harm's way.

27:09.106 --> 27:10.772
We just need to ask you
a few questions,

27:10.774 --> 27:12.574
that's all, Dr. Faulk.

27:12.609 --> 27:13.670
Starting with
your relationship

27:13.694 --> 27:15.277
with Dr. Zack Addy.

27:15.279 --> 27:16.745
You knew him,
didn't you?

27:16.780 --> 27:19.164
Dr. Brennan,
are you aware that

27:19.199 --> 27:22.167
the average murderer
has an IQ of less than 90?

27:22.202 --> 27:24.419
To talk with one
whose IQ is double that

27:24.455 --> 27:26.705
is not an opportunity
you let pass by.

27:26.757 --> 27:28.290
So you don't think
that it's strange

27:28.292 --> 27:30.675
that you failed to mention
that you knew Dr. Addy?

27:30.711 --> 27:32.494
No.
No.

27:32.529 --> 27:34.691
No, what is strange is that
Dr. Brennan never equated Zack

27:34.715 --> 27:37.265
with the man
in her nightmare.

27:37.301 --> 27:39.468
Which could either
be denial,

27:39.520 --> 27:42.420
or you think Dr. Addy
is innocent.

27:44.975 --> 27:47.309
Officers, thank you
very much for coming.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.979
Please escort Agent Booth
and Dr. Brennan

27:50.981 --> 27:52.364
out of the building.

27:52.399 --> 27:54.282
I called them
as soon as you arrived.

27:54.318 --> 27:57.819
I have a restraining order
against Agent Booth

27:57.821 --> 27:59.037
for pulling his gun on me.

27:59.072 --> 28:00.155
BOOTH:
No.

28:00.207 --> 28:01.323
Uh-uh.

28:01.325 --> 28:02.791
We're not done here,
Doctor.

28:02.826 --> 28:07.112
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan,
a word of advice.

28:07.147 --> 28:09.481
The person you're searching for

28:09.516 --> 28:12.050
has a pathological
need for control.

28:12.085 --> 28:15.120
He, or she, will want

28:15.155 --> 28:17.672
to get as close
to you as possible, to...

28:17.724 --> 28:19.774
manipulate you.

28:19.810 --> 28:22.894
Steer your investigation.

28:26.099 --> 28:27.849
Be careful.

28:29.353 --> 28:30.902
Come on, Booth.

28:30.938 --> 28:33.021
Let's go.

28:45.889 --> 28:47.423
(knocks)
Hey, you got a sec?

28:47.447 --> 28:48.338
Yeah, what is it?

28:48.339 --> 28:49.656
Karen has an idea

28:49.657 --> 28:51.197
that she'd like to run by you.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.063
Ooh, thank you,
Agent Aubrey,

28:53.098 --> 28:55.265
for your enthusiasm--
you're a heck of a salesman.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.183
Yeah, what is it, Delfs?

28:56.235 --> 28:57.684
Just spit it out, will ya?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.436
I was just wondering
if you were open

28:59.488 --> 29:01.021
to having another
forensic anthropologist

29:01.023 --> 29:02.523
consult on the case.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.586
Booth, she wants to give Zack
access to the case file.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.693
No. No way.
Get out, both of you.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.899
KAREN: Okay, just-just think
about it for a minute.

29:07.923 --> 29:08.915
Out. Done. No. No. No.
No.

29:08.939 --> 29:10.915
Booth, just think about
this. Hear me out.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.699
There are two ways
this can go.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.201
Let's say Zack
is innocent.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.003
He takes a look,
doesn't find anything,

29:16.038 --> 29:18.839
or, better, he looks and finds
something that we missed.

29:18.874 --> 29:21.542
So you think he's innocent?

29:21.544 --> 29:23.043
Oh, no; he totally did it,

29:23.095 --> 29:24.689
which is why I want to confront
him with what he's done,

29:24.713 --> 29:26.046
because then, maybe...

29:26.098 --> 29:29.349
His other personality
will present itself.

29:30.386 --> 29:32.219
Look, I know
it's a long shot,

29:32.271 --> 29:34.438
but just... let
me talk to Zack.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.391
Okay? Let me be the one to
present him with the case file.

29:37.393 --> 29:38.725
Do it.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.061
Tell Zack the plan,
will you?

29:41.063 --> 29:42.946
Aubrey.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.626
Do me a favor, will you?
Contact the field office

29:44.650 --> 29:46.066
in Kansas City, all right?

29:46.118 --> 29:48.452
I want you to talk
to Delfs' supervisor.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.487
I want to find out
why she left.

29:54.510 --> 29:56.243
Here. Let me show
you what I found.

29:56.245 --> 29:57.878
After repositioning
the vertebrae,

29:57.913 --> 30:00.230
I saw that there were lateral
compression fractures

30:00.266 --> 30:02.299
along the L2, 3, and 4,

30:02.334 --> 30:04.968
with deterioration
of the articular facets.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.304
So he had severe scoliosis.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.424
Only I'm not seeing
any evidence of bone grafting,

30:10.476 --> 30:13.160
which means the poor guy didn't
have any corrective surgery.

30:13.195 --> 30:16.179
And what about the severing
in the spine?

30:16.231 --> 30:17.648
Any idea what kind of saw
was used?

30:17.683 --> 30:19.616
Within the wound,
I found traces

30:19.652 --> 30:21.768
of martensitic
stainless steel.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.453
That's surgical steel.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.105
Yeah.
Which means that

30:25.107 --> 30:27.524
his spine was most likely
severed with a surgical saw.

30:27.576 --> 30:30.777
That fits with my findings
as well.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.629
In the tissue, I found propofol,

30:32.665 --> 30:35.499
which suggests he died
on the operating table.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.452
Hey. I finished
my facial reconstruction.

30:38.454 --> 30:40.504
There were no matches
in missing persons

30:40.539 --> 30:42.372
or in any other database.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.458
So we've got nothing.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.182
(door opens)

30:52.217 --> 30:53.717
I wanted to see how Zack
was doing.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.135
Uh, it's been a couple of hours.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.165
He's been poring through
the evidence like a machine.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.805
So no admission of guilt?
KAREN: No.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.524
He's been nothing
but professional.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.526
Calm, collected;
all Dr. Jekyll.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.027
No sign of Mr. Hyde.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.479
I want to speak to him.

31:05.481 --> 31:07.364
No...
KAREN: Yes. - No.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.593
Yes. We need
to keep pushing Zack.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.628
Look, this is the
perfect opportunity.

31:09.652 --> 31:11.618
If it is him,

31:11.654 --> 31:13.098
this will help lure out
the alternate identity.

31:13.122 --> 31:14.454
What if it's not him?

31:14.490 --> 31:15.656
Well, then your wife

31:15.691 --> 31:16.918
will be in no danger whatsoever.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.241
Please, Booth.

31:18.293 --> 31:19.826
I-I need to do this.

31:19.828 --> 31:21.106
KAREN: Yes, just stick with me.
Bones, just...

31:21.130 --> 31:22.379
KAREN:
I like this part.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.282
(door opens)

31:25.317 --> 31:26.800
Dr. Brennan.

31:26.835 --> 31:28.752
It is so good to have you
joining me.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.171
It's been too long
since we have worked

31:31.173 --> 31:32.056
side by side.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.474
Zack, before we begin,
I just want

31:33.475 --> 31:35.142
to make sure that you've
had enough time

31:35.177 --> 31:36.432
to review all the evidence.

31:36.433 --> 31:37.835
You've seen the crime
scene photos, correct?

31:37.859 --> 31:38.646
Yes, thank you.

31:38.647 --> 31:39.896
I've had ample time.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.015
If Dr. Brennan and I
could proceed...

31:42.067 --> 31:43.850
Uh, yes. Just one
question before we start.

31:43.852 --> 31:46.019
I-I wondered...

31:46.071 --> 31:48.655
what you thought of my profile
of the killer.

31:48.691 --> 31:50.857
My opinion is immaterial.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.411
My expertise is in forensic
anthropology, not psychology.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.246
Yes, I know.
You know what?

31:56.281 --> 31:57.614
One more question... Sorry.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.267
Um, what about blackouts?

32:00.302 --> 32:03.787
Have you had any
in the last year?

32:08.310 --> 32:09.793
Zack.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.345
If you and I are going
to continue,

32:12.381 --> 32:14.765
you have to answer that.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.351
Yes.

32:18.387 --> 32:20.370
I admit I have had
lapses in memory,

32:20.406 --> 32:22.723
most likely due
to changes in my medication.

32:22.725 --> 32:24.274
<i>Now</i> may we continue?

32:24.309 --> 32:26.143
Oh, please.

32:27.796 --> 32:29.696
ADDY:
Dr. Brennan.

32:29.732 --> 32:31.064
If we could,

32:31.116 --> 32:33.400
I would like to start
with the third victim.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.986
Specifically,
on the right hand,

32:36.038 --> 32:37.738
you found longitudinal fractures

32:37.790 --> 32:40.123
of the second, third and fourth
proximal phalanges.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.492
The killer struggled
with this victim.

32:42.544 --> 32:43.910
Because he is physically weak.

32:43.912 --> 32:45.545
Now, look at the direct fracture

32:45.581 --> 32:48.131
along the base of the occipital.

32:49.752 --> 32:51.718
(knocking on door)

32:51.754 --> 32:53.386
Hey.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.590
AUBREY:
How are they doing?

32:56.592 --> 32:58.258
Uh, you know.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.390
I got nothing,
how about you?

32:59.414 --> 33:00.595
Well, I talked

33:00.596 --> 33:02.179
to Karen's supervisor
in Kansas City,

33:02.231 --> 33:04.264
a guy named Paul Crawford,
you know him?

33:04.266 --> 33:06.566
No, but let me guess,
nothing happened.

33:06.602 --> 33:08.151
Well, I wouldn't be
so sure.

33:08.187 --> 33:11.438
When I asked why Karen left,
Paul said-- and I quote--

33:11.440 --> 33:13.440
"legally," he couldn't comment.

33:13.442 --> 33:14.991
What does that mean?
I have no idea.

33:15.027 --> 33:16.660
I'm gonna keep
asking around, but

33:16.695 --> 33:18.840
in the meantime, you want me
to take Karen off the case?

33:18.864 --> 33:20.280
No, not yet.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.249
And also, I got Dr. Roshan
waiting for you.

33:22.284 --> 33:23.511
Apparently he's
got some suspects

33:23.535 --> 33:24.785
he wants you
to look at.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.953
Okay, bring
him in here.

33:29.374 --> 33:31.792
Doc.

33:31.844 --> 33:34.010
Agent Booth,
thank you for seeing me.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.129
I wanted you to have these
as soon as possible.

33:36.131 --> 33:37.347
What's this?

33:37.382 --> 33:38.799
The former inmates--

33:38.851 --> 33:40.433
each one of whom
spent considerable time

33:40.469 --> 33:41.935
with Dr. Addy,

33:41.970 --> 33:43.637
and each one
suffered from D.I.D.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.972
All right, Aubrey, do me
a favor-- get on this right away

33:46.024 --> 33:47.558
and see if you can
track them down. Thanks.

33:47.582 --> 33:48.359
Got it.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.309
(knocking)

33:49.361 --> 33:50.610
BOOTH & AUBREY:
Whoa!

33:53.482 --> 33:54.837
What's going on?

33:54.861 --> 33:56.861
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.202
We tried to get you over
the intercom, and then

33:59.238 --> 33:59.916
when you didn't come, I might
have kind of panicked.

33:59.940 --> 34:00.822
Relax, just breathe it out.

34:00.823 --> 34:02.322
Bones, what's going on?

34:02.324 --> 34:03.573
It's okay, Booth,
I'm fine.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.875
Zack?

34:05.794 --> 34:07.327
What have you done to him?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.161
He's okay.
Nothing happened,

34:09.164 --> 34:11.297
it's just that he...

34:13.302 --> 34:15.335
...we have come to a conclusion.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.391
Dr. Roshan, uh,

34:21.426 --> 34:23.677
i-if it is all right,

34:23.679 --> 34:26.847
I would very much like to return
to the institution.

34:26.849 --> 34:29.014
This time to maximum security.

34:31.186 --> 34:33.687
Wait, what the hell happened?
Brennan and Zack

34:33.739 --> 34:35.605
have reviewed
all the evidence, and although

34:35.641 --> 34:37.357
Zack doesn't
remember

34:37.409 --> 34:40.409
committing such crimes...
BRENNAN: He and I agree

34:40.445 --> 34:42.829
the evidence is conclusive.

34:42.864 --> 34:44.998
He's guilty.

34:51.246 --> 34:52.674
Booth, come on.
Let me take care of this.

34:52.697 --> 34:55.607
I can fill out the form, let me
drive him back to the asylum.

34:55.630 --> 34:57.237
I got it. I am fine. Okay?

34:57.261 --> 34:58.496
I do not get you,

34:58.520 --> 34:59.980
you know that?
I mean, all of the evidence

35:00.004 --> 35:01.754
points to Zack,
even he can't deny it,

35:01.756 --> 35:03.255
but now you don't think
that he did it.

35:03.257 --> 35:05.140
Look, it's...
It doesn't matter, okay?

35:05.176 --> 35:06.567
It's just a gut feeling,
that's all.

35:06.591 --> 35:07.260
Well,

35:07.261 --> 35:10.429
maybe your gut
needs a probiotic.

35:10.431 --> 35:11.992
It's a probiotic--
it's, like, a health thing.

35:12.016 --> 35:13.399
Stop. I got your point, okay?

35:13.434 --> 35:15.267
You think that Zack is guilty,

35:15.269 --> 35:17.603
but once again my gut is telling
me something else, all right?

35:17.605 --> 35:19.416
Once again? Hold on a second,
what are you saying?

35:19.440 --> 35:20.990
Are you saying
that you didn't think

35:21.025 --> 35:23.575
he was guilty the first
time with the lobbyist?

35:23.611 --> 35:25.077
I got to go.

35:28.866 --> 35:31.950
Ms. Delfs, for the
last time, I'm fine.

35:32.003 --> 35:33.502
Please stop following me.

35:33.537 --> 35:35.454
Well, Dr. Brennan,
I'm just trying to help.

35:35.506 --> 35:37.466
I really think that
after what happened with Zack,

35:37.508 --> 35:38.957
you need time to process.

35:38.959 --> 35:40.793
I would like you to leave.

35:40.795 --> 35:42.511
Dr. Brennan,

35:42.546 --> 35:44.630
you're not thinking rationally.

35:44.682 --> 35:47.466
I mean, what are you even
doing here? There's no more work

35:47.468 --> 35:49.018
to be done.

35:49.053 --> 35:50.886
You're safe, it's over.

35:50.938 --> 35:52.721
Stay away from me.

35:52.773 --> 35:55.224
Dr. Brennan.

35:55.276 --> 35:56.859
I think you need
to come with me.

35:56.894 --> 35:58.027
Let's find you a place

35:58.062 --> 35:59.728
to sit down.
No.

35:59.780 --> 36:01.563
Dr. Faulk warned us

36:01.615 --> 36:03.232
someone would insert themselves

36:03.284 --> 36:05.984
into the case, manipulate it.

36:06.037 --> 36:08.070
That the killer
would need to feel in control.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.371
The ki...

36:09.407 --> 36:10.956
Oh... (laughs)

36:10.991 --> 36:12.741
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

36:12.793 --> 36:15.267
I need to know why
you left your last job.

36:15.291 --> 36:16.246
Uh,

36:16.247 --> 36:18.330
okay-- it's because
my married boss

36:18.382 --> 36:20.382
kept hitting on me, incessantly,

36:20.418 --> 36:23.052
so I hit him back.

36:23.087 --> 36:24.336
Incessantly.

36:25.883 --> 36:27.466
Dr. Brennan,
is everything okay?

36:27.467 --> 36:28.892
Yeah, everything's
fine, except for

36:28.926 --> 36:30.893
a whole lot of crazy going on.

36:30.928 --> 36:33.562
Uh, Mr. Bray,
I'm fine, unless...

36:33.597 --> 36:35.180
unless you have something.

36:35.232 --> 36:36.232
Uh, yes,
actually, I did

36:36.267 --> 36:37.649
find something.

36:37.685 --> 36:39.601
Here, take a look
at the victim's L4.

36:39.653 --> 36:41.737
There appears to a sliver
of fused

36:41.772 --> 36:44.022
vertebra attached,
but what doesn't make sense...

36:44.075 --> 36:46.024
Is that the sliver
is connected at a near

36:46.060 --> 36:47.493
90 degree angle.

36:49.947 --> 36:52.748
Oh, I know what happened.

36:52.783 --> 36:54.450
The lower half of the body

36:54.502 --> 36:55.918
is not missing.

36:55.953 --> 36:58.954
It's still attached
to a living person.

36:59.006 --> 37:01.757
Don't you see?

37:01.792 --> 37:03.342
This half of the body

37:03.377 --> 37:06.128
used to be part
of a larger whole.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.880
Conjoined twin.

37:07.915 --> 37:10.532
It fits.
After being separated

37:10.568 --> 37:12.885
from his other half,
the killer must have

37:12.887 --> 37:15.721
adopted his dead twin's
personality.

37:15.723 --> 37:16.889
Zack didn't do it.

37:16.941 --> 37:18.607
Aside from the one
on his forehead,

37:18.642 --> 37:20.726
he has no scars on his body.
Yeah, I'm not

37:20.728 --> 37:22.311
even gonna ask
how you know that.

37:22.363 --> 37:23.957
BRAY: We need to go through
hospital records.

37:23.981 --> 37:26.148
A surgery like this
would be exceedingly rare.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.534
If we can figure out
who performed the surgery...

37:28.569 --> 37:29.952
No, that would take
too much time.

37:29.987 --> 37:32.738
I know a quicker way
to find identity.

37:33.991 --> 37:35.991
Okay, so, this is my
facial reconstruction

37:36.043 --> 37:37.076
of the teenage victim.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.795
Okay, now I need you
to start aging him.

37:38.796 --> 37:40.612
How far ahead
do you want to go?

37:40.648 --> 37:42.608
From the exfoliation
on the cortical bone, we know

37:42.633 --> 37:44.883
the victim was exhumed
between ten and 20 years ago.

37:44.919 --> 37:46.718
Angela, start
by adding

37:46.754 --> 37:48.070
ten years, then readjust,

37:48.105 --> 37:49.955
adding one year
at a time.

37:51.258 --> 37:53.642
I can't believe that
Zack didn't do it.

37:53.677 --> 37:56.061
The killer manipulated us
into believing that he did.

37:56.096 --> 37:57.646
KAREN:
Which means

37:57.681 --> 37:59.314
whoever did this

37:59.350 --> 38:00.933
must have known Zack intimately.

38:00.935 --> 38:03.485
Known how to steer the evidence.

38:03.521 --> 38:05.287
(beeping)

38:05.322 --> 38:07.189
BRENNAN:
Wait, stop. Angela, uh,

38:07.241 --> 38:10.275
please pull up your scan
of the skull.

38:15.666 --> 38:17.249
That's it.

38:17.284 --> 38:21.787
The markers indicate male,
but the overall dimensions

38:21.789 --> 38:23.255
are less robust in size.

38:23.290 --> 38:24.623
Right, because he was a kid.
He also

38:24.625 --> 38:26.608
could have been
of Eastern Indian decent,

38:26.644 --> 38:28.961
so let me change the skin tone.

38:32.967 --> 38:35.517
Oh, my God.
Uh, add a beard and glasses.

38:39.356 --> 38:40.889
I need to call Booth.

38:43.811 --> 38:45.561
(phone rings)

38:45.613 --> 38:47.529
Bones, what's up?
I was just heading back.

38:47.565 --> 38:48.981
Booth, Zack didn't do it.

38:48.983 --> 38:50.282
It was Dr. Roshan.

38:50.317 --> 38:51.650
I have proof.

38:51.702 --> 38:53.485
You... you have to trust me.

38:53.537 --> 38:55.487
All right, hold on.

38:57.658 --> 39:01.293
Dr. Addy, you've had quite
a trying day, haven't you?

39:01.328 --> 39:02.961
Allow me to

39:02.997 --> 39:06.632
give you something
to help you relax.

39:11.338 --> 39:13.222
Zack...

39:13.257 --> 39:14.840
give me your arm.

39:18.345 --> 39:20.012
I promise...

39:20.014 --> 39:22.564
this will only sting
for a moment.

39:27.404 --> 39:29.354
(grunting)

39:32.243 --> 39:34.026
(coughs)

39:34.028 --> 39:37.195
Doctor, as I have
always told people...

39:37.197 --> 39:39.698
I'm stronger than I look.

39:50.928 --> 39:52.678
I can't do it.

39:53.931 --> 39:55.430
Ow!

39:55.466 --> 39:57.849
(groaning)

40:02.306 --> 40:04.222
Aah...

40:05.359 --> 40:06.808
Good-bye...

40:06.860 --> 40:08.977
Dr. Addy.

40:09.029 --> 40:10.562
(gunshot)

40:17.404 --> 40:19.571
Zack, you okay?

40:21.075 --> 40:22.240
I couldn't do it.

40:22.293 --> 40:23.709
Ow.

40:23.744 --> 40:25.744
I couldn't kill him.

40:28.082 --> 40:30.732
(groans)

40:35.589 --> 40:38.423
Hey. I just wanted
to give you guys the good news.

40:38.425 --> 40:40.425
Zack is okay. So is Booth.

40:40.427 --> 40:42.477
Dr. Roshan, not so much.

40:42.513 --> 40:45.781
MONTENEGRO: That's great.
That's great,

40:45.816 --> 40:48.650
thank you for letting us know.

40:51.305 --> 40:53.438
Dr. Hodgins, are you okay?

40:53.440 --> 40:55.907
Yeah. Yeah, Cam.

40:55.943 --> 40:57.442
I'm just...

40:57.494 --> 41:01.363
really, really relieved
that it's over.

41:06.120 --> 41:08.737
Um, you should tell her.

41:15.713 --> 41:18.180
It's his legs.

41:18.215 --> 41:20.415
Um, he's lost all feeling,

41:20.451 --> 41:23.151
and it's, uh, probably
for good this time.

41:23.187 --> 41:26.988
So... that's what it is.

41:38.869 --> 41:41.153
Hey.

41:43.991 --> 41:47.659
Angela, look at me.

41:47.661 --> 41:50.128
I'm okay.

41:50.164 --> 41:52.647
I'm not in pain.

41:52.683 --> 41:55.300
Okay? I'm okay.

41:55.335 --> 41:58.804
Okay.
I'm okay.

42:20.444 --> 42:22.411
Thank you
for coming to visit.

42:22.446 --> 42:25.447
It is nice to see you both
in a non-adversarial climate.

42:25.499 --> 42:27.999
Zack, given what's happened,
I've been looking into

42:28.035 --> 42:30.869
having you transferred,
if that's what you'd like.

42:30.921 --> 42:33.538
Yes. I've been doing a great
deal of thinking on the subject,

42:33.540 --> 42:35.540
and I believe I am now ready
to reenter society.

42:35.542 --> 42:37.259
No, no, hold on,
Zack, okay,

42:37.294 --> 42:39.878
this is a transfer.
You understand that, correct?

42:41.932 --> 42:43.715
I never killed the lobbyist.

42:43.767 --> 42:46.885
I confessed because I assumed
I would if I'd been instructed,

42:46.887 --> 42:49.721
but then last night, I learned
I'm not capable of killing.

42:49.723 --> 42:51.606
Not even to save myself.

42:53.744 --> 42:55.227
BRENNAN:
No, I don't believe it.

42:55.229 --> 42:57.229
You confessed.

42:57.281 --> 42:58.613
The evidence...

42:58.649 --> 43:01.450
Should be reexamined.
I did not kill him.

43:01.485 --> 43:02.451
I believe you.

43:02.486 --> 43:04.069
Booth...
Trust me. Listen,

43:04.071 --> 43:05.654
you know what,
we're gonna help you.

43:05.706 --> 43:07.456
You understand?
You've served your time.

43:07.491 --> 43:09.574
Thank you.
Zack.

43:09.626 --> 43:11.743
He doesn't like hugs.

43:15.749 --> 43:17.299
I have gloves on.
Stop.
