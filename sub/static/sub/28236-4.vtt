<i>Previously
on</i> Billions...

00:14.900 --> 00:16.419
This is
an object lesson.

00:16.421 --> 00:18.261
People
learn much better

00:18.263 --> 00:21.344
when heightened emotions
accompany the instruction.

00:21.346 --> 00:23.146
Epstein's vacated
New York Attorney General's seat

00:23.148 --> 00:24.587
is there for me.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.149
But the moment
I poke my head up,

00:26.151 --> 00:28.110
Jack Foley
will come after me.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.952
<i>I'd like you to meet
Douglas Mason. He's my father.</i>

00:29.954 --> 00:31.113
I thought you were ready.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.516
To use your
"preferred pronouns..."

00:33.518 --> 00:35.678
They're the ones used
by those who respect me.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.681
Taylor knows I'm front-running
their positions.

00:37.683 --> 00:40.884
Stop fucking
with Taylor Mason.

00:40.886 --> 00:45.128
"I am <i>chomping</i> at the bit to be
your next Attorney General"!

00:45.130 --> 00:47.970
I need your assistance.
Starting with the primary.

00:47.972 --> 00:49.412
You want me
to help put you

00:49.414 --> 00:51.133
in the State Attorney
General's office.

00:51.135 --> 00:52.455
I do.

01:34.069 --> 01:36.109
We're gonna be here
all fucking night.

01:36.111 --> 01:37.310
If we don't get caught.

01:37.312 --> 01:38.751
We're not gonna get caught.

01:38.753 --> 01:40.513
Well, you sound pretty sure
for someone wearing

01:40.515 --> 01:43.956
bright fucking yellow
like you're in <i>Kill Bill.</i>

01:44.959 --> 01:47.520
I'm in camo, bro.

01:47.522 --> 01:49.082
In this lot,
I'm fucking invisible.

01:50.566 --> 01:53.366
Besides, we're getting
paid well enough...

02:18.914 --> 02:20.673
Once, when I was a boy,

02:20.675 --> 02:24.237
I lost a hundred bucks
I didn't have at a carny game.

02:24.239 --> 02:26.999
Hard to feature that. But, uh,
before you really launch in...

02:27.001 --> 02:28.681
I was very young.

02:28.683 --> 02:30.563
I thought the game was
to knock down the pins.

02:30.565 --> 02:32.645
The game though,
was to get people to pay

02:32.647 --> 02:34.727
to <i>try</i> to knock down
the pins.

02:34.729 --> 02:36.772
Which, of course,
didn't go down.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.814
And, uh, the guys playing
the game were carny workers.

02:41.816 --> 02:43.016
And you were merely the...

02:43.018 --> 02:44.177
Sucker.

02:44.179 --> 02:45.978
Right. Yeah.

02:45.980 --> 02:49.622
Today, your opponent thinks
an election is taking place.

02:49.624 --> 02:52.344
But he doesn't know
how many of his voters

02:52.346 --> 02:54.547
are already en route
to a free junket

02:54.549 --> 02:56.909
with fresh Buffalo nickels
in their pockets.

02:56.911 --> 02:59.271
Or that parents in his best
districts have been forced

02:59.273 --> 03:01.434
to drive their kids
to school

03:01.436 --> 03:03.396
instead of getting down
to the voting booths

03:03.398 --> 03:05.798
because the school buses
were all out of commission.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.721
By day's end, it'll be
the lowest voter turnout

03:08.723 --> 03:12.645
in primary history, which will
allow you to eke out a victory.

03:12.647 --> 03:15.367
And then you will be
the presumptive

03:15.369 --> 03:18.252
Attorney General of New York
goddamned State.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.855
This is where you do some
version of the happy dance.

03:22.857 --> 03:24.217
Ah.

03:24.219 --> 03:26.299
And I know just the jig
I'd throw down on

03:26.301 --> 03:28.181
if I thought
that were so...

03:28.183 --> 03:31.145
flatfoot and buck,
like they do in the Ozarks.

03:36.190 --> 03:39.351
But, uh, sadly, no matter
how few vote today,

03:39.353 --> 03:41.794
I'm not gonna book a win.

03:41.796 --> 03:44.716
The thing to remember,
Black Jack, is that the only

03:44.718 --> 03:48.361
folks who win in a Mexican
standoff are the rest of us.

03:48.363 --> 03:50.763
Because
all the Mexicans die.

03:50.765 --> 03:53.886
No. T-This situation
is different.

03:53.888 --> 03:55.768
I don't see how.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.730
You have your guns
trained on my boy,

03:57.732 --> 03:59.772
my boy has his
trained on you.

03:59.774 --> 04:02.254
Anyone fires,
everyone fires.

04:02.256 --> 04:03.856
Death to one and all.

04:03.858 --> 04:07.899
But if <i>no one</i> fires,

04:07.901 --> 04:09.181
everyone survives.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.984
And thrives.

04:11.986 --> 04:16.028
Well, I may not see the
narrative just the way you do.

04:16.029 --> 04:17.990
Because I may not be
as worried

04:17.992 --> 04:20.834
about dying in the gun fight
as you are.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.999
As long as the boy
goes down, too.

04:27.161 --> 04:30.882
Now is not the time to throw
away a lifetime of pragmatism.

04:30.884 --> 04:32.644
Perhaps I'm doing
just the opposite

04:32.646 --> 04:34.648
of throwing it away,
Charles.

04:35.048 --> 04:37.970
Perhaps I'm doing the most
pragmatic thing I know to do.

04:37.972 --> 04:41.854
And that is: to make certain
this office stays pristine.

04:41.856 --> 04:45.057
At whatever cost.

04:45.059 --> 04:47.059
So have no doubt:

04:47.061 --> 04:48.620
Your boy shall never be

04:48.622 --> 04:51.062
the Attorney General
of this proud state...

04:51.064 --> 04:54.386
or of any of the lesser states
of our great nation.

04:54.388 --> 04:55.987
Not on my watch.

04:55.989 --> 04:59.792
And if that means he goes
public with some story

04:59.794 --> 05:04.757
about metals and bridges and me,
so be it.

05:04.759 --> 05:06.999
But he can't prosecute it
anymore.

05:07.001 --> 05:11.963
And I hardly think that story
will capture the imagination

05:11.965 --> 05:15.206
the same way his degenerate
sex life will.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.449
By 5:00 p.m.
tomorrow afternoon

05:17.451 --> 05:20.251
he declares he's
withdrawing from the primary,

05:20.253 --> 05:23.294
or I go public.

05:23.296 --> 05:25.257
What he has on you
is that strong?

05:25.259 --> 05:28.582
If he exposes it,
my chances are flushed.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.303
Could just be posturing,

05:31.305 --> 05:33.865
knowing that you don't actually
want to trade blows.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.747
Charles Rhoades Senior
would have sniffed that out.

05:35.749 --> 05:38.550
No. No.

05:38.552 --> 05:41.915
I may have to lay down to him,
get out of the race.

05:43.396 --> 05:47.398
"Always outnumbered.
Always outgunned."

05:47.400 --> 05:49.121
As Mosley said it best.

05:49.123 --> 05:51.603
That's the state of play
for guys like us.

05:51.605 --> 05:54.446
That's what we need to get us up
with the sun.

05:54.448 --> 05:55.767
You can't quit.

05:55.769 --> 05:58.009
All I have to do
is say the words.

05:58.011 --> 06:00.013
But you won't.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.619
You know...

06:08.621 --> 06:11.743
and this
isn't easy to say:

06:11.745 --> 06:14.466
you were the most formidable
opponent I ever had.

06:14.468 --> 06:15.907
'Cause you read me.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.510
My chest
was out, sure,

06:18.512 --> 06:20.352
but inside it,
my heart was racing

06:20.354 --> 06:22.355
when I knew that you were
coming for me.

06:23.797 --> 06:25.757
I'll admit
that cheers me.

06:25.759 --> 06:28.962
Well, then take it in, man.
Let it fuel you. Then fight on.

06:30.803 --> 06:33.444
You know I will do
everything humanly possible

06:33.446 --> 06:35.448
right up until
his deadline.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.852
I'm a phone call away
if you need me.

06:44.858 --> 06:46.658
Karl!

06:50.183 --> 06:54.025
Find out why Foley is so willing
to engage in this brinkmanship.

06:54.027 --> 06:55.466
There's something here
I'm not seeing.

06:55.468 --> 06:57.188
Yup.

07:10.483 --> 07:12.403
I know you rarely take the time
to look after yourself.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.328
A latte, the way you like it,
and a ginger scone.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.890
Animal-free, gluten-free.
Of course.

07:19.892 --> 07:21.332
Are you heading
back home soon?

07:21.334 --> 07:24.498
I planned to, but...

07:27.621 --> 07:31.462
Materials on what...
a proposed business?

07:31.464 --> 07:34.225
Yes.
Lattice grid fins, you know?

07:34.227 --> 07:36.427
Your white whale.

07:36.429 --> 07:38.869
A mathematically based
enhancement.

07:38.871 --> 07:42.152
Ups efficiency
to unheard of levels.

07:42.154 --> 07:43.874
Perhaps
you can take a look.

07:43.876 --> 07:45.436
Or I could take you
through it...

07:45.438 --> 07:47.719
I don't want to be in a position
to say "no" to you.

07:47.721 --> 07:49.440
Hey, who says
you're going to, huh?

07:49.442 --> 07:51.202
Wait'll you see the tech...

07:51.204 --> 07:54.285
And I thought the extended visit
was about our relationship.

07:54.287 --> 07:57.848
It was.
It is about us.

07:57.850 --> 08:02.132
I could use a hand... a financial
hand... with my endeavor, is all.

08:03.456 --> 08:05.055
But it's
pretty special.

08:05.057 --> 08:07.059
It really is this time.

08:08.020 --> 08:11.061
Please, look at it.
When you can.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.079
- You alright?
- Yes.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.970
This thing is fun
to drive.

08:37.570 --> 08:39.250
Want to take it
for a lap or two?

08:39.251 --> 08:40.530
I have to head
to the airport.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.092
So, you're leaving
out of Houston.

08:42.094 --> 08:45.055
Yep. Are you sure you
don't want to join me?

08:45.057 --> 08:46.777
You sound like
you want to join me.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.140
We can run a friction test
up there.

08:50.142 --> 08:51.902
Ah. In the name
of science.

08:51.904 --> 08:54.144
Absolutely.

08:54.146 --> 08:57.027
I've been wanting to do the
zero-gravity flight for years.

08:57.029 --> 08:59.950
I have the whole aircraft
to myself. I paid 165K.

08:59.952 --> 09:01.752
I would've paid
whatever they asked.

09:01.754 --> 09:04.475
Thanks. But I'm gonna have to
leave the vomit comet to you...

09:04.477 --> 09:05.756
Wimp.

09:05.758 --> 09:07.117
That might work
another time.

09:07.119 --> 09:09.279
But I really can't.

09:09.281 --> 09:11.642
I got to deliver a sickening
ride of my own today...

09:11.644 --> 09:14.284
to the CEO
of Noon to Night stores...

09:14.286 --> 09:16.486
I mean, how do you not
turn a fucking profit

09:16.488 --> 09:20.490
with two thousand locations
selling soda and cigs?

09:20.492 --> 09:21.731
You're sitting
with Evan Robards?

09:21.733 --> 09:22.972
Nah. Chris Sacca first.

09:22.974 --> 09:24.655
He's throwing his shares
behind me.

09:24.657 --> 09:27.057
Then I "big stake" Robards
before he takes the stage

09:27.059 --> 09:28.699
at the shareholder meeting.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.381
He hits the bricks.
I leave with two board seats.

09:31.383 --> 09:33.143
Have fun storming
the castle.

09:33.145 --> 09:34.665
Oh, I will.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.426
Send me a pic
from the stratosphere.

09:52.324 --> 09:53.363
So?

09:53.365 --> 09:56.286
Nice ride. How much?

09:56.288 --> 09:58.330
$132,000.

09:59.331 --> 10:00.570
I'll take two.

10:00.572 --> 10:02.574
What color do you want?

10:32.203 --> 10:34.443
<i>It's leaking, Axe.
It's leaking and it's gonna</i>

10:34.445 --> 10:36.406
<i>blow and there's nothing
anyone can do about it...</i>

10:36.408 --> 10:37.848
Who the fuck is this?

10:37.850 --> 10:39.409
Carter Calloway,
from Baton Rouge...

10:39.411 --> 10:43.213
Okay. Slow down, breathe,
and tell me what's going on.

10:43.215 --> 10:46.576
An LNG terminal at the port
has a perforation.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.298
It wasn't detected
until it was too late

10:48.300 --> 10:49.819
and when those vapors
build up...

10:49.821 --> 10:51.300
- Boom.
- Ka-boom.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.062
The tank's gonna explode.

10:53.064 --> 10:55.064
Then the shrapnel from that
will set off other tanks...

10:55.066 --> 10:56.586
Are you sure about this?

10:56.588 --> 10:58.347
<i>It's science.
It's inevitable.</i>

10:58.349 --> 11:01.031
Gonna go up like a bullfrog
with an M-80 in its ass.

11:01.033 --> 11:03.393
Who else knows about this?

11:03.395 --> 11:05.835
No one. Yet.
But everyone's gonna.

11:05.837 --> 11:07.877
I want your business, that's why
I called you. You said if...

11:07.879 --> 11:09.839
Yeah. I know what I said.
We'll do business later.

11:09.841 --> 11:11.681
First I need to know
which company.

11:11.683 --> 11:14.444
I gave you all I got.
Whatever companies are involved

11:14.446 --> 11:16.686
are gonna try to keep it quiet
as long as possible.

11:16.688 --> 11:18.728
- But at some point...
- Fireball.

11:18.730 --> 11:22.571
Yep. You've got
3, 4 hours at the most

11:22.573 --> 11:24.014
before the whole world
knows.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.576
Okay. Keep me posted
with whatever you hear.

11:30.862 --> 11:32.582
We need to get out
of natural gas.

11:32.584 --> 11:34.103
Which position?

11:34.105 --> 11:35.545
All of 'em.

11:35.547 --> 11:37.787
Natural gas's
going to take a dump.

11:37.789 --> 11:41.390
<i>Pipelines, shipping... all
its corollaries... everything</i>

11:41.392 --> 11:44.313
tied to it's gonna go along
for the downward spiral.

11:44.315 --> 11:48.638
So get set, get everyone ready,
and get it done at the open.

11:51.483 --> 11:53.843
Make all trades
through the dark pools

11:53.845 --> 11:55.645
so it masks what we're doing.

11:55.647 --> 11:57.366
That way, we'll preserve
our head start.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.408
Which will not be a long one.

12:00.852 --> 12:02.691
There's the opening bell.

12:10.261 --> 12:11.981
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey. What's going on?

12:11.983 --> 12:13.543
- Motherfucker!
- Computer's down...

12:13.545 --> 12:15.104
Fuck. Where's IT!?

12:15.106 --> 12:16.426
The Bloombergs are fine,

12:16.428 --> 12:18.467
it's Axe Cap's network
that's been disabled.

12:18.469 --> 12:20.549
- So our whole system is offline?
- I'm already on it.

12:20.551 --> 12:21.991
I ran a reboot...

12:25.196 --> 12:27.198
What the...?
Won't reboot...

12:28.199 --> 12:32.281
We've, uh, we're being hacked.
Brute force attack.

12:32.283 --> 12:34.483
Someone's gained remote access
to our servers...

12:34.485 --> 12:36.245
The entire reason
for your existence

12:36.247 --> 12:38.928
is to make sure that is not
the fucking case.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.369
I thought since
the EternalBlue exploit,

12:40.371 --> 12:42.091
we took protective
measures and backup.

12:42.093 --> 12:44.013
This situation is
supposed to be impossible.

12:44.015 --> 12:45.414
Sure. And a hummingbird

12:45.416 --> 12:47.736
shouldn't be able to fly
sideways. But it does.

12:47.738 --> 12:50.339
The more reliable rule
of the world is:

12:50.341 --> 12:54.903
The aggressor always moves
forward the science first.

12:54.905 --> 12:59.107
But we do have backup.
So go get it working. Now.

13:01.753 --> 13:03.993
Foley is terminal.

13:03.995 --> 13:06.595
Started in the liver.

13:06.597 --> 13:08.517
The guy is so tough
he didn't see a doc

13:08.519 --> 13:09.958
until it was everywhere.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.561
Even when it's your enemies,
you hate to hear that.

13:12.563 --> 13:13.762
How long?

13:13.764 --> 13:15.766
Few weeks.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.366
Which is why he's going
full suicide vest.

13:18.368 --> 13:21.369
Goddamn, he's committed.

13:21.371 --> 13:22.651
I hope I face my own end

13:22.653 --> 13:24.213
with the same "fuck you"
to the world.

13:24.215 --> 13:26.217
It's my fondest wish
for you.

13:27.899 --> 13:30.739
Some folks inside Justice are
saying he's been back channeling

13:30.741 --> 13:32.861
negotiating immunity
for his heirs.

13:32.863 --> 13:35.183
Gimme what you got
on Mr. Rhoades.

13:48.399 --> 13:50.521
I always knew
he was a pervert.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.082
A profane man to his end.

13:57.328 --> 13:59.488
Once that's out of the way,
he knows that even if I drop

13:59.490 --> 14:01.690
what I have on him,
it won't splash onto his family.

14:01.692 --> 14:04.733
They'll keep the wealth.
Oh, heavens.

14:04.735 --> 14:06.334
The great man's
final move.

14:08.538 --> 14:11.940
There may really be no stopping
Foley at this point.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.632
Blood in the water
at Axe Cap.

14:23.634 --> 14:26.835
Cook says they're under
some kind of cyberattack.

14:26.837 --> 14:28.396
Ok.

14:28.398 --> 14:29.637
Maybe there's a move here
for us.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.079
I'm the one
who sued for peace.

14:31.081 --> 14:33.881
Yes. Do you believe
that offer was accepted?

14:33.883 --> 14:35.564
- I don't.
- Might there be something

14:35.566 --> 14:38.247
we could do to take advantage
of the situation there?

14:38.249 --> 14:41.089
Something that wouldn't be
construed as warring,

14:41.091 --> 14:42.771
merely opportunistic?

14:42.773 --> 14:45.133
Yes. Have Mafee
call around.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.375
See what Axe Cap was slinging
when the attack hit.

14:50.901 --> 14:53.061
- Phone's down...
- Mine too.

14:53.063 --> 14:55.143
- Fuck.
- Um, not to pile on,

14:55.145 --> 14:57.024
but in the spirit of aggregating
all the information

14:57.026 --> 14:58.786
- we currently have...
- Ben!

14:58.788 --> 15:01.109
The direct links to the trading
desks are down too.

15:01.111 --> 15:03.111
Motherfuck!

15:06.156 --> 15:10.238
Okay, "here" is dead.
So we trade like we're not here.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.120
Use EMSX on your mobile devices.

15:12.122 --> 15:15.083
Do not sign onto the network,
use cellular.

15:15.085 --> 15:16.244
I have my laptop.

15:16.246 --> 15:17.525
Great. Same deal.

15:17.527 --> 15:18.686
Stay off our network.

15:18.688 --> 15:19.887
I've got a hotspot.

15:21.811 --> 15:23.412
I'm up.

15:23.414 --> 15:26.855
Attaway. Now we ride you
like Justify.

15:26.857 --> 15:30.618
Okay. Sell fifty thousand shares
Con-Pipe, at the market.

15:30.620 --> 15:33.781
Sell 100 thousand Southern Gulf
Petro at the market.

15:33.783 --> 15:35.984
Go through the dark pool
algo... we can't have

15:35.986 --> 15:37.745
anyone see what
we're offloading.

15:37.747 --> 15:39.627
You're literally
breathing down my neck.

15:39.629 --> 15:41.709
I can literally feel
h-hot breath...

15:41.711 --> 15:43.150
Say "literally" again

15:43.152 --> 15:45.433
and I will light you on fire
like a dragon of yore.

15:45.435 --> 15:47.956
First trade is confirmed...

15:47.958 --> 15:49.277
Second one is through.

15:49.279 --> 15:51.479
Nice. Okay.
Now let's...

15:51.481 --> 15:55.723
It froze.
I'll force quit and reboot...

15:55.725 --> 15:57.727
Go to mobile apps...

15:58.328 --> 15:59.727
My shit's locked up.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.889
I'm jammed up like
I ate a pint of rice.

16:01.891 --> 16:03.771
Yeah, this is a concerted
attack, so anything

16:03.773 --> 16:06.013
that's mobile that's been on the
network the past couple of days

16:06.015 --> 16:08.017
has probably
been malwared.

16:10.139 --> 16:11.299
Fix it!

16:23.953 --> 16:25.593
This is Grigor.

16:25.595 --> 16:29.076
He's the only one with the
financial and tactical resources

16:29.078 --> 16:31.078
to take us
totally off the grid.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.480
Guess he wasn't so sanguine
as Taylor was

16:33.482 --> 16:34.761
with us
front-running 'em.

16:34.763 --> 16:36.604
Guess not.

16:36.606 --> 16:38.006
How should we
go after him?

16:38.008 --> 16:39.887
We can't. Not yet.

16:39.889 --> 16:41.849
First, we're gonna hold
the fucking line here

16:41.851 --> 16:43.251
and pare our losses.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.093
Protect our book.
Use resources of our own.

16:46.095 --> 16:47.975
What are those, exactly?

16:47.977 --> 16:51.779
At the moment,
that's you and me, pal.

16:59.109 --> 17:01.069
Like Huey Lewis
crooned...

17:01.071 --> 17:04.952
we're going back in time.

17:04.954 --> 17:06.955
Who's ready to do
some smilin' and dialin'?!

17:08.518 --> 17:10.838
Heads up.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.359
Pump up your
Reebok Blacktops,

17:13.362 --> 17:15.364
we've gotta do this
old school...

17:16.365 --> 17:17.723
Fuck, I don't even have

17:17.726 --> 17:19.246
any trading desk
phone numbers anymore.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.727
Which of you tenderfoots

17:20.729 --> 17:22.289
has the numbers for
the prime trading desks?

17:22.290 --> 17:24.531
We all pretty much use
Bloomberg chat these days.

17:24.534 --> 17:26.374
Okay.

17:26.376 --> 17:28.976
Get the CEO of every prime
on the phone...

17:28.978 --> 17:30.778
they're the only ones
we got numbers on.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.621
I want them to walk down to
their fucking trading floors

17:33.623 --> 17:35.102
and set up open lines
with us.

17:35.104 --> 17:36.663
Okay, everybody, here.

17:36.665 --> 17:38.986
Use there burners,
call friends on the outside.

17:38.988 --> 17:42.149
Have 'em get on social media
and get direct dials

17:42.151 --> 17:46.152
from anyone who can make
a market on one of our names.

17:46.154 --> 17:48.075
Do you think you're still gonna
get to your Chris Sacca

17:48.077 --> 17:51.761
meeting on the
Noon to Night shares?

17:58.687 --> 18:00.968
Hi. Where are you?

18:00.970 --> 18:02.649
On my way
to the airport.

18:02.651 --> 18:05.212
Okay, look.

18:05.214 --> 18:09.496
I hate to do this,
but I need a big fucking favor.

18:09.498 --> 18:11.579
<i>One that would have you
missing the vomit comet.</i>

18:11.581 --> 18:14.101
<i>But if you
do it for me,</i>

18:14.103 --> 18:15.622
I promise you that
I will re-book it.

18:15.624 --> 18:17.304
And I'll even go
with you.

18:24.433 --> 18:26.753
What the fuck is that?

18:26.755 --> 18:30.316
That, my young lass,
is a Filofax.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.838
The vaunted
little black book.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.561
It contains the names of
some world class ladies...

18:34.563 --> 18:36.844
Who are grandmothers now,
if not fucking dead...

18:36.846 --> 18:40.647
And also the number,
written in un-hackable ink,

18:40.649 --> 18:42.329
of an old broker friend
on the Toronto Exchange,

18:42.331 --> 18:44.491
who can move some shares
nice and quiet for us...

18:48.617 --> 18:50.777
Chris.

18:50.779 --> 18:53.059
Hey, Rebecca.
I was just getting out of here.

18:53.061 --> 18:55.221
I'm late. Well, Axe is.
I'm here in his stead.

18:55.223 --> 18:58.664
Seriously?
I didn't send Mark Cuban.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.307
Uh, no, you didn't.
But I'm here.

19:00.309 --> 19:02.309
And I'm gonna work with you
on getting the CEO out.

19:02.311 --> 19:05.232
Come here.

19:05.234 --> 19:07.834
Those shares?
I dumped 'em.

19:07.836 --> 19:10.196
So I can't back Axe.

19:10.198 --> 19:11.998
That's not what you told him
you would do.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.199
Look, either way,
it's moot.

19:13.201 --> 19:15.882
I no longer have a horse
in this race.

19:15.884 --> 19:18.084
<i>Honey, baby, sweetie...</i>

19:18.086 --> 19:20.486
...It's your dear old
Uncle Wags.

19:20.488 --> 19:22.288
Haven't seen you
since that tray of kamikazes

19:22.290 --> 19:24.171
we stared down after Sohn...

19:24.173 --> 19:27.494
Jared! Yeah.

19:27.496 --> 19:30.777
It's actually Bobby Axelrod.

19:30.779 --> 19:33.099
Sure. You can call me "Axe"
if it makes you feel good.

19:33.101 --> 19:35.782
I figured why be so impersonal
as to let a few keystrokes

19:35.784 --> 19:37.944
run our life, why not
reach out and touch?

19:37.946 --> 19:41.267
...Don't be scared,
no need to be frightened.

19:41.269 --> 19:42.829
No.
I'm giving you a call

19:42.831 --> 19:44.310
because I heard good things
about you, Jared.

19:44.312 --> 19:45.711
And I come bearing gifts.

19:45.713 --> 19:47.954
Three hundred thousand
Drill Southern to go...

19:47.956 --> 19:49.716
I know it's tough,

19:49.718 --> 19:52.801
that is why I'm calling
the young master.

19:53.602 --> 19:55.962
He's putting me up on a hundred,
to work two hundred behind it.

19:55.964 --> 19:57.043
At the market...

19:57.045 --> 19:59.205
I'm sitting on
half a mil Bay Pipeline

19:59.207 --> 20:02.570
and I want to exit quick
and silent as <i>Le Samourai...</i>

20:03.852 --> 20:07.213
It's an old French movie.
Nevermind...

20:07.215 --> 20:09.335
And the next time I get a good
call, you're getting it too.

20:09.337 --> 20:13.980
Go out and buy yourself
a longer boat come bonus time.

20:13.982 --> 20:16.743
Forty-nine low. Stop me
out at forty-eight and a half.

20:16.745 --> 20:20.106
...Yeah, you and me
at the Open.

20:20.108 --> 20:21.948
My box on Arthur Ashe.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.749
Mr. Simmons, sir.

20:23.751 --> 20:26.712
Yeah, I'm calling you "Mister"
'cause this one might hurt.

20:26.714 --> 20:29.035
How much can you take?
One fifty?

20:29.037 --> 20:31.637
Put on your fucking hard hat
and I'll get your commish

20:31.639 --> 20:35.161
at five cents a share
instead of three...

20:35.163 --> 20:36.883
Two hundred and fifty's
a lot better.

20:36.885 --> 20:39.445
Sure, sure.
You and me at the Open.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.408
My box on Arthur Ashe.
You got it.

20:42.410 --> 20:47.253
I too, come from
the old school.

20:47.255 --> 20:50.336
The old <i>math</i> school
that is.

20:50.338 --> 20:51.937
Allow me

20:51.939 --> 20:55.941
to be
our office <i>Cartesian.</i>

20:55.943 --> 20:58.584
Got it from a guy
at a gas desk.

20:58.586 --> 21:01.347
Large block of natural gas
dumped through a dark pool,

21:01.349 --> 21:02.989
but he knew
who was behind it.

21:02.991 --> 21:05.471
Lots of big prints like that
going up around town.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.874
Feels like Axe Cap
trading out of the sector.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.277
You know what?
Let's sell our positions...

21:11.279 --> 21:13.799
satisfy the buyers out there.
Depress the price.

21:13.801 --> 21:16.081
Maybe kill it.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.404
Love it, boss-people.

21:23.331 --> 21:26.612
Why you stiff-arming me, Pete?

21:26.614 --> 21:29.655
I know my guys have taken errors
from you when you've needed it.

21:29.657 --> 21:31.937
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

21:31.939 --> 21:34.099
I need you to clean me up
on Gulfport LNG,

21:34.101 --> 21:35.941
what do you mean
you're not a buyer?

21:35.943 --> 21:40.225
If you tell me you can't bid me,
this is the last time we speak.

21:40.227 --> 21:42.908
How'd you just fucking
satisfy your need?...

21:42.910 --> 21:44.870
I'm running into would-be buyers
who already bought.

21:44.872 --> 21:47.275
Yeah. Me too. Fuck.
Keep jamming.

21:48.396 --> 21:51.197
I'll believe that you're
satisfied when I hear you moan

21:51.199 --> 21:53.359
and shake like an old
washing machine...

21:53.361 --> 21:55.801
And you will tell me
who finished you off.

21:55.803 --> 21:57.643
We are sitting down
over a porterhouse

21:57.645 --> 22:00.365
and discussing every
fucking detail of this.

22:01.368 --> 22:04.449
You, me, at the Open.

22:04.451 --> 22:08.533
Uh-huh. Oh, my box
on Arthur Ashe.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.095
Good.

22:11.659 --> 22:13.739
Someone's flooding the market
with our names.

22:13.741 --> 22:16.302
- Taylor?
- Probably.

22:16.304 --> 22:18.183
The Street is seeing that
our prints are going up,

22:18.185 --> 22:19.705
and they're talking.

22:19.707 --> 22:21.907
Taylor knows we're having
a panic yard sale.

22:21.909 --> 22:22.948
And they're piling on.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.952
Yeah, well, wouldn't we?

22:25.913 --> 22:28.353
Why's everyone
sitting here dumbstruck

22:28.355 --> 22:30.155
like they're at fricking
Cirque du Soleil?

22:30.157 --> 22:33.758
I'd like to help. But I've never
made a voice trade in my life.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.682
Uh. None of us have.
We don't know how.

22:36.684 --> 22:38.684
What about a big trade?
A sensitive one?

22:38.686 --> 22:40.005
Those have to happen
by phone.

22:40.007 --> 22:42.009
Mafee did them.

22:43.330 --> 22:46.171
Oh. When this is over, we are
having a fucking seminar.

22:46.173 --> 22:48.175
Believe that.

22:48.495 --> 22:50.695
Ever think you'd miss Mafee
this much?

22:50.697 --> 22:53.578
I miss him like the case
of crabs I had freshman year.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.819
Delightful.

22:56.703 --> 22:59.705
Hey. Listen... we've
got to undercut Taylor.

22:59.707 --> 23:01.427
Sweeten the deals
and up the pressure.

23:01.429 --> 23:02.748
Find some
fucking squirrels

23:02.750 --> 23:04.349
who've been dying
to get in our pants.

23:04.351 --> 23:06.191
We're already shoving it down
people's throats out there,

23:06.193 --> 23:07.512
what do we do now?

23:07.514 --> 23:09.516
Shove harder.

23:14.401 --> 23:16.121
- How's it going?
- <i>Breezy. You?</i>

23:16.123 --> 23:18.443
- Sacca's out.
- Out?

23:18.445 --> 23:20.885
Apologies and all that.
So fucking forget him for now.

23:20.887 --> 23:22.968
My sleeves are rolled up.
My chin's tucked.

23:22.970 --> 23:24.570
Fists raised.
I'm ready to scrap.

23:24.572 --> 23:26.772
I knew I liked you
for a reason.

23:26.774 --> 23:28.573
You're gonna kill a CEO.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.215
Oh,
you're damn right I am.

23:32.259 --> 23:34.259
There it is,

23:34.261 --> 23:37.462
Elysian Fields.

23:37.464 --> 23:39.224
It's grandiose.

23:39.226 --> 23:42.867
The name <i>should</i>
invite dreams.

23:42.869 --> 23:45.309
This development
is my legacy.

23:45.311 --> 23:47.112
Hell, it's your
legacy too.

23:47.114 --> 23:48.994
Generational wealth,
Sonny,

23:48.996 --> 23:51.877
beyond you,
beyond your kids even.

23:51.879 --> 23:54.922
As long as certain expedited
approvals come through.

23:57.284 --> 24:00.805
And I'm counting on you
for that.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.528
One: today is primary day.

24:03.530 --> 24:05.930
The last place I should be is
where I can't speak to voters.

24:05.932 --> 24:08.012
Two: I can't speak
to voters anyway

24:08.014 --> 24:09.774
because I have to
quit the race.

24:09.776 --> 24:12.778
Three: Even if I didn't have to
quit, this would be a disaster.

24:12.780 --> 24:16.101
It's the worst possible moment
for me to lubricate a situation

24:16.103 --> 24:18.303
for you and create
a possible scandal.

24:18.305 --> 24:20.385
It hasn't always
been convenient

24:20.387 --> 24:22.587
for me to haul you out
by the ass

24:22.589 --> 24:25.590
from whatever bear trap
you got into either, Sonny.

24:25.592 --> 24:28.312
Well, as I said,

24:28.314 --> 24:30.434
I couldn't be much help
even if I were willing.

24:30.436 --> 24:31.956
Foley can't be moved.

24:31.958 --> 24:34.880
- Everyone can be...
- He's got a cancer, Dad.

24:34.882 --> 24:37.482
Moving through him
like a race car

24:37.484 --> 24:39.084
on the Bonneville
Salt Flats...

24:39.086 --> 24:40.725
fast and full steam ahead.

24:40.727 --> 24:43.129
Ah, Jesus.

24:45.291 --> 24:48.613
That buckles a man
at the knees. Even me.

24:48.615 --> 24:51.095
And it buckles you, too.
On all counts.

24:51.097 --> 24:52.576
Yeah.

24:52.578 --> 24:55.579
So you can stay here

24:55.581 --> 24:57.381
and keep looking
for your future out there.

24:57.383 --> 24:59.064
I've got to go
and face mine,

24:59.066 --> 25:01.346
which starts at five o'clock
today, whether I like it or not.

25:01.348 --> 25:06.150
What if you
defy him anyway?

25:06.152 --> 25:10.474
Let him say what he says.
Deny it.

25:10.476 --> 25:13.279
Tough it the fuck out.

25:15.521 --> 25:20.324
Even if I could weather the
public shaming, I'd lose anyway.

25:20.326 --> 25:22.727
How do I ask Wendy
to face that crap?

25:22.729 --> 25:27.332
Well, if she's angry
about it,

25:27.334 --> 25:29.253
let her give you
a good smack later.

25:29.255 --> 25:31.375
A win for everyone
involved.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.301
Well, I'm glad to see you've got
your legs under you again, Dad.

25:41.107 --> 25:44.588
Dead soldier. Reload.

25:44.590 --> 25:47.912
Gimme a "45."
Thank you, peach.

25:47.914 --> 25:51.716
Listen, do this for me
and you'll have a fucking angel

25:51.718 --> 25:53.998
on your shoulder
your whole career.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.321
I'm a good friend
but a bad fucking enemy.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.643
...Solid choice, Kevin.

25:59.645 --> 26:03.567
I need a freshie.
Book one-thirty TransCon Petro.

26:03.569 --> 26:05.249
I took a little bit of a hit
at twenty-eight.

26:05.251 --> 26:06.730
Wags,
we don't have much time,

26:06.732 --> 26:08.532
- news is breaking.
- People are hearing shit...

26:08.534 --> 26:10.253
port's in lockdown,
evacuation underway.

26:10.255 --> 26:13.297
Eighty thousand shares offloaded
through my Canuck on the TSX.

26:13.299 --> 26:15.780
Ice, ice, baby.

26:18.184 --> 26:20.186
It's wrong.

26:21.787 --> 26:24.950
Where's it wrong?

26:30.356 --> 26:31.755
All of it.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.239
All of it's wrong.
The whole thing.

26:52.297 --> 26:56.980
Foley is going to come forth.
With what he knows about me.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.985
About us.

26:59.585 --> 27:03.627
The only way to stop him
is for me to bow out.

27:03.629 --> 27:06.072
That's his demand.

27:15.841 --> 27:18.243
Then I'm sorry
that it's over.

27:21.887 --> 27:23.807
Does it have to be?

27:23.809 --> 27:25.369
I think so.

27:25.371 --> 27:28.172
Well, what if I fight?

27:28.174 --> 27:30.614
What if I take
the humiliation.

27:30.616 --> 27:33.377
Lean into it.
Proceed despite it.

27:33.379 --> 27:37.460
Then you will lose <i>and</i>
we will be a laughing stock.

27:37.462 --> 27:40.663
- Are you sure?
- Are you fucking insane?

27:40.665 --> 27:42.667
Tell me why I am.

27:46.552 --> 27:49.193
I'm sure of a few things,
first, the Overton Window...

27:49.195 --> 27:54.037
that which is an acceptable part
of the public discourse.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.520
This behavior... our behavior
is so far outside that window

27:56.522 --> 27:58.481
it might as well be
on fucking Mars.

27:58.483 --> 28:00.483
Yeah, but the window
is shifting.

28:00.485 --> 28:02.125
And isn't it
our responsibility to...

28:02.127 --> 28:04.487
You want it
to have shifted.

28:04.489 --> 28:07.450
Maybe it has.
But not that much.

28:07.452 --> 28:11.735
And don't forget: part of you
wants the humiliation.

28:11.737 --> 28:13.937
Needs it. But I don't.

28:13.939 --> 28:17.741
I can't live with it.
I...

28:17.743 --> 28:19.663
I won't live with it.

28:19.665 --> 28:23.066
We cannot take the chance
that Foley is serious.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.388
Oh, he's serious.

28:25.390 --> 28:28.431
Then that's it, Chuck.

28:28.433 --> 28:31.714
And <i>that</i>
you can live with?

28:31.716 --> 28:34.518
Me just capitulating?
In silence.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.200
I can.
And so can you.

28:37.202 --> 28:39.442
You have to.

28:39.444 --> 28:41.484
Walk away.

28:44.970 --> 28:47.850
I just want
to scream, Wend.

28:47.852 --> 28:50.453
At the situation
or at me?

28:50.455 --> 28:52.815
- Yes.
- I know.

28:52.817 --> 28:55.458
And if you need to do that
to move on, then do it.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.980
But then, sure as fuck,
move on...

28:57.982 --> 29:02.906
Okay.

29:02.908 --> 29:06.111
Alright. Okay. Okay.

29:07.872 --> 29:11.154
It'll be okay.

29:11.156 --> 29:14.717
We'll find the next
adventure together.

29:17.642 --> 29:21.485
Be watching at 5 p.m. to
see me bend the hell over.

29:24.409 --> 29:26.411
Hey,
I've seen it before.

29:44.508 --> 29:48.431
- I'm sorry...
- Evan, can I get a moment...

29:48.433 --> 29:50.833
Rebecca.

29:50.835 --> 29:52.435
You know, it's a shame
that branding thing

29:52.437 --> 29:54.439
didn't work out
between our companies.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.719
It's a bad time for me
right now though.

29:56.721 --> 29:59.642
I'm about to do the soft shoe
for a room full

29:59.644 --> 30:01.884
of fucking morons...

30:01.886 --> 30:04.687
I mean my valued
shareholders.

30:04.689 --> 30:07.009
Well, I'm here on
behalf of a certain shareholder.

30:07.011 --> 30:08.891
And believe me,
he's no fucking moron.

30:08.893 --> 30:10.693
In fact, he holds
eleven percent

30:10.695 --> 30:12.255
of your company's
outstanding shares.

30:12.257 --> 30:14.217
Eleven percent...
Bobby Axelrod?

30:14.219 --> 30:15.538
Mm-hmm.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.542
Fuck. Alright.
Just give us a minute...

30:19.464 --> 30:21.546
Come on.
Let's go.

30:23.868 --> 30:25.587
What does he want
to tell me?

30:25.589 --> 30:27.189
It's over.

30:27.191 --> 30:29.031
Over?

30:29.033 --> 30:32.276
Your time as CEO
of Noon to Night.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.399
Yeah, I don't think so.

30:36.401 --> 30:38.160
I believe I can
rally my board

30:38.162 --> 30:40.002
to give me another
few quarters...

30:40.004 --> 30:42.164
No such thing as a "few more
quarters" in this world.

30:42.166 --> 30:43.806
Not your board
anymore either.

30:43.808 --> 30:45.487
I'm here to make you
think again.

30:45.489 --> 30:47.489
Uh, stock price is weak
despite buybacks.

30:47.491 --> 30:49.251
Per store revenue's
in the shitter.

30:49.253 --> 30:52.174
Brand awareness and support
are at all-time lows.

30:52.176 --> 30:53.976
Did you sleep with
a junior VP out of Seattle

30:53.978 --> 30:57.379
at the company retreat?

30:57.381 --> 31:00.062
Hell if I know, but people
are about to start asking...

31:00.064 --> 31:02.066
He wants to take it
to the press?

31:03.027 --> 31:06.228
I'll go to war with Axelrod
any fucking time.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.911
Guy's the Al Capone of
Wall Street for Christ's sake...

31:08.913 --> 31:11.273
Mnh. You won't be
going with him.

31:11.275 --> 31:13.395
You'll be going
to war with <i>me.</i>

31:13.397 --> 31:17.399
He'll sign his shares over and
I will use all my credibility,

31:17.401 --> 31:21.523
all my connections, all those
women who buy all my products

31:21.525 --> 31:24.046
to turn
their fucking backs

31:24.048 --> 31:26.609
on your company.

31:26.611 --> 31:28.250
On you.

31:28.252 --> 31:31.613
So what you need to be
asking yourself is:

31:31.615 --> 31:35.419
what do you want
in your go-bag?

31:37.861 --> 31:39.421
I don't care
if you have to jam it

31:39.423 --> 31:41.222
into your grandmother's
goddamned IRA account.

31:41.224 --> 31:43.144
I. Need. You.

31:43.146 --> 31:46.909
To. Take. It...

31:46.911 --> 31:48.270
Take it.

31:48.272 --> 31:51.273
Fucking take it!
Right fucking now!

31:51.275 --> 31:54.516
Or suffer my wrath forever!

31:54.518 --> 31:57.439
<i>...Fine.
Booked.</i>

31:57.441 --> 32:00.644
<i>But Wags, listen,
you know I hate you now.</i>

32:04.768 --> 32:06.770
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

32:08.652 --> 32:10.372
That's fucking that.

32:10.374 --> 32:13.856
Every single institution on
or attendant to the Street

32:13.858 --> 32:17.699
is gonna be dumping like a dray
horse on an all taco diet.

32:17.701 --> 32:20.662
Yep. But it's gonna be
too late for them...

32:24.027 --> 32:26.307
...AAAAAAaaaand, it's over!

32:26.309 --> 32:30.271
We got out of about 90 percent
of that toxic trash.

32:31.995 --> 32:34.516
Yeah!

32:34.518 --> 32:36.638
Whoo!

32:36.640 --> 32:38.400
Whiskey!

32:38.402 --> 32:41.723
If you don't want to live
in the "about" of it all,

32:41.725 --> 32:44.165
I have specificados.

32:44.167 --> 32:46.408
I'll live in
the "about of it all."

32:46.410 --> 32:48.329
I think I'm responsible

32:48.331 --> 32:51.492
for saving us <i>about</i>
seventy million today!

32:54.858 --> 32:56.898
We took a 48 million dollar
hit today,

32:56.900 --> 33:01.063
instead of eating
the 512 million dollar exposure

33:01.065 --> 33:03.785
we were facing at the open.

33:03.787 --> 33:07.308
All hail
our lords and saviors,

33:07.310 --> 33:12.033
Robert of Axelrod
and Michael of Wagner!

33:22.566 --> 33:24.568
Huh?

33:28.452 --> 33:30.051
Mafee has
the scuttlebutt.

33:30.053 --> 33:33.174
We bled 'em.
Your idea did.

33:33.176 --> 33:35.696
We cost them plenty
by selling when we did

33:35.698 --> 33:38.539
and you saved us
a massive loss in that sector

33:38.541 --> 33:42.263
or at the very least a several
months-long forced hold

33:42.265 --> 33:44.385
by selling before
that terminal went up.

33:44.387 --> 33:47.551
Okay.
Virtual group high five.

33:50.834 --> 33:54.876
Strange confluence of events,
Axe Cap's computers going down

33:54.878 --> 33:57.358
right on the cusp
of a sector-killing

33:57.360 --> 34:00.441
industrial accident,
allowing us an opening.

34:00.443 --> 34:02.443
I agree, it was.

34:02.445 --> 34:03.964
And that's how
I am going to continue

34:03.966 --> 34:05.085
to think of it, you know?

34:05.087 --> 34:06.607
Act of God, as they say.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.289
What's the Russian word
for God?

34:08.291 --> 34:10.293
Good question.

34:11.935 --> 34:14.135
Hey.

34:14.137 --> 34:16.297
Glad I had someone's
guidance this morning.

34:16.299 --> 34:19.460
Hey, I did my job.
You did yours.

34:19.462 --> 34:21.464
That's the way
it oughta go.

34:47.530 --> 34:50.491
...Russian made
circuitry.

34:50.493 --> 34:52.252
It was plugged
into the network.

34:52.254 --> 34:56.176
It has wifi and cellular data
cards, to give it remote access.

34:56.178 --> 34:57.818
And it was powered
off the main outlet,

34:57.820 --> 35:00.183
allowing them to just
wait for the right moment.

35:01.945 --> 35:05.706
Someone who came for a meeting
wasn't who they said they were.

35:05.708 --> 35:08.229
Put a protocol in place
so that can't happen again.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.590
I will.

35:10.753 --> 35:12.673
We're back up!

35:12.675 --> 35:14.677
We know,
you simple fool!

35:15.998 --> 35:17.838
Go run a security audit.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.080
Clear out the whole Admin file
and rebuild it.

35:20.082 --> 35:22.405
And call CyberBuoy to
make sure it's done right.

35:24.207 --> 35:26.489
I'll go supervise.

35:29.772 --> 35:32.012
It is going to be
six months

35:32.014 --> 35:35.135
before we can rebook
our anti-gravity flight...

35:35.137 --> 35:36.777
Gonna be six months before
anybody in the business

35:36.779 --> 35:37.778
talks to us.

35:37.780 --> 35:40.020
But

35:40.022 --> 35:42.022
I feel like I'm fucking
floating right now.

35:42.024 --> 35:43.904
How did you do it?

35:43.906 --> 35:46.587
I showed him the hieroglyphics
on the cave wall and he folded.

35:46.589 --> 35:48.469
For a 13 million dollar
exit payment.

35:48.471 --> 35:50.311
Pennies on
the fucking dollar!

35:50.313 --> 35:52.633
But you're gonna have to force
the board to make good on that.

35:52.635 --> 35:55.636
Uh, shouldn't be hard, since
I got you three board seats...

35:55.638 --> 35:56.877
one of which I'm taking.

35:56.879 --> 35:58.999
Wow. I owe you.

35:59.001 --> 36:00.921
Oh. You do.
And payback's gonna be steep.

36:00.923 --> 36:03.205
Gimme some of that.

36:06.608 --> 36:08.648
You two are animals,
drinking it warm.

36:08.650 --> 36:10.411
- I need some ice.
- Oh. I can...

36:10.413 --> 36:12.415
I'll get it.

36:20.743 --> 36:24.024
Grigor didn't
beat us this time.

36:24.026 --> 36:26.306
He almost did.

36:26.308 --> 36:28.068
But not quite.

36:28.070 --> 36:30.710
He won't stop trying.

36:30.712 --> 36:33.513
No, he won't.

36:33.515 --> 36:37.718
Until all his chances
are taken away.

36:41.443 --> 36:45.165
Fraunces. Fitting.

36:45.167 --> 36:48.008
Washington bid farewell
to his troops here.

36:49.531 --> 36:51.251
Even though I never
got my troops again...

36:51.253 --> 36:53.573
Just the farewell.

36:53.575 --> 36:55.735
I don't see any
other way either.

36:55.737 --> 36:57.537
Yeah.

36:57.539 --> 37:00.380
I go out there. Give up.
Everyone moves on.

37:00.382 --> 37:03.904
Yeah. I wrote it all
down for you.

37:10.432 --> 37:14.394
Let's see here.

37:14.396 --> 37:16.636
...And so for reasons
having more to do with

37:16.638 --> 37:18.718
familial commitments

37:18.720 --> 37:21.721
than a lack of desire
to do the job,

37:21.723 --> 37:24.044
I hereby...

37:24.046 --> 37:26.246
Yup.
That's about it.

37:26.248 --> 37:28.488
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:31.933 --> 37:33.493
Gimme a few alone.

37:33.495 --> 37:35.615
Uh, yeah. I'll get out there,
tell 'em a couple minutes.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.079
Nope. Not gonna read that one.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.528
"A lie," the wise man,

38:49.530 --> 38:51.810
Winston Churchill,
purportedly said,

38:51.812 --> 38:53.852
"gets halfway around the world

38:53.854 --> 38:56.255
before the truth has a chance
to get its pants on."

39:00.982 --> 39:03.262
But, uh, I have a feeling
that this truth

39:03.264 --> 39:04.984
<i>will find its way quick enough.</i>

39:04.986 --> 39:08.267
<i>And it's high time
for truth, too.</i>

39:08.269 --> 39:11.190
<i>For openness. For unburdening.</i>

39:11.192 --> 39:15.354
I am not here, as most
politicians might be,

39:15.356 --> 39:17.076
to ask you to trust me.

39:18.519 --> 39:22.362
No. Instead, I am asking
if I may trust you,

39:22.364 --> 39:27.006
with my deepest fear,

39:27.008 --> 39:29.528
which is that you might know me,

39:29.530 --> 39:32.811
who I really am.

39:32.813 --> 39:35.494
<i>The job of the prosecutor
is to expose that</i>

39:35.496 --> 39:38.697
<i>which is hidden away,
the evil, the dirty,</i>

39:38.699 --> 39:40.539
<i>the crooked
and the untruthful.</i>

39:40.541 --> 39:43.061
To shine light and reveal

39:43.063 --> 39:46.065
<i>what's under all that darkness.</i>

39:46.067 --> 39:50.469
And I have come to realize
that in order to do it right,

39:50.471 --> 39:52.792
I must first shine that light
on my own dark parts.

39:52.794 --> 39:56.915
<i>Which is why I have asked you
all here today.</i>

40:03.444 --> 40:04.883
Alright. Y...
You know what?

40:04.885 --> 40:07.127
I'm just going to say it. Uh...

40:08.969 --> 40:12.171
I... In my private life...

40:14.255 --> 40:16.775
In the confines
of my happy marriage...

40:16.777 --> 40:19.420
with my consenting wife...

40:24.104 --> 40:25.784
practice sadomasochism...

40:29.670 --> 40:32.310
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

40:34.155 --> 40:38.397
Bondage, dominance,
uh, all the rest.

40:41.081 --> 40:44.162
Masks. Binds. Ropes. Fire.

40:49.209 --> 40:53.091
Wow. Uh...

40:53.093 --> 40:55.693
Even just saying it like that
I can feel my shoulders loosen

40:55.695 --> 40:57.255
for the first time in decades.

40:57.257 --> 40:59.058
I am a masochist.

40:59.060 --> 41:01.980
<i>In order to achieve
sexual gratification,</i>

41:01.982 --> 41:05.344
I need to be tied up,
punched, pinched, whipped,

41:05.346 --> 41:07.786
kicked or otherwise tortured.

41:10.270 --> 41:11.830
By my loving wife...

41:20.560 --> 41:23.642
And here's the bigger truth.

41:23.644 --> 41:25.644
All of us need something, right?

41:25.646 --> 41:29.127
<i>You know, I don't know
what you do in your bedroom,</i>

41:29.129 --> 41:31.810
<i>with your loved one,
but I do know this:</i>

41:31.812 --> 41:34.092
<i>you're probably
a little embarrassed about it.</i>

41:34.094 --> 41:36.174
You probably don't want
the rest of us looking at you

41:36.176 --> 41:40.938
while you do it... unless that's
your thing and if so, great.

41:40.940 --> 41:42.700
<i>But wouldn't we
be better off</i>

41:42.702 --> 41:44.902
<i>if we didn't let
shame win.</i>

41:44.904 --> 41:46.425
<i>If we didn't feel sheepish,</i>

41:46.427 --> 41:49.708
didn't feel like we had to hide
what moves us?

41:49.710 --> 41:51.029
Chuck, are you
still gonna run?

41:51.031 --> 41:52.711
Chuck, how...

42:00.280 --> 42:02.240
There are those who believe
that I have just ended

42:02.242 --> 42:05.883
my legal and political careers.

42:05.885 --> 42:09.768
They don't think you can handle
what I just told you.

42:09.770 --> 42:13.011
In fact, uh,
political opponents of mine

42:13.013 --> 42:14.693
were plotting to use it
against me.

42:14.695 --> 42:16.294
I said "bring it."

42:19.699 --> 42:23.021
And that's why I told you
I was here to trust <i>you.</i>

42:25.145 --> 42:27.385
Because I know
that you can handle it.

42:27.387 --> 42:29.266
That you may laugh a little.

42:29.268 --> 42:31.429
But that at the end of the day,
you'll get it,

42:31.431 --> 42:33.591
because you want the truth.

42:35.996 --> 42:39.357
At worst, uh,
maybe it won't stop you

42:39.359 --> 42:41.079
from getting to the polls
to support me.

42:41.081 --> 42:45.163
At best,

42:45.165 --> 42:49.447
maybe on the way you tell
someone who you really are.

42:51.290 --> 42:52.690
Maybe they like it.

42:55.615 --> 42:58.296
And maybe you feel
just a little more comfortable

42:58.298 --> 42:59.818
in your own skin.

43:02.262 --> 43:04.182
As I finally do in mine.

43:09.028 --> 43:10.348
Thank you.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.440
Thank you.

44:03.442 --> 44:04.841
You're welcome.

44:04.843 --> 44:07.444
This cork is symbolic
of the exit polls

44:07.446 --> 44:10.368
popping huge
for Chuck Rhoades,

44:10.370 --> 44:14.211
your next Attorney General
of the State of New York...

44:14.213 --> 44:15.973
The future of justice
in this state.

44:19.298 --> 44:24.181
Here's to all or nothing
gambits... the only way to live.

44:24.183 --> 44:25.782
Hear, hear.

44:27.026 --> 44:29.028
Cheers.

44:36.195 --> 44:38.556
I'm gonna need the room.

44:38.558 --> 44:41.158
Uh.
Sure, of course.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.200
Why don't we, uh, fall back
into the outer office...

44:43.202 --> 44:45.444
That's not gonna be
far enough.

45:00.660 --> 45:03.100
You're a real politician now,
aren't you?

45:03.102 --> 45:05.783
That's right.

45:05.785 --> 45:08.465
But the distinction you failed
to make is:

45:08.467 --> 45:10.747
winning politician.

45:10.749 --> 45:13.550
- At all costs?
- Yes.

45:13.552 --> 45:16.673
Victory at all costs,
victory in spite of all terror,

45:16.675 --> 45:19.235
victory however long and hard
the road may be;

45:19.237 --> 45:21.599
for without victory,
there is no survival.

45:21.601 --> 45:24.121
More Churchill?

45:24.123 --> 45:26.363
You blow up my fucking life
and more Churchill.

45:26.365 --> 45:29.046
You can shove him
up your ass.

45:29.048 --> 45:30.607
And believe me,
he'll fit.

45:30.609 --> 45:33.930
What would you have
had me do, Wend, lose?

45:33.932 --> 45:36.413
Yes, Chuck. Lose.

45:36.415 --> 45:38.615
For once in your fucking life,
you could have taken the L

45:38.617 --> 45:41.698
instead of humiliating me
utterly and absolutely.

45:41.700 --> 45:43.419
Are you sure about that?

45:43.421 --> 45:46.703
That I'm humiliated?
I'm pretty goddamned sure.

45:46.705 --> 45:49.226
How am I supposed to
face my colleagues,

45:49.228 --> 45:51.148
my friends, strangers?

45:51.150 --> 45:52.269
Our children?

45:52.271 --> 45:55.872
Okay.
Eva is too young to know.

45:55.874 --> 45:59.115
And as for Kevin...
at a certain age it becomes time

45:59.117 --> 46:02.959
to see your parents as real
people, not perfect beings...

46:02.961 --> 46:04.881
I'm getting them out of town.
I'm sending them to my parents.

46:04.883 --> 46:07.283
God knows how long
will be long enough...

46:07.285 --> 46:09.205
Well, as for the rest of them,
maybe wait a second.

46:09.207 --> 46:11.210
And see how you poll.

46:12.451 --> 46:14.771
Because they loved
what I had to say out there.

46:14.773 --> 46:16.653
The frank talk.

46:16.655 --> 46:18.214
The numbers
make that clear,

46:18.216 --> 46:20.136
and I can only imagine
that you...

46:20.138 --> 46:22.178
going along for the sake
of your husband...

46:22.180 --> 46:24.821
are gonna be viewed
as hero of the people.

46:24.823 --> 46:26.825
I don't care.

46:27.946 --> 46:30.786
Poll numbers?
You motherfucker.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.628
We discussed this
beforehand.

46:32.630 --> 46:34.671
I made my position
crystal clear,

46:34.673 --> 46:36.953
and you agreed and then you
went off and did it anyway.

46:36.955 --> 46:39.556
I freed us
from the yoke of secrecy,

46:39.558 --> 46:41.798
from Jack fucking Foley.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.720
And I did not just "go off"

46:43.722 --> 46:45.481
so don't just try
to draw this up

46:45.483 --> 46:49.125
like I'm some impulsive,
disorganized amateur.

46:49.127 --> 46:50.606
What?
So you planned it?

46:50.608 --> 46:53.049
You discussed it
with someone?

46:53.051 --> 46:55.453
With your... your campaign
people... Ira?

47:02.461 --> 47:06.903
No. Of course.

47:06.905 --> 47:08.907
You ran it by your daddy,
didn't you?

47:10.829 --> 47:14.470
What, did you have him mark up
that ridiculous speech?

47:14.472 --> 47:18.194
No. He didn't know
exactly what I'd do.

47:18.196 --> 47:22.839
He just... seeded the idea that
maybe I should get my back up.

47:22.841 --> 47:25.882
Because he's a seasoned
political operative.

47:25.884 --> 47:27.403
A power player...

47:27.405 --> 47:29.407
Holy shit, is this marriage
getting crowded.

47:30.088 --> 47:32.929
How many dicks is a woman
expected to have in her face?

47:32.931 --> 47:36.932
Wendy, I am gonna be
Attorney General.

47:36.934 --> 47:39.295
So let's just talk this out
like two rational human...

47:39.297 --> 47:42.818
No. I am done
hearing you talk.

47:54.872 --> 47:56.874
It's all
you say it is, Dad.

47:57.835 --> 47:59.395
Let's do something
with this.

47:59.397 --> 48:01.437
You're gonna help me
raise capital?

48:01.439 --> 48:03.959
I am. I'm going to put things
in motion right away.

48:03.961 --> 48:06.442
Because it's a strong idea,
well executed.

48:06.444 --> 48:10.526
And also because I want to.
For you.

48:14.772 --> 48:18.574
I'm gonna be in business
with my... child.

48:25.302 --> 48:27.463
Congratulations.

48:28.786 --> 48:30.706
You blew the doors off
with that speech.

48:30.708 --> 48:35.631
I did not expect you
to come across with that.

48:35.633 --> 48:37.793
Neither did Wendy,
to be honest.

48:37.795 --> 48:39.875
Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah.

48:39.877 --> 48:41.877
I will have to deal with that.
For certain.

48:41.879 --> 48:44.280
I already am.

48:44.282 --> 48:47.563
Well. She's gonna
beat your ass for it.

48:50.047 --> 48:52.287
That is the first
and last of those.

48:52.289 --> 48:53.809
I doubt that.

48:53.811 --> 48:56.691
Hell, if that's the price
you gotta pay

48:56.693 --> 48:58.494
to move the conversation
along...

48:58.496 --> 49:00.776
Exactly so.

49:00.778 --> 49:04.980
What, uh... What other price
might I be paying?

49:18.355 --> 49:20.395
<i>I saw...</i>

49:20.397 --> 49:23.399
<i>I'm sorry to have seen
Chuck's press conference.</i>

49:23.401 --> 49:26.562
I can't believe...

49:26.564 --> 49:28.003
Look,
I know what it's like

49:28.005 --> 49:30.165
to face public scrutiny
over who you are.

49:30.167 --> 49:33.008
How it must be even worse when
it's been foisted upon you.

49:33.010 --> 49:35.090
But you can still
claim it.

49:35.092 --> 49:38.533
<i>Whatever's transpired
between us,</i>

49:38.535 --> 49:40.735
<i>I can imagine you could use
some support right now...</i>

49:40.737 --> 49:44.379
<i>So, would you like to?
Talk?</i>

49:55.592 --> 49:59.194
Fine. Great.

49:59.196 --> 50:00.555
Thank you.

50:06.523 --> 50:08.403
Thank you.

50:08.405 --> 50:10.325
...And... And it's only

50:10.327 --> 50:13.048
because you threw your support
behind me,

50:13.050 --> 50:16.692
because of your FAITH in me,
that I stand before you now

50:16.694 --> 50:18.173
as the Attorney General

50:18.175 --> 50:21.816
of the finest state
in the Union... New York!

50:29.666 --> 50:31.668
Just beautiful.

50:35.192 --> 50:36.912
- Thank you so much.
- The Governor for you.

50:36.914 --> 50:39.354
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

50:39.356 --> 50:41.358
Thank you.

50:46.563 --> 50:48.403
<i>Congratulations, Chuck.</i>

50:48.405 --> 50:49.924
Can't wait to work
together.

50:49.926 --> 50:52.206
Congratulations to you,
Mr. Governor-elect.

50:52.208 --> 50:54.048
I'm eager
to get started, sir.

50:54.050 --> 50:55.409
You have fun tonight.

51:19.195 --> 51:21.556
- Is it done?
- It is.

51:21.558 --> 51:24.559
Outgoing AG approved it
as a courtesy to you.

51:24.561 --> 51:28.845
I made sure of it
before we scooped him up.

51:33.570 --> 51:35.169
Mr. Andolov.

51:35.171 --> 51:38.773
My first act as Attorney General
of New York State,

51:38.775 --> 51:40.614
even before I'm sworn in,

51:40.616 --> 51:43.737
was to freeze your funds
in the United States.

51:44.941 --> 51:46.861
My second act is:

51:46.863 --> 51:49.346
Inviting you to leave
our sunny shores.

51:50.827 --> 51:55.590
Mr. former US Attorney
and now Attorney General,

51:55.592 --> 51:57.594
congratulations!

51:58.514 --> 52:01.595
There are so many ways
we could have met.

52:01.597 --> 52:05.319
It is unfortunate
you chose this one.

52:08.124 --> 52:12.447
Like the musician says
of the piece he plays:

52:12.449 --> 52:14.088
it chose me.

52:14.090 --> 52:15.450
Did it?

52:15.452 --> 52:19.533
Or are you doing favors
for friends on high?

52:19.535 --> 52:22.336
Because you must know
that I am higher

52:22.338 --> 52:25.259
than any other friend
you could imagine.

52:25.261 --> 52:27.663
And my friends
are higher still.

52:28.824 --> 52:32.025
That notwithstanding,
your business interests

52:32.027 --> 52:34.669
have been connected
with blacklisted governments

52:34.671 --> 52:37.672
and the paperwork is prepared
to have you declared

52:37.674 --> 52:39.674
an unregistered
foreign agent

52:39.676 --> 52:44.358
with intent against ours.

52:44.360 --> 52:47.801
There's only one choice
that will preclude that:

52:47.803 --> 52:50.684
you firing up
your private <i>samolet</i>

52:50.686 --> 52:53.006
and flying home...

52:53.008 --> 52:57.091
or wherever else it is
you call home.

53:05.902 --> 53:07.821
I know much about you.

53:07.823 --> 53:09.583
Both from your own words

53:09.585 --> 53:14.548
and from other...
information I've gathered.

53:14.550 --> 53:18.151
So I know that despite
your predilections,

53:18.153 --> 53:20.874
you are a practical man.

53:20.876 --> 53:23.878
Why don't we combine
those facets

53:23.880 --> 53:26.120
and start
our own friendship?

53:26.122 --> 53:30.524
Take time off
before assuming office.

53:30.526 --> 53:33.046
We will travel to places

53:33.048 --> 53:35.849
that have
certain establishments

53:35.851 --> 53:38.532
you would not believe.

53:42.377 --> 53:44.858
We would come back
refreshed

53:44.860 --> 53:46.981
and with
a whole new outlook

53:46.983 --> 53:50.424
on how we could
work together.

53:52.908 --> 53:57.351
Yeah,

53:57.353 --> 53:59.192
sounds tempting.

54:00.796 --> 54:04.998
You and me,
traveling the continents,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.040
the real world
Lestat and Louis.

54:09.445 --> 54:12.446
Alas, uh...

54:12.448 --> 54:14.608
<i>Ce n'est pas
notre destin.</i>

54:14.610 --> 54:16.690
No?

54:18.454 --> 54:19.613
No.

54:22.177 --> 54:23.897
Depressing.

54:23.899 --> 54:26.179
Mm.

54:26.181 --> 54:29.622
A bit. Yes.

54:29.624 --> 54:32.865
Now,

54:32.867 --> 54:35.509
I'd give you twenty-four hours
to blow town,

54:35.511 --> 54:40.514
but you're too tricky, so I'm
only gonna make it twelve,

54:40.516 --> 54:44.680
before I file the papers
and you'll be removed by force.

54:49.604 --> 54:51.925
Americans pretend to lead,

54:51.927 --> 54:55.848
but they are still provincial
in so many ways.

54:55.850 --> 54:58.212
It is truly sad.

54:58.214 --> 54:59.693
Mm.

55:35.250 --> 55:39.572
I, of course,
picked up the scent

55:39.574 --> 55:42.094
of the Axelrod
behind this.

55:42.096 --> 55:45.180
As I did your recent attack
on my systems.

55:46.822 --> 55:49.983
But you shouldn't
consider this as an attack.

55:49.985 --> 55:53.706
Rhoades gave you
a warning.

55:53.708 --> 55:56.429
He's letting you leave.

55:56.431 --> 55:58.471
That's a favor to me.

55:58.473 --> 56:01.113
And a favor to you.
I hope you understand that.

56:01.115 --> 56:03.396
What I don't understand

56:03.398 --> 56:06.879
fits on a fucking
Bazooka comic.

56:06.881 --> 56:10.083
Then here's one more thing
for you to get your mind around.

56:10.085 --> 56:14.527
I can be scared.
But I cannot be scared off.

56:14.529 --> 56:16.049
Sure.

56:16.051 --> 56:20.014
More, uh, Chuck Wepner
than Michael Spinks.

56:21.576 --> 56:23.856
But they both lost
in the end.

56:23.858 --> 56:27.339
Because they were underprepared
and overmatched. I'm neither.

56:27.341 --> 56:29.181
That is what
Mr. Spinks thought

56:29.183 --> 56:32.544
right up to 91st second
of round one.

56:32.546 --> 56:35.148
Probably did.

56:35.150 --> 56:36.829
But he couldn't do
what I can.

56:36.831 --> 56:40.473
And what is that?
Move like Jagger?

56:40.475 --> 56:44.957
Give away the kind of parting
gift that I'm about to:

56:44.959 --> 56:48.801
the few billion that you have
at Taylor Mason Capital

56:48.803 --> 56:52.404
will be unfrozen
and released back to you...

56:52.406 --> 56:55.287
once you land back home.

56:55.289 --> 56:57.010
That's something.

56:57.012 --> 57:00.573
But it is actually
my money

57:00.575 --> 57:03.336
you're giving back
to me.

57:03.338 --> 57:06.058
I'm not sure how much
gratitude that buys.

57:06.060 --> 57:07.460
Do you want it or not?

57:07.462 --> 57:09.862
Yeah, sure.
Will I get it?

57:09.864 --> 57:13.065
You will. The moment you land.
As I said.

57:13.067 --> 57:15.069
Good.

57:16.310 --> 57:17.669
Grigor.

57:17.671 --> 57:21.154
Listen,
here's the thing:

57:21.156 --> 57:23.436
after the cash
hits your account,

57:23.438 --> 57:27.560
you may start feeling that you
didn't get your satisfaction,

57:27.562 --> 57:31.524
that you have some further score
you want to settle with me.

57:31.526 --> 57:33.806
You're gonna want
to tamp down that feeling.

57:33.808 --> 57:36.048
Sure. It's true

57:36.050 --> 57:39.011
I didn't have you do
my killing for me.

57:39.013 --> 57:41.053
But don't let that trick you
into thinking

57:41.055 --> 57:44.496
that I don't have
the will or the ability

57:44.498 --> 57:46.819
to do it under
different circumstances.

57:46.821 --> 57:49.822
Like
when I'm threatened...

57:49.824 --> 57:52.384
You send someone
after me here,

57:52.386 --> 57:55.067
they're gonna find that
I'm a very insulated, protected

57:55.069 --> 57:57.429
and powerful man
in these fucking parts.

57:57.431 --> 58:01.713
And there is nothing that I
won't do to defend what's mine.

58:01.715 --> 58:06.119
You know,
I don't think I will.

58:07.641 --> 58:09.402
I rather like the idea

58:09.404 --> 58:13.686
of you stalking around,
stirring shit up.

58:13.688 --> 58:16.128
But here. In America.

58:16.130 --> 58:20.692
On the other hand,
if you come to Russia

58:20.694 --> 58:25.457
or any of her territories,
then, Axe,

58:25.459 --> 58:28.139
all bets are off.

58:28.141 --> 58:31.463
You know,
I don't think I will.

58:31.465 --> 58:33.225
Good.

58:33.227 --> 58:35.547
Good.
