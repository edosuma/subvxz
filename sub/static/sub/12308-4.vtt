WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:04.755
What are we doing?

00:04.838 --> 00:07.174
Exploring the pegasus galaxy, it's what we do.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.175
You know what I meant.

00:08.217 --> 00:12.679
There certainly doesn't appear to be anything here that would help in our fight against the wraith

00:12.721 --> 00:14.056
or the replicators.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.225
Come on, you guys kill me.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.018
Planets are huge, you know.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.270
Usually you're the one complaining.

00:20.479 --> 00:24.358
Yes, this enthusiasm is most unlike you, rodney.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.776
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.111
We did a standard fly-over in the jumper

00:28.111 --> 00:30.489
scanned for life-signs. Nothing.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.492
You can't fly around for 10 minutes and decide there's nothing here.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.785
Yes, I can.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.495
I'm getting strange energy readings.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.914
Yeah? From where?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.582
I can't pinpoint the source.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.084
The jungle's pretty thick, though.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.627
It could be hiding just about anything.

00:43.669 --> 00:44.837
I don't know.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.589
It's almost as if somebody in a warm cozy room

00:47.589 --> 00:48.715
typing at their computer

00:48.757 --> 00:50.926
sent us here for their own amusement.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.636
You don't really think zelenka would do that?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.513
If he did, he's going to be sorry.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.933
Do you have any idea how many gate addresses there are in the ancient database

00:57.933 --> 00:59.685
that have no accompanying description?

00:59.726 --> 01:00.978
42?

01:01.061 --> 01:04.313
No, I think it's a little more than that. Look, I don't really remember. That's not the point.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.107
Nothing

01:05.232 --> 01:07.317
No information at all. I say

01:07.401 --> 01:08.527
that has to mean something.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.363
Maybe it means there was nothing worth writing about on those planets.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.573
Or there is

01:12.614 --> 01:14.324
but the ancients are trying to hide it.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.534
From themselves?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.078
A lot of time has passed since the ancients were around.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.706
You know, things change. Maybe there's something here they didn't know about.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.833
You have a bet riding on this, don't you?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.334
What makes you say that?

01:28.755 --> 01:29.756
All right...

01:30.215 --> 01:31.133
That's it.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.012
I'm calling this one. Everyone back to the jumper.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.221
Aw, come on.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.348
Face it, mckay, you lost this one.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.769
Hello, what's that then, huh?

01:47.357 --> 01:51.236
Looks like some kind of natural crystalline growth.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.655
I think this might be what's causing the energy readings.

01:53.739 --> 01:54.781
Pretty.

01:54.990 --> 01:58.368
Looks like one of those toys you play with when you're a kid.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.661
A commodore 64?

01:59.745 --> 02:01.330
Triple barrel shotgun?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.248
A kaleidoscope.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.499
You realize what this means?

02:04.708 --> 02:07.169
We discovered an alien fungus that glows.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.756
How about a power source that literally grows on trees?

02:13.509 --> 02:15.677
But admittedly, these energy readings are pretty low-level, but

02:15.677 --> 02:17.554
if these crystals could be cultivated, then--

02:17.554 --> 02:19.681
whoa, whoa, wait. What are you doing?

02:25.229 --> 02:26.271
Are you all right?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.773
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just

02:27.773 --> 02:28.690
a little shock.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.859
That could have been dangerous! I told you it was giving off energy.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.861
Honestly, I...

02:32.945 --> 02:34.863
I don't know why I did that.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.283
Well, you killed it.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.326
Oh, really?

02:39.368 --> 02:40.786
Well, it's not giving off energy anymore.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.120
Well, maybe he just scared it.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.830
You don't even know if it was alive.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.749
Seriously, why would you touch it?

02:45.749 --> 02:48.126
I don't know! I said that, okay?

02:48.126 --> 02:49.628
I just did.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.797
Now, will you leave it at that?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.216
Okay, well, there's got to be more of them around here.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.928
I'm going to recommend sending a science team back here to check it out.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.513
I am a science team.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.978
Okay, fine,

03:06.061 --> 03:08.522
let's desert a potentially significant discovery

03:08.522 --> 03:11.066
just because you guys don't want me to win a bet with zelenka?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.072
All your scans are clear

03:17.155 --> 03:18.866
blood tests are normal.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.659
As far as I can tell, you're in perfect health.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.578
See? I told you.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.412
Thanks, doc.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.873
No more touching strange things.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
Well, that's good advice.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.752
I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.087
It's been a long day.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.422
Well, thanks for hanging out.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.215
Just wanted to make sure.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.967
I'm fine.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.260
Get some sleep.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.014
Good night, john.

{c:$ffff00}Doppelganger

05:12.271 --> 05:13.897
This is pretty good.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.440
What is it?

05:17.192 --> 05:19.570
I knew you two were going to eventually hook up.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.405
We are not hooking up.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.322
It's just dinner.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.659
I'm telling you, there's something in here giving off a strange energy reading.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.745
John, what are you doing?

05:29.079 --> 05:31.415
Colonel carter doesn't trust you.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.667
No one does but me.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.836
What are you talking about?

05:35.878 --> 05:37.504
What's wrong with you?

05:38.297 --> 05:40.299
What do you mean? Nothing.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.886
You've never been the same since you got into the mind of that wraith queen.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.846
What?

05:47.931 --> 05:49.391
Teyla!

05:50.392 --> 05:51.727
Father?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.918
I cannot even begin to tell you how bizarre it was.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.462
- Please, you want bizarre? Let me tell you--
- you know what?

06:18.629 --> 06:20.380
Don'T.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.174
Morning.

06:26.094 --> 06:26.762
What?

06:26.762 --> 06:27.971
Teyla had a dream about you last night.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.097
Rodney...

06:29.223 --> 06:30.432
really?

06:30.724 --> 06:31.892
What was it about?

06:32.017 --> 06:35.103
Actually, it was more of a nightmare, and I'd rather not talk about it.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.565
Was i the dashing hero saving you from a big bad monster?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.526
Actually, you were the big bad monster.

06:40.609 --> 06:41.318
Really?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.570
Like I said, I'd rather not talk about it.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.989
Where are you going?

06:46.156 --> 06:48.367
I'm sorry. I have a headache.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.786
I did not sleep well last night.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.998
Is she really mad at me?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.628
I can't control what's in her dreams.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.089
Really? You think you can't control a person's dreams?

07:02.172 --> 07:05.175
My father read me moby dick when I was seven years old.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.885
I mean, seriously, what was the man thinking?

07:06.927 --> 07:10.472
You have any idea how long I had nightmares about being eaten by a whale?

07:11.056 --> 07:13.267
- They haven't stopped, have they?
- No.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.146
It's coming from outside.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.108
I go to the opening. I hear darts.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.151
I pull open the tent, and

07:23.193 --> 07:24.528
he comes inside.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.822
I know it's not really colonel sheppard,

07:26.989 --> 07:30.284
but I can't help but feel different towards him.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.955
Do you think it's my subconscious trying to tell me something?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.499
If there is something real going on between you and colonel sheppard

07:37.541 --> 07:39.334
that you feel you need to address

07:39.334 --> 07:41.253
you definitely should.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.589
Otherwise, don't let it bother you.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.385
I've had horrible nightmares before

07:48.677 --> 07:51.180
Of my father being taken when I was a little girl,

07:51.221 --> 07:53.098
the cullings since,

07:53.265 --> 07:55.267
but none of them have felt like this.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.102
When I woke up,

07:57.144 --> 07:59.521
I could barely catch my breath.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.773
I know it sounds silly, but

08:01.815 --> 08:05.068
I think I'm actually afraid of falling asleep.

08:07.863 --> 08:11.450
Well, physically, there's nothing wrong with you.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.410
Other than the symptoms you've described,

08:13.410 --> 08:15.662
which can all be attributed to lack of sleep.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.498
These should help for the short term,

08:18.874 --> 08:21.710
but if the problem persists

08:21.793 --> 08:23.670
you definitely need to come back

08:23.754 --> 08:28.008
You have no idea how good the thought of a solid night's sleep makes me feel at this point.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.718
Oh, I think I do.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.054
I'm not sure I've had one since I got here.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.347
Thank you.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.597
Don't mention it.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.683
- Have a good night.
- You too.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.232
Dr. Keller,  we have a medical emergency.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.444
Dr. Keller, please report  immediately to the infirmary.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.000
What's wrong?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.919
It's teyla. She's in severe abdominal distress.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.420
Says you gave her some medication?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.798
I prescribed some ambien to help her sleep. Teyla?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.093
Went to the mess for a late-night snack,

09:11.134 --> 09:14.388
she started complaining about her stomach, and then she just doubled over.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.641
I thought you were going to bed. Did you take one of those pills I gave you?

09:17.724 --> 09:18.183
No.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.018
Okay, just try to relax. Let me have a look.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.023
Hold her for me.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.031
Oh, my god.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.078
Doctor, do something.

09:38.954 --> 09:42.457
okay, we-we need to sedate her, and, uh--

09:47.754 --> 09:49.506
Oh, god.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.930
Can you believe this?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.175
Sorry, doc.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.718
Didn't mean to scare you.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.262
We were sparring. I got in a lucky shot.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.389
It's the middle of the night.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.058
Maybe for you.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.602
Sit down, let me have a look.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.608
You're going to need stitches.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.860
I guess I taught him too much, huh?

10:51.944 --> 10:53.529
Yeah, I guess so.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.156
You know, you don't need to stick around. I'm fine.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.533
- You sure?
- Yeah.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.243
I want a rematch tomorrow, though.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.994
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

11:01.870 --> 11:02.871
Good night.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.581
See you tomorrow.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.877
Something wrong?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.838
Hmm? No, nothing.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.551
I don't think he's seeing anyone, you know--

11:15.551 --> 11:17.052
oh! Oh, no. No,

11:17.135 --> 11:18.971
that'S... that's quite all right.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.766
You know, this would be easier if you lay down.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.226
Okay.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.465
Hello!

12:05.350 --> 12:07.227
Is anyone here?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.076
Anyone!

13:04.868 --> 13:06.495
Hey, buddy...

13:06.787 --> 13:08.121
what are you running from?

13:08.914 --> 13:10.499
I don't know.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.917
Come on.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.614
I'm really sorry. Did I... did I hurt you?

13:44.908 --> 13:46.743
No. No... I'M...

13:47.035 --> 13:48.453
I'm sorry.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.122
I didn't mean to...

13:50.414 --> 13:51.957
you fell asleep.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.293
I was having the strangest dream.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.461
You sure you're okay?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.464
Yeah.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.550
Go ahead.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.428
I'm almost done.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.101
It was terrifying.

14:11.185 --> 14:14.855
There you were with this disgusting alien bug crawling out of your stomach

14:14.938 --> 14:18.317
and colonel sheppard was acting like it was the coolest thing he'd ever seen.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.651
That sounds like that movie.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.069
Yeah, alien. Have you seen it?

14:21.111 --> 14:22.696
Colonel sheppard speaks of it often.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.489
I still remember the first time I saw it.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.533
I certainly did not think it was cool.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.910
One time, in med school,

14:27.951 --> 14:31.246
I made the mistake of confiding to my partner in biology class

14:31.246 --> 14:33.874
that it had caused my all-time worst nightmares.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.043
He actually planted a live snake

14:36.043 --> 14:38.003
inside a cadaver I was working on.

14:38.212 --> 14:39.588
Well, I never saw it as a kid.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.548
I knew from the poster it was going to be too scary.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.716
No, I was 16

14:42.716 --> 14:48.055
when a neighborhood theater had a horror revival festival.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.723
I thought, great, you know,

14:49.765 --> 14:51.517
date movie. So, jocelyn rutger

14:51.517 --> 14:53.101
third period science

14:53.143 --> 14:55.896
Bit of geek, but she had a great, uh...

14:56.063 --> 14:59.691
anyway, you know how girls get all scared and curl up on your shoulder?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.860
Your planet has some truly strange rituals.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.862
Anyway, I eat when I get nervous.

15:03.904 --> 15:04.530
Really?

15:04.530 --> 15:06.615
- I hadn't noticed.
- Mm... so,

15:06.907 --> 15:08.492
very tense, working like a charm.

15:08.492 --> 15:11.537
Jocelyn's all freaked out beside me, I'm packing away the goobers and the popcorn

15:11.912 --> 15:14.706
and then the alien bursts out of john hurt.

15:14.706 --> 15:15.916
You didn'T.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.960
puked all over her.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.087
I have got to see this movie.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.297
Don't you think it's strange

15:22.339 --> 15:24.967
that each of us has had incredibly vivid nightmares

15:24.967 --> 15:27.678
with colonel sheppard being somehow an integral part?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.930
Acting most unlike colonel sheppard.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.098
Not me

15:31.348 --> 15:32.933
Have you had any nightmares recently?

15:32.933 --> 15:34.101
Not a night goes by.

15:34.101 --> 15:37.729
Last night, I dreamt that colonel carter invited me to her quarters for dinner.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.898
Maybe you shouldn't be telling us this, rodney.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.442
Yeah, I said nightmare, not delusional male fantasy.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.403
Wait and listen.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.697
Turns out she was serving lemon chicken.

15:46.905 --> 15:47.823
I mean, lemon,

15:47.906 --> 15:51.451
and the only reason she invited me to dinner was to tell me she was promoting zelenka over me.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.453
That's it?

15:53.954 --> 15:55.038
Then I was eaten by a whale.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.415
Don't ask how that happened.

15:56.707 --> 15:58.792
Okay, do you guys really think I'm crazy?

15:58.834 --> 16:01.336
I realize they're just dreams, but

16:01.420 --> 16:04.298
first it was teyla, then right after you came to see me, I had one.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.259
And that's when mine stopped. Those pills you gave me knocked me out cold.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.469
And then ronon had one while I worked on him.

16:09.553 --> 16:10.804
What's the big deal?

16:10.846 --> 16:13.515
It's like you said, it's just a few bad dreams, right?

16:21.440 --> 16:23.025
I probably shouldn't have bothered you with this.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.194
I know I don't really have any hard evidence.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.156
Well, believe me, I've seen a good hunch go a long way in some pretty crazy circumstances.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.993
I'd always rather you were on your toes, especially with anything that seems suspicious.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.330
I know a few bad dreams isn't that significant.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.333
It's only natural, given what we face on a daily basis, but

16:39.458 --> 16:40.834
this was different.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.336
It really rattled me.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.296
Coupled with the sequential pattern.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.089
First teyla, then me

16:46.173 --> 16:50.594
then ronon, all with colonel sheppard being a significant negative presence in our dreams.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.888
Do you have any idea what's behind it?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.306
No, I don't know.

16:54.348 --> 16:58.894
Thing is, it started right after colonel sheppard touched that crystal on m3x-387.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.521
I thought you cleared him medically.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.688
- I did, but--
- excuse me.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.023
There's an emergency situation at crew quarters atrium.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.026
Security was called for and has been dispatched.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.237
Thank you. Excuse me.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.493
Put down the gun, major.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.079
Let's talk this out.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.039
Someone, get an arg. Now.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.040
Shoot him with it.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.250
Major, talk to me.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.459
Tell me what's going on?

17:22.459 --> 17:23.836
Just do it!

17:24.294 --> 17:25.753
Okay, w-what's the harm?

17:25.753 --> 17:27.881
I mean, if he's human, it won't hurt him, right?

17:27.881 --> 17:31.134
- John, what is he talking about?
- Don't talk to him.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.387
Colonel sheppard is a replicator.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.524
Look, lorne, I don't know what's gotten into you...

17:45.524 --> 17:46.400
me?

17:46.525 --> 17:48.068
No, no, no, no, it's not me.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.988
Major, how about you lower your weapon?

17:50.988 --> 17:52.614
He's a replicator!

17:54.283 --> 17:56.869
What, you don't believe me? I'll shoot him, you'll see.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.163
that won't be necessary. I've got my hands up

18:00.205 --> 18:02.124
in a very non-threatening way.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.667
I've called for an arg.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.045
- You believe him?
- Of course not

18:07.045 --> 18:09.840
but it won't hurt you, and it might help him to lower his gun.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.717
You're one of them, too.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.596
Don't just stand there! Shoot them. Shoot both of them!

18:27.691 --> 18:31.278
I take it I don't have to shoot either of you with this?

18:35.449 --> 18:37.326
I'm so glad no one was hurt.

18:37.451 --> 18:38.827
And you don't remember anything?

18:38.911 --> 18:39.620
No.

18:39.620 --> 18:43.207
I haven't had a sleepwalking  incident since I was, like, 10.

18:43.498 --> 18:46.293
It's quite common for someone suffering from somnambulism

18:46.293 --> 18:49.129
to perform complex activities in their sleep

18:49.213 --> 18:51.089
and remember nothing upon waking.

18:51.131 --> 18:55.260
So you think this has something to do with the crystal I touched?

18:55.511 --> 18:57.012
That's when it seemed to start.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.931
Major lorne's not the only one.

18:59.223 --> 19:04.436
In each case, the person being affected reports you being a significant negative presence in the nightmare.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.563
Well, I can't control that.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.274
No, but maybe something is.

19:10.025 --> 19:10.776
What?

19:10.859 --> 19:13.737
You think someone's impersonating me in their dreams?

19:13.862 --> 19:17.950
Look, I've seen more than my share of alien entities that are capable of this.

19:18.242 --> 19:22.621
Colonel o'neill was once knocked unconscious by an energy being that lived in crystal form.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.623
It took on his appearance for a while.

19:24.623 --> 19:27.543
I read at one point, you were taken over by an alien entity.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.503
Yeah.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.630
Not a personal highlight.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.590
The question is, what's the point?

19:33.841 --> 19:35.884
Maybe it's feeding on our fear.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.347
I'll shut up.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.140
No, no, it's not that big a leap.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.267
It's just...

19:43.392 --> 19:45.018
we don't have any proof.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.687
First, it was teyla.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.397
I was next, and then

19:48.647 --> 19:50.899
ronon after I treated him...

19:50.941 --> 19:54.653
well, I'm the one who touched the crystal, and I've never had a bad dream.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.781
Maybe that's why you're appearing in everyone's dreams.

19:58.574 --> 20:01.869
Whatever's doing this imprinted your image onto itself.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.955
Now that I think about it, it's possible whatever this is,

20:04.955 --> 20:07.457
its spread may be limited by touch.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.500
Okay

20:08.542 --> 20:12.462
anyone who's had contact with major lorne since the incident needs to be isolated.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.465
If this is some sort of alien influence,

20:15.507 --> 20:17.926
we have to find a way to detect it.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.599
Sit down, rodney.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.475
I'm good right here, thank you.

20:25.726 --> 20:29.771
All off-world teams have been contacted and instructed not to return for the time being.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.733
Gate travel will be restricted to an as-needed basis,

20:32.733 --> 20:35.903
and until further notice, all non-essential expedion members

20:35.944 --> 20:37.362
will be restricted to quarters.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.239
Come on, is this really necessary?

20:39.448 --> 20:40.908
It's just a few bad dreams, right?

20:40.949 --> 20:42.075
The fact is,

20:42.117 --> 20:44.369
we don't really know what we're dealing with.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.413
We may have an alien entity on our hands

20:46.413 --> 20:49.041
capable of moving from person to person at will.

20:49.208 --> 20:53.337
And so far, the only behavior we have to evaluate suggests a certain malice.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.214
Now, based on what's been described to me,

20:55.214 --> 20:58.217
the personification of colonel sheppard in everyone's dreams is

20:58.258 --> 21:00.761
behaving much like a sociopath.

21:00.761 --> 21:01.803
Did I have a goatee?

21:01.845 --> 21:04.556
Right now, all it's doing is causing some nightmares

21:04.806 --> 21:07.142
but we don't know if that's the limit of its capability.

21:07.351 --> 21:09.520
You're saying this is only the beginning.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.314
I've never profiled anything like this before.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.024
It will likely progress,

21:14.107 --> 21:16.735
try to drive up the stakes, seek bigger thrills.

21:16.777 --> 21:20.781
Now, even if it's limited to manipulating the host's subconscious,

21:21.031 --> 21:23.492
it may be able to put someone in serious jeopardy.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.661
So, what are we talking, freddy krueger here?

21:25.702 --> 21:29.373
Oh, come on! We don't have a single shred of hard evidence here.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.333
I mean, until we do, this thing is just a bogeyman.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.210
Exactly why you're going back to the planet

21:33.210 --> 21:34.795
where colonel sheppard touched the crystal.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.712
What?

21:35.712 --> 21:36.588
Why would we do that?

21:36.630 --> 21:37.840
Well, just as you said,

21:37.881 --> 21:39.758
to gather some hard evidence

21:39.883 --> 21:41.844
see if there are any more of these things.

21:42.052 --> 21:45.430
We need to find out exactly what they are, and how they work,

21:45.514 --> 21:50.018
and if possible, how to detect if there really is something inside lorne right now.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.855
Thank you.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.152
But-but you said no more gate travel.

21:59.236 --> 22:00.946
I thought that was a wise decision.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.115
I said on an as-needed basis, mckay.

22:03.115 --> 22:04.074
I think this qualifies.

22:04.074 --> 22:06.285
Yeah, but don't you think a science team would be better suited for--

22:06.285 --> 22:08.453
you are a science team, remember?

22:08.871 --> 22:10.998
Okay, fine, but it's a big planet, you know.

22:10.998 --> 22:13.250
We could really use some more manpower.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.796
I still can't believe you're making me do this.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.590
Ah, you lost the bet.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.717
There's definitely something on this planet.

22:21.884 --> 22:24.052
Yes, but I distinctly said "of value."

22:24.178 --> 22:27.347
I hardly call this particular discovery valuable.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.017
Over here.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.062
There you go.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.397
Better get started.

22:35.939 --> 22:40.110
[Muttering in czech]

22:40.319 --> 22:42.321
- Rodney...
- hmm?

22:43.030 --> 22:44.072
Don't look in it,

22:44.114 --> 22:45.741
and whatever you do, don't touch it.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.035
I wasn't even thinking about it.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.245
Radek, we got a live one here.

22:50.996 --> 22:52.831
It could be useful to compare the two.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.333
That's just what I was thinking.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.920
But be careful. It could be dangerous to try to harvest one with an active entity in it.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.506
Once again, you've read my mind. However,

23:00.589 --> 23:02.841
when you're finished there, I say you give it a shot.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.097
Yeah, give it a shot.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.938
You really think it was safe to bring a live one back?

23:16.063 --> 23:18.065
Those containment tanks are non-conductive.

23:18.649 --> 23:21.276
We believe it needs conductive material in order to travel.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.654
And having an active crystal

23:23.946 --> 23:26.615
allows us to calibrate these hand-held sensors

23:26.657 --> 23:29.535
to detect the energy signatures associated with it.

23:29.618 --> 23:32.913
Hopefully, we'll be able to determine if someone is carrying one of these creatures inside of them.

23:32.955 --> 23:34.998
As long as it doesn't know what we're up to.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.751
Otherwise, you'd think it would just transfer out of somebody before we could scan them.

23:37.751 --> 23:41.046
You're assuming they're not only capable, but they're conscious and aware at all times.

23:41.088 --> 23:44.132
It's demonstrated pretty sophisticated intelligence so far.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.301
You think it would have basic avoidance skills.

23:46.552 --> 23:49.555
We're going to have to modify our scanners to operate at a range large enough to...

23:49.763 --> 23:50.973
wait a minute

23:51.223 --> 23:54.476
- we could calibrate the city-wide life-signs detector--
- oh, yes, mr. Wizard,

23:54.476 --> 23:56.770
we're just going to snap our fingers and--

23:56.895 --> 23:58.313
what are you doing?

23:58.689 --> 24:00.148
I don't know, it'S..

24:00.607 --> 24:02.109
it's mesmerizing.

24:02.484 --> 24:03.777
You said it was safe.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.946
We said we think. Still...

24:05.946 --> 24:07.906
I don't know what I was doing.

24:07.990 --> 24:11.368
I can't believe it. I was suddenly overcome by the compulsion to want to touch it.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.328
Yeah, we think that's how it...

24:13.495 --> 24:15.247
ropes in its victims.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.975
It's not in him.

24:35.267 --> 24:38.103
You said the entity needed conductive material to travel, right?

24:38.103 --> 24:39.980
Well, based on the...

24:40.439 --> 24:42.024
it's the power conduits.

24:42.149 --> 24:43.650
They run pretty much through the entire city.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.527
It could be in anyone.

24:47.613 --> 24:48.906
Kate,

24:48.989 --> 24:50.490
what are you doing?

24:50.616 --> 24:52.743
I don't want to die.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.329
Good. Come down from there.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.752
I can'T.

25:02.377 --> 25:03.795
Why not?

25:04.338 --> 25:05.923
Help me, please!

25:08.258 --> 25:09.968
John, stop it.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.386
Stop it. I have to help her!

25:11.428 --> 25:12.596
What are you doing?

25:12.596 --> 25:13.764
John, get out of the way!

25:13.764 --> 25:15.140
Teyla!

25:15.641 --> 25:16.391
Teyla!

25:16.391 --> 25:18.143
Kate!

25:33.367 --> 25:36.245
She did not report for duty and I can't wake her up.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.634
She's dead.

26:08.485 --> 26:09.820
This is colonel carter.

26:09.862 --> 26:12.072
If I could have  your attention, please.

26:13.282 --> 26:18.370
I'm very sorry  to have to tell you  that we have lost  a valuable member  of the expedition today.

26:19.121 --> 26:22.291
Dr. Kate heightmeyer meant  a great deal to all of us.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.711
Her death  is nothing short of tragic.

26:27.129 --> 26:31.008
I'm also sorry  to have to report  that the threat we face  is still in our midst,

26:31.175 --> 26:32.593
and until further notice,

26:32.593 --> 26:35.220
the full lockdown protocol  will remain in effect.

26:37.014 --> 26:38.724
Try to remain calm.

26:38.807 --> 26:42.561
We are doing everything we can  to ensure everyone's safety

26:42.853 --> 26:45.355
and to resolve this situation  quickly.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.233
Thank you.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.617
That was good.

26:56.909 --> 26:58.243
I mean,

26:58.368 --> 27:00.370
horrible, obviously.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.414
Terrifying and horrible,

27:02.414 --> 27:03.999
but I just...

27:04.458 --> 27:06.752
I meant you sounded strong.

27:07.753 --> 27:11.048
I'm sure they were at least a little reassured hearing your voice

27:11.798 --> 27:14.426
but you don't need me to tell you that.

27:15.761 --> 27:17.846
A day like this, it doesn't hurt.

27:20.516 --> 27:21.934
Thanks

27:37.658 --> 27:39.868
I was just about to come to see you, but

27:39.952 --> 27:42.371
I wasn't sure if you wanted to see me.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.892
Uh, colonel carter? Excuse me.

28:03.892 --> 28:06.311
I think I've managed to calibrate the city-wide sensors.

28:09.815 --> 28:12.150
I mean, if it is working properly.

28:12.192 --> 28:15.404
We had some trouble with the...

28:18.156 --> 28:19.867
we have a positive reading.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.786
Do we know who that is?

28:30.460 --> 28:31.879
What do you need me for?

28:32.254 --> 28:33.589
What's with the rubber walls?

28:33.797 --> 28:35.132
I'm sorry, rodney.

28:35.257 --> 28:36.341
I have to go.

28:37.551 --> 28:40.262
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.613
It's in rodney?

28:57.863 --> 29:00.240
The isolation room has been lined with insulating material

29:00.240 --> 29:03.410
to prevent the entity from transferring out of him and into someone else.

29:04.286 --> 29:05.370
If we're right,

29:05.412 --> 29:07.039
we've got it trapped.

29:07.039 --> 29:09.124
Yeah, well, that doesn't help mckay much, does it?

29:09.208 --> 29:11.877
If this thing kills people in their sleep...

29:12.044 --> 29:13.879
we've got to find a way to get it out of him.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.757
Someone want to  get me some coffee?  I'm already feeling  a little tired here.

29:17.341 --> 29:19.676
I could give him something to keep him awake for a while, but

29:19.676 --> 29:23.430
it will only work for so long before we start putting him at risk of pulmonary failure.

29:23.514 --> 29:26.808
Yeah, believe it or not, I've been there before, too.

29:26.892 --> 29:27.851
Do what you can.

29:27.851 --> 29:29.603
We'll try to come up with something.

29:30.145 --> 29:31.480
Hang in there, mckay!

29:31.605 --> 29:32.940
Oh, thanks.

29:32.981 --> 29:34.775
Like I have much choice.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.664
Do you think it knows it's trapped?

29:48.747 --> 29:49.998
I don't know, why?

29:53.126 --> 29:55.796
Maybe there's a way to...

29:56.630 --> 29:58.674
I don't know, reason with it.

29:59.466 --> 30:02.177
Being in dr. Weir's old office made you think of that, didn't it?

30:02.177 --> 30:04.596
Normally I just shoot the bad guys.

30:05.222 --> 30:06.390
We just heard.

30:06.390 --> 30:07.808
There must to be something we can do.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.768
That's what we're talking about.

30:10.185 --> 30:13.480
Okay, let's say for a second that you could somehow communicate with it.

30:13.772 --> 30:14.857
What were you planning on saying?

30:14.857 --> 30:16.608
I don't know, I hadn't gotten that far.

30:16.984 --> 30:20.237
It strikes me that if it feeds on fear, or worse,

30:20.279 --> 30:22.531
likes the thrill of killing its host, then...

30:24.408 --> 30:26.243
well, it would take the last chance it had.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.161
To kill mckay.

30:31.540 --> 30:32.749
What about survival?

30:33.125 --> 30:34.543
It's trapped.

30:34.835 --> 30:37.504
Will it die without a living host to transfer to?

30:37.546 --> 30:39.131
I was hoping not to find out.

30:39.298 --> 30:41.175
We could give it a chance to leave.

30:41.175 --> 30:42.050
Go home.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.261
- Back into the crystal.
- Yeah, sure, why not?

30:44.469 --> 30:46.889
Send it through the gate back to its planet.

30:47.014 --> 30:50.601
I have heard of people being talked through waking dreams before.

30:50.642 --> 30:51.977
Maybe...

30:52.186 --> 30:54.730
maybe mckay can be hypnotized into

30:54.813 --> 30:56.857
a state where he could somehow communicate with it.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.943
He has successfully meditated into an altered state before.

31:00.027 --> 31:01.904
Yeah, that was after he was genetically altered.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.614
I'm sorry, what?

31:05.407 --> 31:07.409
You want mckay to ask this thing to leave?

31:08.660 --> 31:10.537
We are talking about mckay.

31:10.579 --> 31:12.748
Scary things are not exactly his strength

31:12.789 --> 31:16.960
And he is up against a creature apparently capable of manipulating his subconscious.

31:17.252 --> 31:19.630
I wish there was a way for one of us to get in there.

31:20.881 --> 31:22.174
Into mckay's dreams?

31:22.216 --> 31:23.592
Yeah, you know,

31:23.675 --> 31:26.345
help him out, give him a little moral support.

31:26.512 --> 31:27.721
Come on

31:27.804 --> 31:33.727
all the things you've seen, you've never come across a way for one person to get into another person's dreams?

31:35.771 --> 31:37.064
Where's she going?

31:37.397 --> 31:38.607
What's going on?

31:38.815 --> 31:41.193
I don't know, but I think

31:41.652 --> 31:45.447
I'm about to see a side of mckay I never wanted to see.

31:45.614 --> 31:47.407
It does not have to be you.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.743
Yeah, well, it's my bad idea.

31:50.744 --> 31:52.246
What was?

31:53.413 --> 31:54.164
What...

31:54.581 --> 31:56.542
we first encountered the technology 10 years ago

31:56.542 --> 31:58.752
on a planet where the survivors of a holocaust

31:58.794 --> 32:01.880
were living entirely in a virtual world created in their minds.

32:02.214 --> 32:06.552
Since then, we've managed to modify it for use in the vr training of sg team members.

32:06.635 --> 32:10.305
It only took some minor calibrations to tune it in to subconscious activity.

32:11.056 --> 32:14.059
So sheppard is actually going to see mckay's dreams?

32:15.519 --> 32:19.022
Well, to be honest, the technology is untested for use in this manner.

32:19.356 --> 32:22.109
Dreams are much more random than conscious thought.

32:22.359 --> 32:25.821
It may be difficult for the system to translate what's going on in mckay's brain

32:25.821 --> 32:27.948
so that colonel sheppard can understand it.

32:28.282 --> 32:31.451
I'm just hoping that the two of them will be able to interact somehow.

32:39.209 --> 32:40.419
You sure about this?

32:41.461 --> 32:42.838
Not really.

32:43.922 --> 32:45.340
I'm pretty screwed up.

32:45.382 --> 32:46.925
You're telling me.

32:47.009 --> 32:48.969
We're ready if you are.

32:51.096 --> 32:52.222
Thanks.

32:52.723 --> 32:54.474
I haven't done anything yet

32:54.683 --> 32:55.726
For trying

32:55.767 --> 32:57.477
and don't say I didn't warn you.

32:58.729 --> 33:00.439
Administering sedative.

33:10.574 --> 33:12.159
Nothing's happening here.

33:12.326 --> 33:13.952
He's not dreaming yet.

33:43.065 --> 33:44.441
Oh, boy.

33:44.650 --> 33:45.734
Nice whale.

33:45.734 --> 33:47.319
Nice whale, you're my friend.

33:47.319 --> 33:49.196
You don't want to eat me.

33:49.238 --> 33:50.197
Give up.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.157
You'll never make it.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.660
You're too weak.

33:54.785 --> 33:57.162
Oh, thank you. Thanks for the encouragement. Way to help out.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.872
Why would I want to help you?

33:59.790 --> 34:00.791
Because I thought you--

34:00.791 --> 34:02.459
that's not me, rodney.

34:02.459 --> 34:03.377
Don't listen to him.

34:05.170 --> 34:06.588
You're pathetic.

34:06.713 --> 34:08.047
You might as well jump in.

34:10.634 --> 34:12.094
Don't be afraid.

34:13.344 --> 34:14.346
Oh, god,

34:14.554 --> 34:17.181
I have to get back. I have to get back. It's my only chance.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.060
You're going to die out here.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.103
Shut up!

34:21.143 --> 34:22.312
Don't listen to him, rodney.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.523
That's easy for you to say! Why don't you help me row?

34:30.070 --> 34:33.907
You know, this really isn't as strange as you lead me to believe.

34:33.949 --> 34:34.992
Oh, yeah?

34:34.992 --> 34:36.034
What about that?

34:39.621 --> 34:41.831
I hate clowns.

34:44.376 --> 34:46.295
You can paddle all you want.

34:46.753 --> 34:48.463
You're not going anywhere.

34:48.505 --> 34:50.507
He's right! I'm going to die out here!

34:50.716 --> 34:53.092
He wants you to be afraid. Don't give him what he wants!

34:53.260 --> 34:54.761
He can't really hurt you.

34:54.928 --> 34:57.097
That's where you're wrong.

35:05.856 --> 35:06.440
What happened?

35:06.440 --> 35:07.733
Clear.

35:11.195 --> 35:12.779
He's in cardiac arrest.

35:24.458 --> 35:25.834
I'm sorry.

35:25.959 --> 35:27.586
I've done all I can.

35:28.962 --> 35:30.547
He's dead.

36:02.663 --> 36:04.456
This is all your fault, john.

36:05.582 --> 36:08.544
If you hadn't touched that stupid rock, mckay would still be alive right now.

36:09.419 --> 36:11.213
I thought you were going to help him.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.131
I tried.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.384
Some friend you are.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.094
Colonel, you've been compromised.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.720
I'm relieving you of duty.

36:24.142 --> 36:25.811
Son of a bitch.

36:39.366 --> 36:40.701
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

36:40.784 --> 36:41.869
Just try to relax.

36:41.952 --> 36:42.828
What's going on?

36:42.870 --> 36:44.538
You were in cardiac arrest.

36:45.747 --> 36:46.665
The entity...

36:47.374 --> 36:49.001
it's in colonel sheppard.

37:02.431 --> 37:04.099
You can quit now.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.475
I'm not afraid of you.

37:05.475 --> 37:07.102
Oh, yes, you are.

37:07.644 --> 37:10.105
I'm the one thing you are afraid of.

37:10.355 --> 37:12.691
You failed your friends.

37:13.192 --> 37:14.568
You brought this on them

37:14.568 --> 37:18.113
and there is nothing you can do to stop it!

38:32.271 --> 38:34.523
His heart rate is dangerously high.

38:35.899 --> 38:37.359
Can you wake him up?

38:37.651 --> 38:40.195
I could try, but in his physical state, that could make things worse.

38:40.195 --> 38:42.072
Yes, and the entity would still be in him.

38:44.449 --> 38:46.034
Hook me up to him again.

39:22.738 --> 39:24.156
Get up.

39:25.616 --> 39:27.367
Come on, john.

39:27.659 --> 39:28.744
Fight!

39:29.077 --> 39:30.329
No.

39:30.746 --> 39:32.497
That's what you want.

39:32.581 --> 39:34.958
It's your fault heightmeyer's dead.

39:35.042 --> 39:37.252
Your fault mckay is dead!

39:37.961 --> 39:39.796
I'm not dead.

39:51.558 --> 39:53.477
You can't win.

39:53.644 --> 39:54.770
Yes, we can.

39:54.770 --> 39:57.356
You're vulnerable to electric shock. That's why I'm still alive.

39:57.439 --> 39:59.483
You left before you could finish the job!

40:03.195 --> 40:04.530
What the hell was that?

40:40.315 --> 40:41.942
Which one are you?

40:42.818 --> 40:44.069
Me.

40:44.570 --> 40:46.071
Good you or bad you?

40:46.113 --> 40:47.781
Me me.

40:48.615 --> 40:51.326
Is that... you you?

40:51.618 --> 40:53.161
I think so.

40:55.038 --> 40:56.540
Thanks.

40:57.916 --> 40:59.668
Okay, this is really weird.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.587
You're telling me.

41:03.338 --> 41:05.757
I thought there'd be more... hot girls

41:06.341 --> 41:07.593
Yeah

41:59.269 --> 42:00.354
Hey

42:00.437 --> 42:01.813
I have an idea.

42:01.813 --> 42:03.065
How about we get out of here?

42:04.149 --> 42:05.817
Sounds like a plan.

42:20.249 --> 42:21.333
Couldn't sleep.

42:21.458 --> 42:22.835
Yeah, me too.

42:27.130 --> 42:31.343
Thought I'd have a little snack before I... yeah, we couldn't sleep either.
