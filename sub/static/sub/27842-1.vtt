02:44.032 --> 02:45.599
Madam!

02:51.407 --> 02:53.243
Yah! Push!

03:13.031 --> 03:14.399
Hey.

03:16.066 --> 03:17.902
Come on!

04:58.209 --> 05:00.375
You must be tired.

05:00.377 --> 05:02.078
I am quite well.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.513
A supper has been prepared.

05:03.515 --> 05:06.549
We can have it brought up
to your chambers if you like.

05:06.551 --> 05:08.151
Yes. Thank you.

05:13.526 --> 05:15.158
How long are you staying?

05:15.160 --> 05:16.760
At Holyrood?

05:16.762 --> 05:19.162
In Scotland.

05:19.164 --> 05:21.532
Are you already planning
my departure?

05:21.534 --> 05:23.267
Of course not.

05:23.269 --> 05:26.272
We've long awaited your return.

05:28.441 --> 05:31.643
Kate will show you
to your chambers.

05:31.645 --> 05:33.247
This way, madam.

05:44.725 --> 05:46.726
Lord Bothwell,

05:46.728 --> 05:49.295
do you intend to stay as well?

05:49.297 --> 05:52.163
I swore an oath to the queen's
mother to protect her.

05:52.165 --> 05:53.600
Well, she is
well protected here.

05:53.602 --> 05:56.369
I'll uphold my oath,
just the same.

05:56.371 --> 06:00.206
And what reward
does your loyalty command?

06:00.208 --> 06:02.809
I'm driven by duty.
Not ambition.

06:12.454 --> 06:15.589
Madam, your cousin
has returned from France.

06:15.591 --> 06:18.860
Her protector is Lord Bothwell,
an able soldier.

06:18.862 --> 06:21.596
So, she comes ready for war.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.231
She may well depart
once married,

06:23.233 --> 06:24.867
but I cannot profess
to know her purpose.

06:24.869 --> 06:26.601
What says her brother?

06:26.603 --> 06:29.137
Moray is only
her half brother, madam.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.341
I believe his allegiance
is fully with us.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.642
What proof?

06:33.644 --> 06:36.411
He pledges to protect the
Protestant Church from Mary.

06:36.413 --> 06:38.480
And yet he has no power
to make such a pledge

06:38.482 --> 06:41.352
- if he is no longer regent.
- The nobles respect him.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.720
But can he control her?

06:44.722 --> 06:47.523
If she is anything
like our queen,

06:47.525 --> 06:50.226
then she does not yield
to a bridle.

06:50.228 --> 06:53.330
So says our Master of the Horse.

06:53.332 --> 06:56.001
By "bridal,"
do you speak of matrimony?

07:05.378 --> 07:06.711
You may tell Scotland

07:06.713 --> 07:09.881
that we wish to love
the Stuarts as our kin.

07:09.883 --> 07:12.685
But they must love us
in return.

07:16.924 --> 07:19.490
Madam, if I may speak?

07:19.492 --> 07:21.460
While she is on this island,

07:21.462 --> 07:23.595
she must bow to you,
not to Rome.

07:23.597 --> 07:25.664
Our Catholics must know
that a papist

07:25.666 --> 07:29.334
will never again sit
on the English throne.

07:29.336 --> 07:31.303
What would you suggest?

07:31.305 --> 07:33.673
Kill her hope,
and hopeless, she may return

07:33.675 --> 07:36.176
to the comfort
of the continent.

07:53.663 --> 07:55.431
Oh!

07:56.532 --> 07:58.666
Bravo, monsieur.

07:58.668 --> 08:01.301
Is your hand
as good as your French?

08:01.303 --> 08:03.673
My hand, madam?

08:09.546 --> 08:13.183
We are two sisters
bound by womanhood.

08:15.452 --> 08:18.286
Two princes on the same island.

08:18.288 --> 08:19.922
<i>Ruling side by side,</i>

08:19.924 --> 08:22.525
<i>we must do so in harmony.</i>

08:22.527 --> 08:23.793
<i>And not through a treaty</i>

08:23.795 --> 08:26.464
<i>drafted by men
lesser than ourselves.</i>

08:27.699 --> 08:31.801
<i>I wish us to make a treaty
of two queens.</i>

08:31.803 --> 08:33.703
<i>I would acknowledge
your rightful place</i>

08:33.706 --> 08:38.342
<i>on the English throne were you
to name me your successor.</i>

08:39.376 --> 08:41.645
<i>I hope we might meet in person,</i>

08:41.647 --> 08:43.816
<i>that I might embrace you...</i>

08:45.752 --> 08:48.418
<i>...and we might resolve
our destinies.</i>

08:48.420 --> 08:50.657
What do you see, Bess?

08:56.629 --> 08:58.431
Charming.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.803
Fair, if the painter
does not lie.

09:05.639 --> 09:07.340
Young.

09:08.877 --> 09:10.511
Clever.

09:11.946 --> 09:14.413
Confident.

09:14.415 --> 09:17.316
She would have no trouble
securing a husband,

09:17.318 --> 09:19.318
even without her throne.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.389
Nor would you, madam.

09:23.925 --> 09:25.827
Forgive me.

09:37.106 --> 09:40.473
<i>Elizabeth will not
accept my hand in marriage.</i>

09:40.475 --> 09:41.709
You cannot be certain.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.612
I know,
because I know her heart.

09:44.614 --> 09:47.448
The moment I betray it with
ambition, I lose her heart.

09:47.450 --> 09:49.684
Would you rather
she lose her crown?

09:49.686 --> 09:50.685
You exaggerate.

09:50.687 --> 09:53.622
How much blood has been spilled
in Rome's name?

09:53.624 --> 09:56.724
If a Catholic queen
bears a child before our own,

09:56.726 --> 09:59.795
have no doubt
blood will spill again.

09:59.797 --> 10:01.396
Muster your courage.

10:01.398 --> 10:03.032
Save us from her reticence.

10:03.034 --> 10:05.434
She will not produce a child
because her council

10:05.436 --> 10:07.504
<i>fears the Queen of Scots.</i>

10:10.642 --> 10:11.741
Aye.

10:11.743 --> 10:13.676
<i>Nor will she marry.</i>

10:13.678 --> 10:17.647
<i>She suspects all suitors
of wanting her throne.</i>

10:17.649 --> 10:19.082
- She will not have me.
- Nor would I

10:19.084 --> 10:22.853
have a commoner be king
were we not in need of an heir.

10:22.855 --> 10:25.923
I have her trust;
you have her affections.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.391
- You can succeed where I c...
- Good morning, William.

10:28.393 --> 10:29.495
Madam.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.133
Robert.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.135
Resplendent.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.003
Would you?

10:52.752 --> 10:55.154
That's William Maitland
of Lethington.

10:55.156 --> 10:57.458
Secretary of State.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.366
John Knox, Church of Scotland.

11:10.939 --> 11:12.873
Uh... loose string, ah?

11:18.181 --> 11:19.915
Let us begin.

12:01.559 --> 12:04.560
- Lord Lennox.
- My Lord.

12:04.562 --> 12:05.863
I would ask our mistress

12:05.865 --> 12:07.830
to beseech Queen Mary
that I be allowed

12:07.832 --> 12:10.633
- to return to Scotland so...
- This is not the place.

12:10.635 --> 12:12.903
It would be wise to have
a Catholic servant there.

12:12.905 --> 12:14.705
- My influence...
- It is your influence

12:14.707 --> 12:17.843
which emboldened papists here!

12:27.020 --> 12:28.688
You humiliate yourself, Father.

12:57.753 --> 13:00.588
But your queen is
in Scotland now.

13:06.962 --> 13:10.564
When my beloved FranÃ§ois
passed to God,

13:10.566 --> 13:13.870
I could have married
any number of suitors.

13:15.271 --> 13:18.808
Portugal, Denmark, Sweden.

13:19.709 --> 13:21.642
I declined them all.

13:21.644 --> 13:23.644
Just as I would not have

13:23.646 --> 13:27.216
a political marriage
imposed upon me...

13:27.218 --> 13:31.588
I will not impose an uncertain
fate upon my subjects.

13:35.159 --> 13:39.661
They remain free to worship
however they so choose,

13:39.663 --> 13:41.666
Catholic or Protestant.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.207
Pastor, you look displeased
with our tolerance.

13:50.209 --> 13:53.610
Any realm that is ruled by the
Pope is not tolerant, madam.

13:53.612 --> 13:55.146
It is enslaved.

13:55.148 --> 13:57.016
Stand when I address you.

14:00.685 --> 14:02.953
There is one true God,

14:02.955 --> 14:05.290
and therefore
one true religion.

14:05.292 --> 14:07.825
Such rhetoric incites revolt.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.794
If a prince strays
from God's will,

14:09.796 --> 14:13.365
it is not in doubt
that they may be resisted.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.733
And in your case...

14:15.735 --> 14:17.769
as with all women,

14:17.771 --> 14:22.040
their sight is but blindness,

14:22.042 --> 14:24.142
their strength weakness,

14:24.144 --> 14:27.146
her counsel foolishness,

14:27.148 --> 14:30.683
her judgment frenzy.

14:30.685 --> 14:33.920
Are we to abide
a papist and a woman both?

14:43.932 --> 14:47.733
Well, then I perceive that
my subjects shall obey you

14:47.735 --> 14:49.703
and not me.

14:49.705 --> 14:51.405
May I sit, madam?

14:51.407 --> 14:52.475
No.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.946
You may remove yourself
from this council and my court.

14:57.948 --> 15:02.085
My council is among
the faithful disciples I serve.

15:08.125 --> 15:12.229
We have as little need
of this court as it has of us.

15:16.267 --> 15:18.769
I pray for your soul, madam.

15:29.148 --> 15:32.215
I beg you to reconsider.
He has the trust of the people.

15:32.217 --> 15:34.784
Did I not give deference
to his faith?

15:34.786 --> 15:36.785
Yes, but...
we must be delicate.

15:36.787 --> 15:38.322
Allegiance does not happen
by proclamation.

15:38.324 --> 15:40.023
Where is his delicacy?

15:40.025 --> 15:42.493
That he should speak
to a monarch so?

15:42.495 --> 15:44.194
Would he challenge
Elizabeth thus?

15:44.196 --> 15:47.165
With what cause? He would
welcome a Protestant queen.

15:47.167 --> 15:50.468
Which is precisely why we must
not push him into her arms.

15:50.470 --> 15:52.671
Show him love.

15:53.806 --> 15:56.040
You are wise, brother.

15:56.042 --> 15:59.178
There are times for wisdom,
and there are times for love,

15:59.180 --> 16:02.082
but there are also times
for strength.

16:34.283 --> 16:36.252
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:38.522 --> 16:41.456
Your queen asks for approval,

16:41.458 --> 16:45.527
but how am I to grant her wish
when she offers no suitors?

16:45.529 --> 16:48.195
She would prefer
an English nobleman.

16:48.197 --> 16:49.331
And a Protestant.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.899
If it pleases Your Grace.

16:51.901 --> 16:55.470
As long as what pleases me
pleases Elizabeth.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.877
Perhaps I should wed you.

17:01.879 --> 17:03.812
Then I would have
my English nobleman.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.147
I do not think God wills it.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.384
If it be God's will
for Mary to marry,

17:08.386 --> 17:11.020
then Mary will marry,
and only who God intends

17:11.021 --> 17:13.025
for Mary to marry.

17:14.093 --> 17:16.092
I pray he wills
Elizabeth marry, too.

17:23.068 --> 17:24.601
No, no, no.

17:24.603 --> 17:25.969
No, no, no. Oh!

17:37.017 --> 17:39.150
You share good company.

17:39.152 --> 17:43.054
Maitland dotes
on Mistress Fleming.

17:43.056 --> 17:46.458
The only difference being
that he does not have a wife

17:46.460 --> 17:48.328
as you do.

17:59.373 --> 18:03.476
<i>We have a scourge
upon our land.</i>

18:03.478 --> 18:06.982
'Tis worse than pestilence
and famine.

18:07.948 --> 18:11.618
'Tis a woman with a crown.

18:11.620 --> 18:14.255
Who only pretends
to worship Christ,

18:14.257 --> 18:18.094
when in truth
she kneels before the Pope.

18:19.928 --> 18:23.397
We do not take instruction
from Rome.

18:23.399 --> 18:28.969
We resist those who would
tempt us with indulgences,

18:28.971 --> 18:32.540
deny those who worship luxury,

18:32.542 --> 18:36.445
respect not those
who flaunt their excesses

18:36.447 --> 18:40.349
and whore themselves to wealth
and the degradations

18:40.351 --> 18:42.052
<i>of the flesh.</i>

18:43.420 --> 18:45.190
No.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.379
Madame.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.515
Just be wary of these men.

19:11.517 --> 19:15.354
Their love is not the same
as their respect.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.299
Might I ask...

19:28.301 --> 19:31.970
since we've not
known it ourselves...

19:31.972 --> 19:34.038
what is it like?

19:34.040 --> 19:36.474
To have a man?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.310
Mm-hmm.

19:40.248 --> 19:42.316
I have only lain with FranÃ§ois.

19:43.284 --> 19:45.050
He shook terribly from fright.

19:45.052 --> 19:47.355
The poor boy did his best.

19:49.725 --> 19:52.057
But it was over
before it began.

19:52.059 --> 19:54.194
So y-you never...

19:54.196 --> 19:57.197
No. We tried but once.

19:57.199 --> 19:59.633
Beauty's fading flower

19:59.635 --> 20:03.036
Grows ever fresh with her in heavenly wise

20:03.038 --> 20:05.339
Suffice that Love
hath built his bower

20:05.341 --> 20:09.979
- Between my lady's lively shining eyes.
- Mm.

20:15.351 --> 20:17.619
I cannot, Robert.

20:17.621 --> 20:20.356
You know that.

20:25.229 --> 20:28.163
I should like to marry again,

20:28.165 --> 20:31.202
to know how it feels
to have a man fully.

20:35.105 --> 20:37.409
But not if I am owned.

20:42.314 --> 20:43.482
You're early.

21:07.406 --> 21:10.542
Mary will seek
a marriage that strengthens

21:10.544 --> 21:12.276
her claim to your throne

21:12.278 --> 21:15.015
and makes
her children Catholics.

21:17.752 --> 21:20.621
What sayest our ambassador?

21:21.823 --> 21:24.422
She feigns disinterest, madam,

21:24.424 --> 21:28.159
and informs me that the matter
of choice in marriage

21:28.161 --> 21:30.563
is perhaps a matter
best left to God.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.836
She is formidable, madam.

21:35.838 --> 21:40.573
We should marry her
to someone loyal to our queen,

21:40.575 --> 21:42.545
someone you control.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.785
Do not ask this of me.

21:50.787 --> 21:54.155
If you wed her, she is ours.

21:54.157 --> 21:55.623
And what of us?

21:55.625 --> 21:57.559
What "us"?

21:57.561 --> 21:59.761
You, Elizabeth...

21:59.763 --> 22:02.332
and I, your Robert.

22:04.367 --> 22:07.335
Marry the beautiful
Queen of Scots,

22:07.337 --> 22:10.074
and we can control her.

22:12.242 --> 22:14.143
With Mary,
you, too, become a prince.

22:14.145 --> 22:16.345
If I am noble enough
for one queen,

22:16.347 --> 22:19.517
I am noble enough for another.

22:20.886 --> 22:23.552
Elizabeth.

22:29.361 --> 22:31.697
England is not Scotland.

23:02.529 --> 23:05.197
<i>We would delight in holding</i>

23:05.199 --> 23:07.633
<i>our sister's hand in ours.</i>

23:07.635 --> 23:09.669
<i>Let us settle
on a meeting place</i>

23:09.671 --> 23:12.473
<i>before the summer
brings discomfort.</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:15.875
<i>Let our nations
cherish each other,</i>

23:15.877 --> 23:17.878
<i>as we would.</i>

23:19.381 --> 23:22.150
<i>Two kingdoms united.</i>

23:24.819 --> 23:26.654
<i>Meanwhile, accept this portrait</i>

23:26.656 --> 23:28.890
<i>as a sign of gratitude
for yours.</i>

23:28.892 --> 23:32.291
<i>And please accept this suitor,
who presents</i>

23:32.293 --> 23:34.395
<i>both his love and mine...</i>

23:34.397 --> 23:37.266
<i>the Earl of Leicester...</i>

23:38.434 --> 23:41.171
<i>...Lord Robert Dudley.</i>

23:46.543 --> 23:48.476
Do you think it might stand
with my honor

23:48.478 --> 23:50.781
to marry my sister's subject?

23:52.015 --> 23:55.450
It is true that an earl
is not a prince.

23:55.452 --> 23:57.353
Surely there can be
no greater honor

23:57.355 --> 23:59.622
than to match yourself
with a nobleman

23:59.624 --> 24:02.291
by whom you inherit
such a kingdom as England.

24:02.293 --> 24:04.560
I have such inheritance
by blood,

24:04.562 --> 24:06.997
regardless of who I marry
or do not marry.

24:06.999 --> 24:09.032
Hmm.

24:09.034 --> 24:12.334
We must discuss succession
before marriage,

24:12.336 --> 24:14.738
not the other way around.

24:14.740 --> 24:16.673
We hope we
do not vex thee, Earl.

24:16.675 --> 24:19.609
Not in the least, madam.
I appreciate your honesty.

24:19.611 --> 24:23.348
We see why our cousin
is so fond of the earl.

24:27.286 --> 24:29.021
I shall respect
Elizabeth's crown

24:29.023 --> 24:31.355
as soon as she names me
its successor.

24:31.357 --> 24:32.825
Uh, madam, my queen will not...

24:32.827 --> 24:34.692
If she has any concerns
about this proposal,

24:34.694 --> 24:37.496
she may express them
to me directly.

24:37.498 --> 24:39.764
Plans proceed for us to meet next month.

24:39.766 --> 24:41.767
Aye, madam, in York.

24:41.769 --> 24:44.738
We shall accomplish far more
without envoys between us.

24:48.776 --> 24:52.646
How like is it
unto your mistress' face?

25:24.948 --> 25:28.284
Halt! Halt!

25:39.429 --> 25:40.796
Why can't she meet me in York?

25:40.798 --> 25:42.665
Could her council
not wait till her return?

25:42.667 --> 25:44.432
Their business
was urgent, madam.

25:44.434 --> 25:45.968
The Huguenots sent an envoy.

25:45.970 --> 25:47.637
And she receives them?

25:47.639 --> 25:49.906
England wishes
no more bloodshed.

25:49.908 --> 25:53.444
Being from France yourself,
you must understand.

25:54.779 --> 25:57.948
You may tell my sister
that we pray for swift peace,

25:57.950 --> 25:59.783
that we may meet soon.

25:59.785 --> 26:01.418
I will tell her at once.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.821
Stay with us the night
at Holyrood.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.990
I'm certain Mistress Beaton
would welcome your company.

26:09.062 --> 26:10.796
Thank you, madam.

26:15.634 --> 26:17.669
She hides behind her council.

26:17.671 --> 26:19.170
You do not think she postpones?

26:19.172 --> 26:22.041
I don't think she intends
to meet until you recognize

26:22.043 --> 26:23.842
her legitimacy.

26:23.844 --> 26:25.476
A false promise, then.

26:25.478 --> 26:27.979
Retaliation, perhaps,
for refusing the treaty.

26:27.981 --> 26:29.615
For refusing Dudley.

26:29.617 --> 26:32.483
This is a matter of the heart,
not the state.

26:32.485 --> 26:34.520
They don't mix well.

26:34.522 --> 26:36.791
Wouldn't you say,
Mistress Fleming?

26:38.026 --> 26:39.758
I'm afraid I don't understand.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.895
Your mistress mocks
our affections.

26:41.897 --> 26:43.696
Not so.

26:43.698 --> 26:46.032
They sometimes have value.

27:09.793 --> 27:11.626
It's late.

27:11.628 --> 27:13.662
I must attend to my mistress.

27:13.664 --> 27:15.063
No.

27:15.065 --> 27:16.697
Don't attend. Don't attend.

27:16.699 --> 27:19.134
Think of your wife.

27:20.770 --> 27:22.804
Yeah.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.508
Nothing we spoke of.

27:26.510 --> 27:28.810
Of course not.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.096
The pox, madame.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.865
There is no envoy.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.100
She has the pox.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.038
How grave?

27:53.106 --> 27:54.907
Quite grave.

27:59.012 --> 28:01.913
Go rouse my brother.

28:01.915 --> 28:03.850
Dress me.

28:08.155 --> 28:09.690
Do you think me sinful?

28:17.131 --> 28:20.199
He has his plan.

28:20.201 --> 28:22.868
<i>It will please you to know
that I have warmed</i>

28:22.870 --> 28:25.638
to the prospect
of wedding Lord Dudley.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.875
We shall do so
upon one condition:

28:28.877 --> 28:31.144
<i>While we wish you
a long and healthy life</i>

28:31.146 --> 28:34.147
<i>and that no injury
or illness befall you,</i>

28:34.149 --> 28:36.950
we shall only do you the favor

28:36.952 --> 28:39.286
of betrothing
your special friend,

28:39.288 --> 28:41.824
Lord Robert Dudley...

28:43.625 --> 28:46.127
...once you name us heir.

28:55.972 --> 28:57.705
She knows.

28:57.707 --> 29:00.308
My "special friend."

29:00.310 --> 29:03.045
She wants him.
She wants him for her.

29:03.047 --> 29:05.180
My Robert.

29:05.182 --> 29:06.715
My crown!

29:06.717 --> 29:08.050
Quickly.

29:10.588 --> 29:12.956
Get out! Out! Out! Quickly out!

29:12.958 --> 29:15.058
Out, out! Out now!

29:15.060 --> 29:17.060
Out, out, out, out, out!

29:17.062 --> 29:19.229
- Out! Out!
- Out!

29:19.231 --> 29:20.230
Get out!

29:20.232 --> 29:21.332
- Robert.
- Out!

29:21.334 --> 29:23.632
Out, out! Get out!

29:23.634 --> 29:26.636
- Look away! Look away!
- Out! Out!

29:26.638 --> 29:28.605
Get out! Out!

29:28.607 --> 29:30.207
Look away! Out!

29:31.344 --> 29:33.611
Out! Out!

29:33.613 --> 29:35.148
Enough!

29:56.871 --> 29:58.972
I am yours.

30:01.708 --> 30:03.677
Forever yours.

30:09.984 --> 30:11.619
But how...

30:14.656 --> 30:18.726
...am I to refuse her
what I myself suggested?

30:31.241 --> 30:33.074
Oh...

30:36.712 --> 30:38.413
You look exquisite,
mademoiselle.

30:38.415 --> 30:43.017
Is it a sin that I feel more
a sister to you than a brother?

30:45.189 --> 30:47.423
Forgive me.

30:47.425 --> 30:50.128
I-I forget myself
in your company.

30:54.298 --> 30:56.633
Be whoever you wish with us.

30:57.436 --> 30:59.871
You make for a lovely sister.

31:07.212 --> 31:09.012
Oh...

31:11.984 --> 31:14.086
Enter.

31:20.192 --> 31:22.393
We have visi...

31:24.230 --> 31:26.199
We have visitors.

31:35.742 --> 31:38.212
They are Stuarts?

31:39.413 --> 31:41.747
I shall talk.
You say nothing.

31:41.749 --> 31:43.751
- What, not even to...
- Silence.

31:50.758 --> 31:52.861
The fourth Earl of Lennox.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.700
His son, Henry, Lord Darnley.

32:08.477 --> 32:11.245
Forgive me.

32:11.247 --> 32:13.847
I do not know
my queen's visage.

32:23.393 --> 32:25.729
Let me, Father.

32:41.346 --> 32:43.281
I give you verse.

32:48.887 --> 32:51.288
Unsheathing my quick wit

32:51.290 --> 32:54.191
to see who among you
it quickens.

32:54.193 --> 32:56.060
Hmm.

32:57.296 --> 32:58.962
But...

32:58.964 --> 33:02.132
should I fail
to choose correctly,

33:02.134 --> 33:05.138
'tis my soul
that shall be sickened.

33:09.242 --> 33:11.576
For shame.

33:11.578 --> 33:15.046
Returning to our native land,

33:15.048 --> 33:18.785
only to be deprived
of kissing...

33:20.420 --> 33:22.454
...my queen's...

33:22.456 --> 33:23.622
perfect...

33:28.162 --> 33:29.997
...hand.

33:47.249 --> 33:49.417
<i>Elizabeth was kind enough</i>

33:49.419 --> 33:51.151
<i>to grant us passage, so...</i>

33:51.153 --> 33:53.154
<i>here we're free to worship
as we choose.</i>

33:53.156 --> 33:55.189
<i>I doubt it's faith
that brings you.</i>

33:55.191 --> 33:57.491
<i>Rather the lands
your father seeks,</i>

33:57.493 --> 33:59.226
<i>or even the throne.</i>

33:59.228 --> 34:02.163
The throne?

34:02.165 --> 34:04.231
Why leave Elizabeth's court

34:04.233 --> 34:06.301
if not to regain
your influence here?

34:06.303 --> 34:09.204
And by laying suit to me,
does not the House of Lennox

34:09.206 --> 34:11.505
lay suit to all of Scotland?

34:14.945 --> 34:17.547
I amuse you?

34:17.549 --> 34:19.947
Yes.

34:19.949 --> 34:23.118
Madam, you must
not be Elizabeth.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.353
How so?

34:24.355 --> 34:26.188
Well, the woman lives
in fright.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.223
She's always
suspecting intrigue,

34:28.225 --> 34:32.061
- always fearing revolt.
- Her fears are wise.

34:32.063 --> 34:35.166
We both have nobles
who would have us deposed.

34:39.672 --> 34:41.974
Have I vexed you?

35:12.305 --> 35:15.976
You dare touch a sovereign
without her permission?

35:23.084 --> 35:26.986
I can speak for neither
my father nor Elizabeth,

35:26.988 --> 35:29.289
only for myself.

35:29.291 --> 35:31.091
And...

35:31.093 --> 35:33.461
speaking for myself...

35:33.463 --> 35:36.029
you have a loyal subject
in your Henry

35:36.031 --> 35:38.165
who would rather worship
at your feet

35:38.167 --> 35:40.467
than at a Catholic Mass.

35:54.718 --> 35:58.389
I shall just keep walking
with you until you object.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.200
You remain?

36:42.202 --> 36:45.305
The queen scarcely knows
Your Grace.

36:50.277 --> 36:52.777
But... I shall play

36:52.779 --> 36:55.048
and hear nothing.

37:33.858 --> 37:35.757
We cannot.

37:35.759 --> 37:37.125
We won't.

37:37.127 --> 37:39.127
This is not that.

37:39.129 --> 37:41.132
I promise.

37:42.833 --> 37:45.069
Have faith in me.

38:40.661 --> 38:43.163
Do you need to...?

38:43.898 --> 38:45.698
No.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.135
No, don't worry about me.

39:06.956 --> 39:11.892
Without a treaty signed, this
union strengthens her claim.

39:11.894 --> 39:14.696
You need not to condescend.
We are well informed!

39:14.698 --> 39:18.235
Forgive us. We merely seek
to protect your crown.

39:18.935 --> 39:20.870
You cannot wed him, madam.

39:20.872 --> 39:22.837
I do not wed him blindly.

39:22.839 --> 39:24.606
He has promised no ambition.

39:24.608 --> 39:26.776
He understands
he will only be your consort,

39:26.778 --> 39:31.246
a husband to a queen,
not a king in his own right?

39:31.248 --> 39:33.382
- He does.
- I find it difficult to believe

39:33.384 --> 39:35.951
that any man
would settle for as much.

39:35.953 --> 39:37.921
Two Catholics wed?

39:37.923 --> 39:39.455
Two Stuarts, madam?

39:39.457 --> 39:42.993
He has a claim of his own,
even without betrothal.

39:42.995 --> 39:44.794
Together, they make a union

39:44.796 --> 39:46.997
- of two claims.
- She has chosen an Englishman,

39:46.999 --> 39:48.866
as I asked.

39:48.868 --> 39:51.334
What recourse do I have?

39:51.336 --> 39:54.440
Implore her
to marry Lord Dudley.

40:00.947 --> 40:05.349
I will not offer my lord if it
means naming her successor.

40:05.351 --> 40:07.485
She will not accept him
otherwise.

40:07.487 --> 40:08.887
Then let her refuse him.

40:08.889 --> 40:10.822
On succession, I agree.

40:10.824 --> 40:12.590
But Darnley imperils us more.

40:12.592 --> 40:14.459
<i>Dudley is her puppet.</i>

40:14.461 --> 40:16.461
He offers no advantage.

40:16.463 --> 40:18.964
Unless she promises
to make you heir.

40:18.966 --> 40:20.431
Where is this promise?

40:20.433 --> 40:22.568
He would provoke revolt
amongst our nobles.

40:22.570 --> 40:24.570
Do you command
so little respect

40:24.572 --> 40:26.305
you could not discourage them?

40:26.307 --> 40:27.639
<i>We must not delay.</i>

40:27.641 --> 40:30.645
You must forbid this marriage.

40:36.051 --> 40:38.818
- Is that the top?
- Aye.

40:38.820 --> 40:41.654
And no subject
should ride before his queen.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.525
Would he?

41:17.061 --> 41:19.762
How it must feel,

41:19.764 --> 41:21.697
ruling all that you see.

41:21.699 --> 41:25.135
- I am but its servant.
- Ah.

41:27.438 --> 41:30.575
Are you prepared to be
its servant?

41:33.846 --> 41:36.714
It is right for the man
to ask, eh?

41:37.817 --> 41:39.983
Then ask.

41:39.985 --> 41:41.652
Uh...

41:41.654 --> 41:45.422
before God,
before all of Scotland,

41:45.424 --> 41:47.991
- before all the world...
- Yes?

41:47.993 --> 41:50.094
...you'll be my queen?

41:50.096 --> 41:51.428
Yes.

41:51.430 --> 41:53.065
And I your king?

41:53.067 --> 41:55.334
Yes.

41:56.102 --> 41:57.737
And your master?

41:58.805 --> 42:01.472
My husband.

42:20.195 --> 42:23.462
<i>England does not
consider Lord Darnley</i>

42:23.464 --> 42:24.630
<i>a suitable husband.</i>

42:24.632 --> 42:26.032
<i>He and his father</i>

42:26.034 --> 42:28.635
are English subjects, madam.

42:28.637 --> 42:31.838
If my queen orders
their return, they must.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.908
She asked that I marry
an English nobleman,

42:33.910 --> 42:35.109
and now she deprives me.

42:35.111 --> 42:38.679
Her wish is that you not marry
this particular nobleman.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.513
You may tell your mistress
I shall do so,

42:40.515 --> 42:41.515
with or without her blessing.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.985
Madam...

42:43.987 --> 42:46.188
before you act rashly,
please consider...

42:46.190 --> 42:49.825
It is enough my own lords treat
me as though I'm but a girl.

42:49.827 --> 42:52.995
I will not be treated
as such by Elizabeth.

42:52.997 --> 42:55.631
I will be the woman she is not.

42:55.633 --> 42:58.836
I shall produce an heir,
unlike her barren self.

43:07.078 --> 43:09.648
Prepare the ambassador's horse.

43:20.792 --> 43:24.527
Reckless child!
I have worked too long

43:24.529 --> 43:28.065
and too hard,
with too much bloodshed,

43:28.067 --> 43:30.935
to secure peace in our land!

43:30.937 --> 43:34.205
Do not let your
cursed passion rule you!

43:34.207 --> 43:36.607
'Tis your voice raised, sir.

43:36.609 --> 43:38.979
And you would lower it
in my presence.

43:42.015 --> 43:43.848
If my counsel

43:43.850 --> 43:46.152
no longer has value,
then I am obliged

43:46.154 --> 43:48.219
to withdraw from court.

43:48.221 --> 43:50.590
If you must.

44:19.722 --> 44:22.023
<i>You have neither
husband nor children,</i>

44:22.025 --> 44:26.728
and you approach an age
whereupon you cannot bear them.

44:26.730 --> 44:29.231
You must confront
the truth, madam,

44:29.233 --> 44:31.668
displeasing as it may be.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.673
I have confronted this truth.

44:40.211 --> 44:43.580
You understand that I cannot.

44:44.281 --> 44:45.883
Will not.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.353
And do I understand?

44:50.355 --> 44:53.123
No more than I understand God.

44:53.125 --> 44:55.891
It is my choice.

44:55.893 --> 44:59.195
God would have a woman
be a wife and a mother.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.232
So you defy his will?

45:01.234 --> 45:03.334
No.

45:03.336 --> 45:05.704
I choose to be a man.

45:07.373 --> 45:10.109
And marriage is dangerous.

45:11.344 --> 45:13.911
Such a man as I might marry,

45:13.913 --> 45:17.615
finding himself disappointed...

45:17.617 --> 45:19.083
He would conspire.

45:19.085 --> 45:22.120
No prince's revenues
be so great

45:22.122 --> 45:25.824
that they satisfy
the insatiable ambition of men.

45:25.826 --> 45:27.959
- This I understand.
- Which is why

45:27.961 --> 45:30.228
you are the closest thing
I shall ever have

45:30.230 --> 45:32.297
to a wife.

45:32.299 --> 45:35.769
I shan't mention your
proposal to Lord Dudley.

45:38.940 --> 45:41.408
This world is a brutal place.

45:41.410 --> 45:45.613
We men must be wiser,
mustn't we?

45:52.187 --> 45:54.123
Tell me what to do.

45:55.424 --> 45:57.991
We must make civil war
in Scotland.

45:57.993 --> 46:00.127
You would have me depose
a sister monarch?

46:00.129 --> 46:03.732
It is either civil war there
or civil war here.

46:06.735 --> 46:09.605
I want to know nothing of it.

46:10.840 --> 46:14.044
The arrangements
shall be mine alone.

46:37.369 --> 46:40.102
By the pleasure
and will of God,

46:40.104 --> 46:43.006
we proclaim complete
the bond of marriage

46:43.008 --> 46:47.177
between our sovereign,
Mary Queen of Scotland,

46:47.179 --> 46:51.449
and the noble Prince Henry,
Lord Darnley.

47:49.513 --> 47:52.847
<i>The authority of women,</i>

47:52.849 --> 47:54.316
<i>which I call not true authority</i>

47:54.318 --> 47:56.784
but carnal bondage,

47:56.786 --> 47:59.421
bringeth forth monsters.

47:59.423 --> 48:01.289
By their crimes,

48:01.291 --> 48:04.025
realms and nations
which used to live free

48:04.027 --> 48:08.965
are brought into bondage
against the will of God!

48:08.967 --> 48:13.102
Their cankered consciences
must be called to account.

48:13.104 --> 48:17.106
<i>We must take up arms
with our defender Lord Moray.</i>

48:17.108 --> 48:20.509
<i>We must make civil war
with this false queen!</i>

48:22.146 --> 48:25.015
<i>We must make plain war against</i>

48:25.017 --> 48:29.419
all false professors
of Christ's holy gospel!

48:57.851 --> 49:00.253
Oh.

49:03.591 --> 49:04.923
Oh.

49:04.925 --> 49:07.395
Ah. Ah. Ah. Oh, no.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.865
What will you do now?

49:13.201 --> 49:15.135
Bravo, Rizzio!

49:15.137 --> 49:17.470
Where do I sit?
Where do I sit?

49:17.472 --> 49:20.307
Where do... Ah.

49:42.599 --> 49:43.964
Rise and prepare yourself.

49:43.966 --> 49:45.969
Elizabeth has funded
a rebellion.

49:51.375 --> 49:53.244
He is in your care.

50:01.286 --> 50:03.854
Dress yourself.

50:10.396 --> 50:11.996
- Please! Please!
- Go!

50:14.065 --> 50:15.166
No! No!

50:20.306 --> 50:21.539
A word.

50:21.541 --> 50:23.407
Let him approach.

50:35.722 --> 50:39.023
That I betrayed you this way,

50:39.025 --> 50:41.995
I have no excuse.

50:44.030 --> 50:46.665
And I beg...

50:46.667 --> 50:49.103
- I beg that...
- Stand.

50:59.313 --> 51:02.317
You have not betrayed
your nature.

51:04.586 --> 51:06.253
I cannot fault you

51:06.255 --> 51:09.359
for succumbing
to his charms as I did.

51:11.226 --> 51:14.029
But we must be
more careful now.

51:39.490 --> 51:43.225
Moray is marching southwest,
towards Dumfries.

51:43.227 --> 51:44.493
The English can easily
supply them there.

51:44.495 --> 51:46.329
If we make good time,
we'll cut them off

51:46.331 --> 51:48.096
before they reach the gates.

51:48.098 --> 51:49.699
Why give chase?
Let them come to us.

51:49.701 --> 51:51.768
What would you have us do?

51:51.770 --> 51:53.571
If we lose sight,
they can flank us.

51:53.573 --> 51:55.104
I want to flank them first.

51:55.106 --> 51:57.541
There's a bridge they
must use to cross Annan.

51:57.543 --> 51:59.542
We can ambush them there.

51:59.544 --> 52:01.514
Give the order.

52:05.718 --> 52:07.117
Mary.

52:07.119 --> 52:09.053
I was speaking to you.

52:09.055 --> 52:11.555
Yes, I heard.

52:11.557 --> 52:13.792
Are you afraid, Henry?

52:13.794 --> 52:15.392
No.

52:15.394 --> 52:19.265
Good. Because our swords
are not just for show.

52:33.448 --> 52:34.847
Whence come you?

52:34.849 --> 52:36.515
The Highlands, madam.

52:36.517 --> 52:39.151
These two are from Inverness,
and I'm from Thurso.

52:39.153 --> 52:41.420
Catholic?

52:41.422 --> 52:44.190
- No, madam.
- And you?

52:44.192 --> 52:47.426
He doesn't know Scots,
madam, only Gaelic.

52:47.428 --> 52:50.631
Tell him I'm grateful
for his service.

52:56.137 --> 52:58.472
He says he's proud
to serve his queen,

52:58.474 --> 53:00.875
and to give his life
if he must.

53:00.877 --> 53:03.410
Tell him, if any of us
should die today,

53:03.412 --> 53:06.114
we all go to the same Heaven.

53:27.772 --> 53:30.707
Walk like men, not boys!

53:32.343 --> 53:34.209
March on! Good trail there!

53:34.211 --> 53:36.881
With your feet like that,
march on!

53:36.883 --> 53:38.582
No, you're too slow.

53:38.584 --> 53:40.384
This is too slow!

53:55.602 --> 53:57.501
Halt!

54:09.249 --> 54:12.185
Hyah! Hyah!

54:18.827 --> 54:21.129
Stand aside to let my men pass.

54:31.206 --> 54:33.574
I charge thee, give way.

54:33.576 --> 54:35.677
Drive them back.

54:52.795 --> 54:56.565
Form up! Form up!

55:13.018 --> 55:15.351
Man the guns!

55:15.353 --> 55:17.921
Man the guns! Stand and fight!

56:20.355 --> 56:21.724
Hyah! Hyah!

57:24.590 --> 57:27.593
- You summoned?
- How much have you had?

57:31.131 --> 57:33.901
I'm celebrating
our victory, my love.

57:44.544 --> 57:46.781
What are you doing?

57:53.055 --> 57:54.756
Mary...

57:56.757 --> 57:59.695
- Close your eyes.
- I...

58:10.505 --> 58:13.108
You're almost there.

58:13.110 --> 58:15.142
No, I can't.

58:15.144 --> 58:17.511
I can't.
I've had too much to drink.

58:17.513 --> 58:19.883
- Mar...
- Think of Rizzio.

58:37.135 --> 58:39.035
Yes, yes.

58:39.037 --> 58:41.170
That's it. That's it.

58:41.172 --> 58:43.572
Yeah? That's it.

58:51.750 --> 58:54.020
Huh?

59:48.743 --> 59:51.613
Pray for me.

01:00:22.046 --> 01:00:24.950
He'll make a fine stallion.

01:00:48.975 --> 01:00:51.108
If you have wondered

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:54.179
where your queen was
these past few months,

01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:56.013
now there are no secrets.

01:00:56.015 --> 01:00:59.384
The whisperings can end.

01:00:59.386 --> 01:01:02.087
Spring comes bearing fruit.

01:01:10.864 --> 01:01:13.966
My husband and I give thanks.

01:01:13.968 --> 01:01:16.135
With Heaven's blessing,
we bring another Stuart

01:01:16.137 --> 01:01:17.404
into this world,

01:01:17.406 --> 01:01:19.738
heir to Scotland

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.043
and to England.

01:01:24.112 --> 01:01:26.113
Heir to England?

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.947
She speaks for herself.

01:01:27.949 --> 01:01:30.050
Do her councillors fail
to advise her?

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:32.219
Oh, we advise her
endlessly, sir.

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:34.121
Not that she heeds it.

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.989
You must do better.

01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:38.158
Well, better than
your own queen's counsel?

01:01:42.798 --> 01:01:44.933
How did the world come to this?

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:47.302
Wise men servicing
the whims of women?

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:49.639
Aye.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:02.854
And that man's power dies with
the birth of his grandchild.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:07.156
It is a clear provocation.

01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:09.025
She knew well
Lord Randolph would report.

01:02:09.027 --> 01:02:11.026
And what would you have us do?

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:13.196
Go to war
over some reckless words?

01:02:13.198 --> 01:02:15.030
Not us. Her brother.

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:17.367
He hopes to raise
a second army.

01:02:17.369 --> 01:02:21.206
- If we were to assist him...
- As we did his first?

01:02:22.441 --> 01:02:24.707
I shall not fail you twice.

01:02:24.709 --> 01:02:27.411
Madam, we cannot let her name
your successor.

01:02:27.413 --> 01:02:29.147
She has no right.

01:02:29.149 --> 01:02:32.182
When I am dead and you are dead
and she is dead,

01:02:32.184 --> 01:02:37.021
it matters not what names
we did or did not say.

01:02:37.023 --> 01:02:39.790
The world will decide
for itself.

01:02:39.792 --> 01:02:42.163
Now is not the time to soften.

01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:49.036
It's a fine day, isn't it?

01:02:54.909 --> 01:02:57.045
I shall see you inside.

01:04:05.484 --> 01:04:07.319
James.

01:04:09.522 --> 01:04:11.421
Oh. Look.

01:04:11.423 --> 01:04:13.157
He likes it, too.

01:04:38.286 --> 01:04:39.618
So...

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.356
Mary's power grows
with her pregnancy.

01:04:43.591 --> 01:04:46.194
Your letter said
you had a proposal.

01:04:48.362 --> 01:04:52.465
Once Mary bears a child...

01:04:52.467 --> 01:04:55.602
Darnley will never be king.

01:04:55.604 --> 01:04:58.138
There is no need for your son.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:02.209
An infant cannot
grant you pardon.

01:05:02.211 --> 01:05:06.946
It is right that you
should return from exile.

01:05:06.948 --> 01:05:09.618
And it is right
my son should be king,

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.619
<i>and we can rule through him</i>

01:05:11.621 --> 01:05:14.123
<i>if we weaken Mary's power.</i>

01:05:15.992 --> 01:05:18.059
Mary, we must speak.

01:05:18.061 --> 01:05:19.594
Can you open the door?

01:05:19.596 --> 01:05:21.229
- Mary?
- Let him in.

01:05:21.231 --> 01:05:24.233
Open the door so we can speak!

01:05:28.539 --> 01:05:29.971
Mary?

01:05:34.412 --> 01:05:35.412
Mary, open the...

01:05:41.554 --> 01:05:43.553
What are you doing here?

01:05:43.555 --> 01:05:45.291
Come, Henry.

01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:57.201
You would have David here
and bar your own husband?

01:05:57.203 --> 01:06:00.037
When I am anointed king,

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.407
you will afford me
the respect of a wife.

01:06:02.409 --> 01:06:05.078
After all,
that is what you promised.

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:25.197
Would you have his father
be nothing but a consort?

01:06:25.199 --> 01:06:26.699
We know not if it's a he.

01:06:26.701 --> 01:06:29.168
I am more than a sire
to a mare, Mary.

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.038
Please, I am tired.

01:06:32.707 --> 01:06:35.343
Do you love me?

01:06:40.047 --> 01:06:42.151
Do you love me?

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.090
You've given me an heir
to two thrones.

01:06:49.992 --> 01:06:53.096
That matters more than love.

01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:10.212
The queen is servant of Satan.

01:07:10.214 --> 01:07:12.614
She is a fornicator

01:07:12.616 --> 01:07:14.450
with a monstrous lust.

01:07:14.452 --> 01:07:18.253
This pleasuring woman
is not fit to rule us.

01:07:18.255 --> 01:07:21.024
Would we kneel before a polecat

01:07:21.026 --> 01:07:23.626
who has bedded an Italian?

01:07:23.628 --> 01:07:25.361
David Rizzio.

01:07:25.363 --> 01:07:30.166
A Catholic who never leaves
her bed chamber!

01:07:30.168 --> 01:07:34.472
How do we know her child
is not a bastard?

01:07:34.474 --> 01:07:36.473
<i>David Rizzio.</i>

01:07:36.475 --> 01:07:40.644
He is an impediment
to your rightful place as king.

01:07:40.646 --> 01:07:42.713
Enough.

01:07:42.715 --> 01:07:45.550
We speak of Rizzio's
relations with your wife.

01:07:45.552 --> 01:07:47.117
With Mary?

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:48.652
You're mistaken.

01:07:48.654 --> 01:07:51.121
Does he not spend
more time with the queen

01:07:51.123 --> 01:07:52.389
than Your Grace?

01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:54.392
Why else would she make
a common minstrel

01:07:54.394 --> 01:07:56.761
- her private secretary?
- No, it cannot be.

01:07:56.763 --> 01:07:58.430
And what matter if it be true?

01:07:58.432 --> 01:08:01.166
- Because I'm not a cuckold.
- Would you rather

01:08:01.168 --> 01:08:02.667
the honest truth be told?

01:08:02.669 --> 01:08:04.304
That you are a sodomite?

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.509
We must erase your sins.

01:08:09.511 --> 01:08:13.348
And either you are
the adulterer, or it is she.

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:23.091
The other lords have signed.

01:08:46.182 --> 01:08:48.585
Aha!

01:08:51.587 --> 01:08:54.591
Ah! You have been saving that.

01:09:14.212 --> 01:09:16.211
You! Come with me, sir!

01:09:16.212 --> 01:09:19.749
You dare charge
into my chamber unannounced?

01:09:19.751 --> 01:09:21.652
- David Rizzio!
- David.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:23.286
I am with child!

01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:25.656
- No! No!
- Take her.

01:09:25.658 --> 01:09:28.894
All that is done
is in Lord Darnley's name.

01:09:28.895 --> 01:09:31.362
- Henry.
- Let go! No!

01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:33.430
Get off!

01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:35.899
- What have you done?
- It is done.

01:09:35.902 --> 01:09:37.736
Look at me. Look at me.

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:40.638
It is done, Mary. Do not interfere.

01:09:42.376 --> 01:09:45.112
No! No!

01:09:50.885 --> 01:09:52.952
Adulterer!

01:09:54.889 --> 01:09:56.957
No!

01:10:00.427 --> 01:10:03.498
- Enough!
- No! No!

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.936
Stand aside.

01:10:11.539 --> 01:10:12.772
No.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:20.246
Come on, Mary!

01:10:20.248 --> 01:10:21.883
Please...

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:22.984
Don't.

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:25.253
Please, no. Please don't.

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:26.554
Please don't. Please don't.

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:31.493
- William!
- Do not interfere.

01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:34.197
No!
- No!

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:38.335
No!

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:41.504
No!

01:11:02.861 --> 01:11:06.329
You must make the final blow.

01:11:06.331 --> 01:11:08.031
I can't.

01:11:08.033 --> 01:11:10.269
Go on.

01:11:11.737 --> 01:11:15.472
No. No.

01:11:15.474 --> 01:11:16.575
No.

01:11:21.314 --> 01:11:23.781
Adulterer!

01:12:48.807 --> 01:12:51.408
He beguiled us, Mary.

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:53.546
Both of us.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.883
He brought us dishonor.

01:12:58.985 --> 01:13:01.354
Did he not?

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.392
You are trying to usurp
my crown.

01:13:07.394 --> 01:13:09.627
Have I not brought you a child?

01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:12.666
One minute makes not a man.

01:13:13.601 --> 01:13:15.733
Beg forgiveness...

01:13:15.735 --> 01:13:17.536
for your insult.

01:13:17.538 --> 01:13:19.437
- Beg forgiveness now.
- I shall not.

01:13:19.439 --> 01:13:21.475
Bothwell has escaped.

01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:28.949
This is your fault.

01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:30.884
All of this, this chaos.

01:13:30.886 --> 01:13:32.886
It's your fault.

01:13:32.888 --> 01:13:34.654
You swore obedience
to me, Mary,

01:13:34.656 --> 01:13:36.555
on the day of our marriage.

01:13:36.557 --> 01:13:38.859
You swore obedience to me!

01:13:38.861 --> 01:13:40.828
I am king!

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.729
You are a traitor.

01:13:42.731 --> 01:13:44.431
As are you.

01:13:44.433 --> 01:13:46.667
And until I am killed,
and forever after,

01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:48.702
God will see you as such.

01:13:48.704 --> 01:13:51.138
You will not be killed, madam.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.474
Let us go.
We have much business.

01:13:53.476 --> 01:13:55.910
Lord Moray will arrive soon.

01:13:55.912 --> 01:13:57.645
My brother conspired?

01:13:57.647 --> 01:14:01.452
Your brother returns
to assist your husband.

01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:11.428
I want a drink.

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:21.571
Am I to be
imprisoned here alone,

01:14:21.573 --> 01:14:24.040
or may I have the company
of my gentlewomen?

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:26.743
You may not, madam.

01:14:26.745 --> 01:14:29.046
You are to remain
in this chamber.

01:14:31.483 --> 01:14:34.652
Then at least
let my husband remain.

01:14:34.654 --> 01:14:37.554
Or would you have
a drunkard for a king?

01:15:04.551 --> 01:15:06.454
Come, Henry.

01:15:09.258 --> 01:15:11.626
I do not feel well.

01:15:34.718 --> 01:15:37.286
They forced me
into the room, Mary.

01:15:37.288 --> 01:15:39.488
I swear.

01:15:40.689 --> 01:15:42.890
And I didn't know that...

01:15:42.892 --> 01:15:45.227
Not until they arrived.
I promise.

01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:48.964
Maitland is very persuasive.

01:15:48.966 --> 01:15:50.799
Yes.

01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:53.802
My brother even more so.

01:15:53.804 --> 01:15:54.737
Hmm.

01:15:54.739 --> 01:15:58.576
They will take your crown
as well as mine.

01:16:04.782 --> 01:16:07.052
We should leave here.

01:16:08.353 --> 01:16:10.787
It's best.

01:16:10.789 --> 01:16:13.224
For all three of us.

01:16:13.226 --> 01:16:14.893
Yes.

01:16:19.198 --> 01:16:21.332
It is important
that the people do not accuse

01:16:21.334 --> 01:16:23.200
those who participated
as traitors.

01:16:23.202 --> 01:16:25.337
They must be pardoned
so there's no doubt

01:16:25.339 --> 01:16:27.071
of their loyalty to the crown.

01:16:27.073 --> 01:16:31.376
When she pardons
all involved, you may go.

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:34.146
Am I to be told
what I may and may not do?

01:16:34.148 --> 01:16:36.948
And by who? Hmm?

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:41.087
A mere lord
and a bastard half brother?

01:16:41.089 --> 01:16:44.022
Am I not the king
to whom you promised fealty

01:16:44.024 --> 01:16:46.094
before you carried out
your violence?

01:16:49.864 --> 01:16:51.830
Let me remind you
that this king shall go

01:16:51.832 --> 01:16:55.103
where he pleases with his wife
when it pleases him.

01:17:11.287 --> 01:17:13.123
The Queen.

01:17:19.028 --> 01:17:20.862
What is this?

01:17:20.864 --> 01:17:22.797
The queen's army.

01:17:22.799 --> 01:17:25.001
Your chambers are ready.

01:17:26.303 --> 01:17:29.606
Do not make them use force.

01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:41.183
<i>They have at least 500.</i>

01:17:41.185 --> 01:17:43.752
More are on the way.

01:17:43.754 --> 01:17:45.288
Then we shall raise
our own army.

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:47.289
There is no appetite for war.

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:50.062
Then let us stir an appetite.

01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:53.296
When last we raised an army,

01:17:53.298 --> 01:17:57.368
it was but half the size
of hers with England's help.

01:17:57.370 --> 01:18:00.839
Without England,
we will be crushed.

01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:05.111
She has outmaneuvered us.

01:18:19.058 --> 01:18:21.860
My husband claims
he knew nothing of your plot

01:18:21.862 --> 01:18:24.097
- until the day itself.
- That's not true.

01:18:25.366 --> 01:18:28.202
He signed a bond
with his own hand.

01:18:30.938 --> 01:18:33.772
If you wish it destroyed,
however...

01:18:33.774 --> 01:18:35.776
Not destroyed.

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:40.112
We shall sign this pardon

01:18:40.114 --> 01:18:42.984
as soon as you produce
the bond.

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:49.958
Aye, madam.

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:08.242
The flowers are all
of one color.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.878
Poppies are red.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.513
I know of no other color
that...

01:19:11.515 --> 01:19:15.550
In the light, they are
many colors... red and others.

01:19:15.552 --> 01:19:17.320
Nature is more subtle.

01:19:17.322 --> 01:19:19.022
The council is met.

01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:22.960
There is news from Scotland.

01:19:25.263 --> 01:19:27.230
What do you think?

01:19:27.232 --> 01:19:29.899
Lovely.

01:19:29.901 --> 01:19:32.335
The flowers not too plain?

01:19:32.337 --> 01:19:34.306
The news is urgent.

01:19:36.274 --> 01:19:39.543
What news do I want
from Scotland?

01:19:39.545 --> 01:19:41.945
Bloodshed?

01:19:41.947 --> 01:19:44.814
Go conspire among yourselves.

01:19:44.816 --> 01:19:46.919
Very well.

01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:58.997
Burn it.

01:19:58.999 --> 01:20:01.302
I shall begin again.

01:20:03.570 --> 01:20:05.772
Burn it, I say!

01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:25.892
You visited Mother and me here

01:20:25.894 --> 01:20:28.060
before we left for France.
You remember?

01:20:28.062 --> 01:20:30.597
Yes.
Those were tumultuous times.

01:20:30.599 --> 01:20:33.601
It was here in this glen
you lifted me high

01:20:33.603 --> 01:20:36.271
when I said I wished
to be a bird.

01:20:37.473 --> 01:20:39.172
If you say so.

01:20:39.174 --> 01:20:41.008
I understand why you
wouldn't remember

01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:42.476
a trifling thing like that.

01:20:42.478 --> 01:20:45.346
Of what consequence are
the fancies of a little girl?

01:20:45.348 --> 01:20:48.817
Not all little girls
are born to be queens.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:59.960
I should like you
to hold my child up one day.

01:20:59.962 --> 01:21:02.866
Make him fly as you made me.

01:21:07.137 --> 01:21:09.971
He will be born a prince,

01:21:09.973 --> 01:21:12.276
and one day, king.

01:21:13.211 --> 01:21:15.278
I want him to love his uncle

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.380
and to be born
into a peaceful land.

01:21:17.382 --> 01:21:19.682
- I wish the same.
- Then will you love your sister

01:21:19.684 --> 01:21:21.253
as you would love her child?

01:21:22.621 --> 01:21:25.456
For she still loves you.

01:21:25.458 --> 01:21:28.625
And if it is a son,
she will call him James,

01:21:28.627 --> 01:21:31.330
for both his grandfather
and his uncle.

01:21:34.033 --> 01:21:36.467
I do not deserve your kind...

01:21:36.469 --> 01:21:39.004
- James.
- ...your kindness.

01:22:03.698 --> 01:22:07.233
<i>My dearest cousin Elizabeth,</i>

01:22:07.235 --> 01:22:08.334
<i>we have had our differences,</i>

01:22:08.336 --> 01:22:11.337
<i>and what sorrow
it has brought my heart.</i>

01:22:11.339 --> 01:22:14.441
<i>But before I bring a child
into this world,</i>

01:22:14.443 --> 01:22:16.175
<i>I wish to reconcile.</i>

01:22:16.177 --> 01:22:19.979
<i>I would our child
have two mothers.</i>

01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:22.284
"A mother who bears him...

01:22:23.352 --> 01:22:26.119
"...and you,
his chosen godmother.

01:22:26.121 --> 01:22:29.092
No child would be
more blessed."

01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:27.117
<i>I am told the labor was long.</i>

01:23:27.119 --> 01:23:30.355
<i>But only with suffering
do we know joy.</i>

01:23:31.692 --> 01:23:36.795
<i>What greater joy than to have
a son to call your own.</i>

01:23:36.797 --> 01:23:41.601
<i>Humbly do I accept your
invitation to be his godmother,</i>

01:23:41.603 --> 01:23:44.605
<i>as I might share
in your happiness.</i>

01:23:46.508 --> 01:23:49.542
<i>What is more, we should return
to the issue of inheritance,</i>

01:23:49.544 --> 01:23:52.812
<i>now that a new generation
is upon us.</i>

01:23:52.814 --> 01:23:55.548
<i>Your terms are most agreeable.</i>

01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:59.853
<i>It is only right that your heir
succeed you if you marry</i>

01:23:59.855 --> 01:24:02.456
<i>and bear children of your own.</i>

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:11.298
<i>And should you not,
it is my son's great honor</i>

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.535
<i>to rule
by your sublime example.</i>

01:24:26.817 --> 01:24:28.449
If you grant her succession,

01:24:28.451 --> 01:24:30.252
we are rewarding
her disobedience.

01:24:30.254 --> 01:24:31.854
What disobedience?

01:24:31.856 --> 01:24:34.456
She is not our subject.

01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:37.395
And yet you would make us hers.

01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:41.464
What have you produced

01:24:41.466 --> 01:24:44.733
in all your travels
between our kingdoms?

01:24:44.735 --> 01:24:46.336
Discord?

01:24:46.338 --> 01:24:47.436
War?

01:24:47.438 --> 01:24:48.571
Death?

01:24:48.573 --> 01:24:52.341
And now you have the boldness
to doubt my judgment?

01:24:52.343 --> 01:24:55.412
You had better question yours.

01:24:55.414 --> 01:24:58.516
I regret that you
perceive me as a failure.

01:24:58.518 --> 01:25:01.352
We serve you fully,

01:25:01.354 --> 01:25:03.654
with all our hearts.

01:25:03.656 --> 01:25:05.823
Any one of us
would gladly die for you,

01:25:05.825 --> 01:25:08.860
but Mary is our foe
and a Catholic.

01:25:08.862 --> 01:25:12.263
She is only your queen if
I should not produce an heir.

01:25:12.265 --> 01:25:14.332
And will you, madam?

01:25:14.334 --> 01:25:18.503
For you have given us
little hope so far.

01:25:18.505 --> 01:25:22.608
Despite your every effort,
she has prevailed.

01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:23.742
She has proven herself,

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:27.713
in fact, far more capable
than my own privy council!

01:25:27.715 --> 01:25:29.682
Should I die before my time,

01:25:29.684 --> 01:25:33.521
we could do worse than to place
her on the throne of England.

01:25:36.926 --> 01:25:39.661
Is this not your name?

01:25:42.397 --> 01:25:44.797
- It's forged.
- Henry...

01:25:44.799 --> 01:25:47.968
- I swear, this is an outrage.
- It's your hand.

01:25:50.272 --> 01:25:52.675
You must believe me.

01:25:58.715 --> 01:26:01.418
Am I not to see my own son?

01:26:02.819 --> 01:26:04.887
I'm not to see him?

01:26:04.889 --> 01:26:07.288
He's not to know his father?

01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:08.657
For your child's sake,

01:26:08.659 --> 01:26:11.662
be contented
with a pardon and your life.

01:26:12.964 --> 01:26:15.397
We have procured
a house for you.

01:26:15.399 --> 01:26:17.433
We are to live apart.

01:26:17.435 --> 01:26:19.570
Bothwell will see you there.

01:27:01.882 --> 01:27:04.718
You're moving.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:12.358
Oh.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:16.061
- You must divorce him, madam.
- It is forbidden.

01:27:16.063 --> 01:27:17.564
Not in the Church of Scotland.

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:19.565
He is the father of my child.

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.601
I will not do him
such an indignity.

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:23.570
- Darnley is cursed.
- He is harmless.

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:24.905
Not so.

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:26.740
He's still plotting
to take your crown.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:30.445
My men heard him.
He spoke of regicide.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.949
You have commanded armies
against armies.

01:27:34.951 --> 01:27:36.884
Now you fear a single man?

01:27:36.886 --> 01:27:40.453
- I did not claim to fear him.
- Then why advocate divorce?

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:42.790
My oath is to defend
your safety.

01:27:42.792 --> 01:27:44.360
So you do fear him.

01:27:51.334 --> 01:27:52.935
Just as you vowed
to protect me,

01:27:52.937 --> 01:27:54.569
I vowed loyalty to my husband.

01:27:54.571 --> 01:27:58.340
Any man who marries me
will try to make himself king.

01:27:58.342 --> 01:28:00.408
I owe him
neither comfort nor title,

01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:02.544
but I will not become
a lady Henry VIII,

01:28:02.546 --> 01:28:05.416
dispensing with husbands
as he did wives.

01:28:15.894 --> 01:28:18.962
Ow. Damn.

01:28:18.964 --> 01:28:20.632
Ow.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.566
<i>My lord,</i>

01:28:23.568 --> 01:28:26.670
you argued well in council.

01:28:26.672 --> 01:28:29.506
May we borrow your wisdom
for a moment?

01:28:29.508 --> 01:28:33.480
The queen should not cast aside
your protection.

01:29:48.726 --> 01:29:50.828
Mommy!

01:29:52.463 --> 01:29:54.463
It's Lord Darnley.

01:29:54.465 --> 01:29:56.667
Attempt on his life.

01:29:57.836 --> 01:30:00.604
Is he dead?

01:30:13.786 --> 01:30:16.086
I'll take you to my estate.

01:30:16.088 --> 01:30:18.589
It's not safe for you here.

01:30:18.591 --> 01:30:20.624
James should stay
with one of your ladies

01:30:20.626 --> 01:30:22.963
for his safety.

01:30:37.578 --> 01:30:40.846
It's okay.

01:30:40.848 --> 01:30:43.548
As soon as the women
are loaded, get us moved.

01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:46.953
Come on!

01:30:46.955 --> 01:30:49.189
- It's okay.
- Madam.

01:30:49.191 --> 01:30:51.590
Madam, we have to go.

01:30:51.592 --> 01:30:54.261
Mama! Mama!

01:30:57.833 --> 01:31:00.937
Mama! Mama!

01:31:04.006 --> 01:31:06.907
Mama! Mama!

01:31:06.909 --> 01:31:08.010
Mama!

01:31:09.112 --> 01:31:10.612
Mama!

01:31:11.613 --> 01:31:14.484
Mama! Mama...

01:31:50.356 --> 01:31:51.823
Pardon.

01:31:52.925 --> 01:31:54.693
No need.

01:31:56.628 --> 01:31:59.132
May we speak in private?

01:32:21.389 --> 01:32:23.690
What brings you?

01:32:25.794 --> 01:32:27.959
Parliament will ratify
a proclamation

01:32:27.961 --> 01:32:30.630
demanding you wed
a Scottish subject,

01:32:30.632 --> 01:32:32.165
now that you're widowed.

01:32:32.167 --> 01:32:34.102
It has only been a day.

01:32:35.203 --> 01:32:37.037
They meet tomorrow.

01:32:37.039 --> 01:32:40.041
It's your council's advice
that you should marry me.

01:32:52.088 --> 01:32:54.124
What have you done?

01:33:03.266 --> 01:33:05.136
Murderer.

01:33:08.071 --> 01:33:10.672
Did I not come to your aid
when your lords rebelled?

01:33:10.674 --> 01:33:12.240
Did I not? I was loyal!

01:33:12.242 --> 01:33:13.811
Me!

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.814
Refuse, and I will not come
to your aid

01:33:18.816 --> 01:33:20.349
when they rebel again.

01:33:20.351 --> 01:33:22.887
Please...

01:33:35.367 --> 01:33:36.970
Come.

01:33:41.407 --> 01:33:43.441
Undress your lady.

01:33:43.443 --> 01:33:46.779
She has consented
to be my wife.

01:34:43.806 --> 01:34:45.807
<i>A whore of Babylon</i>

01:34:45.809 --> 01:34:48.510
<i>who defies the sanctity
of marriage.</i>

01:34:48.512 --> 01:34:50.378
<i>What's worse,</i>

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.848
she has broken
the most solemn commandment:

01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:57.486
Thou shalt not kill.

01:34:57.488 --> 01:35:00.121
She had her husband murdered

01:35:00.123 --> 01:35:03.159
so that she could wed
his rival.

01:35:03.161 --> 01:35:06.829
Would we worship
a murderous harlot?

01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:11.033
Queen Strumpet marries
another man

01:35:11.035 --> 01:35:13.570
whom she bedded out of wedlock.

01:35:13.572 --> 01:35:17.374
Our kingdom has become
a disgrace,

01:35:17.376 --> 01:35:20.177
to God and all the world!

01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:26.083
Death to the whore!

01:35:26.085 --> 01:35:28.518
Death to the whore!
Death to the whore!

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.988
Death to the whore!

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.989
Death to the whore!
Death to the whore!

01:35:31.991 --> 01:35:33.258
Death to the whore!

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.560
Death to the whore!
Death to the whore!

01:35:35.562 --> 01:35:37.028
Death to the whore!

01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:39.297
Death to the whore!
Death to the whore!

01:35:39.299 --> 01:35:41.400
Death to the whore!
Death to the whore...

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:52.244
You promised I would be king.

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:55.247
If your betrothed
does abdicate,

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:57.550
you are abdicated also.

01:35:57.552 --> 01:35:59.084
This was your intention.

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.187
Events have overtaken
all intentions.

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:02.389
Liar!

01:36:02.391 --> 01:36:03.759
Liars.

01:36:04.626 --> 01:36:06.926
Events? Aye.

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:09.798
Events by your design,
is that not true?

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.134
Speak, damn you.

01:36:13.136 --> 01:36:15.869
Be men and own your treachery.

01:36:15.871 --> 01:36:17.405
Did you not deceive me?

01:36:17.407 --> 01:36:22.343
As they have done their queen
since the day she returned.

01:36:22.345 --> 01:36:25.012
Were you fool enough
to trust these men?

01:36:25.014 --> 01:36:27.850
Who took up arms against you?

01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:31.152
You must abdicate, madam.

01:36:31.154 --> 01:36:33.955
When your son comes of age,
he'll assume the throne.

01:36:33.957 --> 01:36:36.157
Until then,
my lord will be regent.

01:36:36.159 --> 01:36:38.160
- Brother.
- We found Mistress Seton.

01:36:38.162 --> 01:36:41.963
The boy is now
in our custody at Holyrood.

01:36:41.965 --> 01:36:44.032
You hold my son prisoner?

01:36:44.034 --> 01:36:46.336
Not prisoner.

01:36:46.338 --> 01:36:49.372
He-he's my ward
until he is old enough...

01:36:49.374 --> 01:36:51.274
Your namesake, James.

01:36:51.276 --> 01:36:53.644
Named for you.

01:36:53.646 --> 01:36:56.512
If you wish him
to be king one day,

01:36:56.514 --> 01:36:58.382
you must abdicate.

01:36:58.384 --> 01:37:00.951
- I will not do it.
- You will, madam.

01:37:00.953 --> 01:37:02.219
By force, if we must.

01:37:02.221 --> 01:37:04.488
I shall meet force with force.

01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:08.091
People believe you are
a traitor and a whore.

01:37:08.093 --> 01:37:09.494
What army can defeat

01:37:09.496 --> 01:37:12.162
an entire nation
turned against its queen?

01:37:12.164 --> 01:37:14.466
They would sooner parade
your head on a pike

01:37:14.468 --> 01:37:16.533
than bow before a harlot.

01:37:16.535 --> 01:37:20.003
I for one would gladly
hold high that pike.

01:37:24.177 --> 01:37:26.144
Well, he is right.
You cannot raise an army.

01:37:26.146 --> 01:37:30.150
Many times you have said
I cannot do what I have done.

01:37:32.152 --> 01:37:35.156
Then we are finished here.

01:37:43.398 --> 01:37:44.697
This is beyond my control.

01:37:44.699 --> 01:37:46.165
I ask you to reconsider.

01:37:46.167 --> 01:37:49.169
All I have done is try
to unify this land.

01:37:49.171 --> 01:37:51.138
I know.

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:53.708
To relinquish the crown
would be against God's will.

01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:55.642
Oh, God will not protect you.

01:37:55.644 --> 01:37:59.047
I will protect you, as my kin.

01:38:00.616 --> 01:38:03.083
I wish that we were kin.

01:38:03.085 --> 01:38:05.355
But we are no longer so.

01:39:01.815 --> 01:39:04.116
I would.

01:39:20.667 --> 01:39:24.338
Are we to do nothing
as my sister is deposed?

01:39:26.708 --> 01:39:29.143
She's not your sister.

01:39:30.813 --> 01:39:33.382
Nor can she be your successor.

01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:38.585
Not a woman whose own subjects
call her a harlot.

01:39:38.587 --> 01:39:41.154
This is Cecil speaking.

01:39:41.156 --> 01:39:43.425
I speak for myself.

01:39:44.693 --> 01:39:47.329
Though all your council agrees.

01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:55.171
How cruel men are.

01:40:32.611 --> 01:40:36.680
England does not look
so different from Scotland.

01:40:36.682 --> 01:40:41.087
Aye. They are sisters.

01:41:35.578 --> 01:41:37.479
Madam.

01:41:37.481 --> 01:41:38.548
Come away.

01:42:10.849 --> 01:42:12.783
I rode ahead.

01:42:12.785 --> 01:42:15.320
She'll be here soon.

01:42:16.354 --> 01:42:18.357
Remain here.

01:43:01.904 --> 01:43:03.238
Your Majesty.

01:43:41.579 --> 01:43:43.280
Cousin?

01:43:43.982 --> 01:43:45.817
Aye.

01:43:48.686 --> 01:43:50.555
Are you well?

01:43:51.556 --> 01:43:54.392
Your voice is not
what I expected.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:58.395
What did you expect of it?

01:43:58.397 --> 01:44:01.333
I do not know.

01:44:05.071 --> 01:44:07.907
How I long to see your face.

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:11.575
No one can know we meet.

01:44:11.577 --> 01:44:13.545
Yes, I have been instructed.

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:15.847
If you speak of it to anyone,
I shall deny.

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:18.449
And I will regard
your words as treason.

01:44:18.451 --> 01:44:20.587
Am I your subject now?

01:44:21.889 --> 01:44:23.390
No.

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:26.457
You are not my subject.

01:44:26.459 --> 01:44:29.463
But you do seek my help.

01:44:33.801 --> 01:44:37.405
I am grateful
for your protection.

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:41.441
I'm pleased to grant it.

01:44:41.443 --> 01:44:43.946
How did it come to this?

01:44:54.891 --> 01:44:56.893
May I see you, sister?

01:45:04.566 --> 01:45:06.870
My eyes are weary from travel.

01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:15.746
I should have stayed true
to your love.

01:45:17.082 --> 01:45:21.017
I should have followed
your example and never married.

01:45:21.019 --> 01:45:22.651
Then you would have no son.

01:45:22.653 --> 01:45:24.653
Whose mother is
without a crown,

01:45:24.655 --> 01:45:27.522
whose own throne is usurped
by his uncle.

01:45:27.524 --> 01:45:29.525
You must have faith.

01:45:29.527 --> 01:45:31.227
Your brother
will keep his word.

01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:33.531
I have no faith in him.

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:38.570
I have only faith in you.

01:45:40.739 --> 01:45:43.007
You would let them
show the world

01:45:43.009 --> 01:45:46.612
that a queen
can so easily be forsworn?

01:45:50.217 --> 01:45:52.550
Answer me, sister.

01:45:55.588 --> 01:45:57.255
To war with Scotland

01:45:57.257 --> 01:46:00.191
and betray my own clergy
on a Catholic's behalf,

01:46:00.193 --> 01:46:02.093
no, I cannot.

01:46:02.095 --> 01:46:04.430
You know I cannot.

01:46:06.934 --> 01:46:09.969
Did you come so far
at such great risk

01:46:09.971 --> 01:46:12.039
only to refuse me?

01:46:14.242 --> 01:46:16.576
I came...

01:46:18.579 --> 01:46:20.681
I came because...

01:46:31.693 --> 01:46:35.729
If you refuse me an army,
say it to my face.

01:46:35.731 --> 01:46:38.901
Do not force me to beg
to your back.

01:46:58.621 --> 01:47:01.056
I will kneel
before you if I must.

01:47:01.058 --> 01:47:03.928
It would make no difference.

01:47:08.631 --> 01:47:11.700
You are safe here in England.

01:47:11.702 --> 01:47:14.636
That's all I can offer.

01:47:14.638 --> 01:47:18.643
I have been abandoned
by so many.

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.515
I am utterly alone.

01:47:26.085 --> 01:47:28.053
As am I.

01:47:30.289 --> 01:47:32.125
Alone.

01:47:33.192 --> 01:47:35.594
Then be my sister.

01:47:38.064 --> 01:47:40.532
Be my boy's godmother.

01:47:41.834 --> 01:47:44.602
Together we could conquer
all of those who doubt us.

01:47:44.604 --> 01:47:46.604
Do not play into their hands.

01:47:46.606 --> 01:47:50.042
Our enmity is precisely
what they hope for.

01:47:50.044 --> 01:47:52.377
I know your heart
has more within it

01:47:52.379 --> 01:47:54.581
than the men who counsel you.

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:02.723
I am more man than woman now.

01:48:03.791 --> 01:48:06.161
The throne has made me so.

01:48:08.998 --> 01:48:12.634
But I have no enmity with you.

01:48:14.203 --> 01:48:16.837
Except to seed rebellion

01:48:16.839 --> 01:48:19.972
and to deceive me
time and time again?

01:48:19.974 --> 01:48:22.009
If you still seek
my protection,

01:48:22.011 --> 01:48:24.078
you would do well
to watch your words.

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.582
I will not be scolded
by my inferior.

01:48:27.384 --> 01:48:29.084
Your inferior?

01:48:29.086 --> 01:48:30.285
I am a Stuart...

01:48:30.287 --> 01:48:34.091
which gives me greater claim
to England than you possess.

01:48:44.701 --> 01:48:47.336
I had this made...

01:48:47.338 --> 01:48:51.207
because I wanted to present
the best version of myself.

01:48:57.182 --> 01:48:59.784
I was jealous.

01:49:04.188 --> 01:49:07.224
Your beauty.

01:49:07.226 --> 01:49:09.893
Your bravery.

01:49:09.895 --> 01:49:12.761
Your motherhood.

01:49:12.763 --> 01:49:15.934
You seem to surpass me
in every way.

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.776
But now I see there is
no cause for envy.

01:49:27.447 --> 01:49:29.214
Your gifts...

01:49:29.216 --> 01:49:31.483
are your downfall.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.129
What now, sister?

01:49:44.966 --> 01:49:48.267
You will still have
my protection,

01:49:48.269 --> 01:49:49.802
under my terms.

01:49:49.804 --> 01:49:51.404
Until you have me killed?

01:49:51.406 --> 01:49:53.072
I will do no such thing.

01:49:53.074 --> 01:49:54.807
Wouldn't you?

01:49:54.809 --> 01:49:56.943
As Henry killed your mother?

01:49:56.945 --> 01:50:00.346
I am not my father.

01:50:00.348 --> 01:50:02.749
But you share his blood.

01:50:05.821 --> 01:50:09.491
As long as you
do not provoke my enemies,

01:50:09.493 --> 01:50:11.994
you have nothing to fear.

01:50:14.096 --> 01:50:17.100
Your fate rests
in your own hands.

01:50:24.074 --> 01:50:26.942
If I seek to help your enemies,

01:50:26.944 --> 01:50:30.446
'tis only because you
pushed me to their arms.

01:50:30.448 --> 01:50:32.848
And should you murder me...

01:50:32.850 --> 01:50:36.318
remember you murder
your sister.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:39.854
And you murder your queen.

01:51:03.115 --> 01:51:06.219
Take her somewhere
you can guard her well.

01:51:50.433 --> 01:51:52.566
It's time.

01:51:54.903 --> 01:51:57.872
<i>Sister...</i>

01:51:57.874 --> 01:52:00.041
<i>evidence has been
presented to me,</i>

01:52:00.043 --> 01:52:03.044
<i>written in your hand.</i>

01:52:03.046 --> 01:52:04.478
<i>It shows that
you have conspired</i>

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:07.318
<i>with Catholic forces
against my life.</i>

01:52:08.919 --> 01:52:12.254
<i>Whether these letters
are in your hand or not,</i>

01:52:12.256 --> 01:52:14.058
<i>I must act.</i>

01:52:15.426 --> 01:52:20.228
<i>I wish I could speak
these words to you directly,</i>

01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:23.131
<i>but they exist only in my mind,</i>

01:52:23.133 --> 01:52:26.669
<i>as both a prayer and a penance.</i>

01:52:26.671 --> 01:52:29.240
<i>I hope that God will hear them.</i>

01:52:31.076 --> 01:52:34.010
<i>Believe me when I tell you
how it ages me</i>

01:52:34.012 --> 01:52:36.512
<i>to bear such a burden,</i>

01:52:36.514 --> 01:52:38.682
<i>ordering to death
the only other woman</i>

01:52:38.684 --> 01:52:43.322
<i>who knows what it means to rule
as a queen in this land.</i>

01:53:05.613 --> 01:53:09.315
<i>You were right when we spoke
a half lifetime ago.</i>

01:53:09.317 --> 01:53:12.418
<i>You said the day would come.</i>

01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:15.354
<i>And that day has come.</i>

01:53:15.356 --> 01:53:17.491
<i>I regret not doing then
what I do now,</i>

01:53:17.493 --> 01:53:20.159
<i>so that I could have
spared you so many years</i>

01:53:20.161 --> 01:53:22.462
<i>of imprisonment and misery.</i>

01:53:22.464 --> 01:53:25.165
<i>If you would lay eyes
upon me now,</i>

01:53:25.167 --> 01:53:28.368
<i>you would not recognize me.</i>

01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:31.304
<i>I have relinquished
all sense of self</i>

01:53:31.306 --> 01:53:35.575
<i>to the throne which rules
my every word and action.</i>

01:53:35.577 --> 01:53:40.581
<i>But when I think of you,
I see not an aged woman,</i>

01:53:40.583 --> 01:53:43.984
<i>but rather the young,
resplendent queen</i>

01:53:43.986 --> 01:53:45.621
<i>whose portrait
I first gazed upon</i>

01:53:45.623 --> 01:53:47.555
<i>five and 20 years ago,</i>

01:53:47.557 --> 01:53:51.092
<i>and whose beauty shone
so brightly when we met,</i>

01:53:51.094 --> 01:53:53.362
<i>despite her despair.</i>

01:53:59.703 --> 01:54:04.273
<i>I know God's arms will
accept you in that likeness,</i>

01:54:04.275 --> 01:54:06.476
<i>as the young, fierce queen</i>

01:54:06.478 --> 01:54:09.947
<i>who I have always
loved and admired.</i>

01:54:13.118 --> 01:54:16.519
<i>May your soul
have pity on mine.</i>

01:54:25.097 --> 01:54:27.098
Your Grace.

01:54:32.805 --> 01:54:34.806
Your Grace.

01:55:01.436 --> 01:55:04.239
By order of our sovereign
Elizabeth...

01:55:05.441 --> 01:55:09.276
...Queen of England,
Wales and Ireland;

01:55:09.278 --> 01:55:11.678
Overlord of Scotland;

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:16.148
certified by her privy council
and Parliament...

01:55:16.150 --> 01:55:19.288
Mary Stuart
is condemned to death...

01:55:23.359 --> 01:55:26.694
...this day, February the 8th,

01:55:26.696 --> 01:55:29.831
the year of our Lord 1587.

01:55:36.706 --> 01:55:39.543
She thinks herself a martyr.

01:55:43.414 --> 01:55:45.214
James...

01:55:45.216 --> 01:55:48.417
my only son...

01:55:48.419 --> 01:55:50.586
I pray that with your life

01:55:50.588 --> 01:55:53.623
you will succeed
where I could not,

01:55:53.625 --> 01:55:57.327
and for which
I am about to give my life.

01:55:57.329 --> 01:56:01.398
<i>In my end is my beginning.</i>

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:05.402
<i>I shall be watching you
from Heaven...</i>

01:56:05.404 --> 01:56:09.609
<i>as your crown one day
unites two kingdoms.</i>

01:56:19.252 --> 01:56:22.088
And we shall have peace.
