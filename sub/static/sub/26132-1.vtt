You're a dickhead.
Bye.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.386
Okay.

Who can tell us some of the symptoms
of coronary artery disease?

02:28.732 --> 02:30.723
 Sam?
 Chest pain.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.230
Yes, such as angina caused
by inadequate blood supply

02:34.237 --> 02:37.571
to the heart muscle.
What else? Yeah.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.111
Um, irregular
heartbeat, loud heartbeat.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.655
Palpitations, yes,
although, loud heartbeat

02:42.663 --> 02:45.246
is probably not a symptom
of an underlying condition.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.990
Unless, I suppose the patient
is falling ir1 love.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.706
All right, ventricles,
let's look at these.

03:05.477 --> 03:09.061
Leslie, hey!

03:09.064 --> 03:11.601

It's really just this one guy,
Jason Molina.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.756
He's amazing.
Well, he was amazing.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.220
He died a young man
before his time,

03:43.223 --> 03:46.511
but he was a genius.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.727
 Yeah, its really good.
 Yeah.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.971
This dual link vocal bit
right here...

03:54.776 --> 03:58.519
That's my...
That's my favorite part.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.525
<i>And he wrote the song</i> about

04:02.409 --> 04:04.366
the woman he would
eventually marry

04:04.369 --> 04:05.700
when they were
just a new couple, so,

04:05.704 --> 04:07.490
sort of a fresh love song.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.708
 You are in (or a real treat.

about a few things.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.678
Well, I'm free right now.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.765
Right.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.657
I have to close the shop, Les.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.574
Um...

04:52.793 --> 04:53.328
Okay.

04:56.171 --> 04:59.209
I'm sorry, Frank. I... I held off on
raising the rent as long as I onuld.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.168
No, it's okay.

X need lo be making.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.139

<i>And I...</i> I <i>mean. 17 years</i>

05:20.695 --> 05:22.185
Yeah. Yeah.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.197
Yeah.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.574
That's the big news
around these parls.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.569
I'm so sorry.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.324
I'm... I'm sorry,
I got to take this.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.996
You know.
I gel that she's elderly.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.621
But shoplifting
is shoplifting.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.293
I understand. She just gets a
little confused someiimes.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.043
I'm sure she didn't mean
to steal anything.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.170
All right, well, maybe somebody ought
to keep a closer eye on he r, yeah?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.764
We will, Officer. Thank you.

05:52.102 --> 05:52.716
Right, Mrs. Fisher.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.475
I'm gonna let you go this time

05:58.483 --> 06:00.144

lo see you here again.

06:44.821 --> 06:48.280
Hi.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.773
Who made these?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.027
Dustin Yelien.
This is his studio.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.072
How does it work?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.615
He places these tiny images
on slabs of glass

06:59.628 --> 07:02.666
and then stacks them together
so it makes one whole mace.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.756
It's very scientific.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.338
Like a preserved person.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.049
It's about how we each have
one self,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.805
but we're all made of more
lhan just one thing, you know?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.394
At bask. that's how
I interpret it.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.649
Move where?

07:27.656 --> 07:29.442
This phase is rentcontrolled.
I'm not gonna move.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.650
Why, do you wanna move me
into a home?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.236
Nobody's putting you
in a home, Ma.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.363
But...

07:38.375 --> 07:40.366
Maybe you could
come and five with me

07:40.377 --> 07:42.459
after Sam goes off
to school in the fall.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.749

07:44.756 --> 07:46.542
There are no trains
that go lo Red Hook, Frank.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.762
Well. we need to do something.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.779

08:38.393 --> 08:40.134
I'll look for it tomorrow.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.592
You smell like cigarettes.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.394
That might be my new Axe
body spray' scent, Brothel.

08:49.738 --> 08:53.151

08:53.158 --> 08:54.740

"Speak now.

“Hearts loud, we feel it
in our blond.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.891
“And now our hearts

14:12.894 --> 14:15.761
Its just a bunch of words.

I'm not even sure
it means anything.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.395

Dude. what you did was wrong.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.561
Sorry, wrong?

30:19.568 --> 30:21.058
Dad, 'you did it without
asking, without my permission.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.027
I mean, I could sue you.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.068
That would be
an excellent wee.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.570
"“Daughter sues father
over hit song."

30:29.578 --> 30:31.740
 It's not... Not a hit song.
 No?

30:31.747 --> 30:35.581
There ooulcl be like 50,000 people
today listening to cur song Today.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.744
I guess.
Sc: what do we do now'?

30:41.715 --> 30:44.503
Okay. Let's see.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.625
You said, '
there is no band.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.721
So...

30:51.058 --> 30:53.550
I guess that's it. I guess
we don't do anything now.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.722
I mean, we could
write another song.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.731
In fact, new tlwat we are
having this open dialogue,

31:02.069 --> 31:04.652
I wanted to show you something
I found the other day

31:04.654 --> 31:06.565

for your birth certificate.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.813

I'm sorry.
It's at... It's at home.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.741
This is my old notebook.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.624
Its full of lyrics and words
and poems.

31:19.628 --> 31:22.541
You have
a book of poems'?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.709
 Yeah'
 Tha\'s a poem, by you?

31:25.384 --> 31:28.797
That, excuse you,

31:29.054 --> 31:31.796
It's our new song.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.729
One, two, three...

34:23.603 --> 34:26.891
That's about Mom.

34:27.940 --> 34:28.429
Yeah. and you.

34:38.743 --> 34:42.407
It's a really good song. Dad.

34:56.553 --> 35:00.421
This is
a very thoughtful gesture.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.844
I (eel so awful
about the store closing.

35:04.060 --> 35:08.054
It's the least I could do.
You deserve a nice dinner.

35:08.064 --> 35:11.477
Well, thank you for doing the least you
can do because this is real ly great.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.986
And you look really nice,
tonight, Les.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.028
Aw, (hanks.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.696
So do you.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.535
It's my button shirt.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.168
To Red Hook Records.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.707
To Red Hook Records.

35:40.513 --> 35:44.051
Am I crazy
or do you seem cheerful?

35:44.934 --> 35:48.723
No, Sam and I are working
on a...

35:48.730 --> 35:50.471
Project.
It's going pretty well.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.519
Yeah?

35:53.943 --> 35:55.900
We're actually writing
some songs together.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.942
Really?
 Yeah, really.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.859
I mean. she has got chops.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.742
She's got a voice, too.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.578
I'm not surprised
to hear that.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.037
Wen, she doesn't get it
from me.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.998
She's leaving soon, right?

36:11.044 --> 36:13.536
I remember when Jack
went to college,

36:13.546 --> 36:15.457
he could not get away from me
fast enough.

37:03.596 --> 37:07.510
<i>I Got holes in my new jeans
for you</i>

37:15.191 --> 37:18.104
<i>I Got holes in my new jeans
for you</i>

37:28.121 --> 37:30.488
Damn, lady.
You got some pipes!

37:30.498 --> 37:33.866
Whoc!

38:11.080 --> 38:14.914
Sam talks to me now
like she's the adult.

38:14.918 --> 38:17.785
You know, that's just their way of making
it easier for you when they leave.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.833
So you don't m\ss 'em
so much.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.666
Being total ass holes.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.043
Jack did it to me.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.716
I did Mo my parents.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.549
God, I was a monster. You don't
know how easy you have it.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.893
Yeah. I know.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.687
When Sam was little,

38:40.109 --> 38:42.066
after Dani...

38:45.073 --> 38:48.862
We were like
little kids together.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.450
And that's how we gut through
all that.

38:54.165 --> 38:54.996
I have these moments
of immense pride.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.706
The first lime
she got a Groucho Joke.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.505
Stuff that reminded me
that I was her dad.

39:09.055 --> 39:12.548
Then. eventually,
she outgrew me.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.848
That's what happens.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.060
Done all you can do.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.066
She's great.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.650
You did good, Frank.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.880
Sorry.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.423
No, no. It's fine.

40:27.008 --> 40:30.592
What? No shot glasses?

40:30.595 --> 40:32.461
His is serious.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.755
There's rum that needs to be
properly savored.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.968
It's the real deal, Leslie.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.600
Got it from my guy in Mexico.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.598
Wow. ls your guy,
George C looney?

40:44.609 --> 40:46.941
I never reveal my sources.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.186
This is what we call
the good stuff.

40:49.197 --> 40:52.155
Right? It's like... It's like life.
You know you gotta

40:52.867 --> 40:55.780
slow down and enjoy it.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.782
Won't you join us?

41:00.625 --> 41:01.831
Yeah. you know...

41:02.919 --> 41:04.626
I think I will.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.121
Now, this stuff.
This stuff.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.761
That's so good.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.005
Excuse me.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.906

 WeTe just having a nightcap.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.112
This is m}; friend, Frank.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.035
 Hey. Ryan.
 Hi, there.

41:43.835 --> 41:44.825
Frank is my...

41:47.130 --> 41:49.462
Tenant.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.172
One of my tenants.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.836
Yes, she is my landlady.

41:56.222 --> 41:59.510
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Frank.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.054
 I'll see you around, Leslie.
 Yeah, see 'you soon.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.223
Take her easy.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.862
When submitting your show
history to Mercury Lounge,

42:17.869 --> 42:21.658
please be as specific as possible and
please do not exaggerate your draw.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.575
Show history?

42:27.253 --> 42:28.664
I think we can exaggerate
that a little.

42:29.839 --> 42:32.672
It specifically says
not to exaggerate.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.542
It says don't exaggerate
your draw.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.089
We dun'! have a draw, either.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.008
I'm gonna say our draw is 60.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.549
Nu. 65.

42:50.026 --> 42:53.894
No, it's faster than that.
Double time.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.863
 Okay.
 And one, two, three, four.

42:59.952 --> 43:03.490
Now, double the length.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.965
Was that right?

43:19.972 --> 43:21.883
I... I don't Know
what kind of song I'm writing.

43:23.726 --> 43:24.557
It's a love song.

43:27.021 --> 43:28.136
No' it's not.

43:28.648 --> 43:29.638
I think your lyrics
would disagree with you,

43:30.858 --> 43:32.974
my dear.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.267
Every song
is a love song, technically.

43:34.278 --> 43:38.237
<i>The Shah Sfeeps in Lee Harvey's
Grave by the Butthole Surfers?</i>

43:39.617 --> 43:42.109
Nut a love song.

43:42.870 --> 43:43.905
This is definitely
a love song.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.205
But a love song
for who exacfly?

43:49.127 --> 43:50.959
Whom.

43:52.255 --> 43:53.586
Fur whom.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.208
'Wanna bum your memory
in the back of my mind.

43:57.218 --> 44:00.210
"So I see your face
when I dose my eyes"?

44:01.764 --> 44:03.129
A, that's awesome.

44:05.101 --> 44:06.762
B, there's a lot of love
in there.

44:12.692 --> 44:16.185
 You have a girlfriend?

44:17.071 --> 44:17.606
<i>mam?
ma.</i>

44:37.717 --> 44:41.005
I have a girlfriend.

44:41.971 --> 44:42.460
Her name is Rose.

44:45.266 --> 44:46.552
She's an artist.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.221

44:50.271 --> 44:51.227
She's occl, I like her.
A lot.

44:53.107 --> 44:55.144

44:56.527 --> 44:57.983
Been great, but also,
it isrfl.

44:59.155 --> 45:01.112
How so?

45:04.202 --> 45:07.740
It's all in the song.

45:10.082 --> 45:13.541
That's good.

45:13.544 --> 45:14.909
When life
hands you conundrums.

45:17.173 --> 45:18.880
You tum 'em into art.

46:19.860 --> 46:23.319
It's good soup, Grandma.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.029
 Yeah?
»

46:25.032 --> 46:26.739
I just like to sit here
and just slurp my soup.

46:29.954 --> 46:32.286
It's a perfect meal
for a hot summer night.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.531
Okay, wise guy.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.249
 So, you still singing?

46:37.920 --> 46:39.831
Sometimes.

46:40.798 --> 46:41.959
I know when I was your age.

46:42.675 --> 46:44.666
I would g0 from nightclub
'to nightclub.

46:44.677 --> 46:47.260
Just trying,
trying to get a singing gig.

46:47.263 --> 46:51.131
But that's what
you had to do then.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.678
You took your am
from dour to dour

46:52.685 --> 46:54.267
And you had to show 'em... You
had to show 'em your stuff.

46:54.270 --> 46:56.557
And then one day, I walked into this club
in Long Island, It was the Three of Hearts.

46:58.899 --> 47:03.564
And the... And the owner said he didn't like
the look of me but could I carry a tuna'?

47:05.906 --> 47:07.613
Well, I just belted out a couple of...
a couple of bars QfAIJ of Me.

47:10.953 --> 47:14.537
And he knew, he knew.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.531
They put me on the stage
that very night

47:19.545 --> 47:23.209
Then aflerwarda
this handsome man came up.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.582
And he said, "You..."

47:26.552 --> 47:28.008
"Have the most beautiful
voice I've ever heard."

47:31.182 --> 47:32.889
I could tell by his eyes,
he meant it.

47:36.062 --> 47:37.052
It was my Eddie.

47:39.982 --> 47:40.847
Your grandfather.

47:45.071 --> 47:48.655
I really like that story.

47:48.657 --> 47:50.239
Yeah, he was shorter than me
but I didn't mind.

47:51.619 --> 47:53.735
 Gram!

47:54.914 --> 47:56.700
That's true.

48:32.201 --> 48:33.566
Hey. Hal

48:35.079 --> 48:38.117
I just don't think this is
gonna cut it for you, Frank.

48:38.124 --> 48:39.910
I know, but this is income.

48:39.917 --> 48:43.285
Also my' meat and cheese
background is really strong, so...

48:43.295 --> 48:46.287
<i>\</i> think I got
a pretty good chance.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.042
Okay, listen. I've... I've actually
been wanting to talk to you

48:51.053 --> 48:54.591
because um, I've been thinking
about something and...

48:55.099 --> 48:57.761
I have a proposition for you.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.760
Okay, so, what if
we brightened it up in here?

49:02.565 --> 49:05.182
You know, get some cool, new
woodpaneled record bins and...

49:05.860 --> 49:09.694
I don't know. Reorganize,
fix the flow.

49:09.697 --> 49:12.530
Make it feel open and fresh
and clean.

49:13.325 --> 49:16.568
I dun'! know.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.573
I like to think my flow
is super fresh.

49:21.667 --> 49:22.907
I like“ . I like the certain
patina that I've developed.

49:22.918 --> 49:26.286
We could clear out this area over
here, put a barista in there.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.289
I do like coffee.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.667
It'll be a fresh start. We
can draw up a business plan

49:32.678 --> 49:35.090
and a rebranding strategy.
_llwe'll?

49:35.097 --> 49:37.634
<i>Farmers. 'SQED.</i>

49:38.893 --> 49:39.883
Why?

49:42.062 --> 49:43.803
Because I know a good thing
when I see it.

49:43.814 --> 49:45.725
I believe
in this store, Frank.

49:46.609 --> 49:48.691
And honestly, I think it
has a lot of potential.

49:54.950 --> 49:56.281
 This is so good!
 Really?

49:59.121 --> 50:01.283
You wrote this?

50:02.583 --> 50:03.664
Yeah.
um. With my dad.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.662
 Frank?
 Yes.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.673
I gotta say, I was a little worried
when you asked me to listen to it.

50:12.676 --> 50:16.135
What'? You thought
I was gonna suck?

50:16.138 --> 50:17.845
Yeah.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.674
Would you tell me?

50:21.685 --> 50:23.175
 I mean, I would be out that door.

50:26.982 --> 50:30.145
My dad was in a band
with my mom

50:30.152 --> 50:32.814
before I was born.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.645
So, obviously (ms is...

50:36.742 --> 50:38.324
More his thing.

50:39.787 --> 50:41.653
Plus, I don't think we're good
enough for an audience, anyways.

50:46.710 --> 50:50.544
You gotta be brave
before you can be good.

50:52.883 --> 50:56.126
What is that?

50:56.136 --> 50:57.718
I read it in a comic book.

51:00.641 --> 51:03.724
You are brave. though.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.559
And you're good.

51:09.108 --> 51:12.817
<i>L</i> just think

51:34.758 --> 51:37.796
Well, when yowre a doctor and
I'm still a starving artist,

51:37.803 --> 51:40.966

55:00.756 --> 55:02.793
 So, a gentleman
came by the shop today'

55:03.383 --> 55:07.342
from a little outfit
called Silly Bird Records,

55:07.346 --> 55:09.963
and he wants to rep us.

55:10.766 --> 55:12.256
He thinks the song

55:14.061 --> 55:15.768
He trunks.

55:15.771 --> 55:17.887
He wants us to cut an EP.
maybe even go on tour.

55:19.149 --> 55:22.062
Can you believe this?

55:22.069 --> 55:24.185
He said...
He said to me,

55:24.196 --> 55:25.903
"'We can really monetize this
thing if we do it properly."

55:29.952 --> 55:33.411
I thought you'd be excited.

55:33.413 --> 55:34.744
Dude, I have in like a week.

55:37.209 --> 55:38.119
Dad, I can't stay and record

Why not?

55:46.093 --> 55:47.675
Seriou sly?

55:48.345 --> 55:49.801
Are you suggesting that
I don't go to college

55:51.890 --> 55:53.801
so that I can stay
and be in a band wnh you?

55:53.809 --> 55:55.846
I don't know...

55:56.645 --> 55:57.760
No, not. not go. but...

55:57.771 --> 56:00.729
I thought, maybe you could take a
year off and we'll see what happens.

56:01.942 --> 56:05.105
You were in a band
20 years ago and had a deal.

56:05.779 --> 56:07.144
Where's your hi! record?

56:09.199 --> 56:10.405

Going to be a doctor.

56:18.667 --> 56:20.283
Going somewhere? Do you

56:20.294 --> 56:22.626
The shop is closing.

You're broke.

56:24.965 --> 56:26.831
So, what?

56:47.404 --> 56:49.315
Du you know how many people
would kill to have

56:49.323 --> 56:52.156
even an ounce of the talent
that you have?

56:52.159 --> 56:55.777
This is not something that you just give
up. Not when all of this is happening.

56:56.204 --> 56:59.742
Nothing is happening!

56:59.750 --> 57:00.990
I'm not giving anything up!

57:01.001 --> 57:02.867
You have the same thing inside
you that your mother had.

57:05.881 --> 57:06.962
And if she were here.
right now...

57:08.300 --> 57:09.882
No. you don't get to do that.

57:12.179 --> 57:15.968
She would say
the same damn thing!

57:21.355 --> 57:24.893
Can I get another shot?

57:26.693 --> 57:29.856
Vuu...

You like owning
your own place, Dave'?

Last one,

58:09.945 --> 58:14.064
You know how much a year at UCLA cost?
Speaking of doctors.

58:17.953 --> 58:19.034
$62,000.

58:19.037 --> 58:20.994
Whoa!

58:20.998 --> 58:22.784
I mean. we're1ust
paying 12,000.

58:22.791 --> 58:24.998
That's what they call a great
financial aid package.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.998
Don't have a dime
lo your name? 12,000 bucks.

58:31.800 --> 58:32.380
Well, think of it this way.

58:35.262 --> 58:37.253
You know,
after all that money's spent,

58:37.264 --> 58:39.221
she's gonna end up being
a doctor.

58:46.732 --> 58:50.020
One more time.

58:50.027 --> 58:52.018
 You said last one on the last one.
 Cor'ne on, man.

58:55.032 --> 58:58.991
This is not a professional
relationship, Frankie.

58:59.911 --> 59:02.278
I'm your friend.

59:21.266 --> 59:24.759
Frank, what's up?

59:24.770 --> 59:25.931
What am I to you, anyway?

59:28.315 --> 59:29.305
Sorry?

59:31.485 --> 59:33.101
I don't know. I mean,

59:33.111 --> 59:35.022
I'm a business opportunity?

59:35.322 --> 59:36.812
You're my friend.

59:38.825 --> 59:39.906
We're friends.

59:40.994 --> 59:42.234
Friends.

59:43.330 --> 59:44.661
Right, we' re friends.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.281
Don't they say' you should never
go into business with a friend?

59:49.961 --> 59:52.202
 I've thought
about your proposal.

59:53.924 --> 59:56.256
 Frank.
 I thought it over and the answer is no.

59:56.259 --> 59:58.967
I think maybe we should have
this conversation another time.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:01.462
Nu, I wanna have it new.

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:03.259
The store isn't failing
because I need a barista

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:07.184
to make it smell like coffee.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.769
The store is failing 'cause I
don't wanna do it anymore.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.059
I don't wanna sell music.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:18.066
So...

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.188
Cold cum and cheese (or me.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:20.989
Well, that's admirable.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:25.118
You're goddamn right, it is.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:32.080
What about Ryan?

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:33.418
Okay, I think you should
go home now.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.831
Why?
We don't wanna wake up Ryan?

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.253
<i>Good night, Frank.</i>

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:46.223
Hey, well, at least
we're still friends, right'?

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:58.142
Her belongings.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.805
Sir, I need her to take it.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.224
I'm the sun.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.221
But she paid the bail.

I learned to ride
a bike today.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:10.248

Sounds nice.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:13.397
It was.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:14.982
There are trees there, man.
Just...

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:20.066
We heard that.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:23.907
How can I help, Flank?

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:31.878
You know...

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:32.871
Every now and then. Frankie.

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:37.300
We have to accept
our circumstances

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:41.213
and adapt accordingly.

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:44.265
Pretty wise words

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.141
from a guy who went
all (he way to Woodstock

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.934
to smoke a bunch of weed.

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:52.273
There were trees there, Frank.

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:55.940
I went (or the trees, buddy.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.443

You're gonna be all right.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:26.466
<i>Hg?'</i>

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:27.511
<i>Hg?'</i>

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:03.420
Dad, you can't sell this

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:19.027
This sucks.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:23.778
You're telling me.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:34.751
Hey, Les'
it's Frank. Um...

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.332
I was just thinking
about you

01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:40.836
because today is the last day
01 Red Hook Records.

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:44.169
Just wanted to say

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.055

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:50.850
I know that I am ajerk.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.062
And...

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:57.390
I hope that you will
forgive me.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:03.465
Hey, I just thought
of something.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.880
 Okay.
 You know the Titanic?

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:07.503
That's cheery.

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:10.089
There was a band
that was playing

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.931
while it was sinking.

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:38.996
 Who's playing?
 Theyfre called WeWe Not A Band.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:42.337
Cool. How are they?

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.796

Got it.

Me too.

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:45.059
Let's just do our thing.

What thing?

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.281
I mean,

Cool. Let's just do
what we always do.

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:56.444
Just m from of some people.

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.822
Hey, that's what

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:08.836
Hello.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:11.376
Hi.

01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:13.503
Thank you all
for coming out

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.010
So, this store, um,

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.306
it came about
because I love music.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.064
My whole family
loves music.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.559
And so, we opened this shop

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.437
almost 1? years ago
because of that very fact.

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:34.445
What's up, Lance?

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.410
Where's your Brian Eno?

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.367
Um. 17 years is...

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.416
It's hard to believe.

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:46.418
Um. anyway'

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.877
I'm gonna be very sad
to see it go.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.044
But all things must change,
and...

01:13:58.476 --> 01:13:59.966
Well, that is,
that is life.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:08.600
But thank you all for coming.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.608

Of course, it's ready.
M's now or never.

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:15.628

<i>Dad, let's just do
Everything Must Go.</i>

01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:18.665
But that's our big finale.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.087
Everything <i>Mus!</i> Go
is our big finale.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.584
Are you really not
gonna play this song?

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:23.837
Sam. Sam.

Thank you. Thank you so

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:18.905
I think this might be
our last song.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:22.541
We have not been a band
for very long.

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:27.672
Um, but this is
a very special song.

01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:33.010
It's about this place

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.262
