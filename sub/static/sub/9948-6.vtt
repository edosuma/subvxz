Anyone watching thinking we know
fuck all

00:03.100 --> 00:07.099
about knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.459
So, you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:10.460 --> 00:12.219
sending prices sky-high.

00:12.220 --> 00:16.219
Literally, literally taking the grass
from its own roots!

00:16.335 --> 00:19.659
Now you've got your Con-Dem Nation.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.699
Liberals noshing Tories,
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:22.700 --> 00:25.099
Have we had a national
fucking stroke,

00:25.100 --> 00:26.979
or what?

00:26.980 --> 00:30.059
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:30.060 --> 00:32.579
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:32.580 --> 00:36.019
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.020 --> 00:39.979
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester,

00:39.980 --> 00:43.059
and they charge us for water!

00:43.060 --> 00:47.375
I wandered lonely as a clown
Necking mushrooms rarely found

00:47.420 --> 00:50.619
This green and pleasant land
In ancient times...

00:50.620 --> 00:53.219
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:53.220 --> 00:56.499
It's not theirs any more.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.019
This is our England now.

00:59.020 --> 01:01.775
Party!

about in the woods with a monk,

'Finders keepers.'

you fucking slut!

01:27.740 --> 01:30.779

01:30.780 --> 01:33.779

Bollocks!

02:07.260 --> 02:08.299
What's this?

02:08.300 --> 02:10.619
What's it look like?

02:15.420 --> 02:17.419
Just, you know I'm good for it.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.979
Are you? Look, Shane,
I know how it is, OK?

02:19.980 --> 02:21.139
And if things are tight,

02:21.140 --> 02:24.219
I could always find a few bits
for you to do round here until...

02:24.220 --> 02:27.219
Yeah. You'd love that, you,
wouldn't you? Go on.

02:27.220 --> 02:31.019
What've you got in mind, ferreting
tumble-pubes out the urinal?

02:31.020 --> 02:33.739
I'll even throw in a pair
of marigolds.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.699
Thanks... I'm not a charity case!

02:35.700 --> 02:39.339
Fine. We'll stop treating you

Yeah? I'm sure you'll be
very happy together.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.619
Don't know how that got there.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.899
Aye!

03:16.900 --> 03:18.499
Dirty bastard.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.379
Human Centipede,
supposed to be well funny.

03:22.380 --> 03:26.379
Yeah, about that.
I can't make it, sorry.

03:27.260 --> 03:28.619
Clem put her foot down, has she?

03:28.620 --> 03:30.219
Mate, come with us if you like.

03:30.220 --> 03:32.979
We're not doin' owt,
just having a drink by the canal.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.979
Nah, no thanks... wouldn't want
to be a... sixth wheel.

03:40.500 --> 03:44.499
That's funny. See ya later.

03:47.780 --> 03:50.339
So, how's tall, black and jobless?

03:50.340 --> 03:52.219
Nothing about, work-wise.

03:52.220 --> 03:53.779
All the fight's gone out of him,

03:53.780 --> 03:57.779
he seems resigned to curling up
and licking his wounds.

03:57.860 --> 04:01.859
I used to be able to do that.
Before me back.

04:02.820 --> 04:06.099
Seriously, Gloria,
what is that smell?

04:06.100 --> 04:07.619
What smell?

04:07.620 --> 04:09.819
It smells like... sex.

04:17.540 --> 04:21.539
There's a naked man climbing
out from your laundry basket!

04:23.580 --> 04:26.539
Dominic. Do we need to see that
first thing?

04:26.540 --> 04:30.219
I'm trying to earn me keep. Out!

04:31.180 --> 04:35.179
Ladies.

04:36.620 --> 04:40.619
Dominic!

04:41.700 --> 04:42.379
Who was that?

04:42.380 --> 04:43.659
Me brother.

04:43.660 --> 04:44.539
The priest?!

04:44.540 --> 04:46.739
What is it with priests
and big nobs?

04:47.900 --> 04:51.899
It's not funny!

05:03.900 --> 05:05.459
Catherine.

05:05.460 --> 05:09.379
Now then, Dom.
Didn't know you was back?

05:09.380 --> 05:10.939
Where's the dog collar?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.019
Dry cleaners.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.459
Can I have a pint, please and,
a couple of chasers?

05:15.460 --> 05:17.939
You haven't lost the faith?

05:17.940 --> 05:20.219
You've not gone Protestant,
have you?!

05:20.220 --> 05:23.699
No, no, I'm just having a break,
that's all.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.539
How'd you wangle that?

05:24.540 --> 05:28.499
Won a draw, names in a mitre.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.499
How comes you not been in to see us,
then? What you been doing?

05:36.020 --> 05:40.019
Just keeping busy.

05:44.820 --> 05:47.979
No, this is better than money,
I'm telling you.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.739
It's a two-man operation, like.
I'd help meself, but...

05:50.740 --> 05:52.518
How many cigarettes are we talking,
here?

05:52.573 --> 05:54.059
Enough.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.859
Delivery guy always stops at this
one particular store,

05:56.860 --> 05:59.019
then goes in for a bit
of extra-marital

05:59.020 --> 06:00.539
with one of the late shift.

06:00.540 --> 06:03.139
Leaves his van just sitting there,
half stocked.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.179
Two-man job, yeah?

06:04.180 --> 06:06.139
Maybe ask one of your brothers?

06:06.140 --> 06:08.779
I have got other mates,
thank you.

06:08.780 --> 06:12.779
Course you have. So, are we squits,
then?

06:26.300 --> 06:30.299
Yeah. We squits.

06:46.420 --> 06:47.579
Enjoying your tap water?

06:47.580 --> 06:50.819
Champion.

06:50.820 --> 06:53.819
Fuck 'em! Cock!

06:53.820 --> 06:57.819
Shake-and-vac!

06:58.020 --> 07:02.019
Don't afford what
you can't touch.

07:04.260 --> 07:05.819
Kelly.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.819
What?!

07:14.380 --> 07:18.379
You fucking wish!

07:32.100 --> 07:34.579
Do you reckon he had somebody
at the house with him?

07:34.580 --> 07:37.579
Well, he claims he can't remember,
but there was someone,

07:37.580 --> 07:39.019
I'll tell you that.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.179
Cos I just spent the afternoon

07:41.180 --> 07:45.179
wire-brushing the dry remnants
of her off me fucking sofa cushions.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.979
Are priests allowed to do that?

07:48.980 --> 07:50.899
He's a dogma unto himself,
that one.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.299
And besides,
he's on "extended sabbatical."

07:53.300 --> 07:54.459
Why?

07:54.460 --> 07:56.099
He won a draw.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.459
Yeah, and the second prize was
a Popemobile.

07:58.460 --> 07:59.499
Right.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.059
"Popemobile"!

08:05.060 --> 08:07.059
Because it's stealing.

08:07.060 --> 08:09.619
Because it's against the law!

08:09.620 --> 08:13.619
The law? And the fucking law's
done us a lot of favours recently,

08:13.620 --> 08:15.299
hasn't it, Jackson?

08:15.300 --> 08:18.379
Right, right. So this is
all about revenge, is it?

08:18.380 --> 08:19.779
Sticking it to the man?

08:19.780 --> 08:21.419
Look, if it makes you feel better,

08:21.420 --> 08:24.539
for me it's about the money.
A lot of money, actually.

08:24.540 --> 08:27.339
Each. A 60-40 split.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.139
I don't care how much it is,
I'm not risking me whole...

08:31.140 --> 08:33.578
Hang on, what do you mean,
"60-40"?

08:33.580 --> 08:36.619
Well, it's my gig, innit?
I'm providing the transport.

08:36.620 --> 08:39.179
Hey, I'm doing anything,
then it's 50-50 or nothing.

08:39.179 --> 08:43.179
Does this mean you're in?

08:44.660 --> 08:45.699
Easy, you say?

08:45.700 --> 08:47.529
Fish in a barrel.

08:53.790 --> 08:55.469
You are sure?

08:55.470 --> 08:59.469
Never been surer.

09:07.270 --> 09:09.669
Is that Ches?
Thought you said he wasn't coming.

09:09.670 --> 09:12.549
Who's that with him?

09:12.550 --> 09:14.989
Looks like Lise...
Call her Toploader.

09:14.990 --> 09:15.989
Toploader?

09:15.990 --> 09:19.989
Yeah.

09:22.710 --> 09:25.429
All right? This is Clem... Lise.

09:25.430 --> 09:28.389
How's it going?
And you know Carl...

09:30.670 --> 09:32.708
Yeah, we've met.

09:35.550 --> 09:39.549
Right, I'll get on the bevs.

09:39.974 --> 09:42.029
Hey... you're in a wheelchair.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.549
So I am

09:43.550 --> 09:47.549
Good for you.

09:48.910 --> 09:50.309
Them are some big tits.

09:50.310 --> 09:54.309
Thanks!

09:58.030 --> 10:02.029
Jesus Christ,
get you a fucking bell or something.

10:14.910 --> 10:16.069
Well?

10:16.070 --> 10:19.309
Well, I was thinking
more of an inner city, council-run

10:19.310 --> 10:21.789
nursin' home meself,
but if you think they'll have you...

10:21.790 --> 10:24.109
For Stella!

10:24.110 --> 10:26.069
Her birthday.

10:26.070 --> 10:29.269
Tomorrow!

10:29.270 --> 10:31.789
I know it's her birthday tomorrow.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.309
Think I don't know
me own daughter's birthday?

10:34.310 --> 10:36.029
That's tomorrow!

10:36.030 --> 10:40.029
Her birthday was two months ago...
you IOU'd her a special day out.

10:40.550 --> 10:42.349
I'm a bit strapped.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.589
It's free admission.

10:43.590 --> 10:47.589
I also can't be bothered.

10:51.390 --> 10:55.389
No, no, if you think having
a stroke's gonna guilt-trip me...

10:56.230 --> 10:59.229
It's muscle fatigue, comes and goes.

10:59.230 --> 11:01.709
I'll barely be able to
move by the morning,

11:01.710 --> 11:05.549
probably going to need help
getting on and off the toilet...

11:05.550 --> 11:07.549
Fine! I'll go.

11:07.550 --> 11:11.029
Are you gonna tell them or what?

11:11.030 --> 11:14.229
Yeah... I'm moving in with Clem.

11:14.230 --> 11:18.229
Way to sound enthusiastic Carl,
cheers.

11:19.110 --> 11:21.509
It's a bit... sudden, innit?

11:21.510 --> 11:25.509
Sorry, don't you mean
"congratulations"?

11:26.790 --> 11:30.269
Yeah. 'Course.
Congratulations, mate.

11:30.270 --> 11:34.269
Cheers.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.469
So I'll see you at 10:30
in the morning,

11:38.470 --> 11:42.469
for highlights and a blow-dry.
All right, bye love.

12:02.070 --> 12:06.029
Nice Who's it from?

12:06.030 --> 12:08.069
Could be anyone, couldn't it,

12:08.070 --> 12:10.989
but if I had to guess I'd say
it's the sober half of

12:10.990 --> 12:14.989
whoever you were up to your balls in
last night.

12:16.670 --> 12:19.909
Aren't you worried he knows where
you're living... sorry, sponging?

12:19.910 --> 12:23.509
He won't follow through. People
don't commit to anything these days.

12:23.510 --> 12:27.069
I hope not. It'll be hard for me
to coax punters through the door

12:27.070 --> 12:30.149
with your bollocks nailed
to the outside of it.

12:30.150 --> 12:34.149
Something you said then...
You got me thinking.

12:34.310 --> 12:38.309
What did? "Bollocks" or "nailed"?

12:44.110 --> 12:48.109
Yes...

12:49.270 --> 12:50.429
Brilliant.

12:50.430 --> 12:51.629
Who'd you shag?

12:51.630 --> 12:53.669
Cinderella?

12:53.670 --> 12:55.949
Shall we take it round pubs...
"Whomsoever this bra fits..."

12:55.950 --> 12:59.949
I'm game.

13:01.710 --> 13:04.709
Right. Here we go.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.509
You done this kind of thing a lot?

13:06.510 --> 13:08.949
I like to think I'm an old pro,
yeah.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.869
Ever got caught?

13:11.870 --> 13:15.869
Wonderful

13:18.950 --> 13:21.389
Right, let him get in there,

13:21.390 --> 13:25.029
give 'em a couple of minutes, let
'em start getting their jiggy on...

13:25.030 --> 13:26.669
In case of cameras.

13:26.670 --> 13:29.789
What makes you think there'd be...
Did you bring me one?

13:29.790 --> 13:30.309
No.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.469
Why not?

13:31.470 --> 13:35.469
I figured you'd bring your own.
Old pro an' all.

13:39.190 --> 13:43.189
(Come on, you fuckin' idiot... )

13:54.310 --> 13:57.349
Right... Off you go.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.429
You what?

13:58.430 --> 14:02.309
One of us has got to stay up here,
right?

14:02.310 --> 14:04.949
Throw us as much as you can,
and I'll help you back up.

14:04.950 --> 14:06.109
Why don't you go down there and...

14:06.110 --> 14:08.309
Bagsie up here!

14:08.310 --> 14:12.309
Sorry... law of the playground.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.309
It's not fucking Belmarsh!

14:16.310 --> 14:19.469
Fuck's sake.

14:19.470 --> 14:23.469
Get over.

14:30.198 --> 14:32.429
Get over!

14:32.679 --> 14:36.979
I'm trying...

14:38.456 --> 14:40.535
My mask!

14:40.630 --> 14:44.629
For fuck's sake...

14:54.368 --> 14:56.893
Oi! I thought you only said
you had one pair.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.166
Think I'm letting you
stick your face in my wife's tights?

14:59.218 --> 15:01.177
Whatever, Jackson,
just get on with it!

15:01.234 --> 15:05.233
He's probably mentally counting off
the England '96 squad by now.

15:11.732 --> 15:13.131
It's locked.

15:13.149 --> 15:14.788
It opens upwards!

15:14.890 --> 15:18.889
You've a lot to say for a spectator!

15:23.320 --> 15:25.599
What are you doing?!

15:25.600 --> 15:27.239
Having a look.

15:27.240 --> 15:31.239
Who's going to get us
back up there now?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.999
- Y'all right?
- Yeah.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.639
Look, mate, you can do better.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.719
Say that again?

15:41.720 --> 15:43.639
Fuck's sake, Carl, she's...

15:43.640 --> 15:45.487
What?

15:45.577 --> 15:47.056
You know...

15:47.635 --> 15:49.020
I mean, can she even...?

15:49.060 --> 15:50.539
Yeah, she can.

15:50.571 --> 15:53.146
And a fuck lot better than
Toploader too.

15:53.284 --> 15:54.283
You and Lise?!

15:54.526 --> 15:55.805
Me and a lot of birds...

15:56.025 --> 15:58.344
and none of them,
not one... even come close.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.857
You need to start
opening your eyes seriously, man.

16:00.942 --> 16:03.461
The way she talks all the time,
big "I am"...

16:03.611 --> 16:05.610
Anybody can go to university,
you know.

16:05.822 --> 16:07.221
They probably only took her cos
she's...

16:07.277 --> 16:09.302
Fuck you. Fuck off.

16:09.657 --> 16:11.096
What...?

16:11.840 --> 16:14.239
We're going.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.479
Bye-bye!

16:15.480 --> 16:17.357
Bye-bye.

16:17.461 --> 16:19.340
Fuck! OK...

16:19.365 --> 16:21.476
(Calm down... )
Right. We'll take the whole thing,

16:21.509 --> 16:23.630
we'll ride it out the front
like Butch Cassidy.

16:23.702 --> 16:25.857
How did we go from nicking fags
to grand theft auto?

16:25.902 --> 16:29.901
It's called improvising, Jackson!

16:35.240 --> 16:39.239
Stand back.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.539
Shit!

16:46.594 --> 16:49.153
Sorry...
That's my arse!

16:49.294 --> 16:51.053
Dickhead, I said stand back!

16:51.360 --> 16:53.959
Oi!

16:53.960 --> 16:57.959
Derek...!

17:06.160 --> 17:10.159
Fish in a barrel?!

17:13.599 --> 17:17.598
Shit...

17:27.520 --> 17:30.239
Shane!

17:30.240 --> 17:34.239
Shane!

18:02.640 --> 18:04.479
Hello!

18:04.480 --> 18:06.079
What's all this then?

18:06.080 --> 18:08.799
It's, contributions for the farm.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.799
I thought it was free.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.159
Yeah... go on, off you go, chicken.

18:56.160 --> 19:00.159
I think we're done here, Princess.

19:06.290 --> 19:09.369
Just remember...
if the old bag asks...

19:22.210 --> 19:26.169
Come on...

19:26.170 --> 19:29.569
Wasn't my fault.

19:29.570 --> 19:34.754
Never... work with amateurs.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.929
That your dinner is it?

19:39.930 --> 19:43.929
Since you blew our pay day, as a
matter of fact it is Jackson, yeah.

19:44.005 --> 19:45.569
I grabbed it
when you knocked all the shit over.

19:45.570 --> 19:49.569
That was you!

19:56.370 --> 19:58.169
They're out of date.

19:58.170 --> 20:03.055
Sell-by's are bollocks. You can
always add a week on. Besides,

20:03.090 --> 20:04.329
it's fuckin' free,

20:04.330 --> 20:05.889
what d'you want?

20:05.890 --> 20:08.016
Cost two quid in the shops, them.

20:10.730 --> 20:12.769
Lise...

20:15.490 --> 20:19.289
I've been thinking. We're
getting on all right, aren't we?

20:19.290 --> 20:20.798
Yeah.

20:24.170 --> 20:27.929
So... what do you reckon
we just go for it?

20:27.930 --> 20:30.243
Why don't you move in with me?

20:33.410 --> 20:34.929
Well...

20:34.930 --> 20:36.089
I'll have to ask Ryan.

20:36.829 --> 20:38.340
Who's Ryan?

20:38.383 --> 20:40.289
He's sort of my boyfriend...

20:40.290 --> 20:44.289
But I'll definitely think about it.

20:44.505 --> 20:46.784
All right?

20:46.902 --> 20:50.901
Hiya, you.

20:50.951 --> 20:52.430
So...

20:52.524 --> 20:55.563
What we gonna do about it, then?

20:56.627 --> 21:01.221
He's your best mate, I'm a wheelie.
I'm not good enough for him, right?

21:01.283 --> 21:02.801
Don't talk shite.

21:04.170 --> 21:07.529
Well, tomorrow, me and you
are going on a picnic,

21:07.530 --> 21:08.849
we'll take it from there.

21:08.850 --> 21:12.089
You don't mind me going on a date
with your boyfriend, do you?

21:14.730 --> 21:17.049
I didn't even know you knew Ryan.

21:17.401 --> 21:21.400
Yeah. If you like. I'm probably
moving in with Ches anyway.

21:25.557 --> 21:26.809
Right...

21:27.551 --> 21:29.259
See you tomorrow.

21:34.964 --> 21:36.588
I don't get it.

21:37.450 --> 21:39.169
Why risk our arses nicking stuff

21:39.170 --> 21:41.129
they're going to be
keeping an eye on?

21:41.130 --> 21:45.129
Take stuff past its sell-by,
sell it on... money for nothing.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.609
So you want us to...

21:48.610 --> 21:51.009
(to steal... garbage?)

21:51.010 --> 21:52.529
Yes!

21:52.530 --> 21:55.409
And do what with it?
Flog it off street corners?

21:55.410 --> 21:58.049
Jackson, look at me.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.129
Do I look like
a fuckin' fruit and veg man?

22:01.130 --> 22:04.009
A little, yeah. But you're missing
the bigger picture.

22:04.010 --> 22:06.889
I'm talking take in bulk,
sell in bulk.

22:06.890 --> 22:10.169
Schools, kitchens... anywhere
that's after cutting corners

22:10.170 --> 22:12.169
and saving pennies.

22:12.170 --> 22:16.169
There's profit in their rubbish.

22:16.930 --> 22:20.929
It's original, I'll give you that.

22:27.890 --> 22:30.329
Jog any memories?

22:30.330 --> 22:34.329
Didn't wear matching underwear,
so a classy bird as usual...

22:37.170 --> 22:39.209
She wasn't blonde after all.

22:39.210 --> 22:41.089
She was a redhead.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.809
Good!

22:42.810 --> 22:44.369
We're narrowing it down then.

22:45.410 --> 22:49.409
Open this door, you fuckin' twat!

22:49.570 --> 22:53.569
What are you doing, he'll beat
the crap out of you! Shut up!

22:54.010 --> 22:56.169
Do you want me to torch
your fuckin' place?!

22:56.170 --> 22:59.169
Do you think he wants these back?

22:59.170 --> 23:00.889
Open the fuckin' door!

23:01.930 --> 23:03.489
You twat!

23:03.490 --> 23:06.889
You're fuckin' dead. I'm fuckin'
coming for you, I'm telling you!

23:06.890 --> 23:08.009
I think he's gone.

23:08.010 --> 23:09.529
It's OK, stay there.

23:09.530 --> 23:11.129
Ssh, it's OK...

23:11.130 --> 23:14.649
Don't...

23:14.650 --> 23:17.609
It's all right, he's gone.

23:17.610 --> 23:20.289
See?
I told you it'd be OK, didn't I?

23:27.269 --> 23:28.708
You could give us a hand?

23:28.710 --> 23:32.349
I do love you, Glores,
but... manual labour?

23:32.350 --> 23:34.299
Jesus was a carpenter!

23:34.335 --> 23:36.854
Yeah... Look where it got him.

23:43.390 --> 23:44.838
Dom?

23:50.274 --> 23:51.789
This is stupid.

23:51.790 --> 23:55.789
You're a very negative person, Ches.

23:55.790 --> 23:59.789
A nice picnic is just what we need
to get to know each other.

24:03.218 --> 24:05.937
So, apart from the fact
he's going out with me,

24:06.180 --> 24:09.099
I hear you're fucked off with
our Carl for not joining you

24:09.155 --> 24:10.461
on the reccie drugs any more?

24:10.509 --> 24:12.211
Yeah, well what do you expect?

24:12.307 --> 24:16.146
Now that he's all, "uphold the law,"
"serve the public trust."

24:16.225 --> 24:18.322
Sickening, isn't it? So...

24:22.150 --> 24:24.029
regular...

24:24.030 --> 24:28.029
or decaf?

24:28.112 --> 24:30.991
Was I here a few nights ago?

24:31.007 --> 24:32.242
I wasn't on.

24:32.314 --> 24:33.429
Do you get any redheads in?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.269
Well, just Ginger Pete.

24:35.270 --> 24:38.069
Unless he's a 32C, he's probably
not who I'm after.

24:38.070 --> 24:39.103
Pint?

24:39.126 --> 24:39.989
Real leather?

24:39.990 --> 24:41.589
What?

24:41.590 --> 24:44.029
LEATHER!

24:44.030 --> 24:44.749
Kelly!

24:44.750 --> 24:47.189
What the fuck?
She called me a fucking lesbian!

24:50.830 --> 24:51.949
You're barred.

24:51.950 --> 24:55.949
You are barred.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.189
Eight.

25:10.190 --> 25:12.109
What?

25:12.110 --> 25:14.376
Don't think girls can rate
other girls' arses?

25:14.514 --> 25:16.485
No. That's weird.

25:19.825 --> 25:22.103
Now THAT'S an eight.

25:25.710 --> 25:27.269
Five.

25:27.270 --> 25:28.389
Nah, three.

25:28.390 --> 25:30.349
Seven.

25:30.350 --> 25:32.629
Six.

25:32.630 --> 25:35.789
Nine!

25:35.790 --> 25:37.069
So?

25:37.070 --> 25:38.549
No way!

25:38.550 --> 25:39.869
I won't tell Carl.

25:39.870 --> 25:42.000
I am not rating a guy's arse.

25:45.270 --> 25:46.989
Four.

25:46.990 --> 25:49.062
Fuck off! He's barely a three!

26:03.422 --> 26:07.421
Fuck!

26:08.670 --> 26:12.589
Fucking hell!

26:12.590 --> 26:16.229
Two years and I ended it with him.

26:16.230 --> 26:17.291
Why?

26:17.338 --> 26:18.629
I caught him.

26:18.630 --> 26:19.749
Cheating?

26:19.750 --> 26:21.299
Not exactly.

26:23.670 --> 26:25.590
You and Carl have
got no chance, he's

26:25.591 --> 26:27.509
practically in training
for the Olympics.

26:27.510 --> 26:31.509
Yeah, it wasn't so much the deed
itself, more the visual aid.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.349
"Pedigree Pets."

26:34.350 --> 26:35.989
What dog was...

26:35.990 --> 26:36.989
German Shepherd.

26:36.990 --> 26:38.189
Fucking hell!

26:38.190 --> 26:42.189
They're not even that fit.

26:42.790 --> 26:46.789
There!

26:48.310 --> 26:50.111
You know what?

26:55.310 --> 26:58.549
I remember.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.709
She was black.

26:59.710 --> 27:03.709
It's not funny any more, Dominic.

27:05.709 --> 27:09.708
I laid awake last night worrying
that nutter was coming back.

27:10.030 --> 27:11.589
And you have done nothing

27:11.590 --> 27:14.534
to try and find out who it was
you were actually with.

27:14.582 --> 27:16.061
I've narrowed it down.

27:16.172 --> 27:18.371
I've already crossed off Ginger Pete.

27:18.403 --> 27:19.602
What is wrong with you?

27:19.830 --> 27:21.829
Does nothing ever bother you?

27:21.830 --> 27:25.189
You flit about like there's never
going to be any consequences,

27:25.190 --> 27:27.784
like it's all
just going to work out

27:27.885 --> 27:29.189
It usually does.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.709
No it doesn't!

27:31.710 --> 27:33.389
You just wind up back here

27:33.390 --> 27:35.829
and muggins has to drag you
out of the fire.

27:35.830 --> 27:37.291
So maybe you should stop.

27:41.729 --> 27:43.589
This is my home, Dominic.

27:43.590 --> 27:47.589
And I'm tired of taking the punches
cos you won't.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.299
All right.

27:52.230 --> 27:53.955
I'm sorry, Sis.

28:04.121 --> 28:07.240
Listen, about the plan,
we have to make sure...

28:07.390 --> 28:08.965
Way ahead of you.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.589
What's this?

28:13.590 --> 28:15.869
This stuff's going to be a lot
bigger than cigarettes.

28:15.870 --> 28:18.389
OK, here's what we do.

28:18.390 --> 28:20.989
In and out, ten minutes tops.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.989
That's the roof, there.
Those are the cages.

28:23.990 --> 28:26.909
Head over to them, fill your bags
with as much as you can,

28:26.910 --> 28:29.069
bring 'em back here.

28:29.070 --> 28:31.349
Then I'll pull them up,
unload them here

28:31.350 --> 28:33.223
and pass the bags back down again.

28:33.471 --> 28:34.816
Easy.

28:36.870 --> 28:38.109
You drew this?

28:38.110 --> 28:39.785
Yeah.

28:42.870 --> 28:44.469
And, that's me, is it, there?

28:44.470 --> 28:45.909
Yeah.

28:45.910 --> 28:47.549
Why am I so small?

28:47.550 --> 28:48.909
It's not to scale, Shane.

28:48.910 --> 28:51.269
But that's you, is it?

28:51.270 --> 28:54.909
Up there, taking it easy whilst
I run around like a little pack-mule?

28:54.910 --> 28:56.229
I came up with the plan.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.779
The plan?
You drew a fucking picture.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.530
That suddenly make you
brains of the operation now?

29:02.350 --> 29:03.770
Yeah.

29:03.859 --> 29:06.177
That's right. I am.

29:18.312 --> 29:19.702
Very mature.

29:28.707 --> 29:30.850
Admit it. You had fun.

29:32.117 --> 29:35.356
Well, I did.
We should do it again some time.

29:35.443 --> 29:39.322
Maybe invite Carl? He doesn't get
to mess about much any more.

29:39.550 --> 29:41.444
Well, he gets everything else.

29:46.150 --> 29:49.014
It wouldn't have mattered who
he was moving in with, would it?

29:49.496 --> 29:54.240
You just don't like the idea of him
getting on with his life.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.509
What're you on about?

29:55.510 --> 29:59.509
Jesus, what was the point of any of
this? What do I have to do?

30:00.432 --> 30:04.431
I am not going to be one of those
girls that comes between mates.

30:04.791 --> 30:07.110
So do you wanna shag me, or what?

30:07.190 --> 30:10.548
Will that do it...
even things up a bit?

30:10.579 --> 30:12.119
What d'you mean?

30:12.414 --> 30:16.413
I'll give you a hand job right now.
If that's what it takes.

30:21.390 --> 30:24.015
Frank, what you doing?

30:28.790 --> 30:31.629
What you doing?

30:31.630 --> 30:32.989
What's that?

30:32.990 --> 30:35.264
An Albanian snow leopard.

30:35.452 --> 30:36.589
It's a terrapin.

30:36.590 --> 30:38.366
Why bother asking, then?

30:42.350 --> 30:44.324
Whatever it is, he's dying.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.285
It's not a tortoise, it needs water.

30:56.496 --> 30:58.309
There you go, Terry.

30:58.310 --> 30:59.869
Terry?

30:59.870 --> 31:01.582
It's his name.

31:09.350 --> 31:12.504
So how did your great experiment go?
Manage to win him over?

31:13.430 --> 31:15.347
She has her moments.

31:15.465 --> 31:17.864
Anything you can't do?

31:18.170 --> 31:20.769
Water-skiing.
But I'll get there.

31:20.950 --> 31:22.644
By the way,

31:22.683 --> 31:27.252
offered him a no-strings shag
and he said no, loyal mate this one.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.273
Naw, he just couldn't get it up,
could he?

31:34.470 --> 31:35.029
Fuck off!

31:35.030 --> 31:38.149
Hug it out!

31:38.150 --> 31:42.149
Yeah, that's probably not
gonna happen is it?!

31:45.590 --> 31:47.069
So you really offered him a shag?

31:47.070 --> 31:48.589
Yep.

31:48.590 --> 31:52.589
And he really said no?

31:59.532 --> 32:00.771
Go.

32:01.710 --> 32:05.709
And remember the deal,
two loads and then we swap.

32:16.822 --> 32:18.701
Get down here.

32:18.827 --> 32:22.546
Pulling a plastic bag over
barbed wire, fucking genius,

32:22.790 --> 32:23.549
well done, mate

32:23.550 --> 32:26.989
And this is your plan, is it?
You're the brains now, are you?

32:26.990 --> 32:28.629
And the brawn.

32:28.630 --> 32:29.949
That's debatable.

32:29.950 --> 32:31.629
Yeah? You wanna have a fucking
go, do yer?

32:31.630 --> 32:34.269
Maybe I do, yeah.

32:34.270 --> 32:37.629
Come on, then!

32:37.630 --> 32:39.789
It's not what it looks like.

32:39.790 --> 32:41.149
Brilliant. That should fool him

32:41.150 --> 32:42.645
You think you can do better.

32:42.691 --> 32:43.606
Yeah, I could.

32:43.665 --> 32:45.121
Be my fuckin' guest.

32:46.510 --> 32:49.949
How much, mate? To turn a blind eye?

32:49.950 --> 32:51.709
Twenty quid?

32:51.710 --> 32:53.349
You do know that stuff's
out of date?

32:53.350 --> 32:56.269
And you want to pay me
to let you nick out-of-date food?

32:56.270 --> 32:58.029
Apparently.

32:58.030 --> 32:59.629
Fuck it.

32:59.630 --> 33:00.869
Make it 25 and I'll help you
load it up myself.

33:00.870 --> 33:04.869
Done!

33:22.474 --> 33:25.793
You're off, then, are you?

33:25.990 --> 33:30.239
New life... moving in with your
little sympathy...vote girlfriend?

33:30.299 --> 33:31.567
Watch your mouth.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.301
Fair do's.

33:39.598 --> 33:42.624
Don't forget Father's Day.

33:49.536 --> 33:52.155
That's it?

33:54.270 --> 33:55.639
It would appear so.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.397
You really are a cunt,
you know that?

34:00.410 --> 34:04.409
90% perspiration, son... the more
I practise, the luckier I get.

34:12.030 --> 34:14.030
If you're looking to
cash-in your inheritance,

34:14.031 --> 34:16.029
I've invested it on your behalf.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.429
I'm just glad to kick the dust
of this shit-hole off my shoes.

34:19.429 --> 34:23.429
We're glad to see the back of you.

34:24.123 --> 34:28.121
I'm ashamed of you,
you know that... always have been.

34:29.110 --> 34:33.109
You're the one ride I always wished
I'd worn a Johnny for.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.143
Two, for safety.

34:39.641 --> 34:41.634
I really fucking hate you.

34:44.510 --> 34:45.909
I know.

34:48.577 --> 34:50.120
Likewise.

35:00.830 --> 35:02.221
You cunt.

35:02.291 --> 35:03.683
You ball-bag.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.916
Mondays and Thursdays
before the staff get in.

36:22.640 --> 36:27.291
Two schools, two shelters,
and three old farts' homes.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.719
You know what we've got here,
don't you?

36:29.720 --> 36:31.519
What?

36:31.520 --> 36:35.519
A fucking business.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.799
What you doing?!

36:41.800 --> 36:43.479
Terry?!

36:43.480 --> 36:45.799
What in God's name
is wrong with you now?

36:45.800 --> 36:47.599
Where is he? What have you done?

36:47.600 --> 36:49.159
Terry?

36:49.160 --> 36:50.079
Who's Terry?

36:50.080 --> 36:52.719
He's my fucking terrapin,
who else would he be?

36:52.720 --> 36:56.719
What?

36:56.880 --> 37:00.879
Where is he?! What have you done?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.399
Terry! Where is he?

37:07.400 --> 37:10.039
You've killed him!

37:10.040 --> 37:12.719
We were the same, him and me.
All alone in the world,

37:12.720 --> 37:16.719
dumped in the gutter,
loved ones gone forever.

37:17.221 --> 37:20.660
Admittedly, in his case,
cos I'd stood on them all but...

37:25.880 --> 37:29.519
There he is! Hey!

37:29.520 --> 37:33.399
He went home!

37:33.400 --> 37:37.279
He wet his head and crawled home.
What did I tell you?

37:37.280 --> 37:41.279
He's just like me.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.639
Rent's on Friday, keep
the noise down and if you ever bring

37:59.640 --> 38:03.639
any women back make sure she's
got a friend for me, yeah?

38:12.200 --> 38:14.007
Good news!

38:14.401 --> 38:15.960
Yeah?

38:16.711 --> 38:19.914
I talked to Ryan. We're through.

38:21.572 --> 38:23.125
So, I'm moving in.

38:31.192 --> 38:36.078
Be nice living in a shop...
Can I have this?

38:37.840 --> 38:38.919
Yeah.

38:39.139 --> 38:41.461
I'll bring my stuff round later
this afternoon, yeah?

38:51.320 --> 38:53.164
Wanna make it official?

38:56.814 --> 38:59.493
It's gonna be nice walking in
there, money for the kitty,

38:59.697 --> 39:01.492
not feeling like such a loser.

39:02.044 --> 39:04.763
Last few weeks been hard,
haven't felt like a man,

39:04.813 --> 39:06.199
me and her have hardly even fu...

39:06.200 --> 39:10.199
Woah, woah, woah, woah!
What the fuck are you doing?

39:10.520 --> 39:13.639
Caring and sharing?
We're business partners.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.239
This is not a fucking
self-help group.

39:17.294 --> 39:21.293
Plus I still owe you a slap.
Now piss off.

39:26.297 --> 39:30.820
Jackson?
Give her one from me though?

39:31.266 --> 39:33.500
You are the brawn after all.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.959
Yeah, and the brains.
So what does that make you?

39:35.960 --> 39:39.959
The good-looking one?

40:23.629 --> 40:25.636
Ches?

40:27.480 --> 40:28.972
Chesney?

40:42.000 --> 40:45.039
Yesss!

40:45.040 --> 40:49.039
Ches?

40:53.769 --> 40:56.048
Karen'll go mental.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.479
You know the rules...
nothing with four legs

40:58.480 --> 41:00.846
unless it's got a blind person
attached to it.

41:02.579 --> 41:05.858
Perhaps you'd think about staying
somewhere else... just for a bit?

41:06.320 --> 41:09.599
I think witness relocation's
a bit strong, don't you?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.879
Look, I've done nothing wrong,
well, legally.

41:11.880 --> 41:12.639
Look, I'll just...

41:12.640 --> 41:15.879
Don't say it'll work out,
please, Dominic.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.119
Fella's been asking after you
last couple of days...

41:18.120 --> 41:20.399
Let us know
when he's in again, yeah?

41:20.400 --> 41:24.239
He's in now.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.479
It's all right, I'll just,
I'll have a nice word,

41:27.480 --> 41:29.159
you know, straighten it out.

41:29.160 --> 41:33.159
Do you really ever?

42:04.760 --> 42:07.799
I remember now,
there was two of them.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.799
And the black girl,
she had red hair, which

42:09.800 --> 42:13.799
I thought was pretty strange
when you come to think about it.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.759
This'll be that consequence
you've been banging on about?

42:23.800 --> 42:27.799
I guess that's what it is.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.799
I want a fucking word with you.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.799
Gentlemen, please.

42:38.880 --> 42:42.879
Don't. He fucked their wives...
both of them... at once.

42:43.360 --> 42:47.359
Isn't he a priest?

42:47.680 --> 42:49.559
For what it's worth,
they're lovely girls.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.559
Get up!

43:18.120 --> 43:20.599
What the fuck is that thing?!

43:20.600 --> 43:23.079
His name is Terry.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.599
There, that'll do.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.599
Cheers.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.039
You're welcome.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.879
Wake up call?

43:31.880 --> 43:34.839
I need a drink. Now!

43:34.840 --> 43:38.839
Why don't you let me
get you one?

43:38.920 --> 43:40.399
OK.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.959
Glores, sub us a tenner, yeah?

43:43.960 --> 43:47.279
Mum? Mum?!

43:47.280 --> 43:51.279
If you're gonna
borrow my tights at least...

43:52.920 --> 43:55.399
Actually that was me.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.319
God, I don't want to know...

43:57.320 --> 43:59.319
Just give me some money
and I'm out for the day.

43:59.320 --> 44:03.319
Kitchen.

44:10.920 --> 44:14.759
We're going out too.
I'm buying you dinner.

44:14.760 --> 44:18.759
'Flush are we?'

44:19.960 --> 44:23.959
Now, please, can I have a pint?

44:24.040 --> 44:28.039
Of course.

44:37.120 --> 44:41.119
Come on,
you know I'm good for it.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.599
'I don't know.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.879
'Maybe Robin Hood kind of had
the right idea,

44:47.880 --> 44:50.799
'just didn't have very good
business sense, that's all.

44:50.800 --> 44:54.399
'Cos the thing about the poor is,
they'll always find money

44:54.400 --> 44:57.799
'if they need it,
for the necessities and that.

44:57.800 --> 45:01.799
'You see that's why you never see
a sober homeless.

45:04.640 --> 45:07.799
'Steal from the rich, sell to
the rich and let them mark it up

45:07.800 --> 45:11.799
'for the poor. Now that should
have been his thing, the daft twat.

45:11.800 --> 45:14.559
'You see I've always liked
being at rock bottom.

45:14.560 --> 45:18.199
'Then any little victory you can
muster tastes so much sweeter.

45:18.200 --> 45:22.980
'One little gamble and suddenly...
everything is coming up roses.'

45:23.160 --> 45:24.879
I think you're bored, Karen.

45:24.880 --> 45:27.679
I reckon I could have that girl
flat on her back any time I like.

45:27.680 --> 45:28.999
15 years ago, maybe.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.999
I think you've made a mistake.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.119
The drink is taking its toll.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.479
And the drugs.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.559
And you know you have to be careful.

45:35.560 --> 45:39.559
He bet he could get you into bed
and if he does he wins... me.

45:39.640 --> 45:40.519
You've saved someone's life
today, you know.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.719
You saved one life.

45:41.720 --> 45:45.479
But you're not suddenly a superhero.
You can't save everybody.

45:45.480 --> 45:47.039
I am going to fuck you rather
spectacularly, Dom.

45:47.040 --> 45:51.039
OK.
