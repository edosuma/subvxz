00:11.867 --> 00:13.600
Narrator:
Coming up, why is Murr

00:13.600 --> 00:15.200
getting something off his chest?

00:15.200 --> 00:17.400
My nipples are so hard
under this apron.

00:18.633 --> 00:21.067
Why is Joe
getting jockey with it?

00:21.067 --> 00:23.100
I was drying it out.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.400
And which losing joker

00:24.400 --> 00:27.333
will have daddy issues
in tonight's punishment?

00:28.967 --> 00:32.133
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.200
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:34.900 --> 00:36.533
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:38.333 --> 00:41.067
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:41.067 --> 00:43.100
Joe: Larry!

00:47.433 --> 00:48.867
Today, we're here
at Food Bazaar

00:48.867 --> 00:50.767
putting sticky notes
on unsuspecting shoppers.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.367
We're competing
head to head,

00:52.367 --> 00:54.433
joker versus joker,
note for note.

00:54.433 --> 00:57.167
The last person to attach a note
without getting caught

00:57.167 --> 01:00.300
before a shopper leaves
the playing area wins.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.833
Ready to do it?

01:03.833 --> 01:06.800
**

01:06.800 --> 01:09.133
Murr: All right, from the makers
of the balloon challenge

01:09.133 --> 01:11.133
comes the
Post-it Note challenge.

01:11.133 --> 01:12.433
You guys choose a target.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.433
When they enter the playing
field, the game is on.

01:14.433 --> 01:16.533
Whoever gets the most
sticky notes on their back

01:16.533 --> 01:17.900
without getting caught
wins.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.300
Okay.
Best two out of three.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.933
**

01:21.933 --> 01:24.300
Q: Oh, look at that!
Sal got one in!

01:24.300 --> 01:26.400
Joe, your turn, buddy.
Your turn.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.800
You know, they have
the solid cheeses,

01:27.800 --> 01:30.333
-but if you want --
-I should get the Parmesan.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.167
Get the Parmesan.

01:32.167 --> 01:34.067
-Simply Orange. You got two.
-I don't know if we should.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.367
-Oh, Joe got one.
-Wow.

01:35.367 --> 01:38.133
Simply Orange
is 3 for $10.

01:38.133 --> 01:39.467
It's all tied up.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.067
Sal: They don't have --
They don't have the...

01:42.067 --> 01:43.867
He's eyeing you guys.

01:43.867 --> 01:47.067
This guy's radar
is pinging right now.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.467
Oh!
Oh! Sal's fell off!

01:49.467 --> 01:51.900
But nobody was caught,
so the game's still on.

01:51.900 --> 01:55.733
Sal: If we get the two yogurts,
we can do it.

01:55.733 --> 01:56.867
Gouda?

01:58.067 --> 02:00.500
You like stickies?
Here.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.933
Play with the stickies.
They stick.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.867
There you go.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.833
Murr: All right.
Now the kid's got it.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.333
The kid's playing with it.
Stickies are fun.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.133
-You gave it to the kid.
-I gave it open,

02:11.133 --> 02:13.167
but the father took it
and stuck it on this kid.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.533
Okay. Wait till
the kid throws it.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.733
That was a genius move.

02:15.733 --> 02:17.067
Why are you not
giving me props for that?

02:17.067 --> 02:18.333
I made a fake list,
and I said,

02:18.333 --> 02:20.067
"Oh, I love these stickies.
You want a sticky?"

02:20.067 --> 02:21.833
Then he stuck it
on his own son.

02:21.833 --> 02:23.433
I used him
as a delivery system.

02:23.433 --> 02:25.200
It was brilliant.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.133
Why you guys --

02:27.133 --> 02:28.867
That's a big-time
move I just did.

02:28.867 --> 02:29.933
No one's impressed.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.567
**

02:31.567 --> 02:34.067
And the kid dropped it,
so

02:34.067 --> 02:36.067
Murr: Oh, he's about
to leave the aisle!

02:36.067 --> 02:37.900
-Oh!
-Oh!

02:37.900 --> 02:39.067
Sal loses.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.167
Bad luck.
The Sal Vulcano way, baby.

02:43.233 --> 02:44.500
Oh, awesome, man.
Thanks.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.900
Oh, this guy's
a fan of the show.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.900
Yeah, I got a piece
of paper right here.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.067
I actually happen
to have a Post-it.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.900
I'll see if I can get
a pen for you.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.433
Troy -- Yeah.
My son's name is Troy.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.800
Troy.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.833
-I'll sign that for you.
-There you go, man.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.633
-Excellent.
-Say hi to him for us, man.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.500
-I appreciate it.
-Thanks. Appreciate it.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.400
Murr: Oh! Sal!

03:12.400 --> 03:13.700
He slipped it on a fan.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.200
Q: That's smart.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.800
Listen, it's a pleasure, man.
It was a pleasure to meet you.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.867
Oh!
Oh! It's tied up!

03:26.233 --> 03:27.500
Sal gets caught!

03:27.500 --> 03:29.467
Joe Gatto steals it!

03:31.633 --> 03:34.467
**

03:34.467 --> 03:36.700
Guys,
good luck out there.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.200
Damn it.
I don't have a jacket.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.467
-No, and my --

03:43.467 --> 03:44.800
Oh, your nipples are gonna
be popping right out.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.400
They're getting it already.
You see this

03:52.800 --> 03:54.067
These are cream cheese?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.733
Dope.

03:56.733 --> 03:58.100
Both: Mmm.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.867
Oh. Oh.
I'm so sorry.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.933
Sal: Oh, here we go.
Joe: Oh, my God.

04:05.933 --> 04:09.067
All right. Whoo.
Almost went down.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.733
-I'm okay, yeah.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.200
You okay, sir?
You all right?

04:12.200 --> 04:14.067
-Wow!
-Oh, oh, oh!

04:20.767 --> 04:22.100
Yeah, no, I'm okay.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.300
Are you guys -- It doesn't
seem like you're okay.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.233
Wow. Murray's got
an answer for every one.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.833
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.500
Thank you. And thank you for
being such a good Samaritan.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.367
Appreciate it.
You all right? All right.

04:33.367 --> 04:36.200
What do you got there?
Bananas?

04:37.667 --> 04:39.867
The bananas -- I think the
bananas are on sale, by the way.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.367
They're like $3.
They're on sale.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.600
No, no, those were on sale
last week. Last week.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.067
-Last week.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.567
He's like a walking desk.
Oh, my God.

04:48.567 --> 04:49.900
They have the circular
over there.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.433
The circular
shows them on sale.
5-5.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.167
10 Post-its
on this man.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.433
Looks like
my old cubicle.

04:54.433 --> 04:55.900
Well, hey,
thanks for the help.

04:55.900 --> 04:59.267
Oh, my God.
6-5. 11 Post-its.

04:59.267 --> 05:00.800
To be honest, that guy
kind of had it coming.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.800
He's tripping on the aisle.
You know? I mean, come on.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.167
13 Post-its. 7-6.

05:10.167 --> 05:11.333
Do you mind
if I grab that?

05:11.333 --> 05:12.700
I'm actually gonna
grab the Starbucks.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.267
14 Post-its.

05:14.267 --> 05:16.433
That one is
the most delicious.

05:16.433 --> 05:17.867
-Oh, sorry, sir.

05:17.867 --> 05:20.100
Sal: Oh! Purple down!

05:21.600 --> 05:24.733
**

05:24.733 --> 05:26.367
Nope, nope.
It's back. It's back.

05:31.367 --> 05:32.900
Sal: And that's it!

05:32.900 --> 05:34.533
Joe: Is he blaming --
Who's he blaming?

05:34.533 --> 05:36.500
Sir, can I ask you
a question?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.900
Who do you think
did that?

05:38.900 --> 05:40.900
That guy?

05:43.933 --> 05:45.100
Worth a bite or not?

05:45.100 --> 05:46.200
These are good.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.667
Like, good, like, good
or like...?

05:47.667 --> 05:49.433
Yeah. I could get you some
if you want.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.367
You're going to eat
one dozen cannolis?

05:53.367 --> 05:55.067
You're not.
You're gonna get sick.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.900
I'm not making you do it,
even for the joke, okay?

05:56.900 --> 05:58.533
I'm your friend.

05:58.533 --> 06:00.267
Joe, stop.

06:00.267 --> 06:02.833
I got them
in a good clip right now.

06:02.833 --> 06:06.333
Joe, holy
Five cannolis.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.467
They got to be at least
150 calories each.

06:08.467 --> 06:11.467
All you do is drink
coffee and pastries.

06:11.467 --> 06:12.733
He just goes glug, glug,

06:12.733 --> 06:15.533
and he's like, "All right!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!"

06:15.533 --> 06:19.100
You also --
You also had a macaroon.

06:21.567 --> 06:24.833
Sal: Oh, you got to be
kidding me. Look at this guy.

06:24.833 --> 06:27.067
What do you think that
this is gonna do for you?

06:27.067 --> 06:30.067
-It's gonna cover his nipples.
-It's gonna cover my nipples.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.467
Joe:
That's all it's doing.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.900
That's all it's doing,
is covering his nipples.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.867
**

06:35.867 --> 06:38.633
Ma'am, we've got a sale on
everything here on the right --

06:38.633 --> 06:40.667
on the left
if you'd like today, okay?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.067
So please help yourself.

06:42.067 --> 06:44.267
And Murray's in,
using credibility

06:44.267 --> 06:46.533
from the apron
that's covering his nipples.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.233
He went high!
He went high!

06:50.233 --> 06:52.567
Oh, my God.
And she has no clue whatsoever.

06:52.567 --> 06:55.167
And I feel like her bun
will help it stay on

06:55.167 --> 06:56.567
if it starts to fall.

06:56.567 --> 06:58.667
I don't know if you saw these.
These are 3 for $10.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.067
Joe: Oh, Q's fell!

07:00.067 --> 07:01.467
Q, this
nipple-covering apron

07:01.467 --> 07:03.400
may prove to be
the death of you.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.500
Is this --
is the cream...?

07:05.500 --> 07:07.900
-Stay over there.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.767
It's a question --
if it's on sale.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.467
It's not on sale, sir.
Cheapo.

07:12.467 --> 07:14.067
-Oh, Murray's up.
-It is his turn.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.833
Sal: Wow!
She's really loading up.

07:16.833 --> 07:19.833
Oh, she's going 3 for $10.
She's doing the 3 for $10 deal.

07:19.833 --> 07:22.233
Great deal here.
3 for $10 on the Tropicana.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.833
By the way,
it's all varieties.

07:23.833 --> 07:26.500
Oh, the bread?

07:26.500 --> 07:29.267
I used to work
in the bakery department.

07:29.267 --> 07:30.633
I used to work right around
the bakery department,

07:30.633 --> 07:32.133
and then they switched me
to the frozen foods,

07:32.133 --> 07:33.733
and now I'm freezing
all day!

07:33.733 --> 07:35.933
My nipples are so hard
under this apron.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.800
Sal: Oh, that's a weird thing
for your grocer to tell you.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.400
I've never had a grocer
talk to me about their nipples.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.667
**

07:43.667 --> 07:45.467
I'm sorry. I think you have
my cart, sweetheart.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.467
-Oh, my God.
-Tied up, tied up.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.433
-He tied it up.
-I forgot. I just came for this.

07:49.433 --> 07:51.767
-Look at this. Look at this!
-All right. Thank you.

07:51.767 --> 07:53.667
She's leaving the aisle. .

07:53.667 --> 07:55.333
Joe: She's getting away.
Hurry up.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.800
Pay attention
to her feet!

07:57.800 --> 08:01.933
The sharks, the sharks.
Circling.

08:01.933 --> 08:04.967
She's gonna step over!

08:04.967 --> 08:07.300
Don't forget about
the other juices on the right.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.967
Oh! He got it! He got it.
His foot was in.

08:08.967 --> 08:11.800
-Wow!

08:11.800 --> 08:13.900
Good work, buddy.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.167
Narrator: Take note --

08:15.167 --> 08:18.600
Q and Sal are stuck
on the loser board.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.167
Today, we're working as
field reporters in the park,

08:21.167 --> 08:23.800
only we've arrived too late
and completely missed

08:23.800 --> 08:25.433
the incident
we're supposed to cover.

08:25.433 --> 08:26.600
What's a reporter to do?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.667
We're going to have to
convince a stranger

08:28.667 --> 08:30.767
to repeat a crazy quote
into this recorder.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.567
The catch is that
these ridiculous quotes

08:32.567 --> 08:34.167
have been made up
by the other guys.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.533
If you can't get the stranger
to recite the quote, you lose.

08:36.533 --> 08:38.867
Let's take minute and just
reflect on what's going on here.

08:38.867 --> 08:40.700
What?! James Murray,
ace reporter!

08:40.700 --> 08:42.467
-Oh, my God.

08:42.467 --> 08:46.433
Narrator:
It's a Double Down challenge.

08:46.433 --> 08:48.967
What time is it?
Time for a quote.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.767
Where in the hell
am I gonna get this quote?

08:51.767 --> 08:54.567
Guys, did you just come from
over at that end of the park?

08:54.567 --> 08:56.067
Yeah.
I'm a reporter with
the Staten Island Bugle.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.067
I'm supposed to get
a quote on a story.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.300
They're already gone?
Damn it.

08:59.300 --> 09:03.933
The story was that there
was a man dressed as a ghost

09:03.933 --> 09:05.733
and he defecated himself.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.200
-Oh, I missed it!

09:07.200 --> 09:08.733
I'm supposed to get a quote
for the article I got to right.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.067
Can one of you guys
help me out?

09:15.967 --> 09:17.933
Can one of you guys
just give me the quote?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.300
I can run right back,
finish the article,

09:19.300 --> 09:21.833
and get it printed,
and I won't lose my damn job.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.100
Some would call him
a freak,

09:23.100 --> 09:25.367
but that dude was
the
Yeah!

09:25.367 --> 09:27.067
-No, no!
-"Sheet."

09:27.067 --> 09:29.833
Sheet, sheet, sheet.
It's a pun.

09:29.833 --> 09:32.500
Some would call him a freak,
but that dude was da sheet.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.433
Yes. Thanks, man. Yes!

09:35.767 --> 09:37.533
The glasses and the tweed
jacket does it every time.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.400
Q: It's the outfit.
It's the outfit.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.467
Oh, man. Is it over?

09:43.467 --> 09:45.133
Boys, bad news --
I missed the whole thing.

09:45.133 --> 09:47.133
Murr: You did?

09:47.133 --> 09:49.267
Hi, hon. I'm with the press.
I don't know if you heard --

09:49.267 --> 09:51.967
a woman gave birth to twins
without any assistance.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.633
Actually, yeah, right up there.
I already wrote the quote.

09:53.633 --> 09:55.567
It's super easy.
I just need somebody to say...

10:00.433 --> 10:03.400
That's the quote I wrote.
No? Well, no --

10:04.933 --> 10:07.433
No
Because I got a deadline.

10:07.433 --> 10:08.767
I got a deadline.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.333
**

10:12.333 --> 10:13.633
Excuse me, ladies.

10:13.633 --> 10:14.933
I'm trying to get a quote
for an article

10:14.933 --> 10:16.300
for the Staten Island
Retreat newspaper.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.167
Would you guys mind
two seconds?

10:18.167 --> 10:20.333
It would really
help me out.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.167
But you said that
in English.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.733
What happened was, uh,

10:24.733 --> 10:26.933
there was an oil spill
right off New York today.

10:26.933 --> 10:29.033
And I just need
someone to say...

10:33.633 --> 10:35.200
That black stuff
be sticky.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.933
-Oh!
-Oh, man!

10:37.933 --> 10:41.600
Are you here visiting
a boyfriend or...?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.333
You know,
I had escargot once.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.533
-All right, Sal.
-Excuse me, ma'am.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.733
Did you see the flower
planting ceremony

10:50.733 --> 10:51.967
by the city here today?

10:51.967 --> 10:54.633
I'm just looking to get
a quote for the paper.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.433
Um, the city's
gonna be planting

10:56.433 --> 10:58.667
all new flowers
in the park.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.067
I also wrote the article out,
and I have a quote here

11:01.067 --> 11:02.533
that would work great
for that article.

11:02.533 --> 11:04.400
I was wondering
if you could say...

11:14.100 --> 11:15.833
All right, Sal,
we like this one a lot,

11:15.833 --> 11:17.967
so we're gonna give you
another shot at it, buddy.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.533
Go ahead.
Oh, God.

11:19.533 --> 11:21.067
In fact, Sal,
you can't stop

11:21.067 --> 11:23.700
until someone gives you
that quote, buddy.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.200
Excuse me, miss.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.067
In regards to the flowers
being planted,

11:27.067 --> 11:29.133
would you be willing
to say this quote here?

11:29.133 --> 11:30.400
"I voted for cactus,

11:30.400 --> 11:33.400
but nobody cares
what this old lesbian thinks."

11:33.400 --> 11:34.967
Oh, okay.

11:34.967 --> 11:37.400
you guys.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.967
"I voted for cactuses,

11:39.967 --> 11:42.200
but nobody cares
what this old lesbian thinks."

11:42.200 --> 11:43.700
So I was wondering
if you could just say --

11:43.700 --> 11:45.800
if you could quote that, and
I can just put it in the paper.

11:47.933 --> 11:50.567
I wanted someone to say,
"I voted for cactus,

11:50.567 --> 11:53.700
but nobody cares what
this old lesbian thinks."

11:53.700 --> 11:56.633
I voted for cactus...

11:56.633 --> 11:59.067
but nobody cares what
this old lesbian thinks."

11:59.067 --> 12:00.467
Thank you so much.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.467
-Oh, my God.
-Wow.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.067
Have a great day.

12:06.433 --> 12:07.933
Narrator:
Joe missed his deadline,

12:07.933 --> 12:11.567
so he's doing double time
on the loser board.

12:11.567 --> 12:13.333
It's a Joker vs. Joker
challenge,

12:13.333 --> 12:14.600
and today, Joe and Q

12:14.600 --> 12:16.433
are facing off
as financial planners.

12:16.433 --> 12:17.800
While meeting
with prospective clients,

12:17.800 --> 12:19.400
we'll have to do and say
what the other guys tell us.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.767
At the end,
we'll ask them to rate

12:20.767 --> 12:22.967
how likely they are to come
back for another meeting.

12:22.967 --> 12:25.700
Whoever gets
the lowest score loses.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.500
**

12:28.500 --> 12:31.533
How you doing? Samuel.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.900
Good. Brian. Hey. How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.933
All right, so you know
what we're doing here, Samuel?

12:35.933 --> 12:37.100
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.333
What are you interested
in learning about?

12:38.333 --> 12:40.067
Is there any specific area

12:40.067 --> 12:42.367
that you're interested
in learning about?

12:42.367 --> 12:43.867
Yeah, um, I actually have
a couple questions.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.433
Joe: Stop right there.
Let me tell you about me.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.767
All right, let me tell you
about me, though.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.067
Okay.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.500
I've been doing
this for 10 years.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.933
I've been doing this
for 10 years.

12:50.933 --> 12:52.200
Okay.
Matter of fact...

12:52.200 --> 12:54.100
You know,
matter of fact...

12:54.100 --> 12:56.133
...I just made $27.

12:56.133 --> 12:58.233
...I just made $27.
Oh, nice.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.833
$27 every 10 seconds.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.900
Every 10 seconds,
on average,

13:01.900 --> 13:05.667
my portfolio...
$27.

13:05.667 --> 13:09.800
Now I have $54.
Nice.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.500
So, you got a savings
account and ?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.767
Oh, I got him!

13:15.767 --> 13:17.133
Murr: He can't do it!

13:17.133 --> 13:19.667
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

13:19.667 --> 13:22.300
I have a book
over here.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.533
There's nothing
back there, bud. Ask him.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.633
So, do you have a savings
account and ?

13:27.633 --> 13:28.667
I do.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.467
You do. Okay. Yes.

13:32.467 --> 13:33.633
Do you have a will?

13:33.633 --> 13:34.933
Do you have a will?

13:34.933 --> 13:36.267
I don't have a will.
You don't have a will?

13:36.267 --> 13:38.333
No.
Everyone should
have a will.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.700
I'm actually leaving
everything in my will

13:39.700 --> 13:41.100
to my high-school crush.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.767
Like, I have a will.
I'm actually leaving everything

13:42.767 --> 13:45.767
in my will
to my high-school crush.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.667
Oh, my goodness.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.667
Hopefully, she'll realize
I'm a nice guy.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.200
The idea being, like,

13:51.200 --> 13:52.900
she'll realize
that I'm a nice guy.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.733
And then we can go
on a date in heaven.

13:54.733 --> 13:57.300
And when she gets to heaven,
we could date.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.733
You know what I'm saying?
Right, right.

13:58.733 --> 14:00.867
It's a big sticking point
with my wife.

14:00.867 --> 14:02.467
Right, right.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.733
All right.
Let's see how you did.

14:03.733 --> 14:05.200
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how likely are you

14:05.200 --> 14:07.633
to have another
meeting with me?

14:07.633 --> 14:09.067
-Like 8.

14:09.067 --> 14:10.933
!
Oh!

14:10.933 --> 14:12.600
You're gonna make
a  load of money.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.567
I hope so.
Let's do it.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.133
Great. Joe.
Have a seat, pal.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.500
All right, Ray,
so, I'll give you

14:20.500 --> 14:21.900
an overview of basically
how it is,

14:21.900 --> 14:23.467
this financial plan
that's right for you.

14:23.467 --> 14:24.933
Keep saying
"shtock market."

14:24.933 --> 14:27.067
Shtock, shtock.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.500
We talk a lot about
the shtock market,

14:28.500 --> 14:29.900
shtocks in general.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.767
I don't know
if you own any shtocks,

14:31.767 --> 14:33.467
dividends,
bonds, shtocks.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.900
We talk about all that.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.633
You want to probably
try to keep down the amount

14:37.633 --> 14:40.300
of credit-card debt
you're in.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.600
Very smart.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.900
You want a negative balance
on all your credit cards.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.067
You want a negative balance on
all your credit cards, actually.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.867
I always send in extra money
every month.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.233
I always send in
extra money.

14:49.233 --> 14:50.867
When people ask me
about my credit score...

14:50.867 --> 14:52.900
So that when somebody asks me
about my credit score...

14:52.900 --> 14:55.967
...I tell them those bitches
owe me money, son.

14:55.967 --> 14:58.567
...I'm like, "Those bitches
owe me money, son."

15:00.800 --> 15:02.067
What do you do now?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.567
Security guard.
Security guard. Great.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.333
Turn around and look at
the shelf behind you, bud.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.800
I had a book back here
that -- Oh.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.233
Q: It's a wet jock strap
drying behind his head.

15:11.233 --> 15:14.533
You're here
for financial planning.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.167
Sorry, I accidentally
left my jock strap out.

15:16.167 --> 15:18.633
-I was drying the sweat out.
-I was drying it out.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.667
Murr:
Put it on the desk.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.167
Ah.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.667
Talk to me about your
retirement a little bit.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.067
Paint me a picture
of what you think your
retirement would be like.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.400
-I think to enjoy life.
-Now close your eyes.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.233
Nice, warm, like Florida maybe,
in the Caribbean or something?

15:35.233 --> 15:36.533
Yeah, yeah,
margarita in your hand.

15:36.533 --> 15:37.867
Sal: Get carried away.
No shirt on,

15:37.867 --> 15:39.600
just taking in
those sun rays.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.467
It's nice.
That's it, baby.

15:41.467 --> 15:44.567
Maybe you're in a hammock.
Fresh coconut.

15:44.567 --> 15:46.067
Sal: Maybe I'm rubbing
some lotion on you.

15:46.067 --> 15:47.933
Maybe, you know, I'm rubbing
some lotion on you.

15:47.933 --> 15:52.067
No, I'm sorry. I got caught up.
I got caught up. I'm kidding.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.633
On a scale of 1 to 10,

15:53.633 --> 15:56.300
how likely would you be to
have another meeting with me?

15:56.300 --> 15:58.067
I would say about an 8.
An 8? That high. Great.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.700
-8.
-It's a dead tie.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.933
Wow, buddy!
Shtocks.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.067
Narrator: Both Q and Joe
had their finances in order,

16:06.067 --> 16:09.367
but Joe is still
tonight's big loser.

16:09.367 --> 16:10.600
Joe lost, so today,

16:10.600 --> 16:12.900
we're here at Twinkle
Playspace for kids.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.433
That's right. And you know
what parents love?

16:14.433 --> 16:17.233
They love when other parents
try to do their job for them.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.567
Yeah, and, Joe, you're
the only parent amongst us.

16:19.567 --> 16:20.967
And you're always
talking about,

16:20.967 --> 16:23.333
"I'm a parent, I'm a parent,
I'm a parent."

16:23.333 --> 16:25.433
So get in there and parent
other people's kids.

16:25.433 --> 16:27.167
These are
my three children.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.567
Sal: This is a play space
for kids and their parents.

16:31.567 --> 16:34.167
Parents that bring their kids
here are good parents.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.867
Joe doesn't think so.

16:35.867 --> 16:37.333
Sal: Ooh.
Is that woman texting?

16:37.333 --> 16:39.567
You can't keep your eyes on your
kids when you're texting, Joe.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.067
That's right.

16:43.433 --> 16:46.567
Texting and watching a child
at the same time.

16:46.567 --> 16:49.200
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

16:49.200 --> 16:50.833
I just do it.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.400
Alexia!

16:52.400 --> 16:56.133
I have no idea
where she is, by the way.

16:56.133 --> 16:58.133
Yeah, it's easy
to keep --

16:58.133 --> 17:01.067
It's hard to keep track
of them sometimes

17:01.067 --> 17:02.800
when they're running around
'cause it's a big space.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.067
Q: Say the line.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.500
Easier when you're,
you know --

17:05.500 --> 17:08.367
Easier when
you're not texting.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.900
It's definitely easier
when you're not texting
to keep an eye on them.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.300
Alexia!

17:12.300 --> 17:14.200
Alexia?
Alexia!

17:16.100 --> 17:19.833
Oh, what was that --
Parent was on that slide.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.300
It's for children.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.967
Sal: Ah, the look!

17:28.067 --> 17:30.867
Oh. Pacifiers
and trampolines don't mix.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.700
Pacifier and trampoline
makes me nervous.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.600
I don't want to see that
beautiful face get busted up.

17:38.067 --> 17:40.233
**

17:40.233 --> 17:41.733
Sal:
Get this woman right here.

17:41.733 --> 17:44.600
What percentage of parents
you think are good parents?

17:44.600 --> 17:45.800
Let me ask you
something.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.200
Being here,
what percentage of parents

17:47.200 --> 17:50.867
do you think
are good parents?

17:50.867 --> 17:52.700
You know, what I did?
I put a chip in my son

17:52.700 --> 17:54.400
so I know where he is
at all times.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.800
I put a chip
inside my child

17:55.800 --> 17:58.067
to know where he is
at all times.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.467
It's a kid tracker.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.800
No, but it's also -- They do
wonderful things. It's Wi-Fi.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.767
It's Wi-Fi enabled,
so it makes him

18:03.767 --> 18:06.233
very popular at the playgrounds
'cause he's a Wi-Fi hotspot.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.567
I can stream music
and movies through him.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.800
I can also stream
all my movies and music.

18:12.067 --> 18:14.533
If you want to use it,
the password's "sugartits."

18:16.967 --> 18:18.833
You have to say it.
You have to say it.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.200
You were on the phone before.
If you want to connect

18:21.200 --> 18:23.533
to my son's Wi-Fi,
the password's "sugartits."

18:27.767 --> 18:30.100
Oh, my God.
This is  miserable.

18:32.433 --> 18:33.667
Nice!

18:33.667 --> 18:36.333
Say, "I think
he might have deuced."

18:36.333 --> 18:37.833
I think this one deuced.

18:37.833 --> 18:41.267
I thought it was him.
One of these two deuced.

18:41.267 --> 18:44.767
I think one of the
two of them deuced.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.367
Somebody. Somebody.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.733
Somebody deuced.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.167
Sal: Just say
to another parent,

18:56.167 --> 18:59.333
"Looks like I'm striking out
all over the place here today."

18:59.333 --> 19:01.900
Been striking out here
all day.

19:10.267 --> 19:12.767
Murr: Ooh, Joe, looks like
someone else is on their phone.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
Got to make sure
you're paying attention

19:18.400 --> 19:19.900
to what happens out there

19:19.900 --> 19:24.167
'cause you look down once --
it's like texting and driving.

19:24.167 --> 19:26.533
Are you just a nanny?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.667
Are you just
a guardian or...?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.067
Oh, he's your son.

19:30.067 --> 19:32.767
I've seen nannies text.
Never seen a parent.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.700
I know, 'cause sometimes
I see nannies text.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.833
Never seen really
a parent do it.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.133
Hi!

19:46.133 --> 19:47.400
Sal: Go to the kid.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.267
"Did you get hurt
while Mommy was texting?"

19:57.167 --> 19:59.867
Did he get hurt when Mommy was
texting

20:04.267 --> 20:07.467
Sal: She walked away.

20:11.167 --> 20:13.900
**

20:20.567 --> 20:22.800
Joe Gatto just got
punished here at Twinkle.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.367
But it wasn't child's play
putting this thing together.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.067
You're gonna find out
how it went down.

20:27.067 --> 20:29.400
And you get bonus content
from tonight's episode.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.767
Check it out.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.400
So, this punishment
is so massive,

20:32.400 --> 20:34.300
it's taking up
two separate residences.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.167
Follow me.

20:37.167 --> 20:38.633
Excuse me.

20:38.633 --> 20:42.633
**

20:42.633 --> 20:45.300
And here's the BTS.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.600
I'm here with Brian --

20:46.600 --> 20:47.867
Aaah! The hell!

20:50.333 --> 20:53.900
You can't just sneak up
on someone like that.

20:53.900 --> 20:56.233
Whew!

20:56.233 --> 20:58.533
I'm here
with Brian "Q" Quinn,

20:58.533 --> 21:01.567
and he's signing
some autographs for fans.

21:01.567 --> 21:02.800
Q, tell me.
Yeah, buddy.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.833
What's the impetus
for this punishment?

21:04.833 --> 21:07.167
Why do you think
this is gonna get Joe?

21:07.167 --> 21:09.233
Uh, 'cause Joe's a parent.
Yeah.

21:09.233 --> 21:11.267
And Joe
is very sensitive

21:11.267 --> 21:13.833
to the, you know,
temperament of parents.

21:13.833 --> 21:16.167
Go get that one.

21:16.167 --> 21:17.933
Bud, you dropped one more.

21:17.933 --> 21:19.433
An adult's talking to you.

21:21.667 --> 21:25.167
Special soup delivery for Murr.

21:30.367 --> 21:31.833
Special soup delivery
for Murr.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.167
This is soup number three
of the day.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.533
Is that right?

21:35.533 --> 21:37.800
Yes.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.267
Joe's about to find out
what he has to do.

21:40.267 --> 21:43.067
So, this  hole lost.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.467
So, today, we're here at
Twinkle Playspace for kids

21:45.467 --> 21:46.700
for his punishment.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.067
Joe Gatto, you just
put your earpiece in?

21:48.067 --> 21:49.933
I put my earpiece in.
I got my bottle of water.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.133
I'm ready
to go be punished.

21:51.133 --> 21:52.933
-This is a fake coffee.

21:52.933 --> 21:54.600
-It's a microphone.
-It's a microphone.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.167
So, the earpiece is gonna be
telling you everything

21:56.167 --> 21:57.900
you have to parent today.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.233
Yeah. Didn't you
watch the intro?

21:59.233 --> 22:00.933
-I did watch the intro.
-They already saw all this.

22:00.933 --> 22:02.400
What are we wasting
their time for?

22:02.400 --> 22:04.133
-This is a recap.

22:04.133 --> 22:05.767
But this is not
fun stuff to recap.

22:05.767 --> 22:07.367
You want to see something funny,
watch this.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.900
Sal: Oh, that kid's going up
the slide the wrong way, buddy.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.467
Nice and easy.
Careful.

22:12.467 --> 22:13.867
The lady to the right
of the slide

22:13.867 --> 22:15.333
is just
watching it happen.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.733
You saw
what was happening.

22:16.733 --> 22:19.133
The kid was trying
to go up the slide.

22:19.133 --> 22:20.633
Sal: You did nothing.

22:20.633 --> 22:24.500
You did nothing
about it.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.267
With the setup,
the camera operators

22:26.267 --> 22:28.233
were basically like
playing a video game.

22:28.233 --> 22:31.067
Tony, waist up.
Lee, reverse master.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.633
Now look for mom's face.

22:32.633 --> 22:34.567
Look for mom's face.
Right there.

22:34.567 --> 22:36.500
I have a little angel
who didn't take a nap,

22:36.500 --> 22:37.833
and he's totally like...
Oh, no, no.

22:37.833 --> 22:39.700
Well, some days they get cranky.
That's natural, you know?

22:39.700 --> 22:41.567
If I see the little
I'll point him out.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.433
Yeah, but if I see the
I'll point him out to you.

22:46.867 --> 22:49.733
How do you think
the punishment went?

22:49.733 --> 22:51.433
It spins around.

22:51.433 --> 22:53.667
Yeah, yeah, it spins around
like Joe had to, like,

22:53.667 --> 22:56.167
really spin around this
whole place and figure it out.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.233
Do you think
he was embarrassed?

22:58.233 --> 22:59.700
Yeah.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.300
The water --
did you get that here?

23:01.300 --> 23:02.500
-No, I brought it.
-Oh.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.467
Did you bring enough
for everybody?

23:04.467 --> 23:05.833
Did you bring enough
for everybody?

23:05.833 --> 23:07.267
-I mean, I should have.
-You should have, right.

23:07.267 --> 23:08.967
That would have been
the right lesson to teach them.

23:12.100 --> 23:16.100
**

23:16.100 --> 23:19.267
Sal: How many people you think
we got for the party?

23:19.267 --> 23:21.067
-12.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.533
Is that including
me and you or...?

23:22.533 --> 23:25.267
Celsius.

23:26.867 --> 23:28.867
-For your mother-in-law.
-Oh, I don't know.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.967
It depends if we're gonna
get the almond milk or not.

23:30.967 --> 23:32.733
There's an orange
mango tango, too.

23:32.733 --> 23:33.900
Coffee-Mate
is what I want.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.600
Yeah, get the Coffee-Mate.
Get the flavor.

23:35.600 --> 23:39.167
Gouda
Philadelphia?

23:42.067 --> 23:43.533
Chobani?
