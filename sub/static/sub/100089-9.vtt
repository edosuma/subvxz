WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:05.135
And there you have it, folks.

00:05.179 --> 00:07.268
A laminated piece of paper.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.531
A++ math test not included.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.707
Pronstroller:
Thank you, Sophie.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.970
Couldn't you bring something
normal to Show and Tell?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.319
Yeah, like a ham.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.626
How is a ham normal?

00:17.669 --> 00:18.931
Nice comeback,
Miss Perfect.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.455
I'm not perfect.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.935
Uh, Graham, you're up.

00:24.807 --> 00:28.115
Wait till you see what I found
in Douglas' study.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.552
Hang on to your butts,
my babies.

00:30.595 --> 00:33.424
I got a hot potato.

00:33.468 --> 00:36.340
As some of you may know,
my house recently burned down.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.126
All: Oooh.

00:39.169 --> 00:42.694
And afterwards, I began living
in an old man's sauna.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.305
All: Oooh.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.350
Graham, I don't have space
to take that on emotionally.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.961
My bad, Ms. Pronstroller.

00:49.005 --> 00:53.705
Anyway, I ended up finding
this box in his private study.

00:53.749 --> 00:57.448
What you're about to see
is scary, confusing,

00:57.492 --> 00:58.971
and -- at least in my case --

00:59.015 --> 01:02.236
might make you faint
and wake up in the backyard.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.680
So...

01:11.723 --> 01:14.726
No. No. No!

01:14.770 --> 01:16.250
No! No! N--

01:18.513 --> 01:19.992
You ever think
how lucky we are

01:20.036 --> 01:21.298
to be livingin Southern California?

01:21.342 --> 01:23.039
This school's
on a fault line.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.954
The slightest tremor, the earth
will swallow our children.

01:24.997 --> 01:25.998
Angie: Douglas!

01:26.042 --> 01:28.392
Care to explain this?

01:28.436 --> 01:29.741
Okay. Porn.Porn on the playground.

01:29.785 --> 01:30.786
Porn on the playground.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.135
Children!

01:32.179 --> 01:34.355
♪ And we're looking over here

01:34.398 --> 01:36.183
♪ And we're looking
over here ♪

01:36.226 --> 01:39.142
♪ Whatever you do,
don't stop looking over here ♪

01:39.186 --> 01:42.624
--Captions by VITAC--

01:44.539 --> 01:46.410
You know, this isall your fault, Douglas!

01:46.454 --> 01:48.586
Why would you have your smutlying around our house?!

01:48.630 --> 01:51.372
Myhouse.
And I should be the angry one.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.069
These magazines
were near-mint,

01:53.113 --> 01:54.549
and now Graham got

01:54.592 --> 01:56.551
his Cheeto-dust fingers
all over them.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.074
Now the whole collection's
worthless.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.208
Keep your porn
on a thumb drive

02:01.251 --> 02:03.862
hidden in a ziplock bagsubmerged in shampoolike a normal person.

02:03.906 --> 02:07.431
I'm too rich to be aroused
by digital pornography.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.259
A-A-And what kind of parent
doesn't know

02:09.303 --> 02:11.043
what their kid's hoarding
in their backpack?

02:11.087 --> 02:12.393
A bad one!

02:12.436 --> 02:13.437
Wait, no.I accidentally walked into that.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.613
No, take back!
Take back!

02:15.657 --> 02:18.442
Don't make me outto be a bad mom, Douglas.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.836
He found
yournudie mags,

02:20.879 --> 02:23.055
and now he needs me to talk himthrough what they all mean.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.883
That's right, you jerks.

02:24.927 --> 02:28.713
I am going to give himThe Talk.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.804
Watch and learn, Douglas.

02:34.110 --> 02:37.244
Mom...am I a criminal?

02:37.287 --> 02:40.769
Ms. Pronstroller saidI'm a pornography distributor.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.988
Technically, yes, I guess,

02:43.032 --> 02:44.642
but, you know,
she's a public schoolteacher.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.992
What's so great about her life?

02:47.036 --> 02:48.342
Why am I in trouble?

02:48.385 --> 02:50.474
Are naked women bad?

02:50.518 --> 02:52.824
How else does the storkknow where to put the baby?

02:52.868 --> 02:53.869
Excuse me?

02:53.912 --> 02:55.305
Keep up, Dubs.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.264
Storks fly around at night,

02:57.307 --> 02:59.004
and if you're laying downand making a lot of noise,

02:59.048 --> 03:00.484
they give you a baby.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.051
Sweetie, let's go home

03:02.094 --> 03:04.271
and have
a mother-son conversation.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.794
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.275
I think I need my bros
for this one.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.625
Your bros?
Who are your bros?

03:10.668 --> 03:12.279
My mighty oaks.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.324
Will and Douglas.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.066
Oh. Okay.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.372
You need
your mighty oaks.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.461
More than you need
your mom.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.114
Luhh dat.

03:22.158 --> 03:25.596
Graham,
I would be honored.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.250
Take my branch?

03:31.341 --> 03:32.821
I don't do
the branch thing.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.738
Miggy: Yo, Rory,

03:36.781 --> 03:37.826
we're excited to seeyour outfit!

03:37.869 --> 03:39.393
You almost ready?

03:39.436 --> 03:41.133
Rory: There's no almost.
I'm ready when I'm ready!

03:41.177 --> 03:42.657
Okay.Why is he freaking out?

03:42.700 --> 03:44.746
It's just kids hanging
at Yogurt Spot.

03:44.789 --> 03:48.271
We go there every year
after the Winter Recital.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.491
Who cares?

03:50.534 --> 03:53.320
Rory does. For him, it'sthe fashion event of the season.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.451
He says what you wear
to Yogurt Spot

03:54.495 --> 03:56.279
defines you
for the rest of the year.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.194
It's his Oscars.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.282
Rory: No, the Emmys
are my Oscars,

03:59.326 --> 04:00.762
Fashion Week is my Tonys,

04:00.805 --> 04:02.416
and Yogurt Spot
is my Met Gala.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.113
Now, stop talking...

04:04.156 --> 04:06.985
and enjoy me.All: Ooh!

04:07.029 --> 04:08.291
Ooh! Yeah.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.207
2000s pop meets
War on Terror.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.557
And custom patchworkby Miggy.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.907
We collaborated on the 'fit.

04:15.951 --> 04:16.952
Now, give me some.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.562
Did we collaborate?

04:18.606 --> 04:20.129
I mean, I told you where
to bedazzle, and you did.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.566
Why do I have to be smallfor you to be big?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.612
Hey, Miggy,
come here for a sec.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.137
Does Amy look
a little down to you?

04:28.180 --> 04:30.008
Mm.
It's just now thatI'm dating their dad,

04:30.052 --> 04:32.446
I want to get to know the twins
as individuals, you know?

04:32.489 --> 04:33.534
Ooh, not a good idea.

04:33.577 --> 04:36.450
Getting to know the girlscan only lead to trouble.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.668
They tricked me

04:37.712 --> 04:39.757
into letting themdrive on the highway.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.459
Hey.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.025
Everything okay, Amy?

04:47.069 --> 04:49.767
I guess I've been kind of bummedsince Sears went under.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.465
Okay.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.684
I was thinking maybe something
more recent and personal.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.773
Well...

04:55.817 --> 04:58.515
everyone's dressing upfor Yogurt Spot,

04:58.559 --> 05:00.561
and I'm wearing this.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.172
Oh. Well, let's find you
an outfit of your own.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.695
Maybe something less...

05:04.739 --> 05:06.958
1992 Disneyland
tram driver.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.570
But Emma and I
agreed on chinos.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.268
She wouldn't likeif I tried something new.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.444
Look, Emma's your sister.
She's gonna support you.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.752
Let me help you find an outfit
that screams "Amy Fogerty."

05:17.795 --> 05:21.712
I'm telling you, Poppy,you don't understand.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.149
She's very controlling.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.238
Amy,
roll your sleeves down.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.544
You look like a grocer.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.377
I mean, it's not my faultI only get A's.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.596
Our classis graded on a curve

05:35.639 --> 05:37.859
and, well,you've seen my classmates.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.426
Anyway, I can tellyou're not listening to me.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.731
Yeah, yeah, life is wild.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.255
Uh, do you think
I'm a bad mom?

05:43.299 --> 05:44.648
Of course not.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.215
I love shopping with you.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.260
We never even go nearthe produce aisle.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.392
Just junk food.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.438
Hello?
I got peanut butter pretzels.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.744
That's nuts and grains,
dumb-dumb.

05:53.788 --> 05:57.052
Oh, wait,time for a little dip!

05:58.358 --> 05:59.533
Ma'am,
we've told you before,

05:59.576 --> 06:00.882
you can't eat food
out of the bins.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.666
It's sampling.

06:02.710 --> 06:03.885
It's shoplifting.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.190
Angie, you know

06:05.234 --> 06:06.627
you're banned
from the bulk foods area.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.759
Come on, Steve.I've been really low lately.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.848
Can't you just cut me
a break?

06:10.892 --> 06:12.546
I have to do my job.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.069
This game of cat and mouse
is killing me.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.811
Fine.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.901
I'll escort myself out.

06:19.944 --> 06:22.425
Enjoy being singlethe rest of your life, Steve.What?

06:24.035 --> 06:25.820
You could've had
all this.

06:27.517 --> 06:30.651
Listen, parents shouldn't talkto their kids about sex.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.000
I never got a talk.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.610
Everything
turned out great.

06:33.654 --> 06:37.092
I was minding my own businessone night,

06:37.135 --> 06:40.487
using a slide rule to performlong division,

06:40.530 --> 06:42.576
when my father,without explanation,

06:42.619 --> 06:45.230
slid something
under my door.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.884
A dirty flip book.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.844
A racy thrillfrom a simpler time.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.715
A time when people
would drop dead

06:51.759 --> 06:54.675
if they left their window openon a cold night.

06:54.718 --> 06:59.462
So a naked dancing ladywent a long way.

06:59.506 --> 07:03.031
It was the fondest memoryof my old man.

07:03.074 --> 07:06.034
And also how I developedjuvenile arthritis in my thumb.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.818
Alright, this iswhat we got to do --

07:07.862 --> 07:10.560
we got to give Grahamthe nudie magazines.

07:10.604 --> 07:11.735
We say nothing.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.302
We let him work it outon his own.

07:13.345 --> 07:16.566
Your father was super creepy
and irresponsible.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.263
Luckily, my father gave me
a sex talk

07:18.307 --> 07:20.091
that was
absolutely gorgeous.

07:20.135 --> 07:23.617
Gross.It left me feeling empowered
and fearless,

07:23.660 --> 07:26.141
but respectful of the beauty
of human sexual congress.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.534
You're vile.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.144
And why did I have
such a great talk?

07:29.187 --> 07:32.713
Because my father was
a middle school health teacher.

07:32.756 --> 07:36.107
That is the Rosetta stoneof your entire personality.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.283
Yep. Mrs. Hawthorne would teach
all the girls,

07:38.327 --> 07:39.502
and then my dad
would teach the boys,

07:39.546 --> 07:40.851
and we'd all come together

07:40.895 --> 07:43.506
for state-mandated
square-dancing lessons.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.640
My father is my hero
and a paragon of sexual health.

07:46.683 --> 07:50.513
He did for sex talks what
Mr. Rogers did for dog death.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.733
Sounds like a glass of skim milkcome to life.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.909
Well, my parents have been
married for 40 years.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.301
I guess they're doing
something right.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.129
And where are we
landing here?

07:58.173 --> 08:00.175
We are going
to perfectly recreate

08:00.218 --> 08:02.351
the experience my father gave mefor Graham. So...

08:02.394 --> 08:03.787
...do you want to drive?

08:03.831 --> 08:04.788
Drive?

08:04.832 --> 08:06.094
To a secondary location?

08:06.137 --> 08:08.183
Like a murderer?
Yeah.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.141
'Cause we're gonna murder
this sex talk.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.882
And like a murderer,

08:11.926 --> 08:14.319
I have already picked out
the perfect location --

08:14.363 --> 08:16.626
a place pulsating
with testosterone,

08:16.670 --> 08:18.541
where men can be men,

08:18.585 --> 08:21.588
where the power of the
human body is on full display.

08:34.644 --> 08:35.863
Hi, Douglas!

08:38.866 --> 08:40.476
We wouldn't be friends
if we didn't have kids!

08:40.520 --> 08:41.999
That I know!

08:49.616 --> 08:51.792
Ha-ha!

08:51.835 --> 08:53.010
Graham: Heck yeah.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.664
Now, that's a workout.

08:54.708 --> 08:55.709
Yeah.
Got to get that blood pumping

08:55.752 --> 08:58.668
before we sit down
for our age-appropriate talk.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.366
You know, my dad brought me
to this very roller rink

09:01.410 --> 09:03.064
before he sat me down
to have the same talk.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.718
Good man, I'm sure.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.720
And now he's
with the angels.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.592
Uh, no,
he's a 67-year-old retiree

09:09.636 --> 09:10.985
living in a planned community
in Reseda,

09:11.028 --> 09:12.813
but I appreciate
the sentiment.

09:12.856 --> 09:16.991
Now, what do you say we load upon some nachos and dive in, huh?

09:17.034 --> 09:18.819
An uncreased ten?

09:18.862 --> 09:20.472
Now you've got
my attention.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.433
See? Look at how happy
that boy is.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.696
My father's plan
is working.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.655
You excite the body,
you sate the hunger

09:28.698 --> 09:30.395
before launching
into a deep dive

09:30.439 --> 09:31.919
on the wonders
of human genitals.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.314
Were you gonna skate?

09:41.450 --> 09:42.973
My father's textbook.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.671
I snagged it the dayMia got pregnant.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.673
I always knew that one day,I would use this book

09:46.716 --> 09:47.891
to teach my son --

09:47.935 --> 09:49.632
or my friend's son --about sex.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.242
I feel we're gonna be
leaving here

09:51.286 --> 09:52.548
in the back
of a cop car.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.636
Oh, man.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.986
This is bringing backa lot of memories.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.640
Each chapter is a jewel.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.815
Look,"When Showers Get Longer."

09:58.859 --> 10:00.208
"Hair There Now."

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
"Mom, You Gotta Knock."

10:01.905 --> 10:03.907
"Secretions."

10:03.951 --> 10:05.822
What is this?

10:05.866 --> 10:07.694
"Dear Bud."

10:07.737 --> 10:08.999
My dad's name's Bud.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.306
Like a golden retriever.
It tracks.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.743
"I can't wait for youto rip my" --

10:13.787 --> 10:16.354
Oh. Oh.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.574
Language getsa little graphic after that.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.708
I think this a love letterwritten by my mother.

10:21.751 --> 10:25.233
I mean, the handwriting'sa little different.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.713
She was probablyon the back of a bumpy bus

10:26.756 --> 10:27.714
when she wrote this.

10:27.757 --> 10:28.715
It's so cute.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.455
Uh, I-I don't know
how to say this,

10:30.499 --> 10:34.329
but I'm hoping this is
a naked picture of your mother.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.374
Mrs. Hawthorne?

10:36.418 --> 10:38.159
The female health teacher?

10:38.202 --> 10:40.944
Oh, my God. I was actually
paying attention to you.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.293
Th-- That means my dad...

10:42.337 --> 10:43.338
was a cheater.

10:45.775 --> 10:46.776
Terrible thing.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.039
Shameful.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.911
I don't know.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.390
I mean, maybe I'm being hardon myself.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.828
I just feel like
the worst mom ever.

10:54.871 --> 10:55.698
Oh, marshmallowsgo on the top shelf.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.352
Let me knowif you need a ladder.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.832
Don't beat yourself up.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.485
How can I not?

11:00.529 --> 11:01.965
And the facts don't lie.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.271
My son got suspended,

11:03.314 --> 11:05.534
we're livingin a windowless hot room

11:05.577 --> 11:06.709
because I burned
our house down,

11:06.753 --> 11:08.102
and look --

11:08.145 --> 11:11.105
I bought cat foodthinking it was tuna.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.934
And, Sophie,I'm gonna feed this to Graham.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.762
That's not great.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.720
I think the biggest kickin the nuts

11:17.764 --> 11:20.201
is that Graham didn't thinkthat I could give him The Talk.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.637
A talk?
About what?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.204
Oh.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.597
About how magnets work.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.210
Look...for what it's worth,

11:29.253 --> 11:30.777
I think
you're a great mom.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.736
Oh, shut your perfect,dumb mouth.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.911
Seriously, Angie.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.739
You're an inspiration.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.828
I am?

11:38.872 --> 11:40.395
Yeah.
Because of you,

11:40.438 --> 11:43.877
I was inspired to sampleall this stuff from the store.

11:49.273 --> 11:52.799
And that's another gutter ball
for ol' D'Amato.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.323
Alright, Emma, your sister's
being very brave

11:55.366 --> 11:56.672
and trying a new look,

11:56.716 --> 11:58.195
so I want you to be
very supportive.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.154
I hear you.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.025
No deal.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.338
Individually,
this is a mess,

12:10.381 --> 12:12.035
but all together,
it's horrible.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.037
What do youthink,
Emma?

12:14.081 --> 12:16.170
I...

12:17.911 --> 12:19.477
...love it!

12:21.871 --> 12:23.264
Yo, I was wrong.

12:23.307 --> 12:24.787
You really bonded
with Amy.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.181
Maybe they are human.

12:27.224 --> 12:30.445
Poppy, I want you to make me
an outfit exactly like this.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.360
Of course.
Happy to make you one, too.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.927
Wait. But this is mylook.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.450
It's ourlook now.

12:35.493 --> 12:38.061
I just want to look differentfor one night in my life.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.628
Take off the cape.
It's changed you.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.587
Raaaah!

12:42.631 --> 12:43.675
Get off of me!

12:43.719 --> 12:45.286
I just wanted to be
my own person!

12:45.329 --> 12:47.723
This is your fault,
Poppy!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.029
Amy: Aah!

12:49.072 --> 12:51.074
I am freaking out.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.597
Come on.
Keep it together.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.078
Where's all that
"sex is beautiful" energy?

12:55.122 --> 12:56.863
Sex clearlyis not beautiful, okay?

12:56.906 --> 12:58.429
It's depraved
and disgusting,

12:58.473 --> 12:59.474
and according
to that letter,

12:59.517 --> 13:01.084
it's mostly done
in the mat room

13:01.128 --> 13:02.390
of a middle school
gymnasium.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.044
A little further down,
it implies

13:04.087 --> 13:07.047
that they also did some stuff
in the dead end of a corn maze.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.178
God.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.701
I can't do this talk.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.094
Douglas,
you got to tag in.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.096
I'm not tagging in
on a sex talk.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.446
What are you? Nuts?Well, how can I talkabout sex and trust when the man

13:15.490 --> 13:17.622
who told me all about itis a philanderer, okay?

13:17.666 --> 13:20.495
Oh, someone got nachos!

13:20.538 --> 13:22.714
Sorry, Will, no change
on that ten-spot.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.455
Ooh, hey, cool textbook.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.457
Yes, it's very cool.

13:26.501 --> 13:29.112
It's actually my father's --the dirty liar.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.202
You okay, Big Dubs?

13:32.246 --> 13:35.684
Alright,
it's talk time.

13:35.727 --> 13:36.772
Douglas, you want
to kick things off?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.861
Pass.
Cool.

13:38.905 --> 13:43.083
Graham, when a man lovesa woman...

13:43.126 --> 13:46.086
Oh, God.
My poor mother.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.915
My fatheris a sexual deviant.

13:48.958 --> 13:49.654
He is sick!

13:49.698 --> 13:51.656
Sex is sick!

13:54.485 --> 13:56.879
Okay, so, imagine...

13:56.923 --> 13:59.490
someone slips a dirty flip book
under your door.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.665
Dirty flip book?

14:00.709 --> 14:01.710
Right.

14:01.753 --> 14:02.798
Is Will right?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.105
Sex is sick?

14:05.148 --> 14:06.193
That means I'm sick, too?

14:07.281 --> 14:10.153
That means I'm sick, too!

14:10.197 --> 14:12.112
Graham -- No, Graham!

14:12.155 --> 14:14.462
Somebody tackle
that boy!

14:14.505 --> 14:16.116
We're not allowedto touch the children, sir.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.031
Uh, it's okay.
He lives in my sauna.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.510
Along with his mom.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.078
They're there voluntarily.
I-I -- Oh.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.688
What is everybody
looking --

14:23.732 --> 14:24.951
I don't care.
You eyeballing me?!

14:28.041 --> 14:30.957
Okay. Emma, why don't you want
to let Amy wear her own outfit?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.697
Talk about my feelings?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.743
You'll have to
torture me.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.919
What?
I'm not gonna torture a child.

14:36.963 --> 14:37.920
Just do it, coward.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
Okay.
Rory, go ahead.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.185
Okay, okay!

14:42.229 --> 14:43.926
I'll talk.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.972
Dressing alike
is our thing.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.278
We're a team.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.801
And, Amy, how do you feel
about that?

14:49.845 --> 14:51.368
I won't crack.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.543
Do your worst.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.631
Alright, Rory,
do the thing.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.765
You sick twist!

14:56.808 --> 14:59.202
Fine!
I'll spill!

14:59.246 --> 15:02.162
I just want to be
my own person for once.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.859
Okay, first of all,
this child torture thing

15:03.903 --> 15:06.166
is very disturbing,
though deeply on brand.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.168
Now, dressing alike, girls,

15:08.211 --> 15:10.213
doesn't make you
the same person.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.433
And dressing differently
doesn't mean you're not a team.

15:12.476 --> 15:15.610
But dressing like a Naziis always bad.

15:15.653 --> 15:18.091
Sweetie, I think we're doing
a different thing here.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.657
Okay.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.745
The thing is,
supporting each other

15:20.789 --> 15:22.095
is what makes you a team,
okay?

15:22.138 --> 15:24.010
You're individuals and sisters.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.402
But how will people know
we're sisters

15:25.446 --> 15:27.361
if we don't dress
the same?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.015
Well, you look alike,
for starters.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.234
I guess I don't see it.

15:31.278 --> 15:34.237
Alright, what if we decide
that tonight,

15:34.281 --> 15:36.022
you'll go to Yogurt Spot
as a team,

15:36.065 --> 15:37.371
but as a team of sisters

15:37.414 --> 15:40.200
brave enough to wear
your own outfits?

15:40.243 --> 15:41.549
What do you say?
You want to go shopping?

15:41.592 --> 15:42.985
Yeah.Yeah.
Yeah.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.856
Ugh.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.336
It only took me
an afternoon

15:46.380 --> 15:48.686
to turn a formerpre-school valedictorian

15:48.730 --> 15:50.340
into a petty thief.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.994
I thought you said sampling
wasn't stealing.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.649
Of coursesampling is stealing!

15:54.692 --> 15:56.477
I was lying!
I'm a liar!

15:56.520 --> 15:57.913
Keep writing.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.350
I can't believe you're making medo apology letters.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.223
You committed a legitimate crimebecause of me!

16:03.266 --> 16:05.225
You're taking this
really seriously.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.270
Yes! I am!

16:07.314 --> 16:10.795
I can't let Will know that Icorrupted his perfect daughter.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.146
I'm not perfect!

16:13.189 --> 16:14.886
Pent-up outburst.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.410
I know those well.

16:19.195 --> 16:19.979
Hit me.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.158
I don't like being
Little Miss Perfect
all the time.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.073
Sometimes,
I want to be like you --

16:27.116 --> 16:29.640
a Bad B
with a heart of gold.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.686
Heart of gold?

16:31.729 --> 16:33.296
Shut up.
Don't stop.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.732
You're so much fun.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.604
Yeah.
I know I'm fun.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.214
I'm fun as hell.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.955
But that doesn't make mea good role model.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.957
It kind of does.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.393
Look, I love my dad,

16:43.437 --> 16:45.439
but he never makes
a mistake.

16:45.482 --> 16:48.485
You're the only grown-up
that makes me feel like

16:48.529 --> 16:51.097
I don't have to be perfect
to be a good person.

16:53.273 --> 16:57.668
So...I'm like your oak?

16:57.712 --> 16:58.843
My what?

16:58.887 --> 17:01.063
I'm your tall, mighty oak.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.238
I mean, you're not tall.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.283
You're more shrub-like,
but --

17:03.326 --> 17:04.675
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.330
I'm your oak.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.158
Get over here.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.211
You know, stealing
isn't the only way

17:18.254 --> 17:19.734
to follow in my footsteps.

17:19.777 --> 17:22.302
I know a couple legal waysto be a little bad.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.347
Aren't we returning that?

17:24.391 --> 17:26.306
Meh.It's already stolen.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.743
Come on.I got tons of fun colors.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.701
You gotta be kidding me.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.094
Will!

17:32.138 --> 17:33.095
Stop!

17:33.139 --> 17:34.923
We need to find Graham!

17:34.966 --> 17:36.316
He's right over there!

17:38.013 --> 17:39.710
Boys!

17:39.754 --> 17:41.756
Get in the car!Leave me alone!

17:41.799 --> 17:43.758
Leave me alone!

17:46.717 --> 17:50.199
Aah! It's impossible to skate
to an improvised melody!

17:50.243 --> 17:51.722
I can't! Fine!

17:51.766 --> 17:53.159
You win!

17:53.202 --> 17:55.335
Okay, watch your skateson the seats.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.250
This is veal leather.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.382
Drive me back to my sauna.

17:59.426 --> 18:02.255
Will, Graham,we're gonna have The Talk.

18:02.298 --> 18:05.954
When I was a kid, I foundsome dirty pictures, too.

18:05.997 --> 18:08.565
And it was scary
and overwhelming.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.308
This is confusing.

18:23.667 --> 18:27.193
No one cared enough to takethe time to talk to me about it,

18:27.236 --> 18:30.021
and I'm ashamed to sayI failed you in the same way.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.632
Everybody fails.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.286
Heroes fail.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.549
Fathers bone all the joy
out of your heart,

18:35.592 --> 18:36.593
so what's the point?

18:36.637 --> 18:38.204
Not now, Will!

18:38.247 --> 18:42.033
Now, sex --
it can be...weird

18:42.077 --> 18:44.645
and -- and confusing,

18:44.688 --> 18:48.083
and no textbook or flip bookor magazine

18:48.127 --> 18:49.954
is gonna make sense of itfor you.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.304
What about a film?

18:51.347 --> 18:52.827
Oh, those can be
instructive.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.437
But you're years awayfrom that.

18:54.481 --> 18:58.398
But i-it's -- it's totally fineto be curious about sex.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.442
Very natural.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.314
It's why you wantto surround yourself

19:01.357 --> 19:02.967
with people you can trust,

19:03.011 --> 19:06.580
people like me and Will.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.234
Will.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.235
Yeah.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.802
Look, Graham,

19:11.846 --> 19:14.327
sex is always gonna
bring up questions,

19:14.370 --> 19:16.764
a-a-and that never stops,
at any age.

19:16.807 --> 19:20.028
So...I'm not a bad person?

19:20.071 --> 19:21.247
Of course not, buddy.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.596
I would tell you
if you were.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.598
Oh, like when you said
I was going to Hell

19:24.641 --> 19:26.861
for leaving a cold glass
on your walnut coffee table.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.210
Exactly.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.820
Now, do you have
any other questions

19:29.864 --> 19:31.996
about the pictures you sawin that magazine?

19:32.040 --> 19:36.262
The thing that confused me
the most was...

19:36.305 --> 19:39.134
does a horse go faster
if you ride on it naked?

19:40.353 --> 19:41.354
Yes.Yes.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.314
♪ We livin' like... It's me.
Amy Fogerty.

19:45.358 --> 19:46.446
And I'm Emma.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.099
And even thoughwe're not dressed alike,

19:48.143 --> 19:49.231
we're still sisters.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.842
Sorry.
I'm blind after sunset.

19:51.886 --> 19:54.584
Yeah. Thanks.

19:54.628 --> 19:55.585
Poppy!

19:55.629 --> 19:57.370
Hi.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.589
You both look so great.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.330
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.247
Wait, did the girls
just hug you?

20:05.291 --> 20:07.858
Oh, yeah.
You know, we bonded.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.382
You're amazing.

20:09.425 --> 20:10.600
I never knew their armsbent that way.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.648
And I guess it's probablya lack of wind resistance,

20:14.691 --> 20:16.650
so the horse
can just zoom.

20:16.693 --> 20:17.607
Cool.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.872
Hey, sweetie.Are you feeling better?

20:21.916 --> 20:24.266
Yeah, Mom.
Will and Douglas were great,

20:24.310 --> 20:26.137
but next time,
I'd rather skate with you.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.922
Aw.
Thank you.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.706
I actually really neededto hear that.

20:29.750 --> 20:30.446
Love you.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.535
Rocco!

20:32.579 --> 20:35.712
Wait, why are you
wearing skates?

20:35.756 --> 20:39.281
So, how did the talk go?

20:39.325 --> 20:41.414
Um, pretty good.

20:41.457 --> 20:42.415
Except for the fact
that I found out

20:42.458 --> 20:43.764
my father's been cheatingon my mother

20:43.807 --> 20:45.548
for many, many years.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.333
Oh, man.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.987
Not dope, dude.
Mnh-mnh.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.075
Not dope.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.990
No.
For sure.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.557
Hey, how was your daywith Sophie?

20:54.601 --> 20:55.732
Where is she,
by the way?

20:55.776 --> 20:58.387
Oh, she's right there.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.389
Oh.
You dyed her hair.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.651
I'll kill you.

21:01.695 --> 21:02.783
I'm so sorry.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.525
I-I think she's just
trying to mix it up.

21:05.568 --> 21:06.787
Mm.Is there any chance that you
could be on board with it?

21:06.830 --> 21:09.442
You're sure the dye'snon-toxic, though, right?

21:09.485 --> 21:11.444
No, no, no. It's hair dye
from the grocery store.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.446
It's definitely toxic,

21:13.489 --> 21:14.751
so just squeeze my arm
and smile at your daughter.

21:14.795 --> 21:15.796
Uh-huh.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.014
Hi, Sophie!

21:17.058 --> 21:18.799
You look great!

21:18.842 --> 21:22.933
I'm totally fine with it!

21:22.977 --> 21:24.544
This has been
a really bad day.
