nasal and zygomatic bones...

off the hook for this one?
- Yes.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.029
- Yes!
— Um, actually—

07:30.117 --> 07:32.073
I hate to be the one
to suggest this,

07:32.161 --> 07:35.324
but Angela might be able
to reconstruct the face
from the face.

to wash away the evidence.
- Huh. Did it work?

What the hell
is going on here?
Pumpkin butter.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.486
What is this, olden times?
[ Chuckles ]

11:04.581 --> 11:07.914
Olden times is not a legitimate
historical reference.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.284
But I see your point.
Right.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.586
[ Brennan ]
There’s a pickle maker
and a candlestick maker.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.164
Oh. I know
what this is.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.420
Okay. What is this,
a time portal?

11:17.553 --> 11:21.091
No, this is an artisanal
community, Booth.
Oh, that’s just ridiculous.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.969
From an anthropological
standpoint, the artisanal
subculture is fascinating.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.300
Really?
Fascinating?

11:26.436 --> 11:28.097
Well, to me,
I think it’s just stupid.
Hmm.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.930
The founding fathers
were heavily influenced
by the Athenians,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.639
which resulted
in democracy.
Care for a sample?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.141
So—
Uh, great.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.644
Democracy, Bones.
Not a pickle.
Enjoy your pickles.

11:36.780 --> 11:40.022
And if you want some more—
Creating handcrafted,
handmade products...

11:40.117 --> 11:42.984
provides artisans
with the authenticity
they feel is lacking...

11:43.078 --> 11:45.865
in today’s technology-driven,
industrialized world.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.696
Great. Okay, eat your pickle.
We’re here.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.494
These are very good.
You should have eaten yours.
That’s nice.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.075
I don’t want a pickle.

11:55.007 --> 12:00.172
In the 1930s, Joseph Ball
killed over 20 women and fed
their remains to alligators.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.295
Was this victim
fed to alligators?
I don’t think so.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.175
Please shut up
about alligators.

12:07.269 --> 12:10.887
Hemorrhagic staining indicates
these wounds were made
around time of death.

12:10.981 --> 12:15.975
The dimension of the “V”—shaped
incisions suggests the weapon
used to create them was a blade.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.105
Those are some
seriously deep cuts.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.653
Which only a serrated blade
should be capable of making,

12:20.741 --> 12:24.654
but I’m not finding any evidence
of striations in these wounds.

12:24.745 --> 12:28.863
- Meaning?
— Whoever did this
is incredibly strong.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.126
[ Booth ]
You okay? Is there someone
we should call?

12:35.213 --> 12:37.590
Usually, I’d say Jess.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.006
We ran this place together.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.005
- I can’t believe she’s dead.
— She is most certainly dead.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.755
Very sorry for your loss.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.215
[ Sniffles ]

12:48.310 --> 12:50.175
When was the last time
you saw your partner?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.602
Saturday afternoon.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.146
We had a pretty good morning
at the farmers’ market.

12:55.233 --> 12:58.361
We had lunch.
I dropped her off
at the free clinic.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.939
Wow.
She was my best friend.

13:01.031 --> 13:04.194
You charge nine dollars
for a jar of applesauce?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.615
Yes.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.826
You pay nine bucks
for this stuff?
Yes.

13:07.913 --> 13:12.498
Every apple is handpicked
from local orchards.
No chemicals, no additives.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.872
You think somebody killed Jess
because we charge nine dollars
for applesauce?

13:18.215 --> 13:23.130
Uh, so, um, what was
the purpose for her going
to the, uh, free clinic?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.176
Jess had lupus.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.845
She went in for her monthly
checkup before starting
a sales tour.

13:27.933 --> 13:31.391
She was gonna cover every
farmers’ market in Maryland,
starting with Baltimore.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.270
We were just starting
to make a go of this.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.190
Can you think of anyone
who would want
to hurt your partner?

13:40.195 --> 13:42.186
— Maybe.
- Maybe?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.895
There’s this creep, Adam.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.858
— He’s been getting kind of
stalkery with Jess lately.
— Stalkery how?

13:46.952 --> 13:48.533
Kept bringing her meat.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.360
Meat? No, that’s
definitely not normal.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.787
Oh, no— yeah.
Adam is a butcher.

13:52.874 --> 13:56.082
He’s creepy,
but he’s the butcher
down the street.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.587
Yeah, I’m Adam.
What do you want?

14:08.974 --> 14:13.593
Okay, Adam, F.B.|., all right?
Let’s put the cleaver down.
Have to ask you a few questions.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.894
Here we go again.

14:15.981 --> 14:20.645
You know, my shop is safer
than any regulations
that agribusiness paid for.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.692
l source all my meat locally,
all grass fed.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.691
- No hormones of any kind.
- Hey, pal, I don’t care
about your meat.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.694
We just have to ask you
a few questions about the death
of Jessica Pearson.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.037
Death?
What are you talking about?

14:31.121 --> 14:34.454
Ms. Pearson’s mutilated remains
were found in a garbage can...

14:34.541 --> 14:36.873
a quarter of a mile from here.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.919
Oh, my God. That’s horrible.
Wh—What happened?

14:41.006 --> 14:45.340
Our evidence indicates that
the murder was committed by
an exceptionally strong man...

14:45.427 --> 14:48.885
skilled at using
an extremely sharp knife.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.473
You think / killed Jessica?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.640
- Well, we know you were
trying to romance her.
- With free meat.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.514
Look, Jessica could
barely afford food.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.597
Every dime of hers went
into her business. l was
just trying to help her out.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.227
For what in return?

15:01.318 --> 15:03.274
Nothing.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.148
Especially after this guy
came in and threatened me.

15:06.281 --> 15:11.071
— What guy?
- I don’t know.
Some big—ass, angry—looking guy...

15:11.161 --> 15:14.995
threatened to crush my skull
like a cracker if I didn’t lay off Jess.

15:15.082 --> 15:19.496
Adam, do you rub ammonia
on your meat as a way
of killing bacteria?

15:19.586 --> 15:23.420
This is an artisan butchery.
I’d never use chemicals.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.168
Look, you can accuse me
of murder,

15:25.258 --> 15:29.171
but when you start
insulting my craft,
that’s where I draw the line.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.843
Good to know your priorities.

15:30.931 --> 15:34.298
We need to examine your knives
as possible murder weapons.

15:35.519 --> 15:38.056
You want my knives?
Get a warrant.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.737
You find any more money
in her clothes?

15:52.828 --> 15:54.864
Yep. It was mixed up
in the garbage.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.742
Oh, yeah. The smell
was a dead giveaway.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.074
Let’s see what we got.

16:09.344 --> 16:14.134
So, we found 20
hundred—dollar bills
on the victim.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.806
That’s a lot of money for a girl
who can barely afford to eat.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.145
Well, Brennan said
that the victim was
at a farmers’ market...

16:19.229 --> 16:21.060
selling her applesauce
the morning before she died.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.638
Maybe that’s where
she got the money.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.439
No, I don’t think so.
Look at this.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.233
The bills are sequential.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.936
[ Hodgins ]
Meaning that they came
from the same source.

16:30.031 --> 16:33.569
We love our kid, but we’re not
spending two grand a month on
applesauce at a farmers’ market.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.743
[ Sighs ]
What is she doing
with all this cash?

16:36.830 --> 16:40.618
And why was she making
monthly trips to the doctor
for blood tests?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.574
Her partner said
that she had lupus.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.034
I know, but she didn’t.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.496
I tested all the tissue.
Our victim was perfectly healthy.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.128
She was lying to her partner,
but the question is why.

16:50.218 --> 16:54.678
Regular doctor visits
for no reason,
a wad of cash.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.300
You think she was selling pills?

17:00.395 --> 17:01.726
[ Fussing ]
Want more?

17:01.813 --> 17:04.054
Aw. Booth is upset
that I pay...

17:04.149 --> 17:06.185
nine dollars a jar
for Christine’s applesauce.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.892
Well, artisanal products are
more expensive to produce,

17:08.987 --> 17:10.352
so they’re more expensive
to purchase.

17:10.447 --> 17:13.029
But the real value
comes in knowing
that they’re not made...

17:13.116 --> 17:15.823
by some faceless,
soul—destroying corporation.

17:15.911 --> 17:19.119
You seem to have a real
appreciation for the artisan,
Sweets.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.912
| used to work in a record shop.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.920
I’m afraid Christine will
never know what a record is.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.165
[ Sweets ]
Digital will never
replace vinyl.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.962
Hey there, you three. Huh?
Let’s go, Sweets.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.760
— Booth, Sweets was going
to get a hotel room.
— Hotels are nice.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.714
— Yeah, I’ll be fine.
— No, if you stay at a hotel,

17:38.808 --> 17:40.969
you will feel rushed
and you’ll take an apartment...

17:41.061 --> 17:43.677
that does not align
with your sensibilities.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.262
Wait a second.
Sweets has sensibilities?

17:45.357 --> 17:47.188
Yes. He worked
in a record shop.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.058
— So?
— I think what
Dr. Brennan means...

17:50.153 --> 17:53.771
is that working in a moribund enterprise
gave me a lasting appreciation...

17:53.865 --> 17:56.242
for the craftsmanship
that goes into making a record.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.159
You know, I remember stocking
this T. Rex album.

17:59.246 --> 18:03.034
Uh, the one with “20th Century Boy.”
And the liner notes, the album art,

18:03.124 --> 18:04.910
even the tactile feel of the vinyl—

18:05.001 --> 18:08.493
— And so you need an apartment
that tickles your same fancy.
- Yeah.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.080
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.
Those are my underwear, pal.
What is he doing?

18:12.175 --> 18:15.133
Sweets has been very helpful.
He vacuumed, did the laundry.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.678
All right, that’s great and all,
but a man doesn’t fold
another man’s underwear.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.346
Are those
Captain America boxers?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.266
[ Brennan ]
Booth has
a nostalgic side too.

18:23.353 --> 18:27.141
You know, psychologically,
we yearn for our past
because we fear our future.

18:27.232 --> 18:32.147
Or you just like Captain America
or old records or your own
apartment. So can we go now?

18:32.237 --> 18:34.444
Come on, we have a doctor
to talk to.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.396
Let’s go. Thanks.
Thanks for that.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.990
Appreciate it.
I’m sorry.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.860
Okay.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.035
I saw Jessica at the clinic
just last Saturday.
Is she okay?

18:50.171 --> 18:53.663
Jessica was murdered
last Saturday evening.
Oh, my God.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.460
Was, uh, Jessica healthy,
Dr. Reese?

18:58.555 --> 19:00.762
Yes. Very. Why?

19:00.849 --> 19:02.714
Why did she come visit you
every month?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.891
Well, that’s confidential
information. Thank you.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.934
Not when your patient’s
been murdered.

19:07.022 --> 19:10.480
We found a lot of cash on her,
so we’re thinking maybe the two
of you were selling drugs.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.023
That’s absurd.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.226
You wouldn’t be
the first doctor...

19:14.321 --> 19:16.812
to make a little extra cash
distributing pills on the street.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.439
Jessica needed money.
That isn’t why she had
an appointment every month.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.866
[ Clears Throat]

19:21.953 --> 19:23.534
l have to tell you, legally?

19:23.621 --> 19:24.872
I’m afraid so.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.538
I don’t want you to get
the wrong impression of Jessica.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.954
Okay. Well, try us.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.582
Jessica came to the clinic
once a month...

19:32.672 --> 19:34.708
to have her blood tested
for S.T.D.’s.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.256
S.T.D.’s, cash—
Jessica was a prostitute?

19:37.344 --> 19:40.086
It’s not myjob
to tell my patients
how to live their lives.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.262
| just want them
to stay healthy.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.019
[ Saroyan ]
Pig bones?
[ Fisher] Yes.

19:50.106 --> 19:54.395
And I believe Dr. Brennan
will heap praise on me
for acquiring them.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.360
Not as if that
will cheer me up.
And why?

19:57.447 --> 20:00.905
’Cause I got ’em
from Adam Borchardt.
From his butchery.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.483
— The suspect?
— It’s a lot easier than waiting...

20:03.578 --> 20:05.694
for a warrant
that might never come.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.871
I figured if our butcher
butchered the victim,

20:07.957 --> 20:10.949
he might have done it
in a similar manner in which
he would butcher an animal.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.535
/ might have to heap
a little praise on you too.

20:13.630 --> 20:14.995
It would be wasted.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.627
Look at the cuts
on our victim’s bones.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.333
Each one extremely
precise and clean.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.420
No clefts, no hesitation marks.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.847
Definitely made by someone
who knows what they’re doing.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.925
Like the butchered pig bones.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.477
And the flesh was removed
in a similar way
as our victim’s.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.351
Is it true that she was
a lady of the night?

20:34.442 --> 20:38.105
According to Booth, she may have
been prostituting herself...

20:38.196 --> 20:39.982
as a way of supplementing
her income.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.031
An occasional prostitute.
Interesting.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.949
I was thinking sad.

20:45.036 --> 20:49.154
The nicks on both sides
of the mandible appear to be
at the ends of an arc...

20:49.249 --> 20:52.537
that would’ve transected
the victim’s left—side
carotid artery.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.492
The killer slit her throat.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.418
Judging by
the microscopic spalls,

20:56.506 --> 20:59.794
the nick on the right side
of the mandible would be
the exit wound.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.091
Meaning the killer
was right—handed.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.715
Which rules out
our left—handed butcher.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.637
I don’t look so good now,
do I?

21:06.724 --> 21:09.887
— Does that cheer you up?
- A little.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.895
Oh, my God.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.103
The killer slit her throat.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.855
That’s now old news.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.904
And she was an occasional
prostitute that was dumped
in the garbage.

21:22.991 --> 21:26.654
There is more than
butchery and applesauce
that’s old—school here.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.196
The killer is mimicking
Jack the Ripper.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.683
Do I even want to know?

21:59.777 --> 22:03.019
Dr. Saroyan. It’s past 10:00.
What are you still doing here?

22:03.114 --> 22:07.027
Oh, digging through
the booze—soaked lobster ravioli
I found in the victim’s stomach.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.109
Last meal, huh?

22:09.204 --> 22:12.662
2,000-buck-a-night call girl—
definitely not skimping on dinner.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.115
You might be able to find
what restaurant she went to.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.450

the drivers caught
running the red...

32:48.801 --> 32:52.419
on Reese’s block
on Saturday night
when Jessica was with Reese.

32:52.555 --> 32:54.341
You think
he was driving?
No, no.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.046
But look at the angle
of the camera.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.428
Right across the street
from Reese’s building.

33:00.521 --> 33:03.137
There he is.
Look, in the background.

33:03.232 --> 33:06.565
— You sure this is our guy?
— Well, yeah.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.985
I mean, unless you see another
6—foot—6, 250—pound man...

33:10.072 --> 33:12.939
in front of Reese’s building
at the same time
the victim was there.

33:13.033 --> 33:16.321
Let’s get the F.B.I.
to put his picture
on the nightly news.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.368
See if the public
can identify him.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.079
Pretty cool.
Well done.

33:29.842 --> 33:33.505
I saw my face on the news.
I turned myself in.

33:33.596 --> 33:35.678
I did not kill Jess.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.016
- That girl meant the world to me.
— What was it, Willis?

33:38.100 --> 33:41.012
Did you end up buying
a night or two with her
and end up falling in love?

33:41.103 --> 33:45.312
No, no. You have it all
really, really wrong.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.560
Okay, why don’t you tell me
how it really, really is.

33:47.651 --> 33:50.188
Jess was my niece.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.144
Ah, you know, you’re not
starting off too good.

33:52.281 --> 33:56.320
See, Jessica Pearson
has no family members.
Not by blood.

33:56.410 --> 34:00.073
Jessica’s father and I
were best friends
since we were seven years old.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.201
When he died,

34:03.292 --> 34:06.750
I promised him that I would
take care of his daughter.
That was 10 years ago.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.452
And why should I believe you?

34:08.547 --> 34:11.755
I got photos of me and Jess
since she was five.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.252
Okay?

34:13.344 --> 34:15.801
Look. High school graduation.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.925
Afterthat, I paid
for two years of college.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.756
You—You can check it all out.

34:20.851 --> 34:25.436
As Jess got older,
she didn’t need me as much.

34:25.522 --> 34:28.605
Maybe I reminded her of her dad.
I don’t know.

34:30.194 --> 34:35.154
She calls me out of the blue
about some guy
who was scaring her.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.032
— The butcher?
— I took care of that.

34:39.119 --> 34:40.859
But I’m not stupid.

34:40.955 --> 34:44.539
I have eyes.
I saw how Jess’s life was going.

34:44.625 --> 34:48.117
— So you figured out
that she was—
- Yeah. I saw it.

34:48.212 --> 34:52.581
— So you followed her?
— I heard her scream.

34:52.675 --> 34:56.759
— So I kicked down the door—
— And you stuffed her client
in the closet.

34:56.845 --> 35:02.431
I came this close to killing him.
This close.

35:02.518 --> 35:06.136
You and me could be
sitting here now,
only you’d be right.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.186
Agent Booth,

35:08.274 --> 35:13.234
you got anybody
that you’re responsible for,

35:13.320 --> 35:18.030
who needs help even though
they feel like they got to be
out in the world on their own?

35:19.368 --> 35:20.983
Oh, yeah.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.572
Look, I’m in banking.

35:23.664 --> 35:25.620
I’m not a big guy.
I’m a medium guy.

35:25.708 --> 35:30.748
But I told Jess
that I could get investors
for her applesauce company...

35:30.838 --> 35:32.749
so that she could stop...

35:34.633 --> 35:37.045
taking clients for money
and make a go of it.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.546
Was she gonna
take the deal?

35:40.180 --> 35:42.341
She said she’d think about it.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.841
And that was
the last night
you saw her.

35:46.729 --> 35:48.560
Yes.

35:56.613 --> 36:01.653
Okay, so this is a rundown
of how the injuries were
dispersed across the remains.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.359
Four incisions to the skull,

36:03.454 --> 36:05.866
seven to the right arm,
six to the left,

36:05.956 --> 36:07.457
eight to the thoracic region,

36:07.541 --> 36:10.248
two to the pelvis
and another four on each leg.

36:10.336 --> 36:14.625
It appears as if the spacing
between the incisions
on the left arm...

36:14.715 --> 36:19.584
is equal to the spacing
between the incisions
on the thoracic region.

36:23.724 --> 36:27.091
Okay, that’s interesting.
Okay, let me try the right arm.

36:28.771 --> 36:31.638
Hmm.
Try the legs, Angela.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.725
Whoa. What is this telling us?

36:35.819 --> 36:38.401
This is the position
the victim was in
when her flesh was removed.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.525
She was protecting herself.

36:40.616 --> 36:43.403
She was cut 18 times
with surgical—like precision.

36:43.494 --> 36:46.486
Why would she stay
in the same position
throughout the entire attack?

36:46.580 --> 36:48.946
Perhaps she was already dead
at this point?

36:49.041 --> 36:51.032
Or worse,
she could have been paralyzed...

36:51.126 --> 36:54.618
and forced to bare witness
to the systematic carving
of her own flesh.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.920
There’s something very odd here.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.464
Yeah. But you’re
gonna have to be a little
more specific than that...

36:59.551 --> 37:02.509
for those of us who find
this entire scenario odd.

37:02.596 --> 37:05.554
These wounds are too regular,
too precise.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.097
Each one is calculated.

37:07.184 --> 37:11.018
The surgical precision,
the working knowledge
of the human anatomy—

37:11.146 --> 37:13.398
I think the doctor’s our guy.
[ Brennan ]
No.

37:13.482 --> 37:17.350
The evidence indicates
that this was done
by some kind of machine.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.154
Yeah, I believe
if Jessica Pearson
wanted to sell out,

37:29.248 --> 37:31.034
her partner might have been
angry enough to murder.

37:31.125 --> 37:32.615
Come on, really?
Over applesauce?

37:32.709 --> 37:34.415
For artisans,
it’s their life.

37:34.503 --> 37:36.744
You know,
Brooke might have thought
that Jessica was...

37:36.839 --> 37:39.000
attacking the very foundation
of her life.

37:39.091 --> 37:43.050
— Oh, better her partner is
a prostitute than sells out?
— Essentially, yeah.

37:43.137 --> 37:44.547
It’s not about money
for these people.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.716
[ Groans ]
You know, artisans
go into business...

37:46.807 --> 37:48.763
’cause they’re passionate
about the products they create.

37:48.851 --> 37:51.433
That is so un—American.
[ Scoffs ]

37:51.520 --> 37:54.227

I’m gonna move
out of the house tonight.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.221

You’ve been great,

37:56.316 --> 37:59.023
but I think we both know
it’s time I face
the world on my own.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.396
[Whispers ]
It’s time.

38:10.205 --> 38:13.493
Excuse me. Brooke Guminski,
we have a search warrant here
for the premises.

38:13.584 --> 38:16.576
Can’t this wait?
I’ve got orders to fill,
and I’m all by myself.

38:16.670 --> 38:19.207
Well, you should have considered
that before you killed Jessica.

38:19.298 --> 38:22.131
We know Jessica came
to visit you before she left
for Baltimore.

38:22.217 --> 38:25.209
- We know what you two were talking about.
— We didn’t talk about anything.

38:25.304 --> 38:27.636
She stopped by to grab a couple jars
before she left town.

38:27.764 --> 38:28.970
Booth?
Yep?

38:29.057 --> 38:30.718
I believe I discovered
the murder weapon.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.640
— What do we have here?
- Nothing.

38:32.728 --> 38:35.891
It’s a ribbon blender.
We use it to blend spices
into our sauce.

38:35.981 --> 38:39.269
Ifthe victim fell into this blender
while the blades were spinning,

38:39.359 --> 38:42.817
her body would have become
wedged to the side...

38:42.905 --> 38:45.521
where the blades would have
continuously sliced her...

38:45.616 --> 38:48.278
at a 45—degree angle
while removing her flesh.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.818
It was an accident, wasn’t it?

38:50.913 --> 38:53.245
[ Sniffles ]

38:53.332 --> 38:57.621
- Bones?
— We are certain to find bone
shards or splinters in here.

38:57.711 --> 39:00.999
Look, it looks much better
to the jury if you tell me
that it was an accident...

39:01.089 --> 39:03.626
before Bones here
finds any evidence.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.087
It was an accident.

39:10.182 --> 39:13.891
She told me she wanted to sell,
and I slapped her and—
[ Sniffles ]

39:17.356 --> 39:19.813
Would it have been so bad
to make some money?

39:19.900 --> 39:23.643
My parents only cared about money.
It destroyed their marriage.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.443
It destroyed my childhood.

39:25.531 --> 39:28.113
I didn’t mean for Jessica
to fall in.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.316
I turned it off,
but it was too late.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.202
I didn’t know what to do,
so I cleaned up the mess...

39:34.289 --> 39:35.790
and I dumped the body
down the street.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.617
I’m sorry.

It’s good to be happy
when the baby goes down.

40:13.370 --> 40:16.453
Is it?
Yeah, it is. It gives us
time to be alone, huh?

40:16.582 --> 40:17.992
This applesauce
is pretty good.
[ Chuckles ]

40:18.125 --> 40:20.741
Yeah. You want some?
No. The wine is fine.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.748
It’s not bad,
I’m telling you.
Nine bucks.

40:23.839 --> 40:27.627
A nine-buck applesauce
is kind of like
drinking a fine wine.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.045
[Both Laugh]
I mean,
I’m telling you.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.627
Plus, keeps the doctor away.

40:31.722 --> 40:34.885
Actually, eating too many apples
could do the opposite,

40:34.975 --> 40:37.808
since they contain
a lot of sugar.

40:37.894 --> 40:39.395
You could get diabetes.

40:40.314 --> 40:41.770
Great.

40:41.857 --> 40:45.065
That’s nine bucks
down the drain, hmm?

that you should leave?

you want him to stay?
— No. No.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.932
Don’t you think that as a man,
I should be on my own?
I mean—

41:23.023 --> 41:24.479
Most cultures
have ceremonies...

41:24.608 --> 41:27.099
