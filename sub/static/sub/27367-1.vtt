00:16.015 --> 00:18.683
(ominous music)

00:30.051 --> 00:33.384
(dramatic string music)

01:02.361 --> 01:04.861
(girl crying)

01:20.423 --> 01:23.173
(woman laughing)

01:52.827 --> 01:55.577
(woman laughing)

02:18.309 --> 02:20.726
(door slams)

02:22.559 --> 02:25.700
(breathing heavily)

02:25.700 --> 02:28.200
(tense music)

02:42.514 --> 02:43.764
- Fucking door.

02:48.154 --> 02:51.154
(breathing heavily)

03:40.841 --> 03:42.421
Mother.

03:42.421 --> 03:43.254
Aw, shit.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.144
Aw, shit.

03:45.144 --> 03:45.977
Aw, shit.

03:50.086 --> 03:53.086
(breathing heavily)

03:56.148 --> 03:58.231
(coughs)

04:08.769 --> 04:10.102
Four, five, six.

04:17.728 --> 04:19.469
Detective Carson?

04:19.469 --> 04:21.867
Detective Carson, she's here.

04:21.867 --> 04:22.943
She's here!

04:22.943 --> 04:27.943
(creature growls)
(man yells)

04:28.625 --> 04:32.125
(chatter on police radio)

04:50.700 --> 04:52.783
(grunts)

04:55.900 --> 04:58.420
- It's been a long time, Brian.

04:58.420 --> 05:01.394
- I was just doing what I was told.

05:01.394 --> 05:04.234
(chuckles) I'm just doing what I was told.

05:04.234 --> 05:05.234
- I forgive you.

05:05.234 --> 05:06.067
- No, no!

05:07.061 --> 05:10.022
(yelling)

05:10.022 --> 05:12.272
(laughing)

05:15.783 --> 05:17.450
- On the ground now!

05:19.263 --> 05:21.545
- You miss your daughter?

05:21.545 --> 05:22.865
- I'll kill you, bitch.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.741
(gun fires)

05:24.741 --> 05:27.408
(phone ringing)

05:29.401 --> 05:31.001
- Hey, B.

05:31.001 --> 05:33.521
- Hey, just studying.

05:33.521 --> 05:34.601
What?

05:34.601 --> 05:36.001
- You're a terrible liar.

05:36.001 --> 05:37.161
- What?

05:37.161 --> 05:38.361
- How's your stomach?

05:38.361 --> 05:39.922
I heard you puked during PE.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.004
- It was after PE and it's whatever.

05:42.004 --> 05:44.644
I'm probably just coming
down with a bug or something.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.325
- Yeah, a procrastination bug.

05:46.325 --> 05:47.309
- No, really.

05:47.309 --> 05:49.059
April, I am studying.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.231
- Yeah, I'm sure you're
thinking about your lover.

05:53.231 --> 05:54.064
- No.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.680
- What, I thought you liked Colin.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.013
- Oh, yeah, him.

06:00.009 --> 06:01.926
- There's someone else.

06:03.253 --> 06:04.293
Tell me.

06:04.293 --> 06:05.814
(laughs)

06:05.814 --> 06:07.226
Oh, no, wait, let me guess.

06:07.226 --> 06:09.136
Okay, is he in our class?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.219
- Uh, you could say that.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.748
- Okay.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.149
Okay, wait, I got this.

06:15.149 --> 06:16.678
Mason.

06:16.678 --> 06:17.849
- What?

06:17.849 --> 06:18.682
- Trevor?

06:20.208 --> 06:21.939
Oh, God, Noah.

06:21.939 --> 06:24.129
- I can't believe we're
actually talking about this.

06:24.129 --> 06:27.350
- Well, that's all the eligible bachelors.

06:27.350 --> 06:28.920
Hmm.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.400
Wait.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.101
When you said you could say that,

06:33.101 --> 06:35.771
you weren't referring to
someone our age, were you?

06:35.771 --> 06:37.821
(laughs)

06:37.821 --> 06:38.661
Come on, B.

06:38.661 --> 06:39.821
That's gross.

06:39.821 --> 06:40.654
- Oh, come on.

06:40.654 --> 06:41.542
What's wrong with him?

06:41.542 --> 06:43.302
- He's like as old as your father.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.672
- Actually, I'm pretty sure
that he's older than my dad.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.232
- Even more reason not to.

06:47.232 --> 06:49.422
- He is mature and he
treats me like an adult,

06:49.422 --> 06:50.512
so why shouldn't I?

06:50.512 --> 06:54.753
- B, that's just so gross
and may I add, illegal.

06:54.753 --> 06:55.586
- [Man] What's illegal?

06:55.586 --> 06:56.603
- Dad, privacy!

06:56.603 --> 06:58.581
Oh, my god.
- Sorry, sorry.

06:58.581 --> 07:00.051
You left the door open.

07:00.051 --> 07:01.391
I just came in to say dinner's ready.

07:01.391 --> 07:02.224
- Okay.

07:02.224 --> 07:04.293
- Hey, Mr. Carson.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.659
What's for dinner?

07:05.659 --> 07:06.867
- Hey, April.

07:06.867 --> 07:08.117
It's spaghetti.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.272
- Think you can stomach
that, B? (chuckles)

07:12.272 --> 07:13.353
- What's that supposed to mean?

07:13.353 --> 07:14.443
- Don't worry, Mr. Carson.

07:14.443 --> 07:15.533
Inside joke.
- Okay, Dad.

07:15.533 --> 07:16.450
- Alrighty.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.844
Good seeing you again, April.

07:18.844 --> 07:20.344
- Bye, Mr. Carson.

07:21.324 --> 07:23.074
- I'm hanging up now.

07:25.825 --> 07:28.492
(subdued music)

07:35.644 --> 07:36.624
- Dude, dude.

07:36.624 --> 07:37.874
You're not gonna cut your mile time down

07:37.874 --> 07:40.815
by trading dick pics all day.

07:40.815 --> 07:42.285
Wait, whoa, whoa.

07:42.285 --> 07:43.118
- Dude.

07:43.118 --> 07:44.098
- Is that Brook?

07:44.098 --> 07:44.973
- Yeah, man.

07:44.973 --> 07:45.806
Just.

07:46.657 --> 07:48.243
- When are you two gonna bone already?

07:48.243 --> 07:49.964
- Fuck off, man.

07:49.964 --> 07:54.284
We're not even like a
thing yet, officially.

07:54.284 --> 07:56.164
- What are you waiting for?

07:56.164 --> 07:58.084
- I don't know, man.

07:58.084 --> 08:00.417
- Well, don't wait too long.

08:01.725 --> 08:02.845
- Friday night.

08:02.845 --> 08:05.887
I'm gonna take her out
to a movie and then--

08:05.887 --> 08:07.128
- Take her from behind.

08:07.128 --> 08:08.684
You're gonna (grunting).

08:08.684 --> 08:09.517
You'll do this.

08:09.517 --> 08:10.656
- Tom, you're such a dickhead.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.489
- Without the hands.

08:11.489 --> 08:13.497
You're gonna put 'em up here.
- No, no, stop.

08:13.497 --> 08:15.917
I'm gonna ask her to be my girlfriend.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.167
If she says yes, then yeah.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.486
I'll take her from behind, you know.

08:21.486 --> 08:25.060
The front and maybe in the mouth.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.420
- You are such an ass, dude.

08:26.420 --> 08:27.253
- No, I'm not.

08:27.253 --> 08:28.210
Shut up.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.091
Get out of my face.

08:29.091 --> 08:29.947
- You never listen to me.
- Stay out of my business.

08:29.947 --> 08:30.780
- [Tom] I told you that.

08:30.780 --> 08:31.703
I'm trying to be your assistant.

08:31.703 --> 08:33.269
- [Boy] I'll jack you up.

08:33.269 --> 08:35.188
(both laugh)

08:35.188 --> 08:37.856
- Um, why don't you go on ahead?

08:39.929 --> 08:41.429
- Okay, all right.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.159
I see.
- Stop, stop.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.460
- [April] Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.700
- Oh, my god.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.117
- [April] Bye, B.

08:50.380 --> 08:53.047
(clock ticking)

09:05.712 --> 09:07.532
- [Teacher] Oh, hello, Brook.

09:07.532 --> 09:09.782
How can I help you today?

09:09.782 --> 09:13.852
- Um, I just needed some
help with my homework.

09:13.852 --> 09:16.042
- That doesn't sound
like the Brook I know.

09:16.042 --> 09:18.823
- Yeah, it's just that
this chapter is so long

09:18.823 --> 09:21.223
and I didn't think that I would be able

09:21.223 --> 09:23.473
to handle it all by myself.

09:25.123 --> 09:27.663
- You know, we can't keep
meeting up like this.

09:27.663 --> 09:30.214
- Well, we could always
go back to your place.

09:30.214 --> 09:33.704
- Not until the divorce is
final and you know that.

09:33.704 --> 09:34.537
- I know.

09:35.834 --> 09:36.764
God, I just...

09:36.764 --> 09:38.347
I love you so much.

09:39.624 --> 09:42.124
- And I want you all the time.

09:45.515 --> 09:50.065
- Then I guess this empty
classroom will have to do.

09:50.065 --> 09:51.305
- All right.

09:51.305 --> 09:53.888
(Brook laughs)

09:56.817 --> 09:59.234
(chattering)

10:05.213 --> 10:06.046
- Dude, there she is.

10:06.046 --> 10:08.363
Go talk to her, go talk to her.

10:08.363 --> 10:09.643
- Hey, hey!

10:09.643 --> 10:11.476
- [Teacher] Hey, boys.

10:16.595 --> 10:19.525
- So, how long has this been going on for?

10:19.525 --> 10:23.175
- For about a month or so. (laughs)

10:23.175 --> 10:24.842
- It's just so blah.

10:30.817 --> 10:32.457
How is he?

10:32.457 --> 10:34.657
- I thought you said he was gross.

10:34.657 --> 10:35.877
- I could be curious.

10:35.877 --> 10:39.294
- Oh, my god. (laughing)

10:43.918 --> 10:46.168
(retching)

10:49.110 --> 10:51.277
(gasping)

11:00.274 --> 11:02.524
(retching)

11:10.725 --> 11:12.625
(phone ringing)

11:12.625 --> 11:13.458
Hello?

11:13.458 --> 11:14.856
- Hey, hey.

11:14.856 --> 11:17.136
How's the prettiest girl
in Spanish Three doing?

11:17.136 --> 11:18.356
- Hi, Colin.

11:18.356 --> 11:19.561
What's up?

11:19.561 --> 11:21.811
- You excited for our date?

11:22.736 --> 11:23.897
- What?

11:23.897 --> 11:25.457
- You know, I'm gonna
take you to the movie

11:25.457 --> 11:26.698
that you were telling me about.

11:26.698 --> 11:27.865
That scary one.

11:27.865 --> 11:29.605
I'll hold your hand if you want.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.085
- Um, yeah.

11:31.085 --> 11:32.965
I'm sorry, I don't think
I'm gonna be able to go.

11:32.965 --> 11:35.996
I'm coming down with
like a bug or something.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.413
- Oh, that sucks.

11:39.887 --> 11:41.247
Well, maybe I can come by.

11:41.247 --> 11:43.423
I can, maybe, make you
some soup or something.

11:43.423 --> 11:44.256
I don't know.

11:44.256 --> 11:45.089
- I have to go.

11:45.089 --> 11:45.922
I'm sorry.

11:45.922 --> 11:46.755
- Hey, Brook.

11:46.755 --> 11:48.755
Hold on a second, Brook.

11:50.530 --> 11:53.030
(tense music)

12:03.098 --> 12:05.181
- [Brook] Do you love me?

12:06.808 --> 12:08.058
- What?

12:08.058 --> 12:10.229
- Do you love me?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.062
- Calm down.

12:11.062 --> 12:11.895
People are gonna hear.

12:11.895 --> 12:12.728
- I need to know.

12:12.728 --> 12:13.978
Do you love me?

12:14.839 --> 12:16.709
- Well, of course I love you.

12:16.709 --> 12:17.835
Why would you ask such a thing?

12:17.835 --> 12:20.866
- [Brook] And you care a
whole lot about me, right?

12:20.866 --> 12:21.949
- Well, yeah.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.373
- What about now?

12:34.707 --> 12:35.540
James?

12:46.218 --> 12:47.051
James?

12:47.051 --> 12:48.801
- Are you kidding me?

12:50.438 --> 12:52.449
- [Brook] What?

12:52.449 --> 12:55.616
- Is this your idea of a fucking joke?

12:57.260 --> 12:59.039
What did you think was gonna happen,

12:59.039 --> 13:01.910
I was gonna leave my
wife, my job, for you?

13:01.910 --> 13:03.200
Get out of my classroom!

13:03.200 --> 13:04.370
- You said that you would get a divorce.

13:04.370 --> 13:06.451
You said that you loved me.

13:06.451 --> 13:07.284
- Get out.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.651
I need time to think.

13:11.651 --> 13:16.484
And don't you even think about
telling anybody about this.

13:24.332 --> 13:25.165
- Hey, Brook, Brook.

13:25.165 --> 13:25.998
Oh!

13:31.252 --> 13:34.142
Is this why you canceled
on me Friday night?

13:34.142 --> 13:36.192
What were you doing in there?

13:36.192 --> 13:37.025
- I, um.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.263
- You fucking slut.

13:42.301 --> 13:44.111
I thought you liked me.

13:44.111 --> 13:45.721
- I do like you, you
just don't understand.

13:45.721 --> 13:47.045
- Oh, I don't understand.

13:47.045 --> 13:48.171
I don't understand?

13:48.171 --> 13:52.579
It seems pretty fucking
clear what's going on, Brook.

13:52.579 --> 13:55.668
You think I'd date you after this?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.335
You're fucking used.

14:00.829 --> 14:01.662
- Slut.

14:10.033 --> 14:12.700
(phone ringing)

14:15.674 --> 14:17.714
- [Brook] April, April.

14:17.714 --> 14:18.547
- Hey, B, what happened?

14:18.547 --> 14:19.902
Where were you all day?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.162
- I had to...

14:21.162 --> 14:22.582
April, I'm sorry, I had to...

14:22.582 --> 14:23.562
I'm pregnant.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.222
- Wait, what?

14:25.222 --> 14:28.453
- I took the test and I'm
pregnant and Colin is...

14:28.453 --> 14:30.754
And my dad, he's gonna kill me.

14:30.754 --> 14:31.907
I can't go to Colin.

14:31.907 --> 14:33.627
I don't know what to do, April.

14:33.627 --> 14:34.488
- Okay, B?

14:34.488 --> 14:37.488
Stay calm, I'll be right over, okay?

14:39.006 --> 14:41.127
- He said he loved me.

14:41.127 --> 14:42.407
He said he loved me!

14:42.407 --> 14:43.689
He's a liar!

14:43.689 --> 14:45.289
He lied to me.

14:45.289 --> 14:46.569
- B, don't do anything stupid.

14:46.569 --> 14:48.571
I'll be right there, okay?

14:48.571 --> 14:50.738
(sobbing)

14:54.371 --> 14:55.772
(knocking on door)

14:55.772 --> 14:56.605
Brook?

14:59.812 --> 15:00.645
Brook!

15:02.093 --> 15:02.926
Brook, it's me.

15:02.926 --> 15:04.176
Open up, Brook.

15:10.014 --> 15:10.931
Oh, my god.

15:32.738 --> 15:33.571
Brook!

15:39.948 --> 15:42.448
(tense music)

15:44.625 --> 15:47.625
(breathing heavily)

15:51.786 --> 15:52.666
- Hey, April.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.666
What are you doing here?

16:05.608 --> 16:06.441
No.

16:06.441 --> 16:07.378
No, no, no, no.

16:07.378 --> 16:08.868
No, Brook, Brook!

16:08.868 --> 16:10.478
Brook, no!

16:10.478 --> 16:11.645
No, Brook, no!

16:13.379 --> 16:14.339
Why?

16:14.339 --> 16:15.539
No.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.706
(sobbing)

16:39.584 --> 16:42.334
(water bubbling)

17:17.277 --> 17:19.777
- Y'all wanna make some money?

17:25.748 --> 17:28.998
(cell phone vibrating)

17:32.675 --> 17:34.995
- What the fuck are we doing out here?

17:34.995 --> 17:37.095
- Just shut up, Tom.

17:37.095 --> 17:39.565
Look, do you wanna make
some fucking money or what?

17:39.565 --> 17:41.935
- This is so stupid.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.215
We're gonna get in a lot of trouble.

17:43.215 --> 17:44.465
- No, we won't.

17:48.497 --> 17:51.378
- All right, he just pulled in.

17:51.378 --> 17:52.368
He'll be here.

17:52.368 --> 17:53.738
Do you have it?

17:53.738 --> 17:55.321
- Yeah, yeah, here.

17:57.158 --> 17:58.168
- What?

17:58.168 --> 17:59.108
A BB gun?

17:59.108 --> 18:01.618
- You said we just have
to scare him, right?

18:01.618 --> 18:04.039
Are you sure this is gonna work?

18:04.039 --> 18:06.659
- Look, he needs to pay
for what he did to Brook.

18:06.659 --> 18:08.159
He's going to pay.

18:09.079 --> 18:12.412
So, just put on your masks and let's go.

18:15.570 --> 18:18.403
- Hey, why do you get the red one?

18:21.621 --> 18:23.892
(gun cocks)

18:23.892 --> 18:25.225
- Fucking punks.

18:27.922 --> 18:30.422
(tense music)

18:32.562 --> 18:34.229
- You got the money?

18:36.023 --> 18:38.583
- April, is that you?

18:38.583 --> 18:39.416
- What?

18:39.416 --> 18:40.249
No.

18:41.739 --> 18:43.770
- Just give us the fucking money, man.

18:43.770 --> 18:45.020
- Relax, relax.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.810
I've got the money right here.

18:50.201 --> 18:51.411
- [April] Check it out.

18:51.411 --> 18:53.598
Go, go, check it out.

18:53.598 --> 18:54.431
- [Colin] Count it.

18:54.431 --> 18:56.514
- [Tom] Okay, scoot back.

19:02.647 --> 19:03.480
It's just clothes.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.313
- [April] What the?

19:04.313 --> 19:05.146
- [Colin] Hey, hey, hey!

19:05.146 --> 19:05.979
Put that down.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.017
(gun clicking)

19:07.017 --> 19:07.934
- Hey, hey!

19:09.035 --> 19:10.371
- [April] Run!

19:10.371 --> 19:11.277
(gun fires)

19:11.277 --> 19:13.537
(Tom groans)

19:13.537 --> 19:16.077
- Wait, don't leave me!

19:16.077 --> 19:16.910
Help.

19:16.910 --> 19:17.743
Help me.

19:17.743 --> 19:19.348
Help me, please, please.

19:19.348 --> 19:21.681
(gun fires)

19:23.024 --> 19:24.909
- [April] Hey, hey.

19:24.909 --> 19:27.909
(suspenseful music)

19:31.631 --> 19:34.631
- What, are you guys fucking stupid?

19:35.831 --> 19:38.748
You think I have that kind of cash?

19:41.231 --> 19:45.064
Did you see the piece
of shit I drove here in?

19:46.473 --> 19:50.140
I'm a public school
teacher for fuck's sake.

19:55.744 --> 19:57.944
Kids, come on now.

19:57.944 --> 20:00.347
This labyrinth bullshit is getting tired.

20:00.347 --> 20:04.194
- [Brook] In her moment of
need, you abandoned her.

20:04.194 --> 20:05.527
You berated her.

20:08.195 --> 20:09.703
You abandoned her.

20:09.703 --> 20:10.536
- No.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.418
I didn't!

20:12.418 --> 20:14.742
- [Brook] You berated her.

20:14.742 --> 20:16.303
- I'm, I'm.

20:16.303 --> 20:17.985
Okay, I'm sorry!

20:17.985 --> 20:19.587
- [Brook] There, there.

20:19.587 --> 20:21.187
All is forgiven.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.800
(growls)
(Colin yelling)

20:22.800 --> 20:24.570
- [Colin] Oh, my god!

20:24.570 --> 20:26.510
- I didn't want this to happen.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.093
Brook came onto me.

20:31.682 --> 20:32.515
- Hello?

20:35.134 --> 20:36.467
Can you hear me?

20:38.365 --> 20:40.698
- I'm a happily married man.

20:42.126 --> 20:42.959
Kids?

20:44.956 --> 20:45.789
April?

20:48.639 --> 20:51.076
- We're at the school.

20:51.076 --> 20:51.946
I'm trapped.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.446
Please, just help.

20:57.811 --> 20:59.811
I'll get him in trouble.

21:02.832 --> 21:07.499
(gasps)
(ominous music)

21:17.857 --> 21:19.357
- You let her die.

21:22.863 --> 21:23.696
- No.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.694
No, I tried to help her.

21:27.694 --> 21:29.194
- You let her die.

21:31.775 --> 21:33.375
- I tried to stop her.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.690
I don't know how, but--

21:34.690 --> 21:38.788
- You knew what was going on
and you knew how it would end.

21:38.788 --> 21:40.868
Did you report it to anybody?

21:40.868 --> 21:44.354
Did you do anything to try and stop it?

21:44.354 --> 21:45.554
No.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.554
Instead, you tried to turn a profit.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.258
How much money is a life worth?

21:53.995 --> 21:55.245
You disgust me.

21:57.915 --> 21:58.915
- I'm sorry.

22:01.318 --> 22:02.151
I'm sorry.

22:04.226 --> 22:06.526
(ominous screeching)

22:06.526 --> 22:08.693
(gasping)

22:27.865 --> 22:29.605
(April screams)

22:29.605 --> 22:30.605
- Fuck this.

22:33.515 --> 22:35.098
You son of a bitch!

22:36.082 --> 22:37.443
(yells)

22:37.443 --> 22:39.163
- Where do you think you're going?

22:39.163 --> 22:40.204
- Brook?

22:40.204 --> 22:42.485
- You said that you loved me.

22:42.485 --> 22:44.766
You said that you loved me.

22:44.766 --> 22:47.852
(gun firing)

22:47.852 --> 22:48.685
- Hey.

22:48.685 --> 22:52.053
- How could you take advantage
of a teenage girl like that?

22:52.053 --> 22:54.094
How could you be so cruel?

22:54.094 --> 22:55.009
- No, no, no, no.

22:55.009 --> 22:55.842
I didn't want this.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.042
I didn't want this to happen.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.422
- No more lies.

22:58.422 --> 23:01.689
We both know that this
wasn't your first time.

23:01.689 --> 23:04.550
(growling)

23:04.550 --> 23:07.217
(James yelling)

23:08.440 --> 23:10.010
Do you love me?

23:10.010 --> 23:10.843
Say it.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.600
Do you love me?

23:14.681 --> 23:16.848
(yelling)

23:29.112 --> 23:30.592
- Freeze!

23:30.592 --> 23:31.842
I said, freeze!

23:36.923 --> 23:37.756
Brook?

23:39.943 --> 23:41.343
- Daddy?

23:41.343 --> 23:42.379
- But you're...

23:42.379 --> 23:43.212
But you're...

23:43.212 --> 23:44.192
I don't understand.

23:44.192 --> 23:46.363
- It's okay, Daddy.

23:46.363 --> 23:49.352
Everything's gonna be okay now.

23:49.352 --> 23:51.014
I'm in a better place.

23:51.014 --> 23:54.904
And Lilith, she's gonna take care of me

23:54.904 --> 23:56.904
and my baby from now on.

23:58.344 --> 23:59.177
- Lilith?

24:02.124 --> 24:03.605
Baby?

24:03.605 --> 24:05.156
Honey, I didn't know.

24:05.156 --> 24:06.656
- I'm so sorry, Daddy.

24:06.656 --> 24:08.739
I'm sorry for everything.

24:09.957 --> 24:13.624
And if you want to live,
you need to go now.

24:16.168 --> 24:17.918
I'm almost done here.

24:19.048 --> 24:19.881
Go now.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.828
- What?

24:22.828 --> 24:23.828
- I said go!

24:33.540 --> 24:36.290
(James groaning)

24:47.521 --> 24:51.521
- [Man On Radio] Detective
Carson from Dispatch.

24:54.610 --> 24:56.527
- This is Carson, over.

24:58.130 --> 24:58.963
- [Man On Radio] Did you just respond

24:58.963 --> 25:01.463
to a disturbance in your area?

25:03.251 --> 25:04.901
- [Carson] Yeah, it was a false alarm.

25:04.901 --> 25:07.484
Just some kids playing a prank.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.384
- [Man On Radio] Copy that.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.467
Dispatch out.

25:13.681 --> 25:14.764
- Carson out.

25:16.592 --> 25:19.092
(tense music)

25:39.669 --> 25:41.436
- How much longer?

25:41.436 --> 25:43.396
- This should be it.

25:43.396 --> 25:45.197
Is she secured?

25:45.197 --> 25:46.717
- Yes.

25:46.717 --> 25:50.383
She's chained to the pole
in the devil's snare.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.703
You wanna see if I did it right?

25:52.703 --> 25:54.903
- Did you follow my instructions?

25:54.903 --> 25:55.736
- Yes.

25:56.748 --> 25:58.829
- Then you did it right.

25:58.829 --> 26:00.829
Traditionally, I don't
like to make myself known

26:00.829 --> 26:04.389
until I'm ready to confront the demon.

26:04.389 --> 26:05.722
- Traditionally?

26:09.431 --> 26:11.351
You've done this before?

26:11.351 --> 26:13.352
- No, I haven't.

26:13.352 --> 26:14.552
- Father, when I contacted you,

26:14.552 --> 26:16.753
you said you've done this before.

26:16.753 --> 26:19.086
- No, I said I studied this.

26:20.473 --> 26:22.556
This is archaic doctrine.

26:31.754 --> 26:33.594
You shot her?

26:33.594 --> 26:35.845
- She doesn't go down easy, Padre.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.165
- No.

26:37.165 --> 26:40.245
We perform exorcisms to save the victims.

26:40.245 --> 26:43.647
Killing the body releases the demon.

26:43.647 --> 26:45.487
- Father, this isn't possession.

26:45.487 --> 26:46.904
She is the demon.

26:47.887 --> 26:50.182
- What's her name?

26:50.182 --> 26:51.015
- Lilith.

26:51.015 --> 26:52.237
- Holy Mary Mother of God.

26:52.237 --> 26:53.259
Pray for our sins now.

26:53.259 --> 26:54.569
- Sinners now.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.040
And at the hour of our death,

26:56.040 --> 26:59.860
bless me Father for I
am the original sinner.

26:59.860 --> 27:01.391
- You know what we have here?

27:01.391 --> 27:03.090
First born of the fallen.

27:03.090 --> 27:04.050
- How do we get rid of her?

27:04.050 --> 27:05.521
- You don't.

27:05.521 --> 27:09.432
But if you're lucky,
I'll forget about you.

27:09.432 --> 27:13.015
Problem for you, I
don't forgive or forget,

27:14.806 --> 27:15.973
but I do deal.

27:17.756 --> 27:20.006
(laughing)

27:45.888 --> 27:48.555
(subdued music)

28:31.494 --> 28:34.494
(breathing heavily)

28:54.876 --> 28:57.043
(sobbing)

29:07.295 --> 29:09.378
(groans)

29:28.230 --> 29:30.730
(keys jingle)

29:33.020 --> 29:34.187
- Who are you?

29:35.500 --> 29:36.660
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.827
They said to just walk in.

29:42.027 --> 29:45.444
- [Man] What the hell are you doing here?

29:46.918 --> 29:49.080
- My name's Lilith.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.913
I'm the new caretaker.

29:52.001 --> 29:56.282
- What the hell happened
to the old one, Jennifer?

29:56.282 --> 29:58.723
- Americare sent me over.

29:58.723 --> 30:03.223
They said that Jessica had
to take a leave of absence.

30:06.206 --> 30:07.039
May I?

30:14.090 --> 30:16.201
- I really liked her.

30:16.201 --> 30:18.618
She was good and very pretty.

30:25.481 --> 30:28.564
What did you say your name was again?

30:29.642 --> 30:30.475
- Lilith.

30:42.713 --> 30:43.796
- Not Joanne?

30:47.124 --> 30:51.074
- Oh, I do look just like her, don't I?

30:51.074 --> 30:54.074
I hope that doesn't bring you any pain.

30:54.074 --> 30:56.407
She looks like a fine woman.

30:59.124 --> 30:59.957
- No.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.985
No, you couldn't be her.

31:04.485 --> 31:05.402
She's dead.

31:07.476 --> 31:08.309
- I know.

31:11.406 --> 31:14.748
If it's all right, I'm
here to take care of you,

31:14.748 --> 31:16.248
if you'll have me.

31:19.338 --> 31:20.171
- Yes.

31:21.119 --> 31:22.670
Yes, please.

31:22.670 --> 31:24.209
Please stay, Joanne.

31:24.209 --> 31:25.042
Please.

31:27.750 --> 31:30.131
- I'll take care of everything.

31:30.131 --> 31:32.631
(tense music)

31:53.352 --> 31:55.769
Time to eat your lunch, Phil.

31:56.793 --> 31:58.710
- What did you call me?

32:00.534 --> 32:02.024
- Phil.

32:02.024 --> 32:03.441
It's okay, right?

32:04.514 --> 32:07.347
- Only my Joanne can call me that.

32:08.894 --> 32:10.644
- I'm sorry, Phillip.

32:15.045 --> 32:16.295
Can I join you?

32:19.518 --> 32:20.351
- Sure.

32:31.137 --> 32:33.137
- You sit just like her.

32:35.898 --> 32:39.688
- I take it I'm gonna
remind you a lot of her.

32:39.688 --> 32:41.708
Could be a good thing.

32:41.708 --> 32:43.041
- Yes, could be.

32:47.877 --> 32:50.294
- How long has she been gone?

32:52.178 --> 32:53.678
- Nearly 10 years.

32:56.898 --> 32:58.815
- Good woman like that.

33:00.948 --> 33:02.198
She's with God.

33:08.409 --> 33:09.242
- Yes.

33:20.100 --> 33:23.767
- Think you'll be
reunited with her one day?

33:26.532 --> 33:28.949
Eat up, you're gonna need it.

33:33.892 --> 33:35.224
Tell me about her.

33:35.224 --> 33:37.141
What made her so great?

33:41.584 --> 33:44.084
- I was not always a nice man.

33:45.074 --> 33:46.774
I did things.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.024
She saw right through that.

33:50.625 --> 33:53.465
- [Lilith] What did you do?

33:53.465 --> 33:56.298
- I don't want to talk about that.

33:58.386 --> 33:59.886
- How did she die?

34:04.510 --> 34:09.510
- I guess God decided that she
had been with me long enough,

34:10.630 --> 34:12.463
so he gave her cancer.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.597
And he took her back home.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.061
I hated you for that.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.108
Taking her.

34:31.146 --> 34:33.976
- [Lilith] Yeah, Grandpa
can be a bastard like that.

34:33.976 --> 34:35.143
- Sorry, what?

34:37.536 --> 34:39.536
- I just know how God is.

34:39.536 --> 34:44.286
He says he's doing good, but
it gets lost in the message.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.886
What can I do for you now?

34:57.749 --> 34:59.582
- Maybe a sponge bath.

35:07.671 --> 35:10.571
- You think that's gonna clean your soul?

35:10.571 --> 35:11.404
- What?

35:12.961 --> 35:16.211
- How long are we gonna play this game?

35:17.292 --> 35:19.542
(laughing)

35:21.893 --> 35:25.810
- Oh, I knew this was
just too good to be true.

35:29.630 --> 35:31.963
You've come for me, finally.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.780
And looking like her.

35:36.950 --> 35:39.700
What kind of a sick joke is that?

35:41.311 --> 35:44.755
- Oh, I thought it was a
nice touch, don't you think?

35:44.755 --> 35:46.755
- So, how does this end?

35:48.841 --> 35:51.674
- It doesn't, as long as you live.

35:54.122 --> 35:57.382
But you can't play this
out for too much longer.

35:57.382 --> 35:59.299
The end doesn't change.

36:00.452 --> 36:02.869
- I will not die without her.

36:08.023 --> 36:09.523
- Not your choice.

36:12.343 --> 36:13.843
Time is almost up.

36:14.904 --> 36:15.834
Come on now, Phillip.

36:15.834 --> 36:18.229
Let's end this little charade.

36:18.229 --> 36:22.896
If you do, I promise I'll be
a little bit easier on you.

36:24.021 --> 36:26.731
(laughing)

36:26.731 --> 36:27.564
- Easy?

36:29.981 --> 36:32.314
How do you make Hell easier?

36:34.521 --> 36:39.188
Besides, you are not the man
that I made this deal with.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.754
- No, but we're under new management.

36:51.105 --> 36:54.605
Daddy handed all of his duties over to me.

36:55.585 --> 36:58.108
I'm the one who's in charge now.

36:58.108 --> 37:01.525
And I say if we clean this mess up today,

37:02.988 --> 37:05.738
I can grant you a small reprieve.

37:10.070 --> 37:12.237
- Can you put me with her?

37:14.991 --> 37:17.408
Can you take me to my Joanne?

37:19.873 --> 37:20.706
- No.

37:25.832 --> 37:27.313
- I've changed.

37:27.313 --> 37:28.563
I've been good.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.044
I made amends.

37:31.044 --> 37:33.044
- You think finding a
good woman like Joanne

37:33.044 --> 37:38.044
and following her lead will
clean the stains from your soul?

37:38.104 --> 37:40.104
You are an evil old man.

37:42.615 --> 37:44.265
I've read the file.

37:44.265 --> 37:46.682
- I just want to be with her.

37:52.809 --> 37:54.309
- She's in Heaven.

37:55.469 --> 37:57.969
That's not where you're going.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.950
I'm gonna do some laundry.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.533
You think about it.

38:10.900 --> 38:14.150
- You're very condescending about this!

38:16.501 --> 38:18.584
I learned to kill in war.

38:19.843 --> 38:23.426
They thought I would
stop when I came back.

38:25.833 --> 38:26.666
You.

38:27.913 --> 38:30.163
You people, you created me!

38:32.444 --> 38:36.861
- War unleashed the monster,
but it was always there.

38:38.215 --> 38:40.025
- She changed me.

38:40.025 --> 38:42.575
I'm a different person now.

38:42.575 --> 38:44.242
- I need the answer.

38:45.095 --> 38:46.695
- Not without her.

38:46.695 --> 38:49.576
- Again, I need the answer.

38:49.576 --> 38:53.659
- If I can't go to her,
then you bring her to me.

38:55.503 --> 38:59.193
- You want your wife dragged
out of the bliss of Heaven

38:59.193 --> 39:02.276
to rot for eternity in Hell with you?

39:03.695 --> 39:06.442
- Yes. (chuckles)

39:06.442 --> 39:07.275
Yes.

39:08.473 --> 39:09.306
Yes!

39:10.343 --> 39:12.985
- There's the old evil man I know.

39:12.985 --> 39:14.635
Deal.

39:14.635 --> 39:17.802
- (laughs) Thank you.

39:19.665 --> 39:20.832
I'm ready now.

39:28.357 --> 39:32.774
- [Investigator] Detective,
give me a hand with this.

39:33.947 --> 39:34.864
- Oh, fuck.

39:36.337 --> 39:37.337
What a mess.

39:39.629 --> 39:41.264
Did you find anything?

39:41.264 --> 39:42.847
- Still processing.

39:44.464 --> 39:46.964
(tense music)

40:08.286 --> 40:10.786
- Hey, hand me those tweezers.

40:14.866 --> 40:16.533
What do we got here?

40:21.323 --> 40:22.156
Aha.

40:23.043 --> 40:24.438
Open the baggie.

40:24.438 --> 40:25.521
- Let me see.

40:26.739 --> 40:28.339
Aw, shit.

40:28.339 --> 40:29.756
Detective Carson.

40:36.808 --> 40:38.088
- What is it?

40:38.088 --> 40:38.921
- Look.

40:42.689 --> 40:43.522
- Lilith?

40:47.529 --> 40:50.330
- Joanne's waiting for you.

40:50.330 --> 40:55.330
(Lilith grunting)
(ominous music)

40:59.182 --> 41:01.172
(laughing)

41:01.172 --> 41:03.255
(growls)

41:04.709 --> 41:06.959
(laughing)

41:54.395 --> 41:56.062
- You look so tense.

41:58.156 --> 42:00.406
Are you married, Detective?

42:01.879 --> 42:06.379
I was married once and he
was a lot like you, so tense

42:07.640 --> 42:09.307
and always so pious.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.174
- Demons get married?

42:12.174 --> 42:13.834
Ha, I doubt that.

42:13.834 --> 42:16.714
- She's talking about the first man, Adam.

42:16.714 --> 42:17.547
First man.

42:18.945 --> 42:21.028
Before Eve there was her.

42:23.946 --> 42:27.029
- And I taught him how to enjoy life.

42:29.356 --> 42:31.956
I'm an excellent teacher.

42:31.956 --> 42:33.289
I can teach you.

42:35.717 --> 42:37.597
- What do we do now?

42:37.597 --> 42:39.427
- We're in uncharted territory.

42:39.427 --> 42:43.010
I could try a few
things, but I don't know.

42:46.229 --> 42:47.759
- [Carson] Black magic?

42:47.759 --> 42:48.592
- No.

42:49.619 --> 42:52.115
The holy water from the
church is purely ceremonial.

42:52.115 --> 42:55.136
Real holy water has the
blood of a chosen priest

42:55.136 --> 42:56.886
and prayers from God.

43:01.747 --> 43:03.580
- It's not gonna work.

43:04.507 --> 43:05.453
- We'll see about that.

43:05.453 --> 43:06.370
- Oh, yeah.

43:07.394 --> 43:09.644
(grunting)

43:11.504 --> 43:12.754
Oh, yeah.

43:12.754 --> 43:15.295
Oh, what is that, some shit
from the Old Testament?

43:15.295 --> 43:17.594
Rough, I like it rough.

43:17.594 --> 43:20.259
That limbless dumb fuck
could've told you that.

43:20.259 --> 43:21.104
- Quiet, demon child!

43:21.104 --> 43:22.651
(grunts)

43:22.651 --> 43:25.441
- I wanna show you how rough I like it.

43:25.441 --> 43:27.691
(laughing)

43:31.240 --> 43:33.323
(growls)

43:35.611 --> 43:38.278
(woman moaning)

43:49.715 --> 43:53.465
- Couldn't you at least
wait till I was gone?

43:54.476 --> 43:56.756
- [Man] Madison,, Maddie.

43:56.756 --> 43:58.298
Please, stop, don't.

43:58.298 --> 43:59.788
- You said you were getting help.

43:59.788 --> 44:01.810
- It's been really
stressful at work lately.

44:01.810 --> 44:03.477
It was just release.

44:06.460 --> 44:08.061
- Are you seeing her again?

44:08.061 --> 44:08.894
- No.

44:08.894 --> 44:10.001
No, I'm not seeing...

44:10.001 --> 44:11.441
I promised you.

44:11.441 --> 44:12.274
- Huh.

44:15.702 --> 44:17.042
I'm going to the Bible retreat.

44:17.042 --> 44:18.467
Sue's picking me up.

44:18.467 --> 44:19.527
I'll be back in three days.

44:19.527 --> 44:21.738
- That religion shit isn't helping us out.

44:21.738 --> 44:23.918
We need to work on each other.

44:23.918 --> 44:28.501
- That religion shit was
there for me when you weren't.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.810
Come with me, please?

44:40.399 --> 44:41.566
Meet me there.

44:49.141 --> 44:51.651
- Go have fun at your retreat.

44:51.651 --> 44:53.818
Just when you talk to God,

44:55.191 --> 44:58.024
can you put in a good word for me?

45:09.333 --> 45:11.114
- What did you think was gonna happen?

45:11.114 --> 45:14.280
She comes in, finds you
whacking off, and joins in?

45:14.280 --> 45:16.810
(man laughing)

45:16.810 --> 45:19.221
- I gotta admit, that
would be fucking nice.

45:19.221 --> 45:22.222
She's so fucking vanilla, dude.

45:22.222 --> 45:23.842
- Think of it from her perspective.

45:23.842 --> 45:26.112
This issue that both of
you say was in your past

45:26.112 --> 45:28.192
and you bring it back up?

45:28.192 --> 45:29.102
- Ladies and gentlemen,

45:29.102 --> 45:32.673
I present to you my living
and breathing conscience.

45:32.673 --> 45:34.443
- You know I'm right.

45:34.443 --> 45:36.964
- I'll have to agree with him on this.

45:36.964 --> 45:37.925
You fucked up.

45:37.925 --> 45:39.016
- Really?

45:39.016 --> 45:40.096
You, too?

45:40.096 --> 45:42.497
- Hey, you're trying to
build trust in your marriage.

45:42.497 --> 45:43.663
Anal porn doesn't help.

45:43.663 --> 45:44.903
(man laughs)

45:44.903 --> 45:47.063
- If the angel and the
demon on your shoulders

45:47.063 --> 45:51.583
are both agreeing, you
need to start listening.

45:51.583 --> 45:52.443
We need more beers?

45:52.443 --> 45:53.276
- Yeah.

45:53.276 --> 45:54.784
Yeah, we need more beers, man.

45:54.784 --> 45:55.617
- Yeah, angel.

45:55.617 --> 45:58.435
Go get us some more fucking beers, please.

45:58.435 --> 46:00.405
- Jesus Christ.

46:00.405 --> 46:02.435
What the fuck were you thinking?

46:02.435 --> 46:04.226
- Like you're one to talk.

46:04.226 --> 46:07.921
- Yeah, I fuck around, but
you don't front yourself off.

46:07.921 --> 46:10.625
Come on, how many times
have I been caught, huh?

46:10.625 --> 46:11.706
- Yeah.

46:11.706 --> 46:13.766
- All right, we're gonna
do what we're gonna do.

46:13.766 --> 46:16.791
Don't cause yourself
any needless headaches.

46:16.791 --> 46:19.487
Were you seriously watching anal porn?

46:19.487 --> 46:21.487
- I was, I was.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.108
And it was just getting to the gushy part

46:23.108 --> 46:24.358
before she walked in.

46:24.358 --> 46:25.838
(both laugh)

46:25.838 --> 46:26.671
- Okay, look.

46:26.671 --> 46:27.988
We're gonna have to
change your MO up, man.

46:27.988 --> 46:28.821
All right?

46:28.821 --> 46:30.443
Take it from a serial cheater, all right?

46:30.443 --> 46:31.793
I got this number.

46:31.793 --> 46:32.811
Call this girl.

46:32.811 --> 46:34.691
She'll take you places.

46:34.691 --> 46:36.072
She's a freak.

46:36.072 --> 46:38.082
I had to tell her to hold back.

46:38.082 --> 46:38.927
- A call girl?

46:38.927 --> 46:39.760
No, man.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.712
I don't need to spend money
to get a girl, thank you.

46:40.712 --> 46:41.545
- No, no, no, no.

46:41.545 --> 46:42.503
It's not like that, man.

46:42.503 --> 46:44.013
Trust me, all right?

46:44.013 --> 46:47.180
Look, just call the number, all right?

46:49.773 --> 46:52.273
(tense music)

47:21.219 --> 47:22.759
(sighs)

47:22.759 --> 47:25.509
(doorbell rings)

47:40.771 --> 47:43.091
- Are you the girl?

47:43.091 --> 47:44.271
- I am.

47:44.271 --> 47:45.604
Are you the guy?

47:48.531 --> 47:49.364
- I am.

47:53.272 --> 47:54.105
Darren.

47:55.722 --> 47:56.555
- Lilith.

48:07.923 --> 48:09.923
- So, where do we start?

48:14.103 --> 48:15.686
- Offer me a drink.

48:18.024 --> 48:19.936
- Yeah, yeah.

48:19.936 --> 48:20.769
Yeah.

48:28.485 --> 48:31.735
- You had a friend who came and saw me.

48:33.375 --> 48:34.458
- Yep, Brian.

48:36.766 --> 48:40.086
Older guy, probably a little fat.

48:40.086 --> 48:41.586
- Yes, I remember.

48:42.706 --> 48:44.706
He wasn't the right one.

48:47.196 --> 48:49.328
- [Darren] The right one?

48:49.328 --> 48:51.995
- I'm looking for a special man.

48:53.338 --> 48:55.255
Are you my special man?

48:56.379 --> 48:58.212
I get bored so easily.

48:59.069 --> 48:59.902
- Yeah.

48:59.902 --> 49:02.450
Yeah, I'm your special man.

49:02.450 --> 49:05.117
In fact, when I'm done with you,

49:08.601 --> 49:10.934
you're gonna want to pay me.

49:13.511 --> 49:16.511
(breathing heavily)

49:18.512 --> 49:19.345
- My way.

49:30.924 --> 49:31.841
Uh, uh, uh.

49:33.825 --> 49:36.325
Where is the bedroom, darling?

49:37.605 --> 49:39.876
- Don't you worry about that.

49:39.876 --> 49:42.376
Let me show you how it's done.

49:48.860 --> 49:51.110
(chuckles)

49:55.420 --> 49:57.253
I'll show you special.

50:08.365 --> 50:10.365
(moans)

50:27.271 --> 50:29.521
(grunting)

50:37.599 --> 50:39.766
(moaning)

50:51.179 --> 50:54.096
(breathing deeply)

50:58.350 --> 51:00.933
Is that special enough for you?

51:02.350 --> 51:03.933
Well, I'm famished.

51:11.121 --> 51:11.954
Fuck.

51:14.511 --> 51:15.511
Hey, Lilith!

51:16.942 --> 51:17.859
You hungry?

51:22.513 --> 51:24.263
I got some ice cream!

51:25.594 --> 51:28.077
No, my wife would be pissed about that.

51:28.077 --> 51:30.586
How about some taquitos?

51:30.586 --> 51:32.503
I can heat up the oven!

51:33.487 --> 51:34.320
No?

51:38.645 --> 51:39.645
(growling)

51:39.645 --> 51:40.480
Diet Coke?

51:40.480 --> 51:41.443
- My turn.

51:41.443 --> 51:42.776
- [Darren] Shit.

51:46.641 --> 51:47.891
- What's wrong?

51:49.041 --> 51:50.401
- Nothing, nothing.

51:50.401 --> 51:51.961
Nothing's wrong.

51:51.961 --> 51:54.128
- You ready for round two?

51:57.764 --> 51:58.597
- Yeah.

52:06.965 --> 52:08.548
- [Lilith] My turn.

52:41.932 --> 52:44.494
- What are you doing?

52:44.494 --> 52:46.827
- Pain is pleasure, darling.

52:53.695 --> 52:55.528
Is this what you want?

52:56.976 --> 52:58.309
- [Darren] Yeah.

53:04.059 --> 53:07.142
- Is pain and pleasure what you want?

53:17.225 --> 53:19.505
Do you remember the young woman

53:19.505 --> 53:22.745
who threatened to out you to your wife?

53:22.745 --> 53:24.078
- [Darren] What?

53:25.720 --> 53:28.220
(tense music)

53:29.065 --> 53:31.315
(growling)

53:42.811 --> 53:44.806
(Darren yells)

53:44.806 --> 53:46.531
- Time to pay.

53:46.531 --> 53:48.031
- [Darren] No, no!

53:52.108 --> 53:54.358
(growling)

54:06.019 --> 54:10.936
- I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to ask you a few questions.

54:11.830 --> 54:12.663
Ma'am?

54:14.509 --> 54:16.408
Do you know who he was with?

54:16.408 --> 54:19.928
Do you have any idea what's going on here?

54:19.928 --> 54:22.346
- I told him to come with me.

54:22.346 --> 54:25.679
He told me he was done with other girls.

54:26.596 --> 54:28.236
He was supposed to pick
me up from the airport,

54:28.236 --> 54:29.819
but he didn't show.

54:32.107 --> 54:34.774
I got an Uber home, I was angry.

54:35.657 --> 54:37.718
I thought he was with another woman.

54:37.718 --> 54:38.998
- What woman?

54:38.998 --> 54:41.998
- Any woman he can get his hands on.

54:44.029 --> 54:48.362
I walked into the house and
it was quiet, too quiet.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.290
I called out for him and nothing.

55:00.482 --> 55:02.232
I walked toward the bedroom.

55:02.232 --> 55:04.732
(tense music)

55:07.968 --> 55:10.135
(gasping)

55:17.178 --> 55:19.948
My husband suffered from emptiness.

55:19.948 --> 55:22.198
His lust is what he wanted.

55:23.649 --> 55:25.149
- Did you do this?

55:26.109 --> 55:27.092
- No.

55:27.092 --> 55:29.532
I tried to save him.

55:29.532 --> 55:31.263
He got what he deserved.

55:31.263 --> 55:33.623
He gave into his sins.

55:33.623 --> 55:34.540
I told him.

55:35.463 --> 55:36.380
I told him.

55:43.884 --> 55:45.404
- Oh, Christ.

55:45.404 --> 55:48.125
I've never seen anything like this.

55:48.125 --> 55:51.063
- Did you find all the
missing body parts yet?

55:51.063 --> 55:54.813
- Still looking for his
tongue and his penis.

55:56.564 --> 55:57.684
- Jesus.

55:57.684 --> 55:58.644
- Hey, Ryan.

55:58.644 --> 56:00.359
Check this out.

56:00.359 --> 56:03.859
(camera shutter clicking)

56:06.162 --> 56:06.995
- Lilith.

56:21.499 --> 56:22.332
- I can keep punishing her,

56:22.332 --> 56:25.679
but I can't kick her out of that body.

56:25.679 --> 56:27.512
- What else can we do?

56:29.690 --> 56:30.642
- I'm thinking we gotta think of some type

56:30.642 --> 56:32.642
of permanent punishment.

56:35.333 --> 56:36.583
- Can she be moved?

56:36.583 --> 56:38.073
- Yes.

56:38.073 --> 56:40.553
What did you have in mind?

56:40.553 --> 56:42.644
- This building is being demolished.

56:42.644 --> 56:44.814
There's an old grease tank in the ground.

56:44.814 --> 56:47.284
We could put her in there.

56:47.284 --> 56:49.244
- Trapped here forever.

56:49.244 --> 56:50.964
I like that.

56:50.964 --> 56:52.297
That could work.

56:53.655 --> 56:57.185
- One way or another, I will make you pay.

56:57.185 --> 57:01.075
- You know, I must say I'm very impressed.

57:01.075 --> 57:02.857
You've made my life more difficult

57:02.857 --> 57:05.727
than anyone in a long time.

57:05.727 --> 57:07.407
- I'll take that as a compliment.

57:07.407 --> 57:08.327
- You know what, Detective?

57:08.327 --> 57:10.267
You know what your problem is?

57:10.267 --> 57:13.307
You don't know how to play
this cat and mouse game.

57:13.307 --> 57:18.224
Because if you did, you wouldn't
be heading down that road.

57:19.558 --> 57:21.668
- Enjoy your hole.

57:21.668 --> 57:22.998
I'm gonna go check out that grease tank.

57:22.998 --> 57:23.831
- Okay.

57:23.831 --> 57:25.449
Hurry back.

57:25.449 --> 57:26.866
- Hey, Detective.

57:28.129 --> 57:30.089
How many criminals have you punished?

57:30.089 --> 57:31.650
Not as many as me.

57:31.650 --> 57:34.360
I'm a better judge, jury, and executioner

57:34.360 --> 57:37.380
than your system will ever be.

57:37.380 --> 57:39.547
(gasping)

57:41.222 --> 57:43.889
(uptempo music)

58:36.350 --> 58:38.380
- [Woman] Hey, thanks for stopping.

58:38.380 --> 58:39.340
- Sure.

58:39.340 --> 58:40.173
Car trouble?

58:40.173 --> 58:41.220
- Yeah, she stalled on me

58:41.220 --> 58:42.981
and I can't get her to
start back up again.

58:42.981 --> 58:44.451
- Oh.

58:44.451 --> 58:46.821
- And I've got this job
interview today in Stone City.

58:46.821 --> 58:47.991
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

58:47.991 --> 58:49.161
(man chuckles)

58:49.161 --> 58:50.772
Just not my day.

58:50.772 --> 58:51.855
- Well, um...

58:53.392 --> 58:54.443
Um.

58:54.443 --> 58:55.293
- I'm Melissa.

58:55.293 --> 58:57.653
- Melissa, that's a lovely name.

58:57.653 --> 58:59.084
- Thank you.

58:59.084 --> 59:01.944
- Well, Melissa, it's your lucky day.

59:01.944 --> 59:03.274
I know a little about cars.

59:03.274 --> 59:04.564
Get you back on the road in no time.

59:04.564 --> 59:05.397
- Oh, my god.

59:05.397 --> 59:06.230
That'd be amazing.

59:06.230 --> 59:07.063
Thank you so much.

59:07.063 --> 59:07.896
- Of course.

59:07.896 --> 59:09.280
Well, where would we be without

59:09.280 --> 59:10.880
the kindness of strangers, huh?

59:10.880 --> 59:11.979
- Oh, thank you so much.

59:11.979 --> 59:13.291
- Sure, let's take a look.

59:13.291 --> 59:14.124
Okay.

59:15.715 --> 59:20.706
Yeah, I can already tell that
it could be the rocker...

59:20.706 --> 59:21.539
Oh, boy.

59:21.539 --> 59:23.781
Yeah, look at that.

59:23.781 --> 59:24.976
I can tell.

59:24.976 --> 59:27.434
Oh, boy, that's no good.

59:27.434 --> 59:28.714
- What's wrong with it?

59:28.714 --> 59:31.035
- Um, well, it's...

59:31.035 --> 59:34.995
A lot of things wrong,
but it's definitely...

59:34.995 --> 59:37.476
It's definitely the alternator.

59:37.476 --> 59:38.309
- The alternator?

59:38.309 --> 59:39.142
Shit.

59:39.142 --> 59:40.556
- Yeah.

59:40.556 --> 59:41.836
Huh.

59:41.836 --> 59:42.669
All right, I'll tell you what.

59:42.669 --> 59:46.197
I do have some jumper cables
in the trunk of my car.

59:46.197 --> 59:47.637
Why don't you go and get
those for me, all right?

59:47.637 --> 59:50.077
And I'll get this thing
all set up for you, okay?

59:50.077 --> 59:50.910
- Okay, yeah.

59:50.910 --> 59:52.410
- All right, sure.

59:54.164 --> 59:55.247
- Um, mister?

59:56.705 --> 59:57.705
- Uh, Frank.

59:59.295 --> 01:00:01.025
- [Melissa] Keys.

01:00:01.025 --> 01:00:02.275
- Keys, right.

01:00:02.275 --> 01:00:03.845
(chuckles) Here you go.

01:00:03.845 --> 01:00:04.678
Button right there.

01:00:04.678 --> 01:00:05.511
There you go.

01:00:05.511 --> 01:00:07.094
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:15.127
(gasps)
(tense music)

01:00:15.127 --> 01:00:16.538
Shh, shh, shh.

01:00:16.538 --> 01:00:17.819
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:17.819 --> 01:00:18.652
Shh, shh.

01:00:23.531 --> 01:00:24.364
It's okay.

01:00:25.906 --> 01:00:27.906
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:27.906 --> 01:00:28.739
Shh, shh, shh.

01:00:28.739 --> 01:00:29.572
That's a good girl.

01:00:29.572 --> 01:00:30.405
That's a good girl.

01:00:30.405 --> 01:00:31.572
Shh, shh, shh.

01:00:33.877 --> 01:00:34.758
Shh, shh, shh.

01:00:34.758 --> 01:00:36.508
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00:41.014 --> 01:00:43.514
(tense music)

01:01:40.574 --> 01:01:41.407
Well.

01:01:45.294 --> 01:01:50.294
(drill whirring)
(whistling)

01:01:51.482 --> 01:01:54.457
- Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

01:01:54.457 --> 01:01:55.634
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:55.634 --> 01:01:56.634
No God here.

01:01:57.774 --> 01:01:58.607
Only me.

01:02:02.774 --> 01:02:03.941
You know what?

01:02:04.845 --> 01:02:06.426
I really don't think you're gonna make it

01:02:06.426 --> 01:02:08.259
to that job interview.

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:13.737
(drill whirring)

01:02:13.737 --> 01:02:15.218
- Please.

01:02:15.218 --> 01:02:16.608
Please, please.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:18.441
Please, don't hurt me.

01:02:19.378 --> 01:02:21.299
Don't kill me, please.

01:02:21.299 --> 01:02:22.308
I'll do anything.

01:02:22.308 --> 01:02:24.391
I'll do anything you say.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.159
I swear I will.

01:02:28.294 --> 01:02:30.174
I'll do anything you say.

01:02:30.174 --> 01:02:31.974
- I'm sure you will.

01:02:31.974 --> 01:02:32.807
- Please.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.140
I have a daughter.

01:02:38.741 --> 01:02:41.824
She's waiting for me at home, please.

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:48.234
- And you're willing to
trade her life for yours?

01:02:53.247 --> 01:02:57.447
What kind of a mother
would do such a thing?

01:02:57.447 --> 01:03:00.178
(drill whirring)

01:03:00.178 --> 01:03:01.604
You're mine.

01:03:01.604 --> 01:03:03.164
You're mine only.

01:03:03.164 --> 01:03:05.914
(drill whirring)

01:03:06.926 --> 01:03:07.846
Why are you crying?

01:03:07.846 --> 01:03:09.577
I haven't even done anything.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.327
(drill whirring)

01:03:16.178 --> 01:03:17.011
Kiss me.

01:03:19.139 --> 01:03:21.389
You heard me, just kiss me.

01:03:25.619 --> 01:03:30.036
If you kiss me, I just might
consider letting you go.

01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:42.659
Oh, that was good.

01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:45.976
That was good.

01:03:48.129 --> 01:03:51.879
But I didn't tell you
to kiss me on the lips.

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:56.700
Now, if you even think of biting,

01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:59.851
I'm gonna rip off your jaw.

01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:03.608
Let's have some fun.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:21.697
- No, no!

01:04:21.697 --> 01:04:24.530
(blood splatters)

01:04:32.488 --> 01:04:34.738
(chuckles)

01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:42.086
(gasping)

01:04:47.992 --> 01:04:50.159
(yelling)

01:05:01.534 --> 01:05:03.664
- Should we go up here by the knee

01:05:03.664 --> 01:05:06.064
or down here by the ankle?

01:05:06.064 --> 01:05:06.897
Hmm.

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:10.587
Well, Melissa, it has been fun.

01:05:12.456 --> 01:05:14.756
I will certainly miss you.

01:05:14.756 --> 01:05:16.276
Thank you.

01:05:16.276 --> 01:05:19.193
(knocking on door)

01:05:20.727 --> 01:05:22.560
Did you order a pizza?

01:05:23.697 --> 01:05:25.947
(laughing)

01:05:27.317 --> 01:05:28.150
Pizza.

01:05:30.764 --> 01:05:31.597
All right.

01:05:31.597 --> 01:05:34.547
(knocking on door)

01:05:34.547 --> 01:05:35.964
Lord love a duck.

01:05:38.213 --> 01:05:40.130
Saved by the bell, hmm?

01:05:47.256 --> 01:05:48.761
Come on.

01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:49.928
Sorry, I know.

01:05:53.795 --> 01:05:57.712
Yeah, just go ahead and
have a seat, all right?

01:06:11.285 --> 01:06:13.785
Let me get you a towel, right?

01:06:23.959 --> 01:06:26.159
- Um, I didn't mean to disturb you.

01:06:26.159 --> 01:06:29.441
I just wanted to know if
I could use your phone.

01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:30.358
- Oh, um...

01:06:32.602 --> 01:06:37.435
Phone's not hooked up yet and
there's no cell service, so.

01:06:41.322 --> 01:06:45.405
- Well, maybe you could
give me a ride into town?

01:06:46.528 --> 01:06:47.768
If you don't mind.

01:06:47.768 --> 01:06:49.424
- Uh.

01:06:49.424 --> 01:06:50.424
Here you go.

01:06:51.304 --> 01:06:53.804
(tense music)

01:06:57.315 --> 01:06:58.975
Listen, um...

01:06:58.975 --> 01:07:03.416
Do you want something to
drink like a coffee or tea?

01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:07.416
Stove's not working, but
I can get you a coffee.

01:07:09.121 --> 01:07:11.534
- Yeah, coffee'd be great, actually.

01:07:11.534 --> 01:07:13.400
I don't want you to go to
any trouble or anything.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.233
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:07:14.233 --> 01:07:15.632
No, it's no trouble.

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:19.049
Listen, let me get your coffee and, um...

01:07:27.081 --> 01:07:29.581
You just keep drying yourself.

01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:33.514
- Bless your heart.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.370
(tense music)

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.533
- Okay.

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:01.013
Here's your coffee.

01:08:05.511 --> 01:08:08.428
Looks like the storm's clearing up.

01:08:10.111 --> 01:08:12.861
- [Girl] So, what do you do here?

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:17.993
Do you live alone?

01:08:20.752 --> 01:08:21.920
- Renovations.

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.160
A lot of painting, a lot of drywall.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.160
That's it. (laughs)

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:33.773
Cheers.

01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:48.682
Mm.

01:08:48.682 --> 01:08:51.381
- Wow, it's pretty good.

01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:52.715
- Only the best.

01:08:57.062 --> 01:09:00.062
So, tell me a little about yourself.

01:09:01.693 --> 01:09:03.292
What are you doing out
here so late at night

01:09:03.292 --> 01:09:05.473
right in the middle of nowhere?

01:09:05.473 --> 01:09:08.640
- Oh, believe it or not, I had a date.

01:09:11.256 --> 01:09:14.258
Well, long story short,
it didn't go very well.

01:09:14.258 --> 01:09:18.091
So, I decided to take a
long drive out of town

01:09:19.276 --> 01:09:20.693
to clear my head.

01:09:22.854 --> 01:09:25.687
- You're really far from the city.

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.214
- Yeah.

01:09:29.214 --> 01:09:30.903
I guess I got kind of carried away, huh?

01:09:30.903 --> 01:09:32.682
- [Frank] Yeah. (laughs)

01:09:32.682 --> 01:09:34.765
(coughs)

01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:40.171
- You okay?

01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:41.255
- Yeah, yeah.

01:09:43.929 --> 01:09:45.511
Just a little warm.

01:09:48.379 --> 01:09:51.296
I think I'm just gonna get a water.

01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:53.689
Whoa.

01:09:56.788 --> 01:09:58.288
- Something wrong?

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:00.528
- It's just.

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:06.659
(grunting)

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.707
How did you...

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.051
How did you...

01:10:13.051 --> 01:10:13.968
Wait, wait.

01:10:17.501 --> 01:10:19.918
- You know, I never got to...

01:10:24.673 --> 01:10:28.090
I never got to formally introduce myself.

01:10:30.433 --> 01:10:31.350
I'm Lilith.

01:10:42.284 --> 01:10:44.334
- What the fuck?

01:10:44.334 --> 01:10:45.694
What the fuck?

01:10:45.694 --> 01:10:48.444
- You've been really busy, Frank.

01:10:51.365 --> 01:10:53.865
So many lost, beautiful souls.

01:10:57.746 --> 01:10:59.163
Lost to violence.

01:11:07.587 --> 01:11:10.037
Did you honestly think you
were gonna get away with it?

01:11:10.037 --> 01:11:12.620
There weren't any consequences?

01:11:15.877 --> 01:11:18.377
Did you feel any guilt at all?

01:11:22.148 --> 01:11:22.981
Huh?

01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:23.814
- Guilt?

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.781
Fuck you, bitch.

01:11:28.298 --> 01:11:31.209
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

01:11:31.209 --> 01:11:33.376
- In this moment, nothing.

01:11:39.848 --> 01:11:43.844
- I'll kill you, just
like all the rest of 'em.

01:11:43.844 --> 01:11:45.524
I'm not scared of you.

01:11:45.524 --> 01:11:47.524
(yells)

01:11:49.349 --> 01:11:50.735
- How about now?

01:11:50.735 --> 01:11:52.455
- Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off.

01:11:52.455 --> 01:11:54.201
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god.

01:11:54.201 --> 01:11:55.217
- Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god,

01:11:55.217 --> 01:11:57.565
oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my go, oh, my god.

01:11:57.565 --> 01:11:58.579
Frank.

01:11:58.579 --> 01:12:01.412
Frank, there's no god here, Frank.

01:12:02.392 --> 01:12:03.625
Just me.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:06.125
(Frank yells)

01:12:07.712 --> 01:12:09.962
- What do you want from me?

01:12:13.611 --> 01:12:16.028
- I'm here to collect, Frank.

01:12:17.014 --> 01:12:17.896
- No, no.

01:12:17.896 --> 01:12:18.979
Please, don't.

01:12:18.979 --> 01:12:20.562
Please, don't.

01:12:20.562 --> 01:12:21.808
Please, don't.

01:12:21.808 --> 01:12:22.641
- Oh, God.

01:12:22.641 --> 01:12:24.673
Did the girls beg like you?

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.513
(Frank sobbing)

01:12:27.513 --> 01:12:28.346
Begging?

01:12:29.853 --> 01:12:32.853
I mean, did you show them any mercy?

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:36.445
Any compassion, Frank?

01:12:36.445 --> 01:12:37.278
- Please.

01:12:39.246 --> 01:12:41.413
I couldn't control myself.

01:12:42.772 --> 01:12:44.022
I'm a weak man.

01:12:46.172 --> 01:12:48.339
- You're fucking pathetic.

01:13:01.854 --> 01:13:04.829
(clattering)

01:13:04.829 --> 01:13:05.700
- No, you stay back.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.740
I'll fucking kill you.

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.230
I will fucking kill you.

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:09.840
I will fucking kill you.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.081
(yelling)
(drill whirring)

01:13:14.081 --> 01:13:16.164
(coughs)

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.645
(drill whirring)

01:13:27.846 --> 01:13:30.013
(yelling)

01:13:31.386 --> 01:13:33.636
(growling)

01:13:45.897 --> 01:13:46.897
- It's over.

01:13:50.177 --> 01:13:51.010
Get out.

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:55.250
Get out.

01:14:37.053 --> 01:14:39.553
(tense music)

01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:58.431
- You're a fraud.

01:15:01.005 --> 01:15:04.335
You don't believe any of this at all.

01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:07.066
- [Father] I've doubted at times,

01:15:07.066 --> 01:15:09.546
but you have made me a believer.

01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:11.686
- You don't have any faith.

01:15:11.686 --> 01:15:13.269
No, it's all greed.

01:15:14.587 --> 01:15:16.997
And the only reason you're trapping me

01:15:16.997 --> 01:15:20.997
is so that you can wear
that pointy hat one day.

01:15:22.002 --> 01:15:23.919
I don't wanna kill you.

01:15:26.925 --> 01:15:29.248
I wanna make you suffer.

01:15:29.248 --> 01:15:31.408
And I'll kill everyone you care for.

01:15:31.408 --> 01:15:33.531
The congregation, the priests.

01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:35.093
And then I'll go after
your niece and nephew

01:15:35.093 --> 01:15:36.676
Alex and Catherine.

01:15:37.653 --> 01:15:39.296
- With every vile thing you say,

01:15:39.296 --> 01:15:42.296
you fill my heart with
God's righteousness.

01:15:42.296 --> 01:15:45.463
I will enjoy locking you away forever.

01:15:51.538 --> 01:15:53.288
- You broke the seal.

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.841
(tense music)

01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:26.358
(gasping)

01:16:31.381 --> 01:16:34.464
His praying was getting on my nerves.

01:16:38.562 --> 01:16:39.395
- [Carson] Lilith?

01:16:39.395 --> 01:16:44.395
- [Lilith] And you believed I
would allow you to capture me?

01:16:44.454 --> 01:16:47.454
(suspenseful music)

01:16:51.293 --> 01:16:54.453
The cat plays with the mouse
and the mouse keeps moving

01:16:54.453 --> 01:16:57.036
forward thinking it can escape,

01:17:00.344 --> 01:17:02.261
but it's always futile.

01:17:05.684 --> 01:17:08.351
The cat is simply deciding when.

01:17:28.716 --> 01:17:30.216
We are all Lilith.

01:17:31.786 --> 01:17:33.786
We are all a sisterhood.

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:36.570
We are everywhere.

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.867
We will revenge all wrongdoing of men.

01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:45.177
(yelling)

01:17:47.991 --> 01:17:49.491
Oh, your daughter.

01:17:51.552 --> 01:17:53.802
- You killed my daughter, you bitch.

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:56.272
(yelling)

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:58.105
- Your daughter Brook.

01:17:59.844 --> 01:18:00.677
Take it.

01:18:01.644 --> 01:18:05.604
You wanna be with your daughter Brook?

01:18:05.604 --> 01:18:06.521
Now, do it.

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:08.924
- No.

01:18:08.924 --> 01:18:10.064
- Do it.

01:18:10.064 --> 01:18:10.897
- [Carson] No.

01:18:10.897 --> 01:18:11.730
- Do it.

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:13.958
Do it!

01:18:14.905 --> 01:18:16.285
For your daughter.

01:18:16.285 --> 01:18:17.118
- No.

01:18:17.118 --> 01:18:18.386
- Be with her.

01:18:18.386 --> 01:18:19.556
Do it.

01:18:19.556 --> 01:18:20.646
Come with me.

01:18:20.646 --> 01:18:21.776
- No.

01:18:21.776 --> 01:18:23.361
- [Lilith] Come with me.

01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:24.194
- No, no!

01:18:25.538 --> 01:18:27.871
(gun fires)

01:18:34.022 --> 01:18:36.272
(laughing)

01:18:48.383 --> 01:18:52.225
(chatter on police radio)

01:18:52.225 --> 01:18:55.308
(tense string music)

01:20:18.758 --> 01:20:21.258
(thud echoes)
