04:10.380 --> 04:11.980
Well, I would just think
the biggest challenge

04:11.980 --> 04:15.120
is navigating your way through
a very highly recent business,

04:15.120 --> 04:15.820
as business.

04:15.820 --> 04:16.750

extremely racist.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.010

- Can you talk about that, too?

04:18.010 --> 04:18.710
Yeah.

04:18.710 --> 04:21.370
Now say, for instance,
there's an Asian woman

04:21.370 --> 04:22.450
that comes into this industry.

04:22.450 --> 04:24.820
If she worked with a white guy,
or a Spanish guy from Spain,

04:24.820 --> 04:26.140
that's not considered
interracial.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.310
You're only
interracial when you do

04:27.310 --> 04:28.360
a black guy in this industry.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.090
Really.

04:29.090 --> 04:30.850
So when you see the
tag "interracial porn,"

04:30.850 --> 04:32.120
that always means
there's a black guy.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.250

[INAUDIBLE] the black dude.

04:33.250 --> 04:33.880

people are here,

races are over here.

into perspective--

14:56.090 --> 14:57.560
we're very, very small.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.760
And all the stupid things
that we fight over,

14:59.760 --> 15:01.730
and we argue about,
and we talk about--

15:01.730 --> 15:04.320
they're sort of
minuscule in comparison

15:04.320 --> 15:09.350
to thousands of years of
rivers cutting through earth,

15:09.350 --> 15:11.790
and then drying up.

15:11.790 --> 15:14.010
It defies all the
things that we create,

15:14.010 --> 15:16.200
that we socially construct.

way more beautiful that I

saying, "The world

incredible, than I thought."

what the weed culture is

15:47.780 --> 15:50.330

to legalize recreational weed.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.480

states have legalized

18:06.480 --> 18:08.080
cannabis for recreational use.

But only Colorado
has really become

18:10.530 --> 18:12.930
a robust economy within that.

What means Colorado so special
that this could happen here?

18:15.750 --> 18:17.790
It's worked because
we've done it slow,

18:17.790 --> 18:19.510
and we've engaged everybody.

let's sit them around
a table, and let's

18:33.030 --> 18:34.460
discuss every little
thing that we're going

18:34.460 --> 18:35.850
to try to implement as a rule.

18:35.850 --> 18:37.350
And let's figure out
the best way to do that.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.080
So how come Colorado did
that, and nowhere else?

18:40.080 --> 18:42.180
Denver is a blue
island in a sea of red.

much a cowboy state.

has decided to leave it alone.

And yet, you know, you and other
people who cultivate cannabis

19:08.430 --> 19:11.580
here actually are
looking forward to a time

19:11.580 --> 19:13.920
when it's federally legal,
even though that will

19:13.920 --> 19:15.900
invite a bunch more scrutiny.

opposed to just the state

When everybody has to abide
by OSHA, and FDA, and USDA,

that makes a level
playing field.

that raises safety,

legalize federally, yeah,

you deal with those issues.
