00:02.727 --> 00:06.242
Captain's log, stardate 46154.2.

00:06.327 --> 00:09.160
The Enterprise has entered
the Amargosa Diaspora,

00:09.247 --> 00:11.602
an unusually dense,
globular cluster.

00:11.687 --> 00:15.726
We have the daunting task
of charting this vast region.

00:19.927 --> 00:21.724
(sighs)

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.447 --> 00:48.278
(beeping)

00:51.767 --> 00:55.077
Lt Shipley, get a triangulation
on these sector points.

00:55.167 --> 00:56.520
Aye, sir.

01:04.807 --> 01:08.163
Sorry I'm late. I overslept again.
What have we got?

01:08.247 --> 01:13.605
Well, the cluster is dense. It'll
take three days to map a tenth of it.

01:13.687 --> 01:16.724
- Three days?
- We can speed that up.

01:16.807 --> 01:20.686
We've tested a way to channel
warp energy to the deflector grid.

01:20.767 --> 01:22.678
It should enhance the sensors.

01:22.767 --> 01:26.919
The modification would increase
our sensor efficiency and imaging

01:27.007 --> 01:28.486
by 25 percent or more.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.597
That would use up warp energy.

01:32.687 --> 01:36.077
We'd channel it
through the EPS mains on deck four.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.125
OK. Let's give it a try.

01:38.207 --> 01:41.005
Data, let's get the field taps
on line.

01:43.487 --> 01:47.799
Commander, I would like to remind you
about my poetry reading.

01:48.687 --> 01:51.281
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:57.087 --> 02:00.284
I can't wait to see
what he's come up with.

02:00.367 --> 02:03.120
(Data) We sat on the sand
for some time and observed

02:03.207 --> 02:06.244
How the oceans
that covered the world were perturbed

02:06.327 --> 02:08.887
By the tides
from the orbiting moon overhead.

02:08.967 --> 02:12.198
"How relaxing the sound
of the waves is," you said.

02:12.287 --> 02:14.642
I began to expound upon tidal effects

02:14.727 --> 02:17.799
When you asked me to stop,
looking somewhat perplexed.

02:18.287 --> 02:21.563
So I did not explain
why the sunset turns red,

02:21.647 --> 02:25.765
And we watched the occurrence,
in silence, instead.

02:32.087 --> 02:36.683
That poem was written in anapaestic
tetrameter. For my ninth poem...

02:37.167 --> 02:39.886
I don't understand.
I can't keep my eyes open.

02:39.967 --> 02:42.481
Throughout the ages,
from Keats to Jorkemo,

02:42.567 --> 02:44.956
poets have composed odes
to individuals

02:45.047 --> 02:48.437
who have had a profound effect
upon their lives.

02:48.527 --> 02:50.643
In keeping with that tradition,

02:50.727 --> 02:54.356
I have written my next poem
in honor of my cat.

02:54.447 --> 02:58.565
I call it Ode to Spot.

02:59.327 --> 03:03.161
Felis catus
is your taxonomic nomenclature,

03:03.647 --> 03:07.481
An endothermic quadruped,
carnivorous by nature.

03:07.567 --> 03:10.957
Your visual, olfactory,
and auditory senses

03:11.047 --> 03:15.120
Contribute to your hunting skills
and natural defenses.

03:15.207 --> 03:18.916
I find myself intrigued
by your sub-vocal oscillations,

03:19.007 --> 03:21.521
A singular development
of cat communications

03:21.607 --> 03:24.519
That obviates
your basic hedonistic predilection

03:24.607 --> 03:28.566
For rhythmic stroking of your fur
to demonstrate affection.

03:28.647 --> 03:32.196
A tail is quite essential
for your acrobatic talents,

03:32.287 --> 03:35.438
You would not be so agile
if you lacked its counterbalance.

03:36.167 --> 03:39.284
And when not
being utilized to aid in locomotion,

03:39.367 --> 03:43.155
It often serves to illustrate
the state of your emotion.

03:45.647 --> 03:49.435
Commander,
you have anticipated my denouement.

03:49.527 --> 03:51.802
However,
the sentiment is appreciated.

03:52.087 --> 03:54.806
- I will continue.
- (sighing)

03:55.287 --> 03:59.280
O Spot, the complex levels
of behavior you display

03:59.367 --> 04:02.598
Connote a fairly well-developed
cognitive array.

04:02.687 --> 04:07.636
And though you are not sentient,
Spot, and do not comprehend,

04:07.727 --> 04:12.278
I nonetheless consider you
a true and valued friend.

04:12.367 --> 04:13.846
(snoring)

04:40.207 --> 04:43.358
Space, the final frontier.

04:44.767 --> 04:48.601
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

04:48.687 --> 04:52.885
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

04:53.967 --> 04:57.323
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

04:58.407 --> 05:01.956
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:57.847 --> 06:02.398
I have no problem getting to sleep.
Then I think I'm sleeping all night.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.717
When I wake up, I feel exhausted.

06:04.807 --> 06:07.367
- How long has this gone on?
- Two, three days.

06:08.127 --> 06:10.880
Do you have to hold it that close?

06:11.567 --> 06:16.163
I'm sorry.
I've been on edge all day.

06:17.447 --> 06:21.998
Well, other than
some muscle tension in your neck,

06:22.087 --> 06:25.716
I don't see anything
physically wrong. Any bad dreams?

06:25.807 --> 06:28.367
Not that I remember.

06:28.447 --> 06:31.678
This could be the result
of lack of REM sleep.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.280
What do you recommend?

06:35.327 --> 06:38.205
- Drink this before bed.
- What is it?

06:38.287 --> 06:40.403
A recipe for a warm-milk toddy.

06:41.687 --> 06:44.121
A hot-milk toddy? You're kidding.

06:44.207 --> 06:48.519
The heat activates the amino acids
in the lactose. A natural sedative.

06:48.607 --> 06:51.360
It's a recipe
of the Captain's Aunt Adele.

06:51.447 --> 06:54.359
- It's delicious.
- I'll try anything.

06:54.447 --> 06:57.962
If it still bothers you tomorrow,
I'll run further tests.

06:58.047 --> 06:59.321
Thanks.

07:05.127 --> 07:09.439
Everything's in place. Warp-grid
couplers, subspace-field taps.

07:09.527 --> 07:11.245
Alright, let's do it.

07:11.327 --> 07:14.285
Lt Shipley,
initiate warp-power transfer.

07:14.367 --> 07:19.760
Aye, sir. Verifying sensor
calibration. EPS mains stable.

07:19.847 --> 07:23.317
- Sensor array on line.
- Come on, work.

07:26.047 --> 07:30.996
Geordi, active scanner output
has increased by 26 percent.

07:31.087 --> 07:35.319
Inform Astrophysics that the new
La Forge sensor array is on line

07:35.407 --> 07:38.399
- And awaiting major discoveries.
- Yes, sir.

07:39.887 --> 07:43.641
Geordi, may I make
a personal enquiry?

07:44.407 --> 07:48.036
- It concerns my poetry reading.
- Sure. What is it?

07:48.807 --> 07:53.198
I noticed that many spectators seemed
distracted during my presentation.

07:53.287 --> 07:55.084
Was my poetry uninteresting?

07:55.847 --> 07:57.326
(clears throat)

07:57.407 --> 08:03.676
Well, it was very well constructed,
a virtual tribute to form.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.166
Thank you.

08:07.767 --> 08:10.998
- And?
- And what?

08:11.087 --> 08:13.840
Did it evoke an emotional response?

08:15.927 --> 08:17.201
Well...

08:17.287 --> 08:20.802
Your hesitation suggests you
are trying to protect my feelings.

08:20.887 --> 08:24.323
However, since I have none,
I would prefer you to be honest.

08:24.407 --> 08:27.319
An artist's growth depends
upon accurate feedback.

08:30.007 --> 08:33.477
Well, your poems were... clever,
Data.

08:33.567 --> 08:36.558
And your haiku was clever.

08:36.647 --> 08:41.083
And your sonnet was... clever.

08:42.126 --> 08:45.437
But did it evoke
an emotional response?

08:46.007 --> 08:49.363
To be honest, no, I don't think so.

08:51.087 --> 08:53.043
Then I did not succeed.

08:53.127 --> 08:57.678
No, it's not that you didn't succeed.
You accomplished a lot, but...

08:57.767 --> 09:02.204
If you want to touch people,
don't concentrate on rhyme and meter.

09:02.287 --> 09:06.485
Think more about what you want to say
instead of how you're saying it.

09:07.567 --> 09:10.001
(beeping)

09:10.527 --> 09:12.199
It's a power grid warning.

09:12.287 --> 09:15.006
- I read a massive EPS explosion.
- Where?

09:15.087 --> 09:17.317
I am attempting to localize it.

09:17.407 --> 09:21.241
- It is cargo bay four.
- Three people are in there.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.717
Damage control. Medical team
to cargo bay four. Let's go.

09:37.047 --> 09:39.197
The field imbalance has subsided.

09:39.287 --> 09:43.599
There may still be
a residual discharge. Stand clear.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.723
(chatter)

10:00.007 --> 10:01.565
Is there something wrong?

10:03.847 --> 10:06.645
There's no evidence
of an EPS explosion.

10:06.727 --> 10:08.445
The sensors thought there was.

10:08.527 --> 10:13.043
My modification may have caused
a pattern-recognition failure.

10:13.127 --> 10:15.687
- Just a glitch?
- That's my guess.

10:16.527 --> 10:20.918
Let's perform a level-three
diagnostic on the internal sensors.

10:21.007 --> 10:23.646
Make sure
we haven't overlooked anything.

10:23.727 --> 10:27.561
Could we pick this up
in the morning? A fresh start?

10:28.687 --> 10:32.396
Would you do me a favor?
Stop by my quarters, 0700 hours?

10:32.487 --> 10:35.240
- I'm having trouble waking up.
- Sure.

10:35.327 --> 10:36.965
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

11:13.207 --> 11:15.004
- Commander.
- Gordon.

11:28.247 --> 11:31.125
- Who is it?
- It's La Forge.

11:31.687 --> 11:33.166
Come in.

11:35.807 --> 11:39.117
- Good morning.
- Morning? I just went to bed.

11:40.207 --> 11:42.323
Commander, it's 0700 hours.

12:04.727 --> 12:08.606
She said, "If they're not squirming,
we won't eat them."

12:09.887 --> 12:13.084
Ah, Mr Worf, my good Klingon.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.600
Sir, welcome.

12:14.687 --> 12:20.045
What a pleasure it is to have you
back with us again so soon.

12:20.127 --> 12:24.405
So, Lieutenant, haircut today?
Trim your beard?

12:24.487 --> 12:26.796
I would like my hair trimmed.

12:26.887 --> 12:28.843
- A trim.
- Not like last time.

12:28.927 --> 12:34.923
No. Just a little off the top.
I took way too much off last time.

12:39.247 --> 12:42.239
I was just telling my colleague,
Mr Setti,

12:42.327 --> 12:46.115
how thick and luxuriant
Klingon hair is.

12:46.207 --> 12:49.756
It's such a pleasure to cut.
Sometimes, I get carried away.

12:50.407 --> 12:55.037
All those away missions,
the wind and dry air,

12:55.127 --> 12:58.039
the elements
really are harsh on the hair.

12:58.127 --> 13:02.006
I'd like to suggest you start
using a conditioning agent.

13:12.367 --> 13:15.006
I promise,
not too much off the top.

13:30.887 --> 13:34.675
Just before the alarm, we ran
warp power through this junction.

13:34.767 --> 13:38.442
Somehow, it must have tripped
the internal scanners.

13:38.527 --> 13:42.281
- It showed up as an EPS explosion?
- Yes, but why?

13:42.727 --> 13:47.278
I've modified the sensors before.
Nothing like this has ever happened.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.881
We can't waste time
chasing sensor ghosts.

13:49.967 --> 13:53.277
We should keep it off line
until we can get a closer look.

13:53.367 --> 13:54.561
(yawns)

13:54.647 --> 13:57.207
- Excuse me.
- I know the feeling.

13:57.287 --> 14:01.485
It seems like as soon as my head
hits the pillow, it's time to get up.

14:01.567 --> 14:04.081
We could all use
a little shore leave.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.601
- Definitely. Keep me posted.
- Yeah.

14:06.687 --> 14:09.247
Data, could you give me a hand?

14:09.327 --> 14:13.764
I need to run a structural-integrity
scan. I want to make sure...

14:15.847 --> 14:17.360
What is it?

14:20.367 --> 14:24.838
This is the second time today
that my visor has just cut out.

14:26.607 --> 14:28.598
Are you alright, Geordi?

14:30.127 --> 14:31.799
I don't know.

14:31.887 --> 14:37.086
I just got a very weird feeling.
Maybe I should go to sickbay.

14:37.167 --> 14:40.716
- I will run the integrity scan.
- Thanks, Data.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.525
This is curious.

14:48.607 --> 14:52.680
There's a slight bacterial infection
around your neural inputs.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.962
It was interrupting the data stream.

14:55.047 --> 14:57.117
An infection? What from?

14:57.207 --> 15:01.564
It doesn't match
any bacterial strains on record.

15:01.647 --> 15:04.445
I'm going
to have to sterilize the area.

15:05.207 --> 15:08.040
But I need to run
a resonance tissue-scan

15:08.127 --> 15:12.086
to search for signs of additional
infection. Come over here.

15:19.487 --> 15:21.000
Sit down.

15:24.487 --> 15:26.443
Now, come forward.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.839
Now, you're going to need
to hold very still.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.567
- How's it going?
- I just started.

15:44.647 --> 15:46.763
Did you not go to sickbay?

15:46.847 --> 15:49.566
I've been there
for over an hour and a half.

15:49.647 --> 15:52.445
That is not possible.
My chronometer indicates

15:52.527 --> 15:55.564
you have been gone
for one minute, 1 5 seconds.

15:55.647 --> 15:58.366
I'm telling you,
I've been gone for over an hour.

15:58.447 --> 16:00.597
Computer, what is the time, please?

16:00.687 --> 16:03.440
The time is 1 427 hours.

16:04.127 --> 16:08.723
You are correct. 90 minutes, 1 7
seconds have passed since you left.

16:08.807 --> 16:10.479
What have you been doing?

16:11.447 --> 16:14.086
I have no memory of events
during that period.

16:14.167 --> 16:16.681
When we finish,
I'll perform a diagnostic.

16:16.767 --> 16:20.840
You know, first a false EPS
explosion, then my visor cuts out,

16:20.927 --> 16:25.159
now you lose an hour,
all in this cargo bay.

16:25.247 --> 16:28.717
La Forge to Engineering.
Diagnostic team to cargo bay four.

16:28.807 --> 16:30.035
On our way.

16:30.607 --> 16:34.646
Cartography needs a better position
to study cluster FGC-1 3.

16:34.727 --> 16:38.197
Bring us about, heading 1 23,
mark four.

16:38.287 --> 16:40.084
Aye, sir.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.318
Helm won't lock
to those coordinates, sir.

16:44.207 --> 16:47.836
First time navigating
through a globular cluster, Ensign?

16:49.327 --> 16:53.798
You have to compensate for the
gravimetric interference before...

16:59.807 --> 17:02.162
Is there something wrong, sir?

17:05.247 --> 17:06.919
No.

17:09.247 --> 17:13.001
I don't know.
Put us back on our original heading.

17:18.607 --> 17:20.165
Don't tell me...

17:21.887 --> 17:23.684
This can't be right.

17:25.247 --> 17:28.796
Data, come here
and take a look at this, would you?

17:30.567 --> 17:33.764
I think
we have another sensor glitch.

17:33.847 --> 17:35.917
Sensors are functioning normally.

17:36.007 --> 17:39.920
They are detecting a subspace
particle emission within this room.

17:40.007 --> 17:42.521
Within this room? That's impossible.

17:48.727 --> 17:51.560
The emission is emanating
from this direction.

17:55.127 --> 17:56.401
Geordi.

18:15.567 --> 18:18.764
The bulkhead has been altered
on a subatomic level.

18:19.287 --> 18:22.245
The metal is in a state
of quasimolecular flux.

18:22.327 --> 18:25.524
- What's causing it?
- This is where it gets wild.

18:25.607 --> 18:30.078
Behind that panel is a junction
we used to transfer warp power.

18:30.167 --> 18:33.682
We're reading a subspace particle
stream from that junction.

18:33.767 --> 18:37.840
It appears to be composed of
spatially inverted tetryon particles.

18:37.927 --> 18:41.237
We believe they are
from a tertiary subspace manifold.

18:41.327 --> 18:44.046
But I thought that tetryons
were unstable.

18:44.127 --> 18:46.561
We don't understand it either, sir.

18:47.047 --> 18:50.642
Something from deep subspace
can't exist in our universe.

18:50.727 --> 18:51.762
But there it is.

18:52.207 --> 18:55.040
- Does it pose a danger?
- Not unless it spreads.

18:55.127 --> 18:57.641
If it does, we can beam
the bulkhead into space

18:57.727 --> 18:59.718
and erect a force field in its place.

18:59.807 --> 19:02.037
Well, keep that option ready.

19:02.127 --> 19:04.925
In the meantime,
proceed with the analysis.

19:06.127 --> 19:10.086
When I sat at the console,
it was like I'd been trapped.

19:10.407 --> 19:14.036
- I had to get out.
- Was it the console?

19:14.927 --> 19:18.158
No. I felt like I was disconnected.

19:18.247 --> 19:21.842
Like it was something
that I had dreamed.

19:21.927 --> 19:26.045
You're the third person today
with something like this.

19:26.127 --> 19:29.676
An intense, emotional response
provoked by an object.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.883
Did any of them know why?

19:31.967 --> 19:35.004
No, they couldn't explain it
any more than you.

19:35.087 --> 19:37.681
At this point,
I won't say it's coincidence.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.003
Maybe we should all get together.

19:41.407 --> 19:45.480
Talking about it would help you
understand your response.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.276
I'll find out if anyone else
has had these experiences.

20:00.287 --> 20:04.360
Will, you told me you had
an unusual experience at the console.

20:04.447 --> 20:06.199
Why don't you describe it?

20:07.367 --> 20:10.325
It was vague,
the way you recall a dream.

20:10.967 --> 20:13.879
I remember the sensation
of feeling trapped

20:13.967 --> 20:17.118
and something about a smooth surface.

20:17.687 --> 20:22.317
I had a similar response,
but to a pair of scissors.

20:22.407 --> 20:24.796
Have you dreamt about scissors
recently?

20:24.887 --> 20:27.481
I have no distinct memory of it.

20:27.567 --> 20:30.400
When my visor cut out
in the cargo bay,

20:30.487 --> 20:33.877
I had a weird feeling, too,
about a smooth surface.

20:34.687 --> 20:38.566
It was smooth... and cold.

20:39.167 --> 20:43.683
- Yeah, it was cold.
- Yes. Cold.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.679
It was... elevated?

20:47.807 --> 20:52.119
- A platform.
- Right. Like a bench.

20:54.207 --> 20:55.640
Or a table.

20:56.767 --> 21:00.396
It seems you've all had
a similar experience.

21:01.767 --> 21:04.804
Is there anything else you remember,
besides a table?

21:12.727 --> 21:15.366
Maybe we could help ourselves
remember more.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.524
You all remember a table.
Let's start with that.

21:26.607 --> 21:28.882
Computer, show me a table.

21:28.967 --> 21:32.880
There are 5,047 classifications
of tables on file.

21:32.967 --> 21:35.356
Specify design parameters.

21:35.447 --> 21:37.563
Can you be more specific?

21:37.647 --> 21:40.286
You mentioned it was smooth and cold.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.483
Can you remember its shape?

21:42.847 --> 21:45.077
Long. It was long.

21:45.167 --> 21:49.001
Yeah.
And it had a rectangular shape.

21:49.727 --> 21:53.606
Computer, show me a rectangular
conference table.

22:11.167 --> 22:12.998
It's too high.

22:14.127 --> 22:18.245
Computer, reduce the height
of the table by 25 percent.

22:20.607 --> 22:24.122
The table was smaller.
And it was inclined.

22:25.087 --> 22:29.239
Computer, decrease the table's
surface area by 20 percent

22:29.327 --> 22:31.557
and incline the top 1 5 degrees.

22:33.607 --> 22:36.679
No, it wasn't made of wood.

22:36.767 --> 22:39.281
It was smoother. More metallic.

22:39.367 --> 22:41.483
Computer, make this a metal table.

22:43.607 --> 22:45.245
Yeah.

22:46.007 --> 22:48.123
Yeah, that's starting to look right.

22:48.207 --> 22:53.361
Was there anything else in the room?
Furniture? Chairs? A door?

22:54.567 --> 22:58.003
- Other people?
- No, it was dark.

22:59.047 --> 23:03.245
Yes, it was dark.
I couldn't see beyond the table.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.646
Computer,
lower the surrounding light level.

23:11.407 --> 23:16.197
There was a light
right in my face. A bright light.

23:16.287 --> 23:20.246
Computer. Give me a bright light
right above the table.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.758
Specify light source.

23:22.847 --> 23:26.123
I couldn't tell. It was above me.

23:27.127 --> 23:29.004
An overhead lamp.

23:29.247 --> 23:33.035
- Estimated distance of light source.
- I don't know.

23:33.127 --> 23:36.676
It was at least
two or three meters above.

23:40.967 --> 23:42.286
Brighter.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.838
Brighter.

23:52.887 --> 23:56.402
You said you were uneasy
at the conn position.

23:56.487 --> 24:00.480
Yes. I felt trapped by the console.

24:01.967 --> 24:05.596
But it wasn't like this.
There was something else here.

24:07.767 --> 24:09.917
A restraint of some kind?

24:11.527 --> 24:13.563
Yes, there was a restraint.

24:13.647 --> 24:16.844
It was flat and metal.
It was made of metal.

24:18.887 --> 24:21.765
It came down over my legs.

24:23.287 --> 24:27.439
No, no. It was across my chest,
right here.

24:27.527 --> 24:29.040
It was holding you down?

24:29.127 --> 24:32.278
Yes. It was part of a table.
It was right here.

24:34.087 --> 24:38.638
Computer, create a restraining arm

24:38.727 --> 24:42.515
attached to the right side
of the table at midpoint.

24:46.407 --> 24:48.159
Was it like that?

24:49.327 --> 24:52.683
Computer, put controls
on the restraining arm.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.758
A control panel. Lights.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.162
There was something else there.

25:00.687 --> 25:02.962
Over the head of the table.

25:04.527 --> 25:06.722
A metal swing arm.

25:07.407 --> 25:10.285
Computer, create a metal swing arm.

25:10.367 --> 25:13.484
Double-jointed,
total length, one meter.

25:13.887 --> 25:16.481
Connect it to the head of the table.

25:18.927 --> 25:21.805
There was something
attached to it. A tool.

25:22.567 --> 25:24.319
Scissor-like.

25:26.367 --> 25:30.201
Computer, produce a pair of scissors
attached to the armature.

25:33.807 --> 25:37.197
The handle is wrong.
It was not scissors.

25:38.007 --> 25:41.044
Computer, make the handle
a single-piece grip.

25:41.367 --> 25:44.086
Ten centimeters long, solid metal.

25:45.087 --> 25:48.796
Now, make one blade longer,
curved inward.

25:52.047 --> 25:54.083
Give the other a jagged edge.

25:58.647 --> 26:02.606
Alright. You were lying on the table.

26:03.327 --> 26:06.239
You had a bright light
shining in your eyes.

26:08.007 --> 26:13.764
Were there any smells in the room?
Were there any sounds?

26:13.847 --> 26:15.360
Yes.

26:16.327 --> 26:18.283
Yes, there was a sound.

26:20.407 --> 26:24.559
Computer, there were noises
coming from the darkness.

26:24.647 --> 26:26.205
Strange.

26:26.887 --> 26:28.320
Like whispering.

26:29.407 --> 26:30.760
(whispering)

26:30.847 --> 26:32.405
More like clicks.

26:33.447 --> 26:34.926
Clicking sounds.

26:35.407 --> 26:36.806
(sparse clicking)

26:38.087 --> 26:40.362
- Louder.
- (louder clicking)

26:40.447 --> 26:42.324
Faster.

26:42.407 --> 26:44.967
- (clicking accelerates)
- More of them.

26:45.047 --> 26:47.197
(clicking multiplies)

26:47.287 --> 26:49.482
I've been in this room before.

26:50.647 --> 26:52.524
We've all been here before.

27:00.447 --> 27:02.358
Here it is again.

27:03.407 --> 27:06.080
Something has caused high levels
of serotonin

27:06.167 --> 27:08.886
to be produced
in Geordi's visual cortex.

27:08.967 --> 27:12.676
When I examined him, I thought
it was a bacterial infection.

27:12.767 --> 27:15.076
But I find the same thing
in all three.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.806
They all have elevated levels
of serotonin

27:17.887 --> 27:20.003
concentrated in the hippocampus,

27:20.087 --> 27:23.523
which suggests they've been exposed
to a neuro-sedative.

27:23.607 --> 27:27.486
That's not all. I have detected
minute tetryon-particle traces

27:27.567 --> 27:29.319
in their subdermal tissues.

27:29.407 --> 27:33.002
Tetryons? Like the emissions
in the cargo bay.

27:35.567 --> 27:37.876
I have completed my self-diagnostic.

27:37.967 --> 27:42.995
I was not aboard the Enterprise
for 90 minutes, 1 7 seconds yesterday.

27:43.087 --> 27:44.645
Are you sure?

27:44.727 --> 27:48.481
When I am on the ship,
the warp field leaves a signal

27:48.567 --> 27:51.001
on my internal servo-fluid system.

27:51.087 --> 27:54.284
Between the period
of 1 254 to 1 426 hours,

27:54.367 --> 27:56.244
that signature is missing.

27:58.887 --> 28:03.005
Computer, are there any members
of the crew missing?

28:03.087 --> 28:05.647
There are two crew members
unaccounted for.

28:06.527 --> 28:07.880
Identify them.

28:07.967 --> 28:11.516
Lt Edward Hagler
and Ensign Sariel Rager.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.040
When did they leave?

28:13.127 --> 28:16.324
They have not been present
since 2332 hours.

28:17.967 --> 28:21.277
- How did they leave?
- Method of departure unknown.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.006
- Picard to bridge.
- Bridge here.

28:24.087 --> 28:27.397
Raise shields. I want
a level-four security alert.

28:27.487 --> 28:31.321
I need to know if
anyone comes on or off this ship.

28:31.407 --> 28:32.920
Mr La Forge, Mr Data.

28:33.007 --> 28:36.238
I think if we find the source
of those tetryon emissions,

28:36.327 --> 28:38.761
we'll find the missing crew members.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.485
We're on it, sir.

28:41.247 --> 28:42.965
Dr Crusher?

28:48.007 --> 28:50.362
- My God!
- What is it?

28:50.447 --> 28:54.599
It looks as though your arm has been
severed, then reattached.

28:54.687 --> 28:55.722
What?

28:58.087 --> 29:04.720
The skeletal structure in your radius
and ulna is offset by 0.02 microns.

29:04.807 --> 29:08.846
Your arm has been amputated
and surgically reattached.

29:15.727 --> 29:17.843
Any progress with the analysis?

29:17.927 --> 29:19.360
Look at this.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.481
(beeping)

29:36.607 --> 29:39.326
Data, the tetryon emissions
have intensified.

29:39.647 --> 29:45.995
They seem to be focusing
in this direction, coalescing here.

29:46.767 --> 29:49.361
They're reading
as a point of subspace energy.

29:50.287 --> 29:53.962
It appears to be the beginnings
of a spatial rupture.

29:54.047 --> 29:57.562
The tetryon emissions are modulating

29:57.647 --> 30:02.323
in a way that looks like somebody's
controlling the energy.

30:04.127 --> 30:09.565
You know, the signals from the
modifications to the sensor array,

30:09.647 --> 30:12.286
some of them dig deep into subspace.

30:13.287 --> 30:15.642
Maybe they caught
somebody's attention.

30:15.727 --> 30:19.402
At this rate, we will be
in danger of hull breach.

30:19.487 --> 30:22.957
We should surround it
with a subspace containment field.

30:23.047 --> 30:25.277
Other than the tetryon emissions,

30:25.367 --> 30:29.201
our internal sensors
haven't recorded anything unusual.

30:29.287 --> 30:32.040
Initiate a metallurgical analysis
of the hull.

30:32.127 --> 30:34.561
Subspace incursions
may have left a trace.

30:34.647 --> 30:39.516
Captain, sensors indicate Lt Hagler
has returned to the Enterprise.

30:39.607 --> 30:43.885
He is in his quarters,
deck nine, section 1 7.

30:53.207 --> 30:56.597
Computer, emergency entry.
Chief Medical Officer Crusher.

31:07.487 --> 31:12.515
Crusher to sickbay. A plasma-infusion
unit to deck nine, section 1 9.

31:14.247 --> 31:17.000
His blood is turning
into a liquid polymer.

31:27.047 --> 31:29.402
We've set up a containment field,

31:29.487 --> 31:31.876
but the rupture just keeps expanding.

31:31.967 --> 31:35.357
We've got five to six hours
before it breaches the hull.

31:35.447 --> 31:37.961
Can we still beam it into space?

31:38.047 --> 31:42.723
No, sir. The spatial rupture
is creating nucleonic interference.

31:42.807 --> 31:46.083
It is impossible to obtain
a lock on the bulkheads.

31:49.007 --> 31:51.362
Has your analysis suggested any way

31:51.447 --> 31:54.200
in which we might seal this rupture?

31:55.207 --> 32:00.156
We think we can close the rupture
with a coherent graviton pulse.

32:00.247 --> 32:02.124
We have to do that at the source.

32:02.207 --> 32:04.880
- How do we find the source?
- Good question.

32:04.967 --> 32:07.959
The emissions come
from a tertiary subspace domain,

32:08.047 --> 32:10.766
but subspace has
an infinite number of domains.

32:10.847 --> 32:14.123
It's a huge honeycomb
with an infinite number of cells.

32:14.207 --> 32:17.802
We need to isolate the exact cell
these emissions come from.

32:17.887 --> 32:21.846
If someone homed on
to the subspace signals

32:21.927 --> 32:27.479
created by our modified signal array,
could we do the same to them?

32:27.567 --> 32:30.639
Track the tetryon emissions
to their universe?

32:30.727 --> 32:33.366
Tetryon particles
have a random momentum.

32:33.447 --> 32:35.483
Our sensors cannot track them.

32:35.567 --> 32:39.526
Perhaps we could construct
a homing device.

32:39.607 --> 32:41.882
Something
that our sensors could track.

32:41.967 --> 32:45.437
Good idea, but there's no way
to get that device to the source.

32:45.527 --> 32:48.325
Yes, there is. Give it to me.

32:48.407 --> 32:50.796
They've taken me
for the last few nights.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.923
The same thing will happen tonight.

32:53.007 --> 32:56.795
If you had a homing device,
we could track it in subspace.

32:56.887 --> 33:01.438
As soon as they send you back,
we could neutralize the emissions.

33:01.527 --> 33:05.520
If they send him back.
Ensign Rager hasn't been returned.

33:05.607 --> 33:09.202
They're going to take me,
whether I want to go or not.

33:09.287 --> 33:12.563
We could wait as long as possible
for you to be returned.

33:12.647 --> 33:15.559
But when the spatial ruptures
threaten the ship,

33:15.647 --> 33:18.684
then we would have to transmit
that graviton pulse.

33:18.767 --> 33:20.120
Understood.

33:20.207 --> 33:25.281
Perhaps there's a way
that we could give you an advantage.

33:25.367 --> 33:29.679
A way of keeping you conscious
after they've taken you.

33:29.767 --> 33:32.645
Doctor, can you develop
some counteragent

33:32.727 --> 33:36.436
to the neuro-sedative
they have been giving the crew?

33:38.047 --> 33:40.277
I could give you a neuro-stimulant.

33:40.367 --> 33:45.441
The dosage would have to be high to
counteract the effects. It's risky.

33:45.527 --> 33:50.123
- I'm willing to take that risk.
- Make it so.

33:50.207 --> 33:54.086
Mr La Forge,
begin work on that homing device.

33:57.527 --> 34:01.566
This should ward off their
neuro-sedative for about 1 2 hours.

34:01.647 --> 34:03.444
I hope it's enough.

34:03.527 --> 34:07.406
It's gonna have to be.
I can't risk a higher dose.

34:08.527 --> 34:11.996
I've locked this tricorder
into a continuous cycle.

34:12.087 --> 34:14.647
That way, it will keep recording,
open or not.

34:14.726 --> 34:18.242
Hopefully, you can bring back
information about their domain.

34:18.327 --> 34:21.000
We modified an emitter
to transmit a beacon.

34:21.087 --> 34:25.319
When the indicator lights up,
we've locked on to your location.

34:25.407 --> 34:26.806
Understood.

34:45.766 --> 34:47.166
(click)

35:16.967 --> 35:18.366
- (beeping)
- Captain.

35:18.447 --> 35:21.041
Cmdr Riker has been taken
from the Enterprise.

35:29.967 --> 35:31.764
(clicking)

35:45.887 --> 35:47.559
(clicking)

36:40.807 --> 36:42.604
Mr La Forge, report.

36:43.447 --> 36:47.406
I still can't locate the homing
signal in the energy band.

36:47.487 --> 36:50.843
We're extending the scan
to adjacent levels.

36:50.927 --> 36:52.679
Mr Data, your status?

36:52.767 --> 36:55.520
The rupture has expanded
another 4.2 percent.

36:55.607 --> 36:57.120
Without reinforcement,

36:57.207 --> 37:00.677
containment-field integrity
will fail in 1 4 minutes.

37:00.767 --> 37:03.235
Can you divert more power?

37:03.327 --> 37:07.605
I can augment it with
auxiliary power. It won't be much.

37:07.687 --> 37:09.678
- Make it so.
- Aye, sir.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.924
(beeping)

37:50.167 --> 37:54.877
Captain, I've located the homing
signal. Locking on to it now.

37:55.687 --> 37:59.362
It's coming from
a subspace energy level of 16.2keV.

37:59.447 --> 38:01.722
Stand by to initiate
the graviton pulse.

38:01.807 --> 38:04.526
Graviton emitter
is at full power, sir.

38:04.607 --> 38:10.000
- Mr Data, how much time?
- Failure will occur in nine minutes.

38:14.647 --> 38:16.160
(clicking)

38:26.087 --> 38:29.318
The containment field
is beginning to fluctuate.

38:29.407 --> 38:32.399
Failure anticipated
in three minutes, 11 seconds.

38:32.487 --> 38:36.275
We can't afford to wait any longer.
Begin the graviton pulse.

38:37.487 --> 38:39.443
Initiating pulse now.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.001
Data to Engineering.

38:50.087 --> 38:52.521
The graviton pulse
is having an effect.

38:53.247 --> 38:56.000
Tetryon emissions have decreased
by 1 9 percent.

38:58.807 --> 39:01.844
Captain, additional subharmonics
have appeared.

39:01.927 --> 39:04.202
They are reinforcing the emissions.

39:04.287 --> 39:07.279
They appear to be counteracting
the graviton pulse.

39:07.367 --> 39:10.279
The rupture
is beginning to expand again.

39:10.367 --> 39:13.006
Looks like somebody is fighting back.

39:13.087 --> 39:14.884
Can you strengthen the pulse?

39:14.967 --> 39:17.356
I can set up
a random-frequency shift.

39:17.447 --> 39:19.677
If we stop them guessing
our modulation,

39:19.767 --> 39:21.837
they might not be able
to compensate.

39:31.767 --> 39:35.237
Tetryon emissions
continue to increase.

39:35.327 --> 39:36.885
The rupture is expanding.

39:37.247 --> 39:38.760
Hull breach is imminent.

39:38.847 --> 39:42.123
They're reacting faster
than we can shift frequencies.

39:42.207 --> 39:46.246
Shipley, program the emitters
for full spectrum pulse compression.

39:46.327 --> 39:49.125
I want to channel all the energy
into one burst.

39:49.207 --> 39:52.165
- See if they can handle that.
- Ready.

40:06.327 --> 40:11.037
- The rupture is beginning to close.
- Let's hit them again.

40:11.127 --> 40:13.243
- Come on.
- Ready.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.805
(groans)

40:17.887 --> 40:19.764
(clicking)

40:29.007 --> 40:31.077
The rupture is 86 percent closed.

40:31.167 --> 40:34.125
- One more burst should do it.
- Emitters recharging.

41:02.807 --> 41:06.243
Captain's log, stardate 46191.2.

41:06.327 --> 41:09.319
The tetryon emissions
in cargo bay four have ceased.

41:09.407 --> 41:12.604
There have been no
further signs of alien intrusions.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.963
All crew members are safe
and accounted for.

41:16.047 --> 41:19.119
But we are still left
with some unanswered questions.

41:19.207 --> 41:22.995
Based on the information
from Cmdr Riker's tricorder,

41:23.087 --> 41:26.921
the molecular structure
of the aliens is solanagen-based.

41:27.007 --> 41:29.157
They couldn't come into our space

41:29.247 --> 41:31.636
as easily
as they could take us into theirs.

41:31.727 --> 41:35.640
They needed to learn to remodulate
their cellular-energy states.

41:35.727 --> 41:40.005
They created a small pocket
of our universe in their laboratory

41:40.087 --> 41:42.555
to keep those they abducted alive.

41:42.647 --> 41:45.241
Like putting a fish
in a bucket of water.

41:45.327 --> 41:49.843
In cargo bay four, they tried
to create a pocket of their universe.

41:49.927 --> 41:52.395
What can we do to prevent this?

41:53.087 --> 41:56.602
Looks like they found us
through my modified sensor signal.

41:56.687 --> 42:00.157
We should warn all Starfleet ships
not to make that mistake.

42:00.247 --> 42:04.035
Do we know what came through
the rupture before we shut it down?

42:04.647 --> 42:07.559
No, sir. We were unable to track it.

42:07.647 --> 42:09.797
Maybe it was a probe.

42:10.407 --> 42:14.195
Possibly they were simply curious.
Explorers like ourselves.

42:15.647 --> 42:18.719
Ensign Rager and I were lucky
to have escaped.

42:18.807 --> 42:21.002
Lt Hagler's dead.

42:21.087 --> 42:25.797
Whoever it was that sent that thing
was more than simply curious.
