You can speak with specific

[Dar] I'd like to bring you
up to speed on the attack

20:30.375 --> 20:36.000
and a few unfortunate facts
you should be aware of.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.458
The bomber's name
was Sekou Bah,

20:38.458 --> 20:41.542
an American Muslim
of Nigerian descent.

20:41.542 --> 20:42.917
He'd just been released

20:42.917 --> 20:45.208
from the Metropolitan
Detention Center

20:45.208 --> 20:48.041
where he was awaiting trial
on federal terrorism charges.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.667

We had him in custody?

20:50.667 --> 20:53.667
We did.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.375
He was being defended
pro bono

20:55.375 --> 20:57.417
by a non-profit
in Brooklyn.

20:57.417 --> 21:00.500
They got the case thrown out
on procedural grounds.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.917
But there's something
you should know.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.083
I'm afraid one of
our former officers

21:07.083 --> 21:08.458
works at this non-profit

21:08.458 --> 21:10.834

in the case.

21:13.041 --> 21:14.750
We have
no reason to believe

21:14.750 --> 21:16.083
she had any foreknowledge
of the bombing,

21:16.083 --> 21:19.083

21:19.083 --> 21:20.125
In the meantime,

21:20.125 --> 21:21.250
I'm sure
you can understand

21:21.250 --> 21:24.291

to keep your head down.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.375

21:25.375 --> 21:27.667

the blast happened

from your hotel.

he was heading toward me.

his destination.
