must've hit his splenic artery.

12:21.483 --> 12:24.317
We can clamp it,
slow his blood loss.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.486
We should give him something
for the pain first.

12:26.638 --> 12:28.747
Top drawer.
One vial of morphine.

12:28.974 --> 12:31.249
-Stop. Don't sedate him.
-(banging)

12:31.476 --> 12:33.159
-I need you to wake him up.
-What?

12:33.311 --> 12:34.978
Look, you said
he's in security, right?

12:34.996 --> 12:38.072
I need somebody who can tell me
about security protocols here.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.258
Who has keys, what they open
and if we're safe in here.

12:40.409 --> 12:41.818
I've been a doctor here
for a decade.

12:41.836 --> 12:43.595
I can tell you there are
three keys to this room:

12:43.746 --> 12:45.171
mine, the warden's
and the shift commander's.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.747
We're perfectly safe.

12:46.841 --> 12:48.916
The shift commander in the
Lexan booth who let us in here?

12:49.010 --> 12:51.177
DR. COCHRAN:
Yes, the security pod. Why?

12:51.329 --> 12:53.012
-Listen.

to break into the security pod.

to the security pod!

13:10.439 --> 13:12.698
-There's no way they...
-Doc, I have been a firefighter

13:12.851 --> 13:15.276
for nearly three decades,
and trust me when I say

13:15.295 --> 13:16.777
there is not
a locked room anywhere

13:16.797 --> 13:19.613
that the right tools and
enough time can't break open.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.283
Now, please, wake him up.

13:23.528 --> 13:25.637
Should be about half
a mile ahead-- on the right.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.864
Dispatch,
I'm not seeing anything

13:27.957 --> 13:31.034
resembling an ambulance
on this road.

13:31.052 --> 13:32.702
JOSH:
It has to be there.

13:32.795 --> 13:34.037
You just passed it.

13:34.055 --> 13:35.605
What?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.713
I don't know what
you're seeing on your end.

13:43.806 --> 13:45.898
Their transponder is pinging
to your location.

13:46.051 --> 13:49.369
You should be on top
of them right now.

13:51.056 --> 13:53.239
Yeah, about that.

on his own blood?

Buck, hand me
the Yankauer suction tube.

Hey, just make sure
he doesn't die in here.

14:12.001 --> 14:14.001
Suddenly, you care about the guy
you almost beat to death?

14:14.020 --> 14:17.914
Hey, if I wanted this guy dead,
he'd be dead.

14:17.932 --> 14:19.415
I kept him alive.

14:22.103 --> 14:24.112
Now, you do the same.

14:29.594 --> 14:31.536
Warden sent me
their inmate files.

14:31.763 --> 14:33.872
We can't track 'em,
but maybe we can figure out

14:34.099 --> 14:35.598
where they might've gone.

14:35.691 --> 14:37.100
Dominic Gale.

14:37.118 --> 14:38.618
He's not from here.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.937
He got picked up six years ago

14:41.030 --> 14:43.289
on an out-of-state warrant for
a home invasion in Milwaukee.

14:43.441 --> 14:46.292
Six years ago? What's he still
doing in a California prison?

14:46.444 --> 14:49.612
Uh, he killed a fellow prisoner
while awaiting extradition,

14:49.631 --> 14:53.725
so we decided to hang on to him
until after he finishes his 20.

14:53.952 --> 14:55.709
No local ties.
What about the other one?

14:55.803 --> 15:00.123
Mitchell Trent-- he's been
on death row for 18 years.

15:00.216 --> 15:02.233
Uh, triple homicide.

15:02.460 --> 15:06.462
Hmm. And a long-ass list
of prior offenses.

15:06.481 --> 15:10.133
Yeah, dating back
to a sealed juvenile record.

15:10.226 --> 15:12.893
No visitors, no pen pals.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.395
Until last year.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.398
According to this, he started
writing letters to his ex.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.976
-An ex from 18 years ago?
-Mm-hmm.

15:19.994 --> 15:21.586
Savanna Richards.
She testified at his trial.

15:21.737 --> 15:24.589
She was the state's
key witness against him.

15:24.816 --> 15:26.482
-She still local?
-She is.

15:26.575 --> 15:28.409
We need to get her
into protection right now.

that he'd go through

just to settle an old score?

finally boiled over.

That was brave.

35:29.277 --> 35:30.610
I did it for Nolan.

35:30.704 --> 35:34.280
I never wanted him
to be touched by any of this.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.008

Neither did Mitchell.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.118
(groans)

35:39.138 --> 35:43.265
He was watching you for years,
from a distance.

35:44.626 --> 35:46.309
He saw that Nolan
was a good kid.

35:46.461 --> 35:48.887
Mitchell didn't want
to screw him up, too.

35:49.039 --> 35:50.555
He said that?

35:50.707 --> 35:52.524
Right before he...

35:54.227 --> 35:56.153
The last thing he said...

"He can never know it was me."

36:12.896 --> 36:15.230
Well, what exactly
does the law say?

36:15.248 --> 36:16.915
"Death row inmates," right?

36:17.009 --> 36:20.993
I know what you're thinking,
but there is no way, Athena.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.512
The governor is never
going to pardon him

on a specialty.
