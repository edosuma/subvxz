A vision is in my mind
and in my eyes.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.405
It cannot die,
it cannot disappear,

00:29.447 --> 00:31.657
'cause, 'cause it's like energy.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.702
It just... transforms.

00:36.746 --> 00:39.832
And maybe Wolfgang
will come back...

00:39.874 --> 00:42.293
as a ghost of a vision.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.212
Which is the same thing
as a vision.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.591
Hai Lai, do you think it's okay
for me to do the Requiem?

00:48.632 --> 00:50.134
-(phone buzzes)
-Oh, shit. Okay.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.844
I actually do really want
to talk about this,

00:51.886 --> 00:54.805
but I am late for work,
and then I have rehearsal.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.349
-And then I have another work,
-(duck quacking ringtone)

00:57.391 --> 00:59.935
and then another rehearsal,
and, okay, that's ringing.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.812
And it's probably for you,
so why don't you actually

01:01.854 --> 01:03.647
just keep the phone? Just keep
the phone. I won't miss it.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.232
I don't want, uh, I don't want
a telephone, Hai Lai.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.734
HAILEY:
Nobody wants a phone.

01:06.776 --> 01:08.736
If someone feels neglected
in a relationship,

01:08.778 --> 01:10.529
they should say something,
right?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.281
Even if it's in front of
the other person's uncle

01:12.323 --> 01:14.116
-he hasn't seen in eight years.
-Uh, yes.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.951
If you feel neglected, you
should definitely say something,

01:15.993 --> 01:17.536
but just probably not
in front of the uncle.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.415
-What?
-RODRIGO: Guess what.

01:21.457 --> 01:22.416
What?

01:22.458 --> 01:24.168
-Guess what.
-What?!

01:24.210 --> 01:26.045
They're calling you for the
Fukumoto conducting competition.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.338
They want to scout you
next week.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.589
-Oh, my God! What?!
-Yes, I know!

01:28.631 --> 01:30.174
Oh, my God!

01:30.216 --> 01:31.801
You didn't tell me
that you applied.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.052
Why you didn't...?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.178
'Cause I didn't want to jinx it.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.596
Wait, what is it?

01:35.638 --> 01:37.097
It's the biggest
conducting competition

01:37.139 --> 01:39.475
in the world.
This could change her life.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.272
THOMAS:
What does that say?

01:45.314 --> 01:46.524
"FFF."

01:46.565 --> 01:48.192
Yes, FFF.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.444
And why do you think Beethoven
wrote three Fs

01:50.486 --> 01:52.279
into this score, Alan?

01:52.321 --> 01:54.240
Because he wanted it
fortississimo?

01:54.281 --> 01:57.868
Because he wanted to start
a fucking riot.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.204
He wanted to start an outbreak

02:00.246 --> 02:03.374
of joy and terror
and spontaneous copulation.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.543
But of course we can't do that,
can we, now?

02:05.584 --> 02:07.253
No, no, of course we can't.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.339
Because we need a trumpet
section that can blow

02:10.381 --> 02:11.841
-like the fucking apocalypse.
-(motorcycle engine revving)

02:22.017 --> 02:23.394
Thomas?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.645
(engine idling)

02:24.687 --> 02:26.981
Hello. Hi, how you doing?

02:27.022 --> 02:28.774
Um,

02:28.816 --> 02:30.943
I couldn't help noticing that
you have a little problem

02:30.985 --> 02:32.486
with one of your cylinders.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.821
I didn't hear anything.

02:33.863 --> 02:36.782
Well... I have
a highly-trained ear.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.325
-Oh.
-In fact, I used to ride,

02:38.367 --> 02:40.744
you know, with
the Liverpool Black Diamond Club

02:40.786 --> 02:42.413
way back in the '70s.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.248
I had a Vincent Black Shadow.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.499
May I?

02:45.541 --> 02:47.501
Yeah, go ahead.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.920
-(car horns honking)
-MAN: Come on, let's go!

02:49.962 --> 02:52.256
-What the hell?
-Sorry.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.507
We'll just be a moment.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.301
(honking continues)

02:55.342 --> 02:57.011
Here we go, here we go.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.262
-May I?
-Sure.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.638
-(engine revving)
-Oh.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.265
(laughing):
Oh!

03:01.307 --> 03:03.559
Alan!

03:03.601 --> 03:06.520
Fortississimo!
(laughs)

03:06.562 --> 03:08.981
(revving loudly)

03:09.023 --> 03:10.774
I need the strings

03:10.816 --> 03:13.611
to come on back towards
this back wall here.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.779
Good, yes,
just bring your stuff.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.531
Bring it all back. Here we go.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.366
Good, that's it,
that's it, good.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.077
Um, winds, uh, you're okay.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.997
Although you may need earplugs.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.373
Uh, percussion,

03:26.415 --> 03:27.791
you can walk away.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.627
ALAN:
And then what should they do?

03:29.668 --> 03:31.795
Uh, just find anything
to bang on.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.673
You need a sound,
so you got to find it.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.343
Eraseface,
you've brought the beast.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.345
-She has arrived.
-Hey, yeah, so me and the guys,

03:39.386 --> 03:40.721
we rigged up this kind of, like,

03:40.763 --> 03:42.264
-slide whistle thing.
-Ah.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.807
It's not really working,
but when I figure it out,

03:43.849 --> 03:45.643
-it's gonna be awesome.
-HAILEY: Uh,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.144
is this a bad time?

03:47.186 --> 03:48.938
No, not at all, darling!

03:48.979 --> 03:51.023
-(chuckles) -They're scouting me
at my show at Lizzie's.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.359
I can't believe it.
Thank you for making me apply.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.652
-Of course they are.
-(motorcycle engine starting)

03:54.693 --> 03:56.862
-Think bigger, Rutledge,
think bigger. -(engine pops)

03:56.904 --> 03:58.572
-(revving and sputtering)
-Um, yeah.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.575
So, to make it official,
this is not working at all.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.703
Um... but I can figure it out.
It's gonna be great.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.164
Are the players gonna be able
to hear each other over that?

04:07.206 --> 04:09.083
-I have no idea.
-(engine revving)

04:09.124 --> 04:12.002
I just think maybe I'm making
a complete ass of myself.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.754
Oh, well, me, too.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.089
I have four days to prepare
and I'm not even close to ready.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.341
I think we're gonna do the Shaw,

04:17.382 --> 04:18.968
even though
we're still learning it.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.803
-I don't know, we can
discuss it at our lesson. -Hmm.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.097
-I know it's unconventional,
but... -Mm.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.932
Yeah.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.225
What?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.894
Um, I can't really say,
you know.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.480
That's not like you.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.650
Apparently, Bjarne Berggren
had a nervous breakdown.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.360
He chewed his fingernails off.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.028
-Ew.
-So they needed a last-minute

04:38.070 --> 04:40.906
replacement
on the judges' panel.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.199
Oh.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.409
(instruments warming up)

04:43.450 --> 04:45.077
Oh!

04:45.119 --> 04:46.328
So...

04:46.370 --> 04:47.871
-you can't...
-I'm sorry, no.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.540
I'm barred from giving you
any advice.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.791
You're gonna have
to find a new coach.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.334
Do you know anybody?

04:52.376 --> 04:54.294
No, but, uh,
don't get a second-rate hack

04:54.336 --> 04:57.047
and ruin my work. And...

04:57.089 --> 04:59.466
(whispers):
don't use that piece.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.635
I mean, this lot, they're...
"Go fuck yourself

05:01.677 --> 05:03.220
if you're not Brahms classical."

05:03.262 --> 05:05.472
So that's my final word.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.392
Except...

05:08.434 --> 05:10.978
if you blow this chance,

05:11.020 --> 05:12.438
I'm gonna kick your ass.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.691
-Okay, I won't.
-Hmm.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.114
Each of these candidates
has extensive experience

05:22.156 --> 05:24.283
in music education and would be

05:24.324 --> 05:26.326
an extremely capable
music director.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.787
All you have to do is pick one.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.289
You pick one.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.582
-No, you pick one.
-Gloria, you pick one.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.000
No, I picked the last three.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.460
They were all good.
They were really good options.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.420
-Well, you fired them all.
-Oh...

05:36.462 --> 05:38.005
Come on, Rodrigo!

05:41.425 --> 05:43.385
Okay, I... I will pick one.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.097
But I'm not doing
Mozart's Requiem.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.391
I'm not doing it. No.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.642
GLORIA:
Rodrigo, you're doing it.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.935
You're doing it.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.149
Ah.

06:12.498 --> 06:14.583
Yeah. Sí, perdon.
Perdon, perdon, perdon, perdon.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.001
-Maestro?
-Yes.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.003
Ms. Windsor said to tell
you she's on a tight schedule.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.297
Okay, um, Sharon, could you...?

06:21.840 --> 06:24.843
Um... can you help me
get something

06:24.885 --> 06:29.306
that Mozart touched, like a,
like a toothbrush?

06:29.348 --> 06:30.766
I'm sure I can help you
with that.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.142
Ay, thank you, thank you
so much, thank you.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.270
I just wanted to
let you know that...

06:35.312 --> 06:37.815
whatever feelings I've had
for you are over,

06:37.856 --> 06:40.275
and, um, I'm ready to pursue

06:40.317 --> 06:43.112
a purely
professional relationship.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.613
No.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.864
Okay, okay, that's fine.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.241
Help me with the mofongos.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.867
-Yes. -Yes?
-(plates clatter)

06:48.909 --> 06:50.744
Thank you... okay, thank you.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.663
And, Gloria?

06:52.704 --> 06:54.915
I was thinking,
how about the Fauré's Requiem?

06:54.957 --> 06:56.875
It's a good one, no?
It's just a requiem.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.961
He said he wants Mozart.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.587
That's the only thing he wants.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.131
Excuse me.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.423
I'm the musical director,
you know? So, in a way,

07:03.465 --> 07:04.842
I can choose whatever I want.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.010
Are you all right? Because
you don't seem like yourself.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.679
I'm fine, I'm fine.
What-what do I look like?

07:08.720 --> 07:09.930
You look tired.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.182
And... a little nervous.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.101
Yes, I am nervous, Gloria.
I'm nervous because

07:14.143 --> 07:17.479
you make me do these things
all the time.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.606
Fuck! I feel trapped,
I feel completely trapped!

07:19.648 --> 07:21.441
Okay, okay, now, listen, listen,
I'm gonna try something.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.943
So asphyxiated!

07:22.985 --> 07:25.445
I'm going to treat you
like an adult.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.030
Yes, because I am an adult,
Gloria.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.282
I'm an adult.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.285
You did this. You, okay?

07:31.326 --> 07:32.870
You wanted a youth orchestra.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.247
I said it wasn't the right time,
but you went ahead.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.750
Fukumoto is a godsend for us.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.752
The youth orchestra,

07:40.794 --> 07:42.462
the building, our future.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.215
He makes everything easy.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.925
Yes, Gloria, I want to do things
the easy way.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.343
The only thing is that
I don't know

07:48.385 --> 07:50.012
what is happening
in my head right now.

07:50.053 --> 07:54.349
I believe you're the greatest
conductor alive today.

07:54.391 --> 07:58.395
-And I believe you can lift
this city up. -Hmm.

07:58.437 --> 08:01.273
Lift the kids up.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.649
Same way

08:02.691 --> 08:06.445
Maestro Rivera lifted you up.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.696
So...

08:07.738 --> 08:10.407
don't let us down.

08:10.449 --> 08:14.203
Me, or him, or them.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.872
Yes.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.876
Hey, uh, did you pick one?

08:20.918 --> 08:23.128
-♪ ♪
-Yes.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.755
I pick you, Cynthia.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.798
-Oh, no. -I pick you.
-Oh, no, no, she's off the menu.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.217
-You're the best. -I'm leaving.
-No, she's not.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.468
-I'm gonna go see if...
-Tell him! -No, Gloria.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.428
-Maestro? I found something.
-No.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.096
Some...

08:33.138 --> 08:36.892
(classical music playing)

08:36.933 --> 08:39.519
(song ends)

08:39.561 --> 08:40.895
Okay.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.357
So, the Leonarda,
it's very beautiful.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.525
A little slow, but I like
that it's an obscure

08:45.567 --> 08:47.778
baroque female composer;
that might surprise the judges.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.112
-Cool.
-Totally.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.031
But just to play out
the other option, the Berlioz,

08:51.073 --> 08:52.950
it's more down-the-middle
programing-wise,

08:52.991 --> 08:55.118
but it's more
of a showpiece, so...

08:55.160 --> 08:57.079
-Yeah. -Totally, yeah.
-Awesome.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.455
Are you guys just agreeing
with everything that I say?

08:58.497 --> 09:00.582

It's called a Gunpowder Plot.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.216

Wow.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.843

09:19.268 --> 09:20.978
Two of them are already

09:21.019 --> 09:23.146
and one of them is
conducting Stravinsky

09:23.188 --> 09:25.899
in the Himalayas, so I'm fucked.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.443
-You have other options, Hail.
-Have you even been listening

09:28.485 --> 09:29.736
to anything that
I've been saying

09:29.778 --> 09:31.238
over the past three months?
I'm...

09:31.280 --> 09:32.239
BOTH: ...trying to stay out
of his orbit.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.740
Yes, I have heard you.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.909
I know the words to the song.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.911
But are you really gonna
sacrifice your chance

09:37.953 --> 09:40.372
to be in the Olympics because
you don't want people

09:40.414 --> 09:41.665

for taking his advice?

other people think,

09:42.708 --> 09:43.875

what do you think about

09:50.590 --> 09:52.009

beautiful piece.

-Why not? Yes.
-Yeah.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.930
'Cause she's thinking
about changing it.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.181
Well, you can change it,
you can do

09:58.223 --> 09:59.516
whatever you want--
of course, yes.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.643
-Wait. What?
-Hai Lai,

10:01.685 --> 10:02.686

May I say that I have been

I can show them to you,
but that's all.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.995
I hope it won't come to blows.

the tailpipes tuned to A-flat,

13:09.372 --> 13:10.999

14:06.012 --> 14:07.722
People find out that
I have acquired

14:07.764 --> 14:10.183
their leave-behinds,
and they want them back.

14:10.225 --> 14:13.019
Yours I procured merely
as speculation.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.814
Who knows if they'll ever
really be of any value?

14:15.855 --> 14:16.898
What do you mean?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.275
Well, what I mean to say
is that

14:18.316 --> 14:19.818
I would be willing
to strike a bargain.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.278
How much did you pay
for my maté?

14:21.319 --> 14:22.737

we're here right now.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.239

important than the Pope?

14:28.451 --> 14:29.536

14:31.413 --> 14:32.872
Good. I recommend it.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.166

actually there,

15:29.012 --> 15:31.097

when you first touch it.

I've listened to over 100

17:39.350 --> 17:40.935
of your pieces
back in high school and...

17:40.977 --> 17:42.896
MARIA ANNA:
She wrote hundreds more.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.481
Of course, they were
never published.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.399
Is that a, uh...

17:46.441 --> 17:48.985
My baton, yeah.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.738
Batons came into style
when I was a child,

17:51.780 --> 17:53.865
but, of course,
I could never have one,

17:53.907 --> 17:56.117
so I made it myself.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.702
Just to dream.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.370
So, what are you doing here,
Fraulein?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.706
Wandering around
this dusty manse.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.958
Well, I'm um...
I'm actually being scouted

18:04.000 --> 18:05.335
for a conducting competition,

18:05.376 --> 18:06.461
and I'm trying
to pick my music.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.462
They let you conduct?

18:07.504 --> 18:08.755
They let you compete?

18:08.797 --> 18:10.882
Tell us everything.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.636
Mozart's death mask.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.055
-Made an hour after he passed.
-Hmm.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.723
I acquired it

18:18.765 --> 18:23.853
from the Austrian National
Library in 1991.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.272
And these.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.441
Pages from the Requiem.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.985
Most of the beginning
was completed, of course,

18:31.027 --> 18:35.657
but then it fades away
and simply ends.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.076
As did he.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.912
Can I borrow them?

18:40.954 --> 18:41.996
(laughs)

18:42.038 --> 18:44.624
You are a ballsy little turnip.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.043
Please. Please, there-there's
this woman in the Bronx

18:47.085 --> 18:49.212
that told me that I have
to bring her something

18:49.254 --> 18:51.214
that-that Mozart touched.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.424
She can bring him back to me.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.301
Oh, my dear boy.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.471
You don't need
a woman in the Bronx.

18:58.513 --> 19:01.349
You are speaking to the master.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.980
Hey.

19:07.021 --> 19:10.441
Can you tie me up in back?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.485
HAILEY:
Well, there's the Berlioz,

19:12.527 --> 19:14.571
-which is a little safer.
-FANNY: Safer?

19:14.612 --> 19:17.824
If you think riding on the wings
of the Devil is safe.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.993
Well, but there's also
the Caroline Shaw piece,

19:20.034 --> 19:22.412
and she's into
all sorts of weird shit,

19:22.453 --> 19:25.039
like Tuvan throat singing
or little janky bells

19:25.081 --> 19:26.457
from the hardware store,

19:26.499 --> 19:28.835
-or-or flowerpots, or...
-Flowerpots?

19:28.877 --> 19:30.211
Was ist das?

19:30.253 --> 19:31.838
The blumen pots.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.883
-Ah. -I thought you were
going to do my piece.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.343
The "Vivace." I was so happy.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.430
It hasn't been done
in over 300 years.

19:40.471 --> 19:44.267
Uh, well, I-I just need
to consider all of my options.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.603
Isabella's piece is too tame.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.147
Tame? I was a rebel for my time.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.732
You are already a woman.

19:50.773 --> 19:52.191
You are already different.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.903
Pick the piece that will
make you acceptable.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.487
And win,

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
for those of us
who never got the chance.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.034
Tell me more about
this, uh, Caroline Shaw.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.245
Okay, well, the piece that
she gave me is called "Hi."

20:04.287 --> 20:07.582
And it's about how she wishes we
could all say hi to each other

20:07.624 --> 20:10.251
with total explosive joy
and realness,

20:10.293 --> 20:13.671
like a volcano of-of happiness
and sorrow, or like a spaceship,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.715
but I guess you guys
don't actually know

20:15.757 --> 20:17.008
what a spaceship is,
but like a spaceship

20:17.050 --> 20:18.301
that you would take
to the stars,

20:18.343 --> 20:21.179
and from there,
you can see everything.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.265
Look at how your face changes
when you talk about it.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.018
I'm just tired of doing things
that are acceptable.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.436
I want to do something else.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.188
MARIA ANNA:
This competition.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.400
Yeah, whether you win or lose,
that is not in your hands.

20:34.442 --> 20:38.237
Play the music that will
change them forever.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.239
I like that.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.325
I think mine would be
a good compromise to play.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.078
-Don't... you think so?
-Mm-mm.

20:46.663 --> 20:47.914
My baton.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.290
Take it.

20:49.332 --> 20:50.458
No. Fanny, I can't do that.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.918
MARIA ANNA:
Why?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.003
He won't miss it.
He never comes in here.

20:54.045 --> 20:58.341
He's not interested because
we cannot make him the money.

20:58.383 --> 21:01.427
Take it, Fraulein. For luck.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.471
-Take it. -MARIA ANNA: Take it.
-FANNY: Take it.

21:03.513 --> 21:04.597
-Take it.
-Take it. -Take it.

21:04.639 --> 21:07.016
(repeating):
Take it.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.143
(cello playing)

21:13.690 --> 21:17.026
This is how Gesualdo spoke
to the spirits.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.237
Wearing an amulet.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.449
Conduit between the worlds
of the living and the dead.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.493
♪ ♪

21:29.205 --> 21:34.752

encased in a book of magic.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.796
(orchestra playing)

21:47.682 --> 21:49.726
Let's begin.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.274
(motorcycle revving)

22:22.341 --> 22:24.135
Holy shit.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.387
I really don't know
which one is hotter right now.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.024
(music stops)

22:38.066 --> 22:40.068

22:42.361 --> 22:44.739
RODRIGO:
Wolfgang?

22:44.781 --> 22:46.783
Gesualdo?

22:48.826 --> 22:50.495
Norton Morton?

22:50.536 --> 22:51.871
Morton?

22:51.913 --> 22:53.581
MORTON:
He's nearby.

22:53.623 --> 22:56.084
But I'm having trouble
making the connection.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.127
(shrieks)

22:58.169 --> 23:00.338
Ask him.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.341
Why doesn't he want me
to do the Requiem?

23:03.382 --> 23:07.929
Because you never
listened to him,

23:07.970 --> 23:10.556
you traitor.

23:10.598 --> 23:13.101
I tell you, he's an asshole.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.310
He's an asshole.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.770
(gasping)

23:15.812 --> 23:18.189
He says,

23:18.231 --> 23:20.983
"If you think I'm an asshole,

23:21.025 --> 23:24.695
wait until you meet
the other guy."

23:24.737 --> 23:26.697
What other guy?

23:26.739 --> 23:29.826
(sighs)

23:29.867 --> 23:32.829
And he's gone. Wow.

23:32.870 --> 23:36.040
They kind of have
to want to talk to you.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.709
It's a seduction, really.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.088
Wh-What other guy?

23:42.130 --> 23:44.549
-So, Glo, tell me the truth.
-(Gloria laughs)

23:44.590 --> 23:46.300
-What do you think?
-Oh, what can I say?

23:46.342 --> 23:49.262
It was wonderful
and totally surprising.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.390
I-- you know, I-I didn't know
what to expect next.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.683
-Mm.
-Which is great.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.810
-You hated it.
-No, not at all.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.603
-Not at all. No, no...
-Yes, you did.

23:57.645 --> 23:58.980
-No, no, no, no.
-You hated it.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.565
I'm still just processing.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.774
-You have to give me a moment...
-Okay.

24:02.859 --> 24:06.195
(crickets chirping)

24:06.237 --> 24:09.157
Did you get what you need?

24:09.198 --> 24:11.534
No.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.578
I don't think so.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.040
I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

24:18.082 --> 24:22.295
and say that I think Mozart,

24:22.336 --> 24:24.297
or whatever,

24:24.338 --> 24:26.340
it's a part of you.

24:28.301 --> 24:32.388
You're worried about doing
the Requiem for other reasons.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.932
Your maestro died.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.393
You didn't get to go
to the funeral.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.438
Yeah.

24:43.399 --> 24:45.401
You're very kind to me.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.988
Everyone's kind to you.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.574
No, not the way you are.

24:51.616 --> 24:54.827
Listen, Thomas can't help me.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.287
Why?

24:56.329 --> 24:59.290
He's a judge in the competition.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.376
So I was wondering

25:02.418 --> 25:05.880
if maybe you could help me
get ready.

25:05.922 --> 25:08.758
M-Me? Like, the coach?

25:08.799 --> 25:10.176
And the boyfriend?

25:10.218 --> 25:12.094
Yeah. We'll get you
different hats,

25:12.136 --> 25:14.305
so we can tell
the difference. But, yeah.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.725
Okay, yeah, but i-isn't that
too much in the orbit?

25:17.767 --> 25:21.229
Well, I think it's you
coming into my orbit.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.232
Okay, I like that. Yes.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.525
Also, I'm gonna do the Shaw.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.694
-The Shaw?
-And if it's too out there,

25:28.736 --> 25:30.529
-then I'm too out there.
-Of course, Hai Lai, no.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.531
The Shaw is-is really good.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.533
Yeah.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.952
Yeah, yeah.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.995

25:47.004 --> 25:49.006

25:51.092 --> 25:53.094

Where's Wolfgang?

26:29.255 --> 26:30.798
Gone.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.216
And good riddance.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.094

nothing in common.

26:35.136 --> 26:36.762

No, no.

-No.
