00:01.752 --> 00:04.171
Previously on 90210...
You and Silver are having
a baby together?

00:04.212 --> 00:05.172
Kind of hard to explain.

00:05.213 --> 00:06.966
I think this is something
we need to talk about.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.926
You think just because
you cheated on me
that you'll be able

00:08.968 --> 00:10.970
to walk out on our
new company? You
signed a contract.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.387
I own you.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.806
ANNIE:
We graduated two years ago.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.349
So what if I thought
I'd be completing

00:15.390 --> 00:17.351
a prestigious theater program
by now? I'm not a loser

00:17.392 --> 00:18.560
because I haven't done that.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.896
Cousin Emily?
Surprise!

00:20.938 --> 00:23.064
My agent thought it would be
perfect fodder for my blog.

00:23.106 --> 00:28.320
You have an agent and a
press tour and a blog. Wow.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.322
The first time Patterson
whisked me away in a helicopter

00:30.364 --> 00:32.198
for a private picnic, I knew

00:32.240 --> 00:34.451
love had a price.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.286
A girl came in, talking
about her dad, and I realized

00:36.328 --> 00:38.288
that her dad
is the random trucker.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.165
I just wanted to scream
at her and be like,

00:40.207 --> 00:42.710
"Your dad ruined my life."

00:42.751 --> 00:45.212
About your dad, there's
something you need to know.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.714
He shouldn't blame himself.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.382
It was an accident.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.176
They voted to fire me.
Bryce convinced the
new board of directors

00:51.218 --> 00:53.637
that the company
had outgrown me.

00:53.679 --> 00:54.972
You're the one who hired her.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.097
Actually, that was you.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.307
ASHLEY:
Liam, I get paid

00:57.349 --> 00:58.684
to protect you so you can have

00:58.726 --> 01:00.268
some semblance of a normal life.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.436
I'm sorry, I just

01:01.478 --> 01:02.604
keep feeling like
someone's lurking around,

01:02.646 --> 01:03.605
ready to pounce.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.190
Who are you really hiding from?

01:05.232 --> 01:06.233
Vanessa.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.651
She's dead.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.571
It was an accident;
I was sure that no one knew.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.823
I guess someone's been
watching me for months.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.588
I wish I could get into
the holiday spirit,

01:27.629 --> 01:29.130
but I never thought my husband

01:29.172 --> 01:30.632
would be facing the
specter of unemployment.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.634
Ah, I mean, I knew
Max lost his job,

01:32.676 --> 01:35.136
but I didn't think that
meant you had money trouble.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.346
Money trouble?

01:36.388 --> 01:37.806
Good God, no.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.601
Ever since Bryce
had the board fire Max,

01:40.642 --> 01:42.227
he's depressed
and it's all my fault.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.145
You couldn't have known
she was gonna do that.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.230
How is it your fault?

01:45.272 --> 01:46.523
It's Naomi Clark's
fault because she

01:46.565 --> 01:47.900
controls the fate
of all mankind.

01:47.942 --> 01:51.445
You laugh, but that is
exactly how it feels.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.780
I am gonna have to buy a hell

01:52.821 --> 01:54.573
of a Christmas present
to make this up to Max.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.825
You're not the only one
who doesn't know what to buy.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.911
Why did I think it was a good
idea to start dating Riley

01:58.953 --> 01:59.954
right before Christmas?

01:59.995 --> 02:01.872
Ouch. Rookie mistake.
Exactly.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.707
I mean, I feel like
we're going somewhere,

02:03.749 --> 02:05.333
but I'm not sure where yet.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.877
I want to get something
that says,

02:06.919 --> 02:08.377
"I want to see what happens,

02:08.419 --> 02:10.130
even if I end up
going away somewhere."

02:10.170 --> 02:11.966
Going away?

02:12.007 --> 02:13.467
Where are you going?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.969
Thinking of going.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.971
There's this writing program
in Scotland.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.222
If I apply for a degree,
I'll be there two years.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.808
I didn't even know
you wanted to write.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.517
Yeah.
I didn't either.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.478
I... I mean, then I did.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.521
And I do. I do.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.316
Can you tell that I don't know
how I feel about my writing yet?

02:29.357 --> 02:31.359
Oh,

02:31.401 --> 02:32.820
look at these little onesies.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.989
Now I know what
I'm gonna get you for Christmas.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.949
No. No, please don't.
I don't want to jinx it.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.408
I'm finally almost there.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.911
All that's left is for Teddy
to sign the release.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.747
I thought Teddy did all
the necessary releasing.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.499
This is for
after the baby is born.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.625
Which we've
already talked about.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.543
I'll do everything,
I'll be the parent.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.295
The clinic needs it
in writing

02:50.337 --> 02:51.630
before they'll do
the IVF transfer.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.673
Well, it's a good thing

02:52.714 --> 02:54.173
Teddy's still in town.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.510
Yeah, so he signs the papers,

02:56.551 --> 02:59.596
defrost the embryos,
pop them in the oven,

02:59.638 --> 03:01.015
and merry Christmas.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.223
(laughter)

03:03.684 --> 03:06.687
Oh, do you think Max
would want one of those?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.943
Christmas used to be so much
more fun back in the day.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.529
Seriously, all you would
need is some colored paper,

03:15.570 --> 03:17.823
slap some paste on it, write
"Merry Christmas, Mom and Dad,"

03:17.865 --> 03:19.198
and you'd be done.
Yeah,

03:19.240 --> 03:22.119
when did that stop working
for you? When you were ten?

03:22.161 --> 03:24.121
Okay, I'm just saying.
You're just saying

03:24.163 --> 03:26.123
that you didn't get off your
butt and get anybody a gift

03:26.165 --> 03:27.833
and now you're
sweating it, right?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.835
So who's on your list?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.879
Um, Megan, Navid...

03:31.920 --> 03:33.130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.297
You said Megan?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.341
Megan as in the cute
group therapy girl, Megan?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.218
Wow.
You didn't waste any time

03:38.259 --> 03:40.387
crying over Adrianna, did you?

03:40.428 --> 03:42.556
Time out, she's just a friend,
all right?

03:42.597 --> 03:44.432
If you were still with Ade
and you got Megan a gift,

03:44.474 --> 03:45.684
then yeah,
you guys are just friends,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.477
but if you're single
and you get Megan a gift then...

03:47.519 --> 03:48.645
Okay,

03:48.687 --> 03:50.397
look, you and Annie
are more than friends.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.565
So what did you get her?

03:51.606 --> 03:53.108
Well, as it happens,

03:53.150 --> 03:55.027
I got her something
majorly brilliant.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.196
Dodger season tickets.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.280
You're kidding, right?
It's a long time
until summer, right?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.241
Now, what girl wouldn't say,

04:01.282 --> 04:03.326
"Oh, my God, he still wants me
to stick around

04:03.368 --> 04:06.038
all the way until the end
of the World Series?" Right?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.165
I'm about to get lucky,
my friend.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.416
My bad.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.834
That-that's your sister.

04:10.876 --> 04:11.919
Yeah.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.294
All right,
I'm gonna spot you.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.796
THERAPIST:
Hey, Dixon.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.923
Got your final report
from your doctor.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.425
Uh, thank you.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.385
Hey, Riley,

04:20.427 --> 04:22.179
have you given any thought

04:22.221 --> 04:24.139
to Dr. Bronson's
experimental surgery?

04:24.181 --> 04:25.807
I mean, he thinks you're
a perfect candidate.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.726
Yeah, I've thought about it,
but so far,

04:27.768 --> 04:30.896
there's no miracle for a guy
with spinal cord injuries.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.522
And I'm kind of liking
my life too much

04:32.564 --> 04:34.482
right now to add
"maybe possibly die

04:34.524 --> 04:36.484
in experimental surgery"
to my calendar.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.028
So, no, thanks.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.238
I got you. Hey,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.615
if you change your mind,
give the doctor a call.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.326
Oh, thanks, man.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.495
Thanks.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.956
(sighs)

04:48.997 --> 04:50.331
Well?

04:50.373 --> 04:53.043
Well, I know what
I'm getting Annie for Christmas.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.050
(phone chirps)

05:01.802 --> 05:03.971
Not again.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.889
Look at this text
from Dixon.

05:05.931 --> 05:06.974
Hmm?

05:07.015 --> 05:09.268
"Hair UP for publicity
shots tomorrow.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.979
And get some highlights so
you don't look so washed out."

05:12.020 --> 05:13.438
Ever since the breakup,

05:13.480 --> 05:16.608
he's been texting me
these "contractual obligations."

05:16.650 --> 05:19.319
He hates me, not that
he hasn't got a right to.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.613
It's just even harder
with Christmas coming.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.364
Holiday break-ups
are the worst.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.783
I try not to think
about Silver,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.868
but I keep seeing presents
she'd like.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.703
I got Dixon something
three months ago.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.289
One of those die-cast cars

05:30.330 --> 05:31.957
that he collects
and could never find.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.835
I saw it at a flea market,
and I snapped it up.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.004
Do you think I should
even give it to him now?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.880
Maybe it'll be
a good peace offering.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.632
Bring it tomorrow night
and see what happens.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.634
Okay.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.095
Ta-da!

05:51.059 --> 05:52.894
I picked this up
at the Offshore.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.813
Oh, must be from the studio.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.148
They can always sense

05:56.190 --> 05:57.774
when I'm out of processed cheese
and canned snails.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.318
I should set up
some security cameras here

05:59.358 --> 06:01.069
like I did at The Offshore,
don't you think?

06:01.111 --> 06:03.362
You're doing a great job,
but take some time off,

06:03.404 --> 06:05.406
do your Christmas shopping,

06:05.448 --> 06:06.449
see some friends.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.243
Stalkers don't take vacations.
Yeah,

06:08.285 --> 06:10.162
but the only people that know
I'm here are you and Annie.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.746
Speaking of The Offshore,
Navid is throwing

06:11.788 --> 06:12.914
a little Christmas party
tomorrow night.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.041
You should come.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.374
Thanks.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.376
And if anybody bothered you,
I'd be right there, so...

06:17.418 --> 06:18.795
You know,
you don't have to stay.

06:18.837 --> 06:22.007
I'm pretty sure my appliances
aren't going to attack me.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.217
Okay.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.759
I'll just double-check
the back gate.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.712
NAOMI:
Max?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.589
There's a car parked
in the driveway

07:02.630 --> 07:04.925
that's blocking a very
special Christmas present

07:04.966 --> 07:07.010
that Santa got
three speeding tickets

07:07.052 --> 07:08.720
driving home for you.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.265
(gasps)

07:11.306 --> 07:13.392
Alec?

07:19.231 --> 07:22.067
(theme music playing)

07:37.498 --> 07:38.792
You are not welcome here, Alec.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.586
Naomi, I thought twice,
believe me.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.423
But I heard about what happened
to Max and I had to come over.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.507
The past does not matter
when a friend is in trouble.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.052
Now let me apologize for
everything I've done wrong.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.470
I'm here to make it right.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.639
Alec wants us
to start a new company.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.641
We did it once,
we can do it again.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.809
No suits,

07:55.850 --> 07:57.102
no stockholders...

07:57.144 --> 07:58.812
It's an idea.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.315
Out of many possible ideas.

08:01.356 --> 08:04.151
Naomi and I need to talk
about this, Alec.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.485
Of course.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.987
How could you not?

08:10.115 --> 08:13.701
You are not seriously
considering this.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.204
I don't know. It could be a
terrible idea. It could be...

08:17.331 --> 08:19.082
...an okay idea, maybe.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.835
Look, I'd never do
anything to hurt you,

08:21.876 --> 08:24.712
but I-I have to consider
every alternative.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.964
Okay, well, what if Bryce

08:26.006 --> 08:27.715
said she made a mistake,
that she wants you back?

08:27.757 --> 08:30.469
I could talk to her woman
to woman, tell her that
Phenomi-con was my fault.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.886
Okay, I love you,
but can you

08:31.928 --> 08:33.638
do me a favor and
stay out of this?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.765
I have to work it
out for myself.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.142
If that means letting
go of Data Nitrate,

08:37.183 --> 08:38.268
then I'll live with it.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.936
Max, you don't have to.
Naomi?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.520
Please.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.690
Okay?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.988
Hey.
Hey.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.990
Hey, sorry I am so late.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.618
I got halfway here,
and I realized I forgot...

08:55.660 --> 08:56.911
This.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.872
What's this?
Some stupid thing
from the clinic.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.748
You have to sign it,
saying you're not gonna

09:00.790 --> 09:02.083
claim rights as the father,

09:02.125 --> 09:03.335
blah blah blah whatever,

09:03.377 --> 09:05.295
and then they can implant
my two little embryos

09:05.337 --> 09:06.546
and then, maybe...

09:06.587 --> 09:08.298
Teddy, I was shopping
for Christmas gifts this morning

09:08.340 --> 09:10.509
and I thought,

09:10.550 --> 09:14.429
there is nothing that
I could ever give or receive

09:14.471 --> 09:16.223
that could ever match this.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.600
Well, I think I have
an even better gift.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.353
Instead of signing this,

09:21.395 --> 09:24.689
I'd like to be
our child's father.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.652
That's-that's not
what you wanted three days ago.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.571
Silver, I just... I didn't
think this thing through.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.366
There were so many questions
Shane asked

09:34.408 --> 09:35.950
that I wish
I would have asked myself.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.203
I mean, what if we want
to have a family one day?

09:38.245 --> 09:41.915
Our children would have a half
brother or sister out there.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.001
I don't have to be the bad dad
my father was.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.547
So let's all
do this thing together.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.923
(exhales)

09:49.964 --> 09:51.966
Teddy, that's...

09:52.008 --> 09:55.512
that's really sweet,
but it wasn't the plan.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.639
Look, I know this isn't
what you expected.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.560
But just think about it.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.187
I don't want my kid growing up

10:04.229 --> 10:06.356
to think he had a father
who didn't love him

10:06.398 --> 10:08.483
or didn't care.

10:13.654 --> 10:14.864
Oh.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.241
Uh-oh.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.159
Mrs. Clark-Miller.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.953
Miller-Clark, Clara.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.704
Bryce is expecting me.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.872
N-No, she isn't.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.208
Then how fun.
It'll be a surprise.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.543
BRYCE:
You're breaking up with me

10:26.585 --> 10:27.835
over the phone?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.421
Nice of you to tell me now,
Todd.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.880
We were getting married
in two weeks.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.090
Well, how's this for honest?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.925
You laugh like a hyena

10:33.967 --> 10:36.219
and I hate
your stupid leather sofa.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.512
Good-bye!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.309
What are you doing here?

10:42.350 --> 10:45.686
You know,
when I'm yelling at men,

10:45.728 --> 10:48.189
I usually get really,
really thirsty.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.649
There you go, lovely.

10:49.690 --> 10:50.775
Better?

10:50.817 --> 10:51.859
No.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.445
Oh, I know this is painful.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.821
I'm sorry you're hurt.

10:54.862 --> 10:55.822
Oh, cut the crap, Naomi.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.031
What do you want?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.783
I want to tell you
I'm responsible

10:58.825 --> 11:00.160
for you making a
terrible mistake.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.661
If you fired Max because
of Phenomi-con,

11:01.702 --> 11:03.246
it was not his
fault, it was mine.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.914
And you have to
explain to the board...

11:04.956 --> 11:06.749
It's a waste of time.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.835
There's nothing I can do.
Someone was out to get him.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.462
No, that's impossible.
Everyone loves Max.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.339
Oh, why?
Because he's so perfect,

11:12.380 --> 11:13.381
and he's your husband?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.383
I have my own problems
right now,

11:15.425 --> 11:17.302
so go home to your
wonderful, perfect Max

11:17.344 --> 11:19.429
and leave me alone.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.729
ANNIE:
Okay.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.649
It took me a while to find
the exact perfect gift,

11:30.689 --> 11:32.025
but I think I finally did it.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.152
Merry Christmas.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.820
Wow. Whoa.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.988
You got me a Surface?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.282
Yeah.
And it does so much.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.159
That's the e-mail
app right there.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.036
And when we Skype,
you can make it stand up

11:43.077 --> 11:44.371
with the kickstand like that.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.373
See? It'll be like
we're in the same room.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.541
Yeah.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.958
Does it have a touch function?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.751
'Cause I like it much better
when we can do this.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.671
You see?

11:52.711 --> 11:54.839
There are still some things that
the Internet just can't do.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.343
But if someone's away...

11:58.385 --> 12:00.761
You trying to tell me something?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.430
No. Well...

12:02.472 --> 12:04.224
Yeah. Kind of.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.518
There's this writing program
in Scotland,

12:06.560 --> 12:08.395
and I don't even know
if I'll get in,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.397
but if I do,
I'll be there for two years.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.814
And I want to make sure that...

12:11.856 --> 12:13.191
...that we keep in touch.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.401
Yeah.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.904
You know, the usual response

12:17.945 --> 12:19.573
to a Christmas present
is "thank you."

12:19.614 --> 12:20.907
Yeah.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.867
Except this-this isn't...

12:22.909 --> 12:24.994
a Christmas present.
This is a...

12:25.036 --> 12:26.996
"see you later, thanks for
playing" present. Right?

12:27.038 --> 12:28.956
What? No.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.749
Yeah, you know what?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.669
You know what?
Why don't you just...

12:32.711 --> 12:34.629
take the gift back, give
it to somebody who cares.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.090
Why are you being so mean?
Because, Annie,

12:37.131 --> 12:39.384
you and this-this gift...

12:39.426 --> 12:41.052
Of Skype?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.388
You know what?

12:44.389 --> 12:46.433
This is a waste of time.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.894
So this guy I wrote to
about a job

12:49.936 --> 12:51.896
just invited me to a big gamer
conference this week in Iceland.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.690
Iceland.
Yeah.

12:53.732 --> 12:54.691
Fun.

12:54.733 --> 12:55.900
Let's not rush into anything

12:55.942 --> 12:58.570
until we consider
all of our options.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.364
Well, so far my
only other option

13:01.406 --> 13:03.116
is that maybe Alec's right.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.578
We should go back to
square one and start over.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.371
Or you could see
if something happens

13:08.413 --> 13:10.540
that means you don't have
to start over with Alec...

13:10.582 --> 13:11.916
or go to Iceland.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.418
Naomi.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.002
I told you,
don't try to fix this.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.713
NAVID:
Hey.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.299
Oh, hey, Max.
Hey.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.341
Uh, Naomi.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.593
Navid, what a surprise.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.219
What? You asked me over.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.596
(laughs)

13:24.638 --> 13:27.014
I never asked you over.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.516
But since you're here,

13:28.558 --> 13:30.351
actually, I need to talk to him.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.436
I'll be right back.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.354
Sure. I'm gonna...

13:33.396 --> 13:35.482
listen to some Bjork.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.613
I need you to help me
get Max's job back.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.074
By going on a date
with... her.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.493
That doesn't make it...

13:46.534 --> 13:48.244
Oh. Wow. She's pretty.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.996
Wait. Bryce Woodbridge?

13:50.037 --> 13:51.706
Isn't she the ballbuster
that fired Max?

13:51.748 --> 13:53.750
"Ballbuster" is
an offensive phrase

13:53.792 --> 13:55.585
used to denigrate
successful women.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.295
And yes, she absolutely is.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.631
She also happens to be
vulnerable and lonely

13:59.673 --> 14:01.048
and just updated her status
to "single,"

14:01.090 --> 14:02.509
so I want you to
go out with her.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.594
I don't even
know her.
Yes, you do.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.137
I created a business
page for you.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.055
You sent her a message
and asked

14:08.097 --> 14:10.141
if she'd like
to go out for drinks.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.267
Um, occupation--

14:11.309 --> 14:12.686
"Small business CEO."

14:12.727 --> 14:14.729
You are running the Offshore.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.190
"Interests include
computer coding, solving

14:17.231 --> 14:18.983
difficult mathematical
brain teasers."

14:19.025 --> 14:21.068
Okay, I had the lowest
math AP score at Princeton.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.612
She'll figure that
out in five seconds.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.697
She won't care.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.657
She just got dumped
by her fiancé

14:25.699 --> 14:26.907
two weeks before their wedding.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.702
She is open to going out with

14:28.743 --> 14:31.245
vaguely acceptable men...
no offense.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.164
Yeah, none taken, uh,
but what does this have

14:33.206 --> 14:34.415
to do with Max's job?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.125
Bryce was telling me.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.252
Apparently, someone
was out to get Max

14:38.294 --> 14:40.213
when he was running
Data Nitrate.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.632
I tried to ask her who,
but she's so angry and bitter

14:42.674 --> 14:44.925
about all the men in the world
that she wouldn't tell me.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.136
And I was just thinking,

14:47.178 --> 14:48.805
you could take her out,
charm her.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.223
Maybe she'll tell you
what happened.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.809
Did I mention she's on
the rebound and very hot?
Yeah.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.686
Look, I'd really like
to help you with this,

14:54.728 --> 14:56.688
and yeah, maybe I'm a
little lonely myself.
Mm-hmm.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.898
Uh, but I really need to get
this Christmas party together,

14:58.939 --> 15:00.149
and it's harder
than I thought.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.275
I can't even
get any drinks.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.819
The distributors sold out
weeks ago.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.029
I know a guy who has a warehouse
in Bellflower.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.740
Really? No. Thank you so much.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.783
What...?
Ah, ah, ah.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.411
I do for you, you do for me.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.747
There's an e-mail
in your inbox from Bryce.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.623
Drinks tomorrow evening.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.375
Have fun.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.422
(footsteps approaching)

15:22.463 --> 15:24.340
(door closes, Annie sighs)

15:24.382 --> 15:26.926
What if you give somebody
a really cool Christmas gift,

15:26.967 --> 15:28.720
and they just start
yelling at you?

15:28.762 --> 15:30.054
Is this about Riley?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.472
I know he's not

15:31.514 --> 15:33.433
your typical guy,
but I gave him a Surface tablet

15:33.474 --> 15:34.642
so that we can keep in touch

15:34.684 --> 15:36.394
when I go to this writing
program in Scotland.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.645
Did you happen
to mention Scotland

15:37.687 --> 15:39.146
before or after
you gave him the gift?

15:39.188 --> 15:41.982
Sort of... during? (laughs)

15:42.024 --> 15:43.276
And he got mad?
Mm.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.695
Hmm. It's kind of like the time
that I told you

15:45.737 --> 15:48.489
I was going to go work on
a fishing boat after high school

15:48.531 --> 15:50.950
instead of going to college,
and you got upset with me.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.827
Okay, you were talking
about leaving for

15:52.869 --> 15:54.662
a really long time,
and it was like I wasn't

15:54.704 --> 15:56.664
even a part of the decision.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.165
Ugh.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.876
Mystery solved.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.670
Oy.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.464
How much do you think
I can get for my bike?

16:04.505 --> 16:06.883
Why are you selling your bike?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.968
(sighs)

16:15.349 --> 16:17.226
Oh, no.
Now this creep wants money?

16:17.268 --> 16:18.394
Where did you find this?

16:18.436 --> 16:21.188
It was delivered to the
Offshore in a gift basket.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.941
From?
From the studio.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.276
But anybody could have put
a note in there.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.988
Now I got to get this money
together.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.323
Have you told Ashley about this?

16:30.364 --> 16:32.158
Ashley's the police.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.452
She thinks my problem is
some random paparazzo

16:34.494 --> 16:36.704
or a crazy stalker,
which maybe it is,

16:36.746 --> 16:38.623
but I can't tell Ashley
about Vanessa.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.667
I'll give you the money.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.627
What? No.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.880
Uh, it's my money.
I can use it however I want to.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.007
Don't bother arguing. Just

16:48.048 --> 16:51.177
take the money and use it
to find out who is behind this.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.720
Or I could take the money
and make the drop,

16:52.762 --> 16:54.054
and then beat the crap
out of him.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.849
Liam, make the drop.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.224
I'll videotape
the whole thing.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.060
It's the only way
to find out who's doing this.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.819
Oh, my God.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.299
(sighs)

17:36.138 --> 17:37.264
(electrical hiss, Naomi gasps)

17:37.306 --> 17:38.432
Oh.
Hey.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.767
Max said
you were here.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.852
This is great.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.061
Uh.
I brought Rudolph.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.270
It's your turn.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.605
(screams)

17:44.647 --> 17:46.190
Oh, my gosh,
how many years

17:46.232 --> 17:48.150
have we been passing
this back and forth?

17:48.192 --> 17:50.611
Uh, since we were young enough
to fight over it.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.779
(laughs)

17:51.821 --> 17:53.364
You know what?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.282
When the baby is born,

17:55.324 --> 17:58.912
I think Rudolph here will
get his forever-home with you.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.330
Well, it's not "when."
It's "if."

18:01.372 --> 18:03.541
Teddy won't sign the release.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.418
He wants to be the father.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.003
Not the sperm-donor father.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.296
He wants to be
the father father.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.965
Teddy would make a
great dad. Shane, too.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.009
Oh, my God, I wish
I had two gay dads

18:13.051 --> 18:15.094
who loved me to pieces
and then could tell me

18:15.135 --> 18:17.055
when my dress and my bags
were too matchy-matchy.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
They're not like that.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.557
My gay dads would be.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.559
This is serious, Naomi.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.394
What would this mean?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.564
Well, it would mean
you have to share.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.899
(sighs)

18:27.941 --> 18:29.149
Nobody wants to share.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.027
I don't want to
share Max with Alec.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.195
We didn't want to share
Rudolph the Reindeer.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.656
Sharing a kid with someone
you don't live with is like...

18:35.698 --> 18:37.992
It's like being divorced
without ever getting married.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.078
It's not like there isn't
an upside to joint custody.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.621
When I was taking
care of Jacques,

18:41.662 --> 18:43.414
I couldn't just
leave dry cat food out

18:43.456 --> 18:45.083
and fly off to Aspen
for the weekend.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.167
I had to watch that
nanny like a hawk.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.335
(sighs)

18:48.377 --> 18:49.378
And the downside?

18:49.420 --> 18:52.256
We both know the downside, Sil.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.010
It sucked
when my parents split up.

18:59.430 --> 19:02.141
Didn't feel like I got two homes
and two families.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.102
It felt like...

19:04.143 --> 19:05.812
I had none.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.564
I hated being stuck
in the middle.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.608
I hated it.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.234
Especially during the holidays.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.613
And Teddy and Shane live
all the way in D.C.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.531
Who knows where
I'm gonna end up?

19:17.573 --> 19:22.495
What if I just don't want
to put my kid through all that?

19:22.536 --> 19:25.372
You have to tell Teddy
he can't be involved.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.125
(sighs)

19:27.166 --> 19:30.003
He doesn't want to make the
same mistake his parents did,

19:30.044 --> 19:31.462
but neither do you.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.093
Here you go-- your coffees.
No, I'll get this. Here.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.386
No, no, no, you don't
have to pay for mine.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.263
Consider it my
Christmas gift to you.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.640
Merry Christmas.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.433
(laughs)
Okay.

19:44.475 --> 19:47.561
I mean, that's like, uh,
just the perfect Christmas gift.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.938
(laughter)

19:48.980 --> 19:50.815
Actually, uh, speaking
about Christmas, my...

19:50.857 --> 19:53.776
uh, my friends--
they're throwing a party,

19:53.818 --> 19:56.195
and, uh, I would love
for you to come.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.613
I mean, with-with... with me.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.365
You know, I could
show you around

19:59.406 --> 20:00.658
and introduce
you to people.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.368
Yeah. I can't.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.163
I'm sorry. I mean, thank you.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.081
It was really nice
of you to ask, but...

20:07.123 --> 20:09.208
No, I-I get it.
You know, it's, um...

20:09.249 --> 20:12.712
I guess I shouldn't have assumed
that since you got me a coffee,

20:12.753 --> 20:14.588
that we'd be spending
Christmas together.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.423
No. It's not that. It...

20:16.465 --> 20:20.594
It's just, this is the first
Christmas since the accident.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.763
It's really weird
without my dad.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.474
Yeah. Yeah, I'm...

20:25.516 --> 20:27.518
I'm sorry, Megan.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.645
No, it's not your fault.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.190
It's just,
there are so many things

20:32.272 --> 20:35.109
this time of year that remind me
of what I've lost.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.529
Whatever I do
to feel better, it just...

20:38.571 --> 20:40.614
it's still there,

20:40.656 --> 20:43.034
like a big hand
squeezing my heart.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.495
He's never coming back.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.752
I'm sorry.
You didn't even know my dad.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.088
Uh... no. Um...

20:55.129 --> 20:57.215
I understand.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.635
I really do.

21:12.563 --> 21:13.856
(sighs)

21:13.898 --> 21:16.067
Hey, Ashley.
Have you seen Liam?

21:16.109 --> 21:17.317
No. He just took off.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.238
He said he had some top secret
Christmas shopping to do,

21:20.279 --> 21:21.363
so I couldn't come.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.783
Can you tell him
that I saw Vanessa,

21:23.824 --> 21:25.576
and she's back in town?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.369
Vanessa?

21:27.411 --> 21:29.038
The Vanessa he was engaged to?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.957
He told you about her?

21:30.998 --> 21:33.960
No, but it's my job
to know about these things.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.545
Okay, well, then you know
that she's totally crazy.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.714
She's this con artist,
and she lied to him,

21:38.756 --> 21:40.800
and did a lot of other
really bizarre stuff,

21:40.841 --> 21:43.261
and then robs him blind
and left.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.971
Nobody could believe it
when they actually

21:45.012 --> 21:46.388
got back together
and got engaged.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.183
Then suddenly,
she disappeared, thank God,

21:49.225 --> 21:50.350
but now she's back.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.145
Are you sure it was Vanessa?

21:52.186 --> 21:53.896
I only saw her for a second

21:53.938 --> 21:56.274
at the hair salon,
but when I snuck a look

21:56.315 --> 21:58.400
at the appointment book, the
name said "Elizabeth McManus."

21:58.442 --> 22:00.945
Annie found, like, ten
I.D. cards in her purse once,

22:00.987 --> 22:02.738
and that was one of the names.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.949
(ringtone plays)

22:04.991 --> 22:06.492
Uh!

22:06.533 --> 22:08.202
Dixon again.

22:08.244 --> 22:12.456
Apparently, my highlights are
too subtle.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.584
Can you please just warn Liam
for me?

22:15.626 --> 22:17.795
Of course.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.131
Thanks.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.841
Adrianna,
can you do me

22:21.882 --> 22:24.718
a favor and not
mention this to anyone else?

22:24.760 --> 22:28.806
I want to keep tabs on Vanessa,
and I don't want her tipped off.

22:28.848 --> 22:29.849
Exes can be dangerous.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.310
Yeah, for sure.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.820
(doorbell rings)

22:42.862 --> 22:44.238
What's up?

22:44.280 --> 22:47.825
So what's this about
you not coming to the
Christmas party?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.368
I'm not in the mood for a party.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.538
I had a fight with your sister.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.414
So? Everybody fights
with my sister.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.625
Join the club.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.794
Just, uh, put on
some decent clothes.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.129
Stop being a baby.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.052
Hey, um, remember when you said

23:06.093 --> 23:09.138
I probably don't look at Megan
as just a friend?

23:09.180 --> 23:12.683
So now you're realizing that you
don't think of Megan

23:12.725 --> 23:14.643
as just a friend. Okay.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.229
What's she think of you as?

23:16.270 --> 23:19.690
Maybe she's thinking of me
as more than a friend as well.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.693
Except she doesn't know
that I was in the accident

23:22.735 --> 23:23.861
that killed her dad.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.529
Good move.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.573
Yeah. Save some surprises
for the wedding night.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.117
I didn't tell her because I
didn't want to upset her, okay?

23:30.159 --> 23:32.078
I didn't even know that
we were gonna be friends.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.913
Now there's like a big wall up
between us

23:33.954 --> 23:35.164
that she doesn't
even know about.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.457
So tear down that wall,
Mr. Gorbachev.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.044
Look, you need to tell her
as soon as possible.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.087
Like at the party tonight.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.339
Well, luckily,
she won't be there.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.341
So I got to go hang out
with Annie,

23:45.383 --> 23:46.884
but you don't have
to face a girl

23:46.926 --> 23:48.219
that you're not even mad at?
Nice.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.762
Dude, what are you
so jacked up about?

23:49.803 --> 23:50.888
Annie got you a freaking tablet.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.182
It's not about the gift.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.559
The first thing that went
through Annie's mind when

23:55.601 --> 23:57.186
this Scotland thing came up was,

23:57.228 --> 23:59.105
was that we should
keep in touch.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.606
Yeah, so?

24:00.647 --> 24:02.440
Because she doesn't think
that I can go.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.610
Look, dude,
you don't know that, right?

24:04.651 --> 24:06.195
This whole wheelchair thing,
this isn't new to me.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.654
I act like it doesn't
change anything,

24:07.696 --> 24:08.948
but I know that it does.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.366
You know, eventually
she's either gonna feel

24:10.408 --> 24:11.575
like she can't take
this on anymore

24:11.617 --> 24:13.577
or that I'm holding her back.
Stop.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.122
Stop! You're having this whole
conversation with yourself.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.082
Okay, look, if
you're worried,

24:18.124 --> 24:21.335
why not just tell her, huh?
See what happens?

24:21.377 --> 24:23.796
Why don't you tell Megan
about the accident?

24:27.883 --> 24:31.511
It must be hard
running a business
like Data Nitrate,

24:31.553 --> 24:33.847
lots of people wanting
lots of things.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.099
(both laugh)

24:35.141 --> 24:37.559
It has its ups and downs,
that's for sure.
Yeah.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.186
It's nice
to get out, though.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.478
Yeah, isn't it?

24:40.520 --> 24:43.565
Well, what are some
of the ups and downs?

24:43.607 --> 24:46.819
Like, going to the board
to get someone hired or fired

24:46.860 --> 24:49.405
because of something someone
else said about somebody?

24:49.447 --> 24:53.617
Uh, I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.078
Yeah, me neither.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.830
Hey, do you want
fried calamari?

24:57.871 --> 24:59.915
I hear it's
really good.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.499
If you're hungry.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.086
Okay, maybe we'll pass
the fried. That's fine.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.755
No, I'm sorry. It was

25:06.797 --> 25:08.757
just the appletinis.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.301
I just broke up with my fiancé,

25:10.343 --> 25:12.219
and appletinis were
our favorite drink.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.220
It's, it's dumb.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.265
No, it's not. It's Christmas.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.851
I just broke up
with my old girlfriend,

25:18.892 --> 25:22.396
and I'm even over it,
but I still feel pretty awful.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.023
Really? What happened?

25:24.064 --> 25:27.276
Ah, it's a long story.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.653
You want a Cosmo?

25:29.695 --> 25:30.904
Sure.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.242
No, no one in Silicon Valley
will return my calls.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.119
It's like I'm
suddenly a nobody.

25:37.161 --> 25:38.912
Honey, it's the holidays.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.039
Everything's
gonna be fine.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.791
Just let go, and let Naomi.

25:42.833 --> 25:46.253
Hand me some holly
sprigs, please.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.088
You know what? I'm really
not in a party mood.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.215
I'm just gonna head home.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.258
Babe, will you please
stop worrying, okay?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.510
As if I would just stand by

25:52.550 --> 25:54.887
when I know that Bryce
can be convinced.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.305
Bryce?

25:56.347 --> 25:58.516
What are you talking
about? Bryce?

25:58.556 --> 26:02.019
Well, you do want your
job back, don't you?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.645
I didn't want you to interfere.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.272
I know, but...

26:05.314 --> 26:06.357
No, you don't.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.150
If you listened to
me, you might know,

26:08.192 --> 26:11.445
but... that's not
how you do things.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.031
Oh, well, excuse me.

26:14.073 --> 26:17.701
Excuse me for-for-for not
wanting to see you in pain.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.246
Excuse me for wanting to make
your life a little bit better.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.580
Naomi, what you want is to fix

26:22.622 --> 26:24.333
your nice, little
picture of the world,

26:24.375 --> 26:26.919
where-where Naomi Miller-Clark
and-and Max Clark-Miller live

26:26.960 --> 26:29.213
happily ever after
without anyone

26:29.255 --> 26:31.131
or anything that
you don't like.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.299
Wow.
But guess what.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.633
No, Naomi, guess what.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.052
You got your wish.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.720
Because thanks to you
not listening to me,

26:36.762 --> 26:39.432
I-I have nothing
and no one but you.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.269
Oh, that's great, Max.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.897
That's really great!

27:12.590 --> 27:13.882
Ashley?

27:15.134 --> 27:17.094
(sighing)

27:17.136 --> 27:18.929
I thought you were a real cop.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.473
What's wrong?

27:20.514 --> 27:22.141
I need to know
where you're going.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.559
I have to keep you safe.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.102
I'm fine.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.644
Go to the party. Relax.

27:26.686 --> 27:27.980
See you later.

27:28.021 --> 27:28.981
I can't let you do that.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.858
What do you mean you
can't let me do that?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.486
Liam, you need to
tell me the truth.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.737
You work for me. I don't
have to tell you anything.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.864
Actually, I work
for the LAPD,

27:37.906 --> 27:39.533
and you're right, you don't
have to tell me anything.

27:39.575 --> 27:40.951
You have the right
to remain silent...

27:40.993 --> 27:42.119
What are you doing?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.163
You're under arrest.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.043
(chuckling)

27:50.085 --> 27:51.044
Mmm.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.463
So now she's having a baby

27:52.505 --> 27:53.964
with, uh, this gay
friend of ours,

27:54.006 --> 27:55.508
and I-I'm happy for her.

27:55.549 --> 27:58.427
I just, I feel like a dope
for hanging on so long.

27:58.469 --> 28:01.514
Well, I won't be waiting
by the phone for Todd to call.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.223
(glasses clinking)

28:03.265 --> 28:05.309
I wasted two years
on this guy Alec

28:05.351 --> 28:07.478
who never wanted to be
more than friends.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.188
Alec?

28:09.229 --> 28:10.897
Yeah, although maybe
being friends is

28:10.939 --> 28:12.483
the better way to go.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.984
At least Alec got me my job.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.486
H-How did Alec do that?

28:15.528 --> 28:18.238
He told me exactly what
to say in the interview

28:18.280 --> 28:20.407
in order to impress
his former partner.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.909
All I had to do was
promise to fire the guy
once I got the job.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.870
about what you offered,

31:11.911 --> 31:12.996

37:42.594 --> 37:45.638
Th-That's, that's
how I got hurt.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.683
I-I was there when
your dad died.

37:51.561 --> 37:52.604
Look, look, I'm so sorry.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.064
The only reason I
didn't tell you is

37:54.106 --> 37:56.315
'cause I thought
you'd hate me.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.780
Where is this coming from?

38:01.821 --> 38:03.865
No talking.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.453
(knocking)

38:11.206 --> 38:13.750
Whose life are you trying to
ruin, Alec, mine or Max's?

38:13.792 --> 38:14.751
What? Naomi...

38:14.793 --> 38:17.462
I know what you did.

38:17.503 --> 38:18.755
(panting)

38:18.797 --> 38:21.174
You got Bryce her job,
had her fire Max

38:21.216 --> 38:22.300
for what, revenge?

38:22.341 --> 38:24.136
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.763
Oh, spare me the denial
and the lies, please.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.182
You got rid of Madison,
you tried to get rid of me.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.809
When that didn't work,
Alec, you destroyed

38:30.850 --> 38:32.769
the only other thing
that Max really loved--

38:32.811 --> 38:33.812
the company he built.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.856
No, we built-- Max
and I together.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.609
Okay, so, what, if you can't
have him, no one else can?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.569
It's, it's like you, you tried
to get rid of everybody

38:41.611 --> 38:43.947
and everything in his life
except you,

38:43.989 --> 38:45.323
like you're some crazy
ex-girlfriend

38:45.364 --> 38:47.993
or you're in love with him
or... something.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.956
Oh, my God, you are,
aren't you?

38:52.998 --> 38:57.294
Okay, see, now you're
just talking crazy.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.337
Does he know?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.507
Please don't tell him.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.510
(sighs)

39:05.551 --> 39:08.471
I knew he could never be
more than a friend, okay,

39:08.513 --> 39:09.639
but I-I just kept feeling

39:09.681 --> 39:13.392
like he was getting pulled away
from me.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.521
I know what I did was wrong,
but I didn't want to lose him.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.856
(sighs)

39:17.897 --> 39:22.235
So you tried to make things
the way you wanted them.

39:22.277 --> 39:26.281
No matter what Max wanted
or if he got hurt.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.074
I can't expect you
to understand.

39:28.116 --> 39:32.411
No, I understand
all too well.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.955
I did the exact same thing.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.123
Naomi...

39:35.165 --> 39:38.251
(sighs)

39:38.293 --> 39:39.836
I'm not going
to tell Max something

39:39.878 --> 39:42.339
that's going to hurt him, Alec.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.341
I've done enough.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.926
♪ ♪

40:00.565 --> 40:02.608
(sighs)

40:10.075 --> 40:13.953
Riley Wallace for Dr. Bronson.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.455
I've changed my mind.

40:16.497 --> 40:19.417
I'm gonna go through
with the spinal surgery.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.010
Max, we really have to talk.

40:34.724 --> 40:38.061
"Naomi... I have to think.

40:38.103 --> 40:41.273
Went to the gamer conference
in Iceland."

40:42.190 --> 40:44.234
ANNIE:
Liam.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.819
Liam!

40:46.861 --> 40:48.029
He's not here.
Where is he?

40:48.071 --> 40:49.197
Well, he was
running around

40:49.239 --> 40:50.865
with 500 grand
in his backpack.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.243
Maybe he just
took off.

40:53.285 --> 40:54.827
Oh, come on, if I did
something to him,

40:54.869 --> 40:57.247
then why was I there,
waiting for my money?

40:57.289 --> 40:59.082
I don't know, you were the one
who sent him those letters.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.084
You're trying to extort him
for half a million dollars.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.377
How do I know
you didn't hit him

41:02.419 --> 41:03.628
over the head
or something?

41:03.669 --> 41:05.671
I would never hurt
Liam, I loved him,

41:05.713 --> 41:08.258
but if he didn't love me
back, then he needs to pay me

41:08.300 --> 41:10.260
for falling off a balcony
and almost breaking my neck.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.262
Don't you think?

41:12.304 --> 41:15.265
You are
so way beyond crazy.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.100
If you did anything
to him...
Then what?

41:17.142 --> 41:18.559
You'll push me off a cliff?

41:18.601 --> 41:20.812
ANNIE:
I was there to find out
who was trying to rip him off

41:20.853 --> 41:21.771
for half a million dollars.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.317
VANESSA:
Oh, sorry, Nancy Drew.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.068
How much clearer can I be?

41:27.110 --> 41:28.194
I didn't do anything.

41:28.236 --> 41:29.570
ANNIE:
Well, if you didn't do

41:29.612 --> 41:32.240
anything to him, then
where the hell is Liam?

41:32.282 --> 41:35.201
(muffled yelling)
