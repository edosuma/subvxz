02:11.256 --> 02:13.358
- We routinely adjust our interpretation

02:13.358 --> 02:16.008
of events and our scientific theories

02:16.008 --> 02:20.175
to satisfy the dogmatic
requirements of our beliefs.

02:20.498 --> 02:22.336
Our beliefs set the boundaries

02:22.336 --> 02:26.503
and define the limits of our
science, they always have.

02:27.611 --> 02:30.528
True skepticism is open mindedness,

02:32.696 --> 02:36.863
the enemy of dogma. It's
not about your body,

02:37.034 --> 02:38.714
you're consciousness,
that is what you are.

02:38.714 --> 02:40.969
Your consciousness is
already out of your body,

02:40.969 --> 02:43.011
you don't, you don't need
to get out of your body,

02:43.011 --> 02:46.037
you just need to get
into your consciousness.

02:46.037 --> 02:47.969
What do the facts of your life,

02:47.969 --> 02:50.922
the facts of your existence,
and your results say

02:50.922 --> 02:53.763
about the quality of your consciousness,

02:53.763 --> 02:56.720
the effectiveness of your process,

02:56.720 --> 02:59.165
or the size of your picture?

04:08.931 --> 04:12.041
- [Therapist] So how is everything?

04:12.041 --> 04:16.208
- [Ivan] As good as good can
get, given the circumstance.

04:17.303 --> 04:18.678
- [Therapist] Last time we talked a lot

04:18.678 --> 04:21.406
about you wanting to escape.

04:21.406 --> 04:22.823
- Yeah, it's like

04:23.886 --> 04:24.886
a heaviness,

04:26.211 --> 04:27.044
a pressure

04:29.168 --> 04:31.501
from people, just the noise.

04:32.566 --> 04:35.284
- How's the Zyprexa treating you?

04:35.284 --> 04:36.560
- Okay.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.065
- [Therapist] Any weight gain?

04:39.065 --> 04:40.482
- Yeah, a little.

04:41.768 --> 04:43.837
- [Therapist] You look the same to me.

04:43.837 --> 04:46.368
- I win I guess.

04:46.368 --> 04:48.021
- [Therapist] I've been
meaning to ask you,

04:48.021 --> 04:50.007
are you still smoking?

04:50.007 --> 04:51.215
- Yeah.

04:51.215 --> 04:55.108
- You know smoking's bad for you, right?

04:55.108 --> 04:58.789
Let me ask you this, and you
don't have to answer now,

04:58.789 --> 05:01.958
what are you most afraid
of in this moment?

05:01.958 --> 05:05.041
(slow ambient music)

05:05.878 --> 05:07.961
- My mind going, I guess.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.547
Forgetting who I am.

05:13.158 --> 05:15.926
I just miss the time when
this didn't define me,

05:15.926 --> 05:16.926
or define my

05:18.078 --> 05:20.021
fate, I guess.

05:20.021 --> 05:21.845
- That can't be easy.

05:21.845 --> 05:22.845
- Yeah, but.

05:25.668 --> 05:29.195
You know, there are people
suffering all over the place,

05:29.195 --> 05:32.750
and people who have it a
lot worse than I do, so.

05:32.750 --> 05:36.583
- Do you often think
about the pain of others?

05:38.294 --> 05:39.627
- Yeah, I guess.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.408
But having something in common with people

05:46.472 --> 05:48.305
gives me some comfort.

05:49.703 --> 05:52.286
You know, even if that thing is

05:53.908 --> 05:54.741
suffering.

05:58.639 --> 05:59.472
- Dead men.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.250
There's mountains.

06:04.524 --> 06:06.062
Europe has mountains.

06:06.062 --> 06:08.132
(coins clink)

06:08.132 --> 06:09.990
Birds, and flowers.

06:09.990 --> 06:12.816
(coins clink)

06:12.816 --> 06:15.816
We have military industrial complex,

06:17.909 --> 06:19.909
so it all goes to bombs.

06:21.358 --> 06:23.858

06:25.768 --> 06:26.601
Lincoln.

06:28.709 --> 06:29.684
Lincoln.

06:29.684 --> 06:30.851
- Hey, Harold.

06:31.833 --> 06:32.729
How's it going?

06:32.729 --> 06:35.457
- Oh, man, good to see you.

06:35.457 --> 06:37.418
I'm really glad to have you here,

06:37.418 --> 06:38.912
you came all this way for me, man?

06:38.912 --> 06:40.649
- [Ivan] Yeah, not a problem.

06:40.649 --> 06:41.482
- Thank you.

06:41.482 --> 06:43.393
- You want a smoke, I got some.

06:43.393 --> 06:44.476
- Yeah, yeah,

06:45.788 --> 06:47.188
yeah.

06:47.188 --> 06:48.021
Oh, yeah.

06:48.894 --> 06:50.226
These are the ones I've been talking

06:50.226 --> 06:52.706
to him about, man, I kept bringing it up

06:52.706 --> 06:55.753
and, oh, hell, you know how they can be.

06:55.753 --> 06:57.115
- Yeah, I know how they can be.

06:57.115 --> 06:59.674
- Yeah, it's hard, man, it's hard.

06:59.674 --> 07:02.421
It's, uh, nowadays, man, it's just,

07:02.421 --> 07:04.116
it's just hard to tell, right?

07:04.116 --> 07:05.363
- I saw you counting your change,

07:05.363 --> 07:07.420
are you okay money wise?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.087
- Yeah, yeah, no, I.

07:10.485 --> 07:13.819
It's paying the bills,
man, it's paying the bills.

07:13.819 --> 07:15.484
You know, I'm fixing up the house,

07:15.484 --> 07:17.401
I mean, my office, and,

07:18.611 --> 07:20.179
well, shit, you know, it's a lot of work,

07:20.179 --> 07:22.277
it's more shit than I can do, right?

07:22.277 --> 07:23.845
- Yeah, yeah, oh, hey--

07:23.845 --> 07:25.118
- What the fuck?

07:25.118 --> 07:27.257
- They meant to tell you,

07:27.257 --> 07:30.590
they sent me your Christmas bonus early.

07:32.146 --> 07:34.328
- No, that's gonna be a problem, man,

07:34.328 --> 07:37.642
that's not a good investment, no, no.

07:37.642 --> 07:39.975
- Come on, you've earned it.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.515
- Did they tell you that?

07:43.515 --> 07:45.113
- Yeah.

07:45.113 --> 07:48.384
- Yeah, they tell you
this was tracked, man?

07:48.384 --> 07:49.217
- What?

07:49.217 --> 07:51.536
- Yeah, yeah, they gotta
get their cut, man,

07:51.536 --> 07:54.918
and you bring a fucking tracked bill,

07:54.918 --> 07:57.525
no, no, it's okay, man.

07:57.525 --> 08:00.302
Yeah, you take it, it's okay.

08:00.302 --> 08:02.206
You had it before, man, it was no problem,

08:02.206 --> 08:04.374
okay, I just can't take
something like that, that's all.

08:04.374 --> 08:05.607
- Okay.
- Yeah.

08:05.607 --> 08:07.314
- I'll keep it.
- Yeah.

08:07.314 --> 08:09.981
- Hey, what if, what if we just,

08:12.261 --> 08:14.261
that way they can't find us.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.256
(train crossing rings)

08:17.256 --> 08:19.006
- You're one of them.

08:22.351 --> 08:24.494
You're one of them.

08:24.494 --> 08:27.077
(Harold cries)

08:28.806 --> 08:32.972
They're everywhere, man,
there's no stopping them now.

08:33.789 --> 08:34.923
It's over.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.216
It's over.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.140
(bottles clink)

08:39.140 --> 08:42.056
(dissonant orchestral music)

08:42.056 --> 08:43.755
All my work.

08:43.755 --> 08:47.681
(dissonant orchestral music)

08:47.681 --> 08:48.514
For nothing.

08:50.533 --> 08:51.713
For nothing.

08:51.713 --> 08:55.463

08:56.483 --> 08:59.233

09:28.208 --> 09:31.541

10:26.085 --> 10:28.502

10:30.481 --> 10:31.314
(slow rhythmic pulsing)

10:39.548 --> 10:43.131
(Whispers)

10:47.064 --> 10:50.836
- [Woman] Ivan, hey man, you got this?

10:50.836 --> 10:52.636
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

10:52.636 --> 10:55.464
- [Woman] Super small,
iced, leave room for cream.

10:55.464 --> 10:57.189
- Mm, got it.

10:57.189 --> 11:00.605
(overlapping chatter)

11:00.605 --> 11:04.033
(crickets chirp)

11:04.033 --> 11:06.783

11:18.453 --> 11:20.677
(Ivan sighs)

11:20.677 --> 11:23.427
(crickets chirp)

11:28.437 --> 11:29.687
- [Emily] Ivan?

11:31.096 --> 11:32.679
- Holy shit, Emily?

11:34.232 --> 11:35.645
Emily Fisher.

11:35.645 --> 11:36.798
- How are you?

11:36.798 --> 11:40.479
- Not bad, just, yeah,
trying to keep from smoking,

11:40.479 --> 11:44.147
which is hard, 'cause it's the
only thing that gives me joy.

11:44.147 --> 11:46.389
- Okay, well, I had no
idea that you worked here,

11:46.389 --> 11:47.621
I come here all the time.

11:47.621 --> 11:50.964
- Oh, yeah, I work pretty late though, so.

11:50.964 --> 11:53.586
During the daylight I'm
trying to get my master's.

11:53.586 --> 11:54.419
- Oh, yeah,

11:54.419 --> 11:57.028
I guess undergrad just doesn't
cut it like it used to.

11:57.028 --> 12:00.642
- Exactly, well, Jesus, how about you?

12:00.642 --> 12:04.168
- Well, I'm also no
stranger to the darkness.

12:04.168 --> 12:07.400
- That's perfect, that's perfect for you.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.722
- I guess, thank you, no, I'm
actually headed there now,

12:10.722 --> 12:13.492
so I wanted to get something
to help me keep my eyes open.

12:13.492 --> 12:15.049
- Oh, yeah, don't let me hold you up.

12:15.049 --> 12:16.290
- No, no, no, will you be here in like,

12:16.290 --> 12:18.262
three minutes, and I'll
catch you on my way out?

12:18.262 --> 12:19.275
- Yeah, I'll be here.

12:19.275 --> 12:20.108
- Okay.

12:20.108 --> 12:23.441
(slow electronic music)

12:37.392 --> 12:38.225
- Hey,

12:39.723 --> 12:41.806
so I'm off tomorrow, and.

12:43.445 --> 12:46.445
I know we're both tired and old-ish,

12:47.522 --> 12:51.689
would you maybe want to
grab a drink sometime?

12:51.706 --> 12:55.205
Not now, obviously, but at sometime soon?

12:55.205 --> 12:56.846
- I, uh,

12:56.846 --> 12:58.139
yeah,

12:58.139 --> 12:59.203
yes.

12:59.203 --> 13:00.617
Yes.

13:00.617 --> 13:02.031
- Yeah.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.066
- For sure.

13:03.066 --> 13:04.399
- Alright, here.

13:06.609 --> 13:08.337
This is my number.

13:08.337 --> 13:10.984
(slow electronic music)

13:10.984 --> 13:13.784
How about you pick a place and a time

13:13.784 --> 13:16.069
and text me, and I'll meet you there?

13:16.069 --> 13:17.424
- Yeah, I can do that.

13:17.424 --> 13:19.832
(slow electronic music)

13:19.832 --> 13:22.005
- Did I just ask you out?

13:22.005 --> 13:24.034
- Yeah, it felt like it.

13:24.034 --> 13:25.350
- Good.

13:25.350 --> 13:28.683
(slow electronic music)

13:30.446 --> 13:31.872
- Your drink.

13:31.872 --> 13:33.872
- [Emily] Don't need it!

13:34.715 --> 13:37.465
(water splashes)

13:51.334 --> 13:53.917
- Just go, just go, you got it.

13:56.231 --> 13:57.064
Go.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.348
Okay.

13:59.348 --> 14:02.515
(overlapping chatter)

14:04.154 --> 14:06.737
(radio blares)

14:13.851 --> 14:14.684
- Boo.

14:14.684 --> 14:16.164
- Ah, hey.

14:16.164 --> 14:17.997
- Hey, how's it going?

14:19.076 --> 14:20.828
- Good, you?

14:20.828 --> 14:22.388
- Pretty good.

14:22.388 --> 14:23.637
- Hey, what can I get you to drink?

14:23.637 --> 14:24.925
- Is that good?

14:24.925 --> 14:26.991
- Uh, yeah, I'm into it.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.205
- [Emily] Can I have one of those, please?

14:28.205 --> 14:29.038
- [Waitress] Sure.

14:29.038 --> 14:30.246
- Thank you.

14:30.246 --> 14:32.181
This place is great.

14:32.181 --> 14:33.050
- Is it too loud?

14:33.050 --> 14:34.383
- No, it's fine.

14:35.668 --> 14:36.501
So.

14:37.530 --> 14:39.115
Spill it.

14:39.115 --> 14:39.948
- What?

14:39.948 --> 14:41.801
- What have you been doing with your life?

14:41.801 --> 14:43.914
What are you getting your master's in?

14:43.914 --> 14:46.894
- It was physics before, but
then I got into consciousness,

14:46.894 --> 14:49.496
and I'm actually doing
this study right now,

14:49.496 --> 14:53.618
we're exploring out of body experiences.

14:53.618 --> 14:54.451
- No kidding.

14:54.451 --> 14:56.853
- Yeah, yeah, and I get to
be one of the guinea pigs

14:56.853 --> 14:58.826
that tries to have them.

14:58.826 --> 14:59.659
- Dude, that's nuts.

14:59.659 --> 15:01.790
- [Ivan] Yeah, right?

15:01.790 --> 15:03.524
- Have you had one?

15:03.524 --> 15:07.139
- It's, the other people
in the study for sure have.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.357
- We've had people in the hospital

15:08.357 --> 15:11.357
that say that they've left
their body during surgery.

15:11.357 --> 15:12.742
- When they're unconscious?

15:12.742 --> 15:16.240
- Yeah, about two years ago
we had this woman who said

15:16.240 --> 15:18.052
that she saw her husband standing over her

15:18.052 --> 15:20.037
in the OR when she was
under, and this was for,

15:20.037 --> 15:21.942
like, I don't know,
relatively minor thing,

15:21.942 --> 15:24.926
like, she was fine, but her husband went

15:24.926 --> 15:28.088
into cardiac arrest and
died when he was sitting

15:28.088 --> 15:31.997
in the waiting room, and he
never entered the OR once,

15:31.997 --> 15:35.677
and she said that she saw him
standing there the whole time.

15:35.677 --> 15:36.813
- [Ivan] That's incredible.

15:36.813 --> 15:38.242
- I know.

15:38.242 --> 15:40.988
- Well, what do you make of it all?

15:41.105 --> 15:42.521
- I don't know...

15:43.555 --> 15:44.846
coincidence?

15:45.415 --> 15:48.115
Yeah, I'm the worst, I just, I don't know,

15:48.115 --> 15:49.032
I feel like

15:51.054 --> 15:53.392
people dream funny dreams when
they're on anesthetic drugs,

15:53.392 --> 15:55.915
I mean, maybe if they suddenly
spoke a different language

15:55.915 --> 15:57.819
or knew the cure for
cancer, I'd be convinced

15:57.819 --> 16:00.422
that their soul just somehow
magically left their body.

16:00.422 --> 16:03.153
- That's a pretty high
bar to set for evidence.

16:03.153 --> 16:07.320
- Yeah, but I feel like
we set the bar pretty low

16:07.592 --> 16:11.116
when we want something to be true.

16:11.116 --> 16:12.103
- Yeah, I'll give you that.

16:12.103 --> 16:14.623
(Emily laughs)

16:14.623 --> 16:17.886
So that must be tough, your job?

16:17.886 --> 16:21.510
- Just physically, I mean,
helping people is the best,

16:21.510 --> 16:25.222
and if I ever actually, if
I ever actually save a life,

16:25.222 --> 16:27.824
I mean, that's why we do it, right?

16:27.824 --> 16:29.168
(dishes crash)

16:29.168 --> 16:30.582
(people holler)

16:30.582 --> 16:31.415
Oops.

16:37.027 --> 16:38.110
Are you okay?

16:39.066 --> 16:42.452
- Yeah, sorry, I just get
anxious in public spaces,

16:42.452 --> 16:43.285
it's dumb.

16:45.039 --> 16:48.649
(tinnitus ringing)

16:48.649 --> 16:49.926
Sorry, sorry, I hate that.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.426
- Hey, it's okay, you're okay.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.347
You know what?

16:55.347 --> 16:59.514
We can just get out of here,
I will not give a shit, okay?

17:00.296 --> 17:01.560
- Okay.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.664
- Hey, can we get the check, please?

17:04.664 --> 17:05.718
- [Waitress] Yeah, sure, no problem.

17:05.718 --> 17:06.718
- Thank you.

17:07.862 --> 17:08.694
Seriously.

17:10.523 --> 17:11.607
It's just me.

17:12.566 --> 17:13.566
No one else.

17:15.181 --> 17:16.013
You're okay.

17:17.874 --> 17:18.707
- Okay.

17:21.420 --> 17:22.680
- Here you are, no rush.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.240
- [Emily] Perfect timing.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.027
- Wow, that actually helped a bit.

17:28.027 --> 17:29.302
What are you, a hypnotist?

17:29.302 --> 17:30.885
- Yeah, definitely.

17:33.693 --> 17:36.360
Do you want to see my apartment?

17:37.597 --> 17:40.097
(door creaks)

17:43.431 --> 17:45.598
- Wow, your place is nice.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.818
(lighter clicks)

17:52.818 --> 17:55.235
You're a nurse in a hospital.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.568
- [Emily] Want some?

17:59.568 --> 18:01.739
- Yeah, but I probably shouldn't.

18:01.739 --> 18:04.746
- That's not the guy I remember.

18:04.746 --> 18:07.520
- I get too paranoid these days.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.687
Plus, I don't know it'll
affect that research thing.

18:13.636 --> 18:17.492
- It helps me sleep,
takes my mind off shit.

18:17.492 --> 18:20.602
(slow electronic music)

18:20.602 --> 18:23.011
- Until the fear starts to take hold.

18:23.011 --> 18:24.636
(Emily laughs)

18:24.636 --> 18:27.015
(Ivan growls)

18:27.015 --> 18:28.249
(Emily laughs)

18:28.249 --> 18:29.875
I've come for your soul.

18:29.875 --> 18:30.799
- [Emily] Oh, shit.

18:30.799 --> 18:33.543
- [Ivan] Come for your, oh, give it to me,

18:33.543 --> 18:34.376
give me your skin.

18:34.376 --> 18:37.043
(Emily mumbles)

18:37.896 --> 18:38.729
Sorry.

18:38.729 --> 18:41.312
(Emily laughs)

18:43.281 --> 18:45.864
- I have to tell you something,

18:47.998 --> 18:49.998
and it's really bad, and

18:53.029 --> 18:57.029
I feel awful, and you're
probably gonna hate me.

18:57.991 --> 19:00.241
- [Ivan] Jesus, what is it?

19:04.502 --> 19:05.335
- I.

19:07.164 --> 19:08.305
- Come on.

19:08.305 --> 19:09.472
- I'm engaged.

19:10.930 --> 19:13.517
Like, engaged engaged.

19:13.517 --> 19:16.600
(slow ambient music)

19:18.908 --> 19:23.075
I know it wasn't fair for
me not to say anything, but

19:24.258 --> 19:25.508
I just saw you,

19:26.985 --> 19:28.402
and I wanted you.

19:29.885 --> 19:32.058
I wanted you for a long time,

19:32.058 --> 19:35.141
and it just felt like my last chance.

19:38.356 --> 19:42.523
And I just thought that if you
knew, you wouldn't do this.

19:42.570 --> 19:46.129
(slow ambient music)

19:46.129 --> 19:48.829
- I have no problem with it.

19:48.829 --> 19:50.438
- Okay.

19:50.438 --> 19:54.190
- I mean, you didn't
promise me anything, right?

19:54.190 --> 19:55.273
- Yeah, okay.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.663
Are you sure?

19:59.540 --> 20:03.040
(slow ambient music)

20:03.040 --> 20:07.040
Okay, God, it feels good
to get it off my chest.

20:08.472 --> 20:09.472
- Who is he?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.668
- Oh, do you remember John Gardner?

20:16.485 --> 20:17.318
What?

20:19.234 --> 20:20.067
What is it?

20:20.067 --> 20:21.979
- I didn't say anything.

20:21.979 --> 20:23.547
- Fucking face, what?

20:23.547 --> 20:26.836
- No, no, he's a good guy, we were, like,

20:26.836 --> 20:28.867
roommates for a year.

20:28.867 --> 20:32.014
- Fuck (sighs).

20:32.014 --> 20:34.004
I'm so fucking stupid.

20:34.004 --> 20:34.837
- [Ivan] Stop.

20:34.837 --> 20:37.222
- No, I just hate myself
so much right now.

20:37.222 --> 20:40.403
- Look, I felt like if you
were really happy with him,

20:40.403 --> 20:43.278
you wouldn't have fucked
me, let's be honest.

20:43.278 --> 20:44.119
- Shut up.

20:44.119 --> 20:47.179
It's, no, I just, I feel like
I'm on this conveyor belt,

20:47.179 --> 20:49.501
and the path is set, and I cannot stray,

20:49.501 --> 20:52.676
even for a second if I wanted to.

20:52.676 --> 20:55.890
(slow ambient music)

20:55.890 --> 20:58.339
- I heard this saying that a
person who won't leave a room

20:58.339 --> 21:01.557
because they don't know how,
or because they're too afraid

21:01.557 --> 21:05.507
to open the door, they're
trapped, just the same,

21:05.507 --> 21:08.340
whether or not the door is locked.

21:09.259 --> 21:11.458
- I heard a saying once that people

21:11.458 --> 21:14.075
who say sayings are fucking douche bags.

21:14.075 --> 21:16.106
(both laugh)

21:16.106 --> 21:17.760
- Yeah, yeah, I set
myself up for that one.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.340
- Oh, I'm sorry, you
know I'm joking, right?

21:19.340 --> 21:21.745
- Yeah, no, I just won't
ever give you advice again.

21:21.745 --> 21:23.472
(both laugh)

21:23.472 --> 21:25.055
- Oh, I don't know.

21:25.978 --> 21:29.853
John is fine, most of the time,

21:31.727 --> 21:33.394
but he drinks a lot,

21:34.230 --> 21:38.571
and he has cheated on me more than once.

21:40.842 --> 21:41.675
- Well.

21:43.194 --> 21:45.113
Now I like him less.

21:45.113 --> 21:48.360
(slow ambient music)

21:48.360 --> 21:50.181
He's not gonna barge in here, is he?

21:50.181 --> 21:54.348
- No, he's in Germany, or on
his way back from Germany.

21:55.727 --> 21:56.894
- Why Germany?

21:58.471 --> 22:00.289
- 'Cause he's in the army.

22:00.289 --> 22:01.224
- Fuck.

22:01.224 --> 22:02.279
- Yeah.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.931
- Fuck.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.431
Oh, shit, what did we just do?

22:07.507 --> 22:08.638
- I know.

22:08.638 --> 22:12.462
(slow ambient music)

22:12.462 --> 22:14.086
You know what?

22:14.086 --> 22:18.253
No, I feel like every chance
he's had to fuck around,

22:19.155 --> 22:22.322
he has, and every time I stood by him,

22:23.915 --> 22:25.248
so he can either

22:26.551 --> 22:27.718
forgive me, or

22:29.447 --> 22:31.097
leave.

22:31.097 --> 22:34.431
- I'd prefer if he never
found out about this.

22:34.431 --> 22:35.720
- Yeah.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.803
(slow ambient music)

22:40.547 --> 22:44.714
No matter what happens, I'm
really glad that we did this.

22:44.872 --> 22:47.523
(slow ambient music)

22:47.523 --> 22:48.423
- Same.

22:48.423 --> 22:51.051
(slow ambient music)

22:51.051 --> 22:53.551
(birds chirp)

22:59.958 --> 23:03.041
(slow ambient music)

23:03.968 --> 23:06.468
(pen scrawls)

23:10.331 --> 23:13.414
(ambient whispering)

23:17.721 --> 23:19.371
Don't do that.

23:19.371 --> 23:22.454
(slow ambient music)

23:30.497 --> 23:32.997
(birds chirp)

23:35.088 --> 23:37.838
(lighter clicks)

23:41.487 --> 23:44.570
(slow ambient music)

23:47.087 --> 23:49.729
(Ivan sighs)

23:49.729 --> 23:52.812
(slow ambient music)

24:06.601 --> 24:09.851
(slow rhythmic pulses)

24:25.122 --> 24:27.872
(phone vibrates)

24:39.179 --> 24:40.105
Hey.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.272
- [Emily] Hey.

24:43.198 --> 24:44.448
How's it going?

24:46.184 --> 24:47.549
- Good, great.

24:47.549 --> 24:50.361
- [Emily] It was nice
seeing you the other day.

24:50.361 --> 24:52.194
- Yeah, yeah, you too.

24:53.653 --> 24:57.736
- [Emily] Hey, listen,
John wants to talk to you.

24:59.932 --> 25:00.765
- Yeah?

25:04.561 --> 25:06.549
- [John] Hey, brother, long time no see.

25:06.549 --> 25:09.956
- Hey, yeah, yeah, it's been awhile.

25:09.956 --> 25:11.224
- [John] How's everything?

25:11.224 --> 25:13.441
Emily told me she ran into you.

25:13.441 --> 25:16.776
- Yeah, yeah, that, that happened.

25:16.776 --> 25:20.640
(slow orchestral music)

25:20.640 --> 25:22.921
So you two are getting hitched, huh?

25:22.921 --> 25:26.423
- [John] Yeah, bet you never
thought you'd see the day.

25:26.423 --> 25:29.585
Just got back and got
tons of planning to do,

25:29.585 --> 25:32.679
I think today we're doing
the cake tasting thing,

25:32.679 --> 25:35.226
I don't know, but it's not all bad.

25:35.226 --> 25:38.782
- Yeah, who doesn't like cake, so.

25:38.782 --> 25:41.600
Emily told me you were in the army,

25:41.600 --> 25:43.838
and I was like, how did
I not hear about this?

25:43.838 --> 25:48.005
- [John] Yeah, man, we
haven't spoken in forever.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.927
Long enough for me to go to hell and back.

25:49.927 --> 25:50.760
- When did you get back?

25:50.760 --> 25:54.927
- [John] Hey, man, you wanna
come over for a drink tomorrow?

25:57.745 --> 26:00.162
I'd love to swap war stories.

26:02.077 --> 26:04.579
- Uh, yeah, that should work for me.

26:04.579 --> 26:05.746
- [John] Yeah?

26:07.670 --> 26:10.253
- Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

26:11.369 --> 26:13.025
- [John] We can text you the address.

26:13.025 --> 26:15.853
Awesome, alright, I'll see
you then, peace, brother.

26:15.853 --> 26:17.518
- Yeah.

26:17.518 --> 26:20.601
(slow ambient music)

26:38.014 --> 26:40.764
(phone vibrates)

26:57.578 --> 26:58.725
(door creaks)

26:58.983 --> 26:59.816
- Hey.

26:59.825 --> 27:00.658
- [Ivan] Hey.

27:00.658 --> 27:01.519
- What's up, dude?

27:02.569 --> 27:03.609
- Get ready, I'm bringing it in close.

27:03.609 --> 27:04.442
- [Ivan] Hey, John.

27:04.442 --> 27:06.215
- Hey, how's it going?

27:06.215 --> 27:07.048
- [Ivan] Good, good.

27:07.048 --> 27:07.881
- Good seeing you man.

27:07.881 --> 27:08.714
- [Ivan] You too.

27:08.714 --> 27:09.852
- Come on in, let's do this.

27:09.852 --> 27:12.847
(door creaks)

27:12.847 --> 27:13.680
You ate, right?

27:13.680 --> 27:15.678
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

27:15.678 --> 27:19.845
- [Emily] Good, 'cause this is all we got.

27:19.903 --> 27:21.958
- I'm gonna make such a mess (laughs).

27:21.958 --> 27:23.024
- What's new with you?

27:23.024 --> 27:25.040
Em says you're back in school.

27:25.040 --> 27:28.984
- I told you, he's
literally soul searching.

27:28.984 --> 27:31.609
- Yeah, yeah, neuroscience, close enough.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.342
- Yeah, she said you were a
lab rat, what's that about?

27:34.342 --> 27:35.259
- Um, yeah.

27:37.183 --> 27:38.714
I'll just start from the beginning,

27:38.714 --> 27:42.783
a few years back, I saw this
talk at the university given

27:42.783 --> 27:44.825
by this wizard looking dude--

27:44.825 --> 27:46.352
- Like a Gandalf wizard?

27:46.352 --> 27:49.783
- Exactly, total Gandalf, so the talk was

27:49.783 --> 27:52.860
about consciousness and the idea

27:52.860 --> 27:56.261
that reality is all an illusion,

27:56.261 --> 27:59.430
and underneath it all is
this consciousness system

27:59.430 --> 28:00.968
that we're all a part of.

28:00.968 --> 28:05.014
And according to him,
with enough practice,

28:05.014 --> 28:09.181
we can all access this system
through advanced meditation,

28:10.026 --> 28:13.151
so when you hear about
out of body experiences

28:13.151 --> 28:16.215
or astral projection,
it's actually these people

28:16.215 --> 28:18.583
just breaking the
boundaries of the illusion.

28:18.583 --> 28:19.967
- So it's bullshit.

28:19.967 --> 28:21.228
- Maybe.

28:21.228 --> 28:24.293
Or maybe it's hard to
imagine the world is round

28:24.293 --> 28:27.735
if you always thought it was flat.

28:27.735 --> 28:28.568
- Fair.

28:29.867 --> 28:34.034
- So, yeah, now I'm
Gandalf's research buddy.

28:34.220 --> 28:35.706
- I'm so curious to see what you find out,

28:35.706 --> 28:37.718
I mean, this is not my area at all,

28:37.718 --> 28:41.501
but based on my ridiculously
limited background

28:41.501 --> 28:44.034
in medical research, I'm qualified enough

28:44.034 --> 28:45.420
to say that we know almost nothing

28:45.420 --> 28:46.253
about how the brain works.

28:46.253 --> 28:49.110
- No, right, exactly,
and this is weird, too,

28:49.110 --> 28:50.917
there's some evidence that observation

28:50.917 --> 28:54.486
alone can affect things
outside of our mind.

28:54.486 --> 28:56.041
You've heard of the double
slit experiment, right?

28:56.041 --> 28:56.874
- I have.

28:57.930 --> 28:59.778
No, I haven't.

28:59.778 --> 29:01.528
- [Emily] Ignore him.

29:02.656 --> 29:03.622
- Please, educate.

29:03.622 --> 29:06.017
- Okay, the double slit experiment is one

29:06.017 --> 29:09.179
of the most replicated
experiments in physics

29:09.179 --> 29:11.994
because it is so fucking weird.

29:11.994 --> 29:16.000
So you have these two slits,
and behind that is a censor,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.538
like a wall, and if you blast
light through the slits,

29:19.538 --> 29:22.339
a wave pattern is created on the sensor,

29:22.339 --> 29:23.247
which makes sense, right,

29:23.247 --> 29:26.247
because light is like a wave, right?

29:27.267 --> 29:29.073
Okay, so later they figure out how

29:29.073 --> 29:31.823
to fire photons, light particles,

29:32.699 --> 29:34.532
one at a time through the slits,

29:34.532 --> 29:37.449
and they still make a wave pattern.

29:38.299 --> 29:39.289
- Okay.

29:39.289 --> 29:42.872
- Okay, okay, so blast
light, wave pattern,

29:44.399 --> 29:48.566
blast individual photon
particles, still a wave pattern.

29:50.045 --> 29:51.333
It's weird because you'd think

29:51.333 --> 29:55.500
that individual particles
would arrive kind of randomly,

29:55.589 --> 29:58.865
it wouldn't be able to create
the wave pattern one particle

29:58.865 --> 30:02.089
at a time, right, it
just doesn't make sense.

30:02.089 --> 30:05.096
- None of this shit makes any sense.

30:05.096 --> 30:05.929
- Shut up.

30:05.929 --> 30:10.096
- Okay, here's where it
actually gets interesting.

30:10.197 --> 30:11.892
To find out how individual particles

30:11.892 --> 30:15.420
could make wave patterns, they
set up these little detectors

30:15.420 --> 30:17.914
to see the particles
pass through the slits,

30:17.914 --> 30:22.081
and the particles totally
changed their behavior.

30:22.236 --> 30:24.171
The pattern on the sensor just looked

30:24.171 --> 30:26.482
like the particles shot
straight through the slits

30:26.482 --> 30:30.107
in a perfectly straight
line, no more wave pattern.

30:30.107 --> 30:31.689
They thought maybe the placement

30:31.689 --> 30:34.180
of the detectors interfered
with the particles somehow,

30:34.180 --> 30:38.347
so they turned them off,
but kept them in place,

30:38.578 --> 30:42.386
and the particles made
a wave pattern again.

30:42.386 --> 30:45.197
Detectors on, double slit pattern,

30:45.197 --> 30:47.530
detectors off, wave pattern.

30:49.606 --> 30:53.427
So the behavior of the particles depended

30:53.427 --> 30:57.594
on whether or not they were
actually being observed.

30:58.408 --> 30:59.241
- Spooky.

31:00.628 --> 31:01.461
- Wha?

31:01.461 --> 31:03.329
(Emily laughs)

31:03.329 --> 31:05.501
- I swear, every time I see
you I learn something new

31:05.501 --> 31:06.834
and awesome.

31:06.834 --> 31:10.307
- So John, you're a military man now, huh?

31:10.307 --> 31:13.149
How the hell did that happen?

31:13.149 --> 31:13.982
- Yeah.

31:15.671 --> 31:19.028
Sorry, yeah, it never used to
be this hard to talk about.

31:19.028 --> 31:20.695
- You don't have to.

31:22.061 --> 31:23.561
- I will say this.

31:26.372 --> 31:29.251
Being over there really shows
you what we take for granted,

31:29.251 --> 31:31.229
and I feel a lot of guilt about that.

31:31.229 --> 31:32.573
- I get that.

31:32.573 --> 31:34.421
- Seems like our days of
being spoiled are numbered,

31:34.421 --> 31:37.990
though, things aren't
what they used to be.

31:37.990 --> 31:41.268
I mean, there's a lot more
shared poverty nowadays.

31:41.268 --> 31:44.035
- Our system feeds on
poverty, it needs it.

31:44.035 --> 31:47.328
- Yeah, but on the other
hand, I mean, this wine.

31:47.328 --> 31:50.342
There's a heater in
here and a refrigerator.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.722
- And you got that beast of
an internet porn collection,

31:52.722 --> 31:53.913
so there's always that.

31:53.913 --> 31:54.837
- Yes.

31:54.837 --> 31:56.922
- Seriously, it's like a fucking terabyte.

31:56.922 --> 31:57.755
- On that hard drive.

31:57.755 --> 31:58.971
- I'm just saying, ugh.

31:58.971 --> 32:00.719
- Why don't you just stream
it like a normal person?

32:00.719 --> 32:03.661
- What, I am storing
up for the apocalypse.

32:03.661 --> 32:06.828
Got my vintage VHS '90s porn classics.

32:08.281 --> 32:09.234
- What, like Barbara's Bush?

32:09.234 --> 32:10.831
(overlapping chatter)

32:10.831 --> 32:12.664
- And Ghost Thrusters.

32:13.690 --> 32:14.523
Cliff Banger.

32:14.523 --> 32:17.744
(group laughs)

32:17.744 --> 32:18.919
Forrest Hump.

32:18.919 --> 32:22.326
(group laughs)

32:22.326 --> 32:23.743
That's good shit.

32:25.280 --> 32:29.447
Ivan, in a couple weeks I'm
taking this hiking trip,

32:30.741 --> 32:34.908
kind of a last hurrah
before Em and I are trapped

32:35.076 --> 32:38.313
in a boring marriage for
the rest of our lives.

32:38.313 --> 32:40.730
- John wants to go on a vision quest.

32:40.730 --> 32:44.514
- I just want to set
up a tent on the beach

32:44.514 --> 32:46.514
and just feel the quiet.

32:47.945 --> 32:50.308
- I keep telling him that
even after we're married,

32:50.308 --> 32:53.108
he can still go off on a lonely pilgrimage

32:53.108 --> 32:55.979
to the middle of the
woods, but he doesn't get

32:55.979 --> 32:58.876
that I'm not a fucking prison guard, so.

32:58.876 --> 33:01.209
- It's not the same, I just,

33:02.363 --> 33:06.530
I could use a spiritual
guide on my vision quest.

33:07.007 --> 33:08.313
- Oh, wow, man, uh.

33:08.313 --> 33:09.881
- Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean to freak you out,

33:09.881 --> 33:11.962
I know it's, we haven seen
each other in forever,

33:11.962 --> 33:15.579
and, I don't know, I'm
digging the vibe here tonight.

33:15.579 --> 33:17.148
- Um,

33:17.148 --> 33:18.105
yeah.

33:18.105 --> 33:19.671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:19.671 --> 33:20.504
- Seriously?

33:20.504 --> 33:21.337
- [Ivan] Yeah, yeah.

33:21.337 --> 33:22.170
- I mean, it's short notice,

33:22.170 --> 33:23.390
Gandalf's not gonna be pissed, is he?

33:23.390 --> 33:24.710
- No, that's, no, it's fine,

33:24.710 --> 33:26.544
I think that'll actually
be a good place for me

33:26.544 --> 33:30.197
to just unplug and practice
all this voodoo shit.

33:30.197 --> 33:32.873
- Yes, awesome, this is great.

33:32.873 --> 33:35.363
Look, I'll tell you all
about it after I pee,

33:35.363 --> 33:37.184
I'll be right back.

33:37.184 --> 33:40.684
(dissonant ambient music)

33:42.280 --> 33:44.697

(pen scrawls)

36:43.064 --> 36:45.564
(birds chirp)

36:57.425 --> 36:59.176
- [Television] Rain around
the Chicago area today

36:59.176 --> 37:00.517
temperatures are holding at--

37:00.517 --> 37:01.596
- [Ivan] Hey, Mom.

37:01.596 --> 37:04.475
- Hey, where have you been hiding?

37:04.475 --> 37:06.091
I haven't seen you for awhile.

37:06.091 --> 37:07.388
- [Ivan] Yeah, there was no hiding,

37:07.388 --> 37:10.109
I was just at a friend's
place, having a drink.

37:10.109 --> 37:12.963
- You have an appointment
this morning, right?

37:12.963 --> 37:14.630
- [Ivan] Yeah, I do.

37:16.126 --> 37:19.721
- Are you still not taking your pills?

37:19.721 --> 37:22.524
(door slams)

37:22.524 --> 37:25.420
- I can't, I can't handle that stuff.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.949
- I know you don't want to hear this,

37:26.949 --> 37:29.790
but I think that's a bad
idea, your doctor said

37:29.790 --> 37:31.967
that the side effects might
improve it if you just--

37:31.967 --> 37:33.673
- No, Mom, I don't know how
many ways I can tell you

37:33.673 --> 37:36.963
that that stuff makes
me want to kill myself.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.895
Look, I'm honestly
saying I'd rather be dead

37:38.895 --> 37:41.696
than spend the rest of
my life on that shit.

37:41.696 --> 37:45.433
I'd rather be crazy, for that matter.

37:45.433 --> 37:49.240
Look, it's not an easy situation, okay?

37:49.240 --> 37:51.407
But that's just how it is.

37:53.970 --> 37:56.968
- I just don't want to lose my son,

37:56.968 --> 37:58.984
does that make me a crazy person?

37:58.984 --> 38:02.945
- I know you don't, Mom,
but you want your son

38:02.945 --> 38:04.945
to like his life, right?

38:09.202 --> 38:10.202
- Come here.

38:13.686 --> 38:14.519
I do.

38:16.113 --> 38:18.280
I do want you to be happy.

38:20.119 --> 38:21.119
- Thank you.

38:22.699 --> 38:25.484
(door creaks)

38:25.484 --> 38:28.567
(slow ambient music)

38:31.887 --> 38:32.970
Are you okay?

38:35.841 --> 38:37.921
Seriously, are you okay?

38:37.921 --> 38:41.004
(slow ambient music)

38:43.241 --> 38:46.038
- I'm gonna break it off with him.

38:46.038 --> 38:46.977
I think.

38:46.977 --> 38:49.885
(slow ambient music)

38:49.885 --> 38:51.528
- [Ivan] What happened?

38:51.528 --> 38:52.593
- You know what happened.

38:52.593 --> 38:55.010
(door shuts)

38:57.900 --> 38:59.483
What are you doing?

39:00.691 --> 39:02.315
- You, you invited me over.

39:02.315 --> 39:06.482
- No, you idiot, why
are you going with him?

39:06.742 --> 39:09.811
- Look, I know it's weird,
I know how it looks,

39:09.811 --> 39:11.319
it's fucking weird.

39:11.319 --> 39:12.486
- Yeah, it is.

39:15.593 --> 39:17.510
- I have some problems.

39:19.175 --> 39:20.194
Some health problems,

39:20.194 --> 39:23.891
and I think it's a
really good idea if I go.

39:23.891 --> 39:25.124
- What's wrong?

39:25.124 --> 39:26.803
You're sick?

39:26.803 --> 39:28.303
- It's just, it's,

39:29.827 --> 39:32.050
it's just kind of hard to talk about, so.

39:32.050 --> 39:33.550
I, sometimes it's,

39:37.010 --> 39:38.308
can you do me a favor, could we wait

39:38.308 --> 39:41.225
to talk about this when I get back?

39:42.188 --> 39:44.361
I know it's a lot and it's kind

39:44.361 --> 39:46.944
of fucked up for me to do, but.

39:49.089 --> 39:51.988
But I hope you believe me, Emily,

39:51.988 --> 39:55.923
when I say I like you a lot, 'cause I do,

39:55.923 --> 39:59.914
and this trip isn't gonna change that,

39:59.914 --> 40:04.081
and I hope someday you can
understand why I'm going

40:05.416 --> 40:08.920
and maybe forgive me for
fucking you up in the process.

40:08.920 --> 40:12.253
(slow electronic music)

40:13.176 --> 40:15.676
- So is this thing contagious?

40:16.963 --> 40:18.299
- No.

40:18.299 --> 40:21.632
(slow electronic music)

40:26.295 --> 40:29.212
(jet engines roar)

40:34.838 --> 40:38.588
(dissonant orchestral music)

41:02.643 --> 41:05.165
- [John] Oh, one bed, well,

41:05.165 --> 41:08.357
at least it's big enough for both of us.

41:08.357 --> 41:09.599
- [Ivan] I'll take the floor.

41:09.599 --> 41:13.766
- Why, I need to cuddle
and be warm with my baby.

41:14.293 --> 41:15.755
- No, that's fine.
- Gonna snuggle.

41:15.755 --> 41:16.962
- John, John, it's fine, it's fine.

41:16.962 --> 41:18.729
- Alright, no, I got the floor, I insist.

41:18.729 --> 41:21.234
- No, no, no, no, you
brought me out here, so.

41:21.234 --> 41:22.901
- Alright, whatever.

41:24.551 --> 41:28.081
This is great, man, thanks
for coming out with me.

41:28.081 --> 41:29.581
- Yeah, of course.

41:30.431 --> 41:31.764
- You tired yet?

41:32.839 --> 41:33.922
- Not really.

41:51.251 --> 41:54.947
Look, I don't know where
you got this idea from,

41:54.947 --> 41:57.614
no, she's just, she found me, I,

41:59.199 --> 42:02.468
I would never do that, Emily, no.

42:02.468 --> 42:03.645
No, I didn't fuck her.

42:03.645 --> 42:04.728
- Ivan.

42:04.728 --> 42:05.561
- [Ivan] No.

42:05.561 --> 42:06.488
- Ivan.

42:06.488 --> 42:08.280
- [Ivan] Look, I agree, you're a good guy.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.113
- Ivan.

42:09.113 --> 42:10.144
- Yeah, yes?

42:10.144 --> 42:13.715
- [John] You're talking in your sleep.

42:13.715 --> 42:14.548
- Really?

42:15.946 --> 42:20.113
- Yeah, you just said you
didn't fuck my fiance.

42:20.451 --> 42:22.245
- I must have, um.

42:22.245 --> 42:26.412
- You dreaming I was
interrogating your or something?

42:26.811 --> 42:28.894
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.

42:30.854 --> 42:32.732
That really didn't just happen?

42:32.732 --> 42:36.899
- No, I've been asleep for
like, an hour and a half.

42:37.852 --> 42:40.949
- Look, I'm sorry, I'm out of it,

42:40.949 --> 42:44.044
I haven't drank that much in awhile.

42:44.044 --> 42:45.794
- It's all good, man.

42:52.388 --> 42:53.221
Dumbass.

42:56.644 --> 42:58.757
- You've been to this spot before?

42:58.757 --> 43:02.072
- Not this exact spot, but
I've heard good things.

43:02.072 --> 43:04.049
- Private beach?

43:04.049 --> 43:06.776
- Not exactly, it's pretty far in,

43:06.776 --> 43:09.100
most people don't hike all the way in.

43:09.100 --> 43:09.933
- Awesome.

43:12.225 --> 43:14.058
- Thank you very much.

43:19.420 --> 43:20.832
What?

43:20.832 --> 43:21.944
- What the fuck was that?

43:21.944 --> 43:22.777
- [John] What?

43:22.777 --> 43:25.001
- That shit eating grin.

43:25.001 --> 43:26.368
- Politeness?

43:26.368 --> 43:27.201
- Right.

43:28.310 --> 43:32.477
- Plus I'm not married yet (chuckles).

43:32.681 --> 43:34.024
What, Jiminy Cricket, what?

43:34.024 --> 43:35.845
- It's just douchey,
man, we used to make fun

43:35.845 --> 43:39.356
of assholes that did shit like that.

43:39.356 --> 43:42.580
- How long have you had a thing for Emily?

43:42.580 --> 43:44.315
Just curious, no big deal.

43:44.315 --> 43:45.323
- That's not what this is.

43:45.323 --> 43:48.334
- Right, you're talking in your sleep,

43:48.334 --> 43:50.899
this weird protection of her,

43:50.899 --> 43:53.374
I get it, it's way fucking obvious.

43:53.374 --> 43:56.089
- Look, I don't want
there to be any bad blood,

43:56.089 --> 43:58.874
there's nothing going on.

43:58.874 --> 43:59.707
- Okay.

44:04.687 --> 44:06.622
- Here, show me on this thing
again where we're going?

44:06.622 --> 44:07.455
- Alright.

44:09.419 --> 44:11.930
So we're gonna, here we are,

44:11.930 --> 44:15.977
follow this ridge down to this area here,

44:15.977 --> 44:18.721
it's pretty steep, we won't
exactly have to rappel

44:18.721 --> 44:21.032
or anything, but it'll be hairy,

44:21.032 --> 44:24.642
then we'll cut over here
about two and a half hours,

44:24.642 --> 44:26.520
and then we'll be at
our home away from home

44:26.520 --> 44:28.032
for the next two weeks.

44:28.032 --> 44:29.570
- Anything out there that can kill us?

44:29.570 --> 44:32.299
- Yeah, being stupid, falling off a cliff.

44:32.299 --> 44:34.584
- What about, like, snakes, or?

44:34.584 --> 44:37.537
- It's bear country, mountain lions,

44:37.537 --> 44:38.728
but if you're loud enough on the trail,

44:38.728 --> 44:40.228
they'll stay away.

44:42.155 --> 44:44.552
The land, though, is
owned by the government,

44:44.552 --> 44:47.385
so if anyone asks, just play dumb.

44:50.795 --> 44:52.054
- That would have been a lot easier

44:52.054 --> 44:54.742
to do before you said anything.

44:54.742 --> 44:56.071
- Sorry.

44:56.071 --> 44:58.612
(Ivan chuckles)

44:58.612 --> 45:02.529
(avant-garde orchestral music)

45:30.378 --> 45:32.467
So if we keep heading west,

45:32.467 --> 45:35.300
we should be in pretty good shape.

45:36.308 --> 45:40.475
Worse comes to worse, my
cellphone's mostly charged.

45:40.789 --> 45:42.352
(Ivan laughs)

45:42.352 --> 45:46.269
(avant-garde orchestral music)

46:02.629 --> 46:06.129
(water trickles)

46:06.129 --> 46:10.046
(avant-garde orchestral music)

47:01.867 --> 47:04.496
(waves crash)

47:04.496 --> 47:07.163
(sand crunches)

47:17.138 --> 47:19.359
What do you think?

47:19.359 --> 47:21.859
(waves crash)

47:26.788 --> 47:27.621
- Awesome.

47:30.350 --> 47:34.267
(avant-garde orchestral music)

48:04.480 --> 48:06.720
I'm gonna pass out.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.887
(avant-garde orchestral music)

48:11.062 --> 48:14.183
- [Ivan] I need a little more this way.

48:14.183 --> 48:18.100
(avant-garde orchestral music)

48:26.305 --> 48:28.433
- [John] Can't believe how many stars.

48:28.433 --> 48:31.100
(fire crackles)

48:32.185 --> 48:36.352
- And this is why the city sucks (laughs).

48:36.792 --> 48:40.125
- Yeah, wish I knew more constellations.

48:41.873 --> 48:44.623
(lighter clicks)

48:45.499 --> 48:47.832
You're an aliens guy, right?

48:49.209 --> 48:51.930
I feel like I remember that.

48:51.930 --> 48:56.074
We're not alone in the
universe, according to Ivan.

48:56.074 --> 48:56.907
- No.

48:57.922 --> 49:01.140
No, I'd say we're the only planet

49:01.140 --> 49:02.708
in the whole universe comprised

49:02.708 --> 49:06.083
of over a billion galaxies
that has life on it,

49:06.083 --> 49:09.316
I mean, that's obvious, right?

49:09.316 --> 49:11.624
Forget the fact that we've discovered

49:11.624 --> 49:14.097
over 2,000 exoplanets,

49:14.097 --> 49:17.180
30 of which are in the habitable zone

49:19.106 --> 49:20.631
that we know of, so.

49:20.631 --> 49:22.175
- Sorry I asked.

49:22.175 --> 49:26.342
- I mean, it's ridiculous
to think that we're alone.

49:28.529 --> 49:30.309
- I don't know, I agree with that,

49:30.309 --> 49:34.476
I guess, but I just, I don't
know, what about the farmers,

49:36.580 --> 49:38.667
talking about their
cows getting probed, or.

49:38.667 --> 49:40.462
- [Ivan] Jesus.

49:40.462 --> 49:42.712
- Spacecraft crashing, and.

49:44.494 --> 49:47.529
Do you think we've got
ET locked up somewhere?

49:47.529 --> 49:50.279
- Maybe, maybe life as we know it

49:51.968 --> 49:54.865
travels through the universe on a comet,

49:54.865 --> 49:57.115
or meteor, or spacecraft.

49:59.362 --> 50:00.445
- [John] Huh.

50:01.425 --> 50:04.342
- Maybe life has always been around

50:05.487 --> 50:07.404
in one form or another.

50:08.728 --> 50:11.061
- The important question is,

50:13.088 --> 50:16.296
has anybody ever fucked an alien?

50:16.296 --> 50:18.963
(fire crackles)

50:20.244 --> 50:22.231
- God, I hope so.

50:22.231 --> 50:25.228
(both laugh)

50:25.228 --> 50:26.061
- Me too.

50:27.174 --> 50:31.341
I bet they've got way more holes (laughs).

50:32.816 --> 50:34.256
- Like a flute.

50:34.256 --> 50:36.011
(both laugh)

50:36.011 --> 50:39.271
Wait, (mumbles), under a flute,

50:39.271 --> 50:43.157
they're all, those are all holes.

50:43.157 --> 50:44.796
- [John] It plays music.

50:44.796 --> 50:45.629
(John sings)

50:45.629 --> 50:47.625
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, that's exactly it.

50:47.625 --> 50:48.970
- [John] We're both thinking it.

50:48.970 --> 50:52.256
- [Ivan] That's exactly
what I was thinking.

50:52.256 --> 50:54.201
- [John] Oh, God.

50:54.201 --> 50:55.898
(Ivan sings)

50:55.898 --> 50:57.366
- No, not, not right there.

50:57.366 --> 50:59.065
(Ivan sings)

50:59.065 --> 50:59.898
Yeah, you hit it.

50:59.898 --> 51:00.867
(John sings)

51:00.867 --> 51:03.950
You hit it (laughs).

51:04.843 --> 51:08.093
- [John] That's the dumbest thing ever.

51:12.276 --> 51:15.609
(slow electronic music)

51:16.867 --> 51:19.927

- Oh, man, if I never
seen another billboard

52:01.427 --> 52:04.815
or hear another commercial
again, I'm all set.

52:04.815 --> 52:06.360
- Amen.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.860
(waves crash)

52:10.929 --> 52:12.945
- So what next?

52:12.945 --> 52:16.862
(avant-garde orchestral music)

52:17.982 --> 52:19.469
- You see that big one?

52:19.469 --> 52:20.967
Right by the dead tree?

52:20.967 --> 52:22.384
- Yeah, I see it.

52:25.208 --> 52:26.041
- Now.

52:26.918 --> 52:29.418
(waves crash)

52:42.063 --> 52:45.270
You know, when I first
came up with this idea,

52:45.270 --> 52:48.597
I thought about coming by myself,

52:48.597 --> 52:50.029
and then Em mentioned your name,

52:50.029 --> 52:54.196
and I was like, fuck,
yeah, Ivan, of course!

52:54.302 --> 52:58.181
It's a tragedy that you and
I haven't seen each other

52:58.181 --> 53:00.514
in as long as it's been, so.

53:02.406 --> 53:04.860
It's good to have you here.

53:04.860 --> 53:05.742
- Thanks.

53:05.742 --> 53:06.575
- And

53:07.557 --> 53:10.474
being around people that you trust.

53:13.773 --> 53:15.409
That's all there is.

53:15.409 --> 53:17.326
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

53:18.275 --> 53:21.025
(crickets chirp)

53:23.782 --> 53:26.365
Why didn't you bring her along?

53:30.138 --> 53:32.121
- Em and I are fine.

53:32.121 --> 53:34.994
(slow electronic music)

53:34.994 --> 53:35.827
But

53:39.301 --> 53:43.468
sometimes I think about
all the years ahead of us,

53:45.205 --> 53:47.705
just sitting in the same room,

53:49.743 --> 53:51.804
watching each other lose our minds,

53:51.804 --> 53:54.221
you know, the great collapse.

53:57.263 --> 54:00.175
I think about cleaning up
after our would be kids,

54:00.175 --> 54:04.175
and all the shit that
goes along with that, and.

54:08.498 --> 54:12.331
It just feels like it
could be so suffocating.

54:13.584 --> 54:17.493
So I want to extend the chapter preceding.

54:17.493 --> 54:20.826
(slow electronic music)

54:24.036 --> 54:26.369
- I doubt it'll be that bad.

54:27.438 --> 54:30.208
(slow electronic music)

54:30.208 --> 54:32.982
- Yeah, you're probably right.

54:32.982 --> 54:35.732
(crickets chirp)

54:39.280 --> 54:40.780
Hope you're right.

54:48.788 --> 54:51.641
(birds chirp)

54:51.641 --> 54:55.391
(dissonant orchestral music)

54:58.130 --> 55:00.630
(birds chirp)

55:01.828 --> 55:05.578
(dissonant orchestral music)

55:15.839 --> 55:18.968
(Ivan screams)

55:18.968 --> 55:21.570
(dissonant orchestral music)

55:21.570 --> 55:24.329
(Ivan screams)

55:24.329 --> 55:28.249
(dissonant orchestral music)

55:28.249 --> 55:29.082
Ivan, hey.

55:30.545 --> 55:31.889
Ivan.

55:31.889 --> 55:33.038
Fuck.

55:33.038 --> 55:33.871
You okay?

55:33.871 --> 55:35.230
I'm coming in.

55:35.230 --> 55:37.765
(dissonant orchestral music)

55:37.765 --> 55:39.039
- [Ivan] It's not my fault.

55:39.039 --> 55:41.039
- What's not your fault?

55:41.880 --> 55:43.881
What's not your fault?

55:43.881 --> 55:47.118
Hey, hey, hey, shh, shh, shh, shh.

55:47.118 --> 55:48.449
Hey, it's okay.

55:48.449 --> 55:49.453
(Ivan coughs)

55:49.453 --> 55:52.325
- Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

55:52.325 --> 55:53.158
- We're all good.

55:53.158 --> 55:54.961
- I'm sorry.

55:54.961 --> 55:55.826
I'm sorry.

55:55.826 --> 55:56.659
- Fuck.

55:57.714 --> 56:01.464
(dissonant orchestral music)

56:05.292 --> 56:07.792
(waves crash)

56:17.876 --> 56:19.363
It's all you.

56:19.363 --> 56:21.863
(waves crash)

56:23.102 --> 56:23.935
- Thanks.

56:26.940 --> 56:29.935
- Before we head in,
you sure you don't want

56:29.935 --> 56:32.693
to get a return ticket, get out of here?

56:32.693 --> 56:35.004
I've got no problem doing that for you.

56:35.004 --> 56:36.337
- No, it's fine.

56:38.422 --> 56:42.291
I just feel terrible,
I should have told you.

56:42.291 --> 56:43.561
- It's cool, man, I just need

56:43.561 --> 56:46.548
to know you're going to be okay.

56:46.548 --> 56:48.965
- It's not usually like that.

56:51.043 --> 56:52.626
That was different.

56:54.866 --> 56:58.924
It must be the booze, or
me being off my routine,

56:58.924 --> 57:02.090
or something, it's fucking with me.

57:02.090 --> 57:03.173
- What is it?

57:05.083 --> 57:08.333
- Schizoaffective disorder, they think.

57:10.431 --> 57:14.101
I get paranoid and sometimes hallucinate.

57:14.101 --> 57:16.601
(waves crash)

57:19.895 --> 57:22.893
Yeah, that's how I looked
when they first diagnosed me.

57:22.893 --> 57:25.976
- What do they do, how do you fix it?

57:27.948 --> 57:30.830
- I'm supposed to be on meds.

57:30.830 --> 57:34.076
But the last time I took
those longer than a week,

57:34.076 --> 57:38.111
I couldn't stop dreaming
up ways to kill myself.

57:38.111 --> 57:40.528
- And if you don't take them?

57:41.567 --> 57:44.771
- Then down the rabbit hole I go.

57:44.771 --> 57:48.104
(slow orchestral music)

57:52.260 --> 57:56.015
Alright, I think I'm gonna
go do my meditation thing,

57:56.015 --> 57:58.255
it helps calm the nerves.

57:58.255 --> 58:00.678
- Hey, I don't want to mess
with your mojo or whatever,

58:00.678 --> 58:04.542
but do you mind teaching me how you do it?

58:04.542 --> 58:07.042
(waves crash)

58:12.007 --> 58:14.502
- The goal is to remain
present without a bombardment

58:14.502 --> 58:17.335
of thoughts, just clear your mind.

58:18.826 --> 58:22.993
- No thoughts, that should
be easy for an idiot like me.

58:23.126 --> 58:25.981
- It's a lot harder than it seems,

58:25.981 --> 58:29.690
you're thinking without even realizing it.

58:29.690 --> 58:31.357
Just close your eyes

58:33.008 --> 58:34.175
and breathe in

58:36.130 --> 58:39.463
and feel your weight sink into the sand.

58:41.393 --> 58:44.593
You hear the waves in the distance?

58:44.593 --> 58:45.426
- Yeah.

58:46.282 --> 58:49.194
- Just focus on that,
just focus on that sound

58:49.194 --> 58:50.861
and that sound only.

58:52.300 --> 58:53.744
If a thought enters your mind,

58:53.744 --> 58:57.661
just let it float out to
sea with the next wave

58:59.300 --> 59:00.633
and the next one

59:03.388 --> 59:04.721
and the next one

59:06.607 --> 59:08.231
and so on.

59:08.231 --> 59:10.731
(waves crash)

59:22.148 --> 59:24.328
- My leg's asleep.

59:24.328 --> 59:26.828
(waves crash)

59:29.614 --> 59:31.197
This is impossible.

59:33.546 --> 59:36.214
It's impossible not to think.

59:36.214 --> 59:38.714
(waves crash)

59:39.981 --> 59:40.814
Hey.

59:42.432 --> 59:43.265
Hey!

59:46.531 --> 59:48.594
I'm gonna head down the
beach, take a look around.

59:48.594 --> 59:52.430
Feel free to join me when
you're done pretending.

59:52.430 --> 59:54.930
(waves crash)

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:09.314
(insects buzz)

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:14.508
(stick snaps)

01:00:16.627 --> 01:00:19.210
(insects buzz)

01:00:23.082 --> 01:00:27.249
Jesus, fuck, you scared
the shit out of me, dude.

01:00:27.913 --> 01:00:30.739
You've been gone for like, 10 hours.

01:00:30.739 --> 01:00:33.972
The sun's going down, so we'll
have to go to town tomorrow.

01:00:33.972 --> 01:00:37.444
- Sorry, when I'm in, I'm in deep.

01:00:37.444 --> 01:00:38.508
- Gross.

01:00:38.508 --> 01:00:39.841
(both laugh)

01:00:39.841 --> 01:00:42.275
Hey, help me find some
more shit to burn, huh?

01:00:42.275 --> 01:00:43.649
- Sure.

01:00:43.649 --> 01:00:46.232
(insects buzz)

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.812
- So I've been thinking.

01:00:53.137 --> 01:00:54.554
And is that whole

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.853
scientist wizard

01:00:59.892 --> 01:01:02.309
out of body study thing real?

01:01:05.217 --> 01:01:06.050
- What?

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:08.023
Yeah, it's--

01:01:08.023 --> 01:01:08.856
- [John] They work with a lot

01:01:08.856 --> 01:01:11.356
of Schizoaffective people, or?

01:01:13.578 --> 01:01:15.518
- Yeah, I mean, it's just--

01:01:15.518 --> 01:01:17.185
- Do they even know?

01:01:19.313 --> 01:01:23.480
- Look, I get it, and you're
right to be skeptical,

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:27.583
it's.

01:01:28.992 --> 01:01:32.559
- I'm not judging at
all, I'm just curious.

01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:35.226
(fire crackles)

01:01:39.757 --> 01:01:41.616
- It's mostly true.

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:44.283
(fire crackles)

01:01:47.022 --> 01:01:48.715
- Which parts?

01:01:48.715 --> 01:01:51.798
(slow ambient music)

01:01:55.123 --> 01:01:56.506
- The scientist guy's a real guy,

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:59.173
but I don't know him personally.

01:02:01.621 --> 01:02:04.862
I follow his writings, but
I'm not part of the study,

01:02:04.862 --> 01:02:06.921
there is no study.

01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:09.640
(fire crackles)

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.140
I just thought his
teachings would be something

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.433
to help my situation.

01:02:14.433 --> 01:02:18.172
(slow ambient music)

01:02:18.172 --> 01:02:20.537
- Are you in school, is that even true?

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:22.680
- Yeah, part time.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.347
(fire crackles)

01:02:27.358 --> 01:02:29.358
Look, what would you do?

01:02:32.566 --> 01:02:35.483
I'm losing time, and I'm losing it.

01:02:37.198 --> 01:02:40.070
- I just don't want to
see a friend get hurt

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:44.237
studying the writings of
some bullshit, new age guru.

01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:46.971
- Too late.

01:02:46.971 --> 01:02:49.638
(fire crackles)

01:02:54.519 --> 01:02:57.080
And I don't think meditation
is the leading cause

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.580
of death anywhere.

01:02:59.668 --> 01:03:01.448
- It's not the meditation
I'm worried about,

01:03:01.448 --> 01:03:05.031
it's what you're not doing medically.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:08.476
(fire crackles)

01:03:08.476 --> 01:03:10.926
What is it you're trying
to achieve, anyway?

01:03:10.926 --> 01:03:13.093
- Just a little more time.

01:03:15.069 --> 01:03:18.510
Just more time, as a clear-headed person

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.476
that's not a burden on anyone.

01:03:21.476 --> 01:03:24.143
(fire crackles)

01:03:25.049 --> 01:03:28.132
(slow ambient music)

01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:36.184
(birds chirp)

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:51.866
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:03:52.935 --> 01:03:55.435
(birds chirp)

01:03:58.163 --> 01:04:01.913
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:04:05.146 --> 01:04:07.646
(birds chirp)

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:13.596
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:04:29.081 --> 01:04:31.581
(birds chirp)

01:04:44.064 --> 01:04:46.564
(pen scrawls)

01:04:49.897 --> 01:04:52.397
(paper tears)

01:04:58.339 --> 01:05:00.839
(birds chirp)

01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:09.018
(wind blows)

01:05:14.553 --> 01:05:17.220
(paper rustles)

01:05:22.531 --> 01:05:23.980
(zipper zips)

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.897
(avant-garde orchestral music)

01:05:55.352 --> 01:05:58.204
(John hollers)

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:02.121
(avant-garde orchestral music)

01:06:08.295 --> 01:06:10.795
(birds chirp)

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:17.210
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:06:18.482 --> 01:06:21.399
(foliage crumples)

01:06:24.278 --> 01:06:28.028
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:07:11.644 --> 01:07:12.477
Hi.

01:07:15.815 --> 01:07:18.232
(John chews)

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:24.586
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:07:25.604 --> 01:07:27.914
(plastic crinkles)

01:07:27.914 --> 01:07:30.664
(phone vibrates)

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.617
(plastic crinkles)

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:43.480
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:07:53.832 --> 01:07:55.165
- What the fuck?

01:07:58.178 --> 01:08:01.117
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:08:01.117 --> 01:08:01.950
Fuck.

01:08:04.442 --> 01:08:07.752
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:08:07.752 --> 01:08:08.585
Fuck.

01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:14.952
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:09:25.481 --> 01:09:28.398
(foliage crumples)

01:09:31.307 --> 01:09:35.057
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:09:55.519 --> 01:09:58.019
(waves crash)

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:04.280
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:10:05.933 --> 01:10:08.683
(zipper squeaks)

01:10:10.778 --> 01:10:14.528
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:23.363
- You alright?

01:10:23.363 --> 01:10:24.485
- Yep.

01:10:24.485 --> 01:10:25.900
Where'd you go off to?

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:29.162
- Oh, I'd, uh, I thought
I'd go try meditating

01:10:29.162 --> 01:10:31.745
on top of that hill over there.

01:10:32.648 --> 01:10:35.098
- See anything interesting?

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:36.598
- Only in my mind.

01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:41.793
What's up?

01:10:41.793 --> 01:10:42.784
- I'm gonna head into town

01:10:42.784 --> 01:10:45.784
and pick up some beverages and shit.

01:10:46.644 --> 01:10:47.535
- [Ivan] Okay.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.202
- [John] You coming?

01:10:50.126 --> 01:10:51.293
- [Ivan] Sure.

01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:56.172
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:11:11.619 --> 01:11:12.452
- What?

01:11:15.129 --> 01:11:19.296
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:11:19.662 --> 01:11:21.569
What are you talking about?

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:22.402
How?

01:11:23.736 --> 01:11:26.319
(John mumbles)

01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:32.287
(avant-garde orchestral music)

01:11:48.902 --> 01:11:51.699
(fire crackles)

01:11:51.699 --> 01:11:54.199
(waves crash)

01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:56.231
Poker?

01:11:57.816 --> 01:11:59.381
(waves crash)

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:01.580
- No, I suck at it.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:04.087
(waves crash)

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.670
- Who gives a shit?

01:12:10.907 --> 01:12:12.349
- I'm good.

01:12:12.349 --> 01:12:13.766
- Come on, bitch.

01:12:16.312 --> 01:12:19.474
(waves crash)

01:12:19.474 --> 01:12:22.696
(John laughs)

01:12:22.696 --> 01:12:24.279
Yeah, there you go.

01:12:26.601 --> 01:12:28.744
- You should eat something.

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:32.911
- Not hungry, I haven't
been hungry all fucking day.

01:12:36.225 --> 01:12:38.532
So why can't you drink?

01:12:38.532 --> 01:12:41.365
What's it do to your busted brain?

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:43.675
- I get confused.

01:12:47.259 --> 01:12:49.082
(John spits)

01:12:49.082 --> 01:12:52.082
- That little sip make you confused?

01:12:53.745 --> 01:12:55.412
- Not right now, no.

01:12:57.441 --> 01:12:59.858
- Come on, man, get confused.

01:13:01.124 --> 01:13:02.957
Don't be such a pussy.

01:13:04.035 --> 01:13:06.290
- So what are the stakes?

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:08.790
(John laughs)

01:13:10.169 --> 01:13:12.995
- [John] Oh, fucking, perfect.

01:13:12.995 --> 01:13:14.608
- What?

01:13:14.608 --> 01:13:17.108
(waves crash)

01:13:18.849 --> 01:13:20.849
- You're a fucking liar.

01:13:23.309 --> 01:13:26.567
(waves crash)

01:13:26.567 --> 01:13:27.817
I gotta go pee.

01:13:31.891 --> 01:13:35.641
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:41.623

(footsteps crunch)

01:14:51.675 --> 01:14:53.278
- [Ivan] Whoa.

01:14:53.278 --> 01:14:57.026
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:58.934
Get up, get up,

01:14:58.934 --> 01:15:00.903
you piece of shit.

01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:05.070
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:15:05.473 --> 01:15:07.306
Woo, it's a good idea,

01:15:08.483 --> 01:15:09.316
ah.

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:13.107
Fuck.

01:15:14.256 --> 01:15:16.756
(waves crash)

01:15:25.765 --> 01:15:28.182
(John pants)

(nylon rustles)

01:19:56.553 --> 01:20:00.720
My friend is missing, we've
been camping on the beach,

01:20:02.072 --> 01:20:02.905
and, uh,

01:20:04.248 --> 01:20:06.231
I woke up this morning,

01:20:06.231 --> 01:20:10.398
he was just gone, I'm afraid
he might have drowned.

01:20:13.305 --> 01:20:14.138
Yeah.

01:20:15.616 --> 01:20:16.866
Yes, thank you.

01:20:19.366 --> 01:20:20.199
Thank you.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:25.967

(clock ticks)

01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:44.862
- So when was the last
time you saw your friend?

01:20:44.862 --> 01:20:49.029
- Last night, he was there
when I went to sleep.

01:20:49.173 --> 01:20:51.246
- [David] Did he make or
receive any phone calls

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:53.587
or text messages before he disappeared

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:55.337
that you're aware of?

01:20:56.471 --> 01:20:58.388
- I don't think so, no.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.787
- Can I ask what happened?

01:21:02.739 --> 01:21:06.906
- Yeah, night before last
I slipped down this cliff,

01:21:07.644 --> 01:21:11.811
and Ivan stopped my fall by
stomping on this hand hard.

01:21:14.628 --> 01:21:16.713
Lucky to be alive, really.

01:21:16.713 --> 01:21:19.318
- I would say so, you fellas
sure got the rough end

01:21:19.318 --> 01:21:21.651
of it out there, didn't you?

01:21:22.637 --> 01:21:23.631
Was there any indication

01:21:23.631 --> 01:21:26.176
that he would want to leave the camp?

01:21:26.176 --> 01:21:28.671
Did you have any arguments with Ivan,

01:21:28.671 --> 01:21:30.852
any disagreements that caused him

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:33.185
to run off or head for home?

01:21:34.943 --> 01:21:38.430
- I mean, we had a little disagreement,

01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:40.793
I thought he was drinking
a little too much,

01:21:40.793 --> 01:21:44.683
but he eventually cooled
off and we made our peace,

01:21:44.683 --> 01:21:47.942
he thanked me, I thought it was okay,

01:21:47.942 --> 01:21:50.223
can't imagine that would
make him want to run off.

01:21:50.223 --> 01:21:53.680
- How about you, did you
have a lot to drink as well?

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.159
- A little later in the evening.

01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:57.489
- On the beach?

01:21:57.489 --> 01:21:59.684
- Yeah, on the beach.

01:21:59.684 --> 01:22:01.492
- You know it's illegal to
have alcoholic beverages

01:22:01.492 --> 01:22:03.325
on protected property?

01:22:07.148 --> 01:22:08.811
Okay.

01:22:08.811 --> 01:22:11.365
So, bigger fish to fry,

01:22:11.365 --> 01:22:15.167
what else can you tell
me about Ivan Marshall?

01:22:15.167 --> 01:22:17.588
- A couple days ago I found out he has

01:22:17.588 --> 01:22:19.671
Schizoaffective disorder.

01:22:22.898 --> 01:22:25.261
I don't think that would,

01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:29.428
has anything to do with him
disappearing, but, you know.

01:22:29.813 --> 01:22:31.773
- And you found this out after you decided

01:22:31.773 --> 01:22:35.764
to travel 2,000 miles
away from home with him?

01:22:35.764 --> 01:22:37.138
- We were college roommates,

01:22:37.138 --> 01:22:40.138
we knew each other better back then.

01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:45.625
He had what I would
describe as like, a flare up

01:22:46.007 --> 01:22:48.837
or an outburst or something,
I woke up one morning

01:22:48.837 --> 01:22:51.920
and he was having a paranoid episode.

01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:57.515
He sort of snapped out of it

01:22:57.515 --> 01:23:00.261
and that's when I got the story.

01:23:00.261 --> 01:23:04.428
- Look, John, this doesn't
sound good, to be blunt.

01:23:05.469 --> 01:23:06.824
There's a lot of rough terrain out there,

01:23:06.824 --> 01:23:08.437
and a lot of things can happen,

01:23:08.437 --> 01:23:11.416
and they do happen, as you know.

01:23:11.416 --> 01:23:14.677
Now, would it be too much
trouble for you to stick

01:23:14.677 --> 01:23:18.844
around town for a few days
while we conduct a search?

01:23:18.935 --> 01:23:20.018
- Not at all.

01:23:21.004 --> 01:23:22.740
- Do you have any contact information

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.909
for his next of kin, or who that would be?

01:23:25.909 --> 01:23:29.726
- He lived with his mom,
I don't have her info,

01:23:29.726 --> 01:23:32.059
but her name's Anna Marshall.

01:23:33.004 --> 01:23:33.837
- Okay.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.446
I'll make some calls and I'll get in touch

01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:40.946
with her and let her know what's going on.

01:23:59.719 --> 01:24:02.469
(water splashes)

01:24:10.626 --> 01:24:13.376
(mirror squeaks)

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.077
(slow ambient music)

01:24:37.077 --> 01:24:39.494
(John sighs)

01:24:41.739 --> 01:24:44.822
(slow ambient music)

01:24:45.785 --> 01:24:48.202
(John sighs)

01:24:50.096 --> 01:24:53.179
(slow ambient music)

01:25:08.745 --> 01:25:11.162
(John sighs)

01:25:20.571 --> 01:25:21.404
- Yes.

01:25:24.746 --> 01:25:27.910
(slow ambient music)

01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:30.410
(phone rings)

01:25:33.119 --> 01:25:34.493
- [Emily] John?

01:25:34.493 --> 01:25:35.326
- Hi.

01:25:40.906 --> 01:25:43.656
(phone vibrates)

01:25:52.554 --> 01:25:54.346
This is John.

01:25:54.346 --> 01:25:57.568
- [David] Yeah, John, this
is detective Martinez.

01:25:57.568 --> 01:26:00.747
- [John] Yes, yeah, good to hear from you.

01:26:00.747 --> 01:26:01.580
- [David] Do you mind heading down

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.997
to the station in 30 minutes?

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:09.352
- [John] Yeah, absolutely,
everything okay?

01:26:09.352 --> 01:26:12.128
- [David] I'd rather chat
in person if you don't mind,

01:26:12.128 --> 01:26:15.865
just head to the station,
we'll get it all sorted out.

01:26:15.865 --> 01:26:16.698
- [John] Okay.

01:26:16.698 --> 01:26:18.143
- [David] See you soon.

01:26:18.143 --> 01:26:20.173
- [John] Thank you.

01:26:20.173 --> 01:26:23.923
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.966
- Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say

01:26:28.966 --> 01:26:32.773
that we haven't found any trace of Ivan.

01:26:32.773 --> 01:26:35.574
We did find a corpse up in the hills

01:26:35.574 --> 01:26:38.062
about a quarter mile from your campsite,

01:26:38.062 --> 01:26:39.800
but the level of decomposition suggests

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.487
that it couldn't possibly be our guy,

01:26:42.487 --> 01:26:45.553
he was up there for at
least a year, maybe more.

01:26:45.553 --> 01:26:47.905
Apparent suicide, you
just never know sometimes

01:26:47.905 --> 01:26:49.612
what you'll find up there.

01:26:49.612 --> 01:26:51.379
- That's insane.

01:26:51.379 --> 01:26:52.491
- And other than some litter that we found

01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:55.414
around the campsite,
there were really no clues

01:26:55.414 --> 01:26:58.314
that were helping us out.

01:26:58.314 --> 01:26:59.614
I'd say the next thing for you to do is

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:03.781
to head back home, I know you
have a life to get back to,

01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:06.417
but we'll continue our search here,

01:27:06.417 --> 01:27:10.505
and I will personally keep you up to date.

01:27:10.505 --> 01:27:13.782
I'm really sorry, John, and at
the risk of sounding cliche,

01:27:13.782 --> 01:27:16.093
I want to let you know that
we really are doing everything

01:27:16.093 --> 01:27:18.426
that we can at our disposal.

01:27:19.285 --> 01:27:21.507
- I appreciate it, thanks.

01:27:21.507 --> 01:27:23.497
- You have my number, please call me

01:27:23.497 --> 01:27:26.174
if you remember anything, I mean it.

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:27.629
- You got it.

01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:30.129
- Have a safe trip, my friend.

01:27:35.793 --> 01:27:39.543
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:27:45.524 --> 01:27:48.107
(door rattles)

01:27:53.014 --> 01:27:54.514
- [John] I'm home.

01:27:55.495 --> 01:27:56.328
- You are.

01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:03.237
- [John] Em, I'm so sorry for
every goddamned, dumb thing--

01:28:03.733 --> 01:28:05.650
- I know, I know, John.

01:28:07.524 --> 01:28:08.357
It's okay,

01:28:10.396 --> 01:28:12.487
you're home now.

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:16.379
(slow ambient music)

01:28:16.379 --> 01:28:17.212
It's okay.

01:28:19.902 --> 01:28:22.985
(slow ambient music)

01:28:34.817 --> 01:28:36.484
- [John] I love you.

01:28:41.408 --> 01:28:42.241
So

01:28:44.112 --> 01:28:44.945
fucking

01:28:45.916 --> 01:28:46.749
much.

01:28:47.585 --> 01:28:50.668
(slow ambient music)

01:28:53.713 --> 01:28:55.213
- I love you, too.

01:29:08.926 --> 01:29:11.593
(traffic roars)

01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:18.374
(police siren wails)

01:29:20.372 --> 01:29:22.789
(John gasps)

01:29:25.567 --> 01:29:28.594
- [Emily] Hey, whoa, John, wake up.

01:29:28.594 --> 01:29:29.427
(John chokes)

01:29:29.427 --> 01:29:30.260
Hey, John.

01:29:31.395 --> 01:29:32.729
You're dreaming.

01:29:32.729 --> 01:29:33.569
(John gasps)

01:29:33.569 --> 01:29:35.224
- [John] What, Em?

01:29:35.224 --> 01:29:36.385
- Yeah.

01:29:36.385 --> 01:29:37.218
- [John] Emily.

01:29:37.218 --> 01:29:38.051
- It's okay.

01:29:38.051 --> 01:29:42.218
- [John] What, I can't,
I don't want to go back.

01:29:42.591 --> 01:29:45.895
- No, it's okay, you're just dreaming.

01:29:45.895 --> 01:29:48.395
(John groans)

01:29:54.881 --> 01:29:55.714
John?

01:29:58.396 --> 01:29:59.229
John?

01:30:03.367 --> 01:30:04.200
Jesus.

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:13.571
(wind chimes tinkle)

01:30:17.465 --> 01:30:19.965
- Ivan is his own man, I mean,

01:30:20.896 --> 01:30:24.506
sometimes he would disappear for weeks,

01:30:24.506 --> 01:30:26.130
weeks, and I wouldn't know where he was.

01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:28.130
I didn't know if he was dead,

01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:30.713
or off in some alley somewhere.

01:30:32.471 --> 01:30:34.532
He just wanted to live,

01:30:34.532 --> 01:30:36.938
and I always tried to protect him,

01:30:36.938 --> 01:30:41.105
but I know how important it
was for him to see things

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.527
and experience things,
and he just never wanted

01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:49.997
to slow down until the
disease finally made him stop.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.112
(wind chimes tinkle)

01:30:55.112 --> 01:30:57.445
(Anna sobs)

01:31:03.983 --> 01:31:06.650
(train rattles)

01:31:08.384 --> 01:31:11.366
(slow ambient music)

01:31:11.366 --> 01:31:14.287
(dogs bark)

01:31:14.287 --> 01:31:16.787
(bells chime)

01:31:20.678 --> 01:31:24.176
(train rattles)

01:31:24.176 --> 01:31:26.367
(slow ambient music)

01:31:26.367 --> 01:31:28.784
(John sighs)

01:31:31.258 --> 01:31:34.341
(slow ambient music)

01:31:36.619 --> 01:31:39.119
(door creaks)

01:31:42.475 --> 01:31:45.558
(slow ambient music)

01:31:46.765 --> 01:31:48.682
- Hey, giving it a try?

01:31:50.747 --> 01:31:54.399
- [John] Yeah, um, can
we talk for a second?

01:31:54.399 --> 01:31:55.941
Can we sit?

01:31:55.941 --> 01:31:56.774
- Sure.

01:31:57.856 --> 01:31:58.689
What's up?

01:32:00.489 --> 01:32:01.322
- Um.

01:32:03.289 --> 01:32:07.456
This is, it's going to be
really hard for me to say.

01:32:12.008 --> 01:32:14.935
I can't keep it in anymore.

01:32:14.935 --> 01:32:18.984
No matter what I say, or
however long it takes,

01:32:18.984 --> 01:32:21.280
just let me get it all out.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.113
- Okay.

01:32:24.991 --> 01:32:25.824
- Okay.

01:32:27.299 --> 01:32:30.380
I know you slept with Ivan.

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.955
I know you did it more than once,

01:32:32.955 --> 01:32:37.122
and I know that you wanted
to leave me for him.

01:32:37.702 --> 01:32:40.785
(slow ambient music)

01:32:43.359 --> 01:32:44.526
- He told you.

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:47.460
- He didn't have to.

01:32:50.105 --> 01:32:50.938
Look.

01:32:52.576 --> 01:32:54.076
I need you to know

01:32:55.734 --> 01:32:58.401
that I understand why you would,

01:33:00.005 --> 01:33:03.755
why you did it, and I
completely forgive you.

01:33:05.885 --> 01:33:06.718
- God.

01:33:08.674 --> 01:33:12.757
- [John] It's okay, look,
if we're gonna do this,

01:33:13.684 --> 01:33:16.682
we just need to put it all on the table.

01:33:16.682 --> 01:33:17.515
- I can't.

01:33:17.515 --> 01:33:18.682
- [John] What?

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:20.964
- I said I can't do this.

01:33:20.964 --> 01:33:23.881
- [John] Can't do what, which part?

01:33:24.751 --> 01:33:28.084
- All of it, I can't marry you, I won't.

01:33:29.328 --> 01:33:33.495
- [John] I'm saying it
doesn't matter, it's okay.

01:33:33.551 --> 01:33:36.218
- No, it's not okay, I feel like

01:33:39.983 --> 01:33:42.066
I know that you know, and

01:33:43.903 --> 01:33:46.255
every time I look at you,
it'll be this mirror,

01:33:46.255 --> 01:33:49.403
reminding me of what I
did, and then I'll think

01:33:49.403 --> 01:33:51.687
of all the fucked up stuff that you did.

01:33:51.687 --> 01:33:53.464
- [John] You know I'm
sorry for all of that,

01:33:53.464 --> 01:33:56.131
how badly I feel for everything.

01:33:56.992 --> 01:33:58.280
Please.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.030
- It's not just that.

01:34:02.734 --> 01:34:06.901
I haven't been happy for a long time now,

01:34:06.904 --> 01:34:09.271
I don't, I don't want to be in a place

01:34:09.271 --> 01:34:11.381
where we keep having to apologize

01:34:11.381 --> 01:34:15.548
and forgive each other
over and over again.

01:34:15.604 --> 01:34:16.437
- But

01:34:18.568 --> 01:34:19.901
that's marriage.

01:34:22.767 --> 01:34:24.517
- Not, not to me, no.

01:34:25.725 --> 01:34:26.725
- Goddammit.

01:34:28.424 --> 01:34:29.924
Oh, what the fuck?

01:34:31.661 --> 01:34:34.349
What did you do, why the
hell did you do, please?

01:34:34.349 --> 01:34:35.182
Please.

01:34:39.168 --> 01:34:41.271
- I should have ended this a lot sooner.

01:34:41.271 --> 01:34:42.104
- [John] No.

01:34:42.104 --> 01:34:45.895
- I was an idiot for dragging it out.

01:34:45.895 --> 01:34:46.728
- [John] No.

01:34:46.728 --> 01:34:48.430
- It's over.

01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:49.268
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:34:49.268 --> 01:34:51.404
I just need to be by myself.

01:34:51.404 --> 01:34:52.237
- Mm-mm.

01:34:53.594 --> 01:34:55.608
Please don't do this, please don't,

01:34:55.608 --> 01:34:59.608
please don't do this,
look, you're not an idiot.

01:35:00.609 --> 01:35:01.859
- You're right.

01:35:02.975 --> 01:35:07.142
I'm weak, and that's why I
couldn't end this sooner.

01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:11.788
(tinnitus ringing)

01:35:14.845 --> 01:35:16.137
- [John] Oh, fucking fuck.

01:35:16.137 --> 01:35:16.970
- Hey.

01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:18.720
- No, fuck you, fuck.

01:35:20.568 --> 01:35:21.641
Em.

01:35:21.641 --> 01:35:24.397
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:35:24.397 --> 01:35:25.784
- No.

01:35:25.784 --> 01:35:26.929
- Em.

01:35:26.929 --> 01:35:30.679
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:35:33.475 --> 01:35:34.975
I'm sorry, please.

01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:39.090
(door handle shakes)

01:35:39.090 --> 01:35:42.840
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:35:47.812 --> 01:35:48.740
(door bangs)

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:49.573
- John.

01:35:52.029 --> 01:35:55.430
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:59.180
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:36:03.846 --> 01:36:06.596
- [Emily] Take whatever you need,

01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:09.756
whatever is yours.

01:36:09.756 --> 01:36:13.506
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:36:40.039 --> 01:36:42.452
(door creaks)

01:36:42.452 --> 01:36:45.146
(Emily cries)

01:36:45.146 --> 01:36:46.927
(door slams)

01:36:46.927 --> 01:36:49.427
(Emily cries)

01:37:00.719 --> 01:37:03.636
(footsteps crunch)

01:37:07.168 --> 01:37:09.585
(horn honks)

01:37:19.697 --> 01:37:22.197
(birds chirp)

01:37:30.014 --> 01:37:32.597
(Ivan screams)

01:37:37.607 --> 01:37:40.024
(John gasps)

01:37:43.935 --> 01:37:46.602
(traffic roars)

01:38:10.158 --> 01:38:14.325
- You are a creator that uses
and manipulates the evolution

01:38:14.582 --> 01:38:18.490
of consciousness, and you are the result

01:38:18.490 --> 01:38:21.458
of that same process,
at both the non-physical

01:38:21.458 --> 01:38:23.458
and the physical levels.

01:38:24.579 --> 01:38:28.402
What is it they say, with
great power comes great sex?

01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:29.787
(audience laughs)

01:38:29.787 --> 01:38:30.851
Money?

01:38:30.851 --> 01:38:32.473
(audience laughs)

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:33.306
Whatever.

01:38:34.883 --> 01:38:36.704
So what does all of this mean?

01:38:36.704 --> 01:38:39.200
It means that you are the one in control,

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.303
you ultimately choose the
path that's right for you,

01:38:42.303 --> 01:38:44.886
and all of this will take time,

01:38:45.965 --> 01:38:48.328
but your skillset will improve,

01:38:48.328 --> 01:38:51.645
if that's the path you choose.

01:38:51.645 --> 01:38:55.395
(dissonant orchestral music)

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:37.467
(moves into slow orchestral music)

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:29.139
(moves into slow electronic music)
