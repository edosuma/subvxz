WEBVTT

00:04.167 --> 00:06.600
- HEY, HILLBILLIES.
- HEY.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.667
HEY, LISTEN, SOME GUY CALLED
FOR YOU THREE TIMES TODAY.

00:09.667 --> 00:10.833
SCOTT SOMEBODY?

00:10.833 --> 00:12.767
- OH, OH, SCOTT FRIEDMAN, YEAH.

00:12.767 --> 00:16.367
YOU KNOW, YOU MET HIM
AND WALTER AT MY REUNION.

00:16.367 --> 00:17.700
YOU KNOW, SCOTT AND WALTER.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.633
THEY WERE, LIKE,
MY BEST FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:19.633 --> 00:22.467
- OH, YEAH, THE DORKS.

00:22.467 --> 00:24.633
- OKAY, BECAUSE
YOU WERE A CHEERLEADER,

00:24.633 --> 00:26.600
MY FRIENDS ARE DORKS.
- NO.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.200
THEY'RE DORKS BECAUSE,
AT THE REUNION,

00:28.200 --> 00:32.200
THEY TALKED TO EACH OTHER
ON WALKIE-TALKIES.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.133
- THAT THEY BUILT THEMSELVES.

00:34.133 --> 00:35.600
HUH, THEY'RE VERY SMART,

00:35.600 --> 00:37.333
AND THEY'RE STARTING
A BUSINESS TOGETHER.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.567
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH, A GO-KART TRACK.

00:39.567 --> 00:43.100
- OH, THAT'S A FUN PLACE
TO USE YOUR WALKIE-TALKIES.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.500
- ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN PRESENTED
WITH A VERY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.233
- WHAT?
- WELL, YOU SEE...

00:48.233 --> 00:49.667
TO GET THEIR BUSINESS
OFF THE GROUND,

00:49.667 --> 00:51.600
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A FEW SELECT INVESTORS.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.500
- OH, GO-KARTS?
RAY, I DON'T THINK--

00:53.500 --> 00:55.500
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.500
- [sighs]
CAN I FEED THE CHILD?

00:59.500 --> 01:01.233
- BUT COME ON,
THOUGH, I MEAN IT.

01:01.233 --> 01:03.633
LOOK, PEOPLE LOVE GO-KARTS.
WHO LIKES GO-KARTS?

01:03.633 --> 01:05.567
- YAY! YAY! GO-KARTS!
- YEAH, SEE?

01:05.567 --> 01:07.133
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL THEM

01:07.133 --> 01:08.600
WE'RE MOVING INTO
A GINGERBREAD HOUSE?

01:08.600 --> 01:11.233
[children cheering]

01:11.233 --> 01:13.300
- COME ON,
I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.800
THESE GUYS KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE DOING, REALLY.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.200
WALTER'S DAD
OWNED AN AMUSEMENT PARK,

01:17.200 --> 01:18.500
AND SCOTT'S AN ENGINEER.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.067
AND NOT A WOO-WOO ENGINEER,

01:20.067 --> 01:22.733
ONE WHO ACTUALLY
DESIGNS STUFF.

01:22.733 --> 01:24.467
- WELL, DO THEY HAVE,
LIKE, A PLAN

01:24.467 --> 01:26.733
OR SOMETHING ON PAPER
THAT WE CAN SEE?

01:26.733 --> 01:28.233
- YEAH, SURE,
I'M SURE THAT THEY DO.

01:28.233 --> 01:29.700
- I MEAN, NOT JUST,
LIKE, A DRAWING

01:29.700 --> 01:30.867
OF A GO-KART ON A NAPKIN--

01:30.867 --> 01:34.433
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,
TANGIBLE WITH NUMBERS.

01:34.433 --> 01:38.633
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T WORRY.
THEY GOT NUMBERS.

01:38.633 --> 01:42.167
JEEZ, GOTTA SPELL EVERYTHING
OUT FOR THE CHEERLEADER.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.100
- THE MAJORITY OF YOUR
INVESTMENT IN KART ATTACK

01:52.100 --> 01:54.833
WILL GO TOWARDS INITIAL
CONSTRUCTION COSTS,

01:54.833 --> 01:56.633
A PERCENTAGE OF WHICH
WILL BE PAID BACK

01:56.633 --> 01:58.567
THROUGH EARNINGS,
WHICH ARE OUTLINED

01:58.567 --> 02:00.300
IN THE BOOKLET
I HANDED OUT EARLIER,

02:00.300 --> 02:03.833
PRIMARILY IN SECTIONS A-2,
D-5, AND E-15,

02:03.833 --> 02:07.700
BUT ALSO IN THE APPENDIX,
SECTIONS 9, 11, AND 12.

02:09.633 --> 02:12.800
LISTEN, I KNOW I'M THROWING
A LOT OF NUMBERS AT YOU

02:12.800 --> 02:14.300
AND THAT CAN GET CONFUSING,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.467
SO LET ME GIVE YOU SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE VISUAL

02:16.467 --> 02:20.133
TO HELP SHOW YOU
WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT.

02:20.133 --> 02:23.367
WALTER, WE'RE READY.

02:28.367 --> 02:29.800
MY PARTNER WALTER
IS WEARING

02:29.800 --> 02:31.400
OUR PROTOTYPE RACING GEAR.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.400
IT'S STANDARD ISSUE
FOR ALL EMPLOYEES.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.100
- COOL.
- IT'S JUST A PROTOTYPE.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.367
THE ACTUAL UNIFORM
WILL BE FLAME RETARDANT,

02:38.367 --> 02:40.367
WHICH IS A GOOD THING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

02:40.367 --> 02:42.633
'CAUSE YOU ARE SMOKING,
MY FRIEND.

02:42.633 --> 02:44.567
[imitates sizzling]

02:44.567 --> 02:45.900
- [laughs]

02:45.900 --> 02:47.800
- SO, UH, TO SUM UP,

02:47.800 --> 02:50.900
KART ATTACK--
MUCH MORE THAN A GO-KART TRACK.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.433
IT'S A FAMILY
SHARING AN ICE CREAM CONE

02:53.433 --> 02:56.367
AT OUR FULLY STOCKED
SNACK BAR.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.833
IT'S A SAFE
AND SECURE PLACE

02:57.833 --> 03:00.333
FOR YOUR KIDS TO PLAY
THE LATEST VIDEO GAMES.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.700
IT'S A BAR MITZVAH

03:01.700 --> 03:04.300
IN ONE OF OUR FAITH FRIENDLY
FUNCTION ROOMS,

03:04.300 --> 03:05.967
BUT MOST OF ALL, IT'S...

03:05.967 --> 03:08.200
- [muffled]
FUN.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.500
- WE HOPE YOU'LL BE
THE NEXT TO EXPERIENCE

03:10.500 --> 03:11.500
A KART ATTACK.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.067
THANK YOU.

03:14.067 --> 03:15.967
- AH, HEY.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.033
THAT WAS AWESOME, GUYS.

03:18.033 --> 03:19.367
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.000
I--YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING
TO USE A FOG MACHINE

03:21.000 --> 03:22.433
FOR WALTER'S ENTRANCE,

03:22.433 --> 03:24.833
BUT I FIGURED IT WAS
AN INTIMATE SETTING AND--

03:24.833 --> 03:27.167
- NO, IT WAS GREAT.
THANKS.

03:27.167 --> 03:28.733
SO COULD WE JUST HAVE
A FEW MINUTES

03:28.733 --> 03:30.000
TO TALK THINGS OVER?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.333
- HEY, YEAH, TALK AWAY,
YOU KNOW?

03:31.333 --> 03:33.967
I'LL JUST BE BREAKING DOWN
THE SET.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.500
- ALL RIGHT.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.767
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WELL, IT WAS VERY GOOD.

03:41.767 --> 03:42.900
- VERY PROFESSIONAL.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.233
- YEAH, I WAS SURPRISED.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.467
I MEAN, THEY'VE CLEARLY DONE
THEIR RESEARCH.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.467
- YES, THEY HAVE.
SO WE IN?

03:49.467 --> 03:53.533
- OH, NO.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.900
- WHY?

03:55.900 --> 03:59.067
- LOOK, HONEY, I SAID THAT
I WOULD HEAR THEIR PROPOSAL,

03:59.067 --> 04:00.400
AND I DID,
BUT NOTHING IN IT CHANGES

04:00.400 --> 04:01.933
THE FACT THAT
IT'S GO-KARTS.

04:01.933 --> 04:03.133
- YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT COME ON,

04:03.133 --> 04:04.567
THAT'S WHAT'S FUN ABOUT IT.

04:04.567 --> 04:07.200
PLUS, IT'S A SOLID INVESTMENT.
- [sighs]

04:07.200 --> 04:08.600
- BESIDES, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE THINKING

04:08.600 --> 04:10.500
OF NAMING A GO-KART
AFTER YOU.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.767
YEAH, THE DEBRA.

04:12.767 --> 04:16.067
IT'S BLACK.

04:16.067 --> 04:19.233
- THAT IS EVERY GIRL'S DREAM.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.567
- COME ON,
I CAN'T TURN THEM DOWN.

04:20.567 --> 04:21.933
THEY DID A SHOW
AND EVERYTHING.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.200
WHAT AM I
GOING TO TELL THEM?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.600
- I DON'T KNOW,
TELL THEM WHAT YOU WANT.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.267
I GOT TO GO
PICK UP THE KIDS.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.967
- KIDS--WHEN ARE WE
GOING TO SEE A DIME

04:27.967 --> 04:30.633
FROM THAT INVESTMENT?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.067
- JUST GO TALK TO THEM.

04:34.067 --> 04:37.800
I'M SURE THEY CAN HANDLE IT.
THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.733
- [imitating siren wailing]

04:45.800 --> 04:46.900
- HEY.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.533
- HEY, MAN, ALL RIGHT.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.933
SO WHAT DID
DEBRA SAY, HUH?

04:50.933 --> 04:53.000
IS SHE ON BOARD?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.500
- OH, NOT REALLY.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.367
- WHAT?

04:57.367 --> 04:59.600
- WHAT?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.567
- WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

05:01.567 --> 05:02.967
SHE SAID WE DID
A GREAT JOB.

05:02.967 --> 05:04.567
I HAD
GOOD EYE CONTACT GOING,

05:04.567 --> 05:07.600
I DID THE SUMMARY HANDS.
IT WAS KILLER STUFF.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.133
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
SHE JUST--SHE WASN'T BITING.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.500
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.000
I MEAN, YOU WANT
TO LIVE LIKE THIS

05:13.000 --> 05:16.100
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.433
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

05:17.433 --> 05:22.267
- OH, MAN,
YOUR WIFE SUCKS.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.267
- HEY, HEY, WALTER,
THAT IS NOT COOL.

05:24.267 --> 05:26.367
WE'RE STILL
IN A BUSINESS MEETING.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.867
- I'M SORRY, MAN.

05:27.867 --> 05:31.167
IT'S JUST THIS SUIT
IS SO FRIGGIN' HOT.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.500
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY, GUYS.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.533
I MEAN, YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
REALLY, YOU DID.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.467
- SO THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE OUT?

05:36.467 --> 05:38.167
- YEAH, I THINK.

05:38.167 --> 05:42.300
OH, YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
NEED THAT CHECK BACK.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.700
- WHAT?

05:44.700 --> 05:46.400
- THAT DEPOSIT I GAVE YOU
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

05:46.400 --> 05:47.600
YEAH, I'M GOING
TO NEED IT BACK.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.300
- OH, YEAH, THE DEPOSIT,
YEAH.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.167
IT'S GONE.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.133
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN GONE?

05:53.133 --> 05:54.367
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

05:54.367 --> 05:56.067
SPENT IT
ON THE WHOLE PRESENTATION--

05:56.067 --> 06:01.033
THE SUIT, THE EASEL.
THIS IS NEW.

06:01.033 --> 06:03.167
- YOU SPENT ALL OF IT--
$1,000?

06:03.167 --> 06:05.633
COME ON,
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.033
- HEY, I JUST TOLD YOU,

06:07.033 --> 06:09.933
THE ONLY REASON WE CAME HERE
TODAY WAS TO GET MORE MONEY.

06:09.933 --> 06:13.467
- OH, MY GOD, HOW AM I GONNA
TELL DEBRA I LOST $1,000?

06:13.467 --> 06:16.467
- I WOULDN'T TALK
TO HER ANYMORE.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.700
- HEY, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH ROBERT.

06:20.700 --> 06:24.100
HE STILL HAS DREAMS.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.733
- HEY, CAN I TAKE
A SHOWER HERE, MAN?

06:30.100 --> 06:32.600
- HEY, THERE, MISS TEEN USA.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.933
- HEY.

06:34.933 --> 06:36.633
- HEY.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.533
WHAT, ARE THOSE NEW SHEETS
IN THE BED THERE?

06:38.533 --> 06:41.067
THOSE LOOK NICE.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.233
- THEY'RE NOT NEW.
- OH, OH.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.500
WELL, SOMETHING ABOUT THEM
LOOKS NICE.

06:45.500 --> 06:49.133
MAYBE IT'S THE PERSON
IN THEM.

06:49.133 --> 06:52.700
- WHAT ARE YOU AFTER, RAY--
SEX OR GOLF?

06:53.800 --> 06:58.367
- NEITHER.
OH, JEEZ.

06:58.367 --> 07:03.167
CAN'T A GUY
ADMIRE LINENS?

07:05.067 --> 07:09.333
HEY, YOU KNOW, UH,
REMEMBER--

07:09.333 --> 07:11.633
REMEMBER THAT RESTAURANT
WE WENT TO IN THE CITY

07:11.633 --> 07:13.467
AND THE GUY OUT FRONT
WAS ASKING FOR MONEY

07:13.467 --> 07:16.367
AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY--
I DIDN'T HAVE CHANGE,

07:16.367 --> 07:18.300
SO YOU GAVE HIM A $5?

07:18.300 --> 07:20.767
- YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT.

07:20.767 --> 07:24.533
HE RAN AWAY AFTER YOU TRIED
TO GET IT BACK FROM HIM.

07:24.533 --> 07:26.100
- YEAH.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.867
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT HE
NEEDED IT MORE THAN WE DID,

07:28.867 --> 07:31.100
AND I STOPPED CHASING HIM.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.100
- WE ALL HAVE FOND MEMORIES
OF THAT DAY.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.900
- YEAH.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.567
YEAH, I WAS JUST
THINKING OF THAT,

07:36.567 --> 07:40.567
'CAUSE I DID
SOMETHING SIMILAR RECENTLY.

07:40.567 --> 07:44.433
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

07:44.433 --> 07:46.567
I GAVE SCOTT AND WALTER
$1,000.

07:48.867 --> 07:50.700
- WHAT?

07:50.700 --> 07:52.000
- OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW--

07:52.000 --> 07:54.567
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO GET UPSET ABOUT THIS--

07:54.567 --> 07:56.267
- MY GOD, $1,000?

07:56.267 --> 07:58.633
- REMEMBER THE HAPPY HOBO.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.267
- I GAVE HIM $5!

08:00.267 --> 08:02.933
- OKAY, BUT TO A HOBO,
THAT'S LIKE $1,000.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.467
- SO YOU GAVE SCOTT
AND WALTER MONEY

08:05.467 --> 08:06.900
AFTER I ASKED YOU NOT TO?

08:06.900 --> 08:08.367
- NO, NO, NO,

08:08.367 --> 08:10.900
I GAVE IT TO THEM
BEFORE YOU ASKED ME NOT TO.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.700
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.433
- OKAY, LISTEN, I'M SORRY.
I'LL GET THE MONEY BACK.

08:14.433 --> 08:16.033
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.

08:16.033 --> 08:17.833
- WELL, THEN I REALLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND

08:17.833 --> 08:20.667
THE HATEFUL SCREAMING.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.800
- YOU REALLY HAVE
SO LITTLE RESPECT FOR ME

08:23.800 --> 08:26.000
THAT YOU WOULD DO THAT
WITHOUT ASKING ME?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.333
- I RESPECT YOU.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.700
- OBVIOUSLY NOT,
BECAUSE YOU WROTE THE CHECK

08:28.700 --> 08:30.633
BEFORE YOU EVEN
TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.333
- THAT'S BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD SAY YES.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.500
- WELL, I'M SAYING NO.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.600
- OKAY, YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

08:38.700 --> 08:42.300
SO YOU WANT TO
GET BACK IN THE SHEETS

08:42.300 --> 08:45.567
WHERE YOU LOOK SO NICE?

08:45.567 --> 08:47.933
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS.
- OKAY.

08:47.933 --> 08:49.600
LISTEN, I SCREWED UP, OKAY?

08:49.600 --> 08:52.233
BUT I MEAN, IT'S MY MONEY
TO SCREW UP WITH.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.600
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

08:59.833 --> 09:02.533
- WITH WHICH TO SCREW UP?

09:09.967 --> 09:13.033
OH, WHAT?
WHAT DID I SAY?

09:13.033 --> 09:16.200
WHAT?

09:44.233 --> 09:47.367
IF YOU'RE DOING A LOAD,
I GOT SOME SOCKS.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.267
NO WONDER.

10:14.267 --> 10:17.633
HEY, WHY IS THIS ON 59?

10:17.633 --> 10:22.767
- I WAS HOT LAST NIGHT
WITH ALL THOSE COVERS ON ME.

10:25.733 --> 10:28.500
WHY, WERE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.400
- NO.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.100
I HAD A TOWEL AND A BATH MAT.
I SLEPT LIKE A BABY.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.400
- HERE.
- WHAT'S THIS?

10:38.400 --> 10:41.067
- A LITTLE SOMETHING
I WORKED UP LAST NIGHT.

10:41.067 --> 10:43.967
- "LAUNDRY, $75 A WEEK.

10:43.967 --> 10:47.633
GENERAL HOUSE CLEANING,
$200 A WEEK."

10:47.633 --> 10:48.867
WHAT IS THIS, A BILL?

10:48.867 --> 10:50.733
- THAT'S RIGHT.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.567
- FULL-TIME CHILD CARE,
$1,000 A WEEK.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.133
- YEAH, I GAVE YOU
A BREAK ON THAT

10:56.133 --> 10:59.567
WHEN I BILLED THE TWINS
AS ONE ITEM.

10:59.567 --> 11:02.567
- SO YOU'RE CHARGING ME NOW
TO BE THE WIFE?

11:02.567 --> 11:05.767
- WELL, IF IT'S ALL YOUR MONEY,
THEN THE WIFE SHOULD GET PAID.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.600
- UH-HUH.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.467
"PERSONAL CHEF, $300."
YEAH.

11:11.467 --> 11:15.300
I THINK WE'RE USING
THE WORD "CHEF" PRETTY LOOSELY.

11:17.433 --> 11:20.133
- HEY, THOSE GIRL SCOUT COOKIES

11:20.133 --> 11:21.767
I ORDERED FROM ALLY
COME IN YET?

11:21.767 --> 11:24.433
- NO, NOT YET.
- DAMN!

11:24.433 --> 11:28.267
AM I JONESING
FOR A TAGALONG.

11:28.267 --> 11:32.067
- HAVE A HYDROX.
TAKE THE EDGE OFF.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.733
- WAIT HERE. I'LL GET YOU
A PAIR OF RAINBOW SUSPENDERS.

11:34.733 --> 11:37.800
YOU CAN BE A RODEO CLOWN.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.633
- YEAH, WELL, IT GOT
A LITTLE CHILLY HERE LAST NIGHT.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.900
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT CAP?

11:42.900 --> 11:44.667
- OH, YEAH, KART ATTACK.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.667
I GUESS YOU AND ME
ARE PARTNERS NOW.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.633
- OH, SO YOU INVESTED, TOO?
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:49.633 --> 11:51.267
THOSE GUYS
DID A GREAT PRESENTATION,

11:51.267 --> 11:54.133
BLEW ME AWAY--
FOG MACHINE AND EVERYTHING.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.533
- SO WHERE'S YOUR HAT, RAY?

11:56.533 --> 11:59.833
WHY DON'T YOU PUT ON
YOUR $1,000 HAT?

11:59.833 --> 12:03.333
- WHY DON'T YOU POUR ME
A $300 BOWL OF CEREAL?

12:08.667 --> 12:11.300
- YOU SHOULD WEAR THE HAT, RAY--
FREE ADVERTISING.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.600
- YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN WEAR A HAT.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.500
I HAVEN'T ASKED
PERMISSION YET.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.433
- HEY, ROBERT CAN INVEST
HIS MONEY HOWEVER HE WANTS.

12:17.433 --> 12:19.300
HE'S NOT MARRIED.
HE'S ALONE.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.967
- [singing]
DOO-DAH, DOO-DAH

12:22.967 --> 12:25.333
- YEAH.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.633
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ROBERT.
YOU'RE BETTER OFF.

12:27.633 --> 12:29.433
LOOK AT THIS, HERE'S
A LIST MY WIFE GAVE ME

12:29.433 --> 12:31.300
OF WHAT SHE'S CHARGING ME
TO BE MARRIED TO HER.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.367
- WOW, YOU KNOW WHAT, DEBRA?

12:34.367 --> 12:36.233
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING.
- THANK YOU.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.700
- COME ON, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE HANDWRITING.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.900
LOOK AT WHAT
SHE'S CHARGING ME FOR.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.767
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT NUMBER RIGHT THERE?

12:41.767 --> 12:43.533
- THAT'S THE TOTAL
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.600
- THAT'S MORE THAN I EARN.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.867
- OH, YOU NOTICED THAT?

12:48.867 --> 12:51.733
- YEAH, BUT I ACTUALLY EARN IT.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.200
- HI, DEARS.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.133
DEBRA, I NEED
TO BORROW YOUR WASHER.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.433
FRANK BROKE OURS.

12:59.433 --> 13:01.300
- IT'S NOT BROKEN.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.800
JUST, BEFORE YOU PUT THAT IN,
LET ME TAKE THEIRS APART

13:03.800 --> 13:07.800
SO I CAN SEE WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.433
- LOOK, WE'RE KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING HERE,

13:09.433 --> 13:13.033
SO COULD YOU COME BACK
IN A COUPLE YEARS?

13:13.033 --> 13:14.800
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

13:14.800 --> 13:18.033
MAKING MOONSHINE
IN THE BATHTUB?

13:18.033 --> 13:19.467
- WHERE ARE THOSE NICE PAJAMAS

13:19.467 --> 13:21.633
WITH THE BASEBALL PLAYERS
I GOT YOU?

13:23.033 --> 13:24.267
WHAT'S THIS?

13:24.267 --> 13:25.800
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

13:25.800 --> 13:28.133
- HEY, YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT THAT IS, MARIE.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.900
LOOK, YOU'RE A HOMEMAKER
LIKE ME.

13:30.900 --> 13:34.000
- OKAY.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.067
- DON'T YOU THINK THAT
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO AN EQUAL SAY

13:38.067 --> 13:40.000
IN YOUR FAMILY'S
FINANCIAL DECISIONS?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.433
- ABSOLUTELY, DEAR.

13:41.433 --> 13:43.133
- OKAY, WELL, THIS IS
A LIST I PUT TOGETHER

13:43.133 --> 13:44.567
TO MAKE THAT POINT
WITH RAY.

13:44.567 --> 13:46.867
- LOOK HOW SHE PUTS
A LINE THROUGH HER SEVENS.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.633
ISN'T THAT NICE?

13:48.633 --> 13:51.500
- [chuckles]

13:51.500 --> 13:52.800
- WHAT?

13:52.800 --> 13:54.467
- WELL, JUST LOOKING THROUGH

13:54.467 --> 13:59.033
SOME OF THIS HOUSEKEEPING
THINGS YOU CLAIM YOU DO, AND...

14:01.333 --> 14:06.767
I THINK MAYBE I'M ENTITLED
TO SOME OF THIS MONEY.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.533
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
PADDING THE BILL.

14:09.533 --> 14:10.933
- LOOK, RAY, I CAN'T HELP IT

14:10.933 --> 14:13.400
IF PEOPLE BREAK IN HERE
AND CLEAN.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.333
- YEAH, WELL, THE "IN HERE"
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

14:15.333 --> 14:17.800
IS THE HOUSE WE BOUGHT
WITH MY PAYCHECK.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.733
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU'RE MORE VALUABLE THAN ME

14:19.733 --> 14:21.867
BECAUSE YOU BRING HOME
A PAYCHECK?

14:21.867 --> 14:23.133
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.733
I THINK SOCIETY SAYS THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.833
YOU SHOULD TALK TO THEM.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.467
- ACTUALLY, RAYMOND,

14:28.467 --> 14:30.133
THE BEST WAY TO DETERMINE
THE VALUE OF SOMEONE'S LIFE

14:30.133 --> 14:31.800
IS WITH A WRONGFUL-DEATH
SETTLEMENT.

14:31.800 --> 14:36.667
- WELL, GOOD, GOOD,
'CAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE ONE.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.067
- NO, REALLY, I DATED A
WRONGFUL-DEATH CLAIMS ADJUSTER,

14:40.067 --> 14:41.300
AND IT WAS HER JOB
TO FIGURE OUT

14:41.300 --> 14:42.733
WHAT A JURY
WOULD AWARD A FAMILY

14:42.733 --> 14:45.000
IF A LOVED ONE WERE KILLED
IN AN ACCIDENT--

14:45.000 --> 14:46.833
IN OTHER WORDS,
WHAT THEY WERE WORTH.

14:46.833 --> 14:49.300
IT'S FASCINATING TO SEE
WHAT SHE HAD TO CONSIDER.

14:49.300 --> 14:53.367
TOO MORBID FOR A SECOND DATE,
BUT FASCINATING.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.000
- WHAT?
LIKE WHAT?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.367
- WELL, LIKE THEY CONSIDER
WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU WERE.

14:57.367 --> 15:00.767
TAKE, UH, DAD, FOR EXAMPLE.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.467
LET'S SAY SOMEONE
DROPPED A PIANO ON HIM.

15:03.467 --> 15:07.100
- OKAY.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.733
- THE JURY WOULD BE ASKED
TO CONSIDER

15:08.733 --> 15:10.100
WHAT KIND OF LIFE HE LED.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.733
WAS HE A HAPPY PERSON?

15:11.733 --> 15:13.233
DID HE BRING JOY TO OTHERS?

15:13.233 --> 15:15.333
DID HE STOP
AND SMELL THE ROSES?

15:15.333 --> 15:18.800
- YES, YES, AND YES.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.067
- YOU DON'T ENJOY LIFE.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.967
YOU SPEND THREE HOURS
EVERY AFTERNOON

15:21.967 --> 15:23.700
LOCKED IN THE BATHROOM.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.067
- HIDING FROM YOU.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.467
THAT'S HOW I ENJOY LIFE.

15:29.600 --> 15:33.333
- SO WE CAN ASSUME
HE WOULDN'T FETCH MUCH.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.800
MOM WOULD FARE SLIGHTLY BETTER,

15:34.800 --> 15:36.933
BECAUSE THEY FACTOR IN
PAIN AND SUFFERING.

15:36.933 --> 15:39.167
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT, WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE WORTH, OKAY?

15:39.167 --> 15:41.033
BUT WHO WOULD WIN
BETWEEN ME AND DEBRA?

15:41.033 --> 15:43.433
- OH, WELL, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT DEATH HERE, RAYMOND.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.500
THERE'S REALLY NO WINNING.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.567
- OKAY, YEAH,
WHO'S WORTH MORE?

15:47.567 --> 15:49.233
- WELL,
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

15:49.233 --> 15:51.167
I MEAN, THE JURY COULD LOOK
AT ALMOST ANYTHING.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.767
FOR EXAMPLE, DID YOU KNOW
THAT THEY'RE MORE SYMPATHETIC

15:53.767 --> 15:55.700
TO AN ATTRACTIVE PERSON?

15:55.700 --> 15:58.333
- SAY GOOD NIGHT, RAYMO.

16:05.733 --> 16:08.733
- I'M SURE IF DEBRA'S LIFE
WAS PRESENTED TO A JURY,

16:08.733 --> 16:10.800
THEY WOULD SEE
THAT SHE WAS VERY ACTIVE...

16:10.800 --> 16:12.267
- YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.867
- THAT SHE WORKED OUT,
SHE WAS HEALTHY, SPIRITED,

16:14.867 --> 16:16.200
SHE HAD A ZEST FOR LIFE.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.900
- GOT IT.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.833
- AND THEY WOULD ALSO
BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO DEBRA

16:19.833 --> 16:22.700
BECAUSE SHE IS THE PRIMARY
CAREGIVER AND NURTURER.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.333
- I WIN.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.333
- WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

16:27.333 --> 16:31.900
- WELL, RAYMOND, I GUESS
YOU'RE THE FINANCIAL PROVIDER.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.600
- YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT.
I MAKE THE CHEDDAR, BABY.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.833
YEAH, WHAT ELSE?

16:36.833 --> 16:40.000
- UM...

16:40.000 --> 16:42.467
I DON'T KNOW.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.733
- COME ON.
I-I ENJOY LIFE.

16:49.733 --> 16:51.167
I HAVE A ZEST FOR LIFE.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.367
I'M TOTALLY ZESTY.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.133
HOW ABOUT
MY SENSE OF HUMOR, HUH?

16:55.133 --> 16:56.867
HOW ABOUT THAT?

16:56.867 --> 16:58.367
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

16:58.367 --> 17:00.967
- I HAVE A GOOD ONE.
I HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.100
- THAT IS TRUE.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.200
TELL ONE OF YOUR JOKES, DEAR.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.600
- WHICH ONE?

17:05.600 --> 17:06.633
- OH, TELL THE ONE

17:06.633 --> 17:08.600
ABOUT THE GUY
WHO GOES INTO A BAR

17:08.600 --> 17:11.233
AND HE SEES
THERE'S A DISH OF PEANUTS

17:11.233 --> 17:13.000
THAT SAYS NICE THINGS
TO HIM,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.800
AND HE ASKS THE BARTENDER,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.267
"WHAT'S WITH THESE PEANUTS?"

17:16.267 --> 17:19.033
AND THE BARTENDER SAYS,
"THEY'RE COMPLIMENTARY."

17:19.033 --> 17:22.667
[laughs]

17:22.667 --> 17:25.767
TELL THAT ONE, DEAR.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.267
- YOU JUST TOLD IT, MA.

17:27.267 --> 17:29.067
- NO, NO, NO,
YOU TELL IT SO FUNNY.

17:29.067 --> 17:31.733
- WELL, YOU JUST
TOLD THE ENDING, MA.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.300
- WELL, TELL THE BEGINNING.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.700
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU--
- I'M NOT TELLING THE JOKE,

17:34.700 --> 17:36.100
BECAUSE YOU
BLEW THE PUNCH LINE,

17:36.100 --> 17:37.833
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
- ALL RIGHT.

17:37.833 --> 17:40.267
- WHAT A ZEST FOR LIFE.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.867
- SHE SAID,
"THEY'RE COMPLIMENTARY."

17:41.867 --> 17:44.100
THAT'S THE WHOLE JOKE.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.133
- AW, STOP DEFENDING YOURSELF.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.200
YOU BRING HOME THE PAYCHECK.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.533
WHOEVER BRINGS HOME
THE MONEY

17:49.533 --> 17:52.200
IS THE KING,
END OF STORY.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.500
- WELL PUT, FATHER.
YOU SEE?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.100
HE CAN DO WHATEVER
HE WANTS WITH THE MONEY.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.100
- MARIE, DOESN'T THAT
BOTHER YOU?

17:57.100 --> 17:58.833
- SHE HAS NO CHOICE
IN THE MATTER.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.167
I AM THE KING.

18:02.167 --> 18:06.267
AND NOW HIS MAJESTY
WILL RETIRE TO HIS CASTLE,

18:06.267 --> 18:07.467
WHERE HE WILL AWAIT

18:07.467 --> 18:10.400
THE ROYAL
GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH.

18:11.867 --> 18:12.867
COME, OAF.

18:12.867 --> 18:16.767
YOU AMUSE ME.

18:19.267 --> 18:22.267
- I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL.

18:26.233 --> 18:28.167
- MARIE, HOW COULD YOU
LET HIM TALK THAT WAY?

18:28.167 --> 18:29.300
- FRANK CAN SAY
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.067
HE NEVER
CONTROLLED THE MONEY.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.367
WHEN HE BROUGHT HOME
A PAYCHECK,

18:32.367 --> 18:34.267
I DID WHATEVER I WANTED
WITH IT.

18:34.267 --> 18:35.967
- WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:35.967 --> 18:37.633
DAD HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THAT?

18:37.633 --> 18:39.567
- OH, NO,
SOMETIMES HE'D GET NOSY,

18:39.567 --> 18:41.133
BUT I'D MAKE HIM
A HEAVY DINNER,

18:41.133 --> 18:42.667
AND THEN HE'D FALL ASLEEP
ON THE COUCH

18:42.667 --> 18:46.733
AND I STARTED MOVING
THE MONEY AROUND.

18:46.733 --> 18:50.100
- DIABOLICAL.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.267
- IT'S AMAZING
HOW CLUELESS HE IS.

18:52.267 --> 18:54.500
DO YOU KNOW THAT
FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS

18:54.500 --> 18:56.433
I'VE BEEN GIVING MONEY
TO BUY BOOKS

18:56.433 --> 18:58.667
FOR CHILDREN
IN SOUTH AMERICA? YEAH.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.867
YOU THINK YOUR FATHER
WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF THAT?

19:00.867 --> 19:04.267
- HE DIDN'T LIKE
BUYING US BOOKS.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.867
- HE NEVER KNEW ABOUT
ALL THAT MONEY I SAVED

19:08.867 --> 19:10.200
FOR OUR TRIP TO ITALY,

19:10.200 --> 19:11.900
AND, DEBRA,
I NEVER TOLD FRANK

19:11.900 --> 19:14.300
ABOUT THE LOAN
I GAVE YOU TWO.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.800
- WHAT LOAN?
- UH, THAT'S OKAY, MARIE.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.133
- WHEN YOU FIRST GOT MARRIED

19:20.133 --> 19:21.433
AND YOU WERE LIVING
IN THAT APARTMENT.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.667
- WHAT LOAN?
- NO, IT WASN'T MUCH.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.100
IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE SOMETHING

19:25.100 --> 19:27.000
TO GET US
OVER A ROUGH SPOT.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.033
- YES, DEAR.
IT WAS JUST $2,500.

19:29.033 --> 19:31.033
- WHOO!

19:31.033 --> 19:32.500
- $2,500?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
YOU NEVER
TOLD ME ABOUT THAT.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.000
- YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE NEEDED NEW TIRES,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.667
AND THE DISHWASHER
WAS BROKEN,

19:37.667 --> 19:39.233
AND YOU HADN'T
GOTTEN YOUR BONUS YET,

19:39.233 --> 19:40.800
AND YOU WERE DOING
THE BEST YOU COULD.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.367
- SO YOU WENT TO MY MOTHER?

19:42.367 --> 19:43.800
- NO, I TOLD DEBRA SHE DIDN'T
HAVE TO PAY ME BACK.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.233
I MEAN, SHE'S FAMILY,

19:45.233 --> 19:46.767
AND YOU CAN'T
PUT A PRICE ON LOVE,

19:46.767 --> 19:48.567
AND ANYWAY, I'M NOT
THE KIND OF PERSON--

19:48.567 --> 19:52.633
- I PAID HER BACK
IN TWO WEEKS.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.500
- YOUR LIFE MADE POSSIBLE
BY A GRANT

19:54.500 --> 19:58.567
FROM THE MARIE BARONE
FOUNDATION.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.000
- OH, MY GOD.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.433
WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO?

20:06.433 --> 20:10.233
WHAT ELSE DON'T I KNOW ABOUT?
- NOTHING.

20:10.233 --> 20:11.400
- WELL, COME ON,
IF YOU CAN DO THINGS

20:11.400 --> 20:12.833
LIKE BORROW MONEY
FROM MY MOTHER,

20:12.833 --> 20:14.733
WHAT OTHER MONEY STUFF
DON'T I KNOW ABOUT?

20:14.733 --> 20:17.233
- NOTHING.

20:17.233 --> 20:19.633
LOOK, YOU DID
THE GO-KART THING,

20:19.633 --> 20:22.500
AND I DID THE THING
WITH YOUR MOTHER THAT ONE TIME,

20:22.500 --> 20:25.000
SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE EVEN.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.067
- WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

20:29.067 --> 20:30.633
- LOOK AROUND, RAYMOND.
YOU GOT IT GOOD.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.567
WHATEVER SHE'S DOING
IS WORKING.

20:32.567 --> 20:35.500
- NO, NO, NO, REALLY,
WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.467
- RAYMOND.

20:36.467 --> 20:37.667
- NO, NO, LISTEN,
I WANT TO KNOW--

20:37.667 --> 20:38.733
- HEY, LISTEN, CUBBY,

20:38.733 --> 20:40.200
WHEN THE LITTLE MONKEY
RINGS A BELL

20:40.200 --> 20:41.633
AND THE PELLET COMES OUT,

20:41.633 --> 20:43.433
HE DOESN'T ASK
HOW THE PELLET GOT THERE.

20:43.433 --> 20:47.233
HE JUST ENJOYS THE PELLET.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.767
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:59.767 --> 21:02.333
I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE THAT
WE SHOULD CONSULT EACH OTHER

21:02.333 --> 21:04.300
NOW ON ALL THE MONEY STUFF,
OKAY?

21:04.300 --> 21:05.667
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY, SURE.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.533
- THAT'S SO NICE.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.333
- HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO SIT ON THE COUCH?

21:09.333 --> 21:11.800
I'LL MAKE YOU
A NICE MEAL, OKAY?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.733
- ALL RIGHT.

21:13.733 --> 21:18.600
- NICE AND HEAVY.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.833
- LISTEN, I WANT TO BE INCLUDED
IN EVERYTHING, OKAY?

21:20.833 --> 21:22.200
IN ALL THE DECISIONS, OKAY?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.600
- DEFINITELY.
- LET'S GO.

21:24.600 --> 21:28.267
- I WORK FOR HER, DON'T I?
- MM-HMM.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.233
- HEY, MARIE,

21:36.233 --> 21:38.600
WHO THE HELL
IS MIGUEL VELASQUEZ,

21:38.600 --> 21:41.833
AND WHAT IS THIS CRAP
HE'S SAYING

21:41.833 --> 21:45.100
ABOUT "CURIOUS GEORGE"?

21:45.100 --> 21:48.467
- I GOT TURKEY TETRAZZINI.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.733
- OH, HEY.
