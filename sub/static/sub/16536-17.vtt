00:01.043 --> 00:03.462
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:08.259
My sources say MacLeish overrode the FBI,
preventing them from taking Lozano alive.

00:08.384 --> 00:10.803
Why would he go out of his way
to silence the man

00:10.928 --> 00:11.971
who attempted to murder the president?

00:12.096 --> 00:15.808
<i>I brought this to show the White House
that any effort to interfere</i>

00:15.933 --> 00:17.810
<i>in the Second Amendment rights
will fail.</i>

00:17.935 --> 00:20.813
I know you're facing an uphill climb.
What if we could help?

00:20.938 --> 00:22.815
- And what's in it for Hookstraten?
- Think about it.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.150
Vice President.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.652
Kimble, I'm not in a position
to make promises right now.

00:26.777 --> 00:30.322
- I would be very grateful down the line.
- That's all I need to know, Mr. President.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.657
The yeas are 51,

00:31.782 --> 00:33.117
<i>and the nays are 49.</i>

00:33.242 --> 00:35.578
- It passes!
- We won! Congratulations.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.997
These look like the bombs
used to blow up the Capitol.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.958
There's enough explosives in here
to blow up three Capitols.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.746
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:26.003 --> 01:28.047
It is necessary to take precautions.

01:28.172 --> 01:31.759
All right, I-I understand.
Thank you for seeing me.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.886
Just...

01:34.011 --> 01:35.554
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, just...

01:35.679 --> 01:38.015
Easy, easy, just so I can see, okay?

01:38.140 --> 01:40.226
And... And I'm gonna take notes.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.144
That's it.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.687
I'm old. You understand.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.022
I need...

01:45.147 --> 01:46.357
Oh, God.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.657
Do you know who this man is?

01:59.036 --> 02:02.039
Mr. Lozano, he shot our President.

02:03.707 --> 02:07.920
I was told by f-friends of yours
that he was in contact with Al-Sakar,

02:08.044 --> 02:10.923
the group that blew up the U.S. Capitol.

02:15.386 --> 02:17.805
Al-Sakar blew up nothing.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.932
They didn't?

02:21.976 --> 02:24.562
So, wha... who did?

02:27.022 --> 02:28.524
You don't know?

02:35.406 --> 02:38.242
The American Satan
has enemies everywhere.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.788
So, tell me, why would Al-Sakar take
credit knowing the U.S. military

02:42.913 --> 02:45.749
would never stop hunting them down?

02:53.090 --> 02:54.758
He paid them.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.263
He paid Al-Sakar?

03:06.604 --> 03:08.647
These aren't Army surplus
explosives, Foerstel.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.608
These are battlefield-ready.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.235
Yeah, we're assessing it now.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.363
- What about "NVWS"?
- And "NVWS"?

03:17.781 --> 03:20.826
So far, no known terror organizations
match those initials.

03:20.951 --> 03:25.080
We also found a motion sensor with a
limited-range transmitter attached to it,

03:25.206 --> 03:28.000
so whoever's watching this place
is within 20 miles.

03:28.125 --> 03:32.004
Nearest town to you is Driggs,
population 600.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.131
Yeah, we're headed there next.
What about the silo?

03:34.256 --> 03:37.134
We'll maintain aerial surveillance,
and we'll assemble a team to go in.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.304
- Not until I give you my word.
- We need to seize this ordinance.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.681
Well, we also need
to figure out why this is here.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.308
Until then, we can't tip our hand.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.063
<i>- Foerstel?</i>
- Affirmative.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.274
All right, we'll be in contact
when we get to Driggs.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.820
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:56.946 --> 03:57.863
I have some good news.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.032
Looks like the House is gonna pass
the gun-control bill.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.033
Speaker Hookstraten came through.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.369
She still has a bit of work to do
with the Republicans,

04:03.494 --> 04:05.204
but she's assured me
that she'll get there.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.498
Aaron's gonna give me an update
of vote count this afternoon.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.540
Okay, great.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.876
We should talk about
the vice presidency, though.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.462
There's a growing buzz
of a quid pro quo in the works.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.714
I was absolutely clear.
I made no promises.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.966
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.302
I know, but we need
to manage expectations.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.721
I'd like to be clear when
I speak to Aaron this afternoon

04:22.846 --> 04:25.849
- that we are keeping our options open.
- Okay, fine.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.979
Unbelievable.
I was looking for these all last night.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.690
Look, I want us to stay focused
on the Supreme Court right now.

04:32.815 --> 04:36.652
- Absolutely. Julia Rombauer is waiting.
- Great.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.741
- Julia, please come on in.
- Mr. President.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.743
- Getting any sleep?
- No.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.496
But I managed to go six weeks
without it so far.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.707
Wouldn't want to break the streak now.

04:50.541 --> 04:55.170
Your nine Supreme Court nominees,
all vetted by the working group.

04:55.296 --> 04:58.382
- I can't believe this hasn't leaked.
- I can't believe we've gotten this far.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.717
It's all because of Julia.

04:59.842 --> 05:03.012
Meaning I can still be intimidating
when I want to be.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.097
No, it's a testament
to your leadership skills.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.600
When I was an associate professor
at Columbia, Julia was in charge.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.436
She was my role model.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.272
She's the reason why I wanted to become
President of the University one day.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.274
Well, it's good training.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.609
If you think national politics is tough,

05:17.735 --> 05:19.611
try academia.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.780
Well, we're meeting with
the Senate leadership in 20 minutes.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.532
Assuming we get a consensus,
the plan is

05:23.657 --> 05:25.367
to announce the slate
to the press tomorrow night.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.953
Well, I've kept the leadership
informed throughout the process.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.621
In principle, they all agree

05:29.747 --> 05:32.291
to the idea of four progressives
to satisfy the Democrats,

05:32.416 --> 05:34.793
four conservatives
to satisfy the Republicans,

05:34.918 --> 05:39.465
and a ninth judge, a true and impartial
independent, like Tom here.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.967
I just need to get them
to sign off on the actual names.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.261
And then go through
the formal confirmation process.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.305
Yes, but that should be reasonably short

05:46.430 --> 05:48.932
with the full support
of both parties going in.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.142
Let's hope you're right.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.770
I haven't worked this hard to be wrong.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.816
Joanne, get me actual numbers
on the families

05:57.941 --> 06:00.235
who were impacted
by the proposed estate-tax changes.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.653
I want something more than estimates.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.739
We'll have it on your desk
by this afternoon.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.203
I never liked "impacted" as a verb.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.579
Geez. Get out.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.831
The only things that should
get impacted are teeth.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.250
- Now.
- Ah, good to see you, too.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.128
- What, you didn't miss me, huh?
- I didn't notice.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.964
Oh, I've been working on a story, Seth.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.134
Yeah, for the <i>New York Standard.</i>

06:25.219 --> 06:27.096
- That's a pretty good forgery.
- Funny.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.265
Fact is they sent me to the Middle East
and Asia to look into Al-Sakar.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.811
See, I would never publish
a story so <i>impactful</i>

06:33.936 --> 06:35.813
without giving you a chance
to comment first.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.403
Can we please dispense
with the dramatic pause?

06:43.237 --> 06:45.489
Al-Sakar didn't
blow up the Capitol.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.118
They didn't have the money.
They didn't have the people.

06:49.243 --> 06:52.246
They didn't have the smarts
to take it out.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.331
You guys were played.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.792
According to whom?
Unnamed sources?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.335
No, I'll name them.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.712
Meantime, you got today
to get back to me with a response

07:00.838 --> 07:03.132
because this is going out tomorrow.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.895
Tell the Secretary of Commerce
we need more diversity

07:17.020 --> 07:20.023
for the young entrepreneurs
presser next month. Thank you.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.443
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

07:25.863 --> 07:27.072
So, major flag for you.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.909
Abe Leonard's running with the story
that Al-Sakar didn't blow up the Capitol.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.412
What? That's crazy.
We have the FBI, the CIA,

07:33.537 --> 07:35.581
and half a dozen other agencies
on record saying they did.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.750
I know, and the last time Leonard
ran with a story that I thought was crazy,

07:38.876 --> 07:40.085
and then POTUS confirmed it. Remember?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.754
If he's right about this, that
means our SEALs took out the wrong guys

07:42.880 --> 07:44.590
and the real Capitol bombers
are still out there.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.550
Okay, slow down.
Do you have anyone at <i>Teen Mode</i>

07:46.675 --> 07:48.427
you can reach out to,
see how real the story is?

07:48.552 --> 07:51.430
Abe's not at <i>Teen Mode</i> anymore.
He's writing for the <i>New York Standard,</i>

07:51.555 --> 07:53.724
- which has an audience 25 times the size.
- You haven't seen the story?

07:53.849 --> 07:56.185
No, he wanted a reaction
to the allegations first.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.561
- I'll flag POTUS.
- Em.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.770
Yeah?

07:58.896 --> 08:00.439
I don't want the White House
embarrassed by this,

08:00.564 --> 08:02.232
especially now that things
are finally going our way.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.067
You and me both.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.744
Good afternoon.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.622
I want to take a moment
to thank you all

08:16.747 --> 08:19.416
and congratulate you
on accomplishing something

08:19.541 --> 08:20.959
that's never been done before:

08:21.084 --> 08:24.129
seating nine justices
to the High Court at the same time.

08:24.254 --> 08:28.926
This is an act of bipartisan cooperation
that I believe will go down in history.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.095
So congratulations to you all.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.557
Let's get started.
Senator Hunter.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.644
Mr. President, I appreciate
you including us in the process,

08:38.769 --> 08:43.106
and I commend Ms. Rombauer
for her extraordinary leadership.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.651
We believe you have come up
with a well-balanced slate,

08:45.776 --> 08:49.947
including a Chief Justice who can act as
an impartial, potentially deciding voice.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.240
Thank you.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.076
I think we might have a bit
of a problem there, Mr. President.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.285
What kind of problem?

08:55.410 --> 08:58.830
I'll let my distinguished colleague
from Montana explain.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.792
Thank you. Mr. President, my staff
has been looking into your choice

09:01.917 --> 09:03.961
for Chief Justice, Judge Borda,

09:04.086 --> 09:06.255
and we've made
some disturbing discoveries.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.008
These names have already been approved

09:10.133 --> 09:11.843
by a working group
from within your own party.

09:11.969 --> 09:15.472
Well, nevertheless, this nominee
clearly shows liberal bias.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.182
Senator, it's too late to pull
this kind of stunt.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.850
No, we have an agreement.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.103
Our third branch of government
needs to be reinstated.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.855
Oh, yes, sir.
But you already have a Senate,

09:23.981 --> 09:25.607
one with a Republican majority.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.444
And I'm saying that we need to start with
a list of five justices acceptable to us

09:29.570 --> 09:30.946
and then go forward from there.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.156
- That is not what we agreed to.
- We have the votes.

09:37.661 --> 09:40.163
Sir, my approach will get you
a speedy confirmation.

09:40.289 --> 09:45.294
Otherwise, well, we might be forced
to hold up all your nominees.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.713
Mr. President, Senator Bowman
might still be smarting

09:47.838 --> 09:49.881
- from his loss on the gun bill--
- I object to that.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.175
--but if we go with his formula,
our side will filibuster.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.720
Then I guess we're done here.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.014
- I guess we are.
- Everybody, please, just take your seats.

09:57.139 --> 09:58.890
Please, take your...

09:59.016 --> 10:01.768
I said take your seats now!

10:09.693 --> 10:14.031
I'm sorry for losing my temper,
but I have lost my temper.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.619
Shame on you, Senator Bowman.
Shame on you.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.913
Our nation is in crisis.

10:22.039 --> 10:25.334
Do you have any idea how many cases
are on the current docket

10:25.459 --> 10:28.712
that can't be resolved because
we don't have a Supreme Court?

10:28.837 --> 10:33.342
126 issues that go
to the core of our democracy.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.803
Civil rights, immigration,
campaign-finance reform.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.265
Without a court to adjudicate
the laws of this land,

10:40.390 --> 10:42.809
we are a broken government, sir.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.313
Now, this was a fair deal.

10:47.856 --> 10:51.735
Every single person in this room
has something to claim victory over.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.447
I'm not gonna let you hijack that, sir.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.908
And if you're willing to play politics
with people's lives,

10:58.033 --> 11:01.787
trust me, I am more than willing to walk
down that hall to my press room

11:01.912 --> 11:04.206
and call you out
in front of the entire world

11:04.331 --> 11:07.459
for trying to hold
our justice system hostage...

11:07.584 --> 11:11.088
...at a time when we need it most.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.298
I would think twice, Senator.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.259
I would seriously think twice...

11:17.094 --> 11:19.971
before making yourself
the poster child of obstructionism.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.057
Excuse me, Mr. President.

11:22.182 --> 11:26.478
But doing whatever I can
to ensure a fair and balanced court

11:26.603 --> 11:28.980
hardly makes me an obstructionist.

11:29.106 --> 11:33.193
Point of fact, it's doing exactly
what I was appointed to do.

11:35.278 --> 11:40.784
Gentlemen, this is obviously
a very emotional issue.

11:40.909 --> 11:44.496
Everyone in this room knows how hard
you've worked on this, Mr. President,

11:44.621 --> 11:47.165
but in the interest
of all those involved,

11:47.290 --> 11:50.168
would it be too much to ask
for you to put forward

11:50.293 --> 11:52.462
another name for that ninth seat?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.304
No, I can do that.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.685
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.983
For a second, I thought
it was all gonna fall apart.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.860
Who the hell says it hasn't?

12:14.985 --> 12:18.238
We need to find a name
that son of a bitch can't say no to.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.751
Not a lot of street life here.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.587
Not a lot of anything.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.173
Still, they get visitors.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.759
New Mexico.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.970
Georgia.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.931
Texas.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.352
People drive a long way
to get to the middle of nowhere.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.579
Hi.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.663
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.749
- Hear a storm's coming.
- Really?

13:10.874 --> 13:14.377
Yeah, we, um... we haven't watched
the weather report in a while.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.259
So what brings you to Driggs?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.805
We're just, um...
just heading up the mountain.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.850
- You take care now.
- Okay, you too.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.939
Well, if that was a test,
I think we just failed that one.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.524
Well, we're marked now.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.739
New York plates.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.411
Hey, Jason.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.130
What about Semegran?

13:59.256 --> 14:02.968
Yeah, he's got the qualifications, but
he's 64 and he smokes two packs a day.

14:03.093 --> 14:06.137
Just can't believe one man
would exploit Constitutional crisis

14:06.263 --> 14:07.639
for political advancement.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.057
He knows the list was balanced

14:09.182 --> 14:11.142
and that I wasn't trying
to push a political agenda.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.895
He's trying to put himself
at the center of his own damn party.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.982
How did Bowman get so powerful?
Didn't he lose the Senate vote to you?

14:17.107 --> 14:18.066
Yeah.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.318
But he managed to win over a block
of conservative senators,

14:20.443 --> 14:23.154
which consolidated his power,
making him the darling of the far right.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.323
So, when he claims
he wants a balanced court,

14:25.448 --> 14:28.326
what he's really saying is that he just
wants a court that agrees with him.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.830
- You cannot let him win this, Tom.
- I'm not planning on it.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.511
Hello?

14:46.636 --> 14:47.971
- Hello?
- Oh, hey.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.682
- Hi.
- You folks need some menus?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.934
- Sure.
- Sure, thank you.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.315
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.985
- Is there a ski area around here?
- You see any mountains nearby?

15:02.110 --> 15:06.364
No, we just see a lot of cars
with out-of-state plates. Just curious.

15:06.489 --> 15:09.492
You're talking about the True Believers.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.121
- The what?
- Well, that's what we call them.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.875
They get together on a private property
three or four times a year, maybe.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.461
- They stick together.
- Hmm.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.547
They pay cash, though.
No credit cards.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.883
Strange bunch.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.885
So what exactly
do they do out there?

15:27.010 --> 15:29.471
Nobody knows, really.
Uh, a bit of camping.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.348
You know, they light bonfires.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.183
How do you know
they light bonfires?

15:33.308 --> 15:36.519
- Well, you can see the glow.
- Where exactly is this property?

15:36.645 --> 15:38.813
It's a huge spread.
Used to belong to the Air Force.

15:38.939 --> 15:43.193
- Oh. Where the missile silos are.
- Hmm.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.072
I'm former Air Force.

15:47.197 --> 15:50.241
E-5 with the third bomber wing
at Clarendon.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.576
- For real?
- Yes, sir.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.870
Well, man, I miss those Stratoforts.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.539
They moved them all up
to Minot years ago.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.167
We keep thinking
they might reopen the base.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.253
Uh, you hear trucks moving
through at night occasionally,

16:02.379 --> 16:04.547
choppers, too.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.759
Ah, who am I kidding?

16:07.884 --> 16:10.387
Air Force is never coming back.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.848
- Yeah.
- So, tell us, what's good?

16:15.809 --> 16:18.561
Hartnett and Sherburne
put us 20 votes on top.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.855
The gun bill will pass.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.857
You think Kirkman's
gonna come through with VP?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.609
Well, I'm meeting
with Emily Rhodes today.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.570
- That's the next thing on the agenda.
- Knock, knock.

16:28.238 --> 16:32.617
Come on in, Abe.
You know my new strategist, Aaron Shore.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.828
- Abe Leonard.
- Hey.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.288
- It's a pleasure.
- Pleasure's mine, Mr. Shore.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.456
I've been wanting to ask you

16:38.581 --> 16:40.542
why you jumped off the good ship
Kirkman as Chief of Staff.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.586
- It was amicable.
- Well, you didn't answer my question.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.090
And I don't intend to.
I'm happy with my current position.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.551
He's good.
Is it all right if he hears this?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.469
I trust him, if that's what you mean.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.265
Okay, 'cause I got a few torpedoes
to fire at his old boss.

16:55.390 --> 17:00.103
Abe, you are aware that I am allied with
the President on this gun legislation.

17:00.228 --> 17:04.315
Yeah, smart move, too, setting yourself up
as a moderate alternative to Bowman,

17:04.441 --> 17:06.108
but this isn't about politics.

17:06.233 --> 17:10.280
This is about our old friend,
the late Vice President Peter MacLeish.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.949
MacLeish?

17:14.284 --> 17:17.287
I heard you delayed
his confirmation vote as VP.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.289
Who told you that?

17:19.414 --> 17:21.790
Does it matter?
What I want to know is why.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.671
My sources say you were waiting
for some evidence from an FBI agent.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.132
We're getting into matters
of national security here.

17:29.257 --> 17:32.594
Yeah, I'll make it easy for you.
Her name is Agent Hannah Wells.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.429
Does that name mean anything to you?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.890
I can't comment.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.683
Can't or won't?

17:38.808 --> 17:41.686
- You're crossing a line, Abe.
- All right, look.

17:41.811 --> 17:45.982
If I'm wrong, just tell me so,
but I'll use your denial in my story.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.990
I refuse to comment
on an ongoing investigation.

17:56.659 --> 17:57.744
That'll work.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.248
Be seeing you.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.545
That guy's dangerous.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.590
Which is why I keep him close.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.857
Yes. Agent Hannah Wells, please.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.705
Mr. Shore.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.710
- What do you want?
- It's what you want.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.838
You called Hannah Wells twice
in the last three hours.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.256
How'd you know that?

18:51.381 --> 18:53.716
She's on administrative leave.
Her calls get bounced to me.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.596
Whatever it is, you can say it to me.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.473
You know we'd get along
a whole lot better

19:00.598 --> 19:02.767
if you just accept the fact
that we're on the same side.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.519
Oh, now we're on the same side?

19:04.644 --> 19:07.188
You... you interrogated me
like I was some sort of criminal.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.065
You want me to apologize for that?

19:09.190 --> 19:11.568
You more than anybody
should appreciate the magnitude

19:11.693 --> 19:13.069
of what we're dealing with here.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.533
So, you want to tell me
what you know or not?

19:22.162 --> 19:24.038
Abe Leonard knows
that Agent Wells

19:24.164 --> 19:26.791
tried to delay Vice President
MacLeish's confirmation vote.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.128
Speaker Hookstraten tell him?

19:30.253 --> 19:33.047
Mm, according to Aaron Shore,
Leonard tried to get her to confirm.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.633
- And did she?
- No, she refused to comment.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.802
But, Mr. President, bottom line,

19:37.927 --> 19:39.971
we can't allow Leonard
to go public with what he knows.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.973
It could completely
derail our investigation.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.726
- What do you suggest?
- I'm suggesting we bring him in.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.477
On what grounds?

19:46.603 --> 19:50.565
Someone is feeding him classified
information. We need to find out who.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.318
And if he refuses to give up his source,
we get him on contempt.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.404
- Lying to a federal officer is a felony.
- Absolutely not.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.782
We're not arresting reporters
for doing their job.

19:59.908 --> 20:02.619
This is not a First Amendment issue.
This is an issue of national security.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.496
If Leonard publishes, the people
behind this conspiracy are gonna go dark,

20:05.622 --> 20:07.415
and we are never gonna find them.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.960
Mr. President, we don't have a choice.
We have to bring him in.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.673
Director Foerstel,
we always have a choice.

20:15.798 --> 20:19.928
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to let this one ride out,

20:20.053 --> 20:22.430
see what Leonard comes up with.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.100
Price of living in a free society.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.770
So how's it going
over there with Hookstraten?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.648
Not bad. Could be better
if she heard from POTUS.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.358
What do you mean?

20:33.483 --> 20:35.526
She delivered on her promise
with the gun bill,

20:35.652 --> 20:38.196
so we feel the President
should deliver on his.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.447
Whoa.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.200
President didn't promise the Speaker
anything more than gratitude.

20:42.325 --> 20:43.868
What, are you kidding me?

20:43.993 --> 20:47.205
- No. If the bill passes--
- When it passes.

20:47.330 --> 20:52.210
If it passes, then the White House
will definitely owe the Speaker a debt.

20:52.335 --> 20:55.463
- Well, yeah, the VP slot.
- It's a possibility, Aaron.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.839
It's not a certainty.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.884
Well, that's not her understanding,
Emily.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.011
Well, then, she wasn't listening.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.056
Well, she's gonna be
very disappointed to hear that.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.557
Well, the Speaker's a big girl.

21:06.683 --> 21:10.228
And backing the bill made sense for her
without quid pro quo.

21:10.353 --> 21:13.064
She's drawn moderates
and independents into her corner.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.025
Now suddenly, Bowman has serious
competition within his own party.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.987
Well, getting his bill out of the Senate
was largely due to her efforts.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.489
It was a big factor,
but it wasn't the only factor.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.200
Are... are you really gonna
play hardball on this?

21:25.118 --> 21:28.162
Absolutely.
It's my job to protect the President.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.499
You know that better than anyone,
and we've got to keep our options open.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.210
Get the bill passed,
and we can talk again.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.053
Bad news, Abe.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.847
New York kicked this back.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.098
What?

21:47.223 --> 21:49.684
They like the direction you're going,
but they say it's not enough.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.937
Not enough that Al-Sakar
didn't blow up the Capitol?

21:53.062 --> 21:55.606
- It's conjecture.
- Wh-- I got named sources.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.275
Yeah, two terrorist leaders.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.111
Yeah, exactly, who I risked my life
to get to, by the way.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.031
I know, and it's excellent color.
But it's not news.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.074
New York says these terrorist groups
all hate each other.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.909
Of course they'd say
Al-Sakar didn't do it.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.829
Well, what about Mohammed Sherif
fingering Nestor Lozano as the middle man?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.625
- I've run with far less in the past.
- I know.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.753
Shoddy sourcing is what got you fired
off the <i>Herald.</i>

22:17.545 --> 22:20.381
- You got another shot here. Don't blow it.
- Unbelievable.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.924
Calm down.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.469
I'm the one who hired you
for this assignment, remember?

22:24.594 --> 22:26.721
My ass is on the line here, too.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.807
Look, if this checks out,
I'll back you all the way.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.060
But New York is right on this.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.228
You don't have enough
to challenge the White House narrative.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.148
What's the big picture behind your story?
Because I don't see it here yet.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.984
There is a connection
between MacLeish and Lozano.

22:40.109 --> 22:43.654
And this FBI agent, Hannah Wells,
was on to it.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.448
So go find her. Connect the dots.

22:45.573 --> 22:48.659
Get me domestic sources on record,
and I'll get you on the front page.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.704
But until then... dig deeper.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.253
Trucks on the road at night,

22:59.379 --> 23:02.590
that could be transport moving munition
in and out of the silo.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.801
And don't forget the helicopters.

23:06.594 --> 23:07.970
Jason, no credit cards.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.140
They don't talk to locals.
This is it.

23:11.265 --> 23:14.310
- We found a cell.
- Yeah, most likely.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.193
Uh, excuse me.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.486
- Yeah.
- Sorry to bother you.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.531
Uh, we are looking
for a local campground.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.200
- Um...
- Stranger here myself. Sorry.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.160
Oh, shoot. Because the, uh...

23:32.412 --> 23:36.124
the guy at the restaurant said
that if we headed down this road...

23:36.249 --> 23:37.375
I told you. I...

23:37.500 --> 23:38.793
- You're not from here.
- I can't help you.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.336
Okay, thank you for your time.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.712
Oh! Look at this!

23:41.838 --> 23:42.880
- Oh.
- That's all right.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.507
So sorry. Oh, my goodness.

23:44.632 --> 23:47.427
I apologize. Okay.
Have a nice day.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.514
I saw that.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.603
Good job.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.626
Yes, we are that desperate.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.053
What the hell?

24:33.723 --> 24:36.267
Where is this from?

24:46.319 --> 24:47.361
Oh.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.281
Whoa.

24:54.577 --> 24:55.870
Whoa.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.831
Wait a minute.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.253
Whoa.

25:05.588 --> 25:06.881
Huh.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.056
I got you.

25:33.241 --> 25:37.161
I'm sorry, but my meeting
with the Secretary of Energy ran over.

25:37.286 --> 25:41.123
- I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
- There are worse places to wait.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.669
- Does it go away?
- Does what go away?

25:44.794 --> 25:46.546
Being here...

25:47.129 --> 25:49.131
the awe of it all.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.426
No.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.679
Not for me.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.347
When I signed on,

25:56.472 --> 25:59.517
I tried to read every book
about the White House I could.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.769
Did any of them explain
why this office is oval?

26:02.645 --> 26:04.939
Most people think
the architect did it

26:05.064 --> 26:07.108
so that when foreign leaders
came to visit the White House,

26:07.233 --> 26:08.276
they'd be disoriented,

26:08.401 --> 26:10.861
but the truth is
it goes all the way back to Washington.

26:10.987 --> 26:11.988
His house in Philadelphia,

26:12.113 --> 26:14.532
he was the one who wanted
the walls to be built like this.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.450
Once an architect, always an architect.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.994
Got that right.

26:18.119 --> 26:19.495
Mr. President. Julia.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.373
- Emily, come on in.
- Any word from Bowman?

26:22.498 --> 26:24.875
Yes, but unfortunately,
not what we want to hear.

26:25.001 --> 26:28.004
He said no to Clemens.

26:28.129 --> 26:32.008
- Okay, on to plan B.
- Plan B?

26:32.133 --> 26:34.135
Julia, the President and I
were speaking earlier

26:34.260 --> 26:36.387
about a name
we haven't brought up,

26:36.512 --> 26:39.849
a name we think Bowman would be
hard pressed to say no to.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.101
- Who?
- You.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.021
What?

26:48.024 --> 26:49.817
I...

26:49.942 --> 26:52.737
I'm... I'm not a judge. I...

26:52.862 --> 26:55.072
Neither was Earl Warren when
President Eisenhower appointed him,

26:55.197 --> 26:56.699
and he was an outstanding Chief Justice.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.909
Also, you clerked for Justice Gray.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.911
Alex tells me that
some of the opinions you wrote

27:01.037 --> 27:03.247
are mandatory reading
for Constitutional law.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.999
Tom.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.377
I'm flattered.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.630
Julia, I'm not trying to flatter you.

27:13.466 --> 27:16.510
I honestly think
you'd be the best person for the job.

27:17.511 --> 27:21.849
Look, before you say no, just tell me
you'll at least think about it.

27:26.062 --> 27:30.483
There's a series of vehicles
heading to the property with the silo.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.319
Whatever the hell they're doing,

27:33.861 --> 27:36.864
they're definitely doing it out there.
What's with the book?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.533
Well, there's no author
and no copyright.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.619
It's obviously self-published,
but listen to this.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.746
"All democracies, from ancient Athens

27:43.871 --> 27:47.208
to the Roman Republic to the city-states
of the Renaissance, end.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.918
And they end the same way:

27:49.043 --> 27:52.588
as a corrupt alliance of extreme wealth
and centralized power.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.799
Ordinary citizens
are deprived of liberty.

27:54.924 --> 27:56.801
What's rightfully theirs is taken away,

27:56.926 --> 27:59.595
and their children are sent
to die in rich men's wars."

28:01.222 --> 28:02.431
This is a manifesto, Jason.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.975
This is a... a manual
for a new American order.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.477
I mean, look at this.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.771
"Pax Americana;
an American empire

28:08.896 --> 28:11.148
to replace our own
constitutional government."

28:11.273 --> 28:12.400
And check this out.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.321
"No victory without sacrifice."

28:17.446 --> 28:19.615
It repeats over and over in the book.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.743
- NVWS.
- Yeah.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.287
We got to get back to that property.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.626
Come in.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.841
Am I interrupting?

28:36.966 --> 28:39.427
No, no, please.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.477
Tom.

28:48.602 --> 28:49.854
I need to tell you something.

28:49.979 --> 28:50.980
What is it?

28:51.981 --> 28:55.651
I can't be your ninth judge.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.822
Okay, why not?

29:01.824 --> 29:04.994
The fact is
I have early-onset dementia.

29:08.581 --> 29:09.582
What?

29:22.261 --> 29:25.973
I, uh, started noticing symptoms
about a year ago.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.893
Small things; names, dates.

29:29.018 --> 29:31.979
I suddenly couldn't remember.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.356
Oh, my God.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.153
I, uh...

29:42.364 --> 29:44.992
I-I-I don't know what to say.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.623
Do your kids know?

29:52.041 --> 29:53.876
Yes.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.007
I believe in what we're doing, Tom.

30:01.217 --> 30:03.219
I want to see it through.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.347
I have to.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.559
Just can't be with me on the bench.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.359
Of course.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.659
I'm sorry, Julia.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.580
I am so, so sorry.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.757
Silo property's coming up.

30:42.258 --> 30:43.425
SUV coming up.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.846
Looks like we have some company.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.146
Good afternoon.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.273
Hi.

30:58.065 --> 30:59.275
You two lost?

31:00.693 --> 31:01.819
No, I don't think so.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.989
You must have missed the signs, then.
This is private property.

31:05.114 --> 31:08.158
Oh, the map says
that this is public land.

31:08.284 --> 31:10.035
It's not anymore.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.875
What are you guys hunting?

31:18.085 --> 31:21.630
If you circle back, there's a sign
around two miles down the road.

31:23.257 --> 31:25.092
Should lead you back to the highway.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.430
Appreciate it.

31:32.766 --> 31:36.896
Whatever it is they're doing out here,
they're willing to kill for it.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.335
I've got it!

32:00.002 --> 32:03.172
If we can't get through Bowman,
we go around him.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.925
Explain it to me.

33:20.207 --> 33:22.584
We think there are
about 25 to 30 of them.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.795
They also have armed lookouts posted.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.715
<i>The sat survey's
showing 10 to 12 vehicles</i>

33:27.840 --> 33:29.258
<i>parked in a cleared area.</i>

33:29.383 --> 33:31.885
It's almost like
they're waiting for something.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.722
- Those license plates come back?
- Yeah, they're all bogus or stolen.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.056
<i>You're kidding.</i>

33:36.181 --> 33:37.933
And we don't have ears
on any of these people.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.309
We have no idea who they are.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.645
Yeah, they don't seem to be
in anything electronic.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.897
No cellphones, no radio chatter.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.983
No, they're very old-school
when it comes to infrastructure.

33:46.108 --> 33:49.278
Signs and... and countersigns,
very analogue when they want to be.

33:49.403 --> 33:51.488
We're going to have to observe them
up close and personal.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.992
- No unnecessary risks, Hannah.
- Just the necessary ones?

33:55.117 --> 33:58.912
We're putting together a task force
at Grand Forks - FBI and ATF -

33:59.038 --> 34:00.748
but that's still over an hour's flight
from you.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.458
<i>I'll tell you when to send them.</i>

34:02.583 --> 34:04.585
Until then, keep them
the hell away from here.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.465
Please don't get up.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.759
Thank you all for coming back
on such short notice.

34:11.884 --> 34:14.178
I assume you have
another name to put forward.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.513
Actually, we've chosen
not to provide any more names.

34:16.638 --> 34:20.309
But I'll let Professor Rombauer
explain that. It was her idea.

34:20.434 --> 34:21.893
Thank you, Mr. President.

34:23.937 --> 34:27.815
The problem before us
has been finding a ninth judge,

34:27.940 --> 34:30.610
a deciding voice that can preside
over split decisions.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.987
But it's worth noting
that in recent history,

34:33.112 --> 34:37.284
only a quarter of Supreme Court cases
have come down to a single vote.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.745
A far greater number have been unanimous.

34:40.913 --> 34:46.502
So, rather than delay
the wheels of justice any longer

34:46.627 --> 34:49.838
debating the merits
of a potential Chief Justice,

34:49.963 --> 34:55.135
we propose to proceed with the eight
already considered and approved.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.058
I'm sorry, Professor,

35:01.183 --> 35:04.061
but the Constitution sets
the number of judges at nine.

35:04.186 --> 35:08.524
Actually, Senator, the Constitution
does not specify a number.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.150
That's up to Congress.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.737
In fact, when the Supreme Court
first began in 1789,

35:13.862 --> 35:19.076
there were only 6 judges,
then 7, then 9, then 10.

35:19.201 --> 35:22.037
The numbers have fluctuated
over the years.

35:22.162 --> 35:25.582
Intriguing. So, we leave it
to the next president

35:25.707 --> 35:27.417
to pick the Chief Justice?

35:27.543 --> 35:30.170
Not necessarily, but our nation
needs a Supreme Court

35:30.295 --> 35:31.713
up and running as quickly as possible.

35:35.551 --> 35:36.718
Senator?

35:38.220 --> 35:41.306
Okay. I can wait you out, sir.

35:42.057 --> 35:45.519
Mr. President,
looks like you've got a deal.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.855
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, all.

35:51.150 --> 35:53.402
Well done. I'll buy you a beer.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.784
Look, as I said, the President had

36:00.909 --> 36:02.619
an extremely successful meeting
with Congressional leaders

36:02.744 --> 36:05.414
about the Supreme Court, and he'll be
addressing the nation later today.

36:05.539 --> 36:07.583
Okay? That's all I have for now.
Thank you, everybody.

36:09.418 --> 36:12.129
Let's get a better answer
for Gary on the tax-policy question.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.131
Just something we can e-mail him
by the end of the day.

36:14.256 --> 36:16.800
Just pick somebody and have
something in writing we can forward--

36:16.925 --> 36:19.136
- You think you can intimidate me?
- What are you talking about?

36:19.261 --> 36:21.388
Tell your boss to get the FBI to lay off.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.599
Abe, seriously, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:23.724 --> 36:26.810
- Crap. You're having me followed.
- You're delusional.

36:26.935 --> 36:29.813
Yeah, all it means is I'm getting close
to the truth, doesn't it?

36:29.938 --> 36:33.275
- That's what it means.
- Will you excuse us for a second?

36:37.738 --> 36:40.782
Abe, seriously, you should see somebody.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.492
- Aw, come on.
- This is... this is paranoid.

36:42.618 --> 36:44.620
Are you kidding me?
Really? Nice try, Seth.

36:44.745 --> 36:48.040
Great. Just back off.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.922
<i>In what is being called
a master political stroke...</i>

36:55.047 --> 36:56.340
<i>...a shortcut around</i>

36:56.465 --> 36:58.675
<i>the expected party battles
and culture wars.</i>

36:58.800 --> 37:01.595
<i>The Court's most urgent cases
can now be dealt with.</i>

37:01.720 --> 37:03.847
<i>The country
will likely have to wait</i>

37:03.972 --> 37:06.099
<i>until the next election
for a Chief Justice,</i>

37:06.225 --> 37:08.936
<i>but in the meantime,
President Kirkman has fulfilled</i>

37:09.061 --> 37:12.064
<i>his promise to restore
the nation's highest court.</i>

37:18.237 --> 37:20.822
- To you.
- To the Court.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.288
I can't thank you enough.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.750
Mr. President, it was my honor.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.090
Oh, God. Is that really the hour?

37:39.258 --> 37:41.301
I got to get back to New York.

37:41.426 --> 37:45.347
I got a con law class in the morning.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.641
I wonder what we're gonna talk about.

37:49.476 --> 37:50.852
Julia.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.857
Remember me like this.

38:58.545 --> 38:59.463
Yeah?

38:59.588 --> 39:03.091
<i>You're interested in Nestor Lozano.
So are we.</i>

39:03.925 --> 39:06.762
- Who is this?
<i>- A friend.</i>

39:07.179 --> 39:08.805
Yeah, I don't have any friends.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.807
<i>The same friend
who sent you that link</i>

39:10.932 --> 39:13.268
<i>about Hannah Wells
and Speaker Hookstraten.</i>

39:13.393 --> 39:16.104
Okay. You got my attention.

39:16.229 --> 39:19.191
<i>In front of the Roosevelt
Island footbridge, one hour.</i>

39:19.775 --> 39:22.944
- Whoa, hold on, pal. Listen--
<i>- One hour.</i>

39:57.229 --> 39:58.980
I count 35 to 40.

39:59.106 --> 40:00.399
Damn.

40:04.820 --> 40:08.156
Jason, I don't think
these are just bonfires.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.992
I think this is a landing zone.

40:14.788 --> 40:16.706
And I'm picking up a chopper.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.307
Oh, my God.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.017
What?

41:25.692 --> 41:27.486
It's Lozano.
