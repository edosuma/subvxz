00:17.117 --> 00:20.253
Everyone keeps tying me up.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.122
I'm beginning to think
that nobody likes me.

00:23.123 --> 00:23.923
Don't hurt him.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.459
He's not Duncan, Feena.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.061
Not anymore.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.562
Duncan is still in there.

00:29.562 --> 00:30.697
We should help him.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.265
Yeah, Abra.

00:32.265 --> 00:36.202
You should help me.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.641
Knock knock.

00:50.583 --> 00:51.484
Will that door hold?

00:51.484 --> 00:54.320
This place withstood
the invasion.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.722
No one's knocked
it down yet.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.258
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.629
What do we do?

01:03.596 --> 01:05.799
I talk to Silas.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.200
You're not
going out there.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.601
I'll talk to him
through the door.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.003
Why not speak with e

01:10.003 --> 01:14.040
right here, brothe?

01:14.040 --> 01:15.375
Silas?

01:15.375 --> 01:17.610
My Companion cn
speak through Duncan's

01:17.610 --> 01:19.279
and he acts as voice.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.681
One of the many advantages
of being u.

01:24.818 --> 01:25.919
What do you want?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.387
The Sparks.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.122
The weapon, this facility,
your allegiance.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.123
It's a growing list.

01:32.525 --> 01:33.493
Where's Kylie?

01:33.493 --> 01:34.961
Kylie, yes.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.463
We all want something.

01:36.463 --> 01:39.232
Open the doors and
let's discuss it.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.471
You lost Kylie once alread,
Ezra.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.306
It nearly ripped you
and Lynn apart.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.640
No need to lose her again.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.292
You okay?

02:06.292 --> 02:07.293
Fine.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.168
Six months ago today.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.310
I watch the calendar too,
Lynn.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.949
We don't have to talk
about it, but...

02:29.949 --> 02:31.117
I wish we would.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.987
And say what?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.256
How everything's
going to be okay?

02:36.256 --> 02:38.057
How you and I will get
through this together?

02:38.057 --> 02:41.628
How Kylie is happier now?

02:42.629 --> 02:44.797
We said that already.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.366
We both know it isn't true.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.137
Why should we believe you?

02:51.137 --> 02:52.405
That Kylie's alive?

02:52.405 --> 02:53.806
Think, Ezra.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.141
A lethal virus.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.342
Skin Riders.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.444
Do you really think that Lynn
would stay here with Kylie

02:58.444 --> 03:00.580
at the Settlement with
those kinds of threats?

03:00.580 --> 03:02.081
Lynn left the Settlement?

03:02.081 --> 03:04.150
Lots of people di.

03:04.150 --> 03:04.918
Fight or flight.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.920
That's the human way.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.290
And those that flee
live to see another day.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.725
So those graves...

03:12.725 --> 03:15.828
Those aren't the
only settlers.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.964
There are survivors.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.434
Right you are, brother.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.811
Why should we believe
anything he says?

04:04.811 --> 04:06.879
He lied to get in here.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.381
He wasn't lying.

04:08.381 --> 04:11.017
The Skin Rider let
Duncan take control.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.251
So he says.

04:12.251 --> 04:14.921
Yellow showed me who was buried
in some of the graves outside.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.856
I didn't see one
for you or Kylie.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.391
That doesn't
prove anything.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.860
Maybe we were never reborn
or maybe we were in graves

04:20.860 --> 04:21.761
that you didn't see.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.596
Or maybe Duncan was
telling the truth.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.965
I want Kylie to be alive.

04:25.965 --> 04:29.702
I want to believe that,
but that's why I'm wary.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.105
He's playing with
our emotions.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.879
At least they're not
beating the door down anymore.

04:39.879 --> 04:40.880
They'll start up again

04:40.880 --> 04:42.382
as soon as they think
we're not cooperating.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.884
Are we cooperating?

04:44.884 --> 04:46.986
Obviously we're not
letting them in.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.122
And we are not giving
them what they want.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.290
Then we need to focus
on healing Duncan.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.994
If we want answers--

04:54.994 --> 04:57.096
Like if there are survivors
and where they're located--

04:57.096 --> 04:58.097
We need the
real Duncan.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.899
She's right.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.301
He was one of
the settlers.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.137
He was here when the
Settlement divided.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.505
If it divided.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.339
Some died.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.474
Some became Skin Riders,
and some fled.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.077
The only people who can clarify
that are the ones who were here.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.619
Silas nearly became himself
when his parasite fell asleep.

05:19.619 --> 05:23.256
Maybe we find some way to
incapacitate Duncan's.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.590
How?

05:24.590 --> 05:25.591
I'll leave that to Lynn.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.561
I don't know anything
about these parasites.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.163
Then you know
as much as we do.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.764
You're a trauma nurse,

05:31.764 --> 05:33.366
And this is a medical issue.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.934
Yeah, involving
an alien species

05:34.934 --> 05:36.402
with a completely
different biology

05:36.402 --> 05:38.004
and evolutionary history.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.205
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

05:40.039 --> 05:42.575
If it means finding Kylie?

05:42.575 --> 05:44.444
Duncan woud
want you to tr.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.378
And so would I.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.050
Of course.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.456
Feena, will you
stay with her?

05:56.456 --> 05:59.225
Abram and I have to
go deal with them.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.744
You really think
this door will hold?

06:17.744 --> 06:22.115
If it doesn't, our little
barricade here won't do much.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.883
Maybe buy us some tim.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.386
How long can we last in here?

06:31.290 --> 06:35.762
Well, the Sparks can keep making
plants if we feed them organics.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.498
The problem is,
the organics are outside.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.099
Well, we have water
and heat at least.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.640
The forcefield kept us from
exploring all these tunnels.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.243
I say we look for a back door
in case they get through.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.612
The Skin Riders all lived
here in the Settlement.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.447
If there's a back door,
they would know it.

07:05.391 --> 07:09.061
You'll nevr
break that ope.

07:09.061 --> 07:12.565
That door was built to
withstand the Karik.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.734
Jax.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.069
Back from the Ancestor.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.471
And optimistic as always.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.072
What happened to
the forcefield?

07:20.072 --> 07:23.342
Duncan and I took the
initiative in your absence.

07:23.342 --> 07:26.612
I had him infiltrate
their ranks.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.747
He shuts off
the forcefield,

07:27.747 --> 07:29.749
but he doesn't
open the doors?

07:29.749 --> 07:31.684
He met some resistance.

07:31.684 --> 07:35.221
Then I hope he's
finally dead.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.523
If he's captured,
they will extract information.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.760
We've penetrated
their defenses, Jax.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.761
We have the upper hand.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.329
You've penetrated
half of their defenses.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.931
Now you're just locked out
in the cold.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.132
We manage the cold
every day.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.000
Yes, from inside the sh,
out of the elements.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.902
We'll freeze out here
before we break in there.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.772
Are you questioning me?

07:52.772 --> 07:53.940
I'm reminding yo.

07:53.940 --> 07:59.245
The way to beat them is
to strengthen ourselves.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.448
The Ancestor thought
your plan reckless,

08:02.448 --> 08:06.252
but they showed me what thy
knew of the drones nonetheles.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.221
You've reprogrammed it?

08:08.221 --> 08:09.722
I've starte.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.457
But it's a complex system
far more advanced

08:11.457 --> 08:13.392
than when our Ancestors
studied the drones.

08:13.392 --> 08:14.927
Will it work?

08:14.927 --> 08:16.762
Can we block our human's
neural pathways

08:16.762 --> 08:18.130
and give ourselves
greater control?

08:18.130 --> 08:19.398
Possibl.

08:19.398 --> 08:22.535
I won't know for certain
until we have a test subject.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.804
Once we get inside,
we'll have plenty of those.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.005
Come with me.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.683
I used to come here to
get away from everyone.

08:38.683 --> 08:42.688
You mean your human did.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.422
Yes, of course.

08:47.627 --> 08:51.097
You'll work here.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.098
How long will it take?

08:52.098 --> 08:54.000
With the right tools,
I can finish by morning,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.669
but Silas,
our people are half-frozen.

08:56.669 --> 08:57.570
Listen to them.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.437
They're ready to mutiny.

08:58.437 --> 08:59.972
They know that door
is indestructible.

09:00.506 --> 09:01.707
My people obey me.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.542
As long as you show
good judgment, yes,

09:03.542 --> 09:05.044
but they won't
follow a human.

09:05.978 --> 09:06.579
Say again?

09:07.580 --> 09:09.582
Ever since that one named
Ezra was reborn again,

09:09.582 --> 09:11.450
you've been acting...

09:11.450 --> 09:12.485
differently.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.322
Twice you've had him
in your possession.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.324
It would have been easy
to give him a Companion,

09:18.324 --> 09:19.125
and yet...

09:19.125 --> 09:19.859
You didn't.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.395
I don't have to justify
my actions to you.

09:23.596 --> 09:28.234
It wasn't Duncan who let
him go that night, was it?

09:28.234 --> 09:28.935
It was you.

09:32.438 --> 09:37.076
I'll forgive your insolence
this time, Ja.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.678
Never again.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.251
Get to wor.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.499
I want to talk o
Duncan's Companio,

10:00.499 --> 10:02.568
not to Sila.

10:02.568 --> 10:03.536
I'm flattered.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.772
Do you attach yourself
to the human brainstem?

10:06.772 --> 10:09.709
Is that why you're n
the back of the nec?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.380
I know what you're
thinking, Lynn.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.516
If we can just turn off
the parasite,

10:17.516 --> 10:19.885
sweet Duncan will
come back to us.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.255
Maybe I'm asking out
of medical curiosity--

10:23.255 --> 10:25.658
Don't patronize me.

10:25.658 --> 10:28.127
You want to take what's mine.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.866
I'd argue that Duncan
belongs to himself.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.134
If you touch me,

10:35.134 --> 10:40.973
I will inflict pain on him so
severe that he will want to die.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.641
You'd hurt
your own host?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.280
Stay back.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.792
You try that again,

10:59.792 --> 11:02.862
and it'll be so much worse.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.437
If there are survivors,

11:11.437 --> 11:13.939
that answers the question we've
been asking since we got here.

11:13.939 --> 11:16.308
Who buried the dead?

11:16.308 --> 11:17.777
Right.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.379
Yellow said the bodies
were laid with respect.

11:20.379 --> 11:21.947
The Skin Riders
wouldn't do that.

11:21.947 --> 11:28.320
The Settlement lasted
for at least a decade.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.257
They buried
their friends.

11:31.257 --> 11:34.760
There's something else
about the graves.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.595
One of them didn't
have a corpse.

11:36.595 --> 11:37.663
It's empty?

11:37.663 --> 11:38.464
Not empty.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.799
A drone's buried there.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.467
A drone?

11:41.467 --> 11:44.570
Smashed into multiple pieces,
according to Yellow's scans.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.005
If it was here during
the Settlement,

11:46.005 --> 11:48.674
it would have loads
of information.

11:48.674 --> 11:51.444
It might even know where
the survivors went.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.712
See if you can find Yellow.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.415
We need to know everything tt
she knows about that drone.

11:56.415 --> 11:57.216
Ezra.

11:59.151 --> 11:59.885
Ezra.

12:08.194 --> 12:11.330
This parasite might be
worse than we thought.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.298
How so?

12:12.298 --> 12:14.366
It can inflict excrutiating
pain on the host.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.102
They can also
shut off the pain.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.703
They can burn themselves
and not feel it.

12:17.703 --> 12:18.637
The problem is,

12:18.637 --> 12:20.973
there's no single pain center
in the brain.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.843
There's no one place for the
parasite to go to control it.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.612
Pain travels on neural pathways
throughout the body.

12:26.612 --> 12:27.780
What are you saying?

12:27.780 --> 12:30.449
I think this parasite is
bigger than we think.

12:30.449 --> 12:32.585
More than just on the
back of the neck?

12:32.585 --> 12:33.452
When I was infected,

12:33.452 --> 12:34.787
tendrils grew
in every direction,

12:34.787 --> 12:36.956
not just towards my head.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.791
You think it might be
throughout the body?

12:40.459 --> 12:42.795
Possibly.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.930
I've no way of knowing
without doing an MRI.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.067
Once Abram finds Yellow,

12:48.067 --> 12:50.269
she can scan Duncan and
tell us what she sees.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.574
Don't say anything to Feena
until we know for sure.

12:59.011 --> 13:05.417
You all righ?

13:05.417 --> 13:07.586
Do you think it's possible?

13:07.586 --> 13:08.587
That Kylie's alive?

13:09.688 --> 13:11.924
The drones claim to have
her genome and brain state,

13:11.924 --> 13:15.995
so yeah,
I think it's possible.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.797
If people left, Skin Riders
would have hunted them.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.833
Maybe the people got away.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.136
Or maybe not.

13:26.105 --> 13:30.509
He said that Kylie
went with me.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.779
So if there are survivors,

13:33.779 --> 13:37.950
then there's another
version of me out there.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.318
Kylie already has a mother.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.321
She wouldn't need me.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.584
She says they were attacked
at least two hours ago.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.452
Her five-year-old
daughter was taken.

14:13.452 --> 14:14.820
Taken how?

14:14.820 --> 14:15.387
Transport?

14:15.955 --> 14:17.723
On foot.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.091
Heading west.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.160
The shipyar.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.194
How many Karik?

14:22.428 --> 14:24.630
At least ten.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.164
Maybe more.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.067
We'll never catch them
with that kind of lead.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.001
I can run.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.140
These people here
need help.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.342
Lynn and I wil go alone.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.112
Don't make us come
looking for you.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.252
You're goig
to let me com?

14:46.252 --> 14:48.554
I know that look.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.556
And I know better
than to defy it.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.227
This won't bring our
daughter back, Lynn.

14:57.129 --> 15:02.001
No, but we might be able to
help bring back someone else's.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.329
I'm losing my
patience, Ezra!

15:33.098 --> 15:34.433
Any damage?

15:34.433 --> 15:35.868
Not on this side.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.270
But all they need is a crack
to get a wedge in.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.105
We need to stop them from
hitting this thing.

15:40.105 --> 15:44.843
How?

15:44.843 --> 15:48.981
What are you
thinking?

15:48.981 --> 15:50.149
This facility has power.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.455
Yeah, so?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.059
The label's
disintegrated.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.093
They're 400 years old.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.530
Should you be doing that?

16:04.530 --> 16:05.731
You're going to blow a fuse.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.599
It's a miracle any of these
work at all.

16:07.599 --> 16:08.634
I wouldn't press our luck.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.137
That's the one.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.075
You want to fill
us in here?

16:16.075 --> 16:17.409
We need Feena.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.911
If they're goig
to hit that doo,

16:18.911 --> 16:20.245
we're goig
to hit them bac.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.827
That's the best I can do.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.095
Will this work?

16:36.095 --> 16:38.897
Yeah, assuming it
doesn't fry the fuses

16:38.897 --> 16:40.132
or overload the generator

16:40.132 --> 16:43.102
and start a fire that traps us
all in the burning inferno.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.979
You think they would've
given up by now.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.781
They're about to.

17:10.229 --> 17:11.130
Help him!

17:14.566 --> 17:15.733
Bring him inside.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.002
I've got him. I've got him.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.827
It worke?

17:41.827 --> 17:43.429
For the moment.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.430
You found Yellow.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.998
Inside a
charging bay.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.600
At least, that's what
I think it was.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.142
She's not responding.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.178
You didn't say
the magic word.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.147
What did you do to her?

18:02.848 --> 18:08.687
I sang to her a siren song
and put her gently to sleep.

18:08.687 --> 18:09.888
Shall I sing it to you?

18:10.722 --> 18:11.557
Untie him, Abram.

18:13.225 --> 18:16.628
What are you doing?

18:16.628 --> 18:17.830
Moving him.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.399
Everything he hears us say
is being relayed outside.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.868
Oh, busted.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.102
But what if--

18:24.102 --> 18:27.706
What if I promise
not to do it again?

18:33.178 --> 18:36.014
Is there any chance that
I could get a mint on my pillow?

18:38.517 --> 18:41.286
I'm not going to tell you
where your daughter is.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.623
And you're not going to
torture me to find out.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.757
We'll se.

18:47.493 --> 18:50.162
Is there any message
I should give your brother?

18:50.162 --> 18:53.298
Perhaps a menacing threat
of bodily harm

18:53.298 --> 18:56.134
if he doesn't stop
banging on your door?

18:59.638 --> 19:00.405
Tell him this:

19:03.208 --> 19:06.712
I love him,
and I still believe in him.

19:27.065 --> 19:28.800
What about the Obelisk?

19:28.800 --> 19:31.737
Duncan turned it
off somehow.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.339
The forcefield wouldn't
do us much good right now.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.608
It would only trap the Skin
Riders in the courtyard.

19:36.608 --> 19:39.878
The Obelisk might at least
have some answers.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.613
The Obelisk conceals
more than it shares,

19:41.613 --> 19:43.849
as far as I'm concerned.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.752
But if anyone can get it
to talk, it's you.

19:46.752 --> 19:47.653
I'll try.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.493
Any luck?

19:54.493 --> 19:57.329
Duncan must have
incapacitated it somehow.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.932
Otherwise Yellow would
have defended itself.

20:04.603 --> 20:05.170
Yello.

20:06.104 --> 20:06.805
You good?

20:07.172 --> 20:07.906
Feena.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.541
I was put on lockdown.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.375
By Duncan.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.311
I don't
remember.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.112
Checking
brain states.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.181
Duncan was given
drone access codes.

20:16.181 --> 20:17.849
I've changed mine
as a precaution,

20:17.849 --> 20:19.785
considering his
current stat.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.286
What do you mean,
access codes?

20:21.286 --> 20:22.654
And why would Duncan
know them?

20:22.654 --> 20:24.222
I am programmed
not to answer.

20:25.257 --> 20:25.891
Shocker.

20:26.692 --> 20:27.993
I need a full-body
scan of Duncan,

20:27.993 --> 20:30.262
identifying the extent
of the parasite.

20:30.262 --> 20:31.396
Can you do tha?

20:32.130 --> 20:33.498
Where is he?

20:38.470 --> 20:40.806
Oh, I hope you're carolers.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.874
I get no entertainment here.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.150
Show us the parasite,
Yellow.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.395
No.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.666
This can't be right.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.104
I'm sorry, Feena.

21:12.504 --> 21:15.240
But you can help him,
right?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.542
The Sparks,
they can cure him.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.580
It's systemic, Feena.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.315
It encircles vital organs.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.652
Even if there was
a way to remove it...

21:26.652 --> 21:28.654
Duncan wouldn't likely
survive the procedure.

21:48.874 --> 21:49.608
We tried, Lynn.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.381
Their tracks lead
to that warship.

21:56.381 --> 21:59.851
And they're inside it,
beyond our reach.

21:59.851 --> 22:01.753
They hold them for 24 hours
in containment.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.289
She's likely
still alive.

22:04.289 --> 22:05.624
That's not our daughter
in there.

22:05.624 --> 22:06.758
Does that matter?

22:08.260 --> 22:10.228
Of course it matters.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.963
A rescue is suicide.

22:11.963 --> 22:14.766
They would take us out before
we get within a hundred yards.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.101
Then we'll wait 'til dark.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.237
You cannot be serious.

22:19.237 --> 22:20.706
What are we doing
out here, then?

22:20.706 --> 22:22.774
We're surviving.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.177
We help where we can,
where it's feasible.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.446
And we pull back when
there's too much risk.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.881
That's why we're
still alive.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.650
We are not
racing to our deaths

22:31.650 --> 22:33.819
because we can't
handle our grief.

22:33.819 --> 22:34.619
Don't.

22:34.853 --> 22:35.854
Am I wrong?

22:36.321 --> 22:38.790
They took her from us.

22:38.790 --> 22:39.925
Our little girl.

22:42.260 --> 22:42.794
No!

22:45.130 --> 22:48.433
This is not revenge, or--

22:48.433 --> 22:50.502
or some death wish,
or grief.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.139
This is what's rig.

22:54.139 --> 22:56.808
And you don't have to come.

22:56.808 --> 22:59.644
But if you love me,
you will not stop me.

23:14.426 --> 23:15.427
He's dead.

23:23.935 --> 23:27.239
If his Companion grew too
tightly around his heart,

23:27.239 --> 23:28.440
something like this
was inevitable.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.442
Something like this
was avoidable.

23:45.457 --> 23:49.728
Someone should prepare him
for the Ancestor.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.130
At least there he'll
be out of the cold.

24:21.092 --> 24:24.095
I'm guessing by the general
silence and absence of glyphs

24:24.095 --> 24:25.931
that you're not
having much luck.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.099
It won't respond
to anything.

24:28.099 --> 24:31.436
So Duncan can control the
drones and the Obelisk.

24:31.436 --> 24:33.405
If we hadn't stopped him,

24:33.405 --> 24:35.440
there's no telling what
he would have done.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.442
You stopped him.

24:37.442 --> 24:38.777
I tried and failed.

24:39.778 --> 24:41.112
How's Feena?

24:47.919 --> 24:51.523
About as low as
someone can be.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.525
I'd say the chances of
eradicating the parasite

24:53.525 --> 24:59.698
without killing Duncan
are... nil.

24:59.698 --> 25:03.201
That true for
every Skin Rider?

25:03.201 --> 25:09.074
Lynn thinks so.

25:09.074 --> 25:11.877
I'm sorry.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.545
Me too.

25:18.516 --> 25:21.853
I keep asking myself,

25:21.853 --> 25:26.091
where did Duncan
learn to do all this?

25:26.091 --> 25:27.692
If he was one of
the early Reborns,

25:27.692 --> 25:30.762
he had at least ten years
in the Settlement.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.098
That's plenty of time
to learn this tech.

25:33.098 --> 25:33.798
Maybe.

25:36.868 --> 25:40.939
Yellow said Duncan was
"given" drone access codes.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.474
"Given."

25:42.474 --> 25:44.109
That's an event.

25:44.109 --> 25:46.444
One that must have happened
in his original life,

25:46.444 --> 25:48.513
because if it had happened
at the Settlement,

25:48.513 --> 25:50.515
Yellow wouldn't
know about it.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.851
She doesn't have a record
of the Settlement.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.786
If someone gave Duncan
info on the drones,

25:54.786 --> 25:57.322
maybe they gave him info
on the Obelisk too.

25:58.256 --> 26:00.225
The question is, who?

26:03.895 --> 26:07.732
Remember that woman
I told you about?

26:07.732 --> 26:09.134
Eleanor?

26:09.134 --> 26:12.237
The one I saw in deep recall?

26:12.237 --> 26:16.041
She had a drone and Sparks
and a knowledge glyph

26:16.041 --> 26:20.412
on her bracelet,
before the invasion.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.147
She was in the
Settlement too,

26:22.147 --> 26:23.982
which means there were at
least two people here

26:23.982 --> 26:25.884
that knew everything.

26:27.986 --> 26:28.653
You okay?

26:30.088 --> 26:33.625
You didn't say
her name was Eleanor.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.894
What was her last name?

26:35.894 --> 26:38.096
Yellow might have told me,
but I don't remember.

26:50.775 --> 26:51.776
Yellow.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.982
You showed Abram a woman
from the Settlement.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.616
Eleanor?

26:58.616 --> 26:59.617
Show her to me.

26:59.617 --> 27:02.053
I do not conjure holograms
on command, Ezra.

27:02.053 --> 27:02.787
There are rules--

27:02.787 --> 27:04.422
I don't care
about your rules.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.624
Show her to me or you
and I have got problems.

27:07.058 --> 27:08.059
Very well.

27:17.068 --> 27:17.969
Do you know her?

27:19.738 --> 27:21.840
That's what she looked like
when she was younger.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.774
Who is she?

27:23.742 --> 27:25.243
My mother.

27:45.764 --> 27:46.931
What took so long?

27:48.433 --> 27:51.202
I was paying my respects
to the dead, Jax.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.071
Should I have rushed that
for your convenience?

27:58.576 --> 28:00.445
Have someone take him
to the Ancestor.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.781
He won't be the only
casualty if we stay here.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.917
The facility is
within reach.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.119
The warmth we want is in there,
not back at camp.

28:08.119 --> 28:09.387
And what about the doors?

28:09.387 --> 28:11.122
Must I dictate everything?

28:11.122 --> 28:12.524
Have the men cut
don't a tree,

28:12.524 --> 28:13.858
something non-conductive
for a ram.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.959
This isn't difficult.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.895
You think a tree will break
what a missile can't?

28:16.895 --> 28:19.264
I think your lack of faith
is far more problematic

28:19.264 --> 28:20.098
than those doors.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.067
This isn't a matter
of faith, Silas.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.468
We're ill-prepared
for a siege.

28:23.468 --> 28:24.803
THEN PREPARE!

28:42.787 --> 28:45.223
Tell my brother
I love him,

28:45.223 --> 28:48.593
and that I still believe in him.

28:48.593 --> 28:50.595
Let me help you, Silas.

28:50.595 --> 29:00.371
This isn't who you are.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.207
Let me help you, Silas.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.709
This isn't who you are.

29:04.709 --> 29:10.215
Tell my brother I love him,
and that I still believe in him.

29:10.215 --> 29:13.384
Is that yor
mother's grav?

29:15.220 --> 29:17.622
No, my brother's.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.358
Wrong.

29:22.393 --> 29:25.597
Ezra is not your brothe,
Sila.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.231
I am.

29:28.666 --> 29:32.070
Aren't those the words
you spoke to me?

29:32.070 --> 29:36.674
To assure me your human
had little control?

29:36.674 --> 29:38.209
"You are my brother, Ja.

29:38.209 --> 29:42.747
This Ezra, this human,
is nothing but an organism."

29:42.747 --> 29:46.885
And yet, here you ar,
speaking as if..

29:46.885 --> 29:48.253
you were human.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.689
I have given you orders,
Jax.

29:51.689 --> 29:52.924
I suggest you follow them.

29:55.193 --> 29:58.963
What was it?

29:58.963 --> 30:03.635
What emboldened your huma,
Silas?

30:03.635 --> 30:04.936
A brother's love?

30:08.439 --> 30:11.776
You were rigt
about the drone.

30:11.776 --> 30:15.680
Our humans need
to be silenced.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.448
Starting with yours.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.557
There is too much human
in this one, brothers.

30:26.457 --> 30:27.592
This is rebellion!

30:27.592 --> 30:29.394
Yes.

30:29.394 --> 30:31.262
A rebellion of your doing
and not mine.

30:32.864 --> 30:39.671
Your human grows in strengt,
clouds your judgment.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.606
Judgment that
leads to death.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.809
You are removed
from command, Jax.

30:45.476 --> 30:48.813
And who will remove me?

30:48.813 --> 30:51.149
Who of you stands
with our priest?

30:56.154 --> 30:59.324
The drone will silence
your human.

30:59.324 --> 31:02.193
And then we'll see how
fit you are to lead.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.561
Tie him up.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.770
Stay in the courtyard.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.272
Alert me if they
try to leave.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.375
My mother was in
the Settlement,

31:17.375 --> 31:19.110
and you never
thought to tell me?

31:19.110 --> 31:20.211
I just did.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.046
Abram says she knew about
the drones and Sparks

31:22.046 --> 31:23.781
before the invasion.

31:23.781 --> 31:24.849
That true?

31:24.849 --> 31:26.751
Abram is not one to li.

31:26.751 --> 31:29.320
Answer the question!

31:29.320 --> 31:30.855
Abram knows what
you showed him.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.590
Was it true or not?

31:32.590 --> 31:35.893
Your mother was more than
you realize, Ezra.

31:35.893 --> 31:38.062
If not for her,
none of you would be her.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.230
What are you talking about?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.566
Eleanor was partf
an initiative to reinstate

31:41.566 --> 31:45.470
the human race shoud
humans suffer extinctio.

31:45.470 --> 31:46.504
No.

31:46.504 --> 31:47.905
My mother was a humanitarian.

31:47.905 --> 31:49.140
She worked for a non-profit.

31:49.140 --> 31:56.347
What's more humanitarian
than saving humanity?

31:56.347 --> 31:57.615
What initiative?

31:57.615 --> 31:59.851
Further details require
greater clearance.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.754
This was 400 years ago.

32:02.754 --> 32:07.492
I think we're beyond that.

32:07.492 --> 32:08.860
What can you tell me?

32:08.860 --> 32:11.429
This: Duncan isn't lying.

32:11.429 --> 32:16.434
Kylie was here in
the Settlemen.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.603
I thought you had no record
of the Settlement.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.172
I don't;
I only know what I've found.

32:21.172 --> 32:23.841
I scanned the graves and
every hair follicle I found

32:23.841 --> 32:25.043
in the living quarters.

32:25.043 --> 32:28.780
Kylie was her,
but she's not buried outsid.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.014
Well, where is she?

32:30.014 --> 32:34.118
The only person here who can
answer that question is Duncan.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.356
Drones recorded
our brain states.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.024
Can you record Duncan's?

32:40.024 --> 32:41.526
Then you can dip
into his memories

32:41.526 --> 32:43.061
and tell us what he knows.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.462
Not possible.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.331
The parasite is too
deeply imbeddd

32:46.331 --> 32:49.467
to acquire a clen
brain sca.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.035
Lynn?

32:51.035 --> 32:52.970
Anything?

32:52.970 --> 32:56.841
I think we should
try something...

32:56.841 --> 32:59.077
with Feena's permission.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.044
Why me?

33:00.044 --> 33:03.815
Because you'e
closest to Dunca,

33:03.815 --> 33:06.951
and there's a chance that
my idea will kill him.

33:27.605 --> 33:31.676
This is as close as
we're going to get.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.311
We go with camo shields.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.246
Hopefully that'll be enough.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.280
What if they're
watching heat?

33:39.784 --> 33:41.319
I'll go in first.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.788
If I make it, you follow.

33:43.788 --> 33:47.859
Wait.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.927
I have been distant.

33:49.927 --> 33:52.196
I know that.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.332
And I shut you out
and that isn't fair.

33:54.332 --> 33:54.932
Lynn, it's--

33:54.932 --> 33:56.067
No, no.

33:56.067 --> 33:57.135
Hear me out.

33:57.135 --> 34:01.005
You want to talk,
I'm talking.

34:01.439 --> 34:04.242
It's just...

34:04.242 --> 34:10.481
I look at you,
and I see her.

34:10.481 --> 34:11.681
And I see--

34:11.681 --> 34:15.286
I see us with her.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.422
And that hurts too much.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.424
And I don't want
to hurt anymore.

34:21.525 --> 34:26.330
But I would rather hurt
than lose you too.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.571
That hurt won't
go away, Lynn.

34:33.571 --> 34:41.545
Neither will I.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.631
I made it.

35:00.631 --> 35:01.666
Field is clear.

35:01.666 --> 35:02.400
Copy that.

35:02.400 --> 35:12.443
On my way.

35:12.443 --> 35:24.822
On my way.

35:24.822 --> 35:27.892
Remember, two to the head--

35:27.892 --> 35:29.627
Leaves Karik dead.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.761
Right.

35:30.761 --> 35:32.930
Stay close.

35:42.373 --> 35:45.443
Hello, ladies.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.711
Did you miss me?

35:46.711 --> 35:48.980
Take off your jacket.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.482
Well, then.

35:51.482 --> 35:55.353
I mean, that is a bit
forward of you,

35:55.353 --> 35:58.990
but, uh, I'm curious to
see where this goes.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.992
Yellow.

36:06.797 --> 36:15.873
You think a tranquilizer
dart can take me down?

36:18.543 --> 36:22.046
Yellow, show me vitals.

36:22.046 --> 36:23.247
Blood pressure dropping,
heart rate slowing.

36:23.247 --> 36:23.948
Is that normal?

36:30.421 --> 36:31.088
Injecting Spar.

36:34.091 --> 36:35.493
Yellow, you sure abt
that tranq dose?

36:35.493 --> 36:36.394
Affirmative.

36:36.394 --> 36:37.428
Likely non-lethal levels.

36:37.428 --> 36:38.896
Likely?!

36:38.896 --> 36:41.198
The parasite disrupts
his normal biochemistry.

36:41.198 --> 36:42.867
I must make certain
assumptions.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.101
Watch his breathing.

36:44.101 --> 36:45.403
This isn't going to wo.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.004
The Sparks will
stimulate neurons

36:47.004 --> 36:49.106
that will wake the human Duncan.

36:49.106 --> 36:50.508
How long is that
going to take?

36:54.779 --> 36:55.513
Duncan.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.085
Hey.

37:02.920 --> 37:03.588
You all right?

37:04.255 --> 37:05.590
I am now.

37:06.190 --> 37:10.127
You look great.

37:10.127 --> 37:13.731
I'm, uh, guessing
I could use a bath.

37:14.565 --> 37:15.199
It wouldn't hurt.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.403
Feena.

37:19.403 --> 37:20.471
I can't move.

37:20.471 --> 37:22.073
We sedated the parasite.

37:22.073 --> 37:22.406
Good.

37:22.406 --> 37:22.873
Kill it.

37:23.674 --> 37:24.809
Doing so might
kill you as well.

37:25.610 --> 37:26.344
I know.

37:26.344 --> 37:26.944
It's okay.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.079
No, it isn't.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.581
We'll find a wa.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.683
There isn't a way, Feena.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.685
And even if there was,
he wouldn't let it happen.

37:34.685 --> 37:35.620
He'd kill me first.

37:35.620 --> 37:36.420
No.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.756
We don't have much time.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.425
You need information?

37:41.425 --> 37:43.160
The survivors.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.495
Are they still alive?

37:44.495 --> 37:47.031
I'll tell you
what I know.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.200
Yellow, project a map.

37:55.506 --> 37:57.008
We need to move quickly.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.976
I can feel him waking up.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.685
That's all you know?

38:07.685 --> 38:08.519
That's the meeting place

38:08.519 --> 38:10.588
for the people that
headed north.

38:10.588 --> 38:12.390
Where they went from there,
I can't tell you.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.058
So we still don't
have a location.

38:14.058 --> 38:15.726
At least we know
Kylie got away.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.395
They left nearly
two years ago.

38:17.395 --> 38:19.430
What if they've been pushing
north that whole time?

38:19.430 --> 38:20.598
We'll never find the.

38:20.598 --> 38:22.266
There may be someone
who can help you.

38:22.266 --> 38:23.668
There's a girl,

38:23.668 --> 38:25.336
a young girl in the forest,

38:25.336 --> 38:26.937
if you can find her, Raven.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.406
The girl who helped me?

38:28.406 --> 38:30.341
She may know where
the survivors are.

38:30.341 --> 38:32.510
She hunts here
and watches us,

38:32.510 --> 38:36.447
but she lives in the north.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.549
It's waking.

38:38.549 --> 38:39.784
We have to do something.

38:40.451 --> 38:49.427
There's nothing
to be done...

38:49.427 --> 38:50.428
Human.

38:58.102 --> 39:02.640
Oh, you are all so clever.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.175
But I told you--

39:04.175 --> 39:06.877
I told you that
if you get close,

39:06.877 --> 39:09.213
I will hurt Duncan.

39:09.213 --> 39:10.614
You stlll have Sparks
inside yo.

39:10.614 --> 39:12.850
We've given them very
specific instructions.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.952
If you hurt Duncan,
there will be consequences.

39:14.952 --> 39:17.354
The body naturally
discards Sparks.

39:17.354 --> 39:20.858
All I have to do is wait!

39:26.063 --> 39:27.765
Hey.

39:27.765 --> 39:32.670
What, you're not even going
to put down some newspaper?

39:39.076 --> 39:40.811
We can't keep him
locked up indefinitely.

39:40.811 --> 39:43.214
He'll keep
hurting Duncan.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.016
As much as I hate
to say this,

39:46.016 --> 39:51.088
I think we should... consider
what Duncan wants us to do.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.022
I can't.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.059
Then our only hope
is the Ancestor.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.996
Which we can't destroy
without the weapon.

39:58.996 --> 40:01.499
And we're not sedating Duncan
again to ask where he hid it.

40:01.499 --> 40:03.501
That won't be necessary.

40:28.692 --> 40:29.360
Here.

40:37.601 --> 40:38.536
It's locked.

40:38.536 --> 40:40.004
I'll go get the
sledgehammer.

40:40.004 --> 40:41.472
See if we can't
break it open.

40:45.409 --> 40:47.578
Or you could
unlock it.

40:57.988 --> 40:59.690
What now?

40:59.690 --> 41:00.991
We're not going
after the Ancestor

41:00.991 --> 41:02.760
until Lynn and
I go after Kylie.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.629
What about the small army
of Skin Riders outside?

41:05.629 --> 41:07.431
It's been awfully quiet.

41:07.431 --> 41:08.866
We sure they're
still out there?

41:28.152 --> 41:31.589
If we don't make it back,
destroy the Ancestor.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.858
You'll be back.

41:33.858 --> 41:35.926
It's nice having another
woman around.

41:35.926 --> 41:38.195
Don't stay away too long.

41:38.195 --> 41:40.464
You're stronger than
you think, Feena.

41:40.464 --> 41:42.266
Thanks for helping us.

43:04.081 --> 43:07.084
We're going to take you to
your mommy, okay?

43:08.752 --> 43:09.420
What's happening?

43:10.487 --> 43:11.722
We're taking off.

43:13.557 --> 43:14.625
Take the girl!

43:41.251 --> 43:42.920
Behind you.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.456
I see hi.

44:26.764 --> 44:28.432
These restraints are
unneccessary, Jax.

44:28.432 --> 44:31.568
The drone
was my idea.

44:31.568 --> 44:33.337
If it makes my
Companion stronger,

44:33.337 --> 44:36.874
I'll gladly do it.

44:59.163 --> 45:02.733
For your sak,
this better wo.

45:10.674 --> 45:12.009
Hello, Silas.

45:12.009 --> 45:14.545
I will sever the human's
influence in your mind

45:14.545 --> 45:17.081
without damaging
normal brain function.

45:17.081 --> 45:22.086
Get on with it.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.109
Two Reborns have been
spotted in the woods.

45:45.109 --> 45:46.610
Send two brothers
to find them.

45:46.610 --> 45:49.113
Follow, don't kill.

45:49.113 --> 45:50.781
I want continual
reports.

46:04.561 --> 46:05.996
She's not here.

46:10.734 --> 46:12.336
How old did you say
this girl was?

46:12.736 --> 46:13.904
Maybe ten?

46:14.538 --> 46:17.074
She probably wised up
and took off.

46:17.074 --> 46:18.342
We should do the same.

46:18.342 --> 46:20.911
How are we going to find
these people without a guide?

46:20.911 --> 46:23.714
Follow Duncan's directions
and see where they lead us.

46:23.714 --> 46:24.915
Where they lead us
is nowhere.

46:24.915 --> 46:26.316
If the Skin Riders
couldn't find them,

46:26.316 --> 46:27.284
how will we?

46:27.284 --> 46:29.753
We'll do what the
Skin Riders didn't:

46:29.753 --> 46:31.555
We'll keep looking.

46:37.761 --> 46:41.098
What light through yon
window breaks?

46:41.098 --> 46:45.169
'Tis Feena, my sun,
and I am her moon.

46:45.169 --> 46:46.203
You're quoting it wrong.

46:48.305 --> 46:53.110
Well, it's Duncan's memory,
so I blame hi.

46:55.245 --> 46:59.416
Also, you cant
feed me this so.

46:59.416 --> 47:00.250
All right?

47:00.250 --> 47:01.785
It's cruel and
unusual punishment.

47:01.785 --> 47:02.986
You'd rather starve?

47:02.986 --> 47:05.122
I might enjoy that more,
yeah.

47:05.122 --> 47:06.623
Well, it's your
last meal anyway.

47:07.724 --> 47:10.627
Well, that sounds grave.

47:10.627 --> 47:12.729
What are you going to do?

47:12.729 --> 47:14.731
Poke me with your stick?

47:14.731 --> 47:17.134
Duncan made me promise that
if I ever got the chance,

47:17.134 --> 47:18.135
I would kill you.

47:19.036 --> 47:23.640
To end your suffering
and his enslavement to you.

47:23.640 --> 47:28.745
Well, that is
morbidly sentimental,

47:28.745 --> 47:32.716
but I think we both know that
you don't have it in you.

47:32.716 --> 47:35.752
I mea,
you can't kill Dunc.

47:35.752 --> 47:37.854
That's what I thought.

47:37.854 --> 47:39.890
And then I realized
you already have.

47:40.757 --> 47:43.227
There is no
Duncan anymore.

47:43.227 --> 47:44.928
There's only his
brain state, really.

47:44.928 --> 47:46.530
And I have that anyway.

47:49.766 --> 47:54.838
Now let's--
Let's hold on a minute.

47:56.373 --> 48:03.113
Get out. Move!

48:03.113 --> 48:05.716
You said you would inflit
pain on Dunc.

48:05.716 --> 48:08.051
If we kept you here,
you'd make his life miserable.

48:08.051 --> 48:09.620
And I can't let you do that.

48:10.387 --> 48:15.459
I, um, I may have been speaking
a little dramatically.

48:15.459 --> 48:16.526
You know, for effect.

48:16.526 --> 48:17.728
I love Duncan.

48:17.728 --> 48:18.895
And when you love someone,

48:18.895 --> 48:20.664
you're willing to do difficult
things to protect them.

48:20.664 --> 48:21.565
I know that now.

48:21.565 --> 48:22.866
You think about what
you're doing here.

48:22.866 --> 48:24.067
Oh, I have.

48:24.067 --> 48:25.402
You took my husban.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.437
The father of my child.

48:27.437 --> 48:29.339
He was everything to me,
and you stole him.

48:29.339 --> 48:32.743
I won't hurt Duncan, okay?

48:32.743 --> 48:33.543
Give you my word.

48:33.543 --> 48:35.178
What is the word
of a Skin Rider?

48:35.178 --> 48:36.213
All right, wait!

48:36.213 --> 48:38.415
Wait, I know things, okay?

48:38.415 --> 48:40.350
I know things about
the Settlement

48:40.350 --> 48:41.785
and I know things
about the Obelisk.

48:41.785 --> 48:47.090
Tell me where
the Ancestor is.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.091
I'll die first.

48:48.091 --> 48:49.926
I thought you'd say that.

48:49.926 --> 48:53.730
Yellow.

49:21.058 --> 49:23.694
I knew you didn't have it
in you, woman.

49:40.410 --> 49:42.079
He's gone.

49:47.117 --> 49:49.553
You think he knows about
the tracking device?

49:49.553 --> 49:50.287
No.

49:50.287 --> 49:54.091
Yellow buried it deep.

49:54.091 --> 49:56.426
What if he doesn't
go to the Ancestor?

49:56.426 --> 49:57.027
He will.

49:57.627 --> 49:58.762
And when he does,

49:58.762 --> 49:59.930
we'll know where it is.

50:03.767 --> 50:06.103
It was smart thinking,
Feena.

50:06.103 --> 50:07.237
You did good.

50:07.938 --> 50:09.339
No, I didn't.

50:09.339 --> 50:11.641
I broke a promise
to the man I love.

50:11.641 --> 50:13.443
There's no good in that.

50:44.274 --> 50:46.343
Stace.

50:46.343 --> 50:48.145
Mommy!

50:56.420 --> 50:57.821
Thank you.

51:16.907 --> 51:17.574
Lynn.

51:21.445 --> 51:22.579
Come out of there!

51:24.781 --> 51:26.650
Wait, don't!
That's her.

51:31.121 --> 51:33.690
This is my husband, Ezra.

51:36.726 --> 51:37.861
Nice to meet you.

51:40.864 --> 51:44.301
Someone told us your name...
Raven.

51:48.138 --> 51:50.340
We need your help, Raven.

51:50.340 --> 51:53.543
We're trying to find our
daugher, Kylie.

51:53.543 --> 51:54.578
She was with me.

51:54.578 --> 51:55.445
Do you know her?

51:57.280 --> 51:59.483
She doesn't
understand.

51:59.483 --> 52:01.284
No.

52:01.284 --> 52:04.221
She helped me and was kind
to me because she knew me.

52:04.221 --> 52:06.756
The previous me.

52:06.756 --> 52:08.391
Can you take us to Kylie?

52:09.759 --> 52:10.961
My daughter?

52:10.961 --> 52:12.762
Our daughter?

52:16.600 --> 52:18.101
Do we follow her?

52:18.101 --> 52:21.037
Wherever she's leading us,
it will help.

52:25.575 --> 52:26.643
You escaped?

52:27.444 --> 52:28.345
They let me go.

52:29.446 --> 52:32.115
It's because of love, J.

52:32.115 --> 52:42.125
Every human's weakness.

52:48.932 --> 52:50.267
What have you done to me?

52:50.267 --> 52:53.370
Jax foolishly believed that
a drone could be reprogrammed

52:53.370 --> 52:55.238
to perform unauthorized
functions.

52:55.472 --> 52:57.974
You did the opposite?

52:57.974 --> 52:59.809
You cut off the parasite's
neural pathways?

52:59.809 --> 53:01.478
The connections
are still there.

53:01.478 --> 53:06.616
The information simply
can't be transferred.

53:06.616 --> 53:09.986
You freed me of the parasite.

53:09.986 --> 53:11.354
But it will alert the others.

53:11.354 --> 53:13.857
The parasite can only transmit
an injury response,

53:13.857 --> 53:15.191
which, after an operation,

53:15.191 --> 53:17.494
is what the Skin Riders
will expect to hear.

53:17.494 --> 53:18.295
So I'm cured?

53:18.295 --> 53:19.062
Hardly.

53:19.062 --> 53:20.463
You have control
of yourself, yes,

53:20.463 --> 53:22.999
but only for the moment.

53:22.999 --> 53:24.968
The parasite will
regain control?

53:24.968 --> 53:28.371
It will try by accelerating
growth and extending its reach--

53:28.371 --> 53:31.174
A move that your body
will aggressively attack.

53:31.174 --> 53:32.275
That sounds painful.

53:32.275 --> 53:33.176
And fatal.

53:33.176 --> 53:34.911
I give you 48 hours.

53:34.911 --> 53:36.580
It's what you wanted, Silas.

53:36.580 --> 53:37.981
I saw it in your mind.

53:37.981 --> 53:39.182
Am I wrong?

53:39.182 --> 53:43.520
No, thank you.

53:43.520 --> 53:45.355
I can't exactly waltz
out of here, though.

53:45.355 --> 53:46.289
I will help you.

53:48.425 --> 53:50.827
I'll take it.

54:01.805 --> 54:02.539
Wait!

54:02.839 --> 54:03.740
What did she see?

54:06.610 --> 54:07.978
We're being followed.

54:07.978 --> 54:08.645
Run!

54:41.177 --> 54:43.546
Drop your bow,
or we drop you.
