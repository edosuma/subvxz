WEBVTT

00:05.501 --> 00:07.909
Carla, might l have a word?

00:09.131 --> 00:12.833
l know how you always like
to poke fun at me and whatnot,

00:13.011 --> 00:18.256
but l'd appreciate it if you stayed away
from one area l'm sensitive about.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.806
- That is my ears.
- l don't make jokes about your ears.

00:21.982 --> 00:27.108
Why would l make jokes about...
Oh, my God!

00:28.199 --> 00:32.529
l never noticed
those satellite dishes before.

00:32.705 --> 00:36.954
l must have been distracted by the other
atrocities attached to your head.

00:37.128 --> 00:39.750
Just hear me out on this one, will you?

00:39.923 --> 00:42.676
Last night
l went through my insurance policy

00:42.843 --> 00:46.095
and l discovered that l'm eligible
for an ear tuck.

00:46.265 --> 00:50.264
lt's going to be hard enough to go
through without you razzing me.

00:50.438 --> 00:54.602
So all l want to ask is that you
please not make my life a living hell.

00:54.776 --> 00:59.404
- This really means a lot to you.
- lt's the most important thing in my life.

00:59.574 --> 01:02.826
Well, go ahead. Get it done. We'll see.

01:03.914 --> 01:07.995
One other thing, Carla. Would you
lay off about how l live with my mother?

01:08.169 --> 01:12.335
Gee, you've got to give me something.
What am l going to tease you about?

01:12.509 --> 01:15.131
l'm not the most tidy guy in the world.

01:15.305 --> 01:17.927
Oh, OK. l'll limit myself to that.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.517
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome. Your mother called.

01:21.688 --> 01:25.770
She said you left your earmuffs
in the driveway and no one can get out.

01:28.364 --> 01:30.606
That was a tidy tease.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

02:46.511 --> 02:48.636
Hey, everybody.

02:49.724 --> 02:53.225
- What do you have there, Sam?
- Looks like books.

02:53.396 --> 02:57.893
Yeah, l guess you could call them books.
Something l've been meaning to read.

02:58.069 --> 03:03.907
Why don't you open one up so we can
see the little gingerbread house pop out?

03:04.995 --> 03:08.447
You wasted your money on that one,
Sam.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.413
You'll be disappointed with the ending.

03:12.255 --> 03:14.295
l'll be in my office.

03:16.343 --> 03:21.257
- He locked his door.
- We're trapped out here with you.

03:22.685 --> 03:24.809
Sam never locks his door.

03:24.980 --> 03:27.816
He's done that a few times this week.

03:27.984 --> 03:31.900
He did it the other night, never made
a sound. Stayed till closing time.

03:32.074 --> 03:35.989
My God.
The thing l feared worst has happened.

03:36.162 --> 03:39.413
Your living bra died of boredom.

03:42.838 --> 03:45.544
This is no time for levity.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.806
l think Sam might be drinking again.
l was afraid of this.

03:52.100 --> 03:56.563
Day after day of watching
Frasier and me exulting in our joy

03:56.732 --> 03:59.188
has driven him over the edge.

03:59.361 --> 04:02.446
Come on, Diane.
l doubt seriously if he's drinking.

04:02.615 --> 04:05.024
There's lots of things he could be doing.

04:05.202 --> 04:07.444
Like what?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.781
Maybe he's reading just like he said.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.659
lt can't be that. l was once with Sam
when he was reading.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.247
l'd recognise the sounds anywhere.

04:18.678 --> 04:22.178
Well, there's one way
to ascertain whether he's drinking.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.260
l will smell his breath.

04:28.274 --> 04:30.897
- Go away.
- Sam, it's Diane.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.776
Go far away.

04:33.949 --> 04:37.533
Sam, there's something important
l need to talk to you about.

04:37.704 --> 04:41.572
- All right, come in.
- The door is locked.

04:41.751 --> 04:44.077
l wonder how that happened.

04:45.381 --> 04:47.790
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello.

04:47.968 --> 04:51.219
What are you doing?
Why are you sniffing like that?

04:52.557 --> 04:56.557
- What's that?
- l told you, l had a book.

04:58.106 --> 05:01.559
''The World And lts People.''
This is surprising, Sam.

05:01.737 --> 05:07.029
The title doesn't contain the words
naughty, hot, or throbbing?

05:10.874 --> 05:16.500
- l told you, it's just a book l'm reading.
- lt's not just a book. lt's a textbook.

05:16.673 --> 05:21.468
- Are you back in school?
- Promise you won't tell anybody.

05:21.639 --> 05:26.682
This is nothing to keep secret. This is
wonderful. Why are you concealing it?

05:26.854 --> 05:30.556
lt's a little embarrassing.
A guy my age going back to school.

05:30.734 --> 05:36.490
lt's not embarrassing! lt's noble and fine
and it's inspirational. Let's tell everyone!

05:36.659 --> 05:40.160
No, come on.
You know how the guys make fun of me.

05:40.331 --> 05:46.169
Sam, no one enjoys teasing you
more than l do and l refrained.

05:47.215 --> 05:50.336
That's true.
All right, what the hey, let's do it.

05:50.511 --> 05:53.050
- l'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

05:53.223 --> 05:56.593
- Unless...
- Unless what?

05:58.689 --> 06:05.655
Sam, you're not doing this to impress me
and win me back, are you?

06:07.952 --> 06:11.784
- No, l'm doing it for my diploma.
- l hope so.

06:11.957 --> 06:16.585
lf this is part of some involved scheme
to get me back in bed with you,

06:16.756 --> 06:18.963
you will be very disappointed.

06:19.134 --> 06:21.804
Yeah, but you'll enjoy yourself.

06:26.936 --> 06:30.271
Attention, everyone.
l have an announcement to make.

06:30.441 --> 06:36.196
Someone in Cheers is improving himself
and l want you all to know about it.

06:36.365 --> 06:41.243
l knew it. Carla, you told Diane
about my ear job, didn't you?

06:42.790 --> 06:47.038
Clifford, Carla didn't tell me anything.

06:47.213 --> 06:49.669
Well, you were saying?

06:52.304 --> 06:54.427
After a rather lengthy interruption,

06:54.598 --> 06:59.226
Sam has decided to go back to school
and pursue his degree.

07:05.446 --> 07:09.575
- You're getting your ears done, man?
- Where's your sense of humour.

07:09.743 --> 07:13.161
- lt was a joke.
- Will you forget about that?

07:13.332 --> 07:18.328
This is exciting news. Our Sammy is
going to attain his Bachelor of what?

07:18.506 --> 07:20.914
- Art? Sciences?
- High school.

07:21.092 --> 07:26.052
- His Bachelor... High school. What?
- l never graduated from high school.

07:27.727 --> 07:31.511
ln my senior year l got a contract
to play Class A ball.

07:31.690 --> 07:36.852
Spring training didn't start until February
and school didn't get out until June.

07:38.909 --> 07:41.317
High school.

07:41.496 --> 07:44.912
l always promised my parents
l'd go back and finish.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.453
She was a lot happier
about this in the other room.

07:49.840 --> 07:55.216
l spent a year of my life
being defiled by Dobie Gillis.

07:57.768 --> 08:03.108
l'm terribly sorry.
l just assumed you meant college.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.395
- l plan to go to college, too.
- Good.

08:06.570 --> 08:11.650
Let me know when you get there so
l can leave the house without a veil.

08:12.829 --> 08:17.457
Sam, why does a guy like you
want to go back to high school?

08:17.627 --> 08:20.083
You got everything a man could want

08:20.256 --> 08:23.958
and you dumped
the one thing no man wants.

08:24.846 --> 08:28.097
l'm tired of being embarrassed
about being a dropout.

08:28.266 --> 08:32.100
lt's nothing to be ashamed of.
A lot of famous people never graduated.

08:32.272 --> 08:33.850
Name three.

08:34.024 --> 08:36.149
According to ''The Book Of Lists'',

08:36.320 --> 08:41.280
Thomas Edison, NoÃ«l Coward.
Cher never graduated.

08:42.785 --> 08:46.572
- Cher?
- Absolutely. Never finished, Coach.

08:46.751 --> 08:50.999
- l feel a lot better now.
- Why? You never finished either?

08:51.173 --> 08:55.801
No, l was missing a couple
of those what-d'-you-ma-call-its?

08:55.971 --> 08:59.222
- Units?
- No, years, Diane.

08:59.392 --> 09:04.020
Do you think it would be a good idea
if l was going back to school?

09:04.190 --> 09:06.315
l think it's a wonderful idea.

09:06.486 --> 09:09.025
The two of you can go together.

09:09.198 --> 09:12.199
Coach can make up classes he missed.
What do you think?

09:12.368 --> 09:15.536
l'll have my hands full
getting me through.

09:15.706 --> 09:18.661
lt'll be fun.
You'll have someone to study with.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.747
Coach, l'm just taking geography.

09:21.923 --> 09:25.424
lt's the last thing l have to complete
so l can get my diploma.

09:25.595 --> 09:29.047
Sam, it would only be
a start for me, you know.

09:29.224 --> 09:33.306
As a matter of fact, as l remember it now
l was very good in geography.

09:33.481 --> 09:35.723
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:35.901 --> 09:38.309
Or was it geometry?

09:38.487 --> 09:41.062
Diane, give me a question in geometry.

09:41.241 --> 09:45.869
What is the sum of the angles
in an isosceles triangle?

09:46.039 --> 09:48.079
lt was geography.

09:55.385 --> 09:57.425
- Hey, everybody.
- Clifford.

09:57.597 --> 10:03.851
Diane. Well, take your last look
at a flawed Clifford.

10:04.981 --> 10:07.058
Tomorrow l go under the knife.

10:07.234 --> 10:09.987
Why don't you just go under the bus?

10:11.115 --> 10:15.695
l'm talking about my operation, Carla.
l'm going to have my ears tucked back.

10:15.871 --> 10:18.707
Save money
Put chewing gum behind them.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.915
That doesn't work.

10:21.086 --> 10:23.757
l mean that probably wouldn't work.

10:33.980 --> 10:38.275
- Don't let me stop you. You're on a roll.
- Those are the only words l know.

10:38.444 --> 10:40.982
You guys seem to be in a good mood.

10:41.156 --> 10:45.866
You noticed?
We did great on our test tonight.

10:46.037 --> 10:48.445
You both passed?

10:48.624 --> 10:52.208
Passed? We both got A's again.

10:52.379 --> 10:55.832
Once again we got
the two highest grades in the class.

10:59.639 --> 11:03.140
Are we going
to study together tonight?

11:03.311 --> 11:06.646
Listen, this exam's going to constitute
80% of our grades.

11:06.816 --> 11:11.396
- What have l told you all semester?
- Oh, l know, l know.

11:11.572 --> 11:13.612
Studying is for saps.

11:13.783 --> 11:16.191
That's right. l'll be in my office.

11:16.370 --> 11:19.621
- What was the test about, Sam?
- l don't know. l forget.

11:19.791 --> 11:25.132
Wait a minute. You got an A on this test
and you don't know what it covered?

11:25.299 --> 11:27.791
After a quiz, l like to empty out my head.

11:27.969 --> 11:30.508
How? By blowing your nose?

11:30.681 --> 11:32.888
l got an A, didn't l?

11:35.521 --> 11:38.309
Coach, l am so impressed with you.

11:38.483 --> 11:40.523
Thank you, Diane.

11:40.694 --> 11:45.240
- Sam didn't retain much from the test.
- Yeah, but he does just great.

11:45.409 --> 11:49.456
l never realised what a brain he is.
l study all the time.

11:49.624 --> 11:52.745
He sleeps in the classroom.
He never takes a note.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.960
And still he gets the great grades.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.833
No wonder he's Miss Purdy's favourite.

12:02.975 --> 12:07.389
- Miss Purdy?
- Yeah, our beautiful school teacher.

12:08.441 --> 12:10.481
And Sam is her favourite?

12:10.652 --> 12:16.028
Well, l can't say that. But Sam's
the only one l ever saw her kiss.

12:19.497 --> 12:23.876
- They kiss?
- Yeah, l saw them in the parking lot.

12:24.045 --> 12:27.996
l was putting up a notice there
on the bulletin board.

12:29.218 --> 12:31.924
With probing tongues?

12:34.809 --> 12:38.061
No, Diane,
with a thumbtack and my thumb.

12:43.237 --> 12:49.112
l can't believe he's sunk to these depths.
l curse the day l walked into this bar.

12:49.288 --> 12:51.411
Then it's unanimous.

13:00.845 --> 13:03.966
Sam Malone, this is absolutely...

13:04.142 --> 13:08.390
- The worst thing l've ever done.
- The worst thing... Wait a minute.

13:08.564 --> 13:12.350
You don't know what l'm going to say.
l found out you have been...

13:12.528 --> 13:15.316
- Sleeping with my teacher.
- That's right.

13:15.490 --> 13:18.657
That's not the worst part.
She also has been giving you...

13:18.827 --> 13:22.958
- Good marks because of it.
- Yes.

13:24.418 --> 13:27.421
Are you admitting
that you know it's wrong?

13:27.590 --> 13:33.630
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah? Well, stop slouching.

13:34.725 --> 13:37.014
Look what's happened to your posture.

13:37.186 --> 13:39.429
- What?
- l needed something.

13:40.899 --> 13:44.483
Gee...the whole thing
started so innocently.

13:44.655 --> 13:49.651
l began dating her because she was
cute and because we hit it off.

13:49.828 --> 13:53.365
l had no idea that l was going to get
better marks because of it.

13:53.542 --> 13:58.918
l just was after some meaningless sex
and it's turned into something sleazy.

14:00.801 --> 14:04.753
You know the old saying,
''The best laid plans of mice and scum...''

14:05.933 --> 14:08.425
Yeah, boy, ain't that the truth?

14:08.604 --> 14:12.520
l didn't realise anything was wrong
until l got these quizzes back.

14:12.693 --> 14:17.487
lnstead of marking off wrong answers,
she'd say, ''Close enough. A plus.''

14:21.372 --> 14:24.242
lt's a sad commentary
on our educational system

14:24.416 --> 14:27.454
when a harlot
is allowed in the public schools.

14:27.629 --> 14:33.005
lf l remember correctly, when we met
you were dating your professor.

14:33.179 --> 14:37.889
For your information, l was a legitimate
A student in the classroom.

14:38.060 --> 14:40.268
l never got good grades in the sack.

14:40.439 --> 14:43.808
Don't worry.
l always gave you an E for effort.

14:46.279 --> 14:48.523
l'm going to tell you what you have to do.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.824
You won't like it, but you have to...

14:50.995 --> 14:54.364
Call Miss Purdy
and tell her l want an honest grade.

14:54.541 --> 14:57.163
Sit up straight!

14:57.336 --> 15:02.677
l can't do that, Diane.
l'm not prepared to take the exam.

15:02.844 --> 15:05.418
Well, Coach will help you.

15:05.597 --> 15:10.676
Sam, you started out
with such noble intentions.

15:10.854 --> 15:13.014
l hate to see you end up like this.

15:13.192 --> 15:18.947
Yeah, l know you're right. Right after
l take the exam, then l'll call her.

15:21.619 --> 15:23.660
Come on...

15:26.376 --> 15:29.628
Maybe with Coach's help, l can get by.

15:36.473 --> 15:41.101
Hello, Miss Purdy? lt's little
Sammy Malone from the third row.

15:43.274 --> 15:50.358
Yeah, listen, Alana, about school,
l had this crazy thought.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.942
l'm even embarrassed to mention it.

15:53.121 --> 15:58.117
ls our relationship in any way
affecting the marks l've been getting?

15:58.294 --> 16:01.996
Like making you
unconsciously change some of...

16:02.175 --> 16:05.794
What? You are?

16:07.056 --> 16:09.513
Well, that's nice, but...

16:10.436 --> 16:13.224
Me? Yeah, l'm naked, too.

16:17.737 --> 16:20.989
Sounds like we're ready
for the class photo.

16:22.368 --> 16:26.284
No, there's no one here.
lt was an insect, but l killed it.

16:28.001 --> 16:30.327
Listen, l'm serious about this.

16:30.504 --> 16:35.547
l would like my grade to be based
on my knowledge of geography.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.963
No, l mean it.

16:38.140 --> 16:40.430
Did l say something funny?

16:40.602 --> 16:43.308
When you see the results of my tests,

16:43.481 --> 16:47.100
you're going to be laughing out
the other side of your hemisphere.

16:47.277 --> 16:49.947
Excuse me, l've got studying to do.

16:50.114 --> 16:53.900
ls there anything in particular
l should cram?

16:55.914 --> 17:00.494
All right, but remember, l gave you
that one as a going-away present.

17:00.670 --> 17:05.665
Boy, that lady has got a mean mouth
on her for a 73-year-old.

17:05.844 --> 17:09.048
l was joking, l was joking! Hey, Coach!

17:09.223 --> 17:12.973
- Where's Coach?
- He's in the back, Sam. What's wrong?

17:13.146 --> 17:16.397
Nothing. l've got to study
for this exam. lt's important.

17:16.568 --> 17:20.067
- l'd be happy to help you study, Sam.
- l'd be proud to assist.

17:20.239 --> 17:24.320
Are you kidding me? You can't help me.
You know squat about geography.

17:24.494 --> 17:28.743
Coach, could you help me study?
We've got to start studying now.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.160
l thought you didn't need anybody.

17:31.337 --> 17:35.503
He does now. While you were earning
your grades with hard work,

17:35.677 --> 17:37.836
Sam earnt his by dating the teacher.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.840
ls that true, Sam?

17:40.016 --> 17:42.804
Yeah, but l've wiped
the slate clean, Coach.

17:42.978 --> 17:46.811
Whatever l get now, l have to earn,
so please help me cram.

17:46.983 --> 17:52.441
You mean all semester long,
l've been wearing my buns to the bone

17:52.616 --> 17:56.117
while you've been polishing
the teacher's apple?

17:57.831 --> 18:01.082
Come on, Coach.
l want to get my diploma.

18:01.253 --> 18:05.086
You know that whatever l get in this
exam is my grade for the class.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.011
Find yourself another sap to study with.

18:08.179 --> 18:12.427
- Come on, Coach.
- No way. l'm going.

18:12.601 --> 18:18.143
Oh, my God, l need help. Carla,
what do you know about geography?

18:18.318 --> 18:20.940
l know what creek you're up.

18:25.036 --> 18:30.114
Hey, guys,
would you help me study for this quiz?

18:30.293 --> 18:34.623
Maybe you could just go over the facts
with me or something?

18:34.798 --> 18:39.795
l'm sorry, Sam. l think we're too dumb
to help. Don't you, Norm?

18:39.972 --> 18:44.968
l didn't even understand the question,
Cliffie. l want to go home, l think.

18:45.145 --> 18:48.480
- l'll go home.
- Yeah, left.

18:48.651 --> 18:54.905
Right. Left. Right. Left. Right.

18:56.494 --> 19:02.500
- l can't even do that.
- Let's go home, Norm.

19:04.589 --> 19:07.425
l guess that just leaves
you and me, huh?

19:08.636 --> 19:12.717
Oh, dear, Sam. This is a problem.

19:12.892 --> 19:18.268
Frasier and l have tickets for a piece
of experimental theatre tonight.

19:18.441 --> 19:24.446
l feel obligated to go because the last
act takes place in Frasier's living room.

19:27.495 --> 19:33.784
- l'd hate to have you miss that.
- lf you want me to cancel out, l will.

19:33.962 --> 19:39.206
No, it's too late. You can't help me.
l'm going to fail this exam.

19:39.386 --> 19:43.088
l wonder if Miss Purdy's still naked. No...

19:44.185 --> 19:50.604
OK, Sam, l'll help you. You always
mess up and l always bail you out.

19:50.776 --> 19:55.605
You mess it up and l bail you out.
lt's getting a little boring.

19:55.783 --> 19:57.907
- l'm telling you.
- Thanks, Coach.

19:58.078 --> 20:01.947
- Don't you think it's getting boring?
- Yes, Coach.

20:02.125 --> 20:07.121
The only thing l can say is that Sam's
lucky to have such a forgiving friend.

20:07.299 --> 20:09.755
- Thank you.
- Good night.

20:09.927 --> 20:17.012
You can learn about anything in this
world if you just follow my little trick.

20:17.188 --> 20:19.145
Got it?

20:19.315 --> 20:21.772
Albania. Here, Albania.

20:23.195 --> 20:24.607
Or...

20:24.781 --> 20:31.236
- should we say Albania?
- Why did you say it like that?

20:31.414 --> 20:37.122
We learn our facts by associating
countries with music.

20:37.298 --> 20:39.173
Why?

20:40.260 --> 20:44.212
- Do you want to study alone?
- No.

20:44.391 --> 20:46.550
One, two, three...

20:46.728 --> 20:52.068
Albania, Albania

20:52.235 --> 20:57.777
You border on the Adriatic

20:57.951 --> 21:03.327
Your land is mostly mountainous

21:03.500 --> 21:08.460
And your chief export is chrome

21:08.632 --> 21:12.417
You're a communist republic,
You're a red regime

21:13.472 --> 21:17.636
Sing it, Sam. Ready?

21:17.811 --> 21:22.771
Albania, Albania

21:22.944 --> 21:28.615
You border on the Adriatic...

21:30.746 --> 21:34.115
Cliffie, l thought you were getting
your ears done today.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.665
l decided this is the way God made me.

21:36.836 --> 21:39.376
Who am l to question His judgement?

21:39.549 --> 21:43.001
You were wrong about the insurance
company covering it?

21:43.179 --> 21:45.219
Mostly that.

21:46.934 --> 21:51.182
Taiwan, Taiwan on the sea

21:51.357 --> 21:53.599
That China Sea

21:53.776 --> 22:00.778
Listen up, everybody! l got an A in the
tests and the best grades in the class.

22:04.917 --> 22:09.047
- How did you do, Sam?
- l got nosed out by Coach. l got a D.

22:09.215 --> 22:14.721
Ladies and gentlemen, Sam Malone
is now a high school graduate.

22:19.311 --> 22:21.850
- Congratulations.
- For what?

22:22.023 --> 22:25.524
- You passed.
- Yeah, a D as in dumb.

22:25.695 --> 22:31.154
A D as in diploma.
An honest D is better than a tainted A.

22:32.245 --> 22:36.874
Boy, l tell you, l may have my diploma,
but l sure feel dumber than ever.

22:37.043 --> 22:42.253
l studied myself hoarse for that exam
and still l got a D.

22:42.425 --> 22:44.467
Sam, you only had one night to study.

22:44.638 --> 22:49.681
lt makes no difference. My brain doesn't
work like yours. l can't learn things.

22:50.770 --> 22:54.472
Sam, some people may be better
students than others,

22:54.651 --> 22:57.273
but you have street smart, savvy...

22:57.446 --> 22:59.689
- Common sense.
- That's right.

22:59.866 --> 23:04.281
Just because you can't remember
Pierre is the capital of North Dakota

23:04.455 --> 23:06.699
doesn't mean that you should feel...

23:06.876 --> 23:10.210
- Wait a minute. Say that again.
- What?

23:10.380 --> 23:13.335
- The capital of North Dakota.
- Pierre.

23:13.510 --> 23:16.132
No, it isn't. lt's Bismarck.

23:16.305 --> 23:19.307
Pierre, South Da...
What difference does it make?

23:19.476 --> 23:23.641
- The point is you have earned your...
- Pierre?

23:23.815 --> 23:28.610
l can't believe this.
North Dakota, Pierre?

23:28.781 --> 23:32.067
Hey, listen to this for a second.
Go on, tell them.

23:32.243 --> 23:34.284
l was just making an illustration.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.828
What's the capital of North Dakota?

23:37.000 --> 23:40.120
- Easy. Bismarck.
- She thinks it's Pierre.

23:42.258 --> 23:46.339
All right, l may have inadvertently
switched the two.

23:46.513 --> 23:49.717
- Oregon. Give me the capital of Oregon.
- Portland.

23:49.893 --> 23:53.144
- No, it isn't. lt's Eugene.
- l knew that.

23:53.314 --> 23:57.182
- lt just slipped my mind.
- lt isn't Eugene. lt's Salem.

23:58.822 --> 24:01.148
Do you believe this?

24:05.455 --> 24:08.457
lgnorance is bliss. This is Eden.
