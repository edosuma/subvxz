01:12.890 --> 01:14.440
Welcome to the Taylor home.
We're about ready to start

01:14.529 --> 01:17.839
that second half of this fantastic game.
Green Bay Packers. Minnesota Vikings.

01:20.049 --> 01:23.750
Before we go down to the field.
Let's check out that snack situation.

01:23.849 --> 01:25.839
Mark, take it away.

01:26.130 --> 01:28.559
Pretzels.
liquorice, pork rinds.

01:28.650 --> 01:31.680
Yeah.
That's three major food groups right there -

01:31.769 --> 01:33.599
salt, sugar. lard.

01:34.089 --> 01:38.319
Um, all right.
Today. I got cold brewskis for me.

01:38.410 --> 01:40.869
ice-cold root brewskis
for my boys...

01:40.970 --> 01:43.000
- Dad? Here are the chips.
- You got it, buddy.

01:43.089 --> 01:45.519
- Go long.
- Nice pass, kid.

01:45.609 --> 01:47.519
All right.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.240
- Dad?
- What?

01:51.329 --> 01:54.039
You're turning all red.

02:01.769 --> 02:04.640
There's a warning label
right there.

02:04.730 --> 02:09.750
You shouldn't open these in broad daylight
in Detroit. Could cause an explosion.

02:10.568 --> 02:13.640
Wow. Look at this warning label.

02:13.730 --> 02:17.200
Socks may strike husband
unexpectedly.

02:17.289 --> 02:19.279
You could put an eye out
like that.

02:19.369 --> 02:22.400
Boys, help me clean this mess up. Second
half's about ready to begin here. Hurry up.

02:22.490 --> 02:26.190
Now, listen. Don't get too involved in that.
Tim. We have to get ready to go soon.

02:26.289 --> 02:28.480
Go?
Where are we going?

02:28.569 --> 02:31.000
Dinner, tonight.
Chez Pierre.

02:31.089 --> 02:34.789
- That can't be tonight.
- It most certainly is.

02:34.890 --> 02:36.200
Well, what about
the big game?

02:36.289 --> 02:38.319
Well, what have you been watching
all this time?

02:38.410 --> 02:41.920
This is the little game
right before the big game.

02:42.009 --> 02:45.279
The big game's the Rams and the Lions.
Why didn't you remind me about dinner?

02:45.369 --> 02:48.559
Now, don't pull that. I asked you yesterday
if you had reconfirmed the reservations.

02:48.650 --> 02:51.029
and you said. "Uh-huh." And then I said.
"Were they for seven o'clock?"

02:51.130 --> 02:52.759
And you said. "Uh-huh." And then I said.
"Did you get the baby-sitter?"

02:52.849 --> 02:55.410
And you said. "Uh-huh." So I guess that
means you didn't get the baby-sitter, huh?

02:55.490 --> 02:57.079
Uh-uh.

02:57.690 --> 02:59.480
Unbelievable.

02:59.569 --> 03:01.559
I completely forgot.

03:02.529 --> 03:05.440
We can't get a baby-sitter
at this late hour.

03:05.529 --> 03:09.359
This is
a tremendous disappointment to me.

03:09.450 --> 03:12.960
Yeah. I'll bet it is.
This was supposed to be
our romantic night out.

03:13.049 --> 03:15.000
Hey, romance?
I got it.

03:15.089 --> 03:19.799
Why don't you and I go upstairs, turn
the lights down, sit in bed, bottle of wine,

03:19.890 --> 03:23.119
and we can watch
the game up there.

03:23.210 --> 03:25.670
You're not getting out of this
with anything short of pneumonia.

03:30.369 --> 03:32.200
Boy, it's funny
you mentioned that.

03:32.289 --> 03:36.359
This morning I horked up
something nasty-looking.

03:36.970 --> 03:39.960
It shot right out of my lungs.

03:40.410 --> 03:43.920
Well, suck it back in.
We're going to dinner.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.160
Whoa!

03:47.210 --> 03:49.119
You don't whistle at guys.
you doofus.

03:49.210 --> 03:51.960
You can when they look
as handsome as your daddy.

03:52.049 --> 03:54.279
You're pretty good yourself.
sweetheart.

03:59.609 --> 04:03.599
- Put a lid on it.
- Who'd you get to baby-sit for us? Linda?

04:03.690 --> 04:06.799
No. She finds you boys
a little.., active.

04:06.890 --> 04:09.920
Good.
She smells.

04:10.930 --> 04:13.720
- Did you get Alison?
- No, honey, she's busy.

04:13.809 --> 04:15.029
But she sends her love.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.039
Stop that.
Sit, sit.

04:20.130 --> 04:21.798
Then who'd you get?

04:21.890 --> 04:23.720
Well. I found someone new.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.759
Go! Go! Go!

04:26.849 --> 04:29.200
- Tim...
- Go get the door!

04:29.970 --> 04:33.119
Please turn oﬀ
the television.

04:34.569 --> 04:36.319
- Mrs Taylor?
- Yes.

04:36.410 --> 04:40.440
Sir Larry Houdini.
world's second greatest escape artist.

04:40.529 --> 04:43.319
and magician extraordinaire.

04:43.410 --> 04:46.920
Hey, you're great. I saw you
at Chris Johnson's birthday party.

04:47.009 --> 04:50.079
- Lovely little girl.
- Chris is a boy.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.549
Strange little boy.

04:56.170 --> 05:01.599
But tell me, where are the birthday
balloons, funny party hats, the pony ride?

05:01.690 --> 05:05.279
Well, actually.
no one here's having a birthday.

05:05.369 --> 05:07.670
Well, you told me on the phone
it was a birthday.

05:07.769 --> 05:12.680
I know. I lied. I'm so sorry. I was desperate.
My husband didn't get a baby-sitter.

05:12.769 --> 05:15.230
and I called everybody I knew.
and everybody was busy.

05:15.369 --> 05:17.079
Couldn't you just please stay?

05:17.170 --> 05:18.720
Never. Never!

05:19.690 --> 05:22.640
Sir Larry has performed
prestidigitation

05:22.730 --> 05:28.720
before prime ministers, heads of state.
mo kings, and a cranky duke.

05:28.809 --> 05:34.799
and never once has he stooped
to baby-sitting to make ends meet.

05:35.809 --> 05:38.640
Haµµy birthday to yo4

05:38.849 --> 05:41.410
Haµµy birthday to yo4

05:41.490 --> 05:45.400
Haµµy birthday.., yo4r names here

05:45.490 --> 05:47.759
Haµµy birthday to yo4

05:47.849 --> 05:50.410
Thank you so much.
You don't know what this means to me.

05:50.490 --> 05:52.789
Well, boys.
the performance is about to start.

05:52.890 --> 05:57.079
so would you please help Sir Larry in
with his magical trunk?

05:57.170 --> 06:00.480
- Jill, hold on. What's going on here?
- I'm sorry.

06:00.569 --> 06:04.799
Sir Larry, this is my husband. Tim.
Tim, this is Sir Larry, the baby-sitter.

06:04.890 --> 06:07.000
- How you doing?
- And magician extraordinaire.

06:07.089 --> 06:09.839
Yeah. I bet you are. Larry.
Jill?

06:10.849 --> 06:13.880
You got a magician
to baby-sit my boys?

06:14.730 --> 06:16.480
Perfect. Perfect.

06:16.569 --> 06:20.190
Sir Larry? Uh, the number where we are
at the restaurant is right here.

06:20.329 --> 06:21.720
Call us if you have
any problems.

06:21.809 --> 06:23.920
- Whoa!
- What happened. Brad? What happened?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.880
The Lions just recovered
a fumble.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.559
- Yes!
- OK. Goodbye, boys. Goodbye. Sir Larry.

06:29.650 --> 06:33.119
- Let's go. Tim.
- We should stay and watch a trick.

06:33.210 --> 06:36.000
It's not gonna work. Tim.
Let's go.

06:38.170 --> 06:40.119
My wallet.
Left it over there by the TV.

06:40.210 --> 06:43.079
- I've got credits cards.
- Do you?

06:44.049 --> 06:47.799
- My medicine's up by the TV upstairs.
- You don't take medicine.

06:49.849 --> 06:53.630
I should take some.
I'm feeling a horker coming on.

06:57.049 --> 06:59.400
This is so romantic.

06:59.490 --> 07:01.920
And you have to admit.
it's a beautiful place.

07:02.009 --> 07:04.680
A beautiful place
for a beautiful woman.

07:05.369 --> 07:07.160
Thank you, sweetie.

07:07.289 --> 07:11.279
I really, really do appreciate this. I know
it was hard for you to leave that game.

07:11.369 --> 07:14.400
Game?
What game?

07:14.890 --> 07:17.079
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where the ladies' room is?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.279
Down the hall.
to the left.

07:19.369 --> 07:23.640
- I'll be right back.
- And I'll be right here. Jill. Right here.

07:24.650 --> 07:26.599
I'll be right here.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.269
Could you give me a hand
with this thing?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.000
Is that a radio?

07:34.089 --> 07:35.400
- Yeah.
- You got the game on?

07:35.490 --> 07:37.950
Got the game on.

07:38.049 --> 07:41.640
Take that. I wanna get that second quarter
before she gets back from the bathroom.

07:41.730 --> 07:46.400
- Oh, man. This is absolutely brilliant.
- Thanks, buddy.

07:48.970 --> 07:52.279
- So what's happening?
- Hold on a minute.

07:52.849 --> 07:54.880
- Here we go. Yes!
- What? What? What7.

07:54.970 --> 07:57.400
I don't know. Some kind of interception.
They're inside the six, first and goal.

07:57.490 --> 07:59.039
All right!
What's the score?

07:59.130 --> 08:02.000
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Rodney's in motion.

08:02.089 --> 08:03.480
Rodney Pete's back.
He's back.

08:03.569 --> 08:05.720
Jill's back.
Hi. Jill.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.519
Did you miss me?

08:12.849 --> 08:15.279
Sure I missed you.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.799
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yeah.

08:19.650 --> 08:23.119
You ever mist your neck real fast.
get one of those cricks?

08:23.210 --> 08:27.359
- Well. I got that.
- Do you want me to rub it?

08:28.690 --> 08:31.400
- Your neck?
- My neck?

08:31.490 --> 08:34.519
No. If I put my hand like this...
It feels much better now.

08:34.609 --> 08:36.400
OK.

08:36.490 --> 08:41.349
Look at this.
Endive souflé prepared with mushrooms.

08:41.450 --> 08:42.558
Yes!

08:48.009 --> 08:50.000
Mushroom.

08:51.809 --> 08:54.680
Tim, you don't like mushrooms.

08:54.769 --> 08:59.710
At home, no. But here, you know...
They're in oils and stuff here. Yeah.

08:59.809 --> 09:01.359
Look. Look.
They have your favorite, trout almondine.

09:01.450 --> 09:03.039
All right!

09:04.650 --> 09:06.160
What happened?

09:06.289 --> 09:09.039
I'm having the trout!

09:14.130 --> 09:18.279
Tim, would you like to tell me what's
going on? Why you're, uh, sitting like that?

09:18.369 --> 09:20.319
- My neck.
- Well, perhaps I should look at it.

09:20.410 --> 09:24.190
No. No, from the naked eye.
it would look like any other neck.

09:24.289 --> 09:27.599
And cricks are generally
inside necks.

09:27.690 --> 09:29.400
- Gimme your hand.
- Hey. look at that.

09:29.490 --> 09:32.480
- Gimme your other hand.
- I don't want to.

09:35.890 --> 09:38.519
Tim, give me the radio.

09:38.609 --> 09:42.230
I wasn't gonna listen
to the whole thing.

09:42.329 --> 09:44.630
- Would it help if I said I was sorry?
- It might.

09:44.730 --> 09:47.359
- I'm sorry.
- It didn't. Is this the volume?

09:53.410 --> 09:58.400
That's it, boys, nice and tight.
Sir Larry loves a challenge.

10:00.009 --> 10:02.960
- This is too cool.
- Thank you, my lad.

10:03.049 --> 10:05.430
Do we get to stick swords
in the box?

10:05.529 --> 10:11.789
Sword in the box - fantastic illusion.
Sets the mind reeling and the pulse racing.

10:11.890 --> 10:13.880
l don't do it.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.480
- Why not?
- Too easy.

10:19.529 --> 10:23.960
Now then, my lad.
will you kindly assist me into the trunk?

10:24.969 --> 10:30.440
Thank you.
Now, you will close the trunk and lock it.

10:30.530 --> 10:34.800
When I give the command.
you will set the timer at ten seconds.

10:34.889 --> 10:37.349
And when the timer
goes off...

10:37.449 --> 10:40.199
I shall appear
at the front door.

10:42.449 --> 10:45.199
I don't know -
ten seconds isn't very long.

10:45.289 --> 10:50.079
To you.
But to Sir Larry, ten seconds is an eternity.

10:51.090 --> 10:55.079
Now, boys.
prepare to be astonished.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.000
Close the lid!

11:04.489 --> 11:07.960
Is the top securely locked?

11:08.050 --> 11:14.039
- Yes, it is.
- Then set the timer and stand back.

11:37.010 --> 11:39.079
Sir Larry?

11:39.210 --> 11:41.199
Boys!

11:44.650 --> 11:47.840
Reset the timer.

11:49.530 --> 11:53.230
You know what you are. Tim.
You are a sports addict.

11:53.329 --> 11:58.599
I am not. I like sports. I have a very healthy
interest, but I am not an addict.

12:02.530 --> 12:06.559
- Is that the Lions game on in there?
- Yes. That's why service is a little slow.

12:06.650 --> 12:08.800
The staff have a television
in the kitchen.

12:12.809 --> 12:14.679
- Did you get a score?
- What's the score?

12:14.769 --> 12:18.760
I'm not sure. I know the Lions
intercepted a pass on the Rams' 20.

12:18.849 --> 12:21.039
Yes!
I bet it was Spielman.

12:21.130 --> 12:23.920
Chris Spielman, awesome player.
Last week, see him against Minnesota?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.000
See him?
Man. I was there.

12:27.969 --> 12:30.760
I can't take it. I can't take it.
I've got to see this game.

12:30.849 --> 12:33.360
Honey. I'm sorry.
I'll be back.

12:39.010 --> 12:41.389
That guy's got a problem.

12:47.210 --> 12:50.639
That guy is addicted to sports.

12:50.730 --> 12:55.239
He is out of control.

12:55.329 --> 12:58.599
- And you're not?
- No. No, no.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.920
We're here to talk about
whatever you wanna talk about.

13:01.010 --> 13:03.469
Well, that's good.
cos I wanna talk about us.

13:04.289 --> 13:05.719
You know how
we're always talking about

13:05.809 --> 13:08.679
how we need to find more things
that we can do together for fun?

13:08.769 --> 13:09.960
- Yeah.
- We always talk about it.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.679
- but we never do anything about it?
- Let's do something about it.

13:12.769 --> 13:16.760
Next weekend -
monster truck rally and tractor pull.

13:17.769 --> 13:21.679
Well, gee.
as much fun as that sounds.

13:21.769 --> 13:25.960
I was really thinking
more along the lines of...

13:26.050 --> 13:27.960
ballroom dancing.

13:28.050 --> 13:30.039
Yeah.

13:31.489 --> 13:34.199
- Boy, that was my second choice.
- No, no, really.

13:34.289 --> 13:36.920
I'm serious. I think it would really be fun
to take dancing lessons.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.679
Me? The King?
Remember college?

13:39.769 --> 13:41.719
Yeah.

13:41.809 --> 13:45.510
Tim, disco didn't die.
you killed it.

13:45.610 --> 13:49.039
No. I'm talking about grown-up dancing.
Fred and Ginger.

13:49.130 --> 13:51.590
I thought Fred married Wilma.

13:52.969 --> 13:56.360
You know what I mean. You know.
holding each close, swaying to the music.

13:56.449 --> 13:59.039
gliding across the floor.

13:59.170 --> 14:00.679
Gliding in public's not me.

14:00.769 --> 14:02.320
We can take private lessons.
just you and me.

14:04.289 --> 14:05.840
Unbelievable!

14:06.650 --> 14:07.789
Come here. You gotta see this.

14:07.889 --> 14:11.000
Sanders just broke one for 50 yards
around the right side.

14:11.090 --> 14:12.360
They tackled him
on the one.

14:12.449 --> 14:14.440
We're gonna score!
It's a first down!

14:14.530 --> 14:16.679
Happy anniversary, baby.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.719
Honey,

14:32.809 --> 14:35.269
would you like to go
and watch the game?

14:35.369 --> 14:39.639
No. No.
We were talking about...

14:43.889 --> 14:46.119
- Ballroom dancing.
- Ballroom dancing. That's what it is.

14:48.570 --> 14:52.400
So anyway.
the lessons are on Tuesday nights.

14:52.489 --> 14:55.360
And it doesn't really cost very much.

14:55.449 --> 14:59.719
And... I've been having an affair
with a space alien.

14:59.809 --> 15:03.559
Yep. I'm...
I'm having his baby.

15:06.050 --> 15:08.610
Touchdown!

15:17.730 --> 15:20.719
Honey.., go.

15:20.809 --> 15:23.440
- I'm fine. I don't have to see the game.
- No, trust me. It's OK.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.599
I really want you to go.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.559
Thank you.

15:37.929 --> 15:41.550
Hello? Hi. Mommy.
Guess what happened to Sir Larry.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.880
Mark!

15:43.969 --> 15:48.559
- Don't tell her, stupid.
- Why? We didn't do anything.

15:48.650 --> 15:53.000
The guy's locked in a box.
Who do you think she's gonna blame?

15:55.449 --> 15:58.559
Hi. Mom.
Yeah, we're fine.

15:58.650 --> 16:01.559
Yeah, he's excellent.
a lotta fun.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.559
Yeah.
Good tricks, too.

16:08.489 --> 16:12.000
Now? Well...
he can't talk right now.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.549
- She wants to talk to Mark.
- That's because she knows you'll squeal.

16:19.639 --> 16:22.309
I won't squeal.
I promise.

16:25.159 --> 16:26.470
Hello. Mommy.

16:26.559 --> 16:30.179
Brad and Randy
locked Sir Larry in the trunk.

16:35.519 --> 16:37.870
- Boys!
- It's OK. Sir Larry.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.500
If we get the trunk high enough and drop it.
it'll break open.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.159
Please. Let's not be hasty, boys.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.830
- Mom and Dad are home.
- We're dead. Hide!

16:49.799 --> 16:52.789
- Boys?
- Randy? Mark? Brad?

16:53.559 --> 16:55.549
Out here!

16:59.159 --> 17:01.620
Mark, where is Mr Houdini?

17:02.720 --> 17:03.700
In there.

17:03.799 --> 17:06.829
- Are you all right, Mr Houdini?
- I'm fine.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.390
The x-rays
may reveal otherwise however.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.108
- Mark, where are your brothers?
- I don't know, Dad.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.230
In the bushes.

17:16.799 --> 17:18.509
Here, honey.
Come here.

17:18.598 --> 17:22.269
Brad. Randy, come on out.
Come on. Come on, right now.

17:22.358 --> 17:24.029
I don't know
what gets into you guys sometimes.

17:24.118 --> 17:25.829
What'd you stuff that old man
in that trunk for?

17:25.920 --> 17:26.950
He told us to.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.549
Now, why would he want
to be put in a trunk?

17:28.640 --> 17:29.589
But he did tell us to.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.789
- Yeah, he did. It's the truth.
- He's not...

17:31.880 --> 17:35.230
The boys are speaking the truth.
They are completely innocent.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.829
Well, we'll talk about this in the morning.
It's bedtime now.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.950
- Come on. I wanna see if he gets out.
- No, no, no. I'll be up later. Go on.

17:42.039 --> 17:44.869
Honey.
we're in some kinda trouble.

17:44.960 --> 17:50.509
These are reinforced
polycarbonate American butt hinges.

17:51.839 --> 17:55.150
Sir Larry, is there anything that we can do?
Someone we can call?

17:55.240 --> 17:58.859
Yes. You can call my son.
Cyril the Magnificent.

17:58.960 --> 18:03.980
He has an extra set of keys.
and he's at 555-7653.

18:04.079 --> 18:06.460
All right.
I'll call right away.

18:06.559 --> 18:10.750
Hang in there. Sir Larry.
And just take real short little breaths.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.500
Wilson?

18:14.039 --> 18:15.910
- Howdy, neighbor.
- What are you doing over there?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.190
Just mending
the bellows on my accordion.

18:18.279 --> 18:20.549
- Cool.
- What's in the trunk?

18:20.640 --> 18:23.589
- A famous magician.
- Is he coming out of the box?

18:23.680 --> 18:25.950
As soon as his son comes over
and unlocks it.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.789
Not much of a trick. Tim.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.190
- You got a minute?
- Sure, good buddy. You got a problem?

18:32.279 --> 18:34.509
Well, it's Jill.

18:34.599 --> 18:37.710
I love her.
She's the most important thing in my life.

18:37.799 --> 18:40.359
What did you do
this time. Tim?

18:40.880 --> 18:45.069
We went out tonight to have a night just by
ourselves - real romantic, that kinda stuff -

18:45.160 --> 18:47.619
and I spoiled it because
of a football game.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.549
We won.

18:51.559 --> 18:55.099
I don't know what it is about
football and me. I'm obsessed. I think.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.829
Well, why do you think
that is. Tim?

18:57.920 --> 19:00.380
I think it's cos
I love it. Wilson.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.670
I love the surprise
and the strategy and the strength.

19:03.759 --> 19:06.670
The big guys, the logos.
the colorful helmets.

19:06.759 --> 19:08.789
The shine and the pads
and the mouth guards.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.269
The cleats and the hit and the impact.
The swearing, the sweat...

19:17.279 --> 19:19.390
Sets me free. Wilson.

19:19.480 --> 19:24.230
Well, what you're describing. Tim.
is what Aristotle would call a "catharsis".

19:24.319 --> 19:27.390
Catharsis.
How do you spell that? C...

19:27.480 --> 19:30.710
Well. Let's just say
an emotional release. Tim.

19:30.799 --> 19:35.109
Bingo. That's.., that's what I feel.
and I don't think she understands that.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.990
She doesn't have to. Tim.

19:37.079 --> 19:39.349
I'm sure there are things about her
that you don't understand.

19:39.440 --> 19:43.509
Well, you got that right. You know, that
woman has never had a haircut she liked.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.589
Well, there you go.

19:45.680 --> 19:51.029
And I go into her closet. I see 19 pairs
of black shoes. What's that all about?

19:51.119 --> 19:55.470
Well. Tim, different outfits
require different shoes.

19:55.559 --> 19:58.670
You got your pumps, your flats.
your espadrilles, your open-toes.

19:58.759 --> 20:01.710
your T-straps, your patent leather...
I could go on and on.

20:01.799 --> 20:03.150
I get the feeling you could.

20:03.240 --> 20:07.269
The point is, you and Jill don't have
to understand each other completely.

20:07.359 --> 20:13.230
What is important is to share and enjoy
the things you both do understand.

20:13.319 --> 20:16.230
That's exactly
what she was talking about, too.

20:16.319 --> 20:19.789
Sharing - she wanted to share.
But ballroom dancing?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.670
Well, why don't you give it a try. Tim?

20:21.759 --> 20:28.019
As the ancient Celtic saying goes: never
give a sword to a man who can't dance.

20:30.319 --> 20:33.230
- Sir Larry?
- Still in here.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.069
Yes. Cyril is on his way over
with the keys.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.269
Thank you.
kind madam.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.029
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:48.119 --> 20:51.630
About tonight. Jill.
I know I was stupid.

20:51.720 --> 20:56.069
I know I spoiled things.
I wanna apologize.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.859
And I won't watch
all-day football any more.

21:02.039 --> 21:04.500
What about Thanksgiving
and New Year's?

21:06.119 --> 21:07.950
Half-day.

21:09.039 --> 21:11.710
Or I'll cut out the pre-game show.
or something.

21:11.799 --> 21:15.869
I'll just try not to be
so stupid about it.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.190
- You'd do that for me?
- In a second.

21:22.119 --> 21:26.069
Well, we can always try
and do it again.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.069
Go out some evening.
have some romance.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.950
Well, we're here.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.390
We're alone.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.230
Moon's full. That's pretty romantic.
What more do you need?

21:52.279 --> 21:55.950
I'll be loving you

21:56.039 --> 21:59.269
Always

21:59.359 --> 22:02.980
With a love that's true

22:03.079 --> 22:06.230
Always

22:06.319 --> 22:09.269
When the things you planned

22:09.359 --> 22:12.900
Need a helping hand

22:13.000 --> 22:16.539
I will understand

22:16.640 --> 22:20.390
Always, always

22:20.480 --> 22:23.549
fate may not be fair

22:23.640 --> 22:26.019
Always

22:28.640 --> 22:32.630
Once you've cut the opening, you're
ready to lay the sink in there. Right? Al?

22:32.720 --> 22:34.549
That's right, Tim.

22:34.640 --> 22:38.470
You know, home improvement's
not just about renovating the kitchen.

22:38.559 --> 22:41.190
There's a lot of other ways
to improve your home.

22:41.279 --> 22:45.029
Always be aware
of your partner's needs.

22:45.119 --> 22:49.150
Take time out to share some special time
with your spouse.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.829
- Right. Al?
- I'm not married. Tim.

22:53.359 --> 22:56.470
Well, if you change those shirts
and get a haircut, or something.

22:56.559 --> 23:00.309
- I got a haircut.
- Get a better one. Al.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.509
- OK.
- All right. We drop it on "three", yeah?

23:02.599 --> 23:03.950
- On three.
- One.

23:04.039 --> 23:05.390
Two.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.829
Al?
