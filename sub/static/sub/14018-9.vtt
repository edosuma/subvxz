NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.521 --> 00:06.435
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.491 --> 00:08.300
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.360 --> 00:11.136
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.196 --> 00:12.675
These are their stories.

00:14.399 --> 00:15.707
(LAUGHING)

00:16.335 --> 00:18.212
I've been lied to by experts.

00:18.270 --> 00:23.083
Like I said, no wife, no
roommates, no live-ins.

00:23.975 --> 00:25.113
No problems, baby.

00:25.177 --> 00:26.178
(LAUGHING)

00:26.244 --> 00:27.314
(MOANING)

00:28.547 --> 00:29.548
Oh.

00:30.048 --> 00:31.152
Red lipstick?

00:31.216 --> 00:32.217
(SIGHING)

00:32.951 --> 00:34.055
My mother's.

00:34.119 --> 00:35.257
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

00:40.292 --> 00:43.364
You want a drink,
baby? Wine?

00:43.495 --> 00:46.066
Uh-huh. A glass of red
wine would be nice.

00:46.131 --> 00:47.166
All right.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.548
Are you sure
you're not married?

00:52.604 --> 00:54.481
Last time I checked.

00:54.673 --> 00:55.981

01:01.046 --> 01:02.150
(BEEPING)

01:02.214 --> 01:05.058
WOMAN OVER SPEAKER: I did it. You
don't have to worry anymore.

01:05.784 --> 01:06.854
I killed Dee-Dee.

01:06.918 --> 01:08.022
(BEEPS)

01:09.554 --> 01:10.760
Here we go.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.859
I just remembered, there's
someplace I gotta be.

01:12.924 --> 01:14.460
Oh, Come on, baby.
What's the matter?

01:14.526 --> 01:15.596
RATTINGER: No.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.230
Stop it! Stop it!
Come on.

01:17.295 --> 01:18.569
What?
(GASPS)

01:19.865 --> 01:21.003
Come on.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.947
Hey, what did I do?
Come on, now!

01:25.003 --> 01:26.038
(SIGHS)

01:26.938 --> 01:29.077
The message said,
"I killed her."

01:29.141 --> 01:30.779
Are you sure you heard right?

01:30.876 --> 01:33.880
(CLEARING THROAT) I mean, you said
yourself, you'd had a few drinks.

01:34.079 --> 01:37.185
This guy had someone killed.
It said so on the machine.

01:37.649 --> 01:38.889
And where can we find him?

01:38.950 --> 01:42.022
You know that big building on the
corner of Riverside and 114th?

01:42.087 --> 01:43.794
Well, that's where he lives.

01:43.855 --> 01:45.198
Okay.

01:45.557 --> 01:46.627
What's his name?

01:47.292 --> 01:48.532
Stanley.

01:48.927 --> 01:52.170
He said he was a fashion photographer,
but I don't know where.

01:52.230 --> 01:54.369
Okay, let me see
if I got this straight.

01:54.433 --> 01:58.506
Stanley somebody, who's a
fashion photographer someplace,

01:58.570 --> 02:03.280
lives in some apartment, probably in
a building at 114th and Riverside

02:03.341 --> 02:06.288
and has a message about
the murder of somebody

02:06.344 --> 02:07.755
who might be
named Dee-Dee.

02:07.913 --> 02:08.983
That's right.

02:09.548 --> 02:11.323
Yeah, thanks for coming in.

02:11.383 --> 02:13.420
You think you could describe
him to our sketch artist?

02:13.819 --> 02:14.889
Yes.
Good.

02:14.953 --> 02:17.160
You wait here.
We'll bring someone.

02:17.389 --> 02:19.027
Oh, this is gonna be
a slam dunk, Rey.

CRISPIN: I got Stan
Arnold, Stan Hudson,

03:10.408 --> 03:12.820
except he's in New Mexico
till the end of October.

03:12.878 --> 03:14.118
Stan Kaminski...

03:14.179 --> 03:15.817
Why don't you take a look
at the picture.

03:16.381 --> 03:18.019
Our Stanley is a photographer.

03:18.083 --> 03:21.189
About my height, dark hair, likes
to pick up women in bars...

03:21.253 --> 03:22.254
Kaminski.

03:22.587 --> 03:24.396
Did you see him
with anyone last night?

03:24.489 --> 03:27.095
When the Rangers play, I don't see
anything except the television.

03:27.158 --> 03:28.432
Where can we find him?

03:28.493 --> 03:30.769
He works in a lumber store,
West 88th.

03:32.297 --> 03:34.937
She had dark hair, skinny.
I don't remember her name.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.980
Does the name
"Ellen" ring a bell?

03:37.135 --> 03:38.273
Something happen to her?

03:38.336 --> 03:39.440
Just tell us what went on.

03:40.438 --> 03:42.918
We go back to my place.
One minute she's warming up,

03:42.974 --> 03:44.681
next thing it's a no-hitter.

03:44.943 --> 03:46.980
But I didn't touch her.
She saying I touched her?

03:47.045 --> 03:48.149
No.

03:48.213 --> 03:50.921
You return all the calls you got on
your answering machine last night?

03:50.982 --> 03:52.757
I haven't checked the messages.

03:53.184 --> 03:55.027
CURTIS: Do you know a girl
by the name of "Dee-Dee"?

03:55.086 --> 03:57.066
What's this got to do
with my answering machine?

03:57.122 --> 03:59.762
She says someone left a message
on your machine about Dee-Dee.

03:59.824 --> 04:03.704
This chick listens to my answering
machine, invading my privacy,

04:03.762 --> 04:04.866
and I'm the one
getting the third degree?

04:04.930 --> 04:06.238
Who's Dee-Dee, Stan?

04:06.298 --> 04:07.572
(LAUGHS) I don't know
any Dee-Dee.

04:07.632 --> 04:09.771
Good, then you won't mind us
listening to your messages,

04:09.834 --> 04:11.404
we'll clear this up,
and we'll be on our way.

04:11.469 --> 04:13.346
Come on, man, I'm working here.
What do you want from me?

04:13.405 --> 04:15.214
We'll square it with your boss.

04:15.473 --> 04:16.678
And I'm leaving with two cops?

04:16.741 --> 04:18.015
Well, look at
the bright side, Stan,

04:18.076 --> 04:19.885
you're not wearing handcuffs.

the clam house last Friday.

04:29.254 --> 04:30.460
I'm off the whole weekend.

04:30.522 --> 04:33.833
Have bikini, will travel, if you still
wanna go to your place in Jamaica.

Mr. Kaminski, this is
Mr. Lee from OK Cable.

Could you give us a call regarding
your outstanding balance?

05:03.955 --> 05:04.990
Yeah.

05:05.056 --> 05:06.865
Then, we're gonna need
to take the tape with us.

05:08.326 --> 05:09.566
Let me just get a pen.

05:11.429 --> 05:13.170
555-0137.

05:13.231 --> 05:14.232
What?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.379

will travel, 555-0137.

05:18.436 --> 05:19.574

05:24.776 --> 05:26.221

AUTOMATED VOICE: Thursday, 7:37 p.m.

05:42.394 --> 05:45.102
Sounds young. Probably female.
Early 20s.

05:45.163 --> 05:47.507
Maybe he got one of his
girlfriends to kill Dee-Dee.

05:47.565 --> 05:51.035
This guy's good-looking, but
not that good-looking. Thanks.

05:51.970 --> 05:55.213
Don't you have crimes with
actual bodies to investigate?

05:55.273 --> 05:57.719
It could be, she just wants
to rattle his chain.

05:57.776 --> 06:00.382
Hey, if she just wanted to make trouble
for him, she could've yelled "rape."

And last April, a Dina Perucci

06:07.452 --> 06:08.954
got an order of
protection against him.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.693
Dina... Dee-Dee?

06:11.056 --> 06:13.332
Go see if Dina's
still alive and kicking.

06:14.325 --> 06:15.429
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

06:15.493 --> 06:17.097
Miss Perucci?
Who are you?

06:17.162 --> 06:19.005
I'm Detective Briscoe,
this is Detective Curtis.

06:19.064 --> 06:21.772
I'm Theresa Green.
Dina's not home.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.004
Do you know when
she'll be back?

06:23.068 --> 06:24.570
She hasn't been
around since Monday.

06:24.869 --> 06:26.075
Is that unusual for her?

06:26.871 --> 06:28.043
We're flight attendants.

06:28.106 --> 06:30.017
Do you know her
boyfriend, Stan Kaminski?

06:30.075 --> 06:32.214
Oh, that guy?
What did he do now?

06:32.277 --> 06:34.621
Well, she had a protection
order against him.

06:34.679 --> 06:37.523
Dina breaks up with him, one
week later, 2:00 in the morning,

06:37.582 --> 06:38.720
he comes banging on our door.

06:38.783 --> 06:40.262
When's the last
time you saw her?

06:40.418 --> 06:42.830
Monday morning.
I had a flight,

06:42.887 --> 06:45.265
and when I got back,
she wasn't here.

06:46.424 --> 06:49.132
How many times do I have to tell
you, I don't know this Dee-Dee.

06:49.194 --> 06:52.903
How about Dina Perucci. You
know who she is, don't you?

06:53.264 --> 06:55.039
What's she got to do with this?

06:55.100 --> 06:57.341
She had an order of
protection against you.

06:58.369 --> 07:00.246
Dina overreacted.

07:00.672 --> 07:02.618
You like playing rough
with women, Stan?

07:02.674 --> 07:06.281
(LAUGHS) I knocked on Dina's door.
What's the big deal?

07:06.344 --> 07:09.814
The big deal is the murder confession
on your answering machine.

07:10.615 --> 07:12.151
Where's Dina?

07:13.118 --> 07:14.620
I haven't seen her in months.

07:14.786 --> 07:16.663
She jammed you up
with that restraining order.

07:16.721 --> 07:18.428
Maybe you wanted
to jam her, too?

07:18.490 --> 07:19.764
(SIGHING)

07:20.825 --> 07:23.635
Maybe the message was a
mistake, a wrong number.

07:23.695 --> 07:24.833
When I first got this number,

07:24.896 --> 07:26.773
I used to get a lot of
calls for some other guy.

07:27.465 --> 07:28.876
This other guy got a name?

07:29.334 --> 07:30.938
Ray or Roy.

07:31.002 --> 07:33.073
"Ray or Roy,"
that's all you got?

07:33.138 --> 07:34.276
Come on. Let's go.

07:34.339 --> 07:35.784
What about this other guy, Ray?

07:35.840 --> 07:38.116
When you remember anything more
about him, like his last name,

07:38.176 --> 07:40.053
tell lock-up,
they'll let us know.

07:41.446 --> 07:45.588
Hey, we heard from Worldwide Dina
Perucci's in Athens on a layover.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.129
So, Dina's not Dee-Dee.

07:47.185 --> 07:49.392
Or she is, and the phone
call was just a prank.

07:49.454 --> 07:51.991
Or she isn't, and the call
was for this guy, Roy.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.091
Listen, send
Mr. Kaminski home.

07:53.158 --> 07:54.193
Uh-huh.

07:54.259 --> 07:55.704
We don't have
the budget for this.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.637
Do you have a current address?

07:58.096 --> 07:59.769
All right. Thanks.

08:00.031 --> 08:02.739
Roy Lawlor, he had the
number before Kaminski.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.273
(SIGHS)

08:08.840 --> 08:11.218
WOMAN OVER SPEAKER: I did it. You
don't have to worry anymore.

08:11.276 --> 08:12.550
I killed Dee-Dee.

08:14.813 --> 08:16.349
Do you recognize the voice?

08:16.414 --> 08:17.688
No idea.

08:18.516 --> 08:20.462
You don't know anybody
named Dee-Dee, huh?

08:20.518 --> 08:21.553
No.

08:21.619 --> 08:23.462
Diane? Dina? Doris?

08:24.022 --> 08:26.696
Maybe somebody you met
along your route?

08:27.458 --> 08:30.371
The only people I meet are
named Roberto and Jacques.

08:30.428 --> 08:34.967
Oh, yeah, and Joe the barber. And
they're not killing each other over me.

08:36.734 --> 08:38.679
Hey, two packs a day?

08:38.736 --> 08:40.078
Ever since I quit drinking.

08:42.573 --> 08:44.383
You a friend of Bill W.?

08:45.977 --> 08:48.514
Yeah, when I quit,
I went half nuts.

08:50.348 --> 08:53.227
I went into the program
when my marriage broke up.

08:53.284 --> 08:54.592
It's still a struggle.

08:55.053 --> 08:56.930
One day at a time, huh?

08:58.590 --> 09:01.127
Sure. One long day.

09:05.864 --> 09:07.400
Roy's out in the field
most of the time.

09:07.465 --> 09:08.500
What does he cover?

09:08.566 --> 09:10.978
The Bronx, uptown Manhattan
to Lincoln Center,

09:11.035 --> 09:13.037
East Side to 86th Street.

09:13.104 --> 09:14.378
You guys are from the 15?

09:14.439 --> 09:15.474
No, 21.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.646
You know anybody at the 15?
I got parking problems.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.587
Four tickets in the past month.

09:21.346 --> 09:25.192
My guys pull up outside, double-park
for two minutes to restock,

09:25.250 --> 09:28.254
by the time they get back to
the car, there's a ticket.

09:28.319 --> 09:31.300
Listen, is Lawlor close with
any of the other salesmen?

09:31.623 --> 09:33.967
No, he doesn't spend much
time with the other guys.

09:34.025 --> 09:36.835
Most of them work out of
town, the tri-state area.

09:36.895 --> 09:38.670
Lawlor has to stay
pretty much in the city.

09:38.730 --> 09:39.800
CURTIS: How come?

09:39.864 --> 09:41.366
I couldn't get
insurance on him.

09:41.432 --> 09:43.173
Our carrier said
he was a liability.

09:43.635 --> 09:45.410
What's his problem?
DUIs?

09:45.470 --> 09:47.177
HESS: Something
under the influence.

09:48.106 --> 09:51.679
Two years ago, he got drunk,
passed out, and started a fire.

09:51.743 --> 09:52.915
Killed somebody.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.245
Who?

09:55.013 --> 09:56.924
His daughter, Diane.

09:57.982 --> 09:59.052
Dee-Dee.

09:59.984 --> 10:02.294
So, what should I do
with the parking tickets?

10:02.787 --> 10:05.427
(SIGHING) Pay them, like we do.

10:08.893 --> 10:12.033
Five-year-old kid asleep on a
daybed in a corner of the room.

10:12.096 --> 10:15.305
Fire company got there in the early
stages, but the windows were shut.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.811
Smoke inhalation.

10:16.868 --> 10:18.905
Father recovered.
Kid didn't.

10:18.970 --> 10:22.144
EMTs worked on her for 45 minutes,
but she was already dead.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.776
How did it start?
With a cigarette

10:24.108 --> 10:26.554
in the living room, near the
couch where we found Lawlor.

10:26.611 --> 10:29.114
Says here it started
three feet from the couch.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.659
Now usually, if someone
drops a cigarette,

10:30.715 --> 10:32.160
doesn't the fire
start on or near them?

10:32.216 --> 10:33.718
That's a good point.

10:33.785 --> 10:35.924
There were cigarette butts
all over the floor.

10:35.987 --> 10:38.627
I guess the investigator figured
one of them hit some newspapers.

10:38.690 --> 10:39.760
Who called it in?

10:39.824 --> 10:41.030
Neighbor's dog
started going crazy.

10:41.426 --> 10:43.064
She went into the hall,
smelled the smoke.

10:43.261 --> 10:44.365
And Lawlor says
he started the fire?

10:44.429 --> 10:45.464
After he came to.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.100
He was out when they found him.

10:47.165 --> 10:48.200
Because of the smoke
inhalation?

10:48.600 --> 10:52.673
That, and his blood alcohol was .25.
He was loaded.

10:52.937 --> 10:54.439
Where was the mother
at the time?

10:54.839 --> 10:57.877
Upstate, Saratoga.

10:59.210 --> 11:01.451
Awfully big memory lapse, Roy.

11:02.113 --> 11:03.990
You try dealing
with something like this.

11:04.048 --> 11:05.425
Who made the phone call?

11:05.483 --> 11:08.259
I don't know. Somebody's
trying to spook me.

11:08.686 --> 11:10.529
Now who'd do that?

11:11.589 --> 11:13.466
I don't know.
You want a list

11:13.524 --> 11:15.367
of the people I've pissed
off, pull up a seat.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.030
Why don't we start
with your ex-wife.

11:17.095 --> 11:18.267
ROY: (SIGHING) Come on.

11:18.463 --> 11:21.967
Don't go re-hashing it with her.
She's been through enough.

11:22.967 --> 11:24.605
She a drinker, too, Roy?

11:28.006 --> 11:29.280
You wanna tell us
where to find her?

11:30.742 --> 11:32.312
I don't know where she is.

11:32.377 --> 11:33.879
Oh, you don't keep
in touch with her?

11:35.513 --> 11:38.824
Like I said,
she's been through enough.

11:39.851 --> 11:42.457
You used my Social Security
number to look up where I work?

11:42.520 --> 11:44.227
And your boss sent us here.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.064
(SCOFFS) Can't even
drink in peace anymore.

11:47.225 --> 11:48.295
(SIGHING) Mrs. Lawlor...

11:48.359 --> 11:49.394
Call me Sandra.

11:49.894 --> 11:52.272
And you can call me Sandy.

11:52.630 --> 11:56.806
Mrs. Lawlor, we need to ask you some
questions about your daughter's death.

11:58.336 --> 12:00.043
What?
We're just following up.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.648
The report said
you were up in Saratoga.

12:03.574 --> 12:05.019
I was at a conference.

12:05.076 --> 12:07.852
What about last Thursday, around
11:00 or 12:00 in the afternoon?

12:07.912 --> 12:09.516
Do you remember where you were?

12:12.850 --> 12:15.228
I was still asleep.
I didn't get up till 1:00.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.065
It's my day off.

12:17.121 --> 12:18.532
Sleeping off a late night?

12:19.123 --> 12:20.227
(LAUGHS)

12:20.491 --> 12:22.164
All my nights are late.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.603
Did you try calling
your ex-husband that day?

12:26.230 --> 12:27.231
No, why?

12:27.298 --> 12:28.299
Somebody left him a message

12:28.733 --> 12:30.144
at his old number.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.708
Why would I call
his old number?

12:33.071 --> 12:34.948
Last time I spoke to him
was September 25th.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.319
You remember the exact date?

12:39.610 --> 12:41.783
It would've been
Dee-Dee's seventh birthday.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.792
I pulled the IUDs off
Sandra Lawlor's phone.

12:47.852 --> 12:49.525
No calls to Kaminski,

12:49.587 --> 12:52.466
but she did make some late night
calls to Roy's new number.

12:54.125 --> 12:55.900
Hmm. All calls
were a minute long.

12:56.027 --> 12:57.028
BRISCOE: Yeah,
just long enough

12:57.095 --> 12:58.540
to get the answering
machine and hang up.

12:58.596 --> 13:00.405
Lawlor was screening his calls.

13:00.531 --> 13:03.341
Yeah, and she also made about a
dozen one-minute late night calls

13:03.401 --> 13:04.471
to another number.

13:04.535 --> 13:08.642
Get this, this number is registered
to an Elaine Anderton Lawlor.

13:08.906 --> 13:10.249
Another Mrs. Lawlor?

13:10.308 --> 13:11.582
This one's on Park Avenue.

13:11.642 --> 13:13.178
Could be a sister, or an aunt.

13:13.311 --> 13:15.814
Well, whoever it is,
I pulled their IUDs, too.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.360
The confession was made
from their phone.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.290
ELAINE: Roy?

13:23.754 --> 13:25.563
We got divorced
eight years ago.

13:25.623 --> 13:28.433
He moved to the West Side
six, seven months ago.

13:28.493 --> 13:29.904
I haven't talked to him since.

13:29.961 --> 13:31.599
What about Sandra Lawlor?

13:31.929 --> 13:33.704
His second wife?

13:34.198 --> 13:38.237
That drunk calls at all hours, complaining
about me, complaining about him.

13:38.870 --> 13:40.645
Is Roy in some kind of trouble?

13:40.772 --> 13:42.809
We're looking into the death
of his daughter, Diane.

13:43.274 --> 13:45.276
Uh-huh. And?

13:45.343 --> 13:48.722
Someone left a message on an answering
machine confessing to the arson.

13:48.946 --> 13:50.653
Well, what does that
have to do with me?

13:51.048 --> 13:52.994
The call came
from this apartment.

13:53.818 --> 13:55.195
That's impossible.

13:55.253 --> 13:57.096
Introduce me
to your friends, Elaine.

13:57.155 --> 13:59.396
Daddy, these are
police detectives.

13:59.824 --> 14:01.235
Oh, is there a problem?

14:01.292 --> 14:04.933
They're saying someone used our phone
to confess to killing Roy's daughter.

14:05.129 --> 14:06.506
Well, someone's
pulling your leg.

14:06.564 --> 14:08.407
Be that as it may, the phone
records show the call...

14:08.466 --> 14:09.911
In my business,
I only trust records

14:09.967 --> 14:11.913
that I can prove haven't
been tampered with.

14:12.837 --> 14:15.545
Well, why would somebody want to
tamper with your phone records?

14:15.606 --> 14:18.815
(CLICKING TONGUE) My daughter is
no longer married to that drunk.

14:19.076 --> 14:23.024
If you have questions about the
fire, talk to him. He set it.

14:23.881 --> 14:26.623
He destroyed one life, he
nearly destroyed my daughter's.

14:26.817 --> 14:29.661
Now, this is my lawyer. You can talk
to him to your heart's content.

14:30.354 --> 14:32.891
Now, if you'll please leave,
I'd appreciate it.

14:33.824 --> 14:34.825
Thank you.

14:34.892 --> 14:35.927
Who works for the Andertons?

14:35.993 --> 14:40.135
Yeah, you got two housekeepers,
Elsie Ruiz and Anne Ryan,

14:40.198 --> 14:44.112
the cook, Emma Hooper,
the chauffeur, a secretary,

14:44.168 --> 14:45.613
people going in
and out all the time.

14:45.736 --> 14:46.771
Ages?

14:46.837 --> 14:48.214
Ruiz is around 60.

14:48.406 --> 14:49.646
And Ryan?

14:49.707 --> 14:52.210
50s. Hooper,
maybe 40, 45.

14:52.743 --> 14:54.120
Anybody else?

14:54.178 --> 14:56.522
No, just Mr. Anderton,
his daughter and her kid.

14:56.581 --> 14:57.616
Her kid?

14:57.682 --> 14:58.717
Yeah, Terry.

14:58.783 --> 15:01.229
Him and his mother have lived with
Mr. Anderton since her divorce.

15:01.285 --> 15:02.855
How old is Terry?

15:02.920 --> 15:05.457
Teenager, like 14, 15.

15:06.023 --> 15:07.297
High-pitched voice?
Yeah.

15:07.892 --> 15:09.769
Where is he now?
He's at school.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.704
Their chauffeur brings
him home around 4:00.

15:11.762 --> 15:13.070
All right, thanks.
Sure.

15:13.631 --> 15:15.008
The kid?
The kid.

15:15.066 --> 15:17.672
I doubt the Andertons are gonna
volunteer him for a voice sample.

15:17.735 --> 15:19.772
Maybe he'll volunteer
one himself.

15:25.009 --> 15:28.513
Hey, kid! We're looking
for the Metropolitan Museum.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.957
Yeah, take a left right there,

15:31.015 --> 15:33.552
go three blocks over,
and go straight up Fifth.

15:33.618 --> 15:36.121
Okay, right there, and
then three blocks over?

15:36.187 --> 15:39.327
No, no, no. First left.
Go to Fifth

15:39.390 --> 15:41.267
and go all the way up to the 80s.
You can't miss it.

15:41.325 --> 15:43.498
Oh, thanks,
nice talking to you.

15:47.298 --> 15:49.801
The kid's voice barely
registers 50 decibels.

15:49.867 --> 15:53.542
Even with a filter, 60%
match is what I can do.

15:54.038 --> 15:55.381
Thanks.

15:55.806 --> 15:58.912
60% is about 20% short
of an arrest warrant.

15:59.110 --> 16:01.420
Let's take a look
at the arson evidence.

16:01.979 --> 16:05.324
BRISCOE: Five cigarette
butts, some newspapers,

16:05.483 --> 16:06.757
a couple of matchbooks.

16:06.817 --> 16:08.922
CURTIS: The Connaught Hotel,
London.

16:08.986 --> 16:11.967
Yeah, my first wife wanted
to stay there one night.

16:12.223 --> 16:13.998
I figured out
we could afford one hour.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.502
That seem like Roy
Lawlor's kind of place?

16:16.761 --> 16:20.607
Not the Roy Lawlor I saw, but it's
right up Carl Anderton's alley.

16:21.966 --> 16:23.070
Where was it found?

16:24.502 --> 16:25.776
On the floor, in the hallway.

16:26.103 --> 16:27.639
Was it ever checked for prints?

16:27.705 --> 16:28.809
No.

16:30.875 --> 16:31.910
Huh.

16:31.976 --> 16:34.980
Geniuses. The cardboard
has an acetate finish.

16:35.246 --> 16:38.989
It's not too damaged. They should
have been able to lift a print.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.756
Maybe they still can.

16:42.119 --> 16:44.793
Latent found a print on the matchbook.
It's not Roy's.

16:44.855 --> 16:45.856
Whose?

16:45.923 --> 16:48.927
Well, the size of the print looks
like it could belong to a kid.

16:48.993 --> 16:50.267
What else do you got?

16:50.328 --> 16:52.501
A 60% voice match
on the phone call.

16:52.563 --> 16:57.012
Only 60%? Carl Anderton sits on the
Mayor's re-election committee.

16:57.068 --> 16:59.844
Hey, if he sat in a booth collecting
tolls for the Lincoln Tunnel,

16:59.904 --> 17:01.747
we'd be arresting
his grandson by now.

17:01.806 --> 17:03.410
What's that supposed to mean?

17:03.641 --> 17:04.847
You've got...
BRISCOE: We've got a print,

17:04.909 --> 17:05.979
we've got a confession.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.145
Motive?

17:07.578 --> 17:09.558
It's the kid's half-sister.
You don't have to be

17:09.613 --> 17:11.148
a genius to come
up with something.

17:12.016 --> 17:13.154
Then come up with something.

17:15.051 --> 17:16.087
What about the father?

17:16.153 --> 17:17.689
He's had plenty
of opportunities

17:17.755 --> 17:19.257
to implicate his son,
but he hasn't.

17:19.356 --> 17:20.460
The little girl's mother?

17:20.523 --> 17:22.765
If she had anything to say
about Terry and the fire,

17:22.827 --> 17:24.464
she would've said it by now.

17:24.528 --> 17:26.303
What about the people
who live with the boy?

17:26.364 --> 17:28.901
I'm sure there's no shortage of
household help at the Andertons'.

17:29.033 --> 17:32.344
Yeah. If they worked there two
years ago, if we can find them,

17:32.403 --> 17:34.041
and if they'll talk to us.

17:34.672 --> 17:36.618
I have confidence in you.

17:41.278 --> 17:42.723
When I worked
for Mr. Anderton,

17:42.780 --> 17:44.623
he had me sign
a confidentiality agreement.

17:44.682 --> 17:46.320
Well, he can't stop you
from talking to us.

17:46.384 --> 17:49.854
A little girl died in a fire
we think Terry might've set.

17:49.954 --> 17:51.592
He makes all his
employees sign one.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.225
This girl was five years old.

17:53.391 --> 17:55.029
Come on. You gonna
wait for a subpoena?

17:55.092 --> 17:57.766
Sooner or later, you're
gonna have to talk to us.

18:03.601 --> 18:05.774
After the fire,
Terry stayed in his room,

18:05.836 --> 18:08.339
drawing pictures
of that poor little girl.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.045
CURTIS: Did
he talk about her?

18:10.107 --> 18:11.279
Only to his father.

18:11.709 --> 18:13.552
Terry would call him
in the middle of the night.

18:13.778 --> 18:16.258
I could hear him from the other
room, talking on and on.

18:16.313 --> 18:17.417
BRISCOE:
About what?

18:17.481 --> 18:19.859
Well, Terry could only see
his father on the weekends.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.260
He blamed the little girl.

18:21.619 --> 18:23.292
What else did he say about her?

18:23.387 --> 18:25.958
He said she was trying to
turn his father against him.

18:26.023 --> 18:28.469
A little girl.
It was crazy.

18:28.826 --> 18:30.737
I thought maybe
he was on drugs.

18:31.128 --> 18:33.540
After the fire,
Terry stopped calling him.

18:33.597 --> 18:35.099
Did Terry use drugs?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.736
I don't think so.

18:38.536 --> 18:40.982
Do you know where he was
the night of the fire?

18:42.006 --> 18:43.451
I don't know.

18:44.842 --> 18:46.082
Two weeks after the fire,

18:46.143 --> 18:48.453
I checked through a bag of
clothes for The Salvation Army.

18:48.713 --> 18:50.192
Why would you do that?

18:50.881 --> 18:54.055
Well, they throw things out.
Lots of stuff is still good.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.663
So, you looked in the bag...

18:55.719 --> 18:57.062
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

18:58.789 --> 18:59.790
I found a shirt.

18:59.857 --> 19:00.858
CURTIS: And?

19:02.126 --> 19:03.662
You could still
smell the smoke.

19:04.462 --> 19:05.873
Was it one of Terry's shirts?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.538
WOMAN: Come on, sweetie.

19:15.272 --> 19:16.842
CURTIS: Terry Lawlor.

19:16.907 --> 19:18.386
What do you think you're doing?

19:18.509 --> 19:19.852
We have a warrant
for your son, ma'am.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.355
Terry Lawlor,
you're under arrest

19:21.412 --> 19:22.789
for the murder of Diane Lawlor.

19:22.847 --> 19:24.724
Mom... It's okay. It's
a misunderstanding.

19:24.782 --> 19:26.090
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:26.150 --> 19:27.390
You have the right
to an attorney.

19:27.451 --> 19:28.896
You can talk to
my lawyer about this.

19:28.953 --> 19:31.763
We'll be happy to talk to you and
your lawyer down at the precinct.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.358
Getting in?

19:34.692 --> 19:36.296
You bastards.

19:41.799 --> 19:43.574
Well, I don't like it,

19:43.634 --> 19:46.706
my grandson having to wear some sort
of electronic monitoring device

19:46.770 --> 19:48.010
while he's out on bail.

19:48.072 --> 19:50.018
All due respect, if he
weren't your grandson,

19:50.074 --> 19:51.951
he might not
even be out on bail.

19:52.009 --> 19:56.151
With all due respect, Mr. McCoy,
if he weren't my grandson,

19:56.547 --> 19:58.652
he wouldn't even have been
charged with the crime.

19:58.716 --> 20:01.162
Mr. McCoy, Terry Lawlor's
a good kid.

20:01.318 --> 20:04.458
Whose prints were found at an arson
that killed another good kid.

20:04.688 --> 20:06.292
Well, that's not enough
to prove that my grand...

20:06.357 --> 20:08.268
We have enough for a trial.

20:08.592 --> 20:10.196
Or could we talk about a plea?

20:10.361 --> 20:14.036
No, no. We're here to talk
about dropping the charges.

20:14.398 --> 20:15.900
We'll talk about a plea
with the boy's mother.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.070
I'm his guardian.

20:17.368 --> 20:21.214
I make all decisions concerning him.
You'll talk to me, Mr. McCoy.

20:21.405 --> 20:24.147
The arson squad closed
this case two years ago.

20:24.608 --> 20:26.781
A drunk named
Roy Lawlor did it.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.550
This case is not
about Roy Lawlor.

20:28.612 --> 20:31.058
Nor, for that matter, is it
about you, Mr. Anderton.

20:31.115 --> 20:33.095
Oh, it certainly is about me.

20:33.417 --> 20:35.954
No way you'll prove
Terry set that fire.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.897
We have his confession on tape.

20:38.122 --> 20:39.601
Not for long.

20:41.725 --> 20:43.705
It's a motion
for an audibility hearing.

20:43.761 --> 20:48.437
A 60% voice match
is crap, and you know it.

20:54.805 --> 20:56.284
WEAVER: Six reports

20:56.340 --> 20:59.082
from three different
nationally recognized experts

20:59.143 --> 21:03.819
comparing the tape to my client's
voice and to five random samples.

21:04.048 --> 21:06.551
My wife's voice
was a 50% match.

21:06.984 --> 21:09.157
We're not offering a
conclusive match, Your Honor,

21:09.220 --> 21:11.257
but a probable one in light
of the other evidence.

21:11.322 --> 21:14.303
Your Honor, the tape
was altered in the lab.

21:14.725 --> 21:17.729
The call to the answering machine
came from his client's home.

21:17.795 --> 21:19.433
That may be so,
but whether or not

21:19.496 --> 21:21.407
my client made
the call is the issue.

21:21.832 --> 21:23.971
JUDGE SIMONS: Mr. McCoy,
the tape was enhanced,

21:24.034 --> 21:27.413
and produced a voice
match disputed by experts.

21:28.005 --> 21:29.177
By defense experts.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.049
I also heard your experts.

21:31.342 --> 21:32.650
I listened to the tapes

21:32.710 --> 21:36.089
and I can't tell that the two
voices are from the same person.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.122
Given the inflammatory nature
of the tape's content,

21:39.383 --> 21:41.021
I'm going to suppress it.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.790
Carl Anderton's grandson.
Carl's a good man.

21:47.291 --> 21:50.067
We worked on the Lindsay
campaign together.

21:50.561 --> 21:52.234
We're not prosecuting him.

21:52.296 --> 21:55.175
The boy obviously feels
repentant for what he did.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.041
He called his father,
didn't he?

21:57.334 --> 21:58.472
You offered a plea?

21:58.535 --> 21:59.639
We got turned down.

21:59.703 --> 22:01.649
What kind of plea?
We didn't get that far.

22:01.705 --> 22:03.742
He turned down
the idea of a plea.

22:03.807 --> 22:05.753
Adam, why are we
pussyfooting around?

22:05.876 --> 22:09.915
The man has a $4 billion
war chest. Three years ago,

22:10.314 --> 22:14.456
the Atlantic-Star Cable merger,
he took on the SEC and won.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.560
He's rich, he's powerful.

22:16.620 --> 22:18.725
Maybe we should let
Robin Leach try the case.

22:18.789 --> 22:21.030
Carl Anderton
brought down a governor,

22:21.558 --> 22:25.335
put senators in office, and now
he's fighting for his grandson.

22:28.899 --> 22:30.310
I'm not kissing his ass, Adam.

22:30.367 --> 22:32.870
I want you to
treat him with respect.

22:34.371 --> 22:36.578
He gets the same from me
as everybody else.

22:38.042 --> 22:39.817
I don't care who he is.

22:42.379 --> 22:43.414
(DOOR OPENING)

22:43.480 --> 22:45.426
Bobby Kennedy sat right
in that chair over there,

22:45.482 --> 22:46.722
smoking Monte Cruise,

22:47.284 --> 22:49.855
right after we signed the
Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Agreement.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.558
Remember?
Yeah.

22:51.822 --> 22:52.857
You were sitting at...

22:52.923 --> 22:54.334
I stood right over there.

22:56.093 --> 22:59.563
Yeah. That's right.
You want something, Adam?

22:59.630 --> 23:01.234
No, thank you.

23:04.435 --> 23:07.006
You know why I'm here.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.743
We've been through some
rough times together, Carl.

23:10.874 --> 23:12.478
This is gonna be another one.

23:12.843 --> 23:14.948
It's just gonna
end up a bloody mess.

23:15.713 --> 23:18.592
Adam, if you wanted to,
you could make it go away.

23:19.216 --> 23:21.526
(SIGHING)
Your grandson confessed.

23:21.585 --> 23:22.962
No, that was no confession.

23:23.387 --> 23:25.731
Terry was just trying to
make his father feel better.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.899
The boy has a good heart.

23:28.492 --> 23:33.202
There's other evidence. A plea
bargain is the best way to go.

23:36.033 --> 23:39.207
When is your term up?
Is it next spring, what?

23:41.338 --> 23:42.408
What are you implying?

23:42.573 --> 23:44.484
Don't misunderstand me.

23:46.110 --> 23:47.646
We go back a long way.

23:50.014 --> 23:51.994
It was a different city.

23:52.850 --> 23:56.491
But you know, the important
things, loyalty and friendship,

23:57.087 --> 23:58.828
they haven't changed.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.626
No, they haven't.

24:01.492 --> 24:04.166
He's my only grandson, Adam,

24:06.230 --> 24:08.767
and you were
at his mother's wedding.

24:09.500 --> 24:13.141
I've got pictures of you holding
the boy when he was a baby.

24:13.237 --> 24:16.241
I'm sorry, Carl. There's a
plea offer on the table.

24:16.607 --> 24:19.588
Take it, don't take it,
it's up to you.

24:19.643 --> 24:24.592
Adam, you deny me
this personal request?

24:28.385 --> 24:30.422
I can't do this, my friend.

24:32.856 --> 24:34.096
I won't.

24:38.495 --> 24:39.667
(INHALES DEEPLY)

24:40.697 --> 24:44.736
A fingerprint on an old
matchbook and a smelly shirt,

24:46.737 --> 24:48.910
not the strongest case
I've ever taken to trial.

24:48.972 --> 24:52.249
It might help if we could tell a jury
what turned Terry into an arsonist.

24:53.310 --> 24:56.416
He was angry at his father. That's
an emotion I can understand.

24:57.514 --> 24:59.118
Something pushed him
over the edge.

25:00.951 --> 25:04.091
The nanny suspected drugs. It'd
be nice to be able to prove it.

25:04.221 --> 25:06.599
I checked the school records,
medical records, insurance,

25:06.657 --> 25:08.762
there's no sign
he ever had a drug problem.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.037
What about friends?

25:11.161 --> 25:12.572
I haven't found any.

25:12.996 --> 25:15.806
And I can't get anybody at his school
to say anything bad about him.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.339
They're afraid of losing
a future endowment.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.979
What about other schools
the boy attended?

25:22.172 --> 25:25.984
Selwyn Academy. The prep he was
at when the fire occurred.

25:26.243 --> 25:27.449
They won't talk to me either.

25:28.412 --> 25:29.550
That their yearbook?

25:29.613 --> 25:30.614
Mmm-hmm.

25:35.085 --> 25:37.326
Looks pretty harmless
in a jacket and tie.

25:37.387 --> 25:38.730
You all do.

25:39.089 --> 25:41.763
Yeah. Oh, look, here.

25:42.893 --> 25:44.133
They had a school counselor.

25:45.095 --> 25:47.405
If the kid was doing drugs,
maybe she'll know about it.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.175
Drugs weren't his problem.

25:53.237 --> 25:55.444
Maybe he would've been
better off if they were.

25:55.506 --> 25:56.644
What was his problem?

25:56.707 --> 25:57.777
His real problem?

25:58.308 --> 25:59.787
I never got
the chance to find out.

26:00.511 --> 26:03.492
But his behavior in school
was something else.

26:03.981 --> 26:04.982
A handful?

26:05.282 --> 26:06.625
Depending on when
you caught him.

26:06.683 --> 26:08.924
He could be a charmer one week,

26:08.986 --> 26:11.159
and then an absolute
monster the next.

26:11.221 --> 26:14.532
He'd get in these funks, and I could
hardly get a word out of him.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.537
Given his home life, wouldn't
you expect him to be moody?

26:17.961 --> 26:19.872
It wasn't about that.

26:19.930 --> 26:23.571
He decided to run for Student
President of the middle school.

26:24.134 --> 26:27.877
He had a very well-articulated
platform, posters, the whole bit.

26:28.739 --> 26:30.650
A week before the election,
he withdrew.

26:31.575 --> 26:34.556
I asked him why.
He went into a diatribe

26:34.611 --> 26:38.650
about the other candidate sabotaging
his campaign, planting spies.

26:39.082 --> 26:40.254
Was it true?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.891
He said he could hear them
whispering through the walls.

26:50.627 --> 26:54.268
Paranoia, schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder...

26:55.065 --> 26:56.339
You expect me
to make a diagnosis

26:56.400 --> 26:58.380
based on the observations
of an amateur?

26:58.435 --> 27:00.642
Yeah. You got
a problem with that?

27:02.806 --> 27:07.880
Okay. He can't relate to others,
has low tolerance for frustration,

27:07.945 --> 27:09.754
he's unpredictable...

27:10.681 --> 27:11.989
So far, that's my kid.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.728
Now, the fear and suspicion, the
whispering through the walls,

27:17.254 --> 27:19.564
sounds like he's in the early
stages of bipolar disorder.

27:20.223 --> 27:21.531
Bipolar disorder.

27:21.591 --> 27:24.333
Alternating cycles
of depression and mania.

27:25.095 --> 27:26.938
Periods of feeling
better than normal,

27:26.997 --> 27:29.341
brighter and more
energetic and charming,

27:29.666 --> 27:31.907
hyper-sexuality
and poor judgment.

27:32.336 --> 27:35.715
Then, suddenly
irritability, aggression,

27:36.139 --> 27:39.814
delusions of persecution,
hearing voices.

27:40.477 --> 27:41.751
That's what's going on
with this kid?

27:41.812 --> 27:44.486
It's a third-hand diagnosis.
Take it for what it's worth.

27:45.415 --> 27:47.486
But it might explain
why the kid's a fire bug.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.262
If he's crazy,
why isn't his lawyer

27:51.321 --> 27:53.301
going for an insanity defense?

27:57.994 --> 27:59.132
Good question.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.546
Bipolar disorder?

28:05.602 --> 28:08.412
I think you need your
head examined, Mr. McCoy.

28:08.805 --> 28:10.944
We didn't just pull
this out of thin air.

28:11.074 --> 28:13.884
We talked to a former school
counselor, to his friends...

28:13.977 --> 28:16.685
People with impeccable credentials
in the field of psychiatry.

28:16.747 --> 28:19.819
The behavior they observed can't
be explained any other way.

28:19.883 --> 28:24.161
Mr. Anderton, I don't have any
interest in prosecuting your grandson

28:24.221 --> 28:25.723
if he has a mental disease.

28:25.789 --> 28:27.826
There is nothing
wrong with Terry.

28:27.891 --> 28:30.064
Then, you won't mind if our
psychiatrist examines him.

28:30.127 --> 28:32.300
WEAVER: So you can gather
evidence against him?

28:32.562 --> 28:33.597
I don't think so.

28:33.663 --> 28:35.438
JACK: It would be off the record.
You have nothing to lose.

28:35.499 --> 28:38.537
Mr. Anderton, your grandson
needs treatment, not prison.

28:38.602 --> 28:42.175
The way your case is going, he
doesn't have to worry about prison.

28:42.472 --> 28:45.942
Sir, your grandson
killed that little girl.

28:46.977 --> 28:50.515
Either in prison or in a psychiatric
hospital, he's going to answer for it.

28:50.747 --> 28:55.696
At the end of this, Mr. McCoy, my
grandson is coming home with me.

29:02.526 --> 29:07.100
We'll see what a judge has to say about that.
I'm moving for a 730 exam.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.880
Your Honor, I've brought this
motion in the interest of justice.

29:13.203 --> 29:15.615
Aren't the defendant's best
interests served by his counsel?

29:15.672 --> 29:18.016
Unless counsel refuses
to acknowledge the obvious.

29:18.074 --> 29:19.212
What obvious?

29:19.276 --> 29:21.847
Your Honor, the defendant
hasn't been howling at the moon

29:21.912 --> 29:23.255
or ripping his hair out.

29:23.313 --> 29:24.348
He's not crazy.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.054
If there's nothing wrong with his
client, then a 730 exam can't...

29:27.117 --> 29:31.088
A pointless proceeding that can
only be to my client's detriment.

29:31.154 --> 29:34.624
The prosecutors can question him
in violation of his rights.

29:34.691 --> 29:38.400
Mr. McCoy, if his client's
mental condition is so obvious,

29:38.628 --> 29:41.199
then it should be apparent
if I talk to him.

29:41.498 --> 29:45.344
I'll question him in chambers and
decide if your motion has merit.

29:45.435 --> 29:47.278
I'd like our psychiatrist
to observe.

29:47.337 --> 29:48.475
Absolutely not.

29:48.705 --> 29:51.413
I'll decide what goes on
in my chambers, Mr. Weaver.

29:51.775 --> 29:56.383
Mr. McCoy's psychiatrist can observe, but
I'll be the one asking the questions.

29:56.446 --> 29:57.857
BAILIFF: The court
is back in session.

29:58.048 --> 29:59.049
Judge Jane...

29:59.116 --> 30:00.288
JUDGE SIMONS:
So you understand

30:00.350 --> 30:02.830
everything that's happened
in this case so far?

30:02.886 --> 30:04.126
Yes, ma'am.

30:04.521 --> 30:06.228
And how do you feel
about all this?

30:07.457 --> 30:08.561
Scared.

30:09.259 --> 30:13.002
Understandable. And how
is it for you, at home?

30:13.263 --> 30:15.106
Well, I've been playing
a lot of Nintendo.

30:15.165 --> 30:17.839
I can't really rollerblade
with this thing on.

30:22.472 --> 30:26.284
Thank you for coming in. You can
wait for Mr. Weaver outside.

30:29.579 --> 30:30.887
(DOOR OPENING)

30:33.183 --> 30:34.218
(DOOR CLOSING)

30:34.284 --> 30:36.696
He seems like
a normal teenager to me.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.664
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

30:38.722 --> 30:40.565
I would have asked
different questions.

30:40.957 --> 30:43.904
That's why you were allowed
here only as an observer.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.530
Your Honor,
Dr. Skoda's point is...

30:45.595 --> 30:48.098
Mr. McCoy, I don't care
what his point is.

30:49.166 --> 30:52.204
I'm satisfied that the
defendant is of sound mind.

30:52.436 --> 30:55.849
Your motion
for a 730 exam is denied.

30:57.474 --> 30:59.078
DR. SKODA: I'm not
a mind reader, Jack.

30:59.142 --> 31:01.418
"Hi, how are you?" is not
a diagnostic question.

31:01.478 --> 31:02.889
You can't tell me anything?

31:03.547 --> 31:06.721
He likes rollerblading
and Nintendo. So do I.

31:07.217 --> 31:09.424
I don't get it. They should've
jumped at a chance for the exam.

31:09.486 --> 31:10.988
They think
they're going to win.

31:11.188 --> 31:14.397
The way things are going, they're
probably right. So now what?

31:14.524 --> 31:15.867
We go to trial.

31:16.626 --> 31:19.334
If they won't use his mental state
to get him acquitted, fine,

31:19.830 --> 31:23.744
we'll use it to convict him. He set
the fire because he's deluded.

31:24.201 --> 31:26.738
If he has a mental disease, he
doesn't belong in prison, Jack.

31:27.137 --> 31:28.309
Maybe it won't
come down to that.

31:28.371 --> 31:29.509
And what if it does?

31:30.607 --> 31:32.211
That's what they pay us for.

31:36.546 --> 31:41.518
After Dee-Dee was born, Terry
became aggressive with her.

31:42.486 --> 31:43.897
JACK: In what way?

31:44.087 --> 31:46.328
Squeezing her too hard,
for one thing.

31:46.423 --> 31:48.232
Did you discuss this
with your husband?

31:49.326 --> 31:52.500
I told Roy I didn't
want Terry around her.

31:52.629 --> 31:55.803
I was afraid
he might do something.

31:57.134 --> 31:59.774
We cut his visits to just
weekends, when I could be there.

31:59.836 --> 32:02.077
Why didn't you tell the
police any of this before?

32:02.305 --> 32:05.684
I didn't think it mattered. Roy
said the fire was his fault.

32:06.610 --> 32:08.021
Thank you.
Nothing further.

32:10.347 --> 32:12.293
Mrs. Lawlor,
were there any witnesses,

32:12.349 --> 32:15.296
other than yourself,
who saw Terry hug Diane?

32:16.019 --> 32:18.090
(SCOFFS) No.

32:19.022 --> 32:20.057
Do you drink?

32:20.123 --> 32:21.158
Objection. Relevance.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.002
Goes to credibility.

32:23.727 --> 32:26.139
Overruled.
Answer the question.

32:26.529 --> 32:28.509
I have a few drinks every day.

32:28.732 --> 32:32.373
And isn't it true that on two
occasions you and your husband

32:32.435 --> 32:36.110
got into a fight so severe
neighbors had to call the police?

32:36.172 --> 32:37.173
Yes, but...

32:37.240 --> 32:41.154
That this was an example of the kind
of home you and Roy Lawlor kept,

32:41.211 --> 32:44.055
and it was Terry's mother
and grandfather...

32:44.114 --> 32:45.149
JACK: Objection.

32:45.215 --> 32:46.853
...who curtailed
Terry's visits, not you,

32:46.917 --> 32:48.919
because they feared
for his safety?

32:48.985 --> 32:50.157
He's testifying, Your Honor.

32:50.220 --> 32:51.290
Sustained.

32:51.621 --> 32:54.761
The jury will disregard
Mr. Weaver's last remark.

32:55.158 --> 32:56.967
WEAVER: No further questions.

32:59.029 --> 33:02.533
On certain occasions Terry told me
he thought he was being persecuted.

33:03.133 --> 33:05.374
For example, toward the
end of the school year,

33:05.435 --> 33:08.712
Terry was convinced that the other
students were conspiring against him.

33:08.772 --> 33:10.080
Did he tell you
how he knew this?

33:10.173 --> 33:11.914
Objection.
Hearsay.

33:12.309 --> 33:14.983
The testimony isn't offered to
prove the truth of the statement,

33:15.545 --> 33:18.151
but to demonstrate the defendant's
state of mind at the time.

33:18.648 --> 33:21.151
JUDGE SIMONS: Overruled.
The witness will answer.

33:21.551 --> 33:23.360
GAREY: He said he could
hear the other students...

33:23.420 --> 33:25.866
Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?

33:30.427 --> 33:32.566
This witness is
a high school counselor.

33:32.896 --> 33:35.900
She's not accredited by any
graduate school of psychiatry

33:35.966 --> 33:37.172
or psychology...

33:37.233 --> 33:40.237
She isn't being asked to offer
a professional diagnosis,

33:40.303 --> 33:43.978
but only to describe observed behavior,
which any lay person can do.

33:44.274 --> 33:45.309
He's right,
Mr. Weaver.

33:46.543 --> 33:49.615
Your Honor, in her capacity
as school counselor,

33:49.679 --> 33:52.751
anything she was told by my client
falls under patient privilege.

33:52.816 --> 33:54.193
He can't have it both ways.

33:54.417 --> 33:57.193
Either she's a qualified mental
health practitioner or she isn't.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.634
You really can't, Mr. Weaver.
Now step back.

34:02.025 --> 34:05.370
Ms. Garey, please answer
Mr. McCoy's question.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.704
GAREY: He told me he could
hear the other students

34:08.764 --> 34:10.745
whispering about him
through the walls.

34:11.301 --> 34:14.475
What, if any, other behavior did
you notice around this time?

34:14.771 --> 34:16.614
Your Honor,
we request a recess.

34:16.672 --> 34:18.118
For what purpose?

34:18.440 --> 34:20.387
To consult with
the District Attorney.

34:20.677 --> 34:21.678
Mr. McCoy?

34:21.745 --> 34:22.746
We have no objection.

34:22.879 --> 34:25.052
Very well.
Court is now in recess.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.219
We will reconvene
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

34:27.650 --> 34:28.788
(GAVEL POUNDS)

34:29.319 --> 34:32.027
We're prepared to plead
to second degree manslaughter.

34:32.755 --> 34:35.929
That fire was an accident.
There was no premeditation.

34:36.126 --> 34:38.902
And Terry certainly
didn't mean to hurt anyone.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.368
You'd let him go to jail?

34:40.496 --> 34:43.774
We're talking minimum time
in a juvenile facility.

34:44.467 --> 34:46.913
Prison is prison.

34:47.871 --> 34:50.612
Mr. Anderton, do you really think
that's where your grandson belongs?

34:50.672 --> 34:51.947
That's where you
want to send him.

34:52.042 --> 34:55.080
You heard the testimony. Your
grandson needs psychiatric help.

34:55.311 --> 34:56.483
Absolutely not!

34:56.545 --> 34:58.116
I don't understand
you, Mr. Anderton.

34:58.181 --> 34:59.990
We're offering him...
What?

35:00.050 --> 35:01.723
The chance to stay
in a loony bin

35:01.785 --> 35:04.322
till some state employee
decides he can leave?

35:06.790 --> 35:10.636
I know what this is really
all about, Mr. McCoy.

35:12.295 --> 35:15.401
You're going after my
grandson to embarrass me.

35:15.932 --> 35:19.038
Yes! Personally,
professionally, publicly.

35:23.540 --> 35:27.920
I know your type. You think
that to bring down a man

35:27.977 --> 35:30.719
who's accomplished something
in life, it builds you up.

35:31.548 --> 35:33.550
You're not gonna
get away with it.

35:33.616 --> 35:35.596
I put a fair offer
on the table.

35:36.319 --> 35:40.768
You turn it down, I'll go
public and I'll expose you

35:40.824 --> 35:45.398
for the vindictive, envious
little man you really are.

35:48.598 --> 35:50.805
FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Anderton?
Can you give us a statement?

35:50.867 --> 35:53.575
MALE REPORTER: What were you talking to the D.A.
about, Mr. Anderton?

35:53.937 --> 35:56.213
Tell Mr. Anderton
we'll think about his offer.

35:56.373 --> 35:58.182
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

36:00.944 --> 36:03.515
I don't get it. Is he
waiting for a better offer?

36:03.913 --> 36:05.824
Is he setting us up
for an appeal?

36:06.649 --> 36:07.753
What did Skoda say?

36:08.385 --> 36:12.527
Charming one minute, aggressive and
paranoid the next. Sound familiar?

36:13.790 --> 36:17.169
Carl Anderton. Like
grandfather, like grandson?

36:18.895 --> 36:21.136
Maybe that's the
conclusion he's afraid of.

36:21.197 --> 36:23.404
Get everything you can on him.

36:25.802 --> 36:29.306
In 1951, he was taken out of Andover
in the middle of the school year.

36:30.573 --> 36:32.052
Got homesick.

36:32.108 --> 36:34.179
He finished out the rest of
the year at Austen Riggs,

36:34.244 --> 36:35.951
the Boy's Town
of the rich and famous.

36:36.279 --> 36:39.692
He spent the next two years
at home with tutors.

36:40.917 --> 36:42.954
Carl was always
high-spirited.

36:43.353 --> 36:45.026
This wasn't high spirits, Adam.

36:45.388 --> 36:47.925
I've tracked his press clippings
over the last 30 years.

36:47.991 --> 36:49.265
There are unexplained absences,

36:49.325 --> 36:50.861
or he checked himself
into a hospital,

36:50.927 --> 36:52.964
suffering from exhaustion.

36:53.029 --> 36:54.133
Next.

36:54.564 --> 36:57.875
Last April, he made a surprise take-over
bid for Commonwealth Airlines.

36:57.934 --> 36:59.504
One week later,
he withdrew the bid

36:59.569 --> 37:02.675
and accused the FAA and the
stockholders of conspiring against him.

37:03.273 --> 37:05.480
It's classic
manic-depressive behavior.

37:06.242 --> 37:10.281
Doesn't make sense.
Runs a Fortune 500 company.

37:10.380 --> 37:11.518
So did Howard Hughes.

37:11.581 --> 37:13.458
He could be fully functional,
if he's medicated.

37:14.817 --> 37:16.353
I don't want you to
humiliate him.

37:16.786 --> 37:20.461
He's standing between his own grandson
and an appropriate disposition.

37:21.191 --> 37:23.034
I want him to get
out of the way.

37:25.862 --> 37:28.866
Maybe his daughter
can talk some sense into him.

37:30.733 --> 37:32.406
My father loves my son.

37:32.702 --> 37:35.148
If Terry were sick, don't you
think he'd get him help?

37:35.438 --> 37:37.918
Unless he's afraid
it'd trace back to him.

37:38.007 --> 37:39.918
Trace what?
The mental illness.

37:40.343 --> 37:43.017
I told you, my father's
in perfect mental health.

37:43.079 --> 37:45.184
He's a public figure.
People would've noticed.

37:45.248 --> 37:46.818
Not if he's taking medication.

37:47.083 --> 37:49.029
JACK: And maybe they have
noticed, Mrs. Lawlor.

37:49.552 --> 37:51.862
Look at how
the media describes him.

37:51.921 --> 37:55.232
Colorful, eccentric,
mercurial, unpredictable.

37:55.725 --> 37:59.366
This is not a smear. To a
psychiatrist it's code for unstable.

37:59.729 --> 38:02.232
See for yourself.
Check his medicine cabinet.

38:02.298 --> 38:05.677
If he's taking Tegretol, Risperdal,
valproic acid, lithium...

38:06.569 --> 38:08.879
My father only takes
medication to help him sleep,

38:08.938 --> 38:10.383
to calm him down.

38:10.440 --> 38:11.783
His days are very stressful.

38:11.875 --> 38:14.685
Or to control his
unpredictable mood swings.

38:15.345 --> 38:17.586
Look, did your father tell you

38:17.647 --> 38:19.524
that he offered
to let Terry plead

38:19.582 --> 38:21.425
to Manslaughter
in the Second Degree?

38:22.218 --> 38:25.290
Our offer is, he pleads not guilty
by reason of mental disease,

38:25.355 --> 38:28.029
he goes to a psychiatric
facility instead of to prison.

38:33.696 --> 38:36.643
My father is Terry's guardian.

38:37.534 --> 38:39.605
I don't have
any authority. I can't...

38:44.774 --> 38:46.344
I don't know what to do.

38:55.218 --> 38:56.561
What are you doing here?

38:56.753 --> 38:58.255
Adam, what is this,
some kind of...

38:58.354 --> 39:02.325
I invited her, on the off-chance
that someone in your family

39:02.392 --> 39:04.565
would act in your
grandson's best interests.

39:04.861 --> 39:05.965
What's that supposed to mean?

39:06.029 --> 39:09.602
Mr. Anderton, let's just
find out what McCoy decided.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.440
You thought about our offer?

39:12.969 --> 39:14.039
(DOOR CLOSING)

39:16.039 --> 39:17.575
Man two?
Out of the question.

39:18.541 --> 39:23.149
The choice is man one or not guilty
by reason of mental disease.

39:23.246 --> 39:24.554
Back to that?

39:25.014 --> 39:27.016
When are you going to get it
through your thick skull.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.721
My grandson doesn't
belong in a hospital.

39:28.818 --> 39:31.025
Daddy, he does need help.

39:31.754 --> 39:33.233
You wait outside
until we're through.

39:33.690 --> 39:35.033
She's staying.

39:35.325 --> 39:36.804
Outside.
ELAINE: No.

39:40.864 --> 39:42.935
It doesn't matter what she thinks.
I'm his guardian.

39:42.999 --> 39:45.240
JACK: That can change,
Mr. Anderton.

39:46.102 --> 39:47.945
You've got to
agree to this, Carl.

39:48.004 --> 39:50.348
We're gonna petition
to have her appointed

39:50.406 --> 39:53.148
Guardian ad Litem
of your grandson.

39:53.543 --> 39:54.749
What? On what basis?

39:55.245 --> 39:56.485
Mental competency.

39:56.646 --> 39:57.681
Whose?

39:59.482 --> 40:00.586
Yours.

40:02.752 --> 40:05.358
We know about your stay
at Austen Riggs,

40:05.855 --> 40:07.926
the private tutors,
hospitals...

40:08.758 --> 40:10.795
It was exhaustion.
That's all.

40:10.860 --> 40:14.535
Once we start proceedings, issue
subpoenas, everyone'll know.

40:15.832 --> 40:17.038
I'm sorry, Carl.

40:18.401 --> 40:20.438
You trust these people over me?

40:21.471 --> 40:22.643
Huh?

40:24.574 --> 40:27.680
Oh, they finally got to
you, didn't they, Adam?

40:27.744 --> 40:31.157
After all these years,
you finally caved, huh?

40:32.715 --> 40:37.221
Ah, this thing,
this accusation...

40:37.320 --> 40:38.731
Don't you see
they've used it before,

40:38.788 --> 40:40.165
the newspapers, the networks...

40:40.356 --> 40:44.202
You've seen the hints, the way
Commonwealth tried to smear me.

40:45.228 --> 40:47.538
You know why? Because they
were always afraid of me.

40:48.798 --> 40:50.072
'Cause of my energy.

40:51.968 --> 40:54.312
It's the way I got things done!

40:55.571 --> 41:00.680
You let them do this,
it will never stop.

41:01.611 --> 41:07.289
Once it starts...
Starts! It never stops.

41:08.418 --> 41:09.897
And then...
It's okay.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.723
And then...
It's okay, Daddy.

41:12.922 --> 41:14.026
Adam,

41:15.825 --> 41:19.898
Adam, please, please, please, don't
let them do this to me. Please.

41:23.433 --> 41:24.639
Please.

41:31.307 --> 41:33.253
I remember thinking
that my step-sister

41:33.309 --> 41:34.913
had some kind of

41:36.112 --> 41:37.614
a demon inside her.

41:38.581 --> 41:39.821
JUDGE SIMONS: A demon?

41:42.085 --> 41:44.224
It had to do with why
my dad was an alcoholic.

41:46.155 --> 41:51.867
I had this idea that if I built a
fire, I could scare the demon away.

41:53.963 --> 42:00.380
I read in some book that Native Americans
use fire to purify the innocent.

42:02.405 --> 42:04.476
I just wanted my dad
to stop drinking.

42:07.176 --> 42:09.588
I wanted that
more than anything.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.817
Why didn't you tell
anyone you set the fire?

42:15.651 --> 42:16.823
I did.

42:18.021 --> 42:19.898
I told my grandfather
when I got home.

42:22.191 --> 42:24.193
He told me not to
talk about it.

42:25.761 --> 42:28.207
That he'd make sure that
I wouldn't get in trouble.

42:30.032 --> 42:31.375
JUDGE SIMONS: Mr. McCoy?

42:31.434 --> 42:32.606
(CLEARING THROAT)

42:34.170 --> 42:35.649
The People are satisfied,
Your Honor.

42:36.305 --> 42:37.716
Very well.

42:39.075 --> 42:45.117
Terence Lawlor, you're hereby
remanded to a secure facility

42:46.282 --> 42:50.094
to be designated by the Commissioner
of the Department of Mental Hygiene

42:50.586 --> 42:53.760
until such time as a panel
of doctors has determined

42:53.856 --> 42:57.497
you're no longer a danger
to yourself or to society.

42:57.894 --> 42:58.964
We're adjourned.

42:59.028 --> 43:00.166
(GAVEL POUNDS)

43:23.819 --> 43:25.264
Sorry about your friend.

43:26.055 --> 43:30.629
Save your sympathy. We haven't
heard the last of him.

43:32.094 --> 43:34.267
Living with that
secret all these years,

43:34.330 --> 43:36.469
it must have taken
enormous will power.

43:36.733 --> 43:38.838
Yeah.
Carl always had that.

43:39.201 --> 43:41.374
Whenever he did something bold,

43:41.437 --> 43:44.145
the Lindsay campaign,
take-over bids,

43:45.408 --> 43:51.415
the op-ed pundits would call him
crazy, and Carl would just smile.

43:56.185 --> 43:57.528
(CHUCKLES)

43:58.305 --> 44:04.585
