WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:08.718
Grimlock the Great,

00:08.742 --> 00:10.987
you have stolen my Magic Meteor,

00:11.011 --> 00:13.423
plundered my elderberry fields

00:13.447 --> 00:17.360
and crossed into my land
for the last time.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.728
Meet your fate,

00:18.752 --> 00:21.288
you son of a half-gnome.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.768
No!

00:24.792 --> 00:26.870
Mom! Mom!

00:26.894 --> 00:29.590
- What?!
- Internet's down again.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.399
What the hell is wrong now?

00:52.653 --> 00:54.678
Stone!

00:56.624 --> 00:58.392
Come on. Come on.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.606
- I got the jump on one.
- Huh?

01:02.630 --> 01:05.041
- Cuffed him to a pipe.
- What do these guys want?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.310
Maybe they're pissed
with their service, huh?

01:07.334 --> 01:09.203
Where's that backup?

01:10.971 --> 01:12.598
Now what?

02:00.054 --> 02:01.631
Don't bother, Tony.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.700
Cell towers are down, too.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.669
Don't need a cell tower
to play Bing Ball.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.971
Which is about all I'm
going to get done today.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.407
Who let you out of your cave?

02:10.431 --> 02:11.474
Dr. Mallard

02:11.498 --> 02:14.678
sent me up for a sit-rep.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.346
It's my first sit-rep.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.514
Lucky you.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.115
Well, the heat's out,
the phone's out,

02:19.139 --> 02:21.551
Internet's down, no elevator,
coffee or vending machines.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.219
Backup generators are feeding

02:23.243 --> 02:26.056
basic lights,
communications in MTAC.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.892
Oh, and autopsy freezers.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.493
Really?

02:30.517 --> 02:31.861
Yeah, that could get ugly, huh?

02:31.885 --> 02:33.463
So will Gibbs,

02:33.487 --> 02:35.298
if McGee and Ziva
don't get here pretty soon.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.533
Get here?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.468
You didn't hear?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.619
Tony, they never left
last night.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.542
You see this?
Nine hours, 21 minutes.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.897
Has it been that long?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.680
Why did you do that?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.399
It was either you or the watch.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.553
It's just, what's taking
so long, you know?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.221
Look, I'm sure
we're not the only ones

02:58.245 --> 03:00.090
who need to be rescued.
Plus, things could be

03:00.114 --> 03:01.691
- a lot worse.
- Yeah, how's that?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.893
Well, we could be stuck
here with Tony.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.161
I heard that.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.497
I find it very interesting
that the two of you

03:07.521 --> 03:09.165
left together late last night.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.734
Just ignore him.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.202
He's like an annoying bug.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.770
Eventually, he'll just go away.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.838
Ziva, it's been five years.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.039
Trust me,
he's not going anywhere.

03:16.063 --> 03:19.376
If you want, I can sing
a song for you guys.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.877
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.912
Rather have an update, Tony.

03:22.936 --> 03:26.583
There was an explosion
at a Potomac Electric substation

03:26.607 --> 03:28.575
causing some kind of...

03:29.810 --> 03:31.721
What is it?

03:31.745 --> 03:35.091
Begins with a "C,"
rhymes with "parade sailor."

03:35.115 --> 03:37.727
- Cascade failure?
- Cascade failure.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.295
God, you're good at this, McGee.

03:39.319 --> 03:41.364
So, that chain reaction
knocked out power

03:41.388 --> 03:42.632
in half the district.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.501
PEPCO says they'll have it
back online soon.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.069
Could not happen soon enough.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.138
I'm sure Gibbs
is feeling right at home.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.707
Well, you don't need electricity
to use hand tools

03:50.731 --> 03:52.266
or drink a bottle of bourbon.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.933
He's right behind you, isn't he?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.050
Yes, he is.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.786
Boss, you know
there's nothing wrong

04:02.810 --> 04:05.121
with the occasional cocktail.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.589
Grab your gear.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.992
Got a dead Navy lieutenant

04:09.016 --> 04:11.227
at an Internet provider.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.929
- So, we're still?
- Working?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.297
Yeah. Of course we are.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.799
I didn't mean to suggest

04:15.823 --> 04:17.333
that I wasn't planning
on being productive today.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.500
No go.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.527
Try patching the doors
to the backup generator.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.241
Oh, thank God.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.265
You're late, McGee.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.586
I must apologize
for our tardiness.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.888
Mr. Palmer
has trouble navigating

04:38.912 --> 04:40.623
when the streetlights
are working.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.259
It is not my fault.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.861
MapChart was down.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.464
And who do we have here?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.833
Navy Lieutenant Emma Paxton.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.222
And?

04:53.427 --> 04:56.005
Actually, that's all we have.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.341
NCIS servers are down, too.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.543
Local LEOs identified her

05:00.567 --> 05:02.312
by a credit card
found in her boot.

05:02.336 --> 05:06.349
And as to why a Naval officer
was taking part in the assault?

05:06.373 --> 05:08.341
Well, that is the million dollar
question, Ducky.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.021
I was doing rounds
when the alarm went off.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.225
Next thing we knew,
all hell broke loose.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.826
How many?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.661
Three, I think.

05:18.685 --> 05:19.796
Armed to the teeth.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.897
I tackled the woman.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.232
Was able to cuff her.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.366
She was wounded?

05:23.390 --> 05:25.001
No.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.070
She was fine when I left her.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.005
I... I think her friends
shot her.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.673
They did not want to risk

05:30.697 --> 05:32.308
leaving someone behind
who would talk.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.410
So... she's dead,

05:34.434 --> 05:35.945
'cause of me.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.814
Hey, it was either them or us.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.883
- What were they after?
- I don't know.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.585
Last I saw them,
they were heading into the farm.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.720
The farm?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.822
Yeah, kind of the brains
of the whole place.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.856
Real high security.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.258
Even we don't have access.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.093
Lucky for them,
the power went out,

05:50.117 --> 05:51.561
or I doubt they would
have made it inside.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.596
Mmm, maybe not so lucky.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.418
I will alert Potomac Electric.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.264
Boss,

06:28.288 --> 06:29.899
they call it the farm.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.901
As in the server farm.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.269
Connects the Internet

06:33.293 --> 06:34.904
to Internet users.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.106
Anything worth stealing?

06:37.130 --> 06:40.777
Yeah, millions in proprietary
trade secrets for one.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.046
We'll have to wait
till they do a full inventory

06:43.070 --> 06:44.298
to see what's missing.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.425
That's the iris scanner.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.260
Controls the magnetic seals.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.861
Lock's uncrackable.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.130
Yeah, so they blew the power.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.384
Looks like it.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.911
The camera.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.779
Left it to charge overnight.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.448
Obviously, it didn't.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.451
I can... I can run back
to the car,

07:21.475 --> 07:22.806
see if...

07:29.149 --> 07:31.761
Wouldn't happen to have any food
in there, would you, boss?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.184
Missed dinner last night.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.350
I'm going to pass.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.237
If I don't offer it,
then we don't share it.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.839
I understand completely.
Thank you for offering.

07:42.863 --> 07:46.009
Boss, I found tire tracks from
the getaway car in the alley.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.877
And an eyewitness
who can give us a sketch

07:47.901 --> 07:49.212
of one of the gunmen.

07:49.236 --> 07:52.081
I also alerted Potomac Electric

07:52.105 --> 07:53.616
for the possible
connection here.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.652
So, power's going
to be back on soon?

07:55.676 --> 07:56.653
Actually, they said the damage

07:56.677 --> 07:58.054
was a lot worse
than they thought.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.490
The chain reaction
has now spread to the entire

08:00.514 --> 08:01.624
tristate area.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.879
We may be without power
for days.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.364
So, how are we going to run
fingerprints through AFIS?

08:08.388 --> 08:09.632
Or facial recognition software?

08:09.656 --> 08:10.867
What is that?

08:10.891 --> 08:13.951
Or access our photos
from our digital cameras?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.037
Want to switch?

08:34.647 --> 08:35.924
Lieutenant Emma Paxton.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.227
According to her record,

08:38.251 --> 08:39.761
which I found in the annex

08:39.785 --> 08:42.164
misfiled in a box
with a rat trap stuck to it,

08:42.188 --> 08:44.600
she works for AFE.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.835
Armed Forces Entertainment.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.269
It's a DOD agency

08:47.293 --> 08:49.839
that, uh, sets up concerts
for military overseas.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.475
Yeah, Tim, I think he knows
what it is.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.610
She was a booking agent.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.945
What was she doing at SwiftCast?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.493
Appears to have been
robbing the place.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.534
You mean, why was she
robbing the place?

09:05.812 --> 09:09.043
Background does not shed
a lot of light.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.761
Has a squeaky clean record.

09:12.785 --> 09:13.786
Never saw combat.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.339
Married her
high school sweetheart,

09:23.363 --> 09:24.974
Anthony. Nice name.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.343
She's also an upstanding member
of her church.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.078
Sounds like a criminal
mastermind to me.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.546
What about the other two gunmen?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.981
Abby's working on the tire track

09:32.005 --> 09:33.816
we lifted from SwiftCast.
She wants to talk to you.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.809
I've got the gunman sketch
from our eyewitness.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.657
- DiNozzo, BOLO.
- On it.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.359
- McGee.
- Lieutenant Paxton's bank statements

09:43.383 --> 09:44.693
and credit card... on it.

09:44.717 --> 09:46.095
Ziva, I want to talk
to the husband.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.713
I will arrange it.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.369
Fax is dead.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.204
Phone is dead.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.661
Computer's dead.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.878
It's going to be a long case.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.781
What do you got?

10:05.805 --> 10:07.883
Better question is,
"What do you not got, Abbs?"

10:07.907 --> 10:09.685
And the better answer
would be a Caf-POW!

10:09.709 --> 10:11.654
I mean, I'm trying
to make my own here,

10:11.678 --> 10:13.022
but I'm missing, like,
400 ingredients.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.256
- You all right?
- No.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.658
I'm not okay, and I'm not going

10:15.682 --> 10:17.359
to be okay
until the power comes back on

10:17.383 --> 10:18.994
and I can run diagnostics
on my babies.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.062
These aren't like lightbulbs,
Gibbs.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.730
You can't turn them on and off.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.799
They're complex pieces
of machinery

10:23.823 --> 10:25.534
that require precise
shut-down sequences.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.969
I don't understand.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.371
I mean, why does Autopsy
get backup power and I don't?

10:29.395 --> 10:31.740
MTAC, I get that, but what does
Ducky have that I don't have?

10:31.764 --> 10:34.043
- Corpses.
- I'll get some corpses.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.578
Okay, I'm going
to start this again.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.079
What do you got?

10:37.103 --> 10:39.281
- Nothing.
- You called me down here to say you have nothing?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.250
- That's why I called you down here.
- To say you have nothing?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.052
Well, I have something.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.120
A tire track.
Tony brought the mold down.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.956
And my babies could I.D.
this thing in like two minutes,

10:46.980 --> 10:49.325
but at this point, I'm going to
have to do this by hand, Gibbs.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.460
By hand! I mean, do you
understand what that means?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.828
Maybe you know what that means,

10:52.852 --> 10:55.397
but I just need to know
that you know not to expect

10:55.421 --> 10:56.932
- my normal miracles.
- Yes.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.480
Great. I'll see you in an hour.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.293
No!

11:08.935 --> 11:10.446
No! No!

11:10.470 --> 11:12.448
So, this makes copies?

11:12.472 --> 11:13.916
I don't know.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.318
For some reason, I'm flashing
back to the fourth grade.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.853
There's no scanner.

11:17.877 --> 11:21.290
Sister Maryanne thought I was
cheating on my geology test.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.316
Well, maybe this is it.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.296
Hey, boss.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.497
Lieutenant, uh, Paxton's
husband's

11:28.521 --> 11:29.531
up at the conference room.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.200
I was just about
to come get you.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.603
We are still working
on distributing the BOLO sketch.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.904
E-mail's down.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.106
We found this in storage.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.941
We just need
to find a brontosaurus

11:38.965 --> 11:40.296
who knows how to use it.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.191
Boss, that was very impressive.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.807
McGee, did you get that?

12:08.528 --> 12:11.573
One of the men she was with.
It look familiar?

12:11.597 --> 12:13.976
"With"?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.811
What is that supposed to mean?

12:15.835 --> 12:17.564
My wife was a victim here.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.142
I'm sorry. I...

12:29.248 --> 12:31.375
I don't expect you
to understand.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.065
But you do,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.557
don't you?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.904
You want answers.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.328
I want my wife back.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.911
My wife was a proud American.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.612
Third-generation Navy.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.215
One of the good guys.

12:53.239 --> 12:56.018
There is one last thing

12:56.042 --> 12:58.101
I can do for her...

12:59.278 --> 13:03.158
I can bury her...

13:03.182 --> 13:07.129
with the full military honors
she deserves.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.245
Boss.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.909
Spoke to SwiftCast's CEO.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.711
They finished their inventory
of the farm

13:22.735 --> 13:24.747
and every other room
the gunmen were in.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.215
What did they grab?

13:26.239 --> 13:27.433
Nothing.

13:30.676 --> 13:34.612
So, why was his wife lying dead
on the floor?

13:43.823 --> 13:47.102
Hey, guys, look what I found.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.304
Look at this.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.306
What's the map for?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.974
What are you talking about?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.475
Can't have a corkboard
and no map.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.743
Haven't you ever seen Dragnet?

13:54.767 --> 13:55.811
No.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.700
Baretta?

13:59.239 --> 14:00.749
Kojak?

14:00.773 --> 14:02.918
Then this will mean nothing
to you.

14:02.942 --> 14:05.955
Who loves ya, baby?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.389
Right, boss?

14:07.413 --> 14:08.539
Telly on the telly?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.827
Sorry.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.429
So, what do we got, Ziva?

14:13.453 --> 14:15.064
A break-in at a facility

14:15.088 --> 14:17.166
with millions of dollars
worth of equipment,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.201
but nothing appears
to have been stolen.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.936
And nothing left behind.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.305
SwiftCast swept for bombs,
bugs, everything.

14:23.329 --> 14:24.506
Place is clean.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.809
Alarm was triggered
during the break-in.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.344
Maybe the gunmen split

14:28.368 --> 14:29.712
before they got
what they came for.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.080
We need to find
those missing gunmen.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.281
Still waiting on the BOLO,

14:32.305 --> 14:34.817
but, uh, our best lead
is Lieutenant Paxton.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.018
Talk to her CO.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.519
Okay.
Sorry about the Kojak, boss.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.288
Talking to her CO.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.024
Hey. Excuse me.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.259
Where do you think you're going?

14:43.283 --> 14:45.861
Uh, didn't you hear the boss?

14:45.885 --> 14:49.265
I'm going to go talk
to Lieutenant Paxton's CO.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.699
Then, who is going to go

14:50.723 --> 14:52.835
through her bank
and credit card statements?

14:52.859 --> 14:54.837
I figured, since that
was your area of expertise,

14:54.861 --> 14:56.505
you might look
through her credit cards

14:56.529 --> 14:57.840
and bank statements.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.332
I don't do hard copies.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.645
Then let's flip for it.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.347
Last time we flipped,
you used a trick coin.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.016
We'll use your coin.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.017
Fine.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.287
I flip, you call it in the air.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.989
If you touch me,
I automatically win,

15:14.013 --> 15:16.125
and...

15:16.149 --> 15:18.117
Sorry, McGee.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.702
Ah, Jethro.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.404
I was wondering
when you'd come down.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.972
Yeah, I've been busy, Duck.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.473
Yes, I imagine.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.242
I take it you noticed

15:33.266 --> 15:34.677
that the power has gone out?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.045
Yeah.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.846
Well, luckily for me,

15:37.870 --> 15:39.581
the main tool of my trade

15:39.605 --> 15:40.916
does not require electricity.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.251
- Observation.
- Yes.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.552
And what I have observed

15:43.576 --> 15:46.322
is two gunshots fired
at close range.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.857
Both tore through her heart.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.527
Yeah, they weren't taking
any chances that she'd talk.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.162
Oh, she still talks.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.165
And this contusion here
corroborates

15:56.189 --> 15:59.735
the security guard's story
of her capture.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.938
However, these handcuff bruises
are far too profound

16:02.962 --> 16:05.441
for her to have done them
herself.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.576
Gunmen tried to free her
before they killed her.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.746
Yes, which shows they did it
as a last resort.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.973
Which suggests a concern
for her welfare.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.119
Uh, go ahead.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.322
With the power out
in the rest of the building,

16:20.346 --> 16:23.338
I offered 107 to the staff.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.896
Anything else?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.566
Well, you know how I strive
for balance, Jethro.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.067
With two things

16:32.091 --> 16:33.869
that I can explain,
followed by two

16:33.893 --> 16:35.037
that I cannot.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.605
The first, this swelling

16:36.629 --> 16:37.740
of her extremities.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.641
Well, there are
medical conditions

16:39.665 --> 16:41.777
that would explain such edema,

16:41.801 --> 16:45.047
but the lieutenant
shows no anatomical

16:45.071 --> 16:47.249
indications
of having any of them.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.250
Blood work?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.419
Well, I sent it out to Abby.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.054
But with her mass spec down,

16:52.078 --> 16:55.275
I think it might be quite
some time before we get results.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.433
I was...

17:04.457 --> 17:05.651
just gonna...

17:10.029 --> 17:11.440
The second thing?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.442
I discovered extensive evidence

17:13.465 --> 17:16.011
of severe and widespread trauma:

17:16.035 --> 17:17.679
Broken bones,

17:17.703 --> 17:20.082
uh, stab wound scars,

17:20.106 --> 17:21.983
gunshot wounds.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.852
But according to her records...

17:23.876 --> 17:25.654
She's never been in combat.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.442
There's more to this woman
than meets the eye, Jethro.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.935
I can't believe it.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.970
I just can't believe
Emma's dead.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.306
When was the last time
you spoke to Lieutenant Paxton?

17:44.330 --> 17:46.408
I mean, yeah,
this is the military,

17:46.432 --> 17:47.709
but this is
the entertainment division.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.112
When people die here,
it's onstage.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.680
Just the facts, ma'am.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.683
Oh, I'm sorry. Um...

17:54.707 --> 17:59.021
we last spoke, uh,
three days ago.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.156
Before she was supposed
to leave for Baghdad?

18:01.180 --> 18:04.741
She wasn't going to Baghdad.

18:06.185 --> 18:09.922
We spoke
when she called in sick.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.516
Which is kind of how
I'm feeling right now.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.705
I'm sorry.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.574
I'm allergic to perfume,

18:18.598 --> 18:20.142
and you're wearing quite a bit.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.827
I'm not wearing any.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.819
I don't have any hot water.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.154
And it's not perfume.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.009
It's eau de cologne.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.359
Noted.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.194
How exactly do you have power?

18:39.218 --> 18:41.964
Uh, portable generators.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.600
We deploy them
for concerts overseas.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.702
Tony, if Lieutenant Paxton
was never supposed

18:46.726 --> 18:48.337
to go to Baghdad...

18:48.361 --> 18:50.606
She was lying to her husband.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.325
I know she was to me.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.045
She said she was really sick,

18:57.069 --> 18:58.947
she needed
to stay home a few days,

18:58.971 --> 19:02.818
but an hour later, I saw her
walking down 30th Street

19:02.842 --> 19:04.853
with a man.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.255
She didn't look sick at all.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.057
Did you get any descriptions?

19:09.081 --> 19:10.859
He was a male.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.009
A male man.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.555
Anything else?

19:16.822 --> 19:17.966
It's okay.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.356
Well, let's get crackin'.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.859
How did people survive
before search engines?

19:33.439 --> 19:34.750
Sorry, boss.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.765
I got another paper cut.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.227
- Keep them.
- Yeah. Thanks, boss.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.995
Almost done going
through these bank statements.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.078
- I promise.
- Uh-huh.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.339
Hey, Tony!

19:57.363 --> 19:59.975
Taking a little break,
are you, DiNozzo?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.577
I would very much like to.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.346
We were running down a lead
from Lieutenant Resnik's CO.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.948
More like walking down a lead.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.449
And walking.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.985
How did people survive
before e-mail?

20:10.009 --> 20:12.087
Needless to say,
it was a dead end.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.056
Is it possible for feet
to actually die

20:14.080 --> 20:15.657
when they're still connected
to your body?

20:15.681 --> 20:17.025
Think I've hit a dead end, too.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.760
Paxton's credit card

20:18.784 --> 20:20.195
and bank statements are clean.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.798
So, basically, we got nothing.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.032
Do blisters count?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.934
Then we have nothing.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.669
Speak for yourselves.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.137
I finally I.D.'d the tire tracks

20:29.161 --> 20:30.238
from the SwiftCast getaway car.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.140
I got the make and the model.

20:32.164 --> 20:36.111
And it only took me 72 times
longer than it usually does.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.780
How did people survive
before there was

20:38.804 --> 20:41.617
pattern-recognizing sparse
representation algorithms?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.485
Hey, did you get my batteries?

20:43.509 --> 20:46.121
Sorry. The entire city's
been de-Duracell'd.

20:46.145 --> 20:49.358
We are looking
for a Chevy Impala.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.293
Wait... a '99 Chevy Impala?

20:51.317 --> 20:52.995
I'm not sure of the year.

20:53.019 --> 20:53.996
Why?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.398
I've been jonesing
since our LlnX feed went down.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.133
I've been listening
to the police band all day...

20:58.157 --> 21:00.068
till my batteries died.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.504
Got a report here
of an abandoned car

21:02.528 --> 21:04.826
from Baltimore PD, boss.
It's a Chevy Impala.

21:18.911 --> 21:22.691
One of the SwiftCast guards
said he hit the rear window.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.945
Engine is cold.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.751
Boss.

21:29.755 --> 21:32.155
Looks like we got a blood trail.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.239
Clear.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.926
Wow.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.361
This is like the TARDIS.

21:59.385 --> 22:00.862
Tard what?

22:00.886 --> 22:02.798
It's a contraption

22:02.822 --> 22:04.700
that Doctor Who travels
through time in.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.368
Never mind.

22:06.392 --> 22:08.136
Doctor Who?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.218
Who watches that?

22:12.898 --> 22:13.942
This is more like Lord of War.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.712
Nic Cage movie
from a few years back.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.879
Packed with guns.

22:17.903 --> 22:20.449
"You
have the gun that Rambo use?"

22:20.473 --> 22:21.583
It's a good movie.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.452
Hey, boss.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.087
Take a look at this.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.888
It's our dead woman.
Multiple passports.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.824
Multiple identities.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.408
That's a regular
Jason Bourne identi-kit.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.010
Not exactly standard-issue

22:49.034 --> 22:51.146
for military's
entertainment division.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.681
I don't know... I heard showbiz
can be pretty rough.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.949
Perhaps that would explain

22:54.973 --> 22:57.685
why Lieutenant Paxton
has been moonlighting.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.321
Yeah, but moonlighting as what?

23:00.345 --> 23:02.056
Well, I've used sites
like this before.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.192
Mossad calls them sanctuaries.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.094
Each operative
maintains their own

23:06.118 --> 23:09.030
as a place to prepare
for their ops.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.166
What, you think Paxton
was running some kind of op?

23:11.190 --> 23:12.734
Well...

23:12.758 --> 23:15.069
I think...

23:15.093 --> 23:16.738
at this point,
we should be asking,

23:16.762 --> 23:18.195
who was she running it for?

23:19.431 --> 23:21.729
It's got its own generator.

23:23.035 --> 23:26.214
Think I might be able
to get us some answers.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.239
All right.

23:28.307 --> 23:29.551
Come on.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.810
Come on, baby, you can do it.

23:35.547 --> 23:36.925
Well, so much for answers.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.417
I think I just found us
a new question.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.647
They came here in this car.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.404
And then,
it looks like they left

23:49.428 --> 23:50.972
in a hurry in a second one.

23:50.996 --> 23:53.541
Hey, boss, I feel
like Davy Crockett...

23:53.565 --> 23:55.476
tracking them down.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.679
Got a second set of tracks.

23:57.703 --> 23:58.897
Abby's going to be thrilled.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.550
Hey, boss. We got something.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.886
Blueprints for SwiftCast.

24:04.910 --> 24:08.156
And the PEPCO substation
where the power was cut.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.658
Whatever the plan was,
looks like it was planned here.

24:10.682 --> 24:11.826
Husband's not
going to like hearing

24:11.850 --> 24:13.228
he was married to Mata Hari.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.763
He's not going to like
what else we found, either.

24:15.787 --> 24:19.848
His wife was not the only one
with a fake passport.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.277
You're recording this?

24:29.301 --> 24:30.979
We record all interrogations.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.914
Interrogation? You said you just

24:32.938 --> 24:34.115
had a few questions.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.629
I just have one.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.089
That's not mine.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.523
I've never seen that before

24:42.547 --> 24:44.259
- in my life.
- It's your picture.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.960
Yeah. Where'd you get it?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.862
Your wife had it.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.098
She kept a container
off of Route 50.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.522
Why would my wife...

25:07.739 --> 25:09.384
What do you want me to say?

25:09.408 --> 25:10.875
The truth.

25:15.213 --> 25:18.459
I told you before,
my wife is the victim here.

25:18.483 --> 25:20.781
You want answers?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.988
You're going to have
to give some.

25:28.894 --> 25:30.171
Okay, look.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.806
It's...

25:31.830 --> 25:34.175
Some things weren't adding up.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.243
How?

25:35.267 --> 25:36.778
Nothing I could put
my finger on.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.414
When you live with someone,
y-you just... you get a feeling.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.649
I didn't say anything before

25:41.673 --> 25:43.818
because I know Emma
was a good person,

25:43.842 --> 25:46.654
and damned if I was going to
give you help proving otherwise.

25:46.678 --> 25:48.256
But you still had doubts.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.058
I don't know what I had.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.515
I thought may...

25:53.552 --> 25:56.764
Maybe she could have been
cheating on me.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.232
But she wasn't.

25:58.256 --> 25:59.467
She wasn't doing anything wrong.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.735
And I can prove it.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.236
How?

26:02.260 --> 26:05.740
I hired a private investigator
to follow her.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.042
I have his tapes.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.500
You can see for yourself.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.949
Little more contrast
on the big screen, please.

26:14.973 --> 26:17.785
Little less.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.053
That is perfect.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.789
Hey.

26:21.813 --> 26:23.424
Need any help?

26:23.448 --> 26:25.159
No, I do not.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.261
You sure?

26:27.285 --> 26:30.365
I mean, technology's
not my thing, but...

26:30.389 --> 26:32.124
maybe I could be
your techno wingman.

26:35.026 --> 26:37.372
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.728
It means
that I've got it covered.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.444
So, I want you to go do

26:43.468 --> 26:45.771
whatever it is
that you were doing.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.496
What exactly
are you doing, again?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.453
I was hand-filing
evidence custody documents

26:52.477 --> 26:53.688
from the crime scene.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.523
Yeah. Have fun with that.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.216
I hope you blow a fuse.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.562
Generator can't last forever.

27:01.586 --> 27:03.789
Then, you'll be in the dark
with the rest of us.

27:14.499 --> 27:15.943
Hey, boss.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.945
- I was just...
- Just what?

27:17.969 --> 27:20.515
Rubbing it in?

27:20.539 --> 27:23.531
Because he left you
with the paperwork earlier?

27:24.576 --> 27:26.635
- Yeah.
- Huh.

27:27.779 --> 27:30.091
You found anything?

27:30.115 --> 27:31.959
Well, there's hours of video

27:31.983 --> 27:33.895
from the private investigator...

27:33.919 --> 27:35.563
Lieutenant Paxton at the park,

27:35.587 --> 27:36.898
getting a manicure, shopping.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.065
Nothing out of the ordinary.

27:38.089 --> 27:40.401
Just as her husband told us.

27:40.425 --> 27:41.903
You still think
he's covering for her?

27:41.927 --> 27:44.772
I think his wife's dead,
and he doesn't know why.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.874
I spoke to the P.I.

27:46.898 --> 27:48.676
He told him exactly
what he told us.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.634
Freeze it.

27:51.703 --> 27:54.482
Back it up.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.783
Whoa.

27:55.807 --> 27:56.951
There.

27:56.975 --> 27:58.486
Guy in the hat?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.922
That guy was in the street, too.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.380
Back it up.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.908
There.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.989
Different days.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.205
Someone else was following her.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.594
Who do you think it was?

28:19.631 --> 28:21.121
I don't know.

28:22.801 --> 28:24.946
There.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.147
We got his prints.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.582
Go pick 'em up.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.150
Right off that wall.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.352
Uh, you sure you wouldn't want
Tony or Ziva

28:31.376 --> 28:34.055
to maybe... if they want to...

28:34.079 --> 28:36.673
On it.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.443
Latent fingerprints
from the suspect in the park?

28:43.054 --> 28:44.398
- Check.
- Fingerprint cards

28:44.422 --> 28:46.701
from local LEOs matching
suspect's description?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.035
Check.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.136
Lemons?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.471
Did she say "lemons"?

28:50.495 --> 28:52.206
I hope not. Paper cut.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.808
But we can't start
without the lemons.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.076
Lemons, check!

28:55.100 --> 28:57.864
Though I still
do not understand.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.883
- Are we making cocktails?
- Now I'm the one

29:01.907 --> 29:02.917
flashing back
to the fourth grade.

29:02.941 --> 29:05.637
Mrs. Johnson's science fair.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.193
Oh, lemons!

29:12.217 --> 29:14.651
How could I miss that?

29:15.687 --> 29:17.498
Okay, people. It's showtime.

29:17.522 --> 29:19.233
Oh, yeah.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.701
So, careful...
I arranged these alphabetically

29:20.725 --> 29:22.590
so that they would all...

29:25.297 --> 29:28.676
DiNozzo, you're whorls.

29:28.700 --> 29:32.780
David, arches.

29:32.804 --> 29:36.083
McGee... loops.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.919
I'll take the composites.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.253
We'll use the bins

29:39.277 --> 29:40.588
to narrow down
the fingerprint cards,

29:40.612 --> 29:41.656
and hopefully find a match

29:41.680 --> 29:43.011
to the print from the park.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.052
Go.

30:04.102 --> 30:06.781
You never see this crap
on Columbo.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.575
Is it me, or does this
look like a squirrel?

30:12.043 --> 30:13.955
I would rather not answer that.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.209
Wait. Wait.

30:17.415 --> 30:18.726
I got it.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.894
I got a match.

30:19.918 --> 30:21.629
And it only took all night.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.932
Our camera-happy tourist's
name is...

30:24.956 --> 30:27.268
Donavan Graham.

30:27.292 --> 30:28.418
And he looks familiar.

30:32.364 --> 30:35.743
That is our gunman
from the break-in.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.678
Small-time hood,
used to sell guns,

30:37.702 --> 30:40.648
has a reputation
as a gun for hire.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.572
Well done.

31:04.629 --> 31:05.823
Boss.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.859
It's Graham.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.228
This must be the other gunman.

31:27.252 --> 31:29.117
His name is Leo Harper.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.235
Appears they were roommates.

31:34.259 --> 31:36.337
Until they shot each other.

31:36.361 --> 31:37.672
Commander Resnik.

31:37.696 --> 31:41.723
Agents DiNozzo, David.

31:43.935 --> 31:46.047
I'm impressed.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.615
So am I.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.150
Did you have
some kind of makeover?

31:49.174 --> 31:52.420
Despite my attempts
at diverting you, here you are.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.988
Hey. DiNozzo?

31:54.012 --> 31:57.591
That's Lieutenant Paxton's CO
at AFE.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.048
Not quite.

32:03.688 --> 32:05.499
National Security...

32:05.523 --> 32:07.081
Agency?

32:08.126 --> 32:09.904
Paxton and I were colleagues

32:09.928 --> 32:11.872
on a highly classified project.

32:11.896 --> 32:14.041
AFE was our cover.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.431
And this is much bigger
than you think.

32:26.377 --> 32:27.755
NSA had agreements

32:27.779 --> 32:29.857
with all major biometric
security companies

32:29.881 --> 32:32.827
to program a back door
into their iris scanners.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.328
- Boss, "back door" is...
- Yeah.

32:34.352 --> 32:35.863
Yeah, I know what it is, McGee.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.465
Paxton was one of two people

32:37.489 --> 32:39.467
whose irises were hard-coded

32:39.491 --> 32:40.768
into the devices.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.770
Like a... a master key.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.728
Who's the other?

32:51.770 --> 32:53.414
Wow, that is cool.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.884
Our eyes can open any lock
protected by any iris scanner.

32:56.908 --> 33:00.054
So, with AFE as your cover,
then you can...

33:00.078 --> 33:02.123
We can travel around the world
without suspicion,

33:02.147 --> 33:04.892
assisting other agencies
with covert activities.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.560
Like the SwiftCast break-in.

33:06.584 --> 33:10.631
We have no idea why Paxton
used her ability

33:10.655 --> 33:12.099
to break into SwiftCast

33:12.123 --> 33:14.101
or what she was trying
to accomplish.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.903
But clearly, our mission
has been compromised.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.239
Her husband?

33:18.263 --> 33:19.440
Maybe.

33:19.464 --> 33:20.908
But I wouldn't read too much

33:20.932 --> 33:22.476
into the fake passport.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.911
Lieutenant Paxton had it created

33:23.935 --> 33:26.180
in case her cover was blown
and they needed to disappear.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.015
But if she has gone rogue,

33:28.039 --> 33:30.618
there's no telling what damage
she might have done.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.287
Or was planning to.

33:33.311 --> 33:34.421
What are you thinking?

33:34.445 --> 33:37.458
Well, Paxton used her back door
to get into the farm,

33:37.482 --> 33:39.760
so that's not why
the power was knocked out.

33:39.784 --> 33:41.095
Why is it?

33:41.119 --> 33:42.630
That's why we're so concerned.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.265
Power's down.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.534
Communication's hobbled.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.537
Tactically, DC is in a very
vulnerable position right now.

33:49.561 --> 33:50.771
Yeah, we noticed.

33:50.795 --> 33:54.208
Well, we had hoped to get
to the bottom of this in-house.

33:54.232 --> 33:55.943
- Yeah, I bet.
- But you and your team

33:55.967 --> 33:58.612
seem to be making more progress
than we are.

33:58.636 --> 34:00.681
We need to pool our resources,

34:00.705 --> 34:02.750
find out what the endgame is.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.685
And fast.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.187
Talk to me, Duck.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.123
Do I sense increased urgency
in your step?

34:09.147 --> 34:11.257
- I need some answers.
- Those I have.

34:11.282 --> 34:14.128
Starting with whether these two
killed each other.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.429
They didn't.

34:15.453 --> 34:16.730
Crime scene was staged.

34:16.754 --> 34:19.466
Postmortem lividity suggests

34:19.489 --> 34:22.168
that both bodies were moved
after they were killed.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.338
Additionally,
though both victims

34:24.362 --> 34:26.005
were shot repeatedly
in the chest,

34:26.030 --> 34:27.842
these two were postmortem.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.744
The actual kill shots
were delivered from behind.

34:30.768 --> 34:34.047
I imagine their services
were no longer required.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.349
Tying up loose ends.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.083
The question is, who?

34:37.108 --> 34:40.154
Well, I don't know, Jim.
Do you have any ideas?

34:40.178 --> 34:42.188
No, sorry. And, uh...

34:42.213 --> 34:44.024
It-It was rhetorical.

34:44.047 --> 34:45.391
The, uh... Never mind.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.360
Well, I certainly have no idea

34:47.385 --> 34:50.030
who murdered these gentlemen,
but I can tell you

34:50.054 --> 34:52.132
how this one spent
his last hours.

34:52.156 --> 34:54.101
He was digging.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.904
Copious amounts of dirt
beneath his fingernails.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.596
Thanks, Duck.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.909
Left a couple agents digging
at Graham's place,

35:01.933 --> 35:03.377
but I'm pretty sure this
is what we're looking for.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.079
We found it under the shed
in the backyard.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.103
Open it.

35:11.075 --> 35:13.721
Oh, it's from the server
farm at SwiftCast.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.689
Except nothing
was reported stolen.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.291
And nothing
was supposedly left behind,

35:17.315 --> 35:18.525
but I think something was.

35:18.549 --> 35:20.060
The gunmen yanked
this thing out.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.196
And they put a duplicate
in its place.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.198
- That doesn't make sense.
- Think, McToma.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.233
It's a classic cop show
switcheroo.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.802
You take something at the target
location, and then you

35:28.826 --> 35:31.605
swap it with a, uh, bugged copy.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.207
Paxton was bugging the Internet.

35:33.231 --> 35:34.441
Can you do that?

35:34.465 --> 35:36.343
That would explain
why the power was cut.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.245
See, the only way
to swap the server

35:38.269 --> 35:39.580
without it being noticed

35:39.604 --> 35:41.015
would be when the system
was down.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.316
Which means the blackout

35:42.340 --> 35:44.885
is not a prelude
to a terrorist attack.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.553
Well, at least not the kind
that you're thinking of.

35:46.577 --> 35:48.822
No, this connects directly
to the Internet backbone.

35:48.846 --> 35:51.258
Every byte from every
government agency

35:51.282 --> 35:53.994
that uses the Internet
would be exposed.

35:54.018 --> 35:55.162
Which means?

35:55.186 --> 35:56.530
Our country's entire

35:56.554 --> 35:58.954
electronics infrastructure
would be at risk.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.671
She spent a lot
of time overseas.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.339
Imagine she met a lot of people
who would pay for the intel.

36:05.363 --> 36:07.508
I'm sure she did.

36:07.532 --> 36:10.433
But I don't think she
was the one trying to sell it.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.829
So, I finally finished running
Lieutenant Paxton's blood work.

36:18.443 --> 36:19.687
Smell anything?

36:19.711 --> 36:21.188
Whiskey.

36:21.212 --> 36:22.907
Good.

36:26.951 --> 36:29.763
It's nonalcoholic,
but I needed that.

36:29.787 --> 36:33.200
I have not manually distilled
this much plasma

36:33.224 --> 36:34.969
since the mass spec
in high school

36:34.993 --> 36:36.728
blew a Friedrich condenser.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.141
That's actually really funny,
if you have a PhD in chemistry.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.376
Abby.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.711
Um, okay.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.279
Uh, Paxton's blood work.

36:45.303 --> 36:49.216
She recently ingested massive
amounts of a vasodilator.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.985
It's prescribed
for high blood pressure.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.620
That explains the...
the swelling

36:53.644 --> 36:55.956
- that Ducky found.
- Suicide attempt?

36:55.980 --> 36:56.991
The drug is nonlethal,

36:57.015 --> 36:58.492
so that wouldn't be smart.

36:58.516 --> 37:01.528
I think that she was attempting
something way smarter.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.298
Tell me...

37:04.322 --> 37:06.200
what do you see?

37:06.224 --> 37:07.334
Your eyeball.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.236
Blood vessels, Gibbs.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.638
Every person
has a specific pattern.

37:11.662 --> 37:14.241
That's what allows
an iris scanner to identify you.

37:14.265 --> 37:16.176
Now, Paxton knew that.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.178
Commander Resnik said
that they are forbidden

37:18.202 --> 37:19.880
from taking any kind
of vasodilator,

37:19.904 --> 37:22.416
because of the effects it has
on the vessels in their eyes.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.751
Paxton tried to OD on one.

37:23.775 --> 37:27.354
I think she was hoping
to block her ability

37:27.378 --> 37:28.868
to unlock an iris scanner.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.659
She wasn't part of the break-in.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.048
She was trying to stop it.

37:37.221 --> 37:39.366
I identified her prints
at Graham's place,

37:39.390 --> 37:41.035
but only in the bathroom.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.536
So, I think that she
was kidnapped,

37:42.560 --> 37:44.538
and then the kidnapper
held her there.

37:44.562 --> 37:48.308
And she fought back
with the only thing available...

37:48.332 --> 37:50.577
what was in the kidnapper's
medicine cabinet.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.347
It didn't work,
but A-plus for the MacGyver.

37:53.371 --> 37:56.383
The label's peeled off,
but I know who this belongs to.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.119
I found traces of this drug
from a blood swab

37:59.143 --> 38:00.354
at the SwiftCast shoot-out.

38:00.378 --> 38:01.378
Who?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.431
Do you recognize him?

38:10.455 --> 38:12.132
I couldn't see the face,

38:12.156 --> 38:14.701
but I remember those eyes.

38:14.725 --> 38:16.737
I think he's the one
who shot me. Who is he?

38:16.761 --> 38:18.572
Lieutenant Paxton's husband.

38:18.596 --> 38:19.740
Husband?

38:19.764 --> 38:21.241
A real-life
Bonnie and Clyde, huh?

38:21.265 --> 38:23.392
You're sure that's him?

38:25.670 --> 38:28.082
Gibbs, we have
forensic evidence.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.349
Now we have an eyewitness.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.034
It think it's enough
to make the arrest.

38:32.343 --> 38:34.777
Just let me know
when you need me to testify.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.147
Nice timing.

38:44.021 --> 38:46.400
Wizards are playing tonight.

38:46.424 --> 38:48.268
Not a moment too soon.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.316
Enjoy your sandwich.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.796
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:15.820 --> 39:17.598
the story you are about to hear
is true.

39:17.622 --> 39:20.100
Only the names have been changed
to protect the innocent.

39:20.124 --> 39:21.668
Which is something you're not.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.770
You got a buyer yet
for all those zeros and ones?

39:23.794 --> 39:25.939
Getting shot during the break-in

39:25.963 --> 39:27.975
to divert suspicion
was a nice touch.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.510
Till it bit you in the ass.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.044
Had your blood
from the crime scene.

39:31.068 --> 39:34.381
You should really watch
your blood pressure.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.150
Next time you kidnap someone,

39:36.174 --> 39:37.851
keep them away
from your medicine cabinet.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.453
Book him, Dan-nozzo.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.388
Nice Hawaii Five-O
reference, boss.

39:41.412 --> 39:43.539
What are you looking at?

39:44.382 --> 39:46.393
Hey, McGee?

39:46.417 --> 39:48.362
Red-handed?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.684
Oh, they don't come much redder.

39:51.756 --> 39:53.280
Kill it.

40:00.198 --> 40:02.743
Who is he?

40:02.767 --> 40:04.878
Dimitri Verenikin.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.581
Used to work for Russian
counterintelligence,

40:07.605 --> 40:09.483
until two years ago.

40:09.507 --> 40:11.852
And then he decided
to freelance.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.487
We think he learned
about your wife

40:13.511 --> 40:16.089
while she was on an op in Kiev.

40:16.113 --> 40:18.525
And he found an asset
he could exploit.

40:18.549 --> 40:22.095
With the national security data
she gave him access to,

40:22.119 --> 40:24.431
he could name his price
to our enemies.

40:24.455 --> 40:26.667
Your wife tried to stop him.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.035
And when she couldn't,

40:28.059 --> 40:30.671
she cuffed herself
during the break-in.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.139
She knew we'd find her body.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.408
She knew we'd dig deeper.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.444
There's a lot I never knew about
Emma, but...

40:37.468 --> 40:41.715
one thing's for sure...
she was a fighter.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.263
Stubborn as hell.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.087
Yeah.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.089
Been there.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.091
Emma had to do it, right?

40:51.115 --> 40:52.526
She didn't have a choice.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.609
No, she had a choice.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.584
That's what makes her a hero.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.618
A hero.

41:06.931 --> 41:10.410
High-tech case,

41:10.434 --> 41:12.779
low-tech ass-kicking.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.363
Kind of ironic.

41:17.408 --> 41:21.788
You know, I actually
kind of enjoy being unplugged.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.824
Eh, gives you time to think.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.125
Slow down.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.027
No e-mails to return.

41:27.051 --> 41:28.245
No spam.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.331
It's nice.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.824
Hey!

41:40.631 --> 41:42.428
It's alive!
