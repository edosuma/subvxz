[NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon
Ball, Oolong may have saved the

world from Emperor Pilaf,
but now that Goku has caught

01:58.209 --> 02:00.875
a glimpse of the full moon, he
and the rest of the gang have

02:41.125 --> 02:42.709
We better make a break for it!

02:42.792 --> 02:44.500
This whole place

02:52.834 --> 02:55.167

03:57.625 --> 03:59.500

What's wrong with this thing?

04:21.041 --> 04:22.250
Why won't it start?!

04:22.334 --> 04:24.500
Maybe because you're
not yelling loud enough?

04:32.584 --> 04:34.542
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

04:34.625 --> 04:36.292

05:32.334 --> 05:33.250
Hey, Don Juan!

05:33.334 --> 05:35.500
Can't you see I

I-I'm sorry,
I just... can't.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.334

I just can't bear to watch
my castle being destroyed

06:18.542 --> 06:20.959
like this! My
insurance premiums

06:21.042 --> 06:22.792
are gonna go
through the roof...

06:22.875 --> 06:23.834
Turn around!

[MAI and SHU] Huh?!

06:24.625 --> 06:26.459
You heard me! Go back!

06:26.542 --> 06:29.584
We're going to beat that big

this plane up its nose!

06:30.917 --> 06:32.375
Oh, but, Emperor!

06:32.459 --> 06:33.875
Don't you want
to reconsider, sir?

06:34.209 --> 06:36.209
[PILAF] Where's
the eject button?!

06:36.292 --> 06:37.042
You're getting out!

06:44.084 --> 06:47.042
I did it!
I... I did it!

06:47.125 --> 06:49.084
I can't... believe...
I... did it

06:50.750 --> 06:52.167
Well, I can...

06:53.209 --> 06:55.875
Thanks for playing my
knight in shining armor...

07:04.500 --> 07:06.709
I can't believe I
actually touched a girl...

07:06.792 --> 07:08.167
And I'm still all right!

07:14.167 --> 07:16.042
Die! Die!

07:20.459 --> 07:21.834
Goku!

07:25.959 --> 07:27.292
Oh no!

07:27.375 --> 07:29.917
So he's a big hairy ape! That's
no reason to shoot him!

07:30.000 --> 07:32.375
Eat lead, you big baboon!

08:01.917 --> 08:04.459
Why, our puny gun
is totally useless!

08:04.542 --> 08:06.584
Now I just think we
made him really mad!

08:07.125 --> 08:09.750
All right then, it's
time we played our trump card...

08:09.834 --> 08:12.417
Fire the heat-seeking missile!

08:12.500 --> 08:13.875
Right!

08:16.209 --> 08:17.834
[MAI] Easy, big boy...

08:18.167 --> 08:19.000
That's it!

08:19.084 --> 08:19.667
Locked on target...

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

08:46.875 --> 08:49.667
I did it! It worked!
I killed him!

08:52.750 --> 08:54.834
Is... Is Goku dead?

08:56.667 --> 08:57.959
Oh, Goku...

09:11.584 --> 09:14.000
[PILAF] Like I always say: 'The
bigger they are, the harder they

09:14.084 --> 09:17.250
fall'! That'll teach
him not to monkey with me!

09:17.709 --> 09:19.750
Wow, he sure is huge!

09:19.834 --> 09:21.000
and smelly...

09:21.084 --> 09:23.000
More importantly,
why did he have to go and

09:23.084 --> 09:25.417
wreck my castle? Just my luck!

09:28.125 --> 09:32.334
It took me ten years
to build that castle...

09:32.417 --> 09:35.959
and now it's gone! Gone!

09:36.709 --> 09:41.250
[PILAF] I hate you,
you... You overgrown ape!

09:43.375 --> 09:45.542
It's gone!
Gone! Gone! Gone!

No kidding! Too close!

10:50.750 --> 10:54.167
[APE GOKU roaring]

10:54.250 --> 10:56.375
I guess we'd better
hide out 'til morning

10:56.459 --> 10:57.667
when the moon goes down...

10:59.000 --> 11:00.209
Uhh, let's go that way!

12:09.334 --> 12:11.250
Yamcha, didn't you
say that Goku's weak

12:11.334 --> 12:13.167
point is his tail?

[GOKU snoring]

14:07.834 --> 14:10.000
[PILAF] So that little
kid caused all of this?

14:10.084 --> 14:11.625
Why didn't one of
you morons kill him

14:11.709 --> 14:13.209
when you had the chance?

14:13.292 --> 14:15.709
[SHU] You wanted to
let them bake, sire!

14:15.792 --> 14:16.750
[PILAF] Oh yeah...

14:16.834 --> 14:18.167
But this is
still all your fault!

14:18.250 --> 14:19.125
Is that clear?

14:19.209 --> 14:20.292
[MAI and SHU] Yes, sire...

14:20.375 --> 14:21.834
[PILAF] My poor castle!

14:36.625 --> 14:38.292
[PILAF] Here... and here.

14:38.375 --> 14:41.417
Now, listen
carefully, you two.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.250
My Great-Granddaddy Pilaf
used to say there's no

14:44.334 --> 14:46.667
sense crying over your
losses until you've gotten

14:46.750 --> 14:49.334
your revenge. So, let's
get our revenge and let

14:49.417 --> 14:51.459
the crying begin!

14:51.959 --> 14:53.750
Wow, what a guy!

14:53.834 --> 14:56.834
Yeah, he must've
been quite an inspiration.

14:57.542 --> 14:58.542
[PILAF] All right!

14:58.625 --> 15:00.042
Now let's get

[MAI and SHU] Huh?!

15:07.334 --> 15:09.042
Hey, Emperor Pilaf!

15:09.125 --> 15:11.084
Where are you going, sire?

15:11.167 --> 15:12.917
Never mind me, you fools!

15:13.000 --> 15:17.834
Just get those pesky kids! And
remember the ageless words of

15:17.917 --> 15:19.917
my dear Great-Granddaddy Pilaf!

15:22.459 --> 15:24.209
[MAI and SHU] Wait up!

15:46.375 --> 15:50.209
[GOKU snoring]

15:50.292 --> 15:52.125
That was quite a
predicament that Goku

15:52.209 --> 15:54.125
managed to
get us into, huh?

15:54.209 --> 15:56.084
Yeah, but if he hadn't
changed into that monster

15:56.167 --> 15:59.167
we would have all been
barbecued in Pilaf's cell!

15:59.250 --> 16:01.292
We'd better not tell
him that he stomped his

16:01.375 --> 16:05.042
grandpa to death... It would
just break his little heart.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.209
Did you guys know a
terrible monster comes out

16:08.292 --> 16:09.834
when the moon is full?

16:09.917 --> 16:11.875
But I'm not
making it up, Bulma!

16:11.959 --> 16:15.375
My Grandpa was trampled to
death by that horrible monster.

16:17.292 --> 16:20.917
Oh... It's just
so hard to believe...

16:21.000 --> 16:24.417
So what's the deal?
Is Goku some kind of alien?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.292
He looks normal enough...

16:26.625 --> 16:28.750
I have a feeling he'll
be quite normal now

16:28.834 --> 16:31.042
that his tail's been cut off.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.417
[BULMA] I sure hope so.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.875
I've got enough friends
with weird hang-ups already!

16:34.959 --> 16:37.459
Not mentioning any
names, of course...

16:39.084 --> 16:40.667
Oh boy, he's waking up!

16:41.334 --> 16:44.042
[GOKU yawning]

16:44.125 --> 16:44.709
Goodness!

16:45.084 --> 16:46.209
Good morning, kid.

16:46.292 --> 16:47.500
Hi!

16:48.500 --> 16:51.375
So, feeling light-hearted
this morning, are we?

16:51.459 --> 16:52.834
Yeah!

16:53.292 --> 16:55.292
[GOKU] My-My clothes are gone!

16:55.375 --> 16:57.584
You don't remember
anything, do you, Goku?

16:57.959 --> 16:59.334
Huh?

16:59.667 --> 17:00.667
How about
sharing some of your

17:00.750 --> 17:02.959
clothes with Goku, Oolong?

17:03.042 --> 17:04.459
Anything but my
undies, made of the

17:04.541 --> 17:08.000
finest cotton in the universe,
and supremely comfortable!

17:08.084 --> 17:09.459
Oolong!

17:10.416 --> 17:13.375
Well, all right then,
he can borrow my pants.

17:13.459 --> 17:17.250
[PUAR snoring]

17:17.334 --> 17:18.875
[OOLONG] Check him out!
Now that's a

17:18.959 --> 17:21.500
definite improvement!
That's style!

17:21.584 --> 17:24.084
Your legs are a lot
shorter than mine are.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.584
Hey! What's with
the wise-crack, huh?!

17:26.666 --> 17:28.291
Uh? W-Wuh--?

17:28.375 --> 17:30.584
Uh, didn't mean to
frighten you there, kid.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.459
You didn't.
I just can't seem to stand up!

17:33.542 --> 17:35.459
That's not too surprising.
You probably just

17:35.542 --> 17:36.917
need to spend a
little time learning

17:37.000 --> 17:38.709
how to balance
without your tail.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.500
Why would I
wanna do that?

17:40.584 --> 17:44.042
Wha--? Oh, no way!

17:44.125 --> 17:45.625
My tail's gone you guys!

17:46.459 --> 17:47.792
[GOKU] Oh, where
could it have gone?

17:47.875 --> 17:49.000
I can't believe it!

17:49.084 --> 17:50.584
It's really gone you guys!

17:50.667 --> 17:52.042
I'm sure it was
there last night!

17:52.125 --> 17:55.125
It's just disappeared!
Vanished! I don't know!

17:55.500 --> 17:57.709
Guess I should wait
for it to come back...

18:00.250 --> 18:03.042
You are one strange,
little kid, Goku.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.917
[GOKU] Where's my...
uh... Power Pole?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.084
Oh, it's that way...
Where the castle used to be.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.667
[GOKU] It's demolished!

18:11.250 --> 18:14.334
I sure hope... my Power Pole's
still out here!

18:14.417 --> 18:16.375
Wah! Ow...

18:17.459 --> 18:18.709
Wah!

18:18.792 --> 18:20.667
What are we gonna do now?
We can't look for the

18:20.750 --> 18:24.084
Dragon Balls for a whole
year, so... I guess we

18:24.167 --> 18:25.750
should just go our
separate ways, huh?

18:26.125 --> 18:28.792
Well, yeah, that seems
like the thing to do.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.750
Hey, it's time to wake up,
my furry, little friend.

18:33.417 --> 18:35.917
[BULMA] Oh well. I guess it's
going to be a whole year before

18:36.000 --> 18:39.209
I can have my wish
granted for a new boyfriend...

18:39.750 --> 18:42.209
[YAMCHA] So, I've got to
spend another year acting like

18:42.292 --> 18:45.334
a lunk-head everytime a
pretty girl comes around...

18:45.417 --> 18:47.042
[YAMCHA] I'll never
get a girlfriend!

18:47.792 --> 18:49.167
[BULMA sighs]

18:50.000 --> 18:51.500
[YAMCHA] Hmm!

18:51.584 --> 18:52.959
--Hm?
--Huh?

18:53.834 --> 18:56.167
[GOKU laughing]

18:56.250 --> 18:57.625
Ugh!

18:58.167 --> 19:00.250
[GOKU] Hey Oolong, I found it!

19:01.167 --> 19:03.417
Is there something
bugging you, Oolong?

19:03.500 --> 19:05.792
Yeah, get a load of
Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee!

19:06.292 --> 19:12.542
[laughing]

19:12.625 --> 19:14.709
It looks like
they're hearing music...

19:14.792 --> 19:16.542
Boy, that's sure weird...

19:17.542 --> 19:18.750
Ooh!

19:18.834 --> 19:21.875
Uh! Oh no! Did I hurt you,
Bulma? Let me see...

19:21.959 --> 19:24.834
[BULMA] Yeah, a
little, but it's okay...

19:24.917 --> 19:26.750
I feel fine now...

19:28.167 --> 19:30.167
[BULMA] You saved
my life, remember?

19:31.542 --> 19:32.709
Uhm, ahem!

19:32.792 --> 19:35.250
I don't mean to
interrupt you guys, but um...

19:35.959 --> 19:37.542
[YAMCHA laughing]

19:37.625 --> 19:39.875
I think Yamcha and I've
decided that we'd like to

19:39.959 --> 19:41.459
spend a little
more time together...

19:41.542 --> 19:42.917
[YAMCHA laughing]

19:43.000 --> 19:45.542
So, why don't we all
go back to the city?

19:45.625 --> 19:46.959
Pretty cool idea, huh?

19:47.042 --> 19:48.875
That sounds good.
But I think I'm gonna go to

19:48.959 --> 19:51.250
Master Roshi's and
train like my Grandpa did.

19:51.334 --> 19:52.959
I wanna get strong!

19:53.042 --> 19:55.417
But Goku, you're the
strongest kid I know...

19:55.500 --> 19:58.709
Yeah, but when I hit that
castle it didn't even shake!

19:58.792 --> 20:01.042
So if someone else can come
along and tear the whole

20:01.125 --> 20:03.584
thing down, I really
need to go and train!

20:03.667 --> 20:05.167
What are you
talking about, Goku?

20:05.250 --> 20:07.959
You're the one
who destr-mmmph!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.500
We'll miss you, Goku...

20:11.584 --> 20:13.084
And what about you, Oolong?

20:13.167 --> 20:14.250
Well, I dunno.

20:14.334 --> 20:16.459
Do you think I look
like a big city pig?

20:16.542 --> 20:19.625
Are you kidding?
You'll be the talk of the town!

20:19.709 --> 20:21.667
Especially with that
underwear on your head!

20:21.750 --> 20:24.500
You're just jealous 'coz I
got these from the dragon!

20:24.584 --> 20:27.167
[laughing]

20:27.250 --> 20:29.334
Oh well,
I guess I'll go...

20:29.417 --> 20:30.875
You guys need me!

20:30.959 --> 20:32.459
I know!

20:32.542 --> 20:34.417
When a year goes by, let's go
look for the Dragon Balls again!

20:34.959 --> 20:37.417
[BULMA] We don't need the
Dragon Balls anymore, Goku!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.334
[laughter]

20:39.417 --> 20:41.417
[OOLONG spitting]

20:41.792 --> 20:43.167
Despicable!

20:43.625 --> 20:46.250
Hey, how will I ever be
able to find my Grandpa's Dragon

20:46.334 --> 20:49.542
Ball if you're not there
with your radar, Bulma?

20:49.625 --> 20:51.250
Well, I'll tell you what, kid.

20:51.334 --> 20:54.209
How about I just give you this
radar as a going away present,

20:54.292 --> 20:57.375
to remind you of all the good
times that we had together.

20:57.459 --> 20:58.750
Oh wow, thank you.

21:09.459 --> 21:11.459
Well, here goes.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.209
[YAMCHA] I guess this
is goodbye, Goku...

21:18.292 --> 21:21.584
I want you to become just as
strong as Master Roshi, okay?

21:21.667 --> 21:22.709
Okay.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.542
You know I'll never
forget you, Goku.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.292
Aww.

21:27.209 --> 21:28.667
Flying Nimbus!

21:30.084 --> 21:31.459
Hey-hey!

21:34.209 --> 21:37.084
All right, Nimbus, to
Master Roshi's, and step on it!

21:38.334 --> 21:39.750
You go get 'em, kid!

21:39.834 --> 21:41.042
You too, Oolong!

21:41.459 --> 21:42.709
[YAMCHA] Hold on, everyone!

21:52.500 --> 21:57.042
[GOKU laughing]

21:57.125 --> 21:58.417
[GOKU] Yeah!

21:58.500 --> 21:59.542
[GOKU laughing]

21:59.625 --> 22:01.000
[ALL] Buh-bye!

22:02.459 --> 22:03.834
[GOKU] Bye! See ya!

22:06.792 --> 22:10.667
I never thought that life
could be such a neat adventure!

22:10.750 --> 22:12.459
[GOKU laughing]

22:12.542 --> 22:13.750
Go!

22:15.375 --> 22:17.792
[NARRATOR] Soon, Goku's skills
will be put to the test when he

22:17.875 --> 22:21.375
joins Master Roshi and begins
the rigors of Turtle Hermit

22:21.459 --> 22:25.334
Training! But what other
challenges await our young hero?

22:25.417 --> 22:28.500
[NARRATOR] A new day dawns,
and a new adventure begins,

22:28.584 --> 22:30.834
next time on Dragon Ball!
