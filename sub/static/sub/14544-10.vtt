01:42.261 --> 01:44.002
Have you had time to talk?

01:44.096 --> 01:45.700
We met at the hospital.

01:45.798 --> 01:47.641
Did you get anywhere?

01:47.733 --> 01:49.371
No.

01:49.469 --> 01:51.915
Didn't you say anything or what?

01:52.004 --> 01:54.507
We said things, but we didn't talk.

01:54.607 --> 01:57.486
We say things, and that's nice.

01:57.577 --> 01:58.612
Nice is good.

01:58.711 --> 02:01.123
He missed the house, but not me.

02:01.214 --> 02:04.195
He's passionate about roof tiles!

02:04.283 --> 02:07.628
Daddy loves you so much.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.030
So much that he almost died, in fact.

02:10.122 --> 02:13.194
I'm not getting any younger.
I want to live.

02:18.631 --> 02:22.408
What in the hell is that?

02:22.502 --> 02:24.573
Are you showing me a dating site?

02:24.670 --> 02:26.581
Pretty good-looking, aren't they?

02:26.672 --> 02:29.050
They all look just like Dad.

02:29.141 --> 02:30.415
No, they don't.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.922
They do! Look at them.

02:33.012 --> 02:35.583
Two of them are captains.

02:35.681 --> 02:37.422
And this one works
at the Maritime Association.

02:37.517 --> 02:41.363
- I guess I have a thing for sailors.
- This is not happening.

02:41.454 --> 02:44.924
But none of them
has a summer house.

02:46.659 --> 02:49.765
Is that the issue?
The house?

02:49.880 --> 02:52.080
HOME

04:30.062 --> 04:32.235
There you go, Daddy.

04:32.331 --> 04:36.279
Back at your beloved
summer house.

04:36.369 --> 04:38.849
Are you comfortable?

04:38.938 --> 04:39.916
Can you smell that, Dad?

04:40.006 --> 04:46.048
The fresh air, the birds, the sea,
the bushes over there?

04:46.145 --> 04:48.819
This place is good for you.
It is so nice here.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.690
The city is nice, too.
Right, Gustaf?

04:51.784 --> 04:53.923
Not really.

04:54.020 --> 04:58.560
Here you can spend time on the house
now that you are single.

04:58.658 --> 05:00.865
Don't worry about the house, Daddy.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.462
He isn't single.

05:02.561 --> 05:05.007
They haven't separated.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.633
It's just a little break, right?

05:07.466 --> 05:10.106
Still, a break is a fake.

05:11.037 --> 05:13.643
This is perfect for you.
The same routine.

05:13.739 --> 05:15.776
Day after day.
Just how you like it.

05:15.875 --> 05:19.345
- Gustaf, can we talk for a second?
- This is a dream come true, Dad.

05:19.445 --> 05:22.915
It doesn't get any better than this.
Most people on earth would...

05:25.551 --> 05:28.122
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

05:28.220 --> 05:31.133
You're pitching the house
like a real-estate broker.

05:31.223 --> 05:33.533
Mom hates this house, Gustaf.

05:33.626 --> 05:34.798
So?

05:34.894 --> 05:37.704
So if we want to get them
back together,

05:37.797 --> 05:41.643
don't encourage Dad to be here.

05:41.734 --> 05:44.010
Are we sure we want that?

05:44.103 --> 05:45.138
What?

05:45.237 --> 05:46.841
For them to get back together?

05:46.939 --> 05:49.783
Yes. What's wrong with you?

05:49.875 --> 05:50.876
I'm not stupid.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.718
If they divorce,
we get two birthdays,

05:53.813 --> 05:56.089
two Easter baskets,
two allowances...

05:56.182 --> 05:58.128
What are you, 12?

05:58.217 --> 06:00.527
- 28 and a half.
- I know, Gustaf!

06:00.619 --> 06:01.859
Listen.

06:01.954 --> 06:07.404
Mom has let you live at home
so she wouldn't be alone with Dad.

06:07.493 --> 06:11.635
If Mom starts dating,
you think she wants you there?

06:11.731 --> 06:13.176
No, I don't think so.

06:13.265 --> 06:14.938
You will end up living with him.

06:15.034 --> 06:17.514
Do you want that? No.

06:17.603 --> 06:22.814
You will have to get an apartment,
pay rent, and wash your own clothes.

06:22.908 --> 06:24.945
Oh, no.

06:25.044 --> 06:27.718
What the hell are we going to do?

08:22.795 --> 08:24.297
We have to talk about something.

08:26.031 --> 08:27.101
Okay.

08:27.199 --> 08:29.270
Do you want Mom back?

08:29.368 --> 08:30.745
Yes.

08:30.836 --> 08:33.282
Then you have to make
some sacrifices.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.549
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.644
Can you sell the house?

08:38.744 --> 08:39.882
No.

08:42.348 --> 08:44.954
Mom doesn't like it here.

08:45.050 --> 08:48.156
Why don't you
travel somewhere together?

08:48.254 --> 08:53.431
We took the car to Yugoslavia
in our first summer.

08:53.525 --> 08:57.598
Yes, but that country
doesn't exist anymore.

08:57.696 --> 08:59.437
No.

08:59.531 --> 09:01.135
It's a tragedy.

09:04.737 --> 09:11.154
I thought that it was meant
to be forever, the two of us.

09:11.243 --> 09:13.621
It can still be like that.

09:13.712 --> 09:16.522
Just make her
fall in love with you again.

09:16.615 --> 09:18.788
Do you remember
what made her fall in love?

09:20.653 --> 09:22.155
Yes.

11:18.404 --> 11:20.111
Here we come!

11:25.377 --> 11:27.618
The uniform is too small.

11:27.713 --> 11:28.783
That's mean.

11:28.881 --> 11:31.418
We were supposed to have
an open mind.

11:31.517 --> 11:34.555
Not roll our eyes and sigh.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.826
We must be able to talk about this.

11:36.922 --> 11:39.402
You've lived together for 35 years.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.300
You can't separate
without talking it through.

11:41.393 --> 11:43.270
So do that. Good luck.

11:53.305 --> 11:54.682
How are they doing?

11:54.773 --> 11:57.253
At least they're talking.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.090
What's this?

12:02.181 --> 12:03.888
"The Survivors."

12:03.982 --> 12:06.758
A therapy group for lonely people.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.593
This might be good for Dad.

12:08.687 --> 12:13.136
Is there a group for little brothers
who are complete morons?

12:13.225 --> 12:16.763
We're trying to get them
back together.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.603
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

12:18.697 --> 12:22.474
I bet 20 crowns they won't make it.

12:22.568 --> 12:25.845
Listen. I think he's laughing.

12:26.805 --> 12:28.250
I think he's crying.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.944
Stop it.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.757
Mom, why is Birger crying?

13:34.907 --> 13:37.217
Hi, I'm Gunilla.

13:37.309 --> 13:39.289
Thanks to this group,

13:39.378 --> 13:42.552
I've been able to cope
with being alone.

13:42.648 --> 13:46.221
Thank you all
for being there for me.

13:46.318 --> 13:48.798
Thank you, Gunilla.

13:48.887 --> 13:50.093
Okay, next?

13:51.590 --> 13:52.967
Hi.

13:53.058 --> 13:54.969
I'm Birger.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.563
- Hi, Birger.
- Hi.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.510
When did this happen?

14:00.599 --> 14:03.944
Just a few days ago.

14:04.036 --> 14:06.380
It's all my fault.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.146
No. Don't blame yourself, Birger.

14:10.242 --> 14:15.191
What's important now is being able
to talk about what happened.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.953
Was it a disease?

14:17.049 --> 14:18.722
It might have been.

14:20.185 --> 14:24.065
Perhaps some sort
of temporary insanity.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.201
Okay.

14:27.292 --> 14:29.966
So she committed...

14:30.062 --> 14:32.303
A mistake.

14:32.397 --> 14:36.903
I hope she knows
that she made a terrible mistake.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.844
May I ask, how did your wife die?

14:46.144 --> 14:49.648
- Is she dead?
- Get it together. She isn't dead.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.388
Birger...

14:54.486 --> 14:58.161
this is a group
for widows and widowers.

14:59.791 --> 15:02.601
Are you a widower, Birger?

15:05.464 --> 15:07.307
Well...

15:16.174 --> 15:19.712
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I feel violated.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.950
I'm sorry.
I had no idea...

15:24.716 --> 15:26.718
Everybody makes mistakes.

15:26.818 --> 15:34.794
But you must know that everyone here
has lost their loved one forever.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.201
I said I was sorry.

15:36.295 --> 15:38.172
But your wife is alive.

15:38.263 --> 15:40.106
Do you see the difference?

15:40.198 --> 15:44.874
Whatever issues you have,
you can fix them.

15:44.970 --> 15:46.540
I'm certain.

15:46.638 --> 15:50.848
You have an opportunity
that everybody here wishes they had.

15:50.942 --> 15:52.922
As long as there is life,
there is hope.

15:53.011 --> 15:55.218
Do something about it.

16:04.122 --> 16:05.931
- Yes?
- I'm...

16:06.024 --> 16:08.937
My name is... Jean-Luc.

16:09.027 --> 16:10.870
Hi, Jean-Luc.

16:36.488 --> 16:38.399
Where is he?

16:38.490 --> 16:41.471
- I have to go to New York.
- That's in America.

16:41.560 --> 16:45.064
This is stupid.
Damn those birds...

16:45.163 --> 16:46.733
I can't stand it here.
Let's go.

16:46.832 --> 16:49.745
Mom, give it one minute.

16:49.835 --> 16:52.247
One minute.
Not a second more.

17:03.348 --> 17:05.851
Go up to him.
Come on.

17:10.222 --> 17:12.600
My darling Viveka.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.938
In the last few years...

17:16.027 --> 17:21.067
I know I've spent more time
on this house

17:21.166 --> 17:23.305
than I've spent on you.

17:24.736 --> 17:28.047
- We have to replace that roof tile.
- Dad, focus on Mom now.

17:28.140 --> 17:30.313
Sorry.

17:30.409 --> 17:32.912
But I can change.

17:34.045 --> 17:37.151
I Will change.

17:40.752 --> 17:42.698
FOR SALE

17:46.591 --> 17:50.004
Life is terribly short.

17:51.496 --> 17:57.174
There are so many things out there
that I want to see and experience.

17:57.269 --> 18:03.015
If you want to,
I'd like to experience them with you.

18:07.979 --> 18:09.617
Oh, Birger!

18:23.528 --> 18:25.098
Look at that.

18:43.448 --> 18:46.520
- I have to go.
- Give my best to Bruce.

18:51.990 --> 18:56.871
Wait. You have to drop me off
at the Antique Roadshow.

18:58.263 --> 19:01.403
Dad's therapy group.
Those women are ripe.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.309
You're disgusting, Gustaf.

19:03.401 --> 19:06.382
Not Gustaf. Jean-Luc.

19:06.471 --> 19:08.212
- Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

19:08.306 --> 19:11.913
It's like "Fight Club."

19:12.010 --> 19:13.990
Directed by David Fincher.

19:14.079 --> 19:16.252
Focus, Bengt.
Who are you?

19:16.348 --> 19:18.021
- Jack Nicholson.
- Great.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.528
- How did your wife die?
- Murdered.

19:20.619 --> 19:25.534
I sat on my Harley-Davidson.
The bullet went right through her.

19:25.624 --> 19:28.230
Oh, no. It's showtime.

19:28.326 --> 19:29.566
Bonjour.

19:29.661 --> 19:32.437
Hi, I'm Jack Nicholson.
