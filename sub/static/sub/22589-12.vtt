<i>NARRATOR".
We have previously seen...</i>

00:13.723 --> 00:16.768
<i>...in a jewelry shop, an antique clock...</i>

00:16.935 --> 00:20.188
<i>...that does more than tell time.</i>

00:21.898 --> 00:23.274
<i>Second Hands...</i>

00:23.441 --> 00:26.236
<i>...in a split-second robbery.</i>

00:27.153 --> 00:31.783
<i>The mental mainspring
of this timetable of crime, the Clock King.</i>

00:34.035 --> 00:36.454
<i>Batburgers at a drive-in.</i>

00:36.621 --> 00:38.540
<i>Batburgers?</i>

00:38.706 --> 00:43.127
<i>Now it's the Clock King
disguised as a pop artist.</i>

00:44.504 --> 00:47.298
<i>Batman and Robin pop into the picture.</i>

00:47.799 --> 00:52.053
<i>The Dynamic Duo
caught in the coils of time.</i>

00:53.763 --> 00:56.975
<i>Batman finds the Clock King's watch.</i>

00:58.434 --> 01:00.603
<i>A trail in the dust.</i>

01:02.230 --> 01:05.733
<i>Batman and Robin find Clock King's hideout.</i>

01:06.526 --> 01:09.988
<i>Blackjacks find the Dynamic Duo.</i>

01:11.364 --> 01:15.410
<i>And they find
they're trapped in a giant hourglass.</i>

01:17.704 --> 01:20.832
<i>The Clock King's watch was a trap.</i>

01:23.293 --> 01:25.962
Holy Sahara.

<i>NARRATOR".
And their utility belts out of reach.</i>

01:31.050 --> 01:33.428
<i>Meanwhile, the sands of time...</i>

01:33.595 --> 01:36.347
<i>...pour down with relentless force.</i>

01:36.514 --> 01:40.018
<i>Is this to be the Caped Crusader's
final adventure?</i>

01:40.184 --> 01:45.690
<i>In one moment, we'll come face-to-face
with the moment of truth.</i>

03:06.521 --> 03:07.772
It's no use, Robin.

03:07.939 --> 03:09.899
It's too thick.

03:10.108 --> 03:11.401
I've got it.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.737
Maybe we can plug up
the neck of the hourglass with our capes.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.614
For how long, Robin?

03:16.781 --> 03:19.742
Have you forgotten? This glass is airtight.

03:19.909 --> 03:24.163
Even if the sand doesn't suffocate us,
the lack of air will.

03:24.497 --> 03:27.375
Well, I guess we're finished.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.711
Don't give up yet, Robin.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.964
As long as we're alive, there's still a chance.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.967
I have an idea, Robin.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.677
It might work.

03:37.844 --> 03:41.305
You slam yourself
against your side of the glass...

03:41.472 --> 03:43.725
...and I'll do the same against mine. Hurry.

04:06.664 --> 04:07.999
Holy squirrel cage.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.502
The glass didn't break. What do we do now?

04:12.795 --> 04:14.547
Squirrel cage.

04:14.714 --> 04:16.173
That's it, Robin.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.051
Start running around
like a squirrel in a cage.

04:40.865 --> 04:44.035
I know I'm intruding
on two very busy officials.

04:44.202 --> 04:46.204
Intruding, Mrs. Cooper? Heh.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.540
My door is always open to a lady
as charming as yourself.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.376
And we do have Bruce Wayne
in common, don't we?

04:52.543 --> 04:54.212
Upstanding citizen.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.881
Well, Bruce is really the reason I'm here.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.217
You see, today is his birthday.

04:59.717 --> 05:03.054
And while I was downtown shopping,
I thought I'd drop by...

05:03.221 --> 05:07.391
...and see if I couldn't coax you into coming
to a little surprise party for him...

05:07.558 --> 05:09.227
...at Wayne Manor tonight.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.313
You won't have to twist my arm, Mrs. Cooper.
I'd be delighted.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.898
I'll second that.

05:14.065 --> 05:17.568
Good. Shall we say 7-ish?

05:17.735 --> 05:20.071
Very informal,
and bring your wives, of course.

05:26.953 --> 05:29.705
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Cooper.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.749
My direct line to Batman.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.418
Oh, how exciting.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.420
Yes, Batman?

05:36.921 --> 05:38.756
Robin too?

05:39.924 --> 05:41.259
Good.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.594
Thanks for calling.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.471
Not bad news, I hope?

05:45.638 --> 05:48.766
Ah. Merely checking in.

05:48.933 --> 05:52.895
Dependability is just one
of the Caped Crusader's many fine qualities.

05:53.062 --> 05:55.106
Oh, I know.

05:55.273 --> 05:59.277
I talk of him and Robin so often
to Bruce and Dick.

05:59.443 --> 06:03.155
What in the world Gotham City
would ever have done without them...

06:03.322 --> 06:05.616
...I don't-- Oh.

06:05.783 --> 06:08.786
I don't mean to discredit
your fine department.

06:08.953 --> 06:11.122
No need to apologize, Mrs. Cooper.

06:11.289 --> 06:14.375
We are all forever in debt
to the Dynamic Duo.

06:14.542 --> 06:18.796
So intrepid and yet so incognito.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.675
- Sevenish, then?
-Yes, indeed, 7-ish.

06:22.842 --> 06:24.677
- On the dot.
-Goodbye. Goodbye.

06:24.844 --> 06:26.429
Good bye.

06:28.139 --> 06:29.557
What about Batman?

06:31.350 --> 06:35.271
He wanted to tell us that he had successfully
escaped a vicious trap...

06:35.438 --> 06:37.815
...set for him by the Clock King.
-Hmm.

06:37.982 --> 06:41.235
But that evil adversary is still at large...

06:41.402 --> 06:44.780
...and no doubt
planning something even, hmm...

06:44.947 --> 06:47.158
...more monstrous.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.246
- Uniforms.
-Check.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.373
Everything ready for the big job,
Your Highness.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.000
This sure is tingling.

06:56.167 --> 07:00.546
Everything, including this box
and its contents.

07:00.713 --> 07:04.175
If only Batman knew what was in this box.

07:04.342 --> 07:05.843
But he'll never know.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.639
No. Batman will never
know anything anymore, eh, boys?

07:10.014 --> 07:11.349
That's right, Your Highness.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.184
You've done what nobody else
could've done.

07:13.351 --> 07:16.604
You finished off Batman and Robin.

07:19.565 --> 07:20.608
Thank you.

07:20.775 --> 07:23.736
I deserve it, of course, but I thank you.

07:23.903 --> 07:25.196
Time to go to work.

07:25.363 --> 07:30.242
First I want to check up on that windmill clock
bought by that dear little old lady.

07:30.785 --> 07:32.578
What dear little old lady?

07:32.745 --> 07:35.039
You'll see in a moment, Millie.

07:35.206 --> 07:37.375
And we'll see if that clock
has been put to use yet.

07:39.210 --> 07:43.339
<i>Oh, Alfred, look at what I got Bruce
for his birthday.</i>

07:43.506 --> 07:45.508
<i>He'll be so pleased.</i>

07:47.593 --> 07:49.637
He will indeed, madam.

07:49.804 --> 07:51.931
It's a rare antique.

07:52.098 --> 07:56.394
There are very few clocks
left like it in the world today.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.812
It's beautiful, madam.

07:57.979 --> 08:00.481
I'm sure Mr. Wayne will be most pleased.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.900
Bruce Wayne?

08:03.067 --> 08:04.735
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire?

08:04.902 --> 08:06.320
Yes, by George.

08:06.487 --> 08:10.157
That lady's the aunt
of Dick Grayson, Wayne's ward.

08:10.324 --> 08:14.495
When I learned she was shopping for a suitable
clock in a clock shop I knew about...

08:14.662 --> 08:19.917
...I sold the clock to the shopkeeper,
knowing he, in turn, would sell it to that lady.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.920
That brain of yours is always ticking away,
Your Highness.

08:23.087 --> 08:24.922
Just like a clock.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.969
I'm a little tired after my shopping, Alfred.

08:30.136 --> 08:35.725
I think I'll take a nap to be nice and fresh
for Bruce's birthday party tonight.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.145
<i>Oh, he'll be so surprised.</i>

08:40.104 --> 08:42.773
Bruce Wayne certainly will be surprised.

08:42.940 --> 08:46.610
Because he has a fine collection
of old antique pocket watches...

08:46.777 --> 08:49.780
...which we are going to appropriate
in a few minutes.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.615
Let's go.

08:54.994 --> 08:57.663
There's one thing that worries me,
Your Highness.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.915
Nothing should be worrying any of us now...

09:00.082 --> 09:01.917
...so near to our great goal.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.962
But that clock on the lady's piano.

09:05.129 --> 09:08.674
That's the one I thought that you wanted me
to put the little funny button on.

09:08.841 --> 09:09.884
It is.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.802
The control for the knockout gas.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.805
One whiff, the butler will be out cold...

09:14.972 --> 09:17.475
...and the antique pocket watches
will be all mine.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.728
Oh, no. No. Not that button.
I mean the button--

09:20.895 --> 09:22.313
You--

09:23.397 --> 09:27.193
You mean the Atomic Energy
Directional Control Switch?

09:27.359 --> 09:29.820
- Well, whatever it is.
-"Whatever it is"?

09:30.362 --> 09:33.282
Whatever it is
is supposed to be in this box.

09:33.449 --> 09:36.660
- Not in that clock.
-That's what worries me.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.538
- I think I made a mistake.
-Mistake.

09:39.705 --> 09:43.876
You just pulled the biggest
boneheaded blunder of the century.

09:44.043 --> 09:48.130
Now, If we don't get the windmill clock back
from Bruce Wayne's mansion in short order...

09:48.297 --> 09:50.925
...our big job will be ruined.

09:51.092 --> 09:52.510
There isn't a minute to lose.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.182
Your Highness, I'm sorry.
I never thought a funny little button--

09:58.349 --> 10:03.354
An Atomic Energy Directional Control Switch
is not a funny little button.

10:03.521 --> 10:06.649
That one's worth
a cool million dollars to us. Millie.

10:06.816 --> 10:09.652
- You can be of great help to me right now.
-Me?

10:09.819 --> 10:11.529
Gee. What do I do?

10:11.695 --> 10:12.863
Stay here...

10:13.030 --> 10:15.116
...and keep your eyes open,
but stay out of sight.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.326
Oh, I'll certainly try.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.620
If I can remember all that.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.289
Gee.

10:33.717 --> 10:38.347
- I think I got a little sand down my neck too.
-You're lucky it's only sand, Robin.

10:38.514 --> 10:42.393
An hourglass is not
the most practical of conveyances.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.979
Anyway, here it is.

10:45.146 --> 10:48.566
Our entire file on crooks named Smith.

10:49.024 --> 10:52.027
Good. I'll feed them into the Batcomputer...

10:53.070 --> 10:54.864
...and see if we can get the data...

10:55.030 --> 10:57.908
...on the mysterious Mr. Smith
Clock King mentioned.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.161
Hmm, I sure hope so.

11:00.327 --> 11:05.916
Boy, what I'd give to know where Clock King
is right at this very minute.

11:07.251 --> 11:11.088
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, up in the Wayne living room...</i>

11:39.909 --> 11:44.955
The Atomic Energy
Directional Control Switch is intact.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.083
I'm sure sorry about that mistake,
Your Highness.

11:50.461 --> 11:54.757
While I'm here, I might as well pick up that
valuable collection of antique pocket watches.

11:54.924 --> 11:56.884
I thought you said
there wasn't a minute to lose.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.802
It won't take long.

12:05.643 --> 12:09.146
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, down in the Batcave...</i>

12:10.856 --> 12:13.234
Gosh, if we get the correct information...

12:13.400 --> 12:16.320
...we'll have the Clock King
right where we want him.

12:17.446 --> 12:20.866
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, up in the Wayne living room...</i>

12:23.994 --> 12:27.331
<i>Meanwhile, down in the Batcave...</i>

12:28.791 --> 12:31.126
It won't be long now, Batman.

12:32.336 --> 12:35.756
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, up in the Wayne living room...</i>

12:44.807 --> 12:45.849
That was fast.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.811
Time is of the essence. Let's go.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.688
Good afternoon.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.524
- Bruce's birthday clock!
-Shh.

12:53.691 --> 12:56.610
- What are you doing here? Who are you?
-Shh.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.197
Help! Alfred, Alfred!

13:00.364 --> 13:02.283
Help! Alfred!

13:02.741 --> 13:05.869
-It's the little old lady, Your Highness.
-Dick Grayson's aunt.

13:06.036 --> 13:09.039
I think we better take her along with us.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.042
Alfred!

13:13.085 --> 13:15.004
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, down in the Batcave...</i>

13:17.589 --> 13:20.384
Why, it's Alfred's burglar alarm.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.429
There must be trouble upstairs.

13:32.896 --> 13:36.400
What do you mean, take me with you?
Where? How?

13:36.567 --> 13:39.111
That's a good question, Your Highness.
What do we put her in?

13:39.278 --> 13:41.238
Take these. I'll take care of her.

13:41.405 --> 13:44.241
No. Help, Alfred!

13:46.285 --> 13:49.079
You-- You called, madam?

13:52.916 --> 13:54.835
Holy hijackers.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.629
Clock King and his Second Hands
robbing Wayne Manor.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.757
Why, the brazen--

14:00.841 --> 14:02.176
Watch what you say.

14:02.343 --> 14:04.428
After all, we're not supposed to know them.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.846
Don't worry.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.097
Unhand my aunt.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.308
Sorry, gentlemen.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.060
We hope to make a safe getaway...

14:11.226 --> 14:14.396
...after lifting a few baubles
from this handsome residence.

14:14.563 --> 14:18.108
Perhaps this sweet lady
will provide that safety.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.277
You can take your baubles...

14:20.444 --> 14:23.614
...but you're not taking Mrs. Cooper
out of this house as a hostage.

14:23.781 --> 14:27.451
We may have a difference
of opinion there, mister.

14:30.788 --> 14:33.123
Quick. Out to the car.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.919
I think I'm going to faint.

14:37.086 --> 14:39.004
It's all right, Aunt Harriet. They're gone now.

14:39.171 --> 14:42.925
- They won't come back. Sit down. Sit down.
-imagine me being a hostage.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.802
It's all right. It's all right.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.012
I'm sorry I wasn't of much help, sir.

14:47.179 --> 14:50.140
They gave me rather a bad time
when they entered.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.184
That's quite all right, Alfred.

14:52.351 --> 14:55.270
Would you just see Mrs. Cooper
up to her room, please, Alfred?

14:55.437 --> 14:56.772
Certainly, sir.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.315
Here we go, madam.

14:58.482 --> 15:01.151
There. That's right.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.864
Are we gonna let them get away
just like that?

15:06.031 --> 15:09.159
By the time we got down to the Batmobile,
they'd be long gone, Dick.

15:09.326 --> 15:14.415
At least they didn't get away with my private
collection of antique pocket watches.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.960
Hmm. He seemed more concerned
with that clock that they had.

15:18.127 --> 15:20.712
Maybe it could be a lead, Bruce.
Wherever it came from.

15:20.879 --> 15:24.967
I still think the mysterious Mr. Smith
will provide the lead we need.

15:25.134 --> 15:27.594
Let's get back to the Batcave.

15:36.478 --> 15:37.521
How about this?

15:37.688 --> 15:42.276
Sable Sam Smith who specializes
in stealing valuable furs?

15:42.443 --> 15:46.530
Sorry, Robin.
He's serving a jail term right now.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.908
Here's one. Gibralter Smith.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.411
Alias "Smitty Smith the Safecracker."

15:52.578 --> 15:57.541
Smitty Smith was recently arrested
for armed robbery.

15:57.708 --> 16:00.961
He's back pounding rocks.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.463
I can just see him now.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.131
Old Smitty Smith.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.092
He used to be a real swinger
on the safe-and-lock circuit.

16:07.259 --> 16:10.387
Now he's swinging a hammer on a rock pile.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.766
I think you've got it, Robin.

16:16.727 --> 16:21.398
Clock King was making a pun
on the name "Smith."

16:22.024 --> 16:27.029
A Smith swings a hammer in a smithy.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.573
- Holy horseshoes.
-Exactly, Robin.

16:29.740 --> 16:33.285
Mr. Smith is a blacksmith.

16:33.452 --> 16:36.538
What connection could there be
between a blacksmith and Clock King?

16:36.705 --> 16:40.042
A blacksmith and a big-clock crime.

16:40.209 --> 16:42.920
A blacksmith and a big-clock crime.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.838
Blacksmith. Big clock.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.591
- Black--
-The big tower clock in downtown Gotham City.

16:47.758 --> 16:49.259
Let's take a look.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.317
Let's try another one.

17:06.944 --> 17:07.986
<i>Hmm.</i>

17:14.535 --> 17:16.286
- There's the blacksmith.
-Yes, Robin.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.622
And every hour, that mechanical marvel...

17:18.789 --> 17:23.794
...brings his hammer down to strike the anvil
in time with the clock.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.506
Clock King said that a certain Mr. Smith...

17:27.673 --> 17:32.511
...would be assisting with the crime
at exactly 5:00.

17:32.678 --> 17:35.847
Maybe he's going to put
something on the anvil...

17:36.014 --> 17:39.685
...that will be triggered
by the hammer when it strikes.

17:39.851 --> 17:44.314
Thus his real objective must be something
facing the clock tower.

17:47.901 --> 17:51.989
The only building facing the clock tower
is that one with the rooftop heliport.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.198
Right, Robin.

17:53.365 --> 17:56.159
His real objective must be the heliport.

17:56.326 --> 18:02.416
Someone or something of value must
be arriving at the heliport at exactly 5:00.

18:02.583 --> 18:05.544
Maybe Commissioner Gordon
can provide us with an answer.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.965
Five o'clock, Batman?

18:10.132 --> 18:12.342
Hold on. Let me see.

18:14.219 --> 18:18.473
One, two, three, four, five...

18:19.057 --> 18:21.059
Yes. There is one due at that time.

18:21.226 --> 18:25.856
A helicopter from the nuclear laboratory
of the Gotham Institute of Technology.

18:27.190 --> 18:30.319
Well, two noted physicists
will be delivering a cesium clock...

18:30.485 --> 18:33.697
...to the A.S.C. Corporation.

18:33.864 --> 18:38.201
Uh, purely routine.
We've taken no special precautions.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.038
A cesium clock?

18:41.204 --> 18:42.414
Thank you, commissioner.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.207
What's a cesium clock?

18:44.374 --> 18:49.713
A cesium clock is one that's regulated
by controlled atomic energy.

18:49.880 --> 18:55.218
It's frequently used in regulating
satellite tracking or in space probes.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.595
Holy lift-off.

18:56.762 --> 19:00.098
And I read recently that a cesium clock...

19:00.265 --> 19:05.896
...is being delivered to the Amalgamated
Communications Corporation...

19:06.063 --> 19:09.399
...for use in their tracking facilities.

19:10.776 --> 19:16.865
That means that it's the same clock that's being
delivered by helicopter today at 5:00.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.826
But what use would a cesium clock
be to Clock King?

19:19.993 --> 19:21.662
Lots of use, Robin.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.874
He could be holding the A.S.C. up
for ransom...

19:26.041 --> 19:30.087
...because a cesium clock is worth
at least a million dollars.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.506
We've no time to lose.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.508
To the tower.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.434
Atomic batteries to power.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.979
- Turbines to speed.
-Roger. Ready to move out.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.757
What a setup.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.135
But why do you want me here, Clock King?

20:18.301 --> 20:22.681
Any man wants a beautiful woman at his side,
Millie, at the climax of his career.

20:22.848 --> 20:24.641
- Gee.
-Get the uniforms out.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.977
We've little time for this whole operation.

20:27.144 --> 20:31.898
Now, these uniforms, forged credentials
and identification badges...

20:32.065 --> 20:35.736
...should give us carte blanche
to unload the cesium clock. The box.

20:36.695 --> 20:39.030
- But I still don't understand.
- No questions.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.534
You've already thrown us off schedule.
We haven't got a minute to lose.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.537
Now, at 5:00, when the clock strikes 5...

20:45.704 --> 20:47.539
...these figures will start to move.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.708
That hammer will come down on the box...

20:49.875 --> 20:52.753
...and trigger the knockout gas
across to the heliport.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.630
It won't affect us in our gas masks.

20:55.797 --> 21:00.594
We transfer to the heliport and fly
the cesium clock out on the helicopter.

21:00.761 --> 21:01.970
Simple.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.346
So very, very simple.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.391
Oh. I didn't know you could fly a helicopter.

21:06.558 --> 21:09.936
Millie, for a million dollars,
a man can do almost anything.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.564
Now, into the uniforms.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.741
No.

21:22.908 --> 21:24.868
It can't be true.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.787
You're dead.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.038
You have to be dead.

21:28.205 --> 21:32.375
- Maybe we're living on borrowed time.
-But now it's roundup time.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.211
Batman, look. His gun.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.715
Holy merry-go-round.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.218
That wild shot has started
the clockworks moving.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.803
Get them before they get you.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.263
Five o'clock.

23:08.847 --> 23:11.516
- Not bad for timing, huh, Batman?
-Yes, Robin.

23:11.683 --> 23:15.812
And that clock's tolling the end
of Clock King's crimes.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.402
Great job, Batman.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.195
I couldn't have done better meself.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.072
Thank you, Chief O'Hara.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.491
That's high praise indeed.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.494
You and the Boy Wonder
deserve a great deal of credit.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.080
Thanks to you, the Clock King
is behind bars at last.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.166
And high time too.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.169
Uh, no pun intended, Batman.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.338
Agreed, commissioner.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.341
And I find it only fitting...

23:44.507 --> 23:48.929
...that Clock King,
who made time serve his crimes...

23:49.095 --> 23:51.848
...must now serve time himself.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.850
Well put, Batman.

23:54.017 --> 23:58.021
And speaking of time, Chief O'Hara and I
are late right now for the birthday party...

23:58.188 --> 24:00.690
...Dick Grayson's aunt is giving
for millionaire Bruce Wayne.

24:01.441 --> 24:06.696
Robin and I had the honor
of being invited too, commissioner.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.240
Unfortunately, we cannot attend.

24:09.407 --> 24:12.410
Oh, too bad. It should be quite an affair.

24:12.577 --> 24:15.664
It's a surprise party, you know.

24:15.830 --> 24:19.960
I'm sure millionaire Bruce Wayne
will be quite surprised.

24:21.795 --> 24:25.090
- Well, Chief O'Hara, come on.
- All right, commissioner.
