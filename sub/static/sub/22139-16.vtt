00:39.873 --> 00:40.641
Hello?

00:42.276 --> 00:43.877
Wait.
Who was on the phone?

00:43.911 --> 00:45.613
Gah!

00:48.116 --> 00:52.220
**

00:52.253 --> 00:53.554
Screw it. I'm out.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.623
I've been wanting someone
to pass me those dumplings

00:55.656 --> 00:57.225
for half an hour,
but I don't know how to say,

00:57.258 --> 00:58.726
"Gimme them dumps"
in Mandarin.

Happy Year
of the Tiger, Dad!

01:44.104 --> 01:45.439
Yeah, yeah,
lots of luck and profits.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.175
What the heck is this?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.676
You know how much
I love school dances.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.144
Why didn't you tell me?

01:50.178 --> 01:52.780
I'm sorry. I totally meant to
tell you, but I forgot.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.516
So, this wasn't a deliberate
attempt to rob me of joy?

01:55.549 --> 01:57.851
No. I'm happy you know,
and really excited to go.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.087
Oh. Relief.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.455
So, who's your date
to the dance?

02:01.489 --> 02:02.690
I don't have one yet.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.124
I've been waiting
till Chinese New Year

02:04.158 --> 02:06.527
to ask out this girl I have
a crush on -- Celeste.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.362
Why would you wait
until New Year?

02:08.396 --> 02:09.863
Because according to
the Chinese zodiac,

02:09.897 --> 02:12.366
it marks the official end
of my bad luck year.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.436
This year has been brutal --
zits on the first day of school,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.471
girls ignoring me
left and right,

02:17.505 --> 02:19.440
rogue sprinklers
attacking me outside.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.874
I have noticed
you've been wet a lot.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.010
Plus, my letters to
the editor of TV Guide

02:23.043 --> 02:25.012
in support of "Dharma & Greg"
didn't get printed.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.814
I mean, it is a solid show.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.682
Anyway, now I can
ask out Celeste

02:28.716 --> 02:30.618
without fear of my bad luck
getting in the way.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.287
Hey, before you do, you want
some spritzes of my CK One?

02:33.321 --> 02:34.154
Not really.

02:35.823 --> 02:40.494
**

02:49.937 --> 02:51.372
What are they doing?

02:59.347 --> 03:01.949
That's me trying to call you.
Why aren't you picking up?

03:08.756 --> 03:10.691
Uh...what?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.529
That's annoying.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.600
Hello?

03:19.633 --> 03:21.168
Hey, Pizza Town!

03:21.201 --> 03:22.903
I'd like to order
an extra-large Meat Lovers.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.171
No, Marvin --

03:24.204 --> 03:25.606
And some
garlic knots and, uh --

03:27.140 --> 03:30.244
Louis, why are Jessica and Evan
speaking Chinese to me?

03:30.278 --> 03:31.579
They've challenged
each other to see

03:31.612 --> 03:33.547
who can speak Mandarin
longest.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.316
And as you know,
neither of them like to lose.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.554
You know what?
I got to get to work.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.022
You guys can handle
this one.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.061
Oh. Uh...

03:49.096 --> 03:50.063
Hello?

03:50.097 --> 03:52.866
Uh...yes,
shehere.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.603
Uh, y-- I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.438
Gus: Hello, Jessica!

03:57.471 --> 03:58.939
It's Gus and Mey-Mey,

03:58.972 --> 04:00.741
The Gemini Award-winning
co-hosts

04:00.774 --> 04:02.476
of "Good Morning Orlando"!

04:04.745 --> 04:06.046
Yay!

04:06.079 --> 04:08.081
Well..."Yay"
right back at ya!

04:09.417 --> 04:11.151
Listen, we know
it's short notice,

04:11.184 --> 04:13.621
but we would love to
have you on the show

04:13.654 --> 04:16.056
to promote
your upcoming book,

04:16.089 --> 04:18.125
"A Case of a Knife
to the Brain."

04:18.158 --> 04:19.293
Fun title!

04:19.327 --> 04:20.394
Stab! Stab!

04:20.428 --> 04:21.629
Oh, come on!

04:21.662 --> 04:23.497
Now, we're gonna level
with you, Jess.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.166
We're also calling because
we're in serious hot water

04:26.199 --> 04:29.169
for not doing a segment
about the Lunar New Year.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.906
Yeah, Connie Chung called,
and she was...pissed.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.742
Welp, it's Friday.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.745
I gave you all week to do
a piece on the Lunar New Year,

04:37.778 --> 04:38.746
but you didn't do it.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.614
You failed me!

04:40.648 --> 04:44.618
Both of you are so uninvited
to my Kentucky Derby bash.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.455
I'm so disappointed.
I wanted you to meet Maury.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.689
What?!

04:48.722 --> 04:50.691
So, we cast out
our diversity net,

04:50.724 --> 04:51.992
and we found you.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.528
She'd be happy to do it.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.530
O...kay!
Ohhhh, baby!
That's wonderful!

04:56.564 --> 04:57.665
Fantastic!

04:57.698 --> 04:58.766
Have a lovely day!

04:58.799 --> 05:00.468
Bye.
Diversity checked.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.946
**

05:12.980 --> 05:14.515
What are you gonna do?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.216
You can't promote your book
speaking Chinese.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.190
I think you said something
about hamburgers.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.363
Grandma, with the red envelope
you gave me,

05:29.397 --> 05:31.198
I'm only $50 shy
of my goal!

05:33.734 --> 05:35.803
I'm getting a subwoofer
for my future car.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.238
Get the keys,
throw out the spare tire,

05:38.271 --> 05:40.140
and drop in
a pair of 12s.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.809
And this package
from Big Auntie

05:41.842 --> 05:43.911
holds the lucky money that's
gonna put me over the top.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.881
"To Sweet Evan"...

05:47.915 --> 05:49.016
"To Pretty Emery"...

05:53.387 --> 05:56.089
That's weird.
Mine's not in there.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.758
Hi, Big Auntie.
It's Eddie.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.192
Uh, so, we got
your New Year's package,

05:59.226 --> 06:01.061
but you forgot to put in
my red envelope.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.396
I didn't forget.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.764
What?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.332
I didn't give you one.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.335
You and I have been in a fight
for over a year.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.770
We have

06:09.803 --> 06:11.772
You know what you did.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.516
Whoa.
Emery, you okay?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.851
No.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.786
I went
to ask out Celeste.

06:27.154 --> 06:33.794
**

06:33.827 --> 06:40.634
**

06:40.668 --> 06:42.436
Why didn't you
talk to her?

06:44.004 --> 06:46.206
Girls used to always
approach me.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.042
You're only supposed to have
bad luck every 12 years,

06:49.076 --> 06:51.779
but I guess mine's
never gonna end.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.815
You know,
when I was 24,

06:54.848 --> 06:58.151
your grandma told me it was
my double-bad-luck year.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.087
I was in a new country,
struggling with English,

07:00.120 --> 07:02.923
earning pennies
as a busboy.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.625
I could've accepted
my destiny of bad luck,
[ The Sugarhill Gang's
"Rapper's Delight" plays ]

07:04.658 --> 07:07.761
but instead,
I did something about it.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.296
What'd you do?

07:09.329 --> 07:11.264
I danced, son.

07:11.298 --> 07:14.167
I entered a dance contest,
and I danced hard.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.504
* I said a hip, hop,
hippie, the hippie *

07:16.537 --> 07:18.806
* Hip hip a hop,
and you don't stop to rock it *

07:18.839 --> 07:20.674
* Do the bang bang boogie,
say up jump the boogie *

07:20.708 --> 07:22.810
* To the rhythm of the boogie,
the beat *

07:22.843 --> 07:24.978
* Now, what you hear
is not a test *

07:25.012 --> 07:27.280
* I'm rappin' to the beat

07:27.314 --> 07:29.349
* And me, the groove,
and my friends *

07:29.382 --> 07:31.485
* Are gonna try
to move your feet *

07:31.519 --> 07:32.986
I won that contest,

07:33.020 --> 07:36.256
and that win snowballed into
more good things in my life.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.926
Just like I did,
you can make your own luck.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.829
And it starts with
asking Celeste to the dance.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.030
That's a nice story, Dad.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.200
I just...
can't take another rejection.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.804
**

07:57.645 --> 08:01.982
* Mmmbop, ba duba dop,
ba duba dop *

08:05.586 --> 08:06.887
* Yeah, yeah

08:13.761 --> 08:15.062
* Ba du

08:15.095 --> 08:19.299
As a dentist, it's vital
that I test the New Year's candy

08:19.332 --> 08:21.034
and take notes
on what I'm up against.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.539
Mmm. Interesting.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.409
Emery: Dad!

08:29.442 --> 08:30.578
The new TV Guide came,

08:30.611 --> 08:32.212
and my letter to the editor
was printed!

08:32.245 --> 08:34.381
Oh, that's amazing!
So amazing.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.117
I'd given up on it,
but maybe my luck is changing.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.887
What's his secret, Lou?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.855
I've sent letters
to TV Guid for years.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.491
Well, let's just say
his secret is having a dad

08:44.524 --> 08:46.760
who knows Kenny Rogers.
What do you mean?

08:46.794 --> 08:49.697
Emery was in need of a
dance-related confidence boost,

08:49.730 --> 08:51.699
so I had Kenny pull some strings
and get his letter published.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.766
I'm still not following.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.501
I got Emery in TV Guide.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.268
How so?

08:59.607 --> 09:00.908
When you're done
reading that rag --

09:00.941 --> 09:02.275
The New York Times --

09:02.309 --> 09:03.911
there's an amazing letter
to the editor

09:03.944 --> 09:05.713
about "Dharma & Greg"
in this TV Guide.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.552
"The writers of 'Dharma & Greg'
have done it again.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.454
I can't believe
Greg's gonna run for Congress.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.923
Emery Huang, Orlando."

09:17.224 --> 09:18.926
Louis:
Very insightful, Emery.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.361
Remember what I said
about making your own luck?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.863
This letter is
just the beginning.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.932
After breakfast, I'm gonna go
ask Celeste to the dance.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.233
The Year of the Tiger
is here,

09:26.266 --> 09:27.768
and good things
are coming my way.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.402
Ride the tiger
high and hard.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.971
To the moon!
Sure.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.209
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to tonight's meeting.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.212
We will begin by taking a vote
on the new bylaw proposals.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.147
And by the way...

09:41.448 --> 09:42.149
...Evan and Jessica.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.587
Thank you for that traditional
Chinese response

09:47.621 --> 09:49.823
to my well wishes.

09:49.857 --> 09:53.293
So, Evan has introduced a bylaw
proposing that we recognize

09:53.326 --> 09:55.996
Martin Luther King Jr. Day
as a neighborhood holiday.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.924
All those in favor?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.693
Aye.Aye.
Aye.Aye.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.626
All those opposed?

10:27.895 --> 10:29.997
And the bylaw passes!

10:30.030 --> 10:32.666
Oh, congratulations,
everyone!

10:32.700 --> 10:35.235
Especially all of our
African-American friends.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.107
...who...couldn't
make it today.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.809
**

10:43.510 --> 10:45.545
I can't figure out what I did
to offend Big Auntie.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.080
Could you talk to her for me
and ask her what I did wrong?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.887
You are

11:04.732 --> 11:05.665
Were they?

11:15.575 --> 11:16.844
Hello?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.813
Louis, I need you to come down
to the station.

11:19.847 --> 11:20.881
We have Emery.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.418
Son, are you okay?
What happened?

11:25.452 --> 11:26.653
I'm fine.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.588
I just wanted a big gesture
to impress Celeste

11:28.621 --> 11:29.990
before I asked her
to the dance.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.194
**

11:37.264 --> 11:39.399
But I guess
Officer Killjoy over here

11:39.432 --> 11:41.334
has never seen anyone
dove-up on a lady.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.036
I had no choice
but to detain him

11:43.070 --> 11:44.872
for having
unpermitted doves.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.573
Doves?

11:46.606 --> 11:49.109
But walking in a mesh tank top
with fireworks is okay?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.678
It's Florida. That image
was almost our state flag.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.182
**

11:55.215 --> 11:58.718
Announcer:
This is "Jeopardy!"

12:03.723 --> 12:05.558
Hey, hey, hey!

12:05.592 --> 12:08.528
Thanks for the invite
to come by and watch "Jeopardy!"

12:08.561 --> 12:10.463
We've never been invited over
via a note

12:10.497 --> 12:12.232
being slid under the door
before.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.238
Alex Trebek: Used to mark
a major division in a sentence,

12:18.271 --> 12:19.572
it shares its name

12:19.606 --> 12:21.641
with a section
of your large intestine.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.410
What is, uh, uh...

12:23.443 --> 12:24.611
col

12:24.644 --> 12:25.612
Colon -- right.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.080
Yeah! I got it right!

12:37.925 --> 12:40.427
Hey, hey, no cheating, you two.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.629
The name
of this extinct critter

12:42.662 --> 12:44.664
comes from words
meaning "terrible lizard."

12:44.697 --> 12:45.732
What is Godzilla?

12:45.765 --> 12:46.967
Dinosaur -- yes.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.169
Oh, man! I'm on fire!

12:52.705 --> 12:56.343
In 1949, mainland China
became a communist state

12:56.376 --> 12:58.145
with this man as its leader.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.283
Woman: Who is Mao Zedong?
You're right.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.352
Unh-unh!
Nope, nope. Sorry, Evan.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.454
You have to answer
in the form of a question.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.961
Yeah. "Jeopardy!'s"
a tough game, kid.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.529
Hey, live a few years
before you take on the big boys!

13:17.697 --> 13:19.867
Jessica, are you really
still doing this?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.169
You're going on TV tomorrow.
What are you gonna do?

13:28.741 --> 13:30.844
Emery, we need to have
a serious talk --

13:30.878 --> 13:33.180
which is impossible while
you're wearing a mesh tank top.

13:41.721 --> 13:45.492
Look, I know I encouraged you
to ride the tiger high and hard,

13:45.525 --> 13:47.460
but this isn't
what I had in mind.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.662
I was just making my own luck,
like you told me to.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.464
And if Bryson
hadn't stopped me,

13:51.498 --> 13:53.366
Celeste would already be
my date to the dance.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.302
I'm happy
that your confidence is back,

13:55.335 --> 13:56.904
but you're acting like
a different person.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.305
You're getting
way too cocky.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.973
How is Emery cocky?

14:00.007 --> 14:02.009
You just said your name
in the third person!

14:03.343 --> 14:06.213
Look, when I won
that dance trophy,

14:06.246 --> 14:08.882
my confidence
was sky high.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.717
I could've gotten a big head
and bragged about it

14:10.750 --> 14:13.020
to everyone I knew,
but I didn't.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.523
I remained humble,
because that's who I am.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.026
The Emery before your
bad-luck year was confident,

14:19.059 --> 14:20.727
but humble, too.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.896
I just want you
to be you again.

14:22.930 --> 14:26.266
It's been so long since
something good happened to me.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.701
I guess I let it
go to my head.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.403
But you're right.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.440
I can be happy with my good luck
and still be me.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.376
Ride the tiger low
and with measured enthusiasm.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.114
I just saw an episode
of "Frasier."

14:41.148 --> 14:43.416
They replaced Eddie the dog
with another dog.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.417
What?

14:44.451 --> 14:46.019
And I wrote this letter

14:46.053 --> 14:47.720
to expose
that little charade.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.189
And you just got to
use your connections

14:49.222 --> 14:50.623
to get it into TV Guide.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.525
Connections?

14:52.559 --> 14:55.128
Dad, you're the reason
I got into TV Guide?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.868
Relax your fist, Lou.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.070
Receive my letter.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.413
Hey, Celeste?
I'm Trent.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.382
You don't know me, but I'm here
as an age-appropriate face

15:15.415 --> 15:16.883
so you won't
freak out.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.750
Are you freaking out?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.386
Uh...no?

15:19.419 --> 15:20.387
Great.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.255
Okay, Mr. Huang!
All good!

15:22.289 --> 15:25.325
Hi! I'm Emery's dad.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.594
Didn't want you
to open the door

15:27.627 --> 15:29.729
and find a 40-year-old strange
man wanting to talk to you.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.065
What's happening?

15:32.099 --> 15:33.633
Relax, Celeste.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.602
I'm your age, so that makes
all of this normal.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.304
Uh, there's a big dance
coming up.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.938
Can you ask my son
to go with you?

15:38.972 --> 15:40.974
It would really
boost his confidence.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.676
Red alert. Red alert.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.478
Hush.
I'm talking to Celeste.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.846
Bogey on your six.
Code blue!

15:46.879 --> 15:47.847
Trent, please!

15:47.880 --> 15:48.948
Dad?

15:48.982 --> 15:50.450
What are you
doing here?

15:51.651 --> 15:55.622
I think your dad's asking me
to ask you to the dance.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.690
What?!

15:57.724 --> 16:00.593
I know this looks bad, but I was
just trying to help you.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.195
I don't want your help.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.297
You're the one who said
we have to make our own luck.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.399
But how can I do that
when you're trying to
make my luck for me?

16:10.837 --> 16:13.506
I know this didn't work out
how you hoped, Mr. Huang,

16:13.540 --> 16:15.708
but I still expect the free
all-you-can-eat baked potato bar

16:15.742 --> 16:17.377
you promised me.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.383
Okay, I forged a customs form
to prove your package was denied

16:23.416 --> 16:25.052
so Big Auntie will believe your
story about sending the seeds.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.723
Then you'll help me figure out
why Big Auntie's mad at me?

16:31.724 --> 16:32.392
Cool.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.765
I'm 14.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.703
Yeah, I'm loaded
with cat hair.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.005
I don't even know --
I don't own a cat.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.308
I can't believe your mom's
going through with this.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.910
I mean, is she gonna do
the whole interview in Mandarin?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.387
Okay, kid. I'm just gonna
mic you up real quick.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.524
Wait. No, no, sir.
I don't think he needs
to be wired for sound.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.893
Lady, I'm just doing
what I was told.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.495
Okay.
He's good to go.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.230
Come with me.

17:10.263 --> 17:15.535
**

17:42.795 --> 17:47.867
**

17:47.900 --> 17:49.636
Well played.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.239
You know
who the real winner is here?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.773
A child's love
for his mother.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.310
And the loser is you.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.746
Okay, I don't need
a translator anymore!

17:59.779 --> 18:01.348
Let's get this kid
out of here!

18:03.116 --> 18:05.385
That looks like fun.
Buy tickets to that.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.287
I thought
you didn't speak English.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.256
Must be
a Lunar New Year miracle.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.823
So, at the end
of the interview,

18:10.857 --> 18:12.492
I would like to address
the camera

18:12.525 --> 18:14.461
to speak directly
to Connie Chung.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.396
**

18:22.135 --> 18:26.072
I've been way out of line
the past few days.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.941
Getting that win at the dance
contest changed my life,

18:28.975 --> 18:32.279
and I badly wanted to give you
the same victory.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.113
Doesn't make
what you did okay.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.148
I know.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.586
I felt so good
after the contest

18:39.619 --> 18:43.122
because I made the choice to
go for it and make my own luck.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.957
I should've encouraged you
to do the same thing,

18:44.991 --> 18:48.628
instead of manipulating things
to make it happen.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.529
I'm sorry.

18:49.562 --> 18:55.502
**

18:55.535 --> 18:58.305
This always brought me
good luck.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.839
Maybe it'll do
the same for you.

19:20.927 --> 19:21.961
Guys!

19:32.339 --> 19:33.540
You paid off the judge?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.553
I never thought of it
that way.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.121
I'm gonna tell Dad
I forgive him.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.830
**

20:03.102 --> 20:04.604
Hey, Celeste.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.239
I'm sorry about yesterday
with my dad.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.674
That's okay.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.041
Dads are weird.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.378
Mine says "We needed it"
every time it rains.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.180
I was wondering...

20:14.213 --> 20:15.748
would you go to
the Spring Fling with me?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.718
Yeah. I'd like that.

20:18.751 --> 20:28.361
**

20:28.395 --> 20:29.462
Dad!

20:29.496 --> 20:31.964
Celeste said "yes"!
The jacket worked!

20:31.998 --> 20:34.233
Yes! I knew it!

20:34.267 --> 20:37.236
Ooh. Okay, now you need some
moves to go with that jacket.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.705
Now, this is
the Louis Special.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.206
You start out
like th--

20:40.239 --> 20:42.108
No, these aren't
the right pants for this.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.586
Boom!

20:53.620 --> 20:55.522
So, did you ask why
she and I are in a fight?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.364
So she blamed both of us
when the seeds didn't arrive.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.970
Subwoofer,
here I come!

21:14.307 --> 21:15.174
What!

21:22.114 --> 21:25.685
**
