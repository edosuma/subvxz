00:04.972 --> 00:07.139
with that
space peasant disguise.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.808
I know it's you,
Jord Cloudbeam.

00:09.877 --> 00:12.578
[laser-swords humming]

00:12.646 --> 00:14.146
- Yes, it's me.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.181
And as long as there are
Interrobang aliens

00:16.250 --> 00:17.750
terrorizing the galaxy,

00:17.818 --> 00:19.151
I'll be there to fight them.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.152
There is always light

00:20.221 --> 00:21.787
if you look to the stars.

00:21.856 --> 00:22.855
- There's also a clog

00:22.923 --> 00:25.691
if you look to the toilet.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.559
- Hey, Wilson,
we were just imagining

00:27.628 --> 00:29.795
we were in
a "Space Conflicts" movie.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.398
- They're shooting the new
spin-off TV series downtown.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.665
Darby made us these costumes

00:33.734 --> 00:34.933
so we can blend in
with the extras

00:35.002 --> 00:36.068
and get onto the set.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.102
- If you really want
to see something

00:37.171 --> 00:38.270
that's out of this world,

00:38.339 --> 00:40.305
come give me a hand
with the toilet.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.174
- I'll take your word for it.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.977
- Hopefully we'll see
Jord Cloudbeam.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.645
I've idolized him
since I was seven.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.147
I had
the Jord Cloudbeam backpack,

00:48.215 --> 00:49.882
the light-up shoes,
the lunch box...

00:49.950 --> 00:51.083
the underwear!

00:51.152 --> 00:52.317
- He's my favorite character
too.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.585
In fact, I still eat

00:53.654 --> 00:55.487
Jord Cloudbeam cereal
every morning.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.989
- I can't believe
in a couple hours,

00:57.058 --> 00:59.825
we might actually get to see
Jord Cloudbeam in person.

00:59.894 --> 01:00.793
- Wait a minute.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.428
You mean today?

01:02.496 --> 01:03.996
I hope your boss is a cool guy

01:04.065 --> 01:06.331
and let you leave work early.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.168
- Yeah, he's the coolest.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.904
With an unrivaled sense
of style.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.372
And a soothing deep voice

01:13.441 --> 01:15.474
that sounds great
when he says things like...

01:15.543 --> 01:17.776
[deep voice]
"You can leave work early."

01:19.647 --> 01:21.113
- You can leave work early.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.314
- See how soothing
that sounded?

01:22.383 --> 01:24.883
- If you bring me back
a prop from the set

01:24.952 --> 01:26.952
signed by Jord Cloudbeam.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.353
- That sounded less soothing.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.622
But you got a deal.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.091
- Don't you dare come back
empty-handed.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.092
- We promise.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.993
Pinky promise.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.028
Ready to go, Milo?

01:36.097 --> 01:37.196
- Let's do this!

01:37.264 --> 01:39.198
Or as Jord Cloudbeam
would say...

01:39.266 --> 01:41.166
[heroically]
Let's do this!

01:43.104 --> 01:44.470
- Wait, what about the toilet?

01:44.538 --> 01:46.071
- Pretend you didn't hear him.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.339
- I heard you say that.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.212
I'm Jord Cloudbeam,

01:53.280 --> 01:55.681
a space pirate
like my father before me.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.862
Ah!

02:11.365 --> 02:12.764
I am so sorry.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.133
I was pretending
that was a laser-axe

02:14.201 --> 02:16.068
and I was Jord Cloudbeam.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.636
Right, right.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.687
the security guard was gonna

incredible costuming skills,

Okay.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.254
You're going.
I guess we're doing this.

Luckily, I brought
this space visor.

Perfect.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.349
I can't see a thing.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.221
Do you think he would like
this chair?

03:42.289 --> 03:44.056
I could get Jord

You're not allowed to just take

Wilson will love this.

- No, I meant there's a lot
of great options on here.

I was thinking of ordering
a Vortak kebab.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.736
Where do we order?

03:57.805 --> 03:58.770
- Hurley?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.240
This is not a real restaurant.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.441

04:02.509 --> 04:03.942

04:33.073 --> 04:34.406
- We're over here.

- No, I didn't wanna be

Sorry, I can't see

You, stand with
the other Interrobangs.

- I can just stand

way over there.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.149
Or maybe I don't need to be
in the scene.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.685

to order a glass of orange milk

05:53.754 --> 05:55.454

to him.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.456

Me? Really?

this Vortak kebab.

That's much better.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.766
- You seem relatively normal.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.569
- [gasps]
No one's ever said that.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.538
In fact, my friend Margo
from back home

07:19.606 --> 07:21.072
said I was the oddest duck
she'd ever met.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.941
And she would know--
she bred odd ducks

07:23.010 --> 07:23.975

Now please stop talking,
and hand him the milk.

my favorite sci-fi franchise.

16:11.087 --> 16:12.387
Plus, I think
this boo-boo is turning

16:12.455 --> 16:14.088
into a full-blown ouchie.

16:14.157 --> 16:15.390
- Don't worry.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.325
I have an idea.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.493
- Let's go!

16:18.561 --> 16:21.062
And action!

16:21.131 --> 16:22.230
- Stop!

16:22.298 --> 16:25.066
It is I,
a random Interrobang alien.

16:25.135 --> 16:27.935
And I say we cease
this senseless battle.

16:28.004 --> 16:30.038
We've been at odds
for millennia,

16:30.106 --> 16:32.573
fighting the same war
our fathers fought.

16:32.642 --> 16:34.709
And their fathers before them.

16:34.778 --> 16:37.378
The time has come
to put aside our differences

16:37.447 --> 16:39.313
and stand up for what's right!

16:39.382 --> 16:42.150
- Speak your truth, girl!

16:42.218 --> 16:43.418
Forget spoilers.

16:43.486 --> 16:45.920
You're gonna want to see
and hear this.

16:45.989 --> 16:47.488
- My blood might be red,

16:47.557 --> 16:49.490
and your blood might be blue,

16:49.559 --> 16:51.159
and this guy's blood
might be green.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.660
I'm not sure what he is.

16:52.729 --> 16:54.929
- I'm a Gurg.
We don't have blood.

16:54.998 --> 16:56.831
- Whatever, the point is,

16:56.900 --> 16:58.633
we're all the same underneath.

16:58.702 --> 16:59.967
Minus the blood color,

17:00.036 --> 17:01.402
which I previously stated

17:01.471 --> 17:02.937
is different.

17:03.006 --> 17:04.939
- Wow, this speech is better
than the one

17:05.008 --> 17:07.675
in "The Rise of the Return
of the Revenge"!

17:07.744 --> 17:09.477
- I guess I don't need
this script anymore

17:09.546 --> 17:12.880
since no one's following it!

17:12.949 --> 17:14.048
- Ow.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.385
I just got a paper cut
on my nose.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.387
Wait, this is, like,
the whole script.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.888
It has every scene in here.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.023
- Really?

17:22.092 --> 17:22.990
Give it to me!

17:23.059 --> 17:24.025
No, don't!

17:24.094 --> 17:25.159
I don't wanna know.

17:25.228 --> 17:27.195
But I do. But I can't.

17:27.263 --> 17:30.331
But I will!

17:30.400 --> 17:34.836
So. Many. Spoilers!

17:34.904 --> 17:36.504
- We have
to film something today.

17:36.573 --> 17:38.573
You know what?
Forget the choreography!

17:38.641 --> 17:40.074
Everybody, try to hurt Jord.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.243
Jord, try not to get hurt.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.578
- What?
[bell rings]

17:43.646 --> 17:45.146
What do I do?
- Hey.

17:45.215 --> 17:47.582
What would seven-year-old Milo
think if he knew that one day,

17:47.650 --> 17:49.650
he'd be standing on the set
of "Space Conflicts"

17:49.719 --> 17:52.720
facing off against a couple
of Interrobang aliens?

17:52.789 --> 17:54.155
- I guess he'd say
it's pretty cool.

17:54.224 --> 17:56.557
- So are you gonna call
your mom to come pick you up,

17:56.626 --> 17:59.160
or are you gonna stay
and fight?

17:59.229 --> 18:00.695
- Let's do this!

18:00.764 --> 18:02.563
And I'll call my mom later
and tell her all about it.

18:02.632 --> 18:04.232
- Yeah.
- Action!

18:04.300 --> 18:06.200
- Ah!

18:08.171 --> 18:09.270
- You mess with Jord,

18:09.339 --> 18:10.872
you mess with me!

18:13.610 --> 18:14.642
- Go, Jord!

18:14.711 --> 18:16.477
Go, random Interrobang alien!

18:16.546 --> 18:17.912
- Oh, my Jord.

18:17.981 --> 18:19.113
Oh, my Jord.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.516
Jord, have mercy!

18:21.584 --> 18:25.153
Nooo!

18:27.290 --> 18:30.057
- [screams]

18:31.161 --> 18:33.261
Random Interrobang alien,

18:33.329 --> 18:34.962
one orange milk.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.263
[bell rings]

18:52.332 --> 18:53.798
We didn't die.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.167
- Great idea
with the orange milk, Milo.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.902
- Shh, don't blow my cover.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.237
- Well, I just thought
since you weren't

18:59.305 --> 19:00.204
wearing your helmet...

19:00.273 --> 19:01.672
- What?

19:01.741 --> 19:04.108
- What is going on?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.143
Where's Chet?

19:05.211 --> 19:06.911
You two are the worst!

19:06.980 --> 19:09.647
Security, I have
some delinquents on my set,

19:09.716 --> 19:12.350
including one who's
impersonating Jord Cloudbeam.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.484
- Hey, hey, wait a sec.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.685
Those are our friends.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.887
If you're gonna kick them out,

19:15.955 --> 19:17.388
then you're gonna have
to kick us out too.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.589
- Works for me.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.191
Hope you're happy.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.693
You kids have ruined my show!

19:22.762 --> 19:24.028
- Hang on, C.C.

19:24.097 --> 19:26.597
These kids didn't
ruin anything.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.799
In fact,
I was thinking about quitting,

19:28.868 --> 19:30.568
but Milo reminded me

19:30.637 --> 19:32.904
how important Jord Cloudbeam
is to the world.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.505
And he told me
he cries like a baby

19:34.574 --> 19:36.274
every time he has to make
a speech.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.475
- It was once.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.809
In second grade.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.878
- And now, thanks to Milo,

19:40.947 --> 19:42.513
I'm ready to give
this performance

19:42.582 --> 19:43.814
all that I've got.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.684
- You saved "Space Conflicts."

19:49.989 --> 19:52.056
- It was an honor
to step in for you.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.090
- Thanks, kid.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.026
You brought balance
to the vibes.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.262
Let's do this.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.497
- Hey, imposter!

19:59.566 --> 20:02.066
Don't move!

20:02.135 --> 20:03.968
- [groans]

20:04.037 --> 20:05.937
- [grunts]

20:06.005 --> 20:08.039
- Yeah, we should probably go.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.307
- Definitely.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.210
But, real quick,
can you sign this bread roll?

20:12.278 --> 20:13.544
- Ruby.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.281
- Don't be sad, Darby.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.416
It's a bummer we have to leave,

20:18.484 --> 20:20.184
but it was still a fun day.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.485
- Oh, no.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.387
These are happy tears.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.722
I just read that Jord Cloudbeam

20:24.791 --> 20:27.158
ends up marrying
Princess Nebula.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.795
all: Aww, spoilers!

20:38.738 --> 20:40.304
Is Wilson here yet?

20:40.373 --> 20:41.739
Whoa.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.307
Why are you still wearing
your alien makeup?

20:43.376 --> 20:45.343
- I couldn't bring myself
to wash it off.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.510
Yesterday was so fun.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.645
I didn't want it to end.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.980
- Huh.
- Hey, Milo.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.014
Hey, alien Ruby.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.983
So where's my autographed prop
from set?

20:52.051 --> 20:55.086
- Well, the thing is,
we didn't get you an autograph.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.287
- What?

20:56.356 --> 20:57.722
That's the only reason
I gave you the day off.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.724
We made a pinky promise.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.193
Do pinky promises mean nothing
to you?

21:02.262 --> 21:03.527
- We didn't get you
an autograph

21:03.596 --> 21:06.130
because we got you
something better.

21:06.199 --> 21:07.231
[clears throat]

Chet?

The real Jord Cloudbeam!

21:13.740 --> 21:16.474
[screams]

21:16.542 --> 21:19.176
- You're excited. I get it.

21:19.245 --> 21:22.446
- Hey, thanks for coming by,
Chet.

21:22.515 --> 21:26.617
I cannot believe the real
Jord Cloudbeam is here!

21:26.686 --> 21:28.152
- Sorry we messed up
so many things

21:28.221 --> 21:30.121
on set yesterday.
- Are you kidding me?

21:30.189 --> 21:32.456
We ended up keeping
your fight scene in the show.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.358
- Even the part
where I threw the bread rolls?

21:34.427 --> 21:35.860
- Yeah, but we're gonna use
special effects

21:35.928 --> 21:37.762
to make them look
like fireballs.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.397
All right, what do you need me
to sign?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.265
Let's do this.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.466
- Ooh!

21:42.535 --> 21:44.402
Sign that poster,
sign that comic,

21:44.470 --> 21:46.470
sign that wall, and--ooh!

Can you sign me?
