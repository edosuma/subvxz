Alicorn, distancing socially.

02:47.794 --> 02:50.462
Of course.

02:50.495 --> 02:51.496
Mm.

02:51.530 --> 02:52.932
Hey, I gotta go, okay?

03:03.843 --> 03:05.711
Hello.

03:05.745 --> 03:06.712
How are you?

03:06.746 --> 03:08.080
That's great.

03:08.114 --> 03:10.783
I'm DJ Satur8

03:10.817 --> 03:14.619
and I will be
live streamin' new music

03:15.554 --> 03:18.024
that will tickle your ears.

03:19.692 --> 03:22.028
Hold your hands

03:22.061 --> 03:26.065
and make love to your hearts

03:26.098 --> 03:29.367
as we

03:29.401 --> 03:31.070
sequester together.

03:35.141 --> 03:36.876
This ain't even mine.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.987
Oh, fuck.

04:00.432 --> 04:02.702
Ugh, I don't care...
hey, hold on one second.

04:02.735 --> 04:04.136
I don't care.

04:04.170 --> 04:07.405
Look, I am not replacing uh,
uh, another toilet seat

04:07.439 --> 04:09.842
this entire pandemic.

04:09.876 --> 04:11.911
So clean it... clean it up.

04:14.013 --> 04:15.648
Do not have kids ever.

04:15.681 --> 04:16.514
It's never ideal.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.616
Yeah.

04:17.649 --> 04:18.985
Okay, yeah,
I'll keep that in mind.

04:19.017 --> 04:20.853
What in the fuck?

04:20.887 --> 04:23.990
Carol texted me the other night,
I think I forgot to respond.

04:24.023 --> 04:24.824
Is she alright?

04:24.857 --> 04:26.626
She good, you good,
the kids good?

04:26.659 --> 04:29.829
Oh yeah, they're great,
Carol's great,

04:29.862 --> 04:30.696
everyone is great.

04:30.730 --> 04:32.665
You know,
what's not great is my ass.

04:32.698 --> 04:36.702
If one of my children
paints a ninja

04:36.736 --> 04:39.171
or a princess

04:39.205 --> 04:43.508
or a Power Dino Ranger Monkey

04:43.541 --> 04:48.180
with markers on my toilet seat
one more time, I'm not...

04:48.214 --> 04:50.548
I swear to God,
I hate the Internet.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.218
It's just...
it's just prank videos

04:52.251 --> 04:55.453
teaching children how
to destroy their parents!

04:55.487 --> 04:57.622
Do not take
the Lord's name in vain!

04:57.657 --> 04:59.191
I was praying!

05:00.726 --> 05:03.062
It sounds like your lockdown
is goin' pretty rough.

05:04.063 --> 05:05.031
Rough.

05:05.064 --> 05:07.733
I've got the ugliest princess

05:07.767 --> 05:09.735
flyin' out of my asshole
right now.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.003
And that's
enough cursing out of you.

05:11.037 --> 05:12.905
I am...

05:13.873 --> 05:16.876
I'm expressing with emotion,
dear.

05:16.909 --> 05:22.048
I always cuss
when I express with emotion.

05:23.983 --> 05:25.184
Enough about my fantastic life.

05:25.217 --> 05:26.018
How are you doing?

05:26.052 --> 05:27.653
How's your dad?

05:27.687 --> 05:30.756
Um, fine I guess.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.490
I don't really know.

05:32.524 --> 05:35.628
We haven't really had
a lot of time to connect lately

05:35.661 --> 05:41.200
and uh, it's... it's tough
to see him you know, like that.

05:41.233 --> 05:41.934
But forget it.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.535
The... the script.

05:43.568 --> 05:44.502
I sent you the script.

05:44.536 --> 05:45.503
Did you get it?

05:45.537 --> 05:46.072
Yes.

05:46.105 --> 05:48.741
Great.

05:48.774 --> 05:52.078
I didn't understand any of it.

05:53.713 --> 05:55.281
You didn't understand any of it.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.649
I find that hard to believe.

05:56.682 --> 05:58.117
Well, for starters,

05:58.150 --> 06:00.552
it's supposed to be
a World War I epic

06:00.585 --> 06:02.021
and you've turned it
into a romantic comedy

06:02.054 --> 06:05.024
that takes place over Zoom.

06:05.057 --> 06:06.726
Is this
because I made it diverse?

06:08.227 --> 06:10.763
Okay, you have a time-traveling
Douglas MacArthur

06:10.796 --> 06:12.798
that you've also turned
into a female character.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.133
And?

06:15.234 --> 06:16.902
Look,
your argument is not with me.

06:16.936 --> 06:18.037
I am for it!

06:18.070 --> 06:19.205
I am.

06:19.238 --> 06:22.241
Okay, well, if you're for it,
then I ask you once again

06:22.274 --> 06:23.175
what's wrong with that

06:23.209 --> 06:26.145
Women don't look hot
with corn cob pipes.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.246
I mean that's one.

06:27.279 --> 06:29.581
Ugh, that is such bullshit,
Noel, and you know that.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.252
Ah, that wasn't me.

06:33.285 --> 06:34.687
That was Ben Smut.

06:38.590 --> 06:41.694
Look, I'm on your side.

06:41.727 --> 06:42.661
I'm just a mess.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.596
No, you're not, Noel,
you're the producer.

06:44.630 --> 06:48.701
Yeah, and I won't be
if I send them this script.

06:50.736 --> 06:52.038
Okay.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.308
I'm gonna go out on a limb.

06:56.342 --> 06:58.844
You know what?
I might be wrong.

06:58.878 --> 06:59.912
Anna left.

06:59.945 --> 07:00.713
Alright.

07:00.746 --> 07:02.681
Which... that sucks.

07:04.016 --> 07:04.884
I get it.

07:04.917 --> 07:07.353
I can't believe
you would bring up Anna.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.990
What in the fuck
does this have to do with Anna?

07:11.023 --> 07:13.626
This isn't about Anna,
this is about progress.

07:13.659 --> 07:15.261
Did you actually moved on?
Yes, that is probably.

07:15.294 --> 07:16.695
I have actually moved on,

07:16.729 --> 07:19.231
I'm sort of interested
in someone else.

07:19.265 --> 07:20.666
What?

07:20.699 --> 07:22.735
Are you holding GD the F...

07:22.768 --> 07:23.669
What? Who is it?

07:23.702 --> 07:25.004
No, no, I'm not...

07:25.037 --> 07:26.604
Tell me.

07:26.639 --> 07:27.039
No.

07:27.840 --> 07:28.774
Cut it.

07:28.808 --> 07:30.242
Get your fucking down.

07:30.276 --> 07:31.710
Tell it, say it, who is it?

07:31.744 --> 07:32.912
Katie!

07:32.945 --> 07:34.980
It's Katie.

07:37.183 --> 07:38.117
What?

07:38.150 --> 07:38.784
That's funny?

07:38.818 --> 07:41.619
It is hilarious.

07:41.654 --> 07:45.724
I say
you have effin' got a shot!

07:45.758 --> 07:46.926
Oh, you do.

07:46.959 --> 07:50.362
You do, because your response
with your ridiculous laugh

07:50.396 --> 07:51.964
kind of...
kind of makes that response

07:51.997 --> 07:53.032
feel effing contrived.

07:53.065 --> 07:54.633
Okay, potty mouth.

07:54.667 --> 07:57.736
Hey, um,

07:57.770 --> 07:59.705
I am just saying
you should call her

08:01.006 --> 08:02.007
What the H?

08:02.041 --> 08:03.909
Okay, is this a pep talk?

08:03.943 --> 08:05.644
It's a pandemic pep talk.

08:05.678 --> 08:06.879
It's not good.

08:08.781 --> 08:11.616
Oh, f...- fu...
k... k... k... k... k... k... k.

08:12.785 --> 08:13.752
What?

08:13.786 --> 08:14.920
Andy's calling.

08:14.954 --> 08:17.056
Andy st... And...
studio Andy is calling?

08:17.089 --> 08:21.026
Yes, the one who has financed
the entire GD effin' movie.

08:21.060 --> 08:21.861
Andy.

08:21.894 --> 08:22.828
Okay, this is okay.

08:22.862 --> 08:23.662
This is good.

08:23.696 --> 08:24.563
Look, this is good.

08:24.597 --> 08:26.398
We can... I'm gonna...
I'm merging calls.

08:26.432 --> 08:27.266
Don't say anything
about the script.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.934
Yeah, say something
about the script.

08:28.968 --> 08:30.169
Noel,
he's gonna ask about the script.

08:30.202 --> 08:30.936
I'm gonna say something
about the script.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.837
I will do it.
You, let me talk.

08:32.871 --> 08:34.006
- I will talk.
- Fine.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.241
- I will talk.
- Fine.

08:35.274 --> 08:37.775
Hey, Andy!

08:37.809 --> 08:38.910
I was about to call you, man.

08:38.943 --> 08:40.412
Okay, cut this shit, Noel.

08:40.446 --> 08:42.780
When is my script
gonna be finished?

08:44.216 --> 08:47.019
Uh, that's great.

08:47.052 --> 08:48.020
Uh, I don't know if you noticed

08:48.053 --> 08:49.288
that Ben is on this call
as well.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.923
Did you no...
hey, say hello, Ben.

08:50.956 --> 08:53.159
Hi, Andy.
How're you doin'?

08:53.192 --> 08:55.094
You know, I would actually be
doing a hell of a lot better,

08:55.127 --> 08:57.830
Ben, if I knew when my script
was gonna be done.

08:57.863 --> 08:59.398
It's been three months.

08:59.431 --> 09:04.303
Yes, that... that's correct
and to be fair uh, you know,

09:04.336 --> 09:08.174
three months for a script is...
is a pretty quick turnaround.

09:08.207 --> 09:11.010
It was a quick turnaround
when we all had lives to lead.

09:11.043 --> 09:12.311
Now, we don't, right?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.413
We're all just at home.

09:14.446 --> 09:16.148
Right? Time is irrelevant.

09:16.182 --> 09:18.217
Yeah, well, about that...

09:18.250 --> 09:19.852
Do you guys
get your groceries delivered?

09:19.885 --> 09:20.986
I get mine delivered right?

09:21.020 --> 09:24.323
And every time I say,
"Green avocados, please. Green."

09:24.356 --> 09:25.891
- Definitely, yeah.
- Go green.

09:25.925 --> 09:26.792
Every time what do I get?

09:26.825 --> 09:28.260
I get brown avocados, ripe.

09:28.294 --> 09:30.262
Can't cook with ripe avocados.

09:30.296 --> 09:31.797
I'm learning how to cook.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.766
It's unbelievable.

09:33.799 --> 09:35.968
Uh, you know, it's uh...

09:36.001 --> 09:37.736
Okay, alright, I'm sorry...
sorry about that.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.972
Ev... it's...

09:40.005 --> 09:41.807
Alright, this thing gets to us
at times.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.842
Okay, look,
it's tough for everybody,

09:43.876 --> 09:44.777
I understand that.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.413
I understand that,
so in light of that,

09:47.446 --> 09:52.151
today, I am gonna
be your pal Andy, okay?

09:52.184 --> 09:55.321
I'm not gonna be asshole Andy,
I'll be your pal Andy, alright?

09:55.354 --> 09:58.257
But asshole Andy needs a script,

09:58.290 --> 10:03.262
so your pal Andy is asking,
"Ben, are we close?"

10:07.433 --> 10:08.934
Um...

10:08.968 --> 10:11.971
It's just a little...
a little polishing, yeah.

10:12.004 --> 10:13.372
Hmm, few... few minor tweaks.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.306
Yes, that's all it needs.

10:14.340 --> 10:15.274
A couple revisions.

10:15.307 --> 10:16.809
Uh, little... little things.

10:16.842 --> 10:17.810
Not a complete overhaul.

10:17.843 --> 10:18.877
Nothing major.

10:18.911 --> 10:22.014
Okay, alright, polishing.
Polishing.

10:22.047 --> 10:23.816
Who said pol... one of you guys
said "polishing".

10:23.849 --> 10:25.484
That means there's a draft,
right?

10:25.517 --> 10:26.518
That's all I need.

10:26.552 --> 10:29.488
I just need a draft
to see where we are, so...

10:29.521 --> 10:30.322
Yikes.

10:31.290 --> 10:34.059
Look, uh Andy um,

10:34.093 --> 10:35.527
if we could just get a couple
of more weeks,

10:35.561 --> 10:37.529
I've been giving Ben
some really stiff notes.

10:37.563 --> 10:40.065
No, shut up, please.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.367
Just please.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.271
Ben, you tell me straight.

10:45.304 --> 10:47.873
Andy, here's the thing.

10:49.508 --> 10:52.144
I think

10:52.177 --> 10:56.181
what this film needs
is a love story

10:56.215 --> 10:59.351
over Zoom and...

11:00.853 --> 11:06.125
I think what the studio
is asking is,

11:06.158 --> 11:09.395
to be frank, a little sexist

11:09.428 --> 11:11.230
and a little white.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.200
Okay, let me... let me...

11:17.136 --> 11:19.605
Let me just get this clear
just so... so I understand.

11:19.639 --> 11:22.141
You... you wanna
take my epic war movie...

11:22.174 --> 11:24.109
Hmm.

11:24.143 --> 11:26.211
And using Zoom,

11:26.245 --> 11:30.215
turn it into a white sexist
quarantine love story?

11:30.249 --> 11:32.618
Yes.

11:32.652 --> 11:34.920
No, wait, no, what?

11:34.953 --> 11:36.922
And Noel is this how you feel,
too?

11:36.955 --> 11:37.791
You know what I think?

11:37.823 --> 11:38.891
I think it's a little ironic
and funny

11:38.924 --> 11:39.793
that three white men

11:39.825 --> 11:41.093
are having this conversation
right now.

11:44.897 --> 11:49.301
Uh, but I'm thinking uh,
that uh, honestly,

11:49.335 --> 11:52.037
that uh, there's some truth
to what Ben is saying.

11:52.071 --> 11:53.605
You know what?

11:53.640 --> 11:55.174
I really thought
you guys were the right team

11:55.207 --> 11:56.442
for this movie.

12:03.215 --> 12:05.017
I'll call you back.

12:10.055 --> 12:11.223
Okay.

12:13.158 --> 12:15.294
That could have been worse.

12:16.663 --> 12:19.231
You know what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go find

12:19.264 --> 12:21.533
uh, the weed I have left
assuming

12:21.567 --> 12:26.004
that my wife hasn't found it
and thrown it away.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.440
Then I'm going to
Google the nearest soup kitchen.

12:28.474 --> 12:30.976
Okay,
that sounds a little dramatic.

12:31.009 --> 12:32.311
Yeah, well unemployment
is dramatic.

12:32.344 --> 12:33.245
It's very dramatic.

12:33.278 --> 12:35.948
Yeah, well,
also he hasn't fired us yet.

12:35.981 --> 12:37.015
Have you considered that?

12:37.049 --> 12:40.319
So you know?

12:40.352 --> 12:41.520
We did do the right thing.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.588
Yeah.

12:43.522 --> 12:45.658
I mean if history
has taught us anything

12:45.692 --> 12:46.959
it's that people
who do the right thing

12:46.992 --> 12:48.127
don't end up on the gallows.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.997
Alright, well, I... look,
I'll send him the script right?

12:52.030 --> 12:53.198
Let's just have him read it.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.033
What if he changes his mind?

12:55.067 --> 12:56.468
I think it's worth a shot.

12:56.502 --> 12:58.070
Let him get his eyes on it.

12:58.103 --> 12:59.271
Sure.

13:00.205 --> 13:01.240
Go ahead.

13:01.273 --> 13:02.975
Uh, go for it.

13:03.008 --> 13:04.510
I'm gonna go.

13:04.543 --> 13:07.312
Uh, I... I mean
I think I heard one of my kids

13:07.346 --> 13:08.947
destroying something expensive

13:08.981 --> 13:12.217
I will now
not be able to replace.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.219
Then, we'll talk later.

13:19.591 --> 13:22.161
I hope you know
what you're doin', asswipe.

13:37.309 --> 13:38.110
Everyone is talking

13:38.143 --> 13:39.077
about what they're doing
in lockdown

13:39.111 --> 13:42.247
and I'm just like,
"Who the fuck cares?"

13:42.281 --> 13:43.549
I wanna think about
what we're going to do

13:43.582 --> 13:46.452
when this is all over, right?

13:46.485 --> 13:50.690
Like I miss going to
like Elton John concerts.

13:50.723 --> 13:52.659
I've never actually been
to an Elton John concert,

13:52.692 --> 13:54.526
but like I miss the feeling
of feeling

13:54.560 --> 13:58.030
like I'm missing out
on something.

13:58.063 --> 14:00.132
You know, what else I miss?

14:00.165 --> 14:02.000
Monogamy.

14:02.034 --> 14:04.069
Because like then at least,
you're not having sex

14:04.102 --> 14:05.504
because you don't want to.

14:07.573 --> 14:11.176
Hey, do you know how many things
had to happen exactly right

14:11.210 --> 14:14.012
for us to admit?

14:15.047 --> 14:16.248
Do you?

14:16.281 --> 14:19.652
I mean if one thing
had been different,

14:19.686 --> 14:21.520
we could have
spent the rest of our lives

14:25.290 --> 14:26.726
Never knowing...

14:28.360 --> 14:30.362
The other...

14:34.266 --> 14:35.735
Existed.

14:47.145 --> 14:48.180
Why?

14:49.581 --> 14:51.483
Like why would you send that in?

15:06.365 --> 15:09.268
Hey, it's over.

15:09.301 --> 15:11.203
I know Tom is having an affair.

15:11.236 --> 15:12.471
I'm good, thanks.

15:12.504 --> 15:13.572
How are you?

15:13.605 --> 15:14.774
So great.

15:14.807 --> 15:17.209
Are we still talkin' about this?

15:17.242 --> 15:19.444
I thought you already knew
that Tom was having an affair.

15:19.478 --> 15:22.514
Now I know that I know
and I'm right about what I know.

15:22.548 --> 15:24.516
And what do you know?

15:24.550 --> 15:26.385
That Tom is having an affair.

15:26.418 --> 15:28.387
I meant why do you think that?

15:28.420 --> 15:30.657
Because he's... he's bein' weird.

15:30.690 --> 15:33.425
Well, then you have
all the evidence you need.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.828
He got fired,
we can't pay our bills,

15:35.862 --> 15:37.864
he won't let me call my dad
to help us,

15:37.897 --> 15:42.167
he refuses to even consider
New York as an alternative,

15:42.200 --> 15:44.202
and every time I bring it up,
he gets this...

15:44.236 --> 15:47.205
This weird distant look
in his eyes.

15:49.207 --> 15:50.643
I'm... I'm sorry, Ella.

15:50.677 --> 15:54.246
I'm... I'm just
makin' this all about me.

15:54.279 --> 15:56.548
Okay, listen, Chloe,

15:56.582 --> 15:58.517
we both know
I'm not gonna sit here

15:58.550 --> 16:00.218
and give you
the sugar-coated reach-around

16:00.252 --> 16:02.154
about how
it's all gonna be fine.

16:02.187 --> 16:05.290
like 7 out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

16:05.324 --> 16:06.425
This is helping.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.560
I'm so glad I called.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.897
I think
you might be overreacting.

16:10.930 --> 16:12.464
How?

16:12.497 --> 16:15.635
You have a hunch, that's all.

16:15.668 --> 16:18.537
So you don't think
he's cheating on me?

16:18.570 --> 16:20.372
Has he told you the big lie yet?

16:20.405 --> 16:22.875
The big lie?

16:22.909 --> 16:25.477
I've caught him in a few lies
here and there, but...

16:25.510 --> 16:28.213
No, no, I'm not talkin'
about the little white lies.

16:28.246 --> 16:30.382
I'm I'm not even talkin'
about the inconsistencies.

16:30.415 --> 16:32.852
I'm talkin' about the lie.

16:32.885 --> 16:34.721
The lie
that just doesn't add up,

16:34.754 --> 16:36.789
it just comes out of left field.

16:36.823 --> 16:38.725
Like what?

16:38.758 --> 16:39.659
I don't know.

16:39.692 --> 16:41.526
You'll know it when you hear it.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.797
It'll be one of those things
that changes the dynamic.

16:44.831 --> 16:46.431
Something that probably
makes you feel shitty

16:46.465 --> 16:47.499
about being suspicious

16:47.532 --> 16:49.501
while he buys some more time
to figure shit out.

16:49.534 --> 16:51.269
That's the big lie.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.206
And when that happens,
then you know for sure.

16:55.642 --> 16:58.443
Well, that hasn't happened yet.

16:58.477 --> 16:59.946
Is that what happened
with you and Nick?

16:59.979 --> 17:04.549
Nick was the big lie,
the entire relationship.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.385
But if that hasn't happened
with you and Tom,

17:06.417 --> 17:07.887
then who knows?

17:07.920 --> 17:09.888
Maybe it will work out.

17:09.922 --> 17:14.291
And for you,
I really hope it does, Chloe.

17:14.326 --> 17:16.228
I should
let you get back to work.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.330
Romantic comedies
don't cast themselves.

17:19.364 --> 17:22.233
Yeah, not the shitty ones.

17:23.268 --> 17:26.405
I am feeling
an exceptional amount of angst.

17:26.438 --> 17:27.271
Exceptional amount.

17:27.305 --> 17:28.941
That's why I'm walking,

17:28.975 --> 17:30.609
getting exercise
or whatever you guys do.

17:30.643 --> 17:32.377
This is just so ugh!

17:32.411 --> 17:33.311
Movin' around.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.213
I wanna talk
about something else, too,

17:35.247 --> 17:37.884
that's related
and also really annoying,

17:37.917 --> 17:40.252
which is the fact
that um, isolation has

17:40.285 --> 17:42.755
just about killed dating.

17:42.789 --> 17:44.256
Just fuckin' beheaded
that bitch,

17:44.289 --> 17:46.258
get her a true crime podcast,
'cause she dead,

17:46.291 --> 17:48.460
and I used to just be able
to go have sex with strangers,

17:48.493 --> 17:50.262
and drink at some shitty bar
or whatever,

17:50.295 --> 17:54.299
not necessarily in that order,
but now I'm just swiping,

17:54.332 --> 17:55.835
starting up
long-distance romances

17:55.868 --> 17:58.303
with people who are literally
like in the next suburb over.

17:58.336 --> 17:59.972
It's kinda disgusting
and hilarious.

18:00.006 --> 18:01.708
Like what the actual fuck
are we doing?

18:01.741 --> 18:04.010
Full disclosure,
I'm currently in two...

18:04.043 --> 18:07.379
Count 'em two, isolationships,
as we speak, not to brag.

18:07.412 --> 18:09.649
And yeah, you know,

18:09.682 --> 18:10.750
I don't know
if you guys know this,

18:10.783 --> 18:13.019
but that shit goes from zero
to a 100 in intensity

18:13.052 --> 18:14.419
like that.

18:14.453 --> 18:15.855
I know what you're thinking.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.657
If I'm so horny,
why don't I just watch porn?

18:17.690 --> 18:21.259
Uh, I do and yes,
I watch Asian porn, okay?

18:21.293 --> 18:22.594
Or as I call it "porn".

18:22.628 --> 18:23.796
What are we talking about?

18:23.830 --> 18:25.497
Oh, yeah.

18:25.530 --> 18:29.635
So to answer the main question,
"Are isolationships legit?"

18:29.669 --> 18:31.369
I think my answer is maybe.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.906
The positive
and the negative of it is

18:33.940 --> 18:35.574
you really have
to get to know each other

18:35.607 --> 18:37.542
before you head to bone town.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.577
That's...

18:38.610 --> 18:39.679
That's true, right?

18:39.712 --> 18:41.848
'Cause what do you have...
what are you gonna do

18:41.881 --> 18:43.916
other than just like talk
about your feelings.

18:43.950 --> 18:45.651
Really get it... I wanna know

18:45.685 --> 18:47.887
how your dead grandma
makes you feel, you know?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.554
Okay, this is...
it's getting weird.

18:49.588 --> 18:50.422
I should stop.

18:50.455 --> 18:52.491
Alright, Mi Cha out.

18:52.524 --> 18:56.696
My apologies,
fellow hunker-downers.

18:56.729 --> 19:02.068
We were experiencing some
technical difficulties,

19:02.101 --> 19:03.703
but thanks
to a mythical creature

19:03.736 --> 19:08.741
named "Love Bunny",
we have been restored.

19:08.775 --> 19:12.645
So sit back, relax,

19:12.678 --> 19:18.517
and let us once again pacify
your quarantine anxieties.

19:18.550 --> 19:22.655
This next segment
I love to call

19:22.688 --> 19:25.691
"secret fornicator".

19:29.327 --> 19:32.364

I like them less than lonely ♪

19:34.000 --> 19:35.935

Hey.

19:50.817 --> 19:52.384
Hey you.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.418
Oh.

19:53.451 --> 19:54.086
Oh-oh.

19:55.087 --> 19:56.656
Hmm.

19:56.689 --> 19:58.858
Are you in the guest bedroom?

19:58.891 --> 20:01.027
No.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.062
I...
I can clearly see you hiding.

20:03.095 --> 20:04.630
I disagree.

20:05.564 --> 20:07.599
Why are you whispering?

20:07.633 --> 20:09.902
I just like the way it sounds.

20:09.936 --> 20:10.803
Okay.

20:10.837 --> 20:13.139
Well, kids are
givin' you a hard time?

20:13.172 --> 20:16.742
No, why... why...
why would you say that?

20:16.776 --> 20:18.044
Oh, I don't know.

20:18.077 --> 20:20.880
Maybe because you're hiding
like a troll

20:20.913 --> 20:22.648
in the guest bedroom
with a full glass of wine

20:22.682 --> 20:23.649
in the middle of the day.

20:23.683 --> 20:24.349
Incorrect.

20:24.382 --> 20:26.152
This is actually apple juice.

20:26.185 --> 20:28.120
Hmm, really?

20:28.154 --> 20:31.858
Yeah, well, because number one,
I don't drink

20:31.891 --> 20:35.460
while I'm watching our children.

20:35.493 --> 20:41.399
And B, they are in the kitchen,
where the wine is.

20:41.433 --> 20:42.001
Got it.

20:42.034 --> 20:42.835
Don't tease me.

20:45.204 --> 20:46.504
How's the writing coming along?

20:46.538 --> 20:49.507
Mm, so good.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.643
I actually just finished one.

20:50.676 --> 20:51.476
Yeah?

20:51.509 --> 20:54.680
Yes,
right after I stopped our son

20:54.714 --> 20:56.082
from peeing over the balcony

20:56.115 --> 20:59.085
and into the neighbor's
succulent garden.

20:59.118 --> 21:00.418
No.

21:00.452 --> 21:01.654
No, that didn't happen.

21:01.687 --> 21:02.587
Stop.

21:02.621 --> 21:03.689
Oh, that happened.

21:04.857 --> 21:05.958
Oh.

21:05.992 --> 21:07.559
Full day over here.

21:07.592 --> 21:08.661
Yeah.

21:08.694 --> 21:10.630
I know it's tough, though.

21:10.663 --> 21:11.764
But never mind.

21:11.797 --> 21:13.498
What uh,
what's going on with you?

21:13.531 --> 21:14.566
How are you?

21:14.599 --> 21:16.434
You know, tired.

21:16.468 --> 21:17.602
Mm.

21:17.637 --> 21:19.171
Lonely without you.

21:19.205 --> 21:20.773
Mm.

21:20.806 --> 21:23.843
Is lonely a code for horny?

21:23.876 --> 21:25.610
Yes.

21:25.645 --> 21:26.712
1000%, yes.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.016
Wait,
why aren't you at the hospital?

21:30.049 --> 21:32.018
I thought you had to work today.

21:32.051 --> 21:36.656
Um, yeah, I... I've just
finished up a 36-hour shift.

21:36.689 --> 21:38.824
And I'm sitting here complaining

21:38.858 --> 21:41.994
about how I can't
control our 4-year-old.

21:42.028 --> 21:44.230
And you're basically
raising our kids without me.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.463
No.

21:45.497 --> 21:47.233
Yeah.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.769
I mean what we've been here
for three months,

21:49.802 --> 21:51.938
we've been apart
for the last two.

21:51.971 --> 21:55.708
For better or worse, right?

21:55.741 --> 22:00.680
And you are a fucking hero,
by the way.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.786
Damn, I miss you.

22:06.819 --> 22:08.620
I miss you.

22:10.756 --> 22:13.092
I miss the little things, too,
you know?

22:13.125 --> 22:15.828
Like the movies and dinner.

22:15.861 --> 22:17.096
Well, let's do it.

22:17.129 --> 22:18.731
How are we gonna do that?

22:18.764 --> 22:20.633
There's one thing
this mom can do.

22:20.666 --> 22:24.569
It is get our kids
to bed incredibly fucking early.

22:24.602 --> 22:27.206
Oh, is that so?

22:27.239 --> 22:28.908
And how early are we talkin'?

22:28.941 --> 22:32.178
Oh, you know,
like before sunset early.

22:32.211 --> 22:35.547
Oh, I like a woman with skills.

22:35.580 --> 22:36.548
I like where this is headed.

22:36.581 --> 22:37.650
Yeah?

22:37.683 --> 22:38.918
Yeah.

22:40.019 --> 22:41.087
Oh shit!

22:41.120 --> 22:42.888
What?

22:42.922 --> 22:45.257
Oh, my brother is calling.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.126
Yay.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.593
Brace yourself.

22:50.663 --> 22:53.132
Hey, Jodi,
what can I do for you?

22:53.165 --> 22:54.834
Lexi.

22:54.867 --> 22:57.770
Lexi, I have
a very serious question for you.

22:57.803 --> 22:58.671
What's up, Nonny?

22:58.704 --> 22:59.672
Hey, Jodi.

22:59.705 --> 23:01.207
Uh, this isn't really
a good time, you know?

23:01.240 --> 23:02.808
Why not?

23:02.842 --> 23:03.843
Is that your question?

23:03.876 --> 23:06.145
No, I have bigger fish to fry.

23:06.178 --> 23:07.545
God, I hate that expression.

23:07.579 --> 23:08.848
Hmm.

23:08.881 --> 23:12.218
Lexi, Nonny, brace yourselves.

23:12.251 --> 23:13.719
For what?

23:13.753 --> 23:17.622
I have figured out
the space-time continuum.

23:17.656 --> 23:19.091
Didn't Einstein already do that?

23:19.125 --> 23:23.129
Well, yeah, but I mean
I figured out the next part.

23:23.162 --> 23:25.097
See, there's all these
like dimensions

23:25.131 --> 23:26.699
and like
transcendental highways,

23:26.732 --> 23:28.267
like Bill and Ted kinda sorta...

23:28.300 --> 23:29.902
You know what?

23:29.935 --> 23:31.737
It's kinda complicated
to explain.

23:31.771 --> 23:33.672
Mm, I mean I am a doctor.

23:33.706 --> 23:35.741
Yeah, but I mean
you ain't a scientist.

23:35.775 --> 23:37.076
Neither are you, Jodi.

23:37.109 --> 23:38.344
Semantics.

23:38.377 --> 23:40.146
To get back
to my original point...

23:40.179 --> 23:42.281
Yes, what is the point, Jodi?

23:42.314 --> 23:44.616
I figured out a way
to time travel

23:47.420 --> 23:48.954
How do we share the same DNA?

23:48.988 --> 23:49.889
I know.

23:49.922 --> 23:51.857
I know that it sounds crazy,

23:51.891 --> 23:55.194
But see, this next part's gonna
tie it all together for you.

23:55.227 --> 23:59.231
All I need
is this special tool,

23:59.265 --> 24:02.034
which brings me
to my original question.

24:02.068 --> 24:05.171
You bein' in New York City
where shit is,

24:05.204 --> 24:06.972
can you get me...

24:09.175 --> 24:10.608
...a flux capacitor?

24:13.179 --> 24:14.612
What?

24:14.647 --> 24:15.781
Okay, you know what?

24:15.815 --> 24:17.917
I'ma bring Glen in on this,
he can explain everything.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.151
Oh, it's so good.

24:19.185 --> 24:20.019
Maybe it'll work.

24:20.052 --> 24:21.287
Of course, it works.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.689
It's a time machine.

24:27.326 --> 24:29.061
Jodi, what's up?

24:29.095 --> 24:31.363
Glen,
you handsome son of a bitch.

24:31.397 --> 24:32.198
Oh, what?

24:32.231 --> 24:34.667
We got a whole group
goin' on here.

24:34.700 --> 24:35.734
Lexi, is that you?

24:35.768 --> 24:37.036
Hey, Glen.

24:37.069 --> 24:39.305
Hey, you still sein'
that cute mix chick or what?

24:39.338 --> 24:41.073
Yep, that's... that's me.

24:41.107 --> 24:42.374
Uh, the other person

24:42.408 --> 24:44.243
and the only mixed chick
on the call with you.

24:44.276 --> 24:48.080
Holy shit, I didn't...
there you are.

24:48.114 --> 24:49.148
Hey, how you doin'?

24:49.181 --> 24:51.250
Glen focus.

24:51.283 --> 24:52.885
Now,
I'm tryin' to explain to them

24:52.918 --> 24:54.687
the importance
of the flux capacitor,

24:54.720 --> 24:56.388
but they just ain't getting it.

24:56.422 --> 24:58.057
So could you just
please do some explainin'

24:58.090 --> 24:59.158
like you done to me?

24:59.191 --> 25:01.260
Honestly,
it's pretty simple guys.

25:01.293 --> 25:04.730
Alright uh,
we need a flex capacitor,

25:04.763 --> 25:06.732
because it only takes
1.21 gigawatts

25:06.765 --> 25:08.134
of electrical power to operate,

25:08.167 --> 25:11.337
which can easily be done

25:11.370 --> 25:15.107
by using a compact
weapons-grade plutonium-239

25:15.141 --> 25:17.810
nuclear fission reactor, Okay?

25:17.843 --> 25:20.980
When the energy pulses
through the flex capacitor,

25:21.013 --> 25:23.349
it creates a massive flow
of energy,

25:23.382 --> 25:24.483
which does two things.

25:24.517 --> 25:29.021
One, it turns positive energy
into negative energy.

25:29.054 --> 25:32.458
And two, it opens up a wormhole
that's accessible

25:32.491 --> 25:35.694
at 88 miles an hour.

25:37.296 --> 25:38.364
I know I don't
have to tell you guys

25:38.397 --> 25:39.633
what I just explained,

25:39.665 --> 25:44.436
but basically, a flex capacitor
makes time travel possible.

25:44.470 --> 25:48.073
Wow.

25:48.107 --> 25:51.310
So is there gonna be a
DeLorean on standby?

25:51.343 --> 25:52.912
What's that supposed to mean?

25:52.945 --> 25:54.914
It means your buddy here
just explained

25:54.947 --> 25:57.883
how the time machine works
in the movie Back to the Future.

25:57.917 --> 26:01.253
Yeah, no fucking shit,
it's a cinematic masterpiece!

26:01.287 --> 26:05.057
That... that was from a movie?

26:05.090 --> 26:09.328
But is the flux capacitor
a real thing?

26:09.361 --> 26:10.362
I can't even believe
you asked me

26:10.396 --> 26:11.463
that goddamn question.

26:12.364 --> 26:13.399
You've never seen
Back to the Future?

26:13.432 --> 26:15.334
What have we been talkin' about
the whole time?

26:15.367 --> 26:16.969
I've never even heard
of Back to the Future!

26:18.337 --> 26:19.305
Oh my God.

26:19.338 --> 26:21.307
I mean I don't come here, guys,

26:21.340 --> 26:24.843
bringing information
to... that can change the world

26:24.877 --> 26:27.346
to just be snuffed at like...
like... like... like...

26:27.379 --> 26:29.481
Like... like... like I'm a joke.

26:29.515 --> 26:31.083
But I mean it's not real?

26:31.116 --> 26:32.484
You're tellin' me it's not real?

26:32.518 --> 26:34.486
You're tellin' me
I imagined the entire thing?

26:34.520 --> 26:36.255
I never saw the movie!

26:36.288 --> 26:39.091
The... the capac fusion capac...
I don't...

26:39.124 --> 26:40.359
this is really hard to explain.

26:40.392 --> 26:42.294
It's not a real thing!

26:42.328 --> 26:44.063
Why the hell do you think
that'd work, Glen?

26:44.096 --> 26:46.031
B...

26:48.400 --> 26:51.937
Because it worked in the movie!

26:51.971 --> 26:52.871
Damn.

26:52.905 --> 26:54.873
Uh... ugh.

26:54.907 --> 26:56.275
You got a Redbox?

26:56.308 --> 26:57.476
Go to a Redbox.

26:57.509 --> 26:58.645
I'm sorry.

26:58.678 --> 27:01.413
Obviously, all fiction is based
in some sort of reality.

27:01.447 --> 27:03.182
You are correct on that, Glen.

27:03.215 --> 27:05.818
Thank you and I appreciate you
acknowledging that.

27:05.851 --> 27:07.353
God, my phone's about to die.

27:07.386 --> 27:08.554
Let me get my charger
and I'll be right...

27:10.155 --> 27:11.357
Awesome.

27:23.168 --> 27:26.438
I... I... I feel like we're
near the end of this interaction

27:26.472 --> 27:30.509
and um, I feel so awkward,
'cause I...

27:31.377 --> 27:32.444
I don't know what to say.

27:32.478 --> 27:34.046
You can just go now.

27:34.079 --> 27:36.482
I think we've made this
sufficiently strange

27:36.515 --> 27:37.916
for my sister.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.152
Jodi, I mean... but...

27:40.185 --> 27:42.087
I...

27:42.121 --> 27:45.090
You'll let me know about the
flex capacitor, though, right?

27:45.124 --> 27:46.859
It's not a real thing, Glen.

27:46.892 --> 27:48.560
There is no capacitor.

27:48.594 --> 27:49.528
It...

27:49.561 --> 27:51.096
Don't get upset.

27:51.130 --> 27:53.232
God dammit!

27:56.468 --> 27:58.937
I... I do wanna apologize
for some of my actions

27:58.971 --> 28:01.407
and how they came across,
because I do love you

28:01.440 --> 28:03.075
as... as a friend.

28:03.108 --> 28:04.376
I mean we're gonna try it,
right,

28:04.410 --> 28:06.445
because we... we believe and...

28:07.647 --> 28:10.549
I love you, too, uh, as a...
as a friend.

28:10.582 --> 28:12.217
Well, of course,
we're gonna try.

28:12.251 --> 28:13.619
Yes, I fucking love it!

28:13.653 --> 28:14.953
And you tell those other fuck
um...

28:14.987 --> 28:17.323
Glen.

28:17.356 --> 28:19.892
Sorry, Lexi, I didn't...
I didn't know you were still on,

28:19.925 --> 28:21.894
but...
but it was good to see you.

28:21.927 --> 28:23.395
Somethin' like that.

28:23.429 --> 28:24.563
Bye, guys.

28:27.399 --> 28:29.935
Sorry, I ruined your call.

28:29.968 --> 28:31.403
It's just Glen, and me,
and the band.

28:31.437 --> 28:32.639
You know how it is?

28:32.672 --> 28:33.773
It's like we broke up
after we did

28:33.807 --> 28:36.975
that complete tribute album
of Toad the Wet Sprocket,

28:37.009 --> 28:38.110
'cause you know,
he wanted to throw

28:38.143 --> 28:39.878
Hey, Jealousy in the play mix

28:39.912 --> 28:41.447
and I just like,
"That's not a Toad song."

28:41.480 --> 28:43.048
No, that's alright.

28:43.082 --> 28:44.283
How's mama doing?

28:44.316 --> 28:45.417
She's good.

28:45.451 --> 28:46.485
I got her a new Rascal.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.354
You know, the things
they ride around at Kroger.

28:48.387 --> 28:49.555
She's just been
puttin' around everywhere

28:49.588 --> 28:51.190
on that thing.

28:51.223 --> 28:53.192
She's still mad at you for
moving to New York City, though.

28:53.225 --> 28:54.059
But you know mama.

28:54.093 --> 28:55.160
Hell,
she ain't mad about somethin',

28:55.194 --> 28:56.128
she ain't happy.

28:56.161 --> 28:57.296
I know that's true.

28:57.329 --> 28:59.131
You tell her I love her?

28:59.164 --> 29:00.999
You know I will.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.434
I miss you.

29:02.468 --> 29:04.069
Hey, I miss you, too.

29:04.103 --> 29:05.971
Alright, I'm gonna get.

29:06.004 --> 29:07.339
I'll see you later, peanut.

29:07.373 --> 29:08.507
Alright, bye.

29:11.276 --> 29:12.511
Are you still there?

29:14.012 --> 29:15.447
Yes, I'm still here.

29:16.716 --> 29:19.284
Okay, so are you gonna
answer my question?

29:19.318 --> 29:21.086
What the fuck do you think?

29:21.120 --> 29:22.287
What is that supposed to mean?

29:22.321 --> 29:23.522
I don't know what that means.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.591
It means
exactly what you think it means!

29:25.624 --> 29:26.693
What the fuck do you think
it means?

29:26.726 --> 29:28.093
I don't know.

29:28.127 --> 29:30.162
I need you to fucking tell me.

29:30.195 --> 29:31.196
Fuck!

29:31.230 --> 29:32.398
You left your email signed in
on my computer,

29:32.431 --> 29:34.099
you dumb fuck!

29:34.133 --> 29:37.302
You fucked Suzy Gumenik,
idiot!

29:38.203 --> 29:40.038
So fucking pressure me
for an answer.

29:40.072 --> 29:41.173
Like you don't have
the patience...

29:41.206 --> 29:42.074
If you fucking listen
one fucking time.

29:42.107 --> 29:43.041
To wait for me to consider

29:43.075 --> 29:43.743
whether or not
I wanna spent another second

29:43.777 --> 29:45.411
with a piece of shit like you!

29:45.444 --> 29:46.412
drunk.

29:46.445 --> 29:48.280
And don't act like you
didn't fuck Chris Roolin

29:48.313 --> 29:49.248
at the fucking
New Year's Eve party.

29:49.281 --> 29:50.516
So what if I did?
So what if I did?

29:50.549 --> 29:53.653
It was after we were separated
and way after you fucked Suzy.

29:53.686 --> 29:54.620
So you're one to talk!

29:54.654 --> 29:55.655
So we both fucked up!

29:55.688 --> 29:56.823
And the thing
that pisses me off the most is,

29:56.856 --> 30:00.559
you had the gall to fucking act
like I was a crazy bitch

30:00.592 --> 30:02.995
when you were the one who was
already acting suspicious

30:03.028 --> 30:05.497
and I was right all along!

30:05.531 --> 30:08.500
Okay, so what?

30:08.534 --> 30:12.070
Are we just...
we're just done now?

30:12.104 --> 30:15.240
Yeah,
we were done a long time ago.

30:25.083 --> 30:26.452
That one felt really good.

30:26.485 --> 30:27.519
I would never wanna divorce you.

30:29.121 --> 30:30.422
Um, when's your audition again?

30:30.456 --> 30:31.423
Tomorrow.

30:31.457 --> 30:32.624
You're gonna nail it, dude.

30:32.659 --> 30:34.393
No, no, this dialogue, though.

30:35.695 --> 30:36.763
I feel like everybody's tryin'
to be the marriage story now.

30:36.796 --> 30:38.997
Actually, are you sure
you wanna be the black dude

30:39.031 --> 30:40.165
who cheats?

30:40.199 --> 30:41.533
It just seems so cliché.

30:42.568 --> 30:44.269
I'm runnin' out of options.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.138
I'm sorry.

30:46.171 --> 30:48.607
Uh, it's not funny.

30:48.641 --> 30:52.211
So how is the music?

30:52.244 --> 30:53.245
Oh, stop.

30:53.278 --> 30:54.313
That's not funny.

30:54.346 --> 30:56.615
No. I'm just... I'm... I'm asking
trying to shift.

30:58.283 --> 31:01.453
Uh, I'm blocked up, dude,
I can't write shit.

31:01.487 --> 31:03.422
Oh, well,
you know what you should do?

31:03.455 --> 31:05.792
You should just get unblocked.

31:05.825 --> 31:08.427
Oh, well, thank you
for the pro tip, sir.

31:11.196 --> 31:12.598
How's your mom?

31:12.632 --> 31:17.135
Um, she is actually I d...
um, I actually don't know.

31:17.169 --> 31:19.605
I'm not gonna lie.

31:19.639 --> 31:21.641
Wouldn't have been
your dad's birthday this week?

31:25.110 --> 31:27.346
And that is my cue.

31:27.379 --> 31:29.147
Dude, just call her

31:29.181 --> 31:31.483
I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know.

31:31.517 --> 31:33.151
Come on.

31:33.185 --> 31:34.152
Bye, Anna.

31:38.423 --> 31:41.694
Hey,
things are weird out there right now.

31:41.728 --> 31:43.195
Am I right?

31:43.228 --> 31:46.699
Miss your mom, your dad,
boyfriend girlfriend.

31:46.733 --> 31:47.700
That's cool.

31:47.734 --> 31:49.201
No shame in it.

31:49.234 --> 31:52.604
Everything's gonna be alright,
alright, alright.

31:52.639 --> 31:54.139
That's why I'm here.

31:54.172 --> 31:56.141
Look at these guys.

31:56.174 --> 31:59.144
Hmm, I bet you're wonderin'
if I can fly.

31:59.177 --> 32:00.479
I can't.

32:00.512 --> 32:04.516
Because Matthew
McAlicorn says "you deserve wings".

32:04.550 --> 32:07.586
Virtually, of course.

that the difference

32:16.696 --> 32:20.499
between a epidemic
and a pandemic

32:20.532 --> 32:24.871
is that a pandemic
has a passport.

32:24.904 --> 32:28.775
It made me laugh at first.

32:28.808 --> 32:32.277
It is less funny to me now.

as I thought about our

32:43.656 --> 32:48.795
unendin' aptitude
to transcend as a species.

32:51.296 --> 32:56.602
I intend to just press play
and listen with you all,

32:56.636 --> 33:02.474
so that my soul and my sense
is made to be scintillate.

33:04.877 --> 33:07.814

You can't possibly
have something

33:23.328 --> 33:24.631
to bitch about already.

33:24.664 --> 33:26.298
I have so much to bitch about,

33:26.331 --> 33:27.834
but I think
I'll leave that to you

33:27.867 --> 33:29.267
for the both of us.

33:29.301 --> 33:30.870
Ooh, how was your uh,
audition today?

33:30.903 --> 33:31.838
It was fine.

33:31.871 --> 33:33.138
Oh, no, what am I saying?

33:33.171 --> 33:36.508
It was absolutely fucking awful,
but my next one will be better.

33:36.541 --> 33:37.710
Is that... you drinking whiskey?

33:37.744 --> 33:41.213
No, I am pouring whiskey.

33:41.246 --> 33:42.381
Now, I'm drinking whiskey.

33:42.982 --> 33:43.650
It's like 2:00 p.m.

33:43.683 --> 33:44.483
I'm sorry.

33:44.516 --> 33:45.652
Do you not also live
on this Earth

33:45.685 --> 33:47.486
where sex has become obsolete

33:47.519 --> 33:48.755
and time no longer
has any meaning

33:48.788 --> 33:49.889
or is that just me?

33:49.922 --> 33:53.191
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna punish my liver

33:53.225 --> 33:54.459
for the sins of Trump's...

33:54.493 --> 33:55.728
No need to finish that sentence.

33:55.762 --> 33:59.498
This is whiskey, not bitch juice
or whatever.

33:59.531 --> 34:01.533
I remember last time we went out
drinking together,

34:01.566 --> 34:04.403
uh, I returned home
to my bedroom doing 180s

34:04.436 --> 34:06.304
and then
you had mild indigestion

34:06.338 --> 34:08.975
from all the sugar inside
of your hard lemonade.

34:10.308 --> 34:11.476
It tastes better.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.378
How is Melanie?

34:13.411 --> 34:14.346
What's her name?

34:14.379 --> 34:15.213
Huh?

34:15.246 --> 34:16.313
Hmm, done.

34:16.348 --> 34:17.248
Nada, it's over.

34:17.282 --> 34:18.216
Already?

34:18.250 --> 34:18.784
She was cute.

34:18.818 --> 34:19.918
She was very cute.

34:19.952 --> 34:21.721
She also had my face printed
onto one of her pillows

34:21.754 --> 34:22.989
by our second date.

34:23.022 --> 34:24.222
Yikes.

34:24.255 --> 34:25.658
Luckily, quarantine swooped in

34:25.692 --> 34:27.827
and saved me
from that shit show.

34:27.860 --> 34:31.263
Well,
you will find someone else.

34:31.295 --> 34:33.632
That's what I'm supposed to say,
right?

34:33.666 --> 34:35.400
Maybe, I don't know.

34:35.434 --> 34:36.703
I definitely don't think
I'm ready

34:36.735 --> 34:38.335
for one of your isolationships.

34:38.370 --> 34:39.404
Sure you are.

34:39.438 --> 34:41.841
All you hopeless romantics
are cocked and loaded.

34:41.873 --> 34:43.009
That sounded very sexual.

34:43.042 --> 34:44.342
It was.

34:44.376 --> 34:45.310
I don't know.

34:45.342 --> 34:48.413
I... what Grace and I had
was real, you know?

34:48.447 --> 34:49.748
I'm sorta just waiting
for that spark again.

34:49.782 --> 34:50.683
A spark?

34:50.717 --> 34:51.583
Ooh, what is this?

34:51.616 --> 34:53.719
A Ken Kwapis movie?

34:53.753 --> 34:56.487
You and Grace broke up
like months ago.

34:56.521 --> 34:57.924
Time to get over it, Paul.

34:59.092 --> 35:01.861
In a love connection,
I mean that's a nice thought,

35:01.894 --> 35:03.863
uh, but this is the real world.

35:03.896 --> 35:05.732
You should be using this
as an opportunity

35:05.765 --> 35:09.434
to use your way back
into the dating world.

35:09.468 --> 35:10.636
Maybe you're right.

35:10.670 --> 35:11.470
Of course, I'm right.

35:12.839 --> 35:14.741
Ooh, but before you do that,
make sure you brush up

35:14.774 --> 35:16.909
on Mi Cha's quick tips
for millennialships

35:16.943 --> 35:18.911
on the blog.

35:18.945 --> 35:21.748
Actually,
last Thursday's article

35:21.781 --> 35:23.315
you'd find very interesting.

35:23.348 --> 35:24.684
Is that that's the one
where you talk about

35:24.717 --> 35:26.551
how to talk your girlfriend
into a threesome?

35:27.720 --> 35:28.955
So you do read the blog.

35:28.988 --> 35:29.956
Okay.

35:29.989 --> 35:31.623
I don't see how that helps me
at this stage.

35:31.657 --> 35:32.792
You gotta
lay down the table early,

35:32.825 --> 35:34.694
you know,
make sure they're open-minded.

35:34.727 --> 35:36.662
That is terrible advice.

35:36.696 --> 35:38.631
No.

35:38.664 --> 35:39.966
Can you remind me
how many threesomes

35:39.999 --> 35:41.667
that you've actually had?

35:41.701 --> 35:44.971
Okay, this is not about me,
alright?

35:45.004 --> 35:47.572
And I don't need a third
to eat box

35:47.606 --> 35:49.474
if I like the box.

35:49.508 --> 35:52.611
Alright, I...
I will make a mental note

35:52.645 --> 35:54.446
of your suggestion.

35:54.479 --> 35:56.048
Well, I should... I should go.

35:56.082 --> 35:58.550
You know, the two isolationships
that I mentioned,

35:58.583 --> 36:00.585
I have to have
a very unsavory conversation

36:00.619 --> 36:02.021
with number two.

36:02.054 --> 36:03.321
Leaving me already,

36:03.355 --> 36:04.623
this is terrible
for my self-esteem.

36:04.657 --> 36:06.726
Which... which one is number two?

36:06.759 --> 36:08.995
The one that's trying
to use last Thursday's article

36:09.028 --> 36:10.897
to talk me into a three-way.

36:10.930 --> 36:12.732
That is
a fascinating coincidence.

36:12.765 --> 36:13.633
Wow!

36:13.666 --> 36:15.902
Relax, Judge Judy.

36:15.935 --> 36:17.770
This is a three-way
with his step-sister.

36:17.804 --> 36:20.106
Oh God, that is fucked!

36:20.139 --> 36:22.875
I don't know,
I'm pretty into it, okay?

36:22.909 --> 36:25.111
But you have
to draw the line somewhere.

36:25.144 --> 36:26.979
And this is
where you draw your line?

36:27.013 --> 36:30.783
I have a lot of lines, Paul,
and I draw them often.

36:30.817 --> 36:32.018
In fact, you know what?

36:32.051 --> 36:33.786
I'm gonna draw one right now.

36:33.820 --> 36:34.452
See?

36:34.486 --> 36:35.487
That's it. It's right here?

36:35.520 --> 36:35.955
Right here.

36:35.988 --> 36:37.957
This is the line?

36:38.791 --> 36:42.494
Alright, well, later.

36:57.643 --> 37:00.880
♪ So I can answer to myself ♪

37:05.751 --> 37:08.154
Oh, hell,
I don't know about this, Peggy.

37:08.187 --> 37:10.388
Do you see?

37:10.422 --> 37:12.390
Yeah, I look old.

37:12.424 --> 37:13.491
Oh, God.

37:13.525 --> 37:17.029
I tell you I don't think
I look like that in person.

37:17.063 --> 37:19.999
Well, now,
what is that supposed to mean?

37:20.032 --> 37:21.100
What?

37:21.133 --> 37:23.035
No, no,
I think that the pink shirt,

37:23.069 --> 37:24.804
I think it brings out the blue
in my eyes.

37:24.837 --> 37:26.806
I really do.

37:26.839 --> 37:27.472
Well, yes, it does...

37:27.505 --> 37:29.709
No, it does not wash me out.

37:29.742 --> 37:31.476
I don't even know
what that means.

37:31.509 --> 37:33.012
No, but we will have to agree
to disagree

37:33.045 --> 37:34.714
on this one, sweetie.

37:34.747 --> 37:37.817
Yeah, 'cause I am no way
changin' this shirt.

37:37.850 --> 37:39.719
Whoa?

37:39.752 --> 37:42.554
Oh, hell.

37:46.092 --> 37:47.960
Oh, damn, that is good.

37:47.994 --> 37:50.162
Oh, look at that, Peggy.

37:50.196 --> 37:51.596
Look at your man.

37:51.631 --> 37:53.733
Oh, goofy, you were right.

37:53.766 --> 37:55.868
I apologize, that's on me.

37:55.902 --> 37:57.803
Good for me, yeah.

37:57.837 --> 37:58.603
Okay.

37:59.839 --> 38:01.606
Here we go.

38:01.641 --> 38:02.507
Mm.

38:03.776 --> 38:05.111
Okay.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.494
Hmm.

38:22.527 --> 38:23.729
Well, damn it.

38:24.697 --> 38:25.998
That is
the fourth time this week, huh?

38:27.033 --> 38:29.635
Well, yes, of course,
I'm gonna keep trying.

38:29.669 --> 38:32.204
Damn,
what has gotten to you today?

38:32.238 --> 38:36.508
What... that... be... because
I don't know what that does?

38:36.541 --> 38:37.643
Yes.

38:37.677 --> 38:40.612
No, it... uh, no, I wish I still
had my old keyboard,

38:40.646 --> 38:41.479
I could just type.

38:41.513 --> 38:43.082
That took me
so fuckin' long to learn

38:43.115 --> 38:44.150
now I gotta
hit buttons everywhere

38:44.183 --> 38:46.953
and that doesn't tell me
anything!

38:46.986 --> 38:48.154
What?

38:48.187 --> 38:50.656
What do you mean I...
I need support?

38:50.690 --> 38:54.660
I... I tell you
now you're just being mean.

38:54.694 --> 38:57.063
Yeah, I'm not gonna do it.

38:57.096 --> 39:00.498
No, I am not.

39:00.532 --> 39:02.868
Oh, fine, you win as usual.

39:02.902 --> 39:05.137
Okay.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.208
Uh, and now we got a unicorn.

39:13.079 --> 39:14.180
Thank you
for contacting Alicorn...

39:14.213 --> 39:15.815
Marcus, will you please tell
Jodi

39:15.848 --> 39:17.582
that he's bein' a real prick
right now?

39:17.615 --> 39:18.884
I said,
"Don't call me a 'prick'".

39:18.918 --> 39:19.719
Jodi!

39:19.752 --> 39:20.618
What do you want me
to call somebody

39:20.653 --> 39:22.221
who changes shirts
throughout the day?

39:22.254 --> 39:23.689
What? Are you hosting the
Oscars?

39:23.723 --> 39:24.790
I didn't change shirts.

39:24.824 --> 39:27.660
I took off my vest,
'cause I didn't wanna rip it up!

39:27.693 --> 39:28.526
You know what?

39:28.560 --> 39:30.062
You wanna take...
you wanna take stuff?

39:30.096 --> 39:31.563
I'll take stuff off.

39:31.596 --> 39:32.765
I'm... we're all taking it
off now.

39:32.798 --> 39:34.133
It's comin' off!

39:34.166 --> 39:35.634
Look at the peacock go!

39:35.668 --> 39:36.402
Yup.

39:36.435 --> 39:37.069
Look at the peacock go!

39:37.103 --> 39:38.170
Yup.

39:38.204 --> 39:39.071
Yeah.

39:39.105 --> 39:41.674
Jodi, Glen!

39:41.707 --> 39:45.177
You cannot call me at work
with this... whatever this is.

39:45.211 --> 39:49.081
Oh, do you mean solving
the space-time continuum?

39:49.115 --> 39:51.984
Oh, we... we're so sorry
we bothered you at work

39:52.018 --> 39:53.919
with this
time-sensitive material.

39:53.953 --> 39:55.921
We're just over here tryin'
to save the world

39:55.955 --> 39:56.655
Oh.

39:56.689 --> 39:58.556
And we didn't call you at work,

39:58.590 --> 40:00.292
we called
the Alicorn support line

40:00.326 --> 40:03.129
hoping you could support us
with our problem.

40:03.162 --> 40:04.797
Yeah, you called
the technical support line

40:04.830 --> 40:08.600
for people who need actual help
with the actual platform.

40:08.634 --> 40:11.804
Well,
we technically need your help

40:11.837 --> 40:14.140
and we might also need
your support financially.

40:14.173 --> 40:15.573
I haven't got no money.

40:15.607 --> 40:17.076
Because apparently,
flux capacitors

40:17.109 --> 40:19.078
are not a real thing
and this strikes me

40:19.111 --> 40:20.880
as it's going to be
quite expensive to find.

40:20.913 --> 40:22.915
Yes, they are real

40:22.948 --> 40:24.683
and I keep trying
to tell you that,

40:24.717 --> 40:26.652
but you're too busy
hangin' posters of yourself

40:26.685 --> 40:29.155
from your mantle.

40:29.188 --> 40:32.925
Glen, for the argument's sake,
let's say they are real.

40:32.958 --> 40:35.694
If they are it's not like
we can go pick 'em up

40:35.728 --> 40:38.831
at the tractor supply in the
plutonium aisle, you dumbass.

40:38.864 --> 40:40.565
Oh-oh.

40:41.934 --> 40:44.070
That's not even the section
you'd look in,

40:44.103 --> 40:46.372
you dumbass!

40:46.405 --> 40:47.840
I'm the dumbass, huh?

40:47.873 --> 40:49.008
That's I'm... I'm dumb?

40:49.041 --> 40:52.211
Okay, fine, friendship over.

40:52.244 --> 40:54.647
Listen, I'm not sure...
sure if this is the connection,

40:54.680 --> 40:56.248
but it sounded like you said
"friendship over"

40:56.282 --> 40:58.084
and if you did say
"friendship over",

40:58.117 --> 40:59.952
I'm gonna say "fine".

40:59.985 --> 41:01.053
Glorious.

41:01.987 --> 41:03.689
I wish you could see my face
right now,

41:03.722 --> 41:04.223
'cause I'm excited.

41:04.256 --> 41:05.424
Oh, aren't you?

41:05.458 --> 41:07.760
I wish you could see mine,
'cause I'm smiling ear to ear.

41:07.793 --> 41:10.029
I can see you right now
and I'm...

41:10.062 --> 41:12.064
You're the worst.

41:13.833 --> 41:14.733
That's not nice.

41:14.767 --> 41:15.935
That is unkind.

41:15.968 --> 41:18.104
That is unkind!

41:20.873 --> 41:24.143
Um, hey, have you guys,
I don't know,

41:24.176 --> 41:25.311
checked Amazon Prime?

41:26.846 --> 41:29.882
Do they... wait, d...
do they ship stuff like that?

41:29.915 --> 41:32.384
Oh, it could be there
in less than two hours.

41:33.652 --> 41:37.123
You... what do you uh, I mean
in your professional opinion,

41:37.156 --> 41:38.791
what do you think somethin'
like that might run us?

41:38.824 --> 41:41.694
Oh, in my professional opinion,
you guys are idiots.

41:41.727 --> 41:44.296
See, now, I can't tell if you're
professionally insulting us

41:44.330 --> 41:46.365
or just reminiscing
about community college.

41:46.398 --> 41:47.366
Um, I think I was pretty clear.

41:47.399 --> 41:49.735
Yeah, Jodi and the Idiots
could have been huge

41:49.768 --> 41:51.737
if we could have
just found a drummer.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.939
But as a power pop
acoustic trio,

41:53.973 --> 41:54.974
we were quite good.

41:55.007 --> 41:57.743
I literally can't believe
I agreed to be in a band

41:57.776 --> 41:59.278
called "Jodi and the Idiots".

41:59.311 --> 42:01.447
Well, it was edgy you know,
like the music.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.948
Alright, tell you what?

42:02.982 --> 42:05.751
If you guys promise
to kiss, makeup,

42:05.784 --> 42:07.119
and don't call me again
at work,

42:07.153 --> 42:08.988
I will look up
your flux capacitor.

42:09.021 --> 42:11.056
Deal?

42:11.090 --> 42:13.792
I would be willing
to overlook his infidelities,

42:13.826 --> 42:14.793
Yes.

42:14.827 --> 42:17.263
That... whatever.

42:17.296 --> 42:19.265
Glen?

42:19.298 --> 42:22.968
I uh... alright, yeah, yeah.

42:23.002 --> 42:23.969
Okay, deal.

42:24.003 --> 42:25.104
Deal.

42:25.137 --> 42:26.138
Okay, done.

42:26.172 --> 42:27.139
I'm hangin' up now.

42:27.173 --> 42:28.407
Love you, Marcus!

42:28.440 --> 42:29.842
Jodi and the Idiots forever!

42:31.143 --> 42:32.144
God.

42:37.917 --> 42:39.785
You treat everyone this way?

42:41.353 --> 42:44.857
Phew!

42:47.159 --> 42:48.827
Thank you for contacting
the Alicorn support team.

42:48.861 --> 42:49.795
My name is Marcus.

42:49.828 --> 42:50.462
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking to?

42:50.496 --> 42:51.397
Marcus?

42:51.430 --> 42:52.264
Oh, your name is Marcus, too?

42:52.298 --> 42:52.965
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

42:52.998 --> 42:55.134
No, no, no, my name is Kelly!

42:55.167 --> 42:57.303
Oh, uh, Kelly, sorry about that.

42:57.336 --> 42:58.971
Nice to meet you.
How can I assist you today?

42:59.004 --> 42:59.905
Hold on here.

42:59.939 --> 43:02.274
No, no, no, uh...
are you in a public space?

43:02.308 --> 43:03.943
There is a pandemic.

43:03.976 --> 43:05.444
No, no, no,
you can't be in public.

43:05.477 --> 43:06.745
Get... get safe.

43:06.779 --> 43:08.080
Go s... go be safe.

43:08.113 --> 43:09.448
I'll call back later.

43:09.481 --> 43:12.117
No, I... I promise
we're in a very safe location.

43:12.151 --> 43:13.752
We're in a very
scaled-down version

43:13.786 --> 43:14.853
of our office,

43:14.887 --> 43:15.921
but if it makes you
more comfortable,

43:15.955 --> 43:17.289
I can
put up a virtual background.

43:17.323 --> 43:18.457
How about uh...

43:18.490 --> 43:19.758
At the beach?

43:19.792 --> 43:21.493
Oh, I do not like that at all.

43:21.527 --> 43:24.029
Okay, um, we can try...
how about space?

43:25.364 --> 43:26.365
Oh!

43:27.266 --> 43:28.133
Oh, fuck!

43:28.167 --> 43:29.401
Peggy, take a look at this.

43:29.435 --> 43:31.103
He's in outer space.

43:31.136 --> 43:32.104
Can I do that?

43:32.137 --> 43:33.205
Yeah, you can.

43:33.239 --> 43:35.140
Just click on your settings.

43:35.174 --> 43:36.041
My settings.

43:36.075 --> 43:38.777
Wait, h... hold on,
Marcus the Unicorn.

43:38.811 --> 43:40.179
Okay.

43:40.212 --> 43:41.914
Oh, hell no!

43:41.947 --> 43:42.881
No, oh, no!

43:42.915 --> 43:44.984
This... no, I don't want this.

43:45.017 --> 43:46.919
No, that...
I don't know what that is.

43:46.952 --> 43:47.553
No.

43:47.586 --> 43:48.354
No, what... no.

43:48.387 --> 43:51.023
Okay, no.

43:51.056 --> 43:53.092
I know it's worse, Peggy,
I'm lookin' right at it.

43:53.125 --> 43:54.159
It's a nightmare.

43:54.193 --> 43:55.327
Um...

43:55.361 --> 43:56.462
Oh!

43:56.495 --> 43:58.530
What's happening here?

43:58.564 --> 44:00.499
Just click... click out
of your settings, Kelly.

44:00.532 --> 44:04.036
My settings...
oh, hell, motherfucker!

44:04.069 --> 44:06.405
Oh!

44:06.438 --> 44:08.574
Holy shit balls!

44:08.607 --> 44:09.875
So...

44:09.908 --> 44:11.143
How can I assist you today?

44:11.176 --> 44:12.511
So here's what's happening?

44:12.544 --> 44:14.480
Our son Dylan...

44:14.513 --> 44:15.581
He's on your program.

44:15.614 --> 44:18.884
So now he sent me this thing
to put on my computer,

44:18.917 --> 44:22.321
so that we could talk
to each other face-to-face.

44:22.354 --> 44:23.455
I cannot get him.

44:23.489 --> 44:25.557
It keeps sayin'
that he is unavailable

44:25.591 --> 44:28.227
and I have tried for four times
this week.

44:29.194 --> 44:33.065
Well, um, I think
when it says unavailable,

44:33.098 --> 44:35.301
it just means that
there's not actually an issue

44:35.334 --> 44:37.169
with the actual software,

44:37.202 --> 44:40.839
but um, he...
he just may not be answering.

44:42.642 --> 44:45.344
Well, you know, uh,
I'm not gonna fight you,

44:45.377 --> 44:46.478
'cause I don't know for sure

44:46.512 --> 44:49.114
I d... I... I don't know.

44:49.148 --> 44:52.251
That... that could be true.

44:52.284 --> 44:54.520
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to Dylan?

44:54.553 --> 44:55.354
Oh, wow.

44:55.387 --> 44:57.289
Uh, what do you say?
About a month?

44:57.323 --> 44:59.058
Yeah, we think it's been
about a month, yeah.

44:59.091 --> 45:00.259
Now, I will tell you this.

45:00.292 --> 45:01.260
We assumed

45:01.293 --> 45:03.195
that we would be talking to him
a lot more,

45:03.228 --> 45:06.065
because everybody...
everybody's on lockdown.

45:06.098 --> 45:10.202
Uh, but I talk more with Brenda
over at the drugstore,

45:10.235 --> 45:13.138
because she gives me
my diabetes medicine,

45:13.172 --> 45:15.140
and she...

45:16.475 --> 45:19.278
Okay, hold on there,
Marcus uni... unicorn.

45:19.311 --> 45:22.414
No, no, no, no, she does not
have eyes for me, Peggy.

45:22.448 --> 45:23.282
You know what?

45:23.315 --> 45:25.951
You need to cool your jets,
woman.

45:25.984 --> 45:27.019
Sir, you keep saying "we".

45:27.052 --> 45:28.954
Is there... is there
someone else there with you?

45:28.987 --> 45:31.957
Oh-oh,
would you excuse my manners?

45:31.990 --> 45:34.159
Now, this is on me,
my apologies.

45:34.193 --> 45:39.431
Yes, Marcus the Unicorn,
let me introduce you to Peggy.

45:39.465 --> 45:41.900
This is my beautiful wife Peggy.

45:41.934 --> 45:43.001
Take a look at that.

45:43.035 --> 45:44.169
Now, that's a face.

45:44.203 --> 45:46.138
That's a face.

45:46.171 --> 45:48.173
Oh, God bless her.

45:48.207 --> 45:50.242
Marcus, that's Peggy.

45:50.275 --> 45:51.543
Okay.

45:51.577 --> 45:54.113
Yeah, she is... she's
one of those special people

45:54.146 --> 45:58.283
in the world
and uh, she's a gift.

45:58.317 --> 46:00.919
She is definitely a gift to me.

46:00.953 --> 46:03.055
But I would tell you,

46:03.088 --> 46:05.190
between you and me,
Marcus the Unicorn,

46:05.224 --> 46:07.926
she's in a bit of a mood,
because she's kinda pissed off

46:07.960 --> 46:09.228
that we can't
get a hold of Dylan

46:09.261 --> 46:11.130
on this video chat.

46:11.163 --> 46:14.099
So I think you're best
just to talk with me.

46:14.133 --> 46:15.601
You know what I'm saying?

46:15.635 --> 46:17.202
Yeah, I hear you.

46:17.236 --> 46:19.304
Um, well, I'll tell you what?

46:19.338 --> 46:21.407
I am gonna figure out
what is going on on my end

46:21.440 --> 46:23.342
and in the meantime,
why don't you tell me more

46:23.375 --> 46:27.312
about Peggy and Brenda
down at the drugstore.

46:27.346 --> 46:28.313
Oh.

46:29.649 --> 46:31.617
Oh, Marcus, now you... oh.

46:32.551 --> 46:33.686
I see what you're doin'.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.555
You're tryin' to get me
to walk a very dangerous line.

46:36.588 --> 46:37.556
I see what you're doin'.

46:37.589 --> 46:39.124
Yes.

46:39.158 --> 46:40.192
And let me tell you somethin'.

46:40.225 --> 46:41.694
I'm gonna walk it, that's right.

46:41.728 --> 46:45.197
Now,
it is a very dramatic situation,

46:45.230 --> 46:46.999
because Peggy...

46:53.673 --> 46:57.409
You know, Marcus, life is funny,

46:57.443 --> 47:01.413
and things aren't always
as you think they're gonna be,

47:01.447 --> 47:05.083
and sometimes... 'cause like...
like my Peggy everyone...

47:05.117 --> 47:08.353
everyone loved her...
uh, loves her and...

47:13.091 --> 47:14.727
I'm sorry, Marcus the Unicorn,
somethin'...

47:14.761 --> 47:17.229
Uh, hold on a second.

47:17.262 --> 47:19.699
Okay, Marcus, have...
uh, have you been talkin'

47:19.732 --> 47:22.000
to your family during all this,
'cause it's good...

47:22.034 --> 47:24.069
It's good to be tied
with family,

47:24.102 --> 47:27.306
'cause all of a sudden,
sometimes they're not there.

47:27.339 --> 47:30.743
No, I... you're right, Kelly.

47:32.578 --> 47:34.012
I... I could do better.

47:34.046 --> 47:36.014
Family's everything.

47:36.048 --> 47:38.116
Family's everything and that...
that's why I got...

47:38.150 --> 47:39.251
I gotta talk to Dylan.

47:39.284 --> 47:41.553
I... I, sometimes I...
I think he um...

47:44.757 --> 47:47.192
I think he forgets sometimes.

47:47.226 --> 47:48.761
Don't... don't you forget, okay?

47:49.762 --> 47:53.031
Oh, hell, speakin' of drama,
look at this!

47:53.065 --> 47:54.032
Oh, my goodness!

47:54.066 --> 47:55.635
Oh, take a look at this.

47:55.668 --> 47:58.337
Oh, Marc... Marcus, yeah,
you see this thing here?

47:58.370 --> 48:00.740
Yeah,
this is my doorbell camera.

48:00.773 --> 48:01.641
Ain't that somethin'?

48:01.674 --> 48:03.643
Yeah, I can see
all the delivery people,

48:03.676 --> 48:05.745
'cause I have my food
delivered, isn't that somethin'?

48:05.778 --> 48:09.047
Other than the weekend marathon
of Forensic Files,

48:09.081 --> 48:10.382
this is my entertainment.

48:10.415 --> 48:11.550
I watch them bring me my food...

48:12.618 --> 48:15.755
And I make sure
that they follow the protocol.

48:15.788 --> 48:17.589
Oh, what's...
what's the protocol?

48:17.623 --> 48:19.224
Oh, well, the protocol is

48:19.258 --> 48:21.426
to keep your fingers
off my shit!

48:22.695 --> 48:24.831
I mean I'm not lookin' to die
in this house here, Marcus.

48:24.864 --> 48:27.266
No, no, no.

48:27.299 --> 48:28.835
How much did you make
on that one?

48:28.868 --> 48:30.670
Eight bucks.

48:30.703 --> 48:32.371
Hardly seems worth the trip.

48:32.404 --> 48:34.306
We gotta pay the rent somehow,
Chloe.

48:34.339 --> 48:35.708
Just let me call my father.

48:35.742 --> 48:38.510
No, I do not wanna lean
on your parents.

48:38.544 --> 48:40.612
Tom, this is ridiculous.

48:40.647 --> 48:42.782
You just made $8.

48:42.815 --> 48:45.384
That still leaves us 600 short.

48:45.417 --> 48:47.486
Not to mention last month's,
which we still owe.

48:47.519 --> 48:48.387
I know that!

48:48.420 --> 48:49.154
You don't think I know that?

48:49.187 --> 48:50.188
See?

48:50.222 --> 48:52.224
This is what I'm talking about.

48:52.257 --> 48:54.593
Why are we doing this if we know
New York is an option?

48:54.627 --> 48:55.795
Oh, here we go.

48:55.828 --> 48:57.396
Everything is back to New York.

48:57.429 --> 48:58.363
Yes!

48:58.397 --> 48:59.464
We have family there.

48:59.498 --> 49:01.701
You have family there.

49:01.734 --> 49:02.802
What's that supposed to mean?

49:02.835 --> 49:04.771
Oh, come on, Chloe.

49:04.804 --> 49:07.172
Your family never accepted me
and why would they?

49:07.205 --> 49:09.207
I don't come from money,
I didn't go to Dartmouth,

49:09.241 --> 49:09.876
God forbid.

49:09.909 --> 49:11.109
That is not fair!

49:11.143 --> 49:13.111
My father loves you.

49:13.145 --> 49:16.281
And I told you a million times,
all it takes is one phone call,

49:16.315 --> 49:17.549
even if it's just temporary.

49:17.583 --> 49:20.319
I don't wanna mooch off
my wife's parents.

49:20.352 --> 49:24.289
You are not mooching,
you'd be working for it.

49:24.323 --> 49:26.224
Can't you... you know,
you're not the only one

49:26.258 --> 49:28.460
who's lost their job,
because of all this?

49:28.493 --> 49:29.494
I hate to break it to you,
honey,

49:29.528 --> 49:30.697
but you're not that special.

49:31.931 --> 49:35.267
I'm over this conversation.

49:35.300 --> 49:37.169
What is really going on here?

49:37.202 --> 49:38.136
Does this have something to do

49:38.170 --> 49:40.172
with all those phone calls
you keep getting?

49:40.205 --> 49:43.141
'Cause you act weird
after each one of them.

49:45.745 --> 49:46.713
Are you having an affair?

49:46.746 --> 49:47.847
Of course, I'm not.

49:47.880 --> 49:49.181
Do you not love me anymore?

49:49.214 --> 49:49.916
Of course, I love you.

49:49.949 --> 49:52.117
Then what the fuck?

49:54.319 --> 49:56.689
I'm sterile, Chloe.

49:59.257 --> 50:00.592
What?

50:00.627 --> 50:02.561
I'm sorry.

50:07.265 --> 50:09.836
Why didn't you just
tell me that?

50:09.869 --> 50:11.536
I felt so guilty.

50:14.306 --> 50:19.578
I uh, I just need
a couple of minutes

50:19.611 --> 50:21.246
to sit with this.

50:21.279 --> 50:22.314
Yeah.

50:22.347 --> 50:24.316
Yeah, of course.

50:26.284 --> 50:30.322
Uh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna do a few more runs

50:30.355 --> 50:32.925
and um,
I'll call you in a while.

50:34.593 --> 50:36.763
Yeah, okay.

50:38.597 --> 50:39.832
Bye.

51:09.996 --> 51:11.596
Hey.

51:11.631 --> 51:12.765
Hey.

51:12.799 --> 51:15.233
Um, you got a minute?

51:15.267 --> 51:16.501
I... I... I gotta talk to someone.

51:16.535 --> 51:19.706
I'm uh, I'm suffering, man.

51:19.739 --> 51:20.640
Yeah.

51:20.673 --> 51:21.774
Yeah, absolutely.

51:21.808 --> 51:24.576
Is it...
is it about your bandana?

51:28.047 --> 51:29.649
I'm contemplating
leaving my wife

51:29.682 --> 51:31.583
for another woman.

51:31.616 --> 51:33.653
Oh, fuck.

51:33.686 --> 51:35.922
Um, okay.

51:35.955 --> 51:38.423
Yeah, yeah, and I can't...
I can't seem to tell her

51:38.457 --> 51:40.760
and every time I want to,
it just...

51:40.793 --> 51:42.594
It doesn't come out.

51:42.628 --> 51:44.596
Yeah, I would imagine
it's pretty hard

51:44.630 --> 51:47.900
to bring up something like that.

51:47.934 --> 51:51.938
Um, I mean I don't wanna pry,
but what the fuck?

51:51.971 --> 51:53.472
I mean Chloe's great.

51:53.505 --> 51:56.843
I'm not saying I don't love her,
okay?

51:56.876 --> 52:00.612
I just... I don't feel it
the same way

52:00.646 --> 52:02.715
that I do with this other woman.

52:03.515 --> 52:04.449
I-

52:05.484 --> 52:06.886
I told her I'm sterile.

52:06.919 --> 52:07.787
You're sterile?

52:07.820 --> 52:09.521
No!

52:09.554 --> 52:11.657
I was tryin' to tell the truth,
but I panicked

52:11.691 --> 52:14.426
and that other thing came out.

52:14.459 --> 52:19.297
Yeah, the other thing
being the big fucking lie.

52:19.999 --> 52:22.001
That's all fucked, man.

52:23.703 --> 52:25.738
You're divorced.

52:25.772 --> 52:27.572
Was it like this?

52:27.606 --> 52:28.507
Did you ever...

52:28.540 --> 52:31.409
Have an affair?

52:31.443 --> 52:33.545
No, Anna and I's relationship
wasn't like that.

52:33.578 --> 52:34.613
What was it like?

52:34.647 --> 52:36.916
I need
a little bit of advice here.

52:36.949 --> 52:39.852
I love you, Tom,
like a brother okay?

52:39.886 --> 52:41.386
And nothing will
ever change that.

52:41.419 --> 52:44.023
I've known you since I was
fuckin' 12 years old

52:44.056 --> 52:46.959
and the one thing
that I know about you

52:46.993 --> 52:49.528
is that you're a fucking coward

52:49.561 --> 52:51.764
when it comes
to doin' the hard thing.

52:51.798 --> 52:53.032
Harsh.

52:53.065 --> 52:55.433
Uh, but okay.

52:55.467 --> 52:56.869
You mean telling her the truth?

52:56.903 --> 53:00.539
No, I mean working on it
with your wife.

53:00.572 --> 53:02.742
She left New York, dude.

53:02.775 --> 53:05.945
She left behind her friends,
and her family,

53:05.978 --> 53:08.114
and her stability,
and for what?

53:08.147 --> 53:08.848
For you.

53:08.881 --> 53:09.949
She did all that

53:09.982 --> 53:11.851
because she wanted
to be with you

53:11.884 --> 53:13.853
and all because you
wouldn't move to New York.

53:13.886 --> 53:17.723
Yeah, because I had a job,
and friends, and I had a home!

53:17.757 --> 53:21.060
Yes, all things that
you could acquire in New York

53:21.093 --> 53:22.394
and you know that.

53:22.427 --> 53:24.396
Fuck you, you think I'm scared.

53:24.429 --> 53:25.731
I know you're fuckin' scared

53:25.765 --> 53:27.599
and this other woman
is just another opportunity

53:27.633 --> 53:29.936
for you to fuckin' run away
from your problem.

53:29.969 --> 53:31.369
Is it? Is it?

53:31.403 --> 53:33.673
I mean here comes
good old righteous man

53:33.706 --> 53:35.775
riding in on his high horse
to do the right thing,

53:35.808 --> 53:37.009
but when it comes to love,

53:37.043 --> 53:39.011
you are just as fucked up
as all of us.

53:39.045 --> 53:42.547
You settled for Anna,
because it was convenient,

53:42.581 --> 53:45.785
and she deserved better,
she knew it, and so she left.

53:45.818 --> 53:47.787
And you don't think Chloe
deserves better than this,

53:47.820 --> 53:48.821
you fuckin' prick?

53:48.855 --> 53:50.422
Okay, you know, I called you,

53:50.455 --> 53:52.158
because I needed
to talk to a friend.

53:52.191 --> 53:54.426
If I'd wanted to talk
to a judgmental asshole,

53:54.459 --> 53:55.661
I would have
called my father-in-law.

53:55.695 --> 53:56.829
Oh, fuck off!

54:00.833 --> 54:02.534
Fuck!

54:05.037 --> 54:06.639
Fuck.

54:11.811 --> 54:13.578
No, no, no, no.

54:16.682 --> 54:18.718
Goddammit.

54:23.656 --> 54:27.994
Don't fuckin' call me.

54:31.998 --> 54:33.833
What the fuck does he...

54:58.124 --> 55:00.525
Hey.

55:00.558 --> 55:01.994
Hey.

55:05.932 --> 55:11.603
Um, you... you called me.

55:12.271 --> 55:13.406
You called me.

55:13.438 --> 55:16.709
Yeah, sorry, I didn't know
if you'd actually answer it

55:16.742 --> 55:17.542
or not.

55:17.575 --> 55:18.844
Hi, how are you?

55:18.878 --> 55:22.682
How is all of this um...

55:22.715 --> 55:26.584
Um, I uh...

55:26.618 --> 55:28.854
Um, I'm good, I'm good.

55:28.888 --> 55:29.655
How's work?

55:29.689 --> 55:31.523
How's...

55:31.556 --> 55:33.626
Things are good,
things are good for me.

55:33.659 --> 55:38.596
I uh, haven't had my golden god
Almost Famous moment yet,

55:38.631 --> 55:41.499
but you know,
fingers are crossed.

55:41.533 --> 55:44.536
Maybe we're...
maybe we're close to it.

55:44.569 --> 55:48.207
Uh, and you... you're... you're...
you're good.

55:49.607 --> 55:51.043
What's up?

55:51.077 --> 55:52.144
Yeah, n... I mean nothin'.

55:52.178 --> 55:57.549
I just uh, I had this
weird conversation with Tom.

55:57.582 --> 56:00.618
They're always weird,
but this one was...

56:00.653 --> 56:02.989
This one kinda
brought some stuff up

56:03.022 --> 56:06.158
that got me thinking
and I wanted to reach out and...

56:07.994 --> 56:08.995
Okay.

56:09.028 --> 56:11.063
it's nothing like weird
or anything like that.

56:11.097 --> 56:15.167
I just uh, you know, with us...
as it got me thinking about us

56:15.201 --> 56:18.070
and I like that...
you know, I like to think

56:18.104 --> 56:20.639
that we both know what happened,
right?

56:20.673 --> 56:22.108
Like it was
very black and white,

56:22.141 --> 56:24.744
and uh, you know, we worked,

56:24.777 --> 56:28.080
and then
we just weren't anymore.

56:28.114 --> 56:29.248
And it was very clear.

56:29.281 --> 56:31.784
That was very clear
to both of us.

56:31.817 --> 56:34.320
We're such different people
and not in

56:34.353 --> 56:36.956
like a "we're so different,
it's cute" kinda way,

56:36.989 --> 56:38.290
but more in like

56:38.324 --> 56:40.592
"incompatibly different shit
is fucked" kinda way.

56:40.626 --> 56:44.230
Well, we were compatible
in some ways.

56:49.035 --> 56:52.271
You know, what are you... I...
the sex was good?

56:52.304 --> 56:53.072
Good?

56:53.105 --> 56:54.006
Just good?

56:54.707 --> 56:55.841
What do you want me to say?

56:55.875 --> 56:57.743
Oh, it fit like a glove.

56:57.777 --> 56:59.879
Oh my God, it was so great.

56:59.912 --> 57:01.714
That... that sounds good.

57:01.747 --> 57:03.581
I'm just gonna check
with my ego real quick.

57:03.615 --> 57:04.650
Do we approve of that?

57:04.683 --> 57:05.985
Is that a good answer for us?

57:07.853 --> 57:09.088
I remember we had to Google

57:09.121 --> 57:10.956
what happens
if it's too big to fit.

57:10.990 --> 57:12.258
No.

57:12.291 --> 57:15.261
We were curious if other people
had that problem.

57:15.294 --> 57:16.896
We did not have that problem.

57:16.929 --> 57:18.998
I think we did.

57:19.031 --> 57:21.233
I think... I think we did.

57:21.267 --> 57:24.170
I think I remember
why we got divorced.

57:24.203 --> 57:25.204
Because it was too big?

57:30.242 --> 57:31.811
So you're still
wearing your wedding ring.

57:31.844 --> 57:34.680
That's cool.

57:34.713 --> 57:36.182
I...

57:37.950 --> 57:40.219
It's honest... it's so...
that's so fuckin' embarrassing.

57:40.252 --> 57:41.720
I would...

57:43.756 --> 57:46.325
I can't take it off just yet.

57:54.233 --> 57:56.368
I liked you're...
you're different.

58:05.411 --> 58:07.246
Um...

58:14.753 --> 58:17.056
Yeah, I uh,
I liked you're different, too.

58:18.457 --> 58:21.427
Um,

58:21.460 --> 58:25.064
sometimes you know different
is just uh,

58:27.733 --> 58:28.968
too different.

58:29.001 --> 58:30.836
Yeah.

58:38.077 --> 58:40.746
I can't stop thinkin' back
to 10 years ago

58:40.779 --> 58:44.817
and what...
what would my life be like

58:44.850 --> 58:47.219
if I didn't approach you
in that coffee shop.

58:47.253 --> 58:49.054
Who would I be?

58:49.088 --> 58:51.123
Are you serious right now?

58:51.157 --> 58:52.691
You know, I approached you.

58:52.725 --> 58:53.459
You're insane.

58:53.492 --> 58:54.860
No!

58:54.894 --> 58:56.829
Do you not remember
my choice pickup line?

58:56.862 --> 58:59.698
Okay, um,

58:59.732 --> 59:02.768
"Hey, uh,
sorry to bother you.

59:02.801 --> 59:04.470
I...- I was sitting
at this table earlier

59:04.503 --> 59:06.972
and I...
I think I left my jacket here.

59:07.006 --> 59:09.942
Do you mind if I just uh,
so do you, um..."

59:09.975 --> 59:12.378
Oh my God.

59:12.411 --> 59:14.079
It was you.

59:14.113 --> 59:16.348
Oh, fuck!

59:16.382 --> 59:18.884
I've been lying to myself
for 10 years now.

59:18.918 --> 59:20.219
How did you come up with that?

59:20.252 --> 59:21.820
I thought...

59:21.854 --> 59:24.924
I thought it was me!

59:24.957 --> 59:27.426
And we never found that jacket,
didn't we?

59:27.459 --> 59:31.497
Well, ugh, maybe there
like wasn't a jacket.

59:31.530 --> 59:32.498
What?

59:32.531 --> 59:33.465
What?

59:33.499 --> 59:35.734
That's some Sleeper Cell shit
right there.

59:35.768 --> 59:36.335
Yeah!

59:36.368 --> 59:38.837
Is your name even Anna?

59:38.871 --> 59:41.273
That is a mind fuck.

59:41.307 --> 59:42.508
Yeah, it's okay, though.

59:42.541 --> 59:44.476
We decided not to kill you.

59:44.510 --> 59:46.312
And then we went to that movie.

59:46.345 --> 59:47.446
Did that happen?

59:47.479 --> 59:48.414
Did we go to the matinee?

59:48.447 --> 59:50.783
That was... that real,
we went to a movie.

59:50.816 --> 59:52.084
Those are real memories.

59:52.117 --> 59:53.752
Yeah.

59:53.786 --> 59:55.154
Okay. What did we see?

59:55.187 --> 59:56.488
It's classified.

59:56.522 --> 59:58.290
I could tell you,
but I'd have to kill you.

01:00:02.094 --> 01:00:03.462
Top Gun.

01:00:03.495 --> 01:00:05.397
How does it take you so long?

01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:07.766
I'm not as obsessed
with the movie as you are.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.770
Those are hot air fighter dudes.

01:00:11.804 --> 01:00:13.172
No one would argue that.

01:00:13.205 --> 01:00:14.773
Okay, thank you.

01:00:14.807 --> 01:00:15.841
I really thought it was me.

01:00:15.874 --> 01:00:19.211
I really thought I approached...
approached you.

01:00:19.245 --> 01:00:22.047
That is a mind fuck!

01:00:22.081 --> 01:00:25.117
I do you miss your bullshit.

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:27.453
And I miss your mood swings.

01:00:35.094 --> 01:00:36.795
It's good to see you.

01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:41.834
Yeah, I just felt like closure,
right?

01:00:41.867 --> 01:00:43.202
Almost.

01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:50.309
You can be my wingman anytime.

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:53.345
Bullshit, you can be mine.

01:00:56.482 --> 01:00:59.184
Well, that...
that feels like closure.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.423
Yeah.

01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:08.060
I'll see you around.

01:01:08.093 --> 01:01:10.496
Yeah, you better.

01:01:10.529 --> 01:01:11.597
Okay.

01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:14.166
Bye.

01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:15.100
Bye.

01:01:33.085 --> 01:01:34.420
Okay.

01:01:54.573 --> 01:01:56.175
Hey, girl!

01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:57.009
Hey, Lex.

01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:58.544
What's up?

01:01:58.577 --> 01:01:59.545
You're in a good mood.

01:02:00.479 --> 01:02:02.915
It is nap time,
my favorite time of day.

01:02:02.948 --> 01:02:04.283
So that might explain it.

01:02:04.316 --> 01:02:06.518
Oh nice, what's up?

01:02:06.552 --> 01:02:07.453
What's good?

01:02:07.486 --> 01:02:10.422
You kinda look like
you've been crying.

01:02:10.456 --> 01:02:12.157
I'm good, I'm good,

01:02:12.191 --> 01:02:15.260
I uh, I just you know,
I was just having a moment.

01:02:15.294 --> 01:02:19.198
Oh, yes, I've had quite a few of
those lately, actually.

01:02:19.231 --> 01:02:20.667
I know what you mean.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.936
Is this um,
is this bipolar-related or...

01:02:23.969 --> 01:02:26.639
Oh, uh, no, ex-husband-related.

01:02:26.673 --> 01:02:29.308
Oh shit!

01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:30.309
What happened?

01:02:30.342 --> 01:02:31.543
Nothing.

01:02:31.577 --> 01:02:34.146
We just had the talk you know,
like our Annie Hall ending,

01:02:34.179 --> 01:02:35.214
I suppose.

01:02:35.247 --> 01:02:38.917
Oh, yes, the wistful coda.

01:02:38.951 --> 01:02:40.486
You know, you still love him,
right?

01:02:40.519 --> 01:02:43.122
I know, I do, but you know,

01:02:43.155 --> 01:02:44.623
just because two people
love each other

01:02:44.657 --> 01:02:46.626
does not mean
they should be together.

01:02:46.659 --> 01:02:49.395
You are a wiser man than I,
for sure.

01:02:50.697 --> 01:02:52.097
How's the poetry?

01:02:52.131 --> 01:02:53.465
Uh...

01:02:53.499 --> 01:02:54.400
How's music?

01:02:54.433 --> 01:02:56.235
Meh.

01:02:56.268 --> 01:02:58.604
I play a lot, it's palliative

01:02:58.638 --> 01:03:03.710
and um, keeps the hypomanic
and depressive episodes at bay,

01:03:03.743 --> 01:03:06.278
but the writing not so much.

01:03:06.311 --> 01:03:07.446
I... I feel you.

01:03:07.479 --> 01:03:12.584
I'm... I am uh, speechless,
as they say.

01:03:12.618 --> 01:03:14.253
I've got absolutely nothing
to say.

01:03:14.286 --> 01:03:16.388
I'm just trying
to get from point A to point B

01:03:16.422 --> 01:03:18.257
right now, so...

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:19.258
How's Nonny?

01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:21.160
How's New York?

01:03:21.193 --> 01:03:25.464
Uh, I mean New York is
not very New Yorkish right now,

01:03:25.497 --> 01:03:27.433
as you can imagine.

01:03:27.466 --> 01:03:30.102
We're doing everything we can
to stay connected

01:03:30.135 --> 01:03:32.037
and spend time together.

01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:35.073
I guess we're trying to so...

01:03:35.107 --> 01:03:37.677
And hey, don't... don't you worry
about that music either.

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.680
That's gonna come, you just
gotta give it time, you know?

01:03:40.713 --> 01:03:44.183
Maybe... maybe like go on hinge,
find yourself a new muse.

01:03:45.685 --> 01:03:47.486
Um, um, a muse that isn't Ben?

01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:49.221
I don't know maybe.

01:03:49.254 --> 01:03:51.056
Maybe it is still Ben.

01:03:51.089 --> 01:03:52.991
Maybe you stop looking for
closure

01:03:53.025 --> 01:03:55.961
and you just become grateful
for the goodbye.

01:03:57.362 --> 01:03:58.363
Oh, God!

01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:02.067
That's my kid screaming,
I'm pretty sure.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.436
Well, give her a big hug for me,

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:07.774
and tell the kids I say "hello",
tell Nonny I give her kisses.

01:04:07.807 --> 01:04:09.274
I will.

01:04:09.308 --> 01:04:10.677
You wanna chat again next week?

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:12.244
Yes, definitely.

01:04:12.277 --> 01:04:14.279
Okay, same time, same place.

Remember when the world
looked like this?

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:45.370
When finding love
was less complicated,

01:05:45.404 --> 01:05:48.440
and finding the time
to manage your love life,

01:05:48.473 --> 01:05:51.644
or lack thereof,
was your biggest fear,

01:05:51.678 --> 01:05:54.847
and sex didn't look like this?

01:06:13.833 --> 01:06:17.670
Hello, friends, I've missed you.

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:21.106
And to my fellow isolators...

01:06:22.942 --> 01:06:25.712

01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:29.849

with the entirety of my heart,

in the rarely-traveled crevices,

questioning my sincerity

01:07:00.245 --> 01:07:02.715
in that regard.

01:07:02.749 --> 01:07:05.785

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.514
I'm going to come unglued.

01:10:57.984 --> 01:10:59.151
Denzel.

01:10:59.185 --> 01:11:01.553
That's... that's a great piece.

01:11:01.586 --> 01:11:03.488
Yes, it is

01:11:03.521 --> 01:11:07.660
when it is done with passion,
and introspection,

01:11:07.693 --> 01:11:09.795
and vulnerability,

01:11:09.829 --> 01:11:13.065
but 9 times out of 10,
it is misinterpreted as anger

01:11:13.099 --> 01:11:16.202
and I spend all day
bein' shouted at.

01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:17.435
Shouted at?

01:11:17.469 --> 01:11:20.640
I mean don't they know that
we're casting a romantic film?

01:11:20.673 --> 01:11:23.142
Uh, the...

01:11:23.175 --> 01:11:26.646
The auditions this week were
all just for the male role,

01:11:26.679 --> 01:11:27.612
right?

01:11:27.647 --> 01:11:28.613
Right.

01:11:28.648 --> 01:11:30.216
Auditions for Mia
don't start till next week.

01:11:30.249 --> 01:11:31.050
Okay.

01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:35.087
Well, with that um,
do me a favor.

01:11:35.121 --> 01:11:38.590
When you're casting for Mia,

01:11:38.623 --> 01:11:42.460
if you could please

01:11:42.494 --> 01:11:46.732
use a wider net ethnically.

01:11:46.766 --> 01:11:48.600
A wider ethnical net?

01:11:48.634 --> 01:11:52.570
Yes, just... yeah, wider, yeah.

01:11:52.604 --> 01:11:54.073
Like less...

01:11:54.106 --> 01:11:55.675
White?

01:11:58.678 --> 01:12:01.080
Could you do that for me,
please?

01:12:01.113 --> 01:12:03.849
Yeah, it's just...
it's just a big step.

01:12:06.085 --> 01:12:08.120
But I'm not racist.

01:12:08.154 --> 01:12:09.722
I mean for the studio,

01:12:09.755 --> 01:12:11.991
Oh, yeah, uh...

01:12:12.024 --> 01:12:14.894
The studio does not know
about this, so...

01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:18.798
Between us, please.

01:12:20.933 --> 01:12:23.235
Ah, here's my last audition
for the day.

01:12:23.269 --> 01:12:25.104
Well, have at it.

01:12:25.137 --> 01:12:28.506
Um, thank you, Ella,
I know it's tough.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:31.777
I know it's tough, but uh,
keep up the great work.

01:12:31.811 --> 01:12:36.882
I really appreciate it
and uh, talk to you soon.

01:12:36.916 --> 01:12:38.651
Bye, Andy.

01:12:46.926 --> 01:12:47.760
Hello.

01:12:47.793 --> 01:12:49.195
Hey, hi.

01:12:49.228 --> 01:12:50.997
Hi, Paul, I'm Ella.

01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:52.898
I'm handling casting
at this point in production.

01:12:52.932 --> 01:12:53.899
Okay, hi, Ella.

01:12:53.933 --> 01:12:54.767
It's very nice to meet you

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.568
at least through the screen,
anyway.

01:12:56.601 --> 01:12:58.004
Yeah, you know, lockdown.

01:12:58.037 --> 01:12:58.971
Yeah, no, I get it.

01:12:59.005 --> 01:13:01.707
Great, so why don't we just
jump right in

01:13:01.741 --> 01:13:06.045
and we can start
with your monologue.

01:13:06.078 --> 01:13:07.680
Right, okay,
so here's the thing.

01:13:07.713 --> 01:13:11.817
I... I actually um, I...
I don't know much about the role

01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:13.152
or the project.

01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:14.954
You don't have
anything prepared?

01:13:14.987 --> 01:13:15.955
I don't.

01:13:15.988 --> 01:13:16.822
Um, no, but it's not...

01:13:16.856 --> 01:13:18.623
It's not quite as bad
as it sounds,

01:13:18.657 --> 01:13:19.925
because I just only found out
about the audition

01:13:19.959 --> 01:13:20.826
like 10 minutes ago.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.029
Uh, you've been scheduled
for over a week.

01:13:23.062 --> 01:13:25.965
Okay, um, so well,

01:13:25.998 --> 01:13:27.199
this sounds
really unprofessional

01:13:27.233 --> 01:13:28.667
and doesn't bode well
for my chances

01:13:28.701 --> 01:13:29.702
of getting the part,

01:13:29.735 --> 01:13:33.172
but um, I'm currently
between representation.

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:36.142
So my agent or... well,
not my agent my friend's agent,

01:13:36.175 --> 01:13:37.710
who's nice enough
to send me some projects

01:13:37.743 --> 01:13:39.178
on the side, um,

01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:41.347
sometimes things will
slip through the cracks

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.082
when it's a project pertaining
to me.

01:13:43.115 --> 01:13:44.650
So I think that's what happened.

01:13:44.683 --> 01:13:46.018
You don't have the slides
or anything?

01:13:46.052 --> 01:13:48.687
I... I don't unfortunately,

01:13:48.721 --> 01:13:50.222
but I do know
that it's a romantic film

01:13:50.256 --> 01:13:52.691
and that I'm reading for the...
the love interest.

01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:53.859
Well, Paul, I'm sorry.

01:13:53.893 --> 01:13:55.995
I don't think there's much I can
do for you at this point.

01:13:56.028 --> 01:13:58.798
Okay, um, I'm sorry.

01:13:58.831 --> 01:14:03.035
If you give me one s... just...
I'm so sorry, hold on.

01:14:06.839 --> 01:14:09.241
Okay, hold on, here we go.

01:14:09.275 --> 01:14:10.843
I don't have
a romantic monologue,

01:14:10.876 --> 01:14:12.745
but maybe this will work.

01:14:12.778 --> 01:14:17.650
It's uh, um,
I wrote it to my ex months ago

01:14:17.683 --> 01:14:18.984
and I think
it's probably safe to assume

01:14:19.018 --> 01:14:20.352
I'm never gonna send it.

01:14:22.288 --> 01:14:23.722
Okay.

01:14:23.756 --> 01:14:25.324
Okay.

01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:26.358
Okay.

01:14:36.969 --> 01:14:39.071
"March 10th, 2020.

01:14:40.739 --> 01:14:44.043
Dear Grace,

01:14:44.076 --> 01:14:46.946
I won't take up much
of your time.

01:14:46.979 --> 01:14:47.947
I know
once you've made up your mind,

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.382
There's no changing it.

01:14:50.416 --> 01:14:52.885
What happened?

01:14:52.918 --> 01:14:54.920
We were everything.

01:14:54.954 --> 01:14:57.089
We had everything
in front of us.

01:14:57.123 --> 01:14:59.291
What the fuck happened?

01:14:59.325 --> 01:15:04.096
Sorry, I know you hate it
when I say "fuck".

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:06.198
I know life is strange.

01:15:08.134 --> 01:15:09.835
People get together
because they're the same

01:15:09.869 --> 01:15:12.037
or because they're different

01:15:12.071 --> 01:15:15.341
and they split with them
for the exact same reasons.

01:15:15.374 --> 01:15:17.243
I guess I'll just assume
that's what happened here.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.916
I counted the days
we were together.

01:15:23.949 --> 01:15:26.152
I know
that's a weird thing to do,

01:15:26.185 --> 01:15:28.988
but people do weird things
when they're sad, I guess.

01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:33.058
Two years nine months,

01:15:33.092 --> 01:15:34.393
1,000 days.

01:15:36.495 --> 01:15:40.799
I'm hurt, I'm pissed

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:44.203
not knowing
what could have been.

01:15:44.236 --> 01:15:47.206
1,000 nights
isn't enough for me.

01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:49.241
Maybe it was enough for you.

01:15:51.177 --> 01:15:53.179
I'll always wish for one more.

01:15:53.212 --> 01:15:54.313
Paul."

01:15:56.215 --> 01:15:58.884
Sorry.

01:16:02.288 --> 01:16:04.423
You wrote that for your ex?

01:16:04.456 --> 01:16:07.226
We split up a... a few months ago
and um...

01:16:08.827 --> 01:16:10.162
It's sort of been a hard year
so far,

01:16:10.196 --> 01:16:11.430
I think probably for everybody,

01:16:11.463 --> 01:16:14.967
but uh, it's not easy to move on
when you're social distancing.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.802
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:16:16.835 --> 01:16:17.637
Oh yeah?

01:16:17.671 --> 01:16:19.505
Did you go through a breakup,
too?

01:16:19.538 --> 01:16:21.974
Um, divorce.

01:16:22.007 --> 01:16:24.243
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:16:25.878 --> 01:16:28.480
Uh, Gracie, she uh...

01:16:28.514 --> 01:16:30.015
She got me these
really great tickets

01:16:30.049 --> 01:16:31.317
to go see Sting.

01:16:32.785 --> 01:16:34.753
Uh, I mean
these were amazing seats,

01:16:34.787 --> 01:16:35.754
like right up in there.

01:16:35.788 --> 01:16:37.756
I could have taken his guitar
if I wanted to

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:40.159
um, but there was this...
this intermissions break,

01:16:40.192 --> 01:16:41.026
like in the middle of the show,

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.196
and um, that...
that's where she did it.

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.232
Wait, she broke up with you
at the concert?

01:16:46.265 --> 01:16:48.200
Well, I...
I think she would probably say

01:16:48.234 --> 01:16:50.169
that it was
letting me down easy, you know?

01:16:50.202 --> 01:16:52.037
You gotta gotta give the dog
his favorite treat

01:16:52.071 --> 01:16:53.472
before you put him down.

01:16:55.574 --> 01:16:57.476
Ironically,
Sting is my favorite artist.

01:16:57.509 --> 01:16:59.078
No way, really?

01:16:59.111 --> 01:17:02.014
Yeah, my dad loves Sting.

01:17:02.047 --> 01:17:04.183
When I was little,
I would fall asleep on his chest

01:17:04.216 --> 01:17:06.085
listening to
Ten Summoner's Tales.

01:17:06.118 --> 01:17:08.487
Oh, it's such a good album.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.922
Fuck.

01:17:09.955 --> 01:17:11.123
I actually have
a couple of his guitar picks

01:17:11.156 --> 01:17:12.258
from that show.

01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:13.792
Oh, nice.

01:17:13.826 --> 01:17:15.961
I have a signed shirt
from his Brand New Day tour.

01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:18.330
Oh, well, I have all of his CDs
and most of his cassettes.

01:17:18.364 --> 01:17:21.100
I have all his vinyl.

01:17:21.133 --> 01:17:24.503
Even Love at First Sting?

01:17:24.536 --> 01:17:28.407
Love at First Sting
was a Scorpion's record.

01:17:29.975 --> 01:17:31.877
But you know that.

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:34.046
Touché.

01:17:34.079 --> 01:17:37.483
And that letter you wrote,
that was... that was handwritten?

01:17:37.516 --> 01:17:39.018
Yeah.

01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:41.086
Yeah,
I thought it was more romantic.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.422
Ah, typewriter guy, huh?

01:17:43.455 --> 01:17:44.556
I'm like
a less attractive version

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:46.392
of Colin Firth in Love Actually.

01:17:46.425 --> 01:17:48.160
That's
a criminally underrated film.

01:17:48.193 --> 01:17:49.461
Yes, it is!

01:17:49.495 --> 01:17:51.497
I mean yeah, Richard Curtis
gets all this grief,

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:53.332
because he writes
these romanticized characters,

01:17:53.365 --> 01:17:56.068
but I really appreciate it.

01:17:56.101 --> 01:17:57.970
Well, for what it's worth,

01:17:58.003 --> 01:18:00.572
no one has ever written me
a handwritten letter.

01:18:00.606 --> 01:18:04.043
Oh, well, not sure it counts
if you never send it.

01:18:09.915 --> 01:18:13.152
Uh, anyway, so Paul,

01:18:13.185 --> 01:18:16.088
surprisingly
your audition went very well.

01:18:16.121 --> 01:18:17.122
Oh.

01:18:17.156 --> 01:18:18.157
Oh, thanks.

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:19.558
Uh, I appreciate that.

01:18:19.591 --> 01:18:22.194
Um, why did you get divorced?

01:18:22.227 --> 01:18:23.462
Um...

01:18:23.495 --> 01:18:25.632
I'm sorry, I...
that's really unprofessional.

01:18:25.665 --> 01:18:27.933
I...

01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:30.302
Um...

01:18:30.336 --> 01:18:34.373
You know,
I've thought about it a lot.

01:18:34.406 --> 01:18:39.478
I was young, and naïve,
and I think in the beginning

01:18:39.511 --> 01:18:41.880
I overlooked a lot of things
I shouldn't have,

01:18:41.914 --> 01:18:46.618
because I idealized who he was
in our relationship.

01:18:46.653 --> 01:18:48.354
He was an asshole.

01:18:48.387 --> 01:18:51.990
Yeah, okay, well, he wasn't
always an asshole, right?

01:18:52.024 --> 01:18:53.392
I'm sure there were
some good moments

01:18:53.425 --> 01:18:54.860
between you guys.

01:18:56.328 --> 01:19:00.299
He wanted things out of life
and I wanted things out of life,

01:19:00.332 --> 01:19:02.101
but he didn't want me
to want those things,

01:19:02.134 --> 01:19:05.404
because they didn't align
with his own idealized version

01:19:05.437 --> 01:19:07.039
of our relationship.

01:19:08.407 --> 01:19:11.377
But the assholery
that can be traced back

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:13.345
to the beginning.

01:19:13.379 --> 01:19:16.215
At our wedding,
he took a work call

01:19:16.248 --> 01:19:19.118
right before our first dance.

01:19:19.151 --> 01:19:20.352
Are you... you're serious?

01:19:20.386 --> 01:19:21.153
No, he didn't.

01:19:21.186 --> 01:19:22.154
It happened.

01:19:22.187 --> 01:19:24.691
The song starts,
I go out into the dance floor,

01:19:24.724 --> 01:19:27.559
and I turn around,
and he's outside.

01:19:27.593 --> 01:19:29.461
So I'm just standing there
like an idiot

01:19:29.495 --> 01:19:31.130
in front of everyone.

01:19:31.163 --> 01:19:34.266
Oh, man, that's... that sucks.

01:19:34.299 --> 01:19:37.035
I'm sorry that... that is...
that is dickishness

01:19:37.069 --> 01:19:39.972
on top of the assholery.

01:19:40.005 --> 01:19:42.541
Well, you live and you learn,
right?

01:19:42.574 --> 01:19:45.244
But I... I got to keep the house,
so...

01:19:45.277 --> 01:19:46.713
I mean yeah,
I... sometimes I think

01:19:46.746 --> 01:19:48.180
that the best parts
about breakups

01:19:48.213 --> 01:19:49.548
are the souvenirs, you know?

01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:52.451
Like not... not the house,
but like the you know,

01:19:52.484 --> 01:19:54.186
just the things that
you wind up taking with you.

01:19:54.219 --> 01:19:56.188
The memories, good and bad,

01:19:56.221 --> 01:19:57.990
and then really the scars,
too, though,

01:19:58.023 --> 01:19:59.659
because that's what...

01:19:59.692 --> 01:20:02.729
That's what helps you
maybe love better next time

01:20:02.762 --> 01:20:06.165
and... and not make all the same
fuck-ups.

01:20:06.198 --> 01:20:07.667
You know, I've spent
most of the last year

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.669
feelin' like a fuck-up.

01:20:09.702 --> 01:20:13.105
I think that we're all guilty
of idealizing or romanticizing,

01:20:13.138 --> 01:20:14.440
but I don't think
it's a bad thing.

01:20:14.473 --> 01:20:15.107
No?

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.676
No, I'm doin' it right now.

01:20:19.344 --> 01:20:21.180
Uh,
Richard Curtis knows what's up.

01:20:23.716 --> 01:20:25.451
Well, maybe you're right.

01:20:25.484 --> 01:20:26.552
Maybe.

01:20:27.553 --> 01:20:28.487
Oh, damn.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.656
What?

01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:33.459
I... I'm gettin' a... it says
that my session is ending.

01:20:33.492 --> 01:20:36.028
Yeah, you have to pay for the...

01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:39.666
For the service
to have longer calls.

01:20:39.699 --> 01:20:43.703
I would like to ask you
to reserve more time for me

01:20:43.736 --> 01:20:46.639
in the future, but um,

01:20:46.673 --> 01:20:50.042
I also feel like this was
exactly what it needed to be.

01:20:50.075 --> 01:20:52.144
So let's not ruin it
by romanticizing...

01:20:52.177 --> 01:20:53.212
No, don't say roman...

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.615
I thought I'd converted you.

01:20:58.050 --> 01:20:59.652
Almost.

01:20:59.686 --> 01:21:01.587
Well, look,
I only have a few seconds left,

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.491
so maybe I don't have time,
but um, in case,

01:21:05.524 --> 01:21:08.260
I don't ever see you again,

01:21:08.293 --> 01:21:11.497
I want you to know that this is
how you will forever stay

01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:12.531
in my mind.

01:21:12.564 --> 01:21:13.700
What do you mean?

01:21:17.704 --> 01:21:20.072
So now you don't get to say

01:21:20.105 --> 01:21:21.674
that no one's ever written you
a handwritten letter.

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:24.576
♪ Trusting me like a fool ♪

01:21:25.845 --> 01:21:27.814
Well, fuck.

01:21:27.847 --> 01:21:30.282
♪ Like a fool ♪

01:21:34.219 --> 01:21:36.488
♪ Like a fool ♪

01:21:37.857 --> 01:21:41.226
♪ Like a fool ♪

01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:45.798

01:21:48.835 --> 01:21:50.637
♪ Like a fool ♪

01:21:51.671 --> 01:21:53.272
I'm telling you
I can't see anything

01:21:53.305 --> 01:21:54.774
I'm tellin'...

01:21:54.807 --> 01:21:58.110
I swear these TD effin'
robot overlords are takin' over.

01:21:58.143 --> 01:21:59.311
You can hear me, right?

01:21:59.344 --> 01:22:00.479
That works.

01:22:00.512 --> 01:22:03.181
You have to take it
out of sleep mode to see me,

01:22:03.215 --> 01:22:04.616
so you have to hit sleep mode.

01:22:04.651 --> 01:22:06.285
Hit sleep mode.

01:22:06.318 --> 01:22:08.554
Oh!

01:22:09.288 --> 01:22:10.389
Hey!

01:22:10.422 --> 01:22:11.356
Yes.

01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:12.524
Good Lord, look at you.

01:22:12.558 --> 01:22:15.662
You look exactly like you did
when we talked earlier.

01:22:15.695 --> 01:22:18.430
You however have aged horribly.

01:22:18.463 --> 01:22:21.400
You really need
to use some eye creams

01:22:21.433 --> 01:22:22.735
and different emoluments.

01:22:22.769 --> 01:22:25.537
You're the most
supportive friend that I have.

01:22:25.571 --> 01:22:27.874
You're willing
to make hurtful observations,

01:22:27.907 --> 01:22:31.176
and relay those to my face,
and I appreciate that.

01:22:31.209 --> 01:22:32.110
You're welcome.

01:22:32.144 --> 01:22:33.178
What is this?

01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:35.347
You've had this the whole time.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:36.281
Do you not see it?

01:22:36.315 --> 01:22:38.818
When you... look,
when you're talking to me.

01:22:38.851 --> 01:22:41.119
You also see yourself, too.

01:22:41.153 --> 01:22:43.589
You have to see that, right?

01:22:43.622 --> 01:22:47.192
I do.

01:22:47.225 --> 01:22:51.330
It's a lot less worse than
what's goin' on below frame.

01:22:51.363 --> 01:22:52.799
How's your house this quiet?

01:22:52.832 --> 01:22:54.801
The kids are asleep.

01:22:54.834 --> 01:22:57.469
I bet you love that, huh?

01:22:57.502 --> 01:22:58.905
It's actually
horribly depressing.

01:22:59.906 --> 01:23:02.541
I... why would it be depressing?

01:23:02.574 --> 01:23:05.477
It's like this silence
reminds me of my mortality.

01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:06.679
Yeah.

01:23:07.714 --> 01:23:09.916
And I just think of a time
when they are gone

01:23:09.949 --> 01:23:12.417
and I'm just left alone
with my thoughts.

01:23:13.853 --> 01:23:17.322
Just sort of left staring off
in the mid distance,

01:23:17.356 --> 01:23:20.459
remembering toilet seat art,

01:23:20.492 --> 01:23:24.162
and you know, blanket forts,

01:23:24.196 --> 01:23:27.734
and watching iTunes trailers
all night long,

01:23:27.767 --> 01:23:30.703
because we can't agree
on anything.

01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:36.676
Well, that is very touching
and also wildly depressing.

01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:37.744
That doesn't add up at all,

01:23:37.777 --> 01:23:40.612
because the only advice
you've ever given me is

01:23:40.647 --> 01:23:43.482
"Whatever you do,
don't have children."

01:23:43.515 --> 01:23:44.516
And I stand by that.

01:23:44.549 --> 01:23:48.855
It is a horrible,
beautiful, wonderful nightmare

01:23:48.888 --> 01:23:51.623
that you cannot wake up from.

01:23:51.658 --> 01:23:52.825
You think about your kids
all the time

01:23:52.859 --> 01:23:53.726
and you love 'em for it,

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.696
but you also resent them
at the same time.

01:23:56.729 --> 01:24:00.900
I mean they stress me the F out,
but...

01:24:02.769 --> 01:24:07.506
...my favorite part of the day
is when I put them in bed,

01:24:07.539 --> 01:24:09.976
and I tuck 'em in,

01:24:10.009 --> 01:24:13.578
and I kiss 'em
on their obnoxious faces,

01:24:13.612 --> 01:24:15.514
and they say
"I love you, daddy."

01:24:18.017 --> 01:24:21.654
I don't know.

01:24:21.688 --> 01:24:23.555
But the future, man.

01:24:24.957 --> 01:24:27.794
I mean what am I gonna do
when they're gone?

01:24:27.827 --> 01:24:30.295
'Cause you think
about the future

01:24:30.328 --> 01:24:33.565
and that's the worst,
you know?

01:24:33.598 --> 01:24:34.834
What if they don't come home
for Christmas?

01:24:34.867 --> 01:24:38.705
What if they don't um, uh, call?

01:24:41.908 --> 01:24:43.776
I had that weed earlier.

01:24:45.011 --> 01:24:46.913
It was pineapple surprise.

01:24:49.882 --> 01:24:51.718
And this is the surprise.

01:24:51.751 --> 01:24:53.618
Did you smoke all that you had,

01:24:53.653 --> 01:24:56.288
'cause Jesus Christ,
you are in it right now.

01:24:56.321 --> 01:24:57.957
It has a lot of flavor.

01:25:01.359 --> 01:25:02.829
I didn't want the kids
to find it.

01:25:02.862 --> 01:25:04.630
I'm trying to be a good parent.

01:25:05.631 --> 01:25:09.267
Yeah, well, you're doin' great.

01:25:11.671 --> 01:25:12.672
What?

01:25:12.705 --> 01:25:14.506
Jesus.

01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:17.576
How are you?

01:25:17.609 --> 01:25:18.978
Sober.

01:25:19.011 --> 01:25:21.948
And a little more
emotionally grounded.

01:25:21.981 --> 01:25:23.950
I'm okay.

01:25:23.983 --> 01:25:26.585
Hey, I'm sorry for this tangent.

01:25:26.618 --> 01:25:28.988
I just wanted to call you
to tell you

01:25:29.021 --> 01:25:33.693
that I respect you
for what you did earlier

01:25:33.726 --> 01:25:34.827
about the script.

01:25:34.861 --> 01:25:35.527
Yeah,

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.964
You know, you're a stand-up guy.

01:25:37.997 --> 01:25:41.033
You're an a-hole,
but you're a stand-up a-hole.

01:25:41.067 --> 01:25:44.569
I uh, I called Anna today,
spoke with her.

01:25:44.603 --> 01:25:46.839
Dude, what are you doing?

01:25:46.873 --> 01:25:48.708
You're poking the bear.

01:25:48.741 --> 01:25:50.843
I'm not poking a be...
what is that... what bear?

01:25:50.877 --> 01:25:52.377
The despair.

01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:55.447
The bear of despair,
you're pokin' it.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.382
You sound like a high Dr. Seuss,

01:25:57.415 --> 01:25:58.383
I'm not.

01:25:58.416 --> 01:25:59.819
There's no bear.

01:25:59.852 --> 01:26:01.921
I'm not poking a bear.

01:26:01.954 --> 01:26:04.857
It was just two adults
having a conversation.

01:26:04.891 --> 01:26:07.325
Yeah, you know,

01:26:07.359 --> 01:26:09.829
asleep bears
don't have conversations

01:26:09.862 --> 01:26:11.363
unless you poke 'em.

01:26:13.465 --> 01:26:19.705
It's fine
and I am gonna be making

01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:22.942
another phone call
tonight as well.

01:26:22.975 --> 01:26:25.443
Okay,
I don't wanna know about that,

01:26:25.477 --> 01:26:27.479
because I care about you.

01:26:27.512 --> 01:26:29.581
Also, I wanna shower

01:26:29.614 --> 01:26:32.084
and get this Dorito smell
out of me.

01:26:32.118 --> 01:26:35.587
Yeah, maybe...
maybe wash that shirt as well.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.056
leave that on
when you get in the shower.

01:26:37.089 --> 01:26:40.927
I want you to know
no matter what happens

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.994
with the script...

01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:44.362
Yeah.

01:26:44.396 --> 01:26:45.932
I'm on your side.

01:26:45.965 --> 01:26:47.867
Unless they fire you
and keep me.

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.002
I can always count on you,
Noel.

01:26:50.036 --> 01:26:51.103
Take care, man.

01:26:51.137 --> 01:26:52.138
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

01:26:52.171 --> 01:26:53.471
Get some bear spray.

01:26:53.505 --> 01:26:54.974
Yeah, alright, shut up.

01:27:03.515 --> 01:27:05.885
Hello, friends,

01:27:05.918 --> 01:27:08.788
I've always wanted DJ Satur8
to be a symbol of hope

01:27:08.821 --> 01:27:11.691
amid these darkest of days.

01:27:11.724 --> 01:27:13.659
A symbol
in which we all find something

01:27:13.693 --> 01:27:15.928
in which to connect

01:27:15.962 --> 01:27:18.798
and tonight, I'd like to share

01:27:18.831 --> 01:27:21.834
that same opportunity
to connect with you.

01:27:21.868 --> 01:27:25.403
Below,
you will find an Alicorn link

01:27:25.437 --> 01:27:29.642
for the first time
we can be face-to-face.

01:27:31.811 --> 01:27:34.579
That link is now live.

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:40.953
Wow!

01:27:40.987 --> 01:27:43.488
This is exceptional.

01:27:43.521 --> 01:27:46.424
It's difficult being human.

01:27:46.458 --> 01:27:48.895
The world is changing,

01:27:48.928 --> 01:27:51.463
But there are some things
that remain the same.

01:27:52.798 --> 01:27:55.668
There will always be light

01:27:55.701 --> 01:27:58.971
at the end of the darkness.

01:27:59.005 --> 01:28:01.641
Chances are the perfect melody

01:28:01.674 --> 01:28:05.177
has already been pieced together

01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:08.915
and the right words
have already been written,

01:28:08.948 --> 01:28:12.417
so that you can find your light.

01:28:13.052 --> 01:28:15.688
I suppose my point is

01:28:15.721 --> 01:28:18.858
even DJ Satur8 can admit

01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:20.192
that sometimes

01:28:23.262 --> 01:28:26.899
shit be fucked up,

01:28:26.933 --> 01:28:30.468
but I'ma keep doin' my shit
and that's okay.

01:28:32.905 --> 01:28:35.942
And I hope

01:28:35.975 --> 01:28:38.678
that you find
that same sort of clarity.

01:28:40.913 --> 01:28:43.615
Want an orange, baby bird?

01:29:09.108 --> 01:29:12.712
♪ Oh no, you opened a door ♪

01:29:12.745 --> 01:29:13.980
Hey, mom.

01:29:14.013 --> 01:29:16.248
♪ You might have
opened it wide ♪

01:29:16.282 --> 01:29:19.285
I just think
it's time we end this.

01:29:21.153 --> 01:29:22.021
Is this because I asked you

01:29:22.054 --> 01:29:23.923
to do a three-way
with my step sister?

01:29:25.791 --> 01:29:29.594
Yes, that did play a factor
