(Clattering)

00:58.529 --> 01:00.660
(Slams)

01:00.661 --> 01:02.432
Dr. Gross.

01:02.433 --> 01:04.134
(Mouth full)
Mm-hmm? This is Dani.

01:04.135 --> 01:06.236
She needs help
processing a body.

01:06.237 --> 01:07.337
(Wheels clatter)

01:07.338 --> 01:08.668
Good luck with the new job.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.170
Thanks.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.071
(Sighs)

01:11.072 --> 01:13.173
Hey. I'm Ethan.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.674
You're a doctor? Yeah.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.106
That's impressive.

01:16.107 --> 01:17.107
Thanks.

01:17.108 --> 01:18.508
But you got a little
fruity flake thing

01:18.509 --> 01:21.111
on your collar there, doc.

01:21.112 --> 01:22.782
Okay. So let's see
what you brought me.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.154
(Opens zipper)

01:24.155 --> 01:25.716
Okay.

01:27.518 --> 01:30.089
Wow.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.591
So...

01:31.592 --> 01:34.594
You know how to do this?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.726
On my count.

01:36.727 --> 01:39.169
One, two, three.

01:39.170 --> 01:40.470
(Grunts)

01:40.471 --> 01:43.102
Alex Grant, 28.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.205
Found in hanson park.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.506
Guy was ice cold.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.279
Paramedics think
it was an overdose.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.540
Hmm.

01:50.541 --> 01:53.313
Bet you see some
crazy stuff here, huh?

01:53.314 --> 01:56.146
You get used to it. Don't worry.

01:56.147 --> 01:58.218
I got no problem
being around the dead.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.449
You're not one of those
necro-freaks, are you?

01:59.450 --> 02:00.790
Because we get those.

02:00.791 --> 02:02.222
Relax, doc.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.424
I get my rocks off
the regular way.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.595
Oh, that's good.

02:05.596 --> 02:07.697
I-I mean, that you
get your rocks...

02:07.698 --> 02:09.359
You know what? Forget about it.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.462
Uh, so you're done.
Thanks for coming in.

02:12.463 --> 02:15.605
And I was just
starting to like it here.

02:15.606 --> 02:16.866
Bye.

02:16.867 --> 02:20.270
(Wheels clattering)

02:20.271 --> 02:21.771
Are you kidding me?

02:21.772 --> 02:23.313
That's transpo?

02:23.314 --> 02:25.445
God.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.448
(Sighs)

02:29.750 --> 02:31.751
(Grunts)

02:31.752 --> 02:34.624
(Grunt)

02:34.625 --> 02:36.626
(Exhales)

02:36.627 --> 02:39.159
(Whispers) Let's
see what we got here.

02:41.332 --> 02:43.293
Snaps. Thank you.

02:43.294 --> 02:45.436
(Inhales)

02:47.938 --> 02:49.770
A bullet hole?

02:53.374 --> 02:55.905
Oh, boy.

02:55.906 --> 02:57.447
(Knock on door)

02:57.448 --> 02:59.349
So what's going on
with you and Kate?

02:59.350 --> 03:00.810
What do you mean?

03:00.811 --> 03:02.682
Well, I saw you talking in
the parking lot last night,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.254
and if I didn't know better,
it almost looked friendly.

03:04.255 --> 03:06.256
Why is it that you
are so comfortable

03:06.257 --> 03:08.388
delving into my personal life,

03:08.389 --> 03:10.360
and yet, hmm,

03:10.361 --> 03:11.861
we never seem to
talk about yours?

03:11.862 --> 03:14.224
Well, that's just
our thing, I guess.

03:14.225 --> 03:16.366
(Chuckles) Oh, I see.

03:16.367 --> 03:17.827
You and I have a thing?

03:17.828 --> 03:19.198
(Knock on door)

03:19.199 --> 03:20.370
Uh, we have a problem.

03:20.371 --> 03:22.372
You know that body
that just came in,

03:22.373 --> 03:25.235
the, uh, 28-year-old male,
suspected drug overdose?

03:25.236 --> 03:27.707
He has a gunshot wound
to his upper abdomen.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.280
I'll call bud and Sam and
tell 'em we have a homicide.

03:30.281 --> 03:32.712
(Clicks keypad buttons)

03:32.713 --> 03:35.214
How could the paramedics
have missed a gunshot wound?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.216
Well, the guy looks like a user.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.218
I mean, there wasn't much blood.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.220
To tell you the truth, I
didn't notice it myself

03:41.221 --> 03:44.894
until I started to undress him.

03:44.895 --> 03:47.898
(People speaking indistinctly)

03:49.930 --> 03:51.301
Ethan.

03:51.302 --> 03:54.404
Okay, that's weird.

03:54.405 --> 03:55.905
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

03:55.906 --> 03:58.538
Curtis, what happened
to Ethan's body?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.970
You mean, other than
30 years of junk food,

04:00.971 --> 04:03.373
video games, and
general lethargy?

04:03.374 --> 04:04.514
Oh, yeah. Your body's a temple?

04:04.515 --> 04:06.015
I meant the body
he's working on.

04:06.016 --> 04:07.817
Your new transporter
brought it in.

04:07.818 --> 04:09.649
What now? He lost it?

04:09.650 --> 04:12.653
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

04:14.024 --> 04:15.685
What's going on in here?

04:15.686 --> 04:17.827
Seems Ethan has
misplaced a body.

04:17.828 --> 04:19.689
Oh, wait a minute.
H-How's this on me?

04:19.690 --> 04:21.030
I left him right there.

04:21.031 --> 04:22.862
Well, it's not like it got
up and walked away.

04:22.863 --> 04:26.866
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

04:26.867 --> 04:29.339
Megan, I just got off
the phone with bud...

04:29.340 --> 04:30.970
Ethan.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.843
Yeah?

04:41.812 --> 04:43.313
(Inhales sharply) (Gasps)

04:43.314 --> 04:45.316
The problem might
be the carburetor.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.688
Call an ambulance.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.289
(Emergency radio chatter)

04:50.290 --> 04:52.692
Which one of your people
screwed the pooch on this one?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.694
Hey, it wasn't one of us.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.295
The paramedics on
the scene called it in.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.667
Anyway, these things happen.

04:57.668 --> 04:59.769
It was freezing cold last night.

04:59.770 --> 05:01.601
Given hypothermia,
the heartbeat can drop

05:01.602 --> 05:03.072
to two or three beats a minute.

05:03.073 --> 05:04.904
It's hard to find
a pulse, plus...

05:04.905 --> 05:07.437
It's nice to throw one back.

05:07.438 --> 05:10.009
Let me remind you,
this guy doesn't make it,

05:10.010 --> 05:12.482
I got a murder and no
crime scene, but, hey,

05:12.483 --> 05:13.783
these things happen.

05:13.784 --> 05:15.415
(Elevator bell dings)

05:15.416 --> 05:17.447
(Man) Coming through.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.849
Hey, talk to me.
Who did this to you?

05:19.850 --> 05:21.421
He shot me.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.922
We'll check his dressing
en route? (Man) Yeah.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.394
(Sam) Who shot you?

05:24.395 --> 05:26.396
Who did this?

05:26.397 --> 05:27.897
My...

05:27.898 --> 05:29.529
My roommate Paul.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.330
I came home and...

05:31.331 --> 05:33.332
He shot me.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.406
(Radio chatter continues)

05:36.467 --> 05:39.640
Paul Crawford,
Philly p.D. Open up!

05:41.341 --> 05:42.913
(Police radio chatter)

05:44.344 --> 05:45.675
Philly p.D.!

05:45.676 --> 05:48.017
(Officer shouts indistinctly)

05:48.018 --> 05:50.950
(Radio chatter continues)

05:50.951 --> 05:53.483
(Sighs)

05:53.484 --> 05:54.524
He's not here.

05:54.525 --> 05:56.355
I know. I just got off
the phone with c.I.S.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.528
They picked up a GPS
trace on his cell phone.

05:58.529 --> 05:59.959
He's on the move.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.961
Thanks, fellas. Let's go.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.134
(Sam) Okay, we're close.
Make a right at the corner.

06:05.135 --> 06:06.466
(Tires squeal)

06:06.467 --> 06:07.897
(Engine revs)

06:07.898 --> 06:09.699
Got it. Red s.U.V.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.472
He's making a break for it.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.044
Here we go. Hold on.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.508
Wait a minute. We're
past him. We're past him.

06:18.509 --> 06:19.509
Stop the car.

06:19.510 --> 06:20.910
(Tires squeal)

06:20.911 --> 06:22.412
It's the trash truck.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.083
Got him.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.155
(Engine revs)

06:26.156 --> 06:28.458
(Tires squeal)

06:28.459 --> 06:30.159
Get out of the truck.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.993
Put your hands
on the windshield.

06:35.566 --> 06:36.866
Get out of the cab.
What's going on?

06:36.867 --> 06:38.027
Put your hands
on the windshield.

06:38.028 --> 06:39.469
What did I do? Now!

06:39.470 --> 06:40.431
What did I do?

06:40.432 --> 06:42.902
Right now, hands
on the windshield.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.934
He's not here.

06:44.935 --> 06:48.608
He dumped the phone, and we
were dumb enough to fall for it.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.809
Open up the back.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.911
(Keypad beeps)

06:52.813 --> 06:54.183
(Cell phone rings)

06:54.184 --> 06:55.985
All right, it's ringing.

06:55.986 --> 06:57.447
(Latch clicks)

06:57.448 --> 07:00.450
(Whirring)

07:00.451 --> 07:02.822
(Cell phone rings)

07:02.823 --> 07:03.823
I hear it.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.595
(Ring)

07:05.596 --> 07:07.026
Okay.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.027
(Grunts)

07:08.028 --> 07:09.028
(Ring)

07:09.029 --> 07:10.029
(Grunts)

07:10.030 --> 07:11.861
(Ring)

07:11.862 --> 07:13.703
You can hang up. (Ring)

07:13.704 --> 07:16.166
He's not gonna answer.

07:19.169 --> 07:23.113
(Fabric snaps)

07:31.522 --> 07:33.683
Paul Crawford, he was 27.

07:33.684 --> 07:35.184
Graduated tulane,

07:35.185 --> 07:37.456
staffer for a Philly
city councilwoman.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.529
This guy and Alex
were roommates?

07:39.530 --> 07:40.530
(Chuckles)

07:40.531 --> 07:41.631
You saw Alex...

07:41.632 --> 07:44.033
Dirty hair, ratty
clothes, track marks.

07:44.034 --> 07:46.636
It's kind of hard to imagine
the two of them living together.

07:46.637 --> 07:48.698
Well, maybe he just has bad
luck with roommate roulette.

07:48.699 --> 07:49.839
I won't even tell you
about some of the guys

07:49.840 --> 07:51.200
that I roomed with in college.

07:51.201 --> 07:52.972
Oh, of course not.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.874
Telling me about your life?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.846
That's not ourthing.

07:56.847 --> 07:58.207
Maybe Alex can tell us more

07:58.208 --> 07:59.709
when he gets out
of surgery, huh?

07:59.710 --> 08:02.612
Don't cut into this one
until you're sure he's dead.

08:02.613 --> 08:03.913
Oh, he's dead, all right.

08:03.914 --> 08:06.255
Probably from the
gunshot wound to his chest.

08:06.256 --> 08:09.058
Given the ambient
temperature and the liver temp,

08:09.059 --> 08:11.761
I'd put it between 10:00
and 12:00 last night.

08:11.762 --> 08:13.823
I'm not gonna be able to
give you a slug, though.

08:13.824 --> 08:15.865
Entrance here, exit
through the back.

08:15.866 --> 08:18.528
You find anything that'll tell
us where this guy was killed?

08:18.529 --> 08:20.600
That trash truck
covered a 16-block route

08:20.601 --> 08:22.632
nowhere near his
apartment. Mm-hmm.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.073
We found these.

08:24.074 --> 08:25.675
Probably not from the truck.

08:25.676 --> 08:27.106
They were inside his shoes

08:27.107 --> 08:28.938
and the rolled-up
sleeves of his shirt.

08:28.939 --> 08:31.881
I'll get Ethan to take them
to the lab for identification.

08:31.882 --> 08:34.243
And I'm gonna drive
the trash truck route

08:34.244 --> 08:35.915
just the same.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.818
(People speaking indistinctly)

08:38.819 --> 08:42.151
Okay, got a positive
for gunshot residue.

08:42.152 --> 08:43.823
So Paul here may have shot Alex.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.796
Now who shot Paul?

08:46.797 --> 08:48.097
I have to thank you
for coming down.

08:48.098 --> 08:51.130
As soon I heard, I-I
just had to be here.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.833
I don't know if any of you have
ever worked on a campaign,

08:53.834 --> 08:55.835
but... you bond incredibly

08:55.836 --> 08:57.707
with the people in
the trenches with you.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.809
You... you become family.

08:59.810 --> 09:00.970
Paul was family.

09:00.971 --> 09:03.643
How long had he worked for you?

09:03.644 --> 09:04.974
Almost two years.

09:04.975 --> 09:06.776
He was so bright.

09:06.777 --> 09:08.718
I mean, he didn't miss a thing.

09:08.719 --> 09:11.020
Is there anyone you can think
of that might have done this?

09:11.021 --> 09:13.022
Any enemies or conflicts
he might have had?

09:13.023 --> 09:15.024
Oh, no. No one.

09:15.025 --> 09:16.786
Paul was one of those people

09:16.787 --> 09:20.760
that you can't imagine
rubbing anybody the wrong way.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.332
I often teased him that
he didn't belong in politics.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.894
(Chuckles)

09:24.895 --> 09:26.636
(Sam) Ms. Bennett,
we haven't yet been able

09:26.637 --> 09:28.698
to exactly pinpoint
where Paul was killed.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.870
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone last night?

09:30.871 --> 09:32.872
Any council business?

09:32.873 --> 09:34.874
No.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.606
I'm sorry.

09:36.607 --> 09:38.177
But I can tell
you this, if there is

09:38.178 --> 09:40.049
anythingyou need me to do,

09:40.050 --> 09:42.912
any way to use my
political leverage to help you,

09:42.913 --> 09:44.253
i'm... I'm yours.

09:44.254 --> 09:45.985
Thank you.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.918
(Ethan) Mm.

09:48.959 --> 09:52.262
(Whispers) What is going on?

09:54.925 --> 09:57.197
What is going on here?

10:01.071 --> 10:02.832
What are those?

10:02.833 --> 10:05.935
Uh, I-I don't know yet.

10:05.936 --> 10:07.637
Uh, they were, um,

10:07.638 --> 10:09.038
they found 'em
on a... on a body.

10:09.039 --> 10:11.040
And, uh, if could
figure out what they are,

10:11.041 --> 10:12.742
then I can, you know,

10:12.743 --> 10:14.744
tell where the body originated.

10:14.745 --> 10:15.745
Mm.

10:15.746 --> 10:18.617
What are you doing here?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.720
I got called into
the principal's office.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.722
I don't think
Dr. Brumfield's happy

10:22.723 --> 10:25.695
that I hauled the undead
in here this morning.

10:25.696 --> 10:26.856
That wasn't your fault.

10:26.857 --> 10:28.027
Right?

10:28.028 --> 10:29.258
(Curtis) Oh, no.

10:29.259 --> 10:30.629
Hell, no.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.932
This isn't "project runway."

10:32.933 --> 10:34.964
It's the medical
examiner's office.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.105
Now I can understand the need

10:36.106 --> 10:37.636
for a little personal
expression.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.869
Take my neckties,
for instance... Yeah.

10:39.870 --> 10:43.642
Or Ethan's unnaturally
large head of hair.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.414
But this? Mnh-mnh.
It's too much.

10:45.415 --> 10:47.747
Curtis, I think she
looks cool. You look cool.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.218
No, look, I totally get it.

10:49.219 --> 10:50.950
I'll fix it. I promise.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.251
Good. Now about this morning...

10:52.252 --> 10:54.253
Wait. That wasn't her fault.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.955
No, it wasn't.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.688
Problem is, though, when
people hear about a live body

10:58.689 --> 11:00.029
ending up in the morgue,

11:00.030 --> 11:02.091
they all assume it's our fault,

11:02.092 --> 11:04.363
which is why my
transporters always make sure

11:04.364 --> 11:05.995
the paramedics double-check.

11:05.996 --> 11:07.897
I got it.

11:07.898 --> 11:09.398
I won't even zip up the bag
till I'm sure the body's dead.

11:09.399 --> 11:12.002
You won't even
load the bag. Clear?

11:13.243 --> 11:14.373
Good.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.377
Now get back to work.

11:25.055 --> 11:28.287
Boy, please. She'll break
your skinny ass in half.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.989
(Laughs)

11:29.990 --> 11:31.420
(Sam) Two roommates,

11:31.421 --> 11:33.422
both shot, gotta
be related, right?

11:33.423 --> 11:35.364
Well, Alex said
he was shot here.

11:35.365 --> 11:37.126
Paul? Who knows?

11:37.127 --> 11:40.771
That trash truck never came
within 10 miles of this place.

11:42.302 --> 11:45.204
(Chuckles) It's like a real-life
Felix and Oscar in here.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.776
Who?

11:46.777 --> 11:48.437
Felix unger, Oscar
Madison... "the odd couple."

11:48.438 --> 11:50.740
Okay. So what's your point?

11:50.741 --> 11:52.982
Whatever trouble came
and found these two,

11:52.983 --> 11:55.384
you can bet it came
from Alex's world.

11:55.385 --> 11:58.087
He's the Oscar in this equation.

11:58.088 --> 12:00.089
He's the one we
should be looking at.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.091
(Chuckles) Maybe.

12:02.092 --> 12:04.154
But look what Paul's got.

12:05.996 --> 12:07.496
You have any idea
when we'll have

12:07.497 --> 12:08.998
Paul Crawford's medical records?

12:08.999 --> 12:10.499
I am trying, but he's
from New Orleans,

12:10.500 --> 12:12.061
so getting any
information on anything

12:12.062 --> 12:14.063
that predates Katrina
is almost impossible.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.364
Why, what's wrong?

12:15.365 --> 12:17.136
Oh, there's no mystery
about cause of death,

12:17.137 --> 12:19.839
but I'm finding a whole
host of things I can't explain,

12:19.840 --> 12:22.011
like lymphadenopathy,
splenic infarcts,

12:22.012 --> 12:23.512
a well-healed scar...

12:23.513 --> 12:25.344
(Elevator bell dings)
On his upper right chest...

12:25.345 --> 12:26.515
(woman) Hi, Peter!

12:26.516 --> 12:27.917
(Woman) There he is.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.378
(Women speaking indistinctly)

12:29.379 --> 12:31.120
Look at how good you look.

12:31.121 --> 12:32.121
(Laughs)

12:32.122 --> 12:33.252
Who are they?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.885
My sisters. Excuse me.

12:35.886 --> 12:38.227
Oh, not in a million years.

12:38.228 --> 12:40.089
Peter. Hi.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.090
Oh, it's so good to see you. Hi.

12:41.091 --> 12:42.291
Hello. Hi.

12:42.292 --> 12:44.433
What are you doing here?
You shoulda called me. Hi.

12:44.434 --> 12:46.095
Nonsense.

12:46.096 --> 12:48.067
It'swonderful that
you're here. (Chuckles)

12:48.068 --> 12:51.040
Hi, I'm Megan.
I-I work with Peter.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.271
Oh, nice to meet you.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.803
I'm Libby, and this is Diane...

12:53.804 --> 12:55.144
Hi. And Nancy.

12:55.145 --> 12:56.205
Hello. Hi.

12:56.206 --> 12:58.047
Hi. We're sorry
to interrupt, really,

12:58.048 --> 12:59.879
but Peter doesn't return
our calls or e-mails...

12:59.880 --> 13:02.852
(Diane) So we had no choice
other than to show up in person.

13:02.853 --> 13:05.184
Wow. Sounds
like an intervention.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.917
Well, it is, of sorts.

13:07.918 --> 13:09.989
Okay, look, I'm really
sorry I didn't return your call,

13:09.990 --> 13:11.991
but I will call you
tonight. I promise, okay?

13:11.992 --> 13:14.523
Oh, no, no, no,
Peter. This is family.

13:14.524 --> 13:17.967
You're always telling
me how importantfamilyis.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.368
(Megan laughs)

13:19.369 --> 13:21.470
Okay, so what is so urgent

13:21.471 --> 13:23.833
that you needed to
come here and see me?

13:23.834 --> 13:25.134
(Whispers) You do it.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.036
You'll never guess
who's back in town.

13:27.037 --> 13:29.378
Lizzy d'Marco.

13:29.379 --> 13:31.380
She's only here for
three days, Peter.

13:31.381 --> 13:33.012
So you have to act quickly.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.383
Who is lizzy d'Marco?

13:34.384 --> 13:35.915
Just a girl I dated.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.486
(Nancy) Oh, no, don't
listen to him, Megan.

13:37.487 --> 13:40.149
Lizzy was Peter's great love.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.350
Okay. Come on.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.052
She's the one that got away.

13:43.053 --> 13:45.194
Really? (Libby, Nancy,
and Diane) Mm-hmm.

13:45.195 --> 13:46.495
Oh. I'm sorry to interrupt.

13:46.496 --> 13:48.397
Hi. Hi. Hi.

13:48.398 --> 13:49.598
What do you got?

13:49.599 --> 13:51.130
You wanted to know
as soon as I indentified it.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.231
It's, uh, it's infill.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.233
It's used in artificial turf.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.065
Wait a second. I drove
the trash truck route,

13:56.066 --> 13:58.968
and there's a new
school being built

13:58.969 --> 14:00.439
with artificial turf
on the playground.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.271
Okay, I really have
to go now, okay?

14:02.272 --> 14:04.013
I'm sorry. I'll call you.

14:04.014 --> 14:05.014
Bye. (Mouths words)

14:05.015 --> 14:06.345
Call. Call later.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.947
Okay. Bye.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.848
Bye. Bye.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.450
This is so not over.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.285
You do realize
that, don't you? Mm.

14:18.488 --> 14:22.161
(Man shouts indistinctly)

14:22.162 --> 14:24.063
Hey.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.464
The dumpsters are over here.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.468
(People speaking indistinctly)

14:30.140 --> 14:32.141
(Lid clanks)

14:32.142 --> 14:33.642
They're already half full again.

14:33.643 --> 14:35.244
Can I help you?

14:35.245 --> 14:36.405
Yeah.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.407
Did you have any men
on this site last night

14:38.408 --> 14:40.109
between 10:00 and 12:00?

14:40.110 --> 14:42.281
These guys are
on the clock till 5:00.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.154
At 5:01, this place
is a ghost town.

14:45.155 --> 14:46.956
Can I ask why you're interested?

14:46.957 --> 14:48.587
There may have
been a murder here.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.888
A murder?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.160
Yeah.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.963
(Peter) I think I got blood.

14:53.964 --> 14:55.294
Excuse me.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.967
(Clanks)

14:58.528 --> 15:01.200
Could be from one of
the construction workers.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.902
Yeah, it could be.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.903
(Camera shutter clicks)

15:04.904 --> 15:07.906
(Plastic crinkling)

15:07.907 --> 15:09.238
(Peter and Morris
speak indistinctly)

15:09.239 --> 15:11.311
Hey, guys.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.445
This can't be a coincidence.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.428
I don't like being lied to.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.530
All right, could we
just use a little finesse?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.232
Please. Thank you.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.964
Could you please
tell the councilwoman

15:34.965 --> 15:36.966
Dr. Murphy's here with
detectives Morris and baker? Yes.

15:36.967 --> 15:38.467
Thank you.

15:38.468 --> 15:41.471
(Indistinct conversations)

15:45.145 --> 15:47.176
You smell that?

15:47.177 --> 15:49.118
Mm. Guess our busy civil servant

15:49.119 --> 15:51.950
still finds time to
have her nails done.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.682
I'm sorry. I'm in a meeting.

15:53.683 --> 15:55.184
Emily Burrows,

15:55.185 --> 15:56.525
councilwoman
Bennett's chief of staff.

15:56.526 --> 15:58.557
So what can we do for
you? Is there any news?

15:58.558 --> 15:59.728
(Morris) Actually, yes.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.690
It turns out that Paul
may have been killed

16:01.691 --> 16:03.432
at the new school.

16:03.433 --> 16:06.265
You know, the one with
your picture right out front?

16:06.266 --> 16:08.137
(Sam) So we're wondering
why you didn't mention it

16:08.138 --> 16:11.170
when I asked if Paul had any
district business in the area.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.702
I guess I-I didn't even
want to consider it.

16:13.703 --> 16:15.644
Well, you said Paul may
have been killed there.

16:15.645 --> 16:18.247
It's not definitive. My office is
analyzing blood found there.

16:18.248 --> 16:19.578
Then I hope we can avoid

16:19.579 --> 16:21.450
any element of press
involvement until you're sure.

16:21.451 --> 16:23.152
(Cell phone rings)

16:23.153 --> 16:24.983
(Councilwoman Bennett)
Uh, I'm sorry. It's the mayor.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.716
I'm sure he wants to
extend his condolences.

16:27.717 --> 16:29.258
You know, th-there's something

16:29.259 --> 16:31.490
I've been thinking
about all morning.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.022
There was a man who came in here

16:33.023 --> 16:34.363
a couple of times
to talk to Paul,

16:34.364 --> 16:37.666
and Paul seemed
pretty shaken up after.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.100
(Morris) That camera work?

16:41.471 --> 16:43.433
(Kate) He doesn't look friendly.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.577
Whoa. Freeze it.

16:48.578 --> 16:50.139
(Clicks keyboard keys)

16:50.140 --> 16:51.580
I know that guy.

16:51.581 --> 16:54.183
Name's Mike vranitch.

16:54.184 --> 16:56.585
Loan-sharking,
numbers, extortion...

16:56.586 --> 16:58.447
He does it all.

16:58.448 --> 16:59.748
Did you ever ask Paul

16:59.749 --> 17:01.520
what these meetings were about?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.453
He just said it had something
to do with his roommate Alex.

17:04.454 --> 17:06.255
What did I tell you?

17:06.256 --> 17:07.556
(Inhales)

17:07.557 --> 17:09.129
(Exhales)

17:10.530 --> 17:12.531
So did the, uh, lab

17:12.532 --> 17:14.533
get anything from the
blood from the dumpster?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.535
Yeah, it... it's a
type match for Paul,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.237
but... but that's
hardly conclusive.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.640
I mean, he's o positive,
along with 40% of the world.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.212
So you got 'em
checking the d.N.A...

17:23.213 --> 17:25.744
Yeah, yeah. (Italian accent)
You know me. I do my work.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.447
Did you call lizzy d'Marco?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.619
Are you really gonna do this?

17:30.620 --> 17:33.382
Kinda promised your sisters.

17:33.383 --> 17:36.085
(Normal voice) Wait, wait,
wait. Who's lizzy d'Marco?

17:36.086 --> 17:37.756
Just a girl I
dated, years ago...

17:37.757 --> 17:40.389
Oh, unh, unh, unh. She
was Peter's great love.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.560
(Gasps) Oh.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.262
Okay, so she was my great love.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.563
It was the best year of my life,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.265
until her job took
her to Boston.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.566
End of story.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.697
Oh, Peter,

17:48.698 --> 17:50.299
that's not the end of the story.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.300
It's not.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.272
She's back in town and...

17:53.273 --> 17:54.603
She's single.

17:54.604 --> 17:55.644
Yes.

17:55.645 --> 17:57.806
What are you finding with Paul?

17:57.807 --> 17:59.648
I am not entirely sure.

17:59.649 --> 18:01.780
It might be an infection,
or mononucleosis,

18:01.781 --> 18:04.583
or maybe he was
just a raging alcoholic.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.084
Whoa. Squeaky clean Paul?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.086
Well... We all have our secrets.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.389
I mean, look at you and...

18:10.390 --> 18:12.321
(Whispers) Lizzy d'Marco.

18:12.322 --> 18:14.092
(Whispers) You
should ask her out.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.264
What... just take her out.

18:15.265 --> 18:16.525
Okay, just... (Cell phone rings)

18:16.526 --> 18:17.566
(Normal voice) Come
on. You know you...

18:17.567 --> 18:19.568
That's the hospital.

18:19.569 --> 18:21.270
Alex is out of surgery.

18:21.271 --> 18:23.272
The bullet nicked
his transverse colon.

18:23.273 --> 18:24.603
Otherwise, no real damage.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.605
He should be fine
in a day or two.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.407
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.808
Thanks, Scott.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.610
Hmm.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.313
Looks like a .25.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.685
The gun in Paul's
drawer was a .22.

18:36.686 --> 18:39.548
Maybe Paul didn't shoot Alex.

18:39.549 --> 18:41.550
Let's ask him.

18:41.551 --> 18:42.851
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:42.852 --> 18:45.294
Alex, wake up, buddy.

18:45.295 --> 18:46.755
(Taps table) Wake up.

18:46.756 --> 18:48.227
Come on, pal. (Taps)

18:48.228 --> 18:49.528
Wake up.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.759
Uh, whoa, whoa.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.702
I learned a little trick
from an anesthesiologist.

18:53.703 --> 18:56.765
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

18:56.766 --> 18:58.807
(Beeping continues)

18:58.808 --> 19:00.669
(Lowered voice) Alex, sweetie.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.611
(Beeping continues)

19:02.612 --> 19:04.613
Time to go to school.

19:04.614 --> 19:06.175
Breakfast is ready.

19:06.176 --> 19:09.649
(Beeping continues)

19:11.221 --> 19:13.382
Alex...

19:13.383 --> 19:15.384
You're in the hospital.
You've been shot,

19:15.385 --> 19:16.685
but you're gonna be okay.

19:16.686 --> 19:18.287
Alex, we need to know,

19:18.288 --> 19:20.459
do you remember what happened?

19:20.460 --> 19:21.930
(Mutters) I don't know.

19:21.931 --> 19:23.732
I don't know. I came home late.

19:23.733 --> 19:25.594
I locked the door. I walked in.

19:25.595 --> 19:27.496
I hadn't even turned on
the light when... when...

19:27.497 --> 19:29.498
When bam, I got... I got
shot. (Morris) Mm-hmm.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.340
I don't... i don't remember much

19:31.341 --> 19:33.242
after I stumbled
back outside, I guess.

19:33.243 --> 19:35.244
You told us earlier
that Paul shot you.

19:35.245 --> 19:36.705
Did you actually see him?

19:36.706 --> 19:38.947
It... it... it was dark.

19:38.948 --> 19:40.679
But did you see him?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.811
I don't know, man. Why don't
you ask him what happened?

19:42.812 --> 19:44.513
Because Paul is dead.

19:44.514 --> 19:47.756
He was shot last night.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.258
(Sam) Mike vranitch...

19:49.259 --> 19:50.819
What's he got to
do with all this?

19:50.820 --> 19:52.561
Are you in some kind of trouble?

19:52.562 --> 19:54.363
I don't want to talk anymore.
(Monitor beeping rapidly)

19:54.364 --> 19:55.564
Alex, Paul is dead
because of you, isn't he?

19:55.565 --> 19:56.895
I said I don't
want to talk to you.

19:56.896 --> 19:57.896
I want you out.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.728
Enough.

19:59.729 --> 20:01.830
Enough for now.

20:01.831 --> 20:03.802
(Beeping continues)

20:03.803 --> 20:06.806
(Beeping normalizes)

20:09.579 --> 20:12.281
(Man speaks indistinctly)

20:12.282 --> 20:14.783
(Siren wailing)

20:14.784 --> 20:16.214
Mrs. Vranitch.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.516
(Wailing continues)

20:17.517 --> 20:18.717
We're looking for Mikey.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.888
Know where he is?

20:19.889 --> 20:21.219
Cops, right?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.752
Why you gotta
always hassle Mikey?

20:23.753 --> 20:25.924
My son is a businessman.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.496
He tries to help the
people around here

20:27.497 --> 20:28.757
when no one else will.

20:28.758 --> 20:31.460
Alex Grant owed
Mike money, didn't he?

20:31.461 --> 20:33.231
Why would I know
Mikey's business?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.533
Oh, I don't know.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.305
Maybe 'cause it's
a family business.

20:36.306 --> 20:38.006
You been here,
what, 40 years, right?

20:38.007 --> 20:40.008
Never had any competition
in the neighborhood.

20:40.009 --> 20:42.371
Even when I was a kid,

20:42.372 --> 20:45.474
other shops that opened
up went away real quick

20:45.475 --> 20:47.276
or they burned down.

20:47.277 --> 20:48.517
Yeah.

20:48.518 --> 20:50.679
I know you, don't I?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.781
You grew up around here.

20:52.782 --> 20:54.453
Yeah, that's right.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.455
And I've known Mikey
long enough to know him

20:56.456 --> 20:58.327
for exactly who he is.

20:58.328 --> 21:00.689
Gonna be a lot easier on him

21:00.690 --> 21:01.990
and maybe safer

21:01.991 --> 21:04.894
if you just let us know
where to find him.

21:11.741 --> 21:14.643
Hey.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.446
How's that brother
of yours doing?

21:19.809 --> 21:22.852
Tell Mikey we're
looking for him, okay?

21:28.858 --> 21:31.620
Hey. I thought you'd left.

21:31.621 --> 21:33.492
Long day, huh?

21:33.493 --> 21:35.494
Yeah. Ethan said the lab's close

21:35.495 --> 21:37.696
to getting the d.N.A.
Results from the school,

21:37.697 --> 21:39.998
so I just thought
I'd wait it out.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.771
I keep thinking
about Alex and Paul.

21:42.772 --> 21:44.873
It's strange, the...

21:44.874 --> 21:47.336
Dissimilarities.

21:47.337 --> 21:50.339
How do they fit?

21:50.340 --> 21:51.840
You know, how could Paul

21:51.841 --> 21:53.842
put up with someone
like that for so long?

21:53.843 --> 21:56.785
I mean, he's been
literally bailing out the guy

21:56.786 --> 21:58.487
for the past ten years.

21:58.488 --> 22:00.449
He might have even died

22:00.450 --> 22:02.491
because of their friendship.

22:02.492 --> 22:05.954
What's the connection?
What's the bond?

22:05.955 --> 22:09.458
Lab just came back
with the d.N.A. Results.

22:09.459 --> 22:10.929
Is it Paul's blood?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.431
Yes, but not just Paul's.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.933
There were two distinct
d.N.A. Signatures.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.105
So the other has
to be the killer's.

22:17.106 --> 22:18.106
Mike vranitch.

22:18.107 --> 22:19.408
No.

22:19.409 --> 22:21.410
The other d.N.A.
Belongs to the roommate...

22:21.411 --> 22:22.812
Alex Grant.

22:36.626 --> 22:38.987
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:38.988 --> 22:41.630
Morning, sunshine.

22:41.631 --> 22:42.791
(Clicks)

22:42.792 --> 22:44.633
Hey, what the hell, man?

22:44.634 --> 22:46.465
Take these off!

22:46.466 --> 22:47.836
(Sam) Paul didn't shoot you.

22:47.837 --> 22:49.137
It was the other way
around, wasn't it?

22:49.138 --> 22:50.138
No way.

22:50.139 --> 22:51.500
(Chuckles) Way.

22:51.501 --> 22:52.801
You got sloppy, Alex,

22:52.802 --> 22:54.643
the same as you've
been your whole life.

22:54.644 --> 22:56.805
You left blood at the
school where Paul was shot.

22:56.806 --> 22:58.577
D.n.a.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.779
No, that can't be right. I've
never been to any school.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.781
You know what?
Cut the crap, man.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.383
Your blood and Paul's
at the scene of the crime...

23:05.384 --> 23:06.815
(Chuckles) That's a
prosecutor's wet dream.

23:06.816 --> 23:09.017
There's not a jury in the
world won't convict on that.

23:09.018 --> 23:11.620
You owe vranitch money.

23:11.621 --> 23:13.622
My guess is, you went to Paul,

23:13.623 --> 23:15.624
expecting him to bail
you out, as always.

23:15.625 --> 23:18.096
But for once, he said no.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.669
Is that why you killed him?

23:20.670 --> 23:21.970
(Beeping continues)

23:21.971 --> 23:24.433
Maybe vranitch was
the one who shot you.

23:24.434 --> 23:25.704
Who knows?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.405
Maybe you even shot yourself.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.937
But either way,

23:28.938 --> 23:31.009
we have got you
for Paul's murder.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.681
So hurry up.

23:32.682 --> 23:34.643
Get well soon.

23:34.644 --> 23:37.647
(Beeping continues)

23:41.591 --> 23:43.592
The senseless murder

23:43.593 --> 23:45.494
of my beloved staff member

23:45.495 --> 23:48.497
and colleague, Paul Crawford,

23:48.498 --> 23:50.929
is not going to be a
scar upon this school.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.801
Nor will it dampen my commitment

23:52.802 --> 23:54.803
to better education
in this district...

23:54.804 --> 23:55.834
Dr. Murphy,

23:55.835 --> 23:58.136
obviously, the councilwoman
is busy at the moment.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.668
I thought she didn't
want any press.

23:59.669 --> 24:00.869
Now she's called a
press conference?

24:00.870 --> 24:02.511
We need to stay ahead of this.

24:02.512 --> 24:03.712
Far too much of
our political future

24:03.713 --> 24:05.043
is tied to this school.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.015
(Councilwoman Bennett)
Tireless dedication,

24:07.016 --> 24:08.847
which is why I'm
happy to announce

24:08.848 --> 24:10.779
that there's been an
arrest in Paul's murder.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.050
What?

24:12.051 --> 24:13.782
Further, I want to
credit the m.E.'S office

24:13.783 --> 24:16.124
for helping to break the case
by finding d.N.A. Evidence

24:16.125 --> 24:17.856
which led to the suspect...

24:17.857 --> 24:19.187
What the hell is she doing?

24:19.188 --> 24:20.759
He hasn't even been
formally charged yet.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.991
I'm sorry. It's just politics.

24:22.992 --> 24:24.863
New students.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.035
Further, I want to
personally thank

24:27.036 --> 24:30.539
everyone who's been
involved in this amazing project.

24:30.540 --> 24:31.700
Thank you.

24:31.701 --> 24:32.842
(Applause)

24:34.173 --> 24:36.675
That was incredibly
premature and irresponsible.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.907
You may well have just
jeopardized this entire case.

24:38.908 --> 24:41.750
You have your d.N.A
evidence, don't you?

24:41.751 --> 24:44.082
Then the suspect's
guilty. End of story.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.484
Excuse me.

24:49.759 --> 24:51.259
(People speaking indistinctly)

24:51.260 --> 24:53.161
You her new obsession, you know?

24:53.162 --> 24:54.863
You and that old flame of yours.

24:54.864 --> 24:56.795
I am not obsessed.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.667
Wait a second. You
told Curtis about lizzy?

24:58.668 --> 24:59.968
(Curtis, singsongy) Mm-hmm.

24:59.969 --> 25:02.500
I've been looking at
infarcted spleens for an hour.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.972
I needed a distraction.

25:03.973 --> 25:05.834
You do know that we
solved this case, right?

25:05.835 --> 25:08.006
We know what killed Paul.
We know who killed Paul.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.878
Oh, he just had
so much going on...

25:09.879 --> 25:11.640
Lung lesions, diffuse
lymphadenopathy

25:11.641 --> 25:14.783
and my stains are positive
for Epstein-barr virus.

25:14.784 --> 25:16.845
If you ask me,
you don't call her.

25:16.846 --> 25:19.017
I didn't ask you, Curtis.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.248
Oh, I know.

25:20.249 --> 25:22.520
But here's the
thing... Your first love

25:22.521 --> 25:25.023
gotta be some of the most
precious memories you have,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.856
valuable memories
you'll carry your whole life.

25:27.857 --> 25:30.098
Who knows? Might even
be all you have someday.

25:30.099 --> 25:31.800
Oh, thank you for that.

25:31.801 --> 25:33.832
So let's say you
call her, you go out.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.635
Maybe time hasn't
been good to her

25:36.636 --> 25:37.936
or the date doesn't go well.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.968
Poof! Your memories are tainted.

25:39.969 --> 25:42.110
They're ruined...
Forever, Peter.

25:42.111 --> 25:44.142
(Slaps book) It's rejection.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.745
I didn't say the man
was gonna be rejected.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.016
No, not Peter.

25:48.017 --> 25:49.718
Paul Crawford.

25:49.719 --> 25:51.119
He had an organ transplant.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.022
The transplant has been
quietly rejecting his body.

25:54.023 --> 25:56.284
It's p.T.L.D. It's so rare.

25:56.285 --> 25:58.056
Wait. If Paul had a
transplanted organ,

25:58.057 --> 26:00.258
you would've picked
that up in autopsy, right?

26:00.259 --> 26:02.731
Only his transplant
wasn't a solid organ.

26:02.732 --> 26:04.893
It's bone marrow.

26:04.894 --> 26:07.196
We gotta get to the hospital.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.299
I'm telling you, Peter.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.242
Too late. I already called her.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.976
Get the cuffs off him.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.980
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:22.652 --> 26:24.653
No! What the hell are you doing?

26:24.654 --> 26:25.884
I want to see the scar again.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.156
(Handcuffs clicking) I
know what you did for Paul.

26:28.157 --> 26:31.861
(Beeping continues)

26:34.764 --> 26:36.224
He was dying, wasn't he?

26:36.225 --> 26:38.997
What was it, leukemia?

26:38.998 --> 26:41.700
Yeah, I didn't... I
didn't even know Paul.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.171
And yet you donated
the bone marrow

26:43.172 --> 26:45.003
that saved his life.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.675
Our parents went
to the same church.

26:46.676 --> 26:48.977
When he got sick, seems like

26:48.978 --> 26:52.010
everybody in town got tested
to see if they could be a donor.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.882
And you were a match.

26:53.883 --> 26:54.883
(Beeping continues)

26:54.884 --> 26:56.815
And after...

26:56.816 --> 26:57.986
When he got better,

26:57.987 --> 26:59.888
he always acted
as if he owed me.

26:59.889 --> 27:01.920
So that's why Paul
looked out for you?

27:01.921 --> 27:03.922
That was the bond,
the connection?

27:03.923 --> 27:05.694
Yeah.

27:05.695 --> 27:08.056
And I took of advantage of it.

27:08.057 --> 27:10.198
'Cause no matter what,
I knew he'd be there.

27:10.199 --> 27:12.130
But there isno way

27:12.131 --> 27:14.632
I would ever kill him.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.364
Alex, I know that.

27:16.365 --> 27:18.967
But the cops, they... they
say they have my d.N.A.

27:18.968 --> 27:22.070
That's because of the
bone marrow transplant.

27:22.071 --> 27:24.943
Paul's body carried
two types of d.N.A...

27:24.944 --> 27:26.344
His and yours.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.016
The only blood at
the scene was Paul's.

27:28.017 --> 27:29.718
It doesn't tie you to anything.

27:29.719 --> 27:30.879
No.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.751
He's still dead because of me.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.982
How? What do you mean?

27:33.983 --> 27:37.025
The money I owe.

27:37.026 --> 27:38.256
Paul went to vranitch

27:38.257 --> 27:41.259
and said that he'd
assume the debt, so...

27:41.260 --> 27:42.891
It's still my fault.

27:42.892 --> 27:46.795
(Beeping continues)

27:46.796 --> 27:48.897
(Man speaks indistinctly)

27:48.898 --> 27:50.739
Sure wish Dr. Hunt had
blown up our case tomorrow

27:50.740 --> 27:52.170
rather than tonight.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.272
I had dinner plans with Jeannie.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.374
(Men speaking indistinctly)

27:56.375 --> 27:58.707
Tough place to grow up.

27:58.708 --> 28:00.979
Yeah, in some ways.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.752
I mean, we had good times.

28:03.753 --> 28:06.885
But, uh, yeah, there were
a lot of bad influences.

28:06.886 --> 28:10.158
Drugs, gangs, you
know, that kind of thing.

28:10.159 --> 28:12.861
How did you escape?

28:12.862 --> 28:15.223
Escape? (Chuckles)

28:15.224 --> 28:17.065
(Both laugh)

28:17.066 --> 28:19.427
(Sighs) I guess my mom, really.

28:19.428 --> 28:20.799
Mm.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.331
You know, she made sure
we stayed outta trouble.

28:23.332 --> 28:25.734
We had curfew,

28:25.735 --> 28:27.035
chores.

28:27.036 --> 28:29.077
(Chuckles) That woman literally

28:29.078 --> 28:31.039
followed us to school every day.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.041
(Laughs)

28:33.042 --> 28:36.084
A lot of good it did my brother.

28:36.085 --> 28:37.817
What happened to your brother?

28:40.489 --> 28:42.720
He was, uh... killed,

28:42.721 --> 28:45.193
right around the
corner from here.

28:45.194 --> 28:48.096
He was, um, walking
home from work one night.

28:48.097 --> 28:51.160
Somebody rolled
up on him, shot him.

28:54.063 --> 28:55.864
They catch the guy?

28:55.865 --> 28:58.007
Yeah, they caught him.

28:59.308 --> 29:01.269
To this day, I've never known

29:01.270 --> 29:03.341
the reason why it happened,

29:03.342 --> 29:05.774
but...

29:05.775 --> 29:07.146
They caught him.

29:11.881 --> 29:14.853
(Bell on door jingles)

29:14.854 --> 29:16.826
(Morris) Is that him?

29:18.157 --> 29:20.990
Always knew he was a mama's boy.

29:22.992 --> 29:26.134
(Clicking)

29:26.135 --> 29:28.436
Looks like you had a
good day today, huh, ma?

29:28.437 --> 29:30.768
Mikey, cops.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.071
(Closes cash register drawer)

29:38.207 --> 29:39.407
Ohh!

29:39.408 --> 29:40.408
(Grunts)

29:40.409 --> 29:42.210
Come on.

29:42.211 --> 29:43.451
What the hell is this?

29:43.452 --> 29:46.215
This is you and me,
Mikey, having a reunion.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.798
Mikey, we got video of you

30:00.799 --> 30:02.100
threatening Paul Crawford.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.801
So what?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.803
So Paul was killed
a couple nights ago.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.805
His roommate Alex was shot, too.

30:07.806 --> 30:08.937
I heard.

30:08.938 --> 30:10.438
So what?

30:10.439 --> 30:11.940
They owed you money.

30:11.941 --> 30:13.441
Then why would I kill 'em?

30:13.442 --> 30:14.943
Where would the
profit be in that?

30:14.944 --> 30:15.944
I don't know.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.946
Maybe you wanted
to send a message

30:17.947 --> 30:20.018
to folks who might
be a little behind,

30:20.019 --> 30:21.990
remind 'em what a
tough guy you are.

30:21.991 --> 30:23.491
You know, I always thought

30:23.492 --> 30:26.154
you'd end up being
something better than this.

30:26.155 --> 30:27.595
Funny. (Chuckles)

30:27.596 --> 30:29.297
You're exactly what
I figured you'd be.

30:29.298 --> 30:30.999
Well, I'm still here,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.861
which is a lot more
than we can say

30:32.862 --> 30:34.964
for that sad-ass
brother of yours.

30:36.405 --> 30:38.036
(Thud) Oh!

30:38.037 --> 30:40.038
Keep talking, Mikey. (Grunts)

30:40.039 --> 30:41.910
Say something else
about my partner's brother.

30:41.911 --> 30:44.372
(Pants) Look, I was
playing cards two nights ago.

30:44.373 --> 30:47.415
I got at least a dozen
guys who can alibi me.

30:47.416 --> 30:50.318
All right. Come on.

30:50.319 --> 30:52.020
Get him outta here.

30:52.021 --> 30:53.151
(Handcuffs click)

30:53.152 --> 30:56.324
(Engine turns over)

30:56.325 --> 30:58.057
(Door closes)

31:02.161 --> 31:04.262
Thanks for that.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.264
Oh, I figured I was
doing him a favor,

31:06.265 --> 31:08.636
saving him from you.

31:08.637 --> 31:10.638
I guess I should've told you

31:10.639 --> 31:13.041
about my brother before.

31:13.042 --> 31:15.104
Don't know why I didn't.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.376
You told me now.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.950
(Pats arm)

31:28.387 --> 31:31.059
Hope you don't
think I'm stalking you.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.621
Uh, uh... no.

31:33.622 --> 31:36.264
Usually my stalkers are older,

31:36.265 --> 31:38.366
larger, more male.

31:38.367 --> 31:40.598
You got a new uniform, I see.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.600
Yeah, gotta keep
Dr. Brumfield happy

31:42.601 --> 31:44.432
if I hope to work
up here someday.

31:44.433 --> 31:46.104
Yeah. What are you doing?

31:46.105 --> 31:47.976
Uh, we're done with Paul's body.

31:47.977 --> 31:49.477
It's... it's told us
everything it can,

31:49.478 --> 31:51.139
so I'm going to release it.

31:51.140 --> 31:53.411
Need any help?

31:53.412 --> 31:56.144
Well, I've got some...
Pretty technical work

31:56.145 --> 31:58.146
involving some highly
sophisticated equipment here.

31:58.147 --> 31:59.387
I don't know if
you can handle it.

31:59.388 --> 32:00.918
Wow. Yeah.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.091
I've read about one of
those in a medical journal.

32:03.092 --> 32:04.252
Really? You read?

32:04.253 --> 32:06.924
I'm no m.D., but maybe
I could give it a try.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.696
Okay.

32:08.697 --> 32:10.128
I don't know.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.929
It's really...

32:11.930 --> 32:13.402
(Mutters)

32:14.703 --> 32:18.266
There's a tray over
there that needs work.

32:18.267 --> 32:19.937
How does it work?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.069
(Laughs)

32:21.070 --> 32:23.111
No, I'm serious.
It's not working.

32:23.112 --> 32:24.642
Oh, um, well,
yeah, you gotta twist

32:24.643 --> 32:27.415
the little tiny thing
at the top... oh.

32:27.416 --> 32:29.317
Oh. (Blows air)
What did I just do?

32:29.318 --> 32:31.419
Whatdidyou do? Um...

32:31.420 --> 32:33.151
More importantly, why
are you doing it in here?

32:33.152 --> 32:35.123
Curtis, it's not her
fault. I asked her to help.

32:35.124 --> 32:37.186
Shoot.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.990
Give me that bottle.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.664
There's something on his hand.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.166
Ethan, go get a sectioning kit.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.737
Yeah.

32:49.738 --> 32:51.470
And you go get gone.

32:57.706 --> 33:00.178
I can't figure it out...

33:00.179 --> 33:03.182
Why I was the one who lived.

33:05.354 --> 33:06.684
Alex, you need
to walk us through

33:06.685 --> 33:08.186
what happened the other night.

33:08.187 --> 33:09.517
Paul was shot at the school,

33:09.518 --> 33:11.389
and then the killer came
here, looking for you.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.091
No, no. I wasn't
supposed to be here.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.063
I was out of town.

33:14.064 --> 33:15.563
I just ended up
coming back early.

33:15.564 --> 33:17.665
Maybe the killer was
looking for something else.

33:17.666 --> 33:19.127
What was Paul working on?

33:19.128 --> 33:21.329
Did he ever talk about
what he was doing?

33:21.330 --> 33:23.031
Uh, maybe. I don't know.

33:23.032 --> 33:24.502
I didn't pay much
attention. Sorry.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.773
What about a safe?

33:25.774 --> 33:27.775
This isn't the nicest
neighborhood.

33:27.776 --> 33:29.437
Where'd you keep your valuables?

33:29.438 --> 33:31.140
Paul had a place.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.641
Yeah.

33:33.642 --> 33:36.214
It's where he hid stuff to...
to keep it away from me.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.087
I wasn't supposed
to know about it.

33:39.288 --> 33:40.788
It's right...

33:40.789 --> 33:43.252
(Grunts) Thanks.

33:46.195 --> 33:47.225
(Rattles)

33:47.226 --> 33:48.456
(Grunts)

33:48.457 --> 33:49.527
(Clatters)

33:49.528 --> 33:51.400
(Alex grunts)

33:58.537 --> 34:00.308
What are those?

34:00.309 --> 34:03.271
Environmental survey
reports... Two sets...

34:03.272 --> 34:04.772
One from the school,

34:04.773 --> 34:08.117
and one from a... Building
site out in ardmore.

34:16.285 --> 34:18.326
The numbers are
exactly the same.

34:18.327 --> 34:20.158
There is no way you'd
get the exact same results

34:20.159 --> 34:21.490
from both sites.

34:25.334 --> 34:27.235
Right in here, Ethan.
Yes, that's what i'm...

34:27.236 --> 34:29.237
What are you two up to?

34:29.238 --> 34:31.239
Ethan happened to
make a little discovery

34:31.240 --> 34:32.740
while you were out.

34:32.741 --> 34:36.174
There was, uh, some kind
of substance on Paul's hand.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.475
It was invisible

34:37.476 --> 34:39.477
until it reacted to
some cleaning solution.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.479
We're trying to
isolate it right now,

34:41.480 --> 34:44.182
but here, smell this.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.184
It's somewhere in between

34:46.185 --> 34:47.815
paint thinner and gasoline.

34:47.816 --> 34:49.387
Has it been identified?

34:49.388 --> 34:51.659
It just came through
the g.C. Mass spec.

34:51.660 --> 34:54.262
Looks like a mixture
of hexane and acetone.

34:54.263 --> 34:55.523
Does that make sense?

34:55.524 --> 34:57.525
Hexane and acetone
are reagents used

34:57.526 --> 34:59.697
in the testing for
soil contaminants,

34:59.698 --> 35:01.229
like p.C.B.S and benzene.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.671
You can buy a test kit over
the Internet for 50 bucks.

35:03.672 --> 35:05.173
(Peter) So those reports...

35:05.174 --> 35:07.505
Paul was testing
the soil at the school.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.207
Well, it makes sense.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.508
He was a cancer survivor.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.240
He would be obsessed
with making sure

35:12.241 --> 35:14.142
that school was safe.

35:14.143 --> 35:15.813
(Kate) The councilwoman spent

35:15.814 --> 35:19.447
a lotof taxpayer dollars
to build this place.

35:19.448 --> 35:21.449
If this goes the way
I think it's gonna go,

35:21.450 --> 35:25.194
this is gonna mean
a huge political storm.

35:37.706 --> 35:41.710
I hope you have a big umbrella.

35:50.579 --> 35:52.750
You really put
yourself in a bind...

35:52.751 --> 35:54.652
Promising to build a new school

35:54.653 --> 35:56.454
within a year of being elected.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.755
That's a lot of pressure.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.457
Good reason to cut corners.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.459
You show me a political
office that doesn't come

36:01.460 --> 36:02.630
with pressure, detective.

36:02.631 --> 36:03.861
That is not a criminal offense.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.293
(Morris speaking
indistinctly) This is ridiculous.

36:05.294 --> 36:06.734
All she wanted to do
was help her district.

36:06.735 --> 36:08.466
That's all she ever wanted.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.698
(Sam) You know
what was on that land

36:10.699 --> 36:11.869
before you started
building, right?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.572
An electronics
manufacturing company

36:14.573 --> 36:17.245
that dumped all sorts of
who knows what into that soil.

36:17.246 --> 36:20.708
Our contractor... kavanagh...
Filed all the required surveys.

36:20.709 --> 36:22.910
How was it that you

36:22.911 --> 36:24.912
described Paul, Ms.
Bennett? (Rustles paper)

36:24.913 --> 36:27.956
"He was so bright. He
never missed a thing."

36:29.588 --> 36:32.390
Well, he didn't miss these.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.961
He figured out...

36:33.962 --> 36:38.296
That the environmental
report for the school...

36:38.297 --> 36:39.968
Was forged.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.873
You need to call
Mr. Kavanagh about this,

36:45.874 --> 36:47.235
not Ms. Bennett.

36:47.236 --> 36:48.506
He's the contractor.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.538
Mr. Kavanagh is being
brought in even as we speak.

36:50.539 --> 36:52.810
But Mr. Kavanagh did
not have the political clout

36:52.811 --> 36:54.682
to expedite these forms

36:54.683 --> 36:56.514
through the
public safety office.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.746
I believe that's the
councilwoman's signature

36:58.747 --> 37:00.488
on this form here.

37:00.489 --> 37:02.691
Still think we're talking
to the wrong person?

37:04.793 --> 37:06.654
(Councilwoman Bennett)
Detective, 50 documents...

37:06.655 --> 37:08.696
You're not the
only one she fooled.

37:08.697 --> 37:10.358
But what'd you tell me?

37:10.359 --> 37:12.730
Uh... "It's only politics"?

37:12.731 --> 37:13.861
(Morris) Your staff
didn't make the promise

37:13.862 --> 37:15.403
to build that school, you did.

37:15.404 --> 37:16.764
I'll tell you what I think.

37:16.765 --> 37:18.906
I think you knew the ground
at that site was contaminated,

37:18.907 --> 37:21.439
but to have it cleaned
up was either too costly

37:21.440 --> 37:22.670
or just plain impossible.

37:22.671 --> 37:24.672
But the wheels were
already in motion.

37:24.673 --> 37:25.973
You had to deliver.
(Sam) So you told...

37:25.974 --> 37:27.575
(clicks switch) Kate.

37:27.576 --> 37:30.378
What did you do?
I want to hear that.

37:30.379 --> 37:31.719
Do you remember what Alex said

37:31.720 --> 37:33.381
when we first found
him in the break room,

37:33.382 --> 37:34.782
just before he passed out?

37:34.783 --> 37:37.355
Some nonsense
about a carburetor.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.387
It's a funny thing about
our sense of smell,

37:39.388 --> 37:41.389
how closely it's tied
to our memories.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.561
Why would you think I give
a damn about that right now?

37:43.562 --> 37:45.563
Because I don't think what
Alex said was nonsense.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.695
I think it was tied directly
to the last memory he had

37:47.696 --> 37:49.367
before he was shot.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.299
So... he came home,
opened the door,

37:51.300 --> 37:52.940
and smelled carburetor?

37:52.941 --> 37:54.942
Actually, hexane and acetone,

37:54.943 --> 37:57.545
which are the same
chemicals that Paul was using

37:57.546 --> 37:59.507
the night he was killed.

37:59.508 --> 38:01.349
And somehow, they must
have spilled on his killer.

38:01.350 --> 38:03.351
I remember smelling
something the first time

38:03.352 --> 38:04.812
we went to Bennett's
office. It was like a nail salon.

38:04.813 --> 38:06.485
I smell it right now.

38:08.457 --> 38:10.017
What do you bet,

38:10.018 --> 38:11.959
I swab your coat,

38:11.960 --> 38:13.821
and we find...

38:13.822 --> 38:17.295
(Sniffs) Hmm,
hexane and acetone?

38:19.328 --> 38:20.668
Mm.

38:20.669 --> 38:22.701
I think we'll hold on to this.

38:37.646 --> 38:40.317
(Megan) So when they
ask him whose idea it was

38:40.318 --> 38:41.819
to fake the reports,

38:41.820 --> 38:43.822
who's he gonna name, Emily?

38:44.993 --> 38:46.694
I want to make a deal.

38:46.695 --> 38:48.496
Tell them I want
to make a deal now.

38:48.497 --> 38:50.958
Yeah? What do you have to offer?

38:50.959 --> 38:52.800
Kavanagh. He's the one
who pulled the trigger.

38:52.801 --> 38:54.732
He shot Paul and Alex.

38:54.733 --> 38:55.933
But you put him up to it.

38:55.934 --> 38:56.934
No.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.837
I only did what had to be done.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.469
By the time he uncovered
the contamination,

39:01.470 --> 39:03.711
it was $50 million too late.

39:03.712 --> 39:05.573
We would've been run out of town

39:05.574 --> 39:07.575
for wasting that kind of money.

39:07.576 --> 39:10.648
Her political career was
staked on that school.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.420
Mycareer was staked

39:12.421 --> 39:14.423
on that school.

39:17.426 --> 39:18.786
(Handcuffs clicking)
Emily Burrows,

39:18.787 --> 39:19.957
you're under arrest for the
murder of Paul Crawford.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.989
Now let's go.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.531
(Indistinct conversations)

39:23.532 --> 39:25.763
I did it for all of
us. You know that.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.364
We could've taken
the mayor's office,

39:27.365 --> 39:28.696
the governor's.

39:28.697 --> 39:30.798
I believed in you that much.

39:30.799 --> 39:33.802
I believed in you!

39:36.845 --> 39:39.548
Sure you want to do this?

39:40.709 --> 39:41.880
Yeah.

39:58.927 --> 40:01.470
(Alex) Mm.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.574
(Exhales deeply)

40:06.575 --> 40:09.537
Donating bone
marrow to Paul, it...

40:09.538 --> 40:11.679
It was probably...

40:11.680 --> 40:14.582
The one good
thing that I ever did.

40:14.583 --> 40:17.414
It was something that made
me feel good about myself.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.916
Well, Paul...

40:18.917 --> 40:21.018
Probably saved hundreds,

40:21.019 --> 40:22.890
if not thousands of kids,

40:22.891 --> 40:26.594
who would've gotten sick
if that school had opened.

40:26.595 --> 40:30.558
And if you hadn't
saved Paul's life,

40:30.559 --> 40:32.830
it never would've happened.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.702
I'd say that's a lot of reasons

40:34.703 --> 40:36.003
to feel good about yourself.

40:36.004 --> 40:37.835
(Cries)

40:37.836 --> 40:39.537
(Sobs)

40:39.538 --> 40:40.739
(Sniffles)

40:42.911 --> 40:44.712
I think I was given
a second chance

40:44.713 --> 40:46.073
when I woke up in here,

40:46.074 --> 40:48.646
and I'm gonna do
something with it.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.879
