06:23.500 --> 06:24.717
Mother!

06:24.881 --> 06:25.962
Gotcha!

06:26.722 --> 06:28.132
All right,

06:28.219 --> 06:30.055
... you're asking for it!
- One more step and...

06:30.519 --> 06:32.657
... you're gonna get it!

06:39.419 --> 06:40.492
Parental abuse!

06:47.206 --> 06:49.852
- I'll quit if you quit.
- Truce?

06:50.869 --> 06:52.104
Truce.

06:54.284 --> 06:55.989
Help your old mother up.

07:01.399 --> 07:03.133
I had my fingers crossed!

07:03.778 --> 07:06.491
You're gonna be very sorry...
Don't do that!

07:07.037 --> 07:08.161
Not as sorry as you!

07:09.166 --> 07:10.177
Jerry's home!

07:10.195 --> 07:11.668
Come on.

07:12.524 --> 07:13.625
Come on, honey...

07:14.901 --> 07:16.627
"Jerry's home"

07:17.030 --> 07:18.342
Yeah!

07:26.466 --> 07:27.382
Excuse me, lady,

07:27.403 --> 07:29.313
is this the Blake residence?
- It is.

07:41.963 --> 07:43.473
Stephanie home?

07:43.652 --> 07:45.280
She's in the backyard.

07:48.121 --> 07:50.608
- I've got a surprise for her.
- What?

07:51.170 --> 07:53.465
- Something no family should
be without. - What is it?

07:56.290 --> 07:57.283
Stephanie!

07:57.864 --> 07:59.050
There's somebody I'd like you
to meet.

08:05.996 --> 08:09.287
I can't tell you what his name is,
because he doesn't have one yet.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.223
Names don't seem to matter much.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.549
I had a dog when I was a kid.

08:14.396 --> 08:17.110
He was just a mutt, but to
me, he was Rin Tin Tin.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.412
Rin Tin Tin?

08:18.577 --> 08:20.356
Well, that was a little before
your time, I guess.

08:21.050 --> 08:23.653
So, what do you think? Can we
give this little guy a home?

08:23.813 --> 08:26.305
- Sure.
- That's my girl...

08:28.435 --> 08:31.152
I'll go inside and call Karen
to tell her about the puppy.

08:31.908 --> 08:35.157
- Honey... What do you say?
- Thanks, Jerry!

08:42.801 --> 08:44.727
I gotta fix that screendoor
one of these days...

08:47.116 --> 08:49.638
I hope she doesn't think I was
trying to buy her love.

08:49.802 --> 08:52.675
- Maybe the puppy was a mistake.
- The puppy was perfect.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.379
You're perfect!

08:56.302 --> 08:58.658
Give her some time.
It'll be fine.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.049
I know... All takes time!

09:02.518 --> 09:04.719
And time is one thing I got
plenty of.

09:12.413 --> 09:14.206
I feel like I'm watching a
tennis match.

09:14.503 --> 09:15.959
Stephanie, why don't you ease in
for a landing?

09:16.633 --> 09:18.566
I'll stop pacing if you stop
doodling.

09:18.992 --> 09:23.401
All right, you pace, I'll doodle,
and we'll both be happy.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.314
We were... talking about your
father.

09:26.645 --> 09:28.612
My father died a year ago.

09:28.966 --> 09:30.803
Sorry, I meant your stepfather.

09:31.498 --> 09:33.215
If my father hadn't died,

09:33.472 --> 09:34.920
there wouldn't be a stepfather.

09:35.181 --> 09:37.316
You're mad at him for dying.

09:37.784 --> 09:39.702
I'm mad at somebody!

09:39.820 --> 09:41.044
Being unable to accept your
father's death...

09:41.393 --> 09:44.801
... is part of the reason you've
been getting into trouble.

09:44.961 --> 09:47.030
I'm not in that much trouble.

09:49.487 --> 09:52.127
Suspended three times last year...

09:52.288 --> 09:55.429
Twice this year, and school's
barely been in session two months.

09:55.816 --> 09:57.171
I know what my problem is.

10:00.036 --> 10:01.253
Him.

10:02.491 --> 10:03.560
If he wasn't here,

10:06.308 --> 10:08.218
my Mom and I would be alright.

10:08.668 --> 10:09.680
Steph,

10:10.221 --> 10:11.638
you're going to have to
face the fact...

10:11.794 --> 10:13.783
... that your mother loves
the guy.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.853
She doesn't see!

10:16.147 --> 10:18.371
Doesn't see what, Stephanie?

10:21.901 --> 10:23.656
I think my time is up.

10:25.584 --> 10:26.652
Isn't it?

10:32.641 --> 10:34.364
So, how was your session?

10:35.172 --> 10:36.243
OK.

10:40.428 --> 10:43.340
Sweetheart, it seems like you
and I are always budding heads.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.369
How about we try to get along
a little better?

10:47.947 --> 10:48.939
Sure.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.161
One more thing and then I'll
shut up.

10:51.571 --> 10:54.099
It's very important to your
mother and to me...

10:54.507 --> 10:56.664
... that you try to get along
better in school this year.

10:59.685 --> 11:01.908
What do you say?

11:08.699 --> 11:10.073
Stephanie, knock it off!

11:13.379 --> 11:14.905
Girls, come on, stop it!

11:17.982 --> 11:19.126
Enough!

11:20.591 --> 11:24.038
It's the last time you cause
an outburst in my classroom.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.478
Mr. Conroy! Stephie didn't
start it!

11:25.670 --> 11:27.204
When I want your opinion, Baker,
I'll ask for it.

11:27.263 --> 11:31.903
You couldn't have got yourself
in deeper trouble if you tried.

11:45.351 --> 11:46.879
Well, Norah, what do you think?

11:47.116 --> 11:48.686
- I love it!
- I knew you would.

11:48.996 --> 11:50.905
And this is the south. You'll
have sun all day long.

11:51.412 --> 11:53.211
- What do you think, pumpkin?
- I don't know...

11:53.521 --> 11:55.627
Oh! One thing I forgot to
mention.

11:56.207 --> 11:57.778
It comes with a swing set.

12:04.108 --> 12:05.407
I have a daughter, too.

12:05.988 --> 12:08.355
She's a few years older than you.
Her name is Stephanie.

12:09.056 --> 12:10.856
She goes to Oakridge High,

12:11.050 --> 12:13.037
which is where you'll be going
one of these days...

12:13.967 --> 12:15.571
... after your parents buy
the house.

12:17.113 --> 12:19.097
- What grade are you in, Cindy?
- Third.

12:19.413 --> 12:20.591
Third grade... !

12:21.715 --> 12:23.745
I remember when Jill was in
third grade.

12:24.707 --> 12:26.831
I used to walk her home from
school every day.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.261
- Who's Jill?
- That's my daughter.

12:29.655 --> 12:31.055
You said her name was Stephanie.

12:32.322 --> 12:33.619
Right, Stephanie.

12:34.413 --> 12:35.448
She goes to Oakridge High.

12:37.231 --> 12:38.859
She's on the student council.

12:39.264 --> 12:41.086
She's a straight A's student.

12:41.490 --> 12:43.060
I'm very proud of her.

12:48.797 --> 12:50.750
- Suspended again?
- Expelled.

12:50.906 --> 12:53.394
No! What're you gonna do?

12:53.936 --> 12:55.507
Maybe boarding school.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.228
- Really?
- I'm sure gonna try for it.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.905
What's your stepfather gonna
do when he finds out?

13:02.490 --> 13:03.942
He's gonna kill me.

13:05.962 --> 13:08.031
Expelled? You're kidding.

13:08.819 --> 13:10.925
Principal said it wasn't
working out.

13:11.351 --> 13:12.616
I'm sorry, Mom.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.418
Girls don't get expelled.

13:14.803 --> 13:17.444
All right, it's over...
The damage is done...

13:17.604 --> 13:18.675
Now...

13:19.331 --> 13:21.283
What are we gonna do about
the future?

13:23.128 --> 13:24.928
I wanna go to a boarding
school.

13:26.313 --> 13:27.533
You wanna leave home?

13:28.652 --> 13:30.713
It's not a family without
children.

13:31.067 --> 13:32.366
I think it'd be best for
everybody.

13:32.525 --> 13:34.402
Best for everybody?

13:34.712 --> 13:36.774
Running away would be best for
everybody?

13:36.938 --> 13:38.311
It's not running away!

13:41.693 --> 13:42.643
Well,

13:43.305 --> 13:44.483
Jerry, what do you think?

13:46.719 --> 13:49.478
I don't think we have to break up
the family, do we, pumpkin?

13:54.678 --> 13:56.167
Father knows best.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.868
Karen, it's freaky, the way he
looks at me...

14:19.937 --> 14:22.543
... like he wanted to erase me
off the face of the earth.

14:23.044 --> 14:24.037
I'm sure.

14:24.694 --> 14:26.221
Ok, don't believe me.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.068
Ok, so, what's the verdict?

14:28.799 --> 14:31.228
Is Scary Jerry gonna let you
go to a boarding school?

14:31.388 --> 14:36.277
I don't know. He has his own fantasy
we should be like families on TV.

14:36.528 --> 14:39.171
Grin and laugh, and have fewer
cavities all the time...

14:39.328 --> 14:42.756
It's like having Ward Cleaver
for a Dad.

14:43.489 --> 14:47.132
I gotta hang. Firing squad has
arrived. Bye.

14:48.208 --> 14:49.702
Come in.

14:52.004 --> 14:53.111
So, where's my blindfold?

14:53.137 --> 14:54.432
What blindfold?

14:54.883 --> 14:57.734
I thought the condemned person
always got a blindfold.

15:10.878 --> 15:12.831
You don't really wanna leave
home... do you, honey?

15:15.328 --> 15:16.321
Yes, I do.

15:19.509 --> 15:21.691
It isn't our house anymore...

15:22.348 --> 15:23.493
... it's his!

15:23.652 --> 15:25.583
Of course it's our house.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.443
It's always been our house.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.354
I loved your father,

15:32.570 --> 15:35.153
and when he died I thought:

15:37.499 --> 15:39.454
"Well, maybe that's it.

15:41.852 --> 15:44.421
Maybe you only get one chance
to be happy. "

15:46.323 --> 15:49.002
I never thought I'd love anybody
that much again.

15:49.966 --> 15:51.356
I know, Mom.

15:52.959 --> 15:53.890
I miss him so bad...

15:55.069 --> 15:57.037
I know you do, honey.

16:01.435 --> 16:03.999
We have a second chance with
Jerry.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.911
He's a wonderful man.
And he wants to care for us.

16:11.868 --> 16:13.439
Can't you just...

16:15.820 --> 16:17.468
... give him a chance?

16:18.428 --> 16:19.883
I'm trying.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.607
I'm really trying hard!

16:23.664 --> 16:25.312
There's just something
about him.

16:25.563 --> 16:28.758
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know! I just...

16:31.317 --> 16:32.291
I hope you're not still upset...

16:32.449 --> 16:35.096
... over this school business.

16:35.402 --> 16:37.301
We were just talking about that.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.329
Everything will look clearer
in the morning, uh?

16:41.443 --> 16:42.930
We'll work it out.

16:45.356 --> 16:46.653
Good night, sweetheart.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.591
Good night, Mom.

16:51.034 --> 16:52.586
Sweet dreams, Steph.

16:54.831 --> 16:56.380
G' night, Jerry.

17:00.431 --> 17:02.938
<i>Wilbur, will you turn the page
for me?</i>

17:03.365 --> 17:05.371
<i>Turn it yourself. You've
got a tongue.</i>

17:05.457 --> 17:06.755
<i>No, I'd better not.</i>

17:06.913 --> 17:10.377
<i>I tried it yesterday and swallow
the comic section.</i>

17:14.221 --> 17:17.800
<i>OK, I'll be quiet as a
church mouse.</i>

17:31.195 --> 17:33.799
I used to love this show
when I was a kid.

17:34.072 --> 17:36.693
It wasn't till I got in high school
I realized horses couldn't talk.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.915
- I bet you were cute back then.
- Yeah...

17:39.174 --> 17:41.122
I'd like to see a picture of you.

17:41.764 --> 17:43.325
You would, wouldn't you?

17:43.700 --> 17:45.456
You never talk about your past.

17:47.077 --> 17:49.061
I didn't even exist until
I met you.

17:49.378 --> 17:51.558
Past is important.

17:57.586 --> 17:59.113
Don't try to touch the past.

18:00.501 --> 18:01.862
It isn't real.

18:02.112 --> 18:03.377
It's just a dream.

18:05.563 --> 18:07.289
The only reality is...

18:07.522 --> 18:08.897
... this moment.

18:10.015 --> 18:11.639
You and me.

18:12.471 --> 18:14.606
Here and now.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.697
What are we doing here?

19:41.376 --> 19:44.486
This is the house where Henry
Morrison murdered his family.

19:45.386 --> 19:47.007
Do you think I don't remember
that?

19:49.107 --> 19:50.603
I was here that night.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.608
I never wanna see anything
like that again.

19:54.714 --> 19:56.903
Yeah, I know. A friend of mine
sent me your article.

19:57.586 --> 20:01.340
I was in Europe at that time.
It took 9 months for me to get it.

20:05.060 --> 20:06.994
Cops did never really catch
the guy.

20:07.563 --> 20:09.813
File's inactive. I think it
should be reopened.

20:10.213 --> 20:12.341
Yeah, well... Talk to the cops.
I'm just a reporter.

20:12.510 --> 20:14.540
Well, I talked to the cops.
They can give a shit.

20:16.247 --> 20:17.724
Listen to me a minute, alright?

20:18.078 --> 20:20.269
Three weeks before Morrison
killed them...

20:20.719 --> 20:22.591
... he quit his job, didn't
tell anybody.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.556
Got up every morning, pretending
he'd go to work,

20:24.576 --> 20:26.474
and came home at the
same time every night.

20:27.065 --> 20:28.117
So how far could he go every day...

20:28.282 --> 20:31.819
... and still get back at the same
time every night? Look at this.

20:32.211 --> 20:33.551
It has to be...

20:35.258 --> 20:37.272
... somewhere within this radius.

20:38.465 --> 20:39.567
See, what I think...

20:40.636 --> 20:43.173
... is that during that time he was
setting himself up a new life,

20:43.270 --> 20:44.801
somewhere close by.

20:45.943 --> 20:47.991
- What do you want from me?
- Just this:

20:48.358 --> 20:49.854
do a follow up story, right?

20:50.020 --> 20:52.630
You run a picture of Morrison.
Your paper circulates in this area.

20:52.829 --> 20:56.420
Someone might recognize him and if
they do, Brennan, you're a hero.

20:58.606 --> 20:59.710
Why are you chasing this?

21:05.137 --> 21:07.263
Vicky Morrison's maden name
was Ogilvie.

21:10.914 --> 21:12.409
She was my sister.

21:13.882 --> 21:15.143
Oh... Jesus!

21:18.552 --> 21:20.363
I'm sorry, Ogilvie, uh?

21:21.442 --> 21:23.254
Ok, I'll do what I can, right?

21:26.658 --> 21:27.603
OK.

21:31.922 --> 21:33.306
This place is mine now.

21:34.996 --> 21:36.178
You wanna go inside?

21:36.850 --> 21:38.031
Fuck no!

21:49.662 --> 21:50.967
I'll take him.

21:51.363 --> 21:54.840
Everybody! Everybody!
Jerry is gonna make a speech!

21:59.656 --> 22:01.906
I guess you all know why I
asked you here.

22:02.076 --> 22:04.021
'Cause when I first started with
American Eagle Realty, a year ago,

22:04.471 --> 22:06.584
you were the first five families
I sold houses to.

22:07.041 --> 22:09.516
Yeah, Jerry, I've been meaning to
ask you about my garage door.

22:09.685 --> 22:11.812
It would still work if you wouldn't
have gotten your car into it.

22:13.710 --> 22:15.883
We met doing business and we
stayed to become friends.

22:16.616 --> 22:18.278
And although I may be arguing
against the comission here,

22:18.345 --> 22:21.508
don't sell your houses 'cause
I like being your neighbor.

22:22.981 --> 22:25.486
I wanna get a picture with my
family. Steph! Susan!

22:25.650 --> 22:27.949
Come here! Come on down.

22:28.302 --> 22:29.597
Yeah! Come here.

22:31.220 --> 22:32.322
Yeah, come on!

22:33.628 --> 22:35.395
- Come on, Steph.
- Oh, I don't know...

22:36.201 --> 22:38.011
There we are... OK.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.483
This is as good as it gets!

22:45.616 --> 22:47.429
I hope you don't think what
I'm gonna say is pretencious.

22:47.501 --> 22:49.170
I sell houses, that's my job,

22:49.309 --> 22:52.027
but sometimes I think it's more
than that... I truly believe

22:53.221 --> 22:55.856
... that what I sell is the
American Dream.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.403
You can call me sentimental,
I don't care.

23:00.073 --> 23:01.806
When I came here I was
a stranger,

23:02.803 --> 23:05.211
but I never felt more at home
anywhere in my life.

23:05.597 --> 23:09.639
I have beautiful friends,
I have a wonderful new family...

23:14.075 --> 23:16.340
Have a good time. Thanks
for coming.

23:32.504 --> 23:35.274
Look at this. They'd print
anything to make a buck.

23:35.930 --> 23:39.820
- It's just simple sensation.
- What's that, Herb?

23:40.175 --> 23:42.303
That guy in Bellvue who killed
his whole family.

23:42.472 --> 23:44.673
Cut'em up with knives.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.124
I don't think I know about that.

23:47.616 --> 23:50.638
It happened last year, that's
what I was talking about.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.351
This thing is a year old and they
go waking it up again.

23:55.516 --> 23:56.777
This is terrible.

23:58.443 --> 23:59.501
Jerry...

24:00.299 --> 24:01.401
Jerry?

24:01.987 --> 24:03.824
You're alright?

24:05.588 --> 24:08.307
This kind of thing really gets
to me, you know?

24:08.674 --> 24:12.029
That a man could be driven to do
something like that to his family?

24:12.316 --> 24:13.689
to his children?

24:16.273 --> 24:18.164
I don't even wanna know
about it.

24:18.270 --> 24:22.015
Makes you wonder though...
What's it take to make a guy...

24:22.187 --> 24:23.525
... do such a thing?

24:24.311 --> 24:26.299
Maybe they disappointed him.

24:33.788 --> 24:36.219
Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be a party.

24:37.474 --> 24:39.409
Hey, Tommy! Tommy, come here!

24:43.109 --> 24:45.781
- You're Black Beard, the Pirate.
- Thank you, Mr. Blake.

24:46.038 --> 24:47.176
Aye aye, Captain.

24:50.934 --> 24:54.511
Steph, honey, would you go down
and get the ice cream, please?

25:23.881 --> 25:25.928
All we need is a little order
around here!

25:26.374 --> 25:27.431
Order!!

25:28.432 --> 25:30.402
You're a good boy. You're
Daddy's little angels.

25:33.419 --> 25:35.860
Why don't they just leave
me alone?!

25:37.216 --> 25:38.759
Let me out! Let me out!

25:40.146 --> 25:41.879
We're gonna keep this family
together.

25:43.746 --> 25:45.661
You had better believe it!!

25:54.216 --> 25:55.351
Hi, honey.

25:59.677 --> 26:00.892
Oh, the ice cream.

26:03.158 --> 26:04.262
Honey,

26:04.884 --> 26:06.240
you know how it is.

26:07.141 --> 26:11.343
Being a salesman, smiling all
the time, you know-Sometimes I,

26:12.460 --> 26:14.947
have to let off some steam,
you know?

26:18.621 --> 26:19.881
You know how it is.

26:20.944 --> 26:24.368
Sure. I gotta get back or Mom
is gonna wonder where I'm at.

27:20.469 --> 27:21.605
Steph,

27:23.554 --> 27:25.209
things like these don't happen.

27:25.495 --> 27:26.675
It happened to them.

27:28.067 --> 27:29.484
Let me see if I follow your
thinking.

27:30.361 --> 27:33.401
A man murdered his family.
You hate Jerry.

27:34.201 --> 27:37.474
Therefore, Jerry is the man
who murdered his family.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.259
Yeah... that all adds up.

27:39.938 --> 27:42.425
Karen, maybe Jerry isn't the guy...

27:42.789 --> 27:45.669
but you don't know him like I do,
or see him down in the basement.

27:46.508 --> 27:49.435
And guess when Jerry showed up
in town and met my Mom?

27:49.594 --> 27:51.091
Right after this!

27:51.496 --> 27:54.162
So, what are you going to do,
Nancy Drew?

27:54.305 --> 27:56.274
I'm writing this letter to
the "Seattle Examiner",

27:56.441 --> 27:58.691
and ask them to send me a picture
of Henry Morrison.

27:59.329 --> 28:02.133
I told them I'm in a project
about mass murders.

28:04.039 --> 28:05.807
Off the deep end...

28:06.296 --> 28:07.509
Give me a break.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.842
You didn't run his fucking
picture!

28:19.003 --> 28:22.593
- How is anyone gonna identify him?
- Get your hands off of me!

28:22.761 --> 28:25.168
My editor didn't want the picture
not me, huh!

28:25.651 --> 28:27.822
I almost didn't get the article
on the paper at all!

28:28.501 --> 28:31.580
What do you want from me? I just
work here, I don't make policy.

28:33.605 --> 28:34.663
I'm sorry.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.245
Yeah, I don't want this to happen
again. Almost gave me a coronary.

28:38.434 --> 28:39.537
Here.

28:43.638 --> 28:46.047
And this is a job for
professionals, Ogilvie.

28:46.607 --> 28:47.912
You're just one man.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.150
Why don't you get on with the rest
of your life? Forget about it!

28:55.233 --> 28:56.809
You saw what he did to 'em.

28:58.235 --> 28:59.827
Can you forget about it?

29:11.237 --> 29:14.524
Mom says you only charge half
of your regular fees to see me.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.380
How come you do that?

29:18.134 --> 29:20.983
My 3 o'clock pacient is
schizophrenic. I charge him double.

29:21.222 --> 29:22.562
All works out.

29:23.359 --> 29:24.979
Besides, I like seeing you.

29:26.209 --> 29:27.547
You were gonna tell me your idea.

29:29.296 --> 29:32.649
I wanna go to a boarding school.
Don't say it's running away.

29:32.817 --> 29:34.517
- What's the matter with running
away? - It's just that...

29:36.971 --> 29:39.414
- What?
- Sometimes running away is the best.

29:39.941 --> 29:42.190
It gives everybody some breathing
room, right?

29:43.065 --> 29:44.123
Right.

29:44.294 --> 29:45.553
What do your folks say?

29:46.747 --> 29:48.481
I think I can talk my Mom into it.

29:48.805 --> 29:50.973
<i>And what about... him?</i>

29:51.891 --> 29:54.615
He has this crazy thing about
breaking up the family.

29:55.414 --> 29:58.137
If you saw this man, you would
say: "Commit him".

29:59.569 --> 30:01.031
You probably are driving
him crazy

30:01.190 --> 30:03.048
to a certain extent.
- Yeah...

30:03.644 --> 30:05.028
Why don't I have a talk with him?

30:06.414 --> 30:08.260
If you could be on my side...

30:08.845 --> 30:10.797
<i>I am on your side.</i>

30:11.322 --> 30:12.425
I'll give your father...

30:13.421 --> 30:14.399
Sorry.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.018
<i>I'll give... him a call.</i>

31:17.210 --> 31:18.830
You're home awfully early.

31:20.032 --> 31:22.283
Hi, honey, I run out of
appointments.

31:23.197 --> 31:24.581
Anything for me?

31:25.216 --> 31:26.993
As a matter of fact, something
did come for you.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.799
Well, can I have it?

31:30.467 --> 31:31.620
I don't know...

31:32.444 --> 31:33.259
What do you mean?

31:33.406 --> 31:36.496
I don't know if it's the kind of
thing you should be looking at.

31:41.145 --> 31:43.290
I'm just kidding. Here you go.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.566
Ohh... My sweet little thing.

32:15.088 --> 32:16.584
My sweet little bitch.

32:17.067 --> 32:19.633
That's my good girl.

32:20.429 --> 32:22.208
Yes, you are daddy...

32:57.860 --> 32:58.781
Jerry, honey!

33:00.889 --> 33:01.869
Yes?

33:01.940 --> 33:03.247
Dinner in 15 minutes.

33:19.881 --> 33:20.904
Okay...

33:22.888 --> 33:24.147
Where did you go?

33:27.954 --> 33:29.730
Oh, yeah...

33:31.317 --> 33:33.567
Ahhh... That's my baby.

33:34.798 --> 33:36.014
I'm sorry.

33:37.490 --> 33:38.627
Hello?

33:38.954 --> 33:40.135
Hi, Dr. Bondurant.

33:43.308 --> 33:44.285
Jerry?

33:44.731 --> 33:46.781
Dr. Bondurant is on the phone
for you.

33:48.768 --> 33:50.073
What does he want?

33:50.471 --> 33:52.247
He wants you to come in for
a talk.

33:54.072 --> 33:55.535
Tell him I'm not here.

33:55.773 --> 33:57.743
<i>- Why don't you just come up and
talk to him? - Tell him...</i>

33:57.910 --> 33:58.933
I'm not here!

33:59.691 --> 34:02.177
<i>And if he calls back, tell him
I'm still not here.</i>

34:05.033 --> 34:07.047
<i>Er... Jerry can't come to the
phone right now. - I see</i>

34:08.714 --> 34:10.603
Could I have him call you back?

34:10.772 --> 34:12.978
<i>- Yes, that would be fine.
- Thank you.</i>

34:41.574 --> 34:44.456
I take it you're the guy
that called me... Ogilvie?

34:45.328 --> 34:46.869
I'm Lieutenant Wall.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.679
You're in my parking space.

34:48.942 --> 34:52.166
I figured this way you'd have to
talk to me about Henry Morrison.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.433
For starters, Morrison isn't his
real name.

34:59.338 --> 35:01.547
- Well, what is it?
- God only knows, we don't.

35:01.617 --> 35:04.872
His personal history was falsified
and his prints were untraceable.

35:05.557 --> 35:07.809
We talked to a criminal
psychologist

35:08.390 --> 35:10.219
who proposed a possibility

35:10.290 --> 35:11.915
you might be interested in.

35:12.515 --> 35:14.925
He said it was possible that
Morrison had done it before.

35:15.405 --> 35:19.151
Married into an existing family,
something upsets him and wipes 'em out.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.662
You knew him,

35:20.826 --> 35:22.007
What do you think?

35:22.687 --> 35:25.219
I think it's better than a
possibility.

35:25.377 --> 35:26.794
What do you plan to do about it?

35:27.870 --> 35:29.130
For the moment, nothing.

35:29.296 --> 35:30.948
We don't have a single lead.

35:31.194 --> 35:32.579
The guy is smart!

35:33.372 --> 35:36.298
We won't have anything to go on
unless he does it again.

35:36.457 --> 35:38.584
You're gonna wait until he gets to
another family and butchers them?

35:38.752 --> 35:41.195
You're not hearing me!
We've got nothing!

35:41.523 --> 35:42.828
Zilch!

35:43.859 --> 35:45.163
Lieutenant,

35:45.956 --> 35:48.005
if you were me, what would you do?

35:48.884 --> 35:50.697
Just between the two of us?

35:52.327 --> 35:55.175
I'd get a gun and blow the son
of a bitch away.

36:14.367 --> 36:15.707
How do you do, Mrs. Leitner?

36:15.872 --> 36:17.728
- I'm Jerry Blake.
- How do you do? Please sit down.

36:17.890 --> 36:21.008
I've come to talk about the
situation with Stephanie.

36:21.175 --> 36:23.301
I'm afraid, Mr. Blake,
it's a lost cause.

36:23.707 --> 36:27.130
Well... I'm sort of a believer
in lost causes.

36:28.309 --> 36:29.298
OK.

36:29.852 --> 36:31.427
I guess I have to face it.

36:31.752 --> 36:34.758
Jerry Blake is the most wonderful
man in the world.

36:35.077 --> 36:36.967
He got you back into school,
didn't he?

36:37.332 --> 36:39.819
You know why, don't you?
To get out of seeing you.

36:40.497 --> 36:41.978
Did it ever ocurred
to you that maybe...

36:42.041 --> 36:44.308
it isn't the rest of
the world that's wrong?

36:45.438 --> 36:48.128
I told you how phony he is, and
how he acted in the basement

36:48.192 --> 36:51.056
... making faces at himself.
- Oh, come on! We all do that.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.968
Why did he freak out and...

36:54.225 --> 36:56.508
absolutely refused
to come and see you?

36:57.310 --> 36:59.087
Because he's afraid
of my eagle eye?

37:00.516 --> 37:01.821
It's more than that.

37:06.666 --> 37:08.713
He scares me, Dr. Bondurant.

37:10.782 --> 37:12.182
I'm afraid of him!

37:25.837 --> 37:27.223
Jerry Blake here.

37:28.885 --> 37:30.617
Which house was that?

37:32.090 --> 37:34.656
Yes, sir, I'd be happy
to show you that house, Mr...

37:35.702 --> 37:36.805
Martin?

37:37.009 --> 37:39.258
<i>What about 4:30 tomorrow?</i>

37:39.540 --> 37:41.318
Fine! I'll see you then.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.139
So, are you gonna be
coming back to art class?

37:58.377 --> 38:00.627
No. They put me
in typing instead.

38:01.028 --> 38:04.033
What a waste! You've got
a lot of artistic talent.

38:04.392 --> 38:06.327
- Get out of here!
- No, really, I mean it.

38:06.490 --> 38:08.741
You'd have a great future
as a big shirt designer.

38:09.418 --> 38:11.467
I really liked the one
you made for Mr. Conroy.

38:12.386 --> 38:14.401
The green hand print was great!

38:15.869 --> 38:19.222
If I buy my own paints, would you
make one like that for me too?

38:19.469 --> 38:21.440
No, but I might
do it to your face.

38:21.648 --> 38:24.888
All right... Give it to me,
give me that shot. Come on!

38:25.168 --> 38:26.665
Maine she takes a jab!

38:28.414 --> 38:30.349
Baker shots her jaws!

38:31.392 --> 38:34.432
Maine pounds at his
middle section!

38:34.789 --> 38:36.253
Baker gets her to the corner!

38:46.323 --> 38:48.476
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
- Sure, great.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.554
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

39:49.273 --> 39:52.390
- Hi, sorry I'm a little late.
- No problem, no problem.

39:52.715 --> 39:54.921
- Ray Martin.
- Hi, Ray. Jerry Blake.

39:55.406 --> 39:58.524
- It's a great house.
- Wait till you see inside. Come.

40:02.213 --> 40:04.936
- Come on in.
- Big mirror in the hall.

40:05.814 --> 40:07.278
And lot of closets in here.

40:07.794 --> 40:09.807
It's great. Kitchen back here?

40:10.365 --> 40:11.704
Yes, it's back here, yeah.

40:12.259 --> 40:14.667
I forgot to tell you,
lovely hardwood floors.

40:15.085 --> 40:17.020
Look at the inlaid.
It's terrific.

40:17.278 --> 40:20.238
- Right, very nice.
- I'll show you the bedroom.

40:22.162 --> 40:23.422
Lot of space here.

40:23.666 --> 40:26.672
Lot of room for kids.
You a family man, Ray?

40:26.736 --> 40:29.163
Confirmed bachelor.
How about you, Jerry?

40:29.603 --> 40:31.730
Happily married. I wouldn't
trade it for the world.

40:32.691 --> 40:35.352
I don't know... I think
it just works for some guys.

40:35.675 --> 40:36.778
What's that?

40:37.100 --> 40:41.130
<i>You know, the family, home
sweet home, all that crap.</i>

40:52.730 --> 40:55.191
What line of work are you in, Ray?
If you don't mind my asking.

40:55.742 --> 40:58.387
Oh! Not at all!
I'm in stress management.

40:58.451 --> 41:02.077
Sounds complicated.
The kitchen has been remodeled.

41:02.680 --> 41:04.098
Built-ins. I like this.

41:04.659 --> 41:08.925
I try to find ways for employers
and employees to get along better.

41:09.463 --> 41:11.906
I ask questions,
they give me answers.

41:12.765 --> 41:14.734
<i>For instance: How do you sleep
at night?</i>

41:15.953 --> 41:17.654
How do you sleep at night, Jerry?

41:18.537 --> 41:20.975
- I sleep like a baby.
- See, that's interesting.

41:21.885 --> 41:24.575
Because I think there'd be a lot
of stress in your line of work.

41:25.606 --> 41:29.274
I suppose there's a certain degree
of stress in every job, Ray.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.984
It depends on how you handle it.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.332
Which way am I facing?

41:35.107 --> 41:36.018
North.

41:39.465 --> 41:43.212
Come on in here, Ray. Great big
room for kids to tumble around in.

41:44.361 --> 41:46.701
You know, a house like this should
really have a family in it.

41:47.249 --> 41:49.342
You mean you won't sell it to me
because I don't have one?

41:49.907 --> 41:53.148
Oh, no! I didn't say that.
This is all being remodeled here.

41:53.707 --> 41:56.300
You really are a fan of traditional
values, aren't you, Jerry?

41:56.555 --> 41:58.097
Tradition is important.

41:59.408 --> 42:01.301
Sounds like you had
a strict up-bringing?

42:03.164 --> 42:04.469
You might say that.

42:06.079 --> 42:08.383
- Let me ask you a question, Ray.
- Sure.

42:10.151 --> 42:12.482
Are you interested in
buying a house or in me?

42:13.781 --> 42:14.839
Sorry.

42:15.047 --> 42:16.167
Force of habit.

42:16.303 --> 42:18.272
My wife gets on me
for that all the time.

42:22.357 --> 42:24.502
I thought you said
you were a bachelor...

42:24.940 --> 42:26.989
- Er... Recently divorced.
- I see.

42:27.461 --> 42:29.509
Sometimes I forget
I'm not married anymore.

42:29.796 --> 42:31.294
Probably it's just stress.

42:34.330 --> 42:35.483
What are you-- ?

42:43.515 --> 42:45.688
Who are you?
How did you get on to me?

42:48.131 --> 42:50.860
I'm looking for--a house--

42:51.216 --> 42:51.969
Oh, oh, oh...

42:52.036 --> 42:54.102
I don't think this house
is right for you.

42:54.263 --> 42:56.042
I think you'd be more comfortable
somewhere else.

42:56.305 --> 42:57.768
This house is for a family!

42:57.831 --> 42:59.642
You know what I mean?
A family...!?

42:59.714 --> 43:00.913
... Home, sweet home?!

43:01.075 --> 43:02.246
All that crap!!

43:28.414 --> 43:29.393
OK.

43:30.037 --> 43:31.060
It's alright.

43:33.096 --> 43:34.592
A little order around here...

43:35.984 --> 43:37.918
Just a little order, that's all.

43:38.438 --> 43:40.189
A little order around here!!

43:46.664 --> 43:47.723
Bondurant.

43:50.661 --> 43:51.921
Dr. Bondurant?

43:58.141 --> 43:59.085
Well,

43:59.881 --> 44:01.536
Dr. Bondurant.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.741
Rest in peace, doctor.

44:19.677 --> 44:20.982
Come on, come on, Doctor.
Let's go.

44:30.995 --> 44:32.176
All right, doctor.

44:32.697 --> 44:33.721
We got to go...

44:33.965 --> 44:35.224
... a little ride.

44:36.102 --> 44:36.740
We'll take a little ride.

44:37.187 --> 44:41.004
You seem disappointed he didn't
turn out to be Jack the Ripper.

44:42.485 --> 44:43.834
I was wrong, Karen.

44:45.910 --> 44:47.530
I was totally wrong.

44:57.245 --> 44:58.269
Doctor.

45:22.833 --> 45:24.426
Buckle up for safety.

47:09.696 --> 47:10.674
Steph?

47:15.474 --> 47:18.196
I'm sorry, honey. I have some
bad news about Dr. Bondurant.

47:20.065 --> 47:21.481
His office just called.

47:23.191 --> 47:25.913
What? I shouldn't go
to my hour tomorrow?

47:26.119 --> 47:28.291
No, no. It's more
serious than that.

47:30.234 --> 47:32.957
There was an accident sometime
last night up by the highway.

47:33.836 --> 47:36.795
He-- lost control or something,
his car went off the road.

47:38.103 --> 47:39.399
His car?

47:44.225 --> 47:45.248
He's dead, Steph.

47:48.998 --> 47:50.101
Sorry.

47:53.124 --> 47:54.243
What happened?

47:55.521 --> 47:56.955
Nobody knows.

47:57.501 --> 47:59.865
Police say he lost
control of his car.

48:00.588 --> 48:02.872
Just one of those stupid
unnecessary accidents.

48:05.906 --> 48:07.718
He was my friend!

48:08.959 --> 48:10.112
I know, baby.

48:13.656 --> 48:15.828
He was a very special man.

48:17.099 --> 48:19.587
In his own way, he helped
bring us together.

48:23.194 --> 48:25.287
And nothing is ever
gonna split us apart.

50:20.929 --> 50:22.234
Can I help?

50:23.326 --> 50:24.708
Yeah, would you honey?
Thanks.

50:29.923 --> 50:31.340
What do you think?

50:32.346 --> 50:33.460
I like it!

50:33.546 --> 50:34.711
Is it straight?

50:36.521 --> 50:37.658
A little bit towards me.

50:38.737 --> 50:39.681
Perfect!

50:42.772 --> 50:44.427
- Jerry...
- Yeah?

50:47.879 --> 50:49.420
I just wanna say that...

50:50.411 --> 50:52.110
I know I've been a
lot of trouble.

50:53.022 --> 50:54.159
And I'm sorry...

50:57.297 --> 51:00.572
Well, let's say we owe each other
an apology and bury the hatchets.

51:02.046 --> 51:03.071
Deal.

51:09.004 --> 51:11.938
When I was a kid I went through
some pretty rough times myself.

51:13.939 --> 51:15.148
So, what happened?

51:16.653 --> 51:18.633
I outgrew my problems
and so will you.

51:19.518 --> 51:21.533
Besides, you'll be too busy
checking boyfriends.

51:22.554 --> 51:23.656
Boyfriends?

51:24.018 --> 51:27.766
Yeah, you know...
Boys, girls, dating.

51:29.796 --> 51:32.486
He's so old fashioned.
Aren't you?

51:32.645 --> 51:35.368
Guilty as charged, Your Honor.

51:36.920 --> 51:38.776
There's plenty of time
for that, sweetheart.

51:39.294 --> 51:40.869
Don't try to grow up
too fast, huh?

51:41.035 --> 51:42.137
OK.

51:42.855 --> 51:45.186
It'll be nice with a family of
birds leaving in there.

52:25.674 --> 52:26.810
Dear Lord,

52:27.375 --> 52:29.582
we thank you for the meal
we're about to enjoy,

52:30.661 --> 52:32.395
for our dear friends,

52:32.758 --> 52:34.807
our wonderful home,

52:35.523 --> 52:36.828
but most of all, Father,

52:37.111 --> 52:40.465
we thank you for bringing us
together as a family.

52:42.296 --> 52:44.248
- Amen.
- Amen.

52:50.408 --> 52:51.984
Oh... sweetheart,

52:52.476 --> 52:55.087
everything looks absolutely
perfect.

52:56.632 --> 52:58.442
What do you think of this
turkey, Steph, huh?

52:58.898 --> 53:00.333
Looks almost good enough to eat.

53:00.402 --> 53:01.460
Yeah.

53:01.725 --> 53:04.336
What do you say if we cut up
this bird? Steph?

53:04.398 --> 53:05.536
Light or dark?

53:05.937 --> 53:08.898
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess.
You're the...

53:10.107 --> 53:11.245
... drumstick-type.

53:11.268 --> 53:12.957
Two drumstick-type.

53:17.593 --> 53:18.746
You know?

53:19.800 --> 53:21.504
Until this moment,

53:23.181 --> 53:25.966
I never realized what
Thanksgiving was all about.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.298
Well, if it isn't
the Road Warrior!

54:05.775 --> 54:08.028
- Come on, hop on.
- Looks dangerous...

54:08.389 --> 54:11.558
<i>- No, this bike is totally safe.
- I meant you.</i>

54:11.751 --> 54:15.748
Me? You are the dangerous one,
you and that mean right hook.

54:15.907 --> 54:17.765
Come on... Chicken.

54:21.159 --> 54:22.829
Only if I get to drive.

54:24.506 --> 54:28.142
So how come you're not with ever
popular Kathy Lombardo tonight?

54:28.621 --> 54:30.748
Kathy Lombardo is a
stuck up bitch.

54:30.917 --> 54:32.255
She dumped you!

54:32.498 --> 54:34.074
No, no! I dumped her.

54:34.636 --> 54:36.134
Alright, alright,
she dumped me.

54:36.497 --> 54:39.140
Come on! Watch where
you're going. Easy.

54:40.098 --> 54:43.181
We're OK now. You can stop
holding on so tight.

54:43.581 --> 54:44.715
Do I have to?

54:45.599 --> 54:47.062
Not if you don't want to.

54:59.647 --> 55:01.617
- I walk you up.
- OK.

55:13.349 --> 55:15.002
Well, thanks for the ride.

55:15.634 --> 55:18.031
- It's your bike.
- Right.

55:20.461 --> 55:22.065
Well...

55:22.671 --> 55:24.500
- Good night.
- Good night.

55:26.963 --> 55:29.010
I-I- guess I'll see you
in school, huh?

55:29.970 --> 55:31.275
I guess so.

55:34.797 --> 55:36.181
That's the Miller's dog.

55:36.340 --> 55:37.445
Yeah.

55:40.140 --> 55:42.548
Anyway-- er-- bye.

55:43.266 --> 55:44.403
Bye...

55:58.067 --> 55:59.091
You!

56:00.678 --> 56:03.370
You could go to jail!
This girl is 16 years old!

56:03.529 --> 56:06.015
- And so am I.
- Jerry. What's wrong?

56:06.180 --> 56:08.227
This punk was trying
to rape our daughter!

56:08.396 --> 56:09.734
I just kissed her good night!

56:09.899 --> 56:11.396
Stephanie? What's going on?

56:11.563 --> 56:14.388
- Go home, Paul!
- Steph, are you sure?

56:14.728 --> 56:16.197
Go home and I'll talk to you
tomorrow...Go!

56:16.265 --> 56:18.087
Would somebody please tell me
what this is all about?

56:18.289 --> 56:19.427
He kissed me good night.

56:19.991 --> 56:22.355
I wanted him to.
I like Paul, Mom!

56:22.524 --> 56:26.238
- Of course you do, honey...
- She's still a child!

56:26.402 --> 56:27.582
I'm not a child!

56:28.143 --> 56:31.417
Just 'cause you're a crazy
demented about sex!

56:31.586 --> 56:34.703
- Don't you talk to your father
that way!
- He's not my father.

56:35.464 --> 56:38.346
He's just some crazy creep!
How can you even bare to...

56:38.410 --> 56:39.529
... let him touch you?
- Stop it!

56:39.700 --> 56:42.107
He's your father now and
you'll respect him!

56:45.121 --> 56:47.654
Stephanie!
Stephanie, come back!

56:48.089 --> 56:50.855
Let her go, Susan. She'll come
back when she calms down.

56:50.869 --> 56:52.202
What were you thinking of...

56:52.363 --> 56:55.054
... making such a stupid scene?
- That punk was undressing her!

56:55.212 --> 56:57.744
That's Paul Baker. I've known him
longer than I've known you!

56:58.616 --> 57:01.904
- Meaning what?
- All the progress we've made

57:02.067 --> 57:06.169
with Stephanie thrown away,
just thrown away! by you!

57:13.583 --> 57:14.562
I...

57:47.810 --> 57:49.778
- Bye, Ron.
- Good luck. Take care.

57:51.015 --> 57:53.107
- Good bye, Audrey, don't work
too hard, uh? - Good luck!

57:53.705 --> 57:55.279
Bye Sylvia, thanks for everything.

58:05.062 --> 58:06.919
- Bye everybody!
- Bye, Jerry!

58:10.286 --> 58:12.900
- We'll miss you, Jerry.
- Thanks, Mr. Grace.

58:13.066 --> 58:14.313
- Good luck.
- Thanks for everything. Good bye.

58:28.380 --> 58:31.937
Just listen to me. All I'm saying
is that the guy just married again,

58:32.181 --> 58:34.109
to a divorcee with kids or
a widow. I know him!

58:34.177 --> 58:36.485
This guy can not live
without a family.

58:37.002 --> 58:39.339
- Now, you gotta help me!
- I don't have time.

58:39.500 --> 58:41.646
Come on! All I'm asking for are
copies of marriage certificates

58:41.724 --> 58:45.110
for the last year. How much
time is that gonna take?

58:45.318 --> 58:47.366
More time than I've got
or care to spare.

58:47.534 --> 58:49.188
Come back in a couple of weeks.

58:49.354 --> 58:51.369
- I need them now!
- Good bye...

58:52.408 --> 58:54.997
- Asshole.
- You're not qualified.

58:55.132 --> 58:57.627
- What?
- To call him asshole.

58:57.970 --> 59:00.040
It's an earned privilege. You have
to know him for half an hour.

59:00.668 --> 59:03.358
Well, perhaps you can help me
here, Miss... Barnes.

59:03.805 --> 59:06.871
I could. The question is:
why should I?

59:06.975 --> 59:09.295
Because the asshole wouldn't
like it, and I would.

59:10.884 --> 59:12.188
What do you say, Miss Barnes?

59:14.416 --> 59:15.581
I say...

59:16.497 --> 59:18.747
... you're qualified to call
me Annie.

59:19.522 --> 59:20.499
Ok.

59:22.529 --> 59:24.228
Honey... honey!

59:25.282 --> 59:29.171
They say this Dr. is one of the
best. Have a good session, huh?

59:49.743 --> 59:50.958
Miss Maine?

59:51.286 --> 59:52.671
Miss Stephanie Maine?

59:52.830 --> 59:55.020
Sorry, wrong office.

01:01:24.509 --> 01:01:26.033
- Mr. Meredith?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:01:27.421 --> 01:01:29.025
Sorry to have bothered you.
Thanks.

01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:50.380
Over here.

01:04:00.823 --> 01:04:03.433
This house was supposed to be
empty. I'm sorry about that.

01:04:17.924 --> 01:04:21.461
- Hi, I'm Bill Hodgkins.
- The man who phoned about the job?

01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:22.844
- That's right.
- Roy Chesterton.

01:04:22.909 --> 01:04:24.045
How'd you do?

01:04:24.253 --> 01:04:27.216
- You ever sold insurance before?
- Back east in Pennsylvania.

01:04:27.579 --> 01:04:29.942
If there's a policy I haven't sold
I'd like to know what it is.

01:04:30.112 --> 01:04:31.843
Especialized in any one area?

01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:34.510
Well, I'm pretty comfortable
in all of them but if I have a

01:04:34.523 --> 01:04:37.985
personal crusade, it's family
related policies, life insurance.

01:04:38.146 --> 01:04:41.263
That's a toughy. People don't
wanna think they're gonna die

01:04:42.141 --> 01:04:44.191
- I know I don't.
- Death is always something

01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:45.743
that happens to someone else.

01:04:46.139 --> 01:04:48.672
That's why I really believe that
I'm protecting the family.

01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:52.106
I'm glad to hear you say that.
That's our main objective here.

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.143
Jerry?

01:05:39.375 --> 01:05:40.838
We have to talk, honey.

01:05:41.709 --> 01:05:42.577
About what?

01:05:42.807 --> 01:05:43.848
About what?

01:05:45.368 --> 01:05:47.672
About what is happening
to our family.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.676
I'm taking care of it.

01:05:52.117 --> 01:05:53.508
By yourself?

01:06:21.205 --> 01:06:22.982
Daddy is home!
Daddy is home!

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.610
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Look who's here!

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:30.814
- Yes?
- Hi! Is Gerald Blake home?

01:07:30.981 --> 01:07:33.189
No. Was he supposed to show
you a house?

01:07:33.753 --> 01:07:34.810
He sells houses?

01:07:34.979 --> 01:07:36.442
Yes, he does.

01:07:36.878 --> 01:07:38.015
Can I help you?

01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:39.804
No, I'll just drop by later.

01:07:40.479 --> 01:07:42.134
See, I'm not even sure it's
the same Gerald Blake.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.481
Well, I can give him a
message for you.

01:07:43.646 --> 01:07:44.828
No, that's okay.

01:07:46.099 --> 01:07:48.383
If it's the guy I know, I'd
rather just surprise him.

01:07:48.949 --> 01:07:50.368
- All right.
- Ok, thanks.

01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:51.749
You're welcome.

01:08:23.303 --> 01:08:24.281
Hi.

01:08:25.006 --> 01:08:26.062
Hello.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.001
I'm Bill Hodgkins. I've just
rented the house next door.

01:08:30.182 --> 01:08:31.240
So, we're neighbors.

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:34.118
I'm Dorothy Reinhard.

01:08:34.661 --> 01:08:36.045
Welcome to Madison St.

01:08:36.299 --> 01:08:37.062
Thank you.

01:08:39.002 --> 01:08:40.009
Hard work.

01:08:40.174 --> 01:08:43.871
Oh, the kids were supposed to do
it, but... you know how kids are.

01:08:45.197 --> 01:08:47.256
It's just you and the kids, then?

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:48.986
Yeah.

01:08:52.474 --> 01:08:53.611
Jerry Blake, please?

01:08:53.971 --> 01:08:57.055
I'm sorry but Mr. Blake is no
longer connected with this agency.

01:08:57.872 --> 01:08:59.542
There must be some mistake.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.136
<i>No, there isn't. I can give you
his home number though. It's...</i>

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:05.270
I know that number! I'm calling
from that number.

01:09:05.511 --> 01:09:07.953
I'm sorry, Madam, but Mr. Blake
left several days ago.

01:09:10.868 --> 01:09:12.175
Well, thank you very much.

01:09:24.246 --> 01:09:25.946
- It's about time!
- Mrs. Fairfax?

01:09:26.157 --> 01:09:31.245
Not for long. Put this in the
trunk. I'm leaving now!

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.779
Is this him? Is this the guy?

01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:36.956
Sure, I'm having an affair
with the cab driver.

01:09:37.118 --> 01:09:39.649
You let her in your cab and I'll
break every bone in your body!

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:42.970
- I'm not a cab driver, okay?
- OK.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.145
I just wanna ask you a question.

01:09:45.706 --> 01:09:47.484
You ever seen this guy before?

01:09:48.871 --> 01:09:51.403
The beard's new, but he looks like
the guy who sold us this house.

01:09:51.742 --> 01:09:53.206
- Muriel?
- Could be him.

01:09:53.604 --> 01:09:54.863
He sells houses?

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.740
Yeah... that's right.

01:10:08.736 --> 01:10:10.595
Hey, what the hell are you
doing, buddy?

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.213
Hi, honey.

01:10:33.017 --> 01:10:34.232
Where've you been?

01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:36.585
Showing the Morton house to
some folks from California.

01:10:36.851 --> 01:10:39.287
- Don't lie to me, Jerry.
- What?

01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:41.203
I called your office today.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:42.768
I didn't get the message.

01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:45.415
Of course you didn't. They said
you stopped working there...

01:10:45.482 --> 01:10:47.865
... several days ago.
- What?

01:10:48.604 --> 01:10:50.494
The recepcionist said
that you left!

01:10:50.757 --> 01:10:51.932
That idiot!

01:10:52.104 --> 01:10:54.614
That new girl can't...
Susan... I've never

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.589
got anyone fired in my life,

01:10:56.756 --> 01:10:59.148
but that girl... I don't know...
- You mean you still work there?

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:01.299
Of course. Where else
would I be?

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.999
I don't know! I just-I don't

01:11:04.162 --> 01:11:06.222
know what I thought. Sorry.

01:11:06.289 --> 01:11:08.285
This is very upsetting. I hope
Grace is still there...

01:11:08.455 --> 01:11:11.608
No, forget it, honey.
Forget it! She probably just--

01:11:12.158 --> 01:11:13.908
got the name wrong or
something.

01:11:13.972 --> 01:11:15.975
Hodgkins! What's to get wrong?

01:11:16.751 --> 01:11:17.855
What did you say?

01:11:18.126 --> 01:11:19.150
What?

01:11:21.021 --> 01:11:22.500
Wait a minute...

01:11:23.818 --> 01:11:25.000
Who am I here?

01:11:26.272 --> 01:11:27.328
Jerry... !

01:11:27.657 --> 01:11:29.159
Jerry?

01:11:30.585 --> 01:11:33.466
Jerry Blake. Thank you, honey.

01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:44.060
You're alright, sweetheart?

01:11:45.624 --> 01:11:46.648
Jerry?

01:11:50.453 --> 01:11:53.255
Where are you going?
Susan! Susan, come here!

01:11:53.499 --> 01:11:54.680
Come here!

01:12:23.715 --> 01:12:25.684
A little order around here, huh!

01:12:30.656 --> 01:12:31.769
Come on, Rinnie.

01:12:32.628 --> 01:12:34.319
Come on, Rinnie. Come on, fella.

01:12:34.864 --> 01:12:36.219
Come on, come on...

01:12:36.492 --> 01:12:37.734
Come on, fella, come on...

01:12:38.665 --> 01:12:40.636
Come see me, come on...

01:12:41.013 --> 01:12:43.062
Here boy, here boy.

01:12:43.731 --> 01:12:47.479
Yeah! That's my little fella.

01:12:47.649 --> 01:12:49.776
That's a good Rinnie,
that's a good Rinnie, yeah.

01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:57.069
Oh, yes! Yeah, you're a good dog.

01:12:57.513 --> 01:12:58.671
You're a good dog!

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:00.263
Mom?

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.686
Mom? you home?

01:13:07.485 --> 01:13:10.839
Hey. What they do? Leave you
alone?

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:18.849
You're a very bad girl...

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.372
Come on, move!

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:25.459
Come on! Come on!

01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:53.141
Jim...

01:14:55.718 --> 01:14:57.104
Jim Ogilvie!

01:14:58.292 --> 01:14:59.631
That's-- blood.

01:15:34.072 --> 01:15:35.332
Next time, Jim,

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.536
call before you drop by.

01:15:56.624 --> 01:15:58.127
Hi, pumpkin.

01:16:06.087 --> 01:16:07.679
Steph...

01:16:09.127 --> 01:16:10.562
Help! Somebody help me!

01:16:12.546 --> 01:16:15.333
Help! Please!!
Somebody help me!

01:16:17.075 --> 01:16:20.160
Help me! Help!

01:16:29.478 --> 01:16:30.861
Open the door!!

01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:32.080
Open the... damned...

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:33.194
door!!

01:16:51.592 --> 01:16:52.536
Oh, no!

01:16:53.016 --> 01:16:53.995
No!

01:16:54.451 --> 01:16:55.701
Help!

01:17:06.005 --> 01:17:07.554
Come on down, Steph!

01:17:26.307 --> 01:17:27.285
Steph!

01:17:30.472 --> 01:17:32.712
It's ok, sweetheart, I won't
hurt you.

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.755
Steph, come out here now!
Get out here!!

01:17:40.127 --> 01:17:41.263
Steph.

01:17:42.937 --> 01:17:44.074
Come on, honey.

01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:46.373
Where are you, Steph?

01:17:50.693 --> 01:17:52.236
Come on, honey, it's alright.

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:56.746
It's all a game, Steph, uh?

01:18:00.277 --> 01:18:01.784
Come on, Steph, it was all a...

01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:02.505
... misunderstanding!!

01:18:02.599 --> 01:18:03.877
No!

01:18:05.886 --> 01:18:08.195
- No!! Please!!
- Come to Daddy! Come here!

01:18:08.355 --> 01:18:10.157
- Come here!
- No!! Please!!

01:18:12.501 --> 01:18:13.812
Stephanie!

01:18:14.551 --> 01:18:16.053
Stephanie!!

01:19:00.081 --> 01:19:01.314
Stephanie!

01:19:01.716 --> 01:19:02.854
Stephanie?

01:19:03.261 --> 01:19:04.204
Mommy?

01:19:18.447 --> 01:19:19.787
No, Jerry!

01:19:30.033 --> 01:19:31.554
Stephanie, the knife!

01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:38.925
Leave her alone!!

01:19:50.171 --> 01:19:51.385
Stephanie!

01:19:56.344 --> 01:19:57.639
Stop it!

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:11.042
I... I love you...
