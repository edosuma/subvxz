17:54.900 --> 17:58.900
You can wear my dressing gown, which
fortunately used to be your dressing gown.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.511
Yeah, for all of a week.

18:00.620 --> 18:04.705
- You never wore it.
- Never had the chance.

18:04.820 --> 18:07.107
This is nice. It's lovely.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.301
I like it.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.750
Thank you.

18:14.860 --> 18:18.581
- Been working out?
- Being funny?

18:20.820 --> 18:25.781
Er... have I... have I
been here before, the village?

18:25.900 --> 18:28.949
Not that I know, not with me. Why?

18:29.060 --> 18:32.143
I don't know really.
It looks familiar. I thought I had.

18:32.260 --> 18:33.830
Part familiar.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.624
I'd lose the socks if I were you.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.860
(TUTS) Okay.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.983
You look nice, by the way.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.702
- You look well.
- Well?

18:55.660 --> 18:57.663
You... lovely. You look lovely.

18:58.460 --> 18:59.871
Well fit.

19:03.300 --> 19:07.783
- How long's it been now?
- Almost a year.

Hm. Christ.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.586
Beautiful is the word I was looking for.
You look beautiful.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.391
Thank you.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.183
- You could use a wash.
- Yeah.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.621
It's all in your hair.

19:27.740 --> 19:29.982
Mucky pup.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.461
- You've lost weight.

19:34.580 --> 19:36.389
Just a little.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.142
You smell like you.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.621
That's because I am me.

I've been here for almost an hour

20:45.900 --> 20:48.380
and you haven't even offered me
so much as a cup of tea.

20:54.780 --> 20:57.022
- Oh, bugger.
- What?

20:57.140 --> 20:59.871
Need the loo. Don't wanna move.

21:32.060 --> 21:34.302
My turn. Then I'll make you that tea.

It can wait.

You must be hungry?

21:48.540 --> 21:51.510
I teach a few hours at a few schools locally.

21:51.620 --> 21:55.261
I play Saturdays at a hotel
about five miles from here

21:55.380 --> 21:57.701
and I give lessons.

21:57.820 --> 22:01.142
I make ends meet. What else is there?

22:01.260 --> 22:02.910
Sounds good.

22:03.020 --> 22:08.584
It's nice, I like it, and the train
is just a muddy field away.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.021
The village, ten minutes' walk.

22:12.780 --> 22:15.351
So, how did you manage
to turn right instead of left?

22:15.460 --> 22:16.951
Oh...

22:17.700 --> 22:20.351
Disoriented by my fall.

22:21.060 --> 22:23.711
And how did you manage to fall?

22:29.860 --> 22:34.184
Er... I was running because
I thought I'd seen her.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.581
There was a girl in a yellow raincoat.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.987
I turned the corner
out of the station and I...

22:41.100 --> 22:45.105
She went towards the village
so I followed her.

22:46.140 --> 22:49.383
- You followed her?
- I'm an idiot.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.831
I'm still looking for her.

22:53.940 --> 22:57.945
Not actively, just out
of the corner of my eye.

22:59.620 --> 23:02.021
I am a little bit better.

23:05.860 --> 23:07.351
Have you still got your private detective?

23:07.460 --> 23:11.021
No. No, he gave up. I think
he got bored of taking my money.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.471
So, that was good of him.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.469
After he'd finished paying off his mortgage.

23:14.580 --> 23:16.071
Probably.

23:20.620 --> 23:24.227
If it's any consolation, I see her too.

23:24.340 --> 23:27.423
But I make sure
I'm doing other things as well.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.702
She's out there.

23:30.420 --> 23:31.911
Yes.

I'm writing a story about a boy
who wants to become a fish.

23:48.980 --> 23:50.391
Why does he want to become a fish?

23:50.500 --> 23:53.071
I can't tell you that. It's top, top secret.

23:53.180 --> 23:56.502
- Why not a dog?
- It's been done before.

23:56.620 --> 23:59.703
And dogs sniff other dogs' balls. Arses.

23:59.820 --> 24:03.188
- Who'd want to do that?
- It's gross. Kids would love it.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.621
Yeah. Yeah, they would.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.983
I'll just check on your clothes.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.501
Wouldn't want them to shrink.

At four o'clock and... and there's
another at six-ish, I think.

- Dry as a bone.
- Thank you.

24:34.580 --> 24:37.982
- Are you finished with that?
- Yeah, yes.

24:40.700 --> 24:43.670
Are we gonna talk about
what happened just now?

I'm surprised I remembered what to do.

there hasn't been anyone else.

- 'Not a good idea?'
- Not really.

25:45.020 --> 25:46.943

have to be a bad thing.

A bad thing happened
and we've got to live with it.

26:26.140 --> 26:27.665

in Sweden that have proven...

28:17.460 --> 28:19.940
when she almost writes her name

33:45.580 --> 33:47.822

33:49.220 --> 33:51.029
Yeah.

She's doing five things at once,
as usual, making dinner.

34:32.820 --> 34:36.380
Oh, I met the PM the other week,
the Prime Minister.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.788
- He's an arsehole.
- Very charming arsehole.

34:39.900 --> 34:43.382
Aren't they all? What did he want you for?

34:43.500 --> 34:47.190
Charles Darke, my publisher, ex-publisher,
is also retiring from government

34:47.300 --> 34:50.065
and the Prime Minister wants
to know if I can find out why.

34:50.179 --> 34:52.626
Well, maybe he's developed a conscience,

34:52.739 --> 34:55.027

34:55.139 --> 34:56.949
I want to see him. Charles, I mean.

34:57.060 --> 34:58.790
But I feel like now, if I do,
I'd be spying on him.

34:59.460 --> 35:03.021
If you wanna see Charles,
you should go and see him.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.341
Could you write it down, please?

36:46.460 --> 36:49.464
Yeah, if that's what you'd like, sure.

your strength from.

I went to see Julie.

37:45.660 --> 37:48.231
- Saw her when?
- Where?

37:48.340 --> 37:49.501
At her cottage.

37:49.620 --> 37:53.341
It's just outside a village
called Stanton Lowe in Kent.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.906
- Nice?
- Very nice. Peaceful.

37:56.020 --> 37:58.500
Mm. How's she doing?

37:58.620 --> 38:00.702
Oh, she's doing well.
She's doing bits and bobs.

38:01.300 --> 38:04.145
We just had a cup of tea. She sends her love.

38:05.060 --> 38:08.747
- Will you be seeing her again?
- As and when, yeah.

38:08.860 --> 38:10.590
Good.

38:14.060 --> 38:15.664
The village was really familiar.

38:15.780 --> 38:19.102
Er... there's a pub there called The Bell.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.590
Did we ever go there before?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.509

38:23.620 --> 38:25.270
- Stanton Lowe?
- Yeah.

38:25.380 --> 38:26.825
No.

No, I remember a pub called The Bell,
but from years ago.

38:33.380 --> 38:36.190
- We stopped off at a pub.
- Stanton Lowe?

38:36.300 --> 38:37.870
I don't remember the name of the village.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.220
When did we go on a bike ride?

38:39.340 --> 38:40.831
- Before we were married.
- Christ.

38:40.940 --> 38:44.467
We borrowed the bikes
from your shifty friend Paul

38:44.580 --> 38:47.231

38:47.340 --> 38:49.149

49:35.340 --> 49:36.671
Every "dis" under the sun.

49:36.780 --> 49:39.590
- Why?
- Why do you think?

49:41.620 --> 49:45.750
You need a shave, Charles.
You have a man's stubble.

49:45.860 --> 49:48.431
Look down the front of your pants
and you have a hairy pair of bollocks.

49:48.540 --> 49:50.349
Yeah, well, that is where
you're wrong. So there.

49:50.460 --> 49:52.781
- (BLOWS RASPBERRY)
- Where are you going now?

49:53.620 --> 49:55.111
Climb a tree!

49:55.220 --> 49:56.711
Charles?

50:00.420 --> 50:01.911
Charles!

50:02.020 --> 50:03.431
This is ridiculous.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.907
Charles! Fuck's sake.

50:06.020 --> 50:08.023
Be careful!

50:08.140 --> 50:11.542
It's easy with practice!

50:11.660 --> 50:14.391
Charles! Charles, that's high enough!

50:19.220 --> 50:21.029
Wolves.

50:23.860 --> 50:27.421
Where does all this leave you now, Thelma?

50:28.260 --> 50:30.069
What are you? Are you his wife?

50:30.180 --> 50:33.502
Yes, I'm his wife. Course I'm his wife.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.941
It's why I'm still here.

50:36.060 --> 50:38.506
Putting up with it?

50:38.620 --> 50:39.860
Waiting.

50:42.340 --> 50:44.741
- (GRUNTS)
- Thank you.

50:44.860 --> 50:49.423
Every day, I remind myself
that it's what he wants.

50:51.900 --> 50:55.746
And he's out of time. And that's all.

50:55.860 --> 51:00.104
- Not out of his mind?
- Why can't it be real?

51:01.620 --> 51:04.544
I mean, we all look older
but how many of us actually grow up?

51:04.660 --> 51:08.108
- Look at the books you write.
- He's a grown man.

51:08.220 --> 51:11.030
He's a brilliant and sophisticated man.

51:12.780 --> 51:15.181
And you want him back.

51:28.580 --> 51:32.551
He'll be disappointed
that you won't stay longer.

51:32.660 --> 51:36.824
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll get over it.

51:36.940 --> 51:40.388
Sorry. I really am being an arsehole.

51:40.500 --> 51:41.991
Yes, you are.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.501
(CHUCKLES)

51:44.620 --> 51:46.941
Well, you're right. I just...
I want him back, and you,

51:47.060 --> 51:48.949
and I'm feeling very sorry for myself.

51:49.060 --> 51:52.143
So, there you go. I'm being childish.

51:52.260 --> 51:54.661
Must be contagious.

51:54.780 --> 51:56.589
(CHUCKLES)

51:57.980 --> 51:59.471
Sorry.

52:02.220 --> 52:05.907
I was... I was a bit of a bully
to him out in the woods.

52:06.020 --> 52:09.707
- I should tell him I'm sorry.
- You are the grown-up.

52:09.820 --> 52:10.821
(CHUCKLES)

52:13.980 --> 52:15.471
Charles?

52:17.980 --> 52:20.790
- Charles?
- Busy.

52:24.380 --> 52:25.950
Charles, look, I'm... I'm sorry.

52:26.060 --> 52:28.830
When we were in the den, and you were
talking about finding a missing child,

52:28.940 --> 52:31.944
all I could do was think of Kate and...

52:32.580 --> 52:34.901
I thought you were comparing.

52:37.620 --> 52:41.386
- I would never do that.
- No, I know. I know.

52:41.500 --> 52:43.901
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

52:47.260 --> 52:48.751
It's okay.

52:50.260 --> 52:51.421
It's fine.

52:54.140 --> 52:57.462
- Shall I come in?
- Er...

52:59.380 --> 53:01.189
- I betrayed you.
- What?

53:01.300 --> 53:04.304
- No, you haven't.
- I have.

53:05.380 --> 53:08.623
- You'll see.
- Bollocks. Hairy or otherwise.

53:11.340 --> 53:13.741
I should walk the plank.

53:17.300 --> 53:19.621
You think you'll ever find Kate?

53:22.380 --> 53:25.190
Well, I hope I will.

53:27.700 --> 53:31.022
I'll never believe
that I'll never find her so...

53:31.140 --> 53:33.029
She'll have grown.

53:33.140 --> 53:34.949
Yes.

53:35.060 --> 53:38.382
If you find her ten years from now,

53:38.500 --> 53:41.231
she'll be a young woman, almost.

53:41.340 --> 53:43.991
Yes, but she'll still be Kate.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.947
She'll still be my little girl.

53:49.340 --> 53:52.310
You wanna take her to the park

53:52.420 --> 53:55.424
and to the slide and swings and just...

53:56.780 --> 54:00.182
...just catch up
on all those things you missed.

54:02.460 --> 54:05.464
- I'm not comparing, you understand?
- No, I understand.

54:07.300 --> 54:08.950
And, er...

54:09.660 --> 54:11.230
...I'll try to understand. I...

54:13.660 --> 54:15.151
...promise.

54:20.420 --> 54:22.741
Thanks for coming, Stephen.

54:24.300 --> 54:26.462
You're my best friend.

54:28.260 --> 54:29.751
Charles.

54:32.940 --> 54:34.431
What?

54:40.820 --> 54:42.629
Night-night.

54:43.820 --> 54:45.311
Night.

56:29.780 --> 56:31.271
- Stop, stop the car.
- What?

56:31.380 --> 56:33.348
- Stop the car.
- I can't, mate. I'm on a red route.

56:33.460 --> 56:36.031
- Stop!
- Mate, there's cameras.

56:36.140 --> 56:38.871
Stop the car! Stop it.

TEACHER: So, your creative writing exercise
is to write about your day at the zoo.

57:39.100 --> 57:40.909
So, if you can get to your tables, please.

57:41.020 --> 57:42.988
Thank you, everyone.

57:43.100 --> 57:46.263
And you can do some pictures too.

58:02.740 --> 58:05.266
Hello. Do you know who I am?

58:07.260 --> 58:09.342
Excuse me. Can I help you?

58:09.460 --> 58:11.542
- What are you doing?
- I'm saying hello.

58:11.660 --> 58:13.469
Now's not the time or place.

58:13.580 --> 58:16.231
No, I don't think you understand. I'm her...

58:16.340 --> 58:19.025
I'm sorry. Can I speak to you
in private, please, outside?

58:19.140 --> 58:20.631
Please.

58:22.020 --> 58:24.182
Children, on with our work, please.

58:29.620 --> 58:33.022
Er... look, I might...
I might as well just say it.

58:33.140 --> 58:34.904
The girl that I was just talking to just now,

58:35.020 --> 58:38.820
that girl sitting right there,
she's my daughter.

58:38.940 --> 58:40.670
- Ruth?
- No, her name's Kate.

58:40.780 --> 58:45.991
Her real name is Kate
and... she's my daughter.

58:47.820 --> 58:48.981
I think I should call the Head.

58:49.100 --> 58:51.262
She's my daughter and she was
abducted three years ago,

58:51.380 --> 58:53.348
which is probably
why she doesn't recognise me.

58:53.460 --> 58:55.781
But she will, she will.
I know she will, because it's her.

58:55.900 --> 58:57.709
It's...

58:58.620 --> 59:00.429
It's Kate.

59:01.180 --> 59:02.989
Mr Lewis.

59:03.100 --> 59:04.909
I do remember your daughter going missing.

59:05.980 --> 59:10.588
The girl you say is your daughter
is Ruth Lyle.

59:10.700 --> 59:13.146
If that's what they've called her, yes.

59:13.260 --> 59:16.548
Can I say I know who they are?

59:16.660 --> 59:19.630
I've known Ruth's father
Jason Lyle for many years.

59:19.740 --> 59:21.743
He's a parent governor.

59:24.020 --> 59:25.511
I know my daughter

59:25.620 --> 59:30.786
and I know that that little girl
out there is my daughter.

59:30.900 --> 59:33.301
Now, look. I'm not gonna shout.
I'm not gonna make a fuss.

59:33.420 --> 59:34.990

you're not going to make
a scene or interrupt.

59:43.540 --> 59:45.065
I'd rather not involve the police.

59:45.180 --> 59:46.989
No, by... by all means, involve the police.

But, no, I'm not gonna make a fuss.

Come in, Ruth.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.025
We won't keep you a moment
and then you can get back to class.

And if you could stay, Mrs Forrester.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:13.551
Ruth, I wonder if you could
tell me your full name, please.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.188
Ruth Elspeth Lyle.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.428
And how old are you?

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.429
Eight, miss.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:24.101
And what's the name
of your older sister at this school?

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.429
Chloe. She's ten, miss.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.225
And when did you first come to St Edward's?

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.583
To the school or to nursery?

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.781
Nursery.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.346
When I was two.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.465
Mrs Forrester? And how long
have you known Ruth?

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.310
Since nursery.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.946
No. No, no, that's not right.
That's not right.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:49.064
Thank you, Mrs Forrester. Thank you, Ruth.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.949
We have school records.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.825
School photographs.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.102
Would you like to see?

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.181
I'm good friends with Ruth's family.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.465
I remember her mother Jaclyn
being pregnant with Ruthie.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.823
That's what they call her...

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.262
...and have always called her.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.306
Is there going to be a problem, Mr Lewis?

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.271
(MOUTHING)

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.111
No.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.950
Sit here as long as you need.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.989
Oh, Kate! Oh!

(TAPPING)

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.586
- MAN: Taxi for Julie?
- Yes.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.029
Yeah, almost there.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.620
Okay, no rush. I'm a bit early anyway.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.743
For five minutes or more,
I thought I'd found her.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.510
Five minutes at least of euphoria.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:58.262
I thought, "I've done it"
and I thought of you and telling you.

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.023
Lucky I wasn't arrested.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:10.431
I think she might have
to be the one to find us.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.869
Can't give up.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.382
Can't give up hope, no.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.903
How certain are you that she's alive?

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.864
I know that if she wasn't, I'd feel it.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.951
Yeah.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.069
I would too.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.580
I know that she's out there.

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:52.742
But I've no idea where
or where to begin looking.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:57.784
It's hard to accept that
we're helpless, but we are.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.822
And all we can do is be here, ready...

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.709
...and sane.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:18.504
You should know I'm going away
for a while, a few months.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.943
Going where?

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.710
Undecided.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:27.791
Somewhere warm.
Somewhere I can get to by train.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.471
France? Not sure.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.583
Why? Why now?

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.023
I want to.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.983
What if I asked you to stay?
A while, a while longer, I mean.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.909
I need to.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.871
You want me to send a postcard?

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.029
You'd better.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.901
Dinner's almost ready.
Just waiting on the potatoes.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.021
Why don't you wait in the warm?

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.667
Oh, I am warm. Besides,
I need to tell you something.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.500
Hm, ominous.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:30.941
I took a trip out to that pub, The Bell.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.228
- When?
- A few weeks ago.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.742
Had to. Couldn't get it out of my head.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.340
You have been there before, in a way.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.030
In... in what way?

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.669
You... were with me, love.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.903
Very much with me.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.781
I remember it so well,

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.791
because that was the day
I told your father I was pregnant.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.063
You weren't planned and
you know we weren't married.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.831
I was dreading telling him, but...

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.903
...it turned out to be a wonderful day.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.026
It was the first time I saw you.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.989
It's true.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.422
I was sick with nerves.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.908
I wasn't sure how your father would react.

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:25.581
Being pregnant was bad news, really.

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:28.021
We'd made plans.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.229
And then...

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.861
...I saw you.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.671
This...

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.422
...beautiful child at the window looking in.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.271
This... face.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.500
I knew it was you.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.270

he was without cynicism.

those early years are...

of a, er... a supportive,

in there as to why he took his own life.
