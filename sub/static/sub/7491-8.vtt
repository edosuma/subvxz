00:02.291 --> 00:03.667
<i>Ohm.</i>
-

00:05.166 --> 00:06.875
Ohm.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.208
Ohm.

00:11.959 --> 00:13.500
Ohm!

00:14.208 --> 00:15.500
I got this one.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.500
What are you doing?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.125
I’m becoming one with the universe.

00:20.208 --> 00:22.792
I am now a master of meditation.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.542
Since when?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.959
Since I got this magical meditation ring.

00:27.041 --> 00:29.000
It changes colors with my mood.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.625
Been in my family for three generations.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.291
Uh-oh. That's not good.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.083
I think that green color means I’m gassy.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.291
It just turned blue.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.709
Yeah, it did.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.834
Come on, guys. Sit.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.375
Enjoy my new meditation zone.

00:45.458 --> 00:47.542
I got a waterfall, my bonsai tree,

00:47.625 --> 00:49.834
I even installed a speaker
directly above the mat

00:49.917 --> 00:51.417
so I can listen to my meditation music.

00:52.458 --> 00:54.917
- Time to transcend.
-

00:55.000 --> 00:57.542
-
- What the heck was that?

00:57.625 --> 01:01.125
- Kung Fu Lightning.
- Greatest band of all time.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.250
- Yeah.
- We were listening to their new album

01:02.291 --> 01:03.667
on your stereo. Sorry.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.166
Well, get it out of there
and put my meditation CD back in.

01:06.291 --> 01:07.291
Okay.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.375
Isn't Kung Fu Lightning
doing a concert here in Seaford?

01:10.458 --> 01:11.917
Oh, yes, they are.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.542
And we're gonna stand in line
for as long as it takes to get tickets.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.834
My mom won't let me go to concerts

01:16.917 --> 01:18.834
unless the characters
are in big padded suits

01:18.917 --> 01:20.208
and on ice skates.

01:21.834 --> 01:24.000
- All right, we'll see you guys later.
Take it easy.

01:24.041 --> 01:25.583
Come on, Eddie. Let's get a corn dog.

01:25.667 --> 01:26.667
Okay.

01:27.375 --> 01:31.000
Finally, I can meditate in peace
and become one with my chi.

01:37.458 --> 01:39.000
-
- What was that?

01:39.083 --> 01:40.709
Ow!

01:40.792 --> 01:43.250
I think I just became one
with my speaker.

Dude, I am a way bigger
Kung Fu Lightning fan than you.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.375
Oh. You see this?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.917
Izzy Gunnar's guitar pick.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.208
I bought it online.

02:42.208 --> 02:43.917
Man, that's nothing.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.709
You remember when he missed that concert
because he had to get his appendix out?

02:46.792 --> 02:48.083
Mm-hmm.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.083
Is that Izzy's appendix?

02:53.583 --> 02:55.583
You're not the only one who shops online.

03:06.542 --> 03:09.041
Rudy, what are you doing with Tootsie?

03:09.125 --> 03:12.458
I’m goat-sitting her for Phil
while he's out of town for the week.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.333
Chicks dig a guy with a goat.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.834
You should see the women
down at the park melt

03:19.917 --> 03:21.500
when Tootsie and I share a seesaw.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.417
- Gotta go.
-

03:28.125 --> 03:30.000
Dude, we've been in this line
for, like, 19 hours.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.333
I gotta go find a bathroom.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.166
Psst.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.834
You know, the line ends four miles back.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.375
If you ladies want, I’ll let you scooch.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.250
Really? You'd do that?

03:51.333 --> 03:52.583
Absolutely.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.500
Hey, this guy said we could cut!

03:55.500 --> 03:56.750
Huh?

03:56.834 --> 03:58.291
Wait. Wait, what?

03:58.375 --> 03:59.583
But, no-- I-- I, uh--

03:59.667 --> 04:00.583
Not cool with this.

04:00.667 --> 04:01.709
Too many dudes.

04:01.792 --> 04:02.917
Way too many dudes.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.625
498, 499, 500.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.917
That's it, everyone.
This guy's getting the last ticket.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.041
Huh?

04:08.125 --> 04:09.917
Well-- well, I said she could scooch,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.500
and then they all scooched
and then everyone was scooching!

04:14.166 --> 04:16.375
- Let's go, you.
- Aah!

04:16.458 --> 04:18.375
<i>♪ And no matter how much

04:18.458 --> 04:21.125
<i>♪ It's not as cool

04:24.083 --> 04:26.500
My little black book
is full of ladies' names.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.208
And now, thanks to Tootsie,

04:28.291 --> 04:30.083
two of them have phone numbers.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.750
Here's the note from Phil
with Tootsie's feeding instructions.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.667
"Crumple this note into a ball
and place it in her bowl."

04:44.333 --> 04:45.458
I’ll have my usual--

04:45.542 --> 04:47.500
a number three with some
baba ghanoush poppers.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.458
Oh, uh, sorry, sir.

04:49.542 --> 04:51.000
The restaurant's closed for the week.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.917
Guess I’ll try that new place,
Falafel Franco's.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.542
Uh, hold on, sir.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.125
Have a seat, your order will be right up.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.208
Milton, what are you doing?

05:03.291 --> 05:05.083
That guy's a loyal customer.

05:05.166 --> 05:07.792
If he goes to Franco's,
he'll realize how bad Phil's food is.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.083
Come on, people!

05:09.166 --> 05:10.834
These ghanoushes won't baba themselves!

05:14.041 --> 05:15.458
You know, while you guys do that,

05:15.542 --> 05:17.291
I’m gonna meditate and try to get my ring

05:17.417 --> 05:19.458
to go from blue to purple.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.250
That's my <i>love</i> color.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.458
Then I’ll decide which of my ladies to--

05:26.792 --> 05:28.583
My book. My numbers!

05:29.667 --> 05:31.083
My ladies.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.333
Dude! Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.125
We've got tickets.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.625
What?! Whoa, whoa. You got tickets?

05:42.709 --> 05:43.834
Absolutely.

05:43.917 --> 05:46.250
All we have to do is win
the radio station contest.

05:46.291 --> 05:49.000
They're about to call one lucky winner.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.417
Dude, a radio contest?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.834
Do you know what the chances are
that we'll be the one person they call?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.667
Pretty good.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.709
I borrowed all my cousins' phones.
and submitted the numbers.

06:04.291 --> 06:07.709
<i>All right, kids.
Set your phone from vibrate to celebrate.</i>

06:07.792 --> 06:10.250
<i>We're giving away
two Kung Fu Lightning tickets.</i>

06:11.208 --> 06:12.709
-
- Please, please, please.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.166
- Wha?
- Dude.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.458
Dude, I can't believe it.
They're calling us.

06:17.542 --> 06:18.875
- Answer it.
- Okay.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.625
Woo! Hello?

06:21.709 --> 06:23.959
- Hello?
- Which one is it?

06:24.041 --> 06:25.291
- Hello?
<i>Hello?</i>

06:25.375 --> 06:27.291
Oh, sorry, can't talk.
Looking for a phone.

06:27.375 --> 06:28.792
Jerry!

06:28.875 --> 06:30.917
<i>Oh, looks like
they didn't want those tickets.</i>

06:31.583 --> 06:32.875
<i>All right, kids--</i>

06:32.959 --> 06:33.959
I don't believe it, man.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.208
We had the tickets.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.166
Oh, I see where this is going.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.959
Somehow you're gonna find a way
to make this Jerry's fault.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.333
I need two falafel balls with onions.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.542
Two chicks in a hot tub!

06:49.625 --> 06:50.834
Make 'em cry!

06:51.959 --> 06:53.667
Chicks in a hot tub, crying.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.333
- Pick up. Pick up.
-

06:55.417 --> 06:56.667
Jeez.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.667
You guys are really making a go of it.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.166
How'd you get all these people in here?

07:00.250 --> 07:02.834
Well, once Milton changed
the 40-year-old oil in the fryer,

07:02.917 --> 07:04.417
the food started tasting like,

07:04.500 --> 07:06.125
you know, food!

07:08.291 --> 07:09.583
Yo, I’ll tell you one thing--

07:09.667 --> 07:11.458
If Izzy were here right now,

07:11.542 --> 07:12.709
I’d walk right up to him

07:12.792 --> 07:15.041
and tell him his two biggest fans
don't have tickets.

07:15.709 --> 07:16.875
Dude! Dude, dude, dude!

07:16.959 --> 07:19.083
You're gonna get that chance.
That's him sitting right there!

07:19.834 --> 07:21.041
What?

07:21.917 --> 07:23.583
Are you kidding?

07:23.667 --> 07:24.709
Let's see what you got.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.417
Uh...

07:32.500 --> 07:34.875
Me, Jerry.

07:34.959 --> 07:35.792
<i>You.</i>

07:35.875 --> 07:37.083
Music.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.208
Good.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.333
The strumming.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.375
The... <i>♪ Sing, sing, sing, sing ♪</i>

07:42.333 --> 07:44.000
Hair pretty. Bye-bye, man.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.000
Uh.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.291
Hey, I’m Jack. This is my friend, Jerry.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.250
- He's a little bit of a freak.
- Oh, good.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.875
We'll get along fine then.
I’m King of the Freaks.

07:52.959 --> 07:54.041
Check this out.

07:54.125 --> 07:57.000
I’m wearing a bowling shoe
and a roller skate.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.041
But the strange thing is,
when I left the hotel

08:00.125 --> 08:01.625
I was wearing slippers.

08:02.667 --> 08:05.083
Hold on! Spitball opportunity.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.125
-
- Aah!

08:07.208 --> 08:09.041
Yeah!

08:09.125 --> 08:10.917
I love messing with that little weasel.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.792
So what can I do for you, mates?

08:15.875 --> 08:16.875
Uh...

08:17.875 --> 08:19.250
Can we have tickets to your show?

08:19.333 --> 08:22.041
Absolutely not! A lot of nerve
you've got asking me for tickets!

08:22.125 --> 08:24.000
I give you tickets,
I gotta give everyone tickets!

08:24.083 --> 08:25.333
And where does it end?

08:25.709 --> 08:27.875
I’m sorry, man. We're big fans.

08:27.959 --> 08:30.291
Oh, yeah. Well, in that case,
of course, you can have tickets. Here.

08:31.709 --> 08:34.792
Call my manager. Now if you'll excuse me,

08:34.917 --> 08:36.875
I’ve got to either go skate

08:36.959 --> 08:38.166
or bowl.

08:43.959 --> 08:45.208
You know what I like about him?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.542
He's just a regular guy.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.083
Dude. Look, it's his phone.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.250
Hey, hey, Izzy!

08:51.333 --> 08:52.625
- You forgot your phone!
- Yo!

08:53.208 --> 08:55.709
- Hey! Hey!
-

09:05.792 --> 09:07.458
Do you have any idea
why those guys attacked you?

09:07.583 --> 09:09.959
Yes, I do. I know exactly why.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.125
It's 'cause I’m beautiful.

09:12.917 --> 09:15.583
Those moves that you guys did
were amazing. Are you like...

09:16.458 --> 09:17.709
superheroes?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.291
No, we actually do karate--

09:20.375 --> 09:21.291
Shh!

09:21.375 --> 09:23.417
No. Your secret's safe with me,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.166
Wham man and Pow Boy.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.500
I can't believe it!

09:26.583 --> 09:28.500
I got superheroes for bodyguards!

09:30.417 --> 09:31.417
Excuse me?

09:31.500 --> 09:33.709
Well, it's clear I need protection.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.333
You blokes work for me now.

09:35.417 --> 09:36.917
You're gonna love my chauffeur.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.041
He's a wizard.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.166
Do you have any idea what this means?

09:42.250 --> 09:45.083
We're the bodyguards
for the biggest rock star

09:45.166 --> 09:46.083
in the world!

09:46.166 --> 09:47.667
Woo!

09:49.875 --> 09:51.792
Wham man, Pow Boy!

09:51.875 --> 09:53.208
Let's go.

09:53.291 --> 09:54.500
Coming.

09:58.917 --> 10:01.583
Careful with that. Where's Izzy?

10:01.667 --> 10:03.291
Sound check started an hour ago.

10:03.417 --> 10:04.750
Why are you asking me?

10:04.834 --> 10:08.417
But maybe I should practice
lead vocals, you know,

10:08.500 --> 10:11.417
<i>♪ in case he doesn't show up! ♪</i>

10:11.500 --> 10:14.333
Oh, he's not showing.

10:14.417 --> 10:17.041
He gone and ran off
and married a hedgehog.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.291
I got you!

10:19.375 --> 10:22.250
Look at Lars.
He thinks I married a hedgehog.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.792
Izzy? You're here.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.875
- How come you're late?
- Oh, two blokes jumped me.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.750
These guys saved my life.

10:29.834 --> 10:32.208
Meet my new bodyguards, Jack and Jerry.

10:34.291 --> 10:36.500
Don't scream like a girl.
Don't scream like a girl.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.041
Sorry, man.

10:42.667 --> 10:45.917
Rock and roll! Woo!

10:46.000 --> 10:47.166
Really?

10:47.250 --> 10:49.917
These two kids
took down a couple of thugs?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.166
<i>Good.</i>

10:51.250 --> 10:54.166
If you're his bodyguards,
you're also his babysitters.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.041
Here's his schedule.

10:56.125 --> 10:58.375
All right, let's see
what's on tap for today.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.792
We have a sound check.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.333
Woo!

11:01.417 --> 11:02.250
Right. Done.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.500
What's next?

11:03.583 --> 11:05.166
A photoshoot.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.750
A radio interview.

11:06.875 --> 11:07.792
"Approve jewelry."

11:07.875 --> 11:09.041
Let me see that.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.583
I’ve got a better idea.

11:15.291 --> 11:18.166
This is awesome!

11:18.250 --> 11:21.083
How do you know when it's time
to pull the ripcord?

11:21.166 --> 11:22.959
Oh, good idea.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.834
I should probably do it now.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.500
Blimey!

11:27.583 --> 11:28.875
That can't be good.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.583
We're gonna die!

11:33.709 --> 11:36.458
I got you! I got you!

11:37.709 --> 11:39.333
You're a demon!

11:39.417 --> 11:41.041
Woo!

11:41.667 --> 11:43.458
-
- Come on, Milton.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.583
Are we frying or are we dying, man?

11:45.667 --> 11:48.041
I am dragging six super combos out here.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.500
And where is my woodchuck
In a sleeping bag?

11:51.333 --> 11:53.208
I don't even know what that means.

11:53.959 --> 11:55.250
I don't know what it means either,

11:55.291 --> 11:57.125
But I want my ding-dang falafel balls.

11:59.291 --> 12:02.500
Eddie, the drive-thru has
been backed up all morning.

12:02.583 --> 12:03.750
We don't have a drive-thru.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.750
Well, I keep giving food to someone
out the kitchen window.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.458
Rudy.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.291
Your meditation ring is red.

12:11.375 --> 12:12.458
What does that mean?

12:12.542 --> 12:14.417
It means that I’m under a lot of stress.

12:15.208 --> 12:16.083
Or I’m pregnant.

12:16.166 --> 12:19.041
Either way, if my water breaks,
you're driving me to the hospital.

12:19.959 --> 12:21.667
Why don't we just quit?

12:21.750 --> 12:23.250
We can't quit.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.792
Phil would lose all of his business
to Falafel Franco's.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.625
Guys, I was going through the kitchen,
and look what I found.

12:29.709 --> 12:31.542
An automatic falafel ball maker.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.750
- Hey, great. Plug it in.
- No, hang on.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.083
Will a machine ever be able to

12:37.166 --> 12:40.166
handcraft falafel balls
with the same love,

12:40.250 --> 12:41.500
tradition and care

12:41.583 --> 12:43.875
that our customers
have come to expect from us?

12:43.959 --> 12:45.500
It makes 1,000 balls an hour.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.834
Let's plug that bad boy in.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.041
Oh, man. What a day.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.750
That skydiving was crazy!

12:52.834 --> 12:53.792
- Yeah.
- Woo.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.291
You know, you could have planned out
where we were gonna land.

12:56.417 --> 12:57.291
I did.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.375
We were the hit of that rodeo.

12:59.458 --> 13:02.041
Did you see the look on the bull's face

13:02.125 --> 13:04.458
- when Jerry landed on him?
- Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.

13:04.542 --> 13:05.625
Yeah, I saw it.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.834
There you are! Do you realize
your show starts in five minutes?

13:09.917 --> 13:11.583
Let's go, we gotta hurry.

13:13.625 --> 13:14.542
Oh, Jerry.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.667
Hey, let's go find out
where Izzy wants us during the show.

13:16.750 --> 13:17.917
You guys aren't going anywhere.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.125
Playtime's over.

13:19.583 --> 13:20.500
What?

13:20.583 --> 13:22.083
You're not bodyguards,

13:22.166 --> 13:23.875
you're just 14-year-old
punks looking to...

13:23.959 --> 13:25.583
"Hang around with a rock star."

13:25.667 --> 13:27.291
Well, it's over. You're fired.

13:27.417 --> 13:28.583
You can't fire us.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.500
We work for Izzy, not his backup singer.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.208
I’m not a backup.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.000
I’m the guy who started this band

13:36.083 --> 13:37.792
and the one who should be the lead singer.

13:37.875 --> 13:38.875
Get 'em out of here!

13:38.959 --> 13:40.041
Okay, three things.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.083
One, I’m not leaving this room.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.750
Two, there is no way
I’m giving up this swag jacket.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.542
And three-- we're outside aren't we?

13:53.417 --> 13:54.583
-
- All right, guys.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.792
We've made enough falafel balls
for the dinner rush.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.208
- Turn it off.
<i>Okay.</i>

14:00.542 --> 14:01.583
I did.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.875
It must have a battery or something.

14:04.667 --> 14:05.792
Uh, maybe this lever will work.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.750
Oh, this isn't good.

14:08.834 --> 14:10.625
It made the machine go faster!

14:10.709 --> 14:12.625
We gotta find some other containers!

14:14.041 --> 14:15.417
There are no other containers!

14:15.834 --> 14:17.583
We can't let any more hit the floor!

14:18.667 --> 14:20.291
Aah! Oh!

14:20.375 --> 14:21.542
Hot, hot, hot!

14:21.625 --> 14:22.959
Hot!

14:23.041 --> 14:24.000
Oh, no!

14:24.083 --> 14:26.375
Look, my meditation ring's gone.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.291
It must've got mixed in the batter,

14:28.375 --> 14:30.667
which means it's in one of these balls!

14:30.750 --> 14:32.750
Oh! There's too much pressure!

14:32.834 --> 14:35.625
- I’m gonna blow!
<i>You're not gonna blow!</i>

14:36.625 --> 14:38.083
You're not gonna blow.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.375
Help me find my ring.

14:39.458 --> 14:40.709
That's the priority.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.875

15:02.959 --> 15:04.375

15:04.458 --> 15:05.709
I told every girl I know

15:05.792 --> 15:07.625
I was gonna have Izzy
scream their name from stage.

15:08.083 --> 15:09.458
How could he do that?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.583
Well, when Izzy screams,

15:10.667 --> 15:12.959
you can't understand a thing he's saying.
Listen.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.875
Was that Vicky, Kim, or Lori?

15:20.458 --> 15:21.333
Dude, look.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.083
Those are the same guys who jumped Izzy.

15:23.625 --> 15:24.792
Do you know what this means?

15:26.959 --> 15:28.208
Yeah.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.166
They came to apologize.

15:31.792 --> 15:33.208
They're here to finish the job.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.625
And Lars just let them in.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.417
He's the one who hired them to hurt Izzy!

15:37.500 --> 15:39.083
Come one, dude, we gotta get inside.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.000
But how?

15:47.834 --> 15:49.458
All right. All right, people.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.917
Remember, whoever finds the lucky ring

15:52.000 --> 15:53.208
Gets $100.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.125
You guys here?

15:57.208 --> 15:58.291
This doesn't make sense.

15:58.417 --> 16:01.000
We've collected and sold
every falafel ball we made.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.083
Not that one.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.375
My ring.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.500

Tell me again why Rudy brought Tootsie
to his office?

18:10.208 --> 18:11.625
He wanted to be sure that he was there

18:11.709 --> 18:13.166
when she... went,

18:13.250 --> 18:14.750
So he knew where to look.

18:14.834 --> 18:15.709
Don't worry,

18:15.792 --> 18:18.041
He put a lot of newspaper
all over his floor.

18:24.125 --> 18:26.417
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.041
But she's had three bales of hay,
five pounds of prunes,

18:29.125 --> 18:30.959
10 bran muffins and a calculator.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.625
Anyway, I better get back in there.

18:34.709 --> 18:35.917
This could happen any minute.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.166
Ah.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.000
I’ve had an itch under my arm all day.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.208
- Oh.
- Gah.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.625
Wow.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.625
A falafel ball was lodged in my armpit.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.959
Just imagine how upset
Rudy would be if there--

18:52.625 --> 18:53.792
Oh, and there's the ring.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.542
We gotta tell Rudy!

18:57.625 --> 18:59.792
<i>Oh my, are you for real?</i>

19:01.291 --> 19:02.458
<i>What have I done?</i>

19:03.834 --> 19:05.250
I ain't going in there.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.917
Let's just leave it here.

19:08.000 --> 19:08.917
Yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.375
We should go.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.709
How is this even possible?

19:13.792 --> 19:16.291
<i>Oh, the humanity!</i>

19:18.959 --> 19:21.208
<i>-
- Oh, got my calculator back.</i>

19:23.959 --> 19:26.625
How could you? We're like brothers.

19:26.709 --> 19:28.083
I was always in your shadow

19:28.166 --> 19:31.041
while you were out in front
with the fame, the glory...

19:31.125 --> 19:33.208
- my sister.
- Oh.

19:33.291 --> 19:36.375
- I am sorry about Linda.
- Stacy!

19:36.458 --> 19:38.792
Right, yeah, Stacy. Nice girl.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.291
Okay, get him out of here.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.083
Thanks, guys. You saved my life.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.083
Well, you know,
that's just what bodyguards do.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.166
No.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.709
You two are more than bodyguards.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.000
You're my friends.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.375
Guys! Come on the road with me.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.375
Man, that's a great offer,

20:01.458 --> 20:03.083
but we can't leave Seaford.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.583
All of our friends are here.

20:04.667 --> 20:05.709
Yeah, I get it.

20:05.792 --> 20:08.417
You know, I’d give up everything I have

20:08.542 --> 20:10.333
to stay here and have friends like you.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.709
Well, why don't you?

20:11.792 --> 20:13.083
Are you crazy?

20:13.166 --> 20:15.291
I’m a rock star, mate. My life is amazing.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.500
The crowd's not leaving, Izzy.

20:18.583 --> 20:21.083
There gonna tear this place apart
if we don't give them an encore.

Right...

21:09.291 --> 21:11.166
Hey, man. It was great to meet you.

21:11.291 --> 21:12.917
Look us up the next time
you're here in Seaford.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.041
Absolutely.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.834
I’m gonna keep in touch
with you two chaps.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.125
All right, Cedric. You ready?

21:19.083 --> 21:20.208
I’m ready.

21:20.291 --> 21:22.000
Right, then. Off we go.

21:26.041 --> 21:28.333
- Did they just...?
- Yeah.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.291
We totally should've gone with them.
