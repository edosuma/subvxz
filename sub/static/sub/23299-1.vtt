00:14.613 --> 00:16.197
Yikes!

00:18.483 --> 00:22.369
Scoob, I take back everything
I ever said about birthday clowns.

00:22.420 --> 00:25.075
Nothing's scarier than...

00:28.126 --> 00:29.777
Puppets.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.853
Like, man, why are Scoob and I running
from the monster instead of anyone else?

00:39.904 --> 00:44.025
It's pretty much default behavior
at this point. How's it comin', Fred?

00:44.076 --> 00:47.795
Almost done. Counter-weighted
pulleys, titanium weave mesh,

00:47.846 --> 00:51.299
and now, my most escape-proof trap yet.

00:51.350 --> 00:54.135
I call her "the Marionette."

00:55.386 --> 00:57.237
Incoming!

00:59.257 --> 01:01.075
It's not ready yet, Shaggy.

01:01.126 --> 01:05.045
No problem. We'll just ask
the killer puppets to take a time out.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.903
Jinkies! The world's greatest detective.

01:28.954 --> 01:31.739
Batman, what are you doing here?

01:31.790 --> 01:35.742
I go wherever puppet-related
crime rears its ugly head.

01:35.793 --> 01:37.711
Well, thanks for the assist.

01:37.762 --> 01:39.647
You should be hanging out in malt shops.

01:39.698 --> 01:41.982
Not loitering in condemned buildings.

01:42.033 --> 01:44.718
Like, Batman just told us to get a milkshake.

01:44.769 --> 01:46.253
I think we should listen.

01:46.304 --> 01:48.322
Yeah, to the malt shop.

01:48.373 --> 01:50.957
But, we're here to solve a mystery.

01:51.008 --> 01:53.794
Leave the sleuthing to
professional mystery solvers.

01:53.845 --> 01:55.395
It's not safe here for you kids.

01:55.446 --> 01:57.798
Hey, no one calls us kids.

01:57.849 --> 02:00.467
Actually, a lot of people call us kids.

02:00.518 --> 02:02.936
Most commonly paired
with the word "meddling."

02:02.987 --> 02:04.405
We are mystery solvers.

02:04.456 --> 02:06.411
And we are...

02:12.664 --> 02:16.782
This vindictive ventriloquism ends now,
you pernicious puppeteer.

02:17.735 --> 02:19.753
Zoinks! He's a ghost.

02:19.804 --> 02:22.690
Not possible.
There's always a rational explanation.

02:22.741 --> 02:25.359
Rationalize later. Trap now.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.826
Trap. Right!

02:40.992 --> 02:42.509
Oh, where's the lever?

02:42.560 --> 02:44.144
I need a light.

02:44.195 --> 02:45.715
A light.

02:56.239 --> 02:58.592
Great, you just trapped Batman.

02:58.643 --> 03:01.129
I did? Cool!

03:01.180 --> 03:04.798
Fred, think, if Batman's
in the trap, then where's...

03:08.887 --> 03:10.605
Afraid of a little fire, huh?

03:12.656 --> 03:15.242
Looks like you've met your match.

03:19.929 --> 03:21.915
Split up and head for the exit!

03:40.751 --> 03:44.937
Well, gang. It seems like we've finally
gotten to the bottom of this mystery.

03:44.988 --> 03:46.872
It all started when we got
an anonymous e-mail

03:46.923 --> 03:50.176
asking for our help
with a rash of bizarre thefts,

03:50.227 --> 03:52.312
all committed using puppets.

03:53.363 --> 03:57.116
This could only mean the abandoned
theater of Puppetto the puppeteer.

03:57.167 --> 03:59.919
Locals claim his ghost began terrorizing them

03:59.970 --> 04:02.056
when they voted to tear it down.

04:02.107 --> 04:05.992
Then I noticed Fredo using his hands
and feet to steal jewels.

04:06.043 --> 04:09.295
We also found something else
at the crime scenes.

04:09.346 --> 04:10.663
Banana peels.

04:10.714 --> 04:12.932
And Puppetto was frightened of a lit match.

04:12.983 --> 04:16.036
But the real Puppetto
was a trained fire eater.

04:16.087 --> 04:19.005
He also phased right through Batman's hand.

04:19.055 --> 04:22.379
Which can only mean that Fredo
and Puppetto are really...

04:25.430 --> 04:27.815
A monkey and a space alien?

04:27.866 --> 04:30.584
Hmm, obvious in retrospect.

04:30.635 --> 04:32.653
Not just any monkey/alien.

04:32.704 --> 04:36.023
This is the Martian Manhunter
and Detective Chimp.

04:36.074 --> 04:37.223
The superheroes?

04:37.274 --> 04:39.893
But why would two good guys
resort to stealing?

04:39.944 --> 04:42.596
For once, I have no idea.

04:42.647 --> 04:44.699
Unless...

04:48.954 --> 04:50.773
Congratulations.

04:52.824 --> 04:54.475
You passed the test.

04:54.526 --> 04:56.308
A first for me.

04:57.028 --> 04:59.178
Batman? What test?

04:59.229 --> 05:02.716
To see if you were ready
to join our organization.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.886
Bravo! Good show, and all that, what?

05:07.971 --> 05:12.858
Mystery Incorporated, welcome
to the Mystery Analysts of Gotham.

05:13.709 --> 05:16.863
The world's pre-eminent
crime busting organization.

05:16.914 --> 05:19.132
This is a lifelong dream.

05:19.183 --> 05:20.334
What made you choose us?

05:20.385 --> 05:23.202
We've been aware of your team for some time.

05:23.253 --> 05:25.038
This was your initiation.

05:25.089 --> 05:28.108
I knew something about
the crimes felt staged.

05:28.159 --> 05:29.276
Hats off, milady.

05:29.327 --> 05:32.812
Like, man, talking animals freak me out.

05:32.863 --> 05:34.881
Yeah, tell me about it.

05:34.932 --> 05:36.449
Our next meeting is in a week.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.651
In the meantime, I could use
your help on a few cases.

05:38.702 --> 05:41.488
I've made all the arrangements,
if you'll follow me.

05:41.539 --> 05:45.095
Jinkies, Batman needs our help?

07:05.890 --> 07:09.575
<i>Sayonara,</i> my masked mutton head.

07:11.361 --> 07:14.448
Not so fast, you malignant mind boggler.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.055
We've danced this dance before, Riddler.

07:23.106 --> 07:27.327
It always ends with you licking your wounds
in a padded cell at Arkham Asylum.

07:27.378 --> 07:29.728
True, you beat me one on one, Batman.

07:29.779 --> 07:33.701
But riddle me this,
when is a villain like a mathematician?

07:33.752 --> 07:36.234
Answer, when it multiplies.

07:40.457 --> 07:42.643
Did someone mention a dance?

07:42.694 --> 07:44.711
Meow.

07:47.130 --> 07:50.516
I'm gonna make a nice bat gumbo out of you.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.153
I anticipated your malevolent
mathematics, Riddler,

07:53.204 --> 07:55.521
and brought some additional allies of my own.

07:55.572 --> 07:57.757
Outrageous.

07:57.808 --> 07:59.726
Aquaman, Question.

07:59.777 --> 08:01.095
Thanks for your assistance.

08:01.146 --> 08:04.732
Could I ever refuse a call from the Batman?

08:04.783 --> 08:06.600
Crab cakes. You brought him?

08:06.651 --> 08:09.735
He's so annoying
with all those deuced questions.

08:09.786 --> 08:12.204
And how are you, Aquaman?

08:12.255 --> 08:13.639
See?

08:13.690 --> 08:16.543
Besides, he really creeps me out.

08:16.594 --> 08:17.446
Huh?

08:19.497 --> 08:22.449
Have at thee, you reptilian rapscallion.

08:34.178 --> 08:37.731
Poor thing. Must be hard to see in that mask.

08:37.881 --> 08:40.900
Let me scratch some eyes out for you.

08:43.988 --> 08:45.605
Let's wrap this up, Question.

08:45.656 --> 08:48.940
We're due at the monthly meeting
of the Mystery Analysts of Gotham.

08:49.041 --> 08:50.892
A party, eh?

08:52.195 --> 08:53.147
Huzzah!

08:53.198 --> 08:54.694
Meeting.

08:55.799 --> 08:59.219
- Not party.
- Anywhere I go is a party.

08:59.270 --> 09:03.024
A party? So there will be dancing.

09:04.075 --> 09:05.592
(GRUNTS)

09:06.643 --> 09:08.695
(GROANS)

09:08.746 --> 09:11.298
Aquaman, use your hydro-kinesis.

09:11.349 --> 09:12.532
My what-the-what?

09:12.583 --> 09:14.201
Your water controlling powers.

09:14.252 --> 09:16.238
Yes, my hydro...

09:31.102 --> 09:33.854
Safe to say, that's a wrap.

09:33.905 --> 09:35.822
Then, to the Mystery Analyst meeting.

09:35.873 --> 09:37.356
Outrageous!

09:37.407 --> 09:38.759
Let's get going.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.860
It's secret invite only, Aquaman.

09:40.911 --> 09:42.328
You're not a detective.

09:42.379 --> 09:43.764
Not a detective?

09:43.815 --> 09:47.033
Why, I'm a wiz at sleuthing
out hidden undersea currents.

09:47.084 --> 09:49.503
That's oceanography,
not criminal investigation.

09:49.554 --> 09:54.073
Plus, I can identify 900 species
of fish on sight alone.

09:54.124 --> 09:55.674
That's ichthyology.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.778
Precisely.

09:57.829 --> 10:01.881
And who's better at detecting those nasty
hard to reach volcanic fissures, eh?

10:01.932 --> 10:03.783
Me, that's who.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.118
Again, oceanography.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.690
But thanks for mopping up.

10:15.878 --> 10:17.129
Some pals.

10:17.180 --> 10:19.434
Leaving me to do all the work.

10:22.485 --> 10:25.573
Edgar, do all the work.

10:27.624 --> 10:29.341
Detectives only, eh?

10:29.392 --> 10:30.178
Hmm.

10:33.229 --> 10:37.616
<i>So, dude, there will be dinner
served at the meeting, correct?</i>

10:37.667 --> 10:41.187
You just cleaned out a truck stop
mini-mart on the way here.

10:41.238 --> 10:44.224
No, I saved one box of cookies for later.

10:45.275 --> 10:46.793
Which is now.

10:46.844 --> 10:48.662
Mmm.

10:50.881 --> 10:53.164
Like, dude, no fair.

10:54.517 --> 10:56.669
You know what's the real mystery here?

10:56.720 --> 10:57.904
Batman himself.

10:57.955 --> 10:59.807
I mean, who is he, really?

10:59.858 --> 11:02.107
Under that mask, he could be anyone.

11:02.158 --> 11:03.610
Technically, not anyone.

11:03.661 --> 11:05.946
Given Batman's observed
height and proportions,

11:05.997 --> 11:09.749
combined with the necessary financial means,
I've narrowed Gotham's ten million citizens

11:09.800 --> 11:12.418
down to a mere 6,052.

11:12.469 --> 11:14.421
Maybe you can ask him yourself.

11:14.472 --> 11:15.557
'Cause we're here.

11:18.608 --> 11:19.826
But which door is it?

11:19.877 --> 11:21.094
There are dozens.

11:21.145 --> 11:22.729
No sign of a keyhole.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.630
Or a doorknob.

11:24.681 --> 11:26.600
Wait, Fred, stop the van.

11:31.421 --> 11:33.740
Man, that is really bad haiku.

11:33.791 --> 11:36.842
Or good haiku. I can never tell.

11:36.893 --> 11:39.879
Not a poem, an anagram.

11:39.930 --> 11:41.715
Ta-da!

11:46.737 --> 11:51.490
Word jumbles, makes those long
between-mystery miles just fly by.

11:51.541 --> 11:55.148
And look, there's a gap in the bricks.

12:15.199 --> 12:18.884
Welcome, Mystery Incorporated,
to the Mystery Analysts of Gotham.

12:18.935 --> 12:21.121
In a word, jinkies.

12:23.172 --> 12:25.864
Some of our members you've already met.

12:30.915 --> 12:32.268
Are those Chocos?

12:35.369 --> 12:37.154
Um, yes.

12:37.605 --> 12:39.088
Mine.

12:47.897 --> 12:51.484
This is The Question,
our resident conspiracy theorist.

12:51.535 --> 12:54.254
Jinkies, what happened to his face?

12:54.305 --> 12:56.155
Now, that would be telling.

12:56.706 --> 12:58.057
Never mind, we're good.

12:58.108 --> 12:59.558
Uh-huh.

12:59.609 --> 13:02.227
And our expert in Meta
Human Criminology, Black...

13:02.278 --> 13:05.365
Canary. Oh, wow, I'm a huge fan.

13:05.416 --> 13:06.566
Huge fan.

13:06.617 --> 13:08.437
No autographs, Ascot.

13:11.488 --> 13:13.876
Everyone, please take a seat.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.347
Sorry.

13:20.598 --> 13:22.148
This seat's taken.

13:22.199 --> 13:23.548
See what I did there?

13:23.599 --> 13:26.620
I'm taking up the exact space of a chair.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.489
And how could we forget Plastic Man?

13:29.540 --> 13:32.629
A Martian Mindwipe would do the trick.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.030
As I was about to say,

13:38.081 --> 13:41.866
whenever any of us have a particularly
baffling mystery, we present it to the group.

13:41.917 --> 13:47.174
Speaking of mysteries, it's tradition for
new members to pick our next case to solve.

13:50.661 --> 13:52.445
A filing cabinet?

13:52.496 --> 13:54.213
Isn't that a little old school?

13:55.464 --> 13:57.984
It's our "unsolved cases" file.

13:58.035 --> 14:00.120
A drawer for each hero.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.990
That would be Plastic Man's.

14:04.041 --> 14:07.696
Yeah, I like to build up a bunch
and solve 'em all at once.

14:09.747 --> 14:13.264
Jeepers, Batman only has one unsolved case?

14:13.315 --> 14:15.134
Ruddy show-off he is.

14:15.185 --> 14:17.904
A case even Batman couldn't solve?

14:17.955 --> 14:19.238
That's...

14:19.289 --> 14:21.240
Not open for discussion.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.144
But we wanted to...

14:24.895 --> 14:27.180
I am Sir Arthur...

14:27.631 --> 14:31.484
Quirot of the Cleveland Yard.

14:32.335 --> 14:35.288
You are all under suspicion.

14:35.339 --> 14:36.855
Aquaman? What are you...

14:36.906 --> 14:39.058
I shall ask the questions here.

14:39.109 --> 14:40.659
Where is the body?

14:40.710 --> 14:41.760
Aquaman.

14:41.811 --> 14:44.496
I know one of you is the guilty party.

14:44.547 --> 14:45.831
Aquaman.

14:45.882 --> 14:48.400
And I never forget a face.

14:48.451 --> 14:51.671
Although, you seem to have forgotten yours.

14:55.092 --> 14:56.274
Just so you know,

14:56.325 --> 14:58.378
I'm rolling my eyes.

14:58.429 --> 14:59.812
Aquaman.

15:00.930 --> 15:02.081
You can stay.

15:02.132 --> 15:03.917
I can?

15:03.968 --> 15:05.085
Out...

15:05.136 --> 15:06.686
Uh...

15:06.737 --> 15:07.887
Eureka!

15:08.238 --> 15:10.756
By the hordes of H'ronmeer, a crime alert.

15:10.807 --> 15:12.957
Probably someone stealing televisions.

15:13.008 --> 15:16.062
You'd know a thing or two
about that, wouldn't you?

15:16.113 --> 15:19.906
Look again, that's a scientific storage
facility used to hold materials

15:19.986 --> 15:22.802
that are especially dangerous
or toxic in nature.

15:22.853 --> 15:24.171
That sounds serious.

15:24.222 --> 15:25.571
Maybe we should investigate.

15:25.622 --> 15:27.005
Agreed.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.075
As new members of the
Mystery Analysts of Gotham,

15:29.126 --> 15:31.878
I move that Mystery Incorporated
take the lead on this case.

15:31.929 --> 15:35.966
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

15:54.017 --> 15:56.436
<i>Batman.</i>

15:56.487 --> 15:59.339
<i>Batman.</i>

15:59.390 --> 16:01.139
Batman, everything okay?

16:01.190 --> 16:03.942
What? Oh, yes. I'm fine.

16:03.993 --> 16:08.714
Hmm. A dozen companies have used
this storage facility over the years.

16:09.967 --> 16:12.552
Sounds like whoever did it is still in here.

16:12.603 --> 16:13.755
Manhunter.

16:16.806 --> 16:17.856
Odd.

16:17.907 --> 16:20.594
I'm not sensing a living being inside.

16:21.645 --> 16:22.595
Zoinks.

16:22.646 --> 16:26.400
So, whatever is in there isn't... alive?

16:26.451 --> 16:30.068
Strange, the alarm seems
to have been tripped intentionally.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.571
As if someone wanted us to come.

16:32.622 --> 16:35.875
By Jove, this is starting
to sound intriguing.

16:35.926 --> 16:38.211
Mystery Incorporated, this is your case.

16:38.262 --> 16:39.748
How do you wanna start?

16:41.799 --> 16:43.816
Huh? Oh, right.

16:44.367 --> 16:47.453
Like we always do.
Split up and look for clues.

16:47.504 --> 16:51.524
Everyone take the one on your left.
Looks like it's you and me, doll.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.364
Okay, fine. You two search the north section.

16:57.415 --> 16:59.599
Velma, Detective Chimp, you take the south.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.101
Oh, do try and keep up, won't you?

17:02.152 --> 17:05.038
Oh, yeah? You try and keep up.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.738
Mentally, I mean.

17:06.789 --> 17:09.340
Shaggy, you're with Question
and Martian Manhunter.

17:09.392 --> 17:10.976
Search the east section.

17:11.027 --> 17:13.545
Like, sure, I'd love to search
for an undead science thief

17:13.596 --> 17:16.181
with a faceless man and a space alien.

17:19.469 --> 17:21.753
That never gets old.

17:21.805 --> 17:24.589
And Scooby, you go with Batman and Aquaman.

17:24.641 --> 17:26.892
Search the perimeter storage units.

17:26.943 --> 17:29.361
Outrageous.

17:29.412 --> 17:33.264
I'll get him to spill the bat beans
about that unsolved case yet,

17:33.315 --> 17:35.100
my canine <i>compadre.</i>

17:35.151 --> 17:37.338
Outrageous.

17:39.389 --> 17:41.274
Me and Ascot.

17:41.457 --> 17:43.042
Lovely.

17:45.962 --> 17:49.314
So, Batman, now that we're alone,

17:49.365 --> 17:52.485
confide in your old chum A-man.

17:52.536 --> 17:55.054
What's in that old file of yours?

17:55.105 --> 17:56.888
Did you lose another Robin?

17:57.539 --> 17:59.092
Just drop it, Aquaman.

18:01.143 --> 18:04.264
These devices were activated recently.

18:04.315 --> 18:06.064
Radioactivity could do that.

18:06.115 --> 18:09.268
Like, all this investigating
is making me hungry.

18:09.319 --> 18:12.304
- Now, where did I put that last Choco?
- Mine!

18:12.355 --> 18:15.808
Dude, do they have manners on your planet?

18:16.959 --> 18:19.781
No. I'll search ahead.

18:21.832 --> 18:26.052
So, Ms. Canary, what do you know
about Batman's unsolved case?

18:26.103 --> 18:27.219
Not much, Ascot.

18:27.270 --> 18:28.655
No one knows what it is.

18:28.706 --> 18:31.123
Just now, he seemed worried.

18:31.174 --> 18:33.732
Worried or guilty?

18:38.783 --> 18:41.066
Someone broke into this storage unit

18:41.117 --> 18:45.604
and it looks like several vials labelled
"Isotope 29" have been stolen.

18:45.655 --> 18:47.639
Three, to be exact.

18:47.690 --> 18:50.408
You can see the indentations clearly.

18:50.459 --> 18:52.044
Clearly, there were four.

18:52.095 --> 18:54.679
There's a ring where it was
standing alongside the others.

18:54.730 --> 18:58.517
But clearly, this was radioactive in nature.

18:58.568 --> 19:01.286
The specific chemical makeup is unknowable.

19:01.337 --> 19:04.723
And clearly, it was Isotope 29.

19:04.774 --> 19:07.459
The label ink left
a faint imprint in the tray.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.264
Reversed, of course.

19:11.315 --> 19:12.899
Ruddy show-off.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.303
Clearly.

19:19.689 --> 19:22.041
Is it me, or is it getting cold in here?

19:22.092 --> 19:25.645
So, what was that about stealing televisions?

19:25.696 --> 19:27.979
Oh, my real name is Edward O'Brian.

19:28.030 --> 19:29.314
Folks used to call me...

19:29.365 --> 19:30.849
Eel O'Brian?

19:30.900 --> 19:34.053
The most slippery thief ever
sought by the Gotham PD?

19:34.104 --> 19:35.455
You're a criminal!

19:35.506 --> 19:37.389
Correction, doll. I'm a used-to-be criminal.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.659
Ever since an accident made Eel O'Brian
the stretchiest man alive,

19:44.113 --> 19:45.497
I'm 100% hero.

19:45.548 --> 19:47.700
Are you okay?

19:47.751 --> 19:50.235
The cold messes with my stretching.

19:50.286 --> 19:51.603
You go ahead, I'll catch up.

19:51.654 --> 19:53.505
And let's keep this between us.

19:53.556 --> 19:55.341
It's kind of embarrassing.

20:00.596 --> 20:02.081
<i>Batman.</i>

20:03.132 --> 20:04.617
Something is in here.

20:04.668 --> 20:06.453
<i>Batman.</i>

20:07.504 --> 20:08.987
I can handle this alone.

20:09.038 --> 20:11.890
You should all head back to headquarters.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.393
<i>Batman.</i>

20:15.444 --> 20:17.263
You did this to me.

20:17.314 --> 20:19.966
Do you remember, Batman?

20:20.017 --> 20:21.600
Now, I'm back.

20:21.651 --> 20:24.203
Back to make you pay.

20:24.254 --> 20:27.872
You and all of Gotham.

20:27.923 --> 20:30.208
Zoinks. Like, what is that?

20:30.259 --> 20:31.643
A ghost!

20:31.694 --> 20:33.512
Who or what are you?

20:33.563 --> 20:39.385
You may call me The Crimson Cloak.

20:39.436 --> 20:40.986
Is that the thing from your case?

20:41.037 --> 20:43.255
What's this have to do
with the missing vials?

20:43.306 --> 20:44.724
Now's not the time, Canary.

20:52.414 --> 20:55.069
Have at thee, you felonious phantasm.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.370
Huh?

21:15.238 --> 21:16.856
Huh?

21:16.907 --> 21:19.158
None of you shall escape.

21:19.209 --> 21:21.026
Everybody, run!

21:35.292 --> 21:38.043
Scoob, old pal, it's been nice knowing you.

21:38.094 --> 21:39.444
Likewise.

21:51.673 --> 21:53.591
Hey, what did I miss?

21:53.642 --> 21:55.061
Yes, what's happening?

21:55.112 --> 21:57.530
Plastic Man, those barrels are combustible.

21:57.581 --> 21:59.665
- Cover us.
- I'm on it.

21:59.716 --> 22:01.199
Literally.

22:12.094 --> 22:15.148
Aquaman, Canary,
put that fire out before it spreads.

22:15.199 --> 22:18.618
Chimp and Question,
check for any innocent bystanders.

22:18.669 --> 22:22.487
- Follow my lead.
- Of course, my siren sister.

22:28.245 --> 22:29.328
What can we do to help?

22:29.379 --> 22:31.129
You and the others need
to get some place safe.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.733
Meet me at the malt shop
on the corner of Spears and Ruby.

22:33.784 --> 22:37.236
- But we were just...
- Go, I'll be in contact soon.

22:40.123 --> 22:42.041
So, what are you kids having?

22:42.092 --> 22:44.710
Like, five chocolate shakes, my good woman.

22:44.761 --> 22:47.045
What are the rest of you guys havin'?

22:48.699 --> 22:50.450
Four more, please.

22:53.202 --> 22:56.256
I've been looking for you
hippie mystery solvers.

22:57.307 --> 23:00.659
Detective Harvey Bullock, Gotham PD.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.527
What's going on, Detective?

23:02.578 --> 23:04.129
Fred Jones,

23:04.180 --> 23:07.667
I'm investigating a robbery
at Gotham Chemical Storage.

23:07.718 --> 23:09.935
Wouldn't know anything about that, would ya?

23:09.986 --> 23:12.470
Have you tried splitting up
and looking for clues?

23:12.521 --> 23:13.939
That always works for us.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.741
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it does, cupcake.

23:15.792 --> 23:17.110
Here's a clue for you.

23:17.161 --> 23:19.410
This was taken at the scene of a break-in.

23:19.461 --> 23:21.781
Whole building destroyed.

23:22.832 --> 23:24.750
Wait, who took that photo?

23:24.801 --> 23:26.452
Anonymous tipper.

23:26.503 --> 23:29.688
That's your gang's little
flower power van, ain't it?

23:29.739 --> 23:31.590
We're not a gang.

23:31.641 --> 23:34.959
Like, sure, collectively we often
refer to ourselves as "the gang."

23:35.010 --> 23:36.428
But we're not a real gang.

23:36.479 --> 23:37.729
I mean, we're a gang,

23:37.780 --> 23:39.831
but not technically a "gang" gang.

23:39.882 --> 23:42.502
And we weren't involved in that theft.

23:42.553 --> 23:43.770
Yeah?

23:43.821 --> 23:45.672
Where you been the last couple hours?

23:46.523 --> 23:47.738
Uh-oh.

23:47.789 --> 23:50.543
Uh, I'm afraid we can't tell you that.

23:50.594 --> 23:52.678
Well, ain't that convenient?

23:52.729 --> 23:56.448
We're mystery solvers,
how can you suspect us of a crime?

23:56.499 --> 23:57.983
Seen it before.

23:58.034 --> 24:02.120
Cop spends so much time thinking like
a criminal, he starts acting like one.

24:02.171 --> 24:04.290
Actually, that's a well-documented...

24:04.341 --> 24:07.959
...and completely unsound phenomenon.

24:08.010 --> 24:12.231
All right, you kids are coming
with me after I search your van.

24:12.282 --> 24:14.667
You can't do that.

24:14.718 --> 24:17.235
That'll do, Detective Bullock.

24:17.286 --> 24:19.338
I'm sure Commissioner Gordon
would be interested to hear

24:19.389 --> 24:22.407
you're arresting citizens without a warrant.

24:22.458 --> 24:26.111
Gee, I can't seem to find it.
Must've left it at the precinct.

24:26.162 --> 24:28.981
Come back when the donuts are fresh, Bullock.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.917
This ain't over, Bats.

24:31.968 --> 24:34.422
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

24:37.473 --> 24:38.591
Bet on it.

24:39.642 --> 24:41.494
What can I get you, Batman?

24:41.545 --> 24:43.796
Buttermilk over ice, please.

24:45.447 --> 24:46.698
That was close.

24:46.749 --> 24:48.633
I got here as soon as I could.

24:48.684 --> 24:51.404
The others are out working the case,
but Bullock complicates things.

24:51.455 --> 24:53.706
Batman, what happened earlier?

24:53.757 --> 24:55.475
And who is that Crimson Cloak?

24:55.526 --> 24:56.507
An old villain?

24:56.558 --> 24:57.577
A new one.

24:57.628 --> 24:59.244
I've never seen him before.

24:59.295 --> 25:00.812
Unless...

25:00.863 --> 25:02.313
What does that mean?

25:02.364 --> 25:05.016
Is he wearing a disguise
or some sort of illusion?

25:05.067 --> 25:06.225
It doesn't seem possible.

25:06.325 --> 25:10.289
I've checked and cross-checked the entire
criminal database in the Batcave computer.

25:10.340 --> 25:13.292
Batcave? As in, the actual Batcave?

25:13.343 --> 25:16.529
Jinkies! When do we get to see that?

25:16.580 --> 25:17.664
You don't.

25:18.715 --> 25:21.533
Gentleman Ghost, Clayface, Joker.

25:21.584 --> 25:23.901
Anyone who could do this
is either in Arkham Asylum

25:23.952 --> 25:25.271
or Blackgate Penitentiary.

25:25.322 --> 25:27.773
Batman, you have to tell us what happened.

25:27.824 --> 25:30.876
We're all part of the Mystery Analysts.

25:30.927 --> 25:32.878
We help each other solve cases.

25:32.929 --> 25:35.716
Yeah, it's what we Scooby-Doo.

25:38.367 --> 25:39.952
Your unsolved case.

25:40.003 --> 25:44.089
No one outside yourselves
has seen the contents of this file.

25:44.140 --> 25:47.231
It was during my first year
as a crime fighter.

25:52.282 --> 25:56.101
<i>I'd intercepted a report
of criminal activity at a secret lab.</i>

25:56.152 --> 25:58.137
<i>That malevolent mastermind Professor Milo</i>

25:58.188 --> 26:00.206
<i>had been conducting
a teleportation experiment</i>

26:00.257 --> 26:02.440
<i>that had gone horribly awry.</i>

26:02.491 --> 26:03.810
Batman?

26:03.861 --> 26:06.545
You won't thwart my experiments this time.

26:12.602 --> 26:14.553
<i>I easily subdued Professor Milo.</i>

26:14.604 --> 26:18.724
<i>But his two henchmen, Doctors Leo Scarlett
and Wade Magny, weren't so lucky.</i>

26:18.775 --> 26:20.359
It's out of control!

26:20.410 --> 26:21.592
We didn't know!

26:21.643 --> 26:24.052
Batman, help us, please!

26:33.891 --> 26:35.707
<i>I finally pulled both of them free.</i>

26:35.758 --> 26:37.075
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

26:37.126 --> 26:38.877
<i>I had saved Dr. Magny,</i>

26:38.928 --> 26:40.849
<i>but Leo Scarlett...</i>

26:49.538 --> 26:51.290
Thank you, you...

26:51.341 --> 26:52.524
You saved me.

26:53.575 --> 26:55.026
<i>It was my fault.</i>

26:55.077 --> 26:58.097
<i>He was the only innocent life I ever lost.</i>

26:58.148 --> 26:59.031
Wow.

26:59.082 --> 27:00.899
So that's your unsolved case.

27:00.950 --> 27:04.303
Sometimes, I could hear a voice in my dreams.

27:04.354 --> 27:06.371
But I never thought it was real.

27:06.422 --> 27:08.172
Now, to see what he's become...

27:08.223 --> 27:10.175
How could he be back?

27:10.226 --> 27:12.777
Because it's a real ghost.

27:12.828 --> 27:14.679
Yeah, a ghost.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.348
Don't worry, Batman.

27:16.399 --> 27:18.818
Mystery Incorporated is going
to help you solve this case.

27:18.869 --> 27:20.652
Wherever it leads.

27:20.703 --> 27:22.787
Like, where's Professor Milo?

27:22.838 --> 27:24.755
He's the most likely suspect.

27:24.806 --> 27:27.828
He met his fate in a rodent-related
incident a few years ago.

27:29.479 --> 27:30.896
Don't ask.

27:30.947 --> 27:33.466
Did Leo have any family?

27:33.517 --> 27:35.900
Only Leo's father, Sam Scarlett.

27:35.951 --> 27:38.303
A world class scientist in his own right.

27:38.354 --> 27:40.839
After the accident, he swore revenge.

27:40.890 --> 27:42.443
But he was a broken man.

27:44.094 --> 27:47.880
Wait, something just hit me.
Velma, give me your notebook.

27:49.154 --> 27:53.084
You said the other henchmen's name
was Dr. Wade Magny?

27:53.135 --> 27:56.187
But look what happens
when you rearrange the letters.

27:58.074 --> 27:59.992
How could I have missed that?

28:00.043 --> 28:01.494
Word scrambles.

28:01.545 --> 28:02.761
You know it.

28:02.812 --> 28:03.928
Amazing.

28:03.979 --> 28:05.764
Like, who's Edward Nygma?

28:05.815 --> 28:07.832
I don't know.

28:07.883 --> 28:10.703
The man who would become the most
twistedly clever criminal I've ever faced.

28:10.754 --> 28:11.736
The Riddler.

28:11.787 --> 28:13.339
The Riddler?

28:13.390 --> 28:14.706
All this time.

28:14.757 --> 28:17.543
I never realized he was involved
with Professor Milo.

28:17.594 --> 28:19.110
We have to question him.

28:19.161 --> 28:20.512
Do you know where he is?

28:20.563 --> 28:22.848
I do, but you need to stay behind.

28:22.899 --> 28:24.149
Are you kidding?

28:24.200 --> 28:26.418
We've explored tons of spooky places.

28:26.469 --> 28:29.087
You've never been any place like this.

28:41.616 --> 28:43.303
Arkham Asylum.

28:45.354 --> 28:48.974
This should be a fascinating insight
into the supervillain psyche.

28:49.025 --> 28:50.242
Like, Batman was right.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.011
We should've stayed behind.

28:52.062 --> 28:53.879
I'm man enough to admit it.

28:53.930 --> 28:55.881
I'm dog enough.

28:56.932 --> 28:58.350
Scooby.

29:03.573 --> 29:05.756
When is a dog not a dog?

29:07.142 --> 29:09.193
When it's pure bread.

29:11.948 --> 29:13.864
I've come to get answers, Riddler.

29:13.915 --> 29:16.868
I know you were working with Professor
Milo the night of the accident.

29:16.919 --> 29:18.204
Took you long enough.

29:18.255 --> 29:22.340
But before I answer your questions,
you must answer mine.

29:22.391 --> 29:25.643
When you say my name, I vanish.

29:25.694 --> 29:26.844
What am I?

29:26.895 --> 29:28.781
I got it, a coward.

29:28.832 --> 29:30.716
Let's vanish.

29:31.767 --> 29:34.151
The answer is silence.

29:34.202 --> 29:37.022
Ooh, I like this one.

29:37.073 --> 29:38.756
Silence it is.

29:38.807 --> 29:40.924
We're runnin', not screamin'.

29:42.645 --> 29:45.030
Time to break your silence, Riddler.

29:45.081 --> 29:47.166
How did you get mixed up
with Milo and Scarlett?

29:47.217 --> 29:49.168
What happened the night of the accident?

29:49.219 --> 29:53.504
Fresh out of school, I was
brilliantly evil, but too young.

29:53.555 --> 29:56.274
I hadn't figured out the whole
supervillain thing yet.

29:56.325 --> 30:00.879
So, you came up with a fake name
and joined up with Professor Milo's gang.

30:00.930 --> 30:04.983
I convinced the rather impressionable
Leo Scarlett to join up with me.

30:05.034 --> 30:06.784
But the machine wasn't ready.

30:06.835 --> 30:09.987
This was as much your doing
as it was Professor Milo's.

30:10.038 --> 30:13.693
I'm not the one who failed
to save poor Leo Scarlett.

30:14.144 --> 30:18.228
Thank you for saving me, by the way, Batman.

30:19.748 --> 30:23.636
Enough! Crimson Cloak, what is he?

30:23.687 --> 30:25.536
Perhaps he's fate.

30:25.587 --> 30:29.241
You failed to save Leo's life,
now he's come for yours.

30:29.292 --> 30:31.476
So, I leave you with a final riddle.

30:31.527 --> 30:35.014
What's black, white and red all over?

30:35.065 --> 30:37.983
Everyone knows that. A newspaper.

30:38.034 --> 30:40.518
Wrong! The answer, dear Batman,

30:40.569 --> 30:43.121
is the last thing you will ever see.

30:43.172 --> 30:47.224
The black of his shadow, his white-hot fury,

30:47.275 --> 30:52.050
and a descending red shroud of your doom.

30:53.281 --> 30:55.434
This is a dead end.

30:55.485 --> 30:57.468
Lest you think me a complete monster,

30:57.519 --> 31:00.305
you'll find his remains,
the sleeve of his lab coat,

31:00.356 --> 31:02.474
laid to rest at Arkham Cemetery.

31:02.525 --> 31:05.577
On the grounds of this very asylum.

31:05.628 --> 31:07.412
Let's go.

31:20.343 --> 31:23.264
Like, who knew Arkham had a cafeteria?

31:25.315 --> 31:29.634
Bates burger, Hanni-bowl, Pasta Al Capone.

31:29.685 --> 31:32.537
Sounds scary, but it sure looks delicious.

31:33.088 --> 31:35.106
What do you say, Scoob?

31:36.051 --> 31:38.010
Let's seek asylum.

31:38.861 --> 31:42.313
Shaggy! Scooby-Doo!

31:42.364 --> 31:44.014
Where are you?

31:44.065 --> 31:46.918
Sorry, Batman, they run off sometimes.

31:46.969 --> 31:48.719
A lot, actually.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.656
Okay, every single time.

31:50.707 --> 31:52.925
Flight is a natural response to the unknown.

31:52.976 --> 31:54.091
We'll find them.

31:54.142 --> 31:56.830
<i>Batman!</i>

31:58.881 --> 32:01.667
Leaving so soon, Batman?

32:01.718 --> 32:03.334
Jeepers! It's the ghost!

32:03.385 --> 32:05.970
What do you want,
you pestiferous poltergeist?

32:06.021 --> 32:09.141
Why, your demise, of course.

32:11.193 --> 32:13.378
How fitting it should happen here,

32:13.429 --> 32:16.649
among all your enemies.

32:20.002 --> 32:21.352
He's turned off the power.

32:21.403 --> 32:23.989
But the cell doors
are electronically operated.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.895
That means...

32:37.886 --> 32:40.405
Batman, what was that you said about running?

32:40.456 --> 32:44.610
- It's a natural response.
- Yeah, that. Run!

32:58.940 --> 33:03.593
You may have to be crazy to get in here,
but you'd be even crazier to leave.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.937
Ooh, that's a lot of puddin', puddin'.

33:14.557 --> 33:18.710
You weren't going to eat
that salad, were you?

33:18.761 --> 33:23.617
Ivy gets real upset
when folks ain't nice to plants!

33:24.668 --> 33:26.150
This?

33:26.201 --> 33:28.085
Garnish. Purely decorative.

33:28.136 --> 33:31.824
We'll just put it back
for the next evil mastermind to enjoy.

33:34.045 --> 33:37.262
Zoinks! Like, man, where did that come from?

33:37.313 --> 33:40.197
Beats me. Beats you too.

34:13.281 --> 34:16.237
Oh, so it's like that, is it?

34:18.288 --> 34:19.774
Food fight!

34:24.259 --> 34:26.080
Get them, Georgia.

34:29.130 --> 34:30.382
Like, we're pinned down.

34:30.433 --> 34:32.351
We'll have to eat our way out of here!

34:32.402 --> 34:34.018
Let's roll!

34:47.417 --> 34:49.534
Shagg, Scoob.

34:49.585 --> 34:51.368
Like, the villains are all out.

34:51.418 --> 34:53.237
We know, they're right behind us.

34:53.288 --> 34:55.440
We can't let them escape into the city.

34:55.491 --> 34:56.873
Everyone out, quickly!

34:56.925 --> 34:58.839
You don't have to tell us twice.

35:56.951 --> 35:59.908
We need to seal off the outer exit
before they get out.

36:07.964 --> 36:09.547
Oh, that was close.

36:09.598 --> 36:12.784
If those criminals had escaped,
it would have been a disaster.

36:12.835 --> 36:15.920
Man, the real disaster
is all that food going to waste.

36:15.971 --> 36:18.522
Yeah, I wanted seconds.

36:18.623 --> 36:22.327
- Guys, look.
- Arkham Cemetery.

36:36.341 --> 36:39.280
This must be the place
Riddler was talking about.

36:42.531 --> 36:43.748
Like, I have a plan.

36:43.799 --> 36:46.955
How about we don't open the spooky crypt?

36:53.209 --> 36:54.966
Zoinks! A ghost!

37:02.817 --> 37:05.203
No. It's another dead end.

37:05.254 --> 37:07.138
- Scooby.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:13.428 --> 37:15.348
Like, Scooby-Doo found something.

37:16.399 --> 37:18.083
A footprint.

37:18.134 --> 37:19.924
Good work, Scooby.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.859
Someone opened the hatch.

37:28.910 --> 37:31.598
Like, that someone is still there.

37:34.232 --> 37:37.021
Guys, it's just Detective Bullock.

37:39.622 --> 37:42.739
Hey, you can't search our van
without a warrant.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.476
This time I brung one.

37:45.527 --> 37:47.679
And that ain't all, hippies.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.982
The Mystery Analysts of Gotham.

37:51.033 --> 37:54.453
I may not be you super freaks' biggest fan,

37:54.504 --> 37:58.190
but I thought you'd want to know
about one of your own goin' bad.

37:58.441 --> 38:01.759
Batman and his mystery pals
let out half the inmates.

38:01.810 --> 38:04.563
Inciting a riot? Is this true?

38:04.614 --> 38:07.132
We didn't do that. It was the ghost.

38:07.183 --> 38:09.234
Oh, ghost. Right.

38:09.285 --> 38:13.576
I was just about to search
their van, but be my guest.

38:17.727 --> 38:19.979
The stolen Isotope 29?

38:20.230 --> 38:22.080
Hmm. Curious.

38:22.131 --> 38:26.116
You said a mouthful, if you had a mouth.

38:26.167 --> 38:29.554
Those were not in our van.
Someone put them there.

38:29.605 --> 38:32.824
Detective Bullock, I personally
vouch for Mystery Incorporated.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.460
We're working together.

38:34.511 --> 38:36.828
Then I'll take that as an admission.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.596
There is an explanation for this.

38:38.647 --> 38:41.833
I'm sure there is,
but there are procedures to follow.

38:41.884 --> 38:44.435
And right now,
you and the gang are prime suspects.

38:44.486 --> 38:48.473
And you have been acting
a bit off of late, old chap.

38:48.524 --> 38:51.977
Arrest them all, including the Bat!

38:52.028 --> 38:55.179
As a former crook,
I have to admit this does look bad.

38:55.230 --> 38:56.614
We haven't done anything.

38:56.665 --> 38:58.216
We were framed.

38:58.267 --> 39:01.953
Come along quietly.
Don't try anything stupid.

39:02.004 --> 39:03.455
Like this?

39:07.810 --> 39:10.098
- To the Batmobile?
- No time.

39:14.149 --> 39:15.266
Drive!

39:15.317 --> 39:18.440
You heard the man. Paw to the metal!

39:25.027 --> 39:27.446
Oh, groovy.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.951
The guilty always run.

39:34.002 --> 39:36.154
Detective, we'll bring them in.

39:46.716 --> 39:51.170
We've been chased by a lot
of things, but never superheroes.

39:56.358 --> 39:59.114
Whoever is at the wheel
is driving like a madman.

40:06.768 --> 40:10.221
Indeed. They need to be stopped
before someone gets injured.

40:10.272 --> 40:12.776
Let me show 'em the proper hand signals.

40:14.477 --> 40:17.595
- Scooby, turn left!
- Left. Copy.

40:17.846 --> 40:19.598
He doesn't know directions.

40:19.649 --> 40:21.701
Duh. He's a dog.

40:24.419 --> 40:25.739
Yeah!

40:39.167 --> 40:42.891
- Where are we going?
- They call it No Man's Land.

40:58.488 --> 41:02.039
You kids make a run for it.
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

41:02.890 --> 41:04.910
Scoob and I got this.

41:10.366 --> 41:12.118
Dudes, where you've been?

41:14.109 --> 41:18.421
We throw this killer tailgate party
and you guys are just showing up now?

41:18.472 --> 41:20.625
Like, game starts in five minutes.

41:21.676 --> 41:23.962
Hmm. Not cool.

41:25.346 --> 41:28.567
Here, down these quick.
Can't bring food in the stadium.

41:30.618 --> 41:31.768
Hey!

41:31.819 --> 41:34.705
What are you doing?
No one puts ketchup on a hot dog.

41:34.756 --> 41:36.575
Mustard and relish only.

41:37.326 --> 41:38.743
Like this.

41:44.098 --> 41:46.817
There's no possible way
that should have worked.

41:46.868 --> 41:48.853
Just go with it.

42:09.457 --> 42:11.877
Here's to crime.

42:19.568 --> 42:23.187
What? Hippies have invaded
our sacred sanctorum!

42:23.238 --> 42:26.661
And the Caped Crusader was at the wheel!

42:33.714 --> 42:36.366
Come on, you nefarious nobodies,

42:36.417 --> 42:40.237
let us A-listers show you
how to skin a bat!

42:51.432 --> 42:55.286
Is there room in this wacky race
for the mountebank of menace?

42:55.337 --> 42:57.289
Is that the Joker?

42:58.640 --> 43:00.257
And Penguin.

43:16.993 --> 43:18.409
What?

43:56.431 --> 43:57.915
This is insane.

43:57.966 --> 44:02.386
We can't outrun superpowered heroes
and villains in the Mystery Machine!

44:02.437 --> 44:04.059
We won't have to.

44:19.154 --> 44:21.774
Get in the car, I'll cover you.

44:34.937 --> 44:36.054
Like, he wants us to jump?

44:36.105 --> 44:37.554
From a moving car?

44:37.605 --> 44:39.391
Into a moving car?

44:42.143 --> 44:44.828
Oh, that was fun.

44:44.879 --> 44:46.665
Come on, gang!

45:22.016 --> 45:25.034
We lose more Mystery Machines that way.

45:34.430 --> 45:38.049
Stop this, Batman,
before you go down in flames.

45:38.100 --> 45:39.855
You first.

45:43.906 --> 45:45.223
Mine.

45:48.509 --> 45:49.196
Hmm.

45:53.247 --> 45:55.766
Sorry, Bats, end of the line.

46:11.699 --> 46:15.153
Curses, the batwinged boob and those beatniks

46:15.204 --> 46:17.321
have blown the belfry.

46:18.072 --> 46:21.937
But as car chases go, it was a gas.

46:23.011 --> 46:26.063
Ugh. I need new friends.

46:26.114 --> 46:28.076
Well, look what we have here.

46:29.417 --> 46:30.667
Woopsie.

46:30.718 --> 46:33.403
New plan. Let's bash some bad guys.

46:33.454 --> 46:34.814
I'm down.

46:43.265 --> 46:46.117
Sorry for the tight squeeze.
We're almost there.

46:46.168 --> 46:50.187
It's all good, except for
the Batarang I think I'm sitting on.

46:50.438 --> 46:53.258
Try not to shift your weight, then.
Could be an exploding one.

46:55.310 --> 46:56.860
Where are we headed, Batman?

46:56.911 --> 46:59.563
Someplace you can lie low
until we can clear your names.

46:59.614 --> 47:03.967
And yours. By helping us,
you've become a fugitive as well.

47:04.018 --> 47:05.982
It wouldn't be the first time.

47:18.033 --> 47:21.518
Jinkies! We're in the Batcave.

47:21.569 --> 47:24.554
As in the actual Batcave?

47:24.605 --> 47:28.594
Based on the bat guano
I just stepped in, I'd say yes.

47:30.645 --> 47:31.730
Ooh...

47:32.781 --> 47:34.199
Better.

47:36.886 --> 47:38.370
Oops.

47:39.721 --> 47:43.373
I have some investigating to do.
Please, make yourself at home.

47:43.424 --> 47:47.311
Like, it definitely has
the whole cave thing going for it.

47:47.362 --> 47:51.414
But the giant penny and Dino
don't exactly scream Bat.

47:51.465 --> 47:52.917
Those do.

47:52.968 --> 47:55.252
Wow! Batman's first uniform.

47:55.303 --> 47:56.821
And Robin, the Boy Wonder.

47:56.872 --> 47:59.322
Batgirl's got the cutest cape ever.

47:59.473 --> 48:02.659
Like, those flashy threads
can only be Nightwing's.

48:03.210 --> 48:06.029
Look, Scoob, who knew Batman had a dog?

48:06.280 --> 48:07.931
I did.

48:08.682 --> 48:12.737
That's Ace the Bat-Hound.
These are all of Batman's sidekicks.

48:12.788 --> 48:14.038
Former sidekicks.

48:17.091 --> 48:18.775
That one, the press report.

48:18.826 --> 48:20.743
<i>Detective Bullock you can't actually believe</i>

48:20.794 --> 48:23.380
<i>Mystery Incorporated is behind these crimes?</i>

48:23.431 --> 48:26.583
<i>This all started right after
they arrived in Gotham.</i>

48:26.634 --> 48:29.487
<i>And this time, we got it all on camera.</i>

48:34.375 --> 48:39.964
<i>Norville Rogers, better known
by his gang call sign, Shaggy.</i>

48:40.015 --> 48:41.732
Shaggy?

48:42.083 --> 48:43.301
<i>There you have it, folks.</i>

48:43.352 --> 48:46.536
<i>Undeniable proof that Mystery
Incorporated is guilty of...</i>

48:46.587 --> 48:48.605
Really has his trademark slouch.

48:48.656 --> 48:51.007
And his toothpick arms.

48:51.058 --> 48:53.745
And his soulless, beady eyes.

48:53.796 --> 48:56.915
Like, okay. We get the picture.

48:56.966 --> 48:58.482
But it's not me.

48:58.533 --> 49:02.821
Of course not. There is
no possible way that's Shaggy.

49:02.872 --> 49:05.822
He walked right past a box of donuts.

49:05.873 --> 49:08.960
You don't suppose Detective Bullock
and his men could be...

49:09.011 --> 49:10.594
No. Stay here.

49:10.645 --> 49:12.897
It's too dangerous for you kids
to be out on the street.

49:12.948 --> 49:14.098
Where are you going?

49:14.149 --> 49:16.134
Back to where this all started.

49:16.185 --> 49:17.601
Milo's lab.

49:17.652 --> 49:20.004
Something about that event
still doesn't add up.

49:20.055 --> 49:24.842
You mean, we have to stay holed up
in this cave without sustenance?

49:24.893 --> 49:27.578
Or anything to eat?

49:27.629 --> 49:30.080
There's a supply of food in...

49:30.131 --> 49:32.650
Ah, the Bat dehydrator.

49:38.906 --> 49:40.257
It's been shrunk.

49:40.308 --> 49:43.661
What horrific device could do this to food?

49:43.712 --> 49:46.397
It's evil. Evil, I tell you.

49:46.448 --> 49:49.571
It allows me to eat
high-caloric meals on the go.

49:55.769 --> 49:57.607
It's like eating a full course meal.

49:57.658 --> 50:01.614
In one moisture-free bite.

50:04.665 --> 50:09.255
Ugh, I've never eaten
so little and felt so full.

50:12.306 --> 50:15.759
Oh, instant gluttony.

50:20.814 --> 50:23.300
But Batman, we wanna help.

50:23.951 --> 50:27.303
This mud isn't native to the area.
Find out where it came from.

50:27.354 --> 50:30.775
You're letting me use the Batlab?

50:31.226 --> 50:35.229
Of course. We are partners, after all.

50:37.732 --> 50:39.433
Jinkies.

51:02.723 --> 51:05.609
Indulging in a bit of Bat sleuthery, are we?

51:05.660 --> 51:07.678
Aquaman, not a good time.

51:07.729 --> 51:11.683
But I heard about all the trouble
you and your hippy sidekicks are in.

51:11.734 --> 51:12.850
I want to help.

51:12.901 --> 51:14.786
They're not hippies, and you're not...

51:14.837 --> 51:18.455
Not a detective, I know, by Neptune.

51:18.506 --> 51:22.493
I'm here to lend my fists, not my wits.

51:23.744 --> 51:25.976
Fine. But follow my lead.

51:26.027 --> 51:28.483
Outrageous! I shall call this,

51:28.563 --> 51:33.108
"The time I helped Batman defend
a gang of juvenile delinquents."

51:38.259 --> 51:41.344
<i>Batman.</i>

51:41.395 --> 51:43.112
Are you okay, Batman?

51:43.163 --> 51:45.149
Did you hear a voice?

51:45.200 --> 51:46.549
Sorry, old chum.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.719
My hearing's as sharp as a swordfish, but...

51:51.138 --> 51:52.826
I heard that.

51:55.177 --> 51:57.193
Question, what are you doing here?

51:57.244 --> 51:58.962
Following the threads, same as you.

51:59.013 --> 52:01.966
They all lead here, but it's a dead end.

52:02.017 --> 52:04.868
It can't be. It's the only way
to clear Mystery Incorporated.

52:04.919 --> 52:08.304
The gang isn't behind this, I'm sure of that.

52:08.355 --> 52:12.743
Well, look who's finally learned
to have a little faith.

52:12.794 --> 52:16.080
And for a change, you're not ending
every sentence with a question.

52:16.131 --> 52:18.681
I can't tell you how annoying that was.

52:18.732 --> 52:21.551
Pull it in for a hug, my blank-faced buddy.

52:21.602 --> 52:22.786
Ugh.

52:22.837 --> 52:26.824
Guess I picked up a few bad habits
working with you and Batman.

52:26.875 --> 52:30.259
Why, you've even developed a sense of humor.

52:30.310 --> 52:31.562
Of sorts.

52:31.613 --> 52:33.563
This is a night for rejoicing.

52:33.614 --> 52:35.165
That'll have to wait, Aquaman.

52:35.216 --> 52:37.101
There's evil afoot.

52:37.452 --> 52:41.171
Crimson Cloak has rebuilt
Milo's teleportation machine.

52:43.757 --> 52:46.377
Welcome, Dark Knight.

52:46.428 --> 52:48.978
Okay, that is scary. Can't be real.

52:49.029 --> 52:51.748
It isn't. But I suspect I know who it is.

52:51.799 --> 52:54.451
Leo Scarlett's father, Sam.

52:54.502 --> 52:56.219
Give yourself up, Mr. Scarlett.

52:56.270 --> 52:58.321
This won't bring Leo back.

52:58.372 --> 53:00.991
Let me help you, please.

53:01.042 --> 53:04.460
That name means nothing to the Crimson Cloak.

53:04.511 --> 53:06.330
Then what is it you want?

53:06.381 --> 53:09.199
Why, you, of course, Batman.

53:28.803 --> 53:30.259
Batman! Aquaman!

53:37.310 --> 53:38.728
Question! No!

53:38.779 --> 53:41.699
Don't worry about him, Dark Knight.

53:41.750 --> 53:44.107
Fear for yourself.

53:51.408 --> 53:54.920
Now to see if I can identify
the soil from this footprint.

54:03.671 --> 54:05.688
Oh, okay, that was weird.

54:05.739 --> 54:08.025
Guys, something strange...

54:08.676 --> 54:10.194
is going on.

54:12.013 --> 54:14.232
Jeepers! The mud's alive!

54:14.783 --> 54:16.600
But how?

54:25.775 --> 54:28.612
So, like, we're in a battle
with possessed dirt.

54:28.663 --> 54:31.281
Clearly, the chemicals in the stolen
isotope spilled into the ground,

54:31.332 --> 54:34.518
resulting in stimulation of the silicon
particles which... Ah, who am I kidding?

54:34.569 --> 54:36.553
There's no rational explanation for this.

54:42.810 --> 54:45.062
It must be linked with the case somehow.

54:45.113 --> 54:46.630
You think?

54:51.185 --> 54:53.337
We need Batman.

54:53.388 --> 54:56.444
<i>Batman.</i>

55:01.495 --> 55:03.451
Huh?

55:07.502 --> 55:09.652
Awaken, Batman.

55:09.903 --> 55:13.890
You wouldn't want to miss
the final moments of your life.

55:14.441 --> 55:16.560
Leo, listen to me. I...

55:16.611 --> 55:18.278
Leo is gone.

55:18.329 --> 55:20.846
There is only The Crimson Cloak.

55:22.884 --> 55:25.469
I'm sorry. Let me help you.

55:25.520 --> 55:28.739
Too late. You didn't save me.

55:28.790 --> 55:31.776
And no one will save you.

55:31.827 --> 55:36.980
Behold! I have repaired what you destroyed.

55:49.310 --> 55:53.362
Suffering sand dollars! I know
you're a ghost, but pull yourself together.

55:53.413 --> 55:55.232
Great Scott, that's it!

55:55.283 --> 55:57.234
How could I have not known?

56:01.355 --> 56:03.239
Fred. Plan.

56:03.290 --> 56:04.373
Okay, okay.

56:04.424 --> 56:06.375
Shagg, Scoob, you're...

56:06.426 --> 56:08.980
The bait? Shocker.

56:10.031 --> 56:11.248
Hmm.

56:26.848 --> 56:29.065
Turn the dehydrator on.

56:39.194 --> 56:40.543
It's only dust.

56:40.594 --> 56:43.915
This is all starting to make sense now.

56:44.966 --> 56:48.586
There's only one villain
who could be responsible.

56:49.337 --> 56:50.487
Watch this.

56:51.538 --> 56:53.856
- No way!
- I don't believe it.

56:53.907 --> 56:56.192
Believe it! We've got to warn Batman!

56:57.343 --> 56:58.663
Batman.

57:01.616 --> 57:04.335
He's been captured. We have to help.

57:04.386 --> 57:09.174
How? We're wanted by every police officer,
villain, and superhero in Gotham.

57:09.305 --> 57:10.806
Yeah.

57:10.725 --> 57:13.143
- Hmm.
- What is it, Fred?

57:13.194 --> 57:14.310
Plan B.

57:14.361 --> 57:16.281
And "B" is for "Bat."

57:17.332 --> 57:19.051
Groovy.

57:21.102 --> 57:23.319
Aquaman, keep him distracted.

57:23.370 --> 57:25.321
Will do, old chum.

57:25.372 --> 57:29.493
I'll masterfully misdirect
that malevolent miscreant.

57:29.544 --> 57:31.495
Hey there, buddy.

57:31.546 --> 57:33.864
Let's not be too hasty with those buttons.

57:33.915 --> 57:37.734
After all, theft is one thing, but this...

57:37.785 --> 57:40.536
No loose ends.

57:40.587 --> 57:42.540
Ah, yes, loose ends.

57:42.591 --> 57:46.310
That reminds me of the time Mera
made her famous squid entrail casserole.

57:46.361 --> 57:49.980
Oh, unfortunately,
the squid had gone bad and...

57:50.031 --> 57:53.620
Uh-uh-uh. No tricks, Dark Knight.

57:57.805 --> 58:00.891
And now, dear Batman,

58:00.942 --> 58:04.161
it's your turn to be scattered everywhere.

58:15.857 --> 58:19.708
So ends the world's greatest detective.

58:25.632 --> 58:27.451
And what's left of Gotham City

58:27.502 --> 58:31.757
will be the criminal underworld's
to do with as it pleases.

58:34.442 --> 58:35.692
What?

58:35.743 --> 58:39.603
Desist with this depraved disintegration,
you diabolical despot.

58:47.654 --> 58:50.373
The Bat Gang has arrived.

58:50.424 --> 58:54.746
Prepare to face the hammers of justice!

58:57.797 --> 59:00.524
Like, um, what's next?

59:16.218 --> 59:17.333
Outrageous!

59:17.384 --> 59:20.038
Now, that's what I call an entrance.

59:20.689 --> 59:23.147
More distractions!

59:30.198 --> 59:32.583
Jeepers! He's turned into Bat villains.

59:32.634 --> 59:34.254
What do we do?

59:37.305 --> 59:38.656
Run!

01:00:43.303 --> 01:00:46.489
Like, isn't someone supposed to say
"holy something" about now?

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.529
Oh, um... Holy surrounded by Bat villains!

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:52.962
Mmm. Not quite.

01:00:53.013 --> 01:00:56.000
Try... Holy Custer's Last Stand, Batman!

01:00:56.051 --> 01:00:57.942
How are you so good at this?

01:00:58.273 --> 01:00:59.540
Now!

01:01:05.593 --> 01:01:09.815
- Huh?
- Have a taste of the Bat dehydrator.

01:01:30.652 --> 01:01:33.036
There we go. Good job, guys.

01:01:33.287 --> 01:01:35.475
Make sure you get every grain.

01:01:38.826 --> 01:01:40.543
Looks like we missed the party.

01:01:40.594 --> 01:01:43.311
We all did.

01:01:43.362 --> 01:01:46.984
Took me a while to dig myself out
from under all that rubble.

01:01:48.035 --> 01:01:50.386
Now, for the unmasking...

01:01:50.437 --> 01:01:53.056
Only there's no mask to pull off this time.

01:01:53.107 --> 01:01:55.426
Allow me.

01:01:55.477 --> 01:02:01.397
Observe, The Crimson Cloak
is actually Clayface.

01:02:01.448 --> 01:02:04.134
His real name is Basil Karlo,

01:02:04.185 --> 01:02:07.002
an actor who was transformed into living clay

01:02:07.053 --> 01:02:09.739
and can mold himself into anything.

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.074
Or anyone.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:14.076
That's why my telepathy didn't pick him up.

01:02:14.127 --> 01:02:16.346
But for what motive?

01:02:16.397 --> 01:02:18.848
I picked up a corrosive bacteria strain.

01:02:18.899 --> 01:02:22.553
My body was breaking down,
getting harder to maintain my shape.

01:02:22.604 --> 01:02:25.888
It was easier to split into several parts.

01:02:25.939 --> 01:02:28.058
Been there, done that.

01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:31.627
But how could a teleportation machine help?

01:02:31.678 --> 01:02:33.096
I was offered a cure.

01:02:33.147 --> 01:02:35.297
Just another acting role, I guess.

01:02:35.348 --> 01:02:40.469
All I had to do was help him by stealing
the isotopes and framing you kids.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.471
Help who?

01:02:41.522 --> 01:02:44.040
The real culprit behind this entire plot.

01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:45.808
The Riddler.

01:02:45.859 --> 01:02:48.277
The Riddler?

01:02:48.328 --> 01:02:51.882
Once he had the machine,
he would hand over a cure.

01:02:51.933 --> 01:02:54.484
I suppose he was just acting, too.

01:02:54.535 --> 01:02:58.388
All right. Guess you kids
ain't guilty of anything.

01:02:58.439 --> 01:03:02.191
Except maybe bad taste in fashion.

01:03:02.242 --> 01:03:05.897
Okay, let's get this ball
of mud back to Blackgate.

01:03:07.448 --> 01:03:09.866
I almost feel sorry for him.

01:03:10.617 --> 01:03:15.005
He'll be fully rehydrated, once he's
securely back behind prison walls.

01:03:15.056 --> 01:03:18.942
Now, see here, old chap,
how could Riddler have orchestrated

01:03:18.993 --> 01:03:22.078
so complex a plan from Akhram?

01:03:22.129 --> 01:03:24.714
Because The Riddler was never at Arkham.

01:03:24.765 --> 01:03:25.915
Jinkies!

01:03:25.966 --> 01:03:28.518
Wow! I don't understand.

01:03:28.569 --> 01:03:29.351
Outrageous!

01:03:29.402 --> 01:03:31.721
Okay, I'm completely confused.

01:03:31.772 --> 01:03:33.860
Zoinks!

01:03:37.911 --> 01:03:39.062
Batman to Arkham.

01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:40.863
Arkham here, Batman.

01:03:40.914 --> 01:03:43.967
<i>Check inmate in cell DC-140.</i>

01:03:45.018 --> 01:03:47.136
The Riddler is still in his cell.

01:03:47.187 --> 01:03:49.047
Check again.

01:03:57.098 --> 01:03:59.248
What? Arkham to Batman.

01:03:59.299 --> 01:04:00.951
It's not The Riddler. It's...

01:04:01.002 --> 01:04:03.620
Another Clayface decoy.

01:04:03.671 --> 01:04:05.254
Then where is he?

01:04:05.305 --> 01:04:06.558
Closer than you think.

01:04:08.609 --> 01:04:11.795
I believe you kids are owed a true unmasking.

01:04:12.846 --> 01:04:14.199
The Riddler?

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:18.368
Okay, now this is getting redundant.

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:21.971
Incredible! How long was he
posing as The Question?

01:04:22.022 --> 01:04:24.085
Ever since our fight at the bank.

01:04:35.136 --> 01:04:37.554
So Clayface pretended to be The Riddler.

01:04:37.605 --> 01:04:40.757
Giving The Riddler the chance
to ambush The Question.

01:04:40.808 --> 01:04:42.525
A perfect shell game.

01:04:42.576 --> 01:04:45.994
Blazes! How did you suss that out, good man?

01:04:46.045 --> 01:04:48.900
I didn't. I was too distracted
by The Crimson Cloak

01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:51.703
and my own sense of failure.

01:04:53.754 --> 01:04:58.474
It was Aquaman's keen observational skill
that noticed Question's changed demeanor.

01:04:58.525 --> 01:05:02.979
What the what? Oh! Right.
Yes, of course, old chum.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:06.882
Don't mention it.
We detectives have to stick together.

01:05:09.669 --> 01:05:13.522
Like, it feels weird that we didn't solve
the crime or do the wrap-up, even.

01:05:13.573 --> 01:05:16.393
Yeah, maybe you were right
to begin with, Batman.

01:05:16.444 --> 01:05:18.328
We aren't ready for the big leagues.

01:05:18.379 --> 01:05:21.764
Actually, you've more than earned
your place on the Mystery Analysts team.

01:05:21.815 --> 01:05:24.435
I wouldn't have reopened
or solved this case at all

01:05:24.486 --> 01:05:26.737
if it weren't for you meddling kids.

01:05:28.788 --> 01:05:32.375
Okay, Riddler, it's time to get you
back to your cell at Arkham.

01:05:32.426 --> 01:05:35.379
And to think, I almost got away with...

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:39.415
Oh, wait. I did get away with it.

01:05:39.466 --> 01:05:40.984
What are you talking about?

01:05:41.035 --> 01:05:42.786
One last riddle.

01:05:42.837 --> 01:05:47.457
How is this moment like
the end of a boxing match?

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:50.627
Because the gloves are off!

01:05:58.752 --> 01:05:59.705
After him!

01:06:01.756 --> 01:06:04.139
End of the line, you warped wordsmith.

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.442
You and your goons are outnumbered.

01:06:06.993 --> 01:06:09.112
This game has just begun.

01:06:09.163 --> 01:06:13.551
You should know that the answer
to every riddle is an even bigger one.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:38.275
With this device, I can riddle
your precious city into oblivion.

01:06:38.326 --> 01:06:41.410
It can vaporize entire sections of Gotham.

01:06:41.461 --> 01:06:44.420
I need only pick a target,
press a button, and zap!

01:06:44.551 --> 01:06:47.383
It vanishes forever.

01:06:53.306 --> 01:06:54.626
First up...

01:06:56.377 --> 01:06:59.630
Say goodbye to City Hall.

01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:01.797
- Riddle me this.
- What?

01:07:01.848 --> 01:07:03.766
What just hit you?

01:07:07.354 --> 01:07:10.877
Answer? The Question.

01:07:24.672 --> 01:07:26.624
Question, lower the shield!

01:07:29.675 --> 01:07:31.431
It's not working.

01:07:35.482 --> 01:07:37.601
Ah, we need to shut it down.

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:40.036
I'm afraid it's on a chain reaction.

01:07:40.087 --> 01:07:41.571
It cannot be stopped.

01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:43.774
Batman, you'll have to destroy it!

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:47.978
<i>Batman.</i>

01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:51.947
That voice. How can I still be hearing it?

01:07:51.998 --> 01:07:53.417
I don't hear anything.

01:07:53.468 --> 01:07:55.217
Me neither.

01:07:55.268 --> 01:07:58.020
- I heard it.
- You did?

01:07:58.071 --> 01:07:59.223
And see it.

01:08:01.274 --> 01:08:02.558
Bangers and mash!

01:08:02.609 --> 01:08:04.828
It looks like a man.

01:08:04.879 --> 01:08:07.234
I know who it is.
We need to reverse the polarity.

01:08:12.285 --> 01:08:14.571
Impossible! It's too late, Batman.

01:08:14.622 --> 01:08:17.173
It's not impossible. I can help.

01:08:17.224 --> 01:08:21.678
Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, Detective Chimp,
flip every other relay to reverse phasing.

01:08:24.732 --> 01:08:26.883
I just want to say this really tingles.

01:08:26.934 --> 01:08:28.225
And not in a good way.

01:08:41.549 --> 01:08:43.169
<i>Batman.</i>

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:48.408
Can't get leverage.

01:08:54.862 --> 01:08:55.912
Slipping.

01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:10.292
Hurry! It's about to overload!

01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:30.946
Batman?

01:09:39.607 --> 01:09:41.792
I'm... alive?

01:09:41.843 --> 01:09:44.932
Leo Scarlett. Welcome home.

01:09:51.385 --> 01:09:55.471
Your first encounter with the machine put you
in tune with the teleporter's frequency.

01:09:55.522 --> 01:09:59.308
But only when you were near
the isotopes used in the original device.

01:09:59.359 --> 01:10:02.678
That's why I kept hearing him
at the crime scenes.

01:10:02.729 --> 01:10:04.179
There you are.

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:05.581
Professor Scarlett.

01:10:05.632 --> 01:10:08.853
Thank you, Caped Crusader, for saving my son.

01:10:10.904 --> 01:10:15.561
I can't give you back the years you've lost,
but I'm sure you have many more ahead.

01:10:19.612 --> 01:10:24.100
So, Bats, how does it feel
to have your unsolved case solved?

01:10:24.151 --> 01:10:26.770
It feels... good.

01:10:26.821 --> 01:10:28.737
But I couldn't have done it
without my friends.

01:10:28.788 --> 01:10:31.106
Especially Scooby and the gang.

01:10:31.157 --> 01:10:35.645
You realize that leaves him
with a clean slate of solved cases, right?

01:10:35.696 --> 01:10:37.513
Overachiever.

01:10:37.564 --> 01:10:39.481
There'll be no living with him now.

01:10:39.532 --> 01:10:41.755
As if there was before.

01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:49.258
Mystery Incorporated,
you filled those suits well.

01:10:49.309 --> 01:10:51.312
Aw, shucks.

01:10:52.513 --> 01:10:55.464
Ah, finally, we can relax.

01:10:55.515 --> 01:10:56.967
Nope, afraid not.

01:10:57.018 --> 01:10:59.535
Tonight is our last night in Gotham.

01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:03.906
Then until our next adventure.

01:11:03.957 --> 01:11:06.744
It's been an honor, Mystery Incorporated.

01:11:09.195 --> 01:11:13.350
Actually, there's one remaining
mystery that we've finally solved.

01:11:13.401 --> 01:11:16.819
The biggest question of them all,
"Who is the Batman?"

01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:19.755
And we finally figured out the answer.

01:11:19.806 --> 01:11:20.692
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:23.943 --> 01:11:25.661
Oh, this should be good.

01:11:25.712 --> 01:11:29.566
Batman is the warmest, kindest,

01:11:29.617 --> 01:11:31.834
most big-hearted soul we've ever met.

01:11:31.885 --> 01:11:34.271
A great big teddy bat.

01:11:34.322 --> 01:11:36.005
Aw...

01:11:36.856 --> 01:11:39.140
Then I hope you'll keep that to yourselves.

01:11:39.191 --> 01:11:41.844
The criminal underworld
would have a field day if they knew.

01:11:41.895 --> 01:11:44.280
Your secret's safe with us.

01:11:44.331 --> 01:11:46.049
No promises.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.886
I almost forgot, a bat snack for Scooby.

01:11:50.937 --> 01:11:52.525
- You've earned it.
- Yeah!

01:12:02.348 --> 01:12:06.037
Holy Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Batman!
