-Peter, you're not even dressed.
-For what?

00:38.222 --> 00:40.357
Chris's class is performing
a rock and roll choir.

00:40.390 --> 00:42.192
They've been practicing
for months.

00:42.226 --> 00:44.194
"For months," or "four months"?

00:44.228 --> 00:46.029
For months. Three months.

00:46.062 --> 00:47.697
Not long enough. Pass.

00:47.731 --> 00:49.233
I just wish we were doing songs

TV NARRATOR: We now return
to a 1980s movie

01:07.917 --> 01:09.319
you remember fondly,

01:09.353 --> 01:11.255
but now feels
excruciatingly slow.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.422
All right, Stripes.

01:12.456 --> 01:14.057
Ah, this was hilarious.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.992
All right,
Bill Murray's driving a cab.

01:16.025 --> 01:17.927
-Still driving a cab.
-(car horn honks on TV)

01:17.961 --> 01:20.063
Shot of the town.

01:20.096 --> 01:22.899
Going over a bridge.

01:22.932 --> 01:24.501
Traffic's neither
heavy nor light.

01:24.534 --> 01:26.170
Get in the Army!

01:26.203 --> 01:28.172
I hope you don't plan
on just lying on the couch

01:28.205 --> 01:30.106
and watching TV all weekend.

01:30.140 --> 01:31.975
That's exactly
what I plan to do.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.110
It's a free premium channel
preview weekend.

01:34.144 --> 01:35.679
Even Cinemax.

01:35.712 --> 01:38.415
One of the shows is actually
two boobs fighting.

01:38.448 --> 01:40.317
Sadly, there's still
no penetration.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.319
Well, just expect me to do

01:42.352 --> 01:44.788
a lot of sour-faced,
arms-folded head shaking.

01:44.821 --> 01:46.122
(grunts)

01:46.156 --> 01:47.824
Well, in return,

01:47.857 --> 01:50.126
you'll get a lot of
beaten-down husband eye-rolls.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.295
(sighs)

01:51.328 --> 01:52.762
-(grunts)
-(sighs)

01:52.796 --> 01:53.930
-(Lois grunts)
-(sighs)

01:53.963 --> 01:55.131
-(grunts)
-(sighs)

01:55.165 --> 01:56.433
-(grunts)
-(tapping on window)

01:56.466 --> 01:57.834
One of the neighbors
called about

01:57.867 --> 02:00.704
a passive-aggressive
domestic dispute.

02:00.737 --> 02:02.372
Ooh, is that Stripes?

02:02.406 --> 02:04.974
Eh, he's not in the Army yet.

02:06.743 --> 02:08.212
Peter, this is ridiculous.

02:08.245 --> 02:09.846
You've been lying here
all weekend.

02:09.879 --> 02:12.282
I'm not bringing you
any more food.

02:12.316 --> 02:14.351
I don't need you to.
I got a thousand dollar credit

02:14.384 --> 02:16.886
from Uber Eats 'cause
that driver pinched my bottom.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.156
Okay, well if you don't get up,
I won't have sex with you.

02:20.190 --> 02:22.326
And that will be
different how...?

02:22.359 --> 02:24.694
And I'm still married
to you because...?

02:24.728 --> 02:25.862
(tapping on window)

02:25.895 --> 02:29.165
Guys, second time this week.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.372
Peter, you got to come outside.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.207
We found a used condom
on the sidewalk.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.409
That's a bigger deal
than regular garbage.

02:39.443 --> 02:41.478
Ribbed.
A woman was pleased with it.

02:41.511 --> 02:42.646
You got to see this, Peter.

02:42.679 --> 02:43.813
A used condom.

02:43.847 --> 02:44.914
Just right out here.

02:44.948 --> 02:46.483
And there's panties nearby.

02:46.516 --> 02:47.551
Joe, you're a cop.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.652
What do you think happened here?

02:48.685 --> 02:49.986
I'll tell you what happened.

02:50.019 --> 02:51.655
Somebody did it.

02:51.688 --> 02:53.523
Yeah!

02:53.557 --> 02:55.359
Peter, come out here
and high five us

02:55.392 --> 02:57.160
over the sex someone else had.

02:57.193 --> 02:58.828
Someone had sex?

02:58.862 --> 03:01.698
I got to touch another guy's
hand to celebrate.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.269
(gasps)

03:06.270 --> 03:08.605
(grunting)

03:13.076 --> 03:14.711
(marching music playing)

03:14.744 --> 03:17.914
PETER:
Oh, now he gets to the Army.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.552
Hmm. I've seen this before.

03:22.586 --> 03:25.021
It's from Ethan Allen,
if I'm not mistaken.

03:25.054 --> 03:27.223
-Am I gonna be okay?
-You'll be fine.

03:27.257 --> 03:29.559
Here's a video
to help you understand.

03:33.062 --> 03:36.733
Hi, I'm Oliver Platt, and I'm
currently fused to this chair.

03:36.766 --> 03:38.302
But how does it happen?

03:38.335 --> 03:39.969
When a fat guy's sweaty skin

03:40.003 --> 03:41.471
presses against couch fabric

03:41.505 --> 03:43.239
for an extended period of time,

03:43.273 --> 03:46.376
the fabric fibers
fuse together with the skin.

03:46.410 --> 03:49.879
The longer you stay sedentary,
the stronger the bond.

03:49.913 --> 03:51.247
My advice: relax.

03:51.281 --> 03:52.816
It's not the end of the world.

03:52.849 --> 03:55.218
Being fused to furniture
hasn't stopped me

03:55.251 --> 03:57.053
from being an adult
with a child's name.

03:57.086 --> 04:00.056
And having thicker hair
than a werewolf.

04:00.089 --> 04:02.726
The procedure is called
"Rip You Off Real Fast."

04:02.759 --> 04:04.728
Very painful. Ready?

04:04.761 --> 04:06.963
Actually, I've decided
to keep the couch on me.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.732
Really? Are you sure?

04:08.765 --> 04:10.300
Oh, yeah. This is nothing.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.835
I've been in uncomfortable
situations before.

04:11.868 --> 04:14.671
Like, whenever
I meet famous people.

04:14.704 --> 04:17.641
Hey, what's up? I'm Snoop Dogg,
know what I'm saying?

04:17.674 --> 04:19.242
I do.

04:19.275 --> 04:22.178
PETER: But you don't, Peter,
you don't.

04:25.882 --> 04:27.517
How is it? Is-a good?

04:27.551 --> 04:28.618
Eh, it's a little tight.

04:28.652 --> 04:30.186
A little tight in-a the couch?

04:30.219 --> 04:31.955
Yeah, it's a little tight
in the couch.

04:31.988 --> 04:33.423
Hey, what's it like
going through life

04:33.457 --> 04:34.824
holding needles in your lips?

04:34.858 --> 04:36.259
Is-a not easy.

04:36.292 --> 04:37.927
Some-a time-a the needle,
they poke-a my lip,

04:37.961 --> 04:39.496
and I say-a, "Mamma mia!"

04:39.529 --> 04:41.365
Well, you still got
James Brolin coming in here,

04:41.398 --> 04:42.466
autographing your photos.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.633
That's kind of cool.

04:43.667 --> 04:44.934
You want to know
something, a-Peter?

04:44.968 --> 04:46.302
He no come in here.

04:46.336 --> 04:48.872
I take-a the photo
from the dry cleaner's.

04:48.905 --> 04:50.340
Mamma mia, what a day.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.841
And now to say good night

04:51.875 --> 04:54.944
to all-a my celebrity pictures
on-a the wall.

04:54.978 --> 04:56.880
Buona notte,
Christopher Plummer.

04:56.913 --> 04:59.983
Sleep-a with the angels,
Sherman-a Hemsley.

05:00.016 --> 05:02.619
See you when-a the sun shine,
Ken Ober.

05:02.652 --> 05:06.022
And now, to say good night
to my favorite-a celebrity,

05:06.055 --> 05:08.558
James-a Brol-- mamma mia!

05:08.592 --> 05:10.394
Who steal-a my James Brolin?

05:10.427 --> 05:12.962
I take-a that photo
from the bakery.

05:12.996 --> 05:15.399
Pasta fazool,
what a good day in-a the bakery.

05:15.432 --> 05:17.200
You take-a good care
of the place

05:17.233 --> 05:19.168
while I'm-a gone,
William-a Katt.

05:19.202 --> 05:24.207
That goes a-double for you,
James-a Brol-- mamma mia!

05:27.944 --> 05:29.846
Uh, hey, Mom?

05:29.879 --> 05:33.483
Was I always able to see the
living room from the kitchen?

05:33.517 --> 05:35.184
(sighs)
I've had enough of this.

05:35.218 --> 05:37.654
That stupid couch
is messing up our house.

05:37.687 --> 05:39.489
If Peter won't let
Dr. Hartman remove it,

05:39.523 --> 05:41.090
we're doing it ourselves.

05:41.124 --> 05:43.693
I put an Ambien in his beer,
so he's out cold.

05:43.727 --> 05:45.929
I saw you put Ambien
in your beer, too.

05:45.962 --> 05:48.598
Every adult has
to take Ambien every night

05:48.632 --> 05:51.234
to even have a prayer at sleep.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.502
(snoring)

05:52.536 --> 05:54.671
(door creaks)

05:54.704 --> 05:56.840
All right, kids,
we're gonna use these scissors

05:56.873 --> 05:59.676
to separate your father
from the couch.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.578
I can't tell skin from couch.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.079
Well, err on the skin side.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.881
I love this couch.

06:04.914 --> 06:06.883
It's from Ethan Allen, you know.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.253
(scissors snipping)

06:10.286 --> 06:12.088
Wha...?

06:12.121 --> 06:13.690
W-What-what's going on?

06:13.723 --> 06:16.359
Peter, enough is enough,
that couch is coming off.

06:16.392 --> 06:18.261
We're sick of your shenanigans.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.597
(grunts)
How dare you?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.032
I work my ass off to bring home
the bacon for this family,

06:23.066 --> 06:24.901
and all you can say is,
"We don't want bacon,

06:24.934 --> 06:26.536
we want actual money!"

06:26.570 --> 06:29.372
Well, I don't have money,
I spent it all on bacon!

06:29.405 --> 06:31.207
Peter, put yourself
in our shoes.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.877
I can't. My feet swelled up
too much from all the bacon.

06:33.910 --> 06:35.745
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to sleep

06:35.779 --> 06:37.481
on the couch on the couch.

06:37.514 --> 06:38.948
(grunts)

06:41.685 --> 06:43.687
(grunting)

06:49.593 --> 06:51.595
(grunting)

06:57.501 --> 06:59.503
Chris, give me a hand with this.

06:59.536 --> 07:01.137
All right, you ready?

07:01.170 --> 07:03.840
All right, one, two, three.

07:03.873 --> 07:05.441
-Okay, uh, easy, easy, easy...
-Uh... uh...

07:05.475 --> 07:07.276
-Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
-Okay, all right.

07:07.310 --> 07:08.678
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

07:08.712 --> 07:10.146
-Stop, stop.
-What? What?

07:10.179 --> 07:12.115
-No, no, no, no, no. Twist it.
-What? I am.

07:12.148 --> 07:14.017
Just look down, all right?
Just-just look at me,

07:14.050 --> 07:15.852
look what I'm doing. All right,
see the way I'm twisting it?

07:15.885 --> 07:18.187
-Okay, ju-- No, no, no, no, no.
-Okay. Wait-- what?

07:18.221 --> 07:20.323
You know what? All right, just--
hang-- just put-put it down.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.425
-Put it down. Just drop it,
drop it.
-All right. All right.

07:22.458 --> 07:25.995
All right, let's... Let's just
hang on and figure this out.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.097
All-all right, okay.

07:28.131 --> 07:29.933
All right. Okay. I-I got it.
I know what we're gonna...

07:29.966 --> 07:31.535
Okay, okay. All right, y-you--
we-- here's what we're gonna do,

07:31.568 --> 07:33.169
We're gonna take
the cushions off,

07:33.202 --> 07:35.271
unscrew the legs,
take the mattress out,

07:35.304 --> 07:37.140
and this whole thing's
gonna be a lot simpler.

07:37.173 --> 07:39.509
It's easier
than we're making it.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.477
-(grunting)
-This isn't working.

07:41.511 --> 07:43.212
You know what?
Just give me a push.

07:43.246 --> 07:44.313
(grunts)

07:44.347 --> 07:45.481
(screaming)

07:45.515 --> 07:48.417
(crashes)

07:54.490 --> 07:55.959
I have some bad news.

07:55.992 --> 07:58.628
Ethan survived,
but Allen didn't make it.

07:58.662 --> 08:00.530
-What about Peter?
-Oh, him.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.532
He's in what we call a comma.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.867
Now, where's his chart?

08:03.900 --> 08:06.703
Ah, here it is.
"Griffin coma Peter."

08:06.736 --> 08:08.705
Will he ever recover?

08:08.738 --> 08:10.406
How long is he gonna
be like this?

08:10.439 --> 08:12.909
(echoing): Please tell me
he's gonna be okay...

08:12.942 --> 08:14.944
(wind gusting)

08:25.354 --> 08:26.590
Oh, God.

08:26.623 --> 08:28.625
(male clears throat)

08:36.399 --> 08:37.934
God?

08:37.967 --> 08:39.002
Yes.

08:39.035 --> 08:40.536
And no Trump questions.

08:40.570 --> 08:42.305
Okay.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.709
I have nothing else to ask you.

08:51.981 --> 08:54.951
I can't believe I'm stuck
in an elevator with God.

08:54.984 --> 08:57.754
Although, I guess you are
everywhere, and in all places.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.022
No, you're thinking
of Kevin Hart.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.223
Ha! I know, right?

09:00.256 --> 09:01.290
(laughing):
I-In every movie.

09:01.324 --> 09:02.358
Him and The Rock.

09:02.391 --> 09:03.627
Oh, I love The Rock.

09:03.660 --> 09:05.194
No, no, no,
I love The Rock, too.

09:05.228 --> 09:07.731
He's just-he's just in
a lot of stuff.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.398
You know, his real name
is Dwayne Johnson.

09:09.432 --> 09:10.566
Yeah, I know.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.235
We have Us Weekly on Earth, too.

09:12.268 --> 09:14.203
Wait, why are you here?

09:14.237 --> 09:15.605
Shouldn't you be up in heaven?

09:15.639 --> 09:16.706
There was an issue.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.374
Uh, a-a few angels came forward.

09:18.407 --> 09:20.543
I don't remember things
exactly as they do,

09:20.576 --> 09:23.980
but I respect their experience.

09:24.013 --> 09:25.782
How did I get here?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.583
Well, you had a couch
attached to your back,

09:27.617 --> 09:30.253
and you fell down the stairs
and hit your head pretty hard.

09:30.286 --> 09:31.755
Am I in a Leftovers?

09:31.788 --> 09:32.922
Is this a Leftovers?

09:32.956 --> 09:34.423
I don't know what that is.

09:34.457 --> 09:37.593
It was an HBO show starring
a bottle of hair dye.

09:38.594 --> 09:40.296
Man, this thing is really stuck.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.832
Hey, can you use
your God powers to get us out?

09:42.866 --> 09:44.333
No, they don't really work
in elevators.

09:44.367 --> 09:45.568
Kind of like a cell phone.

09:45.601 --> 09:46.736
I don't have a signal.

09:46.770 --> 09:47.771
I have a cell phone.

09:47.804 --> 09:48.905
It's silver.

09:48.938 --> 09:50.974
That's rad, Peter.

09:52.776 --> 09:56.145
I always dreamed of being stuck
in an elevator with Tom Brady.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.681
That makes two of us.

09:57.714 --> 09:59.816
Can I ask you
my Tom Brady questions?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.985
I wouldn't deign
to speak for Tom Brady.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.520
Understood, understood.

10:04.553 --> 10:07.691
-Hey, do atheists go to hell?
-No.

10:07.724 --> 10:09.693
How about people who say
they are not religious,

10:09.726 --> 10:11.427
but they are spiritual?

10:11.460 --> 10:13.129
Straight to hell,
to the boiler room of hell.

10:13.162 --> 10:14.964
All the way down.

10:14.998 --> 10:16.199
Sometimes, I pull them out

10:16.232 --> 10:17.667
just so they think everything
is gonna be okay,

10:17.701 --> 10:19.335
but then,
I put them right back in.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.037
Good, good.

10:21.070 --> 10:22.872
That makes me happy.

10:22.906 --> 10:26.209
Um, God, here's something
you might be able to tell me.

10:26.242 --> 10:27.811
Will Taylor Swift and Katy Perry

10:27.844 --> 10:31.781
ever reconcile
their differences?

10:31.815 --> 10:33.116
What are you looking for?

10:33.149 --> 10:34.951
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm looking for the gay guy

10:34.984 --> 10:36.152
who can answer that one.

10:38.321 --> 10:41.157
Some people say we're just
a computer simulation

10:41.190 --> 10:42.992
run by a higher species.

10:43.026 --> 10:45.161
-Is that true?
-It is.

10:45.194 --> 10:47.663
(computer tones play)

10:47.697 --> 10:49.198
My guy sucks.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.234
Want to trade guys
for a little while?

10:51.267 --> 10:53.169
Oh, never mind.

10:53.202 --> 10:56.472
I'll stick with this pile
of crap I already have.

10:56.505 --> 11:00.143
All right, can you name every
SNL actor alphabetically?

11:00.176 --> 11:02.378
-Alphabetically by last name?
-Yes.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.480
-And no featured players?
-Yeah, okay.

11:04.513 --> 11:07.851
Fred Armisen, Dan Aykroyd,
Morwenna Banks, Vanessa Bayer...

11:07.884 --> 11:10.319
...Jon Lovitz, Norm Macdonald,
Gail Matthius--

11:10.353 --> 11:11.654
Gail Matthius, good pull.

11:11.687 --> 11:13.522
Michael McKean,
Mark McKinney...

11:13.556 --> 11:17.026
...Nancy Walls, Kristen Wiig,
and Sasheer Zamata.

11:17.060 --> 11:19.495
Wow. Now do Kids in the Hall.

11:19.528 --> 11:21.330
That was five guys, Peter.

11:21.364 --> 11:23.066
-Name 'em.
-I can't.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.102
Does reincarnation exist?

11:26.135 --> 11:27.403
It does.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.505
As past human lives
or as animals?

11:29.538 --> 11:31.340
-Both.
-Who have I been?

11:31.374 --> 11:33.176
-You were Henry the Eighth.
-Wow!

11:33.209 --> 11:36.045
Let me finish. You were Henry,
the eighth guy to have sex

11:36.079 --> 11:38.181
with Rock Hudson
at one of his pool parties.

11:38.214 --> 11:40.183
Aww.

11:40.216 --> 11:42.618
How many more shows is
John Stamos gonna get?

11:42.651 --> 11:46.655
-Zero.
-Good. That's-- That's good.

11:50.659 --> 11:52.695
Are you real?

11:52.728 --> 11:54.363
Do you think I'm real,
Peter?

11:54.397 --> 11:57.533
I like to believe there's
something bigger than me

11:57.566 --> 11:59.202
out there keeping a watch out.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.104
Different people think
different things.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.872
I'm kind of like a nanny cam.

12:02.906 --> 12:04.908
The idea that
I may exist is enough

12:04.941 --> 12:06.876
for some people
to behave better.

12:06.910 --> 12:10.546
When I used to ask my mom
what God was, she would say,

12:10.579 --> 12:13.716
"God is love."
I always liked that.

12:13.749 --> 12:15.118
That's nice, Peter.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.553
God and love are
very similar concepts.

12:17.586 --> 12:19.722
-They come from the same place.
-Tatooine?

12:19.755 --> 12:23.492
Ha! I always forget
you're such a Star Wars guy.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.230
Man, when are they gonna fix
this elevator?

12:27.263 --> 12:30.934
It's not broken. I just haven't
decided where it's going yet.

12:34.103 --> 12:36.505
(gasps)
What's a "mezzanine"?

12:36.539 --> 12:38.908
-It's like a loge.
-What's a "loge"?

12:38.942 --> 12:40.743
Oh, hey, what's with
all the questions?

12:40.776 --> 12:43.012
Yeah, you don't know either.

12:43.046 --> 12:44.480
W-Wait, hold on.

12:44.513 --> 12:48.017
-Am I-- Am I dead?
-Yes.

12:48.051 --> 12:50.153
Oh, my God!

12:50.186 --> 12:52.488
Since you're now a ghost,
would you like to do pottery

12:52.521 --> 12:54.423
while straddling
present-day Demi Moore?

12:54.457 --> 12:56.592
-Pass.
-Yeah.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.627
Not getting a lot of takers
for that one.

12:58.661 --> 13:00.496
I feel like
the bones in her back

13:00.529 --> 13:02.531
would hurt my tummy.

13:05.168 --> 13:07.837
Am I-- Am I really dead?

13:07.871 --> 13:08.938
Well, if you weren't dead,

13:08.972 --> 13:11.107
would you feel nothing
when I do this?

13:11.140 --> 13:12.942
Ah! Son of a bitch!

13:12.976 --> 13:14.377
Oh, you know what?
That's right, it takes a day.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.678
M-My bad. Sorry.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.180
Tomorrow I do that,
you feel nothing.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.514
But trust me, you're dead.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.483
But I can't be.
Hold on, give me a sec.

13:20.516 --> 13:23.953
(panting)

13:23.987 --> 13:26.890
I can't be dead.
I have a family who needs me.

13:26.923 --> 13:28.491
Actually, Peter,
from what I've seen,

13:28.524 --> 13:31.060
I think your family would be
better off without you.

13:31.094 --> 13:32.896
What? What do you mean?

13:32.929 --> 13:34.463
Well, you're an
inattentive husband

13:34.497 --> 13:35.798
and a terrible parent.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.500
Oh, says Father of the Year.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.468
Oh, please. He played that
for all it was worth.

13:39.502 --> 13:41.137
"Why has thou forsaken me?"

13:41.170 --> 13:42.872
You know what?
I did him a favor.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.640
Okay, well, th-there's a lot
to unpack there.

13:44.673 --> 13:46.910
But come on, God, you gotta
give me another chance.

13:46.943 --> 13:49.712
I'll show you how good a husband
and father I can be.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.148
Are you asking for
a second chance?

13:52.181 --> 13:53.716
I-I guess so.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.652
Huh. No one's ever done that.

13:56.685 --> 13:58.321
You know what? You're on.

13:58.354 --> 14:00.156
I'll give you one day
to prove to me

14:00.189 --> 14:02.091
that your family is better off
with you alive.

14:02.125 --> 14:05.228
I'll return you to your life
before you were in a coma.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.363
Thanks, God! I know I can do it.

14:07.396 --> 14:09.398
I've faced bigger challenges.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.201
Like when I recorded that
Russian language album.

14:12.235 --> 14:14.170

Okay, kids. I know how you
always wanted kittens,

14:44.467 --> 14:46.302

She doesn't want to be
around people right now.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.715
She needs a quiet space
to have her kittens.

14:59.748 --> 15:01.584
Yeah, so everyone
gather 'round close.

15:01.617 --> 15:04.053

to help with the birth.

as a family?

15:20.769 --> 15:24.040
Let's go spend it in the ER.

15:27.110 --> 15:29.112
(indistinct chatter)

15:31.047 --> 15:33.949
Well, look at us.
Out for a fun family dinner.

15:33.983 --> 15:36.752
If anyone's watching, they'd
say, "Look at that family.

15:36.785 --> 15:38.421
Look how happy they are."

15:38.454 --> 15:40.689
Well, the kids do love
Fuddruckers.

15:40.723 --> 15:42.625
Yeah, getting to design
any burger you want?

15:42.658 --> 15:45.161
Your only limit is
your imagination.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.695
What kind you make there
for yourself, Chris?

15:46.729 --> 15:48.097
-Plain.
-Plain?

15:48.131 --> 15:49.698
What do you mean "plain"?

15:49.732 --> 15:52.101
It's a plain burger.
That's how I like them.

15:52.135 --> 15:54.603
That's not a burger,
that's just a meat sandwich.

15:54.637 --> 15:56.939
At least Meg went wild
and got a beige burger.

15:56.972 --> 15:58.441
No, I got chicken.

15:58.474 --> 16:00.976
What? Here?
This is Fuddruckers.

16:01.010 --> 16:03.046
What-- what part of Fuddruckers
don't you understand?

16:03.079 --> 16:04.347
All of it.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.514
All right,
let's start this again.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.882
You're all gonna get up,

16:06.915 --> 16:09.018
go back up to that
toppings bar, and go nuts.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.020
But it tastes good like this.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.489
It's not supposed to taste good.
It's supposed to look crazy.

16:13.522 --> 16:14.657
What the hell are you doing?

16:14.690 --> 16:16.559
I'm cutting it.
It's easier to eat.

16:16.592 --> 16:18.127
It's not supposed to be
easy to eat.

16:18.161 --> 16:19.995
Half of it is supposed
to fall onto your plate

16:20.029 --> 16:22.365
when you squeeze it, and the
rest goes onto your shirt.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.699
How's everything going
over here?

16:23.732 --> 16:25.301
Terrible! Go away!

16:25.334 --> 16:27.503
See, look, now I have to be
even more ridiculous

16:27.536 --> 16:29.505
to make up for what you guys
aren't doing.

16:29.538 --> 16:32.408
Silverware? Put them on.
Salt shaker? Whatever.

16:32.441 --> 16:34.477
Ice from soda,
get on that burger.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.079
Peter, people are staring.

16:36.112 --> 16:38.214
Yeah, they're saying,
"Look at the creative guy.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.982
"Look at King Fuddrucker

16:45.621 --> 16:47.323
Not yet, I'm not.
Give me the car keys.

16:47.356 --> 16:50.393
-Peter...
-Give me... the car keys.

out of our car.

17:01.070 --> 17:03.539
Good. That's also Fuddruckers--
get used to it.

And prepare to fish my teeth
out of my stool.

17:05.974 --> 17:08.511
-Peter, enough.
-You guys clearly don't get it.

17:08.544 --> 17:11.180
I'm sure when you explain
what we're supposed to get,

17:11.214 --> 17:12.515
we'll get it.

18:20.616 --> 18:24.187
Before you go,
there's something I want to say.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.121
If anything were to happen
to me, Lois,

18:26.155 --> 18:28.324
I'll miss you more than life...

18:28.357 --> 18:32.127
the cereal, but not the board
game, which I quite enjoy.

18:32.161 --> 18:34.129
-Okay.
-And Meg,

18:34.163 --> 18:35.531
I'm sorry I'll never
get a chance

18:35.564 --> 18:38.167
to walk you down the aisle...
at Costco,

18:38.201 --> 18:40.469
to furnish your sad,
single-lady apartment.

18:40.503 --> 18:42.638
-Thanks, Dad.
-And Stewie,

18:42.671 --> 18:46.775
it kills me that I'll never see
you become a man-- loving twink.

18:46.809 --> 18:48.444
Is anyone gonna stop him?

18:48.477 --> 18:51.280
And, Chris, whenever you're
feeling defeated,

18:51.314 --> 18:54.950
I want you to remember to always
reach for the Stars--

18:54.983 --> 18:58.153
sky and Hutch DVD that fell
behind the entertainment center.

18:58.187 --> 19:00.122
Sorry, you were the last one.

19:00.155 --> 19:02.024
-What about me?
-You're a dog.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.827
Peter, what's going on?
Why are you saying these things?

19:04.860 --> 19:07.230
Sorry. W-Why don't you guys
go inside?

19:07.263 --> 19:09.365
I'm gonna stay out here and
listen to Nina Blackwood

19:09.398 --> 19:11.700
slowly die of throat cancer
on the radio.

19:13.602 --> 19:16.239
WOMAN (scratchy voice): Our next
artist first climbed the charts

19:16.272 --> 19:18.507
with "Dancing With Myself."

19:18.541 --> 19:23.178
(wheezes) Of course,
that artist is Billy Idol.

19:23.212 --> 19:25.348
-(radio switches off)
-I'm supposed to get her
a week from Thursday,

19:25.381 --> 19:27.416
but I may be moving that up.

19:27.450 --> 19:30.386
I suppose you know why
I'm here.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.421
Yeah. I guess so.

19:32.455 --> 19:34.357
It's weird.
For the first seven days,

19:34.390 --> 19:36.892
all I did was create things,
but since then,

19:36.925 --> 19:38.427
it's just killing,
killing, killing.

19:38.461 --> 19:40.062
Well, go ahead and do it.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.997
My family would be better off
without me.

19:42.030 --> 19:44.833
I'm a terrible husband
and a terrible father.

19:44.867 --> 19:46.502
I should never have
questioned you.

19:46.535 --> 19:48.971
You were right about everything.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.575
Say that again.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.443
You were right about everything.

19:54.477 --> 19:56.712
That's all I needed to hear.

19:58.814 --> 20:00.082
That's what religion is.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.850
It's not about being good
or bad.

20:01.884 --> 20:05.454
It's just blind subservience
to an imaginary being.

20:05.488 --> 20:07.356
So, I'm not gonna die?

20:07.390 --> 20:09.057
Nope, not for another
four years.

20:09.091 --> 20:10.359
Thank you, God!

20:10.393 --> 20:13.929
Bless you, my child...
pornography fan.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.298
(laughs)
You did it to me.

20:15.331 --> 20:17.900
-Can I use that one on my son?
-Sure.

20:19.268 --> 20:21.537
PETER: Hey, Chris, you like
pictures of naked children

20:21.570 --> 20:23.138
because you're gross and weird.

20:23.171 --> 20:25.240
Ah, he screwed it up.

20:31.179 --> 20:32.548
And I'm sorry about Fuddruckers.

20:32.581 --> 20:33.949
It won't happen again.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.219
Because nothing means more to me
than my family.

20:37.252 --> 20:40.656
Oh, Peter. That's wonderful.
What helped you come around?

20:40.689 --> 20:43.326
Well, Lois, let's just say
the big man upstairs

20:43.359 --> 20:45.894
put in a hard day's work today.

20:45.928 --> 20:49.264
Well, looks like quitting time.

20:49.298 --> 20:51.434
Good night, Kirk Cameron.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.402
See you tomorrow, Gene Rayburn.

20:53.436 --> 20:57.673
See you when the sun rises,
James Bro-- Mamma mia!
