Glad you're here, Sugar!

01:12.781 --> 01:13.615
Hi, guys.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.658
Can we play princess today?

Or dragon stomp.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.620
Stomp! Stomp!

01:18.870 --> 01:21.915
No time for games, people.
I need a checkup.

What in the warbling
wombats do you think
you got this time?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.796
I don't "think."
I know.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.048
Feel my belly.
It's all lumpy.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.092
Come on, Chilly.
Let's check it out.

Huh. Is she okay?

01:39.224 --> 01:42.352
She does seem
a little draggy and saggy.

Can I have the tweezers
so I can look
in Chilly's ears?

01:54.447 --> 01:58.076
Wait. What?
Did I say tweezers?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.828
I didn't mean
the tweezers.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.497
Didn't think so,
but you're the Doc.

Okay, you have
Stuffed-belly-itis.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.649
Oh, no!
What does that mean?

02:29.732 --> 02:32.193
It means your belly
is filled with stuffing,

02:32.277 --> 02:34.988
just like it's
supposed to be.
You're fine.

02:35.071 --> 02:38.241
I'm fine!
Wait. I'm fine?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.450
Oh, okay, then.

Chilly may be fine,

you are, Doc.

Yes, but she's sick!

is running.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.153
I have a diagnosis.

03:57.237 --> 04:01.032
Doc, you have
a severe case
of Leaky-sniffle-itis.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.576
And I think you have a fever.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.955

but we're used
to treating toys.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.209
we'd be on it.

you need a doctor.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.882
I guess I'd better
go see my mom.

let you go

a checkup.

take your temperature.

Oh, Sweetie,
you have a little fever.

I do?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.852
Oh, I think
you've got the flu,

05:53.144 --> 05:55.813
but you'll feel better
if you drink lots of liquids

05:55.897 --> 05:56.939

a little music?

we can get you?

It's over there.

for your body to get better

Sleep tight, Doc.

Cool as a cucumber.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.875
Morning, everyone.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.086
How are you feeling today, Doc?

11:10.378 --> 11:13.047
Good. I think
I'm lots better.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.841
Thanks for letting me rest.
[knocking on door]

Morning, Sweetpea.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.262
Hi, Mom.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.599
You feel cool.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.559
I feel so much better.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.853
I have the best care ever.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.647
Aw, thanks.

11:29.730 --> 11:30.856
[chuckles]

11:30.940 --> 11:32.691
Mom, can I
go out and play?

11:33.150 --> 11:36.779
As long as
you take it easy,
I don't see why not.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.197
Thanks, Mom.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.325
Take it easy
now, Sugar.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.535
Let me take
your bag.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.621
Oh, uh, okay.
Thanks, Stuffy.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.791
Uh! Whoa! Whoa!

11:50.084 --> 11:51.460
[grunts] You're welcome.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.712
Oh, sit. Sit!

11:53.796 --> 11:56.215
Guys, I'm okay.
Really.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.634
I rested,
and I'm totally better,

11:58.717 --> 12:00.553
so you don't have
to worry about me.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.472

Oh, that's good,

my Stuffed-belly-itis is back.

let's check it out.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.238
I'm gonna have to
take you to jail.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.283
You may be the king,
but you broke the law.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.034
I won't go.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.245
You'll never catch me!

12:27.288 --> 12:29.790
[faking police sirens]

12:29.874 --> 12:32.877
[Mom] Donny, come inside
and cool down, honey.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.379
I've got an ice-pop for you.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.381
Yay! Awesome!

12:37.465 --> 12:38.799
[Doc humming]

12:56.275 --> 12:57.902
Hi, guys.
[all] Hi.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.362
Whoowee! It's hotter
than a hippo

13:00.446 --> 13:02.114
dipped in hot sauce
out here.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.282
I know.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.284
That's why we're
sitting in the shade.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.785
What do you
have there?

13:06.869 --> 13:10.539
What? You mean
my dress-up jewels?

13:11.081 --> 13:14.001
Jewels fit
for a Wicked King?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.085
[laughs wickedly]

13:15.169 --> 13:18.172
As soon as I figure out how
to get them, they'll be mine,

13:18.255 --> 13:19.840
all mine!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.383
[laughs wickedly]

13:21.967 --> 13:23.177
Careful, you guys.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.721
These jewels are
just the kind of thing

13:25.804 --> 13:27.431
the Wicked King
likes to steal.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.724
[siren wailing]

13:29.183 --> 13:32.061
Ahem! Everything
all right here, Ma'am?

13:32.853 --> 13:34.772
Who are you
calling "Ma'am?"

13:35.272 --> 13:37.233
Uh, Stuffy?

13:37.691 --> 13:39.652
Huh? Oh.
[chuckles]

13:39.735 --> 13:40.569
Everything's fine.

13:40.945 --> 13:41.862
Thank you, Officer.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.406
Thanks for checking on us,
Officer Pete.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.574
Wanna stay and play?

13:46.033 --> 13:48.953
No. Have to take a pass, Doc.
I'm on duty,

13:49.245 --> 13:51.914
making sure
the yard is safe.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.250
But it's so hot.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.377
You should come
in the shade with us.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.628
It's much cooler.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.380
No can do, Doc.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.590
There's no saying
what might happen

14:01.674 --> 14:04.301
if I'm not out here
upholding the law.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.053
You kids have fun!

14:06.303 --> 14:08.222
And stay out of trouble,
you hear?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.892
Yep, crime doesn't
stop to cool off,

14:11.976 --> 14:15.479
and good thing
for all these toys,
neither do I.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.107
Neither do I.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.568
Uh!
Whoo!

14:22.111 --> 14:23.112
Aw!

14:23.195 --> 14:24.154
[siren wailing]

14:25.322 --> 14:26.198
[both] He did it!

14:29.410 --> 14:30.619
[siren wailing]

14:31.453 --> 14:34.456
You boys have permission
to build a skyscraper here?

14:38.252 --> 14:40.087
[siren wailing]

14:42.006 --> 14:44.967
[over PA]
<span style="style.default_1">Pull over to the side</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of the yard, son.</span>

14:45.801 --> 14:48.804
Officer Pete sure
is working hard
in this heat.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.348
I sure feel safer
with him around.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.184
And I do like
a car in uniform.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.021
So, who wants to go
inside where it's cool?

14:57.104 --> 14:59.106
[all exclaiming]

15:00.107 --> 15:03.235
Huh. That's weird.
Where'd my necklace go?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.820
[laughing wickedly]

15:05.571 --> 15:08.115
[gasps] The Wicked King!
He stole the necklace!

15:08.198 --> 15:09.617
Somebody stop him!

15:11.619 --> 15:13.245
[laughing]

15:13.579 --> 15:16.916
This looks like a job
for a brave dragon.

15:17.499 --> 15:21.879
And a not so brave
but very big dinosaur.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.339
That's me.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.925
I think we'd better
call in the professionals.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.343
[whistles]

15:27.426 --> 15:30.137
Officer Pete?
Thief coming your way!

15:30.220 --> 15:32.473
Roger that.
I'm on the case.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.937
[over PA]
<span style="style.default_1">This is the police.</span>

15:38.020 --> 15:40.022
<span style="style.default_1">Pull over immediately.</span>

15:46.695 --> 15:48.948
You'll never
catch me, copper!

15:49.031 --> 15:50.199
[laughs]

15:50.282 --> 15:52.117
Oh, goose feathers.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.661
-[tires screeching]
-Ah!

15:54.954 --> 15:55.788
Bah!

15:56.163 --> 15:59.833
Stop in the name
of the law.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.252
You'll never
catch me now.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.672
But we will.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.924
Ooh! Ah!
Not so fast.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.385
Did we get him?
Oh, there he is.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.469
Ooh! Got him!

16:10.552 --> 16:12.596
Crime never pays,
my friend.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.890
You're under arrest.
[steam hisses]

16:15.474 --> 16:17.476
Double goose feathers.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.605
Nice work,
you guys.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.191
Pete, are you okay?

16:24.608 --> 16:25.859
You look more worn out

16:25.943 --> 16:27.695
than a pair
of elephant sneakers.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.448
Uh, yeah. I guess
my engine's just,

16:31.532 --> 16:34.159
uh, running a little
slow today.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.744
[strained chuckles]

16:37.246 --> 16:39.665
Why don't you come
to the clinic for a checkup?

16:39.748 --> 16:42.459
I'll find out why
you're feeling bad
and fix you up.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.045
Well, uh, appreciate it, Doc,

16:45.462 --> 16:48.340
but a police officer
never leaves his beat.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.218
Now, if everyone's
all right here,

16:51.593 --> 16:54.805
I'll just head on
back to my post.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.516
Uh... Ah...

16:57.599 --> 16:58.851
On second thought...

16:59.351 --> 17:04.064
A little check under
the hood might not be
such a bad idea.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.651
[door opens]
Ooh, shut the door!

17:11.905 --> 17:13.949
Well, hello to you,
too, Chilly.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.284
Oh, sorry, Doc,

17:15.367 --> 17:18.704
but that sun
could melt a snowman
in a heartbeat.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.875
Chilly, I keep telling you
you're not gonna melt

17:22.958 --> 17:24.877
because you're not
a real snowman.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.336
You're stuffed.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.674
Then why do I
feel so melty?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.844
I think we all feel
kinda "melty" today.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.512
Ready for your
checkup, Pete?

17:36.013 --> 17:38.057
Better safe than sorry,
right, Doc?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.141
[Doc] Right.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.313
Otoscope, please, Hallie.
Thanks.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.483
Follow the light
back and forth.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.986
Everything's kinda
spinning, Doc.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.114
Can you rev
your engine for me?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.365
[engine sputters]

17:55.741 --> 17:56.742
Hmm.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.120
I'm just gonna check
under your hood, now.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.247
Hey! You're hot.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.083
Here, try these.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.503
[steam hissing]

18:08.003 --> 18:10.798
Whew! You could
barbecue burgers
in there.

18:11.298 --> 18:14.551
Yeah! It's hotter than
my fiery dragon breath.

18:14.968 --> 18:15.969
Um...

18:16.053 --> 18:18.055
Well, if I had
fiery dragon breath,

18:18.138 --> 18:18.972
it would be.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.308
You're toasty
all right, Pete.

18:21.391 --> 18:22.893
I have a diagnosis.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.730
You have a burning case
of Overheat-itosis.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.149
Sounds like
a hot topic

18:29.233 --> 18:31.401
for <span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos.</span>

18:31.735 --> 18:33.570
See, metal toys

18:33.654 --> 18:35.823
outside in the hot sun
for a long time

18:35.906 --> 18:37.866
can get super-duper hot.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.410
And you've been
in the sun all day.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.662
But don't worry.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.123
A little cool-down time
should do the trick.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.792
I'm a little
confused here, Doc.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.544
I don't just feel hot.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.296
I got no motor
in my motor.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.297
Know what I mean?

18:52.756 --> 18:55.759
I can barely drive
without conking out.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.553
Yeah, I think I do.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.180
Once, my family
went on a hike
in the desert.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.683
I got so hot,
I could barely
keep walking

19:02.766 --> 19:04.143
and I felt
kind of dizzy.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.854
Yep, guess I should have
stayed in the shade

19:06.937 --> 19:08.564
with you guys
for a while.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.400
All right, give me the
straight scoop, Doc.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.360
What are you
charging me with?

19:13.861 --> 19:16.321
Pete, I'm charging you
with staying outside

19:16.405 --> 19:17.948
in the hot sun too long.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.576
You need some rest
and cool-down time inside.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.287
But Doc,
I can't leave my beat.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.497
Crime doesn't sleep,
you know?

19:25.914 --> 19:29.376
If you go back in the sun now,
you'll feel even worse.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.796
And then you really
won't be able to
take care of the toys.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.799
Going back outside
just isn't safe right now.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.259
They're right, Pete.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.512
Sometimes to stay safe,
you gotta get cool.

see it my way.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.282
I'll be right back.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.117
Don't you worry.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.787
We'll have you cool as
a cantaloupe in no time.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.959
Ah, that feels nice.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.752
Real nice.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.339
I've got just the thing
to help cool you down.

20:57.714 --> 20:58.548
A fish?

20:59.007 --> 21:01.218
[gasps] It's Bashie-fish!

21:01.635 --> 21:03.804
It's an ice-pack
from the freezer.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.265
My mom calls
them Bashie-fish.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.267
We use them
when we get a bashie...

21:08.350 --> 21:10.394
Or a bump.
Or a boo-boo.

21:11.228 --> 21:14.606
Oh, nice fishy.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.361
When the hot, hot red
turns to cool, cool blue,

21:19.736 --> 21:21.655
that'll mean
you're all through.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.532
Getting cool, that is.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.742
Looking good.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.245
Yeah, feeling good, too.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.831
Cooling down was
just the ticket.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.958
Is Pete cool
enough to cuddle?

21:33.667 --> 21:34.751
Definitely.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.837
[giggles]

21:37.629 --> 21:41.717
Hey! That little king dude
totally took my bracelet!

21:41.800 --> 21:44.052
Whoo! The Wicked King
has escaped!

21:44.469 --> 21:47.597
Doc, you gotta spring me!
Duty calls!

21:47.681 --> 21:48.765
You're clear to go.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.434
[siren wailing]

21:51.601 --> 21:53.186
[laughing wickedly]

21:56.982 --> 21:58.900
The jewels are mine.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.528
All mine! [laughs]

22:01.778 --> 22:03.405
[Pete] <span style="style.default_1">This is the police.</span>

22:03.488 --> 22:05.365
<span style="style.default_1">Come out with your hands up.</span>

22:05.991 --> 22:09.202
Hello. Notice anything
missing besides
the jewels?

22:09.286 --> 22:12.039
Like arms.
I don't have arms.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.166
Oh, yeah, right. Um...

22:14.249 --> 22:17.336
[on PA] <span style="style.default_1">Ahem.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Well, just come on out.</span>

22:17.419 --> 22:18.962
[laughs]

22:23.425 --> 22:26.553
Oh, triple goose
feathers.

22:28.805 --> 22:31.308
Way cool.
Thanks, Doc.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.934
Thanks,
Officer Pete.

22:33.351 --> 22:36.188
Well, just doing
my job, ma'am.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.105
Boys?

22:44.654 --> 22:45.697
Oh!

22:46.114 --> 22:47.240
Hey, Doc,

22:47.324 --> 22:48.950
thanks for
all your help.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.412
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better ♪</span>

22:52.496 --> 22:55.582
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Thank you, Doc, for taking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">All the ouches away ♪</span>

22:55.665 --> 22:57.918
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Didn't feel so good</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Till you fixed me ♪</span>

22:58.001 --> 23:00.003
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Like I knew that you would ♪</span>

23:00.837 --> 23:06.551
<span style="style.default_1">♪ And I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better now ♪</span>

23:07.052 --> 23:09.471
You know, Pete,
you can still stay on the beat.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.557
You just need to move
your post into the shade.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.476
Good idea, Doc!

23:14.893 --> 23:17.145
Better safe than sorry.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.440
All right, let this be
a lesson to you toys.

23:20.816 --> 23:25.779
On hot days like today,
keeping cool is the law.

23:25.862 --> 23:26.905
[siren wailing]

23:26.988 --> 23:28.532
Roger that,
Officer Pete.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.784
[laughter]

23:32.953 --> 23:34.871
Hey, everybody,
it's Doc here.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.083
<span style="style.default_1">To keep from spreading germs</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to your friends...</span>

23:40.127 --> 23:41.294
<span style="style.default_1">what should you do?</span>

23:42.087 --> 23:43.380
<span style="style.default_1">Wash your hands?</span>

23:45.298 --> 23:46.758
<span style="style.default_1">Play Hippo Bounce?</span>

23:49.219 --> 23:50.929
<span style="style.default_1">Or have a tickle-fest?</span>

23:53.473 --> 23:56.017
<span style="style.default_1">That's right.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Wash your hands.</span>

23:58.520 --> 23:59.354
Aww!
