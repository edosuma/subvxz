00:23.901 --> 00:25.761

officer via WhatsApp

it was a processing fee.

OK, then losing your Bitcoin
password and probably $40,000.

in a sham marriage.

not a sham!

finally snapped

00:52.782 --> 00:54.123

living out of a swag

00:55.823 --> 00:57.083

00:57.183 --> 00:59.123
was the same thing as

what he was giving me.

acting like he was separated.

just a fantasy,

how to turn it on, doesn't he?

until J can eat sushi?

23:27.540 --> 23:28.800
I don't know.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.280
Can we talk about how gross
her poos are right now?

23:31.380 --> 23:33.400
Can we NOT talk about that?

23:33.500 --> 23:35.080
She's...

23:35.180 --> 23:36.840
Do you have a delicate stomach?

23:36.940 --> 23:38.960
(LAUGHS) No, it's just,
you know,

23:39.060 --> 23:41.661
I'm trying to eat 200 bucks
worth of sushi right now.

23:46.661 --> 23:47.801
But yeah.

23:47.901 --> 23:49.901
Her poos are really
fucking rank right now.

23:51.421 --> 23:53.681
She's like an abominable
pooing machine.

23:53.781 --> 23:57.081
Each new food brings out
a chronic new poo.

23:57.181 --> 23:58.561
Eww!

23:58.661 --> 24:00.802
Sorry, I changed my mind.
Can we not talk about it?

24:00.902 --> 24:02.602
You're the one that wants
a house full of

24:02.702 --> 24:04.702
abominable pooing machines.

24:12.762 --> 24:13.802
Right.

24:13.862 --> 24:15.902
I don't know what I'm supposed
to say about it.

24:24.543 --> 24:26.603
What are you doing? Oly, stop!

24:26.703 --> 24:28.403
It's fine. Just say
what you need to say.

24:28.503 --> 24:30.503
I'm gonna do it with you, then.

24:36.384 --> 24:38.604
-Oly, I love you and I love J.
-(COUGHS)

24:38.704 --> 24:40.804
I don't know what's so wrong
with wanting more of that.

24:40.904 --> 24:42.684
Nothing, but it's
very unrealistic

24:42.784 --> 24:44.724
to expect that of me
right this minute.

24:44.824 --> 24:47.444
My frontal lobe hasn't even
fully developed yet.

24:47.544 --> 24:49.564
(COUGHS) Frontal lobe?

24:49.664 --> 24:51.525
(OLY COUGHS)

24:51.625 --> 24:53.205
I tell you that I love you

24:53.305 --> 24:54.685
and you talk about
your frontal lobe?

24:54.785 --> 24:56.725
That's what's making you
say all of this.

24:56.825 --> 24:58.285
Your brain doesn't know
what it's saying

24:58.385 --> 24:59.565
because being a teenager
is basically

24:59.665 --> 25:01.005
the same thing
as having brain damage.

25:01.105 --> 25:02.405
SANTI: Wow, OK.

25:02.505 --> 25:04.205
That's why teenage relationships
are less likely to last

25:04.305 --> 25:06.805
and why you think it's a good
idea to have a thousand babies.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.605
-I meant three.
-That might as well be a thousand.

25:08.705 --> 25:10.606
What is so wrong with wanting J
to have siblings, Oly?

25:10.706 --> 25:12.846
Nothing, but I'm not promising
on our first date

25:12.946 --> 25:14.946
to rip apart my body
all over again!

25:26.026 --> 25:28.027
Aren't J and I enough?

25:29.947 --> 25:31.947
Oly, of course...

25:34.187 --> 25:36.387
-Oly...
-I don't know if I can do it.

25:39.667 --> 25:42.027
-What do you mean?
-I think I've eaten too much.

25:43.027 --> 25:45.028
Oly...

25:54.868 --> 25:56.048
Hey!

25:56.148 --> 25:58.148
Hey, Oly!

25:59.308 --> 26:00.968
You just missed me
tap my debit card.

26:01.068 --> 26:03.229
Just then, that was
a big moment.

26:05.029 --> 26:07.029
Hey.

26:09.389 --> 26:11.829
You have no idea what it was
like in that ambulance.

26:14.029 --> 26:17.009
This...this thing
just suddenly came out of me!

26:17.109 --> 26:19.110
And there was so much blood!

26:20.230 --> 26:23.290
And I...I had no idea
what was happening!

26:23.390 --> 26:26.190
I really did think
that I was gonna die.

26:31.150 --> 26:32.770
Hey, Oly, I'm sorry.

26:32.870 --> 26:34.050
Oly.

26:34.150 --> 26:36.150
Hey.

26:38.111 --> 26:40.351
I don't think we've ever
talked about it.

26:42.391 --> 26:44.991
(SIGHS) I don't really wanna
talk about it.

26:47.551 --> 26:48.971
Can you look at me?

26:49.071 --> 26:53.371
I'm...I'm still the same person
that I was before we had J.

26:53.471 --> 26:55.812
-I know.
-I'm not some robo-oven.

26:55.912 --> 26:59.552
I still wanna do the same things
that I wanted to do before.

27:05.512 --> 27:07.512
Do you wanna do them with me?

27:08.832 --> 27:10.832
Yeah.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.013
Why?

27:13.113 --> 27:15.393
I don't know, it's just
sometimes it doesn't really...

27:16.513 --> 27:18.513
..feel that way.

27:21.593 --> 27:24.093
I thought that we would be
going wherever

27:24.193 --> 27:26.013
and doing whatever together.

27:26.113 --> 27:29.294
That's why you put
your drawings up, I thought.

27:29.394 --> 27:32.614
I put the drawings up
to make us some money.

27:32.714 --> 27:34.714
And you can draw anywhere?

27:37.914 --> 27:39.914
Well...

27:41.234 --> 27:43.934
..why are we arguing about
things that are so far away?

27:44.034 --> 27:46.354
I don't know. It's... Come here.

27:55.235 --> 27:58.095
How did our first date
end up like one of those sad,

27:58.195 --> 27:59.935
millions-of-years-of-marriage
date nights

28:00.035 --> 28:01.735
where people find out
they have nothing in common

28:01.835 --> 28:03.835
and get divorced?

28:04.956 --> 28:08.016
Well, you didn't watch me tap.

28:08.116 --> 28:10.116
-So...
-(LAUGHS)

28:16.156 --> 28:18.936
I promise that when my frontal
lobe is fully developed,

28:19.036 --> 28:21.796
I will commit to our future,
whatever it is.

28:23.317 --> 28:25.357
And then it will really
mean something.

28:27.477 --> 28:28.817
So...

28:28.917 --> 28:30.297
..do I have to wait till then

28:30.397 --> 28:32.697
to find out if you'll go
on a second date with me

28:32.797 --> 28:35.157
or is that too big of a step?

28:36.157 --> 28:37.937
Technically, my mum
set us up on this date,

28:38.037 --> 28:40.098
so it's actually
quite a huge step.

28:40.198 --> 28:42.198
Harsh.

28:43.878 --> 28:45.018
But fair.
