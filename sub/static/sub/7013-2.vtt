14:48.834 --> 14:51.428
Oh! That's right.

14:51.503 --> 14:56.497
Dad took away my car when I did
that really super-romantic thing.

14:59.010 --> 15:02.104
Well, I guess we were
only reunited just to be...

15:02.180 --> 15:04.205
ripped apart again.

15:05.984 --> 15:08.111
Like Romeo and Juliet.

15:09.955 --> 15:12.480
You know...

15:12.557 --> 15:15.822
why don't you take
the car this one time?

15:17.295 --> 15:19.263
It'll be our little secret.

15:19.331 --> 15:22.095
- ( Whispering ) Okay.
- ( Whispering ) Okay. Shh!

15:25.470 --> 15:27.563
Where do you think
you're going?

15:28.974 --> 15:31.909
Mom said I could.

15:31.977 --> 15:35.777
- <i>( Keys Jingle )</i>
- You just bought yourself another week, kiddo.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.975
Look, Dad, I need my car.

15:40.318 --> 15:42.582
Don't you remember when
you were in high school?

15:42.654 --> 15:44.747
I bet you had
some good times...

15:44.823 --> 15:48.088
driving around senior year
with your friends.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.654
My senior year,
I was driving a gunboat around Okinawa.

15:55.634 --> 16:01.163
And if you count
theJapanese snipers as my friends...

16:01.239 --> 16:03.673
then, yes,
I had some good times.

16:07.446 --> 16:09.380
You have to understand,
Eric.

16:09.448 --> 16:13.043
It's not that your father's
trying to be a bad guy.

16:13.118 --> 16:16.781
It's just that he's been
irreparably damaged by war.

16:20.025 --> 16:24.621
I'm just sick of you doing
whatever the hell you want.

16:24.696 --> 16:28.393
Your father and I feel that you're not
taking yourself seriously.

16:28.467 --> 16:30.401
- Hmm.
- <i>( Choir Vocalizing )</i>

16:30.469 --> 16:33.233
You are such
a talented young man.

16:33.305 --> 16:35.899
<i>( Continues )</i>

16:48.720 --> 16:51.416
- <i>( Ends )</i>
- Eric!

16:51.490 --> 16:54.288
Oh. Uh, yeah.

16:54.359 --> 16:56.520
Forget about the car.
I gotta go.

17:00.999 --> 17:05.265
<i>Oh, look how cute</i>
<i>in her little uniform.!</i>

17:09.441 --> 17:13.275
I'm gonna have to lock him in his room
and poke his eyes out.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.280
-  ( Stereo: Rock )
- Here's what I don't get about <i>Fantasy Island.</i>

17:19.351 --> 17:22.047
You know when you get off the plane,
and you see Mr. Roarke...

17:22.119 --> 17:24.111
and that little kid
in the white suit?

17:27.291 --> 17:30.887
Well, if it's me, I'm like,
''This is creepy,'' right?

17:30.962 --> 17:33.624
So I just grab
a free daiquiri...

17:33.698 --> 17:36.292
and I'm out of there.

17:39.137 --> 17:41.799
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

17:44.142 --> 17:46.702
( Sighs )
Grow up. It's just a uniform.

17:46.778 --> 17:49.269
- Sorry.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

17:49.347 --> 17:51.281
Oh!

17:51.349 --> 17:54.546
( Laughing )
Oh!

17:54.619 --> 17:58.419
Man, that was totally
worth waiting for.

17:58.490 --> 18:01.323
- I agree. Now we can go.
- <i>( Kelso Laughs )</i>

18:03.428 --> 18:05.362
How was your first day?

18:05.430 --> 18:08.524
Grim. This nun totally
spanked me with a ruler.

18:15.574 --> 18:19.943
Yet another reason
I wish I was a ruler.

18:22.514 --> 18:24.448
( Clears Throat )

18:24.516 --> 18:26.507
<i>( Door Closes )</i>

18:27.852 --> 18:29.945
- Wait a minute!
- Weird!

18:32.424 --> 18:37.225
Okay. Now you guys
are sitting together?

18:37.295 --> 18:40.753
Oh, my God.
You guys aren't just fooling around.

18:40.832 --> 18:43.232
You care about her.

18:43.301 --> 18:47.328
I do not.
She sickens me.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.905
No. No, no. I'm the one
who's sickened, okay?

18:51.977 --> 18:55.913
I'm not supposed to be seen
with scruffy guys like you.

18:55.981 --> 18:58.814
I date guys I can take out
in public.

19:01.219 --> 19:04.279
Yet you continue
with this abomination!

19:06.658 --> 19:10.025
You know, you guys
have to tell Kelso.

19:10.095 --> 19:14.657
Or we'll tell Kelso.
Shall we?

19:14.733 --> 19:16.701
Wait. No, no, no.
Okay, guys. Look.

19:16.768 --> 19:19.202
What if we just
break it off right now?

19:19.270 --> 19:21.238
- Then he never has to know.
- Really?

19:21.306 --> 19:23.968
Look, there's nothing to even break off,
so it's fine by me.

19:24.042 --> 19:26.510
Yes.
This is what I want to hear.

19:26.578 --> 19:29.775
It'll be like it never happened.

19:29.848 --> 19:33.750
Donna, come.
Let us leave this unholy thing behind.

19:35.387 --> 19:37.878
<i>( Door Closes )</i>

19:37.956 --> 19:40.356
Steven, do I really sicken you?

19:40.425 --> 19:42.552
No.

19:42.627 --> 19:46.119
I sicken me because you're supposed
to sicken me, but you don't.

19:49.968 --> 19:51.902
Well, I feel the same way.

19:51.970 --> 19:54.370
I mean, I like
how scruffy you are.

19:55.874 --> 19:57.865
Of course you do.

20:00.278 --> 20:03.509
Man, you know what? Screw it.
Let's just do what we want, okay?

20:05.250 --> 20:09.209
- Okay. What about Michael?
- Details, baby. Details.

20:12.023 --> 20:15.186
So, uh, how's that uniform
working out for you?

20:15.260 --> 20:17.922
Stop!

20:17.996 --> 20:22.558
Do you- Do you feel like a good girl
that just can't help being bad?

20:25.537 --> 20:27.937
Be bad, Donna.
( Whispering ) I won't tell.

20:31.342 --> 20:34.937
Eric, it's not funny.

20:35.013 --> 20:37.777
I actually have to go
to this school every day now.

20:37.849 --> 20:39.817
Without-Without you.

20:39.884 --> 20:42.751
Okay, so, you know what?

20:42.821 --> 20:45.813
We'll see each other nights
and weekends...

20:45.890 --> 20:50.793
and I'll come visit you at school.

20:50.862 --> 20:52.989
I mean, I still have a bike.

20:53.064 --> 20:56.158
Eric, it's, like, 1 0 miles away.

20:56.234 --> 20:59.863
Ten- So what?
These legs were made for pedalin'.

21:01.806 --> 21:03.797
Come on.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.809
- You've seen my thighs.
- Yeah.

21:08.213 --> 21:10.181
You're a good boyfriend.

21:11.382 --> 21:13.316
''You're a good boyfriend'' who?

21:14.786 --> 21:17.016
I'm not calling you
Principal Forman.

21:18.990 --> 21:22.118
Don't make me get
the ruler, young lady.

21:29.501 --> 21:32.629
Red can take Eric's car,
but he can have my car candy...

21:32.704 --> 21:34.865
when he pries it from
my cold, dead fingers.

21:36.708 --> 21:40.644
- You were right. Ten miles is nothing.
- ( Panting )

21:40.712 --> 21:44.113
( Chuckles ) Will you pick me up
from school every day?

21:44.182 --> 21:46.150
Sure.

21:46.217 --> 21:50.153
( Panting )

21:50.221 --> 21:54.624
Uh, which-which arm hurts
when you're about to have a heart attack?

21:54.692 --> 21:56.683
Help!
