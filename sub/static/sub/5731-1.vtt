TOWER HEIST (2011)

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:24.418 --> 01:25.460
Good morning, New York.

01:25.544 --> 01:29.088
Today we are
talking about cheese
until the sun comes up.

01:29.173 --> 01:31.466
Specifically,
bouchon cheese.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.261
I like to pair
this with a nice
'77 sauvignon blanc.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.806
It's perfect for
an intimate meal
or for a large gathering.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.322
You will never go wrong
with semi-soft cheeses.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.948
Let us go to Scott
in Crown Heights.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.533
He has been
wondering about Brie.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.660
NASDAQ dropped
its noisy effort

01:59.745 --> 02:01.871
to take over the New
York Stock Exchange.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.706
It slunk away
saying it became clear

02:03.791 --> 02:05.792
regulators wouldn't
approve a merger

02:05.876 --> 02:08.627
of the US's
two dominant
stock exchanges.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.756
I think we have
Barbara in the Bronx.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.133
She's got a question
about cheddar.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.885
Go ahead, Barbara.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.889
You can have my rook,
but I will take

02:20.724 --> 02:21.891
that.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.851
Boom.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.729
It seems investors may be
in for an equally wild ride.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.820
Get that bike around back.
Come on, empty the truck.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.367
Hey, it's the man
in the suit.
Hey.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.910
What are you doing
walking on my
side of the street?

02:40.994 --> 02:41.994
Very funny.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.746
Punk-ass bitches
walk on the other
side of the street.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.914
Same jokes as yesterday.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.916
Walk by me again
and I'm going to
whoop your ass.

03:24.288 --> 03:28.291
Good morning, Mr. Shaw.
You are looking
lean and mean today.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.042
This is why
I love you, Lester.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.711
You're the best
liar in New York.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.212
Morning, Mr. Shaw.
Hiya.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.630
Everything is set
for your dinner party.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.592
I'm sending up
some bouchon paired
with a '77 sauvignon blanc.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.801
Very nice.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.469
If you don't mind my saying,
are you sure you want

03:40.554 --> 03:42.889
Secretary Lowe
and Janet Ramsey
at the party together?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.348
They were mentioned
again on Page Six.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.184
Jesus! I totally forgot
they were screwing.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.936
Yeah.
Nice save, Josh.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.229
What the hell
would I do without you?

03:50.689 --> 03:51.939
You would have to
read the Post yourself.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.649
No, I'm serious.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.735
I am kicking
the tires on
a couple deals.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.320
I might buy a hotel
in Saint Bart's.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.738
I'm looking for a GM.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.323
I'm going to try
and steal you away.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.158
If I could bring Lester,
we might have a deal.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.160
Okay, deal.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.621
All right.
Have a good one.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.164
Josh, one more thing.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.290
What is that, sir?

04:09.374 --> 04:10.875
Checkmate.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.214
You got a security
report for me?

04:18.300 --> 04:21.761
Not much, Mr. K.
A car alarm, two homeless
and a really loud dog.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.387
Good morning, Josh.
Hey, Rose.

04:23.472 --> 04:24.639
How was your weekend?

04:24.723 --> 04:26.891
Good. I was here.
We steam-cleaned
the garage,

04:26.975 --> 04:28.643
had some killer take-out
from Punjab Palace.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.394
You are a wild man.
That's me.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.771
Mr. K.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.105
Hey, Odessa.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.608
My work visa's
about to expire.
You must find me a husband.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.361
Okay. Can I have
my bagel first?

04:38.445 --> 04:41.447
I need a man before
these pricks throw me
out of the country.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.200
All right,
and what about Manuel?
He's a catch.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.203
I tried.
He couldn't handle me.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.582
Okay. Rose,
don't write that down.

04:51.667 --> 04:52.917
Morning.
Morning, Kwan.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.045
We have birthdays
in 3714 and 4399.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.965
The Jameson twins
like the cupcakes
from Magnolia,

04:59.049 --> 05:02.468
Mr. Causwell likes
the hot fudge sundae
at Sardi's.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.637
And Mrs. Hightower
landed three days early

05:04.721 --> 05:06.138
from Cairo,
be here in an hour.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.264
Does Mr. Hightower know?

05:07.349 --> 05:09.225
Josh, a word,
right now.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.060
Yes, sir, Mr. Simon.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.356
Where's Charlie?
I got an empty
concierge desk.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.066
I think he's checking
on Mrs. Cronan.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.902
Now that's bullshit!
Mrs. Cronan is at
physical therapy.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.779
He has got three minutes.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.366
...can only be convicted
if the prosecution
proves all the...

05:25.450 --> 05:26.534
Miss lovenko.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.703
Holy shit! What?

05:28.870 --> 05:30.079
We do this thing,
you and I,

05:30.163 --> 05:31.622
where you pretend
not to study
for the bar exam

05:31.707 --> 05:32.790
and I pretend
not to notice.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.167
I'm sorry, I don't
know what you're
talking about, sir.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.711
See, we're doing it.
Doing what?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.421
Right now,
we're doing the thing,
where you pretend not...

05:38.505 --> 05:39.505
No.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.632
I know the exam is
coming up this week,
so study in my office

05:41.717 --> 05:43.342
during your
lunch break, okay?
Because I never use it.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.803
Okay, but I'm not studying,
so it would not
make much sense.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.139
Wait. Shh! Hear that?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.391
Someone is buzzing.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.977
Hey, shush!

05:53.061 --> 05:54.103
Everybody, shush!

05:55.397 --> 05:56.397
Who's buzzing?

05:57.399 --> 05:58.649
I hear it.
It's faint,

05:58.942 --> 06:00.985
it's muffled,
but I hear it.
Fess up!

06:01.069 --> 06:02.194
Who's buzzing?
Come on!

06:02.279 --> 06:03.446
Who the hell is buzzing?

06:03.530 --> 06:06.032
It's me, my bad.
I had it on vibrate.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.367
Josh, this is
Enrique Dev'Reaux.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.785
He's our new
elevator operator.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.870
I didn't hire you.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.039
He's a quarter Cherokee,
you know we need an Indian.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.540
So give him a shot.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.293
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Kovaks.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.503
I've spent
the last three years
working at the BK,

06:19.588 --> 06:21.005
and I'm ready for
the big leagues.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.090
BK? What is that?
A building downtown?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.217
No, it's a Burger King
in Times Square.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.095
All right.
Walk with me,
Mr. Dev'Reaux.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.182
The average
apartment at The Tower
costs $5.6 million.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.601
It's the most
expensive real estate
in North America.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.103
We have the best views,
the most advanced
security system,

06:36.188 --> 06:39.857
keyless entry,
24-hour video
vibration detection.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.442
But you know
what these people
are really buying?

06:42.694 --> 06:43.819
White neighbors?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.321
Us. The staff.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.199
They pay for our full
and undivided attention
seven days a week.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.201
So there's no
cell phones, iPhones,

06:50.285 --> 06:51.911
BlackBerries,
texting, tweeting...

06:51.995 --> 06:54.121
They had a rule at the BK,
no sex in the storage room.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.539
Same as your
phone rule, right?

06:56.291 --> 06:59.126
No, not the same,
because your dick

06:59.211 --> 07:00.669
has to come with you
to work, Mr. Dev'Reaux,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.713
but your phone
can stay at home.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.091
So don't hide it
in your pocket
or tuck it into your sock,

07:05.175 --> 07:06.926
don't tape it
under your balls
or stick it up your ass,

07:07.010 --> 07:08.928
because, eventually,
I will find it.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.014
They never checked
my balls at the BK.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.685
Sir, you can call me
"Enrique" or "Lil' Disco"
or "The Puerto Rican Mohican,"

07:16.770 --> 07:17.895
that's my hip-hop name.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.109
Morning,
Judge Ramos.
How did you do?

07:23.193 --> 07:25.069
I ran the Reservoir,
15 flat.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.153
Nice.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.571
Where's Charlie?
I need my cigars.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.532
I think he took
Mrs. Cronan
to physical therapy.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.741
I'll bring them up
the second he gets here.

07:30.826 --> 07:31.867
Thank you.

07:31.952 --> 07:32.993
Hey, Lester.
Good morning, Lester.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.078
Hi, Lester.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.872
What's invisible
and smells like worms?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.457
Bird farts.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.084
We've heard
that one before.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.460
Have a great day
at school.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.087
Morning,
Mr. Hightower.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.296
Ma'am.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.259
Sir, that package
you ordered from Cairo
arrived three days early.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.593
Hmm.
Yeah.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.428
It's on its way
from the airport
right now.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.596
Josh, can you
have the chauffeur

07:52.681 --> 07:53.848
pick us up
at the back, please?

07:53.932 --> 07:55.516
Already done.
Thank you.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.268
Darling, let's go.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.982
That guy's daughter
looks like a prostitute.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.692
We're all about
discretion here,
Mr. Dev'Reaux.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.361
Right, right.
How do you guys
split up the tips?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.238
We don't. We never
take tips at The Tower.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.573
No, I don't really
want to talk
about it right now.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.241
Charlie.
Sasha!

08:12.576 --> 08:14.702
Your brother's coming,
I'm at work and I can't
talk right now.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.663
You're 20 minutes late!
Where are Judge Ramos' cigars?

08:17.747 --> 08:18.789
Right here.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.000
Josh, I'm freaking out.

08:21.543 --> 08:22.626
Can I help you?

08:22.711 --> 08:23.752
Go.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.837
What?

08:24.921 --> 08:27.173
We just went to the OB/GYN,
the baby is in
the third trimester,

08:27.257 --> 08:29.675
its head is six inches wide,
your sister has a tiny vagina.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.385
Everyone tells me
to stop worrying.
I said, "Stop worrying?"

08:32.470 --> 08:34.013
In labor its head is
going to get crushed

08:34.097 --> 08:35.806
or it's going to blow
out your sister's vagina.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.099
Don't say the "V"
word in the lobby.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.183
I called your
Uncle Marty.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.312
He said all
the women in your family
have teeny tiny vaginas.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.606
I've been covering
your ass all week.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.857
Simon is
breathing down my neck.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.901
What are you doing?
I'm worried.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.320
Did you hear
what I was saying?
Simon is going to fire you.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.448
Simon is not going
to fire me today.
I got the red flowers.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.532
Red flowers?

08:53.617 --> 08:54.658
Yeah, it's
Chinese New Year.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.076
Mrs. Jin will be
down here any second.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.996
It's crucial
the first thing she hears
be something positive.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.206
Her entire year
depends on it.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.249
Mrs. Jin.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.636
Happy New Year.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.809
Did you see that smile?

09:23.438 --> 09:24.396
Wanted to see me?

09:24.481 --> 09:25.606
Yeah.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.401
Fitzhugh is
refusing to leave.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.237
We've never had
a forced eviction
at The Tower.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.572
If they drag Mr. Fitzhugh
and his family
into the street,

09:33.657 --> 09:34.740
it's bad for all of us.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.158
Why don't you
talk to him?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.451
This is your
responsibility, Josh.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.286
The bank comes
in the morning.
Get him out.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.714
Mr. Fitzhugh,
it's Josh Kovaks, sir.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.182
Good morning, Josh.
Are you alone?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.267
Yeah.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.486
Hey, did you see what
the market did today?

10:12.570 --> 10:16.282
Went up 106 points.
Ask me why it did that?

10:16.366 --> 10:17.366
Why?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.660
I don't know,
but I used to know.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.412
That's why they hired
me at Merrill Lynch.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.624
Mr. Fitzhugh,
you know this apartment
is now owned by the bank.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.251
They'd like you to
vacate immediately.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.128
We told the kids
that we were turning
the apartment

10:29.212 --> 10:30.879
into a park.
Going green.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.798
That's how we explained
all the furniture

10:32.882 --> 10:35.259
being sold
and the tents
in the living room.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.846
Luckily, my children
aren't very bright,
so they bought it.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.890
But they have smart friends
and those friends
are catching on.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.310
Sir, the bank will be
here tomorrow morning.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.688
I went to Yale
20 years ago,
and now I'm a squatter.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.401
Can't wait for their reunion.
"Hello, nice to see you.
I squat."

10:53.320 --> 10:54.486
What about family?

10:54.696 --> 10:58.324
No,
I invested all their money.
They won't return my calls.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.618
I'd sleep in my car,
but they repossessed
it three months ago.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.245
So, you see,
I have to stay here,

11:03.955 --> 11:05.789
because we have
nowhere else to go.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.542
It's illegal
for you to be here.
You're committing a crime.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.002
I understand that.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.426
But we might be
doing some elevator
maintenance tomorrow.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.306
I'm thinking
that the elevators
will be shut down

11:23.308 --> 11:27.478
and those people from
the bank will just have
to come back another time.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.942
Because,
it's like you go down one.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.448
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.201
Mr. Shaw,
I see you met
Mr. Dev'Reaux.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.245
This guy owns his own
island with jet skis.
How cool is that?

11:45.330 --> 11:46.914
He's our probationary
elevator operator.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.832
He's still very early
in the interview process.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.335
Why don't we finish
the job interview
right now, Josh?

11:51.669 --> 11:54.129
Suppose I ask
you to pick me up
a cheeseburger,

11:54.214 --> 11:55.506
Enrique,
what would you say?

11:55.590 --> 11:57.007
How do you
like it cooked?

11:57.092 --> 11:59.593
The thing is,
I like a certain kind
of Brie on my burger,

11:59.677 --> 12:02.221
and they only sell it
at Danny's Cheese Shop
downtown.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.847
I'm on my way.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.475
And the beef has
to be grass-fed.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.602
The best butcher shop
in New York is on
Bleecker Street, sir.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.230
Josh, hire him.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.025
Yes, that was
my gut, sir.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.151
And, Enrique,
one other thing.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.404
I like to
get my own burgers
whenever possible.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.697
I may have my own
private island in Belize,

12:20.782 --> 12:23.700
but deep down
I'm just an Astoria
boy like Josh here.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.035
We come from
the same neighborhood.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.287
That's right,
PS 104.
Go Lions!

12:27.580 --> 12:31.750
My first real job
was shoveling horseshit
at Aqueduct Racetrack.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.544
Don't you
ever let me
forget it.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.878
I won't, sir.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.342
All right, go downstairs
and get a nametag from Rose.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.344
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.810
Why don't we hit
it tonight, Josh?
Raise some hell.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.979
We have to be back
here in nine hours.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.065
Remember that time
you danced on that bar
in Times Square?

12:55.150 --> 12:56.442
I almost fainted.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.902
That's a drunken dream
you had six years ago.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.156
You were shaking
your ass up there
like Tina Turner.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.450
Running half naked
on Broadway

13:04.534 --> 13:07.661
telling tourists
you were Mustafa
from The Lion King.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.163
That's ridiculous.
It never happened.

13:09.247 --> 13:13.584
I was waiting to tell you.
This is going to be my
last year at The Tower.

13:13.668 --> 13:14.668
What?

13:14.752 --> 13:16.920
In a few months,
I'm headed to San Diego

13:17.005 --> 13:18.672
to spend a little
time with Lorraine.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.884
I might even cruise
around the world with
all the other old farts.

13:22.719 --> 13:23.802
Wow.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.556
That's great.
That's really great.
I'm going to miss you.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.558
I'll be thinking
about you, Josh.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.976
Here's your bus.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.312
Be thinking about
how you danced
on that bar.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.314
Yeah!
I got it all up here.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.982
I don't know
where you got that.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.151
Circle of life, Josh.
Circle of life!

13:46.117 --> 13:48.619
FEMALE RADIO HOST:
Not many of you kill your
own Thanksgiving turkey,

13:48.703 --> 13:50.287
but you might
want to consider it.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.831
Shit, Rita,
get your ass back in here!

13:52.916 --> 13:53.999
I ain't going to be
chasing you all around.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.167
Goodbye, Slide!

13:55.251 --> 13:56.919
Hey, hey, Rita, come on now,
it's 5:30 in the morning.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.504
Not little
shit like this.
Come on now.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.130
I told you,
I don't even know
nobody named Maria.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.882
Yeah, well,
she sure as shit
knows you, Slide!

14:01.966 --> 14:02.966
It was a wrong number.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.135
Then why did she ask
for you, stupid? Why?

14:05.220 --> 14:06.929
It was a wrong number!
I just...

14:08.097 --> 14:09.515
I don't know what
you are saying, bitch!

14:17.398 --> 14:19.775
Lester, it's 9: 15.
Why is Mr. Shaw's
car still here?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.859
Maybe he's sick.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.198
That black sedan
has been parked there
for two days.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.866
Why no boot or ticket?

14:27.951 --> 14:29.243
I called
the cops twice.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.544
Do you remember
that morning robbery

14:38.628 --> 14:40.963
at the International
last year?

14:41.047 --> 14:44.591
I want you to
slowly lock the door
and clear the lobby.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.760
Stay calm.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.433
Lock it down.
Code Black on all
doors and elevators.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.269
Repeat, Code Black.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.812
What's Code Black?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.398
Are you serious?
We talked about it at
the meeting last month.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.941
Let me see the outside
of the building.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.067
I think we're
about to be robbed.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.152
There were four guys
out there with guns.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.487
Where did they go?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.155
Let me see the garage.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.325
Why is Stillman here?
Laundry pick-up was yesterday.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.244
Mr. Shaw asked us
to call him.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.162
Someone spilled wine
on his tablecloth.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.206
He's bringing it
down right now.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.667
Wait a second.
Those are not
the Stillman brothers.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.338
Oh, my God,
they're taking Shaw.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.923
This isn't a robbery,
it's a kidnapping.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.633
It's a kidnapping!
Call 911!

15:26.718 --> 15:27.718
Yes, sir.

15:27.802 --> 15:28.844
Code Black, Manuel!
Code Black!

15:28.928 --> 15:29.928
What's Code Black?

15:31.639 --> 15:33.307
Hey! Whoa!
Whoa!

15:33.391 --> 15:35.892
Hey! Stop!

15:39.981 --> 15:41.148
Shoot at the tires!

15:41.232 --> 15:42.608
I only have my Taser!

15:50.700 --> 15:51.700
Hey, stop!

16:07.634 --> 16:08.967
Watch out!

16:12.347 --> 16:14.473
MALE FBI AGENT 1:
Move in! Move in!
Move in!

16:15.308 --> 16:16.308
Don't move.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.894
MALE FBI AGENT 2:
Get your hands
in the air!

16:21.439 --> 16:23.523
FBI, show me your hands.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.651
MALE FBI AGENT 2:
Let's go.
Okay, all right.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.069
MALE FBI AGENT 2:
Put them behind your back!

16:27.153 --> 16:28.153
Take it easy.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.739
No, get off him!
He's the victim!

16:30.907 --> 16:32.783
That's Arthur Shaw!
He lives in The Tower.

16:32.867 --> 16:35.243
He was bringing
his laundry down.
They kidnapped him.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.455
This was not a kidnapping,
it was an attempt to flee.

16:38.748 --> 16:39.748
What?

16:40.917 --> 16:43.085
Arrest him
and get him
out of here.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.463
Josh, do me a favor,
turn off the heater
and cover the pool.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.048
I hate to waste money.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.014
MALE RADIO HOST:
Wall Street kingpin
Arthur Shaw,

16:56.099 --> 16:58.725
number 138 on
the Forbes 400 last year,

16:58.810 --> 17:02.145
was arrested today
in Manhattan while
trying to flee the city.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.314
Sources have confirmed
that he'll be charged

17:04.398 --> 17:06.358
with several counts
of securities fraud

17:06.442 --> 17:09.819
and an immediate asset freeze
of Mr. Shaw's holdings
has been ordered.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.155
Shaw's lawyers
have called the arrest

17:12.240 --> 17:14.324
"another example
of the Wall Street
witch-hunt,"

17:14.409 --> 17:16.617
but sources at the SEC
believe the fraud

17:16.703 --> 17:19.413
in this case could be
of epic proportions.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.127
In this country
you're innocent
until proven guilty,

17:25.211 --> 17:28.505
so no matter what
you hear about Mr. Shaw
being a liar and a cheat,

17:28.589 --> 17:31.258
or his entire business
being some sort
of elaborate scam,

17:31.342 --> 17:32.843
we simply don't
know the truth yet.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.761
I've got shoes
to polish, Mr. K.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.388
What does this
got to do with us?

17:37.473 --> 17:40.225
For the last six years,
Mr. Shaw was on
the board of The Tower.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.644
So we have to find
a new board member?

17:42.854 --> 17:44.104
No.

17:44.188 --> 17:47.315
Several years ago at
one of the meetings,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.151
he was asked to
do a favor for us.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.111
He was asked to manage
all of your pensions.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.195
Pensions?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.488
And he did.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.532
He took us on
even though it was
a small account.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.992
He agreed to handle it.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.994
Who asked him
to do that?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.331
I did, Rose.
I asked him.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.211
Mr. K, what's left
in the pension?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.173
Kwan, all this just happened,
so there's no way of knowing,

18:11.257 --> 18:12.758
and by the way,
this could be a mistake.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.177
How much, Josh?
Tell us.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.514
Right now, they're
saying that anyone who

18:19.599 --> 18:21.516
invested with Mr. Shaw
has been defrauded,

18:21.851 --> 18:24.519
and that
more than likely,
it's all gone.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.271
There is no pension.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.898
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.399
How did this happen?

18:29.817 --> 18:30.984
The guy is the best
in New York

18:31.068 --> 18:32.903
and he promised
he could triple
our portfolio.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.029
So they're going
to get our money?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.739
The guy had billions
of dollars, right?

18:35.823 --> 18:36.907
Of course,
it's just a matter of time.

18:36.991 --> 18:41.620
So we have to stay
patient and be positive,
because it has to be there.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.663
I heard on the news
when they arrested Shaw

18:43.748 --> 18:45.707
that he only had $600
in his checking account.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.003
Look, some of you
may need some time
to process this.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.129
If anyone wants
to go home,

18:51.214 --> 18:53.757
I will call in a temp crew
for the rest of the day.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.051
I'm sure that
this will all be
cleared up tomorrow.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.761
Can I ask you
something, Mr. K?

18:57.845 --> 18:58.845
Yeah.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.597
Did he get your money, too?

19:01.182 --> 19:03.058
Yeah, Odessa.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.560
For the record,

19:05.645 --> 19:08.563
I never asked anyone
to triple my portfolio.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.403
FEMALE REPORTER:
Just an hour ago,

19:15.488 --> 19:19.491
a federal judge
released Arthur Shaw
on $10 million bail,

19:19.575 --> 19:23.537
on condition he
remain under house arrest
at his penthouse apartment

19:23.621 --> 19:25.705
on Central Park West.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.998
Mr. Shaw, I need
a statement from you.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.041
You need to back off.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.377
Can I get a comment
please, Mr. Shaw?

19:30.461 --> 19:32.712
You need to back off.
Excuse me.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.216
Here!
Over here! Come on, Shaw!
Right here! Shaw!

19:36.300 --> 19:38.426
MALE PHOTOGRAPHER:
Shaw, can we get a picture?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.137
Over here, Mr. Shaw!

19:46.102 --> 19:48.061
We're taking Shaw
and his attorney
up to the penthouse.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.021
I need Mr. Shaw's
personal security code.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.898
24719.

19:51.983 --> 19:56.486
That was my street address
on Steinway Boulevard
in Astoria when I was a kid.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.993
My client would like
access to the gym on 43.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.246
Even serial killers
get 15 minutes
of exercise a day.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.290
He has my permission
to jump out the window.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.668
The rules of Mr. Shaw's
house arrest are simple.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.921
Kovaks, no visitors
without prior permission
from the FBI.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.716
All incoming and
outgoing mail gets
vetted by my office.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.509
All food deliveries,
packages,

20:19.594 --> 20:22.387
cleaning, repairs,
all that has to be cleared
by the agent on duty.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.598
You tell your staff
that this penthouse is now

20:24.682 --> 20:27.100
a maximum security prison
and it will be
guarded as such.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.644
The FBI is in control
of the elevator
and this floor.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.981
What the hell is this?

20:33.900 --> 20:38.778
Agent Denham,
that is a 1963
Ferrari 250 GT Lusso,

20:38.863 --> 20:42.282
owned and raced
by the coolest cat
who ever lived, Steve McQueen.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.284
This was his baby,

20:44.368 --> 20:45.744
and now it's my baby.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.956
You got Steve McQueen's car
parked in your living room?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.250
And here I thought
you were an asshole.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.127
I paid a million
for it 10 years ago.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.129
I wouldn't sell it
for 10 times that.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.590
We're 65 stories up.
How do we get it
out of here?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.133
You don't.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.344
This car was taken
apart piece by piece

21:02.428 --> 21:03.887
and reassembled
inside this room.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.097
This car will eventually
be sold at auction

21:06.182 --> 21:07.724
with the rest of
your belongings.

21:07.808 --> 21:11.061
Only if I'm guilty,
Agent Denham,
which I'm not.

21:13.731 --> 21:17.025
If you leave this
apartment for any reason
without my say so,

21:17.109 --> 21:18.902
and you'll be
remanded into
federal custody

21:18.986 --> 21:21.196
and forfeit
$10 million bail.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.698
You have yourself
a nice day, Mr. Shaw.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.326
Kovaks, will you
come with me?

21:26.410 --> 21:27.827
Josh, do me
a favor, will you?

21:28.579 --> 21:29.746
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.290
Make sure you handle
all my food deliveries.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.959
You're smart enough
to know I'm innocent.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.753
I don't want the help
to spit in my coffee.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.005
They wouldn't do that, sir.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.924
Yeah, but you
get it, right?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.051
Do it as a favor to me.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.305
Sorry, we don't
accept tips
at The Tower.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.809
Right, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I forget
the rules.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.567
CLAIRE:
Why did you let him
get away with that?

22:00.111 --> 22:03.154
When he made that crack
about the help
spitting in his coffee.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.824
You wanted to hurt him.
Hell, I wanted to hurt him.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.994
Sometimes residents
say things they don't mean.
It doesn't faze me.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.745
Either that or
you got no balls.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.871
What?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.790
I'm out of line.
I'm sorry.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.333
I have balls,
all right.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.043
I'm sure you got
big balls. Whatever.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.462
I don't have to
defend my balls to you.

22:19.547 --> 22:22.340
I'm just saying
the guy stole from everyone
who works in your building

22:22.425 --> 22:23.842
and it looked like you
gave him a free pass.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.802
Maybe next time I'll
rip out his larynx,

22:25.886 --> 22:28.805
but today I chose to
do my job as manager
of this building.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.182
Okay, my mistake, Kovaks.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.727
Just that most
guys from your block
in Astoria

22:33.811 --> 22:34.894
can't control
themselves.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.313
And most girls
from Forest Hills
don't end up in the FBI.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.690
That's where
you're from, right?

22:46.907 --> 22:48.033
Here.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.619
This is where most
white-collar crimes
are solved, the garbage.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.872
When do you think
you will be getting
the money back?

22:53.956 --> 22:56.124
I'm not really
allowed to discuss
the case with you.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.126
But you're allowed
to clothesline me?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.878
I was apprehending
a fugitive.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.172
He's only a fugitive
if he's guilty, right?

23:02.256 --> 23:03.339
Oh!

23:03.424 --> 23:04.716
Aren't you
the loyal friend?

23:05.301 --> 23:06.509
I never said
we were friends.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.137
You play chess together,

23:09.221 --> 23:11.139
you're the one
who asked him to
invest the pension.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.517
I get his mail,
I open his car door,

23:14.602 --> 23:16.644
I buy his cheese.
We're not friends.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.354
Let me ask you something,
Kovaks.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.607
If he's innocent,
where's the money?

23:20.691 --> 23:21.775
How should I know?

23:22.526 --> 23:25.695
The same way you knew
I was from Forest Hills.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.030
You pay attention.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.036
I just want to know
what I'm supposed
to tell my staff.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.289
Is that too much to ask?

23:37.374 --> 23:39.209
Tell them he's guilty.

23:41.504 --> 23:42.545
MALE COP 1:
Get on the car!

23:42.630 --> 23:43.963
MALE COP 2:
Hey! Hey, hey!

23:44.048 --> 23:45.965
Come on,
put your hands
behind your back!

23:46.050 --> 23:47.425
Come on, man,
what's this about?

23:47.510 --> 23:49.469
This is bullshit! Shit!
That's police brutality, yo!

23:49.720 --> 23:51.054
Come on now.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.555
Man in the suit,
you seeing this shit?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.099
You're my witness.
Take a cell phone picture.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.642
Take a picture, man.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.393
No, my cell phone
doesn't have a camera.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.896
If you see Rita,
tell her I said
to call her brother.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.648
Rita?
Yeah, her brother's
a bail bondsman.

24:01.732 --> 24:02.816
Tell her I said
to use that money

24:02.900 --> 24:04.526
I gave her to get
her teeth fixed.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.486
Come on now,
what you got to be
pushing me like that?

24:12.993 --> 24:17.205
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next Brooklyn bound

24:17.289 --> 24:20.125
local train is now arriving.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.919
Please step away
from the platform edge,

24:23.003 --> 24:27.382
especially when
trains are entering
and leaving the station.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.486
Hello.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.823
WOMAN ON PA:
Dr. Carr, dial 118, please.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.536
Hey, what happened?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.788
Lester tried to step
in front of
a subway train tonight.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.666
An off-duty
traffic cop was there

25:01.750 --> 25:03.334
and pulled him back
at the last second.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.211
They have him on
a 48-hour hold.

25:05.296 --> 25:06.337
Where is he?

25:20.644 --> 25:22.979
If you wanted a sick day,
all you had to do was ask.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.149
Seriously,
I need you
back at work.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.776
I'm going to
tell the doctor
somebody pushed you.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.528
It was a misunderstanding,
okay?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.616
I gave it to him, Josh.
All my money.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.743
I asked him to
invest it for me.

25:37.745 --> 25:38.995
Shaw?
Yeah.

25:39.288 --> 25:43.249
A couple of months ago,
I gave him everything I had,
my life savings.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.834
Six years
working the back door

25:44.919 --> 25:46.961
at the Waldorf,
nine at the Carlyle,

25:47.046 --> 25:49.631
three at the Pierre,
11 with you at The Tower.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.884
That's 29 years
of opening doors.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.387
$73,000 and change,
and I gave him every penny.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.099
In a few months
I won't have
money for rent.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.602
I can't retire now.

26:03.312 --> 26:07.357
All those years
of opening doors,
year after year.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.987
Truth is, people can
open their own doors.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.950
Not the way you do it.

26:19.119 --> 26:22.205
Lester, he's going
to pay you back
every penny.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.374
I promise.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.628
Josh, please calm down.

26:28.712 --> 26:29.712
Hold the elevator.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.339
You can't go up there.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.091
You're acting
like a vigilante.
Move your hand.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.425
I won't move my hand.
Move your hand!

26:34.510 --> 26:35.885
Relax. You're not
using your head.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.303
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, Josh.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.429
Hey.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.640
So, they're
evicting me
this morning.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.725
My wife already
took the kids,
wants a divorce.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.477
So, if you need me,
I'll be living in this box.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.938
Can I ask you a question?
You're a Wall Street guy.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.773
When did Shaw realize
that it was over for him?

26:49.858 --> 26:51.651
Ten months,
maybe a year.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.987
I heard he was
interviewing lawyers
over the summer.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.364
So if he took
someone's money
a few months ago?

26:56.740 --> 26:59.033
Probably needed the cash
to keep up appearances.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.620
Throw his famous
Labor Day party
at the beach.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.123
At a certain point,
it isn't about
securities fraud,

27:05.207 --> 27:06.207
it's about catering.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.922
Drop Mr. Fitzhugh on 59.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.215
I'm going to the penthouse.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.384
Wow! This is
going to be good.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.264
Don't get up.
Whoa! Where do you
think you're going?

27:21.348 --> 27:22.974
We're just going
to get the trash.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.934
And the breakfast order.

27:25.019 --> 27:26.269
Go ahead.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.189
Takes a village.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.489
Good morning,
Josh, Charlie, Enrique.
How are you doing?

27:38.574 --> 27:40.742
How was your Labor
Day party this year,
Mr. Shaw?

27:40.826 --> 27:43.369
Must have been something, huh?
What did you serve? Crab legs?

27:43.454 --> 27:44.912
Surf and turf?

27:44.997 --> 27:48.207
I've always tried
to extend you a certain courtesy,

27:48.292 --> 27:49.792
but this tone
you're using...

27:49.877 --> 27:51.919
What tone? Who gives
a shit about my tone?

27:52.671 --> 27:54.255
What are you,
some kind of tone master?

27:54.965 --> 27:56.883
Josh, come on.
I'm going to ask
you one time, okay?

27:56.967 --> 27:58.760
So you better
think really hard.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.428
Why did you take
Lester's money?

28:04.933 --> 28:09.437
He came to me,
he asked me to invest
and I did. It was a favor.

28:09.563 --> 28:13.107
Mm-hmm.
$73,000? A favor?
Everything he had.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.901
Did Lester ask you
to come up here?

28:14.985 --> 28:16.235
Mr. Shaw,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.946
a few hours ago,
Lester stepped
in front of a subway train.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.115
Oh, Jesus.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.953
Here we go.
What are you doing?

28:26.955 --> 28:29.540
Josh,
you need to listen to me.
The FBI is lying to you.

28:29.625 --> 28:30.666
Josh, put down the club.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.461
Christ's sake,
don't do anything
you can't undo.

28:35.089 --> 28:38.091
Investing money is a gamble.
It doesn't always pay off.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.051
Mr. Shaw, do you care?

28:40.135 --> 28:41.469
Josh, come on.
No, really.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.930
Do you feel any
responsibility for what
happened to Lester?

28:44.223 --> 28:45.223
Of course I feel badly.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.850
I had no idea
he was going to
lose everything.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.311
Lester has been
a part of my life
for over a decade.

28:52.189 --> 28:55.233
Then why haven't you
asked me whether
he's alive or dead?

28:58.320 --> 29:00.071
Josh, this car
is irreplaceable!

29:00.155 --> 29:01.823
Not like doormen!

29:02.199 --> 29:04.325
They make new ones
of those all the time.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.829
Must be 50 new doormen
coming off the line
in Michigan right now!

29:08.414 --> 29:09.705
God damn it! Stop it!

29:09.790 --> 29:11.582
Want some Brie
with your burger?
Here you go.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.126
Josh, don't!
Shh!

29:13.210 --> 29:14.961
Want me to come
work for you, huh?

29:15.045 --> 29:16.462
Want to steal
me away to
Saint Bart's?

29:16.713 --> 29:19.048
Come on, let's go!
I'm ready to rock!

29:19.383 --> 29:21.384
Mr. Kovaks, let me have
a swing at that shit!

29:21.468 --> 29:24.011
No! Nobody touches
this car but me.

29:24.555 --> 29:27.348
You think Steve McQueen
is the coolest cat
that ever lived?

29:27.641 --> 29:30.518
Guess what?
Today, Steve McQueen
is my little bitch.

29:34.523 --> 29:35.565
Ooh!

29:36.358 --> 29:37.358
Ah!

29:38.026 --> 29:39.026
Oh!

29:40.028 --> 29:41.446
Whoops.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.202
Don't worry,
I'll have the help
come clean that up.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.371
Let's go.

29:50.914 --> 29:53.541
Josh, aren't you
forgetting something?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.210
My breakfast order.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.925
SIMON:
Do you understand
the shit-storm

30:03.010 --> 30:04.260
that can be brought
down on this building?

30:04.344 --> 30:07.180
Shaw's lawyer will
shove harassment,
destruction of property

30:07.264 --> 30:09.640
and civil rights charges
right down our throats!

30:09.725 --> 30:11.184
Now, I don't care
what Shaw did

30:11.268 --> 30:12.977
or how much money
he's accused of stealing.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.396
And you know damn well
I got murdered by that
son of a bitch!

30:15.481 --> 30:17.815
But a line has been crossed,
and a gang of vigilantes

30:17.900 --> 30:19.525
will not be tolerated
at The Tower.

30:19.610 --> 30:20.735
You're all fired.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.362
Hey, wait, hold on.
Mr. Simon, they had
nothing to do with this.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.572
They just
followed me up there.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.656
I don't give a shit!

30:25.741 --> 30:27.575
Mr. Simon, wait a minute,
my wife is eight
months pregnant.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.827
You should have
thought of that before you
walked in that apartment.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.037
We went up there
for Lester!

30:31.121 --> 30:32.872
Lester's job is
waiting for him
when he gets out.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.042
Meanwhile, the rest of you,
I want you out of
the building right now.

30:54.937 --> 30:59.899
Um, the carpet cleaners
are coming tomorrow,
they start on 44. Okay?

30:59.983 --> 31:01.442
Bye, Joshie.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.028
Good luck with the bar.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.781
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:11.787 --> 31:15.581
All right.
Let's go, everyone.
Back to work, okay?

31:21.964 --> 31:23.631
Hey, Charlie, wait!

31:23.715 --> 31:25.383
Wait. I'll call Sasha,
all right.

31:25.467 --> 31:26.467
I'll tell her you
tried to stop me.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.719
Please,
don't do me any favors.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.221
And, Josh,
don't pretend to care now,

31:30.305 --> 31:31.931
I know you always
wanted to fire me.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.392
That's because you
stink at this job.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.019
So I stink? I stink?
Yeah.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.522
The guy who made Mrs. Jin
smile on Chinese New Year?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.482
Mrs. Jin is Korean.

31:41.942 --> 31:42.900
She's what?

31:42.985 --> 31:44.068
That's why she was smiling.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.653
She's not Chinese,
she's Korean.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.446
And you believed her?

31:47.531 --> 31:49.282
Yeah, she's Korean.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.493
All right, Josh,
maybe she's Korean.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.328
Why are you whispering?
She is Korean.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.831
What's important is
that she appreciated
the gesture I made,

31:56.915 --> 31:58.958
and that's more
than I can say
for some people.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.836
Thanks for getting me fired.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.072
Hey.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.532
Hey. Thank you
for coming down.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.201
Yeah, no problem.
You got something
for me?

32:34.286 --> 32:37.455
Yeah. I probably
shouldn't even be
doing this,

32:37.539 --> 32:39.206
because it violates
everything I believe in,

32:39.291 --> 32:41.626
but I have to
get my employees'
money back, so...

32:41.710 --> 32:44.295
This is Shaw's
travel schedule
for the last 10 years.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.922
It's his guest registry.
Names of judges, politicians,

32:47.007 --> 32:48.924
women,
tail number of his plane,

32:49.009 --> 32:50.718
hull identification
number of his yacht,

32:50.802 --> 32:52.553
names of his race horses
in West Virginia...

32:52.638 --> 32:53.888
Gill's Pride
and Sunny Day.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.307
Yeah, we have
all that, Kovaks.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.560
And eventually
they're gonna sell his
planes and his yachts,

32:59.645 --> 33:02.521
and his horses,
and the bank is
going to take it all.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.231
You guys were his
smallest account.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.942
I'm sorry.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.612
It's okay.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.115
Thought I'd give it a shot.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.911
Kovaks,

33:17.788 --> 33:19.580
you wanna get drunk?

33:22.918 --> 33:23.959
Thanks.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.504
I've got to be
honest with you, Kovaks.

33:26.588 --> 33:30.299
The last time
I drank this much at a bar
I made out with a fireman.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.551
Really?
How long ago was that?

33:33.053 --> 33:34.261
Tuesday.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.640
You know,
you surprise me.

33:37.891 --> 33:42.144
I saw the security tape
of you beating the shit
out of Shaw's car.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.729
That was badass.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.483
Yeah, well,
badass is my middle name.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.860
Nope. Your middle
name is Marvin.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.405
I know that from
your file. Marvin.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.449
All right.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.494
That's my dead grandfather
you're laughing at.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.287
What else is in my file?

34:00.706 --> 34:01.706
Oh.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.417
I know the year your
parents got divorced.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.377
Your SAT scores.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.045
You don't know
my SAT scores.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.964
540, math.
480, verbal.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.300
I retook those.
Your scores went down.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.431
I have to
tell you something,

34:19.975 --> 34:21.891
and I really shouldn't
be telling you this,

34:21.976 --> 34:24.895
because it violates
everything I believe in.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.397
Mmm-hmm.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.983
We still haven't
found Shaw's safety net.

34:29.067 --> 34:33.779
All these guys,
they keep some cash close by
in case they have to run.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.407
Shaw clears out
all of his accounts
three months ago,

34:36.491 --> 34:38.534
20 million and change.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.786
But when we bust him,
the money isn't on him.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.163
Wait.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.248
$20 million?

34:44.498 --> 34:47.460
There's a chance we'll
get lucky and find it.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.672
And if we get lucky,
maybe you can get lucky.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.177
I'm not lucky.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.429
You just have
to be patient.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.891
I don't really have
time to be patient.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.934
Well, if you're
tired of waiting around,

35:04.019 --> 35:06.187
you can always try
the old-school approach.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.354
What's that?

35:08.565 --> 35:12.276
Grab some pitchforks
and a couple of guys
and storm the castle.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.528
They'd never
see you coming.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.655
I have to pee.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.742
Ooh! I'm gonna...
I have to go.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.118
Whoa, whoa.
You can't drive.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.453
I'm gonna get a crab.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.537
Crab?

35:23.622 --> 35:27.124
Listen, you violated
three federal laws

35:27.209 --> 35:28.834
when you beat up
Shaw's Ferrari.

35:29.836 --> 35:30.836
So what?

35:30.921 --> 35:33.839
So a lot of guys
down at the bureau
want to buy you a drink,

35:33.924 --> 35:35.382
and so do I.

35:40.555 --> 35:41.680
Bye.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.474
Goodbye.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.990
Manuel.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.620
Sorry, Mr. K,
I can't let you
into the building.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.872
No, no, I just have to
grab some stuff out of
my office, okay?

36:06.957 --> 36:08.040
I promise
I won't attack anyone.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.124
I can't do it.

36:09.376 --> 36:14.463
Or should I tell
Mr. Simon about you
and the cougar in 2813?

36:16.508 --> 36:18.342
Two minutes.
Okay.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.719
Hi, welcome to Shake Shack.
What can I get you?

37:01.803 --> 37:03.178
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

37:03.263 --> 37:06.181
Welcome to Shake Shack.
What's shaking?
We shake all day.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.683
You like working here?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.144
I cry at night.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.980
You said you know
electrical engineering?

37:14.983 --> 37:17.234
FITZHUGH:
I'm on the phone
with the police.

37:17.319 --> 37:19.737
They have a cruiser
in the area. Go away!

37:19.821 --> 37:23.198
It's me, Mr. Fitzhugh.
Can you open the door,
please?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.288
Hey.
Hey.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.415
Why are you
staying in this motel?

37:31.499 --> 37:33.500
I'm thinking
of becoming
a male prostitute.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.419
I think I might
have a better idea.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.105
Sasha told me
you took a job.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.900
Oh, yeah. I'm using
all the skills you
taught me as a concierge.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.235
Thank you very much.
Hey, no spitting,
blue shirt.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.321
Suck it,
douche bag!

38:02.405 --> 38:03.739
It's not a bad job.
Only problem is

38:03.823 --> 38:05.783
I need 40 hours to
get on the insurance,

38:05.867 --> 38:08.035
it's hard to get shifts,
but if I don't get
on the insurance,

38:08.119 --> 38:09.411
it's probably
gonna end up
costing us

38:09.496 --> 38:11.455
around $20,000
to have the baby.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.083
So we'll probably
have to sell it.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.085
I need your help.

38:17.545 --> 38:21.048
So you're saying you
wanna rob $20 million
from Arthur Shaw.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.258
Which you think
he's hidden in
a secret wall safe

38:23.343 --> 38:24.885
inside his
penthouse apartment.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.512
An apartment
which he's not
allowed to leave

38:26.596 --> 38:28.931
and is guarded by
three FBI agents,
24 hours a day.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.015
Two.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.266
And you wanna
do all of this
in a building

38:31.351 --> 38:32.601
with the most
advanced security

38:32.686 --> 38:34.019
and surveillance
system in the world.

38:34.104 --> 38:36.647
A building which we've
all been barred from
ever entering again?

38:36.731 --> 38:39.566
Yes. How do you
guys feel about that?

38:40.694 --> 38:42.486
Well, I've really
enjoyed myself.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.779
Thanks for the crackers.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.906
Mr. Fitzhugh,
I know the money
is in that safe.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.658
How do you know?

38:47.742 --> 38:50.285
Because in 2003,
Shaw remodeled.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.664
He spent like 10 million
to blow out the kitchen,
move the living room.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.165
He even brought in
some guy from China

38:55.250 --> 38:56.583
to do a whole
feng shui thing.

38:56.668 --> 38:57.835
But he left
one wall standing,

38:57.919 --> 38:59.378
dead center
in the middle
of the apartment.

38:59.462 --> 39:00.754
That's where
he put the safe.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.047
Maybe it's
a load-bearing wall.

39:02.132 --> 39:03.799
No. No, it isn't.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.092
We have the same
wall in my place.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.844
We took it down
when we first moved in.

39:06.928 --> 39:09.013
The FBI can't find
the money, because
he hid it in the wall.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.264
I know it!

39:14.686 --> 39:16.103
So you guys
in or out?

39:16.438 --> 39:17.438
Mr. Fitzhugh?

39:19.065 --> 39:20.274
Come back to me.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.027
Mr. Dev'Reaux?

39:23.111 --> 39:25.821
You know how many weeks
I'd have to work at the BK
to make 20 million?

39:26.281 --> 39:28.157
18,600.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.245
Charlie, come on.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.706
Look at us.
We're basically waiters.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.751
That's what we do.
We bring people stuff.
We don't take things.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.419
You and I know
the movements
of every person.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.087
We know the schedules,
deliveries and codes

39:42.172 --> 39:43.213
for every door
and window.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.716
We've been casing the place
for over a decade,
we just didn't know it.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.384
We didn't know it,
because we weren't
doing it.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.927
But we were.
No.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.804
Okay, where do
the Lippmans keep
their passports?

39:51.639 --> 39:52.723
In the freezer.
Mmm-hmm.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.808
How many in
vitro fertilizations
did Miss Hansen have

39:54.893 --> 39:56.560
before she gave
birth to Jonah?

39:56.644 --> 39:58.103
Six.
See? We know everything!

39:58.188 --> 39:59.980
What's the pass code
for Mr. Shaw's elevator?

40:00.815 --> 40:03.025
I just press
the PH button.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.403
Come on, man.
I need you.

40:06.488 --> 40:08.572
Yeah, you need me,
because you've
got these idiots.

40:08.656 --> 40:09.865
You think we're
getting our money back?

40:09.949 --> 40:11.658
You think Lester is
getting his money?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.410
I talked to the FBI.
It's gone!

40:13.787 --> 40:15.871
So all this is
about getting it
back for Lester?

40:15.955 --> 40:19.958
Yes! And Rose and
Miss lovenko and Manuel
and you, you jerk!

40:20.710 --> 40:23.212
Come on! Let's storm
the castle together.

40:23.296 --> 40:25.214
Oh, like when they went
after Frankenstein?

40:25.298 --> 40:26.673
No, it's a different
kind of storming.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.675
It's a storming
where the peasants
take everything back.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.135
From like
the feudal lords and...

40:30.220 --> 40:31.428
I'm in.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.057
Holy shit! I'm in.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.521
Well, now we're
undefeatable,
aren't we?

40:41.648 --> 40:43.857
Josh, we're not criminals.
We don't know how to steal.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.193
It's okay,
I know someone who does.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.488
Crack four!

40:55.912 --> 40:57.871
You must have been saying
your prayers, Slide.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.039
You made bail.

41:03.795 --> 41:04.962
Slide.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.634
Thought you might
need a ride.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.396
I haven't driven
my Nova for a few months.

41:23.231 --> 41:26.191
Did you know that
in Spanish "No va"
means "It doesn't go"?

41:26.776 --> 41:29.987
That's why they
didn't sell many
in Latin America.

41:32.866 --> 41:34.992
I didn't realize Rikers
was on an actual island.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.995
I thought
it was more of a...
I don't know, like a...

41:38.079 --> 41:40.831
You know,
like the way Puget Sound
is actually an inlet.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.332
But they...

41:43.251 --> 41:45.794
You hungry?
Can I buy you some lunch?

41:47.589 --> 41:48.672
Slide, what are you doing?

41:48.756 --> 41:49.756
Tell me why
you bailed me out!

41:51.009 --> 41:52.009
Take your foot
off the gas!

41:52.093 --> 41:53.427
Answer the goddamn
question first!

41:53.511 --> 41:54.595
Slide!

41:57.265 --> 41:58.265
Red light!

42:05.398 --> 42:06.440
All right,
what's going on?

42:06.524 --> 42:07.566
You wearing
a wire or something?

42:07.650 --> 42:08.775
Some kind of police
undercover shit?

42:08.860 --> 42:10.152
No, I'm not a cop!

42:10.236 --> 42:12.112
Then you brought me
out here for some
kind of freak shit, huh?

42:12.197 --> 42:14.198
You want to
stimulate my nut sack.
Is that what it is, punk?

42:14.282 --> 42:15.574
No! Jesus!

42:15.658 --> 42:17.993
Then what the hell
we doing out here, man?
I don't even know your name.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.995
I'm Josh Kovaks.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.372
Man in the suit.
We talk almost
every morning.

42:22.582 --> 42:23.957
How come you
bailed me out, man?

42:24.626 --> 42:27.586
I need help with something,
and I thought
given our relationship

42:27.670 --> 42:28.795
you might be
willing to help.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.714
Relationship?
I ain't got no
relationship with your ass!

42:30.798 --> 42:31.798
Our history!

42:31.883 --> 42:33.383
What history?
I see you walking by
every now and then.

42:33.468 --> 42:34.635
I say, "Hey, what's up,
little biatch?"

42:34.719 --> 42:36.053
Just another
passer-by going by.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.137
Just another
nigger walking by.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.389
You don't remember 1971?
Mrs. Saltzburg?

42:39.682 --> 42:42.142
We used to get dropped off
at her apartment every
morning for day care.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.603
In 1971 I'm six!
How am I supposed to
remember some shit?

42:44.687 --> 42:46.605
Come on, Darnell,
Mrs. Saltzburg!

42:46.689 --> 42:48.690
Heavy-set German woman,
short goatee.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.817
Man, you call me
Darnell one more time,
I will beat you to death.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.736
You don't remember
Inch High, Private Eye?

42:52.820 --> 42:54.446
Davey and Goliath?
Remember Witchiepoo?

42:54.530 --> 42:56.281
H.R. Pufnstuf.
You got freaked
out by her?

42:56.366 --> 42:57.407
Remember that
kid came over

42:57.492 --> 42:59.993
and he stole my inhaler
and I couldn't breathe?

43:01.412 --> 43:02.704
I do remember you!

43:02.789 --> 43:05.082
You the little seizure boy
that was having them
seizures all the time!

43:05.166 --> 43:06.250
No, I never had
any seizures!

43:06.334 --> 43:07.668
They were minor
spasms of the throat.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.378
And I remember
you would start
foaming up at the mouth

43:09.462 --> 43:11.213
and your eyes
would go crooked.
It was very scary!

43:11.297 --> 43:12.506
There was no foaming.
That was you!

43:12.590 --> 43:14.341
A lot of people
have asthma
when they're kids.

43:14.425 --> 43:16.260
It's not a big deal.
I outgrew it.
No. Seizure Boy.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.470
You'd be on the floor
rolling all around.
You was having seizures!

43:18.554 --> 43:21.056
Asthma doesn't cause
seizures, all right?

43:21.140 --> 43:22.975
Oh, really? Then how come
nobody wanted to play
with your ass?

43:23.059 --> 43:24.101
Nobody wanted to
have naptime with you,

43:24.185 --> 43:25.435
nobody wanted to
do coloring with you
or nothing.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.478
Because of your
little seizures

43:26.562 --> 43:28.021
and didn't nobody
want to catch that shit!

43:28.106 --> 43:29.523
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, punk.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.024
Why did you bail me out?

43:31.109 --> 43:33.986
Because I have a job
and I thought that
given your skill set

43:34.070 --> 43:35.445
maybe you could
help us out.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.072
What kind of
skill set is that?

43:37.740 --> 43:41.034
Taking things that
don't necessarily
belong to you.

43:44.330 --> 43:48.250
Oh, little Seizure Boy
want to try to
rob somebody, huh?

43:49.544 --> 43:50.877
What you trying to steal?

43:52.171 --> 43:53.463
$20 million.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.217
Let's go get
something to eat.

44:05.852 --> 44:08.353
Hey, guys,
this is my friend Slide.

44:09.397 --> 44:10.814
You kidding, right?

44:10.898 --> 44:13.317
These ain't the guys
you wanna try to
do this job with.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.445
Yes, this is
Charlie and Dev'Reaux
and Mr. Fitzhugh.

44:16.529 --> 44:17.654
This is a joke, right?

44:17.739 --> 44:18.905
This guy is
the big time criminal?

44:18.990 --> 44:19.990
Hey, what you say?

44:20.074 --> 44:22.451
All right, guys,
take it easy.
He's totally qualified.

44:22.535 --> 44:23.994
He's been arrested
a bunch of times,

44:24.078 --> 44:26.079
he pays no income taxes,
he's got two
Doberman pinschers.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.289
So let's show
him some respect.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.458
So now we're like
The Doberman Gang?

44:29.542 --> 44:30.584
Like the what?

44:30.793 --> 44:33.503
It was a movie.
They trained Dobermans
to knock off a bank.

44:33.588 --> 44:36.048
Is that the one
where Gregory Peck
was attacked by those dogs?

44:36.132 --> 44:38.508
No, that's Boys from Brazil
with the cloned Hitlers.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.552
Oh, shit. You guys ever
seen Boys Don't Cry?

44:40.636 --> 44:42.721
When Hilary Swank
plays that dude.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.097
That scared
the shit out of me.

44:45.058 --> 44:46.933
Wait, Slide.
Sit down and talk
with us for a second.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.643
These guys ain't
got what it take.

44:48.728 --> 44:49.895
I can look in
their eyes and see it.

44:50.063 --> 44:52.064
First sign of trouble,
they're gonna be
shitting in their pants.

44:52.148 --> 44:53.607
They will not.
You don't know them.

44:54.067 --> 44:55.108
You want me to prove it?

44:55.902 --> 44:57.194
All right,
listen up,

44:57.278 --> 44:59.821
y'all got 15 minutes
to go out there and
steal me something.

44:59.906 --> 45:00.947
What do you mean?

45:01.032 --> 45:03.158
You heard what I said.
In this mall, right now,
each one of y'all

45:03.242 --> 45:05.660
go out there and
individually steal
$50 worth of merchandise,

45:05.745 --> 45:08.413
come back and put
it on the table.
Then we'll talk.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.584
Okay, 50 bucks,
no problem. Come on.

45:12.668 --> 45:13.794
Can I go with you, Josh?

45:13.878 --> 45:15.462
No, you ain't
going with Josh,
you go by yourself.

45:15.546 --> 45:16.546
Everybody
going by theirself.

45:16.631 --> 45:17.714
Anybody can't
handle this, is out.

45:17.799 --> 45:18.924
Okay. Guys,
we can do this.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.717
It's just shoplifting.
You got 15 minutes,
let's go.

45:20.802 --> 45:22.719
And put your wallets
on the table. I don't
want nobody cheating.

45:22.804 --> 45:25.222
I don't want y'all
to go buy the shit
and say you stole it.

45:25.306 --> 45:27.474
All right, come on,
let's go.

45:35.191 --> 45:38.485
This is a part
of our Sexy Little
Things collection.

45:38.569 --> 45:42.906
Oh, yeah, that's great.
Love that. Yeah.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.450
Would you like me to
ring that up for you?

45:45.868 --> 45:49.204
No, I think I'll just
live with it a little first.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.720
These are very
pretty Bella earrings.

46:05.805 --> 46:07.681
They're from our
Timeless Collection.

46:08.307 --> 46:09.891
Do you have any studs?

46:09.976 --> 46:11.601
Yes, several.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.061
Right here.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.355
Do you have any hoops?

46:15.857 --> 46:18.859
Sir, all of our earrings
are on this display.

46:20.862 --> 46:22.487
Do you have a catalog?

46:22.572 --> 46:23.572
Uh...

46:23.698 --> 46:26.533
I might have
one in the back,
let me check.

46:35.168 --> 46:36.293
How do those feel?

46:36.377 --> 46:39.463
They feel a little tight.
Do you have them
in a half size up?

46:39.547 --> 46:41.715
Yeah, let me
check the back.

47:37.396 --> 47:40.106
Hey, them two
pairs of drawers
don't cost no $50.

47:42.527 --> 47:44.236
$12 scented candle.

47:45.738 --> 47:48.406
Okay, we'll get
to work tomorrow.

47:48.491 --> 47:50.200
Wait a minute.
We all just
proved ourselves.

47:50.284 --> 47:51.785
How do we know you can
really pull this off?

47:52.286 --> 47:54.079
You each stole
$50 worth of shit,

47:54.163 --> 47:56.122
I stole $264 in cash.

47:56.207 --> 47:58.792
Rule number one,
never give your
wallet to a thief.

47:59.335 --> 48:00.877
Later, bitches.

48:06.008 --> 48:08.260
What are we
doing up here, man?
My balls are snow cones.

48:08.344 --> 48:09.469
Can I get my jacket?

48:09.554 --> 48:11.388
Everybody
shut up, right now.

48:15.476 --> 48:17.978
In a robbery,
things can change quickly.

48:18.229 --> 48:20.939
It can go from
hot to cold,
just like that.

48:21.023 --> 48:24.025
You have to be
ready to adapt
to the situation.

48:24.110 --> 48:26.236
You have to be able
to think on your feet.

48:26.320 --> 48:29.155
I was on a job a few
days ago where my homie
got shot in the face.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.490
He's kidding, right?

48:30.616 --> 48:31.866
Get shot in the head,
it's over.

48:31.951 --> 48:34.202
If you get shot in
your head, it's over.
If you get shot in your face,

48:34.287 --> 48:36.371
the bullet will
go in your cheek,
then come out the other side.

48:36.455 --> 48:37.789
Then what you
gonna do, sissy?

48:37.873 --> 48:39.624
Die. I'm gonna die.

48:40.084 --> 48:41.626
I saw a television show once

48:41.711 --> 48:44.170
about a guy who
got shot in the head
with a nail gun.

48:44.255 --> 48:45.880
He couldn't even remember
how to chew anymore.

48:45.965 --> 48:47.382
He had to put
everything in a blender.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.092
Yo, he couldn't
figure out how to chew,

48:49.176 --> 48:50.510
but he could
operate a Cuisinart?

48:50.595 --> 48:51.970
I don't think he
operated it himself.

48:52.054 --> 48:53.972
All right,
could we just focus, please?
It's 16 degrees!

48:54.056 --> 48:55.515
That's right!
Let's focus!

48:55.600 --> 48:56.933
Now, earlier today
I taught you all

48:57.018 --> 48:58.602
how to pick a lock
with a bobby pin.

48:58.686 --> 48:59.811
I want y'all to
practice on this door.

48:59.895 --> 49:02.397
I've got bobby pins
for all of y'all.
Here's your bobby pin.

49:02.481 --> 49:03.982
This is your bobby pin.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.900
Here's your bobby pin.

49:05.985 --> 49:08.820
This is your punk-ass
bobby pin. Take it!

49:09.322 --> 49:12.365
You unlock the door,
you won't freeze to death.

49:13.826 --> 49:16.536
I'm gonna be inside
having sex with Rita.

49:19.123 --> 49:20.540
Who's Rita?

49:21.042 --> 49:23.585
To get in the building,
we have to avoid
seven exterior cameras

49:23.669 --> 49:27.088
and six doormen who work
at two entrance points
in rotating shifts.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.549
Once inside,
we'll be faced with
four security officers,

49:29.634 --> 49:32.052
who monitor a bank of
12 internal cameras,

49:32.136 --> 49:33.762
as well as two
floating security guards,

49:33.846 --> 49:35.347
who vary
the patrol route each day.

49:35.431 --> 49:36.473
If we make it
through all of that,

49:36.557 --> 49:37.682
we still have to get
through this gauntlet

49:37.767 --> 49:39.392
of employees to
get to the elevators.

49:39.477 --> 49:40.477
Questions?

49:40.561 --> 49:42.479
Yeah. Who's that
girl in the red dress?

49:42.563 --> 49:44.147
She got
the kind of titties
I like to play with.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.399
That's Mary-Ann
from sales.
She's a lesbian.

49:46.609 --> 49:47.692
Okay, that's irrelevant.

49:47.777 --> 49:48.985
Mary-Ann
is a lesbian?

49:49.070 --> 49:50.862
She was married
when she sold me
my unit.

49:50.946 --> 49:53.031
She makes lesbian sex
with Lynn Rutherford
from accounting.

49:53.115 --> 49:55.325
Okay...
Lynn is a lesbian?

49:55.409 --> 49:56.534
Wait, I'm lost.

49:56.619 --> 49:58.828
How many lesbians total
do we have to avoid?

49:58.913 --> 50:00.497
None. We're not
avoiding lesbians.

50:00.581 --> 50:03.917
I don't avoid
lesbians at all.
I seek lesbians out.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.627
Lesbians got
the nicest titties.

50:06.087 --> 50:07.379
Straight women,
they have guys

50:07.463 --> 50:09.714
pulling and yanking on them
and sweating on them.

50:09.799 --> 50:12.217
Lesbians get
touched delicately
by other lesbians.

50:12.301 --> 50:13.593
It's nice.

50:13.678 --> 50:15.220
Did anybody take in
what I just said?

50:15.304 --> 50:17.138
Well, it seems like
there's a gauntlet
of lesbians.

50:17.223 --> 50:18.556
No. The...

50:18.933 --> 50:20.308
All right,
I'm just gonna keep going.

50:24.939 --> 50:28.983
1:27,
NYPD makes third pass
in front of the building.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.318
The parking
enforcement officer

50:30.403 --> 50:32.112
only works the west
side of the street.

50:32.196 --> 50:33.780
She got
a fat ass, too.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.198
All right, baby,
I'll call you
after lunch.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.533
I'm in a restaurant
with Josh

50:36.617 --> 50:38.910
and a couple of other guys
across from The Tower.

50:39.245 --> 50:40.912
Yeah. I love you.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.042
What are you doing?
It's supposed
to be a secret.

50:46.961 --> 50:49.045
I can't tell my wife
I'm having a lunch?

50:49.130 --> 50:51.756
We're not having lunch.
We're casing the front
of the building.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.341
Now they can trace
our steps back to us.

50:53.426 --> 50:54.968
I didn't tell her what
restaurant we were at.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.720
You said,
"The restaurant
across from The Tower."

50:56.804 --> 50:58.763
I didn't say
which restaurant
across from The Tower.

50:58.848 --> 51:01.933
Geez, a hamburger's $24.
We can't afford
to eat here anyway.

51:02.017 --> 51:04.561
Hey, we can order
whatever we like,
because

51:05.229 --> 51:06.730
Lunch is on me.

51:11.902 --> 51:12.944
This is the main
electrical room.

51:13.028 --> 51:15.405
You can override
the elevators from here
or shut them down completely.

51:15.489 --> 51:17.949
Mr. Dev'Reaux,
who took some courses
at DeVry Technical Institute,

51:18.033 --> 51:19.284
is gonna be our
point man on this.

51:19.368 --> 51:21.077
Online.
What?

51:21.495 --> 51:24.080
I went there to
go get my master's
in electronics,

51:24.165 --> 51:26.916
but somebody said,
"You got to go
to college first."

51:27.001 --> 51:29.210
I was, like,
"Yeah, it wasn't
in the brochure."

51:31.046 --> 51:32.756
Okay,
but you understand what...

51:32.840 --> 51:36.843
Absolutely.
I weld stuff and I'm,
like, you flip it on and off.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.178
It's all about power.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.933
Hey, man, how is this
supposed to be right
if you made it out of Legos?

51:44.018 --> 51:45.852
Well, the dimensions
are completely accurate.

51:46.312 --> 51:48.229
Yeah, who's this
little nigglet? Webster?

51:48.314 --> 51:50.648
Man, you might as
well use Lincoln Logs
or Tinkertoys.

51:50.733 --> 51:51.941
I got your ski caps.

51:52.026 --> 51:53.193
What?

51:53.694 --> 51:55.862
No, no, no.
Ski masks. Masks.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.031
Yeah, but the guy said
that these were
the warmest ever made.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.449
With pompoms?
You serious?

51:59.533 --> 52:02.577
You're such an idiot.
I need a mask.
It has to cover your face.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.330
Josh, let's say
we get the money

52:05.414 --> 52:06.831
and make it outside,
then what?

52:07.625 --> 52:09.417
Slide is the only one
with no connection
to The Tower.

52:09.502 --> 52:11.294
So he's agreed
to hold the money
for a week.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.421
Are you crazy?
You're gonna give
this guy $20 million?

52:13.506 --> 52:14.464
He's a crook!

52:14.548 --> 52:16.966
What you say?
Say it again.
I didn't hear shit.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.593
Speak into the microphone!
Hey! Hey!

52:18.677 --> 52:19.844
Why don't you
say it again, punk?

52:19.929 --> 52:21.429
Come on, Slide, no guns.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.264
You running
things now, huh?

52:23.349 --> 52:24.766
Man in the suit got
it all figured out?

52:24.850 --> 52:26.518
No, man in the suit
doesn't have it
all figured out,

52:26.602 --> 52:27.977
but man with the gun
needs to understand

52:28.062 --> 52:29.938
what man in the suit
is trying to accomplish
here, all right?

52:30.022 --> 52:31.022
Why you talking like that?

52:31.106 --> 52:33.233
You were talking like that!
Why can't I talk like that?

52:33.317 --> 52:35.360
What you think,
this is a joke, Josh?
We gonna just walk in there

52:35.444 --> 52:37.278
and roll this dude
for $20 million
without a fight?

52:37.571 --> 52:40.156
Look, no guns.
End of story,
all right?

52:40.241 --> 52:41.908
What if we run into
some shit in there
we don't expect?

52:41.992 --> 52:43.493
Trust me,
there won't be
any surprises.

52:50.793 --> 52:52.377
It's the FBI lady
and two cops.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.379
Shit! We haven't
done anything yet.

52:54.463 --> 52:56.673
We're plotters.
We've plotted.
That's a crime, right?

52:56.757 --> 52:57.799
Is that a crime?

52:57.883 --> 52:58.883
Everybody, just relax.

52:58.968 --> 53:00.343
You relax!
I'm out on bail.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.178
I'm gonna go
in the closet.
I'm coming with you.

53:02.263 --> 53:03.972
Guys, it's okay,
I think she's here
for me.

53:04.056 --> 53:05.139
Go find
your own spot.

53:07.852 --> 53:12.397
Hey, Agent Denham,
what a surprise.
What's with the police?

53:12.481 --> 53:14.440
Josh, Arthur Shaw
is gonna walk.

53:15.401 --> 53:16.401
What?

53:16.485 --> 53:18.736
The judge is
gonna dismiss the case
next week at his hearing.

53:18.821 --> 53:20.154
They're acting
like he's untouchable.

53:20.990 --> 53:22.740
That's it? He just
gets away with it?

53:22.825 --> 53:23.825
That's not it.

53:23.909 --> 53:26.035
He's threatening
to press charges
against you.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.079
He wants you to
answer for the Ferrari.

53:28.163 --> 53:29.455
So they're here
to arrest me?

53:29.540 --> 53:32.125
He says he'll
drop the whole thing
if you apologize.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.459
A sincere apology,

53:33.627 --> 53:35.545
that's what Shaw wants.

53:35.629 --> 53:36.796
And if I don't do it?

53:37.131 --> 53:39.591
Then these gentlemen
will read you your rights.

53:57.985 --> 54:02.071
You know what's considered
the greatest move in
the history of chess, Josh?

54:02.156 --> 54:03.907
A man named
Frank James Marshall

54:03.991 --> 54:06.576
was losing to a man
named Levitsky in 1912,

54:06.660 --> 54:08.578
world championship
in Helsinki.

54:08.662 --> 54:13.917
And it looked like
Marshall had no chance
until he moved 23 queen G-3.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.419
He deliberately
sacrificed his queen

54:16.503 --> 54:18.630
and the move
was so shocking
and surprising

54:18.714 --> 54:20.798
that Levitsky
never got over it.

54:20.883 --> 54:23.426
He lost the game
two moves later.

54:23.510 --> 54:28.056
And the move became known
in the annals of chess
as the "Marshall swindle."

54:31.977 --> 54:34.479
I'm a very good
chess player,
but I'm no swindler.

54:35.564 --> 54:38.983
What you did to my Ferrari
was the move of a small man.

54:39.068 --> 54:42.987
But now it's my move,
and I'm not sure how
I want to play this.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.033
All I'd like
to say, Mr. Shaw,

54:47.117 --> 54:49.285
is someday
I'm gonna find a way
to make things right.

54:49.912 --> 54:51.120
I don't care
what I have to do,

54:51.205 --> 54:52.497
I will find
a way to pay you back

54:52.581 --> 54:53.915
for everything
that has been done.

54:55.709 --> 54:58.086
Good, because I know
how difficult it
must be for you

54:58.170 --> 55:00.630
to lose a service job
like this at your age.

55:01.215 --> 55:05.134
And one day when all
this is ancient history,
I hope you can come back,

55:05.219 --> 55:06.970
maybe not as a building
manager at first,

55:07.054 --> 55:09.889
but somewhere where
you can start over,
earn our trust.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.391
A doorman,
for instance.

55:13.519 --> 55:16.396
Now go home
and practice
your chess game.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.732
I'll study
the "Marshall swindle,"
sir.

55:20.234 --> 55:22.944
Anybody can sacrifice
their queen, Josh.

55:23.737 --> 55:26.531
The real trick is
getting away with it.

55:33.414 --> 55:34.664
JOSH:
Thanks for the ride.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.541
Any time.
Oh, God, wait a minute,

55:36.625 --> 55:38.918
before you go,
this is for you.

55:40.337 --> 55:41.337
It's a present.

55:41.422 --> 55:43.673
It's the footage of you
beating the shit
out of Shaw's car.

55:43.757 --> 55:46.259
I took it from
the security camera
in his apartment.

55:47.511 --> 55:49.095
You committed
larceny for me?

55:49.596 --> 55:52.181
Let's just say,
I misplaced three
minutes of footage.

55:53.892 --> 55:55.309
Thank you.
I'm touched.

55:55.811 --> 55:57.687
You're welcome.
Okay.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.780
Are you working
on Saturday night?

56:07.865 --> 56:09.365
I'm always working.

56:09.450 --> 56:10.700
Call in sick.

56:11.910 --> 56:14.620
You're asking
an FBI agent to lie?

56:15.414 --> 56:17.290
I'm asking an FBI
agent to dinner.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.169
I'll see you
Saturday night.

56:21.253 --> 56:22.503
Good.

56:28.844 --> 56:30.303
What the hell is that
in your hand?

56:31.472 --> 56:32.764
It's a present.

56:32.848 --> 56:33.973
She gave you
a present?

56:34.266 --> 56:35.349
I don't know
about the other guys,

56:35.434 --> 56:37.560
but I don't want you
seeing the federal agent
anymore.

56:37.644 --> 56:39.062
I'm not seeing her
until Saturday night.

56:39.146 --> 56:40.521
Oh, my God!
He's dating her.

56:40.606 --> 56:43.441
Relax, my social life
and my criminal life
are totally separate.

56:43.525 --> 56:44.776
They're not separate
if you're dating

56:44.860 --> 56:46.819
the FBI agent who
busted Arthur Shaw!

56:46.904 --> 56:48.821
Shouldn't we be
avoiding law enforcement?

56:48.906 --> 56:50.656
I never saw
an episode of Matlock

56:50.741 --> 56:52.492
where the criminal
banged Matlock!

56:52.743 --> 56:54.786
Well, it don't matter.
Is this the safe?

56:55.454 --> 56:56.412
Yeah.

56:56.497 --> 56:58.498
Then we have a really
serious problem.

57:02.669 --> 57:03.878
You saying
you can't open it?

57:03.962 --> 57:06.047
No, I'm saying
I never worked on
a safe like this before.

57:06.131 --> 57:07.381
I usually break
into strongboxes.

57:07.466 --> 57:09.342
You never said
it was a real safe
made out of steel.

57:09.468 --> 57:10.927
We're going after
$20 million.

57:11.011 --> 57:12.011
What did you think
it would be? Wood?

57:12.096 --> 57:13.971
What kind of thief
can't open a safe?

57:14.056 --> 57:15.681
Well, generally
I rob balconies.

57:15.766 --> 57:17.600
Balconies?
Like a cat burglar?

57:17.684 --> 57:19.477
That way I never get
charged with breaking
and entering.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.145
And I never steal
nothing over $1,000,

57:21.230 --> 57:23.189
because in New York
that shit is a felony.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.108
What do you get?
Like potted plants?

57:25.192 --> 57:27.276
No, bitch!
I don't be stealing
no potted plants!

57:27.361 --> 57:29.112
I steal mostly
satellite dishes.

57:29.196 --> 57:31.405
I got a friend of mine
who be hooking up
illegal DirecTV.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.324
Hey, can your friend
hook me up?

57:33.408 --> 57:34.951
No!
This is a bunch
of horseshit.

57:35.035 --> 57:36.327
Your thief isn't
even a thief.

57:36.411 --> 57:38.496
Hang on a sec.
You can figure
this out, right?

57:38.580 --> 57:40.248
No, I can't
figure this out.

57:40.332 --> 57:42.458
I'm serious.
You have to find
a actual safe-cracker.

57:42.543 --> 57:43.793
Where am I gonna
find a safe-cracker?

57:43.877 --> 57:45.920
I don't know.
You have to start
thinking outside the box.

57:46.004 --> 57:49.924
Shit, you got to find
somebody with some
safe-cracking history. Think!

57:51.677 --> 57:54.554
So, Odessa,
I think we should address
the elephant in the room.

57:55.013 --> 57:56.973
What the hell
you just call me?

57:57.057 --> 57:59.642
No, no.
I'm talking about
the anger you have for me.

57:59.726 --> 58:01.018
How you blame me for
losing the pension,

58:01.103 --> 58:03.020
which is the last thing
I ever wanted to happen.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.815
I know you're
a good man, Mr. K,

58:05.899 --> 58:07.441
even though you
ruined my life.

58:07.526 --> 58:09.193
Which is why
I invited you here.

58:09.486 --> 58:11.028
When I hired you,
I made a note that

58:11.113 --> 58:12.655
you worked for your
father in Kingston.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.906
He was a locksmith.

58:14.241 --> 58:15.658
Yes, the best in Jamaica.

58:15.742 --> 58:16.742
Uh-huh.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.870
Did he teach you
how to open locks

58:18.954 --> 58:20.580
and doors and
things like that?

58:20.664 --> 58:22.999
There ain't no lock
I can't get by, Mr. K.

58:23.876 --> 58:28.504
I was just wondering,
do you think you
could open this thing?

58:28.589 --> 58:32.008
That safe has
a six-number wheel pack
with a double-action fence.

58:32.092 --> 58:34.051
Very tricky spindle.

58:34.136 --> 58:35.970
Probably take me
15 minutes to open.

58:36.471 --> 58:39.473
Fifteen minutes?
Could you show us?

58:40.809 --> 58:42.602
What's in it for me?

58:45.522 --> 58:47.523
2:42,
Lester at his post.

58:50.110 --> 58:53.112
Couple of NYPD officers
at the falafel cart.

58:56.325 --> 58:57.825
Wait a second.

58:58.285 --> 58:59.785
That's Charlie.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.456
What's Charlie doing here?

59:03.874 --> 59:06.751
Yeah, why is Charlie
going into The Tower?

59:13.967 --> 59:15.593
What did you do?

59:15.886 --> 59:19.889
I went to talk to Mr. Simon.
He called me,
said he had a job for me.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.808
He wants me to be
the building manager.

59:23.477 --> 59:25.144
He asked you to be
the building manager?

59:25.229 --> 59:28.231
Yeah, he offered me
your job, so I took it.

59:28.315 --> 59:30.775
That's ridiculous!
You're not qualified.

59:30.859 --> 59:34.278
But it's not ridiculous
for you to rob $20 million?

59:34.363 --> 59:36.405
I can't believe
how irresponsible
you're being!

59:36.490 --> 59:38.532
You really think
that you're gonna
just stroll in there

59:38.617 --> 59:40.576
like Robin Hood
and his band
of merry doormen

59:40.661 --> 59:42.787
and outsmart the guys
with ear pieces and guns?

59:42.871 --> 59:44.872
Why is that so hard
for you to believe, huh?

59:44.957 --> 59:46.874
Why can't you just be
my skinny Friar Tuck?

59:47.167 --> 59:48.793
Come on!
Who's Friar Tuck?

59:48.877 --> 59:51.128
Friar Tuck is the guy
who helps Robin Hood!

59:51.797 --> 59:53.297
I can't do this, Josh.

59:53.382 --> 59:56.634
You put one foot
inside The Tower,
I'm gonna call in a Code Blue.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.219
It's black.
It's Code Black!

59:58.345 --> 59:59.929
You call it black,
I call it blue.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.683
Maybe I made up new codes,
because I'm in charge
of The Tower now.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:07.228
I'm warning you, Josh,
come near, it's a
Code Blue-Black.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.528
First thing you do,
you have to find
the entry point.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.990
You have to use
your fingers when you
find the entry point.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.868
It's all in the touch.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.579
You married?

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:28.499
Say what?
You married?

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.378
No, I ain't married.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.714
What's up?

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:37.133
Just taking a poll.

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.342
Taking a poll?

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:40.219
I'll take your poll.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.309
Why did you
call me here?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:47.810
I got a call
two hours ago

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.520
from Judge Hollingsworth's
clerk.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:51.981
They're moving
Arthur's court date
up to Thanksgiving.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.065
Thanksgiving?

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.234
The judge wants to avoid
a media circus on this,

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.320
let him walk as
quietly as possible.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.280
It's an act of contrition.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:00.948
By the way,
Agent Denham,

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:04.243
I'll be pressing
charges against Josh
and all his accomplices

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:06.037
the moment
I step out of court.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:09.332
Come on,
he did what you asked,
he apologized.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.710
It's time everyone
paid for their mistakes.

01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:14.795
I agree.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:21.302
Hello.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:22.970
There's something
that you need to know.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:27.391
They moved Shaw's court date
up to Thursday,
and he's coming for you.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:28.893
You'll be in jail
by the weekend.

01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:31.228
That really messes up
our plans, doesn't it?

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.816
Josh, you need to
get yourself a lawyer.

01:01:36.485 --> 01:01:37.818
Take care.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:43.449
Great news,
it worked.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.118
We're good
for Thanksgiving.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.547
My sister will be
taking the Q train

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.007
to my uncle's
house in Brighton.

01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:01.425
She cooks for him
every year.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.052
How am I gonna know
what she looks like?

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.470
Here.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.971
Got it.
Okay.

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.232
"I know some of you
believe I'm the reason

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:19.693
"Paul McCartney didn't
buy an apartment here
in 2008.

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:21.070
"Maybe I did get
a little confused

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.322
"about the meaning
of the word 'wanker.'

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:26.325
"Maybe you heard about
the Mrs. Jin incident.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.620
"I know that I'm
not Josh Kovaks.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.415
"But today
I am your leader.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:35.376
"And today is Thanksgiving,
the toughest day of
the year for The Tower.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.712
"Forty-three parties,
close to 500 guests,
30 caterers,

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.215
"all of Garage 2
blocked until 4:00.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:44.260
"Today, you might say,
is our Super Bowl.

01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:48.055
"Today, you might say,
we will not lose."

01:02:51.143 --> 01:02:52.143
Booyah.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.832
The start of
Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade
is just moments away.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:17.334
Three million people
will line the streets
of this city.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:19.336
Fifty million more
will watch from homes

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:21.839
all across the country
and around the globe.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:24.800
When the parade begins,
all eyes turn to the sky

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:28.137
as the largest
balloons in the world
soar above this city.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.223
It's a sight that
brings out the child
in all of us.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:53.954
Hey, Josh,
here's your sister's phone.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:54.997
Great.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.457
She's really hot,
by the way.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:10.930
Watch your head,
Mr. Shaw.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.308
Where's Slide?

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:15.684
He's supposed
to be here.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:25.027
They're on the move.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.113
Wait a sec.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.659
Oh, God.
What?

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.410
What is it?
It's Slide.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:34.620
Is he coming up here?

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.539
Shit!
ENRIQUE:
What is he doing?

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:37.623
He's wearing my suit.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.458
He stole my suit.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.086
He's heading
for The Tower.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.587
Well, that's not the plan.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:45.798
How do you forget a plan?
Didn't he write it down?

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:46.882
He didn't forget it.

01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:48.384
All that time he
spent with Odessa,

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:49.802
he thinks he
can open the safe.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:50.970
I don't understand.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.388
He's going for the money.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:53.973
Didn't I tell you
he would screw us?

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:55.808
What are we gonna do?

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.227
We stick to the plan.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.145
We go on Snoopy.

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:06.735
Holy shit!
You guys are not
gonna believe this.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.029
That girl that
moved into 4811?

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.906
She's in French
Playboy this month.

01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:14.326
And in French Playboy,
they're even more naked.

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:17.663
Mrs. Goshen is looking
for a Turkish loose tea,

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.999
an orange pekoe
or mint melody.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.751
Well, just send her
an assortment, Rose.

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:25.588
"I'm at Lenox Hospital,
my water broke."

01:05:27.716 --> 01:05:29.300
It's happening.
Rose, cover for me.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.926
I'm having a baby.
I'm having a baby!

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:32.094
Excuse me.
I'm having a baby.

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:04.001
Guys, check it out.
Snoopy.

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.961
I like Snoopy.

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:07.713
Yeah, it's Snoopy.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:10.007
DOORSnoopy!
Snoopy!

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:26.190
It's Huang's birthday!
Everybody come and sing.

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:28.734
Ron, Manuel,
come and sing.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.362
Come on, everybody.
Everybody come on,
come on now.

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:32.863
Everybody come on now.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.663
So what happened
to Mr. Larkin?

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.164
We had to fire Mr. Larkin.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.041
He was involved
with some illicit
sexual behavior

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.085
that we at Chase Manhattan
just will not tolerate.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.295
If you wanna wear
a black leather hood
and whip your own ass,

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.339
work at Bank of America.

01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:54.134
So you'll be taking
over his account,
Mr. Davis?

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:56.136
Yes, I will.
Working holidays?

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:57.846
We've been very
patient with you

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.849
with regard to
the Fitzhugh foreclosure,
but the bank is ready to sell.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.685
And we'd like to
personally offer you
a finder's fee

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.353
if we can move
the remodel along.

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:05.938
A finder's fee?
Mmm.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.357
We just started
demolishing
the apartment.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.566
The place is gonna
look like new.

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:11.694
It's going to be
one of the finest
units of the building.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.195
I'd love to see it.
Can I see it?

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.864
Here you go.
There you go.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:33.006
Well, looks like
the staff is having
a little party.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:45.102
We were supposed to
be in that elevator.

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:46.437
Come on.

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.692
We have to go up.
Let's go.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:53.652
All the way
to the top?

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:58.866
So, as you'll see,
this entire apartment
is being redone.

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:01.785
All new appliances.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:04.413
Floor-to-ceiling windows.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:05.914
Hardwood floors.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.583
Oh, hardwood floors.
That's nice.

01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:09.084
Tell me,
are you gonna do
the closets over?

01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:10.252
Yes, right this way.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.336
Oh, yes. This way.

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:14.089
This is the master
bedroom closet.

01:08:14.174 --> 01:08:15.758
It'll have new
sliding racks.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.761
And what beautiful doors.
Are these doors
made of mahogany?

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.930
Mr. Davis?

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.349
Excuse me, Mr. Davis.
I'm locked in the closet.

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:27.227
Hello?

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:04.389
Sorry, no cleaning now.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.642
It's okay,
I'll come back.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:07.893
Do you want some cake?

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.645
We're celebrating
a birthday downstairs.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:10.729
No, thank you.

01:09:11.022 --> 01:09:12.773
It's amazing cake,
are you sure?

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.649
I'm allergic to chocolate.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.609
I break out in hives.
I can't touch it.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.162
Bumbaclot!

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.166
You should have
tried the cake, man.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.272
Odessa,
did he take the cake?

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:56.149
He's allergic to chocolate.
I had to beat him.

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.391
Oh, shit.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:30.726
The maid has gone rogue!

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.811
Put him in the chair.

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.656
Very spacious.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.178
Got it! Come on.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:37.709
Yeah.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.464
This is incredible.
Yeah.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:45.717
I have to hand it
to you, Mr. Kovaks,
you were right.

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:47.719
Move away
from the safe.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.973
I ain't gonna
say it again.
Back up!

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:53.308
Are you serious?
What are you doing?

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:54.559
Hey, Josh, I'm a thief.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.645
I keep telling you
I'm a thief, but you
don't want to believe it.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.563
I know exactly what I am.
You're the one
that's confused.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.149
Now back up
before I pop a cap
in your ass.

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.234
No.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.152
No?

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:05.278
Yeah, no.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:08.156
Look at my face.

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:09.449
You see how serious I am.

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:10.826
I'm pretty serious, too.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:11.952
Are you ready
to die, bitch?

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:13.203
That's my suit.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.289
Yeah, I got on your
suit and your drawers
and socks, too! So what?

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.416
I want my suit back.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.794
I will blow your face
clean off your face!
Now, back up!

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:23.171
You think I'm gonna
let this shit get away?

01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:24.923
You don't
have a choice.

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:26.466
I brought my own gun.

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:28.635
Now put your shit down,
nice and slow.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:36.977
You mess with me,
you're a dead man.
Now drop it!

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:38.145
Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.479
I'm putting it down
right now.

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:41.189
Take it easy.

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:47.404
On the ground,
you punk-ass bitch!

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.698
Bitch, on the ground!
We had a plan!
Take it easy.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.867
We had a plan!
Fitz, calm down.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:53.368
Come on now. Shit!
Fitz, take it easy.

01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:54.703
Be cool with the gun, man.
Okay. All right.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:55.746
Relax.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.748
I'm relaxed,
you relax!

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.586
You sissy... You bitch!

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.642
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
America's queen of comedy,

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.311
Joan Rivers.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.980
And here's Kanye West.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:24.816
Charlie,
what are you doing back?

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.985
Rose, please.
I feel like my
head's gonna fall off.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.738
I raced over to the hospital,
she's not there.
I can't find her.

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.114
I get into
an argument
with 15 doctors.

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:33.075
I said, "Where's
my wife?" They said,
"Your wife's not here."

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.242
I called my Uncle
Marty in Brighton.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.368
I say,
"You got to
get over here.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:36.661
"She's not here.
Nobody can find her."

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:37.788
He said,
"What do you mean
no one can find her?

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:39.414
"She's in the television room,
watching television."

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.041
I said, "Are you kidding me?
Put her on the telephone."

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.084
He puts her
on the telephone.

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:43.877
I said, "What are you doing?
Your water didn't break?"

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:45.462
"No." "Your vagina's
not dilated?" "No."

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:46.630
I said,
"Why did you send
me a text message?"

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:50.884
She says, "I didn't
send you a text message.
I can't find my phone!"

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:53.386
Have you seen Josh?

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:58.058
Manuel,
will you show me
the penthouse hallway?

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.021
These FBI guys
are always falling asleep.

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.649
Where is Mr. Simon?

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:09.277
He was showing
Mr. Fitzhugh's old
apartment to some guy.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:14.241
Manuel, do you think
something strange
is going on?

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.786
They cut Miss Piggy
from the parade.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:19.704
I think that's strange.

01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:30.882
Well, it's been
nice meeting you,
Agent Denham.

01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:34.928
You know, I'm still trying
to decide if I should
go after your badge.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.722
Either way,
no hard feelings
on my part.

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:41.685
Maybe we could
have dinner sometime,
my treat. Huh?

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.989
Can I help you?

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.907
We have a meeting
with Judge Hollingsworth.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.409
Judge Hollingsworth
is down in D.C.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.703
He goes down every year
to spend the holiday
with his daughter.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:00.829
Are you sure?

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.831
There's no one
here today, ma'am.
It's Thanksgiving.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:04.833
What the hell
is going on?

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:05.959
Back in the car.

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:07.502
Wait, no.
Wait a second.
Back in the car.

01:15:07.587 --> 01:15:09.087
Wait a minute!

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.093
Three, four, five,

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.679
six, seven, eight.

01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:22.934
You open it, Mr. K.

01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:32.861
Wow.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.154
Oh, my God.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.656
This can't be real.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:42.287
Empty! After all
this shit, it's empty.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.164
Man, what kind of...

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:46.166
Give me my gun back.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.001
This is over.
Give me my gun...

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.003
I might need it
to get out of here.
I'm not giving it to you.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:52.047
Stop bullshitting
and give me the gun.
No! I don't want to.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:53.673
Give me the goddamn gun!
Fitz, give him the gun!

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:55.800
Give him the gun!
Guys. Guys!

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.135
What the hell is
wrong with you, man?

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.386
You gonna kill
somebody in here!

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:00.555
Sorry.
What the hell, man?

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.314
Give me that crowbar.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.776
What?
Did you find something?

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.242
What is that?
Gold.

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.327
Real gold?
Holy shit.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:25.205
The hood is solid gold.
Do you have any idea
what that's worth?

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:29.000
It's not just the hood.
It's the whole car.

01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:31.211
This is where
he hid the money.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.298
This car must
weigh 2,000 pounds.

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:38.093
Sixteen ounces to a pound,
that's 32,000 ounces.

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:41.471
The current price of
gold is $1,872 per ounce.

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:44.641
Josh, it's about
45 million.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.893
Jesus!
$45 million?

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:48.853
Give or take 10 million.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.273
Give me that crow bar.
I am going to break
a chunk off this bitch.

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:52.607
Are we going
to chop it up?

01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:54.359
ENRIQUE:
How we gonna do that?

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:56.444
Why don't we take
the whole thing?

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:57.570
What?

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.864
What are we gonna do?
Roll it out the front door?

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.032
It's not gonna fit.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.076
It is too big.
It won't go
through the door.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.119
Man.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:06.288
And the doors in
Fitzhugh's apartment
are torn out.

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:08.164
Too bad it is
six floors down.

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:09.666
Shit!

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.461
How much you say
it weighs?

01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:42.574
It has to be green,
because green means go.

01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:50.248
It's moving.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.424
This is crazy.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:08.933
Josh, this is really crazy.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:15.065
Okay, all right.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:16.441
Got it?
Yeah.

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:21.112
All right.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.535
Hey, do you know
of any reason

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.871
somebody would
want you out of your
penthouse right now?

01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:31.998
No.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:36.378
Mr. Shaw, I think
you're being robbed.

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.596
This is a bad idea.
Really? Which part?

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.680
The part where
you screw us over

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:49.099
and try to take
everything for yourself?

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:50.809
Even when you were
six you couldn't share.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:52.227
Maybe I just
didn't want to share

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:53.561
with your silly
seizure-having ass.

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:54.729
All right,
you know what?
That's it!

01:18:54.814 --> 01:18:57.649
I don't want you
talking to me for
the rest of the robbery.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.322
Okay, take it up.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:05.824
All right.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:30.181
All right, lower it.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.046
A little more.
A little more.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.382
Okay, stop!

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:07.469
Grab it, Fitz!

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.347
You have to reach
out and pull it in.

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:15.560
I really don't
want to do that.
I wanna go home now.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.896
Home to my old life.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.607
Do you have any idea
how happy I used to be?

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.318
My wife and I flew
first class to Greece.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:25.904
We swam naked.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.407
We ate lamb.

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.326
Stop acting
like a bitch
and pull that shit in!

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.077
He's freaking out.
We have to get down there.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:36.372
Shit.

01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:40.001
What are you doing?

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.794
That's it, we popped.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:42.921
We are not popped.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.005
What are you doing?

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.673
I'm gonna shoot
this guy in the foot
when he comes in

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:46.841
and you are gonna slam
the door in his face.

01:20:46.926 --> 01:20:47.967
No, that's a bad idea.

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.844
You shoot the FBI
agent in his foot,
he is gonna come in here

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:52.180
and he is gonna shoot
a nigger in his ass.
It's over.

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:53.306
All right, great.
You give up then.

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.390
I'm out of here.
Hey!

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:56.768
I can do it.
I'm no bitch.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:58.394
Yeah.

01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:05.109
Okay...

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.904
I can do it.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:10.698
It's kind of like sailing.

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:22.293
Keep moving!

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:23.711
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!

01:21:24.505 --> 01:21:26.130
I'm not going out there.

01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:43.439
I got it!

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:46.568
Oh, no.

01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:54.909
Yo, we got a dangler!

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:56.661
Help me!

01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:58.830
ENRIQUE:
Fitzhugh is dangling!

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.582
Shit!
Fitz!

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:05.670
Help!

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:07.714
I'm gonna fall!

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:10.133
Josh, help me!

01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:13.761
I don't want to die.

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:16.889
There's a rope.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:18.683
Grab the rope!

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.061
I can't!

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.730
Listen to me.
No!

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:26.399
Take your hand off the car
and grab the rope!

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:29.193
It's your only chance!

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:38.286
Yeah! Reach out!

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:45.126
FITZHUGH:
It's too far!

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.711
No, it's not!

01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:58.389
I got you. I got you.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:04.896
I got you. Come on.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.482
What are you doing, man?

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:09.442
We're stealing the car.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:14.530
FBI, you got to
let us through.

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:17.241
Can't. The parade
is coming right at us
for another half hour.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:19.744
You're gonna have to
go around the entire park.
I'm sorry.

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:27.919
Holy shit!
Whoa!

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.296
Josh.

01:23:30.381 --> 01:23:33.299
Fitzhugh!
What's happening?
Are you okay?

01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:36.177
Come in. Fitzhugh!

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.261
Dev'Reaux.

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:38.596
Charlie?

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.683
Where are you?
The roof!

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.351
We need to swing
the car over to the window.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:51.901
Dev'Reaux,
I'm gonna try
and reel the car in,

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.028
but I'm gonna
need your help.

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:58.783
I'm starting to
get kind of queasy.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.119
Fitzhugh, get the rope.
We're gonna hook it.

01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:06.290
I'm gonna call Ralph.
What?

01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:08.501
I'm getting
ready to call Ralph.
Who's Ralph?

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:22.640
Pull!

01:24:30.858 --> 01:24:31.899
Hi, guys.

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:33.401
CHARLIE:
God damn it, Josh.

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:35.653
You realize what
you have done to me?
You have ruined my life.

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:37.572
Do you understand
that I'm a part
of this now?

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:39.365
And for what?
So you could
steal a car?

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:41.451
Yeah, worth 45 million,
made out of gold.

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:43.161
Gold?

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:44.662
It's worth 45 million?

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.247
Give or take 10 million.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.041
All right,
come on. Let's push it
into the elevator.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:50.710
I don't think
it's gonna fit.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:53.004
No, it won't fit
in the elevator.

01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:55.506
But it doesn't have to.

01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:11.981
I'm stopping the elevator
right under you guys.

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:17.445
Okay. So what do we do
when we get it downstairs?

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:19.197
We'll think of something.
Check the glove box.

01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.032
Keys have to be
here somewhere.

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:27.038
I don't see any keys.
Nothing.

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:39.592
Holy shit!

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.052
Josh.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:44.055
Can you take Lucy
on a walk for me?

01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:49.018
My feet are swollen,
and there's a goddamn parade.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:52.063
You know, now is
not a great time,
Mrs. Cronan.

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:53.397
Charlie,

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:57.401
give her one of those
liver treats that you
keep on your desk.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.487
Yes, ma'am.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:01.072
Thank you.

01:26:14.253 --> 01:26:16.170
Agent Claire Denham
requesting backup

01:26:16.255 --> 01:26:18.172
at The Tower on
Central Park West.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.101
)

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:36.566
Okay.

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:04.135
All right.
On three.
One, two, three.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:05.887
Come on.

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.555
Easy, easy, easy!

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:10.349
Okay, it's stable.

01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:12.143
That wasn't so bad.

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:17.815
Whoa!

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:21.819
What's happening?
Why are we moving?

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.113
It's security!
They're overriding me!

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:39.962
It's the lobby.

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:42.548
Shh!

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:09.951
Fitz. Take her!
Take Lucy! Here.

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:11.118
What? What?

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:13.037
Okay. I got her.

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:26.550
No, no. No!

01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:28.219
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.651
I think they're gone.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:45.069
We need to get out
of here right now.

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:47.196
Slide.
Yeah.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.198
We got to use the truck.
Where are the keys?

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.658
Under the sun visor.

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:52.743
You leave the keys?
In New York?

01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.161
It's a stolen car.

01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:57.081
You brought
a stolen car
to a robbery?

01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:00.459
Lester,
you still there?

01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:03.129
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm holding four cabs
at the north door.

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:04.296
Slight change of plan.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:07.425
There's a white truck parked
on 60th and Broadway,
keys on the visor.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:08.676
You got to back it
up to the elevator.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.760
I'm on my way.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:31.240
Mr. Shaw, tell me
about this safe.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:32.491
It's empty.

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:34.994
Doesn't matter if
it's empty or full.

01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:36.537
A hidden safe
was never mentioned

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:38.456
in the inventory
of your apartment.

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.915
You neglected
to inform us,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.043
which is a violation
of your parole,
therefore...

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:44.045
Where is my car?
Where is my goddamn car?

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:48.299
I hereby remand you
to federal custody
until your real court date.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.217
You just forfeited
$10 million.

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:52.261
You think I care
about $10 million?

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.555
You think I care
if I spend a few
nights in jail?

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.474
We both know I'm
going to be out
by the weekend.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.601
But you let that car
leave this building

01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:00.978
and I promise you
won't get off so easy.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:03.522
Take him away.
Lock it down.

01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:06.484
This is Agent Huggins.
Lock down the building.

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:18.204
Show me the garage.

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:20.122
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:25.211
They got the car.
Come on! Come on!

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:42.937
There they are!

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:44.438
Here we go, baby.

01:30:50.529 --> 01:30:51.779
Move out of the way.

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:54.990
Go. Go.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.875
CLOWN:
Get out of the way!

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:12.842
Careful. Careful.
Jesus Christ!

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:21.350
Freeze! Do not move!

01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:24.812
Open it.

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:34.238
Son of a bitch!
It's a diversion.

01:31:39.703 --> 01:31:42.121
Lester,
they are gonna get hurt.
There is no way out of this.

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:44.373
I don't know what
you are talking about.

01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:47.668
All I did is steal a truck
and try to commit suicide.

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:02.641
FBI AGENT 1:
Mr. Fitzhugh? FBI.
You're under arrest, sir.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:03.767
Oh.

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.562
Please put your hands
behind your back.

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:10.733
FBI AGENT 2:
Miss Montero, FBI,
you're under arrest.

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:15.196
Charlie Gibbs, FBI,
you're under arrest.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.614
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.157
Anything you say,
can and will be

01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:19.992
used against you
in a court of law.

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:21.493
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:27.625
Mr. Dev'Reaux, FBI.
Show me your hands.
You're under arrest.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.387
Show me your hands, Josh.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:45.100
It was smart.

01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:49.438
Thanksgiving, the parade,
changing the court date,

01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:53.067
using Lester
as a diversion,
lying to me.

01:32:54.361 --> 01:32:57.112
We have reservations
Saturday night at six
different restaurants.

01:32:57.197 --> 01:33:00.115
I'll give you the names
if you wanna check.

01:33:00.492 --> 01:33:02.952
That's okay,
I trust you.

01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:30.104
Where is my car?

01:33:32.649 --> 01:33:34.441
Do you mean
the car made of gold?

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:37.361
Gold melted down
from the money you stole?

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.529
I haven't seen it.

01:33:38.989 --> 01:33:40.572
They'll find it.

01:33:40.991 --> 01:33:44.118
And when they do,
my friends on the bench
will take no pity on you.

01:33:44.411 --> 01:33:46.704
They'll make sure
you go away for
a very long time.

01:33:47.372 --> 01:33:49.081
See, you people
are working stiffs,

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:50.791
clock punchers.

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.626
Easily replaced
and erased.

01:33:53.253 --> 01:33:55.296
And just know that
while you are all
sitting in jail,

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:57.131
I'll be right up
there in the penthouse

01:33:57.215 --> 01:33:59.341
of The Tower,
doing what I do best.

01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:01.760
We may be going to
jail for a few years,

01:34:01.845 --> 01:34:05.222
but you, you're going
for the rest of your life.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:06.890
How'd you figure that?

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:08.392
I found your ledger.

01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:10.311
You know,
the one that
you stuck

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:12.438
in the owner's manual
of your Ferrari.

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:13.731
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:34:14.024 --> 01:34:15.774
I'm guessing you
don't really care
about the car.

01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:17.693
You could care less
about 45 million,

01:34:17.777 --> 01:34:20.321
but I bet you want
that ledger back.

01:34:20.947 --> 01:34:22.281
Am I right?

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:23.532
What do you
think you're doing?

01:34:26.077 --> 01:34:27.911
Sacrificing my queen.

01:34:32.459 --> 01:34:34.752
Okay, you and I
are gonna make
a deal, Josh.

01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:38.380
A deal that will
make you and your
friends very wealthy.

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:41.759
Do you think
that car has value?
Multiply it by 10.

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:43.719
In cash.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:50.100
Dev'Reaux, will you
please remind Mr. Shaw?

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:55.105
I'm very sorry, Mr. Shaw,
but we don't accept
tips at The Tower.

01:34:59.152 --> 01:35:00.486
Checkmate.

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:09.828
Hello!

01:35:15.502 --> 01:35:18.170
We've got FBI
agents and police
all over the city.

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:20.297
We know about
your friend Slide
from Astoria.

01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:22.007
Your little trick
with Lester may have

01:35:22.092 --> 01:35:23.342
gotten the car
out of the building,

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:26.637
but it's just
a matter of time
before we find it.

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:29.723
Who is this?

01:35:29.808 --> 01:35:30.849
Director Mazin.

01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:33.394
I am Mr. Kovaks' attorney,
Miss lovenko.

01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:35.729
I will be representing
all the defendants
in this case.

01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:40.401
And you're licensed
to practice in the state
of New York?

01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:43.320
I passed the bar
three days ago.

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:50.494
I'd like to request
the immediate release
of all the defendants.

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:53.122
On what grounds?

01:35:57.377 --> 01:35:59.044
These are Mr. Shaw's
hand-written notes

01:35:59.129 --> 01:36:01.088
detailing his
fraudulent business
practices.

01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:03.090
There are names, dates,
account numbers.

01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:04.633
My guess is you'll
find enough evidence
in there

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:06.009
to put him away
for a very long time.

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:09.012
But this only happens
if my clients walk.

01:36:09.973 --> 01:36:11.682
You've been a lawyer
for less than a week

01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:14.518
and you're trying
to bribe the United
States government?

01:36:15.478 --> 01:36:17.688
Sharks are born
swimming, sir.

01:36:24.988 --> 01:36:26.864
I'll let everyone
walk but Kovaks.

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:31.493
As a first-time offender,
he'll probably get
two years for the car.

01:36:32.245 --> 01:36:33.620
Best I can do.

01:36:39.461 --> 01:36:41.295
Nobody else
will be charged?

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:46.300
FEMALE NEWS REPORTER:
New evidence in
the Arthur Shaw trial

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.470
has prompted a new plea
from the accused swindler.

01:36:49.554 --> 01:36:51.722
Sources are now
confirming that Mr. Shaw

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:54.141
will enter
a guilty plea next week.

01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.898
Are we gonna
do this or what?
Mmm-hmm.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:16.747
Hallelujah!

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:27.174
Welcome to
the penthouse,
Mr. Shaw.

01:37:28.134 --> 01:37:29.718
Look who's coming now.

01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:34.097
Wait until
I get a hold of
your wrinkled ass.

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.099
He looks good!

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:47.528
Are you Rose Demato?
Yes.

01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:49.071
Sign right here, please.

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:52.366
All right, thanks.

01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:17.975
It's a gold wheel!
