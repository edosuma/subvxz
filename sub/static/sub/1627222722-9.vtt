WEBVTT

00:27.069 --> 00:29.863
Yeah.
So it's really nothing but good news.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.742
Her grades are outstanding
and she's great in class.

00:33.825 --> 00:37.579
She asks good questions,
and she's got her own opinions.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.457
And I'm sure that when she gets older,

00:40.541 --> 00:43.210
she's gonna be able to do
whatever she wants with her life.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.711
Right.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.797
Sorry?

00:47.631 --> 00:51.552
No. Thank you. That's really sweet.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.554
I mean it.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.055
No, I know you do.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.602
-Okay. Well... were there any questions--
-I just--

01:00.686 --> 01:02.312
I used to be like her.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.149
-Right on.
-Yep. Yeah.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.695
Oh, God.
I would get all straight As when I was 11.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.280
-Nice.
-Oh, my God.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.574
And fifth grade? Come on.
I was the shit at math.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.869
-I'd get 100s on my math tests.
-That's awesome.

01:16.952 --> 01:20.247
I mean, you know, it didn't really matter,
but it felt good at the time.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.418
And everybody would tell me
the same things, you know?

01:24.501 --> 01:28.338
"She's so smart. She can do anything
as long as she puts her mind to it."

01:29.256 --> 01:30.883
Where did that get me, right?

01:33.427 --> 01:34.636
Do you need to get that?

01:34.720 --> 01:37.181
-No, no, no.
-No, that's okay. That's fine.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.100
I gotta go anyway.
You go ahead and handle that.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.311
-And thank you. No, it's okay.
-It's really okay. We can--

01:42.394 --> 01:44.563
It's okay.
Thank you so much for your time.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.440
Okay. Thank you.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.317
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.719
Yo. Can you talk to your dad, please?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.846
-He called you?
-He's been calling me, dude.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.641
-I told you not to give him your number.
-Like fucking ten years ago?

02:20.724 --> 02:22.601
-What do you want me to do?
-Just don't answer.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.437
-Dude, he will not stop calling.
-Turn your phone off.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.690
I have a daughter, dude.
I can't turn off my phone.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.568
-Can you-- He'll stop after a while, okay?
-Please pick up the phone.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.072
-I can't. I can't. Don't do that.
-I'm gonna pick up the phone. Yeah, I am.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.698
Yo, Artie. Hey. How's it going?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.118
Hello? Victor?

02:40.202 --> 02:41.203
Hi, Dad.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.373
Josh, Jesus Christ. Thank God.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.000
You can't be calling Victor
in the middle of the night.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.462
I'm having a heart attack. Do you hear me?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.298
Please. I'm scared.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.508
You sound fine.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.803
-I need to go to a hospital.
-Then go to a hospital.

02:58.762 --> 03:02.015
-I don't have a car.
-You had one last time I saw you.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.394
Yeah. Well, I mean, how long ago was that?

03:05.894 --> 03:09.606
Look. If you're really having
a heart attack, then you should call 911.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.692
No, they'll never get here in time.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.486
For Christ's sake,
you think I'm bullshitting you? I'm not.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.239
I haven't been able
to feel my left arm since 7:30.

03:17.322 --> 03:20.033
That's when I called the first time,
but you didn't pick up.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.660
And it's getting worse, all right?

03:21.743 --> 03:24.288
I'm having pain in my chest.
I can't breathe.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.541
I'm getting dizzy. Oh, Jesus.
I am getting dizzy right now.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.835
I'm spinning. I'm spinning. I'm spinning.

03:29.918 --> 03:34.214
Oh, my God. I'm spinning. I'm spinning.
I'm spinning. I'm spinning.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.978
Jesus.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.315
-Get in back.
-What?

03:51.398 --> 03:53.233
It's a pandemic.
You're not even wearing a mask.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.693
-Get in back.
-Okay.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.161
-That's a nice place.
-Will you drive, please?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.336
You took out a credit card in my name.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.420
What?

04:13.504 --> 04:15.714
I said you took out a credit card
in my name.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.512
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-They sent a collection agency after me.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.222
Those things are all scams.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.807
There was a charge
at Chez Jay's in Santa Monica.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.685
-A lot of people go to Jay's.
-I don't go there, you go there.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.104
So what? So they know
where your dad likes to eat.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.773
That's not hard to find out.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.776
I could tell you
where that guy's dad likes to eat.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.695
You know, give me till tomorrow.
I can get you that information.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.741
You didn't tell them your social, did you?

04:51.458 --> 04:52.960
All right, good night.

04:53.043 --> 04:56.547
What? You're just gonna drop me off
like some kind of cab driver?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.131
Yeah, you needed a ride.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.634
-Yeah.
-So go.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.302
You're not coming with me?

05:02.386 --> 05:04.680
No. I'm not coming with you
into a hospital right now.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.723
Do you pay any attention
to what's going on?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.434
Okay. Well, if you're not going,
I'm not going.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.479
-You're definitely going.
-Why? It's not gonna do any good.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.190
-It will if you're having a heart attack.
-Not necessarily.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.568
Okay. So you weren't
actually having a heart attack.

05:17.651 --> 05:21.071
Oh, no. I think I was.
I just don't think I am anymore.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.450
What, is that a bad thing?
Would you rather I be dying right now?

05:25.534 --> 05:28.829
I mean, I had some troubling symptoms.
They're subsiding, thank God.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.289
So let's go get a drink.

05:30.998 --> 05:31.999
-Get out.
-Come on.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.625
-Where you going?
-I'm going home.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.545
-What you gonna do there?
-Go to sleep. It's 2:00 in the morning.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.423
You go home right now,
you won't be able to sleep anyway.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.674
Come on. One nightcap.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.011
-Bars are closed.
-I know a place we can go. It's just a--

05:44.094 --> 05:47.181
You know I'm sober, right?
I've been sober since I was 13 years old.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.640
Do you not remember that?

05:50.475 --> 05:52.811
Okay, fine. Let's get coffee.

05:52.895 --> 05:56.231
-Everything is closed, Dad.
-Then we'll go to a fucking McDonald's.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.358
I'm not going inside a McDonald's!

06:02.988 --> 06:05.699
Would you just take one? I got it for you.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.825
No, thanks.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.661
Okay.
Well, I'll just drink from one of them

06:09.745 --> 06:11.288
in case you change your mind.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.874
-I'm not gonna change my mind.
-Okay.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.671
Oh, shit. I think I might've drank
from both of 'em now.

06:19.755 --> 06:22.007
-I don't care.
-All right.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.012
So... how are you?

06:27.513 --> 06:29.431
I'm fine. How are you?

06:29.515 --> 06:31.892
Well, how do you want me to answer that?

06:31.975 --> 06:35.812
Are you sincerely curious about how I am,
or are you just placating me?

06:36.730 --> 06:39.399
-What you up to these days?
-Why do you wanna know?

06:39.900 --> 06:43.612
I wanna know because
I am sincerely curious about how you are.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.324
I mean, you may not be curious about me
but, you know, I'm old, I'm boring.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.118
And you're young.
You're supposed to have shit going on.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.538
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.249
-Come on. You never--
-What do you want?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.460
I don't want anything.
I just wanna know about you.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.421
I wanna hear about your life.
You know, what's on your mind.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.841
You know, you're my son.
I wanna know everything.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.137
Come on. I'll take anything.
What did you do today?

07:09.221 --> 07:10.931
You baking bread like everyone else?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.642
I keep hearing
everybody's baking bread during all this.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.562
You know, everyone wants yeast
and no one can get it.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.230
You get all the yeast?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.566
Nope. Just working.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.777
-You're getting gigs? Like on Skype or--
-Not gigs. It's a job.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.738
Oh, no, I know it's hard work
when you do it for a living.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.323
I'm a teacher.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.742
Oh, right. Okay.
Like what? Like private lessons?

07:30.826 --> 07:33.787
I teach fifth grade.
Van Nuys West Elementary.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.880
Wait, you're--
you're teaching at a school?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.841
Yep. I mean, now it's on Zoom, but yep.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.386
-Don't you need credentials?
-I got a teaching degree.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.637
Jesus.

07:53.223 --> 07:57.019
And, like, how's it all going?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.273
I love it.

08:01.356 --> 08:04.568
Well, that is great.
Honestly, I'm so fucking proud of you.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.571
Like, you just made my day.
You just made my goddamn year.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.407
You-- You found something
you love doing and you're doing it.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.827
What else is there?
And you're teaching. You're helping kids.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.246
I feel like a good person
just being next to you.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.541
I wanna call everyone I know right now
and tell them my son's a teacher.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.626
Okay.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.671
Anyway, I think it's great
what you're doing.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.340
-I really do.
-Well, thanks.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.969
So what are you up to?

08:31.720 --> 08:32.971
Me? Oh, you know.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.850
I'm-- I've been reading a lot,
as a matter of fact.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.561
You know, just leaving the TV off,
opening a book.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.980
-You ever read Crime and Punishment?
-No.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.441
It's incredible. Like, very Russian.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.361
It's about this guy
who kills this old lady,

08:47.444 --> 08:48.862
and not for money or anything.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.323
He doesn't have
any practical reason for killing her.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.909
But the thing is,
you understand why he did it.

08:53.992 --> 08:57.329
He's losing his mind but, you know,
you can relate because

08:57.412 --> 09:00.040
-he doesn't have anybody to talk to--
-What are we doing?

09:00.541 --> 09:03.418
What-- Well, I'm talking.
We're getting to talk again.

09:03.502 --> 09:07.256
-But we're not talking about anything.
-Okay. What you wanna talk about?

09:07.339 --> 09:08.757
You know what? Why don't we--

09:08.841 --> 09:10.884
-I'll just turn back.
-How's Beth?

09:12.803 --> 09:15.013
-How are the kids?
-They're fine.

09:15.097 --> 09:18.433
-You know, I don't see them that often.
-Well, more often than me.

09:18.517 --> 09:22.980
I mean, I haven't even met the young one.
Sara, that's her name, right?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.024
-Yeah.
-Well, I'm sure I don't need to tell you.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.818
It causes me a lot of genuine pain

09:27.901 --> 09:30.320
to have a granddaughter
and not be allowed to see her.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.574
Any idea what that's about?
'Cause frankly, I'm confused.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.159
I mean, your sister's
always overreacted to things,

09:36.243 --> 09:38.203
but this is another order of magnitude.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.623
I show up late a couple of times
to the playground and all of a sudden--

09:41.707 --> 09:45.377
It wasn't that you were late.
You were high. And you dropped David.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.130
-Excuse me. I was not high on that day.
-I was there.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.966
-I know you've seen me high.
-You were 100% high that day.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.093
-You're not listening.
-What am I not listening to?

09:53.177 --> 09:56.013
I was trying to save
that other kid from falling.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.599
I don't know if you remember,
because you've obviously chosen

09:58.682 --> 10:00.976
to make this a story about
how I'm a fuck-up.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.521
But there was another kid climbing up
on that thing, whatever they call it,

10:04.605 --> 10:08.317
and the parents were nowhere to be found.
Probably on their phones or something.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.403
And I was the only one around.
And that kid started to fall, right?

10:11.486 --> 10:13.614
And I managed to get
one of my hands under him.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.658
If I hadn't done that, that kid
probably would've broken his neck.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.494
And yes, I did have to take
one of my hands off of David.

10:19.578 --> 10:23.081
And yes, he did slip down onto the ground,
you know, flat onto his back.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.917
No injury at all, just scared him.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.170
But apparently, the lesson is
I'm some kind of menace.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.466
It's not my decision.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.471
Well, I appreciate your support.

10:38.931 --> 10:42.476
Anyway, who cares about David?
He's always been a little shit.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.229
What's Sara like?

10:48.440 --> 10:51.818
She's totally different than David.
She's wonderful.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.738
Praise the Lord.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.615
So tell me about her.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.867
-How old is she now?
-She's five.

11:00.744 --> 11:01.745
Oh, God.

11:14.967 --> 11:15.968
She...

11:18.262 --> 11:21.056
She likes really quiet sounds.

11:22.307 --> 11:25.102
Like we'll... we'll just sit
in the backyard together

11:25.185 --> 11:26.520
if we ever get time alone,

11:26.603 --> 11:31.233
and we just listen to, you know,
the wind, or an owl or whatever.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.819
And we tell each other what we hear.

11:33.902 --> 11:39.491
And we try to talk in really quiet voices.
Like we see who can whisper most quietly.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.869
-And it's sort of this thing.
-Well, sure.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.038
-That's what we used to do.
-What's what we used to do?

11:45.539 --> 11:49.042
Who can whisper most quietly.
That was one of our games.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.963
-No, it wasn't.
-Yes, it was.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.716
-You kidding me? You don't remember?
-No.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.012
Well, you were very young.
The same age as her.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.389
She probably won't remember
doing it with you either

12:02.472 --> 12:04.933
-when she gets older.
-I think she will.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.646
You know, this is unfair.
This is insanity.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.441
I mean, you and me, absolutely,
when you were a little boy,

12:12.524 --> 12:14.401
we used to whisper back and forth.

12:14.484 --> 12:18.238
-Whoever was quieter would win the game.
-Sorry. I just don't remember that.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.119
I don't know what to say.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.705
I'm heartbroken.

12:33.629 --> 12:37.049
You probably don't remember
a lot of things we did together.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.012
You remember the night
I played the Troubadour?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.388
You bring it up a lot.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.725
No, not from me talking about it.
You were there.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.771
-Yeah, I know. I've seen the photo.
-Not from the photo. Do you remember it?

12:52.898 --> 12:54.858
Maybe. It's hard to tell. I was young.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.986
Well, you really wanted to go.
You remember that?

12:58.904 --> 13:03.033
I was getting ready to walk out the door,
and you really wanted to come with me.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.453
And I said to Ruth, "I want my son
to see me play the Troubadour."

13:06.537 --> 13:09.957
And she said you were too young.
You were already in bed. And I said...

13:10.958 --> 13:12.709
"Okay, I'm not gonna argue about this.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.920
This is the greatest night
of my artistic life.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.880
I'm not gonna sit here
and have an argument."

13:16.964 --> 13:20.467
So, I walked out the door.
I got in the car.

13:20.551 --> 13:24.221
I drove around the block
so that she could hear me drive off.

13:24.304 --> 13:28.183
I got out of the car.
I walked back to the house.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.103
I climbed in your bedroom window
and I got you out.

13:31.186 --> 13:35.107
And that's why you were in pajamas
in that photo, 'cause I snuck you out.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.735
Right? And we rode in the car together,

13:38.819 --> 13:43.240
just you and me,
over Coldwater Canyon into Hollywood.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.411
You don't remember that?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.999
-I might.
-Come on, try.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.379
It's hard to say.
Yeah, I might remember it.

13:58.547 --> 14:02.759
It was the greatest moment of my life.
I'm not exaggerating. It really was.

14:03.552 --> 14:07.389
Driving to the Troubadour
with you riding shotgun.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.726
That was the moment
that I still cherish to this day because,

14:10.809 --> 14:15.230
I mean, then, you know, the show itself--
It's not that it was disappointing.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.941
It just wasn't anything
to write home about, you know.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.195
The place wasn't full.
It was a Tuesday night.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.655
The crowd was a bunch of,
you know, trendy pricks,

14:23.739 --> 14:25.949
all thought they were
too badass rock and roll

14:26.033 --> 14:27.951
to appreciate a set of proper songwriting.

14:28.035 --> 14:32.331
I mean, unless you had a pair of fucking
Marshall Stacks and a wah-wah pedal

14:32.414 --> 14:35.459
and some stupid name like Slash or Puff,

14:35.542 --> 14:39.796
or whatever all those Zeppelin-wannabe
hair bands had, no one was interested.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.218
And there you have
the story of my godforsaken career.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.302
But you...

14:46.553 --> 14:48.013
You were having a blast.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.182
You were right there
on the side of the stage,

14:50.265 --> 14:52.309
'cause there's no backstage
at the Troubadour.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.810
So I could see you, right?

14:54.520 --> 14:58.649
And every time I got sick and tired of
these jerk-offs in their leather pants

14:58.732 --> 15:01.818
having their own conversations
while I was trying to sing,

15:02.653 --> 15:06.740
I'd look over, and I'd see you
looking right back at me.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.910
And it was so clear
from the look on your face that...

15:11.620 --> 15:14.623
that you were really listening
to the music, right? And...

15:17.835 --> 15:22.130
Like, do you remember that at least?
You remember me singing?

15:26.802 --> 15:27.803
Yeah.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.013
Yeah, you do, right?

15:32.516 --> 15:35.853
I mean, not to blow smoke up my own ass,
but from the day you were born,

15:35.936 --> 15:39.147
whenever I'd sing to you,
you'd tune right into it.

15:39.231 --> 15:43.110
I knew even before you could crawl
you were gonna be a musician.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.487
And I don't mean in the music business.
I mean a--

15:45.571 --> 15:50.534
You know, a real musician, an artist.
You always felt it so deeply.

15:51.368 --> 15:55.414
I used to just hold you
and walk around the house singing to you.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.583
That was the go-to move
when you were a baby.

15:57.666 --> 16:01.128
If you were upset, if you were crying,
it was, "Hand the boy over to me,"

16:01.211 --> 16:04.840
and after a couple of songs,
you know, you'd calm down.

16:06.175 --> 16:10.762
Then bedtime, I'd sing to you every night.
Same song for years.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.391
You remember that, right?

16:16.894 --> 16:18.478
You remember the song?

16:20.355 --> 16:22.649
-Moon river
-Dad.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.651
Dad, can you not?

16:24.735 --> 16:27.529
Wider than a mile

16:28.238 --> 16:33.869
I'm crossing you in style someday

16:34.536 --> 16:41.293
Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker

16:41.376 --> 16:48.175
Wherever you're goin'
I'm goin' your way

16:48.884 --> 16:52.930
Two drifters

16:53.013 --> 16:56.099
Off to see the world

16:56.183 --> 17:01.021
There's such a lot of world to see

17:01.522 --> 17:08.153
We're after the same rainbow's end

17:09.195 --> 17:12.074
Waitin' 'round the bend

17:12.156 --> 17:15.702
My huckleberry friend

17:15.786 --> 17:20.832
Moon river and me

17:24.627 --> 17:28.464
And then I'd say,
"Good night. I love you."

17:31.760 --> 17:33.220
And what would you say?

17:40.811 --> 17:43.480
I should get home.
I have work in the morning.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.067
Yeah. Me too.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.151
You too?

17:48.235 --> 17:51.071
-Yeah. What, you surprised?
-Yeah.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.992
Well, a lot can happen in a year or two.
I mean, what's it been, two years?

17:55.659 --> 17:57.744
-Almost three.
-Yeah, so...

18:02.833 --> 18:05.419
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.296
You said you have work.
What are you doing?

18:07.379 --> 18:11.675
Oh, yeah. I'm...
back to sales, same old game.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.303
You know, pounding the phones,
cashing the checks.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.971
It's a catastrophe.

18:16.054 --> 18:19.600
-Are people buying things in a pandemic?
-Supposedly some people are.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.186
But even before all this craziness,
the job had changed.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.896
There's no more dignity in it.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.899
The lead hates you
before they even pick up the phone.

18:26.982 --> 18:30.861
I mean, it-- it's unsustainable.
I'm gonna get out of it.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.487
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.906
I'm just saving up, you know.

18:33.989 --> 18:38.160
As soon as I can get together 20K,
if I can get it on time, I got a path.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.621
What?

18:41.330 --> 18:44.249
You just happen to be
trying to get together $20,000,

18:44.333 --> 18:46.752
and then you have a fake heart attack
and then you call me?

18:46.835 --> 18:50.088
You asked me what I was doing.
I didn't bring it up. You brought it up.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.590
I'm pursuing an opportunity,

18:51.673 --> 18:54.384
and I was telling you about it
in the course of conversation

18:54.468 --> 18:56.595
-because you asked. That's all.
-Okay.

18:56.678 --> 19:00.015
Come on.
It's Chuck Ferguson. You know Chuck.

19:00.516 --> 19:03.644
Come on, we spent that day
on his houseboat in the marina.

19:03.727 --> 19:07.189
-You remember that boat.
-I actually think I do, yeah.

19:07.272 --> 19:12.236
Yeah. So, Chuck's done really well
over the last 20 years in mini storage.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.238
People have all this shit they don't need.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.032
They don't wanna throw it away.
They gotta put it somewhere.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.660
Chuck's in deals
on a couple dozen of them.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.036
Mostly central California,

19:21.119 --> 19:24.623
but he's looking at a new one
in Lancaster. He told me about it.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.459
The management's no good,
so he'll buy it, increase revenue.

19:27.543 --> 19:30.045
Gets great returns.
Plus, it's recession-proof.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.965
They're actually doing great
during all this because, you know,

19:33.048 --> 19:34.925
when people start losing their houses,

19:35.008 --> 19:37.010
they still need somewhere
to put their shit.

19:37.094 --> 19:39.054
Thing pays for itself
in a couple of years.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.099
I'd have to ask Chuck,
but I could probably cut you in

19:42.182 --> 19:43.684
-if you want.
-See, there it is.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.770
-No, look, I'm not trying to push the--
-Dad, I don't have $20,000.

19:46.854 --> 19:49.231
-I don't have any dollars.
-I didn't come to you for money.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.316
Even if I did have money in the bank,
which I don't,

19:51.400 --> 19:54.319
I wouldn't give any to you, because
we both know what you would do with it.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.071
-That's not true.
-I'm going home.

19:56.572 --> 20:00.409
Hey, I said that's not--
You have no idea what my life is!

20:00.492 --> 20:01.493
Hey!

20:02.077 --> 20:04.079
Hey, don't walk away from me.

20:06.665 --> 20:11.712
Look, I'm-- I'm not like I used to be.
I'm not.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.008
You're exactly the same
as you've always been.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.718
And I can't help you.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.847
You know, you're just like me.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.683
No. I spent my life
trying not to be like you!

20:24.766 --> 20:26.977
You hate yourself, just like me!

20:28.520 --> 20:31.356
You can't stop thinking about
all the things you should've done

20:31.440 --> 20:32.858
and why you didn't do 'em.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.319
Now it's too late.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.238
And your brain goes round in circles,
just like mine does.

20:38.322 --> 20:41.742
The difference is,
I don't blame anybody but myself.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.120
And you blame me.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.748
And that's nice, isn't it?

20:48.665 --> 20:51.543
To have it be someone else's fault,
not your own.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.630
Yeah. Feels good.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.716
Sort of like a drug.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.019
Hey. Do you have somewhere to go?

21:11.563 --> 21:13.398
Don't worry about me.

21:50.853 --> 21:53.689
Josh! Hey, wake up.
I'm not gonna let you miss this.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.983
You can see it. Come on. Here we go.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.277
I know, I know it's hard,
but we can do it.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.864
It's gonna be worth it.
Didn't I tell you a meteor was coming?

22:01.947 --> 22:04.074
I told you this is the end of everything.

22:07.661 --> 22:12.332
There. See it?
I don't want you to be scared.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.877
It's not gonna hurt.
It's gonna happen so fast.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.922
It's gonna be the brightest fucking thing
you've ever seen, then it's gonna be over.

22:19.006 --> 22:22.801
But that's okay, because we got to see it.
And I love you.

22:22.885 --> 22:27.139
I love you both so much. I love you.
I love you.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.058
I love you.
