00:54.625 --> 00:55.875
<i>I was always wondering...</i>

00:56.375 --> 00:58.750
<i>what my future would be like.</i>

01:02.500 --> 01:03.167
Good morning, Truly.

01:03.292 --> 01:03.625
Morning.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.458
<i>Graduate from my dream school,</i>

01:05.583 --> 01:06.667
<i>fully develop my potential,</i>

01:06.792 --> 01:07.750
<i>realize my dreams.</i>

01:07.875 --> 01:10.208
Bravo!

01:11.583 --> 01:12.875
The lucrative deal in Shenzhen

01:13.583 --> 01:15.292
is finally signed to us.

01:15.750 --> 01:16.667
Listen,

01:17.375 --> 01:18.708
you should learn more from Truly.

01:18.833 --> 01:20.375
Do everything you can for the company.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.458
Fight for more good deals!

01:22.583 --> 01:23.333
Cheers!

01:23.458 --> 01:25.042
Thank you boss.

01:25.167 --> 01:25.792
Thank you.

01:25.917 --> 01:26.500
WOW!

01:26.625 --> 01:28.208
What is this, Truly?

01:28.333 --> 01:29.667
So shiny!

01:30.208 --> 01:31.792
Congratulations!

01:32.500 --> 01:34.917
Double good news!

01:35.500 --> 01:37.875
<i>And have a perfect relationship.</i>

01:38.875 --> 01:41.167
<i>My life will shine...</i>

01:41.292 --> 01:42.583
<i>like a diamond.</i>

01:54.833 --> 01:56.292
Hsin, go tell her.

01:57.625 --> 01:59.083
We've worked over time for so many days...

01:59.208 --> 02:00.167
Truly.

02:00.792 --> 02:02.458
Can we go now?

02:02.792 --> 02:04.750
Sure, bye bye!

02:04.875 --> 02:05.667
Bye bye.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.792
See you tomorrow. -Bye bye.

02:06.917 --> 02:07.750
Thank you, Truly!

02:07.875 --> 02:08.625
Hurray!

02:08.750 --> 02:09.667
Shall we got for spicy hot pot?

02:09.792 --> 02:10.250
Sure.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.125
Which restaurant? <i>I'll</i> make a reservation.

02:12.250 --> 02:12.833
Hello?

02:12.958 --> 02:14.292
What time do you think it is?

02:14.625 --> 02:16.208
Why are you still in the office?

02:16.333 --> 02:17.667
I've been waiting for 5 minutes.

02:17.792 --> 02:18.500
Sorry.

02:18.625 --> 02:19.667
<i>I'll</i> go to the restaurant now.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.458
If you're not here in 5 minutes, <i>I'll</i> leave.

02:21.583 --> 02:22.708
That's not enough time!

02:22.833 --> 02:25.083
<i>It'll</i> take me half an hour to get there.

02:25.208 --> 02:26.917
Hello?

02:27.792 --> 02:28.833
Shit.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.292
Conference call with Edinburgh at midnight.

02:32.417 --> 02:34.667
Your team will stay to prepare for it.

02:34.792 --> 02:35.917
Butlhaveu.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.417
<i>I'll do it</i> now.

02:52.958 --> 02:54.458
Look at Truly.

02:54.792 --> 02:55.708
What a role model!

02:58.500 --> 02:59.542
Yes, sir.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.167
Everyone.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.042
Let's stay a little longer to work on it.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.208
Go! Go! Go!

03:07.333 --> 03:09.458
Earlier done, earlier home.

03:13.542 --> 03:15.583
<i>No one ever told me,</i>

03:15.708 --> 03:17.333
<i>the truth is...when you grow up,</i>

03:17.458 --> 03:20.250
<i>it's likely you'll have a not-so-good job,</i>

03:20.375 --> 03:22.750
<i>be in a not-so-good relationship,</i>

03:23.208 --> 03:26.833
<i>and live a not-so-good life.</i>

03:27.583 --> 03:29.042
...dunno what he wants to eat.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.500
It seems like Hsin is on a diet...

03:32.375 --> 03:35.958
Go! Go !Go! Early done, early home.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.375
She's the one who told us to stay.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.167
I won't get her bonus anyway.

03:40.292 --> 03:42.542
The manager told us to learn from Truly.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.500
Fuck! Who wants to learn from her?

03:44.625 --> 03:47.167
Working overtime for little salary.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.042
She treats the company as her family.

03:49.167 --> 03:50.875
The company treats her as animal.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.208
To be honest,

03:54.333 --> 03:55.417
I feel bad for people like her.

03:55.542 --> 03:58.250
I hope I won't be like her when I get old.

03:58.375 --> 04:01.333
Who wants to be like her! Miserable.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.292
<i>I think...</i>

04:06.417 --> 04:08.208
<i>if I ran into this woman</i>

04:08.333 --> 04:10.750
<i>when I was 18,</i>

04:11.208 --> 04:13.333
<i>I would have definitely laughed at her</i>

04:13.458 --> 04:15.417
<i>like them, without mercy.</i>

04:17.708 --> 04:19.666
<i>Yabiyabi. Good evening everyone.</i>

04:19.791 --> 04:21.166
<i>This is Guangyu.</i>

04:21.500 --> 04:24.292
<i>Do you like who you are now?</i>

04:25.292 --> 04:27.167
<i>When we grow up,</i>

04:27.292 --> 04:30.208
<i>we become sophiscated
and tend to compromise</i>

04:30.333 --> 04:31.583
<i>in order to survive.</i>

04:31.708 --> 04:34.792
<i>We become someone we don't recognize.</i>

04:36.375 --> 04:39.167
<i>Would you sometimes
miss the time when you</i>

04:39.292 --> 04:40.917
<i>were rather naive and dared to dream?</i>

04:42.625 --> 04:45.792
<i>Is that part of you still there?</i>

04:46.792 --> 04:49.458
<i>Do you still remember those people</i>

04:49.583 --> 04:50.708
<i>who played an important role in your life?</i>

04:50.833 --> 04:51.875
<i>(My dream: Go to Andy Lau's concert...)</i>

04:53.417 --> 04:54.583
<i>Tonight,</i>

04:54.708 --> 04:56.458
<i>we'll start our program with</i>

04:56.583 --> 04:58.583
<i>this song from me to you all.</i>

04:58.708 --> 05:00.583
<i>A song we haven't heard for a long time.</i>

05:00.708 --> 05:03.542
<i>"Forget Love Water" by Andy Lau.</i>

05:34.708 --> 05:36.667
<i>Good morning. Here is the latest news...</i>

05:36.958 --> 05:38.833
<i>yesterday Alec Su of The Little Tigers</i>

05:38.958 --> 05:42.833
<i>said he dropped out of Taiwan University.</i>

05:42.958 --> 05:45.292
<i>The whole entertainment world is in shock.</i>

06:08.250 --> 06:10.167
Are you giving birth? Are you done or not?

06:10.292 --> 06:11.542
I'm done!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.417
<i>Back then, I was turning 18</i>

06:17.542 --> 06:19.917
<i>and truly understood something important:</i>

06:20.458 --> 06:21.833
<i>History has proven that, there are mainly</i>

06:21.958 --> 06:23.750
<i>two types of young girls in the world.</i>

06:23.875 --> 06:25.542
Hey, here she comes.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.542
Wow! How elegant.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.500
Oh my God! She's gorgeous!

06:29.625 --> 06:31.292
So cute!

06:32.375 --> 06:34.583
<i>Pretty girls who are popular...</i>

06:37.208 --> 06:38.167
D0n't g0!

06:38.417 --> 06:39.375
Wait for me! -Tao Minmin!

06:39.500 --> 06:40.125
<i>And</i>

06:40.250 --> 06:41.792
<i>those who are not pretty.</i>

06:44.292 --> 06:45.542
<i>My name is Lin Truly.</i>

06:46.667 --> 06:47.750
<i>Sorry!</i>

06:48.167 --> 06:49.875
<i>I'm the one who just fell on the street.</i>

06:51.792 --> 06:53.375
<i>If you're a guy,</i>

06:53.792 --> 06:55.667
<i>let me tell you a story of an ordinary girl</i>

06:55.792 --> 06:59.667
<i>who you've never bothered to care about</i>

06:59.792 --> 07:01.917
<i>and her ordinary life.</i>

07:25.708 --> 07:27.167
<i>Back then, the most important decision</i>

07:27.292 --> 07:29.333
<i>we had to make every day</i>

07:29.458 --> 07:32.125
<i>was what to eat for breakfast.</i>

07:32.250 --> 07:33.292
Can you please hurry up?

07:33.417 --> 07:34.792
Is it that tough to decide?

07:37.208 --> 07:39.250
<i>The biggest lie we had ever told</i>

07:39.375 --> 07:40.833
<i>was on the day of exam,</i>

07:40.958 --> 07:42.167
<i>we'd say...</i>

07:42.375 --> 07:43.750
I didn't prepare for it.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.458
Neither did I.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.333
I thought we were having math exam.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.708
<i>The most luxurious thing to do,</i>

07:49.833 --> 07:51.667
<i>was to go shopping in the bookstore.</i>

07:51.792 --> 07:52.792
<i>Back then,</i>

07:52.917 --> 07:55.875
<i>that was our department store.</i>

07:56.583 --> 07:58.208
<i>The biggest dream we had</i>

07:58.333 --> 07:58.833
<i>was to meet our idols</i>

07:58.958 --> 08:00.292
<i>one day.</i>

08:00.417 --> 08:03.583
The shame of being shameless
is shameless

08:05.625 --> 08:07.208
<i>Somehow young girls of that time</i>

08:07.333 --> 08:09.875
<i>had some kind of fantasy.</i>

08:10.583 --> 08:12.292
<i>We believed whoever collected most photos</i>

08:12.417 --> 08:13.042
<i>would be the most qualified person</i>

08:13.167 --> 08:15.167
<i>to marry him.</i>

08:17.542 --> 08:18.667
<i>This is Small.</i>

08:18.792 --> 08:20.417
<i>Although large in size,</i>

08:20.542 --> 08:22.500
<i>she is a super romantic teenage girl.</i>

08:22.792 --> 08:24.417
<i>Kaneshiro Takeshi is her ex,</i>

08:24.542 --> 08:25.250
<i>and now</i>

08:25.375 --> 08:27.625
<i>Aaron Kwok is her fiance.</i>

08:31.792 --> 08:33.417
Even I am not married yet,

08:34.167 --> 08:35.375
how come you already have a husband?

08:36.375 --> 08:37.582
Boss Lau...

08:38.207 --> 08:40.792
However hard you try, he'll never reply.

08:42.292 --> 08:45.167
What you do is called shameless.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.792
<i>This is Meimei.</i>

08:51.917 --> 08:53.417
<i>Very cheerful,</i>

08:53.542 --> 08:56.500
<i>but...almost too cheerful.</i>

08:57.917 --> 09:00.208
Girls, where are you going?

09:01.792 --> 09:04.750
<i>Back in our teenage life, we were always</i>

09:04.875 --> 09:07.583
<i>doing silly things apart from studying.</i>

09:08.375 --> 09:09.500
<i>And this is the silliest</i>

09:09.625 --> 09:11.333
<i>among all.</i>

09:12.667 --> 09:14.708
Ouyang is coming. He's so handsome.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.667
Hey, be quiet. Come on.

09:16.875 --> 09:19.000
He has a style. He's here.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.667
<i>There is always a boy like this,</i>

09:24.792 --> 09:26.542
<i>in every teenage girl's life.</i>

09:30.667 --> 09:31.625
Thank you.

09:36.708 --> 09:37.708
It's on me.

09:38.417 --> 09:39.292
6O please. -60.

09:39.417 --> 09:40.375
6O please. -60.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.417
<i>Somehow they're always basketball players,</i>

09:51.167 --> 09:55.208
<i>secret crush for every girl in the school.</i>

09:58.667 --> 10:01.083
I feel Ouyang is looking at me.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.667
I think he's looking at me.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.667
<i>We can giggle for the whole day</i>

10:10.792 --> 10:12.375
<i>just because of a look from him.</i>

10:19.667 --> 10:21.708
Dear all, can you please stop helping

10:21.833 --> 10:24.250
those idiots send love letters

10:24.375 --> 10:26.250
to our Minmin?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.792
Especially this kind of idiot,

10:27.917 --> 10:30.208
who misused "disney" for "destiny".

10:31.875 --> 10:34.250
<i>This kind of orginary, simple life</i>

10:34.375 --> 10:37.250
<i>was turned upside down by that very letter.</i>

10:41.292 --> 10:42.958
<i>(to Lin Truly)</i>

10:51.167 --> 10:53.042
<i>This is a chain letter from South African</i>

10:53.167 --> 10:54.833
<i>missionary Antnony DE Croud.</i>

10:54.958 --> 10:57.292
<i>Now the good luck is bestowed on you.</i>

10:57.417 --> 10:59.042
<i>Send 5 copies to your friends,</i>

10:59.167 --> 11:00.167
<i>and the good luck is yours.</i>

11:00.292 --> 11:02.917
<i>Otherwise disasters will be waiting for you.</i>

11:03.500 --> 11:04.375
<i>In 1979, Mr. Chen from Taiwan did not</i>

11:04.500 --> 11:07.167
<i>take the letter seriously and tore it apart.</i>

11:07.292 --> 11:09.250
<i>...he died in a car accident the next day.</i>

11:09.375 --> 11:12.458
<i>In 1963, Flayre from Holland burnt it...</i>

11:12.583 --> 11:14.583
<i>3 days later, his mother started to...</i>

11:14.708 --> 11:16.208
<i>suffer an incurable disease.</i>

11:26.167 --> 11:27.667
<i>(You still have three days. Good luck.)</i>

11:34.708 --> 11:37.042
<i>The person I want to send chain letter to</i>

11:37.167 --> 11:38.458
<i>the most, is Lin Sincere.</i>

11:38.792 --> 11:40.042
<i>My brother.</i>

11:40.167 --> 11:41.708
Your brother advanced

11:41.833 --> 11:44.958
5 places in this exam.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.583
Last time he got the lowest score. Besides,

11:47.708 --> 11:49.625
he's spent 7 years on a 5-year program...

11:49.750 --> 11:51.083
Don't you talk back!

11:51.208 --> 11:53.167
Only if you could get half of the grade

11:53.292 --> 11:54.375
of Tao Minmin's.

11:54.625 --> 11:55.958
30 points.

11:56.875 --> 11:57.708
You even tried to alter it

11:57.833 --> 11:58.958
with a different color.

11:59.958 --> 12:01.292
How stupid!

12:01.417 --> 12:03.333
My red pen ran out of ink.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.250
Couldn't you borrow one from your teacher?

12:05.375 --> 12:05.958
That's right.

12:07.792 --> 12:08.792
Take it.

12:09.375 --> 12:10.667
Thank you mom.

12:10.792 --> 12:11.500
Take one more.

12:11.625 --> 12:12.625
Thank you dad!

12:15.750 --> 12:18.333
<i>Many of you probably
had the same thought,</i>

12:18.792 --> 12:22.458
<i>"Am I'm really my parents' child?"</i>

12:22.583 --> 12:25.167
<i>But if my brother's family is really ruined,</i>

12:25.292 --> 12:26.917
<i>I might suffer as well.</i>

12:27.542 --> 12:29.208
<i>So I dismissed that idea.</i>

12:30.625 --> 12:31.625
<i>Therefore...</i>

12:32.208 --> 12:33.458
<i>I gave the first letter</i>

12:33.583 --> 12:34.958
<i>to him.</i>

12:36.500 --> 12:37.583
Lin Truly.

12:38.417 --> 12:39.583
Question 1:

12:40.375 --> 12:43.167
If the balls are put in the order of red,

12:43.292 --> 12:45.625
blue, green, what's the color of ball 555?

12:46.792 --> 12:48.333
It's ok if you don't know the answer,

12:49.625 --> 12:52.375
but why drawing it like this?

12:53.208 --> 12:53.667
Don't you dodge!

12:53.792 --> 12:55.208
<i>There must be a psycho teacher like this</i>

12:55.333 --> 12:57.375
<i>in everyone's school years.</i>

12:57.792 --> 12:59.500
<i>"Wang Baidan"</i>

12:59.875 --> 13:02.167
<i>Our home room teacher and math teacher.</i>

13:02.375 --> 13:03.708
<i>We all call him</i>

13:03.833 --> 13:05.458
<i>"Wang Badan" (asshole)</i>

13:07.167 --> 13:08.375
I haven't even started!

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
Come back.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.750
You're even louder than me.

13:33.167 --> 13:34.458
<i>I gave the second letter</i>

13:34.583 --> 13:35.875
<i>to Tao Minmin.</i>

13:36.625 --> 13:38.458
<i>It's definitely not because I envy her</i>

13:38.583 --> 13:40.208
<i>for her beauty or popularity.</i>

13:40.333 --> 13:41.333
<i>Not even because</i>

13:41.458 --> 13:43.208
<i>she's that girl who could</i>

13:43.333 --> 13:44.708
<i>get his attention.</i>

13:47.917 --> 13:52.208
<i>It's simply because she lives next door.</i>

13:52.583 --> 13:54.292
<i>Right on my way home.</i>

14:08.542 --> 14:10.042
What? A good student?

14:10.208 --> 14:11.750
Do the recycling.

14:17.583 --> 14:18.667
Hey you.

14:19.583 --> 14:20.708
Kick it back.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.708
Ouyang Extraordinary.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.542
I might've seen this disgusting name before.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.042
<i>As there is a "God" in every school,</i>

14:40.167 --> 14:42.875
<i>there is also a "boss".</i>

14:47.375 --> 14:48.375
Stand up.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.417
<i>Hsu Taiyu.</i>

14:56.708 --> 14:59.208
<i>Last number of the last class in 3rd grade.</i>

14:59.500 --> 15:02.250
<i>He's the boss who leads our school in</i>

15:02.375 --> 15:03.833
<i>turf wars and charge others protection fee.</i>

15:04.375 --> 15:04.708
<i>Rumor has it that</i>

15:04.833 --> 15:08.292
<i>he fights, runs away from home,
he's on drug</i>

15:08.417 --> 15:09.792
<i>has killed people, set fire...</i>

15:09.917 --> 15:12.542
<i>So notorious that no school wants him,</i>

15:12.667 --> 15:14.417
<i>except for First High School...</i>

15:14.750 --> 15:16.042
How daring are you to be here.

15:16.167 --> 15:17.500
You despise us
the 12 Masters of First High?

15:18.792 --> 15:21.250
What about Ten Brothers
from Chuoshui River?

15:21.875 --> 15:23.167
Kill them.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.833
<i>He's even appointed as school patrol</i>

15:35.958 --> 15:37.042
Indecent clothing.

15:37.167 --> 15:38.125
Eating while walking.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.417
Studying too hard.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.500
Too matured body.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.292
<i>First High...</i>

15:45.417 --> 15:47.792
<i>has since been trapped
in the devil's clutches.</i>

15:49.167 --> 15:50.375
Recycle it!

16:00.750 --> 16:01.875
Hey, what are you doing?

16:02.167 --> 16:03.875
Why bully others like this?

16:04.833 --> 16:05.917
What the hell are you guys doing?

16:06.917 --> 16:08.333
Here comes the director,

16:08.917 --> 16:10.542
let's go.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.083
Come on! Go, go.

16:20.875 --> 16:21.958
Chicken.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.542
<i>Therefore...</i>

16:30.875 --> 16:32.625
<i>I decided to send him the third letter.</i>

16:50.792 --> 16:51.500
Guile.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.375
G your mother.

16:59.875 --> 17:00.958
Sorry

17:07.708 --> 17:09.166
<i>(to Hsu Taiyu)</i>

17:12.166 --> 17:13.375
it's pink

17:13.750 --> 17:15.208
with fragrance.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.416
Love letter?

17:17.541 --> 17:18.333
Aren't you over the moon, boss?

17:18.458 --> 17:20.416
Over what! Get lost.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.333
Who has the guts to write him a love letter?

17:26.458 --> 17:27.833
Oh, he was even blushing.

17:27.958 --> 17:29.792
Blushing! Hahahaha

17:29.917 --> 17:31.667
He must be over the moon now.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.583
Not just over the moon...

17:33.708 --> 17:37.292
Over the whole world!

17:39.167 --> 17:43.500
Boss.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.125
Did you hear about it already?

17:46.250 --> 17:48.625
Hsu Taiyu had a car accident yesterday.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.417
Lin Truly...

18:08.375 --> 18:10.667
If I find out who cursed boss,

18:10.917 --> 18:13.583
<i>I'll</i> make sure to break his arms and legs.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.792
Sorry, she needs to take her medicine.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.458
Lin Truly, let's go.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.375
Why are you so heavy!

18:25.917 --> 18:26.583
Go.

18:27.375 --> 18:28.083
Boss, watch your step.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.083
Someone is spreading the rumor,

18:30.208 --> 18:31.750
saying this year's school anniversary

18:32.250 --> 18:35.167
will be suspended due to track renovation.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.167
Let me clarify it here.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.500
This year, school anniversary festival

18:40.375 --> 18:42.333
will be held as scheduled.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.542
Since I'm retiring from First High soon.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.167
The new director will take over

18:51.583 --> 18:54.125
the responsibility as the organizer.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.625
Last but not least, do not leave yet.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.083
School patrol is now conducting

18:59.208 --> 19:03.375
a surprise safety inspection.

19:12.208 --> 19:13.167
Dahe.

19:13.292 --> 19:14.208
Breast baring.

19:15.292 --> 19:16.250
That's too nasty.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.125
Make a note.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.375
Confiscate it.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.417
Hey you.

20:07.458 --> 20:08.792
We need to talk.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.375
Where are we going?

20:21.583 --> 20:23.333
Just follow us.

20:24.792 --> 20:25.583
No!

20:25.708 --> 20:27.875
Enjoy, boss.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.250
In 1979,

20:42.375 --> 20:43.708
Mr. Chen from Taiwan...

20:43.833 --> 20:45.042
did not take the letter seriously

20:45.167 --> 20:46.625
and tore it apart.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.500
The next day he died in a car accident.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.542
So it's you.

21:04.167 --> 21:05.167
Whose films do you like?

21:06.625 --> 21:07.083
What?

21:07.208 --> 21:07.875
Who?

21:10.958 --> 21:13.417
S...Stephen Chow.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.458
Which film do you like best?

21:18.583 --> 21:19.667
All..."All's Well, Ends Well".

21:19.792 --> 21:21.292
How many "all"s?

21:21.417 --> 21:23.167
One.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.708
Your birthday?

21:27.958 --> 21:29.792
April 19.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.958
Good, you're honest.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.417
What don't you like about me?

21:36.333 --> 21:37.833
Nothing.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.375
L...think...you're

21:40.917 --> 21:41.958
tall...

21:42.375 --> 21:43.208
and cute...

21:43.417 --> 21:44.417
and if I look closely...

21:44.542 --> 21:46.167
You even look a bit like Andy Lau?

21:52.292 --> 21:53.583
I know you sent the chain letter to me

21:53.958 --> 21:55.583
because of him.

22:00.292 --> 22:01.417
No!

22:01.792 --> 22:02.833
What no?

22:03.500 --> 22:04.792
I can't change the film?

22:10.167 --> 22:11.375
Would you like to change the film?

22:12.833 --> 22:13.708
Yes, to...

22:13.833 --> 22:15.625
All..."All's Well, Ends Well".

22:15.750 --> 22:16.792
Sure, just a moment.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.375
Let's...

22:23.708 --> 22:25.167
be friends.

22:26.542 --> 22:27.542
What?

22:30.833 --> 22:32.500
You just introduced yourself.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.708
<i>In Taiyu's dictionary, friend means</i>

22:39.833 --> 22:42.167
<i>unconditional devotion.</i>

22:46.792 --> 22:48.875
<i>In order to protect Ouyang,</i>

22:49.375 --> 22:51.458
<i>I'm willing to listen to Hsu Taiyu.</i>

22:51.583 --> 22:52.875
<i>Be his slave.</i>

22:56.375 --> 22:56.833
Auntie.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.042
One sesame noodle.

22:58.167 --> 22:58.667
Don't put sesame dressing and noodles

22:58.792 --> 23:00.458
together. They need to be separated.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.250
No fatty no lean for braised pork rice

23:02.375 --> 23:03.250
but half half.

23:03.375 --> 23:04.250
And veggie tofu soup without spring onion.

23:04.375 --> 23:06.583
Two eggs in it but don't beat it.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.292
Thank you.

23:11.833 --> 23:14.708
If no spring onion in veggie tofu soup,

23:16.375 --> 23:18.458
why have it on sesame noodles?

23:18.792 --> 23:19.958
Get a new one!

23:31.208 --> 23:32.292
Wait.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.500
This is your reward.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.500
Autographed photo of Andy Lau.

23:41.958 --> 23:44.208
It's Andy Low from the TV show.

24:04.375 --> 24:05.500
Here.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.500
I thought you forgot your book for math

24:10.625 --> 24:11.833
excursion, where are the other people?

24:13.625 --> 24:14.708
Idiot.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.375
What kind of excursion for math class?

24:17.958 --> 24:18.917
Hurry UP-

24:19.375 --> 24:20.500
The movie starts at 2.

24:21.958 --> 24:22.708
Ah...

24:22.917 --> 24:25.375
The bell rang already, I'm going back.

24:25.625 --> 24:26.708
Then who'll get food for me?

24:26.833 --> 24:27.625
Who'll collect my trash?

24:27.750 --> 24:28.417
Who'll fan for me?

24:31.625 --> 24:32.667
I can't climb the wall.

24:32.792 --> 24:33.583
So...

24:33.708 --> 24:35.292
I really can't do this.

24:37.583 --> 24:38.792
You wanna die?

24:38.917 --> 24:40.500
What if the teacher finds out?

24:40.625 --> 24:42.250
I've never skipped class in my life...

24:42.375 --> 24:44.500
If you've never done that in your uniform,

24:44.625 --> 24:47.417
you'll regret in the future.

24:49.875 --> 24:51.625
You're so heavy.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.042
Hurry UP-

25:25.167 --> 25:26.167
Don't goof off.

25:26.583 --> 25:29.500
Can I go back for tutorial class?

25:33.958 --> 25:35.625
Attach yourself to the end of the line.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.375
Hsu Taiyu, I had enough!

25:57.958 --> 25:58.917
Are you ok?

25:59.292 --> 26:00.417
Are you alright?

26:03.958 --> 26:05.250
I'm 0k...

26:06.458 --> 26:08.417
Then go get squid balls for me!

26:10.667 --> 26:12.208
Hsu Taiyu!

26:16.583 --> 26:17.667
Thank you.

26:18.958 --> 26:21.417
Go away! What are you looking at?
Sit down.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.458
Quickly!

26:31.208 --> 26:31.833
Sit!

26:32.917 --> 26:33.750
Sit tight!

26:34.375 --> 26:35.208
Hsu Taiyu.

26:35.583 --> 26:36.917
Don't you dare touch my gal...

26:38.333 --> 26:38.833
What's wrong!

26:38.958 --> 26:40.833
Holding hands when roller skating?

26:42.500 --> 26:44.292
How can you do it without holding hands?

26:44.417 --> 26:45.542
Shut up!

26:46.417 --> 26:47.250
What?

26:48.542 --> 26:49.417
Kill him.

26:56.542 --> 26:57.375
Sakuraki.

27:19.708 --> 27:20.583
Boss

27:30.458 --> 27:31.417
Hsu Taiyu!

27:54.458 --> 27:55.458
Boss, are you ok?

27:55.583 --> 27:56.542
It's 0k.

27:59.833 --> 28:00.958
Hsu Taiyu!

28:01.708 --> 28:04.250
If I didn't have final exam this afternoon,

28:05.583 --> 28:06.792
<i>I'll</i> never let you get away with it!

28:06.917 --> 28:08.500
Let's go back to study!

28:19.583 --> 28:20.875
<i>I'll</i> get you, you motherfucker!

28:25.708 --> 28:28.500
<i>(No distinction of classes in teaching.)</i>

28:38.917 --> 28:40.167
Miss Lin.

28:40.292 --> 28:41.958
I know you're innocent.

28:42.583 --> 28:44.167
If you to tell me

28:44.500 --> 28:46.417
what happened at the skating rink,

28:46.792 --> 28:47.833
you won't be punished.

28:48.375 --> 28:49.500
L---

28:51.750 --> 28:52.708
Cold.

29:05.708 --> 29:08.542
I don't...remember

29:09.750 --> 29:11.625
what happened when where who at all.

29:14.292 --> 29:16.875
Right. You went to indecent place

29:17.458 --> 29:18.750
during school hours. Your punishment is

29:18.875 --> 29:20.417
1O hours of pool cleaning.

29:20.542 --> 29:21.208
Go back to your class.

29:23.583 --> 29:25.250
Thank you, sir.

29:31.792 --> 29:33.292
What were you doing?

29:34.792 --> 29:36.875
School patrol skipped the class?

29:38.667 --> 29:40.958
Hey, school patrol!

29:41.208 --> 29:42.458
Lin Truly!

29:42.583 --> 29:45.250
How come you were in the office with Taiyu?

29:45.375 --> 29:47.375
Shhhh...for what?

29:47.500 --> 29:48.500
We can't what?

29:49.500 --> 29:50.875
I see! How many words?

29:51.833 --> 29:52.708
Ouyang!

29:52.833 --> 29:54.250
Quvang what?

29:55.375 --> 29:56.458
See...

29:57.750 --> 29:58.792
."y0urface

29:59.833 --> 30:01.542
We can't let Ouyang see you.

30:02.625 --> 30:03.625
Yes!

30:03.750 --> 30:04.833
Lin Truly?

30:18.250 --> 30:19.458
I didn't know you're actually pretty good.

30:21.292 --> 30:22.333
I also like roller skating too.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.667
Next time we can go together.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.250
Lin Truly.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.542
Ouyang knows your name!

30:34.667 --> 30:36.333
And even asked you out...

30:39.167 --> 30:40.208
Praised by Ouyang for skipping class...

30:40.333 --> 30:41.875
Strangely amazing.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.458
Look, love fire is burning.

30:45.583 --> 30:47.417
Love fire is bouncing.

30:47.542 --> 30:49.333
Warmly, our hearts

30:49.458 --> 30:52.375
embrace each other.

30:55.750 --> 30:56.833
I told my mom...

30:58.708 --> 31:00.250
Did she give her approval?

31:00.625 --> 31:01.542
Yes.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.125
But...

31:04.250 --> 31:06.250
What if the teacher finds out

31:06.375 --> 31:07.500
about us...?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.625
This is not allowed by the school.

31:11.958 --> 31:13.083
Don't worry.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.250
I am the father.

31:14.375 --> 31:15.792
<i>I'll</i> take the responsibility.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.542
So glad you're here.

31:20.458 --> 31:21.375
You should go now!

31:21.500 --> 31:22.833
Others can come here anytime.

31:22.958 --> 31:23.958
They'll find us suspicious.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.958
Was someone here?

31:40.167 --> 31:41.250
What should we do?

31:41.375 --> 31:43.417
Will people find out about us?

31:44.625 --> 31:45.458
We'll be fine.

31:45.583 --> 31:47.333
Let's get out of here now.

32:51.625 --> 32:53.292
What the fuck are you looking at!

32:55.792 --> 32:57.667
Did you just try to drown yourself?

32:57.792 --> 32:59.500
Just for that prick?

33:01.375 --> 33:02.917
Then what on earth are you crying for?

33:03.375 --> 33:05.333
You're the silly one...

33:19.875 --> 33:22.583
Do you have it with you all the time?

33:24.625 --> 33:28.333
If you never had beer in your uniform...

33:28.458 --> 33:29.708
<i>I'll</i> regret in the future.

33:30.458 --> 33:31.708
I got it.

33:46.167 --> 33:47.542
You wrote this?

33:51.167 --> 33:52.792
You like Tao Minmin?

34:03.208 --> 34:05.292
Dear Tao Minmin:

34:05.667 --> 34:09.208
When you were trying the hairpin yesterday,

34:09.583 --> 34:11.333
I really longed to touch...

34:11.458 --> 34:13.542
the beautiful black hair of yours!

34:14.583 --> 34:16.250
You're so sick.

34:17.333 --> 34:18.417
Because...

34:18.542 --> 34:21.167
it's so nice to meet you

34:21.292 --> 34:22.958
do you know that?

34:23.792 --> 34:26.583
Quoting lyrics...you really suck.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.667
Now we're both kind of...

34:34.250 --> 34:35.917
Association of the Dumped members.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.417
For the first time I think you're clever.

34:48.750 --> 34:49.875
What?

34:50.667 --> 34:52.375
Let's help them break up.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.750
If you help me chase Tao Minmin...

34:54.875 --> 34:55.708
wouldn't that make your Ouyang

34:55.833 --> 34:56.750
single again?

35:18.375 --> 35:19.542
Sorry! Sorry!

35:23.750 --> 35:24.625
Excuse me!

35:55.708 --> 35:57.292
Did you bring powdered milk and bottle?

35:57.417 --> 35:58.417
Yeah.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.833
Hsu Taiyu!

36:04.417 --> 36:05.417
Sorry...

36:05.542 --> 36:06.708
Mommy's late.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.667
You must be starving.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.708
Slowly. . .slowly.

36:11.375 --> 36:12.458
Look at the eyes...

36:12.583 --> 36:13.542
So adorable.

36:13.667 --> 36:14.792
Just like you.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.833
Should we take it to the vet for shots?

36:19.458 --> 36:22.375
Yeah. Let's do it after school soon.

36:22.625 --> 36:23.625
OK.

36:29.792 --> 36:32.375
We misunderstood them.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.667
There is nothing between them.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.625
Just a PUPPY-

36:36.375 --> 36:38.125
Having a dog now together means

36:38.250 --> 36:39.750
they'll walk the dog together. Get closer.

36:39.875 --> 36:42.125
Then the dog will have more puppies.

36:42.250 --> 36:43.667
We can't let this happen.

36:43.792 --> 36:45.417
Say that again. What do you think of me?

36:46.917 --> 36:48.208
You're tall...

36:48.333 --> 36:49.375
and cute...

36:49.708 --> 36:51.167
If I look closely...

36:51.583 --> 36:53.458
You even look a bit like Andy Lau.

37:12.417 --> 37:13.708
Tao Minmin!

37:16.375 --> 37:17.458
The campus belle!

37:19.417 --> 37:20.792
So pretty!

37:55.833 --> 37:57.375
Our boss is hot!

38:03.167 --> 38:04.375
Tao Minmin.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.917
Wanna be my gal?

38:07.167 --> 38:16.792
<i>Say yes Say yes\\(U VUL I NIMNIM OAT)</i>

38:28.208 --> 38:29.792
If you dare to tell others what happened,

38:29.917 --> 38:31.708
you are dead.

38:32.333 --> 38:34.667
Don't you tell others boss is dumped.

38:34.792 --> 38:35.792
Let me repeat.

38:35.917 --> 38:37.750
Don't you tell others boss is dumped.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.417
What the fuck!

38:39.542 --> 38:40.708
Get lost!

38:42.792 --> 38:44.375
Quick!

38:46.500 --> 38:47.958
Get out of there!

38:56.667 --> 38:57.958
Hsu Taiyu...

39:08.500 --> 39:11.250
I think...we should give up.

39:11.625 --> 39:15.167
Tao Minmin...will not be attracted by you.

39:20.292 --> 39:22.500
There is no such word like "give up".

39:23.917 --> 39:25.125
<i>(Report stray dogs to have them caught.)</i>

39:25.250 --> 39:27.042
As long as the dog is gone,

39:27.167 --> 39:28.417
they won't have excuse to meet each other.

39:30.792 --> 39:32.167
Don't do silly things.

39:34.417 --> 39:35.583
I got it!

39:43.583 --> 39:44.750
Hurry UP-

39:46.625 --> 39:49.667
Puppy...they'll think you ran away...

39:49.792 --> 39:51.042
you're not stolen.

39:51.167 --> 39:52.167
Hurry UP!

39:52.625 --> 39:54.167
Someone's coming.

40:14.375 --> 40:15.750
Such a stupid idea.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.208
Where can he go?

40:17.333 --> 40:18.667
Who's gonna take care of him?

40:21.708 --> 40:23.792
I thought you were really that cruel,

40:23.917 --> 40:24.875
that you wouldn't care if he dies.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.375
Before you can find him a new owner,

40:32.500 --> 40:33.958
he's staying with you.

40:36.583 --> 40:37.250
Why the fuck do you pee...

40:37.375 --> 40:38.583
Quick!

40:40.375 --> 40:41.625
Alright, alright.

40:45.375 --> 40:46.458
What should we call him?

40:50.625 --> 40:51.500
What about...

40:51.625 --> 40:52.625
Andy?

40:52.750 --> 40:53.458
You like it?

40:53.583 --> 40:55.083
No way.

40:55.208 --> 40:56.667
How can you humiliate my idol like this!

40:56.792 --> 40:57.833
Besides...

40:59.250 --> 41:00.250
it's a she.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.458
ND the alphabets.

41:02.583 --> 41:03.583
Anything wrong?

41:04.375 --> 41:05.833
ND...ND...

41:05.958 --> 41:07.375
See! She doesn't like it!

41:07.500 --> 41:08.167
Why not?

41:08.292 --> 41:10.125
Because you can't humiliate my idol!

41:10.250 --> 41:12.375
Besides, she's a girl! -ND!

41:12.917 --> 41:14.667
I'm gonna rub some dog pee on your head.

41:14.792 --> 41:15.583
ND... -Hsu Taiyu!

41:17.792 --> 41:20.458
(Report stray dogs to have them caught.)

41:20.583 --> 41:22.583
it seems like he's really caught...

41:24.500 --> 41:27.583
I looked for her everywhere...

41:31.500 --> 41:32.792
Maybe she's just taken back by her owner.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.250
Who's on duty today?

41:38.208 --> 41:40.250
Clean it up!

41:40.375 --> 41:41.250
You have no respect for your teacher...

41:41.375 --> 41:42.500
Stand up.

41:45.625 --> 41:46.750
No need.

41:48.708 --> 41:51.417
Who did this?

41:53.375 --> 41:56.667
Cursing others with this silly stuff!

42:04.458 --> 42:05.292
Come to my office and turn yourself in.

42:05.708 --> 42:06.667
Excuse me.

42:08.667 --> 42:10.583
You should at least take exams.

42:11.667 --> 42:14.292
You don't remember what I said?

42:14.417 --> 42:17.833
I got an anonymous letter saying you did it.

42:18.500 --> 42:19.458
You know.

42:19.792 --> 42:20.792
I remain unmarried for so many years,

42:20.917 --> 42:22.042
devoting myself to you...

42:22.167 --> 42:22.458
I mean...

42:22.583 --> 42:23.625
to the school.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.750
Can't you just do me a favor?

42:26.625 --> 42:27.542
It's 0k.

42:27.667 --> 42:29.042
Tell me the truth...

42:29.167 --> 42:30.625
I'm very understanding.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.250
Listen...

42:34.375 --> 42:36.458
If I find out that you're lying to me later,

42:36.583 --> 42:38.083
<i>I'll</i> have no choice but to punish you.

42:38.208 --> 42:39.583
I know who wrote it.

42:39.708 --> 42:40.417
Wrote what?

42:43.375 --> 42:44.458
Hsu Taiyu.

42:45.250 --> 42:46.208
You...

42:49.417 --> 42:50.417
I wrote it.

42:51.875 --> 42:53.167
Very good.

42:54.542 --> 42:55.375
Miss Lin.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.667
You can go now.

42:58.167 --> 42:59.167
Thank you.

43:03.333 --> 43:04.708
I knew it!

43:04.833 --> 43:05.625
Hsu Taiyu.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.625
I really wish it's not you again.

43:08.750 --> 43:09.458
Hsu Taiyu.

43:09.583 --> 43:11.292
How can you leave in the middle of my talk?

43:11.417 --> 43:12.083
Ms. Chen

43:12.208 --> 43:12.583
Let me punish him first.

43:12.708 --> 43:13.625
Mr. Wang, I haven't finished yet.

43:13.750 --> 43:14.417
Let me scold him first.

43:14.542 --> 43:15.708
It's not a matter of...

43:15.833 --> 43:18.375
No, I was in the middle of scolding him.

43:18.500 --> 43:19.667
One thing at one time.

43:19.792 --> 43:20.667
Don't rush.

43:21.375 --> 43:22.417
You first.

43:22.542 --> 43:23.292
OK.

43:23.417 --> 43:24.458
Hsu Taiyu.

43:24.917 --> 43:26.583
Why do you think the school still took you in

43:26.708 --> 43:28.792
even though it's your last year
in high school?

43:29.292 --> 43:32.333
Because you were in science honors class.

43:32.458 --> 43:34.833
Even attended
Science Olympiad competition.

43:34.958 --> 43:36.625
What happened to you?

43:39.417 --> 43:40.833
Have you heard of
"The Tortoise and the Hare"?

43:40.958 --> 43:43.375
And "Eradicating the Three Scourges"

43:43.750 --> 43:45.250
Do you know who's "Zhou Chu"?

43:45.792 --> 43:46.667
Yeah.

43:46.792 --> 43:49.875
It's pronounced "Chu" not "Choo"...

43:57.375 --> 43:58.542
Thank you.

43:58.667 --> 44:00.042
You...

44:00.167 --> 44:02.292
really didn't have to do that.

44:03.250 --> 44:04.708
That's what a friend is for.

44:04.833 --> 44:05.792
It does me no harm anyway.

44:12.292 --> 44:13.833
One chain letter to me...

44:13.958 --> 44:15.500
One to "Asshole"...

44:15.625 --> 44:17.208
Two others taken away by me...

44:17.667 --> 44:19.208
Who got the last one?

44:23.833 --> 44:25.500
Tao Minmin...

44:26.667 --> 44:28.292
I really regret for it.

44:28.875 --> 44:29.750
That's why...

44:29.875 --> 44:31.917
You should work hard to get her!

44:32.792 --> 44:34.667
Girls like her must have had

44:34.792 --> 44:36.292
enough of compliments.

44:36.583 --> 44:38.042
Why not write bad things about her

44:38.167 --> 44:39.333
to get her attention?

44:39.583 --> 44:40.792
For example...

44:41.292 --> 44:42.167
Thick waist...

44:42.458 --> 44:43.375
Huge butt...

44:43.583 --> 44:45.167
So fake when she talks...

44:46.208 --> 44:47.042
You sure?

44:47.167 --> 44:47.875
Yeah.

44:48.667 --> 44:50.250
And conclude it with...

44:50.583 --> 44:51.750
But still...

44:52.250 --> 44:53.583
I like you a lot.

45:12.583 --> 45:13.375
Hey.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.500
Don't quote lyrics if you have no good idea.

45:15.625 --> 45:17.750
You can quote foreign poets' work.

45:19.167 --> 45:19.750
Who's gonna understand it?

45:19.875 --> 45:23.208
That's why it'll make you look mysterious.

45:23.333 --> 45:24.292
You sure?

45:24.792 --> 45:25.917
Sure.

45:26.333 --> 45:27.458
Let me tell you.

45:27.583 --> 45:30.167
Girls are so difficult to understand.

45:30.292 --> 45:32.583
When we say nothing's wrong...

45:32.708 --> 45:33.958
it means something's wrong.

45:34.458 --> 45:37.042
When we say it's 0k,

45:37.167 --> 45:38.333
it means it's not 0k.

45:39.167 --> 45:40.458
If we say...

45:40.583 --> 45:42.167
lam fat...

45:42.583 --> 45:44.708
That means we hope you can tell us...

45:44.833 --> 45:46.583
You're not fat at all.

45:48.708 --> 45:49.458
That's the way...

45:49.583 --> 45:50.708
Tao Minmin thinks.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.833

46:03.958 --> 46:04.875

Ouyang Extraordinary...

46:30.792 --> 46:32.042
You actually...

46:32.167 --> 46:33.542
know Hsu Taiyu quite well.

46:33.667 --> 46:34.542
Right?

46:46.167 --> 46:46.583
What?

46:46.708 --> 46:48.625
Did you watch the Bulls vs. Lakers game?

46:48.750 --> 46:49.917
Of course.

46:50.417 --> 46:51.708
Shit, what a dramatic victory.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.583
Jordan is God!

46:55.375 --> 46:56.792
So dramatic!

46:59.708 --> 47:01.375
One-on-one if you dare.

47:02.458 --> 47:03.583
3 minutes.

Hsu Taiyu, don't go further.

47:56.333 --> 47:57.958
Ma Suyuan.

47:58.333 --> 47:58.958
Hsu Taiyu

47:59.875 --> 48:03.125
Taiyu thought the accident wouldn't have

48:03.250 --> 48:03.750
A-yuan.

48:04.292 --> 48:07.375
Happened, if he didn't take the challenge.

48:10.750 --> 48:12.167
That was the last time

48:12.542 --> 48:14.333
I saw Hsu Taiyu,

48:15.250 --> 48:16.792
before he transferred to First High.

48:17.583 --> 48:20.958
He became someone I don't know.

48:50.333 --> 48:51.458
Why don't we meet at Ice Palace,

48:51.583 --> 48:52.583
but here?

48:53.542 --> 48:54.750
You feel embarrassed?

48:56.208 --> 48:57.333
Hsu Taiyu.

48:57.792 --> 48:58.917
Let's have a race.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.250
The winner can make a request.

49:01.375 --> 49:02.833
Whoever crosses that line first wins.

49:50.583 --> 49:51.792
You can never beat me.

49:57.708 --> 49:59.542
Stop or you'll kill yourself.

50:24.167 --> 50:25.458
What's wrong with you?

50:33.333 --> 50:35.333
When you saw me in the pool the other day,

50:36.333 --> 50:38.667
were you afraid that I'd die like Su-yuan,

50:38.792 --> 50:40.208
in front of your eyes.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.167
Ouyang told me everything.

50:46.667 --> 50:47.625
None of your business.

50:50.958 --> 50:52.750
Who are you to shout at me?

50:52.875 --> 50:55.042
Who are you to hurt yourself like this?

50:55.167 --> 50:56.792
It's also not easy for Ouyang, ok?

50:56.917 --> 50:57.833
Ma Suyuan must be pissed off

50:57.958 --> 50:59.667
to see the way you are now.

50:59.792 --> 51:01.375
Don't make me beat you!

51:10.458 --> 51:11.583
Hsu Taiyu.

51:27.583 --> 51:28.750
Hsu Taiyu.

51:29.583 --> 51:30.958
If I could do it over again,

51:31.708 --> 51:33.625
I'd still have a race with you.

51:35.375 --> 51:36.458
If A-yuan could do it over again,

51:36.583 --> 51:38.208
he'd still go into the sea.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.167
But it's our own decision.

51:41.292 --> 51:42.875
Not your responsibility.

52:16.708 --> 52:17.625
Hsu Taiyu.

52:17.750 --> 52:19.333
You agreed that

52:21.167 --> 52:24.167
the winner can make a request.

52:28.500 --> 52:29.458
What do you want?

52:33.375 --> 52:34.750
Can you...

52:35.708 --> 52:37.167
be that Hsu Taiyu again?

53:53.500 --> 53:54.333
Stand up!

54:05.792 --> 54:06.708
A...attention.

54:07.792 --> 54:10.583
Good morning, sir.

54:14.458 --> 54:15.667
Shut up!

54:19.917 --> 54:21.500
Hsu Taiyu.

54:21.958 --> 54:22.792
Do you...

54:24.375 --> 54:25.583
have any question?

54:25.917 --> 54:26.917
Yes.

54:28.500 --> 54:29.417
Which page are we at today?

54:36.208 --> 54:39.833
Chapter 7 on page 125.

54:40.833 --> 54:42.667
World War 2.

54:44.875 --> 54:46.167
Hsu...

54:46.750 --> 54:48.542
You have

54:50.375 --> 54:51.708
geography textbook in your hand.

54:58.333 --> 54:59.083
Chapter 7.

54:59.208 --> 55:00.333
Page 125.

55:00.458 --> 55:01.583
Take your textbook out!

55:09.167 --> 55:09.750
Those who don't have it...

55:09.875 --> 55:11.375
go and sit next to those who do.

55:51.958 --> 55:53.250
Am I cute?

56:20.958 --> 56:22.167
WOW!

56:23.583 --> 56:24.333
Miss.

56:24.458 --> 56:25.708
You look familiar...

56:27.833 --> 56:29.625
You are my high school...

56:29.750 --> 56:30.792
teacher.

56:32.625 --> 56:33.750
What's wrong with you today?

56:33.875 --> 56:34.917
Going to temple festival?

56:35.625 --> 56:36.292
Not really.

56:36.417 --> 56:37.417
L---

56:39.583 --> 56:40.583
Hurry UP!

56:40.708 --> 56:42.625
We need to secure our seats at McDonald's!

56:42.750 --> 56:43.917
Temple festival is this way...

57:03.583 --> 57:04.500
Look at that guy...

57:04.625 --> 57:06.250
So cute... -Look, it's him...

57:06.375 --> 57:06.958
so tall.

57:07.250 --> 57:08.167
So cute...

57:24.500 --> 57:25.583
You idiot.

57:25.833 --> 57:27.333
Look where you're going.

57:38.042 --> 57:39.375
You got a hole in your brain?

57:39.500 --> 57:40.417
It's fine.

57:40.833 --> 57:41.792
Let's look for a seat first

57:41.917 --> 57:43.042
and order later.

57:43.167 --> 57:43.917
You're gonna help me.

57:44.042 --> 57:44.458
OK.

57:44.500 --> 57:45.542
Here's what you ordered.

57:45.667 --> 57:45.833
Thanks.

57:45.958 --> 57:46.875
Have a nice meal.

57:47.292 --> 57:48.125
Hello! Welcome!

57:48.250 --> 57:49.125
What would you like to order?

57:51.375 --> 57:52.583
Hsu Taiyu.

57:53.542 --> 57:55.083
He's studying there.

57:55.208 --> 57:57.708
It seems like he really changed.

57:59.375 --> 58:00.458
Maybe he's here...

58:00.583 --> 58:03.292
because you come here often.

58:05.208 --> 58:06.792
Let's go... -what?

58:07.583 --> 58:09.042
Hey, she wants to talk to you.

58:09.167 --> 58:10.583
<i>I'll</i> find us a table.

58:12.333 --> 58:13.250
That seat is...

58:13.375 --> 58:14.417
Hsu...

58:15.417 --> 58:17.500
I heard you were in science honors class...

58:18.292 --> 58:19.667
If that's the case,

58:19.792 --> 58:21.542
you should never give up.

58:22.250 --> 58:23.667
If there's something you don't understand,

58:23.792 --> 58:24.833
I can help you with it.

58:26.167 --> 58:26.667
Thanks.

58:27.792 --> 58:29.625
You asked me to give you my personal info.

58:29.750 --> 58:30.750
You'll have it.

58:31.583 --> 58:32.792
But...

58:33.875 --> 58:35.958
Don't mistake "Disney" for "Destiny" again.

58:40.208 --> 58:41.500
Why "Destiny"?

58:42.417 --> 58:43.708
Disney is my pseudonym.

58:51.958 --> 58:54.792
What...were you...talking about?

58:56.208 --> 58:58.458
Nothing. They wanted to share the table.

59:00.833 --> 59:01.917
Study.

59:12.917 --> 59:15.167
<i>Hsu Taiyu started to study hard.</i>

59:15.792 --> 59:16.875
<i>Very hard.</i>

59:17.750 --> 59:20.958
<i>Although I think it's because I woke him up,</i>

59:22.250 --> 59:23.500
<i>the truth is...</i>

59:23.958 --> 59:25.458
<i>he did it for Minmin.</i>

59:25.667 --> 59:26.625
<i>He wants to get into top 10</i>

59:26.750 --> 59:28.667
<i>in the coming mock exam.</i>

59:29.792 --> 59:30.917
Hsu Taiyu.

59:31.708 --> 59:34.167
Did he come to see you?

59:37.625 --> 59:39.208
Back then...

59:39.583 --> 59:40.083
if a girl

59:40.208 --> 59:42.292
was willing to give you her personal info,

59:42.583 --> 59:43.458
that means...

59:43.583 --> 59:46.208
she didn't dislike you at all.

59:46.333 --> 59:49.250
<i>(The person I like:)</i>

59:53.750 --> 59:56.208
Latest version of sample exams, good luck.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.083
Thank you.

59:57.208 --> 59:58.917
Thank you.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:05.625
Ah.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.167
It's my hubby.

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:11.750
When I grow up.

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.750
I will go to Taipei for your concert...

01:00:15.292 --> 01:00:16.708
A piece of cake.

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:18.917
One day <i>I'll</i> ask Andy Lau

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:20.375
to sing for you.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:22.833
Really?

01:00:23.417 --> 01:00:24.333
Yeah right.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:25.625
Hey! Don't touch it!

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:27.208
Let's go.

01:00:32.417 --> 01:00:33.167
Let's go.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.333
If we add the two together...

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:41.417
Idiot.

01:00:41.833 --> 01:00:46.375
Sin"2(x) + cos"2(X) = 1

01:00:46.917 --> 01:00:48.667
No exception.

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:50.333
What?

01:00:57.417 --> 01:00:58.583
Look behind you.

01:00:59.792 --> 01:01:03.167
Wow...when did Truly become so serious?

01:01:03.792 --> 01:01:05.750
Something's wrong with Boss...hehe.

01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:23.250
I live just down there.

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:25.083
It's quite late.

01:01:25.208 --> 01:01:26.500
You should go home now.

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.167
Oh...

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:30.292
it's 0k.

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:31.542
If I linger a bit,

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:32.958
I might run into Tao Minmin.

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:36.792
Oh...

01:01:39.208 --> 01:01:40.167
By the way.

01:01:40.417 --> 01:01:43.375
ND already learned to pee at the same spot.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.708
Thank God...

01:01:46.167 --> 01:01:47.750
she didn't grow into an idiot like you.

01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:07.667
For me?

01:02:10.792 --> 01:02:12.458
I planned to give it to Tao Minmin.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:15.250
But it's so ugly and it's Andy Lau...

01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:17.375
better give it to you.

01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:25.667
Hey. . -

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.208
tell me, for guys...

01:02:27.708 --> 01:02:31.333
what's the definition of pretty girls?

01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:35.417
You mean what kind of girls Ouyang likes?

01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:38.750
Whatever.

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:40.167
Anything.

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:44.375
He was crazy about Vivian Chow before.

01:02:46.542 --> 01:02:47.792
What about you?

01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:52.167
Uchida Yuki is not bad.

01:02:52.417 --> 01:02:53.417
Sakai Noriko also.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.792
Both Japanese?

01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:57.333
Yes.

01:03:01.458 --> 01:03:03.542
I want to learn roller skating.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:05.625
Why so sudden?

01:03:06.417 --> 01:03:07.667
Because...

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:10.708
Ouyang says he likes roller skating.

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:14.250
You're pretty good...can you teach me?

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:16.667
Sure.

01:03:31.167 --> 01:03:32.167
I want this.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.792
Hello, Mr. Tang.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:56.250
Should I ask my bro to come down?

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:10.583
Where can I get the same look as yours?

01:04:13.667 --> 01:04:15.542
Go to hell and get reborn will be easier.

01:04:19.583 --> 01:04:21.708
Lin Truly, are you hitting puberty?

01:04:21.833 --> 01:04:23.375
Don't be so mean.

01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:26.583
It's normal for girls to care their looks.

01:04:27.667 --> 01:04:28.792
Let me help you.

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:31.958
Thank you sis.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.583
Are you alright?

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:39.417
Yeah, sprained my ankle, that's all.

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:41.417
Just need to ice it a bit.

01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:46.167
Ouyang got injured. Does Truly know?

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:47.125
I don't know...

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.583
Let's tell her when she's here.

01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:52.167
Hey hey.

01:04:52.542 --> 01:04:55.292
Are you close friends of Ouyang's?

01:04:58.167 --> 01:04:59.083
Ouyang!

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:00.792
Chiayi, you... -Calm down.

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:02.917
Are you alright?

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:04.708
Yeah.

01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.750
Wow it swells so much.

01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:01.250
No way, we must heat it.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.083
Ice it.

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:06.500
Heat it! Were you there in health class?

01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:18.333
Hey...

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:21.083
I always ice with this when I'm injured.

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:22.500
Convenient and tasty.

01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:26.250
Thanks.

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:27.958
Guess I don't have to visit health center.

01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:32.167
<i>I'll</i> go back to class now.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:41.792
You look cute today.

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:43.500
The hairstyle suits you.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.375
Good luck with your exam.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:49.667
WOW!

01:06:49.792 --> 01:06:51.208
So cute.

01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:53.917
Lin Truly, you are so pretty.

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:56.042
I want to look like you!

01:06:56.167 --> 01:06:57.625
He said you're cute!

01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:59.625
Did you put on makeup?

01:07:08.375 --> 01:07:10.333
<i>Hsu Taiyu got 10th place in the mock exam</i>

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.833
<i>among all 3rd year students.</i>

01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:15.125
<i>While the whole school was still in shock,</i>

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.958
<i>the new director arrived.</i>

01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:21.625
Littering.

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:24.542
Which eye of yours saw that I littered?

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:26.208
You are the litter.

01:07:26.667 --> 01:07:28.208
Director Chuan said...

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:30.083
Everyone in class 317...

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:31.792
is a piece of shit.

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:35.500
Fuck! What the hell!

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:39.375
School regulation says "no hair coloring".

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.333
The new director hates people
who break the rules.

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:46.417
Excuse me.

01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.375
Hsu Taiyu from class 317.

01:08:05.792 --> 01:08:07.500
Finally.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:11.208
You'd better be good until you graduate.

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:13.667
Otherwise <i>I'll</i> kick you out of the school

01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:16.042
once you're cited with 3 serious demerits.

01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:17.292
As you wish.

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:23.375
<i>I'll</i> do my best.

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.750
Because people like you

01:08:27.582 --> 01:08:30.582
do not deserve education at all.

01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:55.957
Stand up.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:03.207
Who got first place in the exam this time?

01:09:03.332 --> 01:09:04.167
Please stand up.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.167
Let's give him a big hand.

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:23.667
Good job.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.792
So good that I have to ask Hsu...

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:29.625
how did you cheat in the exam?

01:09:31.957 --> 01:09:33.875
I asked people to give you a big hand

01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:36.875
to see if you know what is shame!

01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:42.625
You just talked, stand up!

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:46.250
Sir.

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:47.042
I didn't talk.

01:09:47.167 --> 01:09:49.250
I have eyes to judge that.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:52.250
Did you help him...

01:09:53.207 --> 01:09:55.458
in the exam?

01:09:58.292 --> 01:10:00.417
Can someone come forward and testify that

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:02.208
Hsu Taiyu cheated.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:07.208
No one wants to tell the truth, huh?

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:09.833
Now...

01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:12.833
All of you, go to the running track.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:13.750
Stand up!

01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:16.292
I know you dislike me...

01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:17.583
but it has nothing to do with them!

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:18.667
Leave them alone.

01:10:18.792 --> 01:10:19.542
Fine.

01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:21.583
Want to play the hero?

01:10:23.542 --> 01:10:25.667
<i>I'll</i> leave all 5O rounds to you.

01:10:25.792 --> 01:10:27.167
Run to your heart's content.

01:10:41.583 --> 01:10:43.583
Director Chuan must be sick. So strict.

01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:46.375
Demerit for skirts above the knees.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.167
A lap is 400 meters!

01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:51.250
I heard that Hsu already finished 35 rounds.

01:11:00.167 --> 01:11:01.500
I heard that he cheated in the exam

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:02.708
and started a battle with the director.

01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:04.417
He's punished to run 5O rounds.

01:11:04.542 --> 01:11:05.917
He's not that kind of person.

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:08.417
Minmin, Chiayi is bullshiting.

01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:10.458
Lin Truly...

01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:12.833
Hsu Taiyu.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.792
Why don't you tell the truth?

01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:18.208
Hsu Taiyu!

01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:27.833
Excuse me.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500
Director.

01:11:29.625 --> 01:11:31.458
Hsu Taiyu really didn't cheat.

01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:32.625
I can testify for him.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.083
He really studied very hard.

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:37.250
You should stay away from people like him.

01:11:38.375 --> 01:11:39.333
Tell him,

01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:41.833
if he can't finish, 1 more demerit for him.

01:11:41.958 --> 01:11:43.750
Plus one-week suspension from school.

01:11:44.417 --> 01:11:45.833
Let him reflect on himself at home.

01:12:10.917 --> 01:12:12.792
How's your boss doing?

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:14.542
Dunno...

01:12:14.958 --> 01:12:16.833
He doesn't answer on his pager.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.500
I heard that the school festival next week

01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:21.458
might be cancelled by the director.

01:12:21.792 --> 01:12:24.667
He said we students don't study enough.

01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:26.583
What the fuck is he thinking!

01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:28.417
Students also deserve human rights!

01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:30.667
The authority shouldn't let him bully us!

01:12:33.292 --> 01:12:34.583
Of course not!

01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.375
We'll let the authority hear our voice

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.583
at the school festival next week.

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:44.167
Let him know he can't do whatever he likes.

01:12:44.292 --> 01:12:45.250
Let's do it!

01:13:05.167 --> 01:13:06.417
Sorry.

01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:11.500
Please stand up for our rights -Please.

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.750
Please, the revolt needs your support.

01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:15.708
The revolt needs your support.

01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:17.833
Please have a look...

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:20.583
Please, please have a look.

01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:21.667
Please support First High's revolt.

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:23.542
Please support First High's revolt.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:26.292
Please, please have a look.

01:13:27.542 --> 01:13:28.542
We really really

01:13:28.667 --> 01:13:30.583
need your support.

01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:34.792
Don't take it.

01:13:34.917 --> 01:13:37.375
You're done if the director knows.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:46.792
Leave it to me.

01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:52.542
Hand it out over there. You, there.

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.042
You're openly instigating others to revolt,

01:14:11.167 --> 01:14:12.458
violating the regulations,

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:13.458
humiliating your teachers.

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:16.958
Everyone who helped you
now has a demerit.

01:14:17.542 --> 01:14:19.542
Do your parents know what you're doing?

01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:21.458
You brought disgrace on your parents.

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:23.500
You brought shame on them.

01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.833
The teacher said Hsu is a gangster.

01:14:27.958 --> 01:14:30.917
He's not even allowed to go to school!

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.042
You completely destroyed my reputation.

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:34.833
You...go upstairs and write your confession.

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:36.292
You're grounded for two days.

01:14:36.417 --> 01:14:37.625
NOW!

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:43.458
How embarrassing.

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.792
I was scolded by the teacher on the phone.

01:14:45.917 --> 01:14:46.875
L---

01:14:47.708 --> 01:14:49.250
Hello? -This is Truly's cram school.

01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:50.875
Lin Truly is busy now.

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:53.333
Hey...

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.167
it's a gush--

01:14:56.667 --> 01:14:57.625
Hello?

01:14:57.958 --> 01:14:59.083
IFS you again!

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.792
Never call again!

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.667
You are so rude.

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:08.833
If he calls again, let me pick it up.

01:15:08.958 --> 01:15:10.167
Must be him.

01:15:10.292 --> 01:15:11.583
Pretending to be cram school staff.

01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:17.667
Lin Truly.

01:15:18.542 --> 01:15:20.417
Don't call me these two days.

01:15:20.542 --> 01:15:21.417
What's wrong?

01:15:21.542 --> 01:15:22.333
What happened?

01:15:22.458 --> 01:15:24.417
Nothing's wrong. Bye.

01:15:59.958 --> 01:16:01.333
Are you ok?

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:05.583
It's so late...you must be going to bed?

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.208
I'm just stopping by.

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:26.375
Well...

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.625
I'm leaving then.

01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:31.583
Hold on.

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:39.708
ND.

01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:45.792
ND.

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.167
Are you alright?

01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:59.042
Never knew I can be suspended
from school.

01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:00.250
Feels awesome.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.375
I mean...you passed out at school...

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:07.625
it's just heat stroke.

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:08.792
Nothing fatal.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.375
Why are you suddenly grounded?

01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:26.375
Anyone can be grounded for knowing you,
ok?

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:32.583
What brought you here?

01:17:32.958 --> 01:17:33.917
Because you said...

01:17:35.542 --> 01:17:38.167
When a girl says "I'm 0k", she's not ok.

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:40.875
Nothing's wrong means something's wrong.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.583
Do you want to come to a place with me?

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:50.583
What?

01:17:58.375 --> 01:17:59.875
Wait here.

01:18:25.542 --> 01:18:27.042
Since I discovered this place,

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:28.917
I've been coming here at midnight a lot.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.250
You want to learn roller skating, right?

01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:45.500
Let me tell you how not to fall.

01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:47.542
What's the tip?

01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:49.458
Don't...

01:18:49.583 --> 01:18:51.250
be afraid of falling.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:09.417
It can't get worse than falling.

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:11.417
The important thing is...

01:19:11.542 --> 01:19:12.833
why are you here.

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:24.792
Thank you.

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:26.708
What?

01:20:09.375 --> 01:20:10.625
On the day of school festival,

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:12.667
let's give out awards to the top 1O students

01:20:12.792 --> 01:20:15.792

Class 306, Li Chengfu.

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:51.583
It's coming...

01:20:51.708 --> 01:20:52.625
9th place.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:55.375
Class 303, Wang Aiwei.

01:20:57.792 --> 01:20:58.875
Get ready. Get ready.

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:04.500
Up to the stage, now!

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:06.583
Please come up to the stage.

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:11.667
You might be wondering...

01:21:11.792 --> 01:21:13.458
why there are only 9 of them.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.583
Because...

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.542
the school denounces cheating in exams.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.208
We human beings
must have a sense of shame.

01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:25.542
You should never think those sneaky,

01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:27.042
shameful behavior of yours

01:21:27.167 --> 01:21:28.667
will not be found out.

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:33.292
Hsu of Class 317, I'm talking about YOU.

01:21:34.375 --> 01:21:35.167
What rubbish?

01:21:36.583 --> 01:21:37.792
Mind ur own business!

01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:54.750
Sir.

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:12.083
We're giving out awards now,

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:14.458
if you want to talk, we'll...

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:15.417
Director.

01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:19.167
I have something serious to report now.

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.667
My skirt is 3cm higher than my knee.

01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:24.417
My socks are not 100% white.

01:22:24.542 --> 01:22:27.292
My jacket's zipper never pulled high enough.

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:28.042
Please punish me, sir.

01:22:28.167 --> 01:22:29.750
All these are not important now.

01:22:31.917 --> 01:22:34.250
We'll take our time to punish her later.

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:36.750
If none of these rules is important,

01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:38.583
why should we follow them?

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:40.833
Therefore,

01:22:41.292 --> 01:22:42.708
please cite me with an admonition

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:44.958
according to school regulations.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.583
Director.

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:05.250
I cheated in exams.

01:23:08.542 --> 01:23:11.667
Please cite me with a major demerit

01:23:11.792 --> 01:23:13.250
according to school regulations.

01:23:13.375 --> 01:23:14.375
Ouyaflg-

01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:16.750
Don't play with your future.

01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:18.833
You're applying for Taiwan University,

01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:20.333
Your discipline record can't be affected.

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:21.583
Besides, we know very well. You're smart.

01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:22.667
It's not possible that you...

01:23:22.792 --> 01:23:24.375
Why not?

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.583
If Director Chuan can say that Hsu Taiyu

01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:28.458
of Class 317 cheated on the exam,

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:29.583
I can say I did it.

01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:31.167
And what I say counts.

01:23:31.542 --> 01:23:32.583
Alright.

01:23:33.917 --> 01:23:36.792
Since Ouyang confessed his crime bravely,

01:23:36.917 --> 01:23:39.500
<i>I'll</i> make sure he gets a major demerit.

01:23:42.583 --> 01:23:43.375
Director Chuan...

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.083
We need further discussion.

01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:46.083
Principal, Ouyang just...

01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:47.625
Director.

01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:50.250
I'm in shorts while it's not a P.E. class.

01:23:50.375 --> 01:23:51.792
Please cite me with an admonition.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.792
Director.

01:23:56.667 --> 01:23:58.667
You're my chocolate.

01:23:59.708 --> 01:24:01.417
I'm disrespectful to teachers.

01:24:01.542 --> 01:24:02.875
Please cite me with an admonition.

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:07.375
Director.

01:24:07.833 --> 01:24:09.542
I spread obscene ideas.

01:24:09.667 --> 01:24:11.583
Please cite me with a minor demerit.

01:24:15.167 --> 01:24:16.458
Director.

01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:18.375
Eat shit!

01:24:23.583 --> 01:24:26.125
Sorry I humiliated teachers.

01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:28.167
Please cite me with a major demerit.

01:24:30.792 --> 01:24:31.667
Director.

01:24:31.792 --> 01:24:33.375
L...l have a girlfriend.

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:35.583
Bullshit.

01:24:37.375 --> 01:24:38.500
Director.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:41.875
I brought my pager to school.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:44.667
Please cite me with an admonition.

01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:47.417
Director.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:49.375
I didn't flush the toilet.

01:24:49.917 --> 01:24:50.750
Director.

01:24:51.375 --> 01:24:52.625
I'm not wearing underpants.

01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:54.458
I play Game Boy in class.

01:24:54.583 --> 01:24:55.583
I sleep in class...

01:24:55.708 --> 01:24:57.458
I have a boyfriend...

01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:19.375
Director.

01:25:20.375 --> 01:25:22.375
You said students should be like students.

01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:24.583
But neither exams nor school regulations

01:25:24.708 --> 01:25:26.375
can define us.

01:25:26.625 --> 01:25:29.417
Those with good scores can make mistakes.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:32.542
Those who made a mistake can improve.

01:25:32.792 --> 01:25:35.500
Whether we're good or bad is not up to you.

01:25:35.917 --> 01:25:37.667
Only we know who we are.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.792
Only we can decide the way we are.

01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:50.958
Alright. Alright.

01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:52.833
Calm down everyone.

01:25:53.375 --> 01:25:57.750
Today is the 54th anniversary of our school.

01:25:58.333 --> 01:26:02.375
First High is always a liberal school.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.833
I'm here to promise you that, we'll discuss,

01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:08.792
improve ourselves and proceed accordingly.

01:26:17.167 --> 01:26:21.167
The long-waited water balloon fight

01:26:21.292 --> 01:26:23.625
officially starts now.

01:26:41.375 --> 01:26:43.917
<i>We didn't know until years later...</i>

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.875
<i>the first person you throw your balloon at,</i>

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.958
<i>is not someone you dislike,</i>

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:53.583
<i>but someone you can't take your eyes off.</i>

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.833
Hey! You meant it.

01:27:45.958 --> 01:27:46.750
That's not true.

01:27:46.875 --> 01:27:49.375
Just to wait for Dahe and Small.

01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:53.792
Are you tired?

01:28:07.292 --> 01:28:08.833
Just to keep your hands warm.

01:28:20.542 --> 01:28:22.417
I picked your key.

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:24.250
We must be meant for each other, right?

01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:25.542
Meant for hell.

01:28:27.917 --> 01:28:28.792
You're going so slow on purpose...

01:28:28.917 --> 01:28:31.292
is it because you want us to be alone?

01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:34.833
Boss...

01:28:34.958 --> 01:28:36.833
Sakuraki...wait for me!

01:29:01.958 --> 01:29:03.417
Follow the beat!

01:29:05.833 --> 01:29:08.750
Truth or Dare.

01:29:14.333 --> 01:29:15.625
Ouyang...

01:29:17.167 --> 01:29:18.292
Are you seeing someone?

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.792
Is she here?

01:29:23.583 --> 01:29:24.667
Yes, she's here.

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:28.292
Wow! Mr. Straight-A confessed his love.

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:35.292
Boss, boss.

01:29:35.417 --> 01:29:37.500
So...are you seeing someone? Is she here?

01:29:37.625 --> 01:29:38.667
Is she here?

01:29:38.792 --> 01:29:40.458
Yes, she's here.

01:29:44.583 --> 01:29:45.125
Who's that?

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:46.458
Boss, tell me...please.

01:29:46.583 --> 01:29:47.500
Hurry up...

01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:51.542
Oh...Lin Truly.

01:29:52.917 --> 01:29:54.375
Are you seeing someone?

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.792
Is he here?

01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:15.500
Hold on.

01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:17.417
Is this bottle...

01:30:17.542 --> 01:30:19.375
pointing closer to Tao Minmin?

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.167
Boss.

01:30:20.292 --> 01:30:21.250
Ask again. Ask again.

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:22.042
Tao Minmin.

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:23.792
Ask again. Ask again.

01:30:23.917 --> 01:30:27.583
Minmin, Minmin.

01:30:27.708 --> 01:30:29.333
Have you ever sent out chain letters?

01:30:35.917 --> 01:30:37.458
What the hell is that?

01:30:37.583 --> 01:30:39.375
Drink it.

01:30:41.333 --> 01:30:42.542
How did you know that Minmin sent me

01:30:42.667 --> 01:30:46.333
the chain letter and reported me?

01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:50.250
Who knows that
you're sending chain letters?

01:30:50.875 --> 01:30:52.792
Must be the person who sent it to you.

01:30:54.708 --> 01:30:58.333
Tao Minmin received exactly the same letter

01:30:58.583 --> 01:31:00.333
she sent out. That's why she knows

01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:02.792
one of the classmates who received

01:31:02.917 --> 01:31:04.667
her letter sent it to the teacher.

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.417
I guess you're the only one who knows

01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.958
Wang Baidan among the 5 receivers.

01:31:17.333 --> 01:31:18.208
I never thought

01:31:18.333 --> 01:31:20.125
she would do something like this.

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:22.792
I thought she was perfect.

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:26.542
Now I think your personality is better.

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.583
And if I look closely...

01:31:30.708 --> 01:31:32.500
she's not that much prettier than you.

01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:36.833
Maybe just this much prettier.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.917
Which university do you want to go to?

01:32:06.625 --> 01:32:07.875
Taiwan University, I guess.

01:32:08.417 --> 01:32:09.583
And you?

01:32:10.833 --> 01:32:12.750
Same for me.

01:32:14.917 --> 01:32:17.583
But...l don't think I can get in.

01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:23.167
Hsu Taiyu.

01:32:25.167 --> 01:32:26.250
If...

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.833
we end up going to different universities,

01:32:29.542 --> 01:32:31.375
can you promise me?

01:32:34.792 --> 01:32:36.125
That"

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:39.792
you'll continue to study hard and graduate.

01:32:41.375 --> 01:32:42.667
That you'll never fight again...

01:32:44.958 --> 01:32:46.292
That you'll never...

01:32:46.417 --> 01:32:48.500
worry people who care about you.

01:32:57.333 --> 01:32:57.958
<i>OK.</i>

01:32:58.583 --> 01:32:59.917
I promise you.

01:33:04.583 --> 01:33:05.750
What about you?

01:33:05.958 --> 01:33:06.958
Yes?

01:33:11.375 --> 01:33:17.792
If I go to somewhere very far from you,

01:33:18.667 --> 01:33:20.208
can you promise me?

01:33:28.292 --> 01:33:30.458
That sesame dressing and noodles

01:33:30.583 --> 01:33:31.792
will never be mixed together.

01:33:33.167 --> 01:33:34.333
Not funny.

01:33:35.542 --> 01:33:37.167
I'm serious.

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:43.625
Hsu Taiyu.

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:44.917
Shooting star!

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:46.542
Make a wish.

01:33:57.542 --> 01:34:00.750
<i>Chain letters can never bring good luck.</i>

01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:03.417
<i>But on that night,</i>

01:34:04.333 --> 01:34:05.708
<i>I felt...</i>

01:34:06.292 --> 01:34:08.167
<i>I found my luck.</i>

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:33.375
<i>Welcome to the</i>

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.125
<i>"Superstitious Show".</i>

01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:37.333
Mom! it's starting!

01:34:37.958 --> 01:34:39.625
<i>Let's have a look at this weird picture.</i>

01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:41.708
<i>A group of high school students went</i>

01:34:41.833 --> 01:34:43.333
<i>camping last month and took this photo.</i>

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.500
<i>Let's hear what the expert has to say.</i>

01:34:45.625 --> 01:34:47.750
<i>The student in the photo</i>

01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:51.167
<i>became translucent.</i>

01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:55.667
<i>If we look at the supernatural aspect of it,</i>

01:34:55.792 --> 01:34:58.417
<i>it's obvious that</i>

01:34:58.792 --> 01:35:00.208
<i>this photo</i>

01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:02.875
<i>is full of supernatural energy.</i>

01:35:04.292 --> 01:35:06.250
<i>I suggest the student</i>

01:35:06.375 --> 01:35:09.625
<i>visit temples guarding land and underworld</i>

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:11.250
to <i>remove ill fortune. -Go home</i> soon.

01:35:11.375 --> 01:35:12.667
Take care.

01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:14.458
Thanks.

01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:32.375
Hsu Taiyu.

01:35:33.167 --> 01:35:34.292
I finally...

01:35:34.708 --> 01:35:36.333
90'! you.

01:35:44.583 --> 01:35:45.750
The bell has rung.

01:35:45.875 --> 01:35:47.167
Hand in your paper.

01:35:56.375 --> 01:35:57.625
Sakuraki said that

01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:00.250
Hsu hasn't come to school for a week.

01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:02.375
He's even absent from the mock exam.

01:36:02.833 --> 01:36:05.417
Did you watch the TV show last week?

01:36:05.542 --> 01:36:07.792
Maybe something really happened to him?

01:36:07.917 --> 01:36:09.458
I don't think so.

01:36:47.917 --> 01:36:49.167
Hsu Taiyu.

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:56.417
Why didn't you take the mock exam?

01:36:56.542 --> 01:36:57.792
None of your business.

01:37:00.208 --> 01:37:02.375
Why did you...fight again?

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:03.667
For no reason.

01:37:05.292 --> 01:37:06.333
They wanted to fight.

01:37:06.625 --> 01:37:07.875
So I fought with them.

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:15.792
Hsu Taiyu.

01:37:17.792 --> 01:37:19.625
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

01:37:29.208 --> 01:37:30.750
<i>When a girl says</i>

01:37:30.875 --> 01:37:33.333
<i>"nothing's wrong",
something must be wrong.</i>

01:37:33.458 --> 01:37:35.958
<i>"I'm ok" means "I'm not ok."</i>

01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:38.042
<i>We didn't know until</i>

01:37:38.167 --> 01:37:39.542
<i>long after that:</i>

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:42.083
<i>when a girl says</i>

01:37:42.208 --> 01:37:43.750
<i>"I don't want to talk to you anymore."</i>

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.917
<i>She doesn't really hate you.</i>

01:37:46.625 --> 01:37:48.583
<i>Instead she cares about you...</i>

01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:50.750
<i>v6 TY</i>

01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:52.792
<i>very much.</i>

01:38:29.875 --> 01:38:31.375
Happy birthday!

01:38:35.375 --> 01:38:36.583
Thank you...

01:38:37.417 --> 01:38:38.583
This is...

01:38:39.167 --> 01:38:40.667
Boss brought it back himself.

01:38:41.167 --> 01:38:42.708
We don't know what he's been busy with,

01:38:43.375 --> 01:38:45.583
but he still remembers your birthday.

01:38:45.917 --> 01:38:47.375
And this!

01:38:47.792 --> 01:38:49.208
Boss said that you shouldn't listen to it

01:38:49.333 --> 01:38:51.208
before the university entrance exam.

01:38:52.208 --> 01:38:53.667
There must be something special in it.

01:38:58.167 --> 01:38:59.750
When you see boss in school tomorrow,

01:39:00.833 --> 01:39:02.667
don't forget to thank him.

01:39:04.375 --> 01:39:05.500
Bye bye.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:19.542
Lin Truly.

01:39:19.667 --> 01:39:23.625
Today's your birthday, let's go to...

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:24.708
Chicken House...

01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:27.083
Great! Hand-shredded chicken set for me.

01:39:27.208 --> 01:39:28.625
I'm gonna have two.

01:39:30.458 --> 01:39:31.417
Look! it's Hsu Taiyu.

01:39:31.542 --> 01:39:32.542
Who is he looking for?

01:39:32.667 --> 01:39:33.333
Hsu Taiyu.

01:39:35.708 --> 01:39:37.292
Lin Truly...

01:39:37.417 --> 01:39:38.583
9° 90 go.

01:39:38.833 --> 01:39:41.583
He came to see you, Lin Truly.

01:39:42.208 --> 01:39:43.625
Happy birthday...

01:39:45.208 --> 01:39:46.708
So romantic!

01:40:14.542 --> 01:40:15.083
Last night...

01:40:15.208 --> 01:40:16.167
Thank you.

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.167
Oh. You're welcome.

01:40:18.542 --> 01:40:19.792
Did you like it?

01:40:20.333 --> 01:40:22.167
Of course!

01:40:23.375 --> 01:40:24.500
Happy birthday.

01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:29.958
What did you want to say?

01:40:30.625 --> 01:40:32.250
Small and Meimei are waiting for me.

01:40:32.375 --> 01:40:34.500
We're discussing where to go for dinner.

01:40:36.708 --> 01:40:37.792
Do you want to join us?

01:40:39.417 --> 01:40:40.667
By the way.

01:40:41.292 --> 01:40:43.083
Please write this for me.

01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:44.458
Make sure you...

01:40:45.542 --> 01:40:46.417
fill in your personal info

01:40:46.542 --> 01:40:48.167
like the sample on page 1.

01:40:51.375 --> 01:40:51.875
What's wrong?

01:40:52.375 --> 01:40:53.250
Taiyu...

01:41:01.375 --> 01:41:02.375
Were you looking for me?

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.708
For what?

01:41:15.708 --> 01:41:16.792
Wait for me here.

01:41:27.167 --> 01:41:28.833
So you came for Minmin?

01:41:30.542 --> 01:41:31.958
You should've told me...

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.458
you came for Minmin to...

01:41:37.583 --> 01:41:38.792
She told me she likes me.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.167
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

01:41:55.917 --> 01:41:57.792
Hmmm...congratulations.

01:41:58.458 --> 01:41:59.583
What a surprise!

01:41:59.708 --> 01:42:01.667
I even helped you chase her for so long.

01:42:03.208 --> 01:42:04.250
Congratulations.

01:42:04.875 --> 01:42:06.167
Finally.

01:42:06.458 --> 01:42:07.667
Thank you.

01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:11.583
<i>It'll</i> definitely work out

01:42:11.708 --> 01:42:12.917
between Ouyang and you.

01:42:14.583 --> 01:42:15.667
Good luck.

01:42:21.417 --> 01:42:22.375
Thanks.

01:42:23.792 --> 01:42:26.167
I'm...really happy for you.

01:42:40.333 --> 01:42:41.583
It's pouring rain...

01:42:45.583 --> 01:42:46.750
Goodbye.

01:42:48.625 --> 01:42:49.917
Come with us...

01:42:54.375 --> 01:42:56.167
it's 0k. Thanks.

01:43:53.708 --> 01:43:55.625
Look! It says that

01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:57.750
Andy Lau has a girlfriend!

01:43:57.875 --> 01:44:00.833
What? It must be rumor.

01:44:00.958 --> 01:44:03.750
Andy Lau will never get married.

01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:07.292
<i>We all dreamed of marrying our idols,</i>

01:44:07.417 --> 01:44:08.542
That must be a rumor.

01:44:08.667 --> 01:44:10.250
<i>But in reality...</i>

01:44:11.208 --> 01:44:13.750
<i>Of course
Andy Lau belongs to someone else.</i>

01:44:15.208 --> 01:44:16.667
<i>Same for our first love.</i>

01:44:17.208 --> 01:44:19.792
<i>Of course we can't beat girls like Minmin.</i>

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Morning.

01:44:34.625 --> 01:44:35.958
Don't cry.

01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:37.042
Morning.

01:44:37.583 --> 01:44:39.333
Going abroad as soon as he got you.

01:44:39.458 --> 01:44:41.250
He was just fooling you.

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:42.750
In the end...

01:44:42.875 --> 01:44:45.333
we shouldn't have trusted a freak who

01:44:45.458 --> 01:44:47.167
separates sesame dressing from noodles.

01:45:59.250 --> 01:46:00.583
I heard that Director Chuan

01:46:00.917 --> 01:46:03.250
caught him fighting with others

01:46:03.375 --> 01:46:04.417
and wanted to kick him out of the school.

01:46:04.542 --> 01:46:06.542
That's why his dad sent him abroad.

01:46:06.958 --> 01:46:07.833
What? Really?

01:46:07.958 --> 01:46:08.917
Shhh...

01:46:09.542 --> 01:46:10.792
Quiet. Here she comes.

01:46:12.417 --> 01:46:13.750
What are you talking about?

01:46:13.875 --> 01:46:15.375
We are here to study.

01:46:15.792 --> 01:46:17.375
Yes -Right.

01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:22.542
<i>Back then, there was no facebook.</i>

01:46:23.583 --> 01:46:25.208
<i>12,000km means</i>

01:46:25.625 --> 01:46:27.417
<i>parting for good.</i>

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:31.250
<i>But sometimes</i>

01:46:31.375 --> 01:46:32.875
<i>there were some moments,</i>

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.625
<i>I felt he would appear</i>

01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:36.208
<i>the next second.</i>

01:46:37.167 --> 01:46:38.042
Are you ok?

01:46:38.167 --> 01:46:39.292
Be careful.

01:46:41.667 --> 01:46:42.875
This is the ultimate note.

01:46:43.708 --> 01:46:44.625
Let's go roller skating

01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:46.250
after you finish the exam.

01:46:46.375 --> 01:46:47.458
Or...

01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:49.042
do you want to go to the movies?

01:46:49.167 --> 01:46:51.667
Ah! Stephen Chow's
”Monkey King” is on again.

01:46:51.792 --> 01:46:53.250
I want to watch it again.

01:46:53.625 --> 01:46:54.500
Last time...

01:46:54.625 --> 01:46:55.583
I didn't quite get it.

01:47:05.375 --> 01:47:06.792
<i>Hsu Taiyu left.</i>

01:47:07.792 --> 01:47:09.250
<i>My life</i>

01:47:09.375 --> 01:47:11.792
<i>seemed to be back to the same old.</i>

01:47:13.583 --> 01:47:14.833
<i>But I know</i>

01:47:15.625 --> 01:47:16.792
<i>because of him</i>

01:47:17.792 --> 01:47:19.250
<i>I</i> am...

01:47:19.875 --> 01:47:21.083
<i>who I am now.</i>

01:47:21.208 --> 01:47:24.542
<i>(To: Lin Truly)</i>

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:25.458
OK.

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:30.375
<i>(You're pretty. Can I be your friend?)</i>

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:31.667
Congratulations.

01:47:31.792 --> 01:47:33.375
Finally done with the entrance exam.

01:47:35.292 --> 01:47:36.375
Thanks.

01:47:36.875 --> 01:47:37.792
I think...

01:47:37.917 --> 01:47:39.458
I did pretty well in math.

01:47:40.167 --> 01:47:41.750
Thanks for the ultimate note.

01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:46.208
Did you...

01:47:46.750 --> 01:47:47.958
listen to the tape?

01:47:48.708 --> 01:47:50.583
The one Taiyu gave you.

01:47:58.792 --> 01:47:59.917
I promised him

01:48:00.458 --> 01:48:02.167
to remind you of this.

01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:04.458
It's a shame that

01:48:05.417 --> 01:48:06.417
the ending

01:48:06.917 --> 01:48:08.208
isn't like what he thought.

01:48:10.792 --> 01:48:12.333
Hsu Taiyu! Shooting star!

01:48:12.458 --> 01:48:13.500
Make a wish!

01:48:22.333 --> 01:48:24.458
You know that I heard it, right?

01:48:25.583 --> 01:48:27.250
The person you like...

01:48:28.708 --> 01:48:29.792
is here.

01:48:37.958 --> 01:48:39.167
In the beginning,

01:48:39.542 --> 01:48:42.208
I thought whoever believed in chain letters

01:48:42.792 --> 01:48:44.667
was either an idiot

01:48:44.792 --> 01:48:46.292
or an idiot.

01:48:47.542 --> 01:48:48.458
But later I realized that

01:48:48.583 --> 01:48:50.583
she's simply a very kind person.

01:48:50.708 --> 01:48:52.042
To whoever received this:

01:48:52.167 --> 01:48:53.042
I am really really sorry.

01:48:53.167 --> 01:48:55.125
I was forced to send it...

01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:56.625
You might be hit by a car,

01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:57.667
get cancer...

01:48:57.792 --> 01:48:59.583
or...lose your family.

01:48:59.708 --> 01:49:00.333
But...

01:49:00.458 --> 01:49:01.708
I'm sure you'll turn ill luck into good,

01:49:01.833 --> 01:49:02.625
have a successful life,

01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:03.750
become wealthy.

01:49:06.333 --> 01:49:07.500
That's why I wanted to know her.

01:49:07.625 --> 01:49:09.375
Let's be friends.

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.750
I was serious.

01:49:11.667 --> 01:49:12.500
What?

01:49:12.875 --> 01:49:14.542
I thought chasing girls...

01:49:14.667 --> 01:49:16.042
was that simple.

01:49:16.167 --> 01:49:17.458
Tao Minmin.

01:49:17.583 --> 01:49:18.250
Wanna be my gal?

01:49:18.375 --> 01:49:21.208
Say yes! Say yes!

01:49:27.458 --> 01:49:28.833
Later I realized...

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.500
if you really like someone...

01:49:33.167 --> 01:49:34.417
you might not even notice it.

01:49:36.958 --> 01:49:39.417
I was actually super nervous that day.

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:43.375
I have to thank that car.

01:49:43.625 --> 01:49:45.625
The moment I held her in my arm...

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:47.250
I realized that I never knew...

01:49:47.583 --> 01:49:50.167
my heart...can beat so fast.

01:49:53.417 --> 01:49:56.208
What...were you...talking about?

01:49:56.375 --> 01:49:59.542
I didn't want her to misunderstand.

01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:01.792
But somehow...

01:50:02.375 --> 01:50:04.042
at the end of that day

01:50:04.167 --> 01:50:05.708
she didn't seem happy.

01:50:08.542 --> 01:50:10.292
When you like someone

01:50:11.625 --> 01:50:15.458
and see her walk to someone she likes,

01:50:16.542 --> 01:50:18.208
you'd suddenly realize that

01:50:19.583 --> 01:50:20.750
you treat her badly just because

01:50:23.792 --> 01:50:26.667
you want to get a bit closer to her.

01:50:36.708 --> 01:50:37.792
For me?

01:50:39.958 --> 01:50:41.625
You'll keep every word she said

01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:43.458
in mind.

01:50:44.375 --> 01:50:45.417
Nothing's wrong.

01:50:45.833 --> 01:50:47.167
Bye.

01:50:48.917 --> 01:50:51.208
When we say nothing's wrong...

01:50:51.583 --> 01:50:52.542
it means something's wrong.

01:50:52.667 --> 01:50:54.042
When we say it's 0k,

01:50:54.167 --> 01:50:55.417
it means it's not 0k.

01:51:01.167 --> 01:51:02.167
Are you ok?

01:51:02.583 --> 01:51:04.250
I didn't know that when I'm in love,

01:51:05.167 --> 01:51:06.750
I actually have no courage to tell her.

01:51:08.875 --> 01:51:09.542
On that night,

01:51:09.667 --> 01:51:11.292
I made a wish upon a shooting star.

01:51:12.292 --> 01:51:13.917
I wish I was also

01:51:14.333 --> 01:51:15.375
in her wish.

01:51:16.792 --> 01:51:20.375
Even if I know it's someone else

01:51:20.708 --> 01:51:21.958
who could make her happy...

01:51:24.417 --> 01:51:27.667
Sometimes...she still pretends to be ok

01:51:28.583 --> 01:51:30.167
even when she feels very sad.

01:51:30.958 --> 01:51:32.750
Spending 5 minutes deciding what to have,

01:51:33.792 --> 01:51:35.833
before choosing the same old raddish cake.

01:51:37.833 --> 01:51:39.792
She doesn't watch where she's going.

01:51:40.833 --> 01:51:43.458
Please watch her at all times.

01:51:43.583 --> 01:51:44.458
Are you ok?

01:51:45.208 --> 01:51:46.292
She wants to go to Taiwan University,

01:51:46.417 --> 01:51:47.958
but she's really bad at math.

01:51:49.833 --> 01:51:50.792
She likes roller skating,

01:51:50.917 --> 01:51:52.333
loves Stephen Chow's films...

01:51:52.458 --> 01:51:53.500
Let's go roller skating

01:51:53.625 --> 01:51:54.667
after you finish the exam.

01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:56.208
She...

01:52:03.708 --> 01:52:05.167
likes you very much.

01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:08.958
I didn't know that

01:52:09.542 --> 01:52:10.792
he disappeared for so long

01:52:11.417 --> 01:52:12.792
was because he had a surgery.

01:52:32.292 --> 01:52:33.375
Do you see that?

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.583
You have a blood clot here.

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:38.458
This is why you passed out when running.

01:52:38.583 --> 01:52:41.042
It might be caused by the car accident.

01:52:41.167 --> 01:52:42.292
That sounds really bad!

01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:45.875
Should've charged the driver more.

01:52:46.583 --> 01:52:47.958
You really should.

01:52:48.625 --> 01:52:49.750
You'll need a surgery

01:52:49.875 --> 01:52:51.333
and stay in the hospital.

01:52:51.458 --> 01:52:53.667
Your family has to come to look after you.

01:52:55.875 --> 01:52:57.542
He wanted me to keep the secret.

01:52:57.917 --> 01:52:58.792
Iguessu.

01:52:59.375 --> 01:53:02.708
He didn't want you to blame yourself.

01:53:04.167 --> 01:53:06.833
His family told the school long time ago

01:53:06.958 --> 01:53:08.583
that they wanted to take him to the U.S..

01:53:10.542 --> 01:53:11.625
Hsu Taiyu.

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.375
I hope you can start over again

01:53:14.833 --> 01:53:16.625
after arriving in the U.S..

01:53:17.625 --> 01:53:18.667
Director.

01:53:21.417 --> 01:53:22.458
Thank you.

01:53:23.667 --> 01:53:25.042
Sakuraki said that

01:53:25.167 --> 01:53:27.542
Hsu hasn't come to school for a week.

01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:29.708
He's even absent from the mock exam.

01:53:31.292 --> 01:53:33.667
Aren't you moving to the U.S. soon?

01:53:33.792 --> 01:53:34.792
Why are you still studying this?

01:53:35.833 --> 01:53:37.167
Because...

01:53:38.250 --> 01:53:39.375
I made a promise.

01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:40.958
Can you...

01:53:42.333 --> 01:53:43.542
be that Hsu Taiyu again?

01:53:44.625 --> 01:53:46.792
Why did you...fight again?

01:53:46.917 --> 01:53:48.167
For no reason.

01:53:49.167 --> 01:53:50.458
They wanted to fight.

01:53:50.583 --> 01:53:51.792
So I fought with them.

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.333
Sorry for coming here so late

01:54:01.458 --> 01:54:03.250
and asking that standee for free.

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:04.375
Sorry.

01:54:07.375 --> 01:54:08.625
Hsu Taiyu.

01:54:09.458 --> 01:54:10.375
I finally

01:54:11.208 --> 01:54:12.375
90'! you.

01:54:12.792 --> 01:54:14.167
It's Andy Lau!

01:54:15.542 --> 01:54:16.917
Don't you motherfucker dodge!

01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.167
You want me to invite your gal for tea?

01:54:19.625 --> 01:54:20.625
She always goes to

01:54:20.917 --> 01:54:22.583
that teashop to study.

01:54:22.917 --> 01:54:24.250
Class...

01:54:24.375 --> 01:54:25.458
304...

01:54:25.583 --> 01:54:27.625
Lin...Tru...ly...

01:54:28.708 --> 01:54:29.792
Don't you ever touch her!

01:54:29.917 --> 01:54:33.083
It depends on whether you're a good boy...

01:54:33.208 --> 01:54:37.417
whether you let me beat you...up...

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:38.542
Lin Truly.

01:55:40.792 --> 01:55:43.500
Now you're with the person you like, right?

01:55:52.167 --> 01:55:53.583
I won Tao Minmin's heart.

01:55:55.208 --> 01:55:56.458
You won Ouyang's.

01:55:59.167 --> 01:56:00.375
We fulfilled the promise

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.792
we made in the beginning.

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:06.750
Iguessu.

01:56:08.167 --> 01:56:10.417
This is the only

01:56:11.333 --> 01:56:13.208
and the last thing I could do for you.

01:56:15.583 --> 01:56:16.958
Lin Truly.

01:56:19.458 --> 01:56:20.542
Although you're short

01:56:21.292 --> 01:56:22.167
and stupid.

01:56:24.708 --> 01:56:26.417
And you even like someone else.

01:56:28.375 --> 01:56:29.625
Even so...

01:56:31.375 --> 01:56:32.583
I still...

01:56:38.583 --> 01:56:39.875
like you a lot.

01:57:02.375 --> 01:57:03.583
Lin Truly.

01:57:06.583 --> 01:57:08.750
If you already listened to the whole tape,

01:57:11.542 --> 01:57:14.417
just look up at the sky.

01:57:16.708 --> 01:57:18.875
Then I will know

01:57:20.375 --> 01:57:22.625
I'm looking at the same starry sky

01:57:24.542 --> 01:57:26.375
as the girl I like.

01:57:29.792 --> 01:57:32.167
I Love You

01:58:33.792 --> 01:58:37.167
<i>(The person I like: Hsu Taiyu)</i>

01:58:48.417 --> 01:58:50.042
<i>You were always wondering...</i>

01:58:50.167 --> 01:58:52.375
<i>what your future would be like.</i>

01:58:52.833 --> 01:58:54.750
<i>Now...l can give you the answer.</i>

01:58:59.208 --> 01:59:00.542
Give me the salary

01:59:00.667 --> 01:59:02.042
and the holidays I deserve,

01:59:02.167 --> 01:59:03.625
or let me quit.

01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:07.250
I don't need to waste my life

01:59:07.375 --> 01:59:08.875
in a place where no one cares who I am.

01:59:19.292 --> 01:59:20.917
Truly! Truly!

01:59:21.375 --> 01:59:22.583
What the fuck!

01:59:22.708 --> 01:59:25.417
Handwritten resignation letter...so ancient.

01:59:25.542 --> 01:59:26.792
We'd probably just send emails.

01:59:26.917 --> 01:59:27.542
Who dares to

01:59:27.667 --> 01:59:28.333
do this.

01:59:28.458 --> 01:59:29.792
You're so cool.

01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:31.417
Sometimes...

01:59:31.542 --> 01:59:33.292
it's still way cooler to

01:59:33.417 --> 01:59:34.458
do it our way.

01:59:34.958 --> 01:59:35.667
By the way.

01:59:35.792 --> 01:59:36.750
All of you have a share

01:59:36.875 --> 01:59:37.708
of my performance bonus.

01:59:37.833 --> 01:59:39.167
Yay!

01:59:44.833 --> 01:59:46.333
So you quit?

01:59:46.917 --> 01:59:48.750
How can you be so immature?

01:59:49.375 --> 01:59:51.167
Why can't you just be flexible?

01:59:51.458 --> 01:59:53.833
Everyone can stick to it, why can't you?

01:59:55.208 --> 01:59:55.708
Do you remember that

01:59:55.833 --> 01:59:57.417
once I asked you to pay card bill for me?

01:59:57.542 --> 01:59:59.458
It's true I gave you the bill quite late.

01:59:59.583 --> 02:00:00.042
But it doesn't mean you could...

02:00:00.167 --> 02:00:00.750
<i>In the future...</i>

02:00:00.875 --> 02:00:02.625
<i>you won't really become someone amazing.</i>

02:00:02.958 --> 02:00:04.625
<i>You still make mistakes.</i>

02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:06.167
<i>You still get confused.</i>

02:00:06.792 --> 02:00:09.083
<i>You still regret for not having more ice,</i>

02:00:09.208 --> 02:00:10.458
<i>or not experiencing more relationships.</i>

02:00:10.583 --> 02:00:11.792
...that's what I don't like about you.

02:00:11.917 --> 02:00:13.750
Same here.

02:00:18.917 --> 02:00:20.417
Let's break up.

02:00:21.667 --> 02:00:23.875
<i>...and being too kind to people you dislike.</i>

02:00:24.292 --> 02:00:26.375
<i>And cherishing people you like more.</i>

02:00:26.792 --> 02:00:28.042
<i>But...</i>

02:00:28.167 --> 02:00:29.750
<i>the way you are is good.</i>

02:00:30.583 --> 02:00:31.583
<i>You're still very brave,</i>

02:00:31.708 --> 02:00:33.250
<i>very naive.</i>

02:00:33.375 --> 02:00:34.458
<i>You still...</i>

02:00:34.583 --> 02:00:36.083
<i>scream for your idol.</i>

02:00:36.208 --> 02:00:38.208
Ah!

02:00:42.708 --> 02:00:44.917
How can you stay so popular for 3O years?

02:00:45.875 --> 02:00:49.792
How come I still can't get a single ticket!

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:53.958
Come on. Come on.

02:00:54.083 --> 02:00:55.833
Truly glow stick!

02:00:56.042 --> 02:00:57.250
See, I finally got the ticket.

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:58.167
Where?

02:00:58.958 --> 02:01:00.708
I've queued for a longtime!

02:01:01.167 --> 02:01:02.875
I'm in the first row at the mosh pit.

02:01:03.125 --> 02:01:06.000
Come on. Come on. Have a look.

02:01:07.125 --> 02:01:09.333
Truly glow stick!

02:01:10.042 --> 02:01:11.208
Come have a look.

02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:15.458
Hello.

02:01:15.583 --> 02:01:16.292
May I help you?

02:01:16.417 --> 02:01:17.458
Kumquat lemonade, please.

02:01:17.583 --> 02:01:18.750
No problem.

02:01:18.875 --> 02:01:20.167
3O dollars.

02:01:31.833 --> 02:01:33.042
Hello.

02:01:33.167 --> 02:01:33.792
Bubble milk tea.

02:01:33.917 --> 02:01:35.417
Bubble milk tea? Sure.

02:01:35.542 --> 02:01:37.167
It's gonna take some time.

02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:45.375
You dropped something.

02:01:53.250 --> 02:01:54.458
I'm taking a break.

02:01:54.917 --> 02:01:57.250
Just treat me as an ordinary person.

02:01:59.542 --> 02:02:00.750
Don't worry.

02:02:01.583 --> 02:02:03.500
I think you're so ordinary.

02:02:04.167 --> 02:02:05.042
I don't like you at all.

02:02:05.167 --> 02:02:06.708
I'm not your fan.

02:02:15.167 --> 02:02:16.833
This is...what my collegue...

02:02:16.958 --> 02:02:17.667
helped me...

02:02:17.792 --> 02:02:19.667
download earlier today.

02:02:20.333 --> 02:02:21.625
So good.

02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:23.542
L...don't know who's the singer...

02:02:24.167 --> 02:02:24.667
I agree.

02:02:24.792 --> 02:02:25.542
It's good.

02:02:26.583 --> 02:02:28.250
Let me play another song.

02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:39.583
Can I take a photo with you?

02:02:39.708 --> 02:02:41.167
Although you think I'm ordinary,

02:02:41.292 --> 02:02:42.458
and you're not my fan.

02:02:42.583 --> 02:02:44.250
Can we...take a photo?

02:02:45.250 --> 02:02:47.375
Yes...

02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:49.750
<i>OK.</i>

02:02:49.875 --> 02:02:51.083
Sorry, I'm a bit...

02:02:51.208 --> 02:02:52.208
HGFVOUS.

02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:01.125
Good?

02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.500
Thanks.

02:03:01.625 --> 02:03:02.167
<i>OK.</i>

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:04.208
By the way...

02:03:05.417 --> 02:03:07.375
Can you sign for me?

02:03:11.583 --> 02:03:12.792
Sure.

02:03:13.833 --> 02:03:14.333
Thanks.

02:03:14.458 --> 02:03:15.167
Oh!

02:03:21.792 --> 02:03:24.250
Can you please write...

02:03:24.375 --> 02:03:26.292
To Lin Truly

02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:28.042
L.l.N.

02:03:28.167 --> 02:03:29.875
Truly as in "Truly Madly Deeply".

02:03:30.583 --> 02:03:32.333
Lin Truly

02:03:35.250 --> 02:03:37.458
You're going to the concert tonight,

02:03:37.583 --> 02:03:38.292
right?

02:03:38.417 --> 02:03:39.708
How do you know?

02:03:41.417 --> 02:03:41.750
Because

02:03:41.875 --> 02:03:43.625
my concert is called "Truly Love You".

02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:44.583
So...

02:03:45.167 --> 02:03:46.333
you really have to go.

02:03:48.375 --> 02:03:50.042
But I couldn't get any ticket.

02:03:50.167 --> 02:03:51.458
All your concerts

02:03:51.583 --> 02:03:53.375
are sold out.

02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:58.792
Call this person.

02:03:58.917 --> 02:04:00.333
He's our staff.

02:04:00.875 --> 02:04:02.542
You have to come.

02:04:03.583 --> 02:04:04.583
OK.

02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:06.542
Thank you.

02:04:06.667 --> 02:04:07.292
Bye bye.

02:04:07.417 --> 02:04:08.500
Bye bye.

02:04:08.958 --> 02:04:09.917
Don't forget.

02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:13.250
Bye bye.

02:04:29.458 --> 02:04:30.167
Hello?

02:04:30.625 --> 02:04:31.500
Hello?

02:04:31.625 --> 02:04:33.167
Hi...

02:04:33.667 --> 02:04:34.667
hmmmm

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:38.792
Andy Lau gave me this number.

02:04:39.833 --> 02:04:41.583
I guess he told you about it, right?

02:04:43.375 --> 02:04:44.667
My name is

02:04:44.792 --> 02:04:45.958
Lin Truly.

02:04:49.542 --> 02:04:51.167
Lin Truly.

02:04:57.583 --> 02:04:59.167
Is sesame dressing...

02:05:00.625 --> 02:05:03.792
still separated from noodles?

02:05:09.792 --> 02:05:11.625
The concert will start soon.

02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:12.917
Are you excited?

02:05:13.583 --> 02:05:14.875
I am.

02:05:15.625 --> 02:05:17.125
Because one of my friends made his efforts

02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:20.292
to make the concert happen.

02:05:20.833 --> 02:05:23.500
He wanted to fulfill a promise he made

02:05:23.917 --> 02:05:25.458
to his first love.

02:05:27.250 --> 02:05:28.875
I like their story very much.

02:05:30.458 --> 02:05:32.042
I want to dedicate this concert

02:05:32.167 --> 02:05:34.792
to everyone who has truly loved someone.

02:05:36.250 --> 02:05:37.375
Thank you.

02:05:52.583 --> 02:05:53.833
Truly love you.

02:05:54.917 --> 02:05:55.833
Is that you...

02:05:55.958 --> 02:05:57.375
come up with this title?

02:06:01.375 --> 02:06:02.542
Otherwise?

02:06:10.958 --> 02:06:12.875
The concert is starting soon.

02:06:14.292 --> 02:06:15.292
But...

02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:17.167
I didn't get any ticket.

02:06:18.458 --> 02:06:19.333
<i>I'll</i> ask...

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:23.750
Andy Lau

02:06:24.583 --> 02:06:25.875
to sing for you.

02:06:26.583 --> 02:06:27.917
Yeah right.

02:06:37.167 --> 02:06:37.833
Sure.

02:06:47.583 --> 02:06:48.792
It's been a long time.
