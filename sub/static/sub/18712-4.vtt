WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:05.440
<i>Our fighters land after a brisk
but successful encounter</i>

00:05.480 --> 00:07.920
<i>with hit-and-run raiders.</i>

00:07.960 --> 00:11.400
<i>These are some of the boys who've
flouted Hitler's air offensive.</i>

00:11.440 --> 00:13.600
<i>In due course
they'll stop it altogether.</i>

00:13.640 --> 00:15.480
<i>They take it easy between raids...</i>

00:15.520 --> 00:16.880
You and Freddie.

00:16.920 --> 00:20.160
<i>Sport to be had when there's no
serious work to be done in the sky.</i>

00:25.320 --> 00:29.600
88 Squadron, two planes down,
145 Squadron, one plane down,

00:29.640 --> 00:31.920
392 Squadron, one plane down,

00:31.960 --> 00:33.680
405 Squadron...

00:33.720 --> 00:36.200
Wait, sorry, 392 Squadron?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.000
One plane down.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.600
Do you... Do you know who?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.600
The RAF know.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.320
We just process the numbers.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.360
My brother's in 392.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.600
- I thought it was romantic.
- Eurch! She was a drip.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.440
And if any man told me that
frankly he didn't give a damn,

00:54.480 --> 00:56.853
I'd frankly clip him
round the earhole.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.680
Set upon by squadrons of German
planes and one of them went down.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.603
- We don't know which.
- Have you told your mother?

01:07.920 --> 01:09.560
What's happened?

01:11.280 --> 01:16.200
This is meant to be confidential,
but... one of Freddie's squadron

01:16.240 --> 01:18.520
was shot down over the channel
last night.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.237
The RAF haven't released
any details yet.

01:20.262 --> 01:21.308
If it was him?

01:21.480 --> 01:23.360
They'd send a telegram.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.560
- Emma, why don't you...?
- My shift starts in five minutes.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.120
- It's fine.
- No, no.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.240
I'm going to be late and you
are a stickler for punctuality.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.080
- That doesn't matter.
- Five minutes.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.120
Really.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.621 --> 02:29.240
So what's the occasion, Delane?
You bought another network?

02:29.280 --> 02:31.200
Hell, no. One was enough.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.760
This is my way of showing
appreciation.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.360
Your show's done well.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.240
Numbers have been strong, I mean...

02:37.280 --> 02:39.160
"They could always be stronger".

02:39.200 --> 02:40.520
Exactly.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.040
But do you know
what's making people tune in?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.960
Well, London during wartime,
it's pretty compelling.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.520
Joe half our audience couldn't even
find London on a map.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.320
People are tuning in because of you.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.400
Which is why I want to build our
fall schedule around your new show.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.280
Enjoy your drinks, gentlemen.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.960
My new show?
Joe O'Hara's Eye On America.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.120
New York City,
state-of-the-art studios.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.880
What about the work I'm doing here?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.640
It's the Little Leagues, Joe.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.000
I'm calling you up to the Majors.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.600
Come on, Freddie.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.280
Come on.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.880
Room service, sir.
I didn't order anything.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.880
It's from Adil, Mr. Joshi.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.480
He knew you were working and thought
some coffee might be of use.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.720
Erm...

03:37.760 --> 03:40.360
Do you want me to take it back down,
Mr. Hamilton?

03:40.400 --> 03:42.280
No, no, no.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.960
There's a reason
your father hid that from you.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.600
He didn't hide it.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.800
It was just in with his things.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.040
He used to play it every Sunday
at church.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.800
When you've finished torturing the
poor thing, we've got a show to do.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.920
May I help you, madam?

04:19.920 --> 04:22.960
- Probably not, love.
- Here to see someone?

04:24.840 --> 04:27.480
We're on the edge of a
brave new world here, Joe.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.040
RCA's sunk millions into television,

04:30.080 --> 04:33.018
CBS has opened studios
in Grand Central.

04:33.572 --> 04:36.040
It's the future.
You do all right by me,

04:36.080 --> 04:38.880
ten years from now
there'll be a glowing box

04:38.920 --> 04:41.200
in every home with your face on it.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.434
Now you're giving me
the hard sell here.

04:43.459 --> 04:44.459
No.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.720
This is what I'd be giving you.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.560
- Please.
- It's my daughter.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.760
It's my daughter.
You can't come in here.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.960
 I've come all this way
and I'm seeing my daughter.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.120
I'm sorry, madam, you can't come in.
Get your bloody hands off me!

05:02.160 --> 05:03.320
Bets!

05:03.360 --> 05:05.960
It's fine, Mr. Feldman. I'm sorry.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.200
I told you.
My daughter's the main attraction.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.080
Mum, shall we...

05:12.120 --> 05:14.400
It's just I'm due a break anyway,
so...

05:15.440 --> 05:17.920
You can wrap up your show here
on Monday.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.600
Well, I haven't said yes, yet.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.600
It's a simple choice.
Do you want to stay in a warzone,

05:23.640 --> 05:26.080
or do you want to be a star?

05:33.320 --> 05:35.280
I'm sorry to hear
you're leaving us.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.280
Please have a safe flight
back to Chicago.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.000
Thank you very much.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.680
The great American exodus continues?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.264
It's understandable.

05:48.289 --> 05:50.520
I think you're gonna have to
add my name to that list.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.160
Would you like us
to book you a flight? No.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.822
Mr. Delane has a plane scheduled
for Monday evening.

05:55.893 --> 05:56.924
Very good.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.408
I hope you'll consider the Halcyon
again, should you choose to return.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.960
Your room's been covered
by your employer,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.280
so all that's left
is to collate your bar bill.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.440
I'll have someone bring it up
to your room.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.400
That's it?

06:16.440 --> 06:18.840
Was there something else?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.080
Just you don't seem surprised.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.120
Most of the Americans
are leaving town.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.720
I suppose invasion rumours
are rather alarming.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.760
Well, this isn't an evacuation.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.000
I'm not quitting because of the war.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.800
It's a fantastic career opportunity.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.760
I understand. Just a coincidence.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.600
I hope you've enjoyed London.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.440
You know, I er...
I never went to a pub.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.400
I don't think you'd like them.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
They don't serve martinis.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.080
Why are you here?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.560
Me and Martin are done and dusted.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.200
I've moved in with your aunt.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.160
So you're not going back
to Liverpool?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.321
He can beg and beg, I've made my
mind up.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.548
I've heard that before.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.440
I know. And more fool me
for not listening to you.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.920
I'm sick and tired of wasting my
life, picking up after that loafer.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.840
Besides, I missed my little girl.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.400
We'll see how long that lasts.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.760
Go on, eat your dinner.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.340
Tom, did you take Mr. Hamilton
his coffee?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.520
And did he seem pleased or...?

07:34.560 --> 07:37.600
I dunno. It's just coffee.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.280
- Stop it.
- What?

07:44.320 --> 07:46.440
They'll start calling me
the merry widow.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.040
You shouldn't worry
what the munchkins think.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.040
What's a munchkin?

07:52.080 --> 07:55.320
Don't you know?
It's this film they're all seeing.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.200
Well, that explains it.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.000
I've never been to the picture house.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.920
- No! Why not?
- Cos it's full of people.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.920
I mean, not "people".
You know, "people".

08:13.440 --> 08:16.040
- Have you told her yet?
- About Freddie? No.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.720
She's been through enough.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.360
Can I help you? Telegram, miss.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.280
Wilfred, please inform Mr. Price
in room 217 there's a telegram.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.800
I imagine his sister
has had her twins now.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.480
Er, could you check these names
for me, Miss. Garland?

08:53.520 --> 08:55.040
Emma.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.920
Pilot Officer Radimsky pancaked
down into the Channel.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.000
But thankfully
a trawler picked him up

09:04.040 --> 09:07.640
and he was transferred
to the Queen Alexandra. So...

09:12.240 --> 09:15.040
- God, you heard something.
- Toby did.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.200
We didn't know if it was you.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.080
Em, I'm sorry.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.520
Ahem. Your Lordship.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.080
- You're working late.
- Sorting through some things.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.640
So I hear Mr. Delane wanted
to see you.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.400
How much did he offer you?

10:23.440 --> 10:25.880
A gentleman never discusses money.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.480
Especially not obscene amounts.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.280
Taking a couple of souvenirs?

10:32.320 --> 10:35.280
I just don't want the next guy
to get my best material.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.920
There isn't going to be a next guy.

10:36.960 --> 10:40.200
After your final broadcast,
the show's getting scrapped.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.840
Who's going to report from London
for the network?

10:43.880 --> 10:47.760
- Nobody, I guess.
- Well, what if the President sends troops?

10:47.800 --> 10:49.440
They'll need a correspondent.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.080
I suppose Delane doesn't think
that'll happen.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.360
Or he doesn't care.

11:18.231 --> 11:19.511
Freddie.

11:19.551 --> 11:22.111
- What is it?
- We fell asleep.

11:23.151 --> 11:25.271
Yes, we did.

11:25.311 --> 11:27.591
I better go back to my room
and you back to yours.

11:27.631 --> 11:30.471
Don't I own this place?

11:31.911 --> 11:34.031
Do you want my father to find out?

11:34.071 --> 11:36.031
Your mother?

11:36.071 --> 11:37.951
You're ashamed of me.

11:41.311 --> 11:42.991
My secret's out.

11:50.529 --> 11:51.943
Though you're right, though.

11:52.991 --> 11:54.951
They'd do all they could
to keep us apart.

11:54.991 --> 11:58.911
I should start moving. I want to
visit Stan in the hospital

11:58.951 --> 12:00.551
before we're called back to base.

12:02.071 --> 12:03.991
Are we safe here in London?

12:07.271 --> 12:10.431
Optimistically, we hold them off.

12:10.471 --> 12:12.391
The Americans join the war effort

12:12.431 --> 12:15.831
and our combined forces are enough
to push back the enemy.

12:15.871 --> 12:19.071
And if the Americans decide
against helping?

12:21.431 --> 12:23.791
O'Hara's boss is sending him home.

12:25.071 --> 12:27.071
That's a shame.

12:27.111 --> 12:29.071
We could use all the support
we can get.

12:37.869 --> 12:39.986
We hope for the best,
prepare for the worst.

12:52.579 --> 12:56.271
- Mrs. Hobbs, Good morning.
- Sorry, Your Lordship, I didn't...

12:56.311 --> 12:58.271
I didn't realise
someone was in here.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.871
No, it's fine.

12:59.911 --> 13:02.271
Erm, you can come back later.

13:06.071 --> 13:07.471
Mrs. Hobbs.

13:08.751 --> 13:10.831
Yes, your Lordship.

13:16.711 --> 13:19.071
Why would I know anything about it?

13:19.111 --> 13:21.711
Because you're the eyes
and ears of this place.

13:21.751 --> 13:23.671
It's none of our business.

13:23.711 --> 13:26.551
We can't keep secrets
from each other, Peggy.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.671
That's what the Germans want.

13:28.711 --> 13:31.311
What secrets might they be,
Mrs. Hobbs?

13:32.449 --> 13:34.089
Nothing, sir.

13:34.129 --> 13:36.009
I do hope so.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.609
Because if I thought you were
spreading malicious gossip

13:38.649 --> 13:41.049
about the staff,
or, indeed, the Hamilton family,

13:41.089 --> 13:44.689
you would be out of that door,
before you knew what was happening.

14:00.729 --> 14:02.569
I fear she may be right.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.289
About the Germans?

14:04.329 --> 14:07.089
No. The other thing.

14:07.129 --> 14:09.009
Emma and Freddie.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.376
Have you spoken to Emma about it?

14:11.401 --> 14:13.449
I'm going to lay down
the law this evening.

14:13.489 --> 14:15.609
She won't listen to you.

14:15.649 --> 14:18.969
There are a thousand ways
he could break her heart.

14:19.009 --> 14:21.849
And not just because
he's aristocracy.

14:23.089 --> 14:25.929
The war as well. I've seen the way
she watches that door.

14:27.510 --> 14:30.089
One day he might not walk back
through it.

14:38.449 --> 14:40.769
Are you sure this is my bar bill?

14:40.809 --> 14:42.689
I am sure, Mr. O'Hara.

14:42.729 --> 14:46.449
But this one is on the house.

14:46.489 --> 14:48.489
It better be.

14:50.369 --> 14:52.249
- There you are.
- Thanks.

14:54.169 --> 14:56.129
Miss. Garland?

14:57.649 --> 14:59.369
Is this number right?

15:00.929 --> 15:02.649
It does seem a little light.

15:07.209 --> 15:11.649
So, it looks like Delane is shutting
down foreign reporting.

15:11.689 --> 15:14.249
You must be very hard to replace,
Mr. O'Hara.

15:15.529 --> 15:18.089
Well, this new show they're lining
up, it's gonna be big.

15:19.129 --> 15:23.329
An assistant's position maybe?
Be a chance for you to see the world.

15:23.369 --> 15:25.369
That's very kind Mr. O'Hara,

15:25.409 --> 15:27.969
but I'm in no hurry to abandon
the people I care about.

15:28.009 --> 15:31.089
I've found that war makes you
realise what really matters.

15:32.169 --> 15:34.369
I've done my bit, Emma.

15:36.649 --> 15:39.849
I-I apologise. That was...
that was very rude of me.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.449
About that drink.

15:46.827 --> 15:48.600
I have a few hours to spare
if it suits.

15:49.129 --> 15:51.609
It might be your last chance
to visit that pub.

15:52.649 --> 15:54.729
What are we doing here?

16:09.738 --> 16:12.689
- Visitor for you.
- Emma.

16:13.689 --> 16:15.489
Mr. O'Hara.

16:15.529 --> 16:18.009
- Boys.
- And what brings you here?

16:19.569 --> 16:21.529
I guess we were in the area.

16:28.009 --> 16:30.609
Mother, you're supposed to knock!

16:30.649 --> 16:32.049
Why?

16:32.089 --> 16:34.209
It's not as though you've got a girl
in here.

16:35.489 --> 16:39.409
And I need your opinion,
about my outfit.

16:39.449 --> 16:41.329
Why are you asking me?

16:43.289 --> 16:47.649
Well, you know how to dress like a...
like an ordinary person.

16:47.689 --> 16:50.889
Well, you look like you always do.

16:52.369 --> 16:55.649
Yes. That's the problem.

16:58.169 --> 17:04.049
Toby, if rumour reached you that...

17:04.089 --> 17:05.888
I had dined...

17:07.929 --> 17:09.729
with a man,

17:11.648 --> 17:14.093
what would you think?

17:14.156 --> 17:16.276
I'd assume he was a friend
of Father's,

17:16.316 --> 17:18.955
offering consolation on your loss.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.795
Great.

17:24.075 --> 17:27.854
Glass. Metal. Water's rushing in.

17:27.878 --> 17:29.999
For a second
I thought I'd already died.

17:30.039 --> 17:32.999
So? You going to tell his story on
your radio show, then, O'Hara?

17:33.039 --> 17:36.159
Unfortunately, Mr. O'Hara will be
leaving us to go back home.

17:36.199 --> 17:39.959
Well, technically,
it's er under discussion.

17:39.999 --> 17:42.239
Well, you've probably picked
the right time.

17:42.279 --> 17:44.039
Where is home?

17:44.079 --> 17:47.922
Well, I'd be going to New York,
but home would be Illinois.

17:47.947 --> 17:50.995
Go, Blackhawks.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.376
Blackhawks? What's that?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.595
Only the greatest
ice hockey team in the world.

17:54.719 --> 17:57.159
My uncle has a friend
who repairs their skates.

17:57.199 --> 17:59.759
He says Americans talk too much.

17:59.799 --> 18:02.479
But that they are good people.

18:02.519 --> 18:04.559
Well, he's got the first part right,
at least.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.919
Can I get you something, Stan?

18:07.959 --> 18:11.359
I did ask the doctor for vodka,
but...

18:12.559 --> 18:15.199
I'm all right, thank you.

18:18.639 --> 18:22.159
- I know what you're doing.
- I'm not doing anything, Mr. O'Hara.

18:22.199 --> 18:24.175
I just wanted to give you a chance
to say goodbye.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.707
OK, first, it's Joe.

18:25.732 --> 18:28.519
Not Mr. O'Hara. And, second, I get it.

18:28.559 --> 18:30.599
You want me to see the human cost,

18:30.639 --> 18:33.839
the people at the heart of this,
the ones really making a difference.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.584
You can make a difference.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.811
You know,
I don't know who you think I am.

18:38.879 --> 18:40.599
I've read about your broadcasts,

18:40.639 --> 18:43.039
how Americans react to your words,
people listen.

18:43.079 --> 18:45.199
Because that's what I do!

18:45.239 --> 18:47.199
I say the words,
I sound convincing,

18:47.239 --> 18:50.479
I turn bullshit into gold because
it's my job to keep them listening.

18:50.519 --> 18:52.359
It doesn't mean that I believe it.

18:53.559 --> 18:55.439
It's just the job.

18:55.479 --> 18:58.039
I'm sorry. Really.

18:58.079 --> 19:00.399
But you've got the wrong guy.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.959
Who's this, then?
No, no wait, let me guess.

19:29.879 --> 19:31.519
Hutch, right?

19:32.599 --> 19:34.999
One of mum's favourites.

19:45.759 --> 19:49.439
She asked you for money yet?

19:51.079 --> 19:52.919
It's coming. You know it is.

19:54.879 --> 19:56.919
- Always does.
- Honestly, she's changed.

19:56.959 --> 19:58.719
You must see that.

19:58.759 --> 20:01.279
She's drinking less.
Her hems are longer.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.999
I really think this time
she'll stick around.

20:06.119 --> 20:08.079
Of course.

20:14.719 --> 20:17.879
If you're going to patronise me,
Sonny, you could at least try harder.

20:17.919 --> 20:21.239
Your mother is waiting in the bar!

20:21.279 --> 20:23.079
What's she doing here?

20:26.679 --> 20:29.746
Glad you've finally decided
to show up.

20:29.771 --> 20:34.439
- This pickaninny won't serve me.
- Mum, this is where I work.

20:34.479 --> 20:36.663
You can't just keep showing up
unannounced.

20:36.725 --> 20:38.679
You think I'm not good
enough for this place..

20:38.719 --> 20:41.399
- No, I didn't mean that.
- Well, I was good enough once!

20:42.399 --> 20:44.159
I know I don't deserve
another chance.

20:44.199 --> 20:48.439
I'm sorry, love.
Sometimes I... I just don't think.

20:48.479 --> 20:51.319
That's right, Gloria. You don't.

20:51.359 --> 20:54.239
Betsey just meant that tables
need to be reserved in advance.

20:54.279 --> 20:59.759
But don't worry,
we keep this one free, for VIPs.

21:03.239 --> 21:05.959
Well, if you're sure.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.039
Thank you.

21:08.079 --> 21:10.239
Thank you very much.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.079
No heckling during tonight's show.

22:01.599 --> 22:03.639
What do you think, Billy?

22:03.679 --> 22:05.999
I reckon it's the Messerschmitt 109.

22:06.039 --> 22:09.759
You've got a good eye,
I'll give you that.

22:15.199 --> 22:17.599
Why the hell is everyone
just standing around?

22:17.639 --> 22:19.799
There's a dogfight in the sky.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.599
We're in a goddamn warzone!

22:21.639 --> 22:23.599
These people are nuts.

22:39.657 --> 22:42.657
I can't be the only one who thinks
that this is terrifying,

22:42.697 --> 22:44.897
German planes over the city.

22:44.937 --> 22:48.777
It's not good. It shows they're
getting closer every day.

22:50.177 --> 22:52.177
And...

22:53.457 --> 22:55.617
they've been dropping
propaganda leaflets

22:55.657 --> 22:57.377
up and down the coast as well.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.497
So why is nobody scared?

22:59.537 --> 23:02.457
Don't mistake fortitude
for fearlessness.

23:07.059 --> 23:09.177
You know, this new job, it's...

23:09.919 --> 23:11.904
what I've been waiting for it
all my life.

23:11.943 --> 23:14.983
- You don't have to explain yourself.
- I've never had a problem leaving.

23:15.023 --> 23:17.743
Jobs, cities, girls;

23:17.783 --> 23:20.503
You give me ten minutes
and my bags are packed.

23:20.543 --> 23:22.543
And are your bags packed?

23:24.143 --> 23:25.943
I'm halfway there.

23:28.023 --> 23:32.063
<i>The evacuation of British children
is going smoothly and efficiently.</i>

23:32.103 --> 23:34.303
<i>The Ministry of Health
says great progress</i>

23:34.343 --> 23:36.183
<i>is being made
with the first part...</i>

23:36.223 --> 23:38.423
Excuse me!

23:38.463 --> 23:41.183
<i>Railways, the road transport
organisations,</i>

23:41.223 --> 23:43.503
<i>the local authorities and teachers,</i>

23:43.543 --> 23:46.663
<i>the voluntary workers and the
householders in reception areas...</i>

23:46.703 --> 23:48.783
- Shall we sit here?
- Yes.

23:48.823 --> 23:51.143
<i>Are all playing their part
splendidly.</i>

23:53.903 --> 23:55.823
Well, it's bigger than I expected.

23:55.863 --> 23:58.743
Well, yes, it's for all the people.

24:02.303 --> 24:04.463
Have you really never been curious
to come?

24:04.503 --> 24:07.263
I suppose.

24:07.303 --> 24:10.863
It simply never occurred to me that
I might be the one missing out.

24:14.343 --> 24:20.703
That there, the er, Ostrava,
that's a Polish vodka, right?

24:20.743 --> 24:23.503
It's Czechoslovakian.
But it's on the border with Poland.

24:23.543 --> 24:25.303
Good enough.

24:29.583 --> 24:32.223
No, no, no, no.
I want the whole bottle.

24:34.703 --> 24:39.863
Mr. O'Hara, erm it's not my place
to say, but you may have a problem.

24:39.903 --> 24:42.303
Just give me the bottle, Adil.

24:42.343 --> 24:44.783
Very well.

24:48.703 --> 24:50.783
You don't need to send coffee up
to my room.

24:50.823 --> 24:56.103
I'm sorry, Mr. Hamilton,
I just thought,

24:56.143 --> 24:57.903
I know you work long hours and...

24:57.943 --> 25:01.223
While I appreciate the attempts
at a friendship,

25:01.263 --> 25:04.383
- there is a line and I think...
- Of course, Mr. Hamilton.

25:04.423 --> 25:06.703
I... I am sorry if I crossed it.

25:06.743 --> 25:08.023
Right.

25:09.183 --> 25:13.503
Yes. Er, no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too. I...

25:13.543 --> 25:15.383
Please.

25:15.423 --> 25:18.023
You have nothing to apologise for,
sir.

25:20.063 --> 25:21.823
Right.

26:05.863 --> 26:07.663
I didn't know
you'd taken up smoking.

26:07.703 --> 26:09.503
I was just looking at it.

26:10.983 --> 26:12.943
- It's only a lighter, Sonny.
- Of course.

26:14.343 --> 26:15.543
It's only a lighter.

26:15.583 --> 26:17.703
It's only a few drinks.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.903
A few meals.

26:19.943 --> 26:21.743
A sob story at the end

26:21.783 --> 26:24.663
and Betsey handing over her wages
to help her poor old mum.

26:24.703 --> 26:27.303
I didn't come here for a handout.

26:27.343 --> 26:29.183
Just thought you'd help yourself.

26:29.223 --> 26:31.943
It's all right for you.
Places like this.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.423
- You wouldn't understand.
- Believe me...

26:36.463 --> 26:38.663
I understand.

26:47.983 --> 26:50.903
Betsey offers you anything,
you say no.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.143
She's not gonna drop her knickers
for you

26:53.183 --> 26:55.423
just because you throw
some of your cash around.

26:55.463 --> 26:57.103
That's the other thing.

26:57.143 --> 27:00.463
She doesn't ever find out
about this.

27:08.503 --> 27:10.463
Do you know the worst thing?

27:10.503 --> 27:12.303
She still thinks the world of you.

27:13.543 --> 27:15.503
Even after all you've done to her.

27:33.703 --> 27:35.383
Is he worse?

27:35.423 --> 27:38.343
Running a fever.
Blood pressure's low.

27:39.423 --> 27:42.183
It's er... a gift.

27:42.223 --> 27:44.183
You can put it on the table.

27:48.783 --> 27:50.343
Hey, Joe.

27:51.343 --> 27:53.063
Hey, there, buddy.

27:53.103 --> 27:54.983
You have not gone yet?

27:55.983 --> 27:57.303
Tomorrow.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.063
After my last broadcast.

27:59.103 --> 28:00.823
How do I look?

28:00.863 --> 28:02.903
Terrible.

28:06.463 --> 28:09.983
My wife is on the train now
from Newcastle.

28:10.023 --> 28:12.143
I don't want her to worry.

28:12.183 --> 28:14.303
She will be angry.

28:15.343 --> 28:17.303
Because you crashed your plane?

28:18.743 --> 28:20.423
Because I will fly again.

28:23.943 --> 28:26.223
My unit was wiped out in Poland.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.968
In England, though...

28:30.383 --> 28:32.023
we found a home.

28:33.543 --> 28:36.023
And...

28:39.543 --> 28:43.583
Moje miasto to zawsze pada.

28:43.623 --> 28:46.103
Stan? Stan,
I don't understand you, buddy.

28:48.783 --> 28:50.103
Nurse!

28:50.143 --> 28:51.503
Nurse! Somebody!

28:51.543 --> 28:53.023
Out of the way.

28:53.063 --> 28:54.743
Out of the way, please.

28:56.743 --> 28:58.823
He's gone into shock.

28:58.863 --> 29:00.784
What's happening?
You're gonna help him, right?

29:00.808 --> 29:01.371
Outside.

29:01.423 --> 29:03.863
- Wait outside.
- Is he OK?

29:35.703 --> 29:37.343
They have an interval.

29:37.383 --> 29:38.703
Look who it is.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.383
Like in a proper theatre.

29:40.423 --> 29:42.463
Ahem.

29:45.863 --> 29:48.783
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- What's the matter?

29:48.823 --> 29:50.903
Excuse me.

29:50.943 --> 29:52.743
Do you mind?

29:52.783 --> 29:54.543
I'm sorry.

30:04.823 --> 30:07.223
- Lady Hamilton.
- Will you arrange a car?

30:07.263 --> 30:09.223
I've seen enough.

30:09.263 --> 30:12.263
You have the right to live your own
life and do as you wish.

30:12.303 --> 30:14.746
I asked you for a bloody car.

31:27.423 --> 31:29.183
What are you laughing at?

31:29.223 --> 31:32.303
We'll all be the same when
the bloody bombs come down!

31:33.583 --> 31:36.143
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, Mr. Garland, my mother.

31:36.183 --> 31:38.703
I don't care.
Get this under control. Now.

31:38.743 --> 31:40.703
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

31:51.903 --> 31:53.903
O'Hara?

31:53.943 --> 31:56.503
Hey. I didn't realise
you were going to be here.

31:56.543 --> 31:58.223
Have you been to see Stan?

31:58.263 --> 32:04.063
Yeah. I just er wanted
to bring him... this bottle.

32:05.183 --> 32:07.463
Listen, Freddie.

32:11.092 --> 32:13.343
Stan's dead.

32:14.423 --> 32:18.823
I'm sorry. The doctor said
it was septic shock, that...

32:18.863 --> 32:24.143
it happens and er... I'm sorry.

32:24.183 --> 32:25.823
What did he say?

32:26.863 --> 32:28.583
His last words.

32:28.623 --> 32:30.383
Well, he said he was going
to fly again.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.983
Can I buy you a drink?

32:36.023 --> 32:38.063
I'm due back at base in an hour.

32:38.103 --> 32:40.943
- You're a tough kid, Freddie.
- No, I'm not.

32:40.983 --> 32:42.823
We just don't have a choice.

33:00.183 --> 33:02.183
I'm sorry about this.

33:06.383 --> 33:08.383
Betsey.

33:19.383 --> 33:21.583
At least we know
where you get it from.

33:22.903 --> 33:25.023
She'll be gone tomorrow.

33:26.023 --> 33:27.983
You don't know that.

33:28.023 --> 33:30.663
I just wish she'd come out
and say it.

33:30.703 --> 33:34.183
That she regrets having me,
that I was a mistake.

33:36.103 --> 33:39.183
Then I wish she'd go for good
so I don't have to waste my time,

33:39.223 --> 33:41.463
waiting and hoping
for her to come back.

33:54.623 --> 33:56.983
Hey!

33:57.023 --> 33:59.303
Exactly how good were my numbers?

33:59.343 --> 34:01.343
Like I said, could always be better.

34:01.383 --> 34:03.223
But they were going up.
Week after week.

34:04.263 --> 34:08.422
Delane, I think we've got something
special right here, right now.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.103
- Trust me, it'll pass.
- I disagree.

34:11.143 --> 34:15.822
This is the story; A nation standing
alone on the edge of war

34:15.862 --> 34:18.463
and you want to end our entire
foreign correspondence.

34:18.503 --> 34:22.223
The hillbillies didn't wanna hear about
my brother in the Argonne Forest in 1918

34:22.263 --> 34:24.703
and they sure don't want
to hear about this right now.

34:24.743 --> 34:26.902
I'm not asking you
to support intervention.

34:26.943 --> 34:30.902
Good. Because over one hundred
thousand fine American men

34:30.943 --> 34:32.902
never made it home last time

34:32.943 --> 34:34.703
and it didn't change
a goddamn thing.

34:34.743 --> 34:36.983
We can't just turn our backs
on the people here.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.983
Sleep it off, Joe.

34:40.023 --> 34:44.422
When you're in a lifeboat, it's best
to stop rocking. Listen to me.

34:44.463 --> 34:47.023
We can make a difference
and we don't have to strap on a gun

34:47.063 --> 34:49.623
or set foot in a cockpit,
just through words on the radio.

34:49.663 --> 34:51.382
Are you done?

34:54.862 --> 34:56.943
Yeah, I guess I am.

34:59.223 --> 35:01.223
Have a good flight.

35:44.015 --> 35:46.095
Mr. Delane.

35:46.135 --> 35:48.015
I hope you have a safe flight.

35:48.055 --> 35:49.895
Thank you, Mr. Garland.

35:49.935 --> 35:52.215
Do you wish us to send someone up
to Mr. O'Hara's room

35:52.255 --> 35:53.855
to make sure he's ready?

35:54.642 --> 35:57.322
I believe Mr. O'Hara is staying.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.162
What happened?

36:00.202 --> 36:03.202
Well, that's the trouble
with someone who talks for a living.

36:03.242 --> 36:06.802
Sometimes they just don't know
when to shut up.

36:07.802 --> 36:10.122
Freddie says you were with Stan
when he...

36:13.082 --> 36:15.322
I'm sorry.

36:16.602 --> 36:18.602
Me too.

36:22.082 --> 36:24.442
Can I help at all?

36:29.042 --> 36:32.322
Actually... yeah, you can.

36:34.082 --> 36:35.802
You can get me some ice.

36:35.842 --> 36:37.722
I've never been summoned before.

36:37.762 --> 36:40.522
We shouldn't have looked over
at her Ladyship in the cinema.

36:40.562 --> 36:43.522
Eyes and ears at the back of her
head. Could tell we were gossiping.

36:43.562 --> 36:46.082
She can't sack me anyway.
I don't even work here.

36:49.042 --> 36:51.282
Stay calm. I will do the talking.

37:05.242 --> 37:07.002
Good morning.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.682
Sonny, you ready to start?

37:12.722 --> 37:15.282
I think I might have embarrassed you
last night.

37:22.002 --> 37:23.842
<i>You didn't embarrass me.</i>

37:23.882 --> 37:25.882
You embarrassed yourself.

37:28.242 --> 37:32.002
You've got a whole new life
for yourself here.

37:33.282 --> 37:36.042
Left us all behind.

37:36.082 --> 37:38.602
I don't feel like I belong anymore.

37:40.122 --> 37:42.562
You're going back to him.

37:43.882 --> 37:46.402
He needs me, Bets.

37:46.442 --> 37:49.402
You'll be needing money
for the bus fare, then.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.082
I just wanted to see my little girl.

37:55.912 --> 37:57.882
Make sure she was fine.

38:01.042 --> 38:02.882
Don't you work her too hard, Sonny.

38:04.122 --> 38:06.082
I can't promise anything, Miss. Day.

38:15.962 --> 38:18.442
You were never a bloody mistake.

38:38.642 --> 38:42.762
So, what do you want to see us
about, Your Ladyship?

38:42.802 --> 38:45.442
That's a lovely accent.
Where are you from?

38:45.482 --> 38:48.562
Er, Edinburgh, Your Ladyship.

38:48.602 --> 38:50.242
The Athens of the North.

38:51.282 --> 38:54.042
Don't look so worried, my dear.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.682
As I've chosen to spend more time
at the hotel,

38:57.722 --> 39:03.442
I thought it would be prudent
to get to know some of my staff.

39:03.482 --> 39:07.082
Er, well, I actually don't er...
We are all facing difficult times.

39:07.122 --> 39:10.802
And we need to pull together.

39:12.042 --> 39:14.122
You know what they say?

39:15.362 --> 39:18.762
Careless talk costs lives.

39:26.042 --> 39:27.802
Good.

39:27.842 --> 39:29.562
You may go.

39:35.002 --> 39:36.562
One more thing.

39:38.602 --> 39:40.602
How does it end?

39:40.642 --> 39:43.002
The motion picture.

39:43.042 --> 39:46.762
Erm, a bit of faffing,
bit of a barney.

39:46.802 --> 39:49.762
He loves her, then he don't.
Bit of a...

39:49.802 --> 39:53.962
slap. And then he says, "Frankly,
my dear I don't give a..."

39:54.002 --> 39:55.442
Ahem!

39:56.562 --> 39:58.562
"A fig."

39:58.602 --> 40:01.202
Yeah. "I don't give a fig."

40:12.202 --> 40:14.922
I'm not saying I told you so.
I think you are.

40:14.962 --> 40:17.642
Just, it's no wonder
she doesn't visit much,

40:17.682 --> 40:19.602
if that's the reception she gets.

40:19.642 --> 40:21.402
Betsey...

40:21.442 --> 40:23.362
I was wrong about her.

40:24.402 --> 40:26.162
I apologise.

40:26.202 --> 40:29.562
Now, can we please focus on work?

40:29.602 --> 40:32.682
Go double time here
into the middle eight and then...

40:33.842 --> 40:35.842
Good place for a trumpet solo.

40:35.882 --> 40:37.362
Nah.

40:37.402 --> 40:41.202
I got rid of it. You were right.
I was rubbish.

40:41.242 --> 40:43.402
Are we ready?

40:43.442 --> 40:47.322
Yeah, we're ready.

40:59.322 --> 41:01.642
You can't watch that door forever.

41:04.082 --> 41:06.762
If someone had told you
and mum to stop?

41:06.802 --> 41:08.802
That was different.

41:10.122 --> 41:12.802
- What you're doing...
- I know what you're going to say.

41:14.162 --> 41:16.562
That he's titled
and it could never work.

41:17.762 --> 41:20.362
I was going to say, be careful.

41:21.362 --> 41:24.562
That won't be the last scare,
not by a long chalk.

41:26.162 --> 41:29.962
I fear we won't all escape this war
unscathed.

41:30.962 --> 41:32.962
Hope for the best.

41:35.202 --> 41:37.402
Prepare for the worst.

41:49.362 --> 41:51.482
Hello, America.

41:51.522 --> 41:55.162
This is A View From London with
your correspondent Joe O'Hara.

41:55.202 --> 41:58.162
And I want to talk to you
about two pilots.

41:59.522 --> 42:01.882
One was called Stanislav Radimsky.

42:03.202 --> 42:05.682
I only met him a few times.

42:05.722 --> 42:08.842
I know he was married.
He liked to drink.

42:08.882 --> 42:10.922
Liked the Blackhawks.

42:10.962 --> 42:15.402
And I know he died defending
this country... far from his home.

42:16.442 --> 42:20.602
He was 21 years old and his name's
not going to go down in history.

42:21.602 --> 42:24.202
His time was short.

42:26.442 --> 42:28.642
But it meant something.

42:28.682 --> 42:33.202
Then there's the other pilot...
Freddie Hamilton.

42:33.242 --> 42:35.562
Whose reaction to the death
of his squad mate

42:35.602 --> 42:37.642
was to get back into that cockpit.

42:37.682 --> 42:41.642
Right now, as I'm speaking to you,
he's taking to those skies again.

42:41.682 --> 42:44.082
There will be danger.

42:44.122 --> 42:46.722
And there will be young men
who don't make it home.

42:48.682 --> 42:51.002
These are the stories
unfolding every day,

42:51.042 --> 42:53.042
of heroism...

42:54.122 --> 42:55.842
heartbreak...

42:55.882 --> 42:58.362
honour and despair.

43:01.082 --> 43:03.802
But you don't give a damn
about any of that.

43:04.882 --> 43:06.922
At least that's what I'm told.

43:08.122 --> 43:11.442
They say you'd rather be spoon fed
mindless entertainment.

43:13.002 --> 43:14.762
But I know you're better than that.

43:15.922 --> 43:17.842
I know you deserve more.

43:18.922 --> 43:20.722
And I know you're listening.

43:24.122 --> 43:26.722
This is Joe O'Hara, signing off.

43:26.762 --> 43:28.282
Take care, America.

43:34.482 --> 43:36.322
Shouldn't you be on the plane?

43:37.322 --> 43:39.362
Stopped by to hear
the final broadcast.

43:40.362 --> 43:42.442
Well, I hope you enjoyed it.

43:43.442 --> 43:45.202
Is this stuff all true?

43:45.242 --> 43:47.202
About the pilots?

43:47.242 --> 43:49.202
Does it matter?

43:52.002 --> 43:54.162
Yeah. It's true.

43:57.082 --> 43:59.042
It's a hell of a story, Joe.

44:01.042 --> 44:03.482
I think um...

44:03.522 --> 44:06.562
I think I'd like to hear
how it ends.

44:19.202 --> 44:20.962
Mr. Garland.

44:21.002 --> 44:23.922
Where's decent that I can stay
for less than two pounds a night?

44:23.962 --> 44:26.562
You'll struggle
to find decent on that.

44:26.602 --> 44:28.562
You must know some places.

44:28.602 --> 44:31.562
Miss. Garland, Mr. O'Hara would like
a recommendation

44:31.602 --> 44:33.562
for somewhere to stay.

44:33.602 --> 44:35.322
Where do we normally suggest?

44:35.362 --> 44:39.522
Well, I hear 201 is very nice.
201? Where is that?

44:44.962 --> 44:46.602
Second floor.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.602
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

44:48.642 --> 44:51.562
Delane may have kept me on the air,
but the budget's been slashed.

44:51.602 --> 44:54.402
Don't concern yourself with it.
We look after our own.

44:57.002 --> 44:58.682
I don't suppose your generosity...

44:58.722 --> 45:01.642
It will not extend to your bar bill,
I'm afraid, no.

45:08.122 --> 45:11.442
Mr. Feldman,
bring my bags back upstairs, please.

45:11.482 --> 45:13.162
I have work to do.

45:16.676 --> 45:18.785
