02:16.344 --> 02:20.307
<i>It's one of the fastest growing
economies in the world.</i>

02:31.068 --> 02:34.195
<i>- It's not the first time the place

02:34.198 --> 02:36.281
<i>In the 1950s Emperor Haile Selassie known</i>

02:36.282 --> 02:38.365
<i>as the king of kings,</i>

02:38.366 --> 02:42.369
<i>embarked on a similar program

02:42.370 --> 02:45.414
<i>This was supposed to be legacy of Ethiopia.</i>

02:45.415 --> 02:47.291
<i>The future.</i>

02:47.292 --> 02:49.065
<i>But the next time Ethiopia found itself</i>

02:49.066 --> 02:50.837
<i>in the headlines,</i>

02:50.838 --> 02:53.339
<i>it was for this.</i>

02:53.340 --> 02:57.302
And for many of us, that
was the end of the story.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.975
So I'm looking forward to this week.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.935
I can't wait to show you Ethiopia.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.896
- I've been waiting for you, I mean,
- I tell you right now.

03:07.899 --> 03:09.689
You couldn't have picked a better time

03:09.690 --> 03:11.983
because we have old Ethiopia right here

03:11.984 --> 03:14.819
and we also have new Ethiopia right here.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.238
And that's like a that combo
is going to be so cool.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.365

03:19.366 --> 03:22.618

shows as a lot of them,</i>

03:22.619 --> 03:23.870
<i>or his many restaurants.</i>

03:33.421 --> 03:37.050
<i>He's Sweden-American,
Ethiopian-Swedish-American.</i>

03:37.051 --> 03:38.592
<i>Look, It's complicated.</i>

03:38.593 --> 03:40.825
<i>What is true to say is
that Marcus Samuelsson</i>

03:40.826 --> 03:43.056
<i>like his wife, Maya,</i>

03:43.057 --> 03:45.975
<i>was born here in Ethiopia.</i>

03:45.976 --> 03:48.936
So when is the last time
you were in Ethiopia?

03:48.937 --> 03:52.148
Four years ago, and you
can tell it's changed.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.482
Changed a lot.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.276
I'm interested in seeing an African country

03:56.277 --> 04:00.614
that was never colonized.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.701
It was never taken by Europe.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.869
No, that sense of pride,

04:04.870 --> 04:07.747
You really hit the nail on the head.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.332
I mean, that sense of
pride is also the sense

04:10.333 --> 04:12.960
of that everyone wants to come back.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.087
How does it feel coming back?

04:14.088 --> 04:15.213
Is it weird at all?

04:15.214 --> 04:17.339
You feel like you're coming home?

04:17.339 --> 04:19.800
It is weird. But end of the day,

04:19.801 --> 04:20.843
I always love it. I miss it.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.138
One foot of me is like, just Ethiopian,

04:24.139 --> 04:26.348
But then the other foot
is so Swedish or American

04:26.349 --> 04:27.267
at this point, Right?

04:27.268 --> 04:31.562
You do not speak the language,
Or any of the dialects.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.982
Ahh... You've since come back,
You reconnected with family.

04:34.983 --> 04:35.817
Yeah.

04:35.818 --> 04:37.693
But it must be weird to, I mean...

04:37.694 --> 04:38.854
It is. You need a translator.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.074
No, But... I need a translator.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.077
My wife is now my translator in life and in

04:45.078 --> 04:47.078
culture and so many things,

04:47.079 --> 04:51.498
But I think when you're a black man,

04:51.499 --> 04:53.042
when you're immigrants,

04:53.043 --> 04:54.668
when you're Ethiopian,

04:54.669 --> 04:56.087
when you're Sweden,

04:56.088 --> 04:58.194
I've been put into so many situations

04:58.195 --> 05:00.299
that I put myself into.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.636
So, I'm actually very comfortable in being

05:02.637 --> 05:04.972
uncomfortable.

05:09.726 --> 05:14.147
<i>In the 1970s Ethiopia was hit

<i>Against all odds, they made it.</i>

05:46.763 --> 05:48.639
<i>Marcus and Fenti recovered.</i>

05:48.640 --> 05:50.809
<i>Their mother did not. Marcus and his sister</i>

05:57.899 --> 06:00.067

06:00.068 --> 06:02.069
<i>Ann Marie and Leonard Samuelsson.</i>

<i>Marcus traveled and trained

06:26.845 --> 06:30.014
<i>It's been a pretty stellar rise since then.</i>

06:30.015 --> 06:33.727
<i>And in 2010 he opened
Red Rooster in Harlem.</i>

06:34.978 --> 06:36.603
I always find so paradox that,

06:36.604 --> 06:39.815
I was born into very little food,

06:39.816 --> 06:43.443
but yet sort of I made my
whole life about food.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.093
My sort of structure and
pragmatism comes from being

06:46.094 --> 06:48.741
raised in Sweden,

06:48.742 --> 06:52.245
and my soul of vibrancy
and warms to cooking

06:52.246 --> 06:56.250
and feel-based food that I love,
comes definitely from here.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.756

Oh, wow.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.223

<i>Injera bread, that's Ethiopian 101.</i>

07:26.029 --> 07:27.821
I mean, you think about
Ethiopian food right,

07:27.822 --> 07:30.741
The foundation is really the Injera bread.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.451
It's not just food, it's an implement.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.078

I don't want to say it's
a rootless existence,

08:35.182 --> 08:37.267
