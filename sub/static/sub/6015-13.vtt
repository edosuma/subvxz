00:02.227 --> 00:03.580
As a kid, my favourite ride...

00:05.067 --> 00:07.501
...was the bumper car. Remember?
Going around in a circle.

00:07.667 --> 00:09.737
There was always one kid
that could not do it.

00:09.907 --> 00:11.101
Do you remember this kid?

00:11.267 --> 00:13.098
As soon as the ride gets started...

00:13.267 --> 00:15.576
...he'd be, like, stuck
in a pack of empty cars.

00:16.227 --> 00:17.421
Just...

00:19.387 --> 00:21.298
"Excuse me.

00:21.587 --> 00:23.623
Excuse me. It won't go!

00:24.107 --> 00:25.256
Come on!

00:25.667 --> 00:27.817
It's almost over!"

00:29.267 --> 00:30.905
He always ends up
with the attendant...

00:31.067 --> 00:33.627
...hanging off that big pole
helping him steer it.

00:37.227 --> 00:38.626
"Stop crying."

00:39.187 --> 00:40.461
Then there's always
that other...

00:40.627 --> 00:42.060
One other really bad car...

00:42.227 --> 00:43.660
The helpless father-and-son team.

00:43.827 --> 00:45.658
This is another car just
not going anywhere.

00:45.827 --> 00:47.943
They're never organized.
Who's on the wheel?

00:48.107 --> 00:49.540
Who's pressing on the gas? Just:

00:49.707 --> 00:51.618
"Son, turn the wheel."

00:57.147 --> 00:58.466
All right, Coney Island?

00:58.627 --> 01:01.266
Okay, you can take the B or the F
and switch for the N...

01:01.427 --> 01:02.655
...at Broadway and Lafayette.

01:02.827 --> 01:04.738
Or you can go over the bridge
to DeKalb...

01:04.907 --> 01:06.545
...and catch the Q
to Atlantic Avenue...

01:06.707 --> 01:09.585
...then switch to the IRT,
2, 3, 4 or 5.

01:09.747 --> 01:10.975
But don't get on the G.

01:11.147 --> 01:13.183
That's very tempting,
but you wind up on Smith...

01:13.347 --> 01:15.542
...and 9th Street.
Then you gotta get on the R.

01:16.307 --> 01:18.980
Couldn't he just take the D
straight to Coney Island?

01:19.187 --> 01:20.620
Well, yeah.

01:23.027 --> 01:25.780
Okay. What time is your
job interview, George?

01:25.947 --> 01:27.141
9:45.

01:27.307 --> 01:28.581
Don't whistle on the elevator.

01:29.027 --> 01:31.416
- Why not?
- That's what Willy Loman told Biff...

01:31.587 --> 01:33.737
...before his interview
in Death of a Salesman.

01:33.907 --> 01:36.102
You're comparing me to Biff Loman?
Very encouraging.

01:36.267 --> 01:38.906
The biggest loser in the history
of American literature.

01:39.067 --> 01:41.342
- I gotta get going.
- What time's the lesbian wedding?

01:41.627 --> 01:43.822
- 9:30.
- Lesbian wedding.

01:43.987 --> 01:46.785
How do they work the bride and groom
on that? Do they flip a coin?

01:46.947 --> 01:48.938
Yeah, they flip a coin.

01:49.507 --> 01:52.419
What, was that not politically correct?
It's a legitimate question.

01:52.907 --> 01:56.024
I'm so tired. I'm gonna fall asleep
on that train.

01:56.187 --> 01:58.621
I feel when lesbians are looking at me,
they're thinking:

01:58.787 --> 02:00.584
"That's why I'm not a heterosexual."

02:02.667 --> 02:05.420
All right, Jerry, come on.
Pick up the check so we can go.

02:05.587 --> 02:07.100
- I'm paying for breakfast?
- Yeah.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.735
- Yeah.
- Why do I always pay?

02:09.907 --> 02:11.784
What am I, made of money?

02:12.067 --> 02:13.500
You bunch of deadbeats.

02:15.027 --> 02:16.779
How many tickets you paying today?

02:17.307 --> 02:21.346
Let's see. Speeding, running a
red light, no licence, no registration...

02:22.027 --> 02:25.019
...no plates, no brake lights,
no rear-view mirror.

02:25.587 --> 02:27.225
Look at that one.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.817
- "No doors"?
- Yeah, I'm fighting that one.

02:30.707 --> 02:32.902
You know, this is gonna cost me
over 600 bucks.

02:35.427 --> 02:37.657
I can't carry change in these pants.
It falls out.

02:38.547 --> 02:41.220
- Here you go.
- There you go.

02:41.427 --> 02:42.701
Thank you.

02:45.267 --> 02:46.985
That guy's not blind.

02:48.147 --> 02:50.707
So can I convince anybody
to come down to Coney Island?

02:50.867 --> 02:53.097
Gotta pick up my car
at the pound. George?

02:53.267 --> 02:55.064
I can't believe they found
your stolen car.

02:55.227 --> 02:56.546
Not only did they find it...

02:56.707 --> 02:59.096
...it was simonized,
and the front end was aligned.

03:00.067 --> 03:01.659
- That's amazing.
- So, what do you say?

03:01.827 --> 03:04.136
Ride on the Cyclone.
Hot dog at Nathan's on me.

03:04.307 --> 03:06.537
Who are you, Satan?
I'm close to a job here.

03:06.707 --> 03:08.937
- It's my second interview.
- All right, Biff.

03:10.707 --> 03:13.141
Elaine? Merry-go-round?

03:13.307 --> 03:15.343
I can't. I'm the best man.

03:15.707 --> 03:17.823
Kramer. Bumper cars.

03:17.987 --> 03:20.945
I gotta go to court. I'll get in trouble.
What's the matter with you?

03:21.107 --> 03:23.223
It could be years till I get
back to Coney Island.

03:23.387 --> 03:24.661
I can't go on the rides alone.

03:24.827 --> 03:27.580
42nd Street. Change for the D
and the double R...

03:27.747 --> 03:30.056
...the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7,
the C, K and F train.

03:43.267 --> 03:44.939
Well...

03:48.187 --> 03:49.381
See you.

04:37.427 --> 04:38.576
Hey!

04:44.667 --> 04:45.861
Yeah!

05:35.387 --> 05:39.016
- You looking for a job?
- Me? Why?

05:39.387 --> 05:41.343
Well, you're reading
the classifieds.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.577
Oh, no. No, no.

05:43.747 --> 05:46.625
I was just looking for the stock page.
Here it is.

05:47.227 --> 05:48.580
Looking for the quotes.

05:48.747 --> 05:50.146
Gotta check the quotes.

05:50.307 --> 05:52.059
Love a good quote.

05:52.707 --> 05:54.425
IBM up a quarter.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.061
What do you know?

05:56.787 --> 05:59.301
You didn't look like someone
who needed a job.

05:59.507 --> 06:02.544
Me? No, I don't.

06:03.307 --> 06:06.856
Doing very well. Very well, yeah.

06:07.307 --> 06:08.501
So you're in the market?

06:08.667 --> 06:11.818
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm in the market.

06:11.987 --> 06:13.181
Which market?

06:14.067 --> 06:16.627
Which market? The... The big one.

06:16.787 --> 06:19.096
The big market with the big board.

06:19.267 --> 06:22.703
Bull market, bear market.
You name the market, I'm there.

06:23.947 --> 06:26.142
So do you work for one of
the big brokerage houses?

06:26.307 --> 06:27.581
They wish.

06:27.747 --> 06:29.100
I hate the big brokerage houses.

06:29.267 --> 06:30.700
Hate them with a passion.

06:30.867 --> 06:32.585
Big brokerage houses
killed my father.

06:33.027 --> 06:35.257
- Really?
- Well, they hurt him bad.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.418
Really hurt his feelings.

06:37.587 --> 06:40.624
It's a long story.
I don't like to talk about it...

06:41.267 --> 06:43.861
...but I swore I would never work
for a big brokerage house.

06:44.027 --> 06:46.939
See, all they care about is money.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.896
I'm about more than money.
I'm about...

06:50.067 --> 06:51.261
...people.

06:51.507 --> 06:53.543
So I've always gone my own way...

06:54.147 --> 06:55.819
...and I've never looked back.

07:17.267 --> 07:19.462
I started riding these trains
in the '40s.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.667
Those days, a man would give up
his seat for a woman.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.427
Now we're liberated.
We have to stand.

07:27.707 --> 07:28.901
It's ironic.

07:29.147 --> 07:30.375
What's ironic?

07:30.707 --> 07:33.540
This. That we've come all this way,
we made all this progress...

07:33.707 --> 07:36.619
...but, you know, we lost
the little things, the niceties.

07:37.347 --> 07:39.577
No, I mean, what does
"ironic" mean?

07:42.627 --> 07:44.777
Where you off to
with such a nice present?

07:44.947 --> 07:46.983
- Birthday party?
- A wedding.

07:47.147 --> 07:48.865
- A wedding?
- Yeah.

07:49.187 --> 07:51.826
I didn't think people
still get married.

07:52.907 --> 07:55.102
It's hard today
with the men and women.

07:55.467 --> 07:56.616
You're telling me.

07:56.947 --> 08:00.303
- So they're a nice couple?
- Oh, very nice.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.822
What does he do,
if you don't mind my asking?

08:02.987 --> 08:04.545
- She.
- She?

08:04.707 --> 08:08.461
She. She works, he doesn't.
He sounds like my son.

08:09.307 --> 08:10.535
There is no "he."

08:11.187 --> 08:12.415
There's no he?

08:12.587 --> 08:14.623
So who's getting married?

08:16.067 --> 08:17.420
Two women.

08:17.587 --> 08:19.100
It's...

08:19.267 --> 08:20.620
...a lesbian wedding.

08:23.347 --> 08:24.541
Lesbian wedding?

08:25.427 --> 08:28.305
Yep. Yep, I'm...

08:29.267 --> 08:30.461
...the best man.

08:32.787 --> 08:34.140
Great.

08:35.827 --> 08:39.740
My luck. I don't talk to a soul
on the subway for 35 years...

08:39.907 --> 08:42.501
...I get the best man
at a lesbian wedding.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.305
No, no. You don't understand.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.025
I'm not a lesbian!

08:46.187 --> 08:49.224
I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.620
I'm really looking forward to this.

09:35.787 --> 09:38.540
I love weddings.
Maybe I'll meet somebody.

09:39.627 --> 09:40.901
Maybe not.

09:43.827 --> 09:46.739
Oh, man. We're stopping?

09:48.387 --> 09:51.185
Well, this is where I get off.

09:51.347 --> 09:53.986
- You do?
- Yeah.

09:54.147 --> 09:57.105
Hey, why don't you...? Oh, nothing.

09:57.467 --> 09:58.695
No, no. What?

09:58.867 --> 10:01.142
Well, I was gonna say,
"Why don't you get off with me."

10:01.307 --> 10:03.218
But you're obviously very busy
on your way...

10:03.387 --> 10:05.298
...to some important meeting
or something.

10:05.867 --> 10:07.425
Yeah. Well...

10:07.587 --> 10:09.942
See, I knew it was a bad idea.

10:15.107 --> 10:17.746
Hey, what's another million,
give or take? I get off...

10:17.907 --> 10:19.784
...when and where I wanna get off.

10:21.827 --> 10:24.136
I'm stuck. Could you just pull it
a little...?

10:24.307 --> 10:25.535
This'll just be a second.

10:26.307 --> 10:27.660
Don't... Don't start the train!

10:27.827 --> 10:29.021
Don't start the train!

10:29.507 --> 10:31.975
Here it is. Here it is,
the four horse in the first race.

10:32.147 --> 10:34.217
- Pappernick.
- How do you know he's gonna win?

10:34.387 --> 10:35.945
My UPS guy. Lance.

10:36.107 --> 10:38.337
The guys who own the horse are
his regular customers.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.145
Every horse he's ever given me
has won.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.059
- Yeah?
- Yeah. They've been sandbagging...

10:42.227 --> 10:44.661
...looking for a good spot.
He's been getting in light...

10:44.827 --> 10:47.944
...because they're using a bug boy.
The workouts have been unpublished.

10:48.107 --> 10:50.382
They're ready to run with him.
Gonna break his maiden.

10:50.547 --> 10:52.902
He's gonna go for a great price,
maybe 30-1.

10:53.067 --> 10:55.501
- I'm telling you, it's a lock.
- But it rained last night.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.056
Exactly. This horse loves the slop.

10:58.227 --> 11:00.582
It's in his bloodlines.
His father was a mudder.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.897
- His mother was a mudder.
- His mother was a mudder?

11:03.067 --> 11:05.865
What did I say? Let's go to the office.
I'm gonna call my bookie.

11:06.027 --> 11:07.506
Hey, don't tell anybody.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.100
Oh, man.

11:31.507 --> 11:33.259
Okay.

11:44.107 --> 11:46.860
You realize, of course, you're naked.

11:47.587 --> 11:50.545
Naked, dressed,
I don't see any difference.

11:50.987 --> 11:52.545
You ought to sit here.

11:52.707 --> 11:54.106
There's a difference.

11:54.467 --> 11:57.186
You got something
against the naked body?

11:57.507 --> 11:59.657
I got something against yours.

11:59.867 --> 12:02.620
How about a couple of deep knee
bends, maybe some squat-thrusts?

12:02.787 --> 12:04.778
Who's got time for squat-thrusts?

12:04.947 --> 12:07.302
All right, how about
skipping breakfast?

12:07.467 --> 12:10.220
I'm guessing you're not a
"half-grapefruit and black coffee" man.

12:10.387 --> 12:11.661
I like a good breakfast.

12:11.827 --> 12:14.500
I understand.
I like a good breakfast...

12:14.667 --> 12:17.898
...long as you don't wind up trapped
in a room in overalls and pigtails...

12:18.067 --> 12:19.819
...being counselled by Dick Gregory.

12:20.387 --> 12:22.457
I'm not ashamed of my body.

12:22.627 --> 12:26.381
Exactly. That's your problem.
You should be.

12:27.387 --> 12:28.581
Don't get up.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.863
Please, allow me.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.415
Oh, this is great.

12:36.587 --> 12:38.543
This is what I need, just what I need.

12:39.347 --> 12:41.383
Okay, tak e it easy.
I'm sure it's nothing.

12:41.547 --> 12:43.265
Probably rats on the track.

12:43.427 --> 12:45.304
They're stopping for rats.

12:46.147 --> 12:47.660
God, it's so crowded.

12:47.827 --> 12:49.863
How could there be
so many people?

12:50.547 --> 12:52.458
This guy really smells.

12:52.627 --> 12:54.458
Doesn't anyone use deodorant
in the city?

12:54.627 --> 12:57.187
What is so hard?
You tak e the cap off, you roll it on.

12:57.347 --> 12:59.815
What's that? I feel something
rubbing against me.

13:00.787 --> 13:03.540
These disgusting animals.
These people should be in a cage.

13:03.707 --> 13:04.935
We are in a cage.

13:05.707 --> 13:06.856
What if I miss the wedding?

13:07.027 --> 13:08.380
I got the ring. What'll they do?

13:08.547 --> 13:10.936
You can't get married
without a ring. Oh, God...

13:11.387 --> 13:13.105
I can't breathe.

13:13.267 --> 13:14.620
I feel faint.

13:14.787 --> 13:17.585
Okay, tak e it easy.
It'll start moving soon.

13:17.747 --> 13:20.580
Think about people in concentration
camps, what they went through.

13:20.747 --> 13:23.500
And the hostages! What would
you do if you were a hostage?

13:23.667 --> 13:26.261
Think about that. This is nothing.

13:26.427 --> 13:28.941
No, it's not nothing, it's something.

13:29.107 --> 13:31.667
It's a nightmare. Help me!

13:31.827 --> 13:34.580
Move it! Come on!
Move this f****** thing!

13:34.747 --> 13:36.146
Why isn't it moving?!

13:36.307 --> 13:38.867
What could go wrong with a train?
It's on tracks.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.985
There's no traffic.
How could a train get stuck?

13:42.147 --> 13:43.819
Step on the gas!

13:43.987 --> 13:46.865
What could it be? You'd think the
conductor would explain it to us.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.019
"I'm sorry, there's a delay.
We'll be moving in five minutes."

13:50.187 --> 13:53.543
I wanna hear a v oice.
What's that on my leg?!

14:03.747 --> 14:05.066
Nice.

14:05.987 --> 14:08.501
Your company sends you
on the road often, huh?

14:09.307 --> 14:12.583
Nice. Oh, hey, nice ice bucket there.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.263
Make yourself comfortable.

14:16.427 --> 14:18.383
Mak e myself comfortable?
What does that mean?

14:18.547 --> 14:21.584
Does she want me to tak e my clothes
off? Is she taking her clothes off?

14:21.867 --> 14:23.983
What if I tak e mine off
and she still has hers on?

14:24.147 --> 14:26.536
I'd look lik e an idiot.
She'd get offended and leave.

14:26.707 --> 14:28.459
So maybe I should leave them on.

14:28.627 --> 14:30.982
But what if she tak es hers off?
She'll feel humiliated.

14:31.427 --> 14:33.736
"Mak e yourself comfortable"?
This woman's unbelievable.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.625
This "comfortable" thing
could ruin me.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.824
I got it. I'll tak e my shoes off
and sit on the bed.

14:38.987 --> 14:40.136
There. That's comfortable.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.856
She can't accuse me
of being uncomfortable.

14:48.827 --> 14:50.658
I gotta tell you,
I'm pretty comfortable.

14:52.107 --> 14:53.256
Oh, yeah, it's all set.

14:53.547 --> 14:55.458
- They've got the bug boy on it.
- The bug boy?

14:55.627 --> 14:58.095
Yeah, the little fellow's
been riding his heart out.

14:58.267 --> 15:00.223
- They're gonna break his maiden.
- Really?

15:00.387 --> 15:01.786
- Yeah.
- It's a little slow out.

15:01.947 --> 15:04.063
- Rained last night.
- This baby loves the slop.

15:04.227 --> 15:07.185
Loves it. Eats it up.
Eats the slop. Born to slop.

15:07.347 --> 15:08.541
His father was a mudder.

15:08.707 --> 15:11.016
- His father was a mudder.
- His mother was a mudder.

15:11.187 --> 15:12.540
His mother was a mudder?

15:13.067 --> 15:14.216
What did I just say?

15:15.667 --> 15:17.225
Hey. All right.

15:17.387 --> 15:20.140
Six hundred, Pappernick to win.

15:21.827 --> 15:24.625
They still have no pitching.
Gooden's a question mark.

15:24.787 --> 15:27.017
You don't recover from those
rotator cuffs so fast.

15:27.187 --> 15:29.382
I'm not worried about
the Mets' pitching.

15:29.547 --> 15:33.176
- They got no hitting.
- No, they got hitting. Bonilla, Murray.

15:33.347 --> 15:35.577
- They got no defence.
- Defence, please.

15:35.747 --> 15:38.420
- They need speed.
- Speed? They've got Coleman.

15:38.587 --> 15:40.657
- They need a bullpen.
- Franco's no good?

15:40.827 --> 15:43.102
- They got no team leaders.
- They got Franco.

15:43.267 --> 15:44.780
What they need is a front office.

15:45.107 --> 15:47.302
- But you gotta like their chances.
- I love them.

15:47.467 --> 15:50.857
If they win it this year, I'll sit naked
with you at the World Series.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.019
It's a deal.

15:55.507 --> 15:57.179
Why couldn't I tak e a cab?

15:57.347 --> 16:00.384
For $6, my whole life
could have changed.

16:00.947 --> 16:03.745
What is that on my leg?

16:04.627 --> 16:06.185
I'll never get out of here.

16:06.747 --> 16:09.307
What if I'm here
for the rest of my life?

16:09.787 --> 16:11.982
Maybe I'll get out in five seconds.

16:12.547 --> 16:14.583
One banana, two banana...

16:14.747 --> 16:16.942
...three banana, four banana...

16:17.107 --> 16:18.620
...five banana.

16:18.987 --> 16:21.899
No. I'm still here.

16:22.387 --> 16:25.504
Still here. When will they
start moving?

16:25.667 --> 16:27.020
Move!

16:27.187 --> 16:29.747
Move! Move!

16:30.867 --> 16:32.346
It's moving.

16:32.707 --> 16:34.345
It's moving!

16:34.867 --> 16:36.380
Yes!

16:36.667 --> 16:37.895
Yes.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.459
Mother******!

16:47.947 --> 16:50.222
Gee, I hope you have the key
for these things.

16:50.907 --> 16:53.341
Oh, don't worry, I do.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.658
My mother used to walk
around our apartment...

16:55.827 --> 16:57.055
...in her bra and panties.

16:57.747 --> 17:00.864
She didn't look anything like you.
She was...

17:01.027 --> 17:04.223
...really disgusting, really bad body.

17:04.946 --> 17:09.098
You know, if you can imagine an
uglier, fatter version of Shirley Booth.

17:09.347 --> 17:11.303
Remember Shirley Booth in Hazel?

17:11.787 --> 17:14.017
Really embarrassing,
because I had the only mother...

17:14.186 --> 17:16.223
...in the neighbourhood
who was worse than Hazel.

17:16.387 --> 17:19.378
- You can imagine the taunts I'd hear.
- Like what?

17:19.547 --> 17:20.945
Like:

17:21.267 --> 17:23.781
"Hey, your mother's
uglier than Hazel."

17:24.146 --> 17:26.741
"Hazel really puts your mother
to shame." You know.

17:34.627 --> 17:35.821
What's going on?

17:36.147 --> 17:39.184
It was a pleasure doing business
with you, but I have to get going.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.704
Get going? But we haven't really,
you know...

17:42.947 --> 17:44.346
Eight dollars?

17:44.507 --> 17:46.623
- Eight dollars?
- What are you doing, robbing me?

17:46.787 --> 17:48.937
I wasted my whole morning
on you for $8?

17:50.227 --> 17:51.660
Wait a second. What are you doing?

17:51.987 --> 17:54.376
- I'm taking your clothes.
- No, no, that's my only suit!

17:54.547 --> 17:57.345
It cost me $350!
I got it at Moe Ginsburg!

17:57.507 --> 18:00.067
- Bye, George.
- You can't just leave me here.

18:00.787 --> 18:02.982
Will I see you again?

18:09.267 --> 18:11.337
It's Hoy's Boy followed by Jamet...

18:11.507 --> 18:14.305
...Little Baggit, Kiss Harmony
and then a long way to Flagrant.

18:14.467 --> 18:17.186
- Come on!
- Into the stretch...

18:17.347 --> 18:20.464
...with an 1/8th of a mile to go,
Stepagain, Passionel battling it out.

18:20.627 --> 18:23.266
Clear from Jamet, Pappernick's
starting to mak e some ground...

18:23.427 --> 18:26.783
...but Stepagain is the leader...
- Come on.

18:26.947 --> 18:30.098
- Come on! Yes!
- Look at Pappernick, sprouting wings.

18:30.267 --> 18:32.497
- Yes! Yes!
- Stepagain, just falling back.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.783
- Yes!
- Pappernick flashing home.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.383
Stepagain, Pappernick, Pappernick
and Stepagain to the line...

18:38.787 --> 18:42.177
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- The winner is Pappernick.

18:42.347 --> 18:45.339
Yes, yes! I won. Hey!

18:52.267 --> 18:53.416
Yeah.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.342
I haven't had a hot dog
at Nathan's in 20 years.

19:31.507 --> 19:32.860
First, we ride the Cyclone.

19:34.467 --> 19:35.946
Chilly out.

19:39.987 --> 19:41.386
French fries.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.181
Hey, hey!

19:50.627 --> 19:52.777
Give me the money.

19:52.947 --> 19:54.778
Freeze! Police!

20:00.867 --> 20:03.017
No, I never got the car.
We had such a good time...

20:03.187 --> 20:06.065
...by the time I got to
the police garage, it was closed.

20:07.067 --> 20:08.261
Too bad.

20:08.467 --> 20:11.425
You wouldn't believe what this guy
put away at Nathan's.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.737
Look at what we won. You want him?

20:13.907 --> 20:15.260
Get that out of my face.

20:15.707 --> 20:19.416
So you missed the wedding.
You'll catch the bris.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.065
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

20:29.547 --> 20:32.539
How'd you like a Hare Krishna fist
down your throat, you little punk?

20:34.227 --> 20:35.660
George.

20:35.827 --> 20:37.021
Biff.

20:37.587 --> 20:39.896
What, did you whistle
on the elevator?

20:40.107 --> 20:42.063
I have my spare key
in your apartment, right?

20:42.547 --> 20:43.821
Yeah, in the kitchen drawer.

20:43.987 --> 20:45.625
- Give me your key.
- What happened?

20:45.787 --> 20:48.938
Never mind what happened,
just give me the key.

20:49.107 --> 20:52.144
- Come on, I'll go with you.
- Here. Pay.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.339
Wait, wait. Give me that.

21:01.707 --> 21:03.220
All right.

21:04.827 --> 21:07.899
So I take the subway
down to Coney Island...

21:08.067 --> 21:10.217
...to go on the Cyclone.
I'm riding on the subway.

21:10.387 --> 21:13.424
I'm sitting on the D train
for an hour and 15 minutes...

21:13.587 --> 21:16.055
...to go on a scary ride.

21:16.307 --> 21:18.298
Okay, how dumb is that?

21:18.547 --> 21:21.619
You know that first sharp drop
on the Cyclone? Fell asleep.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.818
