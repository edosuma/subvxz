WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.771
(lyrical, chiming music plays)

00:33.834 --> 00:36.670
*

00:54.488 --> 00:56.056
(indistinct whispering)

01:26.320 --> 01:28.456
*

01:46.907 --> 01:49.410
(screams)

02:02.656 --> 02:04.725
DANVILLE:
Okay, bring her down.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.760
Bring her down.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.632
FLACK:
Our vic is Ellen White,
19 years old.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.234
She was originally from Kansas.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.236
Has no family locally
to speak of.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.537
Her classmate,
Alexa Holdman,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.372
discovered her when
she was practicing

02:18.406 --> 02:20.208
one of those
twirly things.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.242
A pirouette?

02:21.275 --> 02:23.911
Like I said,
a twirly thing.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.616
TAYLOR:
Any idea how she
got up there?

02:28.649 --> 02:32.186
Looks like the killer used
the theater's pulley system.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.688
Alexa Holdman
seems pretty together

02:34.722 --> 02:36.324
for someone who just
found her friend murdered.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.426
FLACK:
They weren't friends.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.727
Ellen was Alexa's
understudy,

02:39.760 --> 02:42.396
and that was the extent
of their relationship.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.534
HAWKES:
Petechial hemorrhaging.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.802
C.O.D.'s most likely
asphyxiation.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.371
You needed an exam for that?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.739
She was hung up by a rope.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.308
We're not sure
the rope killed her.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.244
A ligature mark
and bruising.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.678
No ecchymosis present.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.847
Most likely made postmortem.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.383
This bruising is more consistent
with being choked to death.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.884
Discoloration and swelling

03:03.917 --> 03:06.387
indicates it was
made antemortem.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.288
FLACK:
All right,
I may not be

03:07.321 --> 03:09.257
the owner of a wonderful
white lab coat,

03:09.290 --> 03:10.524
but it sounds to me
like you're saying

03:10.558 --> 03:12.660
somebody strangled her,
then strung her up.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.931
Why hang somebody
who's already dead?

03:40.854 --> 03:45.326
* Out here in the fields

03:45.359 --> 03:49.263
* I fight for my meals

03:49.297 --> 03:53.734
* I get my back
into my living *

03:56.069 --> 03:58.339
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.748
*

04:35.776 --> 04:37.778
*

05:06.707 --> 05:08.709
*

05:18.686 --> 05:19.987
DANVILLE:
I don't know, Mac.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.056
Alexa Holdman finds her
talented understudy dead,

05:23.090 --> 05:26.427
doesn't seem the least
bit upset about it.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.695
I know it's a clichÃ©,

05:27.728 --> 05:29.430
but understudies do
go on to become stars,

05:29.463 --> 05:30.831
so maybe Ellen's
was shining

05:30.864 --> 05:33.033
a bit too bright
for Alexa's liking.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.503
Danny confirmed
the pulley system

05:35.536 --> 05:36.504
was used to hang the body,

05:36.537 --> 05:38.606
a task even a 90-pound
ballerina could pull off.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.808
That's an interesting theory.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.075
There's only one problem.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.777
Hawkes said Ellen's death

05:43.811 --> 05:44.812
was around 6:00 p.m.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.946
Now, I just spoke
to the dancers

05:45.979 --> 05:47.515
and the director of the show.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.016
Anyone who's a possible suspect

05:49.049 --> 05:50.951
was in rehearsal
from 5:00 until 8:00,

05:50.984 --> 05:52.953
including the very icy
Alexa Holdman.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.690
How about Ellen?
She ever make it there?

05:56.724 --> 05:59.827
She left to use the bathroom
around 5:30 and never came back.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.729
No one thought to go
looking for her?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.731
Apparently, breaks were
pretty common for Ellen.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.898
Sometimes she'd come back,
sometimes no.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.800
No one else was in the...

06:08.068 --> 06:09.470
...the, uh...

06:09.503 --> 06:11.405
Building? No.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.774
The dancers and the director
had the place to themselves.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.142
Janitors don't get
here till 10:00,

06:15.175 --> 06:16.877
which is 15 minutes from now.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.912
Well, the victim
didn't hang herself.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.517
Someone was here
who wasn't supposed to be.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.553
Find out who that was.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.712
I'm sorry I didn't...
I didn't return your calls.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.046
I didn't know what to say.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.084
I understand why you're
angry with me, Christine.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.019
I'm not angry.

06:59.052 --> 07:02.656
Um... hurt,

07:02.690 --> 07:04.024
uh, confused...

07:04.057 --> 07:06.794
a little embarrassed.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.462
I realized I'd been acting like

07:08.496 --> 07:09.697
a teenage girl,
you know?

07:09.730 --> 07:11.064
Butterflies
in my stomach

07:11.098 --> 07:13.066
'cause I'm so excited
to see you,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.570
fighting the urge
to text message every minute...

07:16.604 --> 07:19.072
Making a lot more of this
than... than what it is,

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
so I'm going to take
a step back.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.743
No, I don't want you to do that.
Yeah, well,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.945
if that's true, then why
don't you tell me what's wrong?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.514
Why are you
shutting me out

07:26.547 --> 07:28.181
of whatever it is
that you're going through?

07:28.215 --> 07:29.850
That's not what I'm doing.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.785
This isn't... about us.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.587
Oh. Oh, okay.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.823
I get it.
It's none of my business.

07:35.856 --> 07:36.924
That's not what I'm saying.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.992
Mac, the problem is

07:39.026 --> 07:41.028
that you are not
saying anything.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.769
You...

07:48.802 --> 07:50.604
you make me very happy.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.272
I'm just...

07:52.305 --> 07:54.975
struggling with...

07:55.008 --> 07:56.877
You can tell me.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.111
You know, all those nights

07:58.145 --> 08:00.013
that I sat by your bedside
in the hospital,

08:00.047 --> 08:03.083
it wasn't because
I felt some obligation.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.885
I was where I wanted to be.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.889
I sat there day after day,
praying...

08:08.922 --> 08:13.493
because I wanted...
I needed you to recover.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.530
Mac, you can trust me.

08:19.867 --> 08:20.901
(sighs)

08:20.934 --> 08:24.638
I can't... I can't
remember things.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.210
Since the shooting, I...

08:30.243 --> 08:33.547
my... mem-memory is...

08:36.249 --> 08:38.719
It's the little things, mostly,

08:38.751 --> 08:42.188
like colors, names of
colors, foods, little...

08:42.222 --> 08:44.091
every-everyday objects.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.661
I just... I thought I could
work through it on my own,

08:47.695 --> 08:50.297
but I just keep
forgetting things.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.332
They call it aphasia.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.835
I keep seeing all these
doctors, and they...

08:54.868 --> 08:57.137
they tell me it could,
uh... it could go away,

08:57.170 --> 08:59.106
or this could be how I am.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.714
Why didn't you share
this with me, Mac?

09:08.248 --> 09:09.216
Never mind.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.119
I asked a question
I already know the answer to.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.056
You know, one of the most
endearing things

09:16.089 --> 09:19.026
about you
is your pride.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.028
But it's also
your weakness.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.764
And I-I have to decide

09:23.797 --> 09:26.734
if I can live with that.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.876
Okay.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.627
SID:
"A dancer, more than
any other human being,

09:53.661 --> 09:55.863
dies two deaths."

09:55.896 --> 09:59.366
Martha Graham said that.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.368
Though, obviously, she didn't
have our victim in mind

10:01.401 --> 10:02.703
when she said it.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.638
Then cause of death
was asphyxiation

10:04.672 --> 10:06.006
by manual strangulation.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.742
The ligature mark
was made postmortem.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.144
SID:
Yes. I also found

10:11.178 --> 10:13.046
esophageal scarring
and enamel loss.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.848
So she was bulimic.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.117
Common in dancers.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.287
But not my only discovery.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.391
DANVILLE:
Those weren't made
by the killer.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.426
Self-mutilation.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.995
Or, as the
cool kids call it...

10:28.028 --> 10:29.129
Cutting.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.932
SID:
From the look of these scars,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.433
going on over a year now.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.169
Well, our killer may have
known about her issues

10:36.203 --> 10:38.205
and wanted us to think
it was a suicide.

10:38.238 --> 10:42.209
Bruising suggests her killer
went straight at her.

10:42.242 --> 10:47.815
But I didn't find any
defensive marks on her hands.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.650
Well, if that's the case,
Ellen may have known her killer.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.693
Hey, never get
Lucy a cell phone.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.228
She's only five, Doc.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.763
I mean, never ever.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.431
I went through
Ellen White's cell.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.000
There were 500 texts
from this week alone.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.468
Wow. Anything out
of the ordinary?

11:08.501 --> 11:12.472
No, just a lot of
"IMHO"s and "FTW"s.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.341
The girl moves to
New York a year ago.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.475
Has no close
friends in town.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.911
Texts her boyfriend
in Kansas daily.

11:17.945 --> 11:21.782
I can't seem to find a reason
anyone would want her dead.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.751
DANNY:
Well, I found black trace
on the rope.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.052
Came back a mixture
of saltpeter,

11:25.085 --> 11:26.286
charcoal and sulfur.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.988
All components
of black powder.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.290
As in the type of gun powder
used during the Civil War?

11:30.323 --> 11:31.725
Before the Civil War, actually.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.927
So, how does gunpowder
from an antique gun

11:33.961 --> 11:36.063
end up on the rope
of our hanging victim?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.130
ROSS:
Messer, you got to

11:37.164 --> 11:39.399
do me a favor and tell your wife
to back off, okay?

11:39.432 --> 11:40.400
'Cause I didn't do it.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.402
Okay, and I don't like
being accused of things

11:42.435 --> 11:46.306
I didn't do when I didn't do it
because I didn't do it, okay?

11:46.339 --> 11:47.908
That make any sense to you?

11:47.941 --> 11:49.342
Yeah, he didn't do it.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.921
Hey, babe,
what'd you do to Adam?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.724
(sighs)

12:06.126 --> 12:08.361
Don't think
that you two aren't suspects.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.097
What happened
to your eyes?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.828
Adam.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.130
You know, I think
I'm a pretty nice person.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.099
Levelheaded, patient,
as is evidenced

12:46.133 --> 12:47.835
by the man I've taken
as my husband.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.136
God knows how you do it.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.270
Somebody decided,

12:50.303 --> 12:52.239
"Hey, she's an easy target.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.175
Let's play lab prank
on Lindsay because she's..."

12:55.208 --> 12:57.010
what, weak?

12:57.044 --> 12:58.846
(chuckles)

12:58.879 --> 13:00.780
Whoever did this
is going down.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.884
And you think
Adam did it?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.419
Well, I think so, but I haven't
had a chance to process

13:06.453 --> 13:08.155
the microscope yet,
so until I do,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.389
everybody's a suspect.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.992
Okay? I don't think I need
to remind you two

13:12.025 --> 13:13.493
that your fingerprints
and your DNA

13:13.526 --> 13:14.928
are in our
reference files.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.196
All this is very fascinating,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.098
and I personally
can't wait

13:18.131 --> 13:20.033
to find out who did it, but...

13:20.067 --> 13:22.035
I'm slightly more interested
in this antique gun gallery.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.971
Murder case?
Yeah.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.106
Jane Doe shot in Hell's Kitchen
24 hours ago.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.042
The gun used to kill her
discharged a loading paper

13:29.076 --> 13:32.412
that's used in front-loading
guns of the antique variety.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.947
What are you
looking for?

13:33.981 --> 13:36.583
A zigzagging wound pattern
indicated in

13:36.616 --> 13:38.218
Sid's autopsy report.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.426
LINDSAY:
We reconstructed the fragments.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.062
The bullet was
a .26 caliber pellet.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.330
The powder burns
on the victim's clothing

13:50.363 --> 13:52.199
would indicate
that the shooter

13:52.232 --> 13:54.301
was approximately
ten feet away.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.203
That brings out the color
in your eyes.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.905
Thank you.
Any luck?

13:57.938 --> 14:01.241
I think number two's a winner.

14:01.274 --> 14:05.612
Closely mimics the wound pattern
that Sid found on his CT scan.

14:05.645 --> 14:09.349
The Allen & Thurber
pepperbox revolver.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.584
It's manufactured in 1830.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.652
Pre-Civil War.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.655
You find traces of black
powder GSR on your victim?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.958
Yeah. Why?
'Cause I found black powder

14:17.991 --> 14:19.359
on the rope that was used

14:19.392 --> 14:21.228
to hang Ellen White.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.008
GSR from the gun that
killed our Jane Doe

14:35.042 --> 14:37.377
matched GSR from the rope
that hung our ballerina.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.379
Doesn't make sense.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.614
No, it doesn't.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.551
Nothing about these two murders
suggests serial killer.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.519
The women have
nothing in common:

14:46.553 --> 14:48.521
job, description,
social circles.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
Two completely different
methods of murder.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.025
And no signature

14:52.059 --> 14:53.994
left by their attacker.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.528
Still, the evidence suggests

14:55.562 --> 14:57.364
that whoever shot
our Jane Doe

14:57.397 --> 15:00.567
strangled Ellen White.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.977
MAN:
Keep moving.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.644
Keep moving!

15:11.678 --> 15:13.680
Please...
Shut up. Back up.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.949
(siren blips)

15:15.983 --> 15:17.250
Freeze!

15:17.284 --> 15:20.087
Put the weapon down!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.155
Young lady, come towards me.
Come towards me.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.356
Back away from
the weapon.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.691
Put your hands
behind your head.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.966
Patrol picked him up
holding a girl at gunpoint.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.202
LOVATO:
Same gun used to kill
the Jane Doe in Hell's Kitchen.

15:39.139 --> 15:42.409
You like shooting young girls
with old guns?

15:42.442 --> 15:43.410
I never shot anybody.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.644
Of course not.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.246
You're a good guy.
Let's see.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.016
Sam Cross,
25 years old.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.283
Highlights include:

15:50.317 --> 15:53.053
assault, armed robbery
and burglary.

15:53.086 --> 15:57.157
So, tell me, what made you
graduate to murder?

15:59.426 --> 16:00.693
Whoa, wait a minute.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.995
Murder?

16:02.029 --> 16:03.663
Look, I didn't kill
these girls.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.599
Okay? I'm just a stickup guy.
I never graduated to nothing.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.201
I can't imagine why.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.536
This is a very compelling
performance, Sam,

16:09.569 --> 16:11.004
but the fact is
we found you

16:11.038 --> 16:12.405
with the gun you used
to kill this woman

16:12.439 --> 16:14.074
right here.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.377
You shot her in
Hell's Kitchen.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.312
Any of this
coming back to you?

16:20.347 --> 16:23.216
What we can't figure
out, though, is:

16:23.250 --> 16:24.384
Why did you hang Ellen White?

16:24.417 --> 16:25.552
Why not just shoot her, too?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.287
Who the hell
is Ellen White?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.288
Look...

16:28.321 --> 16:30.623
that's not even my gun--
I found the damn thing.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.225
That's the lame-ass story
you're gonna go with?

16:32.259 --> 16:33.560
Yeah, it's
the truth, actually.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.428
Look, I've been trying
to go straight.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.763
Okay? I got a job

16:36.796 --> 16:38.298
at a, uh, gym
in Hell's Kitchen,

16:38.331 --> 16:39.432
but the owner

16:39.466 --> 16:40.800
just couldn't stop...

16:40.833 --> 16:43.236
busting my balls, so I quit.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.238
I decided to hit
this little bar I know

16:45.272 --> 16:46.273
on my way home,

16:46.306 --> 16:47.807
and, uh,

16:47.840 --> 16:50.210
she was dead when I found her.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.312
So, why didn't you
call the cops?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.047
(scoffs)
With my record?

16:54.081 --> 16:55.815
No. Uh-uh.
Hell, no.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.284
Look...

16:57.317 --> 16:59.119
I searched for a wallet.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.753
I-I found none, so...

17:00.787 --> 17:03.656
I mean, I did take
some jewelry.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.228
Look, it's not like
she was going to need it.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.596
Okay? And that's when I saw it.

17:09.628 --> 17:12.132
It was just... lying there.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.333
Lying.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.634
That's an interesting
word choice.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.469
Yeah, well, you know what?
A free piece

17:16.502 --> 17:18.238
comes your way and you take it.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.406
FLACK:
You ever visit

17:19.439 --> 17:21.074
the Manhattan
Conservatory of Dance?

17:22.309 --> 17:24.077
Maybe last night?

17:24.111 --> 17:26.213
Last night?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.614
I was with

17:27.646 --> 17:29.349
a lady friend,
yeah.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.651
So you can actually call her
and ask her about that.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.120
Just make sure her husband's

17:33.153 --> 17:34.687
not around
when you do.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.564
We any closer to
I.D.'ing our Jane Doe?

17:44.597 --> 17:45.832
Not yet.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.368
The tox results just came back.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.537
There was a blend
of chemicals in her system

17:50.570 --> 17:52.539
consistent with those found
in antidepressants,

17:52.572 --> 17:53.773
but in a combination

17:53.806 --> 17:54.807
I've never
seen before.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.509
Could be a cocktail.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.279
Yeah. I have a call in
to a pharmaceutical company.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.547
Maybe they can help.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.717
How's your search
for the lab prankster going?

18:05.752 --> 18:06.819
Fine.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.788
Finally had a chance
to process

18:08.821 --> 18:10.390
the crime scene this morning.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.694
*

18:23.570 --> 18:25.638
Tested positive
for methylene blue.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.574
That's not going to narrow
your list of suspects.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.841
We all have access to that.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.811
I also found something else.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.214
*

18:47.194 --> 18:48.695
Okay...

18:48.728 --> 18:50.297
I think I see it.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.564
Oh, it's there.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.832
Just not sure

18:52.865 --> 18:54.767
exactly what
it is yet.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.536
But I'll figure it out.
When I do,

18:56.569 --> 18:58.871
I'll be that much closer
to exacting my revenge.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.308
Remind me never

19:01.341 --> 19:03.876
to get on
your bad side.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.878
(footsteps approaching)

19:06.913 --> 19:08.315
(knocking)

19:08.348 --> 19:09.582
Is this a bad time?

19:10.617 --> 19:13.152
No.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.458
It meant a lot, you, um,
opening up to me last night.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.826
(sighs)

19:19.859 --> 19:22.195
I wish it wasn't so hard for me.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.563
Yeah, I know that.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.266
But I want you to always
feel you can come to me,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.835
be honest with me,
no matter how hard it is.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.371
I'm tougher than you think.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.740
I know how tough you are.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.375
I want to help you, Mac.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.411
Hey, I got the... Oh.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.412
Sorry. Hey, Christine.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.248
Hi.
I can come back.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.515
I-I was just leaving.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.783
What...?

19:43.816 --> 19:46.453
Oh, don't ask.
It's a long story.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.455
I got punked.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.522
TAYLOR:
Somebody thought

19:49.556 --> 19:51.624
it'd be funny to
dye her eyes...

19:53.626 --> 19:54.794
Blue.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.229
(laughing):
I see!

19:56.263 --> 19:58.631
It takes a few days
to wear off.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.233
I know I look... ridiculous.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.469
No, no. Not-not at all.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.237
I'll call you later.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.746
LINDSAY:
So... any word

20:13.780 --> 20:15.782
on Flack and Lovato's
suspect?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.285
They're still trying
to track down his alibi.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.419
But you're not convinced
it's him?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.922
Doesn't makes sense.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.324
He's a stickup man.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.625
And even if he did

20:25.658 --> 20:27.260
kill our Jane Doe, why kill

20:27.294 --> 20:29.396
Ellen White in such a...

20:29.429 --> 20:31.431
theatrical way?
Well, maybe

20:31.464 --> 20:34.467
if we knew who our Jane Doe was,
we could establish a connection.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.270
Sid found a drug in her system

20:37.304 --> 20:39.272
called Trihoxiphil.
I'd never heard

20:39.306 --> 20:40.773
of it before,
so I did some digging.

20:40.807 --> 20:41.908
It's an antidepressant,

20:41.941 --> 20:42.775
and it's currently

20:42.809 --> 20:45.412
in the human trial phase
of FDA approval.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.813
So how'd she get access to it?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.681
I called the drug company.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.783
They're currently working
with a select group

20:50.817 --> 20:53.420
of psychiatrists nationwide,
four of whom are in

20:53.453 --> 20:54.721
New York City.
You reach out to them?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.956
Yes. And only one of them
has a patient

20:56.989 --> 20:58.691
whose description
matches our Jane Doe.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.962
WOMAN:
Her name is Lisa.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.731
Lisa Weston.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.535
She's been a patient of
mine since she was 16.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.804
Who did this to her?

21:11.838 --> 21:13.005
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

21:17.076 --> 21:21.481
Did she ever mention
the name Sam Cross to you?

21:21.514 --> 21:24.083
Not that I recall.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.818
Is he the man
responsible?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.820
TAYLOR:
We're still trying
to determine that.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.422
Right now, we just need to know

21:29.456 --> 21:31.324
as much about her
as you can tell us.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.692
DANVILLE:
Did she mention
anything in therapy?

21:32.725 --> 21:34.727
Anything that could aid us
in the investigation?

21:34.761 --> 21:36.095
I saw her just this week.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.364
Everything seemed fine.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.565
What were you treating her for?

21:38.598 --> 21:41.468
She suffered
from bipolar disorder.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.103
But our work together,
plus this new trial drug,

21:44.136 --> 21:45.505
she'd never been better.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.806
What about her home life?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.708
Did she live with family,
a boyfriend?

21:48.741 --> 21:50.076
She lived by herself.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.911
Lisa came from a very

21:51.944 --> 21:53.946
privileged
background, but...

21:53.980 --> 21:55.682
she never wanted any help
from her family.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.517
As far as a boyfriend,

21:57.550 --> 21:58.951
she didn't have one--
she was very guarded

21:58.985 --> 21:59.986
when it came to men.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.754
I can check my notes

22:01.788 --> 22:03.556
from our last few sessions
together.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.425
It's possible
I overlooked something.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.793
That'd be very helpful.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.862
Dr. Emerson.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.567
Did Lisa ever mention
the name Ellen White to you?

22:19.939 --> 22:21.641
Lisa Weston
and Ellen White

22:21.674 --> 22:23.443
were both patients
of Dr. Carly Emerson.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.011
So, where's the doctor now?

22:25.044 --> 22:26.646
She's back at her
office gathering notes

22:26.679 --> 22:28.147
and files
on both of the victims.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.849
Flack and Lovato
are meeting her there.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.584
LINDSAY: Okay,
so how does Sam Cross

22:31.618 --> 22:33.853
figure into all this?
He doesn't.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.389
His alibi checks out.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.057
So, why is somebody targeting
this doctor's patients?

22:38.090 --> 22:39.726
ROSS:
Tracked the seller

22:39.759 --> 22:41.628
of the antique revolver,
and it wasn't easy

22:41.661 --> 22:43.062
because it was made back when

22:43.095 --> 22:44.497
the dinosaurs
were roaming the earth.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.533
Ran the serial number.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.500
Now, problem was,

22:47.534 --> 22:50.803
you don't need a permit
to buy and sell guns

22:50.837 --> 22:53.005
that were manufactured
before 1899,

22:53.039 --> 22:55.775
so there was no record
of the gun in any database.

22:55.808 --> 23:00.012
However, after some masterful
Internet sleuthing by moi,

23:00.046 --> 23:02.815
I was able to track down the gun
to the seller.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.552
It was bought online
two weeks ago

23:05.585 --> 23:07.754
by Dr. Carly Emerson,

23:07.787 --> 23:10.723
the psychiatrist
of our two victims.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.827
(knocking at door)
FLACK:
Dr. Emerson!

23:14.861 --> 23:17.730
Dr. Emerson! NYPD!

23:21.801 --> 23:23.603
Clear.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.684
(line ringing)

23:37.717 --> 23:38.985
She's gone.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.721
Maybe she never
went back at all.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.155
Well, it looks to me
like she was here.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.593
I got Polaroids of Ellen White,
the rope used to hang her

23:46.626 --> 23:47.860
and the Conservatory of Dance.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.596
The victim, the weapon

23:49.629 --> 23:50.863
and the location.

23:50.897 --> 23:51.998
Got it.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.533
So, what do you
make of that?

23:56.903 --> 23:59.706
Someone's playing
a game with us.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.609
Mrs. White.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.878
Conservatory.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.616
With a rope.

24:09.649 --> 24:10.717
Lisa Weston had red hair,

24:10.750 --> 24:12.151
and she was killed

24:12.184 --> 24:14.721
in Hell's Kitchen
with a revolver.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.723
Mrs. Scarlet in the kitchen
with the revolver.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.024
Holy crap.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.926
It's Clue.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.679
Six suspects.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.047
Nine rooms.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.815
Six murder weapons.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.752
324 possibilities to
deduce the killer.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.987
Dr. Emerson may have
bought the revolver,

24:48.020 --> 24:51.157
but I'm having a hard time
believing she's a killer.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.191
Science would tend to disagree.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.561
Polaroids Flack recovered
from the doctor's office

24:54.594 --> 24:57.029
had only one set of prints
on them-- hers.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.731
DANVILLE:
But she's a doctor,

24:58.765 --> 25:00.767
well-respected in the community.
She has no criminal record.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.201
Why, all of a sudden,
would she start

25:02.234 --> 25:03.636
killing her patients?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.004
And like this?

25:05.037 --> 25:08.541
Right now, the why isn't
as important as who's next.

25:08.575 --> 25:11.143
Four remaining suspects
in the game,

25:11.177 --> 25:12.812
meaning four more
potential victims.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.681
We have an APB out
on Dr. Emerson.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.949
Danny and Lindsay are
reaching out to her patients,

25:16.983 --> 25:19.652
but Ellen White's the only one
whose name matches

25:19.686 --> 25:21.187
characters from Clue.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.655
TAYLOR:
Lisa Weston did have

25:22.689 --> 25:23.790
scarlet-colored hair.

25:23.823 --> 25:24.991
So, if it's not their name,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.760
it's something specific to them
that connects to the game.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.662
I'm guessing that pattern's
going to follow.

25:29.696 --> 25:32.198
To catch our killer,
we're going to have to play

25:32.231 --> 25:33.666
the game with them.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.934
So, according
to the rules,

25:34.967 --> 25:36.335
Scarlet always moves first,

25:36.368 --> 25:39.171
followed clockwise
by Colonel Mustard,

25:39.205 --> 25:40.840
then White and so on.

25:40.873 --> 25:41.908
HAWKES:
Well, if our killer

25:41.941 --> 25:43.109
is following the order

25:43.142 --> 25:44.811
of players in the game,

25:44.844 --> 25:46.078
what happened to Mustard?

25:46.112 --> 25:47.780
DANVILLE:
Maybe the rules
don't matter.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.081
Locations haven't been spot-on.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.583
Or there's a
body out there

25:50.617 --> 25:51.818
that we don't know about.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.186
I'll check the
missing persons reports

25:54.220 --> 25:57.690
as well as the morgues
for any unidentified DOAs.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.860
Scarlet, Mustard, White.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.294
If the killings
are going in order,

26:02.328 --> 26:03.730
Mr. Green would be next.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.031
Maybe we need to be

26:05.064 --> 26:07.066
focusing on her male patients.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.101
(phone ringing)

26:10.302 --> 26:12.071
Mac Taylor.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.649
(camera shutter clicking)

26:44.671 --> 26:46.405
Vic's name is Shane Simmons.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.406
He's 19.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.809
He was a patient
of Dr. Emerson's for two years.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.678
He had a full ride to Stanford

26:51.711 --> 26:53.212
on a golf scholarship,
but he never went.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.348
Doc's files said it was
too much pressure for him.

26:58.317 --> 27:01.420
Body's on a green,
killed with a candlestick.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.856
Yeah, I was trying to figure
that out-- what's the location?

27:07.794 --> 27:09.662
The ballroom.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.633
Well, I'll give the doctor
this-- she's clever.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.983
Thanks.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.922
We got a pretty lengthy
blood trail.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.324
He was attacked somewhere
else and dragged here.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.993
Employee found a set of keys
still in the door handle,

27:41.027 --> 27:42.261
and the door was unlocked.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.796
Our vic was probably attacked

27:43.830 --> 27:45.898
when he came out
to lock up last night.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.166
TAYLOR:
And the laceration
from the candlestick

27:47.199 --> 27:48.467
is on the back of his head,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.336
so he was hit from behind.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.004
Kid never saw it coming.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.940
What'd you find out?
Simmons been
working here

27:53.973 --> 27:54.874
for about six months.

27:54.907 --> 27:55.875
He takes classes at Hunter
during the day

27:55.908 --> 27:57.977
and comes here at night
to work the late shift.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.445
What time does the place close?

27:59.478 --> 28:01.347
10:00, but
whoever locks up

28:01.380 --> 28:02.348
has to stay here long enough

28:02.381 --> 28:04.116
to get the course ready
for the next morning.

28:04.150 --> 28:07.119
Emerson might have known
his routine,

28:07.153 --> 28:08.821
that he'd be alone.
No witnesses.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.122
Just like the other vics.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.490
Except it's not like
the other two vics.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.225
How do you mean?
Our vic's a male.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.493
Now, we all like Emerson
for this,

28:14.526 --> 28:15.962
and I buy her taking a shot

28:15.995 --> 28:18.264
at Scarlet and hanging White,
but I don't know

28:18.297 --> 28:20.800
many women her size
who could drag a dude his size

28:20.833 --> 28:22.068
from where he was attacked

28:22.101 --> 28:24.336
all the way across this course
to that green over there.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.406
She may have had
someone helping her.

28:28.808 --> 28:32.111
* You keep talking
that same, same song *

28:32.144 --> 28:36.382
* But love lost
make it hard to get along *

28:36.415 --> 28:39.251
* I get it, if it's wrong,
then it's wrong *

28:39.285 --> 28:44.156
* But you're talking about
all kinds of something, so *

28:44.190 --> 28:47.259
* Got nothing to say

28:47.293 --> 28:49.195
* Don't say nothing

28:49.228 --> 28:51.931
* You got nothing to give

28:51.964 --> 28:54.000
* Don't say nothing

28:54.033 --> 28:56.002
* You got something to bring

28:56.035 --> 28:57.469
* Show me something

28:57.503 --> 29:00.272
* You got nothing to say

29:00.306 --> 29:02.074
* Don't say nothing...

29:08.547 --> 29:09.949
DANNY:
Seriously, babe, how long

29:09.982 --> 29:11.117
you planning on wearing
those sunglasses?

29:11.150 --> 29:14.821
Till I don't look like I'm
a member of the Blue Man Group.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.189
Did you figure out what made
those markings in Ballistics?

29:17.223 --> 29:19.792
Yeah. As a matter
of fact, I did.

29:39.245 --> 29:42.882
So, whoever stained
the microscope is a detective.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.416
Ah. Hmm.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.186
Adam and Hawkes don't
have detective shields.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.355
Probably could take Mac
out of the equation

29:49.388 --> 29:51.190
because, you know,
joke is not really

29:51.223 --> 29:52.258
a part of his
vocabulary.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.894
You know, that just leaves
you with Ms. Danville.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.195
And you.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.364
Me? Think I would pull
that kind of prank

29:58.397 --> 29:59.598
on... on my own wife?

29:59.631 --> 30:02.134
Let me see your badge.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.003
You want to see my badge?
Yeah, let me see your badge.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.304
What do you want to
see my badge for?

30:05.337 --> 30:07.907
Let me see it.
Give it to me.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.848
All right, no stain.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.216
I'm looking for a blue stain.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.085
Ah. I'm innocent.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.319
You could have rubbed it off.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.392
(gasps) Oh, my God.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.495
Lucy is going to be so jealous.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.864
How does a whisker
from a giant snow leopard

30:31.898 --> 30:33.165
in the Central Park Zoo

30:33.199 --> 30:36.335
end up on a dead body
halfway across town?

30:37.937 --> 30:39.972
I'm the primary zookeeper
for the snow leopards.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.974
So, does anyone else
interact with them?

30:42.008 --> 30:43.509
They can be
temperamental animals.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.644
Anybody gets in that cage
without proper training,

30:45.677 --> 30:47.980
that's when limbs start
getting ripped off.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.882
You recognize this guy?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.484
No.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.421
What about her?

30:55.454 --> 30:57.256
Doesn't look familiar.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.325
What is this all about?
We found a whisker

30:59.358 --> 31:01.160
from one of your,
uh, snow leopards

31:01.193 --> 31:02.428
at a murder scene this morning.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.097
You think one of my cats
killed someone?

31:05.131 --> 31:06.265
Mr. Hull, where were you
last night?

31:06.298 --> 31:08.000
Me? I was here
most of the night.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.002
I've been staying late.
One of my leopards is sick.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.104
What time, uh, did you leave?

31:12.138 --> 31:13.172
About 10:00.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.974
Drove home,
got a few hours of sleep

31:15.007 --> 31:17.676
and came back at 4:00.
Stop anywhere
along the way?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.111
No. Why are you asking me this?

31:19.145 --> 31:20.679
Do you mind if we
take a look at your car?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.148
I don't have it anymore.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.116
I mean... (chuckles)

31:24.150 --> 31:25.417
I know that sounds suspicious.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.019
I rented it.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.155
It's a Go Ride.
I pick it up when I need it,

31:29.188 --> 31:30.689
and I drop it off
when I'm done.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.258
What time did you drop it off?

31:32.291 --> 31:33.359
Uh, 10:15.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.427
I don't know.
Check with the company.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.462
They keep records.
LINDSAY:
Thanks.

31:36.495 --> 31:39.065
Somebody could have
driven the car after him.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.572
His name's Steve Davis.
He's been a patient

31:46.605 --> 31:49.041
of Dr. Emerson's since
he was 13 years old.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.209
What was he seeing her for?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.577
OCD and depression.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.313
So we subpoenaed
Emerson's case files.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.547
According to Davis's file,

31:55.581 --> 31:57.249
she stopped treating him
two months ago.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.450
What ended the relationship?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.052
DANNY: Kid fell
in love with her.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.653
Right, so she referred him
to another colleague,

32:01.687 --> 32:03.489
but he never made
an appointment.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.324
Says here he was taking
escitalopram

32:05.357 --> 32:06.558
for the last six years.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.027
DANNY: Yeah, but
not currently.

32:08.060 --> 32:08.894
Insurance company says
that he hasn't

32:08.927 --> 32:10.229
filled that prescription
in two months.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.498
So he's off his meds.

32:12.531 --> 32:16.135
Turns out Davis rented the car
from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.

32:26.178 --> 32:30.582
GPS coordinates put the car
at Pier 25 from 11:30 to 12:45,

32:30.616 --> 32:32.018
right around the time
our vic was killed.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.053
And when we tracked down
the Go Ride...

32:40.226 --> 32:41.693
...blood was a match
to our victim,

32:41.727 --> 32:43.429
Shane Simmons--

32:43.462 --> 32:45.297
Mr. Green, killed
with the candlestick.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.735
Steve Davis!

32:49.768 --> 32:51.670
NYPD! Open up!

32:51.703 --> 32:53.039
All right.

33:00.279 --> 33:03.015
(muffled grunting)

33:03.049 --> 33:04.416
We got a live one in here!

33:20.666 --> 33:22.101
TAYLOR:
Where's Davis now?

33:22.134 --> 33:23.102
I don't know.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.236
DANVILLE:
Did he say anything?

33:24.270 --> 33:26.172
Indicate who his
next target may be?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.374
He was over by the board,
he rolled the dice,

33:28.407 --> 33:30.209
he said he had
to finish the game.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.810
Mac, Jo, you guys
need to check this out.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.413
The first three murders
are laid out on this board.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.748
White with the rope
in the conservatory,

33:36.782 --> 33:39.451
Scarlet with the revolver
in the kitchen,

33:39.485 --> 33:41.253
and Green with the candlestick
in the ballroom.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.389
DANVILLE: There's a knife
in the library, but no token.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.556
He's going after Plum.

33:45.657 --> 33:50.096
The dice is rolled to five,
you move Plum's piece...

33:50.129 --> 33:51.130
Goes right into the library.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.664
Between the
public libraries,

33:52.698 --> 33:54.500
the schools and the loony-tune
imagination this guy has,

33:54.533 --> 33:56.268
how the hell are we supposed
to know who's next?

33:56.302 --> 33:57.269
This might help.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.204
Looks like Davis was keeping

33:58.237 --> 34:00.206
a detailed schedule
on all his victims.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.707
There one for Plum?

34:03.575 --> 34:05.511
It reads like
a class schedule.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.778
American Revolution, 10:00 a.m.;

34:06.812 --> 34:08.647
Spanish-American War,
12:00 p.m.;

34:08.679 --> 34:11.117
and another American Revolution
at 4:00 p.m.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.418
Students don't repeat classes
in the same day.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.820
They don't, but professors do.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.123
Plum could be
a real professor.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.425
Clayton!
My fiancÃ©'s a professor

34:19.458 --> 34:20.692
at Chelsea University.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.726
That's his schedule.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.699
Jo and I will take the front.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.202
We'll start in the
back, sweep forward.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.334
Come on.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.107
(gasping softly)

35:14.613 --> 35:16.182
All right, go.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.849
Let's go.

35:19.751 --> 35:20.719
Let me see your hands!

35:20.752 --> 35:21.887
Stand up!

35:21.920 --> 35:23.689
Turn around.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.257
Get out of here.
Go, go.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.196
Building's clear.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.230
No sign of
either of them.

35:31.263 --> 35:34.700
I just got off the phone
with the professor's T.A.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.735
Has not seen or
heard from him

35:36.768 --> 35:37.836
since his last class ended.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.205
That was 45
minutes ago.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.472
Maybe he took him
off campus.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.340
I don't think so.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.541
We know Davis
followed his victims,

35:42.574 --> 35:44.810
kept tabs on
their schedule--

35:44.843 --> 35:47.246
Scarlet in her neighborhood,
White at dance, Green at work.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.347
So it makes sense
that they'd still be here.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.548
Then what are we missing?

35:53.919 --> 35:57.923
TAYLOR: "Hastings Library,
opened March 21, 1963."

35:57.956 --> 36:01.193
But Chelsea University was
founded in the late 1800s.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.695
This wasn't
the first library.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.569
Pull up the original map
of the university.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.808
Got it.
We're looking for the location
of the library.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.677
Looks like it used to be on
the south side of the campus.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.279
ROSS:
Which is now
a science building--

36:20.312 --> 36:21.447
Lawrence Hall.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.454
TAYLOR:
Drop the knife, Davis!

36:34.560 --> 36:36.928
Need a medic at Lawrence Hall
right away.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.436
Okay, give me your hand.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.737
Right here.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.875
Police! Look out!

36:53.479 --> 36:55.681
FLACK:
Mac Taylor in the lounge

36:55.714 --> 36:57.583
with the Glock.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.286
You just couldn't help yourself,
could you?

37:00.319 --> 37:01.920
(handcuffs clicking)

37:13.832 --> 37:16.335
I-I-I need to see

37:16.368 --> 37:18.270
Dr. Emerson.
Oh, you will,

37:18.304 --> 37:19.905
in court
behind a stand

37:19.938 --> 37:21.740
as she's testifying
against you

37:21.773 --> 37:23.008
for murdering three
of her patients

37:23.041 --> 37:24.910
and nearly killing her fiancÃ©.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.347
He's alive?

37:28.380 --> 37:30.416
Luckily.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.621
You were in love with her.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.490
That's why you
went after him.

37:38.524 --> 37:40.426
That's why she stopped
seeing you.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.496
Did you get my letters?

37:44.530 --> 37:46.532
EMERSON:
I'm afraid that's what
we need to talk about.

37:46.565 --> 37:50.068
I-I meant every word of it.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.405
Okay, I'm-I'm not going
to deny my feelings anymore.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.908
I love you.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.879
I think you're confusing
your feelings for me.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.013
No.

38:02.047 --> 38:05.016
I've never been
more sure of anything.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.619
My whole life,

38:07.653 --> 38:10.922
you're the only one who has
ever given a damn about me.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.659
You know that's not true;
your parents love you.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.027
No, they don't...
they don't love me.

38:16.061 --> 38:19.598
My mother loves
her vacation home,

38:19.631 --> 38:21.533
and my father loves
his French whores.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.669
They don't...
they don't love me.

38:23.702 --> 38:27.539
Steve, I need you to understand,

38:27.573 --> 38:29.975
I don't have
the same feelings for you.

38:30.008 --> 38:33.712
I care for you, but as I
do for all my patients,

38:33.745 --> 38:36.482
which is quite a great deal.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.556
And you have a boyfriend.

38:44.590 --> 38:47.459
Yes, and I know
that one day

38:47.493 --> 38:50.629
you'll find someone who
loves you like you deserve.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.565
DAVIS:
No, no, she...

38:53.599 --> 38:55.867
she turned her back on me,
is what she did.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.869
Just like
my parents,

38:57.903 --> 38:59.538
first sign of trouble
and she just

38:59.571 --> 39:02.708
tossed me aside to become
some other doctor's problem.

39:02.741 --> 39:06.445
And Clue-- how'd that figure in?

39:06.478 --> 39:09.615
EMERSON:
I thought you might like
to play a game.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.017
Have a little fun while we get
to know one another,

39:12.050 --> 39:14.019
break the ice.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.488
You can choose
whichever game you like.

39:27.499 --> 39:31.169
She was Mrs. Peacock...

39:31.202 --> 39:33.472
and I was Colonel Mustard.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.873
FLACK:
What about her patients?

39:34.906 --> 39:37.142
How'd you go about
choosing them?

39:38.944 --> 39:43.048
I broke into her office
and I went through her files.

39:47.653 --> 39:53.459
I picked
three perfect patients,

39:53.492 --> 39:57.729
I followed them, I...
I learned their schedule.

40:23.221 --> 40:28.159
I wanted to hurt her
the way that she hurt me--

40:28.193 --> 40:30.496
by taking away the things

40:30.529 --> 40:33.231
that she loved most,

40:33.264 --> 40:35.701
but more than anything...

40:38.003 --> 40:42.941
...I wanted her to know
that it was me doing it.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.085
(bell dings)

40:54.119 --> 40:56.087
Hey.
Hey.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.188
What-- are you
getting off?

40:57.222 --> 40:58.156
You getting on?

40:58.189 --> 41:00.559
You got some hot date
I don't know about?

41:00.592 --> 41:02.528
Yeah, taking my wife out
to dinner tonight.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.029
Oh, what's
the occasion?

41:04.062 --> 41:05.163
You don't need
an occasion

41:05.196 --> 41:07.633
to take your wife out
to dinner, do you?

41:10.902 --> 41:12.871
It was you.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.707
I knew it.
(laughing)

41:15.741 --> 41:17.609
I said it was you.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.177
Adam was supposed to be

41:19.210 --> 41:20.579
in Ballistics,
not you, and...

41:20.612 --> 41:21.580
Well, why didn't

41:21.613 --> 41:23.081
you just tell me?
I don't know.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.049
I was going to tell you.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.017
We were at the zoo,
and you seemed so pissed,

41:26.051 --> 41:27.719
and we had
to catch the killer,

41:27.753 --> 41:29.220
so I didn't.

41:30.255 --> 41:33.525
So it was Messer in Ballistics.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.861
With methylene blue.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.830
Can you forgive me?

41:38.864 --> 41:41.099
(sighs)

41:44.102 --> 41:45.771
It's almost gone.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.106
This better be
some dinner.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.993
Hey, I thought we were meeting
at your place.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.864
I have something I
need to say to you,

42:12.898 --> 42:14.900
and I didn't
want it to wait.

42:19.337 --> 42:22.908
I love you, Christine.

42:25.911 --> 42:27.646
Aren't you going to...?
