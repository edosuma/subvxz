'The commonwealth
calls Lesll Stone.‘

00:05.400 --> 00:07.038
(Lesli)
'Even though Alison
was already locked up'

00:07.070 --> 00:08.298
her friends were all on edge

00:08.340 --> 00:10.661
about anyone
asking any questions.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.099
(Spencer)
Do you remember everything
that Charles made you do?

00:13.140 --> 00:15.131
- Yeah, don't you?
- No, not really.

00:15.180 --> 00:17.705
He never loved Radley. He killed
himself when he was 16.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.513
_ Your _brother_
might still be alive.

00:19.550 --> 00:20.642
We go to Radley.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.181
I can't believe you went home.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.517
I thought maybe once
my mom got over

00:23.550 --> 00:25.689
the shock of me being back,
things would be different.

00:25.720 --> 00:26.709
- Were they?
- No.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.318
This is Dean Stavros.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.521
Spencer, I'm a drug
and alcohol abuse counselor.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.790
Help! Help!

00:32.830 --> 00:35.048
I just needed to get some air
and the door wouldn't open.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.260
I'm Clark.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.665
Maybe you could
sell me something

00:37.700 --> 00:39.190
that would help calm my nerves.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.730
- Yeah, what?
- Pot.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.408
Sabrina made me some cookies.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.601
Whatever is bothering you,
is still going to be there.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.801
(Spencer)
I can't sleep.
My mind won't shut off.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.501
I just want to quiet the noise.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.213
[water dripping]

01:20.780 --> 01:22.338
[pounding]

01:24.410 --> 01:25.377
Hello?

01:26.480 --> 01:27.469
Hello?

01:28.620 --> 01:30.212
[squeaking]

01:33.760 --> 01:35.455
Wait, wait!

01:35.490 --> 01:37.219
Who are you?

01:43.230 --> 01:46.358
[eerie music]

01:54.680 --> 01:56.409

* Got a secret

03:42.520 --> 03:43.589
* Can you keep it?

03:43.620 --> 03:46.453
* Swear this one you'll save

03:46.490 --> 03:48.583
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:48.620 --> 03:51.453
* Taking this one to the grave

03:51.490 --> 03:53.594
* If I show you
that I know you *

03:53.630 --> 03:56.463
* Won't tell what I said

03:56.500 --> 03:58.627
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

03:58.670 --> 04:01.389

'Hold it. Go back.‘

04:05.540 --> 04:06.472
'Did you see his face
in the dream?‘

04:06.510 --> 04:07.738
The word is nightmare.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.475
And no, I didn't,
that's when I fell off the bed.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.478
- So who was the little girl?
- I don't know.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.273
I've never seen her before.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.617
Or maybe I have.

04:14.650 --> 04:16.880
'Well, again, Spencer,
it was just a dream.‘

04:16.920 --> 04:18.342
Or nightmare.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.687
'Well, what about
that creepy room?‘

04:19.720 --> 04:21.017
'I mean, do you remember
ever seeing it--'

04:21.060 --> 04:23.278
I don't know, and ifI did

04:23.330 --> 04:26.629
I've completely burned it
from my brain.

04:26.660 --> 04:28.355
- Listen, I should go.
- 'Wait, wait.‘

04:28.400 --> 04:30.027
When we went back inside
after A locked us out

04:30.070 --> 04:31.697
do you remember a tiled room?

04:31.730 --> 04:34.961
- 'It was right next to the--'
- Spencer, I do not wanna--

04:35.000 --> 04:36.831
Aria, please, just help me.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.508
I can't. Seriously.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.907
It-it is taking all that I
have to forget that place.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.579
'It is bad enough I can't even
walk by the photo lab--'

04:44.610 --> 04:46.510
What did you do
with that hair dye?

04:46.550 --> 04:48.313
Huh, you're giving me cramps.

04:48.350 --> 04:51.046
Aria, we can't just
throw away clues.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.411
What're you eating?

04:55.560 --> 04:57.528
Hello? Spencer, are you there?

04:57.560 --> 04:59.391
Yeah. I'm still here.

04:59.430 --> 05:01.648
My mother's just
sitting on my chest.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.669
She's still on my case about
this stupid valedictorian thing.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.860
Well, why don't you
just say yes?

05:05.900 --> 05:07.936
Because it's a pity toss,
that's why.

05:07.970 --> 05:09.460
I've been gone for over a month.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.966
She probably offered
to buy them a planetarium.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.671
'Just do it.'

05:12.710 --> 05:14.803
Please, just give me a friggin'
reason to go to graduation.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.070
Oh, really? Now you
wanna go to graduation?

05:17.110 --> 05:18.543
I thought your dad excused you

05:18.580 --> 05:21.014
from ever having to step
foot in school again.

05:21.050 --> 05:23.587
- Oh, God. I have to run.
- 'What just happened?‘

05:23.620 --> 05:24.882
My mom just back from Curves

05:24.920 --> 05:26.558
and I'm not having
this argument with her

05:26.590 --> 05:27.557
after she pumped iron.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.649
I'll call you later, okay? Bye.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.098
[965%]
God! Mona.

05:35.130 --> 05:37.462
Is this a bad time?

05:38.470 --> 05:40.438
When did you get back?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.028
Late last night.

05:42.070 --> 05:44.834
I just saw your mom
as she was leaving for work.

05:44.870 --> 05:47.998
She introduced me
to that cop parked at your curb.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.476
What's with the shades?

05:51.510 --> 05:54.115
- Is that cop really here 24/7?
- Yup.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.139
And there's a bunch

05:55.180 --> 05:56.613
at school too.

05:56.650 --> 05:57.878
They stand outside the bathroom

05:57.920 --> 05:59.785
while you pee.

05:59.820 --> 06:02.118
I wish we'd never
come back here.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.980
Well, did you feel any safer
at the spa?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.590
Safer than I feel being
in the same zip code as Alison.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.052
- Mona!
- I sent her to jail, Hanna.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.124
For months.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.161
There's no way she's not

06:10.200 --> 06:12.122
plotting some kind of revenge.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.035
That's what you're
worried about?

06:14.070 --> 06:15.594
'A is still out there.‘

06:15.640 --> 06:17.608
You've got bigger
worries than Alison.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.870
Yeah, I know,
and when I leave here

06:19.910 --> 06:22.606
I have to go straight
to the police station.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.799
They might still press
charges against me

06:23.850 --> 06:25.875
for being dead
when I wasn't.

06:25.910 --> 06:27.741
Well, that's not a crime,
that's just being stupid.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.884
No, Han, when there's
a full-on investigation

06:29.920 --> 06:32.184
that costs the taxpayers
more than our new sewer system

06:32.220 --> 06:33.619
it's a crime.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.888
And I don't think
I'll have any cops

06:34.920 --> 06:36.057
looking out for me.

06:36.090 --> 06:38.957
They're looking for A!
We all are.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.151
Even more reason
for Alison to wanna hurt me.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.168
Forget Alison.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.827
We have to track down anyone

06:44.870 --> 06:47.668
who ever had any contact
with Charles DiLaurentis.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.032
Someone who worked at Radley
has got to know something!

06:50.070 --> 06:53.039
- I'm betting their father.
- He's no help.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.570
Alison is so embarrassed

06:54.610 --> 06:57.170
she only leaves her house
nowadays to go to church.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.849
Church? Alison?

06:59.880 --> 07:01.518
Don't get all judge-y.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.984
She's just trying to move on.
We all are.

07:05.950 --> 07:07.815
[sighs]

07:09.590 --> 07:11.057
Well, will you
at least drop me off

07:11.090 --> 07:12.227
at the precinct before school?

07:12.260 --> 07:14.922
I can't go in there alone.

07:14.960 --> 07:15.892
Please?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.801
(male #2)
'Yeah. No, my shift
started at 10:00.‘

07:24.840 --> 07:27.070
(male #3)
'She hasn't left the house
since yesterday..'

07:27.110 --> 07:28.202
'...unless she dug a tunnel.‘

07:28.240 --> 07:29.798
[men chuckling]

07:29.850 --> 07:31.101
(male #2)
'Yeah, you know,
with this little skank'

07:31.150 --> 07:32.811
'I wouldn't be
surprised, right?‘

07:32.850 --> 07:34.078
(male #3)
'Who's protecting us from her?‘

07:34.120 --> 07:35.940
(male #2)
'Yeah, seriously.‘

07:35.980 --> 07:37.743
(male #3)
'I mean, how many people
has she put behind bars?'

07:37.790 --> 07:39.087
'I think they should
chain her to the bed.'

07:39.120 --> 07:40.815
- 'Right.‘
- 'Yeah.'

07:40.860 --> 07:43.078
(male #3)
'So are you running
second shift tomorrow?‘

07:43.130 --> 07:44.222
(male #2)
'I think so.‘

07:44.260 --> 07:45.682
(male #3)
Alright, well, see you then.

07:45.730 --> 07:46.992
[indistinct chatter]

07:48.760 --> 07:52.969
Mom, I-I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.800
Yes, you are.
You're slurring your words.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.874
I'll call you later.

08:03.780 --> 08:06.248
Hey, what do you say
we go to the movies tonight?

08:06.280 --> 08:07.645
If my mom comes with us.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.580
Emily, I've gotta go home.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.247
Why? I thought
you said your mom--

08:11.290 --> 08:13.884
I did. But now
she wants me back.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.658
Does she think that
she can make some money

08:16.690 --> 08:17.850
off of what happened to you?

08:17.890 --> 08:19.187
Probably.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.027
But I have to deal with her.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.864
Or you could stop dealing
with her all together.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.835
Have you ever thought about
getting legally emancipated?

08:33.840 --> 08:35.603
[knock on door]

08:35.640 --> 08:37.744
- Hey.
- 'Hey!'

08:37.780 --> 08:40.010
- How did you know--
- I'm a psychic.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.745
That or you told me
you'd be working

08:41.780 --> 08:43.145
in your dad's office today.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.886
Oh, right. What's up?

08:45.920 --> 08:47.751
Well, I was looking over
yesterday's photos

08:47.790 --> 08:49.155
and I need to re-think
what I'm shooting.

08:49.190 --> 08:50.657
Why?

08:50.690 --> 08:52.055
I mean my portfolio's
starting to look like

08:52.090 --> 08:55.890
one of those calendars
the bank hands out for free.

08:55.930 --> 08:59.195
I was thinking of taking a ride
out to a junkyard on Route 47.

08:59.230 --> 09:00.959
Wanna come?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.639
Uh...no, no, I shouldn't.

09:03.670 --> 09:06.639
I should stay here.
I have a lotta work to do.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.649
Well, don't go into
an early retirement, girl.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.204
I wasn't blowing smoke.
Your stuff is good.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.048
It's exactly the type of work
they're looking for.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.775
Who's looking for?

09:15.820 --> 09:18.084
Didn't we talk
about the contest?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.315
Mm, no.
What-what contest?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.726
The Cardillo Fellowship,
it's a cash prize

09:22.760 --> 09:24.921
and a summer internship
at a magazine.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.655
- Where?
- In LA.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.053
Yeah, I know it ain't Rosewood

09:28.100 --> 09:30.864
but there are things worth
photographing there too.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.130
And you can do it
in flip-flops.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.009
Good luck with your work.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.209
Um, Clark?

09:41.010 --> 09:43.706
Can we just stop by my house,
I need to grab my camera.

09:45.110 --> 09:46.099
Yeah.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.588
Why are you out here?

09:55.420 --> 09:57.285
I just needed some air.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.629
If you're going stir-crazy you
can come with me to the office.

10:00.660 --> 10:01.820
Do your homework
in the conference room

10:01.860 --> 10:03.020
no one will bother you.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.265
I'm fine here.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.962
I can always wear earplugs.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.264
I overheard
one of Rosewood's finest

10:10.310 --> 10:12.608
dissing me to another cop.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.372
Well, well..

10:14.410 --> 10:15.707
Well, what?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.105
I'd let it go.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.845
Kinda hard when someone's
kicked you in the teeth

10:18.880 --> 10:20.142
before you've even brushed them.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.171
Alison, you have to own it.

10:22.220 --> 10:25.246
Bad behavior has a way
of catching up with you.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.951
You would know.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.791
* She's got style
she's got grace *

10:39.840 --> 10:41.262
* An appetite for expensive..

10:41.300 --> 10:43.006
Do you want a latte?

10:43.040 --> 10:46.771
I don't care, just order. Hurry.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.903
I thought you weren't
in a rush to go to the police.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.179
(Lesli)
'Mona?‘

10:52.380 --> 10:55.417
Lesli? Oh, my God.

10:55.450 --> 10:56.781
What are you doing in Rosewood?

10:56.820 --> 10:58.811
- I was summoned by the police.
- What? Why?

10:58.850 --> 11:01.887
What do you mean, why? You made
me an accomplice to a crime.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.024
- But you didn't do anything.
- Yes, I did.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.028
I made the mistake
of complementing a stranger

11:06.060 --> 11:07.755
on her Dolce & Gabbana
stretch pants.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.961
'And now, everything
that I have worked for'

11:10.000 --> 11:12.889
my fellowship, my teaching
position, my reputation

11:12.940 --> 11:14.168
they're all in jeopardy

11:14.200 --> 11:15.963
'because I actually saw you
as the victim.‘

11:16.000 --> 11:17.809
You, you conniving little bitch!

11:17.840 --> 11:19.899
Whoa, easy.
This is her first day home.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.703
Sorry, I forgot the champagne.

11:21.740 --> 11:22.946
Get a grip, Lesli.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.447
Mona never made up
that plan to hurt you.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.313
Really? You think I actually
wanted perjury on my resume?

11:27.350 --> 11:29.079
I don't know what that means but
I really don't like your tone.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.042
Who gives a crap what you like,
you bag of hair.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.318
Guys, stop.

11:32.350 --> 11:35.353
Lesli, I'm sorry about
all this, I swear.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.789
- I'll call you later--
- Don't.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.252
If you ever try
to reach out to me

11:38.290 --> 11:40.850
or you mention my name
to anyone ever again

11:40.900 --> 11:42.788
'and you will live
to regret it.'

11:42.830 --> 11:44.798
I believe in payback too.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.991
* Put your hands up

11:47.040 --> 11:49.907
* Time for your ace
in the hole **

11:52.980 --> 11:54.072
I mean, she acts like being
questioned by the police

11:54.110 --> 11:55.475
is the same thing
Mona's been through.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.842
And then she turns it on me. Me.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.747
I'm like, "Hello! I should be
biting your head off, freak.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.214
You're the one who testified
against me." Am I wrong?

12:03.250 --> 12:06.083
Okay, unless you're texting
me the answer, you're rude.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.954
Wha.. I'm sorry, um...Toby's
not back 'til Monday.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.083
That's a really
long time to wait.

12:12.130 --> 12:14.826
Wait for what?

12:14.860 --> 12:15.952
Eww, why would you say that?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.163
I didn't say anything,
I just smiled.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.135
Well, your cup may runneth over,
but mine is bone dry.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.365
Eww, why?
Did you and Caleb have a fight?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.105
No, we don't even fight anymore.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.778
He treats me like
some cracked egg

12:27.810 --> 12:28.902
that fell out
of a robin's nest.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.044
[cellphone beeping]

12:33.150 --> 12:35.175
- Who's that?
- Mona.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.381
She's scared of Alison
and Lesli Stone now.

12:37.420 --> 12:38.785
Uh, just stay out of it.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.856
Hell no,
Lesli is a freaking lunatic

12:40.890 --> 12:42.517
_who needs
a serious reality check.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.188
Mona was locked in a hole by
someone who is still out there.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.993
Her friend should forgive her.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.395
That's not staying out of it.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.523
Spencer, we can't have Mona
quaking in her boots

12:50.570 --> 12:53.164
when we need that boot to kick
the doors down at Radley.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.895
I mean, I'm not going back
to that shredding place

12:54.940 --> 12:57.204
and Mona knows Radley
more than any of us.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.879
Does she have any idea who could
be posing as Ali's dead brother?

12:59.910 --> 13:01.400
Don't say dead.

13:01.440 --> 13:06.275
Charles isn't dead dead until
we find something to prove it.

13:06.310 --> 13:07.868
- Uh.
- Ow.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.410
What is wrong with you?

13:09.450 --> 13:12.010
It's not your cookie.

13:12.050 --> 13:14.416
Okay, first you're sexting Toby
like some dog in heat

13:14.460 --> 13:17.224
and then you're gumming
at your dessert like my grandma.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.023
How long do you want
that cookie to last?

13:19.060 --> 13:20.357
We're not talking
about me, okay?

13:20.400 --> 13:23.028
The subject is Charles,
and it's not gonna be easy

13:23.070 --> 13:25.129
breaking into Radley
with or without Mona.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.564
Are you buzzed?

13:28.600 --> 13:31.068
What? No, Hanna, focus.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.304
You have the same look
in your eyes

13:32.340 --> 13:33.978
as this girl
in my government class

13:34.010 --> 13:35.978
who hums and makes chokers
out of paper clips.

13:36.010 --> 13:39.241
I'm not humming, I'm just..
I'm missing Toby.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.847
Well, Dr. Oz says sex
is a drug too, Spencer.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.983
Maybe you should
figure that one out.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.597
I like.
Are, uh, dolls your thing?

13:58.630 --> 14:01.337
No. Actually, I find them
pretty creepy

14:01.370 --> 14:04.407
but, um...it's this
new thing I'm trying.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.930
Embracing the creepy.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.471
Oh, I get it.

14:07.510 --> 14:10.377
I, um, did this project last
year, where I took vegetables

14:10.410 --> 14:12.878
and did a photo progression
as they rotted.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.138
That sounds pretty cool.
How'd it turn out?

14:15.180 --> 14:17.978
I had a smelly apartment
and a major fruit-fly problem

14:18.020 --> 14:20.159
but other than that it was okay.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.898
What are you doing?

14:28.930 --> 14:31.398
Sorry, uh, the shadow
was across your face

14:31.430 --> 14:34.160
and I just couldn't help myself.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.967
In honor of us diving into
things that scare us..

14:39.010 --> 14:41.570
...would you be up to having
dinner with me tonight?

14:41.610 --> 14:45.171
Uh...C|ark, uh..

14:45.210 --> 14:49.044
...that's a really
nice offer, but I can't.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.118
I'm just.. I'm not dating.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.311
At least not for a while.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.419
This past year
has been really difficult

14:56.460 --> 14:59.588
and without having...to go
into all the details--

14:59.630 --> 15:01.291
No, I know.

15:01.330 --> 15:05.266
I-I recognized you.
From the news.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.165
'I didn't wanna bring it up
when we first met.‘

15:07.200 --> 15:10.658
I figured it's probably
hard enough for you.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.031
I didn't wanna make you
feel self-conscious.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.147
I apologize.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.239
You don't have to.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.285
What do you mean?

15:27.320 --> 15:30.619
Uh, there's bike rides
and lake activities

15:30.660 --> 15:33.151
I mean there's even
an overnight.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.724
You're not scared
of being in the woods

15:34.760 --> 15:36.159
after sundown, are you?

15:36.200 --> 15:39.021
No, I have been in the woods.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.332
I just don't think
I'm gonna be going back

15:40.370 --> 15:41.689
without a police escort.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.230
They're watching me
all the time.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.500
They're watching
out for you, Alison.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.008
You're not the person
they're trying to catch.

15:49.610 --> 15:51.100
Look, if you don't wanna do it--

15:51.150 --> 15:54.074
It's not that _I don't want to.
I just..

15:54.120 --> 15:55.576
Do you remember
the church, Ali?

15:55.620 --> 15:59.340
I recommended you for this.
No one gave any pushback.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.211
Seriously?

16:02.260 --> 16:03.386
Well, there were a few people

16:03.430 --> 16:04.658
who didn't say, "Yay",
right away

16:04.690 --> 16:07.352
but I took advantage
of the silence.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.233
I really believe you can make
a difference with these kids.

16:13.770 --> 16:15.089
[door opens]

16:15.800 --> 16:18.132
[door closes]

16:18.170 --> 16:21.207
Hey, dad.
Uh, you remember Lorenzo?

16:21.240 --> 16:23.470
- Hey there.
- Hello.

16:23.510 --> 16:26.206
Is this your idea
of a replacement?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.218
'Thought if you lodged
a complaint about one cop'

16:28.250 --> 16:30.639
you could swap him out for
someone closer to your own age?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.089
That's not what
I told you.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.348
You claimed that cop
insulted you.

16:33.390 --> 16:34.789
- He did.
- Whoa, wait.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.617
- Who did?
- Uh, you can leave now.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.218
- Thank you.
- Why?

16:38.260 --> 16:41.423
The last time I checked,
this was still my house.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.064
Goodbye, Lorenzo.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.008
[door opens]

16:59.410 --> 17:02.117
Okay, do you have anything that
you might wanna put on a resume?

17:02.150 --> 17:05.039
Any small job you had
before, uh..

17:05.090 --> 17:08.253
I mean, I babysat
for my neighbors' kids.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.383
That, uh, that
may not be enough.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.819
Caleb, she was 14
when she ran away from home.

17:12.860 --> 17:14.418
'She's looking to be
emancipated.‘

17:14.460 --> 17:16.451
'No one expects her to have
started a hedge fund.‘

17:16.500 --> 17:18.297
No, but they do expect her
to have a job

17:18.330 --> 17:20.798
where she can support herself
and a high school diploma.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.661
- We should go.
- No, wait.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.530
Caleb, you were able to do this.

17:25.570 --> 17:29.301
Yeah, and that's how I know
it's not an easy process.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.274
Look, if you're only a couple
of months away from turning 18

17:31.310 --> 17:33.278
I would say just go home
and wait it out--

17:33.320 --> 17:35.140
(Emily)
'No, she's not waiting it out.‘

17:35.180 --> 17:38.047
She's lost enough time,
every moment is precious.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.221
[squealing]

17:52.730 --> 17:56.063
[dramatic music]

18:20.230 --> 18:21.857
What just happened?

18:21.900 --> 18:24.289
Nothing. Nothing.
It was my fault.

18:25.630 --> 18:26.619
Okay.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.605
I thought about blowing it off..

18:37.650 --> 18:41.211
'...but there are only so many
family dinners you can skip.‘

18:41.250 --> 18:42.808
'So I went.‘

18:42.850 --> 18:45.683
And the questions started.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.211
'I told everyone I lost my job'

18:48.260 --> 18:50.888
'and I was actively
looking for another.‘

18:50.930 --> 18:54.821
I came so close to raiding
my sister's medicine chest.

18:54.860 --> 18:57.226
'Then I realized..'

18:57.270 --> 18:59.397
...I'd already delivered
the bad news.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.394
Nobody blinked.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.159
'Putting it out there
right away..'

19:05.210 --> 19:07.132
'...it helped.‘

19:10.410 --> 19:12.275
(Dean)
'Uh, I'm Dean
and I'm an addict.‘

19:12.310 --> 19:13.572
(all)
'Hi, Dean.‘

19:13.620 --> 19:16.248
I just got back from
a family event myself.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.282
My older brother's wedding.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.413
I have a lot of the same issues
that Sheldon has.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.655
'Some old grudges
and some new ones.‘

19:22.690 --> 19:25.454
'I could feel everybody
wondering if I was high.‘

19:25.490 --> 19:27.253
Expecting me to be
the same person

19:27.300 --> 19:29.655
that showed up to anything
without a buzz on.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.588
Excuse me.

19:31.630 --> 19:34.190
The refreshments _are for
after the meeting.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.567
Sorry.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.868
Okay, I may have gone
a little overboard.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.673
I've got over eight rolls
in here.

19:45.710 --> 19:48.543
Well, here, I'll help
hang 'em up. Gimme a couple.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.514
Thank you.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.308
Aria.
You wanna wait 'til they dry?

20:14.340 --> 20:16.331
You're making me nervous.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.644
No, they look great.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.318
Where are you goin'?

20:20.350 --> 20:22.409
I just have to make
a quick phone call.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.578
(Emily over phone)
'Aria?‘

20:26.620 --> 20:27.757
Clark may have taken
a picture of A.

20:27.790 --> 20:29.587
Whoa, slow down. Who's Clark?

20:29.620 --> 20:31.588
(Aria)
'The guy that I met
in the Hollis photo lab.'

20:31.630 --> 20:33.450
We-we went to a junkyard
to take some pictures

20:33.500 --> 20:34.990
and I'm pretty sure
that A followed us there.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.622
And Clark got A on camera?

20:36.660 --> 20:38.924
By accident, but I-I can't
examine the negatives

20:38.970 --> 20:40.892
without looking like a freak,
so maybe I should just tell him

20:40.940 --> 20:41.998
what's going on and that way--

20:42.040 --> 20:43.860
No! Don't.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.468
Aria, if you say anything

20:45.510 --> 20:47.273
Sarah's gonna be the one
who gets targeted.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.675
I'm the one
that's being followed.

20:48.710 --> 20:51.372
I left Rosewood for an hour
and A was all over it.

20:51.410 --> 20:52.672
Why don't you just print
the photos out

20:52.710 --> 20:53.745
and we'll look at them.

20:53.780 --> 20:54.747
'They're not mine, Em.'

20:54.780 --> 20:55.747
So, borrow them. Okay?

20:55.780 --> 20:58.749
'Clark's not gonna miss them
for one night.‘

20:58.790 --> 21:00.382
I gotta go.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.357
'E (Caleb)
verything okay?‘

21:06.390 --> 21:08.028
Yeah, it's all good.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.790
Okay. Where were we?

21:10.830 --> 21:14.789
I can't fake havin' a job.
What if they wanna call my boss?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.358
Give them my number.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.934
What are you gonna say?

21:19.970 --> 21:23.371
That she works for me
at my web design company.

21:23.410 --> 21:24.570
You're willing to cover for her?

21:24.610 --> 21:27.670
It's not a cover.
It's minimum wage.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.289
You start tomorrow.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.386
Hey, Lesli, it's Hanna again.

21:37.430 --> 21:40.797
I'm wondering
if you...got my message

21:40.830 --> 21:43.822
or if you just
don't wanna meet, but..

21:45.430 --> 21:46.419
Never mind.

21:46.470 --> 21:49.564
[instrumental music]

21:54.840 --> 21:58.503
Look, before we do this,
can I just say one thing?

22:00.650 --> 22:02.072
Sure.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.542
I'm sorry.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.478
I was way outta line
this morning.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.852
You are not the source
of my anger.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.108
Clearly, you got more screwed
over by that Mona stunt

22:10.160 --> 22:12.958
than I did, and if you found
a way to forgive her--

22:12.990 --> 22:14.457
I have.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.991
And it would be
great if you could too.

22:17.030 --> 22:19.897
That...may not happen overnight.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.569
Mona's complicated. Okay?

22:25.610 --> 22:28.579
But she is not
the real monster here.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.840
That person hasn't
been caught yet.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.370
Maybe you're right..

22:32.410 --> 22:35.914
...but I still can't help
but wonder if that..

22:35.950 --> 22:39.386
...Radley place helped Mona
or made her worse.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.109
What does that mean?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.627
That nut house
may have closed down

22:43.660 --> 22:45.753
but it still holds
all the answers.

22:46.690 --> 22:49.056
Answers to what?

22:49.100 --> 22:52.592
Ithought
the police...ask the questions.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.666
Taking matters into your own
hands is exactly what got

22:54.700 --> 22:57.498
your friend Mona into trouble
in the first place.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.728
Ready to hit the road?

23:01.780 --> 23:04.146
Yup. Actually..

23:04.180 --> 23:05.943
...now I can't remember
ifI dumped out

23:05.980 --> 23:07.641
the last of the solution.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.942
Hang tight, I'll check.

23:08.980 --> 23:10.709
- Okay?
- Alright.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.659
We're all good.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.059
Are you sure you don't
wanna come in?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.499
Mmm, pass.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.893
The last time
I saw that gate

23:28.940 --> 23:31.909
your mother was tossing
my duffle bag through it.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.771
Aiming for my head.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.175
Well, she's mellowed out
a bit since then.

23:35.210 --> 23:36.632
Oh, I doubt it.

23:36.680 --> 23:37.908
Uh, if your family
did mellow

23:37.950 --> 23:39.941
I wouldn't be driving
you home right now.

23:42.580 --> 23:45.219
Look, I haven't been
to a meeting in a while.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.515
And it was just
for some reassurance.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.654
I thought it was the free food.

23:51.690 --> 23:55.057
I'm just really tired of living
in a state of permanent anxiety.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.193
If a few bites of a cookie
can get me through my day

23:57.230 --> 23:58.788
and help me sleep--

23:58.830 --> 24:02.698
It doesn't work like that.
You can't rationalize.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.207
Uh, you're either in
or you're out.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.663
I know, I know.

24:06.710 --> 24:08.132
But when you've been yanked out
of one nightmare

24:08.180 --> 24:09.932
and then shoved into another--

24:09.980 --> 24:12.699
You're right. It sucks.

24:14.980 --> 24:17.141
Yeah, but you're
strong, Spencer..

24:17.180 --> 24:18.613
...stronger than you think.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.982
Please...just don't say that.

24:21.020 --> 24:23.989
Why? Why don't you believe that?

24:30.900 --> 24:33.994
I gave something to you a long
time ago and you never used it.

24:35.770 --> 24:37.738
My number.

24:37.770 --> 24:40.000
Maybe next time
you can't sleep or..

24:40.040 --> 24:41.678
Thank you.

24:51.050 --> 24:52.915
Can you do me a favor?

24:52.950 --> 24:53.917
Yeah.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.024
Can you throw that out?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.069
Wow.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.989
You're the first girl
to toss her cookies in my car.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.894
[laughing]

25:15.040 --> 25:17.031
Thank you.

25:37.260 --> 25:39.569
Mona? Is that you?

25:40.970 --> 25:43.165
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.929
What are you doing?

25:46.140 --> 25:48.176
It's a card for Alison.

25:48.210 --> 25:51.304
I know it's totally retro,
but e-mails can be deleted

25:51.350 --> 25:53.671
and she would never
take my calls, 50..

25:55.080 --> 25:56.718
You look great, Spencer.

25:56.750 --> 25:59.241
Much better than
the last time I saw you.

25:59.290 --> 26:00.951
I was on a hospital gurney.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.084
Yeah, me too, but you looked
more graceful being rolled.

26:07.830 --> 26:10.958
Mona...can I ask you something?

26:12.970 --> 26:15.939
You were in that dollhouse
longer than any of us.

26:15.970 --> 26:17.665
So do you think
that it's possible

26:17.710 --> 26:19.063
or could there be a chance

26:19.110 --> 26:20.805
that there was another girl
that was trapped down there?

26:20.840 --> 26:23.673
Not Sara Harvey,
but a-a younger girl

26:23.710 --> 26:25.200
maybe 11 or 12.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.877
Why are you asking me this?

26:26.910 --> 26:29.947
I-I-I have this image
in my head of a young girl.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.210
She looks a lot like
a young Alison and she's..

26:32.250 --> 26:33.615
...guiding me towards
this creepy room

26:33.660 --> 26:35.753
with these rusted bathtubs.

26:35.790 --> 26:37.018
I think that everyone
that was trapped

26:37.060 --> 26:38.823
in that place escaped,
Spencen

26:38.860 --> 26:40.953
Okay, but what about that room?
Have you ever seen it?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.888
It's got a couple of drains
on the floor

26:42.930 --> 26:45.091
and the walls are tiled, there's
broken furniture everywhere

26:45.130 --> 26:47.837
and God knows what horrible
things happened down there.

26:47.870 --> 26:50.737
No. I haven't seen it, but..

26:52.040 --> 26:53.029
...it sounds terrifying.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.731
It is.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.699
Maybe it doesn't exist.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.844
Ijust.. Ifelt like
I had been in there before.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.882
I think it must live
in your head.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.017
Right.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.159
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.260
So? How'd it go?

27:26.310 --> 27:29.404
She said it would take a while
for my PFE to go through, but..

27:29.440 --> 27:32.000
...that I could stay with you
and your mom in the meantime.

27:32.050 --> 27:32.971
That's amazing.

27:33.010 --> 27:37.049
Okay, we have to do something
special tonight.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.287
How do you want to celebrate
your freedom?

27:39.320 --> 27:41.652
Let's make it permanent.

27:46.130 --> 27:47.085
[laughing]

27:48.060 --> 27:49.357
(Spencer)
'We're not leaving here

27:49.400 --> 27:51.925
'until we find something
about Charles.‘

27:54.800 --> 27:57.701
God, what did they
keep down here?

27:57.740 --> 27:59.059
Or should I say who?

27:59.110 --> 28:00.168
Patient records.

28:00.210 --> 28:03.304
Only the staff was allowed
in the basement, not us.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.240
I guarantee Mona's
been down here.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.804
Yeah, where is she?

28:06.850 --> 28:08.442
I thought she was supposed
to be our tour guide.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.938
She wanted to come, but her
mom's attached at the hip.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.083
They, like, shower together.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.728
God, why are all
these doors locked?

28:22.900 --> 28:24.993
Spence, what's wrong?

28:25.970 --> 28:26.891
Nothing.

28:29.970 --> 28:32.109
Wait, that door's open.

28:38.380 --> 28:41.269
[water dripping]

28:50.860 --> 28:54.489
- That's how I know this place.
- What?

28:54.530 --> 28:56.293
'It was in Radley,
not the dollhouse.‘

28:56.330 --> 28:58.264
I've been here before.

29:05.570 --> 29:07.128
I know this room.

29:07.170 --> 29:08.899
Well, then, why am I the only
one doing anything?

29:08.940 --> 29:11.204
'Can you help me?
This is heavy.‘

29:13.410 --> 29:14.741
Thanks.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.983
Okay, once it dries

29:20.020 --> 29:22.113
put this cream on it every day.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.787
Every day.

29:25.030 --> 29:28.124
Oh, wow!
That looks amazing, I love it.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.253
- Your turn.
- What? No.

29:30.300 --> 29:33.997
Come on. I saw you eyeing
that mermaid with the harpoon.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.895
And if my mom ever found out I
got a tattoo, she'd harpoon me.

29:36.940 --> 29:40.262
So get a small one.
In a place she'll never see.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.198
[rap song on speaker]

29:54.620 --> 29:56.281
What does this one mean?

29:56.320 --> 29:59.084
That is the Japanese
symbol for courage.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.893
(Sara)
'It's got your name on it.'

30:00.930 --> 30:04.798
No, but it could.
Have a seat.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.999
Could you hold my phone?

30:12.010 --> 30:14.205
Where do you want it?

30:14.240 --> 30:15.207
Um..

30:16.480 --> 30:18.903
Maybe right...here.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.248
It's just really tender.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.043
Well, it ain't gonna hurt
any less with a needle in it.

30:23.080 --> 30:27.039
Um, how about something a little
closer to the good china?

30:27.090 --> 30:29.979
[rap song on speaker]

30:32.260 --> 30:33.625
Un-friggin'-be|ievable.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.491
Radley has files on patients
who've been dead

30:35.530 --> 30:39.227
since the Stone Age but nothing
from six stupid years ago?

30:40.970 --> 30:43.268
Stop. I found it.
C. DiLaurentis. I got it.

30:46.510 --> 30:48.398
What's it say?

30:48.440 --> 30:51.102
Spencer, talk to me.
Is he dead or not?

30:51.650 --> 30:53.379
Yeah, he's dead.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.119
- What am I looking at?
- It's a work order.

30:57.150 --> 30:59.084
The courier
who transported his organs.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.610
So what?
That doesn't mean squat.

31:00.650 --> 31:04.086
Hanna, you can't donate your
heart, liver and both kidneys

31:04.130 --> 31:06.428
and still play Boggle in the
Radley rec room, he's dead.

31:06.460 --> 31:09.099
Well, someone is pretending
to be him, so who is it?

31:09.130 --> 31:10.620
- Who is Charles?
- I don't know.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.163
This is just a bunch
of medical files.

31:18.940 --> 31:21.033
What are you doing?

31:21.540 --> 31:23.872
[gasping]

31:24.680 --> 31:27.274
Oh, my God. Is that a kneecap?

31:27.310 --> 31:29.414
- Don't touch it. _
- Why would I touch it?

31:31.550 --> 31:33.643
Spencer, where are you going?
If you leave me alone here, I--

31:33.690 --> 31:36.158
Just shut up. I'm just getting
something to fish it out.

31:36.190 --> 31:38.920
Fish it out? I don't wanna see
what it's connected to.

31:42.630 --> 31:44.689
Spencer. Spencer, stop.
Please, stop.

31:44.730 --> 31:47.119
[screaming]

31:47.170 --> 31:49.058
Oh, my God, breathe,
breathe, it's a doll.

31:49.100 --> 31:52.069
- What?
- It's a Resusci Anne.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.533
Well, w-w-what—what is that?
Like a-a blowup thingy?

31:54.580 --> 31:57.174
No, you blow into it,
they use it to teach CPR.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.674
[pounding]

31:59.710 --> 32:01.314
What was that?

32:01.350 --> 32:02.544
It's probably something
you woke out of hibernation

32:02.580 --> 32:04.309
with your screaming.

32:17.760 --> 32:21.059
[machine whirring]

32:24.470 --> 32:27.359
[dramatic music]

32:56.370 --> 32:59.009
I totally could have dropped
this off at church.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.235
Why make you leave your house
if you don't have to?

33:02.140 --> 33:04.973
Because I want to...leave.

33:08.650 --> 33:10.470
That was so wrong.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.217
Alison, your father's
not angry with me.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.387
Or you.

33:16.420 --> 33:19.150
He's angry with himself.

33:19.190 --> 33:22.125
He failed to protect
his own family and..

33:22.160 --> 33:24.264
...that's gotta hurt.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.264
Well, it wouldn't hurt us
as much if he'd just admit it.

33:30.470 --> 33:32.768
Hey, did you notice
who was on site today?

33:32.810 --> 33:34.630
At the curb?

33:34.680 --> 33:37.137
I got the goon
who was on your beat

33:37.180 --> 33:40.149
to trade shifts
with another officer.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.638
Her name's Lydia.
She's nice.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.012
You'll like her.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.209
You didn't have to do that.

33:50.290 --> 33:52.281
I wanted to.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.199
[electronic music]

34:45.810 --> 34:49.075
[dramatic music]

34:58.660 --> 35:01.652
We should probably call my mom,
let her know we're on our way.

35:04.530 --> 35:07.522
- Sara, what's wrong?
- I read the text you got.

35:07.570 --> 35:09.458
From Aria.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.434
What text?

35:14.780 --> 35:16.202
I saw her too.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.878
I've seen her a couple times.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.639
When we went
to Caleb's apartment..

35:19.680 --> 35:21.910
...there was someone across
the street in a black hoodie.

35:21.950 --> 35:24.885
Okay, Sara, let's not
do this here, okay?

35:24.920 --> 35:26.478
We'll talk about it
when we get home.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.158
We'll be okay.

35:30.790 --> 35:33.623
Sara. Sara, wait!

35:33.660 --> 35:37.255
Spencer, come on.
Like, could we just go?

35:37.300 --> 35:38.699
I don't need
any more proof he's dead.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.425
We knew that already,
but we don't know

35:40.470 --> 35:42.358
who Charles was close to,
who he hung outwith.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.628
We're never gonna know that.

35:43.670 --> 35:46.503
Radley doesn't put
out a yearbook.

35:46.540 --> 35:47.529
Let's go.

35:47.570 --> 35:49.299
[rattling]

35:49.340 --> 35:50.807
'Okay, that was definitely
not an animal.‘

35:50.840 --> 35:53.149
I'm leaving here now.

35:58.550 --> 35:59.539
Sara.

36:00.690 --> 36:01.952
Please, don't do this.

36:01.990 --> 36:03.685
You've been looking all along,
haven't you?

36:03.720 --> 36:04.948
What?

36:04.990 --> 36:06.526
For whoever had us down
in that bunker.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.720
Why didn't you want me to know?

36:07.760 --> 36:10.251
Sara, we've been trying
to protect you, okay?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.790
I've been trying to protect you.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.718
I need to protect myself.

36:13.770 --> 36:17.399
I thought we were connecting.
How could you keep this from me?

36:17.440 --> 36:20.204
I had to. A threatened to hurt
you if we told the police

36:20.240 --> 36:21.707
what we found in
that dollhouse.

36:21.740 --> 36:22.934
I don't understand.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.607
Sara, we're getting closer
to figuring out

36:24.650 --> 36:25.674
who this person is.

36:25.710 --> 36:28.178
- Soon, we'll know--
- Oh, my God!

36:29.480 --> 36:30.447
Come on!

36:35.860 --> 36:37.316
[rattling]

36:53.040 --> 36:54.439
What the hell, Mona?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.300
Have you been down here
the whole time?

36:56.340 --> 36:57.568
'Was that you?‘

36:57.610 --> 36:59.498
- Answer us!
- Just let me go.

36:59.550 --> 37:00.699
Please, I'll explain later.

37:00.750 --> 37:01.978
No, you're gonna
explain right now.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.339
Why were you following us?

37:03.380 --> 37:04.381
She didn't want us to find this.

37:04.420 --> 37:05.717
Just give it back to me, okay?

37:05.750 --> 37:07.342
This doesn't have anything
to do with you guys.

37:07.390 --> 37:09.483
Why were you stealing
your file, Mona?

37:11.290 --> 37:13.451
She wasn't.

37:13.490 --> 37:14.718
She was stealing Lesli Stone's.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.490
Wait, what?
Lesli was a patient here too?

37:17.530 --> 37:19.760
Yes, and she doesn't
want it to go public.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.030
Is that how you met her?

37:22.070 --> 37:25.608
Lesli Stone was in Radley. When?

37:25.640 --> 37:27.403
Judging from this, a long time.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.806
Long enough to know
Mona and Charles.

37:32.510 --> 37:34.512
[cellphone beeping]

37:50.530 --> 37:51.758
I've got to go to Hanna's.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.620
- Why?
- She's having a rough night.

37:53.670 --> 37:54.830
She wants her friends
around her.

37:54.870 --> 37:56.064
Does she?

37:56.100 --> 37:58.933
And will Lorenzo be there
to comfort her too?

37:58.970 --> 38:01.632
- I've gotta go.
- You are not going anywhere.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.898
And if you keep this up, I will
take you far away from here.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.407
- I mean it.
- What?

38:05.450 --> 38:07.441
You gonna bury me
at Aunt Carol's farm too?

38:07.480 --> 38:09.516
Shove me in the ground
right next to Charles?

38:09.550 --> 38:11.689
What are you talking about?

38:18.760 --> 38:20.728
Am I crazy?
That's a girl, right?

38:20.760 --> 38:22.421
That's a bust
and it's Leslie Stone's.

38:22.460 --> 38:24.860
Hanna, stop. We barely know
anything about that girl.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.061
I mean, taking us down in
a courtroom is not the same

38:27.100 --> 38:28.124
as taking us down
to that bunker.

38:28.170 --> 38:31.333
Aria's right. I mean, why?
Why would she torture us?

38:31.370 --> 38:33.338
Because she's unstable,
that's why.

38:33.370 --> 38:35.474
That girl's got bigger
mood swings than that..

38:35.510 --> 38:36.932
...Captain Hook ride
at Hershey Park.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.948
And you forgot to mention
that she once shared a room

38:38.980 --> 38:40.800
at Radley with Bethany Young.

38:40.850 --> 38:41.817
(both)
What?

38:41.850 --> 38:42.874
They were roommates

38:42.920 --> 38:44.615
and probably pretty close.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.982
Lesli must think that we helped
Ali kill Bethany that night

38:47.020 --> 38:48.681
and then dumped her body
in that pit.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.415
- Your sister did that.
- No.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.882
Melissa just...buried her alive.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.682
We still have no idea
who bashed her over the head

38:53.730 --> 38:55.550
and Lesli doesn't
know any of it.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.090
She probably thinks
that Alison did the deed

38:57.130 --> 38:58.597
and we helped her
get rid of the body.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.598
But why hide behind
Charles's name?

39:00.630 --> 39:03.463
Maybe she was just as close to
Charles as she was to Bethany.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.569
It all comes back to Charles.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.862
So was Mona covering for Lesli?

39:06.910 --> 39:08.571
I mean, by stealing her file.

39:08.610 --> 39:11.443
Mona said she was doing it
to repair their friendship.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.970
Lesli's got her fooled too.

39:13.010 --> 39:14.978
- Or not.
- What about Sara?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.716
I mean, why would Lesli Stone
go after a complete stranger?

39:17.750 --> 39:19.115
It was probably
just a rehearsal, Em.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.482
Until she could get
her hands on the real Alison.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.521
Okay, so what do we do now?

39:25.560 --> 39:28.120
Well, we know where she lives.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.355
I say we catch her in the act.

39:31.030 --> 39:32.361
How?

39:37.570 --> 39:40.403
I did everything I could,
Lesli, I swear.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.908
Mona, what are you
trying to say?

39:42.940 --> 39:44.476
They know.

39:44.510 --> 39:47.900
What? You're kidding.
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

39:47.950 --> 39:50.510
I asked you to do one thing,
Mona, one freaking thing

39:50.550 --> 39:52.745
'and you screwed it up.
You screwed it up for me!'

39:52.790 --> 39:55.008
'You always
screw everything up!'

39:55.060 --> 39:56.482
* All we do is

39:56.520 --> 39:58.681
* Yay hoo ooh

39:59.690 --> 40:02.488
* Ee ooh ooh ooh ooh

40:02.530 --> 40:04.760
* Ain't no love
when the Wicked run *

40:04.800 --> 40:07.621
* All we do is get laid off

40:07.670 --> 40:10.036
* Lay off lay off

40:10.070 --> 40:12.038
* We're the wicked ones

40:12.070 --> 40:13.958
* Wicked ones

40:23.850 --> 40:27.047
* Lay off
we're the wicked ones *

40:27.090 --> 40:28.819
* Wicked ones *

40:35.830 --> 40:37.752
