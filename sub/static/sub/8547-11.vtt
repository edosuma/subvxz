How long was she in the water?

02:05.274 --> 02:09.609

12:02.284 --> 12:04.150
Reid: The last stage
of cold-induced shock is euphoria,

12:04.152 --> 12:07.153
an almost dreamy elation
before you fall asleep.

12:07.155 --> 12:08.688
When members regain
consciousness,

12:08.690 --> 12:09.728
they feel like
they've been born again.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.395
The reality is,
they almost died.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.897
Focus your search
on hospital records

12:12.899 --> 12:14.298
for patients who
suffered from frostbite.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.300
We believe that Sarah Rhodes isn't
the first victim

12:16.302 --> 12:17.468
that this group has harmed.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.370
Thank you.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.907
Fear.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.842
That's what kills us.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.415
Not our addictions.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.411
Not the toxins in our food.

12:35.412 --> 12:38.747
Those only paralyze us.

12:38.749 --> 12:42.857
Fear is what consumes us.

12:42.858 --> 12:45.859
It's why we go into
the dark, cold place.

12:45.861 --> 12:48.795
We face our fear.

12:49.698 --> 12:51.498
I can see your fear now.

12:51.500 --> 12:55.535
I know who's worthy to move
on to the next level and who isn't,

12:55.537 --> 12:57.738
and you are not worthy,
Adam Lewis.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.773
Unh!

12:59.775 --> 13:02.376
I don't want to do this
anymore.

13:02.378 --> 13:03.477
I'm tired.

13:03.479 --> 13:06.279
I'm hungry. I just--
I want to go home.

13:06.281 --> 13:07.481
Ok, please,

13:07.483 --> 13:09.549
please, just let me go home!

13:09.551 --> 13:11.952
I want to go home.
[Sobbing]

13:18.712 --> 13:19.978
Hey.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.814
Oh. Ok.
Hi, what's up?

13:22.816 --> 13:24.649
Uh, Garcia found
a frostbite victim,

13:24.651 --> 13:25.941
admitted to the hospital
3 years ago,

13:25.942 --> 13:27.241
by the name of Tom Fallon.

13:27.243 --> 13:28.809
Completely off the grid,
just like Sarah,

13:28.811 --> 13:30.511
but his mother Mary
still lives in town.

13:30.513 --> 13:31.411
Great. Let's go.

13:31.412 --> 13:33.779
Kate and Morgan already
went when we couldn't find you.

13:33.781 --> 13:38.750
Which is why I've been waiting here
for 24 minutes and 18 seconds,

13:38.752 --> 13:42.454
so that maybe we can
finally talk about what's wrong.

13:42.456 --> 13:44.389
Nothing's wrong.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.457
I'm fine.

13:45.459 --> 13:47.092
You're not fine.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.760
You're obviously
displaying symptoms

13:48.762 --> 13:50.195
of post-traumatic
stress disorder,

13:50.197 --> 13:52.164
which absolutely
makes sense.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.499
We're coming up on a year since your
abduction and torture,

13:54.501 --> 13:57.536
and anniversary dates
have a power all their own.

13:57.538 --> 13:59.738
Not to mention the fact that seasonal
weather changes bring back smells

13:59.740 --> 14:02.874
that you probably now
can only associate with the initial event.

14:02.876 --> 14:06.077
All that I'm saying
is that what you're going through

14:06.079 --> 14:08.146
is entirely textbook.

14:09.052 --> 14:10.352
In here.

14:14.892 --> 14:17.726
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop doing that.

14:17.728 --> 14:20.495
Stop...being you.

14:20.497 --> 14:21.563
I can't help it.

14:21.565 --> 14:22.565
Yes, you can.

14:22.566 --> 14:24.266
You can.

14:24.268 --> 14:27.969
You think you know
what's going on, but you don't.

14:27.971 --> 14:30.005
Well, then
explain it to me, JJ,

14:30.007 --> 14:32.174
because all I know
is my friend is hurting,

14:32.176 --> 14:35.043
and when I see her
in pain, I want to make it stop.

14:35.203 --> 14:37.703
All right. All right.

14:37.705 --> 14:39.672
Give me a word.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.041
A word?

14:42.043 --> 14:43.009
A term.

14:43.011 --> 14:44.210
A label.

14:44.212 --> 14:46.446
Something that explains
what I have,

14:46.448 --> 14:48.314
because it is bigger
than PTSD,

14:48.316 --> 14:50.883
and right now
that word is Tivon.

14:50.885 --> 14:52.585
Tivon Askari.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.353
The man who tortured you.

14:54.355 --> 14:58.615
No. No, he was more
than that.

14:58.616 --> 15:00.916
He was my partner
in Afghanistan.

15:00.918 --> 15:02.851
I didn't--I didn't know
he was a--

15:02.853 --> 15:04.553
Double agent. I know.
I read the file.

15:04.556 --> 15:06.556
You were attempting
to extract Intel

15:06.558 --> 15:08.591
from a woman
named Nadia.

15:08.593 --> 15:11.995
He set a trap and killed Nadia
and her daughter.

15:11.997 --> 15:16.599
Listen, JJ, you cannot
blame yourself for that.

15:17.630 --> 15:21.331
The Humvee,
was that in the file?

15:21.333 --> 15:22.900
Yeah. You almost caught him.

15:22.902 --> 15:26.103
He set an IED to take out
your convoy.

15:26.105 --> 15:27.204
I know you were wounded--

15:27.206 --> 15:29.239
I was pregnant.

15:32.678 --> 15:36.079
You see, if I had never
gotten involved,

15:36.081 --> 15:38.816
Nadia and her daughter
would still be alive,

15:38.818 --> 15:42.319
and Henry would have
a little...

15:44.898 --> 15:46.598
I can't let this go.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.366
I can't.

15:50.671 --> 15:53.838
What is the word
for that, Spence?

15:55.742 --> 15:57.409
I don't know.

16:09.271 --> 16:12.606
This stays between us. Ok?

16:14.109 --> 16:16.043
Ok.

16:24.586 --> 16:26.687
Where are we
on finding the boat?

16:26.689 --> 16:28.422
Um...

16:28.424 --> 16:31.792
The presumption
is that the, um...

16:31.794 --> 16:33.694
Cult would have
owned the boat.

16:33.696 --> 16:35.295
So I'm just gonna
look at it from that angle.

16:35.297 --> 16:37.431
Is there something
I should know?

16:37.433 --> 16:39.132
No. About--no.

16:39.134 --> 16:41.168
I'll let you know
if I find anything.

16:43.005 --> 16:44.504
[Knock on door]

16:47.009 --> 16:48.158
Yes?

16:48.159 --> 16:49.626
Mrs. Fallon,
we're with the FBI.

16:49.628 --> 16:51.261
We'd like to ask you
a few questions about your son.

16:51.263 --> 16:53.563
The lawyer said
I can't talk to you.

16:53.565 --> 16:54.998
Kate: What lawyer?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.734
Law firm of Kane
and associates.

16:57.736 --> 17:00.069
They represent those weirdoes.

17:00.071 --> 17:02.905
Don't know their names or anything.
Tom wouldn't tell me.

17:04.108 --> 17:06.175
And this is your son's
signature?

17:06.176 --> 17:10.546
The releases saying he knew
he was engaging in risky behavior,

17:10.548 --> 17:14.517
and if I defamed their
character, they'd take my house.

17:15.654 --> 17:17.619
Ma'am, where's your son
right now?

17:17.622 --> 17:18.655
Mother?

17:18.656 --> 17:20.022
Who was at the door?

17:20.025 --> 17:21.595
You need to understand.

17:21.596 --> 17:23.022
After the hospital,

17:23.023 --> 17:26.625
those people didn't
want him anymore.

17:26.627 --> 17:28.961
I've had to keep him
here because...

17:28.963 --> 17:30.696
He's not right.

17:43.853 --> 17:45.353
Tom?

17:46.919 --> 17:47.919
Yes?

17:47.920 --> 17:50.721
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

17:54.126 --> 17:56.727
Do you feel it?

17:56.729 --> 17:58.462
Do you feel it all?

17:59.932 --> 18:01.665
Feel what?

18:03.536 --> 18:05.502
You don't feel it.

18:05.504 --> 18:09.773
Your consciousness is too small
to comprehend it.

18:16.967 --> 18:20.902
I feel the emptiness
of messages bombarding me,

18:20.904 --> 18:24.639
telling me to consume.

18:24.641 --> 18:26.641
I feel like there's
something lacking in my life,

18:26.643 --> 18:29.678
and I feel like you might
have the answer.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.384
I do.

18:31.385 --> 18:32.952
Yes, I do.

18:32.954 --> 18:35.621
Can you tell us where
we can find your friends,

18:35.623 --> 18:38.057
so that we can find
the answer, too?

18:38.059 --> 18:39.419
No.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.053
But it's ok.

18:41.055 --> 18:44.223
They will come back
to me when it's time.

18:44.225 --> 18:47.192
It won't be long now.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.861
Surely you must feel it,

18:49.863 --> 18:54.733
the walls of civilization
crumbling around you.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.694
The forever people
will survive.

18:59.696 --> 19:02.296
How will
they survive?

19:02.298 --> 19:04.732
We'll freeze ourselves.

19:04.734 --> 19:09.203
Have you been there,
in the cold?

19:09.205 --> 19:11.706
If you haven't,
I can help you.

19:11.708 --> 19:13.341
I can help you
the way they helped me.

19:13.342 --> 19:15.609
Tommy, please don't.

19:17.346 --> 19:21.882
They helped me feel it all.

19:51.213 --> 19:53.146
Hey, just...

19:53.148 --> 19:55.980
Please, let me out.

19:55.981 --> 20:01.150
Ohh...Let me out.

20:01.152 --> 20:04.387
I'll be...I'll be good.

20:04.389 --> 20:07.390
I'll do whatever...
Whatever you want.

20:09.527 --> 20:12.395
Wait...No.

20:12.397 --> 20:15.832
Please, I can be good.

20:16.668 --> 20:17.900
[Screaming, moaning]

20:26.949 --> 20:28.449
Ok, so Garcia couldn't
find anything online

20:28.451 --> 20:31.218
about the forever people
or cults that freeze in general,

20:31.220 --> 20:32.753
but she found this guy,
Adam Lewis.

20:32.755 --> 20:34.388
His parents reported him
missing a month ago.

20:34.390 --> 20:37.491
If cryogenics is their hook,
they should try a lot harder to hide it.

20:37.493 --> 20:39.960
Technically, it's cryonics
and not cryogenics.

20:39.962 --> 20:42.530
Cryogenics is a scientifically
proven process involving

20:42.532 --> 20:45.199
the successful freezing
and thawing of materials without damage.

20:45.201 --> 20:47.568
Cryonics involves taking
an already dead body

20:47.570 --> 20:49.003
and putting it
in liquid nitrogen,

20:49.005 --> 20:50.345
and there's no scientific
merit whatsoever.

20:50.346 --> 20:51.812
Hiya. I thought you guys
were getting cold feet.

20:51.814 --> 20:53.247
Oh, pun unintended.

20:53.249 --> 20:56.784
Hotch: Garcia, tell us
if anyone ordered the following supplies.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.986
Besides liquid nitrogen,
they need large stainless steel dewars

20:58.988 --> 21:00.054
for body storage.

21:00.056 --> 21:02.689
That is a big n-o
on all fronts.

21:02.690 --> 21:03.956
What about financial
overlap?

21:03.958 --> 21:05.925
We know that Sarah Rhodes
made monthly withdrawals.

21:05.927 --> 21:08.238
Did Adam Lewis
do something similar?

21:08.239 --> 21:09.739
Uh...Yes.

21:09.741 --> 21:11.240
Actually, he did.

21:11.242 --> 21:13.743
The exact same
amount of money--

21:13.745 --> 21:15.445
260 bucks, to be exact.

21:15.447 --> 21:17.613
And he wrote checks.

21:17.615 --> 21:18.706
Hello, paper trail.

21:18.707 --> 21:22.142
The money went to
the Global Warming Awareness fund.

21:22.144 --> 21:25.245
That's kind of the opposite
end of the spectrum, isn't it?

21:25.247 --> 21:27.714
It makes sense.
Cults frequently set up nonprofits

21:27.716 --> 21:29.010
to hide their earnings
from members.

21:29.011 --> 21:31.245
And you can't apply for nonprofit status
without an address.

21:31.247 --> 21:32.579
I'm way ahead of you, boss.
Garcia.

21:32.581 --> 21:35.482
Here it is.
I've just sent.

21:36.352 --> 21:38.986
As many of you know,
the elite

21:38.988 --> 21:41.555
have been in consultation,

21:41.557 --> 21:43.624
and we are pleased

21:43.626 --> 21:47.494
to announce we have made
our decision.

21:50.553 --> 21:56.957
Some of you will
advance to level 3.

21:56.959 --> 21:58.926
And some of you won't.

21:58.928 --> 22:01.829
Keep in mind this
does not mean the door

22:01.831 --> 22:03.050
to rebirth and renewal
is closed to you.

22:03.051 --> 22:05.218
What it means is--

22:06.054 --> 22:07.054
FBI.

22:07.055 --> 22:09.222
Protocol number 7.

22:09.224 --> 22:13.393
[Police radio chatter]

22:13.395 --> 22:15.562
Do not make eye contact.

22:17.833 --> 22:20.811
Colton Grant, head of
the Global Warming Awareness Front?

22:20.812 --> 22:22.602
I am.

22:22.604 --> 22:24.838
We'd like to talk to you.

22:24.898 --> 22:26.231
Personally.

22:26.233 --> 22:28.500
Of course you would.

22:41.214 --> 22:43.949
Have a seat.

22:52.359 --> 22:54.759
What happened to your hand?

22:57.731 --> 22:59.364
What happened to your hand?

22:59.366 --> 23:01.499
Hmm?

23:19.388 --> 23:21.154
Your turn.

23:37.239 --> 23:39.506
Hmm.

23:39.508 --> 23:43.877
Now, why would you wear a cast
if you didn't have to?

23:49.378 --> 23:52.045
That's, uh...

23:52.047 --> 23:54.314
That's nothing. I...

23:57.085 --> 24:00.153
I've seen the other half
of this. You're Bobby's father.

24:00.155 --> 24:01.621
You're coming with me. Come on.
Wait.

24:01.623 --> 24:03.591
Wait, they will kill him
if you expose me, you understand?

24:03.592 --> 24:05.859
These people
will kill my son.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.131
You're not here because
you're a believer, are you?

24:09.132 --> 24:12.333
Gentlemen, my client
is here on his own volition.

24:12.335 --> 24:14.869
If you denigrate his beliefs
in any way, we're leaving.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.938
You own a boat,
Mr. Grant?

24:17.940 --> 24:19.073
The fund owns one.

24:19.075 --> 24:20.574
They run water
temperature tests

24:20.576 --> 24:22.443
to measure
the greenhouse effects.

24:22.445 --> 24:24.045
But you didn't bring me
in here

24:24.047 --> 24:26.814
to talk about a boat,
now, did you?

24:26.816 --> 24:29.317
Sarah Rhodes and Adam Lewis.

24:29.319 --> 24:32.153
Mm-hmm. What about them?

24:32.155 --> 24:35.056
Seen them recently?

24:35.058 --> 24:37.417
They both requested
to leave the Forever People.

24:37.418 --> 24:39.718
We don't believe
in keeping anyone bound

24:39.720 --> 24:41.353
that doesn't want
to be bound,

24:41.355 --> 24:42.579
so, we wish them well.

24:42.580 --> 24:46.048
Then why did we just pull their
frozen bodies out of Lake Mead?

24:46.050 --> 24:48.584
We're done here. Colton,
don't say another word.

24:48.586 --> 24:51.120
Hotch: This is your last
chance to tell the truth.

24:53.090 --> 24:55.023
Where is Sarah's son?

25:01.057 --> 25:03.524
I believe, to avoid
self-incrimination,

25:03.526 --> 25:06.627
I have the right
to remain silent.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.535
Colton Grant, you are under arrest
for the murders

25:12.536 --> 25:15.003
of Sarah Rhodes
and Adam Lewis.

25:15.005 --> 25:17.239
You do indeed have the right
to remain silent.

25:17.241 --> 25:18.674
And you also have the right...
Give a message to my flock.

25:18.676 --> 25:21.276
Anything you say can and will
This is a test.

25:21.278 --> 25:22.711
Be used against you
we will get through this together,

25:22.713 --> 25:25.180
in a court of law.
And not to lose faith.

25:28.686 --> 25:31.854
I wasn't--I wasn't ready
to be a dad.

25:31.856 --> 25:34.556
I hadn't heard from Sarah
in 5 years,

25:34.558 --> 25:36.892
and that's the way
we both wanted it.

25:36.894 --> 25:39.772
Then, like a month ago, she
called me from a pay phone.

25:39.773 --> 25:41.940
She told me
about this place

25:41.942 --> 25:43.275
and that they wouldn't
let her go.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.543
And, uh...

25:45.545 --> 25:47.978
I told her
that I would join

25:47.980 --> 25:52.450
and, uh, that we'd get
Bobby out together.

25:52.452 --> 25:55.132
As a family.

25:55.133 --> 25:56.866
And then, uh...

25:56.868 --> 25:59.168
She...

25:59.170 --> 26:01.303
She just stopped calling.

26:02.173 --> 26:04.473
How did you get this?

26:10.915 --> 26:14.584
He, uh,
he drew this for me,

26:14.585 --> 26:17.586
the last time we were
together as a family.

26:17.588 --> 26:19.354
He, uh...

26:19.356 --> 26:21.023
He tore it in half

26:21.025 --> 26:24.059
because he wanted--

26:24.061 --> 26:27.396
wanted me and his mom
to both have something of him.

26:27.398 --> 26:30.465
Once I thought
that Sarah was dead,

26:30.467 --> 26:32.801
I sneaked this in
because this is--

26:32.803 --> 26:34.599
this is all I have
to make him believe me.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.634
Why infiltrate?
Why not go to court?

26:37.636 --> 26:39.302
You'd get custody
automatically.

26:39.304 --> 26:43.006
What, do you think
these people respond to lawsuits?

26:43.008 --> 26:44.641
Huh? No, no.

26:44.707 --> 26:45.779
The only hope
that I have

26:45.780 --> 26:47.646
is to get close
enough to him

26:47.648 --> 26:49.619
to steal him away from wherever
they're keeping him.

26:49.620 --> 26:50.652
Which is where?

26:50.654 --> 26:51.787
I don't know.

26:51.789 --> 26:53.488
They bring the kids by
now and then,

26:53.490 --> 26:55.304
but they keep them
behind closed doors.

26:55.305 --> 26:56.871
Well, we'll find him.

26:56.873 --> 26:59.007
How?

26:59.008 --> 27:01.742
Just leave it to me.
Keep your head down

27:01.744 --> 27:04.511
and let us do our job. Ok?

27:04.513 --> 27:06.146
You swear?

27:06.148 --> 27:07.915
You swear that you
won't let me down

27:07.917 --> 27:10.417
and that you will
get us both out of here?

27:10.419 --> 27:12.519
I swear.

27:22.465 --> 27:24.298
We need a stakeout
on that house.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.267
He said they bring
the kids by intermittently.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.702
I'll send
plainclothes up now.

27:27.704 --> 27:30.436
So now what? We sit back
and wait until they bring the kids around?

27:30.437 --> 27:33.037
Well, they know we've arrested
their leader. That's a risky plan.

27:33.039 --> 27:34.787
Especially since we know
Grant isn't the unsub.

27:34.788 --> 27:35.926
How can he not be our guy?

27:35.950 --> 27:37.690
He's the one that shows you
the face of god at 30 below.

27:37.691 --> 27:40.925
He was genuinely surprised when we
showed him the crime scene photos.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.260
I saw that, too.

27:42.262 --> 27:43.728
He didn't sanction
the murders,

27:43.730 --> 27:46.464
which means somebody
else did them.

27:46.466 --> 27:48.900
A second-tier member
pulling a power play, maybe?

27:48.902 --> 27:50.735
It'd be easier to shoot
them and bury them in the desert.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.737
No, this unsub
is replicating the cult's M.O.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.973
Even when he knows law
enforcement is watching.

27:54.975 --> 27:56.138
Except he's not interested
in resuscitating them.

27:56.139 --> 27:58.339
He wants to watch them
freeze to death. That's his compulsion.

27:58.341 --> 28:01.275
He'd be a psychrophile, then, somebody with
a sexual fetish for the cold.

28:01.277 --> 28:02.810
So let me get this straight.

28:02.812 --> 28:05.146
We're saying that there's a serial killer
inside the cult?

28:05.148 --> 28:08.115
Talk about a needle
in a needlestack.

28:08.117 --> 28:09.550
You know, you can see
why the Forever People

28:09.552 --> 28:11.485
would be the perfect fit
for him, then.

28:11.487 --> 28:13.320
The group would satiate
his needs for a while,

28:13.322 --> 28:15.531
like a pedophile who resorts to pornography
to keep his urges in check,

28:15.532 --> 28:17.565
and then when he can't
control himself anymore,

28:17.567 --> 28:19.300
he kills the members
that Colton wouldn't miss,

28:19.302 --> 28:21.169
the ones who were
trying to get out.

28:21.171 --> 28:23.204
Ok, so let's go with
the pedophile analogy.

28:23.206 --> 28:24.939
You show them pictures,
they get excited_

28:24.941 --> 28:26.941
what happened when you
showed pictured of two frozen bodies

28:26.943 --> 28:27.723
to members of that house?

28:27.724 --> 28:29.623
Nobody reacted.
They just stared blankly.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.258
The unsub isn't anyone
we talked to.

28:31.260 --> 28:34.428
Except the kids weren't
inside the house.

28:34.430 --> 28:37.798
And where there's kids
there has to be adult supervision, right?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.434
The unsub's watching
the children.

28:40.436 --> 28:42.428
And before he was led away,

28:42.429 --> 28:45.463
Colton told me to give
a message to all of you.

28:45.466 --> 28:47.867
Do not lose faith.

28:47.869 --> 28:50.836
Now is the time
to meditate on our future.

28:50.838 --> 28:55.141
Direct your positivity
and strength towards your leader.

28:55.143 --> 28:57.510
He will be with us soon.

28:58.841 --> 29:00.174
Peace.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.542
We'll be now quiet.

29:43.291 --> 29:45.324
[Door opens]

29:48.497 --> 29:50.897
Hey.

29:50.899 --> 29:53.533
You want to help me?

29:53.535 --> 29:56.670
Yeah? Where's Bobby?

29:58.228 --> 30:01.930
Why do you want to know,
Carl?

30:01.931 --> 30:04.131
Shh...

30:14.548 --> 30:15.981
Spence.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.683
Booster seats.
The kids are here.

30:20.220 --> 30:21.353
[Pounding on door]

30:21.355 --> 30:23.021
FBI!

30:23.023 --> 30:23.983
What are you doing here?

30:23.984 --> 30:25.516
This is
a private residence.

30:25.518 --> 30:26.850
Get her out of here.

30:26.852 --> 30:28.586
You can't go in there
without a warrant.

30:28.588 --> 30:30.554
Wrong.

30:42.457 --> 30:45.124
There's a trailer out back.

30:45.126 --> 30:46.525
Come on, guys.

30:47.695 --> 30:49.495
We need to get them
into protective custody.

30:49.497 --> 30:51.019
I'll watch over them myself.
We need to regroup with the team.

30:51.020 --> 30:52.653
Bobby. Where's Bobby?

30:52.655 --> 30:53.887
Here.

30:53.889 --> 30:55.889
Did anyone come looking
for you while you were here?

30:55.891 --> 30:57.891
One of the new members,
maybe?

30:57.893 --> 30:59.393
I saw somebody.

30:59.395 --> 31:00.731
Who'd you see, sweetie?

31:00.732 --> 31:02.599
A man, asking about Bobby.

31:03.376 --> 31:06.310
Then brother Jon made him
go to sleep.

31:06.312 --> 31:07.611
Where's brother Jon now?

31:07.613 --> 31:09.747
Probably back at our house.

31:09.749 --> 31:12.316
Where the 5 of us live,
I mean.

31:12.318 --> 31:14.051
Do you know the address,
Bobby?

31:14.053 --> 31:15.719
All right, we got it, JJ.

31:15.721 --> 31:17.844
1818 Smith Street,
residence owned by Jon Kanak.

31:17.844 --> 31:18.810
Tell me.

31:18.812 --> 31:19.811
According to
the police report,

31:19.813 --> 31:21.012
he and his parents
were hiking

31:21.014 --> 31:22.380
in the wilderness
and got lost.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.548
When temperatures
fell below freezing,

31:23.550 --> 31:26.418
they had to do some
godawful stuff to say alive.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.900
[Gasping]

31:28.901 --> 31:31.536
You have 5 seconds
to give me what I want.

31:31.537 --> 31:32.670
[Shuddering]

31:32.672 --> 31:36.140
Ohh! Aah!

31:36.142 --> 31:37.608
Aah!
[Gunshot]

31:38.678 --> 31:41.045
Hotch: JJ.

31:41.047 --> 31:42.636
JJ, did you hear that?

31:42.637 --> 31:43.803
Uh, yeah.

31:43.805 --> 31:45.071
Wait for backup.

31:45.073 --> 31:46.472
No. He already has Carl Mason.

31:46.475 --> 31:47.874
JJ, please wait for us.

31:47.876 --> 31:49.109
I'm already here.

31:49.111 --> 31:51.078
Hurry.
JJ, I'm on my way.

32:25.881 --> 32:26.732
That's acetylene gas
coming out of there,

32:26.733 --> 32:27.964
you know
what that means?

32:27.966 --> 32:29.478
Ok. Let's--
let's talk about this, Jon.

32:29.479 --> 32:32.614
It means, you pull that
trigger and we all die.

32:32.616 --> 32:34.850
Ok? I spark this
and we all die.

32:34.852 --> 32:35.917
Ok.

32:35.919 --> 32:37.452
Ok.

32:38.922 --> 32:40.388
How cold is it in here?

32:40.390 --> 32:42.224
[Laughs]

32:42.226 --> 32:43.959
It's 18 below.

32:43.961 --> 32:46.561
How long do you
think he has?

32:46.563 --> 32:49.397
Enough. Because
at this temperature,

32:49.399 --> 32:51.325
the flashpoint of your gas
won't ignite.

32:51.326 --> 32:52.358
JJ?!

32:52.360 --> 32:53.360
Sound off!

32:53.361 --> 32:55.862
Down here! Do not shoot!

32:57.989 --> 32:58.955
You ok?

32:58.957 --> 33:01.057
Yeah. We need a medic.
Get a medic.

33:01.059 --> 33:02.358
Who's got a knife?

33:14.337 --> 33:16.570
JJ: There he is.

33:20.109 --> 33:21.608
[Door opens]

33:23.312 --> 33:26.980
Bobby, I brought someone.

33:34.836 --> 33:37.169
Hey.

33:38.940 --> 33:40.873
Do you remember me?

33:43.044 --> 33:45.611
No.

33:47.515 --> 33:50.650
Well, that's ok.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.302
Do you remember this?

34:02.541 --> 34:03.974
Dad?

34:10.016 --> 34:11.482
Where have you been?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.920
I've been looking for you.

34:12.922 --> 34:14.254
Don't leave, ok?

34:14.255 --> 34:16.989
I don't know where mom is.

34:16.992 --> 34:18.592
Shh, shh...
Don't go.

34:18.594 --> 34:21.527
Shh, shh, shh.
Look at me.

34:21.530 --> 34:24.931
I will never leave. Ok?

34:24.934 --> 34:26.333
I promise.

34:26.335 --> 34:28.435
Come here.

34:34.176 --> 34:36.610
[Mouthing silently]

34:52.248 --> 34:53.581
Feeling any better?

34:53.583 --> 34:54.982
Sorry?

34:54.984 --> 34:57.885
I thought maybe
reuniting a family would...

34:57.887 --> 34:59.048
Oh...

34:59.048 --> 35:00.848
No.

35:00.850 --> 35:02.483
I'm glad I did my job,

35:02.485 --> 35:05.253
but this doesn't go away
because of some surrogate.

35:05.255 --> 35:07.688
You know who does
think that way?

35:07.690 --> 35:08.789
Serial killers?

35:08.791 --> 35:09.824
Yeah.

35:09.825 --> 35:12.127
Hey, uh, I couldn't
find that word

35:12.129 --> 35:13.428
you asked for,

35:13.430 --> 35:15.630
but I also didn't
want it to be

35:15.632 --> 35:17.398
Tivon Askari anymore,

35:17.400 --> 35:19.267
so I called Emily.

35:19.269 --> 35:20.835
I didn't tell her anything.

35:20.837 --> 35:23.463
I just asked her to pull
any extra background Intel she could.

35:23.464 --> 35:26.398
Apparently people are much
more willing to talk about a terrorist

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
once he's dead.

35:27.401 --> 35:29.467
Anyway, I put it
in your old office in case

35:29.468 --> 35:33.603
you wanted some privacy. You don't
have to look at it if you don't want.

35:33.605 --> 35:35.038
Good night.

35:37.075 --> 35:39.409
Spence.

36:21.187 --> 36:22.656
Man's voice: Tivon Askari
grew up an orphan

36:22.657 --> 36:24.256
on the streets of Tikrit.

36:24.258 --> 36:31.997
He survived as a homeless child
from ages 7 to 9.

36:31.999 --> 36:37.136
He was raped for the first time
at the age of 10.

36:48.722 --> 36:54.926
By the age of 13,
he had killed 3 people.

36:54.928 --> 36:59.984
Violence became
a sexual act.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.699
Men, women, children.

37:04.700 --> 37:08.169
It didn't matter.

37:08.171 --> 37:12.845
By the time I joined the Iraqi
National Guard as an interrogator,

37:13.218 --> 37:15.518
I had everything I needed.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.155
Life became
a simple equation.

37:19.157 --> 37:23.393
How long until you break?

37:25.697 --> 37:27.025
You broke me.

37:27.026 --> 37:29.226
Oh, no.

37:29.228 --> 37:31.711
I bent you.

37:31.712 --> 37:35.314
I wanted to do
so much worse.

37:35.316 --> 37:37.783
You took my baby.

37:37.785 --> 37:40.219
Yes.

37:40.221 --> 37:42.755
I did.

37:42.757 --> 37:45.791
And it pleased me greatly.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.566
Why am I not past you?

37:49.567 --> 37:51.501
For a year I've been fine.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.869
Have you?

37:55.184 --> 37:58.519
What do you want
from me?

37:58.944 --> 38:01.377
I have nothing left.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.279
You've taken everything.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.548
Oh, Jennifer,

38:05.550 --> 38:10.865
there is so much more
I'm going to take.

38:10.866 --> 38:15.635
First, I'm going to take
your sleep.

38:15.637 --> 38:19.639
Then, your smile.

38:19.641 --> 38:23.610
I won't let you
feel safe anywhere.

38:23.612 --> 38:26.646
So I'll take your job.

38:29.164 --> 38:30.830
And finally,

38:30.832 --> 38:33.900
I will transform you

38:33.902 --> 38:36.970
so that your husband
and your son

38:36.972 --> 38:39.440
won't recognize you
anymore.

38:39.441 --> 38:41.575
You can't.

38:41.577 --> 38:43.076
I won't let you.

38:43.078 --> 38:46.513
You already are.

38:46.515 --> 38:49.583
Think about the risk
you took at that freezer.

38:49.585 --> 38:54.688
You had no idea
that the gas would ignite or not.

38:54.690 --> 38:58.892
It was dumb luck
that you got out of there alive.

38:58.894 --> 39:02.214
Either you will
try that again...

39:02.215 --> 39:05.416
And I will watch you
kill yourself,

39:05.418 --> 39:07.885
or you will quit...

39:07.887 --> 39:12.323
And I will watch you
wither and fade.

39:12.325 --> 39:15.330
Either way,

39:15.331 --> 39:16.830
I win.

39:19.602 --> 39:22.102
No.

39:22.104 --> 39:24.872
Yes.

39:24.874 --> 39:26.941
[Hits desk] No!

39:52.400 --> 39:54.634
No.
