00:47.005 --> 00:48.772
These shots are free.

00:48.872 --> 00:50.364
Give them to anyone
who wants them,

00:50.464 --> 00:52.163
but be careful
to explain the risks.

00:52.263 --> 00:54.697
Handing out promicin like candy
changes everything, Shawn.

00:54.797 --> 00:57.420
Nobody can predict what's going
to happen once people everywhere

00:57.520 --> 00:58.689
start developing abilities.

00:59.714 --> 01:01.111
How's it going, sibling?

01:01.211 --> 01:03.256
April Skouris,
black sheep of the family.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.164
You don't really
know this girl, do you?

01:05.263 --> 01:06.652
While we were planning
our wedding,

01:06.752 --> 01:08.593
you were working with Ryland,
betraying me...

01:08.693 --> 01:11.013
- Where's the promicin?
- Get your hands off of me.

01:11.258 --> 01:12.746
He's stable.
that's the good news.

01:12.846 --> 01:15.574
But he hasn't regained consciousness.
They don't know when he will.

01:15.674 --> 01:16.908
I have a job offer
in spain.

01:17.135 --> 01:18.145
If you come with me.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.683
If Collier's right, if moving
into this new world of his

01:20.783 --> 01:22.562
means more upheaval
in the here and now,

01:22.662 --> 01:24.707
I'm going to find myself a place
where I can live

01:24.807 --> 01:26.591
at peace with my daughter
as long as I can.

01:26.724 --> 01:28.265
Alana's picture's gone out
to every hospital

01:28.365 --> 01:29.699
and law enforcement
agency in the country.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.719
Nobody's seen her, Tom.
I'm sorry.

01:39.819 --> 01:40.886
Hey, Kyle!

01:41.186 --> 01:43.122
You ready? Come on, buddy.
It's starting soon.

01:43.245 --> 01:44.769
You think
i'd be late for this?

01:44.874 --> 01:46.482
I'm as psyched
as you are, dad.

01:46.582 --> 01:47.899
Good,
let's do it, then.

02:18.912 --> 02:20.245
I saved you
some seats.

02:20.345 --> 02:21.462
Sorry.

02:22.936 --> 02:24.570
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Maia.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.203
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

02:26.303 --> 02:28.444
You said you'd be late,
so I held things up for you.

02:38.848 --> 02:39.873
Hey, guys.

02:39.973 --> 02:41.417
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

02:41.737 --> 02:43.779
Hi, Tess.
Hi, honey.

02:43.879 --> 02:44.931
Good to see you.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.688
- Kevin...
- How are you?

02:47.748 --> 02:49.507
I thought
you'd never make it.

02:49.727 --> 02:51.160
Well, I had a little help.

02:57.656 --> 02:58.872
Thank you.

02:59.072 --> 03:00.655
I appreciate the applause,

03:00.755 --> 03:02.622
even though I know
who it's really for.

03:02.955 --> 03:04.951
We're all here to give thanks
to one man,

03:05.051 --> 03:07.402
a man who took
a dark and dangerous world...

03:07.502 --> 03:08.518
and healed it.

03:08.618 --> 03:10.944
A man who eliminated
disease and war

03:11.056 --> 03:13.630
and changed our ideas
of what it is to be a human being.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.765
He made 4400 abilities
available to everyone,

03:16.912 --> 03:19.152
and all of our lives
are better for it.

03:19.482 --> 03:20.865
Some call him
a savior,

03:20.965 --> 03:22.515
some call him a messiah.

03:22.690 --> 03:26.268
He's all that and more.
Ladies and gentlemen, M. Jordan Collier.

03:36.075 --> 03:38.174
Today,
this morning,

03:38.981 --> 03:40.640
here and everywhere,

03:41.340 --> 03:43.107
it is good to be alive!

03:48.189 --> 03:51.195
United, like humanity
has never been united.

03:51.786 --> 03:53.774
Through promicin,
the gift I brought you,

03:53.874 --> 03:55.923
and that you... accepted.

03:57.273 --> 04:00.140
Together, we have created
heaven on earth,

04:00.623 --> 04:01.789
a time of joy,

04:02.223 --> 04:03.722
endless joy,

04:04.606 --> 04:06.072
that we share
as one.

04:07.406 --> 04:08.472
And for that,

04:09.239 --> 04:11.756
I say let us bow our heads
in thanks.

05:06.087 --> 05:07.100
It's okay.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.208
It was a dream.

05:10.821 --> 05:12.377
You were dreaming...
again.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.529
What was it about this time?

05:18.883 --> 05:20.610
I handed out the promicin.

05:21.410 --> 05:23.143
I stopped the catastrophe.

05:25.376 --> 05:26.993
It was the right thing to do.

05:27.421 --> 05:29.055
We saved the future from...

05:29.155 --> 05:30.271
I know...

05:30.638 --> 05:32.705
what kind of world I prevented.

05:34.621 --> 05:37.138
But is the world I created
any better?

06:57.535 --> 06:58.618
More, please.

07:04.496 --> 07:06.579
That is
so disgusting.

07:06.812 --> 07:08.996
You said you wouldn't do that
in front of me anymore.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.096
It's gross.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.029
It's not disgusting.
It's love,

07:13.146 --> 07:15.613
and one day,
you'll understand.

07:17.684 --> 07:20.017
So, mommy,
when are you going to tell us?

07:22.467 --> 07:23.475
Tell us what?

07:23.625 --> 07:25.225
Mommy got the job offer.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.350
The job with the european union
came through?

07:27.450 --> 07:29.900
She'll be advising them
on all things 4400.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.067
They said we could live
anywhere in the E.U.

07:32.241 --> 07:34.091
The benefit package
is unbelievable.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.237
Is there anything
the job doesn't come with?

07:39.337 --> 07:40.672
Yeah, a gun,

07:41.006 --> 07:42.939
which makes it
just about perfect.

07:43.726 --> 07:45.001
If I take this,

07:45.101 --> 07:47.768
it means that we're not
just on vacation anymore.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.760
We have to settle down
somewhere.

07:51.897 --> 07:52.964
So how about it?

07:53.891 --> 07:56.224
Is everyone ready
to put down some roots?

08:18.807 --> 08:21.162
- Hey, dad.
- When did you get back into town?

08:21.929 --> 08:23.079
Why didn't you call me?

08:23.179 --> 08:24.179
Honestly?

08:26.117 --> 08:28.895
The way things left off, I wasn't sure
you wanted to hear from me.

08:29.762 --> 08:32.904
You said you wanted some distance.
I was trying to respect that,

08:33.082 --> 08:34.433
but you should
know you...

08:34.916 --> 08:36.316
You can talk to me any time.

08:36.746 --> 08:38.038
I start this new job tomorrow.

08:38.138 --> 08:40.179
It's a legal aid thing
helping out the 4400.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.328
I was going to get a hotel, you know,
while I looked for an apartment,

08:43.429 --> 08:46.413
but it just seemed kind of stupid
you being here all by yourself.

08:47.524 --> 08:48.857
Still no word
on Alana?

08:55.073 --> 08:56.473
I could use some company.

09:03.780 --> 09:05.463
I'm sorry she's gone, dad.

09:07.404 --> 09:08.671
I really liked her.

09:10.205 --> 09:11.238
She loved you.

09:11.821 --> 09:12.905
Yeah, Iknow.

09:16.121 --> 09:18.079
I keep hoping
that i'll come home some day,

09:18.179 --> 09:19.754
and she's just going to be here.

09:23.986 --> 09:25.302
I'm going to go unpack. OK?

09:25.402 --> 09:26.894
I want to go
see Shawn later.

09:32.857 --> 09:33.923
Welcome home.

09:36.057 --> 09:37.073
Thanks.

09:50.426 --> 09:52.443
<i>The good news is
I'm not dead.</i>

09:53.067 --> 09:55.901
<i>I took the shot three days ago
and i'm still here.</i>

10:04.364 --> 10:06.712
<i>Graham...
A.K.A. No one.</i>

10:09.720 --> 10:11.070
OK, so...

10:11.532 --> 10:13.499
I kind of want to
go to the prom with Jeff.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.082
Amber!

10:18.815 --> 10:20.099
<i>Such a stupid geek.</i>

10:26.080 --> 10:27.355
All right, guys, get in here.

10:27.455 --> 10:29.487
Time to pick teams.
Come on, move it.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.130
Line up over here, guys.

10:31.613 --> 10:34.014
Come on, Mike! You're always
the last one. Hurry up!

10:34.131 --> 10:36.014
I'll take...

10:46.287 --> 10:47.295
Graham.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.537
I want Graham.

10:50.907 --> 10:51.940
Me?

10:53.124 --> 10:54.157
Wait a minute.

10:54.690 --> 10:56.482
- I'm taking Graham.
- Guys...

10:56.582 --> 10:58.340
come one,
stop messing with me.

10:58.590 --> 11:00.640
Everyone knows
I suck at basketball.

11:00.740 --> 11:01.748
Listen up.

11:02.448 --> 11:04.398
If Graham doesn't want to
shoot hoops,

11:04.798 --> 11:06.598
then hoops is off the menu.

11:08.865 --> 11:10.248
So how about it,
Graham?

11:10.615 --> 11:11.923
What do you
want to play?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.273
You're serious?

11:15.890 --> 11:16.907
Absolutely.

11:17.030 --> 11:18.614
We can play
whatever you want.

11:18.822 --> 11:19.830
Tell us what to do.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.763
- Thumb wrestling?
- All right...

11:23.363 --> 11:24.813
thumb wrestling it is.

11:25.114 --> 11:26.139
Pair up!

11:26.239 --> 11:28.447
You two over here,
come on, come on, move it!

11:28.547 --> 11:31.098
You two guys, over here.
Mike, you and Billy over here.

11:45.587 --> 11:46.637
What's going on?

11:46.970 --> 11:48.903
Say hello to
the new head of NTAC.

11:50.353 --> 11:51.361
I don't get it.

11:51.517 --> 11:53.988
The woman doesn't have a single day
of law enforcement experience.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.982
She works in a think tank
for a few years,

11:56.082 --> 11:58.487
so they give her a gun and a badge
and tell her to go play sheriff?

11:58.587 --> 12:00.399
I heard she managed
the flow of refugees

12:00.499 --> 12:01.764
after the hurricanes
in texas,

12:01.864 --> 12:04.821
- and did a good job of it, too.
- She's a political appointment.

12:04.921 --> 12:07.018
Probably smiled at the right person
at some cocktail party,

12:07.118 --> 12:09.194
so they passed over
all the qualified people.

12:09.456 --> 12:10.489
Oh, and, Tom...

12:10.606 --> 12:13.056
she said she wanted to see you
as soon as you got in.

12:21.665 --> 12:23.265
- Hi. I'm...
- ... Tom Baldwin.

12:23.778 --> 12:25.611
I know.
Meghan Doyle.

12:26.695 --> 12:28.311
Does that look
straight to you?

12:30.789 --> 12:32.089
Sure. That...

12:32.472 --> 12:33.488
It looks good.

12:35.039 --> 12:36.055
You must like subtitles.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.839
Have you ever seen
<i>La Dolce Vita</i> ?

12:38.938 --> 12:40.122
Honestly? No.

12:40.230 --> 12:43.502
I'm getting the distinct impression
no one else around here has either,

12:43.624 --> 12:44.691
but that's okay.

12:44.791 --> 12:46.207
You should check it out, though.

12:46.862 --> 12:48.008
Okay, i'll do that.

12:48.108 --> 12:50.387
Relax, Tom.
It's not homework.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.620
Please, come
and sit down.

12:56.406 --> 12:58.089
There's something
I want you to see.

12:59.273 --> 13:01.223
Something to get us off
on the right foot.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.803
Open it.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.153
It's interesting.

13:07.270 --> 13:08.961
You do know i'm not cleared
to read this?

13:09.061 --> 13:10.865
Of course,
but i've read your file.

13:11.069 --> 13:14.019
You don't seem like the kind of agent
who'd let that bother you.

13:14.999 --> 13:16.116
Go ahead.

13:16.432 --> 13:17.866
I won't tell if you won't.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.990
This is all about Isabelle Tyler.

13:26.090 --> 13:28.790
- Why are you showing me this?
- She can have visitors now.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.990
I figured you might
want to see her.

13:33.315 --> 13:36.115
I know you've been looking for
Alana Mareva for three months.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.182
I also know
that you're at a dead end.

13:38.659 --> 13:41.475
You must have considered the possibility
that she was abducted again.

13:41.656 --> 13:44.147
Of course, people don't just fall
off the edge of the planet.

13:44.247 --> 13:46.064
Isabelle Tyler
is the one person alive

13:46.164 --> 13:48.198
with a tangible connection
to the future.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.303
If they did take Alana,

13:50.799 --> 13:53.107
maybe Isabelle will be able to
tell you something.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.991
You sure this isn't going to
blow back on you?

13:55.091 --> 13:56.632
You just started.
I don't want to get you in trouble.

13:56.732 --> 14:00.174
If I succeed in this job,
if I bring in Jordan Collier,

14:00.566 --> 14:03.137
no one's going to mind
if a few rules are broken along the way,

14:03.237 --> 14:04.265
and if I don't,

14:05.045 --> 14:07.205
no amount of toeing the line
will save me.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.278
I appreciate this.
Thanks.

14:15.557 --> 14:16.890
You know those posters.

14:18.177 --> 14:20.948
You have a taste for foreign films,
people think you're intellectual

14:21.048 --> 14:22.139
or a radical.

14:23.223 --> 14:25.339
The truth is,
I just like the movies.

14:27.607 --> 14:30.565
Are you sure you don't like
that they make people uncomfortable?

14:31.481 --> 14:32.815
Maybe that, too.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.509
Hey, buddy.

14:49.825 --> 14:50.892
Can you hear me?

14:57.792 --> 14:59.334
My dad says
when I was in a coma,

14:59.434 --> 15:01.213
he used to talk to me
all the time.

15:01.642 --> 15:03.591
I don't remember any of it,
but...

15:03.808 --> 15:05.374
who knows?
Maybe it helped.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.048
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

15:12.298 --> 15:13.315
I tried.

15:15.553 --> 15:17.486
Three months ago,
I took the shot.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.953
I was so scared,
but I just did it anyway.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.553
I was thinking
maybe I could wake you up.

15:25.829 --> 15:27.362
Same as you did for me.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.529
Want to hear the punch line?
Nothing happened.

15:33.996 --> 15:36.596
Three months, no ability.
Nothing. I mean, nothing.

15:38.610 --> 15:40.810
Nothing's changed at all,
really.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.127
That's weird, huh?

15:49.488 --> 15:50.522
I tried.

15:54.171 --> 15:55.255
I'm sorry.

16:16.808 --> 16:17.842
Hello?

16:21.950 --> 16:22.966
Excuse me.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.633
Are you lost?

16:35.090 --> 16:36.124
Help me.

16:36.507 --> 16:37.507
Help me.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.613
<i>There are dead people
everywhere I go.</i>

16:47.163 --> 16:48.247
They hate me.

16:50.413 --> 16:51.713
I made them dead.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.113
We made them dead.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.921
Tess, we gave them a choice.

16:55.021 --> 16:57.188
We didn't force
the shots on anyone.

17:01.214 --> 17:02.848
I want you to take
your medication.

17:03.431 --> 17:05.864
All right?
It'll make you feel better.

17:06.131 --> 17:07.330
Come on,
come on.

17:16.461 --> 17:18.611
She'll calm down
once she's had her pills.

17:19.161 --> 17:20.761
Is that your medical opinion?

17:21.728 --> 17:23.560
Tess is schizophrenic.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.327
The strain of hiding out,
the guilt over what we did,

17:27.452 --> 17:28.484
she can't handle it.

17:28.585 --> 17:31.280
It's caused a break.
She needs medical care

17:31.380 --> 17:32.527
beyond what
we can provide.

17:32.627 --> 17:34.627
Till I find a doctor
sympathetic to us,

17:34.727 --> 17:37.611
you'll have to administer
her medications yourself.

17:39.883 --> 17:41.216
Well, you just remember,

17:42.349 --> 17:43.666
Tess' ability...

17:44.115 --> 17:45.881
is what keeps you safe.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.848
If it wasn't for her, you'd have
been arrested a long time ago.

17:48.948 --> 17:50.015
And I promise you,

17:50.331 --> 17:53.048
I don't care
if the fate of the world is at stake,

17:53.356 --> 17:56.455
I will not sacrifice Tess
to you.

17:59.455 --> 18:00.730
Or your cause.

18:01.130 --> 18:02.630
Our cause, Kevin.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.430
Ours.

18:36.101 --> 18:38.261
Hey, guys.

18:38.582 --> 18:40.413
- What's up?
- All of us were talking,

18:41.042 --> 18:42.554
and we just want you to know

18:43.567 --> 18:45.333
we're with you.
All of us.

18:46.957 --> 18:47.980
We believe.

18:49.142 --> 18:50.405
- In what?
- In you.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.574
We're not the only ones.

18:53.834 --> 18:54.848
We brought someone.

18:58.703 --> 18:59.811
Oh, my god.

19:02.245 --> 19:03.325
Amber?

19:04.845 --> 19:05.953
What are you doing here?

19:06.131 --> 19:07.511
I came to be with you.

19:15.346 --> 19:16.604
What the hell is going...

19:19.162 --> 19:20.711
Amber, wait a minute.

19:23.485 --> 19:25.870
You know those shots
you always hear about on the news?

19:29.263 --> 19:30.324
I took them.

19:31.388 --> 19:34.116
I think maybe
it's screwing you guys up.

19:34.219 --> 19:35.872
No, Graham, it's you.

19:36.464 --> 19:37.750
We want to be close to you.

19:38.069 --> 19:39.440
We want to be close
to the light.

19:40.186 --> 19:42.139
- What light?
- The one that shines out of you.

19:42.562 --> 19:43.999
I didn't see it until today,

19:44.293 --> 19:45.392
but now I do.

19:46.029 --> 19:47.043
It's beautiful.

19:47.645 --> 19:48.699
You're beautiful.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.513
Are you sure
you want to do this?

20:14.261 --> 20:15.557
They told you to kill me.

20:17.153 --> 20:18.196
You didn't do it.

20:19.204 --> 20:21.655
Did you ever think maybe
that's why your girlfriend's gone?

20:22.700 --> 20:23.704
It's your punishment.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.291
Is that something you think,
or is that something you know?

20:32.427 --> 20:33.432
How's Shawn?

20:34.662 --> 20:35.695
Any change?

20:37.558 --> 20:40.135
He's in a regular hospital now.
Long-term care.

20:40.257 --> 20:42.508
What about my father?
Has anybody heard from him?

20:42.690 --> 20:44.395
No, he's on our list,
and we'll find him.

20:44.508 --> 20:45.536
Now, Isabelle,

20:45.822 --> 20:48.592
if you know anything
about Alana, please tell me.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.620
Just tell me, please!

20:56.349 --> 20:57.804
You want to have hope,
don't you?

20:58.020 --> 20:59.626
You want to believe
she's coming back.

21:00.224 --> 21:01.247
Of course.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.229
Then you don't want to know
what I know.

21:06.486 --> 21:07.857
I'm sorry, Tom.
I really am,

21:07.990 --> 21:09.005
but they used you.

21:11.466 --> 21:12.828
The same way they used me.

21:22.621 --> 21:24.433
- <i>Hola</i> ?
- <i>Hey, Diana.</i>

21:24.616 --> 21:25.831
It's me, Marco.

21:26.701 --> 21:28.521
<i>Are you having
a good time in Spain?</i>

21:28.633 --> 21:29.942
Yeah, hey, Marco!

21:30.217 --> 21:31.836
Yeah, no, everything's good.

21:32.439 --> 21:33.444
Are you okay?

21:33.561 --> 21:35.326
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

21:36.506 --> 21:38.482
Uh, something came up, though.

21:39.338 --> 21:42.240
<i>A couple days ago,
some agents raided an apartment.</i>

21:42.961 --> 21:44.352
<i>There was a lot of promicin there.</i>

21:44.452 --> 21:47.026
One of the guys they brought in
gave up a whole bunch of names.

21:47.126 --> 21:48.606
People they'd given syringes to?

21:48.729 --> 21:50.723
Okay, so what is it
you want to tell me, Marco?

21:53.239 --> 21:54.959
One of the names
was April Skouris.

21:58.802 --> 22:00.680
My sister took the shots?

22:00.817 --> 22:02.864
<i>The guy didn't know
if she actually injected them,</i>

22:02.977 --> 22:04.560
<i>but she definitely had them.</i>

22:05.356 --> 22:06.582
<i>Have you heard from her?</i>

22:06.772 --> 22:08.772
No, I haven't heard from her
in months.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.744
She didn't call me on my birthday,
but I...

22:10.913 --> 22:12.816
figured, April, you know?

22:13.463 --> 22:14.895
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

22:16.016 --> 22:17.861
Look, I'm sorry, Di.

22:17.983 --> 22:19.880
I just... You know,
I thought you should know.

22:20.216 --> 22:21.319
I appreciate it.

22:22.229 --> 22:23.244
Thanks.

22:24.024 --> 22:25.038
Bye.

22:26.949 --> 22:28.442
You're going back to Seattle,

22:29.206 --> 22:30.314
aren't you?

22:32.118 --> 22:34.606
That used to be a statue
of our namesake.

22:35.247 --> 22:37.613
Last night,
a dozen students tore it down

22:38.060 --> 22:39.205
and put that thing up.

22:40.257 --> 22:41.449
When we asked them why,

22:41.660 --> 22:44.026
they said it was a statue
of Graham Holt.

22:44.911 --> 22:46.611
Who's Graham Holt?

22:47.559 --> 22:48.654
He's a junior.

22:48.852 --> 22:52.335
C student.
Basically unremarkable in every way.

22:52.803 --> 22:55.254
So this kid pulls a prank,
and you call NTAC?

22:55.395 --> 22:58.605
I called NTAC because I think maybe
this kid took some of those shots.

22:58.705 --> 23:00.708
I mean, what's going on around here
isn't normal.

23:00.877 --> 23:02.479
The posters, the statue.

23:03.613 --> 23:05.108
Last night, our valedictorian

23:05.224 --> 23:07.700
revised her application essay
to Stanford.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.022
She read it to her guidance counselor
this morning.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.855
It's 500 words
on how Graham Holt

23:13.965 --> 23:15.791
is the most important
spiritual leader

23:15.930 --> 23:17.357
since the time of Christ.

23:18.615 --> 23:20.644
I called him into my office
earlier this morning.

23:20.747 --> 23:23.907
He claims to have no idea
about what's going on.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.496
I think we need to meet
this Graham Holt.

23:26.609 --> 23:28.198
From now on,
everyone's favorite band

23:28.318 --> 23:29.541
is <i>TV on the Radio</i>.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.539
Got that?
<i>TV on the Radio</i>.

23:31.886 --> 23:33.172
They're the best band out there.

23:33.952 --> 23:35.018
Excuse me. Graham?

23:35.118 --> 23:36.817
These gentlemen'd like
to have a word with you.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.602
I'm agent Baldwin.
this is agent Garrity.

23:38.702 --> 23:39.719
We work at NTAC.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.551
We're gonna have
to ask you to come with us.

23:43.651 --> 23:45.778
We're gonna bring you in to NTAC
and give you a test

23:45.878 --> 23:47.521
to see if you're
promicin positive.

23:48.256 --> 23:50.082
- Why?
- Look around you, Graham.

23:50.182 --> 23:51.303
I think you know why.

23:51.717 --> 23:52.803
Do I have a choice?

23:52.903 --> 23:54.734
You have a choice whether or not
you do it in handcuffs.

23:54.834 --> 23:55.844
If you haven't taken the shot,

23:55.944 --> 23:58.168
you don't have anything
to worry about. Come on.

24:23.285 --> 24:24.938
You're sitting in my spot.

24:29.645 --> 24:31.572
I didn't realize
these benches were assigned.

24:31.672 --> 24:32.716
Well, they are.

24:33.255 --> 24:34.297
Literally.

24:35.133 --> 24:36.718
I'm in my first year
at the institute.

24:37.169 --> 24:38.314
Art and design?

24:39.180 --> 24:40.727
I'm supposed to do
a charcoal sketch

24:40.830 --> 24:43.396
of a view from the park
every day for seven days.

24:43.603 --> 24:44.682
You're in my spot.

24:45.579 --> 24:47.334
Okay. I'll move.

24:49.166 --> 24:50.865
- I'll move.
- Thanks, Kyle.

24:50.978 --> 24:52.076
I appreciate that.

24:54.605 --> 24:55.844
How do you know my name?

24:57.058 --> 24:58.072
Honestly?

24:59.053 --> 25:01.025
I recognized you
as soon as I walked up.

25:01.950 --> 25:03.575
I read a lot about the 4400.

25:03.992 --> 25:05.772
Which means I read a lot about you.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.842
I guess you know all about
me and Jordan Collier?

25:08.955 --> 25:10.082
Yeah, I do.

25:10.495 --> 25:11.818
Kind of hard to avoid.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.381
You know it wasn't me
who shot him right?

25:16.493 --> 25:17.535
Not really me.

25:18.193 --> 25:20.098
I didn't really believe it was you.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.714
You didn't look like a killer to me.

25:23.769 --> 25:25.511
I guess that's a kind of compliment.

25:25.638 --> 25:26.708
Thank you.

25:27.697 --> 25:28.797
I have to get back to work,

25:28.897 --> 25:30.694
but good luck
with your assignment.

25:32.143 --> 25:33.157
Cassie...

25:33.411 --> 25:34.472
Dunleavy.

25:39.506 --> 25:41.018
Maybe I'll see you around.

25:41.675 --> 25:44.294
I'll be here
for the next seven days.

25:47.778 --> 25:50.028
Seems to me there's
a very simple explanation

25:50.128 --> 25:51.696
for what's going on
at Stevenson High.

25:51.796 --> 25:53.476
This kid, Graham,
took the promicin shot,

25:53.576 --> 25:55.525
and now everyone who meets him
thinks he's god.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.487
Come on, come on.
I've heard you tend to move

25:57.587 --> 25:59.511
directly to the point, Marco,
but really, god?

25:59.652 --> 26:02.554
Well, obviously,
he's not <i>the</i> god.

26:03.004 --> 26:05.875
At best, he's <i>a</i> god,
a minor deity.

26:05.975 --> 26:08.164
Whatever. These kids
are building effigies of him.

26:08.264 --> 26:10.029
They're willing to fight us
to protect him.

26:10.129 --> 26:11.211
Sounds like worship to me.

26:11.311 --> 26:12.811
You are lucky
you weren't turned.

26:12.997 --> 26:14.935
Seems like you only need
a couple minutes around Graham

26:15.035 --> 26:16.144
before you find religion.

26:16.244 --> 26:17.476
Maybe they're unlucky.

26:17.579 --> 26:19.729
Absolute devotion is
a rarity in the modern age.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.800
It might bring a real sense
of purpose to life.

26:22.089 --> 26:24.400
- A clarity.
- Guys, what do we do with this kid?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.483
We go back with more people.
We isolate him.

26:26.741 --> 26:29.182
- Hope the effects wear off.
- But I'd do it fast.

26:29.698 --> 26:31.443
Sounds like Graham's
pretty much focused

26:31.543 --> 26:32.740
on being king of the school.

26:32.896 --> 26:34.642
Imagine what happens
if he learns to think

26:34.892 --> 26:36.254
a little more ambitiously.

26:41.027 --> 26:42.435
What the hell is that?

27:01.345 --> 27:03.280
Are you here
to give yourselves

27:03.393 --> 27:05.646
body and soul
to Graham Holt?

27:06.949 --> 27:08.114
Not exactly.

27:08.898 --> 27:10.485
Then I suggest you leave.

27:11.180 --> 27:12.692
These streets are his.

27:13.481 --> 27:15.518
We'll defend them
with our lives.

27:28.577 --> 27:30.202
Just take your men
around that way.

27:35.804 --> 27:37.137
This is me, Graham.

27:37.395 --> 27:39.583
- What do you want?
- <i>I want you to end this, Graham.</i>

27:39.703 --> 27:41.615
If you don't come out,
these people are gonna get hurt.

27:41.715 --> 27:43.973
- That what you want?
- <i>No, of course not.</i>

27:44.142 --> 27:45.908
These people are just
trying to protect me.

27:46.035 --> 27:48.849
You're forcing them to be here.
You've taken away their free will.

27:48.949 --> 27:50.927
- Their lives are in your hands.
- <i>I understand.</i>

27:51.180 --> 27:53.265
<i>I don't want anything bad
to happen to them either,</i>

27:53.424 --> 27:55.697
but you just need to
give me some time.

27:56.201 --> 27:58.022
<i>Like, a night to figure this out.</i>

27:58.290 --> 27:59.398
<i>Okay? One night.</i>

28:02.230 --> 28:03.601
I just bought us some time.

28:06.099 --> 28:07.479
We've got planning to do.

28:16.452 --> 28:18.086
Try not to look so gloomy, okay?

28:19.700 --> 28:20.761
And who knows?

28:20.883 --> 28:22.864
She might not even be able
to get into Seattle.

28:23.543 --> 28:25.421
She'd be right back here
in a couple hours.

28:27.988 --> 28:29.669
She's never coming back here.

28:32.982 --> 28:34.334
She said she is, Maia,

28:36.210 --> 28:37.740
and I really need
to believe that.

28:51.625 --> 28:52.836
So, Kyle,

28:53.213 --> 28:54.302
tell me,

28:54.593 --> 28:56.254
you ever go visit
your cousin, Shawn?

28:57.352 --> 28:59.296
Hasn't been much in the paper
about him lately.

29:00.065 --> 29:02.094
- Is he getting any better?
- No, he's not.

29:03.169 --> 29:04.302
Which is weird
cause the doctors say

29:04.402 --> 29:05.543
there's no reason
why he shouldn't be awake.

29:05.643 --> 29:07.735
His brain's active,
his vital signs are okay.

29:08.957 --> 29:10.083
That's so sad.

29:10.621 --> 29:12.029
He seemed like
a really good guy.

29:12.133 --> 29:13.654
Everyone's just given up.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.374
Settling in for the long haul.

29:18.061 --> 29:20.596
Didn't I read something
about the promicin in his system?

29:21.183 --> 29:22.799
The doctors think it's all out of whack?

29:22.899 --> 29:24.632
That's right.
They think that's why he...

29:25.511 --> 29:28.208
His body shut down but I don't think
that made it into the papers.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.324
Well, it must have.

29:29.755 --> 29:31.305
How else would I know about it?

29:34.136 --> 29:35.835
Okay, I know I'm not a doctor,

29:35.948 --> 29:38.573
but maybe someone
should try injecting him

29:38.673 --> 29:40.258
with a big old dose of promicin.

29:40.460 --> 29:42.309
It'd be like giving him
a jump start, right?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.170
Shawn's a 4400.

29:45.368 --> 29:47.654
- Probably wouldn't hurt him.
- I've thought about that.

29:48.911 --> 29:50.312
The doctors won't even consider it.

29:50.412 --> 29:51.940
Promicin is seriously illegal.

29:53.354 --> 29:55.476
Too bad you can't
get your hands on any.

29:56.534 --> 29:58.863
You might be the only person
in his life who cares enough

29:58.985 --> 30:01.211
to actually take a shot
at waking him up.

30:38.365 --> 30:41.426
They've just been standing here
staring at us for hours.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.091
Don't they ever have to
use the bathroom?

30:46.413 --> 30:47.526
Head's up.

30:50.336 --> 30:51.425
Don't shoot!

30:51.692 --> 30:53.488
My name's Graham Holt.
I want to surrender.

30:53.588 --> 30:54.857
It's about time.

30:55.077 --> 30:56.664
Hands up.
keep your hands up.

30:57.255 --> 30:58.739
All right, on your knees.

31:00.225 --> 31:01.238
Easy...

31:02.084 --> 31:03.126
It's not him!

31:03.380 --> 31:04.409
It's not holt!

31:04.509 --> 31:06.349
Don't shoot!
My name's Graham Holt.

31:06.537 --> 31:08.415
On your knees!
Now! On your knees!

31:10.403 --> 31:11.492
Don't shoot!

31:12.815 --> 31:13.989
I'm Graham Holt...

31:29.239 --> 31:30.324
Don't fight me.

31:30.638 --> 31:31.855
Join me.

32:02.173 --> 32:04.360
<i>Hey, everyone.
my name's Graham Holt.</i>

32:05.139 --> 32:06.510
<i>I just wanted to say,</i>

32:06.768 --> 32:08.280
<i>you have nothing
to be afraid of.</i>

32:09.056 --> 32:11.404
<i>Believing in me doesn't
make you a different person.</i>

32:11.855 --> 32:13.418
<i>You'll still love your family.</i>

32:13.563 --> 32:15.494
<i>You'll still wake up
in the morning</i>

32:15.594 --> 32:17.690
<i>and go do
whatever it is you do.</i>

32:18.329 --> 32:19.991
<i>You'll just have more purpose,</i>

32:20.369 --> 32:23.045
<i>and everyone will believe
exactly what you do,</i>

32:23.213 --> 32:24.725
<i>and you'll believe
what they do.</i>

32:26.545 --> 32:27.832
<i>It's all going to be very cool.</i>

32:28.216 --> 32:29.875
- <i>I promise.</i>
- She's gone.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.584
She must have left
in the middle of the night.

32:33.973 --> 32:35.429
Did you hear me?
She's gone.

32:38.821 --> 32:40.506
What are you doing?
We have to find her

32:40.606 --> 32:41.765
before someone picks her up.

32:42.802 --> 32:44.109
You'll have to go without me.

32:45.532 --> 32:47.698
What do you mean,
"go without you"?

32:47.798 --> 32:49.153
This is Tess. You owe her.

32:49.253 --> 32:51.025
I did not give out promicin
to the world

32:51.141 --> 32:54.400
to have it unite
under a 16-year-old boy.

32:55.986 --> 32:57.041
He has to be stopped.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.419
<i>It's all going to be very cool,
I promise.</i>

33:01.486 --> 33:02.519
I see.

33:03.655 --> 33:05.251
You're having messiah envy.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.790
How are you going to stop him,
Jordan?

33:09.852 --> 33:12.379
Anybody who gets near that kid
winds up praying to him.

33:12.479 --> 33:13.806
What makes you any different?

33:14.799 --> 33:16.446
And even if you could
get close to him,

33:16.568 --> 33:17.991
what do you expect to happen?

33:18.575 --> 33:19.618
A miracle?

33:20.557 --> 33:22.773
I guess I need one, don't I?

33:23.589 --> 33:25.242
<i>...you'll just have more purpose,</i>

33:25.594 --> 33:28.322
<i>and everyone will believe
exactly what you do,</i>

33:28.458 --> 33:30.017
<i>and you'll believe
what they do.</i>

33:31.815 --> 33:34.177
<i>It's all going to be very cool,
I promise.</i>

33:35.958 --> 33:38.098
Are you guys nuts?
I'm an NTAC agent!

33:38.211 --> 33:39.535
We're on the same side!

33:53.610 --> 33:55.028
Hey, come on, come on!

33:55.910 --> 33:57.094
Guys, guys...

34:00.901 --> 34:02.535
They're arresting
everybody at NTAC.

34:02.724 --> 34:04.058
What are you talking about?
Why?

34:04.158 --> 34:06.070
Our orders are
to bring you all downtown, sir.

34:06.326 --> 34:08.251
Graham wants to bring
NTAC into the fold.

34:10.231 --> 34:11.762
Fine. Fine. Sounds good.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.967
What choice do we have, huh?

34:16.159 --> 34:17.464
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.643
Graham converted
a couple of police stations.

34:19.817 --> 34:21.179
The cops are arresting people,

34:21.348 --> 34:22.869
bringing them to him
by the hundreds.

34:57.784 --> 34:59.924
I'm the king of Seattle!

35:08.592 --> 35:09.725
Why aren't you picking up
the phone?

35:09.825 --> 35:11.641
I told you it's dangerous
outside right now.

35:11.741 --> 35:12.766
Now, call me back.

35:13.776 --> 35:15.041
Still no word from your son?

35:15.141 --> 35:16.834
- No. What did D.C. say?
- Nothing good.

35:16.934 --> 35:18.850
They're already talking
acceptable losses,

35:18.953 --> 35:21.323
air strikes, sending
an army division into the city.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.898
They're gonna invade an american city?
Sounds a lot like civil war to me.

35:23.998 --> 35:26.231
I know. Best I could do
was buy us a couple hours.

35:26.331 --> 35:28.207
- To do what?
- We have to gather everyone from NTAC

35:28.307 --> 35:30.307
that hasn't been converted,
make our way downtown,

35:30.407 --> 35:32.107
fight our way downtown
if we have to.

35:32.397 --> 35:33.722
We'll try to get close to Graham.

35:33.822 --> 35:35.946
We'll see if we can get to him
before he gets to us.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.581
Oh, my god. Shawn!
What happened?

36:24.681 --> 36:27.343
I don't know. He was just lying there
and he started convulsing.

36:30.889 --> 36:31.997
Oh, my god...

36:44.070 --> 36:45.254
Hey, come on.

36:45.385 --> 36:47.629
Hey, Shawn. Hey...
Hey, it's us.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.380
It's Kyle.

36:50.884 --> 36:52.377
Say something if you're okay.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.002
Come on.

36:56.094 --> 36:57.095
Mom?

36:59.379 --> 37:00.571
How did I get here?

37:35.402 --> 37:36.482
Mr. Collier...

37:36.736 --> 37:38.294
You did the right thing
coming to me.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.986
It would've been a shame
if I had to track you down.

37:42.559 --> 37:44.624
Seems the world
is falling at your feet.

37:45.407 --> 37:46.618
I wanted to see why.

37:46.842 --> 37:47.873
Don't worry.

37:47.973 --> 37:50.044
Soon, it's all going to make
perfect sense to you.

37:57.454 --> 37:58.835
I gave you promicin.

37:59.473 --> 38:00.534
I can take it away.

38:18.915 --> 38:20.127
What did you do to me?

38:22.145 --> 38:23.507
I made you ordinary.

38:26.354 --> 38:27.998
Shoot him!
Shoot him now!

38:35.116 --> 38:36.759
The world
doesn't need you anymore.

38:37.989 --> 38:39.041
It has me.

38:47.761 --> 38:49.188
Get on with your lives.

39:15.940 --> 39:17.827
Graham shouldn't have converted
so many cops.

39:18.283 --> 39:20.261
One of his former followers
arrested him right there,

39:20.361 --> 39:21.427
on the steps of the courthouse.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.817
And there's no trace of promicin
in his system? Nothing?

39:24.040 --> 39:26.865
No, he's just a high school kid
with a lot to answer for.

39:27.125 --> 39:30.086
I guess we can all stop
wondering if Collier has an ability.

39:30.218 --> 39:31.496
He can neutralize promicin.

39:31.596 --> 39:32.604
I don't get it.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.005
Shawn never said anything about Collier
doing that to one of the original 4400.

39:36.637 --> 39:38.098
Maybe it doesn't work on them.

39:38.403 --> 39:40.374
Maybe he can only do it
to the extra crispies.

39:42.696 --> 39:43.995
Extra crispies,
you know, like,

39:44.095 --> 39:46.065
not the original recipe 4400?

39:46.342 --> 39:48.745
People who took the promicin shot
and then got an ability.

39:48.845 --> 39:49.856
So Collier...

39:50.282 --> 39:52.461
walked into what was essentially
an occupied Seattle,

39:52.561 --> 39:54.407
laid hands on this kid,
and solved a problem

39:54.507 --> 39:56.436
that had the entire
U.S. government in a panic.

39:56.536 --> 39:59.072
If I was sitting at home
watching this story on the 6:00 news,

39:59.172 --> 40:00.729
you want to know what I'd be thinking?

40:01.688 --> 40:03.275
People were praying
to the wrong guy.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.195
Collier just posted a message
on the Internet.

40:09.138 --> 40:10.668
<i>We all had a scare today.</i>

40:11.505 --> 40:13.218
<i>We'll have others
before we're done.</i>

40:15.624 --> 40:16.704
<i>We...</i>

40:17.720 --> 40:21.184
<i>We're walking a difficult
and a dangerous path,</i>

40:23.180 --> 40:24.796
<i>but we're walking it together.</i>

40:26.250 --> 40:28.757
<i>Whether you've chosen
to join me or not,</i>

40:29.961 --> 40:31.774
 we're all, every one of us,

40:32.229 --> 40:33.516
<i>making history now.</i>

40:34.763 --> 40:36.773
I got a call from the warden
at kurland prison.

40:37.099 --> 40:38.982
There's a message for you
from Isabelle Tyler.

40:41.102 --> 40:42.117
That's it?

40:42.548 --> 40:43.645
The Powell museum?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.323
She said your answer's there,

40:45.436 --> 40:46.936
and you'll know it
when you see it.

40:50.162 --> 40:52.181
<i>The time for
sitting on the fence is over.</i>

40:53.195 --> 40:55.289
<i>The time for greatness is now.</i>

40:56.050 --> 40:57.413
<i>Each of you has a role to play.</i>

40:57.513 --> 41:00.468
<i>Your only choice
is whether you accept it</i>

41:00.986 --> 41:02.422
<i>or have it thrust upon you.</i>

41:02.882 --> 41:04.901
<i>Promicin is out there.</i>

41:05.368 --> 41:06.532
<i>People are gaining abilities,</i>

41:06.632 --> 41:08.222
<i>and nothing can be done
about that...</i>

41:08.322 --> 41:10.714
I'm sorry, sir. There's no student
named Cassie Dunleavy

41:10.814 --> 41:12.954
- registered at this school...
- She said she's a student here.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.147
I really need to talk to her.

41:14.247 --> 41:16.117
Can't find in the phonebook
can't find her anywhere.

41:16.217 --> 41:17.957
Maybe she didn't give you
her real name.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.624
Have you thought of that?

41:20.719 --> 41:23.893
<i>The genie will not go back
into the bottle.</i>

41:24.479 --> 41:25.869
<i>I know it's tempting...</i>

41:26.174 --> 41:28.352
<i>to think that we can hold on
to the past,</i>

41:29.066 --> 41:31.573
<i>to everything
that's safe and easy,</i>

41:32.300 --> 41:33.558
<i>but we cannot,</i>

41:34.703 --> 41:35.914
<i>and safe and easy,</i>

41:36.066 --> 41:39.418
<i>are what set us on the path
to catastrophe in the first place.</i>

41:39.528 --> 41:41.584
<i>The chains of comfort...</i>

41:42.136 --> 41:45.110
<i>are what keep us from reaching
for a better world.</i>

41:45.902 --> 41:47.977
<i>This new era, it's not coming,</i>

41:48.167 --> 41:49.979
<i>it's not on the way,
it's here,</i>

41:51.901 --> 41:54.511
<i>and we are now separated
from our old lives</i>

41:55.892 --> 41:58.276
<i>by a gulf that can never again
be bridged.</i>

41:59.501 --> 42:01.379
<i>So all of you, out there,</i>

42:02.870 --> 42:04.603
<i>need to ask yourself one thing,</i>

42:07.311 --> 42:08.447
<i>are you ready?</i>
