00:00.887 --> 00:02.555
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.648 --> 00:04.863
- I'm Adam Baylin.
- What do you want from me?

00:05.118 --> 00:07.297
- What would you like to know?
- Everything.

00:07.576 --> 00:08.608
Are they your family?

00:08.851 --> 00:10.312
They were killed by a drunk driver.

00:10.701 --> 00:11.783
You were the drunk driver.

00:11.969 --> 00:13.731
She thinks that she's my sister.

00:13.919 --> 00:15.452
I'm just supposed to live that lie?

00:15.553 --> 00:17.831
She's the computer,
and her life is the program.

00:18.263 --> 00:20.463
I'm... Declan, by the way.

00:22.330 --> 00:24.452
Usually, that would be
where you'd say your name.

00:24.875 --> 00:25.878
Jessi.

00:26.585 --> 00:28.440
- I wanna break up.
- I doesn't matter anyway.

00:28.526 --> 00:29.797
I've already erased you.

00:29.970 --> 00:31.059
You and me? Done.

00:31.511 --> 00:32.520
Never happened.

00:33.478 --> 00:34.606
What is this?

00:34.787 --> 00:35.921
It's your new car.

00:36.025 --> 00:38.022
It doesn't run right now,
we're gonna fix it up.

00:38.131 --> 00:39.307
Kyle just read the manual.

00:39.820 --> 00:42.228
Since my dad died,
we've been having money troubles.

00:43.729 --> 00:45.984
- I have a job interview.
- What's the job?

00:46.262 --> 00:48.755
- Welcome to Madacorp.
- I can't wait to be part of the team.

00:49.148 --> 00:51.328
I'm gonna stay here
and see if I can help.

00:51.559 --> 00:52.568
Why would you do that?

00:53.611 --> 00:55.652
You think I'm just gonna
walk away from you now?

01:03.178 --> 01:05.343
People live much of
their lives in uncertainty.

01:06.216 --> 01:07.407
What might happen in a week...

01:08.254 --> 01:09.089
a month...

01:09.818 --> 01:10.719
a year.

01:12.244 --> 01:14.013
I wondered about my own life,

01:14.271 --> 01:17.145
if I would be able to answer
the questions had kept appearing.

01:18.029 --> 01:20.486
I guess, I, too,
was looking for certainty.

01:21.412 --> 01:22.679
It's a done deal.

01:22.773 --> 01:24.627
I'm scoring Dava Avina.

01:25.834 --> 01:26.909
She looks nice.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.989
Kittens are nice.

01:29.446 --> 01:30.461
Dava's...

01:31.593 --> 01:33.587
Well, hopefully, she's not nice.

01:34.613 --> 01:37.617
I thought you two were just
study partners for biology lab.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.173
It may have started there,

01:39.282 --> 01:40.854
but I knew we were destined for more.

01:41.286 --> 01:42.356
You see, Kyle,

01:42.789 --> 01:44.521
women are attracted to success.

01:44.708 --> 01:46.186
They can't resist it.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.269
And in high school,
success means... a car.

01:51.339 --> 01:54.324
Boys, life is not like a rap video.

01:54.588 --> 01:56.524
Having a pimped out car
doesn't guarantee

01:56.641 --> 01:58.496
your hand gets anywhere near her bra.

01:58.870 --> 01:59.879
If she wears one.

02:00.590 --> 02:03.123
What is with boys and breasts?

02:05.071 --> 02:06.301
Don't side with her, buddy.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.831
You're breaking a sacred bond.

02:09.923 --> 02:11.773
- I'm Andy.
- Kyle.

02:11.946 --> 02:14.150
I'm in the middle of teaching
Kyle about life and love.

02:14.236 --> 02:16.051
Then I am thwarting a great injustice.

02:16.832 --> 02:19.031
Let me set you straight on
what girls actually like.

02:19.775 --> 02:20.830
I want you...

02:21.248 --> 02:22.870
to remember this moment.

02:26.685 --> 02:28.279
"Remember this moment."

02:28.913 --> 02:31.130
The words triggered something,
and suddenly...

02:31.348 --> 02:33.168
I saw things that
shouldn't have been there.

02:34.593 --> 02:35.764
A fishbowl.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.385
A postcard.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.916
And the urn that contained
Adam Baylin's ashes.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.438 --> 02:55.438
You okay, dude?

03:03.099 --> 03:04.101
Kyle, you all right?

03:09.109 --> 03:11.066
I feel like something bad
is about to happen.

03:38.143 --> 03:40.032
I got two words for you...

03:40.583 --> 03:42.194
"Lottery ticket."

04:02.164 --> 04:04.710
- Hey, you guys okay?
- Awesome.

04:05.124 --> 04:07.720
Our little alien can predict the future.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.187
You should see The Rack.

04:11.432 --> 04:13.560
It's not the place I would call
earthquake friendly.

04:13.644 --> 04:14.809
Then what are you doing home?

04:14.904 --> 04:16.279
Checking out my ride for damage.

04:16.370 --> 04:19.113
You should check your room.
It looks like it was hit pretty hard.

04:20.005 --> 04:21.701
No, it was like that before.

04:25.115 --> 04:26.982
Did Josh think you predicted
the earthquake?

04:29.485 --> 04:31.446
I had a feeling something bad
was gonna happen.

04:32.371 --> 04:33.834
And then everything started shaking.

04:34.987 --> 04:38.316
You know, certain animals seem
to anticipate natural disasters.

04:38.412 --> 04:41.251
It's not out of the realm
of scientific possibility.

04:43.081 --> 04:44.347
Is there something else?

04:45.842 --> 04:47.555
I saw some things.

04:47.731 --> 04:48.951
What things?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.244
Things that were there...

04:53.345 --> 04:54.635
and then weren't.

04:55.186 --> 04:56.995
Like I was dreaming,
except I was awake.

04:57.911 --> 04:59.977
Sounds like you had some sort of vision.

05:00.773 --> 05:01.782
A vision.

05:02.943 --> 05:03.942
Is that normal?

05:05.235 --> 05:08.531
I think we need to expand our definition
of normal when it comes to you.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.115
I need the right shirt for tomorrow.

05:10.479 --> 05:11.851
You're choosing already?

05:11.933 --> 05:13.435
It's my first big day.

05:15.118 --> 05:17.687
Well, you want confident,
but not overbearing.

05:26.379 --> 05:27.379
Thank you.

05:28.209 --> 05:29.213
You're welcome.

05:30.145 --> 05:31.247
I like the green.

05:31.341 --> 05:33.959
It's perfect for the brilliant new guy
in the software division.

05:34.052 --> 05:35.053
Right.

05:35.706 --> 05:38.603
Look, I know I've been
stressed out looking for work.

05:38.732 --> 05:40.291
Things have been a little shaky lately.

05:40.679 --> 05:43.270
I've been a little shaky myself.
And for a lot longer than you.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.125
I think I can cut you some slack.

05:46.903 --> 05:48.602
I think the future's looking up for me.

05:48.838 --> 05:50.322
We're gonna be just fine.

05:51.008 --> 05:52.849
You're totally screwed.

05:53.666 --> 05:54.793
You're exaggerating.

05:54.886 --> 05:56.012
You couldn't be more screwed

05:56.092 --> 05:58.017
if you were between
a wall and a Phillips head.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.849
I'm golden. I shoot from the hip.

06:01.123 --> 06:02.588
Girls like spontaneity in a man.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.099
Girls like a plan.

06:04.336 --> 06:06.839
Spontaneity is code for
"I couldn't be bothered."

06:10.329 --> 06:11.332
Then what about bowling?

06:12.222 --> 06:13.222
Or...

06:13.306 --> 06:15.993
we could look for something
that doesn't scream "seventh grader".

06:17.007 --> 06:18.007
Next.

06:24.069 --> 06:25.525
I can't believe I'm doing this.

06:25.930 --> 06:26.930
What?

06:29.731 --> 06:31.377
For the good of our species,

06:31.746 --> 06:33.172
I'll help you plan your first date.

06:36.157 --> 06:37.865
Look, you said I've been kissed before.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.849
Yes, I have. Many times.

06:42.572 --> 06:44.895
Maybe this isn't the best idea for you.

06:45.918 --> 06:47.394
How can you watch that?

06:47.579 --> 06:48.933
Let's not think about that.

06:49.073 --> 06:50.074
I like it.

06:50.156 --> 06:52.088
My heart pounds like a drum
when you're near.

06:53.388 --> 06:54.557
I can feel it.

06:55.419 --> 06:57.034
Take me away from here...

06:57.541 --> 06:58.603
to a place where we...

06:59.049 --> 07:00.756
Remember your appointment today.

07:05.022 --> 07:07.933
- You have a session this afternoon.
- All right. I'll be there.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.465
Then kiss me.

07:13.465 --> 07:15.188
Don't make me ask again.

07:18.270 --> 07:19.840
I don't know how else to explain it.

07:20.393 --> 07:21.701
Predict the future.

07:22.162 --> 07:23.485
I know it sounds weird.

07:24.701 --> 07:26.470
Who knows what you can do?

07:28.023 --> 07:29.023
We should...

07:29.224 --> 07:30.628
We should check Baylin's notes

07:30.917 --> 07:32.763
and see if he documented
anything about this.

07:33.840 --> 07:34.840
All right.

07:35.164 --> 07:37.240
That phrase that you solved,
"Viz Allati"?

07:37.518 --> 07:39.256
It's Hungarian.
It means "underwater".

07:39.810 --> 07:40.902
You looked it up?

07:41.317 --> 07:42.320
No, I just know it.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.401
Since when could you speak Hungarian?

07:53.024 --> 07:54.440
Lori, here.

07:59.105 --> 08:00.105
That was for you.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.268
Open mic night?

08:03.691 --> 08:04.804
I just started playing.

08:05.002 --> 08:06.238
I've heard you. You're good.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.768
- How do you know?
- I live next door to you, remember?

08:08.848 --> 08:10.815
I hear everything that
comes out of your bedroom.

08:12.115 --> 08:13.115
Awesome.

08:13.524 --> 08:15.337
Take it from someone
who knows a thing or two

08:15.426 --> 08:17.728
about getting their heart
torn out and stomped on.

08:18.470 --> 08:19.638
You need to vent.

08:20.454 --> 08:22.070
I'm serious about open mic night.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.458
Singing about your heartache
could be very therapeutic.

08:28.961 --> 08:29.992
Technology.

08:30.223 --> 08:31.223
Science.

08:31.377 --> 08:32.376
Art.

08:32.592 --> 08:35.734
Only one company integrates all three

08:35.957 --> 08:38.066
for the benefit of mankind.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.914
Madacorp.

08:40.328 --> 08:43.745
Ground-breaking research
for tomorrow's solutions.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.599
Madacorp.

08:45.861 --> 08:48.676
Building foundations for tomorrow.

08:50.461 --> 08:51.569
Technology.

08:51.816 --> 08:52.877
Science.

08:53.062 --> 08:54.062
Art.

08:54.215 --> 08:57.396
Only one company integrates all three

08:57.552 --> 08:59.446
for the benefit of mankind.

09:34.737 --> 09:36.829
My mom's been working
really hard, but...

09:37.352 --> 09:39.306
we still had to make some sacrifices.

09:40.428 --> 09:42.105
The car and the piano were mine.

09:44.074 --> 09:45.320
You two are in it together.

09:46.197 --> 09:47.289
Which is nice, but...

09:47.643 --> 09:50.395
it would be nicer if I knew things
were gonna get better soon.

09:50.751 --> 09:51.753
It will.

09:52.535 --> 09:53.788
You know that for a fact?

09:56.044 --> 09:57.890
Do you think it's possible
somebody could?

09:58.782 --> 10:00.165
It would be cool, wouldn't it?

10:00.724 --> 10:03.874
If I knew everything was gonna turn out
okay, I could deal with the bad.

10:04.341 --> 10:06.567
It's not knowing that drives you crazy.

10:07.242 --> 10:09.691
So predicting the future
could be a good thing.

10:09.795 --> 10:12.575
Sure. I mean, I guess
you'd never be surprised.

10:12.669 --> 10:13.862
And, believe me,

10:13.969 --> 10:16.039
lately surprises aren't
all their cracked up to be.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.332
There you go.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.521
Anything for the Tragers?

10:22.607 --> 10:23.789
Let me check.

10:29.351 --> 10:31.263
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

10:31.623 --> 10:32.682
See you later.

10:33.079 --> 10:34.083
See you.

11:01.983 --> 11:02.990
Hi.

11:03.090 --> 11:04.107
Hey.

11:05.555 --> 11:06.558
Come in.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.776
How's the date training going?

11:11.437 --> 11:14.578
Let's just say I'm making the world
safer for ovaries everywhere.

11:15.538 --> 11:17.109
It's nice of you to help him.

11:17.507 --> 11:19.872
Oh, it's not nice.
It's a public service.

11:19.986 --> 11:21.598
I mean, he's a walking disaster.

11:21.692 --> 11:23.295
He doesn't have a clue about women.

11:23.408 --> 11:26.967
This girl he's after?
She's not the sharpest tool in the shed.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.483
And his sense of humor?
Sort of specific. So, strike one.

11:29.586 --> 11:31.431
She's not gonna notice how funny he is.

11:31.545 --> 11:33.385
Strike two are those T-shirts he wears.

11:33.688 --> 11:35.447
I'm a T-shirt girl, so I get it.

11:35.546 --> 11:37.477
But that Dava person?

11:37.674 --> 11:40.285
Can I just say, we're gonna need
an extreme makeover.

11:40.822 --> 11:43.917
- Is there a strike three?
- He doesn't know how to talk to girls.

11:44.013 --> 11:46.889
I guarantee you...
he brings up on-line gaming,

11:47.647 --> 11:49.246
and he's a virgin till he's 30.

11:49.359 --> 11:50.539
But you like on-line gaming.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.723
Yeah, well, he's not going
on a date with me.

11:52.804 --> 11:54.109
Sounds like he should be.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.631
Um... ew?

12:00.105 --> 12:01.392
Did you find anything?

12:01.487 --> 12:02.547
Nothing yet.

12:07.930 --> 12:10.633
What would you do
if you could predict the future?

12:11.936 --> 12:13.866
Wished I could have done it sooner.

12:20.211 --> 12:22.142
Will you tell me about them?

12:25.463 --> 12:26.787
Your wife and daughter.

12:30.213 --> 12:31.216
Keep looking.

12:50.047 --> 12:51.050
Hello.

12:53.225 --> 12:54.357
Hello.

12:54.955 --> 12:56.242
Um, can I help you?

12:56.356 --> 12:58.135
Oh, Nicole's expecting me.

12:59.098 --> 13:00.727
Oh, well, her office is this way.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.326
I know.

13:03.822 --> 13:05.771
We haven't officially met. I'm Lori.

13:06.546 --> 13:07.549
Jessi.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.124
I know you're new in town, so...

13:10.581 --> 13:12.755
let me know if you need anything.

13:13.349 --> 13:14.371
What would I need?

13:15.715 --> 13:18.440
I could fill you in
on all things Seattle.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.766
People to know, places to see.

13:22.443 --> 13:25.358
Like I... I saw you hanging out
with Declan McDonough.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.836
He and I used to be very close, so...

13:28.168 --> 13:30.771
if you have any questions,
I could answer them for you.

13:30.931 --> 13:33.391
- Questions?
- He can be like any guy.

13:34.093 --> 13:37.016
A real ass when he puts
his mind to it, in fact, but...

13:38.075 --> 13:40.853
under all that I can tell you
he's got a really good heart.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.363
Does your heart pound
like a drum when he's near?

13:50.305 --> 13:51.307
Jessi.

13:51.970 --> 13:53.503
I didn't hear you come in.

13:54.352 --> 13:55.355
That's okay.

13:55.469 --> 13:57.529
Uh, shall we head to my office?

14:10.210 --> 14:12.519
This car is gonna be a babe mobile.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.577
Like money in the bank. Ka-ching.

14:17.703 --> 14:18.706
What?

14:19.211 --> 14:20.215
Nothing.

14:21.114 --> 14:22.268
Back to work.

14:22.503 --> 14:24.878
You get to the house. What do you do?

14:25.108 --> 14:27.474
Easy. Roll up, honk the horn.

14:27.961 --> 14:28.964
Stop.

14:29.426 --> 14:31.073
You give your date the beep-beep,

14:31.183 --> 14:34.533
and the only person you'll have running
out of the house will be her dad...

14:34.632 --> 14:35.976
to pound on you.

14:36.597 --> 14:39.057
You go to the door.
Attempt to be cool.

14:39.740 --> 14:40.857
I knew that.

14:43.298 --> 14:45.702
Now, she's in the car.
Show me what you're gonna do.

14:45.808 --> 14:47.114
What? With you?

14:47.468 --> 14:51.060
If you can't do it with me, how are you
gonna do it with a real girl?

14:51.427 --> 14:52.430
I mean...

14:53.452 --> 14:54.872
You know what I mean.

14:54.966 --> 14:55.969
Come on.

14:56.315 --> 14:57.961
Pretend I'm your date.

15:00.517 --> 15:03.100
Look, I'm the irresistible Dava.

15:03.734 --> 15:05.002
Make your move.

15:14.952 --> 15:17.356
I don't even know why I bother with you.

15:17.469 --> 15:18.642
It's the car.

15:21.614 --> 15:23.393
Let me ask you a question.

15:23.677 --> 15:25.381
Why did you ask her out?

15:25.627 --> 15:28.067
It can't just be because of her boobs.

15:28.203 --> 15:30.607
Oh, my God. It was.

15:34.428 --> 15:35.469
You okay?

15:36.756 --> 15:38.935
Yeah. Your stupid just...

15:39.389 --> 15:41.445
sucked all the air outta the car.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.243
Here, I'll get the window.

15:48.957 --> 15:49.960
Josh?

15:50.452 --> 15:51.664
You get fired already?

15:52.849 --> 15:55.442
I'm just grabbing some software
and then I'm heading back.

15:55.578 --> 15:56.679
Well, times have changed.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.679
None of my dates ever helped me
get my car running beforehand.

16:00.341 --> 16:01.868
Dad, this isn't my date.

16:01.981 --> 16:03.098
It's just Andy.

16:03.193 --> 16:05.251
- Oh, well, hi, there.
- Hello.

16:05.342 --> 16:08.076
She's helping me polish my game
to a mirror-like shine.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.331
Well, we better put some time
in this thing, otherwise...

16:11.464 --> 16:14.272
your date, whoever she is,
will be riding your handlebars.

16:21.379 --> 16:22.902
We've been at this for hours.

16:22.997 --> 16:25.610
Baylin didn't record anything
about premonitions.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.117
This is useless.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.892
When I touched the book,
I found myself in another vision.

16:37.211 --> 16:39.615
But this time instead of Baylin's urn,

16:39.902 --> 16:41.473
I saw the man himself.

17:04.013 --> 17:05.207
What happened?

17:06.449 --> 17:07.829
What did you see?

17:09.193 --> 17:10.385
Adam was there.

17:11.786 --> 17:12.789
Baylin?

17:13.382 --> 17:14.556
He gave me this.

17:14.991 --> 17:16.278
You wrote that.

17:17.506 --> 17:20.400
You walked over here, you picked up
the pad and you wrote that yourself.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.897
Well, it's definitely your handwriting.

17:45.293 --> 17:47.055
You must have sent it to yourself.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.956
- Forgotten I sent it?
- You must have been

17:49.050 --> 17:52.419
in some kind of altered state, like
before when you said you saw Baylin.

17:52.533 --> 17:55.083
But why send myself
something so cryptic?

17:55.632 --> 17:57.604
Why not just write
what I knew was coming?

17:57.699 --> 17:59.525
We may be looking at this
in the wrong angle.

17:59.638 --> 18:01.607
What if you're not seeing the future?

18:02.048 --> 18:05.393
It could be your subconscious trying
to tell you something, from your past.

18:05.533 --> 18:08.918
The things that you're seeing, they
could be symbols for something else.

18:09.009 --> 18:10.516
Nicole called them visions.

18:10.686 --> 18:11.689
You're...

18:12.697 --> 18:15.139
talking to her about this? You can't!

18:16.982 --> 18:19.422
I am the only one that you can trust.

18:19.968 --> 18:23.971
If you have a question or you need to
talk about something, you come to me.

18:24.587 --> 18:25.988
I'm just confused.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.825
Why is this happening to me now?

18:30.036 --> 18:32.082
Well, we've been working hard,
making progress,

18:32.190 --> 18:34.585
maybe your mind had to reach
a certain level of control

18:34.680 --> 18:35.672
before these...

18:36.642 --> 18:38.290
visions could present themselves.

18:40.254 --> 18:42.156
The important thing now
is trying to figure out

18:42.289 --> 18:44.961
what the message is that you're
trying to send to yourself.

18:45.056 --> 18:46.525
I just hope we can.

18:46.619 --> 18:48.397
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

18:48.477 --> 18:50.215
I feel like I can't trust
anything I see.

18:55.281 --> 18:56.568
No, that's real.

18:57.457 --> 18:59.437
And it's really out of tune.

19:20.267 --> 19:21.971
And your eyes are where?

19:22.103 --> 19:24.240
On her face. Not her chest.

19:25.992 --> 19:27.582
What are the three L's?

19:27.671 --> 19:29.356
Listen, listen, listen.

19:31.288 --> 19:32.927
And at the end of the night?

19:33.021 --> 19:34.119
Feel her up.

19:35.025 --> 19:36.615
Kidding. Feel it out,

19:36.865 --> 19:38.729
and if the moment seems right,

19:38.823 --> 19:39.826
kiss her.

19:40.959 --> 19:41.999
No tongue.

19:43.501 --> 19:46.208
I guess you're as good
as you're gonna get.

19:47.890 --> 19:48.931
Hey, Andy?

19:51.290 --> 19:52.445
Thanks for everything.

19:54.981 --> 19:56.438
Just don't blow it.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.998
This is a one-time charitable donation.

20:20.423 --> 20:21.431
Can I sit?

20:22.196 --> 20:23.324
Sure.

20:27.853 --> 20:31.812
So, I think we've hit the end of
our break-up drama shelf life.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.972
Proper exchanges, avoiding eye contact,

20:35.199 --> 20:36.199
all that.

20:36.352 --> 20:38.213
It's getting kind of tedious. So,

20:38.391 --> 20:40.775
I just wanted to say
that I'm done, and...

20:40.904 --> 20:43.677
we should be able to inhabit
each others' space drama-free.

20:44.441 --> 20:45.417
That's good.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.114
And we should be able to talk
like two civilized people.

20:50.627 --> 20:52.043
And if we're talking and everything,

20:52.123 --> 20:54.327
then I should be able to warn
you about Crazytown.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.004
- Crazytown?
- Oh, come on.

20:57.559 --> 20:59.341
New hot patient of my mom's.

20:59.665 --> 21:02.785
I have seen the sparkage and
I know how you boys like the crazies.

21:02.933 --> 21:05.687
Is this the part where you...
say we should still be friends?

21:06.084 --> 21:08.558
If so, your lead-in kind of sucks.

21:09.780 --> 21:11.341
I'm sorry. I'm being...

21:11.858 --> 21:13.400
exactly the kind of girl that I hate.

21:15.245 --> 21:18.454
Let's start over. I'm Lori Trager,
passive aggressive mean girl.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.524
Declan McDonough,

21:22.028 --> 21:23.331
crazy-chick magnet.

21:24.757 --> 21:26.196
I guess I walked into that one.

21:31.496 --> 21:32.615
I'm playing tonight.

21:33.234 --> 21:34.323
You should come.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.676
Are all your songs going to be about
the cruelty of teenage boys?

21:42.405 --> 21:44.616
You're supposed to write
from experience.

22:01.177 --> 22:02.841
- Hi.
- I've got to run.

22:03.003 --> 22:05.343
I just want to make sure
you're coming to open mic night.

22:05.816 --> 22:06.851
Are you playing, too?

22:07.185 --> 22:09.114
No, I'm running the soundboard.

22:09.404 --> 22:10.405
They're paying me, so...

22:10.501 --> 22:13.330
it'll get me one step closer
to getting another piano.

22:13.821 --> 22:15.667
I'm all messed up without one.

22:16.103 --> 22:18.088
And playing the piano unmesses you.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.271
When I play,

22:22.816 --> 22:25.863
everything that drags me down
and distracts me disappears.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.146
Music brings me clarity.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.766
Clarity.

22:32.429 --> 22:33.744
I could use some of that.

22:34.402 --> 22:35.607
Couldn't we all?

22:36.198 --> 22:38.126
- So will you be there?
- I will.

22:38.759 --> 22:40.335
Great, then I'll see you.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.439
If music helped Amanda,

22:45.724 --> 22:47.406
maybe that's what I needed

22:47.623 --> 22:48.739
to shed my distractions and

22:48.848 --> 22:51.254
better understand
the visions I'd been having.

23:07.396 --> 23:08.868
So, have you thought about...

23:09.090 --> 23:10.577
what you want to do with your life?

23:11.401 --> 23:12.402
What do you mean?

23:13.256 --> 23:15.408
Well, have you thought
about your future?

23:15.807 --> 23:16.877
My future?

23:17.907 --> 23:19.163
No, not really.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.652
Jessi, your parents may not have always
made the best choices for you, but...

23:24.901 --> 23:26.167
you can change that now.

23:27.094 --> 23:28.537
You make your own choices.

23:46.974 --> 23:49.252
I was amazed by what I was seeing.

23:49.914 --> 23:53.416
They were my memories cataloged of
everything since I'd left the pod.

23:54.565 --> 23:56.464
I had developed a new ability.

23:57.318 --> 23:59.501
I had complete control over my memories.

24:15.182 --> 24:17.605
I want you to remember this moment.

24:18.622 --> 24:20.986
Those were the words
that started my visions.

24:21.951 --> 24:23.688
What was the moment
I needed to remember?

24:29.225 --> 24:30.686
I want you to remember this moment.

24:31.418 --> 24:32.420
That was it.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.697
Remember this moment.

24:36.687 --> 24:37.896
After I'm gone,

24:38.052 --> 24:40.924
all of my experiences, everything
that I've studied and learned,

24:41.051 --> 24:42.051
will be yours.

24:43.508 --> 24:44.693
You're special, Kyle.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.845
You see the world from
a unique perspective.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.422
Your mind's a powerful tool.

24:56.529 --> 24:57.531
Protect it.

25:02.315 --> 25:04.908
I discovered not only
could I relive my memories,

25:05.792 --> 25:07.495
I could actually move within them,

25:07.942 --> 25:10.999
allowing me to view any moment
from anywhere I wanted.

25:11.284 --> 25:12.286
Protect it.

25:13.669 --> 25:14.685
Use it wisely.

25:15.612 --> 25:17.853
It was the book
I had touched at the warehouse.

25:18.632 --> 25:21.076
I realized that Baylin
had hidden something inside.

25:21.547 --> 25:23.329
You're more important than your mind.

25:23.770 --> 25:25.434
It's your soul that touches people.

26:13.482 --> 26:15.868
All of my memories
had led me to this disc,

26:16.603 --> 26:18.781
but Adam's message still eluded me.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.183
Foss, I need to talk to you.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.387
It's important.

26:48.598 --> 26:50.438
Those things can be a real pain.

26:50.769 --> 26:52.843
I think the new guy just
can't work the door.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.271
Maybe you're just punching in
the wrong numbers.

26:55.371 --> 26:57.123
Well, they wrote them down for me here.

26:58.522 --> 27:00.509
Well, is that one a four or a nine?

27:00.671 --> 27:01.864
It's a four, right?

27:02.542 --> 27:04.397
Says the man who can't open the door.

27:09.167 --> 27:10.962
Thanks. I'm Emily, by the way.

27:11.058 --> 27:13.414
Stephen, and, uh, thanks.

27:14.017 --> 27:15.019
Don't worry about it.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.492
Look, let me take you to the lunchroom.

27:17.625 --> 27:18.759
Coffee machine in there,

27:18.929 --> 27:21.093
now that's the real test
of intelligence.

27:23.081 --> 27:24.465
I love that shade of green.

27:40.485 --> 27:41.663
Sorry I'm late.

27:42.281 --> 27:43.654
It's not quite purring yet, huh?

27:43.768 --> 27:45.273
More like coughing up hairballs.

27:47.191 --> 27:49.570
Well, just a few more tweaks,
we're almost there.

27:54.104 --> 27:55.252
I remember my first time.

27:56.092 --> 27:57.108
Gross, Dad.

27:57.933 --> 27:59.508
I meant date, Josh.

28:01.953 --> 28:04.676
Jenny Marie, she wore those...
Daisy Dukes.

28:04.853 --> 28:07.621
Despite further mental images
I'll have to purge,

28:08.260 --> 28:09.259
what happened?

28:10.139 --> 28:11.959
Nothing, really.
It wasn't that great.

28:13.216 --> 28:14.219
Why wasn't it great?

28:15.425 --> 28:16.774
Well, I don't know.

28:18.409 --> 28:19.843
There was just no...

28:20.892 --> 28:21.962
tap.

28:23.199 --> 28:25.473
- Tap?
- When I first took your mother out.

28:25.593 --> 28:27.492
Uh, define "tap" please.

28:27.742 --> 28:28.801
You know, my foot.

28:30.136 --> 28:31.733
When I first took out your mother,

28:32.384 --> 28:33.912
there was just this...

28:34.529 --> 28:36.487
excitement, and...

28:37.149 --> 28:38.474
in the middle of dinner, I...

28:38.893 --> 28:41.647
realized my foot just kept tapping.

28:43.150 --> 28:44.379
Look, all I'm saying is,

28:45.020 --> 28:46.905
every guy has the idea
of a perfect date,

28:47.023 --> 28:50.482
but the truth is, the right fit
isn't always what you expect.

28:52.268 --> 28:53.299
Go ahead, try it again.

29:04.459 --> 29:05.722
We need E.T.

29:10.628 --> 29:12.248
Not to put any pressure on you,

29:12.439 --> 29:14.789
but it's a 117 minutes
before I take my first step

29:14.883 --> 29:16.401
into the great dating game of life.

29:17.808 --> 29:18.771
Try it.

29:28.752 --> 29:30.121
You forgot to open the fuel valve.

29:30.691 --> 29:32.065
It's always right in front of you.

29:32.168 --> 29:35.127
Who cares? It's alive!

29:42.091 --> 29:44.388
I made your favorite, spaghetti.

29:44.756 --> 29:45.904
I miss Mom's.

29:52.971 --> 29:54.178
I'll just be a sec.

29:59.988 --> 30:01.460
I know, sweetie.

30:02.229 --> 30:04.129
Mommy will make you dinner
tomorrow night.

30:06.379 --> 30:09.433
Yeah, I know that I promised
it would be tonight, but...

30:09.773 --> 30:11.344
Mommy has to work late.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.068
Tell you what.

30:15.364 --> 30:17.978
I will come by and tuck you in, so...

30:18.165 --> 30:19.769
pick out a book with Grandma.

30:22.086 --> 30:24.173
Yeah, of course, any book.

30:26.380 --> 30:28.236
All right. Two books.

30:30.586 --> 30:31.859
I love you, too.

30:32.343 --> 30:34.166
All right.
See you soon.

30:45.105 --> 30:46.422
Who were you talking to?

30:46.597 --> 30:48.354
Ah, just someone from work.

30:53.582 --> 30:56.361
Here you go.
Jess, I have to leave for a while.

30:57.196 --> 30:59.560
You stay here.
Don't leave the apartment.

31:01.550 --> 31:02.956
Mushrooms are good.

31:03.714 --> 31:05.504
- What?
- Mushrooms.

31:05.734 --> 31:07.283
I thought I didn't like them.

31:08.258 --> 31:11.146
Remember? They were on my pizza
at my ninth birthday. I got sick?

31:11.234 --> 31:12.596
Mom said I was allergic.

31:14.244 --> 31:15.826
Well, then I guess you are.

31:16.254 --> 31:18.681
Then why can I have them
on the spaghetti now?

31:21.087 --> 31:22.614
People change, Jess.

31:23.793 --> 31:25.058
I can change.

31:25.660 --> 31:27.124
I can choose for myself now.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.210
Some things, yes.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.751
Other things are decided for you.

31:33.877 --> 31:35.906
You stay in the apartment.

31:36.484 --> 31:37.762
Is that clear?

31:42.454 --> 31:43.450
Got it.

32:05.864 --> 32:08.901
"Viz Allati" means "underwater".

32:10.655 --> 32:12.069
Underwater.

32:14.552 --> 32:15.733
Underwater.

32:47.338 --> 32:48.543
Underwater.

32:55.547 --> 32:57.956
Using parts from Josh's car radio,

32:58.166 --> 33:00.379
I designed a way to play the CD.

33:01.005 --> 33:03.525
A way Adam knew only I could figure out.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.918
Kyle, if you're listening to this,

33:06.152 --> 33:07.811
you've passed a critical test.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.824
Here is your reward.

33:12.182 --> 33:13.854
Memories are important.

33:14.653 --> 33:17.376
When I knew that I would not
always be here to guide you,

33:18.415 --> 33:20.349
I knew I'd need a way to communicate,

33:21.194 --> 33:23.567
in order to share my experiences,

33:24.463 --> 33:26.037
and more importantly,

33:26.541 --> 33:28.902
assure you that you would
never be alone.

33:31.949 --> 33:33.671
This is the beginning, Kyle.

33:35.281 --> 33:37.062
Your holographic memory

33:37.382 --> 33:39.583
will become an important
power to master.

33:40.677 --> 33:42.865
The ability to explore
your memories will allow you

33:42.951 --> 33:44.906
to see things that others...

33:45.236 --> 33:46.330
and even you,

33:46.441 --> 33:47.560
have missed.

33:48.465 --> 33:50.223
So study the past, Kyle...

33:51.416 --> 33:53.837
and understand that all of the answers

33:54.219 --> 33:56.609
are already hidden in front of you.

34:00.690 --> 34:03.149
At first I was relieved
to have the answer,

34:03.666 --> 34:05.713
but then something struck me as odd.

34:07.194 --> 34:09.886
Why all that work
for such a simple message?

34:13.960 --> 34:16.088
Any premonitions about my date?

34:16.197 --> 34:17.772
Why? Are you nervous?

34:18.399 --> 34:21.534
Andy says nervousness is
the last refuge for the unprepared.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.402
Sounds like her.

34:23.969 --> 34:25.161
You look nice.

34:26.723 --> 34:29.132
Andy says this color
looks good with my eyes.

34:30.906 --> 34:33.922
You know, once you get past
the smart-ass remarks and references

34:34.021 --> 34:36.376
that I have to Google to understand...

34:37.333 --> 34:39.362
- she's...
- Pretty great?

34:44.297 --> 34:46.326
Anyway, about tonight.

34:46.634 --> 34:47.925
Predict my future.

34:48.072 --> 34:49.658
Think I'll get lucky?

34:50.051 --> 34:52.190
I think you already are.

34:53.260 --> 34:55.275
You're starting to sound
like a Hallmark card.

35:00.525 --> 35:02.224
- Is that for...
- Yes.

35:03.073 --> 35:04.917
It's very sweet.

35:06.097 --> 35:08.212
- Good luck, little brother.
- You, too.

35:14.608 --> 35:16.563
We better go, too.
We're gonna be late.

35:16.759 --> 35:18.541
Where did you find a piano?

35:38.562 --> 35:39.644
Here.

35:40.898 --> 35:42.177
I'll be right back.

35:49.343 --> 35:52.245
You look very singer/songwriter.

35:52.540 --> 35:54.175
There are a lot of people here.

35:54.581 --> 35:56.259
Fifty doesn't exactly constitute a...

35:56.389 --> 35:58.724
Okay, so it's not a stadium.
But still, I don't wanna,

35:58.810 --> 36:00.273
you know, suck.

36:00.420 --> 36:01.589
You won't suck.

36:01.736 --> 36:04.552
If you get nervous, just look over at me
and remember how mad you are.

36:04.650 --> 36:05.966
It'll be a nice distraction.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.397
I'm not mad at you, anymore.

36:09.507 --> 36:10.552
No?

36:10.664 --> 36:11.709
No.

36:12.041 --> 36:13.344
Shelf life, remember?

36:14.483 --> 36:15.516
Cool.

36:45.220 --> 36:47.592
Oh my god.
You did the beep-beep thing, didn't you?

36:47.691 --> 36:49.179
I didn't beep. I knocked.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.367
And then I waited.

36:51.465 --> 36:53.642
And then I sat on the porch
for another 20 minutes.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.166
You got stood up?

36:55.498 --> 36:56.591
Seems so.

36:57.165 --> 36:59.818
And since we didn't exactly
cover that part in out training,

36:59.898 --> 37:01.628
I thought maybe...

37:01.757 --> 37:02.790
Wait here.

37:15.924 --> 37:17.178
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

37:17.264 --> 37:19.044
You're not gonna kick her ass, are you?

37:19.124 --> 37:20.141
No.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.297
But I planned the perfect first date,

37:22.421 --> 37:24.511
and no way in hell is it going to waste.

37:25.188 --> 37:27.167
You're going on my date with me?

37:27.463 --> 37:28.791
It's my date now.

37:30.451 --> 37:31.926
Does that mean you're buying?

37:32.405 --> 37:33.451
Come on.

37:43.037 --> 37:44.537
Okay, this is it.

37:44.955 --> 37:46.012
Don't worry.

37:49.591 --> 37:50.599
Perfect.

37:52.222 --> 37:53.267
Hello.

37:55.061 --> 37:56.303
Hi.

37:57.052 --> 37:58.159
I met you.

37:59.204 --> 38:00.531
I remember.

38:02.843 --> 38:04.146
I asked about you.

38:05.421 --> 38:06.871
What did you find out?

38:08.986 --> 38:10.376
That you have a good heart.

38:12.589 --> 38:13.892
Want to feel mine?

38:16.178 --> 38:18.564
This is definitely a sign
that I should not play tonight.

38:19.732 --> 38:20.858
Why do you think that?

38:21.330 --> 38:23.550
Because I wrote a song about...

38:24.731 --> 38:26.133
And he's with...

38:26.305 --> 38:27.891
Playing tonight isn't about them.

38:30.043 --> 38:31.371
It's about you.

38:33.976 --> 38:35.181
If you wanna play...

38:36.164 --> 38:37.369
play.

38:48.267 --> 38:49.632
She need that...

38:49.767 --> 38:51.784
to know everything was gonna be okay.

38:52.300 --> 38:54.389
You're due for something good, too.

38:54.672 --> 38:55.926
How do you know?

38:56.454 --> 38:57.757
I can predict the future.

39:03.081 --> 39:04.138
You okay?

39:05.897 --> 39:07.679
Yeah, I'm... I'm hot.

39:10.925 --> 39:12.634
You should get some air.

39:14.209 --> 39:15.242
Yeah.

39:23.572 --> 39:25.698
Hi, everyone. I'm Lori.

40:22.375 --> 40:23.757
You feel better?

40:25.374 --> 40:26.537
I feel great.

40:32.834 --> 40:34.776
- Kiss me.
- What?

40:35.429 --> 40:37.076
Don't make me ask again.

41:18.678 --> 41:20.674
As I listened to Lori play,

41:21.049 --> 41:24.286
I understood that the future
would reach us all in different ways.

41:26.431 --> 41:28.799
Sometimes it would take
your breath away.

41:35.381 --> 41:38.499
Sometimes it would be different
than the version you planned.

42:03.317 --> 42:04.815
Baylin was right.

42:09.053 --> 42:11.124
The only certainty for the future...

42:14.179 --> 42:17.885
is that the answers to the unknown are
most likely hidden right in front of us.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.201
The sound waves gave me the answer.

42:27.173 --> 42:30.085
Baylin's true message
was an alpha-numeric cipher.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.294
Each number corresponded to a letter.

42:33.678 --> 42:36.035
And "Viz Allati" was the key
to unscrambling it.

42:37.249 --> 42:39.181
I wondered why he had gone
to such great lengths

42:39.267 --> 42:40.990
to ensure only I could read it.

42:54.098 --> 42:57.504
Finally, I understood
what he wanted to tell me.

43:10.585 --> 43:12.675
I went to the warehouse
to talk to him...

43:13.029 --> 43:14.252
but Foss...

43:14.515 --> 43:16.401
and all traces of him...

43:16.689 --> 43:18.098
were gone.
