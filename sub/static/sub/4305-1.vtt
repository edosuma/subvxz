00:56.870 --> 00:58.434
Okay, Darnell,

00:58.538 --> 01:01.562
so the candy just happened
to jump into your pocket, huh?

01:01.770 --> 01:03.752
I don't think so.
Samir's gonna call the police now.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.150
- But I...
- Samir, the police.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.738
- Hello, police?
- Please don't call the police. Please.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.240
I'll hold.

01:14.179 --> 01:17.098
That's what happens when you
shoplift, there's consequences.

01:17.307 --> 01:20.122
But it's just some damn candy.
I don't wanna go to jail.

01:20.331 --> 01:23.146
Well, you can probably get away
with stealing sometimes, Darnell,

01:23.355 --> 01:25.649
but, you know, sooner or later
you're gonna get caught.

01:25.857 --> 01:28.360
Is that the way you wanna
lead your life, huh?

01:28.568 --> 01:30.758
- No.
- I happen to believe

01:30.966 --> 01:33.260
that you're worth more.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.659
But you gotta believe it, Darnell.

01:36.076 --> 01:39.308
- I hear you, Miss Evelyn.
- Are you bullshitting me?

01:39.517 --> 01:43.479
- No, ma'am.
- Well, you better not be, you hear me?

01:43.687 --> 01:45.251
Yes, ma'am.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.650
Okay. Now you tell Samir.

01:49.005 --> 01:51.612
I won't steal anymore, sir.

01:55.053 --> 01:56.617
It's all right.

01:57.138 --> 01:59.015
Boy, did you get lucky.

01:59.224 --> 02:01.101
Now I want you to go straight home,
you hear me?

02:01.309 --> 02:02.352
- Yes.
- You shouldn't be out

02:02.560 --> 02:04.750
at this time of the night anyway.
Go on, get.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.731
Thank you, Miss Evelyn.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.656
You handled that just beautifully.

02:14.864 --> 02:19.348
You know, he's a good kid.
He just needs an older brother.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.685
So let's take a look
at these Thanksgiving birds.

02:23.102 --> 02:26.960
Oh, nice. Nice and plump.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.652
Yo, Osama! Osama!
Get behind the register! Now!

02:31.861 --> 02:33.633
- Did you hear what he said?
- Move! Move!

02:33.842 --> 02:36.031
- Please! Take it. Please.
- Shut up, man. Come on.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.595
- I want no trouble.
- Shut the fuck up.

02:37.804 --> 02:38.847
- Take it all.
- Shut up!

02:39.055 --> 02:40.828
- I just came to the country.
- Don't you move.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.643
- Do not move!
- I want no trouble, sir. Take it all.

02:43.852 --> 02:46.354
This is America, homeboy. Black
people don't get what they want

02:46.563 --> 02:48.335
- in this country. Why should you?
- Please!

03:02.725 --> 03:04.289
Move, move, move, move!

03:04.497 --> 03:06.061
Come on. Let's go!

05:28.913 --> 05:31.936
Been a long time since anybody seen
that face around here.

05:32.145 --> 05:34.960
Must've gotten off for good behavior.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.235
Not likely.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.596
That's Bobby Mercer.

05:45.805 --> 05:47.890
Heavyweight champion fuck-up
of the family.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.914
And that's a well-defended title.

05:51.122 --> 05:54.250
Would've made his daddy proud
if he had ever had one.

05:54.459 --> 05:57.066
I used to know him a little.
Played hockey with the boy.

05:57.587 --> 05:59.255
Got thrown out of 60-odd games

05:59.464 --> 06:01.862
before the league
had finally had enough of him.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.573
They called him
the Michigan Mauler.

06:04.782 --> 06:09.370
- Who's the kid?
- Oh, that's Jack. He's the youngest.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.811
First-class fuck-up,
third-class rock star.

06:13.019 --> 06:16.252
- He doesn't look like trouble.
- He's a Mercer.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.441
Don't let him fool you.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.527
Hey.

06:20.735 --> 06:22.299
You all right?

06:22.925 --> 06:24.593
You sure?

06:25.219 --> 06:27.096
You know I love you, man.

06:28.660 --> 06:30.537
Come on, let's go see Jerry.

06:30.745 --> 06:34.395
- What do we got over here?
- Another model citizen, I'm sure.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.480
My mom, she used
to talk about y'all all the time,

06:36.689 --> 06:38.878
about how y'all used
to cut up at work.

06:39.087 --> 06:41.798
- No, actually Jeremiah's all right.
- She told me everything.

06:42.007 --> 06:44.718
You know, he was a rising star
in the union for a while.

06:45.135 --> 06:46.699
Man found a cause.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.054
- How you doing, baby?
- Cool.

06:48.263 --> 06:49.618
Nice house, man. Not bad at all.

06:49.827 --> 06:52.955
What's up, kiddo?
Come on, man. Give me a hug, man.

06:53.164 --> 06:55.562
We got one MIA.
I thought you said there were four.

06:55.770 --> 06:57.334
Angel?

06:58.169 --> 06:59.628
Pretty boy.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.609
Ex-hustler.

07:01.818 --> 07:03.382
Soldier.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.093
Guess he's a no-show today.

07:06.302 --> 07:08.179
Do you remember
when I built that tree house

07:08.387 --> 07:10.160
- and you burned the shit down?
- Come on, man.

07:10.368 --> 07:13.079
- Boy, I wanted to kick your ass, man.
- Don't worry, your house is brick.

07:13.288 --> 07:15.686
- I ain't gonna burn it down.
- Well, now, yeah.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.459
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No smoking in my house,

07:17.667 --> 07:20.483
so you're gonna have
to put that out. Sorry.

07:21.004 --> 07:22.464
I don't get it.

07:22.672 --> 07:24.966
If this woman's such
a goddamn saint,

07:25.175 --> 07:27.990
how did she end up raising
four total fuck-ups?

07:28.199 --> 07:31.327
Ms. Evelyn cycled hundreds
of kids out of the foster-care system

07:31.535 --> 07:33.412
and into permanent homes.

07:33.621 --> 07:37.687
And in 30 years,
she only came across four lost causes.

07:37.896 --> 07:39.251
Four delinquents so far gone,

07:39.460 --> 07:41.650
she couldn't find anyone
to take them in.

07:41.858 --> 07:43.526
So she did.

07:43.735 --> 07:45.090
Trust me, Fowler,

07:45.299 --> 07:49.470
these kids are congressmen compared
to what they would've been.

07:49.887 --> 07:54.162
- Hey there. You must be Daniela.
- Look how big you guys are.

07:54.371 --> 07:56.352
And you must be Amelia.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.959
Nice dress, Amelia.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.982
- I'm Amelia.
- I know.

08:02.191 --> 08:05.006
You guys probably don't remember us,
but I'm your Uncle Bobby

08:05.215 --> 08:06.257
and this is Cracker Jack.

08:06.466 --> 08:07.509
Don't teach them that, man.

08:08.343 --> 08:11.680
- You're not my uncle. You're white.
- Grandma Evey's white.

08:11.888 --> 08:13.661
Yeah, see,
we're a different kind of uncle.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.538
Your grandma,
she adopted me and Uncle Jack,

08:15.746 --> 08:17.206
like she did your daddy.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.500
You're a policeman!

08:19.708 --> 08:22.524
That's right, and you're all under
arrest, so don't nobody move.

08:23.984 --> 08:25.443
Hey, where y'all going?

08:25.652 --> 08:27.842
What about me, Green?
You gonna arrest me too?

08:28.050 --> 08:31.387
All depends, Bobby.
You keeping straight?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.054
Straight-ish.

08:33.264 --> 08:36.392
- How you doing, man?
- Good to see you.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.686
- Jack.
- Green.

08:38.894 --> 08:42.022
Sorry about your mom, brother.
Give me some love.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.942
Jerry.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.279
I thought you said
he wasn't coming.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.198
No, I said I didn't know
if he was coming or not.

08:51.407 --> 08:54.743
I ain't seen him in
Lord knows how many years.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.559
You know it's hard
to track that Bobby down.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.042
Don't give me that look, Camille.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.962
I am way through with that life.

09:05.171 --> 09:07.569
Thanks for coming, Green.
Mom would've been happy you made it.

09:07.777 --> 09:11.427
Shit, your mom would've been happy
you made it back for her funeral.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.138
I didn't come back for no funeral.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.143
Thanks for the offer,
but we got it under control.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.958
Yeah. You know, I could tell by
the looks of things when I drove in.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.878
The place looks completely different.
Detroit's finest cleaned it up, huh?

09:25.086 --> 09:28.110
Yeah, be easy, Bobby.
We got these punks.

09:28.319 --> 09:29.987
Kid playing basketball
across the street

09:30.196 --> 09:32.802
witnessed two gangbangers running in
there, shooting up the place...

09:33.011 --> 09:35.305
Come on, Green. I used to make
a good living around here

09:35.513 --> 09:38.642
because cops like you guys
couldn't find tits in a strip joint.

09:38.850 --> 09:39.788
Why don't you come inside,

09:39.997 --> 09:41.353
have some coffee
and some doughnuts

09:41.561 --> 09:45.315
and then take your boy and get
the fuck out of here, okay? Come on.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.154
Charming guy.

10:07.212 --> 10:09.193
Nice to be home.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.174
So, shit, Bobby,
what've you been up to?

10:11.383 --> 10:14.198
I'm a freaking college professor, Jack.
What do you think I've been doing?

10:14.406 --> 10:16.700
- I doubt that.
- Same old Bobby.

10:16.909 --> 10:20.037
What about you? You still sucking
a little cock left and right, or what?

10:20.246 --> 10:21.810
Fucker.

10:23.374 --> 10:25.668
Y'all ain't right leaving me
out here in the cold like this.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.170
- Yo, little brother! You asshole!
- You ought to be ashamed!

10:28.379 --> 10:29.734
- I missed my plane.
- Get over here.

10:29.943 --> 10:32.133
You missed our mother's
funeral too, jarhead.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.905
- What's up?
- What's up with you?

10:34.426 --> 10:37.346
- What's up, boy?
- It's all good, man.

10:37.555 --> 10:40.891
- You shaved off the Afro, huh?
- Jack!

10:41.621 --> 10:44.019
- Haven't seen you in forever.
- Yeah, I know.

10:44.228 --> 10:48.399
- Did you get your teeth whitened?
- Man, shut up, Jackie-poo.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.480
I'm gonna get me something to eat.

11:09.879 --> 11:12.590
- All y'all hungry?
- No, I'm gonna get some sleep.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.926
Jack, you take your old room, all right?
Angel, take yours.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.220
I'm gonna sleep in Mom's room.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.160
You been crying in here,
you little fairy?

13:07.913 --> 13:10.520
Leave it alone, man.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.857
Still making a lot of racket
on that freaking thing?

13:15.629 --> 13:18.757
Yeah, still making a lot of racket.

13:21.364 --> 13:24.492
- Too weird in Mom's room?
- Oh, man.

13:24.701 --> 13:26.786
Way too weird.

13:26.995 --> 13:28.455
It's crazy.

13:28.663 --> 13:30.123
I mean,
everything's exactly the same.

13:30.332 --> 13:32.834
She didn't change nothing
in this house.

13:39.090 --> 13:41.489
- Look at y'all.
- What?

13:41.697 --> 13:43.261
Nothing. I'm just happy
to see you, man.

13:43.470 --> 13:44.929
Happy to see my brothers,
that's all.

13:45.764 --> 13:47.328
I'm happy to see you too, Jerry.

13:47.536 --> 13:51.186
I guess I'll stop by the grocery store
and grab a turkey or something.

13:51.394 --> 13:53.375
Have a Thanksgiving dinner.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.878
Let's at least act like
we're a real family.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.172
Mom would like that.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.115
Where you think you going?

14:05.262 --> 14:09.433
It's a little heavy in there. I'm gonna
just go outside and get me a little air.

14:10.893 --> 14:14.334
You're full of shit, man. You can smell
that ass from down the street, huh?

14:14.542 --> 14:15.481
What are you talking about?

14:15.794 --> 14:17.566
What do you mean, what?
Come on, what, man.

14:17.775 --> 14:20.069
You know exactly what we're talking
about with La Vida Loca.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.363
Ain't nobody going
to get no La Vida Loca nothing.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.240
- She got a boyfriend.
- She got a boyfriend.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.429
She's got hard dick in her right now.

14:26.638 --> 14:29.245
She's screaming somebody else's
name, and the last thing she's doing

14:29.453 --> 14:31.747
is thinking about your black ass.
Leave it alone, man.

14:31.956 --> 14:34.458
I can't even believe y'all coming at me
with this crazy junk, man.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.335
- She's nothing but trouble.
- I'm standing here

14:36.544 --> 14:37.691
telling y'all both right now,

14:37.899 --> 14:40.506
I'm not going to see that girl,
and I'm not!

14:42.383 --> 14:45.407
- How serious are you with this dude?
- We're serious!

14:48.013 --> 14:49.056
Oh, shit!

14:49.577 --> 14:52.080
Come on, in here.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.981
Loco Ono is not staying
in this house!

14:57.189 --> 14:58.440
- Bullshit, Bobby!
- I don't care!

14:58.649 --> 15:00.839
La Vida Loca ain't staying
in this house one more night.

15:01.047 --> 15:02.611
- So get her stuff...
- So it's your house?

15:02.820 --> 15:05.322
- This ain't no homeless shelter.
- You not running shit, Bobby!

15:05.531 --> 15:06.782
- You not!
- Hey, Bobby.

15:08.972 --> 15:11.683
Baby, why don't you go back upstairs.
I've got this covered.

15:11.891 --> 15:13.455
- What's wrong with you?
- Go back upstairs!

15:13.664 --> 15:15.124
Why do you let him talk
to me like that?

15:15.332 --> 15:16.792
- Go upstairs!
- Was I speaking Spanish?

15:17.001 --> 15:18.773
- Was I speaking Spanish?
- What's your problem?

15:18.982 --> 15:21.172
Can you stop talking
to my girl like that, man?

15:21.380 --> 15:22.840
That's what
I'm talking about, Bobby.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.655
She wasn't your girl as of yesterday,
man. She had another man.

15:25.864 --> 15:27.011
So I'm confused.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.096
What are you talking about, man?

15:29.305 --> 15:30.660
- She is my girl!
- He's right!

15:30.869 --> 15:34.101
Let's just play some fucking
Turkey Cup, man. How about that?

15:38.793 --> 15:40.670
Don't start, man.

15:43.381 --> 15:45.988
- Why do you always do that?
- Shut up.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.950
- To be aggravating.
- "To be aggravating."

15:50.576 --> 15:52.244
Chill out, man.
I'm watching the game. Come on.

15:53.808 --> 15:55.477
- Why don't y'all hold that down?
- Yeah.

15:55.685 --> 15:57.145
Hold that down, man.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.837
- You a woman.
- Get him, Jerry.

16:02.359 --> 16:05.174
- Try it one more time.
- What you gonna do?

16:05.382 --> 16:09.345
- You'll see.
- Big-ass teeth. Bite me?

16:10.179 --> 16:12.681
You do got some
big-ass teeth, Jerry.

16:14.245 --> 16:15.810
Yeah.

16:17.478 --> 16:18.833
All right.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.066
- Yeah, get him, Jerry!
- What's up?

16:22.274 --> 16:23.943
- What the hell you doing?
- Come on, boy.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.696
The Gorgeous Black Ladies
of Wrestling, Nitro and Midnight.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.616
Nitro got Midnight in a headlock.

16:30.825 --> 16:32.284
Get him! Get him, Jerry!

16:32.493 --> 16:35.621
Midnight trying to get up,
but Nitro's on him!

16:35.830 --> 16:38.436
- Get him, Nitro!
- Okay. All right, all right. All right.

16:38.645 --> 16:41.252
I'm still your big brother.

16:43.754 --> 16:46.778
Come on, man, let's eat.
Bring out that bird.

16:50.219 --> 16:53.034
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior,
thank you for this day.

16:53.243 --> 16:54.911
Thank you for this food
we're about to receive

16:55.120 --> 16:57.205
and thank you
for bringing us together. Amen.

16:57.414 --> 16:59.603
- Amen.
- Amen.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.195
Pass me the salad, man.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.809
Zip up your mouth, Jeremiah.

17:39.539 --> 17:41.729
You grow up in a barn?

17:49.132 --> 17:50.279
Close your mouth, Angel.

17:52.469 --> 17:54.346
You think you a cow
or something?

17:58.204 --> 17:59.872
More tattoos, Angel?

18:01.332 --> 18:05.190
You don't have to hide them.
Look at mine.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.176
But take your elbow off the table.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.271
Jackie?

18:31.779 --> 18:35.533
I know bad things happened to you
before you came to me.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.514
Hey, look at me.

18:40.225 --> 18:42.832
But you're safe now.

19:01.809 --> 19:04.103
To hell with this, man.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.169
Let's go get a pickup game.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.359
I wanna see some quick sticks
and some tight passing.

19:10.568 --> 19:11.819
It's too cold, man.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.530
I ain't come all the way back out here
to go play no hockey.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.971
Come on, ladies, let's show
these guys some fucking skills!

19:20.890 --> 19:23.706
Yeah! Come on. Bring it.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.061
All right. Here it comes.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.649
Pass me the puck, Bobby!

19:30.275 --> 19:31.839
Come on, man. Go.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.341
- Y'all watch this.
- You got him.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.721
Yeah! Black present.

19:39.242 --> 19:41.223
- There you go, yes!
- Nigga, please.

19:42.892 --> 19:43.830
Sorry about that.

19:47.792 --> 19:50.191
- Let me to talk to the girls.
- What are you doing? Give me that!

19:50.399 --> 19:52.797
- Get your head out of your ass, Jerry!
- That's my phone, man!

19:53.006 --> 19:55.196
- Come on!
- Hit him hard.

19:55.404 --> 19:58.532
- That was weak.
- Get it, get it, get it.

19:58.741 --> 20:01.869
- Shut up, man.
- There you go!

20:02.077 --> 20:04.684
- Shit, I gotta make a man out of you.
- Damn it, Bobby.

20:04.893 --> 20:07.291
- Why you make them madder?
- Yeah.

20:09.168 --> 20:12.296
Gentlemen, I am truly sorry
about your mother.

20:12.505 --> 20:14.486
Although I only met Evelyn
the one time...

20:16.675 --> 20:18.239
...she made quite an impression.

20:18.448 --> 20:22.306
I know it's difficult to deal
with mundane financial matters

20:22.515 --> 20:25.330
while your heart still grieves
for a loved one.

20:25.538 --> 20:27.624
How much do we get?

20:27.937 --> 20:29.814
Come on, man.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.586
- Excuse me.
- Jack, what the...?

20:31.795 --> 20:33.359
Stupid-ass Jack,
what's wrong with you?

20:33.567 --> 20:35.236
What was that?

20:36.904 --> 20:40.449
This is the contents of your mother's
safety-deposit box.

20:40.658 --> 20:43.369
I'll leave you to look through it.

20:52.128 --> 20:54.213
Birth certificate.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.341
The adoption papers.

20:57.550 --> 21:00.365
Henry Ford Hospital.
So I am from Detroit.

21:01.095 --> 21:04.119
- Lansing, Michigan.
- My mom was 16?

21:04.327 --> 21:06.725
I got any papers in there?

21:07.143 --> 21:08.498
No.

21:08.707 --> 21:10.062
- I don't?
- No.

21:10.479 --> 21:13.712
- You got any papers in there?
- No.

21:16.110 --> 21:17.570
1969.

21:17.674 --> 21:21.011
- Mom went to Woodstock.
- You didn't know Mom was a hippie?

21:21.219 --> 21:22.887
Oh, here we go.

21:29.352 --> 21:33.002
- I ain't got no papers in there, man?
- There's some paper right there.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.026
What about me?

21:36.234 --> 21:39.467
- That'll look good on you.
- Whatever, man.

21:41.135 --> 21:42.595
- You're fucking with me.
- Quit crying.

21:42.699 --> 21:44.159
Come on,
I got something to show y'all.

21:44.367 --> 21:46.661
- This is it.
- So this is your dream, Jerry?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.955
- Oh, yeah.
- There's a lot of space in here.

21:49.164 --> 21:50.936
What are you gonna do,
build some automobiles?

21:51.145 --> 21:53.230
- No, luxury lofts.
- Rims, man.

21:53.439 --> 21:55.316
Urban sophistication
is what I'm talking about.

21:55.524 --> 21:58.235
- So now you're doing real estate?
- This whole first floor here

21:58.444 --> 22:01.468
is gonna be lavish offices
and storefronts.

22:01.676 --> 22:03.240
I'm gonna put
stained-glass windows here...

22:03.449 --> 22:05.534
The building is condemned.
You got insurance?

22:05.743 --> 22:07.203
- Why?
- So we can burn this bitch down.

22:07.411 --> 22:10.331
No, we ain't burning shit down. You
always wanna destroy something.

22:10.539 --> 22:13.042
- Look. Look at your little brother.
- Jack!

22:13.563 --> 22:15.336
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this the master suite?

22:15.544 --> 22:17.630
Am I making the property value
go down?

22:17.838 --> 22:19.715
This shithole gives the term
"Motor City Breakdown"

22:19.924 --> 22:21.592
a whole new meaning, Jerry.

22:21.801 --> 22:23.573
How the hell
you gonna pay for all this?

22:23.782 --> 22:28.370
Government redevelopment loan.
Easy to qualify. Low interest rates.

22:28.578 --> 22:32.540
Y'all stick around,
I might give y'all ass a job.

22:35.981 --> 22:38.171
They look like nipples.

22:40.256 --> 22:42.238
Let's go get a real drink.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.096
Your attention, please.
I wanna make a toast.

22:46.304 --> 22:47.660
To Evelyn Mercer.

22:47.868 --> 22:51.726
The greatest mother
four degenerate bastards ever had.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.670
Johnny, pour me
and my brothers another round.

22:57.878 --> 23:01.736
- And a warm milk for my sister here.
- Man, I will drink you under the table.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.135
We're not talking about sperm,
Jack, this is whiskey.

23:04.343 --> 23:06.533
Jack drinks Jack
Jack drinks Jack

23:06.741 --> 23:08.618
- That's your brother.
- Jack drinks Jack

23:08.827 --> 23:10.599
Jack licks ass crack and ball sack.

23:10.808 --> 23:13.415
Jack doesn't lick ass crack
and ball sack!

23:13.623 --> 23:16.960
Jack likes boobs. Jack gots fans.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.775
Jack's got lots of fans.

23:19.984 --> 23:22.069
- Oh, man.
- Will you shut up, man?

23:22.278 --> 23:24.050
- I don't wanna go.
- Why are you in such a rush?

23:24.259 --> 23:26.240
You can't hang with your big brother
and have a drink?

23:26.448 --> 23:29.577
- I'm here. I mean, what?
- I'm glad y'all here. I love y'all.

23:29.785 --> 23:33.122
Hey, that's real goddamn bad stuff
about your mom, fellas.

23:33.330 --> 23:37.188
- Yeah.
- Freaking gangs. Worms.

23:37.397 --> 23:40.838
- Someone ought to step on them.
- Which gang, Johnny G?

23:41.046 --> 23:43.862
Oh, shit. Here we go. I knew it.

23:44.070 --> 23:45.217
I think I heard something.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.762
The neighborhood's
really upset about this.

23:48.971 --> 23:51.265
Same old Bobby.

23:51.474 --> 23:52.620
Mama always said,

23:52.829 --> 23:56.374
"As bright as Bobby is,
he just does not like to think."

23:56.583 --> 23:57.834
Ain't no good gonna come from this.

23:58.043 --> 24:00.337
- Let the police do their damn job.
- Stop with the police.

24:00.545 --> 24:01.901
Half the cops
in this town are crooked.

24:02.109 --> 24:04.924
You think the other half give two shits
about another liquor-store holdup?

24:05.133 --> 24:07.323
I'm telling you, man,
Green's on our side on this one.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.200
- Come on, man.
- Green?

24:09.408 --> 24:11.911
She's the only woman
that ever gave a damn, man.

24:12.119 --> 24:14.934
The least we can do
is go bang on a few doors

24:15.143 --> 24:17.124
and see what happens.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.584
We owe her that much.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.565
Why are you acting
like such a bitch, Jerry?

24:20.774 --> 24:23.380
Okay. So, what, y'all just gonna
shoot up the whole town

24:23.589 --> 24:24.527
because y'all mad?

24:24.736 --> 24:26.300
- Why not?
- Come on, man!

24:26.509 --> 24:28.385
The people who did this,
they probably from the same

24:28.594 --> 24:30.784
shitty-ass streets we from.

24:30.992 --> 24:33.390
Mom would've been the first
to forgive them. Y'all know that.

24:33.912 --> 24:37.144
- We can't all be saints, Jerry.
- Yeah, we can't all be saints, Jerry.

24:37.353 --> 24:41.732
All right. All right. Cool.

24:42.775 --> 24:45.903
- Bye, Jerry.
- Don't call me when y'all get shot up.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.780
This is Detroit,
in case y'all forgot.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.491
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Johnny.

24:50.699 --> 24:51.951
Come tell us what's going on, man.

24:54.662 --> 24:56.747
You wanna know what I heard?

24:57.790 --> 25:00.292
- You got a burner?
- I flew in.

25:00.501 --> 25:04.567
Man, be careful with my baby.

25:05.610 --> 25:06.861
- You like that?
- Got ammo?

25:07.070 --> 25:10.719
Yeah. It's loaded, little brother.
Careful. Here, you carry the gas can.

25:10.928 --> 25:13.952
- We're gonna do that gas thing?
- Yeah, we're gonna do the gas thing.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.663
The only thing that scares people
more than getting burned to death

25:16.871 --> 25:18.435
is people getting eaten alive.
Let's go.

25:18.644 --> 25:21.147
What do I...? What do I get?

25:21.251 --> 25:25.317
You coming with us? Here you go,
sweetheart. Poke them with that.

25:25.526 --> 25:26.881
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

25:31.782 --> 25:33.972
Let's go. Five-0!
I wanna see some hands!

25:34.180 --> 25:35.536
Five-0, man! Five-0!

25:35.744 --> 25:38.038
It's the fucking police!

25:38.768 --> 25:39.811
Bitch, get off me.

25:40.020 --> 25:41.792
Get out! I don't wanna see
any of you back!

25:42.001 --> 25:43.356
- What are you doing here?
- Hands!

25:43.565 --> 25:44.920
You got any drugs
or alcohol on you?

25:45.129 --> 25:46.797
We're gonna make
y'all take urine samples!

25:47.006 --> 25:49.195
Get out of here!
Get your little asses home now!

25:52.219 --> 25:56.494
The popos is here! Y'all better run,
man, these white cops are crazy!

25:56.703 --> 25:58.580
They killed Cornbread.
He didn't do nothing.

25:58.788 --> 26:00.457
Everybody put
your fucking hands up!

26:00.665 --> 26:02.751
Detroit Police! I wanna see
your fucking hands in the air!

26:02.959 --> 26:05.149
- We got the building surrounded!
- Every last one of you!

26:05.357 --> 26:06.504
Sit your motherfucking ass down!

26:06.713 --> 26:08.381
- Fuck you.
- Sit the fuck down.

26:08.486 --> 26:09.633
- Don't fucking move!
- Sit down!

26:09.841 --> 26:11.926
You. Over here.
Yeah, yeah, you.

26:12.135 --> 26:13.282
You the man, right?

26:13.491 --> 26:16.410
Sit down and shut the fuck up!
Give me the gas.

26:16.619 --> 26:17.870
Yo, what the hell y'all want?

26:18.078 --> 26:19.851
Y'all ain't no cops.
What the hell you doing here?

26:20.060 --> 26:22.875
You're gonna wish I was the police
when I'm done with your ass.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.230
No, no, no, no, no.

26:24.439 --> 26:26.420
This is not the talking part, okay?

26:26.524 --> 26:28.610
This is the listening part,
so shut your mouth.

26:29.027 --> 26:30.904
- Why are you standing up?
- You know who I am?

26:31.112 --> 26:32.364
- It's warm here.
- No?

26:32.572 --> 26:35.387
- Get your ass over there on the couch.
- You don't know why we're here?

26:37.786 --> 26:39.975
- Yo, what the fuck!
- Shut up.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.061
I know you're not gonna tell me
what I wanna know,

26:42.269 --> 26:44.459
so I'm gonna light
your little bitch ass on fire.

26:46.336 --> 26:47.796
Then I'm gonna
watch you run around here

26:48.004 --> 26:50.924
like a chicken with his head cut off,
lighting all your little friends on fire.

26:51.132 --> 26:52.175
Is that what you want?

26:52.384 --> 26:54.886
Which one of your boys shot up
the liquor store on 104th Street?

26:56.242 --> 26:57.701
The police got witnesses, bra.

26:57.910 --> 27:00.621
- Don't even hit us with no bullshit.
- Okay, tough guy. Hey!

27:00.830 --> 27:02.081
Now is the talking part.

27:02.289 --> 27:05.417
You better start saying what
the fuck I wanna hear. Speak.

27:05.626 --> 27:08.233
Man, that shit was counterfeit
as a motherfucker, man.

27:08.441 --> 27:11.569
Ain't nobody playing no basketball
when that shit went down, okay?

27:11.778 --> 27:13.238
Why you think cops
ain't arrest nobody?

27:14.802 --> 27:15.949
What the hell is he doing?

27:16.157 --> 27:18.660
How do you know nobody was playing
basketball if you weren't there?

27:18.868 --> 27:21.892
Because, bitch, police said those
people wasn't killed till 11:00.

27:22.101 --> 27:24.603
- So what?
- So they turn the court lights out at 10!

27:28.461 --> 27:31.589
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Now, where we going, man?

27:31.798 --> 27:32.945
The fuck y'all taking me?

27:33.154 --> 27:35.969
You little bastards need
to stay in school.

27:36.386 --> 27:38.263
That's what you get
for calling my brother a bitch.

27:38.471 --> 27:41.078
I hope you all have
a very nice evening.

27:47.856 --> 27:49.733
It's 10:02, and these
fucking lights are still on.

27:49.941 --> 27:51.818
I know you know
who did this, homeboy.

27:52.027 --> 27:54.216
This is bullshit. Let's pop
this motherfucker right now.

27:54.425 --> 27:55.989
- Speak up on it, man.
- Bobby, take it easy.

27:56.197 --> 27:57.970
- Shut up, Jack. Come on.
- Look, what...?

27:58.179 --> 28:00.577
Yo, man, they gonna shut off!
They gonna shut off, man!

28:00.785 --> 28:02.662
Only lights that are going off
are yours. Let's go.

28:02.871 --> 28:04.435
Look, look, look. Look.

28:08.606 --> 28:10.483
You're fucking lucky.

28:11.421 --> 28:12.985
Told you.

28:13.194 --> 28:16.635
Man, y'all fools been played.
Get off of me, man!

28:16.843 --> 28:18.928
Y'all don't even know
who you messing with, man.

28:19.137 --> 28:21.327
Questioning me about the lights
being off and all that.

28:21.535 --> 28:24.559
Why don't you shut the fuck up, man?
You talk too much.

28:25.602 --> 28:28.938
Jack, it was a questionable kill.

28:29.147 --> 28:30.503
What makes you think that?

28:30.711 --> 28:32.692
Boy, it's sad,
you growing up without a father.

28:32.901 --> 28:34.361
Nobody taught you anything,
did they?

28:34.569 --> 28:37.593
I should've stayed around longer and
held your little hand, huh, sweetheart?

28:37.802 --> 28:38.740
Whatever, man.

28:38.948 --> 28:42.494
Look, sometimes pros will cover up
their shots with another crime.

28:42.702 --> 28:44.162
Like a burglary or something.

28:44.371 --> 28:47.290
Then pay a witness to throw
the cops on to the wrong suspect.

28:47.499 --> 28:49.376
You understand?

28:49.584 --> 28:51.252
Why would anybody wanna kill

28:51.461 --> 28:55.006
the sweetest woman
in the goddamn world?

28:56.257 --> 28:58.864
I don't know, Jackie. I don't know.

29:07.727 --> 29:09.813
All right, I'm here.

29:10.543 --> 29:12.419
- What?
- Last night we found out

29:12.628 --> 29:14.192
it wasn't random.

29:14.401 --> 29:17.320
The witness was paid, and the whole
gang story was some bullshit.

29:17.529 --> 29:18.571
Are you serious, man?

29:18.780 --> 29:21.282
- Come on now.
- Yeah.

29:23.576 --> 29:24.828
Can I help you, gentlemen?

29:25.036 --> 29:28.269
Yeah, if we could just have
a moment of your time, sir.

29:28.477 --> 29:30.980
Evelyn Mercer was our mother.

29:32.127 --> 29:34.629
She was a good lady.

29:35.672 --> 29:37.757
I liked her very much.

29:38.904 --> 29:40.573
Let's come inside.

29:55.483 --> 29:57.673
This doesn't add up.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.389
He's already got the money.

30:37.505 --> 30:39.694
Supposedly, a witness told police
this was a gang shooting.

30:39.903 --> 30:41.154
You know anything about that?

30:41.363 --> 30:43.761
The police talked
for a long time with one man.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.429
One man more than the others.

30:46.263 --> 30:48.244
Would you remember what
he looks like if you see him?

30:48.453 --> 30:51.164
He comes in for Gatorade
after the games.

30:51.373 --> 30:53.979
Big guy. Always wears sweats,
never a jacket.

30:54.188 --> 30:56.378
Even with snow or rain.

30:56.586 --> 30:58.254
He has a dog and a...

30:58.463 --> 31:01.070
- You know a:
- A fro?

31:01.278 --> 31:04.094
Like an Afro? Like Ben Wallace,
the basketball player?

31:04.302 --> 31:06.700
Pistons. Yes, yes, Ben Wallace.

31:07.743 --> 31:08.890
Okay.

31:09.307 --> 31:12.852
- Is he on the courts a lot?
- On the courts or at the gym.

31:16.189 --> 31:18.483
That wasn't no gang shooting,
that was an execution.

31:18.692 --> 31:21.298
They set Mom up.
They set her up.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.592
Come on.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.925
- You guys ready?
- What's the plan, Bobby?

31:44.134 --> 31:46.532
- We're winging it, Jerry.
- We always wing it.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.513
We're gonna get killed.

31:48.722 --> 31:51.224
What you mean "we," white boy?

31:51.433 --> 31:53.101
You ready?

31:55.603 --> 31:57.480
Here we go.

31:57.689 --> 31:58.836
Excuse me.

32:01.234 --> 32:04.049
I'll handle it. I don't know what
the hell you think you're doing,

32:04.258 --> 32:06.031
but you better get
the hell out of here, friend.

32:06.239 --> 32:07.907
I'd love to, friend, but I can't.

32:08.220 --> 32:12.078
Yeah! I got the rock now!
I got this motherfucker now!

32:12.287 --> 32:14.789
- What? What? I got the rock!
- What, bitch?

32:20.629 --> 32:23.131
No need to grab me.
This will only take a second.

32:23.340 --> 32:25.008
Now shut up and listen!

32:25.216 --> 32:26.780
- Get off!
- Get off the floor!

32:26.989 --> 32:28.970
My name is Bobby Mercer.

32:29.179 --> 32:30.847
And some of you probably
knew my mother.

32:31.056 --> 32:32.515
And some of you probably know
she was shot

32:32.724 --> 32:34.288
about a week ago across the street.

32:34.809 --> 32:37.520
Sixty-two years old,
murdered in cold blood!

32:37.729 --> 32:40.649
- Think about it, Bobby, think. Think!
- I'm looking for the witness.

32:40.857 --> 32:42.630
I got this.

32:42.838 --> 32:46.696
Ballplayer. Big guy.
Supposedly never wears a coat.

32:47.218 --> 32:49.720
- Dog lover. Ring any bells?
- Damn.

32:50.346 --> 32:53.578
You tell me where I can find the guy
and you can finish your game.

32:54.934 --> 32:57.436
All we wanna do is talk to the guy.

32:57.645 --> 32:59.834
You can end this real quickly.

33:00.460 --> 33:04.318
Hey! Hey, kid!
No running in the halls!

33:05.882 --> 33:06.925
Get off me, man!

33:07.133 --> 33:09.636
- Why you running?
- Get off me, man.

33:09.844 --> 33:11.826
- Man, I don't know nothing.
- Why don't you shut up?

33:12.034 --> 33:14.745
You got something
to tell me, youngster?

33:14.954 --> 33:18.186
- Back the fuck up!
- I'm looking for who killed my mother.

33:18.603 --> 33:22.357
You tell me where I can find this guy
and you can finish your game.

33:23.295 --> 33:24.547
Cracker Jack.

33:24.755 --> 33:27.988
I appreciate your help very much.
You've all been upstanding citizens.

33:29.656 --> 33:31.637
Enjoy the rest of your game.

33:31.846 --> 33:34.035
You crazy as hell.

33:34.974 --> 33:37.163
- What do we got here?
- Bobby, meet Keenon.

33:38.727 --> 33:40.813
Keenon, this is Bobby.

33:41.438 --> 33:44.671
Something tells me he was
on his way to deliver a warning.

33:44.879 --> 33:46.756
What's his name, Keenon?

33:47.903 --> 33:50.197
Damian. He's my brother.

33:50.614 --> 33:53.847
He's your brother?
No shit. These are my brothers.

33:56.349 --> 33:59.373
- No, dog. He's my real brother.
- Yeah, these are my real brothers.

33:59.477 --> 34:02.605
This is Angel, I'm Bobby.
This is Jack and Jeremiah.

34:02.814 --> 34:04.795
So, what about you and Damian?
You guys still close?

34:05.004 --> 34:07.193
- Does he live at home with you?
- Yeah.

34:07.402 --> 34:08.966
But I ain't telling you shit else.

34:09.175 --> 34:12.824
- Okay.
- I wouldn't sell out my brothers either.

34:15.014 --> 34:16.474
Just calm down, okay?

34:16.995 --> 34:18.766
Look, we just wanna talk to him.

34:18.976 --> 34:22.417
We wanna ask him a few questions.
Is he gonna cooperate?

34:24.190 --> 34:25.545
- We got something.
- Address?

34:25.754 --> 34:27.422
He lives in the Gardens,
right over there.

34:27.630 --> 34:31.592
Enjoy the rest of the game, okay?
Don't worry about it.

34:33.469 --> 34:35.659
These are nice grades.
Better stay in school.

34:36.806 --> 34:38.996
What is that? Aluminum?

34:40.039 --> 34:41.706
Shit doesn't even spin.

34:41.916 --> 34:44.001
Come on, man.

34:44.627 --> 34:46.399
I just don't get it.
Why would somebody hire

34:46.608 --> 34:49.735
a goddamn killer to shoot Mom?

34:49.944 --> 34:50.987
Here's an idea:

34:52.030 --> 34:54.324
We'll wait for the shithead
to get back and we'll ask him.

34:55.158 --> 34:56.931
Well, y'all do what y'all gotta do.

34:57.139 --> 34:59.016
I got gymnastics.
Come on, let me out.

35:01.623 --> 35:03.187
You got your leotard on, Jerry?

35:03.395 --> 35:06.002
Go to hell. Y'all know what I'm talking
about. I got a schedule to keep.

35:06.211 --> 35:08.088
Girls got gymnastics,
I gotta take them.

35:08.296 --> 35:10.799
Come on, let me out, man.

35:11.111 --> 35:13.823
You wanna take Cracker Jack
with you? He's very flexible.

35:14.031 --> 35:16.012
- Bobby, you're the one who took ballet.
- All right, Jerry.

35:16.221 --> 35:17.993
All right, man.

35:19.453 --> 35:24.041
I don't mind
If it rains or freezes

35:24.250 --> 35:28.942
Long as I got
My plastic Jesus

35:29.150 --> 35:31.340
- Riding on the dashboard
- I don't know how you did it

35:31.549 --> 35:33.530
for so many years.
Must have driven you crazy, Angel.

35:33.738 --> 35:36.866
You're on a ship for what, six months
at a time with nothing but dudes?

35:37.075 --> 35:42.288
It wasn't a ship. And the Marines
went coed. They got girls now.

35:42.497 --> 35:44.791
Yeah, I bet you them girls
look like dudes too, though.

35:46.042 --> 35:47.606
Not after six months they don't.

35:50.526 --> 35:54.280
Comes in colors
Pink and pleasant

35:54.488 --> 35:56.991
Glows in the dark...

35:57.199 --> 35:58.555
Oh, that's him. It's him!

36:13.674 --> 36:16.698
Yo, Damian! You Damian?

36:18.366 --> 36:21.390
Why are you pulling out guns
and shit, dog?

36:22.537 --> 36:25.352
- Yo!
- Oh, fuck! Who are these guys, man?

36:26.708 --> 36:29.419
Jack, stay here.
Tell me where it stops.

36:33.694 --> 36:35.154
Come on!

36:35.362 --> 36:37.135
Four.

36:38.595 --> 36:39.533
Five.

36:41.931 --> 36:43.078
Six.

36:43.808 --> 36:45.477
Come on, come on. Shit!

36:48.813 --> 36:51.524
Six. It stopped.

36:51.941 --> 36:54.340
Come on, Angel, we got this clown!
Come on!

36:56.842 --> 36:59.240
Six! He stopped at six!

37:05.392 --> 37:06.539
Yo!

37:07.582 --> 37:09.459
Yo, Damian, I just wanna
ask you a few questions!

37:09.668 --> 37:11.336
I got something for your ass!

37:12.483 --> 37:14.047
Bite his ass, Chucky!

37:14.673 --> 37:15.611
Oh, shit!

37:17.696 --> 37:19.886
Yo, don't shoot my dog, man!

37:20.095 --> 37:21.972
- They got him! That's right!
- Shit!

37:22.180 --> 37:23.536
- Bite his ass!
- Angel! Angel!

37:30.209 --> 37:33.650
Get this fucking dog
off my leg! Shit!

37:34.380 --> 37:36.569
There's a dog trying to eat me, man!
Help me, man.

37:36.778 --> 37:39.906
- Hold on!
- Bite his ass!

37:41.574 --> 37:44.494
- It's biting my legs off!
- Get up off my brother!

37:44.911 --> 37:47.831
Get up off my brother, little boy!
What you doing?

37:51.376 --> 37:52.627
Where you at, playboy?

37:52.836 --> 37:54.296
My eyes.
Give me something for my eyes!

37:54.504 --> 37:57.215
We just wanna talk!
Put that in your eyes.

37:57.424 --> 37:58.675
Talk, huh?

38:00.969 --> 38:03.054
- The window. The window.
- All right.

38:04.723 --> 38:05.765
- Shit!
- Y'all didn't know

38:05.974 --> 38:08.059
- who you was messing with!
- He'll try to come up like...

38:08.268 --> 38:09.519
Get him.

38:11.396 --> 38:12.647
Give me my gun! Give me my gun!

38:12.856 --> 38:14.524
- I ain't playing with this dude!
- Drop it!

38:14.733 --> 38:15.775
I just wanted to talk!

38:19.633 --> 38:21.093
You're going down now!

38:25.055 --> 38:26.724
- Think he dead?
- No, he ain't dead.

38:26.932 --> 38:29.226
He's just fucked up.
Let's go talk to him now.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.876
Man, you must be freezing.

38:33.501 --> 38:36.525
You won't be needing
this no more, playboy.

38:41.635 --> 38:43.407
You know why we're here, Damian?

38:46.118 --> 38:47.682
Come on, man,
call me an ambulance.

38:47.891 --> 38:49.872
An ambulance?
What, for my dog bites?

38:50.080 --> 38:53.521
I'm gonna be okay.
You give me a name, I'll call 911.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.815
I wanna know who shot up
that liquor store now.

38:56.024 --> 38:58.631
- Man, I didn't shoot no one.
- Say what?

38:58.839 --> 39:01.237
Speak up. Can't hear you, playboy.

39:01.446 --> 39:03.531
It's hard to hear you out here
with all this wind.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.972
If we leave, ain't nobody else gonna
hear you out here either.

39:07.181 --> 39:08.745
They say it's gonna be a cold night.

39:08.953 --> 39:11.247
You ain't gonna make it far
with that leg.

39:11.456 --> 39:12.916
Look, man,

39:13.124 --> 39:16.044
these two fools
said they'd pay me a few dubs

39:16.252 --> 39:18.546
if I said I saw some gangsters
shoot up the place, all right?

39:18.755 --> 39:21.675
- But I didn't hurt no one!
- Well, turn into a fucking Fudgesicle.

39:21.883 --> 39:24.698
Hey, come on, man!
I can't say nothing!

39:25.220 --> 39:28.348
Fair enough.
You're gonna die right here.

39:28.869 --> 39:31.372
Yo, man, come on! Yo, man!

39:31.580 --> 39:33.457
- I'm calling his bluff.
- Hey, come on!

39:33.770 --> 39:35.334
- Call an ambulance!
- Think he gonna break?

39:35.543 --> 39:37.211
You see that sparerib
hanging out of his leg?

39:37.419 --> 39:38.879
It's just a matter of time.

39:39.088 --> 39:40.860
- You sure?
- You wanna put money on it?

39:41.069 --> 39:42.529
- Are you sure?
- Someone help me!

39:42.737 --> 39:44.927
- Turn around, dick lips!
- What the fuck you looking at?

39:45.136 --> 39:47.221
- I'll tell you where you can find him!
- Come on!

39:47.429 --> 39:48.994
Just call me an ambulance.

39:49.932 --> 39:52.330
- Give me a name.
- Where can we find him?

39:56.084 --> 39:57.648
Yeah.

40:01.715 --> 40:03.383
How are you guys tonight?

40:11.829 --> 40:14.540
Goatee. Goatee.
Look for the man with the goatee.

40:14.748 --> 40:16.938
- I can get you one bigger than that.
- How big?

40:18.606 --> 40:19.753
- There he is.
- Where?

40:19.962 --> 40:21.318
Right there.
The guy with the goatee.

40:21.526 --> 40:24.654
- I see. Put your fucking hand down.
- Check the cats at the door.

40:26.531 --> 40:28.199
I see him. I see him.
Come on. Let's get him.

40:29.138 --> 40:30.910
- Get down!
- Damn! Go, go, go!

40:31.432 --> 40:34.351
- Run, y'all!
- Move! Everybody move!

40:34.560 --> 40:35.498
- Go, go.
- Clear the way.

40:35.707 --> 40:37.584
- Excuse me.
- Move!

40:37.792 --> 40:40.191
Come on! Come on!

40:40.399 --> 40:41.859
Go ahead, you fucking punks!

40:42.380 --> 40:44.153
Get it, Jackie-o!

40:46.760 --> 40:49.783
You go, girl!
Let's get these motherfuckers.

40:57.708 --> 41:00.106
- Where they at?
- Can't see shit!

41:02.609 --> 41:04.381
- Punch it, Bobby! Punch it!
- I got no traction!

41:04.590 --> 41:07.405
I'm sliding all over the fucking street!

41:15.747 --> 41:17.207
Hold on!

41:18.667 --> 41:20.439
Shit!

41:20.648 --> 41:23.046
Shit! I scraped the whole side
of my fucking car!

41:23.254 --> 41:26.383
- Get these guys before you kill us!
- Sit back and put your seat belt on.

41:30.762 --> 41:33.682
- Watch the snow, man!
- I don't give a fuck about the snow!

41:36.080 --> 41:38.478
Shit! Where the hell's
that shotgun, Jack?

41:38.687 --> 41:40.668
- There's no shells.
- They're in the trunk.

41:40.876 --> 41:42.857
- What the hell am I...?
- Sit down and shut up!

41:43.066 --> 41:45.986
Angel, stick that cannon
out the window and bust some shots!

41:46.194 --> 41:48.801
I'm gonna put one
in the back of their heads!

41:49.948 --> 41:52.138
Shoot those sons of bitches, Angel!
Get them!

41:52.346 --> 41:53.910
Shoot that motherfucker!

41:57.872 --> 41:59.958
- You got him!
- Look out for the snow bank!

42:00.166 --> 42:02.043
Look out!

42:06.631 --> 42:09.134
Jackie, you got your seat belt on?
Watch this. Hold on.

42:13.617 --> 42:15.390
Oh, shit!

42:16.745 --> 42:18.831
- Shit!
- Fuck that nigga. Just drive. Drive!

42:19.039 --> 42:22.272
Don't let them get away!
Don't let them get away!

42:29.988 --> 42:31.552
I got them.

42:32.490 --> 42:34.367
- Shit!
- I'm over this shit!

42:34.576 --> 42:36.765
Pop them, Angel! Pop them!
Get them!

42:39.164 --> 42:41.458
Angel, get your ass in here!

42:44.064 --> 42:46.046
Shit! We got a fucking blowout!

42:46.254 --> 42:48.548
Bobby, let's just stop the car!
Okay, Bobby? Let's stop!

42:48.757 --> 42:52.093
Shut up, Jack! I'm gonna ride
this bitch out on the rim! We got them!

43:08.568 --> 43:09.507
Ready?

43:15.033 --> 43:18.891
Hold on. Hold on.
I got them now. I got them.

43:19.099 --> 43:20.455
- We got them now.
- We got them.

43:20.664 --> 43:22.019
- On your side, man!
- Where they at?

43:22.228 --> 43:23.583
On your side. Look out. Look out!

43:25.564 --> 43:27.024
Hold on!

43:32.550 --> 43:34.010
- Get them! Get them!
- Hold on!

43:52.258 --> 43:54.030
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

43:54.239 --> 43:55.594
That's what
I'm talking about, Bobby.

44:04.353 --> 44:06.334
Jack, you wait here.

44:10.297 --> 44:12.799
- Get your punk ass out the car.
- Fuck you!

44:13.008 --> 44:16.970
- Who sent you?
- I ain't telling you shit!

44:19.472 --> 44:21.453
Get his wallet.

44:22.288 --> 44:24.686
You fucked with the wrong lady.

44:31.359 --> 44:33.236
Let's get the fuck out of here, man.

44:40.327 --> 44:41.578
- Let's go! Come on.
- Are they dead?

44:41.786 --> 44:44.602
- Yeah, they gone!
- They killed Mom. We got them.

44:49.085 --> 44:53.673
- What's happening?
- Lieutenant. It's maximum ugly.

44:54.090 --> 44:57.114
We got two obvious executions.

44:57.531 --> 44:59.095
Any IDs on them?

44:59.304 --> 45:02.432
No. I'll get their prints
before we put them on ice.

45:02.641 --> 45:06.081
What do you say, Green?
Any ideas?

45:06.394 --> 45:08.584
That's what we pay you for.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.637
You're such a pussy, Bobby.

45:19.949 --> 45:22.139
- Give me a break, will you?
- It should be against the law

45:22.348 --> 45:24.850
for people to keep dogs where
someone like you can get to them.

45:25.059 --> 45:26.936
Hey, y'all! Police in the house!

45:27.144 --> 45:28.917
- Get me something to cover my arm.
- Yeah, yeah.

45:29.125 --> 45:30.689
Shit. Hurry up.

45:35.173 --> 45:37.884
Angel. Mind if we come in?

45:38.093 --> 45:39.970
You're already in.

45:40.178 --> 45:41.846
Cops are always welcome
at the Mercers'.

45:42.055 --> 45:44.036
It makes us feel safe and cozy.

45:44.245 --> 45:47.268
Just the way we like it.

45:48.937 --> 45:51.022
Ain't you sexy.

45:51.439 --> 45:53.108
Thank you.

45:53.316 --> 45:56.027
Jackie wanted this little number
for himself, but I fought him for it.

45:58.425 --> 45:59.572
What happened to the hand?

46:00.407 --> 46:02.492
Did you happen to forget
our little conversation we had

46:02.701 --> 46:06.037
at your brother's house about
not interfering with our investigation?

46:06.246 --> 46:10.208
Oh, no, no. This is Turkey Cup, man.
Hockey.

46:10.417 --> 46:12.398
An old Mercer family tradition.

46:12.606 --> 46:14.796
You remember that, don't you, Green?
You played hockey.

46:15.005 --> 46:17.716
Guys can be pretty rough
out on that ice.

46:17.924 --> 46:20.010
Where's you car, Bobby?

46:21.157 --> 46:22.512
It's not outside.

46:22.721 --> 46:26.370
- We left it at Jeremiah's.
- Yeah.

46:26.996 --> 46:28.247
Jerry drove us home.

46:28.455 --> 46:30.645
You know, Volvos are one
of the safest cars out there.

46:31.375 --> 46:34.607
Volvos are incredible, man,
when it's a blizzard outside.

46:34.816 --> 46:36.693
- So we...
- Fascinating.

46:36.901 --> 46:38.674
Hey, Gretzky,
you know what this is?

46:38.883 --> 46:42.324
- A hair from your wife's tit?
- Try from your thick skull.

46:42.532 --> 46:46.182
Forensics took it off a pair of contract
killers we found dead this morning.

46:46.390 --> 46:49.205
Fishing for a confession
with a phony hair, huh?

46:49.414 --> 46:53.272
That's an old one, boys.
Come on, Green.

46:54.419 --> 46:58.068
You know when I'll know you got
my hair off a dead body, right?

46:58.277 --> 47:01.092
When I hear the jailhouse doors
close behind me, girls.

47:01.301 --> 47:02.969
Okay, then you tell me
what they told you.

47:03.491 --> 47:06.931
You think that these thugs
were hired to kill Evelyn, is that it?

47:07.349 --> 47:09.121
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Green.

47:09.330 --> 47:14.230
Wait, Green, how do you go from
petty thug to contract killer?

47:14.648 --> 47:17.254
And if they were
professional shooters, like you say,

47:17.671 --> 47:20.904
they'd have never told us who they
was working with anyway.

47:21.112 --> 47:23.615
Even if they got one hell
of an ass-whupping.

47:24.866 --> 47:27.786
You think you're pretty cute,
don't you? He does.

47:28.098 --> 47:30.184
Everybody's a smart guy
until I bust them in the mouth.

47:30.392 --> 47:31.748
- Wait!
- You gonna bust me in my mouth?

47:31.956 --> 47:34.250
- This ain't what I'm here for!
- The fuck you think this is?

47:34.459 --> 47:36.127
Hey, stop!

47:37.796 --> 47:41.132
Look, Bobby, if you got something,
you give it to me.

47:41.341 --> 47:43.218
And if it's something vital,
we will run with this.

47:43.426 --> 47:46.659
But don't try and take on Detroit
by your damn self.

47:46.867 --> 47:48.744
You keep knocking
on the devil's door long enough,

47:48.953 --> 47:51.247
and sooner or later,
somebody gonna answer you.

47:54.896 --> 47:56.982
What's up, guys?

47:57.816 --> 48:01.569
Oh, shit. Evan, Vic's here.
Vic's here.

48:01.778 --> 48:04.280
- Ladies, get up.
- Get up. Come on, go, go!

48:04.489 --> 48:05.845
I'm going.

48:12.414 --> 48:14.812
Out-of-town shooters.

48:15.959 --> 48:17.106
That's what I said.

48:17.314 --> 48:19.504
I remember hearing myself saying,

48:19.713 --> 48:22.736
"Out-of-town shooters."

48:22.945 --> 48:26.699
You know what?
You don't pay a ho to fuck you.

48:27.220 --> 48:29.514
You pay her to leave.

48:30.348 --> 48:32.017
What you pay
out-of-town shooters to do?

48:32.851 --> 48:35.562
You pay them to get
the hell back out of town.

48:35.770 --> 48:39.107
That's why I asked
for out-of-town shooters.

48:39.420 --> 48:40.984
What'd I get?

48:41.401 --> 48:43.695
In-town shooters.

48:44.738 --> 48:49.743
Someone decided
to hire in-town shooters.

48:50.785 --> 48:52.558
You know what else
I got for my money?

48:52.766 --> 48:54.852
In-town police.

48:56.207 --> 48:58.501
In-town trouble.

49:00.065 --> 49:03.089
Who's got to get
in the ring with me on this?

49:04.028 --> 49:05.383
You hungry, Evan?

49:07.886 --> 49:10.284
You must be hungry, right?

49:12.474 --> 49:14.038
- I'm sorry...
- Don't apologize!

49:15.393 --> 49:17.687
Dog's gotta eat, right?

49:18.313 --> 49:20.920
I tell you what, you wanna come
in my restaurant and eat? Go ahead!

49:21.128 --> 49:22.171
Eat, dog, eat!

49:26.133 --> 49:28.010
Get the fuck out of my seat, man!

49:36.456 --> 49:38.124
Eat!

49:43.234 --> 49:45.215
That's a good boy.

49:45.945 --> 49:47.404
- That's a good boy.
- That's bullshit.

49:47.613 --> 49:50.741
Shut your mouth, bitch!
I'll put you down there with him.

49:51.888 --> 49:55.850
Matter of fact, get your ass over here
and share a meal with your man!

49:56.476 --> 49:58.040
Now.

50:15.558 --> 50:17.226
Lap that shit up good.

50:22.961 --> 50:26.089
Now find out who killed
the shooters.

50:27.132 --> 50:30.260
- What bastard hired these guys?
- West Marine's by the river, right?

50:30.364 --> 50:33.492
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go take a look.

50:33.701 --> 50:35.161
All right.

50:38.289 --> 50:41.313
- Baby.
- Now, sweetie,

50:41.521 --> 50:44.649
wasn't there a discussion
about a dinner together?

50:44.858 --> 50:47.360
Because I seem to remember
spending two hours in the kitchen.

50:47.569 --> 50:49.446
We got some important shit
to deal with, baby.

50:49.654 --> 50:51.635
She's so la vida loca.

50:51.844 --> 50:53.825
- Man, don't do that right now.
- Shut up, Bobby.

50:54.034 --> 50:56.223
- Don't you start with that crap!
- Can y'all not go there?

50:56.432 --> 50:59.247
- That's why you don't get a girlfriend.
- Don't go there, please.

50:59.456 --> 51:01.958
You know what?
I want a girlfriend like you.

51:03.105 --> 51:05.608
- Can we go?
- Angel.

51:05.816 --> 51:09.049
You said this time
was gonna be different.

51:12.385 --> 51:14.262
You're breaking mi corazón.

51:16.765 --> 51:18.433
She's getting
real comfortable here, huh?

51:18.642 --> 51:19.851
What are you doing?

51:20.060 --> 51:22.896
I thought you was a macho man.
A tough guy.

51:25.982 --> 51:29.152
You know, it's a real shame that little
Jackie's the only one down to ride.

51:29.361 --> 51:31.446
Let's go, Jackie.

51:31.655 --> 51:33.615
Say goodbye
to your big sister, Jackie. Let's go.

51:33.782 --> 51:37.243
You gonna leave me too?
I just need 15 minutes, man.

51:37.452 --> 51:41.956
She's addicted
to what Angel's dick did.

51:46.378 --> 51:48.004
Sofi?

51:49.047 --> 51:50.590
Baby.

51:52.300 --> 51:54.344
Just like when we were 16.

51:56.346 --> 51:58.306
My favorite room in the house.

51:58.556 --> 52:01.142
I already set it to spin.

52:11.486 --> 52:14.114
- Who are you?
- Hi, I'm with State Farm.

52:14.322 --> 52:16.992
I have a question or two about
your mother's insurance policy.

52:21.705 --> 52:24.124
It's imperative that I speak
with Jeremiah immediately.

52:24.332 --> 52:25.375
The check is being processed,

52:25.583 --> 52:27.711
but nonetheless,
some red flags have been raised.

52:27.919 --> 52:29.129
What do you mean, red flags?

52:29.337 --> 52:32.716
Well, it's an unusually high payout
for a simple life-insurance policy.

52:32.924 --> 52:35.719
For the last two years,
the premium was paid via check

52:35.927 --> 52:37.429
from your brother's bank account.

52:37.679 --> 52:41.558
With your brother's criminal record and
his business near bankruptcy, well,

52:41.766 --> 52:43.893
- it's our responsibility to investigate.
- Bankruptcy?

52:44.102 --> 52:46.813
Wait, so Jeremiah's broke?

52:47.981 --> 52:50.817
- Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Certainly.

52:51.026 --> 52:53.028
- Angel, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, baby.

52:53.236 --> 52:55.864
What the hell is this?

52:56.072 --> 52:57.949
Oh, those are breath mints, baby.
Give me one sec...

52:58.158 --> 53:00.118
- You know I'm allergic to latex.
- I should be going.

53:00.327 --> 53:02.329
- No, no. Hold on, please.
- Who did you buy them for?

53:02.537 --> 53:03.997
Put the cuckoo back
in the clock, baby.

53:04.164 --> 53:06.291
I bought them in Vegas before
I knew I was coming here.

53:06.499 --> 53:08.084
- Who are they for?
- For no one!

53:08.293 --> 53:10.003
Please, sir, please.

53:10.211 --> 53:11.588
Baby, if we gonna talk about this,

53:11.796 --> 53:14.674
- can we please do it outside?
- Okay, you wanna talk outside?

53:14.883 --> 53:16.301
Well then fine, let's talk outside!

53:16.509 --> 53:18.428
We're gonna talk right now.
We're gonna talk right...

53:18.637 --> 53:21.014
Get your ass out of here, girl.

53:24.059 --> 53:25.644
So how much is my brother getting?

53:25.852 --> 53:29.314
- A little more than 400,000.
- Open the door now.

53:29.564 --> 53:30.565
That's crazy.

53:30.899 --> 53:33.276
Check everything, Jackie. There's
gotta be some shit around here

53:33.485 --> 53:35.528
that ties these guys
to somebody else.

53:58.385 --> 54:01.846
You dicking around in here?
You find anything?

54:02.931 --> 54:04.641
A camera.

54:04.849 --> 54:06.059
Come on.

54:06.977 --> 54:08.395
Thank you.

54:08.770 --> 54:11.147
- Big Chief.
- Hey, thanks.

54:11.564 --> 54:14.651
Angel Mercer. How you doing?

54:14.859 --> 54:17.404
I ain't worked for Jerry
for a long time.

54:17.654 --> 54:20.240
Not since he started up
those luxury condos.

54:20.490 --> 54:23.785
High-dollar stuff like that brings in
all the gangsters.

54:23.994 --> 54:26.705
Wait. So you're saying Jerry
got mixed in with some gangsters?

54:27.122 --> 54:29.165
What's going on?

54:29.374 --> 54:33.336
There's this do-gooder. He's on
city council. His name's Douglas.

54:33.545 --> 54:35.171
- Okay.
- He's the guy who shut down

54:35.380 --> 54:37.215
Jerry's warehouse project.

54:37.632 --> 54:39.676
He'll know who Jerry
got mixed up with.

54:43.722 --> 54:46.099
SIG Sauer.45 auto.

54:46.308 --> 54:48.852
That'll blow your back out.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.274
Nine millimeter Beretta.

54:54.482 --> 54:55.984
Oh, look at this Beretta.

54:56.192 --> 54:58.945
It's triple-action.
Three bullets at once.

54:59.154 --> 55:00.280
They say dead men tell no tales,

55:00.488 --> 55:02.282
but they sure leave
important shit lying around.

55:02.449 --> 55:04.284
Hey, what the hell
are y'all doing now?

55:05.160 --> 55:07.287
Just getting a head start
on next year's taxes, Jerry.

55:07.454 --> 55:10.457
Look how y'all doing
Mama's house!

55:10.665 --> 55:13.126
Come on. Look at this table, man.
Come on.

55:13.293 --> 55:15.420
- You know what? You're right.
- Hey, Sofi, why don't you

55:15.670 --> 55:17.297
do me a favor
and clean up some of this shit?

55:17.464 --> 55:19.299
Make yourself useful.

55:20.884 --> 55:22.886
You missed.

55:24.763 --> 55:26.389
Hey, Bobby.

55:28.767 --> 55:31.978
- Where'd y'all get this?
- Our friend Stanly, the shooter.

55:32.187 --> 55:34.064
Let me see that.

55:34.564 --> 55:36.816
- They were tracking Mom.
- That's that guy.

55:37.233 --> 55:39.486
That's that lawyer guy.
That shithead said...

55:39.694 --> 55:41.821
He said he only met
her once, Bobby.

55:42.030 --> 55:44.366
Where the hell you been?
I been trying to call you all day.

55:44.574 --> 55:45.867
Following up new leads.

55:47.619 --> 55:49.371
Yep. Let's go.

55:49.579 --> 55:52.499
Jerry, you coming with us? Don't
you wanna find out who hired them?

55:52.707 --> 55:54.626
Yeah, don't you wanna
find out who killed Mom?

55:54.834 --> 55:57.629
- Of course I do, man.
- Let's go. Stop bullshitting. Come on.

55:57.837 --> 55:59.172
All right.

55:59.381 --> 56:01.174
Somebody gotta look after
y'all clowns.

56:02.425 --> 56:06.763
- Oh, so now you calling us clowns?
- Well, I call it like I see it.

56:08.014 --> 56:09.391
- What?
- You're gonna leave again?

56:09.599 --> 56:11.017
- That's your problem.
- Okay, fine.

56:11.226 --> 56:13.353
- Go. Go.
- You gonna be here. Whatever.

56:13.561 --> 56:16.731
We might have to spend
the night up in this bitch.

56:18.525 --> 56:21.403
An attack dog.
Come here, poochie.

56:21.611 --> 56:24.114
You don't wanna bite me, do you?

56:24.614 --> 56:26.199
You gonna bite me, baby?

56:26.533 --> 56:29.202
Hey, Bobby, check this out.
I found Bradford's calendar.

56:29.411 --> 56:34.416
You don't think "EM" stands
for Evelyn Mercer, do you?

56:34.624 --> 56:38.920
- You're getting good at this, Jackie.
- November 21.

56:39.129 --> 56:41.589
He met up with her
the night she died.

56:41.798 --> 56:44.217
Why would anybody meet up
with their lawyer at 8:00 at night?

56:44.384 --> 56:46.177
Angel!

56:47.429 --> 56:49.306
- Nice. Your girlfriend's here.
- She's crazy, man.

56:49.514 --> 56:50.724
Well, go shut her up then.

56:50.932 --> 56:54.811
Angel! Angel, come out!
I see you in the window!

56:55.020 --> 56:57.105
Come out, you idiot!
I know you're in there!

56:57.314 --> 56:59.441
Y'all come out here with me.
This girl is crazy.

56:59.649 --> 57:03.653
Angel! People, there's robbers
in the house!

57:04.112 --> 57:05.113
Come out, Angel!

57:05.322 --> 57:07.324
- I'm gonna call the police now!
- Come on!

57:07.532 --> 57:09.034
You better call
immigration on this girl.

57:09.242 --> 57:12.037
You've got a real class act here.

57:13.788 --> 57:15.582
- She should be at Guantanamo Bay.
- Oh, my God.

57:15.790 --> 57:17.083
Locked up.

57:18.960 --> 57:20.962
Excuse me. What are you doing?

57:21.171 --> 57:23.298
- How you doing, buddy?
- Bobby! Bobby! He's a lawyer!

57:23.506 --> 57:25.175
- What's going on here?
- He's a liar, Jerry!

57:25.383 --> 57:27.177
- Ain't nobody's business! Stay away!
- Come here!

57:27.385 --> 57:28.887
You heard me, old man.

57:29.137 --> 57:31.848
You fucking lied to me. You said
you didn't even know my mother.

57:32.057 --> 57:34.976
You were the last person
to see her alive.

57:35.935 --> 57:38.188
Look at that, Jerry. It leaves
a nice big red handprint, huh?

57:38.563 --> 57:39.689
Just ask him the question.

57:39.898 --> 57:44.277
No, I'm gonna do it again and again
until I find out what I wanna know.

57:44.444 --> 57:45.570
- Oh, God!
- Tell him!

57:45.820 --> 57:48.698
Okay. Okay, I'll explain.

57:48.907 --> 57:50.450
It's just that I...

57:50.659 --> 57:53.453
- I felt so guilty.
- Guilty for what?

57:53.620 --> 57:56.706
I'm not even sure
I know how to say it.

57:56.915 --> 57:59.334
- Say what?
- Your mother and I were...

58:00.001 --> 58:01.795
Were seeing each other socially.

58:02.003 --> 58:04.923
- Socially?
- I didn't want to sully

58:05.131 --> 58:06.341
your mother's reputation.

58:06.549 --> 58:08.927
- She was a fine, fine woman.
- I know. I know.

58:09.177 --> 58:10.720
I have some of your mother's
night things,

58:10.929 --> 58:12.305
- if you want. They...
- What?

58:12.472 --> 58:14.975
- No. No, it's not necessary.
- Too much information.

58:15.183 --> 58:17.394
Baby, listen, I need you
to get out of here.

58:17.602 --> 58:20.563
I apologize, Mr. Bradford.
We broke your back window.

58:20.772 --> 58:22.524
We're just trying to figure
out what happened.

58:22.732 --> 58:25.026
- I understand.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

58:25.235 --> 58:27.195
- You have a beautiful home here.
- Thank you.

58:31.241 --> 58:34.077
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yo.

58:39.207 --> 58:42.711
- Hey, man. I gotta ask you a question.
- What's up?

58:42.919 --> 58:45.839
You know me and Sofi
did a lot of making up last night.

58:46.047 --> 58:48.967
- You gave her that ring, huh?
- Yeah.

58:49.175 --> 58:53.346
But it seem like I got
a little rust on the tools down here.

58:53.555 --> 58:55.598
Ask the cockologist
in the shower, man.

58:55.807 --> 58:57.809
- How the hell would I know?
- You're the expert.

59:01.271 --> 59:04.441
- Rug burn.
- You're gonna live.

59:04.649 --> 59:06.860
Thank God, man.
I thought my luck ran out.

59:11.406 --> 59:12.866
Hey, listen, man.

59:13.074 --> 59:14.784
You know, Jerry
ain't been straight up with us

59:14.993 --> 59:17.078
about that redevelopment project.

59:17.287 --> 59:21.207
Found out his dream's dead. Jerry
got involved with some bad people.

59:21.416 --> 59:23.752
City got on him about fraud
and whatnot.

59:24.169 --> 59:26.129
Cut his loans off like a month ago.

59:26.338 --> 59:29.466
- Technically, Jerry's really broke.
- You think this had something to do

59:29.674 --> 59:30.800
with what happened to Mom?

59:31.009 --> 59:33.386
No, I'm saying that it's something
that we should look into.

59:33.887 --> 59:37.891
I need y'all to go down and visit
this city official named Douglas.

59:38.099 --> 59:39.893
He'll know who Jerry
got mixed up with.

59:40.435 --> 59:41.895
I'm gonna go check
on some other shit.

59:42.103 --> 59:43.104
What are you talking about?

59:43.313 --> 59:45.273
Why don't you just tell me
what you know, Angel?

59:45.482 --> 59:48.318
I know you need to stay your ass
on that porcelain.

59:48.526 --> 59:51.029
This is gonna require a little finesse.

59:51.237 --> 59:53.114
And given your prior reputation
as a hothead,

59:53.323 --> 59:56.117
- I wrote the fucking book on finesse.
- You gonna be the first to fuck up.

59:56.326 --> 59:59.329
Wait for me to wipe my ass, Angel.
I'm coming with you.

59:59.537 --> 01:00:01.081
Angel!

01:00:01.956 --> 01:00:04.000
Get me some
fucking toilet paper, Jack.

01:00:04.459 --> 01:00:05.418
Angel!

01:00:06.044 --> 01:00:09.339
You know, you didn't come up
on the list of any of Evelyn's friends

01:00:09.547 --> 01:00:12.968
- or known associates, Mr. Bradford.
- No?

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:16.471
I got your name
off of her phone records.

01:00:17.889 --> 01:00:19.432
Well...

01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:23.228
Well, yes. Yes, we did try to keep
our relationship

01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:26.606
- somewhat discreet.
- There we go. There we go.

01:00:26.773 --> 01:00:29.275
You know, well,
maybe you can help me then.

01:00:29.484 --> 01:00:34.447
You see, what I've gathered so far,
it seems that...

01:00:34.656 --> 01:00:38.410
...Evelyn had become upset with
her son Jeremiah's business situation.

01:00:38.618 --> 01:00:41.079
Yes, she was starting
to raise a bit of a stink.

01:00:41.287 --> 01:00:45.917
But... But wasn't all that covered
in the police report that she filed?

01:00:47.294 --> 01:00:49.254
What police report?

01:00:51.798 --> 01:00:53.633
Councilman Douglas.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.010
Sorry to startle you.

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.595
My name's Bobby Mercer. I believe
you know my brother, Jeremiah?

01:00:57.804 --> 01:01:00.640
Apparently, you were the one
who got his business shut down, right?

01:01:00.807 --> 01:01:02.642
This is not the proper venue
for an appeal.

01:01:02.851 --> 01:01:04.894
Look, we're not really concerned
with that, councilman.

01:01:05.103 --> 01:01:06.980
I heard my brother got mixed
up with some hoodlums.

01:01:07.147 --> 01:01:09.274
You know what I'm talking about?

01:01:09.482 --> 01:01:12.902
I can't help you. Excuse me.

01:01:33.465 --> 01:01:35.258
Gas?

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:38.345
Councilman!

01:01:39.721 --> 01:01:43.058
Now I gotta light your ass on fire!
All I wanted was a name!

01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:47.604
You're gonna make me turn your ass
into the black gingerbread man now!

01:01:47.812 --> 01:01:48.980
It's all right.

01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:51.232
I'll have my little brother
here suck your burning dick.

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:54.653
Give me the fucking cigarette.
Roll down the window.

01:01:56.196 --> 01:01:58.782
Victor. Victor Sweet.

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.575
What about him?

01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:06.623
Is there a problem?

01:02:18.009 --> 01:02:20.553
Goddamn, Jerry.

01:02:23.056 --> 01:02:25.225
There she is.

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:27.435
So she got in there at 6:05.

01:02:27.894 --> 01:02:30.021
Fast-forward that.

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:33.566
Hey, look. That's Fowler.

01:02:34.234 --> 01:02:38.697
Wait, pause it, pause it. He didn't say
anything to me about talking to her.

01:02:39.406 --> 01:02:42.575
Fast-forward to when she leaves.

01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:44.953
Okay, stop.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.457
So she was here until 7:11.

01:02:57.132 --> 01:02:59.759
He spent more than an hour
with her.

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.346
- What do you think he found?
- I don't know, but it's something big.

01:03:03.555 --> 01:03:05.557
- How can you tell?
- By the sound of his voice.

01:03:05.765 --> 01:03:07.392
I know my brother.

01:03:10.478 --> 01:03:12.731
What's going on, Angel?

01:03:13.106 --> 01:03:17.736
- Was that councilman helpful?
- Oh, yeah. A real public servant.

01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:21.990
You remember a punk
named Victor Sweet?

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:25.785
- I remember a Malcolm Sweet.
- Victor was his nephew.

01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:29.205
Used to deliver things for his uncle.
Like firebombs and beatings.

01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:33.084
You remember. Malcolm used
to love to humiliate him all the time.

01:03:33.293 --> 01:03:34.794
Yeah, I remember that dude.

01:03:35.003 --> 01:03:36.796
Apparently, Victor got sick
of the ass-whuppings

01:03:36.963 --> 01:03:38.590
and sunk his uncle into the river.

01:03:38.798 --> 01:03:40.634
He owns
the whole neighborhood now.

01:03:40.842 --> 01:03:42.677
No shit?

01:03:43.595 --> 01:03:45.472
Hey, Bobby.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.977
Word around town is that Jerry
owed a lot of people some money.

01:03:51.186 --> 01:03:53.188
What are you talking about?

01:03:55.106 --> 01:03:58.193
Recognize that dude over
there with the fat head?

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:02.155
Yeah, that's Evander Pearson.
He used to be all right, that guy.

01:04:02.364 --> 01:04:04.157
Jerry and him used to hang
during the union days.

01:04:04.366 --> 01:04:07.535
He goes by Evan now. And he's
working for a guy named Victor.

01:04:09.788 --> 01:04:11.706
You guys are coming
up with this pretty quick.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:14.167
Yeah, we should have been cops.

01:04:17.295 --> 01:04:19.047
What are we doing here, Angel?

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.174
Holy shit.

01:04:33.019 --> 01:04:35.021
- Evan.
- Jerry.

01:04:35.188 --> 01:04:37.190
I hate meeting you here, man,
with your kids and all,

01:04:37.399 --> 01:04:38.608
but you know how it goes.

01:04:38.817 --> 01:04:40.944
- I understand.
- I got it.

01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:46.658
I found out Jerry got a big
insurance check for Mom's death.

01:04:47.325 --> 01:04:48.952
Be cool, brother.

01:04:50.412 --> 01:04:53.331
Forget Jerry. We're gonna
find him later. Come on.

01:05:00.755 --> 01:05:03.842
- Yo, Evander! What's up?
- Muriel! We leaving.

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:06.428
- Game's over. Let's go.
- Put your jacket on. It's time to go.

01:05:08.763 --> 01:05:10.890
It's nice to see you, boys,
but we was just leaving.

01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:13.601
You ain't going nowhere.
What was you talking to Jerry about?

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.228
Nothing. Just saying hello.

01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:18.231
Me and Jerry go way back from
the union days. You know that, Bobby.

01:05:18.732 --> 01:05:20.692
Angel tells me you're
one of Victor Sweet's boys now.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.570
Hear he's running shit like his uncle.
Treating you like a house nigger.

01:05:23.778 --> 01:05:26.448
What are you thinking about, Evan?
The dude's a punk.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:30.744
You been gone a long time, fellas.
Times change.

01:05:31.244 --> 01:05:33.413
- What's in that envelope?
- What envelope?

01:05:33.621 --> 01:05:35.582
You wanna play that fucking game
with me right now?

01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:40.420
- Y'all gonna do this here?
- Right here. Right now.

01:05:40.629 --> 01:05:44.257
Give me the envelope
and take a walk. Now!

01:05:48.762 --> 01:05:50.430
Go ahead, Evander.
Take the kids home.

01:05:50.639 --> 01:05:52.682
We'll see your ass again real soon.

01:05:52.891 --> 01:05:54.684
Let's go.

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:56.227
Hurry up.

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:00.607
Councilman.

01:06:00.815 --> 01:06:02.859
Pull up a chair.

01:06:09.282 --> 01:06:11.951
Vic, this cop came
to see me today,

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.788
and he was asking
about that woman.

01:06:16.081 --> 01:06:18.249
Don't worry about cops.

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:20.627
- I got cops.
- No, I'm not.

01:06:20.794 --> 01:06:23.546
But I'm worried about this guy
Bobby Mercer.

01:06:23.755 --> 01:06:25.465
He came to see me
after the cop did.

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:28.009
You tell him my name?

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:30.762
Of course not, Vic. I mean...

01:06:30.971 --> 01:06:33.974
But look, you know, we can't
do business like this anymore.

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:35.725
Nothing's changing.

01:06:35.934 --> 01:06:38.520
Evan and I were just talking
about this fella, Bobby Mercer.

01:06:44.192 --> 01:06:50.615
- Vic, I did not tell the man anything.
- Did you tell him my name?

01:06:50.824 --> 01:06:53.952
- No, I swear...
- Yes, you did! You stinking coward.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.329
I smelled it on you
the second you walked in here.

01:06:56.538 --> 01:06:59.040
Now go sit at the other table.

01:07:02.877 --> 01:07:05.630
- Excuse me?
- Go sit at the kiddie table!

01:07:05.839 --> 01:07:10.093
I ain't finished with you. I ain't finished
my hand, so sit your ass down!

01:07:11.678 --> 01:07:15.515
- Are you in trouble?
- He's on a time-out.

01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:18.435
Come on, man, what you got?

01:07:21.813 --> 01:07:24.691
No. I'm out.

01:07:26.359 --> 01:07:29.154
Nines. Won again.

01:07:29.362 --> 01:07:30.363
Oh, Charlie.

01:07:30.572 --> 01:07:33.950
I heard you're marrying
that fine piece of ass of yours.

01:07:34.826 --> 01:07:37.245
Yeah, that's right, that's right.
This spring, in fact.

01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:39.581
How about I send you
on a little out-of-town work, huh?

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.708
Give me a little
one-on-one time alone

01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:44.794
with that cute little Italian thing
of yours, huh?

01:07:45.337 --> 01:07:46.796
How would that be?

01:07:47.005 --> 01:07:49.215
I'll teach her some nice tricks
for you.

01:07:49.424 --> 01:07:51.509
Yeah, maybe you can teach her
how to cook.

01:07:51.718 --> 01:07:54.095
No, man, I'll teach her better things
than that.

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:56.306
She's too much woman
for you, Charlie.

01:07:56.514 --> 01:07:59.225
You're gonna have
to share her around a bit.

01:08:02.437 --> 01:08:06.024
- Nine! My turn!
- You're the one that...

01:08:06.399 --> 01:08:07.525
All right, you kids.

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:12.030
- Who wants some ice cream, huh?
- Me!

01:08:12.238 --> 01:08:16.701
Why don't you run upstairs. We'll get
you some ice cream. Go on now.

01:08:30.799 --> 01:08:32.466
Evan.

01:08:33.093 --> 01:08:34.719
Pistol.

01:08:36.638 --> 01:08:38.014
I ain't playing no more.

01:08:38.223 --> 01:08:41.100
I'm gonna go in there and bust that
melon and find out what he's thinking.

01:08:41.475 --> 01:08:42.852
His family's in there.

01:08:43.395 --> 01:08:45.647
- You're gonna have to calm down.
- I don't give a shit, man.

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:47.482
Oh, I'm calm.

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:49.567
- I'm calm.
- Let me just call him.

01:08:49.776 --> 01:08:51.236
He thinks I'm an idiot.

01:08:51.444 --> 01:08:54.488
He thinks I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:56.533
- Jerry.
- Yeah?

01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:58.493
- It's Angel.
- What's up, man?

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:02.122
Look, man. We need to meet up first
thing tomorrow at Mom's house.

01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:03.832
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Calm down, Bobby.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.084
We still family, right?

01:09:07.294 --> 01:09:09.379
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah, man.

01:09:10.005 --> 01:09:11.298
Okay.

01:09:11.464 --> 01:09:14.091
- Is he coming?
- Yeah.

01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:15.301
Good.

01:09:43.997 --> 01:09:46.499
- What?
- You know what you did.

01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:49.294
No! You don't know
who you fucking with!

01:09:49.502 --> 01:09:51.171
Where's Bobby?

01:09:52.339 --> 01:09:54.966
- What are you hiding, Jerry? What?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:09:55.175 --> 01:09:57.052
If you had something to do
with what happened,

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.596
I swear to God, Jerry,
I'm gonna kill you right here and now!

01:09:59.804 --> 01:10:01.681
- No, Bobby, no!
- Angel's gonna ask some questions.

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:04.351
And, brother, I shit you not,
the time for lying is over.

01:10:04.517 --> 01:10:06.061
We know you're lying
about your business.

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:08.146
And we know you got mixed up
with some gangsters.

01:10:08.355 --> 01:10:10.065
- Hold on...
- Stay down!

01:10:12.233 --> 01:10:14.402
Y'all think I had something to do
with Mom getting killed?

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:17.947
You got a check for 400,000 that you
just so happened to forget to mention

01:10:18.156 --> 01:10:21.034
- from Mom's life insurance.
- She took out the policy for the girls.

01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:23.328
Man, I ain't have nothing
to do with that. Come on.

01:10:23.536 --> 01:10:25.789
- You made the payments!
- Good timing, Jerry.

01:10:25.997 --> 01:10:27.582
Just when it seems like
all is lost for you,

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:30.335
Mom gets shot by some gangsters
and now you hit the fucking lottery!

01:10:30.543 --> 01:10:33.797
So y'all...? Y'all tripping
because I made insurance payments?

01:10:34.005 --> 01:10:36.508
What? I paid all her bills!

01:10:39.719 --> 01:10:40.887
Where the fuck were y'all?

01:10:42.931 --> 01:10:45.809
How many years did I have
to take care of her my goddamn self?

01:10:46.017 --> 01:10:48.728
Y'all were around doing nothing!
Bullshitting!

01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:51.439
And you gonna tell me I killed her?
Come on, man!

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.566
So why would you pay off
a killer like Sweet?

01:10:53.775 --> 01:10:55.777
And what the fuck
did he do for you, Jerry?

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:58.488
What did he do for me?
He killed my fucking life!

01:10:58.697 --> 01:11:00.198
I put everything in that project!

01:11:00.407 --> 01:11:02.617
I bet it all trying to make
something of myself!

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:03.952
Trying to make the shit work!

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.079
Then Vic's goons gonna
come try to take a piece.

01:11:06.287 --> 01:11:08.081
You paid him, Jerry.
You got in bed with him.

01:11:08.248 --> 01:11:10.834
No, no, I didn't pay them! That's
how they fucking shut me down!

01:11:11.042 --> 01:11:12.252
I thought the city cut you off.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.337
Douglas? Come on, man.
This is Detroit!

01:11:14.546 --> 01:11:17.424
Sweet owns Douglas! He ain't nothing
but a gangster in a suit!

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:19.426
I don't pay him,
and now he shuts my loans off!

01:11:19.634 --> 01:11:22.262
- End of story, end of project.
- So, what about the 20 grand?

01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:25.598
I just told you. You wanna cross
the bridge, you gotta pay the toll.

01:11:25.807 --> 01:11:28.059
I took the money. I was gonna pay
the bribe until y'all fucked it up.

01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:28.560
I took the money. I was gonna pay
the bribe until y'all fucked it up.

01:11:28.768 --> 01:11:29.936
Your mother was a whore!

01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:33.106
Hey, fuck you, man! I will kick your...

01:11:35.942 --> 01:11:37.193
It's all about Jerry, right?

01:11:37.402 --> 01:11:39.154
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!

01:11:39.612 --> 01:11:41.531
Jack. Jack!

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.997
Jack!

01:11:58.048 --> 01:11:59.799
Shit.

01:12:03.928 --> 01:12:07.057
Shit! Get down!
Get the fuck down!

01:12:07.265 --> 01:12:09.309
- Come on! Get down!
- Jack! Bobby!

01:12:14.606 --> 01:12:15.982
Shit!

01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:22.405
- Bobby!
- Jack.

01:12:22.614 --> 01:12:24.407
- Bobby!
- Jack!

01:12:27.327 --> 01:12:28.995
Sofi, give me the gun!

01:12:50.308 --> 01:12:52.018
- Bobby!
- Jack, hold on!

01:13:04.864 --> 01:13:06.449
Shit!

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.955
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:16.167
He's behind the bricks!
Jackhammer!

01:13:23.883 --> 01:13:25.802
Jeremiah, where are you going?

01:13:26.678 --> 01:13:28.054
Jack!

01:13:33.268 --> 01:13:35.395
I got kids! A wife.

01:13:36.855 --> 01:13:38.732
A family.

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:19.105
Oh, shit.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.025
Fuck.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.162
Motherfucker!

01:14:42.796 --> 01:14:44.172
You fucking...

01:14:58.812 --> 01:15:00.230
Bobby!

01:15:00.605 --> 01:15:02.983
Bobby! Bobby!

01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:04.526
The van! Watch out!

01:15:11.324 --> 01:15:13.326
Jack! Jack, look at me!

01:15:13.493 --> 01:15:15.286
Jack, you all right? Hold on.

01:15:15.495 --> 01:15:17.747
We need an ambulance!

01:15:18.957 --> 01:15:21.334
Somebody help! Call 911!

01:15:21.835 --> 01:15:24.170
Jack. Jack.

01:15:24.379 --> 01:15:25.672
Jack!

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.507
Jack, please.

01:15:27.716 --> 01:15:29.342
- Come on, man.
- I'm calling, I'm calling.

01:15:29.551 --> 01:15:32.304
- Come on, Jack, you gotta breathe!
- We need an ambulance right now!

01:15:32.512 --> 01:15:35.974
Don't you die on me, you little fairy.
Come on, Jack. Please!

01:15:36.182 --> 01:15:38.518
You gotta fucking breathe!
Come on!

01:15:43.648 --> 01:15:45.191
Jack!

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.776
Jack.

01:15:46.985 --> 01:15:50.947
Jack, come on, Jack, please!

01:15:51.364 --> 01:15:52.907
Please...

01:15:54.576 --> 01:15:55.785
Jack.

01:16:16.056 --> 01:16:20.185
- Who sent you? Victor Sweet?
- Yeah. Yeah, it was Sweet.

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:22.646
Thank God.

01:16:22.854 --> 01:16:24.856
Thank God?

01:16:25.357 --> 01:16:27.859
He killed my mother and my little
brother, you motherfucker!

01:16:28.068 --> 01:16:30.278
Thank Victor Sweet.

01:16:32.405 --> 01:16:34.824
Photograph them.

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:40.246
Hey, let me talk to them, okay?

01:16:42.916 --> 01:16:44.834
Look, I'm real sorry, man.

01:16:45.043 --> 01:16:46.836
I really am.

01:16:47.045 --> 01:16:49.047
But what happened here?

01:16:49.255 --> 01:16:51.257
Victor Sweet did this.

01:16:51.424 --> 01:16:52.509
How do you figure that?

01:16:52.717 --> 01:16:54.511
Because his friend in the bag
over there told me.

01:16:54.719 --> 01:16:57.222
Okay, I'll make sure I get
a statement from him then.

01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:59.933
Why did Sweet do us like this, man?

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.727
And why did it have
to be our moms?

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.856
Because Evelyn was going after him.

01:17:07.232 --> 01:17:09.234
She knew her son, man.

01:17:09.442 --> 01:17:12.195
She never thought for a second
that you were corrupt.

01:17:12.404 --> 01:17:14.406
But I never told her
about my business.

01:17:14.614 --> 01:17:17.200
Jerry, were you ever able
to keep a secret from her?

01:17:17.409 --> 01:17:19.953
She knew all about
your trouble, man.

01:17:20.161 --> 01:17:22.080
The moment they shut you down,
she went down there,

01:17:22.288 --> 01:17:26.251
- raising hell with the councilman.
- You gonna bury Sweet, or are we?

01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:30.797
Well, I got me...

01:17:32.132 --> 01:17:34.259
...a dirty uniform I gotta deal with first.
- What?

01:17:34.467 --> 01:17:37.971
You see, Evelyn filed a report that
got passed on to Victor Sweet.

01:17:38.179 --> 01:17:39.973
- By who?
- Look, I just got something I...

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:43.268
Don't bullshit me, Green.
Who are you protecting?

01:17:43.476 --> 01:17:46.896
- Your boy Fowler?
- Look, Fowler's my problem!

01:17:47.105 --> 01:17:50.984
I'll deal with him.
And then we get Sweet.

01:17:53.361 --> 01:17:55.113
Green.

01:17:55.739 --> 01:17:57.657
So how we gonna deal
with all this?

01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:00.076
Self-defense.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.746
Wasn't it?

01:18:05.874 --> 01:18:07.792
Hey.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.462
What's happening, partner?

01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:12.297
What's cooking, boss?

01:18:14.382 --> 01:18:17.344
Isn't this one
of Victor Sweet's spots?

01:18:18.553 --> 01:18:20.513
Yeah, I heard that.

01:18:21.306 --> 01:18:23.266
So what?

01:18:25.018 --> 01:18:28.188
So why ain't you tell me
that you had talked to Evelyn Mercer

01:18:28.355 --> 01:18:30.649
a week before she got killed?

01:18:30.857 --> 01:18:33.902
I mean, don't you think that that's
relevant to a murder investigation?

01:18:34.861 --> 01:18:36.404
I didn't tell you

01:18:36.613 --> 01:18:39.366
because it wasn't relevant at all.

01:18:39.866 --> 01:18:41.868
- Really?
- Yeah, I talked to the old lady...

01:18:43.036 --> 01:18:44.871
...for all of about five minutes.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.956
She came in with her usual medley.

01:18:47.165 --> 01:18:49.417
Kids tagging up her block,
that kind of shit.

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:57.300
You know, I figured
it was something like that.

01:18:57.509 --> 01:18:59.636
But you still should have
said something to me, man.

01:18:59.844 --> 01:19:01.596
Sorry.

01:19:02.639 --> 01:19:04.307
Did she file a police report?

01:19:04.516 --> 01:19:07.352
No. I sent it over
to the Parks Department.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.896
They clean that shit up.

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:13.316
- Five minutes, huh?
- Yeah.

01:19:13.525 --> 01:19:15.986
Couldn't have been
much more than that.

01:19:19.197 --> 01:19:21.449
You wanna take a shot?
You're gonna need some practice.

01:19:22.409 --> 01:19:24.369
I'd love to.

01:19:31.876 --> 01:19:35.171
It's been a long time
since I played a game like this one.

01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:38.258
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

01:19:44.723 --> 01:19:47.851
Partner, I think your stick is crooked.

01:19:48.143 --> 01:19:50.312
I think it's all right.

01:19:52.439 --> 01:19:54.024
And the weight is off.

01:19:54.607 --> 01:19:56.318
Worked pretty good for me.

01:19:58.028 --> 01:19:59.696
You sure?

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.115
Yeah.

01:20:07.954 --> 01:20:09.998
You is a dirty cop!

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.499
Give me your badge.

01:20:11.708 --> 01:20:14.044
See, I hate dirty cops.

01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:17.964
Green, wait.

01:20:22.052 --> 01:20:24.137
Green, wait!
There is something I forgot.

01:20:24.346 --> 01:20:26.139
What? What the fuck
you wanna say to me?

01:20:30.101 --> 01:20:32.562
I forgot they installed those
surveillance cameras in the station.

01:20:32.771 --> 01:20:34.939
Motherfucker!

01:20:59.255 --> 01:21:02.175
Officer down! Officer down!
Green's been shot!

01:21:02.384 --> 01:21:06.137
I'm in the alleyway behind
John R and Seven Mile!

01:21:06.346 --> 01:21:09.975
Suspects are two young black males
heading east on foot!

01:21:10.183 --> 01:21:12.811
Request backup immediately!

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:18.358
Ready! Aim! Fire!

01:21:19.818 --> 01:21:23.697
Ready! Aim! Fire!

01:21:23.863 --> 01:21:26.741
Ready! Aim! Fire!

01:21:33.748 --> 01:21:35.500
Jackie.

01:21:49.306 --> 01:21:51.725
Never should have came home.

01:21:53.018 --> 01:21:55.228
Never should have came.

01:22:06.865 --> 01:22:09.284
I miss him too.

01:22:10.118 --> 01:22:11.494
We won't be able to bring him back,

01:22:11.703 --> 01:22:13.580
but we're gonna send him
some company.

01:22:13.788 --> 01:22:17.876
You can't go to war with Victor Sweet.
Not straight up.

01:22:18.168 --> 01:22:21.838
He'll just hire more and more
goons until we are all dead.

01:22:22.881 --> 01:22:24.549
I don't know.

01:22:24.758 --> 01:22:27.260
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:30.597
I already lost one brother.
You guys are all I got.

01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:37.604
- I got an idea.
- What?

01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:41.232
We'll take the rest of the money
from Mom's insurance,

01:22:41.441 --> 01:22:43.568
pay Sweet to call off the dogs.

01:22:43.777 --> 01:22:46.821
- He'll deal. He's a businessman.
- It doesn't count as a plan

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:49.282
if it takes you longer to say it
than it does to think it up.

01:22:49.491 --> 01:22:51.618
Yeah, Jerry.
Sweet will meet up with you,

01:22:51.826 --> 01:22:53.370
take your money.

01:22:53.578 --> 01:22:55.914
Won't be able to find your body
till the river thaws.

01:22:56.456 --> 01:22:58.583
If you can get that far.

01:23:11.721 --> 01:23:13.181
Jesus, Jeremiah,
what you doing here?

01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:15.100
I'm here to do a little
collective bargaining.

01:23:15.308 --> 01:23:17.519
What, with Sweet?
Did you not get the message?

01:23:19.813 --> 01:23:22.023
He wants blood.

01:23:22.232 --> 01:23:24.192
- That's not negotiable.
- Look, they told us

01:23:24.401 --> 01:23:27.946
we'd never get $30 an hour on the job
either, right? But what we get?

01:23:28.154 --> 01:23:30.240
So don't tell me this is not possible.
Come on, man.

01:23:30.448 --> 01:23:32.158
So, what you bringing to the table?

01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:36.371
Four hundred thousand dollars.

01:23:41.876 --> 01:23:43.461
Yo.

01:23:44.296 --> 01:23:46.798
- Evan called Sweet. He's going for it.
- So when's the meet?

01:23:47.007 --> 01:23:48.383
- Four o'clock.
- Today?

01:23:48.591 --> 01:23:49.843
- Yeah.
- That's in three hours.

01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:51.803
Well, we ain't got no choice!

01:23:52.012 --> 01:23:54.556
Sweet's supposed to roll up on us
any minute now.

01:23:54.764 --> 01:23:56.808
What? What else?

01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:01.187
Well, Evan, we cool.
And he let me in on a little something.

01:24:01.396 --> 01:24:03.440
If Fowler's there, he don't
think he's gonna go for it.

01:24:03.648 --> 01:24:07.110
- So there's no plan!
- Yes, there is, Bobby.

01:24:07.319 --> 01:24:09.195
We need to take Fowler out
before the meet.

01:24:09.362 --> 01:24:11.448
We can't kill a cop
even if he is dirty.

01:24:11.656 --> 01:24:15.201
He handed Ma to Sweet, okay?
He ain't walking away from this.

01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:30.592
Make sure the hole's cut
when we get there.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.219
Hey, come here.

01:24:33.803 --> 01:24:36.765
- All right. I love you.
- Now, don't get shot.

01:24:36.973 --> 01:24:38.308
- Don't shoot anyone either.
- Relax.

01:24:38.516 --> 01:24:40.185
Unless you have to.

01:24:40.727 --> 01:24:43.730
Come on, now.
You know I love you, don't you?

01:24:47.233 --> 01:24:50.570
Y'all be good now.
And take care of Mommy, all right?

01:24:56.451 --> 01:24:58.370
Be careful.

01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:00.664
I will.

01:25:01.539 --> 01:25:03.291
Bobby.

01:25:08.338 --> 01:25:10.632
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.719
but don't you let him get hurt.
You bring him back to me.

01:25:15.095 --> 01:25:16.471
I will, Camille.

01:25:17.639 --> 01:25:18.932
It's gonna be okay.

01:25:29.567 --> 01:25:31.444
Hey, kid!

01:25:31.778 --> 01:25:34.114
What you doing,
playing out here in the snow?

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.492
I'm just working on my swing
for the spring.

01:25:37.951 --> 01:25:40.328
Hey, man, I need a big favor.

01:25:40.537 --> 01:25:44.582
I'll give you $20
and this whole box of Baby Ruths.

01:25:48.503 --> 01:25:50.714
You see that house over there?

01:26:03.059 --> 01:26:05.103
Not till we hear from Angel.

01:26:22.579 --> 01:26:24.789
- What do you want?
- I'm selling candy to raise money

01:26:24.998 --> 01:26:28.710
for my baseball team. We wanna
buy new uniforms and equip...

01:26:28.918 --> 01:26:29.336
Thanks. Now get the hell out of here.

01:26:29.336 --> 01:26:31.087
Thanks. Now get the hell out of here.

01:26:33.298 --> 01:26:37.302
This is a big problem.
A big problem for you.

01:26:39.262 --> 01:26:41.514
Even a completely calm person
will suffocate

01:26:41.681 --> 01:26:43.933
in four minutes without oxygen.

01:26:44.142 --> 01:26:46.519
And you're not exactly calm,
are you?

01:26:46.686 --> 01:26:49.564
- Jerry!
- Fuck!

01:26:49.773 --> 01:26:51.191
We ain't going nowhere
without the call,

01:26:51.399 --> 01:26:52.984
- so just calm down.
- What the fuck you...?

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:56.655
- Jerry!
- Just keep stalling him.

01:26:56.863 --> 01:26:59.491
Hold... I'm grabbing my scarf, man.
I'll be there in a minute! Hold on.

01:26:59.699 --> 01:27:01.409
- Angel?
- Hey, I got him.

01:27:01.618 --> 01:27:03.578
- Is he out of the way?
- What, you wanna ask him?

01:27:03.787 --> 01:27:06.498
- Let me hear his voice.
- Hold on, let me put him on. Hold on.

01:27:06.706 --> 01:27:09.042
Hey, man, say hi to my brother.

01:27:09.834 --> 01:27:11.378
- We got you now, bitch.
- I'm coming.

01:27:11.586 --> 01:27:13.213
Go.

01:27:15.423 --> 01:27:17.926
Jerry, what the hell? You in there?

01:27:23.515 --> 01:27:26.643
- That's our money?
- Yeah.

01:27:30.438 --> 01:27:31.564
- Hey, man, hey!
- Relax, relax.

01:27:31.773 --> 01:27:34.734
- Hey, what is this, man? What is this?
- Relax, relax. Just relax.

01:27:34.901 --> 01:27:38.738
We just gotta check it out, make
sure you ain't strapped. Relax, relax.

01:27:38.947 --> 01:27:40.740
- He's good.
- Okay.

01:27:40.949 --> 01:27:43.118
Let's take a ride, Jerry.

01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:54.004
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Well, he's onboard, boss.

01:27:54.587 --> 01:27:56.464
Yeah, all right.

01:27:58.008 --> 01:27:59.259
What did he say?

01:27:59.467 --> 01:28:03.555
He say, "Hurry the fuck up."
Then he hung up.

01:28:06.725 --> 01:28:09.811
You'll never get the belt. Trust me.

01:28:15.025 --> 01:28:16.776
People never think to go for the bag.

01:28:16.985 --> 01:28:18.987
It's always the belt first
for some reason.

01:28:19.195 --> 01:28:22.532
The bag has to be clear, though.
Black doesn't work.

01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:27.203
Get up.

01:28:27.829 --> 01:28:28.872
Get over there right now.

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.500
- He's gonna end up dead.
- Ma'am, ma'am, slow it down a gear.

01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:35.879
And this isn't even his fight.
It's his stupid brother's fault!

01:28:36.087 --> 01:28:37.756
I understand. I can help you.

01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:40.508
But you're gonna have to let
me know who it is we're talking about

01:28:40.717 --> 01:28:43.261
- and what's about to happen.
- My boyfriend.

01:28:44.095 --> 01:28:47.474
He was talking about killing a cop.

01:29:20.382 --> 01:29:22.884
You hear that?
You know what that is?

01:29:23.093 --> 01:29:25.637
That's a damn beautiful sound.

01:29:25.845 --> 01:29:27.847
Those are my boys coming.

01:29:56.793 --> 01:29:59.045
So, what do we do now?

01:29:59.921 --> 01:30:01.756
We get out.

01:30:07.137 --> 01:30:10.015
Jesus Christ! What is that?
Wha...? What's that?

01:30:10.223 --> 01:30:14.227
It's ice fishing.
Tommy there is part Eskimo.

01:30:27.741 --> 01:30:29.367
No.

01:30:32.579 --> 01:30:34.164
It's not looking good
for you, homeboy.

01:30:34.581 --> 01:30:36.624
We'll see if they're still your boys
after they find out

01:30:36.833 --> 01:30:39.919
you killed your partner Green,
homeboy.

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.921
That's your angle, huh?

01:30:42.130 --> 01:30:45.425
You gonna walk out there
and tell them I killed Green.

01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:48.595
That's your story?

01:30:48.803 --> 01:30:51.264
- It has the advantage of being true.
- So what?

01:30:52.265 --> 01:30:54.476
I killed my partner.

01:30:55.685 --> 01:30:57.937
I could kill the whole
damn police department

01:30:58.146 --> 01:30:59.606
if you were the only witness.

01:31:00.231 --> 01:31:02.233
They'd probably just
promote me to chief.

01:31:02.442 --> 01:31:06.446
You're one of
the Mercer brothers, brother.

01:31:06.655 --> 01:31:09.824
No cop in the world's gonna
believe your word over mine. Sorry.

01:31:10.033 --> 01:31:12.452
You know what?
You're probably right.

01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:15.455
Other than the ones
I got outside right now in the van

01:31:15.664 --> 01:31:18.625
listening to every bit
of our conversation...

01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:21.002
...brother.

01:31:22.045 --> 01:31:23.129
You're lying.

01:31:24.547 --> 01:31:25.966
Afraid not.

01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:30.637
Take a look.

01:31:31.304 --> 01:31:32.764
I want eyes on the house!

01:31:32.973 --> 01:31:35.809
Okay, lieutenant, I'm bringing
him out now.

01:31:36.017 --> 01:31:38.645
Come on, man. It's all over.

01:31:44.484 --> 01:31:46.820
I'm gonna pop your head
like a champagne cork.

01:31:46.987 --> 01:31:49.489
You hear me?
I'm taking your clown down with me!

01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:24.357
Fool showed up.

01:32:24.774 --> 01:32:28.069
And they say there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

01:32:32.824 --> 01:32:34.159
All right.

01:32:34.367 --> 01:32:37.329
Let's sink this dumb-ass
and get out of here.

01:32:37.537 --> 01:32:40.540
I got a candlelit date lined up with
a hot piece of Puerto Rican pussy.

01:32:51.009 --> 01:32:54.054
Jeremiah Mercer. Businessman.

01:32:55.388 --> 01:32:57.474
Give me that.

01:33:09.194 --> 01:33:12.405
Goddamn it, I like the way
you do business!

01:33:13.573 --> 01:33:15.450
You're a reasonable man.

01:33:15.659 --> 01:33:17.661
You should have let me in
on your project.

01:33:17.869 --> 01:33:19.829
We could have been partners.

01:33:20.038 --> 01:33:23.500
Could have been a sweet deal
for both of us.

01:33:23.708 --> 01:33:25.835
Now it just a sweet deal for me.

01:33:26.044 --> 01:33:28.630
Come on, man.
We gonna do business, or what?

01:33:30.674 --> 01:33:32.342
Right.

01:33:35.053 --> 01:33:37.430
Right. Right.

01:33:37.639 --> 01:33:38.682
Down to business.

01:33:39.265 --> 01:33:41.101
What were the...?

01:33:41.267 --> 01:33:42.894
What were the terms again?

01:33:44.312 --> 01:33:45.814
You give me 400 grand,

01:33:46.314 --> 01:33:50.151
and I pardon you and your brothers,
is that right? Forgive and forget, right?

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.403
That's right.

01:33:51.945 --> 01:33:54.280
My brothers said I was naive.
That you would shoot me

01:33:54.489 --> 01:33:56.866
and just take the money. Yeah.

01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.121
- Damn, man, you hurt my feelings.
- Good.

01:34:02.122 --> 01:34:04.624
Because you don't know shit
about hurt feelings.

01:34:07.294 --> 01:34:09.838
I just buried my mama
and my brother.

01:34:10.046 --> 01:34:12.299
And I think that's
payment enough, Vic.

01:34:13.633 --> 01:34:16.052
You been doing a lot
of thinking, boy.

01:34:16.886 --> 01:34:19.389
Yeah, my mama raised me
to be a thinking man.

01:34:19.597 --> 01:34:21.850
So me and my brothers, we came up
with a whole new proposal.

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.396
- A whole new proposal. Is that right?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:34:26.604 --> 01:34:29.858
You gonna like it too. Because it is a...
A sweet deal.

01:34:30.608 --> 01:34:33.820
Check it out. Instead of giving you
the 400 grand, we decided

01:34:34.029 --> 01:34:36.865
we'd give it to these mistreated
workers you got standing behind you.

01:34:38.533 --> 01:34:39.659
Pistol.

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:43.413
- Evan, I said pistol!
- No, bitch.

01:34:43.621 --> 01:34:46.583
The one thing you forgot
about me is this:

01:34:46.791 --> 01:34:49.794
I was in the union for a long time.

01:34:50.253 --> 01:34:53.006
I ain't never missed no meetings.

01:34:53.506 --> 01:34:54.674
He ain't lying.

01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:57.510
It's cold out here when you
by yourself, ain't it?

01:35:01.973 --> 01:35:04.017
So, what now?

01:35:06.061 --> 01:35:09.022
You gonna kill the hand
that's been feeding you?

01:35:10.231 --> 01:35:13.610
- Over some stupid old lady?
- Watch your motherfucking mouth.

01:35:14.402 --> 01:35:16.112
You dumb shits!

01:35:19.699 --> 01:35:24.412
I told Fowler and his pals
all about this meeting!

01:35:25.205 --> 01:35:28.875
You kill me, you all go down!
Murder!

01:35:30.752 --> 01:35:32.337
He's already late.

01:35:32.545 --> 01:35:34.422
Shit, he's probably on his way
right now.

01:35:35.507 --> 01:35:36.800
He ain't coming.

01:35:39.135 --> 01:35:42.389
- Come out!
- I swear to God, I'll kill him!

01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.059
You guys set me up, huh?

01:35:46.476 --> 01:35:50.021
You think you're real smart,
getting this shit on tape, huh?

01:35:50.230 --> 01:35:51.523
- Fowler?
- What the hell?

01:35:51.731 --> 01:35:54.109
- I thought Fowler was the hostage.
- Back off! I'm serious!

01:35:54.317 --> 01:35:56.945
- Fowler, what are you doing, man?
- Drop the goddamn gun!

01:35:57.153 --> 01:35:59.406
- We're here to help you!
- Back off now! I'm serious!

01:35:59.614 --> 01:36:02.075
That's right.
Fowler, put down your weapon!

01:36:02.283 --> 01:36:03.326
Not a chance!

01:36:04.411 --> 01:36:06.329
I said, back off! Now!

01:36:08.707 --> 01:36:09.916
Drop your weapon!

01:36:15.297 --> 01:36:17.215
He's down!

01:36:17.757 --> 01:36:20.093
Man down! Man down! EMS!

01:36:20.927 --> 01:36:22.429
- Call it in!
- Get on the horn!

01:36:27.851 --> 01:36:29.519
Come on now.
Who's gonna do it, huh?

01:36:31.187 --> 01:36:33.690
Who the man here, huh?

01:36:33.898 --> 01:36:36.609
Which one of you tough guys
gonna do it?

01:36:37.485 --> 01:36:41.448
Who's gonna take on the champ?
You, Charlie?

01:37:01.092 --> 01:37:02.886
Yeah. That's right.

01:37:03.428 --> 01:37:05.472
Is this who I think it is?

01:37:07.098 --> 01:37:09.684
Is this what you all been waiting on?

01:37:09.893 --> 01:37:11.561
- You all right, Jerry?
- Yeah, I'm straight.

01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:15.398
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, Bobby Mercer.

01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:17.359
Back in town.

01:37:17.567 --> 01:37:19.319
- You gonna be the one, man?
- Come on, Bobby.

01:37:19.486 --> 01:37:21.154
Bring it on, baby. What you got?

01:37:21.905 --> 01:37:23.573
Watch his hands, Bobby.

01:37:23.782 --> 01:37:25.617
You better say a prayer, man.

01:37:26.951 --> 01:37:28.745
- Get him, champ.
- Come on!

01:37:29.287 --> 01:37:30.705
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

01:37:30.914 --> 01:37:33.166
Come on, kick his ass!

01:37:33.375 --> 01:37:35.710
- Come on, that's it! Come on!
- Hit him hard! Bobby, hit him!

01:37:40.632 --> 01:37:43.802
- Get your ass up! Come on!
- Get him!

01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:47.222
- All right, you got him! You got him!
- Put that shit away, man. Come on.

01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:48.723
Yeah, come on, man!

01:37:54.854 --> 01:37:56.356
Take him out, boy!

01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:01.403
Get back. Get back.

01:38:04.197 --> 01:38:06.032
That's it!

01:38:09.285 --> 01:38:11.830
- Good night, man!
- That's it! All right, come on, man.

01:38:12.455 --> 01:38:14.124
It's over now, Bobby.

01:38:14.833 --> 01:38:17.002
- Elbow, baby, elbow!
- Turn it around, man!

01:38:19.754 --> 01:38:22.299
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Get him!
Come on!

01:38:25.385 --> 01:38:27.053
Fucker!

01:38:27.762 --> 01:38:30.181
Hey, get up, bitch! Get up!

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.561
- Motherfuck!
- Get your bitch ass back in there!

01:38:34.728 --> 01:38:36.229
Get him back here!

01:38:41.568 --> 01:38:42.819
Yeah!

01:38:43.278 --> 01:38:44.446
That's what's up!

01:38:57.375 --> 01:38:58.877
- Get him in the hole.
- That's right.

01:38:59.085 --> 01:39:01.421
Way to go, Bobby.

01:39:14.643 --> 01:39:16.061
So, what we gonna do
about the police?

01:39:16.269 --> 01:39:17.270
Police?

01:39:17.479 --> 01:39:19.522
Cops love the Mercers, Jerry.

01:39:20.690 --> 01:39:23.318
- Sit him down.
- Damn! You girls are trying to kill me!

01:39:23.526 --> 01:39:25.278
What are you doing, man? All right!

01:39:26.279 --> 01:39:27.614
You wanna go another round, huh?

01:39:27.781 --> 01:39:30.617
You arrested him,
and he didn't do anything!

01:39:30.784 --> 01:39:31.868
Let me ask you again.

01:39:32.077 --> 01:39:33.953
What happened to Victor Sweet,
Mercer?

01:39:34.162 --> 01:39:36.289
His name is Jeremiah Mercer,
and I wanna see him now!

01:39:36.498 --> 01:39:38.708
Ellis, you might wanna close your ears.
This is nasty shit.

01:39:38.917 --> 01:39:42.462
That's what you wanna hear? I did it.
I did it, okay?

01:39:42.671 --> 01:39:44.297
If you did it,
then I wanna hear you say it!

01:39:44.506 --> 01:39:47.467
From about 5:30 p.m. Till
about 11 or so last night,

01:39:47.634 --> 01:39:51.513
I was banging that pretty little wife
of yours, okay? Here's the...

01:39:54.307 --> 01:39:57.602
I was bumping uglies with your wife.

01:39:58.103 --> 01:40:00.563
Your mama, she wasn't good
the first time.

01:40:01.022 --> 01:40:03.483
- That true? What do you got now?
- Your hair, scumbag!

01:40:03.692 --> 01:40:05.986
Taken off Victor Sweet's dead body.

01:40:08.822 --> 01:40:11.324
Don't push him like that!

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.493
Oh, baby! Oh, my God!

01:40:14.119 --> 01:40:15.870
Are you okay?

01:40:16.079 --> 01:40:18.123
- I'm okay, baby.
- They bought it, baby.

01:40:18.331 --> 01:40:20.083
- They bought it.
- Let me see. Come here.

01:40:20.291 --> 01:40:21.376
- It's all right.
- Let me see.

01:40:21.584 --> 01:40:23.378
- It's just a boo-boo.
- It's not just a boo-boo!

01:40:23.586 --> 01:40:25.088
Somebody put their fist in your eye!

01:40:25.297 --> 01:40:26.756
- Let me see it!
- Come on, now.

01:40:26.965 --> 01:40:28.341
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:40:28.508 --> 01:40:31.428
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding, baby.
- You know I can take a punch.

01:40:31.636 --> 01:40:33.930
I know you can take a punch.

01:40:34.139 --> 01:40:37.517
- You don't talk about peoples mamas!
- Well, he talked about mine.

01:40:37.684 --> 01:40:40.353
- Did you get some licks in?
- Of course.

01:40:40.562 --> 01:40:43.565
- Does his eye look like yours?
- Hey, man, where's Bobby?

01:40:43.773 --> 01:40:45.608
Let me catch you on the street
without that badge.

01:40:45.817 --> 01:40:47.319
I'll smack that smirk
off your face, punk!

01:40:47.527 --> 01:40:51.281
I'm gonna smack you, Bobby.
I told you not to let Jerry get hurt.

01:40:51.489 --> 01:40:52.490
He's breathing.

01:40:52.699 --> 01:40:54.826
- You all right, Jerry?
- I'm all right, man.

01:40:55.035 --> 01:40:57.370
Let me get my property.

01:40:58.872 --> 01:41:01.791
- Man, you all right?
- I'm good.

01:41:03.376 --> 01:41:04.961
You said something,
didn't you, Jerry?

01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:06.338
I did not say nothing, man.

01:41:06.546 --> 01:41:08.006
- Why you always...?
- I did.

01:41:08.214 --> 01:41:11.593
- What you say?
- I told him I was banging his wife.

01:41:13.386 --> 01:41:15.639
- Come on, man!
- I did too.

01:41:15.847 --> 01:41:17.849
Me too.

01:41:19.184 --> 01:41:21.686
Okay, pass the ball, guys!
Pass the ball.

01:41:24.898 --> 01:41:27.150
Yeah, yeah. I got you, I got you.

01:41:29.319 --> 01:41:31.321
Guys, right here, right here.

01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:59.432
Got one window in.

01:42:00.433 --> 01:42:04.270
All right. Let's keep it going,
come on.

01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:10.860
Okay, okay. No more work for today.

01:42:11.069 --> 01:42:14.447
That's right. Come in the house.
Wash your hands.

01:42:15.365 --> 01:42:17.826
- Dang! A little to eat.
- Time to eat. I'm starving.

01:42:18.034 --> 01:42:19.160
What did you cook?

01:42:19.369 --> 01:42:21.287
You too, girls, come on.

01:42:21.454 --> 01:42:23.540
Come on, babies.

01:42:37.262 --> 01:42:39.055
Here you go.

01:42:39.264 --> 01:42:41.266
Evelyn isn't coming back, is she?

01:42:42.225 --> 01:42:44.269
No, she's not coming back.

01:42:44.477 --> 01:42:46.813
Because she's dead, huh?

01:42:48.398 --> 01:42:51.568
Yeah. It's because she's dead.

01:42:52.402 --> 01:42:54.821
You guys have fun, all right?
No rough stuff.

01:43:02.871 --> 01:43:06.583
Always so good to have
you back home, son.

01:43:07.167 --> 01:43:09.794
You gonna stick around
a little while this time?

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.257
I'm thinking about it, Ma.
I'm thinking about it.

01:43:16.551 --> 01:43:19.137
Oh, Bobby.

01:44:01.554 --> 01:44:03.390
- Mercer!
- Yeah, Bobby!

01:44:05.266 --> 01:44:08.895
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:44:09.104 --> 01:44:10.730
Yeah!

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.528
Come on, now. Come on.
Did you have to push?

01:44:16.736 --> 01:44:18.571
Hold up! Hold up!

01:44:18.738 --> 01:44:21.700
If we don't work, nobody work!
Get back!

01:44:32.377 --> 01:44:35.672
I'm sorry, Mr. Wong, your credit card
has been reported stolen.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.550
Stolen? Madam, you know what,
them my uncles right there.

01:44:38.758 --> 01:44:43.471
- Tyrone Wong, help me out real quick.
- Mr. Wong! Mr. Wong! Mr. Wong!

01:45:02.282 --> 01:45:05.410
You keep sayin'
The world is gonna end

01:45:05.618 --> 01:45:09.331
You keep sayin'
The world is gonna end
