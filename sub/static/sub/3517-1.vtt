02:49.858 --> 02:52.486
We could jump in the car, if...

02:52.611 --> 02:54.404
We'll wait.

02:56.323 --> 02:57.532
Did you get the congressman

02:57.532 --> 02:59.534
- anything for his birthday?
- No.

02:59.951 --> 03:01.995
I got him cuff links.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.623
- Silver, with his...
- We don't talk about birthdays.

03:04.664 --> 03:07.084
- We don't do gifts.
- Why not?

03:07.584 --> 03:09.878
You should return the cuff links.

03:10.003 --> 03:11.588
Doug.

03:12.005 --> 03:13.715
Tried calling you.

03:13.757 --> 03:16.009
- I left my phone in the...
- We need to talk.

03:19.638 --> 03:21.765
- What's going on?
- Christina.

03:21.807 --> 03:24.226
- I just spoke to her.
- Did Zoe?

03:24.267 --> 03:25.852
Yeah, and that's not all.

03:25.894 --> 03:27.562
They tracked down Rachel, too.

03:27.687 --> 03:29.105
Francis.

03:29.898 --> 03:31.650
Tell me about Rachel.

03:31.817 --> 03:32.818
Where is she?

03:32.818 --> 03:34.236
I have her under control.

03:34.361 --> 03:35.737
That's not what I asked.

03:35.987 --> 03:37.447
I drove her home.

03:37.572 --> 03:38.824
We don't have to worry about her.

03:38.865 --> 03:40.826
You said the same about Ms. Skorsky.

03:42.244 --> 03:43.912
Anyone else involved?

03:43.954 --> 03:45.330
Just Janine and Zoe.

03:45.372 --> 03:46.665
They asked about Russo's arrest,

03:46.665 --> 03:48.250
and they know he went to see Kapeniak.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.252
I assume that's as far as they've gotten.

03:50.293 --> 03:51.878
Assume nothing.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.338
I'll alert Barney Hull.

03:53.588 --> 03:56.132
- What do you want me to do about Zoe?
- I'll handle Zoe.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.426
- Get to work.
- Yes, sir.

04:11.356 --> 04:12.816
I emptied it.

04:13.441 --> 04:15.694
You're another year older on Tuesday.

04:15.777 --> 04:18.613
And we can't have a vice
president who smokes.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.710
- Can you finish?
- What?

04:32.544 --> 04:34.296
I'm good.

04:35.046 --> 04:36.673
What's wrong?

04:36.965 --> 04:39.050
Nothing. I just said finish.

04:39.092 --> 04:41.469
Well, I don't want to
just... if you're not...

04:41.595 --> 04:43.680
Ok, fine.

04:43.722 --> 04:44.764
Whatever.

04:47.642 --> 04:49.603
Zoe, did I do something that made you... ?

04:49.644 --> 04:50.395
No.

04:51.730 --> 04:53.231
Zoe, you can't say something like

04:53.273 --> 04:56.026
"just finish" and then shut down.

05:03.199 --> 05:06.244
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.

05:14.169 --> 05:16.379
Good morning, Jackie.

05:17.714 --> 05:19.716
Good morning.

05:22.218 --> 05:23.386
Richard Russell?

05:23.428 --> 05:25.889
Civil Rights Act, 1963.

05:26.181 --> 05:28.350
Not everyone can be on
the right side of history.

05:28.350 --> 05:29.976
Not even Lyndon for a time,

05:30.018 --> 05:32.562
but he would've never become
majority leader without him.

05:33.021 --> 05:35.023
Well, there's no Johnson Senate building.

05:35.065 --> 05:37.901
No, he had to settle for
a presidential library.

05:38.401 --> 05:39.569
So it's been some time

05:39.611 --> 05:41.237
since you and I have
had a chance to catch up.

05:41.279 --> 05:43.239
You've been an outstanding deputy, Jackie.

05:43.239 --> 05:45.950
Far more effective than your
more seasoned colleagues.

05:46.076 --> 05:47.327
You're a coalition builder,

05:47.327 --> 05:48.912
a fighter when you have to be.

05:49.579 --> 05:51.956
Tell me, where do you see yourself headed?

05:53.374 --> 05:56.377
I'd like to aim for the
chair of Armed Services.

05:56.377 --> 05:57.879
Or Homeland Security.

05:58.088 --> 06:00.507
Have you ever considered
serving in the leadership?

06:01.508 --> 06:03.718
I figure that might be possible eight,

06:03.760 --> 06:04.677
ten years from now.

06:04.719 --> 06:06.888
What if I suggested that you
could serve in the leadership

06:06.888 --> 06:08.348
this term?

06:08.681 --> 06:10.183
To replace me,

06:10.433 --> 06:11.309
as whip.

06:13.394 --> 06:14.938
You're being tapped for VP.

06:14.979 --> 06:16.523
Let's assume that's true.

06:17.190 --> 06:18.316
That makes sense,

06:18.358 --> 06:20.193
but me as whip?

06:20.276 --> 06:20.985
Yes.

06:21.236 --> 06:22.654
A third-term congresswoman?

06:22.695 --> 06:24.239
A universally admired incumbent

06:24.239 --> 06:27.283
who also happens to be a war veteran.

06:27.325 --> 06:28.785
Webb is next in line.

06:28.827 --> 06:30.245
Or Buchwalter.

06:30.787 --> 06:31.955
Mmm-hmm.

06:32.580 --> 06:35.500
So just consider that for a moment.

06:39.129 --> 06:41.089
They'll draw votes from one another.

06:42.131 --> 06:44.092
Oh, I'm not saying you
wouldn't have to fight for it.

06:44.092 --> 06:46.135
But I'd be willing to
give you the ammunition.

06:48.137 --> 06:49.889
Come over here.

06:55.770 --> 06:57.313
What is this?

06:57.689 --> 07:00.483
My files on Webb and Buchwalter.

07:00.608 --> 07:02.026
Why don't you take a look?

07:02.235 --> 07:04.195
We'll speak in a few days.

07:04.654 --> 07:06.573
Oh, and there's one on you.

07:06.614 --> 07:09.117
You might wanna begin by
reading that one first.

07:31.055 --> 07:32.515
What'd Janine say?

07:32.557 --> 07:34.309
Strip club's not open yet.

07:34.684 --> 07:36.352
You look into Kapeniak?

07:36.477 --> 07:38.229
If he's on the grid, I'll find him.

07:40.273 --> 07:41.733
Drop me at Metro Center.

07:41.816 --> 07:43.026
Not the office?

07:43.735 --> 07:45.653
I'm gonna talk to Rachel.

07:46.112 --> 07:47.155
She'll deny everything,

07:47.196 --> 07:48.406
like she did last night.

07:48.406 --> 07:51.492
She can't deny getting into
Stamper's car. You saw her.

07:52.785 --> 07:55.413
Maybe you send a version
of the story about her dad.

07:55.705 --> 07:57.415
No one would print it.

07:57.874 --> 07:59.751
Rachel doesn't know that.

07:59.834 --> 08:01.878
She said, "Go to town, bitch."

08:01.919 --> 08:04.505
It won't work. I have to get in her face.

08:09.844 --> 08:11.179
Congratulations.

08:13.139 --> 08:14.891
- We're thrilled for you.
- Thank you.

08:14.891 --> 08:16.851
I wanted to fill in Bob
and Terry personally.

08:16.976 --> 08:18.394
Now, let's get to it.

08:18.519 --> 08:20.688
- I have to leave for Pittsburgh in what?
- Twenty minutes.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.815
Homestretch with Jim. Whistle-stop tour.

08:22.815 --> 08:23.858
Looking good out there.

08:23.858 --> 08:25.735
Very good, but we don't
want to take any chances.

08:25.777 --> 08:27.487
Now, your replacement as whip, Frank.

08:27.612 --> 08:29.280
Bob has already shared some thoughts.

08:29.364 --> 08:31.866
- I like Howard Webb.
- Webb is a solid choice.

08:31.866 --> 08:33.326
Have you thought about Wes Buchwalter?

08:33.368 --> 08:34.744
Buchwalter's a hothead.

08:34.827 --> 08:36.578
Well, could you live with Webb, Frank?

08:36.788 --> 08:38.289
Webb is a good tactician,

08:38.331 --> 08:39.582
but he lacks follow-through.

08:39.624 --> 08:40.957
The problem with Buchwalter is,

08:40.957 --> 08:43.544
he's too abrasive. No
charm. Lots of enemies.

08:43.586 --> 08:44.670
Is there a third option?

08:44.670 --> 08:47.256
They're the two most senior members
in the caucus. It's their turn.

08:47.298 --> 08:49.384
Mr. President, what if
we let the caucus pick?

08:49.425 --> 08:50.802
Let it be a wide open race.

08:50.843 --> 08:52.053
Both men are qualified.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.805
The leadership should be united in this.

08:53.805 --> 08:55.473
We don't want to be backing
different candidates.

08:55.473 --> 08:57.850
So we stay out of it, and
neither of us backs anyone.

08:57.892 --> 08:58.518
I like it.

08:58.559 --> 08:59.852
The caucus will respect someone who

08:59.852 --> 09:01.229
did it the old-fashioned way.

09:01.687 --> 09:03.815
Well, gentlemen,
it's your call to make.

09:03.898 --> 09:05.233
Figure it out amongst yourselves,

09:05.274 --> 09:07.610
- let me know what you decide.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

09:09.028 --> 09:10.905
Put me through to Secretary Lewis.

09:11.739 --> 09:14.242
Frank, I don't want to go
to battle with you on this.

09:14.242 --> 09:16.452
- We've been down that road.
- I couldn't agree more.

09:16.494 --> 09:17.912
An open race makes me nervous.

09:17.912 --> 09:19.914
Look, it was just a suggestion.

09:20.498 --> 09:23.167
- I'll put some thought into it.
- Thank you.

09:25.378 --> 09:27.713
You know, let me... let me go work on him.

09:27.755 --> 09:29.549
Well, good luck.

09:41.769 --> 09:43.229
What are you doing here?

09:43.271 --> 09:45.481
Ask me what I want to order.

09:52.196 --> 09:53.447
Have you decided, sir?

09:53.447 --> 09:54.782
I need you to quit your job.

09:54.782 --> 09:56.409
Tell Leon it's your last day.

09:56.784 --> 09:57.869
Why?

09:57.994 --> 09:59.662
Act normal.

10:03.249 --> 10:05.459
- Would you want a side with that?
- They found you once.

10:05.501 --> 10:07.169
We can't take the chance
they'll find you again.

10:07.169 --> 10:09.839
- What am I supposed to do about money?
- Do as I say.

10:10.006 --> 10:11.966
Go home and pack your things.

10:12.091 --> 10:13.384
I'll come by around ten.

10:13.384 --> 10:15.386
- I don't get a say in any... ?
- Stop it.

10:21.684 --> 10:24.145
One suitcase. That's it.

10:24.395 --> 10:26.355
- Can you at least tell me... ?
- I'll take the shepherd's pie

10:26.355 --> 10:28.274
with a side of brussels sprouts.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.109
To go.

10:31.861 --> 10:33.321
We don't want a trial,

10:33.362 --> 10:34.822
her lawyers don't want a trial,

10:34.864 --> 10:36.699
but Ms. Cole won't listen to reason.

10:36.824 --> 10:38.826
That said, if you give
me a little more time...

10:38.826 --> 10:39.702
If she wants to go to court,

10:39.744 --> 10:40.786
then let's give her that.

10:40.828 --> 10:43.039
Just because she's being
unreasonable now doesn't mean...

10:43.080 --> 10:43.956
- she's...
- I'm done.

10:43.998 --> 10:45.499
That's a knee-jerk reaction.

10:45.541 --> 10:48.586
I've never known you to be a person
who is irrational or impatient.

10:48.628 --> 10:49.921
Let me check back with her lawyers...

10:49.921 --> 10:52.048
What's the soonest we can get a trial date?

10:52.089 --> 10:53.966
- Claire.
- Give me a time frame.

10:54.216 --> 10:56.344
Six months, at the earliest.

10:59.055 --> 11:00.514
Inform her people.

11:00.556 --> 11:03.017
Then no more communication.

11:03.476 --> 11:05.186
As your counsel, it is my duty

11:05.186 --> 11:07.146
to strongly advise you against this.

11:07.355 --> 11:09.732
I understand and I thank you, Oliver.

11:13.778 --> 11:15.154
Thank you.

11:16.405 --> 11:17.365
So?

11:17.406 --> 11:19.784
They wouldn't give me
individual contact info,

11:19.825 --> 11:21.535
but here's every doctor

11:21.535 --> 11:24.038
who served in East Africa
during the last three years.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.414
And what about the HMO?

11:25.456 --> 11:26.874
You need a consent form.

11:26.916 --> 11:28.209
It's in the packet.

11:39.470 --> 11:40.680
Can I help you?

11:41.222 --> 11:43.766
Yeah, I'm looking for Rachel Posner.

11:43.891 --> 11:45.684
She's not here.

11:45.726 --> 11:48.270
- Is she coming in later?
- Why?

11:48.687 --> 11:50.189
I know her.

11:50.314 --> 11:52.483
Well, your friend really screwed me over.

11:52.525 --> 11:53.609
What happened?

11:53.651 --> 11:56.112
She took off, middle of her shift.

11:56.445 --> 11:58.906
I had to put my hostess on waitstaff duty.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.699
Look, I'm concerned.

12:00.699 --> 12:02.326
Rachel's in real trouble.

12:02.368 --> 12:04.286
I don't care what her personal issues are.

12:04.328 --> 12:05.746
I need to know where she lives.

12:05.788 --> 12:06.789
I thought you knew her.

12:06.831 --> 12:09.667
I do. It's just been a while and...

12:09.792 --> 12:13.003
she sent me a text message saying
she wants to hurt herself, and

12:13.087 --> 12:15.214
now she won't answer her phone.

12:15.464 --> 12:17.842
She has a history of mental illness.

12:18.384 --> 12:20.261
You gotta help me out.

12:27.101 --> 12:28.769
Look, I can't.

12:29.603 --> 12:30.604
Her W-2,

12:30.646 --> 12:31.814
the address is a PO box.

12:31.856 --> 12:33.357
I'll take whatever I can get.

12:35.609 --> 12:37.611
- Let me see what I got in the office.
- Thank you.

12:37.611 --> 12:38.863
If you find her,

12:38.988 --> 12:40.739
you tell her not to come back.

12:40.865 --> 12:43.826
I don't need some nut case
creating chaos in here.

12:46.370 --> 12:48.038
- Nancy?
- Yes, sir.

12:48.038 --> 12:49.957
- Is Doug back yet?
- In his office.

12:50.207 --> 12:51.292
And, sir?

12:51.667 --> 12:54.378
Birthday cards have started
to arrive. A few presents.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.672
Thank-you notes. Inventory the
presents. Anything valuable...

12:56.714 --> 12:58.382
- Goes in the conference room.
- Anything cheap...

12:58.382 --> 13:00.593
- Goes to the interns.
- You know what to do with the cards.

13:00.634 --> 13:02.261
Yes, sir.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.936
I'm picking her up tonight.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.813
I got everything set up for her in Joppa.

13:12.938 --> 13:14.732
- Where's that?
- Maryland,

13:14.773 --> 13:16.442
about 30 minutes north of Baltimore.

13:16.567 --> 13:17.902
That's close to home.

13:17.902 --> 13:19.153
We want her to disappear,

13:19.195 --> 13:20.571
but not on us.

13:20.696 --> 13:23.032
- Fine. Do you have the burner?
- Yeah.

13:31.999 --> 13:33.751
Happy birthday.

13:34.877 --> 13:37.713
It's pre-paid. All you need
to do is turn it on and dial.

13:37.796 --> 13:39.131
We still have the phone history.

13:39.256 --> 13:41.550
All the more reason to
be safe going forward.

13:41.675 --> 13:44.011
- Where are we with Christina?
- I'm on it.

13:44.053 --> 13:45.262
Linda's office.

13:45.387 --> 13:47.222
I called her this morning.

13:51.602 --> 13:53.312
Are you Gillian Cole?

13:53.354 --> 13:56.148
Yeah. Have we met?

13:56.732 --> 13:58.859
No, we haven't met. You know my husband.

13:58.901 --> 14:01.445
- Your husband?
- David Applebaum.

14:03.489 --> 14:06.325
- So it's true.
- It was a mistake.

14:06.784 --> 14:08.327
You wanna see our kids?

14:08.410 --> 14:09.787
I can show you pictures.

14:09.912 --> 14:12.373
- Mrs. Applebaum...
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

14:12.414 --> 14:13.457
I'm sorry.

14:13.582 --> 14:15.668
You're sorry? I don't think you're sorry.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.211
And don't think for a second

14:17.252 --> 14:19.088
you're gonna use that baby
to get money out of us.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.924
- He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.
- But you knew he was married.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.634
How could you?

14:23.759 --> 14:25.427
- Did he talk about us?
- No.

14:25.427 --> 14:26.762
Lying bitch.

14:26.887 --> 14:28.681
Am I embarrassing you?

14:28.681 --> 14:30.474
Did you think about how you would...

14:30.516 --> 14:32.726
humiliate me and my kids?

14:33.519 --> 14:34.561
Use a condom

14:34.561 --> 14:36.855
the next time you fuck somebody's husband.

15:03.841 --> 15:05.718
It's been less than 24 hours.

15:05.759 --> 15:07.678
She quits her job in the middle of a shift?

15:07.719 --> 15:09.721
She's scared. I'd take off too.

15:09.763 --> 15:10.973
It's Underwood.

15:11.014 --> 15:12.891
He's moving faster than we are.

15:12.933 --> 15:14.184
What about the stripper?

15:14.226 --> 15:16.019
Refuses to talk.

15:16.019 --> 15:17.229
Kapeniak?

15:17.271 --> 15:19.690
No current address.
No siblings. Parents are dead.

15:20.107 --> 15:21.775
Rachel's the last loose end.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.318
She must know something else

15:23.360 --> 15:24.820
bigger than the DUI.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.780
Any idea where she went?

15:26.905 --> 15:28.615
I got a PO box in Dupont.

15:28.615 --> 15:29.992
But none of the clerks have seen her.

15:30.033 --> 15:31.618
I could go stake it out, but...

15:31.743 --> 15:33.620
Have you talked to your guy yet?

15:33.620 --> 15:34.788
The next day or two.

15:34.913 --> 15:37.624
He's bringing me the police
report on Russo's suicide.

15:37.666 --> 15:38.876
I'll press him for more.

15:38.876 --> 15:40.252
And what's your next move?

15:40.502 --> 15:42.796
Trying to figure out
how to respond to this.

15:45.007 --> 15:46.842
I got it a couple hours ago.

15:48.218 --> 15:49.803
I think he's setting her up.

15:49.928 --> 15:51.680
I know how to handle him.

15:51.805 --> 15:54.183
- The less he knows, the better.
- We might learn something.

15:54.224 --> 15:55.392
Not with him calling the shots.

15:55.434 --> 15:56.768
I'm choosing the place.

15:56.768 --> 15:58.854
- As if that makes a difference.
- I'm not gonna fuck him,

15:58.854 --> 16:00.439
just talk to him.

16:05.611 --> 16:07.613
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

16:09.031 --> 16:10.532
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
- That's ok.

16:10.574 --> 16:11.992
No, it's not.

16:12.534 --> 16:15.287
- I just don't want you to be careless.
- I won't be.

16:16.121 --> 16:17.706
You want no life?

16:18.790 --> 16:23.045
You want more work than
three people can handle?

16:23.086 --> 16:26.465
You want a decent chance that you
could be fired within the first month?

16:27.007 --> 16:28.675
If that tempts you,

16:29.009 --> 16:31.511
- we can keep talking.
- None of that intimidates me.

16:31.595 --> 16:33.347
I've been running a congressional district

16:33.388 --> 16:34.431
for the past nine weeks

16:34.514 --> 16:36.058
with zero assistance.

16:36.183 --> 16:38.727
Nobody elected me. Nobody taught me.

16:38.769 --> 16:40.896
I've done it because somebody had to.

16:40.896 --> 16:43.357
What happened was tragic, but

16:43.398 --> 16:45.108
you won't get sympathy from me.

16:45.150 --> 16:46.568
I don't have time for it.

16:46.693 --> 16:48.028
I wouldn't be sitting here

16:48.070 --> 16:50.113
if I wanted a shoulder to cry on.

16:55.994 --> 16:57.454
Rachel?

17:13.011 --> 17:14.512
Leave.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.984
I said leave.

17:29.778 --> 17:32.489
- Are you packed?
- I'm not going anywhere.

17:34.074 --> 17:35.701
So you didn't quit today.

17:36.410 --> 17:38.328
I did, but I changed my mind.

17:39.371 --> 17:41.164
This isn't your decision to make.

17:41.456 --> 17:42.791
I'm keeping my job

17:42.916 --> 17:44.501
and I'm keeping this apartment.

17:44.626 --> 17:46.211
No, you're not.

17:47.170 --> 17:50.090
- You promised you'd make this go away.
- And you're starting over...

17:50.132 --> 17:52.718
I already started over. I
don't want to start over again.

17:53.969 --> 17:55.512
I wish you didn't have to.

17:57.139 --> 17:58.557
Get out.

18:00.183 --> 18:01.476
Get out!

18:01.476 --> 18:03.145
Lower your voice.

18:05.772 --> 18:07.399
I'll fucking kill you.

18:07.774 --> 18:09.359
Go ahead.

18:18.452 --> 18:21.788
I am the only one who can
protect you. Don't you see that?

18:23.415 --> 18:25.834
You have no idea how much danger you're in.

18:42.142 --> 18:43.393
Hey.

18:44.519 --> 18:45.896
Start packing.

18:55.822 --> 18:57.657
You know I ask every year.

18:57.699 --> 18:59.493
Nothing, as usual.

19:02.204 --> 19:03.580
I thought we could have dinner.

19:03.580 --> 19:05.832
Only if it's someplace where
nobody will recognize us.

19:05.832 --> 19:07.876
- I don't want anyone...
- I mean at home.

19:07.918 --> 19:09.252
I'll cook something.

19:10.378 --> 19:11.671
No cake.

19:11.713 --> 19:13.089
- No cake.
- No gifts.

19:13.131 --> 19:14.424
No gifts.

19:14.549 --> 19:15.884
I could do that.

19:15.884 --> 19:17.344
How's the lawsuit coming?

19:17.385 --> 19:18.803
We'll be fine.

19:19.387 --> 19:21.514
We'd like to increase
the size of your detail

19:21.556 --> 19:23.934
to full head-of-state
status starting tomorrow.

19:23.975 --> 19:26.228
Well, that won't be happening.

19:26.561 --> 19:27.812
It's good to get a head start,

19:27.812 --> 19:30.148
- so by the time the announcement...
- If these are my last few days

19:30.190 --> 19:31.858
before I never have privacy again.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.527
I intend to savor these
moments for as long as I can.

19:34.569 --> 19:35.904
But, sir, in terms of safety...

19:35.904 --> 19:37.781
Until I'm confirmed as vice president,

19:37.822 --> 19:40.075
security is at my
discretion, is that correct?

19:40.200 --> 19:42.535
- Technically, yes, but...
- Then that's settled.

19:42.869 --> 19:44.955
All right, we'll wait
until the announcement.

19:45.288 --> 19:47.123
Now, assuming the
confirmation goes through,

19:47.165 --> 19:49.209
we'll need to work out
the logistics of moving you

19:49.251 --> 19:50.794
into the Naval Observatory.

19:50.835 --> 19:52.379
That won't be happening either.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.756
The congressman will be
remaining in his town house.

19:54.798 --> 19:57.842
But it doesn't have the
necessary security infrastructure.

20:00.595 --> 20:02.180
Then you'll need to build it.

20:02.597 --> 20:04.349
We're talking blast-proofing,

20:04.391 --> 20:06.226
hard-wired communications networks,

20:06.268 --> 20:09.354
- 24-hour office space...
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

20:09.813 --> 20:12.691
I'll contact you directly
about setting a plan in motion.

20:18.613 --> 20:20.532
Oh, and one last thing before you go.

20:20.573 --> 20:23.576
I'd like to have Edward
Meechum serve on my detail.

20:23.618 --> 20:24.953
He's Capitol Police.

20:24.995 --> 20:27.247
For now. You're about to appoint
him to the Secret Service.

20:27.247 --> 20:29.582
That would require an
accelerated training program.

20:29.624 --> 20:31.501
Sir, we have plenty of qualified agents,

20:31.543 --> 20:33.169
men and women with years of experience.

20:33.211 --> 20:34.629
And I look forward to
working with all of them

20:34.671 --> 20:36.673
as long as Edward Meechum is on the detail.

20:36.673 --> 20:38.425
Thank you very much for your time.

20:38.508 --> 20:40.051
Thank you, sir.

20:53.023 --> 20:55.525
Nancy, have Meechum bring the car around.

21:08.121 --> 21:10.248
You know, last time was the last time.

21:10.248 --> 21:12.500
I know, but this is important.

21:12.751 --> 21:15.754
You keep selling me that
swampland. I'm done buying.

21:16.671 --> 21:17.881
No more.

21:17.964 --> 21:18.590
The cover-up.

21:18.631 --> 21:20.300
You said it went as high as Barney Hull.

21:20.341 --> 21:21.426
That's not what I said.

21:21.468 --> 21:23.511
- When you gave me Rachel Posner's arrest file...
- What I said

21:23.553 --> 21:26.431
is that arrests don't disappear
without a big-ass wand.

21:26.473 --> 21:27.932
That ain't the same as proof.

21:27.974 --> 21:29.809
We think congressional
leadership took part.

21:29.851 --> 21:31.728
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do. I know you do.

21:31.770 --> 21:33.313
No, I really don't.

21:33.313 --> 21:34.689
When you helped me expose the drug ring...

21:34.731 --> 21:35.648
They were dirty street cops

21:35.648 --> 21:38.234
stuffing a few grams in their
pockets. This is different.

21:38.234 --> 21:40.862
- Powerful fucking people.
- Dirty cops are dirty cops.

21:40.904 --> 21:42.572
- You want to protect them?
- I have a pension

21:42.614 --> 21:44.157
- and a family.
- I understand, but...

21:44.199 --> 21:45.533
Don't contact me again.

22:38.127 --> 22:40.338
- Where's your cell?
- Here.

22:40.380 --> 22:41.965
It's not recording.

22:42.090 --> 22:45.301
I need to ask you to delete
all of our phone history.

22:45.343 --> 22:46.511
Why would I do that?

22:46.552 --> 22:48.263
I'm trying to protect both you and I.

22:48.263 --> 22:50.223
I'm not facing prison.

22:52.267 --> 22:54.811
You didn't cover up the arrest?

22:55.561 --> 22:57.981
Was it because you
wanted him to be governor?

22:58.106 --> 23:01.025
No. He was in trouble so I helped.

23:01.067 --> 23:02.986
And later he expressed a desire to run

23:02.986 --> 23:05.238
- and I offered guidance.
- To an alcoholic?

23:05.363 --> 23:07.782
To a sober, recovering alcoholic.

23:07.824 --> 23:10.410
Did you want him to self-sabotage?

23:10.410 --> 23:11.911
Absolutely not.

23:12.036 --> 23:14.247
It got Matthews in the race.

23:14.372 --> 23:17.500
I like to back people who want to succeed.

23:17.542 --> 23:19.294
Take yourself as an example.

23:19.335 --> 23:21.212
You just took advantage of the situation.

23:21.254 --> 23:24.465
Matthews took advantage. I
didn't seek the nomination.

23:25.633 --> 23:28.720
Russo was in the passenger
seat when he died.

23:31.764 --> 23:34.142
That's not entirely accurate.

23:34.392 --> 23:35.977
I saw the police report.

23:36.019 --> 23:38.062
And I spoke to the commissioner directly

23:38.062 --> 23:39.480
because I cared about Peter

23:39.480 --> 23:41.941
and I wanted to know the full story.

23:42.066 --> 23:44.152
He wasn't in the passenger seat?

23:47.697 --> 23:50.283
The passenger door was
open and he was halfway out.

23:50.283 --> 23:51.951
They think that...

23:53.202 --> 23:55.496
he might have had second thoughts.

23:56.497 --> 23:59.375
If I speak to Barney
Hull, he'll confirm that?

24:00.501 --> 24:02.628
What are you suggesting, Zoe?

24:02.712 --> 24:04.005
Maybe there was foul play.

24:04.047 --> 24:05.506
If there was a hint of foul play,

24:05.506 --> 24:07.633
don't you think the police
would have investigated?

24:07.675 --> 24:09.594
The same police that buried his DUI?

24:09.594 --> 24:11.971
And you think I was involved?

24:12.638 --> 24:14.557
There's a connection between you.

24:14.599 --> 24:16.392
Listen to you. You sound ludicrous.

24:16.392 --> 24:17.977
I'm just asking questions.

24:17.977 --> 24:20.146
No, you're connecting
dots that don't exist.

24:20.188 --> 24:23.357
You want me to just walk away,
act as if I don't know anything?

24:23.399 --> 24:25.568
Yes, I got Peter out of a jam.

24:25.568 --> 24:27.820
Yes, I sent him to speak to Kapeniak.

24:27.862 --> 24:29.906
But beyond that, there's nothing to know.

24:29.947 --> 24:32.533
Can you blame me if I find it
difficult to trust you right now?

24:32.575 --> 24:33.743
Trust me or not,

24:33.868 --> 24:36.662
but I'm about to be confirmed
as the vice president.

24:36.788 --> 24:40.208
And our relationship extends
to the Oval Office now.

24:40.249 --> 24:43.461
Don't step out of the
sunlight for no reason.

24:44.086 --> 24:47.423
Let's start this new
chapter with a clean slate.

24:49.467 --> 24:53.429
Now, you sleep on that
and I'll be in touch.

25:00.269 --> 25:02.647
<i>We'll start with
blood and hormone tests.</i>

25:02.688 --> 25:04.649
<i>Those results should be
back within a few days.</i>

25:04.649 --> 25:06.776
If they're good, we'll
move onto genetic testing

25:06.818 --> 25:08.277
for both you and your husband.

25:08.319 --> 25:10.112
Have you spoken to him yet?

25:10.154 --> 25:13.115
Not yet. I want to do the tests first.

25:13.157 --> 25:15.201
We can do those anytime this week.

25:15.201 --> 25:17.537
I'll have my office call yours.

25:18.246 --> 25:20.748
Oh, I almost forgot. I've
been doing some research

25:20.790 --> 25:23.125
- on the Internet.
- Be careful of the Internet.

25:24.544 --> 25:25.962
Well, I was looking into

25:25.962 --> 25:28.589
common issues associated
with post-40 pregnancies

25:28.631 --> 25:31.467
and this drug came up, but
there wasn't much on it. It's

25:31.717 --> 25:34.679
- Cruvenae...
- Cruvenae-tenuestrin.

25:34.804 --> 25:36.222
You probably haven't found much

25:36.264 --> 25:38.224
because it's still in the beta stage.

25:38.349 --> 25:39.976
And what does it do?

25:39.976 --> 25:42.853
It helps maximize blood
flow to the placenta.

25:42.979 --> 25:46.691
Until CVT, there hasn't been
any viable drug for that.

25:46.983 --> 25:48.651
The jury's still out.

25:48.776 --> 25:52.446
But placental insufficiency
affects women of all ages.

25:52.488 --> 25:54.532
I wouldn't worry about it for now.

25:54.574 --> 25:57.535
That's putting the cart
way before the horse.

26:02.373 --> 26:04.709
<i>- You know,
- Matthews has this locked up,</i>

26:04.750 --> 26:06.627
<i>but conservatives on the Hill are saying</i>

26:06.669 --> 26:08.296
<i>he's gonna return to Harrisburg</i>

26:08.337 --> 26:11.215
<i>with the same myopic
deficit growing mentality... </i>

26:20.850 --> 26:24.020
<i>As to who's gonna replace
Matthews when he wins... </i>

26:24.145 --> 26:28.065
- Can I at least turn off the overhead?
- Of course.

26:29.817 --> 26:32.194
Do you want me to go work downstairs?

26:32.194 --> 26:35.323
No, that's fine. Just make some room.

26:41.495 --> 26:43.873
You haven't said a word.

26:44.498 --> 26:45.958
No.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.127
Where does that leave us?

26:49.420 --> 26:51.797
I'm fully prepared.

26:52.131 --> 26:55.092
And I have been for some time.

27:03.893 --> 27:07.229
I know you'll do whatever
you think is best.

27:10.858 --> 27:12.526
But Underwood confirmed it.

27:12.526 --> 27:14.361
He's gonna be tapped for VP.

27:14.403 --> 27:15.529
That doesn't get us any closer.

27:15.571 --> 27:17.823
We know that Russo cleared
the way for Matthews.

27:17.823 --> 27:19.825
It reinforces the theory,
it doesn't give us proof.

27:19.867 --> 27:22.203
We can't go after the
guy for playing dirty.

27:22.203 --> 27:24.997
And that's not news. Half the
fuckers in Congress play dirty.

27:24.997 --> 27:27.708
He propped up a sham candidate
just to take him down.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.001
Nobody forced Russo to drink that night.

27:29.043 --> 27:31.420
- The guy was an alcoholic.
- We don't know what happened that night,

27:31.462 --> 27:34.131
other than three days
later, he killed himself.

27:35.132 --> 27:37.551
Are you gonna contact him again?

27:37.843 --> 27:38.886
I don't know.

27:38.928 --> 27:41.263
We need to slow down, take
a step back and reevaluate...

27:41.263 --> 27:42.556
We already let Rachel slip away.

27:42.556 --> 27:44.141
There's no point until we have more.

27:44.183 --> 27:46.811
- We should keep him guessing, not...
- Have more from where? From who?

27:46.852 --> 27:48.813
I don't know. We should exhaust all options

27:48.854 --> 27:51.357
before Zoe reaches back out to
Underwood. It looks desperate.

27:51.398 --> 27:53.818
We are up against a brick
wall. And unless Under...

27:53.818 --> 27:55.611
Zoe.

27:55.861 --> 27:58.364
Hey. Hey.

27:59.198 --> 28:01.325
Hey.

28:01.367 --> 28:03.035
I just need to think.

28:03.077 --> 28:06.205
- Well, let's think about it together.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

28:08.290 --> 28:09.750
Freddy?

28:09.750 --> 28:10.960
Yeah, Frank?

28:11.001 --> 28:12.336
Was there something different

28:12.378 --> 28:14.755
about these ribs this morning?

28:15.339 --> 28:17.341
Better or worse?

28:17.466 --> 28:20.177
I didn't think that they
could get any better,

28:20.219 --> 28:22.930
but these were something special.

28:23.264 --> 28:24.390
Well,

28:25.140 --> 28:27.518
tried a new butcher.

28:27.935 --> 28:29.728
Slow-bleeds his hogs.

28:29.728 --> 28:32.815
- It ain't legal, but...
- Well, I won't tell anyone.

28:32.815 --> 28:35.359
I don't know if I'm gonna go back to him.

28:35.484 --> 28:37.236
Went out to his shop.

28:37.278 --> 28:40.656
He's got a room in the back
where he does it. Soundproof.

28:40.698 --> 28:43.576
- A whole setup.
- Why soundproof?

28:43.867 --> 28:45.995
'Cause of how they scream.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.330
They can smell it comin'.

28:48.455 --> 28:50.833
You stick that pipe in their throat,

28:50.958 --> 28:52.960
next ten minutes is hell.

28:53.085 --> 28:54.420
Bust your fucking eardrums.

28:54.461 --> 28:58.090
Now, the humane way to
do it is to make it quick.

28:58.674 --> 29:01.635
Bring out a bucket of slop
like it's feeding time,

29:01.677 --> 29:06.473
then bam, shovel right
to the base of the head.

29:06.724 --> 29:08.601
No screamin'.

29:09.852 --> 29:13.856
Now, he's willing to open up the
race, but Birch was very clear:

29:13.897 --> 29:15.649
if he can't endorse
anyone, you can't either.

29:15.691 --> 29:17.026
That's fair.

29:17.067 --> 29:18.611
You really want Buchwalter to win?

29:18.652 --> 29:21.572
I want the best man to win.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.450
That sounds like a cagey,
bullshit non-answer to me.

29:24.450 --> 29:27.244
I'm on the sidelines for this one, Terry.

29:27.536 --> 29:29.997
You're never on the sidelines, Frank.

29:30.372 --> 29:33.292
I'll see you around.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.437
Claire,

29:53.479 --> 29:55.981
you wouldn't return my calls.

29:56.273 --> 29:57.775
I'll be back.

29:58.233 --> 30:02.404
My attorney said that I
shouldn't be in contact with you.

30:03.113 --> 30:05.824
Blue Cross said my insurance was canceled.

30:05.949 --> 30:07.743
Oh?

30:08.494 --> 30:10.746
The severance package

30:10.746 --> 30:13.415
gave me health coverage for up to a year.

30:13.999 --> 30:16.335
That sounds right.

30:16.627 --> 30:19.254
So there must be some kind of mistake.

30:19.546 --> 30:22.299
Well, you'll have to talk
to the insurance company.

30:22.299 --> 30:24.760
I did. They said it was terminated.

30:24.802 --> 30:27.054
They can't reinstate it
without the employer's approval.

30:27.096 --> 30:29.264
And you want me to get involved?

30:30.015 --> 30:32.309
There's medication that I need

30:32.434 --> 30:35.187
that I can't get unless
it goes through my HMO.

30:35.312 --> 30:36.563
Oh, I'm well aware.

30:36.605 --> 30:38.899
I reviewed your records.

30:39.399 --> 30:41.568
- What?
- You signed a consent form.

30:41.693 --> 30:43.737
No, I didn't.

30:49.159 --> 30:50.536
You forged my signature?

30:50.577 --> 30:53.288
Did a Mrs. Applebaum pay you a visit?

30:56.792 --> 30:58.168
You realize

30:58.168 --> 31:00.587
- what you're doing is...
- Civil,

31:00.712 --> 31:02.673
- not criminal.
- Have you thought this out?

31:02.714 --> 31:05.175
- Because when we go to court...
- You mean six months from now?

31:05.217 --> 31:07.553
You're expecting in four, no?

31:07.678 --> 31:10.264
That's four months without
the medicine you need.

31:13.976 --> 31:15.602
I'm willing to let your child

31:15.602 --> 31:18.522
wither and die inside you
if that's what's required.

31:18.647 --> 31:20.899
But neither of us wants that.

31:22.317 --> 31:25.946
Now tell me, am I really the
sort of enemy you want to make?

31:26.947 --> 31:29.533
But here's the alternative:

31:30.868 --> 31:33.203
this office, this staff,

31:35.956 --> 31:38.125
The CWI could be yours,

31:38.166 --> 31:41.044
and you and me, we wash
our hands of each other.

31:41.545 --> 31:43.338
- You're trying to buy me.
- No.

31:43.380 --> 31:45.883
When we first met, I
promised to empower you.

31:46.008 --> 31:47.384
I'm fulfilling that promise.

31:47.426 --> 31:49.636
- How do I get screwed?
- You don't. I resign.

31:49.678 --> 31:51.680
You take my place.

31:52.890 --> 31:55.142
- No strings?
- None.

31:55.434 --> 31:57.978
<i>Exit polls have
Jim Matthews winning by anywhere... </i>

31:57.978 --> 31:59.897
<i>from a nine to 12
percent margin of victory.</i>

31:59.897 --> 32:02.065
<i>- Swofford is expected to make...
- Hello?</i>

32:02.107 --> 32:03.984
<i>- Mrs. Underwood?
- Yes?</i>

32:03.984 --> 32:06.361
<i>Hi, I'm calling from Dr. Larson's office</i>

32:06.403 --> 32:07.863
<i>to confirm your 10 a.m. tomorrow</i>

32:07.904 --> 32:10.240
<i>for the blood and urine tests.</i>

32:12.868 --> 32:14.745
I can't come.

32:14.870 --> 32:16.872
<i>Well, if tomorrow doesn't work,</i>

32:16.955 --> 32:18.165
<i>we can reschedule for Thursday,</i>

32:18.206 --> 32:21.585
<i>- or even Monday.
- No, I won't be rescheduling.</i>

32:21.627 --> 32:24.796
Please tell Dr. Larson I
appreciate all her consultation,

32:24.838 --> 32:27.674
but I've put a great
deal of thought into this

32:27.716 --> 32:30.552
and I won't be pursuing any further tests.

32:30.594 --> 32:32.512
Thank you.

34:05.105 --> 34:07.691
Have you thought
about what we discussed?

34:07.983 --> 34:11.235
I think you're right. We
should start with a clean state.

34:12.279 --> 34:14.739
What about our text messages?

34:23.581 --> 34:25.667
And the contact.

34:33.049 --> 34:35.802
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

34:35.802 --> 34:38.054
We can put all this
other nonsense behind us

34:38.096 --> 34:40.974
and trust one another and
continue to help one another?

34:41.016 --> 34:43.310
I'd like that.

34:43.601 --> 34:45.603
Then consider the slate clean.

34:45.728 --> 34:47.731
Answer me one thing.

34:47.856 --> 34:49.399
The passenger seat?

34:49.524 --> 34:51.359
You said Russo was trying to get out,

34:51.400 --> 34:52.985
but there was nothing abnormal...

34:53.027 --> 34:54.612
- I thought we just agreed...
- I want to believe you,

34:54.654 --> 34:56.031
But I need details,

34:56.031 --> 34:58.033
more than what you're sharing.

34:58.033 --> 34:59.200
What's your question?

34:59.242 --> 35:00.952
The night Russo fell off the wagon,

35:00.994 --> 35:02.621
he was at a fund-raiser,

35:02.662 --> 35:05.916
- the McNeally Cancer Institute.
- All in the police report.

35:08.251 --> 35:11.338
Rachel Posner was at the hotel that night.

35:11.463 --> 35:13.465
Who's that?

35:13.506 --> 35:15.842
The call girl who was with
Russo when he was arrested.

35:15.884 --> 35:17.928
I didn't know her name.

35:18.720 --> 35:21.056
She disappeared, Francis.

35:21.723 --> 35:23.016
When?

35:23.058 --> 35:24.601
Don't act surprised.

35:24.643 --> 35:26.478
I showed the bellmen a photo.

35:26.603 --> 35:28.647
One of them remembers seeing her.

35:28.772 --> 35:32.233
The girl's a prostitute. I'm
sure she frequents many hotels.

35:32.359 --> 35:34.653
But that hotel on that night?

35:34.694 --> 35:37.656
Well, now you sound
like Ms. Skorsky talking.

35:38.365 --> 35:40.575
I haven't discussed this with anyone.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.369
I wanted to ask you first.

35:42.494 --> 35:44.704
I have no idea what happened that night

35:44.704 --> 35:46.706
except that Peter started drinking again.

35:46.748 --> 35:50.126
I don't know who was or
wasn't there. I wish I was.

35:50.168 --> 35:51.795
Maybe I could've stopped him.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.922
Do you know where Rachel is?

35:53.963 --> 35:57.425
- Listen to what I am saying.
- I'm trying to protect us both.

35:57.634 --> 35:59.219
These are questions anyone could ask.

35:59.219 --> 36:01.763
But no one is except you.

36:01.888 --> 36:04.265
I can't imagine what you're after.

36:04.307 --> 36:06.351
I took a chance,

36:06.393 --> 36:09.896
showed up at your house and
placed myself at your feet.

36:10.021 --> 36:11.940
Crossed ethical lines,

36:11.981 --> 36:14.901
professionally, physically,

36:15.402 --> 36:17.946
and I hold myself accountable for that.

36:18.154 --> 36:20.615
Those were my choices
and I can live with them.

36:22.117 --> 36:23.493
I'd like to move forward,

36:23.535 --> 36:26.955
but I need to know exactly
what I was a part of, that...

36:28.415 --> 36:30.750
that I wasn't a part of someone's...

36:33.169 --> 36:35.797
Finish your thought.

36:37.882 --> 36:40.343
A part of someone's murder.

36:40.468 --> 36:41.719
Jesus.

36:43.096 --> 36:44.806
I wanna believe you, Francis.

39:29.345 --> 39:30.972
Damn.

39:31.097 --> 39:32.890
- Come in.
- I've been calling you.

39:34.267 --> 39:36.644
Come here.

39:40.189 --> 39:43.860
Come in. Sit down. Um...

39:43.985 --> 39:49.824
You want something? Some water or... juice?

39:55.663 --> 39:57.707
You going somewhere?

39:58.749 --> 40:00.585
Hey. You going somewhere?

40:00.585 --> 40:03.004
To my mom's. In Ithaca.

40:03.796 --> 40:05.923
- What?
- I'm leaving.

40:05.923 --> 40:09.177
No, no. No, no, no. No. No way.

40:09.302 --> 40:11.512
- We have nothing.
- Are you giving up on this?

40:11.637 --> 40:13.556
There are only three people in the world

40:13.556 --> 40:15.933
that know what he has done,
and one of them is gone.

40:16.058 --> 40:17.185
If we had anything,

40:17.226 --> 40:19.103
Lucas, any hard evidence,

40:19.145 --> 40:20.646
or even a fucking quote

40:20.646 --> 40:22.440
from a source that would
go on record for us,

40:22.440 --> 40:23.608
that would be one thing,

40:23.608 --> 40:24.942
but we're grasping,

40:24.942 --> 40:26.694
and he is not fucking around.

40:26.819 --> 40:30.031
You were the one who
told Zoe to pursue this.

40:30.156 --> 40:31.407
She told me what you said:

40:31.407 --> 40:34.368
"The only stories that mattered were
the ones that scared you to death."

40:34.410 --> 40:36.370
Ok, this isn't just death threats!

40:36.495 --> 40:37.914
This is real!

40:38.206 --> 40:40.917
He doesn't know about
you, but he knows about me.

40:41.042 --> 40:42.668
These were in my mailbox.

40:42.710 --> 40:44.629
No return address.

40:44.670 --> 40:46.756
- He took these of her?
- Who else?

40:46.881 --> 40:48.299
You can keep them,

40:48.341 --> 40:50.176
- but I don't think they're gonna help you.
- We need to stop him.

40:50.218 --> 40:52.303
Sick fucking shit.

40:52.428 --> 40:56.182
Janine, you cannot run away from this.

40:56.224 --> 40:57.975
My entire career,

40:58.017 --> 41:00.978
I have always chosen the tough stories.

41:01.103 --> 41:03.022
I have been fearless.

41:04.023 --> 41:05.983
But you know what?

41:06.108 --> 41:09.195
I'm really fucking scared this time.

41:09.528 --> 41:11.072
He's got power,

41:11.113 --> 41:12.531
he's got a lot to lose,

41:12.573 --> 41:14.575
- and right now he is winning.
- Please, I need your help, please...

41:14.617 --> 41:17.578
Just wake the fuck up, Lucas!

41:35.638 --> 41:38.766
<i>The incident occurred

<i>Previously, she worked
at the Washington Herald</i>

41:50.861 --> 41:53.906
<i>as a metro reporter and
political correspondent.</i>

41:53.990 --> 41:56.117
<i>Barnes broke several major stories,</i>

41:56.158 --> 41:59.912
<i>including an early draft of the
Education Reform and Achievement Act</i>

41:59.954 --> 42:01.831
<i>as well as a college newspaper article</i>

42:01.872 --> 42:03.958
<i>that derailed Senator Michael Kerns'</i>

42:04.000 --> 42:06.002
<i>nomination for Secretary of State.</i>

42:27.398 --> 42:29.859
What did you think of the files?

42:29.984 --> 42:32.862
- There's plenty to work with.
- Did you look at your own?

42:32.862 --> 42:35.072
There was nothing there.

42:36.323 --> 42:39.577
- Should there be?
- No.

42:40.077 --> 42:41.328
Even if you're lying,

42:41.370 --> 42:43.164
the fact I haven't been
able to find anything

42:43.205 --> 42:45.207
tells me you're very good
at covering your tracks.

42:45.249 --> 42:47.042
That's valuable to me.

42:47.084 --> 42:48.461
Here's our battleground.

42:48.461 --> 42:50.504
One hundred and 13 votes.

42:50.755 --> 42:52.882
You have the skeletons.

42:55.551 --> 42:57.386
If I lose,

42:57.511 --> 43:00.723
- they'll come after me.
- That's a risk you'll have to take.

43:01.682 --> 43:04.059
How do I know you're not just using me?

43:04.101 --> 43:06.103
Throwing a wrench into someone else's bid?

43:06.145 --> 43:07.605
That's another risk.

43:07.605 --> 43:10.691
The alternative is you wait ten years.

43:10.816 --> 43:12.610
You chose me for a reason.

43:13.402 --> 43:15.696
I'd like to know what it is.

43:16.197 --> 43:18.491
All right.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.619
How many missile strikes did you launch?

43:21.619 --> 43:24.455
- But you did it anyway.
- Enough to keep me awake at night.

43:24.497 --> 43:25.414
Yes, I did.

43:25.456 --> 43:27.833
- How many women and children?
- Too many.

43:27.958 --> 43:29.668
And you launched those missiles knowing

43:29.668 --> 43:31.003
all those innocent people would die.

43:31.045 --> 43:33.088
I had orders to eliminate the enemy.

43:33.130 --> 43:35.925
Which you carried out
expertly and efficiently.

43:36.842 --> 43:38.761
Have you ever killed anyone?

43:39.845 --> 43:41.180
No.

43:41.222 --> 43:44.975
I watched. Apartment buildings,
entire villages... gone,

43:45.017 --> 43:46.810
like they were never there.

43:47.186 --> 43:49.897
I'd prefer not to talk about
it, if that's all right.

43:50.356 --> 43:55.444
You did what needed to be done
and that's why I chose you, Jackie.

43:56.195 --> 43:58.030
Service background,

43:58.072 --> 43:59.573
clean history,

43:59.615 --> 44:01.909
photogenic. The whole package.

44:02.034 --> 44:04.620
But more importantly...

44:06.497 --> 44:08.874
ruthless pragmatism.

44:08.999 --> 44:11.710
Are we working together or not?

44:13.420 --> 44:16.215
Any public or private
endorsements for Buchwalter,

44:16.215 --> 44:17.174
I come out for Webb.

44:17.174 --> 44:19.301
I'll stay out of the
fray. I give you my word.

44:19.301 --> 44:20.511
Same goes for you, Terry.

44:20.552 --> 44:22.054
All right.

44:26.308 --> 44:28.477
Thank you, Christina.

44:30.646 --> 44:32.815
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. President,

44:32.856 --> 44:35.109
how was Pennsylvania?

44:57.715 --> 44:59.675
You like Indian?

45:20.446 --> 45:22.740
Sir? I've seen the news.

45:24.658 --> 45:26.869
I know she was close to you.

45:29.246 --> 45:31.749
Terrible tragedy.

45:32.583 --> 45:35.252
I spoke to Special Agent
Rockland today, sir.

45:35.544 --> 45:37.463
I begin my training next week.

45:37.713 --> 45:39.590
Very good.

45:44.595 --> 45:46.263
I know it's a day late.

45:46.263 --> 45:48.098
Hope it isn't inappropriate,

45:48.140 --> 45:50.684
but I wanted to give you this.

45:54.605 --> 45:56.440
Thank you, Meechum.

46:06.283 --> 46:07.785
That was very nice of Edward.

46:07.910 --> 46:10.788
He shouldn't have spent
this sort of money on me.

46:10.996 --> 46:12.706
I've opened some wine downstairs.

46:12.748 --> 46:14.833
I'll be down in a minute.

46:18.462 --> 46:21.340
Did you think I'd forgotten you?

46:22.007 --> 46:24.134
Perhaps you hoped I had.

46:24.259 --> 46:27.012
Don't waste a breath mourning Ms. Barnes.

46:27.012 --> 46:29.264
Every kitten grows up to be a cat.

46:29.306 --> 46:31.266
They seem so harmless at first,

46:31.266 --> 46:34.686
small, quiet, lapping
up their saucer of milk.

46:34.811 --> 46:36.980
But once their claws get long enough,

46:37.022 --> 46:38.774
they draw blood,

46:38.899 --> 46:41.485
sometimes from the hand that feeds them.

46:41.610 --> 46:44.613
For those of us climbing to
the top of the food chain,

46:44.613 --> 46:46.573
there can be no mercy.

46:46.615 --> 46:48.534
There is but one rule:

46:48.534 --> 46:52.037
hunt or be hunted.

46:53.413 --> 46:55.582
Welcome back.
