00:00.287 --> 00:01.793
Previously on  Game of Silence...

00:02.073 --> 00:03.537
I told you not to kick this rock.

00:03.570 --> 00:06.174
Take another step,
and this life you built,

00:06.207 --> 00:08.108
- it's torched.
- Get out of my office.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.410
The plan's back on.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.678
I say we take the warden down,

00:10.710 --> 00:12.213
every son of a bitch that hurt us.

00:14.114 --> 00:14.848
All in.

00:14.882 --> 00:15.916
All in.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.652
So, is your new man someone
from Darryl's gang?

00:18.686 --> 00:20.555
- Who is he?
- His name's Marco.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.421
Oh, please...

00:21.454 --> 00:23.825
Drop it, Terry. Now.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.194
This wasn't our deal.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.428
I can't watch you kill.

00:27.462 --> 00:30.297
As long as you want your
brother protected in prison,

00:30.331 --> 00:32.366
you will do whatever I ask.

00:32.399 --> 00:34.335
You need to forget about Red Tyson.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.636
'Cause I killed him.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.640
I shot him and I buried him;
 you won't find him.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.809
I want in. If you guys are
moving forward with this plan

00:41.841 --> 00:43.878
and putting yourselves at risk,
then I want to help.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.746
It's not your fight, baby;
I don't want you involved.

00:45.778 --> 00:47.881
Excuse me, ma'am? Can I help you?

00:47.915 --> 00:50.717
I'd like to volunteer
for Mr. Carroll's campaign.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.422
I canÂ´t just make sure that these
numbers are still valid.

00:54.454 --> 00:55.422
- Okay.
- Thanks.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.224
Hey. What's all this?

00:57.257 --> 01:00.627
This isHolden v.
 Stockman Semiconductor,

01:00.661 --> 01:03.196
also known as the last
36 hours of my life.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.697
Ah, that explains the late nights.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.568
Sleep is for associates, right?

01:08.601 --> 01:11.139
It's a wrongful termination
case for a new client.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.640
They fired their lawyers midstream.

01:12.672 --> 01:13.907
They want us to take over.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.576
That's why Aaron called
the meet and greet?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.911
We're trying to make an impression.

01:16.943 --> 01:19.146
I wanted some partner-sized wattage.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.714
This could be huge business.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.184
So smile pretty
and say smart stuff, okay?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.586
I'll do my best.

01:26.619 --> 01:27.922
Here we go.

01:27.955 --> 01:28.890
Diana, these are my partners,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.790
Marina Nagle and Jackson Brooks.

01:30.824 --> 01:31.792
- Good morning.
- Hello.

01:31.824 --> 01:32.793
Pleasure.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.162
Hello.

01:34.195 --> 01:34.996
Let me tell you about this lady.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.665
Diana is CEO of Stockman Ventures,

01:37.698 --> 01:40.300
third largest company in the Southwest.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.838
Oil, gas, real estate,
technology, they do it all.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.940
She's also chair
of the Petroleum Council,

01:45.972 --> 01:47.941
founder of an autism charity,

01:47.975 --> 01:50.411
and number ten on theForbes list

01:50.443 --> 01:52.213
of top businesswomen in the country.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.881
Did I leave anything out?

01:53.913 --> 01:55.448
I'm also a member of Costco.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.284
And there's that.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.921
Marina, Aaron's told me all about you,

02:00.260 --> 02:02.422
and I just want to make sure
that you're okay with all this.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.233
- I know it's very last-minute.
- Totally up to speed

02:05.266 --> 02:07.595
and ready to go. I just need
to sit with you for a while

02:07.627 --> 02:10.530
before we take the deposition
this afternoon, if that's okay.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.900
Well, I'm all yours.
As long as there's coffee.

02:13.161 --> 02:14.869
Well, it's great meeting you. I have

02:14.901 --> 02:16.603
a site inspection in Beaumont,
so I'm gonna step out.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.538
And leave you in these

02:18.572 --> 02:21.247
- very capable hands.
- All right, then, I'll let you two

02:21.280 --> 02:22.577
- get to it.
- Can you make sure

02:22.609 --> 02:24.366
Ms. Stockman gets her coffee?

02:24.400 --> 02:26.781
Oh, I love it.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.958
Cream and sugar, please, Aaron.

02:28.990 --> 02:30.383
Go on, move along, now.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.887
And you call me Diane.

02:34.862 --> 02:36.181
Okay.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.429
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:42.476 --> 02:43.871
What are you doing?

02:43.904 --> 02:45.233
It's a long ride. I ain't
sitting in the back seat.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.534
Why should I sit in the back seat?

02:46.566 --> 02:48.595
- 'Cause it's your turn.
- Come on! Hey, hey!

02:49.269 --> 02:51.238
Hey, morons, will you just get in?

02:51.271 --> 02:52.707
Shotgun throwdown on three.

02:52.739 --> 02:53.940
- Ready? Come on. Come on.
- No, let's settle...

02:53.973 --> 02:55.409
One, two, three.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.611
He's got rock. Get your ass in the back.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.646
Let's go.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.518
Look, I don't know
what you think I can do.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.520
You'll figure something out.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.834
Witnesses get cold feet all the time.

03:10.516 --> 03:13.997
Dooley's case is already with
the DA. I can't make it go away.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.358
I think you've got
a short-term memory problem.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.604
Your brother's still
doing time in Huntsville.

03:25.264 --> 03:27.775
You don't do for me
and I don't do for him.

03:28.322 --> 03:29.776
Now, I got my lifer to take the fall

03:29.810 --> 03:33.514
for shanking that white boy,
so... now it's your turn.

03:34.158 --> 03:35.983
I want Dooley out of lockup.

03:36.373 --> 03:37.884
If anything happens to Robby...

03:37.917 --> 03:40.587
I've got eyes on him 24-7.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.589
I'm protecting him, for now.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.026
You don't cooperate, well...

03:47.828 --> 03:50.902
...things can go down
pretty fast in that yard.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.238
So, we clear?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.533
Dooley's out.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.040
By tomorrow.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:15.589 --> 04:17.658
Jackie, let me borrow ten dollars.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.392
- Yeah, what for?
- Gift shop.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.961
Buy myself a T-shirt,
a mug or something.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.497
I'd like to see that slogan.

04:23.529 --> 04:24.497
How about

04:24.531 --> 04:25.966
"Quitman Youth Detention Center:

04:25.998 --> 04:28.969
Every Child Left Behind... All of 'em."

04:30.070 --> 04:31.439
Yeah.

04:31.471 --> 04:32.806
Hey, Gil, slow down.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.016
What the hell is all this?

04:42.048 --> 04:43.584
New Quitman...

04:43.617 --> 04:46.120
the private prison industry at work.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.022
What happened to the old one?

04:48.055 --> 04:50.658
Let's go see.

05:42.719 --> 05:46.944
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:47.981 --> 05:51.907
This is crazy. Never thought
I'd be breakinginto this place.

05:58.870 --> 06:00.518
There you have it. Problem solved.

06:01.222 --> 06:02.363
Back in.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.503
I-I shouldn't have brought us back here.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.538
Yeah, maybe this wasn't the best idea.

06:11.570 --> 06:13.506
What? Wait... What? Come on.
We drove all the way out here.

06:14.002 --> 06:15.391
Got to do what we got to do.

06:19.445 --> 06:20.947
It's like Jackie said:

06:20.981 --> 06:22.882
We walk through everything that happened

06:22.916 --> 06:24.318
to Petey, step by step.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.286
You know, we got Bobby's story,
we got Amy's story.

06:26.318 --> 06:27.319
See what fits and what doesn't.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.188
It's the only way
we're gonna figure this out.

06:29.221 --> 06:30.482
Time's wasting.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.309
That's for you, okay? Thanks.

06:50.342 --> 06:51.477
This is so exciting.

06:51.510 --> 06:54.380
I love it when the candidate comes in.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.250
Yeah, I was beginning to wonder.
I've been working here

06:56.282 --> 06:58.184
for, like, a week
and I still haven't met him.

06:58.217 --> 07:01.320
Oh, you'll love him.
Ray Carroll is a wonderful man.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.390
- Hi, how are you?
- Oh, here he comes.

07:04.524 --> 07:08.262
- Hi, how are you?
- Mr. Carroll.

07:08.294 --> 07:10.296
Burt! Looking good.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.006
How you been?

07:11.039 --> 07:11.964
Thank you, everyone,

07:11.998 --> 07:13.332
for all the hard work you're doing.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.113
It really makes a difference.

07:14.145 --> 07:15.199
Thank you.

07:15.645 --> 07:17.686
Hi, Mr. Carroll, I'm Jessie.

07:17.719 --> 07:18.811
Jessie, how you doing?

07:18.844 --> 07:20.640
- I really admire your...
- Martha, this is, uh,

07:20.673 --> 07:22.541
what, third time, right?

07:22.575 --> 07:24.353
- That's right.
- Terrific. Thank you so much.

07:24.387 --> 07:26.146
Keep up the good work, everyone.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.064
Really makes a difference. Thank you.

07:32.681 --> 07:34.180
How you doing, baby brother?

07:35.051 --> 07:36.484
I'm good, I guess.

07:36.951 --> 07:38.499
You put on some weight.

07:38.773 --> 07:39.708
I don't think so.

07:39.828 --> 07:42.254
Yeah. I can see it in your face.

07:43.366 --> 07:44.382
You look healthy.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.724
That's how you want
the parole board to see you.

07:48.998 --> 07:51.751
- And you're clean?
- You ask me that every time.

07:51.776 --> 07:52.974
'Cause it's important.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.142
We need to get you out of here.

07:55.167 --> 07:56.962
I haven't used once.

07:58.138 --> 07:59.741
Been to all my counseling sessions.

07:59.775 --> 08:01.044
I'm straight, sis.

08:01.076 --> 08:02.145
I'm straight.

08:02.657 --> 08:03.835
I know you are.

08:05.213 --> 08:06.468
It's just...

08:06.881 --> 08:08.334
You need to hear it.

08:10.953 --> 08:12.271
How's little Jay?

08:14.157 --> 08:15.424
- He's good.
- Yeah?

08:15.565 --> 08:17.120
Can't wait to see his daddy.

08:20.703 --> 08:23.506
Look at all that hair.

08:24.065 --> 08:25.715
You're going to see him soon.

08:27.192 --> 08:28.593
You got this today, Robby.

08:29.981 --> 08:32.191
You are not the same person
you were when you got here.

08:32.837 --> 08:34.990
You're doing all the right things.

08:35.532 --> 08:38.495
- Be sure you say that, okay?
- Okay.

08:38.897 --> 08:40.164
It's almost over.

08:41.056 --> 08:42.607
For all of us.

08:47.491 --> 08:50.027
This is your attendance record
for the last year.

08:50.547 --> 08:52.936
You missed a number of days of
work. Is that a fair statement?

08:53.350 --> 08:57.488
- A few days, yes.
- 43 days. Is that "a few" to you?

08:57.521 --> 09:00.492
- I had doctor's appointments.
- 43 doctor's appointments?

09:00.525 --> 09:02.474
Obviously they weren't
all doctor's appointments.

09:02.507 --> 09:04.686
So, well over a month of missed work.

09:05.195 --> 09:07.202
And during that time,
with all those absences,

09:07.227 --> 09:08.621
did your sales drop?

09:10.117 --> 09:11.204
It was a slow year.

09:11.237 --> 09:14.294
As director of outside sales
for Stockman Semiconductor,

09:14.327 --> 09:17.104
you fell dramatically short
of your revenue target.

09:17.137 --> 09:19.540
- Isn't that right?
- Object to the characterization.

09:19.565 --> 09:23.140
Well, I'm looking at three
different performance reviews

09:23.165 --> 09:24.770
that say exactly that.

09:24.795 --> 09:28.171
Did your sales
drop by 40% or did they not?

09:28.374 --> 09:29.851
It's a simple question.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.455
Yes.

09:33.937 --> 09:36.587
I wasn't the first pregnant
employee she's fired, you know.

09:36.594 --> 09:37.922
There's a pattern here.

09:37.947 --> 09:40.189
I'm only interested in one
employee, ma'am. That's you.

09:41.621 --> 09:44.083
I was lucky enough to meet my husband,

09:44.108 --> 09:47.008
get married and get pregnant
all within the space of a year.

09:47.358 --> 09:48.982
And that's when everything changed.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.675
Suddenly, I'm out of the loop.

09:51.034 --> 09:52.616
I'm not invited to the client events

09:52.641 --> 09:54.974
with the big boys anymore.
Just frozen out.

09:55.893 --> 09:58.069
She fired me because I got pregnant

09:58.094 --> 09:59.301
and she knows it.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.274
This was personal for her.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.874
She felt betrayed.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.338
Everything was fine until...

10:06.363 --> 10:07.613
You stopped doing your job.

10:09.047 --> 10:09.918
Right?

10:11.129 --> 10:12.238
Diana knows.

10:14.653 --> 10:16.602
I had a boy, by the way.

10:17.542 --> 10:18.606
Mark.

10:22.939 --> 10:25.040
...and what I'm saying
is that immigration

10:25.073 --> 10:27.209
<i>is an economic issue.</i>

10:27.242 --> 10:29.078
What good is it to create jobs

10:29.112 --> 10:31.046
if they go to citizens
of a foreign country?

10:31.079 --> 10:34.049
It makes no sense. So what we have to do

10:34.083 --> 10:35.919
is make sure that our jobs...

10:35.952 --> 10:38.955
That's Mrs. Carroll, right?

10:38.987 --> 10:40.790
Okay, thank you.

10:42.158 --> 10:44.761
And it's about American culture.

10:44.794 --> 10:47.230
It's about preserving American culture,

10:47.262 --> 10:49.298
protecting us from
all the elements out there...

10:49.332 --> 10:50.867
Mrs. Carroll?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.001
You look like you could use this.

10:53.035 --> 10:55.004
Oh, thank you.

10:55.036 --> 10:56.939
And maybe this.

10:56.972 --> 10:58.942
Oh, aren't you an angel.

10:58.974 --> 11:01.407
No telling how many hands
I've shaken this morning.

11:02.011 --> 11:03.440
...we're a strong, powerful...

11:03.472 --> 11:05.219
That is gorgeous suit, by the way.

11:05.407 --> 11:06.586
- Oh.
- St. John's?

11:07.572 --> 11:08.952
It is.

11:09.346 --> 11:10.843
I don't think we've met.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.248
I'm Jessie.

11:12.641 --> 11:14.661
Carol, but everyone calls me CeCe.

11:14.686 --> 11:17.622
Well, it is so nice to finally
meet you, and I can't tell you

11:17.655 --> 11:20.463
how excited I am to be a part
of your husband's campaign.

11:20.496 --> 11:22.981
Well, I'm glad one of us is.

11:23.232 --> 11:25.753
I'll just be happy
when this thing is over.

11:26.035 --> 11:28.978
Sorry. Attitude.

11:29.532 --> 11:32.002
Well, the wives don't get
much credit, do they?

11:33.169 --> 11:34.413
No, they don't.

11:36.412 --> 11:38.614
So what do they have you doing, Jessie?

11:39.080 --> 11:41.246
Oh, I stuff envelopes,
work the phone banks,

11:41.280 --> 11:43.553
stock the fridge, all
that kind of office stuff.

11:43.639 --> 11:44.507
Hmm.

11:44.532 --> 11:46.601
I just wish I could do more, you know?

11:48.024 --> 11:50.548
Are you free this afternoon, sweetie?

11:52.053 --> 11:53.856
Yes, ma'am.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.401
We're doing a little VIP
fund-raiser at the house,

11:56.466 --> 11:58.435
and I think we need to put you

11:58.488 --> 12:00.690
in front of some real live donors.

12:02.837 --> 12:04.739
...America for Americans.

12:32.538 --> 12:33.901
You smell that?

12:34.434 --> 12:35.770
What?

12:35.803 --> 12:37.154
Rubbing alcohol.

12:41.057 --> 12:42.243
Those were the showers

12:42.275 --> 12:45.746
Nurse Amy was talking about
where they rinsed Petey off.

12:45.780 --> 12:46.683
Yeah.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.561
Poor kid. I can't even imagine.

13:00.828 --> 13:02.043
You okay?

13:04.998 --> 13:06.923
Spent a lot of time in this room.

13:08.781 --> 13:10.179
Saw some awful stuff.

13:12.673 --> 13:16.143
What's weird,
it's the only place I felt safe...

13:17.844 --> 13:19.343
...'cause of Nurse Amy.

13:22.016 --> 13:24.306
I thought they gave you gloves
after what happened to Petey.

13:24.705 --> 13:27.108
- Ow!
- Sorry. There you go.

13:27.288 --> 13:29.123
Nice and snug.

13:29.736 --> 13:31.306
Swallow these down, okay?

13:31.339 --> 13:33.312
This is for the pain, and
this'll help you sleep.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.748
Okay.

13:39.633 --> 13:40.601
How's he doing?

13:41.041 --> 13:42.996
- He'll be okay.
- Good.

13:43.838 --> 13:45.900
I'm gonna need him
on stump detail tomorrow,

13:45.933 --> 13:48.506
- so...
- Warden, No. This one's done.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.185
Just leave him be.

13:58.619 --> 14:03.424
Listen, if you ever need a
safe place, you come see me.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.493
I'll always be here for you.

14:15.144 --> 14:16.762
This'll be our little secret.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.864
Don't ever say where you got these.

14:25.113 --> 14:27.176
You know, those pills saved my life.

14:28.048 --> 14:30.588
I used to trade 'em whenever
I got into a tight spot.

14:30.964 --> 14:32.566
Yeah, I remember those pills, too.

14:32.591 --> 14:33.631
You used to hook me up with 'em.

14:34.355 --> 14:36.739
Well, you needed 'em more
than I did, bro.

14:37.084 --> 14:37.987
Mm...

14:41.061 --> 14:42.004
What?

14:43.266 --> 14:46.200
Amy said they brought Petey
in here to rinse him off.

14:46.234 --> 14:48.203
Then Bobby pulled the van up outside.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.225
That's... that's right here.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.168
Look at this.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.756
Nurse Amy said that she stepped out,

14:59.114 --> 15:02.117
they loaded Petey in, but they
wouldn't let her in the van.

15:02.149 --> 15:03.985
That's when Bobby took off.

15:04.018 --> 15:05.553
It's best you stay here.

15:05.586 --> 15:07.221
What?

15:07.254 --> 15:09.657
Petey. No. Petey. Petey.

15:11.893 --> 15:14.399
- So?
- So check it out.

15:15.008 --> 15:17.611
The van leaves through
the sally port, which Amy saw,

15:17.636 --> 15:18.830
but then, according to Bobby,

15:18.855 --> 15:20.857
the van stopped right outside the gate,

15:21.103 --> 15:22.271
and the warden climbed in.

15:26.082 --> 15:28.571
Amy's standing right here.
She must have seen it all.

15:29.084 --> 15:30.745
What's your point?

15:30.778 --> 15:32.703
My point is, she's lying to us, Shawnie.

15:33.175 --> 15:33.971
No way.

15:35.058 --> 15:37.109
- Why would she do that?
- To protect the warden.

15:37.379 --> 15:39.414
She hates the man! You saw her.

15:39.728 --> 15:41.364
If anything,

15:41.397 --> 15:43.343
she's afraid. The man's got her scared.

15:43.368 --> 15:44.730
I know she's your friend,

15:44.755 --> 15:47.003
but that is too important
a detail to leave out.

15:47.028 --> 15:50.307
She didn't tell us that
she saw the warden on purpose.

15:50.972 --> 15:53.343
She's probably still working for him.

15:54.436 --> 15:56.072
Just like Bobby was.

16:00.631 --> 16:04.364
I've worked hard to take
responsibility for my actions.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.551
To be a better man
and an example to my son.

16:08.584 --> 16:10.411
I don't just want to pick up

16:10.444 --> 16:12.705
where I left off when I'm released.

16:12.924 --> 16:16.012
I'm gonna go move in
with my sister and get a job.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.796
She's been helping me out,

16:18.830 --> 16:21.041
taking care of my baby boy. Look, sir,

16:21.599 --> 16:24.003
I'm ready. Promise.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.872
Mr. Winters, I have
a report here stating

16:26.906 --> 16:29.014
that one-point-two ounces of
crack cocaine was found stuffed

16:29.048 --> 16:31.215
inside your mattress during
cell check this morning.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.775
What?! No. No.

16:32.969 --> 16:34.372
- No way!
- Obviously, possession

16:34.397 --> 16:35.665
of a controlled substance is a violation

16:35.690 --> 16:37.561
- that prevents us from granting
your request at this time.

16:37.586 --> 16:40.652
No!, No! That, I did...
That's not mine! I'm clean!

16:40.685 --> 16:43.055
Your parole is hereby denied.
You're to be

16:43.088 --> 16:44.957
remanded back to your unit for
the remainder of your sentence.

16:44.989 --> 16:46.279
Liz, you got to believe me, I'm clean!

16:46.304 --> 16:47.692
That is not mine! I swear to God

16:47.717 --> 16:50.896
- that's not mine, Liz.
- Call the next case.

16:53.937 --> 16:56.628
I really did envision
Tammy as president one day.

16:56.660 --> 16:58.905
It's just insult to injury

16:58.937 --> 17:00.676
that she, of all people,
would file a lawsuit.

17:01.690 --> 17:03.180
So it was personal?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.050
Of course it's personal.

17:07.521 --> 17:09.517
When I met Tammy,

17:09.551 --> 17:11.259
I saw a younger version of myself.

17:12.510 --> 17:14.190
I spent time and energy

17:14.222 --> 17:16.258
grooming her for a leadership position,

17:16.855 --> 17:18.638
and she let me down.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.660
There's nothing worse
than having to fire someone,

17:22.047 --> 17:23.880
especially when it's another woman.

17:23.913 --> 17:25.101
Yes.

17:25.133 --> 17:27.480
You know, I have a philosophy,
and it's pretty simple.

17:28.637 --> 17:30.005
Women need to help women.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.376
We need to raise each other up,

17:32.674 --> 17:34.800
and reach down the ladder when we can.

17:35.478 --> 17:38.752
That is the only way
this system changes.

17:39.074 --> 17:40.509
I totally agree.

17:40.682 --> 17:41.777
What about you?

17:42.998 --> 17:44.152
You're a partner at your own firm.

17:44.187 --> 17:46.591
Surely a woman reached
a hand down to you?

17:47.162 --> 17:49.037
Not a lot of women at the top.

17:49.392 --> 17:51.621
That gets old, doesn't it?

17:52.493 --> 17:54.853
Beingthe woman among the men?

17:55.393 --> 17:57.092
- Ladies.
- Yeah, thank you.

17:57.126 --> 17:59.269
My client, my treat.

18:05.213 --> 18:07.780
I know it's the donations table,

18:07.813 --> 18:10.308
but with those legs,
let's not have you sit.

18:10.333 --> 18:13.547
I want you to mingle with the guests,

18:13.572 --> 18:15.592
swipe as many cards as they'll give you.

18:16.079 --> 18:18.482
- No clue how to use this.
- Oh, I've used one before.

18:18.516 --> 18:20.443
- It's really easy.
- Ah. Perfect.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.853
And try to keep folks corralled

18:21.885 --> 18:23.363
into the living and dining
rooms... they don't need

18:23.388 --> 18:25.522
- to see our dirty laundry.
- Of course.

18:25.928 --> 18:27.658
Well, you keep a beautiful home, CeCe.

18:27.692 --> 18:30.690
- Oh, well, that's sweet of you to say, Jessie.
- Only thing

18:30.715 --> 18:33.584
I would suggest... route as many
people by the bar as possible.

18:33.609 --> 18:37.100
- More drinks means more money.
- Excellent point.

18:37.134 --> 18:38.469
I'm gonna go check on the caterers,

18:38.501 --> 18:40.062
so you make yourself at home, okay?

18:40.087 --> 18:41.139
I'll see you in a bit.

18:46.509 --> 18:48.512
Hi.

19:24.474 --> 19:25.875
Can I help you?

19:26.399 --> 19:27.444
Oh.

19:27.477 --> 19:30.280
Hey, uh, I was just
looking for the bathroom.

19:31.665 --> 19:33.369
It's right there.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.151
Thank you.

19:43.501 --> 19:45.226
Who the hell do you think you are?!

19:45.260 --> 19:47.262
I know what you did to Robby.

19:47.295 --> 19:48.465
You had drugs planted

19:48.490 --> 19:50.028
in his cell
so you could keep me in line?!

19:51.066 --> 19:52.583
It doesn't matter.

19:53.251 --> 19:55.470
This arrangement is over.

19:58.274 --> 20:00.510
Yeah? I don't care who knows it.

20:01.103 --> 20:02.763
I'm done with you, Terry!

20:03.470 --> 20:04.750
Feel better now?

20:05.343 --> 20:06.663
Got that out of your system?

20:06.696 --> 20:09.037
This is my brother's life
we're talking about.

20:09.062 --> 20:10.955
It's just business, Detective.

20:11.387 --> 20:12.922
Always protect your investment.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.948
I got people in every lockup
through South Texas

20:15.973 --> 20:17.542
who will do anything I say.

20:18.026 --> 20:21.275
So you and me... we're together
as long as I say we are.

20:22.031 --> 20:24.175
I want Dooley out,
and if you don't do it,

20:24.642 --> 20:26.400
next person who visits
your brother in prison

20:26.434 --> 20:29.048
ain't gonna be some guard on the take.

20:34.923 --> 20:36.005
Hey...

20:37.733 --> 20:39.276
You owe me a shirt.

20:49.271 --> 20:50.659
You really think she's one of them?

20:51.172 --> 20:54.877
At this point, I think
we have to assume the worst.

21:01.349 --> 21:03.085
Jackie, check it out.

21:34.450 --> 21:37.586
- Let me go!
- You better stop fighting me, boy.

21:39.066 --> 21:41.569
I don't like being embarrassed
in front of my guests, young man.

21:42.124 --> 21:44.492
I think he needs to learn
how to cooperate!

21:45.361 --> 21:46.629
I think you're right, Warden.

21:55.109 --> 21:56.411
Gil.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.089
You okay?

22:02.250 --> 22:03.074
Gil...

22:11.005 --> 22:12.040
What the hell is that?

22:12.073 --> 22:13.653
Tornado shelter.

22:28.231 --> 22:31.336
G, did they put you in there?

22:34.071 --> 22:35.139
No!

22:41.755 --> 22:42.847
Five days.

22:47.250 --> 22:48.593
They were trying to break me.

22:54.925 --> 22:57.136
I hope we have an understanding now.

22:59.297 --> 23:01.165
All right, get him out of there.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.619
Why didn't you tell us?

23:31.429 --> 23:33.098
Unbelievable.

23:33.131 --> 23:34.625
He's lucky he didn't die.

23:34.658 --> 23:35.831
Hey, Shawnie, look.

23:52.021 --> 23:53.535
Gil wasn't the only one.

24:09.131 --> 24:11.700
- Thanks, T.
- Don't thank me.

24:11.734 --> 24:14.035
Hope you're ready to work, Dooley.

24:14.342 --> 24:15.736
What's this?

24:16.270 --> 24:19.096
Job one. Need you to make
a delivery for me.

24:19.575 --> 24:20.613
After that...

24:21.323 --> 24:23.124
we'll discuss job two.

24:31.454 --> 24:34.400
Earlier today, you said,
"It was personal,"

24:34.433 --> 24:36.026
the reason why you were fired.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.427
Because it was.

24:37.747 --> 24:39.497
Okay. Let's talk

24:39.529 --> 24:42.399
about Diana Stockman's
personal interest in you.

24:44.157 --> 24:45.603
Didn't she pay off your student loans

24:45.635 --> 24:47.704
when you started at
Stockman Semiconductor?

24:47.738 --> 24:49.369
- Yes.
- And didn't she cover

24:49.394 --> 24:51.042
your graduate school expenses

24:51.075 --> 24:53.411
so you could get a master's
degree in business?

24:53.443 --> 24:55.512
Well, to get to a senior sales level,

24:55.546 --> 24:58.615
- you need a master's, so...
- So Ms. Stockman paid

24:58.648 --> 25:00.483
for the graduate degree that allowed you

25:00.517 --> 25:01.785
to move up to a senior position?

25:02.085 --> 25:04.543
Maybe that's why she was
so upset I got pregnant,

25:04.577 --> 25:06.171
after all of that investment.

25:06.204 --> 25:09.126
Or maybe it was your job performance.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.431
One of your responsibilities

25:13.463 --> 25:15.073
was to bring in new clients, correct?

25:15.598 --> 25:16.794
Yes.

25:16.828 --> 25:19.569
And wasn't it also your job
to attend conferences,

25:19.603 --> 25:23.169
build relationships and create
new leads for the business?

25:23.194 --> 25:25.704
Of course. That's Sales 101.

25:26.210 --> 25:27.872
Can you tell me what this is?

25:36.553 --> 25:37.866
It's a list of leads.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.408
Canned leads, right?

25:41.224 --> 25:43.802
That youpurchased  off the Internet

25:43.834 --> 25:45.874
so you could look like
you were doing your job.

25:46.081 --> 25:47.751
Okay, so I took a shortcut.

25:47.783 --> 25:50.119
Who hasn't bought leads
at least once in their career?

25:50.153 --> 25:51.121
I haven't.

25:51.154 --> 25:52.479
Object to the sidebar.

25:52.512 --> 25:54.458
Yes, I'm sure you will.

26:00.963 --> 26:02.465
Levi.

26:02.499 --> 26:04.601
I told you I'd make my way back to you.

26:04.634 --> 26:06.837
- Did we get you topped off?
- We did.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.039
So, what do you say?

26:11.381 --> 26:13.216
I knew I could count on you.

26:13.675 --> 26:15.740
You look like
a maximum kind of guy, Levi.

26:16.087 --> 26:18.088
Can I put you down for the maximum?

26:18.122 --> 26:20.225
You can put me down
however you want to, sweetheart.

26:22.093 --> 26:24.296
You throw a nice shindig, Ray.

26:24.328 --> 26:26.831
- Oh, that's all CeCe.
- With the help

26:26.865 --> 26:29.233
- of this little girl right here.
- Isn't she something?

26:29.267 --> 26:32.003
You keep her around, you're gonna go

26:32.036 --> 26:34.306
all the way to the White House.

26:34.338 --> 26:36.575
I might just do that.

26:39.911 --> 26:42.180
So the warden takes off with Petey,

26:42.212 --> 26:45.149
he leaves Red behind...
why would he do that?

26:45.183 --> 26:46.917
They were joined at the hip.

26:46.951 --> 26:49.587
Didn't Amy say that Red
went back over to E block?

26:49.621 --> 26:52.224
Oh, exactly. Why wouldn't
he go to the guard station

26:52.257 --> 26:54.025
or back out to the field?

26:54.058 --> 26:56.060
Maybe he was coming to get
Petey's belongings, you know?

26:56.094 --> 26:58.063
Destroy any evidence.

26:58.096 --> 27:00.231
Petey lived in A block, right?

27:00.264 --> 27:02.233
- Yeah.
- So why would Red go to E?

27:07.404 --> 27:08.940
Dude! What are you doing?

27:10.241 --> 27:11.576
Dude...

27:11.608 --> 27:13.010
- Okay.
- ...the walls, man!

27:13.044 --> 27:14.179
Tag the walls!

27:14.212 --> 27:15.480
- Do it!
- Hey!

27:17.014 --> 27:18.282
You think this is funny?

27:20.018 --> 27:21.886
- All right, get out of here.
- You know where you are?!

27:21.920 --> 27:24.022
- Get out!
- You know where you are?!

27:24.055 --> 27:26.024
- Get out.
- Do you have any idea where you are?!

27:26.057 --> 27:27.893
Get out.

27:27.925 --> 27:29.560
Get out of here.

27:32.497 --> 27:34.298
G...

27:34.331 --> 27:35.942
they're just stupid kids, man.

27:35.975 --> 27:37.915
I don't know what happened here, Gil.

27:38.796 --> 27:39.899
Nobody does.

27:41.972 --> 27:44.541
This is just an old shell
of a building that...

27:45.263 --> 27:46.956
doesn't mean anything to anyone.

27:50.989 --> 27:52.460
Except us.

28:17.137 --> 28:18.205
Come on, Gil.

28:18.237 --> 28:19.849
Take me instead. Please.

28:29.762 --> 28:32.465
Warden doesn't wantyou, Jackie boy.

29:27.719 --> 29:29.855
Gil.

29:29.887 --> 29:31.423
Gil.

29:43.835 --> 29:45.160
Let's get out of here.

29:51.982 --> 29:54.451
Well, there's the mailboxes,
just like Bobby said.

29:55.029 --> 29:56.787
Ah, see? I told you guys
he was telling the truth.

29:56.820 --> 29:59.490
So this is it, then...
this is the last place

29:59.523 --> 30:00.690
we can track Petey to.

30:01.317 --> 30:02.760
I mean, the warden could've taken him

30:02.793 --> 30:04.495
a hundred different directions
from here.

30:12.735 --> 30:14.670
What? What's wrong?

30:15.162 --> 30:17.541
The train never used
to stop here before.

30:41.197 --> 30:43.167
Whew.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.104
Let's go. Come on.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.505
That's the field

30:48.537 --> 30:50.540
- where we cleared all the stumps.
- I know.

30:50.573 --> 30:52.543
So they could put up a bunch of...

30:52.575 --> 30:53.709
warehouses?

30:53.743 --> 30:55.178
What's that about?

31:01.318 --> 31:02.453
Cheers.

31:02.485 --> 31:03.918
Listen, thanks for doing this.

31:04.521 --> 31:06.957
I'm on the board, so, at some point,
we're gonna have to mingle.

31:08.557 --> 31:11.527
So, how long have
you and Jackson been engaged?

31:12.171 --> 31:13.797
Not that long, actually.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.532
Is it that obvious?

31:15.564 --> 31:16.833
It's not obvious.

31:16.867 --> 31:19.703
But that small planet
on your finger suggests

31:19.735 --> 31:21.839
that you are engaged tosomeone.

31:22.119 --> 31:23.207
Are you married?

31:23.688 --> 31:24.708
I was once.

31:24.943 --> 31:26.109
Only once.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.044
And honestly, it was a mistake.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.548
I don't think I'd be where I am today

31:30.998 --> 31:32.549
if I was still with him.

31:32.582 --> 31:33.516
Really? Why?

31:34.044 --> 31:35.719
We worked together.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.188
And some people can do that well.

31:39.222 --> 31:41.191
But our careers...

31:41.616 --> 31:43.092
they took different paths.

31:44.753 --> 31:46.530
He did not handle it well.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.959
Mm. I've seen that before.

31:48.993 --> 31:50.501
Men can be very defensive

31:51.163 --> 31:52.535
if they're not secure.

31:52.569 --> 31:54.914
Well, lucky for him,
I didn't ask for a prenup.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.594
So he did very well for himself.

31:58.108 --> 32:01.544
Anyway, don't get me wrong, I'd love
to have had a successful marriage...

32:01.867 --> 32:03.814
'cause I don't like to fail at anything.

32:04.389 --> 32:05.782
I'm sorry.

32:05.814 --> 32:06.981
I'm not.

32:08.118 --> 32:10.521
Women say "I'm sorry" too much,
don't you think?

32:10.553 --> 32:12.121
Actually, yes.

32:12.886 --> 32:14.675
Enough talk about my ex-husband.
Come on.

32:14.708 --> 32:16.527
I want to show you off.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.162
Okay.

32:19.195 --> 32:21.599
Whew.

32:23.332 --> 32:26.168
Ah, what a great night.

32:26.201 --> 32:28.704
If this doesn't call for some bubbly,

32:28.737 --> 32:30.375
I don't know what does.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.543
- Hm. Shouldn't we toast with Ray?
- Mm.

32:32.577 --> 32:34.278
We'll just be waiting forever.

32:34.311 --> 32:37.014
He's always off doing something

32:37.046 --> 32:39.549
campaign-y, bless his heart.

32:39.915 --> 32:41.250
It never ends.

32:43.186 --> 32:44.310
To you.

32:44.927 --> 32:46.256
I don't think we've ever raised

32:46.289 --> 32:48.992
this much money in a single event.

32:49.024 --> 32:51.594
Well, you throw a lovely party, CeCe.

32:51.628 --> 32:52.408
Mm.

32:54.197 --> 32:55.098
You know,

32:55.791 --> 32:58.701
I might just take this up
to the bathtub.

32:58.735 --> 33:02.171
You do that. I'm gonna grab this
stuff and get out of your hair.

33:02.205 --> 33:04.574
Thank you, Jessie.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.569
You were terrific.

33:05.602 --> 33:06.943
- You're welcome.
- Hm.

33:27.764 --> 33:30.167
One of these men ended
your husband's life.

33:30.199 --> 33:31.959
It's just a matter of
time till we find out

33:31.991 --> 33:33.169
which one.

34:36.331 --> 34:40.302
Hey. Welcome back, bro.

34:40.335 --> 34:41.839
Good to see you, bro.

34:43.706 --> 34:44.340
Time for job two.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.380
7-7s moved in on your territory
while you were gone.

34:51.014 --> 34:52.882
You're taking it back tonight.

34:58.854 --> 35:01.090
It's slave labor, man.

35:01.436 --> 35:03.419
It can't be just for the prison.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.557
No, it's run by CSA now.

35:07.262 --> 35:10.001
First with the stumps.
Now who knows what it is?

35:10.867 --> 35:13.993
They can contract these kids out
to whoever they want.

35:20.142 --> 35:22.044
Oh, my God.

35:22.077 --> 35:23.913
Bausch Nursery.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.985
As in Terry Bausch? Quitman Terry?

35:29.017 --> 35:30.986
Yeah. What the hell
are his vans doing out here?

35:31.019 --> 35:34.323
No idea. But I'm guessing
it's not cow crap in those bags.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.195
Hey!

35:39.229 --> 35:41.331
- Can I help you?
- No, sir. No, sir. We're good.

35:41.363 --> 35:42.298
- This is private property.
- Yeah.

35:42.331 --> 35:43.432
Hey.

35:43.465 --> 35:44.299
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:44.334 --> 35:46.203
What the hell are you guys doing? Hey!

35:58.263 --> 35:59.365
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:00.087 --> 36:01.247
This is the same guy

36:01.284 --> 36:03.274
in the mug shots
Detective Winters showed Annie.

36:03.299 --> 36:05.288
Same red hair. Same stupid face.

36:05.322 --> 36:07.381
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, can we just...

36:07.413 --> 36:08.833
back up here a second?

36:08.941 --> 36:10.843
What the hell are you doing
at a Ray Carroll fund-raiser?

36:10.876 --> 36:12.979
I'm volunteering at his campaign.

36:13.012 --> 36:15.081
- What?
- I told you, I'm a part of this, too.

36:15.113 --> 36:17.883
I want to help, see what I can find out.

36:17.916 --> 36:19.351
I can get close to Carroll.

36:20.003 --> 36:20.740
Already have.

36:20.765 --> 36:22.559
- I don't want you anywhere
near the warden! What are you...

36:22.591 --> 36:24.923
Look, I saw this guy handing Carroll
an envelope,

36:24.957 --> 36:27.026
- so I followed him.
- You followed him?!

36:27.059 --> 36:28.818
Yes, I followed him.

36:28.851 --> 36:30.305
To some gardening place.

36:30.338 --> 36:31.630
Bausch Nursery.

36:36.901 --> 36:38.083
What?

36:39.003 --> 36:40.707
This guy's working for Terry,

36:40.740 --> 36:42.875
playing courier between him
and the warden,

36:42.908 --> 36:45.345
and he was in the same cellblock
as Boots.

36:45.378 --> 36:46.946
That is not a coincidence.

36:46.979 --> 36:49.082
This is the guy
that shanked Boots. Has to be.

36:49.115 --> 36:50.783
- Right.
- Listen to me,

36:50.816 --> 36:52.984
this is over. It's done.

36:53.017 --> 36:55.114
Listen, I don't want you
anywhere near Warden Carroll!

36:55.148 --> 36:57.647
- Gil, it's not done.
- Well, if it involves that prick, it is!

36:57.681 --> 37:00.392
- It's not up to you!
- Gil's right, Jess.

37:00.425 --> 37:02.064
No, he's-he's not.

37:02.961 --> 37:04.370
What's that?

37:06.432 --> 37:08.026
The warden knows us.

37:08.674 --> 37:10.570
He doesn't know Jessie. She can help us.

37:10.602 --> 37:12.274
She has a right to help us.

37:12.604 --> 37:14.611
And we need to take advantage of it.

37:23.624 --> 37:24.850
No.

37:24.883 --> 37:25.984
No!

37:26.017 --> 37:27.019
Gil!

37:30.063 --> 37:32.389
Hey, Jessie... hey, you want to do this,

37:32.423 --> 37:35.303
all right, he's got a point...
you have to be careful.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.905
I know. I will.

37:37.938 --> 37:39.740
But we need answers, right?

37:41.474 --> 37:43.978
Yeah. We do.

37:53.419 --> 37:55.158
Oh, honey.

37:57.969 --> 37:59.972
I'm sorry.

38:02.460 --> 38:05.470
I can't believe
that Robby's using again either.

38:06.803 --> 38:09.162
How many chances
does he think he's gonna get?

38:09.826 --> 38:12.250
Robby is that baby's daddy.

38:13.891 --> 38:16.195
He'll get his act together.

38:17.276 --> 38:18.911
There's nothing you can do
to help your brother,

38:18.944 --> 38:21.714
if he won't help himself.

38:22.034 --> 38:23.682
It's not on you, Liz.

38:24.783 --> 38:26.187
Don't beat yourself up.

38:37.663 --> 38:40.632
The size of that corporation.

38:40.665 --> 38:43.702
Did you know that Diana runs
eight different tech companies

38:43.736 --> 38:46.439
alone? And she took me
to a party tonight

38:46.471 --> 38:48.674
at the modern art museum.
And she's been on the board

38:48.707 --> 38:50.810
forever. I just... I don't think

38:50.843 --> 38:53.663
I've ever met someone so accomplished.

38:54.136 --> 38:56.582
Well, she certainly looks great
for her age.

38:58.746 --> 39:00.285
Really?

39:03.946 --> 39:05.024
What?

39:05.522 --> 39:07.303
That's your takeaway?

39:10.323 --> 39:11.464
It-It's a compliment.

39:11.497 --> 39:12.665
Diana Stockman is

39:12.698 --> 39:17.469
a wildly successful CEO of a
multibillion-dollar corporation.

39:17.502 --> 39:19.904
A CEO who could make our firm
a lot of money.

39:19.937 --> 39:22.642
I know. I get it. I'm...

39:27.607 --> 39:29.714
Did you just get out of the shower?

39:29.747 --> 39:32.718
Yeah. Yeah, I had a late run.

39:34.719 --> 39:36.656
I did you a favor, trust me.

39:38.220 --> 39:40.758
So, how did the, uh...
how did the deposition go?

39:41.397 --> 39:42.989
I made a great impression.

39:44.013 --> 39:45.196
And?

39:46.283 --> 39:49.700
And... I should probably
put in a few more hours

39:49.734 --> 39:51.770
on my motion to compel.

39:51.803 --> 39:53.305
I'm gonna go back to the office.

39:53.339 --> 39:55.261
Marina, don't.

39:56.484 --> 39:57.843
Why not?

39:57.875 --> 39:59.879
You do it all the time.

40:39.889 --> 40:40.753
Hey.

40:41.181 --> 40:42.449
Hey.

40:43.781 --> 40:44.716
You sure this is okay?

40:45.237 --> 40:47.659
After today,
I just kind of needed to talk.

40:48.493 --> 40:49.660
Me, too.

40:57.488 --> 40:59.015
He wouldn't talk to you at all?

40:59.776 --> 41:01.781
Said there was nothing to talk about.

41:02.944 --> 41:05.510
There's not a lot of middle
ground with Gil, is there?

41:05.544 --> 41:06.979
No.

41:07.011 --> 41:08.934
No, not really.

41:10.036 --> 41:11.449
He'll come around.

41:12.588 --> 41:14.143
He loves you, Jessie.

41:15.153 --> 41:16.050
I know.

41:17.710 --> 41:18.824
He was just really upset with me,

41:18.857 --> 41:20.704
like he's never been before.

41:22.219 --> 41:24.430
I just worry what this
is gonna do to him...
