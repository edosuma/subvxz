WEBVTT

00:03.889 --> 00:06.772
ER

00:06.873 --> 00:08.255
Previously on ER...

00:08.256 --> 00:11.540
Gamma, if that is all you think of me,
then you can keep your money.

00:11.541 --> 00:12.859
As you wish, John.

00:12.860 --> 00:13.860
Cancer's back.

00:13.861 --> 00:18.102
Your bone marrow failed to match
the last two potential donors.

00:18.503 --> 00:20.522
I don't want any more chemo.

00:21.970 --> 00:24.657
- Gather all the charts and the tape.
- The tape?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.866
We often tape laparoscopic procedures.

00:26.867 --> 00:29.966
Don't pull so hard with the Babcock.
You'll tear the gastric artery.

00:29.967 --> 00:31.662
- I'm not pulling.
- Oh, son of a bitch!

00:31.663 --> 00:33.908
- He's lost too much blood. Let's open.
- We're losing him.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.578
Doctor, it's been three minutes.

00:35.579 --> 00:37.250
He's dying. Move!

00:38.173 --> 00:40.855
"Shades Of Gray"

00:45.721 --> 00:47.344
Cubs fan, huh?

00:47.555 --> 00:50.045
- Please don't touch that.
- Right. I'm sorry.

00:52.224 --> 00:55.426
Before I make any decisions about
your loan application...

00:55.643 --> 00:57.717
...I have to clarify a few points.

00:57.894 --> 00:59.091
Yeah?

00:59.353 --> 01:03.847
You only included one tax return,
1996, listing your income...

01:04.063 --> 01:08.807
...as a surgical resident with
an annual salary of $28,000?

01:09.025 --> 01:10.898
Yeah. Before taxes.

01:11.610 --> 01:14.692
We'll need your other returns
from previous years.

01:14.902 --> 01:17.606
There aren't any. Before that,
I was a med student.

01:17.821 --> 01:18.899
No summer jobs?

01:19.238 --> 01:20.648
Well, I...

01:21.405 --> 01:24.690
- ... crewed in the Whitbread in 1990.
- Where was that?

01:25.282 --> 01:27.819
Capetown. Fremantle.

01:28.034 --> 01:30.073
Capsized between Sydney and Auckland.

01:31.869 --> 01:33.244
It's a yacht race.

01:33.412 --> 01:35.238
And you earned?

01:36.205 --> 01:40.496
A few thousand.
But after living expenses...

01:41.541 --> 01:43.164
I spent more than I made.

01:43.501 --> 01:47.745
You're a Resident in emergency
medicine now. Is that correct?

01:48.252 --> 01:53.209
Yeah. When I shifted from surgery,
I agreed to do so without pay.

01:54.298 --> 01:57.166
But I'm gonna ask for a paycheck
next year, for sure.

01:57.382 --> 01:59.041
I would hope so.

02:00.301 --> 02:01.758
What about this trust fund?

02:01.926 --> 02:04.842
The holdings are in
my grandfather's name...

02:05.053 --> 02:07.803
...and I am no longer
drawing funds from it.

02:08.012 --> 02:10.419
Would he be willing to
cosign for your loan?

02:10.639 --> 02:14.421
I want my application to be
judged on its own merits.

02:14.599 --> 02:17.136
- On its own merits, I must reject it.
- Why?

02:17.351 --> 02:18.892
Either talk to your grandfather...

02:19.101 --> 02:23.428
...or acquaint yourself with
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

02:24.896 --> 02:27.682
- Peter?
- Dr. Morgenstern.

02:29.024 --> 02:33.599
I looked over your report for the
Morbidity and Mortality Conference.

02:33.817 --> 02:36.188
It was quite evenhanded.

02:36.402 --> 02:38.892
Well, I just charted what happened.

02:39.112 --> 02:42.444
Sometimes these things can become
so "he said, she said. "

02:42.613 --> 02:44.735
- There's no need for that.
- No, no.

02:45.407 --> 02:49.189
Lizzie and I did an aortobifemoral
bypass in 2 hours, 20 minutes.

02:49.409 --> 02:51.401
Well, that's wonderful, Robert.

02:51.618 --> 02:54.950
Is M and M still on, or can I buy
Lizzie a five-egg omelet?

02:55.120 --> 02:56.282
It's still on.

02:56.496 --> 02:59.116
Looks like you're not out of
the hot seat yet.

02:59.330 --> 03:00.409
Will Anspaugh be there?

03:00.622 --> 03:04.701
No. He requested that I messenger
the meeting notes over to his house.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.079
Is the funeral today?

03:06.292 --> 03:08.960
- Yeah.
- I sent flowers from the department.

03:11.753 --> 03:14.669
Well, looks like a cruller
and a Coke is all we have time for.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.525
My treat!

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:39.412 --> 04:43.158
Mark? I'm going to a surgical
M and M. Can you cover for an hour?

04:43.330 --> 04:44.658
Sure, what's going on?

04:44.831 --> 04:46.324
It's the Swanson laparoscopy.

04:46.540 --> 04:47.868
Right. Peter's case.

04:48.082 --> 04:49.492
It's actually Dr. Morgenstern.

04:49.708 --> 04:53.205
Right. Have fun.
I'll hold down the fort.

04:53.417 --> 04:54.496
I thought you said...

04:54.667 --> 04:55.995
- ... he's the best.
- He is!

04:56.169 --> 04:58.041
He rolled my med school loan into...

04:58.252 --> 05:00.623
...a Sallie Mae, Fannie Mae, Ellie Mae,
whatever.

05:00.837 --> 05:04.204
All I know is I don't have to eat
meals out of a can anymore.

05:04.422 --> 05:06.496
- Did you catch that Sox game?
- Missed it.

05:06.714 --> 05:10.247
Center fielder, pop fly,
catching a few z's. Pay up!

05:10.466 --> 05:12.089
I'm short right now.
Can I get you?

05:12.300 --> 05:15.334
Sure. I know you're good for it.

05:15.676 --> 05:18.000
My aunt made a killing
selling Tupperware.

05:18.219 --> 05:21.088
- Tupperware?
- Those little plastic storage things-

05:21.303 --> 05:23.757
- I know what Tupperware is.
- How about Amway?

05:23.971 --> 05:26.923
- You're really enjoying this.
- Yeah, a little.

05:27.181 --> 05:29.586
- Heads up, doctors!
- Carter, you're up.

05:30.348 --> 05:32.506
This day gets better and better,
doesn't it?

05:32.682 --> 05:34.010
Grabarsky, who do you got?

05:34.225 --> 05:38.136
Mike Lembreaux. Doesn't know
when to say when. Fell over a curb.

05:38.352 --> 05:41.054
A curb? Maybe we should
have those removed.

05:41.269 --> 05:42.679
His wrist looks pretty bad.

05:42.853 --> 05:46.219
Well, from the smell of things,
we can skip the pain medication.

05:46.521 --> 05:48.642
Let's check out that wrist,
Mr. Lembreaux.

05:48.855 --> 05:52.186
I wanted to eulogize him somehow,
but I...

05:54.024 --> 05:57.106
I never felt comfortable
in his mother's church.

05:58.234 --> 06:01.233
So austere.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.691
No pomp and ceremony, just...

06:04.861 --> 06:06.900
...silent judgment.

06:08.113 --> 06:10.816
I thought the silence
was for contemplation.

06:11.864 --> 06:13.441
It's just...

06:13.698 --> 06:17.693
Well, you can imagine how
her Quaker parents felt...

06:17.908 --> 06:20.991
...when she brought home
a West Point man.

06:23.327 --> 06:25.448
Well, you ended up getting married.

06:26.161 --> 06:27.323
Yeah.

06:28.704 --> 06:30.778
The hawk and the dove.

06:33.456 --> 06:35.079
Long time ago.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.868
Scotty...

06:41.458 --> 06:45.584
...wanted you to have
the stuff in this box.

06:49.629 --> 06:51.086
Green Day.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.381
I'm surprised he didn't burn a hole
through this one.

07:00.007 --> 07:02.876
- What?
- Soap Opera Digest.

07:04.885 --> 07:08.334
I knew he was getting those future
plots from somewhere.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.631
The most important aspect of
M and M...

07:11.845 --> 07:14.251
...is not to linger on our missteps...

07:14.472 --> 07:17.424
...but to analyze every case
as a teaching tool.

07:18.889 --> 07:20.217
Dr. Benton.

07:29.769 --> 07:30.847
Thank you.

07:31.394 --> 07:33.303
- Gonna need a reduction.
- An open reduction.

07:33.521 --> 07:38.428
- Internal fixation in the O.R.
- Not so fast. You're not in surgery.

07:38.647 --> 07:41.220
I got my real ones knocked out
in Joliet.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.894
He can't breathe!
He can't breathe!

07:44.108 --> 07:47.060
- I'm showing him something.
- Keep breathing on the nebulizer.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.902
- Leave this kid alone.
- Get him out of here.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.854
- Put your teeth back in your mouth.
- I can talk to anybody!

07:53.070 --> 07:54.232
Take deep breaths.

07:54.404 --> 07:56.359
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave me alone!

07:59.280 --> 08:01.567
Guys, get the soft restraints!

08:01.739 --> 08:03.696
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

08:03.908 --> 08:05.566
Stop it! Leave me alone!

08:06.533 --> 08:08.074
Please help him!

08:09.534 --> 08:12.403
You'll be fine. He's cyanotic!
I'm gonna intubate him.

08:12.619 --> 08:14.278
- Check his right wrist.
- I'm intubating.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.444
- Get me 40 of ketamine.
- Forty of ketamine

08:17.037 --> 08:19.243
What are you doing bringing
a psycho in here?

08:19.413 --> 08:22.661
- I didn't realize.
- This boy is a critical asthma patient.

08:22.873 --> 08:25.078
Nobody cares about Pedes.
5.0 ETtube.

08:25.249 --> 08:28.034
- I'm really sorry.
- Here we go. Give me suction.

08:28.250 --> 08:32.409
Morgenstern's attempt to control the
hemorrhage by incision was futile.

08:32.626 --> 08:36.159
Bleeding obscured the operative field,
but we were controlling it.

08:36.586 --> 08:39.206
- It was difficult.
- What did you do next?

08:39.421 --> 08:40.830
Called for additional suction.

08:41.046 --> 08:43.914
Then you decided to change
course and open the chest.

08:44.131 --> 08:45.588
Who made that incision?

08:48.883 --> 08:49.913
I did.

08:50.134 --> 08:52.255
Morgenstern allowed you
to crack the chest?

08:52.426 --> 08:54.085
- Not exactly-
- I didn't feel it-

08:54.302 --> 08:56.423
Gentlemen, one at a time.

08:57.094 --> 08:58.256
Dr. Benton?

09:01.554 --> 09:02.882
I took over the surgery.

09:03.097 --> 09:04.590
What do you mean, "take over"?

09:04.806 --> 09:08.588
In the heat of the moment,
Dr. Benton became agitated.

09:08.807 --> 09:10.182
Dr. Benton?

09:12.266 --> 09:13.546
I pushed him aside.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.889
What was your justification
for such an action?

09:16.102 --> 09:17.263
The man was bleeding out.

09:17.643 --> 09:20.678
The midline incision was adequate.
It was the varices.

09:20.937 --> 09:23.427
No. He needed
to be cracked immediately.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.094
And that justifies committing battery?

09:26.272 --> 09:28.429
The man was dying.
Would you have stood there?

09:28.606 --> 09:30.563
I would have assisted the Attending.

09:30.774 --> 09:33.263
After three minutes of
arterial bleeding...

09:33.442 --> 09:36.394
...cross-clamping the aorta was
the only alternative.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.565
No, Peter. I don't think it was.

09:38.777 --> 09:40.603
No, it was the only alternative!

09:40.777 --> 09:43.184
Gentlemen, it's best to adjourn...

09:43.362 --> 09:47.025
...and convene a resident review
at 12:30 to discuss it.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.696
I agree. Dr. Morgenstern?

09:48.948 --> 09:52.990
Yes. I think that would be for the best.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.444
What do we have here?

09:56.659 --> 09:59.776
A 28-year-old woman, 18 weeks
pregnant, found unconscious.

09:59.952 --> 10:03.117
- GCS 11, multiple lacs, vitals stable.
- Let's go!

10:03.328 --> 10:05.284
The Chicago Reproductive Center
was bombed.

10:05.496 --> 10:06.776
The abortion clinic?

10:06.954 --> 10:11.115
They also do prenatal care. They're
still pulling people from the rubble.

10:11.331 --> 10:12.872
Blowing up clinics. Bastards!

10:13.082 --> 10:15.867
- How many we got?
- No idea. It's chaos down there.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.125
We got a 17-year-old, second trimester.
Chest pain, shortness of breath.

10:20.459 --> 10:24.289
BP's real low, 80/50.
Pulse 120. Resps 24.

10:24.461 --> 10:26.785
You're gonna be okay.
You're at a hospital.

10:27.003 --> 10:28.118
- Donny?
- I'm right here.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.460
- Her name?
- Zoe Kearney. A wall fell on her.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.580
- How far along is she?
- Six months.

10:32.756 --> 10:33.787
Clear Trauma 1!

10:34.007 --> 10:37.006
We can't release patient
information over the phone.

10:37.216 --> 10:40.548
The hospital has no official
comment at this time.

10:40.759 --> 10:44.422
It's the Trib. They want to know
if any abortion docs died.

10:44.636 --> 10:47.385
They're "gynecologists. "
We don't have any information.

10:47.595 --> 10:50.345
A vanload of protesters with
minor injuries came in.

10:50.555 --> 10:52.961
Triage them.
We're swamped with criticals.

10:53.222 --> 10:56.470
Something's wrong with my ears.
No one is helping me.

10:56.641 --> 10:58.678
We're really busy, but someone will
get to you as soon as they can.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.598
Please! I've been in a bombing.

11:00.809 --> 11:03.594
I know. We'll get you a room
as soon as we can.

11:05.727 --> 11:07.055
Have somebody look at that.

11:07.270 --> 11:09.474
- What?
- Your head.

11:09.646 --> 11:10.676
Thirty-two French.

11:10.854 --> 11:12.228
- Urine dip's negative.
- Blood gas?

11:12.480 --> 11:17.186
PO289. PCO225.
PH 7.29 on 10 liters.

11:17.399 --> 11:18.642
Borderline, but okay.

11:18.815 --> 11:20.143
Resps down to 27.

11:20.316 --> 11:23.683
Fetal heart rate 140.
No contractions. Mom's 110/60.

11:23.901 --> 11:25.892
- Where's my boyfriend?
- He's outside.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.140
Is he okay?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.316
- He's fine. Relax.
- Still want the blood?

11:29.486 --> 11:32.106
Hang a unit of red cells.
Get her to CT.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.988
- Come on, let's go. Got it?
- Yeah.

11:35.197 --> 11:36.571
Send her blood to Radiology.

11:36.781 --> 11:38.487
- Where's she going?
- Taking her to CT.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.778
- What's on the scope?
- Sinus tach at 120.

11:40.991 --> 11:44.155
- Let OB know where we're going!
- I'm right behind you, okay?

11:44.992 --> 11:47.113
Was she in for an abortion
or prenatal care?

11:47.326 --> 11:50.528
She's 18, 19 weeks. Kind of
late for an AB, don't you think?

11:50.744 --> 11:52.570
We've got fetal heart tones, 145.

11:52.787 --> 11:56.485
CBC, type and cross for four
units, and cath a urine.

11:56.663 --> 11:59.828
Pulse ox 98. BP 90/70.
Good cap refill.

12:00.331 --> 12:01.659
Also get a chest.

12:01.874 --> 12:04.743
Shield her abdomen
and let's prep her for a pelvic.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.159
I've got her chart. Brianna Thomas,
18-week-pregnant nullip.

12:08.376 --> 12:11.577
- In for a suction extraction.
- An abortion?

12:11.836 --> 12:13.827
Looks like they didn't finish.

12:14.503 --> 12:16.578
BP's dropped, 80/50. Pulse 110.

12:16.795 --> 12:19.001
She's hemorrhaging.
Complete the AB.

12:19.213 --> 12:20.328
Grab a gyn tray.

12:20.839 --> 12:23.507
Grab a tray!
We need to evacuate the uterus.

12:24.007 --> 12:27.172
- Now, doctor.
- I can't.

12:29.342 --> 12:31.500
Speculum! Betadine!

12:31.843 --> 12:34.297
Set suction on high, and get me...

12:34.511 --> 12:36.467
...a size 14 cannula. Let's go!

12:36.679 --> 12:41.069
- Second liter's in.
- Hang a third and repeat a crit.

12:44.704 --> 12:46.698
Anna? Can I speak to you
for a moment?

12:46.916 --> 12:48.161
Sure.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.460
- Kerry, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

12:56.931 --> 12:58.972
What happened in that trauma today?

12:59.184 --> 13:02.140
- I'm sorry. I froze.
- That can't happen.

13:02.356 --> 13:03.685
I couldn't complete the abortion.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.359
- Why not?
- I don't know.

13:05.569 --> 13:08.572
The fetus was so far along and-

13:08.783 --> 13:11.405
What about Brianna Thomas?
Your patient was hemorrhaging.

13:11.620 --> 13:14.030
I don't know. I didn't ex-

13:14.250 --> 13:16.042
The baby had a chance, you know?

13:16.253 --> 13:19.706
There are patients and procedures
that we might find distasteful-

13:19.925 --> 13:23.925
Distasteful? Come on, Kerry,
I'm not squeamish. It just felt wrong.

13:24.140 --> 13:28.010
We can't allow our feelings
to dictate our standard of care.

13:28.187 --> 13:29.220
- I don't.
- But you did.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.398
Your moral objection to abortion-

13:31.610 --> 13:33.235
I don't have a moral objection!

13:33.446 --> 13:35.985
Well, something happened
in there today.

13:38.412 --> 13:40.406
I'm his son, Burke.
He lives with me.

13:40.624 --> 13:42.166
How long has he been wetting the bed?

13:42.376 --> 13:44.999
Maybe two days.
He smelled pretty bad.

13:45.214 --> 13:47.789
- He's had urine infections before.
- Right.

13:48.010 --> 13:50.087
Temp's 102, and he looks dehydrated.

13:50.305 --> 13:53.225
We try to get him to eat
or drink, but he won't.

13:53.435 --> 13:57.269
Let's start a line of normal saline.
Give him a 500 cc bolus.

13:57.441 --> 14:00.016
CBC, Chem-20, blood cultures
times two, urine CNS.

14:00.279 --> 14:01.311
You got it.

14:02.157 --> 14:04.067
I don't think that's necessary.

14:04.286 --> 14:06.529
Before, they just gave him antibiotics.

14:06.748 --> 14:08.409
We need to do a full evaluation.

14:09.168 --> 14:13.120
- If you're worried about being sued-
- It's nothing to do with being sued.

14:13.341 --> 14:15.085
You'll poke him and prod him...

14:15.302 --> 14:18.755
...and then thousands of dollars later,
you'll give him antibiotics.

14:19.309 --> 14:21.801
Go have a seat while we
work on your dad.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.476
Unbe-friggin-lievable!

14:23.691 --> 14:26.479
Grab a blood gas kit and show
Mr. Newton to Chairs.

14:26.653 --> 14:28.064
I can show myself.

14:29.241 --> 14:30.320
He's a charmer.

14:31.119 --> 14:33.611
When's the last time anyone
bathed this guy?

14:34.666 --> 14:38.083
From the looks of these bedsores,
about the same time they turned him.

14:38.672 --> 14:40.915
So much for "honor thy father. "

14:41.176 --> 14:44.511
I don't understand your argument.
The decision has been made.

14:44.723 --> 14:47.180
Dr. Benton allowed his emotions
to get a little out of hand.

14:47.352 --> 14:49.013
Otherwise, he's a good resident.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.731
Who committed battery.

14:50.941 --> 14:54.146
Peter's a good surgeon.
But you can't let this stand.

14:54.363 --> 14:57.033
Like you said, Dr. Weaver,
the decision's been made.

14:57.242 --> 14:58.868
Unless you have a problem with it?

15:00.498 --> 15:01.577
No.

15:02.876 --> 15:05.665
Debra, would you ask Dr. Benton
to come in, please?

15:19.109 --> 15:23.026
Dr. Benton, we have reviewed
Dr. Swanson's chart and the autopsy.

15:23.241 --> 15:26.528
I thought the autopsy was inconclusive
due to the state of the body.

15:26.746 --> 15:30.580
Regardless, this committee feels the
matter warrants further investigation.

15:30.794 --> 15:34.746
I don't know what to say. Everything
I saw and did is in this report.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.676
Chart aside, you pushed an Attending.

15:36.887 --> 15:39.427
You're out of the rotation
pending a formal inquiry.

15:43.856 --> 15:44.888
You're suspending me?

15:45.109 --> 15:48.444
Until Dr. Anspaugh returns
and there's a full investigation.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.236
When can I return to my job?

15:53.454 --> 15:55.032
We don't know yet.

15:55.791 --> 15:57.951
- And this is effective...?
- Immediately.

16:08.936 --> 16:13.067
She threw three PVCs, unifocal,
no R on T. Should I give her lidocaine?

16:13.277 --> 16:14.308
Three? No. Let's observe.

16:14.528 --> 16:17.531
Her chest tube stopped draining.
300 cc's.

16:17.742 --> 16:19.285
Resps are a little high at 26.

16:19.495 --> 16:22.866
Zoe, we looked at your CT.
There's no evidence of organ damage.

16:23.084 --> 16:25.457
We still want to
admit you for observation.

16:25.671 --> 16:27.250
- For how long?
- We're not sure.

16:27.966 --> 16:29.426
It's kind of hard to breathe.

16:29.635 --> 16:31.511
- Pulse ox always 94?
- No. It's down.

16:31.722 --> 16:33.632
I'm fine. What about the baby?

16:33.850 --> 16:37.850
You have fetal heart tones,
which means that the baby is alive.

16:38.023 --> 16:39.518
As for kicking, you tell me.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.109
- We should name him Lucky, huh?
- "Her. "

16:42.280 --> 16:44.654
- I have a feeling.
- Do you want to see him or her?

16:44.868 --> 16:46.945
- We're gonna do an ultrasound.
- Yeah, cool.

16:48.956 --> 16:49.989
Zoe, what's wrong?

16:50.167 --> 16:52.327
- BP's down to 60 palp.
- Are you in pain?

16:52.546 --> 16:55.252
- Pulse ox 90!
- She's bradying down! Let's go!

16:55.467 --> 16:57.128
Hang on. Step back!

16:57.387 --> 17:00.224
Pulse is 40. You gotta give us
room to work here.

17:00.434 --> 17:01.679
Oh, no! No!

17:01.894 --> 17:03.223
- Pulmonary embolus?
- Probably.

17:03.438 --> 17:06.393
- Repeat a gas,.5 atropine.
- Damn!

17:06.567 --> 17:08.560
All right. Start CPR.

17:11.409 --> 17:12.903
This one is almost to the bone.

17:13.078 --> 17:16.579
I've seen all I need to see.
I'll put this paperwork through.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.752
Hopefully, we'll get him
into an extended care facility.

17:19.963 --> 17:22.586
- I'd appreciate it.
- I just need you to sign this.

17:22.759 --> 17:24.884
I'll run it down to the courthouse.

17:25.096 --> 17:27.221
Thank you for taking
care of this so quickly.

17:27.434 --> 17:31.765
I'd say it was my pleasure, but see
how people treat their own parents?

17:31.982 --> 17:33.098
Yeah.

17:35.946 --> 17:39.033
Dr. Carter, what gives?
I've been sitting here forever.

17:39.243 --> 17:42.281
Your father exhibited
textbook signs of neglect.

17:42.457 --> 17:44.866
- That's crazy.
- He hasn't been bathed for weeks.

17:45.085 --> 17:48.338
He's covered in feces.
He's got bedsores to the bone.

17:48.591 --> 17:51.297
I've recommended that he be placed
in an adult-care facility.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.548
You don't have any say.
I have power of attorney.

17:53.766 --> 17:56.305
The hospital has claimed
temporary guardianship.

17:56.479 --> 17:59.053
Really? Who'll pay?
I handle the Medicare.

17:59.274 --> 18:03.226
His Medicare payments will be
transferred to the facility he's in.

18:06.535 --> 18:08.612
Expect to hear from my lawyer.

18:09.290 --> 18:10.701
Look forward to it.

18:11.502 --> 18:13.828
It feels like there's something in there.

18:14.047 --> 18:16.504
With all that glass flying
after the explosion...

18:16.676 --> 18:18.634
...I didn't want to take a chance.

18:18.846 --> 18:20.721
No, you did the right thing.

18:21.683 --> 18:25.019
It's so sad. These extremists...

18:25.231 --> 18:28.269
...blowing up buildings
with people inside.

18:28.486 --> 18:31.738
It's pretty stupid if the idea
is to save lives, huh?

18:31.950 --> 18:33.742
Exactly.

18:33.953 --> 18:37.074
I marched with Dr. King in the '60s.

18:37.291 --> 18:39.700
I thought the world would learn
something from him.

18:39.879 --> 18:41.042
Yeah.

18:42.132 --> 18:44.672
Would you put your chin up here
for me, please?

18:49.894 --> 18:53.561
Must be hard on you as a doctor,
and of course a young woman...

18:53.734 --> 18:58.694
...to know that for every life you save,
they're taking one away in that clinic.

19:00.368 --> 19:02.327
I don't think about it like that.

19:02.998 --> 19:05.122
I don't think a lot of people do.

19:05.418 --> 19:08.089
It's like that old poem
about the Nazis.

19:08.256 --> 19:10.927
You know. First they came
for the Jews...

19:11.094 --> 19:14.262
...then for whoever, and when they
came to take me-

19:14.432 --> 19:17.007
Doctors who perform abortions
aren't Nazis.

19:17.228 --> 19:18.604
Of course not.

19:18.814 --> 19:23.562
But if you sit around while they're
taking the children, who's next?

19:25.783 --> 19:28.536
All right. I see something in there.

19:28.746 --> 19:30.787
I knew I wasn't crazy.

19:30.958 --> 19:32.453
Hold real still for me.

19:36.007 --> 19:37.716
I got it.

19:39.638 --> 19:41.548
Okay. You're all set.

19:43.936 --> 19:46.559
If you have any discomfort,
you can take some ibuprofen.

19:46.774 --> 19:51.237
Use these drops four times a day.
Come back tomorrow for a re-check.

19:51.448 --> 19:53.240
Thank you.

19:53.451 --> 19:55.076
This is some information
on our group.

19:55.287 --> 19:57.862
We hold strategy meetings
every Wednesday.

19:58.084 --> 19:59.994
- The address is on-
- No, thanks.

20:00.169 --> 20:01.499
Okay.

20:02.339 --> 20:04.000
Oh, can't forget this.

20:04.984 --> 20:06.825
STOP ABORTIONIST GENOCIDE

20:11.771 --> 20:14.524
Hey, Miss Martinez! You forgot this.

20:16.027 --> 20:18.520
- I thought we felt the same.
- No, we don't.

20:18.698 --> 20:20.324
You're not a peaceful protester.

20:20.535 --> 20:23.537
That sign is a call to arms.
The bomber saw it, or one like it.

20:23.748 --> 20:27.368
It's reality. If it upsets you,
then it's done its job.

20:27.587 --> 20:32.548
The only job it's done is to encourage
violence. And, yes, that upsets me.

20:33.388 --> 20:36.924
She was okay before.
She was fine. She was talking.

20:37.143 --> 20:41.013
She had a clot in her lung.
It deprived her brain of oxygen.

20:41.233 --> 20:43.393
There's no way to predict
it would happen.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.602
Are you sure?

20:44.822 --> 20:49.736
We're gonna do an EEG
and a brain scan to confirm it.

20:49.997 --> 20:51.825
So she's in a coma?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.708
It's like a coma, yeah. Yes.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.250
People come out of comas.

20:59.470 --> 21:03.933
Not when the brain has been deprived
of oxygen as long as Zoe's has, no.

21:08.150 --> 21:09.810
What about the baby?

21:12.949 --> 21:14.777
The baby appears to be fine.

21:16.454 --> 21:18.745
Can you save her?

21:18.959 --> 21:21.367
Probably. I think so, yeah.

21:22.464 --> 21:23.959
And it's a girl?

21:25.134 --> 21:26.298
Yes.

21:32.062 --> 21:33.972
You hear that, Zoe?

21:36.152 --> 21:37.647
You were right.

21:38.739 --> 21:40.151
It's a girl.

21:43.329 --> 21:45.822
- Wanted to talk to you before I left.
- Aren't you on till 7?

21:46.042 --> 21:49.329
- No. I've been suspended.
- You're not serious?

21:49.548 --> 21:52.384
- Yeah, well, I wish I wasn't.
- We need help here, now!

21:52.593 --> 21:55.086
I'll call you later, okay?
What have we got?

21:55.306 --> 21:59.258
She's my trainee. She got crushed
underneath some unstable debris.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.351
- We took care of all the traumas.
- People were trapped underneath.

22:02.526 --> 22:06.941
BP 60 palp. Pulse 150 and thready.
IV's infiltrated, poor cap refill.

22:07.158 --> 22:09.318
- Dr. Corday?
- Oh, my God! Allison!

22:09.536 --> 22:12.539
- Clear Trauma 1! EBL on scene?
- Half a liter.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.542
Hope you didn't mess up
my beautiful graft.

22:14.753 --> 22:17.375
- We need X-ray in here now.
- Blood bank on their way.

22:18.801 --> 22:23.050
A 48-year-old custodian.
Multiple lacs to the chest and back.

22:23.224 --> 22:25.384
BP's 70/30. Pulse thready at 144.

22:25.603 --> 22:26.884
Sir, are you with us?

22:27.105 --> 22:28.435
- Peter?
- I'm on my way home.

22:28.650 --> 22:31.522
- Very funny.
- I'm not joking. I've been suspended.

22:31.738 --> 22:33.862
Not by me you haven't. I need you!

22:36.203 --> 22:37.235
All right.

22:37.413 --> 22:41.676
Let's get 6 shooters O-neg. Call
the trauma team, we're on our way.

22:43.894 --> 22:45.685
All right, let's roll him.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.974
Open pneumothorax. Let's tube him.

22:48.191 --> 22:49.900
Damn it. We got a pumper!

22:50.110 --> 22:52.567
- No pulse!
- All right. Start CPR.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.405
We need to crack him.
Thoracotomy tray.

22:54.616 --> 22:56.573
- Cricoid pressure?
- Here's your 10 blade.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.736
A 7.5 ET tube. Let's go.

23:00.874 --> 23:02.533
- Suction.
- There it is.

23:02.751 --> 23:05.242
Dramatic aortic dissection
and rupture.

23:05.462 --> 23:07.122
I'm in! Hyperventilate him.

23:07.339 --> 23:08.454
Can you get the Satinsky in?

23:08.674 --> 23:11.083
No. I'm sticking my finger in.

23:11.261 --> 23:13.052
Don't let go.
You stopped the bleeding.

23:13.930 --> 23:16.173
- I'm holding CPR. Carotid pulse?
- Faint.

23:17.769 --> 23:19.761
Pump in more O-neg.
Get him upstairs.

23:19.938 --> 23:22.560
Malik, you stay with us.
Keep bagging him.

23:22.775 --> 23:25.610
Let's go, people!
Go, go, go!

23:27.238 --> 23:28.781
Alert the bypass team.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.942
You set the pace.
We're following you.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.823
Watch that IV. Call the O.R.,
tell them we're coming!

23:34.038 --> 23:35.533
Dr. Benton, I thought
you understood-

23:35.749 --> 23:38.038
Not now.
He's tamponing an aortic tear.

23:38.252 --> 23:41.039
- Don't jostle the gurney.
- Carry on.

23:41.255 --> 23:43.581
All right, hit five.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.471
- We need four units O-neg.
- What's up, Lizzie?

23:46.638 --> 23:48.963
Decreased breath,
hyper-resonant, hemopneumo.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.599
I got the chest tube.

23:51.101 --> 23:52.430
Can we give her morphine?

23:52.644 --> 23:55.397
- Check the BP first.
- It hurts!

23:55.606 --> 23:57.599
You've got rib fractures.
Try not to talk.

23:57.817 --> 24:00.060
Where have I heard that before?

24:00.613 --> 24:01.858
Thora-Seal's filling.

24:02.072 --> 24:03.317
We need an abdominal CT.

24:03.532 --> 24:05.407
She's unstable.
Do a peritoneal lavage.

24:05.618 --> 24:06.899
Type and cross for eight.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.956
Pulse ox is down, 90.
Here's the O-neg.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.494
You want me to do it?

24:11.709 --> 24:13.998
No. You do it.

24:14.170 --> 24:15.499
Okay.

24:26.018 --> 24:27.217
Hey...

24:28.229 --> 24:31.184
Hi. I'm sorry to wake you up.

24:31.399 --> 24:33.025
I was just resting my eyes.

24:33.194 --> 24:37.358
I brought you juice and a sandwich.
I figured you'd be hungry.

24:37.574 --> 24:38.819
Thanks.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.369
You feeling okay?

24:41.537 --> 24:45.582
Fine, considering.
Were you my doctor?

24:45.792 --> 24:48.794
No. That was Dr. Weaver.

24:49.004 --> 24:51.128
Two docs, no waiting, huh?

24:52.508 --> 24:55.380
My boyfriend brought my clothes.
I'll give you your bed back.

24:55.554 --> 24:58.555
- Are you feeling well enough to go?
- Like I said, I'm fine.

24:58.725 --> 25:03.054
I'd just rather be at home. If you
don't mind, I'm gonna get changed.

25:03.272 --> 25:05.395
Okay. Sure.

25:06.818 --> 25:07.980
Sorry.

25:11.406 --> 25:12.866
Doctor?

25:14.702 --> 25:17.408
Hi, Mr. Newton. How are you feeling?

25:17.581 --> 25:18.910
I'm tired.

25:19.083 --> 25:22.535
That's from the dehydration.
Malnutrition, mostly.

25:22.754 --> 25:26.419
Where... Where's...
Where's Burke?

25:26.591 --> 25:27.920
He left.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.843
He deals with the paperwork.

25:32.057 --> 25:34.097
Your son is no longer your guardian.

25:35.603 --> 25:38.059
For the time being, I am.

25:38.690 --> 25:41.264
Why? What?

25:41.444 --> 25:45.607
The elder abuse unit is filing
paperwork to put you into a home.

25:46.908 --> 25:50.278
But I have a home.

25:50.621 --> 25:52.828
You have some very serious
medical problems...

25:53.041 --> 25:57.086
...resulting from what we believe
is very serious neglect.

25:57.296 --> 26:00.048
I'm 86 years old.

26:01.009 --> 26:04.212
I've slept in the same bed...

26:05.138 --> 26:06.419
...for 70 years now.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.891
I'm just trying to help you.

26:13.816 --> 26:18.360
I want to die in my own bed.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.742
You're not sterile. Go scrub.

26:22.952 --> 26:26.120
I'm not letting go. Get 10 units
packed cells. Let's move.

26:26.331 --> 26:29.997
Okay, people,
on my count. One, two, three.

26:30.211 --> 26:32.999
Move this gurney.
Mark, help me roll him.

26:35.759 --> 26:36.790
Open the instrument tray.

26:36.969 --> 26:39.009
- No one's gloved and gowned.
- Just do it.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.885
Get gloves, gowns, masks
and caps in here now.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.853
- Okay, 10 blade.
- Get him a mask.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.681
Tonsil sucker.

26:46.898 --> 26:50.018
All right. I'm gonna mobilize
the aorta. Metz!

26:50.611 --> 26:53.528
- Let's move, let's move. Come on.
- What's going on?

26:53.698 --> 26:55.856
Peter's got his hand on
this man's aorta.

26:56.075 --> 26:58.532
Potts' clamp.
I'll do a revised clamp-and-run.

27:00.748 --> 27:02.029
Got a second Potts?

27:03.876 --> 27:05.157
Stand by.

27:06.171 --> 27:07.831
Got it.
Take your finger out now.

27:09.384 --> 27:12.135
- Set up the Bovie.
- Pulse is stronger.

27:12.345 --> 27:14.385
Okay, let's go for a BP.

27:14.598 --> 27:16.637
3.0 Prolene on a vascular needle.
Here we go.

27:16.850 --> 27:18.393
Suction, please.
Somebody Hoover that.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.726
Systolic's up to 80.

27:20.897 --> 27:23.472
Terrific.
Okay, we can take over now.

27:24.193 --> 27:25.818
Bovie, please.

27:29.574 --> 27:31.235
A 30, please. Keep them coming.

27:31.410 --> 27:36.287
Retractor and Bovie. Four-by-four
and a sponge stick, please.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.031
Cut that.

27:38.252 --> 27:39.830
Good, good, good.

27:40.046 --> 27:44.424
A 30, keep them coming.
It's looking very good, very good.

27:50.975 --> 27:54.559
- Oh, sweet Jesus!
- There's gotta be another test.

27:55.148 --> 27:58.434
- My angel, sweetheart.
- What's he doing here?

27:58.652 --> 28:01.024
- He was with her during the bombing.
- I bet he was.

28:01.237 --> 28:03.563
- We were getting a checkup.
- You killed my daughter.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.028
Proud of yourself?

28:05.952 --> 28:08.740
If she'd stayed with you,
she would've killed herself.

28:08.956 --> 28:10.119
Calm down.

28:10.333 --> 28:13.084
He needs to get the hell out of
my daughter's room.

28:13.294 --> 28:14.955
I love her.

28:15.714 --> 28:17.872
You guys treated her like crap.

28:18.092 --> 28:20.417
We're calling an OB consult.
Come with me.

28:20.637 --> 28:24.137
Give them some time alone.
All right? Come on.

28:24.308 --> 28:25.885
Here we go. Come on.

28:36.697 --> 28:38.821
She's been in asystole for 20 minutes.

28:39.034 --> 28:41.608
- Another 7 of epi.
- You already had 10.

28:41.829 --> 28:44.499
- We got a response.
- Two beats is not a response.

28:44.665 --> 28:48.000
- Start an epinephrine drip.
- And a heart transplant too?

28:48.169 --> 28:52.085
Stop being such a prick.
Get me two units of packed cells!

28:54.010 --> 28:56.846
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yes.

28:57.056 --> 28:59.464
I wanted to say thanks
for all you did.

29:00.226 --> 29:01.507
The abortion and all.

29:01.728 --> 29:03.352
Right. You're welcome.

29:03.689 --> 29:06.014
It's the most memorable one
I ever got.

29:06.526 --> 29:08.982
- You've had others?
- A few.

29:09.779 --> 29:11.856
I thought Earl would want this baby.

29:12.074 --> 29:15.408
Like he'd get serious about us,
but he hit the roof.

29:15.620 --> 29:18.491
Our clinic can advise you on
family planning.

29:18.707 --> 29:21.115
Earl doesn't like that stuff.
Pills make me fat.

29:21.335 --> 29:24.455
There are preferable forms of
birth control than abortion.

29:24.672 --> 29:26.132
Why are you being such a bitch?

29:26.592 --> 29:28.549
Because you're being irresponsible.

29:28.761 --> 29:31.050
More likely, it's because you
don't get any yourself.

29:33.850 --> 29:35.131
It's a very difficult decision.

29:35.352 --> 29:37.760
Neither of which will bring Zoe back.

29:37.980 --> 29:41.184
It's true. But if the decision is
to keep the baby...

29:41.401 --> 29:45.400
...you have two options: The first is
we perform an emergency C-section.

29:45.614 --> 29:50.029
We deliver a very premature baby,
and we take Zoe off the respirator.

29:51.330 --> 29:54.248
The baby would have to go in
an incubator, right?

29:54.417 --> 29:58.167
That's right. Probably months of
intensive care.

29:58.922 --> 29:59.954
What's the other option?

30:00.174 --> 30:02.880
The other option is that we
keep Zoe on life support...

30:03.095 --> 30:05.420
...until we can deliver
the baby full-term.

30:07.266 --> 30:08.844
And what do you recommend?

30:09.059 --> 30:11.100
I recommend the later delivery.

30:13.232 --> 30:15.984
You're suggesting that our daughter...

30:16.736 --> 30:19.228
...be made into a human incubator.

30:19.448 --> 30:22.402
Even though she has no
chance of recovery.

30:22.618 --> 30:24.113
It's the baby's best chance.

30:24.286 --> 30:28.949
I don't want to see Zoe left lying
there like some kind of vessel.

30:30.252 --> 30:33.123
She wanted this baby more
than anything in the world.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.456
You have no say in this matter.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.129
I'm the baby's father.

30:37.344 --> 30:40.346
I'm Zoe's father,
and you and she are minors.

30:40.557 --> 30:42.633
The decision...

30:42.851 --> 30:44.309
...is mine and her mother's.

30:44.979 --> 30:47.137
They can't do this, can they?

30:51.611 --> 30:53.734
I'm sorry it took us so long
to get to you.

30:53.947 --> 30:56.700
I understand.
I was just really freaked out.

30:56.910 --> 30:59.579
It's not every day the room
you're in explodes.

30:59.788 --> 31:02.540
Understandable. Okay. You're all set.

31:02.750 --> 31:06.084
Keep it elevated and dry, and come
back in two days for a re-check.

31:06.296 --> 31:07.459
- Okay?
- Yeah.

31:07.672 --> 31:09.666
You left your insurance form blank.

31:09.884 --> 31:12.007
Yeah. I left my card at home.

31:12.220 --> 31:15.387
- Can you call someone to get it?
- No, I'll pay cash.

31:15.599 --> 31:17.508
That's not necessary.
Your insurance will cover this.

31:17.685 --> 31:19.180
No, I know.
I just...

31:19.395 --> 31:22.765
...don't want my husband to know
I was at the clinic.

31:24.401 --> 31:28.186
I thought I was too old for
this kind of thing to happen.

31:28.406 --> 31:31.573
Then I started to puke up
corn flakes every morning.

31:31.785 --> 31:35.535
Now I have to find a new clinic.
Preferably one that is not ticking.

31:35.749 --> 31:38.370
- You haven't had the abortion?
- No.

31:38.877 --> 31:42.329
And if my husband finds out,
he just won't have the heart.

31:42.549 --> 31:46.168
Our youngest daughter's in college.
He put all four kids through college.

31:46.386 --> 31:48.842
He worked five years
past his retirement...

31:49.056 --> 31:50.800
...to be able to pay for it.

31:52.393 --> 31:54.517
I've never kept anything
from him, but-

31:54.729 --> 31:56.557
What if you told him
what you told me?

31:56.774 --> 31:58.684
I can't. I'd love to...

32:00.153 --> 32:01.565
...but I can't.

32:03.073 --> 32:04.734
Anyway, what do I owe you?

32:04.909 --> 32:07.068
Don't worry.
Bring your card tomorrow.

32:07.245 --> 32:10.116
I could leave a license
or something as collateral.

32:10.332 --> 32:13.251
- It's all right. I trust you.
- Thanks.

32:13.419 --> 32:15.543
If anybody asks...

32:16.548 --> 32:19.585
...you can get a laceration
like that from a dog bite.

32:24.432 --> 32:25.678
Have you seen Corday?

32:25.893 --> 32:27.850
She's still in O.R. 3
with Beaumont.

32:28.062 --> 32:29.260
Okay, thanks.

32:36.947 --> 32:38.526
She made it, huh?

32:40.452 --> 32:42.160
What's wrong? You okay?

32:42.996 --> 32:44.456
Yeah.

32:46.208 --> 32:47.917
It was scary.

32:49.421 --> 32:53.669
You can put them back together,
but you can't keep them that way.

33:04.314 --> 33:08.644
Scotty always had such
great school spirit.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.905
I think I can speak for
the whole team when I say...

33:13.117 --> 33:15.193
...we're really going to miss him.

33:23.045 --> 33:25.003
I was gonna sing a hymn.

33:25.841 --> 33:28.877
But as I'm sitting here,
thinking of Scott...

33:29.345 --> 33:31.468
...there's a song that he loved.

33:32.056 --> 33:34.512
And it'll always remind me of him.

34:05.639 --> 34:08.510
Zadro, I fancy seeing you
on the surgical floor.

34:08.684 --> 34:11.851
I wanted to tell you, we appreciate
what you did for Allison.

34:12.021 --> 34:13.431
She's a fighter.

34:13.649 --> 34:15.806
With a damn good guardian angel.

34:18.321 --> 34:19.351
Lizzie...

34:19.572 --> 34:23.949
...I want to apologize for when I
spoke during the Beaumont surgery.

34:24.161 --> 34:28.242
I know that she means a lot to you.
I just hope you forgive me.

34:28.458 --> 34:32.206
Of course. It's been
a crazy day for all of us.

34:32.380 --> 34:34.206
I get off in about an hour.

34:34.382 --> 34:37.716
Do you want to get a drink?
Decompress?

34:38.344 --> 34:42.214
Look, I'm knackered.
Any other day. Okay?

34:42.433 --> 34:45.268
I understand. If you change your
mind, you have my number.

34:45.478 --> 34:46.808
Yes, I do.

34:51.902 --> 34:52.982
David?

34:54.572 --> 34:56.649
I forgot what this place
was all about.

34:56.868 --> 35:00.071
The teamwork.
The well-oiled machine.

35:00.288 --> 35:01.320
What?

35:03.792 --> 35:07.412
I've let this situation get
completely out of hand.

35:09.049 --> 35:11.719
I told myself the varices
were too friable.

35:11.927 --> 35:13.921
That my field was obscured.

35:14.138 --> 35:18.636
That I was protecting
Dr. Swanson's dignity. I wasn't.

35:19.270 --> 35:21.179
I was covering my own ass.

35:22.983 --> 35:26.566
Look, if you make a mistake,
that's all that it is.

35:26.779 --> 35:28.938
No. No.

35:29.115 --> 35:30.989
It's more than that.

35:31.201 --> 35:32.861
What are you watching?

35:35.456 --> 35:38.826
What am I not watching?
That's the question.

35:40.962 --> 35:43.288
This is the tape of Swanson's
laparoscopy.

35:43.507 --> 35:44.919
Where did you get it?

35:45.135 --> 35:48.670
I took it right after the surgery.

35:49.264 --> 35:51.637
I've been too chicken to look at it.

35:53.269 --> 35:56.935
I guess I thought we could
avoid a confrontation.

35:57.149 --> 36:00.151
A resident can take a note
in his file, right?

36:00.361 --> 36:03.150
Peter's got so much less
to lose than-

36:06.244 --> 36:08.153
I can toss this right now.

36:08.329 --> 36:10.405
No one would be the wiser.

36:11.041 --> 36:14.292
You wouldn't have called me if
that's what you were going to do.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.238
Jeanie?

36:38.032 --> 36:40.109
I wondered where you'd gotten to.

36:40.327 --> 36:43.411
I'm just sitting in here.
It's very peaceful.

36:44.540 --> 36:46.865
Yes, it is.

36:48.336 --> 36:52.714
When Scotty was going through
the worst of it...

36:53.384 --> 36:57.465
...I went into his room.
Found his journal.

36:59.392 --> 37:01.848
I know I shouldn't have
looked at it...

37:03.062 --> 37:05.684
...but I wanted to understand him...

37:06.692 --> 37:10.525
...the way you and his mother
seemed to.

37:10.739 --> 37:12.150
He loved you very much.

37:16.579 --> 37:20.245
He said, "Jeanie just gets it.

37:20.459 --> 37:25.417
I don't have to explain anything to her,
because she already knows. "

37:27.593 --> 37:29.336
That's very sweet.

37:30.930 --> 37:33.931
He told me what he wanted to be
when he grew up.

37:35.519 --> 37:38.603
Some kind of rock 'n' roll star,
probably.

37:39.899 --> 37:41.691
He wanted to join the Army.

37:45.114 --> 37:46.395
He did?

38:00.799 --> 38:04.299
I paged OB. They'll send somebody
to discuss your options.

38:04.470 --> 38:09.217
We've decided to keep the baby
and wait until it's closer to term.

38:10.311 --> 38:12.350
Good, I'm glad.
Donny will be glad too.

38:12.563 --> 38:15.316
This is no longer
any of Donny's business.

38:17.236 --> 38:18.778
Give it a little more time.

38:18.988 --> 38:23.485
I've contacted our attorney. My wife
and I are filing for sole custody.

38:24.912 --> 38:27.154
Is this to teach Donny a lesson?

38:27.665 --> 38:29.659
Nothing could teach him
what he deserves.

38:29.876 --> 38:31.454
I've seen parents twice his age...

38:31.670 --> 38:34.078
...who weren't responsible
enough to seek care.

38:34.299 --> 38:37.918
Responsible? Getting
a 16-year-old girl pregnant.

38:38.136 --> 38:40.094
Forcing her to leave home.
Drop out of school-

38:40.306 --> 38:41.385
- Please, Miles.
- No.

38:41.558 --> 38:45.306
- The doctor thinks he's an expert.
- No, it's just-

38:46.479 --> 38:49.018
It's just what's best for the child.

38:49.191 --> 38:52.192
We let Donny into our lives once
and he took our daughter away.

38:52.403 --> 38:54.812
He's not gonna
take our granddaughter.

38:57.493 --> 38:59.782
- I don't want to go.
- Everything will be fine.

38:59.996 --> 39:01.538
This is for the best.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.035
I'm not sure it is.

39:03.250 --> 39:06.204
You filed a legal report.
You can't rescind that.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.213
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

39:08.423 --> 39:10.297
If you won't listen to me,
listen to him.

39:10.509 --> 39:14.211
Someone being abused can't always
determine the best course of action.

39:14.389 --> 39:16.049
This isn't a hypothetical.

39:16.224 --> 39:19.261
This is an adult human being who's
deciding to go home.

39:19.478 --> 39:22.052
Your report said he was
non compos mentis.

39:22.232 --> 39:23.560
He was severely dehydrated.

39:23.734 --> 39:26.059
Once we ran fluids in him,
he's become lucid.

39:26.278 --> 39:27.986
Mr. Newton, I know you're scared.

39:28.197 --> 39:31.448
But I'm scared about what's going to
happen to you if you're not cared for.

39:31.660 --> 39:35.990
I'm fine. Dr. Carter,
call Burke. He'll explain.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.580
Don't force me to get
the police involved...

39:38.752 --> 39:42.086
...and press charges against your
son and daughter-in-law.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.371
Can she do that?

39:44.383 --> 39:47.587
- Please don't let her do that.
- I'm sorry.

39:47.804 --> 39:49.429
Don't let her do that!

39:49.681 --> 39:51.722
- I'm sorry!
- I want to go home!

39:53.937 --> 39:55.266
Kerry.

39:55.772 --> 39:57.017
Anna.

39:57.232 --> 40:00.150
What happened today, it threw me.
It's been on my mind.

40:00.361 --> 40:02.935
- I wanted to talk to you about it.
- Same here.

40:03.114 --> 40:07.065
I should have explained myself better
instead of flying off the handle.

40:07.286 --> 40:09.824
- You were right.
- No, just let me explain.

40:11.208 --> 40:15.870
I did some overseas work in Africa
where abortion is illegal.

40:16.089 --> 40:20.633
And I saw 15-year-old girls
in septic shock...

40:20.803 --> 40:22.961
...from botched procedures.

40:23.181 --> 40:25.553
And there was nothing we could do.

40:25.767 --> 40:29.219
I've made it a priority to be
the best doctor I can be...

40:29.439 --> 40:31.764
...and to support all
my patients' choices.

40:31.982 --> 40:34.605
If you had asked me when I
got up this morning...

40:34.820 --> 40:36.527
...I would've said the same thing.

40:36.738 --> 40:38.483
But in this case,
she was so far along.

40:38.866 --> 40:41.654
What if another Brianna Thomas
comes in?

40:43.997 --> 40:48.541
I'd love to be able to tell you that
if the same case came in tomorrow...

40:48.753 --> 40:52.704
...I'd do the procedure without
a second thought, but I don't know.

41:00.183 --> 41:04.016
Peter, I'm glad I caught you.
I was on my way to your apartment.

41:04.189 --> 41:07.392
I'm sorry about that surgery,
but I already had my hand in there.

41:07.609 --> 41:09.188
No, you did the right thing.

41:09.403 --> 41:13.104
You were thinking on your feet.
That's not what I want to talk about.

41:13.325 --> 41:17.538
I wanted to let you know that one of my
last two acts as Chief of Surgery...

41:17.705 --> 41:19.532
...is to rescind your suspension.

41:21.167 --> 41:22.365
What do you mean?

41:23.963 --> 41:27.332
That's Swanson's laparoscopy
in full living color.

41:27.550 --> 41:29.460
The mistake wasn't yours.

41:29.678 --> 41:32.086
I cut the gastric artery.

41:32.557 --> 41:36.009
My last act as chief will be to resign.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.638
- It was just one incident.
- No.

41:42.819 --> 41:47.113
When I saw you in that trauma today,
the passion that you exhibited...

41:47.324 --> 41:49.946
...it's been years since I felt that.

41:50.161 --> 41:54.029
It might have something to do with
my heart attack. The pressure...

41:54.249 --> 41:57.619
...of feeling that I just
don't belong here anymore.

41:59.089 --> 42:01.759
What do you mean?
You're a great surgeon.

42:02.426 --> 42:04.466
You taught me everything I know.

42:05.679 --> 42:08.931
I was a great surgeon.
But what happened...

42:09.101 --> 42:11.058
...what I allowed to happen...

42:11.270 --> 42:13.940
...it just proves that I'm not
a very great man.

42:14.107 --> 42:16.432
That's what I gotta work on.

42:22.158 --> 42:23.190
Here.

42:24.328 --> 42:26.654
- You smell that?
- What's that?

42:26.872 --> 42:29.032
The smell of spring.

42:29.793 --> 42:32.960
All green, and full of possibility.

42:36.134 --> 42:38.707
Ramen Delight. You feeling suicidal?

42:38.929 --> 42:41.467
No, I'm just poor.

42:41.682 --> 42:43.591
John Truman Carter, poor?

42:43.810 --> 42:47.974
It's a long story.
I've had a bit of a long week.

42:49.107 --> 42:53.153
I overdid it with a patient.
Thought I was doing what was best.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.572
Better to overdo it and be wrong,
than not do anything at all.

42:56.784 --> 42:58.113
I'll tell you what.

42:58.328 --> 43:02.112
Dump that liquid sodium
and I'll buy you a burger and a beer.

43:02.332 --> 43:05.038
- I don't know.
- Come on. It's not an option.

43:05.253 --> 43:06.746
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jeanie.

43:06.962 --> 43:08.161
Is it still raining?

43:08.339 --> 43:11.340
It's not so bad.
It's kind of nice, actually.

43:23.316 --> 43:24.347
Peter?

43:24.567 --> 43:26.809
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

43:27.697 --> 43:29.986
Come on in.
I'll turn the music down.

43:40.504 --> 43:42.994
- Let me take that.
- Oh...

43:43.215 --> 43:45.007
Here, look, you're soaking wet.

43:45.218 --> 43:47.009
Yeah. Cheap umbrella.

43:47.220 --> 43:49.890
What possessed you to
come out in these elements?

43:50.348 --> 43:53.185
My day, my week, my life.

43:53.811 --> 43:57.228
I heard about Morgenstern.
I'm really sorry.

44:02.196 --> 44:04.604
I lost my mentor today.

44:05.701 --> 44:07.409
And the hospital...

44:09.288 --> 44:11.198
...they lost a great surgeon.

44:20.052 --> 44:22.377
You can be so close to somebody...

44:24.098 --> 44:26.008
...and then they're gone.

44:26.768 --> 44:31.016
And you've never even told them
that you- You know, how...

44:32.608 --> 44:33.984
What you-

44:34.694 --> 44:37.316
I'm sorry, I'm babbling.
I'm not making sense.
