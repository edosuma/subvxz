WEBVTT

00:03.538 --> 00:04.454
Hey, Riley.

00:04.506 --> 00:06.456
(grunts)

00:11.296 --> 00:13.329
Coffee?

00:13.364 --> 00:14.380
Is there something different?

00:14.432 --> 00:16.364
Give me a minute, I'll figure it out.

00:16.418 --> 00:18.684
I've decided that it is a
brand-new day for Riley Perrin.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.587
That's right, when Riley Perrin
takes a punch to the heart,

00:21.623 --> 00:23.539
she doesn't just hit
the mat like a loser.

00:23.575 --> 00:25.675
No, no. Riley Perrin gets
up and she starts fresh,

00:25.710 --> 00:27.460
starting with her living space.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.396
Do you like it? Riley Perrin loves it.

00:30.448 --> 00:33.433
Well, tell Riley Perrin that I
came by to bring her some coffee

00:33.435 --> 00:36.319
and offer my support while she
and Danny work through their...

00:36.354 --> 00:37.437
...issues.

00:37.439 --> 00:40.273
"Issues"? Really?

00:40.308 --> 00:42.708
Is that what he said, that
we're just having some issues.

00:42.744 --> 00:45.678
Oh, okay. Well, if issues means putting
his issue into someone else's issue

00:45.713 --> 00:48.698
and lying about it for seven
years, then yeah, it's an issue.

00:48.733 --> 00:51.501
And I think you've
already had enough of this.

00:51.536 --> 00:52.552
Sorry.

00:52.554 --> 00:55.505
Oh God, I'm just... I'm
not myself right now.

00:55.540 --> 00:57.406
You know what would be so great?

00:57.442 --> 00:59.542
A whole five minutes without
having to think or talk about Danny.

00:59.577 --> 01:01.477
You got it.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.263
Riley, I heard all about you and Danny.

01:04.299 --> 01:08.367
But don't worry. Mother's here,
and everything is going to be okay.

01:08.403 --> 01:12.271
We are going to go over
every heart-wrenching detail,

01:12.323 --> 01:15.558
over and over and over again.

01:15.593 --> 01:18.544
Then we'll talk about some of
your other poor life choices...

01:18.580 --> 01:20.680
like your hair...

01:20.682 --> 01:22.682
and why you're still
hanging out with losers.

01:22.717 --> 01:25.618
Hey, Ben.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.504
Hey, Mrs. Perrin.

Your change. I hope
you enjoyed your lunch.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.573
And please remember for your next visit,

01:47.575 --> 01:49.575
we have several exciting
items off the menu,

01:49.627 --> 01:50.793
but on the Benu.

01:50.828 --> 01:53.579
By the way, I'm Ben.

01:53.631 --> 01:56.666
Aw, you're adorable. Not happening.

01:56.718 --> 01:59.719
- Tucker?
- Giselle. Hey, girl.

01:59.754 --> 02:01.637
Nice to see you.

02:01.673 --> 02:04.557
Thanks for the lunch recommendation.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.592
- See you next week?
- I will be there.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.600
Both: Dibs! I saw her
first! No, I saw her first!

02:14.602 --> 02:15.685
She's mine. All right?

02:15.737 --> 02:17.603
Her name is Giselle, and
I met her over a month ago.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.605
And you're still at "Nice to see you"?

02:19.607 --> 02:21.524
You've passed your sexpiration date.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.576
What? It's kind of tricky. All right?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.578
She works at a clinic
I've been going to,

02:25.613 --> 02:28.531
and I only get a few minutes to
talk to her before my appointment.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.700
A clinic? Man, are you sick?

02:30.752 --> 02:33.619
'Cause I accidentally used
your toothbrush yesterday

02:33.621 --> 02:35.755
I've had a sore throat ever since.

02:35.790 --> 02:38.624
No, man. I'm not sick. All right?

02:38.676 --> 02:40.626
And it's actually more
of a bank than a clinic,

02:40.678 --> 02:43.546
where you make deposits into little cups

02:43.598 --> 02:46.599
and your ATM card is in your pants.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.601
Are you sure you're not sick?

02:48.636 --> 02:49.769
'Cause you kind of
sound like you are to me.

02:49.804 --> 02:52.638
She works at a sperm bank.

02:52.690 --> 02:55.608
I started to go 'cause I
needed a little extra money.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.777
Do you know they pay
almost 200 bucks a deposit?

02:57.812 --> 03:01.614
Oh my God! I'd be a millionaire by now.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.483
Yeah, but they only
let you go once a week.

03:07.538 --> 03:09.538
Wait. Hold up.

03:09.574 --> 03:12.491
I can't go again, but you can.

03:12.543 --> 03:15.594
Yeah, and while you're
there, opening up an account,

03:15.630 --> 03:17.563
I can get some quality
time alone with her.

03:17.615 --> 03:18.614
What do you say?

03:18.649 --> 03:21.600
So you want me to leave
work at peak business hours

03:21.602 --> 03:25.354
to go across town to do something I
can pretty much do anywhere at anytime?

03:25.390 --> 03:27.440
Yeah, you're right. Never mind.

03:27.442 --> 03:29.342
I'll be at the bank!

03:33.414 --> 03:35.381
- (door opens)
- Bonnie: All right!

03:35.416 --> 03:36.732
Who's buying me lunch today?

03:36.768 --> 03:40.653
Eenie-meenie-miney... mo.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.589
Not now, Mom. I'm trying to focus.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.640
Good idea.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.609
Last time you got
distracted doing push-ups,

03:46.677 --> 03:48.677
you broke your nose and we had
to retile the kitchen floor.

03:48.730 --> 03:52.498
No. I'm focusing on not
thinking about Riley.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.518
Sixty-six! Sixty-seven!
Sixty-Riley!

03:55.570 --> 03:57.536
Damn!

03:57.572 --> 03:59.438
Why can't she just forgive me?

03:59.474 --> 04:01.240
I mean, it happened seven years ago,

04:01.292 --> 04:02.475
and more importantly, I didn't lie.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.277
And, of course, his whole
defense is that he didn't lie,

04:05.279 --> 04:07.713
but we all know what I was asking him.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.649
Semantics. It all
comes down to semantics.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.319
Well, let's hope you didn't
use that two-dollar word on him

04:13.354 --> 04:15.654
'cause I'm pretty sure he'll
be about a buck 98 short.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.557
Mom, how can I ever trust him again?

04:18.593 --> 04:21.677
Oh, honey. When it comes to
being a couple, trust takes time.

04:21.712 --> 04:26.649
Time for the woman to realize
you can never trust a man.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.551
And don't worry, honey.

04:28.586 --> 04:31.454
It's easy to win back someone's trust.

04:31.489 --> 04:35.357
What's hard is trying to act like you've
never met him when he's with his wife.

04:36.794 --> 04:38.394
But don't worry.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.446
This will all blow over
once she starts to miss you.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.681
Well, it's going to be
hard for her to miss me

04:42.683 --> 04:45.634
since we're throwing that stupid
engagement party for our stupid friends.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.603
Rhonda and Jeremy. I
mean, we're the ones

04:47.655 --> 04:49.605
who stupidly set them
up in the first place.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.590
Hopefully, after they get
married, they'll move away

04:51.592 --> 04:54.527
so I won't have to see her stupid
cheerful face at work every day.

04:54.529 --> 04:56.579
I mean, it's like, we
get it... you're happy.

04:56.614 --> 04:59.448
Riley, you have to
get ahold of yourself.

04:59.484 --> 05:01.550
I mean, look at you. You've
clearly hit rock bottom.

05:04.455 --> 05:06.505
- But, Mom...
- No. Don't "But, Mom" me.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.275
While I have never been
a fan of the Wheelers...

05:09.277 --> 05:11.260
and please note I just said
"Wheelers" without dry heaving...

05:11.295 --> 05:13.262
somehow, you bagged the good one.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.331
And if you're not going to talk
some sense into him, then I am.

05:15.366 --> 05:17.733
- Mom, no!
- Look, I'm sorry, honey.

05:17.768 --> 05:19.752
But you two belong together,

05:19.787 --> 05:22.721
and I'm not going to
take no for an answer.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.658
(gasps)

05:28.529 --> 05:30.463
Jennifer.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.532
Bonnie.

05:33.568 --> 05:36.469
You know what, Danny? Some
things aren't worth fighting for.

05:36.471 --> 05:39.371
Pumpkin, you're still young,
you'll find someone else.

05:43.494 --> 05:44.727
Here you go.

05:44.762 --> 05:48.414
I wasn't sure, so under "sex,"
I put "as much as I can."

05:48.449 --> 05:50.299
All right.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.651
If you want to come around here,

05:52.703 --> 05:55.621
I can just take a quick picture
for your profile and we'll be done.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.657
If you want to wait until after,
I'll probably be smiling more.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.444
So, you're in room three,

06:02.497 --> 06:04.463
just follow the
instructions posted inside.

06:04.499 --> 06:07.399
Make yourself comfortable and
take advantage of the visual aids.

06:09.387 --> 06:10.336
I'm good.

06:11.522 --> 06:15.307
So, Giselle, that's a beautiful name.

06:15.343 --> 06:16.692
Hold on!

06:20.765 --> 06:22.331
I'm just kidding.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.749
You guys chat. I'll get back to work.

06:25.703 --> 06:28.604
Okay. We'll have everything
set up at the bar by noon.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.655
Can you order the champagne?

06:29.707 --> 06:31.624
Or will that just be
something else you forget

06:31.626 --> 06:33.609
and I'll have to hear
about it seven years later?

06:33.644 --> 06:35.494
Nice shot, honey.

06:35.546 --> 06:37.563
Something Danny's coach has never said.

06:39.584 --> 06:42.484
The champagne will be
ready. You want to know why?

06:42.520 --> 06:44.420
Because you specifically
asked for champagne

06:44.455 --> 06:46.772
and not whether I had
feelings for champagne.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.425
Don't be afraid to take
a shot at the mom too.

06:49.460 --> 06:50.376
Okay.

06:52.697 --> 06:53.746
Do you guys mind?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.614
We're kind of in the
middle of something here.

06:55.650 --> 06:58.651
Yeah, Jennifer. We're trying to
plan an engagement party here.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.637
If you want to help, why don't
you call the party planner

07:01.689 --> 07:04.506
and ask him to fill a
truck of tables and chairs

07:04.559 --> 07:06.525
and then run you over with it.

07:08.479 --> 07:10.429
Mom, please, just stay out of this.

07:10.481 --> 07:12.298
It's already going to be hard enough

07:12.333 --> 07:14.316
with everyone at the party
asking why we broke up.

07:14.352 --> 07:16.285
Which is why we're not telling anyone.

07:16.337 --> 07:18.304
So, bring your happy face. Got it?

07:18.306 --> 07:19.722
Oh. I'll bring three happy faces.

07:19.774 --> 07:21.707
'Cause I'm pretty sure,
you'll make the first two mad.

07:23.311 --> 07:24.677
(phone rings)

07:24.712 --> 07:27.279
Oh God. Oh God, it's Rhonda. Happy face!

07:27.315 --> 07:28.647
Rhonda, hi!

07:28.699 --> 07:30.699
We are so excited about the party.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.551
Aren't we, honey?

07:32.553 --> 07:35.621
We sure are... monkey pants.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.490
Just checking in to make sure
everything is going according to plan.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.575
Couldn't be going better.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.461
Oh my God. You guys are so cute.

07:42.513 --> 07:45.364
I just hope Jeremy and I
are as happy as you two are.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.449
You've really been such
an inspiration to us.

07:47.485 --> 07:49.351
Okay. Bye, guys!

07:50.771 --> 07:54.640
- I should probably...
- Yeah, and I need to get...

07:54.675 --> 07:57.610
Oh my God! Did you see that?

07:57.612 --> 07:59.762
Rhonda's hair? Whoa!

07:59.797 --> 08:03.582
No. Danny and Riley. They're
so caught up in fighting,

08:03.634 --> 08:05.618
they can't see how much
love that is still there.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.554
Yeah. I don't know where
they get their tempers.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.373
(phone rings)

08:11.409 --> 08:13.409
(shouts) Stop calling me!

08:14.478 --> 08:16.278
My mother.

08:17.348 --> 08:19.732
If we could just get
them to have a moment,

08:19.767 --> 08:21.717
maybe they could build on that

08:21.786 --> 08:24.303
and start forgetting
why they hate each other.

08:24.305 --> 08:26.238
Oh my God. You're right.

08:26.290 --> 08:27.706
We need to work together.

08:27.742 --> 08:29.692
We have to be a team.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.698
Yeah. We're a real Thelma and Hitler.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.419
To be clear, you're Hitler.

08:44.575 --> 08:46.525
Done. And I believe that was

08:46.560 --> 08:49.361
my favorite visit to the
doctor's office, ever.

08:49.413 --> 08:51.397
Actually, that's not true.

08:51.432 --> 08:53.432
Dude! Dude, it worked.

08:53.434 --> 08:55.367
Giselle and I are
getting together later.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.719
Hey, I don't know how it would come up,

08:56.771 --> 08:59.621
but if you ever need me to
do that for you, I'm there.

09:01.676 --> 09:04.593
Wait, dude. I think that
couple is picking a donor.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.512
- What if they pick me?
- Come on.

09:06.514 --> 09:08.147
Do you really think
anybody's going to pick

09:08.173 --> 09:09.656
you over the hundreds
of other choices?

09:09.684 --> 09:12.501
Come on, man. I'm in there too.

09:12.536 --> 09:14.303
All right. That's true.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.290
It was hard, but I
think we made a decision.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.425
- Right, honey.
- We did.

09:19.477 --> 09:24.329
We'd like donor 4-11-17
to help us become a family.

09:32.021 --> 09:34.338
Sorry, I'm late. Work was crazy.

09:34.373 --> 09:37.258
Is it wrong I don't want
to hear about your day?

09:37.293 --> 09:39.226
Oh, but one fun thing happened.

09:39.262 --> 09:40.361
And I'm hearing about it anyway.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.297
Your friend, Ben, he got picked.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.232
He was barely out the front door.

09:45.234 --> 09:48.185
But don't tell him, it's
totally against policy.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.071
Oh my God. No, yeah. Hey, hey...

09:51.073 --> 09:53.224
I would never betray your trust.

09:53.276 --> 09:56.043
Would you excuse me for a moment?

09:59.115 --> 10:01.048
Ben, you're going to be a father.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.233
What?

10:02.268 --> 10:04.452
Yeah, Ben. Giselle just told
me that a couple picked you.

10:04.454 --> 10:06.420
Tucker, you said I wouldn't get picked.

10:06.422 --> 10:08.439
Yeah, well, I didn't
realize there'd be a run

10:08.491 --> 10:11.292
on single-father,
college-dropout sperm.

10:11.327 --> 10:14.245
I might've embellished
my profile a little.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.264
Harvard med student, Olympic
athlete who plays the drums?

10:17.300 --> 10:20.134
Damn it! Even I want to
have a kid with that guy.

10:20.136 --> 10:22.153
You know what? Don't
worry about it, okay?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.237
This is not even a big deal.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.108
Hey, Ben. I'm putting this
case of champagne in the walk-in

10:28.144 --> 10:30.027
for that stupid engagement party.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.178
Didn't you just put one in there?

10:31.214 --> 10:33.113
Yeah. This one's for Mom.

10:33.115 --> 10:35.432
Danny, can I ask you a quick question?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.451
You ever think about
donating your sperm?

10:37.453 --> 10:39.520
Oh my God. Why would you say that?

10:39.555 --> 10:42.339
You think things are never
going to work out with Riley?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.308
You think I'm never
going to meet someone?

10:44.343 --> 10:46.327
You think I'll never
be able to have kids?

10:46.329 --> 10:49.180
No! No. No. I just donated

10:49.232 --> 10:51.198
and I'm kind of having
some second thoughts.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.100
Well, you should.

10:53.102 --> 10:55.085
I can't believe you of all
people, who's got Emily,

10:55.121 --> 10:57.121
would be willing to bring
another kid into the world.

10:57.173 --> 10:59.106
Not knowing who the
parents are going to be

10:59.158 --> 11:01.125
or how they're going
to raise your child.

11:01.177 --> 11:03.093
Just hope nobody picks you, man.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.447
Wow. I was kind of hoping
this would be one of those,

11:06.482 --> 11:08.399
"Hey, little bro. Don't
worry about it" moments.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.251
Anytime, man.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.256
- This is nice, isn't it?
- Mm.

11:15.258 --> 11:19.293
Celebrating young love that's embracing
all their differences to become one.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.345
Nothing makes me happier.

11:21.397 --> 11:23.280
(laughs loudly)

11:23.316 --> 11:25.199
It's so true, Jennifer.

11:25.234 --> 11:29.069
Only that sweater you're
wearing makes me happier.

11:29.071 --> 11:31.188
I just love how it hides everything.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.157
Thank you.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.126
Danny, why don't you hold that ladder
for Riley so she doesn't get hurt.

11:36.178 --> 11:39.113
Oh okay. Because I'm a girl and
I can't do anything by myself?

11:39.148 --> 11:41.398
No, because you might fall.

11:41.484 --> 11:42.349
Oh!

11:44.503 --> 11:46.270
Thank you.

11:46.305 --> 11:47.404
Anytime.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.373
Aw!

11:49.425 --> 11:52.276
This just reminds me of you
guys up in that old tree house.

11:52.311 --> 11:57.214
You two would just spend hours up
there, just giggling and gossiping.

11:57.266 --> 11:59.233
Yeah, that old tree house.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.168
Spent a fortune on her broken wrist,

12:01.220 --> 12:03.053
but you can't put a
price on their happiness.

12:03.105 --> 12:04.121
Twelve-hundred dollars.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.991
Well, when that much weight falls,

12:07.026 --> 12:08.475
something's going to shatter,

12:08.477 --> 12:11.045
including a brand-new lounge chair.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.429
Forty-nine dollars.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.382
And isn't it ironic that
those stairs were so rickety,

12:15.418 --> 12:18.018
considering the man of the
house was a supposed contractor?

12:18.020 --> 12:21.255
Oh, that's right. He was actually
sleeping with the contractor.

12:21.257 --> 12:23.240
Aha! For your information,

12:23.276 --> 12:25.292
he was sleeping with the gardener!

12:26.412 --> 12:28.329
Well, I see where you get it.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.098
Where I get it? More
like where you get it.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.133
- Oh, nice comeback.
- Oh, your mom.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.169
Now see what you've done?

12:35.204 --> 12:37.204
I'm just going to go take
this into the walk-in.

12:37.239 --> 12:39.089
No, I'll take it, since
I'm not sure you know

12:39.141 --> 12:41.075
this is just a punch bowl and
not just a really big glass.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.377
I've got two words for you: nose job!

12:43.379 --> 12:44.428
Hey, hey, hey! Put it down!

12:44.463 --> 12:46.330
You two are acting like children!

12:46.365 --> 12:47.448
(shrieks)

12:49.402 --> 12:51.251
(huffs)

12:53.389 --> 12:57.141
Hey. Why don't you wring
that out right in here?

13:01.147 --> 13:03.230
Ah. The Old Woman in the Shoe.

13:03.232 --> 13:05.165
It's a good one.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.017
Speaking of too many kids,

13:07.069 --> 13:09.453
I may have just made one of
the biggest mistakes of my life.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.439
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it'll be fine.

13:12.441 --> 13:15.426
(older voice) Fine? Let's
see how fine you think it is

13:15.478 --> 13:18.312
when I grow up and accidentally
date my own brother.

13:18.347 --> 13:20.314
Nice going, Dad.

13:20.349 --> 13:21.448
(gasps)

13:21.450 --> 13:23.267
Hi.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.286
Tucker! We got to get my boys back!

13:32.916 --> 13:35.783
I've invested a lot into
making this relationship work.

13:35.835 --> 13:38.052
I have never been so dehydrated.

13:38.138 --> 13:40.655
Giselle. Hey, me again.

13:40.707 --> 13:42.207
Look, I'm really sorry to bother you,

13:42.209 --> 13:45.677
but I kind of left a little something
here yesterday that I'd like to get back.

13:45.712 --> 13:48.046
Oh, that's okay. It
happens all the time.

13:48.048 --> 13:50.031
Really? Oh, wow. Thank you.

13:51.117 --> 13:55.937
Uh... I was actually
talking about my sample.

13:55.989 --> 13:59.757
I forgot I already promised
it to somebody else.

13:59.793 --> 14:02.844
I'm sorry, but you relinquished all
rights when you signed the contract.

14:02.879 --> 14:05.863
Yeah, um, what if you
happen to lose that contract?

14:05.865 --> 14:09.651
Then I lose my job and you lose a date.

14:10.704 --> 14:12.720
You signed a contract, man. I...

14:12.772 --> 14:15.106
I'm sorry, but I have
to get back to work.

14:15.108 --> 14:16.958
Mr. and Mrs. Miller?

14:21.031 --> 14:23.097
Oh my God. That's the couple
that was here yesterday.

14:23.149 --> 14:25.984
Dude, I bet you that's
the couple that...

14:27.887 --> 14:28.920
Ben?

14:30.000 --> 14:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:39.816 --> 14:42.700
Yeah. I can really see
us growing old together.

14:42.736 --> 14:45.053
It's almost like I
can't wait till we die.

14:48.091 --> 14:50.108
Enjoying the free show?

14:50.110 --> 14:51.960
Speed it up, kid. Okay?

14:51.995 --> 14:53.044
You're welcome.

14:53.096 --> 14:54.979
Oh good. Are we going to make a toast?

14:55.031 --> 14:57.065
No. I'm going to make a toast.

14:57.117 --> 14:59.984
You are going to stand there
slack-jawed and make me look good.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.954
I'm gonna remind Danny and Riley
how much they love each other.

15:02.956 --> 15:04.889
(clears throat) Everyone!

15:04.924 --> 15:08.793
I'd like us all to raise a glass to...

15:09.829 --> 15:12.897
him and... that girl!

15:12.899 --> 15:14.882
But more importantly,

15:14.918 --> 15:19.737
to Danny and Riley whose own
love brought them together.

15:20.807 --> 15:23.624
And we should all
remember that we're here

15:23.660 --> 15:25.643
because of Danny and Riley.

15:25.679 --> 15:27.712
That's exactly what I just said.

15:27.747 --> 15:28.946
Well, I...

15:28.999 --> 15:31.049
And here's a little advice.

15:31.051 --> 15:33.651
Never go to bed angry...

15:33.687 --> 15:37.889
even if your partner is
a judgey, holier-than-thou

15:37.891 --> 15:40.825
know-it-all who never
lets anything go.

15:41.961 --> 15:43.895
But she won't have to be judgey,

15:43.897 --> 15:46.848
if her husband-to-be can
remember to keep it in his pants.

15:46.883 --> 15:48.816
And if he's taken it out,

15:48.868 --> 15:51.686
he might want to mention that now.

15:51.721 --> 15:53.441
I'm starting to think
your mom didn't get

15:53.467 --> 15:55.064
the beer with the
sleeping pill in it.

15:55.091 --> 15:58.643
I know how we can put an end to this.

16:00.714 --> 16:01.979
Hey, Riley!

16:02.015 --> 16:03.981
You idiot! You locked us in here!

16:04.017 --> 16:05.633
How do you know it wasn't Danny?

16:05.668 --> 16:07.085
Because my son loves me.

16:08.938 --> 16:10.922
Yeah, it was probably Danny.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.891
- Hello.
- Both: Hi.

16:13.927 --> 16:14.992
I'm Doctor...

16:15.028 --> 16:16.894
I'm the doctor,

16:16.930 --> 16:18.980
and I'll be performing
the procedure today.

16:19.015 --> 16:21.749
We're so excited. Should I
put my feet up in the stirrups?

16:21.785 --> 16:22.917
Oh God, no!

16:22.969 --> 16:25.903
Uh, not until I've done the final test

16:25.939 --> 16:27.839
on the sample in question.

16:27.874 --> 16:29.657
Do you have it?

16:29.692 --> 16:32.627
No. Isn't that your job?

16:32.662 --> 16:35.113
Yes, of course. Sometimes
people like to bring their own.

16:36.116 --> 16:38.633
Though we do charge a corkage fee.

16:42.005 --> 16:43.971
- Oh, here it is.
- That's my coffee.

16:44.007 --> 16:45.990
Good, 'cause the steam
was starting to worry me.

16:46.025 --> 16:49.811
Uh, I'll just... need
another minute here.

16:52.065 --> 16:53.915
We just have to get
along for two more hours

16:53.967 --> 16:55.896
and then we don't have
to see any of these

16:55.922 --> 16:57.735
stupid people's stupid
faces ever again.

16:57.771 --> 16:59.704
Hey, Nathan.

16:59.706 --> 17:00.805
- (glass tinging)
- Excuse me.

17:00.857 --> 17:03.658
If we can please have
everyone's attention.

17:03.710 --> 17:05.742
Jeremy and I want to
take a moment to thank

17:05.779 --> 17:07.728
our dear friends, Danny and Riley,

17:07.763 --> 17:10.647
for hosting such a
beautiful party for us.

17:10.683 --> 17:13.617
Can you give Rhonda a mic
and turn on the sound system?

17:13.653 --> 17:15.670
- Thank you.
- (Feedback whines)

17:15.704 --> 17:16.971
So what I
was saying...

17:17.022 --> 17:19.906
Bonnie: If you could've just
shut up for two seconds...

17:19.959 --> 17:21.925
Jennifer: Me? It's not my
fault Danny and Riley broke up.

17:21.961 --> 17:24.028
This engagement party is a disaster.

17:24.030 --> 17:26.881
Bonnie: Who cares? They're
never going to make it, anyway.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.834
Riley told me everyone
thinks Rhonda is a lesbian.

17:29.886 --> 17:32.737
I... I said
thespian!

17:32.739 --> 17:33.788
You are terrific actress, Rhonda.

17:33.823 --> 17:35.740
Dude, shut that off.

17:35.792 --> 17:37.842
- (grunts)
- (Screams)

17:37.844 --> 17:39.827
Jennifer: You know
what the worst part is?

17:39.863 --> 17:42.797
If Danny and Riley can't
make it work, who can?

17:42.849 --> 17:45.766
Bonnie: I just know that they're
going to get through this.

17:45.802 --> 17:48.986
I've never seen two people
more perfect for each other.

17:51.057 --> 17:53.641
Honey, I swear, she's just my roommate.

17:53.676 --> 17:55.910
Rhonda!

17:57.931 --> 17:59.063
(sighs)

17:59.098 --> 18:01.766
- I'm tired of fighting.
- Me too.

18:02.852 --> 18:04.902
How do we get through this?

18:04.938 --> 18:06.771
We just have to figure out
a way to make this work.

18:08.691 --> 18:09.907
That's what I want too.

18:09.943 --> 18:12.693
But... I mean as friends,

18:12.729 --> 18:14.045
not together.

18:15.632 --> 18:17.031
For now.

18:18.117 --> 18:20.034
If you add "for now," I'll be cool.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.954
For now.

18:26.926 --> 18:28.793
(whispered scream) Ben!

18:29.879 --> 18:31.829
- Ben, where are you?
- Tucker?

18:31.865 --> 18:33.798
What are you doing back here?

18:33.833 --> 18:35.783
I'm looking for you.

18:35.818 --> 18:37.902
Hey, look, I just wanted to apologize,

18:37.904 --> 18:40.688
for Ben, and maybe, uh,

18:40.723 --> 18:41.856
maybe you can let me make it up to you?

18:41.891 --> 18:43.858
It's okay. A lot of
first-timers freak out.

18:43.910 --> 18:46.694
- But I get off at 5:00.
- Is that Ben's...

18:47.730 --> 18:49.664
little Bens?

18:49.699 --> 18:51.782
You know I can't tell you that.

18:51.784 --> 18:53.751
I know. I know. I'm teasing.

18:53.803 --> 18:56.654
- So you get off at 5:00?
- Mm-hmm.

18:56.689 --> 18:59.040
- Did you say you like sushi?
- Tucker!

19:02.695 --> 19:03.995
Oh, my God.

19:03.997 --> 19:07.014
Pay no attention to this
woman, she's posing as a nurse.

19:07.066 --> 19:08.566
That's our donor.

19:08.618 --> 19:11.836
Our doctor's our donor?
Oh, that doesn't seem right.

19:12.939 --> 19:14.855
He is not a doctor.

19:14.908 --> 19:16.924
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Miller,

19:16.960 --> 19:19.727
but the insemination won't
be taking place today.

19:19.762 --> 19:21.779
I can't keep doing this.

19:21.781 --> 19:23.764
Maybe it's time to stop trying.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.850
If anyone's destined
to be a mom, it's you.

19:28.838 --> 19:30.788
Wow.

19:30.790 --> 19:33.724
Never knew how hard some people
have to work to make this happen.

19:33.726 --> 19:35.810
Never realized what a lucky guy I am.

19:35.862 --> 19:38.646
I don't know what I'd
do without my daughter.

19:38.698 --> 19:41.799
Honestly, you seem like
you'd be great parents.

19:41.834 --> 19:45.703
You know what? I'm going
to help you start a family.

19:46.739 --> 19:48.773
The donation was destroyed.

19:48.808 --> 19:51.659
Oh, pfft! That's okay. I
can totally make some more.

19:51.711 --> 19:53.711
It just takes two
seconds. What do you say?

19:55.832 --> 19:57.748
I think you should call the police.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.800
- Already dialing.
- Already going.

20:02.889 --> 20:04.889
You know, I never got my 200.

20:06.759 --> 20:08.643
Just keep it. Keep it.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.898
Do you really think
Riley should forgive him?

20:16.933 --> 20:19.690
Mm. Look, I will defend
my son to the grave.

20:19.703 --> 20:21.603
But honestly,

20:21.638 --> 20:24.173
you do the crime, you
got to do the time.

20:24.207 --> 20:26.809
