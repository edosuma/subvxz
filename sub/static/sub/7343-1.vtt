Missed you at poker this week.

Thanks for the call.

Hey. Sean, we gotta talk about this.

03:48.146 --> 03:50.189

- Without my speaking part, we'd visit you...

to receive the whole message, so...

to boost your signal.

No. That's what it says.

- Robert Louis Stevenson.
- The author.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.263
He was born way before 1883.
Gotta be somebody else.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.766

- ...last name is going fast. A runner?
- What if his last name...

07:50.471 --> 07:52.431
...is fast?

So "Lemuel" must be...

08:06.070 --> 08:08.823
Nice. Lemuel Gulliver.

- We have three different books.
- By three different authors.

08:12.243 --> 08:14.286
HANK:
About three different islands.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.497
Maybe...

08:17.123 --> 08:19.667
Maybe all three books
are about the same island.

08:19.834 --> 08:22.086
Maybe that's why nobody else
has ever found it...

08:22.253 --> 08:24.714
...because they haven't used
the other two books.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.257

08:26.424 --> 08:28.551

Yeah, Swift has one too.

08:28.843 --> 08:30.886
These are different than Verne's.
I don't get it.

What are you doing?

08:44.483 --> 08:46.318

in the Navy, Sean?

08:46.485 --> 08:47.862
No.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.180
Longitude and latitude.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.812
...here.

09:22.313 --> 09:25.816
That's 100 miles off the coast of Palau,
in the middle of the South Pacific.

09:29.445 --> 09:30.321
What are you doing?

09:30.488 --> 09:32.448
- I gotta go.
- Go where?

09:32.615 --> 09:33.741
To Mysterious Island.

09:33.908 --> 09:37.119
All right, cool. Hey, can you stop by
the moon and grab me a Slurpee?

09:37.286 --> 09:38.412
Joke all you want.

09:38.579 --> 09:42.708
Yeah, I will, and you're gonna be here to listen to it.
You're not going to Palau, Sean.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.877
Why not?

09:45.044 --> 09:48.005
Number one, you're grounded.
On top of that, you got school.

09:48.172 --> 09:52.426

a couple days. This is Mysterious Island.

...around the world...

09:56.305 --> 09:57.765
...meet up with some lunatic...

09:57.932 --> 10:00.518
- ...messing around on a ham radio?
- It's not some lunatic.

10:01.644 --> 10:05.147
It's Alexander Anderson,
my grandfather.

10:06.107 --> 10:07.858
How would you know he sent that?

10:08.025 --> 10:10.653
Makes sense.
He's the original Vernian in the family...

10:10.820 --> 10:15.074
...he's been looking for the island half his
life and nobody's heard from him in two years.

10:15.241 --> 10:18.619
- I think he's in trouble. I'm gonna find him.
- Sean, stop. Sean.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.788
Stop!

10:20.955 --> 10:24.500
I'm not letting you go on a rescue mission
by yourself. Whether you like it or not...

10:25.167 --> 10:26.919
...you're still a kid.

10:27.086 --> 10:30.089
Look, I understand your situation, okay?

10:30.256 --> 10:33.884
You wanna make my mom happy
and I appreciate that. I really do.

10:34.051 --> 10:37.096
But you need to just focus on
running your construction company...

10:37.263 --> 10:40.975
...and paying the mortgage
and asking her how her day was...

10:41.142 --> 10:42.685
...because I'm okay.

10:42.852 --> 10:46.313
And like it or not,
this is bigger than you.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.787
Apparently the message
was sent by his grandfather.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.124
Sean said he's been missing
for a couple years.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.626
It's hard to be missing
if you were never around.

11:07.793 --> 11:11.505
I wouldn't trust one word
from Alexander Anderson.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.257
Sean seems really convinced.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.593
Oh, it's always convincing
from Alexander.

11:15.759 --> 11:19.096
I see. So in Sean's mind,
Alexander's this glamorous adventurer.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.431
LIZ:
When in reality...

11:20.598 --> 11:23.809
...he was a man that wasn't there
when his family needed him the most.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.561
That's why we need to let Sean...

11:25.728 --> 11:27.396
- ...go on this trip.
- Why?

11:27.563 --> 11:29.023
Sean needs a man in his life.

11:29.190 --> 11:31.692
Somebody who'll be there for him
and connect with him.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.320
We were cracking that code,
that was the first time...

11:34.486 --> 11:36.488
...that we were on the same page.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.617
Then bond with him on some
non-mysterious island, like Hawaii.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.494
Ah, Hawaii. Our honeymoon.

I'm serious too.

11:49.585 --> 11:50.794
We'll fly down to Palau.

11:50.961 --> 11:54.298
When Sean realizes the island's not real,
his grandfather's not there...

11:54.465 --> 11:57.635
...I'll be there to cushion the blow,
and done will be done.

too busy for this.

We're going to Palau.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.657
What?

12:22.451 --> 12:24.703
I know you've won
the esteemed Rochefort Award...

12:24.870 --> 12:27.957
...but I've been on these adventures before
so let me handle this.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.876
Easy, buddy. Just remember
who's financing this whole trip.

12:31.043 --> 12:33.170
Queen Isabella didn't tag along
with Columbus.

12:33.337 --> 12:36.257
Okay, Isabella. I'll let you
handle your thing. We'll see how...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.133
Wait, watch the lizard. Watch.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.969
Big man's afraid of a little lizard?

12:40.135 --> 12:43.555
Big man's not afraid. I love lizards
when they're boots and belts.

to have this talk with you, buddy.

36:26.394 --> 36:29.063
There are three things to know
about understanding girls.

36:29.647 --> 36:32.233
Number one:
Don't follow your instincts.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.443
Any other area in life...

36:34.610 --> 36:37.405
...instincts will get you there.
Not with women.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.282
So whatever you think you should do,
do the opposite.

36:40.825 --> 36:43.494
Number two:
You need to be open, sensitive.

36:43.703 --> 36:48.332
Women don't want a man just because he's
big and strong and has abs like mine. No.

36:48.499 --> 36:52.336
They want a thinker, they want a feeler.
They want someone who can understand them.

36:52.503 --> 36:56.590
Women want a man who is in touch
with his most inner emotions.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.968
And the third thing is the most important.

37:00.302 --> 37:03.472
It's something that women have
responded to for thousands of years.

37:04.432 --> 37:05.433
Well, tell me.

37:05.766 --> 37:08.227
You have got to do this.

37:13.941 --> 37:14.817
What is that?

37:14.984 --> 37:18.571
That is the pec pop of love.
Now go on and throw a berry.

37:18.779 --> 37:20.239
- No.
- Throw a berry.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.575
There's some behind you.
Grab one and throw it.

37:22.742 --> 37:24.618

ALEXANDER: The same Atlantis that Verne
wrote about, down to the last detail.

40:10.701 --> 40:12.369
But wasn't Atlantis underwater?

40:12.578 --> 40:16.749
Oh, when Verne wrote about it, it was,
but it has a 140-year cycle...

40:16.916 --> 40:19.168
...and spends half its time
above the water.

40:19.335 --> 40:22.171
- What about the other half?
SEAN: It's called tectonic recurrence.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.673
The ocean bed buckles
due to volcanic activity...

40:24.840 --> 40:26.467
...pulling land to the surface.

40:28.218 --> 40:32.932
Then the entire island
sinks back to the bottom of the sea.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.100
SEAN: Nobody's ever seen it
on this big of a scale.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.435
This is amazing.

40:36.644 --> 40:37.770
Come with me.

40:42.024 --> 40:46.445
I've been looking for this
piece of paradise for 30 years.

40:46.654 --> 40:50.950
I promised your old man
that we'd find it together.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.619

That is why I encoded that message.

41:01.669 --> 41:04.838
I wanted an Anderson to see this place...

41:05.005 --> 41:07.216
...before anyone else.

41:07.591 --> 41:12.513
Some men get to put their names
on stars, species...

41:12.680 --> 41:15.015
...plants. We get to put our name...

41:16.016 --> 41:18.519
...on this gorgeous island.

41:19.019 --> 41:22.314
In two weeks, we'll contact the authorities
to pick us up...

41:22.481 --> 41:25.651
...and in three weeks, we'll be
on the cover of <i>TIME</i> magazine.

41:25.818 --> 41:26.485
Guys.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.278
We got a problem.

41:28.487 --> 41:29.697
What?

41:30.197 --> 41:31.699
You see this? It's saltwater.

41:31.865 --> 41:35.619
The only way saltwater gets this far inland
is if it enters the subsoil from below.

41:35.828 --> 41:36.495
So...?

41:36.662 --> 41:38.163
This island's about to go under.

41:38.330 --> 41:40.708
The only saltwater here
is on your brain.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.835
I've analyzed the samples...

41:43.002 --> 41:44.878
...and I've calculated the numbers.

41:45.045 --> 41:48.090
This island isn't due to sink
for 14 years.

41:48.298 --> 41:49.967
Alexander, your numbers are wrong.

41:50.259 --> 41:52.928
- And how would you know that?
HANK: I've come across this...

41:53.095 --> 41:56.181
...as we build over runoff areas.
It's called soil liquefaction.

41:56.348 --> 42:00.686
Look, you can see it in the cracks in the
confining beds all along here, along here...

42:03.105 --> 42:04.815
...over there, back here.

42:04.982 --> 42:06.859
ALEXANDER:
Okay, you made your point.

42:07.026 --> 42:09.028
GABATO:
Well, how long do we have?

42:09.194 --> 42:12.364
If I had to guess,
based on all this water...

42:13.741 --> 42:14.783
...two, three days max.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.579
Then what? Because I ain't
no flotation device, man.

42:18.746 --> 42:20.330
You will be,
we don't figure this out.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.332
There must be some way
off this island.

42:22.499 --> 42:23.667
GABATO:
We could build a boat.

42:23.834 --> 42:26.378
HANK: The storm around this island
will chew it up, spit it out.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.088
I've got something.

42:28.255 --> 42:29.381
What about the <i>Nautilus?</i>

42:29.548 --> 42:32.551
How is an exercise machine
gonna help us get out of here?

42:32.718 --> 42:36.013
No, no, the Nautilus.
Captain Nemo's submarine, built in 1870.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.181
ALEXANDER:
Well done, Sean.

42:37.806 --> 42:42.561
Chapter 16, Verne wrote
it is hidden on the island.

42:42.728 --> 42:46.732
If we can make it there in time, we can
ride it under the hurricane back to Palau.

42:46.899 --> 42:48.984
HANK:
Okay. One question:

42:49.401 --> 42:50.069
Where is it?

42:50.360 --> 42:54.448
There's only one man
who can tell us that...

42:54.615 --> 42:58.327
...and that is Captain Nemo himself.

43:08.045 --> 43:09.379
The Dakkar Grotto.

43:09.922 --> 43:11.965
The final resting place of Captain Nemo.

43:12.132 --> 43:13.967
Legend has it
his crew buried him there.

43:14.301 --> 43:16.804
I'll tell you what had better be in there:

43:17.054 --> 43:18.388
Nemo's journal.

43:18.555 --> 43:21.767
It could tell us the location
of the Nautilus.

43:21.934 --> 43:26.230
I've never been able to crawl in there
on my own. Too many fried eggs, I'm afraid.

43:26.396 --> 43:27.523
(ALEXANDER CHUCKLES)

43:27.689 --> 43:29.274
I'll go.

43:30.025 --> 43:31.360
I'm the only one who can fit.

43:31.652 --> 43:33.070
No way. It's too dangerous.

43:33.237 --> 43:34.905
Sweet, but I don't need
your permission.

43:41.411 --> 43:42.412

43:42.830 --> 43:45.332

- You remember the drill.

44:58.447 --> 45:00.449
So that's what a sinking island
sounds like.

45:10.959 --> 45:11.627

Hi.

terrible handwriting.

45:31.813 --> 45:34.191
- Looks like Sanskrit.
- Close. It's Hindi.

45:34.358 --> 45:35.734
Yeah, Nemo's from India.

45:35.901 --> 45:37.402
It says here...

45:37.569 --> 45:39.738
...that the Nautilus is in a basalt...

45:39.905 --> 45:42.699
...cave on the other side
of the island, just...

45:42.866 --> 45:44.618
...under Poseidon's Cliffs.

45:46.787 --> 45:47.454
I know...

45:47.621 --> 45:48.413
...this place.

45:48.622 --> 45:49.957
That's where we gotta go.

45:50.165 --> 45:51.416
What's the best way there?

45:51.583 --> 45:53.001
Well, now, that depends.

45:53.168 --> 45:55.796
The safest way
is around the shoreline...

45:55.963 --> 45:58.840
...but the fastest way
is across the heart of the island.

45:59.466 --> 46:00.634
What do you think, Hank?

46:00.801 --> 46:03.428
- I think we got no choice. The quickest way.
- He's right.

46:03.595 --> 46:04.805
- I'm in.
ALEXANDER: Yeah, but...

46:04.972 --> 46:06.306
...let me warn you.

46:06.473 --> 46:08.392
The heart of this island...

46:08.642 --> 46:13.522
...is full of jagged mountains,
dark jungles and terrifying creatures...

46:13.689 --> 46:16.024
...who will give you nightmares.

46:16.191 --> 46:17.442

48:11.056 --> 48:14.851
The tectonic plates are starting
to pull apart underneath the island.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.062
We gotta move.
Let's go. Move.

48:17.270 --> 48:18.688
Move.

48:26.113 --> 48:27.864
Wait, what is that?

48:34.788 --> 48:35.956
Volcanic ash?

48:36.123 --> 48:37.666
It looks like...

48:38.375 --> 48:39.292
ALEXANDER:
Gold.

48:41.711 --> 48:42.921
Pure gold.

48:43.088 --> 48:44.423
The treasure Stevenson...

48:44.589 --> 48:46.258
talked about in Treasure Island.

48:46.591 --> 48:50.637
Volcanoes are made of what they erupt. So
if that thing's erupting gold, then it's...

48:50.971 --> 48:52.472
A mountain of gold.

48:53.390 --> 48:54.850
SEAN:
Must be massive gold deposits.

48:55.016 --> 48:56.393
Let's go check it out.

48:56.601 --> 49:00.021
Hold on. That'll take us days
out of our way. We don't have the time.

Let's make the time. Volcanic gold?
That's a huge scientific breakthrough.

49:04.484 --> 49:06.194
I understand,
but we gotta get to the Nautilus.

49:07.028 --> 49:09.990
Hank, I'm not just a little kid. Okay?
I get a say in this too.

49:10.490 --> 49:13.910
Sean, I am responsible for you.
I'd never take a chance with your life.

49:14.077 --> 49:16.830
Hey, hey, you can't tell him what to do.

49:16.997 --> 49:18.999
- You're not his father.
HANK: From what I hear...

49:19.166 --> 49:20.750
...you haven't been
much of a grandfather.

49:20.917 --> 49:23.253
I have given him something to live up to.

49:23.420 --> 49:26.590
Science, adventure, wonder.

49:26.756 --> 49:28.133
What have you ever given him?

49:28.341 --> 49:31.887
I've given him a lot of things, a sense
of responsibility being one of them.

49:32.345 --> 49:34.973
Something clearly you don't have.

49:36.183 --> 49:37.350

50:33.031 --> 50:34.991
Yeah. Fine.

50:35.283 --> 50:39.204
It's just, you know, I don't need Hank
trying to tell me what to do all the time.

50:39.412 --> 50:43.458
My dad's always trying to get involved too,
but he usually ends up embarrassing me.

50:43.625 --> 50:44.709
Yeah? How?

50:44.918 --> 50:46.753
Last summer I was trying to get a job...

50:46.920 --> 50:51.341
...so he flew all over Palau dropping thousands
of copies of my resume from his helicopter.

50:52.926 --> 50:55.637
That's embarrassing.
Isn't that the worst when they try so hard?

50:56.972 --> 50:58.348
No.

50:59.724 --> 51:02.435
I mean, the worst would be
if they didn't try at all.

51:14.614 --> 51:17.284
Alexander, are you sure
your compass readings are correct?

51:17.450 --> 51:20.745
- Of course I am. Why?
- Why? Because we're down here...

51:20.912 --> 51:24.791
...and we need to be all the way up there.

51:24.958 --> 51:26.876
...a solution, my large friend...

Well, we'll go get some water.

pop it back in, buddy.

58:32.885 --> 58:33.678
Wasn't so bad.

It wasn't very good.

- Good.
