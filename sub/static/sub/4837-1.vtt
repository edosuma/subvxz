"We shall not cease from exploration

00:22.505 --> 00:25.465
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

00:25.545 --> 00:28.505
and know the place for the first time."
- T.S. Eliot, "Little Gidding"

00:28.585 --> 00:34.505
"After the game is before the game."
- S. Herberger

01:51.925 --> 01:54.215
<i>Man, </i>

01:54.335 --> 01:58.505
<i>probably the most mysterious species</i>
<i>on our planet. </i>

01:58.675 --> 02:01.795
<i>A mystery of unanswered questions. </i>

02:01.925 --> 02:05.755
<i>Who are we? Where do we come from? </i>

02:05.925 --> 02:11.335
<i>Where are we going? </i>
<i>How do we know what we think we know? </i>

02:12.255 --> 02:15.795
<i>Why do we believe anything at all? </i>

02:15.965 --> 02:19.925
<i>Countless questions in search of an answer, </i>

02:20.045 --> 02:25.045
<i>an answer that will give rise</i>
<i>to a new question, </i>

02:25.135 --> 02:30.885
<i>and the next answer will give rise</i>
<i>to the next question and so on. </i>

02:32.295 --> 02:37.095
<i>But, in the end, </i>
<i>isn't it always the same question? </i>

02:37.335 --> 02:41.795
<i>And always the same answer? </i>

02:43.545 --> 02:49.045
The ball is round.
The game lasts 90 minutes. That's a fact.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.545
Everything else is pure theory.

02:52.755 --> 02:53.835
Here we go!

03:00.755 --> 03:03.045
RUN LOLA RUN

04:48.925 --> 04:50.335
- Manni?
- Lola.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.585
What's up? Where are you?

04:53.095 --> 04:55.465
Where were you, damn it?

04:55.545 --> 05:00.335
- I got there too late.
- But why today? You're always on time!

05:00.415 --> 05:03.755
My moped got ripped off. It doesn't matter.

05:03.835 --> 05:05.295
Yes, it matters!

05:05.925 --> 05:07.375
What's wrong?

05:08.505 --> 05:12.505
It wasn't my fault, Manni.
I went to get some cigarettes.

05:12.585 --> 05:15.135
<i>I can't believe how fast that guy was. </i>

05:15.715 --> 05:18.255
<i>There was nothing I could do. </i>
<i>He was gone before I got outside. </i>

05:18.335 --> 05:20.095
<i>I even took a taxi. </i>

05:20.295 --> 05:24.795
<i>That dumbass drove east. </i>
<i>They got a Grunewald Street there, too. </i>

05:24.885 --> 05:26.545
<i>When I noticed, it was too late. </i>

05:26.625 --> 05:30.885
<i>It just didn't occur to me. </i>
<i>I was so screwed up because of our moped. </i>

05:30.965 --> 05:33.675
<i>- Doesn't matter. </i>
<i>- And when I got there, you were gone. </i>

05:34.505 --> 05:37.215
It doesn't matter now anyway. I'm done for.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.215
- But why?
- Help me, Lola!

05:40.415 --> 05:42.965
<i>I don't know what to do. </i>

05:43.795 --> 05:46.095
You weren't there, and I messed it up.

05:46.175 --> 05:48.585
<i>I blew it. I'm such a jerk! </i>

05:49.135 --> 05:52.295
<i>Just calm down. Now what happened? </i>

05:52.505 --> 05:55.755
<i>Just tell me what happened, okay? </i>

05:55.835 --> 05:59.175
Lola, he's gonna kill me. I'm gonna die.

05:59.255 --> 06:01.795
Stop it! You're scaring me. What's up?

06:02.045 --> 06:05.925
<i>- Did you get caught? </i>
- No, but that would've been something.

06:06.505 --> 06:10.795
<i>Everything went really great. We drove</i>
<i>the cars there, and those guys came. </i>

06:11.335 --> 06:14.295
<i>They paid, and that was it. Easy as pie. </i>

06:14.375 --> 06:18.965
<i>I got waved across the border, </i>
<i>and then they dropped me off out there. </i>

06:19.045 --> 06:23.005
<i>Then I went to see that cyclops, </i>
<i>and he was finished in no time. </i>

06:23.095 --> 06:26.675
<i>And everything was on time, except for you. </i>

06:26.925 --> 06:28.835
<i>You weren't there. </i>

06:31.175 --> 06:34.415
- Then what?
- Nothing. Not even a phone booth.

06:34.505 --> 06:38.095
<i>I couldn't even call a taxi, </i>
<i>so I walked to the subway station. </i>

06:38.175 --> 06:41.415
<i>On the train, there was this bum</i>

06:41.505 --> 06:44.215
<i>who somehow fell down, </i>
<i>and suddenly these inspectors showed up. </i>

06:45.625 --> 06:48.335
<i>And I got out like always, an old reflex. </i>

07:00.335 --> 07:06.045
- The bag!
- The bag.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.005
The bag!

07:37.965 --> 07:41.675
I'm such a fucking amateur! A dumbass!

07:41.755 --> 07:46.545
<i>This could only happen to me! If you'd</i>
<i>picked me up, it wouldn't have happened. </i>

07:46.625 --> 07:49.505
<i>I was so out of it. </i>
<i>You're always on time otherwise! </i>

07:49.585 --> 07:52.465
<i>- Didn't you call the next station? </i>
<i>- Sure. </i>

07:52.545 --> 07:55.465
<i>But it was too late. </i>
<i>The fucking bag was already gone. </i>

07:55.545 --> 07:58.715
<i>And I know who has it. That bum! </i>
<i>That plastic-bag freak! </i>

07:58.795 --> 08:01.585
<i>He's on a plane to Florida or Hawaii</i>

08:01.675 --> 08:05.755
<i>or Canada or Hong Kong</i>
<i>or Bermuda or whatever. </i>

08:09.295 --> 08:11.715
- What about Ronnie?
<i>- He'll kill me. </i>

08:11.795 --> 08:14.005
- You gotta tell him.
- Forget it!

08:14.095 --> 08:16.375
- Why?
- He won't believe a single word.

08:16.465 --> 08:20.585
<i>I kept a carton of cigarettes once. </i>
<i>He noticed right away. </i>

08:21.135 --> 08:22.295
<i>He doesn't believe anybody. </i>

08:22.375 --> 08:26.965
The jobs with those mercs was a kind of test

08:27.965 --> 08:30.135
<i>to see if he could trust me. </i>

08:32.335 --> 08:34.794
How much was there, in the bag?

08:35.465 --> 08:38.174
- 100,000.
- What?

08:39.255 --> 08:43.174
- 100,000. A test.
- Oh, shit!

08:43.255 --> 08:46.045
<i>See! I knew you wouldn't come up</i>
<i>with any idea. </i>

08:46.135 --> 08:49.415
I always said someday
you wouldn't know what to do.

08:49.505 --> 08:51.415
Not when you die, sooner!

08:51.505 --> 08:54.135
You said, "Love can do everything."

08:54.215 --> 08:57.415
- So find 100,000 marks in 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes?

08:57.505 --> 09:01.415
At 12:00 by the water tower
around the corner, Ronnie said.

09:01.505 --> 09:03.295
<i>- In 20 minutes. </i>
- Run away, Manni!

09:03.375 --> 09:05.255
- No.
- Why not?

09:05.675 --> 09:09.625
- Nobody escapes Ronnie.
- I'll go with you.

09:09.885 --> 09:13.175
When Ronnie gets here in 20 minutes,
I'll be a goner.

09:13.255 --> 09:14.255
Stop it, Manni!

09:14.335 --> 09:17.885
What for? You can't get me 100 grand either!

09:17.925 --> 09:22.135
He'll rub me out, and all that's
left of me will be 100,000 ashes

09:22.215 --> 09:25.545
floating down the Spree to the North Sea,
and no more Manni!

09:25.625 --> 09:28.885
- You can't do a thing!
- Shut up!

09:38.545 --> 09:39.755
Listen.

09:39.835 --> 09:44.505
Wait for me. I'll help you.
Stay put. I'll be there in 20 minutes.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.885
<i>- Okay? </i>
- Gonna pawn all your jewelry?

09:46.965 --> 09:47.965
Where are you?

09:49.095 --> 09:53.045
In a phone booth, downtown,
in front of the Spirale Bar.

09:53.755 --> 09:56.585
<i>Okay, stay where you are. </i>
<i>I promise I'll come up with something. </i>

09:56.675 --> 09:58.135
In 20 minutes, okay?

09:59.925 --> 10:03.005
What the hell. I'll go over to the Bolle
and get that 100 grand.

10:03.095 --> 10:04.175
Cut it out!

10:04.255 --> 10:07.885
Ronnie said they make 200 grand a day,
so they must have 100 grand by noon.

10:08.135 --> 10:12.095
<i>You're nuts! Don't do a thing! </i>
<i>Just stay in the damned booth! I'm coming. </i>

10:12.545 --> 10:15.465
- That's it. I'll rob the store.
- Are you cracked?

10:15.545 --> 10:19.545
- Don't do a thing! Stay put! I'm coming.
- Then what?

10:19.625 --> 10:21.095
I'll think of something!

10:21.175 --> 10:24.295
In 20 minutes I'll be dead
unless I steal the money!

10:24.375 --> 10:26.335
- No, wait!
- What for?

10:26.415 --> 10:29.465
I'll get the money somehow.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.755
I'm going in there at 12:00 if you aren't here.

11:01.925 --> 11:08.135
Okay! Who? Who?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.415
Dad!

11:51.335 --> 11:54.415
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

11:57.005 --> 12:00.215
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

12:00.295 --> 12:04.625
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

12:06.585 --> 12:09.375
Yeah, but you're married too.

13:03.925 --> 13:07.095
Hey! Get your eyes open!

13:10.135 --> 13:11.505
You bitch.

13:11.585 --> 13:12.585
AND
THEN

14:17.415 --> 14:20.295
It's worst at night.

14:20.375 --> 14:23.215
I wake up and can't fall asleep again.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.095
And then I'm afraid.

14:26.175 --> 14:28.255
Me! Afraid of the dark.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.795
I've never been afraid of the dark.
I've never been afraid before.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.135
But I think about us,

14:40.295 --> 14:43.465
and I just think it'll keep going on like this.

14:44.755 --> 14:47.005
And you wouldn't dare...

14:57.175 --> 14:59.925
And then I ask myself what I'm doing here.

15:00.005 --> 15:05.465
How long will this go on?
The secrecy, all this damned lying?

15:06.335 --> 15:11.415
Should I grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?

15:48.465 --> 15:50.415
Hey! You need a bike?

15:52.255 --> 15:54.545
Fifty marks, as good as new.

15:55.135 --> 15:56.585
No.

16:47.625 --> 16:50.795
Hey, man, I know that!

16:50.885 --> 16:53.465
It's not my fault it's so much money!

16:58.505 --> 17:01.415
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

17:17.375 --> 17:19.005
Thanks.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.005
Your phone card!

17:52.835 --> 17:56.045
I have to go. Meyer will be here in a minute.

18:00.545 --> 18:02.925
Can we meet later on?

18:04.135 --> 18:06.885
- Do you love me?
- What?

18:06.965 --> 18:09.045
Do you love me?

18:09.135 --> 18:11.255
Why are you asking now?

18:11.335 --> 18:13.795
Do you love me?

18:13.885 --> 18:16.045
Yes, I do, damn it!

18:17.045 --> 18:19.135
Then decide.

18:19.215 --> 18:20.715
But not now!

18:21.295 --> 18:23.585
You have to decide sometime.

18:23.675 --> 18:26.505
But why now, here, at once?

18:32.925 --> 18:34.755
Because I'm pregnant.

18:44.175 --> 18:49.755
Hey, look at that. Our little princess, Lola!
What a rare pleasure.

18:50.965 --> 18:53.295
- Why the rush?
- Please, let me in.

18:53.715 --> 18:57.925
Little Miss wants to see Big Daddy?
Sure thing.

19:10.045 --> 19:11.755
Sorry.

19:22.135 --> 19:26.255
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

19:31.005 --> 19:32.545
Yes.

19:36.095 --> 19:37.465
Lola?

19:37.545 --> 19:39.135
Dad.

19:39.215 --> 19:41.045
Your daughter?

19:47.505 --> 19:50.215
I'm Jutta Hansen
from the board of directors.

19:50.295 --> 19:52.835
Sorry to interrupt. It's urgent.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.625
It's okay. I was just about to...

19:57.135 --> 20:00.175
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

20:04.675 --> 20:06.005
Nothing.

20:14.675 --> 20:19.095
Listen, if I tell you I need your help

20:19.175 --> 20:23.835
more than ever in my whole life, and
you're the only one who can help me,

20:23.925 --> 20:25.045
would you help me?

20:25.135 --> 20:27.045
- You look terrible.
- Would you help me?

20:27.135 --> 20:30.965
- What happened?
- I can't explain now. Would you help me?

20:31.045 --> 20:32.925
With what, damn it?

20:33.715 --> 20:36.755
- I need 100,000 marks immediately.
- What?

20:36.835 --> 20:40.835
I need it within the next five minutes,
or else...

20:40.925 --> 20:43.335
- Or else what?
- Something terrible will happen!

20:44.175 --> 20:46.715
I don't understand.
What's going on here today?

20:46.795 --> 20:49.625
Please, Dad! You gotta help me! Please!

20:49.715 --> 20:53.045
- I don't have 100,000 marks.
- What about my life insurance?

20:53.135 --> 20:56.095
What about it? It isn't worth 100,000.

20:56.175 --> 20:59.885
Please, Dad. I'm serious. This isn't a joke.

20:59.965 --> 21:04.585
- Yes, it is, Lola! You can't be serious!
- If you don't help me, he'll die!

21:04.675 --> 21:06.375
- Who'll die?
- Manni.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.005
Who's Manni?

21:08.095 --> 21:10.175
My boyfriend, for over a year!

21:10.255 --> 21:14.095
- I don't even know him. Why will he die?
- It doesn't matter!

21:21.505 --> 21:24.295
Okay, come with me.

21:33.675 --> 21:36.175
- Are you going to help me?
- Of course.

21:36.255 --> 21:38.755
Go home and go to bed.

21:38.835 --> 21:43.755
And tell your mother I won't be home
today or tomorrow or ever again.

21:43.835 --> 21:47.375
I'm leaving you guys
and marrying another woman.

21:48.415 --> 21:53.045
We're going to have kids, and I'll try
to be happy because she wants me.

21:53.135 --> 21:58.505
I'm so sick of hearing, "All you do
is work. You always play the boss."

21:58.585 --> 22:02.585
Maybe so, but so what?
You guys have no idea!

22:02.675 --> 22:06.215
I'm so tired of being the fool,
the one to blame!

22:06.295 --> 22:10.965
But Daddy's dough is good enough, huh?
Well, not anymore!

22:14.625 --> 22:18.375
Anyway, I'd never have fathered
a weirdo like you.

22:18.465 --> 22:21.295
- But you did, you jerk!
- No, I didn't!

22:24.675 --> 22:27.215
All I'm saying is you're a cuckoo's egg.

22:34.545 --> 22:36.005
Now you know.

22:38.005 --> 22:41.505
The guy who fathered you
didn't live to see your birth.

22:43.885 --> 22:45.335
Throw her out, please.

22:47.885 --> 22:50.175
Come on! Get her out of here!

23:23.045 --> 23:25.465
Well, we all have our bad days.

23:28.545 --> 23:30.335
See you around.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.965
My dear,

23:45.045 --> 23:47.095
what's wrong?

23:47.925 --> 23:50.175
Do you have the time?

24:31.795 --> 24:33.585
This afternoon?

24:35.675 --> 24:38.135
All right. No, forget it.

24:38.215 --> 24:41.135
It's okay. Yeah.

26:15.375 --> 26:16.965
<i>Wait! </i>

26:18.045 --> 26:19.965
<i>Don't do it! </i>

26:20.045 --> 26:21.965
<i>Manni, please! </i>

26:22.045 --> 26:25.255
<i>Wait for me! </i>

26:26.465 --> 26:28.755
<i>I'll be right there. </i>

26:28.835 --> 26:30.795
<i>Please. </i>

26:30.885 --> 26:34.135
<i>Manni, please, wait! </i>

26:54.925 --> 26:57.505
Manni!

27:15.045 --> 27:16.545
Okay.

27:18.045 --> 27:19.045
Okay.

27:20.255 --> 27:22.625
Lie down on the floor!

27:23.885 --> 27:25.335
On the floor!

27:31.215 --> 27:33.465
Hands behind your head and keep quiet!

27:34.505 --> 27:36.255
Hands behind your head and keep quiet.

27:36.335 --> 27:41.135
Open the cash registers!
Open all the cash registers!

27:43.795 --> 27:48.135
Open them and lie down!
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

27:49.835 --> 27:52.255
I'll shoot anybody who bugs me!

27:54.255 --> 27:55.925
Manni!

27:57.795 --> 28:01.585
- Lola, where were you?
- I couldn't get here faster.

28:02.175 --> 28:05.375
- Will you help me?
- Can't we just get out of here?

28:06.255 --> 28:08.215
Not anymore. You see the shit I'm in.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.335
Why didn't you wait for me?

28:12.415 --> 28:15.585
I did. You got here too late.

28:15.675 --> 28:17.885
So, are you with me?

28:17.965 --> 28:21.135
Put your hands up! Fast!

28:25.755 --> 28:26.835
Come on!

28:31.175 --> 28:33.715
Drop your gun! Hurry up!

28:40.835 --> 28:42.045
Don't move.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.175
The safety catch is on.

28:44.255 --> 28:47.095
- How does it work?
- The little lever on the side.

28:47.175 --> 28:50.795
Girl, listen...

28:54.715 --> 28:56.625
Don't move.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.835
Come here.

29:05.545 --> 29:07.885
Cover me. I'll grab the cash.

29:21.045 --> 29:23.255
Hurry, before the cops come.

30:16.505 --> 30:18.175
Don't move!

31:48.175 --> 31:49.585
Manni?

31:53.885 --> 31:55.795
Do you love me?

31:58.215 --> 31:59.795
Sure, I do.

32:03.045 --> 32:05.465
How can you be so sure?

32:06.505 --> 32:09.415
I don't know. I just am.

32:10.675 --> 32:12.885
I could be some other girl.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.255
Why not?

32:18.925 --> 32:21.005
Because you're the best.

32:21.095 --> 32:23.925
- The best what?
- The best girl.

32:25.505 --> 32:27.415
Of all the girls in the world?

32:28.585 --> 32:29.925
Sure.

32:30.835 --> 32:32.415
How do you know?

32:33.715 --> 32:35.715
I just do.

32:37.545 --> 32:40.045
You think so.

32:40.135 --> 32:42.625
Okay, I think so.

32:43.885 --> 32:46.215
- You see?
- What?

32:46.295 --> 32:47.925
You aren't sure.

32:49.005 --> 32:51.415
Are you nuts or what?

32:57.135 --> 32:59.795
What if you never met me?

33:01.005 --> 33:02.965
What do you mean?

33:05.045 --> 33:07.465
You'd be telling the same thing
to someone else.

33:07.545 --> 33:10.255
Okay, if you don't want to hear it.

33:10.335 --> 33:13.375
I don't want to hear anything.
I want to know how you feel.

33:14.135 --> 33:17.545
Okay, my feelings say

33:20.095 --> 33:21.625
that you're the best.

33:22.545 --> 33:26.215
Who is "your feelings" anyway?

33:26.295 --> 33:27.925
It's me.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.965
My heart.

33:32.045 --> 33:34.755
Your heart says, "Hi, Manni. She's the one."

33:36.215 --> 33:38.415
- Exactly.
- And you say,

33:38.505 --> 33:41.505
"Thanks for the information.
See you around."

33:41.585 --> 33:43.585
Exactly.

33:43.675 --> 33:46.415
And you do whatever your heart says?

33:46.505 --> 33:48.545
Well, it really doesn't "say" anything.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.215
I don't know.

33:53.175 --> 33:54.795
It just feels.

33:55.675 --> 33:57.925
So what does it feel now?

33:58.005 --> 34:00.295
That someone's asking
rather stupid questions.

34:00.625 --> 34:04.415
Man, you aren't taking me seriously.

34:04.675 --> 34:06.675
Lola, what's wrong?

34:07.675 --> 34:11.755
You want to leave me?

34:14.465 --> 34:16.375
I don't know.

34:20.505 --> 34:22.795
I think I have to make a decision.

34:35.215 --> 34:39.094
But I don't want to. I don't want to leave.

34:46.755 --> 34:48.045
Stop.

34:54.545 --> 34:57.215
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

35:00.175 --> 35:03.415
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

35:03.505 --> 35:07.795
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

35:09.755 --> 35:12.545
Yeah, but you're married too.

36:21.335 --> 36:23.465
Watch out, you stupid cow!

36:25.175 --> 36:26.885
Fucking bitch!

37:35.255 --> 37:38.545
- Hey! You need a bike?
- No.

37:38.625 --> 37:41.545
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- But it's stolen!

37:55.925 --> 37:58.625
500? What am I supposed
to do with 500 marks?

38:38.465 --> 38:40.965
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

38:46.465 --> 38:48.045
Yes.

38:58.415 --> 39:01.375
Even if it isn't from you?

39:05.965 --> 39:08.505
Hey, look at that. Our little princess.

39:08.585 --> 39:10.295
I'm in a hurry, please!

39:12.135 --> 39:13.415
Let me in.

39:13.505 --> 39:16.925
Courtesy and composure
are the queen's jewels.

39:17.005 --> 39:21.415
- Let me in, please.
- A little anger is good for the heart,

39:21.505 --> 39:24.335
the circulation, the skin.

39:44.135 --> 39:49.215
I don't care whether it was an accident
or not! Great start for a new love!

39:49.295 --> 39:51.965
If you hadn't neglected me,
it wouldn't have happened.

39:52.045 --> 39:53.755
I have a family!

39:53.835 --> 39:56.885
I can't leave a sick wife and three kids
just to please Her Highness.

39:57.415 --> 39:59.545
Your wife is drunk from morning to night!

39:59.625 --> 40:02.215
So what? What do you know?

40:02.925 --> 40:05.375
Don't you see you're bothering us?

40:07.415 --> 40:08.835
Lola?

40:10.045 --> 40:11.415
Hi, Dad.

40:12.175 --> 40:13.925
Why didn't you knock?

40:15.415 --> 40:16.885
What's going on?

40:16.965 --> 40:20.335
- What do you want?
- Is she your daughter?

40:20.925 --> 40:22.545
Shut the door.

40:27.545 --> 40:29.625
What do you want?

40:29.715 --> 40:32.415
- I need your help.
- You see that I'm busy.

40:32.505 --> 40:34.795
- There's no other way.
- Damn it!

40:34.925 --> 40:37.335
Why are you disturbing me right now?

40:37.415 --> 40:39.585
I have a problem, you understand?

40:43.925 --> 40:47.255
- Who's that slut?
- That's none of your business!

40:56.095 --> 40:57.795
Lola, leave.

40:57.885 --> 41:01.255
Go home. Leave me alone.

41:02.545 --> 41:04.095
I can't!

41:04.175 --> 41:05.505
Why not?

41:06.255 --> 41:07.795
I need money.

41:09.255 --> 41:12.925
- Then get a job.
- I will, but I need the money now!

41:14.505 --> 41:18.715
Okay, just so you get out of here.
How much?

41:18.795 --> 41:21.215
No, no. I need lots more.

41:21.295 --> 41:25.465
- What do you mean, "lots more"?
- A whole lot more!

41:25.545 --> 41:29.095
Aren't you ashamed, barging in like this?
Can't you see we're busy?

41:29.175 --> 41:32.255
I don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
I have other problems.

41:34.715 --> 41:36.135
Don't you dare...

42:05.625 --> 42:07.255
What?

42:23.925 --> 42:26.335
Hey! What's up? What's up?

42:28.505 --> 42:31.505
It just isn't your day today. Doesn't matter.

42:31.585 --> 42:33.505
You can't have everything.

43:11.175 --> 43:12.925
Come with me.

43:15.095 --> 43:16.965
Have you gone crazy?

43:17.045 --> 43:20.795
- Think you can do anything you like?
- Shut up! You go first.

43:20.885 --> 43:25.545
Girl, listen.
You don't know how to use that thing.

43:27.675 --> 43:29.715
Let me make a suggestion.

43:51.885 --> 43:53.375
Get away.

43:56.675 --> 43:59.335
- Listen, dear, we can talk it over...
- Fuck off!

44:13.215 --> 44:16.465
- Shit!
- The combination.

44:19.965 --> 44:21.545
Quiet!

44:23.835 --> 44:26.215
Lola, what...

44:27.545 --> 44:29.885
What the heck are you doing?

44:38.135 --> 44:39.215
Open up!

44:52.505 --> 44:56.835
Lola, there are cameras everywhere.
You'll never get out of here.

44:56.925 --> 44:59.625
The police will be here in a second.

44:59.715 --> 45:02.965
You said they always come too late.

45:03.045 --> 45:05.715
Bag it, 100,000.

45:15.835 --> 45:18.095
Come on, little miss.

45:18.965 --> 45:20.585
Leave your daddy alone.

45:21.505 --> 45:24.585
You don't want to hurt anyone, do you?

45:24.675 --> 45:26.175
I don't know.

45:43.715 --> 45:45.625
- I don't have it.
- Why not?

45:47.375 --> 45:49.335
There's only 88,000.

45:50.545 --> 45:53.925
I'll have to get the rest from downstairs.

45:55.755 --> 45:59.175
Okay, get going. Go, go!

46:00.625 --> 46:02.545
Hurry up, man!

46:59.545 --> 47:01.135
100,000.

47:04.795 --> 47:06.375
In there.

47:34.465 --> 47:36.375
Bye, Dad.

47:56.505 --> 47:58.835
I don't believe it.

48:07.505 --> 48:09.415
Hey, girl. Get away.

48:10.835 --> 48:12.505
Get away from there!

48:20.375 --> 48:22.625
Hey, girl, you want to get killed?

48:28.005 --> 48:31.925
<i>Attention! This is the police! </i>

48:32.005 --> 48:36.215
<i>The building is surrounded... </i>

48:37.505 --> 48:40.715
- What a ruckus.
- Do you have the time?

49:06.175 --> 49:07.755
Okay.

49:13.755 --> 49:15.675
Hey, get away!

49:17.585 --> 49:21.135
Give me a lift, will you? Please?

49:21.545 --> 49:23.215
Wait!

50:29.135 --> 50:32.135
<i>Wait, Manni. I'm coming. </i>

50:32.215 --> 50:34.135
<i>I'm almost there. </i>

50:34.215 --> 50:39.835
<i>Wait! I'm gonna make it. </i>

52:37.835 --> 52:39.295
Lola.

52:41.835 --> 52:44.465
What would you do if I died?

52:45.135 --> 52:47.625
- I wouldn't let you die.
- Yeah, well,

52:48.965 --> 52:51.465
what if I were fatally ill?

52:51.545 --> 52:52.885
I'd find a way.

52:52.965 --> 52:57.215
What if I were in a coma,
and the doc said, "One more day"?

52:57.295 --> 53:00.215
I'd throw you into the ocean, shock therapy.

53:00.295 --> 53:03.465
What if I were dead anyway?

53:05.505 --> 53:07.755
- What do you want to hear?
- Come on. Tell me.

53:09.005 --> 53:11.835
I'd go to the Isle of Rügen
and cast your ashes to the wind.

53:11.925 --> 53:13.175
And then?

53:14.675 --> 53:17.095
I don't know. It's a stupid question.

53:17.175 --> 53:21.505
I know what you'd do. You'd forget me.

53:21.585 --> 53:23.175
- No!
- Sure you would.

53:23.255 --> 53:29.005
What else could you do?
Sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.

53:29.095 --> 53:33.465
Not a bad idea.
And everybody's real compassionate,

53:33.545 --> 53:38.335
and everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.

53:39.505 --> 53:44.175
You can show everyone how strong you
are. "What a great woman," they'll say.

53:44.255 --> 53:47.965
"She really pulls herself together
instead of crying all day."

53:50.095 --> 53:53.675
And all at once this really nice guy
with green eyes shows up.

53:53.755 --> 53:57.135
And he's super sensitive,
listens to you all day.

53:57.215 --> 53:59.135
And you can talk his ear off.

53:59.885 --> 54:02.755
And you can tell him
how tough things are for you,

54:02.835 --> 54:06.585
and that you have to look after yourself
and don't know what's gonna happen,

54:06.675 --> 54:09.885
and blah, blah, blah.

54:09.965 --> 54:14.415
Then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. That's how it goes.

54:15.885 --> 54:18.625
- Manni.
- What?

54:18.715 --> 54:20.625
You haven't died yet.

54:31.005 --> 54:32.585
No?

54:47.585 --> 54:50.675
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

54:53.255 --> 54:56.465
Of course, I knew that Sagittarius
was your ascendant.

54:56.545 --> 55:00.835
Sure, the more I think about it, I don't know.

55:02.795 --> 55:05.585
Yeah, but you're married too.

56:56.795 --> 56:59.625
- Watch out!
- Sorry.

56:59.715 --> 57:01.625
I bet you're sorry.

57:21.675 --> 57:23.795
Fries and a sausage.

57:23.885 --> 57:25.965
Give me another one.

57:29.925 --> 57:32.335
I'll be damned.

57:32.415 --> 57:34.835
Life's really crazy sometimes, isn't it?

57:38.045 --> 57:41.095
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.

57:43.585 --> 57:45.175
You need a bike?

57:46.795 --> 57:49.545
A special price, 70 marks.

58:04.625 --> 58:06.465
Lola?

58:07.755 --> 58:09.255
Mr. Meyer?

58:09.335 --> 58:11.175
Is everything okay?

58:11.675 --> 58:13.135
No.

58:40.885 --> 58:44.415
Tell me, do you want
to have a baby with me?

58:48.045 --> 58:49.675
Yes.

58:53.505 --> 58:55.215
<i>Mr. Meyer is here. </i>

58:56.335 --> 58:58.625
- There's something else.
- Not now.

58:58.715 --> 59:01.255
<i>Mr. Meyer asked if he should park, </i>
<i>or if you're coming out. </i>

59:01.335 --> 59:03.215
Coming.

59:03.505 --> 59:06.415
That's the nicest present
you could ever give me.

59:12.885 --> 59:14.835
Can we meet later on?

59:31.005 --> 59:32.925
Hi there.

59:39.545 --> 59:41.505
Hi there, Ms. Jäger.

59:57.465 --> 59:59.585
- Hi there.
- Hello.

01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:10.095
Hi.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.415
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Meyer.

01:00:40.965 --> 01:00:42.465
Dad!

01:00:49.795 --> 01:00:51.885
Wait!

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:57.795
You know what?
I just had a strange encounter.

01:00:57.885 --> 01:01:00.045
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, with your daughter.

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:02.715
- With whom?
- Your daughter.

01:01:02.795 --> 01:01:04.505
Dad!

01:01:06.505 --> 01:01:08.465
Shit! Shit!

01:01:24.465 --> 01:01:26.295
You've come at last, dear.

01:01:56.465 --> 01:01:57.795
Thanks.

01:01:57.885 --> 01:01:59.505
Wait.

01:02:27.545 --> 01:02:30.375
So I decided it'd be best
for me not to have kids.

01:02:30.465 --> 01:02:33.215
I work so much that they'd never see me.

01:02:38.295 --> 01:02:39.545
Watch out!

01:03:12.715 --> 01:03:16.175
<i>What can I do? </i>

01:03:18.835 --> 01:03:20.755
<i>What can I do? </i>

01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:32.135
<i>Come on. </i>

01:03:34.505 --> 01:03:35.965
<i>Help me. </i>

01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:38.585
<i>Please. </i>

01:03:40.835 --> 01:03:42.795
<i>Just this once. </i>

01:03:44.795 --> 01:03:47.135
<i>I'll just keep on running, okay? </i>

01:03:52.715 --> 01:03:54.545
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

01:03:55.755 --> 01:03:58.335
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

01:03:58.415 --> 01:04:01.215
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:03.625
<i>I'm waiting. </i>

01:04:11.295 --> 01:04:12.925
You wanna get killed?

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:49.005
- How does this work?
- You buy chips

01:04:49.095 --> 01:04:50.755
- and gamble them away.
- Okay.

01:04:54.675 --> 01:04:56.465
You can't go in there like that.

01:04:56.545 --> 01:04:57.885
I have to.

01:04:59.255 --> 01:05:02.295
Ninety-nine marks, 20. What kind of chips?

01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:03.965
One for 100?

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:06.625
You're short.

01:05:07.215 --> 01:05:08.545
Please.

01:05:44.095 --> 01:05:46.375
Place your bets, please.

01:05:54.255 --> 01:05:56.505
Your bets, please.

01:06:06.585 --> 01:06:08.545
No more bets.

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.505
Twenty, black, even, pass. No series.

01:06:24.835 --> 01:06:26.925
1,500 for black.

01:06:33.795 --> 01:06:36.715
One hundred and 400.

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:43.885
Three thousand, five hundred
for 100 marks on 20.

01:06:49.095 --> 01:06:51.295
Here you are, 3,500.

01:07:04.835 --> 01:07:06.095
Come with me, please.

01:07:11.095 --> 01:07:12.835
Just one more game.

01:07:21.545 --> 01:07:23.415
Please place your bets.

01:08:29.925 --> 01:08:33.755
Twenty, black, even, pass.

01:08:40.255 --> 01:08:44.095
Hurry up. I need a plastic bag.

01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:37.675
Stop!

01:09:56.415 --> 01:09:57.835
That's mine.

01:09:57.925 --> 01:10:00.375
I know!

01:10:11.795 --> 01:10:13.255
I'm sorry.

01:10:14.045 --> 01:10:16.295
And what about me?

01:10:20.135 --> 01:10:22.965
At least give me that.

01:11:30.965 --> 01:11:33.135
What're you doing here?

01:11:57.005 --> 01:12:00.295
- I'll stay with him.
- What?

01:12:53.675 --> 01:12:55.625
Okay.

01:13:32.005 --> 01:13:33.545
Manni?

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:50.375
Manni?

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:04.625
Hey.

01:15:08.545 --> 01:15:10.675
What happened to you?

01:15:12.715 --> 01:15:14.335
Did you run here?

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:19.045
Don't worry. Everything's okay. Come on.

01:15:27.545 --> 01:15:29.505
What's in the bag?

01:15:30.305 --> 01:15:36.927
