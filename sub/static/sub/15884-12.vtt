09:41.794 --> 09:42.894
- Yes.
- No matter what.

09:42.928 --> 09:43.995
That's the best job
in the world.

09:44.030 --> 09:45.563
You make up all the rules
as you go,

09:45.597 --> 09:46.898
lots of ladies.

09:46.932 --> 09:50.268
"The Lord has declared
I get a backrub at 2:00."

09:50.302 --> 09:51.903
- All right.
- That's--

09:51.937 --> 09:53.838
I just-- You can do
anything you want.

09:53.873 --> 09:57.209
"We will now pass around
the communion of lemonheads."

09:57.243 --> 09:58.276
That's not--

09:58.311 --> 10:00.378
(laughter)

10:00.413 --> 10:01.713
My concern with cults--

10:01.747 --> 10:04.949
if your messiah looks
more like Jesus than Jesus...

10:04.984 --> 10:07.352
Mm-hmm.

10:07.386 --> 10:09.254
put on the brakes.

10:09.288 --> 10:12.757
If your messiah smells
more like Jesus

10:12.791 --> 10:16.127
than Jesus...

10:16.162 --> 10:19.331
If your messiah looks like
that man right there...

10:19.366 --> 10:23.570
(laughter and applause)

10:23.604 --> 10:24.877
Ohm.

10:27.207 --> 10:29.509
(news fanfare)

10:29.543 --> 10:32.412
Rick Nicklesby reporting live
from a gruesome scene.

10:32.447 --> 10:35.782
<i>A cult known as Q.E.T.,
or Quest for Eternal Truth,</i>

10:35.816 --> 10:38.918
<i>has apparently taken their
own lives in a mass suicide.</i>

10:38.952 --> 10:41.954
<i>Police confirm that
cyanide-laced cherry Kool-Aid</i>

10:41.989 --> 10:43.425
<i>was also on the premises.</i>

10:43.526 --> 10:45.892
Excuse me. Hi.
Rick Nicklesby, Channel 6.

10:45.926 --> 10:47.627
Hi. Are you two
from the neighborhood?

10:47.662 --> 10:49.362
- Yes.
- No.

10:49.397 --> 10:50.897
- No.
- Yes.

10:50.932 --> 10:53.233
(both speaking gibberish)

10:53.267 --> 10:55.567
Okay, were you two members
of the cult that lived here?

10:55.602 --> 10:56.735
The cul-- What cult?

10:56.769 --> 10:58.070
- What?
- Was this a cult right here?

10:58.104 --> 10:59.405
- Cult?
- I had no idea this was a cult.

10:59.439 --> 11:00.439
- No way.
- A cult?

11:00.473 --> 11:01.573
Although I will say,

11:01.608 --> 11:03.108
the term "cult"
is a little judgmental.

11:03.143 --> 11:04.410
I would say
the same thing, yeah.

11:04.444 --> 11:05.778
- Not knowing the full doctrine.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11:05.812 --> 11:07.379
Well, apparently,
they believed that there was

11:07.413 --> 11:09.214
a spaceship waiting for them
behind the Moon.

11:09.249 --> 11:11.716
Okay, well, you know,
that still is really possible.

11:11.751 --> 11:13.085
- Not completely crazy.
- It's possible, right?

11:13.119 --> 11:15.053
I mean, who knows what is
out there in the universe?

11:15.088 --> 11:16.422
Anything could be
behind the Moon.

11:16.456 --> 11:17.957
Okay, well, it appears
they killed themselves

11:17.991 --> 11:19.391
in order to board the ship.

11:19.426 --> 11:20.893
Right, and that's where
we disagreed with them,

11:20.927 --> 11:22.061
right there,
or would have--

11:22.095 --> 11:23.763
we would have disagreed
with them

11:23.797 --> 11:25.431
had we been there
on our departure day--

11:25.466 --> 11:27.533
their departure day.
Their departure day!

11:27.568 --> 11:28.535
- Yeah.
- Which is the day

11:28.569 --> 11:30.203
that they did this.

11:30.237 --> 11:31.671
I mean, that's what you
could call it,

11:31.705 --> 11:33.306
if you wanted to--
I ain't in no cult.

11:33.340 --> 11:36.142
No, I mean, what I always
wondered is how--

11:36.176 --> 11:37.743
or am starting to wonder,

11:37.778 --> 11:40.346
since you brought this
to our attention--

11:40.380 --> 11:42.482
Why-- if there was a spaceship
in the sky,

11:42.516 --> 11:45.052
why wouldn't it just
beam us up-- beam them up?

11:45.086 --> 11:47.154
Right, just beam 'em--
just beam them up.

11:47.188 --> 11:48.555
Why can't you just
beam them up alive?

11:48.590 --> 11:50.223
Why you got to be dead
to get beamed up?

11:50.258 --> 11:51.106
You know what I'm saying?

11:51.154 --> 11:52.452
I've been saying that
for weeks-- seconds.

11:52.489 --> 11:54.962
For seconds, 'cause--
because you, Rick Nicklesby,

11:54.997 --> 11:57.198
you told us that,
you know,

11:57.233 --> 11:58.600
and that's how I knew,
because--

11:58.634 --> 12:00.001
- 15 seconds ago.
- 15 seconds ago, you said it.

12:00.036 --> 12:01.870
I didn't know anything about it
until you said it,

12:01.904 --> 12:03.071
'cause I ain't in no cult.

12:03.105 --> 12:05.006
Okay, then why would someone
join a cult?

12:05.041 --> 12:07.075
- Compelling leadership.
- Charismatic leader.

12:07.109 --> 12:08.777
(stammering)
Like, a compelling--

12:08.811 --> 12:10.379
- Taco Tuesdays.
- A person--

12:10.413 --> 12:11.747
- Taco Tuesdays.
- Taco Tuesdays.

12:11.781 --> 12:12.848
I mean, hypothetically,

12:12.883 --> 12:14.216
they could have had tacos
on Tuesday,

12:14.251 --> 12:15.217
which would have been a draw.

12:15.252 --> 12:16.218
I mean, that would have been
a plus.

12:16.253 --> 12:18.687
Okay, so this is
a tragic day

12:18.721 --> 12:19.988
for this community

12:20.023 --> 12:23.125
and for the members
of the Quest for Earthly Truth.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.095
I'm Rick Nicklesby reporting--

12:26.129 --> 12:27.463
Whoa.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.497
- You see?
- Yep.

12:28.531 --> 12:29.932
- You see?
- Uh-huh.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.034
- Everybody jumped the gun.
- (gasping)

12:32.068 --> 12:35.404
- We're ready!
- (laughing)

12:38.033 --> 12:40.155
(soul music)

12:40.191 --> 12:42.691
Jordan and I lived together.
We lived together.

12:42.726 --> 12:44.859
Who was your landlord when
we lived in that apartment?

12:44.894 --> 12:45.926
My landlord?
Um...

12:45.961 --> 12:47.394
Did you ever meet
your landlord?

12:47.428 --> 12:48.795
- Russian lady.
- Some Russian lady.

12:48.829 --> 12:51.330
Some Russian lady.
Never saw her.

12:51.364 --> 12:53.499
But I love the way-- You always
say we were roommates for,

12:53.533 --> 12:55.735
uh, what, two months?

12:55.769 --> 12:57.370
About two months, yeah.

12:57.404 --> 12:59.806
We weren't roommates, though,
'cause I didn't get no rent.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.541
(laughter)

13:01.575 --> 13:04.177
- Cleaning your bathroom...
- Yeah.

13:04.211 --> 13:05.912
is worth
about six months' rent.

13:05.946 --> 13:08.214
That's true.

13:08.248 --> 13:10.549
(pounding at door)

13:10.583 --> 13:14.386
It's your landlord!
(pounding continues)

13:14.420 --> 13:16.188
Hey, Devon.

13:16.223 --> 13:18.224
Hey, how you doing, brother?

13:18.258 --> 13:19.259
How you doing?
Yeah.

13:19.293 --> 13:22.295
Just, uh, stopping by.

13:22.329 --> 13:25.965
Just wanted to check up
on everything.

13:27.668 --> 13:29.368
- Okay.
- Yeah-- Aha!

13:29.403 --> 13:32.538
You in here,
you little mother[bleep]?

13:32.572 --> 13:34.540
Nope.

13:34.574 --> 13:38.043
Closet look good.

13:38.077 --> 13:40.111
Door is strong.

13:40.145 --> 13:42.280
- So y'all settling in?
- Yeah.

13:42.314 --> 13:45.783
We've been living here
a year and a half, so we have.

13:45.817 --> 13:49.954
So, uh, how are these
cupboards working out for you?

13:49.988 --> 13:52.323
Man, nobody in here...

13:52.357 --> 13:54.125
besides your stuff,
which looks good.

13:54.159 --> 13:55.860
Thank you.

13:55.894 --> 13:57.962
Completely unrelated--

13:57.996 --> 14:01.799
Have y'all seen a 4'11" dude
with a purple beard up in here?

14:01.833 --> 14:02.933
No. No.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.402
No, no one's in here...

14:05.437 --> 14:07.738
probably because we lock
the door.

14:08.915 --> 14:12.065
Oh, he got the body
like a rat.

14:12.077 --> 14:14.879
He can just squeeze
through the vents.

14:14.913 --> 14:16.547
Yeah.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.582
So you think somebody's hiding
in my apartment?

14:18.616 --> 14:19.616
No.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.385
I told you--

14:21.419 --> 14:22.986
It's just a social call.

14:23.021 --> 14:24.755
I mean, why would Gerald be
in here, anyway?

14:24.789 --> 14:26.056
Gerald.

14:26.090 --> 14:28.559
There is a man
with a purple beard

14:28.593 --> 14:30.627
named Gerald in my apartment?

14:30.662 --> 14:31.862
Hell, no!

14:31.896 --> 14:33.897
Why?
Did you see him?

14:33.932 --> 14:35.566
He about 4'9",
got a purple beard.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.801
Yeah.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.402
- Hey, baby--
- (screams maniacally)

14:38.437 --> 14:39.570
- (screams)
- Ugh!

14:39.604 --> 14:41.105
This is-- Agh!

14:41.139 --> 14:43.607
(grunts)

14:43.641 --> 14:45.108
Oh.
(laughs)

14:45.143 --> 14:47.044
Hey, baby girl.

14:47.078 --> 14:49.647
You ain't Gerald.
(snickers)

14:49.681 --> 14:53.017
Oh, by the by, have you seen
A 4'5" purple beard?

14:53.052 --> 14:54.319
Baby...

14:54.353 --> 14:56.487
Devon, what's going on?

14:56.522 --> 14:59.624
Okay, you know,
I'm gonna level with all y'all.

14:59.658 --> 15:03.228
There is a 4'3" [bleep]
with a purple beard named Gerald

15:03.263 --> 15:05.297
somewhere in this building.

15:05.332 --> 15:06.933
Why does he keep getting
smaller

15:06.967 --> 15:08.301
every time you mention him?

15:08.335 --> 15:09.569
Seriously?

15:09.603 --> 15:11.036
'cause I didn't want
to alarm y'all.

15:11.071 --> 15:14.373
He is disturbingly small,
really.

15:14.407 --> 15:15.641
He a good guy.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.343
He smoke rock, though.

15:17.377 --> 15:21.681
I mean, he'll do anything
to get money for crack.

15:21.715 --> 15:23.182
Anything.

15:23.217 --> 15:25.385
Okay.

15:25.419 --> 15:27.353
I mean anything.

15:27.388 --> 15:28.888
I get it.

15:28.923 --> 15:33.726
He will murder you.

15:33.760 --> 15:37.696
Well, we certainly hope
you find him.

15:37.731 --> 15:39.932
Oh, I'm gonna find him.

15:39.966 --> 15:41.633
Don't worry about that,

15:41.667 --> 15:43.535
'cause I'm gonna look low,

15:43.569 --> 15:45.737
and then
I'm gonna look high.

15:45.771 --> 15:48.740
(grunting)

15:48.774 --> 15:50.074
(screams)

15:50.109 --> 15:53.177

16:39.218 --> 16:40.818
A few dads?

16:40.852 --> 16:42.553
All right.

16:42.587 --> 16:44.154
The best thing
about being a father

16:44.188 --> 16:45.154
is the mother.

16:45.189 --> 16:46.289
- It's the mom.
- Right?

16:46.323 --> 16:47.290
It's the mother.

16:47.324 --> 16:48.424
Because of moms,

16:48.459 --> 16:50.493
dads have the default phrase,
right?

16:50.527 --> 16:52.895
What'd your mother say?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.263
I-- Well, I--
Yeah, I didn't ask her yet.

16:54.298 --> 16:56.065
That's why I came to you,
'cause--

16:56.100 --> 16:59.470
Don't do that.

16:59.504 --> 17:01.005
If the kid comes to the dad,

17:01.039 --> 17:02.606
the dad should already
just extrapolate

17:02.641 --> 17:04.308
that the mom
was gonna say no.

17:04.342 --> 17:06.675
'cause you know the dad's made
that mistake before

17:06.711 --> 17:08.077
and got the kid some [bleep],

17:08.112 --> 17:09.945
had to walk
into his wife's room,

17:09.980 --> 17:12.382
talking about...

17:12.415 --> 17:15.351
(laughter)

17:15.386 --> 17:18.188
Slingshots?

17:18.222 --> 17:22.526
They had done
some Jedi mind tricks.

17:22.560 --> 17:26.097
They told me you said
they could have it.

17:26.131 --> 17:27.698
They used
the Jedi mind trick?

17:27.732 --> 17:29.366
They used
the Jedi mind trick, man.

17:29.401 --> 17:32.569
- You'll never have sex again.
- Aw, man.

17:33.938 --> 17:35.639

D-dad? Dad?

Hey, what's wrong, man?

17:42.947 --> 17:44.514
I was having a nightmare.

17:44.548 --> 17:47.251
Oh, again?

17:49.988 --> 17:53.324
- What, you want to talk about it?
- I miss mommy.

17:54.693 --> 17:57.528
Hey, I know.
I know.

17:57.562 --> 17:59.897
It's-- Hey, me too.
Me too, pal.

17:59.931 --> 18:01.198

18:01.232 --> 18:04.100
- Come here, man.
- (sobbing)

18:04.134 --> 18:05.969
It's all right.
Hey, it's okay.

18:06.003 --> 18:08.905
It's gonna be okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

18:08.940 --> 18:11.908
I just don't want anything
to ever happen to you.

18:11.943 --> 18:13.276
Happen to me?

18:13.311 --> 18:16.379
Hey, come on, man, ain't nothing
ever gonna happen to me.

18:16.414 --> 18:18.982
Really?

18:19.016 --> 18:21.751
Y-Yeah.
That's what I said.

18:21.786 --> 18:23.219
So, yes.

18:23.254 --> 18:25.154
That, um, nothing ever gonna
happen to me.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.522
And you ain't never
gonna have to worry

18:26.557 --> 18:27.790
about nothing
happening to me.

18:27.824 --> 18:30.159
But-- But-- what if--

18:30.193 --> 18:32.344
what if you got hit by a car
or something?

18:34.282 --> 18:37.601
That's impossible,
because I will never die,

18:37.636 --> 18:41.139
S-So I can't...

18:41.173 --> 18:42.874
die, no matter what.

18:42.908 --> 18:44.175
You can't die?

18:44.209 --> 18:47.178
But I thought
all human beings died.

18:49.915 --> 18:51.582
That's true.
That's true.

18:51.616 --> 18:53.717
That's science,
so that's true.

18:53.751 --> 18:58.522
But I am lucky,
'cause I am not a human.

18:58.556 --> 18:59.884
You're not?

19:01.159 --> 19:04.194
- I never told you about this?
- No.

19:04.229 --> 19:05.629
Hey, you know,
I'll just let it out.

19:05.663 --> 19:09.967
I'm from a planet called
L-La-- Thelonious,

19:10.001 --> 19:12.302
and the thing is,
it was being destroyed.

19:12.336 --> 19:13.303
Okay.

19:13.337 --> 19:14.604
That's what happened.

19:14.638 --> 19:17.907
My-- was-- I was sent down
here in-- in--

19:17.941 --> 19:20.843
in a capsule to Earth
by my parents.

19:20.878 --> 19:23.146
Oh, like Superman.

19:23.180 --> 19:25.481
Superman, yep.

19:25.516 --> 19:28.851
That is what
it is exactly like, except--

19:28.886 --> 19:30.987
Oh, here's the thing
about my version.

19:31.021 --> 19:33.690
only one superpower--
immortality.

19:33.724 --> 19:35.325
- Oh.
- Yeah.

19:35.359 --> 19:36.459
So I'm tired.

19:36.493 --> 19:38.260
Daddy's tired.

19:38.295 --> 19:40.996
Can you--
Let's go to sleep, okay?

19:41.030 --> 19:43.331
But I'm not going to live
forever, right?

19:43.365 --> 19:45.400
Because I'm only half-alien.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.502
(sobbing)

19:48.537 --> 19:50.738
So I'm gonna die.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.673
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

19:52.707 --> 19:54.641
You?

19:54.676 --> 19:58.412
You-- you right
about yourself, ex--

19:58.446 --> 19:59.413
but--

19:59.447 --> 20:01.248
Ha ha ha!

20:01.283 --> 20:02.416
Here it is.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.619
This one slipped my mind.

20:04.653 --> 20:07.989
You can build with me

20:08.023 --> 20:10.125
an immortality machine

20:10.159 --> 20:12.160
to give you what I got

20:12.194 --> 20:14.062
from the remnants
of my spacecraft.

20:14.096 --> 20:15.396
So, yeah.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.932
- Wow.
- You gonna be immortal.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.534
You gonna be immortal.

20:19.568 --> 20:22.436
Daddy, when are we gonna get
the remnants?

20:22.471 --> 20:24.205
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

20:24.239 --> 20:25.573
(gasps)

20:25.607 --> 20:28.667
Gonna get them tomorrow
during work.

20:30.178 --> 20:32.146
Hey, you got anything
that looks like

20:32.180 --> 20:34.581
parts of a crashed spaceship?

20:34.616 --> 20:35.882
- Dead mom?
- Mm-hmm.

20:35.917 --> 20:39.019
Mm-hmm.
Right this way.

20:39.053 --> 20:40.654
(applause)

20:40.688 --> 20:42.555
Jordan--
So, Jordan, hey,

20:42.590 --> 20:45.257
you think we should say
good-bye?

20:45.291 --> 20:47.125
- What'd your mom say?
- Oh, jeez.

20:47.159 --> 20:49.226
(laughter)
Good night, everybody.

20:49.261 --> 20:52.962
- Good night.
- Whoo!

20:52.997 --> 20:55.964
