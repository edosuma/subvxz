(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:25.682 --> 00:27.252
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:27.252 --> 00:28.651
(This was filmed in accordance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.)

00:28.651 --> 00:29.982
(Staff ensured the animals' safety in the filming of this drama.)

01:26.742 --> 01:29.111
- Dad. - Yes?

01:30.042 --> 01:34.182
Why is your company called IM?

01:36.412 --> 01:39.151
It's because I named it after you.

01:40.751 --> 01:42.451
My name is Woo In.

01:42.891 --> 01:43.962
What?

01:45.692 --> 01:48.832
What are your English initials?

01:49.462 --> 01:52.102
W and I.

01:52.662 --> 01:56.501
That's right. Now have a look.

01:58.001 --> 02:00.102
Your initials are...

02:01.542 --> 02:04.042
W and...

02:05.811 --> 02:07.882
I. Right?

02:08.182 --> 02:09.951
- Yes. - Turn it upside-down.

02:13.822 --> 02:14.992
Tada.

02:16.391 --> 02:19.021
Wow. You're the best, Dad.

02:19.521 --> 02:22.162
If we look at it like this,

02:22.861 --> 02:24.701
it's Woo In, isn't it?

02:24.931 --> 02:26.261
And like this...

02:26.532 --> 02:29.072
- Your company's name, IM. - That's right.

02:45.981 --> 02:47.122
You good girl.

02:51.521 --> 02:54.162
Let's see your drawing. Oh, wow.

02:55.192 --> 02:56.891
You did pretty well.

02:57.931 --> 02:59.632
It's huge.

03:00.461 --> 03:02.331
It says "IM".

03:10.681 --> 03:12.042
Cha Woo In.

03:12.042 --> 03:13.042
(Episode 2)

03:13.211 --> 03:15.081
There's something suspicious.

03:17.951 --> 03:20.921
Rather than Captain Cha, right now,

03:20.921 --> 03:23.652
shouldn't IM Defence be your priority?

03:24.391 --> 03:25.461
IM?

03:26.622 --> 03:28.592
- No Tae Nam's company? - Yes.

03:28.662 --> 03:32.261
Just like you, I can't stand being curious.

03:32.261 --> 03:34.701
So I did some research.

03:40.542 --> 03:43.072
IM Defence was established 30 years ago.

03:43.072 --> 03:44.882
It was a small defence industry company.

03:44.981 --> 03:48.511
At the time, it was the cream of the crop of its kind...

03:48.611 --> 03:49.882
and did very well.

03:50.352 --> 03:53.722
They have since expanded to aircraft, engines, robots,

03:53.722 --> 03:56.092
and even security systems.

03:56.322 --> 03:57.891
It got pretty massive.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.731
If the core business is defence, do they have ties with the military?

04:02.831 --> 04:04.002
Of course they do.

04:04.431 --> 04:07.201
No Tae Nam's mother is...

04:08.532 --> 04:10.372
General No Hwa Young.

04:12.141 --> 04:14.141
The female general who broke through the glass ceiling.

04:14.141 --> 04:17.011
The first woman in Korea's military history to earn two stars.

04:17.011 --> 04:19.981
She has a killer gaze that is said...

04:19.981 --> 04:22.481
she uses instead of a gun to kill.

04:22.912 --> 04:25.051
General No Hwa Young is his mother?

04:25.051 --> 04:27.181
(Who is General No Hwa Young?)

04:28.522 --> 04:29.621
How interesting.

04:31.191 --> 04:34.262
How is a young kid like No Tae Nam a chairman?

04:36.262 --> 04:40.561
The stable company's stocks plummeted when they leaked...

04:40.561 --> 04:44.171
military secrets, manipulated the market, and someone embezzled.

04:44.272 --> 04:46.772
The previous chairman was arrested.

04:47.102 --> 04:49.241
- They fell into a trap. - Yes.

04:49.741 --> 04:54.082
A hedge fund sold off the stock and IM went into legal management.

04:54.082 --> 04:58.082
That's when IM Defence was bought at a bargain price...

04:58.082 --> 04:59.582
and the buyer happened to be...

04:59.582 --> 05:00.821
No Tae Nam?

05:00.991 --> 05:02.991
Yes. But there's talk that...

05:02.991 --> 05:05.421
he's just a puppet.

05:07.361 --> 05:09.532
That means there's someone in the background.

05:11.501 --> 05:13.931
The previous owner. What happened after he lost the company?

05:14.272 --> 05:18.371
That part of the story is incredibly shady.

05:20.602 --> 05:23.371
(Chairman Cha Ho Cheol's mysterious accident)

05:29.952 --> 05:33.551
Chairman Cha who was on trial passed away.

05:34.321 --> 05:36.392
(IM Defenderâ€™s Chairman Cha Ho Cheol Dies in Car Crash)

05:36.392 --> 05:39.222
The chairman died at the scene,

05:39.361 --> 05:43.332
and a relative in the passenger seat was gravely wounded and unconscious.

05:43.731 --> 05:46.131
So? What's the shady part?

05:46.402 --> 05:49.801
The prosecutor in charge of the case...

05:50.171 --> 05:51.772
was Yong Moon Gu.

05:53.602 --> 05:56.171
The sentence can't change just because he's rich.

05:56.642 --> 05:59.212
Then what use is the law when it should be impartial?

05:59.611 --> 06:02.782
Prosecution promises Cha Ho Cheol will be punished severely...

06:02.782 --> 06:06.352
as he caused the public to distrust the system.

06:06.522 --> 06:08.092
Are all the charges true?

06:08.251 --> 06:09.722
Do you admit to everything?

06:09.722 --> 06:12.522
Yong Moon Gu was just a low-level prosecutor,

06:12.522 --> 06:14.962
and everyone talked about how he'd caught a huge fish.

06:15.092 --> 06:17.262
No Tae Nam and Yong Moon Gu?

06:19.032 --> 06:22.571
That's the same trick I used to destroy Gusan Bank's president.

06:22.902 --> 06:24.042
"Trick"?

06:24.301 --> 06:27.941
One. Target an enemy your business could do without.

06:28.272 --> 06:31.342
Two. Create a non existent crime and frame them for it.

06:31.342 --> 06:34.782
Three. Ruin the target's reputation before the trial.

06:34.782 --> 06:38.352
Four. No Tae Nam swoops in,

06:38.421 --> 06:41.551
and Yong Moon Gu enjoys the rake-off.

06:43.352 --> 06:45.092
You're right. Because as soon as...

06:45.092 --> 06:46.361
Yong Moon Gu quit the prosecutors' office,

06:46.361 --> 06:49.332
he founded Law and One.

06:49.662 --> 06:51.061
I bet No Tae Nam funded it.

06:51.801 --> 06:53.561
A compensation for getting him IM Defence.

07:23.032 --> 07:25.501
But what about Captain Cha...

07:25.501 --> 07:27.262
are you suspicious of?

07:27.501 --> 07:28.801
(4th Infantry Division)

07:28.801 --> 07:29.832
Call it a hunch.

07:31.071 --> 07:33.142
One that I can feel from deep inside my bones.

07:35.342 --> 07:37.241
It's the after-effect of being mindful of others...

07:37.241 --> 07:38.241
since I was a kid.

07:39.481 --> 07:41.082
I guess it's the result of long-term training.

07:44.181 --> 07:45.621
Even though I can't quite put my finger on it,

07:46.582 --> 07:48.522
I can sense that something is off.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.491
Having doubts about someone...

07:55.332 --> 07:57.162
means that trust is being built.

08:02.472 --> 08:05.671
Once you get past the long, dark tunnel of doubt,

08:06.402 --> 08:09.671
those doubts turn into unbreakable trust.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.251
However, even trust that has been strongly built...

08:14.852 --> 08:17.212
can shatter like glass once cracks appear...

08:18.782 --> 08:20.551
in the form of doubts.

08:22.821 --> 08:24.522
And what has been shattered...

08:25.361 --> 08:26.792
becomes the blade.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.762
(Se Na)

08:30.832 --> 08:33.731
- Woo In. - Se Na, how are you holding up?

08:34.501 --> 08:36.102
I have a favour to ask.

08:37.071 --> 08:38.542
I'll meet you at the hospital.

08:41.912 --> 08:45.882
(A few days ago)

08:47.512 --> 08:48.612
Se Na.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.482
I...

08:55.551 --> 08:58.662
You're the only one I could call.

09:03.431 --> 09:04.601
It's all right.

09:06.402 --> 09:07.831
Nothing will happen.

09:08.201 --> 09:11.642
I'm here, so everything will be all right.

09:20.951 --> 09:24.252
Hello, I'm Detective Do Soo Kyung of Violent Crimes Unit One.

09:24.652 --> 09:26.081
I'm Cha Woo In.

09:26.321 --> 09:28.451
Could you tell me what happened?

09:28.451 --> 09:30.321
According to Ms. Han's statement,

09:30.421 --> 09:32.522
she appears to have been sexually assaulted.

09:35.132 --> 09:37.561
Did she name her attacker?

09:37.561 --> 09:38.831
Not yet.

09:39.002 --> 09:41.331
She knows him but is too afraid to identify him.

09:42.132 --> 09:43.532
Was there anything else?

09:44.571 --> 09:46.902
It seems that she was drugged,

09:47.471 --> 09:50.242
and the assault took place at Club Cartel in Gangnam.

09:51.542 --> 09:53.982
Did you say "Cartel"?

09:54.252 --> 09:55.252
Yes.

09:57.652 --> 10:00.951
Se Na says you're a close friend and a prosecutor.

10:01.421 --> 10:03.252
I'm a military prosecutor.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.061
A military prosecutor? Which division...

10:06.061 --> 10:08.292
I'll have her admitted to a hospital first.

10:09.032 --> 10:11.431
Of course. If you let us know where...

10:11.431 --> 10:13.201
I'll be in touch.

10:14.671 --> 10:15.772
Sure.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.681
(Shinnuri Hospital)

10:42.032 --> 10:43.292
Se Na.

10:47.902 --> 10:50.201
I think I made a mistake.

10:50.402 --> 10:52.042
Reporting to the police, I mean.

10:55.441 --> 10:57.272
There's a video of me.

10:58.341 --> 11:00.912
Those scumbags have me on video.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.421
What am I going to do if they blackmail me with it?

11:07.892 --> 11:09.992
If they upload it online...

11:10.752 --> 11:12.961
Just thinking about it is driving me crazy.

11:17.461 --> 11:18.601
Se Na...

11:24.272 --> 11:26.301
Woo In, I have a favour to ask.

11:27.711 --> 11:29.311
You're a military prosecutor, right?

11:30.242 --> 11:33.512
Won't they be afraid of you if you tell them who you are?

11:42.152 --> 11:45.792
The video... is in my possession.

11:48.431 --> 11:51.132
- What? - No one will ever see it.

11:51.762 --> 11:53.762
I haven't even told the police about it.

11:55.071 --> 11:57.132
How can you have the video though?

11:57.132 --> 11:59.042
I can't tell you that just yet.

11:59.441 --> 12:01.772
I will though, when the time is right.

12:11.451 --> 12:15.522
What's important right now is that both of us...

12:15.591 --> 12:17.622
need this video.

12:19.022 --> 12:20.762
You need it too?

12:20.961 --> 12:23.162
There can't be a trial without it.

12:27.902 --> 12:29.801
But the choice must be yours.

12:31.671 --> 12:34.201
You can choose to bury it forever...

12:34.542 --> 12:36.811
or make those punks pay for what they did.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.581
I want it to stay buried.

12:47.382 --> 12:49.152
I don't even want to think about it again.

12:53.122 --> 12:54.191
Right.

12:55.992 --> 12:59.461
If that's what you want, then that is what we'll do.

12:59.831 --> 13:01.471
If I don't cause any trouble,

13:03.002 --> 13:05.002
they will leave me alone, won't they?

13:07.571 --> 13:09.242
I'll protect you,

13:10.372 --> 13:11.841
so don't you worry about a thing.

13:17.482 --> 13:20.951
K-pop artist Allen's concert that was to be held tomorrow...

13:20.951 --> 13:23.091
was suddenly cancelled.

13:23.292 --> 13:24.522
According to his agency,

13:24.522 --> 13:27.931
Allen fell off the grid and hasn't been in contact.

13:28.091 --> 13:29.931
A flood of complaints from fans...

13:45.042 --> 13:47.482
- Yes? - Sir, did you watch the news?

13:48.412 --> 13:51.012
- The news? - Allen is missing.

14:05.431 --> 14:06.601
The person you have reached is unavailable.

14:06.601 --> 14:07.801
Please leave a message...

14:13.542 --> 14:14.642
The person you have reached is unavailable.

14:14.642 --> 14:16.142
What's gotten into him?

14:22.382 --> 14:23.512
The person you have reached is unavailable.

14:23.512 --> 14:24.652
Please leave a message...

14:30.051 --> 14:31.522
Has he still not been in touch?

14:31.862 --> 14:33.321
He's not picking up.

14:34.392 --> 14:36.931
As you know, falling off the grid is his jam.

14:36.931 --> 14:38.862
The upcoming concert must've piled the stress on.

14:39.101 --> 14:41.272
He's been off the grid at times,

14:42.431 --> 14:44.272
but he always takes your calls.

14:45.042 --> 14:47.671
Right. He knows how I can get.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.811
Then, this is something different.

14:51.782 --> 14:54.482
Something happened at Cartel that night, didn't it?

14:55.551 --> 14:57.652
Why would you mention the darn club?

14:58.551 --> 15:00.282
This has nothing to do with it.

15:05.022 --> 15:07.492
Every mess of yours that I have cleaned up...

15:07.492 --> 15:09.492
was done before the light was shed upon it.

15:09.591 --> 15:12.032
Why else would I call myself your legal fixer...

15:12.032 --> 15:13.601
and not your legal representative?

15:14.402 --> 15:17.032
I clean things up before they get dragged into court.

15:20.742 --> 15:21.841
Gosh.

15:23.012 --> 15:25.042
No wonder you were a prosecutor in the special investigations unit.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.912
You really know how to squeeze someone.

15:27.841 --> 15:29.752
I didn't mind it when it was for my sake,

15:30.551 --> 15:33.122
but it stinks to be on the other end of it.

15:34.051 --> 15:37.652
This has to be about the girl you were with that day.

15:45.801 --> 15:49.071
Don't tell me it was once again recorded.

15:49.632 --> 15:50.632
Darn it.

15:50.632 --> 15:52.542
How much of my personal life must you know about?

16:02.652 --> 16:05.221
Hey, she scratched you.

16:05.851 --> 16:06.921
What?

16:09.392 --> 16:11.622
Darn it!

16:12.492 --> 16:13.662
Are you out of your mind?

16:17.961 --> 16:21.372
Don't you know that he has a concert lined up?

16:21.732 --> 16:24.171
A fan wouldn't dare leave a mark on his face.

16:24.532 --> 16:26.841
Some fan you are, you useless cow!

16:29.441 --> 16:31.912
- That hurt. Darn it. - Gosh.

16:32.311 --> 16:33.341
Stop.

16:35.581 --> 16:36.711
Stop it.

16:39.152 --> 16:41.321
Hey. She's getting the look.

16:41.321 --> 16:43.392
Give me your phone. We have to film her now.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.022
Darn it.

16:49.232 --> 16:50.691
- Are you getting it? - Yes.

17:00.441 --> 17:02.711
Did you use Allen's phone on purpose?

17:02.711 --> 17:05.242
You said not to leave evidence on my phone as much as possible.

17:05.242 --> 17:06.612
You're always nagging me.

17:08.551 --> 17:10.782
You shouldn't have started to begin with.

17:12.622 --> 17:15.051
Are we good? I told you everything.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.992
You take care of it now.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.272
So Allen took off with the video.

17:30.432 --> 17:32.272
I'll look for him first.

17:33.301 --> 17:35.071
Tell him to do it.

17:35.571 --> 17:37.712
(Chief Executive Officer No Tae Nam)

17:38.482 --> 17:39.581
Who do you mean?

17:39.881 --> 17:42.081
That soldier boy that took care of that special treatment case.

17:42.351 --> 17:43.581
He seems pretty good.

17:47.881 --> 17:50.351
What? Is that a problem?

17:53.861 --> 17:55.692
A military prosecutor is still a prosecutor.

17:56.161 --> 18:00.101
It is not good for Do Be Man to get involved in your private matters.

18:00.331 --> 18:02.202
So try it.

18:06.141 --> 18:08.141
I need to have him do something soon.

18:08.472 --> 18:09.811
A private matter.

18:13.081 --> 18:14.641
That's 67.

18:15.182 --> 18:16.512
Arms up please.

18:17.212 --> 18:19.422
Okay, put them down.

18:20.151 --> 18:22.792
That's 107... My gosh, you're big.

18:23.192 --> 18:24.252
Okay.

18:27.361 --> 18:28.462
That's 105.

18:29.762 --> 18:32.462
I can create a masterpiece.

18:33.801 --> 18:35.401
When do you need it?

18:35.631 --> 18:39.401
I have a feeling I'll need it pretty soon.

18:39.542 --> 18:42.341
- I'm ordering it in advance. - Okay.

18:42.341 --> 18:45.282
- May I get your autograph... - Hey! Oh my gosh.

18:45.282 --> 18:46.712
Sorry.

18:46.881 --> 18:47.942
I apologize.

18:48.182 --> 18:51.851
- He's a customer. - He's totally my dream guy.

18:51.952 --> 18:53.022
Hello, Mr. Yong.

18:53.282 --> 18:55.151
Come to my office right now.

18:55.522 --> 18:56.591
Yes, sir.

18:57.922 --> 19:00.661
(Managing Partner Yong Moon Gu)

19:02.032 --> 19:04.762
I ran right over. Is there an urgent matter?

19:05.101 --> 19:06.331
Have you heard of Allen?

19:08.232 --> 19:09.502
He's a singer.

19:12.002 --> 19:13.172
Allen.

19:13.841 --> 19:15.442
I've heard of him.

19:15.712 --> 19:16.871
He's missing.

19:17.272 --> 19:19.841
No, it's too soon to conclude that.

19:20.411 --> 19:22.081
Let's say he can't be reached.

19:24.081 --> 19:27.121
There's an apartment where Allen hangs out with his friends.

19:27.182 --> 19:29.492
- Look there first. - Yes, sir.

19:32.391 --> 19:34.891
Don't you want to know why I want you to find him?

19:34.891 --> 19:39.002
Why don't I ask why you called me instead of the police...

19:39.161 --> 19:41.571
- about a missing person? - That's right.

19:41.732 --> 19:43.801
A soldier simply follows orders.

19:43.871 --> 19:45.002
We don't question them.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.371
Above all else... No.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.042
I don't care to know at all.

19:57.982 --> 20:00.851
I'm dying to know something, Sang Ki.

20:01.222 --> 20:04.922
What is it? I know you can't handle being curious even for a second.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.262
Get me everything you can find on a singer.

20:07.422 --> 20:08.532
His name is Allen.

20:08.831 --> 20:09.932
Allen?

20:10.091 --> 20:11.702
The Allen who's huge right now?

20:11.762 --> 20:14.762
His private life. People close to him, especially girls.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.331
Everything he did in the past month.

20:17.532 --> 20:21.002
Okay. But why do you sound...

20:21.002 --> 20:22.611
excited to me?

20:22.611 --> 20:26.482
I think that Allen kid is No Tae Nam's guy.

20:26.841 --> 20:29.012
Yong Moon Gu is hiding it from me,

20:29.351 --> 20:30.782
but my instincts are never wrong.

20:31.051 --> 20:33.121
I'll dig into him right away.

20:33.121 --> 20:35.222
- You have my loyalty. - Sure.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.722
Complete loyalty.

20:41.932 --> 20:44.861
It was a big mess last night because someone reported a fire.

20:45.401 --> 20:48.061
We evacuated the residents and the fire department came.

20:48.061 --> 20:49.631
It was total mayhem.

20:49.772 --> 20:50.901
A fire?

20:51.232 --> 20:53.871
I don't know if it was a prank or a mistake,

20:54.071 --> 20:56.242
but all the night shift workers went to resolve the matter.

20:56.242 --> 20:58.141
When we got back...

20:58.141 --> 20:59.841
The security videos were deleted.

21:00.111 --> 21:02.712
That's right. All but one.

21:03.081 --> 21:04.182
Where's that?

21:06.581 --> 21:09.321
Camera 8 in the hallway on the 20th floor.

21:09.321 --> 21:10.692
May I see it?

21:10.851 --> 21:13.762
Sorry, but that will be difficult.

21:14.061 --> 21:17.962
Since a singer lives there, unless there's a special reason...

21:22.732 --> 21:25.272
You can decide whatever reason you feel is appropriate.

22:12.081 --> 22:13.151
Blood.

22:22.232 --> 22:23.331
This is it.

22:24.091 --> 22:25.262
The redhead.

22:40.341 --> 22:42.081
Are you looking for anything in particular?

22:42.782 --> 22:45.121
I'm looking for a gift for a supervisor at work.

22:45.422 --> 22:46.682
What would you recommend?

22:46.821 --> 22:48.792
- A supervisor? - Yes.

22:48.851 --> 22:52.391
I guess he's going to become your boyfriend in the future.

22:53.391 --> 22:55.032
That's offensive.

22:55.732 --> 22:56.932
I'm sorry.

22:57.891 --> 23:01.101
I'll find you something useful but stylish.

23:01.202 --> 23:02.272
Okay.

23:10.141 --> 23:11.272
This looks good.

23:16.212 --> 23:19.821
You want me to take this?

23:20.851 --> 23:24.891
Hey. This isn't a gift, it's a bribe.

23:25.361 --> 23:28.432
Why would I bribe a superior officer who's leaving soon?

23:28.962 --> 23:30.992
It's to thank you for saving me during that interrogation.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.131
My pride won't let me be indebted to someone.

23:33.262 --> 23:37.532
Of course, it's only right to show your feelings with objects.

23:37.831 --> 23:39.871
But this is a bit...

23:40.042 --> 23:44.012
I didn't know what you liked, so I just chose it myself.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.381
You guessed correctly.

23:49.282 --> 23:51.381
I'm going for marksmanship training.

23:51.581 --> 23:53.551
Hey, wait. Cha.

23:53.752 --> 23:55.692
Take this watch with you.

23:58.762 --> 24:02.462
She gave you a watch. A pretty expensive watch.

24:03.091 --> 24:06.532
This is excessive for a gift from a subordinate to a superior.

24:07.762 --> 24:11.401
This is what you give to a future husband, not even a boyfriend.

24:11.401 --> 24:14.101
So... What's going on here? Let's all think for a moment.

24:16.141 --> 24:19.081
That's right. You think the same thing I do, don't you?

24:19.081 --> 24:21.712
I'm getting itchy. It's starting to itch right here.

24:21.712 --> 24:23.212
What's this? Is love in the air?

24:23.512 --> 24:25.121
Love is not in the air.

24:25.121 --> 24:27.151
You're itchy because you don't bathe.

24:28.282 --> 24:31.621
- Out of nowhere? - You go too. Go shower.

24:32.292 --> 24:33.422
Hands off.

24:35.022 --> 24:36.192
Hey, Cha!

24:36.292 --> 24:37.561
He's getting angry.

24:38.361 --> 24:40.331
I was right. Totally.

24:41.871 --> 24:42.972
Cha Woo In.

24:44.772 --> 24:45.901
Where are you going?

24:46.202 --> 24:48.841
Aren't you going to the range? I'm going to go too.

24:49.672 --> 24:50.712
Yes, sir.

24:51.942 --> 24:54.682
I'd like to give you a gift on par with the watch.

24:55.111 --> 24:56.182
What do you need?

24:57.252 --> 24:59.482
If we give and take, the gift becomes meaningless.

24:59.752 --> 25:02.091
Plus, I don't need anything.

25:02.851 --> 25:03.922
Really?

25:04.722 --> 25:06.692
Gosh. Goodness.

25:07.591 --> 25:09.561
I won't see you again once you're discharged.

25:09.861 --> 25:12.502
Just wear it on you at all times like it's a part of you...

25:12.502 --> 25:14.561
and cherish it. That's all I want.

25:25.282 --> 25:27.881
(Military Penitentiary)

25:47.601 --> 25:48.772
I'm not someone...

25:50.401 --> 25:53.942
who can be told to come and go as you please.

25:53.942 --> 25:57.512
As you can see, I can't go out myself.

25:57.512 --> 26:00.212
Do you even know what I do for a living?

26:00.512 --> 26:04.351
I hear you make jerks who are too thick-skull to talk to...

26:04.452 --> 26:06.182
beg to talk it out.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.182
That's right.

26:09.651 --> 26:12.222
You're well-informed even behind bars.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.792
How did someone like you end up in here?

26:19.901 --> 26:21.232
You know this rat, don't you?

26:27.472 --> 26:28.712
Definitely.

26:29.442 --> 26:33.341
There's a famous phrase. "One's mortal enemy."

26:34.042 --> 26:36.182
I don't know or care about such things.

26:36.182 --> 26:38.212
It means two people are enemies...

26:38.621 --> 26:43.121
that cannot breathe let alone live under the same sun.

26:43.121 --> 26:45.051
That's why you're the one for the job.

26:45.321 --> 26:48.522
This is your chance to end the karma.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.732
It's called karma when we fight each other.

26:55.032 --> 26:56.371
It was completely one-sided,

26:56.371 --> 26:58.742
and it would be unfair to leave it at that.

26:59.972 --> 27:01.042
The thing is,

27:01.442 --> 27:04.811
the whole flow is a bit bothersome.

27:05.111 --> 27:08.982
What are you about to say that you're being so hesitant?

27:09.282 --> 27:12.051
I want Do Be Man dead.

27:25.462 --> 27:27.401
(Pistol 25m Target)

27:32.472 --> 27:34.202
My gosh.

27:34.871 --> 27:36.542
If I had a few more months left,

27:36.542 --> 27:38.682
I could've taught you well.

27:39.141 --> 27:40.542
How unfortunate.

27:41.141 --> 27:43.182
You're right. It's such a pity.

27:48.051 --> 27:50.252
Are you always so dry?

27:51.391 --> 27:53.992
Oh? Whatever people say?

27:57.492 --> 28:00.532
That's fine. It's not like you're going to war.

28:01.131 --> 28:02.871
Let's approach this as a sport.

28:05.442 --> 28:08.002
The key point of every sport is posture.

28:08.341 --> 28:11.371
One. Relax your upper body.

28:11.571 --> 28:13.712
Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width.

28:15.411 --> 28:17.752
Slightly bend your knees and elbows...

28:17.752 --> 28:19.422
and make an isosceles triangle.

28:20.752 --> 28:23.351
That way you minimize the muzzle movement...

28:23.351 --> 28:25.492
and absorb the recoil.

28:25.992 --> 28:27.022
That's it.

28:28.321 --> 28:31.391
The most important point is the second one.

28:32.762 --> 28:35.631
Imagine someone's face and put it on the target.

28:36.772 --> 28:38.841
Someone you'd love to shoot at.

28:49.811 --> 28:50.851
Now shoot.

28:59.492 --> 29:02.661
(Pistol 25m Target)

29:06.061 --> 29:08.532
(Pistol 25m Target)

29:14.972 --> 29:16.042
Just a moment.

29:35.992 --> 29:38.292
I want Do Be Man dead.

29:42.631 --> 29:45.071
- People are listening. - Scaredy-cat.

29:46.141 --> 29:48.641
This isn't your average prison.

29:53.042 --> 29:56.651
Even so, how am I to kill a prosecutor?

29:56.651 --> 29:58.682
Do this job well,

29:58.881 --> 30:00.881
and we can be fast friends.

30:01.581 --> 30:02.651
What do you say?

30:04.192 --> 30:05.492
Where to, boss?

30:09.262 --> 30:12.502
Gather all the brothers in our chatroom.

30:13.932 --> 30:15.032
All of them?

30:18.331 --> 30:20.002
Yes, boss.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.982
I confirmed that Allen was with his friends at the hideout.

30:29.381 --> 30:32.381
None of the friends he played cards with can be reached.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.422
I checked all the security footage.

30:34.422 --> 30:36.091
Everything else was deleted,

30:36.091 --> 30:39.022
but this was on Security's server and an independent camera.

30:45.462 --> 30:49.002
She was the only visitor then. Do you recognize her?

30:49.301 --> 30:51.502
- Is this it? - There's one more thing.

30:53.742 --> 30:55.942
I took something of Allen's from the scene...

30:55.942 --> 30:57.341
and compared the DNA.

31:02.351 --> 31:03.381
And?

31:04.351 --> 31:05.881
It was Allen's blood.

31:08.321 --> 31:10.551
It's getting a bit out of hand...

31:10.551 --> 31:12.522
to say he's just flying under the radar.

31:13.962 --> 31:15.661
Don't jump to conclusions.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.492
Okay. I won't.

31:21.002 --> 31:22.472
Just find Allen.

31:22.571 --> 31:23.702
I will.

31:24.071 --> 31:27.101
Collecting more information will give me the full picture.

31:36.452 --> 31:39.252
- Hi. - I have the coordinates, Captain.

31:39.252 --> 31:40.252
Where is it?

31:40.252 --> 31:43.121
Have you heard of a club called Cartel?

31:43.121 --> 31:44.222
"Cartel"?

31:49.192 --> 31:51.792
Two days ago, Allen was there with a girl.

31:53.631 --> 31:55.601
Wipe the floor clean.

31:56.032 --> 31:57.772
And set out the chairs properly.

32:01.172 --> 32:02.811
Can I ask you something?

32:03.341 --> 32:04.472
What do you want?

32:04.472 --> 32:07.042
Allen the singer comes here often, doesn't he?

32:07.242 --> 32:08.411
Why do you want to know?

32:08.982 --> 32:13.151
I'd like to know who the girl he brought here two days ago was.

32:13.782 --> 32:15.482
Please leave.

32:15.482 --> 32:18.222
- Wait. Excuse me. - Hang on. Aren't you...

32:18.621 --> 32:21.292
the military prosecutor who charged the pampered soldier?

32:22.391 --> 32:23.692
You recognize me?

32:23.692 --> 32:25.131
Of course I do.

32:25.762 --> 32:27.331
Salute!

32:28.101 --> 32:29.172
At ease.

32:29.871 --> 32:31.032
Captain Do Be Man.

32:31.032 --> 32:34.002
I was in the ops of the Fourth Division,

32:34.002 --> 32:35.871
and I was discharged a month ago.

32:36.341 --> 32:38.811
- Were you? Nice. - Yes.

32:39.411 --> 32:41.381
Get lost. He's a prosecutor.

32:44.351 --> 32:46.722
What would you like to know?

32:49.292 --> 32:52.222
The woman Allen brought over and...

32:53.821 --> 32:56.732
if this person was with them too.

33:01.301 --> 33:05.002
Just as I thought, Chairman No Tae Nam was involved.

33:06.472 --> 33:08.641
Now I just have to find Allen.

33:09.811 --> 33:11.542
Where on earth could he be?

33:49.651 --> 33:52.381
It's time you experienced exactly what you did.

33:56.591 --> 33:59.561
(Emergency Alarm)

34:21.882 --> 34:23.281
Did you have time to think?

34:25.152 --> 34:26.181
What?

34:27.781 --> 34:29.152
What are you saying?

34:31.692 --> 34:33.061
Where are we?

34:33.962 --> 34:35.422
I wonder where you are.

34:37.192 --> 34:39.502
It's a place you'd never have a reason to be.

34:40.002 --> 34:41.002
An army camp.

34:41.002 --> 34:44.672
What? The army? What are you talking about?

34:46.641 --> 34:48.272
How much did your shoulder cost?

34:49.042 --> 34:50.442
A specialized hospital in Gangnam...

34:50.442 --> 34:52.442
said you have multi-directional shoulder instability.

34:52.442 --> 34:54.681
Simply put, you had surgery for a dislocated shoulder.

34:54.681 --> 34:56.411
Go away. Get lost!

34:56.411 --> 34:59.121
Help me! Someone, help!

34:59.121 --> 35:01.022
- Save me! - How much shall I beat you?

35:03.052 --> 35:05.391
As much as the surgery cost or...

35:06.161 --> 35:07.522
as much as you'd make...

35:07.522 --> 35:09.292
in the 18 months you don't have to enlist for?

35:09.732 --> 35:10.862
Darn you!

35:12.701 --> 35:15.632
Save me!

35:16.572 --> 35:18.232
Someone, help!

35:19.342 --> 35:21.002
What's that?

35:21.002 --> 35:23.542
- Until I come back, - Don't come near me!

35:23.811 --> 35:25.011
sleep some more.

35:28.092 --> 35:29.903
I'm so scared.

35:30.381 --> 35:33.012
- Just do better. - Yes, sir.

35:33.012 --> 35:34.912
(Office of the Staff Judge Advocate)

35:35.512 --> 35:36.981
- Salute. - Right.

35:37.522 --> 35:38.582
Wait.

35:41.392 --> 35:44.662
Cha Woo In, your eyebrows...

35:46.531 --> 35:47.662
Is that makeup?

35:48.392 --> 35:49.631
Or is it semi-permanent henna?

35:49.901 --> 35:52.162
Don't tell me they were tattooed on!

35:53.872 --> 35:55.332
They're my natural eyebrows.

35:55.972 --> 35:58.301
Oh, are they?

35:58.401 --> 36:00.472
Then you're good.

36:01.341 --> 36:05.111
However, I can't say the same for your haircut.

36:06.312 --> 36:07.852
It's messy.

36:08.051 --> 36:10.222
If this is about my hairstyle,

36:10.222 --> 36:12.321
I can assure you that it's well above code...

36:12.321 --> 36:13.992
since it accommodates my cap.

36:14.392 --> 36:17.122
Captain Do, what is article 24 of the conduct directory...

36:17.122 --> 36:19.332
issued by the Ministry of National Defence?

36:19.631 --> 36:21.461
One must not disrupt the discipline of the military...

36:21.461 --> 36:23.531
by wearing a wig or dyeing their hair.

36:23.531 --> 36:24.832
Those with short hair must make sure...

36:24.832 --> 36:26.372
that the back hair doesn't reach the collar.

36:26.472 --> 36:28.202
Those with long hair...

36:28.202 --> 36:31.042
must keep it up or in a bun with pins or a net.

36:31.341 --> 36:33.211
So you know the rules!

36:33.211 --> 36:34.941
For someone who does...

36:34.941 --> 36:36.082
Just look.

36:36.242 --> 36:38.281
The back hair is close to touching your collar.

36:38.441 --> 36:40.281
Don't tell me that a military prosecutor...

36:40.381 --> 36:42.182
is keen on violating the rules.

36:42.452 --> 36:46.051
Up until 1988, female soldiers were prohibited...

36:46.051 --> 36:48.051
from giving birth.

36:48.421 --> 36:51.222
Outdated military rules should be amended.

36:52.531 --> 36:53.662
What?

36:54.631 --> 36:55.762
My apologies, sir.

36:56.262 --> 36:57.461
I will get her to correct herself.

36:57.631 --> 36:59.062
But I did nothing wrong.

36:59.671 --> 37:02.171
Let me give you a word of advice.

37:02.432 --> 37:05.642
The military adores those who are smart,

37:05.841 --> 37:08.711
but they loathe those who are smart...

37:08.772 --> 37:10.242
as well as righteous.

37:10.242 --> 37:12.812
Do you know what the worst kinds are?

37:13.111 --> 37:17.082
Those who are smart, righteous, and female.

37:17.082 --> 37:19.082
Soldiers like you,

37:19.651 --> 37:20.792
Cha Woo In.

37:23.222 --> 37:24.461
Unbelievable.

37:32.432 --> 37:35.531
How dare she talk back...

37:35.671 --> 37:38.742
to her direct superior.

37:38.742 --> 37:41.171
That cheeky Cha Woo In!

37:42.512 --> 37:44.042
Sir, come on.

37:44.611 --> 37:46.082
Here you go.

37:47.751 --> 37:49.251
I apologize, sir.

37:49.622 --> 37:51.881
I'll put off my discharge...

37:51.881 --> 37:53.821
if that's what it takes to make a soldier out of her.

37:54.751 --> 37:57.921
No fruit can be born on rotten trees.

37:58.461 --> 38:00.892
Rotten trees should be...

38:01.332 --> 38:02.702
discarded.

38:03.861 --> 38:06.631
If this demeanour of hers continues,

38:07.272 --> 38:09.001
I will have her transferred...

38:09.001 --> 38:12.171
or have her dishonourably discharged following a misconduct charge.

38:12.171 --> 38:14.341
That I will do for sure.

38:19.312 --> 38:20.611
Gosh, that feels good.

38:21.751 --> 38:24.251
Who will do this for me when you're gone?

38:25.022 --> 38:28.392
My mom is enough of a headache for me,

38:30.022 --> 38:32.321
but another female soldier?

38:32.892 --> 38:35.531
They scare me. Gosh, I hate them.

38:35.731 --> 38:38.861
You shouldn't be vocal about those opinions these days.

38:39.102 --> 38:42.432
What you said to Captain Cha could've gotten you into trouble.

38:43.671 --> 38:46.642
Maybe my time in the military is about to get worse.

38:47.042 --> 38:50.542
The new division commander is also a woman.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.082
Who exactly is it?

38:52.412 --> 38:53.781
General No Hwa Young.

38:54.611 --> 38:58.981
The fact that she slayed her star-studded male competitors...

38:59.082 --> 39:02.022
to make it to the rank she's at...

39:02.022 --> 39:04.892
proves that she's not your average woman.

39:08.091 --> 39:11.332
What is it? I bet you're not too happy about it either.

39:11.932 --> 39:12.972
That's not it.

39:13.531 --> 39:14.832
Of course.

39:15.171 --> 39:16.941
Why would you worry when you'll soon be discharged?

39:20.012 --> 39:24.012
Blue mountain... Gosh, that's good.

40:08.792 --> 40:10.722
Just wear it on you at all times...

40:10.722 --> 40:12.421
like it's a part of you and cherish it.

40:12.421 --> 40:13.662
That's all I want.

40:31.542 --> 40:34.452
Collecting more information about Cha Woo In...

40:34.781 --> 40:36.321
will give me the full picture.

40:38.251 --> 40:40.421
(Lawyer Yong Moon Gu)

40:43.492 --> 40:44.562
Yes?

40:44.861 --> 40:48.792
While tracking Allen's whereabouts led me to two women.

40:50.162 --> 40:53.171
One of them is Ms. Red Wig whom I already told you about.

40:53.472 --> 40:55.832
The other one is Han Se Na.

40:56.301 --> 40:58.372
She told the police that she was assaulted...

40:58.372 --> 40:59.742
by Allen and another man...

40:59.742 --> 41:02.171
three days ago at Club Cartel.

41:03.281 --> 41:06.551
- She reported it? - So you knew about her.

41:07.881 --> 41:10.051
- I did. - Then...

41:10.421 --> 41:12.352
who's the guy Allen was with?

41:13.392 --> 41:14.892
That isn't for you to know.

41:17.622 --> 41:19.321
I already know that it's Chairman No.

41:21.531 --> 41:23.531
So you asked a question you already knew the answer to?

41:24.401 --> 41:27.901
Now that I know, wouldn't diving into details...

41:28.071 --> 41:30.102
benefit you as well, Mr. Yong?

41:30.501 --> 41:31.772
This case seems urgent.

41:33.171 --> 41:34.912
Han Se Na dropped all charges...

41:35.272 --> 41:37.881
and is staying at a hospital in Gyeonggi Province.

41:38.281 --> 41:40.611
I'm sure I'll find Allen soon.

41:42.452 --> 41:45.881
I can't do so though without compensation.

41:48.952 --> 41:50.191
What is it that you want?

41:50.421 --> 41:53.091
I'd like to meet Chairman No Tae Nam.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.901
I'll book you a meeting with him tomorrow.

42:01.501 --> 42:04.972
Just remember that it's only a formality.

42:12.082 --> 42:14.781
I'm nervous about you stepping into their world.

42:15.012 --> 42:16.682
Wouldn't it be better...

42:16.682 --> 42:18.551
to mark your place forever in the military?

42:18.722 --> 42:21.091
Thanks to Yong Moon Gu, these past five years...

42:21.251 --> 42:22.961
have been more than lucrative.

42:24.091 --> 42:27.662
It'll only get better from here. You wait and see, Sang Ki.

42:28.091 --> 42:30.102
Hold on. Are you sure though?

42:30.461 --> 42:32.972
I'll be leaving the military with you, so...

42:33.332 --> 42:35.171
You know how good my instincts are.

42:36.301 --> 42:39.501
My fate sees No Tae Nam as the wave crashing toward me,

42:39.501 --> 42:40.812
and I will let myself sail with him.

42:41.211 --> 42:45.312
The others sank and drowned, but I will stay afloat.

42:46.812 --> 42:49.111
- Sir... - The wave is coming my way,

42:49.312 --> 42:50.682
and I will sail on it.

42:50.821 --> 42:52.321
He's watching. That's enough.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.992
I'll wait for you in the car.

43:00.131 --> 43:01.231
Sure.

43:12.642 --> 43:14.512
The suit and everything.

43:15.111 --> 43:17.512
You dolled yourself up nicely for the chairman.

43:18.412 --> 43:19.542
That watch is especially a nice touch.

43:20.682 --> 43:24.151
Oh, this one? It was a gift.

43:25.781 --> 43:26.892
From a girl?

43:27.122 --> 43:29.861
As if I would have the time to get myself a girl.

43:31.662 --> 43:32.861
Shall we?

43:48.211 --> 43:49.341
Wait.

43:51.082 --> 43:52.082
Good boy.

43:54.551 --> 43:56.651
I am military prosecutor Do Be Man.

43:56.852 --> 43:59.722
It is an honour to be invited here, Chairman No.

44:03.162 --> 44:04.622
That's an unusual name.

44:05.992 --> 44:08.832
Hold on a second. It sounds like something I know.

44:09.531 --> 44:10.662
Do Be Man?

44:11.131 --> 44:12.262
Do Be Man...

44:14.231 --> 44:15.472
A Doberman!

44:16.102 --> 44:17.872
My Bolt is a Doberman too.

44:17.872 --> 44:19.001
Aren't you, Bolt?

44:19.001 --> 44:21.512
Doberman has been my nickname since childhood.

44:23.281 --> 44:25.012
I bet you were teased.

44:25.582 --> 44:27.012
They're practically calling you a dog.

44:27.682 --> 44:29.582
That has never been the case.

44:29.981 --> 44:33.251
Anyone who would dare say it was chucked out of the classroom.

44:33.622 --> 44:35.691
Student or teacher alike.

44:42.131 --> 44:43.562
Let's cut to the chase then.

44:43.801 --> 44:45.031
I'm busy today.

44:45.031 --> 44:46.162
Yes, sir.

44:54.611 --> 44:55.912
So let me see.

44:56.142 --> 44:59.582
Your job is to imprison those who evade serving in the military.

44:59.812 --> 45:02.051
If he's in uniform, then he's mine to handle.

45:02.781 --> 45:04.781
Is there anyone you'd like to report?

45:05.082 --> 45:07.222
- I will... - I want to evade conscription.

45:10.591 --> 45:12.262
- Sorry? - Well,

45:13.262 --> 45:15.191
I really don't want to serve.

45:29.742 --> 45:31.582
Spoken like a true chairman.

45:32.742 --> 45:34.412
To flat out ask a military prosecutor...

45:34.412 --> 45:36.012
to get you out of your military obligation.

45:36.522 --> 45:40.251
Sir. I'll look into that separately if you'd like.

45:40.251 --> 45:41.691
Stay out of it.

45:41.892 --> 45:44.461
Let me rephrase that.

45:44.591 --> 45:46.762
I want to see how influential you are...

45:46.762 --> 45:48.731
You want to test me.

45:49.231 --> 45:50.702
Don't cut me off.

45:52.702 --> 45:56.372
If the term "test" turns you off, think of it as an opportunity.

45:56.542 --> 45:59.301
I'm giving you an opportunity to see whether or not...

45:59.301 --> 46:01.142
you'll join me for the long run.

46:02.272 --> 46:04.012
An opportunity.

46:23.461 --> 46:25.461
I don't judge opportunities.

46:26.631 --> 46:28.332
Opportunities will judge me.

46:35.542 --> 46:37.781
Be Man, this isn't something you should answer so lightly.

46:37.781 --> 46:40.481
I'll grab that opportunity tightly.

46:41.082 --> 46:43.551
I didn't expect to get an answer right away like this.

46:43.781 --> 46:45.881
I've never met anyone who surprises me from the get-go.

46:45.881 --> 46:48.852
You're the definition of a soldier, Mr. Doberman.

47:01.071 --> 47:03.872
How could you agree right away like that?

47:04.001 --> 47:05.742
You're a military prosecutor.

47:05.742 --> 47:06.912
Do you have a plan?

47:08.341 --> 47:09.542
A plan?

47:11.281 --> 47:12.481
No, I don't.

47:13.111 --> 47:14.912
You said you'd do it regardless?

47:14.912 --> 47:16.312
It won't be easy.

47:16.751 --> 47:19.821
But since when did I ever go down a path someone else laid down?

47:20.421 --> 47:22.352
The paths were always formed after I passed them.

47:23.392 --> 47:25.861
I'll blaze a trail once again.

47:27.031 --> 47:28.932
- What? - You're not worried...

47:29.691 --> 47:33.472
that I'll find a way, are you?

47:39.671 --> 47:41.341
I'll get going then.

47:55.751 --> 47:58.122
- Let's go. - Good job.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.772
You should've consulted me first.

48:15.912 --> 48:18.611
Are you determined to try my temper lately?

48:18.611 --> 48:21.281
The military isn't that simple!

48:21.281 --> 48:23.012
You want me to go into that military...

48:23.012 --> 48:26.051
and live with rats from who knows where?

48:26.051 --> 48:27.522
Me? No Tae Nam?

48:28.821 --> 48:30.821
That's like telling me to die.

48:37.062 --> 48:39.162
I'll say just one thing.

48:40.671 --> 48:44.542
Your mother will not sit idly by and just watch it happen.

49:04.992 --> 49:06.961
This is the mid-month summary.

49:07.231 --> 49:09.932
Law and One is in the middle of trying 23 cases.

49:10.131 --> 49:12.832
Of them, 17 are civil suits and 5 are criminal cases.

49:12.961 --> 49:14.001
You're not worried...

49:14.602 --> 49:18.272
that I'll find a way, are you?

49:23.412 --> 49:24.781
That ingrate.

49:29.452 --> 49:31.381
Can you take care of this first?

49:33.321 --> 49:34.522
Okay.

49:35.122 --> 49:38.562
Today is the day of the division commander's inauguration.

49:38.562 --> 49:40.762
Make sure to dress neatly...

49:40.762 --> 49:43.231
and attend. Tardiness is unacceptable.

49:43.961 --> 49:44.961
That is all.

49:44.961 --> 49:46.231
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

49:46.301 --> 49:47.671
And you...

49:49.602 --> 49:50.772
Forget it.

49:51.742 --> 49:52.801
Good day, sir.

49:56.242 --> 49:57.742
I just got to the hospital.

49:58.281 --> 50:01.281
How did you find out that Se Na was here?

50:01.751 --> 50:03.352
Do Be Man found her.

50:03.881 --> 50:06.421
That soldier boy really is good.

50:07.091 --> 50:10.361
Given the times, it'll be a big problem if she reports you.

50:10.992 --> 50:13.321
Heed my words. Don't raise your voice.

50:13.992 --> 50:15.832
Yes, sir.

50:25.301 --> 50:26.501
(Patient: Han)

51:09.852 --> 51:10.881
Se Na.

51:13.281 --> 51:14.551
So this was where you were.

51:19.622 --> 51:20.992
I looked all over for you.

51:23.961 --> 51:24.961
Here.

51:26.531 --> 51:27.772
Take them.

51:30.542 --> 51:33.341
I heard you went to the police.

51:36.242 --> 51:40.281
Just because someone steps on you by mistake,

51:40.981 --> 51:43.251
you shouldn't ask for his leg to be chopped off.

51:45.151 --> 51:46.222
Am I wrong?

51:47.222 --> 51:50.921
I'm begging you. Please stop.

51:54.662 --> 51:56.262
Allen's missing.

51:58.631 --> 52:00.772
But he's not the one I'm looking for.

52:03.202 --> 52:04.642
It's that video.

52:07.441 --> 52:09.872
Did you and he plan this? To mess with me?

52:10.742 --> 52:12.812
What are you clenching in your hand?

52:13.682 --> 52:16.611
- What is it? Show me. - Get away or I'll scream.

52:17.781 --> 52:19.821
Where'd you put the video?

52:23.762 --> 52:24.921
Where is it?

52:29.332 --> 52:31.301
The division commander is waiting for you.

52:32.631 --> 52:34.501
Why is my mother here?

52:35.772 --> 52:37.372
Moon Gu, that little...

52:37.872 --> 52:39.542
I'll escort you to the vehicle.

53:08.832 --> 53:09.932
Get in.

53:10.472 --> 53:12.401
Mother, I'll explain.

53:12.401 --> 53:15.412
Mr. Yong told me everything. We can talk on the way.

53:23.352 --> 53:26.151
The ETA at the base is 1441 hours.

53:26.651 --> 53:27.952
We'll go now.

53:37.037 --> 53:39.196
The SJA is watching you. You know that, right?

53:39.937 --> 53:43.207
Your life as a soldier will be tough if you get on his bad side.

53:44.477 --> 53:45.876
I'll keep that in mind.

53:56.816 --> 53:59.256
- Are you all right? - Yes, sir, I am.

53:59.716 --> 54:00.926
Who the heck?

54:09.796 --> 54:11.336
That jerk.

54:14.836 --> 54:16.307
Do you know him?

54:17.707 --> 54:19.106
His name is Seol Ak.

54:19.176 --> 54:21.876
His dad used to steal military supplies...

54:21.906 --> 54:23.716
and send soldiers to his brick factory...

54:23.716 --> 54:25.077
to collect payment for their labour.

54:25.376 --> 54:27.086
So I sent him to prison.

54:28.216 --> 54:30.687
His head got even bigger since then.

54:31.957 --> 54:35.356
It's dangerous. Wait in the car, okay?

54:35.557 --> 54:36.727
Okay.

54:37.327 --> 54:39.327
How about I get some exercise?

54:43.426 --> 54:47.267
I missed you so much, Be Man!

54:48.566 --> 54:51.937
My gosh. Have you been getting facials?

54:51.937 --> 54:53.977
Your skin is glowing.

54:54.847 --> 54:57.117
Are you looking after your dad who's in prison?

54:57.577 --> 55:00.546
You need to be successful if you want to do that.

55:00.617 --> 55:03.086
What should I do with you, punk?

55:03.856 --> 55:06.517
He embezzled for about 20 years as an administrative officer,

55:06.517 --> 55:08.227
so he'll have to serve that long.

55:08.227 --> 55:09.926
My plan is...

55:10.327 --> 55:14.026
to stab you, then visit my old man.

55:15.267 --> 55:18.597
Yes. The best you can do as a son is visit.

55:18.997 --> 55:23.236
No, wait. Would it be even better to see him as a fellow inmate?

55:45.626 --> 55:49.526
For someone who dresses well, you're so old-school.

55:50.097 --> 55:53.367
Autonomous cars have reached level four, High Automation...

55:54.367 --> 55:55.707
and you brought lumber?

55:56.137 --> 55:59.307
Artificial intelligence can change the world,

55:59.437 --> 56:01.977
but it can never replace us.

56:01.977 --> 56:03.077
That's right.

56:04.946 --> 56:07.747
Brothers! Don't just stand there.

56:07.917 --> 56:09.316
This soldier boy.

56:09.816 --> 56:12.816
- Take him out! - Yes, boss!

56:16.827 --> 56:17.926
Die!

56:20.156 --> 56:21.327
Not bad.

56:22.267 --> 56:23.327
That's it!

56:27.307 --> 56:28.437
Darn it.

56:38.847 --> 56:40.816
- Come over here. - Come at me.

56:43.917 --> 56:45.086
Shoot!

57:02.236 --> 57:03.336
Go on!

57:12.046 --> 57:13.216
This is expensive.

57:18.917 --> 57:20.086
Come on!

57:55.986 --> 57:58.897
That hurt. Give me a moment.

58:00.727 --> 58:02.367
Do Be Man.

58:03.227 --> 58:04.867
It's time to say goodbye.

58:05.196 --> 58:06.637
Goodbye?

58:06.867 --> 58:08.807
I bet you can't even spell that.

58:09.106 --> 58:10.267
What's the time?

58:16.807 --> 58:20.716
Hey. Captain Cha, stay in the car. I'm almost done here.

58:21.086 --> 58:24.187
Get back in the car. I won't be long.

58:27.287 --> 58:29.126
What is she doing?

58:33.497 --> 58:35.066
What is it, soldier lady?

58:35.196 --> 58:37.026
Will you whip us or something?

58:37.026 --> 58:38.736
In exactly 20 minutes,

58:38.937 --> 58:40.736
my new division commander will be inaugurated.

58:41.367 --> 58:43.167
I really hate being late.

58:45.207 --> 58:47.176
- What a show-off. - Do you?

58:48.077 --> 58:49.906
- I will let her whip me. - Will you?

58:50.617 --> 58:52.676
Go on. Whip me.

59:00.086 --> 59:03.586
Come on. How hard can a girl hit?

59:04.196 --> 59:05.256
Have a go.

59:15.966 --> 59:18.376
Who is this kid?

59:19.276 --> 59:20.546
Take her down!

59:47.906 --> 59:49.037
Cha Woo In.

59:50.106 --> 59:51.876
I was right to be suspicious.

59:56.606 --> 59:57.716
Come here.

1:00:23.606 --> 1:00:24.676
Let go!

1:00:31.546 --> 1:00:32.676
Shoot.

1:01:07.446 --> 1:01:08.986
Where did you learn to do this?

1:01:09.117 --> 1:01:12.816
Is it weird to see a soldier beat up some thugs?

1:01:17.126 --> 1:01:18.296
You drive.

1:01:18.656 --> 1:01:20.926
After all that exercise, I need a rest.

1:01:21.597 --> 1:01:22.696
Got it.

1:01:55.597 --> 1:01:59.497
Cha Woo In. What are you?

1:01:59.497 --> 1:02:00.637
Are you ready to go?

1:02:11.017 --> 1:02:13.417
(Military Prosecutor Doberman)

1:02:23.626 --> 1:02:25.926
I'm after Cha Woo In's true identity.

1:02:26.026 --> 1:02:29.426
I'm convinced I need you to be part of my plan.

1:02:29.526 --> 1:02:32.167
You dare ask a military prosecutor to get you out of serving?

1:02:32.167 --> 1:02:33.937
I really don't want to enlist.

1:02:33.937 --> 1:02:37.267
Punishing people over one tiny mistake is what we do here.

1:02:37.267 --> 1:02:38.336
What are you saying?

1:02:38.336 --> 1:02:39.906
I really like how he does things.

1:02:39.906 --> 1:02:41.946
He's not like you Moon Gu who tiptoes around my mom.

1:02:41.946 --> 1:02:43.776
Cops are everywhere.

1:02:44.247 --> 1:02:45.647
He needs a warning.

1:02:45.647 --> 1:02:47.887
- Stop the car, punk! - Shoot.

1:02:47.986 --> 1:02:49.617
Do you have a guilty conscience?

1:02:49.617 --> 1:02:51.316
Do you or do you not?
