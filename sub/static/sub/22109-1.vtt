WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:06.707
* The Serfsons.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.077
*

00:33.701 --> 00:36.937
Aw, water soup again?

00:36.970 --> 00:39.540
(squawks)
Now it's crow soup.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.742
Ooh, I call an eye!

00:41.775 --> 00:43.544
Me, two!
Me, three!

00:43.577 --> 00:45.713
And Maggie gets the beak.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.748
(squeals happily)

00:48.782 --> 00:52.220
(neighs)
(all gasp)

00:52.253 --> 00:55.256
Your hovel got
in the way of my horse.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.391
Kiss his hooves
in apology.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.059
Mm! Mm! Mm!

00:59.093 --> 01:01.229
(chuckles): Oh, please,
forgive us, noble steed.

01:01.262 --> 01:05.065
Mm! Mm! Our nostrils are not
worthy of your mighty stench.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.401
Mm! Mm! Are those
new horseshoes?

01:07.435 --> 01:09.403
Oh, they look good on you!

01:09.437 --> 01:10.438
Mm! Mm! Mm!

01:10.471 --> 01:11.739
(neighs)

01:11.772 --> 01:13.607
(disgusted whinny)

01:15.609 --> 01:17.077
Lousy nobles!

01:17.111 --> 01:19.079
We serfs are starving,
while they're feasting

01:19.113 --> 01:21.081
and jousting
and posing for tapestries

01:21.115 --> 01:22.916
where they're friends
with a unicorn.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.752
As if any unicorn
would like them.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.920
Unicorns like nice people--
I'm a nice person.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.757
Young lady, that kind of
talk is anti-feudalist,

01:29.790 --> 01:31.425
and I won't have it!

01:31.459 --> 01:34.061
Without feudalism, we
wouldn't have this hovel,

01:34.094 --> 01:37.165
our bountiful filth,
or my awesome buboes.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.900
Ooh-hoo. I'll lance you later.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.435
(panting heavily)

01:41.469 --> 01:43.003
(inhaling deeply)

01:43.036 --> 01:45.406
Bart! They just stuck
new severed heads up

01:45.439 --> 01:47.074
on the city walls!

01:47.107 --> 01:48.942
Oh! Can we go, Ma?
Can we? Can we?

01:48.976 --> 01:51.078
That's a lovely idea.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
Oh. And we can bring my mom.

01:53.147 --> 01:56.284
I hope she's doing okay
in her new nursing home.

01:56.317 --> 01:59.119
(snoring, wheezing)

01:59.153 --> 02:01.189
Which one is your mom's web?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.123
GRAMPA:
Son, is that you?

02:03.157 --> 02:04.392
No.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.428
MRS. BOUVIER:
Ah, you ruined my nap!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.129
Just like you ruined
my daughter's life.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.731
That's her.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.470
They didn't skimp
on the tar.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.307
That's the secret
to long-lasting heads.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.809
Ooh, there's
Ned Flanders!

02:21.842 --> 02:24.312
It's always nice when
you know someone.

02:24.345 --> 02:28.048
Those are the kind of sideburns
I was saying you should grow.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.383
Hmm...

02:29.417 --> 02:31.051
Pretty sharp.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.654
Pretty, pretty sharp.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.289
See how the heads
of rich people

02:35.323 --> 02:37.225
get the tallest pikes
with the best view?

02:37.258 --> 02:38.492
It's so unfair.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.494
I told you
to lay off feudalism.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.330
It's the only system we know.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.333
We have no choice about it,
and therefore it's the best.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.001
The system is designed
to keep us down.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.337
That's not true.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.071
In a great country
like ours,

02:51.104 --> 02:54.508
a poor girl can grow up
to be anything she wants--

02:54.542 --> 02:57.645
a wife or a harlot
and... that's it.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.382
I wanted to be a harlot,
but it's all who you know.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.016
It's never too late.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.386
Everyone is somebody's
weird fetish.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.989
Mom. What's wrong
with your skin?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.991
It's blue,
and ice-cold.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.527
This could be a
serious disease.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.029
Homer, she needs
medical attention.

03:16.063 --> 03:19.032
Pretty,
pretty sharp.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.535
(bells tolling)

03:21.569 --> 03:23.704
It's never easy to say this.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.873
You've got...
Genital Snerfs.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.875
SNERFS:
* La, la, la-la, la-la

03:27.908 --> 03:29.543
* We love our new home.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.746
Doc, is there any way to
control occasional flare-ups?

03:32.780 --> 03:33.881
Nope.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.384
Yeah!
Yay!
Yippee!

03:36.417 --> 03:37.718
(groans)

03:37.751 --> 03:39.453
Now, what have we here?

03:39.487 --> 03:42.022
Progressive
frozen-mortification!

03:42.055 --> 03:44.925
This can only be the bite

03:44.958 --> 03:46.394
of an Ice Walker!

03:46.427 --> 03:47.861
An Ice Walker?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.863
Mom, how did
this happen?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.699
Oh, I dated a ravenous wight

03:51.732 --> 03:53.901
who abhors the warmth
of the living.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.969
And?
He got fresh.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.306
I'm sorry, baby.
I know I screwed up.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.308
But you got to give me
another chance.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.909
I love you.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.912
She's 900 years younger
than you, you pervert.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.715
I like 'em young,
that ain't no crime.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.550
(giggling)

04:09.583 --> 04:11.819
Is my mom
gonna be okay?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.921
Mm, I'm sorry,
but a week from now,

04:13.954 --> 04:16.089
your mother
will be frozen solid.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.326
No! No, that can't be.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.761
She's barely into
her hag years.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.931
All you can do is give her
leeches for the pain.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.233
Here's an organizer.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.670
So... so there's nothing
we can do to save her?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.605
Mm... well,
there's one treatment.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.908
MARGE: All we have to do
is buy this amulet.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.777
My mom is saved!

04:36.810 --> 04:38.278
Yeah...

04:38.312 --> 04:40.113
but a hundred GP?

04:40.147 --> 04:42.616
I mean, that's more than a
tenth-level fighter makes

04:42.650 --> 04:44.652
in an entire campaign.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.187
Don't worry, we'll
figure it out.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.458
Hey, sweet young thang.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.860
What time they cuttin' you down?

04:52.893 --> 04:55.295
Ooh, baby!

04:55.329 --> 04:56.864
(humming a tune)

04:56.897 --> 04:59.299
(grunts, continues humming)

04:59.333 --> 05:02.436
Okay, we just need to come up
with a hundred gold pieces.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.605
How much do we have
in our savings?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.640
Hmm... let me think.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.643
There's that thing...
(mumbling unintelligibly)

05:09.677 --> 05:11.479
(smacking lips, mumbling)

05:11.512 --> 05:13.146
What are savings?

05:13.180 --> 05:14.982
Well, then we can sell
our possessions.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.617
The pig. The spoon.
(oinks)

05:16.650 --> 05:17.818
The gelatinous cube

05:17.851 --> 05:19.387
has to be worth
something.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.821
DISCO STU VOICE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.823
Is this because
of what happened to the cat?

05:22.856 --> 05:26.627
I told him not to nap on me.
So... that's on him.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.397
Look, honey,
I love your mom.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.132
As crones go, she's tops.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.167
But does it make sense--

05:34.201 --> 05:38.005
I mean total sense--
to spend all that money

05:38.038 --> 05:42.175
so a really old lady
can get a little bit older?

05:42.209 --> 05:43.844
This is my mom's life!

05:43.877 --> 05:47.014
This family will do whatever
it takes to keep her alive!

05:47.047 --> 05:48.682
Is that understood?

05:48.716 --> 05:49.917
Of course. Of course.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.151
Good.
Good.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.453
Good.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.355
All I'm saying is...

05:55.389 --> 05:56.424
(grunting)

05:56.457 --> 05:58.492
(oinks)
Homer Serfson,

05:58.526 --> 06:01.862
you are the most selfish jerk
in the entire Tri-Kingdom Area!

06:01.895 --> 06:04.031
I should have listened
to that witch

06:04.064 --> 06:06.333
and married
my twin brother, Markery.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.202
Always here if
you need me, sis.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.271
Get lost, freak!
She chose me!

06:11.304 --> 06:13.541
You get that money
to save my mom,

06:13.574 --> 06:16.710
or never set foot
in this hovel again!

06:16.744 --> 06:19.680
Good things come
to those who wait.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.914
Oh...

06:25.986 --> 06:27.888
Is Marge still sore
at you, Homer?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.524
Yeah. It's not like I
want to kill her mother.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.860
I just want to let
her die from neglect.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.395
(groans) If I don't get
the money for that amulet,

06:35.429 --> 06:37.765
I'll be sleeping
on the iron couch.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.236
Now, let's see here.
"An urgent message

06:43.270 --> 06:45.739
for Milady Gwendolyn Partz."

06:45.773 --> 06:47.608
Uh, Milady Partz?

06:47.641 --> 06:50.110
Hey, has anyone seen
Milady Partz?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.412
Ah, come on,
somebody grab Milady Partz!

06:52.446 --> 06:54.782
That depends-- how
big is your dowry?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.416
(all laughing)

06:57.918 --> 07:00.554
You little craven, if I
ever get my hands on you,

07:00.588 --> 07:03.591
I'm gonna slice you open and
drain all of your humors:

07:03.624 --> 07:06.259
blood, black bile,
yellow bile...

07:06.293 --> 07:07.761
"...and phlegm."

07:07.795 --> 07:09.497
(both laughing)

07:12.866 --> 07:14.434
(strained grunt)

07:16.003 --> 07:16.970
(yelps)

07:17.004 --> 07:18.639
Aah!

07:18.672 --> 07:20.674
Okay, break's over.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.811
(yelling,
grunting)

07:25.846 --> 07:27.447
Uh, Lord Montgomery?

07:27.481 --> 07:30.450
I've had some unforeseen
family medical expenses,

07:30.484 --> 07:34.287
and I was wondering, could I
get an advance on my salary?

07:34.321 --> 07:36.957
Uh, but first, can
I have a salary?

07:36.990 --> 07:39.092
(chuckles)
Peasants.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.995
Serfson, you've pushed
that wheel around and around

07:42.029 --> 07:44.698
for 20 years--
did you ever wonder why?

07:44.732 --> 07:47.034
Mostly I just push it.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.502
Have you ever noticed
that the wheel

07:48.536 --> 07:50.003
isn't hooked up
to anything?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.006
(gasps)
The rumors were true!

07:53.040 --> 07:55.643
But your work does produce
something very special--

07:55.676 --> 07:57.177
human misery--

07:57.210 --> 07:59.346
which, when collected,
ground into a powder

07:59.379 --> 08:03.717
and snorted, gives rich people
tiny wings that do nothing.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.486
So if you help me,
it reduces my suffering,

08:06.520 --> 08:09.389
which means less wing powder
for my betters.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.958
I'm glad we
had this talk.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.826
But I really need
the money...
Flit-flit.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.228
Thank you
for your time.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.631
Mm...

08:17.665 --> 08:18.866
(knocking)

08:20.167 --> 08:23.303
(groans)
Hi, Azzlan.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.905
Marge, my child.

08:24.938 --> 08:28.876
I've come to offer solace
in this difficult time.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.711
You mean convert me
to your religion

08:30.744 --> 08:32.713
when I'm at my
most vulnerable?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.982
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.051
I'm just here to ask you
an important question.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.087
Have you heard the news?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.489
Yes, yes.
I will be saved.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.825
Thanks so much
for stopping by.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.661
I'm just going to leave you with
this literature, praise God...

08:47.695 --> 08:49.496
I can't go home
and face your mom

08:49.529 --> 08:51.732
without the money
for that amulet.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.233
In here.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.236
Do you have your
lucky lead nugget?

08:56.269 --> 08:57.771
Always.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.406
A lead-lick a day

08:59.439 --> 09:02.109
keeps the doctor a-blah...

09:04.377 --> 09:06.246
*

09:06.279 --> 09:07.447
(wind whistling)

09:12.552 --> 09:14.622
(gasps) Gold.
Sweet, sweet gold!

09:14.655 --> 09:17.090
Why didn't you ever tell us
you could do magic?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.760
Because if the king finds
out, he'll take me away

09:19.793 --> 09:22.195
and force me to be one
of his evil wizards!

09:22.229 --> 09:24.031
You necromancing nitwits!

09:24.064 --> 09:26.934
I wanted an all-seeing eye,
not this!

09:26.967 --> 09:28.435
(sniffing)

09:28.468 --> 09:31.271
No daughter of mine is gonna
end up in the hex trade.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.440
(nose sneezes)
Now, let's go
buy that amulet.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.876
And don't worry,
mum's the word.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.145
Did you say "The Word"?

09:38.178 --> 09:39.479
Hmm? Ah? Hmm?

09:39.512 --> 09:40.781
(Lisa and Homer groan)

09:40.814 --> 09:42.983
Hi, Azzlan.
Hi, Azzlan.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.384
(grunts)

09:44.417 --> 09:45.552
12-nothing.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.621
My serve.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.624
You know, eventually,
you're gonna run out of us.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.626
I said, my serve.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.729
Mom, I've got
a surprise for you.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.497
Thanks to who?

09:57.530 --> 10:00.634
I said it when I was 11,
and I'll say it now.

10:00.668 --> 10:03.170
You're the greatest husband
in the world.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.073
Mm...
(gasps)

10:06.106 --> 10:07.741
Where'd a dirt-poor
loser like you

10:07.775 --> 10:09.843
get all the gold
for that?

10:09.877 --> 10:11.144
(chuckles):
Oh, well...

10:11.178 --> 10:13.080
let's just say...

10:13.113 --> 10:15.282
I strangled a leprechaun.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.985
I'm not wearing that.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.987
But without it,
you'll die.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.489
Fine by me.
What?!

10:22.522 --> 10:24.658
I want to die.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.993
(groans):
Oh, typical!

10:26.026 --> 10:27.661
"I want to live,
I want to die."

10:27.695 --> 10:30.330
Just make up your mind--
they're both terrible.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.767
Oh, I've lived a full life.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.003
I saw a drawing of an ocean,

10:36.036 --> 10:39.272
I watched my daughter
marry an ogre.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.842
I am not an ogre.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.610
My father married an ogre

10:43.643 --> 10:47.247
after my mother was eaten
by a different ogre.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.183
You're my mom.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.053
I can't bear the thought
of saying good-bye.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.692
(sighs)

10:58.726 --> 11:01.061
You want me to live, I'll live.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.832
(ringing)

11:07.334 --> 11:08.902
Let's celebrate!

11:08.936 --> 11:10.704
I'll roast a hobbit for dinner.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.139
Mmm...

11:12.172 --> 11:13.741
Bet you a packet

11:13.774 --> 11:16.143
of South Farthing pipe weed
she picks me, Gaffer.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.878
Hush now, lad.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.547
The big folk will choose
who's tastiest and no mistake.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.249
Ow! Ooh!

11:22.282 --> 11:25.218
Hey! How do you know
you got them from me?

11:25.252 --> 11:26.653
SNERFS:
We miss you!

11:26.686 --> 11:27.988
We miss you, too!

11:28.021 --> 11:29.156
Love you!

11:29.189 --> 11:30.323
Love you more!

11:30.357 --> 11:32.159
(Snerfs giggling)

11:32.192 --> 11:35.095
Ow, ow, ow!

11:35.128 --> 11:38.265
Hmm. Is it really so bad
for Grandma if she dies?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.533
Won't she spend eternity
in the Fields of Bliss?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.335
(grunts)
SNAKE: Ow!

11:42.369 --> 11:45.405
Yeah. We're all going
to the Fields of Bliss,
Ow!

11:45.438 --> 11:48.341
where the days are passed
in frolic most joyous.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.744
BART:
Just frolicking? That's it?

11:50.778 --> 11:53.413
HOMER: Sometimes, you wave
ribbons through the air.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.082
But mainly, frolicking.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.349
Doesn't that get old?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.951
Did I mention the ribbons?

11:57.985 --> 11:59.286
'Cause there's ribbons.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.121
Fields of Bliss? Nonsense.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.423
The afterlife is an
eternity of slaughtering

12:03.456 --> 12:05.625
and being slaughtered
by your enemies.

12:05.658 --> 12:06.860
Oh, yeah.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.862
You're both wrong.
After death,

12:08.896 --> 12:11.765
you spend all day counting
Goblin Jesus's money.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.034
(chuckles) And it
better all be there.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.368
71 mermaids.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.137
Some where the fish
is the top part.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.305
(laughs):
Top.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.539
Mushrooms.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.707
Everywhere, mushrooms.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.775
(grunts)

12:21.809 --> 12:23.543
Frolicking and ribbons!

12:23.576 --> 12:27.547
Yeah, but what if
after we die, that's it?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.149
We're just gone?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.383
(all gasping)

12:30.417 --> 12:31.819
So just poof?

12:31.852 --> 12:34.554
Really? Poof, and then
just super nothing?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.123
Mm-mm?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.725
Well, it's clean.
I'll give you that.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.294
(rocking chair squeaking)

12:44.331 --> 12:45.966
Oh, yeah.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.168
This is way better
than death.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.970
Come on, Mom.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.472
There's so many things
we can say to each other now.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.074
Oh, really?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.909
Okay, then, say them.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.077
I'm waiting.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.979
Oh. Um...

12:59.012 --> 13:00.613
Well... (chuckles)

13:00.647 --> 13:01.915
What about you guys?

13:01.949 --> 13:04.417
What do you want
to ask your grandma?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.086
I got nothing.
I'm gonna take a stroll

13:06.119 --> 13:07.787
and enjoy the golden age
of cleavage.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.289
Lisa?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.791
Um... uh...

13:11.825 --> 13:13.827
Oh! Well, Grandma,

13:13.861 --> 13:16.296
tell us of your
most ardent swain.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.665
I dated a shape-shifter once.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.001
I thought I could
keep him from changing.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.302
I was wrong.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.504
Love is a fairy tale!

13:24.537 --> 13:26.439
Oh. Uh...

13:26.473 --> 13:30.177
Every moment with her
is a precious gift.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.445
Yes. Yes, it is.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.114
All that matters
is that we're a family

13:34.147 --> 13:35.648
and we're together.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.186
(all gasping)

13:43.823 --> 13:45.959
Sorcerer-intendent
Chalmers.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.029
Your daughter has been detected
using witchcraft.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.364
Under the Magic:
The Gathering Act,

13:51.398 --> 13:55.135
she is hereby
property of the crown.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.804
What? My daughter
isn't a magician.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.907
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
but she is.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.543
Yes, the moment that
she transmuted lead into gold,

14:03.576 --> 14:05.378
our palantirs--
they just went bananas.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.380
I've never seen palantirs
go so bananas.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
It was the only way.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.718
I just didn't want you
to be sad about Grandma.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.721
(gasps) Oh, no.
This is all my fault.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.656
Don't blame
yourself, honey.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.892
We're all at fault
for doing whatever it takes

14:18.926 --> 14:20.593
to make you happy.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.062
(gasps)
Help!

14:22.095 --> 14:23.563
You can't nap my kid!

14:23.596 --> 14:24.998
That's kidnapping!

14:25.032 --> 14:26.433
Toenail Imprisonum!

14:29.402 --> 14:30.603
D'oh!

14:30.637 --> 14:32.105
Lisa's magic?

14:32.139 --> 14:34.207
Maybe I'm magic, too!

14:34.241 --> 14:35.708
Abra-carumba!

14:35.742 --> 14:37.911
Yeah, just grab a stick
and say a funny word.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.047
Yeah, that's not
insulting to us at all.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.714
Please don't
take my daughter.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.284
She was only trying
to save her grandmother.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.219
She sounds like
a wonderful kid.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.655
Now please say good-bye
to her forever.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.793
Take a peasant,
leave a peasant.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.935
She's gone.
Lisa's gone.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.771
Clip me out of here, Marge.
I'm gonna rescue Lisa

15:04.804 --> 15:07.374
if I have to kill every
noble in that castle.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.876
But Dad, serfs can't
rise up against nobles.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.578
You'd be attacking
the system itself.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.281
And nobody
loves feudalism more than you.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.117
Son, feudalism
is a beautiful vision.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.618
The Bill of No Rights.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.887
One person, no vote.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.123
But I'm willing
to betray all that

15:23.156 --> 15:24.791
to get my daughter back.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.427
Hey, you mind if
I dissolve those?

15:27.460 --> 15:28.928
Uh, just checking.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.965
Better to ask.
Better to ask.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.967
Peasants, peons,

15:34.001 --> 15:35.969
and distinguished beggars!

15:36.003 --> 15:37.937
(chortling)

15:37.971 --> 15:41.641
Aren't you tired of the nobles
taking the wheat we sow,

15:41.674 --> 15:43.443
the yarn we spin,

15:43.476 --> 15:45.312
and the wine we steal

15:45.345 --> 15:47.981
from travelers
we murder on the road?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.649
They even take our children.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.818
And not just
the worthless Barts,

15:51.851 --> 15:54.121
but the magical Lisas.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.090
(all murmuring agreement)

15:57.124 --> 16:00.260
If we can put
a moon-spangled hat on a man,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.795
why can't we
kill a bunch of rich jerks

16:02.829 --> 16:05.132
and take their stuff?!

16:05.165 --> 16:06.599
(all cheering)

16:06.633 --> 16:08.835
(grunting)

16:08.868 --> 16:10.103
(grunts)
(squeals)

16:10.137 --> 16:11.538
(grunts)

16:13.873 --> 16:15.542
(clamoring, shouting)

16:18.211 --> 16:19.779
(shouting stops)

16:19.812 --> 16:22.282
How are we
going to get over these walls?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.117
Walls...

16:24.151 --> 16:25.985
cannot stop us.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.955
The trees will fight with you.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.724
We will never
forget your sacrifice.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.826
Sacrifice?

16:33.860 --> 16:36.529
We could have torn down

16:36.563 --> 16:39.699
the castle walls
in five minutes.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.401
(chuckles)

16:41.434 --> 16:43.570
Trees can't talk, silly.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.007
(clamoring, shouting)

16:48.041 --> 16:50.009
(yelling, grunting)

16:50.043 --> 16:51.578
*

16:53.780 --> 16:55.848
(pig squealing)

16:55.882 --> 16:57.317
LISA:
Mom!

16:57.350 --> 17:00.320
Dad! Help!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.555
Milhouses,
save your girlfriend!

17:02.589 --> 17:04.491
ALL:
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

17:04.524 --> 17:06.025
Okay, no, um...

17:06.059 --> 17:09.496
I'm just a friend
who is a girl.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.698
ALL:
It's something to build on.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.435
(dragon roars)

17:15.468 --> 17:19.106
You peasants are a drag-on
the economy.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.241
Oh! I get it.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.610
Because he's riding a dragon!

17:24.711 --> 17:25.912
Aah!

17:25.945 --> 17:29.416
My love for wordplay
is undiminished!

17:30.617 --> 17:32.552
(gasps) Aah!
(screaming)

17:32.585 --> 17:35.222
Oh, no!
We're losing.

17:36.756 --> 17:37.924
We need to talk.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.093
Now?
Yes, now.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.595
It's time for me to... go.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.897
(gasps)
Life is about moving forward.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.067
Girls want to be women,
women want to be mothers,

17:48.101 --> 17:50.036
mothers want to be grandmas,

17:50.069 --> 17:53.273
and grandmas
want to know what comes next.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.242
But what if
I'm not ready?

17:55.275 --> 17:58.911
I wouldn't leave you if I didn't
know you'll be all right.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.816
Okay, Mom.
I understand.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.787
Maybe I was born a peasant,

18:07.820 --> 18:10.089
but I'm going out
an ice queen.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.825
(gasps)

18:34.214 --> 18:37.817
(groans)

18:37.850 --> 18:39.519
Ouch.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.989
Now we won!

18:43.022 --> 18:45.792
(all cheering)

18:45.825 --> 18:47.360
Oh!
Mm.

18:47.394 --> 18:50.463
My mom gave her life
to save ours.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.365
Take comfort, Marge.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.134
Now she's in
the Fields of Bliss.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.637
No, she's in
Goblin Money Heaven.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.207
The afterlife is snakes
chewing your eyes,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.874
but it feels good.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.510
SNERFS:
This is our heaven!

19:03.543 --> 19:05.212
(sighs):
Oh.

19:05.245 --> 19:08.515
Or, as long as Grandma
lives on in our hearts,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.517
then she's
never truly gone.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.018
Until we die.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.486
Then it's like
she never existed.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.989
And, someday,
no one will remember you.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.158
Or anybody.

19:19.192 --> 19:22.028
All is well--
the nobles are defeated,

19:22.061 --> 19:23.563
the dragon is dead,

19:23.596 --> 19:24.731
and I've got a daughter

19:24.764 --> 19:27.066
who can turn lead into gold!

19:27.099 --> 19:30.503
Ooh. Um, actually,
I can't anymore.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.206
Dragon fire is the
source of all magic.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.041
And Grandma killed
the last one.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.877
Everything wondrous and
extraordinary about our world

19:37.910 --> 19:39.712
is going to fade.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.348
(all gasp)

19:41.381 --> 19:44.217
But maybe now we can use science
to improve our world.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.918
With new technologies,

19:45.952 --> 19:48.855
we can put an end
to poverty and disease.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.357
Sure, it'll be hard work,

19:50.390 --> 19:52.425
but far more rewarding
than waving your hand

19:52.459 --> 19:54.727
over a rock
to change it into gold.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.062
(chuckles)
I mean...

19:56.095 --> 19:58.097
Please come back, magic!

20:00.099 --> 20:02.068
Live, damn you, live.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.636
(dragon groans)

20:05.472 --> 20:08.275
(all cheer)
I am risen!

20:08.308 --> 20:09.742
But what about science?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.578
Oh, sweetie, who would

20:11.611 --> 20:13.746
want to live in a world
without magic?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.448
It would be so boring.

20:15.482 --> 20:18.251
People would have to make up
fantasy stories...

20:18.285 --> 20:20.420
Most of them poorly-
written pretenses

20:20.453 --> 20:22.589
for explicit sex
and violence.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.625
...just to escape
the tedious real world.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.060
Oh. That does sound awful.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.196
Look! The dragon is
burning our village.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.233
(laughs)
I love our life.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.251
* Dry your tears

20:52.285 --> 20:55.087
* A journey's end

20:55.121 --> 20:58.257
* The saga's done

20:58.291 --> 21:01.093
* We part as friends

21:01.127 --> 21:05.432
* We must away

21:05.465 --> 21:07.767
* We cannot tarry

21:07.800 --> 21:09.936
* The minstrel's burden

21:09.969 --> 21:13.473
* Is ours to carry

21:13.506 --> 21:15.642
* All other stories

21:15.675 --> 21:18.578
* Will ever pale

21:18.611 --> 21:21.314
* For we have sung

21:21.348 --> 21:26.018
* The perfect tale.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.194
