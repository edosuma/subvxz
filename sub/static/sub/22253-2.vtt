00:16.577 --> 00:18.746
Yeah, you'll
never guess who's here.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.498
Think '90s.

00:20.581 --> 00:24.252
No, BoJack Horseman from Horsin' Around.

00:24.336 --> 00:26.087
No, I mean, he got a little fatter,

00:26.171 --> 00:27.672
but it's definitely him.

00:27.755 --> 00:30.258
He looks really sad. It's hilarious.

00:31.425 --> 00:32.969
Get over here now.

00:36.681 --> 00:38.474
I told you, I don't know where it is.

00:38.557 --> 00:41.060
Don't put things in my
butt if you want them back.

00:42.561 --> 00:45.398
And hold for Princess Carolyn, please.

00:45.481 --> 00:46.607
Thanks, Laura.

Yeah, some agent, you couldn't even get me

00:57.369 --> 00:58.786
in the room for War Horse.

00:58.870 --> 01:00.621
There were, like, ten horses in that movie.

01:00.705 --> 01:02.290
I didn't need to be the warhorse.

Listen, dummy, I want to
make sure you're all set

01:04.167 --> 01:05.751

01:05.835 --> 01:07.962
Is she gonna ask me a
bunch of personal questions?

01:08.046 --> 01:10.340
The woman we're paying
to ghostwrite your memoir?

01:10.423 --> 01:11.799
Yeah, probably.

01:11.883 --> 01:13.676
Okay, all right, there's no need to get...

01:13.759 --> 01:15.845
What, catty? Are you gonna say catty?

01:15.928 --> 01:19.098
- I was not gonna say catty.
- Oh, what were you gonna say?

01:19.182 --> 01:21.851
I was gonna say catty because you're a cat.

01:21.934 --> 01:23.686
Goodbye, BoJack.

01:23.769 --> 01:25.563
Laura, I know you're
listening. You got it, right?

01:25.646 --> 01:27.606
Laura, do not respond
to him. Goodbye, BoJack.

01:27.690 --> 01:30.651
She got it.

01:34.322 --> 01:35.948
Oh, my God. Take another one.

01:36.032 --> 01:38.284
Take another one.

01:40.870 --> 01:43.748
Excuse me, I just wanted you to know

01:43.831 --> 01:46.000
that you ruined someone
else's night tonight,

01:46.084 --> 01:47.877
and I hope you have enough decency

01:47.960 --> 01:50.129
to at least feel a little
bit crappy about it.

01:50.213 --> 01:51.423
Excuse me?

01:51.505 --> 01:53.299
I was actually already in a bad mood,

01:53.383 --> 01:54.884
but I thought maybe for one night,

01:54.967 --> 01:57.929
I could go out to a bar and
try to forget about myself,

01:58.012 --> 01:59.513
but now because of you and your friends,

01:59.597 --> 02:01.849
I feel more self-conscious than ever.

02:01.933 --> 02:03.184
If we were bothering you so much,

02:03.268 --> 02:04.894
why didn't you just leave?

02:04.977 --> 02:07.230
Because I didn't think of
that, and now I feel stupid.

02:07.313 --> 02:08.440
Look, I have a right to be here.

02:08.521 --> 02:09.941
No!

02:10.066 --> 02:12.944
Maybe because you're skinny
and maybe 'cause you're pretty,

02:13.027 --> 02:14.695
you're used to getting away with things,

02:14.779 --> 02:17.073
but I want you to know that your actions

02:17.156 --> 02:19.617
have an effect on others, and I hate you,

02:19.700 --> 02:21.494
and you are a horrible person,

02:21.577 --> 02:24.538
and you not understanding
that you're a horrible person

02:24.622 --> 02:28.626
doesn't make you less of a horrible person.

02:28.709 --> 02:30.669
You think I'm pretty?

02:38.594 --> 02:40.138
Well, that was another in a long series

02:40.221 --> 02:41.889
of regrettable life choices.

Also, you should bring this email with you

04:18.736 --> 04:20.321
because I might not remember
it because I just took

04:20.404 --> 04:22.574
a bunch of horse tranquilizers, ha ha.

Also, please don't put in my book

04:24.075 --> 04:25.868
that I use horse tranquilizers, ha ha.

04:25.951 --> 04:28.162
I just use a small dose to
help me fall asleep at night

04:28.246 --> 04:29.788
and then a much, much larger dose

04:29.872 --> 04:31.332
to get me through the day.

04:31.416 --> 04:32.875
Also, I'm drunk.

Also, I'm alone, so alone, so, so alone.

04:40.466 --> 04:42.218
Does it taste like magenta in here?"

04:42.301 --> 04:43.969
Then I think you fell
asleep on the keyboard

04:44.053 --> 04:46.305
because it just says
the letter "B" 27 times.

Why are you here?

05:03.281 --> 05:06.618
Oh, funny story, I'm
filming a reality show later,

05:06.700 --> 05:10.663
so I thought I'd drop by with
the old tennis ball and chain.

05:10.746 --> 05:13.625
That is neither funny nor a story

05:13.707 --> 05:15.543
nor a reason for you to drop by.

05:15.627 --> 05:17.503
Aw, he just wanted to come over and brag

05:17.587 --> 05:19.046
about his reality show.

05:19.130 --> 05:22.508
Get this, I am starring
in a pilot presentation

05:22.592 --> 05:24.677
for a celebrity reality show.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.970
It's pretty cutting edge, huh?

05:26.053 --> 05:27.472
Yeah, if it's 2003.

05:27.555 --> 05:30.057
Ha ha. Don't tell VH1 that.

Seriously, though, please
don't tell VH1 that.

- Because I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Okay, who's jelly?

05:38.899 --> 05:40.526
No, no, no. It's like a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

05:40.610 --> 05:41.944
It's wordplay.

05:42.027 --> 05:43.529
You may have too forgiving a definition

05:43.613 --> 05:44.656
of the word "wordplay."

05:44.738 --> 05:46.532
Well, it's a working title.

05:46.616 --> 05:49.368
Well, it could be working
harder, and that's wordplay.

05:49.452 --> 05:50.703
How'd you even get in here?

05:50.786 --> 05:51.996

05:54.123 --> 05:56.125
And that is the last
of the Toaster Strudels,

05:56.208 --> 05:57.627
and now my morning is ruined.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.086
Could you guys keep it down, okay?

05:59.170 --> 06:00.921
I'm kind of on a date right now.

06:01.005 --> 06:03.382
In America,

06:03.466 --> 06:06.719
I am actually considered very handsome.

06:08.220 --> 06:09.722
Okay, I'm gonna go get breakfast,

06:09.805 --> 06:11.683
and when I get back, I want
everyone out of my house

06:11.765 --> 06:17.104
except for you and you and...

06:17.188 --> 06:19.357
- Who are you again?
- The girl you had sex with.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.567
Right. You definitely should
have already been gone.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.322
I really shouldn't eat chocolate

06:26.405 --> 06:28.073
'cause it can literally kill me.

06:28.157 --> 06:29.701
Oh, I know.

06:29.783 --> 06:32.662
- But I love chocolate.
- Story of my life.

06:41.212 --> 06:43.172
Hey, excuse me.

06:43.255 --> 06:46.175
Yes, I am BoJack Horseman,
star of Horsin' Around.

06:46.258 --> 06:47.677
Yeah, okay, I don't care.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.261
Those are my muffins.

06:49.345 --> 06:51.096
I'm sorry, I... I don't understand.

06:51.180 --> 06:53.307
Did you bring them into the store with you?

06:53.391 --> 06:55.851
No, but I was going to buy them.

06:55.934 --> 06:57.811
That's the last box,
and I had dibs on them.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.356
Really? You had dibs?

07:00.439 --> 07:02.191
Yeah, dibs.

07:02.274 --> 07:03.568
I just put them down for a second

07:03.651 --> 07:05.152
while I went to the bathroom.

07:05.236 --> 07:06.696
Look, I don't even want the muffins.

07:06.779 --> 07:08.614
I was just looking at
them, but I got to say,

07:08.698 --> 07:10.866
if you put muffins down,
they're not your muffins.

07:10.949 --> 07:12.326
So what, I was supposed to take them

07:12.410 --> 07:13.952
into the bathroom with me?

07:14.036 --> 07:15.829
You didn't even put the muffins in a cart.

07:15.913 --> 07:16.997
You just left them out here.

07:17.081 --> 07:19.124
Yeah, in the produce section.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.586
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed
to be in the produce section.

07:21.669 --> 07:24.296
That wasn't a sign to you that
maybe someone else had dibs?

07:24.380 --> 07:26.048
Look, I don't want to get
into a whole thing here.

07:26.131 --> 07:28.259
Then give me the muffins.

07:28.342 --> 07:31.345
No, 'cause maybe now I want the muffins.

07:31.429 --> 07:33.305
You think that because
you're a pseudo-celebrity,

07:33.389 --> 07:34.848
normal rules don't apply to you?

07:34.932 --> 07:37.643
Pseudo? Would you say
that to Eric McCormack?

07:37.727 --> 07:39.771
Look, I've had a rough
morning, so I don't need...

07:39.853 --> 07:41.439
You've had a rough morning?

07:41.522 --> 07:44.817
I spent the last ten months...

07:44.900 --> 07:46.652
Hey!

07:46.736 --> 07:49.280
Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya.

07:49.363 --> 07:52.366

this, BoJack Horseman.

07:52.450 --> 07:53.659
Oh, really?

07:53.743 --> 07:56.036
I'm gonna regret buying muffins?

07:56.120 --> 07:59.206
What, have they got a lot
of saturated fat in them?

07:59.290 --> 08:01.292
Oh, man, they do have
a lot of saturated fat.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.335
Why'd I buy these?

08:07.881 --> 08:10.092
Man, I really regret buying those muffins

08:10.175 --> 08:12.428
and then eating them all on the drive home.

08:12.511 --> 08:14.179
Well, my date with Ayako went really well.

08:14.263 --> 08:15.264
Thanks for asking.

08:15.347 --> 08:16.724
I specifically didn't ask,

08:16.808 --> 08:18.309
and I'll thank you to respect

08:18.392 --> 08:19.977
my total lack of interest
in your personal life.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.353
She's hilarious.

08:21.437 --> 08:23.355
I never met a girl who was so curious

08:23.439 --> 08:25.149
about American bank routing numbers.

08:25.232 --> 08:26.400
Still not interested.

08:26.484 --> 08:27.777
Should we get started on the book?

08:27.860 --> 08:29.236
What's your hurry?

08:29.320 --> 08:30.655
What do you guys think I should get Ayako

08:30.738 --> 08:32.657
for our 12-hour anniversary?

08:32.740 --> 08:35.618
She wants a framed picture
of my mother's maiden name.

08:35.701 --> 08:36.994
Okay, let's get to work.

08:40.956 --> 08:42.416
Let's start at the beginning.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.418
What was your childhood like?

08:44.502 --> 08:46.629
- Normal.
- Normal?

08:46.712 --> 08:49.841
Yeah, it was, uh, normal...
normal childhood stuff.

08:49.923 --> 08:52.009
Here's your omelet.

08:52.092 --> 08:53.385
I'm sorry it's not as good

08:53.469 --> 08:55.304
as the omelets your secretary makes,

08:55.387 --> 08:57.473
but then you're not married
to your secretary, are you?

08:57.556 --> 09:00.601
Well, maybe if my secretary
also refused to get an abortion,

09:00.685 --> 09:01.727
I would be.

09:01.811 --> 09:03.688
Mommy, can I have an omelet?

09:03.771 --> 09:05.606
You're the birthday boy.

09:07.191 --> 09:08.693
Normal childhood,

09:08.776 --> 09:11.362
and then just get right
into the big, famous part.

09:11.445 --> 09:13.155
Look, if you're not ready
to talk, we can wait.

09:13.238 --> 09:14.782
I am ready to talk.

09:14.866 --> 09:16.367
Why wouldn't I want to
talk about my parents?

They're so normal. That's crazy.

Stop being so crazy, crazy.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.748
Why are you calling me crazy?

09:22.832 --> 09:25.668
Okay. Was your father...

me to watch MSNBSea, so no.

09:49.983 --> 09:52.570
No, I'm not watching MSNBSea right now.

09:52.653 --> 09:54.405
Yeah, well, Hamlet, you
might want to turn it on.

09:54.488 --> 09:55.531
They're talking about you.

09:55.614 --> 09:57.199
Ooh! Good things, I hope.

10:01.537 --> 10:04.081
Our guest via satellite is Neal McBeal,

10:04.206 --> 10:06.625
a naval officer on leave from Afghanistan.

10:06.709 --> 10:07.877
Welcome to the program, Neal.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.044
Thank you, Tom.

10:09.127 --> 10:10.880
Hey, I met this guy.

10:10.963 --> 10:13.173
All Neal wanted when he got home...

10:13.257 --> 10:16.594
and I emphasize, from Afghanistan...

10:16.677 --> 10:20.389
was his favorite brand
of breakfast muffins.

10:20.472 --> 10:22.558
When he went to the
supermarket and called dibs

10:22.641 --> 10:23.851
on the last box...

10:23.935 --> 10:25.728
Well, tell us what happened, Neal.

10:25.811 --> 10:29.899
BoJack Horseman, from the
'90s sitcom Horsin' Around,

10:29.982 --> 10:31.943
refused to respect my dibs.

10:32.025 --> 10:34.486
Have you no shame, BoJack Horseman?

10:34.570 --> 10:36.488
Seen here sneezing at a Christmas party.

10:36.572 --> 10:38.073
Oh, not the sneezing pic...

10:38.156 --> 10:39.825
Why do they always use
the sneezing picture?

10:39.909 --> 10:41.994
In the '90s, we laughed at your antics.

10:42.077 --> 10:44.371
Oh, how we laughed. "Ha ha ha,"

10:44.455 --> 10:46.206
we chortled in rapturous glee.

10:46.290 --> 10:49.835
But when you deny the dibs
called by our men and women

10:49.919 --> 10:52.129
on the frontlines, that
is a sick joke, sir.

10:52.212 --> 10:54.799
A sick, sick joke, indeed,

10:54.882 --> 10:57.134
and you'll forgive me
if I chortle no longer,

10:57.217 --> 10:59.971
for, to me, there is
nothing the least bit funny

11:00.053 --> 11:03.641
about stealing a meal from
Neal McBeal, the Navy SEAL.

11:05.267 --> 11:08.437
Wait, wait, you stole
muffins from a Navy SEAL?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.022
I didn't know he was a Navy SEAL.

11:10.105 --> 11:11.482
I just thought he was
the regular kind of seal.

11:11.565 --> 11:13.567
This is classic Hollywood elitism.

11:13.651 --> 11:15.611
BoJack Horseman thinks
that because he was on TV,

11:15.694 --> 11:17.321
that makes him better than everybody.

11:17.404 --> 11:19.949
Well, guess what, BoJack, now I'm on TV,

11:20.032 --> 11:21.700
so now I'm better than everybody!

11:21.784 --> 11:23.661
That's right, Neal.

11:23.744 --> 11:26.246
You didn't even have
dibs, you stupid sea cow.

11:26.330 --> 11:28.499
You guys think I should call
in and set the record straight?

11:28.582 --> 11:31.084
BoJack, these people feed off controversy.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.253
If you dignify the story with a
response, it's just gonna fan...

11:33.337 --> 11:34.880
I'm now receiving word

11:34.964 --> 11:37.842
that we've got BoJack himself on the phone.

11:37.925 --> 11:39.217
Sorry, stopped listening.

11:39.301 --> 11:40.803
You were ramping up to a "yes," right?

11:40.886 --> 11:42.471
BoJack, what you did today

11:42.554 --> 11:44.640
was a slap in the face of America's heroes.

11:44.723 --> 11:48.101
Will you apologize?

11:48.185 --> 11:50.437
Okay, enough about America's heroes.

11:50.521 --> 11:52.147
Can we talk about dibs?

11:52.230 --> 11:54.232
Because he didn't even really have dibs.

11:54.316 --> 11:55.693
If he had legitimate dibs...

11:55.776 --> 11:57.152
Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.

11:57.235 --> 11:59.530
I hid them in the produce section!

11:59.613 --> 12:01.073
You left them totally out in the open.

12:01.156 --> 12:02.574
That's hiding?

12:02.658 --> 12:03.993
How did you
survive in Afghanistan?

12:04.076 --> 12:05.243
Those are my muffins!

12:05.327 --> 12:07.204
You give me back my muffins!

12:07.287 --> 12:08.831
Hey, guess what, I can't give them back

12:08.914 --> 12:10.041
'cause I ate them all, okay?

12:10.082 --> 12:11.667
Dude.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.711
Hold on, just to be
clear, since this morning,

12:13.794 --> 12:15.713
you ate all the muffins?

12:15.796 --> 12:17.464
Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting

12:17.548 --> 12:19.842
because I have no
self-control and I hate myself.

12:19.925 --> 12:21.719
Is that what you want to hear?

12:21.802 --> 12:23.095
Neal, was it a small container of muffins,

12:23.178 --> 12:24.763
like two to four muffins?

12:24.847 --> 12:27.641
No, Tom, there were a
good deal more than that.

12:27.725 --> 12:29.685
Can you remember exactly how
many muffins were in the box?

12:29.768 --> 12:31.645
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

12:31.729 --> 12:35.440
I ate 12 muffins, and
I didn't even want one!

12:35.524 --> 12:37.693
There's your goddamn news story,

12:37.776 --> 12:41.321
the mystery of my missing
goddamn self-respect!

12:45.450 --> 12:47.160
How'd I come off?

12:47.244 --> 12:50.915
Well, that went slightly
better than the worst

12:51.040 --> 12:55.711
it could have possibly gone, so hooray?

12:59.339 --> 13:00.716
It's not even about the muffins.

13:00.799 --> 13:02.760
Everyone is just out to get me

13:02.843 --> 13:04.636
because I'm famous and so well-adjusted.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.388
Well, at least you've got some privacy.

13:06.471 --> 13:08.974
My boyfriend's filming a
reality show at our house.

13:09.058 --> 13:10.976
If I want to be alone,
I have to go to the roof

13:11.060 --> 13:12.937
because it's the only place they
don't have insurance to film.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.187
You go on the roof?

13:14.271 --> 13:16.189
Yeah, just to get some work done.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.524
Is that really weird?

13:17.608 --> 13:19.276
No, it's adorable.

13:19.359 --> 13:21.445
When I was a kid, I used
to climb onto the roof

13:21.528 --> 13:23.488
with my dad and look at the stars.

13:23.572 --> 13:24.573
What about you?

13:24.656 --> 13:26.450
Were you close with your father?

13:26.533 --> 13:28.744
Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

13:28.827 --> 13:30.495
What is this supposed to be, a lima bean?

13:30.579 --> 13:31.997
It's a heart.

13:32.081 --> 13:34.708
That's some shoddy craftsmanship, son.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.794
- I tried my best.
- No, you didn't.

13:36.877 --> 13:38.420
You slacked off and took the easy way out.

13:38.503 --> 13:39.838
In this world, you can either

13:39.922 --> 13:41.423
do things the easy way or the right way.

13:41.506 --> 13:42.841
You take a boat from here to New York,

13:42.925 --> 13:44.593
you gonna go around the
horn like a gentleman

13:44.676 --> 13:47.345
or cut through the Panama Canal
like some kind of democrat?

13:47.429 --> 13:48.889
Um, the canal?

13:48.973 --> 13:52.601
You go around the horn
the way God intended!

13:52.684 --> 13:53.685
Uneventful.

13:53.769 --> 13:55.896
- What?
- What?

13:55.980 --> 13:57.731
I asked if you were close with your father,

13:57.815 --> 13:59.775
and you sat here in
silence for five minutes

13:59.858 --> 14:02.069
and then said, "Uneventful."

14:02.153 --> 14:04.822
You know what, this is a
really good conversation,

14:04.905 --> 14:06.406
and I definitely want to keep having it,

14:06.490 --> 14:08.450
but I just keep thinking
about the muffins thing,

14:08.533 --> 14:10.494
so maybe we could put a pin in this

14:10.577 --> 14:11.954
thorough deconstruction of my past,

14:12.037 --> 14:13.205
so I can put that other thing

14:13.288 --> 14:14.957
to bed before it spirals out of con...

14:15.040 --> 14:16.625
I had dibs!

14:16.708 --> 14:19.211
- My dibs were on those muffins!
- Your dibs were void!

14:19.294 --> 14:23.048
I spent a year in Afghanistan
making America safer,

14:23.132 --> 14:25.176
and this is the thanks I get?

14:25.258 --> 14:28.261
Really, you, specifically,
made America safer?

14:28.345 --> 14:30.931
Well, BoJack, surely, even you would agree

14:31.015 --> 14:32.016
that the troops are heroes.

14:32.099 --> 14:33.851
I don't agree to that.

14:33.934 --> 14:36.561
Maybe some of the troops are
heroes but not automatically.

14:36.645 --> 14:38.189
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

14:38.271 --> 14:39.982
Most people are jerks already,

14:40.065 --> 14:41.984
and it's not like giving a
jerk a gun and telling him

14:42.067 --> 14:43.318
it's okay to kill people

14:43.401 --> 14:46.030
suddenly turns that jerk into a hero.

14:47.823 --> 14:48.991
What?

14:50.242 --> 14:53.996
Did you just say you
think the troops are jerks?

14:54.079 --> 14:56.331
Oh, you took that the bad way, didn't you?

14:59.210 --> 15:00.585
I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks.

15:00.669 --> 15:01.795
No, no, no.

15:01.879 --> 15:03.964
- The troops are jerks?
- Oh, God.

15:04.048 --> 15:05.465
Most people are jerks already,

15:05.549 --> 15:06.925
and it's not like giving a jerk a gun...

15:07.009 --> 15:09.553
Hello?

15:09.636 --> 15:11.096
Princess Carolyn needs to
talk to you immediately.

15:11.222 --> 15:12.305
Great, put her on.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.141
She's actually just
getting out of a meeting.

15:14.225 --> 15:16.560
- Can you hold for a sec?
- You called me.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.187
♪ When you're walking alone ♪

15:18.270 --> 15:20.647
♪ Because Jellicles are ♪
♪ And Jellicles do ♪

15:20.731 --> 15:22.983
Ugh.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.694
♪ Jellicles would ♪
♪ And Jellicles can ♪

15:25.777 --> 15:27.029
- BoJack.
- Ah!

15:27.112 --> 15:28.739
I'm gonna level with you, honey.

15:28.822 --> 15:32.492
This whole you hating the
troops thing is not great.

15:32.576 --> 15:33.869
I don't hate the troops.

15:33.952 --> 15:36.955
I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.

15:37.039 --> 15:39.416
I just think that he's
wrong about the muffins.

15:39.499 --> 15:41.334
I know, BoJack... just like always,

15:41.418 --> 15:42.878
You're right, and everyone else is wrong.

15:42.961 --> 15:43.962
But if you don't swallow your pride,

15:44.046 --> 15:45.672
this is never gonna let up.

15:45.756 --> 15:47.424
- I know you're stubborn...
- I'm not stubborn.

15:47.507 --> 15:49.093
- I'm proud.
- That's kind of the same thing.

15:49.176 --> 15:50.719
No, it's an important distinction.

15:50.802 --> 15:52.470
Okay, fine. You're not stubborn.

15:52.554 --> 15:54.765
But I'm about to tell you
something very important,

15:54.848 --> 15:57.184
so I want you to listen carefully.

15:57.268 --> 15:59.394
I'm getting another call.

15:59.477 --> 16:00.896
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

16:00.979 --> 16:02.647
♪ When you're walking alone ♪

16:02.731 --> 16:06.193
♪ Because Jellicles are ♪
♪ And Jellicles do ♪

16:07.485 --> 16:10.488
It is now day three of the
great BoJack jerk-off...

16:10.572 --> 16:12.116
Really?

16:12.199 --> 16:14.243
That's the name we came up with for this?

16:14.326 --> 16:17.037
Who came up with that? Was it Randy?

16:17.121 --> 16:19.331
Did Randy come up with that?

16:19.414 --> 16:21.041
Anyway, the former television actor

16:21.125 --> 16:23.085
who hates our troops has not left his home

16:23.168 --> 16:25.045
since his controversial remarks on Monday

16:25.129 --> 16:26.671
about how he hates the troops.

16:26.755 --> 16:28.548
BoJack Horseman makes me sick.

16:28.632 --> 16:31.093
He voiced his opinion, even
though it was unpopular,

16:31.176 --> 16:33.720
and that's the most cowardly
thing a person can do.

16:33.804 --> 16:38.016
After we made love, he covered
himself in sheets like an Arab.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.517
At this very moment,

16:39.601 --> 16:41.853
Congress is voting on
a major education bill

16:41.937 --> 16:43.480
that could completely restructure the...

16:43.563 --> 16:45.440
Joan, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

16:45.523 --> 16:48.235
but we've got some big news
on the BoJack Horseman front.

16:48.319 --> 16:51.696
It appears that BoJack's Lexus
is coming out of the garage.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.573
This is very big news, indeed.

16:53.657 --> 16:56.285
Any comment on BoJack's
controversial remarks this week?

16:56.368 --> 16:59.496
Uh, nope.

17:00.956 --> 17:02.207
So where are we going?

17:02.291 --> 17:04.416
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

17:04.501 --> 17:05.710
Whoa!

17:05.794 --> 17:07.462
Jeez.

17:07.545 --> 17:11.883
Ayako, hey, I need you to
get me three tickets to Kyoto.

17:11.967 --> 17:13.468
_

17:13.550 --> 17:14.886
_

17:14.970 --> 17:17.181
_

17:17.263 --> 17:20.558
_

17:20.642 --> 17:21.643
_

17:21.726 --> 17:23.103
Hey, I meant I was rich

17:23.186 --> 17:25.896
because I have friends like George Bailey.

17:25.981 --> 17:27.691
_

17:27.773 --> 17:30.819
_

17:30.902 --> 17:32.237
_

17:32.321 --> 17:33.322
Hello?

17:33.405 --> 17:35.324
Well, I'm out of ideas.

17:35.407 --> 17:38.410
We can hide out at my
place while we make a plan.

17:41.788 --> 17:44.416
Yeah, great, just get
me away from the cameras.

17:45.959 --> 17:47.919
Do we really need to be filming this?

17:48.003 --> 17:49.504
It's for my reality show.

17:49.587 --> 17:51.340
You never know when gold's gonna strike.

17:51.423 --> 17:53.258
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

17:53.342 --> 17:54.968
That's why you never know.

17:55.052 --> 17:56.970
BoJack, be nice.

17:57.054 --> 17:58.638
Just pretend they're not there.

17:58.722 --> 18:00.140
Okay. Well, I...

18:00.224 --> 18:01.850
Could you speak up, please?

18:01.933 --> 18:03.810
- I'd like to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:03.894 --> 18:04.895
That's too loud.

18:06.021 --> 18:07.772
I want to fix this as quickly as possible.

18:07.856 --> 18:09.566
I don't care who was right
about the muffins anymore,

18:09.649 --> 18:11.151
even though I was definitely right.

18:11.235 --> 18:13.653
I just want my privacy
back, so I can finish writing

18:13.737 --> 18:16.573
my tell-all memoir, so everyone
will pay attention to me again.

18:16.656 --> 18:18.575
I've already reached
out to the McBeal camp.

18:18.658 --> 18:21.870
He's willing to publicly forgive
you if you publicly apologize

18:21.953 --> 18:24.497
and present to him a box
of muffins as a symbol

18:24.581 --> 18:27.000
of your great admiration
for the American military

18:27.084 --> 18:28.085
and everything they do.

18:28.168 --> 18:29.544
But I ate the muffins.

18:29.627 --> 18:30.670
I know. We got another box.

18:30.754 --> 18:32.130
It's in the cupboard.

18:32.214 --> 18:33.840
Oh, you were saving those? I ate those too.

18:33.924 --> 18:35.884
We've been here for ten minutes!

18:35.967 --> 18:37.761
It's okay, we'll get more muffins.

18:37.844 --> 18:40.097
I'll get the muffins, and they're on me.

18:40.180 --> 18:42.933
I just found out I got
80 bucks in the bank.

18:43.016 --> 18:45.560
I'm helping! Hooray!

18:45.643 --> 18:46.811
So where are we gonna do this?

18:46.895 --> 18:48.563
Do I have to go on MSNBSea?

18:48.646 --> 18:51.233
No, we should do it somewhere
people will actually see it.

18:51.316 --> 18:53.944
Oh, why don't you do it
on Peanutbutter and Jelly?

18:54.027 --> 18:56.571
You can't call a show
Peanutbutter and Jelly

18:56.654 --> 18:57.948
if there's no jelly.

18:58.031 --> 18:59.657
It's a pun.

18:59.741 --> 19:01.452
It's not a pun if it only works one way.

19:01.534 --> 19:02.994
Is this a necessary conversation

19:03.078 --> 19:04.788
to be having right now?

19:04.871 --> 19:06.539
Look, I know tempers are high,

19:06.623 --> 19:08.459
but let's not take it
out on the great title

19:08.541 --> 19:09.834
for my reality show,

19:09.918 --> 19:12.587
which we all agree is really clever.

19:12.670 --> 19:15.466
We can edit this to make
me look smart, right?

19:15.548 --> 19:16.967
♪ Yeah ♪

19:17.050 --> 19:18.260
- * Peanutbutter *
- * Come on *

19:18.343 --> 19:19.761
How's this look? Looks good?

19:19.844 --> 19:22.473
- Okay.
- Marker, sound, speed.

19:22.555 --> 19:24.475
Well, here I am, hanging out

19:24.557 --> 19:26.643
with my good friend BoJack Horseman,

19:26.726 --> 19:28.395
enjoying each other's company,

19:28.479 --> 19:30.772
as we often do.

19:30.855 --> 19:32.732
Yes, this is all very
authentic and natural.

19:33.984 --> 19:35.944
Oh, someone's at the door!

19:36.027 --> 19:38.113
I will see who it is.

19:40.491 --> 19:42.700
Wow, this is a surprise.

19:42.784 --> 19:44.035
Neal McBeal.

19:44.119 --> 19:45.787
Hello, sir.

19:45.870 --> 19:49.124
Thank you for inviting me
into your home. It is lovely.

19:49.207 --> 19:53.878
BoJack, is there anything
you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

19:53.962 --> 19:55.088
Ahem.

19:55.172 --> 19:57.299
Oh, yeah, Todd?

19:57.382 --> 19:58.550
What the hell is this?

19:58.633 --> 20:00.010
I tried to buy the muffins,

20:00.093 --> 20:02.429
but my bank card got
declined for some reason.

20:02.513 --> 20:04.431
But don't worry, I still saved the day

20:04.515 --> 20:07.684
because I found this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

20:07.767 --> 20:09.811
I'm sorry?

20:09.894 --> 20:12.147
Yeah, they're just giving
them away behind In-N-Out.

20:12.230 --> 20:14.441
Why does anybody pay for anything?

20:14.525 --> 20:15.942
Ow.

20:16.026 --> 20:18.403
Uh, Neal, as a token of my admiration,

20:18.487 --> 20:23.408
please accept this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

20:23.492 --> 20:25.869
- What?
- Yes, hamburger buns.

20:25.952 --> 20:29.498
It's a symbol for how we throw our veterans

20:29.581 --> 20:32.167
in the trash, sadly, far too often.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.127
I'm listening.

20:34.211 --> 20:35.962
We send our muffins overseas,

20:36.046 --> 20:38.423
and they come back as stale hamburger buns,

20:38.507 --> 20:41.385
but that doesn't mean we
should love them any less,

20:41.468 --> 20:42.969
because in their own way,

20:43.053 --> 20:46.973
aren't stale hamburger buns just as good?

20:47.057 --> 20:49.267
Mmm.

20:49.351 --> 20:50.643
American made.

20:50.727 --> 20:54.647
So what you're saying is,

20:54.731 --> 20:57.067
you think I'm a hero.

20:57.150 --> 20:58.360
Well, I don't know if I...

20:58.443 --> 21:03.323
Say it, BoJack. Say I'm a hero.

21:03.407 --> 21:04.824
You're a hero.

21:04.908 --> 21:08.412
The troops are all
heroes, every single one.

21:08.495 --> 21:10.247
Great.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.916
And I don't believe saying
that cheapens the word

21:12.999 --> 21:15.293
and actually disrespects
those we mean to honor

21:15.377 --> 21:18.505
by turning real people
into political pawns.

21:18.589 --> 21:21.383
Okay, you can let go of the bag now.

21:21.466 --> 21:23.927
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent

21:24.010 --> 21:26.346
about a seemingly mandated
celebration of our military

21:26.430 --> 21:28.390
by a nation that claims to value peace

21:28.473 --> 21:31.268
telling our children that
violence is never the answer

21:31.351 --> 21:34.438
while refusing to hold our own
government to the same standard.

21:34.521 --> 21:37.148
Yeah, me neither. I think
we're in agreement here.

21:37.232 --> 21:40.277
Furthermore, I do not find
it unbelievably appropriate

21:40.360 --> 21:43.321
that this conversation is taking
place on reality television,

21:43.405 --> 21:44.906
a genre which thrives on

21:44.989 --> 21:46.908
chopping the complexities of our era

21:46.991 --> 21:50.495
into easily digestible
chunks of empty catchphrases.

21:50.579 --> 21:52.539
Okay.

21:52.623 --> 21:54.374
And finally, I don't...

21:54.458 --> 21:58.211
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter
got a bucket stuck on his head.

21:58.295 --> 22:01.339
Guys, guys, where am I? Can
someone tell me where I am?

22:01.423 --> 22:03.592
Hey, where'd he get that bucket from?

22:03.675 --> 22:05.385
Who gave him a bucket?

22:07.845 --> 22:10.557
Uh, actually, I had another
point I wanted to make.

22:10.641 --> 22:13.726
Yeah, but who doesn't love a
dog with a bucket on his head?

22:13.810 --> 22:14.936
Come on.

22:15.019 --> 22:16.729
Bucket! Bucket!

22:16.813 --> 22:18.064
Bucket!

22:18.148 --> 22:22.152
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

22:22.235 --> 22:24.529
Hey, can anyone find a handle?

22:26.573 --> 22:29.159
Oh, thank you, my friend.

22:29.242 --> 22:30.994
You're a real hero.

22:31.077 --> 22:32.370
Unbelievable.

22:32.454 --> 22:33.746
What's your name, young lady?

22:33.830 --> 22:35.624
Well, my real name's Angela,

22:35.707 --> 22:37.208
but my friends call me Jelly.

22:37.292 --> 22:40.170
What? Oh, my God, did we get that?

22:40.253 --> 22:42.755
Please tell me we got that.

22:50.263 --> 22:51.682
You want a day-old hamburger bun?

22:51.764 --> 22:53.891
I'm all right. How'd it go down there?

22:53.975 --> 22:56.311
You know what the
problem is with everybody?

22:56.394 --> 22:58.980
They all just want to hear
what they already believe.

22:59.063 --> 23:00.940
No one ever wants to hear the truth.

23:01.024 --> 23:02.442
I want to hear the truth.

23:02.526 --> 23:04.027
I don't know if you
want to tell it, though.

23:04.110 --> 23:05.570
What do you mean?

23:05.654 --> 23:09.407
Mr. Normal Childhood,
Mr. Uneventful Father?

23:09.491 --> 23:10.992
Look, I can write you the standard

23:11.075 --> 23:13.077
empty-calorie
celebrity tell-some,

23:13.161 --> 23:14.579
if that's what you're looking for,

23:14.663 --> 23:15.706
but I thought you might
want more than that.

23:15.788 --> 23:17.332
I do.

23:17.415 --> 23:18.958
Well, then you're going to have to open up

23:19.042 --> 23:20.544
and give me something real.

23:20.627 --> 23:22.086
What, you think I can't open up?

23:22.170 --> 23:23.254
Well, I don't know if you can or not.

23:23.338 --> 23:24.881
You certainly haven't.

23:26.633 --> 23:31.054
Okay, from now on, full
truth, warts and all.

23:31.137 --> 23:33.724
You're not gonna make me
look like an asshole, are you?

23:33.806 --> 23:35.892
I don't know, are you an asshole?

23:37.435 --> 23:40.647
Okay, full truth, here we go.

23:40.731 --> 23:42.315
You want to know about my parents?

23:42.399 --> 23:44.401
They drank a lot.

23:44.484 --> 23:46.236
My father was a failed novelist.

23:46.319 --> 23:49.280
My mother was the heiress to
the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

23:49.364 --> 23:50.741
and my dad resented her for it.

23:50.823 --> 23:52.409
He used to make me cry with him

23:52.492 --> 23:54.202
while listening to Cole Porter records.

23:54.285 --> 23:56.162
He made me build my own tree house,

23:56.246 --> 23:57.997
and then he tore it down
while I was at summer camp

23:58.081 --> 23:59.916
because instead of hearty, Christian nails,

23:59.999 --> 24:04.212
I used screws, which he
called fancy Jew nails.

24:04.295 --> 24:07.298
