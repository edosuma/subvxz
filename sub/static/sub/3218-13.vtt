00:02.161 --> 00:05.328
What do you say we kill some
evil sons of bitches and raise hell?

00:10.379 --> 00:13.583
- You're offering up your soul?
- All you gotta do is bring Sam back.

00:13.758 --> 00:15.632
- How long did they give you?
- One year.

00:15.802 --> 00:17.842

- We'll save you.

00:36.284 --> 00:39.903

...is the bold new future

Mm. We know you've had it hard
during the writers' strike.

01:16.247 --> 01:17.659
Lazy fat cats.

01:17.833 --> 01:20.502
Who needs writers
when you got guys like us?

01:20.669 --> 01:25.628

02:49.522 --> 02:53.306

get off by 6.</i>

02:56.197 --> 02:57.395
<i>- Every night.
Yeah, 6:00.</i>

02:57.573 --> 03:01.025
It used to be just, you know,
you and I taking on the cases.

03:01.203 --> 03:03.361
- Just Harry and me.
- Two lone wolves.

03:03.538 --> 03:06.409
And two lone wolves need, uh...

03:07.752 --> 03:09.791
...other wolves.

03:13.091 --> 03:15.962
- Morning, Facers.
- Good morning, Ghostfacers.

03:16.136 --> 03:17.512
It's 7 p. m., dude.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.637
It's morning to a Ghostfacer.

03:19.807 --> 03:22.559
- Corbett, what we got, buddy?
I'm just putting up some...

03:22.727 --> 03:25.135
This has gotta go here,
gotta see the whole field.

03:25.313 --> 03:27.106
Markers, eraser, good job.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.690
I first saw Ed, uh...

03:30.861 --> 03:36.367
...putting up flyers
down at the outlet mall in Scogan.

03:36.535 --> 03:41.198
So I read one and I thought to myself:

03:41.374 --> 03:44.541
"Huh. Where do ghosts come from?"

03:44.711 --> 03:48.211
And now, here I am.

03:52.721 --> 03:55.390
Oh, ow! Ed, your sister's abusing staff.

03:55.557 --> 03:58.226
That's adopted sister,
thank you very much.

03:58.393 --> 04:01.479
Ed has been obsessed with
the supernatural since we were kids...

04:01.647 --> 04:03.973
...you know,
and then he meets Harry...

04:04.150 --> 04:07.318
...at computer camp
and love at first geek.

04:08.989 --> 04:10.068
Spruce here.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.326
What up, player?

04:13.495 --> 04:16.329
I am fifteen-sixteenths Jew...

04:16.498 --> 04:20.449
...one-sixteenth Cherokee.
My grandfather is a mohel.

04:20.628 --> 04:24.127
My great-grandfather
was a talus maker.

04:24.298 --> 04:28.083
And my great-great-grandfather
was a degenerate gambler...

04:28.262 --> 04:31.216
...and, uh, had a peyote addiction.

04:31.391 --> 04:34.760
Okay, people, let's cut the chatter
and get on a mission.

04:35.353 --> 04:36.681
Okay.

04:36.854 --> 04:37.970
Morton House.

04:40.526 --> 04:42.768
One of our big fish.

04:42.945 --> 04:44.654
All right, we all know the legend.

04:44.823 --> 04:46.899
Every four years,
supposedly this becomes...

04:47.075 --> 04:49.483
...the most haunted place in America.

04:51.330 --> 04:54.082
The leap-year ghost some call it.

04:54.292 --> 04:57.459
The ghost returns at midnight
just as February 29th begins.

04:57.629 --> 05:01.164
- And no one has ever stayed the night.
- Yeah, every testimony we dug up...

05:01.341 --> 05:03.750
...every eyewitness has run
well before midnight.

05:03.928 --> 05:07.344
- That's all about to change, isn't it, baby?
- Absolutely true, Ed.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.757
- Absolutely true.
- Mm, that's good.

05:09.934 --> 05:15.096
French vanilla, because the other day
you said how much you liked it, so...

05:15.274 --> 05:16.935
Thank you.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.893
You are welcome.

05:25.245 --> 05:28.530
I like Corbett, I do. Um...

05:28.706 --> 05:30.996
Shows up early, does his job.

05:31.168 --> 05:33.410
A lot of good hustle out...

05:39.636 --> 05:43.255
I think he's got the hots for Ed
and that could spell trouble for the team.

05:43.432 --> 05:48.937
Ed's kind of the more rugged,
with that really golden...

05:49.648 --> 05:52.898
...beautiful sort of beard. Ha, ha.

05:53.068 --> 05:56.734
Uh, and Harry's nice.

05:56.906 --> 05:58.531
Twenty-ninth...

05:59.200 --> 06:00.529
...is this Friday, Facers.

06:00.702 --> 06:03.739
We want this mission, we gotta
move on it now, or guess what.

06:03.914 --> 06:06.073
He's gone for another four years.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.041
- What's this?
Wait a minute.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.370
Watch out. Oh.

06:11.631 --> 06:14.882
- Oh, Dad, come on!
Let's just cut the cameras.

06:15.052 --> 06:17.129
We don't need that.
We don't need this part.

06:24.063 --> 06:26.980
Stay low. Follow formation.

06:27.983 --> 06:31.187
Okay, as expected.

06:31.905 --> 06:34.693
A lot of people have tried to break into
the Morton House.

06:34.867 --> 06:37.156
The local authorities
have just gotten fed up.

06:37.328 --> 06:41.409
Looks like the cops have got this place
pretty well fenced off.

06:41.917 --> 06:44.752
Wait. Didn't you guys get, like,
a permit or something?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.328
A permit?
That's a good idea for next time.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.049
Yeah.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.667
Car, car.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.087
Flashlights off.
Corbett!

06:54.265 --> 06:56.174
Okay, okay.

06:57.893 --> 07:01.098
Hey, hey, hey. Shh.

07:01.273 --> 07:03.764
Be totally still.

07:22.464 --> 07:24.421
It's okay. Not cops, just hicks.

07:24.591 --> 07:26.215
Not cops, not cops.
Ed.

07:26.384 --> 07:29.386
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Ed's got it, Ed's got it.

07:29.555 --> 07:31.382
Guys, let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:31.557 --> 07:32.636
- Go.
Let's go.

07:32.808 --> 07:33.889
Go, Spruce.

07:37.648 --> 07:39.522
Still, be quiet.

07:47.076 --> 07:49.745
There's the kitchen sink.
Copy that.

07:54.209 --> 07:57.376
All right, everybody.
Ghostfacers, let's line up.

07:57.546 --> 07:58.744
Everybody.

07:59.257 --> 08:02.174
We're gonna set up camp right here.
This is Command Center 1.

08:02.343 --> 08:03.802
We call this the Eagle's Nest.

08:23.159 --> 08:24.617
Hallway, Cam 1 up and running.

08:24.786 --> 08:25.949
Looking good, Corbett.

08:27.706 --> 08:29.829
Copy that, Ed.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.709
Uh...

08:31.878 --> 08:34.499
Uh, you're welcome.
Spruce, how are we doing there, buddy?

08:34.672 --> 08:36.879
<i>Checking basement, Camera 2,
mein FÃ¼hrer.</i>

08:37.049 --> 08:38.878
Maggie, I got no visual on you,
Maggie.

08:39.053 --> 08:40.796
<i>- Do you copy?
There you are.</i>

08:40.971 --> 08:43.130
<i>- Harry, you alive?
Upstairs den, Camera 1.</i>

08:43.307 --> 08:45.135
<i>Good, good. I can smell syndication.</i>

08:45.310 --> 08:48.145
All right, fellas,
let's regroup at the Eagle's Nest.

08:49.856 --> 08:51.482
- Hey, Spengler.
Right there.

08:51.651 --> 08:53.061
- Battery check.
Check.

08:53.236 --> 08:55.359
- Check. Check.
Okay.

08:55.530 --> 08:56.810
Look at Corbett.

08:56.989 --> 08:59.149
Yo, Corbett, dude.
- Looking good, Corbett.

08:59.326 --> 09:01.319
You're Robocop.
- Robocop?

09:01.495 --> 09:04.413
- You think I look like Robocop?
Everybody, bring it in.

09:04.582 --> 09:07.156
We've all been here before.
Standard walk-through.

09:07.335 --> 09:08.877
- Team one, west.
Okay.

09:09.045 --> 09:10.955
- Team two, east.
- Got it.

09:11.132 --> 09:14.049
Spin the tires, light the fires.
Ghostfacers on three.

09:14.218 --> 09:17.718
One, two, three, Ghostfacers!

09:26.524 --> 09:28.267
Hello?

09:29.027 --> 09:32.527
I'm speaking to the restless spirits
of the Morton House.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.360
- Let's go in.
Okay.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.488
Okay.

09:37.787 --> 09:38.867
Hello?

09:39.039 --> 09:40.497
My name's Ed.

09:44.754 --> 09:46.545
Careful.

09:48.216 --> 09:49.248
Watch your back.

09:49.426 --> 09:52.842
Okay. Okay. Look over there.

09:53.972 --> 09:56.096
What's your name?

09:57.268 --> 09:59.641
0.3, 0.29.

09:59.813 --> 10:04.274
Is there an entity or entities here
with us now?

10:04.443 --> 10:06.815
- Give us a sign of your presence.
- Breathe, buddy.

10:06.987 --> 10:08.482
- I can't breathe.
- Corbett, you...

10:12.703 --> 10:14.031
Corbett, night vision.

10:14.204 --> 10:17.206
Okay. Okay, okay, I got it. Okay.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.417
- Okay.
- Calm down. Breathe. Okay?

10:19.585 --> 10:22.291
- What?
- Calm the whirlwinds of your mind.

10:26.260 --> 10:31.172
We're doing a basic EMF, EVP,
temp-flux sweep.

10:31.349 --> 10:34.184
Looks like we got all of our ducks
in a row here.

10:43.113 --> 10:45.604
Whoa.
- What?

10:45.782 --> 10:48.903
Oh. This camera's fritzing or something.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.950
That's weird.

10:54.376 --> 10:55.491
It's gone.

10:58.130 --> 11:00.087
Get this, get this.

11:02.385 --> 11:05.719
Turn the knob.
- All right, that's a good idea.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.177
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

11:09.352 --> 11:12.721
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

11:13.064 --> 11:14.607
It's just a rat, dude.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.055
I don't really like rats.

11:17.319 --> 11:18.730
They're gross.

11:18.904 --> 11:22.025
Rats are like the rats of the world.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.616
Was that a...? Was that an apparition?
Was that a spectral? A 0.4?

11:25.787 --> 11:29.572
What do we got? Because the EMP
was just off the... Oh, God!

11:29.750 --> 11:31.790
Oh, that is so not funny, Spruce!

11:38.218 --> 11:41.719
Oh, God. Okay, it was just...
I think it was just this branch.

11:41.890 --> 11:44.559
Okay. In the window.

11:44.726 --> 11:47.681
- This is spooky, man.
- It's pretty spooky.

11:48.439 --> 11:51.523
Aah!
Freeze! Police officers!

11:51.692 --> 11:53.318
Oh, God.

11:53.487 --> 11:55.313
Take it easy.
Let's see identification.

11:55.489 --> 11:57.528
- Come on. Let's see some ID.
Why are we...?

11:57.699 --> 11:59.491
- Are we under arrest?
We are unarmed.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.238
Oh, God. Oh, God.

12:01.412 --> 12:04.532
You want to explain that weirdo outfit,
Mr., uh, Corbett?

12:04.707 --> 12:08.077
- Uh...
- Whoa. I know you.

12:08.253 --> 12:10.211
Yeah, sure you do.
Give me some identification.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.919
Hold on a second.
I know the both of you guys. Yeah.

12:13.093 --> 12:14.919
What?
- Yeah.

12:15.220 --> 12:17.212
<i>Holy * * * *.</i>

12:17.389 --> 12:19.014
What?

12:19.183 --> 12:22.350
Uh, west Texas,
the tulpa we had to take out.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.763
Those two goofballs
that almost got us killed.

12:24.940 --> 12:28.143
Uh, Hellhounds or something?

12:30.445 --> 12:32.605
<i>- * * * * me.
- Yeah. We're not Hellhounds anymore.</i>

12:32.782 --> 12:34.739
- Didn't test that well.
- What's going on?

12:34.909 --> 12:35.940
They're not cops. No.

12:36.119 --> 12:38.955
Ed, thought you had a partner,
didn't you? A different guy?

12:39.123 --> 12:40.534
Yeah.
Is he here?

12:40.708 --> 12:43.115
Running around, chasing ghosts.
- Okay, listen.

12:43.294 --> 12:45.583
You and Rambo need to get
your girlfriends and get out.

12:45.755 --> 12:47.748
Ha-ha-ha. All right.

12:47.924 --> 12:50.131
Listen here, chisel chest, okay?

12:50.302 --> 12:51.761
We were here first.

12:51.929 --> 12:53.922
We've already set up base camp.

12:54.098 --> 12:56.091
We beat you.

12:56.392 --> 12:58.386
- They were here first.
Mm-hm. Ha, ha.

12:58.729 --> 13:00.805
Oh, God!

13:00.981 --> 13:02.261
- Ed?
- Yeah?

13:02.441 --> 13:03.472
Where's your partner?

13:05.904 --> 13:09.604
Ten-six, ten-seven.
Guys, the EMF is really spiking here.

13:09.783 --> 13:12.903
Temperature's down 11 degrees.
Keep your eyes peeled.

13:13.079 --> 13:14.703
This could be it.

13:15.206 --> 13:17.828
Maggie, can I get a reading in here,
please?

13:20.754 --> 13:22.581
Something keeps messing
with the chip.

13:22.756 --> 13:24.714
I don't know what's going on here.

13:25.218 --> 13:28.753
- Guys. Guys. Guys.
What is this?

13:28.930 --> 13:33.059
Look, buddy, I'm sorry. That's it.
I'm telling you, that's all the money I...

13:45.283 --> 13:48.819
What're you doing at
the Morton House? On leap year?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.783
We're here to spend the night, okay?
It's for our TV show.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.784
What? Great. Perfect.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.080
- Nobody's spent the night before.
- Uh, actually, yeah, they have.

13:57.255 --> 13:58.500
Uh, we've never heard of them.

13:58.674 --> 14:02.090
Yeah, you know why? The ones that
have, haven't lived to talk about it.

14:02.262 --> 14:04.135
Oh, come on, I don't believe you.

14:04.305 --> 14:07.721
Look, missing-persons reports
going back almost a half century.

14:07.892 --> 14:11.594
Uh, John Graham
stayed on a dare: Gone.

14:11.772 --> 14:14.441
Julie Wilkerson: Gone.
There are tons more.

14:14.609 --> 14:17.396
All of them came to stay the night,
always on a leap year.

14:17.571 --> 14:20.774
The only body they ever found
was the last owner, Freeman Daggett.

14:20.950 --> 14:22.777
These look legit.
- They are legit.

14:22.952 --> 14:24.363
And we ain't got much time.

14:24.537 --> 14:27.028
Starting at midnight,
your friends are going to die.

14:27.206 --> 14:29.247
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:29.418 --> 14:32.419
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Guys! Guys! Oh, my God!

14:32.588 --> 14:33.702
Oh, my God, we got one!

14:33.881 --> 14:35.340
- Corbett! We saw it.
What?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.884
A full apparition!
- Get out.

14:37.051 --> 14:40.967
- It was a Class 4, a spectral illumination.
It was absolutely amazing.

14:43.893 --> 14:46.300
<i>Hey, aren't those the * * * * * * * *
from Texas?</i>

14:46.479 --> 14:47.511
Yes.

14:47.689 --> 14:49.682
Let's have this reunion
across the street.

14:49.858 --> 14:52.016
What are you doing here?
- Get you ice cream.

14:52.194 --> 14:55.611
- What do you say? Let's go.
Guys, I think you should listen...

14:55.782 --> 14:58.818
No, no, no. Look at this.
The honest-to-God proof, all right?

15:01.747 --> 15:03.953
Are you kidding me?
No, not kidding you.

15:04.124 --> 15:05.832
- We got ghosts.
- What reading did we get?

15:06.001 --> 15:08.078
- Uh, it was a 10.9.
10.9?

15:08.255 --> 15:11.670
Yeah, it was 10.9, it was almost 11.
And I was like, "What's going on?"

15:11.841 --> 15:13.965
- And I was...
Hold on, watch this part.

15:14.136 --> 15:16.046
Oh!
He got blasted.

15:16.222 --> 15:18.096
It was crazy.
Oh, my God.

15:23.564 --> 15:24.678
What's a death echo?

15:24.857 --> 15:27.396
Look, if we got a problem here,
that ghost ain't it.

15:27.569 --> 15:31.151
That's real. Like, that happened.
What's a death echo?

15:31.322 --> 15:33.363
Echoes are trapped in a loop, okay?

15:33.534 --> 15:36.203
They keep replaying how they died
over and over again...

15:36.370 --> 15:40.120
...usually in the place where they were
ganked. As dangerous as a scary movie.

15:40.292 --> 15:42.580
The echo's not dangerous,
but something else is.

15:42.753 --> 15:44.829
- You're right.
- We need to get out. Come on.

15:45.005 --> 15:46.749
- Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go, guys.

15:46.924 --> 15:48.882
Guys, time is running out.

15:50.887 --> 15:53.295
But what about our equipment?
What are we gonna...?

15:53.474 --> 15:55.929
We got the material.
We got all kinds of stuff.

15:56.101 --> 15:59.554
- We'll make you recurring guest stars.
Wait! Wait! Wait!

16:00.815 --> 16:01.895
Where's Corbett?

16:02.067 --> 16:05.401
I wish to communicate
with the restless spirits here.

16:11.536 --> 16:18.074
Oh. Lights out.
I think I got night-vision here.

16:23.299 --> 16:24.759
That's better.

16:24.927 --> 16:26.125
No man left behind.

16:29.139 --> 16:31.098
That was Corbett.
- Come in, Corbett.

16:31.268 --> 16:34.019
Tell Corbett we'll get him.
Corbett, don't worry!

16:34.187 --> 16:35.563
Guys.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.439
<i>* * * * you!</i>

16:37.608 --> 16:38.771
Where are you, dude?

16:38.943 --> 16:41.066
- Tell us where you are!
Corbett!

16:41.237 --> 16:44.109
Let me go! Aah! Guys!

16:44.283 --> 16:46.571
- Come back, Corbett.
- Aah!

16:46.744 --> 16:47.942
Hey, hey, hey! Come on.

16:48.871 --> 16:51.160
Hey, hey, hey!

16:56.797 --> 16:58.256
Hey, Corbett's...

16:58.424 --> 17:00.298
He's not here.
Let's go. Let's go back.

17:01.260 --> 17:03.752
No, no, no. That was Corbett.
Didn't you hear that?

17:03.930 --> 17:06.219
Sam, get them out of here.
Let's go, come on.

17:06.391 --> 17:08.717
- There we go. Keep it moving.
Looking good.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.934
Corbett?
All right.

17:11.105 --> 17:12.683
Hey. Come on, let's go.
Hey.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.601
Watch him. Watch him.
- Take a left.

17:14.776 --> 17:17.612
Move, move. Let's go. Turn it off.

17:17.780 --> 17:20.271
Oh, God, what's happened?

17:20.449 --> 17:23.155
Oh, God. He's gone.

17:23.328 --> 17:24.526
He just disappeared.

17:24.704 --> 17:27.030
Let's go through all the angles,
all the cameras.

17:27.207 --> 17:29.781
- It's 12:04, Dean. Good? You happy?
- Yeah, I am happy.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.630
"Let's go hunt the Morton House.
It's our Grand Canyon. "

17:32.797 --> 17:35.122
I don't wanna hear it.
You got two months left.

17:35.299 --> 17:38.634
- Instead, we're gonna die tonight.
Whoa, whoa!

17:38.804 --> 17:41.425
- What is going on, guys?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

17:41.598 --> 17:45.644
Every door, every window, every exit
out of this house, they're all sealed.

17:45.812 --> 17:48.600
- Why are they sealed?
- It's a supernatural lockdown, okay?

17:48.774 --> 17:51.016
Whatever took Corbett
doesn't want us to leave.

17:51.193 --> 17:54.313
And it's no death echo,
this is a bad mother. It wants us scared.

17:54.488 --> 17:56.897
Or it just wants us.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.286
Uh, guys, the camera's fritzing again.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.410
Whoa. Guys, the EMF's starting to spike.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.995
- This is a big one.
Ed.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.412
Everybody stay close,
there's something coming.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.332
Guys.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.592
Uh, whoa.
Okay, let's... Let's just stay...

18:13.761 --> 18:15.754
Whoa!

18:15.931 --> 18:18.682
Guys, is this the same echo
you guys saw earlier?

18:18.850 --> 18:21.805
- No, it's a different guy.
- Multiple echoes? What's going on?

18:21.979 --> 18:23.224
Beats me.

18:23.397 --> 18:25.141
Okay. All right, all right, all right.

18:25.316 --> 18:28.022
Uh, hey, buddy! Hey, hey.

18:28.195 --> 18:30.234
Wake up. You're dead!

18:30.656 --> 18:32.695
- Hello?
- What's he doing? What's he doing?

18:32.866 --> 18:35.239
Sometimes you can shock
an echo out of its loop...

18:35.411 --> 18:37.784
...if you can talk to the part
that's still human.

18:37.956 --> 18:40.874
But usually you have to have
some connection to the deceased.

18:41.043 --> 18:43.534
Come on, wake up! Be dead! Huh?

18:44.922 --> 18:46.630
Hey! Hey!
- You guys hear that?

18:46.799 --> 18:48.839
- What's that sound?
- You guys hear that?

18:49.010 --> 18:51.501
What is that?
- Snap out of it, buddy, huh?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.222
What are you waiting for?
You're dead.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.389
Oh!
Where the hell did it go?

19:08.825 --> 19:10.153
There's no records of this.

19:10.327 --> 19:13.282
No one got shot here, no one got
run over by a train. Stay close.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.950
Did the echoes take Corbett?

19:15.124 --> 19:17.449
Yes... No. We don't know
what's doing what here...

19:17.627 --> 19:20.913
...that's what we're trying to figure out.
Stay close.

19:22.299 --> 19:25.086
Okay, look, um,
death echoes are ghosts, okay?

19:25.260 --> 19:28.048
Now, ghosts usually haunt places
where they lived or died.

19:28.223 --> 19:30.262
Except these mooks
didn't live or die here.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.226
Right.
What are they doing here?

19:32.394 --> 19:34.968
Hey, give the lady a cigar.

19:35.147 --> 19:37.187
Does looking at this
through that camera...

19:37.358 --> 19:39.601
...make you feel better or something?
I mean...

19:39.778 --> 19:42.447
Um... I, uh...

19:42.614 --> 19:45.533
- Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, I think so. Mm-hm.
- Oh.

20:04.472 --> 20:06.881
Freeman Daggett, house's last owner.

20:07.059 --> 20:09.550
Officially commended for 20 years
of fine service...

20:09.729 --> 20:13.146
...at the Gamble General Hospital.
He's a doctor?

20:13.525 --> 20:15.150
Janitor.

20:15.611 --> 20:17.484
This looks like his den.

20:17.655 --> 20:20.146
- When did you say he died? '64?
- Yeah. Heart attack.

20:20.325 --> 20:24.406
What are these, C rations?
Army-issued, three squares.

20:24.580 --> 20:26.988
Like, a lifetime supply.

20:27.416 --> 20:29.124
God, is that all he ate?

20:29.293 --> 20:31.536
One-stop shopping.

20:33.340 --> 20:34.620
Hello. Locked.

20:34.799 --> 20:37.755
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.
How is this supposed to find Corbett?

20:37.929 --> 20:41.677
Huh? We should be digging up
the frigging floorboards right now.

20:41.849 --> 20:46.228
<i>Huh. Survival Under Atomic Attack.</i>

20:46.396 --> 20:47.476
An optimist.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.204
Crap.

21:05.377 --> 21:06.919
Crap.

21:07.087 --> 21:09.080
Taxidermy. Okay.

21:09.256 --> 21:12.258
- You said Daggett was a hospital janitor?
Yeah.

21:12.427 --> 21:13.921
Ew.

21:14.095 --> 21:15.506
We got three toe tags here.

21:15.680 --> 21:20.722
One, death by gunshots,
train accident, and suicide.

21:22.313 --> 21:23.974
Ew.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.726
What?

21:26.067 --> 21:29.319
Well, that explains
why all the death echoes are here.

21:30.990 --> 21:35.237
They're here because
their bodies are here.

21:35.411 --> 21:38.448
- Somewhere in the house.
- What?

21:38.624 --> 21:43.536
Daggett brought the remains home
from the morgue to play.

21:47.050 --> 21:48.510
Ew!

21:48.677 --> 21:50.919
That's nasty, dude.

21:51.097 --> 21:52.211
Right.

21:52.389 --> 21:53.848
Wait a minute.

21:54.016 --> 21:56.804
Corbett.

22:03.236 --> 22:06.190
Okay, Maggie.

22:14.457 --> 22:16.497
- Closer to the herd, okay?
Maggie?

22:16.668 --> 22:18.707
- Maggie?
She's fine.

22:18.878 --> 22:22.829
Harry, I got an 8.6 and climbing
fast. Something huge is coming. Look.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.337
Something big is coming.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.885
It's past 11, you guys.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.964
What is happening?
Nobody move.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.631
Hold on, hold on. Stay quiet.

22:33.061 --> 22:35.221
- What's going on? Sam?
Ed.

22:35.398 --> 22:36.976
Must be the surge.

22:37.150 --> 22:38.395
Sam?

22:39.152 --> 22:40.528
Where'd he go?

22:40.696 --> 22:42.356
Oh, no.

22:43.407 --> 22:44.866
Oh.

22:49.164 --> 22:51.073
Sam!

22:56.103 --> 22:57.218
Sammy!
Sam!

22:57.313 --> 22:59.983
Yo! Talk to us!
Corbett, Corbett!

23:00.150 --> 23:01.229
- Sammy!
Sam?

23:01.401 --> 23:03.441
Corbett, Corbett!

23:04.780 --> 23:06.441
Corbett!

23:06.616 --> 23:09.533
- Corbett!
- Sam!

23:12.706 --> 23:13.904
God, I am so scared.

23:15.417 --> 23:16.449
I'm so scared.

23:16.627 --> 23:18.002
It's gonna be okay.

23:18.170 --> 23:21.042
It's gonna be okay, Maggie.

23:29.225 --> 23:31.217
Corbett!

23:39.529 --> 23:41.486
Whoa.

23:51.793 --> 23:54.000
My best friend...

23:54.755 --> 23:56.165
...and my best sister.
Ed.

23:56.339 --> 23:57.419
- Harry.
- Ed.

23:57.591 --> 23:59.051
- Harry.
- Ed. Listen, Ed...

23:59.218 --> 24:00.547
Are you banging my sister?

24:01.804 --> 24:03.002
No.

24:03.181 --> 24:04.890
No.

24:05.643 --> 24:07.765
- Hold my glasses.
You got it.

24:07.936 --> 24:10.606
Ed, Ed, Ed!

24:10.773 --> 24:14.107
Guys. Guys.
Ed, get off. You guys, stop.

24:14.277 --> 24:16.649
You guys are in trouble.
Hey, hey, hey!

24:17.280 --> 24:18.610
<i>The * * * * are you doing?</i>

24:18.783 --> 24:20.443
Cut it out!

24:20.618 --> 24:23.156
We're down by two people.

24:24.998 --> 24:26.576
Sam!

24:26.750 --> 24:28.161
Great.

24:28.335 --> 24:29.794
Sammy!

24:29.962 --> 24:31.671
Sorry.

24:33.633 --> 24:35.839
I'm sorry.

24:38.013 --> 24:39.556
You got my glasses.

24:40.057 --> 24:42.014
- He got my tooth there?
Uh, no.

24:42.184 --> 24:44.972
- I won that, right?
Yup, you're good.

24:48.608 --> 24:50.935
- Thanks, Spruce.
Yeah, it's my fault.

24:51.112 --> 24:53.021
Great. That's nice. Thanks.

24:58.829 --> 25:00.204
Corbett.

25:01.874 --> 25:03.499
Corbett.

25:04.419 --> 25:05.534
Corbett.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.705
Hey. Wake up, man.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.040
Corbett, hey.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.676
- Corbett, hey.
Sam?

25:11.844 --> 25:14.050
You gotta keep listening
to my voice, okay?

25:14.221 --> 25:15.882
I'm right here.

25:16.058 --> 25:17.303
Stay awake.

25:17.476 --> 25:19.018
Don't listen to him.

25:20.896 --> 25:23.649
It stops hurting, so don't worry.

25:27.237 --> 25:28.482
Corbett, stay with me.

25:28.655 --> 25:30.695
Stay with me, you got it?
I'm right here.

25:30.866 --> 25:33.571
Hey. Stay with me. Don't.

25:33.744 --> 25:36.153
Don't. No!

25:36.706 --> 25:37.904
Corbett!

25:40.460 --> 25:42.205
Corbett!

25:51.390 --> 25:52.588
- Corbett!
Where'd you go?

25:52.766 --> 25:54.593
Where are you guys?

25:56.980 --> 25:59.767
Dean, what are you doing?
Daggett was a Cold-War nut.

25:59.941 --> 26:02.148
He was an amateur taxidermist.

26:02.319 --> 26:05.570
He liked to slow dance with cadavers
and all he ate was C rations.

26:05.740 --> 26:07.899
- So what are we looking for?
A horrible life.

26:08.076 --> 26:09.950
A lonely life.

26:10.454 --> 26:12.446
A Cold-War life.

26:13.498 --> 26:15.124
He was scared.

26:15.293 --> 26:17.784
- He was scared. He was scared.
Scared of what?

26:17.962 --> 26:19.373
What?
Where are you going?

26:19.547 --> 26:21.920
Don't leave me in here. Guys.
Wait. Dean!

26:22.092 --> 26:23.207
Get away from me.

26:23.385 --> 26:25.129
This won't hurt.

26:25.304 --> 26:27.974
It's okay. It's okay.

26:28.141 --> 26:29.885
Relax.

26:30.060 --> 26:32.052
Relax.

26:39.487 --> 26:40.733
Where are you going?

26:40.906 --> 26:43.907
Guys like Daggett back then,
the ones scared of the Russkies...

26:44.076 --> 26:45.404
...they built bomb shelters.

26:45.577 --> 26:46.907
I'm guessing he's got one.

26:47.747 --> 26:49.704
I'll bet you it's in the basement.

26:52.293 --> 26:53.409
Whoa!

26:53.587 --> 26:55.545
That is not funny. How many times...?

26:55.714 --> 26:57.837
Uh, who closed the door?
It did.

26:58.008 --> 26:59.253
It wants to separate us.

26:59.427 --> 27:02.263
Ed, listen to me.
There's some salt in my duffle.

27:02.431 --> 27:04.008
Make a circle and get inside.

27:08.896 --> 27:10.640
- Inside his...?
- That's stupid.

27:10.815 --> 27:12.013
Inside your duffle bag?

27:12.191 --> 27:13.390
In the salt, you idiot!

27:13.569 --> 27:15.775
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

27:28.377 --> 27:30.584
Hurry up.
Get in the circle, get in the circle.

27:30.755 --> 27:32.795
Come on, come on. Quick, quick.

27:32.966 --> 27:36.750
Guys, guys, I don't wanna die, okay?
And I don't want you...

27:36.929 --> 27:39.088
- Hey, listen to me, okay?
- Don't want you to...

27:39.265 --> 27:41.839
Listen, if we don't die...

27:42.560 --> 27:46.476
...it's totally okay if you, uh,
do my sister.

27:46.649 --> 27:48.476
- Ow!
Nice.

27:48.651 --> 27:50.560
Guys. Hey, guys.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.185
It's coming again.

27:52.364 --> 27:55.567
Okay. Oh, God. Get in close.
- Why does this keep happening?

27:55.742 --> 27:57.782
Why does this keep happening?

27:58.371 --> 28:00.198
Oh, my God.

28:03.167 --> 28:04.330
Oh, God.

28:04.503 --> 28:06.128
Oh, God.

28:11.261 --> 28:12.292
Corbett.

28:12.470 --> 28:14.961
Hey, can I ask you something?

28:15.140 --> 28:17.596
- What?
- Earlier, you and Sam.

28:17.768 --> 28:19.595
He said you had two months left?

28:19.770 --> 28:21.348
It's complicated.

28:21.522 --> 28:23.515
A while ago, Sam...

28:25.277 --> 28:28.278
<i>No, no, no. I'm not gonna whine
about my * * * * * * * * problems...</i>

28:28.447 --> 28:30.986
<i>...to some * * * * * * * * reality show.</i>

28:31.159 --> 28:33.697
<i>I'm gonna do my * * * * * * * job.</i>

28:35.747 --> 28:38.239
Is it cancer?
- Shut up.

28:40.836 --> 28:42.580
You hear that?

28:43.130 --> 28:45.587
I've been waiting
for some more friends.

28:45.759 --> 28:47.383
I get lonely.

28:47.552 --> 28:49.592
But you're coming to my party,
aren't you?

28:49.763 --> 28:53.263
Is that music?
It's coming from behind this wall.

29:05.365 --> 29:07.322
Wow, you're strong.

29:07.492 --> 29:10.529
You'll stay a good, long time.

29:16.837 --> 29:18.379
Sam!

29:25.763 --> 29:27.507
Oh, my God.

29:40.864 --> 29:43.949
Oh, no. Corbett.

29:50.376 --> 29:52.084
Oh, God, what have we done?

29:52.253 --> 29:53.712
- Oh, Corbett.
- Ed. Ed.

29:53.879 --> 29:57.499
Yeah?
- Corbett's... He's a death echo.

29:57.676 --> 30:00.001
He's, uh, reliving his own murder.

30:00.178 --> 30:03.097
Over and over forever.

30:06.644 --> 30:09.315
What's this Daggett guy's
problem anyway?

30:09.481 --> 30:10.596
Loneliness.

30:10.774 --> 30:12.601
- Has he never heard of a RealDoll?
- No, no.

30:12.776 --> 30:16.063
Daggett was the Norman Bates,
stuff-your-mother kind of lonely.

30:16.239 --> 30:19.157
I mean, that's why he
lifted these bodies from the morgue.

30:19.326 --> 30:23.241
He threw himself a birthday party, except
they were the only ones who would come.

30:23.414 --> 30:27.247
Anyway, so at midnight, he sealed them
in the bomb shelter and went upstairs...

30:27.419 --> 30:28.961
...and OD'd on horse tranqs.

30:29.129 --> 30:30.458
How do you know this?

30:30.631 --> 30:32.873
- Because he told me.
- Oh.

30:33.050 --> 30:35.257
- Yeah.
- Okay, so now that he's dead, what?

30:35.428 --> 30:38.631
Same song, different verse,
trying to get people come to his party?

30:38.807 --> 30:41.133
Pretty much, yeah. Stay forever.

30:41.310 --> 30:43.303
Those real bullets?

30:43.521 --> 30:44.766
It's rock salt.

30:47.150 --> 30:48.858
<i>Ghostfacers</i>

30:49.027 --> 30:52.028
<i>We go to places where others will not</i>

30:52.197 --> 30:53.823
<i>Ghostfacers</i>

30:53.992 --> 30:58.072
<i>Stay in the kitchen
When the kitchen gets hot</i>

30:58.246 --> 30:59.871
Guys.

31:00.374 --> 31:03.873
Oh, no.
Oh, Corbett.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.959
Wait, guys.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.885
Guys, it's... It's Corbett.

31:13.347 --> 31:14.628
He's... He's trapped.

31:14.807 --> 31:18.306
He's in a lot of pain, you know?
We gotta... We gotta try and...

31:18.477 --> 31:21.100
We got to try
and pull him out of his loop.

31:23.358 --> 31:25.317
We have to.

31:27.030 --> 31:28.192
Ed.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.108
Corbett?

31:31.284 --> 31:33.159
Corbett, it's...

31:33.662 --> 31:36.948
- Oh, God. I gotta do it, Harry.
Don't cross the line of salt.

31:38.001 --> 31:40.208
Corbett, listen to me.

31:40.379 --> 31:42.205
Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.

31:42.381 --> 31:44.005
Listen.

31:44.592 --> 31:46.419
Listen. Oh, God.

31:46.594 --> 31:47.969
Corbett.

31:48.554 --> 31:50.843
- Oh, my God.
Get back here. Get back.

31:51.016 --> 31:53.175
I can't, okay?

31:53.352 --> 31:57.766
He's not hearing me, okay?
He won't stop dying.

32:02.362 --> 32:04.569
Seriously? You're still shooting?

32:04.740 --> 32:07.611
It makes him feel better. Don't ask.

32:10.037 --> 32:11.698
God.

32:12.916 --> 32:15.324
Oh, hell, guys.
Get in your ghost role thing.

32:15.502 --> 32:16.997
Something's coming.

32:17.172 --> 32:20.007
Oh, my God. Aah!

32:29.810 --> 32:31.638
L... I know how
we can get through to him.

32:31.813 --> 32:32.844
How?

32:33.023 --> 32:34.517
Ed.

32:36.193 --> 32:39.195
- He had feelings for you.
- Huh?

32:40.656 --> 32:43.195
- He wanted you.
- Wha...?

32:43.369 --> 32:44.779
- Wanted me to what?
- You know.

32:44.953 --> 32:46.448
No.

32:48.707 --> 32:50.867
And you know what you've gotta do.

32:52.212 --> 32:54.169
You can do it, Ed.

32:54.547 --> 32:57.715
You've always been the brave one.
Yes, you can. You make us brave.

32:57.885 --> 32:59.677
- Maggie, right? Yeah.
Yeah, you do.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.008
You totally do.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.806
Ed...

33:03.225 --> 33:05.930
...you gotta go be gay
for that poor, dead intern.

33:06.103 --> 33:08.641
You gotta send him into the light.

33:26.877 --> 33:27.908
Corbett.

33:28.629 --> 33:32.164
Maggie. No, no, Maggie.
No, it's okay. Don't worry.

33:32.341 --> 33:33.456
Corbett, look.

33:33.634 --> 33:35.046
Hey, it's just Ed, buddy.

33:35.220 --> 33:36.631
It's just me.

33:36.805 --> 33:38.798
Hey. Hey, Corbett, listen to me.

33:38.974 --> 33:42.059
Listen to me. I'm... We...

33:44.606 --> 33:46.017
Okay.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.852
You meant...

33:49.153 --> 33:51.726
Corbett, you meant a lot to the team.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.117
You meant...

33:57.663 --> 33:59.121
You meant a lot to me.

33:59.289 --> 34:02.327
You know, never ever back down...

34:02.919 --> 34:07.047
...never say a bad word, okay?
I remember that, Corbett. L...

34:07.508 --> 34:11.172
I remember that.
I remember because I love you, Corbett.

34:11.387 --> 34:14.757
I really, truly love you.

34:17.853 --> 34:18.931
Do you remember that?

34:19.103 --> 34:20.728
Do you?

34:21.440 --> 34:24.607
- Hey. Ed?
Yeah.

34:25.652 --> 34:27.610
Yeah, Corbett, it's...

34:29.408 --> 34:31.614
Corbett, yeah, it's me.

34:32.034 --> 34:34.788
It's me. Look at me.

34:36.541 --> 34:37.952
You gotta help us, man.

34:38.126 --> 34:41.330
You have to help us, Corbett.
Please. Please.

34:41.505 --> 34:44.175
Please help us right now.

34:44.341 --> 34:45.966
Take it easy. You all right?

34:46.136 --> 34:48.708
Uh, guys.

34:49.348 --> 34:52.264
Hey! Come here!

34:53.561 --> 34:55.304
This is bad. Very bad.

35:02.196 --> 35:03.987
Corbett?

35:14.252 --> 35:16.291
You all right, dude?
- Oh. Unh.

35:17.672 --> 35:19.333
You all right?
- Oh.

35:24.805 --> 35:26.882
Oh, my God.

35:45.497 --> 35:50.160
<i>Leap year, February 29th,
the Morton House.</i>

35:50.336 --> 35:51.996
<i>A tragic day.</i>

35:52.171 --> 35:55.375
<i>A day of souls bound in torment...</i>

35:55.550 --> 35:59.549
<i>...of lives held in cruel balance.</i>

35:59.722 --> 36:03.388
<i>But the Ghostfacers,
they did the best that they could.</i>

36:03.560 --> 36:07.344
<i>We lost a beloved friend...</i>

36:07.522 --> 36:10.608
<i>...but we gained new allies.</i>

36:10.776 --> 36:12.686
<i>We know this much:</i>

36:12.862 --> 36:18.202
<i>That every day, including today,
is a new beginning.</i>

36:18.869 --> 36:24.161
We learned more than we can say
in the brutal feat of the Morton House.

36:24.334 --> 36:31.631
The Ghostfacers were forced to face
something far more scary than ghosts.

36:32.593 --> 36:34.467
They were forced to face themselves.

36:36.223 --> 36:37.931
War changes man.

36:38.976 --> 36:40.553
And Maggie.

36:41.812 --> 36:45.312
War changes man...

36:45.483 --> 36:46.514
...and one woman.

36:49.655 --> 36:51.897
You know, Corbett, we just...

36:52.783 --> 36:56.734
Oh, gosh, we just like to think
that you're out there watching over us.

36:56.913 --> 37:01.207
As far as we're concerned,
you're not an intern anymore.

37:01.376 --> 37:05.541
You have more than earned
full Ghostfacer status.

37:05.715 --> 37:07.754
Plus it'd cool
to have a ghost on the team.

37:07.925 --> 37:08.958
Yeah.

37:09.136 --> 37:13.465
And here we were thinking that,
you know, we were teaching you...

37:13.640 --> 37:16.595
...and all this time,
you were teaching us...

37:17.061 --> 37:19.683
...about heart...

37:19.981 --> 37:22.271
...about dedication.

37:23.986 --> 37:25.646
About...

37:25.821 --> 37:31.861
...how gay love can pierce through
the veil of death and save the day.

37:33.205 --> 37:35.578
Thank you, Alan J. Corbett.

37:36.417 --> 37:40.201
Go well into that starry night,
young Turk.

37:42.257 --> 37:43.835
Go well.

37:51.226 --> 37:54.430
Come on, Spruce,
I gotta get all this stuff packed up.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.479
So? Pack and talk.

37:56.649 --> 37:57.894
I don't know what to say.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.859
Say what comes to mind.

38:00.028 --> 38:03.563
This is one of our confessional moments,
Corbett, so confess.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.733
What'd you think
was gonna happen tonight?

38:05.909 --> 38:09.160
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight on this trip?

38:10.123 --> 38:11.783
I think tonight...

38:11.958 --> 38:13.157
I really do.

38:13.335 --> 38:15.873
- I think all our dreams
are gonna come true.

38:17.631 --> 38:19.376
Does that sound stupid?

38:19.551 --> 38:21.674
Kind of does, yeah.
- Ha, ha.

38:43.578 --> 38:46.035
So guys, what do you think?

38:47.041 --> 38:48.535
You all right?

38:48.709 --> 38:50.868
You know, I kind of think
it was half awesome.

38:51.045 --> 38:54.497
Half awesome.
That's full-on good, right?

38:54.675 --> 38:57.213
Yeah. I mean,
it's bizarre how y'all are able to, uh...

38:57.386 --> 39:01.467
...honor Corbett's memory while grossly
exploiting the manner of his death.

39:01.641 --> 39:04.678
Yeah. No, it's a real tight rope
you guys are walking.

39:04.854 --> 39:07.226
Yeah. All right, guys.

39:08.524 --> 39:10.563
No, that's reality, man.

39:10.734 --> 39:13.309
Yeah. Corbett gave his life
searching for the truth...

39:13.488 --> 39:17.106
...and it is our job over here
to share it with the world.

39:17.284 --> 39:19.692
Right. Well, um, our experience:

39:19.871 --> 39:21.863
Know what you get
when you show the truth?

39:22.039 --> 39:23.866
A straitjacket or a punch in the face.

39:24.041 --> 39:25.537
- Sometimes both.
- Right.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.668
Come on, guys,
don't be Facer haters because...

39:27.838 --> 39:30.840
...we happened to have gotten
the footage of the century.

39:31.009 --> 39:32.468
Oh, yeah.

39:34.888 --> 39:36.086
- You got us there.
- Yeah.

39:36.264 --> 39:39.052
Yeah. Well, we'll see you guys around.

39:39.894 --> 39:42.599
- Yeah.
- Peace out.

39:49.404 --> 39:51.943
- Dicks.
- Oh, yeah.

39:52.116 --> 39:54.821
Totally.
- Yep. Let's start laying off some DVDs.

39:54.994 --> 39:57.202
That sounds like a good idea, Spruce.

39:57.373 --> 39:59.579
I think we're gonna
need a bigger office here.

39:59.750 --> 40:03.583
Because we're gonna go national,
then it's gonna go international, and...

40:03.755 --> 40:07.373
- Menudo left their dance bag behind.
- Ha-ha-ha.

40:07.551 --> 40:08.961
What's inside?

40:09.135 --> 40:10.714
Huh?

40:11.889 --> 40:14.843
Whoa. What the hell is this?

40:15.017 --> 40:18.968
Uh, seem to be having
some technical difficulty over here.

40:19.606 --> 40:22.144
- Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

40:22.317 --> 40:25.236
Wait! " No operating system
found"? Wait a minute.

40:27.866 --> 40:29.527
- We clean?
No!

40:29.702 --> 40:32.109
Are you kidding me?
No. This can't be happening.

40:32.288 --> 40:35.705
Harry. Harry. No!

40:35.959 --> 40:38.415
Electromagnet.
Wiped out every tape and hard drive.

40:38.587 --> 40:40.414
World just isn't ready
for the Ghostfacers.

40:40.589 --> 40:42.879
