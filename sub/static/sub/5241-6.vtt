WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.486
Reggie:
Da Chen Bao is Nike in China.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.613
Going with Da Chen Bao,
it sets this family up

00:10.643 --> 00:12.623
so that one day
we will have old money.

00:12.645 --> 00:15.091
Who's the new talent?

00:15.115 --> 00:17.994
- That's my mother.
- You have such power in your arms.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.056
Like a much more attractive
Manny Pacquiao.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.863
Very much completely

00:26.893 --> 00:28.531
at your service.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.939
(chuckles)

00:35.602 --> 00:37.582
(music playing)

00:40.373 --> 00:42.979
On the game-winner, what were you
thinking when it left your hand?

00:43.009 --> 00:46.456
I'm pretty sure it was,
"Please, Jesus, let this go in."

00:46.479 --> 00:49.153
- So Jesus gets the credit?
- No.

00:49.182 --> 00:53.028
If you thank Jesus for the wins,
you gotta blame Jesus for the losses.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.192
Jesus doesn't want me
bricking a buzzer-beater

00:55.221 --> 00:57.292
and pointing up to him all,
"That's on you, dude."

00:57.323 --> 00:59.030
You're saying Jesus deserves better?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.970
I tell all the complainers
around the league,

01:00.994 --> 01:02.940
"Jesus died for your sins,
not your wins."

01:02.962 --> 01:05.306
Cam, nine for 12 beyond the arc...

01:05.331 --> 01:07.368
- Sorry, gotta ice the knees, folks.
- ...seven dimes, three steals...

01:07.400 --> 01:09.641
Okay.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.444
That guy blows me off every night.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.680
If you could tell me why,
I'd appreciate it.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.482
I'm sorry. What?

01:16.509 --> 01:18.546
(music playing)

01:24.417 --> 01:27.489
Hey, Todd, is this turkey bacon
or pig bacon?

01:27.520 --> 01:29.466
Turkey bacon, ma'am.
Enjoy.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.936
You know, out of the wrong mouth,
"enjoy" kind of mean "fuck off."

01:32.959 --> 01:35.166
- Ma, his name is Ted, not Todd.
- Huh?

01:35.195 --> 01:37.106
You called him Todd.
Todd got fired.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.576
- That new butler's Ted.
- I still can't tell the difference.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.943
Turkey bacon's the one that tastes
like a waste of time.

01:41.968 --> 01:44.505
Not the difference of bacons,
the difference of butlers.

01:44.537 --> 01:47.518
White men of a certain age
with no hair all look identical.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.350
Completely identical.
Like identically identical.

01:50.376 --> 01:53.152
Ain't no difference. Each butler we hire
is just like the one we fire.

01:53.179 --> 01:56.251
Pasty, resentful fuck.
He's secretly waiting to take us out.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.319
- (Cam laughing)
- Hey, look at this.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.353
You're actually dressed
and ready to go where we're going.

02:00.386 --> 02:01.421
- Thank you.
- Cam: Chill.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.593
We ain't gotta be at the launch
of my new sneaker till 7:00.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.159
I'm not talking about
the sneaker launch thing.

02:05.191 --> 02:08.001
I'm talking about your lunch date with
the new beat reporter Isa Catalano.

02:08.026 --> 02:09.699
Don't act like you haven't
seen the texts.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.208
Oh, no, no, that's my fault, Reg.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.610
I told Cam to limit his phone use
or Wi-Fi will kill his sperm.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.547
- I want grandkids.
- I'll give you grandkids, Ma.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.608
Aw, you don't have to take the dick
just 'cause I want grandkids.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.381
- (whispers) That's sweet, though.
- There's other ways to get pregnant

02:22.408 --> 02:25.355
- besides taking the dick.
- That "Levitro" shit is expensive.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.255
- We got money now.
- And we ain't gonna keep it

02:27.280 --> 02:28.987
if we start spending it on in vitro,

02:29.015 --> 02:31.359
so just close your eyes
and think of the dick as a big clit

02:31.384 --> 02:33.489
and start investing your money
in a college fund.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.091
Just 'cause you got a new pussy, don't
be telling people to take the dick.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.226
Leave my pussy out of this.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.396
Reg, I ain't going to lunch
with some random.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.268
Oh, she ain't no random,
she's a big name.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.739
And her game story
didn't mention you,

02:42.762 --> 02:45.072
so I called, and she said
you been throwing her shade.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.806
- There's 30 reporters in that room.
- And for 29 of 'em,

02:47.834 --> 02:49.575
you'll act like you dancing for tips.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.980
Fastest road to ruin
is alienating a beat reporter.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.042
Yeah, second fastest is turkey bacon.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.417
Look, Cam, put some pants on,
let's make this right.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.251
Please, when have I ever
steered you wrong?

02:58.278 --> 03:00.588
(overlapping shouting)

03:00.613 --> 03:02.251
You tried to make me me do golf
that one time.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.420
You used to tell me
that I was straight.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.928
- The butler.
- Backstreet Boys.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.396
Reggie:
Fuck all y'all all daylong.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.421
Cam, Burnside, 1:00, man.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.456
Be an adult.
Give this woman her time.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.403
(music playing)

03:20.166 --> 03:21.975
I've never had this problem before,

03:22.001 --> 03:24.174
and I've been a reporter
since you were an ugly baby.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.582
- Ma'am, I came here to apologize.
- It's pretty simple.

03:26.606 --> 03:29.587
I cover the team, and you were raised
in a Pleistocene cave

03:29.609 --> 03:31.850
and still think women
have no business in the locker room.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.858
- I'm not like that.
- Then prove it, caveman.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.258
Take your hairy knuckles
off the floor and explain yourself.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.193
Ooh, look,
the secret of fire.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.164
I would rather not
explain myself, ma'am.

03:40.186 --> 03:43.099
Call me "ma'am" one more time, and I'll
hit you harder than your sister did.

03:43.122 --> 03:45.363
- My name is Isa.
- I know your name.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.702
I can't--
Look, okay, I am...

03:48.728 --> 03:50.173
This is gonna sound so stupid.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.642
I am extremely
uncomfortable around you.

03:52.665 --> 03:55.612
Because I call you on your shit,
which I bet nobody ever does.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.273
People do, and that's not what I mean.

03:57.303 --> 04:00.113
Uncomfortable as in,
like, flustered.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.914
Flushed, you know?

04:01.941 --> 04:04.785
"Hot and bothered" is what
I believe your generation says.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.518
But I'm embarrassed by it.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.856
I mean, I do feel like
a caveman talking about it.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.122
But I'm sorry, that's just...
that's the deal.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.788
- Bullshit.
- It's not.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.197
It's not enough that you can't treat me
like a professional.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.757
You gotta add insult to injury
like some frat boy

04:17.790 --> 04:19.326
with this misogynistic bullshit.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.737
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Liar.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.805
(sighs)
Okay, then.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.648
That's right, you make me
as hard as cement.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.150
And I can't stop it, okay?

04:33.172 --> 04:37.211
I thought about war,
dead babies, country music.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.382
Dead babies at war
playing country music.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.857
Nothing works.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.383
The other lady reporters,
some of them are hot, but I can deal.

04:43.416 --> 04:47.159
But you go right past my brain to
my anatomy, and it is freaking me out.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.723
I mean, I'm this hard right now
and I'm yelling at you.

04:49.756 --> 04:52.498
I'm sorry, but I can't blast wood
in the locker room.

04:52.525 --> 04:53.970
I'll never hear the end of it.

04:53.993 --> 04:56.633
This is the biggest that my dick
has ever been.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.473
Is now a good time to say
we're off-the-record?

04:59.499 --> 05:01.445
Sit down. Please.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.845
(sighs)

05:03.870 --> 05:06.180
First, may I say

05:06.205 --> 05:08.742
you've certainly been
drinking your protein shakes.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.277
(Cam chuckles)

05:10.310 --> 05:13.291
And second, since you've
been honest, I will be, too.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.123
I have the same reaction to you.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.561
Okay, now who's playing?

05:18.584 --> 05:21.064
I come clean with you,
I humiliate myself,

05:21.087 --> 05:23.590
and this is all
just some joke to you?

05:31.397 --> 05:34.776
Is that...
Did you spill something?

05:34.801 --> 05:36.781
Yes... myself.

05:36.803 --> 05:39.579
I mean, some of it is probably
from the water bottle

05:39.605 --> 05:42.313
sitting in between my legs--
con... condensation.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.151
But the rest of it's me.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.679
I didn't know women work that way.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.555
I don't speak for other women,
just myself.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.027
Probably shouldn't have worn chinos
today, because the state of your arousal

05:51.050 --> 05:53.155
is impacting me
a little bit more than usual.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.223
- Holy shit.
- Stop congratulating yourself.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.530
- Okay.
- Our bodies are sending us messages

05:57.557 --> 05:59.059
and it's perfectly healthy.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.572
I mean, apart from
the staggering embarrassment.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.632
But we both have jobs to do here.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.268
So now we have two choices.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.677
One-- stay out of each other's way
in the locker room

06:08.701 --> 06:10.681
and do all our interviews
over the phone.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.683
Or two--
we get this out of our systems.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.618
- How do we do that?
- We find a private space

06:15.641 --> 06:17.746
and let our evolutionary
hardwiring take over.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.916
(whispers)
Like, we have sex?

06:19.946 --> 06:22.984
Jesus, it is a good thing
we're physically compatible,

06:23.015 --> 06:24.961
because intellectually,
this is a disaster.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.964
You would...
you would sleep with me?

06:26.986 --> 06:29.967
- Like that... that's on the menu?
- Think of it more as an exorcism.

06:29.989 --> 06:33.937
- When?
- I got 45 minutes before my podcast.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.338
(music playing)

06:42.602 --> 06:44.980
Okay.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:00.887 --> 07:03.959
(Cam grunting)

07:03.990 --> 07:06.630
(both moaning)

07:21.507 --> 07:23.544
All right.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.613
Very good.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.853
So would you say last night

07:31.884 --> 07:34.990
was your finest game
in an Atlanta uniform?

07:35.021 --> 07:37.467
(sighs)
We're really gelling as a team.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.333
I think that's all that matters.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.998
People say you don't care
about defense, is that true?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.975
Wait a minute.

07:44.997 --> 07:47.671
I don't think the exorcism worked.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.671
Jesus.
Don't you have a refractory period?

07:51.704 --> 07:53.547
I don't-- I don't know what that is.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.177
- Never mind.
- Okay.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.620
(music playing)

08:00.646 --> 08:02.887
(both breathing heavily)

08:02.915 --> 08:05.452
(music playing)

08:18.464 --> 08:20.307
(laughing)

08:20.333 --> 08:22.210
It's your night,
it's your night, baby.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.181
What kind of name is "BiShou"?

08:24.203 --> 08:26.376
It's Chinese for "the dagger."

08:26.405 --> 08:28.146
Why they have to give it
a Chinese name?

08:28.174 --> 08:29.448
'Cause they selling it in China.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.455
Well, why the fuck
we didn't have a party in China?

08:31.477 --> 08:34.253
Hey, calm down, Uncle J, they got
hors d'oeuvres and the women are hot.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.783
Well, you know,
I'm kinda confused about Asian women.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.193
I don't know if they submissive
or just bored.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.289
- Plus I heard they straight.
- Not all of 'em.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.324
I ain't talking about the woman,
I'm talking about the hair.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.927
- The hair underneath.
- I got it, I got it.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.598
And so the Chinese dagger
takes its place

08:48.628 --> 08:51.541
alongside numberless
other violent sports metaphors--

08:51.564 --> 08:54.477
bomb, gunned down, blitz.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.002
Do you know what the blitz was?

08:56.035 --> 08:59.505
267 nights of bombs
dropped on the English.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.782
- They got all the dentists.
- I mean, what are we saying, hmm?

09:02.808 --> 09:05.049
That there's a barbarian
inside all of us

09:05.077 --> 09:07.079
looking for some sneaky
little way to come out?

09:07.113 --> 09:08.854
- Exactly.
- Hey!

09:08.881 --> 09:11.794
Inside of everyone
lurks the desire to kill,

09:11.817 --> 09:13.763
but murder is impractical.

09:13.786 --> 09:16.460
- So instead, we play basketball.
- Hello, Chen.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.867
Welcome, my American
boots on the ground.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.395
Yo, man, I just gotta say this is
a really dope sneaker release.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.772
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks for not charging us extra

09:24.797 --> 09:27.038
- for that duck sauce.
- Everything is complimentary.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.979
- Hell, yeah. What about the hoes?
- We call them consorts,

09:30.002 --> 09:32.346
and what they choose to do
is their business.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.749
Please, eat, drink, mingle,

09:34.774 --> 09:37.653
and affect an air of
world-beating nonchalance.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.453
Cam, I'll meet you on
the black and gold carpet,

09:40.479 --> 09:42.789
where together we will be
mauled by photographers.

09:42.815 --> 09:45.261
- Arigato.
- That's actually Japanese.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.558
- Julius: Oh, yeah.
- Oh, Reggie.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.156
- Yeah.
- Please, linger with me.

09:48.187 --> 09:51.100
How do you retain a fact
like that 267-night thing?

09:51.123 --> 09:53.865
Impressive, but weird.

09:53.893 --> 09:55.873
Like Asian women.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.569
- Straight. Straight.
- (laughing)

10:00.199 --> 10:03.703
I see everyone here
but the fire of my loins.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.080
- I'm sorry, who?
- The queen of my fantasies.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.210
The song of my south.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.117
- Your aunt, you idiot.
- Oh. Oh!

10:10.142 --> 10:12.383
I didn't realize that you two
had gotten to that point.

10:12.411 --> 10:15.858
Neither has she,
but I believe she is my other.

10:15.881 --> 10:19.624
Since I laid eyes on her, I'm like
a boy again in Jiangsu Province,

10:19.652 --> 10:23.190
hearing for the first time
the Kangding Love Song.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.259
(singing in Chinese)

10:30.262 --> 10:33.209
Forgive me.
I'm just so moved by her.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.508
Yeah, no, my aunt,
she's coming in a separate car.

10:35.534 --> 10:37.377
Did she tell you we've been texting?

10:37.403 --> 10:39.542
We don't really discuss,
like, who's texting...

10:39.572 --> 10:42.678
It is amazing how seductive
the right woman can be

10:42.708 --> 10:45.746
using only phonetic
sentence fragments and emojis.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.782
Helped by the new iPhone update
to include more races.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.091
- Listen, Chen, I...
- Cassie makes me smiley face.

10:52.118 --> 10:55.224
And she liked the flowers I sent her
when she was in the hospital.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.393
She felt like Faith when Biggie died.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.460
But you should know
that she has a boyfriend now.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.166
Good. I'm pleased that
other men are drawn to her.

11:02.194 --> 11:03.264
It heightens the challenge.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.241
No longer a challenge
is what I'm saying.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.574
- At this point, more of a no-fly zone.
- No such thing.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.740
Unless we're discussing
the East China Sea.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.408
- Is this him?
- Yep.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.975
Oh, a kind face.
Nurturing and respectful.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.953
- He truly cares for her.
- Yes, he does.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.320
He stands no chance.
Cassie!

11:19.345 --> 11:21.120
Blair Thompson, Da Chen Bao.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.457
- May I offer you both champagne?
- What kind do you have?

11:23.482 --> 11:25.155
- We only drink the best.
- I have the best.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.664
- Whoo!
- Reggie will squire you to the bar.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.725
Let's all put in a firm base layer
of alcohol, hmm?

11:34.527 --> 11:37.030
You have never looked more beautiful.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.475
Mm, easy there, Crouching Tiger.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.978
You're talking to a lady
that's in a relationship now.

11:42.001 --> 11:45.448
The plus-one? And yet you did not
introduce him as your boyfriend.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.782
- I was being discreet.
- You were keeping your options open,

11:48.808 --> 11:51.414
- which means you do not love him.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.185
It's much too early for that.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.421
At our age, one knows quickly,
because one hasn't time to waste.

11:56.449 --> 12:00.522
"Our age"? How the fuck old are you,
you presumptuous fuck?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.966
- 37.
- Oh. Okay, then.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.492
For the best women,
age brings power.

12:06.525 --> 12:09.734
Well, Chen, don't you
want me to be happy?

12:09.762 --> 12:13.209
More than anything.
But I want it to be with me.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.645
Chen, you live in Shanghai.

12:16.669 --> 12:20.617
Fortunately, I have mastered
the miracle of flight.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.247
Unlike many of
the national airlines of my region.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.155
Well, I need a man
that's gonna be with me,

12:27.179 --> 12:29.716
not some ghost who comes and goes.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.059
Nothing's off the table, Cassie.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.722
Really?

12:33.753 --> 12:37.030
Consider my sedge hat
still firmly in the ring.

12:37.056 --> 12:41.004
(laughs)
Chen, Chen, Chen.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.973
I don't know what the fuck
a sedge hat is, but thanks.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.744
Ooh, can you get me a chicken satay?

12:47.767 --> 12:52.341
I will get you a chicken satay factory.

12:52.371 --> 12:54.408
(music playing)

12:57.676 --> 12:59.713
(breathing heavily)

13:18.798 --> 13:20.937
How am I supposed to
get this out of my system

13:20.966 --> 13:23.469
when I don't want to
get out of your system?

13:23.502 --> 13:25.573
It was just a theory.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.641
(both laughing)

13:30.910 --> 13:33.618
(camera clicking)

13:40.786 --> 13:42.732
(clicking continues)

13:49.261 --> 13:51.969
Chen has an undeniable charm.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.806
Reggie:
It's a simple request, Auntie.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.677
- Please don't shit where you eat.
- It's a stupid rule.

13:56.702 --> 13:59.546
Don't shit where you eat.
Don't shit where you sleep.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.280
Pretty soon the whole world's
gonna be constipated and alone.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.652
- And what happens when it ends?
- Who says it will?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.452
Any casual observer
of your datin' record.

14:06.478 --> 14:09.049
Which leaves us with a pissed-off
Chinese billionaire

14:09.081 --> 14:10.617
who owns half the paper
on our lives.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.526
What's that mean?
"Half the paper"? Half what paper?

14:12.551 --> 14:15.054
- The money, the future, etcetera.
- Oh.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.089
Well, maybe it'd be him
that dumps me.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.796
Maybe, but it's my job
to look at the worst case.

14:19.825 --> 14:22.738
And in this case, the worst case
is a very bad case.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.002
Cassie, you have to be careful
with those rich men.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.375
They will wow you and wow you,
and you are so busy being wowed

14:28.400 --> 14:29.970
that you can't even tell
if you actually like them.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.448
- That's true.
- Fuck you know? You a lesbian.

14:32.471 --> 14:36.419
Rich lesbians the same-- Cleopatra,
Eleanor Roosevelt, Kate Middleton.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.921
Princess Kate ain't gay.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.684
I know she got kids,
but let's be honest,

14:39.712 --> 14:41.885
- no breeder wears that many blazers.
- (clicks tongue)

14:41.914 --> 14:45.691
- And what happens to trusty Blair?
- Everybody knows nice guys finish last.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.163
Unless they have huge dicks.

14:47.186 --> 14:50.395
No, if they have huge dicks,
they finish last with a huge dick.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.527
Well, at least they can feel better
about themselves.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.334
Actually, if they have huge dicks,
sometimes the dick part finishes first

14:55.361 --> 14:57.170
even when the rest of 'em
finishes last.

14:57.196 --> 15:00.700
- Can we stay on message, please?
- It's like when I met you, baby.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.441
The sun comes out,
and it's all you care to see.

15:03.469 --> 15:06.814
I feel like Audrey Hepburn
in that "Roman Holiday"...

15:06.839 --> 15:10.844
unable to reach for happiness because
it would put her entire kingdom at risk.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.878
We need another guy
in this conversation.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.982
- Where's Tim at?
- Todd.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.892
- Ted.
- Ah, shit.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.420
- Who the fuck is Audrey Hepburn?
- One of the first actresses

15:20.452 --> 15:22.728
I ever saw on bootleg.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.827
(music playing)

15:30.329 --> 15:32.866
I'm not sure that the pictures
were necessary.

15:32.898 --> 15:36.277
I take my Easy Rawlins
responsibilities serious.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.441
Besides, the girl was hot.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.575
I'ma take 'em for my personal archives.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.279
No. No, delete 'em.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.652
And we gotta take 'em
off the fuckin' Cloud now, too.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.179
Deleting 'em is taking 'em
off the Cloud.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.350
Nah, deleting 'em
don't do shit to the Cloud.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.224
Things in the Cloud live forever.
The Cloud ain't really a cloud.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.629
It's a server in Douglas County
with a 23-year-old bath salt addict

15:54.653 --> 15:57.827
standing next to it
with Deadspin on speed dial.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.837
Jesus, this whole family,
they can't wait to shit where they eat.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.669
I admit, I have farted in the kitchen,
but that's where it ends.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.769
Reg, in the boy's defense, I've seen
a lot of people fuck in my life.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.440
I seen short people fuckin',
fat people fuckin',

16:10.469 --> 16:14.349
midgets fuckin', crippled, blind,
crazy, all of 'em fuckin'.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.717
I seen a lot of people fuckin'.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.951
I even seen myself fuckin'
once or twice in the mirror.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.789
I put mirrors on the ceiling
so I could see myself fuckin'.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.123
And the thing about fuckin' is...

16:24.149 --> 16:26.459
Can you please get to the end
of this paragraph?

16:26.485 --> 16:29.932
Oh, yeah. Cam and that woman, there's
something crazy going on between them.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.060
I mean, they was fuckin'
like the law was coming.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.627
No, I get it.
I get it, Uncle Julius.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.366
I mean, you have to
let it take its course

16:35.394 --> 16:38.773
- like the affliction it is.
- Mm.

16:38.797 --> 16:40.674
- You dig?
- Yeah, I dig.

16:40.699 --> 16:41.939
Loverboy.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.004
(music playing)

16:45.804 --> 16:49.718
- (Cam laughing) Come on!
- Ahh!

16:49.742 --> 16:51.619
We should put some
mile markers back here.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.681
- Yeah, get right on that.
- (cell phone rings, beeps)

16:54.713 --> 16:58.661
- You looking for an interview?
- We need to talk.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.096
- You all right?
- I'll tell you when I see you.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.067
- Okay. Uh, lunch spot. 20 minutes.
- Okay.

17:04.089 --> 17:07.127
- (cell phone beeps)
- That would be the unmistakable sound

17:07.159 --> 17:08.398
of the other shoe dropping.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.407
How many times I gotta tell you
there are no free lunches?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.602
(door opens)

17:14.633 --> 17:18.012
- You know about us?
- Uncle Julius saw you in the garage.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.811
You had my own uncle tail me?

17:19.838 --> 17:21.545
Would you rather
it be some outside guy

17:21.573 --> 17:23.211
that would extort me
for pictures like Ted?

17:23.242 --> 17:24.242
- Tim.
- Shit.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.983
And I would rather you
let me live my life.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.354
Yeah, but you see
what happens when I do?

17:27.378 --> 17:28.824
Seven billion people in the world,

17:28.847 --> 17:32.488
6.9 billion of 'em would fuck you,
and you choose a reporter.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.464
You might as well stand
in the middle of Peachtree Street

17:34.486 --> 17:37.057
- and set your career on fire.
- I tried to stay away from her,

17:37.089 --> 17:38.261
but you made me go.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.896
You're Judas. As a matter of fact,
you're worse than Judas.

17:40.926 --> 17:43.634
- You're-you're Judas's pimp.
- That doesn't even make sense.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.164
And, Cam, why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

17:45.197 --> 17:47.768
It's embarrassing, man.
I feel like a fucking teenager.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.802
Well, you a teenage baby daddy now.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.441
- You think that's what it is?
- You didn't wrap up, did you?

17:52.471 --> 17:54.451
Yeah, they got a dispenser
at Burnside's.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.044
You should always have one on you,
and another one on you.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.352
In fact, you should have
a separate wallet for condoms.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.380
Man, she can't be pregnant.
She's like Mom's age.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.450
It's the 21 st century, okay?

18:03.482 --> 18:05.689
They got women in France
having babies in nursing homes.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.890
And the older they are,
the more dangerous it is.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.958
They have slow babies.
Down syndrome babies.

18:10.989 --> 18:13.060
- Ain't that the same thing?
- No, one's about the chromosome,

18:13.092 --> 18:14.571
the other one's just born stupid.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.663
Look, rule number one--

18:15.694 --> 18:17.731
don't fuck anybody you don't want
the whole world knowing about.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.039
Are you done banging on me
about shit already happened?

18:20.065 --> 18:23.740
- What you gonna do?
- The right thing.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.840
(scoffs)
Now?

18:27.272 --> 18:30.446
- Well, where you taking me?
- You will see.

18:30.476 --> 18:33.218
- I shouldn't have come.
- You came because you wanted to.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.158
- That don't mean I should've.
- Here we are.

18:36.181 --> 18:38.684
Motherfucker,
you bought me a chopper?

18:38.717 --> 18:42.187
No. Although I will
if that's what it takes.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.930
But first I thought we could
start with dinner...

18:45.958 --> 18:48.734
in Paris, France.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.297
A helicopter could go
all the way to Paris, France?

18:51.330 --> 18:53.537
No, it would plunge into the Atlantic.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.943
But it can go to the airport

18:55.968 --> 18:58.073
where my jet will take us
to Paris, France.

18:58.103 --> 19:01.050
Where together, we will dine
at the Plaza Athénée.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.677
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.449
Slow down, lowdown, okay?

19:04.476 --> 19:06.513
Let a little steam
out of the soup dumpling.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.786
(Cassie sighs)

19:08.814 --> 19:10.589
Chen, we-- we need to talk.

19:10.616 --> 19:14.120
In China, when a woman says
"we need to talk," it always bodes ill.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.064
Ah, that's every fuckin' country.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.092
Chen, what I'm trying to say
is that we have ties that bind.

19:19.124 --> 19:22.503
And as much as I would love
to reach out to you

19:22.528 --> 19:25.236
and see where this leads...
Damn, this is nice.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.437
I mean, what if it doesn't work out?

19:27.466 --> 19:30.538
I mean, could you imagine how much
trouble that'll cause for everybody?

19:30.569 --> 19:32.879
Imagine the best,
not the worst, Cassie.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.148
- Take a leap of faith.
- Yeah, well, most leaps of faith

19:36.175 --> 19:39.281
end up on the sidewalk.
(sighs)

19:39.311 --> 19:42.656
Chen, I think it's best
that we don't shit where we eat.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.059
I've never enjoyed that metaphor.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.929
It puts defecation on the same plane
as the search for love.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.561
I agree, no one should yield
to simple lust

19:52.591 --> 19:54.798
in one's home or place of business.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.999
Now that is shitting where you eat.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.168
I would never do that.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.269
But when love is possible,

20:01.300 --> 20:04.474
its pursuit must not be equated
to solid waste

20:04.503 --> 20:07.677
sliding out of the rectum.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.482
Love is grander than that.

20:10.509 --> 20:14.355
How are we meant to find those
we might truly care for?

20:14.379 --> 20:17.223
On social media?
So artificial.

20:17.249 --> 20:22.164
Is it not wiser to trust
honest, organic exposures?

20:22.187 --> 20:25.634
To friends,
to business partners,

20:25.657 --> 20:28.604
or to their stunning mothers.

20:28.627 --> 20:31.335
All right,
so what you're saying is

20:31.363 --> 20:34.105
when there could be love,

20:34.132 --> 20:36.544
we have a moral obligation
to take a shit?

20:36.568 --> 20:39.048
To give a shit.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.108
Give us one date.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.551
A few hours in each other's company

20:43.575 --> 20:46.988
to speak as adults
and assess the possibilities.

20:47.012 --> 20:50.118
After that, if you still feel the same,
I will demur.

20:50.148 --> 20:52.822
- You will de-what?
- Step aside.

20:56.321 --> 20:59.734
One date.
And not in Paris, France.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.829
'Cause I've seen that
Liam Neeson "Taken,"

21:01.860 --> 21:05.307
and I don't go for that bullshit.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.334
I wanna judge
based on substance, not style,

21:08.367 --> 21:10.404
so it'd have to be
somewhere here in town

21:10.435 --> 21:12.676
at the least fanciest place
that we can find.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.913
So you either take that shit
or you leave it.

21:15.941 --> 21:20.617
Even a greasy spoon
is Alain Ducasse

21:20.646 --> 21:24.560
if I... am with you.

21:24.583 --> 21:28.292
You say weird shit...

21:28.320 --> 21:30.732
but I like it.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.827
(music playing)

21:36.595 --> 21:40.771
- There is no good way to say this.
- I'm prepared to take care of the kid.

21:40.799 --> 21:45.009
(chuckles) Okay, first of all,
I wouldn't know this fast.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.483
And second, pregnant?
Are you kidding me?

21:47.506 --> 21:50.419
- I'm 47 years old.
- Wikipedia says 41.

21:50.442 --> 21:51.750
Yes, I know, I wrote it.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.882
Man, you're even hotter
than I thought.

21:53.912 --> 21:57.416
Where does your generation
learn how to talk to women?

21:57.449 --> 22:01.397
Never mind. I'm sorry.
You're not pregnant. That's good news.

22:02.821 --> 22:07.634
I have HPV.
Which means you might have it, too.

22:10.662 --> 22:14.269
- I don't know what HPV is.
- Seriously?

22:14.299 --> 22:18.372
I-I mean, doesn't sound
like something that I want.

22:18.403 --> 22:22.374
I'm pretty sure things named
with three letters aren't good.

22:22.407 --> 22:25.786
Any chance it stands for
"happy perfect vadge"?

22:27.212 --> 22:30.887
How is someone in your position not
better informed about health matters?

22:30.916 --> 22:32.657
I mean, I don't know about
brain surgery either.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.755
You're not sticking your brain
in someone else.

22:36.555 --> 22:40.662
HPV is a sexually transmitted virus.

22:41.827 --> 22:45.172
So HPV is like HIV for the pussy?

22:45.197 --> 22:47.234
No, it is not HIV for the...

22:48.834 --> 22:50.438
(softly)
It's an STD.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.416
- Some strains cause cancer.
- I'm gonna get dick cancer?

22:53.438 --> 22:56.282
But this one is just the nuisance kind.

22:56.308 --> 22:58.083
How did you get this nuisance?

22:58.110 --> 23:01.182
80% of the population actually
has it in one form or another.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.523
You fucked 80% of the population?

23:03.548 --> 23:06.529
I have been with three people
in three years.

23:08.653 --> 23:12.430
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know I had it.

23:12.457 --> 23:14.801
I'm not an avid reader of my vagina.

23:14.826 --> 23:18.137
But this morning at my checkup,
my doctor saw something.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.666
Um, I don't know what to say.

23:20.699 --> 23:22.770
Thank you for telling me.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.077
Every animal has its natural enemies.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.810
For man,
once it was woolly mammoths,

23:26.838 --> 23:28.840
then it was Germans,
now it's viruses.

23:28.874 --> 23:32.720
So me getting this is just
God thinning out the herd?

23:37.816 --> 23:39.989
At least I'm not a daddy.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.831
Cassie:
Thank you. (giggles)

23:49.861 --> 23:51.738
Thank you.

23:57.636 --> 24:00.139
(coughing)

24:07.512 --> 24:09.856
Ahem.

24:42.781 --> 24:45.193

- No, pours vinegar on your dick

24:45.217 --> 24:47.993
and then looks around for something
that makes him or her go, "Hmm."

24:48.019 --> 24:50.829
- ls there a shot for it?
- Yeah. Yeah, but, uh, you--

24:50.856 --> 24:52.767
Well, you gotta get it
before you get the HPV,

24:52.791 --> 24:54.464
and then you gotta never have had sex,

24:54.493 --> 24:56.598
and then you gotta have a different
strain than the one you got.

24:56.628 --> 24:58.608
Just say that there's
no fucking shot for it.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.337
Just trying to be comprehensive.

25:00.365 --> 25:03.039
Once the symptoms are gone,
then the HPV is gone?

25:03.068 --> 25:04.775
No, the symptoms could come back.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.840
- But if they don't, then I'm fine.
- They not sure.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.443
'Cause they think in most cases,
the virus leaves the body eventually.

25:09.474 --> 25:11.454
- How long is eventually?
- They're not sure.

25:11.476 --> 25:13.114
I mean, viruses punch
their own clock, Cam.

25:13.144 --> 25:15.317
If I'm wearing a condom,
then I can't give it to anyone.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.453
No, you still could via
the scrotum or pubic mound.

25:18.483 --> 25:19.826
What is a "pubic mound"?

25:19.851 --> 25:21.524
Hey, you might not
ever have symptoms.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.931
Which means I didn't get the HPV.

25:23.955 --> 25:25.127
- They're not sure.
- They're not sure.

25:25.156 --> 25:28.501
- Man, what kind of disease is this?
- The fucked up fuckin' fuckin' disease.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.303
What do we pay doctors for
if they ain't figured this shit out?

25:31.329 --> 25:33.366
80% of the population has it.

25:33.398 --> 25:35.344
And the other 20%,
nobody wants to fuck.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.347
You're not alone.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.475
- Do you have this?
- Fuck no. I'd kill myself.

25:40.505 --> 25:43.509
You're the fixer, Reg.
Fix this.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.988
