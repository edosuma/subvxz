00:02.629 --> 00:04.714
Brock, what
are you doing?

00:05.215 --> 00:07.592
Getting ready for surgery.
What's it look like?

00:07.842 --> 00:09.803
You're operating
on my sister.

00:10.762 --> 00:13.139
And my fiancÃ©e.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.058
You're drunk.
You could kill her.

00:16.226 --> 00:19.145
It's the only way
to stop my hands from shaking.

00:19.270 --> 00:20.689
I need to drink.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.191
For Anna.

00:23.316 --> 00:26.194
What about our baby?

00:26.903 --> 00:28.863
Our baby?

00:33.535 --> 00:38.915
Brock! Oh, my God! Brock, are you okay?
Brock, speak to me.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.628
Oh, my God!
I think he's really hurt.

00:43.753 --> 00:44.629
Cut!

00:45.255 --> 00:47.424
(BELL RINGS)

00:47.674 --> 00:48.675
(SIGHS)

00:48.800 --> 00:51.010
That was scary. I thought for a second
you were really...

00:51.136 --> 00:53.972
Then you're going to be the only one
in the world who did.

00:54.848 --> 00:56.474
This is ridiculous.

00:56.599 --> 00:57.559
That was great, Evan.

00:57.684 --> 00:58.685
No, it wasn't. It was crap.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.061
The fans are going to love it.

01:00.186 --> 01:01.855
The fans are crap. I'm crap.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.774
This whole damn show is crap!

01:04.899 --> 01:06.693
Sorry, not your fault.

01:38.641 --> 01:41.895
Where are you going?
My apartment's on the West Side.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.689
Excuse me, you need
to go the other way.

01:45.982 --> 01:47.859
Hey, did you hear what I said?

01:53.448 --> 01:56.284
What the hell's going
on here? What do you want?

01:56.868 --> 01:59.412
HOUSE: An autographed
picture would be nice.

02:00.789 --> 02:04.501
Oh, and I'm also going
to save your life.

02:46.042 --> 02:48.795
You might want to think about
repositioning the crosswalk.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.798
It's technically not a violation,
but the closer they are to the entrance,

02:51.923 --> 02:53.633
the more likely
they are to be used.

02:53.758 --> 02:54.843
Makes sense.

02:54.968 --> 02:57.595
Listen, I actually wasn't
expecting you until next month.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.057
Yeah, that's the problem with planned
visits, administrators plan for them.

03:02.433 --> 03:05.895
The most recent New Jersey
Hospital Accreditation requirements.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.689
Yeah, I'm familiar with...
(HORN HONKING)

03:15.613 --> 03:17.073
Who is that?

03:17.866 --> 03:20.827
I have no idea.
Shall we get started?

03:24.163 --> 03:28.418
Just let me go. I won't press charges.
I'll forget the whole thing.

03:28.543 --> 03:31.170
That's probably true,
seeing as how you have a brain tumor.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.050
You're that nut-job doctor
that keeps calling my publicist.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.720
Actually, I'm the nut-job
Head of Diagnostic Medicine.

03:38.845 --> 03:42.932
I run every day. I don't get headaches.
I'm fine. So, if you don't mind...

03:43.057 --> 03:44.601
Actually, I do mind.

03:44.726 --> 03:48.354
I don't care if you die,
but if Brock Sterling dies,

03:48.479 --> 03:51.941
Anna never finds out
he's the father of Marie's baby.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.318
Help!

03:53.443 --> 03:54.736
Help!

03:55.111 --> 03:57.947
We're gonna need
a wheelchair here!

03:58.573 --> 04:00.450
Look, in the last month,

04:00.575 --> 04:04.621
your average line reading has slowed
from 2.1 seconds to 2.9.

04:04.746 --> 04:06.706
You're pausing more,
always at the same interval,

04:06.831 --> 04:08.416
every seven to nine words,

04:08.541 --> 04:11.294
which means you're having trouble
reading one side of the teleprompter,

04:11.419 --> 04:12.587
which means a peripheral
vision problem,

04:12.712 --> 04:15.882
which means a tumor
in your occipital lobe.

04:17.717 --> 04:21.429
Just one test. If there's nothing wrong,
I'll take you right back home.

04:27.644 --> 04:30.939
Make it cab fare. I don't want you
anywhere near my house.

04:34.943 --> 04:36.986
Just put it in my spot.

04:37.862 --> 04:40.949
The Accreditation Board
is here to protect us and our patients.

04:41.074 --> 04:43.576
So, in dealing with
the onsite inspector,

04:43.701 --> 04:48.373
please behave as if it wasn't also an
enormous pain in the ass. Thank you.

04:48.623 --> 04:51.376
Chase, Foreman, Cameron,
up here, please.

04:55.755 --> 04:57.048
Why is House driving a limo?

04:57.173 --> 04:59.175
- Don't know.
- Don't have to know.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.927
Don't care.

05:01.052 --> 05:03.888
CUDDY: Wrong. Until this inspection
is over you're back on House-watch.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.390
Current case. Past cases.

05:05.515 --> 05:06.349
He doesn't have
a current case.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.642
I have a whole department.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.560
And are you going
to fire us if we don't?

05:09.686 --> 05:12.647
I was just asking
for your help.

05:16.150 --> 05:20.655
The last time I checked the ER, you had
the best-kept charts in the building.

05:20.780 --> 05:23.241
Last time I checked the 4th-floor
janitor's closet,

05:23.366 --> 05:24.701
I found House's charts.

05:24.826 --> 05:26.661
He hasn't filed anything
since you left.

05:26.786 --> 05:27.912
Now, House may not care

05:28.037 --> 05:29.956
whether this hospital's accreditation
gets downgraded,

05:30.081 --> 05:34.085
but the people who sign my paychecks do.
So, I repeat: Current. Past.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.712
He doesn't have
a current case.

05:35.837 --> 05:38.172
Did he tell you
about the limo?

05:38.756 --> 05:41.801
So, I just press this button
every time I see a light?

05:41.926 --> 05:43.845
Tells me where
your blind spots are.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.515
So, the twins,

05:47.932 --> 05:49.767
they're going to turn out
to be yours, aren't they?

05:49.892 --> 05:52.645
I told you, I can't
talk about that stuff.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.773
But you want to be
done with this, right?

05:57.859 --> 05:59.944
One's mine, one's Julio's.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.155
I knew it!

06:03.072 --> 06:06.743
Julio knocked her up before her appendix
burst. You got her after.

06:07.285 --> 06:09.370
How can you watch that stuff?

06:09.662 --> 06:10.788
Because it's awesome.

06:10.913 --> 06:14.667
It's preposterous, not one real moment
since I've been on the show.

06:14.792 --> 06:19.088
As opposed to shows that represent the
world exactly the way it is, like...

06:20.006 --> 06:21.090
Can't think of any.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.759
What's going on?

06:23.009 --> 06:27.638
Hospital is being inspected, and Cuddy
dispatched you to keep an eye on me.

06:28.848 --> 06:30.850
I just parked a Town Car
in an ambulance bay,

06:30.975 --> 06:34.395
and instead of ripping me one,
Cuddy acted like she didn't know me.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.814
It's either an inspection
or an aneurysm.

06:36.939 --> 06:37.774
What's the test say?

06:38.191 --> 06:39.859
As I suspected,

06:40.651 --> 06:44.197
you have significant losses in the upper
right quadrant of your visual field.

06:44.322 --> 06:45.281
Are you serious?

06:45.406 --> 06:46.616
No, it's a joke.

06:47.075 --> 06:48.326
Two guys go into a bar,

06:48.451 --> 06:50.536
and one has significant losses in the
upper right quadrant

06:50.661 --> 06:51.496
of his visual field.

06:51.621 --> 06:53.831
The other one says you're
going to need an MRI

06:53.956 --> 06:56.000
to confirm the type
and location of the tumor.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.086
That readout says
his vision's fine.

06:58.211 --> 06:59.087
HOUSE: No, it doesn't.

06:59.212 --> 07:00.463
Yes, it does.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.673
You lied to me?

07:02.799 --> 07:06.135
I kidnapped you, and you're surprised
that I lied to you?

07:06.761 --> 07:09.639
It just means that the symptoms
are intermittent.

07:09.764 --> 07:12.350
You come near me again,
I'm calling the police.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.228
You kidnapped him?

07:15.353 --> 07:18.564
It's sweet that I haven't lost
the ability to surprise you.

07:26.948 --> 07:28.324
Are you mocking me?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.118
My back. My back
is killing me.

07:30.243 --> 07:31.369
Don't care. Busy.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.829
Amber's damn mattress.

07:32.954 --> 07:35.623
Well, that sucks.
Don't buy a new one.

07:36.374 --> 07:38.668
Are you being sarcastic?
Because we are buying one.

07:38.793 --> 07:40.628
She's incapable of doing
anything that matters

07:40.753 --> 07:43.422
without turning it
into a zero-sum game.

07:43.548 --> 07:45.508
We're buying
a mattress. For us.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.177
Wow, I'm faster
than you right now.

07:52.807 --> 07:57.395
It's all about her and whatever hapless
salesman wanders into her sights.

07:57.854 --> 08:02.441
She's going to lie, steal and trade your
testes to get whatever she wants.

08:03.651 --> 08:07.905
Hold on. Just got to do something before
he dials the second "one."

08:11.492 --> 08:14.871
You're going to end up
humiliated, holding her purse

08:15.746 --> 08:18.708
and going home to sleep
on a new mattress you hate.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.418
What the hell are you doing?

08:20.543 --> 08:21.752
He needs a MRI.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.883
Give me one-millimeter slices
from the cortex down.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.928
Any particular reason you
decided to sedate a patient

08:31.053 --> 08:32.889
for a procedure that's
completely painless?

08:33.014 --> 08:36.601
Guy has a history of violent outbursts
during surgical procedures.

08:36.726 --> 08:38.144
Yeah, on TV.

08:39.145 --> 08:42.106
It's Evan Greer. He's the main stud
on House's soap.

08:42.231 --> 08:44.567
Frontal cortex
looks clean. No tumors.

08:44.692 --> 08:47.820
Increase the magnification
on the occipital lobe.

08:48.154 --> 08:51.115
You watch because you
like or because I like?

08:51.407 --> 08:53.075
I was unemployed. I...

08:53.201 --> 08:54.076
(Buzzes)

08:54.202 --> 08:56.787
Sorry, that's not an answer,
that's an apology.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.248
If we are ever to come out of the
darkness, we have to be proud...

08:59.373 --> 09:02.752
Occipital, frontal and temporal
lobes are clean, so is the optic nerve.

09:02.877 --> 09:04.837
Definitely no tumors.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.673
He's fine?

09:07.798 --> 09:09.425
And awake.
(EVAN GROANING)

09:11.677 --> 09:13.262
What should we tell him?

09:14.680 --> 09:16.933
See if you can talk
him out of suing me.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.647
He kidnapped me!
He drugged me!

09:22.772 --> 09:24.440
Perhaps you should
go out the back way.

09:24.899 --> 09:27.443
I'm not going anywhere
you people tell me to go.

09:27.693 --> 09:31.364
It's just someone of your
fame... I figured fans...

09:31.489 --> 09:34.617
You're trying to hide me.
You don't want me making a scene.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.494
The hospital is being
inspected today.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.204
And you want me
to do you a favor?

09:38.329 --> 09:41.457
Not us, our dean of medicine.
And House hates her.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.918
You'd be doing House
a favor by complaining.

09:45.044 --> 09:46.045
Oh.

09:48.506 --> 09:51.509
This hospital is staffed
with lunatics and criminals.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
Excuse me, where is Dr. Cuddy?

09:55.096 --> 09:57.348
It's my foot.
What did he do to me?

09:57.473 --> 09:58.349
What did House do?

09:58.474 --> 10:00.142
Nothing. I was with
him the whole time.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.061
It's numb. I can't feel it.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.150
I can't walk.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.784
Foot numbness has
a huge differential.

10:17.201 --> 10:21.539
That gets a lot narrower when you add
in peripheral-vision problems.

10:21.789 --> 10:25.334
Which gets a lot wider when there's no
proof he ever had a vision problem.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.003
KUTNER: So House was wrong
about the first symptom,

10:27.128 --> 10:28.671
but the guy just
happened to develop

10:28.796 --> 10:30.881
a second, unrelated symptom
a few hours later?

10:31.007 --> 10:33.676
He already kidnapped
and sedated the guy against his will.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.929
Makes sense he'd also do something to
numb his foot so he couldn't leave.

10:37.054 --> 10:39.890
But it doesn't make sense to include
a symptom that he caused

10:40.016 --> 10:42.393
in a differential he's
so desperate to solve.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.061
Unless he didn't
mean to cause it.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.898
Stick to the filing, sweetheart.
Let the doctors do the doctoring.

10:48.024 --> 10:49.608
Either toxins
or vitamin deficiency...

10:49.734 --> 10:50.860
I'm guessing, when
you drugged him,

10:50.985 --> 10:52.903
you didn't catch him
and ease him to the floor.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.156
He could've pinched a nerve
in his ankle when he fell.

10:55.281 --> 10:57.783
You need to run an EMG test
for motor nerve entrapment

10:57.908 --> 11:00.411
or the inspector
will own your ass.

11:00.995 --> 11:04.540
Kutner, leave the room,
wait 30 minutes,

11:04.665 --> 11:06.250
come back and tell her
the test was negative.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.878
Is it okay if I use that
time to do the test?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.588
Get out of here.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.090
And the rest of them can
help me with all this stuff.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.593
They're busy, which
is really annoying,

11:15.718 --> 11:17.720
because I wanted to be able
to say that they're busy

11:17.845 --> 11:19.930
for no other reason
than to screw with you.

11:20.431 --> 11:21.724
Research.

11:22.892 --> 11:23.893
(SIGHS)

11:24.685 --> 11:26.020
So the nut job was right?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.189
Usually is.

11:29.607 --> 11:31.275
He said I was dying.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.113
He's wrong a lot, too.
That's why we do these tests.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.700
Bet it's cool, you know,
being the star of a hit TV show?

11:40.451 --> 11:44.080
It's a daytime soap. it pretty much puts
me one step above dinner theater.

11:44.205 --> 11:45.915
Come on, you're
on TV every day.

11:46.040 --> 11:49.085
And who cares what the critics
think? Women love soaps.

11:49.335 --> 11:53.923
You get to take pride in your job,
feel good when you go home at night.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.966
You're entertaining people.

11:56.092 --> 11:57.093
I don't care.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.553
Then you've made
a strange career choice.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.555
Look, I'm pandering.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.142
I want to be part of something
that inspires people.

12:05.267 --> 12:09.063
So, quit. Find something
inspiring and do it.

12:09.188 --> 12:10.439
It's not that easy.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.565
Why not?

12:14.443 --> 12:15.986
Just isn't.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.702
<i>It's my heart, Doctor.
It's racing.</i>

12:23.953 --> 12:26.705
<i>I'm sure it's nothing.
You're a healthy woman, Marie.</i>

12:26.997 --> 12:29.208
<i>MARIE: Shouldn't you
examine me?</i>

12:30.376 --> 12:32.044
<i>BROCK: Why don't you
have Rico do it?</i>

12:32.169 --> 12:34.964
You can't tell me
you didn't notice that pause.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.674
Sorry.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.801
<i>She's never waking up.</i>

12:39.218 --> 12:42.263
This is a whole new
experience in super hi-def.

12:42.388 --> 12:44.890
I had no idea Marie
wore an underwire.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.017
It does sound a little forced.

12:47.143 --> 12:50.187
Could be stiffening in his tongue,
which is a symptom of myxedema.

12:50.312 --> 12:55.234
It's not the tongue. It's the dialogue.
I think I dated that nurse, though.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.238
No.

13:00.114 --> 13:02.366
What about the way he's
holding that stethoscope?

13:02.491 --> 13:05.077
The thumb and forefinger
are meeting at an odd angle.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.788
Could be a demyelination
from toxic exposure.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.123
Back it up.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.042
What's this, the AV Club?

13:12.168 --> 13:14.837
It's diagnostic.
Everything's under control.

13:14.962 --> 13:19.008
Yeah, excellent job
so far. House, outside.

13:21.010 --> 13:22.845
Keep watching.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.140
You'll never guess
what Rico's got in that box.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.851
<i>MARIE: Rico doesn't
even know I'm alive.</i>

13:29.351 --> 13:32.855
You have an obsession with an actor or
the character he plays. I feel for you.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.357
You need to work it out.
But I need you to do it

13:35.483 --> 13:39.195
when the hospital's accreditation,
and my job, are not on the line.

13:39.320 --> 13:43.324
You want the star of the hottest daytime
drama on TV to die in your hospital?

13:43.449 --> 13:47.203
No, I want you to cure him without
committing any more felonies.

13:47.328 --> 13:50.331
I can't do my job if you're going
to tie my hands like that.

13:50.456 --> 13:51.832
Fifty-one weeks
out of the year,

13:51.957 --> 13:55.836
I let you run around
like a monkey in a banana factory.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.881
All I'm asking is
that you tone it down for a few days.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.426
I want that TV.

14:02.551 --> 14:03.761
We're not bargaining.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.430
You want something. Either you're
bargaining or you're begging.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.349
Me keeping my job
is good for you.

14:08.474 --> 14:10.643
Yes, but it's better for you.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.145
I just want us to
be equally happy.

14:13.270 --> 14:17.024
EMG was negative for nerve entrapment.
Means the foot's a real symptom.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.734
It could be
vitamin deficiency.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.278
- Or a toxin.
- Or atherosclerosis.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.446
Or a toxin.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.156
Why is toxin a better idea?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.407
Might not be.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.701
We'll know after I'm finished searching
his set and dressing room

14:27.826 --> 14:30.746
for medically relevant stuff.

14:31.664 --> 14:33.123
Got to go.
Need a decision.

14:33.249 --> 14:35.167
You're not going to
cut your own throat.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.294
Yeah, that sounds like me.

14:37.711 --> 14:42.007
Test for heavy metals, organics, bio
toxins, and search the home.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.139
I liked the pillow-top.

14:49.265 --> 14:50.266
I like this one.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.145
Great taste. That model's
top-of-the-line.

14:55.271 --> 14:56.188
How much is it?

14:56.313 --> 14:57.898
$1,999.
It's a great price.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.985
- And what about...
- That's too rich for us.

15:02.111 --> 15:04.113
I don't know. You think...

15:04.905 --> 15:08.367
Honey, we can't afford that,
not with a baby on the way.

15:09.118 --> 15:10.995
Congratulations.
Your first?

15:11.495 --> 15:12.413
Yes.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.624
How about I knock 100 bucks off,
maybe throw in free delivery.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.585
Money's really
tight right now.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.212
I'm a law clerk, and my husband
just got laid off.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.257
He has an interview today.
Wish him luck.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.593
Good luck.

15:25.718 --> 15:26.885
Fingers crossed.

15:27.469 --> 15:31.181
We might be able
to afford $1,500.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.225
I'd have to check
with my manager.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.893
Thanks. I appreciate it.

15:46.030 --> 15:50.034
So, am I getting the hard mattress or do
I have to go to my job interview?

Whatever mattress you

Pack your manhood on ice,

You were so wrong.
She's letting me choose.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.817
"You choose" does
not mean you choose.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.694
<i>Really? It sounded like
"You choose."</i>

16:25.819 --> 16:30.157
I suppose it's possible she
meant "House is so, so wrong."

16:30.282 --> 16:35.829
It's a trap. It means, "if you love me,
you'll buy the one I want."

16:35.954 --> 16:37.998
Amber doesn't do
passive-aggressive.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.794
People who do aggressive
don't like to limit themselves.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.047
Could a leaky space heater
cause vision problems and numbness?

16:45.172 --> 16:48.008
He'd have gotten better at
the hospital. It's not a trap.

He's on this whole health kick
right now. Fruits, nuts...

17:10.572 --> 17:13.283
Did you take those
from his dressing room?

17:13.409 --> 17:14.493
No.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.287
You're not going to
marry Brock, are you?

17:17.413 --> 17:20.499
We've been waiting four years for him
to make it official with Anna.

17:21.417 --> 17:23.085
Are you really a doctor?

17:23.210 --> 17:26.130

So, no toxins on the set.
What about his regular life?

Unsavory friends?

17:32.803 --> 17:36.098
No, I've been out with him.
He's as vanilla as they come.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.558
And by "out" you mean...

17:37.891 --> 17:39.768
Well, I asked him on
a date last month.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.688
We went out a few times,
but we weren't right for each other.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.523
Too small or too large?

17:44.940 --> 17:48.402
(SIGHS) Is that
medically relevant?

I'm a doctor, and it's
relevant to me, so, yes.

17:51.864 --> 17:53.490
We never got that far.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.952
We made out awhile, then
he said he should go home.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.788
He's a real gentleman.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.211
Now, that'd be interesting.

18:08.547 --> 18:10.048
He's impotent.

18:12.593 --> 18:16.388
A steady diet of sunflower seeds
causes a B6 toxicity,

18:16.513 --> 18:20.267
which causes autonomic dysregulation,
which causes a wood-free existence.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.603
One bad night and a couple
of sunflower seeds

18:22.728 --> 18:24.313
and he's got autonomic
dysregulation?

18:24.438 --> 18:25.522
It's more than just one.

18:25.647 --> 18:29.443
He can't even remember the last time he
was able to salute. It's cool, huh?

18:29.568 --> 18:32.863
B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen, and
we didn't find anything at the house.

18:32.988 --> 18:35.449
So, all we have to do is filter the B6
out of his blood.

18:35.574 --> 18:37.117
Prep him for plasmapheresis.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.162
Just because he didn't salute
doesn't mean he can't.

18:40.496 --> 18:43.540
Can you find out where
that voice keeps coming from

18:43.665 --> 18:45.042
and tell it to get
out of my head?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.878
The impotence could be psychological.
He's depressed, hates his job...

18:48.003 --> 18:49.421
Plasmapheresis has risks.

18:49.546 --> 18:52.299
He should spend a night in the sleep
lab, see if he gets a reflex erection.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.344
Confirmation is for wimps
and altar boys.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.640
We don't need
to wait for a reflex.

18:59.765 --> 19:04.061
If he can't get engorged the way God
intended, then he can't get engorged.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.563
I'm not showing him my boobs.

19:06.939 --> 19:09.817
Lack of response to your

Your porn's in
the second drawer.

All set. Heart monitor, blood-pressure
monitor, and the one on his junk.

<i>The instruments will let us

I don't get this guy. He has the coolest
gig ever, but he's miserable about it.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.932
Probably figures quitting
won't do him any good.

Figures he'd be
unhappy anywhere.

in this job, right?

19:47.479 --> 19:48.480
Sure.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.899
Have you ever had a job
where you were miserable?

19:51.024 --> 19:53.652
I once sold men's fragrances
in a department store.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.654
And were you miserable?

19:55.863 --> 19:57.072
The pay was awful.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.283
It was a miserable job,
but you weren't miserable.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.037
So, what about you?
Are you happy?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.664
Not particularly.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.375
Heart rate
and BP are climbing.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.752
Got some activity on the tumescence
monitor, as well.

20:10.878 --> 20:14.506

naughty. It's not B6 toxicity.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.108
He's headed
for cardiac arrest.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.285
We shocked his heart back
into sinus rhythm.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.953
He's stable, at least for now.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.955
Could be some sort of
atypical septic reaction.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.457
Not without a fever.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.375
Thus the word "atypical."

20:50.500 --> 20:52.794
In that case, it could
be an atypical bunion.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.754
He used to smoke.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.381
Could be paraneoplastic syndrome caused
by small-cell lung cancer.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.759
He quit 20 years ago, and his calcium
levels are normal.

20:58.884 --> 21:00.010
Could be Graves' Disease.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.970
Extreme hyperthyroidism

and cardiac arrest.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.818
Smart move. I was bluffing.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.448
She's right. We should fry the
thyroid before it fries him.

21:22.407 --> 21:26.495
I know it's more exciting this way,
but shouldn't we confirm you're right

21:26.620 --> 21:29.581
before destroying one of the most
important glands in his body?

21:29.706 --> 21:32.626
If that gland has drawn a bull's-eye
on his heart, then, no.

21:32.751 --> 21:34.544
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk

21:34.670 --> 21:37.214
for vascular lesions
and all kinds of cancer.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.424

Anyone else want
to run a useless test

21:44.429 --> 21:47.766
while Brock's thyroid plots
its next lethal move?

21:50.852 --> 21:52.145
It was rhetorical.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.690
You were sure about
B6 toxicity, too.

21:58.652 --> 22:02.781
Seriously? I mean, I am,

22:03.740 --> 22:06.952
If he goes into full-on

We got to nuke his thyroid.

Why? If we're going
to nuke his thyroid...

We're not nuking the guy's thyroid
without proof that it's Graves'.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.011
Do the iodine uptake test.

- When House finds out...

22:26.263 --> 22:27.514
We'll have the test results.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.767
And we'll either do his
procedure or we won't.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.490
What are you doing here?

22:45.615 --> 22:46.950
Just grabbing a snack.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.745
You keep food in the morgue?

22:49.870 --> 22:52.039
If I keep it in the lounge,
everyone else eats it.

22:52.456 --> 22:55.208
That's because it's
everyone else's food.

22:56.460 --> 22:59.171
I thought it was just
everyone else's bags.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.007
The Accreditation Board
will light us on fire for this.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.468
They're not going to find out.

23:04.593 --> 23:06.845
Unless, of course, Conway planned on
inspecting the morgue

23:06.970 --> 23:09.181
in, say, two minutes.

23:10.891 --> 23:11.975

You're going to get me fired
over a sandwich?

23:14.352 --> 23:18.607
No, over a TV. And you're not going to
get fired because you're going to fold.

23:18.732 --> 23:20.192
No, I won't.

23:20.317 --> 23:23.612
But you're going to push it,
so we need a safe word,

23:24.446 --> 23:27.407
so you can signal
your unconditional surrender.

Call me "sweet sauce."

Dr. Jamie Conway.
I've heard your name.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.000
Most people have.
It's also a noun.

23:39.836 --> 23:43.757
I sometimes come down here to relax,
unwind, maybe grab a...

23:43.882 --> 23:45.342
Sweet sauce.

23:47.344 --> 23:48.595
It's a nickname.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.971
An ironic nickname.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.560
Wow, it is almost 2:00.
Aren't you supposed to be...

23:56.520 --> 24:00.190
Oh, yeah. Yeah, 'cause those
sick blind kids

24:00.315 --> 24:01.858
aren't going
to read to themselves.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.027
See you.

24:11.201 --> 24:17.165
I recommend skipping C26. Floater, been
in the river at least a week.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.543
- Thanks for the warning.
- Any time.

24:29.469 --> 24:33.306
Doesn't the doctors' lounge
have that same TV?

24:33.515 --> 24:37.686
No, they've got a 12-inch exactly like
the one that used to be in here.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.522
Your files are done.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.817
I'll be doing a dance of joy just as
soon as my leg is healed.

24:43.942 --> 24:45.318
Can you tilt that down?

24:45.443 --> 24:46.778
I know the paperwork
annoys you,

24:46.903 --> 24:50.240
but patient records are important.
You can't just let them sit there.

24:50.365 --> 24:53.034
I had to, in the
name of science.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.953
I let the crap pile up,

24:55.078 --> 24:58.582
then I see which team member
is most self-flagellating.

24:58.707 --> 25:01.168
Breaks down,
clears up the mess.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.629
Surprise was, it turned
out to be you again.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.884
You weren't even
registered as a competitor.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.636
- You miss me.
- You miss me.

25:11.970 --> 25:13.555
You hired Thirteen
to replace...

25:13.680 --> 25:16.349
Yeah, all pretty
girls are fungible.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.143
You're avoiding.

25:18.518 --> 25:23.815
I miss the job. I miss running around
playing private investigator.

25:24.149 --> 25:27.110
I miss the puzzles.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.363
Seriously, I'll fire Thirteen.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.867
Or Kutner, if you
think Thirteen is hot.

25:35.452 --> 25:36.995
I don't miss you.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.335
EVAN: That iodine left
a really weird aftertaste.

25:43.460 --> 25:46.379
That's the tracer in it. We'll have the
images in a couple minutes.

25:48.089 --> 25:49.966
You must do okay
with women, huh?

25:50.091 --> 25:51.801
I already asked him that.

25:52.969 --> 25:53.887
And?

25:54.387 --> 25:55.722
It's not all it's
cracked up to be.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.183
He feels unfulfilled.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.351
I doubt it.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.311
I'm lying?

26:01.978 --> 26:04.022
I used to be
a plastic surgeon.

26:04.314 --> 26:07.192
I'd talk about my work
as shallow and meaningless.

26:09.152 --> 26:14.241
Truth is, I loved every
boob job, every tummy tuck.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.953
Meaning doesn't
mean that much.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.580
But you're not a plastic
surgeon anymore.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.917
It's complicated.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.252
Are you happier?

26:27.087 --> 26:28.546
It's complicated.

26:28.672 --> 26:29.839
His thyroid looks normal.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.385
So, that's good
news, right?

26:33.843 --> 26:35.637
Everything look
too bright to you?

26:35.762 --> 26:36.846
It could be the monitor.

26:40.934 --> 26:44.187
It's not the monitor.
It's the iodine.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.358
It's everywhere.
His body's not filtering it.

26:48.483 --> 26:49.776
His kidneys are failing.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.366
I told you to
nuke his thyroid.

26:56.491 --> 26:59.619
It's a good thing we didn't.
Kidney failure means it wasn't Graves'.

26:59.744 --> 27:03.748
So, your test screwed me
and our patient's kidneys.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.292
You practically poisoned
him with iodine.

27:05.417 --> 27:08.169
Which he could have handled easily
if his kidneys were healthy.

27:08.295 --> 27:11.172
All we did was reveal a new symptom.
Usually you're all for that.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.842
It must be the rancid tinge
of betrayal that's put me off.

27:13.967 --> 27:14.884
You were wrong.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.845
So, tell me to my face.

27:17.137 --> 27:20.557
You've never hesitated before.
The board's turning you into a coward.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.517
I did it because it was
the right thing to do.

27:22.642 --> 27:23.893
You did it to pass
an inspection.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.645
Does it matter?

27:26.104 --> 27:27.856
Kidney failure on top of the other
symptoms

27:27.981 --> 27:29.524
points to an autoimmune condition,

27:29.649 --> 27:32.902
which means that any
of his other organs could be next.

27:33.236 --> 27:37.741
We've already started dialysis. We need
to run ANA's for autoimmune.

27:38.700 --> 27:42.078
You're right. You and the team
go measure the ceilings.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.247
Excuse me?

27:44.372 --> 27:45.999
Accreditation Board
guidelines state that

27:46.124 --> 27:49.085
no object can be less than
18 inches from the ceiling.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.253
Make sure we're in compliance.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.339
There's nothing in our office
that would be less...

27:52.464 --> 27:55.091
I don't mean us.
I mean the whole hospital.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.768
Let's see how
this baby handles.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.730
(WILSON BREATHING HEAVILY)

28:18.239 --> 28:20.992
- What?
- You bought the firm mattress.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.454
I thought that's
the one you wanted.

28:24.579 --> 28:26.039
It was.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.083
Why would you do that?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.209
Because...

28:31.419 --> 28:33.338
Is this a trick question?

28:33.463 --> 28:34.714
I left it up to you.

28:35.340 --> 28:38.093
You were supposed to get
the one you wanted.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.930
I got the one you wanted
because I love you.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.139
No.

28:47.394 --> 28:50.063
You did it because
that's what you do.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.232
With all your ex-wives,
you did whatever they wanted

28:52.357 --> 28:55.193
because it was easier,
and you ended up resenting them.

28:56.444 --> 28:58.196
Don't you dare do that to me.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.157
What, take care of you?

29:02.450 --> 29:04.077
Have you met me?

29:04.577 --> 29:06.579
I can take care of me.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.165
I need you to
take care of you.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.460
I have work to do.

29:15.755 --> 29:16.798
(SIGHS)

29:20.176 --> 29:21.886
You made it to page eight.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.474
"Mysterious Hospital
Visit for Soap Doc."

29:27.142 --> 29:29.853
Wow, I'll be sure to
send my mom a copy.

29:32.981 --> 29:35.775
They told me I have
an autoimmune disease,

29:35.900 --> 29:38.736
like Lupus or Sarcoidosis.

29:40.113 --> 29:42.615
That's what we're
here to find out.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.830
You really as good as everyone seems
to think you are?

29:49.205 --> 29:52.834
Are you really as miserable as everyone
seems to think you are?

29:52.959 --> 29:56.796
I just want to do
something that matters.

29:59.007 --> 30:00.842
Nothing matters.

30:00.967 --> 30:05.930
We're all just cockroaches,
wildebeests dying on the riverbank.

30:07.474 --> 30:09.392
Nothing we do has
any lasting meaning.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.603
And you think I'm miserable?

30:11.728 --> 30:14.814
If you're unhappy on
the plane, jump out of it.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.399
I want to,

30:18.693 --> 30:19.861
but I can't.

30:21.446 --> 30:25.033
That's the problem with metaphors.
They need interpretation.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.661
Jumping out of the
plane is stupid.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.955
But what if I'm
not in a plane?

30:32.790 --> 30:35.502
What if I'm just in a place
I don't want to be?

30:37.795 --> 30:39.797
That's the other
problem with metaphors.

30:39.923 --> 30:42.008
Yes, what if you're actually
in an ice cream truck,

30:42.133 --> 30:44.594
and outside are candy
and flowers and virgins?

30:44.719 --> 30:48.932
You're on a plane.
We're all on planes.

30:50.016 --> 30:54.479
Life is dangerous and complicated,
and it's a long way down.

30:56.731 --> 30:58.608
So, you're afraid to change?

31:00.360 --> 31:02.237
No, you're afraid to change.

31:02.946 --> 31:07.242
You'd rather imagine that you can
escape, instead of actually try,

31:08.576 --> 31:11.371
because if you fail,
you've got nothing.

31:12.413 --> 31:15.625
So, you'll give up the
chance at something real,

31:15.750 --> 31:17.544
so that you can
hold on to hope.

31:18.836 --> 31:21.881
Thing is, hope is for sissies.

31:25.426 --> 31:28.471
When I get out of here, I'm not going to
be afraid anymore.

31:30.265 --> 31:33.059
I mean, how many guys
get a second chance?

31:33.184 --> 31:38.064
Too many. Half the people
I save don't deserve a second chance.

31:38.189 --> 31:41.568
Now that I've got mine,
I'm going to set things right.

31:43.278 --> 31:47.657
I'm going to start by being a better
father to you and to your sister.

31:49.033 --> 31:51.202
- And to your other sister.
- And to your other sister.

lines from last season?

32:13.891 --> 32:16.394
Do you know where you are?
What's your name?

32:16.853 --> 32:18.521
Dr. Brock Sterling.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.155
THIRTEEN: Fever rules out autoimmune.
He's septic.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.197
He's got a massive infection.

32:28.323 --> 32:30.116
KUTNER: We've got him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

32:30.241 --> 32:32.619
but he's slipped from
delirium into a coma.

32:32.952 --> 32:36.497
Good news is last time Brock
was in a coma, he fathered two children.

32:36.623 --> 32:40.126
We need to identify the infection and
get him on more targeted meds fast.

32:40.251 --> 32:42.337
What about pneumococcus?
Causes heart problems and sepsis.

32:42.462 --> 32:45.006
But not the neuropathies in his foot
and eyes. What about tetanus? it fits.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.717
He got a tetanus booster
last year. Lyme disease?

32:47.842 --> 32:49.052
He would have
been sore all over.

32:49.177 --> 32:50.845
There's a thousand infections
that could have caused this.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.474
We can start testing, but
he'll be dead before the cultures grow.

32:54.599 --> 32:58.603
Unless it's a fungus. We could see that
under a microscope.

32:58.728 --> 33:02.482
Test for fungi, parasites,
all creatures great and small.

33:03.191 --> 33:06.527
- Where are you going?
- To lie down. I need to think.

33:10.448 --> 33:15.244
Could be rat bite fever,
but his glands aren't swollen.

33:17.664 --> 33:19.999
Which one are
you going to get?

33:20.249 --> 33:22.377
She told me to
get the one I want.

33:22.502 --> 33:23.544
So get it.

33:24.796 --> 33:29.509
Listeria explains the sepsis,
possibly also the heart problem.

33:29.634 --> 33:31.094
But not the numbness.

33:31.803 --> 33:33.763
If the listeria
caused encephalomyelitis,

33:33.888 --> 33:35.723
which then
caused the numbness...

I want a waterbed.

33:44.899 --> 33:46.109
Wow.

33:46.234 --> 33:50.405
I've always wanted one.
I know it's ridiculous, it's just

33:50.530 --> 33:54.450
there's something nice about the thought
of being rocked to sleep in water.

33:57.495 --> 34:00.957
No mocking? No Freudian analysis
of how the waterbed

34:01.082 --> 34:04.419
is really a great big vagina

I'm ignoring you
because you make me sad.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.550
He's on ampicillin,
which means if it was listeria,

34:10.675 --> 34:11.926
he would've shown
some improvement.

34:12.051 --> 34:16.389
No, it's a whole thing. You need special

34:16.514 --> 34:19.934
Who cares? You wanted
one your whole life.

You're a grown-up. You can afford it.

life like you do, House,

34:26.149 --> 34:27.900

34:28.317 --> 34:30.027
Then you don't
deserve to be happy.

34:30.153 --> 34:32.196
And yet I am. You?

34:39.245 --> 34:41.456
Amber will think it's stupid.

34:44.584 --> 34:46.127
It is stupid.

Live the dream, Wilson.

34:56.596 --> 35:00.475
It's not an infection.
It's an allergy.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.727
That's why it's not
responding to antibiotics.

35:02.852 --> 35:04.353
This isn't a soap opera,
House.

35:04.479 --> 35:07.231
People don't just wake up from comas
the second you give them drugs.

35:07.356 --> 35:10.485
Especially if we give them the wrong
drugs. What do the tests say?

35:10.610 --> 35:12.862
It was negative for fungus and
parasites, but that doesn't mean...

35:12.987 --> 35:14.906
The more infections we rule out,
the more likely it is

35:15.031 --> 35:16.073
that it's not an infection.

35:16.199 --> 35:19.243
He has no history of allergies
or asthma. Most importantly,

35:19.368 --> 35:22.205
none of his symptoms remotely
resemble an allergic reaction.

35:22.330 --> 35:24.624
Allergens could trigger
an allergic vasculitis.

35:24.749 --> 35:27.084
- That would explain the symptoms.
- One in a million times.

35:27.210 --> 35:29.128
Septic infection always
explains his symptoms.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.048
But an infection is never
resistant to every antibiotic.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.424
No, an infection
is rarely resistant.

35:33.549 --> 35:36.344
And allergy never responds
to antibiotics.

35:36.469 --> 35:38.846
"Never" beats "rarely." QED, I win.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.807
There were chrysanthemums
in his dressing room.

35:40.932 --> 35:43.351
My God, why didn't you say
he'd been exposed to plant life?

35:43.476 --> 35:47.230
Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrin.
It's a neurotoxin and a known allergen.

35:47.355 --> 35:50.858
He has an infection.
If we give him steroids, we'll kill him.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.277
He has an allergy. If we don't give him
steroids, we'll kill him.

35:53.402 --> 35:54.403
Not as fast.

35:54.529 --> 35:55.738
Fast enough.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.907
You don't have time for the rest of
the tests. We have to do something.

35:58.032 --> 36:00.326
And what we're doing
right now isn't working.

36:03.538 --> 36:06.290

Patients' names?

36:07.959 --> 36:09.377
It's one patient.

36:09.502 --> 36:13.214
You want to give one patient 100
milligrams? That'll jump-start a car.

36:13.339 --> 36:16.384
Perfect, my patient's
a '69 Ford Coma.

36:16.509 --> 36:19.053
Anything over 50 milligrams,
I need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy.

36:19.178 --> 36:21.264
It's protocol,
and the inspector's here.

36:21.389 --> 36:24.767
I am 99% certain
that she'll consent.

36:24.892 --> 36:27.436
But for the sake of the
1%, why don't I just...

36:27.895 --> 36:29.605
You're not allowed back here.

36:29.730 --> 36:32.191
Well, tell the inspector
he can put it on my tab.

36:37.697 --> 36:39.282
I didn't mean now.

36:50.251 --> 36:53.796
100 milligrams of methylprednisolone
is an overdose.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.381
We were wrong
about the infection.

36:55.506 --> 36:57.800
He's suffering from
a severe allergic reaction.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.177
The team hasn't finished
the test for allergy.

37:00.595 --> 37:03.222
- His symptoms don't...
- In rare cases...

37:04.098 --> 37:06.267
Trust me, at the end
of this conversation, I'm right.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.728
Then confirm it.
Get a blood test.

37:08.853 --> 37:12.398
What is it about this severe
and deepening coma

37:12.523 --> 37:13.941
that makes you think
we've got time for protocol?

37:14.066 --> 37:15.735
Protocol has saved your
patient from having his

37:15.860 --> 37:18.487
thyroid destroyed
and his blood drained.

37:18.905 --> 37:23.743
If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm
wrong. Don't talk about protocol.

37:27.079 --> 37:30.666
My job's on the line.
Your job is on the line.

37:33.711 --> 37:35.421
Okay, here's what you do.

37:36.172 --> 37:39.759
You wait three minutes,
then you call security.

37:39.884 --> 37:43.137
By the time they get in here
to lock me up, I'll be done.

37:43.262 --> 37:46.307
He gets to live. Your ass
gets to be covered.

37:52.021 --> 37:57.193
If he dies, let me know,
so I can pack my things.

38:47.743 --> 38:52.248
Tests are negative. Patient's negative
for all floral allergies.

38:54.917 --> 38:58.754
I'm going to restart
the antibiotics.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.134
If he's still alive.

39:12.852 --> 39:15.062
Ampicillin, two grams, IV.

39:16.689 --> 39:20.192
Why? The steroids worked.
House was right.

39:20.317 --> 39:21.318
The test was negative.

39:21.444 --> 39:22.778
FOREMAN: He was still right.

39:24.071 --> 39:25.573
It was an allergy.

39:25.698 --> 39:26.866
To what?

39:28.826 --> 39:30.036
Thank you.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.708
I was wrong.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.420
You should have stopped me.

39:43.883 --> 39:46.927
Heard about House's patient.
Bold move.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.431
And you backed him.

39:50.556 --> 39:51.640
He was right.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.977
He wasn't even in
the same neighborhood as right.

39:55.102 --> 39:56.103
The patient's alive.

39:56.228 --> 40:00.024
Okay, the rules exist
because 95% of the time,

40:00.149 --> 40:02.651
for 95% of people,
they're the right thing to do.

40:02.777 --> 40:04.695
And the other 5%?

40:04.820 --> 40:06.405
Have to live
by the same rules.

40:06.989 --> 40:09.825
Because everybody thinks
they're in that 5%.

40:12.661 --> 40:13.662
Okay-

40:14.622 --> 40:16.665
I noticed that Dr. Chase...

40:37.978 --> 40:39.939
What are you doing out here?

40:41.690 --> 40:43.859
I can't sleep.
I hate the waterbed.

40:48.989 --> 40:51.075
I actually kind of like it.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.952
No, it's awful.

40:54.787 --> 40:56.956
We're returning it tomorrow.

40:58.207 --> 40:59.375
Okay-

41:07.591 --> 41:08.634
(WILSON SIGHS)

41:10.511 --> 41:12.471
I'm glad you got it, though.

41:13.806 --> 41:14.974
Me, too.

41:18.102 --> 41:20.437
I hope they'll
take it back.

41:22.481 --> 41:23.983
They will.

you'd stop drinking.</i>

41:34.910 --> 41:36.912
<i>BROCK: Of course I'm drunk, Anna.</i>

41:37.037 --> 41:39.248
<i>They told me you'd never
wake up from that coma.</i>

41:39.373 --> 41:42.501
<i>But how could you get
engaged to my sister?</i>

41:46.839 --> 41:48.716
<i>We fell in love.</i>

41:49.717 --> 41:52.761
<i>What do you want from me,
Anna? I'm just a man.</i>

41:53.512 --> 41:55.055
<i>And I'm just a woman.</i>

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

42:17.578 --> 42:18.454
Hello.

42:18.579 --> 42:22.458
HOUSE: Don't hang up.
What was the verdict?

42:22.583 --> 42:23.959
$200,000 fine.

42:25.336 --> 42:26.795
You should have been fired.

42:26.921 --> 42:27.796
Good night, House.

42:27.922 --> 42:29.715
There are bubbles
in his glass.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.008
Can't this wait until...

42:31.133 --> 42:33.969
My patient.
He's allergic to quinine.

42:37.056 --> 42:39.016
And you got this from bubbles?

42:39.141 --> 42:41.060
<i>His symptoms started
two months ago.</i>

42:41.185 --> 42:43.771
That's also when Brock
started downing gin and tonics

42:43.896 --> 42:46.065
like
a Brit staving off malaria.

42:47.274 --> 42:49.818
Gin was fake,
the tonic was real.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.405
And tonic water
is loaded with quinine.

42:55.199 --> 42:56.492
Nice job.

42:57.159 --> 42:58.661
You should have been fired.

42:58.786 --> 42:59.995
I'm taking back the TV.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.288
I saved his life.

43:01.413 --> 43:02.498
That wasn't the deal.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.918
The contract clearly stated
no takesie-backsies.

43:06.335 --> 43:07.419
Good night, House.

43:07.544 --> 43:09.129
What are you wearing?

43:09.505 --> 43:12.383
- Good night, House.
- Good night, Cuddy.
