WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.060
-I'm a cop.

00:07.060 --> 00:08.100
-A cop?

00:08.100 --> 00:10.090
-I was undercover in Ortega's organization

00:10.090 --> 00:13.070
and I haven't come this far to let you get in my way.

00:13.070 --> 00:15.120
-The mayor knows it was Vic who tried to blow the vault.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.230
-Yeah, and he wants his head, and he wants me to take it.

00:18.170 --> 00:21.040
It's either Vic, or all of us.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.180
(panting)

00:22.180 --> 00:24.000
-I guess you've made your choice.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.050
(groans)

00:30.050 --> 00:31.210
-Well, look who we have here.

00:31.210 --> 00:34.040
Victor Hill, as I live and breathe.

00:37.110 --> 00:38.150
-(pounding on door)

00:42.170 --> 00:44.040
(pounding continues)

00:49.020 --> 00:50.010
-Hola.

00:51.020 --> 00:52.020
-Hola.

00:53.060 --> 00:55.020
-I seemed to have misplaced my phone.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.230
-It's good you came right over.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.180
We've got no time to lose.

01:05.220 --> 01:07.170
-We should probably just get straight to work.

01:07.170 --> 01:09.090
It could take all night to find that thing, right?

01:10.080 --> 01:13.090
-I always say work smarter, not harder.

01:13.090 --> 01:14.070
-Hmm.

01:15.150 --> 01:17.000
-(cell phone vibrating)

01:23.000 --> 01:24.080
-It looks like I came to the right room.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.060
-But how will we keep ourselves occupied all night,

01:30.020 --> 01:31.170
now that your mystery's solved?

01:33.130 --> 01:34.170
-Well, I've got an idea.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.170
-Hmm.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.030
-(theme music playing)

02:11.090 --> 02:12.130
-(cell phone chimes)

02:25.050 --> 02:28.040
-(peppy music playing)

02:32.150 --> 02:34.010
-♪ I've got to... ♪

02:35.150 --> 02:36.160
-Morning.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.180
-Charlie: Oh, morning.

02:42.140 --> 02:43.160
-Billy Ayers.

02:44.210 --> 02:46.040
So to what do we owe this pleasure?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.200
-I was hungry.

02:48.130 --> 02:50.040
-I knew Charlie was making breakfast.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.150
-Lotti: Mm, something smells good.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.030
What you cooking, Charlie?

02:53.030 --> 02:55.000
-Oh, good ol' English breakfast.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.090
-Hmm. Reminds me of home.

02:56.090 --> 02:57.080
-Well, this is our home now.

02:58.020 --> 02:59.110
If we've got any chance of staying here

02:59.110 --> 03:00.170
we gotta make our move today.

03:00.170 --> 03:02.160
I meet Tomas in one hour.

03:03.010 --> 03:04.110
If all goes according to plan,

03:04.110 --> 03:06.080
by this time tomorrow, Mayor Ortega is gonna regret

03:06.080 --> 03:07.150
the day he ever underestimated us.

03:07.150 --> 03:08.200
-I'll drink to that.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.030
-To the East London Locos.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.160
-To the Gold Bullion Banditos.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.100
-To getting away with it.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.020
-(Fanta laughing) -Hate 'Em: King  gambas.

03:19.020 --> 03:20.230
-Fanta:  Gambas.  -Finally here.

03:20.230 --> 03:22.070
-What's on the menu, boys?

03:22.070 --> 03:23.220
-Go on, Fanta, tell her.

03:24.070 --> 03:28.200
-Yeah, today's special,  senora,  is scampi over linguini pasta

03:29.100 --> 03:31.100
in a white wine and butter sauce,

03:31.100 --> 03:33.190
just flecked with a touch of parsley.

03:33.190 --> 03:35.100
-(kisses)  Perfecto.  -Fanta:  Perfecto.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.140
-Just listening to him say it,

03:37.140 --> 03:41.160
my taste buds dance like a discotheque.

03:42.150 --> 03:43.190
-Who are you?

03:43.190 --> 03:45.210
-Ramiro Ramirez, at your service.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.150
-He's all right, Mrs. H. He's one of us.

03:48.150 --> 03:49.110
-Yeah.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.230
-If you say so.

04:10.190 --> 04:12.030
-Doing here so early, Mum?

04:14.090 --> 04:15.130
-Have you heard from Vic?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.200
Is he okay?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.080
-Yeah, he's just texted me.

04:20.030 --> 04:21.060
He's at a motel.

04:23.010 --> 04:24.080
-That's strange.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.040
-What is?

04:26.040 --> 04:27.140
-Well, he hates clams,

04:29.110 --> 04:31.000
and he knows I'm not cooking dinner for him

04:31.000 --> 04:32.020
again any time soon.

04:33.010 --> 04:34.150
-Well, why aren't you gonna be cooking for him?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.200
-No reason, it doesn't matter.

04:38.150 --> 04:39.150
-Mum?

04:46.110 --> 04:47.070
-Albert...

04:48.040 --> 04:51.120
things aren't working out well with your dad right now,

04:51.120 --> 04:52.150
and I am...

04:53.140 --> 04:55.200
I'm struggling to see a future for us.

04:56.210 --> 04:59.160
After all these years, it seems that he's forgotten

04:59.160 --> 05:01.040
I exist and...

05:02.080 --> 05:07.220
I am standing in front of him screaming for him to see me and...

05:10.100 --> 05:11.070
(sighs)

05:14.230 --> 05:16.070
Albert, I need more.

05:16.070 --> 05:18.060
I-I know that now. I...

05:19.080 --> 05:20.150
I just need more.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.080
-Mum...

05:27.020 --> 05:29.010
do you remember when Blanco was holding you hostage?

05:30.190 --> 05:32.190
Dad lost his mind with worry.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.130
Okay?

05:35.050 --> 05:36.230
I've never seen him like that. He looked scared.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.210
You gotta know he loves you above everyone else.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.070
I don't know, maybe all this madness

05:47.070 --> 05:48.220
that he creates is his way of trying to make up

05:48.220 --> 05:50.200
for all the shit that he's put you through. I don't know.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.130
You know what, maybe...

05:54.150 --> 05:56.020
just maybe, you've been trying to change him

05:56.020 --> 05:57.110
a bit too much as well.

05:58.210 --> 06:00.060
At the end of the day, he always has been

06:00.060 --> 06:01.170
and always will be Vic Hill.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.150
Come here.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.100
I love you.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.220
-(sighs)

06:10.220 --> 06:12.140
Look at that, king  gambas.

06:12.140 --> 06:13.130
(sniffs)

06:16.010 --> 06:17.030
-You get those bits from Manny?

06:17.030 --> 06:18.070
-Yeah, they're in the office.

06:18.070 --> 06:19.130
-Come on, then, we've got work to do.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.050
Now, if you take that gun,

06:31.050 --> 06:32.100
you better be prepared to use it.

06:32.170 --> 06:34.190
-Oh, well, then I'll make sure I apply my lipstick

06:34.190 --> 06:35.230
before I shoot it then, shall I?

06:36.190 --> 06:38.150
-It's a shame Vic won't be in on the action.

06:39.070 --> 06:41.050
It's like the birthday boy missing his own party.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.050
-Yeah, well, Vic's present

06:42.050 --> 06:43.110
was not getting whacked by the mayor

06:43.110 --> 06:44.080
and I wrapped that myself.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.110
Let's get this done.

06:46.110 --> 06:47.150
We'll have nice story to tell him

06:47.150 --> 06:48.190
when he comes back from the dead.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.170
-(Vic groaning)

07:00.100 --> 07:02.180
-Take a minute to come to your senses, Mr. Hill.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.220
This chloroform kicks like a mule.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.140
-Who the fuck are you?

07:09.140 --> 07:11.050
-My name is William Picket,

07:12.010 --> 07:14.210
but more vital to our purposes here is not who,

07:14.210 --> 07:16.170
but what I am.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.110
-I know what you are.

07:20.180 --> 07:22.170
A long streak of piss.

07:23.050 --> 07:24.210
-How very true to form,

07:24.210 --> 07:27.020
and I'm very glad for it too, really.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.090
I would have hate to have come all this way

07:29.090 --> 07:31.100
and gone to all this trouble

07:32.190 --> 07:35.150
to have Vic Hill fail to meet my expectations.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.090
-What do you want with me?

07:38.140 --> 07:40.220
-Let's put you back to sleep for a little longer, shall we?

07:42.020 --> 07:44.150
I have a few things to organize before our journey.

07:44.150 --> 07:46.040
-What journey?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.100
Don't you fucking--

07:48.100 --> 07:50.060
(muffled yelling)

07:52.140 --> 07:53.160
-And there you go.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.160
Good boy.

08:04.070 --> 08:05.070
-(sighs)

08:05.210 --> 08:07.210
You don't like clams.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.220
Something's not right.

08:32.170 --> 08:33.210
-Well, here I am.

08:34.190 --> 08:35.180
What now?

08:35.180 --> 08:37.090
-Looks like you're in the circle of trust.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.110
We have an important job for you.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.230
-What's the job?

08:40.230 --> 08:42.020
-Patience, Albert.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.070
All will be revealed.

08:43.070 --> 08:44.130
Now, your phone.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.090
Hand it over.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.020
-You want my phone?

08:49.220 --> 08:50.210
(sighs)

08:59.040 --> 09:00.140
Well, let's get on with it then.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.050
-Get in your car. Follow us.

09:06.090 --> 09:07.110
-What a prick.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.200
-Okay, boys and girls, we're on the move.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.220
-Right, let's get you started, come on.

09:14.150 --> 09:15.160
-Right behind you.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.120
-Keep your distance.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.130
We don't want to spoil the surprise.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.030
Okay, this must be the place. Stand by.

09:51.030 --> 09:52.070
-Locked and loaded.

09:52.070 --> 09:53.180
-Ready and waiting.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.200
-Which one is it, Federico?

09:58.200 --> 10:00.070
-The one right behind me.

10:00.070 --> 10:02.100
-The diamonds? Where are they?

10:02.100 --> 10:04.200
-Locked in the safe. The office on the second floor.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.140
-Are we stealing diamonds?

10:07.160 --> 10:08.170
-You're stealing diamonds.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.100
Mayor Ortega seems to think

10:12.100 --> 10:14.130
you're well qualified for this particular job.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
We'll find out.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.040
The combination to the safe?

10:23.160 --> 10:24.190
-There's also a key,

10:24.190 --> 10:27.210
which hangs on the neck of the guard downstairs.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.030
-Federico will bring us in the front.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.080
We're new on the crew and he's giving us the tour,

10:32.170 --> 10:34.120
which will cover you as you break in from the rear.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.040
Get to the office and take the stones.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.220
The Hills are famous robbers, no?

10:40.220 --> 10:42.090
Just do what you do best.

10:45.190 --> 10:47.000
Okay, let's go.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.220
-Charlie: They're on the move. It's going down.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.150
-(speaking Spanish)

11:12.180 --> 11:15.100
-(indistinct chatter)

11:17.210 --> 11:19.110
-(speaking Spanish)

11:51.070 --> 11:53.040
-(video game sounds)

12:07.220 --> 12:08.230
-Huh?

12:12.030 --> 12:13.010
(groans softly)

12:32.100 --> 12:34.010
-Well, fuck me.

12:34.010 --> 12:35.090
-(indistinct conversation)

12:42.010 --> 12:43.150
-(gunshots)

12:44.120 --> 12:45.140
-Gunshots.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.010
-Gunshots? -Shit.

12:59.180 --> 13:00.210
-Now my work is done.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.150
My remaining five million.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.100
-Of course, Federico.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.000
-(groans)

13:09.000 --> 13:10.110
-Jesus Christ.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.070
I'll drop you first.

13:31.050 --> 13:32.110
-You didn't think I'd give you a gun

13:32.110 --> 13:33.230
with bullets in it, did you?

13:41.140 --> 13:42.130
On behalf of the mayor,

13:42.130 --> 13:44.110
let me extend our sincere thanks.

13:45.070 --> 13:47.090
And don't worry, we're not gonna kill you.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.080
We have something far more interesting planned.

13:57.050 --> 14:00.010
-Charlie: Okay, it looks like he's got the diamonds.

14:00.010 --> 14:00.230
Get ready to move out.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.230
-(car engine starts)

14:05.070 --> 14:07.230
-(grunting)

14:20.170 --> 14:21.140
-We need Albert.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.050
-Charlie: We need to follow the diamonds.

14:42.230 --> 14:44.020
-(groans)

14:46.020 --> 14:47.010
-Get up.

14:47.170 --> 14:48.180
Let's go.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.160
-You were the one the boys got to book the motel

14:57.160 --> 14:59.180
for  Senor Vic  , weren't you, Fanta?

14:59.180 --> 15:01.210
-Si, Senora Lily  . Did I do wrong?

15:01.210 --> 15:03.040
-No, no, no, of course not.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.160
You look nervous, are you nervous?

15:04.160 --> 15:06.060
You don't need to be. Just tell me where he is.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.130
-Albert said not to tell to anyone.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.190
-Well, you don't think he meant me too, do you?

15:11.190 --> 15:13.120
I'm  Senor Vic's  wife.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.100
Now tell me where my husband is.

15:19.110 --> 15:22.010
-He's at Mariposa Hotel, room number six.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.080
-How do I get there?

15:24.010 --> 15:25.070
-Ramiro: I know the way.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.120
I'd be happy to escort you,  senora.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.090
-You can take my Vespino.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.040
-(grunting)

15:43.110 --> 15:44.140
-(engine sputters)

15:45.010 --> 15:47.040
-(engine revving)

15:56.010 --> 15:57.120
-Any word from Albert?

15:57.120 --> 15:58.190
-Charlie:  No, not yet.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.150
-Mate, he should have caught up by now.

16:00.150 --> 16:02.090
-We're gonna lose our chance, Charlie.

16:02.090 --> 16:05.080
-Just stick to the plan, okay? Albert will catch up.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.230
-Albert:  Where are you   taking me?

16:10.180 --> 16:12.170
-You'll find out soon enough.

16:14.050 --> 16:15.070
-(grunting)

16:15.070 --> 16:16.200
-Wake up, Mr. Hill.

16:17.190 --> 16:19.120
Time to leave sunny Spain.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.140
-Leave Spain and go where?

16:20.140 --> 16:21.140
-You're going home, Mr. Hill.

16:22.220 --> 16:24.050
-Home? -Oh.

16:24.230 --> 16:25.190
In all the excitement,

16:25.190 --> 16:27.110
I didn't properly introduce myself.

16:28.170 --> 16:29.160
Officer William Picket

16:29.160 --> 16:32.050
of the International Criminal Police Organization.

16:33.130 --> 16:34.200
-You're Interpol?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.220
-Proudly.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.030
And I've been assigned to bring you home

16:39.030 --> 16:42.040
and put you neatly back in prison for a very long time.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.050
-You're a long way from home, son.

16:45.050 --> 16:48.090
-Yet, I have very good friends here in San Toledo.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.050
-Don't you do it. Don't you dare--

16:52.050 --> 16:53.040
(muffled screams)

16:53.040 --> 16:54.170
-Shh. Shh. Shh.

16:58.130 --> 17:00.100
-(indistinct chatter)

17:14.110 --> 17:15.200
-Are you gonna hear me out?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.230
-I think I heard everything I needed to hear.

17:18.230 --> 17:21.000
-You gotta know no one meant for your dad to get hurt.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.050
-I guess there's a big difference

17:22.050 --> 17:24.040
between what you want and what you actually get, huh?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.050
-Look, you can hate me all you like.

17:27.030 --> 17:29.070
Snake Eyes means business.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.230
-I don't need you looking out for me, okay?

17:30.230 --> 17:31.220
Go away.

17:37.050 --> 17:38.140
-We're running out of time, Charlie.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.230
-Hate 'Em:  We go now, Charlie,   before we run out of road, mate.

17:40.230 --> 17:42.200
We need to hit him now.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.010
-The plan was to use four cars to box him in.

17:45.010 --> 17:46.130
We don't have four cars.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.030
Just stick to the plan.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.120
-(sighs)

17:50.150 --> 17:51.210
-Damn it, Albert, where are you?

18:06.030 --> 18:07.030
-(pounding on door)

18:07.030 --> 18:08.050
-Vic, it's Lily!

18:08.170 --> 18:09.150
-(continues pounding)

18:09.150 --> 18:10.160
-Open the door!

18:11.020 --> 18:12.180
-Stand aside,  Senora Hill.

18:12.180 --> 18:14.040
I will get us in.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.100
(grunts)

18:15.100 --> 18:16.080
(groans)

18:16.080 --> 18:17.070
Fuck!

18:17.070 --> 18:18.110
-Get out of the way, Ramiro.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.000
Vic?

18:26.220 --> 18:27.220
-Ugh.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.110
Good night liquid.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.040
Ugh.

18:32.140 --> 18:33.140
-(sniffs)

18:34.030 --> 18:35.060
Chloroform.

18:37.000 --> 18:37.210
Shit.

18:53.220 --> 18:55.120
-Tomas has exited the vehicle.

18:56.140 --> 18:58.140
He's walking inside with the diamonds.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.030
Await further instruction.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.180
-(tires screeching)

19:01.180 --> 19:03.070
-Looks like we missed our chance.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.060
-Shit.

19:10.010 --> 19:11.000
-(sighs)

19:13.030 --> 19:14.040
Come on. Move.

19:18.230 --> 19:19.220
Move.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
-Hate 'Em:  I told you we should   have hit him on the way in.

19:30.060 --> 19:31.130
-Think, Charlie, think.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.150
-Sit.

19:43.010 --> 19:45.060
-(Picket humming)

19:47.070 --> 19:50.010
-You got a singing voice not even a mother could like.

19:50.010 --> 19:53.000
-Oh, Mr. Hill, you've woken up in time to enjoy the drive.

19:55.020 --> 19:57.060
-Throwing the net around Victor Hill

19:57.060 --> 20:01.000
will put quite a pretty feather on your cap, Lil' Willy.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.020
-(chuckles)

20:02.020 --> 20:03.050
Oh, come now.

20:03.050 --> 20:05.220
You really think I was gonna come all the way here

20:05.220 --> 20:08.010
and leave without Mrs. Hill, too?

20:08.010 --> 20:10.020
-Leave her out of it.

20:10.020 --> 20:12.070
I'm more than enough to earn your accolades.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.150
-Are you gonna beg now?

20:14.120 --> 20:17.080
Because that would be so pedestrian.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.100
I first met Ortega years ago

20:19.100 --> 20:21.000
on a drug trafficking task force.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.170
And the day you fled London with all that money,

20:23.170 --> 20:25.000
he was my first call.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.080
I've been chasing your kind long enough to know

20:27.080 --> 20:29.000
that you see southern Spain

20:29.000 --> 20:32.070
as some sort of gangster retirement plan.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.230
So '80s, Victor.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.160
Should've gone to Panama. Hmm.

20:48.220 --> 20:50.020
-(sighs)

20:51.130 --> 20:52.200
Hello, Albert.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.090
-What is this? Why am I here?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.080
-It's over.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.110
You lost.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.050
-What are you talking about? Lost what?

21:09.060 --> 21:10.050
-All of it.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.130
-Okay.

21:17.020 --> 21:18.100
So you've been planning this ever since

21:18.100 --> 21:20.010
Blanco got his hands on my dad, haven't you?

21:20.090 --> 21:21.080
-(chuckles)

21:22.130 --> 21:23.230
Think bigger, Albert.

21:23.230 --> 21:26.080
I've been planning this since I got word

21:26.080 --> 21:30.040
the Hills left England on a boat with 10 million euros.

21:31.020 --> 21:34.120
And now that you served your purpose

21:34.120 --> 21:36.060
and I am poised to seize control

21:36.060 --> 21:38.050
of Garcia's hashish empire,

21:38.050 --> 21:40.230
your parents will have their heads mounted back

21:40.230 --> 21:43.010
at the Interpol HQ in England.

21:43.010 --> 21:47.070
And your friends will be buried without a funeral,

21:48.030 --> 21:50.040
but I've got other plans for you, Albert.

21:51.200 --> 21:55.040
You see, I'm cleaning house across the board today.

21:57.110 --> 21:59.230
Garcia, the Hill gang,

22:02.040 --> 22:07.090
and that lovely interloper out for revenge

22:07.090 --> 22:09.080
for her dear departed daddy.

22:09.210 --> 22:13.160
-You really think I'll let you get away with this? Yeah?

22:15.230 --> 22:17.070
You'll never catch us all.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.040
Never.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.110
-Interpol already has your father

22:22.220 --> 22:24.070
and I have you.

22:28.230 --> 22:29.220
-(cell phone chimes)

22:29.220 --> 22:32.010
-Now I know just where to find

22:32.010 --> 22:33.160
the rest of your friends.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.190
-(speaking Spanish)

22:39.030 --> 22:40.110
-It's a shame.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.190
You had talent.

22:42.090 --> 22:43.170
Goodbye, Albert.

22:53.110 --> 22:57.080
-Who do you think would want to take your husband,  Senora Hill?

22:58.140 --> 23:01.060
-The list isn't short, Ramiro.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.010
Vic has a way of...

23:05.090 --> 23:07.110
attracting unwanted attention.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.140
-(cell phone ringing)

23:19.150 --> 23:20.140
-Who is this?

23:20.140 --> 23:22.010
-Picket (over phone):  Never mind who I am.

23:22.010 --> 23:24.130
I imagine you're far more curious about your husband.

23:24.230 --> 23:26.040
Right, Lily?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.030
-Lily:  Where is he?

23:28.060 --> 23:30.160
-As luck would have it, I'm staring at him as we speak.

23:32.130 --> 23:33.150
-Is he okay?

23:33.150 --> 23:35.200
-For now, but I can't promise he'll stay that way,

23:36.190 --> 23:38.040
unless you're willing to join us.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.120
-(line beeps)

23:42.010 --> 23:43.200
-You have something to say about all this?

23:43.200 --> 23:45.120
-You leave my wife out of it.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.140
She's a civilian.

23:46.140 --> 23:48.220
-(scoffs) No, Lily stopped being a civilian

23:48.220 --> 23:50.030
the moment she met you.

23:50.230 --> 23:53.060
Her life was over the moment you touched her,

23:54.070 --> 23:55.100
same as the others.

23:56.220 --> 23:58.100
In the end, they're all gonna go down

23:58.100 --> 24:01.050
because of you, Mr. Hill.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.110
-To the address the nasty man gave us?

24:09.110 --> 24:10.090
-No, it's a trap.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.090
We're gonna make a stop first.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.130
-A stop? Where?

24:15.180 --> 24:16.200
-The marina.

24:19.030 --> 24:20.170
I need to see a man about a gun.

24:21.050 --> 24:23.010
-(exhales)  Adelante.

24:30.070 --> 24:31.110
-Still no word from Albert.

24:31.110 --> 24:32.190
-Well, we're gonna kick the doors down

24:32.190 --> 24:34.000
and take the diamonds without him.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.140
-No, no, no. We didn't plan to storm the stash house.

24:36.140 --> 24:38.120
We don't know what's behind that door, do we, Hate 'Em?

24:38.120 --> 24:40.070
-Hate 'Em: Well, let's go and find out.

24:40.070 --> 24:41.210
-Albert would know what to do.

24:41.210 --> 24:44.030
-Look, I don't know where Albert is, okay?

24:44.030 --> 24:45.060
Or what happened to him.

24:46.090 --> 24:48.210
But I do know there's a fortune in there

24:48.210 --> 24:50.050
waiting for us to take it.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.100
-Yeah, there is.

24:51.100 --> 24:52.090
-Now...

24:54.110 --> 24:55.170
I'm gonna go in there

24:56.120 --> 24:58.140
and I'm gonna walk back out with those diamonds.

25:01.030 --> 25:02.110
Now who's with me?

25:03.120 --> 25:04.150
-(chuckles) Yes.

25:04.230 --> 25:06.060
Let's go, Charlie boy.

25:06.060 --> 25:07.080
-Fuck it.

-A friend with a gun?

25:38.100 --> 25:39.070
-Hello, Lily.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.160
-Clarence.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.150
-I'm Ramiro Ramirez.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.180

25:43.100 --> 25:45.120
Clarence, I know we've really only just met,

25:45.120 --> 25:46.130
but, um...

25:47.170 --> 25:49.200
I spent most of my life around a certain kind of a man

25:49.200 --> 25:52.200
and after a while one gets to recognizing the type.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.120
-I suspect you do.

25:57.210 --> 25:59.160
-My real name is Lily Hill.

26:01.130 --> 26:03.060
My husband's name is Vic Hill

26:03.060 --> 26:06.050
and he is a fugitive here on the lam on the Costa del Sol.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.050
Somebody's kidnapped him and I need your help.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.080

26:26.010 --> 26:28.130
-Shit. They're there. They're there.

26:28.130 --> 26:30.110
Fuck, 'cause they know we was here.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.080
-We're trapped, Charlie.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.120
-Don't look at me, mate. I'm a number two.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.130
You're running this show now.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.220
-Oh, I am?

26:57.220 --> 26:58.220
-Yeah.

26:59.070 --> 27:01.080
-Oh, okay. Yeah.

27:01.150 --> 27:02.200
Yeah, I am.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.190
Right.

27:07.110 --> 27:09.100
We just need some reinforcements, all right?

27:13.230 --> 27:15.030
-Good thinking.

27:25.190 --> 27:27.030
-Shit.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.100
-Have you ever choked someone, Albert?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.150
It's very special.

27:46.150 --> 27:47.200
Very intimate.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.040
I'll be back for you.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.080
Don't go anywhere.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.090
It's gonna be a long day, Albert.

29:04.110 --> 29:07.130
-Listen, I'm not sitting on a toilet waiting to get whacked.

29:07.130 --> 29:08.150
I say we go out there

29:08.150 --> 29:10.090

30:49.150 --> 30:52.030
and you are under arrest for aiding and abetting

30:52.030 --> 30:53.160
one Victor Hill.

30:55.030 --> 30:57.020
I've been assigned to bring you and your husband

37:33.210 --> 37:36.000
I've been a complete fool, love.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.200
I thought I was being supportive

37:38.200 --> 37:42.040
but I've just been stubborn and-and selfish.

37:43.150 --> 37:45.110
I can't see a life without you.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.170
You're my life raft in the storm.

37:50.140 --> 37:51.180
Please don't leave me.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.100
-It's not just been about you, Vic. It's...

37:56.100 --> 37:57.210
Well, it has actually, mostly.

37:58.180 --> 38:01.030
But it's taken me this long to realize what I want.

38:01.030 --> 38:04.200
I thought that I wanted you to retire

38:04.200 --> 38:07.170
and live the quiet life with me, but it's the opposite.

38:07.170 --> 38:09.060
I don't wanna take Spanish classes

38:09.060 --> 38:11.010
and-and cooking lessons.

38:11.010 --> 38:12.190
I wanna rob banks with you.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.000
-(chuckles)

38:14.000 --> 38:16.140
-I do, Vic. I wanna rob banks with you.

-If I wasn't tied up right now, oh, ho!

38:19.170 --> 38:20.190

38:21.230 --> 38:23.180
-Hello, Vic.

38:33.210 --> 38:36.090

-I'll take over from here, Clarence.

-I'm sure you will, Vic.

-Lily: Thank you.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.030

39:34.200 --> 39:36.050
-Was it him? -No.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.010

39:39.130 --> 39:41.090
Listen, we need to lay low.

39:41.090 --> 39:42.230
Can we use your place out of town?

39:45.070 --> 39:46.100
-Yes, of course.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.140
Let's go. I've got the car in the garage.

39:51.050 --> 39:52.150

39:55.040 --> 39:57.150
-I'm not making demands. I'm telling you how it is.

39:59.210 --> 40:00.230
-What do you want to do?

40:35.230 --> 40:37.030
We need to blow town.

40:37.140 --> 40:38.170
-We'll get Hate 'Em and the kids

40:38.170 --> 40:40.180
and we'll leave this shithole in our rear view tonight.

40:41.030 --> 40:42.080

40:42.080 --> 40:43.170
I can't stay in San Toledo

40:43.170 --> 40:45.110

41:05.160 --> 41:06.170
-What's happened?

41:06.170 --> 41:08.060
-Listen, I haven't got time to explain.

41:08.060 --> 41:09.210

41:09.210 --> 41:11.070
