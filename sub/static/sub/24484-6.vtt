WEBVTT

01:29.924 --> 01:31.634
So, what is that?

01:36.847 --> 01:38.849
The Reggie chip.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.851
That's how he proposed to Mom.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.103
Or decided to.

01:43.145 --> 01:46.065
Yes, no.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.068
He flipped it three times
before he got a "yes."

01:53.030 --> 01:54.782
He gave it to her.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.618
She gave it to me.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.328
For good luck.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.709
He still doesn't know.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.629
Keep trying.
You'll get through.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.801
Why don't you wait?

02:13.843 --> 02:15.928
We can go to the bank together.

02:15.970 --> 02:19.139
I need to get her instructions.
The will.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.393
So we can do this
the way she wants.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.353
Okay.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.522
See how your day goes.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.774
You can always call me,
I can meet you there.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.401
I know.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.027
Thanks.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.533
-That's Jerry.
-Yeah.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.618
Okay if I stay in here?

02:39.660 --> 02:42.246
Of course. He'll understand.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.383
Jerry, come on in.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.553
Eleanor, it's Jay.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.805
My brother's in town.
Call when you get this.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.557
Yeah, I've heard this before.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.559
-There's two of 'em.
-One after the other.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.686
Same language.
The brother, twice?

03:05.728 --> 03:07.438
Federal code.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.440
Griffin pulling her
in to protect her.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.025
Tried. What else?

03:11.066 --> 03:13.235
An outgoing text.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.070
Screen grab from a video

03:15.112 --> 03:17.615
sent late Saturday night
to this number.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.033
Blocked subscriber.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.577
Griffin.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.245
I've got Max on it.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.331
15 minutes later,
Eleanor calls you.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.000
She was jazzed.
Back in the hunt.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.669
Hmm.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.964
Ran facial recognition.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.925
No hits local.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.927
Federal, a flag

03:37.968 --> 03:40.763
and a dead-end phone number
for further inquiries.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.974
Someone wants
to keep this guy a ghost.

03:44.016 --> 03:47.519
Ghost who killed her,
had her killed.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.772
Ghost makes Eleanor for a Fed,

03:49.813 --> 03:52.608
and/or thinks she makes him.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.443
She sends this.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.612
Griffin checks it out. Whoa.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.113
Major bad guy.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.490
Monday morning, calls her in.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.450
She took this.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.329
The video was taken

04:05.371 --> 04:07.748
20 minutes before
she texted the screen grab.

04:07.790 --> 04:11.293
At a restaurant called
"Golden Soup."

04:11.335 --> 04:14.046
San Gabriel.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.839
Leave now,
it's less than an hour.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.591
Want company?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.679
-Take your ride?
-Yeah.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.895
Hey.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.481
Reggie's Skype account--
it looks like it's been closed.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.237
We'll find him.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.447
I'm gonna take a ride
with Jerry.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.992
I left the car keys out
on the counter.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.453
I might not go.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.373
Whatever you decide.
I'll be on my cell.

04:49.415 --> 04:52.292
Me, too.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.421
I love you.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.884
Dad?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.508
- -

05:41.550 --> 05:43.177
- -

05:46.972 --> 05:48.974
- -

06:27.721 --> 06:29.723
Let's play spot-the-Fed.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.308
I already started.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.644
Cable truck as we drove in.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.479
Couple with the tiny dog.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.190
Maybe we should rethink
our approach.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.359
I want soup.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.657
Harry Bosch.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.660
Jerry Edgar, I presume?

06:49.701 --> 06:52.121
Chuck Tang.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.207
What are you doing here?

06:58.752 --> 07:01.171
You can't really be here.

07:07.052 --> 07:10.180
Look, Harry,
I can't begin to imagine.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.682
I'm not asking you to, Chuck.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.475
Don't jerk me off. Who is he?

07:13.517 --> 07:17.062
A person of interest in a major
counterintelligence operation.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.355
You're set up here,
waiting for him.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.149
Homeland Security, geopolitics.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.318
The stakes are sky-high, and
you are directly in our arena.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.029
Fine. We'll wait here with you.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.949
His daughter just lost her mom,
and you're talking about stakes.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.413
The man is a Chinese national.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.623
-He didn't pull the trigger.
-You saying he wasn't involved?

07:36.665 --> 07:38.292
I'm saying that
if you go anywhere

07:38.333 --> 07:40.377
near him,
you'll jeopardize the case

07:40.419 --> 07:42.838
that Eleanor gave her life for.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.256
You want to do that?

07:44.298 --> 07:46.133
No, I don't.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.012
Thank you.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.097
Let me know
if you need any help.

07:56.435 --> 07:59.646
New Bosch-- Helpful Harry.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.107
He's right. We don't want
to screw up their case.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.775
We leave
their person of interest alone?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.194
Homicide's our arena.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.613
We'll go
after the shooters first.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.285
As long as we're out of here
before this goddamn protest.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.412
-Here you are. -Oh,
hold-hold on a second, okay?

08:15.454 --> 08:17.623
-Oh. I'm sorry. Egg whites only.
-Oh, sure.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.249
- -Oh.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.376
What the fuck?!

08:21.418 --> 08:23.795
He stole my phone!

08:25.714 --> 08:27.841
This was

08:27.883 --> 08:30.844
-a rush order.
-Howard Elias. Hot case.

08:30.886 --> 08:33.096
Nah.
Lincoln dropped off last night.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.265
The test was authorized
for after-hours.

08:35.307 --> 08:38.018
Nothing to test.
Our courier banged in sick.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.561
We couldn't get your evidence
from property.

08:39.603 --> 08:41.396
It's still there?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.982
Well, it would be if I hadn't
caught it when I came in,

08:44.024 --> 08:47.277
and I sent someone over, but
we are way backed up here today.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.238
Yeah, well,
this one's a high priority.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.406
Straight from the chief.
Yeah, I get it.

08:51.448 --> 08:55.077
Do my best.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.330
Times called me this
morning about Francis Sheehan.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.667
Prime suspect.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.254
Your boy Bosch and his task
force are leaking like a sieve.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.006
The same Bosch
who ran interference

09:08.048 --> 09:10.592
for RHD's
Friday night antics?

09:10.634 --> 09:12.302
You're not here about Sheehan.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.221
Rumor is you're making changes.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.639
The tenth floor
has always complained

09:15.681 --> 09:17.516
about my unit's caseload.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.228
Some of my command staff think
you're not pulling your weight.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.896
Do you agree with them?

09:26.858 --> 09:29.194
Send in Detectives Bennett
and Pell.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.285
Chief.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.455
I understand you've had
a breakthrough on River Watch.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.040
Person of interest.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.750
Undocumented individual
overheard,

09:43.792 --> 09:45.502
two separate occasions,

09:45.544 --> 09:48.171
bragging about the torching
of an old folks' home.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.673
Reliable sources?

09:49.715 --> 09:51.675
CI's we've used before,
solid results.

09:51.717 --> 09:54.261
We have a description, a name.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.221
Uh, Bondigas.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.390
Says he lit the match,
made a pile of money.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.142
A contract job.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.601
Yeah, we've made
a few discreet inquiries.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.020
Didn't want to spook 'em.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.521
Construction site's downtown.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.064
CI says he's a welder.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.777
Bosch has some intersect
with this, doesn't he?

10:10.819 --> 10:12.988
A cold case connected
to Caffrey,

10:13.030 --> 10:14.698
the ex-cop who died in the fire.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.491
We reached out.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.493
Bosch must be pretty busy
with Elias.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.746
Well, I'll fill him in
the next time we talk.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.456
Good work.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.875
Thank you, sir.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.213
Listen, Chief, I...

10:30.255 --> 10:32.257
I wouldn't put too much faith
in rumors, Captain.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.010
If I decide to make changes
in RHD, trust me,

10:35.052 --> 10:38.638
you'll be the first to know.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.392
I don't know what
you're worried about, Allen.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.728
The thing's not built yet.
The penthouses are 70% sold.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.189
-It's not me. It's my board.
-Who?

10:47.230 --> 10:49.274
Jamie Leonard? His firm's
taking two full floors.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.569
We need to restructure the
new loan. You're too leveraged.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.279
This is legacy.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.074
We're all leveraged
one way or another.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.534
Leverage, risk--
that's how this city changes.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.460
The bank needs breathing room.
You need to shift some equity.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.879
Fine. Whatever you need.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.090
Two percent of your phase three
top sheet should do it.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.093
It's no problem.
Send the papers, I'll sign them.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.387
-Oh, shit.
-

11:18.428 --> 11:20.347
-Look at this.
-Oh, a good car wash

11:20.389 --> 11:22.307
will fix that right up.
It's just dust.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.061
Hell, have it detailed. On me.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.959
Golden Soup's ground zero.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.836
Poker game.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.757
who was playing,
how they got there.

11:55.799 --> 11:59.136
The Chinese national
didn't play. If he had,

11:59.177 --> 12:00.303
Eleanor would have taken his
picture earlier.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.140
So he showed up late.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.475
Why?

12:13.024 --> 12:15.819
We've got to talk.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.904
I thought we were.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.699
If I'm in, I'm in all the way,

12:20.740 --> 12:23.577
which means no surprises.
Not this time.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.706
No apology for what I did
with Gunn.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.667
I'm talking about now.
Moving forward.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.836
How does this go?

12:32.878 --> 12:34.254
We're gonna find
who killed Eleanor.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.840
That's not what I'm asking.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.383
But that's my answer.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.053
We get there,
see how it goes down.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.182
If that's not enough,
I understand.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.920
No justice, no
peace. No justice, no peace.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.421
No jus...

14:05.637 --> 14:07.514
Sorry. Left my keys in here.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.849
Central's got a witness
that puts Sheehan in a bar

14:09.891 --> 14:11.726
at Grand Street Friday night.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.353
Fit the timeline?

14:13.395 --> 14:16.273
Wit's wobbly on that.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.149
Uniform found your ID
in the parking lot this morning.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.360
Must've dropped it.

14:20.402 --> 14:24.364
-Mystery solved.
-

14:24.406 --> 14:27.200
No guarantees,

14:27.242 --> 14:28.702
but I'm gonna try to sneak you
in before this multi-four

14:28.743 --> 14:29.869
from South Bureau.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.038
Any chance I could watch?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.582
I've never seen one before.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.500
Bucket list.
Yeah, I get that a lot.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.711
I'll text you a heads-up
when we're close.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.859
Why can't you find Sheehan?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.654
I'm really uncomfortable
talking to you, sir.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.615
You really should be
talking to Bosch.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.575
I would be if
the good detective bothered

15:08.617 --> 15:10.118
to return my calls.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.708
-Sheehan. -A cop who doesn't
want to be found by other cops.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.127
He's making us work for it.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.338
I don't know what else
I can tell you.

15:21.379 --> 15:25.216
You know, if this murder
isn't solved,

15:25.258 --> 15:28.261
if this investigation
drags on...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.185
What about the ballistics?

15:35.226 --> 15:37.437
They tested his gun last night.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.189
Results should be back today.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.191
The bullets match, that's it.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.365
Thank you, Sergeant.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.307
Ms. Bosch. Lee Russo.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.934
I understand
you're having trouble

16:15.975 --> 16:17.268
with your mother's
safety deposit box.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.145
I need access to the box,

16:19.187 --> 16:20.897
but I don't need anyone
watching me while I do it.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.857
Unfortunately, probate rules...

16:22.899 --> 16:24.984
Only apply to boxes owned
by individuals.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.528
This box is owned by a trust.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.447
My mother transferred title
a few months ago.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.659
I'm sorry. I was misinformed.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.619
I have a key

16:34.661 --> 16:37.038
and a death certificate.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.249
And, as you can see,
I'm the successor trustee

16:39.290 --> 16:41.209
of the Eleanor Wish
family trust.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.171
Great. Everything's in order.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.075
-Hey, Mr. Sheehan.
-Hey.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.785
Cody.

18:38.827 --> 18:42.914
-Thanks for doing this.
-Yeah. No problem.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.124
Hey, you're undercover.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.211
Ah, I know.
You can't talk about it.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.505
-Just head out, please.
Thanks. -Yeah.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.182
Yeah, but how exactly

19:01.224 --> 19:03.268
does one coddle the egg?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.812
You indulge it. Big allowance,

19:05.854 --> 19:08.189
-trips to Paris for
Fashion Week. -I'm serious.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.941
But no COMSTAT meetings.

19:09.983 --> 19:13.027
Now, sure, an egg will help
a good L.T. egg.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.405
But those fucking windbag eggs

19:15.446 --> 19:16.990
from Valley Bureau... hmm-mm.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.533
Hollywood units

19:18.575 --> 19:20.410
and 27 Tom-Lincoln 41,

19:20.451 --> 19:21.703
ambulance hit and run
just occurred

19:21.744 --> 19:23.121
at Franklin and Cahuenga.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.415
Hit and run, that's close.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.791
L.T., come on. Back to the barn.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.377
Six-L-20. Show me responding
code three

19:29.419 --> 19:31.462
to hit and run
on Franklin and Cahuenga.

19:56.738 --> 19:59.657
-Lieutenant.
-Billets, Hollywood.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.952
Moore, Johnson.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.329
What do you got

20:04.370 --> 20:06.414
Uh, ID says Clifton Campbell.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.291
The driver of the Prius,

20:08.333 --> 20:11.085
Aubrey Stenstrom, was about
to park when Mr. Campbell

20:11.127 --> 20:12.837
crashed into her car,
and then was blindsided

20:12.879 --> 20:14.422
by a white SUV.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.924
Texting while driving.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.467
Park one of those black
and whites over here.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.177
Block the view of the decedent.

20:19.218 --> 20:23.181
Pedestrian witness got a vehicle
ID and a partial plate.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.266
The driver stopped,
then sped off.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.061
People hear that thud,
that sound,

20:28.102 --> 20:30.313
Morality.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.732
You on your
own with this, Rogow?

20:32.774 --> 20:34.567
Oh, yeah. I'm used to it.

20:34.609 --> 20:37.070
I'll be on this till EOW.
One and done.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.700
Believe I'll take me
a little stroll.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.119
We spent the morning babysitting
our lieutenant.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.246
COMSTAT.

20:47.288 --> 20:49.374
Got the broadcast on this on
our way back to the station.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.125
They have the crullers
over there?

20:51.167 --> 20:52.961
Bagels, but we had Eggslut
prior.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.712
Yeah. The line at that place
fucking sucks.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.798
Barrel.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.675
Check this out.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.601
Officer Rogow, you need
a little help with this?

21:08.643 --> 21:10.853
You guys think that gun
is some kind of clue,

21:10.895 --> 21:13.106
be my guest.
As far as I'm concerned,

21:13.147 --> 21:14.357
I'm looking at a felony K.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.753
Point has eyes on an arrival.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.757
Kid's back with an unidentified
male passenger.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.895
Been gone about
a quarter of an hour.

21:52.937 --> 21:54.313
Who's the friend?

22:45.656 --> 22:47.700
- -Bosch.

22:47.742 --> 22:50.328
It's Bullard, SIS.
At the Sheehan house?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.872
-Yeah. What's up? -Couple
minutes ago, a car pulled

22:52.914 --> 22:54.916
into a neighbor's
two doors down.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.919
Kid we've marked gets out with
an unidentified male passenger,

22:57.960 --> 22:59.837
goes inside.
Limited view.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.839
Hat, head down.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.633
Could've been Sheehan.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.052
SIS has movement on Sheehan.

23:06.094 --> 23:09.347
- -Bang it.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.982
Just now.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.693
Hey, we'll meet you there.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.780
Jimmy, I want

23:25.822 --> 23:29.492
SIS to lock it down
before we're on scene to assess.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.911
We've got a perimeter.

23:31.953 --> 23:34.622
I don't want
a barricaded suspect situation.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.582
Well, we don't want
to lose him again, either.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.918
-We won't.
-All right.

23:43.214 --> 23:45.550
Bullard?

23:45.591 --> 23:48.052
Robertson. We're on our way.
Listen, tighten up

23:48.094 --> 23:49.887
your secondary,
and have your layoff units look

23:49.929 --> 23:51.806
for a rental
he might have parked nearby.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.558
Roger that.

23:54.976 --> 23:57.395
What

24:24.505 --> 24:27.508
-Margaret.
-Frank, what do you want?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.927
Look, I just... I got to leave
for a little while, okay?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.512
And I just wanted
to come say good-bye.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.431
Done and done, Frank.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.726
I have to disappear myself.

24:36.767 --> 24:39.562
You disappeared two years ago.
Good plan, well thought out.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.939
I just want to say good-bye to
Liam. I want to give him a hug.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.067
Liam's at school--
kindergarten, five days a week.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.904
Oh, fuck.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.739
Oh, goddamn it.

24:49.780 --> 24:52.575
-Shit.
-How much have you had today?

24:52.617 --> 24:54.368
I'm not drinking.
I gave up. I quit.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.704
-I'm quitting.
-Oh, good to hear. Day one.

24:56.746 --> 24:58.414
I didn't expect you
to believe me.

24:58.456 --> 24:59.790
How can you expect me
to believe you, Frank?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.542
I don't even know you anymore.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.795
Maggie, I don't fucking know me,
either, anymore.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.839
Okay, you think
I'd be here right now

25:06.881 --> 25:09.133
in this place
if the baby had lived, really?

25:09.175 --> 25:11.761
Yeah, I do.
This is where you've been headed

25:11.802 --> 25:13.596
-for a real long time.
-Fuck.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.641
The baby,
the Michael Harris thing.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.559
You were looking for excuses
to get where you wanted,

25:18.601 --> 25:20.978
and now you're there.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.522
I'm sorry, Mags.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.865
- -Bosch.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.617
You got SIS moving in.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.494
-Take it easy, Frank.
-No. I get it.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.912
You put 'em there, right?

25:37.954 --> 25:39.914
You had to, it's the right move?

25:39.956 --> 25:42.833
-You didn't give us a choice.
-Yeah.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.710
Well, I'm giving you one now,
okay, 'cause my wife

25:44.752 --> 25:47.630
is here, Harry, okay My wife is here.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.423
I don't want her getting caught
in the fucking crossfire.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.050
Okay, let's talk this through.

25:51.092 --> 25:53.552
No, I'm not talking this
through, Harry. Okay?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.346
You talk... to them... now.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.556
They have to back off, okay?

25:57.598 --> 25:59.350
They have to back the fuck off.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.729
If they don't back off,
Harry, I'm...

26:03.771 --> 26:05.773
I'm gonna fucking eat my gun.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.316
No, you're not.

26:07.358 --> 26:08.901
I'm headed to you.

26:10.569 --> 26:14.031
Sheehan's cell-- it's back on.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.909
- -We're ten minutes away.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.912
Bosch, what's your location?

26:19.954 --> 26:22.540
Westbound, down on Victory
from the 5.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.583
Listen, Harry,
Margaret's got to go.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.294
She's got to pick up our kid
Liam.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.714
-Frankie, no. -Yes. Yes,
you have to go. She has to go.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.590
She's got to go get Liam, okay?
Once I know she's safe,

26:31.632 --> 26:33.301
that's fine.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.970
Then... then game over.
I'll come out, hands up.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.680
Frank,
put your wife on the phone.

26:37.722 --> 26:40.057
Hold on.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.434
Here.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.811
It's Harry.
Talk to him.

26:43.853 --> 26:46.480
Yeah.

26:46.522 --> 26:49.442
Margaret,
drive away from the house.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.068
And-and then what happens?

26:51.110 --> 26:52.528
Drive away from the house.

26:52.570 --> 26:53.821
When you see a patrol car,

26:53.863 --> 26:55.072
pull over.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.490
He's gonna hurt himself.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.576
-No, he's not.
-You don't know that.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.661
I won't let that happen.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.415
Okay.

27:06.876 --> 27:10.671
Sheehan's wife is driving away
from the house.

27:10.713 --> 27:15.176
Repeat. Sheehan's wife is going
to drive away from the house.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.012
One more time, sir.
Detective Robertson isn't here.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.348
Mm-hmm, but he would
tell you the same thing.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.684
You need to speak
to Media Relations.

27:25.186 --> 27:28.022
Confirm that, fuckhead.

27:28.064 --> 27:31.734
Firearms Unit call here

27:31.776 --> 27:33.569
Our rabbit's
at his wife's house.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.905
What was that?

27:35.946 --> 27:37.948
Our Times weasel-- Anderson.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.619
Wanted confirmation of Francis
Sheehan as our prime suspect.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.456
Can anybody keep a secret
in this town?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.048
Wife on the move.

27:56.759 --> 27:58.969
Heading south on primary.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.063
His phone--
it's moving with her.

28:09.105 --> 28:10.648
Copy that.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.280
Your close contain spooked him.

28:18.322 --> 28:21.909
-Man was already well spooked.
-You don't know that.

28:21.951 --> 28:23.911
Hey, let's argue about it later.
You close?

28:23.953 --> 28:26.872
Three minutes.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.694
She's pulled over.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.487
The phone--
it stopped with the car.

28:59.989 --> 29:02.700
Don't move!
Get out of the vehicle!

29:02.741 --> 29:04.702
-Slowly.
-

29:04.743 --> 29:06.120
Put your hands up.

29:06.162 --> 29:08.456
Up where I can see 'em.
Let's go!

29:08.497 --> 29:10.624
-Turn around.
-

29:10.666 --> 29:13.752
Walk backwards
to the sound of my voice.

29:13.794 --> 29:17.339
Keep coming.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.301
-Stop. I need you to kneel,
ma'am. -My son...

29:20.342 --> 29:22.678
Kneel!

29:22.720 --> 29:24.638
Put your hands behind
your back.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.973
Is your husband inside your car?

29:26.015 --> 29:27.933
Just don't hurt him. Please!

29:33.689 --> 29:36.942
He's not in the car.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.578
I have him.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.169
Grey Honda Element
heading westbound on "H."

29:55.211 --> 29:57.755
-We're close. Hang back.
-Copy that.

30:33.541 --> 30:36.168
Frank?

30:41.298 --> 30:42.633
Frank?

30:44.301 --> 30:46.220
There's another way.

30:46.262 --> 30:49.473
You didn't do Elias.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.850
Let me prove it.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.394
It's too late for that.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.979
No, no, no. No, it's not.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.689
No, it's not.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.900
We're all wasting our time
if that's how it is.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.361
Is that what you're saying?

31:04.196 --> 31:06.448
Liam.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.286
What about him?

31:10.327 --> 31:12.788
You check out now,
he'll never know.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.832
That may be better, Bosch.

31:14.873 --> 31:19.295
No. That's never better.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.213
You didn't do it.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.092
You got to show him, Frank.

31:25.134 --> 31:26.927
What about the other stuff?

31:26.969 --> 31:28.929
You're already taking
the first step.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.890
But this isn't worth
what it'll do to him.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.935
Villanova.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.312
The man you shot.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.230
It was a good shoot.
You know it.

31:38.272 --> 31:41.609
I do know it. I do.

31:41.650 --> 31:45.446
Your boy

31:45.487 --> 31:48.741
That's not just your birthday,
brother.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.952
That's every day for him.

31:51.994 --> 31:55.164
Every minute of every day
for the rest of his life.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.462
Come on, Frank.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.424
Come on.

32:15.476 --> 32:18.270
Um...

32:39.708 --> 32:41.960
Oh.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.526
This is fucked up, Harry.

33:05.567 --> 33:09.029
I know, brother.
Come on.

33:25.838 --> 33:29.675
Vintage Bosch.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.719
The way you talked him down.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.847
"I believe you, Frankie.
I believe."

33:34.888 --> 33:36.598
I meant it.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.517
Hey, man,
you already won your Oscar.

33:38.559 --> 33:41.186
-Jimmy.
-Hey, I'm just saying good job.

33:41.228 --> 33:44.898
Thank God we didn't have
to shoot another cop.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.486
Here comes the cavalry.

33:58.245 --> 34:01.373
This is on you, Bosch.
This whole thing.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.542
Mr. Special Task Force.

34:03.584 --> 34:07.379
Big man. Second you see Elias
dead, you think it's one of us.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.381
-It's what you guys thought,
too. -Well, Elias was coming

34:09.423 --> 34:10.758
after Frankie.
You know that, right?

34:10.799 --> 34:12.551
Most cops would protect
their own.

34:12.593 --> 34:13.844
I got two murders.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.387
I'm trying to find the truth.

34:15.429 --> 34:17.848
-The truth? What are...
-Whoa, whoa.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.279
We got her statement.

34:32.321 --> 34:33.697
Where's he going?

34:33.739 --> 34:34.990
Someplace safe.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.617
For how long?

34:36.658 --> 34:38.744
Are you gonna charge him
for killing Elias?

34:38.786 --> 34:41.121
Ballistics aren't back yet,
but he didn't do it.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.165
Don't worry. I'll clear him.

34:57.054 --> 35:00.808
Frank... get yourself
a good lawyer

35:00.849 --> 35:04.061
to deal with Black Guardian,
like we talked about.

35:04.102 --> 35:09.191
Meantime, I got 48 hours
to prove you didn't do it.

35:09.233 --> 35:12.778
I liked being a cop, Harry.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.699
Go easy, brother.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.288
You guys take him.

35:23.330 --> 35:24.540
We'll clean up here.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.166
Sure.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.986
Hi, you've reached
Tiffany's cell phone.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.113
Leave a message.

37:28.288 --> 37:30.290
It's a sweet ring.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.502
Yeah.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.802
What is this?

37:43.220 --> 37:45.222
Jesus.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.102
Night before I shipped out
from Fort Irwin.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.937
You were...

37:51.979 --> 37:54.815
what, four?

37:56.817 --> 38:00.237
Last nights, always tough.

38:02.030 --> 38:05.367
Borrego Springs Valley Inn.

38:06.368 --> 38:07.953
For some reason,

38:07.995 --> 38:10.956
your mom had this idea
we should go to the movies.

38:10.998 --> 38:12.416
Drive-in.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.209
That's a real thing?

38:14.251 --> 38:15.919
Yeah, used to be.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.797
2003, not so much.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.094
She swore she'd seen one
just outside of town.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.888
So the three of us hopped
in the Goat,

38:26.930 --> 38:29.141
-just after sunset...
-Slow down. "The Goat"?

38:29.182 --> 38:31.309
A perfect black GTO.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.353
I'm guessing that's a car.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.272
No, not a car.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.523
A beast.

38:36.565 --> 38:38.859
'67 Pontiac.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.610
And you named it.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.696
Ragtop, V8,

38:42.738 --> 38:44.865
four on the floor.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.576
Mads, a car like that
needs a name.

38:47.617 --> 38:51.079
I got a picture of it
around here, somewhere.

38:52.122 --> 38:55.584
Anyway...

38:55.625 --> 38:56.877
picnic basket in the back.

38:56.918 --> 39:00.130
You're on Mom's lap, buckled in.

39:00.172 --> 39:02.382
Top down, wind in our hair.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.801
Head to the drive-in.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.220
We get there,

39:07.262 --> 39:09.264
no movie.

39:09.306 --> 39:10.307
Closed?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.558
Never existed.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.061
She straight-up lied.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.272
It was a smart move.

39:17.314 --> 39:18.523
A picnic.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.942
My last night.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.070
But it was beautiful.

39:23.111 --> 39:25.113
Amazing view.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.531
It was a clear night.

39:26.573 --> 39:30.035
Sky was packed with stars,
and...

39:30.077 --> 39:31.912
it was just the three of us,

39:31.953 --> 39:36.291
sitting
on this big blue blanket.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.004
Buddy of mine
from Stars and Stripes

39:41.046 --> 39:44.424
made this up for me, and...

39:44.466 --> 39:46.426
I sent it to your mom
a few years later.

39:49.262 --> 39:52.682
The last time together
as a family.

39:59.689 --> 40:03.276
I asked her if she was okay,
me leaving.

40:03.318 --> 40:06.154
My age, an old guy,

40:06.196 --> 40:08.698
could've finished my service
as a training officer.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.743
But...

40:11.785 --> 40:14.996
she said she was fine with it.

40:15.038 --> 40:19.000
Said if I didn't believe her,
maybe I'd believe the stars.

40:19.042 --> 40:21.336
Your mom was a bit of a gambler.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.262
So, we're sitting there.

40:31.263 --> 40:33.390
No shooting stars.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.143
She said
she's gonna count to ten.

40:36.184 --> 40:39.896
One shows up,
I go to Afghanistan.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.983
No shooting star, I stay home.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.860
You saw one.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.070
Not just one.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.281
Ten,

40:49.322 --> 40:51.741
maybe 20.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.417
You know, Mads,

41:00.458 --> 41:03.753
if I had it to do over,

41:03.795 --> 41:06.256
I wouldn't have gone.

41:08.842 --> 41:10.760
You make choices.

41:10.802 --> 41:14.431
Sometimes they're wrong,
sometimes they're right.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.810
You do your best.

41:24.191 --> 41:27.903
I sure loved your mom.

41:46.087 --> 41:47.839
Going to bed.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.883
Yeah.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.409
Bosch.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.536
I'm not asking for a...

42:18.578 --> 42:19.829
"Jimmy, you're right."

42:19.871 --> 42:21.831
I'd settle for, um,

42:21.873 --> 42:23.917
"Jimmy, you're not wrong."

42:23.959 --> 42:25.210
No games.

42:25.252 --> 42:26.711
Not now.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.798
Ballistics came back.

42:29.839 --> 42:35.095
Bullet in Howard Elias matched
to Sheehan's service weapon.

42:35.136 --> 42:37.180
The nine he gave you.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.602
- -I know a good shortcut.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.854
-What?
-Never mind.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.899
Buckle up.

42:47.941 --> 42:50.360
Sheehan killed Elias.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.738
We solved it, Bosch.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.240
We got our guy.
