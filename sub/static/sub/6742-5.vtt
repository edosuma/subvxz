- About the prince

in the fucking leg.

didn't do anything--

- Shall I make some tea?

a job or something.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.490
No.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.168
Yeah.

I came by?

has got a plan for all of us.

it's okay.

from your sister?

Uh--

13:43.556 --> 13:44.925
Not for a few days.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.726
Father: I keep telling her
don't worry.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.528
I'd say "Don't worry.
She's a free spirit.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.497
She'll be in touch
when she's ready," right?

13:50.563 --> 13:51.899
Right. I--

13:51.899 --> 13:54.001
I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

How did this happen?

15:31.198 --> 15:34.167
Uh, I-- I don't
remember exactly.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.636
Look, if you could just
stop it bleeding.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.171
I can't be late for work.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.273
It's one day, Frank.
Can't you just stay home?

15:40.340 --> 15:43.076
I have to make up
the time I missed.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.113
If I'd known
the damage I'd cause

15:46.179 --> 15:48.315
by getting
on that damn bus--

15:48.381 --> 15:50.483
You had to do
something for Trudy.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.918
Yeah.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.586
I should have talked to you.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.921
You'd have gone anyway.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.090
Not if I'd known
what they'd do to you.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.293
And John and Emily.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.567
Will there be a funeral?

16:17.877 --> 16:20.047
They were incinerated.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.750
There's nothing left.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.521
Bill must be--

16:30.890 --> 16:32.559
[sigh]

16:32.625 --> 16:34.261
He's, uh,

16:34.327 --> 16:38.398
he's holding a kind
of memorial service later,

16:38.465 --> 16:40.233
but I-- I--

16:40.300 --> 16:42.069
I shouldn't be there.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.505
Hold still.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.680
Can I ask you something?

16:57.084 --> 16:59.086
Why did they let you go?

17:00.853 --> 17:04.424
They, uh, they caught
some woman smuggling films.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.459
They thought
she had Trudy's.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.134
Thanks.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.577
So what now?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.146
I'm going to work.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.614
You can, uh...

17:28.848 --> 17:31.118
You can go to the dojo,
I guess.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.324
Well, does that mean
we just--

17:38.525 --> 17:40.260
go back to the way
things were?

17:40.327 --> 17:41.828
We can't ever go back.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.296
I'm talking
about surviving,

17:43.363 --> 17:44.764
getting through today,
Juliana.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.733
I'm not looking
beyond that right now.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.156
[knocking]

18:12.992 --> 18:17.697
Mr. Tagomi, you've met
my faithful bodyguard.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.970
They know, don't they?

18:24.036 --> 18:25.172
About what?

18:25.172 --> 18:26.573
That I'm not Baynes.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.641
They took my passport
at the Embassy,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.777
and they haven't let me
out of their sight since.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.779
Where's the microfilm now?

18:32.845 --> 18:35.582
I don't have it,
not at hand.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.917
I...swallowed it.

18:37.984 --> 18:41.888
And it's proving
difficult to relax.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.325
At least it's safe.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.760
The safety helps no one.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.964
I cannot leave here without
completing my mission.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.900
We no longer have a choice.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.404
You said that your oracle
favored a connection.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.340
Have you lost faith in that?

19:00.407 --> 19:02.442
If you are arrested,

19:02.509 --> 19:05.212
how long before
the Nazis kill you?

19:05.278 --> 19:06.613
Our mission now

19:06.679 --> 19:08.948
is to get you out
of the Pacific States alive.

19:09.015 --> 19:12.285
Give me one more chance
with the Science Minister.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.387
The only chance we have

19:14.454 --> 19:18.591
is a single shuttle from
here to New York tonight.

19:18.658 --> 19:22.295
I will retrieve
your Swedish passport.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.236
Tagomi-san.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.338
Risking your life

19:31.404 --> 19:33.840
to prevent a world war
is one thing.

19:33.906 --> 19:38.245
Risking it to save mine
was never part of the deal.

19:38.278 --> 19:43.683
I will not wash another
good man's blood

19:43.750 --> 19:45.718
from my hands today.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.562
Ed:
Did she tell you
what happened out there?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.665
We didn't really
talk about it.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.205
Did you tell her
about the gun?

20:06.273 --> 20:08.475
What did I say
to you this morning?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.710
Yeah, but I didn't
think you meant Jules.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.479
What, you didn't think
she was covered

20:12.545 --> 20:14.314
by "You can't tell
anybody"?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.854
None of this is my fault,
Frank.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.223
Whether I fired
that thing or not,

20:24.291 --> 20:25.958
they could still
be looking for me,

20:26.025 --> 20:27.594
so keep your mouth shut.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.103
[clicking]

20:37.169 --> 20:39.606
This is good work, Frank.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.909
Thank you,
Mr. Wyndam-Matson.

20:42.975 --> 20:46.413
You still designing
that jewelry of yours?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.615
No, sir.
I'm done with that.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.451
Everything else okay?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.990
Yeah. Yeah, everything's
back to normal.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.796
All of these drains must
be checked individually,

21:03.863 --> 21:06.699
every one within a 5-kilometer
radius of the Embassy.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.534
Yes, Inspector.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.801
And the alleyways, all--

21:19.011 --> 21:20.347
[grunt]

21:27.820 --> 21:30.957
If the gunman
is not apprehended,
Sergeant Yoshida,

21:31.023 --> 21:33.393
you will act as Kaishakunin

21:33.460 --> 21:35.962
when I commit Seppuku.

21:47.940 --> 21:48.941
[Japanese command]

21:59.386 --> 22:01.120
[speaking Japanese]

22:01.187 --> 22:04.991
Miss Crain, have you
reported to the Kempeitai?

22:06.659 --> 22:07.760
Why?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.397
The dojo is
a place of harmony.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.899
Nothing can be allowed
to interfere with that.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.403
They came here?

22:18.237 --> 22:22.074
I'm afraid that,
as a wanted person,

22:22.141 --> 22:23.510
there can be no question

22:23.576 --> 22:25.044
of you continuing
to practice with us.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.706
[speaking Japanese]

22:53.773 --> 22:54.807
Um...

22:54.874 --> 22:56.509
you've been looking
for me.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.445
My name is Juliana Crain.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.680
Could you tell someone
I'm here, please?

23:13.726 --> 23:17.864
Mr. Blake,
I am Major Klemm.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.766
Heil Hitler.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.569
Heil Hitler.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.170
Apologies
for keeping you waiting.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.473
I hope it wasn't
too uncomfortable.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.010
Not as uncomfortable
as the ride here.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.514
It's not like I expected
a parade or anything.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.949
Those guys
were pretty rough.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.552
If you were being watched
by insurgents

23:39.619 --> 23:40.853
at the truck drop-off,

23:40.920 --> 23:43.189
your cover
will remain intact.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.528
We haven't heard from you

23:48.595 --> 23:51.964
since you set off to meet
the Man In the High Castle.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.867
No.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.538
Well, we have several gaps
we need to fill.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.711
Yoshida:
Where were you, Miss Crain?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.979
I went to look
for my sister.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.517
She disappeared.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.687
- Her name is Trudy.
- We know her name.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.591
Where did you go?

24:20.226 --> 24:22.128
The places Trudy loved.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.165
Twin Peaks first.

24:26.232 --> 24:27.700
When there was
no sign of her,

24:27.767 --> 24:29.536
I took a bus to Yosemite.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.170
You camped there?

24:33.439 --> 24:36.142
You told Mr. Frink
you were camping.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.945
You were listening.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.280
Klemm:
I don't understand, Mr. Blake.

24:41.347 --> 24:45.117
These insurgents
on the mountain,

24:45.184 --> 24:47.019
what did they want from you?

24:47.086 --> 24:48.420
The film.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.456
But ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Smith
ordered you

24:50.557 --> 24:51.958
not to take the film with you.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.225
Yes.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.763
But I thought
I had a real shot

24:56.829 --> 24:59.098
at finding the Man
In the High Castle.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.167
As it turns out,

25:01.233 --> 25:02.702
the film was the only thing

25:02.769 --> 25:04.571
that convinced him
I wasn't a spy.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.575
Do you know Randall Baker,
Miss Crain?

25:09.642 --> 25:13.846
Did your sister
ever mention that man?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.849
Klemm:
So you lost the film.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.451
I wouldn't say I lost it.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.120
Then you still have it.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.291
No.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.359
So you lost it.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.761
[door opens]

25:33.299 --> 25:35.234
What did you lose, Joe?

25:36.869 --> 25:40.072
The film I was carrying,
sir, was taken from me

25:40.139 --> 25:41.641
by Lemuel Washington,

25:41.708 --> 25:44.777
leader in the Resistance
in Canon City.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.651
Carry on, Major.

25:56.288 --> 25:57.990
Don't mind me, Joe.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.864
No.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.233
No, I don't recognize him.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.474
Please continue.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.444
Smith: Are any pages
missing, Major?

26:18.510 --> 26:21.147
Klemm:
No, ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer,
I don't believe so.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.885
I don't see any mention
of the girl.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.225
The girl?

26:33.292 --> 26:36.996
You don't mean the girl
who died in the car.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.998
That's the only girl
I can think of.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.668
The one the Marshal
was after?

26:42.702 --> 26:45.271
Joe:
Honestly, she was no one.

26:46.673 --> 26:47.874
Smith: No one?

26:49.541 --> 26:52.411
This Marshal, Mr. Kahler,

26:52.478 --> 26:54.747
what did he say
in his report?

26:54.814 --> 26:57.083
Klemm: That Mr. Blake
defended the girl,

26:57.149 --> 27:02.488
told him to leave her alone
because he was using her.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.925
That's correct. I thought
she was the courier

27:05.992 --> 27:07.293
you had told me about, sir.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.096
And did Major Klemm tell you
how important it is

27:10.162 --> 27:13.099
not to leave anything
out of this account, Joe?

27:14.533 --> 27:16.302
Yes, sir, he did.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.438
Look, this whole thing
has been a misunderstanding.

27:19.505 --> 27:20.773
Yoshida:
Look at the picture.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.709
I just want things
to go back to normal.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.989
I've never seen him.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.132
Juliana:
I came here voluntarily.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.501
If I'd known you were
looking for me,

27:49.568 --> 27:52.571
I would have come back
sooner to clear things up.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.274
But some things
can't be cleared up,

27:55.341 --> 27:57.576
can they?

27:57.643 --> 28:00.446
Like Mr. Frink's sister...

28:01.914 --> 28:04.550
his niece and nephew.

28:04.616 --> 28:07.319
We are all subject
to rules, Miss Crain,

28:07.386 --> 28:12.624
and if we fail to live by them,
the consequences are severe.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.460
You knew that.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.066
Is there anything

28:20.132 --> 28:22.835
you would like to add
to your transcript, Joe?

28:24.003 --> 28:25.838
I don't think so, sir.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.307
I'm sorry.
Is that a yes or a no?

28:30.777 --> 28:33.980
No, ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.052
You can leave for now.

28:42.254 --> 28:45.024
But things will never
return to normal for you.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.131
They cannot.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.325
[sniffle]

30:35.534 --> 30:36.502
[clatter]

30:39.605 --> 30:40.706
It's okay.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.574
Who are you?

30:42.641 --> 30:44.510
A friend of Randall's.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.548
I'm pretty sure
Randall's not here.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.884
Randall's dead.
I need to know

30:51.951 --> 30:54.020
if you delivered
the film he gave you.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.323
Did you know Trudy?

30:57.389 --> 30:59.291
Enough to know
how badly she wanted

30:59.358 --> 31:01.127
to get that film
to Canon City.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.995
How do I know
this isn't a trap?

31:03.062 --> 31:05.564
You won't until it's too late.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.939
The film got to where
it was supposed to go.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.509
Thank you.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.454
My turn.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.959
The Man In the High Castle--

31:32.959 --> 31:34.360
why is he collecting them?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.128
All we know
is we get them to him

31:36.195 --> 31:37.696
and he passes back
intelligence

31:37.763 --> 31:39.631
that we can use
against the Pons.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.101
How's that possible?

31:42.168 --> 31:45.137
If you came here looking
for answers about the films,

31:45.204 --> 31:47.306
you'll be disappointed.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.345
I came here
because Trudy was here.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.715
You've lost a lot
all at once.

31:56.782 --> 31:59.351
I know how that goes.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.022
Once you've decided
to go on,

32:03.089 --> 32:05.424
you've got to find a how.

32:05.491 --> 32:08.995
For me, the only way
was to fight.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.402
It has to be
about something more.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.687
Sir, I know it doesn't seem
like a complete success.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.491
But my mission
wasn't to retrieve a film

32:39.558 --> 32:42.361
or kill the Man
In the High Castle, sir.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.431
My mission was to identify
and gather intelligence

32:45.497 --> 32:47.433
on key figures
in the Resistance.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.868
Then I found Lemuel Washington.
I did that.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.370
I kept my cover intact.

32:53.505 --> 32:57.076
Lemuel Washington
disappeared yesterday,

32:57.143 --> 32:59.645
along with his
entire family.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.648
We don't know
where he is.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.651
Oh, you failed, Joe.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.654
You failed.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.225
Do you know why you failed?

33:14.726 --> 33:19.965
You are one component
in a complex machine

33:20.066 --> 33:21.567
that only works
if every part

33:21.633 --> 33:22.901
does exactly what it's
supposed to do

33:22.968 --> 33:24.970
in sync with the whole.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.738
Now, if you decide,

33:26.805 --> 33:29.675
without knowing
what the other
components are doing,

33:29.741 --> 33:32.711
to simply go your own way,

33:32.778 --> 33:37.683
eventually that machine
is going to break down.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.124
Don't ever disobey a direct
order from me again, Joe.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.764
I'm sorry, ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.400
Okay.

34:01.307 --> 34:04.743
Where are you spending
VA Day tomorrow, Joe?

34:08.280 --> 34:10.216
The files you requested,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.418
Thank you. I'll take
these home with me.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.653
Bring the car around, Major.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.654
Mm-hmm.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.626
Well?

34:22.794 --> 34:26.031
Um, I don't know.
I don't have any plans. Sir.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.500
Well,
then you'll be my guest.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.738
- Sir--
- Joe.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.643
I'm inviting you to my house
for the celebration.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.546
I know you haven't
spent a lot of time
among your own recently,

34:40.612 --> 34:45.651
and, uh, tomorrow's
about community.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.319
It's about family.

34:47.386 --> 34:50.856
Thank you, sir.
I'd like that very much.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.160
See you there.

34:54.160 --> 34:57.463
11 o'clock sharp.
Don't be late.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.656
- Frank.
- Hey.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.665
Mr. Crothers?
Hi. Ed McCarthy.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.301
We've met
a couple of times.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.203
I'm an old buddy
of Frank's.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.805
I'm real sorry, sir.
Real sorry.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.541
Yeah. Me, too.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.215
These are all friends
of yours and Laura's?

35:49.281 --> 35:53.018
And bosses and people
I work with.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.720
Laura met a few of them.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.656
I have to go on working here,

35:57.723 --> 36:00.226
and these
are honorable people.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.461
Do you know
how it would look

36:02.528 --> 36:04.129
to have no ceremony at all
for my family?

36:04.230 --> 36:06.232
Well, you don't
have to justify--

36:06.232 --> 36:07.566
You're damn right
I don't.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.110
If there are
no answers here,

36:19.245 --> 36:20.646
then where do I look?

36:20.712 --> 36:21.780
[chuckle]

36:21.847 --> 36:23.415
I'm serious.

36:23.482 --> 36:24.516
Do you have any idea

36:24.583 --> 36:25.684
how many different
fucking ways

36:25.751 --> 36:26.985
I nearly died
trying to get that film

36:27.052 --> 36:28.854
to where it was
supposed to go?

36:28.920 --> 36:30.889
Okay.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.291
We've got one thing.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.696
We think someone set up
Randall and Trudy.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.531
It's the only way
the Pons could have known

36:39.598 --> 36:41.600
where that film would be.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.604
The day they took Randall,

36:45.671 --> 36:47.406
he mailed this
to the box we use.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.450
Name mean anything to you?

37:01.287 --> 37:03.689
They had a contact
at the Nippon Building.

37:03.755 --> 37:06.558
But if whoever this is
is leaking information
about our activity,

37:06.625 --> 37:07.826
we need to know about it.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.728
Do you think it could be
a link to the films?

37:09.795 --> 37:10.929
We don't know.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.866
What we do know

37:14.933 --> 37:17.336
is there's a job
in there.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.740
At the Nippon?

37:21.807 --> 37:23.709
They only ever
want young women.

37:23.775 --> 37:26.312
Anybody over 27
should be married.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.082
I wouldn't ask you
to do it.

37:31.149 --> 37:34.320
I wouldn't ask anybody.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.154
Before you go into
a government building

37:36.221 --> 37:38.724
looking for someone who
might have got at least
two people killed,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.492
you'd better be sure
a certain kind of life

37:40.559 --> 37:42.394
is no better
than death for you.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.163
Because that's a choice

37:45.230 --> 37:47.333
you might not
get to make again.

37:47.399 --> 37:51.470
Man:
Death is very much
part of a life...

37:52.771 --> 37:57.743
a natural part of life's
cycle for all things

37:57.809 --> 38:01.947
and not something to be feared

38:02.013 --> 38:04.350
or spoken in hushed tone.

38:06.452 --> 38:11.222
Therefore,
we must not weep today

38:11.357 --> 38:12.824
for the loss of...

38:16.261 --> 38:21.533
John and Emilia and Lorna

38:21.600 --> 38:24.736
because the spirit is eternal.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.405
Emily and Laura.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.063
Hi, Frank.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.434
Do I know you?

38:55.501 --> 38:58.437
You maybe wouldn't remember.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.472
Mark Sampson.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.508
Laura worked for me
for a little while

39:02.574 --> 39:04.443
in the hardware store
on Mission.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.311
You came by
a couple of times.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.946
Oh. Yeah.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.716
You're the artist, right?

39:10.782 --> 39:13.919
I-- You know,
I used to be, I guess.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.922
But not anymore.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.492
I just want to say that...

39:21.593 --> 39:24.530
well, what can be said?
I'm sorry.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.432
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.066
If you're ever
in the neighborhood

39:28.133 --> 39:31.102
and you feel like talking,
just drop by. Okay?

39:32.638 --> 39:35.607
Number 42, right across
from the store.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.515
To life, Frank.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.095
[speaking Japanese]

39:57.162 --> 39:59.598
Ah. Inspector,
please.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.467
No, thank you,
Trade Minister.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.369
I will not stay long.

40:04.436 --> 40:06.505
I appreciate you coming
at such a busy time.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.874
What could we not discuss
on the telephone?

40:08.940 --> 40:12.444
I felt it correct
to speak in person.

40:12.511 --> 40:15.346
Guests of the Ministry
have asked

40:15.413 --> 40:17.415
when their passports
would be returned.

40:17.483 --> 40:20.318
I assured them
I would inquire.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.888
As soon as their
identities are verified

40:22.954 --> 40:25.924
and their reasons for being
in the Pacific States,

40:25.991 --> 40:28.827
all of their documents
will be returned.

40:30.629 --> 40:34.232
How long do you estimate
it will take?

40:34.299 --> 40:37.302
I offer no estimate.

40:37.368 --> 40:41.540
You met with a foreign visitor
at his hotel this morning.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.909
I met with several guests.

40:43.975 --> 40:47.713
They're honorable businessmen,
not assassins.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.180
Their time is valuable.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.550
All of our time is valuable.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.284
I understand
what is at stake.

40:53.351 --> 40:54.553
Do you?

40:55.621 --> 40:57.523
I was with the Royal Couple.

40:57.589 --> 41:01.727
So yes, I believe I do.

41:03.695 --> 41:06.532
Then no doubt
you will understand

41:06.565 --> 41:09.868
why I must disappoint you,
Trade Minister.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.538
I am sorry,

41:12.571 --> 41:16.708
but in this instance
there will be no exceptions.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.884
[toilet flushes]

41:25.951 --> 41:26.985
[whistling]

41:31.089 --> 41:32.658
[ring]

41:35.093 --> 41:36.161
[ring]

41:38.229 --> 41:39.565
Baynes.

41:39.631 --> 41:40.866
Your guard will change
in eight minutes.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.268
You have two minutes
to get out of your room.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.704
Take elevator 3
to the lobby.

41:53.444 --> 41:54.580
[ding]

41:57.649 --> 41:59.484
Take this. Keep walking.

41:59.585 --> 42:00.852
Not too quickly.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.488
Your taxi to the airport
is waiting.

42:03.589 --> 42:05.290
That is a diplomatic ticket

42:05.356 --> 42:08.426
and enables you to board any
flight in the Pacific States

42:08.493 --> 42:11.329
without identification.

42:11.396 --> 42:14.733
There will be
repercussions for you.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.202
I will deal with them.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.209
That's him,
the Science Minister.

42:26.845 --> 42:30.048
And the man with him
is named Muller.

42:30.115 --> 42:32.150
He knows me.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.962
You cannot.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.521
Oh. I'm sorry.

43:10.656 --> 43:11.723
Excuse me.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.261
Excuse me.

43:16.327 --> 43:18.196
Excuse me, sir.

43:25.737 --> 43:29.975
My apologies,
but I know you, don't I?

43:31.677 --> 43:34.079
I don't believe so,

43:34.145 --> 43:37.348
unless you're familiar
with Stockholm.

44:26.732 --> 44:28.333
Identity card.

44:39.745 --> 44:40.946
I'm told that someone
in personnel

44:41.012 --> 44:43.314
would see me about a job.

45:10.608 --> 45:12.410
You here about a job, too?

45:30.829 --> 45:32.964
My name is Juliana Crain.

45:38.403 --> 45:42.307
I don't know if you have
any positions available
at the moment, Mr. Eto.

45:44.475 --> 45:48.113
But I'd like to be considered
for anything suitable.

45:50.481 --> 45:52.383
I type pretty well.

45:52.450 --> 45:54.853
I speak some Japanese.

45:56.687 --> 45:58.456
I'm a fast learner.

46:01.559 --> 46:02.828
Stand.

46:09.835 --> 46:12.037
Remove your coat.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.526
There may be a role
you are suited to,

46:35.593 --> 46:37.695
subject to references,

46:37.762 --> 46:39.865
here in personnel.

46:41.532 --> 46:43.634
Alongside your other work,

46:43.701 --> 46:49.474
it would involve undertaking
certain personal services

46:49.540 --> 46:52.443
as and when I require them.

46:54.679 --> 46:58.016
What kind of services?

46:58.083 --> 46:59.885
You wish to work here?

46:59.918 --> 47:01.386
Yes, sir.

47:04.055 --> 47:08.026
It is an honor
for a girl like you

47:08.093 --> 47:10.195
to be employed here.

47:11.897 --> 47:13.231
I know that, sir.

47:13.298 --> 47:17.302
It is not for you
to question your duties.

47:17.368 --> 47:19.905
You simply do.

47:23.374 --> 47:25.576
[unzipping]

47:32.117 --> 47:35.620
Do you want the job or not?

47:37.588 --> 47:39.024
Oof.
