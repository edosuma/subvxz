00:01.204 --> 00:03.274
Jay and I are partners
in a parking lot.

00:03.366 --> 00:06.812
It's added a wonderful, new
dynamic to our relationship.

00:06.906 --> 00:09.233
The first step was hiring
someone to man the booth.

00:09.358 --> 00:12.718
We narrowed it down to the
two candidates who applied.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.140
I don't think it should be,

00:14.218 --> 00:15.702
"I hope there's a place to park

00:15.749 --> 00:17.398
"near where I love to have lunch."

00:17.451 --> 00:18.467
I think it should be,

00:18.507 --> 00:20.960
"I hope there's a place to have lunch

00:21.020 --> 00:23.366
"near where I love to park."

00:23.593 --> 00:24.857
Huh?

00:25.959 --> 00:27.218
So, Tibor,

00:27.364 --> 00:29.616
tell us why you're excited
about a career in parking.

00:29.699 --> 00:30.950
Is good.

00:31.723 --> 00:32.983
That's a tough one.

00:33.085 --> 00:34.398
My top three...

00:35.460 --> 00:36.812
- Destiny's Child...
- Oh.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.193
- Janet Jackson...
- Yes.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.515
and my fave Metallica.

00:40.648 --> 00:42.804
Oh, my goodness, you are so complex.

00:42.952 --> 00:46.023
Tibor, what are your
favorite kinds of music?

00:46.233 --> 00:47.426
Tibor.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.655
Is good?

00:54.960 --> 00:56.335
Oh-oh.

00:56.671 --> 00:58.773
Well, I think the choice is clear.

00:58.851 --> 00:59.879
- Joan.
- Tibor.

00:59.912 --> 01:01.608
- Tibor?
- I like his energy.

01:01.780 --> 01:04.218
- He doesn't have any.
- Well, I like Joan. She's fun.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.171
Take her to the movies.
This is a business.

01:06.243 --> 01:07.444
Uh-oh.

01:07.843 --> 01:09.280
Looks like we're at a stand-off.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.851
God, not the coin.

01:10.991 --> 01:14.030
Even super-duper pals like
Jay and I disagree sometimes,

01:14.125 --> 01:17.812
so... I dreamed up this baby.

01:18.015 --> 01:20.280
If it comes up Phil, I win.

01:20.563 --> 01:23.124
If it comes up Jay, he wins.

01:23.390 --> 01:24.851
He hated this, but I told him,

01:24.929 --> 01:26.350
"The coin adds 10 pounds."

01:34.007 --> 01:36.694
<font color=#FF00FF>*MODERN FAMILY*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 08 Episode 20</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>"ALL Things Being Equal"</font>

01:41.054 --> 01:43.062
So, how hard-core is
this march going to be?

01:43.148 --> 01:44.489
Just a peaceful gathering of women

01:44.513 --> 01:46.091
working towards the
same goal of equality.

01:46.115 --> 01:47.773
We're not burning bras or anything.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.751
Good, 'cause I just got my first one.

01:49.874 --> 01:52.210
I'm not torching it
before Naomi's sleepover.

01:52.273 --> 01:54.249
This is a really exciting
time for you, Lily.

01:54.327 --> 01:56.233
This is your first taste of feminism.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.374
We're all here as your mentors...

01:58.570 --> 02:00.476
or "womentors".

02:00.530 --> 02:01.530
Hmm?

02:01.560 --> 02:02.810
Come on, I just coined that.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.710
We fake-laughed at "sheroic."

02:04.858 --> 02:05.999
The well is dry.

02:06.116 --> 02:07.983
This stupid traffic!

02:08.072 --> 02:09.727
Look at all these women
in these cars, Lily.

02:09.751 --> 02:11.538
It's so inspiring.

02:11.616 --> 02:12.757
All for one!

02:12.863 --> 02:15.616
- One for all...
- I am gonna cut around these idiots!

02:18.835 --> 02:20.084
What was that?

02:20.147 --> 02:21.981
Somebody shot out the tire!

02:22.052 --> 02:23.874
Really? That's where
you go with this?

02:23.986 --> 02:25.249
It was a pothole.

02:25.358 --> 02:27.249
The dashboard is going crazy.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.366
It's a flat tire. Perfect.

02:29.492 --> 02:31.523
I wouldn't know about "flat."

02:32.671 --> 02:33.960
Phil! Phil!

02:34.008 --> 02:35.084
We have a problem.

02:35.164 --> 02:36.898
Aww... "we"?

02:37.028 --> 02:39.530
I'm trying to get to that bakery
that makes those bear claws.

02:39.624 --> 02:42.327
That chatterbox you and your coin hired

02:42.398 --> 02:44.170
is clogging up our parking lot.

02:46.796 --> 02:48.523
Oh, great. There goes eight bucks.

02:48.648 --> 02:50.679
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.398
Is this an official partners' meeting?

02:52.632 --> 02:54.358
Hold on.

02:54.538 --> 02:55.694
Good morning and welcome.

02:55.748 --> 02:56.999
Partners present...

02:57.129 --> 02:59.049
- Phil Dunphy...
- Put down your stupid notebook.

02:59.117 --> 03:00.757
You're the one who wanted to hire her.

03:00.831 --> 03:03.163
You've got to tell her to
speed it up or hit the road.

03:03.259 --> 03:04.882
I want you to know
that I hear you

03:04.991 --> 03:06.991
and will address this post-haste.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.616
Now, if we could move on
to some unfinished business

03:09.722 --> 03:12.390
from the last meeting, um...

03:12.538 --> 03:14.780
"My feelings are still hurt

03:14.890 --> 03:16.413
"from you telling me

03:16.527 --> 03:18.905
"all the places you
want me to put the coin."

03:18.998 --> 03:20.542
Ah, it's after ten o'clock...

03:20.600 --> 03:22.068
too late to eat a bear claw now,

03:22.132 --> 03:23.445
I'll be too sugared up for my nap.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.002
Everything's ruined.

03:27.921 --> 03:29.643
Hey. You look busy.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.245
Oh, yeah, well, I'm just
putting the finishing touches

03:32.319 --> 03:34.554
on the costumes for this
year's school musical.

03:34.628 --> 03:36.280
You mean the one that's
supposedly based on your life,

03:36.304 --> 03:38.384
but is a beat-for-beat
rip-off of "The Wizard of Oz"?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.444
Mine is the story of
a precocious farm kid

03:40.542 --> 03:42.733
who takes a magical
journey to the big city.

03:42.837 --> 03:44.718
How is that "Wizard of Oz"?

03:44.813 --> 03:46.124
Cam, you have a Tin Man.

03:46.218 --> 03:47.733
That's our high-school mascot.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.010
We were the Mighty Milk Jugs.

03:49.101 --> 03:50.504
You know this.

03:51.553 --> 03:52.749
Hi, Pam.

03:52.801 --> 03:54.226
Hey, y'all.

03:54.644 --> 03:57.405
Listen, upstairs in the kitchen...

03:57.562 --> 03:59.069
- Mm-hmm.
- is there, um...

03:59.194 --> 04:00.796
one of those, uh...

04:00.932 --> 04:03.124
you know, things that, uh...

04:03.648 --> 04:04.999
Wait, what were you asking me?

04:05.060 --> 04:07.624
- Pam, are... are you okay?
- Oh, honey, you look exhausted.

04:07.741 --> 04:08.866
The baby didn't sleep again

04:08.935 --> 04:10.116
last night.

04:10.168 --> 04:11.637
I'll tell you, I haven't
been this out of sorts

04:11.661 --> 04:13.444
since that twister
lifted up our house.

04:13.523 --> 04:15.515
- Told ya.
- That wind was so strong

04:15.606 --> 04:17.197
- it shucked all our corn.
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.293 --> 04:19.476
It was like... whenev...

04:21.015 --> 04:22.649
- She sleeping?
- No, she's fine.

04:22.710 --> 04:24.969
Our plough horse used
to do the same thing.

04:27.108 --> 04:29.304
- Baby's crying.
- Okay, why don't I put this on pause.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.022
I'll come up and help
you out for a little bit.

04:31.046 --> 04:33.085
Oh, maybe Mitchell should help.

04:33.202 --> 04:36.273
- He's just so good with baby Calhoun.
- Aww.

04:36.328 --> 04:38.343
I ought to call you
"Uncle Secret Touch".

04:38.413 --> 04:41.133
That seems like a "500 feet away
from a playground" kind of nickname.

04:41.163 --> 04:42.538
But I will be happy to help.

04:42.577 --> 04:45.546
Okay, well, I'll just be down
here, in case nobody needs me.

04:45.842 --> 04:47.381
Hey, wh-why don't you
head upstairs.

04:47.428 --> 04:48.475
I-I'll be right up, okay?

04:48.508 --> 04:50.114
Oh, thank you.

04:50.451 --> 04:51.952
You know, you try to hide it,

04:52.006 --> 04:54.648
but you are a sensitive soul...

04:54.811 --> 04:56.538
"Uncle Sneaky Feeler".

04:56.616 --> 04:58.062
Yeah, before we go
wide with that,

04:58.139 --> 04:59.444
let's, um... not. Okay.

05:00.138 --> 05:01.315
Cam.

05:01.515 --> 05:03.826
What? I think it's great
that she's asking you

05:03.882 --> 05:05.398
to help out with baby Cal

05:05.510 --> 05:07.420
instead of his own flesh and blood.

05:07.538 --> 05:09.054
I guess the only thing I'm good for

05:09.090 --> 05:10.683
is putting on a wig and taking her SATs.

05:10.707 --> 05:12.460
I cannot believe you're jealous.

05:12.585 --> 05:14.794
I'm hardly jealous. I'm much too busy.

05:14.866 --> 05:16.562
Oh, finishing the flying monkeys?

05:16.710 --> 05:17.831
They're not flying monkeys.

05:17.921 --> 05:19.506
Let me ask you... what
do you think happens

05:19.530 --> 05:20.967
to possums during a tornado?

05:21.077 --> 05:22.171
Ugh.

05:23.093 --> 05:25.069
Park it over there, next to that Buick.

05:27.704 --> 05:29.062
There he is.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.959
Hey, Joan. How's
everything down here today?

05:31.062 --> 05:34.069
Putting cars in spaces
and smiles on faces.

05:34.265 --> 05:36.007
Well, except for yours.

05:36.115 --> 05:37.147
What's wrong?

05:37.198 --> 05:38.900
Oh, no, I'm good. Yeah, definitely good.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.194
Phil... if there's two things I know...

05:41.243 --> 05:43.093
it's people and parking.

05:43.165 --> 05:45.365
And you look like you trying
to get out of a tough spot.

05:45.459 --> 05:47.187
You see right through me.

05:47.741 --> 05:50.304
There was an issue at
our partners' meeting.

05:50.425 --> 05:51.398
Hold on one second.

05:51.444 --> 05:52.999
Hey, sugar!

05:53.149 --> 05:55.960
All right, girl, how
was the office party?

05:56.054 --> 05:57.819
I kept all my clothes on this time.

05:57.913 --> 05:58.960
And you were right...

05:59.018 --> 06:01.499
I stayed away from mixers
and I'm not hungover!

06:01.524 --> 06:02.538
See?!

06:02.611 --> 06:05.241
You can't lose if
it's nothing but booze.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.733
That deserves...

06:06.872 --> 06:08.437
confetti bomb!

06:08.663 --> 06:09.733
You're the greatest.

06:09.774 --> 06:11.780
Park it over there by that blue Toyota.

06:12.643 --> 06:13.938
My girl!

06:14.835 --> 06:16.398
She is a bit of a drinker,

06:16.490 --> 06:18.176
so I like to give her a lot of space.

06:18.265 --> 06:20.858
All right. Now, what did
you want to talk about?

06:21.077 --> 06:23.421
Nothing. Everything here is perfect.

06:23.507 --> 06:25.754
- Well, almost.
- Something on your mind?

06:25.905 --> 06:28.983
No, but something is on
my feet all day... me.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.476
How 'bout... a gel mat for the booth?

06:31.632 --> 06:33.288
Oh, I'm getting you a mat...

06:33.476 --> 06:34.562
'cause you're all that.

06:34.642 --> 06:36.905
Ooh! Ha ha!

06:37.014 --> 06:38.201
I love that!

06:38.632 --> 06:40.210
Confetti bomb!

06:42.093 --> 06:44.023
It wasn't like I was
checking up on him.

06:44.085 --> 06:47.747
I had my nap and I came
by for an afternoon claw.

06:49.890 --> 06:51.976
I don't have a lot going on right now.

06:54.218 --> 06:55.562
I think it's this one.

06:55.644 --> 06:58.015
Hey, guys, why don't we just
call roadside assistance?

06:58.099 --> 06:59.405
I'm sure they'll send somebody.

06:59.499 --> 07:01.507
If today is all about girl power,

07:01.602 --> 07:04.004
why can't we just fix it ourselves?

07:04.304 --> 07:06.343
I knew we shouldn't have brought her.

07:12.139 --> 07:13.186
It's funny...

07:13.265 --> 07:14.617
we've only been volunteering here

07:14.689 --> 07:16.617
- at the women's march for an hour...
- Five minutes.

07:16.641 --> 07:18.562
but it already feels like
I'm part of something big,

07:18.586 --> 07:20.217
something really special.

07:20.632 --> 07:21.928
Would you snap a picture?

07:22.092 --> 07:23.803
So you can prove you were
here and get school credit,

07:23.827 --> 07:25.319
and be home faster than
the ink dries

07:25.377 --> 07:26.952
on that poster you just misspelled?

07:27.077 --> 07:29.225
- "Women Untie"?
- Still works.

07:29.331 --> 07:31.331
Luke, these women
deserve our respect.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.452
They've had to overcome

07:32.513 --> 07:34.733
biases and challenges
we've never had to face.

07:34.803 --> 07:36.843
They're the granddaughters
of the suffrage movement.

07:36.895 --> 07:38.335
Sitting through your
little speech...

07:38.452 --> 07:39.803
that's suffrage.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.652
Oh, my God.

07:41.763 --> 07:43.663
I-It's Danielle Pardo from calculus.

07:43.701 --> 07:45.099
- Who?
- You wouldn't know her.

07:45.194 --> 07:46.460
You run in different circles.

07:46.522 --> 07:49.342
She's in honors classes and
you, well, run in circles.

07:49.490 --> 07:51.057
Hey, Manny!

07:51.350 --> 07:52.592
It's so cool you're here.

07:52.668 --> 07:54.467
And I'm here, too Luke Dunphy.

07:54.576 --> 07:57.389
You saw me now and you saw
me at the end of the march.

07:57.702 --> 07:59.085
If you guys are making signs,

07:59.155 --> 08:00.374
here are some of the issues...

08:00.467 --> 08:02.842
women make 79 cents on the dollar,

08:03.038 --> 08:05.515
and the government wants to tell
me what I can do with my body.

08:05.539 --> 08:06.750
I mean, how would you feel if...

08:06.774 --> 08:07.819
Whoa!

08:07.853 --> 08:09.230
She blew my mind.

08:09.318 --> 08:12.241
Society treats girls like
second-class citizens.

08:12.420 --> 08:14.506
I've spent a lot of
time on women's websites,

08:14.624 --> 08:16.701
but none of this stuff ever came up.

08:16.921 --> 08:19.382
You're watching strong
women in action, Lily.

08:19.424 --> 08:20.884
When we put our minds together,

08:21.060 --> 08:23.413
there's nothing we can't achieve.

08:24.627 --> 08:25.925
This is too hard.

08:25.981 --> 08:27.570
Ugh. I give up.

08:27.635 --> 08:30.064
- Let's just get the manual.
- Great idea. I like that.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.976
You see, Lily, there are no
fairy tales,

08:32.054 --> 08:33.625
no damsels in distress.

08:33.774 --> 08:36.352
We are more than just
a bunch of pretty faces.

08:37.023 --> 08:38.739
There's nothing in the
glove box but makeup.

08:38.763 --> 08:40.683
Ay, yeah, because the
manual wouldn't fit

08:40.764 --> 08:43.168
with my emergency touch-up kit.

08:43.359 --> 08:44.539
I would like to revisit

08:44.617 --> 08:46.273
Gloria's idea about giving up.

08:46.329 --> 08:48.149
Oh, that's setting a great example.

08:48.305 --> 08:50.485
What do you think would've happened
if Marie Curie had given up?

08:50.509 --> 08:52.649
She wouldn't have died
of radiation poisoning.

08:52.819 --> 08:56.032
- How on Earth did you know that?
- You talk about her a lot.

08:56.126 --> 08:57.556
Until I saw her on that stamp,

08:57.611 --> 08:58.971
I thought she was your girlfriend.

08:59.012 --> 09:01.757
Gloria, I can't believe you
don't know how to change a tire.

09:01.843 --> 09:04.452
You drove a taxi. Surely you had a flat.

09:04.647 --> 09:06.116
I had a lot of flats,

09:06.280 --> 09:08.177
but I would reapply my makeup

09:08.289 --> 09:09.568
and I would wait and then,

09:09.686 --> 09:12.569
in five minutes, I would
have my own pit crew.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.981
You know, after we
get this tire changed,

09:15.098 --> 09:16.280
do you still want to go to
the rally

09:16.304 --> 09:18.226
or should we just drop
you off in 1950?

09:18.309 --> 09:20.739
- Uh, guys, there's, uh...
- Oh.

09:24.674 --> 09:25.909
- You need help with that tire?
- No.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.534
- No, we don't. We're good, thanks.
- No.

09:27.574 --> 09:28.818
What are you guys talking about?

09:28.842 --> 09:30.557
She's a woman and she
wants to help with the tire.

09:30.581 --> 09:32.028
She checks all the boxes.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.473
Right. Um...

09:33.498 --> 09:34.582
Hello.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.731
Uh, we were trying to
change our tire,

09:36.802 --> 09:39.389
but there's something
wrong with the jack.

09:39.485 --> 09:41.395
- Let me check it out.
- Yep.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.286
Uh-huh. Oh, that.

09:43.351 --> 09:44.855
- Okay.
- There we go.

09:44.998 --> 09:46.434
I guess I should have moved that one.

09:46.458 --> 09:47.560
Yeah.

09:48.425 --> 09:49.655
You're hired.

09:49.728 --> 09:51.713
Great. Let's get this
baby off the ground.

09:51.778 --> 09:53.036
I'm Joey, by the way.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.268
- Hi.
- Thank you.

09:56.312 --> 09:57.849
I'm Haley.

09:58.940 --> 10:01.535
What? She's awesome. It's confusing.

10:03.518 --> 10:05.264
I read your script, baby.

10:05.385 --> 10:07.033
If you got third-act problems,

10:07.134 --> 10:08.737
you got first-act problems.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.096
You are so right.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.393
Park it next to the Honda

10:11.487 --> 10:13.315
and flesh out your antagonist.

10:14.471 --> 10:16.142
- Hey.
- Hey, Jay.

10:16.229 --> 10:18.018
How's Gloria, Manny, Joe, and Stella?

10:18.078 --> 10:19.218
What, do you got index cards?

10:19.242 --> 10:21.710
Listen, your chattiness is
gumming up the works here.

10:21.806 --> 10:22.967
You're not here to socialize,

10:23.009 --> 10:24.185
so just get 'em in, get 'em out.

10:24.209 --> 10:25.916
Are you asking me not
to talk to people?

10:25.970 --> 10:28.057
'Cause that is what I do.

10:28.158 --> 10:29.837
And Phil don't seem to
have a problem with it.

10:29.861 --> 10:30.971
No, but I do.

10:31.058 --> 10:33.026
Well, to quote Sammy Davis Jr.,

10:33.080 --> 10:34.680
"I got to be me."

10:34.728 --> 10:37.064
Well, to quote Frank Sinatra,
who I met once at a restaurant,

10:37.088 --> 10:39.041
"Get out of my booth."

10:39.134 --> 10:40.664
Okay.

10:43.370 --> 10:44.859
Fine...

10:45.104 --> 10:46.343
with me.

10:49.042 --> 10:51.783
- Hey. Where do I park?
- Between two lines.

10:55.101 --> 10:57.031
Ugh, my old squash injury.

10:57.127 --> 10:58.510
Oh, you played squash?

10:58.589 --> 11:01.226
No. I grew the heaviest
one in the county.

11:01.314 --> 11:02.325
Oh...

11:03.125 --> 11:05.494
I had to carry it inside every night,

11:05.726 --> 11:07.526
- on account of poachers.
- Mm.

11:07.618 --> 11:10.152
Hi, little baby Calhoun.

11:10.213 --> 11:12.033
It's your uncle Cam...

11:12.136 --> 11:13.970
your real uncle, not that guy Mitchell,

11:14.034 --> 11:15.868
who's just somebody I met at a party.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.033
You and I are gonna be
the best friends

11:18.119 --> 11:19.510
in the whole wide...

11:20.707 --> 11:22.104
No, no, no, no!

11:22.230 --> 11:23.580
Why would you wake the baby?!

11:23.652 --> 11:24.713
Well, I just was...

11:24.800 --> 11:26.143
He was finally asleep!

11:26.238 --> 11:27.658
- I was just...
- I-I got him.

11:27.744 --> 11:28.981
I got him. It's gonna be okay.

11:29.041 --> 11:30.721
Come here, baby.

11:30.858 --> 11:31.998
- Aww.
- Okay...

11:32.156 --> 11:33.369
- Shh...
- Thank you.

11:33.463 --> 11:34.730
I was about to wig out

11:34.788 --> 11:36.231
worse than Princess Margaret

11:36.323 --> 11:38.549
when her boyfriend was
banished by Elizabeth.

11:38.666 --> 11:41.459
- Oh, yep.
- You watched "The Crown" without me?!

11:42.403 --> 11:43.528
- Come on, Cal.
- Yeah.

11:43.592 --> 11:46.737
It's no fun watching this angry queen.

11:48.001 --> 11:49.291
Aw.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.551
I can't believe you.

11:50.616 --> 11:51.737
We're only on episode four

11:51.835 --> 11:53.433
and there are literally no spoilers.

11:53.528 --> 11:56.088
I'm talking about you and
your weird, new, little family.

11:56.158 --> 11:57.799
You have turned that baby against me.

11:57.853 --> 11:58.917
What did you say to him?

11:58.987 --> 12:01.023
Cam, only you could turn
this into something negative.

12:01.047 --> 12:03.925
There's nothing wrong with your
sister and I becoming closer.

12:04.010 --> 12:06.027
We have a very special relationship...

12:06.151 --> 12:08.606
kind of like the one the queen
had with her private secretary.

12:08.760 --> 12:09.908
You son of a bitch!

12:09.987 --> 12:12.109
It's history.

12:12.710 --> 12:14.549
Do you know that there
are only a handful

12:14.674 --> 12:16.752
of female C.E.O.s in
the entire Fortune 500?

12:16.830 --> 12:17.867
That's crazy.

12:17.948 --> 12:20.065
Women can drive a race-car
just as well as a man.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.354
- You joke.
- Huh?

12:21.415 --> 12:24.221
I'm only in high school and I
see casual sexism on the daily.

12:24.334 --> 12:26.041
I know. I hear the way Mr. Easton

12:26.147 --> 12:28.004
- "mansplains" everything to you.
- What's that?

12:28.028 --> 12:29.580
It's when a man tries
to explain something

12:29.604 --> 12:30.985
to a woman that she
already knows.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.791
Are you mansplaining

12:32.971 --> 12:34.870
"mansplaining" to me right now?

12:35.291 --> 12:37.283
I was talking about your snack.

12:37.660 --> 12:38.901
It's trail mix.

12:39.028 --> 12:42.397
You know who else blazed a
trail... Geraldine Ferraro!

12:42.649 --> 12:44.839
Hey, Joan, it's me...

12:45.612 --> 12:47.198
Mat-man.

12:48.151 --> 12:49.690
What are you doing here? Where's Joan?

12:49.762 --> 12:51.556
You were supposed to
handle it, but you didn't,

12:51.580 --> 12:54.213
so I had to take time out
of my extremely busy day

12:54.299 --> 12:55.553
and try to straighten her out.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.963
But she didn't go along with
the program, so she's gone.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.415
You did this without
talking to me?

12:59.439 --> 13:00.716
We're supposed to be partners.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.212
We're gonna hire that Tibor guy.

13:02.284 --> 13:04.657
He barely speaks English, but
there'll be no chattiness...

13:04.729 --> 13:06.033
although I did try that with Gloria,

13:06.057 --> 13:08.432
and eventually they watch so
much TV they figure it out.

13:08.510 --> 13:10.604
- But the coin decided.
- Screw the coin!

13:10.659 --> 13:13.846
There's no line, and Joan never
had this many cars in the lot.

13:13.963 --> 13:16.065
People liked her! She was good at this!

13:16.132 --> 13:19.018
Relax. This is parking
cars, not building closets.

13:19.101 --> 13:20.362
Excuse me?

13:20.503 --> 13:22.190
There's like four cars blocking me in.

13:22.271 --> 13:23.869
I'll get them out of
your way in a jiffy.

13:23.893 --> 13:24.973
Oh, no!

13:25.033 --> 13:26.213
- Oh.
- Oh, no!!

13:26.315 --> 13:28.979
"Oh, no" is right. The
yoga class just got out.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.237
Here, stand on this.

13:30.346 --> 13:32.534
You might be here for a while.

13:34.658 --> 13:35.955
So good.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.156
Pam?

13:40.385 --> 13:42.158
- Hmm?
- Hey... okay.

13:42.401 --> 13:43.768
L-Let's go to bed.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.327
No. I'm not tired.

13:45.393 --> 13:47.297
No, this is why your neck
and shoulders always hurt,

13:47.321 --> 13:48.658
'cause you're falling
asleep standing up.

13:48.682 --> 13:50.696
Come on, let's get you to bed. Come on.

13:50.776 --> 13:51.854
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:51.925 --> 13:53.151
Okay, all right.

13:53.237 --> 13:54.393
- Ah, my prince.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.448
Mmm...

13:57.541 --> 13:58.838
Oh, my God!

13:58.877 --> 14:00.071
Oh, my God.

14:00.916 --> 14:02.206
Oh, my God.

14:05.096 --> 14:06.510
All right, everybody relax.

14:06.621 --> 14:08.654
Calm down! Calm down.

14:08.795 --> 14:10.486
Who drives the Prius?

14:11.728 --> 14:13.562
With a "Whole Foods" reward card?

14:13.665 --> 14:15.813
Where's Joan? I need my car.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.452
Confetti bomb.

14:18.563 --> 14:19.844
We're full.

14:19.962 --> 14:21.438
Everything's fine.

14:21.548 --> 14:23.517
- I've rehired Joan.
- We don't need her.

14:23.625 --> 14:26.204
Who drives the car with the silver keys?

14:26.289 --> 14:28.087
Phil, am I doing this or not?

14:28.148 --> 14:31.061
Joan, the lot is yours.

14:32.165 --> 14:35.110
All right. Wendy, let's
get you in that minivan

14:35.180 --> 14:36.848
and home to your diabetic cat.

14:36.873 --> 14:39.728
You cannot unilaterally
rehire her, Phil.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.749
You mean like how you fired
her without talking to me?

14:41.773 --> 14:43.014
If we disagree about something,

14:43.041 --> 14:44.608
we're supposed to flip over it.

14:44.657 --> 14:46.911
Maybe we should flip over whether
we should even be partners.

14:46.935 --> 14:49.009
- Maybe we should do it right now.
- Great.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.962
If it comes up Phil, we keep going.

14:51.049 --> 14:53.302
If it comes up Jay, we end it.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.665
- What are you two fools doing?
- This isn't working out.

14:57.713 --> 15:01.391
And it's not gonna until you start
treating this man like your equal.

15:01.493 --> 15:03.293
You think you're some big-shot boss

15:03.337 --> 15:04.798
and you can just push him around.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.730
- Thank you, Joan.
- Zip it!

15:06.813 --> 15:08.771
You let him do it. Mm?

15:08.884 --> 15:10.235
Do yourself a favor...

15:10.335 --> 15:13.423
learn something from
Jay, like how to be tough.

15:13.518 --> 15:16.438
You guys don't need a stupid coin.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.719
You need each other.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.805
Now... say something nice.

15:23.257 --> 15:24.415
Um...

15:24.549 --> 15:27.665
I always... I always have
admired your toughness.

15:27.821 --> 15:29.993
All right. Your turn.

15:30.251 --> 15:32.369
I always thought you were...

15:33.150 --> 15:34.596
happy.

15:35.126 --> 15:36.994
See? Ha!

15:39.140 --> 15:40.441
Ahh!

15:40.521 --> 15:42.688
And that is how you do that.

15:44.279 --> 15:45.546
Oh. Hey, there you are.

15:45.587 --> 15:46.892
Listen, it was wrong of me

15:46.978 --> 15:48.555
to say something weird was going on

15:48.634 --> 15:50.090
between you and Pameron.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.235
I don't know what I was thinking.

15:51.259 --> 15:53.384
Clearly, you guys
have a perfectly normal

15:53.461 --> 15:56.263
sister-and-gay-brother
in-law relationship.

15:56.345 --> 15:58.009
You saw it on the baby
monitor, didn't you?

15:58.033 --> 16:00.129
It was even creepier in night vision.

16:00.212 --> 16:01.278
I don't know what happened.

16:01.302 --> 16:02.742
Y-You both have the same lips and...

16:02.790 --> 16:04.171
and you kiss the same and...

16:04.251 --> 16:05.995
We did learn to kiss
on the same hedge post.

16:06.063 --> 16:07.487
Ew.

16:09.377 --> 16:11.782
Mitchell, could I speak
to you in private, please?

16:11.846 --> 16:14.024
Why? Do you want to
do some more neckin'?

16:14.182 --> 16:16.767
- You were bragging on it?
- He saw it on the baby monitor.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.685
And you were watching,
you horny toad?

16:18.767 --> 16:19.920
Pam, let's calm down.

16:20.017 --> 16:22.156
You're kind of embarrassing yourself.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.040
I know!

16:24.165 --> 16:26.727
I'm such a mess!

16:26.853 --> 16:29.273
I'm just so tired!

16:29.664 --> 16:32.845
Plus, I fell asleep to the scene
of the queen's horses doing it!

16:32.934 --> 16:35.579
- Hello? Spoiler alert.
- It's just...

16:35.665 --> 16:37.978
I'm sorry if I've been such a burden.

16:38.087 --> 16:40.517
- No, you're not a burden.
- No, no, you're not a burden.

16:40.675 --> 16:42.243
No, come on, listen...

16:42.343 --> 16:43.539
the truth is, I've kind of enjoyed

16:43.563 --> 16:45.045
being super-daddy to a baby,

16:45.118 --> 16:46.555
you know, 'cause I've never had that.

16:46.579 --> 16:48.858
Oh, what are you talking about?
You were great with Lily.

16:48.931 --> 16:50.345
No, you were great with Lily.

16:50.431 --> 16:52.032
In the beginning, I...

16:52.120 --> 16:54.689
I was a mess, so I
let you take the lead.

16:55.384 --> 16:56.774
I don't know, m-maybe I'm just...

16:56.829 --> 16:58.610
trying to prove something to myself.

16:58.693 --> 16:59.960
Oh, sweetie, I had no idea.

17:00.009 --> 17:01.219
But you don't have
anything to prove

17:01.243 --> 17:03.235
because you're a great dad.

17:03.337 --> 17:04.731
You both are...

17:04.820 --> 17:06.642
but I'm a disaster.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.970
- No, white couch. Let's get you up.
- White couch.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.505
I don't think I can
do all this by myself.

17:11.579 --> 17:12.961
Well, you know what, the good news is,

17:12.984 --> 17:14.936
is you don't have to do
any of this all by yourself,

17:14.961 --> 17:17.021
because you have a family
right down here who loves you

17:17.045 --> 17:19.867
and will do anything we
need to do to help you.

17:21.715 --> 17:24.048
Good. That means the world to me.

17:24.181 --> 17:27.462
And besides... I know that cry,

17:27.555 --> 17:29.342
and somebody else is
changing that diaper.

17:29.367 --> 17:30.367
- Not it.
- Not it.

17:30.436 --> 17:31.536
Ugh.

17:33.614 --> 17:35.435
So, women can't win.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.763
They're penalized if they work

17:36.825 --> 17:38.565
and they're penalized if they stay home.

17:38.661 --> 17:40.092
Exactly!

17:40.239 --> 17:41.919
You know, Luke, when
I woke up this morning

17:41.958 --> 17:43.858
and came to the rally...

17:44.310 --> 17:46.286
I never thought I would
meet somebody like you.

17:46.406 --> 17:47.960
You're up.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.874
It's my turn.

17:54.497 --> 17:56.083
I can't believe she's falling for this.

17:56.184 --> 17:57.989
I've believed in this
cause my whole life.

17:58.052 --> 17:59.453
You spend an afternoon faking it

17:59.497 --> 18:00.965
and she kisses you almost on the lips.

18:00.989 --> 18:02.575
I'm not faking anything.

18:02.657 --> 18:04.231
She got through to me.

18:04.324 --> 18:07.403
Women and girls and
the men who honor us...

18:07.520 --> 18:09.473
It's a crime what women in
this country have to go through,

18:09.497 --> 18:10.747
and I'm with her 100%.

18:10.832 --> 18:14.294
We will never accomplish
anything without sacrifice.

18:14.368 --> 18:15.755
Damn straight!

18:15.860 --> 18:18.083
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for it to happen, but...

18:18.204 --> 18:19.567
Danielle and I made a connection

18:19.625 --> 18:21.405
and I'm sticking with
her as long as it takes.

18:21.429 --> 18:24.297
That's why, until women
have true equality,

18:24.388 --> 18:26.980
I will remain celibate.

18:27.145 --> 18:28.482
Let's get out of here.

18:30.364 --> 18:32.552
Now that the jack is lowered

18:32.638 --> 18:34.310
and all the lug nuts are snug,

18:34.390 --> 18:36.402
you just got to tighten
everything in a cross pattern.

18:36.426 --> 18:37.476
- Oh.
- Oh.

18:37.513 --> 18:38.567
Why don't you each do one?

18:38.697 --> 18:41.154
If it's okay, I'd rather
not get grease all over me.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.774
Hey, you can't change the world
without getting your hands dirty.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.606
Whoa.

18:45.778 --> 18:47.430
Okay. Give me that.

18:49.989 --> 18:51.321
You're right.

18:51.395 --> 18:52.528
This is great.

18:52.614 --> 18:55.235
- It feels like I can do anything.
- You're loosening it.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.716
Oh. Oh, sorry.

18:56.841 --> 18:58.356
Thank you, Joey.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.083
You did that so fast.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.739
Well, cars are in my blood.

19:01.816 --> 19:03.817
You know, my grandmother
ran her own garage.

19:03.989 --> 19:05.349
That's so awesome.

19:05.453 --> 19:07.131
There must have been a
lot of prejudice back then.

19:07.155 --> 19:08.993
There was... but eventually,

19:09.114 --> 19:11.063
she started fixing Irish people's cars.

19:11.685 --> 19:12.755
Huh.

19:12.821 --> 19:15.437
Well, uh, Lily, why
don't you finish it off.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.583
I'm not strong enough.

19:20.685 --> 19:22.298
Well, then let me help you.

19:22.419 --> 19:23.704
We're stronger together.

19:23.841 --> 19:25.391
Whoa.

19:25.536 --> 19:28.466
Wow. We are stronger together.

19:28.802 --> 19:30.302
Oh, I'm sorry I put you down before.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.512
You are a formidable woman, Gloria.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.704
You deserve respect.

19:33.786 --> 19:36.145
No, Claire, you are the
one that deserves respect.

19:36.244 --> 19:39.700
You have raised three wonderful
children, you run a company,

19:39.817 --> 19:42.222
you don't waste time
on silly things like...

19:42.364 --> 19:43.890
the way your hair looks.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.591
You just get things done.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.273
And that is it. You guys are all set.

19:48.341 --> 19:50.668
Thank you so much. Is there any
way we could pay you for your time?

19:50.692 --> 19:52.208
No, no, absolutely not.

19:52.267 --> 19:53.696
I'm happy to help.

19:53.721 --> 19:55.543
But let me just reset
your tire-pressure monitor

19:55.567 --> 19:56.762
so that thing doesn't
beep at you all day.

19:56.786 --> 19:58.942
- Yes, please. Go right ahead.
- See that, Lily?

19:58.994 --> 20:00.423
We didn't need a man to
help us get out of this.

20:00.447 --> 20:03.083
This is what happens when
women help other women.

20:09.372 --> 20:12.302
She's probably just making
sure it works, right?

20:12.653 --> 20:14.731
So that bitch stole my car.

20:14.927 --> 20:17.099
On a positive note, it
is nice to see a woman

20:17.177 --> 20:19.895
break into a previously
male-dominated field.

20:20.030 --> 20:22.265
My makeup was not insured.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.669
It's the perfect solution.

20:27.739 --> 20:28.942
Can't we just make a decision?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.066
What's going on?

20:30.105 --> 20:31.464
Oh, your father and
I have been arguing

20:31.488 --> 20:32.676
about something for over an hour.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.947
Fortunately, I've made a special coin

20:33.971 --> 20:35.638
with my face on one side

20:35.685 --> 20:36.882
and your mom's on the other.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.653
Ugh, Susan B. Unflattering.

20:38.706 --> 20:40.052
Okay, here we go.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.130
- It came up Claire.
- Yep!

20:43.231 --> 20:45.114
- Getting cremated!
- Damn it!

20:45.224 --> 20:46.549
Okay, here's another one...

20:46.630 --> 20:49.591
my head, we use our nest
egg for a beach condo.

20:49.661 --> 20:51.654
Yours, the kids' safety net.

20:51.755 --> 20:53.090
Hey, not cool.

20:54.092 --> 20:55.226
- Aw.
- Aw.

20:55.259 --> 20:56.497
I'm so sorry, you guys.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.727
Aw, you can come visit.

20:57.794 --> 21:00.177
You know, if you can afford it.

21:00.258 --> 21:02.264
