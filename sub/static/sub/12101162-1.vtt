WEBVTT

01:36.052 --> 01:37.619
- Sleepin' already?

01:40.056 --> 01:44.147
- Someone must've worn
me out.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.409
That looks good on you.

01:45.453 --> 01:46.758
- It's so fancy.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.588
- What do you think
we can get for it?

01:50.632 --> 01:52.112
- I wanna keep it.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.533
- Hey, Marie, stay inside.

04:56.774 --> 04:57.601
- Everett?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.952
Did we drink all the beer?

05:20.450 --> 05:21.321
Everett?

05:27.414 --> 05:28.240
Everett.

05:40.165 --> 05:40.992
Hello?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.142
- Shit, shit, shit.

07:15.304 --> 07:18.263
Hey, hey. We have to
go right now, okay?

07:18.307 --> 07:19.613
Come on.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.831
- It found me.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.751
It's inside me.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.235
- No!

07:48.511 --> 07:49.338
No!

07:51.601 --> 07:52.907
No!

10:17.094 --> 10:19.140
- Oh, yeah. Yeah,
this is perfect.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.358
See, this is exactly
the kinda place

10:20.402 --> 10:21.925
I was talkin' about, guys.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.753
It's a shame Dennis isn't here.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.015
He'd love to see this.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.887
Knowin' the popular
culture behind Bigfoot

10:26.930 --> 10:28.628
is a great way to
learn more about him.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.281
In fact, with any
kind of cryptid-

10:30.325 --> 10:33.502
- We just need that
lighter fluid, Oz.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.247
- Hello.

11:08.972 --> 11:12.019
- Hey, hi. Could you turn
that down for a quick sec?

11:14.195 --> 11:16.284
Hello? Yeah, hey.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.547
Yeah, sorry. I saw you called.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.332
Did you try... Yeah, yeah.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.117
No, did you try the zip file?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.727
Yeah, no problem. Happy to help.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.381
Okay, bye. Bye bye.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.428
- Your work know you're going
off the grid this weekend?

11:30.472 --> 11:31.995
- Oh, well, Isabelle
said there'd be

11:32.039 --> 11:34.781
service at the cabin, so...

11:34.824 --> 11:35.825
Oh.

11:35.869 --> 11:36.696
Shoot.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.875
Well, uh, maybe this
is a good thing, right?

11:41.918 --> 11:44.181
Give my boss a chance to
Google something for a change.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.793
Where is everybody?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.229
- Pit stop.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.448
- So what class is
this for anyway?

11:50.492 --> 11:52.581
- It's called cryptozoology.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.105
We study mythical
folklore animals.

11:55.149 --> 11:55.932
- Wow.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.413
What's your major?

11:58.456 --> 12:00.763
Photojournalism.

12:00.807 --> 12:01.677
- Oh.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.375
Huh.

12:04.419 --> 12:05.899
- We're all just trying
to finish up our masters.

12:05.942 --> 12:09.641
Everyone said this class
was an easy A, so...

12:09.685 --> 12:11.165
Oz in there is our TA.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.819
He'll give you an
earful, if you want it.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.124
- Good to know.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.868
- So, uh, you and Isabelle, huh?

12:18.912 --> 12:19.739
- Yeah.

12:21.218 --> 12:24.134
You know, we've only known
each other two months, but,

12:24.178 --> 12:25.266
I don't know.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.051
- She's cool, but uh...

12:29.270 --> 12:31.576
A nice guy like you?

12:31.620 --> 12:35.406
Honestly, she'll chew
you up and spit you out.

12:35.450 --> 12:40.150
- Well, um, I haven't exactly
gotten chewed up yet, so...

12:41.282 --> 12:45.765
We're
probably good, right?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.289
- Pretty slow today, huh?

12:48.332 --> 12:50.813
- Always is in the Dead Month.

12:50.857 --> 12:54.469
- Every year around this
time, people go missing.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.688
- Explains why the
cabin was so cheap.

12:56.732 --> 13:00.170
- What do they just get like
lost in the woods or something?

13:00.214 --> 13:03.521
- Well, no one knows for
sure what happens, but uh,

13:05.828 --> 13:07.830
- Oh, god.
- Yeah.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.963
- I thought you told us
that Bigfoot is harmless?

13:10.006 --> 13:12.835
- Well, no, he is, he
is. I said it's a theory.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.271
It just happens to be a bad one.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.664
Tell you what,
I'll be right back.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.840
Let me try to call Professor
Kasdan again, yeah?

13:17.884 --> 13:18.710
Awesome.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.280
- Our buddy here
thinks we're gonna

13:23.324 --> 13:25.717
run into Mr. Sasquatch
this weekend.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.589
You ever see anything?

13:29.156 --> 13:31.811
- That beast you're lookin' for.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.029
It's out there.

13:38.687 --> 13:43.300
There's an unspeakable evil
livin' out in those woods there.

13:43.344 --> 13:48.001
And you better hope it
doesn't sense your presence,

13:48.044 --> 13:50.830
because if it
knows you're there,

13:52.005 --> 13:55.660
they'll be coming
for ya.

13:55.704 --> 13:56.705
- Okay, then.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.578
What's the damage?

14:00.622 --> 14:01.405
- $52.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.843
75 cents.

14:03.886 --> 14:04.713
- Yeesh.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.674
Hey, keep the change.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.372
Dead Month and everything.

14:11.415 --> 14:12.764
- Safe journeys.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.174
- Hey, are you sure
it's okay that I'm here?

14:31.218 --> 14:35.483
I didn't realize I'd be the
only non-student tagging along.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.006
- Oh, yeah. No, trust me.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.530
Professor Kasdan
is like thrilled

14:39.574 --> 14:41.881
to have another person
forced to listen to him.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.752
Just, you know, relax.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.885
Try to have fun.

14:50.411 --> 14:53.240
You didn't wanna
wear your khakis?

14:54.415 --> 14:55.242
- Oh!

14:56.069 --> 14:57.679
No, I, I love them.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.597
Now?

15:03.815 --> 15:07.776
- Yeah, I mean, I got
them for you to wear.

15:07.819 --> 15:08.646
- Right.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.911
Right, yeah.

15:11.954 --> 15:15.915
I mean, I'm not sure they're
exactly meant for hiking.

15:15.958 --> 15:20.049
But uh,
I'll give it a shot.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.485
Yeah?

15:21.529 --> 15:22.573
Okay.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.314
- Oh, I have to pee.
- Oh.

15:24.358 --> 15:25.794
Sorry, babe.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.973
- You're in for quite
a treat this weekend

15:31.017 --> 15:34.020
as we delve into our
new area of study.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.847
In the last 20 years,
there've been over

15:35.891 --> 15:38.372
two dozen sightings in the area.

15:38.415 --> 15:42.028
Today is about
exploring the territory!

15:42.071 --> 15:44.421
Finding clues, evidence!

15:44.465 --> 15:48.295
And that could be tree markings,
that could be footprints.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.471
That could be feces.

15:50.514 --> 15:54.997
Anything that sheds light
on the existence of Bigfoot!

16:02.874 --> 16:04.311
- Hey.

16:04.354 --> 16:07.967
How did the snowman feel
when he got the flu?

16:13.233 --> 16:14.625
- Hey, you know we
should probably catch
up with the others.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.323
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.286
- My little explorers,
keep your eyes peeled,

16:23.330 --> 16:26.594
and you might wind up
in tomorrow's headlines.

16:26.637 --> 16:27.682
Back in 1811-

16:29.031 --> 16:30.772
- Hey, guys!

16:30.815 --> 16:31.860
I think I'm gonna stick around

16:31.903 --> 16:33.296
and watch this
black-capped Chickadee.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.863
Anyone wanna join?

16:36.212 --> 16:39.607
- You know what? We'll just,
we'll wind back around.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.261
- Oh, yeah.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.218
Cool beans.

16:44.481 --> 16:48.137
- Explorers say that
Bigfoot often throws rocks

16:48.181 --> 16:50.618
at trespassers, as a warning.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.057
- It's so refreshing
to be with someone

16:55.101 --> 16:57.581
who actually listens for once.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.844
I mean, Chris is literally
the opposite of Dan.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.759
He's such a douche bag.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.153
I mean, you like him, right?

17:04.197 --> 17:07.287
- You mean the human
dad joke back there?

17:07.330 --> 17:11.030
- Maybe that's what I need,
though. Someone uncomplicated.

17:11.073 --> 17:11.900
Simple.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.163
- Hey, guys.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.556
Let's turn here.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.689
- Shouldn't we
stay on the trail?

17:19.734 --> 17:22.215
- I doubt Bigfoot does trails.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.394
- Bigfoot doesn't do trails.

17:51.896 --> 17:52.723
- Hello.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.379
Are you a tourist?

17:56.423 --> 17:58.251
- Camera give it away?

17:59.730 --> 18:01.558
What're you lookin' at?

18:03.604 --> 18:07.216
- That is a mark
of a goddamn beast.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.524
- Bigfoot?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.308
- What the fuck else?

18:14.267 --> 18:17.792
- Hey, do you mind if
I get a picture of you?

18:20.664 --> 18:22.927
- Where are y'all staying?

18:22.971 --> 18:23.798
- A cabin.

18:25.756 --> 18:26.670
- Where at?

18:29.543 --> 18:30.587
- The woods.

18:33.982 --> 18:37.159
- You know, you
oughta watch yourself.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.684
Skinny little girl
off the trail.

18:40.728 --> 18:41.555
All alone.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.386
It's lookin' like prime
bait, if you ask me.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.519
Especially in Dead Month.

18:49.563 --> 18:54.220
- Well, hey. This has been
great but I'm gonna head off.

18:58.702 --> 18:59.529
Oh, hey.

19:01.009 --> 19:04.491
If you see Squatch,
tell him "hi" from me.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.643
- Aw, damn it.

19:31.648 --> 19:34.303
- Oh, whatever did this is huge.

19:41.528 --> 19:42.659
It's Bigfoot.

19:42.703 --> 19:46.185
- What're you
gonna do, taste it?

19:47.882 --> 19:48.709
Jeez!

19:50.232 --> 19:51.059
Fuck me.

19:54.062 --> 19:57.021
We gotta report this. There
was service near that shop.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.502
let's
just take a second here.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.417
- Oz, there's a
fucking dead body.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.245
- No, skeleton, all right?

20:03.289 --> 20:06.248
It takes eight to twelve
years for a body to decompose.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.250
- Great tip. You
should be a doctor.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.209
All right, let's go.

20:10.252 --> 20:13.081
- Guys, guys! There's
no rush to report this.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.300
I mean, whoever this was,

20:14.343 --> 20:16.345
they've been missing
for a very long time.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.651
What's a few more days?

20:17.694 --> 20:19.522
- Oz, I know you have a
huge hard-on for Bigfoot

20:19.566 --> 20:21.481
and everything, but we didn't
sign up to fucking obstruct

20:21.524 --> 20:22.786
a missing persons case.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.571
- Is this ideal? No.

20:24.614 --> 20:25.659
But Dennis and I
have been waiting

20:25.702 --> 20:27.835
all semester for this trip.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.054
I say we stay the weekend.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.014
All right, so, you
prefer to go back

20:33.057 --> 20:35.277
and listen to more
lectures instead?

20:35.321 --> 20:37.236
Trust me, I have a lot
to say on this topic,

20:37.279 --> 20:39.194
and without this
hands-on experience,

20:39.238 --> 20:41.109
I'm gonna need twice the
amount of essays from you guys

20:41.152 --> 20:43.851
to make sure you
know your stuff.

20:45.069 --> 20:48.551
- We report this
the second we leave.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.467
- The moment the
trip is over, yes.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.123
- Okay, yeah. Fine.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.560
- It probably goes
without saying, but,

20:57.604 --> 20:59.606
we shouldn't mention
this to the others.

20:59.649 --> 21:02.957
Don't wanna stir up
a panic over nothing', right?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.394
And uh, we can't tell Dennis.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.744
- Yeah, I mean, god forbid
the loonie professor

21:07.788 --> 21:10.051
with the not-so-secret
alcoholism gets in trouble.

21:10.094 --> 21:13.837
- I'm serious. The less
he knows, the better.

22:08.544 --> 22:09.371
- Hey.

22:16.552 --> 22:17.858
Quite the view.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.079
I thought I saw
something in the woods.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.386
It could've been a
deer or a moose or-

22:24.430 --> 22:25.300
- Or...

22:26.562 --> 22:27.824
Something else.

22:31.306 --> 22:34.004
I think it's time we head back.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.049
- All right.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.273
So he spit on me,

22:42.317 --> 22:44.319
and he was trying to ask me
where we were staying at.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.409
- Did you tell him?
- Fuck no, I just left.

22:47.453 --> 22:51.500
- There's gotta be matches
around here somewhere.

22:55.156 --> 22:58.072
Jake, check this out.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.204
- Whoa, buddy. Put that back.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.989
- Oh, all right. Okay.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.425
Oh, hey.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.339
Found 'em.

23:05.688 --> 23:10.693
Let's get this fire
started, huh?

23:25.099 --> 23:25.926
Oh, man.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.234
You know, it's
really interesting.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.019
Babe, I was just telling you
about this the other day.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.544
Do you remember? Do you
remember what I said?

23:35.588 --> 23:38.329
Okay, well, so, correct
me if I'm wrong,

23:38.373 --> 23:42.508
but most people think that
Canadian beer is much stronger

23:42.551 --> 23:44.074
than American beer, right?

23:44.118 --> 23:47.904
But that's actually false,
so, in Canadia

23:47.948 --> 23:50.951
they use the
alcohol-by-volume method,

23:50.994 --> 23:55.085
but in America, we used to use
the alcohol-by-weight method.

23:55.129 --> 23:59.220
So, just a cool little
tidbit for you guys.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.657
- God, I can't do shit
without the internet.

24:01.701 --> 24:06.140
Can I have your keys? I
have to make a work call.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.098
- You hurt her...

24:08.142 --> 24:09.012
I swear to god.

24:09.056 --> 24:09.970
- Oh, babe, I'll come with you.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.580
- No, it's okay.

24:11.624 --> 24:15.105
It's just a work call, so it's
gonna be like super boring.

24:15.149 --> 24:17.804
So why don't you just stay
and get to know everyone,

24:17.847 --> 24:18.935
and I'll back.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.763
Sorry, babe.
- Yeah, okay.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.684
- I'm gonna go shower.

24:28.728 --> 24:32.906
- Oh, sure. Get
clean.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.215
- Yeah, I'm gonna hit the sack.

24:42.742 --> 24:45.309
- Hey, Professor, are
you not weary that

24:45.353 --> 24:47.834
not one of these guys believe
in anything that we say?

24:47.877 --> 24:51.881
- As long as we're
able to dismantle
people's basic inherent

24:51.925 --> 24:56.320
fear of the unknown, even if
it's something as fantastical

24:56.364 --> 24:59.976
or any
other cryptid for that matter.

25:00.020 --> 25:04.981
You know, it just means
the world to us, as humans.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.549
- Hey, cheers to that, right?

25:13.076 --> 25:16.645
Hey, um, I know we talked
about this earlier, but,

25:16.689 --> 25:20.214
are you at all worried about
the possibility of, you know,

25:20.257 --> 25:21.868
other sightings?

25:21.911 --> 25:24.174
I mean, what if there is
something dangerous out there?

25:24.218 --> 25:27.961
- You know, maybe, maybe
a little danger is exactly

25:28.004 --> 25:31.660
what's needed for us
to question everything.

25:33.619 --> 25:37.405
Enough with all that. So, how's
that thesis of yours goin'?

25:37.448 --> 25:40.190
- Oh! Oh, hey, it's
comin'.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.583
I hit a little lag last week

25:41.627 --> 25:43.846
because it was my
girlfriend's birthday.

25:43.890 --> 25:44.717
Yeah.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.895
Listen, Dennis.

25:48.938 --> 25:50.592
I should let you know that, um,

25:50.636 --> 25:52.202
on our hike earlier, we found-

25:52.246 --> 25:54.422
- I, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

25:54.465 --> 25:55.292
Excuse me.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.382
- Oh.

25:58.426 --> 25:59.209
Okay.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.070
- Isabelle.
- Oh, my god.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.855
Professor Kasdan,
you scared me.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.726
I'm so sorry.

26:37.770 --> 26:40.076
Listen, uh, do you mind
if I come with you?

26:40.120 --> 26:42.949
'Cause something
unfortunate has come up.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.428
- Yeah, what happened?

26:44.472 --> 26:47.562
- Well, as it turns out,
it's my wedding anniversary,

26:47.606 --> 26:50.739
and no wonder my wife was
short with me before we left.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.219
I gotta call her.

26:53.655 --> 26:54.482
- Yeah.

26:56.527 --> 26:57.833
Sure.

26:57.877 --> 27:00.053
Yeah. No, just um, hop in.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.664
Thanks.

27:05.667 --> 27:06.929
- All right.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.627
Maybe some reading.

27:14.067 --> 27:14.894
Hmm.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.335
What's this?

27:28.342 --> 27:29.169
Huh.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.867
"Forest Unseen."

27:35.828 --> 27:36.655
Wow.

27:44.750 --> 27:45.576
Creepy.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.452
"The darkness of
the night brings out

27:51.495 --> 27:53.846
the evil that is the wendigo.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.027
But night's end brings the dawn

28:01.070 --> 28:03.986
and with the dawn
comes the light."

28:35.844 --> 28:38.499
- Lilly, I need to go!

28:38.542 --> 28:40.022
- Give me a minute, man!

28:40.066 --> 28:42.111
- Come on! I gotta go pee!

28:42.155 --> 28:45.288
I swear to god, I'm a
quiet pee'er! Let me in.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.507
- Jake, you even try,

28:46.550 --> 28:47.856
you'll be walking out
with a concussion.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.816
Come on.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.893
Fuck off!

29:24.937 --> 29:27.461
Okay.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.654
- Jake, what did
I tell you, man?

30:00.886 --> 30:04.411
- Yeah, I know I suppose I
concentrate on my studies

30:04.454 --> 30:07.936
a bit too much, but you know,
my wife has absolutely no idea

30:07.980 --> 30:09.938
the concept of budget cuts.

30:09.982 --> 30:12.506
I'm the only one supporting us.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.334
Financially, that is.

30:24.997 --> 30:27.434
Have we hit service?

30:27.477 --> 30:28.652
- Who is that?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.177
Who?

30:31.220 --> 30:32.569
- That.

30:40.926 --> 30:41.709
So weird.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.540
I thought I saw something.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.765
- Isabelle.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.158
Are you all right, Isabelle?

31:22.968 --> 31:25.100
- Are you all right?

31:25.144 --> 31:25.971
Professor?

31:32.891 --> 31:33.717
Oh, shit.

32:47.922 --> 32:51.621
- Okay, I'm just
gonna pee outside.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.667
Yeah, all right.

32:53.710 --> 32:58.019
Here we go.

33:08.160 --> 33:08.987
What...

33:13.904 --> 33:14.731
Yeah.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.997
That's why it's here.

33:20.346 --> 33:21.173
Okay.

33:30.791 --> 33:31.618
Um...

33:34.577 --> 33:35.404
Okay.

33:55.990 --> 33:56.773
Um...

33:59.646 --> 34:00.386
Okay?

34:09.569 --> 34:12.528
Oh, my god.

35:26.515 --> 35:29.388
- Oh! Hey there, tourist.

35:29.431 --> 35:33.783
You oughta watch them
showers. They'll get ya.

35:36.830 --> 35:37.831
Oh!

35:37.874 --> 35:38.701
Hey!

35:42.488 --> 35:45.143
Ain't had one of these in years.

35:46.405 --> 35:47.754
They'll kill ya.

35:58.504 --> 36:01.115
You ever hear anyone die before?

36:05.206 --> 36:06.555
I have.

36:09.123 --> 36:13.040
Every fuckin' night I
still hear those screams.

36:14.389 --> 36:17.653
Yeah, like skin's gettin'
ripped off her bones.

36:17.697 --> 36:20.352
You don't forget shit like that.

36:22.876 --> 36:23.877
What's that?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.680
- If I offended you...

36:44.724 --> 36:46.987
- It ain't about that at all!

36:47.030 --> 36:49.032
- Look, you already got
your free fucking peep show!

36:49.076 --> 36:50.643
- Hey, come on now!

36:52.253 --> 36:53.733
It ain't about
that either, okay?

36:53.776 --> 36:56.475
You got your god damn
shirt back on, don't ya?

36:56.518 --> 36:58.041
Hm?

36:58.085 --> 37:00.392
No, you are just my
bait, little lady.

37:00.435 --> 37:01.828
Nothin' personal.

37:06.006 --> 37:10.228
It's Bigfoot, he's out
in these woods.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.664
Now, you can doubt
him all you want.

37:11.707 --> 37:14.536
He don't give two shits
whether you believe in him.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.930
You can rest assured on that.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.238
- I can tell you're
not a bad guy.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.979
No.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.720
No, you're goin'
for somethin' heavy.

37:24.764 --> 37:27.201
I get that, I really do.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.247
Whatever you're
planning on doing to me,

37:29.290 --> 37:32.293
things are gonna be bad for you!

37:32.337 --> 37:35.383
Your fingerprints are
all over my clothes.

37:35.427 --> 37:36.819
Mine are in this truck, I mean,

37:36.863 --> 37:40.301
my DNA's on the
fuckin' cigarette!

37:40.345 --> 37:42.695
- Yeah, I'mma kill him.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.610
Get that fuckin' rock, too.

37:44.653 --> 37:46.699
That's all there is to it.

37:46.742 --> 37:47.569
Now.

37:48.744 --> 37:51.269
If you die in the
process, well...

37:53.314 --> 37:57.449
Shit, so be it. Why don't you
hang onto that DNA for us?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.728
- Izzy, where you been?

38:23.431 --> 38:24.302
Izzy?

38:25.912 --> 38:27.000
Are you okay?

38:28.828 --> 38:30.917
- Hey, you guys seen Dennis?

38:30.960 --> 38:34.964
I realized we gotta change
somethin' in the schedule.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.749
- Izzy, are you okay?

38:37.663 --> 38:38.968
Look at me.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.318
Where is my car?

38:42.711 --> 38:44.322
- I don't remember.

38:48.021 --> 38:51.981
Isabelle, dear, what
happened? What's goin' on?

38:52.025 --> 38:54.157
- I don't remember.
- Okay, what do you remember?

38:54.201 --> 38:56.421
Just, just calm
down. Just, just...

38:56.464 --> 39:00.294
Isabelle, look at me,
sweetie. Where's Dennis?

39:01.861 --> 39:02.688
- He's...

39:03.950 --> 39:04.777
He's dead.

39:08.868 --> 39:11.349
I'm really, I'm really hungry.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.048
Jake, where
are the others?

39:15.091 --> 39:17.050
- I don't fucking know.

39:19.661 --> 39:20.488
Lilly!

39:21.576 --> 39:22.621
Chris!

39:22.664 --> 39:23.665
Dennis!

39:23.709 --> 39:25.101
Hello!

39:25.145 --> 39:28.931
- Guys, where are you?
- Why would they answer that?

39:37.200 --> 39:38.027
Shit.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.423
- Oh, no.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.033
- Help!

39:44.077 --> 39:45.034
Help!

39:47.080 --> 39:47.907
Help!

39:51.214 --> 39:52.694
- One, two, three.

39:53.565 --> 39:54.914
Go, go.

39:59.875 --> 40:00.833
Shit.

40:00.876 --> 40:01.877
- I saw him.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.226
I saw him.

40:07.796 --> 40:08.710
- Told you.

40:26.336 --> 40:28.251
- Guys, this is all my fault.

40:28.295 --> 40:29.470
I knew it was the Dead Month

40:29.514 --> 40:31.037
and I still insisted
that we come here.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.387
- Did you guys bring any
other way of communication?

40:33.431 --> 40:34.736
- We actually thought
it'd be a good thing

40:34.780 --> 40:36.782
not to have service.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.437
Less distractions for everyone.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.264
God, I'm such an idiot!

40:41.308 --> 40:43.092
- Okay, okay.

40:44.529 --> 40:45.486
Where's the gun?

40:45.530 --> 40:46.922
- Oh, I must've dropped it,

40:46.966 --> 40:48.750
while I was getting
dragged through the woods.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.752
- All right, all right.
Let's just think, all right?

40:50.796 --> 40:53.668
So, the shop was the last place
that we had service, right?

40:53.712 --> 40:56.628
Now how far was that?
- About an hour's drive.

40:56.671 --> 40:59.108
And if they had such a bad
accident that Isabelle left

40:59.152 --> 41:01.459
my car there, then I doubt
it's still fuckin' drivable.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.461
- Okay, we can walk
until we hit service.

41:03.504 --> 41:04.940
- What?

41:04.984 --> 41:07.377
That's a terrible idea.
That thing almost killed me.

41:07.421 --> 41:11.207
- Trust me, Chris. If it wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead.

41:11.251 --> 41:14.472
It was trying to warn you.
- Warn me? About what?

41:14.515 --> 41:15.951
- Spirit of the flesh.

41:19.346 --> 41:20.956
- What'd she say?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.262
- Wait.

41:22.305 --> 41:23.524
Wait, you guys.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.178
I found this book.

41:25.221 --> 41:29.008
It talks about all kinds of
crazy shit like creatures.

41:29.051 --> 41:30.444
- Right.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.489
Bigfoot.
- No.

41:32.751 --> 41:33.752
The wendigo.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.452
It's this creature that-

41:38.496 --> 41:41.499
- Cannibalistic beast
that preys on the selfish.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.370
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know.

41:45.546 --> 41:48.331
- "The wendigo turns
those overcome with greed

41:48.375 --> 41:51.857
into the embodiment
of their weak morals."

41:59.473 --> 42:01.736
- That's the spirit.

42:01.780 --> 42:04.130
It's what gets in your head.

42:10.702 --> 42:15.184
And that's what you become
once the spirit finds you.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.363
He knew.

42:22.278 --> 42:24.367
I brought up the wendigo
sightings to Dennis,

42:24.411 --> 42:26.935
before we even started
planning this trip.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.676
He told me the claims
were phony, but,

42:28.720 --> 42:30.635
he was more worried about
losing his department.

42:30.678 --> 42:34.029
He knew the wendigo was
out there this entire time.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.640
God damn it!

42:35.683 --> 42:37.380
All right, listen. We need
to get the hell outta here.

42:37.424 --> 42:39.600
Right now.
- Wait, hold on.

42:39.644 --> 42:42.385
You're telling me that Bigfoot

42:42.429 --> 42:44.692
isn't the only
monster out there?

42:44.736 --> 42:46.912
- Yes, and it's pure evil.

42:48.043 --> 42:49.697
The torment it inflicts
on those its chooses

42:49.741 --> 42:54.484
is beyond anything you can
imagine, and if it finds us...

42:57.096 --> 42:58.924
We're better off dead.

43:07.715 --> 43:08.586
- Isabelle?

43:14.330 --> 43:16.158
- It knows we're here.

43:18.334 --> 43:22.643
They're coming.

43:25.907 --> 43:27.474
- Tree.

43:29.650 --> 43:30.608
Turn around.

43:32.740 --> 43:33.611
Now...

43:34.786 --> 43:36.614
I'mma tell
you somethin'.

43:36.657 --> 43:38.920
- Get the fuck off me.

43:38.964 --> 43:42.489
- Now, I don't want it to be
all bad blood between us, okay?

43:42.532 --> 43:44.534
This isn't my intention.

43:46.145 --> 43:50.889
I'm Everett Dylan Grunn and
I'm sorry what's happened here.

43:52.107 --> 43:52.978
Ow!

43:53.021 --> 43:54.153
You stupid bitch.

43:54.196 --> 43:55.241
Get back here!
- No!

43:55.284 --> 43:56.459
- Come back here!
- No!

43:56.503 --> 43:57.504
God!

43:57.547 --> 43:58.723
- That's it.
- Fuck you!

43:58.766 --> 44:00.638
- Get against the
tree. You stay still!

44:00.681 --> 44:01.769
Stay still!

44:01.813 --> 44:03.728
Give me your fuckin' hands.

44:03.771 --> 44:04.946
Jesus, here I was thinking

44:04.990 --> 44:08.167
I was only fighting
a Squatch tonight.

44:09.429 --> 44:10.256
Now...

44:12.519 --> 44:15.304
You keep
up that squealin',

44:15.348 --> 44:18.830
and that Bigfoot will be
here before you know it.

44:26.185 --> 44:27.708
God damn.

44:27.752 --> 44:30.319
- Fuckin' psycho
asshole motherfucker!

44:30.363 --> 44:31.190
- Woo-oo!

44:32.017 --> 44:33.540
Let me hide first.

44:48.773 --> 44:49.599
- Help!

46:19.167 --> 46:21.256
I couldn't
find any results for,

46:21.300 --> 46:25.870
"Kill and consume the blood
and flesh of the others."

48:03.184 --> 48:07.014
shoot you down

48:10.539 --> 48:14.630
shoot you down

48:18.634 --> 48:20.941
- That's one stubborn bitch.

51:34.265 --> 51:37.137
- All right, all right, maybe
Lilly found the crashed car

51:37.181 --> 51:39.096
and walked into town for help.

51:39.139 --> 51:41.663
- And walks 60 miles into town?

51:44.492 --> 51:47.147
- Maybe a driver picked
her up or, or maybe...

51:52.500 --> 51:53.284
Isabelle?

52:25.707 --> 52:28.362
Jake!

52:28.406 --> 52:29.494
- Oz.

52:32.105 --> 52:35.543
I don't know what's
happening.

52:35.587 --> 52:36.544
- Oh, shit.

52:39.243 --> 52:41.984
Okay, okay, just stay right
there. Please just don't move.

52:48.339 --> 52:49.601
Isabelle, I'm serious,
please! Just stay right there.

52:49.644 --> 52:50.732
Don't move!

52:56.869 --> 52:58.262
Please, please, please
don't make me do this.

52:58.305 --> 52:59.828
Please don't make me do
this. Don't make me do this!

52:59.872 --> 53:00.960
Oh, god!
- No! No, please don't!

53:01.003 --> 53:03.528
No, please don't!
Please don't hurt me.

53:07.401 --> 53:08.620
- Come on.
- Please don't hurt-

53:08.663 --> 53:10.448
- No, no, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

53:10.491 --> 53:12.058
No, no. Shh, shh, shh.

53:12.101 --> 53:14.408
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

53:14.452 --> 53:17.194
We can fix this, I can fix this.

53:17.237 --> 53:19.196
We're gonna figure it out.

53:19.239 --> 53:20.588
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

53:20.632 --> 53:23.069
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

53:23.112 --> 53:25.941
I'm gonna go find Chris
and, and we'll fix it.

53:25.985 --> 53:28.466
We'll get something
together, okay? Just, just...

53:33.732 --> 53:35.081
- I'm so hungry.

53:45.309 --> 53:46.614
Hello?

54:17.776 --> 54:20.082
- We need to go, now.

54:44.716 --> 54:46.065
- What the fuck?

54:50.765 --> 54:51.810
- Hi, Jake.

54:56.031 --> 54:57.729
I can't find Isabelle.

54:57.772 --> 55:01.298
- The other ones are coming,
alright? We are going.

55:01.341 --> 55:02.168
- Jesus.

55:03.387 --> 55:04.518
You know what?

55:04.562 --> 55:05.998
I just got here and
it seems like I care

55:06.041 --> 55:07.347
so much more about the
others than you do.

55:07.391 --> 55:08.870
You don't give a shit
if they live or die.

55:08.914 --> 55:10.437
- Dude, they would do
the same exact thing.

55:10.481 --> 55:11.699
- Isabelle wouldn't.

55:11.743 --> 55:14.136
- Chris, we don't
have time for this.

55:14.180 --> 55:16.878
Look, you can think I'm
an asshole all you want,

55:16.922 --> 55:19.054
but the truth is, I
live in fuckin' reality.

55:19.098 --> 55:20.969
Look, it's great
you got this whole puppy dog

55:21.013 --> 55:23.624
thing going on, really,
it's seriously endearing,

55:23.668 --> 55:25.496
but you're a fuckin'
pushover, Chris.

55:25.539 --> 55:28.542
You
sacrificing yourself
here doesn't change that

55:28.586 --> 55:30.588
it just makes you a dumb ass.

55:30.631 --> 55:33.330
- Let me check the
rest of the house.

55:33.373 --> 55:34.200
Please.

55:39.510 --> 55:41.207
- Five more minutes.

55:41.250 --> 55:45.254
Then I'm gone, whether
you come or not.

55:45.298 --> 55:46.778
- You're right.

55:46.821 --> 55:49.258
I do think you're an asshole.

55:52.566 --> 55:53.741
- God damn it.

56:28.733 --> 56:29.908
- Hi, babe.

56:52.017 --> 56:57.022
- Fuck.

56:58.545 --> 57:02.157
- Lilly?

57:06.510 --> 57:08.425
They're inside.

58:33.379 --> 58:35.599
Now are you ready to leave?

59:53.285 --> 59:55.200
Run!

1:01:37.911 --> 1:01:38.869
- Let's go.

1:01:40.871 --> 1:01:42.350
So here's the plan.

1:01:42.394 --> 1:01:44.744
We find the creeper that
kidnapped me, grab his keys,

1:01:44.788 --> 1:01:48.356
get to his car and get
the fuck outta here.

1:01:51.229 --> 1:01:52.926
What the fuck are these things?

1:01:52.970 --> 1:01:54.362
- I don't know.

1:01:54.406 --> 1:01:55.581
I don't know, it's whatever's
happening to Isabelle.

1:01:55.624 --> 1:01:57.104
- What's happening to Isabelle?

1:01:57.148 --> 1:02:01.021
- I'm not sure, I think
it's called a wendigo.

1:02:03.937 --> 1:02:05.156
Hey.

1:02:05.199 --> 1:02:06.331
- What?

1:02:06.374 --> 1:02:08.725
- Thanks for not leaving me.

1:02:15.470 --> 1:02:17.037
Do you hear that?

1:02:17.081 --> 1:02:18.299
What?

1:02:21.781 --> 1:02:22.826
- Lilly?

1:02:22.869 --> 1:02:24.262
Where
the fuck are they?

1:02:24.305 --> 1:02:26.090
- Lilly, we have to go.
- Not until I find the keys.

1:02:26.133 --> 1:02:28.179
- Lilly, right now.

1:02:28.222 --> 1:02:29.049
- Got 'em.

1:02:33.967 --> 1:02:34.794
- Come on.

1:02:36.361 --> 1:02:37.188
Come on.

1:04:08.279 --> 1:04:09.802
What the...

1:04:15.503 --> 1:04:18.550
Lilly! Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

1:04:18.593 --> 1:04:22.554
Look at me. It's okay.

1:04:23.947 --> 1:04:27.689
Hey, Lilly? It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

1:04:27.733 --> 1:04:29.387
Lilly, stay with me. Come on.

1:04:29.430 --> 1:04:31.389
Baby, please. Please.

1:04:31.432 --> 1:04:32.694
Please, please.

1:04:33.565 --> 1:04:35.219
Lilly. Lilly, Lilly.

1:04:37.134 --> 1:04:37.961
Lilly?

1:08:45.817 --> 1:08:47.210
Oh, shit.

1:09:02.181 --> 1:09:04.618
Come on, come on, come on, come
on. Just do it, just drive.

1:09:04.662 --> 1:09:06.794
Just drive, please. Come on.

1:09:06.838 --> 1:09:08.405
- They would do the
same exact thing.

1:09:08.448 --> 1:09:10.537
- Isabelle wouldn't.
- Sorry, babe.

1:09:10.581 --> 1:09:11.799
Sorry, babe.

1:09:11.843 --> 1:09:14.759
- You're a fuckin'
pushover, Chris.

1:09:18.545 --> 1:09:19.851
Hi, babe.

1:10:00.370 --> 1:10:03.677
I feel like you're
pushing you away, Chris.

1:10:03.721 --> 1:10:05.462
- No, please. Please.

1:10:23.306 --> 1:10:24.132
Shit.

1:10:45.632 --> 1:10:47.068
Oh, shit. Fuck, fuck!

1:10:51.508 --> 1:10:52.291
Oh, Jesus.

1:10:55.381 --> 1:10:57.601
I hate your fucking khakis.

1:11:06.523 --> 1:11:07.350
Fuck.

1:12:45.839 --> 1:12:47.406
- Jesus Christ.

1:13:01.507 --> 1:13:02.378
Okay.

1:13:25.749 --> 1:13:29.840
chase you down

1:13:32.277 --> 1:13:33.278
You do this?

1:13:37.717 --> 1:13:39.327
Mr. Monster Killer!

1:13:40.981 --> 1:13:43.462
My name is Everett Dylan Grunn,

1:13:44.811 --> 1:13:46.117
and I don't know you...

1:13:52.079 --> 1:13:54.081
It don't matter anymore.

1:13:56.693 --> 1:14:00.610
I used to come to this place
every fuckin' year for a month.

1:14:00.653 --> 1:14:03.743
Every single year,
every single...

1:14:09.532 --> 1:14:13.449
I thought it was about
Bigfoot, and the girl.

1:14:15.015 --> 1:14:15.842
Gee!

1:14:18.454 --> 1:14:22.283
I always did kinda lie
to myself about that.

1:14:22.327 --> 1:14:24.111
Wasn't about no girl.

1:14:24.938 --> 1:14:26.592
Or even the Squatch.

1:14:28.246 --> 1:14:30.335
It about this here goddamn rock.

1:14:33.033 --> 1:14:34.078
I don't know what...

1:14:36.602 --> 1:14:37.995
A test.

1:14:38.038 --> 1:14:39.823
This spirit of flesh.

1:14:43.174 --> 1:14:44.001
Wendigo.

1:14:45.524 --> 1:14:49.615
That wendigo, he knows
me inside and out.

1:14:49.659 --> 1:14:51.356
He got into my head,

1:14:52.488 --> 1:14:54.577
and squeezed his way in there.

1:14:54.620 --> 1:14:56.492
He made me do things...

1:15:00.191 --> 1:15:01.540
I ain't proud of.

1:15:04.369 --> 1:15:08.329
That don't matter none now.

1:15:08.373 --> 1:15:10.506
Neither does this here rock.

1:15:11.942 --> 1:15:13.552
'Cause the only
fuckin' thing I know

1:15:13.596 --> 1:15:15.859
is how goddamn hungry I am.

1:15:16.686 --> 1:15:19.166
I'm just tickled pink,

1:15:19.210 --> 1:15:24.215
thinkin' about sinkin' my teeth
in that pretty leg of yours.

1:15:41.275 --> 1:15:43.408
shoot you down

1:15:47.543 --> 1:15:49.196
You better run.

1:16:08.128 --> 1:16:09.434
- I'm so tired.

1:16:24.971 --> 1:16:29.062
shoot you down

1:18:18.606 --> 1:18:20.173
- Dead Month?

1:18:36.842 --> 1:18:41.847
you were talking to me

1:18:43.762 --> 1:18:48.724

1:19:08.439 --> 1:19:12.095

1:20:07.672 --> 1:20:11.241

1:20:11.284 --> 1:20:14.940
