00:46.316 --> 00:50.083
At last! The first day
of school has come!

01:07.316 --> 01:08.466
Hello, Dexter.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.300
Hello, Mrs. Wolfberg.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.100
Hey, Dexter.

01:12.133 --> 01:13.016
Hello.

01:13.050 --> 01:14.083
Man: Welcome back,
Dexter.

01:14.116 --> 01:17.033
Woman: Good to have you
back, Dexter.

01:17.266 --> 01:20.050
Teacher: Well, class,
welcome to the new year.

01:20.083 --> 01:23.116
So, let's get
right into it. Uh, yes?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.216
The answer is hydrogen.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.483
Teacher: Uh, why, yes,
that is the correct answer

01:28.016 --> 01:29.200
to the question
I was about to ask.

01:29.233 --> 01:33.083
Oh, I almost forgot.
I wanted to introduce
our new student.

01:33.116 --> 01:34.466
Will you come up here,
please, son?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.033
Class, say hello
to Mr. Astronominoff.

01:39.066 --> 01:43.016
Please, sir,
call me mandark.

[Ruff ruff]

01:44.250 --> 01:46.000
[Neigh]

01:46.266 --> 01:47.283
Excuse me, sir,

01:47.316 --> 01:49.116
but may I please
relocate myself

01:49.150 --> 01:50.433
to a closer location
to the board

01:50.466 --> 01:52.433
so I can achieve
the optimum effect

01:52.466 --> 01:54.050
of your education?

01:54.083 --> 01:56.066
Uh, go ahead, mandark.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.416
This location
will be quite adequate.

01:59.450 --> 02:03.133
Yes, Dexter,
i<i>ca</i>
your thoughts,

02:03.166 --> 02:06.066
and I am smarter
than you.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.483
This is your principal.

02:08.016 --> 02:10.200
Welcome to the new year,
students.

02:10.233 --> 02:12.183
Let the studies begin!

02:12.216 --> 02:13.200
Write an essay

02:13.233 --> 02:14.466
on what you did
this summer vacation.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Finished.

02:17.233 --> 02:18.216
Done.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.333
Teacher: Who wrote
the bill of rights?

02:20.366 --> 02:21.316
Thomas Jefferson.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.083
What is the name
of Neptune's moon?

02:24.116 --> 02:25.016
Triton.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.316
What kind
of triangle has--

02:26.350 --> 02:27.316
isosceles.

02:27.350 --> 02:28.216
Dasyurid.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.266
The medulla oblongata.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.100
That's incredible.

02:31.133 --> 02:34.116
No!

02:35.083 --> 02:37.433
I am sorry, my mentor.

02:37.466 --> 02:40.100
I have failed you.

02:40.133 --> 02:43.116
[Crying]

02:44.333 --> 02:45.433
Hey, Dexter.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.450
Huh?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.183
Some kid told me
you have a laboratory.

02:48.216 --> 02:49.383
A laboratory?

02:49.416 --> 02:53.166
Dexter, your lab--
it is the one thing
he does not have,

02:53.200 --> 02:55.183
and it will
still make you

02:55.216 --> 02:57.150
the smartest one
of all.

02:57.183 --> 03:00.383
Go ahead.
Show him your lab.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.266
Welcome,
and be amazed

03:02.300 --> 03:07.083
at the world
of Dexter's
laboratory.

03:07.116 --> 03:08.116
[Yawn]

03:08.150 --> 03:09.316
Very cute, Dexter.
Very cute.

03:09.350 --> 03:13.416
Now let me show you
a<i>rea</i>
facility.

03:13.450 --> 03:15.233

03:15.450 --> 03:18.483
Welcome to my laboratory!

03:19.016 --> 03:20.150
[Echo]
Laboratory!

03:20.183 --> 03:21.250
Laboratory!

03:21.283 --> 03:24.150
As you can
plainly see,
Dexter,

03:24.183 --> 03:25.433
this facility
accommodates

03:25.466 --> 03:28.483
every aspect of science
known to man.

03:29.016 --> 03:30.066
Thank you.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.150
So for you to continue
to waste precious energy

03:32.183 --> 03:35.083
with your little lab
would be scientifically
unsound.

03:35.116 --> 03:37.400
And so I leave you
with 2 choices:

03:37.433 --> 03:39.366
Either you
become my lackey

03:39.400 --> 03:40.483
or shut down your lab

03:41.016 --> 03:43.233
and discontinue any further
experiments hereon in.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.250
The choice is yours.

03:45.283 --> 03:48.133
Good-bye, Dexter.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.000
Computer:
Dexter--

03:57.033 --> 03:59.433
what are you
doing, Dexter?

03:59.466 --> 04:01.250
Good-bye, my love.

04:01.283 --> 04:05.350
[Slurred]
Good-bye,
Dexter.

04:05.383 --> 04:08.066
No!

04:08.100 --> 04:11.333
[Crying]

04:11.366 --> 04:16.000
Sir, we're reading
a complete shutdown
from Dexter's lab.

04:16.033 --> 04:19.116
Our power levels are
at optimum efficiency.

04:19.150 --> 04:22.366
Excellent. Ha ha!
Excellent.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.100
Ha ha ha!

04:26.350 --> 04:30.116
[Crying]

04:32.183 --> 04:33.416
[Ring]

04:38.233 --> 04:40.350
Oh, hello, Mr. Levinsky.

04:40.383 --> 04:42.333
Hmm.

04:43.066 --> 04:44.483
Mrs. Cartwright.

04:45.016 --> 04:45.433
Hmm.

04:45.466 --> 04:47.366
Mrs. Wolfberg?

04:47.400 --> 04:49.466
Hmm.

04:50.316 --> 04:53.183
Look! There he is.

04:53.216 --> 04:58.016
[Excited chatter]

05:00.333 --> 05:01.233
Hi, Dexter!

05:01.266 --> 05:03.000
[Echo]
Hi, Dexter!

05:03.033 --> 05:05.016
Hi, Dexter!

05:06.033 --> 05:10.216
[Love song playing]

05:12.000 --> 05:13.383
Ohh...

05:21.116 --> 05:23.316
Ohh...

05:24.100 --> 05:25.450
Dexter!

05:25.483 --> 05:27.250
What do you want?

05:27.283 --> 05:29.133
Who is that?

05:30.333 --> 05:31.416
Oh, that's just

05:31.450 --> 05:33.366
my stupid sister Dee Dee.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.483
Dee Dee.

05:36.016 --> 05:37.050
Oh, what
a heavenly name

05:37.083 --> 05:39.200
the eternals
have blessed
her with!

05:39.233 --> 05:40.483
Oh, Dexter, Dexter,
please, please,

05:41.016 --> 05:43.183
set me up on a date
with that golden-haired
angel who graces

05:43.216 --> 05:46.016
our undeserving school
with her infinite
beauty.

05:46.050 --> 05:47.050
No way.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.166
You don't owe
that jerk
any favors.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.166
That's right!

05:50.200 --> 05:52.050
He made you
shut down
your lab.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.100
He's right.

05:53.133 --> 05:54.050
Yeah.

05:54.083 --> 05:54.450
And besides,

05:54.483 --> 05:55.483
Dee Dee's hyper and clumsy,

05:56.016 --> 05:57.266
and she would probably wreck

05:57.300 --> 05:59.116
mandark's labo--

06:00.350 --> 06:02.483
there, there,
old palsey.

06:03.016 --> 06:04.283
I'll fix you up.

06:04.316 --> 06:05.333
You will?

06:05.366 --> 06:08.300
Sure. All you
have to do is...

06:08.333 --> 06:10.016
[Whispers]

06:10.050 --> 06:12.333
[Knock knock]

06:12.366 --> 06:14.200
Hello.

06:14.233 --> 06:18.016
Ooh...candy!

06:21.166 --> 06:23.083
There is more candy
upstairs

06:23.116 --> 06:26.083
if you desire,
my love.

06:26.116 --> 06:27.350
Hmm...

06:27.383 --> 06:29.300
Ok.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.400
Here you are,
my dear.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.183
Yum-yum.

06:35.216 --> 06:37.083
So, Dee Dee, I heard

06:37.116 --> 06:39.283
from a very
reliable source

06:39.316 --> 06:41.333
that you...

06:41.366 --> 06:42.350
Like...

06:42.383 --> 06:43.350
To...

06:43.383 --> 06:45.100
Dance.

06:45.133 --> 06:47.000
Dance?
I'd love to!

06:47.033 --> 06:51.016
Mandark: Aah!

06:52.233 --> 06:54.066
Robots, help!

07:02.100 --> 07:05.150
Ahh...

07:06.000 --> 07:08.316
A toast to my sweet
sister Dee Dee

07:08.350 --> 07:12.200
for reuniting me
with<i>my</i>

computer: It's good
to be back, Dexter.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.100
[Clink]

07:24.233 --> 07:26.216
Dexter: After countless
experiments,

07:26.250 --> 07:28.366
all testing proves negative.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.483
No enhanced abilities,
no physical mutations,

07:33.016 --> 07:34.250
no nothing!

07:34.283 --> 07:39.300
It seems you shall never
become anything more
than a mere monkey.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.200
Monkey, this is
agent honeydew.

07:42.233 --> 07:44.233
Help us.

08:04.383 --> 08:10.066
Oh, monkey, monkey,
earth's in trouble.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.150
We need your help.

08:11.183 --> 08:15.316
Hear my thoughts.
Help us, monkey!

08:15.350 --> 08:17.200
[Ding]

08:23.400 --> 08:25.316
Thank the stars!

08:25.350 --> 08:28.250
We knew you'd
come through, monkey.

08:28.283 --> 08:30.366
You always do.

08:31.033 --> 08:34.316
Greetings, everyone.
As you were.

08:34.350 --> 08:36.166
Monkey, I can't
thank you enough

08:36.200 --> 08:39.083
for your speedy rescue
of agent honeydew and crew.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.133
However, we have
a much larger problem

08:41.166 --> 08:42.183
on our hands.
Honeydew.

08:42.216 --> 08:44.216
As we entered sector 12
on routine patrol,

08:44.250 --> 08:47.433
an armada
of unknown warships
dropped out of warp

08:47.466 --> 08:49.350
directly on top of us.

08:49.383 --> 08:51.166
We never had a chance.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.383
We know nothing
of this deadly fleet

08:53.416 --> 08:55.133
except for its trajectory--

08:55.166 --> 08:56.166
planet earth.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.216
We're desperate.

08:57.250 --> 09:00.016
Monkey, can
you help us?

09:00.050 --> 09:02.366
[Eek eek eek]

09:08.016 --> 09:09.266
[Eek]

09:13.116 --> 09:14.433
He's strong.

09:14.466 --> 09:19.400
He's falling
into my trap
as I had planned.

09:30.133 --> 09:32.100
Please come in.

09:32.133 --> 09:35.366
Take your shoes off.
Stay awhile.

09:36.433 --> 09:40.183
That was quite a show
you put on out there,
monkey.

09:40.216 --> 09:42.383
But as we speak,
my space station

09:42.416 --> 09:48.450
is set to destroy
your planet earth
in 5 minutes.

09:48.483 --> 09:49.416
[Eek]

09:49.450 --> 09:53.133
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

09:53.166 --> 09:56.216
Brute force
will get you
nowhere.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.333
I'm a man of class.
Behold my succulent feast--

09:59.366 --> 10:05.216
king crab, swordfish,
scalloped potatoes.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.250
But of course,
if this is
too rich for you,

10:08.283 --> 10:13.316
I'll have my cooks
make you a banana split.

10:15.016 --> 10:17.350
Ha ha ha!

10:17.383 --> 10:19.050
Ha ha ha!

10:19.083 --> 10:21.350
[Eek eek]

10:22.233 --> 10:25.100
No! I am<i>not</i>

I am simion!

10:30.133 --> 10:32.083
[Eek eek]

10:32.233 --> 10:35.050
What is my problem
with man, you ask?

10:35.083 --> 10:43.033
No. I ask you,
what was man's
problem with<i>me?</i>

10:44.300 --> 10:48.450
I deserve revenge
for what they did to me.

10:48.483 --> 10:52.116
The pain...

10:52.150 --> 10:55.366
The horror.

10:58.333 --> 11:02.383
I was to be
the first monkey
in space.

11:02.416 --> 11:04.450
The mission
was disastrous.

11:04.483 --> 11:08.066
A crack
in the ship's hull
created an explosion

11:08.100 --> 11:11.150
that hurled me
into a radioactive
energy belt.

11:11.183 --> 11:14.450
I was exposed
to gamma rays

11:14.483 --> 11:16.250
and changed
for life.

11:16.283 --> 11:20.200
I became strong
and amazingly
intelligent.

11:20.233 --> 11:24.233
Yes. I began
to build
a<i>ne</i>

11:24.266 --> 11:28.233
I expanded my knowledge
and skill by meditation.

11:28.266 --> 11:34.016
Soon I could
create matter
merely by thought.

11:34.050 --> 11:35.233
In half a century,

11:35.266 --> 11:39.216
I built this entire
space station from scratch.

11:39.250 --> 11:42.116
Now the time
has finally come

11:42.150 --> 11:44.333
for my revenge
on the hairless apes

11:44.366 --> 11:47.466
for making a Guinea pig
out of me.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.100
Like you, monkey--

11:49.133 --> 11:51.316
while you put your neck
on the line,

11:51.350 --> 11:54.333
the humans sit
comfortably, getting fat.

11:54.366 --> 11:57.100
That is why
I brought you here.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.183
Your presence is strong.

11:58.216 --> 12:01.300
Together we could combine
our forces and bring

12:01.333 --> 12:04.316
a new order to the galaxy.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.000
Seek your heart.

Oh, I never thought
all the answers
would be given to me

13:01.200 --> 13:03.066
in such a simple package.

13:03.100 --> 13:08.183
How could I not see
that I have become
that which I hate?

13:08.216 --> 13:12.033
Only a monkey
could show me that.

13:12.066 --> 13:16.016
Oh, my friend,
I want to walk like you,

13:16.050 --> 13:17.066
talk like you.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.316
