00:02.068 --> 00:03.370
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:03.400 --> 00:05.204
- Hello, Nik.
- Rebekah.

00:05.234 --> 00:06.955
- You know who I am.
- Freya.

00:06.986 --> 00:09.158
Tell our brothers I'll be
coming to see them soon.

00:09.188 --> 00:11.955
Do you renounce your Alpha status?

00:14.048 --> 00:16.209
(Hayley): These attacks,
they're only gonna get worse.

00:16.210 --> 00:18.651
We need to get married
as soon as possible.

00:18.681 --> 00:21.145
I curse you to this body,

00:21.175 --> 00:23.633
a meaningless, lonely death.

00:23.635 --> 00:25.052
- Niklaus.
- Finn knows

00:25.082 --> 00:26.575
about Hope, about everything.

00:26.605 --> 00:28.654
He is on his way.

00:30.290 --> 00:31.829
(Gas hissing)

00:36.113 --> 00:39.949
(Elijah): Gas has pervaded
every single room in this home.

00:39.951 --> 00:41.556
Good-bye, brother.

00:47.224 --> 00:50.932
(Hope crying)

00:54.071 --> 00:55.604
It's ok, sweet girl.

00:55.634 --> 00:57.627
I just need to find a pay phone.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.387
Damn it!

01:17.389 --> 01:19.868
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19.898 --> 01:20.919
You're being so brave.

01:20.949 --> 01:24.268
- The least I could do is watch my...
- (Scuffling)

01:25.663 --> 01:27.870
Whoever's out there, if you try anything,

01:27.900 --> 01:30.417
I will gouge out your eyes!

01:31.320 --> 01:33.841
Actually, Camille, it's
probably not necessary.

01:33.871 --> 01:35.404
What the hell happened back there?

01:35.406 --> 01:36.906
That's a discussion for the car.

01:36.908 --> 01:39.097
Let's move.

01:39.558 --> 01:43.523
== sync & corrections by wolfen
== ... www.addic7ed.com ...

01:45.296 --> 01:47.794
- What do you think you're doing?
- Elijah said they're on the road,

01:47.824 --> 01:49.886
so I'm gonna go to them
and get my daughter.

01:49.888 --> 01:52.560
Do not tell me that it's not safe.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.911
I'll tell you what's not safe...

01:53.941 --> 01:56.473
Blowing up a house just to keep
your evil brother from finding her.

01:56.503 --> 01:57.720
We will deal with Finn.

01:57.750 --> 01:58.899
And then what?

01:58.929 --> 02:00.329
Every time you kill him,

02:00.359 --> 02:01.736
he's just gonna jump into another body.

02:01.766 --> 02:03.299
We tried running, we tried hiding.

02:03.301 --> 02:04.405
Neither will work.

02:04.435 --> 02:05.307
So what's your bright idea?

02:05.337 --> 02:06.638
As it happens, I'm working on a plan

02:06.668 --> 02:08.710
as we speak, one which
will be bolstered greatly

02:08.740 --> 02:09.973
if you just calm down

02:10.003 --> 02:11.079
- and keep your eye on the prize.
- Do not

02:11.109 --> 02:12.631
manage me. I have every right...

02:12.661 --> 02:14.198
Hayley, you're getting married today,

02:14.228 --> 02:15.900
an act which will seal the loyalty

02:15.930 --> 02:18.798
of all the wolves that answer to Finn.

02:19.324 --> 02:22.606
You will be queen to an army.

02:26.074 --> 02:28.364
And a queen does not run.

02:32.677 --> 02:34.513
Well, you still don't look so good.

02:34.515 --> 02:39.051
Oh, it's worse than the
Halloween hangover of 2011.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.354
I went after Aiden, didn't I?

02:44.957 --> 02:47.264
You know, he was up all
day, all night with you

02:47.294 --> 02:48.827
until Marcel called and said

02:48.829 --> 02:50.708
that the spell was broken.

02:52.674 --> 02:55.288
Well, you guys totally saved my ass.

02:55.318 --> 02:57.419
(Kol): Yeah? Well, don't mention it.

02:57.421 --> 02:59.565
There you go. Here's a little go juice,

02:59.595 --> 03:04.414
so you should be, uh, well, going.

03:04.444 --> 03:06.071
Bye.

03:11.283 --> 03:12.718
So where were you yesterday?

03:12.748 --> 03:14.241
Oh, you know, being a hero,

03:14.271 --> 03:16.037
saving the day, the usual.

03:16.039 --> 03:17.839
Ah. And you didn't think I could help?

03:17.841 --> 03:19.203
Well, you were with your mate.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.309
You can't call me? It takes 10 seconds.

03:21.311 --> 03:25.375
Ooh! This is a right
proper spot we're having.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.037
It's almost as if we're, uh...

03:27.067 --> 03:29.400
Oh, what is that phrase?

03:29.402 --> 03:30.969
Going steady.

03:30.971 --> 03:32.242
You wish.

03:32.272 --> 03:33.872
Well, maybe, and maybe I can

03:33.874 --> 03:35.473
make it up to you

03:35.475 --> 03:37.744
by, uh, oh,

03:38.911 --> 03:40.157
finishing a mystical dagger.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.713
What do you say?

03:43.675 --> 03:46.584
All those alphas dead.

03:46.586 --> 03:50.449
That's a lot of wolves
that are gonna want revenge.

03:50.479 --> 03:52.446
We'll make it clear the
witches were behind this.

03:52.476 --> 03:54.576
The vampires were
manipulated by dark magic.

03:54.578 --> 03:56.472
This wasn't their fault.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.074
(Klaus): Gentlemen.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.434
I come bearing gifts.

04:03.436 --> 04:04.490
What the hell did you do?

04:04.524 --> 04:06.493
I removed the heads of the wolf leaders

04:06.523 --> 04:08.866
who refused to relinquish
Finn's moonlight rings.

04:08.896 --> 04:11.809
You brought me a bag of werewolf heads?

04:11.811 --> 04:13.566
Well, I had hoped you'd see it

04:13.596 --> 04:15.266
as an early wedding present.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.598
Besides, I can't have witch sympathizers

04:17.600 --> 04:18.403
in my army.

04:18.433 --> 04:20.857
The wolves are not now nor will ever be

04:20.887 --> 04:23.121
your army.

04:23.873 --> 04:28.251
You know, you are a brave
and selfless leader, Jackson,

04:29.295 --> 04:31.050
and I'm positive you'll remain so

04:31.080 --> 04:34.181
for the entire duration of your reign.

04:34.456 --> 04:36.951
Festivities begin at 8:00 at my compound.

04:36.953 --> 04:38.385
Spread the word and
do arrive early enough

04:38.387 --> 04:39.409
to clean yourself up.

04:39.439 --> 04:41.789
It's your wedding day for God's sake.

04:46.094 --> 04:47.756
Am I crazy, or did he just do his version

04:47.786 --> 04:49.361
of a nice thing?

05:11.884 --> 05:13.170
(Kol): You ready?

05:13.172 --> 05:14.972
I don't know.

05:15.002 --> 05:16.674
Never done this before, remember?

05:16.676 --> 05:19.165
I've never actually
completed the spell itself,

05:19.195 --> 05:20.606
but then, uh, I've never had

05:20.636 --> 05:23.296
an accomplice quite as powerful as you.

05:26.650 --> 05:28.407
So let's do it then.

05:28.437 --> 05:29.954
Let's do it.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.689
(Davina and Kol chanting)

05:46.321 --> 05:49.022
(Freya): Helbred bransar, belaste herte,

05:49.024 --> 05:51.012
begin panet.

05:51.042 --> 05:53.676
Helbred bransar, belaste herte,

05:53.678 --> 05:55.411
begin panet.

05:55.413 --> 05:58.834
(Chanting)

06:00.784 --> 06:03.786
Helbred bransar, belaste herte,

06:03.788 --> 06:05.355
begin panet.

06:05.357 --> 06:08.191
(Chanting)

06:21.672 --> 06:23.606
I think it worked.

06:35.152 --> 06:37.820
(Freya): Helbred bransar, belaste herte,

06:37.822 --> 06:39.121
begin panet.

06:39.123 --> 06:42.058
Helbred bransar, belaste herte,

06:42.060 --> 06:43.826
begin panet.

06:48.815 --> 06:50.049
Are you ok?

06:50.051 --> 06:52.818
Helbred bransar, belaste herte,

06:52.820 --> 06:53.986
begin panet.

06:53.988 --> 06:57.056
Helbred bransar, belaste herte,

06:57.058 --> 06:58.190
begin panet.

06:58.192 --> 07:00.792
(Gasps)

07:04.883 --> 07:06.827
(Davina): Kol, are you
sure you're all right?

07:12.089 --> 07:14.190
I'm fine.

07:14.192 --> 07:18.395
A spell like that takes
its toll, doesn't it?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.569
And you hide that for now, ok,

07:20.599 --> 07:23.733
because, uh, well, today, we've got

07:23.735 --> 07:25.435
a reason to celebrate.

07:27.104 --> 07:28.772
Come to the wedding with me.

07:28.774 --> 07:31.875
Fine, but if there's music,

07:31.877 --> 07:33.409
we're dancing.

07:45.596 --> 07:49.408
Beks? Beks, it's your brother.

07:51.178 --> 07:53.379
I need a favor.

07:53.381 --> 07:56.310
(Music playing)

08:04.124 --> 08:06.292
All right. Bad news first.

08:06.294 --> 08:08.127
I will have to miss your nuptials.

08:08.129 --> 08:09.428
Kol has a bit of a life-and-death matter

08:09.430 --> 08:10.752
he needs help dealing with.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.582
Anything I can do, Rebekah?

08:12.584 --> 08:15.685
It's witch business, which
now seems to be my thing.

08:15.687 --> 08:18.861
Besides, you have enough to deal with.

08:18.891 --> 08:20.423
On that note...

08:23.527 --> 08:26.208
Now it's white, which won't fool anyone,

08:26.238 --> 08:28.564
but you can't get married in
skinny jeans and combat boots.

08:28.566 --> 08:30.967
Oh, Rebekah.

08:32.419 --> 08:33.936
Thank you.

08:38.775 --> 08:40.121
Oh, it's beautiful.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.610
Well, I happen to be the only woman alive

08:41.611 --> 08:42.878
who's collected wedding dresses

08:42.880 --> 08:44.919
in 5 different centuries.

08:44.949 --> 08:47.049
Never made it down the aisle of course.

08:47.051 --> 08:49.485
Well, you know, it's not too late.

08:49.487 --> 08:53.989
From what I understand,
Marcel is still single.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.993
Have you told him yet that you're... you?

08:57.995 --> 08:59.913
I thought I'd hold off
on that for the moment.

08:59.943 --> 09:01.195
Only complicates matters,

09:01.225 --> 09:05.834
and I'm not exactly sure how
long this is going to last.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.240
Right.

09:08.372 --> 09:10.939
Hayley, I wanted to say

09:10.941 --> 09:13.055
now you may be marrying Jackson Kenner

09:13.085 --> 09:15.477
of the boozy backwater Kenners,

09:15.479 --> 09:17.512
but you're still one of us,

09:17.514 --> 09:20.515
a Mikaelson.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.089
Always will be.

09:22.119 --> 09:24.052
Gosh, that would be
such a nice compliment

09:24.054 --> 09:28.090
if it didn't link me to
so many homicidal lunatics.

09:40.822 --> 09:43.437
Thanks for coming. Look,
I know I owe you a massive...

09:43.467 --> 09:45.865
Apology.

09:46.543 --> 09:48.227
You scared the hell out of me.

09:48.257 --> 09:49.595
I-I know, and I'm sorry.

09:49.597 --> 09:50.835
I just...

09:50.865 --> 09:55.141
Look. Hayley and Jackson
are getting married today.

09:55.171 --> 09:56.929
Quarter's gonna be
packed with wolves, ok,

09:56.959 --> 09:59.538
and after this wedding, our whole pack

09:59.540 --> 10:02.440
will inherit Hayley's
control of her wolf form.

10:02.926 --> 10:04.418
That means wolves will be 
able to turn at will.

10:04.448 --> 10:07.245
We'll be that much more
deadly to vampires, to you.

10:11.217 --> 10:12.978
I think...

10:13.414 --> 10:15.920
We need a timeout.

10:15.922 --> 10:17.455
Whoa, whoa!

10:17.457 --> 10:18.595
I'm sorry. Is this the world's

10:18.625 --> 10:20.513
worst breakup speech?

10:20.543 --> 10:23.011
Because if so, just say it like it is.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.204
You want to call things off because

10:24.234 --> 10:25.869
it would look weird for the werewolf VP

10:25.899 --> 10:27.361
to be dating me.

10:27.391 --> 10:30.101
No. Dating me puts a target on your back.

10:30.103 --> 10:31.536
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

10:31.538 --> 10:32.759
Well, you know what? I can't remember

10:32.789 --> 10:35.056
the last time I was safe.

10:38.111 --> 10:39.494
Josh.

10:42.961 --> 10:45.063
Phew.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.308
Oh, I so do not belong in your world.

10:48.338 --> 10:50.665
My world? Give me some credit.

10:50.695 --> 10:51.923
I'm not exactly the kind of girl

10:51.953 --> 10:54.772
who sat around fantasizing
about her wedding day,

10:54.802 --> 10:57.267
and if I had, it probably would have looked

10:57.297 --> 10:59.981
a little less this.

11:00.011 --> 11:01.415
Yeah.

11:03.187 --> 11:04.519
You getting cold feet?

11:04.521 --> 11:07.060
No. This is what's right

11:07.090 --> 11:10.211
for Hope, for our pack.

11:11.647 --> 11:13.408
Hayley.

11:14.029 --> 11:16.002
If I might intrude, there's someone

11:16.032 --> 11:18.532
who wishes to say hello.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.760
You brought them here?

11:29.762 --> 11:31.295
Finn could be anywhere.

11:31.297 --> 11:32.696
I've taken precautions.

11:32.698 --> 11:34.798
There will be no uninvited
guests at your wedding,

11:34.800 --> 11:36.956
and after, your pack
will be the first line

11:36.986 --> 11:39.086
of defense to this home.

11:39.088 --> 11:42.389
No more running, queen.

11:53.661 --> 11:55.404
Hi.

11:58.424 --> 11:59.823
(Hope giggling)

11:59.825 --> 12:01.638
Hee hee hee!

12:04.259 --> 12:07.297
Hope, this is Jackson.

12:07.299 --> 12:09.299
Jackson...

12:09.541 --> 12:11.935
This is Hope.

12:11.937 --> 12:12.923
Hi.

12:12.953 --> 12:15.111
(Squeals)

12:25.273 --> 12:27.684
I thought your daughter's
return would please you.

12:27.686 --> 12:29.252
I'm overjoyed,

12:29.254 --> 12:31.054
and I'll be even more so

12:31.056 --> 12:34.179
provided you do nothing
to dissuade Hayley

12:34.209 --> 12:36.559
from going through with this wedding.

12:37.712 --> 12:41.381
Is there something you
wish to discuss, Niklaus?

12:41.383 --> 12:44.017
Everybody knows you're in love with her,

12:44.019 --> 12:46.252
but Hayley has a duty to this family,

12:46.254 --> 12:47.475
and so do you.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.629
I was under the impression

12:48.659 --> 12:50.262
this was Hayley's choice.

12:50.292 --> 12:52.538
Tell me you did nothing
to bully this decision.

12:52.568 --> 12:54.128
We're mobilizing an army.

12:54.184 --> 12:56.696
She will do what is asked of her,

12:57.046 --> 12:59.120
and you will do nothing to prevent that.

12:59.150 --> 13:01.484
Unless of course I learn
that she was pressured

13:01.486 --> 13:03.252
into sacrificing her freedom in the name

13:03.254 --> 13:04.654
of some political alliance.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.159
Hayley is putting family first.

13:07.189 --> 13:09.025
I suggest you do the same.

13:09.027 --> 13:11.049
Family is always first.

13:11.079 --> 13:15.048
Well, then we won't have 
a problem, will we?

13:18.686 --> 13:21.187
(Chanting)

13:25.638 --> 13:27.961
Aah!

13:27.963 --> 13:29.195
Calm down.

13:29.197 --> 13:30.296
You need to keep your wits

13:30.298 --> 13:31.864
if you're to beat this.

13:36.202 --> 13:38.083
There is no beating it.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.241
It's latched on like a vice.

13:42.243 --> 13:43.943
So you're giving up.

13:43.945 --> 13:46.091
What happened to the
brother I used to know,

13:46.121 --> 13:48.014
the one who laughed death in the face?

13:48.016 --> 13:52.657
That's a lot easier to do when
you haven't died already once.

13:52.687 --> 13:55.054
I hated it the first time.

13:57.157 --> 14:01.232
The ironic thing is I actually
preferred this go-round,

14:01.262 --> 14:03.929
being a witch.

14:03.931 --> 14:06.699
No heightened emotion,

14:06.701 --> 14:10.291
no bloodlust.

14:12.173 --> 14:14.151
It's just me.

14:17.043 --> 14:19.711
For a while anyway.

14:21.633 --> 14:23.538
Hi.

14:23.568 --> 14:27.521
I still can't believe that you're here.

14:27.553 --> 14:31.630
Ah. Mommy has to go
and do this big thing,

14:31.660 --> 14:32.992
but don't worry.

14:33.022 --> 14:34.861
Miss Cami will watch you,

14:35.413 --> 14:37.529
and after that,

14:37.559 --> 14:39.748
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.915
Ha ha ha!

14:42.815 --> 14:45.464
(Footsteps)

15:02.050 --> 15:04.409
You look perfect.

15:09.428 --> 15:10.979
Hayley, I understand this arrangement is

15:10.981 --> 15:12.581
important to your cause,

15:12.583 --> 15:14.916
and I will do nothing
to dissuade you from it,

15:14.918 --> 15:17.519
but I'd be remiss if I didn't
tell you at least once...

15:17.521 --> 15:18.987
Don't.

15:22.191 --> 15:23.658
Don't say it.

15:25.861 --> 15:29.163
Ever since the first day that I met you,

15:29.165 --> 15:31.532
I have felt

15:31.534 --> 15:35.580
everything for you,

15:36.506 --> 15:39.407
and all this time,

15:39.409 --> 15:44.445
you were never able to say 
how you feel about me,

15:44.447 --> 15:46.236
and I get it.

15:46.266 --> 15:50.101
You can't just be the guy 
who says how he feels.

15:56.869 --> 15:58.937
But Jackson is.

16:01.847 --> 16:05.569
And I think that I can be happy with him,

16:05.599 --> 16:08.686
and I just want to be happy, Elijah.

16:15.160 --> 16:19.142
So whatever you were gonna say to me...

16:19.898 --> 16:22.199
Please don't say it.

16:44.331 --> 16:45.905
(Aiden): Need a hand with that?

16:45.935 --> 16:47.266
No.

16:49.503 --> 16:54.406
Look. I'm sorry Oliver couldn't be here.

16:54.408 --> 16:57.776
Yeah, me, too.

16:57.778 --> 16:59.710
Although I'm sure he'd have a lot to say

16:59.740 --> 17:04.752
about me in this get-up
in a vampire house.

17:04.782 --> 17:09.255
So you really think the wolves
will be cool with the vampires?

17:09.257 --> 17:11.924
And if not, screw them.

17:11.925 --> 17:13.826
I mean, we're done chasing old grudges.

17:13.828 --> 17:16.095
We got real enemies to worry about.

17:23.887 --> 17:27.489
This ain't about vamps
in general, though, is it?

17:29.659 --> 17:33.033
Look. I know you know about me and Josh,

17:33.063 --> 17:34.538
and I'm not asking
you for permission, ok?

17:34.568 --> 17:38.422
Good because I'm pretty sure
we had the love is love talk

17:38.452 --> 17:40.417
when you were 17.

17:40.447 --> 17:42.293
Yeah.

17:42.556 --> 17:44.356
He's good enough for you,

17:44.358 --> 17:45.615
end of discussion.

17:45.645 --> 17:48.330
I just don't want him getting caught 
in the crossfire, you know?

17:50.830 --> 17:52.530
That won't be easy, but we got no chance

17:52.532 --> 17:53.999
of winning this fight

17:54.001 --> 17:56.868
without something to fight for.

18:04.010 --> 18:05.877
Wow!

18:05.879 --> 18:08.769
I think that's my cue.

18:08.799 --> 18:10.999
There's no rule about seeing each other

18:11.001 --> 18:12.667
before the ritual, is there?

18:17.758 --> 18:18.595
Ahem.

18:18.625 --> 18:22.677
Oh. Ha ha! Is everything ok?

18:22.679 --> 18:24.311
Yes.

18:25.158 --> 18:27.537
Getting a little nervous.

18:27.567 --> 18:30.034
Wanted to see you,

18:30.036 --> 18:32.271
make sure that you weren't
wearing a flannel tux.

18:32.301 --> 18:34.835
Ha ha ha!

18:41.692 --> 18:43.214
Thank you.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.425
I'm... I'm actually glad you're here.

18:48.455 --> 18:50.855
I got something for you.

18:54.269 --> 18:55.969
Um...

18:56.601 --> 19:00.431
The, uh, the stone is moss agate.

19:00.847 --> 19:02.672
You were born under a planting moon,

19:02.702 --> 19:06.427
so it's your mineral totem.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.164
It symbolizes healing and courage,

19:09.194 --> 19:12.412
and after everything
you've done for our pack,

19:13.221 --> 19:16.180
I'd say that's just about right.

19:16.182 --> 19:18.716
I don't know what to say, Jack.

19:20.425 --> 19:23.426
You're wearing Rebekah's dress

19:23.456 --> 19:26.538
and getting married in Klaus' house.

19:26.568 --> 19:29.588
I figured you should
have at least one thing

19:29.618 --> 19:31.805
that's just yours.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.180
(Indistinct chatter)

19:47.161 --> 19:48.746
(Josh): Hey, Davina.

20:02.872 --> 20:04.456
You mind?

20:10.435 --> 20:11.685
(Music playing)

21:13.405 --> 21:15.265
Please be seated.

21:18.963 --> 21:20.403
We gather together

21:20.405 --> 21:22.639
as a community seeking peace,

21:22.896 --> 21:28.188
inspired by the union of
this couple before you.

21:28.513 --> 21:31.180
There was a time when werewolves

21:31.182 --> 21:33.516
saw themselves not as cursed

21:33.518 --> 21:35.125
but as blessed

21:35.155 --> 21:38.087
with a connection to
our most pure selves.

21:40.910 --> 21:43.899
And tonight, we honor that blessing

21:43.929 --> 21:47.196
with the long-awaited unification

21:47.198 --> 21:50.878
of the two Crescent bloodlines.

21:50.908 --> 21:53.069
In doing so,

21:53.099 --> 21:58.007
we choose to embrace
Hayley's vampire nature.

21:58.428 --> 22:01.935
With this union, Hayley will share

22:01.965 --> 22:05.226
here unique gifts with her pack.

22:08.261 --> 22:10.052
And now

22:10.382 --> 22:12.067
your vows.

22:14.504 --> 22:18.661
I pledge to honor and
defend you and yours

22:18.869 --> 22:20.655
above all others...

22:20.874 --> 22:24.600
To share in blessings and burdens,

22:24.823 --> 22:27.169
to be your advocate,

22:27.479 --> 22:29.243
your champion...

22:29.604 --> 22:33.576
To be your comfort, your sanctuary,

22:34.007 --> 22:38.002
and for as long as we both shall live...

22:38.703 --> 22:41.417
To be your family...

22:41.727 --> 22:43.619
To be your family.

22:58.287 --> 23:01.227
You two have endured all the traditional

23:01.257 --> 23:04.095
werewolf rituals and trials.

23:04.125 --> 23:07.159
There's only one remaining.

23:07.499 --> 23:09.995
Jackson, you may kiss your bride.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.347
(Music continues)

23:46.732 --> 23:48.232
(Indistinct chatter)

24:12.884 --> 24:14.569
I know that look.

24:14.599 --> 24:16.661
I've seen it all too often.
What are you planning?

24:16.663 --> 24:18.296
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:18.298 --> 24:20.350
Jackson is marrying
the mother of your child

24:20.380 --> 24:22.195
in our home, solidifying his rule

24:22.225 --> 24:25.105
over the wolves you yourself
once sought to control.

24:25.135 --> 24:28.201
- Talk to me.
- Let Jackson have Hayley,

24:28.231 --> 24:30.542
although he isn't exactly
fit to lead an army tasked

24:30.572 --> 24:35.897
with protecting my daughter.
His reign will be short-lived.

24:35.927 --> 24:38.624
Niklaus, you can't honestly believe
that I would allow you to harm

24:38.654 --> 24:40.151
Jackson on the day of Hayley's wedding.

24:40.153 --> 24:43.639
He's not one of us, Elijah.

24:43.669 --> 24:44.886
He's mortal.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.757
Mortals perish.

24:47.258 --> 24:49.808
- What are you doing?
- Confide in me, brother.

24:49.838 --> 24:52.597
How does it feel when you
see Hayley look at him?

24:52.627 --> 24:54.045
Niklaus, I'm warning you.

24:54.075 --> 24:58.274
Face the facts. You're even
now forcing yourself to deny.

24:58.698 --> 25:03.446
You want Jackson dead
just as much as I do.

25:03.718 --> 25:05.181
In fact,

25:05.535 --> 25:07.894
I think you want it more.

25:25.384 --> 25:26.634
(Music playing)

25:47.115 --> 25:50.415
Are you to be my chaperone
the entire evening, brother?

25:51.643 --> 25:54.500
Chaperone, steward, baby-sitter,

25:54.530 --> 25:58.229
whichever term tickles
you fancy most, brother.

25:58.259 --> 26:00.192
You are welcome to indulge whomever

26:00.194 --> 26:03.251
and whatever you please.

26:03.281 --> 26:05.244
I would only ask that
you refrain from any

26:05.274 --> 26:08.227
- homicidal behavior.
- Just one day back,

26:08.257 --> 26:09.852
and already you've more than fulfilled

26:09.854 --> 26:13.756
your quota for irritating
brotherly conduct.

26:13.758 --> 26:17.460
Let me make myself quite clear, Niklaus.

26:17.462 --> 26:21.224
So long as Jackson brings even an
inkling of joy into Hayley's life,

26:21.254 --> 26:23.084
you are not go near him.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.584
It's amusing listening
to you defending the man

26:25.614 --> 26:26.835
who married the woman you love,

26:26.837 --> 26:28.270
but then you've always coveted that

26:28.272 --> 26:30.408
- which is not yours to have.
- Just listen to yourself,

26:30.438 --> 26:32.646
fueled by your delusions of persecution.

26:32.676 --> 26:33.747
Think, Niklaus.

26:33.777 --> 26:36.784
If you kill Jackson, the
wolves will descend into chaos.

26:36.814 --> 26:39.053
You are acting out of fear,

26:39.232 --> 26:42.456
terrified that Jackson might
be a better father to Hope.

26:42.486 --> 26:44.037
Do not bring the child into this.

26:44.067 --> 26:46.444
Your child arrived here today,

26:46.474 --> 26:49.246
her security strengthened by
those wolves that would defend her,

26:49.276 --> 26:52.459
and you would jeopardize that alliance.

26:52.489 --> 26:54.756
Niklaus, you yourself even mentioned

26:54.786 --> 26:57.653
had you been raised by Ansel
you might have been a better man.

26:57.683 --> 27:01.514
Now perhaps a better man
has entered Hope's life,

27:01.544 --> 27:03.961
and seeing that, you
are shaken to your core.

27:03.991 --> 27:06.664
You have the audacity to analyze me?

27:06.694 --> 27:09.810
That's ambitious, considering
your psychological deficiencies.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.743
How was your time with my therapist?

27:11.773 --> 27:13.849
Was it helpful? Because
it was a great risk

27:13.879 --> 27:15.613
leaving you alone with her.

27:15.643 --> 27:17.936
These days, who knows what you might do?

27:17.938 --> 27:20.272
I have stood by you,
and I have defended you

27:20.302 --> 27:22.041
for as long as I can recall,

27:22.071 --> 27:26.645
but in the name of your
daughter and her mother,

27:27.073 --> 27:28.819
I will not

27:29.330 --> 27:33.072
watch you commit this evil.

27:33.967 --> 27:35.351
You ok?

27:35.381 --> 27:36.888
Yeah, totally.

27:36.918 --> 27:39.773
My boyfriend and his buddies 
are superwolves now.

27:41.727 --> 27:42.727
(Cheering)

27:45.932 --> 27:48.600
It's gonna be awesome.

27:48.752 --> 27:51.141
Hey. At least your boyfriend showed up.

27:51.171 --> 27:53.071
Aw, come on.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.444
Is that...

28:05.026 --> 28:07.042
Kol...

28:07.396 --> 28:08.887
What's wrong?

28:08.889 --> 28:11.204
Aren't you a sight, eh?

28:14.117 --> 28:15.509
You're ice cold.

28:15.539 --> 28:18.363
Now you listen to me, ok?

28:18.365 --> 28:22.000
Finn... he got a bit perturbed

28:22.002 --> 28:24.936
when we went to rescue Josh,

28:25.290 --> 28:27.296
and, uh...

28:28.208 --> 28:31.461
And I thought I was gonna be ok, but...

28:31.491 --> 28:34.003
I'm running out of time.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.817
(Cami): It's ok.

28:49.286 --> 28:50.895
I heard her crying.

28:51.088 --> 28:53.238
Oh, she's probably just teething.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.971
Thank you for taking care of her.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.775
She's actually pretty low-maintenance.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.977
She's been smiling and looking all around.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.829
I think she likes it here. 
It feels like home.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.742
Do you want to hold her?

29:21.701 --> 29:23.908
I know this all must be 
pretty overwhelming,

29:23.938 --> 29:27.096
but some advice I learned
from developmental psych...

29:27.126 --> 29:31.969
Happy mom, happy dad, happy baby.

29:38.493 --> 29:39.743
(Music playing)

29:49.225 --> 29:51.675
Look. I know that this won't be easy...

30:24.389 --> 30:25.679
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:25.709 --> 30:28.077
may I have your attention, please?

30:28.107 --> 30:29.750
Hayley, if you would join me,

30:29.780 --> 30:31.895
I'd like to propose a toast.

30:41.577 --> 30:43.840
I want to welcome you all.

30:44.067 --> 30:48.245
As you know, last spring,
Hayley and I had a daughter.

30:48.275 --> 30:50.680
Due to tragic circumstance,

30:50.682 --> 30:52.191
she was lost.

30:52.221 --> 30:54.717
Now she has returned home.

30:56.193 --> 30:57.954
Her name is Hope.

30:59.276 --> 31:02.099
She will live here among you,

31:02.129 --> 31:04.961
her pack, her family.

31:04.963 --> 31:05.963
(Chatter)

31:06.989 --> 31:11.308
We implore you protect our daughter.

31:11.338 --> 31:14.485
Teach her, love her

31:14.515 --> 31:16.217
as one of your own.

31:27.938 --> 31:29.404
Jackson...

31:30.688 --> 31:36.259
I invite you and your bride to live here,

31:36.579 --> 31:42.932
uniting your proud and
noble people in peace.

31:43.106 --> 31:45.234
Welcome to the family, mate.

31:47.657 --> 31:50.439
To Jackson and Hayley.

31:50.441 --> 31:51.441
(Chatter)

32:01.862 --> 32:03.645
Here. Transubstantiation.

32:03.647 --> 32:05.068
We combine this with the protection spell.

32:05.098 --> 32:07.211
Finn's spell blocks that. The
body Kol's in is already dying.

32:07.241 --> 32:09.434
We need to jump into a new one.

32:09.436 --> 32:11.484
We can't just pick another
body at the farmer's market.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.739
We don't even have the spell for that.

32:15.012 --> 32:16.765
Beks.

32:17.714 --> 32:20.882
Will you give me a minute 
alone with Davina?

32:34.534 --> 32:36.461
I believe I owe you a dance.

32:51.499 --> 32:54.034
A lovely ceremony.

32:54.064 --> 32:57.348
It was. Thank you for being there.

32:57.624 --> 33:01.367
Well, the wolves are unified, 
Hope is safe, and...

33:02.109 --> 33:04.789
Everything is exactly as you intended.

33:09.286 --> 33:11.087
So in interest of maintaining the peace,

33:11.117 --> 33:13.836
I have decided to join Marcel in Algiers.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.733
I believe with the correct instruction

33:15.735 --> 33:19.303
and guidance his community 
may well prosper.

33:19.333 --> 33:21.839
You're moving out?

33:22.107 --> 33:25.542
Elijah, this is your home.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.878
In my long, long life, I've
called many places home, Hayley.

33:28.908 --> 33:33.493
I didn't know that Klaus would ask
Jack and me to live here, but that...

33:33.523 --> 33:37.187
That doesn't mean that you have to leave.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.722
Elijah.

33:45.237 --> 33:46.437
(Hope gurgles)

33:47.232 --> 33:48.732
Hi.

33:54.071 --> 33:56.506
Must you intrude on every moment?

33:56.508 --> 33:58.635
I'm not here to quarrel, brother.

33:58.665 --> 34:02.245
It's Kol. I couldn't help him.

34:04.815 --> 34:07.794
He's not gonna last the night.

34:08.815 --> 34:10.315
(Indistinct chatter)

34:23.049 --> 34:25.375
You know that girl?

34:26.411 --> 34:27.971
I think I might.

34:30.630 --> 34:31.880
(Music playing)

34:51.826 --> 34:55.297
I know that we're in a cemetery

34:55.512 --> 34:58.630
and I happen to be terminal.

34:59.656 --> 35:02.238
You got to admit the stars are lovely.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.175
How can you joke right now?

35:06.177 --> 35:07.510
I'm not.

35:09.313 --> 35:12.682
Under the same stars, there's...

35:13.173 --> 35:15.551
There's some guy,

35:15.553 --> 35:18.249
and he's with this girl,

35:18.518 --> 35:21.818
and he's got all the time
in the world, and he's right.

35:24.161 --> 35:26.106
And I hate him.

35:29.734 --> 35:30.734
(Coughing)

35:32.683 --> 35:34.336
Are you ok?

35:37.412 --> 35:38.828
Yeah.

35:44.958 --> 35:48.716
I think I want to be alone for this bit.

35:49.474 --> 35:50.474
(Coughing)

35:53.877 --> 35:56.083
(Elijah): I'm afraid that's not an option.

35:56.113 --> 36:00.558
Always and forever is not just
something weasel out of, brother.

36:18.053 --> 36:21.189
Everybody's headed home.

36:21.419 --> 36:22.523
Now what?

36:22.653 --> 36:25.827
Ahh. Uh, wedding night.

36:25.829 --> 36:27.977
Awkward.

36:29.164 --> 36:31.489
Uh, knowing you, I'm thinking
you probably just want

36:31.519 --> 36:35.503
to stay up all night,
watching Hope sleep.

36:35.505 --> 36:37.471
That sounds good to me.

36:40.748 --> 36:42.510
Jack...

36:46.101 --> 36:48.106
When I told you that

36:48.136 --> 36:51.619
the wedding was the right
thing to do for our pack,

36:51.621 --> 36:54.021
there was something else
that I should have told you.

36:54.196 --> 36:58.983
I should have told you that
when I first got to New Orleans

36:59.013 --> 37:02.100
I was terrified, pregnant,

37:02.130 --> 37:05.716
for a long time basically alone,

37:06.053 --> 37:08.861
and then one night, a wolf
appeared out of the woods,

37:08.891 --> 37:11.772
and I knew that I was safe.

37:13.408 --> 37:17.625
From the moment I saw you,
I knew I could trust you.

37:18.855 --> 37:20.741
You never made me feel ashamed

37:20.771 --> 37:23.309
about being a hybrid or questioned

37:23.339 --> 37:25.843
why I had to lie to you about Hope.

37:25.873 --> 37:27.493
I told you I love you.

37:27.523 --> 37:28.989
I meant it.

37:32.427 --> 37:34.350
Yeah.

37:35.559 --> 37:39.465
And that's the first time
anyone's ever said that to me.

37:45.389 --> 37:48.842
I want you to know that...

37:48.844 --> 37:52.468
I didn't marry you for all those people.

37:56.472 --> 37:58.652
I married you for me.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.585
That's what I should have told you.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.139
(Moaning)

38:21.743 --> 38:23.229
(Whispering)

38:35.589 --> 38:38.030
All my life,

38:39.328 --> 38:41.988
all I ever wanted was...

38:42.898 --> 38:44.588
You lot...

38:45.263 --> 38:47.623
To care about me.

38:49.476 --> 38:50.476
(Coughing)

39:06.098 --> 39:10.156
Kol, listen to me.

39:10.394 --> 39:12.619
You don't have long.

39:13.196 --> 39:15.660
You're going to die,

39:16.065 --> 39:18.687
but you will die a witch,

39:18.717 --> 39:20.898
and we will consecrate your body.

39:20.928 --> 39:23.944
You will join the ancestors
of the French quarter,

39:23.974 --> 39:26.792
and those spirits can be brought back...

39:28.230 --> 39:30.743
And I promise you, brother,

39:31.171 --> 39:32.845
I will not leave this body

39:32.847 --> 39:35.748
until I find a way to bring you home.

39:40.374 --> 39:41.824
(Coughing)

39:47.702 --> 39:49.842
I tried a different spell.

39:52.138 --> 39:53.766
It's ok.

39:58.976 --> 40:00.973
I'm... I'm not scared.

40:38.482 --> 40:39.482
(Groans)

40:41.221 --> 40:43.181
What did you do?

40:43.183 --> 40:45.439
It took a while, but I healed you,

40:45.469 --> 40:49.036
brought you back from death using this.

40:49.066 --> 40:50.701
Your pendant.

40:53.183 --> 40:54.798
You said it would protect me.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.908
It's a talisman used to focus my power.

40:57.938 --> 41:00.261
I knew it would be
dangerous to face Elijah.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.384
I didn't want you to be hurt.

41:02.414 --> 41:04.552
Just like when we were children.

41:09.025 --> 41:12.645
I seem to recall you were 
always defending me.

41:12.675 --> 41:14.736
You're my brother, Finn.

41:14.766 --> 41:17.890
I love you, and we'll
need to protect each other.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.635
If Dahlia has sensed Klaus' child,

41:20.637 --> 41:22.714
she's already on her way.

41:22.744 --> 41:25.289
Niklaus used magic to cloak
the baby from my mother.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.696
It's gonna take a bit of
time before Dahlia finds it...

41:26.726 --> 41:28.634
You don't understand.

41:29.334 --> 41:33.396
Esther was nothing compared to Dahlia.

41:33.426 --> 41:36.497
I was taken when I was only 5 years old.

41:36.527 --> 41:40.700
I had just started to display 
a potential for magic.

41:41.206 --> 41:44.610
It is the magic that will draw Dahlia.

41:45.216 --> 41:48.505
It will serve as a beacon, calling her.

41:50.056 --> 41:52.499
Dahlia will come,

41:53.005 --> 41:55.836
and she will take what's hers.
