00:18.887 --> 00:20.555
LINDA:
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

00:20.556 --> 00:22.890
Ah! Minutes away from
a hotel weekend!

00:22.891 --> 00:24.058
You almost done, Teddy?

00:24.093 --> 00:25.560
Oh, right.
The big burger meet-up.

00:25.561 --> 00:27.261
Yup. The first annual
gathering of

00:27.262 --> 00:28.963
the North Atlantic
Burger Lovers.

00:28.964 --> 00:30.932
It's also the first gathering

00:30.933 --> 00:33.301
of Bob and Linda's privates,
in a hotel room, in years.

00:33.302 --> 00:34.602
(cackles)
Uh-huh.

00:34.603 --> 00:36.838
That and BurgerBob
finally gets to meet

00:36.839 --> 00:38.406
all his friends from
the message board.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.574
Who's BurgerBob?
Me.

00:39.575 --> 00:40.875
It's my online handle.

00:40.876 --> 00:42.844
So, just went with
the first idea, huh?

00:42.845 --> 00:44.412
Where's the sitter?
She's supposed

00:44.413 --> 00:45.747
to be here by now.
I wanted to go over stuff.

00:45.781 --> 00:47.281
(phone line ringing)

00:47.282 --> 00:48.282
Hello?

00:48.283 --> 00:49.951
Jen, it's Linda Belcher.

00:49.952 --> 00:51.452
Did you forget you're
watching the kids this weekend?

00:51.453 --> 00:53.254
No. Uh... wait.

00:53.255 --> 00:54.756
Yeah, I must have,

00:54.757 --> 00:56.090
because I'm in France
with my family.

00:56.091 --> 00:57.091
Good-bye, Linda.

00:57.092 --> 00:58.459
Crap! Jen's in France.

00:58.460 --> 00:59.927
What are we gonna do?

00:59.928 --> 01:01.462
Gayle already said
she can't watch the kids

01:01.463 --> 01:03.097
'cause she's fostering
a baby chick.

01:03.098 --> 01:04.799
Well, there's gotta be
someone who can watch the kids.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.501
I'm someone.
Well, we could call

01:06.502 --> 01:07.402
your cousin Vanessa.

01:07.403 --> 01:08.870
She's in a cult.

01:08.871 --> 01:10.138
What, people in a cult
can't babysit?

01:10.139 --> 01:11.706
I'm not in a cult.
Aw, come on.

01:11.707 --> 01:12.974
There's gotta be someone
we're not thinking of.

01:12.975 --> 01:14.909
What about the checker
from the grocery store?

01:14.910 --> 01:16.544
She said the kids
were cute that one time.

01:16.545 --> 01:17.945
Oh, she smells awful!

01:17.946 --> 01:19.213
I think your kids are cute.

01:19.214 --> 01:20.348
I'd love to watch
your kids.

01:20.382 --> 01:22.617
Teddy, have you ever
babysat before?

01:22.651 --> 01:23.951
Nope.
I bet I'd be good at it.

01:23.952 --> 01:25.319
And I wouldn't charge
you guys anything.

01:25.354 --> 01:26.854
Uh, I don't...
I don't think that...

01:26.855 --> 01:28.056
All right! Let's hit
the friggin' road!

01:28.057 --> 01:29.824
What do you think
of my walk?

01:29.825 --> 01:31.059
I'm trying something
a little different.

01:31.060 --> 01:32.360
It's bold.

01:33.629 --> 01:35.096
Mm, mm.

01:35.130 --> 01:38.132
Whoa. Looks like Reggie's Deli
has a new delivery boy.

01:38.167 --> 01:41.669
♪

01:41.670 --> 01:43.871
(engine revs, tires squeal)

01:50.079 --> 01:52.213
TINA:
Cold cuts just got hot.

01:52.214 --> 01:54.582
Welcome home, kids.
How was your day?

01:54.583 --> 01:55.917
Teddy?! What are you
doing here?

01:55.918 --> 01:57.018
You're not Jen.

01:57.052 --> 01:58.419
I'm, uh, watching you children

01:58.420 --> 01:59.387
while your mommy and daddy
are out of town.

01:59.421 --> 02:00.421
Why are you babysitting?

02:00.422 --> 02:01.522
'Cause it'll be fun.

02:01.523 --> 02:02.523
How much
are they paying you?

02:02.524 --> 02:04.392
Nothing.
Really? Yikes.

02:04.393 --> 02:06.961
Uh, we'll be doing many
fun things this weekend,

02:06.995 --> 02:09.729
including dinner, roughhousing...
not too rough...

02:09.731 --> 02:11.666
brushing teeth
and going to bed.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.935
Think of me as the
cool uncle you never had.

02:13.936 --> 02:15.069
Maybe call me T.J.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.571
Probably not.

02:16.572 --> 02:19.607
So... what kind of TV
are we gonna watch?

02:19.608 --> 02:21.275
I don't know.
Do you like <i>The Mentalist?</i>

02:21.276 --> 02:22.844
Who likes <i>The Mentalist?</i>
Hands are going up.

02:22.845 --> 02:23.878
Hands are not going up.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.246
Uh... oh, boy.

02:25.247 --> 02:27.181
This isn't going
like I thought it would.

02:27.182 --> 02:28.516
BOB:
<i>Hello.</i>

02:28.517 --> 02:30.952
We have a reservation
under "Belcher."

02:30.953 --> 02:33.888
Or maybe under "BurgerBob,"
my online name.

02:33.922 --> 02:35.423
Yes. Are you folks here

02:35.424 --> 02:36.524
for the burger conference,
I'm assuming...

02:36.525 --> 02:37.758
BurgerBob?
We...

02:37.759 --> 02:39.360
definitely are, yes.
Okay. Mm.

02:39.361 --> 02:41.696
As well as a little
hubby and wife getaway.

02:41.697 --> 02:43.764
You know, bubble baths
and just touchin'...

02:43.765 --> 02:46.267
feelin'... lovin'...
room service...

02:46.268 --> 02:47.902
chocolate... wink, wink.
Oh...

02:47.936 --> 02:49.737
Sorry, we don't have those things.
Oh.

02:49.738 --> 02:51.906
But the welcome cocktail party
starts now in the Sunset Lounge

02:51.907 --> 02:54.308
and your name badge is good
for a complimentary drink.

02:54.309 --> 02:55.743
Wonderful.

02:55.777 --> 02:57.928
Now, I did want to ask:
Do you have a fax machine?

02:58.094 --> 02:59.914
We don't have
a fax machine, either.

02:59.915 --> 03:01.916
(groans) I wanted to fax this to the kids.
Mmm...

03:01.917 --> 03:04.018
Now what?
Can't fax.

03:04.019 --> 03:05.419
All right. We'll just do it
Monday. We'll do it...

03:05.454 --> 03:08.122
Yeah, Monday it'll have to be.

03:08.123 --> 03:09.757
That's where it's all

03:09.758 --> 03:11.759
gonna happen.
Mm. A little small,

03:11.760 --> 03:13.761
a little rinky-dink, huh?
Except for that tub of mayo.

03:13.762 --> 03:14.962
Gross.

03:14.997 --> 03:16.063
It's bad.
What?

03:16.064 --> 03:17.598
It's a bad attitude.

03:17.633 --> 03:20.468
Hey, JustGrillin'.
I-It's me, BurgerBob.

03:20.469 --> 03:22.904
Oh. Hey.
Linda, this is JustGrillin',

03:22.905 --> 03:24.906
he's one of the guys
on the burger forum.

03:24.907 --> 03:27.308
Hi, JustGrillin'. We're
chillin' with JustGrillin'.

03:27.309 --> 03:29.177
(chuckles)
Yeah, that's my wife.

03:29.178 --> 03:31.145
So, we're just gonna
drop our bags off

03:31.180 --> 03:32.513
in the room. We'll catch
you and the gang

03:32.514 --> 03:34.973
at the welcome party.
Yeah... okay.

03:34.974 --> 03:37.018
Isn't BurgerBob the guy
you were talking about?

03:37.019 --> 03:40.154
Yes. Oh, my God. I got to
text BeeferSutherland.

03:40.189 --> 03:41.989
Ah, back from the bathroom.

03:41.990 --> 03:44.158
Was there a lull? What's going
on? What are we doing?

03:44.159 --> 03:45.326
Just watching TV.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
All right. So...

03:46.361 --> 03:47.528
no takers on checkers?

03:47.529 --> 03:49.130
Or Chinese checkers?

03:49.131 --> 03:50.798
No checkers for me tonight.

03:50.799 --> 03:52.867
Okay, I'm just gonna fix
the kitchen sink.

03:52.868 --> 03:55.203
I noticed it's draining kind of slow.
Have fun.

03:55.204 --> 03:56.504
What'd you say?
Oh, I said, "Ha-Have..."

03:56.505 --> 03:58.005
I think we just
said, "Have fun."

03:58.006 --> 04:00.508
We'll-we'll be here. Yeah.
Oh, okay.

04:00.509 --> 04:02.677
What you got there?

04:02.678 --> 04:04.870
Oh, this? A plumber's snake.
To clear out the pipe.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.315
(whirring) Whoa!
Oh.

04:07.349 --> 04:09.584
What's the holdup
with those chips?

04:09.585 --> 04:11.519
Whoa, what am I looking at?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.187
♪ There's a clog in there

04:13.188 --> 04:15.189
♪ And it could be underwear.

04:15.190 --> 04:17.358
What will it find?
Goop? Probably some goop.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.125
Hey, guys, what are
we doing for dinner?

04:19.127 --> 04:21.362
Oh, I know. How about
sandwiches from Reggie's Deli?

04:21.363 --> 04:22.804
Great. I'll pick
them up. Bye.

04:24.866 --> 04:26.667
Hey, Reggie.
Four sandwiches, please.

04:26.702 --> 04:28.536
You got it.
Uh, what you want on them?

04:28.537 --> 04:30.972
What?
Uh, you know, I need to know cheeses, meats.

04:30.973 --> 04:32.807
That sort of thing.
Oh, uh,

04:32.808 --> 04:34.141
surprise me.
Okay.

04:34.142 --> 04:34.976
That for here or to go?

04:34.977 --> 04:36.277
Um, for delivery?

04:36.311 --> 04:37.712
Delivery? But you're here.

04:37.713 --> 04:38.946
Just make the
sandwiches, Reggie.

04:38.947 --> 04:40.781
Okay, I-I'm making it,
making the sandwiches.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.717
It's okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

04:42.718 --> 04:45.019
Hey, Jonas, you got
another delivery.

04:45.053 --> 04:47.521
Mm, mm, mm.

04:47.556 --> 04:49.223
Jonas.

04:49.224 --> 04:50.925
Cool keyboard.

04:50.926 --> 04:53.027
My brother uses his
to make fart sounds.

04:53.061 --> 04:55.062
(groans)
It's not a keyboard.

04:55.063 --> 04:56.664
It's a melodica.

04:56.665 --> 04:58.499
But, hey,
why am I talking about it,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.501
when I could be doing this?

05:00.502 --> 05:02.103
(playing melodica)

05:02.104 --> 05:04.372
Well, get a melod-a-you.

05:04.406 --> 05:06.073
See ya.
Back at my house!

05:06.074 --> 05:07.641
That's where your
next delivery is.

05:07.643 --> 05:09.210
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

05:09.211 --> 05:10.444
If I'm delivering this
to your house,

05:10.445 --> 05:12.179
why don't you just hop on?

05:12.180 --> 05:14.048
That's a good idea
that I never thought of

05:14.049 --> 05:15.383
until you just said it.

05:15.417 --> 05:16.684
(quietly):
It's happening.

05:16.685 --> 05:18.185
You don't have
to hold me so tight.

05:18.186 --> 05:19.420
Oh, this isn't tight.

05:22.515 --> 05:25.084
I'm so hungry,
<i>I'm so hungry. Food's here!</i>

05:25.118 --> 05:27.019
And, Teddy, I don't know
if this will interest you,

05:27.020 --> 05:30.956
but Tina is riding on a death
machine with a stranger.

05:30.957 --> 05:33.125
Tina, what are you doing
on the back of a motorbike?

05:33.126 --> 05:35.327
It's okay. I wore a helmet.
Right, but still.

05:35.328 --> 05:38.297
Just seems like it's a gray area
between bicycle and motorcycle.

05:38.298 --> 05:40.332
I don't know how I should react.
(quietly): Ground her.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.434
And give me all
of her stuff.

05:42.469 --> 05:44.470
Next time, put a helmet
on the food.

05:44.471 --> 05:47.706
My sandwich top is askew! Askew!

05:47.741 --> 05:49.975
Well, come on up soon, Tina.
It's dinnertime.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.844
(sarcastically):
Psh, cool dad.

05:51.878 --> 05:53.879
Oh, thanks, but he's not my dad.
He's a regular

05:53.880 --> 05:55.714
in our restaurant, and
he's watching us for the weekend

05:55.715 --> 05:57.149
'cause my parents
are out of town.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.018
Wait, wait, wait.
Your parents are out of town

05:59.019 --> 06:01.220
and you've got
your very own restaurant?

06:01.254 --> 06:03.455
You're a really good listener.
We should have a gathering here.

06:03.490 --> 06:04.490
Tonight.
We should?

06:04.491 --> 06:06.292
Uh, of course we should.

06:06.326 --> 06:08.360
I don't think I'm allowed
to have a party.

06:08.395 --> 06:10.663
It's a gathering.
Where like-minded young adults

06:10.664 --> 06:12.464
come together
and just gather, you know?

06:12.465 --> 06:14.249
I guess I know.

06:14.267 --> 06:15.586
I'll be there, right?

06:15.587 --> 06:17.085
That's not too bad, right?
Uh-huh.

06:17.671 --> 06:19.038
I'll bring my hair.
Yeah.

06:19.039 --> 06:21.373
Okay. I punch out in an hour.
60 minutes.

06:21.374 --> 06:24.376
And I'll tell my friends to swing by.
Um, okay.

06:24.377 --> 06:26.545
Hey, you good at catching things?
Not really.

06:26.546 --> 06:28.722
Well, get good, so
you can catch this.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.849
(kissing sound, blows)

06:30.884 --> 06:32.885
Caught it. No, wait,
I think I dropped it.

06:32.886 --> 06:35.788
See ya! Damn it. Won't start.
(grunts)

06:35.789 --> 06:37.523
Don't look at me.
(grunts)

06:37.524 --> 06:39.925
I'll try not to. No promises.

06:41.428 --> 06:43.495
You know, these people
are more than just

06:43.530 --> 06:45.898
online usernames
that I share burger tips with.

06:45.899 --> 06:48.000
It's a community.
They're my people.

06:48.001 --> 06:49.935
Okay, save it for
your friends, honey.

06:49.936 --> 06:52.938
Hey, Beefgeek. You look exactly
like I thought you would.

06:52.939 --> 06:55.774
Meatcute! There she is!
(muttering)

06:55.775 --> 06:57.443
Oh, not a hugger.
That's fine.

06:57.444 --> 06:59.979
So here we are, finally
getting together in person.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.448
Party started! You know
what we should do?

07:02.449 --> 07:03.849
Shots! I'll get 'em!

07:03.850 --> 07:05.384
Don't let him
ruin your weekend.

07:05.385 --> 07:07.219
No, no, I'm gonna
say something.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.621
Hey! BeeferSutherland,
it's me, BurgerBob!

07:09.622 --> 07:12.057
So where's your oversized luggage?
What?

07:12.058 --> 07:13.668
What-what are you talking about?

07:13.669 --> 07:15.294
Because you must have needed
the world's biggest suitcase

07:15.295 --> 07:17.596
to lug your
gigantic balls here.

07:17.630 --> 07:19.832
Beefer, I'm totally lost here.

07:19.833 --> 07:22.968
I'm saying it took big balls
to show up at this conference.

07:22.969 --> 07:25.938
Big balls!
Big balls? I-I don't have those.

07:25.939 --> 07:27.773
Why wouldn't I show up here?

07:27.807 --> 07:30.409
Maybe because all your posts are
either crapping on us amateurs

07:30.410 --> 07:32.978
or you're bragging
about your flashy restaurant.

07:33.013 --> 07:35.180
That's crazy. I-I don't...
I don't do that. Mm-hmm.

07:35.181 --> 07:38.150
I asked how to get rust off a
cast-iron skillet. And you say,

07:38.151 --> 07:41.286
"Don't let it get rust
in the first place." All caps!

07:41.321 --> 07:43.756
What a jerk.
I was just kidding around.

07:43.757 --> 07:47.259
Then why didn't you write "LOL"
or "JK" or use an emoticon?

07:47.260 --> 07:50.637
Oh, I-I don't know how to use those things.
Oh, come on!

07:50.663 --> 07:52.598
And trust me,
my-my restaurant isn't flashy.

07:52.599 --> 07:54.767
We've got a funeral home
on one side of us

07:54.768 --> 07:56.001
and I think on the other side

07:56.002 --> 07:58.771
is a guy that sells
indoor outhouses.

07:58.805 --> 08:01.206
I bought one of those!
Oh. Why?

08:01.207 --> 08:03.542
Because it's cheaper
than... Never mind.

08:03.543 --> 08:06.078
Let's get out of here
before BurgerBob yells at us

08:06.079 --> 08:08.947
with his caps lock key.
Wait, I... Blocked.

08:08.948 --> 08:11.784
(humming) Oh, hey, where'd everyone go?

08:11.785 --> 08:13.952
Nobody likes me.
Sure, they do.

08:13.953 --> 08:16.688
Have a shot. You'll feel better.
I don't feel like a shot, Lin.

08:16.689 --> 08:19.024
No, do a shot. It makes you
more fun. People'll like you.

08:19.025 --> 08:20.170
I don't want to do shots.

08:20.171 --> 08:21.660
I paid for five shots,
we're doing five shots.

08:21.661 --> 08:23.595
Go. Wolf it.
(gulping)

08:23.630 --> 08:24.663
Ooh,

08:24.697 --> 08:26.131
we hooked something big.
(sniffs)

08:26.132 --> 08:28.033
You smell that? It's vile.
Yeah.

08:28.034 --> 08:30.636
But so vile you want to suck it
into your lungs, right?

08:30.637 --> 08:32.703
(inhales deeply)
Ah, you gettin' that?

08:32.705 --> 08:34.539
(inhales)
Ah! (grunting)

08:34.541 --> 08:36.975
What is that, sulfur?
Is that Satan?

08:36.976 --> 08:39.378
It's putting up a fight.
(grunts) Give me a hand here.

08:39.379 --> 08:41.395
(all grunting)

08:41.562 --> 08:43.948
Ah!

08:43.982 --> 08:45.184
It's magnificent.
Ah...

08:45.218 --> 08:46.585
It really is. Tina!

08:46.586 --> 08:47.953
We're bonding
like crazy in here.

08:47.954 --> 08:49.555
Be part of it.
Oh, yeah. That's great.

08:49.589 --> 08:51.190
So, I'm gonna go down
to the restaurant

08:51.191 --> 08:52.724
and do some homework.

08:52.759 --> 08:54.493
It's Friday night.
It's time to party.

08:54.494 --> 08:56.095
Grab the bathroom scale...
let's weigh this thing.

08:56.096 --> 08:58.397
Maybe after I knock out
this pesky homework, huh?

08:58.398 --> 09:00.599
What are you, a
bookworm? Huh? Have fun.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.201
Who wants to taste it?
Me!

09:02.202 --> 09:05.204
And then I want to name it
and raise it like it's our own.

09:05.205 --> 09:06.705
TINA:
<i>Maybe they won't come.</i>

09:06.739 --> 09:08.507
Maybe that's for the best.
I really do

09:08.508 --> 09:10.508
have homework to do.
Hey, little girl,

09:10.674 --> 09:11.844
psst. You.

09:11.878 --> 09:12.978
It's Tina.
Right.

09:13.012 --> 09:14.613
Well, uh, come on in.

09:14.614 --> 09:16.782
I'm totally comfortable
with having you all here.

09:16.783 --> 09:18.550
(scoffs)
This place is kind of lame, right?

09:18.551 --> 09:21.186
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Great gathering, Jonas.

09:21.187 --> 09:23.354
It's the leaky gazebo all over again.
No, wait.

09:23.923 --> 09:27.092
Hey. Free burgers
isn't lame, right?

09:27.127 --> 09:30.111
Um, I'm really not allowed
to light the grill by myself.

09:30.277 --> 09:32.564
I could go for a cheeseburger.
Cheeseburger

09:32.565 --> 09:34.299
for Marco, Tina? Huh?

09:34.300 --> 09:35.533
Uh...
Huh?

09:35.535 --> 09:36.618
(sighs)
Okay.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.036
I'll fire up the grill.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.605
Cool, cool. Oh, hey.

09:39.606 --> 09:41.673
Did someone order
some tunes?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.575
I don't think so. An-Anyone order tu...
(playing melodica)

09:43.576 --> 09:45.577
Oh, you were just...

09:45.612 --> 09:47.379
I'm likable.
Yeah...

09:47.380 --> 09:49.047
I know I am!
No, you have friends.

09:49.048 --> 09:50.816
The kids like me, Teddy likes me.
Right, Teddy.

09:50.817 --> 09:52.818
Teddy likes you.
My dad hates me.

09:52.819 --> 09:55.120
Not that again.
Uh, what the...

09:55.121 --> 09:57.456
They just threw
an olive at me.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.057
(laughter) You can't get away
from my olives.

09:59.092 --> 10:00.792
Bobby, screw
those burger nerds.

10:00.793 --> 10:02.594
Let's go check out
the Jacuzzi.

10:02.595 --> 10:05.764
It's open till 9:45...

10:07.433 --> 10:10.502
(sighs) That's nice.
Isn't it? See?

10:10.503 --> 10:12.905
Even if we don't have
room service or a fax machine

10:12.906 --> 10:14.573
and everyone
at the hotel hates you,

10:14.574 --> 10:16.909
we can still have
a romantic getaway.

10:16.910 --> 10:19.044
Oh, no, not you guys.

10:19.045 --> 10:20.946
Come on, Beefer,
let's just come back later.

10:20.947 --> 10:24.216
And let BurgerBob win? No way.
I showered and everything.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.085
We'll just sit here and wait.
Well, you're gonna be waiting a long time,

10:27.086 --> 10:29.922
'cause we're just
getting comfy. Myeh, myeh, myeh.

10:29.923 --> 10:32.524
Uh, yeah.
This Jacuzzi is for...

10:32.525 --> 10:35.394
members
of the Jacuzzi forum only.

10:35.428 --> 10:37.229
That's not a thing.
You just made that up.

10:37.263 --> 10:38.497
No, I didn't.

10:38.498 --> 10:39.631
And you are blocked.

10:41.201 --> 10:44.136
♪ Hey

10:44.137 --> 10:45.704
♪ Whoo!

10:45.705 --> 10:50.342
♪ La-la-la-la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la-la-la-la. ♪

10:50.343 --> 10:53.512
A nice thick layer of chocolate
squares make up the base.

10:53.513 --> 10:55.447
A couple of handfuls
of crushed pretzels.

10:55.448 --> 10:58.383
Top it all off with
marshmallows, and...

10:58.384 --> 10:59.885
Whoa!
Voila!

10:59.886 --> 11:01.153
Teddy Brulee.

11:01.154 --> 11:03.388
Finally, arson
and food together!

11:03.389 --> 11:05.123
Hey, Teddy, can I play
with that blowtorch?

11:05.124 --> 11:07.025
I just want to inspect it,
you know, learn about it.

11:07.026 --> 11:08.360
Yeah, sure. Here you go.
(melodica playing)

11:08.361 --> 11:09.628
Hold on. You hear that?
Nope.

11:09.629 --> 11:10.662
Sounds like
an accordion but worse?

11:10.663 --> 11:12.231
Nope, in
your head.

11:12.232 --> 11:13.498
Nope, it's something
downstairs.

11:13.499 --> 11:15.100
No, in your head
upstairs.

11:15.134 --> 11:17.719
(playing off-key)

11:17.737 --> 11:20.672
Sorry, folks, private party.

11:20.707 --> 11:21.974
Yeah? I-I think
we're on the list.

11:21.975 --> 11:23.208
Right, Tina?

11:23.209 --> 11:25.077
Uh... yeah.

11:25.078 --> 11:26.645
Tina, Tina, Tina.

11:26.646 --> 11:28.413
You're supposed
to be the good one.

11:28.414 --> 11:29.681
Somewhere there's

11:29.682 --> 11:30.882
a convenience store
parking lot

11:30.883 --> 11:32.517
worried sick
about these teens.

11:32.518 --> 11:34.086
Tina, come on, you're putting me
in a tough spot.

11:34.087 --> 11:35.520
I'm sure you're not
allowed to have friends

11:35.521 --> 11:36.755
down here this late at night.

11:36.756 --> 11:38.690
Dude, with that
kind of attitude,

11:38.691 --> 11:39.858
you're only going
to raise your

11:39.859 --> 11:41.426
blood pressure
to unsafe levels.

11:41.427 --> 11:42.961
Don't lecture me about
my blood pressure!

11:42.962 --> 11:45.130
I'm predisposed
to like salty foods.

11:45.131 --> 11:47.199
Out! Everybody out of
my friend's restaurant!

11:47.233 --> 11:48.567
Oh, my God.

11:48.568 --> 11:50.168
Teddy, could you
embarrass me any more?

11:50.203 --> 11:51.436
Oh, that's a
great question,

11:51.437 --> 11:52.838
and the answer
is yes.

11:52.872 --> 11:54.406
Please start.
Please start.

11:54.407 --> 11:55.540
(grunting, engine starts)

11:55.541 --> 11:57.009
Oh, thank God.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.210
Let's just go to the cove.

11:58.244 --> 11:59.578
The cove?

11:59.579 --> 12:00.579
It's the cove
by the lighthouse.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.546
Come by if you want.

12:01.547 --> 12:02.881
I know that place.

12:02.882 --> 12:04.316
It's the cove
by the lighthouse.

12:04.350 --> 12:05.717
And, uh, hey, if you come, uh,

12:05.718 --> 12:07.352
bring some burgers with you?

12:07.353 --> 12:09.388
Here's a little one.
Got it.

12:09.389 --> 12:11.890
Little mouth burger.

12:11.891 --> 12:13.492
We just got our
goop baby to sleep

12:13.526 --> 12:14.893
and we have to
come downstairs

12:14.894 --> 12:16.228
to deal
with this?

12:16.229 --> 12:17.729
We are very
disappointed.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.731
Tina, I have no idea
what's gotten into you.

12:19.732 --> 12:21.199
You can't stop what's happening.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.601
Jonas likes me
and he invited me out

12:22.602 --> 12:23.835
with his friends,
and I want to go!

12:23.870 --> 12:25.270
Sorry, Tina.

12:25.271 --> 12:26.571
You're 13 years old,
it's 9:00,

12:26.572 --> 12:27.973
you're in for the night.

12:27.974 --> 12:29.241
My temporary house,
my temporary rules.

12:29.242 --> 12:30.742
You don't like it?

12:30.743 --> 12:31.959
There's the door
that you can't go out!

12:32.125 --> 12:33.679
I hate your
temporary rules!

12:33.713 --> 12:35.713
Shh-shh-shh-
shh-shh.

12:35.715 --> 12:37.949
You're not my dad, Teddy.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.818
Or my mom. Or my uncle.

12:39.819 --> 12:41.286
And I don't think
you're my godfather.

12:41.287 --> 12:42.521
I don't think I have one.

12:42.555 --> 12:44.122
I'm coming, Jonas!

12:45.325 --> 12:46.792
You're right, box.

12:46.793 --> 12:48.634
The ladder did install
in less than 30 seconds.

12:50.449 --> 12:52.283
(winded):
Hey, guys.

12:52.284 --> 12:54.023
I made it.
Now it's a party.

12:54.189 --> 12:55.419
And I brought
burgers.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.687
Nice!
Not from our restaurant,

12:56.688 --> 12:58.189
'cause I couldn't
get the key.

12:58.190 --> 12:59.457
Hey, that melodica's
not gonna play itself.

12:59.458 --> 13:00.691
Oh, yeah.

13:00.692 --> 13:01.692
No. No.
Oh, great.

13:01.693 --> 13:02.960
CLAY:
No, no, no...

13:02.961 --> 13:04.362
(playing off-key)

13:04.363 --> 13:05.796
Wow, it's almost
like music.

13:07.132 --> 13:08.366
(phone ringing)

13:08.367 --> 13:09.600
Belcher residence.

13:09.635 --> 13:10.868
Teddy, it's Bob.

13:10.869 --> 13:12.003
Wait, I called
your cell phone.

13:12.004 --> 13:13.671
Why'd you say
Belcher residence?

13:13.705 --> 13:14.906
(spits)
Just to be respectful.

13:14.907 --> 13:16.274
How's the conference going?

13:16.308 --> 13:17.942
Uh, it's...
complicated.

13:17.943 --> 13:19.277
How's it going
over there?

13:19.311 --> 13:20.244
It's complicated.

13:20.245 --> 13:22.079
What? Teddy, I can say
it's complicated.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.848
You can't say
it's complicated.

13:23.849 --> 13:25.346
You're watching my kids.

13:25.512 --> 13:27.785
Sorry, Bob.
So is it complicated, Teddy?

13:27.819 --> 13:29.976
No, it's great.
You want to talk to the kids?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.455
Eh, not really.
You sure?

13:31.490 --> 13:32.456
No, yeah.
I can put 'em on.

13:32.491 --> 13:33.457
Yeah, go...
Yeah, all right.

13:33.492 --> 13:34.025
Okay.

13:34.026 --> 13:35.459
(snores)

13:35.460 --> 13:36.733
Louise
is asleep.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.729
Gene's asleep.

13:38.764 --> 13:40.498
And Tina's... aah!

13:40.499 --> 13:42.133
Asleep.

13:42.134 --> 13:43.734
Uh, Tina's asleep, Bobby.
All right, well,

13:43.735 --> 13:44.835
let her sleep.
Okay.

13:44.836 --> 13:46.270
We'll talk to them
in the morning.

13:46.305 --> 13:47.838
All right, well, I'll...
I'll happily put on Tina

13:47.839 --> 13:49.674
if you want to talk
to her right now, Bobby.

13:49.708 --> 13:50.641
No, it's all right.
Let her sleep.

13:50.676 --> 13:52.009
I will wake her up

13:52.010 --> 13:53.144
with a bucket of water
and a cowbell

13:53.145 --> 13:54.545
if that's gonna
make you happy, Bobby.

13:54.579 --> 13:56.447
You want to talk to your
daughter, you got it.

13:56.481 --> 13:58.516
Teddy. It's okay. Stop.
I'm hanging up now. Go to bed.

13:58.550 --> 13:59.984
Yeah. Okay.

13:59.985 --> 14:02.353
Oh, this is bad.
This is terrible! Aah!

14:02.354 --> 14:04.322
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
LOUISE: Hey, you woke us up.

14:04.356 --> 14:05.756
What gives, Teddy?

14:05.757 --> 14:07.658
We need our sleep.
We're so little.

14:07.693 --> 14:08.793
Tina's missing, Louise!

14:08.827 --> 14:10.194
(yawns)

14:10.195 --> 14:11.629
More like kissing. You know.

14:11.663 --> 14:14.198
(gasps)
Jonas! The sandwich boy.

14:14.232 --> 14:17.702
Ugh. The sign says to limit
your soak time to 15 minutes!

14:17.736 --> 14:19.437
That sign says,
"No running,"

14:19.438 --> 14:21.235
and you're running
your mouth, MeatCute!

14:21.239 --> 14:23.174
I bought these trunks
for this conference.

14:23.175 --> 14:24.842
I'm not bringing 'em home dry!

14:24.843 --> 14:26.744
They're gonna be damp
at the very least.

14:26.745 --> 14:28.079
Screw these guys.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.714
Let's just get in
there with 'em.

14:29.715 --> 14:32.016
Like hell you will!
(grunts) (whimpers)

14:32.050 --> 14:34.518
Back it up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy now!

14:34.553 --> 14:36.554
Oh, no, you don't.
Hey, hey, hey!

14:36.555 --> 14:38.389
My wife and I never get a weekend away!
Hey, don't touch me.

14:38.423 --> 14:41.525
This is all the vacation we have
left, and you're not getting it!

14:41.560 --> 14:43.132
I'll go right, you go left.
Mm-hmm.

14:43.298 --> 14:45.301
Hey! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:45.467 --> 14:46.998
Ooh, splashing.
Good idea! I know!

14:47.032 --> 14:48.332
(grunting)

14:48.367 --> 14:49.934
(laughs)

14:49.935 --> 14:52.103
Ah, excuse me. Excuse me.
What is going on here?

14:52.104 --> 14:53.537
Stay out of this! Give me that.

14:53.572 --> 14:56.540
These people are jabbing us
and harassing us.

14:56.541 --> 14:58.309
And they've been
in there for an hour!

14:58.310 --> 14:59.577
An hour? That's crazy.

14:59.578 --> 15:01.679
(panting)

15:01.680 --> 15:03.047
We just got here.

15:03.081 --> 15:05.116
Oh, really? Hmm. Pruny.

15:05.117 --> 15:08.285
I've had a bad feeling about
you two ever since check-in.

15:08.286 --> 15:09.887
That's it.
Please exit the hot tub

15:09.888 --> 15:11.489
so these people may enjoy it.

15:11.523 --> 15:14.245
Fine. Okay, we'll leave.
Really?

15:14.246 --> 15:15.926
Yeah. We're all
grown-ups here.

15:15.927 --> 15:17.428
Thank you.

15:17.462 --> 15:19.563
Bye-bye,
BurgerBob.

15:19.564 --> 15:21.065
(all sigh)

15:21.066 --> 15:24.001
Oh, that jet is
right on my back.

15:24.002 --> 15:26.737
Oh, that's a
lumbar paradise.

15:26.738 --> 15:29.673
I trust your conference
is going well, otherwise.

15:29.674 --> 15:31.175
I'm not completely
dissatisfied.

15:31.176 --> 15:32.476
Hmm.
(Bob and Linda yelling)

15:32.477 --> 15:33.944
Huh?

15:33.979 --> 15:35.479
Hope you like
your Jacuzzi

15:35.480 --> 15:36.714
with extra relish!

15:36.715 --> 15:38.382
Aah!
And mayo!

15:38.417 --> 15:40.317
(all groaning)

15:40.352 --> 15:41.719
L.O.L.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.621
Laugh on loudly!

15:43.622 --> 15:45.322
And post.

15:45.323 --> 15:46.891
That's it.
I'm calling security. (groaning)

15:46.892 --> 15:48.426
Good, we're leaving anyway.

15:48.427 --> 15:49.860
Yeah. And get
a fax machine.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.158
DESK CLERK:
Oh, go fax yourself!

15:51.324 --> 15:53.164
(melodica playing)
CLAY: Stop.

15:53.198 --> 15:54.131
Stop.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.599
Stop, Jonas.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.867
No one likes that
except the girl,

15:56.868 --> 15:58.135
and she's probably
had enough, right?

15:58.170 --> 15:59.603
It's okay, I guess.

15:59.604 --> 16:01.105
Stop if you want
to stop, though.

16:01.106 --> 16:03.974
What about, um...

16:03.975 --> 16:05.776
Let's break
into the lighthouse

16:05.777 --> 16:08.112
and, uh, make shadow puppets
onto the fog.

16:08.146 --> 16:08.979
Eh.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.548
Ugh.

16:10.549 --> 16:13.050
Well, no one else is
coming up with ideas, Marco.

16:13.051 --> 16:16.253
I'll break into the lighthouse
with you without the melodica.

16:17.823 --> 16:19.323
How do we get in?
Through that

16:19.324 --> 16:20.323
window up there.

16:20.325 --> 16:21.959
One of us can go in

16:21.960 --> 16:23.627
and then unlock the front door
for the rest of us.

16:23.628 --> 16:25.029
Terrible plan.
Seriously, Clay?

16:25.030 --> 16:26.397
Yeah, seriously, Clay?

16:26.398 --> 16:27.832
It looks like
a tight squeeze.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.166
I'll do it.
I can fit.

16:29.201 --> 16:30.634
Uh, okay, sure.

16:30.635 --> 16:32.470
I'll give you a boost.

16:32.504 --> 16:33.971
You've got strong arms.

16:33.972 --> 16:35.840
Must be from delivering
all those sandwiches.

16:35.874 --> 16:37.675
Yeah. Uh, can you
reach the window?

16:37.709 --> 16:39.916
Uh, I have to
step on your head.

16:39.945 --> 16:42.501
Ow! Ow!
(Louise grunting)

16:42.667 --> 16:44.181
(thudding, siren toots)
Cops! Run!

16:44.182 --> 16:45.649
(yelling)
(panting)

16:45.684 --> 16:47.651
Wait! Jonas, wait for me!

16:47.686 --> 16:49.520
(Louise groans)

16:49.554 --> 16:51.288
Gotcha.

16:53.261 --> 16:54.984
All right, come on out!

16:54.985 --> 16:56.619
Oh, this isn't my house.

16:56.620 --> 16:59.288
What the hell were you doing
in the lighthouse, young lady?

16:59.289 --> 17:02.558
I was gonna make shadow puppets
to amuse the ships at sea?

17:02.559 --> 17:03.959
Oh, you think this is funny?

17:03.960 --> 17:05.828
Some ship sees a huge dog
in the fog?!

17:05.829 --> 17:07.128
I don't know how
to make a dog!

17:07.130 --> 17:08.194
Everybody knows how
to make a dog!

17:08.198 --> 17:10.266
Oh. Yeah.
(birds screeching)

17:10.267 --> 17:11.834
All right, smart-ass,

17:11.835 --> 17:13.502
let's call your parents
so they can pick you up.

17:13.502 --> 17:14.904
My parents are out of town.

17:14.905 --> 17:16.472
Well, looks like

17:16.473 --> 17:18.473
you'll be spending the
night at the station.

17:18.474 --> 17:19.909
Uh, the police station?

17:19.910 --> 17:21.444
No, the ranger station.

17:21.444 --> 17:24.579
It's the same,
but we have a foosball table.

17:24.580 --> 17:27.348
Reggie! Reggie!
Open up!

17:27.349 --> 17:29.685
You can't wait till morning
for a nice sandwich?

17:29.720 --> 17:32.354
My oldest temporary niece Tina
ran off with your delivery boy.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.390
I'm not blaming you,
but I'm blaming you!

17:34.391 --> 17:35.791
Where are they, Reggie?
Where are they?!

17:35.792 --> 17:38.127
Jonas would sell you out
in a hot second!

17:38.128 --> 17:39.829
You can't even
look us in the eyes!

17:39.830 --> 17:41.263
Where are they, Reggie?

17:41.264 --> 17:42.932
Well, for a while,

17:42.933 --> 17:45.147
him and his friends liked
to hang out in my gazebo,

17:45.313 --> 17:47.303
but then, one night, it rains,

17:47.304 --> 17:49.972
and it leaks a tiny bit, and
they wouldn't shut up about it.

17:49.973 --> 17:51.574
Like I'm the jerk.

17:51.575 --> 17:53.843
Now I think they go to the cove
by the lighthouse.

17:53.844 --> 17:55.177
Come on, let's go!

17:55.178 --> 17:56.846
Wait, I want to see this gazebo.

17:56.847 --> 17:58.347
The gazebo
that cold cuts built!

17:58.348 --> 18:01.016
No, no, no, no, no,
we got no time for gazebos.

18:01.017 --> 18:02.752
Okay, we'll take
a quick look.

18:02.786 --> 18:06.455
Go out! I'm dumping sand on you.

18:06.456 --> 18:07.823
Go out!

18:07.824 --> 18:09.225
Excuse me, Officer.

18:09.226 --> 18:10.693
Have you seen a bunch
of teenagers around here?

18:10.694 --> 18:12.228
They're of the dorky variety.

18:12.229 --> 18:14.063
Yup. I apprehended
one of them.

18:14.064 --> 18:15.297
Tina!

18:15.332 --> 18:17.500
Hi, Teddy.
Oh, you know this girl?

18:17.501 --> 18:19.335
Yes, I do.
I'm her weekend guardian.

18:19.336 --> 18:21.570
Well, I caught her trespassing
in the lighthouse.

18:21.571 --> 18:22.893
You got to let her go, Officer.

18:22.906 --> 18:24.507
I could do that,

18:24.508 --> 18:26.075
or I could let her spend
the night behind bars.

18:26.076 --> 18:27.743
No, no, no!
Li-Listen, Ranger Dainko...

18:27.744 --> 18:29.712
Is it Ranger Dainko?
What's your first name?

18:29.746 --> 18:31.647
Matthew.
Matthew Dainko.

18:31.648 --> 18:33.048
That's a pretty name. Look,

18:33.049 --> 18:34.550
I've only been an uncle
for a day.

18:34.551 --> 18:35.885
I guess
I couldn't handle the job.

18:35.886 --> 18:37.319
If anyone should spend the night

18:37.320 --> 18:39.155
in teen ranger jail,
it should be me.

18:39.156 --> 18:41.824
It's not teen ranger jail,
it's just ranger jail.

18:41.825 --> 18:43.526
Look, maybe she didn't do
the right thing tonight,

18:43.527 --> 18:45.561
but she's got heart, this one,
and she follows it.

18:45.562 --> 18:47.062
She's just a mixed up kid

18:47.063 --> 18:48.564
who's going through
a ton of puberty right now.

18:48.565 --> 18:49.865
Am I right, Tina?
Yes.

18:49.866 --> 18:51.255
And then some.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.235
Well, it's not
that simple.

18:53.236 --> 18:55.037
There's a form involved...
two signatures and an initial.

18:55.038 --> 18:56.839
You got to sign here.
Okay.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.007
And again here.
Right.

18:58.008 --> 19:00.176
And initial here.
Right. Okay.

19:00.177 --> 19:02.578
So, just anywhere?
No, where it says guardian.

19:02.579 --> 19:04.580
So... at the bottom?
No, on-on the line.

19:04.581 --> 19:06.582
So just anywhere
on the form? Just write...

19:06.583 --> 19:08.017
No not on the... anywhere.
Oh?

19:08.018 --> 19:10.186
Just... okay, just
never mind! Forget it!

19:10.187 --> 19:11.687
I was so worried
about you, Tina.

19:11.688 --> 19:13.055
I'm sorry, Teddy.

19:13.056 --> 19:14.456
I shouldn't
have snuck out.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.225
Thanks for getting me
out of ranger danger.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.394
I don't think I would have
made it in the joint.

19:19.429 --> 19:20.763
Jonas, you came back for me!

19:20.764 --> 19:23.365
Uh... yeah. And this.

19:23.366 --> 19:24.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.168
You didn't come
back for Tina.

19:26.169 --> 19:27.603
You came back
for your moped.

19:27.604 --> 19:29.038
You used Tina
for free burgers,

19:29.039 --> 19:30.439
then you hung her
out to dry

19:30.440 --> 19:31.907
when Ranger Matthew Dainko came.

19:31.908 --> 19:33.309
Oh, God, you
did, didn't you?

19:33.310 --> 19:34.743
She's too good
for you!

19:34.744 --> 19:36.245
But good enough
for a lot of guys!

19:36.246 --> 19:39.415
Which makes you the worst,
Jone-ass!

19:39.449 --> 19:42.551
Okay, I'll keep that
in mind as I ride away.

19:42.552 --> 19:44.141
(engine sputters,
Jonas groans)

19:44.307 --> 19:45.888
Oh, no, you don't.
(groans)

19:45.889 --> 19:47.756
Hey!
Nobody... messes...

19:47.757 --> 19:49.725
with my... temporary niece!

19:49.726 --> 19:50.826
Aah!

19:50.861 --> 19:52.983
Yeah!
No!

19:52.996 --> 19:54.263
Oh. Oh, that's bad.

19:54.264 --> 19:55.898
Tell you what.
Instant regret.

19:55.899 --> 19:57.299
I cannot believe
I did that.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.134
Talk about losing
your cool, Teddy.

19:59.135 --> 20:01.370
You're gonna have a lot to talk
about this week in therapy!

20:01.371 --> 20:03.505
Right? Eh.
"Did you lose your cool?"

20:03.506 --> 20:05.808
"A little bit, doc.
A little bit I lost my cool."

20:05.809 --> 20:07.509
Hey, we should call Teddy

20:07.510 --> 20:09.125
and let him know we're
coming home early. (beep)

20:09.291 --> 20:11.377
(phone ringing)
Hello.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.816
Teddy. Hey, it's Linda.

20:13.817 --> 20:15.317
You're on speakerphone.

20:15.318 --> 20:17.019
Hey, Teddy. The
conference was a bust.

20:17.020 --> 20:18.287
We're coming home early.

20:18.288 --> 20:20.089
Oh, goodie.
How early is early?

20:20.090 --> 20:21.824
Ah, we'll be home
in 15 minutes.

20:21.825 --> 20:23.626
Okay, great! Your parents are
15 minutes away.

20:23.627 --> 20:25.427
If we hurry,
we can beat 'em home

20:25.428 --> 20:27.196
and jump in bed
and pretend nothing happened.

20:27.197 --> 20:28.631
BOB:
Teddy?

20:28.632 --> 20:29.932
Yeah?

20:29.966 --> 20:31.667
We just heard
everything you said.

20:31.668 --> 20:33.369
No, you didn't.
I had it on mute.

20:33.370 --> 20:35.437
You didn't.
No, I-I definitely tried to press it.

20:35.472 --> 20:37.111
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you at the beach?

20:37.140 --> 20:38.674
No.
We can see you.

20:38.708 --> 20:40.109
That's them right
there. That's them.

20:40.110 --> 20:41.844
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Bobby.

20:41.845 --> 20:44.013
What is that kid

20:44.014 --> 20:45.214
doing in the water?
(grunting)

20:45.215 --> 20:46.515
Rescuing a drowning
moped.

20:46.516 --> 20:50.117
Oh, God, it's late.
Bedtime, kids! Bedtime!

20:50.118 --> 20:53.086
Anything you say,
Uncle Teddy.
