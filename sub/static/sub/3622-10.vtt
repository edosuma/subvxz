Right on.

you are my prisoner.

Spread the word...

00:39.874 --> 00:43.008
the Wraith Master is destined
to rule Everlot.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.710
No way, dude.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.012
A champion will come
and you will be defeated.

00:47.014 --> 00:49.014

I do, thus the

02:07.728 --> 02:08.727
Say what?

02:08.729 --> 02:09.995
My dad's bringing home

But this time I'm wearing

KIM:
Zeta Flores.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.074
Time for my next move.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.242
Ron, what move?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.910
You and Zeta are in the game.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.879
I got to take it
to the next level.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.046
Really?

02:28.048 --> 02:29.381
What you going to do?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.984
Just be my totally

02:33.953 --> 02:35.420
Oh, yeah.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.390
So who is this
Wraith Master guy?

02:38.392 --> 02:41.426
No one knows, but he's
stinking up Everlot.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.895
Everlot?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.965

02:51.238 --> 02:52.337
Right on.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.939
I'm all about
the virtual worlds.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.407
At least you got
to see some action.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.242
I'm trapped in
the Magnosiun thorn bog.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.410
How can you be trapped?

02:58.412 --> 03:00.412
You're a She Warrior
of the Ice Mountain.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.047
And you've got
the sword of Elsinore.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.448
I know.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.883
I'd slam the Wraith Master

03:04.885 --> 03:06.752
if I could just get
out of the bog.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.887
Do I detect the cry
of a damsel in distress?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.756
Malcolm.
Malcolm.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.991
Oh, hey. Have you been zapped
by the Wraith Master yet?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.059
I have not.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.127
But what a player.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.428
Some say the best ever.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.931
He's just a griefer out
to ruin everybody's game.

03:18.933 --> 03:22.734
Perhaps, Jake, or perhaps
he is destined to rule Everlot.

03:22.736 --> 03:26.205
They say he is both a mighty
warrior and a powerful sorcerer.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.207
( <i>gagging</i> )

03:28.209 --> 03:30.275
Zeta's a she-thing
from the whatever

03:30.277 --> 03:32.044
with the sword
of whozee-whatsit.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.946
She could take on
the Wraith Sister...

03:33.948 --> 03:35.047
Wraith Master.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.015
Is that what she's
calling herself now?

03:37.017 --> 03:40.118
If I just had
the aspen wand of New Forest.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.821
Which is so much better than
the aspen wand of Old Forest.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.889
You actually have one?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.290
Well, you know,
virtually speaking.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.391
That rocks.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.093
You can meet me
in the bog tonight.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.494
Yes, I could.

03:49.496 --> 03:52.064
I can meet you
in the bog with my...

03:52.066 --> 03:53.165
what was that again?

03:53.167 --> 03:54.800
Do you even play Everlot?

03:54.802 --> 03:56.134
I dabble.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.970
How's the game?

03:57.972 --> 03:59.004
Ferociously tough.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.839
How was the astronaut food?

04:00.841 --> 04:01.974
Same.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.309
I thought you were
the king of video games.

04:04.311 --> 04:07.346
When it's blasting something
or racing something.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.148
But Everlot is like this
whole complicated world.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.817
Which Rufus is in.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.886
( <i>majestic intro playing</i> )

04:14.888 --> 04:17.356
Thanks, buddy.
I'll take it from here.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.191
Buckle up, Everlot.

04:19.193 --> 04:20.759
Ron Stoppable has arrived.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.965
I just need some magic stuff.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.000
See that chest?

04:28.002 --> 04:29.501
Watch.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.138
Ew.
Ew.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.866
( <i>sullenly</i> ):
Affirmative.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.634
Ron said he'd meet Zeta in
Everlot,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.102
but he's having trouble...

Trade it with the dwarf.

No. He's got a watering can.

Hmm.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.566
Wade, what do I do now?

06:07.568 --> 06:10.035
Cross the sword of Elsinore
with the aspen power wand of...

06:10.037 --> 06:13.038
..New Forest
and say the magic words.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.309
And what are the magic words?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.081
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

Sorry, dude, got to go.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.138
Wait. How did you escape?

06:46.140 --> 06:48.206
Maybe you haven't heard,
but Zeta and me...

06:48.208 --> 06:49.474
yeah, we're sort of a team.

06:49.476 --> 06:52.043

for your impudence.

Wait! Wait!

06:54.314 --> 06:55.414
Wade!

06:55.416 --> 06:56.982
Hit the ground with
the power wand

06:56.984 --> 06:57.983

06:57.985 --> 06:58.984
Bog open.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.994
No!

07:08.996 --> 07:10.462

07:10.464 --> 07:12.297
A knave can't do that.

I'm no ordinary knave.

Thou shalt pay for thy
treachery, knave.

in the glade of destiny.

Never mind.

about space food again.

Well, hey, what are
we waiting for?

09:59.633 --> 10:02.500
( <i>chattering</i> )

10:02.502 --> 10:04.369
Wade, we've got a problem.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.503
Kim, you must be psychic.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.671
I was just going to call.

10:06.673 --> 10:07.872
We got a hit on the site.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.174
Tell them to take a number.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.208
Something's happened to Ron.

10:10.210 --> 10:10.875
How do you know?

10:10.877 --> 10:13.645
( <i>excited chattering</i> )

10:13.647 --> 10:17.515
Uh... at least I think
that's what he's saying.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.451
Okay. I'll call back that guy
at Everlot, Inc.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.186
( <i>chatters and whistles</i> )

10:21.188 --> 10:23.321
Everlot, Inc.?
Wait, isn't that...?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.623
( <i>chattering</i> )

10:24.625 --> 10:26.191
I think Rufus sees a connection.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.525
Apparently.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.731
The missing project was next
generation gaming technology...

10:32.733 --> 10:35.734
a way to plug the five senses
directly into the game world.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.868
Ouch.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.737
Not literally.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.606
The player would just wear
what we call an immersion cap.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.908
Slip it on and zap!

10:43.910 --> 10:45.377
You're in Everlot.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.879
So it's like virtual reality.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.714
More like actual
reality, really.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.683
It's not quite as
real as reality,

10:51.685 --> 10:53.618
but we're really, really close.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.552
Really?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.154
We'd be shipping them worldwide

10:56.156 --> 10:57.589
if it weren't for the problems.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.457
What kind of problems?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.726
Well, it seems that
once you're in the game,

11:01.728 --> 11:03.628
you can't get out
until you win.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.763
Can't you just slip the cap off?

11:04.765 --> 11:07.165
We tried that with him.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.466
The little guy looks fine.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.301
( <i>ferocious barking</i> )

11:10.303 --> 11:14.339
Okay. Thanks,
Mr. Needius.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.274
Needius... any relation
to Malcolm Needius?

11:16.276 --> 11:17.676
Yeah, my son,

11:17.678 --> 11:19.844
and Everlot's number one fan.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.814
Wade, I know where to find Ron.

11:24.784 --> 11:25.850
( <i>whirring</i> )

11:25.852 --> 11:27.952
Okay, Wade, ready?

11:27.954 --> 11:29.521
Ready. See you in cyberspace.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.755
Well, here we go.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.462
Wade...

11:37.464 --> 11:38.797
you're a giant.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.632
Actually, I'm normal size.

11:40.634 --> 11:43.435
Ow. Great.

11:43.437 --> 11:44.969
You're a spritekin.
You got to start small.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.838
Stupid game.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.607
( <i>clanking</i> )

11:52.678 --> 11:54.713
Wraith Boy's
taken everybody prisoner.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.814
What's his namage?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.515
I think he's trying
to impress you.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.950
By being good at Everlot?

11:58.952 --> 12:00.618
Like, I'm that shallow.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.753
It's just a game.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.721
Can you imagine?

12:02.723 --> 12:04.656
No, I can't.

12:04.658 --> 12:05.690
Hey...

12:05.692 --> 12:07.392
Zeta?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.860
Come on, we got to free
the other players.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.395
( <i>grunts</i> )

12:10.397 --> 12:12.964
Are all girls like this,
or just the ones I know?

12:15.501 --> 12:18.303
( <i>grunts</i> )

12:19.905 --> 12:21.506
Finally.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.641
Tell me you're going
to get us out of here.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.876
Jake, is that you?

12:24.878 --> 12:27.345
What's with you guys
being in normal clothes?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.747
Don't know.
Would like to know. Don't.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.814
Let me guess.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.616
The Wraith Master captured you.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.885
He won't let us out
until we relinquish our power.

12:33.887 --> 12:34.953
I'm not worried.

12:34.955 --> 12:35.954
We'll be saved
by the Tunnel Lord.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.288
Tunnel Lord?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.490
I thought he was just a legend.

12:38.492 --> 12:39.491
He might as well be.

12:39.493 --> 12:40.692
That dude hasn't logged on

12:40.694 --> 12:41.726
in, like, forever.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.361
He'll show. He'll save us.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.629
Better idea...
we'll save you.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.464
( <i>grunts</i>):
It's locked.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.565
Maybe I can pick it.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.666
Do you have a bobby pin?

12:48.668 --> 12:49.667
I don't know.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.369
Let me ask my grandmother.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.804
WRAITH MASTER:
Looking for this?

12:54.907 --> 12:56.407
Yah!

12:57.009 --> 12:57.876
Yah!

13:05.851 --> 13:07.018
( <i>buzzing</i> )

13:07.020 --> 13:08.720
You got to get
that thing checked.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.889
<i>Finestra dementia!</i>

13:14.794 --> 13:16.494
What?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.763
You are powerful.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.799
You would make
a most fitting queen.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.333
I will be queen

13:22.335 --> 13:23.535
when I vanquish you.

13:23.537 --> 13:24.335
Enough!

13:24.337 --> 13:25.403
You should really

13:25.405 --> 13:26.371
stop doing that.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.705
This guy's a total...

13:27.707 --> 13:28.540
Malcolm.

13:28.542 --> 13:29.440
Malcolm?

13:29.442 --> 13:32.577
( <i>laughing</i> )

13:32.579 --> 13:34.012
Okay, well, now
that I know it's him,

13:34.014 --> 13:35.780
I've got an idea.
What?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.382
Run!

13:37.384 --> 13:40.552
( <i>yelling</i> )

13:45.457 --> 13:47.492
The bugs in Everlot
are really annoying.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.593
Ron.
What?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.594
What "what"?

13:49.596 --> 13:50.695
You said "Ron."
No I didn't.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.763
( <i>clears throat</i> )

13:51.765 --> 13:52.864
K.P.?

13:52.866 --> 13:53.698
You're... you're...

13:53.700 --> 13:54.866
A spritekin.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.367
Oh, that's so cute.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.068
Watch it, knave.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.369
WADE:
There you are.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.471
Yo, Cyber Wade.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.840
Hey, Ron.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.141
So, guys, here's the deal:

14:03.143 --> 14:04.709
Zeta and I are trapped
in a warehouse downtown

14:04.711 --> 14:05.877
wearing some kind of...

14:05.879 --> 14:07.445
Immersion caps.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.414
Okay, let's call them
"immersion caps."

14:09.416 --> 14:11.816
Just get them off us
and get us out of this game!

14:11.818 --> 14:13.017
We can't, Ron.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.552
The system's whacked.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.854
It is a game, right?

14:15.856 --> 14:17.755
I mean, bytes and
bits... I mean,

14:17.757 --> 14:19.524
if I don't want to be
here, I can just leave.

14:21.126 --> 14:23.862
( <i>groans</i> )

14:23.864 --> 14:25.630
Ow!

14:25.632 --> 14:28.066
The only way out
is to win the game.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.434
And if we lose?

14:29.436 --> 14:30.368
So...

14:30.370 --> 14:31.469
( <i>chuckles nervously</i>)

14:31.471 --> 14:33.137
The weather here, it's nice.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.472
So we win.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.040
You're the Everlot Master.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.041
Feel up to it?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.010
Bring it on!

14:39.012 --> 14:40.745
( <i>squeaks with fright</i>)

14:53.026 --> 14:54.959
Me? Oh, nothing really.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.595
You know, just hanging out,
being omni-powerful.

14:58.597 --> 14:59.464
What a loser.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.470
It's the Tunnel Lord.

He's here!

( <i>all murmur with excitement</i> )

ALL:
It's...

15:11.010 --> 15:12.977
just them.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.445
you guys are popular.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.980
Huh?

15:18.951 --> 15:22.420
I was about to ask
you the same question.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.922
Be gone, Possible.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.556
Nice distraction, Kim.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.091
Ow! Right.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.860
Distraction.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.828
( <i>groans</i> )

15:30.830 --> 15:31.796
Let's do it.

yourself with your sword.

Ow.

There's something
you should know.

Before last night,
I never played Everlot.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.142
But you had the
power wand of Aspen.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.610
You knew the magic words.

16:52.612 --> 16:53.578
I had help.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.712
What kind of help?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.114
The cheating kind of help.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.615
You're a newb?

17:00.986 --> 17:04.722
We need an amulet
or some spelly thing.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.924
I've tried every dungeon claim
I know. We're stuck.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.226

I know you want to help,

but we know what we're
going to do to save them.

( <i>moans</i>)

17:20.239 --> 17:22.974
Wade, what are we going to do
to save them?

17:22.976 --> 17:24.542
I don't know.

BOY: There's no way you
can change the weather.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.714

Join me
and be queen of Everlot.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.599
Never.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.601
How about going with me
to the Spring Fling dance?

17:50.603 --> 17:51.669
Also a never.

Add "in a million years."

Yes.

( <i>loud footsteps approaching</i> )

Told you he'd come.

I can't believe it.

The Tunnel Lord.

No way!

Get some help.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.212
I'm on it, K.P.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.680
( <i>grunts</i> )

19:49.321 --> 19:50.321
( <i>groans</i> )

19:59.331 --> 20:01.365
( <i>yells</i> )

20:01.367 --> 20:02.433
( <i>moans softly</i>)

20:02.435 --> 20:05.770
Ow! Ow!

20:05.772 --> 20:06.938
Hey!

20:06.940 --> 20:09.106
( <i>groaning</i>)

20:14.146 --> 20:15.746
Hey, K.P.,
let me get that for you.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.847
Thanks.

20:16.849 --> 20:17.915
( <i>gasps</i> )

20:21.386 --> 20:23.788
Everybody! Everybody!

20:23.790 --> 20:26.057
Look, the rules say you can pass
your powers to another player.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.124
That's what we have to do.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.292
Should we give them to you?

20:28.294 --> 20:29.260
Uh, no. No way.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.728
I'm just a newb knave.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.196
Give them to a real player.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.131
Give them to Zeta.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.754
( <i>yelling</i>)

21:06.965 --> 21:09.066
Game over, Malcolm.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.235
The Wraith Master admits defeat.

21:11.237 --> 21:14.171
( <i>all cheer</i> )

21:15.474 --> 21:17.541
Um, hi.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.944
( <i>deep chattering</i> )

21:21.980 --> 21:24.482
Well, the goal was
to impress her.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.350
It just turned out
to be Rufus who did it.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.918
Yeah, Rufus. Not me.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.120
What now?

21:29.122 --> 21:30.454
What else?
Bueno Nacho in ten.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.989
See you there.

21:31.991 --> 21:32.890
Hey, Zeta, you hungry?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.358
Yeah. Let's jet.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.332
( <i>electrical whirring</i>)

21:41.334 --> 21:43.000
Ron.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.236
Sorry about the
whole trapping you

21:45.238 --> 21:46.504
in cyber reality.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.306
Ah, these things happen...
to me.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.142
I was going to be
the Supreme Overlord

21:51.144 --> 21:52.476
of this magical realm.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.145
Now what do I do?

21:56.048 --> 21:58.182
Hey, try out for the drama club.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.183
Drama club?

21:59.185 --> 22:00.484
You've already got the shirts.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.552
You're so right.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.387
I do have the shirts.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.622
Thanks, knave.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.926
Ron, are you coming out,

22:08.928 --> 22:10.594
or what?

22:10.596 --> 22:11.996
In a minute.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.000
Boo-ya!
