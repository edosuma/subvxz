WEBVTT

00:02.574 --> 00:04.875
I just read about
an experiment designed

00:04.877 --> 00:06.209
to see if you could
make two people fall

00:06.211 --> 00:08.145
in love in a matter of hours.

00:08.147 --> 00:09.713
That doesn't sound right.

00:09.715 --> 00:11.982
My research has shown that
it takes three to five years

00:11.984 --> 00:14.584
of shameless begging.

00:14.586 --> 00:17.621
Honey, neither of us comes off
good in that story.

00:17.623 --> 00:18.956
Yeah, I-I...

00:18.958 --> 00:21.158
I saw that article
you're talking about.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.193
Uh, the participants
ask each other a series

00:23.195 --> 00:25.829
of questions designed
to promote intimacy.

00:25.831 --> 00:27.197
And then they finish it off
by staring

00:27.199 --> 00:28.999
into each other's eyes
for four minutes.

00:29.001 --> 00:30.434
Oh, that's nonsense.

00:30.436 --> 00:32.569
I proclaimed my
love for you.

00:32.570 --> 00:34.171
And the last time I
looked into your eyes

00:34.173 --> 00:37.174
was when you thought
you had conjunctivitis.

00:37.176 --> 00:39.443
Other than the fact
that I had it,

00:39.445 --> 00:41.244
that was a magical night.

00:42.414 --> 00:45.148
Raj, would you ever try an
experiment like that with Emily?

00:45.150 --> 00:47.484
What? I don't need
science to win her heart.

00:47.486 --> 00:50.387
I have my family's
wealth for that.

00:50.389 --> 00:52.723
I'm telling you, you can't
create love in a few hours.

00:52.725 --> 00:54.424
Right?
Oh, careful.

00:54.426 --> 00:57.194
You're poking at the whole
foundation of <i> The Bachelor.</i>

00:57.196 --> 00:58.562
Yeah, but

00:58.564 --> 01:00.464
we don't have to debate this.

01:00.466 --> 01:01.732
We're scientists.

01:01.734 --> 01:03.867
We can conduct our own research.

01:03.869 --> 01:05.802
Yeah, I propose that we imprison

01:05.804 --> 01:07.104
two street people.
No.

01:07.106 --> 01:09.673
And...

01:09.675 --> 01:11.008
You didn't even let me finish.

01:11.010 --> 01:12.909
Forget it!
Oh!

01:12.911 --> 01:15.245
So, you can experiment
on all the apes you want.

01:15.247 --> 01:17.848
But I want to manipulate
the emotions of two captive

01:17.850 --> 01:20.817
human beings, suddenly
I'm the monster.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.486
Why don't you

01:22.488 --> 01:24.454
just do the test?

01:24.456 --> 01:27.591
In the interest of science,
I'd be willing to.

01:27.593 --> 01:29.192
What? You're okay with
an experiment where you have

01:29.194 --> 01:32.562
to answer awkward questions
about your innermost feelings?

01:32.564 --> 01:33.830
Yes.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.966
Please, can I do it
with him? Please?!

01:37.403 --> 01:39.636
I've been listening
to Sheldon's feelings on things

01:39.638 --> 01:42.172
for ten years.
Tag, you're it.

01:42.174 --> 01:44.841
Yeah, but what
if the experiment works?

01:44.843 --> 01:46.610
I'm not gonna fall
in love with Sheldon.

01:46.612 --> 01:47.677
That's what I said.

01:47.679 --> 01:49.246
Before I knew it,
he pontificated his way

01:49.248 --> 01:51.281
right into my heart.

01:51.283 --> 01:54.017
Uh, fun fact--
"pontificate"

01:54.019 --> 01:56.119
comes from the Latin
word "pontifex,"

01:56.121 --> 01:58.388
which means "bridge
builder" or "Pope."

02:00.059 --> 02:02.993

02:33.709 --> 02:35.895
Just out of curiosity, Penny,

02:35.895 --> 02:39.129
if this experiment does
make us fall in love,

02:39.130 --> 02:42.431
would you drive me
to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin

02:42.433 --> 02:45.301
for Gary Con?

02:45.303 --> 02:47.103
It's the only convention
celebrating

02:47.105 --> 02:49.472
the life and work of Gary Gygax,

02:49.474 --> 02:52.675
the co-creator
of <i> Dungeons and Dragons.</i>

02:52.677 --> 02:54.377
You know what?

02:54.379 --> 02:56.145
I can honestly say
if we fall in love,

02:56.147 --> 02:58.147
not only will I drive you there,
I will buy you

02:58.149 --> 03:00.349
all the dragon T-shirts
you want.

03:02.220 --> 03:04.453
Okay, babe, let's do this.

03:07.358 --> 03:09.625
You guys are
really being calm

03:09.627 --> 03:11.761
about Penny and Sheldon
doing this thing.

03:11.763 --> 03:12.895
If it were me,

03:12.897 --> 03:14.263
I-I'd be a little nervous.

03:14.265 --> 03:15.398
Why?
Well,

03:15.400 --> 03:16.599
even if the study's nonsense,

03:16.601 --> 03:19.235
I-I don't believe
in tempting fate.

03:19.237 --> 03:21.304
Same reason I wouldn't
use a Ouija board,

03:21.306 --> 03:23.906
or pick a fight
with an Asian guy.

03:23.908 --> 03:27.009
He probably doesn't know karate,
but... why risk it?

03:27.011 --> 03:29.345
I think we're safe.

03:29.347 --> 03:30.580
Well, that's what the bullies

03:30.582 --> 03:31.881
at Bruce Lee's
high school thought.

03:31.883 --> 03:33.015
And then, bam!

03:33.017 --> 03:34.984
Karate.

03:34.986 --> 03:36.719
Well,
are we just gonna

03:36.721 --> 03:38.721
sit here while they do
the experiment?

03:38.723 --> 03:40.256
The two of us could do it.

03:40.258 --> 03:41.924
Yeah, sure, that might be fun.

03:41.926 --> 03:42.892
What's the first question?

03:42.894 --> 03:44.260
Hang on.

03:44.262 --> 03:45.494
Okay.

03:45.496 --> 03:49.232
"Given the choice
of anyone in the world,

03:49.234 --> 03:52.602
whom would you want
as a dinner guest?"

03:52.604 --> 03:53.936
Hmm.

03:53.938 --> 03:56.606
I can honestly say Penny.

03:56.608 --> 03:59.408
Oh... then I choose a janitor.

03:59.410 --> 04:01.944
'Cause I'm about to throw up.

04:03.381 --> 04:04.547
I'm in love.

04:04.549 --> 04:07.183
Let's do something else.

04:07.185 --> 04:09.418
Ooh, uh, Emily
gets off work soon.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.187
Why don't the four of us go out?

04:11.189 --> 04:12.221
Okay.
Sounds good.

04:12.223 --> 04:13.522
Should we call
Howard and Bernadette?

04:13.524 --> 04:15.057
I don't know what time
their plane gets in,

04:15.059 --> 04:16.993
but let me, let me
shoot them a text.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.195
Did he say anything
about the funeral?

04:19.197 --> 04:22.732
Not much, but he seemed to
be in a pretty good place.

04:22.734 --> 04:24.066
Are you kidding me?!

04:24.068 --> 04:26.902
You lost my mother's ashes?!

04:26.904 --> 04:29.205
No, I-I'm just saying
that sometimes

04:29.207 --> 04:30.740
bags are misrouted.

04:30.742 --> 04:32.675
All right, fine.
Where did you misroute

04:32.677 --> 04:34.477
the only woman
who ever loved me?

04:34.479 --> 04:37.613
The first... well,
first, I meant first.

04:37.615 --> 04:40.116
I just need some information.

04:40.118 --> 04:42.084
Uh, what's the flight number?

04:42.086 --> 04:43.352
816.

04:43.354 --> 04:44.987
I really did mean first.

04:44.989 --> 04:47.390
Just drop it.

04:47.392 --> 04:48.924
And can you describe the bag?

04:48.926 --> 04:50.259
Um, well,

04:50.261 --> 04:51.327
it's, uh, black.

04:51.329 --> 04:52.628
There's a red ribbon
tied to the handle...

04:52.630 --> 04:55.097
The world's greatest mom
is in the shoe compartment!

04:57.101 --> 04:58.234
You ready to begin?

04:58.236 --> 04:59.769
Yup. Be right there.

04:59.771 --> 05:01.404
I assume you don't want wine.

05:01.406 --> 05:03.439
Correct. You're not
supposed to drink alcohol

05:03.441 --> 05:05.941
when operating heavy machinery.

05:05.943 --> 05:07.843
What heavy machinery?

05:11.783 --> 05:13.182
Let's just start.

05:13.184 --> 05:15.418
Well, as a Texas gentleman,

05:15.420 --> 05:17.453
I'm inclined to
say ladies first.

05:17.455 --> 05:20.356
Although, I'm concerned that
level of politeness and charm

05:20.358 --> 05:23.793
might make you fall in love with
me before the test even begins.

05:23.795 --> 05:25.761
Perhaps we should flip a coin.

05:25.763 --> 05:27.563
Or if you're familiar
with the rules

05:27.565 --> 05:28.964
of Rock, Paper, Scissors...

05:28.966 --> 05:30.232
Question one.

05:30.234 --> 05:32.201
"Given the choice

05:32.203 --> 05:33.769
"of anyone in the world,
whom would you want

05:33.771 --> 05:35.438
as a dinner guest?"

05:35.440 --> 05:36.772
Hmm.

05:36.774 --> 05:38.007
Living or dead?

05:38.009 --> 05:39.942
Just says "anyone in the world."

05:39.944 --> 05:41.210
I guess that means living.

05:41.212 --> 05:42.311
Ah, that's just as well.

05:42.313 --> 05:44.313
As much as I'd love
to meet Euclid--

05:44.315 --> 05:46.048
inventor of the
geometric proof--

05:46.050 --> 05:47.650
he probably wore
sandals and I cannot

05:47.652 --> 05:50.052
look at toes during dinner.

05:51.656 --> 05:53.322
Oh, I know!

05:53.324 --> 05:55.057
The person I'd most
like to have dinner with

05:55.059 --> 05:58.427
is myself.

05:58.429 --> 05:59.895
You sure that's your choice?

05:59.897 --> 06:02.031
'Cause I've had that dinner.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.466
Well, I haven't.

06:03.468 --> 06:05.368
And while they say
never meet your heroes,

06:05.370 --> 06:07.303
I just don't see how
I could disappoint.

06:07.305 --> 06:09.538
Who would you choose?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.741
Robert Downey, Jr.
You...

06:11.743 --> 06:12.908
Oh!

06:12.910 --> 06:15.911
I didn't think of Iron Man.

06:16.981 --> 06:19.048
You know, maybe after
myself and I have dinner,

06:19.050 --> 06:21.417
we can meet you two for dessert.

06:23.855 --> 06:26.088
So, what do you
guys want to do?

06:26.090 --> 06:28.124
Well, we're the ones
tagging along, you pick.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.191
Ooh!

06:29.193 --> 06:31.193
Have you ever been
to an escape room?

06:31.195 --> 06:32.795
Mm-mm, what's that?
Um...

06:32.797 --> 06:34.296
it's kind of like
interactive theater,

06:34.298 --> 06:35.698
except you have
to solve puzzles

06:35.700 --> 06:37.466
in a certain amount
of time to get out.

06:37.468 --> 06:38.734
There's one downtown
where they

06:38.736 --> 06:40.302
trap you in a room
with a zombie.

06:40.304 --> 06:42.304
Oh!

06:42.306 --> 06:44.607
So, kind of like what's
happening with Penny right now.

06:48.179 --> 06:49.712
"What would constitute

06:49.714 --> 06:52.248
a perfect day for you?"

06:52.250 --> 06:53.983
Uh, well...

06:53.985 --> 06:57.453
I'd probably sleep in,
do a little yoga,

06:57.455 --> 06:59.455
then lie on the beach while

06:59.457 --> 07:02.191
cute cabana boys
brought me drinks and...

07:02.193 --> 07:04.293
probably get a massage
and then cap off the night

07:04.295 --> 07:06.295
with some dancing.

07:06.297 --> 07:08.564
That's it?
Yeah, why?

07:08.566 --> 07:10.433
You didn't mention Leonard.

07:12.470 --> 07:14.904
He's there.

07:14.906 --> 07:17.339
I don't think so.

07:17.341 --> 07:18.607
Leonard can't stand

07:18.609 --> 07:22.111
yoga, the beach,
massages or dancing.

07:22.113 --> 07:23.179
Yeah, well,
he brought a book, okay?

07:23.181 --> 07:25.414
What's yours?
Yeah...

07:25.416 --> 07:28.417
Uh, I wake up.

07:28.419 --> 07:31.587
Uh, I enjoy some French
toast with butter and syrup.

07:31.589 --> 07:34.657
Uh, then a wormhole opens,

07:34.659 --> 07:38.160
and whisks me millions of years

07:38.162 --> 07:40.796
into the future where
my towering intellect

07:40.798 --> 07:44.300
is used to save the last
remnants of mankind

07:44.302 --> 07:46.802
from a predatory alien race.

07:48.606 --> 07:51.240
Interesting,
you didn't mention Amy.

07:52.443 --> 07:55.911
Who do you think made the French
toast with butter and syrup?

07:57.148 --> 07:58.547
You're about to enter the lab

07:58.549 --> 08:00.916
of the late Dr. David Saltzberg.

08:00.918 --> 08:02.751
While conducting studies
on slowing

08:02.753 --> 08:05.621
the aging process, there was
a catastrophic accident

08:05.623 --> 08:07.456
and he died.

08:08.526 --> 08:10.860
Or did he?

08:10.862 --> 08:13.229
Ladies?

08:13.231 --> 08:14.930
Are you being polite or scared?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.100
Yup.

08:20.304 --> 08:22.605
Ah, what a room!

08:22.607 --> 08:24.874
Oh-oh!
Oh!

08:26.911 --> 08:28.444
This is cool.

08:28.446 --> 08:29.845
So, how do we start?

08:29.847 --> 08:32.248
We have to look for the clues
hidden around the room.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.716
Uh, wasn't there
supposed to be a zombie?

08:35.852 --> 08:37.219
Ooh!

08:38.389 --> 08:40.222
Okay, let's hope
one of the clues

08:40.224 --> 08:42.558
is written on a pair
of clean underwear.

08:44.896 --> 08:46.328
Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz?

08:46.330 --> 08:49.565
As far as I can tell,
your bag arrived in Los Angeles.

08:49.567 --> 08:51.166
So, where is it?

08:51.168 --> 08:52.868
I don't know, perhaps somebody

08:52.870 --> 08:54.803
took it off the carousel
by mistake?

08:54.805 --> 08:58.040
So, some stranger has my mom?

08:58.042 --> 08:59.842
Is that what you're telling me?

08:59.844 --> 09:03.612
My poor mother can be anywhere
in Los Angeles right now?

09:03.614 --> 09:06.215
I-I wish I was telling you that.

09:06.217 --> 09:07.650
Um...

09:07.652 --> 09:08.817
but the passenger
could've gotten

09:08.819 --> 09:10.719
on an international flight.

09:10.721 --> 09:12.788
Oh, okay, great!

09:12.790 --> 09:15.357
So, your entire job is
to find lost luggage,

09:15.359 --> 09:16.892
and you've narrowed
down the location

09:16.894 --> 09:20.162
of my mother to
the planet Earth!

09:20.164 --> 09:21.497
I'm sorry!

09:21.499 --> 09:23.933
W-Would 500
frequent-flyer miles help?

09:23.935 --> 09:26.335
That could get you
to Sacramento.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.307
"If you could
wake up tomorrow

09:31.309 --> 09:34.643
"having gained any
one quality or ability,

09:34.645 --> 09:36.111
what would it be?"

09:36.113 --> 09:38.614
Well, not to steal
from the Bible,

09:38.616 --> 09:42.384
but turning water into wine
sounds pretty good.

09:45.156 --> 09:48.424
I don't think you're
taking this seriously.

09:48.426 --> 09:50.092
Come on, I'm just having
some fun with you.

09:50.094 --> 09:51.226
I believe

09:51.228 --> 09:53.329
what you're doing is using humor

09:53.331 --> 09:55.397
to avoid vulnerability.

09:55.399 --> 09:57.566
Fine.

09:59.103 --> 10:00.202
Honestly...

10:00.204 --> 10:03.038
if I could have one quality...

10:03.040 --> 10:06.809
I wish I could be
as smart as you guys.

10:06.811 --> 10:10.145
Ha! Keep dreaming.

10:10.147 --> 10:11.747
Sheldon!

10:11.749 --> 10:12.815
I'm sorry.

10:12.817 --> 10:14.617
That was me having
fun with you.

10:14.619 --> 10:16.185
Look.

10:16.187 --> 10:18.354
You may not be as...

10:18.356 --> 10:21.657
academically inclined as are we.

10:21.659 --> 10:23.826
Yes, that's how you say it.

10:23.828 --> 10:25.761
But...

10:25.763 --> 10:29.598
You possess an
intelligence I envy.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.034
Which leads me to my answer.

10:32.036 --> 10:33.769
I would choose the ability

10:33.771 --> 10:36.338
to read people's minds.

10:36.340 --> 10:39.575
Well, I can't read
people's minds.

10:39.577 --> 10:41.043
Actually, that's not true.

10:41.045 --> 10:42.378
I can read men's minds.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.847
But only 'cause it's
usually the one thing.

10:45.683 --> 10:49.251
When are we going
to get robot eyes?

10:49.253 --> 10:52.955
You're all alike.

10:52.957 --> 10:55.324
Well, what I meant was...

10:55.326 --> 10:57.693
I often misinterpret

10:57.695 --> 10:59.395
how others are feeling.

10:59.397 --> 11:02.331
Like, I can't always tell
if someone is only joking

11:02.333 --> 11:04.333
or laughing at me.

11:04.335 --> 11:06.769
You know, like, uh, if they're
mad at something I've done

11:06.771 --> 11:08.737
or just in a bad mood.

11:08.739 --> 11:10.639
It-it's incredibly stressful.

11:10.641 --> 11:13.509
Really? You always
seem so confident.

11:13.511 --> 11:14.743
Well, I'm not.

11:14.745 --> 11:16.578
And if I could read
people's minds,

11:16.580 --> 11:19.815
life would be so much simpler.

11:19.817 --> 11:22.751
Well, now I wish I had

11:22.753 --> 11:25.554
the ability to make
that stuff easier for you.

11:27.692 --> 11:28.757
Thank you.

11:31.429 --> 11:34.396
Wow, I just felt this wave

11:34.398 --> 11:37.966
of affection for you.

11:37.968 --> 11:41.637
You sure it's not
too much Bible juice?

11:43.974 --> 11:46.308
And the wave is gone.

11:54.245 --> 11:55.445
Brains!

11:55.447 --> 11:59.015
Keep it down!
We're working here.

11:59.017 --> 12:00.450
Okay, we've got
the cipher decoded!

12:00.452 --> 12:01.651
How's it going
with the globe?

12:01.653 --> 12:03.619
We used the coordinates
to locate the cities.

12:03.621 --> 12:05.188
I'm putting the city names
in the grid now.

12:05.190 --> 12:06.956
I'm sure that'll give us
the code to the safe.

12:06.958 --> 12:08.624
Solve puzzle too fast!

12:08.626 --> 12:10.226
Slow down!

12:11.029 --> 12:11.828
Yup! Got the code.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.463
Just saying...

12:13.465 --> 12:16.632
no refund for finish early!

12:20.438 --> 12:22.572
Sure you don't want to go home?

12:22.574 --> 12:25.141
When the bag's returned,
they'll deliver it to us.

12:25.143 --> 12:28.111
No, I'm not leaving without her.

12:28.113 --> 12:30.279
All right, we'll wait.

12:33.885 --> 12:35.818
I could've driven her.

12:35.820 --> 12:37.487
What?

12:37.489 --> 12:40.757
The day she left for Florida.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.726
She asked me to drive her
to the airport.

12:45.897 --> 12:47.964
I-I was too busy.

12:47.966 --> 12:49.665
And...

12:49.667 --> 12:53.369
I made her take a cab.

12:55.006 --> 12:57.707
I was too busy.

12:57.709 --> 13:00.543
There's no way
you could've known.

13:02.714 --> 13:04.347
Be right back.

13:07.185 --> 13:09.118
Excuse me?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.520
Yes?

13:11.956 --> 13:13.856
You better find
my husband's mother

13:13.858 --> 13:15.224
'cause one way or another,

13:15.226 --> 13:18.694
we're walking out of this
airport with a dead woman!

13:23.434 --> 13:25.368
Which book are we looking for?
Uh...

13:25.370 --> 13:27.136
<i>Origin of Species.</i>

13:27.138 --> 13:29.338
Here it is.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.373
There's a black light.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.675
Oh, hang on.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.578
Oh, okay.

13:35.580 --> 13:37.113
Uh, "Brothers and sisters

13:37.115 --> 13:38.781
"I have none,
but this man's father

13:38.783 --> 13:42.151
is my father's son.
Who am I looking at?"

13:44.656 --> 13:47.023
Yeah, yeah, we get it--
you want brains. Calm down.

13:47.025 --> 13:48.991
Well, if I don't have a brother,

13:48.993 --> 13:51.561
my father's son is me.

13:51.563 --> 13:54.096
And if I'm this man's father,
then he's my son.

13:54.098 --> 13:55.398
The answer's "son."

13:55.400 --> 13:56.632
Ooh! There's a picture
of the sun over there.

13:56.634 --> 13:58.234
I bet the key's behind it.

13:58.236 --> 14:01.037
Could be somewhere else!

14:01.039 --> 14:02.405
Oh, got the key!

14:02.407 --> 14:04.140
So, that's the key to the door?

14:04.142 --> 14:05.274
That's it?

14:05.276 --> 14:08.411
We spent $200
on six minutes of fun?

14:08.413 --> 14:10.746
It's like when you bought that
remote-controlled helicopter,

14:10.748 --> 14:13.516
and it just... flew away.

14:15.119 --> 14:18.154
Sorry, guys. Really thought
the puzzles would be better.

14:18.156 --> 14:21.524
Well, to be fair, we do all
have advanced degrees.

14:21.526 --> 14:25.394
Remember that
before you post on Yelp!

14:27.599 --> 14:30.433
"If you were to die this evening
with no opportunity

14:30.435 --> 14:31.968
"to communicate with anyone,

14:31.970 --> 14:34.904
what would you most regret
not having told someone?"

14:34.906 --> 14:37.673
So, it would be today?

14:37.675 --> 14:39.675
Huh.

14:39.677 --> 14:41.677
Well, I suppose there's
something satisfying

14:41.679 --> 14:44.480
about dying on my birthday.

14:44.482 --> 14:46.816
Today's your birthday?

14:46.818 --> 14:47.950
Yes.

14:47.952 --> 14:49.986
Well, that's
always been a secret!

14:49.988 --> 14:51.954
Not even Amy knows!

14:51.956 --> 14:55.825
Well, I don't enjoy presents.

14:55.827 --> 14:57.293
And the thought of people

14:57.295 --> 14:59.729
jumping out and yelling
"Surprise!" fills me

14:59.731 --> 15:01.797
with more dread than the words

15:01.799 --> 15:04.834
"George Lucas Director's Cut."

15:04.836 --> 15:07.169
So, why did you finally tell me?

15:07.171 --> 15:10.006
The point of the experiment is

15:10.008 --> 15:12.308
to be completely honest
with each other.

15:12.310 --> 15:15.278
Well, thank you
for sharing it with me.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.113
I won't tell anyone.

15:17.115 --> 15:19.015
Thank you.

15:19.017 --> 15:20.149
That is so funny.

15:20.151 --> 15:22.418
I never would have
pegged you for a Pisces.

15:22.420 --> 15:25.521
You're making it difficult
to love you right now.

15:28.159 --> 15:30.259
Great news!
Your bag was returned.

15:30.261 --> 15:32.028
Oh, thank God!

15:32.030 --> 15:33.729
It's okay, she's here!

15:33.731 --> 15:34.830
Ma's here.

15:34.832 --> 15:36.365
Okay, thank you so much.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.000
Ma?

15:38.002 --> 15:39.802
I'm sorry I didn't

15:39.804 --> 15:42.405
take you to the airport.
I just want you to know

15:42.407 --> 15:45.308
that I'll never forgive myself
for being so selfish.

15:45.310 --> 15:46.809
And I promise

15:46.811 --> 15:48.644
to keep you close

15:48.646 --> 15:51.747
for the rest of my life.

15:51.749 --> 15:55.518
Oh, no. That thing's gonna
end up in my bedroom.

15:58.389 --> 16:00.256
That's it! We're done
with the questions.

16:00.258 --> 16:01.791
All that's left to do is

16:01.793 --> 16:02.758
stare into each other's eyes

16:02.760 --> 16:04.226
for four minutes
without talking.

16:04.228 --> 16:06.062
Okay. Wait, hang on!

16:06.064 --> 16:08.631
Bladder check.

16:08.633 --> 16:11.634
We're good to go.

16:11.636 --> 16:13.869
You ready?

16:13.871 --> 16:14.937
Yes.

16:14.939 --> 16:17.106
And begin.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:32.390 --> 16:35.224
This is kind of creepy.

16:35.226 --> 16:37.059
We're not supposed to
talk during this part.

16:37.061 --> 16:39.795
Sorry.

16:45.603 --> 16:48.504
This is kind of creepy.

16:48.506 --> 16:50.272
Do you want to stop?

16:50.274 --> 16:52.174
I know you have trouble
with eye contact.

16:52.176 --> 16:55.578
Well, you have a brown fleck

16:55.580 --> 16:57.813
in your right iris that looks

16:57.815 --> 17:01.350
like a Formula One race car.

17:01.352 --> 17:05.387
So... I'm just
concentrating on that.

17:05.390 --> 17:08.958
Plus, it's easier around people
that I'm comfortable with.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.627
Aw, sweetie,
I'm comfortable around you, too.

17:12.630 --> 17:15.397
Of course you are,
I'm warm and soothing.

17:17.068 --> 17:19.969
I'm like a human bowl
of tomato soup.

17:19.971 --> 17:23.005
I meant more like
a little brother.

17:23.007 --> 17:25.040
Oh.

17:25.042 --> 17:28.109
Well, I suppose I do think
of you as a sister.

17:29.847 --> 17:32.615
And sometimes, a mother.

17:32.617 --> 17:34.717
It's getting creepy again.

17:42.927 --> 17:43.959
What?

17:43.961 --> 17:45.961
Just thinking about the day

17:45.963 --> 17:47.329
I met you and Leonard.

17:47.331 --> 17:49.098
It was a Monday afternoon.

17:49.100 --> 17:52.368
You joined us for Indian food.

17:52.370 --> 17:54.703
Can you believe
it's been eight years?

17:54.705 --> 17:57.807
Yeah, and you're
still eating our food.

18:01.112 --> 18:02.578
I... can't remember a time

18:02.580 --> 18:05.314
you guys weren't in my life.

18:05.316 --> 18:07.983
I remember it perfectly.

18:09.053 --> 18:11.554
But I have an eidetic memory.

18:11.556 --> 18:14.090
If you're interested,
I also remember

18:14.092 --> 18:17.026
how much you owe us
for the food.

18:20.665 --> 18:23.199
That's it.

18:23.201 --> 18:24.467
That wasn't so bad.

18:24.469 --> 18:25.668
No, it wasn't.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.336
Uh, now let's tabulate

18:27.338 --> 18:28.637
the results of the experiment.

18:28.639 --> 18:30.339
Okay.

18:30.341 --> 18:34.343
I think it's safe to say that
you're not in love with me

18:34.345 --> 18:36.245
and I'm not in love with you.

18:36.247 --> 18:38.881
And psychology has once again

18:38.883 --> 18:42.718
proved itself the doofus
of the sciences.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.087
Well, maybe.

18:45.089 --> 18:47.022
But I'm still glad we did it.

18:47.024 --> 18:49.558
I do feel closer to you.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.528
And I, you.

18:52.530 --> 18:55.664
And yes, that's
how you say that.

18:57.401 --> 19:00.803
Yeah, so, given our
newfound intimacy,

19:00.805 --> 19:02.371
I'd say we have

19:02.373 --> 19:03.873
some hard choices to make.

19:03.875 --> 19:04.974
Like what?

19:04.976 --> 19:08.344
Gary Con--
do we fly or drive?

19:08.346 --> 19:09.745
Do we wear costumes?

19:09.747 --> 19:11.947
And if so...

19:11.949 --> 19:14.884
who gets to be Gary?

19:23.484 --> 19:26.151
Thank you for walking me home.

19:26.153 --> 19:28.687
I just want to make sure
you get there safe.

19:30.084 --> 19:33.553
Well, this is me.

19:34.822 --> 19:36.756
It's been a very
interesting evening.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.391
It really has.

19:41.296 --> 19:43.095
Surprise!
Aah!

19:46.188 --> 19:48.433
And after I let you be Gary!
