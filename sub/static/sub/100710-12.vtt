WEBVTT

00:10.967 --> 00:14.188
- Barry, please!

00:14.231 --> 00:16.929
That's not me!

00:21.064 --> 00:24.589
This can't be happening.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.504
- Are you real?

00:27.723 --> 00:29.159
No, of course you're not.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.856
That's it. That's it.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.207
I've finally lost it.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.644
- It's okay.
I-I'm real.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.218
Oh, my--

00:46.568 --> 00:48.091
I...

00:48.135 --> 00:51.355
Oh, I-I...

00:51.399 --> 00:53.749
I can't believe
I'm talking to another person.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.099
It's been so long.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.535
- Wait, I know you--

00:57.579 --> 00:58.971
you and your husband,
Joseph Carver,

00:59.015 --> 01:00.582
you founded
McCulloch Technologies.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.106
You're Eva McCulloch.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.587
But you're supposed
to be dead.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.458
- No.

01:07.502 --> 01:09.243
Not dead.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.983
Just trapped.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.640
Now so are you.

01:35.312 --> 01:38.576
You see, until now,
this place was a whole world

01:38.620 --> 01:42.145
with one inhabitant...

01:42.189 --> 01:44.234
Me.
- This must be another Earth.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.932
- Same Earth.
Another dimension.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.413
You see, a mirror-version
of Central City.

01:49.457 --> 01:53.330
Same city, same buildings,
just empty.

01:55.637 --> 01:58.944
Who are you anyway?

01:58.988 --> 02:00.337
- I'm Iris West-Allen.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.426
I'm a reporter
for "The CC Citizen."

02:02.470 --> 02:04.124
- Never heard of it.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.864
Not that it matters.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.649
God, it feels so good
to have a conversation

02:07.692 --> 02:09.868
that's not one-sided.

02:09.912 --> 02:13.002
- Everything is backwards.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.351
Eva, you said that this place

02:14.395 --> 02:16.701
was a mirror-version
of our own.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.877
How is that possible?

02:18.921 --> 02:21.793
- Think of it like this:

02:21.837 --> 02:24.013
our reality is observed
by three dimensions:

02:24.056 --> 02:25.841
width, depth, and length.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.451
The superstring theory posits

02:27.495 --> 02:29.845
that there are other realities,

02:29.888 --> 02:33.370
fractal dimensions
humans can't see.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.503
So...

02:35.546 --> 02:37.679
Two sides.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.203
One, our world.

02:40.247 --> 02:43.119
The other is just
some empty reflection.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.470
I'm a quantum engineer.

02:46.514 --> 02:49.647
It's--
it's my wheelhouse.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.743
Yeah, that is a side-effect
of this dimension.

02:58.787 --> 03:02.530
I--
I barely notice them anymore.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.837
- How did you end up here, Eva?

03:05.881 --> 03:07.404
- Six years ago,

03:07.448 --> 03:10.842
I was developing
the technology

03:10.886 --> 03:13.236
to open doors to other
planes of existence.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.195
I was in my office

03:15.238 --> 03:18.850
the night Harrison Wells'
dream went up in smoke.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.689
I've been here ever since.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.778
- Dark matter must have
washed over that mirror

03:33.822 --> 03:35.867
and created a doorway.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.696
I was in this office
when I got pulled in too.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.046
But that's not all.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.613
There is someone else on
the other side of that mirror,

03:42.657 --> 03:43.701
another me.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.877
How is that possible, Eva?

03:45.921 --> 03:49.229
- A fractal variable
caused by the mirror.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.405
A duplicate of you.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.971
- You mean the mirror left
a fake clone of me

03:53.015 --> 03:54.799
in the real world?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.061
We're getting out of here.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.976
- I've tried.
For six years,

03:58.020 --> 04:00.457
I've been in
my own personal hell.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.764
- Eva, I have to go home.

04:02.807 --> 04:05.419
- I'm sorry
you're stuck here, but...

04:07.812 --> 04:11.381
I thought I was gonna
die here alone.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.905
At least now there's two of us.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.648
- Investigation into
the disappearance

04:17.692 --> 04:19.563
of socialite Sue Dearbon.

04:19.607 --> 04:23.915
Day 274

04:23.959 --> 04:27.179
since her parents
first hired me to find her.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.662
Status update.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.185
Nothing.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.970
Sue's trail went cold
in Midway City

04:35.013 --> 04:37.842
after Remington Meister
provided a dead end.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.454
However, she was there.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.760
Meister confirmed that much.

04:42.804 --> 04:46.460
- Hey, what are you still
doing here--oh, seriously?

04:46.503 --> 04:48.200
Ralph.
When I left last night,

04:48.244 --> 04:50.420
you were standing here staring
at the exact same board,

04:50.464 --> 04:51.987
same as the night before.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.293
Honey, don't you think maybe

04:53.336 --> 04:54.816
it's time
you got a little help?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.514
And a shower?
- Cecile, this is my process.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.603
I work things out with
the only person

04:59.647 --> 05:02.040
that can keep up with
my beautiful detective mind.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.781
Me.
- You could work with me.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.957
We took down the FEMA guy
together, that was so great.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.785
You're not loving that,
all right.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.178
Um...
- Cecile, you know me.

05:09.221 --> 05:11.441
I-I like doing things
my own way.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.138
- Ralph...

05:13.182 --> 05:15.140
every Holmes needs a Watson.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.318
- Hang on.
- Mm-mm.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.017
What is it?

05:22.060 --> 05:23.975
- So a couple months ago,
I put up these alerts

05:24.019 --> 05:26.630
on Sue's bank accounts,
trusts, and credit cards.

05:26.674 --> 05:30.242
Apparently, she just made
a small deposit on..

05:30.286 --> 05:32.984
an apartment in Central City.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.508
See? Told you.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.075
Only partner I need is...
This guy.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.556
- Mm-hmm.
- See you.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.692
- Oh, wow, something definitely
just died in here.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.093
- Kara and Lex Luthor?

05:55.137 --> 05:56.530
Man, this post-Crisis world

05:56.573 --> 05:57.879
gets harder to understand
every day.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.663
- Right?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.361
Man.
- What's wrong?

06:01.404 --> 06:03.188
- I'm still sore

06:03.232 --> 06:06.104
from our little double date
with Amunet and Goldface.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.410
So, so weird.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.759
- Maybe you should stay
home today.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.935
- No, no.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.198
Are you working on
more Black Hole stuff?

06:13.242 --> 06:15.026
- Yeah, I think I am getting

06:15.070 --> 06:18.029
really close to taking this
son of a bitch down.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.205
- Yeah.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.685
That's the mirror gun?

06:21.729 --> 06:23.383
- Yeah,
it contains bleeding-edge

06:23.426 --> 06:24.775
reflective micro-chip
technology.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.429
If I can examine the gun
up close,

06:26.473 --> 06:28.431
then maybe I can find
some kind of small clue

06:28.475 --> 06:30.694
that connects the gun
to Black Hole

06:30.738 --> 06:33.523
since McCulloch created it.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.960
It's still
in the Starchives, right?

06:36.004 --> 06:37.919
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

06:37.962 --> 06:41.444
- Could you, um,
get it for me?

06:41.488 --> 06:43.968
- Uh...

06:44.012 --> 06:45.448
I-I mean,
unlocking a weapon like that

06:45.492 --> 06:47.232
sounds like a bad idea.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.539
- Barry, it's me.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.976
- I-I know, but I mean,
after what just happened

06:52.020 --> 06:53.717
with you and Carver--
w-what if the gun

06:53.761 --> 06:55.240
fell into the wrong hands?

06:55.284 --> 06:56.285
Just like the cold gun
fell into Snart's.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.243
- It won't, trust me.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.463
- Iris, I--
look, you I trust,

07:00.507 --> 07:02.160
but, um, the guy
who just tried to

07:02.204 --> 07:04.075
to have you assassinated,

07:04.119 --> 07:05.555
not so much.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.992
I mean, and if Black Hole
had a weapon

07:08.036 --> 07:09.559
as powerful
as the mirror gun,

07:09.603 --> 07:11.909
I mean, there's no telling
what could happen.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.998
- Yeah, you're right.
I will--um,

07:14.042 --> 07:15.260
I'll try a different angle.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.134
- I'm just being cautious.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.571
- Yeah, I know, I get it.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.443
Have fun.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.662
- Okay.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.505
Not exactly the Ritz.

07:48.685 --> 07:49.991
- Get down!

07:56.824 --> 07:58.478
- What the hell, lady?

07:58.521 --> 08:00.305
- Hey, I just saved your life.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.003
You're welcome, by the way.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.617
- Oh, my God.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.880
It's you.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.969
You're Sue Dearbon.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.494
- In the flesh.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.366
And you are?

08:20.456 --> 08:22.327
- No one followed us.
We're clear.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.895
- Sue, I--
I have been looking for you

08:24.939 --> 08:26.897
for nine months.
- Ouch.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.638
I hope you don't bill
by the hour.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.335
- Where have you been?

08:30.379 --> 08:32.207
A-and why did your apartment
explode in my face?

08:32.250 --> 08:33.643
- Yeah, hate it
when that happens.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.427
- Look, I'm serious.
Now who set that bomb?

08:35.471 --> 08:36.907
Why are they trying
to kill you?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.996
And how long has this been
going on for?

08:39.040 --> 08:41.564
- Uh, my ex.
Because I know too much.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.827
About nine months.
You done?

08:43.871 --> 08:45.568
- No, I'm most certainly
not done.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.658
Why is your ex sending you
explosive candy grams?

08:48.702 --> 08:51.748
- Ooh, the cheap stuff.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.362
Look.
Drinks later.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.669
Spilling your guts
to tell a tragic story?

08:59.713 --> 09:01.541
That'd be now.
- Fine.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.847
I fell in love with a murderer.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.197
Happy?

09:10.724 --> 09:12.377
John Loring.

09:12.421 --> 09:16.033
Turns out Mr. Dreamy Muscles
and charisma-for-miles

09:16.077 --> 09:18.688
was also a major arms dealer
on the black market.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.472
- So why does Loring
want you dead?

09:20.516 --> 09:23.737
- Because I stumbled across
his client lists,

09:23.780 --> 09:25.565
weapons inventory,
and everything else

09:25.608 --> 09:28.045
that exposes him
for the bag of crap that he is.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.221
The first time
he tried to kill me,

09:30.265 --> 09:32.093
I was asleep.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.703
- All right, well...

09:35.357 --> 09:37.141
- Who are you calling, Slick?
- Your parents.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.753
To let 'em know you're safe.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.406
- Hmm.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.627
- What--
come on, I just switched plans.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.455
- John can track your phone.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.718
You call my parents,
they're dead.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.502
- All right, then, uh,
we'll go to the police.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.330
I know a Precinct Captain
who can help us.

09:52.374 --> 09:55.246
- The last time I tried that,
they tried to kill me too.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.639
John's got cops on the payroll

09:56.683 --> 09:58.772
in every city he does business.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.646
- Then what's your plan
to get out of this?

10:03.690 --> 10:07.737
Sue, you can't run forever.

10:07.781 --> 10:09.086
- Who says I'm running?

10:10.697 --> 10:13.264
- You and Loring
are hunting each other.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.831
That's why
you're in Central City.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.094
- John's in town
for a massive sale.

10:17.138 --> 10:20.141
If I can get damning evidence
on what he's doing,

10:20.184 --> 10:21.925
he goes to jail.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.274
And I go home.

10:23.318 --> 10:26.103
I smell a mystery.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.149
- I smell...

10:28.192 --> 10:29.629
Expired milk.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.152
- Look, everything
is gonna be fine.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.806
Your parents hired me
to do whatever it takes

10:32.849 --> 10:33.981
to bring you home safely.

10:34.024 --> 10:36.200
And that's what I'm gonna do.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.463
- How?
- Easy.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.770
I'm gonna find Loring,
I'm gonna get your evidence,

10:40.814 --> 10:42.293
then I'm gonna take it to CCPD.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.644
And after I do that,
I'm gonna take you home.

10:44.687 --> 10:48.473
- John's a killer.
You'd be risking your life.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.475
For me.

10:50.519 --> 10:55.480
If you get killed...

10:55.524 --> 10:58.135
my parents are out good money.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.050
I'm coming with you.

11:02.836 --> 11:06.317
1,322. 1,322.

11:06.361 --> 11:11.540
1,322. 1,322.
Okay.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.847
- Eva, there has got
to be a way out of here

11:13.890 --> 11:15.022
that we haven't thought of yet.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.893
- There isn't.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.504
There's only two options
in this place:

11:19.548 --> 11:22.159
survival or madness.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.683
1,322...

11:23.726 --> 11:26.511
- Eva, my husband will
be looking for me, please.

11:26.555 --> 11:30.167
- This is how it all starts!
Don't you understand?

11:30.211 --> 11:32.692
You sit here and you think
everything's gonna work out.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.868
You can't possibly
stay here forever,

11:34.911 --> 11:40.047
and then 1,322.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.092
- That's how many times I've
tried to escape this place.

11:42.136 --> 11:45.182
That's how many times
I've failed.

11:45.226 --> 11:48.098
1,322 reminders

11:48.142 --> 11:50.884
that I'm never
leaving this place.

11:53.103 --> 11:56.716
So please don't...

11:56.759 --> 11:58.848
give me another one.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.859
I'm having a really
bad hair day.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.778
I'm sorry.
I--

12:15.822 --> 12:19.216
I've been alone
for a very long time.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.741
- Well, you're not anymore.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.091
We just need
one way out of here, Eva.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.788
That's it.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.752
Sam Scudder.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.405
- Who?

12:34.449 --> 12:37.278
- He was one of the bad guys.
He trapped--

12:37.321 --> 12:39.933
someone in a mirror
a few years ago.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.587
And my friends got him out by
bringing it to absolute zero.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.241
We--

12:44.285 --> 12:46.591
Eva, we just need to find
some liquid nitrogen.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.115
- Well, I-I have a lab
down the hall.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.899
There should be some in there.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.423
The nitrogen should slow down
the mirror's molecules

12:52.467 --> 12:54.948
to the lowest enthalpy
state possible.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.080
Oh, my God.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.082
This could work.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.482
- Hey, Barr.
Morning.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.005
- Hey.
- You got a sec?

13:09.049 --> 13:10.441
- Yeah, what's up, Captain?

13:10.485 --> 13:11.791
- Eh.
- Yeah, that never gets old.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.836
- Yeah, it kinda does.
Um, listen.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.274
There was a house fire
on Batton Street last month.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.667
- Okay.
- The occupant died

13:18.710 --> 13:20.321
of smoke inhalation.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.976
I'm wondering if you could
take a second look.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.934
- Joe, this case was already
declared an accident.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.110
- Yeah.

13:27.154 --> 13:30.679
I need, uh, fresh pair
of eyes on it.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.681
- Okay, I mean,
what am I looking for?

13:32.724 --> 13:35.466
- Whatever you find.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.164
- Joe, I mean,
I've got a mountain of cases

13:37.207 --> 13:38.556
I need to go through.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.297
Ones that haven't
been solved already.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.300
- Okay, all I can say

13:43.344 --> 13:45.563
is that you'd be
doing me a favor.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.348
And whatever you find, Barr,

13:47.391 --> 13:50.046
bring it directly to me.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.135
- Okay.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.050
- Thank you.

13:59.621 --> 14:00.970
- John owns that warehouse.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.407
That's where the deal
will go down.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.540
- Where are you going?

14:05.583 --> 14:07.585
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.196
- Oh, look, I get it.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.850
Chivalry's your brand.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.199
- You're an MIT grad,
speak six languages,

14:12.242 --> 14:13.896
and you play polo.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.376
You belong in a country club,
not in the field.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.770
You belong in the 19th Century
with your Victorian,

14:18.814 --> 14:20.598
save-the-damsel-in-distress
crap.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.731
- Loring doesn't know
that I'm coming,

14:22.774 --> 14:24.994
so I have the element
of surprise.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.517
You, on the other hand,

14:26.561 --> 14:27.867
he might kinda know
that you're coming.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.391
Translation:
stay in the car, please.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.590
I hope Loring looks good
in orange.

14:57.853 --> 15:01.639
Uh, I don't suppose
you're a fellow bird watcher?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.773
Huh.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.569
- Hey, Vin Diesel!

15:22.878 --> 15:25.837
You still want me
to wait in the car?

15:35.717 --> 15:38.938
- So you mind telling me
how you know martial arts?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.765
- My parents sent me to Kyoto
for a summer.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.637
Trained with a blind sensei.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.813
Taught me everything I know.
- Really?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.336
- No.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.078
I trained with a guy
named Frank at a YMCA.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.688
Will you relax?

15:50.732 --> 15:52.952
We're safe here.
John's not stupid.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.083
Killing me in a public place?

15:54.127 --> 15:55.693
Uh-uh, it's not gonna happen.

15:55.737 --> 15:58.261
- I'm sorry, I believe
he blew up an apartment

15:58.305 --> 15:59.436
to get to you.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.481
- That building was scheduled

16:00.524 --> 16:02.004
for demolition next month.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.789
But he does know
that someone's after him now.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.269
It'll make him
harder to get to.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.488
Thanks to you.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.100
- Where are you going?

16:11.144 --> 16:12.275
- Sorry, Slick.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.668
I can't partner up with someone

16:13.711 --> 16:14.843
who doesn't think
I can pull my own weight.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.801
- Hang on a second, Sue.
Hang on.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.152
Will you just
hang on one second, please?

16:19.195 --> 16:20.980
Look, when I take a case,

16:21.023 --> 16:23.286
I see it through to the end.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.680
And this doesn't end
until you're safe.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.421
- Do you trust me, Ralph?

16:29.336 --> 16:31.338
- I just met you.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.166
But you did save my keister.

16:33.209 --> 16:36.517
Twice.
And that means I owe you.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.735
And I always pay my debts.

16:37.779 --> 16:40.129
- I'll take that as a yes.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.870
So...

16:41.913 --> 16:44.351
without those pictures--
- We are back to square one.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.309
- Fortunately,
we still have John's ledger.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.050
He keeps a detailed record
of every deal

16:48.094 --> 16:49.051
he's ever made in it.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.661
Years of evidence against him.

16:50.705 --> 16:51.662
- But his office is still
on the seventh floor

16:51.706 --> 16:53.316
of that warehouse.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.926
- Which has probably doubled
its security by now.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.493
- But the sewer system,
that's a good way in.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.060
Those tunnels, they lead
directly to the center

16:58.104 --> 16:59.583
of the building.
- And then we time our entry

16:59.627 --> 17:01.368
for when the guards...
both: Change shifts.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.413
- And then we mosey up the
stairs into Loring's office,

17:03.457 --> 17:04.588
we get the prize.

17:04.632 --> 17:06.242
- Well, you are slick.

17:06.286 --> 17:10.551
- Oh, my God,
Ralph, you found her!

17:10.594 --> 17:12.553
- Oh, technically,
I found him.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.035
- Sue Dearbon.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.340
Hi.
- Hi.

17:17.384 --> 17:18.907
- Cecile Horton.
Meta-human attorney.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.257
But I also have 20 years
of experience

17:21.301 --> 17:22.737
defending non-meta-humans.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.695
The law is my game,
Cecile is my name.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.741
I can cover you no matter
what you've had going on

17:26.784 --> 17:28.047
all this time.
- Just need a quick word.

17:28.090 --> 17:32.181
- Oh, gotcha.
Just one sec.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.096
- Listen, we're--we're--

17:34.140 --> 17:36.272
we're kind of in the middle
of something.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.969
Uh, Sue's been on the run
for the last year.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.189
It turns out that
someone's after her.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.454
And you're her knight
in shining armor?

17:44.498 --> 17:47.066
Ralph, I love it!

17:47.109 --> 17:49.372
By the way, you two?
Hmm.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.201
When I read the both of you
with my powers,

17:52.245 --> 17:54.290
I could barely tell you apart.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.901
Like, emotionally speaking,

17:56.945 --> 18:01.080
you and Sue are definitely
surfing the same wave.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.429
- Just trying to keep her safe.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.474
I mean,
it's not like we're dating.

18:10.306 --> 18:14.136
- I can't believe I didn't
think of this before.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.401
- You would have, eventually.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.024
- What's happening?

18:41.642 --> 18:43.687
- No.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.254
- It should've worked.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.777
- No.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.478
No.

19:04.099 --> 19:07.798
I really thought I was going
back to my old life.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.713
- Eva, you will.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.803
It doesn't even matter anymore.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.982
My sweet Joseph.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.636
We were so in love.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.990
I saw him in the mirror.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.514
I watched him for five years

19:27.557 --> 19:33.084
as he mourned, grieved, and...

19:33.128 --> 19:35.870
moved on.

19:35.913 --> 19:39.178
And I can't--
I--

19:39.221 --> 19:41.615
I can't move on.

20:10.557 --> 20:13.560
- Gah!
- Oh, my gosh. Nash.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.345
- I didn't think anyone else
would be down here.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.348
- I-I lost something
down here, so.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.350
- Oh, right.
Well, that makes sense.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.918
These Starchives
are so massive.

20:23.961 --> 20:26.225
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.445
- I'm sorry, what were you
doing down here?

20:29.489 --> 20:31.752
- Cisco asked me
to hold down the fort

20:31.795 --> 20:33.232
while he, uh--

20:33.275 --> 20:34.581
He wanted me
to take the inventory,

20:34.624 --> 20:36.626
so I gotta do that.
It sucks.

20:36.670 --> 20:37.888
- That's a lie.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.373
- Uh, what are you doing here?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.114
- I lost Nora's journal.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.159
I haven't seen it
for a couple weeks.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.944
And, um...

20:49.987 --> 20:51.728
you know, it's the
only thing I have left

20:51.772 --> 20:53.469
of my daughter, so.

20:53.513 --> 20:57.560
- Ah, must be hard.
- You would know, wouldn't you?

20:57.604 --> 20:59.997
- Now that I think about it,
that's probably--

21:00.041 --> 21:01.912
I am digging up the past,

21:01.956 --> 21:04.132
and, you know, maybe I should

21:04.175 --> 21:07.309
start living in the present.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.789
- So should we all.
- Mm-hmm.

21:08.832 --> 21:11.008
- But it's difficult for you.

21:11.052 --> 21:13.141
Isn't it, Nash?

21:13.184 --> 21:16.275
There's so much
unfinished business.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.928
- Look, Nash.
- Right.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.670
- Barry doesn't know
about this.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.106
He'll be crushed if he knew

21:22.150 --> 21:24.283
that I lost
anything of Nora's, so.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.938
Could you maybe not mention

21:27.982 --> 21:29.592
me being down here?

21:29.636 --> 21:32.943
- Maybe you should mention
why you're down here.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.336
- It'll be our little secret.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.773
- I always knew I liked you.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.500
- Loring's office is right up
those stairs.

22:07.543 --> 22:11.330
Last one there
buys the Gingold.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.809
- Hey!

22:12.853 --> 22:14.855
Freeze!
Stop or we'll shoot!

22:22.950 --> 22:24.647
- At least he's not a pack rat.
- Focus.

22:24.691 --> 22:25.822
- Um...

22:28.434 --> 22:30.174
Not finding it.
- Search faster.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.049
- Think I've got something.
- That's not a ledger.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.356
- No, it's a key
for a safety deposit box

22:37.399 --> 22:39.227
at the CC Mercantile Bank.

22:39.270 --> 22:43.187
Where I'm guessing your ex hid
the ledger for safe keeping.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.060
- Good point.
Time to go.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.023
- Whoa!

22:53.067 --> 22:54.895
Uh, we have a problem.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.854
- Do you trust me?
- Define trust.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.378
- Hang on.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.770
- Are you crazy?

23:00.814 --> 23:02.206
- Sometimes?

23:02.250 --> 23:03.730
Don't let go.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.527
We just--

23:18.571 --> 23:20.964
You just--

23:21.008 --> 23:22.618
You're the Elongated Man?

23:22.662 --> 23:24.881
- Yeah, I'm just
full of surprises.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.933
- How--how did you become

23:32.976 --> 23:35.762
the Elongated Man, anyway?

23:35.805 --> 23:37.111
- I was brutally
experimented on

23:37.154 --> 23:38.982
by a covert organization
for years.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.985
They forced me to consume
rubber-based polymer compounds.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.640
- Seriously?
- No.

23:44.684 --> 23:47.251
- I rode a bus.

23:47.295 --> 23:52.735
- So you're, like,
an honest-to-God superhero.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.171
What's that like?

23:54.215 --> 23:55.434
- It's like any other
job you love.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.915
It's rewarding as hell.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.570
But boy, the hours?
Let me tell you.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.137
- Seriously.

24:03.180 --> 24:06.357
You're like a...

24:06.401 --> 24:07.489
good person.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.664
- I helped you get a key.

24:08.708 --> 24:09.665
It's no ledger.

24:09.709 --> 24:10.927
- Well, Loring's ledger

24:10.971 --> 24:12.799
will definitely be in the box

24:12.842 --> 24:14.322
that goes with this.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.932
- Now we know where the box
is located.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.934
- All we have to do
is open it.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.763
- And then you can get back
to your life.

24:20.807 --> 24:23.462
- Listen...

24:23.505 --> 24:26.290
I want you to know
how much I appreciate you

24:26.334 --> 24:29.380
trusting me with your secret.

24:29.424 --> 24:32.035
It means a lot.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.518
- Uh...

24:36.562 --> 24:38.128
I can call my friends at CCPD

24:38.172 --> 24:40.479
and get a warrant
for Loring's deposit box.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.523
Shouldn't take
more than a day.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.351
- We don't have a day.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.787
Loring's already spooked.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.223
He could move that box
at any minute.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.487
I feel like our
only chance at--

24:48.530 --> 24:49.966
nah, it's too crazy.
- Come on.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.664
Share your thoughts
with the class.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.058
What if...

24:57.191 --> 25:00.020
We break into
CC Mercantile Bank now?

25:00.063 --> 25:01.412
Just us.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.675
And take the ledger
for ourselves.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.328
- Believe that's
called stealing.

25:04.372 --> 25:06.635
- Oh, come on, Slick.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.507
You're also a P.I.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.813
You can't tell me you've always
operated by the book.

25:10.857 --> 25:14.208
- No, but I can't
commit a crime.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.342
- I get it.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.257
And I respect that.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.912
But Ralph,
I'm not a hero.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.697
So if this is
the only chance I have

25:24.740 --> 25:27.700
to see my parents again,

25:27.743 --> 25:30.093
I have to take it.

25:30.137 --> 25:32.095
- Sue...

25:32.139 --> 25:33.532
being a hero,

25:33.575 --> 25:37.057
it's about helping
innocent people.

25:37.100 --> 25:40.016
I'm not gonna let you
do this alone.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.670
- You're not?
- No.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.064
But we do this my way.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.370
We get inside,
get the ledger,

25:46.414 --> 25:49.591
and immediately bring it
to my friends at CCPD.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.420
Deal or no deal?

25:55.075 --> 25:56.642
- Deal.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.212
- So?
What did you find out?

26:02.256 --> 26:03.474
- These scorch marks.
- Mm-hmm.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.780
- They're giant burns like

26:04.824 --> 26:07.217
sunlight through
a magnifying glass.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.698
- So in your expert
CSI opinion--

26:09.742 --> 26:12.440
- The fire was started
by UV light rays.

26:12.483 --> 26:16.444
Same way Dr. Light torched
"The Citizen."

26:17.663 --> 26:19.403
- All right, Joe.

26:19.447 --> 26:20.883
What's going on?

26:20.927 --> 26:23.973
- Look, this isn't
the only file I found

26:24.017 --> 26:27.629
where it looks like something
had fallen through the cracks.

26:27.673 --> 26:31.720
All of these cases involve
accidental deaths.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.243
All the victims are associated

26:33.287 --> 26:35.637
with this guy Joseph Carver.

26:35.681 --> 26:39.249
I'm start to think that
somebody here in CCPD

26:39.293 --> 26:41.600
is helping him cover this up.

26:45.473 --> 26:46.953
- You think
there's a mole here?

26:46.996 --> 26:49.433
- Carver's influence
runs deep, man.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.306
Governors, mayor, CEOs.

26:52.349 --> 26:55.178
- Okay, all right, um,

26:55.222 --> 26:57.964
look, this is what Iris
is already investigating.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.923
Her lead had to do
with the mirror gun

27:00.967 --> 27:03.273
that we stole from McCulloch
Technologies last year.

27:03.317 --> 27:06.102
It fell through because
I wouldn't give it to her.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.495
- Why didn't you
give it to her?

27:07.538 --> 27:08.931
I mean, was it dangerous?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.541
I mean, it could
put her in danger.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.630
Yeah, I don't trust
what the world might do

27:11.673 --> 27:13.109
if that gun got out there.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.676
- Yeah, well,
the world is crazy,

27:14.720 --> 27:17.679
but it's clear that Carver
is really dangerous.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.290
Iris is your partner
and family,

27:20.334 --> 27:22.118
and I don't think
we can trust this right now

27:22.162 --> 27:25.687
with anybody other than family.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.953
- I'm sorry you're not gonna
see your husband again,

27:30.997 --> 27:33.129
but it's easier
if you just accept it.

27:33.173 --> 27:37.699
- Eva, you said that you wanna
go back to your old life.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.920
Look, maybe it's gone,
but you can start a new one.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.663
- I'm glad it's broken.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.971
- I'm glad it's broken.

27:51.017 --> 27:54.803
I'm tired of looking at a world
that doesn't want me anyway.

27:54.847 --> 27:58.807
I'm tired of waiting for
someone to come and rescue me.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.680
And I'm sick and tired of
people

28:01.723 --> 28:04.508
telling me that everything
is gonna be all right.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.336
Because it isn't.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.383
It's never gonna be all right!

28:09.426 --> 28:11.515
Never!

28:20.133 --> 28:23.745
What just happened?

28:23.789 --> 28:26.617
- I think we just found
our way out of here.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.752
- And you're sure
this is necessary?

28:30.796 --> 28:32.711
- A credible tip
came in to CCPD

28:32.754 --> 28:35.844
saying this branch was
a target for robbery, so yes.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.934
- Well, this is the only way
in or out of the vault.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.370
The inner gate is fitted

28:40.414 --> 28:42.111
with an anti-theft
electrical system.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.853
Opening or closing it without
the manager's key

28:44.897 --> 28:47.769
automatically activates
a 50,000 volt fail-safe.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.771
- An electric fence
to keep the cattle in.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.294
- Yeah.
- Smart.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.731
Thanks, pal.

28:54.820 --> 28:58.475
- Sweet Fancy Moses.

28:58.519 --> 29:01.304
- Mmm.

29:01.348 --> 29:05.091
Huh, I understand why people
are grossed out when I do that.

29:05.134 --> 29:06.570
- Your turn, Slick.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.224
- Oh, right.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.754
You know, besides a passion
for fisticuffs

29:15.797 --> 29:17.756
you've got a real knack
for detective work.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.454
You ever think about
getting behind a desk?

29:20.497 --> 29:23.413
- Ugh, that sounds worse
than my boarding school.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.937
Or the times
my parents made me take

29:24.980 --> 29:26.460
horseback riding lessons.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.810
Or learning French
every Saturday

29:28.854 --> 29:32.379
at the US Embassy in Paris.

29:34.860 --> 29:38.820
- Gee, your childhood
sounds just awful.

29:38.864 --> 29:41.780
- I didn't say it was awful.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.913
It just wasn't me.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.436
The truth is,

29:46.480 --> 29:50.092
I always hated
the whole socialite scene.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.703
Which is why, one day,
I woke up and realized

29:52.747 --> 29:55.619
I had no idea who I was.

29:55.663 --> 29:58.797
Guess I still haven't figured
out exactly where I belong.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.451
- Poor little rich girl.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.453
How could she be so lost?

30:03.497 --> 30:07.501
- No, I--
I get it.

30:07.544 --> 30:10.199
I used to wear that uniform
you've got on.

30:10.243 --> 30:13.115
I was a cop.
A damn good one.

30:13.159 --> 30:17.293
And then that ended abruptly,
and I got lost too.

30:17.337 --> 30:21.341
And I rode that bus,
and found where I belong.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.865
- So you're saying
there's hope for me?

30:23.909 --> 30:26.999
- There is from where
I'm standing.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.831
- So, partner.

30:35.355 --> 30:38.662
- It's a big moment.
You mind if I do the honors?

30:38.706 --> 30:41.491
- Of course.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.667
You earned it.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.984
- Found it.
- Must be a tiny ledger.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.856
Now what do you say we get out
of here and play "Mario Kart"--

31:02.904 --> 31:04.253
What the hell?

31:07.735 --> 31:11.043
- I guess you're not the only
one that's full of surprises.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.181
- We are this close
to taking down Loring.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.752
Sue, why are you doing this?

31:24.795 --> 31:27.886
- Who cares about Loring?
I don't even know the guy.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.409
I do, however,

31:29.452 --> 31:31.890
know where
he keeps his valuables.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.939
There never was a ledger.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.462
- Keep going.
- That's why you rented

31:39.506 --> 31:41.595
an apartment in Central City.

31:41.638 --> 31:44.206
You knew I was keeping
tabs on you,

31:44.250 --> 31:47.383
so--
so you lured me in.

31:47.427 --> 31:50.038
You rigged your own apartment
to explode for--

31:50.082 --> 31:51.953
for what?
Just to sell the story of--

31:51.997 --> 31:54.434
of sympathetic socialite
running for her life?

31:54.477 --> 31:56.958
- You bought it.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.134
But don't feel bad.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.744
You're a good guy.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.442
And a hero.

32:02.485 --> 32:04.574
You probably see the best
in everyone.

32:04.618 --> 32:08.143
Me, I see what I want

32:08.187 --> 32:09.971
and I take it.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.407
- You used my detective mind

32:11.451 --> 32:14.410
to track down Loring's
deposit box.

32:14.454 --> 32:17.413
You--you played everyone.

32:17.457 --> 32:21.940
Your parents are desperate
to find you.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.419
Do they even know
what you really are?

32:23.463 --> 32:26.596
- No.
That's our little secret.

32:26.640 --> 32:31.427
If they found out their only
daughter was a thief,

32:31.471 --> 32:33.081
they'd be devastated.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.170
So you keep your mouth shut
about who I am,

32:35.214 --> 32:37.781
I keep mine shut
about who you are.

32:37.825 --> 32:41.089
Deal, Elongated Man?

32:41.133 --> 32:45.137
- Sue, was anything
you told me real?

32:45.180 --> 32:47.443
- Yes.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.792
And no.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.011
See you around, Slick.

33:05.679 --> 33:07.637
CCPD.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.899
You're all under arrest.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.510
- Nice try, officer.

33:10.553 --> 33:13.295
But I have a silent alarm
on my deposit box.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.645
So I know you stole
that from me.

33:17.865 --> 33:19.475
- No phone.

33:19.519 --> 33:20.824
Can't stretch through
these bars

33:20.868 --> 33:23.305
without getting
seriously toasty.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.572
Always come prepared.

33:29.616 --> 33:32.010
- You don't wanna do this.
- Yeah, I do.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.707
I'm that guy.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.027
You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

33:50.550 --> 33:53.031
- Give us a minute.
- Kill 'em both.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.253
- I'm inside you?

33:58.297 --> 33:59.733
Do you have any idea
how disgusting this is?

33:59.776 --> 34:02.170
- I'm saving your life.
- No, you're not.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.563
We are not partners.

34:03.606 --> 34:04.868
I have handled being
shot at before.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.218
- Why does that
not surprise me?

34:06.261 --> 34:08.089
- Let me out.
- Sure, I'll let you out.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.525
And then I'll take you
to Iron Heights

34:09.569 --> 34:11.571
as soon as these idiots
run out of ammo.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.966
- Ugh, do you ever shut up?
Do something.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.794
- I am doing something.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.100
What's your contribution to
this quaint little scenario?

34:19.144 --> 34:20.362
Oh, wait, nothing.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.451
This is all your fault.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.282
- Always come prepared.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.568
- Is there anyone that
doesn't want to kill you?

34:52.612 --> 34:54.266
- Not really.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.232
- I have really gotta
learn Spanish.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.593
- You want the diamond?

35:17.637 --> 35:18.725
Come and get it.

35:36.830 --> 35:40.442
- ♪ Maybe heaven's
got a back door too ♪

35:45.752 --> 35:48.711
♪ Heaven's got

35:48.755 --> 35:53.673

36:11.865 --> 36:14.998
- Looks like
we've both been had.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.658
- She softened him up.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.182
Let's finish the job.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.191
- It's all yours,
Captain West.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.845
- Thanks, Flash.
Clear this out, guys.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.891
- Hey, bud.
- Flash.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.109
- Yeah.
- It's him.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.024
He's the one who robbed us.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.504
- Excuse me?

36:42.548 --> 36:43.940
- That's a case of mistaken
identity, sir.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.334
I'm sure Captain West
can explain.

36:46.378 --> 36:49.555
It's all right.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.383
Hey man, I'm sorry
I got word late,

36:51.426 --> 36:53.733
but I searched the whole area.
Ultraviolet's gone.

36:53.776 --> 36:56.779
Couldn't stop her.
But don't worry, we'll get her.

36:56.823 --> 36:57.867
I promise.

36:57.911 --> 37:01.131
- I wasn't talking about
Ultraviolet.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.747
- Loring's in custody,

37:07.790 --> 37:09.705
but facial recognition
isn't picking her up anywhere

37:09.749 --> 37:11.577
in Central City.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.275
- Looks like Sue Dearbon
has vanished.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.885
Again.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.974
- That's on me.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.106
She played me, Iris.

37:19.149 --> 37:22.544
Like...Coltrane's soprano sax.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.372
- Ralph, you can't beat
yourself up.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.548
I mean, it's not like you knew
who you were dealing with.

37:26.592 --> 37:29.421
- I'm supposed to be
a master detective!

37:29.464 --> 37:31.423
- Ralph, we've all put
our trust in people

37:31.466 --> 37:34.077
who have betrayed us.
God knows I have.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.776
- I'm gonna go tear down
my crime board.

37:40.823 --> 37:44.610
- It's gonna take him a while
to get over this one.

37:45.785 --> 37:49.615
- Hey, Joe told me that you
came by CCPD today.

37:49.658 --> 37:51.399
I think I know why
you didn't come say hi.

38:04.673 --> 38:07.110
- What happened to it
falling into the wrong hands?

38:07.154 --> 38:10.288
- These are the right hands.

38:10.331 --> 38:13.160
Joe and I found evidence
linking Carver's assassins

38:13.203 --> 38:14.596
to more killings.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.512
Crimes that CCPD thought
were accidents.

38:17.556 --> 38:21.690
Black Hole is a lot more
dangerous than I even realized.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.867
But if you can use this in your
investigation in any way

38:24.911 --> 38:26.956
to bring down Carver
and his people faster,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.960
then that's a good thing.

38:31.004 --> 38:35.617
And while I don't
trust the world...

38:35.661 --> 38:37.967
I do trust you.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.969
With everything.

38:45.061 --> 38:47.977
- Thank you.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.464
- You have a connection
to the mirror, even

38:56.508 --> 39:00.512
when it's broken.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.210
- Now who sounds crazy?

39:03.253 --> 39:05.995
- I've seen a lot of strange
things in the last six years.

39:06.039 --> 39:09.042
You being able to control that
mirror is the least of it.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.653
Sam Scudder could even
travel through them.

39:11.697 --> 39:14.177
- Well, I'm not a meta-criminal
who jumps through mirrors

39:14.221 --> 39:15.831
to rob banks.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.703
- I know.

39:17.746 --> 39:19.487
You're much more than that.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.489
We're the only people
in this world, Eva,

39:21.533 --> 39:25.363
so trust me when I say that
you're stronger than you think.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.409
You're a survivor.

39:28.453 --> 39:34.372
Now prove it.

39:40.726 --> 39:43.119
- You did it.
Now keep going.

40:18.590 --> 40:22.115
1,323...

40:41.308 --> 40:43.441
- I'm still with you.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.499
- How did I do that?

41:02.982 --> 41:05.637
- I don't know.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.030
But I promise you,
we will figure it out.

41:49.419 --> 41:52.205
- Game on.

42:15.402 --> 42:16.882
- Greg, move your head.
