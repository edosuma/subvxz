02:08.377 --> 02:10.297
You've seen better days, my lord.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.592
Another visit?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.346
It seems you're my last friend.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.307
No, no, many still love you.

02:21.058 --> 02:25.687
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.566
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

02:29.691 --> 02:31.818
Did you laugh with the others?

02:31.944 --> 02:35.531
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.533
I don't know what you want.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.284
I've given up trying to guess.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.915
When I was still a boy -

02:45.791 --> 02:48.794
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

02:48.919 --> 02:52.381
I travelled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

02:53.966 --> 02:57.010
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.888
The same is true at court.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.266
I am the master of whisperers.

03:02.349 --> 03:06.770
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.856
I'm a good actor, my lord.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.234
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

03:12.317 --> 03:14.361
I could.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.821
But will I?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.282
No.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.367
As I said, I'm no hero.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.244
What do you want? Tell me.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.205
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

03:27.291 --> 03:28.917
Peace.

03:29.001 --> 03:35.090
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.551
Fighting for his father's freedom.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.845
Robb?

03:39.970 --> 03:41.763
He's just a boy.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.099
Boys have been conquerors before.

03:44.183 --> 03:50.772
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.650
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.945
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.450
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

04:03.243 --> 04:08.290
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.919
Cersei is no fool.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.339
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

04:15.464 --> 04:19.009
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

04:19.134 --> 04:20.719
who crippled my son?

04:20.802 --> 04:22.763
I want you to serve the realm!

04:22.888 --> 04:25.599
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

04:25.724 --> 04:27.726
tell your son to lay down his sword

04:27.809 --> 04:31.021
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.109
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.

04:37.069 --> 04:40.989
If you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

04:41.114 --> 04:43.700
I believe she will allow you
to take the black

04:43.784 --> 04:47.329
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.375
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

04:52.918 --> 04:56.213
That I would trade my honour
for a few more years of...

04:56.296 --> 04:57.965
Of what?

05:02.886 --> 05:04.930
You grew up with actors.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.393
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.855
But I grew up with soldiers.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.317
I learned how to die a long time ago.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.114
Pity.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.075
Such a pity.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.334
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

05:34.418 --> 05:36.879
Is that a precious thing to you?

06:18.420 --> 06:21.215
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

06:21.340 --> 06:25.093
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- Keep shooting them down.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.222
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.350
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

06:31.433 --> 06:35.229
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.522
Look.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.484
Father rots in a dungeon.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.694
How long before they take his head?

06:43.695 --> 06:45.822
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.408
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

06:48.534 --> 06:51.453
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.957
Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.751
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

06:57.835 --> 07:01.004
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.340
Have my horse saddled and ready.

07:03.507 --> 07:06.593
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.513
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.269
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.646
Whatever it took.

07:17.729 --> 07:22.317
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.610
I agree.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.822
- I'll go.
- You can't!

07:26.905 --> 07:31.243
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.787
Unless there was a profit in it.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.336
What do you want?

07:41.461 --> 07:45.048
It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.884
Oh, spare me.

07:46.967 --> 07:51.096
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.223
What am I supposed to do with you?

07:53.307 --> 07:56.351
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

07:56.435 --> 08:02.524
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

08:02.691 --> 08:06.403
- Father, please...
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

08:06.528 --> 08:11.950
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.498
All right, you come forward.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.679
There.
Now that I've observed the courtesies,

08:32.804 --> 08:36.183
perhaps my sons will do me the honour
of shutting their mouths.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.524
Is there somewhere we can talk?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.692
We're talking right now.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.240
Fine.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.909
Out! All of you!

09:04.002 --> 09:05.629
- Oh!
- You too.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.180
You see that?

09:15.264 --> 09:17.349
Fifteen, she is.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.268
A little flower.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.814
And her honey's all mine.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.569
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.322
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.366
He is quite ill, my lord.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.536
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.913
Or the one before that.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.542
Your family has always pissed on me.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.545
- My lord, I...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

09:46.628 --> 09:51.091
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.094
- I'm sure there were reasons...
- I didn't need reasons.

09:54.219 --> 09:58.932
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.479
Why are you here?

10:06.690 --> 10:08.150
To ask you...

10:08.275 --> 10:10.527
to open your gates, my lord...

10:11.403 --> 10:15.157
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.327
- Why should I let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

10:18.452 --> 10:21.955
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.459
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.878
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.422
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

10:30.547 --> 10:33.383
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.802
You swore an oath to my father.

10:35.886 --> 10:39.014
Oh, yes, I said some words.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.309
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.686
Joffrey's king now,

10:44.770 --> 10:49.441
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

10:51.276 --> 10:55.364
If I had the sense the gods gave a fish,
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

10:55.447 --> 11:00.369
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

11:01.745 --> 11:06.250
Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?

11:07.042 --> 11:09.044
And... engage!

11:11.338 --> 11:14.383
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

11:14.466 --> 11:16.677
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.514
You'll be ready for this, then.

11:20.639 --> 11:25.352
I thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

11:26.728 --> 11:29.898
so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.694
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.373
This is Valyrian steel.

11:48.125 --> 11:52.045
It was my father's sword,
his father before him.

11:52.171 --> 11:55.591
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.718
It was meant for my son Jorah.

11:58.552 --> 12:03.557
He brought dishonour to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

12:03.640 --> 12:05.893
before he fled from Westeros.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.063
- My lord, you honour me, but I can't...
- Oh, you can.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.899
And you will.

12:11.982 --> 12:15.903
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.739
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.453
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.289
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.957
Right.

12:29.041 --> 12:34.963
Now, don't think this means I approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

12:35.047 --> 12:38.592
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.929
I'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.

12:42.054 --> 12:45.474
No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

12:45.599 --> 12:49.603
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

12:49.728 --> 12:52.981
I've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

12:53.106 --> 12:54.983
boy king.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.945
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

12:58.904 --> 13:04.117
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.828
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

13:06.954 --> 13:09.289
and bring me my supper.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.999
Yes, my lord.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.888
- Well done.
- Well done.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.642
You earned that, Snow.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.648
Well done.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.571
Go on, let's have a look.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.990
- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.

13:43.073 --> 13:46.034
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

13:46.076 --> 13:49.371
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

13:54.668 --> 13:56.295
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.301
Come on,
I want to have a look at it in the light.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.181
Give it here!

14:07.306 --> 14:09.183
What is it?

14:09.266 --> 14:11.310
- I...
- Look at its eyes.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.978
- Give it.
- I can't.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.564
You can't what?

14:15.647 --> 14:16.857
I...

14:18.609 --> 14:21.153
I'm really not supposed to say.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.906
And yet you really want to say.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.991
You want to say that...?

14:29.328 --> 14:32.080
There was a raven.

14:32.164 --> 14:34.082
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

14:36.502 --> 14:38.337
It's your brother Robb.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.214
What?

14:40.297 --> 14:41.882
What about him?

14:43.258 --> 14:44.843
He's heading south.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.762
To war.

14:48.931 --> 14:52.809
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.230
I should be there.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.900
I should be with him.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.042
If we do that, they'll never get back across.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.587
Well?

15:20.712 --> 15:22.381
What did he say?

15:23.715 --> 15:26.051
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.098
- His men are yours, as well.
- Huh.

15:31.223 --> 15:34.977
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.436
What does he want in return?

15:36.562 --> 15:40.816
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.777
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.406
And?

15:48.699 --> 15:50.576
And Arya...

15:50.659 --> 15:54.496
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.291
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.504
And?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.673
And...

16:06.175 --> 16:07.968
when the fighting is done...

16:10.262 --> 16:12.431
you will marry one of his daughters.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.517
Whichever you prefer.

16:15.601 --> 16:19.021
He has a number
he thinks will be... suitable.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.023
I see.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.194
Did you get a look at his daughters?

16:25.319 --> 16:26.695
I did.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.156
And?

16:30.574 --> 16:32.075
One was...

16:38.081 --> 16:39.750
Do you consent?

16:40.709 --> 16:43.462
- Can I refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.634
Then I consent.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.640
Sam said you wanted to see me?

17:36.765 --> 17:39.142
I did indeed.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.229
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

17:45.524 --> 17:50.904
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

17:51.029 --> 17:54.074
take no wives and father no children?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.868
No.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.703
So they will not love.

17:58.579 --> 18:02.249
Love is the death of duty.

18:02.332 --> 18:06.170
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

18:06.253 --> 18:08.589
between honour on the one hand...

18:08.672 --> 18:11.175
I
and those he loves on the other

18:11.258 --> 18:12.551
what would he do?

18:13.427 --> 18:17.764
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.019
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.730
Most of us are not so strong.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.441
What is honour...

18:27.608 --> 18:30.277
compared to a woman's love?

18:30.402 --> 18:32.779
And what is duty...

18:32.863 --> 18:36.450
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

18:36.533 --> 18:38.911
Or a brother's smile?

18:43.457 --> 18:44.791
Sam told you.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.919
We're all human.

18:47.044 --> 18:50.255
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

18:50.339 --> 18:53.133
Honour comes easy then.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.718
Yet...

18:54.801 --> 18:56.762
sooner or later...

18:56.845 --> 18:58.805
in every man's life...

18:58.889 --> 19:01.934
there comes a day when it is not easy.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.103
A day when he must choose.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.982
And this is my day?

19:09.066 --> 19:11.151
Is that what you're saying?

19:11.318 --> 19:14.363
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

19:14.530 --> 19:17.366
- I know.
- You do not know.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.245
No one knows.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.998
I may be a bastard,

19:25.123 --> 19:27.626
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

19:31.922 --> 19:36.176
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.303
They waited till I was old.

19:39.805 --> 19:43.809
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

19:43.976 --> 19:46.353
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.355
I was helpless...

19:48.981 --> 19:51.775
blind, frail.

19:53.652 --> 19:55.529
But...

19:55.654 --> 19:59.116
when I heard they had
killed my brother's son...

19:59.199 --> 20:01.285
and his poor son...

20:01.451 --> 20:02.828
and the children!

20:02.953 --> 20:05.247
Even the little children.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.001
Who are you?

20:11.128 --> 20:14.923
My father was Maekar,

20:15.007 --> 20:17.134
the first of his name.

20:17.259 --> 20:21.513
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

20:21.597 --> 20:24.474
when I had refused the throne.

20:24.641 --> 20:28.020
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

20:28.103 --> 20:31.064
whom they called the Mad King.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.816
You're Aemon Targaryen.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.613
I'm a maester of the Citadel,

20:37.696 --> 20:41.909
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

20:44.912 --> 20:48.957
I will not tell you... to stay or go.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.628
You must make that choice yourself...

20:52.753 --> 20:55.964
and live with it for the rest of your days.

20:59.843 --> 21:00.969
As I have.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.449
[Khal anni...]
My lord...

21:22.616 --> 21:25.077
[Shekh ma shieraki anni...]
My sun and stars...

21:27.746 --> 21:29.248
Drogo.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.966
[Sajo anni.]
My Horse.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.302
[Sajo... anni.]
My... Horse.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.221
[Qoy qoyi...]
Blood of my blood...

21:44.388 --> 21:48.267
[Vos, anha'th dothrak]
No, I must ride.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.270
[Me arthas hrazefoon mae.]
He fell from his horse.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.440
[Khal fini laz vos dothrao, vos khal.]
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.807
[Me haqa, vos ale. Me zigeree mithrat.]
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

21:58.819 --> 22:03.146
[Kisha ray hezhahish chek asshekh. Kisha avimithreraki jinne.]
We've ridden far enough today. We will camp here.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.367
[Jinne vos gache vimithrerat.]
This is no place to camp.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.819
[Chiori vos assoo kisha. Vos Khaleesi akka.]
A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.

22:08.829 --> 22:12.865
[Kisha avimithreraki jinne. Asti morea me Khal Drogo asso moon.]
We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

22:12.875 --> 22:15.636
[Shafka vos assoo anna zhey Khaleesi.]
You do not command me Khaleesi.

22:16.295 --> 22:18.829
[Ezi Mirri Maaz Duur. Fichi mae anhaan.]
Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.

22:18.839 --> 22:21.456
[Maegi? Anha afichak shafkea nharees zhey Khaleesi.]
The witch? I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

22:21.466 --> 22:27.266
[Fichi mae anhaan ozisa che Khal Drogo achara kifindirgi yer ziganeso anhaan.]
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you defied me.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.314
Hyah! Hyah!

22:56.001 --> 22:59.755
Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

22:59.922 --> 23:02.216
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

23:02.341 --> 23:04.843
They're a day's march north.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.346
The boy may lack experience and sense,

23:07.471 --> 23:09.932
but he does have a certain mindless...

23:10.974 --> 23:13.602
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

23:17.022 --> 23:19.233
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.735
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

23:21.860 --> 23:23.904
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

23:24.029 --> 23:27.407
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battle axes.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.993
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

23:30.077 --> 23:31.912
Shagga likes axes.

23:32.079 --> 23:36.750
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

23:36.834 --> 23:38.418
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

23:38.544 --> 23:41.171
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

23:41.255 --> 23:43.632
They do seem rather ferocious.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.928
Ferocious?

23:48.053 --> 23:52.766
Last night... a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

23:52.891 --> 23:56.603
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.368
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

23:59.439 --> 24:03.609
which was fortunate, but even still
Ulf is demanding blood money,

24:03.694 --> 24:06.321
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.575
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

24:09.658 --> 24:13.203
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

24:13.287 --> 24:15.664
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

24:21.003 --> 24:23.297
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.965
Excuse me, my lords.

24:38.562 --> 24:41.190
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

24:41.315 --> 24:43.442
- I took her.
- Took her?

24:44.067 --> 24:46.612
- From whom?
- From, uh...

24:46.695 --> 24:48.530
Ser... What's his name?

24:49.907 --> 24:54.494
- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

24:55.996 --> 24:57.873
He said something.

25:00.334 --> 25:05.714
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

25:05.839 --> 25:08.091
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

25:11.053 --> 25:12.888
Oh, well.

25:14.306 --> 25:18.310
I, uh...
think I'll go and find myself one.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.316
Who are you?

25:24.441 --> 25:26.777
Who would you like me to be?

25:26.860 --> 25:28.570
What did your mother call you?

25:28.654 --> 25:31.782
Shae. What did your mother call you?

25:31.907 --> 25:34.243
My mother died giving birth to me.

25:34.952 --> 25:37.996
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

25:38.914 --> 25:41.416
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.168
For...

25:45.045 --> 25:46.505
What do you want from me?

25:47.172 --> 25:49.383
What do I want from you?

25:49.466 --> 25:52.469
I want you to share my tent.

25:52.553 --> 25:55.556
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

25:55.681 --> 25:58.225
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

25:59.017 --> 26:02.396
I want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

26:02.479 --> 26:07.067
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

26:07.192 --> 26:09.194
Which it may well be.

26:09.278 --> 26:10.863
And what do I get?

26:10.988 --> 26:12.573
One - safety.

26:14.032 --> 26:16.743
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

26:17.870 --> 26:20.539
Two - the pleasure of my company,

26:20.622 --> 26:23.250
which I have heard is spectacular.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.544
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

26:25.627 --> 26:27.212
And three...

26:28.088 --> 26:31.383
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

26:33.177 --> 26:35.345
Do you accept my proposal?

26:54.281 --> 26:57.242
Let's start with your last night in this world.

27:30.067 --> 27:31.610
Khaleesi.

27:31.693 --> 27:32.736
Come.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.282
He's very strong.

27:37.366 --> 27:40.118
No one understands how strong he is.

27:59.429 --> 28:02.140
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

28:02.975 --> 28:04.893
He can't. I won't let him.

28:05.018 --> 28:08.105
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

28:10.983 --> 28:14.236
We must go quickly.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

28:14.361 --> 28:18.407
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

28:18.532 --> 28:20.492
Doth...

28:20.617 --> 28:22.327
Even if...

28:24.371 --> 28:25.831
Even if he dies...

28:27.082 --> 28:28.375
why would I run?

28:29.543 --> 28:34.089
I am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

28:34.214 --> 28:37.342
This isn't Westeros, where men honour blood.

28:37.426 --> 28:42.055
Here they only honour strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

28:42.181 --> 28:44.892
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

28:44.975 --> 28:47.019
He won't want any rivals.

28:47.144 --> 28:51.857
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

28:52.983 --> 28:55.694
I won't... leave him.

29:05.913 --> 29:07.414
The wound has festered.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.501
[Yer et jin zhey maegi.]
You did this witch.

29:10.626 --> 29:12.419
[Nakhi]
Stop it!

29:12.503 --> 29:14.161
[Anha vos zalok meme nem azzisa.]
I don't want her hurt.

29:14.171 --> 29:19.384
[Vos? Vos? Hash shafka vos zali meme nem azzisa?]
No? No? You don't want her hurt?

29:19.968 --> 29:27.351
[Zali mekisha vos azzisaki shafka akka. Shafka azh jin maegaan frakhat khales kishi.]
Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

29:27.434 --> 29:31.220
[Javrathi lekh. Me zin Khaleesi shafki.]
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.

29:31.230 --> 29:34.870
[Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.]
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

29:37.986 --> 29:41.990
[Affin me drivoe, me vosi.]
When he dies, she is nothing.

29:46.954 --> 29:53.085
[Anha vosoon avvos. Anha qoy zhavvorsi.]
I have never been nothing. I am the blood of the dragon.

29:54.753 --> 30:00.592
[Ei zhavvorsa drivi, zhey Khaleesi.]
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.644
I think you should wear
your armour tonight, ser.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.438
I think you're right.

30:18.735 --> 30:22.656
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.992
He's beyond the healer's skills.

30:25.075 --> 30:27.494
All I can do is ease his path.

30:27.578 --> 30:29.788
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

30:31.081 --> 30:33.000
You must know a way.

30:33.584 --> 30:34.835
Some...

30:36.211 --> 30:37.546
Some magic.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.341
There is a spell.

30:42.384 --> 30:44.720
Some would say death is cleaner.

30:54.646 --> 30:56.315
Do it.

30:57.149 --> 30:58.901
Save him.

30:59.026 --> 31:01.820
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

31:01.945 --> 31:04.198
It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

31:04.323 --> 31:06.325
Only death pays for life.

31:09.828 --> 31:11.371
My death?

31:11.455 --> 31:14.249
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.628
Bring me his horse.

31:41.151 --> 31:42.903
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

31:42.986 --> 31:46.323
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

31:46.406 --> 31:49.368
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

31:49.451 --> 31:53.080
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

32:03.590 --> 32:04.800
Go. Now.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.802
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

32:06.927 --> 32:08.095
Take her!

32:13.934 --> 32:17.896
You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.566
The dead will dance here tonight.

32:33.954 --> 32:35.664
No one will enter.

32:43.922 --> 32:46.258
Bring him back to me.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.443
What have you done?

33:04.526 --> 33:06.820
I have to save him.

33:06.904 --> 33:10.199
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

33:10.282 --> 33:12.282
You would have been safe.

33:18.498 --> 33:20.667
[Jini'th vos eo.]
This must not be.

33:20.751 --> 33:22.111
[Jini'th vos eo.]
This must not be.

33:22.169 --> 33:23.670
[Jini vee.]
This must be.

33:23.795 --> 33:25.005
[Maegi.]
Witch.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.280
[Mra qothoon vosaan...]
Nothing good will come of this.

33:27.299 --> 33:28.967
[Vos! Yer laz vos.]
No, you can't.

33:29.051 --> 33:30.969
Khaleesi!

33:32.429 --> 33:34.806
[Vos alle, zhey vezhak.]
No further, horselord.

34:15.681 --> 34:16.806
Are you hurt?

34:16.931 --> 34:17.891
- The baby...
- Hmm?

34:18.016 --> 34:19.643
...is coming.

34:19.768 --> 34:23.563
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

34:25.023 --> 34:27.150
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

34:28.443 --> 34:32.072
The witch - she can bring baby.
I hear her say so.

34:55.512 --> 34:57.181
Are you in agony, my lion?

34:57.306 --> 34:59.683
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

35:00.601 --> 35:03.228
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

35:06.857 --> 35:08.483
Ah!

35:10.194 --> 35:12.779
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

35:12.863 --> 35:14.948
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

35:17.201 --> 35:19.077
Let's play a new game.

35:20.579 --> 35:23.165
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you.

35:23.248 --> 35:26.376
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

35:26.502 --> 35:29.004
- Not if you win.
- No!

35:29.129 --> 35:31.673
No fire games, no knife games.

35:32.591 --> 35:36.637
- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?

35:36.678 --> 35:38.639
I happen to be a great judge of character.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.974
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

35:41.099 --> 35:45.187
Here's how it works -
I make a statement about your past.

35:45.312 --> 35:48.440
If I'm right, you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

35:48.524 --> 35:51.443
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

35:51.568 --> 35:53.362
I don't want to play this game.

35:53.529 --> 35:55.447
Fine. Bronn first.

36:00.077 --> 36:01.912
Your father beat you.

36:07.543 --> 36:09.545
But my mother hit harder.

36:13.006 --> 36:15.509
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

36:15.592 --> 36:17.386
It was a woman.

36:20.722 --> 36:22.015
She swung an axe at me.

36:23.809 --> 36:25.394
You've been north of the Wall.

36:28.772 --> 36:30.482
What brought you up there?

36:32.109 --> 36:33.861
- Work.
- And...

36:34.987 --> 36:38.365
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

36:38.490 --> 36:40.284
so you've never let yourself love again.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.454
Oh, wait, that's me.

36:47.749 --> 36:50.502
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

36:50.586 --> 36:52.171
I don't want to play.

36:52.254 --> 36:56.049
It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

36:59.595 --> 37:01.638
Your mother was a whore.

37:02.639 --> 37:03.849
Drink.

37:10.397 --> 37:12.524
All right.

37:12.608 --> 37:16.028
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

37:16.153 --> 37:17.279
Drink.

37:18.530 --> 37:21.366
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

37:24.703 --> 37:26.288
Mm.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.334
You wanted a different life.

37:30.459 --> 37:33.170
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

37:33.295 --> 37:35.964
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

37:36.006 --> 37:38.133
So, specifics...

37:38.300 --> 37:41.762
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

37:41.845 --> 37:45.641
I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

37:45.766 --> 37:49.436
So... what's a low-born girl to do?

37:53.065 --> 37:54.316
Drink.

37:57.194 --> 37:58.904
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

38:04.493 --> 38:08.288
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

38:08.372 --> 38:10.916
or I will carve your eyes from your head.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.298
My dear lady,
if I have offended you, I apologise.

38:19.508 --> 38:20.425
My turn.

38:20.592 --> 38:22.636
Fine, fine.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.221
Ask away.

38:25.055 --> 38:28.016
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

38:28.058 --> 38:31.061
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

38:31.144 --> 38:33.522
I don't care the way the game works.

38:33.647 --> 38:35.607
Our lord here used to be married.

38:36.567 --> 38:38.652
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

38:38.819 --> 38:42.114
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

38:44.658 --> 38:46.243
Another night, perhaps.

38:47.411 --> 38:49.413
Not another night. This night.

38:50.956 --> 38:52.583
It's not a pleasant story.

38:54.585 --> 38:56.128
Oh, maybe I will cry.

38:56.211 --> 39:00.757
I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your Lordship.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.970
So...

39:08.348 --> 39:14.062
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding,
when we heard a scream.

39:14.188 --> 39:18.692
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

39:18.775 --> 39:23.280
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while I wrapped her in my cloak.

39:23.405 --> 39:25.199
She was too scared to send off on her own,

39:25.324 --> 39:30.287
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

39:30.495 --> 39:32.831
Her name was Tysha.

39:32.998 --> 39:35.167
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

39:35.250 --> 39:37.461
And she was hungry.

39:37.544 --> 39:40.839
Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

39:40.964 --> 39:45.135
Impossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.

39:45.177 --> 39:48.347
I forgot how afraid I was around girls...

39:48.472 --> 39:51.850
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

39:51.975 --> 39:53.185
look away embarrassed,

39:53.352 --> 39:56.063
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

39:56.146 --> 39:58.524
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

39:59.775 --> 40:02.569
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

40:02.694 --> 40:05.572
For three chickens, I should hope so.

40:05.656 --> 40:08.742
It didn't last long.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

40:08.825 --> 40:11.203
But she was good to me.

40:11.245 --> 40:13.288
She kissed me afterwards and...

40:14.289 --> 40:15.791
San9 me a SOn9.

40:17.376 --> 40:20.921
And by morning
I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.299
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

40:24.341 --> 40:26.552
and there you have it - man and wife.

40:27.886 --> 40:32.599
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

40:32.683 --> 40:35.227
Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.

40:35.269 --> 40:36.812
Not quite.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.941
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

40:43.068 --> 40:45.070
The girl was a whore, you see.

40:46.697 --> 40:51.785
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers... all of it.

40:51.910 --> 40:54.371
He thought it was time I had a woman.

40:56.456 --> 40:58.542
After my brother confessed...

40:59.835 --> 41:01.712
my father brought in my wife

41:01.837 --> 41:03.755
and gave her to his guards.

41:05.257 --> 41:08.010
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

41:08.093 --> 41:11.013
How many whores command
that kind of price?

41:12.890 --> 41:16.310
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

41:16.393 --> 41:19.730
By the end, she had so much silver

41:19.897 --> 41:24.568
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

41:28.488 --> 41:31.450
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

41:32.409 --> 41:34.536
You should have known she was a whore.

41:35.412 --> 41:36.455
Really?

41:37.331 --> 41:39.833
I was 16, drunk and in love.

41:39.917 --> 41:45.255
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

41:46.340 --> 41:49.927
As I said, I was young and stupid.

41:52.554 --> 41:54.848
You are still young and stupid.

42:18.622 --> 42:20.457
Hyah!

42:37.099 --> 42:40.519
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

42:40.644 --> 42:43.397
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.023
They're a mile north.

42:45.774 --> 42:48.235
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

42:50.696 --> 42:52.573
If I die, weep for me.

42:53.991 --> 42:56.910
You will be dead.
How will you know?

43:03.625 --> 43:05.169
I'll know.

43:07.421 --> 43:08.922
Watch out! Move!

43:10.090 --> 43:11.675
Out of the way!

43:11.758 --> 43:13.677
Move aside!

43:20.100 --> 43:21.602
Stay low.

43:22.603 --> 43:24.146
Stay low?

43:24.229 --> 43:26.607
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.525
I was born lucky.

43:31.737 --> 43:34.072
Tribesmen of the Vale,

43:34.156 --> 43:35.490
gather round!

43:37.201 --> 43:39.620
Stone Crows!

43:39.703 --> 43:41.914
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

43:41.997 --> 43:44.666
- Moon Brothers!
- And Painted Dogs!

43:44.708 --> 43:47.586
- And Painted Dogs!
- Painted Dogs!

43:47.669 --> 43:50.589
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

43:50.714 --> 43:53.509
Onward, to claim what is yours!

43:53.675 --> 43:55.719
Half man! Half man!

43:55.844 --> 43:59.181
Half man! Half man!

43:59.264 --> 44:01.850
Half man! Half man!

44:02.017 --> 44:03.852
To battle!

44:46.436 --> 44:47.896
You're a shit warrior.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.818
I'm alive?

44:53.777 --> 44:55.320
You're alive.

45:00.742 --> 45:02.327
Did we win?

45:02.494 --> 45:05.122
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

45:18.177 --> 45:20.554
How did our tribesmen do?

45:21.972 --> 45:24.141
Yeah, good.

45:25.184 --> 45:29.479
- It's nice to see them getting along.
- You're wounded.

45:30.689 --> 45:32.608
Good of you to notice.

45:33.483 --> 45:34.776
I hear we won.

45:34.902 --> 45:37.446
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

45:38.280 --> 45:41.200
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.

45:42.242 --> 45:44.411
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

45:44.494 --> 45:45.954
He wasn't here.

45:46.830 --> 45:48.540
Where was he?

45:48.624 --> 45:51.001
With his other 18,000 men.

45:54.713 --> 45:56.840
And where are they?

46:06.934 --> 46:08.894
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

46:14.233 --> 46:15.651
My lady!

46:17.861 --> 46:20.072
Hyah! Hyah!

46:51.186 --> 46:55.357
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

46:58.777 --> 47:02.823
Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,
but I seem to have lost it.

47:02.948 --> 47:04.867
It is not your sword I want.

47:06.326 --> 47:07.995
Give me my daughters back.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.955
Give me my husband.

47:10.789 --> 47:12.541
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

47:12.666 --> 47:15.127
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

47:15.210 --> 47:20.048
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

47:20.132 --> 47:23.218
Take him away and put him in irons.

47:23.343 --> 47:25.846
We could end this war right now, boy,

47:25.971 --> 47:27.973
save thousands of lives.

47:28.098 --> 47:30.976
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

47:31.101 --> 47:33.061
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

47:33.187 --> 47:36.899
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

47:39.401 --> 47:41.528
If we do it your way, kingslayer...

47:42.613 --> 47:44.323
you'd win.

47:47.451 --> 47:48.994
We're not doing it your way.

47:50.871 --> 47:52.748
Come on, pretty man.

48:01.673 --> 48:06.512
- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

48:06.637 --> 48:09.640
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

48:16.647 --> 48:19.358
One victory does not make us conquerors.

48:21.193 --> 48:23.278
Did we free my father?

48:24.279 --> 48:26.782
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

48:28.242 --> 48:31.870
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

48:37.334 --> 48:39.503
This war is far from over.

49:10.826 --> 49:12.411
Could I have one?

49:12.494 --> 49:14.329
A lemon one... or any of them.

49:14.413 --> 49:16.081
Three coppers.

49:16.874 --> 49:20.544
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

49:21.628 --> 49:24.464
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

49:24.548 --> 49:26.091
Piss off!

49:33.390 --> 49:35.475
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

49:35.559 --> 49:37.769
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

49:37.895 --> 49:39.813
The Hand of the King.

50:47.297 --> 50:49.466
- Traitor!
- Coward!

50:49.508 --> 50:51.593
Baelor.

50:51.677 --> 50:52.928
Baelor!

50:58.684 --> 51:01.353
Traitor! Traitor!

51:21.498 --> 51:23.667
I am Eddard Stark...

51:23.792 --> 51:25.794
Lord of Winterfell...

51:25.878 --> 51:28.255
and Hand of the King.

51:37.472 --> 51:39.933
I come before you to confess my treason...

51:41.101 --> 51:43.020
in the sight of gods and men.

51:45.022 --> 51:46.690
I betrayed the faith of my king...

51:47.774 --> 51:49.818
and the trust of my friend Robert.

51:51.236 --> 51:53.697
I swore to protect and defend his children.

51:54.656 --> 51:56.700
But before his blood was cold...

51:57.701 --> 52:00.495
I plotted to murder his son...

52:00.621 --> 52:03.081
and seize the throne for myself.

52:13.550 --> 52:19.389
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say...

52:22.309 --> 52:24.520
Joffrey Baratheon...

52:25.354 --> 52:27.773
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

52:28.482 --> 52:31.276
by the grace of all the gods,

52:31.401 --> 52:33.654
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

52:33.737 --> 52:35.906
and Protector of the Realm.

52:43.372 --> 52:45.290
As... as we sin...

52:46.124 --> 52:47.793
so do we suffer.

52:47.876 --> 52:50.963
This man has confessed his crimes...

52:51.046 --> 52:53.549
in sight of gods and men.

52:54.174 --> 52:56.802
The gods are just...

52:56.927 --> 53:00.389
but beloved Baelor taught us...

53:00.556 --> 53:02.975
they can also be merciful.

53:06.436 --> 53:10.524
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

53:15.404 --> 53:18.490
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

53:18.615 --> 53:23.954
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

53:24.079 --> 53:28.125
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

53:32.880 --> 53:35.215
But they have the soft hearts of women.

53:36.550 --> 53:38.468
So long as I am your king...

53:38.594 --> 53:41.388
treason shall never go unpunished.

53:42.472 --> 53:43.682
Ser Ilyn...

53:44.975 --> 53:46.143
bring me his head!

53:46.226 --> 53:48.353
No!

53:48.437 --> 53:50.314
Someone stop him!

54:01.617 --> 54:03.577
My son, this is madness.

54:04.494 --> 54:05.829
Put him down!

54:13.170 --> 54:15.506
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

54:15.631 --> 54:18.175
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

54:18.300 --> 54:20.761
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

54:20.886 --> 54:22.763
- No! No!
- Traitor!

54:22.846 --> 54:24.181
