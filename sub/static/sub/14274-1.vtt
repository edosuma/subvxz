03:36.717 --> 03:40.052
Good evening, everyone, and welcome
to Houston, the Energy City,

03:40.053 --> 03:42.173
home of the defending
Rollerball World Champions.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.684
This key international battle pits
divisional champions, visiting Madrid,

03:46.685 --> 03:48.310
against powerful Houston.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.329
And here they come for
a standing ovation.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.373
On the track comes Houston.

04:09.374 --> 04:14.670
Houston, led by captain Jonathan E.,
again their leading scorer this year.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.374
Jonathan! Jonathan!

04:32.647 --> 04:35.225
Okay, right there. Let's go.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.538
The controller indicates
that he is ready,

04:49.539 --> 04:51.874
and our 30 Multivision
cameras will be bringing you

04:51.875 --> 04:54.585
all the speed, thrills and
excitement of this critical game.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.507
Ladies and gentlemen,
our corporate anthem.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.846
The controller tests his
computerized equipment,

06:28.847 --> 06:30.514
readies for the start
of game action.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.059
The traditional firing of the test ball
will signal we're about set to go.

06:37.397 --> 06:41.860
The controller for tonight's
game, D.A. Niehaus.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.778
The officials have given their
approval for play. Each team...

06:44.779 --> 06:46.614
Come on, man.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.616
And now the crowd cheers once again

06:48.617 --> 06:53.287
as this Houston audience greets its team
led by the storied athlete Jonathan E.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.582
Corral's gonna break off.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.377
Okay, boys! Okay.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.125
Houston! Houston!

07:21.107 --> 07:23.605
Now the play-by-play. Here's RD.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.156
The computer counts down,
one second, the ball...

07:29.157 --> 07:31.906
First period is underway
here in Houston tonight.

07:33.745 --> 07:37.206
The first team to pick up the ball will
be on offense as they try for the score.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.042
And it's a pickup by Houston.
It's picked up by BJ.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.085
Yay!

07:41.086 --> 07:42.544
BJ moves it around the track.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.588
He'll try to maneuver for
the leading score...

07:44.589 --> 07:46.173
Go on, go on.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.626
Watch it!

07:53.765 --> 07:55.391
Jonathan E. holds the ball aloft.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.686
He must hold it out in
plain view at all times.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.061
Pick them up! Pick them up!

07:59.062 --> 08:00.889
I got them! I got it!

08:01.523 --> 08:04.442
On your right! On your
right! Now, baby!

08:09.739 --> 08:12.282
Jonathan moves up the track
and up on to the side.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.243
Here comes Sanchez for Madrid.

08:14.244 --> 08:18.163
Sanchez grabs Jonathan from behind,
but off the rail comes Moonpie

08:18.164 --> 08:20.207
and takes out four Madrid men.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.127
The old swooper, Moonpie,
with his favorite maneuver,

08:23.128 --> 08:26.798
made a move from the top of the
rail and took out four Madrid men.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.552
The remaining Madrid skaters set up
their defense in front of the goal.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.261
Jonathan still has the ball.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.806
Moving in, he'll try to cover
the slot, and surely does!

08:35.807 --> 08:38.510
Jonathan in front, shoots,
and it's just wide!

08:38.518 --> 08:39.765
Regroup!

08:40.145 --> 08:42.020
The Houston team will
have to regroup.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.817
Injured on the play is Belmonte, and
he's helped off the track for Madrid.

08:46.651 --> 08:50.981
First period, no score, as we get set
for the firing of the second ball.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.124
Oh, and it hits the biker Carter!

09:02.125 --> 09:03.709
Knocks Carter down...

09:03.710 --> 09:05.210
Give me a hand. Move out!

09:05.211 --> 09:07.087
Come on, look alive!

09:20.560 --> 09:24.980
Jonathan is there, it is handed off,
the pass is complete to Jonathan.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.075
He skates by and
knocks him down again!

09:36.076 --> 09:37.534
Did you see that penalty?

09:37.535 --> 09:40.204
And the officials look this over...

09:43.041 --> 09:44.333
Keep up. Keep up.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.251
Moon, on your left. On your left.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.955
Right, right, right. I got him!

09:54.094 --> 09:56.386
Break it up! Break it up!

09:56.387 --> 09:58.009
Go, Jonathan, go!

09:59.015 --> 10:00.849
Here comes Houston for the
first goal of the game.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.267
He shoots, he scores!

10:02.268 --> 10:03.560
Yeah!

10:04.479 --> 10:08.524
And at the end of the first period,
Jonathan's goal gives Houston

10:08.525 --> 10:10.567
a one-to-nothing lead over Madrid.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.070
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.821
The time, first period, 12 minutes.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.623
The ball is fired for the
start of the second period.

10:24.624 --> 10:29.295
Madrid trailing by one goal, trying
to go on offense to tie the score.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.253
Go, Madrid!

10:36.719 --> 10:38.053
Watch your left!

10:39.180 --> 10:40.264
Who did it?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.558
Coming around the track...
Come on, Madrid, come on.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.685
Inside of the bike, he
skates up in front.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.270
Gonzales still has it for Madrid.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.397
Hands off again,
this time to Bodeas.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.226
Bodeas on offense for
the Madrid team.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.652
Here's the Houston defense
in a four-man defense...

10:53.653 --> 10:55.404
Shot! It is cleared.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.239
And out of the pack goes Bodeas,

10:57.240 --> 11:00.200
but he's all right, he's not injured,
but his scoring attempt failed.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.412
And the score is still
one-to-nothing in favor of Houston.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.291
The ball is fired again. Madrid is
pressing now, putting the pressure on...

11:07.292 --> 11:09.039
Keep it moving!

11:12.255 --> 11:14.332
All right, come on, let's move it.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.043
We got it now.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.936
Sanchez is moving to
his left and right,

11:27.937 --> 11:31.690
has a full head of steam, still going
in on offense, trying to tie the score.

11:31.691 --> 11:36.153
Sanchez moves around the bike, takes a
long look and shoots and he scores!

11:36.154 --> 11:40.154
Sanchez scores with a play
that ties the game at 1-1.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.783
Second period.

11:41.784 --> 11:45.079
The ball is in play again,
intercepted this time by Haskell.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.540
Three minutes. Get off.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.462
Madrid penalty.

11:53.463 --> 11:58.760
Three minutes, biking misconduct
on number one, Meitzer.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.006
Are you satisfied, Madrid? What kind of
game are you guys playing out there?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.657
Take it easy, take it easy.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.533
You'll be okay.

12:23.534 --> 12:28.706
This crowd's going wild, loving the
wide-open action in this quarterfinal game.

12:28.707 --> 12:29.790
Skate! Skate!

12:29.791 --> 12:32.085
Come on, God damn it, skate!

12:34.963 --> 12:37.416
Houston! Houston!

12:42.345 --> 12:44.388
All go down, pileup on the track,

12:44.389 --> 12:47.557
the ball rolls free and into the
gutter. It's a dead ball.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.560
Come here, come here!

12:50.561 --> 12:52.729
Come on, block that side.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.396
Come on, move out.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.063
How is it, Jonathan?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.323
- Give me a tie, will you, Bo?
- Sure.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.656
Come on, dude!

13:24.721 --> 13:26.054
Three minute penalty. Hey!

13:27.348 --> 13:30.097
Don't give me any of that.
Off the track. Off the track.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.313
Group up.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.947
Hold the line! Hold the line!

13:43.948 --> 13:47.075
Up and over the Madrid defense,
gets up in front of the goal

13:47.076 --> 13:49.779
and he jams it in for the score!

13:50.163 --> 13:55.785
Jonathan jams it in and scores to
get Houston a 2-1 lead over Madrid.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.626
Houston with the ball again
here in the third period.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.301
Stop it!

14:11.809 --> 14:12.934
He has it.

14:12.935 --> 14:16.438
Jonathan behind the bike, coming in low with
a great maneuver, he shoots, he scores!

14:18.441 --> 14:20.317
That's the way! You got it!

14:20.318 --> 14:22.778
I love this game,
Moonpie. I love it.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.945
Yeah.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.158
So, we've got two games left.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.657
Guess who we play first? Tokyo.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.375
Now who would have thought
they'd make it to the playoffs?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.210
They're good.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.295
They've got the old samurai spirit.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.089
Yeah, but they're
only about this tall.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.300
Yeah, well, two or three little
things make one big thing.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.719
They're liable to climb all
over you and eat your lunch.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.220
I can't get on a man-to-man basis
with a pigmy or an oriental.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.186
I don't know what it is.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.853
You were fine tonight, all of you.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.531
Mean. Sharp.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.657
Thank you.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.950
Your fellas did well again.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.827
Thank you, Mr. Bartholomew, sir.
Thank you.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.077
You? You rode. You really rode.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.289
Yeah.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.000
You play like our champion here.
You take lessons from him?

15:19.001 --> 15:21.711
No. We just give lessons
to the other team.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.710
Yeah!

15:24.006 --> 15:25.503
How are you, Jonathan?

15:25.550 --> 15:29.010
I'm feeling mean, Mr. Bartholomew.
It's good to see you.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.805
Jonathan E. That's the name.

15:33.015 --> 15:37.686
Houston players come and go,
but the champion plays on.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.646
Yeah!

15:39.647 --> 15:41.648
The corporation has a
hard time, Moonpie,

15:41.649 --> 15:44.477
figuring out ways to pay
the champion properly.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.987
We can't think up any
more rewards for him.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.573
You'd like us to have that
problem with you, wouldn't you?

15:49.574 --> 15:50.699
Yes, sir.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.872
Like Jonathan, you play with abandon,
but this is Jonathan's season.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.125
Every season seems to
be Jonathan's season,

16:00.126 --> 16:03.211
but this year, we've got
you on Multivision.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.006
A special show all about you.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.509
No player ever had that before.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.131
The whole world will be watching,
because this is your year.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.930
You got it, babe.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.855
So, two games left.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.231
That's right, Mr. Bartholomew.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.108
New York in the final!

16:28.529 --> 16:30.652
Team seems healthy,

16:30.740 --> 16:32.908
champion says he feels mean,

16:34.535 --> 16:36.077
no problems here.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.451
What is this, fruit juice?

16:41.751 --> 16:44.545
Very healthy, Mr. Bartholomew,
very healthy.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.219
Sweet dreams, Moonpie.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.551
It's a bad habit you got there.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.855
You know what that habit will
make you dream, Moonpie?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.108
You'll dream you're an executive.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.653
And you'll have your hands
on all the controls,

17:09.654 --> 17:13.700
and you'll wear a gray suit,
and you'll make decisions.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.571
But you know what, Moonpie?

17:16.117 --> 17:21.074
You know what those executives dream
about out there, behind their desks?

17:21.624 --> 17:24.452
They dream they're
great rollerballers.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.711
They dream they're Jonathan.

17:26.712 --> 17:30.215
They have muscles,
they bash in faces.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.971
Let's go. Can't keep these
boys here all night.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.641
Jonathan, come and see me tomorrow.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.524
Quiet, boys, quiet.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.227
This is a great team.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.280
A great city. Great stuff
out there tonight.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.312
Jonathan! Jonathan!

19:37.718 --> 19:38.968
- Good morning.
- How are you, sir?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.261
Brutal game last night.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.846
Oh, thank you.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.318
Continue to hold my calls,
all right? Thank you.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.133
Come in, Jonathan.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.928
Keep silence with me for
a minute, won't you?

20:59.508 --> 21:02.803
It's important to have a
place to think things out.

21:02.887 --> 21:07.263
You have your ranch. I know you
take a lot of pleasure in it.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.015
I, uh, cut my finger.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.346
I'm sorry. Here.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.068
You've had an amazing
career, Jonathan.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.030
You know how proud we are
of the Houston team,

21:22.031 --> 21:24.734
and what we think
of you, the energy?

21:25.534 --> 21:29.409
But now, there are
executives who want you out.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.705
Sir?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.416
You've had 10 years in
this game, Jonathan.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.585
Longer than anyone, ever.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.588
Retire? How can I do that?

21:38.589 --> 21:40.712
On your special program.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.886
There are some who feel that
this program should now be used

21:44.887 --> 21:47.510
to announce your retirement.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.307
Who wants that?

21:49.308 --> 21:54.105
When this special was first planned by
RCI Energy, we saw it as a good thing.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.267
Now the executive
directorate wants a change.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.109
The program is scheduled, the
whole world is waiting for it,

22:02.488 --> 22:05.908
so this does seem the perfect time.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.787
You know, the team, they,
uh, they depend on me.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.867
Jonathan, let's think
this through together.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.911
You know how a game serves us?

22:17.920 --> 22:20.464
It has a definite social purpose.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.175
Nations are bankrupt, gone,

22:24.844 --> 22:27.547
none of that tribal
warfare anymore.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.475
Even the corporate wars
are a thing of the past.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.269
I know that. It's just...

22:34.270 --> 22:37.522
So now, we have the majors
and their executives.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.859
Transport, food, communication,

22:40.860 --> 22:43.813
housing, luxury, energy.

22:44.363 --> 22:48.193
A few of us making decisions
on a global basis

22:48.325 --> 22:49.993
for the common good.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.828
The team, is a unit.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.454
It plays with certain rhythms.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.124
So does an executive
team, Jonathan.

22:56.125 --> 23:00.125
Now, everyone has all the
comforts, you know that.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.332
No poverty, no sickness,

23:03.465 --> 23:05.713
no needs and many luxuries,

23:06.260 --> 23:10.385
which you enjoy just as if you
were in the executive class.

23:10.472 --> 23:14.225
Corporate society takes
care of everything,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.311
and all it asks of anyone,

23:16.312 --> 23:19.436
or has ever asked of anyone, ever,

23:19.815 --> 23:22.768
is not to interfere with
management decisions.

23:23.444 --> 23:26.821
I know. I don't mean to resist.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.615
I'm just trying to understand.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.909
This is for your own benefit.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.328
You must know that, Jonathan.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.873
All decisions concerning you are.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.711
Well, I, uh, lost Ella.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.423
The corporation took my wife away
because an executive wanted her.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.383
I'm not gonna review
all that again.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.546
It was before I took over here,
and I had nothing to do with it.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.679
And from what I hear, your
wife wanted to leave herself.

23:54.850 --> 23:58.054
So, now you're going to retire.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.477
That shouldn't be too hard for you.

24:01.899 --> 24:05.273
It's a stupid game,
after all. Awful game.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.167
You ought to be glad
to be out of it.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.401
I don't...

24:13.827 --> 24:17.031
I don't know, Mr. Bartholomew.
I just don't know.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.209
I realize you had nothing
to do with Ella leaving...

24:21.210 --> 24:23.162
- Jonathan, I...
- But, um...

24:25.297 --> 24:27.090
You're right.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.419
I mean, I ought to do it.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.387
I ought to be perfectly
happy to do what you say...

24:32.388 --> 24:36.092
Take your time. Take a few days.

24:36.934 --> 24:40.263
You've just come through
a game. You're tired.

24:40.562 --> 24:44.312
Go to your ranch,
but think about it,

24:44.984 --> 24:47.186
and understand it.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.280
Do understand it.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.428
Because I don't understand
your resistance,

25:13.429 --> 25:16.382
and I don't think anyone
else will, either.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.530
Was your flight okay?

26:14.531 --> 26:15.656
Yeah. Is Clete here?

26:15.657 --> 26:16.741
He's in the training room.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.865
I'm gonna go say hello.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.781
- Jonathan.
- Hmm?

26:23.165 --> 26:25.208
Look what I got for breakfast.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.292
Hmm?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.711
It's a notice from the corporation.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.789
What's it say?

26:31.215 --> 26:33.838
Oh, that I should get out of here.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.637
You know, go away, vanish.
That kind of thing.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.874
You know anything about that?

26:41.391 --> 26:44.344
Yeah, I kind of heard
something about it.

26:45.687 --> 26:46.979
You knew it was coming.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.519
We've been together six months.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.315
Didn't you even want
to say goodbye?

26:57.991 --> 26:59.909
We'll talk about it later, okay?

26:59.910 --> 27:01.862
You didn't, did you?

27:02.371 --> 27:03.618
Hmm?

27:05.624 --> 27:08.668
You didn't even want me
here when you got back.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.545
I gotta go see Cletus.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.505
What do you want me to
do in the meantime?

27:12.506 --> 27:14.003
I want you to take it easy.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.001
Uh...

27:17.136 --> 27:20.054
I want you to go in and
fix us something to eat.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.225
Clete's come a long
way and I'm hungry.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.935
All right?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.429
Okay.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.439
Jonathan?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.898
I'm glad you're all right.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.214
Come on. All right, come on.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.794
Come.

28:03.265 --> 28:04.682
I'm tired enough.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.556
Yeah. Uh-huh. Well...

28:22.492 --> 28:24.535
- I caught you, didn't I, baby?
- Huh?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.287
- Two games running.
- What?

28:26.288 --> 28:28.164
You did that in the last two games.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.124
Show the forward left.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.460
You're standing on your left skate.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.796
Do that in Tokyo, they'll
take your arm home for lunch.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.298
You with me?

28:37.299 --> 28:40.173
Okay.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.553
You practice that a
little for me, huh?

28:42.554 --> 28:43.880
All right.

28:51.146 --> 28:54.520
Hell, I forget which
corporation is which.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.194
Any ass knows that fire's energy.

28:58.487 --> 29:03.534
What about the music? Where's
the music come from, huh?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.202
Okay if I have one of these?

29:06.203 --> 29:07.662
Go on, have all of it.

29:19.925 --> 29:23.129
I forget what corporation's
running what city.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.924
Chicago's still a food city,

29:29.268 --> 29:31.562
but what about Indianapolis?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.210
Whatever happened to that town?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.227
Whatever happened to Mackie?

29:36.441 --> 29:39.318
Yeah, things were much
simpler when I was a kid.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.896
We still had three nations.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.448
That was before the corporate
wars, even before rollerball.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.866
Before everything.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.702
You believe in kids?

29:48.245 --> 29:49.870
I remember someone telling me about

29:49.871 --> 29:53.120
the National Football
League and the World Cup.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.417
Where you going?

29:54.418 --> 29:56.086
Indianapolis.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.967
What do you know about
that stuff, Clete?

30:02.968 --> 30:04.545
I mean...

30:05.137 --> 30:09.262
Know how the corporations got
started, about the corporate wars?

30:09.599 --> 30:11.676
They were nasty! Whoo!

30:12.144 --> 30:14.186
But nobody talks about that.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.938
Well, except among friends.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.641
Yeah.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.360
I remember your rookie year.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.112
You were mean and tight.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.361
Best player I ever coached.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.615
Nobody could lay a
hand on you that year.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.404
- Remember?
- Yeah.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.247
Look, I... I gotta
ask you something.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.871
It figures. Go ahead.
I'm listening.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.752
Well...

30:37.753 --> 30:40.297
Something going on with the game.

30:41.548 --> 30:45.469
I don't know what it is. I don't
think I'm supposed to know.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.844
What's that?

30:47.554 --> 30:49.552
They want me to quit.

30:58.315 --> 31:01.394
And why would they
want you to do that?

31:02.069 --> 31:03.819
I don't know.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.569
That's what I'd like
you to find out.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.408
I can try.

31:08.617 --> 31:12.571
Hear just about everything going
on in the game one way or another.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.622
That's what I mean.

31:14.623 --> 31:17.167
I can't think of another
executive who'd tell me a thing.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.421
Well, like I say, I'll...

31:23.757 --> 31:25.209
I'll try.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.302
But I don't think there's much I...

31:28.303 --> 31:29.970
Look...

31:29.971 --> 31:31.806
No troubles for
either of us, Clete.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.475
Just find out what you can.

31:35.268 --> 31:38.096
Well, trust me, Jonathan,
you know you can.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.681
Sure.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.146
Sit down.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.270
Yeah.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.091
Nice, boys.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.515
Yo, Johnny.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.396
That's the Houston stride.

32:25.068 --> 32:28.654
You boys want to make this team, play for
Houston, you're gonna have to learn it.

32:28.655 --> 32:32.576
We pride ourselves on
being a power team.

32:32.701 --> 32:33.826
That's right.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.786
We're power. We're mean.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.038
Now, that doesn't mean to say

32:38.039 --> 32:42.209
we'd like to have you hanging back
there on a rail, in a fistfight,

32:42.210 --> 32:44.044
just standing there fighting
somebody in section A

32:44.045 --> 32:45.588
when you're supposed
to be in section B.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.757
I'm coming up to score, and you ain't in
the section you're supposed to be in,

32:48.758 --> 32:50.050
don't do us no good.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.218
Right.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.717
Who's the two new catchers here?

32:54.264 --> 32:55.598
Right.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.472
Give me that ball.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.305
Don't, uh.

33:02.355 --> 33:05.149
Stick your hand in
that gutter too quick.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.648
Wait till this ball comes
down on the track.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.406
Don't get too anxious. That thing
will take your arm right off.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.950
Now, the bikers.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.660
A biker

33:17.537 --> 33:20.661
might sacrifice a little
three-minute penalty

33:20.707 --> 33:22.875
and run over the top of a skater...

33:22.876 --> 33:24.543
Uh-huh.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.985
If he feels that he's skating
a little too good that day.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.298
So we have a few methods
here in Houston.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.424
There's hundreds.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.551
One, of course, is to
use this shield here.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.929
Use your pads. Use what you got.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.764
Drive that arm in there.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.599
Keep your feet forward.
Hit and move.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.683
You get away from the wreck.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.102
Always keep your feet here.
Don't come across in here.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.438
You get all twisted. That's sad.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.273
Or if a biker's sitting
up nice and high...

33:46.274 --> 33:47.983
A lot of guys like to ride high.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.360
Drag one off them in there.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.778
I hurt you, Blue?

33:50.779 --> 33:53.232
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.282
Now, third method,

33:55.283 --> 33:59.324
kind of one that was perfected by a
little friend of mine, the swoop.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.832
Swooper, that's me.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.960
Hang up on the rail, use all
the speed of the track,

34:05.961 --> 34:08.208
come down and drop-kick a biker.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.168
Say, excuse me.

34:13.677 --> 34:16.847
You're not paying a whole
lot of attention, are you?

34:18.514 --> 34:19.875
Hey, what's this dude's name?

34:20.225 --> 34:22.768
That's our new
speedball from Manila.

34:22.768 --> 34:25.016
Yeah, you know.
You know, that's Toughie.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.768
Come on up, Tough.

34:29.775 --> 34:31.068
Always a big honker.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.782
Say, why don't you do me
and the boys a favor,

34:36.783 --> 34:39.702
I mean, since you know
everything there is to know...

34:39.703 --> 34:42.161
We'd sure appreciate it, I want you
to give us a little demonstration.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.789
Show us how you made
that big rep down there.

34:43.790 --> 34:47.369
Just skate around and
just take me out, huh?

34:52.382 --> 34:53.629
Go get him, Toughie.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.847
Now, eyes, use them.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.724
Don't lock your eyes
on any one spot.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.183
This game isn't all in the muscle.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.226
Use your head.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.055
Lock your eyes on
the target, keep...

35:09.691 --> 35:12.943
Ears, now, they're
real important, too.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.502
If there's anything I love,
it's luxury centers.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.838
When I get my privilege card,
I know what I'm gonna get me, too.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.051
Secretary.

35:37.052 --> 35:40.220
Why do you want a secretary?
Are you planning on becoming an executive?

35:40.221 --> 35:42.097
I just need one.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.424
About this tall.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.476
Yeah?

35:46.519 --> 35:48.062
Why don't you give it a rest?

35:55.904 --> 35:56.987
Hello.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.072
Can I help you, please?

35:58.073 --> 36:01.241
Yeah, I tried to order some books,
and they sent me this notice

36:01.242 --> 36:03.786
said I had to appear at
the center personally.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.121
That's right. This is
our circulation unit.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.199
You can make your choice
here or by catalog.

36:09.459 --> 36:10.751
There must be some mistake.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.294
The books you've
ordered are classified

36:12.295 --> 36:15.130
and have been transcribed
and summarized.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.378
Well, who summarizes them?

36:16.424 --> 36:19.047
I suppose the computers
summarize them.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.095
What'd you need books for?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.930
Just want to study
up on some things.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.431
You could go to the computer center

36:24.432 --> 36:26.600
where the real librarians
transcribe the books,

36:26.601 --> 36:29.269
but we have all the edited
versions in our catalog.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.972
Anything I think you'd want.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.399
Well, let's see then.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.820
This is not a library, and you
are really not a librarian.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.612
I'm only a clerk. That's right.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.072
I'm sorry about it really.

36:40.073 --> 36:43.742
And the books are really in
computer banks being summarized.

36:43.743 --> 36:44.910
Where is that?

36:44.911 --> 36:47.121
Well, there's a computer
bank in Washington.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.915
The biggest is in Geneva.
It's a nice place to visit.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.917
- Yeah.
- I guess that's where all the books are now.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.415
Yeah. Well, thank you.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.299
It's not that exactly.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.218
Yeah, but books, Jonathan?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.845
I mean, anything you want to know,

37:02.846 --> 37:05.264
you could hire yourself a
corporate teacher, see?

37:05.265 --> 37:09.101
I mean, you can call somebody up.
Use your privilege card.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.521
I can't. That's just it.

37:11.980 --> 37:16.316
I feel there's something going on.
Somebody's pushing me.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.144
Who? Bartholomew?

37:19.821 --> 37:21.947
But you're Jonathan E.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.992
Everybody knows you.
You've got everything.

37:25.994 --> 37:29.619
You know you'll be treated right.
You always have been.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.624
Yeah. I don't know.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.877
But I do know! We're living good.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.705
You know we are.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.960
I found this to wear.

40:26.341 --> 40:27.667
Is it all right?

40:30.845 --> 40:32.718
That's the uniform of the house.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.683
I'm Daphne.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.733
Yeah. That figures.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.155
Well, that's all right.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.867
Here. Wear these, too.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.336
That's right, no penalties!

41:04.337 --> 41:07.547
Limited substitutions.
You can handle it!

41:07.548 --> 41:09.383
Beat Tokyo!

41:09.384 --> 41:11.218
All we gotta do is
change our tactics.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.095
- That's it.
- Three times...

41:13.096 --> 41:15.722
There's always been rule changes.
Now, look, you know that!

41:15.723 --> 41:18.475
It gets more people to watch the
game. That's all there is to it.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.562
Look, you all signed contracts
to finish out the season,

41:22.563 --> 41:24.856
no matter what the
alterations in the game.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.234
Now every last one of you signed.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.902
See? Now we all signed a contract.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.780
That doesn't matter! There's
no way we're gonna lose,

41:31.781 --> 41:33.323
no matter how they change the game.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.572
That's right. That's right.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.954
All it means is a
change of strategy.

41:38.955 --> 41:41.623
Now, we knock out the bikers early,
we take care of their skaters.

41:41.624 --> 41:44.623
Don't try to score yourselves.
And the game's yours.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.795
Now, you watch
yourselves out there.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.672
They're playing the
same rules we are.

41:48.673 --> 41:52.926
It's gonna be rough, but it's
still basically the same game.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.387
And the team with the power wins.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.968
Come on.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.017
Hey, Rusty.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.526
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.944
Hey, Rusty, come on.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.647
Listen.

42:13.114 --> 42:15.487
You were talking about
them contracts.

42:16.075 --> 42:19.494
How come everyone else is being asked
to play with the no-penalty rule,

42:19.495 --> 42:21.993
and they're pressuring me to quit?

42:23.416 --> 42:25.084
I don't know.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.293
But can't you do what you're told?

42:30.673 --> 42:32.500
For your own good, get out.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.419
I...

42:36.137 --> 42:37.804
I don't want to leave
the guys to play Tokyo

42:37.805 --> 42:39.097
with the rules breaking
down. I mean...

42:39.098 --> 42:42.017
Jonathan, it doesn't
matter what you want!

42:45.855 --> 42:47.682
Think about that.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.743
These we did in slow motion

42:59.744 --> 43:02.788
to show the impact of your
blows on opposing players.

43:03.456 --> 43:04.664
Yeah, fine.

43:04.665 --> 43:07.459
We want you to approve
the sequences.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.037
It's, uh...

43:09.295 --> 43:11.589
It's all fine with me.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.207
Anything.

43:13.633 --> 43:16.468
I really don't see
why I'm needed here.

43:16.469 --> 43:19.304
Well, the Energy people
want you to be satisfied.

43:19.305 --> 43:20.388
Huh.

43:20.389 --> 43:23.433
There, now, isn't that
a marvelous shot?

43:25.061 --> 43:26.228
Sure.

43:26.229 --> 43:29.899
I'm a stat freak myself.
Isn't that perverse?

43:30.525 --> 43:31.897
You got anything I can take?

43:34.028 --> 43:36.105
Just... Just take one.

43:37.698 --> 43:39.032
Statistics, huh?

43:39.033 --> 43:43.078
Yes, the greatest number of points
scored in a single game, 18.

43:43.079 --> 43:45.997
The highest velocity of a ball
when actually fielded by a skater,

43:45.998 --> 43:47.958
120 miles per hour.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.376
Most deaths...

43:50.503 --> 43:52.797
Please, don't do that.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.048
Oh.

43:55.049 --> 43:59.511
Most deaths, nine. Rome versus
Pittsburgh. December, last year.

43:59.512 --> 44:01.721
The greatest number of
players and substitutes

44:01.722 --> 44:06.268
put out of action by a single
player in a single game, 13.

44:06.269 --> 44:09.439
A world's record, courtesy
of your dear self.

44:09.772 --> 44:12.774
There have been studies, you know,
of stat freaks in rollerball.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.192
Well, some go to the track,

44:14.193 --> 44:16.570
but they never take their
eyes off the big board.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.071
What's this?

44:18.072 --> 44:19.614
As for myself, I've always wondered

44:19.615 --> 44:22.944
if a rollerball player sees
himself as a class apart.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.371
"Hello. Pause.

44:27.331 --> 44:30.034
"I'm Jonathan E. Smile.

44:32.003 --> 44:35.753
"I would like..." Is this for me?

44:35.756 --> 44:38.425
Very astute, yes.

44:38.426 --> 44:41.049
It's your retirement announcement.

44:41.762 --> 44:45.056
Your special is already scheduled
and announced all over the world.

44:45.057 --> 44:48.227
You're supposed to read this
as part of the program.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.558
What sort of pill did you give me?

44:50.730 --> 44:53.558
Pure aphrodisiac, Daph.
Enjoy yourself, dear.

44:53.733 --> 44:56.568
Can we finish up there and go home?

44:56.569 --> 44:58.945
You are being recorded.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.781
Feeling a little woozy, are you?
Try to read the announcement.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.484
I'm all right.

45:04.952 --> 45:08.455
Why don't you read... the...

45:08.456 --> 45:10.954
Oh, you... You want that, do you?

45:11.626 --> 45:13.376
You are making things
very difficult...

45:13.377 --> 45:16.797
How many... How many
assignments you been on, Daph?

45:18.132 --> 45:20.842
I know you're good at
what you're good at,

45:20.843 --> 45:22.966
so, you must have been around some.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.805
A lot of girls have stayed
with me but you know that.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.758
Never seem to mind.

45:28.851 --> 45:33.147
But odd thoughts I've had about
you, Daph, odd thoughts.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.558
I wondered if you'd
been briefed on me.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.147
I'm going to have to
ask you to read...

45:37.151 --> 45:39.819
Yeah, a lot of things occurred
to me, Daph, a lot of things.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.180
A lot of things occur to you?

45:44.075 --> 45:45.948
You look terrible.

45:46.494 --> 45:48.492
You do look terrible.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.782
Come on.

45:54.460 --> 45:57.671
See, you shouldn't take anything
offered to you just like that.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.419
What was in it?

45:59.757 --> 46:01.633
Nothing to hurt you.

46:01.634 --> 46:04.344
Maybe you're just a little too trusting.
You ever think of that?

46:27.660 --> 46:29.533
And hook 'em deep now!

46:45.177 --> 46:46.469
I'll do that.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.013
Thank you.

46:54.895 --> 46:58.065
As you know, the Tokyo
game is coming up.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.942
And you'll remember
that the Tokyo team

47:00.943 --> 47:04.989
uses various karate and
hapkido techniques.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.700
We will review these techniques

47:08.701 --> 47:11.119
with special attention to
the use of death blows.

47:11.120 --> 47:12.787
Same lecture every year.

47:15.041 --> 47:17.460
There are certain body areas

47:18.419 --> 47:20.667
that the skilled opponent
will endeavor to strike...

47:20.755 --> 47:22.297
What we got for our
skilled opponents

47:22.298 --> 47:24.424
is the old Houston
fist-in-the-face technique.

47:24.425 --> 47:25.550
Right?

47:27.011 --> 47:29.213
Especially in a game
with no penalties...

47:29.263 --> 47:31.556
You got to get mad,
all right? Play hard!

47:31.557 --> 47:33.600
It don't matter that they're all
tiny little men on that team.

47:33.601 --> 47:38.022
Especially in a game with no
penalties and limited substitution.

47:38.105 --> 47:39.978
Get mad and fly!

47:40.858 --> 47:42.025
Please...

47:42.026 --> 47:44.611
Now, there's certain body
areas that I know about, too.

47:44.612 --> 47:47.190
Now, what we gotta do is hit
those guys in the ganglion.

47:47.406 --> 47:48.531
Where?

47:48.532 --> 47:49.616
In the ganglion.

47:49.617 --> 47:51.618
It's a mess of nerves
right here under the ear.

47:51.619 --> 47:54.913
Now, what you gotta do is drive the
jawbone up in that mess of nerves

47:54.914 --> 47:56.115
and it rings a bell.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.668
You must understand.

48:00.461 --> 48:03.880
The Tokyo team has a very
eccentric playing style.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.131
And no penalties, all right?

48:05.132 --> 48:06.966
If I go down, I know
my team is with me!

48:06.967 --> 48:08.635
- Right?
- Please...

48:08.636 --> 48:09.837
Brute speed!

48:09.929 --> 48:13.473
Familiarize yourself with the
basic fighting art techniques.

48:13.474 --> 48:15.975
And nobody is gonna take
us, rules or no rules!

48:15.976 --> 48:17.143
Go on. Go on.

48:17.144 --> 48:19.096
This is the Houston team!

48:19.271 --> 48:20.480
Rules or no rules!

48:20.481 --> 48:22.103
We fight for each other!

48:22.149 --> 48:24.351
Houston! Houston!

49:34.847 --> 49:38.927
They're really quite beautiful
in a wild kind of way.

49:39.351 --> 49:41.352
I can almost smell the lions.

49:41.353 --> 49:43.772
Don't be silly.
They're made in Detroit.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.274
Yes, they're androids.
They're all programmed.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.776
That's right. The whole
game is played by robots.

49:48.777 --> 49:50.945
They look like men, and they...

49:51.739 --> 49:54.158
Not so loud. They'll hear you.

49:56.243 --> 49:58.661
It'll ensure stability,
expansion and high profits

49:58.662 --> 50:00.538
for the planetary enterprise.

50:00.539 --> 50:01.748
What do you think about it?

50:01.749 --> 50:04.918
Exciting. You make it sound
absolutely romantic.

50:04.919 --> 50:08.254
He's gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.

50:08.255 --> 50:10.298
I know and he's so intelligent.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.383
We're practically
living on krypens.

50:16.388 --> 50:18.135
Hey, there he is.

50:18.224 --> 50:20.600
Hey, Johnny boy. Hey, kid!

50:22.811 --> 50:25.480
Come on, well,
let's hear it! Come on.

50:46.961 --> 50:48.586
Give me a hand here.
Give me a hand, will you?

50:48.587 --> 50:50.380
Behave yourself.

51:12.987 --> 51:14.689
Hello, Mackie.

51:16.532 --> 51:18.484
Well, how you been?

51:20.202 --> 51:22.621
You know, it's your night
tonight, Jonathan.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.581
You having a good time?

51:24.582 --> 51:25.999
Well...

51:26.667 --> 51:28.119
Well, I'm glad you're here.

51:29.128 --> 51:31.376
I'm here with an executive.

51:34.133 --> 51:36.210
He asked all about you.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.422
He wanted to know if I enjoyed you.

51:57.781 --> 51:58.990
Hey, Rocky.

51:58.991 --> 52:00.658
Hey, come here and give me a hand.

52:00.659 --> 52:03.157
Get on over here.
There's too many of them.

52:04.788 --> 52:06.372
Well, what about the new game?

52:06.373 --> 52:08.207
Actually, I haven't
heard much about it.

52:08.208 --> 52:10.001
The rule changes were
announced a week ago.

52:10.002 --> 52:12.045
- That so?
- Who changed them?

52:12.046 --> 52:13.588
That's what I've been
trying to find out.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.923
Look, rules or no rules,
it's still the same game.

52:15.924 --> 52:18.092
What I'm really looking
forward to is the program.

52:18.093 --> 52:20.219
When you see that screen
replay afterwards...

52:20.220 --> 52:21.471
Excuse me.

53:20.698 --> 53:21.781
Did you hear about Evans?

53:21.782 --> 53:22.907
What?

53:22.908 --> 53:24.781
He's out. Gone.

53:25.411 --> 53:26.988
No kidding.

53:27.162 --> 53:28.784
The old man?

53:29.123 --> 53:30.745
Who got him?

53:31.291 --> 53:33.914
- What?
- I said who got him?

53:34.545 --> 53:36.247
The Crocodile.

53:48.434 --> 53:49.600
Hey. do you like poetry?

53:49.601 --> 53:51.053
Mmm-hmm.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.354
Let's go upstairs?
I got a poem for you.

53:53.355 --> 53:54.556
Ooh.

54:11.331 --> 54:14.167
Welcome, sports
enthusiasts everywhere.

54:14.168 --> 54:16.169
Tonight, Multivision
trains its cameras

54:16.170 --> 54:18.998
on the amazing career
of Jonathan E.

54:19.548 --> 54:22.175
In those years that Houston
began to mold itself

54:22.176 --> 54:25.303
into a world championship team with the
attacking style of their lead scorer...

54:25.304 --> 54:26.846
Jonathan, come on.
Come on, come on.

54:26.847 --> 54:30.597
Jonathan E., has always been
the team's strongest asset.

54:30.642 --> 54:34.187
Yes, the game seems
invented for him.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.251
Defense! Defense!

56:20.252 --> 56:23.672
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

56:48.989 --> 56:50.156
Right on!

57:16.892 --> 57:18.809
Look, I talked to
everybody I could.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.187
And there is something going on.

57:21.188 --> 57:23.272
Yeah, you... You're
right about that.

57:23.273 --> 57:26.226
Nobody will talk about it.
I mean nobody!

57:26.485 --> 57:29.946
It's hard finding anything out,
Jonathan. You know that.

57:29.947 --> 57:34.860
Hell, nobody even knows the names of
the men on the directorate anymore.

57:40.707 --> 57:42.750
Look, I'm sorry, I...

57:46.213 --> 57:47.880
They want you out. You know that.

57:47.881 --> 57:49.173
Yeah.

57:49.925 --> 57:52.378
Well, do you know who they are?

57:53.470 --> 57:54.595
Bartholomew, I guess.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.013
Mmm-mmm.

57:56.223 --> 57:58.096
Above Bartholomew.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.302
It's the Executive Directorate.

58:01.311 --> 58:02.937
Why are they worried about me?

58:02.938 --> 58:04.105
It's what they do.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.356
They're even after the old man

58:05.357 --> 58:08.026
because he didn't get your
retirement announced tonight.

58:09.236 --> 58:11.237
How come they put the
program on without it?

58:11.238 --> 58:15.113
I think they had to. They didn't
want to. It's very tricky.

58:17.577 --> 58:21.577
Jonathan, look... There's one
thing you ought to know.

58:22.457 --> 58:24.580
Look, nobody said it,

58:24.668 --> 58:26.461
but I'm sure of it.

58:26.670 --> 58:27.871
Hmm.

58:31.049 --> 58:33.547
They're afraid of you, Jonathan.

58:34.428 --> 58:36.972
All the way to the top, they are.

58:49.609 --> 58:52.062
What are they afraid of me for?

59:10.797 --> 59:13.295
Oh, no. Don't go yet.
We're showing some replays.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.301
Well, let's see 'em then.
Let's see 'em.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.982
Mr. Bartholomew would like to see
you now. He's in the study.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.426
Come on hurry up. Over there.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:55.819
You know I've always considered
your situation, Jonathan.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.774
And your needs.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.774
Now, you have to consider mine.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:02.738
And ours.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.743
I'm considering it,
Mr. Bartholomew.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:07.743
No player is greater
than the game itself.

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:10.666
It's a significant game
in a number of ways.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:14.750
The velocities of the ball, the
awful physics of the track.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:19.209
In the middle of it all, men,
playing by an odd set of rules.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:23.301
It's not a game men are supposed
to grow strong in, Jonathan.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.681
You appreciate that, don't you?

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.600
More and more, Mr. Bartholomew.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.894
Shoot that statue.
That's the one. Shoot that!

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:38.944
Hey...

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.022
- The tree!
- Yeah! Come on!

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.738
You must take good advice.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:49.206
You're not to play against
Tokyo, you're not to play again.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:51.957
I want some concessions.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.410
Concessions!

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.045
Believe me, I'd be happy
to talk a deal, Jonathan.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.498
I love deals.

01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:01.256
But this situation is
much, much simpler.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:04.846
This Multivision event tonight
was very embarrassing.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.097
For me and for others.

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:08.515
Well...

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:14.272
it might be I won't ever find out why
I've been asked to leave the game.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:18.518
But I do know I can get some
concessions and I want them.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.826
Oh, you missed!

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.119
I want to see Ella. My wife.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:37.545
Arrange it so I can see her again.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:39.380
That's not easy, Jonathan.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:42.585
I want other concessions,
too, Mr. Bartholomew.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.437
Oh! Oh-ho! Look at that!

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.855
Give...

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.412
By my life, that's incredible!

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.207
- Oh!
- That's terrific.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.785
Look at all those flames!

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.585
Specifically, you're bargaining

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:22.131
for the right to stay in a
horrible social spectacle.

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:26.758
It has its purposes, and you've
served those purposes brilliantly.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.135
Why argue when you can quit?

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:32.933
And you say you want to know
why decisions are made.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.387
Your future comfort is assured.

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:37.313
You don't need to know.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:41.644
Why argue about decisions you're not
powerful enough to make for yourself?

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.202
Energy will treat you well.
You know that.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:03.665
If the rule changes stay
the same, Mr. Bartholomew,

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.842
I'm playing with my team.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:10.262
Too late. The rule change is
scheduled and announced.

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:12.723
There's no going back.
You've seen to that.

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.221
Then I'll see you in Tokyo.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.437
You can be made to quit.
You can be forced.

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:19.935
You can't make me quit.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.186
Hey, watch out!

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:24.985
Don't tell me I can't.
Don't ever say that!

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:26.445
I can!

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.444
You can be stopped!

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:32.698
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.354
Look, it's all going too fast.

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:01.647
I'm not packed yet. Can't you...

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.023
Forget it. You're not going, Daph.

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.775
Those bags are ready.
Here. Hold on.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:07.653
Take this extra hat, will you?
Sir? I've had a call.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.154
I've been asked to
go over to Energy.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:11.532
You're not going to Tokyo then?
What do you mean I'm not going?

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:14.053
I suppose I will later. I hope
this isn't an inconvenience.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.530
No. No. It's... No problem.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.209
I'm supposed to go with you.

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:23.999
Well, what's that mean?

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:29.758
Who... Who told you you're
supposed to go with me? Hmm?

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.506
Nobody told me.

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:35.973
Listen, Jonathan, I really
want to go with you.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.551
I do, really.

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:39.806
You'll need me.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:43.311
Just get yourself another
assignment, will you, Daph?

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:46.024
Everybody is an assignment.
Life's an assignment.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.602
Here you go.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:54.738
You'd better do as you're told,
Jonathan. That's all I have to say.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.953
You threatening me?

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.040
Don't be here when I come back.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.913
You won't be back, Johnny boy...

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.379
Don't try to frighten me,
Daphne. You don't know how.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.214
Look...

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:13.545
You go tell them people that I'm
going to Tokyo and you're not, huh?

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.680
- You tell 'em.
- No!

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.514
Ciao.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.116
Teller.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:45.377
Make sure my gear gets
to the track in Tokyo.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:50.248
I'm gonna travel with the team this trip.
You call transportation and tell them.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:51.962
Yes, sir.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:12.737
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:23.664
What chance does Houston have
of defeating Tokyo tonight?

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:28.627
Well, both teams have fine
players and different styles.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:29.795
What do you say, Moonpie?

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:30.921
Well, yeah, yeah, but...

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:32.464
But it's not an even match, see.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.800
'Cause the Tokyo team has all
these little short guys.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:40.264
Tokyo! Tokyo!

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.009
Tokyo! Tokyo!

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.478
What about the rule changes?

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:47.851
Well...

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:50.732
At Houston, we kind of
play a wide-open system.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:53.151
Will you comment, though,
about playing in a game

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:56.530
where the rules are always changing?
Game's always had rule changes.

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.991
They don't affect the good teams.
You're a great new player.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:01.159
What's the secret of your
success on the track?

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.328
Oh, it's no secret.
I just imitate him.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.455
And plastic surgery
keeps me beautiful.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.334
There are rumors that the
last game of the season

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.628
will be played without time limit.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.297
Any comments?

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:16.425
Well, I don't think it'll come
to that. It's still a game.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:19.254
There also are rumors, some say
you're retiring from the game.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:20.804
Here I am.

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:23.223
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:27.349
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:31.148
Corporate society was
an inevitable destiny.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.734
A material dream world.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:37.234
Everything man touched
became attainable.

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:40.573
Yeah. I've been
touched all my life.

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:42.573
One way or the other.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:46.156
Either caressed or hit.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.331
It don't like seem to
matter which anymore.

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.754
I guess that's why I
wanna see Ella again.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.469
See if I still feel things now.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.093
You know what I mean?

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.142
Yeah...

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:33.540
Here are some other things, too.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:39.250
I mean, they took
Ella away from me.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:45.051
Now, they're trying to push me out.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.724
And I'd sure like to find out why.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:10:00.363
I think I'll go to one of
them computer centers.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:03.115
See what I can find out.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.034
Yeah.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.157
Finding out things, it's...

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:13.826
That's the thing, Moonpie.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:22.676
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:25.637
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:28.887
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:41.653
Hello, everyone, and
welcome to Tokyo.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.780
And tonight's dramatic
semifinal match

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:47.117
for the World's Rollerball
Championship between host Tokyo

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:50.036
and the high-flying defending
champions from Houston.

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:53.165
Late rule changes tonight
will be no penalties called,

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.789
and there is limited substitution.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:58.295
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:02.751
will you stand, please, for the
playing of our corporate hymn.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:42.350
Tokyo! Tokyo!

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:52.159
Game controller for tonight's
game, C. C. Nakamura.

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:53.577
You all right?

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:55.620
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:58.290
Just wanna get out there and
hit them little fellas.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:02.252
Listen, stay close now, all right?

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.461
Yeah.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:05.714
Okay, Johnny, let's go! Let's go!

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:08.466
Attention. Your attention, please.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.011
Rule changes for tonight's game.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:15.008
Limited substitution
and no penalties.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:20.187
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.398
Tokyo! Victory!

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:27.569
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:31.650
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.763
The controller checks the computer.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:58.683
Ready to fire the first ball, and the first
ball is fired. The game is underway!

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:02.896
Remember again, there'll be no penalties
called tonight and limited substitutions.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:06.977
This promises to be a punishing
game for both teams tonight.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.569
- Here they come!
- Let's wrap around.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.374
Spread! Spread around!

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.952
All right, boys. Go ahead.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.130
Watch out!

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.094
Stick him! Stick him!

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:37.389
Tokyo! Victory!

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.183
Stay close, now, stay close.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.934
Stick with him!

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.571
Take it! Take it in!

01:14:58.411 --> 01:14:59.954
Go! Go! Go!

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.207
It's a scramble in
front of the goal.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.751
They all go down. Kogo
won it, and he scores!

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:12.007
Kogo scores, shooting from his kneeling
position in front of the goal.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:15.462
And Tokyo takes a one-to-nothing
lead over Houston.

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:19.473
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:22.058
With Tokyo leading one to nothing.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:24.894
Houston being pressured by
the fastest opening game.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:27.097
The second ball is fired.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.699
Spread.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.901
Look out!

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:42.572
Spread out!

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.122
Tight defense!

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:45.950
Move ahead, Pete!

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.709
Move it.

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:51.129
No doubt the faster tactics
of the Tokyo team.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:55.008
And now, Houston, their bikers
and skaters form a wall.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:57.462
Tokyo! Victory!

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.600
- Hold 'em. Fast now.
- Pull out their hair.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.852
Move it!

01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:06.936
Watch the ball!

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.021
Jam them out of there!

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:09.519
Hold 'em!

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:15.480
Get 'em!

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:17.856
Watch him!

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.825
Bike him! Bike him!

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.534
Bike him! Bike him!

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:32.504
You got it, baby! You got it!

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.685
The ball is fired, and the
second period is underway,

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:49.020
with Tokyo leading one-to-nothing.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:52.065
Houston forced to come
from behind tonight.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:58.527
Are you all set up?

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:01.488
Watch the men behind me.
Watch the men behind me.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.923
The ball is in play.

01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:19.259
And it's grabbed by
Carter for Houston.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.758
Houston on the offensive attack.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.097
Whoo!

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.193
Whoo!

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.698
What more have you got? Come on!

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:49.497
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.208
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:55.128
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:58.215
Go! Let's go!

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:03.171
Right at the slot. Free
man, and he scores!

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:09.469
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:13.104
The time, 12:05, second period.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:14.772
I love this game!

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:16.191
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:18.918
Grab on there! Grab on there! Yeah!

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:23.653
Some injuries here as three
players are helped off the track.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.748
Spread!

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:33.493
Yeah! Right!

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:39.631
Come on, Moonpie! Moonpie!

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:42.130
Over here! Over here!

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:47.507
What the hell are those guys doing?
I don't know. Come on. Stay close.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:59.359
I told you stay close.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:03.696
All right. Turn 'em loose
next time around, all right?

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:04.822
- All right. Go on.
- Yeah.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.491
Go on. Go on. Go on! Come on!

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:09.487
Moonpie!

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:14.624
I got him. I got him.
Let me have him.

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:42.771
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:11.639
Medic.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.057
Everything'll be all right.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.184
Come on. Just sit down over here.

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:16.352
Sit right here.

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:18.313
Everything'll be all right.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:19.897
Medic! Hey, medic! Come over here!

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:21.315
Come on.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.259
Moonpie!

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:08.780
Come on, Moonpie.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:10.656
Come on, get some help!

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:12.905
Set him down. Set him down.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.616
Where's oxygen?

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:52.025
Come on, Tokyo! Go and get them!

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:54.034
Go! Go! Go, Tokyo!

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:56.449
Okay, now come on, now!

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.913
Jonathan, watch yourself out there.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:02.542
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:06.337
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:08.256
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.714
Take me high, Blue.

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:34.900
Tokyo! Victory!

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.461
Look out!

01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:34.675
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:41.807
Jonathan E.

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:45.683
Time in the third period...

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:17.215
Spread! Spread! Go kill 'em!

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:27.146
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:36.029
Fall out! Fall out!

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:39.983
Blue.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.601
This way, please.

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:30.416
May I say first, please, that you
played a superb game in our city.

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:31.952
Thank you.

01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:42.922
A simple problem, yet I know
it is difficult for you.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:47.808
Your teammate has no family we can
contact, and permission is required now

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:50.103
before consummating matters.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.068
So he's technically dead?

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.021
Yes, unfortunately.

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:02.942
His heart and lungs will
function, but his brain is...

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:05.030
It has expired.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.996
From the first minutes we
had him, it was hopeless.

01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:11.075
I believe this was
explained to you.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.367
He's warm.

01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:14.210
Yes.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:17.836
But if you will, please. You must
sign a release form. It is required.

01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:21.668
Does he...

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:28.133
Does he dream?

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.685
No. There is no brain wave at all.

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.896
No sort of consciousness.
Just a deep coma.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.272
A vegetable.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:37.225
No dreams. Nothing.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.187
Well, even...

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:44.900
A plant feels something.

01:26:45.075 --> 01:26:46.948
Who can say? Please.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:48.988
It...

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.367
Senses life. I mean,

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:56.870
it turns towards the sun.

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:00.290
It's alive, isn't it?

01:27:00.507 --> 01:27:01.708
You must sign.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:05.011
You...

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:08.010
You just leave him the way he is.

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:11.726
Just leave him as he is.

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:14.145
Someone will have to sign.
There's no other way.

01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:15.855
Arrangements will be made.

01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:18.023
Please. There are hospital
rules that have to be...

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.851
No, there aren't.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:22.987
There aren't any rules at all.

01:28:08.992 --> 01:28:11.741
Let me know if you
have any problems.

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:14.953
You won't find any
answers in Geneva.

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:19.085
Take care of your arm.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:59.501
In my opinion, we are confronted
here with something of a situation.

01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:03.956
Otherwise, I would not have
presumed to take up your time.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:08.677
Once again, it concerns
the case of Jonathan E.

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:14.349
We know we don't want anything
extraordinary to happen to Jonathan.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:16.639
We already agreed on that.

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.808
No accidents, nothing unnatural.

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:25.648
The game was created to demonstrate
the futility of individual effort.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.856
Let the game do its work.

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:32.822
If the Energy Corporation
has done all it can

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:37.830
and if a champion defeats the meaning
for which the game was designed,

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:40.705
then he must lose.

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:44.671
I hope you agree with my reasoning.

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:08.023
Thank you, all.

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:06.790
Will you follow me, please?

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.250
Hello, hello!

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:47.953
Yes, it is

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:50.004
the famous Jonathan E.

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.878
Oh, hard to believe.

01:31:51.881 --> 01:31:53.257
Sorry we've never met.

01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:55.467
The Rollerball Champion.

01:31:55.468 --> 01:31:57.177
Wonderful.

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:59.513
Not many people come
to see us, you know.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:02.308
We're not easy to
talk to, Zero and I.

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:06.013
We're a little confused
again in here today.

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:08.769
This is embarrassing.

01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:12.815
It's embarrassing
to misplace things.

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:14.653
Misplacing data?

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.482
Mmm. The whole of the 13th century.

01:32:20.452 --> 01:32:24.455
Misplaced the computers, several
conventional computers.

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:26.454
We can't find them.

01:32:27.584 --> 01:32:31.163
We're always moving things
around, getting organized.

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:35.838
My assistants and I.
But this, this is Zero's fault.

01:32:35.967 --> 01:32:39.171
Zero. He's the world's
file cabinet.

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:43.808
Eh, pity. Poor old 13th century.

01:32:47.312 --> 01:32:49.310
Well, come along now.

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:50.856
You want to get started, don't you?

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:52.354
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:55.270
- Oh.
- Hmm?

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:01.822
This way.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.615
Now...

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:09.458
But we've lost those computers with
all of the 13th century in them.

01:33:09.459 --> 01:33:12.082
Not much in the century, just Dante

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:17.543
and a few corrupt Popes, but it's
so distracting and annoying.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:22.048
You've unlimited restrictions
here, of course.

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:24.890
You have to come so, so many times.

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:28.435
It all takes such... Such effort.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.854
Do the executives still come here?

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.981
Oh, they used to, some of them.

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:34.191
What about the books?

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:36.193
Books? Books? Oh, no,
they're all changed,

01:33:36.194 --> 01:33:39.318
all transcribed, all
information's here.

01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:44.661
I mean, Zero, of course. He's the
central brain, the world's brain.

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:47.238
Fluid mechanics, fluidics.

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:52.119
He's liquid, you see.
He's water to touch.

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:55.038
All knowledge.

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:02.762
Everything we ask has become
so, ah, so complicated now.

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:04.471
Each thing we ask...

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:07.474
This morning, we wanted to know
something about the 13th century.

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:10.811
He flows out into all
our storage systems.

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:12.563
He considers everything.

01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:14.437
He's become so

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.560
ambiguous now.

01:34:16.693 --> 01:34:19.772
As if he knows nothing at all.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.739
Could you tell me something
about the corporate wars?

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.616
Wars? Wars?

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:26.952
Oh, yes, of course, we
have them all here.

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:29.705
Punic War, Prussian
War, Peloponnesian War.

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:31.290
Crimean War, Wars of the Roses.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:36.042
One doesn't perhaps recall them
in sequence, but corporate wars.

01:34:36.796 --> 01:34:41.172
Well, Zero will or can, I'm
sure, tell you anything.

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:53.559
A memory pool, you see.

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:57.441
He's supposed to tell
us where things are

01:34:57.442 --> 01:35:00.065
and what they might possibly mean.

01:35:02.238 --> 01:35:04.361
Look, Zero, a visitor.

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:08.782
Jonathan E.,
the Rollerball Champion.

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:12.699
You've filed away a
lot of data on him.

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:15.459
Do you remember?

01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:18.045
Does it answer you?

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.919
Oh, yes. He speaks.

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.254
He finds things.

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.377
And loses them,

01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:27.680
and confuses itself.

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:32.309
Ask anything.
He'll find it for you.

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:34.353
A section on Bach...

01:35:34.354 --> 01:35:36.181
Won't you, Zero?

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:39.442
All right. I'd like...

01:35:41.319 --> 01:35:45.740
I'd like some information
about corporate decisions.

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:47.797
How they're made and
who makes them.

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:54.616
Zero...

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:57.122
You heard the question.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.627
Answer him.

01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:01.505
Negative.

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:05.427
You don't have to give him
a full political briefing.

01:36:06.386 --> 01:36:07.511
Answer.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:08.887
Negative.

01:36:08.888 --> 01:36:11.216
This is Jonathan E.

01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:13.138
He has to know.

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:16.099
Make it simple.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:18.438
Answer.

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:22.018
Corporate decisions are made
by corporate executives.

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:23.735
Corporate executives make...

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:27.656
I know we have the answers.
We do have. They're the waters of history.

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:29.734
Energy equals genius...

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:33.036
I don't want to bully you.

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:34.955
Genius is energy.

01:36:34.956 --> 01:36:37.749
Corporate entities control...

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:39.751
I shall have to answer!

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:42.546
Of economic life, technology,

01:36:42.547 --> 01:36:45.590
capital, labor, and markets.

01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:47.134
Corporate decisions are made...

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:49.212
You have to, Zero.

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:54.558
Let's show him policy.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:57.352
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.

01:36:57.353 --> 01:37:00.181
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.

01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:33.298
Hello, Johnny.

01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:36.175
Morning, Ella.

01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:39.221
Nervous.

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:43.516
How are you?

01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:52.362
I'm... I'm all right, I guess.

01:37:56.954 --> 01:37:58.906
What are you doing?

01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:01.284
Looking at you.

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:04.503
Counting your scars.

01:38:05.421 --> 01:38:06.505
Yeah.

01:38:06.506 --> 01:38:08.708
Seeing how you've changed.

01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:11.214
Oh, I mean, that's...

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:12.803
That's all I've changed, huh?

01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.971
Just a little more beat up.

01:38:14.972 --> 01:38:16.344
Oh, no.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.473
You're just not...

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:23.018
Yeah, well...

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.352
Come on.

01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:42.040
You want a drink or something?

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:43.743
No, thank you.

01:38:44.502 --> 01:38:46.704
You have a lovely place.

01:38:46.796 --> 01:38:48.505
Well, thank you.

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:50.715
Well, I've seen your house.

01:38:50.716 --> 01:38:52.213
You have?

01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:56.881
Yeah. When we, uh,

01:38:58.015 --> 01:38:59.888
played in Rome,

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:02.470
I stood a block away

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:06.815
and watched your front
gate for a couple hours.

01:39:10.528 --> 01:39:13.197
I was just, uh,

01:39:15.575 --> 01:39:18.904
standing there wondering

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:22.539
what your furniture looked like.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.541
What you said to each
other in the morning.

01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:28.496
Yeah.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.754
What's he like? What's he do?

01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:35.051
Oh, he's a city engineer.

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:36.299
Ah.

01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:39.470
We have a jet copter.

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:41.638
A son.

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:44.099
Two cats, and a place in the Alps.

01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:48.566
Well, you don't really
want hear all of this.

01:39:49.692 --> 01:39:51.144
Son, huh?

01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:53.028
Yes.

01:39:57.366 --> 01:39:59.568
We have a lot of friends.

01:39:59.785 --> 01:40:01.237
And he has a lover.

01:40:01.412 --> 01:40:03.364
We have furniture a lot like yours.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:07.209
Same taste in furniture,
how about that?

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:08.832
Yes.

01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:14.508
You know, Johnny.

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:17.594
All they want is a kind
of incidental control

01:40:17.595 --> 01:40:19.797
over just a part of our lives.

01:40:20.515 --> 01:40:22.933
I mean, they have control
economically and politically,

01:40:22.934 --> 01:40:24.434
but they also provide.

01:40:24.435 --> 01:40:25.602
You know they do.

01:40:25.603 --> 01:40:27.305
Provide, huh?

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:35.278
You know, they were responsible
for taking you away.

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:37.322
And I started to hate 'em.

01:40:37.323 --> 01:40:38.991
They weren't.

01:40:40.117 --> 01:40:42.115
It was the game, Johnny.

01:40:48.626 --> 01:40:52.581
I mean, it was important to you.

01:40:57.134 --> 01:40:59.678
It was as if I wasn't even there.

01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:05.680
You played. There was nothing else.

01:41:08.688 --> 01:41:10.231
I'm sorry.

01:41:14.694 --> 01:41:16.942
You know I wanted you here.

01:41:17.613 --> 01:41:19.156
I mean...

01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:23.194
This might sound all wrong, but,

01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:27.782
I mean, I was just trying to

01:41:28.833 --> 01:41:30.831
remember myself then.

01:41:33.963 --> 01:41:35.255
Yeah.

01:41:38.134 --> 01:41:39.881
Maybe it was

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:43.973
love I wanted to try to remember.

01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:01.653
There's, uh,

01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:05.744
a lot of things I want
to talk to you about.

01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:11.408
Yeah.

01:42:16.422 --> 01:42:18.624
I've been thinking, Ella.

01:42:18.674 --> 01:42:20.626
Been thinking a lot.

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:22.803
And watching.

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:27.891
It's like people who had
a choice long time ago

01:42:27.892 --> 01:42:31.603
between having all them nice things

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:34.603
or their freedom.

01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:36.772
Of course, they, uh,

01:42:37.902 --> 01:42:39.604
chose comfort.

01:42:40.112 --> 01:42:42.235
But comfort is freedom.

01:42:42.657 --> 01:42:44.609
It always has been.

01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:49.204
The whole history of civilization is
a struggle against poverty and need.

01:42:49.205 --> 01:42:52.123
No. No, that... That's not it.

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:53.541
That's never been it.

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:55.669
I mean, them privileges
just buy us off.

01:42:59.757 --> 01:43:01.959
Look.

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:05.129
They want me to quit, Ella.

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:07.973
Then quit.

01:43:09.642 --> 01:43:11.640
Just like that, huh?

01:43:11.644 --> 01:43:13.972
But you've got to do it now.

01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:16.231
You've got to before it's too late.

01:43:16.232 --> 01:43:18.480
Whether you want to or not.

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:22.942
Look, Johnny,

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:27.242
the next game there won't be
any substitutions allowed.

01:43:27.243 --> 01:43:28.740
And no time limit.

01:43:29.787 --> 01:43:32.455
You'll die, Johnny.
Everybody will die.

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:35.079
No time limit. They tell you that?

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:36.459
Yes.

01:43:36.502 --> 01:43:38.702
They tell you to come here
and convince me to quit?

01:43:38.713 --> 01:43:41.416
Yes, but that isn't
why I came here.

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:44.297
You have to get out
for your own sake.

01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:47.004
Oh, please, Johnny, please.

01:43:48.139 --> 01:43:51.343
They tell you to
stay if I did quit?

01:43:54.353 --> 01:43:56.226
You my big reward?

01:44:35.811 --> 01:44:38.855
You still don't understand
why I came here.

01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:45.359
You're the only
person I ever wanted.

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:49.570
I wanted you on my
side, that's all.

01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:43.458
It's like you're a God now.

01:45:46.298 --> 01:45:48.626
Maybe you know what I don't.

01:45:52.638 --> 01:45:53.964
I...

01:45:55.391 --> 01:45:57.889
I've been so stupid for so long.

01:46:08.404 --> 01:46:10.481
I've been so stubborn.

01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:13.199
I don't even know why.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.868
It scares me.

01:46:20.833 --> 01:46:24.499
You know, I'm probably gonna...
Probably gonna die.

01:46:27.423 --> 01:46:31.093
And you'll be in here pumping
away long after I'm gone.

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:48.397
Hey, you...

01:46:48.986 --> 01:46:51.188
You got it made, old buddy.

01:46:52.907 --> 01:46:55.155
Bluebonnets and everything.

01:49:03.537 --> 01:49:08.166
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:49:08.167 --> 01:49:12.042
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!

01:49:17.092 --> 01:49:21.422
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:50:17.236 --> 01:50:19.859
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

01:50:40.384 --> 01:50:43.428
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

01:50:44.513 --> 01:50:48.138
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!

01:50:54.273 --> 01:50:57.233
Attention! Your attention, please.

01:50:57.234 --> 01:51:01.280
Rule changes for tonight's
World Championship game.

01:51:01.405 --> 01:51:04.950
No substitutions, no penalties,

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:08.161
and no time limit.

01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:35.355
All right, watch it now. He's got the
ball, next time around we defend.

01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:04.384
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

01:52:24.154 --> 01:52:28.075
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!

01:52:59.481 --> 01:53:02.309
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

01:54:08.842 --> 01:54:11.010
Come on! Come on, get out of there!

01:54:26.526 --> 01:54:27.773
Get him up!

01:54:43.085 --> 01:54:44.502
He did it!

01:54:52.135 --> 01:54:54.463
All right. That's right,
get him in the elevator.

01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:01.686
Get off the rail!

01:55:03.313 --> 01:55:06.983
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's
dead! Jonathan's dead!

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:11.656
- Come on!
- We gotta get him off the track.

01:55:23.125 --> 01:55:24.834
I don't want another
man on that track!

01:55:24.835 --> 01:55:26.795
Houston, what the hell
are you trying to do?

01:55:32.426 --> 01:55:33.968
Nobody's gonna win this game!

01:55:33.969 --> 01:55:36.968
Game? This wasn't
meant to be a game!

01:55:37.848 --> 01:55:39.220
Never!

01:55:47.399 --> 01:55:49.818
- Jonathan! Jonathan!
- Houston! Houston!

01:55:57.325 --> 01:56:00.574
Watch his leg. Watch
that leg. Easy, easy.

01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:05.329
Let me have him. Let me
have him! Let me have him!

01:56:19.931 --> 01:56:22.930
Move out. Move out.

02:00:59.461 --> 02:01:01.208
Jonathan.

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:03.540
Jonathan.

02:01:04.215 --> 02:01:07.919
Jonathan. Jonathan.

02:01:08.136 --> 02:01:11.715
Jonathan! Jonathan!

02:01:18.521 --> 02:01:19.973
Jonathan.

02:01:20.690 --> 02:01:22.187
