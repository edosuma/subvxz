GATES:
I'm Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

00:06.666 --> 00:09.309
Welcome to
"Finding Your Roots."

00:09.333 --> 00:12.942
In this episode, we'll
meet actors Pamela Adlon

00:12.966 --> 00:15.076
and Kathryn Hahn.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.909
Two women whose family
trees have been obscured

00:17.933 --> 00:19.533
by family secrets.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.609
HAHN: They went to
a new world and

00:22.633 --> 00:25.166
they shut a door completely.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.166
ADLON: What?!?
How do you know that?

00:28.866 --> 00:32.766
GATES: To uncover their roots,
we've used every tool available.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.876
Genealogists combed through
paper trails stretching back

00:35.900 --> 00:40.009
hundreds of years, while DNA
experts utilized the latest

00:40.033 --> 00:43.542
advances in genetic analysis
to reveal secrets that have

00:43.566 --> 00:46.133
lain hidden for generations.

00:46.366 --> 00:48.076
ADLON: Plot twist!

00:48.100 --> 00:50.809
GATES: And we've compiled
it all into a book of life.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.842
HAHN: Oh wow!

00:51.866 --> 00:53.076
(gasps)

00:53.100 --> 00:54.642
GATES: A record of all
of our discoveries.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.342
You are the
product of this scandal.

00:56.366 --> 00:57.210
HAHN: I know.

00:57.234 --> 00:58.309
GATES: You are the end result.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.676
HAHN: Isn't that nuts?

00:59.700 --> 01:01.609
ADLON: It's the most
exciting thing in the world.

01:01.633 --> 01:03.476
This is an amazing gift.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.309
HAHN: What a freaking story!

01:06.333 --> 01:09.542
GATES: My two guests are tied
together by a common thread:

01:09.566 --> 01:12.742
both descend from people
who concealed the most basic

01:12.766 --> 01:16.309
details about themselves,
leaving their descendants to

01:16.333 --> 01:19.433
wonder who they really are.

01:19.633 --> 01:23.109
In this episode, we'll
separate fact from fiction,

01:23.133 --> 01:26.909
introducing Kathryn and Pamela
to ancestors whose names and

01:26.933 --> 01:30.742
stories had been
hidden for generations,

01:30.766 --> 01:33.666
forever altering how
they see themselves.

01:44.600 --> 01:51.533
(theme music plays)

02:02.766 --> 02:08.900
♪ ♪

02:14.633 --> 02:18.333
GATES: Pamela Adlon is
at the top of her game.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.776
After years in the
show business wilderness,

02:20.800 --> 02:25.142
she's the writer, director and
star of one of television's

02:25.166 --> 02:27.000
most celebrated shows:

02:28.166 --> 02:31.066
the Peabody-award-winning
"Better Things".

02:31.900 --> 02:35.076
But to appreciate just
how far Pamela's come,

02:35.100 --> 02:37.933
you need to go back
to where she started.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.276
Pamela was born
in New York City,

02:41.300 --> 02:44.309
where her mother, an
English expatriate,

02:44.333 --> 02:47.209
struggled to fit in
and where her father,

02:47.233 --> 02:50.609
a Bostonian,
struggled to make a living,

02:50.633 --> 02:52.276
bouncing from job to job

02:52.300 --> 02:55.100
as a writer and
television producer.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.466
Watching her dad work, Pamela
picked up a taste for acting,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.400
and found an agent when
she was just 11 years old,

03:03.766 --> 03:06.233
in a story that sounds
straight out of Hollywood.

03:07.933 --> 03:12.776
ADLON: I met a girl, and she
was saying I have an agent,

03:12.800 --> 03:14.842
and I was like what's that?

03:14.866 --> 03:18.309
And she showed me her
composite picture with like,

03:18.333 --> 03:22.476
her like you know, eating an
apple and throwing a baseball

03:22.500 --> 03:25.842
and it said
Beverly Hecht Agency on it.

03:25.866 --> 03:27.176
GATES: Huh.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.276
ADLON: And so then I went home
and I looked in the phonebook

03:29.300 --> 03:32.376
and I called her and I
made an appointment.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.309
And I sat my parents
down and I was like,

03:34.333 --> 03:37.142
yo, I want to get an
agent and whatever.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.942
And they didn't fight me.

03:39.966 --> 03:41.509
So, we went in to meet her.

03:41.533 --> 03:45.242
She had me read copy
of a tide commercial,

03:45.266 --> 03:48.076
and it was, like, totally
like one of those old movies.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.142
She brings my mother in.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.442
It's like she's got a cigarette.

03:51.466 --> 03:55.600
The kid's terrific.
She's a natural.

03:56.566 --> 03:58.776
GATES: Pamela was,
indeed, a natural.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.509
By the time she was 20,

04:01.533 --> 04:04.176
she'd appeared in a
series of hit sitcoms,

04:04.200 --> 04:05.642
JO: Oh, well look who's here.

04:05.666 --> 04:07.109
GATES: And was
essentially supporting

04:07.133 --> 04:08.542
her parents financially.

04:08.566 --> 04:09.966
ADLON: Not bad, huh?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.809
GATES: Then the
roles stopped coming,

04:12.833 --> 04:15.476
and Pamela went
through a long dry period,

04:15.500 --> 04:17.576
earning money as a voice actor,

04:17.600 --> 04:21.042
and wrestling with a host of
personal challenges:

04:21.066 --> 04:25.009
from the death of her father
to a divorce which left her

04:25.033 --> 04:28.233
the single mother of
three young girls.

04:28.966 --> 04:32.509
Miraculously, she not
only managed to recover,

04:32.533 --> 04:36.233
she turned her ordeal into art.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.876
"Better Things", is a
brilliantly stylized riff on

04:39.900 --> 04:44.076
her own experiences, a fact
that makes Pamela all the more

04:44.100 --> 04:46.866
grateful for its success.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.109
ADLON: I finally took
the bones of my life.

04:52.133 --> 04:55.809
My show is about single
mom, three daughters,

04:55.833 --> 04:57.976
English mother lives next door.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.242
GATES: Mmm-hmm..

04:59.266 --> 05:03.009
ADLON: And what people have
responded to is that they're

05:03.033 --> 05:07.309
passionate about the show and
the content but it's the story

05:07.333 --> 05:12.176
of this lady who made it at 50.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.500
How crazy is that?

05:14.766 --> 05:16.009
GATES: How crazy is that.

05:16.033 --> 05:18.942
ADLON: I should be in the
dust bin at the Jewish Council

05:18.966 --> 05:21.276
Thrift Store in
Sherman Oaks, California.

05:21.300 --> 05:27.566
Like, that all of a
sudden at 50 I become a boss,

05:27.933 --> 05:30.909
a director,
producer, show-runner,

05:30.933 --> 05:33.642
star of my own show.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.633
It's absolutely incredible.

05:37.966 --> 05:40.676
GATES: Ironically, while
"Better Things" explores some

05:40.700 --> 05:45.076
dark territory, particularly
between Pamela's character and

05:45.100 --> 05:46.309
her mother's...

05:46.333 --> 05:48.309
ADLON: Get out.
MOTHER: Don't be ridiculous.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.533
GIRLS: Mom!

05:50.733 --> 05:52.976
ADLON: Get out!

05:53.000 --> 05:55.476
GATES: Making the show
has actually brought the two

05:55.500 --> 05:58.533
closer together in real life.

05:59.566 --> 06:02.942
ADLON: My mother used to drive
me crazy and she would tell me

06:02.966 --> 06:06.733
these stories and I would
be like oh, god, really.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.342
Do I need to hear
about Verizon or like

06:10.366 --> 06:12.876
going to the store?

06:12.900 --> 06:18.700
So one day, I stopped being
driven crazy by my mom and

06:19.000 --> 06:22.209
I just looked at her
and I went, oh, she's funny.

06:22.233 --> 06:25.542
This is funny.
Let me embrace this.

06:25.566 --> 06:28.609
And now my mom is
like my biggest muse.

06:28.633 --> 06:33.809
And she got really extra sassy
with me in the past few years

06:33.833 --> 06:36.376
and her answer is, oh,
you love it because it's

06:36.400 --> 06:39.266
material for your show.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.242
GATES: Much like Pamela,
my second guest,

06:43.266 --> 06:47.276
Kathryn Hahn, has spent
almost her entire life

06:47.300 --> 06:48.666
in show business.

06:49.333 --> 06:52.542
But the beloved actor, who
became a breakout star by

06:52.566 --> 06:55.700
stealing scene after
scene in "Wanda Vision",

06:56.733 --> 06:59.600
didn't start off big, marching
into an agent's office.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.642
Quite the contrary.

07:02.666 --> 07:05.142
Growing up in a
suburb of Cleveland,

07:05.166 --> 07:08.933
Kathryn got her first acting job
when she was in fourth grade,

07:09.200 --> 07:10.776
on "Hickory Hideout,"

07:10.800 --> 07:14.400
a children's program produced
by a local news station.

07:14.866 --> 07:17.700
It wasn't exactly a plumb role,

07:17.933 --> 07:19.909
but Kathryn was hooked.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.900
HAHN: Wow, to be a movie star.

07:23.133 --> 07:26.942
It involved a tree house
and two squirrel puppets,

07:26.966 --> 07:30.976
Nutso and Shirley Squirrely,
and, uh, an owl puppet

07:31.000 --> 07:32.342
called know-it-owl.

07:32.366 --> 07:33.376
GATES: Mm-hmm.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.476
HAHN: And I played a
character named Jenny,

07:35.500 --> 07:38.209
and it would involve
me asking know-it-Owl,

07:38.233 --> 07:40.509
uh, various questions
about getting braces,

07:40.533 --> 07:43.242
or, you know, my
parents got a divorce,

07:43.266 --> 07:46.276
in the show, and I would ask
the owl for advice about

07:46.300 --> 07:47.676
how to deal with it.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.009
It was local
television, you know?

07:49.033 --> 07:50.309
12 people saw it.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.676
It was on at like 6:00, 6:30
in the morning on Saturdays in

07:52.700 --> 07:54.042
Cleveland and Pittsburgh.

07:54.066 --> 07:55.800
GATES: Right.

07:56.333 --> 07:59.009
HAHN: But to me,
I was very excited.

07:59.033 --> 08:01.709
I took it as seriously
as if I, as if,

08:01.733 --> 08:04.842
that I, you know, I was
in "The Deer Hunter".

08:04.866 --> 08:07.266
Like I was so serious about it.

08:08.433 --> 08:11.842
GATES: Perhaps unsurprisingly,
"Hickory Hideout" didn't lead

08:11.866 --> 08:13.842
to bigger roles.

08:13.866 --> 08:17.609
Nevertheless, Kathryn
was determined to act,

08:17.633 --> 08:20.809
and her parents
supported her ambitions.

08:20.833 --> 08:24.100
For years, that seemed
like a foolish choice.

08:26.066 --> 08:29.509
After college, Kathryn
moved to New York City and

08:29.533 --> 08:32.533
was forced to confront the
reality of her profession,

08:33.300 --> 08:36.076
working in
restaurants and hair salons,

08:36.100 --> 08:38.900
as she chased jobs
that never came.

08:39.333 --> 08:42.209
HAHN: Those 20s were
a bl, a mad blur of

08:42.233 --> 08:44.509
racing towards auditions
and not getting them

08:44.533 --> 08:46.342
and handing out head shots.

08:46.366 --> 08:47.776
GATES: Yeah.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.242
HAHN: Trying to get an agent.

08:49.266 --> 08:50.609
I mean, I would
write on my head shot,

08:50.633 --> 08:54.409
"You've got to see this girl!"
and I'm like, "Just fake it!"

08:54.433 --> 08:56.409
And, like, not
getting any calls.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.410
It was awful.

08:57.434 --> 08:59.776
GATES: So what,
what kept you going?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.309
HAHN: There was no choice.
I had no choice.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.709
There was no other option.

09:03.733 --> 09:05.009
GATES: Right. None.

09:05.033 --> 09:06.276
HAHN: None.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.642
GATES: But did deep down you
think I'm going to make it?

09:07.666 --> 09:08.676
HAHN: Yes!

09:08.700 --> 09:10.009
I didn't think I was
going to, didn't know.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.942
Again, I didn't know if
I was ever going to land

09:11.966 --> 09:13.942
somewhere successfully.

09:13.966 --> 09:15.842
I didn't know how it
was going to look,

09:15.866 --> 09:17.933
but I had no option.

09:19.166 --> 09:22.066
GATES: Kathryn's "options"
would take time to appear,

09:22.733 --> 09:25.533
but once they did,
they came in bunches.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.742
Starting out with small
parts in big budget comedies,

09:29.766 --> 09:32.466
she slowly moved into
prestige television,

09:32.766 --> 09:34.276
and became a star.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.800
Creating a string of
indelible characters.

09:37.033 --> 09:39.209
HAHN: The name's
Agatha Harkness.

09:39.233 --> 09:41.966
Lovely to
finally meet you, dear.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.742
GATES: And now, at an age
when Hollywood historically

09:44.766 --> 09:47.509
provides fewer
starring roles for women,

09:47.533 --> 09:49.333
Kathryn is a phenomenon.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.766
It's been an incredible journey.

09:53.433 --> 09:56.342
But when she looks back for
the source of her success,

09:56.366 --> 10:00.009
Kathryn returns to the people
who were there all along:

10:00.033 --> 10:01.933
her parents.

10:03.133 --> 10:07.609
HAHN: Both of them
believed in me and my,

10:07.633 --> 10:11.876
this bananas dream to be an
actor without a question from

10:11.900 --> 10:13.109
the beginning.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.309
GATES: Wow.

10:14.333 --> 10:18.809
HAHN: And that support I think
was clearly imperative

10:18.833 --> 10:21.109
to where I am.

10:21.133 --> 10:22.209
GATES: Crucial.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.376
HAHN: Crucial.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.809
GATES: Crucial, but what's
wrong with your parents?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.742
Normal parents would say,
"Are you crazy?"

10:26.766 --> 10:27.543
You know like...

10:27.567 --> 10:28.642
HAHN: Yeah, they just didn't.

10:28.666 --> 10:30.109
I mean, I was just all
of a sudden in a U-Haul

10:30.133 --> 10:31.010
going to New York.

10:31.034 --> 10:32.042
GATES: Yeah.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.209
HAHN: And they
were like, "okay."

10:33.233 --> 10:34.276
GATES: That's amazing.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.509
HAHN: They just
didn't have any...

10:35.533 --> 10:37.176
There was no question that
it was just going to happen.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.276
GATES: And never once from
the time you were a little kid

10:39.300 --> 10:41.342
when you first
voiced this fantasy,

10:41.366 --> 10:43.776
never once did they say,
"Baby, it's a hard way..."

10:43.800 --> 10:44.777
HAHN: Never.

10:44.801 --> 10:46.509
GATES: Or, "You got to eat,"
or you know?

10:46.533 --> 10:47.776
"You'd make a lot
more money as a lawyer?"

10:47.800 --> 10:48.909
HAHN: Never.
GATES: Never.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.942
HAHN: I mean, it was
just an unquestioned thing.

10:50.966 --> 10:51.976
GATES: You were lucky.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.242
HAHN: I was so lucky.

10:53.266 --> 10:54.576
GATES: Yeah.
No, you were.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.433
HAHN: I agree with you.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.042
GATES: My guests both come
from tight-knit families that

10:59.066 --> 11:01.276
nurtured their dreams.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.509
Those same families
also harbored secrets that

11:04.533 --> 11:07.433
shrouded their roots in mystery.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.000
It was time to bring
these secrets to light.

11:11.633 --> 11:14.409
I started with Pamela, who
came to me with a very

11:14.433 --> 11:17.842
basic question: she wanted
to know the identity of

11:17.866 --> 11:19.933
her mother's father.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.942
She'd heard rumors that the
man whom she believed to be

11:22.966 --> 11:27.233
her grandfather wasn't in
fact related to her at all,

11:28.600 --> 11:32.166
and that her mother was
the product of an affair.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.876
But Pamela didn't know if
these rumors were true.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.309
And her mother's family,

11:37.333 --> 11:39.876
with its very English
sense of propriety,

11:39.900 --> 11:42.566
wasn't about
to help her find out.

11:43.333 --> 11:47.142
ADLON: It's it's very hard,
the English side,

11:47.166 --> 11:50.776
because there are
things you don't do.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.176
And so, um, when one generation

11:54.200 --> 11:57.400
does not reveal

11:57.700 --> 12:01.909
certain things then the next
generation feels that they're

12:01.933 --> 12:03.242
not to be revealed.

12:03.266 --> 12:04.509
GATES: Yes.

12:04.533 --> 12:07.176
ADLON: If they have gone to
their graves without talking

12:07.200 --> 12:09.076
about it, it's not
anybody's business...

12:09.100 --> 12:10.276
GATES: Right.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.076
ADLON: And that's
frustrating for me.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.876
GATES: It's the
generational cone of silence.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.142
ADLON: Yeah, man.

12:15.166 --> 12:21.076
I want to know and I don't
want to disrespect my lineage,

12:21.100 --> 12:25.666
but I really, I'm so curious.

12:27.233 --> 12:30.076
GATES: Pamela's
curiosity was palpable,

12:30.100 --> 12:33.766
but satisfying it would
test our team to the limit.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.876
Her mother, Marina Lucy Leece,

12:37.900 --> 12:41.566
was born in
Birkenhead, England in 1935.

12:42.266 --> 12:44.076
According to her
birth certificate,

12:44.100 --> 12:47.433
her parents were
Leonard and Phyllis Leece.

12:47.633 --> 12:51.409
And there were no documents to
suggest that Leonard was not

12:51.433 --> 12:55.333
Marina's father, but that's
exactly what Marina believed.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.433
This left us with
only one option: DNA.

13:02.700 --> 13:06.442
We compared Marina's DNA to
that of millions of others in

13:06.466 --> 13:10.476
publicly-available databases,
and we found that she has

13:10.500 --> 13:15.633
roughly 250 matches within
the last five generations.

13:16.266 --> 13:18.842
But when we started looking
among them for matches that

13:18.866 --> 13:21.242
connect her to Leonard Leece,

13:21.266 --> 13:23.166
we got a very a
different number.

13:24.433 --> 13:26.809
ADLON: I see the word zero.

13:26.833 --> 13:27.743
Zero!

13:27.767 --> 13:29.842
GATES: So, you
know what that means?

13:29.866 --> 13:32.342
It means that your
mother was absolutely right.

13:32.366 --> 13:37.076
She has absolutely no genetic
relationship to Leonard Leece.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.642
She is not his
biological daughter.

13:40.666 --> 13:42.209
ADLON: Damn.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.142
GATES: So, that's the first
thing we had to establish.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.276
ADLON: Copy.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.609
GATES: Was this story true?

13:47.633 --> 13:48.642
ADLON: Wow.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.409
GATES: And it's true.

13:50.433 --> 13:53.542
So, this is where
things get a little tricky.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.933
ADLON: Who is this interloper?

13:56.600 --> 14:00.309
GATES: DNA was clearly telling
us that Leonard was not your

14:00.333 --> 14:03.509
biological grandfather but it
wasn't telling us who was your

14:03.533 --> 14:04.709
biological grandfather.

14:04.733 --> 14:06.142
ADLON: Mm-hum.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.342
GATES: Part of the problem
is that DNA testing just

14:08.366 --> 14:11.009
isn't as popular, and this
will not shock you,

14:11.033 --> 14:14.176
or as mainstream in the
united kingdom as it is

14:14.200 --> 14:17.433
here in the United States.

14:17.866 --> 14:19.542
For reasons that we
have discussed already.

14:19.566 --> 14:20.842
ADLON: Oh my god.

14:20.866 --> 14:22.542
GATES: That is a secret that
we are not going to discuss...

14:22.566 --> 14:23.576
ADLON: Yes.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.609
GATES: And it will be
taken to the grave.

14:24.633 --> 14:27.200
ADLON: Totally.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.842
GATES: Lacking
enough DNA samples,

14:29.866 --> 14:31.942
the next phase of our
research would consume

14:31.966 --> 14:34.276
almost five years,

14:34.300 --> 14:37.733
more time than we've ever
spent on a guest before.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.076
But it was worth it.

14:40.100 --> 14:43.809
Eventually, we were able
to tie Pamela's mother Marina

14:43.833 --> 14:47.933
to a married couple named
Benjamin and Rose Walthew.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.409
Benjamin and Rose lived
in Birkenhead in the

14:50.433 --> 14:53.142
early 20th century.

14:53.166 --> 14:56.476
Based on the genetic profiles
of their descendants,

14:56.500 --> 15:00.533
we knew that they were Marina's
biological grandparents,

15:01.500 --> 15:05.300
and that one of their
sons was Marina's father.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.576
The only problem?

15:07.600 --> 15:10.200
Benjamin and Rose had five sons!

15:11.200 --> 15:13.742
And we didn't have enough
DNA evidence to tell us

15:13.766 --> 15:15.533
which was our man.

15:15.866 --> 15:18.376
But then our
researchers noticed something.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.476
One of the five sons,
Joseph Walthew,

15:21.500 --> 15:24.976
had fathered a daughter in
Birkenhead two years after

15:25.000 --> 15:26.866
Marina was born.

15:27.366 --> 15:29.342
Her name was Gloria.

15:29.366 --> 15:33.176
If Gloria were still alive,
she could help us.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.166
But that raised yet
one more problem.

15:36.866 --> 15:39.342
Unfortunately, we
couldn't find Gloria

15:39.366 --> 15:43.042
anywhere in England.

15:43.066 --> 15:46.366
ADLON: You found her in?

15:46.866 --> 15:48.576
GATES: Upstate New York.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.333
ADLON: Stop it. Stop it.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.309
GATES: Gloria is alive and
in great health and living in

15:54.333 --> 15:56.509
Upstate New York,
and we found her.

15:56.533 --> 15:59.242
ADLON: Oh, my god.

15:59.266 --> 16:02.809
Can we stop right now
so I can go call Gloria?

16:02.833 --> 16:03.677
GATES: No.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.242
ADLON: Okay.

16:05.266 --> 16:10.000
GATES: She's a widow and her
name is now Gloria Walthew Wood,

16:10.633 --> 16:15.376
and she agreed when we
contacted her just on a dare,

16:15.400 --> 16:17.176
as it were, to take a DNA test.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.309
ADLON: Stop it.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.442
GATES: Yeah.

16:19.466 --> 16:21.509
So, I'm going to show
you your mother's DNA

16:21.533 --> 16:23.442
compared to Gloria's DNA.

16:23.466 --> 16:24.776
ADLON: Ok.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.976
GATES: And what we're going
to do is for the parts of

16:27.000 --> 16:30.176
Marina and Gloria's DNA
that are identical,

16:30.200 --> 16:31.809
they will be colored in red.

16:31.833 --> 16:33.276
ADLON: Okay.
GATES: Alright.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.942
So, when you turn this page
you're going to be looking

16:34.966 --> 16:36.842
for red, all right.

16:36.866 --> 16:40.376
And the more red you see
the more closely your mom and

16:40.400 --> 16:44.542
subsequently you are related
to this wonderful person in

16:44.566 --> 16:46.576
upstate New York named Gloria.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.076
ADLON: Gloria.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.009
GATES: Are you ready?

16:49.033 --> 16:49.977
ADLON: Yes.

16:50.001 --> 16:51.809
GATES: Would you
please turn the page?

16:51.833 --> 16:53.009
ADLON: Oh, my god.

16:53.033 --> 16:54.700
How much red is
there going to be?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.309
GATES: How much
red do you see?

16:56.333 --> 16:58.009
Just glancing all down.

16:58.033 --> 17:01.100
ADLON: A lot. A lot.

17:01.433 --> 17:05.042
GATES: Pamela, your mother
and Gloria Walthew Wood share

17:05.066 --> 17:11.542
about 25% of their total DNA
plus they share their entire

17:11.566 --> 17:13.909
paternal X chromosome.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.642
So you know what that means?

17:15.666 --> 17:17.176
ADLON: That's?

17:17.200 --> 17:20.742
GATES: Gloria is your
mother's half-sister.

17:20.766 --> 17:21.809
ADLON: Oh, my god.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.676
This is crazy.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.633
(crying.)

17:28.333 --> 17:31.476
GATES: Your mom's got a sister
and she's alive and well

17:31.500 --> 17:32.909
and she's 83 years old.

17:32.933 --> 17:35.476
ADLON: My mother's
going to be so happy.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.433
She's going to be so happy.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.809
GATES: Pamela's mother
was indeed in for

17:40.833 --> 17:42.909
a great deal of joy.

17:42.933 --> 17:46.309
Thanks to Gloria, we'd not
only solved a mystery that had

17:46.333 --> 17:49.742
haunted her for decades, we
were actually able to bring

17:49.766 --> 17:52.966
her face-to-face with
her biological father.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.242
ADLON: Oh, my god.

17:57.266 --> 17:58.642
GATES: Take a good look.

17:58.666 --> 18:00.542
ADLON: Oh, my god.

18:00.566 --> 18:03.809
GATES: You are looking at your
grandfather Joseph Walthew.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.309
ADLON: Oh, this
is just the best. Wow.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.742
I'm so happy that I get
to give this to my mom.

18:10.766 --> 18:11.809
GATES: I am, too.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.109
You just
discovered a whole new...

18:13.133 --> 18:14.110
ADLON: Yes.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.209
GATES: A whole new family.

18:15.233 --> 18:16.642
ADLON: It's really, really cool.

18:16.666 --> 18:18.309
GATES: What's your mom going to
say when she sees that picture?

18:18.333 --> 18:20.942
ADLON: Freak out.
Oh, I can't wait.

18:20.966 --> 18:25.300
I just can't. Yes.
This is awesome.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.476
GATES: Pamela wondered
how her grandparents met.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.376
We can't be certain, but we
know that Joseph worked as a

18:33.400 --> 18:36.842
bus driver in Birkenhead, and
also made deliveries for the

18:36.866 --> 18:40.976
post office, jobs that could
easily have put him in contact

18:41.000 --> 18:43.366
with Pamela's
grandmother Phyllis.

18:44.233 --> 18:46.809
We also suspect that both
parties wanted to keep their

18:46.833 --> 18:49.309
relationship a secret.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.676
Not only was Phyllis married,

18:51.700 --> 18:54.842
but Joseph himself
was likely engaged.

18:54.866 --> 18:58.242
He'd marry a woman named
Emily mercer about seven months

18:58.266 --> 19:01.833
after Marina was conceived.

19:02.333 --> 19:05.400
ADLON: Holy crap.
Wait, what?

19:05.700 --> 19:10.009
GATES: Joseph got married two
months before Marina was born.

19:10.033 --> 19:12.442
ADLON: Oh, damn.

19:12.466 --> 19:15.176
GATES: So, the act would have
been seven months before

19:15.200 --> 19:16.276
he got married, right.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.476
Nine months.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.100
ADLON: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Well, wow.

19:23.533 --> 19:27.476
GATES: Pamela's grandfather
didn't stay married for long.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.542
He and Emily divorced
around 1952 and Joseph

19:31.566 --> 19:35.100
never remarried or had
any other children,

19:35.433 --> 19:38.142
at least not as far as we know.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.442
As for Pamela's
grandmother Phyllis,

19:40.466 --> 19:42.442
her marriage to
Leonard Leece was,

19:42.466 --> 19:45.976
reportedly, a very unhappy one,

19:46.000 --> 19:50.400
but it endured until
Leonard's death in 1970.

19:51.033 --> 19:54.776
Phyllis, herself,
died seven years later.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.342
And there's no evidence
that she and Joseph ever

19:57.366 --> 20:01.276
re-connected, but Pamela
remembers Phyllis as a

20:01.300 --> 20:06.309
creative, independent woman,
and it heartened her to think

20:06.333 --> 20:09.609
that her grandmother had
followed her passions,

20:09.633 --> 20:12.600
however briefly, in her youth.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.742
ADLON: It makes sense
because we are very like

20:16.766 --> 20:18.709
outside the box people.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.609
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

20:20.633 --> 20:25.966
ADLON: Um, and she
wouldn't be afraid of that

20:26.533 --> 20:28.342
but I guess the
rest of the family like

20:28.366 --> 20:30.442
wanted to cover it up.

20:30.466 --> 20:32.233
Probably she had to, too.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.242
GATES: There's one more
thing I want to show you

20:35.266 --> 20:36.342
before we move on...

20:36.366 --> 20:37.376
ADLON: Okay.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.742
GATES: And I
think you'll like it.

20:38.766 --> 20:39.942
Would you please turn the page?

20:39.966 --> 20:41.700
ADLON: Yes.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.442
Is that Gloria?

20:43.466 --> 20:45.109
GATES: That is your aunt.

20:45.133 --> 20:47.276
That is your
mother's half-sister.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.200
ADLON: I love her.
Thank you, Gloria.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.642
GATES: She is excited to
meet you and to meet your mom.

20:53.666 --> 20:55.142
ADLON: Really?

20:55.166 --> 20:57.942
GATES: Now, she doesn't know
who you are or who your mom is

20:57.966 --> 21:02.676
but Gloria now knows that she
has a mysterious half-sister.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.709
Gloria's exact response,

21:04.733 --> 21:08.109
when she was told
about the DNA match was,

21:08.133 --> 21:10.376
a brief pause
and then an excited,

21:10.400 --> 21:13.542
'isn't that wonderful.'
isn't that great?

21:13.566 --> 21:16.533
ADLON: That's what I think, too.

21:17.300 --> 21:20.609
GATES: Much like Pamela,
Kathryn Hahn had a scandal in

21:20.633 --> 21:24.109
her family tree, only this
one was buried even deeper

21:24.133 --> 21:25.700
in the past.

21:26.766 --> 21:30.476
The story begins in 19th
century Germany with Kathryn's

21:30.500 --> 21:34.642
third great-grandparents,
Wilhelm Lünenschloss and

21:34.666 --> 21:36.466
Elizabeth Thernes.

21:37.266 --> 21:40.742
They are the original
immigrants on this branch of

21:40.766 --> 21:44.176
Kathryn's family tree, and two
of her very first ancestors to

21:44.200 --> 21:46.633
put down roots in America.

21:46.933 --> 21:50.676
They would end up settling
in Wisconsin in the 1850s,

21:50.700 --> 21:54.000
a common destination for
German immigrants at the time.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.309
But a quick glance at their
ages showed that they were

21:57.333 --> 21:59.800
not a typical couple.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.409
As you could see, Wilhelm was
20 years older than Elizabeth.

22:03.433 --> 22:04.442
HAHN: Yes.

22:04.466 --> 22:05.609
GATES: Did you know that?

22:05.633 --> 22:07.709
HAHN: No, I did not.

22:07.733 --> 22:10.242
GATES: Now, I understand that
there's a family story

22:10.266 --> 22:11.476
about Wilhelm.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.242
Apparently, he was born in
Germany and he left for the

22:14.266 --> 22:17.009
United States under some
very unusual circumstances.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.042
HAHN: Uh-oh.

22:18.066 --> 22:19.043
GATES: Do you know this story?

22:19.067 --> 22:20.842
HAHN: Please illuminate.

22:20.866 --> 22:22.276
GATES: Okay.

22:22.300 --> 22:26.142
Your mother's brother, Eddie,
told us that your ancestor had

22:26.166 --> 22:29.242
to leave Germany because he
married a french girl and

22:29.266 --> 22:30.376
created a scandal.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.709
HAHN: Oh!

22:31.733 --> 22:35.176
GATES: So we wanted to see
if this scandal was true.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.076
And we found quite a lot.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.476
HAHN: Oh, goodness.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.576
GATES: Records reveal
that Kathryn's third great

22:41.600 --> 22:46.042
grandfather, Willhelm,
was born in 1816 in Barmen,

22:46.066 --> 22:50.809
a small city in what was then
the German state of Prussia.

22:50.833 --> 22:53.009
His father was a factory worker,

22:53.033 --> 22:55.409
but Wilhelm became a baker.

22:55.433 --> 22:58.842
And by 1840, we
found him in cologne,

22:58.866 --> 23:02.533
a larger city, where he
married and started a family.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.476
He seemed to be thriving.

23:05.500 --> 23:09.533
But his wedding record
revealed something unexpected.

23:10.566 --> 23:15.000
Wilhelm is marrying a woman
named Katerina Gertrud Himberg,

23:15.900 --> 23:18.309
who is not your third
great grandmother Elizabeth...

23:18.333 --> 23:19.476
HAHN: No.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.176
GATES: He's
marrying another woman.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.376
Have you ever heard
anything about this?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.343
HAHN: No.

23:23.367 --> 23:24.376
GATES: All right.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.742
Would you please turn the page?

23:25.766 --> 23:27.809
This is another record
from cologne that's dated,

23:27.833 --> 23:29.376
the 4th of July, 1853.

Would you please read

By this time, Wilhelm and
Katerina had five other

children, who ranged in age

GATES: That's, so what do you
think their family life is like?

HAHN: Yes.
GATES: Yeah.

birth record we just saw to
the 1860 federal census for

24:27.466 --> 24:28.942
Ithaca, Wisconsin.

GATES: So you realize
what has happened in the

intervening seven years?

24:53.966 --> 24:55.609
HAHN: Did he just leave
her and marry someone else?

24:55.633 --> 24:57.776
GATES: Bingo.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.842
That's your third great
grandfather, Wilhelm,

24:59.866 --> 25:03.342
living in Wisconsin,
in another country,

25:03.366 --> 25:07.076
with your own biological
third great grandmother,

Elizabeth, listed here,

HAHN: Frank.

25:16.733 --> 25:17.842
GATES: You got it.

25:17.866 --> 25:20.633
HAHN: Oh, wow.

25:22.066 --> 25:24.309
GATES: We now set out to
discover how Wilhelm and

25:24.333 --> 25:27.709
Elizabeth came together,
and whether Kathryn's family

25:27.733 --> 25:31.276
story, that Wilhelm had
married a french woman,

25:31.300 --> 25:33.666
might have held a
grain of truth.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.242
We knew that Elizabeth was
just 17 when she met Wilhelm.

25:38.266 --> 25:41.409
And we knew that
her surname, Thernes,

25:41.433 --> 25:44.376
is not invariably
of German origin.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.476
Could she have been
a young Frenchwoman,

25:46.500 --> 25:49.709
traveling through Prussia
when she caught his eye?

25:49.733 --> 25:53.433
The reality proved
to be more mundane.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.476
So these are excerpts from
the city directory of

25:56.500 --> 25:58.476
the wonderful
metropolis of cologne,

25:58.500 --> 26:00.709
from the year 1854.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.609
And as you could
see on the left,

26:02.633 --> 26:05.509
Wilhelm and his wife, Katerina,

26:05.533 --> 26:08.276
are living at Ergenstrasse 50.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.242
And on the right, you could
see the name of the man who

26:11.266 --> 26:14.976
lived at Ergenstrasse
48, just a few doors down.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.042
Could you read his surname?

26:17.066 --> 26:19.309
HAHN: Anton Thernes.

26:19.333 --> 26:20.842
GATES: And whose

HAHN: Hers.

26:22.133 --> 26:23.442
GATES: That's right.
HAHN: Yes.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.242
HAHN: Ohhh.

26:26.266 --> 26:30.009
GATES: Anton Thernes was
Elizabeth's or Eliza's father.

26:30.033 --> 26:31.642
So you know what this means.

26:31.666 --> 26:34.509
Elizabeth was the daughter
of Wilhelm's neighbor.

26:34.533 --> 26:35.876
HAHN: God!

26:35.900 --> 26:38.376
There's so much to
unpack right there.

26:38.400 --> 26:43.033
Eliza, Elizabeth.
I mean, wow.

26:43.766 --> 26:46.142
That is so complicated.

26:46.166 --> 26:47.842
GATES: Well, one
thing you should know,

26:47.866 --> 26:49.042
that you don't have to
worry about in the

26:49.066 --> 26:50.409
guilt, uh, chart.

26:50.433 --> 26:53.276
HAHN: No guilt.
Just, like, "What?!"

26:53.300 --> 26:55.576
GATES: 17-year-olds
were allowed to marry.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.942
HAHN: Oh, I'm sure
14-year-olds were.

26:57.966 --> 26:59.642
It's a whole thing.

26:59.666 --> 27:01.409
GATES: There was nothing
at all unusual about a

27:01.433 --> 27:02.676
17-year-year old, at that time.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.509
HAHN: I'm sure Anton was like,
"Please. Take her."

27:05.533 --> 27:07.042
It was a whole different time.

27:07.066 --> 27:07.843
GATES: Yeah.

27:07.867 --> 27:09.142
HAHN: Anton Thernes.

27:09.166 --> 27:10.176
GATES: What a story.

HAHN: What a freaking story!
What a story!

27:16.766 --> 27:18.842
GATES: There was still a
question in front of us:

27:18.866 --> 27:21.633
what happened to the family
that Wilhelm left behind?

27:23.166 --> 27:26.076
We found the answer in the
death notice of his German

27:26.100 --> 27:31.276
wife, Katerina, which was
filed in 1892 by one of

27:31.300 --> 27:33.300
Wilhelm's German daughters.

27:33.900 --> 27:37.109
It indicates that Katerina
never remarried or left

27:37.133 --> 27:41.676
cologne, and states that
almost 40 years after his

27:41.700 --> 27:46.142
departure, Wilhelm's
whereabouts remained

27:46.166 --> 27:47.633
a mystery.

HAHN: Oh, damn it. Wilhelm!

27:53.566 --> 27:54.909
GATES: She lived
the rest of her life,

27:54.933 --> 28:00.533

You know, this reads to me
that she never let it go.

28:16.833 --> 28:18.076
GATES: Nope, she
never let it go.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.342

that in this death notice.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.276
GATES: Yeah. They go,

whether Wilhelm ever regretted

28:32.500 --> 28:35.566
leaving his wife and
children behind in Germany.

28:36.166 --> 28:38.042
There's no way to
know for certain,

28:38.066 --> 28:42.209
but his obituary, which
celebrates his life in detail,

28:42.233 --> 28:44.566
contains a telling clue.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.409
HAHN: "He was esteemed

Pamela Adlon to her biological

30:25.900 --> 30:30.776
grandfather, uncovering a
host of secrets in the small

30:30.800 --> 30:33.876
English city where
her mother grew up.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.976
Now, turning to
Pamela's paternal roots,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.242
we found ourselves in a
very different place,

30:40.266 --> 30:44.566
confronting secrets of
a very different nature.

30:44.800 --> 30:49.076
Pamela's father descends
from eastern European Jews,

30:49.100 --> 30:51.876
and Pamela told me that while
she felt connected to her

30:51.900 --> 30:55.276
Jewish ancestors, the family
never spoke about their past,

30:55.300 --> 30:59.600
so she knows almost
nothing about their lives.

31:00.900 --> 31:04.833
We set out to change that,
starting with the 1910 census

31:05.300 --> 31:08.100
for the town of
Medford, Massachusetts,

31:08.400 --> 31:11.833
where Pamela's grandfather,
Harry Segall, was raised.

31:14.166 --> 31:15.442
ADLON: Man.

31:15.466 --> 31:18.609
"Frank Segall,
head of the family.

31:18.633 --> 31:21.233
Age, 46.
Place of birth, Russia.

31:22.100 --> 31:24.176
Native language, Yiddish."

31:24.200 --> 31:25.143
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

31:25.167 --> 31:28.100
ADLON: "Occupation, janitor."
Respect.

31:28.700 --> 31:34.466
Fanny, awe, his wife, age 36.
Place of birth, Russia.

31:35.500 --> 31:39.033
Native language, Yiddish.
Love that.

31:39.733 --> 31:42.176
Year of immigration 1895.

31:42.200 --> 31:46.776
Dora, daughter, age 12.
Place of birth, Massachusetts.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.709
Harry, son, age nine.

31:48.733 --> 31:50.609
Place of birth,
Massachusetts."

31:50.633 --> 31:52.542
GATES: That is your
grandfather Harry when he was

31:52.566 --> 31:55.876
nine years old listed in the
household of his parents in

31:55.900 --> 31:58.376
the federal census and
his parents are your

31:58.400 --> 32:01.076
great-grandparents,
Frank and Fanny Segall.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.109
ADLON: Wow!

32:02.133 --> 32:03.509
GATES: Have you heard
of Frank and Fanny?

32:03.533 --> 32:04.542
ADLON: No.

32:04.566 --> 32:05.510
GATES: Really?

32:05.534 --> 32:08.009
ADLON: I mean Frank
is a family name.

32:08.033 --> 32:10.609
GATES: But if I said
what are the names of

32:10.633 --> 32:11.343
your great-grandparents?

32:11.367 --> 32:12.476
ADLON: Oh, no.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.142
GATES: Well, you just met
your great-grandparents.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.700
ADLON: That's incredible.

32:17.533 --> 32:20.542
GATES: This census indicates
that Frank Segall was born in

32:20.566 --> 32:24.300
Russia sometime around 1864.

32:24.966 --> 32:27.042
From a genealogical perspective,

32:27.066 --> 32:30.276
this information
wasn't terribly useful.

32:30.300 --> 32:33.209
Russia, at the time,
was a huge empire,

32:33.233 --> 32:36.642
and no other documents named
Frank's birthplace with any

32:36.666 --> 32:39.109
greater specificity.

32:39.133 --> 32:41.876
It seemed like we'd
hit a brick wall.

32:41.900 --> 32:44.842
But then, expanding our search,

32:44.866 --> 32:48.542
we uncovered a U.S. Army
draft registration card

32:48.566 --> 32:51.242
for Frank's younger
brother Samuel.

32:51.266 --> 32:54.876
It indicated that Samuel was
born in a town called Gritsev,

32:54.900 --> 32:58.333
and, suddenly, that
brick wall collapsed,

32:59.733 --> 33:02.609
can you see in what modern-day
country the town is?

33:02.633 --> 33:03.709
ADLON: Ukraine.

33:03.733 --> 33:04.876
GATES: Ukraine.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.942
Frank came from the area
of the Russian empire

33:06.966 --> 33:08.076
that's now Ukraine.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.176
ADLON: Wow.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.509
GATES: Have you
ever been to Ukraine?

33:10.533 --> 33:11.477
ADLON: No.

33:11.501 --> 33:13.776
GATES: No. Well,
please turn the page.

33:13.800 --> 33:19.033
ADLON: Wow.
Belarus. I had...

33:19.366 --> 33:22.076
A guy came to fix
my dishwasher once.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.366
He was from Belarus.
He was a scary man.

33:26.900 --> 33:30.209
GATES: Pamela, you're looking
at a photo of a gravestone

33:30.233 --> 33:33.309
taken around 1912,
likely in Gritsev,

33:33.333 --> 33:35.842
would you please read
the translated section of

33:35.866 --> 33:38.276
the Hebrew
inscription on the stone?

33:38.300 --> 33:39.809
ADLON: Okay. Good.

33:39.833 --> 33:42.642
I was having PTSD of Hebrew
school and I thought you were

33:42.666 --> 33:45.500
going to make me read
the Hebrew on the stone.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.176
"Here is buried a
pure and honest man.

33:49.200 --> 33:55.133
He was famous rabbi
Yitzhak son of Tzvi Halevy."

33:55.666 --> 33:58.542
GATES: Yitzhak was the father
of your great-grandfather

33:58.566 --> 34:00.142
Frank Segall.

34:00.166 --> 34:03.642
You're looking at your great-
great-grandfather's gravestone.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.742
ADLON: And he was a rabbi.

34:04.766 --> 34:06.576
GATES: He was a rabbi, dear.
You just read it.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.433
ADLON: Yes.
Oh, my god.

34:10.933 --> 34:12.309
GATES: Were you bat mizvahed?

34:12.333 --> 34:16.842
ADLON: I mean the amount
of time I spent in temple.

34:16.866 --> 34:21.209
If somebody had just
said to me your great,

34:21.233 --> 34:22.342
my great-great?

34:22.366 --> 34:23.709
GATES:
Great-great-grandfather.

34:23.733 --> 34:25.942
ADLON: Was a rabbi I
would have been like,

34:25.966 --> 34:30.542
oh, wait, let me catch up
to this sermon right now.

34:30.566 --> 34:32.466
It's mind-blowing.

34:34.200 --> 34:36.309
GATES: This photo was likely
taken around the time of

34:36.333 --> 34:39.433
Yitzhak's death in 1912.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.742
The women in it
are his daughters,

34:41.766 --> 34:43.800
Zhenya and Menikha.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.009
They are the younger sisters

34:46.033 --> 34:48.509
of Pamela's
great-grandfather, Frank.

34:48.533 --> 34:51.133
And thus Pamela's
great-grand aunts.

34:53.066 --> 34:54.809
ADLON: Oh, my god.

34:54.833 --> 34:56.409
GATES: See any
family resemblances?

34:56.433 --> 34:58.142
ADLON: They're so beautiful.

34:58.166 --> 35:01.909
No. I mean they almost
look like Italian.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.133
GATES: Or maybe Russian.

35:04.966 --> 35:07.342
(laughter)

35:07.366 --> 35:08.509
Maybe Ukrainian.

35:08.533 --> 35:11.642
ADLON: Oh, wait.
Oh, wait.

35:11.666 --> 35:13.966
Um, yes, that's what I meant.

35:16.833 --> 35:20.733
GATES: Pamela had never heard
of either Zhenya or Menikha,

35:21.366 --> 35:23.966
and we soon uncovered
the likely reason why.

35:24.833 --> 35:28.342
Unlike Frank and three
of their other siblings,

35:28.366 --> 35:31.900
neither of the sisters
chose to immigrate to America.

35:32.266 --> 35:35.666
And that decision
would cost them dearly.

35:36.066 --> 35:39.800
In 1941, Nazi
Germany invaded Ukraine,

35:40.666 --> 35:43.676
which was then part
of the Soviet Union,

35:43.700 --> 35:46.700
and began to exterminate
its Jewish population.

35:47.866 --> 35:50.642
We don't know what
happened to Zhenya,

35:50.666 --> 35:54.109
but her sister Menikha was
evacuated to the interior of

35:54.133 --> 35:58.142
Russia because her
husband, a technician,

35:58.166 --> 36:01.709
and two of her daughters, were
considered to be essential to

36:01.733 --> 36:04.366
the soviet war effort.

36:04.633 --> 36:08.642
One of her daughters, however,
a woman named Clara Birman,

36:08.666 --> 36:10.900
chose to stay behind.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.976
GATES: Her name is nowhere
on the list of those

36:14.000 --> 36:15.309
who were evacuated.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.676
ADLON: Oh.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.876
GATES: So, we wanted to
find out what happened to her.

36:18.900 --> 36:19.843
ADLON: Yeah.

36:19.867 --> 36:21.442
GATES: We feared
for the worst, of course.

36:21.466 --> 36:23.076
Could you please turn the page?

36:23.100 --> 36:25.709
Pamela, that photograph
was taken just before the

36:25.733 --> 36:28.600
German invasion of the
Soviet Union in 1941.

36:28.933 --> 36:32.276
It shows Clara Birman
with her Ukrainian husband,

36:32.300 --> 36:35.576
Anatoly and their two
young children: Vladimir,

36:35.600 --> 36:40.266
born in 1940, and
Lyudmila, born in 1938.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.342
ADLON: Oh, my god.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.509
GATES: Did you ever hear
of any of these people?

36:43.533 --> 36:45.076
ADLON: Never.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.409
GATES: Well, upon the German
invasion of the Soviet Union,

36:47.433 --> 36:51.709
Clara's husband, Anatoly was
activated for military duty

36:51.733 --> 36:54.042
and before he reported he took
Clara and the children to stay

36:54.066 --> 36:57.509
with his mother in one of the
ethnically Ukrainian villages

36:57.533 --> 36:59.476
outside of Kiev.

36:59.500 --> 37:04.300
No one but Anatoly's mother
knew that Clara was Jewish.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.209
ADLON: Wow.

37:06.233 --> 37:07.642
GATES: Well,
guess what happened?

37:07.666 --> 37:11.276
When the German army reached
the village her mother-in-law

37:11.300 --> 37:14.476
gave her and the children up.

37:14.500 --> 37:18.876
ADLON: Oh, she told on them.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.876
She narked on their Jewishness.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.142
GATES: Yeah.

37:23.166 --> 37:26.642
ADLON: Wow. His mom?

37:26.666 --> 37:29.576
GATES: His mom.
She gave them up.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.933
ADLON: Why?

37:32.300 --> 37:34.009
GATES: The answer to
Pamela's question is part

37:34.033 --> 37:36.209
of a terrible history.

37:36.233 --> 37:40.742
The nazis, tapping into a
current of anti-Semitism as

37:40.766 --> 37:44.866
old as the middle ages, found
many willing collaborators.

37:45.733 --> 37:49.742
Simply put: the holocaust
was the culmination of

37:49.766 --> 37:52.166
centuries of hatred.

37:52.700 --> 37:55.842
Even so it's
appalling to contemplate.

37:55.866 --> 37:59.733
And Pamela was now
compelled to do so.

38:00.200 --> 38:04.176
According to a family friend,
Clara Birman and her children

38:04.200 --> 38:08.076
were among the roughly
33,000 Jewish people who were

38:08.100 --> 38:12.566
massacred in a large ravine
on the outskirts of Kiev,

38:13.200 --> 38:16.866
the capital city of Ukraine.

38:18.133 --> 38:20.809
Clara was 27 when
she was murdered.

38:20.833 --> 38:22.742
Her daughter was
three years old,

38:22.766 --> 38:25.242
her son one year old.

38:25.266 --> 38:28.576
Did you know that you had a
tangible family connection to

38:28.600 --> 38:29.709
the holocaust?

38:29.733 --> 38:34.666
ADLON: No. Not at all.
Not at all.

38:39.433 --> 38:44.409
And I was hoping that
they could still be alive.

38:44.433 --> 38:46.076
GATES: Yeah.

38:46.100 --> 38:47.442
ADLON: The babies.

38:47.466 --> 38:50.233
GATES: Yeah.

38:50.433 --> 38:52.433
(sighs)

38:52.733 --> 38:56.076
There is a small
grace note to this story,

38:56.100 --> 38:59.476
Clara's mother
Menikha survived the war,

38:59.500 --> 39:03.666
returned to Ukraine, and
was able to rebuild her life.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.400
She died in Kiev on may 6, 1969
at the age of 85,

39:12.133 --> 39:15.266
when Pamela was
about three years old.

39:16.766 --> 39:19.842
GATES: What's it like to learn
that you had family in Ukraine

39:19.866 --> 39:24.042
as recently as the 1960s?

39:24.066 --> 39:25.342
ADLON: That's nuts.

39:25.366 --> 39:26.609
GATES: Yeah.

39:26.633 --> 39:30.666
ADLON: That's nuts.
I mean I'm just, yeah.

39:33.433 --> 39:35.909
GATES: Your great-grandfather
Frank died right around the

39:35.933 --> 39:39.609
time of the German
invasion of soviet Ukraine.

39:39.633 --> 39:43.409
Frank's son, your grandfather
Harry died in Boston the same

39:43.433 --> 39:47.276
year as his aunt
Menikha died in Ukraine.

39:47.300 --> 39:48.376
ADLON: No.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.476
GATES: Yeah.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.909
ADLON: Harry died in 1969?

39:50.933 --> 39:52.376
GATES: Yeah. In Boston.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.209
ADLON: Oh, god.
He was a funny guy.

39:55.233 --> 39:57.076
GATES: Do you think your
grandfather knew that he

39:57.100 --> 40:00.800
had such close
relatives in Ukraine?

40:01.800 --> 40:03.709
ADLON: Maybe he did.

40:03.733 --> 40:04.976
GATES: I wonder.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.676
ADLON: I wonder. I don't...

40:06.700 --> 40:10.109
GATES: What's it like for
you to learn this part of

40:10.133 --> 40:13.266
your father's family story?

40:14.533 --> 40:18.133
ADLON: What's, what's so...

40:19.500 --> 40:23.800
Incredible to me is
how little families know

40:25.033 --> 40:31.066
about their stories and how
we just accept the crumbs and

40:32.333 --> 40:36.433
how, you know,

40:36.700 --> 40:39.033
we don't preserve our histories,

40:40.200 --> 40:45.233
you know, and how I think
people need to know this.

40:45.700 --> 40:50.309
Seeing all of these people,
that's what makes you realize

40:50.333 --> 40:52.542
that everybody is important.

40:52.566 --> 40:54.142
GATES: Right.

40:54.166 --> 40:55.642
ADLON: It's, it's...

40:55.666 --> 40:59.242
And how precious life is.

40:59.266 --> 41:02.709
It's just absolutely incredible.

41:02.733 --> 41:05.042
All of us are against all odds.

41:05.066 --> 41:07.176
GATES: Yes. All of us.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.309
Our survival has
been against all odds.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.366
ADLON: Yes. It's a miracle.

41:12.100 --> 41:15.166
GATES: We'd already explored
Kathryn Hahn's maternal roots,

41:15.900 --> 41:18.276
revealing how her third
great-grandfather came to

41:18.300 --> 41:22.300
America, leaving a wife
and six children behind.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.342
Now, turning to
Kathryn's father's ancestry,

41:26.366 --> 41:30.442
we had another story to tell,
with similar themes,

41:30.466 --> 41:33.066
but a much happier ending.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.742
It began with a ship that
arrived in New York from

41:35.766 --> 41:39.966
Ireland on December 9th, 1882.

41:40.233 --> 41:43.276
On board, was Kathryn's
great-great-grandmother,

41:43.300 --> 41:47.642
Mary O'Connell, traveling on
her own with six young children.

41:47.666 --> 41:50.900
Which raised a question:
where was their father?

41:51.733 --> 41:54.442
We knew his name,
John O'Connell, but

41:54.466 --> 41:58.676
we couldn't find him anywhere
on the passenger list.

41:58.700 --> 42:01.676
HAHN: And she,
there was no husband?

42:01.700 --> 42:03.176
GATES: That's right.
HAHN: Partner.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.609
GATES: So, the
husband's missing.

42:04.633 --> 42:07.009
Any idea why?
Just take a guess.

42:07.033 --> 42:07.977
HAHN: He died.

42:08.001 --> 42:09.709
GATES: That's a
good guess, but nope.

42:09.733 --> 42:11.276
And he didn't run away
with a 17-year-old...

42:11.300 --> 42:12.509
HAHN: Yeah, right.

42:12.533 --> 42:14.442
I was gonna say he's in
Wisconsin with a 17-year-old.

42:14.466 --> 42:15.509
GATES: Yeah.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.642
Yeah, at the same,
at the same bakery.

42:17.666 --> 42:18.809
HAHN: Right, exactly.

42:18.833 --> 42:20.009
GATES: No. Good story.

42:20.033 --> 42:22.309
He had emigrated to
the states around 1880,

42:22.333 --> 42:23.542
two years before.

42:23.566 --> 42:24.676
HAHN: Oh, to set up shop.

42:24.700 --> 42:25.776
GATES: Yeah.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.042
Likely to establish roots
and send money back home

42:28.066 --> 42:30.042
to pay for their passage.

42:30.066 --> 42:31.809
And that was common
among immigrant families.

42:31.833 --> 42:32.909
HAHN: Yes.

42:32.933 --> 42:34.542
GATES: And it must have
placed a great burden on

42:34.566 --> 42:35.776
both of them.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.409
But still, I think I'd
rather be John than Mary.

42:37.433 --> 42:38.542
HAHN: Yes.

42:38.566 --> 42:40.142
GATES: On a ship
with all those kids.

42:40.166 --> 42:42.066
HAHN: Wow.

42:42.666 --> 42:45.942
GATES: As it turns out, Mary's
husband wasn't the only member

42:45.966 --> 42:48.433
of her family waiting
for her in America.

42:49.266 --> 42:52.342
Her arrival marked the
close of a long and likely

42:52.366 --> 42:55.100
painful period in her life.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.676
Census records
revealed that Mary's parents,

42:57.700 --> 43:03.000
Patrick and Honora Daly, had
settled in Michigan in 1860.

43:04.266 --> 43:08.909
At the time, Mary would
have been about 13 years old.

43:08.933 --> 43:11.376
So you know what
this record means?

43:11.400 --> 43:14.076
It means that when your third
great-grandparents immigrated

43:14.100 --> 43:17.009
to the United States they
left their daughter Mary

43:17.033 --> 43:19.342
behind in Ireland.

43:19.366 --> 43:22.576
And we don't know why.
Likely it was economic.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.876
HAHN: Yes.

43:23.900 --> 43:25.276
GATES: They probably couldn't
afford to bring her so they

43:25.300 --> 43:26.476
had to make choices.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.909
HAHN: God.

43:27.933 --> 43:31.309
GATES: She likely stayed
with her grandparents back in

43:31.333 --> 43:34.509
Ireland, you know, waiting
for them to bring her over.

43:34.533 --> 43:35.609
HAHN: Yes.

43:35.633 --> 43:38.542
GATES: But that had
to be heart wrenching.

43:38.566 --> 43:40.276
HAHN: I've got a lot
of that in my family.

43:40.300 --> 43:41.409
GATES: Yup.

43:41.433 --> 43:43.566
HAHN: Separation.

43:44.166 --> 43:46.842
GATES: This story
was about to darken.

43:46.866 --> 43:50.676
Digging deeper, we realized
that Mary's parents emigrated

43:50.700 --> 43:56.309
much earlier than 1860, likely
when Mary was very young,

43:56.333 --> 43:58.833
around the year 1849.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.042
At the time,

44:01.066 --> 44:04.009
Ireland was in the midst of
the great potato famine,

44:04.033 --> 44:07.276
a cataclysm that claimed
the lives of roughly

44:07.300 --> 44:11.042
one million people, and drove
another two million to leave

44:11.066 --> 44:15.109
the country, meaning that
Mary grew up surrounded by

44:15.133 --> 44:17.809
a massive amount of suffering.

44:17.833 --> 44:23.066
Waiting, and likely praying
to join her parents in America.

44:24.533 --> 44:27.109
HAHN: Whew.
That sounds intense.

44:27.133 --> 44:28.242
GATES: Well, guess what?

44:28.266 --> 44:29.243
HAHN: What?

44:29.267 --> 44:31.942
GATES: She waited 30 years.

44:31.966 --> 44:36.566
She was separated from
her parents for 30 years.

44:37.766 --> 44:41.742
HAHN: Yeah.
Oh wow, okay.

44:41.766 --> 44:44.742
GATES: Patrick and
Honora even had a child,

44:44.766 --> 44:47.642
Mary's younger brother David,
while they were living here

44:47.666 --> 44:49.809
and she was living back there.

44:49.833 --> 44:52.776
HAHN: Hmm.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.342
GATES: It would be so long
David died before his sister

44:55.366 --> 44:58.842
Mary finally was able to
immigrate to the United States.

44:58.866 --> 45:00.742
HAHN: Unh-uh.

45:00.766 --> 45:02.909
GATES: They had
David, David dies.

45:02.933 --> 45:05.009
Imagine having a baby brother
on the other side of the

45:05.033 --> 45:08.609
Atlantic whom you
would never meet?

45:08.633 --> 45:13.733
HAHN: Mmm, I mean, it's
interesting to me because I'm

45:14.033 --> 45:18.276
having echoes of my maternal
side and the family that I...

45:18.300 --> 45:19.376
GATES: Oh yeah.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.842
HAHN: I just keep
seeing that ocean between...

45:20.866 --> 45:22.109
GATES: That's true.

45:22.133 --> 45:25.100
HAHN: Families.
That is really profound.

45:25.900 --> 45:29.942
GATES: Fortunately, the ocean
between Mary and her parents

45:29.966 --> 45:34.909
would close in 1882 when
finally Mary arrived in the

45:34.933 --> 45:38.833
United States, it's difficult
even to imagine what that

45:39.233 --> 45:43.166
reunion was like, or what
emotions remained unspoken.

45:43.966 --> 45:45.842
But we found an obituary,

45:45.866 --> 45:48.176
published almost 20 years later,

45:48.200 --> 45:50.976
which suggests that
separation didn't break

45:51.000 --> 45:53.100
the family's bonds.

45:53.866 --> 45:57.909
HAHN: "Mrs. Nora Daly died at
607 Pine Street last night,

45:57.933 --> 45:59.609
age 77 years.

45:59.633 --> 46:03.109
During the past two years
she's lived with her daughter,

46:03.133 --> 46:06.833
Mrs. Mary O'Connell,
at Lima, Ohio."

46:07.566 --> 46:10.276
GATES: Nora is,
of course Honora.

46:10.300 --> 46:13.209
And Honora, here listed as Nora,

46:13.233 --> 46:15.642
spent the last years of her
life living with the daughter

46:15.666 --> 46:20.500
she had left behind in
Ireland for over 30 years.

46:21.366 --> 46:25.700
HAHN: Oh my god.
Oh my god.

46:27.733 --> 46:30.409
So she raised,
without her parents,

46:30.433 --> 46:32.509
by herself, six children?

46:32.533 --> 46:33.876
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

46:33.900 --> 46:38.333
HAHN: And then came over
and took care of her mom.

46:38.766 --> 46:40.109
GATES: Mm-hmm.

46:40.133 --> 46:41.342
HAHN: In Lima, Ohio?

46:41.366 --> 46:42.542
GATES: That's right.

46:42.566 --> 46:45.100
HAHN: Hmm.

46:46.033 --> 46:48.076
"During the past few years she
has lived with her daughter,

46:48.100 --> 46:49.476
Mrs. Mary O'Connell, at Lima".

46:49.500 --> 46:51.176
Wow. Yeah.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.342
GATES: Yup.

46:52.366 --> 46:55.209
So do you think they were
making up for lost time?

46:55.233 --> 46:59.966
HAHN: Yeah, I mean, wow,
I'm just still, like...

47:00.666 --> 47:03.166
(gasps)

47:04.833 --> 47:08.109
GATES: We had one more
detail to share with Kathryn.

47:08.133 --> 47:11.042
As we combed through
the archives in Ireland,

47:11.066 --> 47:13.809
we came upon what's
called a "house book"

47:13.833 --> 47:16.542
for the year 1849.

47:16.566 --> 47:20.076
Conducted for tax purposes,
this book records the

47:20.100 --> 47:23.742
owners and conditions of
much of Ireland's property

47:23.766 --> 47:25.142
at the time.

47:25.166 --> 47:27.509
Its entries, for
the town land of Port,

47:27.533 --> 47:29.442
in County Limerick,

47:29.466 --> 47:33.700
allowed us to glimpse a
crucial part of Mary's story.

47:33.900 --> 47:36.209
HAHN: "Name and
description: David Connors.

47:36.233 --> 47:38.876
House: quality letter 3C."

47:38.900 --> 47:41.509
GATES: We believe that this is
the relative who took in your

47:41.533 --> 47:43.409
great-great-grandmother
Mary Daly,

47:43.433 --> 47:46.833
when her parents immigrated
to the United States.

47:47.666 --> 47:50.642
David would have been
Mary's maternal grandfather.

47:50.666 --> 47:54.166
HAHN: Oh.
Oh my god.

47:54.566 --> 47:56.776
GATES: And as you're guessing
from the picture you're

47:56.800 --> 47:59.309
looking at, you see that "3C"?

47:59.333 --> 48:03.009
That was a technical
term to describe the,

48:03.033 --> 48:05.976
uh, nature of the
dwelling in which they lived.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.242
It was a designation
used to rate buildings by

48:08.266 --> 48:09.776
age and materials.

48:09.800 --> 48:14.176
It means Patrick's house would
have had stone or mud walls

48:14.200 --> 48:15.942
with a thatched roof.

48:15.966 --> 48:18.342
And it was old
and out of repair.

48:18.366 --> 48:21.442
And on your left, you can see
an image of what these houses

48:21.466 --> 48:22.676
would have looked like.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.609
Can you imagine having to
live in a house like that?

48:25.633 --> 48:26.909
HAHN: No.

48:26.933 --> 48:30.842
GATES: And remember, 1849, the
year that house book record

48:30.866 --> 48:33.776
was taken was
smack dab in the middle

48:33.800 --> 48:35.642
of the great potato famine.

48:35.666 --> 48:38.033
So it would've been rough.

48:38.366 --> 48:40.876
Now, as Mary grew older, she
would've assumed a caregiving

48:40.900 --> 48:43.676
role for her grandparents
until she married your

48:43.700 --> 48:48.400
great-great-grandfather,
John O'Connell, in 1865.

48:49.333 --> 48:51.876
So, what's it been
like to learn her story?

48:51.900 --> 48:56.400
HAHN: I mean, this is, I,
I'd always known that the,

48:56.600 --> 48:59.542
that I was, you know, Irish,
but I had no idea that it,

48:59.566 --> 49:02.176
that there was a paper
trail that went this far.

49:02.200 --> 49:03.177
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

49:03.201 --> 49:04.809
HAHN: And there
is something very,

49:04.833 --> 49:08.242
um, moving to me
about, about seeing,

49:08.266 --> 49:10.709
these things and these people.

49:10.733 --> 49:15.566
Like, this is, this is,

49:15.833 --> 49:18.566
this is really crazy.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.509
GATES: The paper trail had now
run out for each of my guests.

49:23.533 --> 49:25.109
HAHN: Oh my god.

49:25.133 --> 49:28.333
GATES: It was time to
unfurl their family trees.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.709
Now filled with names

all these people?

49:36.966 --> 49:40.309
HAHN: It really is beautiful.
Just beautiful.

49:40.333 --> 49:42.442
GATES: And our
journey wasn't over.

49:42.466 --> 49:46.142
Turning to DNA, we were
able to add a few more very

49:46.166 --> 49:49.400
surprising names to
their newfound families.

49:50.233 --> 49:53.109
When we compared Pamela's
mother's DNA to that of

49:53.133 --> 49:55.709
other people who have
been in this series,

49:55.733 --> 49:57.976
we found a match,

49:58.000 --> 50:01.866
evidence of a relative that
Pamela didn't know she had.

50:03.166 --> 50:04.609
Close your eyes and make a wish.

50:04.633 --> 50:07.442
Of all the people you know,

ADLON: Are you kidding me?

50:29.866 --> 50:34.476
What how.
I love her so much.

50:34.500 --> 50:38.933
Look. Juicing.
I love her.

50:40.700 --> 50:43.476
GATES: Meryl and Pamela's
mother share an identical

50:43.500 --> 50:46.642
segment of DNA on
their X chromosomes,

50:46.666 --> 50:50.500
meaning that they share a
common distant ancestor.

50:50.933 --> 50:53.309
So, it means if you had an
ideal family tree going back

50:53.333 --> 50:55.709
god knows how long
there would be somebody

50:55.733 --> 50:57.009
on both family trees.

ADLON: This is unbelievable.
That's so cool.

51:02.533 --> 51:05.142
GATES: Kathryn, too,
has a DNA cousin,

51:05.166 --> 51:08.966
one whose identity would
expand her sense of her own.

51:13.233 --> 51:17.009
HAHN: What?
I am so excited!

51:17.033 --> 51:18.476
Wait, what is happening?

51:18.500 --> 51:20.976
GATES: Your mother shares an
identical stretch of DNA

51:21.000 --> 51:24.242
on her fourth chromosome
with actor and director

51:24.266 --> 51:25.742
Regina King.

51:25.766 --> 51:28.242
And since your mother
is related to Regina,

51:28.266 --> 51:30.776
that means you are
related to Regina, too.

51:30.800 --> 51:33.742
Regina is about, like an
average African American,

51:33.766 --> 51:37.676
Regina is 24% European.

This is the best.

51:39.866 --> 51:41.242
I love it.

51:41.266 --> 51:44.076
GATES: And Regina is, her
European lines are descended

51:44.100 --> 51:47.509
almost exactly from the very
same places in Europe from

51:47.533 --> 51:48.842
which you descend.

51:48.866 --> 51:50.766
So that's how you're related.
How about that?
