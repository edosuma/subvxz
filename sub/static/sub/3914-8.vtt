00:09.760 --> 00:10.920
I know I butchered
my people.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.086
And I know the army went in
and took back the memories
before I was discharged.

00:14.556 --> 00:15.762
That was you,
wasn’t it?

00:18.185 --> 00:21.348
So, whatever you've done,
I promise you,
I have done worse.

John, you said it
was important.

going to lead us to him

It can't be
that close already.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.895
LUCY: A stage-four
black rain event has
touched down in Old Town,

12:58.027 --> 13:00.109
sector 113 to 150.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.029
Travel and communications
will be affected
for the duration.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.356
Communications?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.532
What kind of storm
are we talking about?
Lethal.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.156
Company stripped the Badlands
and left a toxic graveyard
behind.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.407
All that pollution,

13:10.540 --> 13:14.158
it builds up until
a heat wave whips it into
an electro-acid rain storm.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.287
Falling on John's head?

13:15.378 --> 13:17.369
He'll be fine at The Royale.
Pree knows his business.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.085
Well, ifthis monster's
what we're facing,
should we stay on Leith

13:22.218 --> 13:23.378
until it passes?

13:24.220 --> 13:25.721
LUCY: Dutch has left
the cargo hold.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.549
Yeah.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.176
Thanks, Lucy.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.973
His blood pressure's falling,
heart rate's up.
Probably internal bleeding.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.895
(MONITOR BEEPING)

13:39.694 --> 13:41.059
JOHN: Pawter.
Damn it.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.486
Hey, maybe back up
a little bit, huh?

13:43.573 --> 13:45.234
You're freaking
the lady out.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.364
Thank you.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.738
(SlGHS)

13:49.871 --> 13:51.407
You okay? Can I
get you anything?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.910
Mesenteric artery's
been nicked.
I need to close it.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.909
I need you to do it.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.413
What?
Your hands are steadier.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.050
It's simple. Just look where
the blood is gushing.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.624
Point it there.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.093
Hold it steady three seconds.
That's all I need
to cauterize it.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.934
Okay. We got it,
we're good.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.564
No, we're not.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.112
There's a hole
in his diaphragm. He can't be
moved until it's fixed.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.614
You want to help?
Get me some alcohol.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.323
Sterilize your tools?

14:34.832 --> 14:35.992
Steady my nerves.

14:39.504 --> 14:40.584
Pree.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.502
Something strong.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.426
How's her headache?
Oh, come on, Pree.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.004
I know withdrawal
when I see it.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.518
So, what is she on?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.853
LUCY: Entering
Westerley orbit.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.644
Lucy, hold us above Old Town
until the storm clears.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.150
It's beautiful.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.322
In a nightmare kind of way.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.072
It usually lasts
an hour or two.
We can wait it out.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.197
Dutch.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.201
At some point,
you're going to have to
stop walking out

15:17.333 --> 15:19.164
of every single room
I walk into.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.627
Let's just do this job.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.171
LUCY: Guidance and propulsion
system disengaged.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.335
Lucy, what are you doing?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.629
I’m afraid / cannot
answer that, Dutch.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.798
(BEEPING)

15:41.524 --> 15:43.139
What the hell
did we pick up?

15:54.036 --> 15:56.573
PAWTER: You don't understand.
It's not usually a problem.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.367
I've always been able
to get Jakk.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.538
You've never gone through
withdrawal, have you?

16:03.546 --> 16:05.252
I use itjust to maintain.
Small doses.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.087
Regular hits. Pure Jakk.
How long?

16:07.717 --> 16:08.706
Since med school.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.046
I tried itjust to get
through finals. But...

16:11.721 --> 16:14.303
You try Jakk once...
You're hooked for
life. Yeah.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.596
(SlGHS)

16:15.725 --> 16:18.216
I'm sorry, John.
I thought I could do this,
but I'm losing my shit.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.896
It Will fiX things.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.053
With a fiX.

16:23.566 --> 16:24.555
You can't go out there.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.563
lfyou can score the Jakk,
I can show you a way
to beat the rain.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.905
LUCY: Bio-imprint required.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.408
Hey, guys.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.991
By now,
you’re feeling adrift.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.076
Guess what? Me, too.

16:45.922 --> 16:49.915
See, we’ve been through a lot,
but right now,
we ’re a bit stuck.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.050
On the plus side,
we’ve been through a lot.

16:53.596 --> 16:54.881
And we’ll get through
this, too. But first,

16:55.723 --> 16:57.224
you have to answer
the big question.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.053
Are we a team?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.017
I'm going to kill him.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.844
Sorry. Bad choice of words.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.352
So, I’m forcing you to do
the one thing that you hate.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.522
Talk.

17:07.610 --> 17:10.443
Every time you both
answer honestly,
you get to make a move.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.608
Move all the pieces
back into place,
and Lucy starts up again.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.275
D’a vin,
touch the lie detector.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.576
Answer your first question.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.117
What’s your best memory
growing up?

17:22.250 --> 17:23.786
Team building, great.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.866
Come on, D'avin.
What was your best memory?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.796
Let's get this over with.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.796
The time Dad disappeared for
a month and it was quiet.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.136
(CHlMES)

17:38.641 --> 17:41.553
Dutch, how did you greet me
when we first met?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.561
(EXHALES)

17:48.484 --> 17:49.644
lshot him.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.934
(CHlMES)

17:51.571 --> 17:52.902
Booze?
Plenty.

17:52.989 --> 17:53.978
Great.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.949
Medical supplies?
What medical supplies
does she need?

18:03.165 --> 18:04.996
Platelets. Antibiotics.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.331
And where are we
getting all this?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.250
My order has a fully
stocked infirmary.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.165
We do a lot of cutting.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.129
(SCOFFS)

18:17.805 --> 18:19.670
You're going to take off
on my man while he's dying?

18:19.807 --> 18:20.922
He's stable.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.473
But you can't move him
until he's fixed.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.470
It's your call.
See, that's all
well and good.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.606
But it's black raining
out there, bitches.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.026
That's why the gods
invented basements.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.691
Bitches.
(MAN GlGGLES)

18:40.870 --> 18:43.953
The old mine access routes.
They crisscross Old Town.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.206
I know the way.
I grew up down there.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.491
Hey, hey, hey.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.373
Where do they get to go?
No way they're coming back.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.205
We'll be back.
Less than an hour.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.881
You have my word.
Good.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.469
Because ifyou're not,
I pick one person and
I put them out in the rain.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.383
These are your own people.
My people?

19:02.183 --> 19:04.549
My people are rats
leaving a sinking ship.

little farm on Leith.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.190

19:13.027 --> 19:14.892
l have to make my own way
off of this rock.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.486
And I'll cancel anyone
who tries to stop me.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.072
You're going to cut and run.
Come on. This is crap, man!

19:20.159 --> 19:22.491

he likes you enough
to come back.

I pray you know what
you're doing, Killjoy.

regret right now?

Being stupid about D'avin.

(CHlMES)

20:09.500 --> 20:10.865
I usually know better.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.915

20:15.548 --> 20:18.415

greatest fear?

Not knowing what's next.

(BUZZES)

20:31.230 --> 20:33.016

is what's next.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.602
And the warrant after that.

20:36.986 --> 20:40.478
That's what got me through
when lwas first on the run
from Khlyen.

20:41.449 --> 20:44.941

warrant by warrant.
And one day, you've...

(CLICKS TONGUE)

20:46.871 --> 20:48.782

All my life, all I ever
wanted to be was a hero.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.634
Probably because I never
had the bones to stand up
to our shitty dad.

21:08.350 --> 21:12.059
So, I got a uniform and
a weapon and I learned
how to kill bad guys.

Except one day,
I wake up and I find out...

21:19.487 --> 21:21.068
I'm not a hero.

lam the bad guy.

I'll never be good enough.

(CHlMES)

21:44.303 --> 21:45.463
Atta go, team.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.514
You’re almost on your way.

21:47.598 --> 21:48.883
Just one final question.

Dutch, do you trust D’a vin ?

21:57.650 --> 22:00.892

grew up down here.

offends you, Jaqobis?

22:10.621 --> 22:12.031
You give people
false hope.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.862
You don't
respect faith.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.957
Oh, l'd respect you
ifyou actually believed
what you were selling.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.542
But you use religion
to play politics.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.998
You can believe in more than
one thing at once.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.885
I believe in a free
Westerley.
(LAUGHS)

22:28.430 --> 22:29.465
VVeH,goodluck
with that.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.639
Might as well believe
in monsters and
Level 6 Killjoys.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.634
The Company owns
Westerley, Alvis.
And they are not letting go.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.386
ALVlS: Neither are we.
Enjoy your tug of war, then.

22:37.481 --> 22:40.097
But I prefer fixating
on things that can be,
you know,

22:40.192 --> 22:41.898
fixed.
I've noticed.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.647
And who nominated you
to fix them all, Jaqobis?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.352
What's that supposed to mean,
"Who nominated"?

22:48.117 --> 22:50.654
Alvis, what brings you?

22:50.911 --> 22:52.993
Twick, we have a friend
in need of some bliss.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.329
Oh, man. It's tight
out there, Alvis.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.078
Supply just about dried up.
We don't need much,
just one hit.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.295
Is this one of your
pet Killjoys?

23:00.671 --> 23:02.081
A pet?

23:02.172 --> 23:04.379
The meet-up had a hitch.
What meet-up?

23:04.466 --> 23:07.173
He's helping to
set things right.
We need the Jakk.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.799
One hit. For the cause.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.145
Thanks.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.483
It's my last one.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.254
And the roots grew.
And the roots grew.

Please, Uncle,
a blessing?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.547
ALVlS: My pain,
your redemption.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.553
My suffering,
your salvation.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.847
ALL: And the roots grew.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.359
JOHN: Those people back there.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.354
They all Resistance?

24:06.779 --> 24:10.067
ALVlS: One out of
every 10 down here.
Eager for independence.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.488
Looking to die
for a cause.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.069
Like you.
JOHN: Me?

24:13.160 --> 24:15.116
You don't have to
go back to the bar.
You could save yourself.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.741
But here you are.
That's just basic humanity.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.696
ALVlS: Not much place
for that on Westerley.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.953
Makes you either
a masochist or a martyr.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.454
And an odd choice
for a Killjoy.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.754
Honestly, ljust wanted
to build spaceships,
but life had other plans.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.082
Well, D'avin had other plans,
and l accommodated.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.462
Do that a lot, huh?

24:31.720 --> 24:34.587
Lucky for him, you're so good
at cleaning up after everyone.

24:34.682 --> 24:35.717
SERGEANT: Hold!

24:37.434 --> 24:38.935
Where are you heading?
JOHN: The Royale.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.391
SERGEANT: Oh, really?

24:41.105 --> 24:43.767
Looks like we got here
one monk and one...

24:44.024 --> 24:46.060
Reclamation Agent.
Noshw

24:46.485 --> 24:49.977
Well, I got a man upstairs
with an emergency beacon
ringing loud and clear.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.238
You're going to want to
stay down here. An extraction
team is on the way.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.816
JOHN: Wait, ifthey
see uniforms, they'll
start killing hostages.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.947
Not your warrant,
not your problem.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.198
JOHN: I gave my word.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.491
Let me go in there for you.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.994
l have a better shot
at ending this without
any more bloodshed.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.041
He's really good
at fixing things.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.415
SERGEANT: Okay, Killjoy.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.667
You bring us the crew,
the claims and our guy alive.

25:09.925 --> 25:10.960
It's on you now.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.508
Thirty minutes or
we storm the place.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.722
ALVlS: How are you going
to deliver all that?
JOHN: Quickly.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.094
(SlGHS)

25:23.355 --> 25:25.061
What's wrong?
It's dirty.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.023
Well, can you do
the surgery without it?
No.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.185
We don't have a choice.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.490
Make sure I get
through this?

25:45.127 --> 25:46.617
Like I said, I owe you.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.788
(SlGHS HEAVILY)

26:02.770 --> 26:04.055
Let's save this asshole.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.275
(EXHALES)

26:12.237 --> 26:14.068
Yes, I trust D'avin.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.649
(BUZZING)

26:21.246 --> 26:24.409
No, I absolutely do not
trust D'avin.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.910
(BUZZING)
(SlGHS)

26:26.001 --> 26:27.161
It must be broken.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.124
We're never going to get
Lucy started again.

26:35.761 --> 26:36.796
I get it.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.131
lt bothers you.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.884
You can't be completely sure
that someone can't...

26:42.017 --> 26:43.052
Switch me on again.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.930
D'avin, talking about it
doesn't help. I need to...

26:47.231 --> 26:48.311
Feel it.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.057
Okay, then,
let's get you there.

26:52.861 --> 26:53.976
Let's go back.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.358
How did you become
a Killjoy?

26:58.117 --> 26:59.857
After you ran away
from Khlyen.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.538
l, um...

27:05.124 --> 27:07.490
I learned three specialties
from my harem.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.208
Killing,

27:11.880 --> 27:15.668
dancing and marrying
into royalty. And the
last two weren't hiring.

27:16.552 --> 27:17.962
(CHUCKLES)

27:18.971 --> 27:20.381
I bet you were
a great dancer.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.220
It's the one part
I still miss.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.216
Well, come on,
you have a captive
audience of one.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.517
No way. No chance. No.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.223
Come on, Dutch.
Absolutely not.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.391
Feel something.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.349
At least trust me
enough for this.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.726
You first.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.066
lmpress me.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.731
(CHUCKLES)

27:41.243 --> 27:42.358
Okay, um...

27:44.413 --> 27:47.746
The service did teach us
one dance for formal
occasions.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.250
But it requires a partner.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.706
Cheater.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.089
Lucy, ifyou please.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.046
(MUSIC PLAYING)

28:47.976 --> 28:49.386
I can't.
Shit.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.138
Dutch.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.393
You need to stop being
so polite. Yell at me.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.982
It's okay to be angry,
to hate me, it's normal.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.648
Normal won't work here.
That's why I'm angry.

29:01.573 --> 29:06.317
If anyone... If the real you
hurt me or Johnny,
I know exactly what to do.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.071
l'd kill you, I'd mourn you,
and I'd move on.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.453
But this is so much
messier than that.

29:15.837 --> 29:18.169
You're as much a victim
as we are, D'avin.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.959
So, I don't get to hurt you.
I don't get to hate you.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.008
And I don't know
how to move on.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.760
PAWTER: Suction.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.142
Suction.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.858
Avoiding the phrenic nerve.
Careful.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.524
What did I hit?
He's crashing.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.776
No,no,no.
Look, he's fine. He's not.
You're doing great.

29:45.867 --> 29:46.947
l... ldon't...

29:47.536 --> 29:48.696
I'm hearing things.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.120
This was a mistake.
I can't do this.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.492
No, no, no. Hey, hey.
You can do this.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.200
No. Last time I did this,
I killed my patient.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.624
(CHUCKLES) Okay, look,
you're feeling paranoid.

29:59.881 --> 30:03.840
No. Back on Qresh,
l operated high once.
And I killed him.

30:04.553 --> 30:07.044
I should have gone to jail.
I should have lost my license.

30:07.389 --> 30:10.222
But my family
hushed it up and lwas
shipped here instead.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.970
That's why I work out of
the back of a bar, John.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.676
I'm not some do-gooder.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.680
I'm a failure
with rich parents.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.316
And Mommy and Daddy
keep you supplied
in pure Jakk.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.363
Hey. Hey.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.992
lllenore Pawter Simms.
You're going through
a bad high.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.740
But this guy,
he needs you.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.579
And junkie or not,
you are the best doctor
on this shitty moon.

30:38.712 --> 30:39.747
It's a pretty low bar.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.047
It is a pretty low bar.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.419
And I'm down there with you.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.922
Depending on you like
all those people downstairs.

30:48.930 --> 30:49.919
Now, fix him.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.598
What is this?

30:57.689 --> 30:59.395
Lucy, projection.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.060
DUTCH: Lovely.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.767
A giant picture of you.
No, that's not me.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.440
Thats

31:07.616 --> 31:08.696
bad D'avin.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.282
What am I supposed to
do with him?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.577
Hate him. Hurt him.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.446
Move on.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.586
You first.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.878
You can't avoid
knives forever.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.638
Why, they going to stop
making guns?
I'm being serious.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.132
I'm not the only one
you hurt.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.433
You won't even talk about
stabbing John.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.559
Come on, soldier boy.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.953
You just going to stand there,
or are you going to kill
something?

31:57.165 --> 31:59.417
Okay, I get it.
You want me to
face my demons.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.662
So, face them.
Hit the target.
He's right behind me.

32:01.795 --> 32:02.830
Dutch, this isn't funny.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.162
We can't be a team
unless you trust
yourself again.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.168
If there's a warrant on my ass
and you've got the shot,

32:07.300 --> 32:09.256
I need to know
you can take the shot.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.507
lf Khlyen is behind me,
I need to know you can
take the shot.

32:14.683 --> 32:15.798
Take the shot.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.054
Fine.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.145
(EXHALES)

32:36.371 --> 32:37.656
Wait! Don't. Don't.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.371
I'm sorry.
Don't be. It's okay.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.543
I think wejust got
our answer.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.173
You don't trust me.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.046
I'll tell John.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.469
(BEEPING)
LUCY: Warning.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.801
We seem to be caught
in the rain ’3 magnetic flux.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.933
Which means?
We are being pulled
into the event itself.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.264
Calculating
our orbital decay.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.733
Orbital decay?
We're being pulled
into the storm.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.291
It's done.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.244
He's alive.

33:28.632 --> 33:31.044
Finally, some good news.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.462
Can he move?
She's closing him up now.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.928
Says he'll be good to go
when the rain stops.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.422
But he won't be walking.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.424
Then how the hell
are we supposed to
get to our ship?

33:41.603 --> 33:44.265
I'm working on it.
Can I have two minutes
to catch my breath?

33:44.397 --> 33:45.728
I don't care about
your breathing.

33:45.815 --> 33:49.649
So figure out something
or I put this guy down
right now!

33:51.738 --> 33:52.898
What is that?

33:57.285 --> 33:58.491
Who are you talking to?

33:59.663 --> 34:02.370
The Company.
And there's a squad
waiting to end you

34:02.457 --> 34:05.244
ifyou touch a hair on me
or any of these people.

34:05.752 --> 34:09.961
Company don't give a shit
about Westies, but they'll
care about you, won't they?

34:11.258 --> 34:13.294
Open the door!
No,no,no.
You don't want to do this.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.461
Move!

34:15.929 --> 34:17.840
JOHN: Don't do it.
We'll work something out.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.517
(SCREAMING)

34:25.355 --> 34:26.515
SURJA: Crawl, Company dog.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.149
Your people made the rain.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.647
Let's see how you
like it now.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.490
Now, unless you want
somebody else
going out there,

34:39.619 --> 34:41.826
give me a plan on how to
get out of here.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.372
He was the plan, you idiot.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.163
SURJA: Where are you going?
Hey!

34:54.342 --> 34:56.674
HECTOR: Man, get back inside.
What are you, crazy?

34:59.222 --> 35:00.302
JOHN: Little bit.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.176
But I didn't come out
just for you.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.550
I do not trust D'avin.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.473
If he was the last man
in the universe,
I wouldn't trust him.

35:07.564 --> 35:08.724
(BUZZING)

35:08.857 --> 35:11.519
LU CY: Our proximity to
the storm is interfering
with the device.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.357
Its components are finely...
Shut up.

35:13.486 --> 35:16.353
Lucy, you have to
start the engines.
The device won’t let me.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.525
Okay, override it.
lcannot

35:18.658 --> 35:20.444
Storm impact in 30 seconds.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.526
What if itjust stops?

35:23.830 --> 35:25.115
Why the hell not?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.204
Thank you. Engines on/ine.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.713
-l'm on drive.
-l'm on guidance.

35:43.683 --> 35:44.718
Jaqobis!

35:51.232 --> 35:54.065
Like I said,
masochist or martyr.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.564
ljust need to pick
something up.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.371
He'll live. Alvis?

36:08.750 --> 36:10.035
Black rain scars.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.082
The brothers will be jealous.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.585
Okay, we got him.
How do we use him?

36:15.090 --> 36:17.706
Don't know, don't care.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.424
We got movement down here!

36:19.886 --> 36:21.922
The Company.
Get everyone up!

36:22.222 --> 36:24.087
We'll use them as
human shields! Move! Move!

36:25.558 --> 36:27.935
Now, what are you doing?
You need to fix this!

36:30.271 --> 36:31.602
In the last 10 days,

36:32.565 --> 36:34.851
I've been attacked by
face-hugging biotech,

36:34.943 --> 36:38.686
stabbed by my brother,
had major surgery,
helped perform major surgery,

36:38.780 --> 36:40.190
been beaten,
bullied and burned.

36:40.281 --> 36:43.068
lam done fixing things.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.238
You said you had a plan.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.864
Oh, I have a plan.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.288
But you wouldn't like it.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.253
Pree.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.632
You better let The Company
in before they blast
through your floor.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.089
Hold your fire down there!
I'm opening up!

37:22.282 --> 37:24.147
Thanks for patching me up.
Again.

37:25.952 --> 37:29.410
You're coming down
pretty hard. You're going
to get the chills.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.746
You're good at this.

37:33.293 --> 37:34.658
Who was the addict?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.917
You're not the first woman
I've had to score drugs for.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.048
Go home, Johnny.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.800
Doctor's orders.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.094
You're ready.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.031
ALVlS: You still question
my faith?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.494
JOHN: Well,
your sanity, maybe.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.031
Uncle.

38:11.956 --> 38:12.991
Please.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.123
May l have your blessing?

38:19.672 --> 38:22.755
Well, this meet-up was
certainly more eventful
than we planned.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.803
Lot of trouble to go through
to deliver a message.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.589
What do you have for me?

38:27.680 --> 38:30.547
We're stockpiling
weapons and troops
all across Old Town.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.141
We're prepping for
something big.
But they haven't told us what.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.264
But it's coming.

38:41.402 --> 38:45.486
Specs on all the storage
depots. And even better,
blueprints.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.234
For the bunkers.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.784
l'll pray for your
quick recovery.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.047
You were right, John.
We're broken.

39:14.143 --> 39:17.852
But now we know.
And we want to figure out
what's next.

39:20.108 --> 39:23.066
So, until then,
I'm off the ship.

39:26.948 --> 39:27.983
Consolation prize?

39:31.619 --> 39:32.734
Issue 41.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.203
John, I'm sorry I hurt you.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.583
So you bought me a comic?

39:37.917 --> 39:40.203
lt's Captain Apex.
The one I... I lost.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.619
You bought me a comic
to apologize for stabbing me.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.082
No.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.460
No, John, look. I...

39:47.468 --> 39:49.174
I know I've messed up
in so many different ways.

39:49.304 --> 39:52.137
No, you have no idea
where you even began
to mess up.

39:53.766 --> 39:54.801
Okay.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.345
I didn't talk to you
for nine years.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.554
And?

39:57.645 --> 40:00.512
And I left you to deal
with the crap
of Mom and Dad alone.

40:00.607 --> 40:01.642
Yeah.

40:04.277 --> 40:07.644
Okay, thanks for playing,
but you failed to provide
a complete answer.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.069
How about what it cost me?

40:17.165 --> 40:19.406
Taking care of Mom,
I couldn't go away to school.

40:19.500 --> 40:23.118
Taking care of Dad's debts.
I can never, ever go home.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.373
And then what?

40:26.549 --> 40:29.256
You slept with the one person
that | asked you not to.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.797
And what did
that cost me, huh?

40:33.806 --> 40:34.795
Our team...
I get it.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.423
D'av.
l wrecked everything
in your life.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.594
Just tell me how
to make it better.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.472
No, I am done.
lam done cleaning up for you.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.554
You want to fix this?

40:44.859 --> 40:46.065
Then you figure it out.

41:01.584 --> 41:02.619
(BEEPING)

41:03.920 --> 41:04.955
Come in.

41:08.549 --> 41:09.629
Can't sleep.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.224
Long day?

41:22.647 --> 41:23.853
Shit weather.
Hmm.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.231
Don't be mad I couldn't
make it work.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.814
I'm mad that you'd even
think that I'd be mad.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.444
Bedtime story?

41:40.790 --> 41:42.030
Why not?

41:45.920 --> 41:48.502
"After valiantly dispatching
the Admiral's hordes,

41:48.589 --> 41:52.207
"Captain Apex received
a distress call from
the Velubian Princess."

41:52.301 --> 41:55.634
Oh, she's quite Velubian.
| see why you like this.
Shh!

41:55.722 --> 41:57.007
Come on.

41:57.390 --> 41:58.755
(CLEARING THROAT)

41:59.392 --> 42:02.930
"As we return to our heroes,
they are once again trapped
on Laguna 37.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.056
"Suddenly...

42:04.147 --> 42:05.227
"Captain Apex, watch out!

42:05.648 --> 42:07.559
"l'll handle this,
Your Highness.

42:07.650 --> 42:12.519
"Meanwhile, in a galaxy far,
far away, unimaginable evil
was quietly afoot."
