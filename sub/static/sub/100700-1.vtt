WEBVTT

00:43.069 --> 00:44.569
No ranch for sale no more!

00:45.704 --> 00:47.071
Can you believe we actually did
it?

00:47.073 --> 00:47.937
I know!

00:47.939 --> 00:48.873
Thank you girls for believing
in me.

00:50.742 --> 00:53.576
Ah, the air is so fresh
out here, it's so clean.

00:53.578 --> 00:54.646
There's so much of it.

00:55.714 --> 00:56.713
That's for sure.

00:56.715 --> 00:57.547
We're gonna be happy here.

00:57.549 --> 00:58.550
I know we will.

00:59.551 --> 01:00.783
Oh, hey!

01:00.785 --> 01:03.586
Let's take a picture.

01:03.588 --> 01:04.188
- All right.
- Okay.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.855
- Okay.
- Get the sign.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.324
- Get the sign.
- Yeah.

01:07.326 --> 01:09.559
- All right.
- Get the house, okay.

01:09.561 --> 01:12.064
One, two, three.

01:14.266 --> 01:15.765
Okay, let's do a goofy one.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.334
- All right.
- Okay, okay.

01:17.336 --> 01:18.302
Ready, timer.

01:18.304 --> 01:20.603
That's one
of my fondest memories.

01:20.605 --> 01:22.674
One of the happiest days of my
life.

01:24.176 --> 01:26.276
I couldn't believe it when
my parents sat me down

01:26.278 --> 01:28.112
and told me that they bought
this ranch

01:28.114 --> 01:30.580
and that we're moving to the
countryside,

01:30.582 --> 01:32.582
but I quickly fell in love with
it here

01:32.584 --> 01:35.720
and I can't see myself
living anywhere else.

01:45.264 --> 01:48.765
But then my dad deployed
and was killed in battle

01:48.767 --> 01:49.732
fighting for our country.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.701
I'm Chaplain Gonzales.

01:51.703 --> 01:53.903
We are here to regretfully
inform you that your.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.739
That day, our whole
world turned upside down.

02:06.152 --> 02:08.553
And everything quickly
went downhill after that.

02:36.415 --> 02:39.951
Pastor Williams always
preached hope and faith.

02:41.019 --> 02:43.953
My mom went to his church every
Sunday.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.623
She still had her hope.

02:46.858 --> 02:50.262
But when my dad died, I lost my
faith.

02:57.869 --> 03:00.004
Morning girl, did you miss me?

03:03.808 --> 03:07.011
I'd be so lost without
you.

03:13.017 --> 03:17.021
I think that means you'd
be lost without me too.

03:20.959 --> 03:23.362
You really like taking
care of her, don't you?

03:25.697 --> 03:28.032
I love it, I love her.

03:30.402 --> 03:34.404
Well, one day this will
all be yours to take care of.

03:34.406 --> 03:36.373
That's one of the reasons we
bought it

03:36.375 --> 03:38.042
was so we could pass it on to
you.

03:38.943 --> 03:41.646
I wish he was still here
to teach me what to do.

03:43.915 --> 03:45.884
I know, me too.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.688
But just remember, he believed
in you.

03:51.756 --> 03:52.558
And I do too.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.760
When the day comes, you'll know
exactly

03:57.762 --> 03:59.165
how to take care of it.

04:00.064 --> 04:01.065
I just know it.

04:08.274 --> 04:10.907
I remember when your dad
taught you how to ride her.

04:10.909 --> 04:12.342
I remember too.

04:12.344 --> 04:14.043
I was so afraid that first time

04:14.045 --> 04:15.445
I thought I was gonna hurt her.

04:15.447 --> 04:16.280
You weren't going to.

04:16.282 --> 04:17.949
Well, I know that now.

04:19.918 --> 04:21.920
She was the last thing Dad ever
gave me.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.161
Go on, I know you want to.

04:32.163 --> 04:33.062
I'll see you inside for lunch.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.065
Okay, good.

05:17.175 --> 05:20.843
You can open your eyes
now.

05:20.845 --> 05:21.846
Do you like her?

05:24.849 --> 05:27.353
She's breathtaking!

05:29.821 --> 05:30.755
Well go on, go on.

05:38.896 --> 05:40.530
Hey, here try this.

05:40.532 --> 05:42.499
Put your hand like this.

05:42.501 --> 05:44.334
What are we doing?

05:44.336 --> 05:46.838
What we're doing is called
a horseman's handshake.

05:47.872 --> 05:52.074
It is a very respectful
way to treat an animal

05:52.076 --> 05:54.879
and it's also a very polite
way to say good morning.

05:55.913 --> 05:56.946
Go ahead, try it.

05:56.948 --> 05:57.947
Good morning.

05:57.949 --> 06:00.317
See if she'll give you
permission to pet her.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.320
Hi there.

06:04.222 --> 06:06.623
Wow, looks like somebody's
got a new best friend.

06:21.939 --> 06:22.572
Hey.

06:22.574 --> 06:23.573
Hey Chris.

06:23.575 --> 06:25.975
You don't ever hear
your phone ring, do you?

06:25.977 --> 06:28.046
No, I've been riding.

06:29.113 --> 06:31.047
My sister's only a
few years older than us

06:31.049 --> 06:33.082
and she's never off of that
thing.

06:33.084 --> 06:34.984
I mean, she has to check it
every minute.

06:34.986 --> 06:36.218
My dad's always yelling at her.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.388
Yeah, I'd rather have
my hands on her reins

06:38.390 --> 06:39.391
than on my phone.

06:40.326 --> 06:43.893
So, I just thought I'd come
visit you.

06:43.895 --> 06:44.927
Just because we're not in school

06:44.929 --> 06:47.163
doesn't mean we can't hang out.

06:47.165 --> 06:50.066
Did you just come from
practice?

06:50.068 --> 06:52.968
Yeah, someone forgot to tell
Coach Davis

06:52.970 --> 06:53.971
that we're on break.

06:55.641 --> 06:57.374
I guess that's what
happens when you decide

06:57.376 --> 06:58.976
to play football for the school.

07:00.244 --> 07:02.446
I still need the improvement
though,

07:02.448 --> 07:03.979
at least that's how I feel.

07:03.981 --> 07:05.247
What, come on.

07:05.249 --> 07:07.451
No way, I've seen you play.

07:07.453 --> 07:09.020
I think you're really good.

07:10.021 --> 07:12.290
I bet you'll be the star
running back in no time.

07:13.459 --> 07:15.592
- Hey!
- Hi.

07:15.594 --> 07:16.493
You need help?

07:16.495 --> 07:17.496
Sure.

07:21.099 --> 07:22.098
How's Chris?

07:22.100 --> 07:24.967
He's fine, he's coming
around again tomorrow.

07:24.969 --> 07:25.635
Really?

07:25.637 --> 07:26.638
What?

07:27.439 --> 07:29.004
He's cute.

07:29.006 --> 07:30.007
Mom!

07:32.310 --> 07:33.309
I'm right, aren't I?

07:33.311 --> 07:35.177
Stop!

07:35.179 --> 07:36.178
Do you like him?

07:36.180 --> 07:38.280
We are not talking about this.

07:38.282 --> 07:39.449
Why not?

07:39.451 --> 07:42.486
Seriously, sometimes it's
more like we're roommates.

07:42.488 --> 07:44.989
Well, so that you think.

07:47.593 --> 07:51.362
Actually, there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.032
Pastor Williams is gonna
come over for lunch today.

07:57.135 --> 07:59.135
He's only gonna talk about
church again.

07:59.137 --> 08:01.471
You haven't been since
your father passed.

08:01.473 --> 08:03.341
I don't want to go anymore.

08:06.177 --> 08:06.978
Why not?

08:07.713 --> 08:10.214
Mom, please don't pressure me.

08:11.517 --> 08:12.518
All right.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.120
But you can't avoid it forever.

08:34.540 --> 08:35.739
It looks beautiful, honey.

08:35.741 --> 08:37.239
Yes, I love all the colors,

08:37.241 --> 08:38.675
and how they shine in light.

08:38.677 --> 08:39.678
Right.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.513
So what do you think, honey?

08:43.515 --> 08:44.516
I think it's perfect.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.318
It's just perfect, that looks
great, Mike.

08:48.186 --> 08:50.119
You think God would approve?

08:50.121 --> 08:52.188
Well, Mike, God doesn't
micromanage.

08:52.190 --> 08:55.525
He leaves that up to me.

08:55.527 --> 08:56.726
No, it looks great.

08:56.728 --> 08:58.427
Look, I just wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

08:58.429 --> 08:59.428
Oh.

08:59.430 --> 09:00.530
No really, you're the
one that convinced me

09:00.532 --> 09:03.065
to move out here, you found
this historical building

09:03.067 --> 09:04.501
and you restored it
with your own two hands.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.202
Man, that's big time.

09:06.204 --> 09:08.170
Now, I know we've been
friends for a long time, Mike,

09:08.172 --> 09:10.105
but you went above and beyond,
man.

09:10.107 --> 09:11.608
You would have done exactly
the same thing for me.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.375
- You know I would.
- Yeah.

09:13.377 --> 09:16.245
- You know I would.
- Come here you.

09:16.247 --> 09:18.447
Well now we just need a
congregation.

09:18.449 --> 09:19.148
You know what they say,

09:19.150 --> 09:21.217
if you build it they will come.

09:21.219 --> 09:22.384
Let's hope, let's
hope.

09:22.386 --> 09:25.187
And if you paint it, they
will most assuredly come.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.422
Absolutely.

09:26.424 --> 09:27.425
Now you see.

09:28.326 --> 09:31.460
Way up there where it comes
together.

09:31.462 --> 09:32.529
For the paint?

09:32.531 --> 09:36.535
No no no, bright lights,
I can't get up there.

09:51.148 --> 09:53.084
Why are you avoiding Pastor
Williams?

09:56.187 --> 09:59.288
Because every time I see him

09:59.290 --> 10:01.158
I can only picture Dad's
funeral.

10:03.327 --> 10:04.328
Oh Grace.

10:05.531 --> 10:08.163
I just don't believe any more,
Mom.

10:08.165 --> 10:09.300
Don't say that.

10:10.501 --> 10:12.234
What's the point in prayer

10:12.236 --> 10:14.336
if I don't believe in the words?

10:27.184 --> 10:30.354
You know, your dad is still
with us.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.227
He's always going to be here.

10:41.165 --> 10:42.566
I still feel like I'm waiting
for him

10:42.568 --> 10:43.735
to walk through my door.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.472
Like any second it's gonna
happen.

10:51.643 --> 10:52.778
But it just never does.

11:02.486 --> 11:03.487
I know.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.297
And that's why we have to
stay strong for each other,

11:15.199 --> 11:17.234
so that we can get through this
together.

11:30.281 --> 11:32.214
Rebecca, how you doing?

11:32.216 --> 11:33.217
How's Grace?

11:36.487 --> 11:38.420
She's, she's okay.

11:38.422 --> 11:40.857
- Yeah?
- Considering everything.

11:40.859 --> 11:42.759
You know I think about you
guys a lot.

11:42.761 --> 11:45.196
Haven't seen her since the
funeral.

11:46.364 --> 11:49.333
I feel like after everything
your family has done for me,

11:50.936 --> 11:52.136
I owe you guys.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.274
I mean, the fact is,
without his hard work,

11:58.576 --> 12:00.644
this town wouldn't even have a
church.

12:00.646 --> 12:02.313
I wouldn't have this house.

12:04.916 --> 12:09.921
But the truth is, we're about to
lose it.

12:10.889 --> 12:12.454
What?

12:12.456 --> 12:14.289
Well, you know how I
sold all the cattle off?

12:14.291 --> 12:16.425
Yeah.

12:16.427 --> 12:18.262
Mike had become a really good
rancher.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.765
I tried my hardest to do all of
that stuff

12:21.767 --> 12:24.299
and I just couldn't keep up with
that

12:24.301 --> 12:26.468
and with taking care of
my daughter all on my own.

12:26.470 --> 12:28.303
You shouldn't have to.

12:28.305 --> 12:29.875
That's too much for any one
person.

12:30.742 --> 12:32.441
And Grace doesn't even know.

13:47.551 --> 13:49.819
So how was my husband when
you two served together?

13:49.821 --> 13:51.520
Who, Mike?

13:51.522 --> 13:52.556
It was funny.

13:53.825 --> 13:54.690
Marginally.

13:54.692 --> 13:56.425
Yeah, Mike was great.

13:56.427 --> 13:57.292
Well, wait a minute.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.494
I don't wanna blow his big old
head up

13:58.496 --> 14:00.596
any bigger than it already is.

14:00.598 --> 14:02.397
No Mike, Mike was awesome.

14:02.399 --> 14:04.868
Mike was awesome, he was a great
sergeant.

14:04.870 --> 14:05.871
Guys loved him.

14:06.905 --> 14:08.370
They'd run through a wall for
him,

14:08.372 --> 14:09.538
take a bullet for the guy.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.573
I think we all would.

14:11.575 --> 14:12.842
That is not how you
used to talk about me

14:12.844 --> 14:15.444
when I was giving you orders, my
friend.

14:15.446 --> 14:16.846
No, no, not at all.

14:16.848 --> 14:18.447
You weren't talking about me
like that

14:18.449 --> 14:20.549
when I was telling you
to do 20 more pushups.

14:20.551 --> 14:21.550
And I was there.

14:21.552 --> 14:23.519
It almost made me quit.

14:23.521 --> 14:25.420
Is that what made you
ditch a rifle for a Bible?

14:25.422 --> 14:28.390
No, I was long gone when I
started

14:28.392 --> 14:29.926
to really work on my faith.

14:29.928 --> 14:30.929
I had left the Army.

14:32.563 --> 14:33.564
Then I came back.

14:34.598 --> 14:38.036
Just not as a soldier this
time, but as a pastor.

14:39.603 --> 14:42.540
And he served his country
proud, in both ways.

14:44.575 --> 14:45.607
Thanks, sweetie.

14:45.609 --> 14:46.943
You always had a knack.

14:46.945 --> 14:49.112
My men revered you, they
would open up to you,

14:49.114 --> 14:50.779
tell you their dreams, their
hopes,

14:50.781 --> 14:52.081
they'd confess everything to
you.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.449
Not to me, just you, naturally.

14:54.451 --> 14:56.720
Nah, they was just
sacred of the Lord, man.

14:57.956 --> 14:59.825
It was like confession a lot of
times.

15:03.394 --> 15:04.395
That being said,

15:06.463 --> 15:08.332
anything you wanna confess,
Mike?

15:09.600 --> 15:10.869
Now's a good a time as any.

15:11.735 --> 15:13.504
Well, now that you mention it,

15:17.508 --> 15:20.509
I've been called and asked

15:20.511 --> 15:23.612
to go back and do another tour
of duty.

15:23.614 --> 15:24.415
Really?

15:25.516 --> 15:26.517
Really.

15:27.484 --> 15:28.586
You okay with that?

15:30.856 --> 15:32.958
Well, I can't tell him not to
go, but...

15:36.594 --> 15:37.996
You're afraid, it's okay.

15:40.198 --> 15:43.565
I mean, if I were in your
position I'd be afraid too.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.168
You know that I don't
wanna leave you and Grace

15:45.170 --> 15:48.604
for 10 minutes, let
alone months at a time,

15:48.606 --> 15:53.377
but I just don't, I don't
see any way I could say no.

15:54.778 --> 15:56.112
I don't like my men, they need
me.

15:56.114 --> 16:00.582
My country needs me.

16:23.841 --> 16:25.509
Hey Grace.

16:35.519 --> 16:36.718
That wasn't funny.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.686
You're right, you're
right, you're right,

16:37.688 --> 16:39.255
it wasn't funny.

16:39.257 --> 16:41.623
It was hysterical.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.825
Best part was you scream
like a little girl.

16:43.827 --> 16:45.161
Did not!

16:45.163 --> 16:46.164
You totally did.

16:47.698 --> 16:49.232
How's Faith doing?

16:49.234 --> 16:50.434
She's great.

16:51.702 --> 16:53.069
Well, I'm sure that's just
because

16:53.071 --> 16:55.206
she gets to spend all
of her time with you.

16:57.608 --> 16:59.641
I still have some
work that I need to do,

16:59.643 --> 17:01.843
but do you wanna help me?

17:01.845 --> 17:03.212
I'd love to.

17:03.214 --> 17:05.216
Great, I think you'll really
enjoy it.

17:14.059 --> 17:17.961
How'd I let you to
convince me to do this again?

17:17.963 --> 17:19.895
Well usually I'd get my mom to
help me,

17:19.897 --> 17:22.968
but you said you wanted to
spend more time with me, so.

17:25.036 --> 17:27.869
Yeah, this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

17:38.749 --> 17:40.649
So why'd you name her Faith?

17:40.651 --> 17:42.720
I didn't, my Dad named her.

17:45.156 --> 17:46.157
I like it.

17:47.791 --> 17:50.625
Yeah, it's okay I guess.

17:50.627 --> 17:51.762
Why just okay?

17:52.796 --> 17:54.730
'Cause to be honest, I just
don't know

17:54.732 --> 17:56.932
if I have it anymore.

17:56.934 --> 17:58.103
What, faith?

18:00.238 --> 18:02.771
Hey, don't say that, okay.

18:02.773 --> 18:04.675
You're gonna get through
these tough times.

18:34.004 --> 18:36.838
Mrs. Evans, this is
Ben Clark from the bank again.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.874
We urgently need to talk.

18:38.876 --> 18:42.211
As you are aware from
your foreclosure notice.

19:40.438 --> 19:42.070
Rebecca, how you doing?

19:42.072 --> 19:43.905
Hi, am I bothering
you?

19:43.907 --> 19:45.040
Oh no, it's no bother at all.

19:45.042 --> 19:46.375
Sandra's off running errands

19:46.377 --> 19:48.910
and I'm just up here working on
a sermon.

19:48.912 --> 19:51.147
I sure could use a sneak peak
right now.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.316
Oh no, you know I can't do
that.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.818
That'd just ruin the surprise.

19:57.188 --> 19:58.287
You know what, come on up here.

19:58.289 --> 20:00.924
Let's have a chat.

20:13.770 --> 20:14.805
Tell me what's wrong.

20:17.975 --> 20:20.476
The bank's about to foreclose
on us.

20:20.478 --> 20:22.245
Okay but you can't give up.

20:22.247 --> 20:24.149
I don't know if I have the
strength.

20:25.883 --> 20:27.285
You're being tested right now.

20:28.819 --> 20:30.654
But it's gonna make you
stronger.

20:32.122 --> 20:35.491
You're gonna get through,
trust me when I tell you this,

20:35.493 --> 20:37.959
you're gonna come out stronger.

20:37.961 --> 20:39.129
You're gonna get through it.

20:42.467 --> 20:44.169
But you gotta believe that.

20:49.973 --> 20:51.276
Have you prayed about it?

20:54.245 --> 20:56.111
Yes, yes I've prayed, but I
just,

20:56.113 --> 20:57.346
I feel like god's not even...

20:57.348 --> 20:59.848
Rebecca, he's listening to
you.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.319
I know you don't think he is,

21:03.020 --> 21:04.322
but he's listening to you.

21:06.023 --> 21:08.193
The thing is, are you listening
to him?

21:09.194 --> 21:12.761
'Cause he hopes you are so
you'll be able to respond

21:12.763 --> 21:13.764
when he answers.

21:15.533 --> 21:18.035
Remember the two virtues
that I preach on a lot.

21:19.437 --> 21:20.670
Hope and faith.

21:20.672 --> 21:24.473
See when people get in tough
times, like you are right now,

21:24.475 --> 21:27.108
that seems impossible and you
wanna quit,

21:27.110 --> 21:28.977
when it's not easy, when it's
rough,

21:28.979 --> 21:30.281
that's when you need it the
most.

21:31.549 --> 21:32.816
Not the time to quit.

21:33.984 --> 21:34.952
It's time to fight.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.054
Through hope and faith you can
do that

21:39.056 --> 21:40.023
and you're gonna do it.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.229
You need to fight for your hope,

21:45.195 --> 21:47.330
I believe you wanna fight for
your hope

21:47.332 --> 21:51.269
and not just for yourself, but
for Grace.

21:55.038 --> 21:55.939
Y'all both gotta fight.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.976
'Cause let me tell you right
now,

22:00.143 --> 22:04.848
Rebecca, if you're not willing
to fight,

22:08.885 --> 22:10.151
no one else will.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.916
I can see why your
parents wanted to move here.

22:41.918 --> 22:44.121
I know, I love it here.

22:45.922 --> 22:46.890
What about your place?

22:48.359 --> 22:51.460
Um, I grew up on my farm,

22:51.462 --> 22:53.096
it's all I've ever known really.

22:54.264 --> 22:56.998
Do you wanna be a
farmer?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.133
Yeah.

22:58.135 --> 22:58.935
Yeah, I guess I do.

23:00.305 --> 23:02.239
Once my dad retires it'll all be
mine.

23:03.974 --> 23:04.908
What about football?

23:07.277 --> 23:07.976
I don't know, everyone's
always telling me

23:07.978 --> 23:09.978
how good I am at it, but I mean,

23:09.980 --> 23:12.182
I guess the farm has to come
first.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.919
Maybe you can do both.

23:18.121 --> 23:18.989
Yeah, I'd like that.

23:21.124 --> 23:23.326
My mom wants me to
run this place one day.

23:23.328 --> 23:25.026
And I don't mind the hard work,

23:25.028 --> 23:27.332
but I don't know if I can do it
alone.

23:29.099 --> 23:32.135
The only thing I'm afraid
of is letting my dad down.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.871
I think you'll do just fine.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.041
Will you help me?

23:39.109 --> 23:40.975
Do you want me to?

23:40.977 --> 23:42.045
What do you think?

23:51.522 --> 23:52.523
Hi.

23:53.990 --> 23:54.989
How are your parents?

23:54.991 --> 23:56.024
They're good.

23:56.026 --> 23:57.926
Grace keeping you busy,
putting you to work?

23:57.928 --> 24:00.195
Yeah, she is but I'm having
fun.

24:00.197 --> 24:02.565
That's good, are you hungry?

24:02.567 --> 24:03.466
A little.

24:03.468 --> 24:05.066
Okay, well I just made an
apple pie

24:05.068 --> 24:06.968
if you wanna go in and grab a
slice.

24:06.970 --> 24:07.902
Awesome.

24:07.904 --> 24:08.671
All right, we'll see you
inside, okay?

24:08.673 --> 24:10.340
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:14.111 --> 24:14.943
Hey sweetie.

24:14.945 --> 24:15.946
Hi.

24:18.181 --> 24:21.049
Can I talk to you for a
second?

24:21.051 --> 24:23.320
Yeah, is it about that sign I
saw?

24:24.389 --> 24:25.390
Yeah.

24:27.725 --> 24:31.259
So we're gonna have an
estate sale on Saturday.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.093
Okay.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.028
So anything that you don't
need,

24:34.030 --> 24:37.232
I'd like for you to go
ahead and box it up today

24:37.234 --> 24:39.200
and I'll be doing the same
thing.

24:39.202 --> 24:41.238
I don't get it to, why is it
so urgent?

24:50.581 --> 24:51.649
We're broke, Grace.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.085
What?

24:56.153 --> 24:58.353
The ranch is in a lot of debt

24:58.355 --> 25:03.057
and if we don't come up
with some money soon.

25:03.059 --> 25:04.027
Are you serious?

25:06.062 --> 25:11.067
Well, we haven't had
any income coming in

25:11.769 --> 25:14.369
and we've still had to make
all the mortgage payments,

25:14.371 --> 25:17.372
pay all the expenses, cover
the cost of the cattle and...

25:17.374 --> 25:19.708
But we already sold off all
the cattle.

25:19.710 --> 25:22.212
Yeah, but I had to sell
them under market value.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.450
It stopped the bleeding for a
bit, but.

25:31.622 --> 25:33.190
You like it here, don't you?

25:36.293 --> 25:39.093
Do you remember what it was
like before we came here?

25:39.095 --> 25:40.096
Yeah.

25:41.499 --> 25:45.099
Yeah, a two bedroom
apartment in the city.

25:45.101 --> 25:47.170
Your dad and I working all the
time.

25:49.507 --> 25:53.776
Didn't leave much time for us as
a family.

25:53.778 --> 25:54.812
I remember, Mom.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.748
Things got a lot better
for us when we got here.

25:59.750 --> 26:00.751
I know.

26:02.219 --> 26:03.420
I love it here, Grace.

26:04.421 --> 26:05.422
I do too.

26:08.826 --> 26:10.327
That's why I need your help,

26:12.429 --> 26:14.164
so that we don't lose it, okay.

26:15.131 --> 26:16.132
Okay.

26:19.302 --> 26:20.368
Hey.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.605
You don't need to go home
any time soon, do you?

26:22.607 --> 26:23.539
No, why?

26:23.541 --> 26:24.542
I need your help.

26:25.510 --> 26:26.609
Okay, I'm all yours.

26:26.611 --> 26:28.076
Great, follow me.

26:28.078 --> 26:29.179
Okay, coming.

27:06.316 --> 27:08.383
You sure have a lot of books.

27:08.385 --> 27:09.517
Yeah, I love to read.

27:09.519 --> 27:10.520
What about you?

27:13.223 --> 27:15.256
If it's a good enough book
someone's gonna make a movie

27:15.258 --> 27:18.359
about it, so why bother to read
it?

27:18.361 --> 27:20.194
'Cause it's fun to.

27:20.196 --> 27:21.197
I don't know.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.203
So you really have to
get rid of everything?

27:28.305 --> 27:30.171
Yeah, I guess most of this
stuff

27:30.173 --> 27:32.340
is from when I was a kid anyway.

27:32.342 --> 27:33.909
What about you, I'm sure your
room is full

27:33.911 --> 27:35.545
of stuff you don't need anymore.

27:36.914 --> 27:37.980
Not really, actually.

27:37.982 --> 27:40.248
I mean, I grew up on a
farm so my parent's ideas

27:40.250 --> 27:43.619
of gifts were stuff that
the farm also needed.

27:43.621 --> 27:44.720
Like what?

27:44.722 --> 27:45.756
Tools, mostly.

27:47.524 --> 27:50.425
Although, one year I did get a
tractor.

27:50.427 --> 27:51.760
That's pretty cool.

27:51.762 --> 27:53.561
Yeah, I thought it was
the coolest gift ever too,

27:53.563 --> 27:56.932
until my dad said I couldn't
ride it until I was 15.

27:56.934 --> 27:59.434
Well, at least it's
something you can use now

27:59.436 --> 28:00.470
and for years to come.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.742
Like you said, you're gonna
stay on the farm, right?

28:06.176 --> 28:09.812
Yeah, yeah I'm definitely a
country kid.

28:09.814 --> 28:12.413
Wouldn't know what to do
with myself in the city.

28:12.415 --> 28:14.315
Did you know I'm from the
city?

28:14.317 --> 28:16.752
Yeah, I did.

28:16.754 --> 28:18.388
Do you ever wanna go back
there?

28:19.657 --> 28:22.325
No, no I love it here way too
much.

28:23.193 --> 28:25.630
Good, I'm really glad you said
that.

28:26.596 --> 28:28.797
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

28:28.799 --> 28:31.601
Besides, I wouldn't be able
to take Faith into the city.

28:33.470 --> 28:37.438
You know, if Faith was my
horse,

28:37.440 --> 28:38.608
I wouldn't leave her either.

28:46.684 --> 28:48.316
Hopefully a bunch of people
see this

28:48.318 --> 28:50.318
and we'll take these,
hit the neighborhoods.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.487
Y'all just come on in,
everybody come on and grab one

28:52.489 --> 28:54.522
and I'll give everybody one of
these,

28:54.524 --> 28:55.490
we'll get it done, all right.

28:55.492 --> 28:57.225
Let's just kind of just
spread out all over

28:57.227 --> 28:58.761
and let's just floor the
neighborhood.

28:58.763 --> 29:00.829
Some of you go that way,
some of you come with me.

29:00.831 --> 29:03.666
And big smiles, big smiles,
let's go, all right.

29:03.668 --> 29:05.301
- Let's get it done.
- All right.

29:07.972 --> 29:09.370
How is it?

29:09.372 --> 29:11.374
Um, can I talk to you?

29:13.309 --> 29:14.310
What now?

29:15.311 --> 29:17.647
Just come downstairs
with me for a sec, okay.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.831
What are you doing?

29:35.398 --> 29:36.397
I wanted to see if there was
anything

29:36.399 --> 29:37.733
you wanted to keep before...

29:37.735 --> 29:38.734
Mom!

29:38.736 --> 29:40.035
Look, you know we have
to get rid of everything

29:40.037 --> 29:41.036
that we don't need.

29:41.038 --> 29:42.838
But this is Dad's stuff.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.406
And I realize that this
isn't gonna be easy for you.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.377
No, it's not, why should it
be?

29:51.648 --> 29:54.919
I'm only doing this because
I have no other choice here.

29:56.686 --> 29:58.521
Not Dad's stuff, please.

30:01.058 --> 30:02.258
I'm sorry.

30:03.326 --> 30:04.494
But we have to.

30:06.864 --> 30:08.431
I can't believe this.

30:12.970 --> 30:15.405
Did you know that when
I first met your father

30:17.574 --> 30:19.507
he had nothing?

30:19.509 --> 30:21.810
I had just come back from
college to see my mom

30:21.812 --> 30:26.817
and there he was, outside
the train station.

30:30.020 --> 30:31.419
I had to wait for my ride to
turn up

30:31.421 --> 30:33.758
and so I just sat there watching
this guy.

30:34.859 --> 30:38.328
Just tell bad jokes and

30:41.531 --> 30:44.400
doing his best to raise
money for a good cause.

30:50.775 --> 30:51.974
He was a little older than me,

30:51.976 --> 30:56.312
he had scruff on his
face and his sweatshirt

30:58.615 --> 30:59.415
and ripped jeans.

31:02.652 --> 31:03.520
But he was adorable.

31:05.923 --> 31:08.424
But just in need of a
woman's touch, you know?

31:10.961 --> 31:11.962
He smiled at me

31:14.731 --> 31:15.732
and I smiled back.

31:18.468 --> 31:20.670
And then we started
talking it was just like

31:22.539 --> 31:24.772
we had known each other forever,

31:24.774 --> 31:26.676
even though we had literally
just met.

31:30.613 --> 31:32.382
And that was the moment we knew.

31:48.565 --> 31:52.535
Your dad gave this to me
on our first anniversary.

31:54.004 --> 31:55.272
Together forever.

31:59.143 --> 32:03.413
This is what's important to
keep, okay.

32:08.152 --> 32:10.587
That way all you have to do

32:13.057 --> 32:16.526
is look down to remember how
much we both loved each other

32:17.594 --> 32:18.996
and how much we love you.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.670
You know your dad would
have wanted us to do

32:29.672 --> 32:31.505
whatever it takes to keep this
ranch.

32:31.507 --> 32:32.508
I know.

32:33.710 --> 32:35.576
That's why we have to sell
things now

32:35.578 --> 32:36.912
before we're forced to sell
things

32:36.914 --> 32:39.049
that we don't wanna sell.

32:41.484 --> 32:42.485
What do you mean?

32:43.453 --> 32:47.523
It's the last thing
that I would want to do.

32:48.725 --> 32:52.963
No, no you don't mean Faith.

32:54.899 --> 32:56.932
I hope it never has to come to
that.

32:56.934 --> 32:59.600
It'll never come to that!

32:59.602 --> 33:00.536
Do you hear me, never!

33:10.580 --> 33:11.514
Hey, what's wrong?

33:12.749 --> 33:13.382
Is everything okay?

33:13.384 --> 33:15.019
Just come with me, okay?

33:17.820 --> 33:19.787
This is Ben Clark again,

33:19.789 --> 33:23.058
I can't stress enough how
urgent it is that we speak.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.826
As you are aware from
your foreclosure notice,

33:25.828 --> 33:28.696
you don't have much time until
the bank

33:28.698 --> 33:30.531
takes possession of your
property.

33:30.533 --> 33:32.800
So please call me back.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.538
You have both my office
and cell phone numbers.

33:40.244 --> 33:42.612
I feel like we say
goodbye a million times.

33:43.913 --> 33:44.914
Right.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.750
She's having a really
hard time with this.

33:49.752 --> 33:50.851
Yeah, I know.

33:50.853 --> 33:53.623
She'll be okay, our big girl.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.962
I wanna make you both proud of
me.

33:59.529 --> 34:00.830
I know you will.

34:07.837 --> 34:08.638
Hey, oh!

34:11.708 --> 34:14.044
Oh, you two, you two are
something else.

34:15.678 --> 34:19.814
While I'm gone, I know it's
not always going to be easy,

34:19.816 --> 34:22.987
but I know that you can handle
it.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.823
All I want you to do is do your
best,

34:28.825 --> 34:33.061
that's all anybody can ask.

34:33.063 --> 34:34.764
Dad, I'm gonna miss you so
much.

34:37.700 --> 34:41.138
I already miss you two more
than you can possibly imagine.

34:45.309 --> 34:50.513
But when you close your
eyes, I'll be there.

34:59.789 --> 35:02.823
I'm never gonna let you go.

35:02.825 --> 35:04.761
No one will ever take you from
me.

35:09.366 --> 35:11.235
I don't know what I'd do without
you.

35:14.771 --> 35:16.771
So what's it like to ride her?

35:16.773 --> 35:18.808
You've never ridden a horse
before?

35:19.776 --> 35:23.213
When I ride her I feel free.

35:24.081 --> 35:26.216
I just feel so happy and alive.

35:31.888 --> 35:33.257
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

35:42.899 --> 35:44.934
You two look great together.

35:46.070 --> 35:49.772
I mean, she's such a pretty
horse and...

35:51.308 --> 35:52.309
And?

35:54.344 --> 35:55.945
And you're such a pretty girl.

35:58.848 --> 36:01.416
I mean, there's a reason I
avoided even making eye contact

36:01.418 --> 36:03.684
with you the first few years of
school.

36:03.686 --> 36:04.687
What's that?

36:06.923 --> 36:08.756
I don't know, I can't explain
it.

36:08.758 --> 36:12.927
It's like I felt sick just
looking at you.

36:12.929 --> 36:14.229
Gee, thanks.

36:14.231 --> 36:16.899
No, I don't mean it
like that, it's just,

36:18.768 --> 36:21.871
you know, you were the
prettiest girl in school.

36:22.839 --> 36:23.840
I was scared.

36:25.708 --> 36:28.778
I was afraid that if I
tried to talk to you,

36:30.880 --> 36:31.914
you'd just walk away.

36:33.383 --> 36:34.882
I mean, if you did that I
wouldn't be able

36:34.884 --> 36:36.018
to stay at school anymore.

36:37.187 --> 36:38.386
Well it's good thing I spoke
to you

36:38.388 --> 36:41.624
that day you finally approached
me at the water fountain.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.327
You remember that?

36:47.997 --> 36:49.866
So you've really never ridden
a horse?

36:51.435 --> 36:52.768
Actually, I have not, no.

36:53.870 --> 36:56.038
Everyone says riding is so much
fun, but.

36:57.874 --> 36:59.874
Well, how about I teach you?

36:59.876 --> 37:02.344
I don't know, it took me long
enough

37:02.346 --> 37:04.146
to learn how to ride my bike.

37:04.148 --> 37:05.746
Come on, trust me.

37:05.748 --> 37:07.750
Let me help you out with
something too.

37:09.785 --> 37:12.922
Squeezing is like a gas
pedal, it means go fast.

37:13.856 --> 37:17.057
So the harder you squeeze,
not with your here,

37:17.059 --> 37:19.896
but with your heels, the
faster the horse will go.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.298
So a lot of times you'll be
thinking,

37:23.300 --> 37:24.899
I wanna slow down, I wanna slow
down,

37:24.901 --> 37:27.001
but you're telling the horse
yah.

37:27.003 --> 37:28.903
So here watch, we just go, I
know, right.

37:28.905 --> 37:30.174
So there's a lot to know.

37:31.175 --> 37:32.842
But it's all very easy, see.

37:35.878 --> 37:36.979
Very easy.

37:42.419 --> 37:47.021
So what you practice are
figure eights, right.

37:47.023 --> 37:50.392
Here's a figure eight, now
look how little I have to do.

37:50.394 --> 37:52.296
Not scary, right?

37:54.931 --> 37:56.366
You look like you're scared.

37:57.800 --> 37:58.933
Touch her again.

37:58.935 --> 38:02.803
You have to believe in your
horse.

38:02.805 --> 38:04.241
You have to believe in yourself,

38:06.343 --> 38:09.511
and you have to trust me, all
right?

38:09.513 --> 38:10.713
Okay.

38:20.056 --> 38:22.424
See, just like riding a bike.

38:22.426 --> 38:25.826
If the bike had a mind of its
own.

38:25.828 --> 38:28.330
Come on.

38:28.332 --> 38:29.333
Come on.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.500
- Dad?
- Come on, come on,

38:32.502 --> 38:34.101
come on, come on, come here.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.138
Look it's okay, listen to me.

38:37.574 --> 38:38.841
Listen to me.

38:39.809 --> 38:41.008
You trust me, right?

38:41.010 --> 38:41.844
Yeah.

38:43.012 --> 38:45.014
Okay, you trust me, you trust
Faith,

38:46.082 --> 38:48.318
you trust yourself, you got
this.

38:49.986 --> 38:51.018
- You got this.
- Okay.

38:51.020 --> 38:51.885
Okay.

38:51.887 --> 38:54.054
All right, here we go, come on
Faith,

38:54.056 --> 38:55.155
come on Faith.

38:55.157 --> 38:56.260
Let's go.

38:58.227 --> 38:59.228
Come on.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.865
- I'm doing it.
- Look at you!

39:04.867 --> 39:07.067
You're a natural born cowgirl.

39:07.069 --> 39:07.970
Yeah, okay.

39:18.482 --> 39:21.316
I'm worried about you.

39:21.318 --> 39:22.352
Did you ask for help?

39:24.454 --> 39:26.523
You know, for guidance?

39:31.295 --> 39:33.262
Pastor Williams asked me about
you.

39:37.367 --> 39:39.436
He actually came by here the
other day.

39:41.270 --> 39:42.372
Did you talk to him?

39:44.240 --> 39:45.908
No, I didn't wanna see him.

39:47.209 --> 39:48.210
Why not?

39:50.380 --> 39:53.013
Because the last time I saw
him

39:53.015 --> 39:54.351
he was burying my father.

39:57.253 --> 39:59.855
He's worried about you
and your mom, you know.

40:05.495 --> 40:07.963
Do you wanna come to
church with me on Sunday?

40:10.132 --> 40:11.133
Not really.

40:12.068 --> 40:14.003
Even if I want you to?

40:15.938 --> 40:17.873
I know you do, but why?

40:21.944 --> 40:24.244
Because I like spending
time with you there.

40:24.246 --> 40:26.516
With everything going on
in your life right now,

40:28.217 --> 40:31.686
I think it could be really good
for you.

40:47.604 --> 40:48.971
Here you go.

40:50.940 --> 40:51.941
Thank you.

40:54.511 --> 40:55.512
Hungry?

40:58.548 --> 40:59.549
Wait.

41:01.618 --> 41:02.617
What?

41:02.619 --> 41:04.421
Why don't we give thanks.

41:05.988 --> 41:07.422
Really?

41:07.424 --> 41:09.123
Sure.

41:09.125 --> 41:11.559
I mean, we used to do it all the
time.

41:11.561 --> 41:14.330
But we haven't since Dad
passed.

41:16.098 --> 41:18.031
I know, but I think

41:18.033 --> 41:21.137
that we should start
again, especially now.

41:22.271 --> 41:24.304
I really don't feel like it.

41:24.306 --> 41:26.006
Come on, Grace.

41:26.008 --> 41:28.275
I'm sorry Mom, but no.

41:28.277 --> 41:31.646
You know that your dad
named your horse Faith

41:31.648 --> 41:32.649
for a reason?

41:35.452 --> 41:37.920
It's because he always
wanted you to have it.

41:40.189 --> 41:44.494
He never wanted you to quit
believing in him or in God.

42:19.328 --> 42:21.328
Oh, look at you.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.196
- Hi!
- How you doing?

42:22.198 --> 42:23.330
Let me help you with that.

42:23.332 --> 42:24.264
Oh, it's all right.

42:24.266 --> 42:26.300
No, it's not all right, let me
help you.

42:26.302 --> 42:28.703
Helping people is kind
of what I do, right?

42:28.705 --> 42:31.238
I didn't realize how heavy it
was.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.575
You gonna topple over here by
yourself,

42:33.577 --> 42:34.578
the wind's blowing.

42:38.582 --> 42:41.181
Yeah, it's kind of my job
to help people, Rebecca.

42:41.183 --> 42:43.083
Well, I don't think
carrying heavy furniture

42:43.085 --> 42:44.486
was on your resume to be a
pastor.

42:44.488 --> 42:47.354
Well, I don't think you
remember who I work for.

42:47.356 --> 42:50.226
I mean, God's my boss,
he's watching me 24/7.

43:06.242 --> 43:09.276
Did I ever tell you why I became
a pastor?

43:09.278 --> 43:12.081
No, no, you actually never
did.

43:13.517 --> 43:15.117
I don't talk about it much.

43:17.319 --> 43:18.586
In fact, I've never even told
Mike

43:18.588 --> 43:20.155
what I'm about to tell you.

43:25.795 --> 43:29.231
Growing up, my childhood was
rough.

43:30.432 --> 43:33.135
I got into a lot of trouble.

43:36.305 --> 43:38.642
I can't tell you how many times
I got kicked out of school.

43:41.377 --> 43:43.312
But eventually I turned my life
around.

43:44.280 --> 43:48.115
You know, I found Christ and
one thing just led to another,

43:48.117 --> 43:49.485
I found my self in church more.

43:50.486 --> 43:52.386
And I don't even think
that was a mere accident

43:52.388 --> 43:55.289
because that's where I
meet Sandra, my wife,

43:55.291 --> 43:58.093
and here I am.

43:59.663 --> 44:03.767
And that's what I wanna
do with my life now.

44:05.301 --> 44:08.435
I wanna help other people
turn their lives around.

44:08.437 --> 44:11.338
A widowed mom whose house
is about to be foreclosed,

44:11.340 --> 44:13.108
you sure know how to pick them.

44:14.376 --> 44:15.845
God knows how to pick them.

44:20.182 --> 44:21.183
And he picked me.

44:25.454 --> 44:26.455
He picked me.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.360
God saved me.

44:35.331 --> 44:36.265
And that's what I believe.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.370
I believe he wants me
to save other people.

44:44.206 --> 44:47.307
And that's what I wanna spend
the rest of my life doing.

44:47.309 --> 44:50.512
So I'm telling you, not
just as your pastor,

44:51.715 --> 44:56.720
but as your friend, let me help
you.

44:59.421 --> 45:00.822
You don't owe me anything.

45:00.824 --> 45:02.324
Yes, I do.

45:03.592 --> 45:06.630
Rebecca listen, we don't have
a church without you and Mike.

45:08.197 --> 45:10.399
Mike helped me build God a home.

45:14.236 --> 45:17.473
At least let me help
you try and save yours.

45:18.875 --> 45:21.443
Well good morning everybody,
thanks for coming!

45:23.379 --> 45:25.880
All right, beautiful day, I'm
excited and I hope that you,

45:25.882 --> 45:29.216
well you know what, I know,
I know you all are excited

45:29.218 --> 45:31.418
just as much as I am for the
grand opening

45:31.420 --> 45:32.586
of our new church.

45:35.324 --> 45:36.325
Yeah.

45:37.459 --> 45:40.494
Now, while I've always believed
that God has been here,

45:40.496 --> 45:43.263
always been here, let's
just say that he's got

45:43.265 --> 45:46.870
another place, another home
to call his own, right?

45:50.506 --> 45:52.374
Before I do the ceremonial
ribbon cut,

45:53.442 --> 45:56.443
there is just one person
we all have to thank.

45:56.445 --> 45:59.381
Besides the Lord, of course,
don't wanna forget him.

46:00.917 --> 46:04.420
But this someone, he
made this all possible

46:05.387 --> 46:06.588
and made my dream a reality.

46:08.457 --> 46:11.260
Big Mike, come on up.

46:15.297 --> 46:18.833
Now, he doesn't know
this, but he's the one

46:18.835 --> 46:20.534
that's gonna make this
ceremonial ribbon cut.

46:20.536 --> 46:23.470
Mike, you're gonna do it, come
on man.

46:23.472 --> 46:24.473
Yeah.

46:25.641 --> 46:27.742
Hey, thank you, thank you,
I appreciate the applause,

46:27.744 --> 46:32.914
but really truly, you should
be applauding yourself

46:32.916 --> 46:36.616
because while it's true
I did help convince

46:36.618 --> 46:39.286
Pastor Williams to come
here in the first place,

46:39.288 --> 46:41.789
I really wasn't sure
whether or not this town

46:41.791 --> 46:43.292
even wanted a church.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.493
But we restored this beautiful
building,

46:46.495 --> 46:50.530
it is a picturesque
little church, beautiful.

46:50.532 --> 46:54.503
And guess what, we have you,
you are here, yes, yeah.

46:59.308 --> 47:02.009
Now, it's true, this building,
it's a great building.

47:02.011 --> 47:06.680
But without you, it would just
be a great empty building.

47:06.682 --> 47:09.616
So truly I mean it, from the
bottom of my heart, thank you.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.451
Thank you for being here,
and thank you of course,

47:11.453 --> 47:13.520
to Pastor for being here.

47:13.522 --> 47:18.692
He's become a wonderful,
integral part of our family

47:18.694 --> 47:20.494
and I know that he's going
to become a wonderful,

47:20.496 --> 47:23.663
integral part of your families
as well.

47:23.665 --> 47:26.466
So without further ado, shall
we?

47:52.796 --> 47:53.995
This is beautiful.

47:53.997 --> 47:54.829
How much for that?

47:54.831 --> 47:56.563
Uh, 20 bucks, yeah.

47:56.565 --> 47:57.999
I think somebody might
be coming back for it,

47:58.001 --> 47:59.666
but there's records in here too.

47:59.668 --> 48:01.004
Dollar a record, so yeah.

48:02.504 --> 48:03.570
Do you wanna buy this one?

48:03.572 --> 48:06.107
All right, I guess I
can take off another 600,

48:06.109 --> 48:07.875
but that's as low as I can go.

48:07.877 --> 48:08.775
I'll take it.

48:08.777 --> 48:11.578
All right, I'll go get the
paperwork.

48:11.580 --> 48:12.581
Great, thanks.

48:17.921 --> 48:19.786
Hey, what's up, what's wrong?

48:19.788 --> 48:21.923
I don't think we're making
enough.

48:21.925 --> 48:25.094
It's still early, you
just have to have some hope.

48:28.397 --> 48:30.932
I'm just saying you can't
do it alone, you know.

48:30.934 --> 48:32.566
So what, you want me to go to
church

48:32.568 --> 48:34.668
and ask God for help, no.

50:21.877 --> 50:22.911
So how'd we do?

50:29.052 --> 50:32.654
I know it looks bad,
but look, don't give up.

50:41.897 --> 50:43.064
Hey.

50:43.066 --> 50:44.265
Hey.

50:44.267 --> 50:45.467
How you doing?

50:46.735 --> 50:47.736
Fine.

50:49.638 --> 50:51.007
Today was a disaster.

50:53.742 --> 50:56.778
The worst part is my mom's
gonna wanna sell Faith next.

50:59.248 --> 51:01.548
Seems like your mom's gonna
wanna sell everything she can

51:01.550 --> 51:02.718
before losing Faith.

51:03.652 --> 51:04.686
I'm not gonna let her.

51:06.255 --> 51:08.623
I lost my dad, I can't lose her
too.

51:10.659 --> 51:11.793
So what are you gonna do?

51:14.896 --> 51:15.697
I don't know.

51:17.833 --> 51:19.901
But if I lose her I'll have
nothing left.

51:20.936 --> 51:22.704
Yeah, but I mean, what's
worse,

51:24.140 --> 51:26.075
losing your horse or losing your
home?

51:26.975 --> 51:29.076
She's not just any horse.

51:29.078 --> 51:30.144
No, I know that, but...

51:30.146 --> 51:33.849
Faith is everything to
me, she's my best friend.

51:34.683 --> 51:36.252
Where are you gonna go, Grace?

51:37.153 --> 51:39.053
Where are you gonna live?

51:39.055 --> 51:40.787
I can't believe you're saying
this.

51:40.789 --> 51:43.324
So what, you just think
I should get rid of her?

51:43.326 --> 51:44.524
No, that's not what I'm
saying.

51:44.526 --> 51:47.794
Look, this isn't Faith's
fault that things got this bad,

51:47.796 --> 51:49.330
why should she be punished?

51:49.332 --> 51:50.532
She shouldn't.

51:53.969 --> 51:56.603
But if she's the only chance
that the ranch has left

51:56.605 --> 51:57.773
than maybe your mom's right.

51:59.175 --> 52:01.543
Maybe you don't have a
choice but to sell her.

52:03.712 --> 52:04.946
Just go home, Chris.

52:07.949 --> 52:09.015
What?

52:09.017 --> 52:10.752
Go home.

52:12.921 --> 52:14.623
I'm just trying to help.

52:16.858 --> 52:18.359
Grace, please.

52:18.361 --> 52:20.094
Did you hear me?

52:20.096 --> 52:21.696
I said I want you to leave!

52:42.751 --> 52:45.852
I'm not gonna let them take you
from me.

52:45.854 --> 52:48.757
If I lose the ranch then fine,
but I'm not gonna lose you.

52:52.994 --> 52:55.061
I'm really very
proud of you, you know that?

52:55.063 --> 52:56.830
Why?

52:56.832 --> 52:58.365
You've been feeding her,
exercising her,

52:58.367 --> 53:01.034
grooming her, taking great care
of her.

53:01.036 --> 53:02.936
Well, I enjoy it.

53:02.938 --> 53:04.039
Makes her so happy.

53:07.243 --> 53:08.910
Listen sweetheart, when I'm
gone,

53:10.946 --> 53:13.014
I want you to know I'm
counting on you, okay?

53:15.418 --> 53:18.818
Keep taking care of her, protect
her,

53:18.820 --> 53:20.387
make sure she's safe.

53:20.389 --> 53:23.089
Keep her groomed, keep her fed,
exercised.

53:23.091 --> 53:26.059
Whoa, hey hey hey, it's okay,

53:26.061 --> 53:27.095
it's all right, it's all right.

53:27.896 --> 53:30.029
Come on Faith, down, there you
go.

53:30.031 --> 53:30.864
Got her?

53:30.866 --> 53:31.931
Yeah, I got her.

53:31.933 --> 53:32.901
Thanks, Dad.

53:36.071 --> 53:37.072
Stay.

53:38.006 --> 53:39.342
Okay, good girl.

54:39.034 --> 54:40.267
Hello?

54:40.269 --> 54:42.469
I've been trying to
reach you urgently, Mrs. Evans.

54:42.471 --> 54:45.171
Please, I need more time.

54:45.173 --> 54:47.040
We keep giving you more
time,

54:47.042 --> 54:50.344
we filed extension after
extension after you missed

54:50.346 --> 54:53.012
one mortgage payment after
another.

54:53.014 --> 54:54.013
I realize that, but...

54:54.015 --> 54:57.050
And I am sorry,
Mrs. Evans, I really am,

54:57.052 --> 55:00.053
but as you are aware,
your ranch is scheduled

55:00.055 --> 55:02.323
for foreclosure on Monday.

55:02.325 --> 55:04.192
There's nothing more that we can
do.

55:08.797 --> 55:11.164
What time do I have until
exactly?

55:11.166 --> 55:13.034
Monday morning, nine
a.m.

55:14.869 --> 55:17.973
I suggest you remove all your
personal belongings by then

55:19.207 --> 55:22.345
when the ranch will officially
become the bank's property.

55:29.217 --> 55:32.185
What about me, what about my
daughter?

55:32.187 --> 55:36.055
Anyone found on sight
will be forcefully removed

55:36.057 --> 55:38.525
by the sheriff, but I trust
it won't come to that.

55:52.575 --> 55:56.042
Hi.

55:56.044 --> 55:59.280
Sorry, didn't mean to startle
you.

55:59.282 --> 56:02.081
My name is Luke Stark.

56:02.083 --> 56:04.387
I own a cattle ranch just
across the state line.

56:06.455 --> 56:08.955
Nice to meet you, how can I
help you?

56:08.957 --> 56:10.123
Well, I was driving through
town

56:10.125 --> 56:13.026
and I saw your sign for an
estate sale.

56:13.028 --> 56:14.561
Although, from the looks of it,
it seems

56:14.563 --> 56:17.063
that I got here a little too
late.

56:17.065 --> 56:20.266
I was checking out some of
your ranching equipment.

56:20.268 --> 56:22.969
But, unfortunately,
you don't have anything

56:22.971 --> 56:24.105
I don't already have.

56:25.974 --> 56:29.412
I did notice, though, that white
horse.

56:32.381 --> 56:33.382
Is she for sale?

56:57.406 --> 56:59.408
Yeah, well my daughters.

57:04.245 --> 57:07.113
Oh yeah, that's a good girl,
there you go.

57:07.115 --> 57:09.982
No, wait, what are you doing!

57:09.984 --> 57:11.117
No, get off of me!

57:11.119 --> 57:13.219
You can't take my horse!

57:13.221 --> 57:14.588
I'm afraid I already bought
her.

57:14.590 --> 57:18.124
No sir, please, you can't
take her away from me!

57:18.126 --> 57:21.262
I'm sorry, I really am,
but I already bought her.

57:23.366 --> 57:24.964
Mom, Mom, you can't do this!

57:24.966 --> 57:27.534
It's the last thing I want to
do, but...

57:27.536 --> 57:30.303
Is that even enough
money to pay off the bank?

57:30.305 --> 57:33.206
No, it's not, but this
with the other money

57:33.208 --> 57:35.174
it can pay back some of it and
maybe

57:35.176 --> 57:37.143
I can call the bank and
negotiate.

57:37.145 --> 57:38.447
Maybe, maybe!

57:40.248 --> 57:42.483
Listen, your horse will be in
good hands

57:42.485 --> 57:44.050
with me and my daughter.

57:44.052 --> 57:46.387
I promise you, we'll
take great care of her,

57:46.389 --> 57:48.254
we'll treat her like family.

57:48.256 --> 57:50.626
She already has a family!

57:53.261 --> 57:54.695
No.

57:54.697 --> 57:55.897
Good luck.

57:57.365 --> 57:59.232
No, no Mom, it's not too late,

57:59.234 --> 58:00.366
you don't have to do this.

58:00.368 --> 58:01.535
You can give him the money back.

58:01.537 --> 58:06.339
No I can't, I have no choice.

58:06.341 --> 58:07.576
Faith, Faith!

58:13.047 --> 58:14.115
Faith, Faith!

58:16.017 --> 58:17.018
No!

59:07.101 --> 59:09.170
I feel like I just ripped her
heart out.

59:18.814 --> 59:21.015
Shes' been through so much
and...

59:27.756 --> 59:31.292
Instead of making it easier on
her,

59:34.162 --> 59:35.731
I just made it a whole lot
worse.

59:45.173 --> 59:47.408
It's better that we lose our
home?

59:54.850 --> 59:56.652
I'm doing my best here.

59:58.219 --> 59:59.387
Without my husband.

1:00:04.359 --> 1:00:06.461
You know how hard this has been
on me.

1:00:10.465 --> 1:00:14.402
And now we sold everything that
we own,

1:00:16.137 --> 1:00:17.272
if you can hear me

1:00:20.508 --> 1:00:22.545
I need you now more than ever.

1:00:28.784 --> 1:00:30.285
I could use some miracle.

1:00:37.258 --> 1:00:42.163
God, I know that it's been a
while.

1:00:47.168 --> 1:00:49.504
It's just hard for me after my
dad passed.

1:00:54.409 --> 1:00:56.511
When you first took my dad from
me.

1:01:00.415 --> 1:01:01.416
And then Faith.

1:01:07.690 --> 1:01:09.756
And it looks like you're
going to take my home

1:01:09.758 --> 1:01:10.759
from me now too.

1:01:14.395 --> 1:01:16.497
What did I do to deserve this?

1:01:18.466 --> 1:01:20.603
I'm sorry that sometimes I lost
hope

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:23.471
and even my faith.

1:01:26.875 --> 1:01:31.346
I'm not as strong as I
wanna be, as I should be.

1:01:35.416 --> 1:01:38.152
I'm asking that you bless
us and watch over us.

1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:46.327
I trust you.

1:01:49.898 --> 1:01:52.231
And I believe that you have a
plan

1:01:52.233 --> 1:01:53.869
and that you know what's best.

1:01:57.773 --> 1:02:00.441
I know that you're protecting me

1:02:01.910 --> 1:02:03.511
and watching over me.

1:02:07.248 --> 1:02:09.582
And I know that my dad is too.

1:02:23.799 --> 1:02:24.800
Can I come in?

1:02:25.633 --> 1:02:26.634
Sure.

1:02:27.670 --> 1:02:29.270
Are we homeless yet, Mom?

1:02:32.340 --> 1:02:33.341
That's not funny.

1:02:38.613 --> 1:02:39.545
I just wanted to let you know

1:02:39.547 --> 1:02:40.816
that I'm going out to church.

1:02:42.550 --> 1:02:45.520
Can you wait a few
minutes before you go?

1:02:49.657 --> 1:02:50.658
Yeah.

1:02:58.566 --> 1:03:01.667
I'm really glad you decided
to come with me today.

1:03:01.669 --> 1:03:02.470
Me too.

1:03:06.875 --> 1:03:11.410
Hey Mom, I'm really sorry
for the way I acted.

1:03:11.412 --> 1:03:14.850
I, I was scared.

1:03:20.055 --> 1:03:21.056
I know, sweetie.

1:03:23.859 --> 1:03:28.463
I realize now that
everything's gonna work out.

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:32.567
How do you know that?

1:03:35.470 --> 1:03:37.538
Hope and faith, remember?

1:03:42.878 --> 1:03:44.545
I'll be right back.

1:03:59.393 --> 1:04:00.394
Hey, Chris.

1:04:01.096 --> 1:04:01.962
Hey.

1:04:01.964 --> 1:04:03.864
Can I talk to you for
a sec?

1:04:03.866 --> 1:04:04.665
Yeah.

1:04:08.603 --> 1:04:10.469
I'm surprised you came to church
today.

1:04:10.471 --> 1:04:14.074
I know, I know, but I needed
to tell you

1:04:14.076 --> 1:04:16.677
that I'm sorry.

1:04:19.413 --> 1:04:22.818
You were just trying to help
me and I pushed you away.

1:04:29.124 --> 1:04:30.658
Can you forgive me?

1:04:37.732 --> 1:04:38.533
Of course.

1:04:41.136 --> 1:04:42.635
Although, I don't think I have a
choice

1:04:42.637 --> 1:04:43.939
given that we're at church.

1:04:47.976 --> 1:04:51.612
Maybe we can talk some
more after the service?

1:04:52.848 --> 1:04:54.948
Yeah, I'd like that.

1:04:54.950 --> 1:04:55.951
Okay.

1:04:57.451 --> 1:04:58.551
Should we head in?

1:04:58.553 --> 1:04:59.554
Yeah.

1:05:02.657 --> 1:05:06.962
You know I've been talking
a lot about hope and faith.

1:05:07.863 --> 1:05:10.833
But today I wanna add a
third virtue to the list.

1:05:13.836 --> 1:05:17.469
And that's the virtue of
charity.

1:05:17.471 --> 1:05:21.109
First Corinthians chapter
13, and now by hope,

1:05:22.077 --> 1:05:23.811
faith, and charity.

1:05:27.615 --> 1:05:29.918
And then Paul goes on to say
that,

1:05:30.818 --> 1:05:35.823
of these three, charity is the
greatest.

1:05:37.758 --> 1:05:38.861
And it got me to thinking,

1:05:41.729 --> 1:05:42.761
raise your hand if you've ever

1:05:42.763 --> 1:05:45.131
given somebody something before.

1:05:45.133 --> 1:05:47.499
Now, we all give.

1:05:47.501 --> 1:05:52.406
Money, clothing, any kind of
aid.

1:05:53.075 --> 1:05:56.444
And this should be the
way we all aspire to live.

1:05:57.112 --> 1:06:00.414
Each and every one of
you sitting here today,

1:06:01.849 --> 1:06:05.519
you should feel a
obligation to give charity.

1:06:06.821 --> 1:06:07.822
And you know why?

1:06:09.624 --> 1:06:14.629
Because giving charity
is also giving love.

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:24.605
Love, when we love, that same
love increases hope and faith

1:06:27.742 --> 1:06:29.177
in those that receive it.

1:06:30.544 --> 1:06:34.247
There's a personal reason
why I chose to add charity

1:06:34.249 --> 1:06:35.449
to my sermon today.

1:06:41.856 --> 1:06:46.661
Inspiration, and not just from
God,

1:06:48.796 --> 1:06:52.767
but also from each and
every one of you here today.

1:06:55.636 --> 1:06:57.940
The proud members of this
community

1:07:00.574 --> 1:07:04.478
and members of this church,
that I love so much.

1:07:08.783 --> 1:07:12.486
You guys inspire me.

1:07:13.654 --> 1:07:18.659
You saw a need from a
family and you came together

1:07:19.827 --> 1:07:23.531
and you unified and you met that
need.

1:07:28.170 --> 1:07:31.071
But this just wasn't any old
family

1:07:31.073 --> 1:07:32.174
that you took care of.

1:07:34.942 --> 1:07:39.247
See, without this family,
we wouldn't have a church.

1:07:41.116 --> 1:07:43.649
Without this family we
would not be sitting

1:07:43.651 --> 1:07:45.619
where we are right now.

1:07:46.921 --> 1:07:47.922
Here's a family.

1:08:02.937 --> 1:08:04.739
You prayed for a miracle.

1:08:10.312 --> 1:08:11.746
Go on, open it.

1:08:19.754 --> 1:08:22.057
That's from everybody here.

1:08:40.875 --> 1:08:41.907
How did you?

1:08:41.909 --> 1:08:44.009
I opened up a charity.

1:08:44.011 --> 1:08:47.049
I wanted to see you save
your home, we all did.

1:08:49.016 --> 1:08:49.817
Thank you.

1:08:50.718 --> 1:08:53.821
Thank you, thank all of you,
thank you.

1:08:56.757 --> 1:08:58.624
I never asked for any charity.

1:08:58.626 --> 1:08:59.426
We know.

1:08:59.428 --> 1:09:00.926
And I didn't want any
handouts.

1:09:00.928 --> 1:09:02.164
We know that too, Rebecca.

1:09:03.898 --> 1:09:06.632
How could I take this, it's
too much.

1:09:06.634 --> 1:09:08.803
Rebecca, listen, everybody
here,

1:09:10.037 --> 1:09:11.703
they all know what you and your
family

1:09:11.705 --> 1:09:15.108
has done for both the
church and the country

1:09:15.110 --> 1:09:16.078
that they love so much.

1:09:17.912 --> 1:09:20.180
They were pleased, pleased
to open their hearts

1:09:20.182 --> 1:09:23.584
and their wallets to you and
Grace.

1:09:25.287 --> 1:09:26.987
They love you, we all do.

1:09:37.932 --> 1:09:39.898
I'm glad I was able
to reach you, Mr. Clark.

1:09:39.900 --> 1:09:41.934
Of course, I realize
your deadline

1:09:41.936 --> 1:09:43.001
is tomorrow morning.

1:09:43.003 --> 1:09:45.037
I know, that's why I called.

1:09:45.039 --> 1:09:48.108
I wanna let you know that
I have everything I need

1:09:48.110 --> 1:09:49.908
to pay what I owe.

1:09:49.910 --> 1:09:51.244
You have it all, really?

1:09:51.246 --> 1:09:52.479
I sure do.

1:09:52.481 --> 1:09:56.149
Well, you certainly
left it right down to the wire.

1:09:56.151 --> 1:10:00.953
I did, but what's important
is that I have it now.

1:10:00.955 --> 1:10:03.989
This ranch is gonna stay
ours, not the bank's.

1:10:03.991 --> 1:10:05.993
My daughter and I aren't going
anywhere.

1:10:11.799 --> 1:10:13.834
I think we're really gonna
like it here.

1:10:16.138 --> 1:10:16.937
I think so too.

1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:20.674
Perfect spot for us to plant
our roots.

1:10:27.149 --> 1:10:32.154
I want this to be our
home, and Grace's, forever.

1:10:36.291 --> 1:10:37.359
It will be.

1:10:55.009 --> 1:10:56.808
I can't believe what
everyone at the church

1:10:56.810 --> 1:10:57.510
did for us.

1:10:57.512 --> 1:11:00.313
I know, me neither.

1:11:00.315 --> 1:11:02.482
And you're sure it's enough?

1:11:02.484 --> 1:11:06.818
With this and the rest
of the money, it is.

1:11:06.820 --> 1:11:08.055
I already talked to the bank.

1:11:12.460 --> 1:11:13.461
You okay?

1:11:15.497 --> 1:11:18.966
I'm so happy that we didn't
lose the house, it's just...

1:11:26.173 --> 1:11:28.108
What's he doing here?

1:11:40.488 --> 1:11:43.757
Afternoon, Mrs. Evans, and
Grace.

1:11:44.426 --> 1:11:45.859
How's Faith doing?

1:11:47.229 --> 1:11:48.929
Not so great, actually.

1:11:50.130 --> 1:11:52.232
What do you mean, what
happened?

1:11:52.234 --> 1:11:54.434
Well, to tell you the truth,

1:11:54.436 --> 1:11:55.936
seems like she's homesick.

1:11:56.904 --> 1:11:57.905
What?

1:11:58.540 --> 1:12:00.074
I think she missed you a lot.

1:12:01.243 --> 1:12:04.479
But you know what, I think
you should ask her yourself.

1:12:06.113 --> 1:12:07.114
Faith.

1:12:12.953 --> 1:12:14.454
Thank you again, so much.

1:12:14.456 --> 1:12:15.457
My pleasure.

1:12:17.091 --> 1:12:19.394
I don't understand, is she
ours again?

1:12:21.095 --> 1:12:23.263
I called Mr. Stark from
church.

1:12:23.265 --> 1:12:25.265
But before she could even say
anything

1:12:25.267 --> 1:12:28.601
I already told her I wanted
you to have your horse back.

1:12:28.603 --> 1:12:30.002
I couldn't sleep at all knowing

1:12:30.004 --> 1:12:31.138
I'd torn her away from you.

1:12:32.540 --> 1:12:34.106
Broke my heart.

1:12:34.108 --> 1:12:35.275
I offered to buy her back,

1:12:35.277 --> 1:12:38.178
but he told me just to go
ahead and tear up the check.

1:12:39.179 --> 1:12:40.348
That she'd be yours again.

1:12:43.183 --> 1:12:45.085
Hey Faith, hey Faith.

1:13:05.039 --> 1:13:06.508
Glad you got to keep the
ranch.

1:13:08.142 --> 1:13:11.109
Would have been a travesty
to lose this place.

1:13:11.111 --> 1:13:13.147
We have enough money
to repay the bank now.

1:13:15.450 --> 1:13:18.185
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do next?

1:13:19.186 --> 1:13:22.022
We haven't had time to
come up with a game plan yet,

1:13:23.023 --> 1:13:27.493
but the ranch isn't generating
any revenue for us anymore.

1:13:27.495 --> 1:13:29.364
Well, you should change that.

1:13:36.538 --> 1:13:38.440
Why'd you want Faith to begin
with?

1:13:39.507 --> 1:13:42.375
Well, I have a little girl and
I thought

1:13:42.377 --> 1:13:44.242
she'd love your horse.

1:13:44.244 --> 1:13:46.481
But don't worry, lots of
other horses out there.

1:13:47.981 --> 1:13:49.283
You know how kids love horses.

1:13:53.187 --> 1:13:55.320
Mom, mom, that's it!

1:13:55.322 --> 1:13:57.690
That's how we can get the
ranch making money again.

1:13:57.692 --> 1:13:58.323
What do you mean?

1:13:58.325 --> 1:13:59.191
We can start a business.

1:13:59.193 --> 1:14:01.960
Horse trail rides, horse riding
lessons.

1:14:01.962 --> 1:14:05.032
We have so many acres on our
property that we can use.

1:14:06.300 --> 1:14:07.502
I don't know.

1:14:08.603 --> 1:14:10.670
Mom, we have to give
ourselves a fighting chance

1:14:10.672 --> 1:14:12.440
to hold on to this place
forever.

1:14:14.542 --> 1:14:18.578
Well, it's a good idea,
but where are we gonna

1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:21.179
come up with the money to buy
more horses?

1:14:21.181 --> 1:14:23.183
You could always bring on a
partner.

1:14:26.388 --> 1:14:27.187
Really?

1:14:28.188 --> 1:14:30.357
Well, I'd least give
it some serious thought.

1:14:31.659 --> 1:14:33.426
My daughter is much younger than
you

1:14:33.428 --> 1:14:36.997
but she absolutely adores
horses, as do I.

1:14:38.966 --> 1:14:42.002
And there aren't any other
businesses in the area like it.

1:14:44.606 --> 1:14:46.541
Think you can come up with a
good name?

1:14:50.310 --> 1:14:53.111
Hope Ranch has
now become a reality.

1:14:53.113 --> 1:14:54.414
With Luke's help we went out

1:14:54.416 --> 1:14:56.083
and bought some beautiful
horses.

1:14:58.420 --> 1:15:01.153
But while all of our new
horses are beautiful,

1:15:01.155 --> 1:15:04.457
Faith is, of course, still my
favorite.

1:15:04.459 --> 1:15:06.391
I watched your game yesterday.

1:15:06.393 --> 1:15:07.259
Really?

1:15:07.261 --> 1:15:09.294
Why didn't you tell me?

1:15:09.296 --> 1:15:11.229
I thought if you knew I was
watching you

1:15:11.231 --> 1:15:12.732
it would throw you off.

1:15:12.734 --> 1:15:14.436
It probably would have, yeah.

1:15:16.103 --> 1:15:19.137
But, that catch you made
was pretty incredible.

1:15:19.139 --> 1:15:20.340
I was so proud of you.

1:15:22.644 --> 1:15:25.010
I'm really proud of you too,
you know?

1:15:25.012 --> 1:15:26.446
For what?

1:15:26.448 --> 1:15:28.115
For everything you've done
here.

1:15:29.116 --> 1:15:30.184
And for not giving up.

1:15:31.218 --> 1:15:32.219
Thank you.

1:16:03.417 --> 1:16:04.418
Whoa.

1:16:05.352 --> 1:16:06.420
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1:16:16.396 --> 1:16:18.831
Mom and I have already signed
up all the local schools

1:16:18.833 --> 1:16:21.534
for class field trips
and adults of all ages

1:16:21.536 --> 1:16:24.238
are coming too for
horseback riding lessons.

1:16:25.372 --> 1:16:27.840
It's going to take a lot of hard
work

1:16:27.842 --> 1:16:30.510
but we're excited and we all
know

1:16:30.512 --> 1:16:32.277
that Hope Ranch will be a
success.
