WEBVTT

00:11.260 --> 00:12.820
So, here's the deal.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.740
We are in the garden, right?

00:14.780 --> 00:16.580
And everything is great.

00:16.660 --> 00:17.900
And there's this tree.

00:17.980 --> 00:20.540
And the man says,
"Ooh, see that tree?

00:20.620 --> 00:22.460
"Don't eat the fruit
of that tree.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.700
"That apple you do not eat."

00:24.740 --> 00:26.620
He goes inside,
names some animals...

00:26.700 --> 00:28.140
maybe takes a dump.

00:28.220 --> 00:31.500
Anyway, what does she do?

00:31.580 --> 00:33.020
She eats the apple!

00:33.100 --> 00:34.740
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

00:34.780 --> 00:36.620
He says, "Don't eat it!"
She eats it!

00:36.700 --> 00:38.300
Unbelievable!

00:38.340 --> 00:41.420
Since then, men, women...
I don't know.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.780
It's all going wrong!

00:42.860 --> 00:44.460
So inviting

00:44.540 --> 00:46.580
So exciting

00:46.620 --> 00:48.060
Whenever you're near

00:48.100 --> 00:51.220
I hear a symphony

00:51.260 --> 00:54.940
A tender melody

00:54.980 --> 00:57.340
Pulling me closer

00:57.380 --> 00:59.860
Closer to your arms

00:59.940 --> 01:02.140
Then suddenly

01:02.220 --> 01:04.819
Your lips are touching mine

01:06.140 --> 01:09.020
A feeling so divine

01:09.100 --> 01:12.820
Till I leave the past behind

01:12.860 --> 01:15.580
I'm lost in a world

01:15.660 --> 01:18.500
Of make-believe

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074

01:30.780 --> 01:33.060
Whenever you're near

01:34.100 --> 01:37.580
I hear a symphony...

01:39.740 --> 01:41.300
Divorce.

01:42.940 --> 01:45.020
Miserable marriage.

01:46.260 --> 01:48.860
Wedding canceled.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.340
Remarried.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.460
Divorced again.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.580
Ahh!

01:53.660 --> 01:56.380
Irreconcilable
sexual disharmony!

01:56.420 --> 01:58.700
Dysfunctional marriage!

01:58.780 --> 02:00.820
Divorce! Divorce!

02:00.860 --> 02:02.900
Divorce! Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!

02:04.860 --> 02:06.420
Well?

02:06.500 --> 02:07.620
Talk to me.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.139
We had a bad run.

02:09.180 --> 02:10.380
Things have changed down there.

02:10.460 --> 02:12.460
Men and women
aren't like they used to be.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.540
Well, things are
changing up here as well.

02:15.580 --> 02:16.860
I'm getting pressure
from above...

02:16.900 --> 02:18.980
if you know what I mean,
for results!

02:19.060 --> 02:23.060
For men and women to be bonded
in eternal bliss.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.100
In the meantime, I've been
instructed to introduce...

02:26.180 --> 02:28.500
new incentive schemes
for our leading operatives.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.980
Leading operatives, huh?

02:31.060 --> 02:32.100
That's you.

02:32.180 --> 02:35.140
Skip the flattery,
Gabriel. Where's the beef?

02:38.300 --> 02:40.540
It's a hard case to crack.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.580
I have full confidence
you can do it.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.900
If you don't...

02:43.980 --> 02:45.140
you don't come back.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.060
What?

02:47.100 --> 02:48.460
No way.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.660
That's the new incentive scheme.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.700
Your mission
is to unite man and woman...

02:53.780 --> 02:56.180
blah, blah, blah, blah, OK?

02:56.260 --> 02:57.780
When you're done...

02:57.860 --> 03:00.140
you come back.

03:00.220 --> 03:01.620
If youfail...

03:03.780 --> 03:05.620
you stay down there forever.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.540
You are not serious.

03:07.580 --> 03:10.860
Liberatum mani.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.060
It's out of my hands.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.860
No ordinary sin

03:39.260 --> 03:44.420
This perfect working order

03:44.500 --> 03:48.500
I'd rather sink than swim

03:49.620 --> 03:54.900
If I can't walk on water

03:54.980 --> 03:59.100
Let the scandal in

04:00.060 --> 04:05.380
This perfect world disorder

04:05.460 --> 04:10.100
I'd rather drown than swim

04:10.140 --> 04:15.820
I can't walk on water

04:15.900 --> 04:21.420
This taste of dilution

04:21.500 --> 04:25.260
Velvet divorce

04:25.340 --> 04:27.140
I get bored

04:27.220 --> 04:30.620
Velvet divorce

04:30.700 --> 04:32.020
I get bored

04:32.060 --> 04:35.180
Velvet divorce

04:37.300 --> 04:40.620
Velvet divorce

04:40.700 --> 04:43.380
I get bored

04:58.940 --> 05:00.540
She's the secret daughter...

05:00.620 --> 05:03.420
of Marilyn Monroe
and John F. Kennedy, right?

05:05.860 --> 05:08.700
I mean, that's why Marilyn
was murdered.

05:08.780 --> 05:11.580
So, the young girl
grows up in an orphanage...

05:11.660 --> 05:13.820
unaware of
her incredible parentage.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.100
Years go by.

05:15.180 --> 05:16.300
She's beautiful.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.860
She's smart.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.540
She's successful, OK?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.540
Then what?

05:21.620 --> 05:22.940
Well, then...

05:24.220 --> 05:26.940
Then she gets sent to London
as U.S. ambassador.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.860
Where she discovers
who she is...

05:28.940 --> 05:31.780
and also unravels
the secret of the Nazi gold...

05:31.860 --> 05:34.020
hidden underneath the embassy.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.100
Uh, yeah.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.260
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.300
Of course it's obvious, guys.
It's a trash novel.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.340
You buy it in the airport,
you take it on holiday.

05:46.620 --> 05:48.340
Oh, Ms. Gesteten.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.820
Nice to see you down here.

05:50.900 --> 05:53.860
I'd love to stay and talk,
but, um, you know how things...

05:55.900 --> 05:57.580
Nice trick, Celine.

05:57.660 --> 06:00.220
- Want to try your luck?
- With the gun?

06:00.260 --> 06:01.580
With the fruit.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.900
I don't have time for games.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.820
If you're afraid,
why don't you just say so?

06:07.900 --> 06:11.900
Celine, last night,
we discussed a certain proposal.

06:11.940 --> 06:15.500
And I said no,
because you cheat, Elliot.

06:15.580 --> 06:16.660
OK.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.460
So I'm flirtatious.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.700
It's in my nature.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.500
But I want you to think again.

06:21.540 --> 06:24.500
Do you know how difficult
it is for a woman to find...

06:24.540 --> 06:26.460
a good husband in this town?

06:26.500 --> 06:28.420
Let alone a good dentist.

06:30.340 --> 06:31.420
Celine...

06:33.140 --> 06:34.460
I'm serious.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.820
Robots?

06:37.860 --> 06:40.980
You're telling us we're gonna be
replaced by robots?

06:41.020 --> 06:44.260
That robots will get down on
their robot hands and knees...

06:44.340 --> 06:47.060
and clean the dust out of
every office in this building?

06:47.100 --> 06:48.780
I think not, Ms. Gesteten.

06:48.860 --> 06:53.380
At least the robot won't spend
its time writing a trash novel.

06:53.460 --> 06:57.060
Not even a very good
trash novel, as I understand it.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.100
Oh, I see. This is personal.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.300
This has nothing to do with me,
Robert.

07:03.380 --> 07:07.060
This comes right from the top...
from Mr. Naville himself.

07:07.100 --> 07:10.060
Perhaps it's time
I spoke to this Mr. Naville guy.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.340
It's too late.

07:11.420 --> 07:12.980
You're fired.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.060
You ready?

07:15.100 --> 07:16.420
Mm-hmm.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.820
Now, if you move...

07:19.900 --> 07:21.660
the offer's canceled.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.940
OK.

07:22.980 --> 07:24.620
Mm-hmm.

07:26.340 --> 07:28.340
- Wait, Celine...
- Don't speak.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.940
Do you think this is wise?

07:30.020 --> 07:31.260
Puts me off.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.180
Ha.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.980
Ha.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.740
Stop!

07:37.940 --> 07:39.980
Aah! Aah! Aah!

07:40.060 --> 07:41.100
Mayhew...

07:42.300 --> 07:43.620
Would you call a doctor?

07:45.460 --> 07:47.380
It would be a pleasure, madam.

07:53.580 --> 07:54.540
What are you doing here
this time of day?

07:54.620 --> 07:55.660
Hi, Lily.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.580
Well? Answer me.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.140
Lily, I... I got fired.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.940
They replaced me with a robot.

08:04.020 --> 08:05.300
I know how they feel.

08:05.340 --> 08:06.500
Hmm?

08:06.580 --> 08:10.420
Look, I've been meaning
to tell you this...

08:10.460 --> 08:11.940
for a while now, and...

08:12.020 --> 08:13.460
seems like a good a time as any.

08:14.820 --> 08:17.780
Robert...

08:17.820 --> 08:19.420
I'm leaving you.

08:20.940 --> 08:22.460
You're leaving?
What are you talking about?

08:22.540 --> 08:25.820
His name is Ryan.
He teaches aerobics.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.100
We're in love.
We're moving to Miami.

08:28.180 --> 08:30.980
How can you do this?
At a time like this!

08:31.060 --> 08:32.659
I want a man, not a dreamer.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.900
I don't know what to say.
We could talk about this.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.860
I'll get another job.
We'll sort everything out.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.380
Sorry...

08:38.460 --> 08:40.179
but as of tonight...

08:40.220 --> 08:41.860
you're going home alone.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.380
Uh...

08:45.460 --> 08:46.900
Lily!

09:17.660 --> 09:18.740
I'm leaving you.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.580
You're fired.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.500
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

09:22.580 --> 09:24.220
He teaches aerobics.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.580
We're in love.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.420
We're moving to Miami.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.100
Oh.

09:58.780 --> 10:00.420
Lily?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.540
Lily?

10:11.060 --> 10:12.540
Mr. Robert Lewis?

10:14.340 --> 10:16.020
Yeah, that's me.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.300
My name is Jackson.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.220
This is my associate
Ms. O'Reilly.

10:19.260 --> 10:23.220
We're from the Firm But Fair
Eviction & Collection Agency.

10:23.260 --> 10:26.860
I have a list of certain items
we're empowered to collect...

10:26.940 --> 10:28.580
under federal and state law...

10:28.660 --> 10:30.980
in lieu of unpaid debts.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.660
Furthermore, we are contracted
to serve upon you...

10:33.740 --> 10:37.180
notice of eviction from these
here premises, uh, forthwith.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.740
I beg your pardon?

10:38.780 --> 10:41.300
We can do this
with violence or without.

10:41.340 --> 10:42.580
It's up to you.

10:42.620 --> 10:46.340
The client pays our
medical bills, but not yours.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.460
Well?

10:47.540 --> 10:48.980
Oh, without, please.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.540
Good choice.

10:50.620 --> 10:51.820
OK, let's go.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.100
All right.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.540
Cannot believe this.

11:08.620 --> 11:11.060
Do you have any idea...

11:11.100 --> 11:14.380
how difficult it is to find
a good husband in this town?

11:14.460 --> 11:15.540
Hmm?!

11:16.540 --> 11:18.420
Or a good dentist, come to that?

11:21.700 --> 11:23.540
Playing this sort of game...

11:23.580 --> 11:25.900
you have disgraced yourself
once again.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.220
You caught him
through the frontal lobe...

11:29.300 --> 11:31.100
so apparently he'll live.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.980
But he'll never practice
orthodontics again...

11:33.020 --> 11:34.100
that's for sure.

11:34.140 --> 11:37.340
Mr. Schneider,
call extension 487.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.980
Mr. Schneider,487.

11:42.380 --> 11:45.900
My main fear is you're going
to end up like your mother...

11:45.980 --> 11:49.100
who long ago found her own
natural level in society.

11:49.180 --> 11:52.020
That is to say
she scuttles along the bottom.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.300
Her biggest problem
was marrying a man like you...

11:55.100 --> 11:57.940
a mistake I have taken
great care to avoid.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.180
You...

12:01.220 --> 12:03.220
are gonna go to work, my girl.

12:03.260 --> 12:04.340
What?

12:07.540 --> 12:09.180
You have spent
a quarter of a century...

12:09.260 --> 12:10.700
watching the tide
go in and out...

12:10.780 --> 12:12.820
but from tomorrow,
you are going to work...

12:12.860 --> 12:14.620
here, under my supervision.

12:15.420 --> 12:17.100
You're gonna learn
the essence of business...

12:17.180 --> 12:20.340
about money and how it flows
relentlessly back...

12:20.380 --> 12:22.300
towards he who owns it.

12:22.340 --> 12:23.780
How to generate
a profit from a loss...

12:23.860 --> 12:25.940
a loss from a profit.
You are gonna work.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.500
This may not strike you
as very palatable.

12:31.580 --> 12:32.620
Seven...

12:32.700 --> 12:34.620
It may make you want to vomit.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.220
But you will get used
to the taste.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.820
And pretty soon,
you'll be spooning it down...

12:39.900 --> 12:43.900
and asking for more
like all the other kids.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.180
Eleven...

12:46.260 --> 12:47.820
Mr. Naville, I presume?

12:47.900 --> 12:49.260
Eleven...

12:49.340 --> 12:51.140
You think you can
replace me with a robot?

12:51.220 --> 12:52.580
Eleven...

12:52.660 --> 12:54.420
Well, get this!

12:54.460 --> 12:55.740
Eleven...

12:55.780 --> 12:56.860
Aah!

12:59.660 --> 13:01.420
Twelve...

13:01.500 --> 13:03.380
thirteen...

13:03.460 --> 13:04.500
Fuck.

13:04.580 --> 13:05.980
Fourteen...

13:07.620 --> 13:09.500
Ohh!

13:17.340 --> 13:18.260
Nobody fucking move!

13:18.260 --> 13:19.700
Nobody fucking move!

13:35.540 --> 13:37.420
Aah! Aah!

13:37.500 --> 13:40.900
Aah! Aah!

13:47.980 --> 13:49.220
Everyone on the floor!

13:51.100 --> 13:52.380
Everyone!

13:54.140 --> 13:55.900
Everyone!

13:57.980 --> 14:00.900
Four, five...

14:00.980 --> 14:02.180
six...

14:02.260 --> 14:04.660
seven...

14:10.780 --> 14:11.980
Now, I want my job back!

14:12.060 --> 14:14.580
I want what I had before,
Mr. Naville!

14:14.620 --> 14:15.700
I'm gonna count to five.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.460
If you don't oblige me,
I'm gonna kill you.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.980
One!

14:20.060 --> 14:21.340
Two!

14:21.380 --> 14:22.460
Three!

14:26.460 --> 14:27.940
Four!

14:33.220 --> 14:34.260
Five!

14:34.340 --> 14:36.300
Ow!

14:36.380 --> 14:37.460
- Ow!
- Ow!

14:37.500 --> 14:40.780
- What did you say that for?
- Five comes directly after four.

14:40.860 --> 14:41.940
I know that!

14:42.020 --> 14:43.300
I thought you had a problem.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.740
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

14:44.820 --> 14:46.740
Without access
to a proper education...

14:46.820 --> 14:48.780
- Shut up!
- I was just trying to help.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.620
I don't need any help.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.660
You'll die for this,
I swear to God.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.260
- I'm sorry. No.
- You could shoot him again.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.660
In the head this time.
I'll count to five.

14:57.740 --> 14:59.540
Shut up!

14:59.580 --> 15:00.940
Who are you, anyway?

15:01.020 --> 15:02.100
Nobody!

15:02.140 --> 15:04.380
I'm his daughter.

15:05.340 --> 15:10.020
Aah!

15:14.940 --> 15:16.660
This kid's got a gun.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.020
Hey, cool it.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.780
Take it easy, pal.
Chill out.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.300
Drive!

15:30.620 --> 15:32.140
Will you just drive?!

15:32.220 --> 15:33.420
I can't.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.460
- What?
- I don't know how.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.540
- You don't know how to drive?
- I never learned.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.780
- Why not?!
- I didn't need to!

15:41.820 --> 15:42.980
Well, you do now!

15:43.060 --> 15:44.940
This one makes it go faster,
that one slower.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.060
This is forwards,
that's backwards.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.540
The rest you can pick up
as we go along.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.860
Drive!

16:11.100 --> 16:12.140
Where are we going?

16:12.220 --> 16:14.220
Never mind that.
Just drive more carefully.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.700
He cut in on me.

16:15.780 --> 16:17.860
Mirror, signal, maneuver.

16:34.940 --> 16:37.460
You say nothing, OK?

16:37.500 --> 16:39.740
Afternoon, ma'am.
Afternoon, sir.

16:39.820 --> 16:40.980
My name's Walt.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.460
I'm here to help you any way
I can during your visit...

16:43.540 --> 16:44.660
be it short or long...

16:44.700 --> 16:46.500
and whether it is purely
for refueling purposes...

16:46.580 --> 16:49.420
or for the use of our extensive
washroom and retail facilities.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.060
- Is this a gas station, Walt?
- It sure is, sir.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.340
Then fill it up with gas
and cut the crap.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.780
The guy was just doing his job.

17:01.780 --> 17:05.180
You know, he was just trying
to be helpful.

17:07.180 --> 17:08.980
You're in a lot of trouble,
you know?

17:10.780 --> 17:13.020
My father's
gonna have you killed.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.619
Do you realize that?

17:16.700 --> 17:18.579
Tortured first, naturally.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.859
Then he's gonna have you killed.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.300
And what if I let you go?

17:26.819 --> 17:28.260
I don't know. What do you think?

17:30.220 --> 17:32.180
Think he's just gonna
forgive you?

17:32.220 --> 17:33.900
Wait a minute.

17:33.980 --> 17:35.860
Why would I ask him
to forgive me?

17:35.900 --> 17:38.620
Your father treated me
like a piece of shit...

17:38.660 --> 17:40.020
like I was nobody...

17:40.060 --> 17:42.540
just because I was a cleaner...
like I was disposable.

17:43.820 --> 17:44.980
Ahem.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.500
Well, that's the tank full, sir.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.740
Thank you, Walt.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.220
That's for you, Walt.

18:02.220 --> 18:03.580
You're a man, Walt.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.820
Not a slave, not a machine.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.500
Don't let anyone
ever treat you otherwise.

18:10.540 --> 18:12.620
Go on.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.460
It's empty.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.180
Let's get this clear.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.140
I'm not gonna hurt you...

18:53.220 --> 18:55.100
but I am the kidnapper,
and you are the...

18:55.180 --> 18:56.260
Victim.

18:56.340 --> 18:57.620
That's just the way it is.

18:57.660 --> 19:00.180
It's OK.
I've been through this before.

19:01.860 --> 19:03.060
Kidnapped before?

19:03.100 --> 19:04.180
Yeah. I was twelve.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.860
- God, that's terrible.
- It was a long time ago.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.500
So... so how am I doing?

19:15.580 --> 19:17.500
In the kidnap?

19:17.580 --> 19:18.660
Yeah.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.860
So far,
you're not doing too bad.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.180
Thank you.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.980
Anyway, I'm just tying you up so
you can't escape in the night.

19:28.060 --> 19:29.100
I know that.

19:29.180 --> 19:30.460
Because, of course, you would.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.380
Are you gonna try
to have sex with me?

19:32.420 --> 19:33.860
No.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.900
Isn't that what
you brought me up here for?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.340
No, it's not.

19:38.420 --> 19:39.940
It didn't even cross your mind?

19:40.020 --> 19:42.340
No. Well... No.

19:42.420 --> 19:43.980
Do you have a problem with sex?

19:44.060 --> 19:45.460
No.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.140
So you're just frightened of it?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.260
No.

19:48.340 --> 19:50.580
- Nervous, then?
- I'm not nervous.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.340
- Then calm down.
- I'm perfectly calm.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.220
I'm just trying to explain...

19:54.300 --> 19:56.380
that there's no sexual motives
for my actions.

19:57.900 --> 19:58.980
I'm glad we got that cleared up.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.900
So, what did they do next?

20:14.260 --> 20:16.180
They put a needle in my arm
and took a pint of blood...

20:16.220 --> 20:18.140
and sent it to my father.

20:20.700 --> 20:21.860
The next week
they did the same...

20:21.940 --> 20:23.980
and the same the next week
till he paid up.

20:24.060 --> 20:26.620
He waited six weeks.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.740
That's what happens
to the victim.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.500
Around our way

20:40.540 --> 20:43.980
The sun shines bright

20:44.980 --> 20:47.020
Around our way

20:47.100 --> 20:50.220
The birds sing for ya

20:50.300 --> 20:53.340
'Cause they already know ya

21:08.900 --> 21:10.260
Enjoying the book?

21:10.300 --> 21:11.580
No.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.780
What's it about?

21:13.820 --> 21:15.460
It's a romance.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.220
This girl meets this guy.

21:17.300 --> 21:18.660
They fall in love.

21:18.740 --> 21:19.860
It's bullshit.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.980
I'm writing a novel myself.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.140
A lot of people say that,
but in my case, it's true.

21:24.220 --> 21:25.300
I'm not interested...

21:25.380 --> 21:27.220
in you or your novel...

21:27.260 --> 21:29.100
or any other pathetic ambition
you have...

21:29.180 --> 21:32.420
to change your miserable,
mundane existence.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.300
Do you want some exercise?

21:37.340 --> 21:38.420
No.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.180
You can't say no. It's
not part of the arrangement.

21:40.220 --> 21:42.460
- I want to read my book.
- You said it was bullshit.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.700
Doesn't mean
I'm not enjoying it.

21:43.740 --> 21:46.620
- You just said you weren't!
- A girl can change her mind.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.580
" She heard
his breathing become shallow...

21:55.660 --> 21:58.420
"and a flicker of a smile
chased across her lips...

21:58.460 --> 22:02.660
"as she meditated on the power
she now held over him.

22:02.740 --> 22:05.260
"'Are you sure you want
to catch that flight? '

22:05.340 --> 22:06.620
"she asked."

22:06.740 --> 22:08.980
Do you think
they're in love yet?

22:09.020 --> 22:11.420
No.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.340
If they are in love,
we can go home.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.620
Tonight, you're mine

22:16.700 --> 22:18.700
I hate it down here.

22:18.780 --> 22:21.500
I hate the air
and I hate the food...

22:21.580 --> 22:22.980
and I hate the plumbing.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.060
" She pulled him
closer, unable to stop."

22:25.140 --> 22:27.220
I ache... all over.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.340
"This, indeed,
was perfect love."

22:28.420 --> 22:30.820
I sweat in the heat
and ache in the cold.

22:35.740 --> 22:38.020
But will you love me tomorrow?

22:38.100 --> 22:40.460
Why can't we stay
someplace decent?

22:41.620 --> 22:43.180
Budget doesn't cover that.

22:43.260 --> 22:46.380
Exactly. Why not?

22:47.260 --> 22:50.940
You know those mysterious ways
you keep hearing about, Jackson?

22:53.060 --> 22:55.060
Well, this is one of them.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.980
"...cold, gloating gaze,
she let her hand droop down...

22:58.020 --> 22:59.540
"towards the bulge
of his passion."

22:59.620 --> 23:01.420
I remember the good old days.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.380
" She heard
his breathing become shallow."

23:03.420 --> 23:06.860
All you had to do
was introduce a man and a woman.

23:06.940 --> 23:08.020
Nature did the rest.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.140
"She gasped..."

23:09.220 --> 23:10.260
Aah! Fuck!

23:10.340 --> 23:12.060
"with surprise and delight."

23:12.100 --> 23:13.820
Doesn't work like that anymore.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.700
" All of her soul
erupted between her thighs...

23:16.740 --> 23:18.740
"as she sensed the firm,
exploratory pressure...

23:18.780 --> 23:19.860
"of his warm flesh."

23:19.940 --> 23:21.940
Men and women...
it's all gone to shit.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.300
Sure has.

23:23.380 --> 23:25.260
"In the hidden recess
of her pelvis...

23:25.340 --> 23:27.540
"their bodies fused
into one writhing mass...

23:27.580 --> 23:29.420
of torrid, torrid sexual..."

23:29.500 --> 23:30.980
When the night

23:31.060 --> 23:33.420
Meets the morning sun

23:36.540 --> 23:39.060
I'd like to know

23:39.140 --> 23:42.060
That your love

23:43.460 --> 23:45.940
Is a love I can

23:46.020 --> 23:49.340
Be sure of

23:49.420 --> 23:52.260
So tell me now

23:52.340 --> 23:53.380
Mmm.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.300
And I won't ask again

23:55.380 --> 23:57.180
Mmm.

23:57.220 --> 23:59.700
Will you still love me tomorrow?

23:59.740 --> 24:00.820
Mmm.

24:00.860 --> 24:03.100
Aren't you hungry?

24:04.980 --> 24:06.860
I don't eat red meat.

24:09.260 --> 24:11.140
Well, you could eat
the vegetables.

24:12.340 --> 24:14.020
They're on the same plate.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.900
So?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.620
I'm not gonna eat this.

24:21.340 --> 24:24.340
Do you eat fish and poultry?

24:24.380 --> 24:25.620
Yes.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.300
But not red meat?

24:27.380 --> 24:30.500
No. Or eggs, unless I know
they're free-range.

24:30.580 --> 24:32.420
Then why didn't you tell me
you don't like meat?

24:32.500 --> 24:34.100
Because you didn't ask!

24:34.140 --> 24:36.620
And I do like meat.
I just don't eat it.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.060
Moral reasons, if you must know.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.620
If you had taken the time
to inquire...

24:39.700 --> 24:41.540
Why are you such a pain
to be with?

24:41.620 --> 24:44.220
Because you tied me to a chair
all night!

24:44.300 --> 24:45.900
Because I am the victim...

24:45.980 --> 24:47.660
and you are the kidnapper,
apparently!

24:47.740 --> 24:49.780
Meaning exactly what?

24:49.820 --> 24:52.220
"Kidnap For Beginners"...
chapter one...

24:52.260 --> 24:54.500
have you even asked
for a ransom yet?

25:03.340 --> 25:04.620
Don't say a word
until I tell you.

25:08.460 --> 25:09.820
Hello. Mr. Naville?

25:09.900 --> 25:11.260
lt... it's me.

25:11.340 --> 25:12.700
Now, I want my...

25:12.780 --> 25:14.220
Me.

25:14.300 --> 25:16.300
The kidnapper!

25:16.380 --> 25:19.540
Right. Now, what I want...

25:19.580 --> 25:22.100
It's not like that.

25:22.140 --> 25:24.300
That's unfair now. I would not...

25:25.660 --> 25:27.020
What are you doing?

25:27.100 --> 25:28.940
No, what are you doing?

25:29.020 --> 25:30.220
I'm negotiating
with your father.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.460
- Did you get very far?
- Well, he kept interrupting.

25:32.540 --> 25:34.380
- Right.
- Wouldn't let me finish.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.980
Remember
what they didn't teach you...

25:36.060 --> 25:37.380
at Harvard Business School, OK?

25:37.460 --> 25:40.020
I didn't go
to Harvard Business School.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.180
It's a figure of speech, Robert.

25:42.260 --> 25:43.500
Oh.

25:43.580 --> 25:44.620
Sorry.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.940
Negotiation is a weakness.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.380
You are the kidnapper.

25:48.420 --> 25:50.620
You demand, and he complies.

25:50.700 --> 25:53.300
You go in hard,
and you go in fast.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.580
- Hard and fast.
- Right.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.020
I'm you.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.340
You grasp that?

25:59.260 --> 26:00.340
OK.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.180
Pretend it's ringing.
You psych yourself up.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.540
Go to your dark side.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.380
OK. He answers.

26:10.540 --> 26:13.180
All right, you motherfucker,
I've got your daughter here.

26:13.260 --> 26:15.860
I'm sending her back in pieces
if I don't get what I want.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.220
I'm gonna pull her fingers out
with pliers...

26:18.300 --> 26:20.900
and then I'm gonna fry them up
for breakfast, understand?

26:22.380 --> 26:24.220
And so on and so on
like that, OK?

26:24.300 --> 26:27.620
For no longer than
thirty seconds.

26:28.940 --> 26:31.020
What?

26:39.180 --> 26:40.740
Hello there. Mr. Naville?
Now...

26:47.860 --> 26:49.620
Right, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here...

26:49.660 --> 26:52.020
and I'm gonna cut her up...

26:52.060 --> 26:54.580
and post her home to you
in boxes! Small boxes!

27:02.140 --> 27:03.940
Right, daughter,
I've got your asshole here...

27:04.020 --> 27:05.260
and I'm gonna send...

27:06.620 --> 27:08.100
Right! Right!

27:10.940 --> 27:13.180
No, I can't speak to anyone!
I need to speak to him!

27:13.220 --> 27:14.380
Hello?

27:14.460 --> 27:16.180
Yeah, I can hold.

27:16.220 --> 27:18.900
Right, listen, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here...

27:18.940 --> 27:20.940
and I'm gonna send her back
in pieces unless...

27:21.020 --> 27:22.260
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.220
No, I must've dialed
the wrong number.

27:24.260 --> 27:26.100
No, I haven't got
your daughter here.

27:26.140 --> 27:27.460
I have someone else's.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.340
No, we're not married.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.380
Yes, I've read the same thing.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.540
It's very hard to find
suitable young men these days.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.780
Well, I'm sure
your daughter's very nice.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.900
In principle, I've got
no objections to meeting her...

27:40.500 --> 27:41.820
What is the problem?

27:41.860 --> 27:44.420
I think you should
just send a letter.

27:48.020 --> 27:49.740
Done this kind of work before?

27:49.820 --> 27:51.180
We do everything.

27:51.260 --> 27:54.060
Eviction and debt collection
are our daily bread...

27:54.140 --> 27:56.300
but personal retrieval,
bounty hunting...

27:56.380 --> 27:57.940
you name it, we do it.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.060
How much?

27:59.100 --> 28:02.980
Our fee for the recovery
of your daughter is...

28:03.060 --> 28:05.860
one hundred thousand dollars.

28:05.940 --> 28:07.380
That's a lot of money.

28:07.460 --> 28:10.060
Five thousand advance.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.420
The rest is cash on delivery.
No daughter, no dough.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.340
Naturally,
we operate a sliding scale...

28:14.420 --> 28:16.140
whereby if we only bring back
part of your daughter...

28:16.220 --> 28:17.260
we only get part of the money.

28:17.340 --> 28:18.380
That's enough, Jackson.

28:18.460 --> 28:21.660
If he's cut her ears off,
and we can't find them...

28:21.700 --> 28:23.060
we'll knock a couple thousand
off the tariff.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.580
More for a limb, obviously.

28:24.660 --> 28:25.900
Jackson.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.020
Sorry.

28:27.100 --> 28:30.340
Mr. Naville,
I don't think you need to worry.

28:30.420 --> 28:33.300
My partner is simply envisaging
a worst-case scenario.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.860
What about the kidnapper?

28:35.900 --> 28:37.540
You want him, too?

28:37.620 --> 28:39.220
That's extra.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.740
What if he gets in the way?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.980
We'll deal with that situation
if it arises.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.980
What if I want him
to get in the way?

28:45.980 --> 28:48.140
Let us speak plainly,
Mr. Naville.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.380
You want we should kill him?

28:51.460 --> 28:52.900
Yes.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.020
Uh...

29:04.180 --> 29:05.380
Sir, I must say...

29:05.460 --> 29:07.220
No one's asking you, Mayhew.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.460
Very good, sir.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.420
I am not gonna kill anyone.

29:12.380 --> 29:15.500
If we don't get this job,
someone else will.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.620
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- Including expenses?

29:28.700 --> 29:30.660
Including all expenses...

29:30.740 --> 29:32.260
except medical costs...

29:32.340 --> 29:35.780
for which you accept full
and unlimited responsibility.

29:35.860 --> 29:37.620
Only for the duration
of the contract.

29:37.660 --> 29:39.580
- Naturally.
- It's a deal.

30:08.380 --> 30:09.660
Good afternoon.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.580
Hi.

30:11.620 --> 30:15.420
I'm Tod Johnson.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.100
I live up the hill.

30:18.180 --> 30:19.380
That's nice.

30:19.460 --> 30:22.220
I see most things from up there.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.820
Saw you arrive.

30:26.180 --> 30:29.140
Big car, middle of the night.

30:29.180 --> 30:30.260
Right.

30:30.340 --> 30:32.340
Wondered "Who's that?"

30:33.660 --> 30:35.500
Perfectly natural question.

30:35.580 --> 30:36.940
So I asked Felix.

30:37.020 --> 30:38.060
Felix?

30:38.140 --> 30:39.380
Felix is my friend.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.460
He hasn't been the same
since the war.

30:42.780 --> 30:44.020
Of course.

30:44.060 --> 30:46.540
I asked him.
I said, " Felix, tell me...

30:46.620 --> 30:48.460
"are they good,
or are they evil?"

30:48.540 --> 30:50.220
One bark for good, two for evil.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.980
Felix is a dog?

30:54.140 --> 30:57.100
Do you think
that I would talk to a dog?

30:57.180 --> 30:59.180
Do you think
I would ask a dog...

30:59.260 --> 31:00.900
whether or not
you're good or evil?

31:00.980 --> 31:03.300
What do you think I am...

31:03.380 --> 31:06.180
some kind
of a crazy backwoods lunatic...

31:06.260 --> 31:08.140
with a barn
full of human skulls...

31:08.220 --> 31:09.900
and a scythe
that I sharpen every day...

31:09.980 --> 31:11.500
in readiness for Armageddon?

31:11.580 --> 31:13.620
No.
I'm sure you're a regular guy.

31:13.660 --> 31:16.780
Right! I'm regular!
I am a regular man.

31:16.860 --> 31:18.700
I want...

31:18.780 --> 31:21.580
That's not the point!
The point is, who are you?!

31:21.660 --> 31:22.820
Who are you?!

31:24.060 --> 31:25.780
Well, I'm...

31:26.780 --> 31:28.820
We're newlyweds.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.980
Are you coming back to bed
soon, darling?

31:36.260 --> 31:38.340
This is Mr. Johnson, dear.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.820
Hello.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.900
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

31:44.980 --> 31:46.700
You can call me Lucille.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.740
My pleasure, Lucille.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.140
You're not
from the newspapers, are you?

31:54.220 --> 31:55.380
I live up the hill.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.980
Oh, good. You can't tell
the newspapers we're here.

31:58.060 --> 32:00.860
They never leave us alone,
on account of Ritchie.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.340
Ritchie?

32:03.140 --> 32:05.620
You recognize Ritchie,
don't you?

32:05.700 --> 32:07.220
Ritchie Vanderlow?

32:07.300 --> 32:09.300
Six gold albums...

32:09.380 --> 32:10.300
three platinum.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.860
Fourteen consecutive
top-ten singles.

32:12.940 --> 32:15.020
Largest-selling artist
worldwide...

32:15.100 --> 32:16.380
for the last twelve months?

32:16.420 --> 32:18.140
Ritchie Vanderlow!

32:18.220 --> 32:20.540
You have got to understand,
ma'am...

32:20.620 --> 32:23.540
I watch mainly
the biblical channels.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.340
It's OK.

32:25.420 --> 32:27.260
We were married in secret...

32:27.340 --> 32:28.820
in a castle in Scotland.

32:28.860 --> 32:30.060
That's in England.

32:30.140 --> 32:31.700
Near Paris?

32:32.700 --> 32:33.860
Paris.

32:33.940 --> 32:35.380
Right.

32:35.420 --> 32:37.180
It was so romantic.

32:38.140 --> 32:39.380
We stayed there
for our honeymoon...

32:39.420 --> 32:40.500
but it wasn't long enough...

32:40.540 --> 32:44.140
so we came here for the sake
of a little privacy.

32:44.220 --> 32:45.980
Mmm. I see.

32:47.140 --> 32:49.140
Would you like to come in...

32:49.180 --> 32:50.340
Mr. Johnson?

32:58.140 --> 32:59.700
No, I better be on my way.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.780
I have to feed Felix.

33:01.820 --> 33:03.380
OK.

33:03.420 --> 33:04.860
Well...

33:04.900 --> 33:08.020
it was a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Johnson.

33:08.060 --> 33:09.980
See you around.

33:17.940 --> 33:20.340
I'll catch you later then,
Mr. Johnson.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.220
Take care, Ritchie.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.100
Thanks.

33:42.460 --> 33:43.540
This?

33:43.620 --> 33:45.020
The ransom note.

33:45.060 --> 33:47.180
- Right. Anonymous.
- Yeah.

33:47.260 --> 33:48.900
Robert...

33:48.980 --> 33:50.580
my father knows who you are.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.140
Oh, I never thought of that.

33:53.180 --> 33:54.980
You are the worst kidnapper
I've ever met.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.580
Oh, and that's all I am
to you, isn't it?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.020
The latest kidnapper!

33:58.100 --> 33:59.700
A lifestyle accessory.

33:59.780 --> 34:01.220
And if it doesn't work,
it doesn't matter...

34:01.300 --> 34:02.900
'cause you can always
get another one.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.260
Quit being so melodramatic.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.020
I'm trying to do my best here...

34:06.100 --> 34:07.620
under really difficult
circumstances!

34:07.700 --> 34:09.380
It's not made any easier...

34:09.460 --> 34:11.620
by you criticizing
everything I do!

34:16.179 --> 34:18.420
- How much you asking for?
- Half a million.

34:18.460 --> 34:20.179
- Dollars?
- Yes.

34:20.219 --> 34:22.139
- U.S. Dollars?
- Is there a problem?

34:22.219 --> 34:25.580
Half a million dollars
isn't a lot of money for me!

34:25.659 --> 34:28.139
It's not meant
to reflect you as an individual.

34:28.219 --> 34:31.420
If word got out I was liberated
for half a million...

34:31.460 --> 34:34.500
I could never show my face
in polite society again.

34:34.580 --> 34:37.100
Diamonds have no value except
that which is placed upon them.

34:37.179 --> 34:39.219
It's more complicated
than I thought!

34:39.260 --> 34:41.020
OK, don't worry...

34:41.060 --> 34:42.460
all right?

34:42.500 --> 34:44.179
You're trying hard.

34:44.219 --> 34:46.580
You're keen to learn.
That's important.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.659
Let's just not
lose sight of the fact...

34:48.739 --> 34:50.139
that we have the opportunity...

34:50.179 --> 34:51.980
to make
millions of dollars here.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.340
We?

34:56.420 --> 34:58.300
Yes, Robert.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.620
You and me.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.660
Is that not a little irregular?

35:05.380 --> 35:06.940
Yes, it is.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.340
Millions?

35:12.420 --> 35:14.620
Please, dad,
just give him the money!

35:14.660 --> 35:16.540
He's gonna kill me, daddy!

35:16.580 --> 35:19.540
Please! Just put it
in the trunk of the car...

35:19.620 --> 35:22.220
two miles south of Palmer,
please, daddy!

35:22.300 --> 35:23.380
Daddy!

35:41.500 --> 35:43.380
OK, OK, OK.

35:44.540 --> 35:45.620
OK, OK.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.900
Nice shooting.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.420
Thanks.

38:57.020 --> 38:58.260
Shit.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.100
Aah!

39:59.580 --> 40:00.660
No problem.

40:00.700 --> 40:02.340
Exactly as you predicted.

40:02.420 --> 40:04.940
"Quick, drive my car."

40:06.780 --> 40:08.940
Here's forty dollars.

40:10.020 --> 40:12.540
If you don't mind me asking...

40:12.620 --> 40:14.100
how did you know
he'd react like that?

40:14.180 --> 40:15.780
It's our job
to know things like that.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.660
You done
this sort of thing before?

40:17.700 --> 40:19.220
Let's go!

40:19.260 --> 40:22.700
You can take the car,
but remember, it's stolen.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.540
Look,
they weren't trying to kill you.

40:31.580 --> 40:33.500
They were trying to confuse you
and scare you.

40:33.540 --> 40:35.340
Yeah, before they killed me.

40:35.420 --> 40:38.260
And I lost the car,
and I didn't get any money.

40:38.340 --> 40:40.660
You can't expect to get
everything right the first time.

40:40.700 --> 40:43.060
Look, you are going to be fine.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.980
You are going to be...

40:46.020 --> 40:47.420
a success.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.020
Do you think so?

40:50.100 --> 40:52.020
You didn't get caught, right?

40:52.100 --> 40:53.580
No.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.540
No, I didn't get caught.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.020
I fooled them.

40:57.060 --> 40:58.460
I got away.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.020
Maybe we should go out.

41:02.180 --> 41:03.300
Out where?

41:03.380 --> 41:05.300
For a drink.

41:07.100 --> 41:08.260
What, like on a date?

41:08.340 --> 41:10.420
Yeah, like a date.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.620
I wouldn't call it
a bad relationship.

41:16.700 --> 41:19.380
No, Lily and I, we just...

41:19.420 --> 41:21.460
You know,
we just grew apart as people.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.900
There was no bitterness
on either side.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.020
She left you?

41:26.300 --> 41:28.180
No, no, no, no. No!

41:29.300 --> 41:31.500
Yes, she left me.

41:31.580 --> 41:32.940
Mmm.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.660
The aerobics instructor.

41:36.220 --> 41:37.620
How did you know?

41:37.660 --> 41:38.740
You have the demeanor...

41:38.820 --> 41:41.100
of a man who's been left
for an aerobics instructor.

41:41.180 --> 41:42.540
- I do?
- Yeah.

41:42.620 --> 41:45.420
But be honest.
It was inevitable.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.340
You two weren't suited
for one another.

41:47.420 --> 41:49.340
You dream of something better.
She wants it now.

41:49.420 --> 41:51.980
Hence, the gymnast.
Am I right?

41:52.060 --> 41:53.100
Well, yeah.

41:53.180 --> 41:55.060
Yeah. It's a common scenario.

41:57.020 --> 41:59.980
Can I tell you about
this dream I have? You're in it.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.140
I'm in your dream?

42:03.100 --> 42:04.420
Now I feel violated.

42:04.500 --> 42:07.420
- Oh, it's not like that.
- I don't wanna hear it.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.340
Perhaps this is
a good opportunity...

42:09.420 --> 42:10.900
to tell you about my novel.

42:10.940 --> 42:13.500
Look, I'm not interested
in your novel.

42:13.580 --> 42:14.940
It's 1962, right?

42:15.020 --> 42:16.500
And Marilyn Monroe...

42:16.580 --> 42:18.780
is giving birth to a baby girl.

42:18.820 --> 42:20.380
She's on the phone
to Jack Kennedy...

42:20.460 --> 42:22.100
saying, " Jack, it's yours.
It's yours, Jack."

42:22.180 --> 42:23.740
So the orphan grows up...

42:23.820 --> 42:25.660
And she solves
some great mystery, right?

42:25.700 --> 42:28.500
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.780
Let's play a game.

42:38.220 --> 42:40.100
If I win...

42:41.180 --> 42:42.260
I go free.

42:42.300 --> 42:45.140
Look, you are free.
The kidnap's over.

42:45.180 --> 42:47.580
You're more a kidnapper
than I am Ritchie Vanderlow.

42:47.620 --> 42:49.860
Indulge me, Robert.

42:49.940 --> 42:52.020
Well, if it's what you want.

42:52.060 --> 42:53.540
It's all I ever want.

42:57.580 --> 42:58.820
OK.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.100
You're free.

43:18.140 --> 43:19.420
That's right.

43:21.340 --> 43:22.900
Aren't you gonna leave?

43:24.700 --> 43:27.340
We haven't got our money yet.

43:29.860 --> 43:32.220
Don't take your love to town

43:35.100 --> 43:39.140
Oh, Ruby

43:39.220 --> 43:41.140
For God's sakes, turn around

43:42.140 --> 43:44.340
Big hand! Big hand!

43:44.380 --> 43:47.220
Big hand for local boy
Scottie Sherman.

43:49.980 --> 43:52.300
We are privileged
to have here tonight...

43:52.380 --> 43:53.940
a very special guest...

43:53.980 --> 43:56.580
who is a close personal friend
of mine...

43:56.660 --> 43:59.780
and I'm gonna ask him
to come up here and sing a song.

43:59.860 --> 44:03.140
He is the best-selling artist
in the world...

44:03.220 --> 44:05.260
with twelve gold albums...

44:05.340 --> 44:07.860
sixteen platinum albums...

44:07.900 --> 44:11.060
and thirty-two
number-one hit singles!

44:11.100 --> 44:15.460
Mr. Ritchie Vanderclaw!

44:44.140 --> 44:45.180
Thank you very much.

44:45.260 --> 44:48.100
My name is Rob...
Ritchie Vanderlow...

44:48.180 --> 44:50.060
and, um...

44:51.380 --> 44:54.340
I'd like to sing this song
for my beautiful wife...

44:54.420 --> 44:55.740
Aww.

44:55.820 --> 44:56.820
Lucille.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.620
Uh...

44:59.780 --> 45:02.860
Oh, and this is
a very special song for us.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.060
Somewhere

45:12.100 --> 45:14.580
Beyond the sea

45:14.660 --> 45:15.860
Somewhere

45:15.940 --> 45:18.780
Waiting for me

45:18.820 --> 45:20.700
My lover stands

45:20.740 --> 45:23.580
On golden sands

45:23.620 --> 45:25.620
And watches the ships

45:25.700 --> 45:29.340
That go sailing

45:29.380 --> 45:32.220
Somewhere

45:32.260 --> 45:34.260
Beyond the sea

45:34.340 --> 45:35.540
She's there

45:35.620 --> 45:38.740
Watching for me

45:38.820 --> 45:40.460
And if I could fly

45:40.540 --> 45:43.500
Like birds on high

45:43.580 --> 45:45.620
Then straight to her arms

45:45.700 --> 45:49.140
I'd go sailing

45:49.220 --> 45:51.380
It's far

45:51.460 --> 45:53.740
Beyond the stars

45:53.820 --> 45:55.500
It's near

45:55.580 --> 45:57.940
Beyond the moon

45:59.220 --> 46:02.060
I know

46:02.140 --> 46:03.820
Beyond a doubt

46:03.900 --> 46:05.740
My heart

46:05.820 --> 46:07.420
Will lead me there

46:07.500 --> 46:08.940
Soon

46:09.020 --> 46:10.580
We'll meet

46:11.900 --> 46:14.060
Beyond the shore

46:14.140 --> 46:15.340
We'll kiss

46:15.420 --> 46:18.220
Just like before

46:18.300 --> 46:20.140
And happy we'll be

46:20.220 --> 46:23.100
Beyond the sea

46:23.180 --> 46:25.100
And never again

46:25.180 --> 46:28.580
I'll go sailing

46:58.540 --> 47:00.980
I know

47:00.980 --> 47:01.660
I know

47:01.740 --> 47:03.660
Beyond a doubt

47:03.740 --> 47:05.180
My heart

47:05.260 --> 47:07.100
Will lead me there

47:07.180 --> 47:08.700
Soon

47:08.780 --> 47:10.340
We'll meet

47:14.180 --> 47:16.580
Touches my heart
to see two young people in love.

47:18.220 --> 47:19.700
Happy we'll be

47:19.780 --> 47:22.740
Beyond the sea

47:22.820 --> 47:24.740
And never again

47:24.820 --> 47:28.540
I'll go sailing

47:48.020 --> 47:49.380
Hmm.

47:54.820 --> 47:57.420
Oh, my God. What happened?

47:57.500 --> 47:59.740
You were great.

48:01.260 --> 48:02.580
I was?

48:02.620 --> 48:03.700
Mm-hmm.

48:11.020 --> 48:12.780
I remember drinking tequila.

48:12.860 --> 48:15.380
Certainly was a feature
of the evening.

48:16.780 --> 48:19.140
Then I had
an incredible dream.

48:20.620 --> 48:22.100
This dream, I've had it before.

48:22.140 --> 48:23.900
You're definitely in it now.

48:23.980 --> 48:25.580
I don't want to hear it.

48:25.660 --> 48:28.940
We were on this
game show called Perfect Love.

48:29.020 --> 48:30.620
Never heard of it.

48:30.700 --> 48:32.060
Well, it's just a dream.

48:32.100 --> 48:34.100
I don't think the fact
that it's a game show...

48:34.180 --> 48:35.380
has any relevance.

48:35.420 --> 48:37.820
It merely indicates
my cultural origins.

48:37.900 --> 48:41.180
I mean, were I a tribesman
in the Kalahari, for instance...

48:41.260 --> 48:44.540
the location would undoubtedly
have been different.

48:44.620 --> 48:46.740
But I think
the theme is universal.

48:46.780 --> 48:49.260
We're on this game show
called Perfect Love.

48:49.340 --> 48:51.660
My life was in danger.

48:51.740 --> 48:53.100
Are you ready?

48:53.180 --> 48:55.020
Am I ready for what?

48:55.100 --> 48:56.500
To write a letter.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.940
Perhaps you'd like to keep this.

49:05.020 --> 49:06.380
We had it analyzed.

49:06.460 --> 49:08.500
It's his handwriting
and her blood.

49:08.580 --> 49:10.260
Without our help,
Mr. Naville...

49:10.300 --> 49:11.860
that could be the last trace
of your daughter you ever see.

49:11.940 --> 49:15.260
He wants a straight
switch with no delays.

49:19.580 --> 49:21.780
- I want her back.
- Don't worry. We'll get her.

49:21.820 --> 49:22.900
And I want him dead.

49:22.940 --> 49:24.300
That's understood, Mr. Naville.

49:24.380 --> 49:25.740
Good.

49:27.740 --> 49:31.500
And when this is over,
I want this back.

49:37.660 --> 49:39.500
Bradley was nice, you know?

49:39.580 --> 49:41.460
Extremely wealthy.

49:43.100 --> 49:45.620
Honorable, amusing.

49:45.660 --> 49:47.540
And?

49:47.580 --> 49:49.940
Well, eighty-seven years old.

49:49.980 --> 49:52.260
- Ha ha. Pity.
- Yeah.

49:52.340 --> 49:53.700
Then there was Jake.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.140
He was nice.

49:55.220 --> 49:56.900
Very rich.

49:56.980 --> 49:58.500
Just so conventional.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.340
You see?
Rich guys. Conventional.

50:00.380 --> 50:01.460
It's a problem.

50:01.500 --> 50:03.780
Then there was Angelo.

50:04.900 --> 50:06.420
Twenty-five years old...

50:06.500 --> 50:07.940
handsome, healthy...

50:08.020 --> 50:09.700
exciting...

50:09.780 --> 50:11.620
sophisticated.

50:11.700 --> 50:12.780
Considerate.

50:18.380 --> 50:19.460
So?

50:21.620 --> 50:23.420
Well, I think
that we just sort of, um...

50:24.980 --> 50:27.060
grew apart as people.

50:31.300 --> 50:33.260
The aerobics instructor?

50:36.620 --> 50:38.660
Like I said...

50:38.740 --> 50:41.060
it's a common scenario.

50:44.260 --> 50:45.700
So who was next?

50:45.780 --> 50:48.780
Then I started getting
problems with my teeth.

50:48.860 --> 50:50.420
With your teeth?

50:50.500 --> 50:52.340
Yeah, my teeth.

50:54.340 --> 50:55.460
Hey, want a ride?

50:55.540 --> 50:57.340
Hi, thanks for stopping, guys.

50:57.380 --> 51:00.100
Uh, we're not stealing it,
we're just borrowing it.

51:00.180 --> 51:01.980
Had that dream again last night.

51:02.020 --> 51:03.700
What dream?

51:03.780 --> 51:05.940
We were
on that game show Perfect Love.

51:06.020 --> 51:08.380
- Mmm. Fascinating.
- And my life was in danger.

51:08.420 --> 51:09.460
On a game show?

51:09.540 --> 51:11.220
I know.
It's difficult to explain.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.700
Strange things were happening.

51:12.740 --> 51:14.620
Mmm. So it would appear.

51:14.660 --> 51:16.540
But my life was in danger...

51:16.580 --> 51:18.460
and you saved it.

51:18.500 --> 51:20.860
My heart was beating so fast...

51:20.900 --> 51:22.420
and then it stopped.

51:22.500 --> 51:24.660
And I was just about to die...

51:24.740 --> 51:26.140
and you saved it.

51:26.180 --> 51:28.060
You saved my life.

51:28.100 --> 51:29.980
Well, what are we waiting for?

51:32.020 --> 51:34.740
You want to get on with this
or not?

51:34.780 --> 51:36.300
Sure!

51:36.380 --> 51:38.540
You send the girl over.

51:38.620 --> 51:40.740
Ha ha. First the money.
That was the deal.

51:42.780 --> 51:44.580
Are you OK, Miss Naville?

51:44.660 --> 51:46.380
Yes, I'm OK.

51:46.460 --> 51:48.900
I'm just a little frightened.

52:07.900 --> 52:09.660
Now, don't you worry, miss.

52:09.700 --> 52:12.140
Everything'll be all right.

52:24.500 --> 52:25.620
Well?

52:25.660 --> 52:28.260
Whew. It's here.

52:28.340 --> 52:31.820
OK? Send the girl over.

52:33.180 --> 52:34.700
OK, go on.

52:34.780 --> 52:36.020
Ohh, damn.

52:36.980 --> 52:39.060
Aah! Aah!

52:39.140 --> 52:40.340
Aah! Aah! Help!

52:40.420 --> 52:41.740
Get down! Get down!

52:42.780 --> 52:44.220
Yes.

52:44.300 --> 52:46.420
They tied me up! Ohh!

52:46.500 --> 52:48.500
Ha ha!

53:28.020 --> 53:29.740
Don't move a fucking muscle.

53:32.020 --> 53:33.700
Mmm.

53:34.940 --> 53:36.100
What took you?

53:36.180 --> 53:38.660
He shot up the car!

53:40.580 --> 53:43.460
You shot up our car.

53:43.540 --> 53:45.980
Now, what did you do that for?

53:46.060 --> 53:49.140
I was trying to make a getaway.

53:51.900 --> 53:53.420
You were trying
to make a getaway?

54:05.980 --> 54:07.980
How is she?

54:08.060 --> 54:09.460
I don't know.

54:13.380 --> 54:14.700
But I don't think it's worked.

54:15.820 --> 54:17.660
They're not... you know?

54:17.740 --> 54:19.340
Jeopardy.
Jeopardy, Jackson...

54:20.780 --> 54:22.780
always works.

54:42.580 --> 54:43.660
OK.

54:45.940 --> 54:47.820
This is far enough.

54:52.820 --> 54:55.300
Are you... are you going
to kill me?

54:55.380 --> 54:56.420
Yeah.

54:58.620 --> 55:00.500
Well, then I don't see
why I should dig.

55:02.180 --> 55:03.580
If you dig...

55:04.860 --> 55:06.020
I promise you
when the time comes...

55:06.100 --> 55:07.180
I'll shoot you through the head.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.100
Now, look, you don't like that?

55:10.180 --> 55:11.580
I can just shoot you through
the testicles right now.

55:11.660 --> 55:12.980
You can bleed to death.
I'll dig the grave.

55:13.020 --> 55:15.700
It's up to you.

55:30.580 --> 55:31.900
Can you cut me free?

55:33.180 --> 55:34.860
Please?

55:35.860 --> 55:37.260
It's sore.

55:40.860 --> 55:43.140
What's he going to do with him?

55:43.220 --> 55:45.300
Shoot him in the back
of the head.

55:49.340 --> 55:50.420
Right.

55:52.060 --> 55:54.740
Would that be a problem for you?

55:57.820 --> 56:01.660
Ever felt like
you're not in control of events?

56:01.740 --> 56:02.860
Yes.

56:04.700 --> 56:06.060
No, I mean...

56:06.140 --> 56:08.740
something is...

56:08.820 --> 56:10.420
destined to happen...

56:10.500 --> 56:11.580
and it doesn't?

56:13.020 --> 56:16.500
Like, what happens
when the forces of destiny...

56:16.540 --> 56:17.900
are no longer in control?

56:21.020 --> 56:22.140
I don't know.

56:24.420 --> 56:26.100
The truth is...

56:26.140 --> 56:29.940
I don't think even he knows
what's going on down here...

56:29.980 --> 56:32.060
the chaos, the...

56:32.140 --> 56:35.340
This hatred, this violence.

56:35.420 --> 56:36.500
Who...

56:37.980 --> 56:39.220
Who are you talking about?

56:42.940 --> 56:44.260
Jeopardy, Jackson...

56:44.340 --> 56:45.740
always works.

56:48.380 --> 56:50.060
Dig.

56:55.100 --> 56:57.940
What are they doing in there?

56:59.180 --> 57:00.900
Should've shot him myself.

57:00.980 --> 57:03.380
Yeah, well, you can't
trust them to do anything.

57:04.500 --> 57:07.260
I take it you're not
in a love situation.

57:07.340 --> 57:08.420
What?

57:09.500 --> 57:11.460
I mean you're not in love.

57:11.540 --> 57:13.180
What's it to you?

57:14.780 --> 57:15.980
Nothing.

57:19.100 --> 57:20.220
Just asking.

57:21.500 --> 57:23.780
I like it like that

57:23.860 --> 57:25.860
And I know it

57:27.700 --> 57:29.300
That's OK. You can stop now.

57:29.340 --> 57:31.260
No.

57:31.340 --> 57:32.500
I've waited long enough.

57:35.140 --> 57:36.300
No.

57:36.380 --> 57:38.220
Give me that. Lie down.

57:38.300 --> 57:40.140
No, no. No!

57:40.220 --> 57:43.060
Give it to me! Give it to me!

57:43.100 --> 57:44.180
Please!

57:45.860 --> 57:47.500
- Please.
- Shh.

57:47.580 --> 57:48.660
Aah!

57:52.660 --> 57:55.540
Leave it all behind

57:55.580 --> 57:56.660
I commit you to his mercy.

57:56.700 --> 57:58.660
Please. Please. Please.

58:00.140 --> 58:01.580
Aah!

58:03.540 --> 58:04.940
Aah! Aah!

58:05.020 --> 58:06.220
Aah!

58:06.300 --> 58:07.860
Aah!

58:07.940 --> 58:10.340
No! No!

58:10.420 --> 58:11.660
Get up!

58:11.740 --> 58:13.140
Robert, get off!

58:17.660 --> 58:19.060
Who are they?

58:19.140 --> 58:20.580
Come on!

58:21.700 --> 58:24.180
That's what keeps me

58:24.260 --> 58:26.220
That's what keeps me

58:26.300 --> 58:27.700
That's what keeps me down

58:27.740 --> 58:29.740
Aah!

58:31.740 --> 58:33.260
Ohh.

58:33.340 --> 58:35.220
Just for a minute there,
I thought we were in trouble.

58:35.260 --> 58:37.140
I told you don't get caught.

58:37.180 --> 58:38.900
Don't get out of the car.

58:38.940 --> 58:40.820
Don't ever go into the woods
with a stranger.

58:40.860 --> 58:42.900
- I know. You're right.
- I'm always right, OK?

58:42.980 --> 58:44.980
You might like to remember that.

58:45.020 --> 58:46.100
Have you got the money?

58:47.780 --> 58:48.980
- Aah!
- Aah!

58:51.100 --> 58:53.060
No! Jesus!

58:57.540 --> 58:58.580
I'm going to get you.

59:02.820 --> 59:04.300
Aah!

59:09.060 --> 59:10.100
Ohh!

59:10.180 --> 59:11.380
Shit.

59:24.780 --> 59:26.700
- Oh, shit.
- Where is she?

59:26.780 --> 59:28.180
Oh, shit.

59:32.860 --> 59:33.940
Drive!

59:43.140 --> 59:44.460
Ohh!

59:49.980 --> 59:51.380
Ohh!

59:55.540 --> 59:56.540
Jesus!

59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.180
- Jump!
- What?

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.420
Jump!

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.260
Aah!

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.420
Aah!

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.580
Aah!

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:15.460
Aah!

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.620
If the card's no good,
I'm authorized to destroy it.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.300
It's my card, lady.
Listen, you don't understand.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.340
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry about this, ma'am.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.900
Don't worry. Don't worry.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.220
I've got some cash, OK?

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.380
Thirty dollars, sir.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.460
Thank you.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.500
How could he
do a thing like that?

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.980
Stay calm, OK?

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:53.340
My own father.
He canceled my credit card.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:56.220
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.140
- I know exactly how you feel.
- You couldn't possibly know.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.900
Only the exceptionally rich
can know how I feel right now.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.020
Don't take it personally.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.860
Is he trying to say
I'll find my own natural level?

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.820
Sink to the bottom like her?

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.540
Like who?
Who are you talking about?

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.140
Pull over.

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.820
Oh, no.

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.300
Oh, no, no, no.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.420
Live a little.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.900
This is insane.

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.420
Stop worrying so much.
It'll be my first time, too.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.700
That's what I'm worrying about.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.580
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.740
Next.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.100
Hello.
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.980
I thought we agreed...
no clichés.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.740
Fill the bag.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.180
Oh, my God, she's got a gun!

01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.020
Leave my daughter alone.
Please, leave her alone!

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.180
- Don't be silly.
- She's going to kill her!

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.380
She's not going to kill
your daughter.

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.660
- Yes, I am.
- What?

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.580
Shut up.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.660
Christ, no!

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.780
Everybody calm down...,

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.820
or this girl's brains
will splatter the wall.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.620
- Fill the bag!
- Celine!

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.220
You shut up especially.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.860
You can't hold the girl hostage.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.220
What?

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.340
Oh, no!

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.780
You didn't find it difficult.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.740
- That was different.
- Was it?

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.340
Didn't feel different.
It felt just like this.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:28.660
Now do you understand
how it felt, Robert?

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.340
But you, unlike me,
couldn't pull the trigger.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.620
- Oh, no.
- Good-bye, Robert.

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.540
OK, kill me,
but don't touch the girl!

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.580
Extremely amusing!

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.900
" Kill me,
but don't touch the girl."

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.500
Robert,
you should be on television.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.460
- Very funny.
- What's wrong?

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.220
What's wrong? I thought
you were going to shoot me!

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.340
That's what's wrong!

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.340
Shoot you? I wouldn't do that.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.900
- Oh, no?
- No! I'm having a great time!

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.420
- Oh, good!
- Yeah, certainly is!

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.980
What's wrong?

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.500
Celine, it's over.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.580
Aah!

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.860
I'm dying, Celine.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.460
I think I'm dying,
and I don't want to die.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.140
You're not going to die.

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.620
I don't want to die.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.700
Are you taking me to a hospital?

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.740
Because I don't want to die
in a hospital.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.260
I'm not going
to take you to a hospital.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.860
What do you mean, you're not
taking me to a hospital?

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.900
Take me to a hospital!
Where are you taking me?

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.700
Very nice.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.940
Very nice, indeed.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.500
You could have a perfect smile.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.300
For two thousand dollars,
you could change your life.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.420
No, thanks.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.660
Do you think a perfect smile
just happens?

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.260
Is that what you think? Huh?

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.340
Do you think that Celine's smile
is her own?

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.500
No, it's not.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.060
It's mine.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.540
I gave it to her...

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.540
just like I can give you one.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.860
I'll fix your teeth
for twelve thousand dollars.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.420
I didn't get shot in the teeth.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.620
Well, let me tell you something.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.460
It wouldn't have made
too much difference if you had.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.580
I don't want to say anything.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.780
It's your teeth,
but if you wait another year...

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.940
you'll have fifty grand worth
of major reconstruction, so...

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.740
If you wait another year...

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.900
he'll be dead.

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:45.620
Sorry. Just a little
free consultation.

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:52.540
You know,
they wanted me to take a break.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:53.700
Take a break.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.660
Go get counseling, you know?

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.780
Fuck them. What do they know?

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.980
They wanted me to stay
in the hospital.

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:00.860
I discharged myself
this afternoon.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.060
Lucky for you that I did, huh?

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.420
OK.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.100
Have you, um, done this before?

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.340
The principles of surgery...

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.820
are the same
above and below the neck.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.940
Aah! Aah!

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.460
Aren't you going
to anesthetize me?

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.940
I'm sure you'll pass out
as the pain gets worse.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.420
Aah!

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.900
Aah!

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.460
Give me another one.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.820
Here we go, baby.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.980
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yaah!

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.980
Give it to me hot.
You look lovely.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.260
Thank you.

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.980
Give me the Bambi, baby.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.460
That's it.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.780
God!

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.780
OK, turn over. Turn over.

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.380
- What?
- Turn over, darling.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.140
Turn...

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.380
There you go.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.380
Flash me the tush.

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.260
One heel.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.580
Excellent.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:20.820
Mmm.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.780
Robbie!

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.740
Hey, how are you? Come on.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.100
Join the party.

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.220
Come on.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.540
Do you want some champagne?

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.380
How rude of me. Excuse me, love.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.140
Oh, wait.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.300
Here you go.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.740
Here. Look at that.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.540
So, I understand that you're...
Here, please.

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.380
I understand that
you're something of a fugitive.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.380
Don't be shocked.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.540
We go back a long way.

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.620
Oh, I see. You're her dentist.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.340
Yup. That's right.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.100
We met over that particularly
fine set of ivories.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.460
In fact...

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.020
I gave her her first filling.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.700
Ohh!

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.820
Fuck.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.220
Oh, I wish
you hadn't done that.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:13.780
Now I have to hurt you...

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.979
which is inconvenient
and undignified.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.540
Ohh!

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.500
Fucker.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.779
Get up!

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:26.899
Leave him alone, Elliot.

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:28.380
Why don't you
stay out of this?

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.260
Are you all right?

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.500
Uhh!

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.580
Gaah!

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.580
Uhh! Aah!

01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:10.220
You want to explain to me...

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.500
exactly what you were trying
to achieve back there?

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.859
How about you
do some explaining to me?

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:16.779
I didn't want you
bleeding to death...

01:09:16.859 --> 01:09:18.939
and I think I saved your life.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.380
I'd rather have died
than have witnessed that.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.700
Witnessed what, exactly?

01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:25.300
You and Elliot in
an advanced state of foreplay.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.540
He would've passed out
drunk in five minutes...

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.819
if you hadn't come along.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:29.979
Yeah, sure.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.380
Even if we were
about to get physical...

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.100
what's it got to do with you
anyway?

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.660
Aah.

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.660
You thought we had something?

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.020
It's possible.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.180
But why?

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:48.380
Why do we
have to have something?

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.540
We were getting along just fine.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.420
Having something
ruins everything.

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.140
What will you do now,
ask me to marry you?

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.580
Of course I'm not.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.740
- You thought about it.
- Don't be absurd.

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.220
It never even occurred to you?

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.420
Well, it wouldn't be so bad.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.540
You see what I mean?
Just forget it.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.100
Consider it forgotten.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.580
Where do you want to go?

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.780
Don't care.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.380
Do you want to get out
of the car?

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.620
- Are you asking me to get out?
- No. I'm asking if you want to.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.820
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.580
One is a request,
the other is a question.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:27.100
Fine. If that's what
you want, then I'll get out.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.140
If that's what you want,
go right ahead.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.700
And don't even ask
where I'm going!

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:32.460
Don't even imagine that I care.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.700
Exactly the problem!

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.860
Where's the love gone to?

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.580
Don't leave

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.260
You got me hurtin'

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.580
Don't leave

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.580
Yeah, yeah

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.820
Yeah, yeah

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.580
You know it's never been easy

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:54.100
To love someone like me

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.700
Oh, oh

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.100
Don't leave

01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.940
Yeah, yeah

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.100
Fuck.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.500
Where did all the love go?

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.700
Where's the love gone to?

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.500
Stop hovering over me.
I can't concentrate.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:20.460
Have you written anything yet?

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.940
I... I...

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.700
What am I supposed to write?

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:28.100
Love letters, Jackson,
deal with the subject of love.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:31.060
I need time to think.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.660
We don't have time.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.860
Every day they spend apart...

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.700
the more difficult
it's going to be.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:40.180
And if Naville finds our boy...

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.980
he's just meat.

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.540
Maybe I didn't treat you...

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.340
So, think, Jackson...

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.660
have you ever done this before?

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:59.100
Back when I was alive,
there was a girl.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.060
You wrote to some girl?

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.900
A long time ago.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.980
You never told me about this.

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:09.620
It never came to nothing.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.660
Her father
did not approve our match.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:15.580
It was just young love,
but I wrote...

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.260
many times...

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.980
with passion...

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.260
and despair.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.620
You were always on my mind

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.260
Maybe I didn't hold you

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.740
I never knew
you had a romantic soul.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.740
All those lonely, lonely nights

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:38.380
I often wonder
what became of that girl...

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.620
sweet Eliza.

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:44.020
Eliza...

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.140
Gray.

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.140
Her father was a colonel.

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.100
Jackson, you're qualified.

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.340
You can write this letter.

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.980
That's the problem, see?

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:02.860
I wrote to her, sure,
but I didn't write letters.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.140
Well, what, then?

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.500
As a matter of fact...

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.700
I...

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.340
wrote...

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.820
love poems.

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.500
Tell me that your sweet love

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:13.940
Tell me that your sweet love

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.900
Hasn't died

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.220
Give me

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.900
Give me one more chance

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.260
To keep you satisfied

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.860
Remember, my dear...

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.700
they only want one thing.

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.060
Maybe they want it
more than once...

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.340
but it's still
only one thing.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:38.900
Little things

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.260
I should have said

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.660
And done

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:47.580
I just never took the time

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.500
You were always on my mind

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.780
You were always on my mind

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:59.220
You were always on my mind

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.660
I wish
you had let me read that poem.

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.300
A poem...

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.140
is a very personal document.

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.300
I hope it was a good one.

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.900
That's all I'm saying.

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.660
Because if she don't like it,
she won't come.

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.220
And if she don't come,
we're stuck.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:16.820
It's her.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.060
- I got your poem.
- Sorry?

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.140
Your poem...
the one you wrote me.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.500
Poem?

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.540
"Oh, desert me,
wretched loneliness...

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:08.180
"and bring me back my love...

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.060
"for she and I have parted...

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.260
"and the sky is up above."

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.420
It worked.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.740
She loves it.

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.820
" Your limbs
so svelte and slender..."

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:25.820
"Your touch...

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:27.380
"so soft and tender."

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.980
"But the bits
that I like best...

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.140
"are the bits that..."

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.380
I'm not going to read that line.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.900
Jackson, Jackson,
what the hell did you write?

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.020
It was a...

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.140
Yeah?

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.340
A simple poetic reference...

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.940
uh, to...

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.340
Celine.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.540
Please.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.740
Last verse.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.300
"Just as the flowers blossom...

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.300
"in the gaze
of the shining sun..."

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.820
"I would be most honored..."

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.860
"if you would bear my son."

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:10.140
Robert, no one has ever
written me a poem before.

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.580
All those guys I dated,
they didn't care about me.

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.220
They just wanted to own this.

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.660
Huh?

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:19.860
I would never open
my heart to any of those guys.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.420
And before I met you...

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.940
I never believed
that there was any alternative.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.380
Oh!

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.860
I knew it!

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.700
But when you
stopped that bullet...

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.900
Ha ha ha ha!

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.820
and got the wrong idea
about Elliot...

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.580
I knew it!

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.340
I should've understood.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.460
- Celine...
- No. Let me finish.

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.380
This is difficult for me
to say...

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.500
but I feel I can trust you.

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:43.860
I didn't write the poem.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.860
What?

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.220
I didn't write it.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.780
I've never written a poem
in my life.

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.900
How can anybody
be that honest?

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.900
It's his handwriting.
Tell him it's his handwriting.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.100
But it's your handwriting.

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.700
It... it has this address.

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.820
It even has some sort of cheap
aftershave on the paper.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.340
I didn't write the poem, OK?

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.180
Oh, my God.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.580
Celine, no need to...

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.660
Human fucking beings.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.180
What do you have to do?

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:20.780
We did everything for them!

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:22.460
Brought them together.
Put them in jeopardy.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.420
We damn near killed them both!

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.260
We gave them every opportunity.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.940
All they had to do
was fall in love...

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.300
and we could've gone home.

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.980
Maybe we failed, Jackson...

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.980
but we don't have to live
like this.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:55.020
Is she gone?

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.180
Yeah.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.780
Nice-looking woman.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.420
She isn't my type.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.660
What are you talking about?

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.380
Look at yourself.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.020
You're nobody.

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.540
You're nothing.

01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:15.820
You're wanted in connection
with a violent crime.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.300
You're cleaning the floor
of a diner.

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:23.380
She is an intelligent,
passionate...

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.340
beautiful rich woman.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.420
The issue of whether or not
she's your type...

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.460
is not one
that you are likely...

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.820
to have to resolve
in this world.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.420
She's there watching for me

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:43.340
Or indeed the next, since she
will be going to some heaven...

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.100
for glamorous pussy...

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:49.780
and you will be cleaning
the floor of a diner...

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.700
in hell.

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.580
I guess so.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:58.260
So why are you even
thinking about it?

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.700
I don't know.

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.260
Stupid...

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.340
Come on.

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.420
Finish the floor.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:23.900
What the fuck?

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.580
Aah!

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.220
Shut up!

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.220
Where's my beautiful poem?

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.780
Your father's not home yet.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.100
I don't expect he'll pay
our ransom straight off.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.700
Not till we send a few fingers
through the mail.

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:03.020
Ooh.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.540
Sixteen.

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.580
I'm gonna stick right there.

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.500
Say, how about you?

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.700
You want a hit?

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.620
No.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:21.100
Mmm, stay.

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.020
- Uh-huh?
- No.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.380
- Hit?
- No!

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.260
Now, Miss Naville...

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.500
you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.980
you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.660
You can stick right there...

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.300
and you got
four thousand dollars.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.420
Mm-hmm.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:35.980
But you want another hit? OK.

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.100
No, no!

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.100
- What is that?
- Answer it, Jackson.

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.140
I can't do that.
I'm playing blackjack.

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:44.660
She might cheat
while I'm out of the room.

01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:50.420
All right.

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.660
I'll answer the door.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.740
You play blackjack
with the hostage.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:02.940
You sure you want
to increase your bet...

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:04.580
before you take another hit?

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.340
No!

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:07.540
No!

01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.300
OK.

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:12.460
No!

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:16.100
And...

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.460
No!

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:21.620
Aah!

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.900
Well...

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.780
There.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.820
It's just as well
we're not playing for real.

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.340
Come on!

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:43.900
All right, now cut her free.

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.020
Aah!

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.460
What the hell did you do to her?

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.860
I punched her in the face.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.860
Oh! Ow!

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.820
Oh, you punched her in the face.

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:55.980
She's half your size,
and you punch her?

01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.980
- She had a gun!
- Oh, she had a gun?

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.340
So that makes
everything all right, does it?

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.380
I'm not saying
it makes everything all right.

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.660
I'm just trying to explain
that for all I knew...

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.900
she could have been
a karate expert or something.

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.060
With a broken arm?

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:09.820
With a broken arm?!

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.940
OK. I'm sorry.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.820
Now just cut her free!

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.580
You son of a bitch!

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.860
- Celine?
- What do you want?

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:30.900
I'm just trying to explain.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.020
Aah!

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.860
Despite your crummy poem...

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.300
I came to visit
and all you could do...

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.460
was humiliate me
and turn me away.

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:40.500
I thought you were decent.

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.620
I thought you were different,
but you're not.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.060
You're just a lying, cheating
son of a bitch...

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.380
just like all the rest!

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.340
Celine,
I never meant to hurt you!

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.780
I don't know
who wrote that poem...

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.900
but I'll tell you,
those are my feelings.

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:54.220
Oh, sure.

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:55.860
Not so easy now, huh?

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.540
Celine, Celine!

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.140
When you left the diner
last night...

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.980
I realized
I'd turned away the woman...

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.380
whom I'd spent the happiest...

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.340
most exciting times
of my life with...

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.060
who I care for
more than anyone on the earth!

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:11.500
Listen, listen!

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:14.060
Do you remember
that dream I had?

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.940
I dreamed that my life
was in danger...

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.340
that my heart stopped.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.980
But you saved my life...

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.860
when you pierced my heart
with an arrow of your love.

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.860
And that's the truth.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:30.460
Celine, what I'm saying
is that I love you.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:33.700
What? What did you say?

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:36.420
What I was trying to say
was that I...

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.460
Oh, shit.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.140
What?

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:43.180
Who is that?

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.780
Don't worry, Miss Celine.

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:47.060
Everything's going to be
just fine.

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.740
Aah!

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.820
Well, we're not just gonna
leave them here, are we?

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.340
No, sir.

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.580
Come in.

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:36.780
Yes, there is a

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.380
Deeper river

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:43.580
That will bring you

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.820
Home again

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.660
Oh, there is a

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:54.780
Deeper river

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:57.940
Flowing under

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.060
I don't think
they're coming back.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.260
Isn't there anything you can do?

01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:06.020
I don't have the authority
to intervene.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:08.580
Deeper river

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.540
I don't have the authority
to intervene!

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:12.620
That will bring you

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.380
Home again

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.300
Let me out of this trunk now!

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.460
Robert, he's gonna kill you!

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.580
Just run.
He doesn't want the money, OK?

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.380
He's gonna kill you!

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.060
Just run, Robert, run!

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.500
It's probably
in the canoe, Mr. Naville.

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.660
That's probably where it is.

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.900
It's not in the canoe, sir...

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:43.260
but I think it's, uh, upstairs.

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:45.420
I think it's upstairs.
Might've put it there.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:48.660
They probably left it
under the bed.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.980
That would be a good place.

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.340
Tsk tsk tsk.

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.980
I don't think he has it...

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.100
Mr. Naville.

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.380
No. I...

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.900
that's it!

01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:59.620
That's where it is!

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.820
That's where it was.

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:02.780
I put it under that board.

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.380
I'll have your money back to you
in a minute, Mr. Naville, sir.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.100
Board up, and then
we'll get it back to you.

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.780
We're just gonna have
to face the truth, Robert.

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.620
You don't have my money.

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.420
Yeah, it's down here,
all right, Mr. Naville, sir.

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.620
Just where I left it.

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.620
And frankly, I don't care.

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.260
It's just a detail.

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:26.780
You'll have your money
back in a second, sir.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:30.540
Long as you understand
that it isn't the money.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.860
It's the principle.

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:42.420
Somebody please
just let me out of here!

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.980
Mayhew, not with the ax.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.420
This is Gabriel.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.580
Get me God.

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:56.660
Let's go. Come on!

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.900
Come on, come on!

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:02.780
Robert, what happened was
you shot them, and then you...

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:07.100
Did he just move?

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.660
No, sir.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:12.020
In all respect, sir, how could
anything be beyond your control?

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.340
Anyway, you shot them...

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.420
then you shot...

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.660
You sure he didn't move?

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.780
I'm quite sure, sir.

01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.260
Yes, sir.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.620
No, sir.

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.900
Sir?

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.020
Please.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.180
Yeah, quite.

01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.380
Yeah, right.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.460
Mayhew, she's moved.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.260
She's moved.

01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:47.820
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.100
Yes, sir.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.540
Thank you, sir.

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:54.380
They are both dead, sir.

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:56.180
I shot them myself.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.780
I won't disturb you again.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.380
Yahoo!

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.060
Who's that?

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.780
Robert?

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.020
You shot them...

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.900
and then you shot yourself,
and then...

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.740
you set fire to this cabin.

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.860
Didn't you?

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.820
Not yet, he didn't.

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.860
Celine.

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:27.380
Why...

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:30.980
Why don't you just
put that gun down, hmm?

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.020
Do not get in my way, father.

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.980
Celine...

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.220
you're not responsible
for your actions.

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:39.340
You're unhinged.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:43.020
You need the best
psychiatric treatment...

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:44.340
that money can buy...

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.820
just like your mother.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.260
So why don't you just...

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:54.500
Why don't you just
give me the gun?

01:28:58.340 --> 01:28:59.820
Because as he dreamt...

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:03.540
I shall save his life
with an arrow...

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.060
an arrow of my love for him.

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.420
Kill him, Mayhew.

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.100
Ezekiel!

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:42.380
He's alive, Mayhew.

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:46.260
They're all alive.

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.660
If I were your woman

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:10.860
And you were my man

01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:13.260
You'd have no other woman

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:17.060
You'd be weak as a lamb

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.820
If you had the strength

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.940
To walk out that door

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:25.900
My love would overrule my sense

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.020
And I'd call you back for more

01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.260
If I were your woman

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.420
So you're telling me
that successful relationships...

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.620
are made in heaven?

01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.380
Not founded
on the daily practicality...

01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.420
of two people being prepared...

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.220
to tolerate the imperfections
of one another?

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.940
It's not successful
relationships, Celine.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.300
It's love. And it comes from
a strange and wonderful place...

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.820
that we don't know about.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.620
So you also reject the idea...

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.540
that love is merely
an emotional adaptation...

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.420
to a physical necessity?

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.580
Completely.

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.260
Are you serious?

01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:00.620
Fate intervenes
in people's lives.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.180
In ours, for instance.

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.900
Fate brought us together.

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.300
It kept us together.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.900
We were destined
for one another.

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.540
Fate had a pretty strange way
of making its point.

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.580
But that's
part of the beauty of it.

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.820
It's inexplicable,
unpredictable...

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:20.780
and absolutely beyond control
or understanding.

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:22.820
But you nearly got killed.

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.620
But I didn't...

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.740
and here we are.

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:30.460
Do you have any substantial
evidence to back all this?

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.580
None at all.

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:34.260
And you realize
that it's absurd and irrational?

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.740
I know that.

01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:38.140
Then why do you believe it?

01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:40.700
Because, Celine, I'm a dreamer.

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:46.140
Well, I guess
that makes two of us.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.380
Are you ready?

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:52.540
As I'll ever be.

01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:54.980
Then let's go.

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.700
But I'm too afraid to show it

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.300
If I were your woman

01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:01.580
If you were my woman

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.420
If I were your woman

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.700
If you were my woman

01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:06.180
If I were your woman

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:08.220
If you were my woman

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.740
Never, no, no, no

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.860
Stop loving you

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:19.860
Oh, yeah

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:23.260
If I were your woman

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:27.020
Do you know what I'd do?

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:31.100
I'd never, never, never
stop loving you

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.420
If I were your woman

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.140
Your sweet loving woman

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.660
If you were my woman

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.420
If I were your woman

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.860
If you were my woman

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.500
I'd be your only woman

01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:44.660
If you were my woman

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:46.180
If I were your woman

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.660
If you were my woman

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:48.060
You'd need no other woman

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.260
You'd need no other woman

01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.020
All clear.

01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:11.300
So, how was it?

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:13.100
Believe me, Gabriel.

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.780
You don't want to know.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:17.580
- But it worked.
- Yeah.

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:20.540
Love...

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:21.620
worked.

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:25.820
Ameratus pathum laborium.

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.780
Are we going home now?

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:29.940
We're going home.

01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.740
At last.

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.900
Ohh!

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.900
The paper boy
is looking before he goes

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.100
Lying to the teacher
who knows he knows

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:10.340
He didn't, and he should've
brought his lines in yesterday

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:16.180
Ernie bangs the sound
as the day begins

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.220
The letterbox is open,
and your cash falls in

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.740
Aah!

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:24.300
I'll meet you at the office
just before the staff clock in

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.860
Round our way

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.820
The birds are singing

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:34.940
Round our way

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:38.220
The sun shines bright

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:40.140
Aah!

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.180
Round our way

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:44.780
The birds sing for you

01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:48.740
'Cause they already know you

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:52.020
Yeah, they already know you

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:06.740
The game is kicking off
in around the park

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:09.740
It's twenty-five a side,
and before it's dark

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.260
There's gonna be a loser

01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.460
And you know the next goal wins

01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:17.460
Cab it to the front

01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.580
As it's called a draw

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:22.660
Everybody's knocking
at yours once more

01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:24.660
Ernie bangs the sound

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:27.220
And no one's spoken
since half past four

01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:30.020
La la la la la la la

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.420
Round our way
the birds are singing

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:41.780
Round our way
the sun shines bright

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:48.500
Round our way
the birds sing for you

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:51.860
'Cause they already know you

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:56.660
Yeah, they already know you

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.460
On the highway

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.060
Unpaved

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:04.740
Going my way

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.020
You're so alone today

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.940
Like a ghost town

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:12.020
I found there's no relief

01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:14.180
No soul to mercy

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:17.460
Is it true what they say?

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.380
You can't behave

01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:22.300
You gamble your soul away

01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.700
Measuring your dreams

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.500
Oh, this life seems

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.020
Like the gristle of loneliness

01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:31.900
Do do do do

01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:36.860
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.700
Do do do do do

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:45.100
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:00.500
Like an ice age

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:03.540
Nice days on your way

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:06.220
Sipping the golden dregs

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.860
On a riptide

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.300
Freaks ride

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.940
Sleep inside

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.820
A parasite's appetite

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:16.580
Oh, say, can't you see

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.260
The chemistry?

01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:21.260
The parasites, the cleanup fee

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:23.700
Death metal hands

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:25.660
Recycled cans

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:30.700
Get well cards
to the hostage vans

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:36.140
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:37.700
Do do do do do

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:43.980
Don't let the sun
catch you crying

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.780
I got a magical ray

01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:50.900
That reads you
like a book, yeah

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:55.540
You got a mystic pen
that sends me the message

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:58.100
Tests of my strength

01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.900
Are pretty much all I know

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:03.620
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere

01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:07.700
Climbing

01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:10.980
Climbing

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.540
Somewhere

01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:18.820
Somewhere

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:22.820
And I have no fear

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:26.660
I have no fear

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:31.020
'Cause love is here

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:35.300
Love is here

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:39.420
Love is here

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.260
Love is here

01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:44.500
Love is...

01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.500
Did you know
that I'm looking at you now

01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:48.740
With a daisy in my hair

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:49.940
Roses in my hand

01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.620
And broken rhythms in disrepair

01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.740
I hear

01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:56.260
A danger in the air

01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:00.260
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere

01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:03.820
Climbing

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:07.700
Climbing

01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:10.340
Somewhere

01:39:15.341 --> 01:39:16.341
