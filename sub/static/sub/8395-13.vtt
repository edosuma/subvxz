WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:03.089
Well, of course all
the cousins know about it.

00:03.140 --> 00:04.334
- I know, but--
- Tomato, tomato salad.

00:04.380 --> 00:06.780
- No, no, no, not tomato.
- I don't know, Caesar salad.

00:06.830 --> 00:09.298
Uh, she wants like
old-fashiony music, you know?

00:09.350 --> 00:11.409
The entire Arizona
contingent IS coming.

00:11.450 --> 00:12.553
- Okay, you got that?
- All the cousins?

00:12.590 --> 00:14.342
- Yes, all of them.
- Can I add ten to that, please?

00:14.390 --> 00:15.527
[everyone talking
on the phone]

00:15.560 --> 00:18.495
Ten more in addition to the--
whatever we already had.

00:18.530 --> 00:20.077
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.701
[baby Zeek wails]
- It's okay.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.708
I don't know who's
paying for this, but--

00:23.740 --> 00:25.799
Can I see this little baby?

00:25.850 --> 00:27.499
You know, you
need a glider.

00:27.540 --> 00:30.191
- Shh, I need so many things.
- I don't know. Does she really?

00:30.230 --> 00:31.606
Well, where would you
put the glider?

00:31.650 --> 00:33.129
You'd have to remove the oven
to put the glider In.

00:33.170 --> 00:34.785
Well, you know,
it's an absolute life saver.

00:34.820 --> 00:37.709
Really. We're gonna make that
our gift to you.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.682
That's so sweet,
I just don't even--

00:39.720 --> 00:42.063
- Yeah.
- Know where I'd put it. It's--

00:42.110 --> 00:43.611
Well, you're not gonna
be staying here.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.582
I mean, this is
a really cool apartment,

00:45.630 --> 00:48.076
but you don't want
to raise Zeek here.

00:48.110 --> 00:51.591
I don't really
have a choice right now.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.006
It's just
a nightmare.

00:53.050 --> 00:55.518
[Adam]
No, the timing is perfect and
I'm up for the challenge.

00:55.570 --> 00:58.562
My forte is helping
businesses get back on track.

00:58.610 --> 01:01.670
And here's the great thing is,
uh, we love the product.

01:01.710 --> 01:03.530
We've been a
Mountain Spring Water household

01:03.580 --> 01:05.229
for, I don't know,
like, ten years now.

01:05.270 --> 01:07.226
My wife is always talking about
how she can taste the purity.

01:07.270 --> 01:08.237
Dad, hang up the phone. Hang up
the phone. Hang up the phone.

01:08.270 --> 01:09.498
- Hang up the phone.
- Hold on a second, Max.

01:09.550 --> 01:10.505
- No, this is an emergency.
- Yup, no, Monday sounds great.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.472
- [shushes]
- Dad, hang it up! Hang it up!

01:12.520 --> 01:13.407
I will see you Monday, thank
you very much. Goodbye.

01:13.450 --> 01:14.269
- Hang it up. Hang it up.
- Hey, Max.

01:14.310 --> 01:15.584
_ - Yes. _
- This was a busmess call.

01:15.620 --> 01:16.439
This _is
also busmess.

01:16.490 --> 01:17.559
I just got
off the phone with Hank

01:17.590 --> 01:18.579
and I have a job.

01:18.630 --> 01:19.585
You just got
off the phone with Hank?

01:19.630 --> 01:20.892
Yes, I
have a job.

01:20.940 --> 01:21.895
- That's wonderful. Doing what?
- Yep.

01:21.940 --> 01:22.907
I'm going to be
a photographer.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.521
- For who?
- This is great that

01:24.560 --> 01:25.766
you're gonna be assisting Hank.
- I'm not going to be

01:25.800 --> 01:27.210
assisting Hank. You need to work
on your listening skills.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.729
I am going to be
the sole photographer,

01:28.770 --> 01:31.182
the main photographer at
Aunt Sarah and Hank's wedding.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.289
- Max, that is great.
- Yes. It is amazing, yes.

01:32.330 --> 01:33.706
That shows a lot of
faith in you, that's wonderful.

01:33.740 --> 01:34.638
Wait, all the photos
that are

01:34.680 --> 01:36.739
gonna be on
the mantle forever and ever?

01:36.780 --> 01:37.747
Yes, all of the photos.
All of the photos.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.293
- You're gonna take?
- Yes.

01:39.340 --> 01:40.329
- You're sure? _
- Yes, I'm absolutely certain.

01:40.370 --> 01:41.712
That's really
incredible.

01:41.750 --> 01:42.671
Also, Hank says I need to
have a talk

01:42.720 --> 01:43.812
with the both of you
about whether or not

01:43.860 --> 01:45.122
I should get the money now

01:45.170 --> 01:46.512
or it should be put
in an account

01:46.550 --> 01:48.336
for when I am 18.
- Oh. I'm glad Hank

01:48.380 --> 01:49.404
brought that up.
- He's very thorough.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.519
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:50.550 --> 01:52.552
I vote strongly that it
should be given to me now.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.579
Um, we'll
talk about it.

01:53.630 --> 01:55.552
We'll take that
into consideration.

01:55.590 --> 01:57.558
I'm employed!

01:57.600 --> 02:00.216
[laughs] Well, at least
somebody's got a job they love.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.285
That's fantastic.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.287
But I'm not complaining
because

02:02.320 --> 02:03.321
this house is
gonna be full

02:03.360 --> 02:04.452
of cool, delicious
spring water.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.524
That's right.

02:05.570 --> 02:09.700
I don't like spring water.
I like soda.

02:09.750 --> 02:10.739
Have you been
giving her soda?

02:10.780 --> 02:11.769
[laughs] No.

02:11.820 --> 02:13.367
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Never.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.573
The odds are excellent.
I'm super smart. Right, Mom?

02:15.610 --> 02:17.646
You are super smart. I wouldn't
put it past you.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.159
Hm. Dad,
what do you think?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.337
I'd vote for you now.

02:20.380 --> 02:21.927
- Ha!
- Great, so you have one vote.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.961
You have two votes!

02:23.000 --> 02:24.308
[phone rings]There you go.

02:24.350 --> 02:25.419
- Two votes. Okay.
- I'll hang out in

02:25.450 --> 02:27.725
the oval office.
Redecorate.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.625
Maybe paint
the White House pink.

02:29.660 --> 02:30.581
[Joel]
Hm, is it work?

02:30.630 --> 02:32.552
I don't--
I don't know.

02:32.600 --> 02:38.561
Hello?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.398
Uh-huh.

02:41.430 --> 02:44.228
Yeah, um,
what is this about?

02:44.260 --> 02:48.264
Can you tell me?

02:48.300 --> 02:51.599
Okay. Yeah,
we'll be there.

02:51.650 --> 02:53.470
Thanks.

02:53.510 --> 02:55.398
Who was it?

02:55.450 --> 02:57.270
Victor's
socral worker.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.756
She wants to see us
tomorrow at 11 AM.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.755
About what?

03:00.800 --> 03:01.824
I don't know.
She just said

03:01.870 --> 03:02.859
_ it was_ _
tIme senSItIve,

03:02.900 --> 03:05.175
and she_wanted to
see us In person.

03:10.530 --> 03:12.566
So, what's on
your mind, Hank?

03:12.600 --> 03:14.636
Uh, well...
[clears throat]

03:14.670 --> 03:16.843
Sorry to bother you,
but I just know that

03:16.880 --> 03:19.872
Sarah's told you about us
and the plans

03:19.920 --> 03:24.505
and I just wanted
to come by,

03:24.540 --> 03:26.542
man-to-man
and--

03:26.580 --> 03:28.753
and ask
for your blessings.

03:28.790 --> 03:29.950
Really?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.444
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.926
I realize it's _
ba5|cally symbolic.

03:33.970 --> 03:36.894
Oh, no, no, no.
That's--more than symbolic.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.384
It_'s--it's
very Important.

03:38.420 --> 03:39.762
It's a major decision
here.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.381
Come on and
have a seat

03:41.420 --> 03:47.325
and--you know--
- Yeah. All right.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.772
So, uh,
[exhales]

03:49.810 --> 03:53.564
what would you like to say,
Hank Rizzoli?

03:53.610 --> 03:57.603
Well, uh, I don't know
if Sarah told you about

03:57.650 --> 04:01.814
the Asperger's thing.
Like Max.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.304
What do you mean?

04:03.340 --> 04:05.717
Uh, well, I-- okay,
I guess she didn't tell you,

04:05.760 --> 04:08.035
but, uh,

04:08.070 --> 04:11.688
that's me too
to some degree, so--

04:11.730 --> 04:13.960
just wanna make sure
all the cards are on the table.

04:14.010 --> 04:18.049
[exhales]
Right.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.524
I mean,
it's a surprise.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.835
I--it kind of
explains a few things.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.769
But, um, if Sarah's
okay with it

04:24.810 --> 04:26.801
then I am too.
There's--

04:26.850 --> 04:29.398
Ah, well,
good. Thanks.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.465
You know, Sarah,
of all my kids,

04:31.510 --> 04:34.058
I--I think she's kind of
been my teacher, you know?

04:34.100 --> 04:38.400
She's the one that--
in--in life--

04:38.450 --> 04:41.897
has taught me more about
unconditional love.

04:41.930 --> 04:44.103
She never went after
the material things in life.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.654
The clothes, the cars,
you know, all that stuff.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.452
The money.

04:48.490 --> 04:52.039
She was all about love.
She was all about

04:52.080 --> 04:55.732
really giving her heart
to the people

04:55.770 --> 04:58.705
that she cared about
the most.

04:58.740 --> 05:02.608
I just--would ask--
ask you--uh...

05:05.780 --> 05:11.400
you take care of my--
my--

05:11.440 --> 05:14.682
my daughter.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.723
- Yeah.
- You be there for her.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.513
Yeah, that's, uh--

05:20.560 --> 05:24.656
that's--that's gonna be
my honor to do that.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.808
I--I never met
anybody like her.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.081
I'm never gonna
stop loving her.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.702
Yeah.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.368
Thanks.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.435
There's probably
another thing

05:38.470 --> 05:41.746
that I came by for
to tell you.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.168
Uh, we spoke
about it

05:43.200 --> 05:45.714
and she wants to
do it Saturday.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.479
This Saturday?

05:47.510 --> 05:50.718
Yeah.
Yeah, that's uh--

05:50.760 --> 05:51.784
that's what
she wants.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.752
Well, what's
the rush here?

05:53.800 --> 05:57.588
I mean...

05:57.630 --> 06:03.523
Oh...right.

06:03.570 --> 06:07.040
Okay,
I get it.

06:07.090 --> 06:08.705
[sighs]

06:08.740 --> 06:11.152
[Bob Dylan]
May God bless
and keep you always

06:11.190 --> 06:13.818
And may your wishes
all come true

06:13.850 --> 06:16.159
May you always do
for others

06:16.200 --> 06:18.748
And let others do for you

06:18.790 --> 06:21.167
May you build a ladder
to the stars

06:21.200 --> 06:23.589
And climb on every rung

06:23.620 --> 06:25.679
And may you stay

06:25.730 --> 06:28.198
Forever young

06:28.240 --> 06:30.868
May you grow up
to be righteous

06:30.900 --> 06:33.619
May you grow up
to be true

06:33.660 --> 06:36.174
May you always know
the truth

06:36.220 --> 06:38.563
And see the lights
surrounding you

06:38.600 --> 06:41.182
May you always be
courageous

06:41.220 --> 06:42.630
Stand upright
and be strong

06:42.670 --> 06:44.706
And may you stay

06:44.740 --> 06:47.675
Forever young

06:47.710 --> 06:49.598
May you stay

06:49.650 --> 06:52.744
Forever young

06:56.510 --> 06:57.750
- [baby talk]
- Hello!

06:57.790 --> 06:58.779
_- Hello!
- HI, you guys!

06:58.830 --> 07:03.517
- Is it baby time?
- It's the baby Zeek! Aw.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.859
- Congrats.
- He's in a good mood too.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.039
Aw.
We brought you presents.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.104
Yeah.

07:10.150 --> 07:11.242
[both]
One for baby.

07:11.290 --> 07:12.803
And one for
bigger baby!

07:12.840 --> 07:14.148
Bread!

07:14.190 --> 07:15.976
Yes. Woo!

07:16.020 --> 07:18.045
- Mama gotta eat too, remember.
- Here. Let me move all this

07:18.090 --> 07:20.536
stuff, sorry. Just
a huge amount of things here.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.777
No, it looks
great in here.

07:22.820 --> 07:23.844
- Can I hold him?
- Oh, of course.

07:23.890 --> 07:26.267
Here, here, here.
- Ah. Yes.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.335
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

07:27.370 --> 07:29.645
Don't let your ovaries
get activated. Play it safe.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.510
[laughs] Sorry,
this is so messy.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.472
I have, like,
so much stuff.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.373
Oh, look, look, look

07:34.410 --> 07:36.230
at that little play-penny thing.
- Yeah?

07:36.280 --> 07:38.134
Haddie got it for me.
It's for work.

07:38.180 --> 07:39.272
[muffled] I guess
I'll bring the baby

07:39.320 --> 07:41.242
and he's gonna just,
like, chill there.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.599
And he'll be quiet,
I mean,

07:42.630 --> 07:45.076
I can still do everything
I need to.

07:45.110 --> 07:51.151
Oy. Boy, I don't know
how to say this, but--

07:51.190 --> 07:53.909
it's a cute play pen,
but it's--we're gonna--

07:53.950 --> 07:57.534
we're shutting down
The Luncheonette.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.502
What are you talking about?

07:59.540 --> 08:02.191
What happened?
We had the insurance payment

08:02.240 --> 08:06.518
and--and--the--you
already ordered all the stuff,

08:06.550 --> 08:07.892
Crosby, why would you--?

08:07.930 --> 08:09.579
And then--and then
I had to cancel it all.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.689
Why? Why would
you do that?

08:10.730 --> 08:13.938
You know we had some--
the obVIous fInanCIal Issues.

08:13.970 --> 08:16.177
Of course, obviously,
but we had jobs booked!

08:16.210 --> 08:17.791
I mean, you have to
give it a little bit of time.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.148
Like, there's no reason
for you to--

08:19.180 --> 08:20.863
Okay, well, you know what?
It's Adam. I don't--

08:20.910 --> 08:22.639
the truth is, it's Adam.
He doesn't wanna do it.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.762
And we can't do it
without him

08:23.810 --> 08:25.903
and I don't--

08:25.950 --> 08:27.531
have an explanation
other than that.

08:27.570 --> 08:31.848
He--he didn't want to
go for it like we did, so--

08:31.890 --> 08:34.882
but, um, there's this
for you.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.957
I wish it were more.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.786
Um, but hopefully it
can get you by for a while,

08:39.820 --> 08:42.994
while you figure out
something else.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.626
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

08:48.660 --> 08:49.866
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.004
I know--I know you
would have done anything

08:52.040 --> 08:54.668
to save it, so--

08:54.700 --> 08:56.668
you did what
you could.

08:56.700 --> 09:01.046
[Damien Rice's
Trusty and True]

09:01.090 --> 09:06.778
Because we can't take back

09:06.820 --> 09:09.288
What is done

09:09.340 --> 09:13.686
What is past

09:13.720 --> 09:16.848
So let us

09:16.900 --> 09:21.894
Start from here

09:32.430 --> 09:34.148
Spoke to Amber.

09:34.190 --> 09:35.919
Oh yeah?
How'd that go?

09:35.950 --> 09:38.259
She took it
pretty well.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.847
You give her
the check?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.950
Yep.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.878
She--uh--seem like
she felt like it was

09:43.920 --> 09:45.649
a fair amount?

09:45.680 --> 09:49.719
Well, she didn't
open it in front of me.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.648
I'm just about done
packing up here.

09:51.690 --> 09:54.682
Gonna head downstairs and
clean out the counter area,

09:54.730 --> 09:56.413
and that'll do it.
Just have to have you sign

09:56.450 --> 10:00.625
these dissolution papers.

10:00.660 --> 10:05.666
Three signatures and
we can get out of here.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.429
Just sign 'em?

10:07.460 --> 10:09.212
Yeah, it's standard--
it's what you do

10:09.260 --> 10:10.704
when you dissolve a business.
- I think I should

10:10.740 --> 10:13.083
read them
ﬁrst.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.439
Crosby, you haven't read
a single contract

10:14.470 --> 10:16.392
since we opened business.
Why--why start now?

10:16.440 --> 10:18.294
Yeah, well I had a partner
who loved reading contracts

10:18.340 --> 10:22.265
and now I don't,
so...

10:22.310 --> 10:26.371
Crosby, I'm sorry that
this is coming to an end.

10:26.410 --> 10:28.992
But we're brothers,
so can you...

10:29.040 --> 10:31.031
not treat me like
somebody you barely know?

10:31.070 --> 10:32.207
I'll let you know
what I think

10:32.250 --> 10:36.903
after I
read them.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.761
Okay.
Sounds good.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.476
[Kristina]
I don't know about this,
buddy.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.683
Although, they do say
if it rains on your wedding day

10:57.720 --> 10:59.267
it's good luck
and that's good.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.402
- Who says that?
- Just people.

11:00.450 --> 11:01.474
- What people?
- I don't know,

11:01.520 --> 11:03.408
people in general.
- You should know who you're

11:03.450 --> 11:05.793
quoting before you quote them.
- Well, I don't know.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.036
Just that it's true.
- I'm gomg to need

11:07.080 --> 11:08.968
a 300mm zoom lens.
- A what?

11:09.010 --> 11:10.034
- Write that down.
- Okay. 300mm.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.286
- 300mm zoom lens.
- We need to actually go to

11:11.320 --> 11:13.732
the tailor quickly because
your pants need to get hemmed

11:13.770 --> 11:14.998
for that suit.
- My pants don't need to

11:15.050 --> 11:16.699
be hemmed because I_ will
not be wearIng a swt.

11:16.740 --> 11:17.729
Oh, honey, you're wearing
a suit, we talked about this.

11:17.780 --> 11:18.735
I will be wearing
a black shirt and black pants,

11:18.780 --> 11:19.849
because I'm the photographer.
The photographer

11:19.880 --> 11:20.949
needs to disappear.
- It's Aunt Sarah's wedding.

11:20.990 --> 11:22.708
Stand right there, I need
to take a picture of you.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.126
Everyone's gonna
come in.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.229
And some of _them haven't
seen you In forever.

11:25.270 --> 11:26.225
Stand right there, I need
to take a picture of you.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.953
Your aunts, your uncles.
I want you to dance

11:27.990 --> 11:29.025
and party and be--
- I don't care

11:29.060 --> 11:30.402
about any of that.
- A part of the celebration.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.372
I love that you love
taking pictures,

11:31.410 --> 11:33.856
but I want you to be
in the picture, okay?

11:33.900 --> 11:35.231
Should I smile?

11:35.280 --> 11:36.827
Is this good?

11:36.860 --> 11:38.202
Your complexion
is far too pale.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.719
You make
a terrible assistant.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.579
Let's go get
your pants hemmed.

11:40.630 --> 11:42.200
I guarantee I won't
be wearing a suit.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.218
You're wearing
a suit, Max!

11:44.250 --> 11:45.729
You're wearing a suit.
- I will not be

11:45.770 --> 11:46.998
wearing a suit.
- I promise you, you are.

11:47.050 --> 11:48.074
Thank you again
for coming in

11:48.120 --> 11:49.075
on such short notice.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.189
- Yeah.
- Of course.

11:50.220 --> 11:51.733
Um, is everything okay?

11:51.780 --> 11:52.872
Something's come up
with Victor's birth mother

11:52.910 --> 11:53.877
and I just thought
it best

11:53.920 --> 11:55.251
we_ talk about it
In person.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.461
Okay, well,
I have to just say that

11:57.500 --> 12:01.152
we're not open to changing
the closed adoption.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.269
At this point, it's just, it's--
- Julia...

12:02.300 --> 12:04.439
It's jus--it's been
a hard year for our whole family

12:04.480 --> 12:06.539
and adding this
to it, I--

12:06.580 --> 12:08.923
[social worker]
Joel, Julia, that's not it.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.849
Victor's birth mother gave birth
to a baby girl three days ago.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.822
It's with a different father
than Victor's birth father

12:13.870 --> 12:15.929
but still,
Victor's half-sister.

12:15.970 --> 12:18.382
She's decided that it's best
for her and the child

12:18.420 --> 12:19.864
that she give
the baby up for adoption.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.070
She wanted to give
you the option

12:21.110 --> 12:22.805
to adopt
the baby.

12:27.570 --> 12:31.461
Wow.
Wow.

12:38.030 --> 12:39.918
Victor has a sister.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.895
I mean, where would we
even put another kid?

12:42.930 --> 12:45.967
We--we--we don't have anywhere
to put another kid.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.922
Well, honey, that can't be
a deciding factor.

12:47.970 --> 12:50.518
I mean, I can build
a bedroom anywhere, but--yeah.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.347
Okay, but we can't throw
another curveball at the kids

12:53.390 --> 12:54.937
right now--I mean,
if we were gonna adopt a kid.

12:54.980 --> 12:55.765
Right.
Right, right.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.244
It would not be now.
It would not--

12:57.290 --> 12:58.837
No, no. We have
to work on us.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.835
We have to
work on us.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.279
Yeah.

13:01.330 --> 13:04.561
Okay. So it's
decided then?

13:04.610 --> 13:06.293
It's decided.

13:06.330 --> 13:10.289
All right.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.432
Let's just
give it the weekend.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.505
I think that's best.

13:13.550 --> 13:16.826
[Hank]
It's a big campus. I was a
community college guy.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.896
- Oh, yeah?
- Small campus, yeah.

13:18.930 --> 13:23.583
I left after sophomore.
Figured I'd learn more

13:23.630 --> 13:26.383
traveling and taking pictures
than I ever would

13:26.420 --> 13:28.559
going to school,
you know?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.522
I'm not saying--
- So drop out?

13:30.560 --> 13:31.629
No, no, no, no,
I'm saying for me.

13:31.670 --> 13:34.457
That was just
for me.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.879
- So, um...
- All right, look, Drew.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.320
Here's the thing.
I, uh,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.129
Any.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.957
I don't got any.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.639
I don't know
what it is exactly

13:47.680 --> 13:49.614
but I'm
working on that.

13:49.650 --> 13:52.301
You, uh, you know,
we're not that close

13:52.340 --> 13:54.342
but we got to
know each other and--and--

13:54.380 --> 13:55.654
and I like you,
you know?

13:55.690 --> 13:57.271
You don't say much
and when you do

13:57.310 --> 13:58.652
you talk very low and
then--then--and--

13:58.690 --> 14:00.385
and I kind of
like that.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.627
Thank you, Hank.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.049
Um, I mean we kind of
identify with each other

14:05.080 --> 14:07.071
_ and I was
just wonderIng,

14:07.120 --> 14:11.079
wanna be my best man
at this thing?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.326
Yeah--at the wedding?

14:12.360 --> 14:13.918
Yeah. Yeah,
at the wedding.

14:13.950 --> 14:14.917
Yeah, definitely.

14:14.950 --> 14:15.917
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.918
- Oh, great.
- I mean, what does that entail?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.404
Ah, nothing.
You stand there,

14:19.440 --> 14:21.431
you--you gotta
hold the rings,

14:21.480 --> 14:22.674
that's one thing
you gotta do.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.608
I gotta give you these
and you gotta--

14:24.650 --> 14:26.265
- Oh, wow.
- But you gotta hold onto them.

14:26.310 --> 14:27.925
- Oh, okay.
- And not lose them.

14:27.970 --> 14:28.823
You know, make sure
you don't lose them.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.657
Yeah. Thank you
for asking me. That's--

14:30.690 --> 14:32.248
Yeah. Well, I'm
glad you said yes.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.032
I didn't have--you know--
after you was the UPS guy.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.288
- Yeah, of course.
- But, uh...

14:37.320 --> 14:38.526
All right, how do you
wanna wrap this up?

14:38.560 --> 14:40.380
Is this like
a hug thing?

14:40.430 --> 14:41.624
I think so.
Yeah.

14:41.670 --> 14:43.706
Yeah, come on.
Your mother would be mad at me

14:43.740 --> 14:45.150
if I didn't hug you.

14:45.190 --> 14:46.703
All right, Erin, you making
a good burger?

14:46.740 --> 14:47.843
Yeah. Got it.

14:47.880 --> 14:48.676
You gotta flip those
more often. Get a little more--

14:48.710 --> 14:50.120
How's that salad dressing
coming?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.081
It's almost done.

14:51.130 --> 14:52.677
- It looks good, souffle.
- Mr. B? Mr. B?

14:52.710 --> 14:53.642
- Yeah?
- Um, you told me that

14:53.680 --> 14:54.362
you'd show me a better way
to chop onions?

14:54.410 --> 14:56.230
Oh, yes. Yes.
Hey, everybody,

14:56.270 --> 14:57.237
gather around. I'm gonna
show you how to

14:57.270 --> 14:58.646
chop onions
without crying.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.440
Erin, you gotta
watch those burgers.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.334
Those babies are
gonna burn. Okay?

15:01.380 --> 15:03.234
Now this is a top secret
shared by chefs

15:03.280 --> 15:05.168
of Michelin restaurants.
You ready?

15:05.210 --> 15:06.939
- Yep.
- This is what you do.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.621
Get your onions.
Then you need a knife.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.969
All right? And
then the last thing:

15:12.010 --> 15:13.238
onion goggles.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.929
- What?
- What? Those aren't

15:15.980 --> 15:17.140
actually onion goggles.
[laughs]

15:17.190 --> 15:18.282
Well, some people
say they're

15:18.330 --> 15:19.706
[French accent]
swim goggles.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.662
But zees are onion goggles!

15:21.710 --> 15:26.534
And wiz-out them,
we can not attack l'oignon!

15:26.580 --> 15:29.959
[Adam]
You will not make us cry.
No! Not today!

15:29.990 --> 15:32.231
I chop off
your head and your feet.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.237
Go ahead.

15:33.270 --> 15:35.158
- Same way? Uh!
- Yes.

15:35.210 --> 15:37.474
[ ' |
[laughgsl] ]Okay.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.748
Who's crying now?

15:38.790 --> 15:39.484
[both students]
The onions.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.513
The onions
are cryIng now!

15:43.560 --> 15:44.959
Hey.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.001
[girl]
[laughs]
This is a much better way.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.009
[Nick Drake's
Place to Be]

15:58.060 --> 16:00.199
When I was young,
younger than before

16:00.230 --> 16:01.322
Oh, my God.

16:01.370 --> 16:03.156
He looks just like you.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.644
Yeah, I was just gonna
say he's beautiful.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.783
[laughs] Yeah!

16:05.820 --> 16:10.473
[laughs]
Oh, my God. Zeek?

16:10.520 --> 16:12.306
- Yeah.
- Oh, my.

16:12.350 --> 16:13.305
Yeah, she's
doing great.

16:13.350 --> 16:15.033
He's sleeping
too, so--

16:15.070 --> 16:16.241
He does
take after me.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.247
[laughs] Yeah.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.349
Go to nap.

16:18.390 --> 16:21.143
Go to sleep anywhere,
any time.

16:25.190 --> 16:29.593
Have I--have I ever
told you that

16:29.640 --> 16:31.631
you're my favorite?

16:31.680 --> 16:33.739
Dad.
Come on.

16:33.780 --> 16:36.157
I think instinctively
you must know.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.531
- I mean, it's--
- Well, you've gotten away

16:37.580 --> 16:38.535
with everything!

16:38.580 --> 16:40.263
[laughs]
Dad.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.813
You don't have to
say that.

16:41.860 --> 16:42.815
You're my
little girl.

Mm.

married.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.795
Again.

16:48.830 --> 16:52.106
You know, Hank
came to see me

16:52.140 --> 16:54.620
to ask
for my blessing.

16:54.660 --> 16:56.548
Aw, so old-fashioned.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.386
Yeah. Well, he happens
to be the only one

16:58.430 --> 16:59.419
that's done that.

16:59.460 --> 17:00.597
Joel didn't even
do it.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.595
You're kidding!

17:01.640 --> 17:03.153
No, and he did.
He--

17:03.190 --> 17:05.329
he asked for
my blessing.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.464
He respects you, Dad.
He likes you.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.367
And I like him.
I think he's--

17:10.400 --> 17:12.789
I think he's
the guy, Sarah.

17:12.820 --> 17:16.688
You know, I don't think
I would have ever found

17:16.720 --> 17:19.689
him--um--

17:19.720 --> 17:21.278
if you hadn't let
me come home,

17:21.310 --> 17:24.655
stay here for awhile.

17:24.690 --> 17:26.794
It just changed
everything.

17:26.830 --> 17:30.311
Thank you.

17:30.350 --> 17:34.138
Yeah.

17:34.190 --> 17:35.805
Have I been
a good father?

17:35.840 --> 17:40.630
Now I'm weaker
than the palest blue

17:40.680 --> 17:44.320
The very best.

17:44.370 --> 17:49.546
Oh, so weak in
this need for you

18:04.840 --> 18:06.660

Careful.

18:06.700 --> 18:07.667

He's got a little assistant,
I like that.

18:07.700 --> 18:11.329
I like it, Max.

to the right more.

Into the light.
Further, further.

18:13.980 --> 18:15.732
- Don't be so far away.
- Does he come with me or--?

18:15.780 --> 18:16.747
Yes, he should
come with you.

18:16.780 --> 18:18.361
I think--uh--
I think--

18:18.400 --> 18:19.606
I'm not totally
in the light right now.

18:19.650 --> 18:20.912
It doesn't matter.
Nobody cares about you.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.847
It's all about the bride.

18:21.890 --> 18:25.542

Get that, Max.

he gets this.

making out with your baby.

Oh, he's too young for you.

- Honey, give me a hug.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.847
Yeah,yeah,

18:51.880 --> 18:52.915
I know.

You're pretty good
at this, Max.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.949
I learned it
from you.

18:55.990 --> 18:58.675
Yeah, well...

18:58.720 --> 18:59.880
I learned a lot
from you too.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.306
That doesn't
make any sense.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.750

No, no!

Oh, we're getting
our picture taken!

Hey.

19:18.430 --> 19:19.806
Yeah, yeah.
I'm doing okay.

Look at your sister.

19:25.570 --> 19:27.219
[Crosby]
Yeah.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.818
She's so happy.

19:28.850 --> 19:29.817
Yeah.

19:29.850 --> 19:30.817
It's nice.

19:30.850 --> 19:32.363

19:32.410 --> 19:35.231
And I'm really
proud of her.

19:35.270 --> 19:37.579
[sighs]
It's hard for me not to

19:37.620 --> 19:39.372
focus on the fact though
that The Luncheonette

19:39.410 --> 19:42.823
is in the crapper and
I'm going back to punch a clock

19:42.870 --> 19:44.861
next week,
at a studio I hated.

19:44.900 --> 19:45.696
No, wait a minute.
I thought you were

19:45.730 --> 19:47.459
going to stay
with The Luncheonette.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.934
What happened
to that?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.902
Well Adam's out,
he's done.

19:50.940 --> 19:51.668
He'd been wanting
to do it, so--

19:51.700 --> 19:54.806
- Yeah?
- That's--that's that.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.968
So?

19:58.020 --> 20:00.227
I can't do it
without Adam.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.329

20:05.920 --> 20:10.232
you're more than capable
of doing this.

talk to you.

20:25.010 --> 20:25.829

20:25.870 --> 20:27.497
I'm the official

20:27.530 --> 20:28.872
Uh, yeah, and
I'm your sister

20:28.910 --> 20:29.945
and I never get
to see you

20:29.980 --> 20:32.323
and I wanna
talk to you.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.918
Okay, I have
a very short window.

20:33.950 --> 20:35.463
Great.

20:35.510 --> 20:37.910
You know, it has
been really weird for me

20:37.960 --> 20:40.428
to not be, like,
in the same house as you.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.981
I miss you.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.749
Can you look
at me?

20:44.790 --> 20:46.781
Yes.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.786
It would have
been really easy for me

20:48.830 --> 20:50.798
to, like, grow up
and resent you

20:50.830 --> 20:54.345
for being
a drama queen

20:54.390 --> 20:56.381
and, like, hogging
all of Mom and Dad's attention

20:56.420 --> 20:57.796
and I just
realized now

20:57.840 --> 20:59.933
that I was
totally wrong

20:59.980 --> 21:02.869
and I am a much better person
for being your sister

21:02.910 --> 21:05.322
and I think
you're special and cool

21:05.360 --> 21:08.295

and wonderful

21:11.330 --> 21:12.774

are contradIctory.

at the same time.

21:14.060 --> 21:17.814
I think you are both
at the same time.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.646

with this giant camera?

21:19.690 --> 21:20.645
We can not take
a seler.

my industry.

Can we please?
I'll do it.

21:22.760 --> 21:23.852
I'll just probably break it.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.924
You can't touch
my camera.

can do it then.

and--

27:08.170 --> 27:09.683
I was thinking about
taking Zeek down

27:09.730 --> 27:13.200
to Golden Gate Park
and teaching him how to

27:13.250 --> 27:16.868
play baseball.
You know?

27:16.910 --> 27:20.801
Wait, what--
what are you guys suggesting?

27:23.260 --> 27:27.253

come live with us, Amber.

Oh, guys, no,
I couldn't--

27:39.310 --> 27:41.301
I couldn't do that to you.

big third act!

any semblance of peace

talked about it and...

27:53.320 --> 27:58.906

want this to be our third act.

I wanna talk to you
about something.

28:33.850 --> 28:35.420
Pretty sure that
you're gonna think

28:35.470 --> 28:38.849
it's a terrible idea
and you'll probably have

28:38.880 --> 28:40.916
30 really smart reasons
why it is but, um--

open...on my own.

28:48.930 --> 28:50.022

I could rent out

the office space,

28:51.550 --> 28:53.165
and the extra studios,

collect a little rent and
then keep the downstaIrs

28:55.420 --> 28:59.789
for myself and then, you know,
if things come back,

28:59.840 --> 29:01.034
maybe I'll take over
the whole shop again

29:01.080 --> 29:02.763
but until then it
seems lIke maybe

29:02.810 --> 29:06.257
