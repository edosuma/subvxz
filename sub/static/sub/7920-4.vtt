00:02.536 --> 00:04.303
Opening statements today
in the trial

00:04.305 --> 00:07.106
of celebrity chef Susanna Gabey,
accused of killing her husband.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.807
The special tonight:

00:08.809 --> 00:10.776
cold-blooded murder.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.612
The jury is expected
to be sequestered for weeks.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.947
Ooh, look, that's her.

In otter news,
an otter was born

00:21.122 --> 00:23.455
at the zoo today. Oh! Oh, dip.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.124
I can't believe Jess
is gonna be sequestered

00:25.126 --> 00:26.525
for so long.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.727
Who am I supposed to go to
for lady advice now?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.462
I mean, I'm having

00:30.464 --> 00:32.731
a real crisis with KC.
NICK: It's not a crisis.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.967
She posted a photo of
another dude; it's no big deal.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.568
Yeah, but when
I asked her about it, she said,

00:36.570 --> 00:39.238
"He's a work friend, Winston.
Slow down."

00:39.240 --> 00:40.639
I'm like, "Slow down?

00:40.641 --> 00:42.307
"We've been dating
for four months already.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.742
I've seen one of your breasts."

00:43.744 --> 00:44.977
What was the situation
where you only saw

00:44.979 --> 00:45.978
one of her breasts?

00:45.980 --> 00:47.146
We were playing dinosaur.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.313
Look, I just need Jess.

00:48.315 --> 00:49.581
Winston, it's gonna be okay,

00:49.583 --> 00:50.816
because I can help.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.317
I told Jess that I was gonna

00:52.319 --> 00:53.986
take care of her boys
while she was away.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.655
What, you don't think
I can be supportive?

00:56.657 --> 00:57.823
(phone chimes)

00:57.825 --> 00:59.158
No...

00:59.160 --> 01:00.426
Todd is in town.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.161
Ploons?
Are you kidding me?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.996
Went to college
with this guy.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.164
He's the worst guy
on Planet Earth.

How much are you guys
gettin' paid for this?

01:19.013 --> 01:20.345
Bunch of marijuana.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.114
And these carrots.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.348
(phone chimes)
Ugh.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.616
I just got a text from him.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.552
"Nick the Dick"-- hate that--

01:26.554 --> 01:28.387
"it's Hot Daddy T"-- hate that--

01:33.527 --> 01:35.127
Vegas... question..."

01:35.129 --> 01:36.895
He spelled "Vegas"
with two S's.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.964
He spelled it with two?

01:38.966 --> 01:40.632
That's ass. That's Veg-ass.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.367
You see what he did?

01:42.369 --> 01:43.635
You see
what he did?

01:43.637 --> 01:44.703
It's so like Ploons

01:44.705 --> 01:46.371
to assume he's coming

01:46.373 --> 01:48.040
to the bachelors party.
He said Vegas?

01:48.042 --> 01:49.374
You can't invite him, Schmidt.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.809
On the other hand, you know,
a bachelor party

01:50.811 --> 01:51.810
does cost a lot of money.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.712
I'm your best man.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.148
I got this bachelors party
under control, buddy.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.416
First of all,
you're saying

01:57.418 --> 01:58.550
<i> "bachelors</i> party,"
which is wrong.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.751
Okay, so where we going?

01:59.753 --> 02:01.053
Where are we going?
Yeah.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.322
For the party?
For the party, yeah.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.424
We don't have to go anywhere.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.725
You want to go somewhere, right?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.160
Uh... NICK: We're
going someplace.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.062
Someplace that is
so much better

02:10.064 --> 02:11.763
than what Ploons
could do.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.298
Well, he'd go to Vegas, which...
which sounds awesome.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.400
We're going to Tokyo!

02:18.072 --> 02:19.505
I mean, look at you.
You're obsessed

02:19.507 --> 02:21.473
with Japanese culture,
you wear the kimono, right?

02:25.279 --> 02:26.979
I'm gonna take you where Ploons
can never take you.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.347
I'm taking you to Tokyo.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.848
(choked up):
This... this is pimp.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.951
This is so pimp.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.786
(crying): I just really
need to know, um...

02:34.788 --> 02:36.355
(clears throat)

02:36.357 --> 02:38.590
I was gonna say, how are we
paying for all of this?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.526
Doesn't matter. How does
anybody pay for anything?

02:40.528 --> 02:41.793
WINSTON:
No, no, seriously,

02:41.795 --> 02:44.029
how are we paying for this?
Boom, boom, boom...

02:44.031 --> 02:46.131
(imitates playing guitar)
Who cares? We're going to Tokyo!

Is there a three-prong

03:14.995 --> 03:17.162

03:24.838 --> 03:26.371
Hey, there's a stranger

03:26.373 --> 03:28.574
That's just Brandon.
Who the hell is Brandon?

03:28.576 --> 03:30.175
Brandon's how we're paying
for Tokyo, Schmidt.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.077
You see, I put
a thing online.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.712
I'm renting out
Jess's room while she's gone.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.480
Oh... I'm gonna rent
out all the rooms.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.748
Are you insane?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.083
I don't think so, no.

Do you have any idea

03:39.353 --> 03:40.686
the amount of bodily fluids

03:40.688 --> 03:42.054

Brandon's a really good guy.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.256
He's just here

03:44.258 --> 03:45.891
I appreciate the effort, I do,

03:45.893 --> 03:47.159
but we don't need to go to...

03:47.161 --> 03:48.427
we don't need to go to Tokyo.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.362
Not for this.
I'm not willing

03:50.364 --> 03:51.830
to turn our home
into a public pool.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.999
One: I understand your concern,

03:54.001 --> 03:56.268
and I'll make note of it.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.703
You're not even typing.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.037
Two:
I already bought the tickets,

03:59.039 --> 04:00.272
and they're nonrefundable.

We need to come up with $9,000.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.211
You don't need Jess's bowl
of advice, Winston, all right?

04:06.213 --> 04:07.579
I really do, Cece.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.614
I mean, look.
She's cheating on me.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.616
KC's cheating on me.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.918
Hmm. The same thing
happened with Daisy.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.354
Everything's all good,
then all of a sudden,

04:15.356 --> 04:16.788
she's hiding a basketball
player in the shower

04:16.790 --> 04:18.056
and I own a cat!

04:18.058 --> 04:19.625
I'm in a cycle.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.026
I'm in a bad woman cycle.

you post a picture
with a hot girl.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.766
That-that's great.
That's perfect advice, Cece.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.900
I know. Thank you very much.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.035
You're welcome.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.237
If only I knew
a hot girl.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.306
Hmm.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.277
Ah...

04:38.279 --> 04:39.378
Trust me, it'll work.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.746
I've done the math,

04:40.748 --> 04:42.314
and if we rent out
every room for a month,

04:42.316 --> 04:43.615
we'll have enough money,
we won't need Todd.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.051
The hospitality industry
is fast-paced

04:46.053 --> 04:47.286
and it's detail-oriented.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.820
And you have the focus

04:48.822 --> 04:50.555
of a coked-up Italian
on a summer day.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.424
I'm very focused.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.725
You're not even looking
at me right now.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.960
I thought I saw
something shiny.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.895
Um...

04:56.897 --> 04:58.497
But no, it was nothing.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.265
How do you drive your car
and not hit people?

05:00.267 --> 05:01.733
I have never been
more focused in my--

05:01.735 --> 05:02.968
It was a spoon.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.936
I saw the...
it was just a spoon.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.271
Nick, let's just
call Todd.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.939
Let's bite
the bullet...

05:07.941 --> 05:09.775
No, Schmidt, we don't need
his money. Look at me.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.842
(sighs)
Okay...

05:10.844 --> 05:12.110
Schmidty, I'm your best man.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.812
And I may not be a rich man.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.480
The only thing
my parents invented

05:15.482 --> 05:17.482
was a wand

05:17.484 --> 05:19.184
to push the buttons on
the microwave from the table,

05:19.186 --> 05:20.619
so you don't have to get up.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.788
You mean like a stick?
My point is,

05:22.790 --> 05:24.589
it's my job to give you

05:24.591 --> 05:27.092
the bachelors party
of your dreams.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.361
And I intend
on doing that.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.629
Why don't you close
your eyes for me?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.197
What do you see

05:32.199 --> 05:33.832
when you see your dream
bachelors party?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.600
Sushi. (chuckles) A lot of it.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.035
Sake.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.704
Honor.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.871
And no Todd, right?

05:39.873 --> 05:40.972
Look around. Is Todd there?

05:40.974 --> 05:42.474
'Cause we don't need him.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.942
We can do this.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.944
I want you to look at me

05:45.946 --> 05:47.312
and tell me you believe
we can do this.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.313
Do you believe, Schmidty?

05:48.315 --> 05:50.649
Do you believe?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.884
Schmidty?
Do you believe?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.319
I believe!
Do you believe?

05:54.321 --> 05:55.954
I believe!
Yeah!

05:55.956 --> 05:58.623
I'm gonna eat sushi
off my own ass!

06:03.964 --> 06:04.963
That's just gonna slow me down.
Why you using tongs?

06:04.965 --> 06:05.997
We don't use
tongs at home.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.132
Don't forget to write
your reviews,

06:07.134 --> 06:08.900
and it'd be nice if
you mentioned Nick.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.276
So you're just full-blown
running a hotel now?

06:10.302 --> 06:11.336
MAN: All right, let's go.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.571
It's a boutique hotel, yes.

So grab a vacuum...
I'm gonna go take my 15.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.416
It's not time for a break.
You just started working.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.751

how do you work...?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.353
(phone ringing)
Look at that.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.188
KC took the bait.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.890
I gotta take my 15.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.092
Uh, hello?
What it do, Jacques?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.594
Everybody's taking their 15.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.863

07:29.817 --> 07:31.149
Um...

07:31.151 --> 07:32.284
I'm sorry.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.385
You okay?

07:33.387 --> 07:34.419
Yeah.

07:34.421 --> 07:37.489
(loud continuous sob)

07:42.763 --> 07:43.929
(sob winds down)

07:43.931 --> 07:46.498
(sob resumes)

07:46.500 --> 07:47.833
This is your fault.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.835
I need Jess.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.770
No, you know what, no, you don't
need, you don't need Jess.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.605
'Cause I'm here,
and I've got this.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.074
So what can I do
that's Jess-like?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.576
You want some,
you want some tea?

07:57.578 --> 08:01.079
You want, like, cupcakes or a cute song?
I need Jess.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.647
Um, okay, you know what,
I'm gonna do the tea thing.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.483
How about I do
the tea thing for you,

08:04.485 --> 08:06.084
and then I'll, it'll
soothe you, okay?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.152
So, how do I,
how do you make tea?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.420
How do you make tea?!
I'll fig...

08:08.422 --> 08:09.955
I'll figure it out.
I'll just get some water

08:09.957 --> 08:11.156
and I'll ta...
Yeah.

08:11.158 --> 08:11.957
You know, it's...

08:11.959 --> 08:13.658
Water and leaves!

08:13.660 --> 08:15.460
Water and leaves!
Water and leaves.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.662
So, this is hot,
and this is cold.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.965
Yes.
(chuckles)

08:19.967 --> 08:22.434
Wet down there.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.706
Wet down there.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.476
Oh, I don't need
to know that, Kumiko.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.612
That is,
that is not my business.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.980
Wet down there!

08:34.982 --> 08:37.482
Oh, you mean down there!
Yeah...

08:37.484 --> 08:39.184
Yes!
That's really...

08:39.186 --> 08:40.685
(groans)
Yes, that's, yeah,

08:40.687 --> 08:42.153
that's actually, yeah.
Let me get in the drain.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.489
Sorry about that glass.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.624
(chuckles)

08:45.626 --> 08:47.025
I was in a zone writing,
and I just...

08:47.027 --> 08:48.727
It's just a glass, right?
Yeah.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.395
As a reminder,

08:50.397 --> 08:52.197
there are some plastic
disposable cups,

08:52.199 --> 08:53.798
literally right there,
so there's no need

08:53.800 --> 08:56.001
to rummage through the cabinets
with your travelers' hands.

08:56.003 --> 08:56.902
Okay.
Okay.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.069
But how's the novel coming?

08:58.071 --> 09:00.238
Oh, I mean,
I'm stuck on a love scene.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.140
Ain't that always the case?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.508
Couldn't imagine.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.143
Listen to this.
What?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.511
"As his electric car
powered down,

09:06.513 --> 09:07.646
the first thing
he saw was..."

09:07.648 --> 09:09.014
No, look at me.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.215
Look at me.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.583
Do I have to?
Yeah.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.653
"...first thing he saw was
her virgin breasts glowing

09:14.655 --> 09:15.987
"in the Alabama moonlight.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.522
"She said,

09:17.524 --> 09:19.157
"'Which one do you want to see?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.759
"The left or the right?'

09:20.761 --> 09:22.227
"And I said, 'Both.'

09:22.229 --> 09:24.663
"She said, 'No, pick one.'

09:24.665 --> 09:26.831
"So I said, 'Left.'

09:26.833 --> 09:27.933
"She finally showed him,

09:27.935 --> 09:29.701
"and it was as big
as a Cadillac.

09:29.703 --> 09:33.872
"She grabbed him by the potatoes
and led him up the stairs.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.407
"So many stairs.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.510
"Left, right, left,

09:38.512 --> 09:41.112
"right, left,

09:41.114 --> 09:42.347
"right.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.549
He grabbed the banister
and then let go."

09:44.551 --> 09:46.184
Oh, that's erotic stuff.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.285
Oh, thank you.
You're very welcome.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.553
That's very sexy stuff
you're writing.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.388
Thanks.
The sexiest, really.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.523
Where the hell have you been?

09:51.525 --> 09:52.724
"The parakeet
was still in the room,

09:52.726 --> 09:55.860
"but it turned out to be
a welcome addition

09:55.862 --> 09:58.496
to the games at hand."

09:59.132 --> 10:00.532
Lose that one?

10:00.534 --> 10:02.200
I don't even get that one.
I didn't get that one.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.069
Let go of it.
I have no emotional connection.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.371
You're cracking; take your 15.
I'm not cracking.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.772
Oh!

10:07.774 --> 10:08.640
Nuts.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.041
You weak-handed moron!
Hey!

10:10.043 --> 10:13.278
Who also is
our cherished guest here.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.613
It's just the weight of it.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.082
The liquid and the balance
of it... I'm so sorry.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.717
I'll help clean it up.
No, please, let me clean it up.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.818
You keep writing.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.752
(clicks tongue)

10:20.754 --> 10:21.886
I think you're cracking.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.321
You need to take your 15.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.056
I don't need a 15; I'm gonna
take a 15 more of work.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.257
You need a 15; take a 15.
Pull it together.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.492
I will not take a 15
ever again in my whole life.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.127
I'm so sorry about this.
Take a 15.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.795
"She took a 15 on my face."

10:32.599 --> 10:33.732
Focus.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.301
Focus!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.235
NICK:<i> Sorry about</i>
<i> the little misunderstanding</i>

10:37.237 --> 10:38.236
<i> there, all right?</i>

10:38.238 --> 10:39.971
(chuckles)

10:39.973 --> 10:42.474
(speaking Japanese):

10:47.814 --> 10:49.414
(giggles)

10:49.416 --> 10:51.282
Is this oolong tea?
Yeah.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.817
Yeah, well, Jess never
gives me caffeine.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.986
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.755
You know, this breakup has
got me going crazy, Cece.

10:56.757 --> 10:57.956
So you just need
to calm down, okay?

10:57.958 --> 10:58.990
I'm gonna need you
to nurture me.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.291
I'm gonna
need you to nurture me.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.327
Okay, all right, I can do
that part. Here we go.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.995
So, um, maybe this breakup

11:03.997 --> 11:06.264
isn't such a bad thing.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.166
Mm-hmm. Now you can stop wasting
your life and find someone

11:08.168 --> 11:10.835
more realistic.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.470
Yeah, someone who's, like,
in your league.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.805
What? Because you don't
want to die alone,

11:13.807 --> 11:15.473
so you kind of have to settle

11:15.475 --> 11:16.841
and lower your standards

11:16.843 --> 11:19.010
and find someone that's just,
like, in your lane.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.045
What...?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.346
If you stay in your lane,

11:21.348 --> 11:23.348
you'll be happy,
'cause you won't be alone.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.516
Right?
What are you saying?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.785
Someone a little older, dumpier.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.119
(crying):
You are so bad at this.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.521
For crying out loud.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.555
Who do we give our laundry to?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.657
The ad said
it was included.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.025
I suppose,
I suppose me, uh, I guess.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.393
Here you go.
Oh, dear Lord.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.828
Where do the entertainment
types tend to hang out?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.396
Crystal is a performer.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.031
We'd love to get her in front
of the right set of eyes.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.133
This is all underpants.
Showtime!

11:42.135 --> 11:43.835
Mm... No, oh, no, no.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.036
Crystal!

11:45.038 --> 11:46.071
SCHMIDT:
Oh, no.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.672
No, no, no, no, honey,
no acting.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.841
I feel that you're gonna start
a monologue of some sort,

11:49.843 --> 11:51.509
and I really don't want
to hear it. I have no tolerance.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.877
Please, I'm begging you.
(clears throat)

11:52.879 --> 11:54.713
Is that your moment before?
Please don't do that.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.914
You don't know what
out of order is,

11:55.916 --> 11:58.316
What the hell?
Mr. Trask!

11:58.318 --> 12:01.252
If I were the man I was
five years ago,

12:01.254 --> 12:04.089
I'd take a flame thrower
to this place!

12:04.091 --> 12:05.323
Pacino,<i> Scent of a Woman.</i>

12:05.325 --> 12:06.491
I got the referen--

12:06.493 --> 12:08.259
Wait a minute.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.061
Is that my cashmere
window pane blazer?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.529
I know it was you, Fredo.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.331
You broke my heart.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.699
Do you only do Pacino?
(kisses)

12:14.701 --> 12:15.900
You knock him down.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.736
Why don't you try
knockin' me down now?

12:17.738 --> 12:18.903
<i>Rocky V?</i>

12:18.905 --> 12:20.071
No, no, in the ring.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.107
Tommy Gunn only fights
in the ring.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.775
Of all the<i> Rockys?</i>

12:23.777 --> 12:25.243
Baby, let's do the cop one.
Do<i> Heat.</i>

12:25.245 --> 12:26.911
Don't do<i> Heat.</i> I'm... Oh, God.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.847
'Cause she's got a great ass!

12:34.621 --> 12:36.521
Nickolo.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.123
What up, my man?

12:38.125 --> 12:40.091
You got a weird vibe
right now, bud.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.226
I called Todd.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.595
W-W... You just say,
"Hi, what's up?

12:43.597 --> 12:44.929
No. Don't come to the
bachelor party."

12:44.931 --> 12:46.464
No, I made plans with him.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.933
I'm gonna invite him
and ask him to pay.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.635
What?! You...
I'm sorry!

12:50.637 --> 12:52.203
♪ I hear the blues a-callin' ♪

12:52.205 --> 12:55.306
♪ Tossed salad
and scrambled eggs ♪

12:55.308 --> 12:56.908
Is she listening
to<i> Frasier</i> reruns?

12:56.910 --> 12:57.976
I'm in the middle
of a fight with you.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.210
There's this one episode, right?

12:59.212 --> 13:00.311
Where Niles,

13:00.313 --> 13:02.747
he's making
an origami flower,

13:02.749 --> 13:04.716
and Frasier comes in and asks...

13:04.718 --> 13:07.085
Well, I'm sorry, actually, it's
Daphne that comes in and asks...

13:07.087 --> 13:08.219
Why'd you invite Todd?!

13:08.221 --> 13:10.221
Is that what Daphne asks?

13:10.223 --> 13:13.224
'Cause if I'm Daphne,
that's what I'm asking.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.260
He sucks.
I could've done it!

13:15.262 --> 13:16.561
Then what does, uh, Frasier say?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.263
You would never be Frasier
in this scenario.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.098
Who would I be?
Obviously the dad,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.599
the lazy piece of dump

13:21.601 --> 13:24.836
that sits on the chair.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.507
And you just broke my heart.
(Kumiko giggles)

13:34.114 --> 13:35.113
CECE:<i> Well, the McQuaids</i>
<i> sure left a mess.</i>

13:35.115 --> 13:36.347
WINSTON: Nick, I would
just like to say

13:36.349 --> 13:38.116
that you had a vision
for this hotel.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.919
I'd also like to say
that I may die alone.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.520
It could happen.
Yeah.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.489
Be nice if you surprised us.
I'll try.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.624
Okay, look, Nick, I'm sorry
that I called Todd.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.927
You can suck Todd's gas
till you're blue in the face,

13:48.929 --> 13:49.761
but I won't.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.329
Not now, not ever.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.698
I'll pay my own way to Tokyo,

13:53.700 --> 13:54.766
'cause he hotel's
still open, so...

13:54.768 --> 13:55.867
Kumiko seems happy.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.268
You could get some money
back from her.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.469
Yeah. I ca--

13:58.471 --> 14:00.004
I'm not gonna charge her;
I can't charge her.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.639
What?
Why wouldn't you charge her?

14:01.641 --> 14:02.674
Why can't you charge Kumiko?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.811
To be honest, because we had
a sexual encounter.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.645
There we go.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.947
Shame, shame.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.215
SCHMIDT:
I knew it, Nick!

14:10.217 --> 14:12.183
You weren't in the bathroom
fixing the shower.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.285
You were showing her
the business center.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.187
Okay, in my defense,
it wasn't in the shower.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.723
It was in the hallway
for a few moments.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.492
Don't refer to it
as a hallway. Yuck.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.961
I literally meant the hallway.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.996
And it was vibrant, if that's
a word you could use

14:24.998 --> 14:26.865
in this situation, 'cause that's
what it was; it was like--

14:26.867 --> 14:29.634
Just admit it, Nick, you screwed up.
I did not screw up!

14:29.636 --> 14:31.302
Well, you certainly
can't charge her now.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.637
Yes, I can.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.405
Sure I can.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.310
Hey, Kumiko.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.914
Can I have a minute
of your time?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.249
(grunts)

14:45.886 --> 14:47.585
(sighs deeply)
I had a...

14:47.587 --> 14:50.054
I enjoyed
our special time today.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.090
I haven't taken my pants off
in front of a woman

14:52.092 --> 14:53.524
in quite some time.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.859
I'm sorry that the
pretzel fell out.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.161
That was unexpected.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.931
I honestly don't know how long
it was in my underpants,

14:59.933 --> 15:01.733
and that was disturbing to me.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.002
Thank you for not
overreacting to it.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.671
I'm here to talk about money.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.106
American currency.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.408
Our special time

15:10.410 --> 15:14.279
was not included, financially,
in the room rate.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.680
'Cause I'm running
a business.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.615
And I can't be soft here.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.385
I understand.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.954
I give you money.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.622
Thank you for being so cool!
That's what-- Yes.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.090
You are prostitute.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.395
Working boy.
No, no.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.097
I want sex.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.232
You want sex.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.868
But need money.

15:36.870 --> 15:39.203
Prostitute.
Hotel owner.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.873
Sorry, Winston, I mean,
this is all my fault.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.474
No, no, no, no, no.
No, Cece, you're fine.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.710
You were right.
You really were.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.379
I mean, KC and I were,
we weren't going anywhere.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.114
Let's be honest.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.116
I just want to find somebody,
Cece; I really do.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.885
So bad it hurts.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.987
From my head to my turd pipe.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.623
That's... sweet.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.491
I got so much
love to give, Cece.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.828
I really do, so why am I
always on the phone,

16:03.830 --> 16:06.931
getting dumped, crying
my eyes out like an idiot?

16:06.933 --> 16:09.334
Well, there must be
something that you can do.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.235
Well, you know, if Jess
were here, she would tell me to:

16:11.237 --> 16:12.904
(imitating Jess): "Just believe
in yourself, Winston,

16:12.906 --> 16:15.473
and, like, be positive."

16:15.475 --> 16:17.175
Well, forget what Jess would say

16:17.177 --> 16:19.844
and forget what I would say.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.180
What do you think
would really

16:22.182 --> 16:23.314
break the cycle?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.682
I just want,
for once in my life,

16:24.684 --> 16:26.484
for someone to cry over me.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.952
Right, okay, explore that.

16:27.954 --> 16:31.422
Somebody to just cry
because of...

16:31.424 --> 16:33.524
That's a great idea, Cece!

16:33.526 --> 16:34.659
It is?
Yes!

16:34.661 --> 16:36.127
This is what I'm gonna do.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.930
We're gonna make KC cry over me.

16:38.932 --> 16:39.964
Oh!

16:39.966 --> 16:41.466
Oh, no, no, that's not,

16:41.468 --> 16:42.867
that's not where
I thought you were going--

16:42.869 --> 16:44.535
We're gonna make
a girl cry today!

16:54.447 --> 16:56.047
Couldn't take the money?

16:57.984 --> 17:00.118
Thought you were a prostitute?

17:00.120 --> 17:03.554
(wry laugh)

17:03.556 --> 17:05.223
It's time for Todd.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.794
Yeah, okay.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.596
All right.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.535
You ever taken
gloves off before?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.408
We could've paid for Tokyo,

17:23.410 --> 17:24.842
but a business venture
went south and ultimately,

17:24.844 --> 17:27.545
it was my fault because
the company was my baby.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.147
I can't believe you guys
have never been to Tokyo.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.882
I've been there 28 times!

17:30.884 --> 17:32.250
Where do you guys
get your sneakers?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.518
28 times?
Yes.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.752
And you idiots
couldn't even

17:34.754 --> 17:35.987
figure out how to
get there once?

17:35.989 --> 17:37.255
Ha! You know what you

17:37.257 --> 17:38.656
deserve for that, Nick?
What?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.191
You deserve a one-nut slap,
my friend.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.759
You're not slapping
one of my nuts, Todd.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.027
Oh, yes, I am.
I'm an adult man.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.896
Tokyo?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.998
Get that leg up, come on.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.174
All right.
Get that nut!

17:56.176 --> 17:58.376
This is for you, best man.
We're going to Tokyo.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.410
Yeah, get it up there.
Here we go.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.611
Ooh...
Okay, no!

18:00.613 --> 18:01.846
S-Stop it!
What!?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.247
Get your hand out of here! Oh!

18:03.249 --> 18:04.549
You're not slapping
anybody's nuts.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.550
Boo!

18:05.552 --> 18:07.218
SCHMIDT: We don't need
your money, Todd.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.855
I'm gonna love my bachelor
party, no matter what.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.291
You're my best man.
We're gonna do this.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.393
Yeah, we can do this.
Do it anywhere we want to do it.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.394
That's right.
It doesn't matter.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.696
NICK: I do, however,
still owe $9,000.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.299
Wow.
You guys are good friends.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.366
Yep.
Yeah.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.801
I don't have any friends.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.236
No one likes me.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.071
Ooh, why would you
say that, Todd?

18:27.073 --> 18:28.639
I have a terrible personality.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.640
True.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.976
(sobs quietly)

18:31.978 --> 18:34.712
You're fake crying, aren't you?
No I'm not! I'm...

18:34.714 --> 18:36.214
Yeah, all right,
you guys caught me.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.051
(choking)

18:40.053 --> 18:41.819
I see it in your mouth.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.125
Look, there she is.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.060
Hey, Winston, I am not
doing this, all right?

18:49.062 --> 18:51.429
It is the worst idea
that I have ever heard.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.964
Uh, remember
when you said,

18:52.966 --> 18:54.966
"I'm Cece.
I'm super supportive"?

18:54.968 --> 18:56.667
Now's your
time to shine.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.169
Yes, it isn't like
a blank check, though.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.838
This idea does not deserve
to be supported,

19:00.840 --> 19:02.173
because it's insane.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.407
Yeah, that's what
I need, Cece!

19:03.409 --> 19:04.976
I need insane!

19:04.978 --> 19:06.911
Look, Cece,

19:06.913 --> 19:09.447
it's no big deal,
but I need this more

19:09.449 --> 19:12.116
than I've needed anything
in my entire life.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.919
(groaning):
I don't want to...

19:14.921 --> 19:17.155
CECE:
<i> KC, um...</i>

19:17.157 --> 19:18.689
I really...

19:18.691 --> 19:21.626
wish I didn't have to be
the one to tell you this,

19:21.628 --> 19:23.961
but Winston is

19:23.963 --> 19:25.963
dead.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.298
Wait, what?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.166
Yeah, uh...

19:28.168 --> 19:29.800
Oh, my God!

19:29.802 --> 19:30.935
Uh, yeah, he...

19:30.937 --> 19:32.203
Oh, my God!

19:32.205 --> 19:34.505
You okay, babe?
No!

19:34.507 --> 19:36.440
Oh, the...?

19:37.343 --> 19:38.709
So you were...?

19:40.480 --> 19:43.181
Well, then, um, KC,

19:43.183 --> 19:45.183
you should know

19:45.185 --> 19:47.185
that Winston's last words,

19:47.187 --> 19:49.887
right before the truck...

19:49.889 --> 19:51.989
Oh.
hit him...

19:51.991 --> 19:54.892
were, um,
"This is all KC's fault.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.661
"And I wouldn't be dead

19:56.663 --> 19:58.963
if it wasn't for her."

19:58.965 --> 20:01.232
(wailing)

20:04.070 --> 20:05.903
Hah!
(KC screams)

20:05.905 --> 20:07.705
It's me and I'm alive!

20:07.707 --> 20:08.839
He's alive!

20:08.841 --> 20:10.074
Scared this dude.
I know.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.209
What? CECE: Hmm...
WINSTON: Yeah.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.410
What is going on?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.844
Thank you for this, Cece.
I needed this.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.313
Yeah, you're welcome.
This means a lot.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.347
Okay, but--
Winston, I need you,

20:16.349 --> 20:17.348
I need you to go.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.383
Hey, guy from the picture--

20:19.385 --> 20:21.219
Mm-hmm
if that's your real name--

20:21.221 --> 20:22.887
y'all look good together.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.188
We out.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.890
CECE:
(chuckles) Bye.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.892
Wait, who--?
I-I-I--

20:27.894 --> 20:30.428
Oh, my God, that
was so messed up.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.697
You've changed my life, Cece.
Uh-huh.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.899
The cycle is broken!

20:34.901 --> 20:36.234
It's a whole new day.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.902
From now on,

20:37.904 --> 20:39.437
the woman I'm
in a relationship with

20:39.439 --> 20:41.572
is gonna be crying over<i> me!</i>

20:41.574 --> 20:42.940
That shouldn't be
the goal, though.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.275
You know that, right?

20:44.277 --> 20:45.343
I want some ice cream.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.344
Never tell anyone
we did this.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.778
Can we get some ice cream?

20:47.780 --> 20:50.414
SCHMIDT:<i> Well, whose stuff</i>
<i> is all this? Is Jess back?</i>

20:51.551 --> 20:52.717
Oh... (laughs)

20:52.719 --> 20:54.619
Jess, what are you doing here?
Huh! Jess!

20:54.621 --> 20:57.188
(high-pitched):
Hi, Nick. Hi, Schmidt.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.128
Hey, Brandon.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.063
Cool vibe, Brandon.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.331
Is this cute?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.468
Mmm? Polka dots?

21:11.537 --> 21:13.771
Or... don't go anywhere.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.043
Yellow?

21:20.280 --> 21:21.812
Mm-mm.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.315
Wear the stripy one.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.584
Hmm...
I think that

21:26.586 --> 21:27.918
will look nice with
your face and everything.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.020
Yeah.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.158
Yeah.
That's a good one.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.993
That's nice.

21:35.995 --> 21:36.994
NICK:<i> You look pretty today.</i>

21:36.996 --> 21:38.062
BRANDON:<i> Thank you.</i>
