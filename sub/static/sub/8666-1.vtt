01:43.061 --> 01:44.802
<i>She was definitely a turnoff.</i>

01:44.813 --> 01:46.395
<i>Too overt.</i>

01:46.398 --> 01:48.185
<i>Look at her.</i>

01:48.191 --> 01:50.524
<i>Obviously big problems.</i>

01:51.194 --> 01:53.060
<i>I mean, most girls
don't fly through the air</i>

01:53.071 --> 01:54.903
<i>with their skirt
around their waist.</i>

01:55.490 --> 01:58.153
<i>Supergirl at least had
the decency to wear tights.</i>

01:58.744 --> 02:00.576
<i>Not that I read comics.</i>

02:00.579 --> 02:02.536
<i>I'm more the politically,
environmentally correct,</i>

02:02.539 --> 02:04.826
<i>feminist, poetry-reading type.</i>

02:04.833 --> 02:06.495
<i>You know...</i>

02:06.501 --> 02:07.867
<i>boring.</i>

02:10.631 --> 02:12.588
<i>I wonder if she posed
for that painting.</i>

02:14.468 --> 02:15.834
<i>Great perm.</i>

02:16.637 --> 02:17.878
<i>Blond hair.</i>

02:17.888 --> 02:19.470
<i>Obvious bleach job.</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:22.264
<i>Too bad it's six months old.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:24.933
<i>I don't know how she does it.</i>

02:25.270 --> 02:27.478
<i>I mean,
I get airsick on a seesaw.</i>

02:32.444 --> 02:34.231
<i>I guess she's sort of beautiful.</i>

02:36.156 --> 02:38.068
<i>I don't know. Those lips.</i>

02:40.243 --> 02:42.610
<i>You know, lips are supposed
to be a perfect reflection</i>

02:42.621 --> 02:44.954
<i>of another part
of a woman's anatomy.</i>

02:45.999 --> 02:47.786
<i>Not that I'm a lesbian.</i>

02:48.669 --> 02:50.626
<i>Well, maybe I am.</i>

02:51.588 --> 02:52.874
<i>No, definitely not.</i>

02:53.340 --> 02:56.128
<i>I told my mother I was,
just for shock value.</i>

02:56.134 --> 02:58.672
<i>She said, "Fine, just as long
as you don't smoke."</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:02.054
<i>Which, of course,
is my main joy in life.</i>

03:02.057 --> 03:03.844
<i>Probably oral compensation.</i>

03:04.559 --> 03:06.141
<i>I don't think I was breastfed.</i>

03:08.230 --> 03:10.722
<i>I can't imagine
where she came from.</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:13.312
<i>I mean, none of the other kids
that go to my school</i>

03:13.318 --> 03:14.684
<i>are that scangie.</i>

03:18.240 --> 03:20.357
<i>I really wish
we could be friends.</i>

03:37.843 --> 03:39.755
Hey, a dog got hit!
Come on!

03:39.761 --> 03:41.127
What did he say?

03:41.638 --> 03:42.674
A dog.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.517
Ugh. Look.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.531
Someone should just kill it.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.069
It's still breathing.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.282
Oh, God.

04:19.216 --> 04:20.378
You kids pipe down!

04:20.385 --> 04:21.875
Hey, Johnny, wait up.
Wait up.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.426
Principal's office.
Please hold.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.553
Take a seat in there.

04:44.659 --> 04:45.991
It's a stick-on.

04:46.995 --> 04:47.995
See?

04:49.748 --> 04:51.284
I like the ivy.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.659
Well, the cross makes me think
of death, but the ivy is life.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.377
Sort of the tragic
and the hopeful, you know?

05:01.593 --> 05:03.175
What did you do to your hair?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.840
Oh, it's Egyptian.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.887
Cool.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.550
So, what are you busted for?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.431
I gotta keep
a certain grade-point average.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.148
I'm slipping in biology.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.728
Oh, you're one of those
scholarship kids.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.609
You make it sound
like Jerry's Kids.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.278
It's not a disease.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.775
Oh, sorry.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.944
Did it hurt?

05:30.539 --> 05:33.703
Um, no. They used a gun.
It was really quick.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.826
But you've got this wire
running through your nose.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.749
It feels like you have a booger.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.168
Who's the old dude who picks
you up in the pimpmobile?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.632
Oh, it's my dad.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.467
He's having a midlife crisis.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.587
My name's Sylvie Cooper.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.839
So, Cooper,
what did they nail you for?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.643
I phoned in a bomb threat
to KTVM.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.553
Wow.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.020
Yeah, you know that lame guy
who does the editorials?

06:00.026 --> 06:02.439
He said that teenagers
are too hormonally imbalanced

06:02.445 --> 06:04.277
to have driver's licenses.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.273
He said the age should be raised
to 21.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.574
Well, how did they know
it was you?

06:09.703 --> 06:10.784
Wait a sec.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.574
I've seen your dad.
He is that guy.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.457
That jerk on TV who does
those tweaked editorials.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.286
You phoned in a bomb threat
to your own father?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.581
Wow, that's great.

06:23.592 --> 06:24.799
No, I mean it.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.134
I'm gonna break this
to you real slow.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.717
Your dad's an asshole.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.395
I ought to slap you good.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.280
Okay.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.452
You can't put 200 people
out on a sidewalk

06:53.455 --> 06:55.492
just because you
don't like an editorial!

06:58.126 --> 07:00.413
They're trying to get rid of me.
Whose side are you on?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.254
Sylvie, you hurt me.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.042
I didn't mean to.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.135
I'm sorry, Dad.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.602
No more than me.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.691
I.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.234
Hmm?

07:29.908 --> 07:31.570
No more than I.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.325
You're grounded.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.995
You rich fuckhead!

07:41.670 --> 07:42.911
I worked for it!

07:48.677 --> 07:49.963
Hi.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.254
It's nice and cool in here.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.005
Um, I missed my ride.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.016
Think you could you take me
to Olympic and Fairfax?

07:57.644 --> 07:58.725
No.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.638
Just a sec.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.058
Dad, she's my best friend.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.234
So why didn't you think
of that before?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.945
Oh, come on.
Just this once, please?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.780
And then
I'll be grounded forever.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.484
What's her name?

08:18.707 --> 08:20.118
Ivy.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.457
Oh, great.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.999
Good Lord.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.834
Get in.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.299
I get carsick. Do you mind
if I sit in the front?

08:36.640 --> 08:37.640
Sure.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.470
Thanks.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.060
Your name is Ivy.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.502
Is something wrong
with your mouth?

09:08.423 --> 09:10.756
Oh, TMJ. It's stress-related.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.376
It gives you terrible headaches,
makes your jaw stiff.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.752
Almost killed Burt Reynolds.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.301
Oh, do you have to buy condoms,
too?

09:18.308 --> 09:21.051
No, I've gotta get a spermicide
with Nonoxynol-9 in it.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.061
What?

09:22.687 --> 09:23.928
Oh, it's a school project, Dad.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.930
This HIV-positive guy
gave us a talk

09:25.940 --> 09:28.227
about not shooting up
and using condoms.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.102
It's not like we're supposed
to screw around or anything.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.031
Uh, we're supposed to learn
to not be embarrassed, you know?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.320
Don't worry, Dad. We gotta turn
everything in at the end.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.238
Save the receipts.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.508
Shit.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.348
Hey, where have you been?

10:05.355 --> 10:06.687
Oh, grounded.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.651
You lost your boot.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.817
It's my only pair.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.486
Your turn.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.493
No way.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.903
Way.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.074
Forget it.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.830
Are you afraid?

10:25.416 --> 10:26.623
No.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.459
Come on. I won't laugh.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.126
I gotta go.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.758
Hey.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.378
Who cares about
a stupid rope swing anyway?

10:44.561 --> 10:45.972
What's your real name?

10:46.563 --> 10:47.974
I like Ivy.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.564
It sort of gives me the chance
to start over.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.530
It's so beautiful.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.575
Where did you get it?

11:01.578 --> 11:02.739
From my Dad.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.077
He must really love you.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.625
Yeah, he also feels guilty.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.290
I was adopted.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.250
Oh.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.798
See, my biological father
was black.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.212
You can tell by my hair.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.919
My mom is my real mom...

11:21.431 --> 11:23.388
But, you know,
when Darryl married her...

11:23.892 --> 11:25.053
he adopted me.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.301
I'm pretty sure
it was to make her happy.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.599
No, I think he really cares
about you.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.306
My dad didn't want me
anywhere around.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.185
He'd get so pissed
if you tried to talk to him.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.983
He'd throw stuff at me,
like food or spitballs.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.196
Ugh.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.486
Your dad read <i>Hustler?</i>

11:41.993 --> 11:43.609
I don't think so.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.282
Well, one day I went
through his room,

11:45.288 --> 11:46.404
and I found all this stuff,

11:46.414 --> 11:48.997
and he had, like, 500 magazines

11:49.000 --> 11:52.243
of the kind with the chicks
in the high heels,

11:52.253 --> 11:56.167
and, like, they like they look
like they're ready for a... exam.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.586
Sordid. Come on.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.628
Hey, I bet that's why
you look so sexy...

12:02.639 --> 12:04.301
so that your dad
would notice you.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.635
Thank you, Doctor.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.553
- So did it work?
- Nope.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.178
He left anyway.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.892
I tried to commit suicide once.
See?

12:15.902 --> 12:17.484
- Where?
- There.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.728
Used to be a lot worse.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.697
Oh, is my hair thing covered up?

12:23.326 --> 12:24.326
Yeah. Why?

12:24.869 --> 12:25.985
My parents.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.534
I tried to convince them that
it was female pattern balding,

12:29.540 --> 12:32.032
you know, that my hair fell out
in the shape of an eye,

12:32.043 --> 12:33.955
but I don't think
they really bought it.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.625
Whoa.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.549
Um, it's too big.
You can never find anyone.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.889
So, um,
how are you getting home?

12:48.726 --> 12:49.807
Hitch.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.269
Not everybody gets to go home
in a Mercedes.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.229
Maybe I'll see you around.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.850
Uh...

12:59.153 --> 13:01.770
You know, I don't really
have many friends.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.325
Me neither.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.027
Um, well, yeah, any friends.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.285
Yeah. Everybody hates me.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.954
Oh, well,
everybody hates me, too.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.291
Um, so...

13:19.299 --> 13:20.631
Do you want to come over?

13:21.259 --> 13:22.466
Yeah.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.010
We kind of have to be quiet.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.426
My mom sleeps a lot.
She's got emphysema.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.343
Oh.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.261
Yeah, well,
I think it's to get attention.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.679
She spends her life dying.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.269
Do you got any booze?

13:35.273 --> 13:37.890
- No. My dad... glug, glug, glug.
- Oh.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.981
Fred, quiet!

13:38.985 --> 13:40.066
Hi, puppy.

13:40.069 --> 13:44.063
Oh, um, he really only likes me.
It's this weird loyalty thing.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.524
- You home?
- Uh, yeah.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.615
They canceled.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.117
Head Start.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.954
I teach reading a couple nights
a week to some inner city kids.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.288
<i>Fred, no!</i>

13:53.291 --> 13:55.374
Well, that's mighty white
of you.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.163
Watch it.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.128
Wow, this is great.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.634
Shh!

14:10.641 --> 14:11.722
Sorry.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.010
I like pianos.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.563
If I was to kill myself,
I'd like to fall,

14:22.070 --> 14:24.687
just close my eyes
and pretend I was flying.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.815
Yeah, with a big splat
at the end.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.316
Well, you wouldn't feel it.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.657
Yeah, but everybody'd stand
around looking at your insides.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.699
Yeah, well, it's a lot faster
than slashing your wrists.

14:37.502 --> 14:38.993
Who slashed their wrists?

14:41.422 --> 14:43.709
Oh, Ivy, this is my mom Georgie.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.298
Hi there, Georg...

14:45.301 --> 14:47.088
Did she tell you
she slashed her wrists?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.756
Oh, Sylvia.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.016
I'll be right back.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.856
Hand me the Percodan.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.321
You never stop testing, do you?

15:18.835 --> 15:20.997
What kind of girl
is impressed by suicide?

15:22.505 --> 15:23.621
I like her.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.497
She has a hole in her nose.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.090
Yeah, well, a lot of girls do.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.254
Leave it open.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.927
It's supposed to rain tonight.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.549
Then open it wider.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.682
I'd think you'd be embarrassed.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.805
What?

15:40.815 --> 15:43.102
Getting caught lying
all the time.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.693
Did you tell her
you're black, too?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.071
You don't want me
to have any friends, do you?

15:50.074 --> 15:51.736
People you have to lie to
so they like you

15:51.742 --> 15:52.902
aren't worth your friendship.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.199
Look, when I'm gone you...

15:57.457 --> 16:00.074
you can play your music
as loud as you want.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.125
Your dad can turn this room
into a study

16:02.128 --> 16:04.495
with leather chairs
and dead animals on the wall,

16:04.505 --> 16:05.871
but in the meantime,

16:05.882 --> 16:07.965
you are not
gonna hang out with a girl

16:07.967 --> 16:11.836
who has a naked woman
with a sword on her back.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.133
What do you think
that says to the boys?

16:14.140 --> 16:16.473
"Try it, buddy,
and I'll cut your dick off"?

16:20.563 --> 16:21.974
I'm causing a problem,
right?

16:23.649 --> 16:24.856
- It's okay.
- Wait.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.981
Look, I don't think your mom
wants me here right now.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.448
Yeah, well, I want you here,
and she's sick,

16:33.451 --> 16:35.989
and sometimes it makes her act
a little bit crazy.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.744
She just cares about you.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.284
Maybe I'll see you at school.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.210
Do you go to Oakhurst, too?

16:45.213 --> 16:47.079
Um, yeah. She has a scholarship.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.004
I know.
I'm kind of out of place there.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.135
I'm always out of place...

16:55.097 --> 16:56.884
especially here.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.974
Your home is really beautiful.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.093
And Coop's the first girl
I've met in the city

17:01.103 --> 17:02.435
that I can talk to.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.097
She's a good person.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.560
It's blocked.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.821
So where do you live?

17:14.617 --> 17:17.280
Um, well, my aunt gets money
for letting me stay there.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.320
I get the picture.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.952
Here. Let me.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.665
What are you doing?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.915
It was too low.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.211
Try it now.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.877
Aren't you afraid?

17:35.471 --> 17:36.471
Of what?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.381
Catching death.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.516
Oh, Mom.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.723
Energy never dies.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.312
It just changes form.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.601
Yeah, well...

17:48.401 --> 17:50.017
you see if you're
ready to change form

17:50.027 --> 17:51.814
when you're 38 years old.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.778
Well, my mom died
in her forties...

17:59.036 --> 18:00.618
but she was dead
way before that.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.496
She only pretended to be alive.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.451
She was so coked out
all the time,

18:07.461 --> 18:09.123
looking out windows.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.915
Every shadow was a cop
or a dealer she owed.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.919
She was always asking
if I heard noises.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.803
And she flinched
every time I touched her.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.436
Even for a hug.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.950
I bet you drove it with
the top down even in the rain.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.998
Best time.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.296
I hope that when I die...

18:53.841 --> 18:55.833
I'll have owned a sports car...

18:56.719 --> 18:58.301
had a family...

18:59.639 --> 19:00.971
a home.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.141
My mom died an old lady

19:05.144 --> 19:07.261
who never did anything
with the top down.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.565
Well, one day with the top down

19:12.568 --> 19:14.901
is better than a lifetime
in a box.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.242
<i>Groucho said he wouldn't
belong to any club</i>

19:23.245 --> 19:24.736
<i>that would have him as a member.</i>

19:25.289 --> 19:27.702
<i>I know what he meant,
but with Ivy it was different.</i>

19:28.209 --> 19:30.246
<i>Her acceptance didn't make me
think less of her.</i>

19:31.128 --> 19:32.664
<i>It made me think more of me.</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:36.131
<i>At first we just
wandered around, shopped.</i>

19:36.133 --> 19:38.921
<i>We developed an unspoken
division of labor:</i>

19:38.928 --> 19:40.965
<i>She bought, I paid.</i>

19:41.639 --> 19:44.723
<i>I got my first skintight
red leather miniskirt.</i>

19:44.725 --> 19:46.216
<i>Of course, it wasn't for me.</i>

19:52.024 --> 19:54.641
<i>Over the next couple of weeks,
Ivy sort of moved in.</i>

19:55.236 --> 19:56.477
<i>No one seemed to mind.</i>

19:56.487 --> 19:58.979
<i>I guess my parents just got used
to having her around.</i>

19:59.699 --> 20:01.565
<i>Ivy's aunt was in heaven.</i>

20:01.575 --> 20:04.363
<i>She kept the money, we kept Ivy.</i>

20:11.043 --> 20:13.080
<i>Mom really liked her.</i>

20:13.087 --> 20:15.295
<i>I think Ivy's energy
was good for her.</i>

20:16.424 --> 20:18.541
<i>It's true, you know,
what Mom said.</i>

20:18.551 --> 20:20.964
<i>A lot of people think
death is contagious.</i>

20:22.304 --> 20:24.136
<i>Ivy's different.</i>

20:24.140 --> 20:26.052
<i>Pretty phenomenal, really.</i>

20:26.058 --> 20:29.096
<i>I mean, I never knew anyone that
looked that much like a slut.</i>

20:29.687 --> 20:31.679
<i>Here she was, my best friend.</i>

20:36.861 --> 20:38.568
<i>- Ivy?
- Yeah?</i>

20:39.697 --> 20:42.155
I didn't really try
to slash my wrists.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.524
I was trying to go outside,
and...

20:45.703 --> 20:48.616
- It's okay.
- I ran through the glass door.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.046
And Darryl is your real father,
isn't he?

20:58.716 --> 21:00.252
I'm afraid so.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.463
You look more like him.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.050
No offense.

21:07.558 --> 21:08.639
None taken.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.980
My mom's pretty, huh?

21:49.517 --> 21:50.758
Rare, huh?

21:53.562 --> 21:55.019
Pardon?

21:55.022 --> 21:56.684
Well, it's so clear.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.774
I'm freezing my ass off.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.026
Want me to get a jacket for you?

22:03.239 --> 22:04.320
A sweater?

22:07.451 --> 22:08.783
I hear you're having a party.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.402
No, it's just business.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.405
Yeah, Coop told me.

22:13.958 --> 22:17.793
She's looking forward to proving
how hormonally balanced she is.

22:18.629 --> 22:19.836
What are you going to do?

22:22.258 --> 22:25.422
Well, I don't have time
to paint them over.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.386
Don't worry. I'll get lost.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.557
Can you hand me my boots?

22:34.854 --> 22:35.890
Sure.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.192
Um...

22:44.446 --> 22:46.733
Those cost 150 bucks.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.324
Hundred and fifty?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.155
Well, um...

22:56.709 --> 22:58.166
that ought to do it.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.798
You keep the change.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.779
Hello?

23:32.786 --> 23:35.028
Um, no. Coop's not here.
This is her friend.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.121
Jim from Head Start?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.950
I really admire
your guys' dedication.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.206
Um, wait, I'll check.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.251
The 16th?

23:49.803 --> 23:51.169
Yeah, she's free.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.341
No problem.

23:54.308 --> 23:55.890
Okay, great. I'll tell her.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.848
No, I'm writing it down
on her calendar right now.

23:58.854 --> 23:59.970
Okay. Bye.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.147
"Twist on one half-turn."

24:03.776 --> 24:04.776
More.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.485
I'm following directions.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.071
Hey, Dad, I noticed the Percodan
was out of Mom's room.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.465
You got any instant?

24:29.468 --> 24:32.176
Espresso.
Dark bean, healthy bean.

24:32.805 --> 24:33.886
So what's next, Dad,

24:33.889 --> 24:36.097
you confiscate her shoelaces
and belt?

24:36.767 --> 24:38.349
I want my pills back.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.681
Now!

24:41.605 --> 24:42.971
I'll get you one, honey.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.474
I want the goddamn bottle.
They're mine.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.601
Isabelle!

24:49.446 --> 24:50.778
Turn it off.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.950
Mom, he's only trying...

24:55.953 --> 24:57.990
If I wanted to kill myself,
he couldn't stop me.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.581
Ivy, would you take me
to my room, please?

25:20.477 --> 25:21.843
Whoa, whoa.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.058
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Coop.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.110
I don't want to go
to school today.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.780
Let's do something
that'll make my parents cringe.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.452
Come on.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.912
So you're sure you're 21 now?

25:51.550 --> 25:52.586
Twenty-two.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.793
And how old's your friend?

25:55.721 --> 25:57.587
- Thirty.
- Thirty.

25:58.432 --> 26:00.424
God damn, you ladies look fine.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.185
- Could we change the music?
- No.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.647
It helps me concentrate.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.774
Let him concentrate, Ivy.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.439
Yeah, 'cause you're next, honey.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.277
No, thank you.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.487
Oh, come on.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.898
How about a little penis...

26:17.618 --> 26:20.782
that says down the shaft,
"Plan ahead"?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.457
Why does the penis
have to be so little?

26:26.460 --> 26:28.372
It's one of my hottest sellers.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.872
Usually the ladies like 'em
between their breasts.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.342
You sure that's sterile?

26:37.971 --> 26:39.178
You bet.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.474
Come on, Coop.
How about a little artsy one?

26:46.480 --> 26:49.939
It'll be like we're sisters,
like blood sisters.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.184
Yeah, if the infection
didn't kill me, my dad would.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.611
Hello?
I thought you said you were 30.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.650
What's happening?

26:57.199 --> 26:59.407
She's having a little problem
leaving home.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.495
Come on, what's more important,
death or friendship?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.163
Please.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.122
Look, I'm just not the type.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.458
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

27:10.504 --> 27:11.711
Nothing.

27:12.172 --> 27:15.381
Oh, but I am? Low-class?

27:16.468 --> 27:17.925
You rich little bitch,

27:17.928 --> 27:19.920
with your socially
acceptable rebellion.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.549
What am I, just another one of
your inner city charity cases?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.218
Gee, I'm so sorry.

27:27.563 --> 27:28.474
What?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.517
That you don't have
to teach me to read.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.890
Must break your heart.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.189
Fuck you, Ivy.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.073
You know what?
You don't have any class.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.653
As a matter of fact,
you look like a slut.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.790
Coop, wait.

27:52.421 --> 27:53.957
I need 40 bucks to pay this guy.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.580
I don't have any money.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.048
Well, why don't you
just suck his dick?

27:57.050 --> 27:58.541
Maybe he'll give you a deal.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.428
You take American Express?

28:06.435 --> 28:07.435
No.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.482
Goodbye.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.860
I don't think she's 30.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.232
Oh, shut...

28:22.743 --> 28:23.984
Shut up.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.533
Ivy.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.660
One of those bills is a hundred.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.463
This one?

28:38.467 --> 28:39.878
Yeah. I need it back.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.062
I'm sorry.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.402
What about?

29:03.951 --> 29:05.032
I'm the asshole.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.281
Yeah, but you're still
my best friend.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.575
Till death.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.413
That's beautiful.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.745
Get away.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.542
- Oh, my God.
- Yuck.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.417
<i>And the forecast for today,</i>

29:22.427 --> 29:23.838
<i>- tonight and tomorrow...</i>
- Ow.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.679
<i>...in the city and outlying
areas, cool, cool, cool...</i>

29:26.682 --> 29:28.048
Where's the fucking bus?

29:28.058 --> 29:30.892
I don't need no fucking bus.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.931
I don't need no Mercedes.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.351
I'm in charge of my own fate.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.311
<i>Get the hell off the street!</i>

29:40.028 --> 29:41.109
Fuck.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.947
<i>Because the only people
safe there are the drug dealers.</i>

29:43.949 --> 29:45.281
Cosmic.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.365
<i>Whatever happened
to your freedom?</i>

29:46.368 --> 29:47.449
- Fuck, let's get out of here.
<i>- They're armed.</i>

29:47.452 --> 29:49.819
<i>They have more firepower
than the police department.</i>

29:51.415 --> 29:53.532
- Where are you going?
- Home.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.542
Come on.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.460
Carsick.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.578
Thank you.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.954
<i>Well, I'll tell you one thing.</i>

29:59.965 --> 30:02.332
<i>The kids are learning
the metric system here.</i>

30:02.342 --> 30:04.584
<i>Kilos, grams,
that sort of thing.</i>

30:04.594 --> 30:07.462
<i>We're in jail, and we have
put ourselves in jail,</i>

30:08.056 --> 30:10.013
<i>while the people
who should be behind bars</i>

30:10.809 --> 30:12.050
<i>are free on the streets.</i>

30:12.853 --> 30:14.435
<i>This has been</i>
A Piece of My Mind.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.221
I'm Darryl Cooper.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.723
General manager, KTVM.
Thank you.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.021
And we're clear.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.911
Can I get a juice,
a couple aspirin?

31:00.734 --> 31:02.600
<i>I always seem
to be looking at life...</i>

31:03.403 --> 31:05.440
<i>from the wrong side
of the window.</i>

31:43.485 --> 31:46.694
The FBI is gonna forget
about the bomb threat.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.528
They figured it was some kid.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.068
Nobody knows whose.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.031
Do I look older?

32:00.710 --> 32:01.710
What?

32:03.463 --> 32:04.544
This is...

32:07.342 --> 32:09.959
all I have.
I can't start over.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.340
Darryl...

32:12.848 --> 32:15.261
you must own half
the Valley by now.

32:15.809 --> 32:16.925
What do you need a job for?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.346
Is this party gonna help?

32:19.396 --> 32:22.139
They're gonna eat your food,
drink your booze...

32:22.149 --> 32:25.608
and do whatever
they already decided to.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.691
Yeah.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.277
What's really bothering you?

32:35.162 --> 32:36.278
Try it.

32:37.581 --> 32:38.742
Say something.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.043
She promised
she'd never leave me.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.671
Now she can barely breathe
enough to say "I love you."

32:59.311 --> 33:00.973
What am I without her?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.301
Mom!

33:38.308 --> 33:39.549
Sylvie?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.182
What were you doing up there?

33:44.898 --> 33:45.934
Nothing.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.933
Just leave me alone.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.589
Mom.

34:16.429 --> 34:17.429
What?

34:20.934 --> 34:22.219
Nothing.

34:24.728 --> 34:25.889
Honey.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.480
Can't I, like... I mean...

34:35.949 --> 34:37.940
Isn't there anything
that I can do?

34:39.034 --> 34:41.447
Like anything
to make you feel better?

34:42.621 --> 34:43.658
Why?

34:45.208 --> 34:47.199
Because I have a blank spot
in my schedule.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.951
I mean, what do you think?

34:48.962 --> 34:52.000
I feel bad all the time,
and I don't know what to do.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.715
Do you believe in God?

35:02.058 --> 35:03.515
I'm tired, okay?

35:05.478 --> 35:07.470
Yeah, well, you know,
I'd like to know.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.514
- Not now.
- When?

35:11.026 --> 35:12.358
Please.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.442
You're sick, and you don't know
what you believe?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.992
I know I feel like shit.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.576
I know that the idea
of taking a breath without pain

35:26.583 --> 35:27.915
sounds like heaven...

35:27.917 --> 35:30.955
and when you're dead,
you don't breathe...

35:31.546 --> 35:32.582
so...

35:35.467 --> 35:36.924
I'm just tired.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.428
Whoa.

35:45.852 --> 35:46.968
Phenomenal.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.185
I...

35:48.188 --> 35:49.554
Can explain?

35:51.483 --> 35:52.769
I like fuzzy things.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.229
Like peaches, and kiwis,
and Hostess Snowballs.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.447
I like you like this.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.321
I think it makes you look...

36:02.786 --> 36:05.119
- Ivy, I have...
- ...more like a person.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.948
You know,
when I first met you...

36:08.958 --> 36:11.575
...I thought I was gonna
be intimidated by you.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.498
Never met anybody on TV before.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.170
But now...

36:20.303 --> 36:21.635
you're more real.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.263
See?

36:35.985 --> 36:38.648
I bet whoever bandaged it
forgot to do that.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.048
Oh, my God, someone's early.
Tell Dad.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.676
James.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.634
Well, who died?

37:07.434 --> 37:09.096
- What are you doing?
- Put some pants on.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.638
I got a van
full of kids outside.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.477
Most of them don't need the keys
to get it started.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.596
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.939
I can't. I'm helping my dad
with his party.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.353
- What?
- Oh, my God.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.194
I must have gotten
the days mixed up.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.733
Coop, I said you could go.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.445
Look, 30 seconds,
and the van's history.

37:25.452 --> 37:26.693
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

37:26.703 --> 37:27.784
What's going on here?

37:27.787 --> 37:29.653
- Hi, Mr. Cooper. How are you?
- Hi, James.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.289
- What's this?
- What's it gonna be, Sylvie?

37:32.292 --> 37:35.080
You knew.
How could you do this?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.167
I don't know.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.836
I don't know.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.420
I was counting on her help here,
James.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.964
I promised my dad.

37:47.849 --> 37:48.930
Great.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.222
You know, she's the reason those
kids are even in school now.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.220
If she doesn't show up,
why should they?

37:54.939 --> 37:55.939
Well?

37:57.317 --> 37:58.979
Well, maybe I could help.

38:00.028 --> 38:03.442
I mean, I think I can handle
taking people's coats

38:03.448 --> 38:05.280
and showing them
where the bathroom is.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.150
Please. I feel so stupid.

38:08.703 --> 38:09.864
Let me make it up.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.326
I'll wear something nice.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.619
You'll love me.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.452
Sounds good.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.757
Dad, what should I do?

38:29.265 --> 38:30.346
Go ahead, honey.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.761
We'll figure it out.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.271
Yeah. That's right. Bob.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.894
But I... I spell it backwards.
B-O-B.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.531
God,
I hope they serve dinner soon.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.618
Who cares?
I feel guilty eating his food.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.781
Hey, kid. Over here.

38:51.788 --> 38:53.324
Who's gonna tell him?

38:54.082 --> 38:55.744
I thought his kid had dark hair.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.036
Must be a caterer.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.535
I wonder if Georgie
will make an appearance.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.538
Think she will?
I heard she's getting worse.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.790
Oh, you can cater my party
any time.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.000
Max, behave yourself.

39:05.385 --> 39:06.921
My fingers never left my hand.

39:06.928 --> 39:09.090
His wife, remember?
Maybe she's still alive.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.432
Hello, Mr. Cooper.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.221
Care for anything?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.856
That... dress fits you perfectly.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.363
You look...

39:28.366 --> 39:29.607
Beautiful?

39:31.244 --> 39:32.860
Something like that, yeah.

39:38.626 --> 39:39.787
Oh.

39:40.670 --> 39:41.831
I almost forgot.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.749
You're not allowed.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.714
I'm not an alcoholic.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.300
I used to have
a drinking problem,

39:48.303 --> 39:50.169
but since I don't drink
anymore...

39:51.264 --> 39:52.380
this is okay.

42:36.012 --> 42:38.129
Honey,
I'm glad you're awake. I...

42:39.015 --> 42:40.051
You look nice.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.513
How stupid of me.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.639
What a dumb,
sick jerk I've been.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.185
Honey, quiet. Now, there's...

42:50.193 --> 42:52.810
Which little party
are you afraid of me ruining?

42:55.907 --> 42:57.694
Everybody's gone home.
It's okay.

43:19.972 --> 43:24.091
I was so happy that Sylvie
had found a... little friend.

43:29.857 --> 43:30.938
Honey.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.058
Get away from me.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.115
I thought you both
could use this.

43:42.328 --> 43:43.739
Get out.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.743
I feel so stupid.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.159
I shouldn't have
worn your clothes.

43:50.169 --> 43:54.504
Everybody said I look like you,
and he misses you so much.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.593
I think he came
into the kitchen to cry.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.599
And I saw him,
and I put my arms around him.

44:10.356 --> 44:11.597
It seemed right.

44:13.943 --> 44:14.943
I'm sorry.

44:23.578 --> 44:24.785
It's okay.

44:32.587 --> 44:33.873
He doesn't drink.

44:34.463 --> 44:35.463
Oh, right.

44:51.731 --> 44:52.767
I'm sorry.

48:14.475 --> 48:15.556
<i>Fred?</i>

48:29.740 --> 48:30.901
Wild party.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.111
Fred?

48:37.039 --> 48:38.325
Fred?

49:02.231 --> 49:05.019
<i>I know it's stupid
to be jealous about a dog.</i>

49:05.025 --> 49:07.438
<i>It's probably because
I have low self-esteem.</i>

49:08.070 --> 49:10.858
<i>The fact that Fred hated
every human except me...</i>

49:10.865 --> 49:12.322
<i>really meant something.</i>

49:17.288 --> 49:20.201
My father never gave me
anything real.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.454
<i>I guess you give up
certain things</i>

49:27.465 --> 49:28.876
<i>when you take on a friendship.</i>

49:34.096 --> 49:35.587
Come on, Fred.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.888
I know you want some
of my special treats.

49:44.857 --> 49:46.974
No one else gives you any,
do they?

49:52.114 --> 49:54.197
You love me, don't you?

51:42.349 --> 51:43.681
So, did it work?

51:45.477 --> 51:46.558
What?

51:47.396 --> 51:48.477
The party.

51:50.190 --> 51:52.477
Well, let me tell you
about parties.

51:54.486 --> 51:56.398
People eat your food,
drink your booze,

51:56.405 --> 51:58.522
and do what they're
gonna do anyway.

52:00.326 --> 52:01.612
Have you seen Fred?

52:05.539 --> 52:06.780
Hmm?

52:09.376 --> 52:10.492
Um...

52:11.420 --> 52:12.752
I better get to school.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.918
Oh, no.

52:20.512 --> 52:21.753
Jesus.

52:32.733 --> 52:34.645
What the hell are you doing
in my mom's car?

52:35.402 --> 52:36.768
I found the key.

52:38.614 --> 52:41.072
It's not yours. Get out.
Get out.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.362
God, I wasn't doing anything.

52:43.369 --> 52:45.531
And leave my goddamn dog alone.

52:46.205 --> 52:47.696
You're kidding.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.790
Gee, all my mom's stuff
seems to fit you fine.

52:50.793 --> 52:52.125
Look, I didn't steal anything.

52:52.127 --> 52:54.244
She said I could
borrow some stuff.

52:54.254 --> 52:56.917
Yeah, well, you're not my
friend, and my dog's a traitor.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.541
That's not true.

52:59.551 --> 53:00.541
Oh, really?

53:00.552 --> 53:03.090
Well, suddenly he seems to think
that he's yours.

53:03.097 --> 53:04.429
Bullshit.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.423
All right, let's find out.
Stand over there.

53:06.433 --> 53:08.049
You know what this is?

53:08.936 --> 53:11.053
Fuck you with a limp dick!

53:11.939 --> 53:13.055
Do it.

53:13.065 --> 53:14.772
Go! Do it!

53:16.110 --> 53:18.727
- God, this is so stupid.
- Call him.

53:23.367 --> 53:24.574
Do it!

53:25.828 --> 53:26.828
Here, boy.

53:29.748 --> 53:30.864
Fred.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.956
Go ahead. Keep calling him.

53:37.423 --> 53:40.461
Fred. Oh, Fred.

53:41.969 --> 53:43.926
God damn it, Fred.
I called you.

53:46.390 --> 53:47.972
Fred, come here.

53:49.852 --> 53:51.639
No, Fred. Come here.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.897
No, Fred. Come here.

53:55.899 --> 53:58.312
Fred, I called you.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.276
Come here, Fred.

54:04.408 --> 54:06.445
Fred,
get your fuzzy ass over here.

54:12.374 --> 54:13.910
That's a good boy.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.418
Fuck you, Fred.

54:22.926 --> 54:26.044
Here. Here's something
your mother didn't loan me.

56:05.028 --> 56:06.269
Hi, Ivy.

56:08.407 --> 56:10.899
I... got off work early.

56:10.909 --> 56:12.195
I figured, what the hell...

56:13.036 --> 56:14.743
give the girls a ride.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.492
Coop's not here.

56:18.792 --> 56:20.124
Oh.

56:20.127 --> 56:21.368
Well, uh...

56:22.379 --> 56:23.711
you want a ride?

56:24.423 --> 56:27.541
Look, Darryl, why don't you
just give my books a ride home?

56:27.551 --> 56:29.008
I feel like walking.

56:37.686 --> 56:38.802
Get in.

56:45.903 --> 56:46.939
Get in.

56:47.487 --> 56:48.853
You're not my father.

56:50.741 --> 56:51.741
That's right. I'm not.

57:03.962 --> 57:05.373
Oh, no.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.087
I just can't...

57:11.011 --> 57:12.468
You already did.

57:13.889 --> 57:15.221
Remember last night?

57:19.853 --> 57:20.934
I can stop.

57:23.649 --> 57:25.356
Okay. How about right here?

57:26.568 --> 57:27.568
Stop.

57:31.281 --> 57:32.281
Get out.

57:37.412 --> 57:38.528
You heard me.

57:41.375 --> 57:42.456
I hurt you?

57:43.835 --> 57:45.667
Heard me.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.375
I thought you said "hurt me."

57:52.386 --> 57:53.386
No, I didn't.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.396
Did I hurt you?

58:07.651 --> 58:08.858
Ivy...

58:10.445 --> 58:11.777
I can handle this.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.589
Wow.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.583
You have a key.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:05.962
I didn't know
if I should use it.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.016
Look, I'm really sorry
about your dog.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.732
I've never had one,

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.856
and it was sort of fun
pretending he was mine.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:30.953
He likes you best.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.329
I'm sorry.
It won't ever happen again.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.012
By the way, what was that record
you were playing?

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.434
Okay, Ivy, don't overdo it.

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.725
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.446
You think about it sometimes,
don't you?

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:50.859
Sometimes.

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:25.986
Mom?

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.470
<i>I never thought my mom
would really do it.</i>

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:37.673
<i>She threatened,
but I didn't believe her.</i>

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:40.892
<i>She must have really hurt.</i>

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:50.227
<i>When she first got sick,
I thought she was faking.</i>

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.697
<i>I was embarrassed by her.</i>

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:56.320
<i>It made me angry.</i>

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.453
<i>This little oxygen bottle
she carried with her...</i>

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:02.581
<i>We'd be at the supermarket,
and she'd pull it out.</i>

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.494
<i>Hiss, suck. Hiss, suck.</i>

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.959
<i>I wanted to kill her.</i>

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.715
<i>Maybe if I hadn't
been so selfish...</i>

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.512
<i>maybe if I could have
told her I loved her...</i>

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.428
<i>maybe things
would be different now.</i>

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.523
Leave it open.

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:12.609
The door.

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:13.693
Leave it open.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.661
You're in my mother's bed.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.993
You looked like you
needed to be alone.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.207
Come here.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:36.671
Come here. It's okay.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:54.985
Talk to me.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.774
This is weird.

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:02.697
I wanted to talk to her,
you know?

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:06.030
Tell her stuff before she died.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.207
Tell me.

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:10.952
What?

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.037
Pretend I'm her.

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:16.457
Come on. I'm your mom.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.629
I don't know what to say.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.719
Well, what couldn't you say
to me?

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:22.845
Come on. I'm Georgie.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.175
But...

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.551
I was jealous of you.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:31.479
When you walked into a room...

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.600
people shut up and stared.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.862
I was glad when you got sick.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.076
I thought I would
finally have my turn...

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.249
but I was wrong.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.417
Everything was for you.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.837
There was nothing left for me.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.169
I don't buy it, Sylvie.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:05.138
You were never afraid
to get angry at me.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.933
That was easy and obvious.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.805
What couldn't you say?

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.770
What were you afraid to say?

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.862
I love you.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:33.078
<i>The plan that's
federally supported...</i>

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:34.292
<i>would ease the debt burden...</i>

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:35.975
<i>and control the soaring
cost of medicine...</i>

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.331
<i>making health care
more readily available</i>

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.877
<i>to those who need it most:</i>

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.837
<i>small businesses...</i>

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.426
<i>independent contractors...</i>

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.886
<i>and the unemployed.</i>

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:46.345
<i>It's a shame
that in a country...</i>

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.055
What the hell is this?

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.510
It's a tough way
for you to find out...

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.227
What do they think
they're doing?

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.646
I don't know.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.604
I mean, I...
I tried to call you.

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.609
I'm sorry, Darryl.

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:10.783
<i>This is Brad Daly,
general manager of KTVM...</i>

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.122
<i>in touch with you.</i>

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.717
Hey, Coop.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.215
Let's go for a drive...

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.475
all three of us.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.308
All three of us?

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.141
We shouldn't be doing this.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.022
It's completion.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:26.318
A final memorial,
the kind she would have liked.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.241
- I just feel like, I mean...
- Look.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:32.406
It's your chance
to say good-bye...

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.497
and mine, too.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.163
Well, they say it might rain.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.995
One can always hope.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.458
Are you sure you can drive?

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:49.261
Yeah.
This is an automatic, right?

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:53.807
I'm just kidding.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:57.303
I used to have to drive my mom
home when she was too blasted.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:11.029
Slow down!

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.742
I thought you could drive.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:17.081
Well, it was on an interstate.
All straight, no turns.

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.289
Aren't you supposed
to shift that thing

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:23.787
every once in a while?

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.624
Okay, forget shifting.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:39.604
It's so weird.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:41.314
What?

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.940
Some... like...

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:47.732
A whole person ending up
in something so small.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.365
Watch it!

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.404
Whoa!

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:55.323
Sorry.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.912
I'm not gonna say anything.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.053
What is that?

01:13:18.185 --> 01:13:19.266
What?

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.386
That song.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.766
What are you talking about?

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.059
You were just humming.

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:26.273
So?

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.393
So where'd you hear it?

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.186
I don't know.

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:31.276
I do. I wrote it.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.233
Dad recorded it for Mom
for her birthday.

01:13:36.454 --> 01:13:38.116
You heard it in her room.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:39.748
So?

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.247
So...

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.462
she was playing it that morning.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.923
Oh, my God.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.087
You were there.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.342
What did she say to you?

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.385
Ivy!

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.343
Come on!
She was about to kill herself.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:03.061
She must have said something.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.932
Why won't you tell me
what my mother said?

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:10.815
Please stop!

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:11.902
Say it!
I want to hear you say it!

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:14.193
Are you accusing me
of something?

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.320
Why, did you do something?

01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:19.327
Everybody always
ends up blaming me!

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:20.537
I thought you were different!

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.997
I thought that
we were real friends!

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:24.662
Look out!

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.767
<i>Dr. Shay, report
to the on-call cardiologist...</i>

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:10.855
Mr. Cooper?

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.227
I know you probably feel
like strangling her,

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.149
but you're gonna
have to hold off.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.692
She's had a head injury.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:20.531
One of the nurses said
she's been hallucinating,

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:22.275
so I definitely want
to keep her here

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:24.528
for at least a couple of days.

01:16:25.456 --> 01:16:28.790
Have fun. Nurse is gonna chase
you out in about ten minutes.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:29.954
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.804
Everything is Ivy.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.016
- She did it.
- Shh.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:52.605
Dad.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.317
What the hell is this?

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:57.770
Dad.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.021
That's real.

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:01.322
Dad, she...

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:02.486
Where is she?

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.243
This is unbelievable.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:06.726
I don't want her
at the house anymore.

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:08.947
What the hell's the matter
with you, Sylvie?

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:12.458
She killed my mother.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.870
Your mother committed suicide.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.161
You almost killed yourself.
You almost killed your friend.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.840
Me?

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:20.643
Who drove the car?
Who took your mother's urn?

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.298
Ivy!

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.637
Oh, stop it.
Just stop the lying, will you?

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.632
- I'm not lying.
- I know you were driving.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:32.186
She's gotten to you, too,
hasn't she?

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.057
That's enough.

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:39.770
I'll see you in the morning.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:01.398
Oh. Hey, Charla, room 828, OK?

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.772
We ought to put motors
on these things.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:09.798
Nice outfit.

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.301
Did you do the blood yourself?

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.774
- Thanks.
- Take care.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.186
And enjoy the duds.

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:27.983
I stole them myself.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:14.427
Oh, my God. It's Sylvie.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:21.559
Sylvie!

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.309
Shit!

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.660
I can find her.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.529
Ow! You're hurting me!

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:52.582
You were driving.

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:53.674
She made me.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.669
- She what?
- Made me!

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:00.848
I was protecting you.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:03.427
The car insurance.

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:05.679
Isn't it better
if Coop's driving?

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.310
I got to find her.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.650
- You can't even walk!
- Aw, Jesus.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.188
Stay inside, and I'll find her.

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:13.937
You just stay put.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.987
Just stay.

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:08.722
Mom?

01:25:45.432 --> 01:25:47.139
I've got to tell you something.

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:53.396
I love you.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.567
I love you.

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:17.837
You killed her.

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:21.003
She wanted to die.

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:25.089
We can all be together now.

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:29.178
We can all be a family.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:33.018
Fuck you!

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:40.568
I can take you with me.

01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:22.355
<i>I still think about her.</i>
