iconic dead mother,

14:54.602 --> 14:55.717
REGINA: Just tell me
about the graveyard.

14:55.812 --> 14:59.805
If I find a headstone,
does that mean that person's here in

15:00.400 --> 15:01.480
Underbrooke?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.432
"Underbrooke"? (SCOFFS)

15:03.694 --> 15:04.729
Oh, you are clever.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.278
No. ltjust means
they're passing through, that's all.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.652
-Who are you looking for?
-Oh, never mind who.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.823

l have a map here,

15:18.418 --> 15:19.624

15:20.002 --> 15:22.960
Oh. Thanks to your
recently departed mother.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.382
It's got a list of the cemetery plots.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.335
And you have to know
how to interpret the headstones.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.092
You see, there's three...
What do you call them? Settings.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.850
If the headstone is upright,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.799
it means the person is still here in town.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.054
If it's tipped over,

15:38.146 --> 15:41.889
it means their soul has gone on
to a better place, okay?

15:42.150 --> 15:43.390
Happy person, tippy stone.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.690
And the third setting?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.978
If it's cracked, well, that's bad.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.187
Bad.

They got pulled under to

15:55.163 --> 15:56.494

This boat's the best thing
we could have hoped to find.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.928
After we pick up the pirate,
it'll take us all the way home.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.606
This is it. He's down there. I feel it.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.063
I'm not leaving the boat.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.906
It's too valuable.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.570
You're capable of getting
the pirate on your own, I'm sure.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.618
And don't even
think about using magic.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.162

this close to his home base.

If he's not moving, I'm not either.

I'll give a shout.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.434
It's a dagger, not a dragon.
Don't be scared of it.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.858
I'm scared because our son is dying.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.987
He should be with us,
not some village nursemaid.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.986
I didn't spend our last gold coin
on a knife

17:16.077 --> 17:18.568

beyond our small port.

Aye.

on jeweled chairs.

He gave me the cure
because we made a deal.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.334
He wanted something else
instead of gold.

What did you give him?

my second-born child.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.431
You...

30:53.477 --> 30:54.967
You sold our child?

30:56.521 --> 30:57.636
No.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.063
No, no, no. That's it. I mean, I didn't.

31:00.150 --> 31:03.358
We don't have a second-born child.
We just have to make sure we never do.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.443
Because you sold them.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.447
-You sold our future.
-No.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.109
Thank you very much

31:47.739 --> 31:52.153

of my narrow little life for me.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.493
I'm going to the tavern, Rumple.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.142
What the hell?

32:16.226 --> 32:19.309
Hades was just here.
What's going on, Rumple?

32:25.152 --> 32:26.892
Congratulations, dearie.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.646

33:07.736 --> 33:09.397
He blew my magic right back at me.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.738
Milah. I couldn't stop it.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.483
She's gone.

Milah was here?

33:22.459 --> 33:24.040
Milah.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.034
She helped us get to you.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.380

Indeed, he does.

I'll be all right.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.722
How did you do it?

35:02.809 --> 35:05.551
Gold got us in, he got us help,
he poofed us back here.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.352
He even had a boat
to get us all back home.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.101
But it's gone.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.226
What happened?

35:11.318 --> 35:13.434
Hades attacked.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.938
We lost the boat,

35:16.406 --> 35:18.271
and we lost a friend.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.576
I hear you took away my sacrifice.

35:25.624 --> 35:30.744
Everything I did to save my friends
all went to give you back your power.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.046
I should kill you.

So let's do this heart-split.

36:52.669 --> 36:57.789
Hades told me to pick three names
and chisel them onto the headstones.

He said whoever I picked
would remain in the UndenNorld.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.375

he did the picking himself.

You weren't like this before.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.524
That's right.

Why, you ask?

Because you tried to
hide something from me.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.467

39:51.180 --> 39:53.171
So pretty.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.923
I mean, I've been
watching her for hours,

39:54.976 --> 39:57.262
and she is simply darling.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.975
You put this crystal ball
together so well.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.310
Using the eyeball? Inspired.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.810
And then, butterfingers, you dropped it.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.774
Insane. After all that work.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.324
And I couldn't figure out

40:10.450 --> 40:15.160
why an image of your wife
would affect you so strongly.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.492
So I did a little digging
and a little thinking.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.997
And I realized

40:20.126 --> 40:24.210
you weren't trying to conjure
an image of her, were you?

40:26.341 --> 40:28.673
You were trying to figure out

40:28.718 --> 40:30.379
where your son went.

40:31.971 --> 40:34.007
You asked the crystal ball

40:34.057 --> 40:37.345
to show you your child.

40:37.477 --> 40:38.557
Didn't you?

-No, no, no.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.474
...this is an image of your child.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.142
Your next child.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.563

(GRUNTS)

41:00.541 --> 41:02.042
(CHUCKLES) Remember him?

41:02.210 --> 41:04.542
You two had a contract.

41:04.587 --> 41:08.751
You tried to void it by killing him
during a certain potentially

41:08.883 --> 41:10.339
baby-making liaison

41:10.385 --> 41:13.718
with your prote'ge'
the Evil Queen's mother,

41:13.763 --> 41:14.878
Cora.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.762
You rascal. (CHUCKLES)

41:16.891 --> 41:18.552
Which seemed smart at the time.

41:18.685 --> 41:23.224
But it turns out death
doesn't actually nullify a contract.

41:23.356 --> 41:26.894
Not down here, because here he is.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.228
And...

41:30.738 --> 41:31.853
Here is the contract.

41:34.534 --> 41:37.742
Which he just signed over to me.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.415
So, just to be super, extra clear,

41:44.460 --> 41:46.075
at any time,

41:46.212 --> 41:49.079
I can cash in the debt

41:50.758 --> 41:54.216
and take your baby.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.550
All magic comes with a price.

41:59.809 --> 42:02.425
And now, Dark One, the price is

42:03.396 --> 42:07.105
you work for me.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.770
And there's something I need you to do

42:15.283 --> 42:17.774
that only you can do.
