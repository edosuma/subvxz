00:00.414 --> 00:02.025
<i>Previously
on "The Bold Type"...</i>

00:02.028 --> 00:04.469
- Richard? You're here.
- I came here to see you.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.204
It's always been you.
You ready?

00:06.206 --> 00:08.659
Let's do this.
Where's Adena?

00:08.661 --> 00:09.730
She's not coming.

00:09.732 --> 00:11.298
I didn't realize
the fight was that bad.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.882
She said that she needs
more space to be creative.

00:13.884 --> 00:16.024
Being with me limits her.

00:16.026 --> 00:17.570
I figure if "Safford"
wants to punish me

00:17.572 --> 00:19.312
for publishing an article
about women's health

00:19.314 --> 00:22.144
in their signature woman's
magazine, I say have at it.

00:22.146 --> 00:24.428
Jacqueline must have really
pissed the board off

00:24.430 --> 00:26.311
because I'm looking
at a short list to replace her.

00:26.313 --> 00:27.754
I still can't believe
you have two

00:27.756 --> 00:29.156
guys fighting over you!

00:29.158 --> 00:30.358
If you got
really good news,

00:30.360 --> 00:31.640
who would you call first?

00:31.642 --> 00:32.962
Ryan or Ben?

00:32.964 --> 00:33.883
Do you think you know?

00:33.885 --> 00:35.889
Yeah. I do.

00:38.493 --> 00:39.973
Right there.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.748
That was amazing.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.836
Was? Are we done?

00:53.838 --> 00:56.801
- No.
- Good.

01:03.494 --> 01:04.613
Oh, my God.

01:04.614 --> 01:06.376
I don't have clothes for work.

01:06.378 --> 01:07.819
Just wear
what you wore yesterday.

01:07.821 --> 01:11.384
I can't!
I have to go!

01:11.386 --> 01:12.707
No, no, no...
or...

01:14.391 --> 01:16.994
Maybe you just move in.

01:16.996 --> 01:19.037
Are you... serious?

01:19.039 --> 01:20.760
Yeah!
It's been a month.

01:20.762 --> 01:22.723
We're doing good, right?

01:22.725 --> 01:24.005
Yeah.

01:24.007 --> 01:25.567
So?

01:25.569 --> 01:26.970
What do you say?

01:26.972 --> 01:31.738
Um... it's a...
that's a big step.

01:31.740 --> 01:33.741
Kind of the idea.

01:33.743 --> 01:35.383
What do you say?

01:37.749 --> 01:41.754
Um... can I think about it?

01:41.756 --> 01:43.757
Of course.

01:43.759 --> 01:45.600
Okay.

01:45.602 --> 01:47.764
No, no, no, no!

01:47.766 --> 01:51.930
You know what?
I have two more minutes.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.473 --> 02:05.633
Ah!

02:32.158 --> 02:33.638
I still feel responsible.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.681
If I hadn't pushed Jacqueline

02:35.683 --> 02:37.965
to publish my article
calling out "Safford,"

02:37.967 --> 02:39.528
there would be no
new head of digital

02:39.530 --> 02:41.531
and no office pool
betting who it is.

02:41.533 --> 02:43.694
It's definitely that woman
from "Yes, Girl."

02:43.696 --> 02:45.820
I had Alex put 20 bucks on it
for me.

02:48.745 --> 02:51.547
Why do you insist
on walking around naked?

02:51.549 --> 02:56.515
Because I know
that secretly you love it.

02:56.517 --> 02:58.879
Hmm? Tell me I'm wrong.

02:58.881 --> 03:00.482
- Go grab me some coffee.
- Okay.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.044
Oh, also,
will you grab my laptop?

03:02.046 --> 03:03.166
Sure.

03:03.168 --> 03:04.608
You should try it, you know?

03:04.610 --> 03:06.694
It's really...
it's quite liberating.

03:08.056 --> 03:09.617
Hello!

03:09.619 --> 03:11.580
Wow.

03:11.582 --> 03:13.703
Uh...

03:17.632 --> 03:18.872
Okay, well...

03:18.874 --> 03:20.514
Sorry, I'm not laughing
at you.

03:20.516 --> 03:22.918
I know.
I'm just gonna...

03:26.526 --> 03:28.607
This is what you get.
Mm-hmm.

03:29.771 --> 03:31.612
Nice, right?

03:33.097 --> 03:34.818
<i>You saw
Pinstripe's peen-stripe?</i>

03:34.820 --> 03:37.262
I did.
I saw the not-so-weeny peeny.

03:37.264 --> 03:39.105
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

03:39.107 --> 03:40.907
Until he covered it up
with a photo

03:40.909 --> 03:43.632
of Ben's face
from "Scarlet" magazine.

03:43.634 --> 03:45.475
Wait, what are you
talking about?

03:45.477 --> 03:47.638
Somebody was doing
a little reading up on Ben.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.121
Oh. Seller's remorse?

03:49.123 --> 03:50.964
I wasn't reading it.

03:50.966 --> 03:53.608
Look, Ben is great, but...

03:53.610 --> 03:55.050
after he learned
about my BRCA status,

03:55.052 --> 03:58.135
it got complicated,
and we never recovered.

03:58.137 --> 04:01.221
- It just wasn't right
- Yeah.

04:01.223 --> 04:04.225
Everything okay?

04:04.227 --> 04:06.589
Yeah.
No, I'm just, uh...

04:06.591 --> 04:07.831
I've been so busy with work,

04:07.833 --> 04:09.835
I forgot to send
Adena's stuff back.

04:13.282 --> 04:15.123
Uh, what's with the tote bag?

04:15.125 --> 04:16.886
Is that all you're bringing
to Richard's?

04:16.887 --> 04:18.849
Yeah, why didn't you
pack more clothes?

04:18.851 --> 04:21.053
Eh... you know.

04:23.098 --> 04:24.859
What?

04:26.183 --> 04:30.188
Richard asked me
to move in with him.

04:30.190 --> 04:31.189
Wow.

04:31.191 --> 04:34.154
That's so great.

04:34.156 --> 04:36.197
So great. So great.

04:36.199 --> 04:37.880
Yeah, well, I mean,
I told him

04:37.882 --> 04:40.044
I had to think about it,
you know?

04:40.046 --> 04:41.566
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

04:44.894 --> 04:46.895
Obviously, if I did
move in with him,

04:46.897 --> 04:49.018
I would pay rent
until you found somebody else.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.901
I appreciate that.

04:50.903 --> 04:52.905
I mean, I'm not saying
that I will move out, but...

04:52.907 --> 04:56.230
You should.
If you want to.

04:58.676 --> 05:00.076
Oh, my God!

05:01.240 --> 05:03.243
- Oh, God.
- You okay?

05:04.686 --> 05:07.769
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

05:07.771 --> 05:09.131
- What were you doing?
- Jane!

05:09.133 --> 05:10.814
This is not a bike lane!

05:10.816 --> 05:12.256
I was riding
with the flow of traffic,

05:12.258 --> 05:13.979
so that's totally legal,
but thank you.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.142
At least I'll have a good story
for my first day.

05:16.144 --> 05:17.424
Your first day?
I would have thought

05:17.426 --> 05:19.388
you've made tons
of weed deliveries by now.

05:19.390 --> 05:22.392
No, that was
my high school job.

05:22.394 --> 05:24.155
I'm sorry, are you
Patrick Duchand?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.998
I don't care who this is.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.801
You should be riding
in the bike lane.

05:27.803 --> 05:30.325
Jane.
It's his first day.

05:30.327 --> 05:33.370
- His first day with...
- "Scarlet" magazine.

05:33.372 --> 05:34.452
I'm the head of the dot-com.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.313
They chose a man
to run digital

05:47.315 --> 05:48.675
at a woman's magazine?

05:48.677 --> 05:50.238
Is this 'cause
you're moving out?

05:50.240 --> 05:51.920
I haven't even decided yet.

05:51.922 --> 05:53.323
Really thought you gals
would be talking

05:53.325 --> 05:54.685
about Patrick Duchand.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.247
We are.
And we are not happy.

05:56.249 --> 05:58.331
I mean, things change
all the time,

05:58.333 --> 06:01.176
so you can either fight it
or embrace it.

06:01.178 --> 06:03.099
I'm choosing to embrace it.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.342
That guy's, like, 15.

06:05.344 --> 06:06.985
And he wasn't in
the office pool.

06:06.987 --> 06:08.267
Look, I'll get you
your money back.

06:08.269 --> 06:10.190
Jacqueline must be livid.

06:10.192 --> 06:12.153
Hey, staff meeting
in the bullpen.

06:12.155 --> 06:13.435
The bullpen?

06:13.437 --> 06:15.078
Yeah, it was
Patrick's suggestion.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.282
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

06:17.284 --> 06:19.125
Okay, everyone!

06:19.127 --> 06:22.009
So, we have
a very exciting opportunity

06:22.011 --> 06:24.293
to take our dot-com
to the next level,

06:24.295 --> 06:27.939
and that opportunity
is Patrick Duchand.

06:27.941 --> 06:31.024
He is going to be in charge
of all digital content

06:31.026 --> 06:33.268
and really help
make it stand out

06:33.270 --> 06:36.152
the same way that our print
magazine already does.

06:36.154 --> 06:37.755
Now, as all of you know,
tomorrow

06:37.757 --> 06:40.279
is our annual Scarlet Summit,

06:40.281 --> 06:41.441
where we open up the magazine

06:41.443 --> 06:43.084
to hundreds
of "Scarlet" readers

06:43.086 --> 06:44.165
and influencers.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.409
We have incredible speakers.

06:46.411 --> 06:49.534
Our workshops and panels
are completely sold out.

06:49.536 --> 06:52.379
And thanks to Patrick,
his dear friend

06:52.381 --> 06:56.185
Betty Who is hosting
a private concert.

06:56.187 --> 06:58.268
So, thank you, Patrick.

06:58.270 --> 07:00.352
- Yeah.
- So it should be fun.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.236
Patrick, I'm sure you have
a few words you'd like to say.

07:03.238 --> 07:06.321
- Thank you, Jacqueline.
- Absolutely.

07:06.323 --> 07:11.129
Wow. I'm so psyched
to be here.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.373
"Scarlet" was a big part
of my sexual awakening.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.416
I used to wait
until my big sister

07:15.418 --> 07:19.222
would fall asleep
so I could walk into her room

07:19.224 --> 07:20.344
and steal it
from her nightstand

07:20.346 --> 07:22.107
and fawn over
the fashion pages.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.232
I should probably thank you
for that, Oliver.

07:25.234 --> 07:29.399
My philosophy for the dot-com:
be open.

07:29.401 --> 07:32.203
Right? Open your eyes,
open your minds,

07:32.205 --> 07:33.846
and open your hearts.

07:33.848 --> 07:35.329
You see, the more open
we are spiritually,

07:35.331 --> 07:38.333
the more open we become
to new story ideas.

07:38.335 --> 07:41.258
That kind of thinking,
it's what made me a success,

07:41.260 --> 07:43.061
and it's that kind of thinking
that's gonna make

07:43.063 --> 07:46.026
everyone in this room
a success.

07:46.028 --> 07:47.508
I don't believe in barriers,

07:47.510 --> 07:49.512
and I don't see hierarchy.

07:49.514 --> 07:51.435
- Can't argue with that.
- Oh, that reminds me.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.319
I'd love to meet with each
of you individually, okay?

07:54.321 --> 07:55.401
I'll find you!

07:55.403 --> 07:57.284
I have R.J. Safford
on the line.

07:57.286 --> 07:58.526
Okay, I'll take that
in my office.

07:58.528 --> 07:59.528
Actually, it's for Patrick.

07:59.530 --> 08:01.050
Oh, for Patrick? Yeah.

08:01.052 --> 08:04.376
Right, of course.
That makes sense.

08:04.378 --> 08:07.260
Okay. That's all for now.

08:07.262 --> 08:08.302
Namaste.

08:08.304 --> 08:10.868
Namaste.

08:17.319 --> 08:19.560
- Jacqueline?
- Oh, hi, Jane.

08:19.562 --> 08:21.566
Come on in.

08:22.647 --> 08:24.328
What's up?

08:24.330 --> 08:26.333
Um...

08:27.415 --> 08:30.498
This whole thing with Patrick
never would have happened

08:30.500 --> 08:33.022
if I hadn't asked you
to publish my article.

08:33.024 --> 08:35.106
Jane,
this is not your fault.

08:35.107 --> 08:36.628
Patrick coming in
is a culmination

08:36.630 --> 08:38.351
of so many things.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.234
So many things
that culminated with me

08:40.236 --> 08:43.078
calling out "Safford" for their
unfair health care policy.

08:43.081 --> 08:45.723
And I am really glad
that you wrote that article.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.286
- Really?
- Yes.

08:47.288 --> 08:50.411
And I'm even more glad
that I published it.

08:50.413 --> 08:52.534
What we did together
is amazing.

08:52.536 --> 08:55.739
We spoke up.
We actually made change happen.

08:55.741 --> 08:58.426
And now you can afford
to freeze your eggs.

09:01.110 --> 09:03.113
You're right.

09:03.514 --> 09:05.435
We have to give him a chance.

09:05.437 --> 09:07.478
Who knows,
he could have some good ideas.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.123
Right. Thanks.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.485
Can you close my door
on your way out?

09:11.487 --> 09:12.727
Mm-hmm.

09:15.413 --> 09:16.653
Alex, right?

09:16.655 --> 09:18.256
- Yeah.
- Great to meet you, finally.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.498
- I've heard good things.
- Okay.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.383
So, dude, it seems like
you're, like,

09:22.385 --> 09:24.506
kind of underutilized
around here.

09:24.508 --> 09:26.429
A straight guy working
at a woman's magazine?

09:26.431 --> 09:28.432
I mean, that's...
that's a solid home run.

09:28.434 --> 09:29.755
I bet you give a lot
of free advice.

09:29.757 --> 09:32.359
Yeah, I could write
my own column.

09:32.361 --> 09:35.123
That's genius.
"Ask Alex" for the dot-com.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.365
You're brilliant.
Dude, brilliant.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.447
Start sending me pitches?

09:37.449 --> 09:39.210
Uh, yeah.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.779
Jacqueline gave me a run-down
of the digital team,

09:44.781 --> 09:46.822
and you have had
an incredible year.

09:46.824 --> 09:49.547
I mean, look at you,
changing policy

09:49.549 --> 09:51.790
to allow for diverse voices
like Angie, and then...

09:51.792 --> 09:53.513
Yeah.

09:53.515 --> 09:56.157
Coming out with your fabulous
Muslim artist girlfriend.

09:56.159 --> 09:57.720
It's incredible.
I'm impressed.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.403
- Adena.
- Mm-hmm.

09:59.405 --> 10:01.767
Right, yeah.

10:01.769 --> 10:05.413
Well, actually,
she's not, um...

10:05.415 --> 10:08.097
in town at the moment.

10:08.099 --> 10:09.780
She's out of town.

10:09.782 --> 10:12.744
She's in Morocco
at an artist retreat.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.427
Cool. Amazing.

10:14.429 --> 10:16.511
So is your "Free the Nipple"
campaign, by the way.

10:16.513 --> 10:17.632
Thank you.

10:17.634 --> 10:19.275
But Kat, when I look up
your personal

10:19.277 --> 10:20.918
social media,
it's really lacking.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.841
It's crickets
since Paris Fashion week.

10:22.843 --> 10:25.445
Well, you know,
I've just been, uh,

10:25.447 --> 10:26.807
taking a bit of
a social media hiatus.

10:26.809 --> 10:29.692
No, a digital detox
for the head of social media,

10:29.694 --> 10:31.455
that can't happen.

10:31.457 --> 10:33.618
You're an extension
of "Scarlet", right?

10:33.620 --> 10:36.463
Your job, your girlfriend,
your access to clothes

10:36.465 --> 10:39.228
and parties
and all things fabulous.

10:39.230 --> 10:40.470
Okay, well,
I'll start posting

10:40.472 --> 10:41.591
on all my personal accounts.

10:41.593 --> 10:43.555
Yeah, I'm gonna tag you,

10:43.557 --> 10:46.399
and you're gonna get
more followers, but Kat,

10:46.401 --> 10:48.483
please, you gotta keep
the followership going up.

10:48.485 --> 10:50.406
Yeah, totally.

10:50.408 --> 10:51.487
Up!

10:53.973 --> 10:55.534
Jane.

10:55.536 --> 10:56.696
You got a minute?

10:56.698 --> 10:58.579
Sure, what's up?

10:58.581 --> 11:00.502
So, tell me,
what do you want to write?

11:00.504 --> 11:01.824
I don't write
for the dot-com.

11:01.826 --> 11:03.507
Unless Jacqueline asks
for something

11:03.509 --> 11:04.589
specifically for digital.

11:04.591 --> 11:07.393
Right, got it.
Old-school.

11:07.395 --> 11:09.517
No, that's cool, that's cool.
I respect that.

11:09.519 --> 11:11.520
Um, but you know, until I find
my full-time digital writer,

11:11.522 --> 11:13.563
it's kind of gotta be
all hands on deck.

11:13.565 --> 11:15.567
It's an old-school term.

11:15.569 --> 11:17.209
Got it.

11:17.211 --> 11:18.932
But what interests you?
Tell me.

11:18.934 --> 11:20.735
You know, it could be anything.
I'm all about honesty.

11:20.737 --> 11:24.621
Well, if I'm being honest,
I guess I'm interested to know

11:24.623 --> 11:26.584
why a man is running
the digital portion

11:26.586 --> 11:28.427
of a woman's magazine.

11:28.429 --> 11:29.910
Wow. Yeah, I love that.

11:29.912 --> 11:31.512
- You do?
- Yeah. Oh, no, totally.

11:31.514 --> 11:32.795
I mean, don't you think
people are gonna

11:32.797 --> 11:34.718
be asking me
that exact same question?

11:34.720 --> 11:37.442
But I feel like
once they get to know me,

11:37.444 --> 11:39.245
they'll understand
that I'm, like,

11:39.247 --> 11:40.928
the perfect guy for the job.

11:40.930 --> 11:45.615
You could be the one
to help them get to know me.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.579
You want me to write
a piece about you?

11:47.581 --> 11:52.026
I mean, yeah,
if you're interested.

11:52.028 --> 11:55.271
And what if I find something
that suggests

11:55.273 --> 11:57.715
that you're not
the right person for the job?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.879
Hmm, well, a good reporter

11:59.881 --> 12:02.924
doesn't shy away
from the truth.

12:02.926 --> 12:04.566
Cool. Well, I'll give you
some names

12:04.568 --> 12:05.848
of people to interview.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.573
Oh, no need.
I'll get people to talk.

12:08.575 --> 12:09.975
Old-school.

12:11.780 --> 12:12.740
Great, cool.

12:12.742 --> 12:14.745
Thanks, Jane.

12:22.724 --> 12:24.244
Hey. Oliver.

12:24.246 --> 12:26.728
So what does Patrick's
fashion sense say about him?

12:26.730 --> 12:28.651
Sprezzatura.

12:28.653 --> 12:30.535
Sp-sprezza... hmm?

12:30.537 --> 12:33.299
The dark, denim jeans
with the casual cuff,

12:33.301 --> 12:35.222
the bright, striped socks,
the white Stans,

12:35.224 --> 12:38.187
the oxford button-down...
sprezzatura.

12:38.189 --> 12:41.472
Perfect imperfection.
Studied carelessness.

12:41.474 --> 12:43.676
Jumbo shrimp!

12:43.678 --> 12:45.238
It's an oxymoron.
Are we not doing oxymorons?

12:45.240 --> 12:47.282
Sit down.
He wants you to think

12:47.284 --> 12:49.165
he didn't put any effort in,
when in actuality,

12:49.167 --> 12:50.367
everything is planned.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.210
Huh.

12:52.212 --> 12:54.413
That helps, thank you.

12:54.415 --> 12:55.776
Please tell your husband
to call me

12:55.778 --> 12:57.338
when he wants to play golf.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.662
Yeah, you and Ian
gotta get on the green.

12:59.664 --> 13:01.345
Last night was fun,
wasn't it?

13:01.347 --> 13:02.507
It was.
Thanks again, Marshall.

13:02.509 --> 13:04.229
Take care.

13:04.231 --> 13:05.431
- Hey!
- Hey.

13:05.433 --> 13:08.797
Was Marshall's annual dinner
last night?

13:08.799 --> 13:10.359
It turned into more
of a welcome party

13:10.361 --> 13:12.242
for Patrick, but it was.

13:12.244 --> 13:14.366
Marshall said that you had
other plans.

13:14.368 --> 13:17.252
No.
We never got an invitation.

13:19.576 --> 13:21.137
I've been invited
to that dinner

13:21.139 --> 13:23.861
for the past five years
with a plus-one.

13:23.863 --> 13:25.584
You think this has
anything to do

13:25.586 --> 13:27.748
with me dating Sutton?

13:27.750 --> 13:30.873
Um, I think maybe
you announcing

13:30.875 --> 13:33.597
your coupledom
at the Scarlet Soiree in Paris

13:33.599 --> 13:35.280
might have raised
a few eyebrows, but...

13:35.282 --> 13:36.682
How about you?

13:36.684 --> 13:38.405
What about me?

13:38.407 --> 13:40.368
It's been a month,
and you haven't

13:40.370 --> 13:42.211
said anything
about me and Sutton.

13:42.213 --> 13:46.218
Well, I just...
I just want you to be happy.

13:46.220 --> 13:49.663
But, of course, I thought
you were happy with Jessica.

13:49.665 --> 13:51.386
Clearly, I was wrong
about that.

13:51.388 --> 13:52.588
Jessica is
a wonderful person.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.351
She is.

13:54.353 --> 13:56.274
I just hope
that you're thinking clearly.

13:56.276 --> 13:58.558
I mean, it's been a really
tough month for you,

13:58.560 --> 14:00.240
with your father passing, and...

14:00.242 --> 14:01.603
Jacqueline.

14:01.605 --> 14:03.446
Sutton and I have had feelings
for each other

14:03.448 --> 14:06.330
long before
my father passed away.

14:06.332 --> 14:09.215
What we have is very real.

14:09.217 --> 14:12.260
I'm glad to hear that.

14:12.262 --> 14:14.624
In fact,
she's moving in with me.

14:14.626 --> 14:16.467
Really?

14:16.469 --> 14:17.709
Wow.
Well, that's wonderful!

14:17.711 --> 14:19.271
I'm really happy for you.

14:19.273 --> 14:20.273
Thank you.

15:09.715 --> 15:12.398
- Kat.
- Hi.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.040
Check your Instagram.

15:14.042 --> 15:15.563
Kerry Washington
just followed you.

15:15.565 --> 15:17.726
So did Sheryl Sandberg.

15:17.728 --> 15:19.690
- Cool.
- Hey, I have an idea.

15:19.692 --> 15:22.454
I want you to speak
at the Scarlet Summit tomorrow.

15:22.456 --> 15:23.736
I'm sorry?

15:23.738 --> 15:25.579
Think about it,
you have so much to draw from.

15:25.581 --> 15:27.582
Your rise to the top
of social media here,

15:27.584 --> 15:28.904
your relationship with Adena,

15:28.906 --> 15:30.427
your experiences coming out.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.512
"Being Queer
in the Digital Age."

15:33.514 --> 15:35.395
You'll find a good angle.

15:35.397 --> 15:37.078
Ooh, I'm excited.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.440
You're gonna be great!

15:38.442 --> 15:39.762
Uh, okay.

15:46.415 --> 15:48.536
- Hello, Andrew.
- Please don't ask my opinion.

15:48.538 --> 15:50.700
Okay, I won't.
Is Jacqueline around?

15:50.702 --> 15:53.104
- No.
- Uh, Sutton. Come on in.

15:53.106 --> 15:56.950
Why am I even here?
Just... go in.

15:59.476 --> 16:01.998
- Hey, Jacqueline.
- Hey.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.160
So, for the Scarlet Summit,

16:03.162 --> 16:05.404
I've got JKOO and Givenchy
for you.

16:05.406 --> 16:07.087
Great, just hang them
on the rack.

16:07.089 --> 16:08.889
- Okay.
- Oh, and Sutton.

16:08.891 --> 16:11.173
- Yeah?
- Congratulations.

16:11.175 --> 16:12.856
On?

16:12.858 --> 16:14.659
Richard told me
that the two of you

16:14.661 --> 16:17.463
are moving in together.

16:17.465 --> 16:20.629
Right. Oh.
Um, yeah! Thank you.

16:30.817 --> 16:33.004
Honestly,
I'm kind of shocked.

16:33.006 --> 16:34.326
I mean, I know
you're used to making

16:34.328 --> 16:35.568
the final decision on things,

16:35.570 --> 16:37.010
but you can't make
my final decision.

16:37.012 --> 16:38.934
No, of course not.

16:38.936 --> 16:42.419
Shouldn't have said anything,
I was just being hopeful.

16:42.421 --> 16:43.821
I wasn't trying to take away

16:43.823 --> 16:45.304
your power
or anything like that.

16:45.306 --> 16:46.626
Well, it kind of
felt that way,

16:46.628 --> 16:48.589
standing in my boss's office,
being congratulated

16:48.591 --> 16:50.272
for a decision
that I didn't make.

16:50.274 --> 16:53.838
Sutton, I am so sorry.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.843
I know.

16:58.648 --> 17:02.251
How about we just... go home?

17:02.253 --> 17:04.255
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.578
I'm gonna go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:12.470 --> 17:15.553
So, did Sutton say anything
about this morning?

17:15.555 --> 17:17.717
Are you seriously looking
for a compliment?

17:17.719 --> 17:19.439
I'm not looking
for an insult.

17:19.441 --> 17:21.321
No, she didn't say anything.

17:21.324 --> 17:22.685
And you can walk around naked
all you want

17:22.686 --> 17:24.327
because she's probably
moving out.

17:24.329 --> 17:25.690
Really?

17:25.692 --> 17:27.733
That's not the effect
I usually have on women.

17:27.734 --> 17:29.977
Not 'cause of you, dummy.

17:29.979 --> 17:31.739
Richard asked her to move in.

17:31.741 --> 17:33.745
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:34.546 --> 17:35.866
Everything's changing.

17:35.868 --> 17:37.589
First, Patrick, now this.

17:37.591 --> 17:38.991
Well, there is
a silver lining.

17:38.993 --> 17:40.594
What's that?

17:40.596 --> 17:42.637
We could walk around naked
together.

17:42.639 --> 17:44.881
Have sex in every room.

17:44.883 --> 17:46.323
That sounds great.

17:46.325 --> 17:47.725
But I still need to find
a roommate

17:47.727 --> 17:49.731
and dirt on Patrick.

17:51.934 --> 17:54.777
Ah. I found something.

17:54.779 --> 17:56.019
There's a gap
in his work history.

17:56.021 --> 17:58.383
Okay.

17:58.385 --> 17:59.945
Lots of people have gaps
in their work history.

17:59.947 --> 18:01.468
You just had a gap.

18:01.470 --> 18:02.630
I'm not a wunderkind.

18:02.632 --> 18:04.352
And it doesn't mention
"Upright,"

18:04.354 --> 18:06.476
but I know that he worked there
when he did his TED Talks,

18:06.478 --> 18:08.038
so why erase it?

18:08.040 --> 18:12.005
- "Upright," huh? Hmm.
- What?

18:12.007 --> 18:14.048
I have a friend
who works at "Upright".

18:14.050 --> 18:15.731
- Call him.
- I don't know.

18:15.733 --> 18:17.694
Please?

18:17.696 --> 18:19.699
Fine.

18:21.102 --> 18:23.383
All I'm gonna say is,
be careful.

18:23.385 --> 18:25.106
This guy is pretty much
your boss.

18:25.108 --> 18:26.989
I am so careful.

18:26.991 --> 18:29.473
I'm just a journalist,
looking for a story.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.515
Right.

18:33.001 --> 18:34.802
Hey, dude, it's Ryan.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.792
Where are you headed?

19:17.794 --> 19:18.954
I'm just gonna go get
a drink, I think.

19:18.956 --> 19:19.995
Wild Susan.

19:19.997 --> 19:21.157
Do you mind if I tag along?

19:21.159 --> 19:22.920
- To a lesbian bar?
- That will work.

19:22.922 --> 19:25.765
Patrick assigned me
a new column,

19:25.767 --> 19:27.007
and I need inspiration.

19:27.009 --> 19:28.770
All right, yeah.

19:28.772 --> 19:30.653
But you have to take a lot
of Insta-stories with me.

19:30.655 --> 19:31.935
My first name
is Insta-Stories.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.617
<i>Okay, cool.</i>

19:33.619 --> 19:35.100
<i>So, "Upright."</i>

19:35.102 --> 19:37.784
Uh, you worked there
with Patrick Duchand?

19:37.786 --> 19:39.988
Sort of.
The girl I hooked up with did.

19:39.990 --> 19:41.951
She's actually the reason
he was fired.

19:41.953 --> 19:43.674
Wait, he was fired
from "Upright"?

19:43.676 --> 19:45.317
For whipping his junk out
at an HR meeting.

19:45.319 --> 19:48.161
You're kidding. Why?

19:48.163 --> 19:49.964
No idea.

19:49.966 --> 19:53.009
Me and Stacey didn't do much
talking, though, so...

19:53.011 --> 19:54.812
Ah.

19:54.814 --> 19:56.735
Well, there's no time
like the present.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.019
Um, I can't print this
without confirmation.

19:59.021 --> 20:01.142
Of course.

20:03.588 --> 20:04.828
Thank you.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.351
Say hi to Ryan for me, okay?

20:06.353 --> 20:08.114
I will.
Nice to meet you.

20:10.239 --> 20:12.120
Bye-bye, Patrick.

20:15.127 --> 20:17.889
Can I get two shots, please?
Thank you.

20:17.891 --> 20:21.295
Ah, ooh, nope.
We should snap this.

20:21.297 --> 20:23.018
Okay, ready?

20:23.020 --> 20:24.180
To more lesbian bars!

20:24.182 --> 20:25.702
To more lesbian bars!

20:27.587 --> 20:29.588
So wait, weren't you on
a social media break?

20:29.590 --> 20:32.994
Was, yes,
but then Patrick pointed out

20:32.996 --> 20:35.037
that I am an extension
of the brand,

20:35.039 --> 20:37.682
and the brand is fabulous,
so now I'm fabulous.

20:37.684 --> 20:39.965
- Thus, you are fantabulous.
- Yeah.

20:39.967 --> 20:40.967
Should we go dance?

20:40.969 --> 20:42.169
Uh... okay.

20:42.171 --> 20:44.132
- Yeah.
- All right.

20:44.134 --> 20:46.055
Uh, guys, I'll catch up
with you.

20:46.057 --> 20:47.297
Jane?

20:47.299 --> 20:48.860
- Stacey?
- Yeah.

20:48.862 --> 20:50.142
Um, thank you so much
for meeting me.

20:50.144 --> 20:52.065
I know it's super last-minute.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.067
Do you want to sit?

20:53.069 --> 20:54.188
Yeah, sure.

20:54.190 --> 20:56.753
So, you knew Patrick?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.195
No, honestly, I didn't,
which is why

20:58.197 --> 20:59.958
the whole thing
was kind of crazy.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.762
Well, you never expect
a coworker to pull down

21:02.764 --> 21:04.245
his pants, no matter how well
you know them.

21:04.247 --> 21:07.290
- No, you don't.
- Uh, so what happened?

21:07.292 --> 21:09.053
Honestly, it happened
a long time ago,

21:09.055 --> 21:11.657
and I don't think
it's really my story to tell.

21:11.659 --> 21:14.141
I understand, but, I mean,
your voice matters,

21:14.143 --> 21:17.987
and you have the chance
to stop the sexist behavior.

21:17.989 --> 21:20.872
Yeah. You're right.

21:20.874 --> 21:23.797
So, why did Patrick Duchand

21:23.799 --> 21:25.319
expose himself at a meeting?

21:25.321 --> 21:27.162
To prove that women
deserve to be paid

21:27.164 --> 21:29.165
just as much as men
for the same job.

21:29.167 --> 21:32.290
And he didn't, like,
expose himself.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.973
He just dropped his pants.

21:35.978 --> 21:37.339
I don't understand.

21:37.341 --> 21:38.981
Well, Patrick and I
had the same job,

21:38.983 --> 21:41.145
but he got all kinds of perks
because he's a guy.

21:41.147 --> 21:43.429
You know, things like
box seats at MSG,

21:43.431 --> 21:44.991
golfing with editors.

21:44.993 --> 21:46.514
And he was always saying
it was bullshit.

21:46.516 --> 21:47.956
And then when he heard
I was making

21:47.958 --> 21:49.438
a thousand less a month
than he was,

21:49.440 --> 21:51.722
he decided to call a meeting
with the both of us with HR.

21:51.724 --> 21:54.286
And they totally denied giving
any kind of special treatment,

21:54.288 --> 21:56.249
which definitely
pissed him off.

21:56.251 --> 21:57.411
And I was standing
right next to him,

21:57.413 --> 21:59.214
and he screamed,
"The only difference

21:59.216 --> 22:03.181
between me and Stacey is this,"
and he pulled down his pants.

22:03.183 --> 22:06.105
Yeah, it was crazy,
but it was one of

22:06.107 --> 22:07.988
the nicest things
anyone's ever done for me.

22:07.990 --> 22:11.274
I'm happy to hear that
you're doing a story on him.

22:11.276 --> 22:12.796
He's a really great guy.

22:16.003 --> 22:19.730
Well, um, thank you
for clarifying.

22:44.285 --> 22:47.128
Hi. Uh, can I get
three vodkas?

22:47.130 --> 22:48.410
Thanks.

23:00.271 --> 23:01.231
Hey!

23:01.233 --> 23:02.353
Yes!

23:02.355 --> 23:04.877
Cheers!

23:09.927 --> 23:13.050
- Oh, my gosh, you're home.
- Hello.

23:13.052 --> 23:15.694
Hi.

23:15.696 --> 23:16.936
What are you doing here?

23:16.938 --> 23:19.981
Oh, I just felt
like being home.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.985
Where were you?

23:21.987 --> 23:23.507
Oh, you know,
just trying to prove

23:23.509 --> 23:26.272
that Patrick is a sexist pig.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.515
But it turns out
he publicly exposed himself

23:28.517 --> 23:31.440
to achieve gender equality,
so... no dice.

23:31.442 --> 23:34.926
- Huh. Wow.
- Yeah.

23:34.928 --> 23:38.331
Um, not complaining,
but why are you here with me?

23:38.333 --> 23:44.501
This whole "moving in
with Richard" thing...

23:44.503 --> 23:46.745
I think it's too soon.

23:46.747 --> 23:49.029
I don't want to lose this.

23:49.031 --> 23:52.434
Or this. Or this.

23:52.436 --> 23:55.800
Well, this will
always be fine.

23:55.802 --> 23:59.285
But I'm happy to hear you
say that.

23:59.287 --> 24:02.330
I want you to be happy,
and I love you and Richard,

24:02.332 --> 24:06.259
but... yeah, I'm not ready
for this chapter to end.

24:08.342 --> 24:10.143
Does that make me a bad friend?

24:10.145 --> 24:12.787
Yes. No.

24:12.789 --> 24:16.273
The only thing it makes you
is honest.

24:16.275 --> 24:18.797
Well, you're welcome
for my honesty.

24:18.799 --> 24:20.159
Thank you for your honesty.

24:22.405 --> 24:24.408
Oh.

24:25.370 --> 24:28.172
You can take that.
I'm not leaving.

24:28.174 --> 24:33.301
Okay.
Uh, hi.

24:33.303 --> 24:35.384
No, I got nothing.

24:35.386 --> 24:38.389
That's okay.
Sutton's here.

24:38.391 --> 24:40.352
I'm gonna hang with her
tonight.

24:40.354 --> 24:42.956
If that's cool.

24:42.958 --> 24:45.082
Okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

24:48.127 --> 24:51.450
So we never got a chance
to talk about this morning.

24:51.452 --> 24:53.013
Scale of 1-10?

24:53.015 --> 24:54.134
I just want to say thank you.

25:00.387 --> 25:02.107
Hey, is this seat taken?

25:02.109 --> 25:05.232
Well, it turns out,
I'm not exactly a hit

25:05.234 --> 25:08.518
at a lesbian bar,
so no, it's all you.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.561
Oh, thank you.

25:10.563 --> 25:12.364
Can't believe you're not a hit.

25:14.369 --> 25:16.170
So how about you?

25:16.172 --> 25:18.013
Find anybody you like?

25:18.015 --> 25:21.619
No. No.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.903
You know, even when
you were on social media,

25:23.905 --> 25:26.347
you never took
this many selfies.

25:26.349 --> 25:28.230
Come on, Kat, what's going on?

25:30.395 --> 25:31.275
The truth.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.360
Well...

25:36.645 --> 25:38.486
You know that saying,

25:38.488 --> 25:41.411
"If you love someone,
then set them free"?

25:41.413 --> 25:45.017
- Of course.
- Yeah, well...

25:45.019 --> 25:49.064
I set Adena free,
and then she didn't come back.

25:50.228 --> 25:51.508
And she's doing great.

25:55.276 --> 25:58.519
And then, today, I, uh,
posted this old photo

25:58.521 --> 26:00.482
of the two of us,
and she liked it,

26:00.484 --> 26:04.689
and I realized that...
well, she's watching.

26:04.691 --> 26:06.973
So is that why we're here?

26:06.975 --> 26:09.136
To show Adena
how great you're doing?

26:09.138 --> 26:11.220
M-maybe.

26:12.744 --> 26:18.111
Gosh.
You are so hard on yourself.

26:18.113 --> 26:20.355
You got your heart broken.

26:20.357 --> 26:23.640
There's no expiration date
on heartbreak.

26:23.642 --> 26:25.443
You move on
when you're ready to move on,

26:25.445 --> 26:30.291
and when you are ready,
you will find someone amazing.

26:30.293 --> 26:32.494
Someone who will never leave.

26:32.496 --> 26:35.098
You're such a good guy, Alex.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.062
Thanks, but it's true.

26:38.306 --> 26:41.509
Now, what do you say
we get out of here?

26:41.511 --> 26:42.350
Yeah.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.477
Oop.

26:46.479 --> 26:49.682
Ooh, are you okay?

26:49.684 --> 26:51.165
Yeah.

26:55.373 --> 26:56.613
- That was weird.
- What are you doing?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.216
Nope.
Shouldn't have done it.

26:58.218 --> 27:01.782
Yeah. Let's, uh...
I'm gonna get you home.

27:01.784 --> 27:04.186
- Okay. Thank you kindly.
- Okay.

27:04.188 --> 27:06.191
- You sure you're good?
- Yeah!

27:08.975 --> 27:12.616
I love "Scarlet" magazine!

27:20.110 --> 27:21.390
Hi.

27:21.392 --> 27:23.032
Hey!

27:23.034 --> 27:24.315
Thanks for setting my alarm.

27:24.317 --> 27:26.558
Figured you could use it.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.321
You okay?

27:28.323 --> 27:30.404
Not really.

27:30.406 --> 27:34.010
But I gotta go practice telling
the world how fabulous I am.

27:34.012 --> 27:35.212
- For my speech.
- Good luck with that.

27:35.214 --> 27:36.294
Thanks.

27:37.578 --> 27:39.179
- You'll kill it.
- All right.

27:39.181 --> 27:42.023
- Jane, Sutton.
- Oh! Hey, Patrick.

27:42.025 --> 27:43.386
- Hi. Betty Who.
- Hi.

27:43.388 --> 27:45.990
- Hi. Sutton.
- Nice to meet you.

27:45.992 --> 27:47.272
- Jane. Big fan.
- Thank you.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.634
Jane, I read the article.

27:48.636 --> 27:50.277
It really works.
You make me look good.

27:50.279 --> 27:51.559
So thank you.

27:51.561 --> 27:53.362
You're so welcome.

27:53.364 --> 27:55.165
- Nice to meet you.
- See you, Patrick.

27:55.167 --> 27:57.168
Good to see you girls.
Have fun.

27:57.170 --> 27:59.452
- You too!
- Oh, he's not going anywhere.

27:59.454 --> 28:00.894
Oh, I'm sorry
that you didn't find

28:00.896 --> 28:02.376
what you were looking for.

28:02.378 --> 28:04.540
It's okay. Hey.
I had fun last night.

28:04.542 --> 28:05.542
So did I.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.506
There's Richard.

28:10.191 --> 28:12.673
I should probably
go talk to him.

28:12.675 --> 28:15.197
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm a little jealous.

28:15.199 --> 28:17.200
Sutton's great.

28:17.202 --> 28:19.364
I bet.

28:19.366 --> 28:21.528
Oh, come on.
You gotta give me something.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.090
I mean, what is she, 26?

28:23.092 --> 28:25.173
And I bet she's flexible too.

28:25.175 --> 28:28.098
Listen, Eli, you are talking
about my girlfriend, here.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.382
And she's smart, talented...

28:30.384 --> 28:33.066
And wildly flexible.

28:33.068 --> 28:34.669
I mean, he has no idea
how flexible.

28:34.671 --> 28:38.155
- Mm.
- And he never will.

28:38.157 --> 28:40.198
Oh, you're married.
That's great.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.600
You should probably work
on that.

28:41.602 --> 28:44.445
I got a feeling
it's not going too well.

28:44.447 --> 28:45.607
It's nice to meet you,
Sutton.

28:45.609 --> 28:47.410
So great to meet you.

28:47.412 --> 28:48.571
See you around.

28:51.298 --> 28:53.259
Wow.

28:53.261 --> 28:55.142
Ladies and gentlemen.

28:55.144 --> 28:59.149
Welcome to the tenth annual
Scarlet Summit.

29:00.633 --> 29:04.317
And our first speaker
is our very own

29:04.319 --> 29:06.320
Kat Edison.

29:06.322 --> 29:07.482
Come on, Kat.

29:07.484 --> 29:09.487
Get up there!

29:17.340 --> 29:19.344
Good morning, "Scarlet."

29:21.347 --> 29:25.231
Oh! It's a great day
to be queer.

29:25.233 --> 29:28.396
Isn't it a great day
to be queer?

29:31.283 --> 29:33.645
We're so lucky
to be alive right now.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.808
To be alive in a time
where we're making

29:35.810 --> 29:38.853
such incredible strides forward
as a community.

29:38.855 --> 29:41.538
We're challenging
heteronormative ideas,

29:41.540 --> 29:43.220
we're fighting the patriarchy,

29:43.222 --> 29:46.506
and we are learning
how to love one another

29:46.508 --> 29:50.672
and accept one another
for exactly who we are.

29:50.674 --> 29:53.397
I'm so grateful.

29:53.399 --> 29:55.881
I'm so, so grateful to have
a platform like "Scarlet,"

29:55.883 --> 29:58.445
to... to share my journey
with all of you

29:58.447 --> 30:02.291
and knowing
that we're in it together.

30:02.293 --> 30:03.533
It's everything.

30:08.383 --> 30:10.545
Hey, you!

30:15.795 --> 30:18.237
- Hey, Kat.
- Hey.

30:18.239 --> 30:20.441
Thank you for asking me
to do that, it was amazing.

30:20.443 --> 30:23.285
- Was it?
- Uh...

30:23.287 --> 30:26.771
Kat, anyone could have
given that speech.

30:26.773 --> 30:32.260
Where were you? There was
nothing specific in there.

30:32.262 --> 30:35.465
Well...
it's hard to be specific

30:35.467 --> 30:36.908
when you're faking it.

30:36.910 --> 30:38.390
I don't... I'm not following.

30:39.874 --> 30:43.799
Before I met Adena,
I was just a straight girl

30:43.801 --> 30:45.922
with commitment issues.

30:45.924 --> 30:48.647
Didn't expect
to fall in love with her.

30:48.649 --> 30:50.650
But I did.

30:50.652 --> 30:52.693
And honestly, it was amazing.

30:52.695 --> 30:56.820
Until, uh, five weeks ago,
when she broke up with me.

30:56.822 --> 30:58.983
In Paris.

30:58.985 --> 31:00.346
That's why I stopped posting

31:00.348 --> 31:02.389
on all of
my personal accounts,

31:02.391 --> 31:05.434
because every time I tried,
I would end up

31:05.436 --> 31:07.758
just looking through
old photos of us,

31:07.760 --> 31:09.801
thinking about all the things
I could've done better,

31:09.803 --> 31:14.328
wondering if I should've fought
for her to stay, and, uh...

31:14.330 --> 31:15.410
then, last night,
I tried to kiss

31:15.412 --> 31:17.854
a friend of mine
because he said

31:17.856 --> 31:19.296
nice things to me at a time

31:19.298 --> 31:20.619
when I really needed
to hear them,

31:20.621 --> 31:23.383
so I really don't think
that I'm the fabulous face

31:23.385 --> 31:25.827
of "Scarlet" as much as I am
just a hot mess.

31:27.712 --> 31:30.675
Is that specific enough
for you?

31:30.677 --> 31:33.399
That should have been
your speech.

31:34.563 --> 31:36.364
People don't want perfection,
Kat.

31:36.366 --> 31:38.648
They want... this.

31:38.650 --> 31:40.371
They want honesty.

31:55.073 --> 31:57.114
Put your hands together,

31:57.116 --> 32:01.441
and give a red-hot
"Scarlet" welcome to Betty Who.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.254
Hi, guys!
I'm so happy to be here!

32:09.256 --> 32:10.376
Thank you for having me.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.225
♪ 3:00 a.m.,
and all my friends ♪

32:16.227 --> 32:20.112

Um, I lied to you guys,
I'm a mess.

33:07.631 --> 33:08.951
About Adena.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.235
Why didn't you say anything?

33:11.237 --> 33:13.238
Because if I told
either of you,

33:13.240 --> 33:14.760
then it would be real,

33:14.762 --> 33:18.486
and I wasn't ready

Thank you.

34:03.281 --> 34:05.285
Anytime.

34:06.046 --> 34:07.566
Hey.

34:07.568 --> 34:09.409
Um, can I ask you a question?

34:09.411 --> 34:10.771
Sure.

34:10.773 --> 34:12.333
The thing that happened
with Eli,

34:12.335 --> 34:13.897
does that happen often?

34:13.899 --> 34:15.980
Yeah, yeah,
I guess it happens.

34:15.982 --> 34:18.424
It's a drag.
I mean, two nights ago,

34:18.426 --> 34:20.748
it was Marshall's
annual board dinner.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.110
We weren't invited.

34:23.112 --> 34:25.074
Oh.

34:25.077 --> 34:28.039
People just assume
that this isn't...

34:28.041 --> 34:30.764
- Serious.
- Right.

34:30.766 --> 34:32.367
And that's why
you told Jacqueline

34:32.369 --> 34:33.809
that I was moving in with you.

34:33.811 --> 34:36.132
- That was so stupid.
- No. It's not.

34:36.135 --> 34:39.458
I really get it.

34:39.460 --> 34:42.503
But the thing is...

34:42.505 --> 34:45.989
we just can't care
what other people think.

34:45.991 --> 34:49.353
'Cause I wasted
a lot of time doing that.

34:49.356 --> 34:50.996
And I almost lost you
because of it.

34:50.998 --> 34:55.524
It's just... harder
than I thought it would be.

34:55.525 --> 34:58.689
We can handle it.
You know why?

34:58.691 --> 35:00.733
'Cause it's me and you
against the world.

35:00.735 --> 35:03.177
And we're good, right?

35:03.179 --> 35:04.178
Right.

35:06.424 --> 35:07.544
Okay.

35:14.557 --> 35:16.879
So that was pretty ballsy,
what you did at "Upright."

35:16.881 --> 35:18.884
No pun intended, I'm sure.

35:20.407 --> 35:23.850
Why didn't you share
your story with the press?

35:23.852 --> 35:26.414
I signed an NDA.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.177
So I couldn't.

35:28.179 --> 35:30.060
- But I could.
- Exactly.

35:30.062 --> 35:32.144
Look, Jane.

35:32.146 --> 35:33.185
I read your pieces.

35:33.187 --> 35:34.708
"Carry the Weight,"

35:34.710 --> 35:37.593
"The Domino Effect"...
you're good.

35:37.595 --> 35:40.718
Your work is thought-provoking,
and it's honest,

35:40.720 --> 35:42.440
even when you don't like
what you find.

35:42.442 --> 35:44.123
So you knew
I would find your story?

35:44.125 --> 35:47.088
I knew a good reporter
would find that story.

35:47.090 --> 35:49.893
Which reminds me, I found
my new full-time writer.

35:49.895 --> 35:51.896
Well, I'm really happy
for you.

35:51.898 --> 35:54.099
Welcome to the digital team,
Jane.

35:54.101 --> 35:56.143
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

36:31.162 --> 36:35.887
We always post
the perfect photo of ourselves,

36:35.889 --> 36:39.213
instead of showing what
we're actually going through.

36:39.215 --> 36:41.256
So...

36:45.104 --> 36:47.586
This is the real me.

36:49.191 --> 36:51.192
Heartbroken.

36:51.194 --> 36:52.715
After breaking up
with the only person

36:52.717 --> 36:54.598
that I've ever really loved.

37:00.129 --> 37:04.133
And my life is amazing,
it really is.

37:04.135 --> 37:07.739
But that doesn't mean
that I'm perfect.

37:07.741 --> 37:08.901
And it doesn't mean
that I don't

37:08.903 --> 37:11.185
make mistakes sometimes.

37:14.312 --> 37:17.034
But... you know what?

37:17.036 --> 37:19.078
I'm... I'm getting there.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.083
I'm figuring it out.

37:23.407 --> 37:27.812
And I think it's about time
that we started...

37:27.814 --> 37:30.416
being more real
with one another.

37:31.820 --> 37:34.262
Sharing how we're
actually feeling.

37:34.264 --> 37:38.629
And being there
for one another.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.789
- I'm ready!
- Okay, but I'm not.

38:02.791 --> 38:06.316
Jane, come on.
It's just us here.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.843
Oh, that makes me happy.

38:11.845 --> 38:14.167
So, how do you feel?

38:14.169 --> 38:17.773
Mm... you're right,
it's kind of liberating.

38:17.775 --> 38:19.936
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

38:19.938 --> 38:21.339
All right, it's your turn.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.342
Oh, finally!

38:30.035 --> 38:32.717
You don't have to worry
about Ben.

38:32.719 --> 38:33.959
Uh...

38:33.961 --> 38:37.084
I know you were
reading up on him.

38:37.086 --> 38:38.406
No, I was just...

38:38.408 --> 38:40.810
Hey.

38:40.812 --> 38:42.533
I chose you.

38:44.178 --> 38:47.341
I know.

38:47.343 --> 38:51.067
I just can't figure out
how I got so lucky.

38:51.069 --> 38:52.990
Same.

39:02.888 --> 39:04.409
<i>So Richard said that dumb
thing because he was</i>

39:04.411 --> 39:06.011
trying to defend
your relationship?

39:06.013 --> 39:07.374
- Yeah.
- Aww.

39:07.376 --> 39:09.898
- That's so sweet.
- I know.

39:09.900 --> 39:11.941
Guess he's just figuring it out
like I am.

39:11.943 --> 39:13.263
Like all of us.

39:13.265 --> 39:17.069
So, are you gonna
move in, or...

39:17.071 --> 39:19.153
Uh... I think
we're just gonna enjoy

39:19.155 --> 39:22.238
where we are right now,
because...

39:22.240 --> 39:24.161
You know, once I...

39:24.163 --> 39:25.804
Look...

39:27.088 --> 39:29.369
Do whatever feels right
for you.

39:29.371 --> 39:31.613
Please don't worry about me.

39:31.615 --> 39:33.857
I know!

39:33.859 --> 39:35.259
But what about
all the in-between moments,

39:35.261 --> 39:37.182
like last night,
when we were eating ice cream

39:37.184 --> 39:39.386
and talking about
Pinstripe's peen-stripe?

39:39.388 --> 39:41.429
We will still have
those moments.

39:41.431 --> 39:43.873
But seriously.

39:43.875 --> 39:48.120
If you want to move in
with Richard, you should.

39:48.122 --> 39:50.003
I'll be fine.

39:50.005 --> 39:51.325
And the apartment's
not going anywhere.

39:51.327 --> 39:54.210
You could come over
whenever you want.

39:54.212 --> 39:56.894
So?

39:56.896 --> 39:58.296
What do you want to do?

40:00.302 --> 40:03.345
I want to move in
with Richard.

40:03.347 --> 40:04.506
Oh, my God!

40:04.508 --> 40:06.950
Yeah!
I can help you pack.

40:06.952 --> 40:08.233
I have a whole system.

40:08.235 --> 40:09.354
Yeah, I bet you do.

40:11.079 --> 40:12.519
All right, for now,
can we just focus

40:12.521 --> 40:14.042
on, uh, packing up these boxes?

40:14.044 --> 40:15.324
- Yes.
- Tape.

40:15.326 --> 40:17.688
- Yes.
- Are you ready?

40:17.690 --> 40:22.375
Not at all, but...
I have to move on.

40:24.541 --> 40:27.704
All right,
where does this go?

40:27.706 --> 40:31.230
You know what?
Just give me one second.

40:50.623 --> 40:52.585
We're really proud of you.

40:52.587 --> 40:54.588
Thanks.

40:54.590 --> 40:57.392
Feels good to be honest.

40:57.394 --> 41:01.279
And look at how many people
you're inspiring.
