WEBVTT

00:08.342 --> 00:10.711
ANNOUNCER: The Weekly.
All new, Sundays at 10:00
on FX.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.514
(dance music)

00:13.547 --> 00:15.949
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Pose.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.520
(motor whirring)

00:37.871 --> 00:39.407
BLANCA:
Why are we the only ones

00:39.440 --> 00:41.442
-out here?
-PRAY TELL: Who wants to come

00:41.475 --> 00:43.377
to the most remote
part of New York?

00:43.411 --> 00:45.346
You'd think people would come
to pay their respects.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.015
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.450
(exhales) I'm tired.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.452
I've been to three funerals
this week.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.187
Three. Where's the cure?

00:53.221 --> 00:55.356
BLANCA:
Look, we got to keep it
together today, Pray.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.291
We got a long day ahead of us.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.059
I know.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.861
I'm sorry, I just...

01:00.894 --> 01:02.896
It upsets me.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.068
(door opens, closes)

01:23.117 --> 01:26.053
His name is... was Keenan.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.289
Keenan Howard.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.758
I'm here to see...
his burial site.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.593
He's a relation of yours?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.395
Not exactly.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.831
We dated, we broke up.
Listen.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.400
He died of pneumonia

01:39.433 --> 01:42.503
-and I was told
he was buried here.
-Here's the thing.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.572
Names don't matter here.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.974
Just a bunch of pine boxes
in a ditch.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.776
-So no headstones?
-Welcome to Hart Island.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.578
Just a mass grave
of people whose families

01:50.611 --> 01:51.945
couldn't afford a burial

01:51.979 --> 01:54.282
or unclaimed bodies
from the morgue.

01:54.315 --> 01:57.251
Infants are out back
in Potter's Field.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.119
We quarantine the ones
that died of AIDS,

01:59.153 --> 02:00.988
don't want them infecting
anyone else, you know.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.990
But they're already dead.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.858
Sweetie, we don't know
how this thing is spread.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.030
Come on, Pray.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.134
(machinery clanking in distance)

02:28.182 --> 02:30.518
How did Keenan end up here?

02:30.551 --> 02:34.121
-I thought he had family.
-No.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.890
Orphaned just like
the rest of us.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.193
After we broke up,
I heard that he had gotten sick

02:39.227 --> 02:41.262
and I tried to reach out.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.334
But I think that he...

02:46.367 --> 02:48.636
he was embarrassed...

02:48.669 --> 02:50.404
about getting sick.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.174
He died alone.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.911
In that tiny studio apartment.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.249
In the dead of summer.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.284
Three weeks before
anybody found him.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.488
Was lying in the heat
for so long,

03:07.521 --> 03:10.324
-I heard that his body just
melted into the mattress.
-Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

03:10.358 --> 03:13.494
I'm not settling
for this, Pray.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.664
We got to do something.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.931
-Right?
-Yeah.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.533
(sniffles)

03:23.771 --> 03:25.773
PRAY TELL:
Only way this isn't
gonna be our reality

03:25.806 --> 03:27.908
is if we help each other.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.379
'Cause they sure as hell
aren't gonna do anything. Trust.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.916
There it is.

03:41.322 --> 03:45.125
Judy told me about this place
and I didn't believe her.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.895
She... she said this island

03:47.928 --> 03:50.063
used to be a tuberculosis ward.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.234
Now it's a burial site.
(sniffles)

03:54.268 --> 03:56.437
Each one of these
heart-shaped rocks

03:56.470 --> 03:58.706
represents someone buried here,

03:58.739 --> 04:01.742
left by someone left behind.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.823
(kisses)

04:29.670 --> 04:31.672
So, what now?

04:33.441 --> 04:34.742
We pray.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.777
(Pray Tell sniffles)

04:38.679 --> 04:40.814
We pray for strength...

04:42.483 --> 04:45.753
...to keep fighting.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.788
Yeah.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.662
(sniffles)

05:04.738 --> 05:06.707
(door opens)

05:06.740 --> 05:08.709
(footfalls approach)

05:08.742 --> 05:11.479
PRAY TELL:
The category is...

05:11.512 --> 05:14.047
Live...

05:14.081 --> 05:16.550
Work...

05:16.584 --> 05:20.320
Pose!

05:23.391 --> 05:25.393
*

05:45.513 --> 05:48.181
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

05:51.619 --> 05:53.587
-Hi, Blanca.
You want to come in?
-Hi. Yeah.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.922
Yeah.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.491
(exhales)

05:57.525 --> 06:00.928
This place is like the Taj Mahal
compared to St. Vincent's.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.362
You know they had me
on a six-week

06:02.396 --> 06:05.365
waiting list just to get
a doctor to read my labs.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.702
By the way, thank you for
squeezing me in like this.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.938
Anything for family, kid.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.407
So, what does it say?

06:13.441 --> 06:14.942
I tried reading my labs
when I picked it up,

06:14.975 --> 06:18.178
but... it all looked like
Klingon to me.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.780
Well, your red blood cells
are good.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.849
-I'm just checking out
your CD4s.
-See?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.851
There you go again
speaking that Klingon.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.218
English, please?

06:25.252 --> 06:28.956
CD4s, or T-cells,
are what we want a lot of.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.392
So... how many I gots?

06:32.426 --> 06:33.694
'Cause I know I got a lot.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.962
I stopped drinking,

06:34.995 --> 06:36.464
I take my Flintstone vitamins
every day.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.132
Well, sometimes being healthy
isn't enough for this virus.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.802
Your T-cells have fallen
bellow 200.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.737
What's...
So? What's that mean?

06:43.771 --> 06:46.039
It means we have to start
monitoring you once a month

06:46.073 --> 06:47.708
instead of every three months.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.277
And we have to move your
diagnosis of being HIV-positive

06:50.310 --> 06:51.912
to having AIDS.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.415
What?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.666
S...

07:12.700 --> 07:14.802
So I have AIDS now?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.338
Well, it's-it's just a number.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.475
It's a way of flagging
how much care a patient needs.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.076
Nah, I've been feeling fine.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.778
I've been feeling
amazing, actually.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.180
Last winter,
when my kids got sick,

07:27.214 --> 07:29.116
I didn't have a sniffle at all.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.151
I mean, sometimes you can't tell
what HIV is doing

07:31.184 --> 07:33.987
-to your immune system.
-So I'm dying.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.589
No.
You're not dying.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.925
You still have plenty
of T-cells to fight with,

07:37.958 --> 07:40.427
but we can't let those numbers
drop any lower.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.795
So what do I do?

07:41.829 --> 07:44.097
It ain't no cure for this thing.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.499
Not yet.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.703
But there is this.

07:49.737 --> 07:53.373
AZT. It helps slow
the progression of the virus

07:53.406 --> 07:56.376
-and it's all we've got.
-Ain't that stuff for rich folk?

07:56.409 --> 07:58.546
Well, pharmaceutical companies
are in the business

07:58.579 --> 08:00.848
of making a profit,
but there are folks

08:00.881 --> 08:03.316
in our community who care
about the less fortunate.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.386
And they're the ones who can
get us this shit for free.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.824
When the wealthy white queens
and their friends know

08:10.858 --> 08:14.361
that the end is coming close,
they call us.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.932
It's the same thing every time.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.238
We pay our respects.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.408
We say our goodbyes.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.679
And then we collect
the leftover meds.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.715
Their dying wishes
are to make sure that the grief

08:34.748 --> 08:37.217
isn't the only thing
they're leaving behind.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.387
Some of them
just have antibiotics.

08:41.889 --> 08:45.025
But the rich ones
always have AZT.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.526
BLANCA:
Pray Tell told me about

08:46.560 --> 08:49.029
a friend of his
who was on these meds.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.868
He said it was
as toxic as chemo.

08:54.902 --> 08:59.006
And once he got on 'em,
his body completely gave out.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.908
Blanca, I'm gonna
be straight with you

09:00.941 --> 09:02.542
because you need to hear this.

09:02.576 --> 09:06.246
You're in denial of what HIV
is doing to your body.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.848
If you don't do something
about it soon, you're

09:07.881 --> 09:09.883
-gonna be dead in six months.
-No.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.419
Listen, they're working on
new drugs every day.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.187
You just got to stay alive
long enough

09:14.221 --> 09:15.889
for something better
to come along.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.062
You know...

09:22.095 --> 09:23.731
it's moments like these
that make your life

09:23.764 --> 09:26.266
flash right before you.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.036
Crazy thing is,
it's... not my life

09:29.069 --> 09:32.072
I'm seeing right now,
it's my kids.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.074
It's my kids.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.879
(takes deep breath)

09:38.912 --> 09:42.049
Everything in this life is
set up to work against them.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.951
There is still

09:43.984 --> 09:46.720
so much in their lives
that I have to fix.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.056
We have a saying around here:

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
either get busy living,

09:51.124 --> 09:53.994
or you get busy dying.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.765
And you've got a lot
to live for.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.137
(Angel chuckles)

10:04.171 --> 10:05.639
-(camera whirring)
-LIL PAPI: Darling.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.140
That one's gonna be good.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.142
-(Angel chuckles)
-(camera whirring)

10:09.176 --> 10:10.610
LIL PAPI:
Yeah.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.013
-Hey, can you do me a favor?
-ANGEL: Stop.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.982
LIL PAPI:
Just look this way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.684
Right there, right there.
Give me that smile.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.689
That one's great, actually.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.957
Um... yeah.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.458
* What are you looking at? *

10:25.492 --> 10:26.860
(chuckles)

10:26.894 --> 10:28.595
("Vogue" by Madonna playing)

10:28.628 --> 10:30.630
(camera whirring)

10:32.132 --> 10:34.501
*

10:43.643 --> 10:45.312
* Strike a pose... *

10:45.345 --> 10:47.347
(warmer beeps)

10:51.084 --> 10:52.185
* Vogue, Vogue... *

10:52.219 --> 10:53.687
Oh, shit. (laughs)

10:53.721 --> 10:55.288
Y'all hear that?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.725
(chuckles)

10:57.758 --> 10:59.392
CHANEL:
That's the new Madonna single.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.995
It's been on constant repeat
on Z100.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.631
-(Blanca whoops)
-It's gonna be the song
of the summer.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.001
The most famous woman in
the world signing about us.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.137
-Mm! (chuckles)
-Strike a pose.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.206
The category is...

11:13.240 --> 11:15.308
Runway...

11:15.342 --> 11:16.576
Mo-del...

11:16.609 --> 11:18.746
-Effect.
-(crowd cheering)

11:18.779 --> 11:20.413
BLANCA:
Everything is about to change.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.315
I can see it as clear as day.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.517
Well, your vision must be cloudy

11:24.551 --> 11:27.687
'cause ain't shit about
to change for our black asses.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.557
Madonna is shining a bright
spotlight on us, girl.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.659
-(scoffs)
-We've been underground
for how long?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.995
About 20 years.
Since Crystal LaBeija lost

11:35.028 --> 11:38.365
one too many titles
to white girls.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.434
PRAY TELL:
Ha-ha! Yes, baby!

11:41.468 --> 11:43.170
Let us have it.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.172
These walks
are turning me on, kids.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.374
Who's next?

11:47.407 --> 11:50.077
Oh... sookie, sookie, now.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.079
* Fred Astaire,
Ginger Rogers... *

11:52.112 --> 11:54.848
PRAY TELL:
Are you gonna show us
your face, baby?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.917
* Rita Hayworth
gave good face... *

11:56.950 --> 11:59.619
(crowd cheering)

11:59.652 --> 12:01.221
That's my baby!

12:01.254 --> 12:03.256
* Ladies with an attitude *

12:03.290 --> 12:05.692
* Fellows that were
in the mood... *

12:05.725 --> 12:07.194
BLANCA:
Mark my words.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.628
"Vogue" will make us stars.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.031
Madonna lives on the edge
for what's next.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.968
And what's newer than
an entire world, undiscovered,

12:15.002 --> 12:17.938
brimming to the rim with guts,

12:17.971 --> 12:20.640
gorgeousness...

12:20.673 --> 12:22.175
and raw talent?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.812
I mean, look.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.316
CROWD (chanting):
Angel! Angel! Angel...

12:29.349 --> 12:31.952
(crowd cheering)

12:31.985 --> 12:33.386
PRAY TELL:
Get up, get up.

12:33.420 --> 12:37.224
Oh! Booty! Booty! Booty! Booty!

12:37.257 --> 12:39.092
(crowd cheering, chanting)

12:39.126 --> 12:40.828
PRAY TELL:
Don't, don't, don't hurt us.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.296
Don't hurt us, baby.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.998
Madonna's gonna want
our faces and when she comes

12:45.032 --> 12:48.101
with her spotlight, the
Evangelistas are gonna be ready.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.970
-Girl...
-PRAY TELL: Judges have spoken.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.172
The cards never lie.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.307
The cards never lie,
my darlings.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.110
Grand prize goes to...

12:57.144 --> 12:59.312
the most luminous girl
in the room...

12:59.346 --> 13:02.282
Miss Angel Evangelista.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.351
CROWD (chanting):
Evangelista!

13:05.819 --> 13:08.155
(chanting continues)

13:08.188 --> 13:09.957
-Evange...
-Evange...

13:09.990 --> 13:12.359
-...lista!
-...lista!

13:12.392 --> 13:14.327
-Evange...
-Evange...

13:14.361 --> 13:17.364
-...lista!
-...lista!

13:17.397 --> 13:19.799
* Vogue, Vogue, Vogue, Vogue. *

13:48.728 --> 13:50.730
Hey, baby.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.299
Girl, what are you doing
out here?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.667
We talked about this.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.070
You said you wasn't gonna
walk the piers no more.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.006
-There are more options
out there.
-Like what?

13:59.039 --> 14:01.641
Mopping floors
and waiting tables? No.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.077
No, thanks.
I like being my own boss.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.179
BLANCA:
Well, I got a plan.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.248
Get in.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.887
Just tell me where we're going.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.089
I was at work
and I was flipping through

14:16.123 --> 14:19.927
Elle magazine while I was
on my lunch break and...

14:19.960 --> 14:23.730
I saw this advertisement
for a modeling contest.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.066
(Angel scoffs)

14:27.767 --> 14:30.203
Do you see her?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.604
Yes.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.073
I'm not the face
they're looking for.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.142
-I ain't no model.
-Yes, you are.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.446
Look at these.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.114
That's just me and Lil Papi
playing around.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.515
BLANCA:
Do you see what I see?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.185
These photos prove
you got the look.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.888
You've got a light
that shines so bright

14:48.922 --> 14:50.523
right inside of you,

14:50.557 --> 14:53.560
and I just wish
you could see it. Plus,

14:53.593 --> 14:55.628
we about to go mainstream
with this Madonna song.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.430
Mainstream?

14:57.464 --> 15:00.300
-Yeah, until they find out
who I really am.
-Oh, girl.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.935
All we need to get
is our foot into the door.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.371
This song is our ticket
to acceptance.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.905
Once they see
that you're in the ball,

15:05.939 --> 15:07.774
they won't even turn you away.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.479
(Blanca chuckles)

15:23.623 --> 15:25.625
* My Lord *

15:25.658 --> 15:26.793
(humming)

15:26.826 --> 15:29.062
Sing, sister Lulu.

15:29.096 --> 15:33.800
Girl, who the hell chose
those tacky-ass flowers?

15:33.833 --> 15:35.668
All these candles
and flaming homos,

15:35.702 --> 15:38.071
surprised God don't
burn this bitch to the ground.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.840
(both laugh)

15:40.873 --> 15:43.476
Funerals are bullshit.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.512
(hums):
Mm-hmm.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.581
(laughs)
I want a head count

15:48.615 --> 15:52.185
of exactly how many people
love me before I die.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.620
-Mm.
-And I want a chance

15:53.653 --> 15:55.455
to defend myself,
in case anyone even try

15:55.488 --> 15:57.190
to tarnish my good name.

15:57.224 --> 16:01.261
What's the point of spending
all that money on a corpse?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.763
Give me my damn flowers
when I can smell them.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.832
And give me a chance to read
all these bitches

16:05.865 --> 16:07.367
before I'm put in the
motherfucking ground.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.501
(laughs)

16:08.535 --> 16:10.770
Y'all are some hard-hearted hos.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.240
Show some damn respect.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.644
(organ music playing quietly)

16:21.581 --> 16:24.117
Well, she's on CP time tonight.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.619
He's not going anywhere.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.055
-(scoffs)
-(sighs)

16:28.088 --> 16:32.059
What's your head count?
This is my 452nd memorial.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.393
Two hundred and ten.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.896
First one to get to a thousand
gets a free toaster.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.731
-(chuckles) Uh...
-(giggling nearby)

16:38.765 --> 16:41.534
Look at these unquenchable hos
thirsting for dick.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.504
Since when did funerals become
the new cruising spot?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.739
Oh, she's found morality.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.708
(laughs)

16:48.741 --> 16:50.843
Come on.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.945
Let's pay our respects.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.818
Interesting choice.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.854
Why is he dressed like
a flamenco dancer?

17:01.888 --> 17:04.924
I can get over the outfit,
but that makeup is terrible.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.396
Joe always preferred
a nude matte lip.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.431
Well, red is a tough color.

17:11.464 --> 17:15.168
Only tramps can pull it off.
Shocking you never could.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.971
(chuckles, cries)

17:22.875 --> 17:24.611
(sniffles)

17:24.644 --> 17:26.413
Oh...

17:27.980 --> 17:29.782
He was so young.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.220
Just barely started living.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.589
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

17:36.623 --> 17:40.260
-790, until you get
your toaster.
-(exhales)

17:40.293 --> 17:44.197
(laughs)

17:44.231 --> 17:48.101
(groans) I need a drink.
You coming with me to the diner?

17:48.135 --> 17:51.438
Not tonight. I've got someplace
to be and you're coming with me.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.973
PRAY TELL:
Where are you taking me?

17:54.006 --> 17:56.309
-I'm hungry.
-(crowd chanting)

17:56.343 --> 17:58.145
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.547
My black ass does not need
to join your group

18:00.580 --> 18:04.083
of preppy white queens
and ill-fitted Gap chinos

18:04.117 --> 18:06.819
who have never had to fight for
a goddamn thing in their lives.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.489
-CROWD: Act up! Fight back!
-Listen, there are dikes, too,

18:09.522 --> 18:13.260
running these meetings,
of all shades.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.929
Pray, you've got to
put your pain to good use,

18:16.963 --> 18:20.633
or I swear to God,
it will eat you alive.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.935
CROWD (chanting):
Fight back! Fight AIDS!

18:22.969 --> 18:26.606
Act up! Fight back!
Fight AIDS!

18:26.639 --> 18:29.809
Act up!
Fight back! Fight AIDS!

18:29.842 --> 18:32.912
Act up! Fight back!
Fight AIDS!

18:32.945 --> 18:35.682
Act up!
Fight back! Fight AIDS!

18:35.715 --> 18:38.618
Welcome to your first
Act Up meeting.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.620
CROWD (chanting):
Fight AIDS! Act up!

18:40.653 --> 18:45.758
Ah, well, I was beginning to
think Miss Wanda didn't exist.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.360
I'm not the going out type.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.929
I've got other things
on my mind.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.633
-I told you she was hot.
-(chuckles)

18:53.666 --> 18:56.203
-Act up! Fight back! Fight AIDS!
-SYD: All right.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.338
-All right.
-(applause, cheering)

18:58.371 --> 19:00.473
Listen up, folks.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.875
Last week's fund-raiser
brought in

19:02.909 --> 19:06.279
$650,000.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.881
(cheering)

19:08.915 --> 19:13.119
And... and now that
we finally have the cash

19:13.152 --> 19:15.655
to meet our momentum,
this Sunday's protest

19:15.688 --> 19:17.290
up at St. Patrick's Cathedral

19:17.324 --> 19:19.626
is an even more crucial step

19:19.659 --> 19:22.295
in starting a global
conversation around HIV

19:22.329 --> 19:23.496
and AIDS.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.233
(cheering)

19:26.266 --> 19:29.402
The Catholic Church has spent

19:29.436 --> 19:32.739
millions of dollars putting
the false message into the world

19:32.772 --> 19:36.576
that condoms don't work and that
abstinence is the only way

19:36.609 --> 19:39.011
-to fight HIV. That is a lie.
-(booing)

19:39.045 --> 19:42.349
And that is morally wrong.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.684
So, we're staging a die-in

19:44.717 --> 19:46.853
in the middle
of that congregation

19:46.886 --> 19:49.922
as a peaceful protest
against the annihilation

19:49.956 --> 19:53.092
-of our community!
-Yes!

19:53.125 --> 19:55.528
(cheering)

19:58.598 --> 19:59.999
Cardinal John O'Connor has said,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.502
"Good morality
is good medicine."

20:02.535 --> 20:04.371
He might as well say,
"Let them get AIDS."

20:04.404 --> 20:06.339
And it's not just
the board of education

20:06.373 --> 20:08.074
or the city council

20:08.107 --> 20:10.277
that Cardinal O'Connor
is influencing, no.

20:10.310 --> 20:15.114
He has a direct line
to the Pope himself.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.050
We will not allow his racist,

20:18.084 --> 20:22.555
sexist, homophobic ideologies
to affect the health

20:22.589 --> 20:25.858
of every single person
on this planet!

20:25.892 --> 20:27.260
(cheering)

20:29.729 --> 20:31.798
Act up! Fight back!

20:31.831 --> 20:33.366
ALL:
Fight AIDS!

20:33.400 --> 20:37.370
Act up! Fight back!
Fight AIDS!

20:37.404 --> 20:39.739
Act up!
Fight back! Fight AIDS!

20:39.772 --> 20:44.110
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-Act up! Fight back! Fight AIDS!

20:44.143 --> 20:47.213
Act up! Fight back!
Fight AIDS!

20:47.246 --> 20:50.583
Act up!
Fight back! Fight AIDS!

20:50.617 --> 20:53.286
Act up! Fight back!
Fight AIDS!

20:55.455 --> 20:57.256
(laughing)

20:57.290 --> 20:59.726
Damn, all these girls
look the same.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.828
-Nothing at all like me.
-Girl, stop comparing yourself.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.996
You are an original,
a star of ballroom.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.334
I got to ask you
something serious.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.471
You think I pass?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.473
Hmm. With the best of them.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.008
None of these girls can
hold a candle to you.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.977
Angel, you're the prettiest
thing I've ever seen.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.614
You Dominicans
got a slick tongue.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.015
-Come on.
-(laughs)

21:23.049 --> 21:25.618
We need to sign you in.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.456
(chuckles)
This your first time?

21:29.489 --> 21:32.859
-Don't be nervous.
-I'm not.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.527
Well, I was in your same spot
three years ago,

21:34.561 --> 21:36.095
and I was scared as hell.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.464
I thought my skin
and frizzy hair

21:37.497 --> 21:39.332
wouldn't get me
past the open call,

21:39.366 --> 21:41.801
but those things actually
made me stand out.

21:41.834 --> 21:45.304
You're gonna be the face
of 1990, girl. Watch.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.006
Okay, now hurry up
and fill this out.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.775
And don't forget to mention
that you can Vogue

21:48.808 --> 21:50.109
-in the special skills section.
-Oh, that's right.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.744
Duh.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.725
(quietly):
Come on, let's go.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.127
Blanca, you can't
leave me here like this.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.863
Girl, if I walk into that room,
you know the jig is up.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.668
-You must do this
on your own, Angel.
-(moans)

22:15.702 --> 22:17.537
You got this, you can do this.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.271
Just be yourself.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.075
Just be yourself.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.553
*

23:00.246 --> 23:02.248
(indistinct chatter)

23:04.250 --> 23:05.718
(shutter clicks)

23:14.727 --> 23:17.263
So, what have we here?

23:19.165 --> 23:22.234
Angel. 22.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.804
-Mm-hmm.
-The Bronx.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.576
You used an instant camera.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.478
Yes. I did.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.047
Hmm.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.083
Impressive.

23:38.317 --> 23:41.153
But if you want to be
a professional,

23:41.187 --> 23:44.591
you need a professional
to capture you.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.559
That sounds like
that costs money.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.227
I don't have a job right now,
that's why I'm here

23:48.260 --> 23:49.261
talking to you.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.263
Every model must pay her dues

23:51.297 --> 23:53.432
before she gets paid herself.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.603
It's an investment
in your future.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.907
-So, you can Vogue.
-Mm-hmm.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.875
-Like the new song?
-Mm-hmm.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.879
I like that.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.216
(chuckles)

24:17.890 --> 24:20.493
Here's a photographer I know.

24:20.527 --> 24:23.429
Tell him I sent you.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.797
He'll give you my discount.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.838
Bring the new photographs
to me...

24:31.871 --> 24:34.373
for the semi-finals.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.226
I did it.
I made it to the next round.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.895
-Ah!
-I knew it. I knew it!

24:55.928 --> 24:58.230
(all laughing)

25:08.608 --> 25:11.477
*

25:11.510 --> 25:13.580
Did you put oregano in my sauce?

25:13.613 --> 25:15.848
Your sauce? It's Ragú.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.084
This shit came out of a jar,
bitch. Relax.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.318
-(laughing)
-What's so funny, Cubby?

25:19.351 --> 25:21.420
What's wrong with oregano?
I thought it was healthy

25:21.453 --> 25:23.556
to eat more green vegetables.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.759
Oregano is a herb,
not a vegetable, darling boy.

25:26.793 --> 25:30.029
Who is educating these children
on their nutrition?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.363
And when is your man
coming home?

25:31.397 --> 25:34.601
Well, darling sir, the
Al B. Sure tour is almost over.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.736
He told me he would be home
next week.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.371
I'm so excited,
I can't even sleep. (chuckles)

25:39.405 --> 25:42.274
Oh, no. Please don't go planning
no romantic reunion dinner

25:42.308 --> 25:43.776
at Roy Rogers or nothing.
If he's back in town,

25:43.810 --> 25:45.578
then he's back under my roof,

25:45.612 --> 25:47.614
and Friday family dinner
is mandatory.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.081
Yeah, unless you're glued
to the MTV

25:49.115 --> 25:50.516
waiting for your favorite song
to come on.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.784
Uh-uh. That ain't
recreation, girl.

25:51.818 --> 25:55.021
They play that Madonna
"Vogue" video once an hour.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.357
I need to study it
and I ain't got no VCR.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.626
Listen, y'all are just
not getting it.

25:59.659 --> 26:03.029
We are on the cusp
of a revolution.

26:03.062 --> 26:06.065
We've been doing those dance
moves in that video for years.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.868
That's our culture on MTV.
We about to go mainstream.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.772
Yes. Just like when
all those suburban kids

26:12.805 --> 26:15.642
started singing "Y.M.C.A."
and the leather bars

26:15.675 --> 26:17.644
in The Castro went mainstream.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.878
-(all chuckling)
-This is different.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.713
We're talking about Madonna.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.481
Something is happening,
I can feel it.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.116
PRAY TELL:
Yeah. That's the same shit
they said

26:24.150 --> 26:25.752
about disco.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.987
Studio 54 stayed open
for three years,

26:28.020 --> 26:29.656
and when the Man shut it down,

26:29.689 --> 26:32.725
all those angry black
and homo-hating white boys--

26:32.759 --> 26:36.663
they took their disco records
to the baseball stadium

26:36.696 --> 26:38.564
and blew 'em up.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.466
Every generation

26:40.499 --> 26:42.301
thinks that
they're gonna be the ones

26:42.334 --> 26:44.470
that are finally
invited to the party.

26:44.503 --> 26:46.973
-(both chuckle)
-Put your glass slippers away,

26:47.006 --> 26:49.676
Trans-erella. It ain't never
gonna happen. (laughs)

26:49.709 --> 26:52.444
Really?
Angel, will you

26:52.478 --> 26:55.147
-tell them your news?
-ANGEL: Mm-hmm. Blanca made me

26:55.181 --> 26:57.449
audition for the Fresh Faces
modeling competition.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.618
And she made the semi-finals,
too. What's good?

26:59.652 --> 27:00.820
-(cheering)
-Why you got to
steal my thunder?

27:00.853 --> 27:03.255
DAMON:
Our girl's a star.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.957
Don't get all crazy yet.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.526
The modeling woman said
I need professional headshots,

27:07.559 --> 27:09.862
-and those "costeses" money.
-Mm-hmm.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.764
And you next, Damon.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.666
No more Saturdays sitting
around the house,

27:13.700 --> 27:14.967
reading dirty magazines.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.803
From 3:00 until 5:00,
you're gonna be teaching

27:16.836 --> 27:18.537
a Voguing class
down at the YMCA.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.606
-They don't have
a Voguing class.
-Well, they do now.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.641
I told them if they
put up a sign-up sheet,

27:22.675 --> 27:24.110
more people would come.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.146
They got six people already and
the numbers are going to grow.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.481
Y'all need to trust
this mother's intuition.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.117
Y'all are whistling
past the graveyard.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.118
BLANCA:
Really?

27:32.151 --> 27:33.385
'Cause I heard the other emcees

27:33.419 --> 27:35.788
talking about how Sue Simmons
from Live at Five

27:35.822 --> 27:37.223
wants to interview you
about the scene.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.459
It's not a scene.
It's our lives.

27:40.492 --> 27:44.030
Why do you have to be
such a downer?

27:44.063 --> 27:45.397
PRAY TELL:
We should all be going

27:45.431 --> 27:47.399
to that church
for the protest on Sunday.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.069
Together.
As a house.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.238
I can't make it on Sunday.
I have to meet the photographer.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.339
Reschedule.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.342
We're all being chased
by the same monster.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.045
You saying it's wrong for me
to get a little something

27:59.078 --> 28:00.679
for myself
while I'm running away?

28:00.713 --> 28:03.883
I could die,
so I should stop living?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.317
Come on.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.819
BLANCA:
But we need to let them know

28:06.853 --> 28:08.821
-that we care about us.
-(door opens)

28:08.855 --> 28:11.490
Y'all are going. What's the
point of raising the profile

28:11.523 --> 28:13.225
of our community
if there's no community left

28:13.259 --> 28:15.027
within a couple of years?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.530
You're late, Elektra.

28:18.564 --> 28:21.067
From the looks of things,
not late enough.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.701
Mother Blanca,
this house is suffering

28:22.735 --> 28:25.404
from a major deficiency
in terms of closet space.

28:25.437 --> 28:29.108
I do not understand how you
expect me to just toss my finery

28:29.141 --> 28:31.177
on one of these flea-filled
reclamation projects

28:31.210 --> 28:33.012
like a savage.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.182
What kind of tips
is you making at, um,

28:36.215 --> 28:38.785
-Indochine to buy this mink?
-(Lil Papi chuckles)

28:38.818 --> 28:41.053
She mopped this shit
from the coat room.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.955
Miss Elektra does not mop.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.256
LEMAR:
Or dust

28:44.290 --> 28:46.058
-or cook.
-CUBBY: Mm-hmm.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.694
LEMAR:
Or wash a dish.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.930
But she has been helping
with the rent and expenses

28:50.963 --> 28:52.765
for the past two months,
which I can say

28:52.799 --> 28:54.566
more than any of you freeloaders
have done.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.235
Thank you, Mother Blanca.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.471
And I do apologize
for missing last week's supper.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.373
While I don't always
enjoy the company

29:01.407 --> 29:03.075
and the sauce could use
some seasoning,

29:03.109 --> 29:05.644
I do think it's good for morale
to do things as a family.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.046
BLANCA:
Well, good, because

29:07.079 --> 29:08.881
we're all going with Pray

29:08.915 --> 29:11.918
to that big Act Up protest
at the church on Sunday.

29:13.485 --> 29:14.486
Count me out.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.789
I'm not posing for a mug shot.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.991
Oh, no, uh-uh. Ain't none
of y'all ever given me lip

29:19.025 --> 29:21.627
when I say we're walking a
category together at the ball.

29:21.660 --> 29:24.596
Well, this Sunday,
the ball is at the church,

29:24.630 --> 29:28.600
and the categories are family
and standing up for ourselves

29:28.634 --> 29:32.271
and our community,
and all of y'all are going.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.106
-All right.
-Okay.

29:39.979 --> 29:43.015
I just booked you
an 11:10 and a 12:15.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.283
I'm sorry, Ms. Rose.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.018
You gonna have to give this
to someone else.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.453
I'm the owner,
I need you to work.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.488
You know I never turn down work,

29:49.521 --> 29:51.123
but my friends
are counting on me.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.325
You're ungrateful.
I let you work here

29:53.359 --> 29:55.194
because I am
a good Christian and...

29:55.227 --> 29:57.796
Please. I have to leave.

29:57.830 --> 29:58.831
So quit.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.634
You know what?

30:06.405 --> 30:09.208
You're right. I quit.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.944
I'm not wasting whatever time
I have left on this Earth

30:11.978 --> 30:14.646
to give any part of me to you.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.515
You should kiss my feet
for hiring you.

30:16.548 --> 30:19.218
No one else will.
You will see.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.254
Ladies like getting
their nails done by ladies.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.530
So... then I'll get
my own salon,

30:31.563 --> 30:35.067
and make twice the business
you make in here.

30:35.101 --> 30:39.471
Oh, and I'll call it Vogue Nails
after the Madonna song.

30:39.505 --> 30:43.809
Then when I get back, I'll come
buy this dump from you.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.844
(organ playing, choir singing)

30:54.520 --> 30:57.723
Mm... This look
like a lot of money.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.026
Mm-hmm. And you know
they ain't paying taxes

31:00.059 --> 31:02.028
on any of this shit.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.196
I bet you those vestments cost
more than Chanel's

31:04.230 --> 31:07.266
-entire spring 1990 collection.
-Hmm.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.268
O'CONNOR:
...and all the others,

31:09.301 --> 31:10.336
and I warn them now
while absent,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.104
as I did when present

31:12.138 --> 31:14.040
on my second visit,

31:14.073 --> 31:17.343
that if I come again,
I will not be lenient,

31:17.376 --> 31:20.346
since you are looking
for proof of Christ

31:20.379 --> 31:22.548
speaking in me.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.351
Finally, brothers, rejoice.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.354
Mend your ways,
encourage one another.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.089
Agree with one another.

31:30.122 --> 31:33.292
Live in peace,
and the God of love

31:33.325 --> 31:35.294
and peace will be with you.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.097
Greet one another
with a holy kiss...

31:38.130 --> 31:40.933
-All the holy ones greet you.
-(whispers): Pass it down.

31:40.967 --> 31:44.937
May the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ, the love of God

31:44.971 --> 31:49.141
and the fellowship of
the Holy Spirit be with you all.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.944
CONGREGATION:
And also with you.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.880
O'CONNOR:
The gospel of the Lord.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.316
CONGREGATION:
Praise be to Jesus Christ.

31:57.349 --> 32:00.752
O'CONNOR:
Today's reading really
reminded me of my father.

32:00.786 --> 32:03.089
Paul's letter
to the Corinthians.

32:03.122 --> 32:06.925
It's written with love.
But it's... (coughs)

32:06.959 --> 32:08.427
(congregation muttering)

32:27.313 --> 32:31.517
Could everyone here
please stand and pray?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.454
Prayer won't cure AIDS.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.956
Prayer won't stop
the spread of HIV.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.491
Only condoms will.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.493
Abstinence is not
a human solution,

32:41.527 --> 32:44.130
abstinence is the erasure
of our sexuality.

32:44.163 --> 32:48.700
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

32:48.734 --> 32:51.103
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

32:51.137 --> 32:52.471
Stop killing us!

32:52.504 --> 32:53.672
(chanting):
Stop killing us!

32:53.705 --> 32:55.374
Stop killing us!

32:55.407 --> 32:58.710
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

32:58.744 --> 33:01.980
Stop killing us! Stop
killing us!

33:02.014 --> 33:05.151
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

33:05.184 --> 33:06.518
Stop killing us!

33:06.552 --> 33:07.686
-(chanting continues)
-(door opens)

33:07.719 --> 33:09.788
(whistle blowing)

33:09.821 --> 33:13.459
(indistinct shouting)

33:13.492 --> 33:15.494
-(applause)
-(cheering)

33:17.429 --> 33:19.365
-Get 'em out of here!
-Get out of here!

33:19.398 --> 33:21.033
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

33:21.067 --> 33:23.902
Arrest the cardinal!
He's the criminal!

33:23.935 --> 33:26.705
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

33:26.738 --> 33:32.010
Stop killing us! Stop killing
us! Stop killing us!

33:32.044 --> 33:33.779
Shame on you.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.417
Stop killing us!
Stop killing us!

33:38.450 --> 33:40.319
(shouting)

33:40.352 --> 33:42.654
Stop killing us!

33:42.688 --> 33:45.357
(cheering, applause)

33:45.391 --> 33:47.759
(chanting continues)

33:49.928 --> 33:52.398
Stop killing us!

33:54.266 --> 33:57.503
-I love this hairstyle so much.
-ANDRE: Give me the room.

33:57.536 --> 34:02.274
How many looks are we shooting?

34:02.308 --> 34:05.111
I was thinking just one.

34:05.144 --> 34:08.013
-I can't afford a full-on shoot.
-That's not how it works.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.015
We have a whole team
booked for today.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.851
Well, maybe we could work
something out.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.854
Like, layaway?

34:15.887 --> 34:19.024
-Don't you have a job?
-Not at this moment.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.094
You know, I've seen you
at the piers.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.899
You must have mistaken me
for someone else.

34:27.933 --> 34:32.271
-I have one of those faces.
-No, you don't.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.506
A face like yours
I'd never forget.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.478
Well, I don't do that anymore.

34:39.511 --> 34:43.215
-You still gonna shoot me?
-I'm the only person who can.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.784
You're a very special beauty.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.819
Very specific.

34:53.425 --> 34:57.028
Mm. Ain't nothing free.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.833
What you want me
to do in return?

35:01.867 --> 35:03.669
A private sitting.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.272
Some shots
for my personal collection.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.274
I'll do it as a trade.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.309
Won't cost you a dime.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.813
Three, two, one.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.748
Beautiful.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.517
*

35:22.521 --> 35:24.156
Good, good, good, good.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.825
Keep going. Hands up, hands up.

35:29.695 --> 35:30.996
You are beautiful.

35:31.029 --> 35:33.365
* Walking like a man,
hitting like a hammer *

35:33.399 --> 35:36.268
* She's a juvenile scam,
never was a quitter *

35:36.302 --> 35:39.805
* Tasty like a raindrop,
she's got the look *

35:41.873 --> 35:44.276
-* Heavenly bound,
'cause heaven's got a number *
-Chin down.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.545
* When she's spinning me around,
kissing is a color *

35:46.578 --> 35:50.616
* Her loving is a wild dog,
she's got the look *

35:50.649 --> 35:52.684
* She's got the look,
she's got the look *

35:52.718 --> 35:55.887
* She's got the look, she's got
the look *

35:55.921 --> 35:58.524
* What in the world can make
a brown-eyed girl turn blue? *

35:58.557 --> 36:00.559
Yes.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.894
* When everything I'll ever do *

36:02.928 --> 36:05.631
-* I'll do for you *
-Beautiful.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.634
* And I go la, la, la, la, la *

36:08.667 --> 36:10.902
* She's got the look... *

36:10.936 --> 36:12.037
Yes, towards me.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.139
Towards me, move them.
Yes. Three, two, one.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.674
Yes, beautiful, beautiful.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.676
One more, just like that.
Just like that.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.678
Three, two, one.
Yes, yes.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.113
Perfect, perfect...

36:23.181 --> 36:25.317
What do you want?

36:25.351 --> 36:27.553
Take that off.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.764
(exhales)

36:58.584 --> 37:00.586
(camera shutter clicks)

37:02.654 --> 37:05.491
And that.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.628
N-No.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.663
Yeah.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.479
Touch it.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.421
(cheering, applause)

37:35.454 --> 37:39.124
The category is Runway.

37:39.157 --> 37:43.329
Bring it
like a French Revolution.

37:43.362 --> 37:47.499
Poverty and abundance
personified,

37:47.533 --> 37:49.835
and a goddamn category I like.

37:49.868 --> 37:53.138
We have much to fight back
against, children.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.477
And what have we here?

37:58.510 --> 38:01.480
Miss Candy and Miss Lulu

38:01.513 --> 38:03.415
serving up Les Misérables

38:03.449 --> 38:07.419
peasant slut realness.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.821
You got some ghetto proppage.

38:09.855 --> 38:13.692
Piece of French baguette
and a pitchfork?

38:13.725 --> 38:15.661
What is this, Hee Haw?

38:15.694 --> 38:19.365
You got enough to feed
the multitudes, baby,

38:19.398 --> 38:22.934
with your five fish and three
loaves of bread. (laughs)

38:22.968 --> 38:25.537
We got a horse mouth
up there, though. Here.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.305
(laughter, booing)

38:28.707 --> 38:30.509
Judges, your scores.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.344
Seven, seven,

38:32.378 --> 38:34.713
-six, eight, seven.
-(gasps, laughs)

38:34.746 --> 38:36.014
House of Ferocity...

38:36.047 --> 38:38.016
* Ain't so ferocious *

38:38.049 --> 38:40.318
* Ain't so ferocious. *

38:40.352 --> 38:42.554
See you later, my darlings.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.456
Always.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.492
I mean, you think she would
learn by now, right?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.527
Who's next?

38:48.560 --> 38:50.328
Who's gonna be next up in here?

38:50.362 --> 38:53.298
(cheering, screaming)

38:53.331 --> 38:55.333
(fanfare playing)

38:57.168 --> 38:59.638
Yes, okay. Uh-huh.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.740
Here comes Miss Elektra...

39:03.875 --> 39:05.877
...serving us Marie Antoinette.

39:05.911 --> 39:08.046
How apropos,

39:08.079 --> 39:10.516
a queen who cares nothing
for her kingdom.

39:10.549 --> 39:13.151
Oh...

39:13.184 --> 39:16.655
Yes, and the children
are serving us narrative.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.591
It's early morning
in Versailles,

39:19.625 --> 39:22.528
and Queen Marie
is being serviced

39:22.561 --> 39:25.263
by her dutiful young men.

39:25.296 --> 39:28.333
Let them eat cake.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.869
Ah, the carousel twirls,

39:30.902 --> 39:33.405
the carousel twirls.

39:33.439 --> 39:36.908
Remember when things
were simpler, Elektra?

39:36.942 --> 39:39.344
Before our young men
were dropping dead

39:39.377 --> 39:42.648
before our very eyes.

39:44.583 --> 39:48.119
And they're still going.
There's even more story.

39:49.955 --> 39:53.892
Y'all created a guillotine
for this mess?

39:53.925 --> 39:55.260
(crowd screaming)

39:55.293 --> 39:56.762
For real?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.073
Mm.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.108
(cheering, applause)

40:12.444 --> 40:14.680
Bravo, bravo.

40:17.516 --> 40:21.052
I must admit,
that was very well done.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.822
So tell me something.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.457
How long did you rehearse that?

40:25.491 --> 40:27.493
Is that where you were

40:27.526 --> 40:30.161
instead of showing up
for your dying community?

40:30.195 --> 40:31.463
(gasping, shouting)

40:31.497 --> 40:34.733
Way to set an example
for the kids, Elektra.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.335
What's your problem, Pray Tell?

40:37.368 --> 40:40.305
Get off your soapbox and ask
the judges for their scores.

40:40.338 --> 40:43.141
Oh, I don't need to ask
the judges for scores.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.810
I know what they are,
and everybody in this room

40:44.843 --> 40:46.845
knows what they are.

40:46.878 --> 40:50.582
Miss Elektra Abundance
Evangelista,

40:50.616 --> 40:52.183
grand prize,

40:52.217 --> 40:55.487
this week and last week

40:55.521 --> 40:56.922
and the week before that

40:56.955 --> 40:59.257
and the week before that
and the week

40:59.290 --> 41:01.292
before that, granny!

41:02.728 --> 41:04.362
Here, here.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.270
-Take your trophy.
-(gasping)

41:12.303 --> 41:14.673
Bitch, you better get me
a new trophy

41:14.706 --> 41:18.043
and then come down here
so I can shove it up your ass.

41:18.076 --> 41:21.513
(oohing)

41:23.481 --> 41:26.184
I'm gonna lay it out for you.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.186
One time

41:28.219 --> 41:31.723
your community needed you

41:31.757 --> 41:33.625
at that protest,

41:33.659 --> 41:35.460
and you didn't show up.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.329
-(indistinct chatter)
-ATTENDEE: That's right.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.235
-I was working.
-PRAY TELL: Yeah.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.471
-You work the night shift.
-(crowd oohing)

41:46.504 --> 41:49.741
The protest was in the morning.
Don't give me that bullshit.

41:49.775 --> 41:51.376
So, what did I miss?

41:51.409 --> 41:54.045
A bunch of fags holding hands,
screaming into the wind?

41:54.079 --> 41:55.714
ATTENDEE 2:
Shame!

42:00.518 --> 42:03.488
I went to jail.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.725
111 people

42:06.758 --> 42:08.727
went to jail.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.997
You are more concerned
about winning a trophy

42:12.030 --> 42:13.999
than you are
about our government

42:14.032 --> 42:18.269
spreading lies about us
in an effort to kill us!

42:18.303 --> 42:20.438
And you want to know
why they want us dead?

42:20.471 --> 42:23.942
Because we're black and
we're brown and we're queer.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.877
They don't give a shit about us,

42:25.911 --> 42:29.247
so we better start
caring about ourselves.

42:29.280 --> 42:33.284
Show up for your lives!
Wake up!

42:43.261 --> 42:46.732
Jack, where are you?
Come on up here

42:46.765 --> 42:48.066
and call out
the rest of these categories

42:48.099 --> 42:49.801
before the back of my head
blows off.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.770
-(crowd oohing)
-I got to go home.

42:51.803 --> 42:55.106
(cheering, applause)

42:55.140 --> 42:57.375
Wake the fuck up.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.810
ATTENDEE 3:
That's right.

43:06.852 --> 43:09.454
* Back to life,
back to reality... *

43:09.487 --> 43:11.322
MIZRAHI:
The category is...

43:11.356 --> 43:14.392
(rolling R):
Runway.

43:14.425 --> 43:18.063
Bring it like the booked
black beauties in Vogue.

43:18.096 --> 43:22.600
You ain't never gonna hit no
real runway, we all know that.

43:22.634 --> 43:26.905
But you can serve
a look so flawless

43:26.938 --> 43:30.508
that you fool us like
little Miss Grace Jones-ish

43:30.541 --> 43:33.745
is doing right here, baby.

43:33.779 --> 43:37.282
She's over here serving you
trash bag realness, darlings.

43:37.315 --> 43:38.817
Sponsored by Glad.

43:38.850 --> 43:41.019
Hefty, hefty, hefty.

43:41.052 --> 43:42.988
Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.

43:43.021 --> 43:46.624
She came to take
all the garbage out tonight.

43:46.658 --> 43:49.094
Now who do we have here?

43:49.127 --> 43:50.662
(cheering, applause)

43:50.696 --> 43:54.532
Yes, Miss Pat Cleveland, I see.

43:56.567 --> 43:57.869
Oh, she's twirling
and a-trotting

43:57.903 --> 43:59.270
like no other for you.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.707
Goddess! Athena!

44:01.740 --> 44:04.642
Aphrodite! Minerva!

44:04.676 --> 44:06.477
Okay, anybody else walking?

44:06.511 --> 44:07.946
I see commotion back there.

44:07.979 --> 44:10.115
Okay, I see it.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.217
(cheering)

44:12.250 --> 44:14.619
Remember when I said ethereal?

44:14.652 --> 44:16.021
Otherworldly?

44:16.054 --> 44:20.826
Miss Angel, you are giving
just that, baby.

44:23.929 --> 44:26.064
Her homage to
It girl Veronica Webb.

44:26.097 --> 44:29.134
Oh, please, she is
truly unmatched.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.970
This is how you do it.

44:32.003 --> 44:35.673
That is a model.
That is a cover girl.

44:35.707 --> 44:37.542
Now, judges,

44:37.575 --> 44:40.645
our girls are serving a fantasy,

44:40.678 --> 44:43.815
one that requires you
to suspend disbelief

44:43.849 --> 44:46.517
and imagine them
on the real runway,

44:46.551 --> 44:48.053
in actual print.

44:48.086 --> 44:50.989
Would they stack up
on the newsstands?

44:51.022 --> 44:53.491
Scores for Miss Grace Jones

44:53.524 --> 44:55.927
and her glistening cocoa skin?

44:55.961 --> 44:59.497
Ten, ten, nine, nine, ten.

44:59.530 --> 45:02.333
Well done.
And Miss Pat Cleveland

45:02.367 --> 45:04.870
and her flight of fancy? Ten,

45:04.903 --> 45:07.372
nine, nine, ten,

45:07.405 --> 45:10.108
ten. And what about

45:10.141 --> 45:13.078
Miss Angel Evangelista?

45:13.111 --> 45:14.379
(cheering)

45:14.412 --> 45:17.548
* Tens across the board. *

45:17.582 --> 45:19.084
Come and collect, girl!

45:19.117 --> 45:21.219
This is what I am talking about.

45:21.252 --> 45:24.522
On the way to legendary,
a feared name in ballroom.

45:24.555 --> 45:28.860
Structure, beautiful,
poised, attitude.

45:28.894 --> 45:31.562
She has the makings
of a star girl,

45:31.596 --> 45:33.031
a cover girl!

45:33.064 --> 45:34.933
(cheering)

45:46.411 --> 45:48.179
(crying)

46:00.959 --> 46:02.327
What's going on, mama?

46:02.360 --> 46:05.730
You're supposed
to be celebrating.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.232
You the queen of that
model category.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.267
Yeah, in there.

46:11.202 --> 46:14.639
I want a victory outside
of the ballroom, Papi.

46:16.707 --> 46:19.677
(crying):
I'm never gonna be a real model.

46:19.710 --> 46:21.813
That may be true
for them girls in there,

46:21.847 --> 46:24.883
but that is not
your destiny, Angel.

46:27.352 --> 46:29.654
I got to tell y'all something.

46:29.687 --> 46:31.689
What's up?

46:36.294 --> 46:37.996
Please, y-you have to promise

46:38.029 --> 46:40.131
you're not gonna
be disappointed.

46:40.165 --> 46:41.332
Never.

46:47.138 --> 46:49.340
That photographer clocked me.

46:52.043 --> 46:55.146
He recognized me from the piers.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.950
And, look, I didn't
have enough money

46:58.984 --> 47:01.186
to pay for the photo shoot.

47:03.388 --> 47:05.823
So he...

47:05.857 --> 47:09.394
-so he took
dirty pictures of me.
-What?

47:09.427 --> 47:12.730
He took pictures
of everything, Papi.

47:12.763 --> 47:14.665
He saw everything.

47:15.867 --> 47:18.904
What if he sells them
to some-some porno magazine?

47:18.937 --> 47:21.206
And then I'm branded as a dirty

47:21.239 --> 47:24.309
transsexual hooker
for the rest of my life.

47:24.342 --> 47:27.745
-Mama, the whole world
will know.
-Nah. Nah.

47:27.778 --> 47:29.314
-The whole world.
-Nah, this is not happening

47:29.347 --> 47:31.983
on my watch.
Do you hear me?

47:32.017 --> 47:34.719
With what I got planned? With
what you deserve in this world?

47:34.752 --> 47:37.989
Hell no.
Hell no.

47:38.023 --> 47:40.725
We getting what's yours.
What's his address?

47:40.758 --> 47:43.828
Where the fucking
pictures at, huh?!

47:43.861 --> 47:47.265
Give Angel her fucking pictures.

47:47.298 --> 47:50.001
I want my photos!
Where are they?

47:50.035 --> 47:52.870
-They're over there.
-Be more specific. Point!

47:52.904 --> 47:54.372
On the corner of the desk.

48:00.745 --> 48:03.448
Angel, baby, you are stunning.

48:03.481 --> 48:07.285
-Really?
-Yeah. Where the negatives?

48:07.318 --> 48:09.988
They're locked in the bottom
cabinet. The key is on the desk.

48:15.826 --> 48:18.496
-ANGEL: Come on, come on...
-Y'all good over there?

48:21.766 --> 48:23.768
These all of them?

48:32.343 --> 48:36.081
If you ever try exploiting
my daughter again,

48:36.114 --> 48:38.416
I'm not coming with
my son's fists the next time.

48:38.449 --> 48:41.752
Yeah, you hear that,
you punk-ass bitch?

48:56.634 --> 48:59.470
You don't know what it took
for me to get here, Ms. Ford.

49:05.710 --> 49:07.712
I want a shot.

49:12.050 --> 49:15.853
A real... shot.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.068
Hmm.

49:36.174 --> 49:39.577
Absolutely beautiful.

50:01.166 --> 50:03.168
(scrubbing continuing)

50:18.749 --> 50:22.220
-Ain't no dirt on that floor.
-(laughs)

50:24.289 --> 50:25.556
You need a new job, Mother.

50:25.590 --> 50:27.592
You don't do well with
too much time on your hands.

50:27.625 --> 50:28.859
In a few days,
you'll have scrubbed

50:28.893 --> 50:30.095
the paint off all the walls

50:30.128 --> 50:32.897
and forced Lil Papi
to run for mayor or some shit.

50:32.930 --> 50:35.333
(sighs)

50:35.366 --> 50:37.702
Maybe I'm going a little crazy.

50:37.735 --> 50:39.404
Quitting a good job
and thinking I could create

50:39.437 --> 50:42.207
some kind of immortality to...

50:42.240 --> 50:46.444
(sighs) see through my house
and my... my children.

50:49.614 --> 50:51.282
Maybe it's better to dream small

50:51.316 --> 50:54.119
or not dream at all.

50:54.152 --> 50:55.786
At least then

50:55.820 --> 50:58.456
you can die with some dignity
still intact.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.491
(chuckles)

51:02.927 --> 51:04.929
I'm sorry, I'm...

51:04.962 --> 51:08.899
(sighs)

51:08.933 --> 51:12.137
My T cell count is low,
and I'm feeling morbid.

51:12.170 --> 51:14.939
How low?

51:17.942 --> 51:20.945
Well, not low enough to stop
scrubbing these damn floors.

51:40.131 --> 51:42.133
Mama.

51:55.613 --> 51:58.483
(sighs)

52:08.226 --> 52:10.828
-I made top ten.
-What?

52:10.861 --> 52:12.830
Angel...

52:12.863 --> 52:14.632
Angel, are you serious?

52:15.966 --> 52:17.101
Yes.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.970
(laughing):
What?

52:20.004 --> 52:21.506
Oh, my...

52:23.241 --> 52:27.945
Well, Miss Angel, you better get
ready for the ride of your life.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.780
(chuckles)

52:29.814 --> 52:31.449
I'm ready.

52:31.482 --> 52:35.220
Hear, hear!
To Miss Angel Evangelista

52:35.253 --> 52:38.223
purring down every catwalk.

52:38.256 --> 52:39.290
(mouths)

52:39.324 --> 52:41.025
From New York to Paris

52:41.058 --> 52:44.061
to Milan.

52:44.094 --> 52:45.230
-Meow.
-To Angel.

52:45.263 --> 52:46.597
ALL:
To Angel!

52:49.166 --> 52:50.701
And, and....

52:50.735 --> 52:54.205
-to Miss Blanca Evangelista...
-Me?

52:54.239 --> 52:57.074
...the mother
who made it all happen.

52:57.107 --> 53:01.011
She seems to see the future

53:01.045 --> 53:04.014
better than any fortune teller
that I've ever been to.

53:04.048 --> 53:05.816
-Come on, Mother.
-(chuckles)

53:05.850 --> 53:06.984
ANGEL:
You know it.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.419
How-some-ever...

53:08.453 --> 53:10.521
(overlapping chatter)

53:10.555 --> 53:13.157
...I still ain't gonna let
Sue Simmons up into my balls

53:13.190 --> 53:16.193
to ruin all of our lives
with her tabloid news stories.

53:16.227 --> 53:17.895
-Oh, boy.
-Okay?

53:17.928 --> 53:20.731
-LIL PAPI: He said that's it.
-To Mother Blanca Evangelista!

53:20.765 --> 53:23.100
-ALL: To Blanca!
-Mother Blanca!

53:24.469 --> 53:28.239
All right, well, listen,
I love you, too, Pray,

53:28.273 --> 53:31.008
but I'm not giving up
on letting them reporters in

53:31.041 --> 53:34.612
to seeing how amazing
and magical our community is.

53:34.645 --> 53:37.282
And you know that I am
as stubborn as an old drag queen

53:37.315 --> 53:40.518
with a 5:00 shadow
at 3:00 in the "morn-ting."

53:40.551 --> 53:41.619
(laughter)

53:41.652 --> 53:43.254
-Okay?
-Okay, fine.

53:43.288 --> 53:46.223
So good luck with that, bitch.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.859
Look at what the cat dragged in.

53:48.893 --> 53:52.430
Somebody please hospitalize me
so I can have a decent meal.

53:52.463 --> 53:55.232
What? Excuse me? You know
that Friday night dinner

53:55.266 --> 53:56.867
starts at 8:00 p.m. sharp,

53:56.901 --> 53:58.869
and you didn't even
set the table this week.

53:58.903 --> 54:02.540
How much effort does it take
to throw down some paper plates?

54:02.573 --> 54:04.575
Why is it so hard
for you to be nice?

54:04.609 --> 54:07.278
Like, why can't you say,
"I'm sorry" or "I was late"

54:07.312 --> 54:08.446
or "I made a mistake"?

54:08.479 --> 54:09.780
You want to talk
about being nice?

54:09.814 --> 54:13.150
I recall that it was just
last weekend when Pray Tell

54:13.183 --> 54:15.986
disrespected me in front
of all my peers at the ball.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.988
Ain't nobody disrespect you.

54:18.022 --> 54:21.892
I called your black selfish ass
out for being a bad example,

54:21.926 --> 54:24.295
and it's about time
somebody did.

54:24.329 --> 54:26.497
And this is not about your
stank-ass attitude, Elektra,

54:26.531 --> 54:29.166
this is about you showing up
to be a part of the house.

54:29.199 --> 54:31.569
And you didn't pay your share
of the rent this month.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.471
Neither did any of these
little bottom feeders!

54:33.504 --> 54:35.172
Elektra, they ain't got
no money.

54:35.205 --> 54:37.241
But you, with all these
new furs and jewelry,

54:37.274 --> 54:39.410
strutting around, but you must
be getting plenty of money

54:39.444 --> 54:40.645
from somewhere.
Where is you getting

54:40.678 --> 54:42.313
all this money from,
Queen of the Nile?

54:42.347 --> 54:45.182
Where is you getting
all this finery?

54:47.284 --> 54:50.321
I don't owe you an explanation
for anything.

54:50.355 --> 54:51.756
I've had enough of this abuse.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.858
Just because I was down
on my luck for a moment

54:53.891 --> 54:55.993
does not mean I'll spend
the rest of my life

54:56.026 --> 54:57.462
living like some
indentured servant.

54:57.495 --> 55:01.666
I am not a slum rat
like the rest of you whores!

55:01.699 --> 55:03.968
I don't owe you any answers,

55:04.001 --> 55:05.703
I don't owe you any manners,

55:05.736 --> 55:07.805
and I most certainly don't
owe you a goddamn apology

55:07.838 --> 55:09.474
for being late to a 99-cent meal

55:09.507 --> 55:11.576
made from canned meat
and prison-grade toilet wine!

55:16.481 --> 55:17.815
-Guess what.
-You don't have to

55:17.848 --> 55:20.385
tell me I'm out of the house.
I quit, bitch!

55:20.418 --> 55:23.488
And you best not ever show your
face in the ballrooms again.

55:23.521 --> 55:25.356
I'm going to eat you alive
on that runway.

55:25.390 --> 55:28.759
Of that you can be sure!

55:32.763 --> 55:34.231
("Vogue" by Madonna playing)

55:34.264 --> 55:36.000
(door slams)

55:38.569 --> 55:40.771
-Can I have her bed?
-(sighs)

55:55.219 --> 55:56.454
(doorbell rings)

56:00.190 --> 56:03.394
I'm joining your house.
You're welcome, bitches.

56:04.629 --> 56:06.531
How's everybody feeling tonight?

56:06.564 --> 56:08.065
(cheering)

56:08.098 --> 56:09.266
PRAY TELL:
All right, all right.

56:09.299 --> 56:11.101
So, listen, I just want
to take a moment

56:11.135 --> 56:14.472
to acknowledge one of the
pioneers of the ballroom.

56:17.642 --> 56:23.080
In 1970, Pop, Spin, Dip

56:23.113 --> 56:24.515
was introduced

56:24.549 --> 56:27.418
right here
on the ballroom floor.

56:27.452 --> 56:29.019
Now, as legend would have it,

56:29.053 --> 56:32.790
Paris Dupree was flipping
through a Vogue magazine

56:32.823 --> 56:36.594
and saw the poses
that the models were doing.

56:36.627 --> 56:38.596
She brought it right back here
to the ballroom floor,

56:38.629 --> 56:42.032
imitating the models
to the beat.

56:42.066 --> 56:46.904
This is the category
as we know it today.

56:46.937 --> 56:48.939
Know your history, children.

56:48.973 --> 56:52.743
Now, let's Vogue like Paris!

56:54.278 --> 56:56.447
* Come on, Vogue *

56:57.948 --> 57:01.285
* Let your body move
to the music *

57:01.318 --> 57:03.454
-* Move to the music *
-* Hey, hey, hey *

57:03.488 --> 57:04.655
* Come on, Vogue *

57:06.791 --> 57:09.326
* Let your body go
with the flow *

57:09.359 --> 57:12.563
-* Go with the flow *
-* You know you can do it *

57:12.597 --> 57:15.165
* Beauty's where you find it *

57:15.199 --> 57:19.436
* Not just where you
bump and grind it *

57:19.470 --> 57:23.140
* Soul is in the music, oh *

57:23.173 --> 57:27.645
* That's where I feel
so beautiful *

57:27.678 --> 57:31.115
-* Magical, life's a ball *
-(shouts)

57:31.148 --> 57:33.851
* So get up on the dance floor *

57:33.884 --> 57:36.420
* Come on, Vogue... *

57:36.453 --> 57:37.822
(laughing)

57:37.855 --> 57:40.257
* Let your body move
to the music *

57:40.290 --> 57:42.259
-* Move to the music *
-* Hey, hey, hey... *

57:42.292 --> 57:44.795
I told you,
everything is changing.

57:44.829 --> 57:47.097
This is just the beginning.

57:47.131 --> 57:49.099
(cheering)

57:49.133 --> 57:53.037
* You know you can do it *

57:53.070 --> 57:55.072
* Vogue, Vogue, Vogue, Vogue. *

Ow!

I think they might,
actually.

Screw it. If we're dyin'

not to cycle fast,
but to cycle slow.

1:00:28.693 --> 1:00:30.060
It's just pure violence.

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:31.796

1:00:48.012 --> 1:00:49.146
there was a little boy.

-He had a gift.
-(muffled shouts)

1:00:51.015 --> 1:00:52.082
And a curse.

1:00:53.583 --> 1:00:55.720
-All his life
he's been tricked...
-(cackles)

1:00:55.753 --> 1:00:58.655
-his head filled
with the voices.
-(shouts)

1:00:58.689 --> 1:01:00.590
And he wore his madness
like a coat,

1:01:01.759 --> 1:01:03.828
because he saw
what he becomes.
