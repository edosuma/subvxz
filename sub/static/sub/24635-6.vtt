WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:07.439
Fucking hell, this is ridiculous!

00:07.440 --> 00:09.079
It was a joke kiss.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.719
We were pretending
to be husband and wife.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.319
I did not... It was nothing.
I didn't mean for it to linger.

00:14.320 --> 00:16.479
- Linger. Did you say linger?
- Linger? For how long?

00:16.480 --> 00:17.959
That's the wrong word. It didn't...

00:17.960 --> 00:20.079
- Five or six seconds, max.
- Six seconds?

00:20.080 --> 00:22.199
- One one thousand... 
- That's an eternity in kissing.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.719
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.319
We have much bigger things
to worry about.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.479
Like the fact that we're
gonna be homeless in a month.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.839
What? What are you talking about?

00:29.840 --> 00:32.399
Darling, darling,
you left this in the car.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.359
Um... I couldn't help but overhear...

00:35.360 --> 00:38.359
You do know that I am
a qualified couple's counsellor.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.439
Not qualified,
she has one more exam tomorrow.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.439
So who was kissing who, hm?

00:42.440 --> 00:46.399
Let me take a stab and say
it's my daughter with, ah, you.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.279
- Yeah.
- Ruben!

00:48.280 --> 00:50.999
So let's start with intimacy, OK?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.359
Sex lives.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.119
Um... where's it all at?

00:55.120 --> 00:57.120
Can everyone just... leave, please?

00:57.920 --> 01:00.319
Yeah, just... just go, Mum.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.000
- Not you.
- Oh...

01:04.440 --> 01:06.520
Bye. I'll call you tomorrow, Mum.

01:12.990 --> 01:17.990
- Synced and corrected by AlexandreMT -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:19.440 --> 01:21.639
Ideally, we'll find something cute
in the area

01:21.640 --> 01:23.039
and it won't be such a big deal.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.080
Really?

01:24.081 --> 01:25.399
I'm still grappling with the fact

01:25.400 --> 01:28.199
that you've offered for us to move out
that seems pretty crazy to me.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.679
How many times have I told you I did
not expect her to say yes, did I?

01:30.680 --> 01:32.479
It's her house!

01:32.480 --> 01:34.319
We've had a good run.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.959
I thought we wanted
to buy our own place.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.479
Yeah, when we'd saved a deposit,
not when we went down to one income.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.759
Yeah, I know, but she can't
afford two rents and the mortgage

01:40.760 --> 01:42.519
and we can't cover it all.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.119
She's in a mess.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.359
Verity is irresponsible with money, OK.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.239
Well, I don't hear you complaining
every time she buys you a new shirt.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.559
Well, that would be rude.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.399
It's not because she has excellent
taste in menswear? That is one!

01:53.400 --> 01:55.319
Alright, she doesn't have to go
to Venice to get it.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.919
Can we not do this again?

01:56.920 --> 01:59.679
I am sorry, I will fix it.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.559
I will go to this open house
and get an idea of what we...

02:02.560 --> 02:04.559
Oh, what about mother's group?

02:04.560 --> 02:07.999
I'm sure Ruben would be
really keen to see you.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.639
Yeah, I think our living situation

02:09.639 --> 02:11.279
is a bit more important
than that, Jeremy.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.520
- Watch out.
- Oh, well, there we go.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.280
Good morning.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.160
I hate gentrification.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.960
- Cortado?
- Yes, please.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.399
So, um, what are we talking?

02:34.400 --> 02:37.120
- Like, high sevens, eights?
- Two.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.759
- Two?
- Two, yep.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.279
- $2 million?
- Yeah.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.919
Well, fuck off.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.599
$2 million for the... ?
With these tiles?

02:46.600 --> 02:47.920
Yes.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.159
- Does that sit in your price range?
- Yep.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.839
Good, OK.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.319
Does it?

02:54.320 --> 02:55.520
No.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.879
Ooh...

02:57.880 --> 02:59.279
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.919
I'm just gonna, um...

03:00.920 --> 03:03.239
I'm going to check
the orientation of the bathroom.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.719
- North-east.
- Yes, is it?

03:04.720 --> 03:06.120
- Yeah. Mm-hm.
- Good.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.720
Excuse me. Thanks. Yep.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.920
Oh, impeccable timing.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.640
Ooh, yes.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.000
Oh.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.960
Eww.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.239
Are you gonna be long?

03:34.240 --> 03:36.160
Ah, sorry, I won't be a sec.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.879
Can you tell me
the dimensions approximately?

03:39.880 --> 03:44.679
Um, yeah, it's about
two by three, I'd say.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.319
The vanity... is it
engineered stone or... ?

03:47.320 --> 03:49.439
No, it's like a fake granite.

03:49.440 --> 03:53.080
Um, ah, like a fancy laminate,
think early '90s.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.159
Is there a shower and a bath
or just a bath?

03:58.160 --> 04:00.559
Just a... No, it's a bath, um...

04:00.560 --> 04:02.759
It's a bath with jets.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.120
- Ooh, like a spa bath?
- Yes, yes.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.920
OK.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.039
Miss, you need to open the door.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.959
Yeah, OK, I'm just
changing a nappy, alright?

04:14.960 --> 04:16.839
Won't be a sec, sorry.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:26.000 --> 04:28.719
Well, final week. You made it.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.359
Here's to you all and to Audrey,
wherever she is.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.720
Cheers.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.199
I can't believe this is over.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.999
We've all changed so much.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.759
I mean look at me,
I'm drinking out of a paper cup.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.479
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need those back too.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.079
They're for Neil's 40th on Sunday.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.119
Alright, 20 words - or less -
one thing you've all learned.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.959
How much you can achieve
on such little sleep.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.079
Head lice can definitely survive on
bedsheets for longer than 24 hours.

04:55.080 --> 04:59.159
Yeah, and FYI, ladies,
bald babies can catch them too.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.759
Um, that career and money
aren't everything.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.639
- Big shift on that one.
- Yeah, you're right.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.719
Career and money aren't...

05:06.720 --> 05:08.599
Well, hang on...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.759
I need my career
so I can earn us some money.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.959
- Oh.
- Georgia?

05:12.960 --> 05:15.479
Well, no surprise, really, to learn

05:15.480 --> 05:18.239
just how fucking sexist and
misogynistic the world still is

05:18.240 --> 05:20.959
and how appalling it is that
I can still be body-shamed

05:20.960 --> 05:22.599
for feeding my baby.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.519
- What?
- What? You?

05:24.520 --> 05:27.679
Yeah. I got kicked out of a cafe
for breastfeeding.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.239
- Oh, stop it.
- No way!

05:29.240 --> 05:31.039
- That is crazy.
- Why is that still happening?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.759
That is outr... That... I'm sorry...

05:32.760 --> 05:34.679
... that really gets me.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.199
No, really,
how is this still happening?

05:37.200 --> 05:39.199
There are legal protections
in place for this.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.359
Yeah, I had to draft a lactation
accommodation policy at my work.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.599
Mainly for me. It was very tedious.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.639
Georgia, which cafe was it?
Please don't say Petty Cash Cafe.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.799
- It was Petty Cash.
- Oh, shit.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.159
That is shit that you were kicked out

05:55.160 --> 05:59.599
and not that it is... 
was our favourite cafe.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.599
Well, there is one thing you lot can do.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.919
Nurse-in!

06:02.920 --> 06:04.959
No, I was thinking of writing a letter.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.599
- I'm in, actually.
- Of course you are.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.599
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, me too. That sounds fun.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.760
Let's do it.

06:09.761 --> 06:11.759
Nah, I think breastfeeding
in public's gross.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.119
- What?
- Why?

06:13.120 --> 06:16.119
I am joking, of course I'll come,
I was just trying to get out of it.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.440
- Oh, I'm weaning, is that an excuse?
- No.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.280
Jeremy?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.640
Anything you wanna tell me?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.199
No.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.520
No? Nothing in California?

06:46.720 --> 06:48.440
Just how did you...

06:49.920 --> 06:51.599
Don't get mad.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.359
I was gonna tell you as soon
as I had all the paperwork

06:54.360 --> 06:57.319
and all the finer details,
then I was gonna let you...

06:57.320 --> 06:59.119
I can give you them
right now, if you like.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.159
Um, "Danish '60s teak,
D-shape legs, well proportioned.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.319
"Excellent condition", apparently,
and it's in Palo Alto.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.839
You've got a serious problem, pal.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.240
This is the last thing
we should be spending money on.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.680
Hang on, paperwork? What?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.440
I've been offered a new job.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.919
They're developing a new prototype
for the electric car.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.399
Why didn't you tell me that?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.760
Because it's in California.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.840
You're kidding me.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.599
We can't go to America.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.279
For one, I am not flying long-haul
until she's two and I can drug her,

07:36.280 --> 07:38.519
and for two, what about Trump?

07:38.520 --> 07:41.599
- California's quite progressive.
- Oh, right.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.479
There's even a movement to secede,
it is called Calexit.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.680
- Is it?
- Yes.

07:45.681 --> 07:47.279
Yeah, well, I'll secede from you
in a minute.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.319
- And you know what I'll call that?
- What will you call that?

07:49.320 --> 07:51.559
Jeremy exit. J... Jegzit.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.199
Jerk Exit. Jegzit.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.959
Yeah, good one, Aud.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.799
Are you just gonna make a unilateral
decision on this, are you?

07:57.800 --> 08:01.159
Kind of like the one you made with
Verity when you gave back our house?

08:01.160 --> 08:03.279
- <i>Her</i> house?
- Yes.

08:03.280 --> 08:07.639
Look, I haven't accepted the job
but I would be stupid not to.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.199
14 people have been retrenched
this last month.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.039
What? Why haven't you told me that?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.199
Because there's this thing,
I don't want you to worry.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.439
Well, now I'm more worried because
you kept the initial worry from me.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.279
Oh, so with that logic maybe
I should be a little bit more concerned

08:21.280 --> 08:22.759
about what goes on
between you and Ruben?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.239
Oh, come on. That's...

08:24.240 --> 08:26.519
Look, I think this job offer
has come at the best time.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.719
You and I have talked about
we want to go and move overseas,

08:29.720 --> 08:31.759
these guys will pay start-up costs.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.719
Aud, this is my job
and it's taking us...

08:33.720 --> 08:35.239
What about my job? My career?

08:35.240 --> 08:37.839
I just don't work for a few years.
Is that it?

08:37.840 --> 08:40.639
'Cause I'm really excelling
at this stay-at-home mum thing.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.359
-  You <i>are</i> excelling.
- I am not.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.759
- Yes, you are!
- I'm not!

08:43.760 --> 08:46.039
Last night's carbonara
was made with breast milk.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.040
So what?

08:47.041 --> 08:48.759
Because I couldn't be fucked
going to the shops.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.297
Yeah, that's good, isn't it?
I have never washed

08:50.298 --> 08:53.399
any of my maternity bras and
how old is she now? That's months.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.440
Well, sometimes...

08:54.441 --> 08:56.999
I tell people she's teething when
I can't work out how to settle her,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.599
- which is a lot of the time... 
- OK, I get it.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.240
- I get that stuff.
- So you can't just...

09:01.200 --> 09:03.279
First the baptism and now this.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.079
And I know you finished
Chef's Table without me.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.919
- They're stand-alone episodes.
- What is happening to us?

09:08.920 --> 09:11.559
This is supposed to be... 
the happy time.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.599
People talk about this is like
the best time.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.720
Liars.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.079
I'm just trying to look after you, OK?

09:16.080 --> 09:17.680
Yeah, well, I am a fucking grown-up.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.360
I'm going to cool down.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.199
Literally, I'm gonna go to the pool.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.280
Um, she's napping, so you... 
Ah, you'll work it out.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.240
Hello, stranger.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.120
We get to say goodbye after all.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.159
I get irritated at the smallest things.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.559
Like... people exercising or...

10:07.560 --> 10:10.239
... Jeremy's loud breathing.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.239
I don't want to be a cranky mum.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.280
Of course you don't wanna be
a cranky mum, it's normal.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.160
Maybe I'm too selfish
to be any good at this.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.080
You know, last weekend
I went away without her and, um...

10:25.240 --> 10:26.960
... it was a relief.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.000
I quite enjoyed scrubbing floors
and fighting with Mum.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.240
It's normal.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.799
True.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.480
What if I can't always put her first?

10:40.680 --> 10:44.320
You need to let go
of how you thought it would be.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.080
I don't really feel like me.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.959
Well, it's normal. I mean,
Ester said something this week.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.559
She said she'd realised
that you are still you

11:00.560 --> 11:02.519
as well as being a mum.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.279
Even though you're a mum,
you're still you and it's true.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.959
Yep.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.439
I get... Well, she... you know...

11:08.440 --> 11:11.119
... she's smart, she's quite smart.
She is a bit annoying. But she's...

11:11.120 --> 11:12.640
- Very annoying.
- Yeah.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.000
But clever. Yeah.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.439
If you keep looking back,

11:20.440 --> 11:24.360
the only thing you'll think about
is what you've lost.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.279
How are things going with, ah,
what's his name? Jeremy, is it?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.199
Yeah. Um...

11:31.200 --> 11:34.080
- Right now we're not at our best.
- Mm.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.279
You know when babies cry
and we give them a little squeeze,

11:40.280 --> 11:42.359
it doesn't matter how irrational it is,

11:42.360 --> 11:44.959
we just try to understand them

11:44.960 --> 11:46.799
and make them feel safe.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.959
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

11:48.960 --> 11:53.080
Imagine if we could do that for
ourselves, or for any other adults.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.120
We're all just big babies, really.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.759
How many did you have?

12:00.760 --> 12:04.480
I carried one to term
and then I lost him.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.120
Oh, wow. I am...

12:10.960 --> 12:12.559
- ... I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.279
- And here I am just complaining... 
- Don't be.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.439
- Sorry.
- Don't be, it's normal.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.480
I get to work with babies every day.

12:21.520 --> 12:26.319
This is what mother's group
was for - having a good chat.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.799
You stay in touch with the girls...

12:28.800 --> 12:30.360
... and Ruben.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.959
They're an interesting bunch.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.040
Yep.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.279
We should get changed,
your lips are blue.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.079
- Ooh, thank you for noticing.
- Yeah, sorry.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.800
- It's alright. You good?
- Yeah.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.360
Good, 'cause I'm freezing.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.839
When's she gonna start sleeping
in a cot like a normal baby?

13:04.840 --> 13:07.159
Not that I am complaining,
these pick-ups are great.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.799
You look nice. Is that lipstick?

13:09.800 --> 13:12.559
- And eye-liner.
- Wow, God I miss make-up.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.159
You never wore make-up.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.559
Yeah, well, I miss making
the conscious choice to not wear it.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.039
Hey, can you swing by the park?

13:18.040 --> 13:19.799
I want to see your old mate
with the bum bag.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.599
- Big night? Hot date?
- Actually, I'm seeing Bob again.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.720
What?

13:23.721 --> 13:25.319
Yeah, we've been back on
for about a month.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.480
That's... Oh, that's good.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.679
What are you doing tonight?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.360
- Oh, just this.
- Oh, OK.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.840
I almost forgot, I've got news.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.559
We might be moving.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.759
Jeremy's just been offered a job
in California.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.679
Holy shit. Awesome.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.199
- Is it?
- Yeah.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.239
- Won't you miss me?
- Miss you, no.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.159
I'll be on the first
cheap flight to visit,

13:53.160 --> 13:54.879
we'll probably see more of each other.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.959
I can't remember the last time
I was in California.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.559
- Having a good night?
- Yeah.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.039
Who's going to California?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.199
I been there, it's awesome.
You'll love it, it's the best.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.599
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.599
- When?
- Ah, like '85. Mum won the lotto.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.279
She took me and my two half sisters
to Disneyland.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.319
And this is how you thank her? With
your life of drugs and petty crime.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.919
I didn't ask to go to Disneyland.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.799
Like, she could have invested
her money wisely,

14:15.800 --> 14:18.399
maybe she would have a house now
that she owns, but she doesn't.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.759
- Hey, can I PayPal?
- Yeah, totally, yeah, yeah.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.080
Why don't you deposit the money online,

14:22.120 --> 14:23.839
then put 'cocaine'
in the description bit,

14:23.840 --> 14:25.599
then I'll email you a receipt
for your records.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.119
Yeah, OK, I just thought
you might prefer

14:27.120 --> 14:28.679
not to carry all that
cash around in your...

14:28.680 --> 14:30.079
Well, he is carrying drugs, isn't he?

14:30.080 --> 14:32.319
So the cash is probably
the least of his worries.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.679
Let's do this.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.919
- What are you doing?
- Hey? This.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.399
- Get out of the car.
- No, no.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.879
- Get out!
- It will take two seconds.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.879
You are not doing that here.
You are not doing that here.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.479
- There is a minor there.
- Where?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.159
- Just there.
- Oh, my God, he's grown, hasn't he?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.999
Don't touch her. Get out.
Get out. Get out. Get out.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.679
- I'll just walk to Bob's.
- OK.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.119
- Bye, love.
- Bye.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.999
Hey, um, before you go,
what are you doing tomorrow?

14:51.000 --> 14:55.519
Some friends are staging a nurse-in.
Extra bodies would be good.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.879
Is that... That's a joke, right?

14:57.880 --> 14:59.999
Not really.
Don't worry... No, don't worry.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.679
- Um, miss you already.
- See ya.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.079
I'm free.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.360
- Not you.
- OK.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.919
When I say 'mother', you say 'sucker'.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.239
- Mother.
- Sucker.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.719
- Mother.
- Sucker.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.639
So how long does a nurse-in
go for, love? Just a ballpark?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.639
As long as it takes to
get our message through.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.559
- Another cupcake?
- Yeah, thank you.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.959
I don't know why I'm here.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.879
I've weaned and we're not making
much of an impact,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.319
the place is bloody heaving.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.719
- That's because you're on the ground.
- Get up, stand up, show some spirit!

15:27.720 --> 15:29.519
Alright.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.159
OK, Ruben, another chant.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.079
Start something
that will draw a crowd, yeah?

15:33.080 --> 15:35.479
OK, so breastfeeding's not working...

15:35.480 --> 15:39.039
What about the Westlink Motorway?
That really gets people riled up.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.799
No! Fuck motorways.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.119
OK, what about, um, safe schools.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.959
Trans rights,
that's really hot right now.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.559
Like bathrooms are for everyone,
trans rights are human rights.

15:48.560 --> 15:52.359
I thought this was a breastfeeding
rights things, not a trans thing.

15:52.360 --> 15:57.039
Well, it is, but you're dressed
for both, so, good on you, Dave.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.079
Thanks. What are you two wearing?

15:59.080 --> 16:01.600
- What is that?
- Breasts.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.319
Hey, there's Audrey. Audrey, hi.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.559
Hi!

16:06.560 --> 16:08.479
Audrey's here. Sorry.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.759
Here, Aud, have a cake
before Barb eats them all.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.519
- They're bloody nice.
- Maybe later.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.759
Hi, Audrey.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.879
- Nice to meet you... 
- See you again.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.199
You too.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.159
- Is that Breakfast News Tony?
- Ah, it is.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.799
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, he owes me.

16:21.800 --> 16:26.159
I accidentally leaked that council
memo on travel expenses last year.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.879
Thought it was my civic duty.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.719
- Do you wanna meet him?
- Damn right I do.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.240
- Here hold this.
- Come with me.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.280
- Georgia Lee. Thanks for coming.
- Is this the whole thing?

16:38.281 --> 16:40.279
I gave up a state government
sex scandal for this?

16:40.280 --> 16:42.799
Come on, you can build it.
Just do some long lens stuff.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.399
A bit of slow motion of the manager
behind the glass,

16:45.400 --> 16:47.399
ominous music, it'll be fine.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.920
Can we at least get some boobs out?

16:50.040 --> 16:51.120
Maybe...

16:52.480 --> 16:54.399
... her, blondie.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.119
Sorry. It is the number one
morning news show.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.759
We're number three,
it's been a tough year.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.279
Hey Soph, is Ziggy Junior
ready for a feed?

17:04.280 --> 17:06.759
Yes, sure.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.999
Great.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.079
Get in tight. Tight.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.358
Tits for tots!
Tits for tots!

17:15.359 --> 17:19.319
Tits for tots! Tits for tots!

17:19.319 --> 17:21.439
- Tits for tots!
- OK, got the chant.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.118
- I hate the word 'tits'.
- Oh, same.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.039
Hey, guys, I was thinking
of drawing up a social calendar

17:26.040 --> 17:28.879
now that our Ambrose time's up -
maybe rotate hosting.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.159
Oh, yeah...

17:30.160 --> 17:31.882
I'm not sure how long I'll be around.

17:31.883 --> 17:34.612
We might be moving for Jeremy's work.

17:34.613 --> 17:36.039
- What?
- Where to?

17:36.040 --> 17:38.959
Ah... America actually. California.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.599
- What?!
- America?!

17:40.600 --> 17:42.119
- Are you going?
- What's the job?

17:42.120 --> 17:45.719
Ah, electric car engineering stuff.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.759
Nup, sounds dumb.
He should get a real job here.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.359
Piece to camera. Let's go.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.920
OK, let's go.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.480
You're OK, we've been doing so well.
Yaaaaay!

18:09.680 --> 18:12.119
Our culture sexualises the breast,

18:12.120 --> 18:15.519
whether it's through porn
or plastic surgery or whatever.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.159
But what is the true purpose of breasts?

18:18.160 --> 18:20.239
To feed human babies.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.559
- Let's turn the cameras off, huh?
- Oh, here he is.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.199
This woman comes into our cafe daily

18:26.200 --> 18:30.360
and illegally downloads,
then binge-watches TV shows, OK?

18:31.440 --> 18:33.639
She sneaks in her own food.

18:33.640 --> 18:38.399
She... she drinks hot water
and she chews up all our data.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.320
That's why I asked her to leave.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.479
- I was breastfeeding.
- Breasts had nothing to do with it.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.719
If anything, it was the breasts
on screen that were the problem.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.039
Some subtitled thing.
Danish, I think.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.559
Hoax nursing, entitled millennial
falsely accuses local businessman.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.159
Don't you dare.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.839
You don't know what's it like looking

18:57.840 --> 18:59.307
after these precious little humans.

18:59.308 --> 19:01.599
The monotony and the boredom
and the cabin fever.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.119
Does something to your brain, OK?

19:04.120 --> 19:07.039
I mean, eventually our brains
get a lot bigger and more complex

19:07.040 --> 19:08.599
but there is a transition period.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.959
We need caffeine. We need cafes.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.919
We definitely need, you know,
to escape into quality Danish drama.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.720
And efficient broadband.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.399
Alright, but you owe me.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.999
OK.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.999
Let me get some overlay
for childhood obesity.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.680
- Who's got the fattest kid?
- None of... none of them.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.879
Actually, yours will do.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.439
What? She is not even in
the 70th percentile.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.239
It's fine. We stretch
the footage anyway.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.000
Alright. Just promise me
you'll blur her face.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.000
Sorry, Stevie.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.879
Hello, darling.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.839
Well, you didn't miss much.
It just fizzled out in the end.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.040
God, I'm hungry.

19:49.041 --> 19:51.079
Get the mushrooms. They're good.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.241
Hey, I just wanted to say I'm...

19:53.600 --> 19:55.439
I'm sorry I was so mean to you
all those years ago

19:55.440 --> 19:57.399
when you wouldn't give me a sibling.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.039
It's not that straightforward, is it?

20:00.040 --> 20:01.461
Were you?

20:02.240 --> 20:04.119
Yeah, remember when I went
to kick the puppy

20:04.120 --> 20:05.799
'cause I thought it was
a consolation prize?

20:05.800 --> 20:06.800
Awful.

20:06.801 --> 20:08.439
No, I've got no memory of that.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.599
Anyway, it was your father
who wanted only you.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.799
I wanted a whole tribe of you.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.239
You did not.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.359
Yes, I did. I would have gone for five.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.400
That way you would all
take care of each other.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.879
- Now, Aud, sex.
- Mm-hm?

20:24.880 --> 20:27.079
Looking for more clients, are you?

20:27.080 --> 20:29.520
You two need to make more time
for each other.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.040
Alright, go. I'm not paying you.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.079
How was the nurse-in?

20:45.080 --> 20:46.480
Ah, really good.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.359
Um, I'm just gonna put her down
and then I'm gonna go to bed.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.840
I think I need an early night.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.000
OK?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.240
Ooh, come on.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.799
- Aud?
- Shh.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.280
She's asleep. Finally.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.839
Oh.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.999
Whisky picnic?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.320
Whiskey picnic. Yes.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.319
Oh, wow.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.120
Out of practice.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.840
I wanted to say sorry
for not telling you about the job.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.320
OK.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.319
I'd just like to make
the odd decision that isn't...

21:42.320 --> 21:45.440
... a striped body suit
or whale print onesie, you know?

21:46.720 --> 21:49.719
- We need to talk to each other.
- Well, OK.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.839
And before you mention the house
again, I know...

21:51.840 --> 21:53.879
- Well, what about the kiss?
- I was...

21:53.880 --> 21:56.079
... getting to that. I'm sorry.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.159
- Is it me?
- I'm...

21:58.160 --> 22:01.519
- I mean, do you not want to... 
- No! No!

22:01.520 --> 22:04.816
You and Stevie are everything.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.159
I'm sorry.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.649
I am start... starting to feel
a little less... outside myself.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.799
Maybe it's 'cause I got my period
again. Might be a release thing.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.479
I actually love menstruating.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.960
- Wow.
- Yeah.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.559
I think it's, um...

22:24.560 --> 22:28.439
... it's taken me a while
to get over the... birth.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.315
- I get that.
- Yeah.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.400
Yeah.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.759
I think I can do this California thing.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.439
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.599
Oh, fuck it. Let's do it.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.679
- What about Verity?
- No, she is thrilled.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.119
Yeah, she, um... She's gonna
come over for three months,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.279
- help us settle in and... 
- Oh, good.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.999
Um, what about her counselling?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.999
Oh, she's all about LA courses now.
Wants to be a death doula.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.799
And I was thinking maybe
I should finish my masters

22:57.800 --> 22:59.799
- 'cause Berkley's in California.
- Yeah...

22:59.800 --> 23:02.639
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it is. I mean, it's far.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.959
It's pretty expensive, but, I mean,
let's just talk about it.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.479
We can keep talking about it and...

23:06.480 --> 23:08.079
- Can we?
- This is delicious.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.880
It is. It's really good.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.119
I'll get the keys.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.279
Yeah, can we change positions?
She's right in my eye line.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.879
Yes, sure, sure, sure.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.159
- Ooh... You go first.
- Whoops, sorry.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.919
I'll swap you,
you can help me with that.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.359
- That was good.
- Yeah.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.200
- It was really good.
- Yep.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.119
- Having a good night?
- Oh, Jesus! You're...

24:39.120 --> 24:42.199
- You are omnipresent.
- Mate, I'm everywhere.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.599
- Recognise the car. Saw all that.
- Oh, good.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.399
- OK, mate, thanks.
- Thank <i>you</i>, mate.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.119
Thanks for the show. Who are you?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.039
Yeah, I know him.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.079
But I don't know you.
You're the ball and chain, are ya?

24:53.080 --> 24:54.559
Yeah. That's it. Is that all right?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.319
- You're with this one?
- Yes.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.440
- Are ya?
- Yeah.

24:57.441 --> 24:59.119
You know what you've done here
is illegal...

24:59.120 --> 25:01.439
- OK.
- ... in public and in front of a minor.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.119
You probably traumatised
the little fella.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.519
Should be ashamed of yourself.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.719
Nah, only kidding, mate.
Should be proud. Good on ya.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.280
Only young once... 
and middle-aged once.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.559
- Anyway, off you fuck.
- OK.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.479
You're in my office.
Got a minute to get out of here.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.119
- Going.
- Thank you.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.959
- Have a good one. Hey, safe travels.
- Thank you. Yep.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.680
OK, well, she's awake.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.440
God, I have become my mother.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.200
What the fffuck?

25:45.480 --> 25:46.959
- Harry?
- Jezza.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.080
- Yeah. Hi.
- G'day, mate.

25:48.081 --> 25:50.039
Just... just reading the contract.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.679
- Ah, good. You got it.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

25:52.680 --> 25:56.359
So, a few tweaks on the final draft -
I'll be based in California,

25:56.360 --> 25:58.479
you'll be based
in the manufacturer's workshop.

25:58.480 --> 26:02.199
I'm sorry, say that again.
I... I think I missed that.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.439
I'll be in California,

26:03.440 --> 26:05.079
you'll be based in the head office
in Australia.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.280
What?!

26:06.281 --> 26:07.735
Maybe will be the odd trip
here and there.

26:07.736 --> 26:09.347
There's a ripper conference in October.

26:09.348 --> 26:11.079
You can fly the whole
family out for that.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.999
Right. So it's one conference in LA?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.639
Dallas, baby.
But that's a great city, mate.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.479
Dealey Plaza, all that JFK stuff,
and you will love it...

26:20.561 --> 26:22.479
Hello? Harry?

26:22.480 --> 26:24.679
Are you there? Harry?

26:24.680 --> 26:25.999
Can you hear me?

26:34.080 --> 26:36.840
"Mid-stream" - that's ridiculous.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.520
- Aud?
- Hang on, just a sec.

26:48.680 --> 26:53.760
One, two, three, four, five.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.760
Eww.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.920
Oh, God.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.239
No baby. No baby. No baby.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.199
No baby. No baby. No baby. No baby.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.719
Oh, thank Christ! Oh, thank...

27:21.720 --> 27:23.280
Oh, wow.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.760
You will be happy to know we are
only taking one child to California.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.360
Adelaide.

27:37.480 --> 27:40.719
The job's actually in... Adelaide.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.920
It's a communication breakdown.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.120
What?

27:45.121 --> 27:48.519
It's... Adelaide.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.039
You're fucking kidding me?

27:50.040 --> 27:52.120
We're going to Adelai... Oh...

27:53.960 --> 27:57.439
But good news... about the...

27:57.440 --> 27:59.840
... about the minus sign, right?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.719
No, it's a cross sign on the test.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.479
Not a minus sign on it.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.159
You want a minus on the test
for a negative.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.359
- No, you don't. It's a cross.
- You want a minus on the test for it.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.759
- No, it's a cross for no baby.
- No, that's not a cross.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.319
- Yes, it is. No... 
- That's a plus sign.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.719
Do you know how sometimes you get
confused about some of that stuff

28:19.720 --> 28:22.319
where like at the airport you go to
arrivals instead of departures...

28:22.320 --> 28:23.520
No, I don't. That's it.

28:23.521 --> 28:25.879
... because you think that someone's
about to arrive somewhere...

28:25.880 --> 28:28.199
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.599
- You think it means one thing... 
- Oh, my God.

28:30.600 --> 28:34.439
- ... but it means another... 
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.839
Oh, God.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.519
We'll have two under two in Adelaide.
Oh, my God!
