See? Look at the picture.

Look how it's slanting and jumping around.

00:24.943 --> 00:26.486
Yeah, I see that, Grandpa.

00:26.569 --> 00:27.946
It's the tracking. I'm trying to fix it.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.240
It normally doesn't look like that.

00:30.323 --> 00:32.284
I know. I'm working on it.

00:32.367 --> 00:34.619
Well, now it's worse.

Uh, you know, Grandpa Hampton,

00:36.413 --> 00:38.498
we might be ignoring
the larger issue here.

00:38.581 --> 00:40.333
Nobody uses VCRs anymore.

Why don't we throw that guy in the garbage

a brand new Blu-ray player?

I don't want any lasers in my home.

Don't tell me who wins!

All right. I give up.

01:01.271 --> 01:02.939
The stress that it's gonna take
for me to fix this

01:03.022 --> 01:05.066
is not worth the $3 to buy you a new VCR.

01:05.150 --> 01:06.776
We're gonna go out and get you one.

to get a tasty shawarma

I was flying my kite

01:42.270 --> 01:44.689
I got stuck in a tree once.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.274
In Korea.

We were parachuting in,

I tried to cut myself down,

of four commie soldiers

02:06.836 --> 02:08.588
coming towards me.

I'm trying not to make a sound.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.176
The bastards are right underneath me.

02:13.259 --> 02:17.347
And then one of them bends down
and picks up my knife.

02:17.430 --> 02:20.808

two seconds before they look up.

Oh, man. Did you survive, Pop-pop?

02:28.483 --> 02:30.485
Oh, I did, but they didn't.

02:30.569 --> 02:31.903
I killed all of 'em.

02:38.451 --> 02:41.287
one of them's still got
a little fight left in him.

06:11.122 --> 06:13.291
Dude, of course. Love to hug.

06:15.752 --> 06:19.171
Brah, little bit loose of a hug,
don't you think?

06:19.255 --> 06:22.007
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll tighten up.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.593
Aw, that's nice.

06:25.303 --> 06:27.847
And then, out of nowhere, he's just dead.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.348
I'm sorry, babe.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.016
At least you got to know him a little bit.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.978
Yeah. He was a war hero.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.981
Very fond of the film Twins.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.525
That's about all I know,
but he seemed like an interesting guy.

06:39.609 --> 06:41.360
Are any of your grandparents still alive?

06:41.444 --> 06:43.696
Just my grandma on my dad's side,

06:43.780 --> 06:45.906
but she lives in India
and she doesn't speak English,

06:45.990 --> 06:46.991
she just speaks Tamil,

06:47.074 --> 06:50.119
so we've basically had the same
conversation a million times.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.788
I'll call up. She goes, "Hello!"

06:51.871 --> 06:55.792
Then I go, "Hi, Amma. How are you?

06:55.875 --> 06:57.376
I'm good.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.754
All right,
I'm gonna put my dad on now. Bye."

06:59.838 --> 07:01.714
Have you ever tried to learn Tamil?

07:01.798 --> 07:03.758
No. Have you ever tried to learn Tamil?

07:03.842 --> 07:05.009
It's fucking hard.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.052
It's a weird language.

07:07.136 --> 07:08.888
Last time I was in India,
though, I was like,

07:08.971 --> 07:11.140
"Okay, I'm gonna sit down with my grandma,

07:11.223 --> 07:12.558
I'm gonna have my dad translate,

07:12.642 --> 07:14.143
and I'm gonna learn about her life."

07:14.226 --> 07:16.437
But then I got there,
and I just watched Dexter on my iPad.

07:16.521 --> 07:19.524
Ooh, I've always wanted to go to India
and watch Dexter.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.566
It's amazing.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.902
But even if she did live here
and spoke English,

07:22.985 --> 07:24.654
I feel like I would never visit her,
you know?

07:24.737 --> 07:26.030
'Cause that's what we all do.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.449
We just let old people chill out alone.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.702
And then they just die.

07:30.785 --> 07:32.704
God, now you've got me feeling bad.

07:32.787 --> 07:34.121
My grandma Carol lives in the Bronx,

07:34.205 --> 07:35.832
and I hardly ever go and see her.

07:35.915 --> 07:37.458
I should go visit her.

07:37.542 --> 07:38.543
Hey, you want to come?

07:38.626 --> 07:39.794
Hmm, I don't know.

07:39.878 --> 07:41.629
Is she one of those racist grandmas

07:41.713 --> 07:43.422
that's gonna be weird around
someone with my skin tone?

07:43.506 --> 07:45.424
I don't know.
Could be a fun gamble, though.

07:45.508 --> 07:48.594
It says here he left you
something called "Paro."

07:48.678 --> 07:49.721
You know what that is?

07:49.804 --> 07:50.930
What?

07:51.013 --> 07:52.223
What is that?

07:53.808 --> 07:57.645
Oh, man. It's this weird robotic seal.

07:57.729 --> 07:58.855
What does it do?

07:58.979 --> 07:59.898
I don't know.

07:59.939 --> 08:01.273
It, like, blinks sometimes

08:01.357 --> 08:03.526
and wags its tail.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.985
Well, he wanted you to have it.

08:05.069 --> 08:06.779
I think you should at least
take it home with you.

08:06.863 --> 08:08.406
Oh, Dad, this thing's pretty heavy,

08:08.489 --> 08:09.990
and I don't want to carry it
around all day.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.493
Do you mind taking it back
to my apartment, please?

08:12.577 --> 08:15.079
No. Why would I make a trip
to your apartment just for that?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.081
Because you love me?

08:24.630 --> 08:26.424
Come in.

08:41.272 --> 08:42.231
Look at her.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.400
Isn't she the most beautiful
girl you've ever seen?

08:44.483 --> 08:46.235
She is.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.320
Now, who are you?

08:48.404 --> 08:50.114
This is my friend Dev.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.824
Hey, nice to meet you, Grandma Carol.

08:51.908 --> 08:54.744
Ahh, just a friend. Nothing romantic here?

08:54.827 --> 08:56.913
Yeah, we're seeing each other.

08:56.996 --> 09:00.249
That's great. You seem very nice.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.500
Oh, thank you.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.961
I'll admit, I was a little worried.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.587
Some of my friends have racist grandmas.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.671
Oh, I see.

09:05.755 --> 09:06.881
You assumed I was a racist

09:06.965 --> 09:08.132
just because I'm old.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.675
That's nice.

09:09.759 --> 09:10.969
Well, now the tables have turned.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.136
I'm sorry.

09:13.137 --> 09:16.223
So what did Rachel tell you about me?

09:16.307 --> 09:18.517
Um, she said
your husband fought in the war

09:18.601 --> 09:21.312
and that you love strawberry lemonade.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.774
Wow. What a biography. Thanks, Rachel.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.150
I told him other things.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.151
He just forgot.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.402
No, you didn't.

09:28.486 --> 09:29.445
Let me hear it from the source.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.030
Come on, Grandma Carol.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.907
Tell me,
is the strawberry lemonade thing true?

09:32.991 --> 09:35.200
Yes. What else do you want to know?

09:35.284 --> 09:36.953
Um, well, it's pretty nuts

09:37.036 --> 09:38.537
that you've been in New York so long.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.039
What was it like here
when you were growing up?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.624
What did your parents do?

09:41.707 --> 09:43.334
My father was a blacksmith.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.629
He made all the horseshoes
for the horses and buggies.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.047
So there was, like, horse and buggies

09:48.130 --> 09:49.465
just trotting down Bleeker Street?

09:49.548 --> 09:50.967
That's insane.

09:51.050 --> 09:52.844
The other day
I pressed a button on my phone,

09:52.927 --> 09:55.220
and some dude went and grabbed
me groceries from Whole Foods.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.681
We've really come a long way.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.683
Hello?

10:00.559 --> 10:02.227
Are you kidding me?

10:02.311 --> 10:04.814
He won't.

10:04.897 --> 10:08.651
Okay, okay.
Um, I'll come as soon as I can.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.903
All right, bye.

10:10.987 --> 10:12.446
I am so sorry.

10:12.530 --> 10:13.531
This band that I work with

10:13.614 --> 10:14.907
is playing Fallon tonight,

10:14.991 --> 10:16.742
but their drummer just did some mushrooms

10:16.826 --> 10:19.578
and he thinks he's a dinosaur
and won't go onstage.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.163
So I have to go and deal with this.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.375
You have to leave already?
You just got here.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.377
- You work too much.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Grandma.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.170
I'll come back and visit as soon as I can.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.714
I promise.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.131
All right, Dev. Let's go.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.718
Um, you know, why don't I stay here

10:33.801 --> 10:35.427
and hang with Grandma Carol?

10:35.511 --> 10:37.013
We should finish our game.

10:37.096 --> 10:38.389
And, you know,
I'll just meet up with you later.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.224
Uh, you sure?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.517
Yeah. We'll be fine.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.520
Okay. Um, text me if you need anything.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.604
All right.

10:45.688 --> 10:46.981
Okay.

10:47.065 --> 10:48.524
Bye, Grandma.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.608
Yes, darling.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.569
I love you. Bye.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.949
What the hell does Rachel do for a living?

10:57.033 --> 10:58.743
Do you understand her job?

10:58.826 --> 11:03.288
She does music PR, so,
you know, she's in charge of--

11:05.165 --> 11:07.085
All right, I don't know what she does.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.836
We get free tickets for concerts, though.

11:08.920 --> 11:09.754
It's nice.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.924
--twelve years old, and she was a nun.

11:13.007 --> 11:14.341
Talk about pressure.

11:14.425 --> 11:15.760
Whoa!

11:15.843 --> 11:17.302
Ho!

11:18.596 --> 11:19.513
Come on! Hit 'em.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.810
Oh!

11:24.894 --> 11:26.145
Hit 'em. Hit 'em. Hit 'em.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.229
Yeah!

11:30.232 --> 11:31.734
What do you want?

11:31.817 --> 11:33.069
Trying to watch TV.

11:35.154 --> 11:36.238
You want to watch with me?

11:37.406 --> 11:39.199
All right.

11:39.283 --> 11:43.621
--uh, my life has been just
getting better and better.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.705
Mine, too.

11:44.789 --> 11:46.373
I'm so happy, Vincent.

11:46.457 --> 11:48.584
I feel like sometimes, like

11:48.667 --> 11:49.585
picking you up!

11:49.668 --> 11:51.587
Whoa!

11:51.670 --> 11:53.672
Hug you, hug you, hug you!

11:53.756 --> 11:54.924
You liking this?

11:56.508 --> 11:58.427
And then we jump into a helicopter, right?

11:58.510 --> 11:59.845
But there's all these infected zombies,

11:59.929 --> 12:01.180
and they form, like, this zombie pyramid,

12:01.263 --> 12:02.389
and they're all trying to climb in.

12:02.473 --> 12:03.641
But I'm on a machine gun like...

12:05.225 --> 12:07.728
And then later, the scientist
is with the president, right?

12:07.812 --> 12:08.729
And the president's like,

12:08.813 --> 12:10.355
"What's the situation in Kentucky?"

12:10.439 --> 12:11.941
And the scientist is like,
"Kentucky, Madam President?

12:12.024 --> 12:14.026
Kentucky is gone.
The sickening, it got them all."

12:14.110 --> 12:15.444
And then later on,

12:15.527 --> 12:16.946
I sacrifice my life, and I save Colin.

12:17.029 --> 12:19.073
And then Colin goes on to save the world.

12:19.157 --> 12:21.533
Not for me. Sounds frivolous.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.702
You know what I like?

12:23.786 --> 12:25.370
Blacklist. It's a great show.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.206
You need to get on Blacklist.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.415
All right.

12:28.499 --> 12:30.042
Everything okay in here?

12:30.126 --> 12:32.419
With us, yes.
You, I'm not so sure about.

12:32.503 --> 12:33.838
This handsome young man

12:33.921 --> 12:35.756
may be stealing me away from you, Michael.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.175
Yeah, Michael.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.801
Carol said you never take her out anymore.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.636
Well, you be careful.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.013
She's a handful.

12:44.098 --> 12:45.016
He seems nice.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.725
I hate that guy.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.811
What's he so damn chipper about?

12:48.894 --> 12:51.355
He steals our phone chargers. I know it.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.273
I don't know if that's really
a profitable racket.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.193
- Are you sure?
- Oh, I'm sure.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.319
He's not in it for the money.
It's about power.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.990
This may be weird to ask,
but why are you even here?

13:01.073 --> 13:03.242
You seem like you can
take care of yourself.

13:03.325 --> 13:06.162
I was completely fine.

13:06.245 --> 13:09.207
And then one day, I fell,
and everyone panicked,

13:09.289 --> 13:12.459
and they put me in this god-awful place.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.086
It doesn't seem so bad.

13:14.170 --> 13:17.631
You got puzzles, books--
Mostly Bibles,

13:17.715 --> 13:19.383
but there's a few Koontzes in there.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.343
There's nothing to do here.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.594
"Come on, Carol, let's go sit

13:22.678 --> 13:24.513
in the butterfly garden for 15 minutes."

13:24.596 --> 13:26.849
I don't want to see any more
goddamn butterflies.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.351
Oh, that sucks. I'm sorry.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.311
That's what happens when you get old.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.147
You get dumped in one of these places,

13:33.231 --> 13:35.607
and they give you a little robotic seal.

13:36.692 --> 13:38.318
Paro?

13:38.402 --> 13:39.653
You know Paro?

13:39.737 --> 13:41.239
Yeah, my friend's grandpa had one,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.489
but he's dead now.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.116
Sorry.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.910
I'm really hungry.
We should have some dinner.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.578
Do they have any food here?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.955
The food here is terrible.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.583
You know what would be great?

13:52.666 --> 13:54.543
Bamonte's.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.461
That old-school Italian red sauce place?

13:56.545 --> 13:57.922
Let's go!

13:58.005 --> 13:58.964
All right. Sure.

13:59.048 --> 14:01.175
Yeah, I'm not doing anything else.
Let's go.

14:01.259 --> 14:03.761
You distract the orderly
while I make a run for it.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.637
Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

14:05.721 --> 14:07.639
I can't leave the home
unless I'm with someone

14:07.723 --> 14:09.433
who's on the approved chaperones list.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.976
You're not on the list.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.895
Why don't we just sneak out?

14:12.978 --> 14:14.272
People do it all the time.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.647
I don't know, Grandma Carol.

14:15.731 --> 14:16.982
Maybe we should just stay here.

14:17.066 --> 14:18.150
I won't want us to get in trouble.

14:18.234 --> 14:21.112
Fine, then the other option is,
you stay here with me,

14:21.195 --> 14:23.906
and then we go to tonight's show.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.533
The Amazing Brandon.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.286
The endless handkerchief?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.288
That's his headlining trick?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.496
Very underwhelming.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.250
He's the owner's nephew.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.710
He's horrible.

14:36.794 --> 14:39.755
"Quarter from behind your ears"
on the flyer?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.882
Bamonte's.

14:41.966 --> 14:45.261
Bamonte's, Bamonte's, Bamonte's,
Bamonte's, Bamonte's!

14:45.344 --> 14:46.887
All right. Fuck The Amazing Brandon.

14:46.971 --> 14:47.888
Let's go eat.

14:49.431 --> 14:52.643
Hey! There he is. Michael.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.187
So, hey, um, I got a grandpa,

14:55.313 --> 14:57.815
and he's thinking about moving here

14:57.898 --> 14:59.066
to this facility.

14:59.150 --> 15:00.692
And I just wanted to talk to you

15:00.776 --> 15:02.987
'cause I recently saw this Dateline piece

15:03.070 --> 15:05.990
about a retirement facility in Maryland

15:06.073 --> 15:10.244
where, uh, the workers were
practicing wrestling moves

15:10.328 --> 15:11.703
on the residents.

15:11.787 --> 15:14.081
Some of these clips were pretty brutal.

15:14.165 --> 15:16.250
There was this one guy, Mongo.

15:16.334 --> 15:17.876
He would give people pile drivers.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.919
You know what that is?

15:19.003 --> 15:21.088
That's where you take someone,
you flip them up,

15:21.172 --> 15:23.632
and you slam their head down
like this, boom!

15:23.715 --> 15:25.343
I mean, I don't think my grandpa

15:25.425 --> 15:26.927
could handle something like that.

15:27.011 --> 15:30.264
Oh, we've never had any abuse issues here.

15:30.348 --> 15:32.016
Um, okay.

15:32.099 --> 15:35.519
This one guy who just loved
clotheslining people.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.980
He was just like, "Watch out, Agnes!" Pff!

15:38.063 --> 15:39.773
"Look out, Raymond!" Pff!

15:39.857 --> 15:41.942
"Coming through, Arthur!" Pff!

15:42.026 --> 15:44.362
"Clear the way, Cecilia!" Pff!

15:44.444 --> 15:46.238
"Here I come, Margaret!" Pff!

15:46.322 --> 15:50.159
"All right--"
You know, just awful.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.830
So, Anthony, what are the specials?

15:54.913 --> 15:57.416
Today we have
an excellent chicken Milanese,

15:57.499 --> 15:58.750
a veal Francese,

15:58.834 --> 16:00.294
and my personal favorite,

16:00.378 --> 16:02.462
homemade pappardelle with an oxtail ragù.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.006
Boníssima!

16:04.089 --> 16:05.716
Ooh, Anthony,
you're getting me very excited

16:05.799 --> 16:06.842
with all these dishes.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.135
Carol, I'm a man of many interests,

16:08.219 --> 16:10.054
but my true passion might be pasta.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.056
Rigatoni with vodka sauce?

16:12.139 --> 16:13.265
Gnocchi with Bolognese?

16:13.349 --> 16:15.517
Bamonte's combination salad?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.145
Well, that doesn't sound that exciting,
but I bet it's good.

16:21.232 --> 16:25.903
♪ ♪

16:43.128 --> 16:47.841
So tell me how you met
my lovely granddaughter.

16:47.925 --> 16:51.262
Um, it was at a dance, a formal dance.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.388
Oh, come on.

16:52.471 --> 16:53.513
Tell me the truth.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.266
Don't treat me like some old prude.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.768
All right. Well, we met at a bar.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.438
And we both got pretty drunk,

17:00.562 --> 17:03.982
and, uh, we hooked up that night.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.443
Then you started dating?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.903
No, that night got a little complicated

17:07.986 --> 17:09.738
for reasons I probably shouldn't get into.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.490
But we ran into each other
a few weeks later.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.284
Then you started dating?

17:13.367 --> 17:17.329
No, she was still seeing
her ex-boyfriend at that time,

17:17.413 --> 17:18.872
but they eventually broke up.

17:18.956 --> 17:21.083
And we started texting back and forth.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.709
We took a trip to Nashville together.

17:22.793 --> 17:24.253
And then we started dating.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.422
Wow.

17:26.505 --> 17:29.258
There were much fewer steps
for me and Harry.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.051
What was it like dating back then?

17:31.135 --> 17:33.595
Seems like everything was
a little nicer and simpler.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.557
A guy from the neighborhood
came up and said,

17:37.641 --> 17:39.101
"You're beautiful.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.852
I'm gonna marry you."

17:40.936 --> 17:43.605
Then he did.
Then you raise a bunch of kids.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.400
Your husband dies.
Your kids put you in a home.

17:46.484 --> 17:48.068
And then you're eating pasta

17:48.152 --> 17:50.654
with your granddaughter's
ethnic boyfriend.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.406
Seems nice, though.

17:52.490 --> 17:54.366
You committed to a relationship,
and it worked.

17:54.450 --> 17:57.119
You weren't constantly concerned
about what else was out there.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.162
I was lucky.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.704
Other people were miserable.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.248
And everything happened so fast.

18:01.332 --> 18:03.792
I was raising a family
when I was 20 years old.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.420
Wow, I definitely couldn't
have done that when I was 20.

18:06.504 --> 18:08.630
Would have been hard to support
a family on school credit

18:08.713 --> 18:11.800
that I was earning for my
internship at Nickelodeon.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.927
There must have been
some fun times, though.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.013
I once hitchhiked to Atlantic City

18:16.096 --> 18:18.640
on an ice truck to see Sinatra.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.808
See? That's a story.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.519
What am I gonna tell my kids?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.437
"Oh, once my mom drove me to see
Hootie and the Blowfish."

18:23.562 --> 18:25.523
You'll have stories, believe me.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.773
I hope so.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.443
All right, so let's say

18:29.527 --> 18:31.028
you didn't have to settle down so quick.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.446
What do you think you would have done?

18:32.530 --> 18:34.739
I don't know. I always loved music.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.201
Maybe something in that field.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.371
I wish Rachel still played music.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.247
Her band was fantastic.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.915
Rachel was in a band? I didn't know that.

18:43.999 --> 18:50.881
It was called... a scam band,
or a... scar band.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.924
Wait, Rachel was in a ska band?

18:53.008 --> 18:55.010
Yeah.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.721
Her band was called Nostraskamus?

18:59.264 --> 19:00.849
Grandma Carol, please give me this photo.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.434
Can I have it? Please, please, please.

19:02.518 --> 19:03.768
I'm begging you. Let me have it, please?

19:03.852 --> 19:05.354
Why don't you borrow it

19:05.479 --> 19:08.232
and bring it back
when you visit me next week?

19:08.315 --> 19:10.108
Deal.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.070
You ready to get dinner?

19:13.153 --> 19:14.779
Yeah, one sec.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.616
Just finishing this
beautiful stallion's mane.

19:18.576 --> 19:19.743
Perfect.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.373
Hey, Dad, do you mind
if Paro comes to dinner with us?

19:24.456 --> 19:25.874
That puppet thing?

19:25.957 --> 19:28.544
Oh, no. I'm just kidding.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.295
Never mind.

19:38.429 --> 19:40.055
Warm?

19:41.557 --> 19:43.016
See you after dinner, buddy.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.520
All right, Grandma Carol.

19:46.604 --> 19:48.522
We broke you out of your retirement home.

19:48.606 --> 19:51.149
You hitchhiked
on an ice truck to see Sinatra.

19:51.233 --> 19:55.028
Between us,
what's the worst thing you've ever done?

19:55.112 --> 19:58.031
Well, one time, before the kids were born,

19:58.115 --> 19:59.491
I stole a car.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.535
What? Grandma Carol!

20:01.619 --> 20:02.661
How did that happen?

20:02.744 --> 20:04.538
I was walking on the street,

20:04.622 --> 20:06.915
and I saw a man leave his car running

20:06.998 --> 20:09.293
and go into a store.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.628
For some reason, I felt like

20:10.710 --> 20:13.171
I had to get in and start driving.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.341
I don't know what came over me.

20:16.425 --> 20:18.302
I just had to do it.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.598
I got on the highway and took off.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.183
The car was a convertible.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.103
I still remember the wind on my face.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.688
For the first time in years,

20:29.771 --> 20:31.773
I felt like I could go anywhere,

20:31.856 --> 20:33.484
do anything.

20:33.567 --> 20:36.654
The possibilities were endless.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.323
Then something happened to the car.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.616
I don't know what.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.701
It started making strange noises,

20:42.784 --> 20:44.578
and the hood started smoking.

20:44.662 --> 20:46.371
I thought about calling my brother Johnny,

20:46.455 --> 20:49.625
who was a mechanic, but I was pretty sure

20:49.708 --> 20:52.503
he'd be mad at me for being a thief.

20:52.586 --> 20:57.716
So I just pulled over,
got out, and walked away.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.386
Harry never even knew.

21:01.470 --> 21:02.762
Got on a bus, came home,

21:02.846 --> 21:05.015
cleaned the house, made us dinner.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.766
Wow.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.935
But you didn't really steal the car.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.979
You kind of just moved it
to a random place.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.732
Oh, hold on. Oh, it's Rachel.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.108
I'll see if she wants to meet up.

21:15.192 --> 21:16.151
- Hey.
- Hey!

21:16.234 --> 21:17.695
I just got a call from the home,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.404
and they said that my grandma's missing.

21:19.488 --> 21:21.657
What happened when you left?
Did she say anything?

21:21.740 --> 21:23.783
Oh, no, no, no. She's fine.
She's here with me right now.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.620
What? Where are you?

21:26.704 --> 21:28.413
At Bamonte's?

21:28.497 --> 21:29.998
She told me it'd be fine
if we snuck out for a few hours,

21:30.081 --> 21:31.667
as long as we got back before curfew.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.917
She's fine. I promise.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.461
Oh, thank God she's okay.

21:34.545 --> 21:36.129
Could you just take her back to the home?

21:36.213 --> 21:37.589
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm really sorry.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.342
I'll bring her back right now.
We'll just meet you at the home.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.677
Bye.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.220
I'm in deep shit now, Grandma Carol.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.055
I heard. It's fine.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.682
Thanks for taking me out.

21:46.765 --> 21:50.101
Let me go to the bathroom,
and then we'll go.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.144
All right.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.276
Hey. What's that in your backpack?

21:58.360 --> 22:00.738
You know the rules.
No pets in the building.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.906
Oh, it's not a pet. It's just Paro.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.409
He's the best. You want to pet him?

22:05.492 --> 22:07.077
Why would I want to do that?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.912
Here, hold him.

22:12.082 --> 22:14.752
What is this?

22:16.127 --> 22:19.005
He's kind of cute. Hi.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.507
Hey, I got to go meet a friend.

22:20.591 --> 22:23.134
You want to hold on to him for a while?

22:23.218 --> 22:25.387
Yeah, all right, if it'll help you out.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.638
Thanks, Gideon.

22:31.727 --> 22:32.728
Goodbye, friend.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.354
Paro, how are you?

22:45.824 --> 22:47.909
Grandma Carol?

22:47.992 --> 22:49.953
Carol, you in there?

22:52.706 --> 22:54.541
Hey, excuse me.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.126
Do you mind going in the bathroom

22:56.209 --> 22:57.544
and seeing if there's
an old lady in there?

22:57.628 --> 22:58.962
What?

22:59.045 --> 23:00.922
I had dinner with this grandma,

23:01.005 --> 23:03.634
and she went to the bathroom,
and she's been taking a while,

23:03.717 --> 23:06.553
so I just want to make sure
she didn't fall down and die.

23:06.637 --> 23:08.054
To be clear, this is not my grandma.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.681
It's my girlfriend's grandma.

23:09.765 --> 23:13.017
So it's a white grandma,
not an Indian grandma.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.437
Okay.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.688
Thank you so much.

23:16.772 --> 23:17.648
Yeah.

23:33.913 --> 23:34.748
Uh...

23:35.332 --> 23:36.916
No grandmas, white or Indian.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.585
Aw, you got to be shitting me.

23:38.669 --> 23:40.003
Can I go to the bathroom now?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.713
Yeah, yeah. Sorry for the outburst.

23:41.797 --> 23:42.798
Yeah.

23:43.674 --> 23:44.842
Where could she be?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.677
Did she mention anything else?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.178
She likes that show Blacklist.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.971
- How is that helpful, Dev?
- I don't know.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.348
You asked if she mentioned anything else.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.683
She mentioned she likes Blacklist.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.810
I'm not a detective.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.603
You know who could find her?

23:56.687 --> 23:58.814
Red Reddington,
James Spader's character in Blacklist.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.231
Shut up!

24:00.315 --> 24:01.566
Look, your grandma's fine, okay?

24:01.650 --> 24:03.067
She's not this frail old lady.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.778
She can take care of herself.

24:04.862 --> 24:06.404
She once hitchhiked
on an ice truck to see Sinatra.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.823
She's a badass.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.282
Wait.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.034
I think I know where she might be.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.536
Oh, so Blacklist did help.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.078
No, it didn't help.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.330
Well, it clearly
inspired a train of thought

24:15.413 --> 24:16.373
that was helpful.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.336
