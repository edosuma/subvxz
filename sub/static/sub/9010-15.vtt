WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:12.876
OH, DUDE,

00:08.542 --> 00:12.876
CHECK IT OUT!

00:08.542 --> 00:12.876
"UNBRIDLED MAYHEM."

00:12.918 --> 00:16.209
THE VIDEO GAME SO DISTURBING,

00:12.918 --> 00:16.209
IT COMES WITH A NIGHT LIGHT.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.375
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THIS.

00:18.417 --> 00:21.042
I KNOW, 'CAUSE

00:18.417 --> 00:21.042
I NEED A NEW NIGHT LIGHT.

00:21.083 --> 00:22.834
MINE'S SO BABYISH.

00:24.417 --> 00:27.876
NOT SO FAST, PUNK.

00:27.918 --> 00:30.042
WHO ARE YOU?

00:30.083 --> 00:33.042
THE NAME'S BRYAN,

00:30.083 --> 00:33.042
WITH A "Y."

00:33.083 --> 00:35.959
AND AN "R" AND AN "A"

00:33.083 --> 00:35.959
AND AN "N" AND A "B."

00:36.000 --> 00:37.209
BUT NOT IN THAT ORDER.

00:37.250 --> 00:40.042
WALLACE AND CLYDE

00:37.250 --> 00:40.042
LEFT ME IN CHARGE

00:40.083 --> 00:42.000
WHILE THEY'RE AT

00:40.083 --> 00:42.000
THE IDENTICAL TWIN

00:42.042 --> 00:44.250
COMIC BOOK STORE

00:42.042 --> 00:44.250
OWNERS' CONVENTION.

00:44.292 --> 00:46.167
AND I'M NOT GONNA

00:44.292 --> 00:46.167
SELL YOU THIS GAME.

00:46.209 --> 00:47.542
IT'S TOO INTENSE,

00:47.584 --> 00:49.209
AND YOU ARE NOT

00:47.584 --> 00:49.209
MATURE ENOUGH TO PLAY IT.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.042
BRYAN, MY GOOD MAN,

00:53.083 --> 00:55.584
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT

00:53.083 --> 00:55.584
MY ASSOCIATE AND I

00:55.626 --> 00:58.417
ARE EXCEPTIONALLY MATURE,

00:58.459 --> 01:02.375
SO MATURE, IN FACT,

00:58.459 --> 01:02.375
THAT WE PRONOUNCE

00:58.459 --> 01:02.375
"MATURE" "MATOOR."

01:04.042 --> 01:06.000
IF YOU REPLACE

01:04.042 --> 01:06.000
THE "T" IN MATURE

01:06.042 --> 01:10.042
WITH AN "N,"

01:06.042 --> 01:10.042
IT SPELLS "MANURE."

01:10.083 --> 01:12.542
THAT'S COW POOP.

01:12.584 --> 01:14.626
YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS GAME.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.459
PERIOD.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.042
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE

01:16.500 --> 01:20.042
AN EXCLAMATION POINT

01:16.500 --> 01:20.042
THAN A PERIOD.

01:20.083 --> 01:23.292
YOU LISTEN HERE...

01:20.083 --> 01:23.292
COLON.

01:23.334 --> 01:27.042
NO GAME FOR YOU!

01:23.334 --> 01:27.042
EXCLAMATION POINT.

01:23.334 --> 01:27.042
UNDERSTAND?

01:27.083 --> 01:28.918
QUESTION MARK.

01:33.334 --> 01:35.459
MAYBE IT'S JUST

01:33.334 --> 01:35.459
AS WELL, KAZ.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.459
IF WE BOUGHT THE GAME

01:35.500 --> 01:37.459
WE'D PLAY IT ALL WEEKEND

01:35.500 --> 01:37.459
INSTEAD OF FINISHING

01:37.500 --> 01:39.167
OUR BIOLOGY LAB

01:37.500 --> 01:39.167
THAT'S DUE MONDAY.

01:39.209 --> 01:42.375
- WHAT BIOLOGY LAB?

01:39.209 --> 01:42.375
- FOR THE PAST MONTH,

01:42.417 --> 01:45.125
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:42.417 --> 01:45.125
HAVE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHING

01:42.417 --> 01:45.125
AND CHARTING THE DEVELOPMENT

01:45.167 --> 01:47.959
OF CATERPILLAR LARVAE

01:45.167 --> 01:47.959
INTO BUTTERFLIES.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.584
I MUST HAVE BEEN ABSENT

01:48.000 --> 01:50.584
WHEN THEY ASSIGNED

01:48.000 --> 01:50.584
THAT PROJECT.

01:50.626 --> 01:52.250
NO, YOU WERE THERE.

01:52.292 --> 01:54.042
YOU GOT THEM,

01:52.292 --> 01:54.042
LIKE, A MONTH AGO.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.334
I REMEMBER YOU LAUGHED

01:54.083 --> 01:56.334
BECAUSE THE WORD "BUTTERFLY"

01:56.375 --> 01:58.209
HAS THE WORD "BUTT" IN IT.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.167
AS SO MANY WORDS DO.

02:01.209 --> 02:06.125
BUTTER, BUTTERMILK,

02:01.209 --> 02:06.125
BUTTS.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.584
ANYWAY, I DON'T REMEMBER

02:06.167 --> 02:09.584
BEING GIVEN ANY

02:06.167 --> 02:09.584
CATERPILLAR LARVAE.

02:14.167 --> 02:17.626
OH, NOW I REMEMBER.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.626
I PUT THEM IN

02:17.667 --> 02:19.626

I'M PERFORMING

03:13.334 --> 03:15.459
A GROUNDBREAKING PROCEDURE.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.667
WHY ARE YOU OPERATING

03:15.500 --> 03:17.667
ON A TOY?

03:17.709 --> 03:20.626
IF YOU'RE TRYING

03:17.709 --> 03:20.626
TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES,

03:17.709 --> 03:20.626
YOU'RE USING THE WRONG TOOL.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.542
YOU NEED A TEENY-TINY

03:20.667 --> 03:22.542
PHILLIPS HEAD.

03:22.584 --> 03:25.042
DON'T MAKE FUN

03:22.584 --> 03:25.042
OF PHILLIP'S HEAD.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.709
HE'S VERY

03:25.083 --> 03:26.709
SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT.

03:26.751 --> 03:28.542
IT'S NOT NEARLY AS BIG

03:26.751 --> 03:28.542
AS HE WISHES IT WERE.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.042
HEY, PHILLIP.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.042
HEAD'S LOOKING HUGE.

03:33.083 --> 03:36.000
YOU'RE JUST SAYIN' THAT.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.626
WAIT!

03:40.667 --> 03:43.042
THIS ISN'T A TOY.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.042
THAT'S BRAIN MATTER.

03:43.083 --> 03:46.125
IF HE DEFROSTS, HE'LL

03:43.083 --> 03:46.125
TURN INTO A RAMPAGING BEAST.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.375
I THINK I CAN

03:46.167 --> 03:48.375
CURE HIM WITH THIS

03:46.167 --> 03:48.375
EXPERIMENTAL SERUM.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.125
BUT FIRST,

03:48.417 --> 03:50.125
I NEED YOU TO STEP BACK.

03:50.167 --> 03:51.500
- FOR SAFETY?

03:50.167 --> 03:51.500
- NO.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.626
ONE OF YOU HAS

03:51.542 --> 03:53.626
BEEN EATING SALAMI.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.709 --> 04:09.792
WHERE AM I?

04:09.834 --> 04:12.125
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME?

04:12.167 --> 04:14.667
AND WHO'S BEEN

04:12.167 --> 04:14.667
EATING SALAMI?

04:14.709 --> 04:17.375
BRAIN MATTER, IT'S ME,

04:14.709 --> 04:17.375
DR. HORACE DIAZ.

04:17.416 --> 04:19.125
I'VE INJECTED YOU

04:17.416 --> 04:19.125
WITH A SERUM

04:19.166 --> 04:21.375
THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU

04:19.166 --> 04:21.375
ALL THE POWERS

04:21.416 --> 04:23.042
YOU TRIED TO

04:21.416 --> 04:23.042
CREATE FOR YOURSELF,

04:23.083 --> 04:24.584
BUT WITHOUT

04:23.083 --> 04:24.584
THE SIDE EFFECTS.

04:24.626 --> 04:25.584
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

04:25.626 --> 04:27.792
LET'S TEST THOSE POWERS,

04:27.834 --> 04:30.542
STARTING WITH SUPER-VISION.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.542
HOW MANY FINGERS

04:30.584 --> 04:33.209
IS THE MAN ON THE CORNER

04:30.584 --> 04:33.209
OF WALNUT AND 4th HOLDING UP?

04:34.626 --> 04:36.250
THREE.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.083
I'M JUST GONNA

04:37.667 --> 04:39.083
HAVE TO TRUST YOU.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.584
I DON'T HAVE

04:39.125 --> 04:40.584
SUPER-VISION.

04:40.626 --> 04:42.334
NEXT...

04:42.375 --> 04:45.542
USE YOUR TELEKINESIS

04:42.375 --> 04:45.542
TO LIFT THAT FLOWER POT.

04:56.626 --> 04:58.667
SO... NOTHING.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.667
DID YOU SEE THAT?

05:03.709 --> 05:05.876
THE SERUM MUST HAVE ALTERED

05:03.709 --> 05:05.876
SOME OF HIS POWERS.

05:05.918 --> 05:09.042
- NOW HE CAN MAKE THINGS

05:05.918 --> 05:09.042
AGE AND GROW.

05:05.918 --> 05:09.042
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

05:09.083 --> 05:12.209
DO YOU REALIZE

05:09.083 --> 05:12.209
WHAT YOU CAN DO

05:09.083 --> 05:12.209
WITH A POWER LIKE THAT?

05:12.250 --> 05:14.542
END WORLD HUNGER.

05:14.584 --> 05:16.083
RESTORE THE AMAZON

05:14.584 --> 05:16.083
RAIN FOREST.

05:16.125 --> 05:19.709
NO. SOMETHING

05:16.125 --> 05:19.709
THAT AFFECTS ME.

05:19.751 --> 05:21.792
HEY, CAN YOU HELP ME

05:19.751 --> 05:21.792
WITH MY BIOLOGY LAB?

05:21.834 --> 05:24.709
I BET YOU COULD

05:21.834 --> 05:24.709
AGE CATERPILLAR EGGS

05:24.751 --> 05:27.584
INTO BUTTERFLIES IN 30 SECONDS

05:24.751 --> 05:27.584
INSTEAD OF 30 DAYS.

05:27.626 --> 05:30.542
NOT NOW.

05:27.626 --> 05:30.542
I'M WATCHING A MOVIE

05:30.584 --> 05:32.626
IN A THEATER

05:30.584 --> 05:32.626
IN OMAHA.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.042
UGH, I ALWAYS GET STUCK

05:34.709 --> 05:38.042
BEHIND A GUY WITH A GIANT HEAD.

05:39.626 --> 05:42.792
NO ONE EVER COMPLAINS ABOUT

05:39.626 --> 05:42.792
MY HEAD BEING TOO BIG.

05:48.125 --> 05:51.876
SKYLAR, CAN I TALK TO YOU

05:48.125 --> 05:51.876
ABOUT SOMETHING PERSONAL?

05:51.918 --> 05:53.334
NO.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.876
THANKS.

05:55.918 --> 05:58.250
BECAUSE I'M HOPING

05:55.918 --> 05:58.250
YOU CAN HELP ME.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.375
IT'S KINDA HARD

05:58.292 --> 06:00.375
TO SAY THIS,

06:00.417 --> 06:03.751
BUT MY BODY IS STARTING

06:00.417 --> 06:03.751
TO UNDERGO SOME...

06:03.792 --> 06:05.876
CHANGES.

06:05.918 --> 06:08.083
THAT CAN ONLY BE

06:05.918 --> 06:08.083
GOOD NEWS.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.292
WHAT KIND OF CHANGES?

06:10.334 --> 06:15.125
WELL, SOMETIMES,

06:10.334 --> 06:15.125
WHEN I GET SUDDENLY

06:10.334 --> 06:15.125
FRIGHTENED, I...

06:15.167 --> 06:17.167
NO.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.751
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

06:18.792 --> 06:19.918
IT'S TOO EMBARRASSING.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.709
IT'S OKAY, ALAN.

06:21.751 --> 06:23.792
YOU DON'T HAVE

06:21.751 --> 06:23.792
TO TELL ME.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.667
BECAUSE I CAN

06:23.834 --> 06:25.667
JUST DO THIS... BOO!

06:25.709 --> 06:27.500
( shrieks )

06:27.542 --> 06:29.584
SEE?

06:29.626 --> 06:32.000
LOOK AT THIS!

06:29.626 --> 06:32.000

06:34.834 --> 06:36.292

06:36.334 --> 06:38.375
WHY DON'T YOU JUST

06:36.334 --> 06:38.375

06:38.417 --> 06:41.334
- I MEAN, HE IS YOUR UNCLE.

06:38.417 --> 06:41.334
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

06:41.375 --> 06:43.500
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE

06:41.375 --> 06:43.500
TALKING TO HIM ABOUT

06:41.375 --> 06:43.500
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

06:43.542 --> 06:46.125
PLEASE, YOU'RE

06:43.542 --> 06:46.125
A GREAT HERO.

06:46.167 --> 06:49.000
YOU DEVOTED YOUR LIFE

06:46.167 --> 06:49.000
TO HELPING PEOPLE.

06:46.167 --> 06:49.000
CAN'T YOU HELP ME?

06:49.042 --> 06:52.792
WOW. YOU REALLY THINK

06:49.042 --> 06:52.792
I'M STILL A HERO?

06:52.834 --> 06:55.083
NO!

06:55.125 --> 06:58.751
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT

06:55.125 --> 06:58.751
TO TRICK YOU INTO

06:55.125 --> 06:58.751
DOING WHAT I WANT.

06:58.792 --> 07:01.709
MAN, YOU ARE REALLY BAD

06:58.792 --> 07:01.709
AT ASKING FOR HELP.

07:02.918 --> 07:05.167
BUT, FINE,

07:02.918 --> 07:05.167
I'LL HELP YOU.

07:05.209 --> 07:07.083
THANK YOU.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.584
BUT JUST PROMISE YOU WON'T

07:07.125 --> 07:09.584
MENTION ANY OF THIS TO

07:07.125 --> 07:09.584
MY UNCLE HORACE.

07:09.626 --> 07:11.542
HE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

07:11.584 --> 07:13.709
AND... HE'S AN AVID HUNTER.

07:20.459 --> 07:22.876
HEY, OWL GIRL.

07:22.918 --> 07:24.834
I HEARD YOU WERE

07:22.918 --> 07:24.834
WITH VERITAS,

07:24.876 --> 07:27.042
THE SUPERHERO

07:24.876 --> 07:27.042
OWL OF TRUTH.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.584
AND YOU KNOW

07:27.083 --> 07:28.584
WHO TOLD ME?

07:28.626 --> 07:31.042
A LITTLE BIRDIE.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.959
GET IT?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.459
ACTUALLY, IT WAS

07:33.000 --> 07:36.459
SOLAR FLARE; SHE'S

07:33.000 --> 07:36.459
KIND OF A GOSSIP.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.959
BRAIN MATTER,

07:36.500 --> 07:38.959
I REALLY APPRECIATE

07:39.000 --> 07:40.959
YOU HELPING ME WITH

07:39.000 --> 07:40.959
MY BIOLOGY LAB.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.667
I WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE

07:41.000 --> 07:43.667
YOU NOT WHINING ABOUT IT.

07:43.709 --> 07:46.667
I'VE BEEN SHRUNK DOWN

07:43.709 --> 07:46.667
AND FROZEN FOR YEARS.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.709
AGING CATERPILLARS

07:46.709 --> 07:48.709
INTO BUTTERFLIES

07:48.751 --> 07:51.417
WASN'T THE FIRST THING

07:48.751 --> 07:51.417
ON MY WISH LIST OF

07:48.751 --> 07:51.417
THINGS TO DO.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.250
WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING

07:51.459 --> 07:53.250
YOU WANTED TO DO?

07:53.292 --> 07:56.542
RETURN THIS MOVIE

07:53.292 --> 07:56.542
I RENTED TO MY LOCAL

07:53.292 --> 07:56.542
VIDEO STORE.

07:56.584 --> 07:58.876
I'M SURE THEY'RE

07:56.584 --> 07:58.876
STILL AROUND, RIGHT?

07:58.918 --> 08:00.709
YEAH, SURE.

08:00.751 --> 08:03.042
MAYBE AFTER THAT, WE CAN

08:00.751 --> 08:03.042
GO GET SOME SNEAKERS

08:03.083 --> 08:04.959
WITH WHEELS ON THEM.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.876
ALREADY GOT 'EM.

08:11.209 --> 08:13.375
OKAY, HERE ARE

08:11.209 --> 08:13.375
THE CATERPILLARS.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.125
LET'S MAKE

08:13.417 --> 08:15.125
SOME BUTTERFLIES.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.417
SOMETHING'S WRONG

08:25.083 --> 08:27.417
WITH YOUR POWER.

08:27.459 --> 08:29.584
INSTEAD OF MAKING

08:27.459 --> 08:29.584
THE CATERPILLARS OLDER,

08:29.626 --> 08:31.626
YOU MADE 'EM YOUNGER.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.208
THEY'RE EGGS NOW.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.792
NO, I HAVE TO TURN IN

08:33.250 --> 08:34.792
THIS REPORT.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.708
I CAN'T GET ANYTHING

08:34.833 --> 08:36.708
LOWER THAN A "C."

08:36.751 --> 08:38.500
OR A "D" AND I CAN

08:36.751 --> 08:38.500
TURN IT INTO A "B"

08:38.542 --> 08:40.751
BY JUST PUTTING

08:38.542 --> 08:40.751
A LITTLE LINE THROUGH IT.

08:43.458 --> 08:47.042
UH-OH. VERITAS

08:43.458 --> 08:47.042
IS AN EGG NOW.

08:43.458 --> 08:47.042
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

08:47.083 --> 08:50.792
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

08:47.083 --> 08:50.792
BUT I'M SKATING

08:47.083 --> 08:50.792
THE HECK OUT OF HERE.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.792
MAN, WHAT DO WE TELL

08:52.834 --> 08:55.792
OWL GIRL?

08:55.834 --> 08:57.709
I VOTE NOTHING.

08:57.751 --> 08:59.834
I AGREE.

08:59.876 --> 09:01.626
SORRY, EGG OF TRUTH.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.000
FEELS SO IRONIC TO HAVE

09:01.667 --> 09:04.000
TO LIE ABOUT THIS.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.042
SKYLAR.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.000
CAN I TALK TO YOU

09:10.083 --> 09:12.000
ABOUT SOMETHING PERSONAL?

09:12.042 --> 09:13.584
NO.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.459
THANKS.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.042
I'M WORRIED ABOUT ALAN.

09:17.083 --> 09:20.709
HE'S ACTING EVEN CREEPIER

09:17.083 --> 09:20.709
THAN USUAL.

09:20.751 --> 09:22.959
I'D ASK HIM WHAT'S WRONG,

09:20.751 --> 09:22.959
BUT I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

09:23.000 --> 09:25.042
DISCUSSING PERSONAL

09:23.000 --> 09:25.042
THINGS WITH HIM.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.834
THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE

09:25.083 --> 09:27.834
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

09:27.876 --> 09:30.042
DISCUSSING PERSONAL

09:27.876 --> 09:30.042
THINGS WITH YOU.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.042
WHY IS THAT FUNNY?

09:32.083 --> 09:34.792
MAYBE IF YOU SAID IT

09:32.083 --> 09:34.792
WITH A FUNNY HAT ON.

09:34.834 --> 09:36.834
NO, STILL NOT FUNNY.

09:39.042 --> 09:41.751
LOOK, THE WAY I SEE IT,

09:39.042 --> 09:41.751
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

09:41.792 --> 09:44.626
YOU CAN TRY TO DEVELOP

09:41.792 --> 09:44.626
A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP

09:41.792 --> 09:44.626
WITH ALAN,

09:44.667 --> 09:46.751
WHO COULD USE

09:44.667 --> 09:46.751
A FATHER FIGURE.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.500
OR YOU CAN TAKE

09:46.792 --> 09:48.500
THE COWARD'S WAY OUT,

09:48.542 --> 09:50.042
AND STICK YOUR HEAD

09:48.542 --> 09:50.042
IN THE SAND.

09:50.083 --> 09:53.000
HORACE DIAZ DOES NOT

09:50.083 --> 09:53.000
STICK HIS HEAD IN THE SAND.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.751
NOT WITH THIS

09:53.042 --> 09:54.751
HEAD OF HAIR.

09:54.792 --> 09:58.042
BUT HE DOES TAKE

09:54.792 --> 09:58.042
THE COWARD'S WAY OUT

09:54.792 --> 09:58.042
WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.751
GOOD TALK.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.083
OLIVER, WAKE UP!

10:05.125 --> 10:08.042
HOW COULD YOU OVERSLEEP?

10:05.125 --> 10:08.042
THAT'S MY THING.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.751
( groaning )

10:09.792 --> 10:12.667
GET UP. WE HAVE TO TRY

10:09.792 --> 10:12.667
TO FIX BRAIN MATTER

10:12.709 --> 10:15.042
SO HE CAN HELP ME WITH

10:12.709 --> 10:15.042
MY BIOLOGY LAB.

10:15.083 --> 10:18.042
COME ON, WAKEY-WAKEY.

10:15.083 --> 10:18.042
EGGS AND...

10:18.083 --> 10:20.042
WHAT THE BAC-Y?!

10:20.083 --> 10:23.626
DUDE, I'M EXHAUSTED.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.709
I WAS SLEEPING

10:23.667 --> 10:25.709
LIKE A BABY.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.918
COME BACK, IN, LIKE,

10:25.751 --> 10:27.918
TEN YEARS.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.667
HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.667
WHAT IS...

10:32.709 --> 10:34.667
( screams )

10:34.709 --> 10:37.083
I LOOK LIKE

10:34.709 --> 10:37.083
I'M FOUR YEARS OLD.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.500
WHEN BRAIN MATTER

10:37.125 --> 10:38.500
REVERSE-AGED

10:38.542 --> 10:40.083
THE CATERPILLARS

10:38.542 --> 10:40.083
AND THE OWL,

10:40.125 --> 10:42.042
YOU MUST'VE BEEN STANDING IN

10:40.125 --> 10:42.042
THE PATH OF HIS POWER.

10:42.083 --> 10:44.834
YOUR BODY REGRESSED

10:42.083 --> 10:44.834
TEN YEARS.

10:44.876 --> 10:46.918
WHY HASN'T MY BRAIN?

10:46.959 --> 10:50.459
AND WHY DIDN'T IT HAPPEN

10:46.959 --> 10:50.459
AS SOON AS I WAS ZAPPED?

10:50.500 --> 10:53.042
AND WHY DID MY CLOTHES

10:50.500 --> 10:53.042
ALSO GET SMALLER?

10:53.083 --> 10:56.042
I DON'T KNOW.

10:53.083 --> 10:56.042
I'M TERRIBLE AT SCIENCE.

10:56.083 --> 10:59.042
MAN, I DIDN'T EVEN DO

10:56.083 --> 10:59.042
MY BIOLOGY LAB.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.918
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

11:00.959 --> 11:03.042
YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T

11:00.959 --> 11:03.042
GO TO HIGH SCHOOL LIKE THIS...

11:03.083 --> 11:05.959
SO CAN I HAVE

11:03.083 --> 11:05.959
YOUR BIOLOGY LAB?

11:11.042 --> 11:12.626
WHY ARE YOU

11:11.042 --> 11:12.626
HOLDING MY HAND?

11:12.667 --> 11:14.751
I DON'T KNOW.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.751
INSTINCTS?

11:14.792 --> 11:16.584
STOP IT.

11:14.792 --> 11:16.584
IT'S WEIRD.

11:16.626 --> 11:18.709
THIS WHOLE THING

11:16.626 --> 11:18.709
IS WEIRD.

11:18.751 --> 11:22.042
WE HAVE TO FIND

11:18.751 --> 11:22.042
BRAIN MATTER, BUT

11:18.751 --> 11:22.042
WE CAN'T LET HORACE KNOW--

11:22.083 --> 11:23.792
OH, KAZ!

11:23.834 --> 11:25.500
WHO IS THIS CUTIE-PATOOTIE?

11:25.542 --> 11:29.626
UM... HE'S MY NEPHEW.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.667
HE'S A SWEETIE PIE.

11:31.709 --> 11:34.042
GUARDS, HAVE THIS ADORABLE

11:31.709 --> 11:34.042
LITTLE BOY TAKEN AWAY

11:34.083 --> 11:35.834

HORACE, IT'S ME, OLIVER.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.042
KAZ, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

NOW HE'S A FOUR-YEAR-OLD,

11:47.709 --> 11:49.792
AND HE'S REALLY CLINGY.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.751
- AMAZING.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.751
- NO, NOT AMAZING.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.584
IT TOOK FOREVER

11:52.792 --> 11:54.584
TO MAKE IT HERE.

11:54.626 --> 11:57.709
HE WANTED TO STOP AND PET

11:54.626 --> 11:57.709
EVERY DOGGIE HE SAW.

11:57.751 --> 12:01.125
GOOD NEWS. I FINE-TUNED

11:57.751 --> 12:01.125
BRAIN MATTER'S AGING POWER

12:01.167 --> 12:02.751
SO HE CAN REVERT YOU

12:01.167 --> 12:02.751
BACK TO NORMAL,

12:02.792 --> 12:04.209
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.918
YES, PLEASE.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.834
THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TOR

12:05.959 --> 12:08.834

12:08.876 --> 12:12.000
OKAY. HOLD STILL.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.959
UH-OH.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.042
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

12:24.083 --> 12:26.876
IT SEEMS WE WENT

12:24.083 --> 12:26.876
A TEENY BIT PAST 14.

12:26.918 --> 12:29.584
A TEENY BIT?

12:29.626 --> 12:31.792
I'M IN MY 30's?!

12:31.834 --> 12:34.876
THAT'S LIKE ALMOST DEAD!

12:34.918 --> 12:37.834
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO DO

12:34.918 --> 12:37.834
SOME MORE TESTS ON BRAIN MATTER.

12:37.876 --> 12:39.751
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED

12:37.876 --> 12:39.751
TO DO IN THE MEANTIME?

12:39.792 --> 12:42.125
START SAVING FOR RETIREMENT?

12:42.167 --> 12:45.876
NEVER MIND.

12:42.167 --> 12:45.876
I KNOW EXACTLY

12:42.167 --> 12:45.876
WHAT TO DO.

12:47.876 --> 12:51.250
CAN I HELP YOU...

12:47.876 --> 12:51.250
COMMA SIR?

12:51.292 --> 12:54.042
QUESTION MARK.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.959
YES, MY 30-YEAR-OLD BROTHER

12:54.083 --> 12:56.959
WOULD LIKE TO BUY

12:57.000 --> 13:00.042
"UNBRIDLED MAYHEM," PLEASE.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.959
YOU'RE STILL

13:00.083 --> 13:01.959
HOLDING MY HAND!

13:12.292 --> 13:15.125
PHILLIP, CAN I

13:12.292 --> 13:15.125
TALK TO YOU ABOUT

13:12.292 --> 13:15.125
SOMETHING PERSONAL?

13:15.167 --> 13:16.918
NO.

13:16.959 --> 13:19.584
THANKS.

13:19.626 --> 13:22.250
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

13:19.626 --> 13:22.250
A WAY TO GET ALAN AND HORACE

13:22.292 --> 13:24.751
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER

13:22.292 --> 13:24.751
AND STOP TALKING TO ME.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.042
WAIT.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.042
HORACE IS IN THE REC ROOM.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.792
MAYBE IF I CAN GET

13:28.083 --> 13:30.792
ALAN IN THERE,

13:30.834 --> 13:32.918
AND THEN SCARE ALAN,

13:30.834 --> 13:32.918
HORACE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS,

13:32.959 --> 13:35.042
THAT WILL BREAK THE ICE,

13:32.959 --> 13:35.042
AND THEN THEY'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.584
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:36.626 --> 13:41.042
I DON'T KNOW WHO HORACE,

13:36.626 --> 13:41.042
ALAN OR YOU ARE.

13:41.083 --> 13:44.042
I JUST STARTED WORKING HERE,

13:41.083 --> 13:44.042
AND I ALREADY REGRET IT.

13:46.876 --> 13:50.834
ALAN! I NEED YOU TO GO TO

13:46.876 --> 13:50.834
THE REC ROOM RIGHT AWAY.

13:50.876 --> 13:54.918
CAN'T IT WAIT?

13:50.876 --> 13:54.918
I'M VERY BUSY RIGHT NOW

13:50.876 --> 13:54.918
NOT BEING IN THE REC ROOM.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.292
BUT IT'S URGENT.

13:57.334 --> 13:59.334
THERE'S A LEAK IN THERE.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.959
SO CALL THE JANITOR.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I CAN'T BECAUSE...

14:03.042 --> 14:07.042
IT'S THE JANITOR

14:03.042 --> 14:07.042
WHO'S LEAKING.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.042
BODILY FLUIDS...

14:09.083 --> 14:10.792
EVERYWHERE.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.042
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

14:10.834 --> 14:12.042
WHO CAN SAVE HIM.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.792
WOW! FINALLY, EVERYONE

14:12.083 --> 14:15.792
WILL KNOW THAT ALAN DIAZ

14:15.834 --> 14:18.667
IS HEROIC AND BRAVE

14:15.834 --> 14:18.667
AND... ( shrieks )

14:24.792 --> 14:27.042
THAT LOOKS PAINFUL.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.792
YES.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.584
AND THESE ARE JUST

14:28.834 --> 14:31.584
THE NEEDLES YOU CAN SEE.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.250
MAN, I LOVE HAVING

14:36.083 --> 14:39.250
A 30-YEAR-OLD BEST FRIEND.

14:39.292 --> 14:42.834
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH

14:39.292 --> 14:42.834
TO RENT AN INDUSTRIAL VACUUM.

14:42.876 --> 14:44.709
AND YOU CAN

14:42.876 --> 14:44.709
DRIVE ME ANYWHERE,

14:44.751 --> 14:47.792
LIKE, TO THE INDUSTRIAL

14:44.751 --> 14:47.792
VACUUM RENTAL STORE.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.125
BRAIN MATTER'S POWER MADE ME

14:47.834 --> 14:50.125
15 YEARS OLDER.

14:50.167 --> 14:52.334
IT DIDN'T MAGICALLY

14:50.167 --> 14:52.334
GIVE ME A CAR.

14:52.375 --> 14:55.709
SO YOU'RE 30 YEARS OLD

14:52.375 --> 14:55.709
AND YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR OWN CAR?

14:55.751 --> 14:57.250
THAT'S PATHETIC.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.918
COME ON, OLIVER,

15:01.083 --> 15:03.918
CHILL OUT.

15:03.959 --> 15:06.667
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE

15:03.959 --> 15:06.667
A CRANKY OLD MAN.

15:08.918 --> 15:10.083
UM, DUDE?

15:13.459 --> 15:15.417
I'VE TURNED INTO

15:13.459 --> 15:15.417
MY FATHER.

15:15.459 --> 15:17.250
LITERALLY.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.000
MY GUT, MY HAIRLINE,

15:17.292 --> 15:20.000
MY DESIRE TO DANCE LIKE THIS.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.334
BRAIN MATTER'S AGING POWER

15:22.959 --> 15:25.334
STILL MUST BE AFFECTING YOU.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.751
BUT DON'T PANIC,

15:25.375 --> 15:27.751
BECAUSE THE WAY I FIGURE IT,

15:27.792 --> 15:30.417
AT THIS RATE, IN ABOUT

15:27.792 --> 15:30.417
AN HOUR, YOU'LL BE...

15:30.459 --> 15:32.167
DEAD YEARS OLD.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.000
OKAY, NOW YOU CAN PANIC.

15:38.417 --> 15:41.459
BRAIN MATTER, CAN I PICK

15:38.417 --> 15:41.459
YOUR BRAIN MATTER ABOUT

15:38.417 --> 15:41.459
SOMETHING PERSONAL?

15:41.500 --> 15:42.918
NO.

15:42.959 --> 15:45.250
THANKS.

15:45.292 --> 15:48.209
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

15:45.292 --> 15:48.209
WHAT SKYLAR SAID ABOUT ME

15:45.292 --> 15:48.209
BEING A FATHER FIGURE FOR ALAN.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.417
BUT I FEEL LIKE

15:48.250 --> 15:50.417
IT'S TOO LATE.

15:50.459 --> 15:53.375
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU,

15:50.459 --> 15:53.375
BUT I'M OVER THERE NOW.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.459
THANKS.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.459
GOOD TALK.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.209
ALAN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.083
I DON'T NEED A MIND READER

15:59.250 --> 16:02.083
TO TELL ME SOMETHING'S

15:59.250 --> 16:02.083
BOTHERING YOU.

16:02.125 --> 16:05.000
FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE

16:02.125 --> 16:05.000
A MIND READER ON STAFF,

16:05.042 --> 16:07.751
AND SHE TOLD ME

16:05.042 --> 16:07.751
SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.751
SO LET'S JUST

16:07.792 --> 16:09.751
SIT OVER HERE,

16:09.792 --> 16:13.042
AND YOU CAN CONFIDE IN ME

16:09.792 --> 16:13.042
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.042
I DON'T CARE

16:13.083 --> 16:15.042
HOW LONG IT TAKES.

16:15.083 --> 16:18.417
THERE'S NOTHING ON MY MIND.

16:18.459 --> 16:20.876
WELL, I GAVE IT

16:18.459 --> 16:20.876
MY BEST SHOT.

16:28.542 --> 16:30.792
BRAIN MATTER, CAN I TALK

16:28.542 --> 16:30.792
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING PERSONAL?

16:30.834 --> 16:32.417
NO.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.334
THANKS.

16:34.375 --> 16:37.417
- IT'S ABOUT HORACE AND ALAN.

16:34.375 --> 16:37.417
- THEY'RE BOTH IN THERE.

16:37.459 --> 16:40.876
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

16:37.459 --> 16:40.876
I'VE GOT 2,200 VOICEMAILS

16:37.459 --> 16:40.876
TO GET TO.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.834
THEY'RE ALL FROM

16:40.918 --> 16:42.834
MY MOTHER.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.542
I JUST NEED A WAY

16:44.959 --> 16:47.542
TO SCARE ALAN.

16:47.584 --> 16:50.334
ALAN, PLEASE.

16:47.584 --> 16:50.334
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

16:50.375 --> 16:53.834
AND I PROMISE,

16:50.375 --> 16:53.834
I'LL ALWAYS SUPPORT

16:50.375 --> 16:53.834
YOU WITHOUT JUDGMENT.

16:55.417 --> 16:57.042
OKAY.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.834
IT'S JUST...

16:58.876 --> 17:00.542
( growling )

17:00.584 --> 17:02.292
( shrieking )

17:03.500 --> 17:04.626
Horace:

17:03.500 --> 17:04.626
OH, THAT STINKS.

17:04.666 --> 17:06.291
THANKS, NIGHTMARE LADY.

17:07.541 --> 17:09.291
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

17:09.334 --> 17:11.250
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.876
A LOT OF PEOPLE

17:11.291 --> 17:14.876
WITH POWERS DEVELOP

17:11.291 --> 17:14.876
NEW ABILITIES AT YOUR AGE.

17:14.917 --> 17:17.041
- THEY DO?

17:14.917 --> 17:17.041
- YES.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.416
IT SEEMS YOU'VE INHERITED

17:17.083 --> 17:19.416
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S POWER

17:19.459 --> 17:21.041
TO MORPH INTO ANIMALS.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.250
ONCE YOU LEARN

17:21.083 --> 17:23.250
TO CONTROL YOUR POWER,

17:23.291 --> 17:24.459
IT'LL BE VERY USEFUL.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
SO I CAN GET A DISCOUNT AT

17:26.541 --> 17:29.042
GO-KART TRACKS WHERE

17:26.541 --> 17:29.042
ANIMALS DRIVE FOR FREE?

17:29.083 --> 17:32.334
I SHOULD TAKE YOU OUT MORE.

17:32.375 --> 17:35.250
ANYWAY, YOU CAN COME TO ME

17:32.375 --> 17:35.250
WITH PROBLEMS ANY TIME.

17:35.292 --> 17:38.042
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU WANT TO

17:35.292 --> 17:38.042
BE THE STRONG, SILENT TYPE,

17:38.083 --> 17:39.500
THAT'S FINE, TOO.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.292
YOU CAN EVEN BE

17:39.542 --> 17:41.292
THE WEAK, SILENT TYPE.

17:41.334 --> 17:44.542
ANY TYPE PLUS SILENCE--

17:41.334 --> 17:44.542
THAT'S THE KEY.

17:47.918 --> 17:50.209
SKYLAR, THANKS FOR

17:47.918 --> 17:50.209
BEING THERE FOR ME.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.375
AND I KNOW I SMELL

17:50.250 --> 17:52.375
PRETTY BAD,

17:52.417 --> 17:55.000
PLUS NOW, THERE'S ALSO

17:52.417 --> 17:55.000
THE SKUNK ODOR.

17:57.125 --> 18:00.417
HORACE, OLIVER IS AGING

17:57.125 --> 18:00.417
UNCONTROLLABLY.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.167
WE'VE GOT LESS THAN AN HOUR

18:04.083 --> 18:06.167
BEFORE WE LOSE HIM.

18:06.209 --> 18:08.042
- WHERE'S BRAIN MATTER?

18:06.209 --> 18:08.042
- AT THE AIRPORT.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.959
HIS CAR'S BEEN IN

18:08.083 --> 18:09.959
LONG-TERM PARKING

18:10.000 --> 18:11.292
THE WHOLE TIME

18:10.000 --> 18:11.292
HE'S BEEN FROZEN.

18:11.334 --> 18:15.000
APPARENTLY, HE OWES

18:11.334 --> 18:15.000
THEM $65,000.

18:15.042 --> 18:17.042
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

18:15.042 --> 18:17.042
TO REVERSE THE AGING PROCESS

18:17.083 --> 18:20.459
FAST BEFORE OLIVER DIES OF

18:17.083 --> 18:20.459
UNNATURAL NATURAL CAUSES.

18:23.042 --> 18:25.500
HE HAS PRETTY MUCH

18:23.042 --> 18:25.500
NO PULSE.

18:25.542 --> 18:29.083
I GUESS THIS IS

18:25.542 --> 18:29.083
THE END, OLIVER.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.209
AT LEAST YOU LIVED

18:29.125 --> 18:31.209
TO A RIPE OLD AGE.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.500
WHAT ARE YOU

18:31.250 --> 18:33.500
TALKING ABOUT?

18:33.542 --> 18:37.042
I LIVED TO 14, AND THEN,

18:33.542 --> 18:37.042
LIKE, ONE MORE DAY.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.542
HORACE, THIS IS

18:37.083 --> 18:39.542
ALL YOUR FAULT.

18:39.584 --> 18:42.042
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE

18:39.584 --> 18:42.042
HAPPENED IF YOU HADN'T

18:39.584 --> 18:42.042
TRIED TO FIX BRAIN MATTER.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.584
YOU CAN'T MAKE AN OMELET

18:42.083 --> 18:44.584
WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW EGGS.

18:44.626 --> 18:46.542
OR A FEW PROMISES.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.959
IF YOU PROMISE SOMEONE

18:46.584 --> 18:48.959
AN OMELET AND DON'T DELIVER IT.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.626
EGGS.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.626
THAT'S IT.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.500
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.500
OLIVER, DO NOT MOVE.

18:54.542 --> 18:58.167
I'M 90.

18:54.542 --> 18:58.167
WHERE AM I GONNA GO?

18:58.209 --> 19:00.459
FLORIDA?

19:03.709 --> 19:06.042
IT'S ALREADY HATCHED.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.167
AH, THE CATERPILLAR EGGS.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.626
OKAY.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.250
I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT,

19:17.667 --> 19:20.250
BUT I THINK EGGS

19:17.667 --> 19:20.250
MIGHT BE THE ANSWER.

19:20.292 --> 19:24.042
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE

19:20.292 --> 19:24.042
GOING WITH THIS.

19:20.292 --> 19:24.042
WE MAKE DENVER OMELETS.

19:24.083 --> 19:27.500
NO, WHEN BRAIN MATTER

19:24.083 --> 19:27.500
HAD THE POWER TO

19:24.083 --> 19:27.500
TURN THINGS YOUNGER,

19:27.542 --> 19:30.042
HE ZAPPED MY CATERPILLARS,

19:27.542 --> 19:30.042
AND THEY TRANSFORMED

19:27.542 --> 19:30.042
INTO THESE.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.584
IF THE EGGS ARE STILL

19:30.083 --> 19:32.584
INFECTED WITH SOME

19:30.083 --> 19:32.584
OF THAT POWER,

19:32.626 --> 19:34.667
THEN EATING THEM WILL

19:32.626 --> 19:34.667
TURN OLIVER YOUNGER.

19:34.709 --> 19:36.125
THAT JUST MIGHT WORK.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.000
BUT IF IT DOESN'T,

19:36.167 --> 19:38.000
THEN DENVER OMELETS?

19:47.667 --> 19:49.709
SOLAR FLARE, CAN YOU

19:47.667 --> 19:49.709
COOK THESE FOR ME?

19:54.334 --> 19:56.542
OLIVER, EAT UP

19:54.334 --> 19:56.542
THESE CHICKEN EGGS

19:56.584 --> 19:58.292
THAT I TOTALLY BOUGHT

19:56.584 --> 19:58.292
AT THE GROCERY STORE.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.083
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE!

20:09.792 --> 20:13.083
BUT YOU DIDN'T

20:09.792 --> 20:13.083
MAKE ME AN OMELET.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.584
IF ANYTHING, YOU MADE ME

20:13.125 --> 20:15.584
A BROKEN PROMISES OMELET.

20:15.626 --> 20:18.584
WHY DID I EVEN TELL YOU

20:15.626 --> 20:18.584
ABOUT THOSE?

20:23.083 --> 20:26.709
KAZ, THANK YOU

20:23.083 --> 20:26.709
FOR SAVING ME.

20:26.751 --> 20:28.542
BUT I DO NOT WANT

20:26.751 --> 20:28.542
TO BE FOUR AGAIN.

20:28.584 --> 20:30.042
YOU NEED TO CHANGE ME.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.709
OKAY, HORACE AND I

20:30.083 --> 20:32.709
WILL WORK ON IT.

20:32.751 --> 20:35.042
NO, I MEAN...

20:35.083 --> 20:37.292
YOU NEED TO CHANGE ME.

20:37.334 --> 20:39.459
I'M NOT POTTY TRAINED.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.042
OKAY, THINK I FOUND

20:44.709 --> 20:46.042
THE SOLUTION.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.626
THIS TANGERINE IS FROM

20:47.667 --> 20:49.626
THE PLANT THAT BRAIN MATTER

20:47.667 --> 20:49.626
GREW FROM A SEEDLING,

20:49.667 --> 20:51.667
SO EATING A BITE SHOULD

20:49.667 --> 20:51.667
BRING YOU BACK TO NORMAL.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.167
- IT WORKED.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.167
- ALL RIGHT, YES!

21:01.209 --> 21:02.792
NOW THAT YOU'RE

21:01.209 --> 21:02.792
BACK TO NORMAL,

21:02.834 --> 21:04.709
WE CAN FOCUS ON

21:02.834 --> 21:04.709
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

21:04.751 --> 21:06.417
TRYING TO ENJOY EVERY DAY

21:04.751 --> 21:06.417
AS WE LIVE IT

21:06.459 --> 21:08.375
INSTEAD OF WISHING

21:06.459 --> 21:08.375
WE WERE OLDER ALL THE TIME?

21:08.417 --> 21:11.417
NO. PLAYING INAPPROPRIATE

21:08.417 --> 21:11.417
NIGHTMARE-INDUCING VIDEO GAMES

21:11.459 --> 21:13.167
LIKE "UNBRIDLED MAYHEM."

21:18.751 --> 21:20.792
OH, HEY, GUYS.

21:18.751 --> 21:20.792
WHAT ARE YOU...

21:20.834 --> 21:23.626
( shrieking )

21:25.334 --> 21:27.292
WHAT WAS THAT?

21:27.334 --> 21:29.375
I'LL TELL YOU

21:27.334 --> 21:29.375
WHAT THAT WAS.

21:29.417 --> 21:31.042
MY NEW BIOLOGY LAB.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.334
HEY, ALAN,

21:32.626 --> 21:35.334
HERE, BOY.
