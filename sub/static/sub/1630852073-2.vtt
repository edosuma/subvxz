00:00.800 --> 00:03.268
<i>Previously on
the 1000-lb Sisters...</i>

00:12.278 --> 00:14.680
Don't be too much of an
[bleep] to these people.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.216
They hear that
[bleep] you can be rough.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.185
I can be a little
intimidating, I guess,

00:20.187 --> 00:23.522
because of my size
and I got resting bitch face.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.163
We're gonna go
into that slow lunge walk.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.231
Lunges.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.166
I thought
they were saying lunch.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.003
Holy [bleep]
what happened to you?

00:38.005 --> 00:40.406
I had an emergency surgery
on my leg,

00:40.408 --> 00:45.177
which pretty much kept me kind of
bedridden and I gained 40 pounds.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.152
Kaboom!

00:53.653 --> 00:55.421
Bye, bitches.

01:04.564 --> 01:09.334
Yes, I need to call in some
medicine for Tammy Slaton.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.211
Okay, but you see
what I'm doing.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.280
I can't stop and do it.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.182
[grunts]

01:24.184 --> 01:26.118
Stop calling me damn stupid.
I'm tired of it.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.187
Shut [bleep] stupid.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.089
That's it. I'm done.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.623
Okay.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.126
I told her [bleep] three times.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.195
-I'm done.
-You don't [bleep] tell me nothing.

01:52.912 --> 01:54.179
Yeah.

01:54.447 --> 01:58.217
She needs to grow up and take
care of her own medical stuff.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.585
Yeah.

02:00.753 --> 02:02.921
I'm a mom, not her mom.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.090
I just got my head
chewed off by Tammy

02:05.092 --> 02:08.594
because I was trying to
help her get her medication.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.438
Just need my medicine refilled.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.009
I don't know why didn't
y'all get the referral.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.377
[bleep]

02:26.546 --> 02:28.146
[Emily speaking]

02:36.589 --> 02:41.894
You know, she's like, "I got a
baby now. I got a life. I pay my bills."

02:41.896 --> 02:44.596
Bitch, no, no.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.933
Because without Michael you
wouldn't have your bills paid

02:47.935 --> 02:50.135
because he's the one
that takes you to go pay them.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.771
I'm not putting up
with her [bleep] anymore.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.439
This is bull [bleep]

02:56.276 --> 03:01.013
I can't be taking care of Gage and
taking care of Tammy at the same time.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.048
So something's gotta give.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.034
[bleep] yeah,
I don't [bleep] care.

03:31.844 --> 03:35.547
Recently I got approved
for bariatric surgery.

03:35.549 --> 03:41.253
But after seeing Dr. Smith, I had
an emergency surgery on my leg.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.854
I wasn't able to exercise.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.057
Six weeks of sitting
on the couch,

03:45.059 --> 03:47.292
ended up gaining 40 pounds back.

03:49.829 --> 03:50.963
You must be Chris.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.798
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm Matt.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.366
- It's good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

03:55.435 --> 03:58.971
I'm just doing what I can do
to make sure I burn calories.

03:58.973 --> 03:59.972
Okay, good deal.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.741
We'll see if we can
help you with that.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.078
I've struggled with weight pretty
much since I was 13 years old.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.114
About a year ago
I was 482 pounds

04:09.116 --> 04:12.551
and I was diagnosed
with type 1 diabetes.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.886
I've done come way too far.

04:14.888 --> 04:18.857
So I'm not about to mess it up
now being so close to getting it.

04:18.859 --> 04:22.127
We're going to do
a little farm boy fitness.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.930
I got to lose as much weight as
possible before I go see the doctor.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.967
So I figured it'd be a good jump
start doing this crossfitness crap,

04:28.969 --> 04:30.769
whatever everybody's
talking about.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.273
He brought me out to a farm
surrounded by corn fields

04:34.275 --> 04:36.875
and it's just a bunch
[bleep] out here, you know,

04:36.877 --> 04:42.080
old tire, sledge hammer, couple
bales of hay, chains, a big ass rope.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.017
I'm waiting for the children of
the corn to come out and kill me.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.287
Take this PVC here

04:48.289 --> 04:50.789
and we're just gonna see what
your mobility is like, all right.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.058
You want to feel a good
stretch with it.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.894
We're going to try to keep
our whole hand around it.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.162
Oh, well, I ain't doing that.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.096
No, no, no.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.865
There goes the hat.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.401
It's hillbilly,
CrossFit is what he said.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.803
You ever done a workout
like this?

05:04.805 --> 05:05.837
No, no.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.206
- I don't even know what I've got into.
- Okay.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.111
So why don't you tell me a
little bit about your family?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.180
Your family history.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.583
- Any exercisers in the family?
- No.

05:19.752 --> 05:20.986
No.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.489
Chris got some weight to lose.
He's gonna have to work hard.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.260
He's gonna have to stay disciplined
to be able to get the weight off.

05:28.262 --> 05:30.896
So I'm going to take him through
a circuit of functional fitness,

05:30.898 --> 05:32.864
things people do
in everyday life.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.700
All right, so the first thing
we're gonna do,

05:34.702 --> 05:36.468
some swings
of this sledgehammer.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.503
I ain't got no choice.
I gotta lose this weight.

05:38.505 --> 05:43.909
So the big deal is, is just put in
as much effort as you can and try.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.978
I don't want to fail just because
I didn't want to put in the work.

05:48.147 --> 05:49.748
There you go.

06:01.961 --> 06:07.866
So, there's times on the farm you got to
swing a hammer, bust wood, pack corn.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.970
But unless it's making money,
I don't want to do it for free.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.341
We got some 40-pound feed sacks.

06:17.877 --> 06:23.115
You take it, throw it
over your shoulder like this.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.592
There you go.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.926
[Chris breathing heavily]

06:34.928 --> 06:37.295
Chris needs to work hard
to lose the weight.

06:37.297 --> 06:40.599
Sometimes it's easier
to just keep the status quo

06:40.601 --> 06:42.868
and keep the weight on
because that's what you're used to.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.370
I want to drive home to him
how good it will feel

06:45.372 --> 06:47.305
when he gets off the weight
that he has now.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.341
Just like it's that tire.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.057
I mean, seriously [bleep]

07:06.059 --> 07:08.126
Don't nobody like to exercise.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.229
And if they do,
they're already skinny.

07:11.231 --> 07:14.966
How you feeling? Feel
like getting back to work?

07:14.968 --> 07:17.836
- I feel like I am working.
- Yeah.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.838
You know,
because of my health problems,

07:19.840 --> 07:26.378
the urgency to get the surgery
is life or death.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.481
All right, it's time
to find a chair.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.350
I'm finding a chair. Sorry.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.087
Right now I know
that I need to lose weight.

07:36.089 --> 07:40.559
And if not, I'm really worried
that Dr. Smith will say,

07:40.561 --> 07:43.595
"No, you're a backslider,
you're not a candidate no more."

08:10.223 --> 08:14.226
I made a big decision
regarding Tammy...

08:28.908 --> 08:30.742
How does everybody
eat their steak?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.177
- Well done.
- Rare.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.178
- Rare.
- I know you're burnt.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.346
You're raw.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.248
- Really, really done.
- Rare.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.117
What's up?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.218
Not a lot.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.087
How is your weight loss?

08:42.089 --> 08:45.557
Well, I mean I'm not
where I need to be.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.859
You know, it's just like being
normal fat people, you know,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.694
you can lose some weight,
you gain some weight back

08:49.696 --> 08:51.329
and then you got to go back
on [bleep]

08:51.331 --> 08:54.266
You know, the biggest thing
is just staying on track.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.202
Me, you, Tammy, all of us.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.673
Misty, ain't gonna hurt her
to lose a damn pound either.

09:01.675 --> 09:05.243
So what all did you like
and dislike about rehab?

09:10.816 --> 09:14.452
- They didn't have nothing that you liked?
- No.

09:14.454 --> 09:17.489
What were they serving
that you didn't like?

09:19.025 --> 09:21.026
Corn.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.861
Anything that wasn't real food.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.030
It just didn't have flavor.

09:27.199 --> 09:30.902
What is the plan
to lose the weight?

09:30.904 --> 09:34.239
I gave up a lot
of the carbs and the sweets.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.182
Tammy left rehab early

09:44.184 --> 09:46.818
but now she's annoyed
everybody's giving her a lecture.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.421
But we only want
the best for you.

09:49.423 --> 09:54.092
You enter this rehab on your
own connec... continenses...

10:03.202 --> 10:05.437
Y'all just need to give me
some more credit

10:05.439 --> 10:08.239
and give me a little more faith.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.141
Faith?

10:10.843 --> 10:12.243
Ain't none of us here walked
on water,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.312
so, you know,
we ain't got a lot.

10:31.397 --> 10:32.831
Don't I seem different?

10:32.898 --> 10:38.036
Okay, but you was in a controlled
environment for the last seven weeks.

10:38.038 --> 10:42.540
Just do what I can to keep stuff I'm
not supposed to have out of my house.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.548
How [bleep] can have it?

10:56.589 --> 11:00.625
[Chris] The tension that Tammy and
Amy got is a love-hate relationship.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.794
They don't know how to act.

11:02.796 --> 11:07.232
Tammy, when she asks for
something, she wants it done now.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.336
And is inconsiderate of what
Amy's really got going on,

11:11.338 --> 11:13.071
she just wants what she wants.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.109
Well, I can't go over to your
house all the time like I was.

11:18.111 --> 11:22.514
It's just not possible with Gage
and everything I got going on.

11:26.052 --> 11:29.354
So, I think a home health
nurse would be the best option.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.198
What the [bleep]

11:50.509 --> 11:51.910
I think it's a great idea,

11:52.044 --> 11:55.013
somebody to come in and help
her, you know, meal prep or whatever.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.949
You know, I think getting
somebody to help her take her places,

11:57.951 --> 11:59.884
so she can get some
exercise again and move...

11:59.886 --> 12:01.786
And get out, move around,
be more mobile.

12:01.788 --> 12:05.090
Yeah, you know, being... getting
out of the house, not being cooped up.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.060
[Tammy] My family acts
like I'm invisible.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.996
They treat me
like a doggone animal.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.977
There's no [bleep] way.

12:25.979 --> 12:30.048
Tammy, we are here to
support you any way possible...

12:31.150 --> 12:35.053
but at the same token we
ain't taking no bull [bleep]

12:35.055 --> 12:37.122
I agree.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.825
I've been taking care
of Tammy three years,

12:40.827 --> 12:44.195
but now I need
to be there with my son.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.997
I have a family.

12:45.999 --> 12:52.203
You're a part of that family,
but yet he needs me more.

12:52.205 --> 12:57.041
I decided next week we'll be
interviewing home health nurses.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.743
You dumb-ass.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.513
You're fixin' to
made me mad, Amy. Stop.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.985
Nobody said this was over.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.053
It is for me, bitch.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.992
God.

13:16.595 --> 13:20.565
Tammy thinks I should do everything
for her without a simple thank you.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.168
She takes people for granted.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.270
And I'm done.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.577
Hold up.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.546
- It said I weighed F.
- F?

13:37.216 --> 13:38.883
F for what?

13:38.885 --> 13:40.485
[bleep] fat ass.

13:42.321 --> 13:47.926
Hey, y'all, Amy has decided to
get me a [bleep] healthcare nurse.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.961
Come on, little doodle.

14:30.603 --> 14:35.073
So I decided to blow off some
steam and do a YouTube video.

14:37.142 --> 14:42.981
Hey, y'all. Amy has decided to
get me a [bleep] healthcare nurse.

14:47.519 --> 14:50.889
And if she does,
she got to bitch about it.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.392
So basically I had no choice to
agree to having this nurse come.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.027
So if she's coming,

14:56.029 --> 15:01.232
then I'm having to do more than what
Amy and Chris and them expect her to do.

15:01.234 --> 15:08.039
Like, maybe go to the movies, go
swimming or take me to get my nails done.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.575
And that's what [bleep]
Amy won't do.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.600
Come on, little doodle.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.312
Just [bleep] leave.
I'm trying to do this.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.693
They could have waited
five [bleep] minutes

16:01.695 --> 16:04.462
for me to finish this
to go get food.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.333
Five more minutes wasn't gonna
[bleep] kill them.

16:21.780 --> 16:25.049
Sometimes it feels like
she doesn't realize

16:25.051 --> 16:29.520
that I still have feelings
and I am super emotional.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.078
- Hey, old fogey.
- Hey.

17:02.221 --> 17:05.023
And it's the right thing
to do. You help family.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.960
But I'm a mother to Gage,
not Tammy.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.161
I can't go on like this.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.296
How's the baby?

17:12.298 --> 17:15.400
He's good. He's at... he's
at his granny's right now.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.202
So today I'm at Misty's house

17:18.204 --> 17:23.441
and we are gonna be writing a "Help
Wanted" sign for a home health nurse.

17:30.115 --> 17:33.084
I agree with that as long
as we can get the nurse

17:33.086 --> 17:36.587
to make her do things on
her own, not do it for her.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.889
Yeah.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.592
I brought my iPad
so I can make a...

17:41.594 --> 17:43.628
- Advertisement for it?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.730
I'm having Misty help me

17:45.732 --> 17:49.267
because Misty has more
experience dealing with medical stuff.

17:49.269 --> 17:53.638
She takes care
of three autistic boys.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.008
And I don't always know
what to say.

18:00.345 --> 18:04.582
Help wanted, seeking
a home health care nurse.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.983
Mm-hm.

18:05.985 --> 18:10.021
Must be dependable.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.157
Help patient
be more independent.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.593
Get her mobile, make her walk.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.361
Must enjoy challenges.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.497
I know you ain't talking
about our sister.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.168
Hiring the right person,
it's gonna be hard

18:24.170 --> 18:28.573
because Tammy's hard-headed
and she will bite your head off.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.142
She's like a [bleep]
black widow,

18:31.144 --> 18:33.544
praying mantis, something.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.351
Must have high tolerance
for passing gas

18:42.187 --> 18:44.021
and patience of a saint.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.156
Right.

18:45.158 --> 18:48.759
- High tolerance for
bull [bleep] - Yeah.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.461
Must have balls of steel.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.131
Writing this ad is hard as hell.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.234
I don't want to lie
about how Tammy is,

18:56.236 --> 19:00.071
but I'm afraid if I tell the
truth about how she really is,

19:00.073 --> 19:02.106
nobody will show up.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.008
We're probably
scaring them away.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.143
Let's try to be nice.

19:05.145 --> 19:09.981
Patient is very happy-go-lucky.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.184
Wakes up chipper.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.218
Chipper.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.454
Gets along with everybody.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.058
I think we got it.

19:21.060 --> 19:25.963
So if it doesn't work out, the
next place is assisted living, period.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.798
Where the state takes over
for her

19:27.800 --> 19:31.903
and she has to friggin' do
what the rules are.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.271
That's the only option left.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.119
But I'm the last member.

19:48.121 --> 19:51.389
What are you going to do
when you burned every bridge?

19:53.091 --> 19:55.960
Because my bridge is
getting pretty toasty right now.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.496
I see the ash.

20:13.178 --> 20:16.380
- You dating anybody?
- Yeah.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.616
Tammy does not have the best
track record

20:19.051 --> 20:23.254
when it comes to finding guys that would
actually help her with her weight loss journey.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.390
You say you got this
but at the end--

20:39.571 --> 20:41.572
Today, I'm coming over
to visit Tammy

20:41.574 --> 20:44.942
and I'm happy and relieved

20:44.944 --> 20:51.449
that Tammy's finally realized that she
needs an in-home certified nurse's aide.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.051
But until they can
find somebody,

20:54.053 --> 20:57.255
I'm afraid on her own
Tammy's gonna put on weight.

20:58.357 --> 20:59.357
[knock on door]

20:59.359 --> 21:00.958
Come in.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.328
What's going on, Tammy?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.082
How's the diet going?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.287
Is it?

21:39.598 --> 21:43.567
Veggies, salad, fresh fruit.

21:43.569 --> 21:47.571
Lately all I'm gonna eat
is fruit and meat and cheese.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.307
Fruit's good for you
but you got to watch it

21:49.309 --> 21:50.708
because it has natural
sugar in it.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.742
All right.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.211
Can Chris just be happy for me?

21:54.213 --> 21:57.048
Once again he starts
lecturing me.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.683
About fruit?

21:58.685 --> 21:59.884
It's [bleep] fruit.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.353
Hell, it could have been
fruit dipped in chocolate.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.192
Because this is the best seat
in the house.

22:09.261 --> 22:12.096
Well, I say we weigh in
today, both of us.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.067
If you maintain or lose weight,

22:16.069 --> 22:19.437
we'll take you out to your
favorite Mexican restaurant.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.179
Well, I don't know.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.314
Or get the hot wax.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.952
I ain't doing no action, no.
Negative.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.687
Hell no.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.356
We can wax his back.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.562
- You know what, that ain't even funny.
- Yeah, it is.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.368
Let's get down
to the nitty-gritty

22:50.370 --> 22:52.403
and go talk
to this dirty machine.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.438
She's mean, ain't she?

22:54.440 --> 22:57.975
I know, yeah, just by telling
the God's honest truth.

23:05.817 --> 23:07.151
Oh, hold up.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.521
It said I weighed F.

23:13.825 --> 23:17.828
When Chris first stepped
on the scale, it's read F.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.896
F for what?

23:18.898 --> 23:21.132
[bleep] fat ass.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.509
[Tammy]
What was that all that about?

23:32.677 --> 23:34.445
Well, you figure.

23:34.447 --> 23:37.314
If it won't shut off,
take the batteries out.

23:40.485 --> 23:41.652
Here we go.

23:41.719 --> 23:45.055
You know, this is the worst
part of the day right here.

23:46.892 --> 23:50.561
The last time I weighed in
at Dr. Smith's, I was 380.

23:50.563 --> 23:54.331
And then I had
emergency surgery on my leg...

23:54.333 --> 23:58.969
and six or seven weeks of
healing I gained 40 pounds...

23:59.571 --> 24:01.839
so I was back to 420.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.975
But I started exercising
and walking and stuff,

24:04.977 --> 24:08.279
so I imagine I'm back on track
for losing the weight.

24:19.257 --> 24:23.928
Well, according to your scale
I've gained 10 pounds.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.263
I weighed yesterday
and I was 402.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.866
I don't really believe
I gained 10 pounds.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.201
I'm wearing jeans today,

24:30.203 --> 24:32.436
and when I weighed in
I wore shorts

24:32.438 --> 24:33.604
and I wear cotton shorts.

24:33.606 --> 24:36.240
You know, they might weigh
a pound versus

24:36.242 --> 24:40.311
the blue jeans are about seven
or eight pounds for a pair.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.581
Fat man clothes
do weigh a little bit more.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.117
Shut up.

24:52.190 --> 24:57.194
Oh, my clothes were this one
and this, and that and this and that.

25:07.973 --> 25:11.175
Now it's your turn to come over
and talk to this dirty machine.

25:21.253 --> 25:27.558
[Tammy speaking]

25:57.889 --> 25:59.290
So that means...

26:02.127 --> 26:05.496
you was eight pounds down.
That's wonderful, Tammy.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.766
I get to go to dinner.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.334
You get to go get some Mexican.

26:10.336 --> 26:14.471
Oh, that's, you know,
that's... that's good weight loss.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.881
I'm really proud of you
and one hell of a job

26:23.883 --> 26:27.418
considering, you know, you've
been home with all the temptation.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.088
I'm sitting here like,
what the hell?

26:31.790 --> 26:34.291
She lost it and I gained it.

26:38.029 --> 26:41.265
I'm kind of worried because
Tammy and I have a follow-up

26:41.267 --> 26:43.701
doctor's appointment
with Dr. Smith.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.669
I either make back
the target weight

26:45.671 --> 26:47.938
or there's a damn
good possibility

26:47.940 --> 26:50.307
that he's not gonna let me
have my surgery.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.554
[Tammy and Amy talking]

27:04.956 --> 27:06.090
Okay.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.459
That's why I'm taking
both of them.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.564
Tammy finally agreed with me
to get a home health nurse.

27:13.566 --> 27:16.700
So today me and Tammy
are interviewing candidates,

27:16.702 --> 27:21.138
but we haven't really talked about what
our needs are for the home health nurse.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.440
So I'm not sure
how this is gonna go.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.126
No.

27:50.268 --> 27:53.404
Our problems never get solved.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.476
- No.
- No.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.748
What's your credentials?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.650
- My credentials?
- Yeah, your credentials.

28:06.652 --> 28:10.054
What does she mostly need
to be doing?

28:23.134 --> 28:27.271
But also we want to make sure that
they have your best interests at heart.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.022
But I've done good
for the past week.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.590
But you will have to...

28:46.592 --> 28:48.559
Don't hold me back in the past.

28:49.594 --> 28:51.695
I'm trying to move forward.

28:51.697 --> 28:54.031
Let me continue being good.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.967
And stop holding me down
for the past.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.281
You see I'm making changes.

29:11.283 --> 29:14.284
Why can't you just...
Stop holding me down.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.888
But I've also known you
for 35 years.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.356
I'm 34, bitch.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.391
34 years, whatever.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.335
Like that [bleep] right there,
loaded with sugar.

29:33.004 --> 29:35.239
Don't worry about me.

29:35.241 --> 29:39.009
Amy should have lost a lot
more weight since her surgery.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.245
Her excuse when she
was pregnant with Gage

29:41.247 --> 29:42.946
if she's feeding two.

29:42.948 --> 29:46.016
But Gage is almost
seven months old.

29:46.018 --> 29:50.220
She still isn't eating
what she should be.

30:08.339 --> 30:10.107
How are we gonna do
these interviews

30:10.109 --> 30:12.109
and come
to a conclusion together?

30:12.111 --> 30:14.244
We haven't even started
these interviews

30:14.246 --> 30:16.847
and Tammy's already jumped
in my throat.

30:16.849 --> 30:19.216
But... But nothing.

30:25.123 --> 30:28.091
Did you really eat 32 meals
in two days?

30:29.160 --> 30:32.029
When I came back in,
all the meals were gone.

30:33.064 --> 30:35.732
I might have posted it
on social media.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.167
That was a lot of meals.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.536
You're [bleep] lying though.
Stop that [bleep]

30:42.574 --> 30:44.074
You see I'm making changes.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.910
Why can't you just be happy
with it?

30:46.912 --> 30:47.911
I'm very happy.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.347
Then stop holding me down.

30:50.349 --> 30:54.084
[Amy] Me and Tammy are
interviewing for home care nurses today.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.335
So here's a plan,

31:11.337 --> 31:16.173
we just talk to all of them,
debate, meditate.

31:18.843 --> 31:20.010
Yeah.

31:20.111 --> 31:21.345
I don't know.

31:21.347 --> 31:24.848
But anyway,
make a decision that's mutual.

31:24.850 --> 31:25.716
Yeah.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.385
I'm excited
and I'm hiring a nurse.

31:28.387 --> 31:32.122
I need somebody here
that will be stern with Tammy.

31:37.929 --> 31:39.863
Hey, I'm Tisa.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.765
- Nice to meet you. Amy.
- All right.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.533
- Nice to meet you. I'm Tammy.
- All right, Tammy.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.004
Little Bit, he little to Amy.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.205
So you're okay with dogs, right?

31:48.207 --> 31:49.306
Oh, yeah.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.408
And babies?
I have a six-month-old.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.210
Oh, girl, yeah.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.947
Today we're gonna meet three
potential nurses for Tammy.

31:56.949 --> 31:57.848
You look familiar.

31:57.850 --> 32:02.119
Well, I live in...
I live in Henderson.

32:02.121 --> 32:07.157
[Amy] Only three people got back to
me for my ad about being Tammy's nurse.

32:07.159 --> 32:10.027
They must know how she acts.
People talk.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.030
I'm 22.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.232
I've been taking care of people
since I was like 13 years old.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.334
I don't know anything else.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.136
That's about all I know
how to do.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.137
Oh, this ain't gonna work.

32:20.139 --> 32:24.508
She's too young and too sweet.

32:24.510 --> 32:28.378
Tammy will run all over this
little girl and make her cry.

32:30.548 --> 32:34.217
Have you ever been trying to
clean a man and things happen?

32:34.219 --> 32:36.153
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.832
How do you feel about Amy
farting all the time?

32:48.834 --> 32:50.267
And Tammy burping all the time?

32:50.802 --> 32:53.003
And maybe a little bit
of diarrhea.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.941
Well, you just... I mean, you just
intentionally just walk and poop,

32:57.943 --> 32:59.242
- is that what you're saying?
- No.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.044
- It just comes up sometimes.
- Sometimes.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.279
Oh, it just comes out.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.021
Well, let's not do that.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.259
Of course.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.795
- I'm not wearing no bikini but...
- No, no, no, no.

33:18.797 --> 33:21.131
I'll go swimming with you.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.966
- We can have fun together.
- Totally.

33:22.968 --> 33:27.070
Tammy wants a friend to go to
the movies, get her nails done.

33:27.072 --> 33:31.074
I'm all right with, you know, her
being friendly with them, that's fine,

33:31.076 --> 33:34.911
but I'm paying for a caregiver

33:34.913 --> 33:39.049
and somebody to help her
get more independent.

33:39.051 --> 33:41.985
Is there anything
that you won't do

33:41.987 --> 33:44.221
that's like completely
off the table?

33:44.956 --> 33:48.258
I'm 53, nothing bothers me.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.227
I do just about everything.

33:53.998 --> 33:54.898
I don't think so.

33:54.900 --> 33:58.368
Well, but you said anything.

33:58.370 --> 34:02.472
Like, when she don't get her
way sometimes, she can be a bitch.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.542
Well, that's okay as long as you can
stand somebody to be blunt with you.

34:20.191 --> 34:21.892
I got you. I got you.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.527
So can I ask you
another question?

34:23.529 --> 34:26.496
Did you really eat 32 meals
in two days?

34:32.904 --> 34:36.139
-You're [bleep] lying though.
Stop that [bleep] -I'm not lying.

34:36.141 --> 34:39.342
You're fixin'
to make me mad, Amy, stop.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.244
You're [bleep] lying.

34:41.246 --> 34:46.083
Tammy actually was having this
meal delivery service there for a while

34:46.085 --> 34:48.952
to control her portions.

34:48.954 --> 34:52.823
And I guess it was my bad I
left the meals over at her house.

34:52.825 --> 34:54.191
That was on a Friday.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.159
When I came back in on a Monday,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.273
For two days.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.308
Unless they're small meals.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.076
There's no [bleep] way.

35:17.181 --> 35:19.116
It's complete bull [bleep]

35:26.557 --> 35:28.091
Thank you so much for coming.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.025
It's been a pleasure
meeting you.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.327
Well, it's been a pleasure.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.230
Thank you for your time
and you'll have a great day.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.965
Nice meeting you.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.933
- We'll give you a call.
- Okay.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.401
And I hope you have a nice day.

35:47.712 --> 35:48.979
At the end of the day,

35:48.981 --> 35:52.582
we want two different things
for the home health nurse.

36:03.361 --> 36:08.098
The nurse could keep Tammy on the right
track and give me time with my family.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.933
I need this to work.

36:12.803 --> 36:14.938
I don't want your heart
hurt again.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.840
Just take your time,
get to know him really well.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.108
I got this.

36:18.110 --> 36:19.976
[Emily] I am a little worried,

36:19.978 --> 36:23.880
because her ex Jerry did
not want her to lose the weight.

36:23.882 --> 36:27.384
He brought home food
that he knows she didn't need.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.219
What you doing, girl?

37:03.754 --> 37:05.255
Nothing.

37:05.257 --> 37:08.391
[Tammy] Emily is my niece.
Chris's daughter.

37:15.132 --> 37:16.166
Excuse me.

37:22.106 --> 37:23.540
Why are you staring at me?

37:26.844 --> 37:28.044
What?

37:29.914 --> 37:32.015
I'm dating a female.

37:38.322 --> 37:41.191
I don't have to ask you to date
somebody, I'm 18, sweetheart.

37:41.193 --> 37:42.525
Yeah, now.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.561
But you wasn't when you met her.

37:46.297 --> 37:49.566
The way I define myself
about my sexuality is bisexual.

37:50.568 --> 37:52.636
Tammy helped me by telling me

37:52.638 --> 37:55.138
that you can't change
who you are,

37:55.140 --> 37:58.041
you can't change who you love
and who you want to be with.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.176
Just don't get stuck in
the wrong [bleep] that's all.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.579
That's all I can say.

38:04.282 --> 38:08.118
She's sweet, she's kind, she treated
me better than anybody else has.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.314
She does everything for me.

38:43.788 --> 38:47.957
If she's making any
sandwiches, girl, I need lessons.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.161
Teach me
instead of me teach you.

38:53.230 --> 38:55.165
You dating anybody?

38:58.936 --> 39:00.537
Big maybe or little maybe?

39:02.039 --> 39:04.407
Medium maybe, okay.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.978
Are you talking to a guy
or a girl or a who?

39:10.081 --> 39:12.349
A who. Do you like this who?

39:12.351 --> 39:14.050
Yeah.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.252
He's a who bear.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.421
It's a what's a who bear.

39:26.230 --> 39:29.265
That's not
what I'm talking about.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.380
Misty said that you
fall in love too fast.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.383
It's true, but I mean...

39:56.260 --> 39:58.294
Like, I've seen what you went
through when he left

39:58.296 --> 40:00.330
and I don't want that
to happen again.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.401
I don't want to see that
side of Tammy again.

40:04.835 --> 40:06.336
I lost myself.

40:06.338 --> 40:08.605
I know you did.
That's what I'm talking about.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.241
I am a little worried.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.009
Tammy does not have
the best track record

40:13.011 --> 40:17.947
when it comes to finding guys that would
actually help her with her weight loss journey.

40:17.949 --> 40:23.286
Her ex Jerry did not want her to lose
the weight because Jerry was into BBWs.

40:23.288 --> 40:26.256
BBW means big beautiful women.

40:26.258 --> 40:30.059
He brought home food
that he knows she didn't need.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.328
I don't want your heart
hurt again.

40:32.330 --> 40:34.864
Just take your time,
get to know him really well.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.933
We're taking our time.

40:38.068 --> 40:40.336
You got... you say you
got this, but at the end--

41:08.098 --> 41:12.101
<i>[Amy] Next time
on 1000-lb Sisters...</i>

41:12.103 --> 41:14.304
This is my first Mother's Day
as a mom.

41:14.306 --> 41:17.073
So today we're gonna have
an afternoon tea.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.575
We're getting ice.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.176
We don't really care
for hot tea.

41:22.112 --> 41:24.247
One of my greats,

41:24.249 --> 41:28.251
I don't know how far,
was the Queen of England.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.055
Excuse me.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.156
[knock on door]

41:33.158 --> 41:34.257
Come in.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.893
Today's the nurse's
first day on the job.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.495
It's supposed to make
our lives easier.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.364
I'm not making [bleep]
hamburger patties.

41:41.366 --> 41:44.567
I'm like, "Damn, she just got here
and you're already a bitch to her."

41:47.972 --> 41:49.839
So I always do this in the tub.

41:49.841 --> 41:50.840
This is kind of gross.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.075
What did you just do?

41:52.077 --> 41:54.043
That's expressing anal glands.

41:55.079 --> 41:57.247
Do we have a gland there too?

41:58.015 --> 42:00.783
That's a serious question.

42:00.785 --> 42:06.089
He only associates with women
who weigh 300 plus pounds.

42:06.091 --> 42:09.158
He don't like Tammy.
He's got a fetish.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.994
We just don't want it to turn
into another Jerry...

42:10.996 --> 42:12.829
It's not. He's not Jerry.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.330
Step on that [bleep] scale
and show--

42:14.332 --> 42:15.932
I'm not gonna do it.
