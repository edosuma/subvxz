10:53.653 --> 10:56.781
Ooh, I have to meet the parents
of my kindergartners.

10:56.864 --> 11:02.620
Oh, you have a wonderful father.
Just like his father before him.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.540
[rock music playing]

11:06.624 --> 11:08.250
[indistinct chatter]

11:08.334 --> 11:11.712
Uppers, downers, sunnies, moonies,
airplane glue?

11:11.796 --> 11:14.590
[chuckles]
Ol' Vic's keeping it light tonight.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.759
Just give me some decaf
and three eight-balls.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.094
I don't want to miss anything.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.721
Slick Vic with the giant dick!

11:20.805 --> 11:23.432
Howlin' Hank with the crooked crank!

11:23.516 --> 11:27.687
You were the best dude
at that radio station, man.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.730
Did you know that, after they fired me,
you're the only reason

11:29.814 --> 11:32.817
I didn't go down there with an Uzi
and shoot everybody in the face?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.735
I had a feeling.

11:34.819 --> 11:40.032
Well, I brought a special birthday gift
to make all that pain go away.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.576
Hey, hey, I'll bump to that!

11:42.660 --> 11:43.536
[snorts]

11:44.578 --> 11:46.914
It's Mr. Rosenthal from the station!

11:47.498 --> 11:48.541
[snorts]

11:48.624 --> 11:51.752
Mr. Rosenthal, did you come here
to fire me from my house?

11:51.836 --> 11:56.215
Quite the contrary. I realized I made
a mistake in letting you go.

11:56.298 --> 11:59.051
The Kwock needs you,
and I want to bring you back.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.636
Oh, man, you mean it?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.389
Is my prostate the size of a basketball?

12:03.472 --> 12:07.685
That's a little joke about my impending,
serious medical procedure.

12:07.768 --> 12:11.731
Happy birthday, Vic.
And welcome back, my rock cohort.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.941
[Vic] It's a contract!

12:14.024 --> 12:17.737
And a condom.
I know you're a fan of fornication.

12:17.820 --> 12:21.031
Hey, back door, front door,
as long as I get in the kitchen, baby.

12:21.115 --> 12:24.118
I'll see you at the station
a week from Monday.

12:24.201 --> 12:28.748
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to tell my son that I ran over his cat.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.753
Hey, hey! Vic just got his job back!

12:33.836 --> 12:37.715
I have purpose! I have meaning!

12:37.798 --> 12:41.969
I have a hollowed-out TV filled
with cocaine and barbiturates!

12:42.052 --> 12:43.095
[all cheer]

12:43.179 --> 12:45.431
-Skeeball, toad me!
-Yeah!

12:45.514 --> 12:46.348
[all cheer]

12:46.432 --> 12:49.894
Mrs. Murphy, thank you
for volunteering to help me

12:49.977 --> 12:52.897
with my back-to-school pep talk tonight.

12:52.980 --> 12:56.734
And for hoisting my lifeless legs
up the stairs and onto the stage.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.362
It's my honor, you poor, poor man.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.782
Oh, please, I don't want pity.

13:03.282 --> 13:07.411
I knew what I was doing when I backflipped
off that balcony at the draft board

13:07.495 --> 13:11.332
to prove I was too crazy
to serve in the Army.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.000
But it worked.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.879
Now, stairs are my Vietnam.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.965
Let's mold some young minds.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.511
Of course, and I'd like to speak to you
about my son, Kevin.

13:23.594 --> 13:24.887
He'll be here in a minute too.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.640
He is the perfect candidate
to fill that last slot in--

13:27.723 --> 13:29.683
I'd be honored to help you as well.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.102
And I wonder if I could talk to you
about getting Greg Jr.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.729
into that Dim Lights program.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.773
Oh, fuck me.

13:35.856 --> 13:39.068
He's had a rough year, but we're
getting through it together, right, pal?

13:39.151 --> 13:44.323
"If a man lies with a man as with a woman,
they shall surely be put to death."

13:44.406 --> 13:46.492
Leviticus 20:13.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.871
[chuckles nervously]

13:51.831 --> 13:52.832
Teens.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.042
Why won't my mom get off my back?

13:55.543 --> 13:57.878
My dad's all over me too.

13:57.962 --> 14:02.132
He says a 1550 SAT
might as well be a zero.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.387
"Stanford's for quitters." [groans]

14:06.470 --> 14:09.014
My mom might lose her foot. [swallows]

14:09.431 --> 14:12.351
My mom's been hormonal
ever since she got pregnant again.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.895
[chuckles] She still fucks your dad.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.146
No, she doesn't!

14:16.230 --> 14:17.815
-Bone, flip, bone.
-[laughs]

14:17.898 --> 14:19.859
Holy shit, she does!

14:19.942 --> 14:22.736
Oh, my God,
I need more 'shrooms right now.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.531
Take it easy, Kev.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.869
I don't feel so good. Oh, man. [groans]

14:29.952 --> 14:31.579
It's probably the hobo shit.

14:33.706 --> 14:39.628
In a few years, one of these machines
will cost as little as $12,000

14:39.712 --> 14:42.798
and will be in every white home
in America.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.633
[Mrs. Vanderheim] I have a concern!

14:44.717 --> 14:48.053
My Quincy needs to sit
in the front of the classroom,

14:48.137 --> 14:52.641
and it's not fair you put him in the back
because his name is late in the alphabet.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.228
Mrs. Vanderheim, perhaps we
can discuss this another time?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.355
No, we're doing this now.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.858
I work my jaw off...

15:01.483 --> 15:04.028
at the night library,

15:04.111 --> 15:06.614
so it wasn't easy to get time away,

15:06.697 --> 15:09.700
especially because the J. Geils Band
is in town,

15:09.783 --> 15:13.037
and they love to read.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.663
I hate Amy.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.665
Dad, why does she have to be so mean?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.919
He was proud of me?
The fuck was she talking about?

15:20.377 --> 15:24.381
The carrot, like the war bond,
is the stee-cone--

15:25.049 --> 15:27.176
Keystone of, uh...

15:27.259 --> 15:29.428
Take 23!

15:29.511 --> 15:32.890
[all laughing]

15:32.973 --> 15:38.270
If we could drop a bomb this big
on the Japs, the war would be over!

15:38.354 --> 15:40.064
[all laughing]

15:40.147 --> 15:44.360
Goddamn motherfucker... carrot costume.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.819
Daddy, are you okay?

15:45.903 --> 15:47.821
He's fine, honey.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.073
Give this doctor a call

15:49.156 --> 15:53.077
before the syphilis turns your brain
into pancake batter.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.286
[Sue] Come on.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.498
[Greg] Come on, come on.
Here we go. [grunts]

15:57.581 --> 16:01.418
Careful. Lift with my legs,
not with my back.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.463
Well, some of us
aren't pulling our weight.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.591
And some of us are eight months pregnant.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.511
Now, now, we all have our faults.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.263
[both grunting]

16:13.681 --> 16:16.892
There. [sighs] Thank goodness
I have dancer's legs.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.269
Now, can I tell you about how Greg Jr.--?

16:19.353 --> 16:22.523
Did you know Kevin is
a passionate advocate for pool safety?

16:22.606 --> 16:25.526
Watching all that exertion
has made me thirsty.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.611
I'd love an orange drink.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.696
[both] I'll get it!

16:28.779 --> 16:29.989
Eat my dust, Sue!

16:30.072 --> 16:31.281
-[grunts]
-Ah!

16:31.365 --> 16:32.658
My pungus!

16:33.909 --> 16:36.120
[chuckles] Colder.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.246
Warmer. [chuckles]

16:37.329 --> 16:39.540
[overlapping chatter]

16:40.749 --> 16:43.335
Fuck this Babe Ruth shit. It's the '70s!

16:43.419 --> 16:45.087
-[cocks gun]
-[all scream]

16:45.170 --> 16:47.339
Too hot! Too hot!

16:47.423 --> 16:48.841
[doorbell rings]

16:48.924 --> 16:50.509
Don't run away, Skeeball.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.762
Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Huckerfucker!

16:53.846 --> 16:57.307
Your party is a little noisy.
Would you mind--?

16:57.391 --> 16:59.893
Put your keys in the bowl. [chuckles]

16:59.977 --> 17:03.188
-You're fucking some stranger tonight.
-[sighs] Oh.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.982
[Vic] I said put them in the bowl!

17:05.065 --> 17:06.692
[distorted music playing]

17:06.775 --> 17:09.111
Don't freak out. Deep breaths.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.613
[Nuber] Oh, shit, Kevin Murphy?

17:11.697 --> 17:14.742
-Nuber? Is that really you?
-Fuck yeah!

17:14.825 --> 17:16.035
Are you going here now?

17:16.118 --> 17:18.412
Fuck no! I dropped out.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.581
Got my own place and a sweet job.

17:20.664 --> 17:23.876
You should drop out too.
We'll be work buddies.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.128
-Is there an opening?
-Fuck maybe!

17:26.211 --> 17:27.629
Oh, man, that'd be so--

17:27.713 --> 17:31.216
What the hell you doing?
Get your narrow ass back to work!

17:31.300 --> 17:34.762
Man, can't even enjoy half a joint
without you wandering off.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.639
-Sorry, boss.
-I ain't your boss. I'm your master,

17:37.723 --> 17:41.060
you fish-eyed-banjo-boy-
from-<i>Deliverance-</i>looking motherfucker!

17:41.143 --> 17:42.978
Yes, sir, I do appear inbred, sir.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.355
Hey, you Frank Murphy's kid.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.609
You better not be storing no Necco Wafers
in your cheeks!

17:48.692 --> 17:50.903
I'm rough on Larry
'cause I see his potential.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.404
You give your dad my best.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.907
We got to go fill the tampon machine
over at the slaughterhouse.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.117
Them ladies all
on the same cycle over there.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.579
Hop to it, you drippy-dick,
Bugs-Bunny-looking freak!

18:00.662 --> 18:03.916
Yes, sir, Mr. Greenwood.
I'm so ugly, you're right.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.834
[moaning]

18:06.877 --> 18:12.257
By the end of the year, each of your boys
will have built a beautiful napkin holder.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.719
So don't go out buying napkin holders.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.807
[groans] Fucking Bridget.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.809
Dad, can we go home?

18:22.768 --> 18:24.019
Dad?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.105
That old broad didn't see the walk home.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.606
[big band music playing]

18:28.774 --> 18:31.318
Wonderful play.
Well, good night, Mrs. Breckman.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.071
I got to plant my vegetable here
back in the garden.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.908
There's that delightful Bill Murphy humor.
Night now.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.203
Congratulations, son,
you did a great job tonight.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.330
Oh, uh... thanks.

18:43.413 --> 18:47.876
That's if your mission was to embarrass me
in front of the whole fucking town!

18:47.960 --> 18:50.546
You just dipped my name
in an ocean of shit!

18:50.629 --> 18:52.005
[whimpers]

18:52.089 --> 18:55.467
[mock cries] You're gonna cry now,
are you, you little baby?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.386
William, take it easy on him.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.681
Shut up, Nora!
You are the reason he's soft.

19:00.764 --> 19:01.932
[sobs]

19:02.015 --> 19:06.770
That's it, you're walking home now.
There's no room in DeSotos for sissies!

19:06.854 --> 19:09.731
-I'll make a man out of you yet!
-[horn honks]

19:09.815 --> 19:13.026
Anybody want a daughter?
I thought I had a son!

19:13.110 --> 19:15.529
Dad. Dad, are you all right?

19:15.612 --> 19:17.948
Mind your business. I'm fine!

19:19.032 --> 19:20.576
-Goddamn him!
-[door slams]

19:22.452 --> 19:25.289
Fuck you!

19:25.372 --> 19:31.503
In kindergarten, we learn our ABC's,
but also our p's and q's.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.672
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, lady.

19:33.755 --> 19:36.842
-[all gasp]
-Mr. Murphy said the "fuck" word.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.969
[children] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

19:39.052 --> 19:42.598
You didn't see when my dad called me
a sissy and made me walk home!

19:42.681 --> 19:45.142
Dad, stop yelling at her!
You're embarrassing me!

19:45.225 --> 19:48.729
Grown-ups are talking, sweetheart.
He said I looked like Red Skelton's dick!

19:48.812 --> 19:51.231
You're nothing like your father!

19:52.232 --> 19:54.610
I take that as a huge compliment!

19:54.693 --> 19:56.111
[distorted music playing]

19:57.070 --> 20:00.741
Stay calm.
The walls are supposed to be melting.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.493
-Kevin, what's wrong with you?
-Mom?

20:03.577 --> 20:06.747
I told you to come talk to the principal
with me about your future,

20:06.830 --> 20:10.709
and instead you did mushrooms
from the place where the hobos shit?

20:10.792 --> 20:15.464
[sobbing] Oh, I'm so disappointed in you.

20:15.547 --> 20:20.260
Nice job, Kevin.
Takes a real jagoff to make a trophy cry.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.054
You're a fucking loser.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.723
Counter argument,
you're a huge fucking loser!

20:24.806 --> 20:27.059
You guys are supposed
to disagree with each other!

20:27.142 --> 20:28.644
[both] Not on this topic!

20:28.727 --> 20:31.063
I'm so sorry, Mom.
I'll do better, I swear.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.440
[man] I've heard
that empty promise before.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.442
Huey Long? You're a real person?

20:35.525 --> 20:38.570
You are a disgrace to the school
they named after me.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.531
You're an ignoramus,
a bumbling liquor thief,

20:41.615 --> 20:45.661
and you deserved to jizz your pants
at Haircut Girl's house.

20:45.744 --> 20:46.745
You saw that?

20:46.828 --> 20:48.664
Huey Long sees everything!

20:49.289 --> 20:51.792
You, sir, are a dildo.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.169
-No!
-[all chanting] Kevin dildo!

20:54.253 --> 20:55.629
[rhythmic clapping]

20:55.712 --> 20:58.924
-Kevin dildo!
-[rhythmic clapping]

20:59.007 --> 21:00.509
-Kevin dildo!
-No!

21:00.592 --> 21:01.718
[rhythmic clapping]

21:01.802 --> 21:03.470
[vomits]

21:05.555 --> 21:07.182
Oh, that feels better.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.476
[sighs]

21:09.559 --> 21:11.895
[girl] Nice Shire of Frodo stickers.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.439
I love those guys.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.943
Yeah, they're all right.
The first ten albums were pretty good.

21:18.026 --> 21:21.697
You're Kevin Murphy, right?
I'm Alice Goldman.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.032
I was in PE class with you
in seventh grade.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.786
Oh, yeah. Mr. Versocki was so weird.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.705
Remember when he sat on his nutsack,

21:29.788 --> 21:31.665
and we got the rest
of the marking period off?

21:31.748 --> 21:33.709
[laughs] Yeah.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.044
So you're a Frodo fan?

21:36.128 --> 21:38.130
Yes! They're so smart and literary

21:38.213 --> 21:40.924
with their references
to Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.051
I just finished <i>Fellowship of the Ring.</i>

21:44.177 --> 21:45.345
Frodo's in a book?

21:45.429 --> 21:46.638
You've never read it?

21:47.097 --> 21:50.726
Oh, I don't read much.
All that brainiac stuff isn't for me.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.520
I take the dumb classes with the kids
that look like they're 25.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.063
You don't seem dumb to me.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.606
Wait till you get to know me.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.899
[laughs]

21:57.983 --> 22:01.737
You know, a great sense of humor
is a sign of intelligence.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.405
[scoffs] You sound like my mom.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.324
Is she paying you to say this?

22:05.407 --> 22:09.828
No. [chuckles]
I'm just giving you a compliment. God!

22:09.911 --> 22:10.954
Oh. Huh.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.664
Feels weird.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.833
[stammers] I mean, thanks.

22:14.916 --> 22:18.837
Well, I'll see you around, Kevin.
Tell me how you like the book.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.091
Ah, I hope there's lots of pictures.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.178
I know you're happy you got your job back,

22:26.261 --> 22:29.556
but do you think maybe you want
to take it down a notch?

22:29.639 --> 22:32.309
I'm thinking I'll take it down
this whole banister.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.061
-[chuckles]
-[all cheering]

22:34.603 --> 22:38.440
If I'm not dead by the seventh stair,
I'm getting a new dealer. [chuckles]

22:38.523 --> 22:40.984
[all cheering]

22:41.860 --> 22:43.779
[man] You are a god!

22:48.075 --> 22:49.368
Ah.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.661
That's going straight to the bag.

22:52.454 --> 22:57.000
[clears throat] Well, it's speech time!
Greg, cross my legs for me, would you?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.168
Of course.

22:59.753 --> 23:00.754
More casual.

23:00.837 --> 23:05.133
If I could just have a minute to tell you
that there's no dimmer light than my son.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.928
Back off, Greg! I know Kevin
missed 60 days last year,

23:08.011 --> 23:09.888
and he's not here now
like I said he would be,

23:09.971 --> 23:11.890
and he got his foot caught
in a soda machine.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.017
But there is potential in him
to be an extraor--

23:14.101 --> 23:18.105
I hate to interrupt your groveling,
but I have to make my speech.

23:18.188 --> 23:21.233
Greg, your son gets the last spot
in the Dim Lights.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.359
We did it, son!

23:22.442 --> 23:23.902
You're going to hell, Dad.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.862
And you're going to college!

23:25.946 --> 23:27.489
But what about Kevin?

23:27.572 --> 23:28.949
He'll be fine.

23:29.032 --> 23:33.829
Society needs people to deliver the mail,
drive trucks, die in wars.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.205
But what about his future?

23:35.288 --> 23:37.582
Let's be honest, we both know Kevin.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.419
He's never shown
any interest in his future.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.879
But this is his last chance
to make something of himself.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.674
Otherwise, his whole life will pass
in the blink of an eye,

23:45.757 --> 23:48.802
and he won't have done anything
except pack lunches and make babies!

23:50.679 --> 23:55.851
Mrs. Murphy, we're not talking
about your son anymore, are we?

23:56.893 --> 23:59.771
Now let's start inspiring.

24:03.525 --> 24:08.155
Students of Huey Long High,
as we start the school year,

24:08.697 --> 24:12.742
I see in each of you a bright future,

24:12.826 --> 24:15.537
filled with limitless promise.

24:16.371 --> 24:21.668
Don't let anyone say you can't do
exactly what you want to do.

24:21.751 --> 24:25.464
That's what the doctors
have told me for years,

24:25.547 --> 24:28.216
that I'd never have the use
of my legs again

24:28.300 --> 24:30.093
and I'd never accomplish anything.

24:30.594 --> 24:35.182
Well, when detractors tell you
your dream is impossible,

24:35.849 --> 24:40.228
tell them what I am telling you now.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.313
Nothing...

24:41.813 --> 24:42.772
[grunts]

24:43.273 --> 24:44.774
...is... [grunts]

24:46.109 --> 24:48.195
...impossible!

24:49.237 --> 24:50.780
[crowd gasping]

24:50.864 --> 24:51.990
Oh, fuck.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.533
-[clamoring]
-[gasps]

24:53.617 --> 24:54.826
Oh, God.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.038
[Morgan] I can't feel my arms!

24:58.121 --> 25:00.499
You promised you were gonna be
a better dad this year,

25:00.582 --> 25:02.959
but you're doing the same old stuff.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.419
Oh, I am not!

25:04.503 --> 25:06.379
I came to the goddamn stupid thing,
didn't I?

25:06.463 --> 25:08.465
My dad never showed up
to parent-teacher night.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.175
I wish <i>he </i>took us tonight.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.137
What did you just say to me?

25:14.221 --> 25:17.849
I said I wish Grandpa Bill took us.
At least he's nice to us.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.267
A lot more than you.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.189
[Menard]
It's time to find some volunteers.

25:24.272 --> 25:27.317
First, we need a caring, selfless parent

25:27.400 --> 25:30.111
to help Mrs. Breckman
with our fourth-grade play.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.030
I'll show you who's a good father.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.366
I'll do it. I'll help with the play.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.243
-Really, Dad?
-Damn right.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.370
I love the theater!
I love the shit out of it!

25:38.453 --> 25:40.413
Much appreciated, Mr. Murphy.

25:40.872 --> 25:44.751
Next we need a parent to help
Coach Fitzsimmons with the hockey team.

25:44.834 --> 25:45.919
I'll do that also.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.171
-Dad, don't.
-This isn't about you, Bill.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.965
I'll help you, coach.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.176
I know we've had our problems,
but I care about the kids.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.554
-Even your little fucker here.
-Aw.

25:56.054 --> 26:00.976
Welcome aboard. "Assistant coach."

26:01.977 --> 26:05.480
Read it, kids. This here is what
a caring father looks like.

26:07.357 --> 26:10.569
Mom, I'm sorry I messed up my chance
to be a Dim Lighter.

26:10.652 --> 26:15.407
But don't worry 'cause I'm gonna try
harder to pull my grades up this year.

26:15.490 --> 26:16.992
I want to unlock my potential.

26:17.075 --> 26:21.788
Oh, well, that's good to hear.
Glad I finally made an impression on you.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.874
Oh, no, it wasn't you. This girl gave me
a book, and I think I might read it.

26:24.958 --> 26:25.959
Oh.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.127
Starts off great.

26:27.210 --> 26:30.672
"Copyright one-nine-five-four."
I'm hooked.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.675
Yeah, it's good. I read it in college.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.428
That's right, you went to college.

26:36.511 --> 26:39.681
I always forget that because,
you know, you're just like a mom.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.141
[groans]

26:41.224 --> 26:43.310
You really should've finished college.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.104
But I get it though.
You couldn't wait to have kids.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.772
Bolo said his mom might lose her foot.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.482
She went to the movies in just her socks

26:49.566 --> 26:51.443
and stepped on a petrified hot dog.
[laughs]

26:51.526 --> 26:53.445
I kind of talked to Huey Long tonight.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.197
Did you hear Principal Morgan
fell off the stage?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.783
[instrumental music playing]

27:26.686 --> 27:27.604
[whirring]

27:27.687 --> 27:29.147
[gunshot]

27:29.230 --> 27:31.608
[Long] <i>Huey Long sees everything!</i>
