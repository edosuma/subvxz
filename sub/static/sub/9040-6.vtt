WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:06.500
- DOODY-HEAD! DOODYHEAD!
- DOODY-HEAD!

00:06.500 --> 00:08.333
- DOODY-HEAD!
- DOODY-HEAD!

00:08.333 --> 00:10.867
- HEY, NO NAME-CALLING.
- DOODY-HEAD!

00:10.867 --> 00:12.367
- GUYS...
[door closes]

00:12.367 --> 00:14.367
- WHERE YOU BEEN
FOR THE LAST HOUR?

00:14.367 --> 00:16.433
- I TOLD YOU,
I WAS GOING TO THE STORE.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.333
- DID THEY
MAKE YOU LOCK UP?

00:21.900 --> 00:23.267
- EXCUSE ME?

00:23.267 --> 00:25.333
- HOW CAN I WRITE
WHEN THIS WHOLE PLACE

00:25.333 --> 00:28.233
IS CRAWLING WITH DOODY-HEADS?

00:28.233 --> 00:29.900
- OH, WERE THEY NOISY?

00:29.900 --> 00:32.233
GOSH, WHEN I'M ALONE WITH THEM,
THEY JUST SIT IN THE CORNER

00:32.233 --> 00:36.833
AND READ THE BIBLE.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.367
- LISTEN, COME HERE.
SIT DOWN FOR ONE SECOND, PLEASE.

00:39.367 --> 00:42.200
JUST SIT DOWN, I WANT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.133
- [clears throat]

00:45.133 --> 00:46.633
- I NEED HELP, OKAY?

00:46.633 --> 00:49.367
I'M UNDER THE GUN HERE
TO FINISH A CHAPTER,

00:49.367 --> 00:52.267
SO I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD

00:52.267 --> 00:55.200
KIND OF PICK UP THE SLACK
HERE TILL I'M DONE.

01:03.133 --> 01:06.433
- MY WHOLE LIFE
IS PICKING UP THE SLACK.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.167
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT, LOOK,

01:10.167 --> 01:12.800
ALL I NEED IS ONE DAY
WITHOUT ANY DISTRACTIONS.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.167
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE THE KIDS
FOR THE REST OF TODAY.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.667
YOU HAPPY?
- THAT'S GREAT,

01:16.667 --> 01:18.367
THAT'S GREAT, THAT'S GREAT,
BUT YOU KNOW,

01:18.367 --> 01:20.267
TODAY'S
NOT REALLY A FULL DAY

01:20.267 --> 01:22.300
WHEN YOU CONSIDER
THAT IT'S ALREADY 2:30--

01:22.300 --> 01:23.933
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, RAY?

01:23.933 --> 01:26.133
- WELL, I MEAN, THE PUBLISHER
WANTS TO SEE SOME STUFF

01:26.133 --> 01:27.633
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.200
SO THE ONLY TIME
I COULD WORK ON IT WOULD BE,

01:29.200 --> 01:30.833
I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS THIS WEEKEND.

01:30.833 --> 01:32.767
- BUT THIS WEEKEND IS OUR
CAMPING TRIP WITH THE PARKERS.

01:32.767 --> 01:37.600
- OH, OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.533
HMM.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.300
- YOU WANT ME
TO GO CAMPING WITHOUT YOU

01:46.300 --> 01:47.533
WITH ALL THE KIDS?

01:47.533 --> 01:48.833
ARE YOU INSANE?

01:48.833 --> 01:50.400
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S A LITTLE
EXTRA SLACK. I KNOW.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.333
- YEAH, LISTEN, YOU WASTE TIME
FOR OVER A YEAR,

01:53.333 --> 01:54.667
AND THEN YOU
EXPECT ME TO SUFFER

01:54.667 --> 01:56.400
SO YOU CAN FINALLY
START GETTING SERIOUS?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.067
- YOU DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO SUFFER?

01:58.067 --> 02:00.100
I'M SACRIFICING THE MOST
PRECIOUS THING OF ALL--

02:00.100 --> 02:03.433
TIME WITH MY CHILDREN, HUH?

02:03.433 --> 02:04.867
YOU DON'T THINK I GOT
"CAT'S IN THE CRADLE"

02:04.867 --> 02:07.667
PLAYING UP HERE?

02:07.667 --> 02:11.067
- I THINK YOU GOT TWO MONKEYS
AND A YO-YO PLAYING UP THERE.

02:14.533 --> 02:16.867
- YEAH.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.933
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO BE
AN AUTHOR--THAT'S WHAT IT IS--

02:18.933 --> 02:21.767
'CAUSE THERE'LL BE A BOOK TOUR
AND THEN THE GROUPIES.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.467
- [chuckles]

02:24.467 --> 02:28.967
NOW THERE'S
A SAD BUNCH OF WOMEN.

02:28.967 --> 02:30.267
- YEAH.

02:30.267 --> 02:34.900
SAD BUT HAPPY,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.433
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

02:37.433 --> 02:40.200
- COME ON.
WHAT, DO YOU WANT ME TO BEG?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.700
I'M NO GOOD
AT ASKING FOR HELP.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.933
IT'S MY BIGGEST FLAW.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.500
- [laughs]

02:44.500 --> 02:48.000
- OH, DON'T BE MEAN.
COME ON, FEEL BAD FOR ME.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.200
HELP ME.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.800
IT'S MY DREAM
TO WRITE A BOOK.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
- [sighs]

02:55.800 --> 02:57.033
OH, ALL RIGHT, RAY.

02:57.033 --> 03:00.700
- HA-HA.
YOU LOVE MY YO-YO MONKEYS.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.733
- ALL RIGHT, BUT, LISTEN,
WHILE WE'RE GONE, YOU WORK.

03:03.733 --> 03:04.833
- YES.
- YES?

03:04.833 --> 03:06.167
- RIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.967
- YOU DO NOT PLAY GOLF.
YOU DO NOT WATCH TV.

03:07.967 --> 03:09.300
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
NO FUN.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.833
- NO, I'M NOT KIDDING, RAY.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.033
- I KNOW.
NO KIDDING.

03:12.033 --> 03:14.033
NO FUN.
I PROMISE.

03:14.033 --> 03:16.767
STOP LOOKING AT ME.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.933
- AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU BREAK
THAT PROMISE, I'LL KNOW.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.333
- I KNOW YOU'LL KNOW,

03:20.333 --> 03:25.100
AND THEN--THEN
YOU'LL HAVE TO PUNISH ME.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.333
- OH, I'LL PUNISH YOU.
- OH, YEAH?

03:27.333 --> 03:30.533
- SERIOUSLY, RAY,
I'LL HURT YOU.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.533
WORK, RAY.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.367
- OKAY, YOU GUYS
GO STRAIGHT UPSTAIRS--

03:45.367 --> 03:46.767
GO RIGHT TO THE BATH,
ALL RIGHT?

03:46.767 --> 03:48.100
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.833
- HI, DEARS.
- HI, GRANDMA.

03:50.833 --> 03:55.067
- HI, WELCOME BACK, DEBRA.
HOW WAS YOUR CAMPING VACATION?

03:55.067 --> 03:56.267
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:56.267 --> 03:59.200
- AH, CAMPING, THAT'S GREAT.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.467
HEY, UH, WHAT DID
YOU USE FOR TOILET PAPER?

04:04.467 --> 04:06.533
- TOILET PAPER.

04:06.533 --> 04:10.233
- THEN IT WASN'T REALLY CAMPING.

04:10.233 --> 04:14.000
I CAN TELL YOU A STORY--
- OKAY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, FRANK.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.567
- RAYMOND SAID YOU WEREN'T
GETTING BACK UNTIL TOMORROW.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.900
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT BETWEEN
THE RAIN AND THE BUGS

04:18.900 --> 04:20.467
AND THE KIDS GOING NUTS,

04:20.467 --> 04:22.800
I DECIDED
WE HAD ENOUGH VACATION.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.367
IS HE IN THE OFFICE?

04:38.433 --> 04:41.700
- HI, HI.
OH, YOU'RE ALL MUDDY.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.667
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, RAY?

04:45.667 --> 04:46.933
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

04:46.933 --> 04:48.067
I-I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING--

04:48.067 --> 04:49.533
- REALLY?

04:49.533 --> 04:52.233
THEN WHY AREN'T YOU
PROTECTING YOURSELF?

04:52.233 --> 04:55.067
- NO, NO, LISTEN, LISTEN,
I FINISHED, OKAY?

04:55.067 --> 04:56.400
I ENDED UP WORKING
THROUGH THE NIGHT,

04:56.400 --> 04:57.867
AND I FINISHED
THE FIRST CHAPTER.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.300
AND THEN THIS MORNING I WAS ABLE
TO KNOCK OFF THE SECOND,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.567
AND THEN I JUST--
I FAXED IT OVER TO THE GUY.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.533
- RAYMOND WORKED VERY HARD
SO HE COULD GET IT ALL DONE

05:04.533 --> 05:06.600
SO HE COULD HAVE
SOME TIME TO RELAX--

05:06.600 --> 05:09.533
LIKE YOU.

05:13.667 --> 05:16.133
- RAY, AFTER EVERYTHING
WE DISCUSSED,

05:16.133 --> 05:17.233
HOW COULD YOU GO OUT--

05:17.233 --> 05:18.633
[telephone rings]

05:18.633 --> 05:20.833
- YEAH, HELLO.
YEAH, THIS IS ME.

05:20.833 --> 05:23.400
I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

05:26.767 --> 05:27.900
- HELLO.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.400
- OH, HI, ROBBIE.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.800
YOU WANT SOME ANGEL FOOD CAKE
AND CHOCOLATE SAUCE?

05:31.800 --> 05:33.700
- OF COURSE.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.633
LISTEN,
I HAVE SOME NEWS--

05:35.633 --> 05:39.700
- HEY, HOW COME HE GOT
SO MUCH CHOCOLATE SAUCE?

05:39.700 --> 05:42.300
- YOU GOT THE SAME AMOUNT.
- NO, NO, NO.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.567
LOOK AT ALL
THAT CHOCOLATE SAUCE.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.433
YOU TOLD ME I COULDN'T HAVE
ANY MORE CHOCOLATE SAUCE

05:46.433 --> 05:49.467
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ENOUGH, HUH?

05:49.467 --> 05:53.200
I GET TWO DROPS,
AND HE GETS A RIVER.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.233
IT'S A LAKE.
LOOK HOW MUCH HE GETS.

05:56.233 --> 05:59.167
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

05:59.167 --> 06:04.067
WHAT, ARE YOU MESSING
WITH MY HEAD?

06:04.067 --> 06:07.200
- WELL, I CAN'T MESS
WITH YOUR HAIR.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.600
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

06:10.600 --> 06:12.267
UM, I WANTED
YOU GUYS TO KNOW--

06:12.267 --> 06:14.033
- RAY, I JUST WANT
TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING--

06:14.033 --> 06:15.367
WHY IS IT
YOUR MISSION IN LIFE

06:15.367 --> 06:18.567
TO AVOID SPENDING TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY?

06:18.567 --> 06:19.933
- THAT WAS MY AGENT.

06:19.933 --> 06:22.400
HE SAID THE PUBLISHER
READ MY STUFF,

06:22.400 --> 06:26.433
AND THEY DECIDED THEY DON'T
WANT ME TO WRITE THE BOOK.

06:26.433 --> 06:30.400
- OH, RAY, I'M SORRY.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.200
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.667
- I DON'T KNOW, MA.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.433
GUESS THEY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GOOD.

06:36.433 --> 06:39.433
- WERE THERE
SPELLING ERRORS?

06:46.267 --> 06:48.633
- IT'S THE YANKEES.
HOW CAN YOU SCREW THAT UP?

06:48.633 --> 06:50.367
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:50.367 --> 06:53.133
- HEY, I'M--
I'M SORRY, RAYMOND.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.800
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS
A BAD TIME.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.300
I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE
MY CAKE AND GO HOME.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.233
- DID YOU NEED SOMETHING,
ROBERT?

07:15.233 --> 07:17.567
- OH, NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.500
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
ROBBIE?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.100
- NO--NO, REALLY.
IT CAN WAIT.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.367
[loud whisper]
IT'S NOTHING.

07:24.367 --> 07:28.800
- WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.600
- I...

07:30.600 --> 07:31.867
I MADE LIEUTENANT.

07:31.867 --> 07:35.000
[all gasp]

07:43.167 --> 07:45.233
I PASSED THE TEST.

07:45.233 --> 07:47.067
I-I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT
TILL SOMEBODY RETIRES,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.767
BUT THEY'RE GOING
TO PROMOTE ME.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.900
- OH!
OH, WOW.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.867
CONGRATULATIONS, ROBERT.
THAT IS GREAT.

07:53.867 --> 07:54.900
- THANK YOU.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.000
- UH, YEAH,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.400
HEY, UH,
WAY TO GO THERE, SON.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.767
LIEUTENANT.
THAT'S REALLY UP THERE.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.367
- IT'S VERY--

08:09.367 --> 08:12.300
VERY EXCITING NEWS,
ROBBIE.

08:14.133 --> 08:17.300
IT'S VERY EXCITING.

08:17.300 --> 08:21.100
MY SON--A LIEUTENANT.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.233
- OH, I AM
SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.667
MWAH.
THIS IS REALLY GREAT, ROBERT.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.233
- THANK--THANK YOU, DEB.
- ISN'T IT, RAY?

08:34.233 --> 08:37.233
- YEAH. IT'S GREAT.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.300
- LISTEN...
[door closes]

08:45.300 --> 08:48.767
I WANT
HIS CHOCOLATE SAUCE.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.900
- YOU GOING
STRAIGHT TO BED?

09:07.900 --> 09:10.600
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WATCH TV
OR READ OR ANYTHING?

09:10.600 --> 09:13.733
- I CAN'T WRITE.
WHY SHOULD I READ?

09:18.333 --> 09:21.967
I MEAN,
WHAT'S THE POINT REALLY, HUH?

09:21.967 --> 09:24.300
WHAT IS THE POINT?

09:24.300 --> 09:27.400
- ARE YOU FINISHED?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.600
- IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO MY WRITING CAREER--

09:30.600 --> 09:32.633
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.533
LOOK, HONEY,
I KNOW YOU FEEL BAD,

09:34.533 --> 09:36.433
AND I'M SORRY YOUR BOOK'S
NOT COMING OUT,

09:36.433 --> 09:41.067
BUT YOU'VE GOT A GREAT JOB
AND A FAMILY WHO LOVES YOU.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.300
- THAT'S WHAT
YOU ALWAYS SAY.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.467
- OH, OKAY, FINE.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.000
THAT'S IT.
I'M DONE.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.033
YOU JUST MOPE AWAY,
MOPEY.

09:49.033 --> 09:51.567
- HEY, LOOK,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.467
- I UNDERSTAND. NO.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.033
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO WRITE A BOOK,

09:55.033 --> 09:56.233
AND YOU WILL,

09:56.233 --> 09:58.200
AND YOU CAN DEDICATE IT
TO YOUR EX-WIFE

09:58.200 --> 10:01.400
WHO COULDN'T TAKE
YOUR CRAP ANY LONGER.

10:03.767 --> 10:06.367
- YEAH.

10:06.367 --> 10:09.767
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.067
FUNNY.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.400
WHY DON'T YOU
SHARE A LAUGH OVER THAT

10:12.400 --> 10:15.067
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND ROBERT?

10:15.067 --> 10:19.033
- OH, RIGHT.
SO THAT'S IT--ROBERT.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.800
THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.067
- NO!

10:25.067 --> 10:27.200
DID YOU SEE HIM
YESTERDAY, HUH?

10:27.200 --> 10:28.667
JUST FLAUNTING
HIS BIG NEWS

10:28.667 --> 10:32.033
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY HORRIBLE CRI--TIME?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.367
- HE DIDN'T FLAUNT IT, RAY.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.867
WE--WE PRACTICALLY HAD
TO FORCE HIM TO TELL US.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.200
- OH, YEAH.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.000
DID YOU FORCE
THAT BIG STUPID SMILE

10:41.000 --> 10:43.900
ON HIS HUGE CLOWN FACE?

10:43.900 --> 10:45.033
- YOU'RE NUTS.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.300
- YEAH, AND THEN YOU GO

10:46.300 --> 10:47.833
SHOWERING HIM
WITH FANCY GIFTS.

10:47.833 --> 10:50.500
- IT WAS A SWEATER,
AND IT'S FROM BOTH OF US.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.133
- YEAH, WELL,
I HOPE IT'S ITCHY,

10:52.133 --> 10:55.233
'CAUSE THAT'S THE PART
FROM ME.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.133
- YOU KNOW,
ROBERT NEVER GETS ANYTHING,

11:03.133 --> 11:04.633
AND THE ONE TIME
THAT HE DOES,

11:04.633 --> 11:05.733
WHAT DO YOU DO?

11:05.733 --> 11:06.867
YOU SLAM THE TABLE
