     He's in the village,
    asking everybody, "Why

03:23.904 --> 03:27.239
  No one has the heart to say,
  "Hey, buddy, you can't grow,

19:01.641 --> 19:03.908
   - Three Niner Alpha, 66.
  We're clearing the village.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.848
     - Three Niner Alpha,

19:10.850 --> 19:15.353
        4012 8883. Over.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.361
Zero, this is Three Niner Alpha.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.363
     66 coming home. Over.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.733
      - Zero acknowledge.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.335
            Fuck...

19:59.531 --> 20:01.532
            <i> - KAF.</i>

20:01.534 --> 20:04.702
  <i> You might as well be on Mars</i>
      <i> as in Afghanistan.</i>

20:04.704 --> 20:06.704
   <i> We're out in the middle</i>
       <i> of the desert,</i>

20:06.706 --> 20:08.839
    <i> surrounded by a forest</i>
        <i> of razor wire.</i>

20:08.841 --> 20:12.610
<i>It's a coalition force from over</i>
 <i> forty-five different nations.</i>

20:12.612 --> 20:15.880
   <i> Two-thirds of the soldiers</i>
   <i> deployed here never even</i>
       <i> see the country,</i>

20:15.882 --> 20:19.717
   <i> they just see blast walls</i>
   <i> and defects, Tim Horton's.</i>

20:19.719 --> 20:22.720
   <i> Nobody even knows how many</i>
   <i> people are on this base;</i>

20:22.722 --> 20:26.591
   <i> thirty-five, forty-five,</i>
       <i> sixty thousand.</i>

20:26.593 --> 20:30.695
  <i> It's here, inside the wire,</i>
  <i> that we organize everything</i>
 <i> that goes on outside the wire,</i>

20:30.697 --> 20:32.763
      <i> and half the time</i>
      <i> we got it wrong.</i>

20:32.765 --> 20:34.899
  <i> But that means half the time</i>
       <i> we got it right.</i>

20:36.902 --> 20:40.771
   <i> It's a vast organism that</i>
   <i> consumes 14 metric tons</i>
        <i> of food a day</i>

20:40.773 --> 20:44.976
<i>and shits into a lake that fills</i>
 <i> the air with 30% fecal matter.</i>

20:47.346 --> 20:51.382
     <i> In KAF, you breathe</i>
       <i> your own shit.</i>

20:53.352 --> 20:55.353
    <i> - I'm building a road,</i>
          <i> gentlemen,</i>

20:55.355 --> 20:58.389
I'm building a big fucking road
 and it's going like a dagger

20:58.391 --> 21:01.492
  into the heart of the enemy
   and it is fucking him up.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.728
And every morning
he wakes up,

21:03.730 --> 21:05.863
          and I'm standing there
            and I'm punching him
      right in his fucking face.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.368
 Now we've never been this deep
  into the heart of Panjaway,

21:10.370 --> 21:13.771
      but Hyena Road is in there
    and she is in there to stay.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.774
    And they don't like it,
   'cause we're fucking with
   their freedom of movement.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.278
So they're going after our dump
 trucks and our gravel trucks
       and our workers.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.314
     - What are you saying?
          - I'm saying

21:23.316 --> 21:26.851
     I've lost 36 civilians
  in the last four months and
  this bullshit's got to stop.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.453
 And I'm going to need a little
         help from you.
           - General,

21:29.455 --> 21:33.024
      I am just one man--
- You're Bashir Daoud Khan, BDK.

21:33.026 --> 21:34.925
 You're one man with a militia.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.497
- And I'm your partner in peace.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.767
     - So I need your eyes
         and your ears

21:42.769 --> 21:44.935
         and I need you
       and your son to be

21:44.937 --> 21:47.705
    at our little dedication
   ceremony-- how many clicks
         there, Shorty?

21:47.707 --> 21:51.676
        - Fifteen, sir.
      - Fifteen clicks of
     hardtop into the Horn.

21:51.678 --> 21:55.079
      Your presence there
   would be very meaningful.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.723
                    - Hyena Road
                       is a gift

22:05.725 --> 22:08.926
                 to all Afghans.
           It would be an honour

22:08.928 --> 22:12.063
             for my father and I
        to attend your ceremony.

22:12.065 --> 22:16.734
    - Out-fucking-standing.

22:19.104 --> 22:22.840
     - Thank you, General.
       - Thank you, sir.

22:33.518 --> 22:37.088
    - Look at that little prick.
             He's like Caligula.

22:37.090 --> 22:41.826
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
to get Hyena built if that prick
would stop breathing.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.628
- Yeah, right there
you're right. Look,
I'm gonna hop a flight.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.897
I wanna get out to Sper and
run down a lead on an Elder.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.934
        Tell Armstrong
  I'll call in from the FOB.
- You don't wanna hang with me?

22:49.936 --> 22:52.737
- Oh, you know there is
nothing I'd rather do,

22:52.739 --> 22:56.874
but the future of Western
civilization depends on my ass
getting out to Sper.

23:07.652 --> 23:11.822
              ¶¶¶

23:55.167 --> 23:59.737
<i>Alexander the Great marched into</i>
<i>this graveyard about twenty-five</i>
      <i> hundred years ago.</i>

23:59.739 --> 24:04.442
    <i> Easy to march in; hard</i>
   <i> to march out. His words.</i>

24:04.444 --> 24:06.644
   <i> He and his mother wrote</i>
  <i> to each other all the time.</i>

24:06.646 --> 24:08.813
  <i> And one day he got a letter</i>
<i>from her saying, "What the hell?</i>

24:08.815 --> 24:11.949
<i>"You conquered most of the known</i>
<i>world in like a day and a half,</i>

24:11.951 --> 24:14.685
 <i> what are you doing bogged down</i>
       <i> in Afghanistan?"</i>

24:14.687 --> 24:17.021
     <i> He grabbed a bag and</i>
   <i> shoveled it full of dirt</i>

24:17.023 --> 24:19.557
<i> and had it sent back to Greece</i>
<i> <i> with a message to his mother:</i></i>

24:19.559 --> 24:23.461
  <i> "Take this dirt and dump it</i>
     <i> around the palace,</i>
     <i> see what happens."</i>

24:51.591 --> 24:54.859
<i>- So Alexander's mother spread</i>
<i>the dirt all around the palace.</i>

24:54.861 --> 24:58.262
 <i> Later that night a couple of</i>
 <i> attendants showed up, to make</i>
    <i> sure she was alright.</i>

24:58.264 --> 25:00.698
 <i> One says, go ahead, after you.</i>

25:00.700 --> 25:03.968
   <i> And the other one says,</i>
   <i> no, after you. And the</i>
     <i> first one says, no,</i>

25:03.970 --> 25:06.971
  <i> I insist. And the second one</i>
   <i> says, don't you tell me</i>
         <i> what to do,</i>

25:06.973 --> 25:09.106
<i>and they both pull their swords</i>
      <i> and they go at it</i>

25:09.108 --> 25:11.175
  <i> until they kill each other.</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:14.078
 <i> Alexander's mother watched all</i>
    <i> this and wrote a note</i>
        <i> to him saying,</i>

25:14.080 --> 25:17.248
   <i> okay, okay, now I get it.</i>

25:17.250 --> 25:21.051
<i>And he wrote back, saying, yeah,</i>
   <i> even the dirt is hostile.</i>

25:21.053 --> 25:25.055
<i>In Afghanistan, dogs fight dogs,</i>

25:25.057 --> 25:28.125
<i>birds fight birds, men kill men.</i>

25:28.127 --> 25:30.794
            - Fire!

25:44.109 --> 25:48.145
     - Mind if I join you?
 - Not at all, Warrant, please.

25:57.989 --> 26:01.091
      Hey, I got an update
       from the Engineer

26:01.093 --> 26:05.029
on that stretch of Hyena
from yesterday. They
cleared 8 IEDs in all.

26:05.031 --> 26:08.299
      Something went wrong
  with the last one-- the guy
  lost his leg above the knee.

26:08.301 --> 26:12.670
They airlifted him to Landstuhl.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.072
    I think we need to talk.
          - Hey, uh...

26:15.074 --> 26:18.943
  Hi, Jenn, sorry to interrupt
 here. Ryan, I'm Pete Mitchell,
    one of the effects guys

26:18.945 --> 26:23.347
at Brigade. Didn't mean to wreck
   your meal, but you mind if
    I have a word with you?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.282
            - Sure.

26:25.284 --> 26:29.053
     Catch up to you later.

26:35.694 --> 26:39.763
- I was in the TOC when you guys
             had that engagement
                   in Haji Baba.

26:39.765 --> 26:44.602
         You were fucking lucky.

26:44.604 --> 26:48.639
  - Come all the way out here
       to tell me that?
             - No.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.342
             No, I came out here
                      because...

26:51.344 --> 26:54.011
  and I could be way out of line
             here but, you know,

26:54.013 --> 26:56.347
     manifestly you and Jenn got
       a little something going.

26:56.349 --> 27:00.184
  On behalf of the entire battle
 group, I'd just like to express

27:00.186 --> 27:03.687
our collective fuckin' jealousy.

27:03.689 --> 27:06.023
- You got a girl?

27:06.025 --> 27:09.760
                 - Yep. Woman of
            my dreams back home.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.630
  - Does she know what you do?
           - My wife?

27:12.632 --> 27:15.399
           No, she thinks I work
                 inside the wire

27:15.401 --> 27:18.836
       and I'm going to leave it
         that way. Let her sleep
                  easy at night.

27:21.873 --> 27:24.708
       Tell me something.

27:24.710 --> 27:27.845
    How much you do you know
       about Pashtunwali?

27:27.847 --> 27:30.848
     - Well, whatever's in
    the handbook. You know,

27:30.850 --> 27:34.018
 it's a tribal code. It's old.
          - Oh yeah.

27:34.020 --> 27:38.389
It's so old they look upon Islam
as a kind of recent add-on.

27:38.391 --> 27:41.358
               - What are those?

27:41.360 --> 27:43.661
- They're dates.
They're local.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.764
They help you shit.

27:49.167 --> 27:53.203
    The code has got a bunch of,
   well, they call them pillars,

27:53.205 --> 27:56.206
                      and one of
                  them is Panah,

27:56.208 --> 27:58.742
       which means 'protection',
                   more or less.

27:58.744 --> 28:01.311
  So when that Elder invited you
into his home he gave you Panah:

28:01.313 --> 28:03.847
   no harm could come to you.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.352
   - So I owe him, you mean?
       - Well, he did it

28:08.354 --> 28:12.189
  for Allah, he didn't do it for
you. But you are still breathing
         so that'd be your call.

28:16.161 --> 28:18.362
                     This Elder,

28:18.364 --> 28:21.198
       did he speak any English?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.401
- No.
Just a couple words.

28:24.403 --> 28:27.705
     - Any marks about him,
           any scars?
             - No,

28:27.707 --> 28:30.040
     but he had weird eyes.
          - Weird how?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.943
       - His left eye was brown.
    His right eye was deep blue.

28:36.314 --> 28:38.849
So who is this guy?

28:38.851 --> 28:41.819
Why'd he... why'd he
give me this Panah?

28:41.821 --> 28:44.855
                   - That's what
                 I want to know.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.891
  I got a patrol going back into
     the village in the morning.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.395
              I'd really like it
             if you'd come along
    with me, help me ID the guy.

28:51.397 --> 28:55.099
  - Yeah, sure, I'll be there.
            - O900.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.167
           - Alright.
           - Alright.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.937
 - I'll see you in the morning.
            - Yeah.

29:41.412 --> 29:43.447
    - What are you thinking?

29:43.449 --> 29:46.216
            - Hmm...

29:46.218 --> 29:49.219
  I'm thinking about our hotel
        room in Cyprus.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.295
            - Umm...

30:00.498 --> 30:03.100
 Okay, I'm gonna say something

30:03.102 --> 30:06.069
and I'm gonna say it for both of
 us and it's going to be shitty

30:06.071 --> 30:08.806
    and it's got to be said.

30:11.876 --> 30:13.844
           - Fuck me.

30:13.846 --> 30:17.481
- You know that I am completely
crazy about you.
And Cyprus was...

30:22.020 --> 30:24.087
Cyprus was perfect.

30:25.990 --> 30:29.927
We're perfect. But we can't keep
doing this. We both know that.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.162
If we get caught,

30:32.164 --> 30:36.133
    I'm gonna get cashiered.
       This is my career.
       - It's mine, too.

30:36.135 --> 30:40.137
- I know, this is what I'm
saying. When we rotate home,

30:40.139 --> 30:43.507
we'll see. But right now, while
we're here, it's gotta stop.

30:47.579 --> 30:51.348
                - So this is it?

30:51.350 --> 30:54.184
- I think it has to be.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.927
                  - This is like
             fucking Armageddon.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.263
           - I know.

31:08.466 --> 31:11.268
   You know there is nothing
    that I would rather do

31:11.270 --> 31:14.571
   than climb over there and
fraternize the shit out of you.

31:14.573 --> 31:17.341
            - Hmm...

31:19.344 --> 31:21.445
               You can't dump me
                 in one sentence

31:21.447 --> 31:26.016
               and say something
          like that in the next.

31:31.155 --> 31:33.891
                           Ah...

32:12.196 --> 32:15.198
- Now, when you get to the grape
    fields, if you see wire,

32:15.200 --> 32:18.936
 you see metal, you see plastic
     or newly turned dirt?

32:18.938 --> 32:22.139
Don't step on it. If you didn't
  drop it, don't pick it up.

32:22.141 --> 32:26.176
 Try to stay at least five body
  lengths between the next man
         in the patrol.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.646
  When we get in the village,
   you're going to see women
       dressed in bags.

32:29.648 --> 32:33.951
 Please don't stare at them. I
 know you've probably seen that
      in Toronto or Paris,

32:33.953 --> 32:38.121
 but you haven't seen it here.
   Here, those bags are like
    magnets for your eyes.

32:38.123 --> 32:42.326
   If you get caught staring
      at them, it's gonna
     fuck shit up for us.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.630
    Quick clot, Tourniquet,

32:46.632 --> 32:49.433
           bandage.
      - I don't know how
      to use any of that.

32:49.435 --> 32:53.637
  - Ma'am, if it has to be used,
       it won't be you using it.

33:40.585 --> 33:42.219
        Salaam Alaikum.

33:44.088 --> 33:47.357
Hey! Eyes.

33:52.063 --> 33:54.698
       - Salaam Alaikum.
       - Alaikum Salaam.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.667
       - This is my PTM.

33:57.669 --> 34:01.104
In my job, it is a great honour
      to meet Elders such
      as yourself today.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.173
            And if you chose so,
               it is a good day.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.643
        But I was hoping to meet
  another elder in this village?

34:18.822 --> 34:22.759
- He insists that "I'm the only
elder and there is no other".

34:22.761 --> 34:25.762
- Strange, because someone
told me there was another

34:25.764 --> 34:28.498
 important man who lived in this
 village, but I forget his name.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.835
        But this person said you
  couldn't forget him because he
had two different coloured eyes.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.788
- Hey! Hey. What's in your head?
        You're too high.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.591
 You can see the women without
their bags. Get down. Get down!

34:54.592 --> 34:58.195
         - Sorry, sir.
 - I think you know who I mean.

34:59.797 --> 35:03.200
    - He says he's a ghost.
   - Even ghosts have to live
           somewhere.

35:11.742 --> 35:15.612
- He says most of them
live in Kandahar City.

35:33.264 --> 35:37.300
     - Haji, what the fuck
         are you doing?
    - The carpets are dusty.

35:37.302 --> 35:40.504
- The entire country is dusty.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.472
 Come on, let's have some tea.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.609
      Step into my office.
   - How are you doing, Pete?

35:45.611 --> 35:47.811
      How is your family?
       How is your time?

35:47.813 --> 35:51.148
   - It's good. How is yours?

35:51.150 --> 35:53.683
   Have you heard from Kabul?
     When will you see 'em?

35:53.685 --> 35:57.254
      - Soon. Insha Allah.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.889
- You're frowning.

36:01.225 --> 36:04.327
 - I thought you were crazy, but
         I was wrong and I don't
               like to be wrong.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.596
                  My cousin says
                maybe it is him.

36:06.598 --> 36:10.233
         - In K-City?
- He thinks so. Why is he back?

36:10.235 --> 36:14.704
      - If it's even him.
        - But the eyes?

36:17.308 --> 36:19.442
- If it is him, do you think
you can get me in to see him?

36:19.444 --> 36:21.778
      - My uncle has arranged it
                   for tomorrow.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.314
- Tell him I'm gonna
bring along another guy,

36:24.316 --> 36:27.384
       the Master Sniper
     with the battle group.
       - One other thing.

36:27.386 --> 36:30.820
     It's not relational--
          - Related.
        - Related, yes.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.223
           I'm hearing something
                about an attack.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.926
          - In K-City?
   - Soon. That's all I know.

36:35.928 --> 36:37.961
     As soon as I find out more,
                I will tell you.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.497
    - Okay.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.966
How are you?
You need anything?

36:42.968 --> 36:46.236
        - No, I'm good.
 - You always say you're good.

36:46.238 --> 36:49.940
- I'm Afghan.

36:49.942 --> 36:52.742
- Oh listen, I got you...

36:52.744 --> 36:56.479
I got you some of that shampoo.
            - What?

36:56.481 --> 37:00.217
- Some of that hand cream
you guys are so crazy about.

37:03.488 --> 37:06.389
  - Thank you, this is great.
  - You're welcome, my friend.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.960
- This is my favourite.

37:09.962 --> 37:13.263
   - Guys, listen up. This is
 straight from the brass. Guys!

37:13.265 --> 37:16.833
   Listen. Alright... No more
    fraternizing with goats!

37:16.835 --> 37:19.336
   You bunch of goat-fuckers.

37:19.338 --> 37:23.240
- Okay, listen up. All four dets
are out tonight, All Ops
are observe and report,

37:23.242 --> 37:25.942
except for you, Travis. You guys
are on that bend in Hyena

37:25.944 --> 37:27.477
where that fucking tree is,
so keep your eyes peeled.

37:29.447 --> 37:33.950
  I've been seconded to intel
  for the day so I'm heading
         into K-City.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.952
 Wilf here is going to step up.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.622
- Nice. Wilf!

37:38.624 --> 37:42.392
                - Alright, I got
                  some bad news.

37:42.394 --> 37:45.996
 They grabbed a couple of guys
from 10th Mountain Dog Company.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.765
            - What?
- Yeah. I don't know the details

37:48.767 --> 37:50.767
      but there was an IED
         of some sort,

37:50.769 --> 37:52.902
        and the Tallies
      grabbed two of them.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.973
       - Are they alive?
            - Yeah.

38:02.346 --> 38:04.748
            - Fuck!

38:06.684 --> 38:09.719
You can blow me up with an IED,

38:09.721 --> 38:14.357
  shoot me with an AK, fucking
    run me over with a LAV--

38:16.394 --> 38:20.697
  I'm fucking fine with that!
  But do not let me be taken
       alive by these...

38:20.699 --> 38:24.301
     fucking medievalists.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.736
- You good?

38:28.606 --> 38:31.908
        - What exactly
      do they do to you?
      - It's unspeakable.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.779
- New comm logs. Fill them out.
     - What do you mean--
            - Hey.

38:35.781 --> 38:38.815
   Unspeakable means we don't
    fucking speak about it.

38:59.737 --> 39:02.639
        - Targets down.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.874
         Let's back up.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.856
       First time, Wilf,
       how do you feel?
            - Good.

39:19.858 --> 39:23.827
         - Ready to go?
        - No, not quite.
      I gotta take a shit.

39:23.829 --> 39:27.030
          - What? Why?
   - Why, I don't know, maybe
   'cause my lower intestine

39:27.032 --> 39:29.032
                is full of shit?
               Give me your bag.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.868
        - Alright, fine.
           - Thanks.

39:37.842 --> 39:40.443
     - What a beautiful night...

39:40.445 --> 39:44.514
You know, if they get this place
        together, I'd come back.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.916
      Bring Joey camping.
          - Camping.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.918
            - Yeah.
         - In Kandahar?

39:48.920 --> 39:51.821
      - Why the fuck not?

39:51.823 --> 39:54.924
- Number two totally offloaded.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.528
          Good to go.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.065
      - Three Niner Alpha,

40:02.067 --> 40:05.935
    this is 66 Bravo. Ready
     for extraction. Over.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.072
         - Let's move.

40:26.857 --> 40:30.093
  - It's a beautiful morning.
   - Has been for two hours.

40:30.095 --> 40:34.631
   How long until the convoy?
    - Should be on the move,
    five, ten mikes, maybe.

40:34.633 --> 40:38.802
     - These A&A Dudes...
     You trust these guys?

40:38.804 --> 40:41.604
- With my life.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.073
        It's their war.
 We're just along for the ride.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.075
         Hey, Walid...

40:46.077 --> 40:49.979
            - Huh?
        - What's he got
      going on the tunes?

40:53.517 --> 40:57.487
        - Leif Garrett.
 - You're shitting me. Come on,
  put it out for all to hear.

40:57.489 --> 41:01.124
            - Yeah?
        - ¶¶ Playin' in
     a rock and roll band ¶

41:01.126 --> 41:05.762
  ¶ I never had no problems ¶

41:05.764 --> 41:10.099
         ¶ Burnin' down
       one night stands ¶

41:10.101 --> 41:14.170
       ¶ And everything
       around me, yeah ¶

41:14.172 --> 41:17.941
 ¶ Got to stop feelin' so low ¶

41:17.943 --> 41:21.211
   ¶ And I decided quickly ¶

41:21.213 --> 41:23.746
         ¶ Yes I did ¶

41:23.748 --> 41:27.584
        ¶ To disco down
    and check out the show ¶

41:27.586 --> 41:30.119
       ¶ Yeah they were
     dancin' and singin' ¶

41:30.121 --> 41:33.022
 ¶ And movin' to the groovin' ¶

41:33.024 --> 41:37.060
   ¶ And just when it hit me
    somebody turned around
         and shouted ¶

41:37.062 --> 41:40.563
    ¶ Play that funky music
          white boy ¶

41:40.565 --> 41:44.901
¶ Play that funky music right ¶

41:46.036 --> 41:49.939
    ¶ Play that funky music
          white boy ¶

41:49.941 --> 41:52.642
    ¶ Lay down that boogie ¶
        - Okay, cowboys,

41:52.644 --> 41:54.677
     on the move. Mount up.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.814
   - ¶ Play that funky music
 till you die, till you die ¶¶

42:14.865 --> 42:17.834
     - Gulf Niner Whiskey,
    we're falling in. Over.

43:11.355 --> 43:13.756
    - We'll take this right.

43:16.994 --> 43:20.797
 - This is Gulf Niner Whiskey,
      we're breaking off.
      Thanks for the tow.

43:20.799 --> 43:23.132
     - Pete, anywhere here.

43:32.710 --> 43:35.211
       - Who is that guy?
   - He's called The Cleaner.

43:35.213 --> 43:38.681
 He's the bravest man I've ever
 known. My greatest ally here.

43:38.683 --> 43:41.384
  He works for us but can't be
   seen with us, if you know
          what I mean.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.620
   His family's up in Kabul,

43:43.622 --> 43:46.222
    and he hasn't seen them
    or slept in the same bed

43:46.224 --> 43:48.691
 more than three nights running
     in the last two years.

43:48.693 --> 43:51.761
     - Why is he doing it?

43:51.763 --> 43:54.831
              - Love of country?
          I honestly don't know.

43:54.833 --> 43:57.934
               Can't just be for
           the money we pay him.

44:50.988 --> 44:55.291
       - Salaam Alaikum.
       - Alaikum Salaam.

45:24.354 --> 45:26.355
              - He says his name
                    is Mohammed.

45:26.357 --> 45:30.860
        - Yeah, of course it is.
     This bread looks very good.

45:34.498 --> 45:38.334
       My friend, Ryan.
     We have been friends,

45:38.336 --> 45:42.739
we have known each other
and loved each other
for many, many years.

45:42.741 --> 45:45.408
        And you helped my friend
    in the village of Haji Baba.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.084
And I would like to repay you
for that kindness.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.053
    Now you must need something?

45:57.055 --> 45:59.322
         Perhaps new prayer rugs
                for your mosque.

45:59.324 --> 46:02.125
 I would like to help with that.

46:08.932 --> 46:10.433
      - How much is that?
       - I have no idea.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.969
   This is for your village.

46:28.385 --> 46:32.822
- He says, "Only a fool accepts
    a gift without knowing
        what it's for."

46:37.327 --> 46:40.296
- There was a legendary warrior,
       a Mujahedeen in the Jihad

46:40.298 --> 46:43.132
     against the Soviets. He was
called 'The Lion of the Desert'.

46:55.913 --> 46:58.214
            - He says he's heard
                    of this man.

46:58.216 --> 47:02.585
   - The word is that he's back.
        He's once again mujahid.

47:02.587 --> 47:05.321
         Have you heard anything
            about these rumours?

47:16.400 --> 47:19.435
    May I ask where you're from?

47:26.476 --> 47:30.880
     - He says his village
    is called Abdullah Jan.
   - Ah, so you're Pakistani?

47:44.528 --> 47:46.929
        - "I've been a Pakistani
                 for many years,

47:46.931 --> 47:49.565
a Muslim for fourteen hundred
and a Pashtun for five
thousand."

47:49.567 --> 47:50.967
                 - I understand.

47:55.505 --> 47:58.274
            If you hear anything
                 about the Lion,

47:58.276 --> 48:00.476
                 I would greatly
                  appreciate it.

48:18.528 --> 48:22.098
      - So he's Pakistani?
             - No.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.001
       No, that was just
        a kind of test.

48:25.003 --> 48:28.571
     Abdullah Jan is just
   the ruins of some village

48:28.573 --> 48:31.274
       across the border
       from Spin Boldak.

48:31.276 --> 48:34.977
  Nobody's really lived there
  for a couple hundred years,
       least of all him.

48:34.979 --> 48:39.348
  - So he's not just some guy
        from a village.
        - No, he's not.

48:39.350 --> 48:41.684
  He's the Lion of the Desert.

48:41.686 --> 48:44.020
     That's what his people
          called him.

48:48.625 --> 48:53.095
 The Russians, they called him
    The Ghost because they
      couldn't kill him.

48:53.097 --> 48:56.999
   They shot him four times,
    they blew him up twice.

48:57.001 --> 48:59.268
         And each time,

48:59.270 --> 49:03.472
 his guys would get him up over
 the mountains and into the Red
    Cross tents in Pakistan.

49:03.474 --> 49:05.942
Then they'd get him stitched up

49:05.944 --> 49:09.145
   and he'd be back out there
blowing Russians out of the sky.

49:13.550 --> 49:15.551
  We just met a very big gun.

49:15.553 --> 49:18.454
              He's like a Rommel
                    or a Patton.

49:18.456 --> 49:22.959
 This guy beat the Red Army, and
    he was a kid when he did it.

49:22.961 --> 49:25.361
               When the Russians
                     pulled out,

49:25.363 --> 49:28.631
I'm going back to my grape
                         fields,

49:28.633 --> 49:31.133
           I don't want any part
       of your stupid civil war.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.102
            Just leave me alone.

49:33.104 --> 49:35.671
Which they did,
and it was kinda weird

49:35.673 --> 49:37.640
because generally speaking,

49:37.642 --> 49:40.676
  the Tallies went after anybody
who stood against them. But him,

49:40.678 --> 49:43.412
       for some reason they just
                 left him alone.

49:45.282 --> 49:47.650
      - But now he's back.
          - He's back,

49:47.652 --> 49:51.354
and I gotta figure out why.
A guy like him, with his
influence? He could prob--

50:09.306 --> 50:13.075
  - We have multiple bombers,
 vehicle borne and coordinated.
 Reporting civilian casualties,

50:13.077 --> 50:17.146
multiple CIV-KIA, city center--
   - Got a VD-IED Southwest
        Kandahar City.

50:17.148 --> 50:20.116
      Multiple casualties.
  - In AIR reports taking fire

50:20.118 --> 50:22.084
       at route one and
       alpha seven-five.

50:23.453 --> 50:26.455
        - Must have hit
       the engine block.
          - Goddamn.

50:26.457 --> 50:30.359
 - Peter, where is the convoy?
      We lost the convoy!

50:32.362 --> 50:36.732
- Zero, Golf Niner Whiskey.
-      I have contact. Over.

50:36.734 --> 50:38.701
  - Yeah, Golf Niner Whiskey.
        We have contact

50:44.675 --> 50:48.144
 - Zero, roger. Be advised we
have reports of multiple SBVIED

50:48.146 --> 50:50.413
     in vicinity of Police
 Headquarters. More to follow.

50:50.415 --> 50:52.615
Golf Niner Whiskey, send.

50:54.752 --> 50:58.421
I advise you, try and exit city,
   move to Camp Nathan Smith,
       ride this one out.

50:58.423 --> 51:01.824
- Golf Niner Whiskey. Wilco out.
   There's another explosion.
           Let's go.

51:01.826 --> 51:04.627
   We're gonna have to move,
          head north.

51:04.629 --> 51:08.397
Goddamn, I can't get the radio--
 - Forget the radio! We'll use
           my MBITER.

51:08.399 --> 51:11.801
   Let's go. We got to move.

51:17.074 --> 51:21.577
     - Fuck. I'm gonna have
          to blow it.
            - Walid?

51:21.579 --> 51:24.380
            - Yeah.
      - Come... come here.
        Behind the car.

51:27.717 --> 51:30.086
          - Frag out.

51:36.193 --> 51:38.494
- Mitchell, grab Walid.
Punch up to that corner,

51:38.496 --> 51:41.697
          cover my 6.
     - Roger. Stay with me.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.568
            - Clear.

51:45.570 --> 51:49.205
            - Dick.

51:52.476 --> 51:55.377
          - Let's go.

51:57.214 --> 52:00.382
         They're moving
    on the fucking rooftops.

52:04.688 --> 52:06.755
        Clear. Let's go.

52:09.626 --> 52:12.294
              RPG!

52:16.299 --> 52:19.401
           You good?
         - Yeah, good.

52:22.239 --> 52:25.374
       - Can you shoot?
   - Me? Fuck no. I'm intel.

52:28.211 --> 52:31.180
  - Zero, Golf Niner Whiskey.
I have PID on multiple hostiles,

52:31.182 --> 52:34.150
40 meters east of last position.
      Engaging. Wait out.

52:34.152 --> 52:37.620
         - Zero, roger.
           - Moving.
          - Covering.

52:47.931 --> 52:50.432
     - Target, one o'clock!

52:58.742 --> 53:01.277
     Target down! Mitchell,
         come up to me.

53:01.279 --> 53:03.646
          - Move it.
         - Go, go, go!

53:04.848 --> 53:08.617
           - Hold up!

53:08.619 --> 53:10.686
- I need you to punch left.

53:10.688 --> 53:14.557
      Down that alleyway.
   I'll cover you. You good?
      - Yeah, good to go.

53:14.559 --> 53:17.593
           - Standby.

53:17.595 --> 53:20.629
              Go!

53:30.807 --> 53:33.676
            - Clear!

53:33.678 --> 53:36.645
            - Clear.

53:36.647 --> 53:40.416
         - This is bad.

53:40.418 --> 53:44.587
    - You piss with the dick
       you got. Move it.

53:51.928 --> 53:56.465
    Changing mags. Cover me.
          - Covering.

53:59.269 --> 54:01.337
           - Moving.

54:05.375 --> 54:09.545
     - Rooftop, 9 o'clock.

54:21.358 --> 54:23.926
             Clear.

54:39.309 --> 54:42.411
         - Shoot him.
     - I don't shoot kids.

54:54.758 --> 54:56.859
            - Clear.
            - Clear.

55:03.400 --> 55:07.636
  - No, no. It's my guy. It's
   my guy. It's The Cleaner.
        Go, go, go, go.

55:22.452 --> 55:25.354
    Haji, where did you get
          this truck?

55:25.356 --> 55:28.490
          - My uncle!
          - Of course.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.559
- I hung around, you never know
       about this city.

55:30.561 --> 55:33.996
   I heard the gunfire. Came
 looking for you. We got lucky!

55:37.902 --> 55:41.937
  - Zero acknowledge. Goddamn.

55:49.412 --> 55:51.880
     - Can you get that in
         to Armstrong?

55:51.882 --> 55:54.717
Ho, ho, ho. That was balls out,

55:54.719 --> 55:56.919
   flat-out fucking insanity.

55:56.921 --> 55:59.455
Five suicide bombers,

55:59.457 --> 56:02.691
a rack of RPGs,
17 dead, 37 wounded.

56:02.693 --> 56:05.494
     I gotta get a coffee.
       - Do we know what
       they were after?

56:05.496 --> 56:09.732
- Yeah. Police Headquarters. We
 just got caught up in it. And
 that is Kandahar Karma, baby,

56:09.734 --> 56:13.469
 that's what that is. And I got
 to say you handled your rifle

56:13.471 --> 56:15.838
like you got ice in your veins.

56:15.840 --> 56:19.475
 - All those Tallies were using
  AKs, which is a great weapon
  if you're in a phone booth.

56:19.477 --> 56:22.811
You work the city a lot?

56:22.813 --> 56:26.749
      - A fair bit, yeah.
     - You got a weird job.

56:26.751 --> 56:29.551
- Oh yeah, and... and you don't?

56:29.553 --> 56:31.520
           - Me? No.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.522
 No, everybody knows the rules:

56:33.524 --> 56:35.924
  you pick up an AK, an RPG,
  you're gonna hear about it.

56:35.926 --> 56:38.527
     There's no grey area.

56:38.529 --> 56:41.730
 - Well, except back home where
  they think what you do is a
  little too... I don't know--

56:41.732 --> 56:45.067
   premeditated. But my shit?

56:45.069 --> 56:47.102
       Hearts and Minds?
    They lap that stuff up.

56:47.104 --> 56:50.038
  It's got a moral ring to it,
  even if it's mostly just PR.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.940
      - You believe that?

56:51.942 --> 56:54.910
            - These people here?

56:54.912 --> 56:58.447
        They got no use for what
               we have on offer.

56:58.449 --> 57:00.983
  They don't want Justin Bieber,
               or Tom Jefferson,

57:00.985 --> 57:03.452
     or our fucking pornography.

57:03.454 --> 57:06.789
    They just want our money and
      a little bit of stability.

57:06.791 --> 57:09.792
      - So how do we win?
     - There is no winning.

57:09.794 --> 57:12.494
   There's just an end state and
      that's gonna get laid down

57:12.496 --> 57:14.530
   by foreign policy, not by us.

57:14.532 --> 57:16.465
- You're a cynical man.

57:16.467 --> 57:19.535
       - Not about this country,
                        I'm not.

57:19.537 --> 57:23.472
    Not about these people.
         - Me neither.

57:23.474 --> 57:26.208
    And I gotta believe that
   if I put a 6-dollar round,

57:26.210 --> 57:28.877
        just one bullet
      in the right place,

57:28.879 --> 57:31.146
   I could change everything.

57:31.148 --> 57:35.150
      - You may be right.

57:35.152 --> 57:39.221
- You gonna
stick around at Sper?

57:39.223 --> 57:41.824
   - No, I'm gonna hop a flight.
            Should grab my gear.

57:41.826 --> 57:43.892
       I'll be in touch.

57:43.894 --> 57:46.862
       - I'll be around.

58:03.046 --> 58:05.914
Don't say anything, just listen.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.983
     I know our situation.
 I know it doesn't make sense.

58:07.985 --> 58:11.153
   But you need to hear this
     from me. I love you.

58:11.155 --> 58:15.591
 Right down to the bone, right
 down to the goddamned fucking
 marrow. You need to know that.

58:15.593 --> 58:19.761
             - Ditto. All of it.

58:26.569 --> 58:30.272
  - Haji, what are you doing?
    - Cleaning the chairs.

58:30.274 --> 58:33.642
      - It's not your job.
    - Well, whose job is it?
     - Well, it's nobody's.

58:33.644 --> 58:36.245
         - This is why
     you have dirty chairs.

58:36.247 --> 58:39.114
  - I need some tea. Come on.

58:39.116 --> 58:43.252
Why would he even agree
to a meeting if he has
absolutely nothing to say?

58:43.254 --> 58:45.854
           - Maybe he just wants
           the coalition to know
                 that he's back.

58:45.856 --> 58:49.558
- Maybe, but for what?

58:49.560 --> 58:52.561
We need to know
who's in that village.

58:52.563 --> 58:55.163
Can you get into the Tazkera
Registry, find out
who lives there?

58:55.165 --> 58:58.934
  - I have an uncle, he works
   in the Governor's Palace.

58:58.936 --> 59:01.136
- God, how many uncles
do you have?

59:01.138 --> 59:04.873
- Many.
           Tell me...

59:06.876 --> 59:10.279
 What do you think of my hair?
 I've been using the shampoo.

59:10.281 --> 59:13.815
- It looks silky smooth
and very manageable.

59:13.817 --> 59:16.118
        - And my hands?

59:16.120 --> 59:18.687
- Soft. Like a baby's bum.

59:18.689 --> 59:22.591
- You're the best.

59:41.678 --> 59:44.913
- Hey there, Chewey.

59:44.915 --> 59:46.848
I need a favour.

59:46.850 --> 59:49.318
I'm looking at a village
at this grid marker,

59:49.320 --> 59:53.322
any events in the last, I don't
know, say the last six months.
       - Come on, Pete--

59:53.324 --> 59:56.892
 - I know, I should go through
Armstrong, but I don't even know
 what I'm actually looking for.

59:56.894 --> 59:59.227
 And I don't feel like doing a
 whole work-up just on a hunch.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:03.732
 - You want a visual, I assume.
  - Anything with eyes, yeah.
      - I'll let you know.

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:07.169
          - Thank you.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:36.064
       - Anything useful?
            - Maybe.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:38.734
       What do I owe you?

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.903
- I'll take your beer allotment
   at the end of the month.
- I only get two, same as you.

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:44.873
   - And I'll take them both.
   - Alright, they're yours.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:49.177
And you can clear all this shit
off. Thanks, Chewey.

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:54.116
               Oh, yeah, and one
                  of these days,

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:56.251
              I'm gonna spool up
                  a fire mission

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:58.654
       and train my triple seven
               on your backside.

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.761
            - Okay.

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.298
          - Hey, Haji.
      What you got for me?

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.168
 - Oh, it's bad. It's Bashir's.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.737
      - You're kidding me.
      BDK owns that land?

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:17.773
You're sure?

01:01:17.775 --> 01:01:20.942
 - Alright, listen, can you get
     out to Sper tomorrow?

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:23.679
- Yes, no problem.
   -

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:26.448
   you're just a contractor
   working on a school or...

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.784
    I don't know, a fucking
   kite factory or something.

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:32.120
            - Okay.
    - Take care, my friend.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:45.133
 - Have you had any tenderness
  in your breasts, or nausea,

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.836
     or just the spotting?
    - No, just the spotting.

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:50.272
 I'm really managing my cycle.

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:52.974
    I haven't had my period
        in six months.

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:55.744
      I don't know, maybe
     I missed a pill or...

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:58.413
 maybe I'm just being paranoid.
            - Yeah.

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:01.249
     If we find something,

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:05.220
    what do we do? You know
   I'm supposed to report it.
 - Well. I'm asking you not to.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.489
              As a friend, okay?

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.860
           - Oh, my.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:30.178
         - Oh, my God.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:37.419
            Okay...

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:39.981
- How's Joey?

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:47.522
    - Oh, come on, honestly?

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:51.827
He really misses me?
  -

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:57.065
- I miss you, too, baby.

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:59.501
    - A "wide open prairie"
           miss you.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.875
- Oh, Jesus,

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:09.277
       you have no idea
     how much I miss them.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.948
            Hang on.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:38.406
- I had to go back because this
op was pretty early in the roto,

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:42.510
but the DETs observed
between 15 and 20 Tallies
moving across the field.

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.980
   Because of the force size,
      they didn't engage.

01:04:44.982 --> 01:04:48.516
 Company command requested the
   grid. They called it in,
        artillery beat

01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:51.019
     the shit out of them.
   - There was some fast air
   in there as well, right?

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:53.622
     - Yeah, I believe so.
       He had two A10s.
- And they destroyed the field?

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:55.891
  - That's what Wart Hogs do.

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:59.461
- Well, see, this matters
because, as it turns out,

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:02.063
the field is "owned"
by Bashir Daoud Khan.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:05.166
            - BDK?
  - See, BDK leases the field

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:09.471
to the farmer who's basically...
       he's like a slave, right?

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:12.374
  The farmer works the field,
    and then at the end of
       the poppy season,

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:15.644
he's got to hand over 5,000 USD.

01:05:15.646 --> 01:05:18.046
Whatever he gets on top of that
       he gets to keep,

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:20.248
   which is probably, like,
  800 bucks, somewhere around
     the national average.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:24.653
 Now, in this particular case,
    the Tallies go running
       around the field,

01:05:24.655 --> 01:05:27.555
 ISAF blows the shit out of it,

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:31.626
and the crop is ruined. And now,
well, the farmer, he's got less
  than Adam before the apple.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:35.096
  Well, BDK shows up and says,
 "Hello, where's my 5,000 USD?"

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:38.934
  And the farmer says, "Well,
 the crop was ruined, you know?
      No fault of my own."

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:42.037
    BDK says, "I don't give
       a shit, I'm evil.

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:46.074
 I will have my 5,000 dollars.
And you have 'x' amount of time
     to come up with it."

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:48.443
  - Wow, this guy sounds like
         Tony Soprano.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:51.279
      - Yeah. But without
        the therapist.
         - We Afghans,

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.214
 we're not very big on therapy.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:58.987
    - Alright, so why are we
    looking at this farmer?
   - His name is Abdul Malik.

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:02.624
His father's name is Haji Malik.
      Lion of the Desert.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:06.728
   - His father is The Ghost?
           Holy shit.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:10.598
- And we think this is why The
Ghost has returned-- to protect
   the honour of his family.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.501
- And there's some bad history
between BDK and The Ghost.

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:15.737
Now, I don't want things
to go haywire because
I want The Ghost.

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:18.106
I want him to work with us
because he could be

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:20.308
a powerful ally for what we're
trying to achieve down here.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.611
      Maybe we'll actually
        get Hyena built.
    - So, where do I fit in?

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:26.614
- Well, we think the date
for payment is close, yeah?

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:30.085
Two, three days, kinda thing.
So I need eyes on that village.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:33.488
I need to know about the comings
and goings, the who, the what--
all that kind of thing.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.992
     - Alright. I got my snipers
        spread all over the area
                   of operation.

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:39.094
          But I could re-deploy,
               rotate the DETs--

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:42.263
 two days on, two days off, sort
     of thing. Starting tonight.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:44.599
- Outstanding!

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.637
     - You ever try a date?
        - No, thank you.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:53.541
  - ¶¶ Baby, please don't go ¶

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:58.113
   ¶ Baby, please don't go ¶

01:06:58.115 --> 01:07:01.649
¶ You got dimples in your jaw ¶

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:05.453
¶ You got dimples in your jaw ¶

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:07.756
¶ You got dimples in your jaw ¶

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:10.692
      ¶ And that ain't all
   So baby, please don't go ¶

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:14.496
        - Comms check?
        - Check. Check.

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:17.799
     - Comms check to Wilf?
      - Check. Roger you.

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.801

           - Check.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:22.504
   - So you guys are gonna be
     dropped off somewhere

            - Check.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.276
    - You guys make your way

        - AKA Douchebag?

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:31.379
   - ¶ Hey-hey, little girl ¶

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:34.816
       ¶ Hey, little girl
     Hey-hey, little girl ¶

       ¶ Hey, little girl

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:43.691
    ¶ Hey-hey, little girl ¶

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:47.495
    ¶ Hey-hey, little girl ¶

    ¶ Baby, please don't go

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:17.625
   ¶ Baby, please don't go ¶

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:20.728
   ¶ Baby, please don't go ¶¶

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:11.145
- Brr!!

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:29.631
  - You seeing anything, Tank?
          - Negative.
    - Alright, take a break.

01:09:29.633 --> 01:09:32.300
                   - Roger that.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:35.837
         - Hey, Putts?

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:43.545
       Is there something
       you wanna tell me?

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:48.349
 Perry Como? In a combat zone?

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.885
      - It was on shuffle.
        - Unacceptable.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:54.722
Completely inappropriate.

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:24.786
  - You know, I've been thinking
    about what you said about...

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:27.288
            changing everything,
      you know, with one bullet.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:30.291
                      You really
                   believe that?

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:34.529
    - Yeah, I believe that.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.898
      I'm here, aren't I?
            - Yeah.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.702
                           Yeah.

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:42.804
        - Look at this.

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:49.544
- Okay, what the fuck is this?

01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:51.679
- I'm a terrible dancer.

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:55.016
        - You're an unbelievably
                     bad dancer.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:57.785
    - But I'm a great shot.
     And I've always been.

01:10:57.787 --> 01:11:00.521
    Ever since I was a kid.

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:02.890
It might have been irresponsible
  to put a weapon in my hand,

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:05.560
  but people would get hunting
     licences -they didn't
        even have a gun-

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:07.562
   just so that I could hunt
       on their behalf.

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:11.266
I used to shoot hard
to shoot game. Put food
on people's tables

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:14.402
     when times were hard--
     - Sir, Captain Boland
     wants to see you both.

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:17.438
                 - We're on.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:30.618
 - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha.
          Send. Over.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.022
  - 66 Bravo. We got a convoy
    heading our way. Over.

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:40.728
       - 66 Bravo, three
       white Suburbans,

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:43.698
  coming in fast-- looks like
  they're up-armoured. Over.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.000
  - Three Niner Alpha, what's
   happening in the village?

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.673
- 66 Bravo, all is quiet. Over.

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:54.709
- They're not ready,
they got no... Goddamn it.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.784
 - Okay, what's going on here?
      - I don't know yet.

01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:06.788
        Get everyone up.
            - Roger.

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:09.657
     - Holy shit. 66 Bravo,

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:12.360
   we've got two VIPs exiting
   the vehicle. First, 40's,

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:15.029
    black hair, bad dye job,
       beady little eyes.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:17.532
- Can he confirm VIP is BDK?

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:21.402
 - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha.
  Is VIP BDK? Can you confirm?

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:25.807
    - 66 Bravo, confirming.
VIP call sign Bravo Delta Kilo.

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:28.810
 Second civ, Hamid Walid Khan.

01:12:28.812 --> 01:12:32.613
 Call sign Hotel Whiskey Kilo.

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:35.883
       Three Niner Alpha,
       this is 66 Bravo.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:39.087
       We've got Taliban,
         counting four.

01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:43.658
  - He's got Tallies with him?
  - A guy like BDK plays both
      sides of the fence.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.894
  - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha,
          do you have clearance?
      Are they carrying weapons?

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:50.365
- Wednesdays, Fridays, he's
with us. Tuesdays, Thursdays,
he's with the Tallies,

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:54.001
and on days off they're
    both running narcotics.

01:12:54.003 --> 01:12:56.804
     negative. No weapons.
    But they're in costume.

01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:59.407
 Black turbans, black man jams.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:02.877
 These guys are not even trying
  to hide who they are. Over.

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:25.633
66 Bravo. We have hostile action
       against civilians.

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.002
            - Three Niner Alpha.
         Clarify hostile action.

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:30.838
     - They're taking kids,
         little girls.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.940
- Three Niner Alpha. Do you have
     imminent threat? Over.

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:35.042
     - 66 Bravo. Negative.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:52.660
   Authorize to engage? I am
getting ready to take the shot.

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:54.929
- No, I'm stepping in.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:59.000
  66 Bravo, this is Golf Niner
   Whiskey. Sit tight. Over.
        - What the fuck?

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:02.203
        Take them down!
- Unless they pull out weapons,
    we can't get involved.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:05.139
  - 66 Bravo. I can intervene.

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:08.876
- Golf Niner Whiskey. Negative.
   Unless you see a weapon,
       do not intervene.

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:12.046
      - 66 Bravo. They are
      taking little kids.

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:14.215
- - 66 Bravo.

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:17.084
       Clarify. Are you
      fucking kidding me?

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:20.555
  - Golf Niner Whiskey. Unless
you see a weapon, do not engage.

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:22.590
    - We gotta do something!
  - Your guys will stand down!

01:14:22.592 --> 01:14:24.759
        - Jesus Christ!
    - Settle down, Warrant.

01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:27.528
             Fuck!

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:33.134
            - Fuck!

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.978
- Hey, you're out of line here!
  - Why didn't you override?

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.048
     - Because it's an intel op,
 it's their call. It's the rules
of engagement and you know that!

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:50.017
    - It's a fucking crime!
    - Hey, we need to talk.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:53.221
- No, you know what, we're good.
   We're good. Hey, Mitchell.

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:56.157
What are those girls,
like, 8, 10 years old? Huh?

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.893
 And we just stand there? What's
   going to happen to them, huh?

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:01.629
        - They're gonna be sold,
     that's what's gonna happen.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:04.999
         BDK will hand them over
     to the Tallies. The Tallies
    will put them on the market.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:08.970
    Whatever they get above five
  they're going to keep, but BDK
     will get his 5,000 dollars.

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:12.673
 And then, I don't know, they're
     gonna end up in some shitty
              marriage in Dubai.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.176
  Or worse, they're gonna end up
    sucking dick in some brothel

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.678
       outside of Fort McMurray.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.680
- You know this
and we don't intervene?

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.149
   - We didn't intervene because
 we didn't have imminent threat.

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:25.052
             Those are the rules
            of engagement. I had
              to make that call.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:28.623
 And we didn't intervene because
      BDK is protected by a roof
                 on top of which

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:32.527
is a great big fucking sign that
 reads "CIA." He's their asset.

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:35.096
  Now, if you want to bring down
         our General and fuck up
        the entire battle group,

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:37.732
          be my guest, go ahead,
                      shoot him.

01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:41.736
   - What kind of fucking war
     are we fighting here?
- Oh, come on, it's not one war.

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:45.706
 It's a whole bunch of different
       wars. And mine, it's like
                a 3D chess game.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.742
 Half the time I don't even know
        who the fuck I'm playing
                        against.

01:15:47.744 --> 01:15:51.646
- We're not
playing games here!

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.681
                - No, we're not.

01:15:53.683 --> 01:15:55.883
      But we're not here so kids
           can fly kites either.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:59.287
      - Then what the fuck
       are we doing here?
- We are rolling back the clock.

01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:03.658
 And we are stacking the deck so
  this time the complete fuckin'
              crazies don't win.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:07.094
 Haji, did you get all of that?
  - Yes, the relay was clear.

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:12.099
  He's going to have to react.

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:14.101
      He will make Badal.

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:17.104
  - Okay, Badal is another one

01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:20.708
   of those tribal pillars.
It's like... Come on, sit down.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:24.579
           Sit down.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:29.684
    Badal basically means, like,

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:32.153
 revenge or... it's like "an eye
      for an eye" kind of thing.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:34.622
   - It's more about honour.
         If the leader

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:38.893
  of the family cannot restore
      honour to them, then
     he must leave forever.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:41.762
        So The Ghost has
    no choice. He must act.
    - Now, here's the thing:

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:45.032
   BDK served under The Ghost in
   the war against the Russians.

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:47.368
   The story goes that a Russian
               chopper went down

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.870
               and BDK ass-raped
              one of the pilots.

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:53.074
    And as punishment, The Ghost
        embarrassed him in front
         of the rest of the Muj.

01:16:53.076 --> 01:16:56.911
- So, you see, Badal continues.
- BDK is a bad guy and he needs

01:16:56.913 --> 01:17:01.282
             to be brought down.
        Now, we can't do it. But
      The Ghost can. To do that,

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.651
   we gotta boost the stature of
The Ghost. And we're gonna start

01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:06.253
        by inviting The Ghost to
    the ceremony for Hyena Road.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:10.024
      - Put them together?
       Badal is possible.

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:13.094
       - I'm also gonna offer up
         the safe house. If they
             meet on Hyena Road,

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:15.930
it's political. If they meet at
the safe house, it's personal.

01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:17.999
      Either way, there's
      gonna be fireworks.

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:20.801
 Okay, there's a flight heading
      back to KAF in about
         10, 11 mikes.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.870
      I'm gonna hop on it.
        Now, I need you

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:25.306
             to set up a meeting
           with The Ghost. We'll
        do it at the safe house.

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:27.775
            And I need your team
           to scope out security

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:30.211
            at the ceremony site
          and at the safe house.

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:35.683
                Ryan. Ryan...

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.788
        Don't think I don't feel
   for those girls, 'cause I do.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:43.691
        And we'll do what we can
                   to find them.

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:48.195
    But right now, in the bigger
     picture, we need The Ghost.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:51.158
              ¶¶¶

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:38.265
     - Travis said you were
        looking for me.
            - Yeah.

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:42.403
     - Alright, look, I'm sorry.
                 I lost my shit.

01:20:44.105 --> 01:20:47.374
   But you know me. And you know
          that most of the time,

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:50.444
 I'm proud about what we do here
         and I'm proud about how
           we go about doing it,

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:52.413
         but... those were kids.

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:57.284
      And if we can't help them,
             what's the point of
                 doing all this?

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:00.454
- I don't have
an answer for that,

01:21:00.456 --> 01:21:04.892
and for what it's worth,
I agree with you. But that's not
what I wanted to see you about.

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:09.864
Do you mind just
closing the door?

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:19.139
            Here...

01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:22.443
    Have a seat, I just have
     to show you something.

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:41.528
    - What's this?

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:44.598
          - Uh, that's our baby.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.135
         It was Cyprus, I guess.

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:59.313
- That's one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:07.321
The most beautiful thing.

01:22:07.323 --> 01:22:10.457
          - This kind of changes
             things, doesn't it?

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:13.160
- Yeah, it changes everything.

01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:15.529
  - I think that in terms of the
   brass we're going to be okay,

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:18.065
             because it happened
         while we were on leave,

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:21.402
     but we've got to figure out
            what we're gonna do.

01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:24.705
       - Figure out what
        we're gonna do?

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.610
We're gonna have a baby.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:33.347
        - Is that what you want?

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:40.087
- Yeah, of course it's
what I want. More than anything.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:43.257
         - Okay, good. I'm glad.

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:45.526
       - You know, you're
        making me crazy.

01:22:45.528 --> 01:22:49.096
                 - Yeah, I know,
        I'm making myself crazy.

01:22:49.098 --> 01:22:52.032
- What did you think I'd think?
 - I don't know, I just was...

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:55.202
     I was nervous. We didn't...

01:22:57.405 --> 01:23:00.140
...leave things very well.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:03.210
- Come here, come here.

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:05.245
We're gonna have a baby.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.520
You sure it's mine?

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:32.239
                  - Niner Niner,
                    TAC on base.

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:42.549
    - Cocks. Another IED hit
         out on Hyena.

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:46.487
  One KIA. A guy out of Kabul,
  father of how many, Shorty?

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:49.656
         - Five, sir.
         - Five. Fuck.

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:52.659
 Fighting these pricks is like
  nailing Jell-O to the wall.

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:57.498
  I cannot keep losing civilians
 if we're gonna get Hyena built,

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.635
 and if we're gonna prevail down
there, Hyena's gotta go through.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:04.338
I've gotta get out there,

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.340
    get on the ground, gotta get
         my Leopard II's rolling

01:24:06.342 --> 01:24:08.375
        and I've gotta blow them
      fuckers out of their beds.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:11.245
                 I've gotta find
           their weapons caches.

01:24:11.247 --> 01:24:13.647
      I've gotta fuck with their
            command and control,
            and I cannot do that

01:24:13.649 --> 01:24:14.448
         bouncing around goddamn
                    helicopters.

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:20.154
          Now that's the kinetic
  imperative, Pete. So I'm gonna
     need a little help from you

01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:23.290
   non-kinetic types. I need you
     effects guys to go in there
            and work your magic.

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:26.193
- Understood, sir,
and we are working on it.

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:29.663
My Afghan guy's telling me that
BDK is behind all of this shit.

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:32.699
The more the security situation
deteriorates, the more money
he's making

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:35.302
out of all the gravel trucks
and all the other stuff
he's into us for.

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:37.404
 - Fucking horrible little man.
        - If he was out

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.673
 of the picture, getting Hyena
    through would be a hell
       of a lot easier.

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:43.544
         - If he got knocked off
    his perch, I would not weep.

01:24:43.546 --> 01:24:46.680
      - Understood, sir.
  - I hear The Ghost is back.

01:24:46.682 --> 01:24:49.383
          - Yes, sir.
       - Is he a threat?

01:24:49.385 --> 01:24:52.519
- Just the opposite. I think
he could be a powerful ally.

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:55.255
   - I don't care how you do it,
     just make sure my civilians
              aren't getting hit

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:57.257
           every time they drive
     a fucking truck down there.

01:24:57.259 --> 01:25:00.227
       - Understood, sir.
        - Thanks, Pete.

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:13.340
           - Haji, what the fuck
                  are you doing?

01:25:13.342 --> 01:25:16.477
- What? You can't see
out of these things.

01:25:16.479 --> 01:25:20.114
   - There's nothing to see.
- No, not the way they are, no.

01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:24.251
       - Okay, get in touch with
   The Ghost. The meeting is on.

01:25:24.253 --> 01:25:27.254
      - You have approval?
      - It's always better

01:25:27.256 --> 01:25:30.224
     to ask for forgiveness than
      permission, you know that.

01:25:30.226 --> 01:25:33.560
                  We'll meet him
              at the safe house.

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:26.780
- This house is a key feature--
 it's our asset, a safe house.

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:29.383
    We'll set up our OP here

01:26:29.385 --> 01:26:31.451
         at the summit
    of the saddleback ridge.

01:26:31.453 --> 01:26:34.821
 And that'll give us clear line
     of sight to both sides
          of the hill.

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:37.191
    Here, at the safe house,

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:39.793
  and here, where the ceremony
    is going to take place.

01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:44.364
      - What's the range?
 - It's comfortable, 1150, 750
 meters both sides of the hill.

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:47.734
    - What about extraction?
      - We'll ex-fil down
         the back side,

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:51.338
 through the grape fields, and
 get picked up on route Hyena.

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:53.974
 - How's this house gonna play?

01:26:53.976 --> 01:26:55.642
       - That's unknown.

01:26:55.644 --> 01:26:58.879
     There's an offer out
 to The Ghost and BDK to show.

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:02.616
    Intel thinks they'll show up
        either at the safe house
             or at the ceremony.

01:27:02.618 --> 01:27:05.285
        So we need eyes on both.

01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:07.487
                Alright, this is
                    a tricky Op,

01:27:07.489 --> 01:27:11.692
        so I'll take lead. Wilf,
     you'll stand this one down.

01:27:11.694 --> 01:27:14.494
    Alright, let's gear up.

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.565
- I would like to thank you
for meeting with me.

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.771
- He says,
"The honour is mine."

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:40.887
He says, "I'm surprised
to be here. I used to come
to this house many times."

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:45.325
  He's asking you, do you know
  who used to own this house?
         - Mullah Omar.

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.402
- He saved his ears
but he lost his eye.

01:27:55.404 --> 01:27:59.273
     - What does that mean?
         - Same, same.
       - Same, same what?

01:27:59.275 --> 01:28:02.409
   - Same, same, same, same.

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:05.312
       - If you ever need to use
        this house, for whatever
             reason, it's yours.

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:13.720
 There was an event in Panjaway
   the other day, the village
         of Haji Baba.

01:28:13.722 --> 01:28:17.724
Two little girls were taken out
 of the arms of their father.

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:27.034
             - And he says, "Why
           have you come to me?"

01:28:27.036 --> 01:28:29.569
- Because the little
girls were taken

01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:32.639
by Bashir Daoud Khan.

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:38.879
My General is
a compassionate man.

01:28:38.881 --> 01:28:41.548
He's a student of Pashtunwali.

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:44.851
And he would like to help you,
to help all Afghans,

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:47.921
to help the village
of Haji Baba.

01:28:57.398 --> 01:29:00.734
 And he would be very honoured
 if you would accept this gift.

01:29:00.736 --> 01:29:03.537
   Five thousand US dollars.

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:09.109
He would also be honoured
if you would attend

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:12.479
the ceremony for Hyena Road.

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:25.125
         - He's saying, "Why me?
     I'm a simple grape farmer."

01:29:25.127 --> 01:29:27.527
- He understands this.

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:30.831
But your presence would do him
a great honour as an Elder
of the region.

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:37.671
  - "Who else will be there?"

01:29:37.673 --> 01:29:41.475
- Bashir Daoud Khan.

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:57.958
- "I have known this man,
Bashir, since he was a boy."

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:13.874
"He brought great dishonour
to our cause. And he was
punished by my own hands."

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:31.992
"Thank your General
for his kindness.

01:30:31.994 --> 01:30:36.062
And it will be
my honour to attend."

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:46.640
            He says that chicken
                      hates you.

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:54.448
  - Yeah, Haji, it's me. Yeah,

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:57.451
    I'm watching him walk up
    the side of a mountain.

01:30:57.453 --> 01:31:00.086
 Yeah, he says he's gonna show
 up, but I got the feeling he's
  got something up his sleeve,

01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:03.523
 so I'm gonna need you to get
 your eyes and ears out there,
 see what you can learn, okay?

01:31:03.525 --> 01:31:07.594
    Yeah. Wa Alaikum Salaam.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:12.833
   Okay, let's get our gear,
           we'll go.

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:28.648
- Whoa.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.784
                     Local meat?

01:31:30.786 --> 01:31:34.221
       - Heavenly Father,

01:31:34.223 --> 01:31:38.625
        please protect
      those little girls.

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:43.497
      And watch over them
      and bring them home.

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.519
  - Listen, I'm not sure I was
 entirely clear about all this,

01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:08.822
   so I want to spell it out.

01:32:08.824 --> 01:32:12.626
  I'd like it very much if...

01:32:12.628 --> 01:32:14.794
       if you'd marry me,
        Captain Bowman.

01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:18.164
- I would also
like that very much,

01:32:18.166 --> 01:32:21.801
Warrant Officer Sanders.

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:34.281
 - Okay, I've gotta go. We're
heading out. I've gotta get up.

01:32:34.283 --> 01:32:37.851
- Let me help you with that kit.

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:58.338
    We're crazy.

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:01.608
          - Fucking certifiable.

01:33:04.045 --> 01:33:06.880
- Be careful, okay.

01:33:06.882 --> 01:33:09.649
                    - I promise.

01:33:17.826 --> 01:33:21.094
               You're driving me
                          crazy.

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:54.060
          - Hey, Jenn.
             - Hey.

01:33:54.062 --> 01:33:56.763
  So how do you think this is
      going to play out?

01:33:56.765 --> 01:34:00.934
    - Hard to say, a lot of
 variables. If the plan holds,
 we're golden. Anything shifts,

01:34:00.936 --> 01:34:03.670
           who knows?
    - We got Niner Niner TAC
         en route now.

01:34:03.672 --> 01:34:07.007
 - Okay, everybody, here we go.
 General's on his way. You were
   down at the ceremony site?

01:34:07.009 --> 01:34:10.677
         - Yeah, on my way here;
              usual motley crew.

01:34:10.679 --> 01:34:14.147
          Goats everywhere. Shit
     all over the goddamn place.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:17.651
  You know what I'd like to see?
    I'd like to see this country
              host the Olympics.

01:34:17.653 --> 01:34:19.653
          That would be awesome!

01:34:19.655 --> 01:34:22.722

01:34:22.724 --> 01:34:24.958

   Niner Niner Tac in sight,
        one click out.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.349
    - I bet you not one VIP
      is gonna be there.

01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:52.686
    They're not gonna show.
- I think they'll be there, sir.

01:34:52.688 --> 01:34:56.423
    It's important to them.
    - Twenty-five bucks says
       they're a no-show.

01:34:56.425 --> 01:34:59.726
- You're on, sir.

01:34:59.728 --> 01:35:02.262
   - I love your enthusiasm,
            Shorty.

01:35:02.264 --> 01:35:05.398
             Fuck.

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:14.474
- Go, go, go. Move your ass now!

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:26.920
       - 66. Niner Niner,
    attach has landed. Over.

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:36.296
 - You're gonna owe me twenty-
 five bucks, you realize that,
          don't you?

01:35:36.298 --> 01:35:39.332
- I'm an optimist, sir.

01:35:39.334 --> 01:35:41.835
   - You're a fucking idiot,
            Shorty.

01:35:41.837 --> 01:35:44.404
- Roger that, sir.

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:58.785
    - Three Niner Alpha, 66.
     I have convoy in sight
    on approach road. Over.

01:35:58.787 --> 01:36:01.087

  - Okay, everybody, we're on.
      BDK's going for it.

01:36:21.076 --> 01:36:23.810
       The Ghost and BDK
  will meet at the safe house,

01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:27.313
not at the ceremony site.
So this is probably
gonna get personal.

01:36:27.315 --> 01:36:30.183
 You got that relayed at ASIC?
    - You're hooked up now,
        sir, go ahead.

01:36:30.185 --> 01:36:32.919
        - One One Zulu,

 - Golf Niner Whiskey, this is
 One One Zulu. You're in luck.

01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:44.798
  We got a high asset sitting
  on top of your grid marker.

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.300
     Running traps... now.

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:03.583

   - One One Zulu, Golf Niner
       Whiskey, negative.

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.527

     - What are you doing?
- He's turning their cell phones
    into listening devices.

01:37:17.532 --> 01:37:19.833
           But don't ask me how.
                 I have no idea.

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:24.838
   - One One Zulu, first trap
         coming at you.

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:33.479
   - One One Zulu, Golf Niner
   Whiskey, negative. You can
     drop that trap. Over.

01:37:33.481 --> 01:37:36.983

   Number two coming at you.

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:46.492

01:37:52.567 --> 01:37:55.268
   Thanks for your help. Out.

call sign Ghost is stepping out.

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:13.953
   Call sign Ghost is alone.

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:18.291
   - He shouldn't be alone.
 He should have guys with him.

01:38:18.293 --> 01:38:20.393
   - So what does that mean?

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:34.107
  - The Ghost says that Bashir
    has insulted the honour
         of his family.

01:38:34.109 --> 01:38:37.911
   For a young man, a former
 student, this is a great sin.

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:50.356
The Ghost says he has just given
 him five thousand US dollars.

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:55.495
   He says this will satisfy
   the question of the money.

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:06.072
    The Ghost says yes, but
 the debt is not yet resolved.

01:39:19.421 --> 01:39:22.989
- This is so fucked up.

01:39:22.991 --> 01:39:25.058
- Copy that.

01:39:33.535 --> 01:39:36.302
- His son? How the fuck
did I not have this intel?

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.480
    He says he wants his son
        returned to him.

01:39:47.482 --> 01:39:50.183
     He says that he wants
        to see his son.

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:59.692
'And so you shall'.

01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:17.043
- Jesus! Three Niner Alpha, 66.
        I have a head.

01:40:17.045 --> 01:40:20.246
     A human fucking head,
     lying on the ground.
            - Fuck!

01:40:21.582 --> 01:40:25.718
   - It's the son, call sign
      Hotel Whiskey Kilo.

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.621
      - Shit, shit, shit.
     BDK is going to react.

01:40:28.623 --> 01:40:32.125
          Okay, look,
     they must not engage.
    - 66, Three Niner Alpha.

01:40:32.127 --> 01:40:34.627
      What is BDK doing?
  Do you have hostile intent?

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.703
       - We got a weapon.
     - 66. Call sign Bravo
    Delta Kilo has a weapon.

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:47.473
   Hostile intent toward civ
       call sign Ghost.
     - Okay, light him up!

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:52.278
   - 66, Golf Niner Whiskey.
    Do not take that shot!

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.482
      - He has clearance!
- I'm overriding! 66, Golf Niner
Whiskey. You don't understand--

01:40:56.484 --> 01:40:59.752
       - 66. I understand
       imminent threat--
  - Hit him, for fuck's sakes!

01:40:59.754 --> 01:41:03.623
   - Am engaging. Wait out.
  - Confirm your dope. Up 23,

01:41:03.625 --> 01:41:05.391
           right 2--
           - Roger.

01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:08.094
- 66, Golf Niner Whiskey. Ryan,
please, do not take that shot--

01:41:08.096 --> 01:41:10.396
        - He has intent!
   He doesn't need your okay!

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:13.566
           - Standby.

01:41:19.307 --> 01:41:21.407
           - Send it.

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:30.316
          - Good hit.

01:42:17.732 --> 01:42:21.534
- Nine Niner Tac, on the move.

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:30.776
- Niner Niner Tac, exfilling
now. All birds in escort.

01:42:30.778 --> 01:42:34.147
   - 66, Golf Niner Whiskey.
     Do you have any idea
    what you've just done?

01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:36.182
   - 66. Yeah, I think I do.

01:42:36.184 --> 01:42:39.218
  I had imminent threat toward
   a civilian. I intervened.

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:42.155
- Yeah, you did intervene, 66,
and you intervened in something
    you know nothing about!

01:42:42.157 --> 01:42:45.558
- Back off, Mitchell.
66, Three Niner Alpha.
Continue to rendez-vous.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.494
     - You just fucked him!
 - You fight your war, Captain,
      and I'll fight mine.

01:42:50.732 --> 01:42:54.300
- I saved his life.

01:42:54.302 --> 01:42:57.637
 - It wasn't yours to save! Now
he's got nothing! You understand
     that? He has nothing!

01:42:57.639 --> 01:43:00.873
 - That's enough, Captain! This
  is my CP, you will back off.

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:05.878
       - Salaam Alaikum.

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:10.950
       - What's he doing?
        - I don't know.

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.387
    - Do you think he knows
    we just saved his bacon?

01:43:14.389 --> 01:43:18.658
   - I think it might be more
     complicated than that.
             - How?

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:21.194
     What could possibly--

01:43:21.196 --> 01:43:24.397
- Fuck!

01:43:27.968 --> 01:43:31.971
- The fuck did they come from?
- Guys from the safe house must
   have called for back-up.

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:37.543
    - Travis! Travis? Fuck!

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:40.980

  How many insurgents? Over.

01:43:54.696 --> 01:43:57.530

        - 66. Two-zero,
      three-zero hostiles.

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:03.636
 - The fuck did they come from?
 - How far away are the birds?

01:44:03.638 --> 01:44:06.239
- Ma'am, they are at least 30
minutes out. They moved back
to escort Niner Niner Tac.

01:44:06.241 --> 01:44:09.542
- Shit! Okay, get onto the TOC.
     Get a QRF rolling out
        of Massum Ghar.

01:44:09.544 --> 01:44:13.813

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:35.935

  <i> - Alexander the Great fought</i>
     <i> a counter-insurgency</i>
        <i> in Afghanistan</i>

01:54:22.489 --> 01:54:25.123
<i>that lasted almost three years.</i>

01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:28.393
 <i> And by the end of those years,</i>
   <i> he was drinking heavily</i>
   <i> and completely paranoid.</i>

01:54:28.395 --> 01:54:33.131
  <i> One night, he got into a row</i>
   <i> with a guy named Cleitus</i>
   <i> the Black, a loyal friend.</i>

01:54:33.133 --> 01:54:35.400
     <i> Cleitus accused him</i>
      <i> of certain things</i>

01:54:35.402 --> 01:54:38.036
     <i> and Alexander threw</i>
   <i> a spear into his heart.</i>

01:54:38.038 --> 01:54:41.073
 <i> As he watched his friend die,</i>
      <i> he lost his mind.</i>

01:54:41.075 --> 01:54:43.876
      <i> Five years later,</i>
     <i> Alexander was dead.</i>

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:51.884
    <i> As the Afghans say...</i>
   <i> You might have the clocks,</i>

01:54:51.886 --> 01:54:54.286
