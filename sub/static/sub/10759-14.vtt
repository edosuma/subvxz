WEBVTT

00:08.908 --> 00:10.977
Frasier, thank
God you're here.

00:10.977 --> 00:11.978
Why, what's wrong, Roz?

00:11.978 --> 00:12.979
My book club
meets tonight,

00:12.979 --> 00:13.980
and I haven't
read the book.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.983
Oh, my, that is
a literary 911.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.451
I know.

00:18.451 --> 00:21.354
Wait. You joined a book club?

00:21.354 --> 00:23.256
Why is that so
hard to believe?

00:23.256 --> 00:24.624
I like to read.

00:24.624 --> 00:25.325
What's his name?

00:25.325 --> 00:26.159
Jason.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.093
Uh-huh.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.495
We met at
a bookstore,

00:28.495 --> 00:29.929
and he asked me
to join his club.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.931
He's separated,
but I think it's for keeps.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.234
He was buying
Divorce for Dummies.

00:34.234 --> 00:37.003
Sounds like a real catch, Roz.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.005
Anyway, I was
supposed to read

00:39.005 --> 00:40.006
The Great Gatsby
 last night,

00:40.006 --> 00:41.508
but I couldn't get
Alice to sleep,

00:41.508 --> 00:43.009
so could you give
me a quick summary?

00:43.510 --> 00:44.878
Well, all right.

00:44.878 --> 00:49.049
Uh, it was a time known
as the Jazz Age.

00:50.650 --> 00:54.454
Wall Street was booming,
bootleg hooch was flowing,

00:54.454 --> 00:56.456
and the young people
were doing a new dance

00:56.456 --> 00:59.259
called the Charleston.

00:59.259 --> 01:00.060
Where were you
when I was trying

01:00.060 --> 01:01.561
to get Alice to sleep?

01:01.561 --> 01:02.962
Could you just get
to it already?

01:02.962 --> 01:05.364
Well, all right, fine.

01:05.364 --> 01:06.766
Lorna Lenley.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.069
Okay, who's she,
Gatsby's girlfriend?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.970
The woman
who just walked in.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.773
She was the great beauty
of my high school.

01:13.773 --> 01:16.776
She had brains, looks, style...

01:16.776 --> 01:18.778
and the way she filled out
a mohair sweater...

01:18.778 --> 01:19.779
well, suffice it to say,

01:19.779 --> 01:23.716
it was snugger on her
than on the goat.

01:23.716 --> 01:26.152
Why don't you go
over and say hello?

01:26.152 --> 01:28.555
Oh, God, Roz, she wouldn't
even remember me.

01:28.555 --> 01:29.956
She was with the in crowd.

01:29.956 --> 01:31.991
The only people who knew me
debated, recited

01:32.492 --> 01:34.494
or were on a six-month visit
from Abu Dhabi.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.730
Oh, God, she's coming over.
She's coming over!

01:37.730 --> 01:39.666
She's coming over!

01:39.666 --> 01:41.167
Excuse me.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.103
Didn't we go
to high school together?

01:43.103 --> 01:44.571
Did we?

01:44.571 --> 01:47.073
Yes. I thought
you looked familiar.

01:47.073 --> 01:48.408
You're Frasier,
aren't you?

01:48.408 --> 01:49.242
Well, that's right.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.744
Um... all right,
let me guess.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.547
Um... Lisa?

01:54.547 --> 01:55.348
Lorna.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.649
FRASIER:
Oh, yes, of course.

01:56.649 --> 01:58.184
Lorna, hello.

01:58.184 --> 02:01.821
Uh, Roz, I'd like you
to meet Lorna Anne Lenley.

02:01.821 --> 02:05.024
Was that... anywhere close?

02:05.024 --> 02:05.925
Wow, very good.

02:05.925 --> 02:07.393
Although it's
Gardener now,

02:07.393 --> 02:08.428
but I'm going back
to Lenley.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.263
I was just recently
divorced.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.098
Oh, gosh,
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.467
Roz, our chatting isn't, uh,

02:14.467 --> 02:15.335
bothering your reading,
is it?

02:15.335 --> 02:16.703
Oh, no. Actually, I...

02:16.703 --> 02:18.104
Oh, right.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.607
Off I go.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.610
So, uh, I-I'm divorced
myself, actually.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.611
Yes, I know that.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.512
I listen to your show.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.846
Really?

02:26.846 --> 02:27.714
Well, I sell
real estate,

02:27.714 --> 02:28.715
so I'm in my
car all the time,

02:28.715 --> 02:30.650
so whenever I can,
I turn you on.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.354
Oh, my.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.121
(phone ringing)

02:35.121 --> 02:36.122
Oh, that's me.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.457
Excuse me, I
have to get that.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.325
No problemo.

02:43.696 --> 02:44.697
Roz...

02:44.697 --> 02:47.600
she's just as lovely as ever.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.902
So, you going
to ask her out?

02:48.902 --> 02:50.236
Oh, right.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.504
"Legs" Lenley and
Crane "The Brain."

02:51.971 --> 02:53.339
In my dreams.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.574
Frasier, you act

02:54.574 --> 02:56.643
like you're still
some gawky teenager.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.012
You're a charming,
successful man.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.346
Well, thank you, Roz.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.715
No problemo.

03:03.883 --> 03:05.685
Excuse me.
I-I have to go show a house.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.187
Frasier, it was really nice
to see you again.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.589
Oh, likewise.

03:09.589 --> 03:10.423
Uh, Lorna, listen,

03:10.423 --> 03:13.426
I-I realize that, uh,
this is out of the blue

03:13.426 --> 03:14.460
and that you're very busy,

03:14.460 --> 03:18.398
but I was wondering
if you might like to, uh...

03:18.398 --> 03:20.200
Yes?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.069
...appraise my apartment.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.505
See, I've decided to sell it.

03:26.839 --> 03:28.107
Sure. Be happy to.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.210
In fact, I'm free tonight.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.511
Really? Uh, well, how's 7:00?

03:31.511 --> 03:33.379
Uh, I live
at the Elliott Bay Towers.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.048
Oh, wow, what a great building.

03:35.048 --> 03:35.882
Yes, well...

03:35.882 --> 03:36.883
You've certainly done well
for yourself.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.384
Yes, well, I think

03:38.384 --> 03:39.385
you'll find that
we've both come

03:39.385 --> 03:40.887
a long way since
high school.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.189
Oh, you know, here, let me...
let me carry those for you.

03:43.189 --> 03:44.924
Oh. Thank you.

03:52.131 --> 03:53.132
Dad, she'll be here
any minute.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.668
MARTIN:
Okay, okay, I'm leaving.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.637
Listen, I'm sorry
to uproot you like this.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.072
It's just...
Oh, it's all right.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.974
I'd rather clear the decks
for a date

04:00.974 --> 04:03.276
than for one
of your theme parties.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.511
Although I am
kind of sorry

04:05.511 --> 04:07.814
I missed an evening
with Moe Howard.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.017
That was Noel Coward.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.452
(doorbell ringing)

04:12.952 --> 04:14.887
Oh, hey.
Hey, Dad.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.723
Oh, Niles, what are
you doing here?

04:16.723 --> 04:17.656
Well, I've got a crisis.

04:17.656 --> 04:18.658
Uh, tomorrow's Mel's birthday,

04:18.658 --> 04:20.159
and I'm planning
a very romantic evening,

04:20.159 --> 04:21.995
but my Gaggenau is on the fritz.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.329
Oh, geez, I don't need
to hear this.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.298
No, Dad...

04:25.298 --> 04:27.166
it's a stove.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.101
I know. Six burners
and a griddle.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.403
Don't you guys ever talk
about cars?

04:33.006 --> 04:34.240
Frasier, I'm desperate.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.775
Can I possibly use
your kitchen tomorrow

04:35.775 --> 04:37.610
to prepare the meal?
Yes, of course, Niles,

04:37.610 --> 04:38.411
but, listen,
now you-you've got to go.

04:38.411 --> 04:39.646
I have a date.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.481
Oh?

04:41.481 --> 04:42.882
Anyone I know?

04:42.882 --> 04:44.784
As a matter of fact, yes.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.185
Lorna Lenley.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.956
Oh! No, really, who?

04:49.956 --> 04:52.692
No, it's true. I-I bumped
into her today at the cafe.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.127
Lorna Lenley?
Mm-hmm.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.095
You, sir, have moxie.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.964
Well...

04:57.964 --> 04:59.365
Why, even with all
my vested authority

04:59.365 --> 05:00.833
as hall monitor,
I could never muster

05:00.833 --> 05:02.869
the courage to ask to see
her bathroom pass,

05:02.869 --> 05:03.836
and you asked her out?

05:03.836 --> 05:05.738
Well...

05:05.738 --> 05:08.608
I bow down before you.
I doff my cap to you.

05:09.108 --> 05:09.976
Well, actually, it's...

05:09.976 --> 05:10.810
it's not really a date.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.313
I knew it.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.248
You see, she's coming over
to appraise the apartment.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.749
She's in real estate.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.619
I tried to ask her
out and I choked.

05:19.619 --> 05:20.953
I did get the impression

05:20.953 --> 05:22.755
that she was interested
in me, though.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.557
Well, of course she is.
Oh, and the coach called.

05:24.557 --> 05:27.427
You're starting
the big game on Sunday.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.329
That's very funny, Niles.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.563
All right, off you go, now.
Come on.

05:30.563 --> 05:31.364
No, I want to see Lorna.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.865
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, Niles, no.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.367
You have to go.
(doorbell ringing)

05:34.367 --> 05:35.668
Is that her?

05:35.668 --> 05:37.236
She's here.
All right, okay, okay.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.538
But, look...

05:38.538 --> 05:40.039
you get one quick hello,

05:40.039 --> 05:42.041
and then you're gone,
mister.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.545
Hello, Frasier.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.546
Lorna, good to see you again.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.548
Uh, perhaps you remember
my brother Niles.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.482
Yes, hello, Niles.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.190
Well, now that you two
have had a chance to catch up,

05:57.190 --> 05:58.157
I'll see you later, Niles.

05:58.157 --> 05:59.492
Nice to see you again, Niles.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.294
(chuckling)

06:04.697 --> 06:07.200
Oh, Frasier, wow!

06:07.200 --> 06:08.701
What a great apartment.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.702
FRASIER:
Thank you.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.571
Why are you selling it?

06:11.571 --> 06:13.473
Oh, I don't want to bore you
with the details.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.843
It's a very long,
very complicated story.

06:16.843 --> 06:17.877
I'd love to hear it.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.213
Uh, well...

06:20.213 --> 06:24.016
I need more closet space.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.652
Could I interest you
in some wine?

06:26.652 --> 06:28.154
Oh, I would love some.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.055
Ah.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.694
Do you remember Chip Clayton's
graduation party?

06:34.694 --> 06:36.696
Remember, we broke into
his father's liquor cabinet

06:36.696 --> 06:40.266
and we made sangria
out of a $100 bottle of wine?

06:40.266 --> 06:41.033
(chuckles)

06:41.033 --> 06:43.870
Thank you.
No.

06:43.870 --> 06:44.871
You know what?

06:44.871 --> 06:46.205
I should make
some notes

06:46.205 --> 06:47.407
on your apartment.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.144
FRASIER:
What are you doing?

06:51.144 --> 06:52.145
Tell her why
you really asked her over

06:52.145 --> 06:54.147
and drop
this ridiculous charade.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.583
You're not 16 years old
any longer.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.886
Frasier, I'd love
to see your bedroom.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.288
Of course.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.726
Lorna Lenley wants
to see my bedroom!

07:10.696 --> 07:13.699
Oh, Frasier, wow,
another great room.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.201
Thank you.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.203
Is this bed
Scandinavian?

07:17.203 --> 07:20.072
You have a good eye.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.941
Lorna Lenley's on my bed!

07:22.375 --> 07:24.944
Stop acting like an adolescent!

07:24.944 --> 07:27.914
Frasier, are you all right?

07:28.881 --> 07:30.883
No.

07:30.883 --> 07:34.353
No, actually, Lorna,
I'm not all right. Uh...

07:34.353 --> 07:36.322
you see, when I saw
you this afternoon,

07:36.322 --> 07:39.759
I immediately flashed back
to the hopeless crush

07:39.759 --> 07:41.260
I had on you in high school.

07:41.260 --> 07:44.230
Of course, it didn't
help matters much

07:44.230 --> 07:46.732
that you've
hardly changed a bit,

07:46.732 --> 07:52.004
and I wanted to ask you out
and I-I lost my nerve.

07:52.004 --> 07:54.307
You mean, all of this

07:54.307 --> 07:55.775
was just a ruse
to get me up here?

07:55.775 --> 07:57.543
I'm afraid so.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.879
So now that I've sufficiently
embarrassed myself,

07:59.879 --> 08:01.681
I'll show you out.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.520
You know, Frasier,
I have to say,

08:07.520 --> 08:10.056
I'm really
very flattered.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.457
Really?

08:11.457 --> 08:13.392
Yes.

08:13.392 --> 08:16.162
You know, it's not too late
to ask me out.

08:16.162 --> 08:19.298
Would you like to have dinner
with me this evening?

08:19.298 --> 08:21.100
I'd love to.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.070
Wonderful.

08:25.071 --> 08:28.541
I'm going out
with Lorna Lenley!

08:45.558 --> 08:46.726
Hi.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.628
Hi.

08:50.129 --> 08:53.132
Mm, I had a wonderful
time last night.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.567
Me, too.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.968
It was like being back
in high school...

08:56.469 --> 08:57.470
but with sex.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.472
(laughing)

09:02.141 --> 09:04.577
Oh, I don't want
this to end.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.012
I must warn you,
now that I've learned

09:06.012 --> 09:07.513
to finally ask you out,
I'll be doing

09:07.513 --> 09:09.515
a lot more of it.

09:09.515 --> 09:10.516
Are you free this evening?

09:10.516 --> 09:11.817
See, there I go already.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.085
(chuckles)

09:13.085 --> 09:14.887
How about
tomorrow night?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.556
Somebody stop me.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.457
Not me.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.499
I wonder what
time it is.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.501
Mm. Oh.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.371
It's 10:00.

09:32.371 --> 09:35.274
Oh, crap! I'm late!

09:35.274 --> 09:37.276
Is there something
I can do?

09:37.276 --> 09:39.779
Oh, yeah, make this
lousy hangover go away.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.782
Where the hell
are those aspirin?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.586
You know, perhaps I should get
you a glass of water for those.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.256
Uh, would you prefer
sparkling or still...

09:50.256 --> 09:51.023
or not.

09:51.023 --> 09:52.458
I see you're fine.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.327
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you want to finish this?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.762
No, no,
you're the guest.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.302
Yeah, it's me.
I'm running late.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.838
Move my 10:30 to 11:30.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.808
Just move
it to 11:30!

10:10.743 --> 10:12.745
I didn't realize
you smoked.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.246
Oh, yeah, I'm always
trying to quit,

10:14.246 --> 10:15.648
buy my weight
just balloons up.

10:15.648 --> 10:16.983
I mean, trust me,
you don't want to see my ass

10:16.983 --> 10:19.285
when I'm off these things.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.458
You know, I hate
to be a-a fusspot,

10:25.458 --> 10:26.959
but I'd prefer...

10:26.959 --> 10:28.394
(phone ringing)

10:29.328 --> 10:31.130
Yeah.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.399
Well, who let the dog in?

10:33.399 --> 10:34.900
Put your brother on.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.402
Put your brother on!

10:36.402 --> 10:38.738
(yelling):
Put your brother on!

10:40.339 --> 10:42.441
Oh, will you be a sweetie
and make me some coffee?

10:42.441 --> 10:44.744
Okay.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.245
Well, you know that mess
better be cleaned up

10:46.245 --> 10:47.647
by the time
I get home.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.582
Both of you.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.083
Put your brother on.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.985
Put your brother on!

10:52.985 --> 10:55.988
(yelling):
Put your brother on the phone!

10:58.424 --> 11:01.160
Oh, this is nice.

11:07.867 --> 11:08.868
I still don't understand

11:08.868 --> 11:10.436
why you have to do
all the cooking.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.438
Why don't you just take
Mel out for a nice meal?

11:12.438 --> 11:15.374
Oh, well, because
through cooking,

11:15.374 --> 11:16.876
I can truly express
my feelings for her.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.444
You know, the French
have a saying...

11:18.444 --> 11:19.345
Okay, okay.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.212
I was just making
conversation

11:20.212 --> 11:22.214
till we got home.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.216
Oh, hi, Dad.
Hey.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.551
Frasier...
Hello, Niles.

11:25.551 --> 11:26.886
I could really use
some help preparing

11:26.886 --> 11:28.688
this dish today
if you're not busy.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.990
Oh gosh, Niles, I've got
a lot of errands to run.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.491
You know,
why don't you ask Daphne?

11:32.491 --> 11:33.993
Uh, all right, all right.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.395
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
How did things go with Lorna?

11:36.395 --> 11:37.763
Oh... Did you summon up
the courage

11:37.763 --> 11:38.798
to ask her out?

11:38.798 --> 11:40.299
Well, actually...

11:40.299 --> 11:42.601
oh, come on, Frasier,
seize the moment.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.403
Faint heart never won fair lady.

11:44.403 --> 11:45.905
You know, the French
have a saying...

11:45.905 --> 11:48.407
Morning, Niles.
Hey...

11:58.284 --> 11:59.151
Walk me out.

11:59.685 --> 12:00.653
Mm.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.655
I have some
really great news.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.491
Really? Do tell.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.260
Well, I called my office,

12:08.260 --> 12:11.197
and after my 11:30,

12:11.197 --> 12:14.066
I'm free for the
rest of the day.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.901
Oh, well, what are
you planning on doing?

12:15.901 --> 12:18.738
Hmm, being with you,
silly.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.039
Excuse me.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.240
I'm coming!

12:22.641 --> 12:25.144
You know, you are
the best thing

12:25.144 --> 12:27.913
that's happened to me
in a long time.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.225
I'm in. You happy?

12:53.105 --> 12:55.107
Whisk.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.679
Spoon.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.682
Cheese cloth.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.688
(timer dings)

13:09.688 --> 13:11.690
Perfect timing. Mm.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.059
Daphne, open the oven.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.901
Ah.

13:21.901 --> 13:22.902
Ready.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.403
Shall I close,
Dr. Crane?

13:24.403 --> 13:26.405
Please.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.975
Do you think it'll be all right?

13:29.975 --> 13:31.644
It's out of our hands now,
Daphne.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.447
(chuckles):
Ow...

13:35.447 --> 13:36.949
Thank you
for your help.

13:36.949 --> 13:38.417
Oh, my pleasure.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.885
I haven't this much fun
in the kitchen

13:39.885 --> 13:42.888
since your brother caught
his tie in the pasta machine.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.391
Oh, and the real fun's
just beginning.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.392
Clean up... Ow!

13:46.392 --> 13:48.394
Oh, oh, you silly sod.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.829
Here, run it under
some cold water.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.330
I'll fetch
the aloe cream.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.400
Oh... dear.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.837
Come here.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.405
Oh, this will help.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.906
I can't believe
I just did that.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.342
Oh, I do that sort of thing
all the time.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.243
You have to be careful.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.545
Those pan handles get
awfully hot.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.346
Oh, well, not anymore.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.850
It's got a protective
coating of skin on it now.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.853
Just give it a minute to absorb.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.322
Oh, it'll be fine.

14:17.823 --> 14:20.826
It's feeling
better already.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.330
Thanks, Daphne.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.231
MARTIN:
Hey, what's up?

14:25.231 --> 14:27.666
Nothing. Why should
anything be up?

14:27.666 --> 14:29.168
Dr. Crane burned his hand,
and I was tending to it.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.070
That's all.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.771
Oh, my.

14:32.771 --> 14:36.108
Look at the time.
I've got to run.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.045
Burn, huh?

14:40.045 --> 14:42.514
Well, you might want to keep
something cold on that.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.916
Here.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.317
You can hold
my beer for me

14:45.317 --> 14:47.353
while I watch
the game.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.191
Hello, Frasier.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.726
Oh, hello, Niles.
How are you?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.629
Fine, fine...

14:56.629 --> 14:59.298
although the oddest thing
just happened.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.433
Oh, that man on the corner's
name is Pete.

15:01.433 --> 15:02.835
If you give him a dollar,
his monkey won't make

15:02.835 --> 15:05.604
those rude gestures.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.809
No, this is
about Daphne.

15:12.478 --> 15:13.746
I burned my hand
while I was cooking,

15:13.746 --> 15:16.715
and she began
putting first aid cream on it

15:16.715 --> 15:18.751
in a very tender way,

15:19.251 --> 15:21.654
and then, uh, Dad came in,
and she jumped

15:21.654 --> 15:23.522
as if she
felt guilty.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.792
Is it possible
Daphne has feelings for me?

15:26.792 --> 15:28.594
No.

15:31.497 --> 15:34.800
Ah, well, as long as you've
considered it from all angles.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.102
If she was tender, it was
because you burned your hand.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.570
If she jumped, it was
because Dad startled her.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.039
Come on, Niles,
don't you see

15:40.039 --> 15:41.040
what's really
going on here?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.942
Obviously, I
haven't a clue.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.378
I thought that man's monkey
was waving hello.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.617
Your relationship with Mel
is growing deeper.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.119
Isn't it possible
that your fear of commitment

15:54.119 --> 15:55.621
is driving your mind
to throw up

15:55.621 --> 15:57.523
these imaginary
roadblocks?

15:57.523 --> 15:59.825
You think so? Well, you do
have a history of this.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.695
Remember the day
after you proposed to Maris?

16:02.695 --> 16:05.130
You went that evening
to the opera

16:05.130 --> 16:06.098
and you were convinced
that Leontyne Price

16:06.098 --> 16:08.600
was winking at you
the whole night.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.103
I suppose there could be
commitment issues here.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.906
Cooking a meal for one's mate
is a big first step.

16:13.906 --> 16:14.707
Yes, especially for you.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.209
I mean, Maris never let
you cook for her.

16:17.209 --> 16:18.077
That's true.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.478
The closest I ever
got was restocking

16:19.478 --> 16:23.349
the pills in her
bedside Lazy Susan.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.717
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Roz.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.720
Uh, Frasier,
thank you.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.721
It's a big help.

16:28.721 --> 16:29.722
My pleasure, Niles.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.223
Bye.

16:31.223 --> 16:32.691
Oh, Roz, I see the book club

16:32.691 --> 16:34.193
has moved on
to Wuthering Heights.

16:34.193 --> 16:35.461
ROZ:
Yes. Well...

16:35.461 --> 16:37.629
Please tell me they made
a movie out of this.

16:37.629 --> 16:38.764
Twice.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.033
Amen.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.502
So, how did your
date with Lorna go?

16:43.502 --> 16:44.536
Did you get up
enough nerve

16:44.536 --> 16:45.537
to ask her
to dinner?

16:45.537 --> 16:48.007
To dinner
and breakfast.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.808
We spent the night
together.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.945
Whoa. You went to bed
with the prom queen?

16:52.945 --> 16:56.148
Yes, and I woke up with Carrie.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.855
She smokes, she screams,
she's uncouth...

17:02.855 --> 17:04.857
I'm actually meeting her here
to break it off.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.724
So soon?
Well...

17:06.724 --> 17:08.093
The way your love life's
been going,

17:08.093 --> 17:10.596
you may want to squeeze
a couple more dates out of it.

17:10.596 --> 17:15.034
You know... nuts for the winter?

17:16.935 --> 17:18.936
Please, Roz, I could never do
that sort of thing.

17:18.936 --> 17:20.439
Whenever I know that I have
no future with a woman,

17:20.439 --> 17:22.407
I end it right then and there.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.777
Especially a woman
like Lorna--

17:24.777 --> 17:27.246
recently divorced
and vulnerable.

17:27.246 --> 17:28.747
You always take
the high road.

17:28.747 --> 17:31.050
Well, you know,
I'd like to think so.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.820
If it's one thing I've learned,
my old high school wounds

17:34.820 --> 17:37.723
are not going to be healed
by sleeping with the prom queen.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.590
Tell me about it.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.593
Prom queen,
assistant principal...

17:41.593 --> 17:44.129
You can't go home again.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.733
Good luck.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.234
How you doing,
baby cakes?

17:49.234 --> 17:50.135
Oh, fine.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.505
Mm...
Mm...

17:53.505 --> 17:55.040
Thank you.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.375
Mm.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.944
Listen, uh, Lorna,

17:58.944 --> 18:00.546
about tomorrow night, um...

18:00.546 --> 18:01.346
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.348
I know we had plans,
but I completely forgot.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.250
It's the retirement
dinner for Coach Pellet.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.652
Who?

18:06.652 --> 18:08.153
Our high school
football coach.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.922
I'd love it if
you'd go with me.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.191
Well, I-I have to be honest
with you here...

18:12.191 --> 18:13.992
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.627
The old gang
will be there.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.496
The old gang, you say?

18:17.496 --> 18:18.497
Uh-huh.

18:18.497 --> 18:19.998
You mean, like, um...

18:19.998 --> 18:22.501
Chip Clayton
and Ladd Lundquist?

18:22.501 --> 18:23.469
Yeah, the whole crowd.

18:23.469 --> 18:25.437
Can you imagine the
looks on their faces

18:25.437 --> 18:28.273
when they see us
walk in together?

18:28.273 --> 18:31.443
Yes, imagine.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.146
Oh, come on,
say you'll be my date.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.014
Well, I...

18:36.014 --> 18:39.051
wouldn't want
to let down the coach.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.056
You know, a spoon
would be nice!

18:47.793 --> 18:49.294
Oh, everyone's
inside already.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.362
I think we're
a little late.

18:50.362 --> 18:51.363
Well, I guess
we'll just have to make

18:51.363 --> 18:52.831
a grand entrance.

18:52.831 --> 18:53.832
After you.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.234
Oh, no, I have to
go check my makeup.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.569
Well, uh, why tamper
with perfection?

18:57.569 --> 18:59.905
Oh, aren't you sweet?

18:59.905 --> 19:00.706
Shall we?

19:00.706 --> 19:03.208
(phone ringing)

19:03.208 --> 19:05.043
Sorry.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.880
Hello.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.348
What now?

19:09.348 --> 19:11.683
What? What?

19:11.683 --> 19:12.451
My phone's cutting out.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.319
I'm sorry.
Just two seconds, sweetie.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.998
(yelling):
No, you can't have a party!

19:25.998 --> 19:28.500
Because I said so.
Put your brother on.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.935
Put your brother on.
Put your...

19:29.935 --> 19:31.003
Just-just a second,
honey.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.006
...brother
on the phone!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.007
You know what?
Do what you want.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.509
I-I'm on a date.

19:38.477 --> 19:39.811
Sorry.

19:39.811 --> 19:40.913
You ready?

19:40.913 --> 19:42.247
Oh, you know what?

19:42.247 --> 19:43.248
This hook keeps
coming undone.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.517
Right.
Do you mind?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.818
You know, I just took
a look inside there.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.320
Everybody's here,

19:48.787 --> 19:52.324
even old Mr. Most-likely-
to-succeed Chip Clayton.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.826
Chip Clayton's
a moron.

19:54.826 --> 19:57.296
Well, you used to be
rather fond of him

19:57.296 --> 19:58.297
back in school.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.233
Well, everybody's
changed since high school...

20:01.700 --> 20:03.702
except you.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.138
Truly, you're...

20:06.138 --> 20:08.140
you're still
the same sweet,

20:08.640 --> 20:11.109
decent guy you
always were.

20:11.109 --> 20:12.411
Thank you.

20:12.411 --> 20:13.679
No, I mean it.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.681
Believe me, I've been
with enough jerks and users

20:15.681 --> 20:17.482
to know the difference.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.784
Let's go.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.719
Uh, Lorna...

20:20.719 --> 20:23.622
I can't go in there with you.

20:23.622 --> 20:24.623
Why not?

20:25.123 --> 20:27.559
Well, because I came here
for the wrong reason--

20:27.559 --> 20:29.461
so all the cool kids
would see me

20:29.461 --> 20:31.897
with the school's
most popular girl,

20:31.897 --> 20:34.733
and I let you believe
that we had...

20:34.733 --> 20:37.135
hopes for some sort
of a future

20:37.135 --> 20:38.637
when I know in my heart
that there is none,

20:38.637 --> 20:42.140
and... well, if you
walked in there with me,

20:42.140 --> 20:43.141
it would be as my trophy,

20:43.141 --> 20:44.142
and I-I just can't
do that to you.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.511
I-I'm so sorry.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.415
You...

20:50.415 --> 20:52.417
you expect me to
walk into a room

20:52.417 --> 20:54.820
full of my
ex-classmates by myself?

20:54.820 --> 20:57.222
Like some pathetic divorcée
who couldn't scare up date

20:57.222 --> 20:58.223
for some old jock sendoff?

20:58.724 --> 20:59.524
I don't think so.

20:59.524 --> 21:00.726
Lorna, I...
You know, I thought

21:00.726 --> 21:01.660
you'd be a nice
rebound fling.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.161
Get my feet wet
dating again.

21:03.161 --> 21:04.463
You don't want
that? That's fine.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.131
Wait a minute... I'll tell you
what we are going to do!

21:06.131 --> 21:06.999
You're going
to take my arm,

21:06.999 --> 21:08.467
you're going to escort
me in that room,

21:08.467 --> 21:10.469
we're going to dance,
make out like freshmen,

21:10.469 --> 21:12.004
and leave with your
hand on my ass!

21:12.004 --> 21:14.406
You got it?!

21:17.676 --> 21:19.478
