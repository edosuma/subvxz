53:42.610 --> 53:45.526
Well, if she enjoys it,
then just let her do it.

53:45.526 --> 53:47.093
She'’s sick.

53:47.093 --> 53:49.095
She should be resting

Not stressing
about a fake wedding.

53:50.575 --> 53:52.403
You really don'’t know
your Nai Nai.

53:52.403 --> 53:55.580
You know she enjoys
bossing everyone around.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.190
Makes her feel important.

53:58.365 --> 53:59.801

53:59.801 --> 54:01.586
-Mom.
-It'’s true!

54:01.586 --> 54:04.806
That'’s why she hated to stay
in America in our house.

54:04.806 --> 54:08.027
You know? Because she could
not tell anyone what to do.

54:08.027 --> 54:10.682
Whatever I do,
never good enough for her.

54:10.682 --> 54:14.163

She'’s the one that have
a problem with me!

She'’s dying.Can'’t you be
a little more sensitive?

54:26.219 --> 54:28.352

they even hire
some professional criers.
