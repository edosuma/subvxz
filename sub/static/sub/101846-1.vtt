Eddie said he didn’t care.

47:27.554 --> 47:30.223
That wasn’t why he wanted me.

47:30.306 --> 47:33.643
He said he loved me
and we would figure it out.

47:35.645 --> 47:39.399
But we couldn’t adopt
’cause of his record.

47:41.401 --> 47:43.027
Obviously.

47:47.365 --> 47:50.410
And then, one day,
he walks in with a baby.

47:54.163 --> 47:56.165
I said, "Who is that?"

47:59.168 --> 48:02.505
Eddie smiles and says,

48:02.589 --> 48:04.591
"He’s our baby."

48:13.641 --> 48:16.269
This girl was in trouble.

48:16.352 --> 48:18.479
Eddie paid for everything.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.189
Best doctors, all of it.

48:20.273 --> 48:24.611
Her father was gonna disown her,
but Eddie put it right.

48:27.739 --> 48:30.867
Eddie said everybody’s life
got saved that day.

48:41.169 --> 48:43.296
I think about his mother.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.427
I think about her all the time.

48:55.433 --> 48:57.518
Do you have anyone?

48:57.602 --> 48:59.228
(chuckles):
What?

49:02.148 --> 49:04.150
You wouldn’t tell me anyway.

49:08.237 --> 49:10.365
Once I found out
I couldn’t have a kid,

49:10.448 --> 49:13.284
I stopped wanting it.

49:13.368 --> 49:14.952
Thought maybe
it would be better.

49:17.914 --> 49:20.875
I shouldn’t bring a baby
into a life like this.

49:21.918 --> 49:23.920
Eddie’s a criminal.

49:26.005 --> 49:29.467
I told myself
that’s why I kept losing them.

49:31.052 --> 49:33.471
That’s why they wouldn’t
stay with me.

49:41.062 --> 49:43.231
But I really did want it.

49:45.733 --> 49:47.735
More than anything.

49:51.030 --> 49:53.908
I just had to keep living,
you know?

49:53.991 --> 49:56.703
So I burned it all up.

49:58.454 --> 50:02.041
I burned it up till there was
nothing left but the fire.

50:07.130 --> 50:09.757

with a baby.

50:31.404 --> 50:32.989
Do you make him laugh?

50:33.072 --> 50:35.450
What the hell
are you talking about?

50:35.533 --> 50:37.452
If you’ve heard him laugh.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.537
You know.

50:39.620 --> 50:42.039
Course I’ve heard him laugh.

50:42.123 --> 50:43.958
Well, then you know.

50:49.464 --> 50:51.090
He laughs.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.554
Especially when I...

50:58.681 --> 51:00.349
What?

51:00.433 --> 51:01.642
(sniffles)

51:01.726 --> 51:03.227
When what?

51:06.856 --> 51:08.274

51:10.651 --> 51:13.946
I do this thing
when I’m singing.

51:14.030 --> 51:16.032
I don’t know-- he likes it.

51:16.115 --> 51:18.826
It happened and it worked,
so I kept doing it.

51:18.910 --> 51:21.496

I’m talking about it,

it’s actually pretty weird.

51:29.003 --> 51:31.297

Harry.

Hi.

1:28:31.849 --> 1:28:35.811
Eddie and I had Paul
the year we got married.

1:28:35.894 --> 1:28:38.731
Soon after that, I found out
what he really did.

1:28:40.733 --> 1:28:42.526
I wanted to leave,

1:28:42.609 --> 1:28:47.031
but Eddie promised me that
his next job would be his last.

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:50.868
It wasn’t. And it never was.

1:28:52.911 --> 1:28:54.830
Cal was Eddie’s guy.

1:28:54.913 --> 1:28:58.292
But he didn’t want it,
not the way Eddie did.

1:28:58.375 --> 1:29:00.377
I think it even
scared him a little.

1:29:02.588 --> 1:29:04.590
But he was always there.

1:29:04.673 --> 1:29:07.885
Always... even.

1:29:10.095 --> 1:29:11.889
We started
confiding in each other,

1:29:11.972 --> 1:29:16.602
and eventually we fell in love.

1:29:19.980 --> 1:29:22.941

you were hiding from.

1:29:35.412 --> 1:29:38.332
That’s when Eddie found us.

1:29:38.415 --> 1:29:41.418
He loved us too much to hurt us,
but he wasn’t gonna let us go

1:29:41.502 --> 1:29:44.254
without getting
something in return.

1:29:44.338 --> 1:29:47.299
So we made a deal.

1:29:47.382 --> 1:29:50.469
We would get to be together.

1:29:50.552 --> 1:29:52.763
We could get out.

1:29:55.140 --> 1:29:58.310
But one day Eddie would call,

1:29:58.393 --> 1:30:01.647

to say no.

1:30:04.650 --> 1:30:06.276

1:30:08.278 --> 1:30:09.905

1:30:16.662 --> 1:30:20.999

gotten out.

1:30:43.188 --> 1:30:44.815
We put the past in a box,

1:30:44.898 --> 1:30:48.694

in a secret drawer.

1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:52.865

that maybe it would just...

1:30:54.908 --> 1:30:56.326
...disappear.
