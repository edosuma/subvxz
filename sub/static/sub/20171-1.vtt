01:06.169 --> 01:09.034
What we see
is sometimes never is.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.830
A mind is a wondrous thing.

01:11.864 --> 01:15.661
And if you're guessing
you'll probably say
this was California,

01:15.696 --> 01:18.008
and from the distance
it could well be.

01:18.043 --> 01:21.702
But the world I come from,
this world,

01:21.736 --> 01:23.428
is far from California.

01:23.462 --> 01:25.775
This is Southern Siberia.

01:25.809 --> 01:27.570
The former Soviet Union.

01:27.604 --> 01:31.021
Rich in oil, but also
the deserts of Asia.

01:31.056 --> 01:36.717
Your freedom in this place, is the ultimate bargaining chip for those who own it.

01:36.751 --> 01:41.515
Remaining alive,
that's a tax paid
on a daily basis.

01:41.549 --> 01:44.276
It's a tax
that keeps rising.

01:44.311 --> 01:48.142
Like a shadow, this tax,
it never leaves your sight.

01:48.177 --> 01:50.179
The iron heel
you're born under,

01:50.213 --> 01:52.664
is the heel
by which you die.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.926
Mr. Lou.

02:13.961 --> 02:17.654
As we've agreed,
I'll be forwarding
the diamonds to Boris.

02:20.692 --> 02:24.834
After that we pass
the package on to
Amoto san.

02:24.868 --> 02:26.387
I've arranged to ship it
by boat.

02:26.422 --> 02:28.493
In three day it will be
in Hong Kong.

02:29.597 --> 02:32.255
Your guys are the best
lapidaries in the world.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.950
Tony, our guys are
the best lapidaries,

02:37.985 --> 02:40.677
and your guys are
the best buyers
in America.

02:41.885 --> 02:44.578
I hope you've
got everything
organized already.

02:45.372 --> 02:47.857
Brother, you know my guys.

02:47.891 --> 02:49.617
You know you can
count on them.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.585
This is not
their first time.

02:55.727 --> 02:59.731
The only person
worth trusting was
the most dangerous.

02:59.765 --> 03:03.252
And even he was at behest
of the wolves he employed.

03:03.286 --> 03:07.601
The one thing you learn
as quick as taking
your first breath,

03:07.635 --> 03:11.156
is that nothing is ever
what it seems.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.952
The flash, the glitzs,
the stars

03:13.986 --> 03:18.474
only shine for those who chose not to see beyond them.

03:30.727 --> 03:31.797
Mussa?

03:32.660 --> 03:34.869
I've been
expecting your call.

03:34.904 --> 03:36.492
Did something
unusual happen?

03:37.976 --> 03:39.564
No. Nothing unusual.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.257
No. I'm studying the stars.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.401
You know, one of the most
brilliant of them all.

03:50.782 --> 03:51.817
This one here.

03:52.611 --> 03:54.026
My Eastern star.

04:02.345 --> 04:03.726
I don't have it.

04:06.625 --> 04:10.042
And how can you be so sure
I have this Star of East?

04:12.217 --> 04:13.563
So, what's the juice?

04:15.393 --> 04:19.017
Because of our relationship,
I'm willing to sell you
the Star of East

04:20.743 --> 04:22.123
for half price.

04:22.158 --> 04:23.780
Thirty million US.

04:23.815 --> 04:26.093
Thirty million fucking dollars
from me? What do you want
from me?

04:26.127 --> 04:27.474
You want cash?

04:27.508 --> 04:28.923
Then make the fucking deal.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.306
Good evening.

05:07.030 --> 05:08.100
You again.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.828
Have you seen this girl?

05:11.863 --> 05:13.520
Stop there.

05:13.554 --> 05:16.350
I want you to write down
what I tell you.

05:16.385 --> 05:18.110
Don't worry.
I'll remember it.

05:18.145 --> 05:19.733
Indulge me.

05:19.767 --> 05:23.875
I want you to write it down,
and keep it in your pocket,
asshole.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.635
Uh, let me explain.

05:25.670 --> 05:28.431
When she worked here
I was planning to come in
and propose,

05:28.466 --> 05:30.399
but she disappeared
unexpectedly.

05:30.433 --> 05:31.986
Has she been
around since then?

05:32.021 --> 05:33.056
No.

05:33.091 --> 05:34.023
No!

05:34.264 --> 05:35.542
No!

05:35.576 --> 05:38.407
Now, listen.
I'm gonna write
this down for you.

05:38.441 --> 05:40.098
She's never been
back here.

05:41.099 --> 05:42.480
Get it.

05:42.514 --> 05:45.068
She walked out the door,
and we haven't seen her since.

05:45.103 --> 05:46.415
Is that clear?

05:46.449 --> 05:49.832
You've been
coming into my place
for two years.

05:49.866 --> 05:51.281
You're so fixated,

05:51.316 --> 05:53.836
you ask the same question
time after time

05:53.870 --> 05:57.011
even though we keep saying,
"We haven't seen the bitch".

05:57.978 --> 05:59.082
Get out of here!

06:05.123 --> 06:06.366
Sorry.

06:06.883 --> 06:08.057
Thanks a lot.

06:11.474 --> 06:15.029
Ruslan was not the brightest star in the room.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.411
But he never gave up...

06:18.447 --> 06:19.827
On me, that is.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.555
Neither did Arman.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.489
My two sidekicks.

06:28.284 --> 06:29.837
My two lovers.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.840
My one dilemma.

06:45.957 --> 06:48.546
Baby, just come see me.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.065
Just come by.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.067
I've a nice surprise.

06:58.038 --> 07:00.074
You're nicer than usual.
What's the occasion?

07:02.387 --> 07:03.664
Are you the surprise?

07:05.183 --> 07:07.841
I'm talking to my daughter.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.533
How long have
you been answering
to the name "sweetheart"?

07:10.568 --> 07:13.502
-I wouldn't have thought--
-You listen, lady. When I want
your opinion...

07:14.503 --> 07:15.849
I'll ask for it.

07:19.059 --> 07:21.751
So Mike promised to bring
the stone today.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.513
Okay.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.894
It's my Star...

07:30.104 --> 07:31.520
of the East.

07:33.832 --> 07:35.247
Where'd you plan to meet?

07:36.904 --> 07:39.424
It will be
at the factory,
as usual.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.081
I put the boys there.

07:41.115 --> 07:42.185
There'll be no trouble.

07:43.290 --> 07:44.567
We'll be there
in three hours.

07:46.673 --> 07:47.984
You're not going.

07:49.227 --> 07:50.573
What do you mean?

07:56.959 --> 07:58.167
She is.

07:58.926 --> 08:00.031
Why?

08:01.584 --> 08:04.898
It's my... decision.

08:05.554 --> 08:07.210
Look at his face.

08:07.245 --> 08:08.798
See I was right.
He's happy.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.041
Have you lost your mind?

08:10.075 --> 08:13.147
You forget who took you
under his wing...

08:14.217 --> 08:16.254
after your father died?

08:16.288 --> 08:18.912
Who fed you...
all these years?

08:19.602 --> 08:21.155
I remember.

08:21.190 --> 08:23.641
But I seemed to be hungry
no matter how much I ate...

08:24.676 --> 08:26.057
in your place, Mussa.

08:26.091 --> 08:27.196
In my place?

08:30.613 --> 08:33.029
I remember.

08:33.063 --> 08:36.619
You had the look
of a wolf cub
two years ago...

08:38.518 --> 08:41.624
when I punished your
little girlfriend, Aliah.

08:46.249 --> 08:47.803
You owe me.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.190
Hmm. They're all
$10,000 bills.

08:59.435 --> 09:01.126
I didn't know
they made them.

09:01.161 --> 09:02.300
Yes, they're rare...

09:03.784 --> 09:05.752
not available
unless required...

09:07.616 --> 09:09.272
by those who can afford.

09:12.103 --> 09:14.036
So, my repeat is
for the last time,

09:14.070 --> 09:18.558
Mike is bringing
Mr. Lou's diamond to
the abandoned factory.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.525
You'll have
a security team,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.803
and Catastroff will
lead the way.

09:25.634 --> 09:26.842
Catastroff.

09:29.189 --> 09:30.328
Catastroff.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.607
Huh?

09:41.373 --> 09:42.651
So where are you going?

09:46.516 --> 09:47.759
With her.

09:49.761 --> 09:51.073
And who will you meet?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.942
I said, who will you meet?

09:59.046 --> 10:00.116
Mr. Lou.

10:01.255 --> 10:03.810
Why the fuck is
he talking about Mr. Lou?

10:03.844 --> 10:06.744
You're meeting Mike
at the factory.

10:06.778 --> 10:08.746
Try to focus on this.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.748
I'm giving you
30 million bucks,

10:12.335 --> 10:14.199
let's not fuck this up.

10:14.234 --> 10:15.684
I got it. I'm not a fool.

10:25.383 --> 10:27.040
-Catastroff.
-Huh?

10:29.042 --> 10:30.112
Oh. Right.

10:42.469 --> 10:44.264
Antonio, time to work.

10:46.231 --> 10:49.856
I was told you took this job
because you are looking
for your girlfriend.

10:49.890 --> 10:52.065
Good luck.
You won't find her here.

10:53.169 --> 10:55.551
How did you loose
your girl friend?

10:55.585 --> 10:57.691
Believe me.
It won't happen
second time.

10:58.312 --> 10:59.244
You sure?

11:00.729 --> 11:02.178
Good luck to you.

11:07.736 --> 11:10.014
Mr. Mike loves blondes.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.431
Just go.

11:15.295 --> 11:16.917
So,

11:16.952 --> 11:20.403
you want me to make
a deal with you?

11:20.438 --> 11:21.750
Khazar,

11:21.784 --> 11:22.992
let's forget the past.

11:24.269 --> 11:25.270
It's only business.

11:32.899 --> 11:37.110
You want me to take you
seriously as a businessman?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.910
Now, you know

11:43.944 --> 11:45.774
there's something
in it for me.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.293
What's in it for you?

11:48.328 --> 11:50.986
I get to pick up Aliah.
Then I'm gone.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.338
All this for a girl?

11:59.339 --> 12:00.927
Big mistake.

12:02.618 --> 12:04.862
Just stay focused

12:04.896 --> 12:08.313
on revenge for
your fathers death.

12:10.143 --> 12:12.870
Arman's lust to avenge the death of his father

12:12.904 --> 12:15.217
was eclipsed
by his love for me.

12:15.907 --> 12:17.771
In a hopeless world

12:17.806 --> 12:21.050
sometimes the smallest light, shines the brightest.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.952
Antonio.

12:27.850 --> 12:29.887
Open the door
for the lady.

12:44.418 --> 12:47.628
The Siberian definition of a blood diamond

12:47.663 --> 12:52.806
is where 30 souls
suicide themselves
in 30 seconds for it.

12:53.393 --> 12:55.291
A steep price to pay,

12:55.326 --> 12:58.467
but in this part of the world, it's an even trade.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.066
Last time,
Mussa sent Arman.

13:11.998 --> 13:14.138
This time I guess
we got a...

13:15.829 --> 13:19.005
very, very beautiful
young lady.

13:19.039 --> 13:20.938
-Yeah.

13:20.972 --> 13:23.595
I like your
sense of humor, Mr. Mike.

13:25.494 --> 13:29.843
I just hope you brought
the money we all agreed on...

13:29.878 --> 13:31.500
-right?
- I may be beautiful,

13:32.121 --> 13:33.571
but I'm all business.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.852
Now, then... the diamond.

13:38.887 --> 13:40.612
Hey, bitch, let's
see the money.

13:48.275 --> 13:52.901
I hope it's, uh,
30 million exactly.

13:53.694 --> 13:55.248
Right?

13:55.282 --> 13:56.490
Oh, gentlemen.

13:56.525 --> 13:59.183
After all this time
you still don't trust us?

13:59.908 --> 14:01.426
It's 30 million.

14:01.461 --> 14:03.532
And how do I know
that the stone is real?

14:04.326 --> 14:05.534
Let me see it.

14:05.568 --> 14:07.467
Is this your
first transaction?

14:07.501 --> 14:09.400
Nothing we do is fake.

14:09.434 --> 14:10.642
This is real!

14:13.887 --> 14:15.095
Look at it!

14:18.927 --> 14:21.619
You see, when you're
dealing with us,

14:23.207 --> 14:24.933
everything you see is real.

14:25.450 --> 14:26.520
Hmm.

14:29.109 --> 14:32.319
When laughing hyenas
come out to play,

14:32.354 --> 14:34.045
all bets are off.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.497
Our particular breed of hyena, eat their own kind.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.776
What you call
"a massacre",

14:40.810 --> 14:42.640
we call it
"fun day at the zoo".

14:46.609 --> 14:47.887
He wants to blow you.

14:49.509 --> 14:51.994
Hey, baldie.
Wanna give me
a blow job?

14:52.029 --> 14:53.858
Is that it?
Suck this!

14:58.311 --> 15:01.176
The best business
is always
clean business.

15:02.660 --> 15:03.937
Ready?

15:19.849 --> 15:21.403
This is serious shit.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.436
This is serious shit.

16:47.247 --> 16:48.697
In your place, Mussa.

17:09.476 --> 17:12.652
You whore, get what
you came for?

17:17.897 --> 17:20.521
Mussa's gonna love
the way you look with
a bullet in your head.

17:29.634 --> 17:32.120
Now, Mussa
will have to update
your portrait.

18:03.944 --> 18:06.119
When the devil
collects,

18:06.154 --> 18:09.847
he sends your friend
or your relative.

18:09.881 --> 18:13.713
A chilling reminder
not to be late on the rent.

18:13.747 --> 18:18.235
But not to Mussa.
Blood made no impression.

18:18.269 --> 18:22.204
In fact no one could discern
what he was thinking.

18:22.239 --> 18:25.276
And here nothing was ever
what it seemed.

18:26.312 --> 18:28.348
Nothing was what it seemed.

18:28.383 --> 18:31.662
But, uh, boss, I had no idea
what was going down.

18:35.769 --> 18:37.771
Hey, boss, there's a guy
from Khazar here.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.466
Baby.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.848
Oh, I'd figured it was Khazars
guys who'd grab the briefcase.

18:45.883 --> 18:49.162
Realized whose money it was,
and then sent this fool
to give it back.

18:49.197 --> 18:50.232
Am I right?

18:50.267 --> 18:52.476
Hey. So where's
the stone, pal?

18:52.510 --> 18:55.168
You got it in your mouth?
Is that why you can't talk?

18:57.101 --> 19:00.829
Khazar send me to find out
what's going on with
the territorial lines?

19:00.863 --> 19:02.244
You violated the divisions.

19:03.349 --> 19:06.800
It's his conditions
that don't suit me.

19:06.835 --> 19:08.940
You know,
what's mine is mine.
It's my territory.

19:10.425 --> 19:12.668
No one comes in here
and changes the rules.

19:13.428 --> 19:14.532
Okay?

19:16.293 --> 19:17.604
Fine then. Forget it.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.228
They're just
made-up borders.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.816
Well,

19:22.851 --> 19:24.197
the ways of god...

19:25.233 --> 19:26.544
are inscrutable.

19:31.135 --> 19:32.826
-I remember--
-Boss, it was luck.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.210
Somebody had to tell you
who stole the goods.

19:37.555 --> 19:38.936
Please.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.420
I was watching your back
for you.

19:42.111 --> 19:43.354
Focus on this.

19:43.389 --> 19:47.186
When the Soviet Union crashed in '91,

19:47.220 --> 19:49.015
Mussa was a General.

19:49.049 --> 19:52.018
So, when the rich
were running
from the wreckage

19:52.052 --> 19:55.539
outbidding each other
to police, the rest
of mother Russia,

19:55.573 --> 19:59.232
Mussa split with
his own private army.

20:00.129 --> 20:02.166
You better watch
your tongue, boy.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.719
Guess you're gonna need it.

20:03.754 --> 20:05.100
I'm not your damn boy.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.415
-You son of a bitch.
-What the fuck!

20:10.001 --> 20:11.382
He shot me!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.660
You're killing the music.

20:14.282 --> 20:16.249
You're killing the music.

20:16.284 --> 20:17.595
-Why did you do that?

20:17.630 --> 20:19.010
Have you ever used
a gun before?

20:19.045 --> 20:20.080
You stupid moron.

20:20.115 --> 20:20.943
-Boss...
-You stupid?

20:20.978 --> 20:22.428
He is fucking errand boy
for Khazar.

20:22.462 --> 20:24.706
-I'm sorry, it was an accident.
-You stupid, son of a bitch!

20:24.740 --> 20:26.086
Why do you give me
these problems?

20:26.121 --> 20:27.433
It's always the same shit
with you.

20:27.467 --> 20:28.882
I'll cut your nuts,
you bastard!

20:28.917 --> 20:30.746
Shut the fuck up, all right,
and go home.

20:30.781 --> 20:32.196
I'll deal with
my people myself.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.129
How the hell am
I supposed to get home!

20:34.163 --> 20:35.095
Hey.

20:35.130 --> 20:36.442
Your men shot me!

20:36.476 --> 20:38.547
Don't make me regret
he didn't kill you, okay?

20:38.582 --> 20:40.480
-He only wounded you.

20:40.515 --> 20:42.068
And why the fuck
didn't you kill him?

20:42.102 --> 20:43.656
Why you wound him like that?

20:43.690 --> 20:45.727
-I wasn't trying.
-You change your mind? You
confuse the shit out of me.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.867
-I should've killed him?
-One day you say
you wanna kill people,

20:47.901 --> 20:49.869
next day you wanna save people.
Next day you wanna...

20:49.903 --> 20:52.043
The prestige
of every magic trick

20:52.078 --> 20:54.356
is to have your audience
look one way,

20:54.391 --> 20:59.327
while the trick within
the trick happens exactly
where they're not looking.

20:59.361 --> 21:02.226
The art of distraction,
mis-direction.

21:02.261 --> 21:06.472
This clown in
the paisley shirt
was the distraction.

21:06.506 --> 21:10.130
The fear you see
in his eyes
was never real.

21:10.165 --> 21:11.787
None of it was.

21:11.822 --> 21:13.375
And Mussa never...

21:26.215 --> 21:29.495
Is there anything as interesting
out here as what you saw
in the shower?

21:43.888 --> 21:45.511
Don't do this.

21:45.545 --> 21:47.582
You better stop
kidding yourself right now.

21:49.756 --> 21:52.621
Why you push me away?
Who the hell do you think
you are?

21:54.761 --> 21:55.797
Wow.

21:56.522 --> 21:59.248
Brilliant. You learn quick.

21:59.283 --> 22:01.250
You don't think
I know where you're
going with this?

22:01.285 --> 22:03.563
All that money,
it's already in your car.

22:04.392 --> 22:06.048
You got a problem with that?

22:06.083 --> 22:08.672
We got a chance to split
and get the hell out of here.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.985
No way.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.229
Now, don't tell me "no way".

22:14.263 --> 22:15.886
You're in a world
of precision.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.197
The end game.

22:17.232 --> 22:19.821
And you pissed away
your target
for panic attack?

22:19.855 --> 22:21.443
You screw it up,

22:21.478 --> 22:23.411
you let a major mark
walk away,

22:23.445 --> 22:25.136
and the whole morning
I'm looking for you.

22:26.310 --> 22:27.967
Where the hell were you?

22:34.318 --> 22:35.630
How'd you find me?

22:36.320 --> 22:38.391
I can't explain now,

22:38.426 --> 22:40.393
I'm leaving, but
I'll come back for you.

22:51.128 --> 22:52.612
You don't remember anything?

22:57.617 --> 23:00.068
Don't worry, you will.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.898
It'll come to you.

23:05.487 --> 23:08.421
Okay, you want me
to leave you.

23:08.456 --> 23:10.837
I'll go, but understand
we can never come back.

23:17.741 --> 23:19.639
Thanks for helping me
with everything.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.090
I'll be back very soon.

23:36.656 --> 23:38.693
For helping you
with everything, huh?

23:42.973 --> 23:44.492
-Hey.

23:50.256 --> 23:51.188
Hmm.

23:54.536 --> 23:55.848
Put these on.

24:12.174 --> 24:13.521
I sent you a message.

24:17.145 --> 24:18.457
You brain dead?

24:18.491 --> 24:19.906
What the hell
happened to the girl?

24:19.941 --> 24:22.219
I don't know. She jumped
in your car and split.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.186
She left in a hurry.
Didn't even say anything.

24:35.128 --> 24:38.062
The end
justifies the means.

24:38.097 --> 24:40.030
I did what I had to do.

24:40.064 --> 24:45.173
We had a raging pack of wolves clawing and itching their way after us now.

24:45.207 --> 24:46.761
And we didn't care.

24:46.795 --> 24:48.901
All we had was
the two of us,

24:48.935 --> 24:51.179
and that's all
you need sometimes.

25:12.407 --> 25:14.720
You lost my money,

25:16.204 --> 25:18.862
the diamond,
and the girl.

25:20.415 --> 25:22.900
And now...

25:22.935 --> 25:27.456
you've lost something
that belonged to you.

25:28.975 --> 25:32.047
The most deadly trader Siberia has ever known,

25:32.082 --> 25:33.773
the mighty Khazar.

25:33.808 --> 25:36.845
He was medicated,
he was schizophrenic,

25:36.880 --> 25:39.848
and his army was loyal
to narcotics.

25:39.883 --> 25:42.644
The worst jet fuel
known to man.

25:46.717 --> 25:49.582
You said you had
everything under control.

25:49.617 --> 25:52.240
You have one day to get me
that case on this table.

25:53.897 --> 25:56.762
And the girl
lying next to it.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.524
She'll never
bow down to you.

26:00.559 --> 26:04.183
Do you think
I give a fuck
about that girl?

26:06.219 --> 26:07.773
Gather everyone.

26:09.878 --> 26:10.741
Say?

26:15.056 --> 26:16.126
You heard me,

26:17.368 --> 26:18.749
make the call.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.202
Don't you bullshit on me.

26:25.653 --> 26:27.068
You want a war?

26:41.807 --> 26:44.464
Are you sure that
Batro can be trusted.

26:44.499 --> 26:47.778
Batro is my father's
best friend.

26:47.813 --> 26:51.817
Believe me. The man
would never betray us.

26:51.851 --> 26:53.888
-And if he should ask
what's going on?

27:00.584 --> 27:01.861
If we keep quiet,

27:03.552 --> 27:04.968
he won't be nosy.

27:42.177 --> 27:44.352
I'll find you, no matter
where you run.

27:45.802 --> 27:47.217
Just like a wolf...

27:49.737 --> 27:51.221
I'll sniff you out.

27:56.778 --> 28:00.230
For a wolf a hundred miles
is nothing at all.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.923
Even a thousand.

28:05.580 --> 28:06.892
I'll catch up to you.

28:09.101 --> 28:10.205
Let's move.

28:36.231 --> 28:37.474
Brother?

28:38.268 --> 28:39.510
Aren't you coming?

28:53.386 --> 28:54.836
I'll catch up to you.

28:57.528 --> 29:00.255
Some would say
David had more of a
chance to beat Goliath

29:00.290 --> 29:02.982
than the two of us
had to live for a day.

29:03.017 --> 29:04.915
We took our chance and ran.

29:04.950 --> 29:07.366
When you are
consumed by love,

29:07.400 --> 29:08.954
you are bereft to fear.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.829
Look at you Ruslan,
all grown up.

30:32.106 --> 30:33.832
Like father, like son.

30:34.591 --> 30:35.764
How are you, uncle?

30:35.799 --> 30:37.111
I'm just fine.

30:45.188 --> 30:47.259
When are you gonna
tell me, Ruslan?

30:47.293 --> 30:50.503
It's your palace.
I've always wanted
one of those.

30:50.538 --> 30:52.264
Hey, who's that?

30:52.298 --> 30:54.991
Well, there's always
soldiers at a queens palace.

30:55.025 --> 30:56.716
So, I guess
if I'm the queen,

30:56.751 --> 30:59.512
then all the rest
are my subjects?

30:59.961 --> 31:01.204
That's right.

31:01.238 --> 31:02.550
Every one?

31:02.584 --> 31:05.070
Everyone of them.
The world bows at
the feet of the queen.

31:05.794 --> 31:07.382
Come sit next to me.

31:09.695 --> 31:10.903
Queen shouldn't be alone,

31:10.938 --> 31:12.629
they should have
their own prince.

31:12.663 --> 31:16.460
You could be my prince
and the whole world will
have to follow our orders.

31:16.495 --> 31:18.669
Being alone is no fun.

31:18.704 --> 31:20.395
How does the prince
get chosen?

31:20.430 --> 31:23.778
The way it works is,
the queen has to give
the chosen one her heart.

31:23.812 --> 31:24.917
How do you do that?

31:25.607 --> 31:27.299
Oh, hold on a minute.

31:28.265 --> 31:29.749
Here.

31:29.784 --> 31:30.923
Feels kind of heavy.

31:30.958 --> 31:32.028
Hold it tight.

31:32.062 --> 31:33.650
It's yours now.

31:33.684 --> 31:34.823
-Got it!
-Stop it!

31:35.928 --> 31:37.688
Leave him alone.
That's not yours.

31:37.723 --> 31:38.966
Arman stop!

31:40.933 --> 31:42.935
Maybe I do have
a heart of stone.

31:49.286 --> 31:51.392
And that's why
my life is like this.

31:53.739 --> 31:54.947
My Queen.

31:57.329 --> 32:00.401
Joyous is the fortunate soul
favored by her love.

32:01.540 --> 32:02.506
Hmm?

32:10.445 --> 32:11.688
Will you forgive me?

32:14.139 --> 32:15.623
I tried so hard
to find you.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.350
I searched so long.

32:22.250 --> 32:23.389
Now...

32:25.012 --> 32:26.392
there's something
I need to tell you.

32:34.297 --> 32:35.298
Sweetheart.

32:38.853 --> 32:41.200
It is me who has
to tell you a lot.

32:50.865 --> 32:52.280
Tell me everything.

32:57.941 --> 32:59.563
Two years ago...

33:01.013 --> 33:03.671
I worked in a casino
for a very rich man.

33:20.653 --> 33:23.622
Then one day
when I was working
at the card table,

33:23.656 --> 33:26.625
everything started
to go wrong from
the very first deal.

33:29.973 --> 33:31.940
One of the customers
started winning big.

33:31.975 --> 33:35.875
First he doubled up,
and by the 10th round,
he had tripled up.

33:35.910 --> 33:39.534
Usually in those kinds
of situation security
will do something.

33:39.569 --> 33:41.260
They'll move the guest
to a different table,

33:41.295 --> 33:42.848
or change the dealer.

33:42.882 --> 33:45.506
It's a standard response
to those situations.

33:46.541 --> 33:47.818
But not in this case.

33:55.102 --> 33:57.897
After an hour,
he took his winnings,

33:57.932 --> 34:02.178
quietly stood up,
and left the casino
through the main entrance.

34:03.455 --> 34:05.836
He walked away with
half a million dollars...

34:06.768 --> 34:08.286
along with my life.

34:45.635 --> 34:46.739
Catastroff.

34:50.260 --> 34:51.606
What do you think?

34:51.641 --> 34:53.712
Mm. It's excellent.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.516
Who was the man?

35:07.829 --> 35:08.830
Baha.

35:09.348 --> 35:10.177
Baha?

35:10.211 --> 35:11.592
-Yes.
-No.

35:13.076 --> 35:14.319
Baha...

35:15.872 --> 35:17.149
The Slick.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.496
As you wish boss.

35:23.224 --> 35:24.708
And what happened to you?

35:26.365 --> 35:27.573
Arman?

35:27.608 --> 35:30.266
That's why
you're slick, Baha.

35:31.508 --> 35:33.027
The Slick.

35:33.061 --> 35:35.892
And who are you,
Arman The Slack?

36:19.211 --> 36:20.626
It's nice music, isn't it?

36:24.837 --> 36:26.184
Do you know
why I play?

36:29.946 --> 36:31.292
I'm just getting old.

36:33.777 --> 36:35.745
When I was your age,
I was just like you.

36:37.919 --> 36:39.300
I made so
many mistakes,

36:40.267 --> 36:41.647
I went into debt.

36:44.443 --> 36:47.446
I gave away the very rights
to my life to others.

36:47.964 --> 36:48.896
For what?

36:49.690 --> 36:51.381
A mountain of debt.

36:56.628 --> 36:58.871
And now I thought
of revealing myself

37:03.186 --> 37:04.532
through my muse.

37:07.673 --> 37:08.847
I speak of you.

37:14.059 --> 37:16.234
Why'd you loose this money
in the casino tonight?

37:17.718 --> 37:19.789
It's my casino.
It's my table.

37:20.376 --> 37:21.722
It's my money.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.276
Why?

37:24.311 --> 37:25.864
The croupier
is not liable.

37:25.898 --> 37:29.350
Aliah, in any casino,
every casino, everyone is...

37:29.385 --> 37:31.490
He owned everyone,
including me.

37:31.525 --> 37:33.734
And all he wanted was me,
just for himself.

37:33.768 --> 37:36.323
Welcome to the world
run by warlords.

37:36.357 --> 37:38.532
To him, a man
of endless power,

37:38.566 --> 37:40.913
I was the one star
he could never buy.

37:41.638 --> 37:42.708
Aliah.

37:43.502 --> 37:45.504
How do we
resolve this? Hmm?

37:45.539 --> 37:46.885
'Cause I have
to get paid.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.543
I have to get paid.

37:51.372 --> 37:52.822
Is there something else?

37:58.345 --> 38:00.036
Will you compensate
me, Aliah,

38:01.071 --> 38:02.659
so you can get
through this?

38:05.144 --> 38:06.318
What can I do?

38:06.353 --> 38:07.906
I don't know,
give me something.

38:10.046 --> 38:11.392
Give me your youth.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.499
Your beauty.

38:18.192 --> 38:19.400
Your eyes.

38:22.230 --> 38:23.542
I want your eyes.

38:29.617 --> 38:32.758
So what do you say?
Aliah, you're mine?

38:34.035 --> 38:36.486
'Cause I'll give you this.
I'll give you all of it.

38:36.521 --> 38:38.592
I'll make you
master of it.

38:38.626 --> 38:41.111
- No. No.

38:41.146 --> 38:42.665
It's not as if
you have a choice.

38:45.806 --> 38:47.359
Aliah...

38:47.394 --> 38:50.328
You gave away
the rights to your life
to someone else.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.226
You've a debt,
and I've got
to get paid.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.814
You owe, you owe me!

39:01.718 --> 39:02.719
And by the way,

39:05.481 --> 39:07.172
you can't hide...

39:09.001 --> 39:10.451
'cause I'll find you.

39:13.454 --> 39:14.800
I'll find you here.

39:16.043 --> 39:17.147
I'll find you there.

39:18.666 --> 39:20.358
I'll give you two days.

39:24.327 --> 39:25.639
Aww.

39:31.196 --> 39:32.508
Make it three.

39:46.798 --> 39:49.387
Arman made me
a proposition.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.561
I was desperate
for anything.

39:51.596 --> 39:53.460
I could see you were
trying to call.

39:53.494 --> 39:55.565
But it was impossible for me
to answer the phone.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.613
From that moment
my life had ended.

40:14.653 --> 40:16.759
I thought to slash my wrist.

40:19.486 --> 40:22.627
But Arman took away
even that option.

40:26.078 --> 40:28.840
He told me my life was
no longer my own.

40:31.567 --> 40:33.638
From that point on
I shut down.

40:38.677 --> 40:41.197
There was no
room for love
in my new life.

40:45.891 --> 40:49.550
We're clearing Sector 3, proceeding to Sector 4.

40:49.585 --> 40:52.346
Arman brought me
to Khazar.

40:52.380 --> 40:54.659
Mussa conducted
his dirty business.

40:55.729 --> 40:58.007
But the dirtiest business
in this city

40:58.663 --> 41:00.561
was conducted by Khazar.

41:01.769 --> 41:04.703
Drugs, and murder for hire...

41:06.291 --> 41:09.087
He was the only one
who could deal with Mussa.

41:10.571 --> 41:13.747
This was the residue
of the Cold War.

41:14.541 --> 41:15.749
She's here.

41:16.266 --> 41:17.682
I was told...

41:20.685 --> 41:22.514
you'd sleep around,

41:23.377 --> 41:24.827
but you don't want to.

41:28.037 --> 41:29.487
You may need a job,

41:32.144 --> 41:34.284
but you, you...

41:35.734 --> 41:38.254
are of no use to me now.

41:48.298 --> 41:49.679
It's like fire.

41:52.095 --> 41:56.514
A lighter or match
can light either
a pipe or a cigar,

41:59.068 --> 42:01.070
both ways work.

42:02.002 --> 42:05.661
However the true nature
of the problem is...

42:06.558 --> 42:08.042
one is natural...

42:10.631 --> 42:11.977
and one is not.

42:28.373 --> 42:30.202
Matches are just better.

42:31.479 --> 42:33.965
Just like I'm
better than Mussa.

42:35.587 --> 42:37.106
Why bring her?

42:45.183 --> 42:46.356
So, what can I do?

42:49.049 --> 42:50.119
The truth is...

42:53.329 --> 42:55.849
these are really
games for men.

42:55.883 --> 42:57.989
She's a lot tougher
than she looks.

43:01.406 --> 43:03.132
A shooter who's an expert.

43:04.651 --> 43:06.584
Here's your chance.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.104
Prove it.

43:23.946 --> 43:25.844
Come now.

43:32.230 --> 43:33.231
I got it.

44:02.398 --> 44:03.813
They called him Cube.

44:05.366 --> 44:06.678
He could do anything.

44:07.852 --> 44:09.750
He began training
me for work.

44:10.717 --> 44:12.270
At least that's what
he called it.

44:21.762 --> 44:24.800
I wanted to throw myself
under a bullet...

44:24.834 --> 44:26.664
rather than being
an assassin.

44:27.595 --> 44:29.667
To take away the lives
of the innocent,

44:31.496 --> 44:33.256
but Cube kept me
to the program.

44:34.741 --> 44:36.604
I didn't ask
any more questions.

44:41.471 --> 44:42.714
Stop.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.831
I saw how you were looking
at Veera when she fell.

44:55.865 --> 44:57.936
I presume you felt
sorry for her.

44:58.454 --> 44:59.731
You shouldn't.

45:00.594 --> 45:02.216
She won't for you.

45:02.251 --> 45:03.977
I don't want to do
things I shouldn't.

45:05.219 --> 45:08.153
I left the man who loved me,
and wanted nothing in return.

45:10.086 --> 45:11.743
I'm getting ready
to kill people.

45:11.778 --> 45:14.539
for that son of a bitch.

45:14.573 --> 45:17.749
And I'm doing it
so I can give money
to another son of a bitch.

45:17.784 --> 45:20.856
The truth is those
sons of bitches live
on a different planet.

45:21.649 --> 45:23.375
It should be
one world for all.

45:24.963 --> 45:26.896
It's not your
decision to make.

45:27.241 --> 45:28.346
Who does?

45:29.381 --> 45:30.762
Me.

45:30.797 --> 45:32.626
I'm in charge.

45:32.660 --> 45:34.110
Everyone's exploited.

45:34.145 --> 45:36.492
At least with Khazar
you know where
he's coming from.

45:40.461 --> 45:42.187
So that makes it right?

45:42.222 --> 45:45.570
The only thing
you need to do
is pull the trigger.

45:45.604 --> 45:46.882
You have nothing to fear.

45:47.365 --> 45:48.573
Do it quickly,

45:48.607 --> 45:50.368
and don't loose
your concentration.

45:53.060 --> 45:56.754
And refrain from asking
too many questions.

45:56.788 --> 45:58.859
And I didn't ask
any more questions.

45:59.929 --> 46:01.517
But at first it was hard.

46:03.346 --> 46:04.900
Let's keep this concise.

46:04.934 --> 46:07.212
On my command. Got it?

46:08.835 --> 46:10.043
It's critical

46:24.816 --> 46:27.232
Thirty seconds.

46:27.267 --> 46:30.097
I never dreamed
one day I'd be recruited...

46:31.202 --> 46:32.859
as a hammer.

46:32.893 --> 46:36.483
All warlords here
are in the crosshairs.

46:37.967 --> 46:39.451
And to get out of hell...

46:40.211 --> 46:44.802
my new job
as just to crush.

47:08.239 --> 47:10.034
It seemed like
it wasn't real.

47:14.176 --> 47:16.903
I wanted
to be the best.

47:18.490 --> 47:20.113
I wanted to be Mussa...

47:20.941 --> 47:22.667
if only for a moment.

47:30.606 --> 47:32.470
That rendezvous...

47:32.504 --> 47:34.713
at the abandoned factory,

47:34.748 --> 47:38.372
that's the first time
I failed to carry out
an assignment.

47:42.756 --> 47:44.068
Say something.

47:45.207 --> 47:46.346
Talk to me.

47:56.632 --> 47:57.978
I'm sick.

47:58.565 --> 47:59.877
Ruslan...

47:59.911 --> 48:01.499
Do you want
to stand in front?

48:01.533 --> 48:04.605
No! It will exactly be
like in that movie.

48:08.368 --> 48:10.163
-Just go.
-You really mean that?

48:11.543 --> 48:12.717
As you wish,
my Queen.

48:12.751 --> 48:15.927
Right now, I'm not willing
to come down to earth.

48:17.032 --> 48:18.240
It's clear enough.

48:22.969 --> 48:24.315
There's no need
to talk about it.

48:25.178 --> 48:27.042
Please let me
explain to you.

48:28.008 --> 48:29.837
- I love you!

48:31.598 --> 48:33.565
Oh! I love you so much.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.946
Oh! Come here.

48:36.741 --> 48:38.087
I'm so happy.

48:43.990 --> 48:45.508
Would you leave me alone?

48:49.098 --> 48:51.652
Please give me
a chance.

48:54.345 --> 48:56.450
This money will
help us survive.

48:59.143 --> 49:01.283
Thanks, but I don't want
anything from you.

49:03.802 --> 49:05.356
You should take
the money and leave.

49:06.909 --> 49:09.084
No.

49:09.118 --> 49:11.396
You know this money
will help start a new life.

49:12.121 --> 49:13.674
We'll be able to leave.

49:15.055 --> 49:17.299
Oh, really? For where?

49:17.333 --> 49:19.991
Wherever we want.
We'll just leave.

49:20.026 --> 49:21.475
We'll settle some place.

49:22.545 --> 49:24.340
We'll start a family.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.894
You'll be a great father,
I'm sure of it.

49:26.929 --> 49:28.172
How many kids
would you like?

49:28.206 --> 49:30.208
Three? Four?
How 'bout six?

49:34.833 --> 49:36.042
Stop it, Aliah.

49:41.012 --> 49:42.462
Where were you
for two years?

49:44.498 --> 49:46.155
How come you never
tried to call?

49:48.330 --> 49:51.022
I'm sorry. I told you
everything I did.

49:54.370 --> 49:55.302
Really?

49:58.133 --> 49:59.513
You've confessed
to everything?

50:01.481 --> 50:02.827
And nothing!

50:02.861 --> 50:05.036
Has he been screwing you
these two years?

50:12.561 --> 50:13.631
Please.

50:15.150 --> 50:16.358
Give me a chance.

50:23.779 --> 50:25.781
I love you, sweetheart!

50:25.815 --> 50:27.403
Aliah!

50:27.852 --> 50:29.612
Whooo!

50:36.930 --> 50:38.104
-Boo.
-Huh.

50:39.898 --> 50:41.935
We need
to go far away.

50:41.969 --> 50:43.902
And for that
we'll need money,

50:43.937 --> 50:45.663
you don't have any...

50:45.697 --> 50:47.285
even for flying.

51:06.891 --> 51:09.307
Hey, Aliah, I brought you
a present. It's in here.

51:09.342 --> 51:12.655
Thanks. Come on in.
You didn't need to bring me
a present.

51:12.690 --> 51:13.829
I told you that.

51:19.110 --> 51:21.388
Hope you like them.
It cost a lot.

51:28.775 --> 51:30.121
Forgive me.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.818
You know what's weird?

51:37.853 --> 51:40.580
When I'm with you
I feel like everything
will work out.

51:41.753 --> 51:43.134
I really envy you.

51:44.584 --> 51:47.449
You've always had
an optimistic vision
about things.

51:48.277 --> 51:49.692
Even when we were kids.

51:52.488 --> 51:53.558
I wish I did.

51:55.008 --> 51:56.216
Hey.

52:39.846 --> 52:42.193
So... that's
the whole story.

52:43.953 --> 52:45.265
Okay, I've got it.

52:45.300 --> 52:46.680
You can rely on me.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.548
We'll be leaving
tomorrow.

52:53.308 --> 52:54.585
You know where
you're going?

53:09.255 --> 53:10.532
You like it?

53:12.637 --> 53:13.707
A lonely sailboat.

53:17.780 --> 53:19.334
Like a lonely person.

53:19.368 --> 53:21.543
Do you really think
you need to leave?

53:23.130 --> 53:24.718
Fly away.

53:24.753 --> 53:25.857
Drive away.

53:26.893 --> 53:27.859
Or sail away.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.591
Sailing away is possible.

53:35.626 --> 53:38.284
An old fried of mine
gave me that picture.

53:39.664 --> 53:40.527
Buksir?

53:40.976 --> 53:42.529
You remember?

53:42.564 --> 53:45.429
You were only a little boy
when we took that trip
many years ago.

53:46.430 --> 53:48.984
He's a former
customs officer.
Retired.

53:50.157 --> 53:52.712
Yes. He lives
in a little place.

53:52.746 --> 53:56.681
Where else could he live,
but by the edge of sea.

53:56.716 --> 53:58.959
After all those years
guarding the border,

53:58.994 --> 54:03.067
he feels there should
be a border for goods,
but not for people.

54:03.101 --> 54:05.103
He lives pretty much
the way he wants.

54:05.138 --> 54:08.831
I wrote his number down.
I'll tell him you'll call.

54:08.866 --> 54:10.281
He'll get us a boat?

54:11.938 --> 54:13.319
You have no
other way out.

54:13.353 --> 54:14.734
There's always
a way out.

54:26.401 --> 54:27.885
Yes, Mr. Lou.

54:28.299 --> 54:29.438
Mussa.

54:30.439 --> 54:31.647
Look out your window.

54:39.966 --> 54:40.932
You see anything?

54:50.770 --> 54:52.116
No.

54:52.150 --> 54:54.360
That means I'm still
waiting for an answer
to my question.

54:54.394 --> 54:56.396
I don't need
to repeat myself.

54:58.709 --> 54:59.641
Do I?

55:01.021 --> 55:02.506
No.

55:02.540 --> 55:04.059
You'll have your answer
in the morning.

55:22.905 --> 55:26.530
Her husband
walks in just when I'm
about to come.

55:26.564 --> 55:29.429
Bad luck. Everyone stay awake,
I got to go take a piss.

55:29.464 --> 55:31.673
Like a race horse.

55:38.404 --> 55:39.922
You can stop
right there.

55:41.234 --> 55:42.925
Put the briefcase down.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.343
Now, step back.

56:03.946 --> 56:05.948
I've brought everything
as we agreed.

56:10.194 --> 56:11.851
What's this bullshit?

56:14.440 --> 56:16.752
Hey, screw off.
Get out of here.

56:21.343 --> 56:22.689
You really brought it?

56:25.658 --> 56:28.108
I'm confused. Why the hell
did she pick you?

56:30.076 --> 56:31.664
We have an agreement.

56:31.698 --> 56:33.942
I return the money,
and then you let us both go.

56:33.976 --> 56:36.496
In a minute no one's
gonna remember...

56:37.601 --> 56:39.016
what the agreement was.

56:44.193 --> 56:45.574
No need for the guns.

56:46.989 --> 56:48.508
We got this.

56:48.543 --> 56:50.752
Grandpa's about to have
a world of hurting.

56:53.064 --> 56:54.583
We had an arrangement.

57:01.556 --> 57:03.178
I promised Mussa...

57:07.424 --> 57:09.046
I promised Khazar...

57:12.946 --> 57:14.085
Sue me.

57:14.500 --> 57:17.123
And my boys are gonna
take care of you.

57:21.023 --> 57:22.853
-Oh, shit!

57:37.350 --> 57:39.110
Come on, let's go.

57:41.492 --> 57:43.494
Hey, Sorrow.

57:43.529 --> 57:44.564
-Get in here.

57:44.599 --> 57:46.186
We're coming.
We're coming.

57:46.704 --> 57:47.947
Don't turn around.

57:49.327 --> 57:52.399
Put the weapon down.
You should've
kept your word.

57:52.434 --> 57:54.229
Take the case
and get out of here.

57:54.263 --> 57:56.473
Go on, Red, help him.

58:05.343 --> 58:08.485
He wiped out everybody.

58:09.140 --> 58:10.521
Drop the gun.

58:30.196 --> 58:31.646
Which one
do I put it in?

58:32.578 --> 58:33.682
What do you mean?

58:35.408 --> 58:37.548
I mean, which car?

58:37.583 --> 58:39.757
There's ours and the one
the bald guy came in.

58:42.588 --> 58:44.728
Do I have
to draw you a map?

58:44.762 --> 58:47.247
If you hadn't asked me,
which car would you
guessed, cousin?

58:58.120 --> 58:59.501
You know the end...

58:59.536 --> 59:02.573
it's who's still standing
that counts.
Friends are nothing.

59:02.608 --> 59:04.886
It's about money,
weapons and power.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.025
You're forgetting something.

59:06.059 --> 59:07.958
No, you're
forgetting something.

59:07.992 --> 59:10.339
Anyone can be bought
if you know the price.

59:15.413 --> 59:17.830
So, tell me...

59:17.864 --> 59:20.729
what did you have to
come up with to conquer
the heart of stone?

59:21.627 --> 59:22.904
How much?

59:23.836 --> 59:25.216
Arman,

59:25.251 --> 59:26.908
you can't buy
love with money.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.710
Hey, Sorrow.

59:35.744 --> 59:37.988
Who beat the shit
out of you?

01:00:10.745 --> 01:00:12.574
What the fuck! What the fuck!
What the fuck!

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.989
What the hell
happened here?

01:00:14.024 --> 01:00:16.647
If I leave you guys
for five seconds
everything falls apart?

01:00:16.682 --> 01:00:19.512
Son of a bitch!

01:00:19.546 --> 01:00:21.065
Son of a bitch!

01:00:22.308 --> 01:00:23.654
Who the fuck did this?

01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:25.380
Now, what am I
supposed to tell Arman?

01:00:31.766 --> 01:00:33.630
Who did this? Who?

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:36.391
Sl... Slick.

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.228
So, that's it?

01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:50.163
That's it.

01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:53.373
-You need to kill them.

01:00:57.101 --> 01:00:58.275
And the girl...

01:00:59.379 --> 01:01:01.036
before Mussa finds her.

01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:13.462
Oh, I'm getting hungry.

01:01:15.844 --> 01:01:17.259
Where's the package?

01:01:17.294 --> 01:01:18.709
It's in the trunk.

01:01:22.092 --> 01:01:23.127
Hello, boss.

01:01:23.403 --> 01:01:24.715
Baha.

01:01:31.998 --> 01:01:34.345
Come on, let's
pull over now.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.830
We're not in
a big hurry now.

01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:38.487
You're feeling better?

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.938
Yeah, I'm good.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.734
Are you hungry at all?

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:47.048
We need to get far away
from these guys.

01:01:48.946 --> 01:01:51.777
Come on, you have to admit,
that's a pretty smart idea.

01:01:55.297 --> 01:01:56.402
Yeah, I guess.

01:02:01.441 --> 01:02:03.512
I'm gonna split
you open, baby.

01:02:04.651 --> 01:02:07.068
I'm gonna split
you open wide.

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:10.278
Wide.

01:02:14.213 --> 01:02:15.732
You fuck with me?

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:18.286
Always a heart of stone.

01:02:23.187 --> 01:02:25.293
What about that place?
You wanna stop there?

01:02:36.304 --> 01:02:38.030
What is it, boss? What?

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:41.965
What's the matter?

01:02:42.517 --> 01:02:43.483
Boss?

01:02:46.832 --> 01:02:48.212
Where the fuck is it?

01:02:48.937 --> 01:02:50.628
Where the fuck is it?

01:02:50.663 --> 01:02:52.251
Where is it?

01:02:52.285 --> 01:02:55.357
-I'll cut you into pieces,
you fucking piece of shit.

01:02:55.392 --> 01:02:56.600
Where the fuck is it?

01:02:56.634 --> 01:02:58.602
-You dumb...

01:02:58.636 --> 01:03:00.742
What you fuck?
What you fuck?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.020
What you fuck?
What you fuck?

01:03:07.404 --> 01:03:08.923
You piece of shit!

01:03:08.957 --> 01:03:10.372
You piece of shit!

01:03:11.442 --> 01:03:12.719
You piece of shit!

01:03:12.754 --> 01:03:14.100
Where is it?

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:16.896
Fuck you!

01:03:28.425 --> 01:03:30.496
I want a fucking reason.

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:32.498
I want a fucking reason.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:38.987
Get away from me.

01:03:39.022 --> 01:03:41.300
Shut up!

01:03:49.377 --> 01:03:50.481
So, why'd you do that?

01:03:56.902 --> 01:03:58.731
I thought you were
going to give it back,

01:03:58.765 --> 01:04:00.353
so I got up
and switched them.

01:04:01.285 --> 01:04:02.355
You kept sleeping.

01:04:04.702 --> 01:04:06.187
I'm going to buy
some snacks.

01:04:07.222 --> 01:04:08.327
Call Buksir.

01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:10.916
Everything's going
to be all right.

01:04:17.577 --> 01:04:20.339
Well, just the right time
to talk business.

01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:23.514
-Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:25.413
Yeah? Is that a "yeah"?

01:04:25.447 --> 01:04:28.174
At least I got
a "Yeah". That's a step
in the right direction.

01:04:28.209 --> 01:04:29.831
Haven't even told you
why I have called.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.282
I'm liking this.

01:04:32.316 --> 01:04:34.284
How about a "Yeah"
to where my money is?

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.458
Well, you got one guess.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.185
Only one?

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.084
Fucking magnanimous
of you, nephew.

01:04:41.118 --> 01:04:43.120
I get one guess,
you stingy little bastard.

01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:45.019
Could it be... could it
be the little girl?

01:04:45.053 --> 01:04:47.435
The little catch of a girl
you introduced to Khazar?

01:04:48.574 --> 01:04:50.058
Stupid move, Arman.

01:04:50.093 --> 01:04:51.922
You never
gave her a choice.

01:04:51.957 --> 01:04:53.855
She would have
wound up there anyway.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.272
Not necessarily, you know.
She could have stripped down
and gotten into bed.

01:04:57.307 --> 01:04:58.929
We would've
all been closer.

01:04:58.964 --> 01:05:01.656
Your idea of close,
it's not really an option.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.865
Well, this case
is the worst but...

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.349
Fuck it. Whatever.

01:05:05.384 --> 01:05:06.903
So what's it like
on the run?

01:05:07.696 --> 01:05:08.905
What do you think?

01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:11.045
You set this in motion.

01:05:11.079 --> 01:05:12.356
You cut all of us loose.

01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:14.289
Why? You gonna be working
with Khazar now?

01:05:14.324 --> 01:05:16.257
I'm just trying
not to get pissed on.

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:18.742
What do you say
we amend the situation?

01:05:18.776 --> 01:05:20.986
Well, as always,
you know best.

01:05:22.608 --> 01:05:25.680
Well, why don't we shake
hands on it, at least, huh?
Kiss and makeup?

01:05:26.474 --> 01:05:27.751
All right.

01:05:27.785 --> 01:05:29.270
Which hands you have
there for me?

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:31.410
The left. Why?

01:05:31.444 --> 01:05:33.722
Because I want
to reach out
to your imagination.

01:05:33.757 --> 01:05:36.933
You know how I picture things in my mind before I put 'em on canvas.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:41.454
I want you to know that I have the feels, the sensibility for your sense of touch.

01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:43.836
Okay, I feel it.

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:45.355
I feel it deeply.

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:47.909
We'll be in touch.
I'll bring the money to you.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.290
By the way, Khazar
was generous enough

01:05:49.324 --> 01:05:51.119
to invite me to dinner
tonight, you know.

01:05:51.154 --> 01:05:53.466
That was nice.
In fact, he's on
speaker phone right now.

01:05:55.227 --> 01:05:58.368
He wants
to commission me
to do a portrait.

01:05:59.231 --> 01:06:02.061
I said to him,
"It's a brilliant idea."

01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:05.754
It's brilliant
because it speaks
of a resolution.

01:06:06.203 --> 01:06:07.998
But...

01:06:08.033 --> 01:06:10.207
he insists on falling
upside down.

01:06:10.242 --> 01:06:13.590
Though not from the ceiling
like this. And I told him,
I say, "Come on, Khazar."

01:06:14.936 --> 01:06:16.524
How can I possibly
paint you right.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:19.734
How? Tell me how?

01:06:21.632 --> 01:06:24.256
I mean, do you know
how the roads in America
got so smooth?

01:06:24.842 --> 01:06:26.534
No. Tell me.

01:06:26.568 --> 01:06:29.778
Because they're paved
with the very bones
of smooth guys like Khazar.

01:06:29.813 --> 01:06:30.917
Right, Khazar?

01:06:30.952 --> 01:06:32.678
-Really cool guys.
-Excuse me.

01:06:33.575 --> 01:06:34.645
Yeah.

01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:36.923
So, what do you want?

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:38.511
I want nothing.

01:06:38.546 --> 01:06:42.239
I want my money,
I want my diamonds,
I want that bitch of a cunt.

01:06:42.274 --> 01:06:44.414
Or I swear for the bones
for your ass, numb-nuts.

01:06:44.448 --> 01:06:47.072
You'd kill me,
like you killed
my father?

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:50.385
You know what, Arman,
you know a lot

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.387
but more important what
you don't understand

01:06:52.422 --> 01:06:57.358
which is that money sometimes
requires a sacrifice.

01:06:59.153 --> 01:07:01.017
By the way, you finish
Olga's portrait?

01:07:03.088 --> 01:07:04.779
-Why?
- I have a recent
shot of her.

01:07:06.884 --> 01:07:08.645
I'm gonna send
it right now.

01:07:13.753 --> 01:07:16.032
Make it easy for you
to finish your work.

01:07:19.449 --> 01:07:22.831
I had Mussa's
diamond and his cash.

01:07:22.866 --> 01:07:24.212
Let's go.

01:07:24.247 --> 01:07:28.113
He was as angry as Lucifer when denied the earth.

01:07:28.147 --> 01:07:30.770
But when he learned
that one woman,

01:07:30.805 --> 01:07:34.533
his most constant lover
had died in this war,

01:07:35.361 --> 01:07:37.639
a war of his own invention,

01:07:38.916 --> 01:07:41.298
all of our moments
were numbered.

01:07:46.131 --> 01:07:48.202
You sent Nachos about her?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.378
You may be right.

01:07:52.413 --> 01:07:54.794
Boss. Boss. What do you
want us to do with him?

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.453
Pave him into the road.

01:08:19.923 --> 01:08:21.442
May the cars...

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:25.411
pass on the road
you'd be buried in now.

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:30.692
I should be driving.

01:08:31.693 --> 01:08:32.694
I'm good.

01:08:33.661 --> 01:08:35.456
I know that.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:38.390
It's just better when
the Queen's relaxing.

01:08:38.424 --> 01:08:41.046
Not behind
the steering wheel.

01:08:41.082 --> 01:08:43.291
You are something.

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:48.572
-Watch the road.

01:08:57.167 --> 01:09:00.515
If anyone told me
a week ago I'll be paving
Khazar into the road

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:02.724
I'd told them
they were off their nut.

01:09:21.846 --> 01:09:22.951
Aliah.

01:09:23.504 --> 01:09:24.643
I see him.

01:10:04.096 --> 01:10:05.408
Look alive!

01:10:49.659 --> 01:10:50.763
Come on, Aliah.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.062
You okay?

01:11:14.097 --> 01:11:15.409
Yeah.

01:11:37.396 --> 01:11:38.466
-What did I say?
-What?

01:11:38.501 --> 01:11:40.813
What did I say?
Every single time...

01:11:42.159 --> 01:11:44.265
God dammed,
I tell you moron.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.853
What did I do?

01:11:45.887 --> 01:11:48.545
You son of a bitch.
Walking around all day
sniffing that shit...

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:51.617
you never hear
anything I say.

01:11:52.791 --> 01:11:53.619
I said get gas.

01:11:53.654 --> 01:11:55.207
Well, why the hell
was that my job?

01:11:55.241 --> 01:11:56.760
Because I told you
to do it.

01:11:56.795 --> 01:12:00.108
Next time I'm gonna
kill you and leave you
on the side of the road.

01:12:31.174 --> 01:12:32.486
I don't need a map.

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:34.591
I know this place.

01:12:34.626 --> 01:12:37.594
Tomorrow morning
there'll be a boat there,

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.459
and if you can catch it,

01:12:40.494 --> 01:12:42.737
that's all I can help.
I'll miss you.

01:12:49.572 --> 01:12:50.538
Ah.

01:12:50.573 --> 01:12:52.540

01:35:19.921 --> 01:35:21.923
until we wake up.

01:35:21.957 --> 01:35:23.510
And life remains...

01:35:24.373 --> 01:35:26.790
still the way it was.

01:35:26.824 --> 01:35:30.345
And light has
erased the dark.

01:35:32.761 --> 01:35:35.453
♪ Light of death and sorrow

01:35:37.801 --> 01:35:43.013
♪ But death is glory now

01:35:44.946 --> 01:35:47.396
♪ Death is glory now
