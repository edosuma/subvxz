WEBVTT

02:28.549 --> 02:30.818
( moaning )

02:56.777 --> 03:00.047
HEY, YOU WANT TO HEAR
MY SHORT STORY NOW?

03:00.047 --> 03:02.182
HUH?

03:07.588 --> 03:10.157
I COULD
READ IT TO YOU.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.560
YOU MEAN, AGAIN?

03:13.527 --> 03:16.497
I CHANGED THE ENDING
A LITTLE.

03:21.269 --> 03:25.172
WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S THE SAME

03:25.172 --> 03:27.207
BUT LONGER.

03:27.207 --> 03:31.479
I THINK IT'S BETTER.
MORE... RAW.

03:31.479 --> 03:35.182
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST READ THE ENDING.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.618
BUT IT WON'T
MAKE SENSE

03:37.618 --> 03:40.220
IF YOU HEAR IT
OUT OF CONTEXT.

03:42.723 --> 03:47.561
I THINK YOU SHOULD
LEAVE IT THE WAY IT WAS.
IT WAS GOOD.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.702
SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR MY NEW ENDING?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.773
YOU'LL READ IT
IN CLASS TOMORROW.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.476
SURPRISE ME.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.545
ANYWAY,
I HAVE TO GO.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.281
I PROMISED
MELINDA I'D HELP HER
WITH HER ORAL.

04:18.225 --> 04:22.296
YOU'RE TIRED OF ME,
I CAN TELL.

04:22.296 --> 04:25.333
MARCUS, I'M TIRED,
THAT'S ALL.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.703
YOU'VE LOST INTEREST.

04:29.703 --> 04:33.641
YOU HARDLY
EVEN SWEAT ANYMORE
WHEN WE HAVE SEX.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.310
I WAS NEVER MUCH
OF A SWEATER, YOU KNOW THAT.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.746
LOOK, VI,

04:38.746 --> 04:40.848
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
YOU FEEL PITY NOW.

04:40.848 --> 04:44.385
PLEASURE ISN'T
THERE ANYMORE.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.588
THE KINKINESS
IS GONE.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.727
YOU'VE BECOME KIND.

05:10.243 --> 05:13.146
"WHEN HE SAW HER,

05:13.146 --> 05:17.317
IT WAS AS IF HE COULD
WALK LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.187
HIS LEGS DIDN'T SWING,

05:20.187 --> 05:23.657
HIS ARMS
DIDN'T SPAZ AWAY.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.994
HE WASN'T
A FREAK ANYMORE,

05:26.994 --> 05:30.698
FOR SHE MADE HIM FORGET
HIS AFFLICTION.

05:30.698 --> 05:35.068
NO MORE
CEREBRAL PALSY.

05:36.570 --> 05:40.007
FROM NOW ON,
CP STOOD FOR...

05:40.007 --> 05:42.476
'CEREBRAL PERSON.'

05:45.112 --> 05:48.348
HE WAS
A CEREBRAL PERSON."

06:09.970 --> 06:12.473
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
REALLY GOOD, MARCUS.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.174
REALLY...

06:14.174 --> 06:16.910
MOVING
AND EMOTIONAL.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.814
I THOUGHT IT WAS
REALLY EMOTIONAL, TOO.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.283
Student #1:
AND, I MEAN,

06:23.283 --> 06:26.987
REALLY GOOD
WORD CHOICES.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.323
IT KIND OF REMINDED ME
A LITTLE OF FAULKNER,

06:30.323 --> 06:33.293
BUT EAST COAST
AND DISABLED.

06:34.261 --> 06:38.398
OR FLANNERY O'CONNOR.
SHE HAD MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.502
AND BORGES--
HE WAS BLIND.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.506
UPDIKE HAS PSORIASIS.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.044
MAYBE I'M WRONG,

06:51.044 --> 06:52.813
BUT...

06:52.813 --> 06:55.282
I'M AFRAID I FOUND
THE WHOLE THING

06:55.282 --> 06:57.618
TO BE A LITTLE TRITE.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.788
ITS EARNESTNESS IS...

07:00.788 --> 07:04.992
WELL... IT'S A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING.

07:04.992 --> 07:09.763
THOSE ADJECTIVES
ARE FLATFOOTED
AND REDUNDANT.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.865
I'M SORRY,
I MEAN...

07:11.865 --> 07:14.635
ANYWAY, DON'T--
WHAT DO I KNOW?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.904
DON'T EVEN LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAY.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.906
I MEAN...

07:21.208 --> 07:23.210
ANYONE ELSE?

07:28.381 --> 07:30.383
CATHERINE IS RIGHT.

07:30.383 --> 07:33.887
YOUR STORY IS
A PIECE OF SHIT.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.090
YOU EXPRESS NOTHING
BUT BANALITIES,

07:37.090 --> 07:40.393
AND, FORMALLY SPEAKING,
ARE UNABLE TO CONSTRUCT

07:40.393 --> 07:42.295
A SINGLE
COMPELLING SENTENCE.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.766
YOU RIDE ON A WAVE
OF CLICHES SO WORN, IN FACT,

07:45.766 --> 07:48.068
IT ACTUALLY APPROACHES
A LEVEL OF GROTESQUERIE.

07:48.068 --> 07:52.706
AND YOUR SUBTITLE--
"THE RAWNESS OF TRUTH"--

07:54.975 --> 07:58.111
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
A JOKE OF SOME SORT?

07:58.111 --> 08:02.550
OR ARE YOU JUST
BEING PRETENTIOUS?

08:11.124 --> 08:13.527
OKAY.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.667
WHO'S NEXT?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.277
Vi:
MARCUS, WAIT UP!

08:30.277 --> 08:32.078
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:32.078 --> 08:34.047
DON'T BE SO UPSET,
IT'S OKAY.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.283
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!
WHAT'S OKAY?

08:36.283 --> 08:39.753
- HE HATED MY STORY ALSO.
- YOU STORY WAS TERRIBLE.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.722
MARCUS, YOU'LL WRITE
SOMETHING BETTER
NEXT TIME.

08:42.722 --> 08:46.293
PATRONIZING FUCK!
IF YOU HAD BEEN HONEST
WITH ME IN THE FIRST PLACE,

08:46.293 --> 08:49.362
I WOULDN'T HAVE READ IT.
I KNEW IT WAS SHIT,

08:49.362 --> 08:51.364
BUT LIKE AN IDIOT,
I BELIEVED YOU.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.166
THAT'S NOT FAIR,
I WAS HONEST.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.903
JUST BECAUSE I WASN'T
SUCKING UP LIKE THAT
BITCH, CATHERINE--

08:55.903 --> 08:58.839
I SURE DIDN'T HEAR
YOU VOICE YOUR OPINION
WHEN IT MATTERED.

08:58.839 --> 09:02.042
I ADMIT IT,
I WAS SCARED.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.178
I WAS SHOCKED, IN FACT,
BY WHAT HE SAID.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.147
HE'S SO CONVINCING.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.884
I'M SORRY
IF I LET YOU DOWN,
BUT REALLY...

09:10.884 --> 09:12.786
I STILL SAY HE'S
JUST ONE OPINION.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.689
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
HIS BOOKS THAT MUCH.
THEY'RE ALL SO...

09:15.689 --> 09:17.758
AGGRESSIVELY
CONFRONTATIONAL.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.794
I DON'T CARE IF HE'S
WON THE PULITZER PRIZE.

09:24.998 --> 09:29.002
YOU JUST WANT TO FUCK HIM,
LIKE CATHERINE

09:29.002 --> 09:32.205
AND EVERY OTHER
WHITE CUNT ON CAMPUS.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.681
MARCUS, YOU CAN'T JUST
UNILATERALLY DECIDE
TO END THINGS.

09:40.681 --> 09:44.618
THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,
A FRIENDSHIP.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.620
YOU DON'T JUST--

09:46.620 --> 09:49.156
FUCK YOU!

09:49.156 --> 09:52.325
FUCK HIM! FUCK HIM!
FUCK HIM!

09:52.325 --> 09:54.261
( sobbing )

09:54.261 --> 09:57.030
VI, ARE YOU OKAY?

09:57.030 --> 10:00.333
YES, I'M OKAY.
I'M TOTALLY OKAY.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.080
( sobbing continues )

10:13.080 --> 10:15.816
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.551
I KNOW THAT.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.655
FUCKING CRIPPLE.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.324
WHY DO I WASTE MY TIME
WITH UNDERGRADS?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.326
THEY'RE ALL SO...

10:27.327 --> 10:29.562
JUVENILE!

10:29.562 --> 10:32.232
I JUST THOUGHT
MARCUS WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.835
I MEAN, HE'S GOT CP.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.210
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO NOW?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.980
I DON'T KNOW.
GO TO A BAR,

10:46.980 --> 10:48.949
GET LAID,
WHATEVER.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.786
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
I'LL BE JUST FINE.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.339
Bartender:
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.274
I'LL JUST HAVE
A BEER.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.782
HERE YOU GO.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.359
HI.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.834
HELLO, VI.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.405
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.943
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.147
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN...

12:27.147 --> 12:31.084
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT TO RUN
INTO YOU HERE, THAT'S ALL.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.989
WELL...

12:38.658 --> 12:40.861
NOW YOU HAVE.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.897
YEAH.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.401
THEN, ARE YOU ALONE?

12:48.401 --> 12:51.038
UM-HMM.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.875
CAN I JOIN YOU?

13:08.688 --> 13:11.291
THANKS.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.332
WELL...

13:19.332 --> 13:23.203
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT I'M REALLY HAPPY
WITH THE CLASS.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.407
I KNOW YOU MUST
HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME,

13:27.407 --> 13:29.742
BUT I'M ALSO A GREAT
ADMIRER OF YOUR WORK.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.612
"A SUNDAY LYNCHING"
ESPECIALLY...

13:32.612 --> 13:34.848
REALLY...

13:34.848 --> 13:37.317
SPOKE TO ME.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.354
GOD, I HOPE I'M NOT
EMBARRASSING YOU.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.361
YOU'RE NOT.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.965
GOOD.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.534
BECAUSE...

13:54.534 --> 13:57.204
I REALLY
AGREED WITH EVERYTHING
YOU HAD TO SAY LAST WEEK

13:57.204 --> 13:59.406
ABOUT HOW BAD
MY STORY WAS.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.408
THAT'S GOOD.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.912
I ALSO AGREED
WITH WHAT YOU SAID TODAY

14:04.912 --> 14:06.846
ABOUT MARCUS' STORY.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.149
IT IS A PIECE OF SHIT.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.789
YOU HAVE
BEAUTIFUL SKIN.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.927
THANK YOU.

14:26.333 --> 14:30.603
CATHERINE SEEMS LIKE SHE MIGHT
BECOME A REALLY GOOD WRITER.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.241
MAYBE.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.578
SHE'S OKAY.

14:42.149 --> 14:45.085
AREN'T YOU GOING OUT
WITH CATHERINE?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.688
I'M SORRY, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.490
I DIDN'T MEAN...

14:50.490 --> 14:53.426
I'M NOT GOING OUT
WITH CATHERINE.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.165
OH.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.574
DO YOU THINK I HAVE
POTENTIAL AS A WRITER?

15:11.844 --> 15:14.447
NO.

15:18.018 --> 15:21.054
THANK YOU
FOR BEING HONEST.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.702
I HAVE SO MUCH
RESPECT FOR YOU.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.353
CAN I JUST FRESHEN UP
FOR A SECOND?

16:29.022 --> 16:31.591
IT'S OVER THERE.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.493
THANKS.

17:37.157 --> 17:40.793
( whispering )
DON'T BE A RACIST.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.763
( repeating )
DON'T BE A RACIST.
DON'T BE A RACIST...

17:59.912 --> 18:02.582
IT'S REALLY
A NICE PLACE YOU HAVE.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.553
( nervous chuckle )
IS THE RENT HIGH?

18:09.422 --> 18:12.225
TAKE OFF YOUR TOP.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.744
NOW...

19:06.279 --> 19:08.548
TAKE OFF THE REST.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.876
TURN AROUND.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.390
( buckle rattles )

20:26.326 --> 20:28.561
BEND OVER.

20:50.182 --> 20:53.353
( heavy breathing )

20:56.122 --> 20:58.458
Professor:
SAY...

21:00.226 --> 21:02.295
"NIGGER, FUCK ME."

21:02.295 --> 21:06.198
Vi:
BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.336
SAY...

21:09.336 --> 21:11.504
- NI...
- NI...

21:12.605 --> 21:16.309
- ...GGER.
- ...GGER.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.812
- SAY, "NIGGER."
- NIGGER.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.081
"FUCK ME HARD."

21:22.081 --> 21:24.351
FUCK-- ME-- HARD.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.586
SAY, "NIGGER,
FUCK ME HARD."

21:26.586 --> 21:30.957
NIGGER,
FUCK ME HARD.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.759
AGAIN.

21:32.759 --> 21:35.395
NIGGER,
FUCK ME HARD.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.364
- AGAIN.
- NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.766
- AGAIN.
- NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.969
- ( grunts ) AGAIN.
- NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.438
- AGAIN!
- NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD.

21:45.438 --> 21:48.875
- AGAIN!
- NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!

22:07.093 --> 22:09.596
FREAK.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.834
( knock on door )

22:34.787 --> 22:37.356
CAN I COME IN?

22:56.275 --> 22:58.310
YOU'RE ALL...

22:58.310 --> 23:00.913
SWEATY.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.822
Vi:
"SO JOHN FLIPPED
HER AROUND,

23:09.822 --> 23:13.392
AND SLAMMED HER
AGAINST THE WALL.

23:14.326 --> 23:17.430
JANE BRACED HERSELF.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.432
SHE THOUGHT
ABOUT HER MOTHER.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.634
SHE THOUGHT
ABOUT PETER.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.370
SHE THOUGHT
ABOUT GOD...

23:24.370 --> 23:26.639
AND RAPE.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.108
SAY, 'FUCK ME,
NIGGER,

23:29.108 --> 23:31.010
FUCK ME HARD.'

23:31.010 --> 23:34.413
JOHN'S FLESH
ABRADED HER SOFT SKIN.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.083
THERE WOULD BE MARKS.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.751
SHE ACQUIESCED

23:38.751 --> 23:41.654
AND SAID WHAT
HE ASKED HER TO SAY,

23:41.654 --> 23:44.724
AND DID WHAT HE
ASKED HER TO DO.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.661
SHE HAD ENTERED COLLEGE
WITH HOPE,

23:48.661 --> 23:51.230
WITH DIGNITY,

23:52.164 --> 23:55.702
BUT SHE WOULD
GRADUATE AS A WHORE."

24:05.512 --> 24:08.214
WHY DO PEOPLE
HAVE TO BE SO UGLY,

24:08.214 --> 24:12.418
WRITE ABOUT SUCH
UGLY CHARACTERS?
IT'S PERVERTED.

24:12.418 --> 24:15.655
I KNOW YOU ALL THINK
I'M BEING PRISSY,

24:15.655 --> 24:19.125
BUT I DON'T CARE.
I WAS BROUGHT UP
IN A CERTAIN WAY,

24:19.125 --> 24:21.127
AND THIS IS...

24:21.127 --> 24:24.263
MEAN-SPIRITED.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.534
YEAH. WELL...

24:27.534 --> 24:30.136
IT DID SEEM A LITTLE...

24:30.136 --> 24:31.971
AFFECTED.

24:31.971 --> 24:36.308
LIKE BY USING
TABOO LANGUAGE,
YOU WERE TRYING

24:36.308 --> 24:39.879
TO SHOCK US
ABOUT THE HOLLOWNESS
OF YOUR CHARACTERS.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.050
I THINK IT WAS
A LITTLE BIT RACIST.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.153
IT WAS COMPLETELY RACIST.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.823
BEYOND THAT, I FELT
DEEPLY OFFENDED AS A WOMAN.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.859
AS IF WOMEN COULD
ONLY OPERATE

24:52.859 --> 24:55.194
FROM EXPERIENCES
OF OBJECTIFICATION.

24:55.194 --> 24:59.165
- TOTALLY PHALLOCENTRIC.
- SO WEIRDLY MISOGYNISTIC.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.601
WHY DOES JANE
GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

25:01.601 --> 25:04.537
IS SHE STUPID?

25:04.537 --> 25:07.306
HEY, BUT WASN'T
THIS A RAPE?

25:07.306 --> 25:10.176
OR DID I MISS SOMETHING?

25:10.176 --> 25:13.580
I'M CONFUSED,
BECAUSE IF THIS WAS A RAPE,

25:13.580 --> 25:16.783
THEN WHY WOULD SHE
BE A WHORE?

25:19.619 --> 25:22.889
IT WAS CONFESSIONAL,
YET DISHONEST.

25:22.889 --> 25:26.358
JANE PRETENDS TO BE
HORRIFIED BY THE SEXUALITY

25:26.358 --> 25:28.895
THAT SHE IN FACT
FETISHIZES.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.030
SHE SUBSUMES HERSELF
TO THE MYTH

25:31.030 --> 25:33.065
OF BLACK MALE
SEXUAL POTENCY,

25:33.065 --> 25:35.034
BUT THEN DOESN'T
FOLLOW THROUGH.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.705
SHE THINKS SHE RESPECTS
AFRO-AMERICANS,

25:38.705 --> 25:40.907
AND THINKS THEY'RE
COOL AND EXOTIC--

25:40.907 --> 25:43.576
WHAT A NOTCH
HE'D MAKE IN HER BELT--

25:43.576 --> 25:46.913
BUT OF COURSE,
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO A MANDINGO CLICHE,

25:46.913 --> 25:49.916
AND HE CALLS HER ON IT.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.685
IN CLASSIC
RACIST TRADITION,

25:52.685 --> 25:54.553
SHE DEMONIZES,
THEN RUNS FOR COVER.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.290
BUT THEN, HOW COULD
SHE BEHAVE OTHERWISE?

25:58.290 --> 26:01.493
SHE'S JUST A SPOILED
SUBURBAN WHITE GIRL

26:01.493 --> 26:04.296
WITH A BENETTON
RAINBOW COMPLEX.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.900
IT'S JUST MY OPINION,
AND WHAT DO I KNOW,

26:07.900 --> 26:11.904
BUT I THINK IT'S
A CALLOW PIECE OF WRITING.

26:14.273 --> 26:17.944
CALLOW... AND COY.

26:17.944 --> 26:22.014
JANE WANTS MORE, BUT ISN'T
HONEST ENOUGH TO ADMIT IT.

26:22.014 --> 26:25.084
IN THE END SHE RETURNS
TO THE SAFETY OF HER CRIPPLED--

26:25.084 --> 26:29.889
TRANSLATION,
SEXUALLY IMPOTENT--
BOYFRIEND.

26:29.889 --> 26:33.192
THIS IS BULLSHIT!
HER STORY WAS THE TRUTH!

26:33.192 --> 26:36.162
- RIGHT.
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

26:36.162 --> 26:38.297
- IT'S CLICHED.
- IT'S DISGUSTING.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.867
BUT IT HAPPENED!

26:46.238 --> 26:49.075
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, VI,

26:49.075 --> 26:51.443
BECAUSE ONCE
YOU START WRITING,

26:51.443 --> 26:53.412
IT ALL BECOMES
FICTION.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.347
STILL...

26:55.347 --> 26:59.585
IT CERTAINLY
IS AN IMPROVEMENT
OVER YOUR LAST STORY.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.487
THERE IS NOW
AT LEAST

27:01.487 --> 27:04.323
A BEGINNING,
A MIDDLE,

27:04.323 --> 27:07.026
AND AN END.

27:24.677 --> 27:28.748
Woman:
"TOBY, I JUST KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO BECOME A MOVIE STAR.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.283
PLEASE DON'T FORGET ME
WHEN YOU MAKE IT TO THE TOP.

27:31.283 --> 27:35.387
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.
PAM."

27:42.461 --> 27:45.664
( touch tones )

27:54.040 --> 27:57.276
- Woman: Hello?
- HELLO.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.978
IS THIS PAM?

27:58.978 --> 28:01.848
- Who is this?
- TOBY OXMAN.

28:01.848 --> 28:05.617
Toby? Oh, hi.
How are you?

28:05.617 --> 28:08.554
I'M FINE,
HOW ARE YOU?

28:08.554 --> 28:11.791
- Great.
- GREAT!

28:11.791 --> 28:16.062
- So what's going on?
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS
JUST GOING TO ASK YOU.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.697
But you called.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.333
OH, YEAH.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.002
WELL...

28:23.002 --> 28:26.172
I WAS JUST CALLING

28:26.172 --> 28:28.240
BECAUSE, WELL...

28:28.240 --> 28:30.442
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU STILL REMEMBERED ME,

28:30.442 --> 28:32.511
WHICH I GUESS YOU DO.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.947
Yeah.

28:36.382 --> 28:40.086
SO, LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE.
THE YEAR 2000!

28:40.086 --> 28:42.088
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.791
DID YOU EVER THINK
WE WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT?

28:44.791 --> 28:47.994
Well, yeah.

28:47.994 --> 28:51.030
So are you
still acting?

28:52.664 --> 28:56.402
NO. NOT ANYMORE.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.370
NO,

28:58.370 --> 29:00.739
I KIND OF CAME
TO TERMS WITH MYSELF.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.843
I REALIZED I HAD DONE
WHAT I HAD TO DO,

29:03.843 --> 29:06.012
AND IT WAS TIME
TO MOVE ON.

29:06.012 --> 29:10.149
- ( toilet flushes )
- What did you do after
you gave up on acting?

29:10.149 --> 29:14.253
I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL,
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.389
- I believe it.
- WELL, IT WAS REALLY...

29:17.389 --> 29:21.327
ALL KIND OF
A JOKE AND A RIP-OFF,
THE WHOLE THING,

29:21.327 --> 29:24.730
- SO I DROPPED OUT.
- That's too bad.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.765
WELL, BUT THEN
IT GOT ME WRITING,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.767
SO THAT WAS
A GOOD THING.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.769
Anything I might
know about?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.604
WELL...

29:32.604 --> 29:35.407
I KIND OF LET THINGS GO
ON THIS NOVEL I'D BEEN
REALLY INTO.

29:35.407 --> 29:39.145
THE WHOLE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY
IS TOTALLY CORRUPT.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.513
REALLY,
IT'S FINISHED.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.349
That's too bad.

29:43.349 --> 29:46.252
I WORKED
OVER AT A HOMELESS
SHELTER FOR A WHILE,

29:46.252 --> 29:48.587
DROVE A CAB
TO PAY THE RENT,

29:48.587 --> 29:50.823
BUT THAT WAS...

29:50.823 --> 29:52.691
I MEAN, I HAVE
SOME DIGNITY.

29:52.691 --> 29:55.828
That's good.
So then what do
you do now?

29:55.828 --> 29:57.830
I'M A DOCUMENTARY
FILMMAKER.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.631
Oh? Anything
I might have seen?

29:59.631 --> 30:02.768
NOT YET.
I'M HOPING TO
GET A GRANT

30:02.768 --> 30:05.905
FOR THIS ONE
PROJECT ON TEENAGERS.

30:05.905 --> 30:09.308
REMEMBER WHEN WE
WERE TEENAGERS?

30:09.308 --> 30:12.244
Yeah, you didn't want
to take me to the prom.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.348
I-- I DON'T
REMEMBER THAT.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.118
I do.

30:19.118 --> 30:22.821
WELL-- BUT
IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.224
WE WERE SO DIFFERENT
BACK THEN.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.529
WELL, ANYWAY...

30:30.529 --> 30:33.332
I'M LOOKING FOR SUBJECTS
FOR THIS DOCUMENTARY

30:33.332 --> 30:36.135
ON TEENAGE LIFE
IN SUBURBIA.

30:36.135 --> 30:39.405
IT'S KIND OF
AN EXPLORATION
OF THE PSYCHE,

30:39.405 --> 30:41.040
OF ITS MYTHOLOGY.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.543
I WROTE TO DERRIDA
TO SEE IF HE'D LIKE
TO DO THE NARRATION,

30:44.543 --> 30:48.280
BUT EVERYTHING'S STILL
KIND OF IN DEVELOPMENT
AT THIS POINT.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.949
Huh.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.985
I WORK IN A SHOE STORE
RIGHT NOW.

30:52.985 --> 30:56.188
BUT IT'S COOL,
I'M NOT ASHAMED.

30:56.188 --> 31:01.093
I HAVE A MUCH STRONGER
SENSE OF SELF NOW.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.695
AND ANYWAY, IT'S REALLY
VERY TEMPORARY.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.032
- That's good.
- YEAH.

31:06.032 --> 31:09.868
SO ANYWAY, TELL ME,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

31:09.868 --> 31:13.105
I'D HEARD
THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT
YOU WERE PRODUCING MOVIES.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.107
Yeah, but not
anymore.

31:15.107 --> 31:19.311
OH. TIRED OF LIFE
IN THE FAST LANE?

31:21.313 --> 31:23.182
YEAH.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.386
SO, YOU'RE...

31:27.386 --> 31:29.655
MARRIED?

31:29.655 --> 31:31.390
- Yeah.
- HUH.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.226
- KIDS?
- Yeah.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.363
- HOW MANY?
- Three.

31:37.363 --> 31:41.367
GREAT.
HOW OLD ARE THEY?

31:41.367 --> 31:43.970
EIGHT, SIX,
AND FOUR.

31:43.970 --> 31:47.473
WOW, THAT
REALLY IS GREAT.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.409
IN A FEW YEARS,
WHO KNOWS?

31:50.409 --> 31:52.644
MAYBE THEY'LL WANT
TO BE IN MY DOCUMENTARY.

31:53.779 --> 31:56.148
Listen, Toby, I can't
really talk right now.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.150
Do you mind
if I call you back?

31:58.150 --> 32:00.019
- YEAH, SURE.
- Okay. Bye.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.221
- ( phone clicks )
- OKAY, BYE.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.097
MAYBE SHE HAS
CALLER ID.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.636
Man:
DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?

32:19.471 --> 32:21.273
NO, NOT REALLY.

32:21.273 --> 32:24.010
ANY BOOKS YOU LIKE
TO READ FOR FUN?

32:24.010 --> 32:26.979
NO.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.418
( sighs )

32:32.418 --> 32:34.953
HOW 'BOUT THOSE
UNDERGROUND COMICS?

32:36.655 --> 32:38.590
I HATE READING.

32:42.094 --> 32:45.264
ALL RIGHT, SCOOBY,
LET'S NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH.

32:45.264 --> 32:48.534
WITH YOUR ATTITUDE, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO GET IN ANYWHERE.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.104
OKAY.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.173
"OKAY."

32:54.173 --> 32:57.743
SO YOU JUST
DON'T CARE?

33:01.980 --> 33:05.551
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
NOT AS YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,

33:05.551 --> 33:07.386
BUT AS A FRIEND.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.755
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE?

33:09.755 --> 33:12.091
WHAT KIND
OF LONG-TERM GOALS

33:12.091 --> 33:14.793
CAN YOU POSSIBLY HAVE?

33:14.793 --> 33:17.196
I DON'T KNOW.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.998
COME ON,
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.434
TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.272
I MEAN,

33:26.272 --> 33:29.007
I WANT TO BE ON TV.

33:30.442 --> 33:33.479
MAYBE HAVE
A TALK SHOW OR SOMETHING,

33:33.479 --> 33:36.648
LIKE CONAN
OR EARLY LETTERMAN.

33:36.648 --> 33:40.452
UH-HUH.
HOW IS IT YOU HOPE
TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL?

33:42.754 --> 33:46.358
I DON'T KNOW.
SEE IF I HAVE ANY
CONNECTIONS?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.829
( loud music playing )
* Island girl *

33:50.829 --> 33:53.699
* What you wanting
with the white man's world? *

33:53.699 --> 33:55.734
( music muffled )

34:09.380 --> 34:11.882
DID YOU KNOCK
ON HIS DOOR?

34:11.882 --> 34:14.520
YES, BUT HE JUST
SHOUTED AT ME

34:14.520 --> 34:16.788
AND USED
THE "F" WORD.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.889
SCOOBY, DINNER!

34:19.991 --> 34:24.130
WOULD ANYONE BE
INTERESTED IN BEING
HYPNOTIZED AFTER DINNER?

34:24.130 --> 34:26.264
All: NO.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.775
LET'S JUST START.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.610
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT KID.

34:39.610 --> 34:42.614
- MAYBE HE'S GAY.
- DON'T EVER SAY THAT.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.083
- WHAT IF HE IS?
- HE ISN'T.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.618
MARTY, IGNORE HIM.

34:46.618 --> 34:50.688
HE'S VEGETARIAN,
DOESN'T DO SPORTS--

34:50.688 --> 34:51.857
BRADY!

34:51.857 --> 34:54.693
AND EVEN IF HE IS...

34:54.693 --> 34:56.628
GAY PEOPLE ARE
PEOPLE TOO, YOU KNOW.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.097
YOU'RE JUST BEING
PREJUDICED.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.799
I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S GAY.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.101
I'M COOL.
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE
TO SHARE HIS ROOM.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.003
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HE DOES IN HIS ROOM

35:05.003 --> 35:07.573
THAT'S SO INTERESTING
HE DOESN'T COME DOWN
FOR DINNER.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.075
MAYBE HE'S BUILDING
A BOMB, JUST LIKE--

35:10.075 --> 35:11.877
DON'T EVEN
JOKE ABOUT THAT.

35:11.877 --> 35:15.881
I'M SERIOUS.
WHAT HAPPENS IF HE
BLOWS UP THE SCHOOL?

35:15.881 --> 35:18.417
- ( loud crash )
- THAT'S IT, I'M GOING
IN THERE.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.719
Scooby:
FUCK! WAS ANYONE
IN MY ROOM TODAY?

35:20.719 --> 35:22.521
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

35:22.521 --> 35:24.756
( footsteps approach )

35:28.093 --> 35:30.862
MY CD CASE
LIKE TOTALLY COLLAPSED.

35:32.097 --> 35:34.666
I HAVE TO RE-CATALOG
ALL WEEKEND.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.572
HEY, CAN YOU PASS
THE SALAD OVER?

35:40.572 --> 35:43.542
STEAK'S REALLY GOOD
TONIGHT.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.811
GOOD.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.079
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF HOMEWORK?
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:48.079 --> 35:51.217
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU EITHER GOT A LOT
OR YOU DON'T.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.051
- WHAT'S NOT TO KNOW?
- MARTY.

35:53.051 --> 35:56.222
YOU STARTED FILLING OUT
YOUR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS YET?

35:57.256 --> 36:00.226
I'M NOT GOING
TO COLLEGE.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.130
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

36:05.130 --> 36:07.233
I DON'T KNOW.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.438
DAD, I'M TRYING

36:12.438 --> 36:15.441
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

36:15.441 --> 36:19.345
IT'S LIKE,
REALLY HARD...

36:19.345 --> 36:22.180
AND I'M JUST LISTENING
TO SOME OLD ELTON JOHN--

36:22.180 --> 36:24.182
- GAY.
- OUT.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.984
LEAVE THE TABLE.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.521
- WHAT?
- YOU HEARD ME.
LEAVE THE TABLE!

36:29.521 --> 36:33.592
MAN, I'M OUT OF HERE.
THIS FAMILY IS SO FUCKED!

36:37.829 --> 36:40.366
MOM, IT'S NOT FAIR

36:40.366 --> 36:42.634
IF BRADY CAN SAY
THE "F" WORD AND I CAN'T.

36:42.634 --> 36:46.104
MIKEY, LISTEN UP,
'CAUSE HERE'S A LESSON.

36:46.104 --> 36:49.241
LIFE'S NOT FAIR.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.481
* Gonna have
fun, fun, fun *

36:59.651 --> 37:02.654
* 'Cause you're
the one, one, one *

37:02.654 --> 37:05.891
* We're going
to have fun... *

37:06.792 --> 37:09.461
- I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.863
- LATER.
- THANKS, ESPOSITO.

37:19.938 --> 37:23.275
( grunting )

37:25.311 --> 37:27.946
CONSUELO?

37:40.191 --> 37:42.361
CONSUELO?

37:43.495 --> 37:46.031
YES, MIKEY?

37:47.633 --> 37:50.669
DO YOU HAVE ANY
BROTHERS OR SISTERS?

37:51.503 --> 37:54.272
- YES.
- REALLY?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.942
HOW MANY?

37:58.143 --> 38:00.111
FOUR BROTHERS...

38:00.111 --> 38:02.681
AND FIVE SISTERS.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.982
WOW.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.653
WHY DID YOUR PARENTS
HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN?

38:07.653 --> 38:09.921
I MEAN,
IF THEY WERE POOR,

38:09.921 --> 38:13.058
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
TO JUST HAVE ONE OR TWO?

38:15.126 --> 38:17.396
IT WAS GOD'S WILL.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.899
BUT DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE IN GOD?

38:20.899 --> 38:22.701
HEAVEN, HELL,

38:22.701 --> 38:25.837
AND ANGELS AND ALL
THAT KIND OF STUFF?

38:28.173 --> 38:30.642
NO.

38:58.737 --> 39:02.941
SO, HOW WAS
SCHOOL TODAY?

39:03.742 --> 39:06.578
- THE SAME.
- THE SAME.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.280
THE SAME AS WHAT?

39:09.280 --> 39:11.917
JUST THE SAME.

39:19.157 --> 39:23.529
- WE'RE STUDYING THE HOLOCAUST
IN SOCIAL STUDIES.
- OH, YEAH?

39:23.529 --> 39:26.465
WE DID THE SAME THING
LAST YEAR ALSO.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.601
HOW IS THE CLASS?

39:29.601 --> 39:31.903
I'M SUPPOSED TO WATCH
"SCHINDLER'S LIST" FOR HOMEWORK.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.572
THE MOVIE'S
ALMOST FOUR HOURS.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.641
THEN I'M SUPPOSED TO WRITE
A REPORT ON SURVIVORS.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.342
YOU KNOW
ANY SURVIVORS, DAD?

39:37.342 --> 39:39.578
HMM.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.116
DO I KNOW ANY?
PERSONALLY?

39:45.116 --> 39:49.755
TECHNICALLY, YOUR ZEDA
IS A SURVIVOR.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.559
HE WAS IN
A CONCENTRATION CAMP?

39:53.559 --> 39:56.361
NO, BUT HE HAD
TO ESCAPE THE NAZIS.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.999
BUT I THOUGHT
HE CAME OVER TO AMERICA
BEFORE THE WAR.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.503
HE DID, WITH HIS FAMILY.
BUT HIS COUSINS,

40:04.503 --> 40:07.639
THEY HAD TO STAY
AND THEY WERE ALL KILLED.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.642
IF HE'D STAYED,
HE WOULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.812
SO IN MY BOOK,
HE'S A SURVIVOR.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.548
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY
HIS COUSINS THAT WERE KILLED?

40:16.548 --> 40:19.885
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED
TO HIM, OR TO ME,

40:19.885 --> 40:22.488
IF I'D BEEN ALIVE.
OR YOU.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.723
OR ME?

40:26.658 --> 40:29.427
YOU MEAN, THEN WE'RE
ALL SURVIVORS?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.597
WELL, YES.

40:31.597 --> 40:34.099
IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR HITLER,

40:34.099 --> 40:37.435
HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO LEAVE EUROPE.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.138
WE WOULD'VE BEEN
EUROPEAN.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.577
BUT THEN,
IN A SENSE,

40:45.577 --> 40:47.979
SINCE YOU WOULD'VE
NEVER MET DAD

40:47.979 --> 40:49.915
IF YOUR FAMILY HAD
STAYED IN EUROPE,

40:49.915 --> 40:53.719
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HITLER
NONE OF US WOULD'VE
BEEN BORN.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.958
GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.827
MAN--!

41:01.827 --> 41:05.764
IT'S JUST, LIKE,
CONVERSATION.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.502
TELL ME...

41:10.502 --> 41:12.638
YOU MAKE A LIVING
AT THIS?

41:14.105 --> 41:15.974
WELL, SIR,

41:15.974 --> 41:19.778
I'M ACTUALLY
NOT DOING THIS
FOR THE MONEY.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.780
WHEN YOU MAKE
A DOCUMENTARY,

41:21.780 --> 41:23.782
YOU DO IT
FOR MANY REASONS.

41:23.782 --> 41:26.785
BUT MONEY IS CERTAINLY
NOT ONE OF THEM.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.055
I DON'T GET IT.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.960
WELL, SIR...

41:36.494 --> 41:39.264
A LOT HAS HAPPENED
TO THE LANDSCAPE

41:39.264 --> 41:43.001
OF THE SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOL
SINCE I WAS A STUDENT.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.470
I FEEL IT WOULD
BE A VALUABLE,

41:45.470 --> 41:48.640
PERHAPS EVEN
ENLIGHTENING ENDEAVOR,

41:48.640 --> 41:51.476
TO CHRONICLE
THE CHANGES.

41:51.476 --> 41:54.746
TO GET INTIMATE
WITH THE REALITIES

41:54.746 --> 41:59.117
KIDS AND PARENTS FACE
IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS TODAY.

42:00.051 --> 42:02.988
YEAH, WELL,
WHATEVER.

42:02.988 --> 42:06.091
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF THERE'S INTEREST.

42:12.463 --> 42:15.000
EXCUSE ME,
WHERE'S THE BATHROOM?

42:25.644 --> 42:28.179
( sighs )

42:45.330 --> 42:47.398
YOU A PERVERT?

42:47.398 --> 42:49.668
Toby: NO.

42:55.206 --> 42:56.942
( urinal flushes )

42:56.942 --> 43:00.345
ACTUALLY, I'M
A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER.

43:00.345 --> 43:02.814
OH.

43:02.814 --> 43:05.016
YOU MEAN LIKE
"BLAIR WITCH PROJECT"?

43:07.418 --> 43:10.989
WELL, NO. UM...

43:12.457 --> 43:16.261
I'M DOING ONE ON HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENTS, IN FACT.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.296
WHAT FOR?

43:19.698 --> 43:22.233
WELL, IT'S KIND OF...

43:24.736 --> 43:27.038
IT'S KIND OF
A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY

43:27.038 --> 43:29.841
ON THE AFTERMATH
OF COLUMBINE.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.311
IS THIS, LIKE,
TO GET INTO SUNDANCE?

43:33.311 --> 43:36.782
YEAH, IT'S POSSIBLE
THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.285
DOUBT IT.

43:41.386 --> 43:45.356
ACTUALLY, THERE IS SOME INTEREST
FROM THE SUNDANCE CHANNEL.

43:47.525 --> 43:49.695
WHOOPEE.

43:51.096 --> 43:54.766
HBO AND MTV HAVE
ALSO SHOWN SOME INTEREST.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.674
SO YOU HAVE CONNECTIONS?

44:05.276 --> 44:08.513
Toby:
WE'RE TRYING TO DO A FILM

44:08.513 --> 44:10.281
ON SUBURBAN LIFESTYLES.

44:10.281 --> 44:13.318
KIND OF AN "AMERICAN FAMILY"
FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM.

44:13.318 --> 44:16.387
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT
KIDS GETTING INTO COLLEGE.

44:16.387 --> 44:19.457
- OH, IT IS.
- Marty: WHICH IS IT?

44:19.457 --> 44:22.694
- YOU GOT TO KEEP
YOUR FOCUS STRAIGHT.
- ( nervous laugh )

44:22.694 --> 44:26.131
YEAH, YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

44:27.165 --> 44:30.435
THE FOCUS IS ON
THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS
PROCESS TODAY.

44:30.435 --> 44:33.071
AND YOU WANT SCOOBY
TO BE THE FOCUS
OF ALL THIS?

44:33.071 --> 44:35.206
SCOOBY AND A FEW
OTHER STUDENTS
OF DIFFERENT

44:35.206 --> 44:37.275
SOCIOECONOMIC
BACKGROUNDS.

44:37.275 --> 44:39.544
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
ANY OTHER STUDENTS BEFORE.

44:39.544 --> 44:43.081
- I DON'T HAVE ANY YET, BUT--
- EITHER SCOOBY IS THE FOCUS
OR FORGET IT.

44:43.081 --> 44:46.217
YEAH, I THOUGHT
I WAS THE FOCUS.

44:47.753 --> 44:49.955
I WANT TO BE
THE FOCUS.

44:49.955 --> 44:51.957
- AH--!
- TOBY,

44:51.957 --> 44:54.926
WE NEED THIS TO BE
A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.

44:57.228 --> 44:59.430
I SUPPOSE
I COULD RECONCEIVE.

44:59.430 --> 45:00.966
RECONCEIVE.

45:00.966 --> 45:03.168
SCOOBY DOES HAVE
A QUALITY...

45:03.168 --> 45:05.570
THAT I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR.

45:05.570 --> 45:08.106
A QUALITY THAT IS
EMBLEMATIC OF AMERICA TODAY.

45:08.106 --> 45:11.642
IT'S PART DISILLUSIONMENT,
PART HOPE.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.678
TWINKIES!

45:13.678 --> 45:15.814
Fern:
BOYS, TAKE NAPKINS.

45:15.814 --> 45:18.016
NAPKINS.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.353
NOT TO BE CRASS,

45:22.353 --> 45:25.290
BUT WHAT DO WE GET
OUT OF THIS?

45:25.290 --> 45:28.026
DON'T WORRY,
HE DOESN'T MEAN MONEY.

45:28.026 --> 45:30.195
I KNOW.
( laughs )

45:30.195 --> 45:32.630
I KNOW THAT.

45:32.630 --> 45:34.665
WELL...

45:34.665 --> 45:36.401
SHARING YOUR STORY,

45:36.401 --> 45:38.970
YOUR UPS AND DOWNS
AND SO FORTH,

45:38.970 --> 45:42.207
CAN, I HOPE, BE
AN ILLUMINATING EXPERIENCE.

45:42.207 --> 45:44.175
YEAH.

45:44.175 --> 45:47.212
HOW DO WE KNOW
WE WON'T BE EXPLOITED?

45:48.313 --> 45:51.216
NO, IT'S TRUE.

45:51.216 --> 45:53.218
MR. LIVINGSTON,
I FULLY UNDERSTAND

45:53.218 --> 45:55.887
AND I SHARE
YOUR CONCERNS.

45:56.687 --> 45:59.490
YOU FEEL
VULNERABLE.

45:59.490 --> 46:02.027
I KNOW THIS IS
A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION

46:02.027 --> 46:05.563
BUT WHAT IT
COMES DOWN TO...

46:05.563 --> 46:08.333
IS CAN YOU MAKE
THE LEAP OF FAITH IN ME,

46:09.334 --> 46:11.536
THE SAME WAY
THAT I HAVE TO MAKE

46:11.536 --> 46:13.939
THE LEAP OF FAITH
IN YOU?

46:15.673 --> 46:18.009
This is a great school,

46:18.009 --> 46:20.011
I don't care
what anybody says.

46:20.011 --> 46:22.013
It's not perfect,

46:22.013 --> 46:24.149
but the people
are really cool--

46:24.149 --> 46:26.151
like the teachers
and kids--

46:26.151 --> 46:28.153
they really care
and all.

46:28.153 --> 46:30.388
I know they make fun
of New Jersey all the time,

46:30.388 --> 46:33.458
but I don't care,
'cause they're just snobs.

46:33.458 --> 46:35.693
'Cause Jersey is
where America's at!

46:35.693 --> 46:38.063
( cheering, grunting )

46:41.232 --> 46:43.902
Toby:
Walking down
these hallways--

46:43.902 --> 46:46.304
hallways just like
the ones

46:46.304 --> 46:48.573
I once walked down
as a teenager,

46:48.573 --> 46:52.043
I couldn't help
thinking back to a time

46:52.043 --> 46:55.480
when every day
I woke up depressed,

46:55.480 --> 46:57.315
suicidal,

46:57.315 --> 46:59.951
consumed
by despair.

46:59.951 --> 47:01.920
Had things changed?

47:01.920 --> 47:03.721
Was the competition

47:03.721 --> 47:06.257
to get into the most
prestigious schools

47:06.257 --> 47:09.394
still a requisite
rite of passage?

47:10.361 --> 47:13.464
Beneath these masks
of courtesy and friendliness,

47:13.464 --> 47:17.368
I knew that there were
darker forces at work.

47:18.203 --> 47:20.605
And I knew
that Scooby

47:20.605 --> 47:24.409
was the key
to revealing the truth.

47:25.643 --> 47:28.646
Scooby, Scooby, Scooby.

47:28.646 --> 47:31.716
What are you thinking?

47:31.716 --> 47:34.852
College, SATs,

47:34.852 --> 47:37.522
your parents,
your brothers,

47:37.522 --> 47:39.657
your friends.

47:39.657 --> 47:43.461
How is it you deal
with all this stress?

47:43.461 --> 47:46.965
The pressure to get into
the college of your choice

47:46.965 --> 47:49.067
is incredible.

47:49.968 --> 47:52.203
They did a study recently

47:52.203 --> 47:55.173
of the youth in Bosnia
during the bombing.

47:55.173 --> 47:57.042
They found
that the stress

47:57.042 --> 47:58.977
the young people
experience there

47:58.977 --> 48:02.647
was less than what
American high school
students go through

48:02.647 --> 48:04.749
when applying to college.

48:04.749 --> 48:07.252
Toby:
Is that right?

48:07.252 --> 48:09.454
- Yeah.
- My God.

48:17.128 --> 48:19.664
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

48:21.699 --> 48:23.401
WELL...

48:23.401 --> 48:26.171
I'M NOT REALLY
SURE WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY.

48:26.171 --> 48:28.406
IT'S FUNNY,
I SUPPOSE.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.708
BUT IT SEEMS
GLIB AND FACILE

48:30.708 --> 48:32.978
TO MAKE FUN
OF HOW IDIOTIC
THESE PEOPLE ARE.

48:32.978 --> 48:35.046
I'M NOT MAKING FUN.

48:35.046 --> 48:38.283
I'M SHOWING IT
AS IT REALLY IS.

48:38.283 --> 48:41.152
YOU'RE SHOWING
HOW SUPERIOR YOU ARE
TO YOUR SUBJECT.

48:41.152 --> 48:44.422
BUT I LIKE MY SUBJECT.
I LIKE THESE PEOPLE.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.757
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- YES, I DO!

48:46.757 --> 48:48.960
I LOVE THEM.

48:55.166 --> 48:58.869
- THE CAMERAWORK'S NICE.
- THANKS.

48:58.869 --> 49:01.006
I'LL TELL MIKE.

49:03.874 --> 49:06.177
WELL...

49:06.177 --> 49:08.913
IT'S STILL
JUST A BEGINNING.

49:08.913 --> 49:11.516
I KNOW I CAN...

49:11.516 --> 49:13.651
DIG DEEPER.

49:19.190 --> 49:21.059
Fern:
BUT, MARJ--

49:21.059 --> 49:22.727
MAY I CALL YOU MARJ?

49:22.727 --> 49:25.096
WHAT IT REALLY
BOILS DOWN TO IS,

49:25.096 --> 49:27.865
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
TO BE A JEW? EXACTLY.

49:27.865 --> 49:32.003
TZEDAKAH-- CHARITY.
AND THE NEW WING AT
BETH ISRAEL IS--

49:33.471 --> 49:36.441
ACTUALLY, LAST YEAR
YOU GAVE $500.

49:36.441 --> 49:39.110
BUT THIS YEAR, $1000 WOULD
NOT ONLY BE A MITZVAH,

49:39.110 --> 49:41.179
IT WOULD BRING YOU
TO A NEW LEVEL--

49:41.179 --> 49:44.182
YES, OF COURSE.
YOUR GIFT WOULD ALSO

49:44.182 --> 49:45.850
GIVE YOU A CHAGALL MENORAH

49:45.850 --> 49:48.653
AND TWO TICKETS TO THE DINNER
DANCE THIS SPRING.

49:49.687 --> 49:53.391
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.
ISRAEL NEEDS US NOW.

49:53.391 --> 49:56.227
- ( panting )
- Fern: IF NOT NOW, WHEN?

49:58.996 --> 50:02.067
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
I'LL SPEAK TO YOU
NEXT WEEK.

50:02.067 --> 50:04.702
YOU TOO. TAKE CARE.

50:04.702 --> 50:07.672
( door slams )

50:07.672 --> 50:09.674
HI, SCOOBY.

50:09.674 --> 50:12.009
SCOOBY... SCOOBY?

50:12.009 --> 50:14.011
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

50:14.011 --> 50:15.346
FINE.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.448
READY FOR TOMORROW?

50:17.448 --> 50:21.386
- WHAT'S TOMORROW?
- THE SATs, KNUCKLEHEAD.

50:21.386 --> 50:23.721
I'M NOT TAKING THEM.

50:40.071 --> 50:42.273
Just-- back--

50:50.781 --> 50:53.818
- Mikey: Mom?
- Yes, Mikey?

50:53.818 --> 50:56.954
I was looking through
one of Scooby's SAT
practice books

50:56.954 --> 51:00.091
this afternoon and I took
one of the practice tests.

51:00.091 --> 51:01.992
Guess what score I got.

51:01.992 --> 51:03.728
What?

51:03.728 --> 51:06.197
550 verbal, 520 math,

51:06.197 --> 51:09.234
and I'm only
in fifth grade.

51:13.638 --> 51:16.574
- ( knocking )
- Marty: SCOOBY?

51:16.574 --> 51:18.576
YEAH?

51:21.646 --> 51:23.514
WE HAVE TO TALK.

51:23.514 --> 51:25.416
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

51:25.416 --> 51:28.353
DON'T SCREW AROUND WITH ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

51:28.353 --> 51:30.455
YOU'RE TAKING
THOSE SATs.

51:30.455 --> 51:33.458
YOU'RE TAKING THOSE SATs
OR YOUR CD COLLECTION'S HISTORY.

51:33.458 --> 51:36.261
YOU'RE TAKING THOSE SATs
AND YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE.

51:36.261 --> 51:39.697
YOU'RE TAKING THOSE SATs
IF I HAVE TO STRAP YOUR ASS
TO A CHAIR,

51:39.697 --> 51:42.099
BUT, BUDDY,
YOU'RE TAKING THEM!

51:43.168 --> 51:45.102
OKAY.

51:46.471 --> 51:48.906
I'M TIRED OF THIS SHIT.

51:48.906 --> 51:50.808
( door slams )

52:24.475 --> 52:28.346
Toby:
WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT SCOOBY
TOOK THE SATs AFTER ALL?

52:28.346 --> 52:31.749
Brady:
NOT REALLY.
HE'S KIND OF A WUSS.

52:31.749 --> 52:35.253
OKAY.
HOW ABOUT YOU, CHERYL?

52:35.253 --> 52:37.188
WERE YOU SURPRISED?

52:37.188 --> 52:39.824
I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.892
( Toby laughs )

52:41.892 --> 52:45.230
- Brady: HOW COME YOU DRIVE
SUCH A SHITTY CAR?
- Cheryl: YEAH.

52:45.230 --> 52:47.732
( Toby laughs )
I DON'T KNOW.

52:47.732 --> 52:50.067
THAT'S INTERESTING.
A COOL CAR.

52:50.067 --> 52:52.670
IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT
TO YOU...

52:52.670 --> 52:55.206
- BRADY? A COOL CAR?
- YEAH. DUH.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.277
Scooby:
THAT'S PRETTY COOL, STANLEY.

52:59.277 --> 53:01.145
THANKS.

53:01.145 --> 53:03.681
HOW DID YOU GET IT?

53:03.681 --> 53:05.550
IT'S MY DAD'S.

53:05.550 --> 53:08.419
HE HIDES IT UNDER
SOME OLD TV GUIDES
IN HIS CLOSET.

53:11.789 --> 53:13.691
I KNOW.

53:13.691 --> 53:16.026
IS IT LOADED?

53:16.026 --> 53:18.563
NO... I DON'T THINK SO.

53:20.431 --> 53:22.800
SCOOBY, DON'T!
BE CAREFUL.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.936
I'M NOT
AN IDIOT, MAN.
I WATCH TV.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.608
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST--

53:30.608 --> 53:33.010
A LITTLE NERVOUS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

53:33.010 --> 53:35.846
YOU SHOULD BE.

53:40.685 --> 53:43.721
HERE.
YOU CAN KEEP IT.

54:09.179 --> 54:11.181
SCOOBY?

54:11.181 --> 54:12.717
YEAH?

54:14.084 --> 54:16.287
YOU KNOW...

54:17.755 --> 54:20.491
- I LIKE YOU.
- YEAH.

54:20.491 --> 54:22.827
- I KNOW.
- I MEAN...

54:22.827 --> 54:25.162
I KNOW.

54:25.162 --> 54:28.566
EVERYONE KNOWS.

54:29.367 --> 54:31.436
OH.

54:33.838 --> 54:35.506
UM...

54:35.506 --> 54:37.508
DO YOU THINK...

54:37.508 --> 54:40.945
DO YOU THINK THAT...
YOU'D LET ME...

54:44.782 --> 54:46.617
OKAY.

54:47.418 --> 54:49.554
IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

54:49.554 --> 54:52.289
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

54:57.895 --> 55:00.731
- YOU WANT SOME?
- NO, THANKS.

55:17.682 --> 55:20.951
Recording:
* I was surprised *

55:20.951 --> 55:24.589
* I was happy
for a day *

55:24.589 --> 55:27.392
* In 1975 *

55:27.392 --> 55:32.329
* I was puzzled
by a dream *

55:32.329 --> 55:35.966
- * It stayed
with me all day... *
- ( zipper slides )

55:35.966 --> 55:41.005
* In 1995 *

55:41.005 --> 55:43.841
* My brother
had confessed *

55:43.841 --> 55:49.113
* He was gay, it took
the heat off me for a while *

55:49.113 --> 55:53.183
* He stood up
with a sailor friend *

55:53.183 --> 55:57.121
* Made it known
upon my sister's *

55:57.121 --> 55:59.289
* Wedding day. *

55:59.289 --> 56:00.991
( screaming )

56:00.991 --> 56:03.494
I'M SORRY!
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
MADE YOU TAKE THE SATs.

56:03.494 --> 56:05.630
( screaming )

56:05.630 --> 56:07.598
OH GOD!
I'M BURNING
TO DEATH!

56:07.598 --> 56:10.601
- I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN!
- Conan: HEY, SCOOBY.

56:10.601 --> 56:13.237
HOW'S IT GOING?

56:13.237 --> 56:15.606
CONAN O'BRIEN?

56:15.606 --> 56:17.675
WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

56:17.675 --> 56:20.344
I'M LOOKING
FOR A LAST-MINUTE
GUEST FOR MY SHOW.

56:20.344 --> 56:22.012
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

56:22.012 --> 56:24.148
- I'LL BE YOUR GUEST.
- REALLY?

56:24.148 --> 56:27.217
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE TELEVISION,

56:27.217 --> 56:29.353
AND SEE HOW WE LOOK.

56:29.353 --> 56:32.623
COOL.

56:32.623 --> 56:35.225
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Nice to have you here.

56:35.225 --> 56:38.028
- Great to be here.
- Thank you for dressing up.

56:38.028 --> 56:40.130
This is very classy.

56:40.130 --> 56:42.900
TELL US, WHAT KIND
OF PROFESSIONAL PLANS
DO YOU HAVE?

56:42.900 --> 56:45.102
WHAT'S IN
YOUR FUTURE?

56:45.102 --> 56:46.504
WELL...

56:46.504 --> 56:48.506
I WAS THINKING

56:48.506 --> 56:50.641
I MIGHT WORK FOR YOU.

56:50.641 --> 56:52.643
TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO FOR ME?

56:52.643 --> 56:55.713
- WHAT'S YOUR IDEA?
- BE YOUR SIDEKICK.

56:55.713 --> 57:00.317
- ( audience chuckles )
- AND MAYBE, EVENTUALLY,

57:00.317 --> 57:02.219
BECOME A TV
TALK SHOW HOST.

57:02.219 --> 57:04.021
TV TALK SHOW HOST?
OKAY.

57:04.021 --> 57:06.223
YOU WERE AT SIDEKICK
EIGHT SECONDS AGO,

57:06.223 --> 57:08.025
THEN TV
TALK SHOW HOST.

57:08.025 --> 57:10.227
YOU'LL BE
A LATIN DICTATOR
IN ABOUT A MINUTE.

57:10.227 --> 57:12.530
LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY THINK
OF THE FIRST IDEA.

57:12.530 --> 57:14.231
I'M CURIOUS WHAT
THE AUDIENCE THINKS.

57:14.231 --> 57:17.101
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
SHOULD SCOOBY BE
MY NEW SIDEKICK?

57:17.101 --> 57:19.136
( audience cheers )

57:19.136 --> 57:20.471
WOW.

57:20.471 --> 57:23.073
SCOOBY,
NEW SIDEKICK,
EVERYBODY.

57:23.073 --> 57:25.175
OH, MAN.

57:26.477 --> 57:28.479
( knocking )

57:28.479 --> 57:30.681
YEAH?

57:36.453 --> 57:38.255
- HEY.
- HEY.

57:38.255 --> 57:40.491
WHAT'S UP?

57:43.227 --> 57:46.130
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TALK ABOUT
WITH YOU.

57:46.130 --> 57:48.766
WHAT?

57:52.937 --> 57:56.073
THERE'S
SOME RUMORS...

57:56.073 --> 57:58.175
LIKE WHAT?

58:01.646 --> 58:03.581
YOU KNOW...

58:03.581 --> 58:06.216
STANLEY.

58:08.185 --> 58:10.521
WHAT?

58:12.723 --> 58:15.626
LIKE, DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY.

58:17.361 --> 58:19.964
I MEAN, I'M COOL.

58:21.231 --> 58:24.268
BUT... YOU KNOW...

58:25.402 --> 58:28.138
HOW I'VE GOT
A GOOD REPUTATION
AT SCHOOL.

58:30.340 --> 58:31.375
WELL...

58:31.375 --> 58:34.011
I REALLY DON'T
WANT IT RUINED.

58:35.546 --> 58:37.514
NO PROBLEM.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.784
I'M COOL.

58:42.252 --> 58:44.154
THANKS, SCOOB.

58:49.426 --> 58:51.629
( pads clatter )

58:57.167 --> 58:58.969
- ( grunting )
- ( whistle blows )

58:58.969 --> 59:01.438
ESPOSITO, WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

59:01.438 --> 59:04.274
YOU'RE TACKLING LIKE A BITCH
ON MY FOOTBALL TEAM, SON.

59:04.274 --> 59:07.277
YOU GOTTA BEND YOUR ASS
OVER AND HIT SOMEBODY,
UNDERSTAND ME?

59:07.277 --> 59:09.479
- YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
- UNDERSTAND ME?

59:09.479 --> 59:11.281
THEN DO IT!
LIVINGSTON!

59:11.281 --> 59:13.784
THAT'S THE WAY
TO HIT THAT HOLE, SON.

59:13.784 --> 59:17.622
WE'RE GOING TO BECOME
A FOOTBALL TEAM TODAY.
LET'S MOVE THE BALL!

59:17.622 --> 59:19.556
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

59:19.556 --> 59:21.859
- BREAK!
- I WANT TO SEE YOU
HIT THOSE HOLES.

59:21.859 --> 59:23.861
DEFENSE, FILL
THOSE GODDAMN GAPS.

59:23.861 --> 59:26.330
LET'S GO, GUYS.
LET'S DO IT.

59:31.401 --> 59:33.704
SET LEFT,
SET LEFT.

59:33.704 --> 59:35.906
RED, 17...

59:37.507 --> 59:39.977
RED, 17...

59:39.977 --> 59:43.113
HUT--!
HUT! HUT!

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:31.261
Mikey:
WHEN I'M
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.263
I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY
ANY FOOTBALL.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:36.066
I'M JUST GOING
TO CONCENTRATE
ON CLASS RANK.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.972
WHAT DID YOU DO
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.408
I DID NOT GO
TO HIGH SCHOOL.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.913
WEREN'T THERE HIGH SCHOOLS
IN EL SALVADOR?

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:54.919
WE HAD TO WORK.
MY FAMILY WAS POOR.

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:57.688
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD BEING POOR.

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:01.325
I AM STILL POOR.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.728
HMMM.

01:01:03.728 --> 01:01:05.896
BUT, CONSUELO,

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:08.432
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE POOR,
DON'T YOU HAVE

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:12.236
ANY HOBBIES OR INTERESTS
OR ANYTHING?

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:14.805
NO, MIKEY.

01:01:14.805 --> 01:01:16.540
BUT, LIKE...

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.376
WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO
WHEN YOU'RE NOT WORKING?

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:23.881
I AM ALWAYS WORKING.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:27.484
BUT WHEN YOU'RE NOT,
LIKE NOW,

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:29.486
WHAT DO YOU
LIKE TO DO?

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:32.056
THIS IS WORK.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:34.959
BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE... REAL WORK.

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:37.762
THIS IS JUST
BABYSITTING.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:44.401
YOU KNOW, YOUR JOB'S
REALLY NOT SO BAD,

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:46.370
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.839
YOU SHOULD SMILE MORE.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:55.079
Toby:
When the sky is clear
and the sun is warm,

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:58.916
you're reminded of how
beautiful things can be.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:02.219
A lamppost...

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.521
a sign...

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:08.158
a straw wrapper,
blowing in the wind.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:11.695
But when that dark cloud
appears,

01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:13.730
you realize how fragile

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.133
the balance of life is.

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:18.969
When Brady first
arrived to the hospital,

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:21.438
He was unresponsive
to verbal stimuli.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:25.575
We performed a CT scan
which demonstrated a large

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.545
subdural hematoma
with mass effect.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:31.448
Since the removal
of the subdural,

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:33.818
he's been in a coma.

01:02:33.818 --> 01:02:37.587
When I first met the Livingstons
it was in the first 24 hours

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.590
of Brady coming in after
his tragic football accident,

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.527
and they were acting
in a fairly typical way.

01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:46.496
We're not the ones
that need the help.
My son needs help.

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:49.033
My son's in there.
He can't even feed himself.

01:02:49.033 --> 01:02:50.935
I don't even know
if he's going to be

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:53.137
a vegetable or not,
for Christ's sake!

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:55.339
Toby:
But what about Scooby?

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:57.541
How would this
affect him?

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:01.245
What meaning is to be
found in this?

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.556
THIS IS DEFINITELY
BETTER.

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:14.358
YOU THINK SO?
YOU DON'T THINK

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:16.360
THAT THIS MIGHT NOT
BE A LITTLE DRY?

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.562
THIS IS NOT
AN ENTERTAINMENT
YOU'RE MAKING, TOBY.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:20.564
THIS STORY ABOUT
A KID IN THE SUBURBS,

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:22.900
AND THE STATE
OF THE COLLEGE
ADMISSION PROCESS,

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.601
HAS, WITH THIS
BRADY CRISIS,

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:27.371
EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING
MUCH RICHER AND MORE
PROVOCATIVE.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:30.074
YES, I KNOW.
STILL, IT SHOULD BE
SOMEWHAT ENTERTAINING.

01:03:30.074 --> 01:03:33.410
WITHOUT THIS FOOTAGE,
WITHOUT THIS RIGOROUS
DOCUMENTATION,

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.479
IT WOULD FEEL
LIKE EXPLOITATION.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:38.482
NO, NO, NO.
NO EXPLOITATION,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:42.786
BUT DON'T YOU
FIND IT A LITTLE
FUNNY, TOO,

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:45.322
AT THE SAME TIME?

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.491
YOU'VE GOT
A FAMILY TRAGEDY
ON YOUR HANDS.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:50.660
WILL YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THAT?
ABOUT A KID IN A COMA?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.563
- NOTHING, I GUESS.
- WHY ARE YOU MAKING
THIS DOCUMENTARY

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:56.800
IF YOU CAN'T
TREAT YOUR SUBJECT
WITH APPROPRIATE GRAVITY?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.203
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:03.807
WE NEED TO SCREEN
WHAT WE'VE GOT.

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:06.143
INVITE SOME
REGULAR PEOPLE,

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:08.478
JUST SOME RANDOM
OFF-THE-STREET TYPES,

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:10.614
AND SEE
WHAT REAL PEOPLE
THINK OF THIS.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.350
I DON'T KNOW, TOBY.
WE REALLY HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.685
YOU STILL NEED TO GET
A LOT MORE FOOTAGE.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.354
IT'S PROBABLY
A LITTLE PREMATURE--

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:20.057
THEN WE CAN INVITE
SERIOUS INTELLECTUAL TYPES.

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:22.326
- WE'RE NOT READY.
- HIP ALTERNATIVE TYPES...

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:25.062
- WHO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS.
- TOBY, WE'RE NOT READY!

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:27.097
I NEED TO SEE THIS
WITH AN AUDIENCE.

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:29.900
WHAT'S AN AUDIENCE
GONNA TELL YOU?

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.237
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THEY'LL LIKE IT.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.312
CONSUELO!

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:18.515
I SPILLED
SOME GRAPE JUICE
ON THE FLOOR.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.953
CONSUELO?

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.342
CONSUELO?

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.988
- CONSUELO...
- ( sniffs )

01:05:57.988 --> 01:06:00.290
ARE YOU CRYING?

01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:03.327
NO.

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.795
YES, YOU ARE.
I CAN TELL.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.632
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:12.802
Mi Jesus.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.804
Mi Jesus.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.806
SPEAK ENGLISH.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:20.844
iMi Jesus estÃƒÂ¡ muerto!

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:23.513
CONSUELO,

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:26.950
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU KNOW
IF YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.286
I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND YOU.

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:34.891
MY JESUS.

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:37.094
WHO IS JESUS?

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:40.030
MY BABY.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.032
YOU HAVE A BABY?

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:45.569
MY GRANDCHILD BABY.

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:47.571
GEE.

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:50.640
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD ANY CHILDREN.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.078
BUT WHY ARE YOU
SO UPSET ABOUT JESUS?

01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:57.081
HE IS DEAD.

01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.849
OH.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.219
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:07.957
HE WAS EXECUTED.

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.660
HE WAS ON DEATH ROW...

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.764
AND THEN HE WAS EXECUTED.

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:17.434
HOW DID THEY EXECUTE HIM?

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:23.873
POISON GAS.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.110
MAYBE IT'S
FOR THE BEST.

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.977
I MEAN,
IF HE WAS GUILTY

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:30.147
OF DOING
SOMETHING WRONG.

01:07:30.147 --> 01:07:33.117
PEOPLE WHO ARE BAD
SHOULD BE KILLED.

01:07:33.117 --> 01:07:35.185
DON'T YOU
THINK SO?

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:37.621
JESUS WAS NOT BAD.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:41.558
MAYBE HE WAS AND YOU
JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.396
HE WASN'T.

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:49.733
BUT STILL,
YOU CAN'T BE SURE.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.535
I AM SURE.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.837
BUT REALLY,
YOU NEVER KNOW.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:56.173
I KNOW!

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:04.581
WHY WAS HE
ON DEATH ROW?

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:13.723
FOR RAPE AND MURDER.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:20.663
CONSUELO,
WHAT IS RAPE, EXACTLY?

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:29.506
IT IS WHEN YOU...
LOVE SOMEONE...

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:32.509
AND THEY DON'T
LOVE YOU,

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:36.645
AND YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:42.886
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
MY PARENTS DON'T LOVE ME.

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:48.158
WELL, THEN,
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:51.295
YOU CAN DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:01.871
( sobs )

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.673
CONSUELO?

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:06.776
I SPILLED SOME
GRAPE JUICE UPSTAIRS.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:10.647
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
CLEAN UP THE FLOOR NOW?

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:15.519
( tape playing )
* We're gonna have fun *

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:18.654
* We are gonna have
fun, fun, fun *

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:22.426
* In the sun,
sun, sun... *

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:28.163
DAD?

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:33.203
DO YOU THINK THAT BRADY
WILL EVER GET BETTER?

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.343
ONE IN A MILLION
RECOVER.

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:44.381
MAYBE HE'S THAT
ONE IN A MILLION.

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:48.017
MIKEY,
THERE'S OPTIMISM,

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.687
AND THEN THERE'S
STUPIDITY.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.988
IT'S A VERY
FINE LINE.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:56.125
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY HOPE
EITHER.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:59.629
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO MAKE
YOU FEEL BETTER.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:02.599
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:05.869
DAD?

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:10.574
WOULD YOU LET ME TRY
HYPNOTIZING YOU NOW?

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.345
YEAH, SURE.
GO AHEAD.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.314
HYPNOTIZE ME.

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.683
OKAY. STAY THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:28.492
Mikey:
JUST A SEC!

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:31.795
BE RIGHT THERE.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.968
COULD YOU
TURN AROUND TO ME?

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:41.471
JUST TURN.
THANKS.

01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:44.341
ALL RIGHT.

01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:48.412
YOU MUST LOOK
AT THIS SHINY OBJECT...

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:50.880
AND CONCENTRATE.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:54.951
RELAX YOUR LEGS.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.823
RELAX YOUR ARMS.

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.393
RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:06.930
NOW KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE SHINY OBJECT.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:11.935
YOUR EYELIDS
ARE GETTING HEAVY.

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:14.371
HEAVIER.

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:17.707
YOU'RE GETTING SLEEPY.

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:20.644
SLEEPIER.

01:11:20.644 --> 01:11:23.847
NOW LET YOUR EYES
CLOSE SHUT...

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:28.585
AND YOU ARE
SOUND ASLEEP.

01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:43.500
NOW...

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.970
YOU ARE COMPLETELY
UNDER MY POWER.

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:51.140
I AM THE ONLY VOICE
YOU CAN HEAR,

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.811
THE ONLY VOICE
YOU WILL LISTEN TO.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.513
NOW...

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:58.648
WHEN YOU WAKE UP,

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.385
YOU WILL BE
IN A GOOD MOOD.

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:04.521
YOU WON'T WORRY
SO MUCH ABOUT BRADY.

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:07.991
AND I WILL
BE YOUR FAVORITE
FROM NOW ON.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.959
IF BRADY DIES,

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:12.429
YOU CAN BE SAD
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.263
BUT I WILL STILL BE

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.933
THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON IN YOUR LIFE.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:19.302
YOU WILL NEVER
BE MEAN TO ME,

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:22.739
AND ALWAYS GIVE ME
WHATEVER I WANT.

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:26.309
ALSO, YOU SHOULD
FIRE CONSUELO.

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:28.311
SHE'S LAZY.

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:30.814
NOW, WHEN I SNAP
MY FINGERS,

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:33.082
YOU WILL REMEMBER
NOTHING,

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:36.720
BUT YOU WILL
DO EVERYTHING
I HAVE ASKED.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.455
ONE...

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:41.024
TWO...

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.728
THREE.
( snaps )

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.097
( sighs )

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.702
HEY, MIKEY,

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.904
WANT TO GET
SOME ICE CREAM?

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:56.806
OKAY!

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:04.614
It's like, yeah...

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.883
I caved in.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:09.486
I mean, I had to.

01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:11.755
My parents,
they're like...

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:15.492
still really
depressed about Brady.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:18.795
So I wrote
the bullshit essay,

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:22.031
filled out the applications,
did the interviews.

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:25.569
I figure I can
always drop out.

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:27.604
Toby:
Where did you get in?

01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:29.906
Princeton.

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:33.810
What did you get
on your SATs?

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.748
200 verbal,
710 math.

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:41.585
Kinda weird, I know,

01:13:41.585 --> 01:13:44.788
but I think they
thought it was, like...

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:50.259
good weird.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.795
We used pull.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.997
You have to.
Sometimes you just
have to, Toby.

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:56.466
What kind of pull
did you have?

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:59.536
I have a cousin.
Very big giver to
the alumni fund.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:01.471
It's all about
who you know.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.139
Look, we're not
suckers.

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:05.475
Everyone else is out there
doing the same thing.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:07.577
He's right.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:09.378
- DAMN, TOBY.
- IT'S TOO HARD.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:12.582
- THIS THING WON'T OPEN AGAIN.
- DON'T. LET ME TRY IT.

01:14:12.582 --> 01:14:15.852
IT'S-- YES,
THE BUTTON IS JUST STUCK.

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:18.187
- HEY, TOBY?
- HEY, MAN.

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.889
I WAS WONDERING...

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:22.458
IS THE DOCUMENTARY
ALMOST FINISHED?

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.494
YEAH, WE'RE
GETTING THERE.

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:27.296
CAN I SEE WHAT
YOU HAVE SO FAR?

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.298
SURE...

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.234
YEAH, AS SOON
AS I HAVE

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:33.436
A SCREENING,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

01:14:33.436 --> 01:14:35.404
- THANKS, MAN.
- OKAY, MAN.

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.674
OKAY.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.578
GIN, I WIN.

01:14:41.578 --> 01:14:43.813
LET'S PLAY AGAIN.

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:47.050
- Marty: HEY, MIKEY!
- HEY, DAD.

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.918
COME HERE
AND GIVE ME A HUG.

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:50.820
- GEE, YOU'RE HOME EARLY.
- YEAH.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.789
LISTEN, WHY DON'T
YOU GO UPSTAIRS

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:55.124
AND KEEP YOUR MOM
AND BRADY COMPANY
FOR A BIT?

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:57.661
I NEED TO SPEAK
ALONE WITH CONSUELO
FOR A MOMENT.

01:14:57.661 --> 01:14:59.929
- SURE, DAD.
- TAKE OFF.

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:02.131
AHEM--
CONSUELO...

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:14.177
MRS. LIVINGSTON AND I
HAVE DISCUSSED THIS,

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:16.980
AND WE'VE COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:19.883
THAT WE ARE NOT
VERY HAPPY WITH
YOUR WORK LATELY.

01:15:19.883 --> 01:15:22.952
SO WE'RE GOING
TO LET YOU GO.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.989
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:28.191
WE'VE BEEN HAPPY
WITH YOU IN THE PAST,

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.493
BUT NOW WE THINK, MAYBE
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE.

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:32.261
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD
TROUBLE AT HOME.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.264
MAYBE SOME OF THAT
IS REFLECTING
ON YOUR WORK.

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.366
Consuelo:
BUT, MR. LIVINGSTON--

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:40.970
( sobbing )
I WORK VERY HARD FOR YOU...
AND YOUR FAMILY.

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:42.972
Marty:
I UNDERSTAND.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.642
I'M SORRY IT HAD
TO END THIS WAY.

01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:34.958
( ringing )

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:37.861
FLORSHEIM,
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:16:37.861 --> 01:16:39.963
Hi, I'm trying
to reach Toby Oxman.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:41.564
SORRY,
HE'S OFF TODAY.

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:43.599
OKAY.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:47.503
UM... THANKS.

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:49.505
( phone clicks )

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.376
* I'M COMING OVER
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION *

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:56.646
* I ONLY WANT TO BE THE CENTER
OF YOUR ATTENTION *

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:59.683
* FOR LONG ENOUGH TO SHOW YOU
I'M WORTH THE TROUBLE *

01:16:59.683 --> 01:17:01.918
* THAT YOU TAKE *

01:17:01.918 --> 01:17:05.054
* I WANT TO SEE THE WAY
THAT YOU PORTRAY *

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:08.291
* A BOY WHO'S GONNA TRY
TO CHANGE HIS LIFE TODAY... *

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.259
HEY, MIKE.

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.261
IS TOBY HERE?

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:14.363
NO, HE'S NOT.

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.132
OH.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:18.802
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE MIGHT BE?

01:17:18.802 --> 01:17:21.270
I THINK HE'S AT
A TEST SCREENING.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.073
* I WANT TO SEE THE WAY
THAT YOU PORTRAY *

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:27.343
* A BOY WHO MAYBE DOESN'T
HAVE TOO MUCH TO SAY *

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:30.179
* AND YOU CAN DRAW
YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS *

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:32.481
* BUT YOU'LL FIND
I'M NOT A FAKE *

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.884
* YOU CAN TURN AWAY
FROM ME *

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:37.921
* BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT'LL
KEEP ME HERE, YOU KNOW *

01:17:37.921 --> 01:17:40.323
* AND YOU'LL NEVER BE
THE CITY GUY *

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:44.460
* ANY MORE THAN I'LL BE
HOSTING THE SCOOBY SHOW. *

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.429
( crowd laughing )

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.733
Marty:
I think Scooby's
like a lot of kids.

01:17:49.733 --> 01:17:51.500
He just hit a speedbump.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.037
Now he's going to find his way,
his path's going to be clear,

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:57.306
and I think he's going
to continue his education
at a good college.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:00.276
And everybody else
is going to be happy.

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:04.380
Toby:
Mr. Livingston,

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.784
aren't you a bit fearful
that Scooby will be
confronted with

01:18:07.784 --> 01:18:09.886
hollow values
and systemic conformism?

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:12.121
( scattered chuckles
throughout )

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:15.391
I don't know why this is
so hard for you to comprehend.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:17.360
I had a terrific time
in college.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.863
I've got a terrific job,
a comfortable salary,

01:18:19.863 --> 01:18:21.998
terrific wife,
three terrific kids,

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:24.533
and every year I give
to the alumni fund.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:28.104
Now, why are you trying to make
college out to be a bad thing?

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.006
A negative experience?

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:32.275
You had a bad time?
Well, too bad!

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:35.879
Get over it!
Stop trying to impose

01:18:35.879 --> 01:18:38.014
your misery on others
by going around saying,

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:40.383
"Life is bad.
Life is horrible."

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:42.952
Life is tough on you?
Well, boo-hoo!

01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:44.788
( laughter )

01:18:44.788 --> 01:18:46.990
Scooby:
Well, yeah.

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:49.358
My dad is kind
of a goofball.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:51.360
You just have to...

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.030
pretend to go along
with his ideas,

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:57.233
'cause he really
doesn't get it.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:00.770
Like, I could be
the next Oprah...

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:02.738
- for all he knows,
- ( laughter )

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.774
but he's never even
seen the show.

01:19:05.608 --> 01:19:09.779
Toby:
What is most
important to you?

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.915
I don't know.

01:19:11.915 --> 01:19:14.851
I'd like to be good
at something.

01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:19.655
It doesn't have to be TV.
I mean...

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:21.724
it could be movies...

01:19:21.724 --> 01:19:23.893
anything.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:26.062
I'd be willing
to direct.

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.397
( raucous laughter )

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.501
I'd like to be...

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.537
you know...

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:37.073
famous.

01:19:38.942 --> 01:19:41.878
Not necessarily
a superstar.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.549
Just famous.

01:19:48.952 --> 01:19:51.320
Be recognized.

01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:55.691
Get fan mail--

01:19:55.691 --> 01:19:57.293
things.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.328
Scooby, now I understand
how you want

01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:01.564
to be like a TV
talk show host and all,

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.232
like Conan O'Brien,

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:05.902
but did you know that
even he went to college?

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:09.605
- He did?
- Yeah.

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:12.175
- He went to Harvard.
- ( audience guffaws )

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:13.442
Oh.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:15.444
( laughter rises )

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:20.049
( audience applauds )

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:27.823
Newscaster:
...one police officer,
eight others were wounded...

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.027
MOM? DAD?

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:35.865
- I'M SCARED.
- SURE, BUDDY.

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:37.800
- COME ON.
- COME IN BED WITH US.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.936
COME ON.

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:42.872
SNUG AS A BUG
IN A RUG,

01:20:43.873 --> 01:20:46.342
YEAH,
THERE YOU GO, PALLY.

01:20:50.413 --> 01:20:53.216
Marty:
YOU'RE MONSTER-PROOFED.

01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:34.657
( gas hissing )

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:41.457
( crowd chattering )

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.193
( police radios chattering )

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.018
SCOOBY...

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:11.154
OH MY GOD,
SCOOBY.

01:23:11.154 --> 01:23:13.156
I'M SO SORRY.

01:23:13.156 --> 01:23:15.624
I'M SO,
SO SORRY.

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:18.027
DON'T BE.

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:22.331
The movie's a hit.

01:23:29.372 --> 01:23:32.708
( jazzy piano music )

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:37.713
* PICTURE A SCENE
IN YOUR MIND *

01:23:37.713 --> 01:23:40.916
* LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE
AND TAKE NOTE *

01:23:40.916 --> 01:23:42.918
* OF THE SETTING BEHIND *

01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:45.388
* LISTEN, WATCH AND WAIT *

01:23:45.388 --> 01:23:48.191
* A PLOT BEGINS
TO TAKE SHAPE *

01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:49.858
* THERE'S A STORY,
AND THEN *

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.960
* CHARACTERS
WILL COME TO YOU *

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.897
* RELATING EVENTS
AS THEY CHOOSE TO *

01:23:54.897 --> 01:23:57.633
* BUT ALL THEIR WORDS
AND ACTIONS *

01:23:57.633 --> 01:24:01.237
* COME ENTIRELY FROM YOU *

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:08.344
* IF YOU'RE A STORYTELLER,
YOU MIGHT THINK *

01:24:08.344 --> 01:24:10.146
* YOU'RE WITHOUT-- *

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:13.916
* RESPONSIBILITY, AND YOU
CAN LEAD YOUR CHARACTERS *

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.618
* ANYWHERE YOU WANT *

01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:18.554
* YOU HAVE IMMUNITY *

01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:26.462
* HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THE WAY *

01:24:26.462 --> 01:24:29.465
* PEOPLE MIGHT REACT
TO ALL THE THINGS *

01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:31.467
* THAT YOUR CHARACTERS SAY? *

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:33.836
* AND ARE THEIR ACTIONS
HAND IN HAND *

01:24:33.836 --> 01:24:36.572
* WITH WHAT YOU WANTED
TO PORTRAY? *

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.841
* ARE YOU SICK?
ARE YOU CRIPPLED, INSANE? *

01:24:38.841 --> 01:24:43.912
* EXPRESSING THE DESIRES
THAT DAREN'T SPEAK THEIR NAME *

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:48.517
* ARE YOU THE ONE
TO BE BLAMED? *

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:52.388
* NOW YOU'RE A STORYTELLER,
YOU MIGHT THINK *

01:24:52.388 --> 01:24:54.257
* YOU'RE WITHOUT-- *

01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:58.461
* RESPONSIBILITY, BUT IN
DIRECTIONS, ACTIONS AND WORDS *

01:24:58.461 --> 01:25:00.463
* CAUSE AND EFFECT *

01:25:00.463 --> 01:25:03.199
* YOU NEED CONSISTENCY *

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:16.812
* HOW CAN YOU FINISH
THE TALE? *

01:25:16.812 --> 01:25:18.947
* LIVES WHICH HAVE
PLAYED A PART *

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:22.151
* ARE SUMMARIZED
FROM THE VERY START *

01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:24.487
* AND EPISODES LEFT OUT *

01:25:24.487 --> 01:25:27.356
* TO MAKE IT ALL
GO YOUR WAY *

01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:29.425
* IT'S A MIGHTY BIG WORLD *

01:25:29.425 --> 01:25:32.428
* SOME OF IT I'VE SEEN *

01:25:32.428 --> 01:25:34.363
* BUT MOSTLY
I'VE ONLY HEARD *

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:40.336
* AND STORIES ARE ALL FICTION
FROM THEIR MOMENT OF BIRTH *

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:48.711
* YOU'RE JUST A STORYTELLER,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO ESCAPE *

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:53.716
* RESPONSIBILITY, IF WE BELIEVE
YOU THEN YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL *

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:56.985
* BUT YOU DON'T MAKE
CLAIMS OF VERITY *

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.789
* YOU'RE JUST A STORYTELLER,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO ESCAPE *

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:05.761
* RESPONSIBILITY, IF WE BELIEVE
YOU THEN YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL *

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:09.332
