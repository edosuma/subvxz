over speakers  )

02:14.208 --> 02:15.917
Top that off
for you, honey?

02:17.542 --> 02:19.208
There you go.

02:26.542 --> 02:28.417
( indistinct talking  )

02:32.208 --> 02:34.375
( sighs  )

03:38.291 --> 03:40.041
, ,
What's in the case?

03:42.792 --> 03:44.458
I'm sorry?

03:46.458 --> 03:48.542
You're always lugging
that case around.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.500
I'm curious,
what do you sell?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.834
I'm in restaurant supplies.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.583
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.583
You must travel a lot, huh?

03:57.667 --> 04:00.291
Whole country
or just hereabouts?

04:02.291 --> 04:04.041
I don't mean
to be rude, but--

04:04.125 --> 04:06.083
How's your wife feel about it?

04:07.166 --> 04:08.875
What?
She must get lonely.

04:08.959 --> 04:10.667
You gone all the time. Does she?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.750
Look, I--
Do you get lonely?

04:12.834 --> 04:14.750
You miss fucking her,
Harold?

04:14.834 --> 04:18.083
Look, I don't know who you are,
but you can't just sit down--

04:18.166 --> 04:20.541
Did it myself.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.083
Kind of a hobby.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.083
Take a look
at these pictures, Harold,

04:25.166 --> 04:27.709
and you tell me if you see
anything you want.

04:27.792 --> 04:30.458
I've got lots more.

04:30.542 --> 04:32.041
Would you like to see them?

04:36.792 --> 04:38.250
Tell me, those jokes
about the traveling salesman

04:38.333 --> 04:39.834
and the farmer's daughter,
are they true?

04:42.709 --> 04:45.250
Here. This one's
my favorite! Ha!

04:45.333 --> 04:47.750
Really says it all.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.166
Wouldn't you agree?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.792
You are sick.

04:53.875 --> 04:54.834
( knocks over cup  )

04:54.917 --> 04:57.667
It's a matter of opinion.

MAN: There's a rest stop
next off-ramp.

07:22.792 --> 07:23.959
Pull into it.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.583
Look, I have money.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.583
It's not a lot.
Nobody wants your money, Harold.

07:27.667 --> 07:30.083
Just pull in.
Why?

07:32.000 --> 07:36.166
Because I wouldn't want
to do this at 70 miles an hour.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.583
It could be dangerous.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.041

Welcome to Albuquerque.

08:08.041 --> 08:09.583
Rick Charleton.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.792
Miss Payton's the nice girl
at the front desk.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.500
She puts together a package
for all the new agents.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.625
Everything you need
to know about the area,

08:18.709 --> 08:20.625
help with finding
apartments and such.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.834
This one's yours.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.333
Okay.

08:23.417 --> 08:25.125
I'm gonna get it
all set up for you.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.542
All right.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.583
Not that different
from Dallas, is it?

08:30.750 --> 08:32.625
No, sir.

08:32.708 --> 08:34.125
If you need anything, just yell.

08:34.207 --> 08:36.250
Thanks.

08:38.792 --> 08:42.082
( phones ringing,
people speaking indistinctly  )

08:50.792 --> 08:52.709
I'm Tom, guys.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.667
Nice to meet you, Tom.
Don here.

Hello.

Oh...

I'm Bill.

09:08.291 --> 09:09.583
Hey, Bill. Tom.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.208
Tom, do you like
Frito pies?

09:12.291 --> 09:15.625
I don't know, Bill.
I don't know what they are.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.083
Welcome to the minors.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.083
Let me do that.
Ah, thank you.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.625
Sure.
Don't know how to make coffee.

10:18.709 --> 10:19.709
That's okay.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.250
It takes some experience.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.709
( chuckles  ):
Yeah.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.250
Isn't there a Starbucks
around here?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.083
That's a joke, right?

10:26.166 --> 10:29.291
( laughs  ) Yeah.
Yeah, that's a joke.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.959
So... you're Mackelway?

10:32.041 --> 10:33.917
Yeah, Agent Mackelway.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.375
Katie Payton.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.333
Hi.

10:39.417 --> 10:42.625
A fax is coming in for you.
It's the room next door.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.125
Really? Fax for me?

10:44.208 --> 10:46.625
Yeah.
Okay.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.291
Thank you.
No problem.

10:48.375 --> 10:50.291
Nice meeting you.
Yeah.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.125
You gonna stand around all day,

11:34.208 --> 11:35.875
or you wanna do something?

11:37.375 --> 11:39.417
No, sir.

MAN: Afternoon, Rick.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.166
Looks like
a robbery-homicide.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.834
Body's back
over there.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.458
You run
the plates?

12:12.667 --> 12:14.750
Fella's named
Harold Speck.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.333
Traveling salesman
from T or C.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.333
T or C?

12:19.417 --> 12:21.166
Truth or Consequences.

12:21.250 --> 12:24.250
It's a town, slick.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.792
Gotta write that down.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.542
,
( winch motor whining  )

12:44.625 --> 12:46.333
Hey!

12:48.291 --> 12:49.709
What the fuck are you doing?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.458
What's it look like, bud?

12:54.625 --> 12:56.333
You ever heard
of evidentiary procedure?

12:58.458 --> 13:00.250
MAN ( on tape player  ):
Icarus case number 690.

Physicians in charge,

13:02.125 --> 13:06.417
Dr. Galin J. Peterson
and Dr. Ferdinand Kovoskis.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.417
Theta-wave entrainment

13:09.500 --> 13:13.166
to be used with GPS
for target management.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.458
Session to commence

13:15.542 --> 13:20.959

three, two...

13:21.041 --> 13:22.750
one...

13:22.834 --> 13:24.208

from tape player  )

13:37.083 --> 13:39.542
Target number, write it now.

13:40.917 --> 13:43.542
Focus.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.667
Stay objective.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.208
Smells like clove.

13:57.917 --> 14:01.125
( thunder rumbles  )

14:03.709 --> 14:04.834
Okay.

14:04.917 --> 14:07.041
( warbling sound continues  )

14:07.125 --> 14:09.542
Describe. Describe it.

14:09.625 --> 14:10.834
Short.

14:10.917 --> 14:13.000
One word.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.750
One word.

14:21.458 --> 14:24.542
( mysterious theme playing  )

14:33.917 --> 14:36.417

14:45.000 --> 14:47.709
Draw the environment.

14:47.792 --> 14:50.709
One target at a time.

14:50.792 --> 14:54.083
One target at a time.

14:54.166 --> 14:58.291
Draw the environment.
Draw the environment now.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.125
Sir.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.667
I'm sort of a stickler
for procedure.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.792
I imagine you would be.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.125
Christ!

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
See it.

15:27.625 --> 15:30.917
See it. Draw it now.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.333
Draw it now.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.667
Draw it now.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.333
MACKELWAY: The shoes are
on the wrong feet.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.458
All American Diner,
Gallup,

15:48.500 --> 15:50.375
New Mexico.
CHARLETON: Passed that

15:50.500 --> 15:51.834
on the way here.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.208
Well, he had breakfast there
this morning.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.834

children playing in distance  )

16:17.166 --> 16:19.834
( O'Ryan sketching  )

16:50.208 --> 16:52.417
MAN ( on radio  ):  Starting off
the bottom of the inning,

16:52.500 --> 16:53.917
Barry Matthews.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.417
Got on base
with a line-drive single

16:55.500 --> 16:57.333
his last at bat.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.625
And he takes the first pitch
high and inside for ball one.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.000
Looked like Leonard
was trying to get

17:02.083 --> 17:03.917
the breaking pitch inside,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.834
but it just didn't have any
break on it that time.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.208
( shuts off radio  )

17:15.000 --> 17:16.333
CHARLETON:
Agent Mackelway.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.040
We're over here.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.125
I was gonna introduce you two,

17:21.208 --> 17:23.583
but I understand
that won't be necessary.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.791
Seems your former office

17:24.875 --> 17:26.290
decided we could use
a little help,

17:26.375 --> 17:28.000
so they sent us Agent Kulok.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.542
Hey, Tom.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.250
Hi, Fran.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.792
I guess we're gonna skip
the tearful reunion.

17:37.875 --> 17:40.208
Have a seat, Tom.

17:47.125 --> 17:48.792
How are things back in Dallas?

17:48.875 --> 17:52.166
Wouldn't really know.
I've been chained to a desk.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.709
Okay. What do we know?

17:54.792 --> 17:56.959
Picked up a footprint
in the back seat of Speck's car.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.166
A size and a half
bigger than Speck's.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.709
CHARLETON: Okay.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.834
Wounds on Speck's throat

18:02.917 --> 18:04.500
indicate he was strangled
from behind.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.041
I think our guy was waiting
for him in the back seat,

18:07.125 --> 18:09.417
sprung this on him
once the car was moving.

18:09.500 --> 18:13.250
Lab picked up talcum traces
along the edges of the paper

18:13.333 --> 18:14.667
consistent with
powdered gloves.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.542
So he gets this dropped
in his lap,

18:16.625 --> 18:19.667
it spooks him,
car ends up in the ravine.

18:19.750 --> 18:23.083
That car was pushed
to the state line.

18:23.166 --> 18:25.834
The depth
of the tire tracks.

18:25.917 --> 18:28.750
Footprints near
the embankment.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.250
That car wasn't going

18:30.333 --> 18:31.667
more than three miles an hour,
and it stopped,

18:31.750 --> 18:33.959
quite literally,
on the state line.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.375
Guy must've used GPS.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.667
Why would he do this? Why would
he push it to the state line?

18:39.750 --> 18:41.250
Same reason
he did everything else.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.875
To get the FBI's
undivided attention.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.041
There's
an association here.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.291
You have a circle...

18:49.333 --> 18:51.083
and a lidless eye...

18:51.166 --> 18:53.125
that's always open.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.625
Seeing.

18:55.625 --> 18:56.959
Seeing.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.333
Or making sure
that we're seeing.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.458
It's just a feeling.

19:04.542 --> 19:07.250
WAITRESS:
He was a normal guy.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.625
You know,
kinda quiet.

19:08.709 --> 19:10.583
He liked to read
fishing magazines.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.792
And he wasn't much
of a tipper.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.250
Is that a lousy thing
to say?

19:14.333 --> 19:15.625
No, it's fine.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.709
What can you tell us
about the other man?

19:17.792 --> 19:19.917
Like I said,
I never really saw him.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.208
Harold came up
complaining about the guy,

19:22.291 --> 19:24.917
but by the time I turned around,
he was gone.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.750
Can you desc--?
Desc--

19:27.834 --> 19:29.417
Can you describe
him, ma'am?

19:29.500 --> 19:31.125
WAITRESS: Oh, sure.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.333
You could just tell he wasn't
from around here, you know?

19:33.417 --> 19:35.083
Did you happen to see
what he was driving?

19:35.166 --> 19:37.667
You know,
now that you mention it,

19:37.750 --> 19:39.458
there's a Torino

19:39.542 --> 19:40.917
out in the parking lot

19:41.000 --> 19:42.625
with a real crappy paint job.

19:42.709 --> 19:45.166
It's been here
since last night.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.125
We really need a protocol
for interviewing witnesses.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.834
Fine. I'll handle it
from now on.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.417
Oh, I see how it is,
always in control.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.458
I'll tell you something, Tom,
I want my life back.

19:53.542 --> 19:54.750
So I want this over quick.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.333
So, what happened?

19:58.583 --> 20:00.375
Your ring.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.291
It didn't work out.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.208
Just like us.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.250
So why
are you here?

20:12.458 --> 20:14.291
You vacationing in Albuquerque?

20:14.375 --> 20:17.542
Oh, Tom, you sure haven't
changed in six whole months.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.667
Keys are in the car.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.208
I don't need a babysitter,
so if we're gonna do this,

20:22.291 --> 20:24.041
let's do it right this time.

20:24.125 --> 20:27.166
Well, then don't make things so
unnecessarily complicated again.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.500
Trunk's ajar.
You listening to me?

20:30.583 --> 20:31.959
You think
I wanna be down here?

20:32.041 --> 20:34.375
I'm not interested
in hanging out with you.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.709
And I'm not your babysitter.
I'm your partner.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.125
I didn't put you here. Remember.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.792
And I'm not going through this
again with you.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.250
Holy shit!

MACKELWAY ( whispers  ):

I need help down here.

21:01.792 --> 21:02.834
What's your 20?

21:02.917 --> 21:04.709

in Gallup.

got an ID on our body.

21:16.291 --> 21:19.000
Barney Fulcher, age 50,

21:19.083 --> 21:20.709
sixth-grade teacher
from Boulder, Colorado.

21:20.792 --> 21:22.208
These plates
aren't gonna help us.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.542
Forget them. This guy
started in Oklahoma.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.583
Left these for us.

O'RYAN: Mrs. Speck.

21:52.792 --> 21:56.291
I just heard.
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

21:56.375 --> 21:59.208
I didn't know him well,
but I think Harold was

21:59.291 --> 22:02.625
a much more complex person
than people realize.

22:02.709 --> 22:04.750
MRS. SPECK: He was,
wasn't he?

22:04.834 --> 22:07.291
I'm really sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

22:07.375 --> 22:08.750
Thank you.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.458
Thank you so much.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.041
KULOK:
So it wasn't
Fulcher's car?

23:01.125 --> 23:04.000
MACKELWAY:
Uh-uh. Car was registered
to a Daniel Dyson.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.375

in Oklahoma City.

Daniel Dyson?

23:49.834 --> 23:52.500
( man plays "chopsticks"
on piano  )

23:56.750 --> 23:58.667
Hello?

23:58.750 --> 24:00.792
MAN ( yelling  ): Fucking freak!

24:01.959 --> 24:05.375
What a fucking freak!

24:05.458 --> 24:07.417
What a fucking freak.

24:08.625 --> 24:10.250
Can I help you?

24:18.625 --> 24:21.250
Why didn't you report it
as stolen?

24:21.333 --> 24:24.083
Truth is
I always hated that car.

24:24.166 --> 24:27.041
Nobody but Benjamin could ever
make it run right anyway.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.875
Is that his name?
Benjamin?

24:28.959 --> 24:30.208
That's hard to say.

24:30.291 --> 24:32.208
That's what he liked
to be called.

24:32.291 --> 24:34.667

24:37.000 --> 24:38.959
Oh, this bad wiring!

24:45.667 --> 24:47.583
KULOK: I think we've got
an obsessive-compulsive here.

24:47.667 --> 24:49.250
I'm gonna call Grieves,

24:49.333 --> 24:51.750
get him to work up a list of
behaviorists for us to talk to.

24:51.834 --> 24:53.542
Okay. Give me that.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.542
Excuse me.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.417
MACKELWAY:
This came from Benjamin?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.583
DYSON: He used to spend hours
down here.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.625
It was like-- Like his office.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.625
What are these?

25:11.709 --> 25:13.083
With those numbers
and pictures,

25:13.166 --> 25:14.792
he said he could
find anybody.

25:18.709 --> 25:20.625
Benjamin O'Ryan?

25:20.709 --> 25:22.291
Special Agent Benjamin O'Ryan,

25:22.375 --> 25:24.750

25:24.834 --> 25:26.834

PROSECUTOR:
Agent Mackelway, what the fuck
were you thinking?

27:34.333 --> 27:36.083
He's got nine murders
in his back pocket

27:36.166 --> 27:38.041

28:45.458 --> 28:47.000
that you could cross the border
into Mexico

28:47.083 --> 28:48.875
without an extradition order?

28:48.959 --> 28:51.375
I knew he was gonna buy off
a magistrate

28:51.458 --> 28:52.500
and disappear into Mexico.

28:52.583 --> 28:54.375
PROSECUTOR: You knew?

28:54.458 --> 28:56.834
Agent Mackelway, you have
shamed and vilified this bureau

28:56.917 --> 28:58.166
with your unorthodox methods.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.709

that you be suspended

you will undergo mandatory
psychological evaluation.

30:07.834 --> 30:10.291

Yeah, I got it.

30:12.834 --> 30:14.375

39:56.750 --> 39:58.041
( sighs  )

39:58.125 --> 40:00.125
I'm trying to see it.

40:00.208 --> 40:02.750
I'm trying to see it.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.125
( sighs  )

40:18.709 --> 40:20.375
He opens up an old wound.

40:20.458 --> 40:21.750
Yeah.

40:21.834 --> 40:23.667
What does he want?

40:23.750 --> 40:25.500
I don't know.

40:25.583 --> 40:28.375
Maybe he's got something against
the bureau or law enforcement,

40:28.458 --> 40:30.417
like the Zodiac.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.917
"You're welcome, Tom.
You're welcome, Tom."

40:33.000 --> 40:35.709
Not FBI. Tom.
He's baiting me. He wants me.

40:35.792 --> 40:37.041
Why?

40:37.125 --> 40:38.834
What does he want?

40:38.917 --> 40:40.166
Okay.

40:41.792 --> 40:44.208
Tom, I want you
to take me through this.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.875
Explain this to me.

40:46.959 --> 40:49.458
Okay. See if this makes sense
to you, okay?

40:51.125 --> 40:53.750
Each of the 45 abduction dates
on these faxes

40:53.834 --> 40:57.583
correspond to one of the GPS
coordinates on O'Ryan's map.

40:57.667 --> 40:59.375
What about the two bodies
we just ID'd?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.417
Okay, well,
let's find the faxes.

41:03.667 --> 41:04.959
Here we go.

41:05.041 --> 41:08.125
Male victim.
Last seen, Trenton, New Jersey.

41:08.208 --> 41:09.125
Okay.

41:09.208 --> 41:10.250
Found in Dyersville, Iowa.

41:10.333 --> 41:11.458
Okay. Female.

41:11.542 --> 41:13.583
Last seen, Dayton, Ohio.

41:13.667 --> 41:14.917
Found in Brownsville,
Texas.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.250
So we have two bodies

41:17.333 --> 41:20.375
that were found a thousand miles
from where they were last seen.

41:20.458 --> 41:21.625
What's this?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.208
That's Tucumcari,
New Mexico.

41:24.291 --> 41:25.750
Why blue?

41:25.834 --> 41:27.583
That's the only city
where the date on the fax

41:27.667 --> 41:29.458
and the date on the map
didn't correspond.

41:32.834 --> 41:34.583
Date of disappearance:
Christmas.

41:34.667 --> 41:35.792
On O'Ryan's map,

41:35.875 --> 41:38.208
8-27.

41:39.959 --> 41:41.583
CHARLETON:
The only thing we know

41:41.667 --> 41:44.458
is there never was
a Benjamin O'Ryan, FBI.

41:44.542 --> 41:47.458
That's too bad. He would've
made a hell of an agent.

41:47.542 --> 41:51.208
Autopsy reports just arrived
for both the new positive IDs.

41:53.583 --> 41:55.166
Bruises?
No. They're burn marks.

41:55.250 --> 41:58.291
We've got them here, too,
on our female from Dayton.

41:58.375 --> 42:01.125
CHARLETON: And these marks
relate to the marks found

42:01.208 --> 42:02.458
on Fulcher
and Speck how?

42:02.542 --> 42:04.083
They don't.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.792
There are no burn marks
on Speck, Fulcher or Starkey.

42:05.875 --> 42:08.000
And we have no slash-circles
here on these bodies.

42:09.375 --> 42:11.291
CHARLETON: Right.

42:11.375 --> 42:15.542
My office, as soon as someone
finds something useful.

42:17.250 --> 42:20.500

GRIEVES: No luck

42:22.166 --> 42:23.417

42:23.500 --> 42:26.500
But I do have
a couple other leads

42:26.583 --> 42:28.000
that I'm following up on,

42:28.083 --> 42:29.125
and I'm really hopeful
they're gonna pan out.

42:29.208 --> 42:30.625
Great. Thank you.

42:30.709 --> 42:33.458
PAYTON: Um, a professor
of criminal biology,

42:33.542 --> 42:35.291
Professor Daitz
just called.

42:37.917 --> 42:40.208
He says he's got time
for you on Saturday.

42:42.083 --> 42:44.458
Thank you, Katie.

42:44.542 --> 42:45.959
MACKELWAY: You'll have to
forgive me, professor.

42:46.041 --> 42:47.500
I've been operating
under the assumption

42:47.583 --> 42:49.291
that O'Ryan was somebody's
delusional fantasy.

42:49.375 --> 42:50.834
DAITZ: Oh, no. He's real.

42:50.917 --> 42:53.792
He was a student of mine.
That fax you sent me,

42:53.875 --> 42:55.959
this circle with
a slash through it?

42:56.041 --> 42:58.000
That's his construct,
his theory.

42:58.083 --> 43:01.667
He called it "Suspect Zero."

43:01.750 --> 43:04.500
Suspect Zero?

43:04.583 --> 43:07.500
He posited a theory
that a serial killer

43:07.583 --> 43:11.166
could cross the entire country
without ever getting caught.

43:11.250 --> 43:12.750
Look, what makes
a killer catchable?

43:12.834 --> 43:15.166
Patterns, repetition
of behavior.

43:15.250 --> 43:16.709
He imagined someone
with no patterns,

43:16.792 --> 43:19.208
no telltale fetishes,
no rituals,

43:19.291 --> 43:22.417
just a random killing machine
that never leaves a clue.

43:22.500 --> 43:25.041
Yeah, but a serial killer,
by definition,

43:25.083 --> 43:26.667
is condemned to repetition,
isn't he?

43:26.750 --> 43:28.709
I mean, isn't that
what he's all about?

43:28.792 --> 43:30.583
Well, he is until he isn't.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.250
And this Suspect Zero,

43:33.333 --> 43:36.166
is that something
that you believe in, doctor?

43:36.250 --> 43:37.542
It's something
O'Ryan believed in.

43:37.625 --> 43:39.250
I mean, he swore
guys like that existed,

43:39.333 --> 43:40.792
only we couldn't see them

43:40.917 --> 43:43.500
because, uh, they didn't obey
the usual laws,

43:43.625 --> 43:46.208
like cancer doesn't,
or the HIV virus

43:46.291 --> 43:49.542
that tricks your immune system
into thinking it isn't there.

43:49.625 --> 43:52.750
So now you're saying
a guy like that could exist?

43:52.792 --> 43:54.834
Do you know the definition
of a black hole?

43:54.959 --> 43:56.333
Not precisely, no.

43:56.458 --> 43:57.667
It's a celestial body

43:57.792 --> 44:00.458
with a gravitational force
so strong

44:00.500 --> 44:01.917
that nothing escapes it,

44:01.959 --> 44:03.542
not even light.

44:03.625 --> 44:06.250
Well, then, how do you find
something you can't see?

44:06.333 --> 44:10.208
Well, it was there
and we found it.

44:10.291 --> 44:13.041
So why do you think
O'Ryan is so convinced

44:13.083 --> 44:14.333
a person like that's
really around?

44:14.458 --> 44:15.834
In this time,
in this place.

44:15.959 --> 44:17.250
I mean, what about
a split personality?

44:17.333 --> 44:19.542
Could you have
a stone-cold killer on one hand

44:19.625 --> 44:23.709
and a thoughtful man
with a conscience on the other?

44:23.792 --> 44:28.208
I mean, could O'Ryan
possibly be this Suspect Zero?

44:28.291 --> 44:30.166
Yeah.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.583
That's a viable theory.

44:31.667 --> 44:33.583
I mean,
the point is,

44:33.667 --> 44:36.917
I don't think you're gonna
know until you find O'Ryan.

of Harold A. Speck,

58:03.458 --> 58:05.000
the traveling salesman

58:05.083 --> 58:07.375
from Truth or Consequences,
New Mexico.

58:07.458 --> 58:09.083
They were mostly teenagers.

58:09.166 --> 58:11.000
More than half were runaways.

58:11.083 --> 58:12.583
The revelation that Speck
was a serial killer

58:12.667 --> 58:14.375
led us to examine
Barney Fulcher,

58:14.458 --> 58:16.333
the victim that
Agent Kulok and I found

58:16.417 --> 58:18.542
at the All American Diner.

58:18.625 --> 58:21.417
After an extensive search
of his home and property,

58:21.500 --> 58:23.583
we found the remains
of nine people,

58:23.667 --> 58:27.750
mostly boys between
the ages of 9 and 14.

58:27.834 --> 58:30.917
The last victim,
Raymond Starkey,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.125
who vanished after
his acquittal six months ago,

58:33.208 --> 58:34.917
we all know about.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.709
Sir, for some reason,

58:36.792 --> 58:38.583
this man is identifying
and targeting serial killers.

58:38.667 --> 58:40.125
CHARLETON:
Not necessarily.

58:40.208 --> 58:42.041
We got two other bodies
from Santa Fe,

58:42.125 --> 58:43.375
so it looks like killers
aren't his only victims.

58:43.458 --> 58:45.083
MACKELWAY:
But we don't know

58:45.166 --> 58:46.625
that those bodies had anything
to do with O'Ryan.

58:46.709 --> 58:48.375
Let's stick
to what we do know.

58:48.458 --> 58:50.417
He's a transient with
a history of mental illness.

58:50.500 --> 58:53.125
He also happens to think he's
a former agent of this bureau.

58:53.208 --> 58:56.959
I want this man
apprehended now.

59:05.333 --> 59:09.166
( announcer on radio
speaking indistinctly  )

59:09.250 --> 59:11.792
ANNOUNCER ( on radio  ):
Swung on and missed.
Strike two.

59:11.875 --> 59:13.500
Slipped on that one.

59:13.583 --> 59:14.959
( siren wailing in distance  )

59:15.041 --> 59:17.291
Next one up.
Here's the wind-up.

59:17.375 --> 59:19.417
Swung on and missed.
Strike three.

59:19.500 --> 59:21.625
( siren approaching  )

59:21.709 --> 59:23.458
Even though he did
hit over .300

59:23.542 --> 59:25.458
his previous three seasons,

59:25.542 --> 59:27.792
it wasn't until last year
that he made the all-star team.

59:27.875 --> 59:32.083
( announcer continues
speaking indistinctly )

59:32.166 --> 59:35.709
Just misses on the outside
corner. Ball two.

59:45.083 --> 59:49.667
MALE OFFICER ( on radio  ):
Sergeant, copy that.
Possible stolen vehicle.

59:49.750 --> 59:54.000
We are checking NCIC right now
for wanted warrants.

59:54.083 --> 59:57.291
( female officer on radio
speaking indistinctly  )

01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:03.000
Good afternoon.

01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:04.959
Afternoon, officer.

01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:07.000
See your
driver's license, sir?

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:09.000
Of course.

01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.959
Is there a problem?

01:00:17.542 --> 01:00:19.333
Could I see your
registration, please?

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:21.417
Sure.

01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:24.208
( glove compartment unlatches  )

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.250
( papers rustling  )

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:30.709
You mind stepping out
of the car, please?

01:00:30.792 --> 01:00:32.458
( closes glove compartment  )

01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:44.166
Officer,
I'm carrying something

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.875
that could be construed
as a weapon.

01:00:45.959 --> 01:00:47.709
I'd like to hand it over
voluntarily

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:49.041
so you won't think I'm trying
to conceal anything.

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:50.166
Would that be all right?

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:51.917
What kind of weapon, sir?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.375
A hunting knife
right here on my hip.

01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:56.750
I'm on my way to the woods.
My gear's in the trunk.

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:58.583
Would you like me
to hand it to you?

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:01.500
I don't know what the procedure
is for something like this.

01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:02.875
Take the weapon
off your hip,

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.291
place it on the ground,
kick it towards me.

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:08.125
Happy to.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.750
,
What exactly were you
planning on hunting?

01:01:26.834 --> 01:01:28.875
A 50-foot shark.

01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:33.083
You know, I used to be
in law enforcement too.

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:35.083
Is that right?
Uh-huh.

01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:37.291
FBI. Course, that was
some years ago now.

01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:39.959
Psy ops.
Strictly classified.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.083
Are you on any type
of medication,

01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:46.333
or have you been drinking
this afternoon?

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.875
Sir.

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:50.625
I'm sorry.

01:01:50.709 --> 01:01:53.500
I just found myself wondering
what was inside that truck.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.125
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:59.959
to hand me the keys
to your vehicle, please.

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:02.208
( thunder rumbling  )

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:18.458

01:02:18.542 --> 01:02:20.917

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.208

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:04.166
, ,
Fran!
Yeah?

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.333
O'Ryan was here.
Damn it, O'Ryan was here.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.166
He left that
in my jacket.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:11.333
Don't do this again,
Tom. Don't!

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:13.458
Tom! Don't do this!

01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:22.417
( suspenseful theme playing  )

01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:26.959

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:30.917
( film projector running  )

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.375
O'RYAN:
You're gonna help me.

01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:35.709
You're gonna help me
turn it off.

01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:38.208
Nobody told me
how to turn it off.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:39.875
And you're gonna help me
turn it off.

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:41.375
You're here.

01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:42.667
Help me turn it off.

in the world of law enforcement

01:03:48.917 --> 01:03:51.083
are proving
extremely promising.

01:03:51.166 --> 01:03:52.834
The reason you men
are sitting here

01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:56.208
is because you all fit
into the personality profile

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.834

a remote viewer.

Don't close your eyes.

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:21.083
Don't think.

Afraid.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.792
You're becoming emotionally

Look.

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:19.625

You got one of those pins
in Deming yet?

01:11:53.917 --> 01:11:55.875
O'Ryan was spotted there
yesterday.

01:11:55.959 --> 01:11:58.542
Took a squad car and a side arm
off a highway patrolman.

01:11:58.625 --> 01:12:01.375
About an hour later,
a 5-year-old boy was abducted

01:12:01.458 --> 01:12:03.250
roughly a mile
up the interstate.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:05.792
We also found the bodies
of two unidentified females

01:12:05.917 --> 01:12:06.959
in a Dumpster
off the highway.

01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:09.166
Your boy's been busy.

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.542
We're establishing a perimeter
around the city now.

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:14.166
Well, was the patrolman hurt?
What's the difference?

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:15.667
He wasn't, was he?
No, he was fine.

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:16.792
But the girls
in the Dumpster

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.375
had a fatal injury
or two.

01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:21.041
O'Ryan's not the guy.
He's chasing the guy.

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:23.041
Or that patrolman
would be dead.

01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:25.333
Is there any chance I can
ship this guy back to Dallas?

01:12:25.417 --> 01:12:26.917
O'Ryan was FBI, Charleton.

01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:28.041
You ever heard of a project
called Icarus?

01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:29.041
No.

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:30.500
Have you?
No.

01:12:30.583 --> 01:12:31.917
It's agents trained
to see distant locations

01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:33.208
using nothing but the mind.

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:35.041
They call it remote viewing.

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:36.750
Army stole it from the Soviets,
bureau stole it from the Army.

01:12:36.834 --> 01:12:39.750
They use it to track down
serial killers. What?

01:12:39.834 --> 01:12:41.208
You don't believe me,
do you?

01:12:41.291 --> 01:12:42.834
It's bullshit, huh?
It's voodoo?

01:12:42.917 --> 01:12:44.834
Except it worked.
They made a science out of it.

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:46.375
That's how he drew this.

01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:48.083
He'd never been
in this house before.

01:12:48.166 --> 01:12:50.583
He just saw what was in there.
The bureau taught him how.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:52.250
Now he's using it
to track down Suspect Zero.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:53.542
CHARLETON:
You know what, Tom?

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:55.542
I'm extremely tired
of that term.

01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:56.875
Profile the guy.

01:12:56.959 --> 01:12:58.375
He's straight out of Quantico.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.208
He's working a case,
just like we would.

01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:02.041
He's not kidnapping
these little kids.

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:03.375
He's chasing the guy
that's doing the kidnapping.

01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:04.667
Look at the map.

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:11.250
Okay.

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:12.583
What you're telling me
is that all these abductions

01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:14.375
are the work of one guy.

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:16.125
Yes.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.041
Mack,
do you realize

01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:19.458
how insane that is?

01:13:22.959 --> 01:13:26.041
Fran, please help me.
He's not listening to me.

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:29.041
Tom, I'm not sure

01:13:29.125 --> 01:13:31.375
that you're seeing things
very clearly right now.

01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:36.417
CHARLETON: Tom.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.750
Let's just try something
that actually makes sense.

01:13:39.834 --> 01:13:41.709
This guy sends in
these faxes.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:43.417
He picks off three scumbags.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.291
Why? So that we will think
exactly what you're thinking.

01:13:46.375 --> 01:13:47.834
That we got a friend
out there,

01:13:47.917 --> 01:13:50.125
somebody who's willing
to take out the trash

01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:51.792
for the rest of us,
and it's all horseshit!

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.333
And what if it isn't?

01:13:53.417 --> 01:13:55.125
What if there really is
a Suspect Zero out there

01:13:55.208 --> 01:13:57.250
and O'Ryan is the one guy
who's got a shot at him?

01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:58.458
For fuck's sake, Mackelway.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:14:00.750
When did you start
buying into this guy?

01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:07.125
( scoffs  )

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:09.083
Well, he's smarter
than we are.

01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:11.250
CHARLETON:
Speak for yourself.

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:12.834
I'm going to Deming.

01:14:12.917 --> 01:14:14.834
You can take
the rest of the day off.

01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:23.125
( horn honking  )

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:25.917
( indistinct voices on radio  )

01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:30.667
MAN ON RADIO: I'll be damned.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:33.333
( The Wonder Kids Choir's
"Bingo" playing on radio  )

01:14:33.417 --> 01:14:35.500
There was a farmer
Who had a dog ♪

01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:37.792
And Bingo was his name-o ♪

01:14:37.875 --> 01:14:42.625
B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O ♪

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:45.208
( sighs  )

01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:54.625
( sighs  )

01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:16.291
( horn honking  )

01:15:22.917 --> 01:15:24.667
( telephone rings  )
Kulok here.

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:25.917
MACKELWAY: Hey.
Where are you?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.834
I'm headed towards Tucumcari.

01:15:27.917 --> 01:15:29.083
Listen.

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:31.500
Those marks
on the bodies,

01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:33.375
could they be
freezer burns?

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:34.667
Let me get into this.

01:16:00.667 --> 01:16:02.959
( horn honking  )

01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:08.458
( horn honking  )

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:24.291
( horns honking  )

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:26.000
( driver yelling indistinctly  )

01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:57.834
( cell phone ringing  )

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:00.917
MACKELWAY: Yeah?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.333
There's crystallization

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:03.667
because the blood never clotted
in the wounds.

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:05.125
Freezer burn. You're right.

01:17:05.208 --> 01:17:06.917
What, so he keeps the bodies
in a freezer

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.750
and buries them
a thousand miles apart?

01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:10.750
Hey, Tom, what's going on?

01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:12.375
I got a possible suspect.

01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:15.000
( disconnected signal beeping  )

01:17:15.083 --> 01:17:18.041
( performers chanting,
jewelry jangling  )

01:17:28.583 --> 01:17:31.041
( riders screaming  )

01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:38.625
Hey, baby.

01:17:40.417 --> 01:17:42.291
MAN: That kid's been
a brat all morning.

01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:43.709
I could turn
around...

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:47.166
See what you caused?

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:48.458
I gotta go.

01:18:20.792 --> 01:18:23.625
Are you afraid?

01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:27.375
It'd be customary
at this point to start praying.

01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:29.000
I see a lot of that.

01:18:29.083 --> 01:18:32.000
Haven't heard
too many answers, though.

01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:34.125
You're alone.

01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:38.750
Come on!

01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:40.041
Are you afraid?

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:42.792
Where's the boy?
My, my!

01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:44.709
Must be extremely satisfying

01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:47.417
to hear yourself
say something so heroic.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.375
I'm almost envious.

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.125
The boy's in pieces
under the bed.

01:18:52.208 --> 01:18:54.625
Now are you afraid?

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:57.583
I know what you're thinking.

01:18:57.667 --> 01:18:59.083
"Pain is coming.

01:18:59.166 --> 01:19:00.583
Will I take it
like a man?"

01:19:00.667 --> 01:19:01.917
Well, let me
put you at ease.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.458
You won't.
None of them do.

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:05.917
Men, women, children.
They all weep. They all beg.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.291
They pass out.
They piss themselves.

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.875
They attempt negotiation.

01:19:08.959 --> 01:19:10.417
You wouldn't believe
how many men I've seen

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.375
lying right where you're lying
right now.

01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:14.917
Grown men, with wives
and children at home,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.083
offering all kinds
of sexual gratification

01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:18.166
for a five-minute reprieve.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:21.125
It's pathetic.

01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:23.667
Are you afraid?

01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:25.458
Then at that moment
when they realize

01:19:25.542 --> 01:19:27.125
there's nothing left
to negotiate,

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:29.500
they're just mine
and they're helpless,

01:19:29.583 --> 01:19:31.917
the look in their eyes,
the level of surrender,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.959
it's almost pornographic.

01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:37.917
I put that mirror here because
I didn't want you to miss it.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.917
Are you afraid?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.250
Look in the mirror, O'Ryan.

01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:42.959
Are you afraid?
Look in the mirror.

01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:44.792
Are you afraid?
Look in the mirror, O'Ryan.

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.750
Hey, you, fucking Mackelway.

01:19:46.834 --> 01:19:48.458
Look at yourself. Look in
the mirror. Look at yourself.

01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:49.917
Are you afraid, Mackelway?!

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.333
Look at yourself, O'Ryan!
Are you afraid?!

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:54.125
No, I'm not afraid of you.
Open your eyes!

01:19:54.208 --> 01:19:57.166
Open your eyes, goddamn it, or
I'll cut the fucking lids off!

01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:59.875
Then cut
the fucking lids off!

01:20:01.917 --> 01:20:03.959
( panting  )

01:20:08.375 --> 01:20:10.834
O'RYAN:
The initiation
used to be more civil.

01:20:10.917 --> 01:20:13.041
I'm sorry about that.

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.500
You're part of it now.

01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:17.542
There were five of us,
you know.

01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:21.000
The most skilled
technical remote viewers

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:23.208
on Project Icarus.

01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:27.959
You come in in the morning,
have a cup of coffee,

01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:31.458
talk about
the Yankees.

01:20:31.542 --> 01:20:33.875
Then you go to your room with
your pen and your pad of paper,

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:36.125
always alone.

01:20:36.208 --> 01:20:40.500
You try and lock in,
you crank out an ideogram.

01:20:40.583 --> 01:20:43.709
Son of Sam. John Wayne Gacy.
Ted Bundy.

01:20:43.792 --> 01:20:47.166
He might be driving his car,
having a beer,

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:49.208
brushing his teeth,

01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:51.583
cutting someone's eyes out.

01:20:53.792 --> 01:20:55.959
If you did it right,
you got it all.

01:20:57.625 --> 01:20:59.458
The way it sounded,
the way it smelled.

01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:04.041
And those people
were looking right up at you,

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:05.667
begging you for mercy.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:08.834
It was like being God.
But, of course, you're not God.

01:21:08.917 --> 01:21:11.458
Can't do a thing for them.

01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:17.458
They wired us into this current,
the five of us.

01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:21.041
Darkness. The pit itself.

01:21:21.125 --> 01:21:22.959
We were
plugged right into it,

01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:25.667
and no one taught us
how to turn it off.

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:31.792
We saw things
men shouldn't see.

01:21:34.166 --> 01:21:38.041
Agony. Torture.

01:21:38.125 --> 01:21:39.875
Evil.

01:21:39.959 --> 01:21:42.000
It never shut off.

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:45.959
I checked once

01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:48.083
with all the guys that
had been on the project

01:21:48.166 --> 01:21:50.291
when it was just used
for intel.

01:21:50.375 --> 01:21:52.875
You know, finding...

01:21:52.959 --> 01:21:55.041
gun-runners and drug lords,

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:57.041
Soviet missile sites...

01:21:58.291 --> 01:21:59.917
even the Iran hostages.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.625
Anyway...

01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:04.083
I checked with them,
they're all okay.

01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:09.000
But the five of us...

01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:12.166
plugged into the brains and
nervous systems of human beings,

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:15.417
that's when we lost it.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.667
We're all either dead
or institutionalized.

01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:23.500
After a while,

01:22:23.583 --> 01:22:26.542
those conversations about
the Yankees became impossible.

01:22:46.959 --> 01:22:48.375
( engine cuts off  )

01:23:01.041 --> 01:23:03.542
( mysterious theme playing  )

01:24:33.834 --> 01:24:36.333
( voices whispering eerily  )

01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:02.458
,
MACKELWAY: O'Ryan.

01:25:02.542 --> 01:25:05.667
Those faxes...

01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:08.166
the missings...

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:10.542
how many of them are his?

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:17.041
O'RYAN: All of them.

01:25:22.875 --> 01:25:25.625
You were the missing piece,
Mack.

01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:27.709
Now everything's in place.

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:31.875
All you have to do
is finish it.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:14.166
, ,
( air brakes hiss  )

01:26:23.959 --> 01:26:25.041
( starts engine  )

01:26:25.125 --> 01:26:27.834
( tires squealing  )

01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:34.750
( dialing  )

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:37.834
This is Mackelway.

01:26:37.917 --> 01:26:39.917
I'm traveling north,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.500
approaching I-54 in Tucumcari.
Request immediate backup.

01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:45.417
I'm pursuing a possible suspect
in a refrigerated truck.

01:27:19.792 --> 01:27:21.542
Brake!

01:27:50.041 --> 01:27:53.041
( grunting  )

01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:18.875
, ,
KULOK: Hey, Tom!

01:28:18.959 --> 01:28:20.542
Tom!

01:28:20.625 --> 01:28:23.041
Get the trailer open!
There's a kid in the trailer!

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:47.166
Hi. Hey.

01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:49.208
Hey, buddy.

01:28:49.291 --> 01:28:51.041
You okay?

01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:54.500
I got you, okay?

01:28:54.583 --> 01:28:55.917
Okay, come here. Oh.

01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:58.792
I got you.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:14.083
( police sirens approaching  )

01:29:14.166 --> 01:29:15.917
Get an ambulance.
Yes, ma'am.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.166
( officers speak indistinctly  )

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:21.959
( suspenseful theme playing  )

01:29:43.667 --> 01:29:45.583
, ,
( both grunting  )

01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:48.667
( Mackelway groaning  )

01:30:12.834 --> 01:30:15.208
, ,
( grunting  )

01:30:16.166 --> 01:30:19.208
( yelling  )

01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:21.291
( panting heavily  )

01:30:27.083 --> 01:30:28.291
WOMAN: I won't tell!

01:30:28.375 --> 01:30:30.959
( overlapping voices echoing  )

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:33.166
( panting  )

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:39.583
I knew I was right about you.

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:42.667
No. No, that wasn't me.

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:43.917
Of course it was you.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.625
It wasn't me.

01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:46.959
It wasn't
the wind.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.291
You beat him to death.

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:50.500
Now all you have to do
is finish it.

01:30:50.583 --> 01:30:52.458
Finish it!

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:54.417
You have to understand,
none of this was arbitrary.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:55.500
We were chosen, you and I.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:57.458
It's not a bad start, Mack!

01:30:57.542 --> 01:31:00.125
We made the world
a little safer. We made justice.

01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:02.125
No, this wasn't justice.
Of course it was!

01:31:02.208 --> 01:31:04.625
And so is this.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.667
No. I'm not gonna
kill you, O'Ryan.

01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:08.458
You already have.

01:31:08.542 --> 01:31:10.000
I've seen it
a thousand times.

01:31:10.083 --> 01:31:12.041
No, you saw wrong.
That's impossible!

01:31:12.125 --> 01:31:14.542
I saw us here.
I saw all of it.

01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:16.333
Me baiting you,
testing you.

01:31:16.417 --> 01:31:17.667
Look at him!

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:18.959
You've arrived.
You're cursed.

01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:21.875
Like me. Only you keep
running from it.

01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:25.333
You hear things.

01:31:25.417 --> 01:31:27.959
You see things.
That's why you can't sleep.

01:31:28.041 --> 01:31:30.166
Why your head always aches.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:31.542
Get up.

01:31:32.792 --> 01:31:34.750
Get up!

01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:40.750
There is no Zero.

01:31:42.417 --> 01:31:45.375
You're a confused old man.
Can't you see that?

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.709
You think we did
something mythical here today?

01:31:47.792 --> 01:31:49.709
You think we put an end to evil
or something?

01:31:49.792 --> 01:31:51.250
We killed a deviant, that's all.

01:31:51.333 --> 01:31:53.542
There are thousands of them
out there.

01:31:53.625 --> 01:31:56.041
O'Ryan, you're a guy
with a skill.

01:31:56.125 --> 01:31:58.709
You're not God.
You can't see everything.

01:31:58.792 --> 01:32:01.083
You don't decide
what's justice.

01:32:01.166 --> 01:32:02.792
KULOK: Freeze!

01:32:17.333 --> 01:32:20.875
Please, Mack.
I can't sleep anymore.

01:32:20.959 --> 01:32:23.709
I keep seeing
all those faces.

01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:26.166
The ones I couldn't save.

01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:29.041
All those missings.

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:30.875
You know, they never blink.

01:32:32.834 --> 01:32:35.291
And they're all in here.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.458
I want you to
shut it off for me.

01:32:39.542 --> 01:32:41.083
Please, Mack,
I'm so tired.

01:32:41.166 --> 01:32:43.083
I just want you
to shut it off for me!

01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:45.166
Shut it off for me.

01:32:48.333 --> 01:32:49.625
I can't.

01:32:52.291 --> 01:32:54.875
I'm not you.

01:32:54.959 --> 01:32:56.333
( scoffs  )

01:32:59.166 --> 01:33:00.208
Yet!

01:33:00.291 --> 01:33:02.125
( cocks gun  )

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:03.667
( gunshot  )

01:33:06.333 --> 01:33:10.208
( mystical theme playing  )

01:33:16.667 --> 01:33:19.125
So tired.

01:33:19.208 --> 01:33:21.041
So tired.

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.333
Thank you.

01:33:27.834 --> 01:33:29.458
( mystical theme
continues playing  )

01:33:29.542 --> 01:33:32.166
( wind whistling  )

01:33:53.583 --> 01:33:56.291
( mystical theme
continues playing  )

01:33:56.375 --> 01:33:58.750
( wind continues whistling  )

01:34:17.709 --> 01:34:19.542
( mystical theme fades  )

01:34:24.375 --> 01:34:26.875
( mysterious theme playing  )
