WEBVTT

00:07.006 --> 00:07.025
 Lemonis:

00:07.011 --> 00:07.025
TONIGHT ON "THE PROFIT"...

00:09.025 --> 00:10.026
			IT'S A SMALL SPACE.

00:10.028 --> 00:12.003
		Tonnie: IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING.

00:12.003 --> 00:14.028
	Lemonis: ...A TINY CUPCAKE SHOP

00:12.003 --> 00:14.028
	WITH A BIG IDEA.

00:14.028 --> 00:16.018
			Tonnie: YOU WALK IN,

00:14.028 --> 00:16.018
YOU PICK YOUR CUPCAKE OUT,

00:16.021 --> 00:18.001
	YOU PICK YOUR TOPPINGS.

00:18.001 --> 00:20.007
	Lemonis: TONNIE'S MINIS

00:18.001 --> 00:20.007
		SHOULD BE RAKING IN THE DOUGH,

00:20.007 --> 00:21.010
		BUT IT'S NOT.

00:21.010 --> 00:24.013
	THERE'S $134,000 WORTH OF DEBT.

00:24.013 --> 00:27.000
			HIS BIGGEST INVESTOR

00:24.013 --> 00:27.000
			IS HIS WIFE.

00:27.001 --> 00:29.012
Erenisse: IT'S TO THE POINT THAT

00:27.001 --> 00:29.012
	I'M NOT GIVING ANY MORE MONEY.

00:29.013 --> 00:32.000
	Lemonis: TONNIE'S BAKERY

00:29.013 --> 00:32.000
	IS CRAMPED AND CHAOTIC.

00:32.002 --> 00:33.018
	SALES ARE DOWN.

00:33.018 --> 00:35.005
RIGHT NOW,

00:33.018 --> 00:35.005
		WE'RE LOSING MONEY EVERY DAY,

00:35.006 --> 00:36.021
AND SO I'M TRYING

00:35.006 --> 00:36.021
		TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

00:36.023 --> 00:38.020
AND THE DEBT KEEPS RISING.

00:38.021 --> 00:42.000
Erenisse: I'M JUST UPSET,

00:38.021 --> 00:42.000
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

00:42.000 --> 00:44.011
	ALL THOSE PEOPLE

00:42.000 --> 00:44.011
		THAT WE OWE MONEY TO.

00:44.012 --> 00:47.012
	Lemonis: IF I CAN'T FIND

00:44.012 --> 00:47.012
		A WINNING RECIPE FOR TONNIE...

00:47.014 --> 00:48.029
	WE'RE CLOSING THE STORE.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.009
			Lauren: OH, MY GOD.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.009
		THIS IS AMA--

00:51.011 --> 00:52.012
[ GLASS SHATTERS ]

00:52.014 --> 00:54.006
			Lemonis: ...HIS RELATIONSHIP

00:54.006 --> 00:56.000
		AND HIS BUSINESS WILL CRUMBLE.

00:56.002 --> 00:58.003
	YOU DON'T ALWAYS

00:56.002 --> 00:58.003
		THINK THINGS THROUGH.

00:58.003 --> 01:00.009
	-Tonnie: REALLY?

00:58.003 --> 01:00.009
	-Lemonis: YEAH, REALLY.

01:06.001 --> 01:07.022
			Tonnie: WELCOME TO TONNIE'S.

01:06.001 --> 01:07.022
	FIRST TIME HERE?

01:07.024 --> 01:09.001
			Woman: YEAH.

01:09.003 --> 01:11.010
		Lemonis: TONNIE ROSIER

01:09.003 --> 01:11.010
HAS ALWAYS LOVED TO BAKE,

01:11.012 --> 01:13.016
	AND HE LEARNED THE CRAFT

01:11.012 --> 01:13.016
	FROM HIS MOTHER.

01:13.018 --> 01:17.012
			IN 2006, HE OPENED HIS FIRST

01:13.018 --> 01:17.012
	BAKERY IN NEW YORK CITY,

01:17.013 --> 01:20.007
	AND HE WAS ABLE TO LAND

01:17.013 --> 01:20.007
			BIG ACCOUNTS

01:20.007 --> 01:22.025
WITH RETAILERS LIKE MACY'S

01:20.007 --> 01:22.025
			AND BLOOMINGDALE'S.

01:22.027 --> 01:25.022
BUT HIS BUSINESS SKILLS --

01:22.027 --> 01:25.022
			WELL, THEY WERE HALF-BAKED.

01:25.024 --> 01:28.015
Tonnie: I'M A LITTLE LOST

01:25.024 --> 01:28.015
	AS TO A NOTICE OF CANCELLATION.

01:28.016 --> 01:30.001
		Tamika: DIDN'T I JUST PAY THAT

01:28.016 --> 01:30.001
YESTERDAY?

01:30.001 --> 01:32.021
		Lemonis: TONNIE WAS CONSTANTLY

01:30.001 --> 01:32.021
		BORROWING MONEY FROM HIS WIFE

01:32.021 --> 01:34.020
TO COVER RENT AND PAYROLL.

01:34.021 --> 01:35.028
Erenisse: WHAT'S THE PLAN

01:36.000 --> 01:38.026
			TO RECOUP THE MONEY

01:36.000 --> 01:38.026
	AND AT LEAST BREAK EVEN?

01:38.027 --> 01:41.002
Lemonis: HE'S ALREADY BEEN

01:38.027 --> 01:41.002
	FORCED TO SHUT DOWN TWO STORES.

01:41.003 --> 01:44.020
	AND HIS CURRENT SHOP?

01:41.003 --> 01:44.020
WELL, IT'S ALREADY LOSING MONEY.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.021
	Tonnie:

01:44.021 --> 01:46.021
			WE ARE AT A BREAKING POINT.

01:46.022 --> 01:49.004
			Lemonis: THE GOURMET CUPCAKE

01:46.022 --> 01:49.004
			BUSINESS IS STILL THRIVING,

01:49.006 --> 01:51.000
AND IT'S A BUSINESS I KNOW WELL.

01:51.001 --> 01:54.000
	AND WHILE FIXING TONNIE'S MINIS

01:51.001 --> 01:54.000
			WON'T BE A CAKEWALK,

01:54.001 --> 01:56.012
	HE'S GOT AN IDEA

01:54.001 --> 01:56.012
		THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE --

01:56.013 --> 01:58.014
A BUILD-YOUR-OWN CUPCAKE.

02:00.016 --> 02:03.013
		INWOOD IS AT THE NORTHERN TIP

02:00.016 --> 02:03.013
		OF MANHATTAN.

02:03.015 --> 02:05.015
		IT'S AN UP-AND-COMING

02:03.015 --> 02:05.015
			NEIGHBORHOOD

02:05.016 --> 02:06.027
WITH A LOT OF RENOVATION,

02:06.028 --> 02:09.007
			AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:06.028 --> 02:09.007
	NEW RESTAURANTS AND NEW RETAIL,

02:09.008 --> 02:11.019
AND YOU FEEL LIKE

02:09.008 --> 02:11.019
			IT'S REALLY GROWING.

02:14.002 --> 02:18.013
BUT TONNIE'S MINIS HAS THE WORST

02:14.002 --> 02:18.013
RETAIL ENTRANCE I'VE EVER SEEN.

02:18.014 --> 02:20.019
			I MEAN, THERE'S SCAFFOLDING

02:18.014 --> 02:20.019
			EVERYWHERE.

02:20.020 --> 02:22.015
THE PLACES

02:20.020 --> 02:22.015
		ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM

02:22.016 --> 02:24.008
LOOK LIKE

02:22.016 --> 02:24.008
			THEY'RE IN REALLY BAD SHAPE.

02:24.009 --> 02:26.024
			THIS BUILD-YOUR-OWN CUPCAKE

02:24.009 --> 02:26.024
	BETTER BE GREAT.

02:26.025 --> 02:28.020
		-HOW YOU DOING?

02:26.025 --> 02:28.020
		-Tonnie: HOW ARE YOU?

02:28.021 --> 02:29.021
	Lemonis: ARE YOU TONNIE?

02:29.022 --> 02:30.022
		-Tonnie: I AM.

02:29.022 --> 02:30.022
		-Lemonis: I'M MARCUS.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.026
	Tonnie:

02:30.024 --> 02:31.026
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, SIR.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.021
Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.003
			IT'S A SMALL SPACE.

02:34.004 --> 02:35.028
	Tonnie:

02:34.004 --> 02:35.028
			YES, IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.026
		Lemonis: I'M EXPECTING TO FIND

02:37.026 --> 02:40.003
		A BRIGHT, FUN

02:37.026 --> 02:40.003
			RETAIL ENVIRONMENT.

02:40.004 --> 02:43.001
	AND WHAT I END UP SEEING

02:40.004 --> 02:43.001
		IS NO DISPLAY

02:43.002 --> 02:46.003
AND A BUNCH OF PACKAGED CUPCAKES

02:43.002 --> 02:46.003
			THAT ARE MADE IN THE BACK.

02:46.004 --> 02:48.006
		IT'S CROWDED.

02:46.004 --> 02:48.006
IT'S NOT INVITING.

02:48.007 --> 02:50.014
	I MEAN,

02:48.007 --> 02:50.014
			WHO WOULD WANT TO COME HERE?

02:50.014 --> 02:52.014
		-Tonnie: HOW ARE YOU?

02:50.014 --> 02:52.014
		-Woman: GOOD.

02:52.015 --> 02:54.009
			Tonnie: WELCOME TO TONNIE'S.

02:52.015 --> 02:54.009
			WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY?

02:54.010 --> 02:55.020
Woman: LET ME GET

02:54.010 --> 02:55.020
THE CREAM CHEESE.

02:55.021 --> 02:57.003
	Tonnie: CAN I OFFER YOU

02:55.021 --> 02:57.003
A CUPCAKE, MARCUS,

02:57.004 --> 02:58.009
AT THE SAME TIME?

02:58.009 --> 03:00.010
Lemonis: YOU SURPRISE ME.

02:58.009 --> 03:00.010
			SO, THAT'S THE BASE?

03:00.012 --> 03:01.020
		Tonnie: TRADITIONALLY,

03:00.012 --> 03:01.020
		YOU WALK IN --

03:01.020 --> 03:04.016
		MARCUS, YOU HAVE MY --

03:01.020 --> 03:04.016
			ANOTHER GUY NAMED MARCUS --

03:04.018 --> 03:06.007
		MARCUS, YOU HAVE MY SteriBag?

03:06.008 --> 03:07.020
	Marcus: NO, IT SHOULD BE

03:06.008 --> 03:07.020
		IN THE FRONT.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.021
			Tonnie: NEVER MIND.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.021
I GOT IT.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.021
		SO, THE BEAUTY

03:08.021 --> 03:10.021
			OF TONNIE'S MINIS IS

03:10.022 --> 03:12.021
			YOU WALK IN,

03:10.022 --> 03:12.021
YOU PICK YOUR CUPCAKE OUT,

03:12.021 --> 03:13.024
		YOU PICK YOUR TOPPING.

03:13.025 --> 03:15.000
Woman: I LIKE IT.

03:15.001 --> 03:15.026
	IT MEANS MAKE YOUR OWN CUPCAKE,

03:15.001 --> 03:15.026
			ESSENTIALLY.

03:15.026 --> 03:17.003
		Lemonis: YOU A CUPCAKE EATER?

03:17.004 --> 03:19.018
		Woman: YES, ACTUALLY.

03:17.004 --> 03:19.018
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:19.019 --> 03:21.002
	-HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY.

03:19.019 --> 03:21.002
	-Tonnie: TAKE CARE.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
	Lemonis: CUPCAKE'S GOOD.

03:23.001 --> 03:23.026
	Tonnie:

03:23.001 --> 03:23.026
ALWAYS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

03:23.027 --> 03:25.002
		Lemonis: THE FROSTING'S GOOD.

03:25.002 --> 03:27.018
THE PROCESS SEEMED

03:25.002 --> 03:27.018
	A LITTLE...NONEXISTENT.

03:27.019 --> 03:28.026
			I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

03:28.026 --> 03:31.001
		THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

03:28.026 --> 03:31.001
A BIT OF AN ASSEMBLY LINE,

03:31.002 --> 03:33.006
		LIKE BASE, FROSTING, TOPPING.

03:33.007 --> 03:35.010
		I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT.

03:35.012 --> 03:37.019
		TONNIE'S IDEA

03:35.012 --> 03:37.019
			OF A BUILD-YOUR-OWN CUPCAKE,

03:37.020 --> 03:39.015
		QUITE FRANKLY, IS PHENOMENAL.

03:39.016 --> 03:42.014
			BUT THE IDEA I THOUGHT I WAS

03:39.016 --> 03:42.014
			COMING FOR I JUST DON'T SEE.

03:42.015 --> 03:44.016
SOMEBODY TAKES A CAKE OFF A RACK

03:44.018 --> 03:46.025
AND THEN THE TOPPINGS ARE,

03:44.018 --> 03:46.025
	LIKE, HIDDEN UNDER THE COUNTER.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.002
		I MEAN, IT'S TERRIBLE.

03:48.002 --> 03:50.022
HOW MUCH BUSINESS

03:48.002 --> 03:50.022
	ARE YOU DOING IN THIS LOCATION?

03:50.024 --> 03:52.001
		Tonnie: AVERAGE IS $500 A DAY.

03:52.002 --> 03:54.009
		Lemonis: AND WHAT ARE

03:52.002 --> 03:54.009
YOUR MARGINS ON THAT $500?

03:54.010 --> 03:55.009
		Tonnie: UM...

03:55.009 --> 03:57.020
	CUPCAKE COSTS ME

03:55.009 --> 03:57.020
A QUARTER TO MAKE.

03:57.021 --> 03:59.021
			Lemonis: WRAPPER, FROSTING,

03:57.021 --> 03:59.021
LABOR, EVERYTHING?

03:59.021 --> 04:01.003
			Tonnie: SO IT, UH...

04:01.004 --> 04:03.016
	Lemonis: ONE CUPCAKE --

04:01.004 --> 04:03.016
			WHAT DOES THAT COST TO MAKE?

04:03.018 --> 04:06.009
	Tonnie:

04:03.018 --> 04:06.009
			SO, THE COST OF THE CUPCAKE

04:06.009 --> 04:09.009
		WOULD BE CLOSER TO...33 CENTS.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.019
		-Lemonis: ARE YOU WINGING IT?

04:09.010 --> 04:11.019
		-Tonnie: I'M ESTIMATING.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.002
	Lemonis:

04:11.020 --> 04:13.002
		I WOULDN'T CALL IT ESTIMATING.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.004
I'M GONNA CALL IT GUESSTIMATING.

04:14.006 --> 04:15.027
	Tonnie: TOUCHÃ©.

04:15.028 --> 04:17.016
	Lemonis:

04:15.028 --> 04:17.016
		WHAT ARE YOU SELLING THEM FOR?

04:17.017 --> 04:19.009
Tonnie: STARTING AT $2.25.

04:19.011 --> 04:22.004
Lemonis: OKAY. IF YOU'RE SELLING

04:19.011 --> 04:22.004
			$500 A DAY WORTH,

04:22.004 --> 04:25.014
	AND YOU AND I DO A DEAL

04:22.004 --> 04:25.014
	AND WE SELL $5,000 A DAY WORTH,

04:25.016 --> 04:27.019
			I STILL WANT TO KNOW

04:25.016 --> 04:27.019
WHAT IT COSTS TO MAKE ONE.

04:27.019 --> 04:31.007
			IF IT COSTS TONNIE 33 CENTS

04:27.019 --> 04:31.007
TO MAKE A CUPCAKE

04:31.009 --> 04:35.004
AND HE SELLS IT FOR $2.25,

04:31.009 --> 04:35.004
		HE'S GOT GREAT MARGIN.

04:35.005 --> 04:38.023
		THE WORRY HERE IS THAT

04:35.005 --> 04:38.023
HE'S SHAKY ON HIS NUMBERS,

04:38.024 --> 04:42.023
			AND AT $500 A DAY IN SALES,

04:38.024 --> 04:42.023
			THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ERROR.

04:42.024 --> 04:44.024
		KIND OF A TIGHT SPACE.

04:44.026 --> 04:46.028
Tonnie: THIS IS THE OVEN.

04:46.028 --> 04:48.014
	Lemonis: THIS IS

04:46.028 --> 04:48.014
	THE ONLY OVEN YOU HAVE?

04:48.016 --> 04:49.023
	Tonnie: THIS IS

04:48.016 --> 04:49.023
			THE ONLY OVEN I HAVE, YEAH.

04:49.024 --> 04:51.021
		Lemonis: THERE IS NO WORKFLOW

04:49.024 --> 04:51.021
		IN THIS PLACE,

04:51.023 --> 04:54.023
	AND IT'S CRAMPED

04:51.023 --> 04:54.023
AND IT'S HARD TO MANEUVER,

04:54.024 --> 04:57.009
			AND THEIR INGREDIENTS ARE

04:54.024 --> 04:57.009
JUST STORED RANDOMLY EVERYWHERE.

04:57.011 --> 04:59.014
		I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'VE BEEN

04:57.011 --> 04:59.014
ABLE TO BAKE HERE.

04:59.016 --> 05:01.017
			Tamika: HI, MARCUS. TAMIKA.

05:01.019 --> 05:02.028
	Lemonis:

05:01.019 --> 05:02.028
TAMIKA, NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.004
	Tamika: YOU TOO.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.005
		Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

05:04.004 --> 05:05.005
			ARE YOU THE SISTER?

05:05.007 --> 05:06.017
			Tamika: YES.

05:06.019 --> 05:07.021
			Lemonis: I'D LOVE TO KIND OF

05:06.019 --> 05:07.021
			SPEND A FEW MINUTES WITH YOU

05:07.021 --> 05:08.012
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.024
		Tamika: OKAY.

05:09.026 --> 05:12.011
Lemonis: WHO'S THE MANAGER HERE?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.018
Tamika: I'M ON AGAIN, OFF AGAIN.

05:14.019 --> 05:15.028
		Lemonis: WALK ME THROUGH THAT.

05:15.028 --> 05:18.018
		Tamika: I WORKED FOR,

05:15.028 --> 05:18.018
		LIKE, REALLY, REALLY LOW PAY,

05:18.019 --> 05:19.026
	WHICH WAS OKAY WITH ME.

05:19.028 --> 05:21.002
		Lemonis: FOR HOW LONG?

05:21.004 --> 05:23.005
		-Tamika: LIKE A YEAR.

05:21.004 --> 05:23.005
		-Lemonis: WOW.

05:23.007 --> 05:25.028
		TONNIE'S BASICALLY RELYING ON

05:23.007 --> 05:25.028
			FREE LABOR.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.019
			AND THE FACT THAT HIS SISTER

05:26.000 --> 05:28.019
		IS WILLING TO HELP OUT

05:28.021 --> 05:31.005
		SHOWS THAT HE HAS REAL BACKING

05:28.021 --> 05:31.005
	FROM HIS FAMILY.

05:31.007 --> 05:33.007
		THAT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE

05:31.007 --> 05:33.007
	WHEN YOU'RE STRUGGLING.

05:33.007 --> 05:36.012
			SO, WHO'S DOING THE QUALITY

05:33.007 --> 05:36.012
		CONTROL ON THIS KIND OF STUFF?

05:36.014 --> 05:38.007
			-Tamika: MYSELF AND TONNIE.

05:36.014 --> 05:38.007
			-Lemonis: YOURSELF?

05:38.009 --> 05:39.024
			AND SO DO YOU THINK

05:38.009 --> 05:39.024
THIS LOOKS RIGHT?

05:39.026 --> 05:41.011
	Tamika:

05:39.026 --> 05:41.011
		NO, THAT ONE'S NOT GOING OUT.

05:41.012 --> 05:42.019
	Lemonis:

05:41.012 --> 05:42.019
I DON'T WANT TO SEE PAPER.

05:42.021 --> 05:43.026
			THIS WOULDN'T CLEAR.

05:43.028 --> 05:45.024
	Tamika:

05:43.028 --> 05:45.024
			AND THE MORE WE GO THROUGH,

05:45.024 --> 05:47.009
		WE REALIZE HOW MUCH IS WASTED.

05:47.009 --> 05:48.024
			Lemonis: WHEN THIS HAPPENS,

05:48.024 --> 05:51.004
	TWO FROM THE SAME BATCH

05:48.024 --> 05:51.004
AT THE SAME TIME,

05:51.004 --> 05:52.021
			THERE'S NO PROCESS.

05:52.023 --> 05:54.028
			Tamika: AND LET ME TELL YOU,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.021
		I HAVE FOUGHT WITH MY BROTHER

05:55.000 --> 05:58.021
	ON THIS PROCESS.

05:58.023 --> 05:59.026
	Lemonis:

05:58.023 --> 05:59.026
		WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING WITH HIM?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.028
		WHY AREN'T YOU JUST FIXING IT?

06:00.028 --> 06:03.002
	-DOES HE LISTEN TO YOU?

06:00.028 --> 06:03.002
	-Tamika: NO.

06:03.002 --> 06:04.017
		-Lemonis: NO?

06:03.002 --> 06:04.017
			-Tamika: NO.

06:05.017 --> 06:06.024
Lemonis: THAT LOOKS NICE.

06:06.024 --> 06:08.005
	ARE YOU

06:06.024 --> 06:08.005
		A PROFESSIONAL CAKE DECORATOR?

06:08.007 --> 06:09.014
			Marcus: YEAH, I AM.

06:09.014 --> 06:11.026
	Lemonis:

06:09.014 --> 06:11.026
	IT'S A SMALL SPACE TO WORK, NO?

06:11.026 --> 06:13.026
		AND IS TONNIE

06:11.026 --> 06:13.026
EASY TO WORK WITH?

06:13.026 --> 06:15.000
		Marcus: YEAH.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.009
			Lemonis: AND HOW ABOUT HER?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.009
			IS SHE MEAN?

06:16.011 --> 06:17.019
	Marcus:

06:16.011 --> 06:17.019
[ Laughing ] NO, SHE'S --

06:17.019 --> 06:18.024
Tamika: [ LAUGHS ]

06:18.026 --> 06:20.028
	Woman: HI. HOW ARE YOU?

06:20.028 --> 06:22.028
			Lauren: WHAT KIND OF CUPCAKE

06:20.028 --> 06:22.028
	WOULD YOU LIKE?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
	Girl: STRAWBERRY TWIST.

06:24.002 --> 06:25.016
	Lauren:

06:24.002 --> 06:25.016
			YOU WANT A STRAWBERRY TWIST?

06:25.016 --> 06:28.011
		ALL RIGHT, SO,

06:25.016 --> 06:28.011
			YOUR TOTAL'S GONNA BE $7.50.

06:28.012 --> 06:30.009
	Lemonis: HOW MANY STAFF MEMBERS

06:28.012 --> 06:30.009
			DO YOU HAVE?

06:30.009 --> 06:32.018
Tonnie: 12. LAUREN WILL BE

06:30.009 --> 06:32.018
	THE ONE WHO'LL BE IN THE FRONT.

06:32.019 --> 06:33.026
		-Lemonis: HI. ARE YOU -- HI.

06:32.019 --> 06:33.026
		-Lauren: I'M LAUREN.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.009
			Lemonis: HI, LAUREN.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.009
			HOW ARE YOU?

06:35.011 --> 06:37.000
-Lauren: GOOD. NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:35.011 --> 06:37.000
-Lemonis: VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:37.002 --> 06:38.026
			-ARE YOU A BAKER?

06:37.002 --> 06:38.026
			-Lauren: WHEN I HAVE TO BE.

06:38.026 --> 06:40.019
			Lemonis: SO WHAT IS

06:38.026 --> 06:40.019
	YOUR PRIMARY ROLE HERE?

06:40.019 --> 06:42.021
	Lauren: I'M IN THE FRONT

06:40.019 --> 06:42.021
			SELLING THE PRODUCT.

06:42.021 --> 06:43.018
		Lemonis: OKAY, GREAT.

06:42.021 --> 06:43.018
NICE MEETING YOU.

06:43.019 --> 06:45.012
			Lauren: YOU TOO. THANK YOU.

06:45.012 --> 06:46.014
		Tonnie: THERE'S A LOT GOING ON

06:45.012 --> 06:46.014
			WITH TONNIE'S MINIS

06:46.014 --> 06:47.026
		RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK.

06:47.028 --> 06:51.007
	I'M DOING A PROJECT IN NEWARK

06:47.028 --> 06:51.007
THAT'S CLOSE TO BEING FINALIZED.

06:51.007 --> 06:54.021
THE PEOPLE

06:51.007 --> 06:54.021
			WHO ARE GIVING ME THE SPACE,

06:54.021 --> 06:56.002
	THEY'RE BUILDING OUT THE STORE.

06:56.002 --> 06:57.007
Lemonis: AT THEIR EXPENSE?

06:57.007 --> 06:58.011
Tonnie: AT THEIR EXPENSE.

06:58.012 --> 07:00.019
	SO WHAT I HAVE TO SUPPLY

06:58.012 --> 07:00.019
		IS EQUIPMENT,

07:00.019 --> 07:03.005
THE FIRST MONTH'S DEPOSIT,

07:00.019 --> 07:03.005
	WORKING CAPITAL.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.028
	Lemonis: AND THEY'RE GIVING YOU

07:03.007 --> 07:04.028
		THE MONEY TO DO THAT?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.021
Tonnie: THEY'RE			 LOANING			 ME

07:05.000 --> 07:07.021
		THE MONEY TO DO THAT.

07:07.021 --> 07:10.019
			Lemonis: DO YOU FEEL LIKE

07:07.021 --> 07:10.019
YOU'RE READY FOR MORE EXPANSION?

07:10.019 --> 07:11.026
Tonnie: I AM NOW.

07:11.026 --> 07:14.004
	Lemonis: THE ONLY TIME

07:11.026 --> 07:14.004
	A BUSINESS SHOULD BE EXPANDING

07:14.004 --> 07:16.000
	IS WHEN IT'S TOTALLY PROVEN OUT

07:14.004 --> 07:16.000
ITS MODEL.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.012
			YOU HAVE THE PRODUCT RIGHT,

07:16.002 --> 07:18.012
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE,

07:18.012 --> 07:20.016
			YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PROCESS,

07:18.012 --> 07:20.016
			AND IT MAKES MONEY.

07:20.016 --> 07:22.002
		SO GOOD-IDEA PEOPLE ARE GOOD,

07:22.004 --> 07:24.026
			BUT GOOD-IDEA PEOPLE

07:22.004 --> 07:24.026
		THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXECUTE

07:24.028 --> 07:26.024
CAN BE VERY LETHAL

07:24.028 --> 07:26.024
		TO A BUSINESS.

07:26.026 --> 07:28.005
			HI.

07:28.007 --> 07:29.014
Erenisse: HI. HOW ARE YOU?

07:29.014 --> 07:31.002
			-Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

07:29.014 --> 07:31.002
			-Erenisse: : I'M ERENISSE.

07:31.002 --> 07:32.016
-Lemonis: ARE YOU TONNIE'S WIFE?

07:31.002 --> 07:32.016
-Erenisse: YES, I AM.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.007
-Lemonis: HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.007
-Erenisse: NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:34.009 --> 07:36.000
		Lemonis: YOU WANT HELP

07:34.009 --> 07:36.000
		TAKING YOUR COAT OFF?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.009
			Erenisse: THANK YOU.

07:37.009 --> 07:38.016
		-Lemonis: YOU GOT IT.

07:37.009 --> 07:38.016
		-Erenisse: WHAT A GENTLEMAN.

07:38.018 --> 07:40.011
		Lemonis: SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK

07:38.018 --> 07:40.011
		OF THE STORE?

07:40.012 --> 07:42.021
Erenisse:

07:40.012 --> 07:42.021
			I THINK IT NEEDS AN UPGRADE.

07:42.023 --> 07:43.023
	THAT'S WHY I WROTE YOU.

07:43.024 --> 07:44.023
Lemonis: OH, OKAY.

07:44.024 --> 07:46.007
		TONNIE, I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.019
		Tonnie: NO, IT WAS --

07:46.007 --> 07:48.019
		IT WAS -- IT WAS HER.

07:48.021 --> 07:50.024
Erenisse:

07:48.021 --> 07:50.024
THE BUSINESS ASPECT OF IT

07:50.024 --> 07:53.007
HAS PLACED A LOT OF STRESS

07:50.024 --> 07:53.007
	ON OUR MARRIAGE.

07:53.009 --> 07:56.026
		IT'S TO THE POINT THAT

07:53.009 --> 07:56.026
		I'M NOT GIVING ANY MORE MONEY.

07:56.028 --> 07:59.004
		Lemonis: HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU

07:56.028 --> 07:59.004
	HAVE INVESTED IN THIS BUSINESS?

07:59.004 --> 08:00.026
	Erenisse: LIKE $250,000.

08:00.028 --> 08:04.026
Lemonis: $250,000

08:04.028 --> 08:07.017
	IS WHAT ERENISSE HAS PUT

08:04.028 --> 08:07.017
			INTO THAT BUSINESS.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.005
			THAT MONEY IS GONE.

08:09.007 --> 08:13.002
Erenisse: ALTOGETHER, WE'VE BEEN

08:09.007 --> 08:13.002
		TOGETHER OVER 10 YEARS NOW,

08:13.002 --> 08:14.016
		SO DIFFERENT THINGS --

08:14.018 --> 08:19.007
		HELPED WITH THE RENT,

08:14.018 --> 08:19.007
		HELPED WITH MATERIALS.

08:19.009 --> 08:21.016
		Lemonis: DID YOU WIN THE LOTTO

08:19.009 --> 08:21.016
		OR SOMETHING?

08:21.018 --> 08:23.021
		Erenisse: NO,

08:21.018 --> 08:23.021
I'M TRYING TO SUPPORT HIM,

08:23.021 --> 08:27.012
			YOU KNOW, UNTIL THE BUSINESS

08:23.021 --> 08:27.012
		CAN TAKE OFF.

08:27.012 --> 08:28.026
		Lemonis: OKAY.

08:28.026 --> 08:31.024
Erenisse: I THINK HE NEEDS YOU.

08:28.026 --> 08:31.024
I THINK HE NEEDS YOUR EXPERTISE.

08:31.026 --> 08:33.020
	IF HE HEARS IT FROM YOU,

08:31.026 --> 08:33.020
			MAYBE HE'LL TAKE IT.

08:33.022 --> 08:34.028
	Lemonis:

08:33.022 --> 08:34.028
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO YOU?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.024
			Erenisse: NOT ALL THE TIME.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.024
NOT QUITE.

08:36.025 --> 08:38.020
		Lemonis: TONNIE DOESN'T LISTEN

08:36.025 --> 08:38.020
			TO HIS WIFE,

08:38.022 --> 08:39.028
		WHO'S INVESTED A TON OF MONEY.

08:39.028 --> 08:41.010
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO HIS SISTER,

08:41.013 --> 08:43.004
	WHO WORKS THERE

08:41.013 --> 08:43.004
			VIRTUALLY FOR FREE.

08:43.004 --> 08:45.014
		HOW DO I KNOW

08:43.004 --> 08:45.014
	HE'S GONNA LISTEN TO ME?

08:46.010 --> 08:49.025
			SO, CUPCAKE TASTES GREAT,

08:46.010 --> 08:49.025
BUT THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW

08:49.027 --> 08:52.011
	WHAT IT COSTS TO MAKE IT

08:49.027 --> 08:52.011
		IS DISTURBING,

08:52.013 --> 08:55.003
'CAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW IF

08:52.013 --> 08:55.003
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY HERE OR NOT.

08:55.004 --> 08:57.005
		WHAT DOES IT COST YOU

08:55.004 --> 08:57.005
	TO OPEN UP THE PLACE EVERY DAY?

08:57.006 --> 08:59.006
	Tonnie:

08:57.006 --> 08:59.006
		THE RENT WOULD BE $100 A DAY.

08:59.008 --> 09:01.009
		Lemonis: ALL THE EMPLOYEES --

08:59.008 --> 09:01.009
			HOW MUCH DO THEY COST A DAY?

09:01.010 --> 09:04.008
			Tonnie: AVERAGE DAY IS $180.

09:04.009 --> 09:06.013
-Lemonis: HOW ABOUT ELECTRICITY?

09:04.009 --> 09:06.013
-Tonnie: $75 A DAY.

09:06.014 --> 09:08.009
		Lemonis: HOW ABOUT INSURANCE?

09:06.014 --> 09:08.009
		HOW ABOUT MAINTENANCE?

09:08.010 --> 09:10.014
HOW ABOUT OFFICE SUPPLIES?

09:08.010 --> 09:10.014
			HOW ABOUT THE PHONE?

09:10.015 --> 09:12.024
		YOU'RE ALREADY WELL OVER $350.

09:12.025 --> 09:14.028
			WITH $500 A DAY IN REVENUE,

09:14.028 --> 09:17.025
	IF YOU FACTOR IN

09:14.028 --> 09:17.025
ALL OF THE OPERATING COSTS

09:17.027 --> 09:20.028
PLUS BAKED GOODS,

09:17.027 --> 09:20.028
PAPER SUPPLIES, ET CETERA,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.008
		HE'S ALREADY OPERATING

09:21.000 --> 09:23.008
AT A LOSS.

09:28.006 --> 09:30.015
TONNIE'S BEEN IN BUSINESS

09:28.006 --> 09:30.015
		FOR 12 YEARS,

09:30.017 --> 09:32.020
		AND HE STILL STRUGGLES

09:30.017 --> 09:32.020
	WITH THE BASICS.

09:32.022 --> 09:34.018
	BUT THE BIG QUESTION FOR ME IS,

09:34.019 --> 09:37.005
	IS HE WILLING TO DO WHAT

09:34.019 --> 09:37.005
		IT TAKES TO SAVE THE BUSINESS

09:37.006 --> 09:38.022
		AND PAY HIS WIFE BACK?

09:38.023 --> 09:42.014
I THINK THE WORRY THAT I HAVE IS

09:38.023 --> 09:42.014
		THAT YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE --

09:42.015 --> 09:43.024
ONE'S YOUR SISTER,

09:42.015 --> 09:43.024
	ONE'S YOUR WIFE.

09:43.025 --> 09:44.025
		YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO THEM.

09:44.027 --> 09:47.004
	WHAT CONFIDENCE

09:44.027 --> 09:47.004
WOULD I EVEN HAVE

09:47.005 --> 09:49.024
IN THE FACT THAT YOU'D LISTEN TO

09:47.005 --> 09:49.024
ME IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO THEM?

09:49.025 --> 09:52.009
	Tonnie:

09:49.025 --> 09:52.009
			BUT IF SOMEONE IS COMING IN

09:52.009 --> 09:53.018
THAT I THINK HAS DONE IT BEFORE,

09:53.019 --> 09:55.009
	IT JUST GIVES ME

09:53.019 --> 09:55.009
	A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

09:55.010 --> 09:57.004
	Lemonis:

09:55.010 --> 09:57.004
		WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE MATH.

09:57.004 --> 09:59.017
THE TOTAL REVENUE

09:57.004 --> 09:59.017
THAT IT SHOWS ON THIS B&L

09:59.018 --> 10:03.009
IS $250,000 FOR THE YEAR,

10:03.010 --> 10:05.018
		AND YOU LOST $76,000.

10:05.019 --> 10:08.005
			THERE'S THE $250,000

10:05.019 --> 10:08.005
	THAT YOU PUT IN.

10:08.006 --> 10:10.019
			FOR THIS DISCUSSION,

10:08.006 --> 10:10.019
	I CONSIDER THAT EQUITY.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.023
		BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE MARRIED.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.023
		THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

10:13.024 --> 10:16.025
		THAT'S THE FACT THAT YOU OWN,

10:13.024 --> 10:16.025
			TODAY, 100% OF THE BUSINESS.

10:16.027 --> 10:18.008
Erenisse: I AGREE.

10:18.009 --> 10:22.018
Lemonis: THERE'S $134,000

10:18.009 --> 10:22.018
		THAT IS OWED TO OTHER PEOPLE.

10:22.019 --> 10:25.024
		AND SO WHAT DO WE OWE

10:22.019 --> 10:25.024
		OTHER PEOPLE?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.023
	Tonnie:

10:25.025 --> 10:27.023
			THE PAYROLL TAX IS $11,000.

10:27.024 --> 10:30.019
	THE STATE TAX, $35,000.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.001
			THERE'S $15,000 IN ARREARS,

10:33.003 --> 10:37.005
OF WHICH IS FEBRUARY RENT

10:33.003 --> 10:37.005
AND WATER ESCROW.

10:37.006 --> 10:39.013
		-AND THEN LATE FEES.

10:37.006 --> 10:39.013
		-Erenisse: $15,000?

10:39.014 --> 10:41.018
	Tonnie:

10:39.014 --> 10:41.018
		THEN THERE'S DENISE, $12,000.

10:41.019 --> 10:44.010
ROBERT IS $25,000.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.015
			MY MOM FOR $13,000.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.015
			MICHELLE FOR $7,000.

10:47.017 --> 10:49.011
	Erenisse: WAIT A MINUTE.

10:49.013 --> 10:52.009
IS THIS FOR HER SERVICES,

10:49.013 --> 10:52.009
		OR SHE LENT YOU MONEY?

10:52.009 --> 10:53.019
		Tonnie: NO, THIS IS --

10:53.020 --> 10:55.024
		THIS IS HER LOANING ME

10:53.020 --> 10:55.024
THE MONEY.

11:01.004 --> 11:05.013
	SO [BLEEP] IS THE PERSON

11:01.004 --> 11:05.013
WHO I BORROWED MONEY FROM

11:05.014 --> 11:09.019
	AND HE PICKS UP

11:05.014 --> 11:09.019
A WEEKLY PAYMENT FROM ME.

11:09.019 --> 11:12.019
			Lemonis: LIKE A -- LIKE A --

11:09.019 --> 11:12.019
LIKE A LOAN SHARK?

11:12.020 --> 11:15.013
			Tonnie: YES.

11:16.024 --> 11:18.014
	Lemonis: IT CAN BE TOUGH

11:16.024 --> 11:18.014
			FOR A BUSINESS LIKE TONNIE'S

11:18.014 --> 11:19.023
		TO GET A BANK LOAN --

11:19.024 --> 11:21.001
		VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

11:21.003 --> 11:23.003
			SO YOU END UP GOING

11:21.003 --> 11:23.003
	TO SMALL LENDERS

11:23.004 --> 11:24.019
		WITH VERY HIGH INTEREST RATES,

11:24.020 --> 11:26.008
	AND IF YOU CAN'T PAY THEM BACK,

11:26.009 --> 11:28.027
			THEIR METHODS OF COLLECTING

11:26.009 --> 11:28.027
		ARE VERY UNORTHODOX --

11:28.028 --> 11:30.009
	OFTEN DANGEROUS.

11:30.010 --> 11:33.005
			THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER NUMBER

11:30.010 --> 11:33.005
	OF DEBT

11:33.006 --> 11:39.028
THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT

11:33.006 --> 11:39.028
		FOR A SINGLE-LOCATION BAKERY.

11:43.019 --> 11:45.017
		WHAT'S WRONG?

11:50.025 --> 11:55.005
Erenisse: I'M JUST UPSET,

11:50.025 --> 11:55.005
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

11:55.006 --> 11:57.023
	ALL THOSE PEOPLE

11:55.006 --> 11:57.023
		THAT WE OWE MONEY TO.

11:57.024 --> 12:01.000
	YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT.

12:02.006 --> 12:05.022
		SORRY.

12:08.004 --> 12:11.020
	Tonnie: I MEAN, YOU KNOW

12:08.004 --> 12:11.020
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING

12:11.022 --> 12:13.028
TO HAVE YOU SITTING HERE CRYING,

12:13.028 --> 12:17.000
BUT I DID WHATEVER I COULD

12:13.028 --> 12:17.000
			TO KEEP A DOOR OPEN,

12:17.001 --> 12:20.014
		TO KEEP FROM CLOSING,

12:17.001 --> 12:20.014
	TO PAY STAFF, WHATEVER IT TOOK.

12:20.014 --> 12:23.027
SO ME HIDING THESE NUMBERS

12:20.014 --> 12:23.027
			WAS NOT INTENTIONAL.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.024
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.024
	IT WAS FOOLISH.

12:25.024 --> 12:28.011
		WOULD IT HAPPEN AGAIN?

12:25.024 --> 12:28.011
			NEVER AGAIN.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.020
			Lemonis: IF I'M GONNA INVEST

12:28.013 --> 12:30.020
IN THIS BUSINESS,

12:30.022 --> 12:33.025
		TONNIE HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT

12:30.022 --> 12:33.025
			EVERYTHING IS GONNA CHANGE.

12:33.027 --> 12:36.019
			THE FACT THAT HE WAS WILLING

12:33.027 --> 12:36.019
			TO COME CLEAN WITH ERENISSE

12:36.020 --> 12:37.023
		IS A GOOD FIRST STEP,

12:37.024 --> 12:39.017
	BUT HE'S GOT A MOUNTAIN

12:37.024 --> 12:39.017
TO CLIMB.

12:39.018 --> 12:42.005
	THERE'S $134,000 WORTH OF DEBT,

12:42.006 --> 12:44.025
	AND SO FOR THIS BUSINESS

12:42.006 --> 12:44.025
	TO REALLY HAVE A CHANCE,

12:44.027 --> 12:49.024
		AND FOR THE $250,000

12:44.027 --> 12:49.024
THAT YOU'VE PUT IN THIS BUSINESS

12:49.025 --> 12:52.023
		TO BE WORTH SOMETHING,

12:49.025 --> 12:52.023
	WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.

12:52.024 --> 12:54.025
THE REASON

12:52.024 --> 12:54.025
			THAT I CAME TO THIS BUSINESS

12:54.027 --> 12:57.001
		WAS BECAUSE I LIKED YOUR IDEA.

12:57.003 --> 12:59.010
	AND SO NOW THAT

12:57.003 --> 12:59.010
I UNDERSTAND THESE NUMBERS

12:59.011 --> 13:00.017
		A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY,

13:00.018 --> 13:02.013
		I'M PREPARED TO MAKE AN OFFER.

13:02.014 --> 13:05.010
AND SO HERE'S MY OFFER --

13:05.011 --> 13:08.000
	I'M WILLING TO PUT UP $100,000.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.020
FOR THAT $100,000,

13:09.022 --> 13:13.024
		WE'RE GONNA SATISFY SOME OF

13:09.022 --> 13:13.024
THE DEBT THAT IS A REAL PROBLEM.

13:13.024 --> 13:16.004
			AND THE BALANCE IS GONNA GO

13:16.004 --> 13:19.019
INTO GETTING THIS LOCATION

13:16.004 --> 13:19.019
		REALLY RIGHT,

13:19.020 --> 13:21.017
		FROM THE LAYOUT TO THE PROCESS

13:21.018 --> 13:23.014
TO THE WAY

13:21.018 --> 13:23.014
		WE ORGANIZE OURSELVES.

13:23.015 --> 13:26.009
AND WE'RE GONNA UNDERSTAND

13:23.015 --> 13:26.009
			EVERY COST AND EVERY CORNER

13:26.010 --> 13:28.018
			AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE

13:26.010 --> 13:28.018
		AN INVENTORY PROCESS.

13:28.019 --> 13:29.018
		WE'RE GONNA KNOW OUR PRICING.

13:29.019 --> 13:31.009
		AND SO, I'M INTERESTED

13:31.009 --> 13:33.014
			IN INVESTING

13:31.009 --> 13:33.014
	IN THIS PARTICULAR IDEA.

13:33.014 --> 13:38.014
	SO MY OFFER IS $100,000

13:33.014 --> 13:38.014
	FOR 20% OF THE BUSINESS.

13:42.009 --> 13:44.020
Tonnie: I'M HAVING

13:42.009 --> 13:44.020
		A REALLY HARD TIME WITH THAT.

13:49.003 --> 13:51.001
			THE NUMBER I HAD IN MY MIND

13:49.003 --> 13:51.001
		WAS $600,000.

13:53.014 --> 13:55.025
	Lemonis: $600,000 FOR HOW MUCH?

13:55.027 --> 13:58.004
			Tonnie: I'D SAY 33%.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.018
Lemonis: YOU THOUGHT I WAS GONNA

13:58.005 --> 14:00.018
WRITE YOU A CHECK FOR $600,000,

14:00.019 --> 14:02.003
		EVERYBODY WAS GONNA GET PAID,

14:02.004 --> 14:04.000
			AND I WAS GONNA HAVE

14:02.004 --> 14:04.000
	A THIRD OF THE BUSINESS,

14:04.001 --> 14:06.013
			AND I WASN'T GONNA TELL YOU

14:04.001 --> 14:06.013
		WHAT YOU COULD OR COULDN'T DO?

14:06.014 --> 14:08.022
	-Tonnie: NO, NO. AND, AGAIN --

14:06.014 --> 14:08.022
	-Lemonis: WRONG SHOW.

14:11.009 --> 14:12.024
	WE'RE CLOSING THE STORE.

14:12.024 --> 14:14.018
			DO YOU THINK

14:12.024 --> 14:14.018
			I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU?

14:14.019 --> 14:15.014
			Tonnie: YES.

14:15.015 --> 14:16.017
			Lemonis: I DON'T WANT TO BE

14:16.018 --> 14:17.028
IN A RELATIONSHIP

14:16.018 --> 14:17.028
WHERE SOMEBODY FEELS LIKE

14:18.000 --> 14:19.006
	THEY'RE GETTING

14:18.000 --> 14:19.006
			TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

14:22.004 --> 14:23.006
Lemonis: YOU THOUGHT I WAS GONNA

14:22.020 --> 14:23.006
WRITE YOU A CHECK FOR $600,000,

14:25.009 --> 14:26.024
		EVERYBODY WAS GONNA GET PAID,

14:26.025 --> 14:28.010
			AND I WAS GONNA HAVE

14:26.025 --> 14:28.010
	A THIRD OF THE BUSINESS,

14:28.011 --> 14:30.009
			AND I WASN'T GONNA TELL YOU

14:28.011 --> 14:30.009
		WHAT YOU COULD OR COULDN'T DO?

14:30.009 --> 14:32.027
	-Tonnie: NO, NO. AND, AGAIN --

14:30.009 --> 14:32.027
	-Lemonis: WRONG SHOW.

14:35.024 --> 14:37.010
SO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING

14:35.024 --> 14:37.010
RIGHT NOW?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
			Erenisse: I'M THINKING THAT

14:42.000 --> 14:44.025
NOW I SEE WHY YOUR MOTHER

14:42.000 --> 14:44.025
			IS UNCOMFORTABLE SOMETIMES,

14:44.027 --> 14:47.019
			'CAUSE SHE PROBABLY WANTS TO

14:44.027 --> 14:47.019
		ASK YOU FOR THE MONEY,

14:47.019 --> 14:49.009
BUT SINCE

14:47.019 --> 14:49.009
	I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT,

14:49.009 --> 14:50.028
SHE CAN'T ASK YOU

14:49.009 --> 14:50.028
	IN FRONT OF ME.

14:50.028 --> 14:53.006
		Lemonis: WELL,

14:50.028 --> 14:53.006
		YOUR MOTHER'S $13,000, RIGHT?

14:53.008 --> 14:54.028
IF MY OFFER WAS $100,000,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
	I HAVE NO PROBLEM GOING

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
			TO $113,000,

14:57.001 --> 14:59.008
		SINCE IF MOM'S HAPPY,

14:57.001 --> 14:59.008
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

14:59.009 --> 15:01.014
		-DO YOU AGREE?

14:59.009 --> 15:01.014
		-Tamika: YEAH.

15:01.015 --> 15:03.025
Erenisse:

15:01.015 --> 15:03.025
		I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH [BLEEP]

15:03.027 --> 15:05.009
	Lemonis:

15:03.027 --> 15:05.009
	YOU MEAN THE LOAN SHARK?

15:05.010 --> 15:08.000
			Erenisse: YEAH. I DON'T KNOW

15:05.010 --> 15:08.000
			WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ABOUT.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.009
		I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

15:08.000 --> 15:10.009
THAT SCENARIO ALTOGETHER.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.005
		Lemonis: SO IT WOULD MAKE YOU

15:10.010 --> 15:12.005
	HAPPY IF THAT GOT PAID.

15:12.006 --> 15:13.000
		Erenisse: YES.

15:13.001 --> 15:14.018
		Lemonis: I AGREE WITH ERENISSE

15:14.019 --> 15:16.004
THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET RID

15:16.005 --> 15:18.009
			OF ALL THESE SORT OF

15:16.005 --> 15:18.009
		UNSCRUPULOUS LENDERS.

15:18.010 --> 15:20.010
		AND IF I'M GONNA BE ASSOCIATED

15:18.010 --> 15:20.010
WITH THE BUSINESS,

15:20.011 --> 15:23.000
			I DON'T WANT ANY CONNECTION

15:20.011 --> 15:23.000
		TO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.015
SO, THEN I'LL UP MY OFFER

15:23.000 --> 15:27.015
			TO $125,000,

15:27.017 --> 15:30.001
			AND INSTEAD OF 20%,

15:27.017 --> 15:30.001
	WE'LL GO TO 25%.

15:34.014 --> 15:38.020
AND I'M GIVING YOU

15:34.014 --> 15:38.020
		ABOUT, LIKE, MAYBE 10 SECONDS.

15:40.028 --> 15:45.000
Tamika: YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVING

15:40.028 --> 15:45.000
		FULL CONTROL ENDS UP BEING.

15:45.001 --> 15:48.009
	SO NOW SEE WHAT SHARING CONTROL

15:45.001 --> 15:48.009
		ENDS UP BEING.

15:48.009 --> 15:50.006
	Tonnie: AND SEE,

15:48.009 --> 15:50.006
		THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME.

15:50.008 --> 15:52.024
ONLY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

15:50.008 --> 15:52.024
			NO CONTROL OVER THAT NUMBER.

15:52.024 --> 15:56.022
IF WE START BUILDING OUT

15:52.024 --> 15:56.022
AND IT COSTS ME $50,000, THEN...

15:56.023 --> 16:00.001
		Lemonis: YOU HAVE $75,000 LEFT

15:56.023 --> 16:00.001
	TO PAY ALL THESE PEOPLE.

16:00.003 --> 16:01.009
		THAT'S RIGHT.

16:01.010 --> 16:02.013
		WHICH IS, BY THE WAY,

16:02.014 --> 16:04.014
$25,000 MORE THAN YOU HAD

16:02.014 --> 16:04.014
	10 MINUTES AGO.

16:04.014 --> 16:07.022
		SO...

16:07.023 --> 16:12.004
MY FINAL OFFER'S $125,000

16:12.005 --> 16:14.027
	FOR 25% OF THE BUSINESS.

16:20.001 --> 16:21.023
		WE GOT A DEAL?

16:21.024 --> 16:23.015
		Tonnie: WE GOT A DEAL, MARCUS.

16:23.017 --> 16:25.027
		Lemonis: YOU KNOW THAT

16:23.017 --> 16:25.027
	WHEN YOU TAKE MY CHECK,

16:25.028 --> 16:29.005
			I AM 100% IN CHARGE?

16:29.006 --> 16:30.015
Tonnie: 100% IN CHARGE YOU SAID?

16:30.017 --> 16:32.000
	Lemonis: SHE KNOWS THAT.

16:30.017 --> 16:32.000
THAT'S WHY SHE CALLED ME.

16:32.001 --> 16:34.001
SHE WANTS ME TO BE

16:32.001 --> 16:34.001
	100% IN CHARGE.

16:34.003 --> 16:36.028
			-IS THAT RIGHT?

16:34.003 --> 16:36.028
			-Erenisse: YES, ABSOLUTELY.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.001
		-THANK YOU.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.001
		-Lemonis: THANK YOU.

16:39.003 --> 16:41.005
		-Tamika: THANK YOU.

16:39.003 --> 16:41.005
		-Lemonis: THANK YOU.

16:47.020 --> 16:50.017
SO, LET ME TELL EVERYBODY

16:47.020 --> 16:50.017
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

16:50.018 --> 16:52.019
TONNIE AND I AND ERENISSE

16:50.018 --> 16:52.019
			MADE A DEAL

16:52.020 --> 16:55.008
FOR ME TO BECOME A PARTNER

16:52.020 --> 16:55.008
	IN THE BUSINESS,

16:55.009 --> 16:58.013
AND I'M GONNA PUT $125,000

16:55.009 --> 16:58.013
	IN THE BUSINESS.

16:58.014 --> 17:01.004
	A PORTION OF THAT MONEY

16:58.014 --> 17:01.004
	IS GONNA BE USED

17:01.004 --> 17:04.015
	TO PAY THE BILLS

17:01.004 --> 17:04.015
	THAT ARE NOT PAID TODAY.

17:04.016 --> 17:06.002
			AND WHETHER THAT'S THE RENT

17:06.005 --> 17:08.022
	OR PEOPLE THAT HAVE LENT

17:06.005 --> 17:08.022
THE COMPANY MONEY,

17:08.025 --> 17:10.017
		WE'RE GONNA PAY DOWN THE DEBT.

17:10.018 --> 17:11.021
		THE REST OF THAT MONEY

17:11.022 --> 17:14.006
	IS GONNA BE USED

17:11.022 --> 17:14.006
		TO RENOVATE THIS WHOLE PLACE.

17:14.007 --> 17:16.015
THE STORE IS GONNA CLOSE.

17:18.016 --> 17:21.005
		Tonnie: WE HAVE PEOPLE

17:18.016 --> 17:21.005
		WHO ARE RELYING ON ME.

17:21.006 --> 17:24.007
			IF WE'RE CLOSED, THAT MEANS

17:21.006 --> 17:24.007
THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING.

17:24.008 --> 17:25.021
Lemonis: IT MEANS

17:24.008 --> 17:25.021
			THAT I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

17:25.021 --> 17:27.007
		THEY GET PAID.

17:27.008 --> 17:30.022
Tonnie: MAYBE I'M STUCK

17:27.008 --> 17:30.022
ON THE FACT THAT I'M BEING TOLD.

17:30.023 --> 17:33.003
PERHAPS IT'S AN EGO THING,

17:30.023 --> 17:33.003
		BUT --

17:33.005 --> 17:34.009
		Tamika: STOP.

17:34.010 --> 17:37.017
			I'M GONNA CHOKE HIM

17:34.010 --> 17:37.017
		IN LIKE FIVE SECONDS.

17:38.023 --> 17:41.003
	JUST TRUST THE PROCESS.

17:41.005 --> 17:42.010
			Lemonis: I SEE THAT YOU SAID

17:42.011 --> 17:44.015
	IF HE TRUSTS THE PROCESS

17:42.011 --> 17:44.015
AND YOU TRUST THE PROCESS,

17:44.016 --> 17:45.021
			IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.008
			Tonnie: THAT'S IT. I GET IT.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.008
I'M GOOD.

17:48.009 --> 17:49.028
	Lemonis:

17:48.009 --> 17:49.028
THE GOAL GOING FORWARD IS

17:50.000 --> 17:52.012
	TO NOT ONLY FIX

17:50.000 --> 17:52.012
		THE LOOK OF THE STORE,

17:52.013 --> 17:53.019
	BUT TO FIX THE PROCESS.

17:53.019 --> 17:56.007
AND SO MY GOAL IS

17:53.019 --> 17:56.007
	TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

17:56.008 --> 17:59.018
		TO GENERATE MORE CASH WITHOUT

17:56.008 --> 17:59.018
ADDING MORE FIXED EXPENSE.

17:59.019 --> 18:02.016
	WE'RE NOT GONNA BE DOING

17:59.019 --> 18:02.016
		ANY SORT OF EXPANSION

18:02.017 --> 18:04.009
			UNTIL WE GET THIS ONE RIGHT.

18:08.007 --> 18:10.012
Tonnie: I WOULD LIKE TO BE

18:08.007 --> 18:10.012
		IN A POSITION

18:10.013 --> 18:13.016
			WHERE I CAN GROW THE COMPANY

18:10.013 --> 18:13.016
		AT THE SPEED THAT IT CAN GROW.

18:13.017 --> 18:16.016
		BUT I THINK WE'RE JUST

18:13.017 --> 18:16.016
		KIND OF CUTTING OFF OUR HANDS

18:16.017 --> 18:19.010
			BY LETTING GO OF THESE OTHER

18:16.017 --> 18:19.010
OPPORTUNITIES LIKE NEWARK.

18:19.011 --> 18:22.003
			SO FOR ME, IT'S A STRUGGLE.

18:22.005 --> 18:24.019
	Lemonis:

18:22.005 --> 18:24.019
		WE'RE NOT DOING ANY EXPANSION

18:24.019 --> 18:27.009
UNTIL THIS PLACE IS RIGHT.

18:27.010 --> 18:30.013
			BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE,

18:27.010 --> 18:30.013
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK HERE,

18:30.015 --> 18:31.017
	AND WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT

18:31.018 --> 18:33.001
			HOW MUCH IT COSTS US

18:31.018 --> 18:33.001
TO MAKE A CUPCAKE.

18:33.002 --> 18:34.023
	LIKE, RIGHT NOW.

18:38.013 --> 18:41.011
		LET'S GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER.

18:41.012 --> 18:42.023
	SO, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS

18:42.025 --> 18:45.011
			I WANT TO UNDERSTAND

18:42.025 --> 18:45.011
	THE COST OF ONE CUPCAKE.

18:45.012 --> 18:47.010
			I WANT THE RAW INGREDIENTS,

18:45.012 --> 18:47.010
			I WANT THE PACKAGE,

18:47.011 --> 18:48.026
	AND I WANT THE FROSTING

18:47.011 --> 18:48.026
AND THE SPRINKLES.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.005
		I WANT IT ALL.

18:50.006 --> 18:52.009
			IN ORDER FOR TONNIE'S MINIS

18:50.006 --> 18:52.009
		TO STOP LOSING MONEY,

18:52.009 --> 18:54.015
		WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT COSTS

18:52.009 --> 18:54.015
		TO MAKE THE PRODUCTS,

18:54.016 --> 18:56.021
			AND SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE TIME

18:54.016 --> 18:56.021
			TO FIND OUT

18:56.022 --> 18:58.021
		WHAT IT COSTS

18:56.022 --> 18:58.021
			TO MAKE ONE CUPCAKE.

18:58.022 --> 19:01.009
	AND SO YOU'RE TELLING ME

18:58.022 --> 19:01.009
	THAT ONE BATCH MAKES 24,

19:01.010 --> 19:03.000
SO WHEN WE ADD UP

19:01.010 --> 19:03.000
	ALL THESE COSTS,

19:03.001 --> 19:05.022
			WE'RE GONNA DIVIDE IT BY 24.

19:03.001 --> 19:05.022
	YOU READY TO GO?

19:05.023 --> 19:07.016
Tonnie: EGGS ARE 15 DOZEN.

19:07.017 --> 19:09.002
I PAY $24.

19:09.003 --> 19:11.025
Lemonis: 180 EGGS,

19:09.003 --> 19:11.025
		ABOUT 14 CENTS AN EGG.

19:11.026 --> 19:14.000
	-Tonnie: THIS NEEDS THREE EGGS.

19:11.026 --> 19:14.000
	-Lemonis: SO THAT'S 42 CENTS.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.019
		Tonnie: THE BUTTERMILK

19:14.000 --> 19:16.019
			IS $1.40 PER QUART,

19:16.020 --> 19:19.010
		AND WE USE 1 1/4 CUPS.

19:19.011 --> 19:21.006
	Lemonis: OKAY. 44 CENTS.

19:21.007 --> 19:22.016
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T LIKE

19:21.007 --> 19:22.016
	ABOUT THAT MATH?

19:22.017 --> 19:23.026
Tonnie: NO, IT JUST SEEMS HIGHER

19:22.017 --> 19:23.026
THAN I THOUGHT.

19:23.027 --> 19:26.021
			Lemonis: TONNIE HAS A HISTORY

19:23.027 --> 19:26.021
	OF GUESSING ON EVERYTHING,

19:26.022 --> 19:28.018
BUT THE ONE THING

19:26.022 --> 19:28.018
			HE SHOULDN'T BE GUESSING ON

19:28.019 --> 19:30.021
	IS WHAT IT COSTS TO MAKE

19:28.019 --> 19:30.021
			HIS MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCT,

19:30.022 --> 19:31.026
			THE CUPCAKE.

19:31.027 --> 19:35.000
			WE HAVE PAPER AND PACKAGING

19:31.027 --> 19:35.000
			AT 5 CENTS.

19:35.001 --> 19:37.002
			WE HAVE TOPPINGS AT 5 CENTS.

19:37.003 --> 19:42.003
$8.33 FOR MATERIALS ONLY.

19:42.005 --> 19:46.009
	WE'LL DIVIDE THAT BY 24.

19:42.005 --> 19:46.009
	35 CENTS APIECE.

19:46.009 --> 19:48.017
		BY THE WAY,

19:46.009 --> 19:48.017
YOU HAVEN'T FACTORED IN WASTE --

19:48.018 --> 19:51.003
			THE MISTAKES THAT YOU MAKE,

19:48.018 --> 19:51.003
		THE STUFF THAT DRIPS.

19:51.005 --> 19:54.016
SO IT'S ACTUALLY COSTS YOU

19:51.005 --> 19:54.016
			38 CENTS A CUPCAKE.

19:54.017 --> 19:58.008
		NOW WE HAVE 15 CENTS A CUPCAKE

19:54.017 --> 19:58.008
IN LABOR.

19:58.009 --> 20:00.026
	THAT'S 53 CENTS.

20:00.027 --> 20:04.018
SO 53 CENTS IS THE MINIMUM

20:00.027 --> 20:04.018
THAT IT COSTS TO MAKE THIS

20:04.019 --> 20:06.028
	BEFORE FACTORING IN THE LIGHTS,

20:04.019 --> 20:06.028
	THE ELECTRICITY,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.028
THE WORKER'S COMP,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.028
			THE TELEPHONE BILL,

20:08.028 --> 20:10.005
AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS.

20:10.006 --> 20:11.010
		Tonnie: RIGHT.

20:11.011 --> 20:13.021
Lemonis: THE FACT

20:11.011 --> 20:13.021
			THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW THE COST

20:13.022 --> 20:16.007
IS THE REASON THAT

20:13.022 --> 20:16.007
		THE BUSINESS WAS LOSING MONEY.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.001
		GOING FORWARD,

20:16.008 --> 20:18.001
			I NEED TO FIGURE OUT

20:18.002 --> 20:19.027
		A WAY TO LOWER

20:18.002 --> 20:19.027
			HIS PRODUCTION COSTS

20:19.028 --> 20:22.023
SO THAT WHEN TONNIE SELLS,

20:19.028 --> 20:22.023
			HE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY.

20:22.025 --> 20:24.000
FEEL LIKE YOU GOT

20:22.025 --> 20:24.000
		SOMETHING OUT OF THAT?

20:24.001 --> 20:25.001
			Tamika: YES, I DID.

20:25.002 --> 20:26.021
			Lemonis: ALL RIGHT.

20:25.002 --> 20:26.021
THANK YOU.

20:26.022 --> 20:27.026
Tamika: THANK YOU.

20:33.016 --> 20:37.000
	Lemonis: FREE CUPCAKES.

20:33.016 --> 20:37.000
			FREE CUPCAKES FOR EVERYBODY.

20:37.001 --> 20:38.005
		Woman: OH, DELIGHTFUL.

20:38.006 --> 20:39.023
Lemonis: TONIGHT'S

20:38.006 --> 20:39.023
THE LAST TIME WE'RE OPEN.

20:41.017 --> 20:43.009
	WE'RE CLOSING THE STORE.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.028
			Woman: AWW.

20:44.028 --> 20:46.028
	Man: ALL RIGHT.

20:46.028 --> 20:49.009
	Tonnie: SO, WHAT HAPPENS

20:46.028 --> 20:49.009
	WITH TOMORROW'S ORDERS?

20:49.009 --> 20:50.019
		Lemonis: WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE

20:50.020 --> 20:52.019
THAT EVERY ORDER FOR EVERY

20:50.020 --> 20:52.019
			CUSTOMER GETS TAKEN CARE OF.

20:52.019 --> 20:54.019
			-Tamika: OKAY.

20:52.019 --> 20:54.019
			-Tonnie: [ SIGHS ]

20:54.019 --> 20:56.009
	Lemonis: TONNIE,

20:54.019 --> 20:56.009
WE'RE NOT CLOSING FOREVER.

20:56.010 --> 20:57.028
			TONNIE'S HAVING A HARD TIME

20:56.010 --> 20:57.028
			TRUSTING ME,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.019
BUT I'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO DAYS,

20:59.020 --> 21:02.023
		AND IT'S OBVIOUS THIS PLACE

20:59.020 --> 21:02.023
IS STRUGGLING WITH THE WORKFLOW.

21:02.025 --> 21:05.028
		IT'S NOT GOOD FOR CUSTOMERS,

21:02.025 --> 21:05.028
AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR EMPLOYEES.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.028
	WE NEED TO TOTALLY REDO

21:06.000 --> 21:07.028
			THIS PLACE,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.020
	AND WE'RE GONNA START TOMORROW.

21:09.021 --> 21:12.025
	WE'RE GONNA RIP

21:09.021 --> 21:12.025
			THIS [BLEEP] APART.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.016
		WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD

21:14.011 --> 21:16.016
RIGHT NOW?

21:16.017 --> 21:21.028
			Tonnie: UH [ CHUCKLES ] YOU

21:16.017 --> 21:21.028
	KNOW, IT'S JUST KIND OF SUDDEN.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.018
		I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE

21:22.000 --> 21:24.018
SOME NOTICE OF SOME SORT.

21:24.019 --> 21:26.010
Lemonis: WELL, RIGHT NOW,

21:24.019 --> 21:26.010
		WE'RE LOSING MONEY EVERY DAY,

21:26.011 --> 21:27.020
AND SO I'M TRYING

21:26.011 --> 21:27.020
		TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

21:27.021 --> 21:29.012
		Tonnie: YOU DON'T SAY,

21:27.021 --> 21:29.012
			"TONNIE, GUESS WHAT?

21:29.013 --> 21:30.028
WE GOT 10 MINUTES

21:29.013 --> 21:30.028
			TO CLEAR THE HOUSE.

21:30.028 --> 21:32.002
		WE'RE GONNA CLOSE THE STORE."

21:33.019 --> 21:36.013
		PEOPLE TEND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

21:33.019 --> 21:36.013
	OF MY NICENESS.

21:37.022 --> 21:39.017
		Lemonis: DO YOU THINK

21:37.022 --> 21:39.017
			I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU?

21:39.018 --> 21:41.009
Tonnie: IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE

21:39.018 --> 21:41.009
			AS YES OR NO ANSWER.

21:41.010 --> 21:43.023
		Lemonis: TAMIKA, DO YOU THINK

21:41.010 --> 21:43.023
			I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU?

21:43.025 --> 21:44.025
			Tamika: NO.

21:44.026 --> 21:46.002
	Lemonis: OKAY.

21:44.026 --> 21:46.002
THAT WAS A YES OR A NO.

21:46.003 --> 21:47.013
	DO YOU THINK I'M TAKING

21:46.003 --> 21:47.013
ADVANTAGE OF YOU?

21:48.020 --> 21:50.009
			Tonnie: YES.

21:50.010 --> 21:52.018

21:50.010 --> 21:52.018
			I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU,

21:52.019 --> 21:54.010
		IT'S BEEN AWESOME KNOWING YOU,

21:52.019 --> 21:54.010
NICE MEETING YOU.

WHERE SOMEBODY FEELS LIKE

22:23.018 --> 22:26.015
		FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS

22:26.016 --> 22:28.008
	AT RUNNING MY BUSINESS.

22:29.019 --> 22:30.028
	Tonnie: NO, SEE,

22:29.019 --> 22:30.028
	BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,

		YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.009
		THIS IS GREAT.

22:44.009 --> 22:46.006

'CAUSE I KNOW AT THE END,

		IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING.

22:47.028 --> 22:49.008
			THAT I KNOW.

22:49.009 --> 22:51.018
			IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

		THE STRUGGLE WITH IT.

			Lemonis: TONNIE, NO.

22:54.021 --> 22:56.016
HONESTLY, THAT WAS

23:24.026 --> 23:29.025
			Lauren: OH, MY GOSH.

23:24.026 --> 23:29.025
		THIS IS AMA-- I'M SPEECHLESS.

23:29.026 --> 23:31.020
Lemonis: IN ORDER

23:29.026 --> 23:31.020
			FOR THIS PLACE TO FUNCTION,

23:31.021 --> 23:33.028
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE IT

23:31.021 --> 23:33.028
		ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE STUDS.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
	-ALL THIS IS GETTING --

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
	-[ GLASS SHATTERS ]

23:36.000 --> 23:39.002
I WANT TO CREATE A LAYOUT

23:39.003 --> 23:40.026
		THAT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE

23:39.003 --> 23:40.026
	WHO WORK HERE...

23:40.027 --> 23:43.005
Lauren: EXCUSE ME.

23:40.027 --> 23:43.005
	COMING THROUGH.

23:43.006 --> 23:45.015
Lemonis: ...AND SHOP HERE.

23:45.016 --> 23:48.005
	WATCH THE STUFF

23:45.016 --> 23:48.005
ON THE TOP OF IT.

23:48.006 --> 23:49.026
		SO WHEN THEY WALK IN,

23:48.006 --> 23:49.026
		THEY SEE THE CUPCAKES.

23:49.027 --> 23:51.005
		THEN THERE'S A STATION

23:51.006 --> 23:54.000
		WHERE THEY PICK THEIR FROSTING

23:51.006 --> 23:54.000
			AND THEIR TOPPINGS.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.023
			THERE'S A NATURAL BEGINNING

23:54.000 --> 23:56.023
			AND AN END.

23:56.025 --> 24:00.019
		CAREFUL, GUYS.

23:56.025 --> 24:00.019
			DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FLOOR.

24:10.006 --> 24:13.000
			Tonnie: I KNOW YOU GOT SOME

24:10.006 --> 24:13.000
RESERVATIONS ABOUT NEWARK,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.020
			BUT I TRULY BELIEVE

24:13.000 --> 24:15.020
	THAT IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY

24:15.021 --> 24:19.000
	TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS

24:15.021 --> 24:19.000
		WITH THE SAME TYPE OF SETUP --

24:19.000 --> 24:21.007
			Lemonis: BUT DON'T YOU THINK

24:19.000 --> 24:21.007
	YOU SHOULD GET ONE RIGHT FIRST?

24:21.008 --> 24:23.002
Tonnie: ONE RIGHT IS EASY.

24:21.008 --> 24:23.002
		I'M GONNA GET IT DONE.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.028
			I HAVE YOUR SUPPORT.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.028
			I'VE GOT THE TEAM AROUND ME.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.011
		Lemonis: IT'S NOT UNUSUAL THAT

24:25.000 --> 24:27.011
		PEOPLE WANT TO EXPAND QUICKLY,

24:27.012 --> 24:28.028
BUT IF YOU DO IT TOO SOON,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.011
	IT COULD DESTROY

24:29.000 --> 24:31.011
		A PROMISING BUSINESS.

24:31.012 --> 24:34.027
BUT BEING A GOOD PARTNER

24:31.012 --> 24:34.027
REQUIRES YOU TO LISTEN TO IDEAS,

24:34.028 --> 24:37.011
			EVEN WHEN YOU KNOW

24:34.028 --> 24:37.011
THEY'RE TERRIBLE FROM THE START.

24:37.012 --> 24:38.023
		I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE DRIVE,

24:38.025 --> 24:41.000
		BUT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,

24:38.025 --> 24:41.000
I AM NOT COMMITTING TO IT.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.003
	SO, ME AGREEING

24:41.000 --> 24:43.003
			TO GO LOOK AT IT...

24:43.005 --> 24:44.013
			Tonnie: FAIR ENOUGH.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.010
		Lemonis: ...IS BECAUSE

24:44.015 --> 24:46.010
		I WANT TO AT LEAST, YOU KNOW,

24:46.011 --> 24:48.000
	GIVE YOU

24:46.011 --> 24:48.000
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.011
		BUT, I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

24:48.000 --> 24:50.011
		TO BE AIRTIGHT WITH YOUR PLAN.

24:50.012 --> 24:51.012
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOW

24:51.013 --> 24:52.028
			EXACTLY WHAT

24:51.013 --> 24:52.028
		YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:52.028 --> 24:54.018
		Tonnie: WELL,

24:52.028 --> 24:54.018
	THERE WILL BE A DILEMMA,

24:54.019 --> 24:56.009
	BECAUSE THE AREA'S STILL

24:54.019 --> 24:56.009
		UP-AND-COMING.

24:56.009 --> 24:58.019
		Lemonis: YOU FEEL LIKE

24:56.009 --> 24:58.019
YOU'VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH

24:58.019 --> 24:59.023
	AND YOU'RE READY TO GO?

24:59.025 --> 25:01.009
	Tonnie: MY ANSWER'S YES.

25:01.010 --> 25:02.017
		Lemonis: OKAY.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.018
SO, WHAT IS THIS BUILDING?

25:09.019 --> 25:12.022
	Tonnie: THIS ACTUALLY IS

25:09.019 --> 25:12.022
60,000 SQUARE FEET

25:12.023 --> 25:14.009
OF RETAIL SPACE COMING IN.

25:14.009 --> 25:17.020
		Lemonis: HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU

25:14.009 --> 25:17.020
			IN DISCUSSIONS HERE?

25:17.021 --> 25:19.027
			Tonnie: THE LEASE WAS SIGNED

25:17.021 --> 25:19.027
		AT THIS POINT.

25:19.028 --> 25:21.021
			Lemonis: A LEASE WAS SIGNED?

25:21.022 --> 25:23.001
Tonnie: IT'S BEEN SIGNED.

25:24.022 --> 25:28.017
		Lemonis: YOU HAVE ONE LOCATION

25:24.022 --> 25:28.017
THAT'S IN TOTAL DISREPAIR,

25:28.018 --> 25:32.003
AND YOU'RE SEVERAL HUNDRED

25:28.018 --> 25:32.003
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT,

25:32.005 --> 25:34.019
		AND YOU'RE STILL FEELING LIKE

25:32.005 --> 25:34.019
			THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

25:34.019 --> 25:36.012
Tonnie: I KNOW IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

25:36.013 --> 25:41.013
			Lemonis: I DON'T MIND IDEAS,

25:36.013 --> 25:41.013
			BUT I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES.

25:41.015 --> 25:44.026
		WHAT AM I GONNA FIND OUT NEXT?

25:41.015 --> 25:44.026
WE HAVE A STORE IN BOSTON?

25:44.027 --> 25:47.006
Tonnie: THIS WAS GONNA BE

25:44.027 --> 25:47.006
			THE BEGINNING HERE,

25:47.007 --> 25:48.002
		GIVE OR TAKE.

25:48.003 --> 25:50.019
			DOOR'S HERE.

25:48.003 --> 25:50.019
		RETAIL SPACE.

25:50.020 --> 25:53.022
	AND THE REMAINING PART,

25:50.020 --> 25:53.022
	THE COMMISSARY.

25:53.023 --> 25:56.013
		SO, THAT WAS THE INITIAL PLAN.

25:56.015 --> 25:59.003
Lemonis: WHAT ARE YOUR PROJECTED

25:56.015 --> 25:59.003
SALES FOR THIS LOCATION?

25:59.005 --> 26:00.000
		Tonnie: $590 PER DAY.

26:00.001 --> 26:01.016
			Lemonis: OH, SO $590 OF CASH

26:01.017 --> 26:03.015
			IS GONNA GO THROUGH

26:01.017 --> 26:03.015
		YOUR REGISTER.

26:03.016 --> 26:05.022
			HOW MUCH IS GONNA GO TOWARDS

26:03.016 --> 26:05.022
		PAYING THE EMPLOYEES?

26:05.023 --> 26:08.019
			Tonnie: WE SCHEDULED

26:05.023 --> 26:08.019
			TWO EMPLOYEES FOR THE FRONT

26:08.020 --> 26:12.017
AND IN THE WHOLESALE DEPARTMENT,

26:08.020 --> 26:12.017
	THERE'S FOUR.

26:12.018 --> 26:14.023
			Lemonis: YOU'LL HAVE

26:12.018 --> 26:14.023
SIX PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE

26:14.025 --> 26:16.006
		AT AN AVERAGE OF $10 AN HOUR,

26:16.007 --> 26:17.028
		SO THAT'S $60 AN HOUR.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.019
		AND $60 AN HOUR TIMES 8 HOURS

26:18.000 --> 26:22.019
	IS $480 A DAY IN LABOR.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.027
		Tonnie: OKAY.

26:23.028 --> 26:25.016
			Lemonis: HOW MUCH IS

26:23.028 --> 26:25.016
	YOUR RENT HERE A MONTH?

26:25.017 --> 26:27.005
	Tonnie: $2,600.

26:27.006 --> 26:29.009
			Lemonis: SO ABOUT $100 A DAY

26:27.006 --> 26:29.009
ON AVERAGE, RIGHT?

26:29.009 --> 26:31.019
		SO NOW WE'RE AT $580.

26:29.009 --> 26:31.019
			YOU JUST LOST MONEY.

26:31.019 --> 26:35.015
Tonnie: IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE

26:31.019 --> 26:35.015
		AS JUST SAYING YOUR SIX STAFF

26:35.016 --> 26:37.006
TIMES WHATEVER THE NUMBER

26:35.016 --> 26:37.006
YOU'RE GIVING ME.

26:37.007 --> 26:39.000
	IT DOESN'T --

26:37.007 --> 26:39.000
IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WAY.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.019
-IT MAY -- IT MAY WORK --

26:39.000 --> 26:40.019
-Lemonis: NO, NO, NO, NO.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.027
	LET ME GIVE YOU

26:40.020 --> 26:41.027
			A LITTLE NEWS FLASH.

26:41.028 --> 26:43.003
		IT DOES	 WORK THAT WAY.

26:43.005 --> 26:46.012
TONNIE'S NOT A GUY

26:43.005 --> 26:46.012
		THAT LACKS INTEGRITY.

26:46.013 --> 26:48.010
		HE LACKS GOOD BUSINESS LOGIC.

26:48.011 --> 26:50.019
		THIS LOCATION

26:48.011 --> 26:50.019
	WOULD BARELY BREAK EVEN,

26:50.019 --> 26:52.000
	AND PROBABLY LOSE MONEY.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.003
		AND HE WANTS TO BUILD

26:52.001 --> 26:54.003
			A COMMISSARY

26:54.005 --> 26:55.019
			FOR HIS WHOLESALE BUSINESS.

26:55.020 --> 26:57.019
			BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE

26:55.020 --> 26:57.019
	ANY WHOLESALE BUSINESS.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.017
		I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

26:59.018 --> 27:02.019
	IN THIS MOMENT,

26:59.018 --> 27:02.019
		I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS IDEA.

27:04.006 --> 27:06.007
			BECAUSE THE NUMBERS

27:04.006 --> 27:06.007
	AREN'T WELL-THOUGHT OUT.

27:06.008 --> 27:10.010
Tonnie: I CAN ONLY ACCEPT

27:06.008 --> 27:10.010
	AND TAKE SO MUCH ABUSE.

27:10.011 --> 27:12.000
	Lemonis:

27:10.011 --> 27:12.000
	IF YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF ABUSE,

27:12.001 --> 27:13.009
		I DON'T APPRECIATE IT.

27:13.010 --> 27:15.008
		Tonnie: NO, BUT LISTEN TO WHAT

27:13.010 --> 27:15.008
	I'M SAYING FOR A SECOND.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.018
		I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE

27:15.009 --> 27:16.018
		TO FIGURE OUT

27:16.019 --> 27:18.012
			HOW TO LAND

27:16.019 --> 27:18.012
		ON THE HIGHEST GROUND.

27:18.013 --> 27:19.020
	Lemonis:

27:18.013 --> 27:19.020
			WE'RE JUST GONNA BE HONEST.

27:19.021 --> 27:21.000
			FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT,

27:21.001 --> 27:23.001
YOU HAVEN'T ALWAYS

27:21.001 --> 27:23.001
			JUST FIGURED IT OUT.

27:23.002 --> 27:24.016
	Tonnie: REALLY?

27:24.017 --> 27:26.013
		Lemonis: YEAH, REALLY.

27:26.015 --> 27:29.007
EXPANSION IS A GREAT IDEA

27:29.008 --> 27:31.025
IF YOU HAVE YOUR HOME BASE

27:29.008 --> 27:31.025
IN ORDER.

27:31.026 --> 27:35.002
		I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE

27:31.026 --> 27:35.002
	YOUR HOME BASE IN ORDER.

27:37.009 --> 27:39.019
		Tamika: OKAY.

27:42.025 --> 27:44.001
	Erenisse: I WANT TO KNOW

27:42.025 --> 27:44.001
			WHEN THE MONEY'S COMING IN.

27:44.002 --> 27:45.002
			THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

27:45.003 --> 27:48.001
		BECAUSE AT THIS POINT,

27:45.003 --> 27:48.001
	WE'RE MAXED OUT.

27:52.009 --> 27:53.000
 Lemonis:

27:52.015 --> 27:53.000
 SO, EXPANSION IS A GREAT IDEA

27:54.020 --> 27:57.000
IF YOU HAVE YOUR HOME BASE

27:54.020 --> 27:57.000
IN ORDER.

27:57.001 --> 28:00.008
		I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE

27:57.001 --> 28:00.008
	YOUR HOME BASE IN ORDER.

28:02.026 --> 28:04.025
		Tamika: OKAY.

28:04.026 --> 28:07.008
		Lemonis: TONNIE THINKS

28:04.026 --> 28:07.008
	I'M ABUSING HIM,

28:07.009 --> 28:08.013
	WHEN IN REALITY,

28:08.015 --> 28:11.003
		I'M TRYING TO GET HIM

28:08.015 --> 28:11.003
TO ANSWER REAL QUESTIONS.

28:11.005 --> 28:13.015
	TO TELL YOU THAT

28:11.005 --> 28:13.015
	MY HEAD POPPED OFF MY SHOULDERS

28:13.016 --> 28:14.025
			WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.007
Tamika: WHAT'S UP?

28:16.008 --> 28:17.017
			Tonnie: I'M JUST RUNNING OUT

28:16.008 --> 28:17.017
			OF PATIENCE.

28:17.018 --> 28:20.001
Tamika: I MEAN, I WILL SAY

28:20.002 --> 28:24.009
		THE WAY THAT BUSINESS

28:20.002 --> 28:24.009
			HAS BEEN RUN -- DESTRUCTIVE.

28:24.010 --> 28:26.009
Tonnie: BUT I WAS DOING IT

28:24.010 --> 28:26.009
BY MYSELF.

28:26.010 --> 28:27.022
		Tamika: OH, HERE'S MARCUS NOW.

28:31.027 --> 28:34.003
		WELCOME BACK.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.005
		Lemonis: THOUGHT I'D COOL OFF.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.006
		Tonnie: I'M NOT USED TO BEING

28:37.006 --> 28:39.006
		SPOKEN TO IN THAT KIND OF WAY.

28:39.007 --> 28:42.025
			I GET YOU DON'T SEE

28:39.007 --> 28:42.025
		WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

28:42.026 --> 28:45.019
			Lemonis: ACTUALLY, I DO GET

28:42.026 --> 28:45.019
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

28:45.019 --> 28:48.003
		BUT I AM HERE

28:48.005 --> 28:50.017
			TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK

28:48.005 --> 28:50.017
ABOUT THINGS IN BUSINESS.

28:50.018 --> 28:51.025
	TONNIE'S UPSET,

28:51.026 --> 28:53.025
BUT I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS

28:51.026 --> 28:53.025
		WHY THIS IS A BAD IDEA

28:53.026 --> 28:55.002
		AND HE CAN'T DO THIS,

28:55.003 --> 28:57.027
	AND HE REALIZES

28:55.003 --> 28:57.027
	HE HAS TO GET OUT OF HIS LEASE.

28:57.028 --> 29:00.002
	I AM GOING TO BE

28:57.028 --> 29:00.002
			LIKE A DOG ON A BONE

29:00.003 --> 29:01.016
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET GO.

29:01.017 --> 29:04.013
Tonnie: AND I THINK I NEED THAT.

29:01.017 --> 29:04.013
	YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:04.015 --> 29:07.012
	Lemonis: TONNIE'S A FRUSTRATING

29:04.015 --> 29:07.012
	GUY TO DO BUSINESS WITH,

29:07.013 --> 29:09.009
			AND I OFTEN

29:07.013 --> 29:09.009
		HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF

29:09.010 --> 29:11.010
	THAT I MADE A COMMITMENT

29:09.010 --> 29:11.010
		TO COME HERE AND HELP

29:11.011 --> 29:15.000
			NOT ONLY HIM BUT HIS FAMILY

29:11.011 --> 29:15.000
		AND THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
		BUT IT'S HARD.

29:16.001 --> 29:17.009
	WE HAVE TO PROVE

29:17.010 --> 29:20.023
		THAT WE CAN MAKE MONEY

29:17.010 --> 29:20.023
WITHOUT ADDING LOCATIONS,

29:20.025 --> 29:21.025
	AND WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS

29:21.026 --> 29:23.009
			TO ACTUALLY PUT CASH

29:21.026 --> 29:23.009
			IN THE BANK.

29:23.010 --> 29:24.017
	AND UNTIL THAT HAPPENS,

29:24.018 --> 29:26.017
		WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING

29:24.018 --> 29:26.017
		ANYTHING ELSE.

29:26.018 --> 29:28.028
-Tamika: OKAY.

29:26.018 --> 29:28.028
-Tonnie: OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

29:35.009 --> 29:36.027
			Lemonis: HEY, GUYS.

29:36.028 --> 29:38.006
	-Tonnie: MARCUS.

29:36.028 --> 29:38.006
	-Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

29:38.007 --> 29:41.019
	TODAY, I'M TAKING TONNIE

29:38.007 --> 29:41.019
			TO MELITA'S BAKERY,

29:41.020 --> 29:46.005
	A 47,000-SQUARE-FOOT PRODUCTION

29:41.020 --> 29:46.005
		FACILITY LOCATED IN THE BRONX.

29:48.027 --> 29:50.002
			Tamika: WOW.

29:50.003 --> 29:52.018
Tonnie: [ LAUGHS ]

29:52.019 --> 29:53.028
		THIS IS A BAKERY, HUH?

29:55.020 --> 29:58.021
			Tamika: OH, MY GOSH.

29:55.020 --> 29:58.021
		FULL-SCALE OPERATION.

29:58.022 --> 30:02.006
			Lemonis: I HAVE AN IDEA FOR

29:58.022 --> 30:02.006
	TONNIE TO PARTNER WITH MELITA'S

30:02.007 --> 30:04.022
	BECAUSE THEY'LL ACTUALLY

30:02.007 --> 30:04.022
			GIVE HIM THE ABILITY

30:04.023 --> 30:06.011
		TO LOWER HIS PRODUCTION COSTS.

30:06.012 --> 30:09.008
MANNY, THIS IS MY FRIEND TONNIE.

30:09.009 --> 30:10.010
Manny: HI, TONNIE.

30:10.011 --> 30:12.017
-Lemonis: THIS IS TAMIKA.

30:10.011 --> 30:12.017
-Manny: HI, TAMIKA.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.010
Lemonis: LOOK, MANNY DOES

30:14.011 --> 30:16.003
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR

30:14.011 --> 30:16.003
			IN BUSINESS,

30:16.005 --> 30:17.023
	AND SO I THOUGHT

30:16.005 --> 30:17.023
		IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT

30:17.025 --> 30:20.017
			FOR YOU TO SEE HOW

30:17.025 --> 30:20.017
A VERY EFFICIENT PROCESS WORKED.

30:20.018 --> 30:23.020
SO, WHAT DOES IT COST YOU

30:20.018 --> 30:23.020
	TO MAKE A BASIC CUPCAKE?

30:23.021 --> 30:25.028
		-Manny: 44 CENTS.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.028
		-Tonnie: SO 44 CENTS?

30:25.028 --> 30:28.002
		Lemonis: THAT'S ABOUT

30:25.028 --> 30:28.002
	9 CENTS CHEAPER, RIGHT?

30:28.003 --> 30:29.012
			Tonnie: RIGHT. YEAH.

30:29.013 --> 30:31.015
	Lemonis:

30:29.013 --> 30:31.015
		HE CAN MAKE THE SAME PRODUCTS

30:31.016 --> 30:33.017
			FOR 18% LESS

30:31.016 --> 30:33.017
THAN YOU CAN MAKE IT FOR.

30:33.018 --> 30:37.005
			AND SO IF THE BREAK EVEN IS

30:33.018 --> 30:37.005
	LOWER, WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO DO?

30:37.006 --> 30:38.027
	Tonnie: MAKE MORE MONEY

30:37.006 --> 30:38.027
	ON EACH CUPCAKE.

30:38.028 --> 30:42.003
		Lemonis: WITH AN 18% REDUCTION

30:38.028 --> 30:42.003
			IN PRODUCTION COSTS,

30:42.005 --> 30:43.027
IT'S A NO-BRAINER

30:42.005 --> 30:43.027
	TO USE MELITA'S

30:43.028 --> 30:45.021
			INSTEAD OF TONNIE'S

30:43.028 --> 30:45.021
		SMALL KITCHEN.

30:45.022 --> 30:47.005
			BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

30:47.006 --> 30:50.000
	THE $250,000 OF REVENUE

30:47.006 --> 30:50.000
THEY DO ANNUALLY,

30:50.001 --> 30:53.011
AND YOU FACTOR IN

30:50.001 --> 30:53.011
			THE 18% OF SAVINGS,

30:53.012 --> 30:56.028
			WELL, THAT'S $45,000

30:53.012 --> 30:56.028
			IN ADDITIONAL GROSS PROFIT.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.001
THAT'S REAL MONEY.

30:58.002 --> 30:59.003
		SO, HERE'S THE DEAL --

30:59.005 --> 31:00.025
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE

31:00.026 --> 31:02.026
	EVERYTHING THAT YOU SOLD

31:00.026 --> 31:02.026
LAST YEAR

31:02.027 --> 31:05.019
AND SOMEBODY ELSE

31:02.027 --> 31:05.019
		WITH A MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS

31:05.020 --> 31:08.020
MADE THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT

31:05.020 --> 31:08.020
OF PRODUCT THAT YOU MADE,

31:08.021 --> 31:10.013
		HOW MUCH MORE

31:08.021 --> 31:10.013
			WOULD YOU HAVE MADE?

31:10.015 --> 31:11.008
			18% TO 20%.

31:11.009 --> 31:12.015
		Tonnie: YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:12.016 --> 31:14.007
			Lemonis: AND SO I WANT TO BE

31:12.016 --> 31:14.007
		VERY CLEAR --

31:14.008 --> 31:15.028
	YOU CANNOT BAKE ANYMORE

31:14.008 --> 31:15.028
		IN THAT SHOP.

31:15.028 --> 31:18.002
	AT ALL.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.002
	Tamika: BUT THE BRAND --

31:27.003 --> 31:30.018
		IT WOULDN'T BE TONNIE'S MINIS

31:27.003 --> 31:30.018
IF IT WASN'T HIS RECIPES.

31:30.019 --> 31:31.028
	Lemonis:

31:30.019 --> 31:31.028
		OH, IT'S GONNA BE HIS RECIPE.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.015
	-YOU MEAN OF THE CAKES?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.015
	-Tamika: OKAY, YEAH.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.010
			Lemonis: SURE, BUT HE'S NOT

31:33.016 --> 31:35.010
		GONNA BE MAKING THEM.

31:35.011 --> 31:36.020
		Tonnie: YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:35.011 --> 31:36.020
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:36.021 --> 31:37.028
			THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD LOOK.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.019
	THIS IS THE WAY

31:38.000 --> 31:39.019
IT SHOULD BE DONE.

31:39.019 --> 31:42.026
			Lemonis: AND SO I'D LIKE YOU

31:39.019 --> 31:42.026
TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS

31:42.027 --> 31:46.009
	THAT COULD BE SIGNATURE

31:42.027 --> 31:46.009
	TONNIE'S MINIS CUPCAKES.

31:46.009 --> 31:48.005
	Tamika:

31:46.009 --> 31:48.005
			GET BACK TO THE BASICS, BRO.

31:48.006 --> 31:50.015
Tonnie: MY MOM'S CARROT'S

31:48.006 --> 31:50.015
	KIND OF HOW IT STARTED.

31:50.016 --> 31:52.016
			Lemonis: SO THE CARROT CAKE

31:50.016 --> 31:52.016
		IS YOUR MOM'S?

31:52.017 --> 31:54.011
		-Tonnie: IT'S MY MOM'S, YEAH.

31:52.017 --> 31:54.011
			-Lemonis: OKAY. I LIKE THAT.

31:54.012 --> 31:56.020
	-WHAT ELSE?

31:54.012 --> 31:56.020
	-Tonnie: SWEET POTATO.

31:56.021 --> 32:00.001
	CHOCOLATE KISS.

31:56.021 --> 32:00.001
STRAWBERRY LEMON.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.017
	Tamika:

32:00.002 --> 32:02.017
		THE PISTACHIO CUPCAKE ROCKED.

32:02.018 --> 32:03.028
			Lemonis: GREAT. I LOVE THAT.

32:03.028 --> 32:05.009
		THE BEST THING ABOUT TODAY IS

32:05.010 --> 32:07.009
			THAT TONNIE

32:05.010 --> 32:07.009
		IS FINALLY RECOGNIZING

32:07.009 --> 32:09.009
		THAT THE MARGIN OF 18%

32:07.009 --> 32:09.009
		IS IMPORTANT.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.028
BUT WHAT'S EVEN BETTER IS

32:09.010 --> 32:11.028
	THAT I CAN GET TONNIE REFOCUSED

32:12.000 --> 32:14.009
		ON WHAT HE'S BEST AT,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.009
			AND THAT'S SELLING.

32:14.009 --> 32:16.000
			Tonnie: I'M ACTUALLY

32:14.009 --> 32:16.000
			GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

32:20.010 --> 32:22.010
Man: DO YOU WANT FRAMERS?

32:23.028 --> 32:26.016
	Lemonis:

32:23.028 --> 32:26.016
			AFTER MY VISIT TO MELITA'S,

32:26.017 --> 32:28.002
		I DECIDED TO SWING BY

32:26.017 --> 32:28.002
		TONNIE'S MINIS

32:28.003 --> 32:30.001
		AND CHECK ON THE CONSTRUCTION.

32:30.002 --> 32:33.002
	WHAT HAPPENED TO, LIKE,

32:30.002 --> 32:33.002
		A LITTLE BIT OF WORK?

32:33.003 --> 32:36.019
Man: A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TURNED

32:33.003 --> 32:36.019
	INTO THE CEILING FALLING DOWN.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.026
		-Lemonis: HOLY [BLEEP]

32:36.020 --> 32:38.026
	-Man: AND IT FELL DOWN.

32:38.027 --> 32:41.000
		WE COME TO CUT SOME LIGHTS IN,

32:38.027 --> 32:41.000
			AND THE CEILING FALLS DOWN.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.001
		Lemonis: LITERALLY FELL DOWN?

32:42.002 --> 32:43.012
Man: I MEAN LITERALLY FELL DOWN.

32:43.013 --> 32:46.012
		Lemonis: WHEN MY GUYS STARTED

32:43.013 --> 32:46.012
	WORKING ON THE CEILING,

32:46.013 --> 32:47.028
		IT WASN'T SUSPENDED PROPERLY,

32:47.028 --> 32:49.019
			AND SO IT LITERALLY

32:47.028 --> 32:49.019
CAVED IN ON THEM,

32:49.020 --> 32:51.012
AND I HAD TO SPEND

32:49.020 --> 32:51.012
ANOTHER 30 GRAND.

32:54.009 --> 32:55.026
-TONNIE: Hello?

32:54.009 --> 32:55.026
-Lemonis: TONNIE?

32:55.027 --> 32:58.011
			-TONNIE: Speaking.

32:55.027 --> 32:58.011
			-Lemonis: HEY. IT'S MARCUS.

32:58.012 --> 32:59.027
			TONNIE: Marcus, how are you?

32:59.028 --> 33:03.010
	Lemonis: I'M DOWN AT THE STORE,

32:59.028 --> 33:03.010
AND THE CEILING CAVED IN.

33:03.011 --> 33:04.028
		TONNIE: The ceiling...

33:05.000 --> 33:07.012
			Lemonis: COLLAPSED.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.012
		THE CEILING COLLAPSED.

33:07.013 --> 33:08.026
			LITERALLY COLLAPSED.

33:08.027 --> 33:11.006
			-TONNIE: The entire ceiling?

33:08.027 --> 33:11.006
		-Lemonis: THE ENTIRE CEILING.

33:11.007 --> 33:12.018
			TONNIE: Okay. I'm on my way.

33:12.019 --> 33:14.009
		Lemonis: OKAY.

33:16.009 --> 33:18.020
		IF YOUR BUSINESS IS IN TROUBLE

33:16.009 --> 33:18.020
		AND YOU NEED MY HELP,

33:18.021 --> 33:20.007
			LOG ON TO...

33:26.019 --> 33:29.000
-Man: HOW ARE YOU?

33:26.019 --> 33:29.000
			-Tonnie: HEY, GUYS.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.013
		-Lemonis: HI.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.013
			-Tamika: HI.

33:30.015 --> 33:33.013
			Lemonis: DID TONNIE TELL YOU

33:30.015 --> 33:33.013
		WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CEILING?

33:33.015 --> 33:35.028
-Tamika: IT FELL.

33:33.015 --> 33:35.028
-Lemonis: COLLAPSED. COMPLETELY.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.013
		CRAZY.

33:38.015 --> 33:39.028
			AFTER THE CEILING COLLAPSED,

33:39.028 --> 33:42.009
I HAD TO BRING IN

33:39.028 --> 33:42.009
			EXTRA WORKERS AND MATERIALS,

33:42.010 --> 33:46.007
		AND IT'S GONNA COST ME

33:42.010 --> 33:46.007
AN EXTRA $30,000.

33:46.008 --> 33:48.001
	BUT I REALLY DON'T HAVE

33:46.008 --> 33:48.001
A CHOICE.

33:48.002 --> 33:50.000
IN ORDER FOR THIS BUSINESS

33:48.002 --> 33:50.000
	TO WORK,

33:50.000 --> 33:51.019
	THE SPACE HAS TO BE FUNCTIONAL.

33:51.020 --> 33:53.026
Erenisse: OH, HI.

33:53.027 --> 33:56.016
	Lemonis: I'M REALLY GLAD

33:53.027 --> 33:56.016
		THAT ERENISSE IS HERE,

33:56.017 --> 33:58.028
		BECAUSE I WANT HER TO SEE WHAT

33:56.017 --> 33:58.028
		KIND OF PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING,

33:58.028 --> 34:01.011
		ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE'S

33:58.028 --> 34:01.011
TONNIE'S LARGEST INVESTOR.

34:01.012 --> 34:03.009
		Tonnie: YOU KNOW ABOUT

34:01.012 --> 34:03.009
	THE CEILING COLLAPSING,

34:03.009 --> 34:05.007
SO AS YOU CAN SEE,

34:03.009 --> 34:05.007
			THERE'S A WHOLE NEW CEILING.

34:05.008 --> 34:07.021
	SO, YOU'RE STANDING ON THE SIDE

34:05.008 --> 34:07.021
	WHERE THE CUSTOMERS WILL STAND.

34:07.022 --> 34:11.003
IT'S BEING SET UP

34:07.022 --> 34:11.003
		SO THAT YOU HAVE YOUR CUPCAKE,

34:11.003 --> 34:14.014
YOUR ICING, YOUR TOPPING.

34:14.014 --> 34:17.014
		AND THAT CORNER THERE

34:14.014 --> 34:17.014
			WHERE THE STOVES USED TO BE

34:17.016 --> 34:19.003
IS AN ACTUAL DISPLAY CASE.

34:19.003 --> 34:21.018
Erenisse:

34:19.003 --> 34:21.018
		BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

34:21.021 --> 34:25.007
		SO, ALL OF THIS IS BEING DONE.

34:21.021 --> 34:25.007
			ALL THIS WORK IS BEING DONE.

34:25.009 --> 34:30.009
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING TO

34:25.009 --> 34:30.009
	BRING IN CUSTOMERS, SOME MONEY?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.009
-Tonnie: I HAVE THINGS LINED UP.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.009
-Erenisse: LIKE WHAT?

34:36.010 --> 34:41.003
WE'LL HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL STORE,

34:36.010 --> 34:41.003
		AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA BRING?

34:41.003 --> 34:42.009
		Tonnie: GREAT PRODUCT.

34:42.010 --> 34:43.018
	THE BEST-TASTING PRODUCT

34:42.010 --> 34:43.018
		WE CAN BRING.

34:43.018 --> 34:45.016
	Erenisse: BUT IF PEOPLE

34:43.018 --> 34:45.016
			DON'T KNOW WE'RE OUT THERE,

34:45.018 --> 34:46.027
	HOW'S THAT GONNA HAPPEN?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.007
Tonnie: SO, THE MARKETING TEAM'S

34:47.000 --> 34:48.007
			GONNA BE PULLED TOGETHER.

34:48.007 --> 34:49.010
	Erenisse: I WANT TO KNOW

34:48.007 --> 34:49.010
			WHEN THE MONEY'S COMING IN.

34:49.012 --> 34:50.023
			THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

34:54.023 --> 34:56.021
	YOU NEED TO GIVE

34:54.023 --> 34:56.021
		SOME THOUGHT TO THAT.

34:56.021 --> 34:57.025
		Tonnie: OKAY.

34:57.025 --> 35:00.016
Erenisse: BECAUSE AT THIS POINT,

34:57.025 --> 35:00.016
WE'RE MAXED OUT.

35:00.016 --> 35:05.007
	Lemonis:

35:00.016 --> 35:05.007
			SO, I'LL GIVE YOU THE PLAN.

35:05.007 --> 35:06.012
Tonnie: I APPRECIATE THAT.

35:06.014 --> 35:08.001
	Lemonis: WE'RE ABOUT THREE DAYS

35:08.003 --> 35:09.014
			FROM THE GRAND OPENING HERE,

35:09.016 --> 35:11.012
AND WE CAN INVITE

35:09.016 --> 35:11.012
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

35:11.014 --> 35:14.001
	BUT I KNOW RIGHT NOW I CAN TELL

35:11.014 --> 35:14.001
	YOU'RE A LITTLE ANNOYED,

35:14.003 --> 35:15.018
		SO I'M JUST ASKING YOU

35:14.003 --> 35:15.018
			JUST TO BE PATIENT.

35:15.018 --> 35:18.007
	Erenisse: I AM ANNOYED,

35:15.018 --> 35:18.007
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

35:18.007 --> 35:21.012
	-MAYBE IT'S MY WAY OF THINKING.

35:18.007 --> 35:21.012
	-Lemonis: NO, NO.

35:21.012 --> 35:23.025
		Erenisse: HE ALWAYS TELLS ME,

35:21.012 --> 35:23.025
		"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:23.027 --> 35:24.028
		I'M A BUSINESSPERSON."

35:25.000 --> 35:26.019
			Lemonis: NO, NO, NO.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.019
	YOU UNDERSTAND.

35:26.021 --> 35:29.005
	WE'RE JUST NOT AS READY

35:26.021 --> 35:29.005
AS WE WANT TO BE.

35:29.005 --> 35:30.018
	AND SO WE WILL BE READY.

35:30.019 --> 35:32.023
		JUST GIVE US A FEW MORE DAYS,

35:30.019 --> 35:32.023
ALL RIGHT?

35:32.025 --> 35:34.012
Erenisse: YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

35:32.025 --> 35:34.012
THANK YOU.

35:34.012 --> 35:36.027
Lemonis: I THINK ERENISSE

35:34.012 --> 35:36.027
IS SO TIRED ABOUT HEARING

35:36.027 --> 35:39.005
		HOW GREAT THINGS ARE GONNA BE

35:36.027 --> 35:39.005
		IN THE FUTURE,

35:39.005 --> 35:42.007
	AND SHE'S $250,000 IN THE HOLE,

35:42.009 --> 35:44.012
			AND SHE WANTS TO BE ASSURED

35:42.009 --> 35:44.012
			THAT TONNIE'S DOING

35:44.014 --> 35:46.014
	EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER

35:44.014 --> 35:46.014
			TO BRING IN REVENUE,

35:46.014 --> 35:48.025
		WHETHER THAT'S STANDING BEHIND

35:46.014 --> 35:48.025
	THE COUNTER AND SELLING

35:48.027 --> 35:50.023
		OR GENERATING

35:48.027 --> 35:50.023
	NEW WHOLESALE BUSINESS.

35:50.025 --> 35:52.016
	ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

35:50.025 --> 35:52.016
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

35:52.018 --> 35:53.023
	-Tonnie: OKAY.

35:52.018 --> 35:53.023
	-Tamika: OKAY, MARCUS.

35:53.023 --> 35:55.016
		-Lemonis: GOODBYE.

35:53.023 --> 35:55.016
		-Erenisse: ALL RIGHT.

36:00.003 --> 36:02.000
	Lemonis: LOOK AT

36:00.003 --> 36:02.000
			ALL THESE PEOPLE. IT'S BUSY.

36:02.001 --> 36:05.025
			NOW THAT TONNIE IS DEVOTING

36:02.001 --> 36:05.025
100% OF HIS TIME TO SALES,

36:05.025 --> 36:07.012
		I'VE SET UP A MEETING

36:05.025 --> 36:07.012
			AT SYLVIA'S

36:07.012 --> 36:09.010
			TO SEE WHAT KIND OF SALESMAN

36:07.012 --> 36:09.010
		HE REALLY IS.

36:09.010 --> 36:10.016
			TREN'NESS, NICE TO MEET YOU.

36:10.016 --> 36:12.001
-Tren'ness: WELCOME TO SYLVIA'S.

36:10.016 --> 36:12.001
-Lemonis: THANK YOU.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.007
			SYLVIA'S IS ONE OF THE MOST

36:12.003 --> 36:15.007
		POPULAR SOUL FOOD RESTAURANTS

36:15.009 --> 36:16.012
IN ALL OF AMERICA,

36:16.012 --> 36:18.019
AND HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY

36:16.012 --> 36:18.019
	TO SELL TO THEM

36:18.021 --> 36:19.025
			WOULD BE BIG MARGIN,

36:19.027 --> 36:22.010
	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME

36:19.027 --> 36:22.010
			WITH RENT OR LABOR.

36:22.012 --> 36:25.019
IT'S ESTABLISHING A RELATIONSHIP

36:22.012 --> 36:25.019
			AND FULFILLING IT.

36:25.021 --> 36:27.027
AND SO YOU'VE BEEN AROUND

36:25.021 --> 36:27.027
	THIS PLACE FOR HOW LONG?

36:27.027 --> 36:31.003
	Bedelia:

36:27.027 --> 36:31.003
			THE BUSINESS IS GONNA BE 53.

36:31.005 --> 36:32.021
		Lemonis: WOW.

36:32.021 --> 36:34.014
	Bedelia: SO DO THE MATH.

36:34.016 --> 36:36.001
		[ LAUGHTER ]

36:34.016 --> 36:36.001
Lemonis: I'M NOT DOING THE MATH.

36:36.003 --> 36:38.005
	I'M WITH A LADY,

36:36.003 --> 36:38.005
			AND I'M A GENTLEMAN.

36:38.007 --> 36:40.007
			Tonnie: I WANT TO THANK YOU

36:38.007 --> 36:40.007
	FOR TAKING THE TIME, OBVIOUSLY.

36:40.009 --> 36:41.014
		Tren'ness: OF COURSE.

36:41.014 --> 36:42.027
	Tonnie:

36:41.014 --> 36:42.027
I WANT TO COME TO HARLEM.

36:42.027 --> 36:44.005
		Tren'ness: ALL RIGHT.

36:44.005 --> 36:46.001
	Tonnie:

36:44.005 --> 36:46.001
HOW FANTASTIC WOULD IT BE

36:46.003 --> 36:48.012
			IF WE COULD IDENTIFY

36:46.003 --> 36:48.012
	ONE OR TWO ITEMS

36:48.014 --> 36:51.027
			THAT WE CAN DISPLAY AND SELL

36:48.014 --> 36:51.027
			ON YOUR COUNTERTOP?

36:51.028 --> 36:54.018
	THIS IS ACTUALLY

36:51.028 --> 36:54.018
	A SWEET POTATO CUPCAKE,

36:54.019 --> 36:56.018
	WHICH I BELIEVE YOU DON'T HAVE.

36:56.018 --> 36:58.016
		Bedelia: THAT'S RIGHT.

36:56.018 --> 36:58.016
		WE DON'T HAVE.

36:58.016 --> 37:00.007
			Lemonis: BUT I THINK THERE'S

36:58.016 --> 37:00.007
	A GOOD DEAL HERE FOR ALL OF US,

37:00.009 --> 37:02.025
			BECAUSE YOUR MARGINS

37:00.009 --> 37:02.025
		ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS

37:02.027 --> 37:04.007
			WILL BE REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

37:04.009 --> 37:06.021
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SELL

37:04.009 --> 37:06.021
			A SLICE OF CAKE FOR.

37:06.023 --> 37:09.001
		-Bedelia: $5.50.

37:06.023 --> 37:09.001
		-Tren'ness: YEAH, $5.50, $6.

37:09.003 --> 37:11.019
		Lemonis: AND SO THIS MAY ALLOW

37:09.003 --> 37:11.019
		FOR A LITTLE LOWER PRICE POINT

37:11.021 --> 37:12.027
		BUT THE SAME KIND OF MARGINS.

37:12.028 --> 37:14.023
		Tren'ness: HERE'S THE THING --

37:14.023 --> 37:18.000
			I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS

37:14.023 --> 37:18.000
		ABOUT BRINGING THEM IN-HOUSE.

37:19.007 --> 37:22.003
			WE'RE WORKING ON QUITE A FEW

37:22.005 --> 37:25.003
DIFFERENT

37:22.005 --> 37:25.003
			BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT ITEMS,

37:25.005 --> 37:27.023
			AND WE'RE ALREADY STRUGGLING

37:27.025 --> 37:31.021
	TRYING TO HOUSE

37:27.025 --> 37:31.021
	THE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE.

37:33.023 --> 37:36.027
			I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT

37:33.023 --> 37:36.027
		WE WOULD HAVE SPACE FOR THESE.

37:43.005 --> 37:43.021
 Tren'ness: HERE'S THE THING --

37:44.028 --> 37:47.007
	WE'RE ALREADY STRUGGLING

37:47.009 --> 37:50.007
	TRYING TO HOUSE

37:47.009 --> 37:50.007
	THE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE.

37:50.009 --> 37:53.023
			I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT

37:50.009 --> 37:53.023
		WE WOULD HAVE SPACE FOR THESE.

37:55.023 --> 38:02.012
BUT JUST FROM OUR CUSTOMER

37:55.023 --> 38:02.012
	STANDPOINT, THEY DICTATE, SO...

38:02.012 --> 38:04.003
Lemonis: HOW ABOUT

38:02.012 --> 38:04.003
			YOU AND I TAKE THEM AROUND?

38:04.005 --> 38:06.005
	CAN WE DO THAT?

38:04.005 --> 38:06.005
	CAN WE GIVE A FEW AWAY?

38:06.007 --> 38:09.000
		Tren'ness: OF COURSE.

38:06.007 --> 38:09.000
OF COURSE.

38:09.001 --> 38:11.019
			Lemonis: EVEN THOUGH

38:09.001 --> 38:11.019
			SYLVIA'S INITIALLY ACTS LIKE

38:11.021 --> 38:13.023
	THEY'RE NOT OPEN

38:11.021 --> 38:13.023
TO TAKING ON THIS PRODUCT,

38:13.023 --> 38:15.018
		THE FACT THAT

38:13.023 --> 38:15.018
	THEY LET US PASS IT OUT

38:15.018 --> 38:17.019
TO SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS

38:15.018 --> 38:17.019
	AND GET FEEDBACK

38:17.021 --> 38:18.027
TELLS ME THAT THEY MAY BE

38:18.027 --> 38:20.021
A LITTLE MORE OPEN

38:18.027 --> 38:20.021
	THAN THEY THINK.

38:20.023 --> 38:22.001
		Tonnie: CAN WE OFFER YOU GUYS

38:22.003 --> 38:23.025
	A COMPLIMENTARY CUPCAKE

38:22.003 --> 38:23.025
		ON THE HOUSE?

38:23.025 --> 38:26.023
		Lemonis: AT A RESTAURANT AS

38:23.025 --> 38:26.023
POPULAR AND AS BUSY AS SYLVIA'S,

38:26.023 --> 38:30.009
			THIS ACCOUNT COULD GENERATE

38:26.023 --> 38:30.009
			ABOUT $2,000 A DAY.

38:30.010 --> 38:31.023
		AND WHAT'S EVEN BETTER

38:31.023 --> 38:34.016
			IS THAT $1,600 OF IT

38:31.023 --> 38:34.016
		WOULD BE PURE PROFIT.

38:34.016 --> 38:35.023
	Tren'ness: HOW'D Y'ALL LIKE IT?

38:35.025 --> 38:37.023
			-Woman: IT'S GREAT.

38:35.025 --> 38:37.023
			-Tren'ness: OH, GOOD, GOOD.

38:37.023 --> 38:40.014
			SO, GREAT FEEDBACK.

38:40.016 --> 38:42.018
		YEAH, THIS IS SOME GOOD STUFF.

38:42.018 --> 38:44.028
Tonnie: YOU KNOW,

38:42.018 --> 38:44.028
		ONE OF THE THINGS, OF COURSE,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.001
		IS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

38:45.000 --> 38:47.001
TO PRODUCE AN ITEM

38:47.003 --> 38:49.007
THAT'S GONNA BE EXCLUSIVE

38:47.003 --> 38:49.007
			TO SYLVIA'S.

38:49.009 --> 38:51.019
	Tren'ness: HMM.

38:49.009 --> 38:51.019
	WELL, WE LIKE EXCLUSIVE.

38:51.021 --> 38:53.021
		Tonnie: THIS WOULD BE

38:51.021 --> 38:53.021
	JUST HERE FOR YOU GUYS.

38:53.021 --> 38:55.016
	-Bedelia: I'M SOLD.

38:53.021 --> 38:55.016
	-Tren'ness: [ LAUGHS ]

38:55.016 --> 38:57.023
		I SEE THIS ABSOLUTELY WORKING.

38:57.023 --> 39:02.018
	Lemonis: THE FACT THAT TONNIE

38:57.023 --> 39:02.018
WAS ABLE TO TURN A NO INTO A YES

39:02.019 --> 39:05.005
			IS PROOF TO ME THAT

39:02.019 --> 39:05.005
			I INVESTED IN THE RIGHT GUY.

39:05.007 --> 39:07.021
HE DID A GREAT JOB

39:05.007 --> 39:07.021
		IN THIS PRESENTATION.

39:07.023 --> 39:09.000
		WELL?

39:09.001 --> 39:10.012
	Tonnie: THAT WAS GREAT.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.025
	Lemonis: YOU DID GREAT.

39:11.025 --> 39:14.007
	WHEN YOU START TO FOLLOW

39:11.025 --> 39:14.007
			THE PROCESS,

39:14.009 --> 39:15.018
			THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

39:15.018 --> 39:16.025
		-Tonnie: OKAY.

Tamika: WOULD YOU LIKE A SAMPLE?

39:28.012 --> 39:30.016
	Tonnie: WOULD YOU LIKE A SAMPLE

39:28.012 --> 39:30.016
			FROM TONNIE'S MINIS?

39:30.016 --> 39:31.012
		GRAND OPENING.

39:44.025 --> 39:47.005

39:47.007 --> 39:50.016
	Lemonis: THE SCAFFOLDING

39:47.007 --> 39:50.016
			OUTSIDE IS NOW GONE,

39:50.016 --> 39:52.025
	SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE

39:58.014 --> 40:00.003
	SO IT'S BRIGHT AND OPEN.

40:00.005 --> 40:03.012
BEFORE, IT WAS DARK AND CRAMPED.

40:03.012 --> 40:05.007
			NOW IT HAS AN EFFICIENT FLOW

40:05.009 --> 40:07.010
FOR THE EMPLOYEES

40:34.014 --> 40:36.009
Woman: GONNA DO HALF CREAM

40:34.014 --> 40:36.009
			CHEESE AND HALF STRAWBERRY.

40:36.010 --> 40:37.023
		Lemonis: OH, SEE, NOW

40:36.010 --> 40:37.023
		YOU'RE MIXING IT UP A LITTLE.

			Lemonis: WE FINALLY LAUNCHED

40:39.003 --> 40:40.025
			THE DO-IT-YOURSELF.

40:40.025 --> 40:43.018
	THE SIGNAGE IS NOW CLEAR

40:40.025 --> 40:43.018
			AND UNDERSTANDABLE.

40:43.019 --> 40:44.028
	THE TOPPINGS BAR

40:45.000 --> 40:48.018
			IS EASY FOR KIDS AND ADULTS

40:45.000 --> 40:48.018
		TO SEE AND PICK FROM.

40:53.019 --> 40:55.027
	Lemonis:

40:53.019 --> 40:55.027
	I AM PART OF THE FAMILY.

40:55.028 --> 40:58.025
	THE BEST PART WAS SEEING TONNIE

40:55.028 --> 40:58.025
PAY HIS MOM BACK.

40:58.025 --> 41:00.023
			Tonnie: AS YOU KNOW,

40:58.025 --> 41:00.023
	OVER THE YEARS,

41:00.025 --> 41:03.003
			YOU'VE BEEN AN AMAZING PART

41:00.025 --> 41:03.003
	OF THE BUSINESS,

41:03.005 --> 41:04.012
	NEVER MIND BEING MY MOM.

41:04.012 --> 41:06.027
			AND FINALLY

41:04.012 --> 41:06.027
I'M ABLE TO PAY YOU BACK.

41:12.021 --> 41:13.010
	Tonnie's Mom: LOVE YOU.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.016
		Tonnie: LOVE YOU, TOO.

41:14.018 --> 41:16.007
		Lemonis: THE FACT THAT

41:14.018 --> 41:16.007
		HE'S PAID HIS MOM BACK

41:16.009 --> 41:17.018
			IS A BIG DEAL TO ME,

41:17.018 --> 41:20.010
		BUT WHAT'S EVEN BETTER

41:17.018 --> 41:20.010
			IS THAT HE NOW KNOWS

41:20.012 --> 41:22.003
		THAT ERENISSE'S MONEY IS SAFE

41:22.003 --> 41:24.016
	AND IT'S HEADED

41:22.003 --> 41:24.016
	IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
