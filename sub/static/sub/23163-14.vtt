00:00.001 --> 00:02.377
These survivalist trips
can get pretty tough, Higgins.

00:02.438 --> 00:04.235
Just because
they're at the prison farm

00:04.271 --> 00:06.239
doesn't make them
hardened criminals, Magnum.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.744
Higgins, please answer.
You're in big trouble. Higgins!

00:11.812 --> 00:12.972
Doug, shoot!

00:15.116 --> 00:17.016
Look, we can't leave
Higgins here alive.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.785
Higgins!

00:19.854 --> 00:21.219
Thomas!

00:25.593 --> 00:26.719
Shoot him!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.457
Shoot him,
Clint! Shoot!

02:19.773 --> 02:23.607
<i>I had become separated from
my unit during a skirmish,</i>

02:23.844 --> 02:26.813
<i>and I had spent nine days
alone in the jungle,</i>

02:26.881 --> 02:31.250
<i>sustaining myself on the small
creatures that I was able to entrap...</i>

02:33.954 --> 02:38.414
<i>ever mindful of the fact that I
was the hunted, as well as the hunter.</i>

02:41.795 --> 02:43.319
<i>On this particular morning,</i>

02:43.397 --> 02:46.560
<i>my predators had moved to
within a few yards of my camp.</i>

02:46.634 --> 02:49.831
<i>And I knew that an unfortunate
member of the enemy patrol</i>

02:49.904 --> 02:52.964
<i>had tripped one of my many
spring-trap devices.</i>

03:02.950 --> 03:05.180
<i>As they moved ever closer to me,</i>

03:05.252 --> 03:07.652
<i>I plotted my last attempt
at survival,</i>

03:07.721 --> 03:10.986
<i>knowing that cunning rarely
prevails over firepower.</i>

03:35.216 --> 03:38.276
<i>Fortunately, I was not
wounded seriously, and...</i>

03:38.352 --> 03:40.149
<i>And you overpowered
the patrol leader,</i>

03:40.221 --> 03:43.213
held the three men captive until
Allied forces took the area.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.193
<i>I'm sorry, Higgins.
I really have to run,</i>

03:47.261 --> 03:49.195
and I really didn't
want to miss that story.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.493
<i>You guys enjoy your trip. When
did you say you were due back, Del?</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:54.329
It's usually late
Monday morning.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.063
Usually?

03:56.203 --> 03:59.001
That means you've had to
come back earlier sometimes?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.506
Of course not.
Why wouldn't he?

04:00.574 --> 04:04.408
<i>Well, these survivalist trips can get
pretty tough, Higgins, even for kids.</i>

04:04.478 --> 04:07.379
No problem there. These guys
are pretty tough themselves.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.442
<i>Well, I kind of presumed they were,
considering their present address.</i>

04:11.552 --> 04:13.452
Just because
they're at the prison farm

04:13.520 --> 04:15.647
<i>doesn't make them
hardened criminals, Magnum.</i>

04:15.723 --> 04:19.351
Mr. Haynes has certainly counseled the
boys long enough to know the best ones.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.394
<i>Higgins, I think
it's a good program.</i>

04:21.462 --> 04:23.692
<i>I think it's great that you're
volunteering to go along,</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:25.425
and don't worry
about anything here.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.467
<i>I mean, I couldn't even
get in touch with you</i>

04:27.534 --> 04:29.024
if there was an emergency here.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.469
So I guess you'll just have
to trust me to handle things.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.098
<i>Well, if it were a real
emergency, you could reach us.</i>

04:34.174 --> 04:35.698
I always take a shortwave along.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.471
You do?

04:38.345 --> 04:42.076
That means that you could get
off the island earlier if...

04:42.149 --> 04:43.810
<i>Magnum, what is going on?</i>

04:43.884 --> 04:44.873
Going on?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.044
This obsession
with my itinerary.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.850
Is something happening this
weekend of which I'm unaware?

04:49.223 --> 04:50.952
<i>Well, I'm not sure.</i>

04:51.392 --> 04:55.658
<i>Look, Higgins, when was the last
time you were in a survival situation?</i>

04:56.630 --> 04:57.892
I see.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.298
You're suggesting that I may no longer
be capable of such strenuous activity?

05:01.368 --> 05:04.997
I'm suggesting that anybody
can forget how tough it is

05:05.072 --> 05:08.064
and maybe even forget
a few of the techniques.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.038
I haven't forgotten anything!

05:10.110 --> 05:12.044
Where in God's name is my knife?

05:12.112 --> 05:15.172
<i>Your knife? This knife? Is this
what you're looking for, Higgins?</i>

05:15.249 --> 05:16.978
<i>You know, you had this
with you the other day</i>

05:17.051 --> 05:18.313
<i>when you came to tell me
about the trip,</i>

05:18.385 --> 05:19.613
but you left it on the mantle.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.552
I guess you forgot it!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.549
The shortwave call letters?

05:26.894 --> 05:27.883
N-6...

05:27.961 --> 05:29.053
<i>Del, please!</i>

05:29.129 --> 05:30.494
<i>Mr. Higgins,
it's getting late,</i>

05:30.564 --> 05:32.532
and we still have to
go get the boys.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.332
N-6-D-V-Z.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.405
Call only in the event
of a global war.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.065
<i>Oh, I'll wait for you to call</i>

05:41.141 --> 05:44.872
in the event that you're hurt
or sick or just overly tired.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.684
It's on.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.319
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

05:58.392 --> 06:02.192
Nothing is gonna get Higgins
back here before Monday. Nothing.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.375
<i>You learn very quickly, Moki.</i>

06:15.442 --> 06:17.876
I've done this before.
My dad showed me how.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.469
He's an avid survivalist?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.544
<i>Well, yeah, sort of.</i>

06:25.419 --> 06:27.887
<i>You need help with
the thatching, Clint?</i>

06:27.955 --> 06:29.320
All I need is something to eat!

06:29.390 --> 06:31.915
I still don't see why we
didn't bring some food along.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.084
Because the purpose of the trip

06:33.160 --> 06:35.094
is to take what we need
from the environment.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.255
Self-reliance
breeds self-esteem.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.824
<i>Well said, Mr. Higgins.</i>

06:38.899 --> 06:42.130
Right. You guys can learn
a lot from Mr. Higgins.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.660
<i>You know, he once survived
alone in the jungle for nine days</i>

06:45.739 --> 06:47.536
and then captured
an enemy patrol?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.769
No kidding! VCs?

06:50.277 --> 06:53.838
<i>What? Oh, no, they were Japanese
soldiers. The Second World War.</i>

07:00.387 --> 07:02.514
<i>I'll go get some firewood,
Mr. Haynes.</i>

07:02.589 --> 07:05.387
<i>You're to be commended
for your initiative, Doug.</i>

07:05.459 --> 07:06.949
<i>Oh, he's got the jump on us.</i>

07:07.027 --> 07:09.120
He's made one of
these trips before.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.539
<i>Firearms on the trip,
Mr. Haynes?</i>

07:30.217 --> 07:32.651
I thought these boys
had your complete trust.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.719
<i>Oh, they do. I just bring this
along in case we can't trap any food.</i>

07:36.790 --> 07:38.781
It's just a rabbit rifle.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.131
<i>You don't, by any chance...</i>

07:50.304 --> 07:54.741
I mean... I seem to have lost
Irene McDonald's phone number.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.299
<i>You don't happen
to have it, do you?</i>

07:59.379 --> 08:03.509
<i>Well, I know she told you not to
give it to me, but that was years ago.</i>

08:03.951 --> 08:05.009
<i>I mean,</i>

08:05.085 --> 08:06.518
<i>she was a little angry
at the moment,</i>

08:06.587 --> 08:08.748
but I'm sure
that's water under the bridge.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.683
<i>Oh, now wait!
Russell, wait.</i>

08:13.393 --> 08:16.590
<i>You know, I promised you
never to tell what happened</i>

08:16.663 --> 08:19.154
<i>at the Founder's Day picnic
in '82, didn't I?</i>

08:19.500 --> 08:22.435
<i>No, I never said
that I changed my mind,</i>

08:23.804 --> 08:26.136
but if I had
that phone number...

08:26.707 --> 08:27.799
Yeah.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.871
I got it. Thanks.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.179
<i>Hi, this is...</i>

08:45.526 --> 08:47.517
This is Irene's machine.

09:11.919 --> 09:12.977
Hi.

09:14.488 --> 09:15.716
It's me.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.922
How would you like to
let bygones be bygones?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.526
<i>Well, I was giving
a little party</i>

09:26.600 --> 09:28.761
<i>for some old friends, and...</i>

09:29.436 --> 09:31.097
Do you think maybe

09:31.405 --> 09:34.101
you'd like to be
in that category again?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.709
<i>Give me a call back, okay?</i>

09:46.019 --> 09:48.715
<i>MOKl: Where'd you learn about this
monkey vine thing, Mr. Higgins?</i>

09:48.789 --> 09:51.280
In the Fiji Islands.
Some years ago

09:51.892 --> 09:54.156
I happened to see an old man trolling the sea

09:54.227 --> 09:56.752
with one long strand
of monkey vine.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.560
<i>To my amazement, a fish followed
the vine to the water's edge,</i>

10:01.635 --> 10:03.262
where the old man speared it.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.430
He explained to me
that certain marine species

10:05.505 --> 10:08.269
are irresistibly attracted
to the monkey vine.

10:08.342 --> 10:12.472
<i>Later I decided that a net made of
the vine would prove more practical,</i>

10:12.546 --> 10:14.878
and my theory
was indeed correct.

10:15.682 --> 10:18.150
<i>Oh, well,
I learned it from my dad.</i>

10:18.218 --> 10:19.947
He saw it in an old movie.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.749
<i>Really? Well,</i>

10:22.322 --> 10:25.985
<i>if you'll catch on to the
safety line, Moki, I'll cast out.</i>

10:29.730 --> 10:33.188
<i>Odd, I don't remember my
other nets being this heavy.</i>

10:33.800 --> 10:35.768
Maybe we put
too many rocks on it.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.704
<i>No, no, no, I'm... I'm sure
the net is weighted properly.</i>

10:41.475 --> 10:42.942
I can manage.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.129
Mr. Higgins!

11:04.865 --> 11:06.264
Mr. Higgins!

11:06.967 --> 11:08.457
Are you okay?

11:10.570 --> 11:13.630
<i>I'm telling you, he's gonna wake
up and realize what's happening,</i>

11:13.707 --> 11:16.198
and he's gonna come
back here and kill us.

11:16.276 --> 11:20.440
<i>Besides, we don't even have
a reason for having a party.</i>

11:20.514 --> 11:23.415
No reason? When's the last time
Higgins went away for the weekend?

11:23.483 --> 11:25.576
<i>What's going on, Rick? I
thought you were all for this?</i>

11:25.652 --> 11:28.450
<i>Yeah, well, I was,
until I talked to Marge.</i>

11:28.522 --> 11:29.853
Marge?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.489
<i>Yeah, Marge.</i>

11:31.692 --> 11:34.160
<i>She hates big parties, Thomas.</i>

11:34.227 --> 11:35.990
You know what Marge means to me.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.191
<i>No. No, I don't. You only
met her two weeks ago.</i>

11:39.266 --> 11:41.234
Yo! Anybody around?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.970
What is all of this?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.904
<i>Hey, we're using the main house!
We're gonna need the space.</i>

11:46.973 --> 11:50.238
<i>Yeah, that's what I came
to talk to you about.</i>

11:50.577 --> 11:53.444
<i>You know, I think we ought
to reconsider this party idea.</i>

11:53.747 --> 11:56.545
Reconsider?
It's tomorrow!

11:57.384 --> 11:59.181
I don't understand.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.345
I thought you guys
really wanted to have it.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.879
<i>When's the last time we had a big,
all-day party with the old gang?</i>

12:04.958 --> 12:06.323
I don't remember.

12:06.393 --> 12:10.159
<i>That's the point. I mean,
maybe there is no old gang.</i>

12:10.230 --> 12:12.892
<i>I mean, maybe everybody's
busy these days</i>

12:12.966 --> 12:15.059
doing more important things
than partying.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.263
<i>We're all too busy.
I mean, that's the point.</i>

12:18.338 --> 12:21.102
<i>We've forgotten how to
relax, even for just a day.</i>

12:21.174 --> 12:23.768
<i>T. C., don't back out on me.
I got tons of people coming.</i>

12:23.844 --> 12:25.641
Tons? How many is that?

12:25.712 --> 12:27.373
Tons! Twelve.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.980
But I got nine maybes.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.087
<i>Yeah, and how many
turn-downs?</i>

12:34.988 --> 12:37.479
<i>Seventeen, twenty. What
difference does that make?</i>

12:37.557 --> 12:39.286
There's a lot of people
I haven't reached yet.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.589
We could have 50
by tomorrow morning.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.222
Sure.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.198
I'm for canceling.
I can still save a job.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.733
Save a job?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.863
Save a job?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.803
<i>That's all that really
matters anymore, isn't it?</i>

12:56.109 --> 12:58.737
<i>I mean, we're so mature
and responsible,</i>

12:58.812 --> 13:02.043
we can't do anything
that doesn't involve business.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.140
<i>I don't believe this.
I mean, you guys</i>

13:04.217 --> 13:07.812
<i>are always complaining about
having to work all of the time,</i>

13:07.888 --> 13:11.051
about never having a day
to just check out.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.457
So I come up with a whole day

13:14.528 --> 13:17.929
<i>where we don't have to do
anything but enjoy ourselves,</i>

13:18.298 --> 13:20.391
and you guys back out on me.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.739
<i>Okay, drinks and ice
at 10:00.</i>

13:31.411 --> 13:33.902
<i>I'll take care of Marge
and the food,</i>

13:33.980 --> 13:36.972
but you gotta take care of
Higgins when he sees this joint.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.881
Will you stop?
He's not coming back.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.476
<i>Yeah, Orville.</i>

13:40.554 --> 13:42.146
<i>After what Thomas told him,</i>

13:42.222 --> 13:44.782
Higgins would have to have
pneumonia and two broken legs

13:44.858 --> 13:47.850
before he'd even think
about coming back early.

13:55.902 --> 13:57.733
<i>Calling N-6-D-B-Z.</i>

13:57.804 --> 14:00.796
<i>Higgins? Higgins, come
on, I know you're there.</i>

14:00.874 --> 14:02.671
<i>Look, I don't want to push this,</i>

14:02.742 --> 14:05.768
<i>but I've set up Robin's shortwave
and I'm leaving it on all the time,</i>

14:05.846 --> 14:08.974
<i>just in case of global
war. Seriously, Higgins.</i>

14:15.689 --> 14:18.385
<i>Sorry, lads.
Where was I?</i>

14:18.692 --> 14:20.717
<i>Ah, yes, Abdul Ben Bashi.</i>

14:21.995 --> 14:25.658
<i>Well, being of the desert,
he had never tasted fish</i>

14:25.732 --> 14:28.826
and presumed that we had
cooked his pet iguanas.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.366
He ordered that we be stripped
and baked in the sun until dead.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.938
What happened?

14:35.008 --> 14:39.570
<i>Well, in deference to the modesty of
his wives, we asked not to be stripped.</i>

14:46.019 --> 14:48.510
<i>Yes, well, I'm sure you've heard
equally interesting anecdotes</i>

14:48.588 --> 14:50.283
about the war from your fathers.

14:50.357 --> 14:55.420
<i>Well, actually, Mr. Higgins, my
father was born after that war,</i>

14:55.829 --> 14:58.889
but I heard some great stories
about it from my grandfather.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.436
<i>How's your head,
Mr. Higgins?</i>

15:06.506 --> 15:07.905
What? Something wrong
with your head?

15:07.974 --> 15:09.407
<i>Well, he was
casting out a net and...</i>

15:09.476 --> 15:12.036
And slipped. I'm fine now.
It doesn't bear discussing.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.808
<i>Moki, didn't you tell me that
your father saw action in the war?</i>

15:14.881 --> 15:17.850
<i>Huh? Oh, yeah,
in lots of them!</i>

15:17.918 --> 15:19.852
He was an Airborne Ranger
in Nam.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.114
<i>Sure, Moki.</i>

15:21.187 --> 15:25.453
<i>He was! And when I get out, he's gonna
take me to all the places he fought.</i>

15:26.393 --> 15:29.021
<i>Yeah, if they ever let him out.</i>

15:30.196 --> 15:33.563
<i>Hey, that's enough! That's
enough! Now knock it off!</i>

15:35.335 --> 15:36.893
<i>Clint, go get some firewood.</i>

15:50.083 --> 15:52.984
<i>Perhaps we should go
collect some as well, Moki.</i>

16:11.171 --> 16:14.971
But it's true. My dad is a
hero. He got a medal and...

16:15.041 --> 16:19.740
<i>Moki, I believe you, but I think
it best that we forget the incident.</i>

16:21.514 --> 16:24.312
<i>And, if you don't mind,</i>

16:24.384 --> 16:28.252
we might keep the fishing
incident just between us as well.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.353
Doug!

16:38.164 --> 16:39.188
What?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.326
I had to do it!

16:43.837 --> 16:45.031
Let's get out of here!

16:46.806 --> 16:48.296
Mr. Haynes...

16:48.575 --> 16:49.803
What...

17:14.817 --> 17:16.409
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

17:16.484 --> 17:18.316
<i>But this time you're wrong.</i>

17:18.387 --> 17:21.413
<i>Okay, maybe I had gone a
little too far with Higgins,</i>

17:21.490 --> 17:25.425
<i>pressing him to the point where I knew
he wouldn't come home unexpectedly,</i>

17:25.493 --> 17:28.657
<i>and ruin what promised to be
a very enjoyable weekend bash.</i>

17:33.402 --> 17:38.101
<i>But sometimes with Higgins you have to
go too far just to make sure it takes.</i>

17:38.808 --> 17:43.211
<i>On the other hand, I was beginning
to detect just the slightest twinge</i>

17:43.279 --> 17:46.976
<i>of something that could be
interpreted as a touch of guilt,</i>

17:47.383 --> 17:51.342
<i>which was beginning to get in the way of
all the fun I was supposed to be having.</i>

17:52.922 --> 17:55.618
Sam. Thomas Magnum.

17:56.926 --> 17:59.952
<i>Yeah, it has been a while.
Listen, did you get my message?</i>

18:00.363 --> 18:02.297
Done! This is the last load.

18:02.531 --> 18:04.624
Really? Congratulations.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.332
<i>Thanks. Now, you mind
giving me a hand?</i>

18:08.404 --> 18:10.065
We're running out of time.

18:10.139 --> 18:13.040
<i>Of course I'm sorry
you can't make it, but...</i>

18:13.109 --> 18:15.577
<i>Yeah, give me a call,
Sam. Bye.</i>

18:17.580 --> 18:21.072
Sam Makini is finishing
his thesis this weekend.

18:21.150 --> 18:23.482
Did you know he's getting
a master's in physics?

18:23.552 --> 18:25.383
<i>Ah, that's terrific.</i>

18:32.862 --> 18:36.127
<i>I know we got less than an hour. Did
you set up the table in the living room?</i>

18:36.198 --> 18:37.893
<i>Yeah. I just hope
everybody's careful.</i>

18:37.967 --> 18:40.993
<i>Higgins will kill me if there
are food stains on the rug.</i>

18:41.070 --> 18:43.630
<i>I worked things out with
Marge. She's stopping by later.</i>

18:43.706 --> 18:45.503
<i>Good. We've got
too many guys.</i>

18:45.574 --> 18:46.973
<i>Have you seen Rita Clark lately?</i>

18:47.043 --> 18:48.101
<i>I can't seem to reach her.</i>

18:48.177 --> 18:52.079
<i>Forget it! Rita's got her real estate
license. Saturday's her big day.</i>

18:56.318 --> 18:57.785
What about Dana Prescott?

18:57.853 --> 18:59.514
I reached
her ex-landlady.

18:59.588 --> 19:02.284
Dana moved back to Portland
to pick up her teaching career.

19:02.358 --> 19:05.486
Okay. I've got a vanload full of liquids

19:06.762 --> 19:07.990
that I need some help with.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.964
I guess after that we're ready.

19:10.032 --> 19:11.056
You gotta be kidding.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.158
We've got a lot of work to
do here before the doors open.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.600
Before the doors open?

19:14.670 --> 19:16.399
<i>Rick, we're not having
a luncheon at the Club.</i>

19:16.472 --> 19:18.030
We're having a party
for old friends.

19:18.107 --> 19:20.268
<i>Thomas, it just so happens
that some of those old friends</i>

19:20.342 --> 19:21.366
<i>are charter members of the Club,</i>

19:21.444 --> 19:24.709
and I can't afford to give
them a sloppy food setup.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.487
MOKl: Where the hell
did that come from?

20:35.084 --> 20:36.449
You lead!

20:46.262 --> 20:47.957
<i>Al. Thomas.</i>

20:49.198 --> 20:50.688
Thomas Magnum.

20:52.234 --> 20:54.702
<i>Well, no, I didn't leave
my last name on the message.</i>

20:54.770 --> 20:57.068
I thought you'd know who it was.

20:57.273 --> 21:00.731
<i>You can? That's great.
Okay, I'll see you then.</i>

21:01.944 --> 21:04.276
Al Cleary is on his way over.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.870
<i>Al Cleary? Thomas,
don't you remember</i>

21:05.981 --> 21:07.278
what Al Cleary's like
at parties?

21:07.349 --> 21:10.614
<i>Yeah, he hits on every girl there
while balancing bottles on his nose.</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:13.280
<i>Well, we haven't seen him in a
long time. Maybe he's changed.</i>

21:13.355 --> 21:14.947
Everybody else has.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.652
<i>Besides, he puts us
over 20 guests.</i>

21:18.027 --> 21:20.495
<i>Oh, if it's just numbers
that we're after,</i>

21:20.563 --> 21:23.396
then there are some clients
I'd like to invite. Clients?

21:23.465 --> 21:26.366
<i>Yeah, cargo shippers,
travel agents...</i>

21:26.435 --> 21:29.802
<i>T. C., we agreed to take the
whole weekend off. No business!</i>

21:29.872 --> 21:32.432
<i>Yeah, but I didn't agree
not to think about business.</i>

21:33.309 --> 21:35.470
<i>You know, T. C.,
you got a point there.</i>

21:35.544 --> 21:37.910
I could invite
all my produce suppliers.

21:39.315 --> 21:43.183
<i>Guys, we're getting away from
the whole purpose of this.</i>

21:44.820 --> 21:48.415
Why? We can't relax and
save money at the same time?

21:48.490 --> 21:50.720
<i>I mean, a couple of clients
and all this food and drink</i>

21:50.793 --> 21:52.226
can become one big
tax write-off.

21:52.294 --> 21:54.762
No! We are having
20 old friends over!

21:55.998 --> 21:57.829
Twenty-one! Hello?

22:05.574 --> 22:06.768
Robin?

22:09.111 --> 22:11.636
<i>No, Higgins
isn't here. Why?</i>

22:11.714 --> 22:13.375
<i>Hello, Robin's Nest.</i>

22:13.449 --> 22:16.145
<i>Hey, Donna, yeah,
it's Rick! How you doing?</i>

22:16.218 --> 22:19.085
<i>Robin, Higgins said
that that was next Saturday.</i>

22:19.154 --> 22:21.179
<i>No, no, it's today!
Right now!</i>

22:21.257 --> 22:22.918
Didn't Thomas explain
that in his message?

22:22.992 --> 22:24.619
<i>Well, I guess I misunderstood.</i>

22:25.227 --> 22:27.320
I'm sure Higgins
has everything ready.

22:27.396 --> 22:29.864
We're about to start
right now! Are you coming?

22:29.932 --> 22:32.162
<i>That's terrific!
Okay, bye, Donna!</i>

22:32.234 --> 22:34.099
Right. Robin. Bye.

22:34.169 --> 22:37.036
<i>Hey, Donna Lee and her roommate
are coming. That makes 22!</i>

22:37.106 --> 22:39.165
Great! What did
Robin want?

22:39.241 --> 22:41.675
His house.
Our whole party's off.

22:43.045 --> 22:44.376
It's what?

22:45.080 --> 22:47.207
Calling N-6-D-B-Z.
Come in.

22:48.717 --> 22:50.708
<i>N-6-D-B-Z, come in.</i>

22:50.786 --> 22:53.254
<i>Higgins, please answer.
You're in big trouble.</i>

22:53.889 --> 22:55.186
<i>Higgins!</i>

22:56.592 --> 22:58.492
Higgins?
Come on.

22:59.028 --> 23:00.655
We don't want to kill you!

23:03.465 --> 23:05.899
We just want to
talk this thing out!

23:06.735 --> 23:08.635
<i>I'm sure he's gonna
believe you, Doug.</i>

23:08.704 --> 23:10.968
You think he doesn't know we've
been gunning for him all night?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.905
<i>Yeah, he's outsmarted us good.</i>

23:12.975 --> 23:15.944
All the traps and these
paths that lead to nowhere.

23:16.011 --> 23:17.842
Shut up!
Just drop it!

23:17.913 --> 23:21.610
No! We ought to stop looking
for him and find that damn raft!

23:21.684 --> 23:23.413
Forget the raft!
It's gone.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.577
<i>Now, somebody took it.</i>

23:24.653 --> 23:26.644
Are you sure you remember where you hid it?

23:26.722 --> 23:29.623
<i>I mean, it's been a month
since you've been here before.</i>

23:29.692 --> 23:31.819
<i>Yes, I'm sure.
It's gone.</i>

23:32.061 --> 23:35.292
<i>Look, we'll make another raft,</i>

23:35.364 --> 23:37.457
after we get Higgins.
Okay?

23:39.234 --> 23:41.964
Sure. Anybody here know
how to build one?

23:43.872 --> 23:45.271
Never mind.

23:45.574 --> 23:49.032
<i>Probably gonna starve
before we find him, anyway.</i>

23:49.511 --> 23:51.570
MOKl: We gotta
get back to camp!

23:51.814 --> 23:54.282
There's lots of roots
and stuff back there.

23:58.954 --> 24:00.319
<i>Doug, shoot!
Quick!</i>

24:05.427 --> 24:09.523
Great shooting! Give me that
thing! I can't do any worse!

24:23.112 --> 24:25.012
Let's go back to camp.

24:38.961 --> 24:40.451
<i>Higgins got it!</i>

24:40.529 --> 24:43.498
The net's gone! He's got the fishing net!

24:43.565 --> 24:46.932
<i>Well, keep searching! He couldn't
have dragged everything off!</i>

24:47.002 --> 24:48.299
Then who did?

24:48.370 --> 24:50.497
We can't make it
out here without food.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.005
We gotta start making a raft!

24:52.074 --> 24:54.975
<i>No! Look, we can't leave
Higgins here alive.</i>

24:55.911 --> 24:57.503
Me and Moki can.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.877
We didn't have nothing
to do with killing Haynes.

24:59.948 --> 25:02.178
You guys are in it
as much as me.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.185
You were both in on the escape!

25:04.253 --> 25:06.312
Maybe that's not how the cops'll look at it.

25:08.290 --> 25:09.882
You ready to find out?

25:12.961 --> 25:14.952
<i>Well, then come up with a plan!</i>

25:15.030 --> 25:17.624
Higgins could run us
around this island for days.

25:21.170 --> 25:22.728
Or he could make a mistake.

25:35.184 --> 25:36.981
<i>Damn, that smells good!</i>

25:37.052 --> 25:39.748
Keep your mind on business.
It's gotta be a trap.

25:39.822 --> 25:41.813
<i>If it is, it's a good one.</i>

26:05.781 --> 26:07.476
<i>Shoot him, Clint!</i>

26:07.549 --> 26:08.811
Shoot him!

26:08.884 --> 26:10.442
Shoot him!

26:24.252 --> 26:26.686
<i>Higgins?
Higgins, come in.</i>

26:28.603 --> 26:30.434
<i>Higgins, come on.
I know you're there.</i>

26:30.505 --> 26:32.336
He's not gonna answer.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.432
We're gonna have
to go over there.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.033
He's just being stubborn.

26:36.645 --> 26:37.634
Robin's Nest.

26:37.712 --> 26:39.703
<i>Calling N-6-D-B-Z.
Come in, please.</i>

26:39.781 --> 26:41.043
He's busy right now.

26:41.116 --> 26:44.517
<i>Higgins, this is no joke. Answer
the radio. It's for your own good.</i>

26:44.586 --> 26:46.019
<i>Oh, no.
He called that off.</i>

26:46.087 --> 26:49.545
Is anybody there? I need to
speak to Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

26:49.624 --> 26:51.683
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, but I
really can't interrupt him.</i>

26:51.760 --> 26:54.490
<i>N-6-D-B-Z. Anybody?
Come in, please.</i>

26:55.497 --> 26:56.691
<i>Okay, I'll tell him.</i>

26:56.765 --> 26:58.164
N-6-D-B-Z!

26:58.233 --> 26:59.632
L- R-E-N-E.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.032
Come in. I got it. Thanks.

27:01.102 --> 27:03.366
McDonald? Wait! Irene.

27:05.407 --> 27:06.533
She's not home.

27:06.608 --> 27:07.734
I'm gonna leave a message.

27:07.842 --> 27:10.902
She's on her way to Nairobi
on a scientific expedition.

27:10.979 --> 27:14.210
But she said that she might call
you when she gets back in two years.

27:14.582 --> 27:16.675
Let's go.
We'll take the chopper.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.157
<i>All right, Higgins,
this is your last chance.</i>

27:24.225 --> 27:25.658
<i>Where are you?</i>

27:25.727 --> 27:28.218
<i>I repeat, where are you?</i>

27:55.690 --> 27:57.317
<i>No, Moki, please.</i>

27:58.093 --> 27:59.617
It's all right.

28:01.629 --> 28:04.029
I thought I was in a tomb.

28:04.332 --> 28:06.459
A cave on the far side
of the island.

28:07.135 --> 28:09.262
You've been asleep
for several hours.

28:10.505 --> 28:11.995
I really hurt.

28:13.174 --> 28:14.698
Am I gonna be okay?

28:14.776 --> 28:18.177
<i>Yes, but you must
remain perfectly still.</i>

28:19.114 --> 28:20.308
Forever?

28:20.648 --> 28:22.115
<i>No, of course not.</i>

28:22.450 --> 28:27.046
It's just that you mustn't exert yourself
until we can get you to a hospital.

28:50.945 --> 28:52.276
Here.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.819
It seems that I owe you
a debt of gratitude.

29:03.291 --> 29:05.486
Why did you try to stop Doug?

29:06.294 --> 29:09.058
There wasn't supposed
to be any killing.

29:09.297 --> 29:10.696
<i>Mr. Haynes,</i>

29:11.800 --> 29:12.994
you,

29:13.735 --> 29:14.997
anybody.

29:15.303 --> 29:17.464
You planned an escape?

29:19.340 --> 29:22.901
<i>Doug and Clint, they wanted to go to Canada.</i>

29:24.078 --> 29:26.603
I just wanted to
get to San Diego

29:27.348 --> 29:28.975
to spring my dad.

29:29.450 --> 29:31.418
<i>Moki, if your father's
in prison...</i>

29:31.486 --> 29:32.851
No!

29:35.590 --> 29:37.182
He's in a VA ward.

29:40.161 --> 29:43.688
I got nine months for
springing him out of Pearl.

29:45.233 --> 29:48.498
He just wants to live out
in the jungle on his own.

29:49.737 --> 29:52.035
There's nothing wrong with that.

29:55.944 --> 29:57.275
Is there?

29:59.981 --> 30:01.949
<i>Your father will be fine, Moki.</i>

30:02.650 --> 30:04.777
Now you must get some rest.

30:06.354 --> 30:08.788
You'll be safe here
until I return.

30:14.262 --> 30:15.854
Where are you going?

30:16.030 --> 30:19.261
I presume Doug still has a
good supply of ammunition?

30:19.601 --> 30:22.434
<i>Four, five boxes.</i>

30:22.904 --> 30:24.394
I'm not sure.

30:24.472 --> 30:26.565
That's at least 250 rounds.

30:27.175 --> 30:30.770
I have to go and find him
again before he finds us.

30:57.372 --> 31:00.170
<i>You choked, man. You had the perfect shot.</i>

31:00.942 --> 31:03.911
<i>Come on, Doug. I've never
shot at anybody before.</i>

31:05.146 --> 31:07.376
<i>Yeah, well, you still haven't.</i>

31:08.583 --> 31:11.814
So how come I'm facing a
murder rap? Maybe two with Moki.

31:11.886 --> 31:13.478
And we're still after Higgins?

31:13.554 --> 31:15.852
How many people
are we gonna kill?

31:15.924 --> 31:18.051
You think I'm enjoying this?

31:19.193 --> 31:22.219
I didn't have any choice.
I had to kill Haynes.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.662
Why did you have to?

31:23.731 --> 31:25.699
<i>I mean, what happened, exactly?</i>

31:25.767 --> 31:27.928
<i>I wasn't there, remember?</i>

31:34.208 --> 31:35.607
Come on.

31:41.582 --> 31:43.379
<i>We don't know
that it's Higgins' fault.</i>

31:43.451 --> 31:45.544
<i>Robin can be the one
who's wrong about the date.</i>

31:45.620 --> 31:47.178
<i>I don't care who's at fault.</i>

31:47.255 --> 31:49.416
<i>What I do care about
is the money that I laid out</i>

31:49.490 --> 31:53.051
<i>for this stupid party
and the tab for this flight.</i>

32:02.136 --> 32:05.697
<i>Look, I'm sure Higgins
will be glad to pay you.</i>

32:05.773 --> 32:09.072
It's better than being in
trouble with Robin. Higgins!

32:09.143 --> 32:12.044
Did you say that Robin
was bringing 12 guests?

32:12.113 --> 32:13.842
<i>T. C., you made your point.</i>

32:13.915 --> 32:17.351
Twelve. Now I wonder why
that number sticks in my mind.

32:17.518 --> 32:21.852
<i>Ah, yes. I was once going to
cancel a party for 12 people.</i>

32:21.923 --> 32:23.550
Higgins!

32:23.624 --> 32:26.184
<i>But somebody said,
"No!"</i>

32:26.427 --> 32:29.225
That 12 is going
to turn into 50.

32:30.598 --> 32:33.761
Fifty old friends coming
to a time warp party.

32:33.835 --> 32:36.030
That's not what I had in mind.

32:57.692 --> 32:59.557
<i>Magnum, this radio is...</i>

33:05.299 --> 33:07.062
I'm calling the Coast Guard.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.901
Higgins!

33:11.873 --> 33:13.067
Thomas!

33:24.118 --> 33:26.211
Somebody stripped the radio.

33:26.854 --> 33:29.584
How far will you
have to fly to get help?

33:30.425 --> 33:32.825
<i>Not far, if I could fly.</i>

33:33.194 --> 33:35.219
The engine igniter's gone.

33:35.897 --> 33:38.457
<i>Man, we are stuck here
until we find it.</i>

33:58.019 --> 34:00.453
<i>Look, Al,
you've all got to leave.</i>

34:00.521 --> 34:01.852
We gotta get this place
cleaned up.

34:01.923 --> 34:04.050
I got Robin Masters
and 12 guests coming.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.821
Great. You got another
cooler of beer anywhere?

34:07.261 --> 34:08.853
Maybe in the fridge?

34:08.929 --> 34:10.864
<i>Maybe, you never know.</i>

34:11.599 --> 34:14.500
Why hasn't Thomas and T.C.
Called? It's been five hours.

34:14.835 --> 34:15.928
Rick?

34:16.971 --> 34:19.667
<i>Marge! Marge, honey. I'm sorry
that I made you wait so long.</i>

34:19.739 --> 34:20.967
<i>Oh, that's okay.</i>

34:21.042 --> 34:24.273
Al Cleary has been keeping me
and everyone else entertained.

34:24.344 --> 34:27.678
Yeah. Did you know that he could
balance a bottle on his nose?

34:27.748 --> 34:29.806
<i>Only when I'm happy,
which I'm not.</i>

34:29.884 --> 34:31.442
We've got big problems.

34:31.518 --> 34:33.248
<i>Plenty of beer, there's no ice.</i>

34:33.321 --> 34:36.290
Ice! That is the biggest worry
of your life? Ice?

34:36.357 --> 34:38.291
<i>Yeah, it's Saturday.</i>

34:39.360 --> 34:40.793
<i>What's happened to you, Rick?</i>

34:40.895 --> 34:44.295
<i>I don't know. I'm sorry, I...</i>

34:46.934 --> 34:51.199
<i>I really haven't been
feeling really good today, Al.</i>

34:51.272 --> 34:53.239
I had this headache

34:53.306 --> 34:56.242
and this sore throat.

34:56.310 --> 35:00.007
I'm getting these funny
little lumps underneath...

35:00.081 --> 35:01.275
Lumps?

35:01.816 --> 35:03.443
Mump lumps?

35:04.452 --> 35:06.977
<i>They can do terrible things
to a mature, adult male.</i>

35:07.054 --> 35:09.147
<i>Well, then you
won't have to worry.</i>

35:10.258 --> 35:12.749
<i>I really enjoyed it,
Rick. Gotta go!</i>

35:12.827 --> 35:14.089
Goodbye.

35:14.162 --> 35:15.424
Bye-bye.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.194
Feeling better?

35:21.269 --> 35:24.705
<i>I will, just as soon as I reach
Burbank, California Airport.</i>

35:29.043 --> 35:31.011
An elephant could have
done less damage.

35:31.078 --> 35:33.444
Somebody definitely doesn't
want these trails missed.

35:33.514 --> 35:34.708
Higgins?

35:34.782 --> 35:37.182
<i>Yeah, maybe, or maybe
the kids made these paths.</i>

35:37.251 --> 35:38.775
They could be running
from somebody.

35:38.853 --> 35:41.287
And so could he. Let's just
hope he's still able to run.

35:41.355 --> 35:43.721
<i>Yeah, well, pick a path.
I'll take the other.</i>

36:04.378 --> 36:06.005
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

36:10.184 --> 36:11.674
You all right?

36:12.220 --> 36:13.915
<i>You okay, T. C?</i>

36:22.279 --> 36:25.339
I distinctly recall
marking it on my calendar.

36:25.415 --> 36:26.973
Mr. Masters
was to arrive here

36:27.050 --> 36:29.382
next Saturday
afternoon at 3:00.

36:29.453 --> 36:32.115
Is it possible I forgot some
change in the arrangements?

36:32.189 --> 36:34.350
<i>Higgins, is that really
important right now?</i>

36:34.424 --> 36:37.291
We've got to find Thomas and
let him know what's going on.

36:37.361 --> 36:38.953
<i>Yes, I'll go search for him.</i>

36:39.029 --> 36:40.553
<i>No, we'll both go,
but in different directions.</i>

36:40.631 --> 36:43.566
<i>No, you're to stay here and continue
to apply comfrey to your wound.</i>

36:43.634 --> 36:45.192
<i>Higgins, I'm okay.</i>

36:46.503 --> 36:48.471
<i>No, you are not okay at all.</i>

36:48.539 --> 36:50.564
You have a highly inflamed gastrocnemius

36:50.641 --> 36:52.700
with a sympathetic
rectus femoris.

36:53.977 --> 36:56.377
Not to mention that someone
must stay here with Moki.

36:56.446 --> 36:57.913
What are his chances?

36:57.981 --> 37:00.040
That depends on how quickly
we get him to a hospital.

37:00.117 --> 37:01.414
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

37:01.485 --> 37:03.510
The fork in that path
that I told you about

37:03.587 --> 37:04.781
is your best shot
for finding Magnum.

37:04.855 --> 37:07.221
<i>T. C., I've been exploring
this island for nearly 24 hours.</i>

37:07.291 --> 37:10.226
<i>If you don't mind,
I'll plot my own course.</i>

37:10.294 --> 37:13.092
A net? What are you
gonna do with that?

37:14.031 --> 37:16.090
Better than I did yesterday.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.567
You've been out a long time.

37:27.978 --> 37:30.344
I didn't mean
to hit you so hard.

37:35.652 --> 37:38.280
Why didn't you give Haynes
the same consideration?

37:39.523 --> 37:41.115
Can you fly that chopper?

37:41.692 --> 37:44.889
<i>Nobody can fly it right now,
or I guess you know that.</i>

37:45.295 --> 37:48.423
One of you must have
done time for car-stripping.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.167
Where's Higgins?

37:51.235 --> 37:53.032
Can you fly the chopper or not?

37:55.906 --> 37:59.205
I don't think it'd be very
smart of me to answer you.

37:59.776 --> 38:03.303
<i>You'll shoot me now if I can't
fly it, or later if I can.</i>

38:03.647 --> 38:06.138
<i>No, you're wrong
and we can pay you!</i>

38:06.516 --> 38:08.381
Doug's got 30...
Clint!

38:11.154 --> 38:12.621
Thirty what?

38:13.790 --> 38:15.417
<i>$30,000?</i>

38:16.793 --> 38:18.124
<i>Oh, come on.
What are you hiding?</i>

38:18.228 --> 38:21.061
I didn't figure you earned it parking cars.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.796
<i>No, I got four counts
of robbery.</i>

38:28.338 --> 38:32.035
They're transferring me to
Federal when I turn 18 this year.

38:32.242 --> 38:35.040
Would you wanna sit in a
cell till you turned 27?

38:35.112 --> 38:37.910
<i>No, I guess not,
not with $30,000 waiting.</i>

38:38.482 --> 38:40.450
That's a lot of money
for one person.

38:57.534 --> 38:59.092
<i>Doug, we got no choice!</i>

38:59.169 --> 39:01.694
No! You shouldn't have
told him about my money!

39:35.205 --> 39:36.297
Moki?

39:51.722 --> 39:54.555
<i>$10,000 cash,
when you drop us in Maui.</i>

39:56.860 --> 39:58.987
<i>If you don't mind my asking,</i>

39:59.463 --> 40:03.229
were you really dumb enough not to
have an escape plan until we showed up?

40:03.300 --> 40:04.665
<i>No, we had a plan.</i>

40:04.735 --> 40:07.568
<i>Doug hid a life raft when he
made one of these trips before,</i>

40:08.205 --> 40:09.763
but we couldn't find it.

40:09.840 --> 40:14.038
<i>You brought a life raft, and Haynes
didn't ask you anything about it?</i>

40:16.446 --> 40:19.279
<i>Well, he didn't know. It was
folded up and hidden in a bag.</i>

40:20.117 --> 40:21.675
They'd have found it
at the dock!

40:21.752 --> 40:24.346
They search all the prisoners
before they let us on the boat.

40:24.421 --> 40:26.787
But they never search
the counselor's stuff.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.187
<i>What happened, Doug?</i>

40:30.260 --> 40:32.558
<i>Haynes didn't leave the raft
where he promised,</i>

40:32.629 --> 40:35.928
or maybe he didn't bring it at
all? Double cross works both ways.

40:35.999 --> 40:37.557
How much was he supposed to get?

40:37.634 --> 40:40.159
<i>Oh, the amount
doesn't matter, Clint.</i>

40:40.570 --> 40:42.834
Not when you don't
plan to pay off.

40:42.906 --> 40:45.534
<i>That is why you shot him,
isn't it, Doug?</i>

40:48.578 --> 40:50.205
Can you fly a chopper?

40:50.280 --> 40:51.372
<i>Doug, stop it!</i>

40:51.448 --> 40:53.211
<i>No, I'm gonna beat him!</i>

41:01.625 --> 41:02.853
You!

41:43.934 --> 41:46.698
Got it out of the chopper
when I stripped the radio.

41:46.770 --> 41:49.705
Thought I might need it
for skinning rabbits.

41:51.641 --> 41:53.802
<i>Thanks. Stay here, huh?</i>

42:23.440 --> 42:24.805
You'll be all right.

43:02.245 --> 43:03.337
Doug!

43:33.910 --> 43:35.673
<i>Nice going, Higgins.</i>

43:35.745 --> 43:37.076
Thank you.

43:37.347 --> 43:41.340
It would have been a great pity
to have gone up there for nothing.

43:49.259 --> 43:50.317
Quarantine?

43:50.393 --> 43:53.294
<i>I'm really sorry, Higgins,
but I did reach Robin in time.</i>

43:53.430 --> 43:54.522
You did?

43:54.598 --> 43:56.998
<i>Yeah, when they... When they
stopped to refuel in Burbank.</i>

43:57.067 --> 43:59.433
Then he took off and went back
to New York with his friends.

43:59.502 --> 44:01.299
<i>Very quick thinking, Orville.</i>

44:01.371 --> 44:04.272
Right. So the kids
are back in jail?

44:04.341 --> 44:06.969
<i>Yes, and Moki will be fine,</i>

44:07.043 --> 44:10.240
thanks to T.C.'s
quick thinking.

44:10.513 --> 44:15.348
Quick thinking is a trait that
I've often admired in all of you.

44:22.926 --> 44:24.655
This is the big one!
You owe me!

44:24.728 --> 44:26.025
We cleaned everything up here!

44:26.096 --> 44:27.654
We didn't miss a thing.

44:27.731 --> 44:30.097
Marge! You're not supposed to be down here!

44:30.166 --> 44:32.259
<i>No, I guess you shouldn't.
Hi, Marge.</i>

44:32.502 --> 44:33.594
Hi.

44:33.670 --> 44:37.003
<i>Guys, it doesn't look like
what it seems.</i>

44:37.073 --> 44:38.802
We were just too bushed
to drive home last night.

44:40.176 --> 44:41.165
Oh.

44:41.244 --> 44:42.643
We'll cover.

44:42.946 --> 44:44.038
Cover?

44:44.114 --> 44:47.606
<i>Get up there and get something on
before Higgins sees you, please!</i>

44:48.652 --> 44:49.880
I was correct.

44:49.953 --> 44:52.820
Mr. Masters was not due
here until next Saturday.

44:52.889 --> 44:56.757
<i>Good. Feel better now that you
know you weren't wrong, Higgins?</i>

44:57.093 --> 44:58.651
I'll feel better

44:58.895 --> 45:00.419
when you explain
the blonde nymph

45:00.497 --> 45:02.328
who just went upstairs
wearing my safari jacket.

45:03.099 --> 45:05.795
Perhaps she was still
here from yesterday?

45:06.469 --> 45:07.800
Yesterday?

45:07.871 --> 45:10.669
<i>You did want to make sure that I
was gone for the weekend, didn't you?</i>

45:10.740 --> 45:13.300
So you could have a gathering
of indolent jesting stock!

45:13.376 --> 45:15.367
<i>Oh, Higgins, you always
think the worst.</i>

45:15.445 --> 45:18.608
<i>Yeah. Who'd wanna spend a
pointless, all-day party anyway?</i>

45:18.682 --> 45:22.812
<i>Yes. People change, Higgins.
They get more mature.</i>

45:22.886 --> 45:24.319
Make adjustments.

45:28.958 --> 45:30.050
Yes.

45:31.961 --> 45:33.758
I suppose I don't accept

45:33.830 --> 45:36.355
the adjustments of age
terribly well.

45:36.433 --> 45:37.900
<i>Oh, really?</i>

45:38.601 --> 45:41.195
You made some great ones
out on that island.

45:43.940 --> 45:45.498
Thank you.

45:46.242 --> 45:49.609
And I'm pleased to learn
of your adjustments as well.

45:50.413 --> 45:52.938
You have truly decided
to abandon some of the more

45:53.016 --> 45:55.541
frivolous aspects
of your lifestyles.

45:57.787 --> 45:59.482
Are you giving up
tree-climbing?

46:01.958 --> 46:04.950
It's a strenuous feat
best left to the young.

46:07.664 --> 46:12.067
<i>However, I would try it again if
I deemed it absolutely necessary.</i>

46:12.702 --> 46:15.330
The same goes for
"frivolous aspects."

46:17.607 --> 46:19.234
Very commendable.

46:20.110 --> 46:23.045
<i>For that reason, I shall believe
that the young woman upstairs</i>

46:23.113 --> 46:26.173
has a perfectly innocent
reason for being here.

46:26.583 --> 46:29.017
I think it best. It is
your jacket she's wearing.

46:31.388 --> 46:32.480
Yes.

46:34.391 --> 46:39.419
<i>And if I have dismissed you
all at times for being childish,</i>

46:40.830 --> 46:43.162
let me take
this opportunity to say

46:43.233 --> 46:44.825
I'm sorry and...

46:48.204 --> 46:51.002
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

46:59.015 --> 47:00.312
Higgins...

47:00.750 --> 47:03.742
<i>Higgins, I can explain it.</i>
