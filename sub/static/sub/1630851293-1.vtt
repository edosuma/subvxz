00:30.766 --> 00:31.133
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.000
WE'RE BACK!

00:33.066 --> 00:33.466
STILL, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:33.533 --> 00:34.633
IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.466
I HAD HOPED WE'D BE OUT BY NOW,

00:36.533 --> 00:37.033
BUT INSTEAD, I'M STILL STUCK

00:37.100 --> 00:38.366
IN THE BLANKEST EXPANSE ON

00:38.433 --> 00:39.533
TELEVISION, ASIDE FROM THE EYES

00:39.600 --> 00:41.300
OF ROMAIN FROM "SELLING SUNSET."

00:41.366 --> 00:44.233
THERE'S JUST NOTHING THERE.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.666
WE'VE BEEN OFF SINCE NOVEMBER,

00:45.733 --> 00:46.433
AND CLEARLY, A LOT HAS HAPPENED

00:46.500 --> 00:47.233
SINCE THEN.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.900
THE VACCINE ROLLOUT BEGAN.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.333
WALL STREET WAS THROWN INTO

00:50.400 --> 00:51.600
A FRENZY OVER GAMESTOP,

00:51.666 --> 00:52.766
AND FOR A WEEK, EVERYONE GOT

00:52.833 --> 00:54.000
REALLY INTO SEA SHANTIES.

00:54.066 --> 00:56.333
IT'S BEEN A WEIRD TIME.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.566
BUT WE HAVE TO START TONIGHT

00:57.633 --> 00:58.100
WITH THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

00:58.166 --> 00:59.333
THAT TOOK PLACE THIS WEEK.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.366
DEMOCRATS PUT ON A COMPELLING,

01:03.433 --> 01:05.800
FORENSIC CASE ABOUT

01:05.866 --> 01:06.600
TRUMP'S CLEAR ROLE AS

01:06.666 --> 01:07.566
INSTIGATOR OF THE JANUARY 6th

01:07.633 --> 01:08.833

01:08.900 --> 01:10.166
AND IN RESPONSE, TRUMP'S

01:10.233 --> 01:10.833
ATTORNEYS MOUNTED A DEFENSE

01:10.900 --> 01:12.266
THAT COULD CHARITABLY BE

01:12.333 --> 01:13.500
CHARACTERIZED AS "INCOHERENT,"

01:13.566 --> 01:14.066
WITH LOWLIGHTS RANGING FROM

01:14.133 --> 01:14.866
ONE ATTORNEY REMINISCING ABOUT

01:14.933 --> 01:15.866
HIS CHILDHOOD RECORD COLLECTION,

01:15.933 --> 01:16.833
TO ANOTHER SUBJECTING THE SENATE

01:17.900 --> 01:18.666
DEMOCRATS SIMPLY USING

01:18.733 --> 01:20.166
THE WORD "FIGHT."

01:20.233 --> 01:21.966
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT THEY

01:22.033 --> 01:23.033
WEREN'T TRYING VERY HARD,

01:23.100 --> 01:25.100
BUT THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THEY

01:25.166 --> 01:26.633
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.433
TED CRUZ EVEN MET WITH TRUMP'S

01:28.500 --> 01:29.433
LAWYERS, WHILE THE CASE WAS

01:29.500 --> 01:30.266
STILL GOING ON, AND TOLD THEM

01:30.333 --> 01:31.500
THIS:

01:31.566 --> 01:32.500
>> I SAID, "LOOK, YOU GOT --

01:32.566 --> 01:33.266
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER YOU'VE

01:33.333 --> 01:33.833
ALREADY WON."

01:33.900 --> 01:34.666
THERE ARE NOT 67 VOTES

01:34.733 --> 01:37.766
TO CONVICT.

01:37.833 --> 01:40.000
THERE -- THERE ARE 55 VOTES

01:40.066 --> 01:41.933
TO CONVICT, PLUS-MINUS TWO.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.066
>> John: AND THE THING IS,

01:43.133 --> 01:44.566
HE WAS RIGHT.

01:44.633 --> 01:45.800
AND WHAT A TRULY INSPIRING

01:45.866 --> 01:46.800
GLIMPSE THAT IS INTO THE WORLD'S

01:46.866 --> 01:48.133
MOST DELIBERATIVE BODY.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.433
"I SAID TO THEM, YOU GOTTA

PREDETERMINED, NOTHING MEANS

01:51.833 --> 01:52.933
ANYTHING, AND THIS ENTIRE

NOW, HANDS IN, EVERYONE:

DEAD EYES, EMPTY HEARTS,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.333

01:58.400 --> 01:59.733
AND THE FACT THE REPUBLICANS

01:59.800 --> 02:00.900
WERE GOING TO ACQUIT

02:00.966 --> 02:02.800
THE FORMER PRESIDENT NO MATTER

02:02.866 --> 02:06.433
WHAT IS A PRETTY DEPRESSING SIGN

02:06.500 --> 02:07.933
OF JUST HOW DEEP TRUMPISM RUNS

02:08.000 --> 02:09.033
IN THEIR PARTY.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.533
BUT NOT JUST AT THE

02:10.600 --> 02:11.033
NATIONAL LEVEL.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.266
IN MANY WAYS, AT THE STATE

02:12.333 --> 02:13.133
LEVEL, IT'S EVEN WORSE.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.033
MORE THAN A DOZEN STATE

02:14.100 --> 02:15.066
LEGISLATORS ACTUALLY

02:15.133 --> 02:16.033
PARTICIPATED IN THE

02:16.100 --> 02:17.166
"STOP THE STEAL" RALLY

02:17.233 --> 02:18.066
PRECEDING THE RIOTS, AND ONE OF

02:18.133 --> 02:19.533
THEM EVEN MADE IT INSIDE.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.333
DERRICK EVANS, A NEWLY-ELECTED

02:21.400 --> 02:22.900
WEST VIRGINIA STATE LEGISLATOR,

02:22.966 --> 02:25.700
AND CHIPMUNK FRAT PLEDGE,

02:25.766 --> 02:27.000
WAS EVENTUALLY ARRESTED.

02:27.066 --> 02:28.566
AND WHILE HE MAINTAINED THAT

02:28.633 --> 02:29.966
HE WAS ONLY IN THE CAPITOL AS AN

02:30.033 --> 02:31.833
INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF THE MEDIA

02:31.900 --> 02:33.733
TO FILM HISTORY, THE HISTORY

02:33.800 --> 02:34.533
HE FILMED TOLD A VERY DIFFERENT

02:34.600 --> 02:35.500
STORY.

02:35.566 --> 02:36.566
>> TRUMP!

02:36.633 --> 02:37.633

02:37.700 --> 02:38.900
WHOO!

02:38.966 --> 02:39.900
WE'RE IN!

02:39.966 --> 02:41.366
WE'RE IN!

02:41.433 --> 02:44.766
DERRICK EVANS IS IN THE CAPITOL!

02:44.833 --> 02:46.100
>> John: NOW, EVERYTHING ABOUT

02:46.166 --> 02:47.466
THAT IS AWFUL.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.166
FROM THE FACT THAT A STATE

02:49.233 --> 02:50.100
LAWMAKER PARTICIPATED

02:50.166 --> 02:51.533
IN A DEADLY INSURRECTION,

02:51.600 --> 02:52.800
TO THE FACT HE WAS STUPID ENOUGH

02:52.866 --> 02:53.800
TO BROADCAST HIMSELF DOING IT,

02:53.866 --> 02:54.900
TO HIM EXCITEDLY TALKING ABOUT

02:54.966 --> 02:56.433
HIMSELF IN THE THIRD PERSON LIKE

02:56.500 --> 02:58.466
SOME KIND OF ALT-RIGHT ELMO.

02:58.533 --> 02:59.900
AND WHILE EVANS HAS SINCE

02:59.966 --> 03:01.066
RESIGNED, HE'S JUST THE TIP OF

03:01.133 --> 03:02.700
THE ICEBERG WHEN IT COMES TO

03:02.766 --> 03:03.933
EXTREME BEHAVIOR IN STATE

03:04.000 --> 03:05.866
REPUBLICAN PARTIES.

03:05.933 --> 03:07.300
OREGON'S STATE G.O.P. PUT OUT

03:07.366 --> 03:09.166
A STATEMENT CLAIMING THE RIOTS

03:09.233 --> 03:10.300
WERE A "FALSE FLAG OPERATION

03:10.366 --> 03:10.900
DESIGNED TO DISCREDIT

03:10.966 --> 03:12.533
PRESIDENT TRUMP."

03:12.600 --> 03:14.466
AND MICHIGAN'S TOP ELECTED

03:14.533 --> 03:16.533
REPUBLICAN WAS CAUGHT ON TAPE

03:16.600 --> 03:17.400
SPEWING DANGEROUS CONSPIRACIES

03:17.466 --> 03:18.133
LIKE THIS:

03:18.200 --> 03:19.300
>> SENATE MAJORITY LEADER

03:19.366 --> 03:20.500
MIKE SHIRKEY IN HIS OWN WORDS

03:20.566 --> 03:21.700
TALKING ABOUT THE DEADLY

03:21.766 --> 03:23.500
JANUARY 6TH CAPITOL RIOTS,

03:23.566 --> 03:24.833
SAYING IT WAS PREARRANGED, AND

03:24.900 --> 03:26.666
THAT IT WASN'T TRUMP'S PEOPLE.

03:26.733 --> 03:27.300
>> THAT'S BEEN A HOAX FROM DAY

03:27.366 --> 03:29.000
ONE.

03:29.066 --> 03:30.700
THAT WAS ALL PREARRANGED.

03:30.766 --> 03:31.933
THAT WAS ALL ARRANGED BY

03:32.000 --> 03:33.733
SOMEBODY THAT WAS FUNDING IT.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.866
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

03:34.933 --> 03:36.833
TALKING ABOUT, SHIRKEY?

03:36.900 --> 03:37.933
TO THE EXTENT JANUARY 6TH WAS

03:38.000 --> 03:39.900
"PREARRANGED" BY ANYONE,

03:39.966 --> 03:41.366
IT WAS CLEARLY BY TRUMP, AS HE

03:41.433 --> 03:43.266
REPEATEDLY TWEETED THINGS

03:43.333 --> 03:44.433
LIKE, "BIG PROTEST IN D.C.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.600
ON JANUARY 6TH...

03:45.666 --> 03:46.700
BE THERE, WILL BE WILD!"

03:46.766 --> 03:48.466
WHICH, TO BE FAIR, WAS ONE OF

03:48.533 --> 03:49.566
THOSE OCCASIONS WHERE HE TURNED

03:49.633 --> 03:51.666
OUT TO BE COMPLETELY RIGHT.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.533
AND I KNOW THAT MAN LOOKS LIKE

03:53.600 --> 03:54.433
HE ANSWERS THE QUESTION,

03:54.500 --> 03:55.600
"WHAT IF STEVE MARTIN WAS

03:55.666 --> 03:57.233
AWFUL?," BUT THE FACT IS,

03:57.300 --> 03:58.500
HE'S THE MAJORITY LEADER OF

03:58.566 --> 04:00.000
THE MICHIGAN SENATE.

04:00.066 --> 04:01.733
HE HAS REAL POWER.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.000
THEN THERE'S ARIZONA, WHERE

04:03.066 --> 04:05.033
THEIR REPUBLICAN PARTY CENSURED

04:05.100 --> 04:06.500
THREE PEOPLE -- INCLUDING THEIR

04:06.566 --> 04:07.433
GOVERNOR AND CINDY McCAIN --

04:07.500 --> 04:08.733
FOR NOT SUFFICIENTLY SUPPORTING

04:08.800 --> 04:10.100
TRUMP.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.733
AND IN EARLY DECEMBER, DID THIS:

04:11.800 --> 04:13.233
>> USING THE "STOP THE STEAL"

04:13.300 --> 04:16.066
SLOGAN, A TRUMP SUPPORTER

04:16.133 --> 04:17.266
WRITES, "I AM WILLING TO GIVE

04:17.333 --> 04:18.733
MY LIFE FOR THIS FIGHT."

04:18.800 --> 04:20.133
THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY

04:20.200 --> 04:20.600
RESPONDS, "HE IS.

04:20.666 --> 04:22.366
ARE YOU?"

04:22.433 --> 04:23.933
THEN THE OFFICIAL PARTY DOUBLES

04:24.000 --> 04:25.366
DOWN, TWEETING OVERNIGHT A CLIP

04:25.433 --> 04:26.700
FROM "RAMBO" AND THE QUOTE,

04:26.766 --> 04:28.266
"THIS IS WHAT WE DO, WHO WE ARE.

04:28.333 --> 04:29.400
LIVE FOR NOTHING, OR DIE FOR

04:29.466 --> 04:31.833
SOMETHING."

04:31.900 --> 04:33.733
>> John: OKAY, ASIDE FROM BEING

04:33.800 --> 04:34.866
COMPLETELY TERRIFYING, THAT

04:34.933 --> 04:36.933
QUOTE IS FROM THE 2008 "RAMBO"

04:37.000 --> 04:38.800
MOVIE -- AT THAT POINT, THE

04:38.866 --> 04:39.633
WORST "RAMBO" MOVIE, UNTIL THEY

04:39.700 --> 04:40.833
MADE ANOTHER ONE.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.133
I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU

04:42.200 --> 04:43.300
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO QUOTE

04:43.366 --> 04:44.633
STALLONE, THERE ARE SO MANY

04:44.700 --> 04:45.633
BETTER OPTIONS.

04:45.700 --> 04:46.933
THEY COULD HAVE GONE WITH,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.200
"TO SURVIVE A WAR, YOU GOTTA

04:48.266 --> 04:49.400
BECOME WAR," FROM

04:49.466 --> 04:50.700
"RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II."

04:50.766 --> 04:51.900
OR "THIS CHILDISH GAME WILL SOON

04:51.966 --> 04:52.366
BE OVER.

04:52.433 --> 04:54.166
AND THEN THE REAL GAME WILL

04:54.233 --> 04:54.966
BEGIN," FROM "SPY KIDS 3D:

04:55.033 --> 04:57.166
GAME OVER."

04:57.233 --> 04:58.266
OR EVEN THIS ACTUAL STALLONE

04:58.333 --> 04:59.100
TWEET: "EVERYONE SHOULD TRY

04:59.166 --> 05:00.166
PAINTING!

05:00.233 --> 05:02.700
GET STROKING!"

05:02.766 --> 05:04.833
I MEAN, SURE, IT DOESN'T MAKE

05:04.900 --> 05:05.733
MUCH SENSE, BUT AT LEAST IT'S

05:05.800 --> 05:06.600
NOT LIKELY TO LEAD TO PEOPLE

05:06.666 --> 05:07.700
GETTING KILLED.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.933
AND IT'S NOT JUST PARTY

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
OFFICIALS.

05:11.066 --> 05:13.666
REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN ARIZONA

05:13.733 --> 05:15.033
HAVE TRIED, AMONG OTHER

05:15.100 --> 05:16.266
THINGS, TO HOLD THE MARICOPA

05:16.333 --> 05:17.866
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

05:17.933 --> 05:18.633
IN CONTEMPT FOR REFUSING TO TURN

05:18.700 --> 05:19.333
OVER VOTING MACHINES AND BALLOTS

05:19.400 --> 05:21.066
FOR INSPECTION.

05:21.133 --> 05:22.966
AND ONE LAWMAKER INTRODUCED THIS

05:23.033 --> 05:24.433
PARTICULARLY EXTREME BILL:

05:24.500 --> 05:26.233
>> UNDER HOUSE BILL 27-20,

05:26.300 --> 05:27.600
THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVOKE

05:27.666 --> 05:28.866
THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S

05:28.933 --> 05:30.366
CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION,

05:30.433 --> 05:31.533
AND APPOINT MEMBERS TO THE

05:31.600 --> 05:33.433
ELECTORAL COLLEGE THAT IT WANTS.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.800
HAD THIS BEEN THE LAW IN

05:34.866 --> 05:36.400
NOVEMBER, THE G.O.P.-LED

05:36.466 --> 05:39.600
LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE GIVEN

05:39.666 --> 05:40.733
THE STATE'S 11 ELECTORAL COLLEGE

05:40.800 --> 05:41.533
VOTES TO FORMER PRESIDENT

05:41.600 --> 05:42.833
DONALD TRUMP.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.633
THIS MORNING, SECRETARY OF STATE

05:45.700 --> 05:47.100
KATIE HOBBS APPEARED ON "GOOD

05:47.166 --> 05:48.833
MORNING ARIZONA" TO SAY THIS.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.566
>> WHY NOT JUST DO AWAY WITH

05:50.633 --> 05:51.666
ELECTIONS ALTOGETHER, AND JUST

05:51.733 --> 05:52.300
HAVE THE LEGISLATURE PICK ALL OF

05:52.366 --> 05:53.700
OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS?

05:53.766 --> 05:55.233
THAT -- THAT WAS SARCASM.

05:55.300 --> 05:56.833
YEAH, THIS LEGISLATION IS

05:56.900 --> 05:58.733
LUDICROUS.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.600
>> John: OKAY, I DO TAKE YOUR

06:00.666 --> 06:01.966
POINT THERE, BUT HAVING TO

06:02.033 --> 06:04.200
EXPLAIN SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID

06:04.266 --> 06:05.433
WAS SARCASTIC IS NEVER IDEAL.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.366
IT KIND OF ROBS THE SARCASM OF

06:06.433 --> 06:08.066
ITS BITE.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.666
NEXT TIME, WHY NOT JUST USE

06:09.733 --> 06:10.933
A SARCASM ALERT HORN?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.366
THAT WAY, THE HORN DOES ALL THE

06:12.433 --> 06:13.533
WORK FOR YOU.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.133
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M

06:14.200 --> 06:15.333
TELLING YOU THIS.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.500
YOU'RE CLEARLY SO GOOD AT

06:16.566 --> 06:17.300
SARCASM.

06:17.366 --> 06:18.533
[HORN HONKS]

06:18.600 --> 06:19.533
SEE?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.966
IT WORKS.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.366
BUT THAT BILL ACTUALLY POINTS TO

06:23.433 --> 06:24.400
A MUCH LARGER ISSUE HERE:

06:24.466 --> 06:25.366
REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES ACROSS

06:25.433 --> 06:27.000

06:28.666 --> 06:30.233
SECURE ELECTION IN U.S. HISTORY"

06:30.300 --> 06:31.466

06:31.533 --> 06:32.533

06:32.600 --> 06:33.833
DIFFICULT.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.700

06:35.766 --> 06:37.366
19 BILLS TO RESTRICT VOTING

06:37.433 --> 06:38.566

06:45.366 --> 06:46.900

06:46.966 --> 06:48.866

06:48.933 --> 06:50.533
AND THE JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS

06:50.600 --> 06:52.266
ADVANCEMENT ACT -- THAT COULD

06:52.333 --> 06:54.400
HELP CURB STATE-LEVEL ATTEMPTS

06:54.466 --> 06:55.266
AT VOTER SUPPRESSION.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.400
UNFORTUNATELY, THE BEST SHOT

06:56.466 --> 06:57.866
THOSE BILLS HAVE AT GETTING

06:57.933 --> 06:58.833
ENACTED IS IF DEMOCRATS

06:58.900 --> 06:59.700
END THE FILIBUSTER.

06:59.766 --> 07:01.033

12:36.233 --> 12:37.833
AND THREE: NO GRIM TIDINGS OF

12:37.900 --> 12:38.766
THE VIRAL APOCALYPSE.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.100
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

12:40.166 --> 12:41.933
THAT'S A BOAT FOUL, DR. BUMMER.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.766
>> BOAT FOUL!

12:42.833 --> 12:48.166
>> John: INDEED.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.700
AND WHILE YOU WOULD HOPE THAT

12:49.766 --> 12:50.933
THE LAST YEAR WOULD BE A WAKE-UP

12:51.000 --> 12:51.966
CALL TO EVERYONE, THOSE WHO

12:52.033 --> 12:52.900
STUDY PANDEMICS ARE SKEPTICAL

12:52.966 --> 12:53.800
THAT WE'VE LEARNED NEARLY

12:53.866 --> 12:54.733
ENOUGH.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.966
>> I THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN IN

12:56.033 --> 12:57.500
HISTORY OF LOOKING AT THESE

12:57.566 --> 12:58.066
PATHOGENS OVER TIME IS THAT

12:58.133 --> 12:59.000
WE USUALLY GO RIGHT BACK TO

12:59.066 --> 13:00.066
BUSINESS AS USUAL AS SOON AS

13:00.133 --> 13:00.800
THE THING ENDS, AS SOON AS WE

13:00.866 --> 13:02.166
HAVE A DRUG, AS SOON AS WE HAVE

13:02.233 --> 13:03.933
A VACCINE, AS SOON AS WE CAN

13:04.000 --> 13:06.533
KIND OF GHETTOIZE THESE DISEASES

13:06.600 --> 13:07.700
INTO MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS.

13:07.766 --> 13:09.733
WE DON'T REALLY DO THE

13:09.800 --> 13:10.433
FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL CHANGE

13:10.500 --> 13:11.500
THAT WE COULD DO.

13:11.566 --> 13:13.600
>> John: EXACTLY.

13:13.666 --> 13:14.766
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS EVERY

13:14.833 --> 13:16.100
CHANCE THAT AFTER ALL THIS IS

13:16.166 --> 13:18.700
OVER, WE'LL END UP TREATING

13:18.766 --> 13:19.600
THE CORONAVIRUS LIKE A REALLY

13:19.666 --> 13:21.033
BAD FART AT THANKSGIVING.

13:21.100 --> 13:21.966
THAT IS, WAITING PATIENTLY FOR

13:22.033 --> 13:23.166
IT TO DISSIPATE SO WE CAN

13:23.233 --> 13:24.566
NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN AND

13:24.633 --> 13:25.266
COLLECTIVELY PRETEND THAT

13:25.333 --> 13:28.800
IT DIDN'T JUST KILL GRANDMA.

13:28.866 --> 13:29.800
SO GIVEN ALL OF THAT, TONIGHT,

13:29.866 --> 13:31.166
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NEXT

13:31.233 --> 13:33.433
PANDEMIC -- SPECIFICALLY,

13:33.500 --> 13:34.033
WHERE NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASES

13:34.100 --> 13:34.633
COME FROM, WHY THEY'RE ON THE

13:34.700 --> 13:35.433
RISE, AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO

13:35.500 --> 13:36.200
LIMIT THEM.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.300
AND LET'S START WITH HOW WE GOT

13:37.366 --> 13:39.366
INTO OUR CURRENT SITUATION.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.200
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS CAUSED

13:41.266 --> 13:42.700
BY A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS CALLED

13:42.766 --> 13:44.566
"SARS-COV-2," WHICH ORIGINATED

13:44.633 --> 13:46.066
IN ANIMALS BEFORE JUMPING TO

13:46.133 --> 13:47.133
HUMANS.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.800
AND THAT IS BY NO MEANS UNUSUAL.

13:48.866 --> 13:50.666
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 75%

13:50.733 --> 13:52.900
OF NEW OR EMERGING INFECTIOUS

13:52.966 --> 13:53.666
DISEASES COME FROM ANIMALS.

13:53.733 --> 13:54.566
THEY'RE CALLED

13:54.633 --> 13:56.233
"ZOONOTIC DISEASES" OR

13:56.300 --> 13:57.533
"ZOONOSES."

13:57.600 --> 13:58.800
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH

13:58.866 --> 14:00.166
"ZOO NOSE," WHICH, FOR THE

14:00.233 --> 14:01.600
RECORD, IS A VERY HURTFUL THING

14:01.666 --> 14:03.166
TO CALL A TEENAGER WHO'S ALREADY

14:03.233 --> 14:05.066
GOT ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.000
AND COVID IS BY NO MEANS THE

14:07.066 --> 14:08.233
ONLY ZOONOTIC DISEASE OUT THERE.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.700
THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED

14:09.766 --> 14:11.000
1.7 MILLION CURRENTLY

14:11.066 --> 14:12.866
UNDISCOVERED VIRUSES IN MAMMALS

14:12.933 --> 14:14.133
AND BIRDS, OF WHICH BETWEEN

14:14.200 --> 14:15.666
SIX AND 800,000 COULD HAVE

14:15.733 --> 14:18.466
THE ABILITY TO INFECT HUMANS.

14:18.533 --> 14:19.433
AND LOTS OF ANIMAL SPECIES ARE

14:19.500 --> 14:21.866
HOSTS FOR ZOONOTIC DISEASE.

14:21.933 --> 14:23.033
BIRDS AND PIGS CAN HARBOR

14:23.100 --> 14:24.233
INFLUENZA.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.733
CHIMPANZEES WERE THE BRIDGE OF

14:25.800 --> 14:27.533
HIV TO HUMANS, AND TURTLES CAN

14:27.600 --> 14:29.033
CARRY SALMONELLA, WHICH IS

14:29.100 --> 14:30.566
SOMETHING WE ALL REMEMBER FROM

14:30.633 --> 14:31.666
ONE OF THE DARKEST EPISODES OF

14:31.733 --> 14:34.600
THE NINJA TURTLES CARTOON.

14:34.666 --> 14:39.300
THAT'S RIGHT: ONE OF THEIR

14:39.366 --> 14:42.766
TURTLE POWERS SEEMED TO BE

14:42.833 --> 14:43.700
INADVERTENTLY KILLING

14:43.766 --> 14:44.933
APRIL O'NEIL.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.100
ONE OF THE BIGGEST VECTORS

14:46.166 --> 14:46.733
FOR TRANSMITTING VIRUSES IS,

14:46.800 --> 14:47.633
FAMOUSLY, BATS.

14:47.700 --> 14:48.733
THEY'VE BEEN LINKED TO EBOLA,

14:48.800 --> 14:49.433
THE DEADLY NIPAH VIRUS, AND

14:49.500 --> 14:50.366
COVID-19.

14:50.433 --> 14:51.100
IN FACT, HERE IS THAT EERILY

14:51.166 --> 14:52.300
PRESCIENT EXPERT THAT YOU SAW

14:52.366 --> 14:53.533
EARLIER WARNING OF THE DANGERS

14:53.600 --> 14:54.633
OF A POPULAR BAT-BASED TOURIST

14:54.700 --> 14:56.566
ATTRACTION BACK IN 2016.

14:56.633 --> 14:57.633
>> THE BATS HERE IN THIS CAVE

14:57.700 --> 14:59.533
ARE THE SAME BATS THAT CARRY

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
SARS VIRUS.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.466
WHEN THEY'RE UP THERE, THEY

15:02.533 --> 15:03.500
URINATE AND DEFECATE RIGHT ON

15:03.566 --> 15:04.733
TOP OF THE TOURISTS THAT ARE

15:04.800 --> 15:05.633
WALKING THROUGH.

15:05.700 --> 15:06.833
AND ALL YOU HAVE GOT TO DO IS BE

15:06.900 --> 15:09.433
THAT ONE PERSON TO BREATHE IN AT

15:09.500 --> 15:10.733
THE WRONG TIME, AND SUDDENLY YOU

15:10.800 --> 15:12.566
HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH A --

15:12.633 --> 15:13.966
WITH A VIRUS THAT IS NOT ONLY

15:14.033 --> 15:15.966
POTENTIALLY LETHAL TO PEOPLE, IT

15:16.033 --> 15:18.800
COULD CAUSE A FUTURE PANDEMIC.

15:18.866 --> 15:19.433
>> John: THAT'S HORRIBLE -- AND

15:19.500 --> 15:21.800
NOT JUST THE DISEASE PART.

15:21.866 --> 15:23.766
JUST THE VERY CONCEPT OF THIS

15:23.833 --> 15:25.200
WALK-IN BAT TOILET BEING

15:25.266 --> 15:26.833
A TOURIST DESTINATION.

15:26.900 --> 15:27.933
THAT MIGHT BE THE WORST TOURIST

15:28.000 --> 15:29.466
ATTRACTION SINCE DISNEYLAND PUT

15:29.533 --> 15:30.566
JOHNNY DEPP ANIMATRONICS IN THE

15:30.633 --> 15:32.166
"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN" RIDE.

15:32.233 --> 15:33.300
C'MON, DISNEY, THERE'S KIDS

15:33.366 --> 15:34.366
HERE!

15:34.433 --> 15:36.066
THEY'RE HERE TO WATCH SOME JOLLY

15:36.133 --> 15:37.700
NAUTICAL RAPISTS AND THIEVES,

15:37.766 --> 15:38.966
NOT A WEIRD, SAD MILLIONAIRE

15:39.033 --> 15:41.900
DOING A B-PLUS KEITH RICHARDS.

15:41.966 --> 15:43.466
NOW THERE ARE REASONS THAT BATS

15:43.533 --> 15:46.200
ARE SUCH GOOD HOSTS FOR DISEASE.

15:46.266 --> 15:47.033
THEY CAN FLY, SO THEY CAN COVER

15:47.100 --> 15:48.366
LARGE DISTANCES.

15:48.433 --> 15:49.400
THEY'VE DEVELOPED SPECIALIZED

15:49.466 --> 15:50.666
IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT DON'T

15:50.733 --> 15:51.733
OVERREACT TO INFECTIONS, WHICH

15:51.800 --> 15:53.366
KEEPS THEM FROM FALLING ILL.

15:53.433 --> 15:54.666
AND THEY ARE INSANELY PLENTIFUL.

15:54.733 --> 15:56.666
NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S

15:56.733 --> 15:59.833
MAMMAL SPECIES ARE BATS.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.366
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "GREAT,

16:01.433 --> 16:03.000
THEN THERE'S AN EASY FIX HERE:

16:03.066 --> 16:08.033
LET'S SIMPLY KILL ALL BATS,"

16:08.100 --> 16:09.733
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A GREAT

16:09.800 --> 16:10.700
IDEA, FOR MULTIPLE REASONS.

16:10.766 --> 16:11.366
NOT ONLY ARE THEY CRUCIAL

16:11.433 --> 16:12.300
ELEMENTS OF OUR ECOSYSTEM,

16:12.366 --> 16:13.066
THEY'RE ALSO WAY CUTER THAN

16:13.133 --> 16:14.333
THEY'RE OFTEN GIVEN CREDIT FOR!

16:14.400 --> 16:15.533
JUST LOOK AT THIS FUZZY LITTLE

16:15.600 --> 16:17.733
GOOBER EATING A BANANA!

16:17.800 --> 16:18.833
LOOK AT THIS ONE SCARFING DOWN

16:18.900 --> 16:20.966
A WATERMELON!

16:21.033 --> 16:22.366
AND JUST LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GUY

16:22.433 --> 16:23.400
TRYING TO ABSOLUTELY HOUSE

16:23.466 --> 16:24.100
A SINGLE GRAPE.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.200
LOOK AT HIM GO!

16:25.266 --> 16:26.500
WHO'S STRUGGLING WITH A GRAPE?

16:26.566 --> 16:27.100
YOU ARE!

16:27.166 --> 16:28.500
YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH A GRAPE,

16:28.566 --> 16:30.833
YOU LITTLE GOTH MOUSE!

16:30.900 --> 16:33.266
ALSO, IT IS IMPORTANT TO

16:33.333 --> 16:34.966
REMEMBER THAT THE FACT THAT WE

16:35.033 --> 16:36.166
MAY'VE CAUGHT COVID FROM BATS

16:36.233 --> 16:37.166
ISN'T SO MUCH THEIR FAULT AS IT

16:37.233 --> 16:39.133
IS OURS.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.866
BECAUSE OUTBREAKS OF BAT VIRUSES

16:40.933 --> 16:42.533
DON'T TEND TO COME FROM THEM

16:42.600 --> 16:43.866
SEEKING US OUT; THEY USUALLY

16:43.933 --> 16:45.966
HAPPEN WHEN A HUMAN TAKES A BAT

16:46.033 --> 16:47.166
SOMEWHERE IT'D NEVER GO ON ITS

16:47.233 --> 16:49.166
OWN OR INTRUDES ON ITS HOME.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.133
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

16:51.200 --> 16:53.366
THE FIRST BIG THING WE'RE DOING

16:53.433 --> 16:54.166
THAT MAY WELL BRING ABOUT THE

16:54.233 --> 16:55.233
NEXT PANDEMIC.

16:55.300 --> 16:56.833
AND THAT IS ERASING THE BUFFER

16:56.900 --> 16:57.833
BETWEEN CIVILIZATION AND

16:57.900 --> 16:58.800
WILDLIFE.

16:58.866 --> 17:00.366
SCIENTISTS HAVE REPEATEDLY

17:00.433 --> 17:01.566
WARNED US ABOUT THE DANGERS OF

17:01.633 --> 17:03.200
DEFORESTATION, URBANIZATION,

17:03.266 --> 17:04.566
MINING, AND GENERALLY

17:04.633 --> 17:06.333
SUPPLANTING NATURAL HABITATS,

17:06.400 --> 17:07.500
WHICH HAS BEEN FAR MORE

17:07.566 --> 17:10.700
EXTENSIVE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

17:10.766 --> 17:12.900
>> MANY PEOPLE IMAGINE THERE'S

17:12.966 --> 17:13.633
THIS UNTOUCHED WILDERNESS

17:13.700 --> 17:14.800
BECAUSE THEY SEE IT ON THEIR

17:14.866 --> 17:16.966
TV SCREENS, BUT THE REALITY IS,

17:17.033 --> 17:17.966
THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF WILD

17:18.033 --> 17:20.600
LEFT THERE.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.033
>> WE'VE ALREADY LOST NEARLY

17:22.100 --> 17:23.000
90% OF THE WETLANDS AROUND

17:23.066 --> 17:24.900
THE WORLD.

17:24.966 --> 17:26.266
WE'VE TRANSFORMED THE FORESTS,

17:26.333 --> 17:28.433
OUR GRASSLANDS.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.466
WE'VE CONVERTED 75% OF THE LAND

17:31.533 --> 17:33.900
THAT IS NOT COVERED BY ICE.

17:33.966 --> 17:34.833
>> THREE QUARTERS OF THE

17:34.900 --> 17:35.433
TERRESTRIAL SURFACE HAS BEEN

17:35.500 --> 17:36.466
CHANGED.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.033
A LOT OF IT JUST TO FEED ONE

17:37.100 --> 17:38.200
SPECIES.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.433
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.366
WE'VE CHANGED THREE-QUARTERS OF

17:41.433 --> 17:43.133
THE EARTH'S LAND AREAS!

17:43.200 --> 17:44.733
AND WHILE SOME OF THAT WAS

17:44.800 --> 17:46.333
NECESSARY, WE HAVE ALSO CHANGED

17:46.400 --> 17:47.933
A LOT TO BUILD DUMB, POINTLESS

17:48.033 --> 17:49.566
SHIT THAT NO ONE REALLY WANTS OR

17:49.633 --> 17:51.266
NEEDS, LIKE PAINTBALL COURSES,

17:51.333 --> 17:53.766
OR NOVELTY T-SHIRT SHOPS, OR

17:53.833 --> 17:55.100
SALT LAKE CITY.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.500
AND THAT VANISHING BOUNDARY

17:56.566 --> 17:58.066
HAS BROUGHT INCREASED RISK.

17:58.133 --> 17:59.633
OVER 30% OF NEW AND EMERGING

17:59.700 --> 18:00.800
DISEASES ARE LINKED TO

18:00.866 --> 18:02.100
DEFORESTATION AND LAND USE

18:02.166 --> 18:03.200
CHANGE.

18:03.266 --> 18:04.500
TAKE THE AMAZON.

18:04.566 --> 18:05.666
STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT

18:05.733 --> 18:07.166
CLEARING PATCHES OF FOREST

18:07.233 --> 18:08.700
APPEARS TO CREATE THE IDEAL

18:08.766 --> 18:10.266
HABITAT ALONG FOREST EDGES FOR

18:10.333 --> 18:11.700
THE TYPE OF MOSQUITO THAT'S

18:11.766 --> 18:13.100
THE MOST COMMON TRANSMITTER OF

18:13.166 --> 18:14.200
MALARIA THERE.

18:14.266 --> 18:16.500
OR TAKE WEST AFRICA.

18:16.566 --> 18:18.600
THE FIRST VICTIM OF 2014'S

18:18.666 --> 18:19.666
EBOLA OUTBREAK WAS A YOUNG BOY

18:19.733 --> 18:21.033
WHO'D BEEN SEEN PLAYING NEAR

18:21.100 --> 18:22.833
A TREE INFESTED WITH BATS BEFORE

18:22.900 --> 18:23.800
HE GOT SICK.

18:23.866 --> 18:24.900
HE LIVED IN A SMALL VILLAGE

18:24.966 --> 18:26.800
WHERE MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING

18:26.866 --> 18:27.566
FOREST HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY

18:27.633 --> 18:28.966
FOREIGN MINING AND TIMBER

18:29.033 --> 18:29.700
OPERATIONS.

18:29.766 --> 18:33.100
AND EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

18:33.166 --> 18:34.033
THAT IS WHAT BROUGHT THE BATS

18:34.100 --> 18:35.366
INTO HIS VILLAGE.

18:35.433 --> 18:39.066
AND BEFORE YOU THINK THIS IS

18:39.133 --> 18:41.900
JUST AN OVERSEAS PROBLEM, IT IS

18:41.966 --> 18:42.833
WORTH REMEMBERING THAT ONE OF

18:42.900 --> 18:44.800
THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES OF HABITAT

18:44.866 --> 18:45.433
DESTRUCTION FUELING AN EMERGING

18:45.500 --> 18:46.066
DISEASE HAPPENED RIGHT HERE IN

18:46.133 --> 18:47.066
THE U.S., WHERE LYME DISEASE WAS

18:47.133 --> 18:48.600
FIRST IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTICUT

18:48.666 --> 18:49.400
IN THE 1980s, AND WAS DRIVEN BY

18:49.466 --> 18:52.333
SUBURBANIZATION.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.166
>> WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT THE

18:54.233 --> 18:55.633
PROBABILITY THAT A TICK IS GOING

18:55.700 --> 18:57.600
TO ACQUIRE AN INFECTION WHEN IT

18:57.666 --> 18:59.633
FEEDS ON A WHITE FOOTED MOUSE IS

18:59.700 --> 19:01.533
ABOUT 90%.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.500
AS WE FRAGMENT THE LANDSCAPE,

19:03.566 --> 19:05.433
WE CHOP UP CONTINUOUS FOREST

19:05.500 --> 19:05.966
INTO LITTLE BITS, WE LOSE

19:06.033 --> 19:06.700
SPECIES.

19:06.766 --> 19:10.000
THEY DISAPPEAR.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.500
ONE OF THE LAST CREATURES IS

19:11.566 --> 19:14.433
THE WHITE FOOTED MOUSE.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.966
SO AS WE REDUCE DIVERSITY, WE'RE

19:16.033 --> 19:17.600
LOSING THE SPECIES THAT PROTECT

19:17.666 --> 19:18.700
US AND FAVORING THE ONES THAT

19:18.766 --> 19:19.100
MAKE US SICK.

19:19.166 --> 19:20.700
>> John: RIGHT.

19:20.766 --> 19:21.900
WE FRAGMENTED THE LANDSCAPE

19:21.966 --> 19:23.766
AND THAT DROVE OUT PREDATORS,

19:23.833 --> 19:24.800
LEAVING CREATURES LIKE

19:24.866 --> 19:26.300
WHITE-FOOTED MICE, WHO ARE THE

19:26.366 --> 19:27.866
MAIN CULPRITS WHEN IT COMES TO

19:27.933 --> 19:29.200
LYME DISEASE TRANSMISSION.

19:29.266 --> 19:31.966
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS:

19:32.033 --> 19:33.500
FUCK WHITE-FOOTED MICE.

19:33.566 --> 19:34.900
THEY CAN GO FUCK THEMSELVES.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.466
UNLIKE, OF COURSE, RATS, WHO CAN

19:36.533 --> 19:39.066
AND SHOULD GO FUCK EACH OTHER.

19:39.133 --> 19:39.900
BUT IT'S NOT JUST US MOVING

19:39.966 --> 19:40.933
CLOSER TO ANIMALS.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.433
IT'S THAT, MORE AND MORE,

19:42.500 --> 19:43.733
WE'RE BRINGING WILD ANIMALS INTO

19:43.800 --> 19:45.266
CONTACT WITH US THROUGH THE

19:45.333 --> 19:46.466
WILDLIFE TRADE.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.966
NOW SOMETIMES THAT TAKES THE

19:48.033 --> 19:49.333
FORM OF EXOTIC PETS, WHETHER

19:49.400 --> 19:51.166
IT'S WHEN PARIS HILTON GOT A

19:51.233 --> 19:53.366
KINKAJOU NAMED BABYLUV, OR THIS

19:53.433 --> 19:55.100
RANDOM BRITISH MAN'S EXTREMELY

19:55.166 --> 19:56.533
ILL-ADVISED ROOMMATE.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.933
>> AN ORDINARY STREET IN KENT

19:59.000 --> 20:00.833
AND A SUBURBAN SEMI WITH A

20:00.900 --> 20:01.766
NORMAL CONSERVATORY.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.500
BUT IT'S LICENSED FOR SOMETHING

20:03.566 --> 20:06.333
FAR FROM NORMAL.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.633
IS A CROCODILE A SUITABLE PET TO

20:07.700 --> 20:08.633
HAVE IN A SUBURBAN HOUSE LIKE

20:08.700 --> 20:10.266
THIS?

20:10.333 --> 20:14.733
>> HE'S VERY MELLOW.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.633
HE'S NOT THE SAME ANIMAL

20:15.700 --> 20:16.533
HE WOULD BE BECAUSE HE'S -- HE'S

20:16.600 --> 20:17.566
ADJUSTED, SHALL WE SAY, TO HUMAN

20:17.633 --> 20:18.033
LIFE.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.033
HAVING SOMETHING THAT NO ONE

20:19.100 --> 20:20.166
ELSE HAS GOT IS -- IS AN

20:20.233 --> 20:20.933
INTERESTING THING.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.066
>> John: I MEAN, SURE.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.766
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

20:24.833 --> 20:26.333
BUT EVEN IF YOU INSIST ON OWNING

20:26.400 --> 20:28.100
A WILD ANIMAL -- WHICH YOU

20:28.166 --> 20:29.466
REALLY SHOULDN'T -- WHY A

20:29.533 --> 20:29.933
CROCODILE?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.466
THEY'RE NOT REMOTELY CUDDLY.

20:31.533 --> 20:32.600
YOU'RE BASICALLY FLOODING YOUR

20:32.666 --> 20:34.200
BROOM CLOSET TO MAKE ROOM

20:34.266 --> 20:35.866
FOR A CARNIVOROUS SURFBOARD.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.000
THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE HUMAN USE

20:38.066 --> 20:40.066
FOR ANY CROCODILE OR ALLIGATOR

20:40.133 --> 20:41.766
IS AS THE STAR OF THE INTERNET'S

20:41.833 --> 20:43.266
GREATEST MUSIC VIDEO:

20:43.333 --> 20:45.033
♪ IT'S FLAT FUCK FRIDAY ♪

20:45.100 --> 20:49.366
♪ YOU FUCKIN' LOSERS ♪

20:49.433 --> 20:54.300
♪ IT'S FLAT FUCK FRIDAY ♪

20:54.366 --> 20:58.500
>> John: EXCELLENT.

20:58.566 --> 21:00.100
THAT IS EXCELLENT.

21:00.166 --> 21:03.333
THAT SONG IS CATCHIER THAN SARS

21:03.400 --> 21:04.366
IN A GOOD WAY.

21:04.433 --> 21:05.400
THE POINT IS, EXOTIC PET

21:05.466 --> 21:06.100
OWNERSHIP HAS CAUSED REAL

21:06.166 --> 21:06.933
PROBLEMS.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
IN 2003, 47 PEOPLE ACROSS SIX

21:08.066 --> 21:09.166
STATES CAUGHT MONKEYPOX --

21:09.233 --> 21:10.033
WHICH HAD NEVER INFECTED HUMANS

21:10.100 --> 21:11.166
OUTSIDE OF AFRICA -- AFTER

21:11.233 --> 21:12.733
HAVING CONTACT WITH INFECTED

21:12.800 --> 21:14.933
PRAIRIE DOGS PURCHASED AS PETS.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.633
AND IN 2006, PARIS HILTON HAD TO

21:16.700 --> 21:17.833
GO TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER HER

21:17.900 --> 21:20.066
KINKAJOU BIT HER.

21:20.133 --> 21:21.600
AND IT'S HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS

21:21.666 --> 21:23.166
WORSE: A U.S. MONKEYPOX

21:23.233 --> 21:24.300
OUTBREAK, OR BABYLUV'S SHOCKING

21:24.366 --> 21:25.266
BETRAYAL.

21:25.333 --> 21:28.600
ET TU, KINKAJOU?

21:28.666 --> 21:29.933
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS WAY

21:30.000 --> 21:31.100
WILD ANIMALS CAN SPREAD DISEASE

21:31.166 --> 21:32.466
TO HUMANS IS WHEN THEY'RE SOLD

21:32.533 --> 21:33.466
FOR CONSUMPTION.

21:33.533 --> 21:37.300
AND THE PHRASE YOU'RE PROBABLY

21:37.366 --> 21:38.533
ALREADY THINKING OF RIGHT NOW IS

21:38.600 --> 21:39.466
"WET MARKETS."

21:39.533 --> 21:40.366
LIKE THE ONE IN WUHAN, WHICH MAY

21:40.433 --> 21:41.433
WELL HAVE BEEN THE BREAKOUT SITE

21:41.500 --> 21:43.166
OF COVID-19.

21:43.233 --> 21:44.533
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW: THE TERM

21:44.600 --> 21:45.900
"WET MARKET" IS USED INCREDIBLY

21:45.966 --> 21:48.166
BROADLY AND OFTEN INCORRECTLY.

21:48.233 --> 21:49.000
MANY WET MARKETS ARE ESSENTIALLY

21:49.066 --> 21:51.200
JUST PLACES WHERE FRESH MEAT,

21:51.266 --> 21:52.266
SEAFOOD, AND PRODUCE ARE SOLD,

21:52.333 --> 21:54.266
NOT UNLIKE A FARMER'S MARKET.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.266
AND THEY CAN BE KEY SOURCES OF

21:55.333 --> 21:57.566
FRESH, AFFORDABLE FOOD AROUND

21:57.633 --> 21:58.800
THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN

21:58.866 --> 22:00.266
DEVELOPING AREAS WHERE THERE

22:00.333 --> 22:01.366
ISN'T, Y'KNOW, A TRADER JOE'S

22:01.433 --> 22:03.366
THREE BLOCKS AWAY.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.400
HOWEVER, SOME OF THOSE MARKETS

22:05.466 --> 22:06.733
DO SELL WILDLIFE LIKE BATS AND

22:06.800 --> 22:08.866
SNAKES AND CONDITIONS IN SOME OF

22:08.933 --> 22:10.000
THOSE WILDLIFE MARKETS CAN BE

22:10.066 --> 22:13.366
IDEAL FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION.

22:13.433 --> 22:17.100
>> SO HERE IN CAGES RIGHT NEXT

22:17.166 --> 22:18.866
TO EACH OTHER, WE'VE GOT ADULT

22:18.933 --> 22:20.300
RACCOONS NEXT TO CAPYBARA,

22:20.366 --> 22:22.033
WHICH IS FROM SOUTH AMERICA.

22:22.100 --> 22:22.833
THOSE ARE FROM NORTH AMERICA.

22:22.900 --> 22:23.766
CAGES RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

22:23.833 --> 22:24.366
THIS IS THE BIGGEST RODENT IN

22:24.433 --> 22:32.000
THE WORLD.

22:32.066 --> 22:34.533
AND ON TOP OF HERE, I THINK --

22:34.600 --> 22:35.033
MARMOSETS ON TOP OF THE

22:35.100 --> 22:37.066
CAPYBARA.

22:37.133 --> 22:37.833
>> WHAT WE JUST SAW HERE IS LIKE

22:37.900 --> 22:39.933
A BIOLOGICAL WARFARE LAB.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.633
ANY ONE ANIMAL CAN TRANSMIT

22:41.700 --> 22:43.066
A PATHOGEN TO ANOTHER, SOMEBODY

22:43.133 --> 22:44.500
BUYS IT, HANDLES IT, TAKES IT

22:44.566 --> 22:46.333
HOME AS A PET OR EATS IT.

22:46.400 --> 22:46.533
BOOM.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.833
WE HAVE ANOTHER PANDEMIC.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.633
>> John: RIGHT.

22:50.700 --> 22:51.800
WHEN WILD ANIMALS FROM DIFFERENT

22:51.866 --> 22:53.433
PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE HELD IN

22:53.500 --> 22:54.466
CLOSE PROXIMITY, WITH WEAKENED

22:54.533 --> 22:56.033
IMMUNE SYSTEMS DUE TO STRESS,

22:56.100 --> 22:57.900
PATHOGENS CAN EASILY JUMP FROM

22:57.966 --> 22:59.100
ONE SPECIES TO ANOTHER, AND

22:59.166 --> 23:00.700
POTENTIALLY TO HUMANS.

23:00.766 --> 23:02.466
WHICH SHOULD, AT THE VERY LEAST,

23:02.533 --> 23:04.433
MAKE YOU SERIOUSLY RETHINK YOUR

23:04.500 --> 23:07.200
ISLAND IN "ANIMAL CROSSING."

23:07.266 --> 23:08.500
YOU HONESTLY THINK IT'S STILL

23:08.566 --> 23:09.600
A GOOD IDEA TO LIVE IN CLOSE

23:09.666 --> 23:10.166
PROXIMITY WITH A RACCOON,

23:10.233 --> 23:11.300
AN OWL, A GORILLA, A TIGER,

23:11.366 --> 23:12.833
A SHEEP, A KOALA, AN OCTOPUS,

23:12.900 --> 23:16.000
A HAMSTER, A PENGUIN, A RHINO,

23:16.066 --> 23:17.700
AND A CHICKEN NAMED GOOSE, ALL

23:17.766 --> 23:18.566
OF WHOM TRAVELED THERE FROM

23:18.633 --> 23:20.266
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD?

23:20.333 --> 23:22.066
THAT'S NOT AN ISLAND PARADISE --

23:22.133 --> 23:22.700
IT'S A DISEASE CHERNOBYL WAITING

23:22.766 --> 23:25.300
TO HAPPEN.

23:25.366 --> 23:27.100
SHUT THAT SHIT DOWN!

23:27.166 --> 23:28.566
AND LISTEN, I KNOW IT DOESN'T

23:28.633 --> 23:30.066
SOUND GREAT WHENEVER SOMEONE,

23:30.133 --> 23:31.066
PARTICULARLY WITH THIS ACCENT,

23:31.133 --> 23:32.800
STARTS TUT-TUTTING ABOUT HOW

23:32.866 --> 23:33.900
PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES FEED

23:33.966 --> 23:35.766
THEMSELVES AND MAKE A LIVING.

23:35.833 --> 23:37.866
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, BEFORE

23:37.933 --> 23:40.133
WE GO TELL EVERYONE ELSE WHAT TO

23:40.200 --> 23:41.866
DO, WE MIGHT WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

23:41.933 --> 23:42.800
THAT OUR TRACK RECORD ON MIXING

23:42.866 --> 23:45.733
ANIMALS ISN'T GREAT, EITHER.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.700
ONE EXPERT THAT WE SPOKE TO SAID

23:46.766 --> 23:47.566
A MAJOR CONCERN OF THEIRS IS

23:47.633 --> 23:50.400
STATE FAIRS.

23:50.466 --> 23:51.266
WHICH DOES KIND OF MAKE SENSE.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.533
STATE AND AGRICULTURAL FAIRS

23:52.600 --> 23:53.333
HAVE BEEN LINKED TO MULTIPLE

23:53.400 --> 23:54.833
DISEASE OUTBREAKS, WITH ONE

23:54.900 --> 23:57.700
IN 2012 THAT INFECTED OVER

23:57.766 --> 24:01.000
300 PEOPLE -- MOSTLY CHILDREN --

24:01.066 --> 24:02.266
ACROSS 10 STATES.

24:02.333 --> 24:02.933
THAT PROBABLY EXPLAINS WHY

24:03.000 --> 24:03.833
FAIRGOERS HAVE BEEN

24:03.900 --> 24:04.833
REPEATEDLY WARNED,

24:04.900 --> 24:06.100
"NO KISSING PIGS!"

24:06.166 --> 24:08.666
AND LOOK, IT'S EASY TO THINK,

24:08.733 --> 24:09.900
"COME ON, I'D NEVER KISS A PIG,"

24:09.966 --> 24:10.900
BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

24:10.966 --> 24:11.866
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

24:11.933 --> 24:12.700
NOT YOU'RE SO SURE NOW, ARE YOU?

24:12.766 --> 24:14.500
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?

24:14.566 --> 24:15.800
NOW YOU'RE EVEN MORE CONFUSED.

24:15.866 --> 24:20.366
AND HOW ABOUT THIS PIG?

24:20.433 --> 24:23.366
EXACTLY, I THOUGHT SO.

24:23.433 --> 24:24.933
I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS: THIS HOT

24:25.000 --> 24:26.700
LITTLE PORK CHOP'S BEEN WATCHING

24:26.766 --> 24:27.266
YOU FROM ACROSS THE BAR ALL

24:27.333 --> 24:27.833
NIGHT.

24:27.900 --> 24:28.533
IT IS DOWN FOR SOME STUFF.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.500
AND AMERICA'S ACTUALLY

24:29.566 --> 24:30.533
GROUND ZERO FOR ANOTHER

24:30.600 --> 24:31.066
DANGEROUS PRACTICE:

24:31.133 --> 24:31.900
FACTORY FARMING.

24:31.966 --> 24:34.533
IT'S SOMETHING THAT STARTED

24:34.600 --> 24:35.400
HERE, BUT HAS SINCE SKYROCKETED

24:35.466 --> 24:36.466
AROUND THE WORLD, TO THE POINT

24:36.533 --> 24:37.366
THAT FACTORY FARMS NOW SUPPLY

24:37.433 --> 24:40.200
MORE THAN 90% OF MEAT GLOBALLY

24:40.266 --> 24:43.000
AND 99% OF MEAT DOMESTICALLY.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.200
IN FACTORY FARMS, LIVESTOCK ARE

24:44.266 --> 24:47.066
BRED AND CONFINED IN WAYS THAT

24:47.133 --> 24:47.633
CAN ENABLE VIRUSES TO SPREAD

24:47.700 --> 24:49.166
AMONG THEM MUCH MORE EASILY.

24:49.233 --> 24:51.166
>> WE HAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND HOGS

24:51.233 --> 24:53.066
PACKED IN TOGETHER AND THEY'RE

24:53.133 --> 24:54.000
ALL GENETICALLY LARGELY THE

24:54.066 --> 24:54.800
SAME.

24:54.866 --> 24:56.233
THAT SELECTS FOR THE MOST

24:56.300 --> 24:57.266
VIRULENT PATHOGENS THAT ARE

24:57.333 --> 24:58.466
POSSIBLE.

24:58.533 --> 24:59.966
AND SO, IN THE COURSE OF

25:00.033 --> 25:01.066
INDUSTRIALIZING LIVESTOCK

25:01.133 --> 25:03.133
PRODUCTION, WE ARE ALSO

25:03.200 --> 25:05.466
INDUSTRIALIZING THE PATHOGENS

25:05.533 --> 25:06.600
THAT CIRCULATE AMONG THEM.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.133
>> John: EXACTLY.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.766
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,

25:09.833 --> 25:10.766
BUT THE COLD, MECHANIZED

25:10.833 --> 25:11.966
FACTORIES THAT CRAM ANIMALS

25:12.033 --> 25:12.900
TOGETHER BEFORE STAMPING THEIR

25:12.966 --> 25:14.200
FLESH INTO PLASTIC MEAT-MOLDS

25:14.266 --> 25:15.133
AND EJECTING THE OUTCOME INTO

25:15.200 --> 25:16.400
SUPERMARKET FREEZER SECTIONS

25:16.466 --> 25:17.566
ACROSS THE NATION MIGHT BE DOING

25:17.633 --> 25:23.033
SOMETHING BAD.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.433
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

25:24.500 --> 25:25.333
TOGETHER, IT DOES BEGIN TO SEEM

25:25.400 --> 25:26.300
LIKE WE'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO

25:26.366 --> 25:27.100
START PANDEMICS.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.266
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE OBVIOUS

25:28.333 --> 25:28.966
QUESTION: HOW DO WE STOP DOING

25:29.033 --> 25:31.066
THAT?

25:31.133 --> 25:32.433
WELL, THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

25:32.500 --> 25:33.366
WOULD BE TO CLOSE DOWN ALL

25:33.433 --> 25:34.033
WILDLIFE MARKETS,

25:34.100 --> 25:37.166
BAN FACTORY FARMING,

25:37.233 --> 25:38.233
STOP EATING MEAT ALTOGETHER,

25:38.300 --> 25:39.266
HALT DEFORESTATION, SHUT DOWN

25:39.333 --> 25:40.366
ALL STATE FAIRS, AND DEFINITELY

25:40.433 --> 25:41.400
TAKE AWAY PARIS HILTON'S

25:41.466 --> 25:42.333
KINKAJOU.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.166
BUT OBVIOUSLY, NONE OF THOSE ARE

25:43.233 --> 25:44.500
GOING TO HAPPEN.

25:44.566 --> 25:45.500
FOR ONE THING, WE KNOW THAT

25:45.566 --> 25:47.566
KINKAJOU BITES.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.300
BUT ALSO, DRACONIAN MEASURES ARE

25:49.366 --> 25:50.433
JUST NOT GOING TO WORK HERE.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.000
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU ABOLISH

25:52.066 --> 25:54.133
WILDLIFE MARKETS, THAT COULD

25:54.200 --> 25:55.600
CAUSE FOOD SCARCITY, AND WOULD

25:55.666 --> 25:56.866
LIKELY JUST LEAD TO AN EXPLOSION

25:56.933 --> 25:57.600
IN BLACK MARKET TRADE OF

25:57.666 --> 25:58.466
WILD ANIMALS.

25:58.533 --> 26:00.333
THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS,

26:00.400 --> 26:01.700
THAT'S REPORTEDLY WHAT HAPPENED

26:01.766 --> 26:03.166
WHEN CHINA ATTEMPTED JUST SUCH

26:03.233 --> 26:04.533
A BAN IN 2003, IN RESPONSE TO

26:04.600 --> 26:05.766
SARS.

26:05.833 --> 26:06.800
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE

26:06.866 --> 26:08.300
SHOULDN'T TRY TO REDUCE HARMFUL

26:08.366 --> 26:11.333
PRACTICES -- BECAUSE WE SHOULD.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.333
MANY EXPERTS ARGUE FOR WHAT'S

26:13.400 --> 26:16.400
CALLED A "ONE HEALTH"

26:16.466 --> 26:20.166
PERSPECTIVE, WHERE WE

26:20.233 --> 26:22.766
RECOGNIZE THAT THE HEALTH OF

26:22.833 --> 26:24.733
HUMANS, ANIMALS, ENVIRONMENT,

26:24.800 --> 26:26.633
ARE ALL CONNECTED, AND TAKE THAT

26:26.700 --> 26:26.933
INTO ACCOUNT

26:27.000 --> 26:27.533
WHEN MAKING

26:27.600 --> 26:28.666
DECISIONS ON EVERYTHING FROM

26:28.733 --> 26:29.233
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS TO

26:29.300 --> 26:30.066
URBAN PLANNING.

26:30.133 --> 26:31.566
AND THERE ARE GOING TO NEED TO

26:31.633 --> 26:32.300
BE LOTS OF SMALLER SOLUTIONS,

26:32.366 --> 26:33.300
TOO, WHICH WILL LOOK DIFFERENT

26:33.366 --> 26:33.966
EVERYWHERE, BECAUSE, CRUCIALLY,

26:34.033 --> 26:34.933
EVERYWHERE IS DIFFERENT.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.066
TAKE THAILAND.

26:36.133 --> 26:37.066
THEY'VE HAD SOME REAL SUCCESS

26:37.133 --> 26:38.366
IN PREVENTING OUTBREAKS THERE BY

26:38.433 --> 26:39.200
PROVIDING FARMERS WITH

26:39.266 --> 26:40.033
A PHONE APP TO FLAG ANY PROBLEMS

26:40.100 --> 26:41.933
THAT THEY SEE.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.333
>> IT'S SIMILAR TO A POOR MAN'S

26:44.400 --> 26:46.433
INSTAGRAM WITHOUT ANY FILTERS,

26:46.500 --> 26:50.233
THAT HELPS THE VOLUNTEERS IN THE

26:50.300 --> 26:51.666
VILLAGE TO SUBMIT ABNORMAL

26:51.733 --> 26:54.466
HEALTH EVENTS IN REAL TIME.

26:54.533 --> 26:56.433
>> YOU COULDN'T TRAIN EVERYONE

26:56.500 --> 26:58.333
TO BE A HEALTH EXPERT BUT YOU

26:58.400 --> 26:59.066
CAN TRAIN EVERYONE TO BE EYES

26:59.133 --> 27:03.800
AND EARS.

27:03.866 --> 27:04.966
>> John: THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

27:05.033 --> 27:05.866
BECAUSE WITH THAT APP, FARMERS

27:05.933 --> 27:06.666
THERE HAVE A WAY TO SPOT A

27:06.733 --> 27:07.733
POSSIBLY SICK BIRD THAT COULD

27:07.800 --> 27:10.133
INFORM BROADER PUBLIC POLICY.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.200
WHICH ISN'T JUST EFFECTIVE

27:12.266 --> 27:14.866
DISEASE PREVENTION, IT WAS ALSO

27:14.933 --> 27:16.200
INTERESTINGLY THE WORKING TITLE

27:16.266 --> 27:16.966
OF THIS SHOW.

27:17.033 --> 27:17.766
THAT SCHEME HAS BEEN A SUCCESS,

27:17.833 --> 27:18.733
PARTLY BECAUSE IT PRESERVES

27:18.800 --> 27:19.900
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS, AND ALIGNS

27:19.966 --> 27:21.333
FARMERS' INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF

27:21.400 --> 27:24.966
THEIR LARGER COMMUNITY.

27:25.033 --> 27:26.933
AND THERE WILL BE THOUSANDS OF

27:27.000 --> 27:27.700
SMALL IDEAS LIKE THAT, THAT

27:27.766 --> 27:28.533
COULD END UP MAKING A REAL

27:28.600 --> 27:29.400
DIFFERENCE.

27:29.466 --> 27:30.700
AND LOOK, THERE'S NO DENYING

27:30.766 --> 27:31.866
ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO COST

27:31.933 --> 27:32.366
MONEY.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.500
AND UNFORTUNATELY, SOME

27:33.566 --> 27:34.433
SCIENTISTS DOUBT OUR APPETITE

27:34.500 --> 27:36.133
FOR LONG-TERM SPENDING ON THIS.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.533
JUST LISTEN TO THIS RESEARCHER

27:39.600 --> 27:41.533
IN BRAZIL MAKE THAT EXACT POINT,

27:41.600 --> 27:42.266
WHILE TAKING SAMPLES FROM BATS.

27:42.333 --> 27:43.733
>> IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO

27:43.800 --> 27:44.933
GET FUNDING FOR OUR KIND OF

27:45.000 --> 27:47.300
RESEARCH.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.500
NOW, DURING THE PANDEMIC, IT HAS

27:48.566 --> 27:52.466
BEEN A LITTLE EASIER.

27:52.533 --> 27:55.200
BUT AS SOON AS THE VIRUS CRISIS

27:55.266 --> 27:56.533
IS OVER, OUR FINANCIAL WORRIES

27:56.600 --> 27:58.700
WILL RETURN.

27:58.766 --> 28:00.400
I'M NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC.

28:00.466 --> 28:05.033
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.366
"I'M NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC" ISN'T

28:06.433 --> 28:07.733
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM

28:07.800 --> 28:08.500
SOMEONE SCRAPING GERMS OUT OF A

28:08.566 --> 28:08.966
BAT.

28:09.033 --> 28:10.533
THAT'S A WOMAN WHO LITERALLY

28:10.600 --> 28:11.300
KNOWS HER SHIT.

28:11.366 --> 28:12.700
SO WE NEED TO SPEND HOWEVER MUCH

28:12.766 --> 28:13.600
IS NECESSARY TO CHANGE HER

28:13.666 --> 28:17.966
ANSWER.

28:18.033 --> 28:19.433
AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS WILL BE

28:19.500 --> 28:20.633
CHEAP; ONE ESTIMATE FOR THE

28:20.700 --> 28:21.366
COST OF GLOBAL PREVENTION RUNS

28:21.433 --> 28:22.300
BETWEEN $22 AND $31 BILLION

28:22.366 --> 28:23.066
A YEAR.

28:23.133 --> 28:26.600
BUT BEAR IN MIND,

28:26.666 --> 28:27.966
EVEN IF IT WAS DOUBLE THAT,

28:28.033 --> 28:29.100
THE COST OF COVID-19 IN THE U.S.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.066
ALONE IS ESTIMATED TO BE OVER

28:30.133 --> 28:31.500
$16 TRILLION.

28:31.566 --> 28:33.133
SO, TO PUT IT MILDLY, IT'S

28:33.200 --> 28:34.566
FUCKING WORTH IT.

28:34.633 --> 28:36.433
AND I KNOW, RIGHT NOW, THAT

28:36.500 --> 28:38.600
MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.233
THE PROBLEM IS, AS WE COME OUT

28:40.300 --> 28:42.533
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS PANDEMIC,

28:42.600 --> 28:43.833
THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT

28:43.900 --> 28:45.233
WE'RE GOING TO START TO GET

28:45.300 --> 28:45.533
COMPLACENT.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.400
SO FOR THE GOOD OF FUTURE

28:46.466 --> 28:47.433
GENERATIONS -- AND IN ALL

28:47.500 --> 28:49.866
LIKELIHOOD, US IN A FEW YEARS --

28:49.933 --> 28:51.466
WE REALLY NEED TO REMEMBER THE

28:51.533 --> 28:53.466
WAY WE FEEL RIGHT NOW AND INVEST

28:53.533 --> 28:54.233
ACCORDINGLY.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.600
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, YOU NEVER

28:55.666 --> 28:57.766
KNOW WHERE THE NEXT PANDEMIC IS

28:57.833 --> 28:58.266
GOING TO COME FROM.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.266
>> HEY, Y'ALL!

28:59.333 --> 29:00.266
REMEMBER ME?

29:00.333 --> 29:01.733
I'M BACK!

29:01.800 --> 29:03.266
AND I'M GONNA DO WHAT THE

29:03.333 --> 29:05.266
CORONAVIRUS COULDN'T:

29:05.333 --> 29:06.966
I'M GONNA KILL TOM HANKS!

29:07.033 --> 29:08.200
>> John: PLEASE DON'T DO THAT,

29:08.266 --> 29:08.933
VIRUS!

29:09.000 --> 29:10.466
>> RITA WILSON, TOO!

29:10.533 --> 29:11.633
THEY'RE GONNA CALL ME OLIVER'S

29:11.700 --> 29:13.400
PLAGUE!

29:13.466 --> 29:14.666
>> John: I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU

29:14.733 --> 29:16.200
TO BE CALLED THAT.

29:16.266 --> 29:16.966
>> OH, I THINK IT'S GOT A RING

29:17.033 --> 29:19.400
TO IT!

29:19.466 --> 29:22.100
>> John: I ABSOLUTELY DON'T.

29:22.166 --> 29:22.866
THE POINT IS, WE HAVE GOT TO

29:22.933 --> 29:23.566
REMEMBER THIS FEELING.

29:23.633 --> 29:24.033
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.866
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:25.933 --> 29:26.700
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING,

29:26.766 --> 29:27.333
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK,

29:27.400 --> 29:29.933
GOOD NIGHT.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
>> OOH, JOHN, DO YOU THINK A

29:31.066 --> 29:31.800
BUNCH OF CELEBRITIES WILL MAKE

29:31.866 --> 29:32.666
A VIDEO OF THEMSELVES SINGING

29:32.733 --> 29:33.266
"IMAGINE" WHEN I FIRST BREAK

29:33.333 --> 29:37.733
OUT?

29:37.800 --> 29:38.233
>> John: PROBABLY, TO BE

29:38.300 --> 29:40.033
HONEST.

29:40.100 --> 29:43.833
>> I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU!

29:43.900 --> 29:44.300
>> John: WHAT IS YOUR

29:44.366 --> 29:45.433
SURPRISE?

29:45.500 --> 29:49.100
>> I CAN SPREAD THROUGH ZOOM!

29:49.166 --> 29:50.700
>> John: HOW CAN YOU SPREAD

29:50.766 --> 29:51.100
THROUGH ZOOM?

29:51.166 --> 29:52.166
>> NATURE'S FULL OF MIRACLES!

29:52.233 --> 29:53.033
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

29:53.100 --> 29:53.766
I'M GOIN' TO DISNEYWORLD!

29:53.833 --> 29:54.833
I'M GONNA GIVE EVERYONE BLOODY
