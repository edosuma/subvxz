Have you ever
done something stupid?

00:25.442 --> 00:27.729
No, I mean really stupid.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.234
Stupid to the point where you and
your friends are being shot at?

00:32.908 --> 00:35.901
This is the craziest thing
you've ever done to us!

00:36.119 --> 00:38.281
Who the fuck is the crazy bitch
shootin' at us?!

00:38.497 --> 00:40.329
Oh, that's
Juan Garcia's daughter.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.929
- We're in love.
- Well, then text the bitch

00:44.127 --> 00:45.993
and tell her to quit
fucking shooting at us!

00:46.213 --> 00:49.206
What could possibly lead
these three best of friends

00:49.424 --> 00:51.757
to brave the face of death?

00:51.969 --> 00:53.631
Money, of course.

00:53.845 --> 00:57.259
♪ California
knows how to party

00:57.474 --> 00:58.474
♪ Shake it down

00:58.559 --> 01:00.016
♪ California

01:00.227 --> 01:02.685
♪ Knows how to party...

01:02.896 --> 01:04.808
Even as children,
little Vincent

01:05.022 --> 01:08.391
was always concocting some sort
of get-rich-quick scheme.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.273
Man, I don't know how I let you
talk me into this.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.354
- Oh, please.
- I'm serious.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.987
I'm black, Vincent,
or did you somehow forget that

01:16.201 --> 01:17.908
when you came up
with this brilliant plan?

01:18.120 --> 01:20.362
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

01:20.581 --> 01:23.574
What? Man, we try to return
that cat and get the reward,

01:23.792 --> 01:25.912
you know the first thing
old Miss Womack's gonna think

01:25.961 --> 01:28.499
is, "I bet it was this little
nigga that stole it."

01:28.714 --> 01:30.046
She wouldn't say that.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.964
Shut up, Kurt!

01:32.175 --> 01:33.837
Vincent convinced Chris

01:34.052 --> 01:35.634
that he would not be
singled out

01:35.846 --> 01:37.587
just because he was black.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.967
My baby!

01:39.182 --> 01:40.673
Why is he in a bag?

01:40.892 --> 01:43.100
This was the eighties,
and everyone knew

01:43.312 --> 01:45.850
that racism no longer
existed in America.

01:46.064 --> 01:50.058
There you go, boys, $40,
just like the reward says.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.111
Um, there's something
that's a little odd.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.030
Mr. Wiggles has always been
an indoor kitty...

01:56.241 --> 01:57.948
so I can't imagine

01:58.160 --> 02:01.028
how he got out.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.908
Christopher?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.740
You or any of your brothers,
did you leave a door open

02:05.959 --> 02:07.621
when you were
cleaning out my garage?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.828
Ms. Womack,
that was two years ago

02:10.047 --> 02:11.333
you had us clean out
your garage.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.148
Your cat's only been missing
three weeks.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.466
That's neither fish nor fowl.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.339
I told you,
just 'cause I was black,

02:17.554 --> 02:19.554
I was gonna get blamed.
I should kill you, Vincent.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.967
Whatever,
look at all this money.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.345
Man, one day we will have
a black president,

02:23.518 --> 02:26.807
and he will make sure all black people
are taken care of, you best believe that.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.059
Not a chance.
Boys, you stick with me,

02:29.274 --> 02:31.937
and you'll definitely share in the wealth,
'cause I'm gonna be rich.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.064
'Cause I'm gonna be rich.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.317
Why am I reciting
this great modern tale

02:37.532 --> 02:39.194
in which legends were made?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.366
Because someone paid me.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.195
So shut up
and pay close attention.

02:48.418 --> 02:52.378
Never as a child prophesize
about your future wealth,

02:52.589 --> 02:56.208
because you end up sleeping on
your friend's pleather couch.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.675
Who is it?

03:07.396 --> 03:09.137
Christopher Jefferson Johnson?

03:09.356 --> 03:12.224
Hey, who is that using
my government name?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.308
Think it's Walter, man.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.736
He's dressed like
he's going to church.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.737
And you're sweaty, Walter.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.407
What up, Walt?

03:22.619 --> 03:26.488
Uh, Mr. Johnson,
you are hereby served.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.369
Serving what?
What are you serving?

03:28.583 --> 03:31.041
Goddamn it,
I'm sorry, man, look...

03:31.253 --> 03:33.119
My stupid brother-in-law
got me this job

03:33.338 --> 03:34.874
as a process server.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.083
She's tagging along with me
all damn day, and...

03:38.301 --> 03:40.088
I'm scared as hell out here!

03:40.262 --> 03:41.423
I'm real sorry, Chris.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.721
Divorce sucks.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.424
I'm glad it's not me.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.602
Walter, I'm waiting!

03:49.813 --> 03:52.521
OK, actually, I wish it was me.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.395
Get the fuck away
from my house, man.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.225
Come up here and serving me.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.548
You can't even take care of
that fucking bitch out there,

03:58.572 --> 04:01.280
gotta ride around in a car with
rollers all over her goddamn head.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.608
What the fuck you doing
with that monkey suit on?

04:03.827 --> 04:04.943
Sorry, Chris.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.448
You're very sweaty, Walter.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.497
Thanks, man.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.451
Oh, we still on for poker
on Wednesday night?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.160
Yes, Walter.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.495
Yes!

04:16.714 --> 04:18.422
I'll bring the pizza, you guys.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.250
Fuckin' bitch.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.837
You shouldn't start
your day like this.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.388
Man, you've been sitting here
living on my couch

04:26.600 --> 04:30.184
since October 15,
five motherfucking years ago.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.308
I can count that.
I get it.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.391
You need to come to grips
with this, uh, reality

04:36.610 --> 04:38.602
that you're not that good
a salesman, man.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.403
Man, you're talking
about my career.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.107
Your career is fucked up.
What is it this week, man?

04:44.326 --> 04:45.658
Upright Breathe-Right.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.656
Up-breathin' what?
Breathe what? Who?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.703
You know what,
I'm proud of what I do.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.998
It's the Upright Breathe-Right.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.792
It is a vacuum cleaner,
is what the fuck it is.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.040
Man, millionaires don't get
like this overnight.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.963
I'm trying to do
what I need to do, OK?

05:00.175 --> 05:02.417
I'm going to work
to make my millions.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.047
Watch when I come home today.

05:04.262 --> 05:08.427
I got a real job, I fix motors.
People need to drive.

05:08.642 --> 05:13.262
You need to fix your drive,
your drive in life, Chris.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.190
While Vincent and Chris toiled to
make a dollar out of 50 cents,

05:17.400 --> 05:21.110
Kurt was actually quite wealthy
working for his father-in-law,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.563
and miserable to boot.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.570
Oh! What are you doing?
You're supposed to be in there.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.026
Yeah, I'm trying.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.032
I can't find
my transportation form.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.489
Fuck, you look like hell.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.290
Did you sleep last night?

05:35.502 --> 05:36.743
Little, uh, wacky-wacky?

05:36.962 --> 05:39.124
Thanks, thanks, Rick.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.205
It's exactly what I needed
right now.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.383
Aaah, just glad it's you
and not me, man.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.005
I don't think I could do it.

05:46.221 --> 05:49.464
Do what?
You gave the last presentation.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.050
Yeah, and I fucking killed
that bitch.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.852
No, I'm talking
about being the son-in-law

05:55.063 --> 05:56.270
of the CEO.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.938
Hello!

05:58.149 --> 05:59.310
Uh-uh-uh-uh! Pfft!

05:59.526 --> 06:01.438
Please.

06:01.653 --> 06:06.648
You are about to present
to the biggest potential client

06:06.867 --> 06:08.449
this firm has ever seen.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.744
And your father-in-law,
slasher-balls,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.538
is gonna be sitting
right there, same room,

06:14.749 --> 06:16.035
analyzing your every move.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.666
Kurt.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.588
Kurtie?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.587
Dude! Hey! Snap out of it.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.088
Yo!

06:27.304 --> 06:29.341
What? What did you say?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.924
Fix your hair first.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.011
Oh, and your secretary
always stares at my bulge.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.647
See you in the trenches.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.438
Two minutes.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.238
Breathe.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.321
Just a panic attack.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.826
I have several hundred
of these a month.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.164
You can do this!
You can do this!

07:03.548 --> 07:07.337
Mr. Pomeroy,
it's your wife on line one.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.636
Um... put her through.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.008
OK.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.552
Hello, darling.
I won't keep you.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.291
I just Wanted to tell you how
important this meeting is to daddy.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.481
I know.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.274
Well, I'm not sure you do.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.024
Takanaki Industries is a client
daddy's tried to get for years,

07:27.238 --> 07:29.901
and it would be unfortunate
if you lost this opportunity.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.029
I'm the reason Takanaki
Industries is even here today.

07:33.244 --> 07:37.204
Three years of traveling back and
forth from Japan, and I got it done.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.748
I would think that you
would be calling me,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.872
your husband, to say,
"Good luck!"

07:42.087 --> 07:43.294
Hah. That's cute, honey.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.088
Just keep your eye
on the ball.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.540
Remember that

07:47.759 --> 07:49.796
it's all on your shoulders.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.048

Hi.

08:28.758 --> 08:32.297
Hi. Wow, you're hot...
Oh, hi, I'm Vincent Bolero

08:32.511 --> 08:34.720
with the Upright Breathe-Right,
and you have been chosen

08:34.931 --> 08:37.844
from thousands of participants
to receive a...

08:38.058 --> 08:40.722
You got... Is it hot?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.929
Actually, my parents,
they just bought me a vacuum

08:43.148 --> 08:45.231
right before the semester started,
so I'm all good.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.525
Hold on,
just give me one second.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.353
They gave me a rebuttal
for that... the pamphlet.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.772
Hand 'em the pamphlet here.
That has all the information.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.358
- I have company.
- Oh, hey, hi, guys.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.868
What you doing, just chillin'?
I used to chill.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.241
Let me tell ya, um...

09:00.457 --> 09:02.073
Ha, I know what that is.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.039
That's not a asthma breather,
is it?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.335
You guys!

09:11.051 --> 09:13.509
- All right, so...
- No, you can't have any.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.531
And my parents give me
an allowance every month

09:15.555 --> 09:17.717
which is not enough to afford
this amazing vacuum,

09:17.932 --> 09:20.390
so I couldn't even buy one
if I wanted to, thank you.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.303
That leads me to the other part
of my whole presentation.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.012
Making money. You, sir.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.565
How would you like to make
$10,000 a month?

09:28.777 --> 09:32.020
Wait, so you
make $10,000 a month?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.820
Dressed like that?

09:34.032 --> 09:38.151
Um, I don't. My boss does.
And then the guy above him.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.531
At the office,
it's like a tower, OK?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.535
They have like,
you have the level one...

09:43.750 --> 09:46.788
It's like a pyramid.
They don't think of it like a pyramid.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.710
They say don't say
it's a pyramid.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.538
It's better looking at it
on the board,

09:50.757 --> 09:54.171
but yes, you can, you can make
that kind of money.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.752
It's like he's an anchor
on the Sad News Network

09:56.971 --> 09:58.712
and the special is
"My Life Sucks."

09:58.932 --> 10:01.845
I'm gonna dump this right here.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.552
No, you're not, whoa!
Dude! Oh, my God!

10:04.771 --> 10:07.980
Be cool, man. It's from the vacuum company.
They give me this stuff.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.649
Whoa, hold on, Vince, is it?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.476
Is this really your job?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.857
Like, you just bust on in here,

10:15.073 --> 10:16.780
dump dirt and shit
all over the floor

10:16.991 --> 10:18.983
and tell me I can
make more money than you do?

10:19.202 --> 10:21.319
I get it.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.996
I'm the guy being laughed at
in the room, right?

10:24.207 --> 10:26.039
It's not like
there's much difference

10:26.251 --> 10:28.584
between you and this pile
of dirt right now.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.001
This is not very, um...

10:33.216 --> 10:34.457
uh...

10:34.676 --> 10:37.714
There's, uh, you can have it.
I'm sorry.

10:37.929 --> 10:41.297
No! What? Take it?
You're not gonna clean this up?

10:41.516 --> 10:45.226
The vacuum works, so they say.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.723
Wow! Oh, my God.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.909
Look, man, when I tell you to go get us
some coffee, don't put cream in my shit.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.578
Black people
like our shit black!

11:04.789 --> 11:07.749
Christopher Jefferson Johnson,
you ain't playin' no more damn games with me!

11:09.586 --> 11:12.420
You can wallow that fat ass
right on back out that door.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.998
- You can wallow your ass if you don't sign these divorce papers.
- Bitch, please.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.506
I'm warning you, Chris, you're
not gonna mess this up for me.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.212
He's a real man.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.514
He's the next nigga.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.591
Fuck you lookin' at?
Get your ass to work!

11:25.810 --> 11:27.746
Affirmative action, that's
why I hired your honky ass!

11:27.770 --> 11:29.102
Get, get, get!

11:29.314 --> 11:31.897
Now, look here, you think
you're gonna get knocked up

11:32.108 --> 11:34.896
by this rich motherfucker then
try to get a divorce from me

11:35.111 --> 11:37.854
so you can run off and get paid
and get married and shit?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.938
It ain't goin' down
like that, baby.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.071
Oh, you gonna give me a divorce,
you best believe that.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.529
You got an envelope,
I got an envelope.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.286
In this envelope
is a picture of you,

11:49.500 --> 11:53.870
buckin' my brother,
Jerome Jefferson Johnson III,

11:54.047 --> 11:56.755
and a neighbor,
and the motherfucker across the street.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.253
The mailman!
There's a picture of you in here

11:59.469 --> 12:01.256
with peanut butter
on your left ass cheek

12:01.471 --> 12:03.884
with the dog licking it off,
I invented that!

12:06.226 --> 12:08.434
Now, you wanna get a divorce,

12:08.645 --> 12:11.388
you and your rich sugar daddy
gonna have to pay me.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.144
That's what it is.
Now, get the fuck out.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.602
- Get, rock, agitate the ground!
- Uggh!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.106
That's a waste of a good ass.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.786
Get to work!
Fuck you lookin' at?

12:27.997 --> 12:31.081
Take the tire off,
get the engine out the motherfucker,

12:31.292 --> 12:32.749
jump in it and drive,
kill yourself.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.497
Fuck you, too!
All you motherfuckers

12:34.712 --> 12:37.500
act like you ain't never had
a bitch fool around on you.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.082
I ain't the only one
up in this motherfucker.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.169
I quit, too, hah, bitches!

12:50.311 --> 12:51.677
Yes?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.137
Chris!

12:53.356 --> 12:54.972
Oh, my God, how are you?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.103
You know what,
I actually don't give a fuck.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.732
Please hold while I get the other half
of this shit sandwich on the line.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.361
- Hello?
- How are ya? You're on the phone with the Rickster.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.287
- Who the fuck is this?
- I said "the Rickster" the first time.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.536
- That's long for Rick.
- Who is Rick?

13:13.751 --> 13:15.583
It's Rick, for fuck sake.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.378
Chris, this is Rick the dick
from college.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.081
Why you callin', motherfucker?
We don't like you anyway.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.793
You still sporting that dick
broom on the top of your lip?

13:24.012 --> 13:27.505
Ha! Wow! Dick broom.
Still not funny.

13:27.724 --> 13:31.120
You better come up with better material when
you go visit your buddy at the funny farm.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.624
You're gonna need to lighten
the mood.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.771
- Rick, English, please.
- Your buddy Kurt

13:35.982 --> 13:38.440
completely bombed
in the boardroom.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.571
You know what, scratch that,
he didn't just bomb,

13:40.611 --> 13:42.523
that mo-fo kamikazed it.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.689
Aaah!

13:45.908 --> 13:47.615
Ooh, ah-soooo!

13:47.827 --> 13:49.614
Ohhhh!

13:49.829 --> 13:52.492
What the fuck are you dinks
making cars for anyhow?

13:52.707 --> 13:55.825
- You can't drive for shit!
- This is an outrage!

13:56.044 --> 13:59.162
- He fucking hates the Asians.
- Harro?

13:59.380 --> 14:01.497
Bring me some ramen noodles!

14:01.716 --> 14:04.299
He basically offended
everybody in the room.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.843
Mr. Horny,
rock-and-roll time!

14:07.055 --> 14:10.014
Then he stepped up
to his father-in-law/boss

14:10.224 --> 14:13.264
and let him know that he actually prefers
to cram it in his daughter's pooper.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.977
I had anal intercourse
with your daughter!

14:16.189 --> 14:18.602
You're finished, you hear me?!
You son of a bitch!

14:20.902 --> 14:23.645
Ah, romantic.
I got to tell ya,

14:23.863 --> 14:27.356
it was the singular greatest/worst
thing I have ever seen.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.445
Man, I ain't even
tryin' to hear this shit.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.743
Christopher, you may not be
trying to hear this,

14:31.954 --> 14:33.991
but, broheim, it is all true.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.285
Christopher...

14:36.501 --> 14:38.663
Vincent... never forget this.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.166
Cradle my balls.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.624
- Yeah, whatever.
- Go fuck yourself.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.967
Guess it can't get
any worse than this shit.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.136
Who took the last goddamn
roll of toilet paper!

15:01.943 --> 15:03.935
So, is this what life's
all about:

15:04.153 --> 15:07.146
infidelity, going crazy,
hopeless dreaming?

15:07.365 --> 15:08.697
Wait a minute,
hopeless dreaming?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.115
What?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.488
Vincent.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.819
Christopher?

15:14.038 --> 15:16.246
Fuckin' Chodewell?

15:16.457 --> 15:18.119
That's Chodewell.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.791
That is Chodewell!

15:20.002 --> 15:21.584
Do you remember him
in gym class?

15:21.796 --> 15:25.164
He had the little rib cage,
looked like a bird was in it?

15:25.383 --> 15:29.423
Yeah, but most adults actually
call me by my real name,

15:29.637 --> 15:31.128
Dr. Chadwell.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.463
What are you up to?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.176
'Cause, you know, you two

15:34.392 --> 15:37.135
were the most popular
guys in school.

15:37.353 --> 15:41.188
So, Vincent, right, you,
you must be a, what, CEO

15:41.399 --> 15:44.767
of a multinational
corporation by now,

15:44.986 --> 15:48.195
and, Christopher,
I can only imagine that you...

15:48.406 --> 15:51.319
you are playing professional
football for all these years,

15:51.534 --> 15:55.118
maybe for the Broncos,
am I right?

15:55.329 --> 15:57.821
No, you missed the mark
just a little bit.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.874
I'm actually broke and jobless.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.577
Chris's here's wife's pregnant
by another man's semen,

16:03.796 --> 16:05.253
and somewhere in this hospital,

16:05.465 --> 16:08.333
Kurt has lost his damn mind
with a mental breakdown.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.887
Holy shit! Wow, you guys.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.966
You are quite the success stories,
aren't you?

16:17.185 --> 16:20.223
Man, Christopher, I still
remember that game...

16:20.438 --> 16:22.680
- ...Armando Garcia...
- I was 19!

16:22.899 --> 16:25.107
- You were 22!
- I was 19!

16:25.318 --> 16:27.560
Mr. Garcia is
Colombia's biggest drug lord

16:27.778 --> 16:29.314
and the head
of the Garcia cartel,

16:29.530 --> 16:31.943
which is responsible
for smuggling tons

16:32.158 --> 16:34.866
of cocaine into
the United States each year.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.661
Mr. Robinson then issued
a $25 million reward

16:38.873 --> 16:40.910
out for the capture
of Mr. Garcia.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.367
The White House is expected
to hold a press conference

16:43.586 --> 16:46.704
to further add insight
to this newest development.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.631
In other news,
do you like cats?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.299
You know what, fuck you!

16:51.511 --> 16:54.470
Cho to hell, Chodewell!
Cho to hell!

16:54.680 --> 16:56.797
You gentlemen can see
Mr. Pomeroy now.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.350
He is pretty sedated, so I suggest
you keep your conversation brief.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.395
I'll be quiet.
I was just waiting...

17:03.606 --> 17:04.722
Come on, man.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.183
Uh-huh, yeah, no, that's right.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.776
God, Mom, I gotta go.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.857
Two vagrants just walked in.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.994
I'll have to call security and have
them thrown out on their asses.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.324
Uh-oh, Chris, you might want to
check the bottom of your shoes.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.660
I think one of us stepped
in a pile of bitch.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.246
Funny, Vincent. I'm not loaning you any
money, so you might as well take a hike.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.962
As if I would ever borrow
any money from you, Beth.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.965
What the hell does that mean?
We've supported your ass for years.

17:36.180 --> 17:40.174
Not to mention, you borrow money
from everyone you know, you scumbag.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.885
Don't even look at me, man,
I don't even like this bitch.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.096
But she got a point.
You owe me $700.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.647
What the hell is with
the baby balloons?

17:47.858 --> 17:50.191
They was on sale, he's a boy.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.923
- And it's the thought that counts, all right?
- You're an idiot.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.696
Chocolate?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.969
That's the last thing he needs,
more screw-ups in his life.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.905
He screwed up
for the last time with me.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.203
He's lucky that I'm
even here right now.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.155
He's in the room!

18:03.374 --> 18:05.536
He can't hear shit,
he looks like a freakin' vegetable,

18:05.751 --> 18:08.431
drool and shit coming out of his mouth...
this is fucking disgusting!

18:08.462 --> 18:10.294
And after what he pulled
with daddy today,

18:10.506 --> 18:13.214
I would say divorce is
in his slobbering-ass future.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.009
You know what, Brenda,
that is some coldblooded shit

18:16.220 --> 18:17.677
to say about your husband.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.848
My name is Bethany! Bethany!

18:22.059 --> 18:24.329
Tell your loser-ass friend
to get a good divorce attorney.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.845
The less I see
of any of you, the better.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.898
You know you want it.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.817
- Did she just leave him?
- Yeah.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.021
My man is cracked out.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.919
He ain't cracked out, it's all the
Valium they're pumping in his arm.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.026
Look, I don't know what
we're supposed to do,

18:40.244 --> 18:42.861
'cause obviously the crazy bitch
is not coming back.

18:43.080 --> 18:47.370
- All right, just let me think.
- Put your mind in gear, man.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.372
Look at you, Kurt.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.328
This is the moment
where Vincent

18:51.547 --> 18:54.881
saw his opportunity
to be rich and famous.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.084
- That's it.
- Pissin' out his mouth, man.

18:57.303 --> 19:01.092
Whatever, man, fuck him. We gotta go
on vacation, man. We need a vacation.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.970
- What?
- A vacation from our lives.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.598
So this I where I drink
the Kool-Aid, right,

19:06.812 --> 19:09.350
go to this little island
and then die?

19:09.523 --> 19:11.230
No, I'm not talking
about suicide, man,

19:11.442 --> 19:13.604
I'm talking about getting
the hell out of the country.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.526
You broke and I got a j-o-b.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.855
And your job sucks.
You're in a fuckin' onesie.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.111
I'm in a dickey:
that's where my dick go.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.283
Look, man, I'm broke
but he's not,

19:22.495 --> 19:23.906
and they're still married.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.784
Credit cards,
you know what I'm saying?

19:26.957 --> 19:31.543
Bump the bitch credit card. Come on, let's
get this crazy motherfucker out of here.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.425
Ooh!

19:39.637 --> 19:42.880
Mr. Chodewell!

19:43.099 --> 19:45.011
Grow up!

19:47.144 --> 19:48.305
Can some...

19:56.362 --> 19:58.069
Hmm-mm-mm.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.943
Yeah, I think we need to stop
feeding him Valiums, man.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.026
I know, look at him, man.
He looks like a disaster.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.885
Can you imagine him at our Hollywood parties?
He's got no tolerance.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.909
How can I help
you gentlemen today?

20:09.125 --> 20:11.663
The three of us adults would
like three tickets to Colombia,

20:11.877 --> 20:14.039
and you can put it
on that man's card.

20:14.255 --> 20:18.465
South Carolina, that's what I'm talkin'
about, man. I got cousins down there.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.876
That's good, man, but we're not
going to South Carolina.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.295
Sir, I think he means
the country of Colombia.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.848
Colombia!
Vincent, are you crazy, man?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.766
That is the drug capital
of the world.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.766
I'm black, they're gonna think
I'm trafficking... click-click.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.064
Chill, dude,
you'll be fine, man.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.063
Everybody knows the Valley's
the drug capital of the world.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.860
Can I carry this on?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.278
Yes.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.991
Betcha they ain't even got
black people in Colombia.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.366
I'm pretty sure the entire country
was founded by black people.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.039
Right, you geniuses
are all set.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.708
Have a wonderful time in the
African nation of Colombia!

21:10.394 --> 21:11.805
How is he?

21:12.021 --> 21:13.603
Passed out.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.023
They found an empty row,
just laid him on down there.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.476
Where did you get
them clothes, man?

21:19.653 --> 21:22.396
Don't be laughing at my clothes, man.
Stewardess gave me this.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.777
That boy slobbered
all over my new shirt.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.745
Kurt can never catch
a break, man. Ever.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.948
What?

21:33.167 --> 21:35.750
Do you want to look
in the motherfucking mirror?

21:35.961 --> 21:38.624
All right, I admit I'm going
through a transition right now.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.925
- Oh, that's funny, isn't it?
- You goin' through a tran...

21:44.136 --> 21:49.097
Vincent, we on a plane.
Where we goin', and why?

21:49.308 --> 21:52.392
Man... you need to learn
to relax.

21:52.603 --> 21:56.688
We are in first class, man.
This is first class. Look at this!

21:59.568 --> 22:00.934
What the fuck up, Vincent?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.315
Promise you're not
gonna get mad.

22:03.531 --> 22:06.023
First class!
What the fuck's up?

22:06.242 --> 22:07.483
All right.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.944
You know, on the news,
every day, that guy,

22:11.163 --> 22:14.281
Juan Garcia, in Colombia.
You know who I'm talking about?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.618
The drug lord Garcia,
chop your head off, yeah, him.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.717
Well, he doesn't necessarily
chop your head off.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.123
I mean, we don't know that.
That's what the news is telling us.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.755
All right? Listen to what
I'm going to say.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.587
- I'm listening.
- There is a 20...

22:28.806 --> 22:33.096
There is a $25 million reward
for the capture of this dude.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.553
And what the fuck
does that have to do with us?

22:38.107 --> 22:40.349
$25 million.

22:40.568 --> 22:43.936
Are you out of your
motherfucking mind, Vincent?

22:44.154 --> 22:46.066
He kill people, man.
Your dog will be dead!

22:46.282 --> 22:47.818
The motherfucker
kidnap families,

22:48.033 --> 22:51.197
take 'em over to Colombia
and they never come back, man.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.932
I'm not talking about that.
I'm just saying, let's do recognizance.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.822
That ain't even a word,
"recognizance."

22:56.000 --> 22:58.492
We just go look and see what's
happening from a distance.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.247
- From a distance?
- From a distance.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.079
- Like a vacation.
- Yeah. It is a vac...

23:03.299 --> 23:05.211
- In first class!
- All right.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.821
I like living, know what I'm saying?
Ain't nothing like breathing.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.383
I never heard a dead
motherfucker come back...

23:10.598 --> 23:13.511
- Well, then breathe...
- and say how good it is to be dead.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.137
...some of this.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.895
Is that them shrooms,
motherfucker?

23:19.106 --> 23:20.893
- It is.
- Chocolate marsh.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.748
Yeah, you don't have to yell
to everybody.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.894
Yes, it is, my nigga, it is.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.196
This motherfuckin' trip just got a
whole lot better, know what I'm sayin'?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.740
- Have the pudding.
- Hmm?

23:30.951 --> 23:34.115
It tastes a little different.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.492
He didn't get much time
to put it together, he said.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.243
So...

23:38.459 --> 23:42.123
he had to substitute
a couple of the ingredients.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.876
What did he substitute?

23:45.090 --> 23:47.002
Small shit, like butter.

23:47.217 --> 23:50.301
Butter? What did he replace
the butter with?

23:50.512 --> 23:52.128
What did he say, hold on?

23:52.348 --> 23:54.715
Pee-otee? Pee-ot...
Pay-ot... Pee-ari.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.175
Peyote?!

23:58.020 --> 24:00.307
That motherfucker fucked
a fire hydrant

24:00.522 --> 24:02.184
butt asshole naked
on that shit.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.391
On a Sunday,
in front of the church.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.771
He said it was cool, man.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.602
If you can't trust
your drug dealer,

24:07.821 --> 24:10.689
who are you gonna trust, man?
He does this for a living.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.385
Did you hear what the fuck
you just said?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.828
Chemistry lesson 101.

24:21.043 --> 24:24.832
Taking a hodgepodge of drugs
at 35,000 feet

24:25.047 --> 24:28.131
may cause you
to simply feel faded.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.632

25:16.974 --> 25:20.809
You're white,

25:21.020 --> 25:24.058
Hi, Mr. Johnson. The pilots would
like a word with you in the cockpit.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.606

Well, hiya, Christopher.
Come on, son, sit down!

25:51.133 --> 25:52.965
How'd you like to fly the plane?

25:53.177 --> 25:55.464
Man, are you serious?
I don't know how to fly no plane.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.390
Oh, you old devil, you!
Come on, son!

26:01.560 --> 26:05.520
You're white, you can do

Yeah, I can get used
to this white shit.

26:41.225 --> 26:42.591
Hmm.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.972
Credit score done went up.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.895
Hah. Yeah.

26:55.364 --> 26:59.108
Nooooooo!

27:04.540 --> 27:06.247
After a long flight,

27:06.458 --> 27:10.418
our hapless heroes arrive
in Colombia, South America,

27:10.629 --> 27:12.416
which should be
very interesting,

27:12.631 --> 27:15.044
as Vincent and Chris
believe that Colombia

27:15.259 --> 27:17.592
is just another city
in Mexico.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.514
Whoa!

27:33.735 --> 27:35.476
You got him?

27:35.696 --> 27:36.857
Yep.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.734
Oh, man!

27:40.868 --> 27:42.530
Prop him up against here.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.336
Man, what is this?
Ain't no black people here, man.

27:54.548 --> 27:55.709
You lied.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.086
I don't know
about this shit, but...

27:59.845 --> 28:02.087
That is not what it looks like
in the picture, right?

28:02.306 --> 28:05.470
- It says five stars.
- Man, this ain't one star. This ain't a quarter moon.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.973
This place is nasty, man.
All right, let's go.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.181
- Uh, what about Kurt, man?
- What about him, man?

28:12.399 --> 28:14.641
We're in a foreign country,
they love Americans.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.226
Dude'll be fine.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.531
We're Americans!

28:36.632 --> 28:38.544
Three rooms, please.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.465
- Three rooms?
- ¿Qué necesitas?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.922
¿Qué necesitas?

28:46.141 --> 28:49.179
Something about a K and sisters.

28:49.394 --> 28:53.229
¿Ah necesitas una habitación,
para alquilar?

28:53.398 --> 28:55.435
Sólo tenemos una.

28:55.651 --> 28:58.359
- I don't know, bro.
- You better know, man.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.653
You've been reading that damn
Mexican travel guide

29:00.864 --> 29:02.480
ever since you was on
the damn plane.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.156
Now, figure this shit out, man.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.408
It doesn't say anything
about ordering a room, dude.

29:06.453 --> 29:11.414
It says, like, fuckin' plants
and soccer and shit, that's it.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.618
- Like Escobar, you'd give him a room, wouldn't you?
- Escobar?

29:14.836 --> 29:18.250
Yeah, Escobar.
Like the soccer player.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.664
Like goal!

29:24.096 --> 29:25.803
¡Dios mío!

29:26.014 --> 29:27.971
What the fuck did you
just do, Vincent?

29:28.183 --> 29:29.924
I don't know.
Andrés Escobar

29:30.102 --> 29:32.890
is Colombia's best soccer player,
says it right there.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.516
Man, let me see this.

29:36.566 --> 29:39.479
No damn wonder. This is 1992.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.857
This motherfucking magazine
is 20 years old.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.592
No wonder she didn't understand
what the fuck you talkin' about.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.119
- What is that?
- Get y'alls skins!

29:49.329 --> 29:52.163
- Hey, yo, man, look!
- It's a midget with a gat.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.740
You're Americans?

29:53.959 --> 29:56.747
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're cool, right? Americans.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.954
Why you singing praises
to Pablo Escobar?

29:59.172 --> 30:01.414
We ain't praisin' nobody
but the Lord.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.169
We're God's children.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.593
We were sent here
to build a small mission

30:05.804 --> 30:10.424
for the Lord... mission...
for Jesus's children.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.383
And we don't know
Pablo Escobar, bro.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.264
Put the gun down, please.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.477
Forgive her, she's getting
senile in her later years.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.149
All right.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.147
Three rooms.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.230
Twenty American dollars.
Only have one room and one bed.

30:25.449 --> 30:29.568
The hell with that.
Come on, $20?

30:29.786 --> 30:32.449
Just get the room, man.
Little dude's got a gat.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.246
We can get
another hotel tomorrow.

30:34.458 --> 30:35.539
We only accept cash.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.333
You got a spa?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.098
It's never easy informing
one of your friends

30:41.214 --> 30:43.547
that while he was in
a drug-induced coma,

30:43.759 --> 30:44.875
his marriage ended.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.756
But hey, what are friends for?

30:47.971 --> 30:50.338
Fuckin' hug him.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.971
- Fuck you, you hug him.
- I'm not... I had to tell him.

30:54.186 --> 30:57.099
I had to wipe the slobber off his
face the whole flight down here

30:57.314 --> 30:59.274
while you were jacking off
underneath the blanket.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.852
How did you know
I was jacking off?

31:01.068 --> 31:04.652
- Smooth ripples in the blanket.
- I should have used the jacket.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.775
Jackets are real smooth,
got the material.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.902
When it get crunchy
it don't wrinkle up.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.359
I ain't never done it myself
but it's what I heard.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.820
- Good lookin' out, next time.
- That's what's up.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.913
I think a drink
is in order for you.

31:20.128 --> 31:23.292
So you thought bringing us to a
Third World country was a good idea?

31:23.507 --> 31:26.875
To catch a fucking Colombian
cartel drug lord? Are you mental?

31:27.094 --> 31:29.006
Keep it down, man.
These people all look alike.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.382
They could be the cartel.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.384
He's trying
to get us killed.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.319
You're gonna get us
fucking killed, Vincent.

31:34.476 --> 31:38.516
Maybe it wasn't a well thought out plan,
right, but we're here.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.767
So let's just do this.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.769
How could you let this happen?

31:42.984 --> 31:45.977
I didn't do shit.
He told me we was coming on vacation.

31:46.196 --> 31:48.062
I didn't know we was gonna
be doin' Rambo shit.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.943
Have you lost your mind?

31:50.158 --> 31:53.026
No, Kurt, you lost your mind,
and your wife, your job

31:53.245 --> 31:55.237
and your dignity,
all in, what, three hours?

31:55.455 --> 31:57.975
- I can testify to that.
- I can't believe I'm getting a divorce.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.873
Just think about it.

32:00.085 --> 32:03.704
$25 million. $25 million.
Do you know how much that is?

32:03.922 --> 32:07.415
$8,333,333.33 apiece.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.591
Motherfuckin' Rain Man.

32:09.803 --> 32:11.169
We're still gonna get killed.

32:11.388 --> 32:13.596
None of us know anything
about capturing a drug lord.

32:13.807 --> 32:17.596
You can say that again. He know what he
talkin' about. I didn't think of it like that.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.894
Everybody's got their thing,
this is our thing.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.666
Kurt, wouldn't you like
to show your ex-wife

32:21.690 --> 32:22.690
that you're not a loser?

32:22.774 --> 32:25.482
- Who said I was a loser?
- She did.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.902
- What a bitch.
- And, Chris, wouldn't you like

32:28.113 --> 32:30.007
to throw a baseball with a kid
that's actually yours?

32:30.031 --> 32:31.772
Yeah, that's funny.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.816
I'd like to do that
one of these days.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.402
Come on, man, listen,
if we go back to L.A.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.328
like this, broke,
what do we got?

32:38.540 --> 32:39.997
We got shit.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.949
Listen, I'm goin',
I'm doin' this.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.702
Now, who's with me?

32:44.921 --> 32:46.287
- Fuck it, I'm in.
- Thank you.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.623
I'm still not sure
why I'm even here.

32:48.842 --> 32:53.633
Hey, man, grow some nuts so the squirrel
can climb up the tree and nibble on 'em.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.839
I'm not even sure
that made sense,

32:56.057 --> 32:57.719
but you should listen to him.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.018
All right, I'm in.
Let's do this, fuck it!

33:01.229 --> 33:02.765
And fuck that bitch!

33:14.743 --> 33:16.700
Got that shit, man,
raise the roof!

33:23.585 --> 33:25.952
There are my Americano brothers!

33:26.171 --> 33:28.254
Come on, I take you
to the other party

33:28.465 --> 33:31.003
with all the girls
and cocaine you want...

33:31.218 --> 33:32.880
I'm goin' with him.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.302
I'm goin' with him and him.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.222
He got pussy, man,
you trippin'.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.221
Pussy is not a bad thing.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.770
That's what I'm saying, 'cause
you guys are doing it all wrong.

33:44.981 --> 33:49.066
You need to package and combine these
drugs for more efficient distribution.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.484
Hmm.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.106
Man, snap out of
that grunting shit.

33:52.322 --> 33:55.440
Mmm... What?
Hmm, I'm not grunting.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.446
Could have swore we were drunk.

33:57.661 --> 34:01.280
I'm still drunk.
But I'm up, but I'm drunk.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.364
Yeah.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.202
This is Alaska right up here.
This is Alaska. See all the snow?

34:07.420 --> 34:10.458
That's Canada.

34:10.674 --> 34:14.588
So we're gonna come in here,
and come in here, and come over here.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.045
- Hmm.
- Man, I need a gun.

34:17.264 --> 34:18.800
We need guns.

34:19.014 --> 34:21.507
Think about it, a.357 Magnum,
if we're gonna do this.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.558
Man, fuck that baby shit.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.685
I need a AK-47.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.230
I could bust a cap
in the motherfucker's ass.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.524
Ack-ack-ack.
Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack!

34:30.735 --> 34:31.976
Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack!

34:33.655 --> 34:34.896
You forgot one.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.572
Ack!

34:38.702 --> 34:41.409
- Ahem, titties.
- Yes, they are.

34:46.668 --> 34:50.331
Uh, I'm gonna go say hello to
her two friends, tit and tat.

34:50.547 --> 34:55.212
No, no, no, no, we gonna say
hello to tit and tat...

34:55.427 --> 34:56.713
We ain't doin' the "we."

34:56.928 --> 34:59.762
Ain't no sword-fightin',
nuts ain't bouncin', no.

34:59.973 --> 35:01.760
No, no, no,
we'll Eiffel Tower her, man.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.578
I don't wanna touch
your balls either, man.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.888
We get on each end.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.596
I'm not making a porno.
I'm going in here and fuck.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.641
I think it's London Bridge, man.
We'll London Bridge her!

35:14.237 --> 35:15.444
Oh.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.574
Hello. ¿Cómo estás?

35:20.785 --> 35:23.528
- Mm.
- Vamos.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.238
OK.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.098
If you could smuggle
less by sea

35:45.310 --> 35:47.848
and more by air... here,

35:48.063 --> 35:50.771
in this, uh...
in this vicinity right here,

35:50.982 --> 35:54.271
you could attack the United States
where they least expect it.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.729
- Jesus!
- Enough.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.828
How do you know so much about...

36:06.039 --> 36:07.826
marketing cocaine?

36:08.041 --> 36:10.033
I...

36:10.251 --> 36:12.208
I don't know anything.

36:14.255 --> 36:17.419
Oh, you've been teaching
everybody like school children.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.593
No, I just know business.
I'm a...

36:21.805 --> 36:24.889
It's not like it's rocket science.
It's actually common sense.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.092
Oh, so you're calling me stupid!

36:27.310 --> 36:30.053
No, no, no, I don't...
I don't even know you.

36:30.271 --> 36:34.561
I don't know when I've
been so disrespected in my own homeland!

36:34.776 --> 36:36.142
But...

36:36.361 --> 36:39.229
Am I such a man that should be
treated like this?

36:39.447 --> 36:41.313
No.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.525
You know what?

36:43.743 --> 36:46.076
I don't think I should be
the one that should be...

36:48.456 --> 36:51.199
discussing your fate.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.536
I think maybe we should
take him to...

36:56.381 --> 36:58.247
Garcia.

36:58.466 --> 37:02.335
Juan Garcia, no, no. I haven't got... fate?
I don't need to see him.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.090
Get him.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.092
Can't we talk about this?

37:08.351 --> 37:11.435
I'm really sorry!
I didn't mean to!

37:13.732 --> 37:16.691
That's what I'm talkin' about.
You Mexican girls are hot!

37:16.901 --> 37:18.813
I'm not fucking Mexican.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.520
Oh, well, whatever.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.732
That's what I'm talking about.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.319
- Oh, shit! Fuck!
- Aaah!

37:27.620 --> 37:29.407
She's got a fuckin' dick!

37:29.622 --> 37:32.080
Damn, I was just about to bust!
You better be...

37:32.250 --> 37:36.369
Fuck! Aaah!

37:36.588 --> 37:37.999
Shit.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.206
Goddamn, man!

37:40.425 --> 37:42.417
I just passed a chick
with a dick.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.217
I know, man,
I touched her fucking ass!

37:44.429 --> 37:46.796
- You touched her ass?
- I did!

37:47.015 --> 37:49.507
Oh, goddamn, man, eh!

37:49.726 --> 37:52.013
It's gonna be all right.
Man, this is a freak scene.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.390
That shit make me gay?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.144
No, just... alternative.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.684
Man, I don't want any more
fucking cocaine!

37:59.903 --> 38:02.896
All right, man, don't do no more blow!
My friend ain't gay!

38:03.114 --> 38:05.982
So, she had a dick?
You didn't touch it, you didn't...

38:06.201 --> 38:07.988
- Did you suck it?
- No.

38:08.203 --> 38:11.446
All right, 'cause I was gonna...
Kurt! They got Kurt, man!

38:11.664 --> 38:13.451
They got a gun to his head!

38:13.666 --> 38:15.202
Come on, man.
Let that shit go!

38:17.253 --> 38:22.624
Would you like cream and sugar
with your coffee, Mister...?

38:22.842 --> 38:25.175
Oh, Mr. Pomeroy.
Kurt. Kurt Pomeroy.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.469
And I'll take Splenda,
if you have it.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.718
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Pomeroy?

38:30.934 --> 38:33.221
I've, um...

38:33.436 --> 38:36.645
I've seen news reports
about you in America.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.314
How do they portray me?

38:39.526 --> 38:43.611
They say that you're a...
Your business is

38:43.822 --> 38:46.405
the cause of a lot of violence,

38:46.616 --> 38:49.609
both here in South America
and in North America.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.820
So I've heard.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.155
Let me say this, Mr. Pomeroy.

38:54.374 --> 38:57.117
Long before our country
learned how to capitalize

38:57.335 --> 39:01.045
on our largest export,
we were a nation in despair.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.168
A very poor country

39:03.383 --> 39:04.999
where industry would have
never existed

39:05.218 --> 39:07.676
or jobs, or schools,
as we have today,

39:07.887 --> 39:09.879
without cocaine.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.431
The United States suffers
from a disease

39:12.642 --> 39:13.928
you Americans call

39:14.143 --> 39:18.183
multiple personality disorder.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.560
I'm not sure I follow you.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.144
I will explain.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.852
The State Department
in Washington

39:25.071 --> 39:27.654
sends down a representative
every few months.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.778
They work out
a special deal with us.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.825
They give us a free route,

39:32.036 --> 39:34.244
where we can bypass
the Mexican distribution

39:34.455 --> 39:37.448
and sell our products
straight to the streets.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.454
Now, not having to deal
with the Mexicans

39:39.669 --> 39:42.412
quadruples our earnings
and keeps me from having to deal

39:42.630 --> 39:45.088
with those dirty,
uneducated field mice,

39:45.300 --> 39:46.586
as I like to call them.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.009
Then...

39:49.220 --> 39:51.382
the United States'
other personality appears.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.055
And they send down
a representative

39:53.266 --> 39:56.225
calling off all deals
and demanding money from me.

39:56.436 --> 39:59.600
Now, I call that extortion,
Mr. Pomeroy.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.648
But there's nothing
I can do about that.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.441
Yet.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.269
Why exactly am I here?

40:07.447 --> 40:09.404
My associate here, Mr. Diego,

40:09.616 --> 40:13.030
he knows more about this business
than anyone that I know.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.156
He overheard you tonight,

40:15.371 --> 40:17.863
apparently sharing
a great wealth of information

40:18.082 --> 40:19.869
on how to improve our business.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.497
And I want to find out
what that is.

40:22.712 --> 40:26.205
No, I really, I don't know.
I don't know anything.

40:26.424 --> 40:31.419
One more time... and I'm going
to sew your lips shut

40:31.638 --> 40:33.550
with your hair.

40:33.765 --> 40:37.600
Mr. Pomeroy,
let us take a walk outside.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.565
As you know from doing
business in America,

40:45.777 --> 40:48.736
loss is something
you cannot tolerate.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.360
Oh, my God, no. No.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.782
Now Mr. Diego will take you
into the study.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.985
There you will find
a stack of files

40:56.204 --> 40:59.197
that he will explain just enough
to get you started.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.078
W-what if I said no?

41:02.293 --> 41:04.455
Well, I will show you.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.829
Mátalo.

41:09.425 --> 41:14.136
God, no! No! No! No!

41:14.347 --> 41:16.179
Good night, Mr. Pomeroy.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.145
She had a dick!

41:36.494 --> 41:38.861
Well, what the hell
is you sayin', pig?

41:39.080 --> 41:42.244
Get up! Colonel Andreas
will see you now.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.451
Brilliant.

41:45.670 --> 41:48.128
What do I owe the honor
of being woken up

41:48.339 --> 41:52.333
in the middle of the night by one of my
soldados speaking about a kidnapping?

41:52.510 --> 41:57.005
Our friend got kidnapped. He got taken
away in a Jeep. That's why we came here.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.385
Hombres...

41:59.600 --> 42:02.593
you're not answering
my question.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.395
Why did you two
come into my station

42:05.606 --> 42:10.476
at 4 a.m., yelling, screaming,
demanding that I be woken up?!

42:12.363 --> 42:13.729
I...

42:13.948 --> 42:17.612
El kidnappo, kidnappay.
Like we just told you.

42:17.827 --> 42:20.410
Our friend got taken and we're
trying to get him back.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.409
Hey, hey, look, man.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.832
Our friend was taken in a Jeep.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.457
I know damn well he ain't
outside that window, man.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.628
Why are you wasting our time?
We've been here...

42:32.425 --> 42:34.883
Chris, fucking chill.
Third World country.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.757
You should listen to
your friend, Mr. Christopher.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.635
That way you might make it
out of this country

42:40.850 --> 42:44.059
sitting in the seat of a plane
and not a wooden box.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.345
Look, you took me
out of context, man.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.556
You know, I have a problem
when I get hot.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.732
You know, I have a mental thing
that happens,

42:50.902 --> 42:53.064
and it's kind of like
Tourette's... motherfucker!

42:53.279 --> 42:57.193
You know, so, uh... shit!

42:57.408 --> 42:59.741
Sorry. Sir.

42:59.952 --> 43:03.741
I cannot help you.
You need to head to Bogotá

43:03.956 --> 43:05.822
and see someone
in the US embassy.

43:06.042 --> 43:09.376
- They will be able to help you.
- Carlos.

43:09.587 --> 43:13.422
- This way, let's go.
- No, we're not done here.

43:13.633 --> 43:16.751
Yes, I've got a gun!

43:16.969 --> 43:20.553
- You can put that down.
- Go, go!

43:20.765 --> 43:22.472
iRápido, vamos!

43:22.642 --> 43:25.385
- Is this some Mexican boardroom?
- Hey, what are we doing here?

43:25.603 --> 43:28.283
You're in some shit already just by
coming to the station last night.

43:28.481 --> 43:29.722
They know!

43:29.941 --> 43:31.603
Who knows?

43:31.818 --> 43:33.810
- Garcia cartel.
- The cartel!

43:34.028 --> 43:37.988
Keep your voices down! They're everywhere,
even in this policía station!

43:38.199 --> 43:40.441
How do they know who we are?

43:40.660 --> 43:44.324
You two idiots came in here yelling at the
top of your lungs about some kidnapping.

43:44.539 --> 43:48.374
They would kill me if anyone found out I
was telling you this, so listen carefully.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.668
You're going to go to the embassy and
tell them about your American friend.

43:51.879 --> 43:57.125
Tell them he's being held by...
one Armando Garcia of the Garcia cartel.

43:57.343 --> 44:01.508
They will start a negotiation for
his release in two or three months.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.760
Two or three months?
Are you crazy? They got him now!

44:04.976 --> 44:08.970
You have no other choice. Now that they know
you're here, they will kill you, sure enough.

44:09.188 --> 44:14.684
Why you want to help us?
- My people have lived in fear of cartel regimes over 30 years.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.902
The United States is our only hope on
stopping them and their murderous ways.

44:17.947 --> 44:23.067
Having an American kidnapped will bring
exposure to this and help with our efforts.

44:23.286 --> 44:25.323
There's gotta be another way.

44:25.538 --> 44:28.201
- I may know someone.
- Who?

44:28.416 --> 44:29.657
There's this guy.

44:29.876 --> 44:32.994
He's a former American
Special Forces unit guy.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.579
He's very local.
Name is Jon Waters.

44:35.798 --> 44:39.257
He lives in the old church
in the middle of the village.

44:39.468 --> 44:42.506
Oh, and another thing.
This is Colombia, not Mexico.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.467
We're not Mexican,
you imbeciles!

44:44.682 --> 44:46.548
Wait a minute.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.599
How do we get in touch with you?

44:48.811 --> 44:49.972
You don't.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.478
What did he just say?

44:55.693 --> 44:58.310
I think he said we're fucked.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.645
What the fuck.

44:59.864 --> 45:02.322
Man, you always
getting me in some shit!

45:05.369 --> 45:07.031
Very, very, very, very...

45:07.246 --> 45:10.865
Oh, very good!

45:11.042 --> 45:12.999
Yes, oh!
The US involvement.

45:15.046 --> 45:17.083
Very good, Mr. Pomeroy.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.039
I see you and I
are going to have

45:19.258 --> 45:21.215
a very fruitful
business relationship.

45:21.427 --> 45:25.421
You, my friend,
are going to be very rich.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.972
Uh...

45:27.183 --> 45:30.221
with all due respect,
Mr. Garcia, I, uh...

45:30.436 --> 45:32.894
I have a wife and a job
back in L.A.

45:33.105 --> 45:36.098
I, uh...
I can't stay here.

45:38.694 --> 45:41.437
Mr. Pomeroy.

45:41.656 --> 45:45.149
Your wife filed for divorce
in a Los Angeles courtroom

45:45.368 --> 45:48.736
yesterday afternoon.

45:48.955 --> 45:50.571
And as for your job...

45:50.790 --> 45:54.204
my associate informed me
that you no longer have one.

45:54.418 --> 45:56.751
You see, Mr. Pomeroy,

45:56.963 --> 46:00.127
information is extremely
valuable in our business.

46:00.341 --> 46:01.582
You have spies?

46:01.801 --> 46:04.168
No. We have Google.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.509
Now, why don't you just
make yourself comfortable?

46:08.724 --> 46:11.057
Make yourself at home,
Mr. Pomeroy.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.386
The choice to stay
is not yours.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.347
But your choice to live. Yes.

46:19.151 --> 46:20.562
Come.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.895
Come. Come!

46:25.616 --> 46:28.905
Please. I want you
to check out the view.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.830
You may find it somewhat...
meaningful.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.590
Oh, God!

46:56.314 --> 46:57.930
My God!

47:21.964 --> 47:26.174
Even in a moment of sheer terror
at what he had just witnessed,

47:26.385 --> 47:29.969
no man can resist the
mysterious and majestic beauty

47:30.181 --> 47:31.717
of the punani.

47:37.480 --> 47:40.223
- This has gotta be it.
- Looks like the place to me.

47:40.441 --> 47:42.182
What do you think
"fuck off" means?

47:42.401 --> 47:44.939
It means don't come in the
motherfucker but knock anyway.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.945
Go away!

47:48.157 --> 47:51.150
My name's Vince, this is Chris.
We're looking for Jon Waters!

47:51.369 --> 47:54.282
How do you know my name?
What do you want?

47:54.497 --> 47:57.786
Look, Policía Carlos sent us over here, man.
We're just looking for help!

47:58.000 --> 48:00.492
I don't know no Carlos.
Fuck off!

48:00.711 --> 48:03.374
Come on, man, our friend
got kidnapped by the cartel!

48:03.589 --> 48:05.421
Ohh!

48:05.633 --> 48:08.216
Hey, that's my manhood you got
that shit pointing at.

48:08.427 --> 48:11.465
Jon, put away the fucking guns,
man, we're cool!

48:13.641 --> 48:17.806
- What the fuck is going on?
- IDs now.

48:24.568 --> 48:26.685
Come on, Jon, we're cool.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.770
Hey, you're Americans.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.480
No shit, can we just come in?

48:33.577 --> 48:35.193
Boy's a genius.

48:37.540 --> 48:38.906
Come on, get in there!

48:40.292 --> 48:43.035
This motherfucker's
in his underwear.

48:43.254 --> 48:46.372
All right, take a seat,
tell me your story.

48:46.590 --> 48:48.902
Man, this makes South
Central look like Beverly Hills.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.637
Oh, well.

48:56.183 --> 48:57.970
Tell me your story.

48:58.185 --> 49:01.553
All right, we came out here
on vacation.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.434
We went to a party.

49:03.649 --> 49:05.732
Cartel members kidnapped
our friend.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.276
We were told
that you can help us.

49:11.615 --> 49:15.279
You want me to light
that dog dick you puffin' on?

49:15.494 --> 49:16.735
I don't smoke.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.820
How do you know it's the cartel?

49:18.998 --> 49:20.955
The guy at the police station
told us...

49:21.167 --> 49:23.159
Heh heh heh heh heh!

49:23.377 --> 49:25.915
- What are you doing?
- Ha.

49:26.130 --> 49:29.874
You can't go to the police.
Are you fucking crazy?

49:30.092 --> 49:31.583
They don't do anything.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.840
I tried to tell him, man.
I got warrants, I told you.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.701
The police stations are connected all
over the world. They got computers now.

49:37.725 --> 49:39.682
Thank you, my fellow negro.

49:39.894 --> 49:43.558
I came here in '89.

49:43.772 --> 49:45.809
With Special Ops Division.

49:46.025 --> 49:49.814
Dropped us in the jungle
30 clicks south of Medellin.

49:56.702 --> 50:00.412
Did you just eat that?
We've been out here for an hour.

50:00.623 --> 50:03.832
Special search and destroy
mission for Pablo Escobar.

50:04.043 --> 50:07.207
- The soccer player, thank you.
- Who?

50:07.421 --> 50:09.538
No, man, I'm talking
about Pablo Escobar,

50:09.715 --> 50:11.355
the most dangerous drug lord
in the world.

50:11.550 --> 50:13.382
You short bus recipient.

50:13.594 --> 50:16.382
That's why the lady
was crying at the hotel.

50:16.597 --> 50:19.618
How am I supposed to know there's more
than one person in Colombia named Escobar?

50:19.642 --> 50:21.508
Are you sure
he did not play soccer?

50:21.727 --> 50:23.969
Man, I don't know.

50:25.523 --> 50:27.185
So there we were,

50:27.399 --> 50:29.106
waiting for our orders.

50:29.318 --> 50:31.310
But they didn't come.

50:31.529 --> 50:34.647
Some asshole in Washington
decided to push it back,

50:34.865 --> 50:36.985
so weeks turned into months,
months turned into years,

50:37.034 --> 50:40.994
and next thing you know,
finally the order comes through.

50:41.205 --> 50:43.663
And, man, we were ready.

50:43.874 --> 50:47.584
And we went in there,
quieter than a virgin's queef.

50:47.795 --> 50:51.459
And we took him out
on the roof of his own home.

50:54.260 --> 50:57.719
Yeah, but then again,
some yahoos in Washington

50:57.930 --> 50:59.216
decided...

50:59.431 --> 51:03.846
to give credit
for a job well done

51:04.061 --> 51:05.268
to the Colombian army.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.812
Now, those monkeys...
excuse the expression...

51:08.023 --> 51:10.561
wouldn't have been able
to find Pablo Escobar

51:10.776 --> 51:12.392
if he was hiding
in their own jock strap.

51:16.156 --> 51:17.738
Yeah, well...

51:17.950 --> 51:19.566
So I've been waiting here
ever since

51:19.743 --> 51:22.486
to take down the cocaine cartel.

51:22.705 --> 51:26.119
- You want some?
- Yes, I do. What is it?

51:26.333 --> 51:28.666
- Urine.
- It's what?

51:28.877 --> 51:31.790
- You drinking your own piss?
- Oh, hell no!

51:33.424 --> 51:35.632
I couldn't fill this up
by myself.

51:35.843 --> 51:40.053
No, I got a couple of guys who go to
the bars downtown and fill it up fresh.

51:40.264 --> 51:42.802
Gives your skin a really nice glow.
You'd understand that.

51:43.017 --> 51:45.634
Can you help us or what, bro?

51:45.853 --> 51:47.515
Let me ask you a question.

51:47.730 --> 51:50.268
Do you want help
getting your friend back

51:50.482 --> 51:52.439
or do you wanna take down
the cartel?

51:52.651 --> 51:55.018
Look, man, we're willing to do
whatever it takes.

51:55.237 --> 51:58.230
We just don't wanna die,
if you know what I'm saying.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.735
We like being alive.

51:59.950 --> 52:03.864
OK. I will train you.

52:05.539 --> 52:08.532
But, boys, now is the time

52:08.751 --> 52:10.993
where you make the decision

52:11.211 --> 52:14.295
to be man enough
to call yourself soldiers.

52:14.506 --> 52:17.840
Because once you go into this thing,
there is no turning back.

52:18.052 --> 52:21.716
Once you awaken the beast,
you better have the balls to slay him.

52:24.099 --> 52:25.806
"Dinner at the Garden.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.723
I will send for you.
Maria."

52:30.898 --> 52:32.389
Hmm, what's that?

52:32.608 --> 52:36.227
"Don't even think
about cancelling."

52:46.413 --> 52:50.828
I cannot believe that you
did that to your best friend.

52:51.043 --> 52:52.409
He probably wanted to kill you.

52:52.628 --> 52:54.540
Oh, he did.

52:54.755 --> 52:57.418
Vincent hates it when you mess with his hair,
let alone shave it.

52:57.633 --> 53:01.126
But enough about him.
What do you call this again?

53:01.345 --> 53:03.745
- Carne con salsa de tamarindo.
- It's the best one I've had.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.797
- What did I tell you? Right?
- Oh, my God.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.474
Why do you speak
such good English?

53:08.686 --> 53:10.598
Well, I was born here
in Colombia,

53:10.813 --> 53:13.305
but I was educated
in the States.

53:13.524 --> 53:16.312
Actually, spent most
of my life in New York City.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.268
But I got pretty homesick

53:18.487 --> 53:20.479
so I decided to come back
to be with my father.

53:20.698 --> 53:23.190
That's... that's really sweet.

53:23.409 --> 53:25.116
I like you, Kurt.

53:25.327 --> 53:27.819
I really like you, too, Maria.

53:28.038 --> 53:31.247
And I'm honored that a woman
as beautiful as you

53:31.458 --> 53:34.792
would want to have
a dinner like this with me.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.995
But I'm a little concerned
about your father

53:37.214 --> 53:39.126
and some of his men.

53:40.801 --> 53:43.134
Have you seen what goes on here?

53:43.345 --> 53:45.337
It's not always that pretty.

53:45.556 --> 53:48.549
Listen, my father gives
these men opportunities

53:48.767 --> 53:52.477
that they would have never received
anywhere else in this country.

53:52.688 --> 53:55.431
He gives them a chance
at a good life, you know?

53:55.649 --> 53:58.232
I'm pretty sure I saw a man
ripped in half today.

53:58.444 --> 54:00.296
They're not always appreciative
as they should be.

54:00.320 --> 54:04.439
It's sad.
I weep for them.

54:04.658 --> 54:08.197
I just want you to know
that I respect your father.

54:08.412 --> 54:12.122
I mean, I...
I respect him.

54:12.332 --> 54:13.698
A lot.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.792
Gracias.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.718
It doesn't sounds as nice
when he says it.

54:32.060 --> 54:35.053
Goddamn, man, my head
fucking is killing me.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.185
Hey, mornin'.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.517
Whose idea was it
to drink moonshine?

54:40.736 --> 54:42.853
I didn't drink it, man.

54:43.071 --> 54:44.778
You and old boy was up
singing and dancing

54:44.948 --> 54:46.484
like y'all
was best friends forever.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.776
You do realize this dude's
bat-shit crazy, right?

54:49.953 --> 54:51.660
Pretty much.

54:51.872 --> 54:54.580
I'm telling you, Vince,
this is like some movie shit.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.704
And I know how this story goes.

54:56.919 --> 54:59.332
How does the story go?

54:59.546 --> 55:02.414
Man, you ain't never seen
them Harrison Ford movies?

55:02.633 --> 55:04.374
You know, he starts out
in Washington.

55:04.593 --> 55:06.425
Then he comes down
to South America.

55:06.637 --> 55:08.094
Next thing you know,
all his friends

55:08.305 --> 55:10.171
get blown up
by rockets and shit.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.177
Keep going.

55:12.392 --> 55:14.805
They probably already took
his ID out his wallet, right?

55:14.978 --> 55:16.389
Found out his address.

55:16.605 --> 55:18.847
They probably sent a hit man
to his crib in L.A.

55:19.066 --> 55:21.103
and killed his wife Brenda.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.025
Let's just go
to the embassy, all right?

55:23.237 --> 55:26.480
It's not like this GI Joe
motherfucker gonna be able...

55:26.657 --> 55:27.898
What the fuck?!

55:28.116 --> 55:32.235
Never underestimate
the element of surprise.

55:32.454 --> 55:36.243
First lesson: always be
aware of your surroundings.

55:36.458 --> 55:39.121
That was a lesson?

55:39.336 --> 55:40.998
Yes, it was.

55:41.213 --> 55:44.752
And training day
is just about to begin.

55:46.885 --> 55:51.220
So you stayed up all night
painting yourself like your wall?

55:52.850 --> 55:54.216
Affirmative.

55:56.979 --> 56:00.017
Maria and Kurt had grown
quite fond of one another,

56:00.232 --> 56:02.019
but when you're the daughter
of the world's

56:02.234 --> 56:04.100
most notorious drug lord,

56:04.319 --> 56:06.402
nothing remains a secret
for long.

56:15.706 --> 56:18.574
- Maria!
- Luis.

56:18.792 --> 56:20.937
You should have told me you were
going to leave the grounds,

56:20.961 --> 56:22.623
especially in front
of our new employee.

56:22.838 --> 56:25.626
Luis, always a comandante.

56:28.677 --> 56:31.260
Kurt, this is one of
my father's men, Luis Diego.

56:31.471 --> 56:33.258
Yep, we've had the pleasure
of meeting.

56:33.432 --> 56:35.139
He showed me
his knife collection.

56:35.350 --> 56:37.967
We need to talk to Señor Kurt.

56:38.186 --> 56:40.269
Talk to him.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.472
Not here, in private.

56:42.691 --> 56:43.852
You can talk to him here

56:44.067 --> 56:45.524
in front of me
and everybody else.

56:47.696 --> 56:49.107
No, it's OK.

56:49.323 --> 56:50.689
Are you sure?

56:50.908 --> 56:53.366
Yeah. I'll be fine.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.159
Carlo.

56:55.370 --> 56:56.906
Hey!

56:58.415 --> 57:01.829
Uhh! Stay! I got this!

57:02.044 --> 57:05.333
Ow!

57:09.927 --> 57:12.795
Now, Mr. Pomeroy,

57:13.013 --> 57:15.881
are you enjoying
Garcia's daughter?

57:16.099 --> 57:19.843
Whoa. That sounds like
a loaded question there, buddy.

57:29.029 --> 57:31.396
I believe that in America...

57:31.615 --> 57:36.201
the word "buddy" means
we're amigos.

57:38.413 --> 57:41.656
We are no way amigos,
you gringo bastard.

57:41.875 --> 57:42.911
¿Me entiendes?

57:45.003 --> 57:48.212
Yeah... I get it.

57:48.423 --> 57:50.836
Not... not buddies.

57:51.051 --> 57:53.088
Who are your friends...

57:53.303 --> 57:56.717
at the policía station
asking all the questions?

57:56.932 --> 57:58.844
I don't know anyone else here.

57:59.059 --> 58:02.348
Ohhh!

58:02.562 --> 58:05.430
OK... OK. They're harmless.

58:05.649 --> 58:08.016
All right? I can talk to them.

58:08.235 --> 58:10.978
Just let me talk to them,
and I'll keep them quiet.

58:11.196 --> 58:13.404
I'll get them to stop
talking to the police.

58:13.615 --> 58:14.947
Policía is no longer
the problem.

58:17.661 --> 58:22.122
Oh, my God! What the hell
is wrong with you people?

58:22.332 --> 58:23.539
Is killing all you know?

58:23.750 --> 58:26.584
- What? OK.
- Let me tell you this.

58:26.795 --> 58:29.003
When I find your two amigos,

58:29.214 --> 58:31.126
I am going to cut
their tongues out

58:31.341 --> 58:32.752
if they are lucky.

58:32.968 --> 58:34.550
If you touch them,
I'll kill you!

58:44.604 --> 58:45.890
OK!

58:46.106 --> 58:47.893
Gentlemen, welcome
to my training ground.

58:48.108 --> 58:51.192
You know what we're gonna do here,
a little agility training,

58:51.403 --> 58:53.895
a little bit of speed,
and maybe some weapons capability,

58:54.114 --> 58:56.071
see if we can turn you
into some soldiers.

58:56.283 --> 58:57.615
How's that sound?

58:57.826 --> 58:59.863
- It's cool.
- It's cool, man, let's do it.

59:00.078 --> 59:03.367
That's cool, man,
let's do it... Sir!

59:03.582 --> 59:05.462
All right, let's go over here.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.784
Yes, sir.

59:08.003 --> 59:10.290
Come on, come on!

59:10.505 --> 59:12.212
Swing it!

59:12.424 --> 59:16.794
Aaaaah!

59:17.012 --> 59:19.379
Why would you own
such a device?!

59:19.598 --> 59:21.464
Be a man about it!

59:23.268 --> 59:24.975
Climb over a wall.

59:25.187 --> 59:26.928
Aaaah!

59:29.649 --> 59:31.436
Ugggh!

59:31.651 --> 59:33.438
Climbin'!

59:33.612 --> 59:36.355
There's the enemy, Vincent.
That's the bomber, get it!

59:39.576 --> 59:40.692
What?

59:40.911 --> 59:43.494
Right here we got Niger.

59:43.705 --> 59:44.912
Niger runs right across

59:45.123 --> 59:47.831
the same latitude as Colombia,
right there.

59:48.043 --> 59:50.035
What you gonna do
when they come after you?

59:52.130 --> 59:55.623
That isn't how to kill a bird.
What are you doin', man?!

59:55.842 --> 59:57.959
The line goes down here
like that.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:01.637
Hey!
That's where you're comin' in.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.840
Right, and then
if he's coming in here,

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:05.675
then he's gotta go in there.

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:08.227
- Right, right here.
- He's right in there.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.238
- Right.
- You search for him.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.953
But if he's
gonna be over here...

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.571
Go!

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:21.274
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:22.779
Yeah!

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:28.448
You bitches!

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:34.545
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:57.690
It is my honor
to go into battle with you.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.566
You are my brethren.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:04.901
And one of our own is captive
by the poison

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.782
that is the cartel.

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.493
We need to rescue our friend.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.997
We need to bring him back
to the nest.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:16.749
Let's do it.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:18.126
Hoo-yah!

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.673
Haaaa!

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:26.843
All right, gentlemen, let me get
a picture for posterity.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.344
I just have to say one thing.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.080
There's only one thing
you need to know

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:33.855
to keep from getting killed
in battle, OK?

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:38.935
And that rule is, you must
never, and I mean never...

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:41.487
Oh, my God!

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.779
God damn!

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.233
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna throw up!

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.245
Man, this shit is fucked up.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.493
We ain't cut out
for this shit, Vincent.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.621
Don't even go there, man.
This is what Jon trained us for.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:57.328
It's not like the movies like
you're always talking about.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.459
It's not like we're gonna
show up, man,

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:02.963
and there's gonna be a mansion with
guys in suits and Uzis and shit.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:06.046
We'll go in there and kick
the door down L.A. style.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:08.802
Man, why you bullshittin'
yourself and me?

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:12.636
That motherfucker was
Special Forces, Marine Corps,

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:15.813
crazy son of a bitch,
and he got killed by a Mexican bitch

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.304
in a motherfucking
chicken truck.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:20.147
Man, have you ever seen
Breaking Bad?

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:22.524
Two regular dudes, right?
Come on.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.573
Then they became bad asses
and started cappin' people.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.571
That's exactly what we could do.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:29.527
That was a TV show.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.830
And it took 'em four seasons
to become bad asses.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:36.079
I've been a screw-up, bro,
ever since we were kids, man.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:39.207
I've never achieved anything
I set out to do,

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.665
and I know that, man,
I just kept bullshittin' people.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.921
But right now,
if I don't go get Kurt back,

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:48.095
this is all my fault, man,
this is my chance.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:52.175
This is your chance, man.
What have you got to go back to?

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.431
Come on, man, you look good.
Look at you.

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:56.638
You're holding guns and shit.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:01.976
All right, I hear you,
motherfucker, you know.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:05.438
We do got guns and shit.
Shit, I got a couple of grenades right here.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:08.017
That's what I'm... Do you even
know how to use those things?

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.698
No, but I can hit a motherfucker
in the head long-distance.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.832
What's he saying?

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:19.706
I think he's saying we can
pick up the dead body now.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.380
What do you mean, man? He's not going
anywhere. We'll get him when we come back.

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.236
Think about it.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.546
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.513
With their fearless leader
now roadkill,

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:35.765
Vincent and Chris continue
on their quest to rescue Kurt.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:43.435
I'm tired, man.
This must be it.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.111
Why don't you make a fire, man,
and I'll shoot some food.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.406
Man, you truly are
an ignorant motherfucker.

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:51.984
Why don't you just shoot a flare in the air
so they can come over here and kill us?

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:55.655
- I don't understand.
- Garcia's house is up the hill, fool.

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:57.957
I don't know anything
about this woods shit, man.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.205
I refused to be
in the Boy Scouts growing up.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.377
- Fuck that.
- Refused?

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.125
Yeah.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.084
What you got against
the Boy Scouts of America?

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.838
You better think about it.

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:11.842
All those old men taking
them young boys to the woods,

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:13.798
not allowing
any little girls to go...

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:20.517
Teaching them to "tie knots"
and be "Webelos."

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:24.191
Hmm-mm. Whole thing sounds like an
underground gay farm to me, I'm out.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.019
That's the smartest shit
you said all week.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:33.568
- We've got a special sauce.
- Piss-off.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.745
Look at this, man.

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:38.788
Shed some light on the subject.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.871
- That'll work, that'll work.
- Jackpot. Food.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:48.208
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:51.169
You know what?
This dude's got forks.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.115
- Thank you.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.472
He might be dead,
but he was a, uh...

01:04:55.683 --> 01:05:00.018
he was a proper dead man,
leaving his friends some stuff.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.644
- Look, man, don't play hard-ass.
- What you talkin' about, man?

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:06.896
You have not talked
about your wife leaving you

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.728
one time this entire trip.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:12.694
Come on, now. You need...
You need me to hug you?

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.071
Do you want me to... I will...

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.697
You see that?

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.575
You can put your head
right there.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.909
Love is a four-letter word,
like fuck and shit.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.539
Just something you gotta do.

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.760
I was in love once.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:35.964
Shoot him, man, shoot him!
He's a fuckin' zombie!

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:39.846
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:43.145
She was the most beautiful girl
in the world.

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:46.349
It was in Vietnam.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:49.026
And the minute we looked
into each other's eyes...

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:52.814
it was love.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:58.073
We were going
to love each other forever.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.793
Yeah, of course, I only
knew her for 15 seconds.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.005
She was my opponent
in a Russian roulette game.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:14.380
She lost.

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.508
Aaaaah!

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.090
What was her name?

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:25.263
I'm gonna call her Biglet.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.476
Biglet!

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:38.576
I tried to put her brains
back in her head, but...

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.196
that doesn't always work.

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:43.698
Hardly ever.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:46.500
Man, your motherfucking ass
was dead.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.661
He's right, man, you were dead.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.547
I can't die.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:56.093
You was dead, motherfucker.
You got hit by a chicken truck.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:58.421
You guys want
to get to business now?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.884
OK, first I gotta pee.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.435
When we approach the mansion,

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.390
we got to approach
from the east side.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:12.852
There's an outcropping of rocks.
It's great cover.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:18.112
And, as I was trying to tell you before
I got run over by a chicken truck...

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:03.277
Señor Garcia,
we all want the same things.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:06.614
But your new associate here
is asking for things

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.870
that are not reasonable.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.496
Not reasonable?

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:14.876
Mr. Pomeroy just spent
the last hour

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.424
explaining the newest
and the best option

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:22.005
to cut our distribution
losses by 75%.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.636
And you say it's not reasonable.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:37.111
Felix, your men are imbeciles.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:42.033
Yes, they our cowboys
with no class.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:44.359
And your country
is killing our distribution

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.787
because you idiots
are killing each other

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:50.332
like a bunch of uneducated
Compton gang members.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.283
No...

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:55.455
No, you have no control
over your men.

01:08:55.673 --> 01:09:01.294
Your ignorance is putting all
of us and our money at risk.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:07.008
Señor Garcia, you do not know
how difficult it is

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.764
to move product in Mexico now.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.893
We have to open up the lines
of distribution by using force.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:18.068
You wanted a bigger cut so you
stopped selling us your cocaine

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:21.238
and started leasing us
to move it for you.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:23.782
If you don't like the way
we do business,

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:27.111
we could go back to buying
your product wholesale.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:30.288
That way you would not have
to worry about the distribution.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.335
Very, very interesting.

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:39.506
Felix Santos is telling me
how to run my business.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.215
You Mexicans.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.218
You're just a pawn
in this chess game.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.470
The problem is that you all
want to be kings.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:55.148
Right here is your king.
Don't forget who your king is.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:58.522
Juanito.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:03.276
You do not realize how important
we are to your... "kingdom."

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.035
Without us,
you will be struggling

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:11.990
to even get your product
into the United States.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.416
And you, Mr. Pomeroy...

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:20.797
your idea of 25 747s
into Canada

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:23.170
and then rerouting them
into the southern states,

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:26.003
it's... it's too costly.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.430
Maybe you're right.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.133
Maybe we will lose
less product overall,

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:34.595
but we need more manpower
as it is.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:40.184
But, Juan, must you not forget

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.756
that battling the three-headed
monster that is the United States

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.692
is hard enough.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.274
If you choose to disrespect me,

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.610
and our efforts,

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.162
you will be adding
one more head to that monster.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:05.550
King, learn to respect
your pawns,

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.550
for they are the largest army
on the chess board.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:18.230
Luis, I think Mr. Santos
and his body guards

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.854
have overstayed their welcome.

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.230
Consider it done.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.778
Gracias.

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:34.079
Mr. Pomeroy, tomorrow morning
we are going to Mexico City

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:37.291
to meet our new distribution.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:53.094
Maria!

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:00.018
- Maria!
- Kurt.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.646
Look, uh...

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.024
- We're going horseback riding, want to join us?
- Horses? No, no.

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.571
Absolutely not.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:10.946
Look, there's been a problem.
I, uh...

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.198
I just saw your father and Felix Santos,
they got into an argument,

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:17.326
and I'm pretty sure Diego is on his
way to kill Santos and his men.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.956
Did you not just hear
what I said?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:25.084
Yeah, you were rambling on
about Santos or something.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:28.542
- Do you not like me anymore?
- I like you so much.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.921
I mean, you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:34.097
It's just that... these people,
they're killing each other

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:37.472
on a daily basis and...
it's insane.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:40.646
You are so cute
when you're nervous.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.689
Well, you...

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.017
you remember my two friends
I told you about?

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:48.445
- Uh, Vincent and Christopher?
- Your gringos?

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.069
Those gringos, the ones that
have been going to the police

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.492
and telling them about me
being missing 'cause I'm here.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:57.743
Uh, and I'm pretty sure that
Diego is gonna either kill them

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:00.950
or the United States is gonna
send someone here to find me.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.251
Either way, it's gonna end
bad for us.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:05.624
My father will handle them all.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.877
You are safe here.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:11.506
I don't want them handled,
I want them alive, they're my friends!

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.963
You don't need them anymore.

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:17.299
You have a new family here.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:19.851
Now, let's go horseback riding.

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:23.430
Uh... I gotta go change.
I'll be right back.

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:31.731
I'm gonna
have to kill him.

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.315
Aren't I?

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.947
Oh, Blanca...

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.577
probably.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.892
Which way we headed?

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.890
This things says north.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:06.519
So like northwest right there.
That should be it.

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:08.100
Hey, man, look.

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:10.606
Moss grows on the north side
of the trees.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:12.232
Learned that in Boy Scouts.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.940
Well, why don't you go look
for some fuckin' moss

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.651
on the north side of the trees
and I'm gonna use technology,

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:18.944
and we'll meet there?

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.620
I'll never find your ass.

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.413
Look, man,
I somehow got service.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.332
I can't get it
in the middle of L.A.,

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:27.040
but I damn sure get it out here,
I'm using this.

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:31.881
Unbeknownst to our heroes,

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:36.053
the Colombian army was already
mobilizing against the cartel.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.926
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:23.885
What, you mental midget
motherfucker?

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:27.062
Thought there weren't gonna be
nobody in suits and shit.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:30.186
Who fuckin' thought they'd be
walkin' around in suits, man?

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.939
You think a guy's job,
he goes home, changes clothes,

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:36.773
and goes, "Fuckin' relieve the next guy
who walks around in a suit with an Uzi"?

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:39.779
You got a problem, man.
You got a motherfucking problem.

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:42.532
This look like a Scarface reunion up in here,
man.

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.739
We ain't built for this shit,
I'm tellin' ya.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:48.621
- I'm bouncin', I'm gettin' the fuck up outta here.
- No, man.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:51.044
Shut up.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:56.876
It's a Mexican on a bicycle,
man, with a box.

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.210
Let me see that.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.011
Let me see
the motherfuckers, man.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.134
Here, hold this.
Stay on point, man.

01:16:02.349 --> 01:16:04.119
- I trained with this gun.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:05.743
Pull the trigger,
that's all, it's a gun.

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:07.097
Bang-bang, motherfucker.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.351
I'll be goddamn.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:14.230
Sellin' a box of oranges
at a motherfucking cartel crib.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:17.108
Gimme the gun.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.815
What the fuck is that?

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:22.242
- I don't know, man.
- Play dead, play dead!

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:26.037
Play dead?
This your motherfucking idea of "play dead"?

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.161
I didn't come here to do
a no motherfucking Machiavelli.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:31.288
- Shut the fuck up!
- You mensch.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:32.711
Mensch!

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:37.509
Just laying you down
into this motherfucking shit.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.334
- OK.
- Motherfucker.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:41.545
Like we been trained,
let's kill somebody.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.630
Somebody got to die
with this bitch.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.596
Where'd he go?

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:54.266
They pulled out a freakin' head.
They pulled a fuckin' head out.

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:56.101
Hold the gun, motherfucker.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.284
We need an extra brain,
motherfucker.

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:07.238
Let's go get the head.
Maybe he can think of some better shit.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:08.947
A dead man think
better planning.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.749
Just go, crawl, crawl!
Come on!

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.080
Diego.

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:19.253
What?

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:20.675
What the hell?

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:30.473
Vincent, Christopher!

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.355
You guys are gonna
get yourselves killed.

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:40.896
Hey! Maria!

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:45.280
Maria! Hi! I need to talk
to her, just for a second.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:48.658
Maria...
Holy shit, you look amazing.

01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:50.409
I love leather
and Japanese anime.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.622
That's, um...
That's a Mexican cartel.

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:56.606
They killed Diego.
We have to get out of here.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:59.338
I know, that's why I'm preparing
to kill Santos myself.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.214
Wait, sit down, sit down.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.718
My friends are here, all right?
You can come with us.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:10.141
You, too. Or not.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.844
- Your friends?
- Yeah, Vincent and Christopher?

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:16.060
They're alive, all right?
Come with us, I'll protect you.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:18.767
You dirty gringos.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:22.354
You think you can come here and
take our business and our home?

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.610
What? It's not
like that at all.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:56.763
Yaaaa!

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:11.494
Kurt, come on!

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.446
Come on so we can
get the hell outta here!

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:17.208
Come on!

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.456
- Oh, my God!
- Keep your head down.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:22.255
Vincent, this is the craziest
thing you've ever done to us!

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:25.670
Get me outta here!

01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:27.878
Who the fuck is the crazy bitch
shooting at us?

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:29.929
Oh, that's
Juan Garcia's daughter.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.842
We're in love; we had
the most amazing connection.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:36.053
You got a sick
motherfucking mind.

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:39.982
You fall in love with the biggest
bitch down here, just like back home.

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:43.811
I do not think this is the appropriate
place or time to be talking about this.

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.816
Shut the fuck up,
somebody's gotta shoot her!

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:49.274
- I love her.
- You do realize this bitch is trying to kill us?

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:51.860
- She's just a little confused.
- Well, then text the bitch

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:53.757
and tell her to quit
fucking shooting at us!

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.328
I don't even have her number.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:20:00.911
Chris, you said you could throw a
grenade like a baseball, right?

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.621
Motherfuckin' Satchel Paige.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.921
Throw it!

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:06.125
- A grenade?
- Here, hold this.

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:08.084
Shut up, man,
he won't pull the pin.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.421
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.175
You're not gonna
hurt her, right?

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:14.599
I'm gonna bean the bitch
and knock her the fuck out.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:18.224
Listen, I'm gonna create a diversion.
You know what a diversion is?

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:20.897
Yeah, that's when one
motherfucker do some crazy shit

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:23.100
so this motherfucker
can hit the bitch.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.319
Yeah.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:25.939
Aaaaaah!

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:30.190
Fuck you, bitch!

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.788
- Oh!
- Oh! Uh-huh!

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:40.083
- Oh, fuck!
- What was that?

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:43.583
- Aaaah!
- Get the fuck down!

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:46.005
You just fuckin'
blew that pussy up!

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:50.840
- That's Juan Garcia!
- That's him?

01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:52.967
- That's the man!
- The money! Go!

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.390
Move!

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.183
Wait for me!

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:36.051
Put the gun down!
Put the fucking gun down!

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:37.632
Put it down!

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:39.451
- Did you see that?
- We don't...

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:44.105
- Goddamn!
- You a killer now, motherfucker.

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.023
Come on, let's go, this way!

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:59.032
Goddamn, we're becoming bad asses.
This is fuckin' fun!

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.456
Hey, watch
your motherfucking gun!

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:02.786
Come on!

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.213
Where are you going,
motherfucker?

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.835
Maria!

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:17.013
- You all right, man?
- No, but throw the other grenade!

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.340
Get up!

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:25.021
Get it, Chris!

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:27.690
iBomba!

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:31.106
Stay here, on the ground!

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:34.689
iBomba, bomba!

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:37.821
Freeze, motherfucker, freeze!

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:41.871
Now, you can calm down, man.
Think we got him.

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:43.493
They did it.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.247
These three nitwits...
uh, I mean heroes...

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.500
actually captured the world's
most wanted criminal.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.297
I'm not even sure
there's anybody left.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:53.795
No, we killed
all these motherfuckers.

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:56.219
Maybe we should, uh,
call the embassy.

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.264
Yeah. Yeah, it's that time.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.138
I think you motherfuckers need
to call an ambulance, man.

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:04.184
Hey, man,
get in the back, man.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.934
Get up! Get up,
motherfucker, get up!

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.391
- All right.
- You heard the man.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.067
Where is Maria?

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:13.019
No! Get the fuck back!

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:15.730
- Where am I goin'?
- You're standing right here.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:18.066
- I got him. Get in.
- What are you doing?

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:20.197
Don't be shoving
that motherfucker on me!

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:21.948
- Go on, get in.
- Maria!

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:25.248
- What did you do to my Maria?
- Your Maria's dead!

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:28.543
I got that bitch's pussy in my pocket,
I'm gonna fuck it later.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.607
- Maria!
- Sit down!

01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:47.929
So that is when Mr. Pomeroy
decided to stay in Colombia

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:51.141
and now runs one of the most
controversial drug cartels in history.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.192
Yes, the Brighter Day cartel

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.228
still produces
and distributes cocaine

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.564
but they do it
in a very different way.

01:23:57.783 --> 01:24:01.026
Most of the money is used to
build better schools and housing

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:03.237
in the countries
of Mexico and Colombia.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.539
A logo for the cartel,
a new marketing department,

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:08.199
employee benefits...

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:10.744
makes this not
your everyday cartel.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:13.546
The Brighter Day cartel
is estimated to have surpassed

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:15.339
all other cartels
in total revenue,

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:19.090
although specific numbers will
never be released to the public.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.887
In parting,
we asked Kurt Pomeroy

01:24:22.099 --> 01:24:24.136
why he does what he does.

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:30.017
I would ultimately say
I get high helping others,

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.020
because others got high.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.955
So there you have it...

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.827
Looks good
with a mustache, don't he?

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:38.779
Yeah, he does, man.
I like that.

01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:40.732
So, there you have it.

01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:42.567
One of the greatest stories
ever told.

01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:44.277
Well, not really.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.864
But I'm sure you'll find
some moral to this story

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.621
that you can live your life by,
or some such nonsense.

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:54.375
And if not, honestly,
who really gives a shit?

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.270
Fazi is the newest leader

01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:58.549
of the Taliban in Afghanistan
and now number one

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.093
on the United States'
most-wanted list.

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:05.174
A reward for tens of millions of dollars
is being offered for his capture.

01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:09.011
US officials say Fazi should be
considered extremely dangerous.

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:11.596
- What's wrong?
- And now in other news...

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:14.390
Yo, you hear this?

01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:18.440
Yeah, I heard it.

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.317
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:23.775
I think you have lost your mind.
You got shot!

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.361
- Who cares? We're still here.
- Vincent!

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.196
It ain't happening, man.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.619
Why can't you just enjoy
the money?

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:33.668
Man, are you not surrounded by some
beautiful girls because of it?

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.836
That's exactly why
I don't want to do

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:38.210
what I think you're thinking
about us doing.

01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:40.963
I'm gonna stay right here
with the beautiful ladies.

01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:45.092
I need deep tissue before the retarded
child comes up with another idea

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:48.141
that I ain't down with,
by the way.

01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:51.470
I'm just asking you
to think about it.

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:55.932
