about her mysterious past.

Isn't there anything else
you can tell me?

14:01.707 --> 14:04.110
Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be
a waste of your time.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.613
That's impossible,
because my time
is worthless.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.381
Oh. Well,
then there is one thing.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.219
It's the note I found with Leela
the day she was abandoned.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.956
But it's written in Alienese,
so no one on Earth
can translate it.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.691
Not even Brainzilla.
Hand it over!

14:18.791 --> 14:21.727
Sure. I just wish
I could be more helpful.

Would you like some dirt
on any other orphans?

someone here. I'll have to
come back for those later.

Can you translate it?
Of course.

But only into

there's even less chance
of understanding it.

there's no way of knowing
how long it would take.

In my professional opinion
as an ear, ear, ear,
nose and throat doctor,

16:43.970 --> 16:47.340
she is the least mutated mutant
ever born.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.911
And yet, she's cursed

degrading life of a mutant.
