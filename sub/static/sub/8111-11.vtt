WEBVTT

00:18.144 --> 00:19.224
TAU B:
Pressure.
/ need pressure.

00:19.312 --> 00:20.392
JESSICA:
Give me sutures...

00:20.605 --> 00:21.640
TAUB:
We need an Epi.

00:21.731 --> 00:22.971
JESSICA:
Alert trauma.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.994
(EXHALES)

01:10.696 --> 01:11.856
(BEEPS)

01:15.826 --> 01:17.657
Let the record show
that we are officially

01:17.745 --> 01:19.861
convening
a disciplinary hearing

01:19.956 --> 01:24.791
regarding the events
on February 3rd, 2012,
in patient room 209.

01:24.919 --> 01:28.002
Dr. House, this recording
will be transcribed
and published

01:28.089 --> 01:31.126
along with all supporting
documentation and rulings.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.546
Do you have any questions
before we get started?

01:34.637 --> 01:35.717
Yeah.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.300
Who the hell are you?

01:40.434 --> 01:44.143
I'm Walter Cofield.
Chief of Neurology,
Mercy Hospital.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.891
I'll be deciding
your fate today.

01:55.241 --> 01:56.697
Cofield.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.569
You were the Residency
Director at Hopkins
before you moved to Mercy.

02:01.831 --> 02:04.072
Which means
it's safe to assume
that you trained Foreman.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.031
Which means it's
also safe to assume
that he trusts you.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.788
This hearing isn't
about me, Dr. House.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.209
I know you'd like
to make it about me

02:09.297 --> 02:11.879
because then
it wouldn't be
aboutyou.

02:11.966 --> 02:15.379
It's interesting that
he picked the old mentor
to judge the new one.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.721
Interesting,
but not relevant.

02:18.014 --> 02:19.470
The facts of this case,

02:19.598 --> 02:22.931
on the other hand...
The facts are
in the file.

02:23.019 --> 02:25.431
If you have trouble
reading my handwriting,
give me a call.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.762
I'm going back to work.

02:28.566 --> 02:32.479
If I just consider the file,
the facts aren't
in your favor.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.691
The facts say
you should be suspended.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.112
Which,
from what I understand,

02:37.199 --> 02:38.359
would mean
a revocation
of your parole.

02:58.471 --> 03:01.588
The patient was
a 32-year-old high school
chemistry teacher.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.059
He collapsed
while out jogging.

03:04.143 --> 03:05.974
He was paralyzed in
all four extremities

03:06.062 --> 03:07.222
despite the fact
that the scans...

03:07.313 --> 03:10.521
...show no sign of stroke
or structural lesions.

03:10.608 --> 03:12.348
Did you put out
an APB for a car

03:12.443 --> 03:14.684
with a man-shaped
dent in the grill?

03:14.779 --> 03:17.270
No broken bones,
no signs of trauma.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.777
Transverse myelitis.
Bonng.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.449
No enhancement
on the MRI.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.787
| just don't know
what to do.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.204
Please, you have to
help me solve this thing.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.293
A little poetic license.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.708
What are you doing?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.006
Taking my vic-amins.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.390
Those are Vicodin?

03:43.474 --> 03:44.805
Did you have
surgery recently?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.507
About a decade ago.

03:46.811 --> 03:49.177
My leg is no good
atjudging time.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.895
Were you taking Vicodin
during this case?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.358
(SIGHING) Uh...

03:53.609 --> 03:54.724
Yes.

03:58.030 --> 04:01.193
And during
about nine years'
previous cases.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.441
(CLATTERING)

04:03.536 --> 04:05.401
My process is proven.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.698
Good things usually happen.
Bad things sometimes happen.

04:11.127 --> 04:14.711
And when bad things happen,
we should figure out
what went wrong

04:14.797 --> 04:16.958
so we can learn from it
and correct it.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.755
So we can assign blame.

04:18.843 --> 04:22.802
Instead of recognizing
that bad things
sometimes happen.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.847
It was nobody's fault.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.769
And then what happened?

04:35.401 --> 04:38.939
Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.520
Those who can't teach,
teach gym.

04:41.740 --> 04:46.109
And those who can't
move their arms or legs
teach us to laugh at others.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.989
House actually
presented the case
in that way?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.571
Or are you just trying
to make him look bad?

04:51.208 --> 04:54.041
Why would I be trying
to make him look bad?

04:54.128 --> 04:55.789
Could be your
not-so-subtle way

04:55.880 --> 04:57.996
of implying
this was House's fault.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.289
Given what's happened,
it's understandable

05:00.384 --> 05:02.090
that your opinion would
color your testimony.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.255
But I just want to
know what you said,
what you did

05:04.346 --> 05:06.678
and what you were
thinking at the time.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.973
I don't think
it was his fault.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.137
Just tell me
your initial theory.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.731
I thought the patient
had a liver problem.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.059
Hepatic encephalopathy
explained why he passed out,

05:20.154 --> 05:21.940
why he couldn't
move his limbs.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.689
But that's not the idea
House went with?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.612
He thought Taub's idea
was stupid.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.405
And what about
your idea?

05:29.497 --> 05:31.158
He thought that
was stupid, too.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.283
(LAUGHS)

05:32.374 --> 05:34.410
No. I meant,
what was it?

05:34.585 --> 05:38.373
Oh. I thought
the patient had normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.580
And why did House think
that was stupid?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.255
HOUSE: Oh, come on.

05:42.635 --> 05:45.798
Unless you're an idiot,
you know why I thought
Park was an idiot.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.593
The patient had
low opening pressure
on his LP.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.848
That's what I said.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.555
No, you idiot.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.303
The patient had
low opening pressure
on his LP.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.565
Try unsquinting your eyes
and reading the labs
next time.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.019
That wasn't me.
The chair squeaked.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.650
You're testifying
for the record

06:05.741 --> 06:08.858
that you actually
used the phrasing,
"unsquint your eyes"?

06:09.078 --> 06:10.443
This is not the place to
exorcise your guilt,

06:10.538 --> 06:11.653
I just want to
know exactly...

06:11.747 --> 06:17.162
I actually
used the phrasing
"unsquint your eyes."

06:19.463 --> 06:21.374
He's hypokalemic,

06:21.465 --> 06:22.921
could indicate
a problem with his heart,
which would...

06:23.008 --> 06:24.168
EKG was normal.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.420
HOUSE: But, Chase,

06:25.553 --> 06:26.884
a doctor who
actually takes the time

06:26.971 --> 06:29.257
to read the lab reports,
has a point.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.755
The guy's
potassium is off.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.680
Could be
thyrotoxic paralysis.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.885
Start him on steroids, PTU,
and beta blockers.

06:36.689 --> 06:37.974
Mmm-hmm.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.979
And how did
these orange smudges
get on the patient file?

06:44.572 --> 06:47.029
Seriously?
That's your follow up?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.825
I eat a lot of Cheetos,
I forget to wash my hands.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.536
Is my snacking
really relevant
to this case?

06:54.665 --> 06:58.499
Might be, if these were
actually Cheetos stains.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.701
What are they?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.838
Seriously, House?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.591
You're blaming me?

07:11.682 --> 07:13.718
You used Adams' shampoo.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.641
I didn't do it.

07:18.731 --> 07:21.017
HOUSE:
It was a harmless prank.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.103
My team is made up of
Type A personalities.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.152
They need somebody
to break the tension
every once in a while.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.900
So this was a team
building exercise?

07:29.450 --> 07:30.781
Is that what
he called it?

07:30.868 --> 07:32.199
It's what he implied.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.948
House prefers
chaos over cohesion.

07:35.039 --> 07:39.203
He believes that
disagreement and mistrust
lead to better ideas.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.534
He's not wrong.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.668
As opposed to
being right?

07:46.216 --> 07:47.717
So you treated
with steroids.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.587
And then what happened?
They worked.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.963
Our patient woke up.

07:51.055 --> 07:52.340
EMILY: Bill?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.641
Can you hear me?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.010
Yeah.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.224
I'm thirsty.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.270
That's normal.
You've been in a coma
for several hours.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.143
Can you tell me
your name?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.360
Bill. Bill Koppelman.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.817
Can you tell me
what happened to me?

08:07.905 --> 08:09.395
We're treating you for
an overactive thyroid.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.401
We think that's
why you passed out
and couldn't move.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.153
Can you wiggle
your fingers for me?

08:15.287 --> 08:16.572
Is he going
to be okay?

08:16.664 --> 08:19.326
Excuse me,
but only family members
are allowed.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.791
It's okay.
They're my students.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.503
Everyone back at school
is so worried about you.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.455
Is he sick because
of the explosion?

08:30.135 --> 08:31.341
What explosion?
What explosion?

08:32.304 --> 08:33.419
What explosion?

08:33.597 --> 08:36.304
A chemistry demonstration
he was doing for
his class went wrong.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.973
Then why was it
not already in
the patient history?

08:38.060 --> 08:39.925
Because the patient
was unconscious.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.012
But I'm assuming
Dr. House spoke
to the wife.

08:44.108 --> 08:45.894
The wife didn't know
about the explosion.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.774
And I was the one
who questioned her.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.943
So if there was
an oversight,
it was mine.

08:52.825 --> 08:55.612
Does Dr. House
not attach importance
to patient histories?

08:55.703 --> 08:57.614
No. He thinks
they're crucial.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.864
He just doesn't think
being in the same room
as the patient is crucial.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.242
House thinks
avoiding patients

09:05.337 --> 09:07.714
allows him to
stay as objective
as possible.

09:10.426 --> 09:11.632
He's not wrong.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.803
That sounds like
a very diplomatic way
of saying he's lazy.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.679
That's also true.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.507
Either way,
I'm covered.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.057
If you want an accurate
patient history,

09:21.145 --> 09:22.806
don't ever talk
to the patient.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.477
Everybody lies.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.734
Except me.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.149
To you.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.396
Would never do that.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.602
Okay. Say you're right.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.774
If you had
actually been in the room
questioning the patient,

09:36.869 --> 09:38.450
you could read
bodylanguage,

09:38.537 --> 09:40.949
you could ask
follow up questions,

09:41.039 --> 09:44.406
and warn him
of the cost
of lying to you.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.617
Don't forget thumbscrews.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.787
Can you dispute
the possibility

09:49.882 --> 09:53.215
that had you visited
the patient sooner,
maybe talked to the wife,

09:53.552 --> 09:54.883
been directed to
one of the students,

09:54.970 --> 09:57.962
that this case might have
ended very differently?

09:59.892 --> 10:03.055
BILL: It wasn’t exactly
an explosion.

10:03.353 --> 10:07.471
It was a controlled reaction
that went a little haywire.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.272
JORDAN: It was, too,
an explosion.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.896
Simon Harris
filmed the whole thing
on his camera phone

10:11.987 --> 10:13.318
and posted it
on YouTube.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.896
It got, like,
over 75,000 hits already.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.198
Looks like you've
gone viral, hon.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.695
(GAGGING)

10:20.037 --> 10:21.368
(RETCHING)

10:22.831 --> 10:26.289
He had a loss
of consciousness,
temporary paralysis,

10:27.461 --> 10:30.043
but when Iwas told
that the patient
coughed up blood,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.291
things really started
to get interesting.

10:36.178 --> 10:39.591
Your patient was
doubled over in pain
and coughing up blood.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.421
And you found
that interesting?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.473
Why, is that bad?

10:46.230 --> 10:47.970
It's interesting.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.187
I do this demonstration
every year.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.739
But I usually
have a student aide
help me set it up.

10:59.910 --> 11:03.869
Apparently this year
he added extra
hydrofluoric acid,

11:03.956 --> 11:05.162
which is why
it exploded.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.865
The student aide was
just trying to
make a viral video,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.791
not hurt anyone.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.709
Ended up doing both.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.171
So we figured
the patient inhaled
the extra large dose

11:14.258 --> 11:15.589
of hydrofluoric acid,
and...

11:15.717 --> 11:18.094
...burned his lungs,
which is why he
coughed up blood.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.927
If only burnt lungs
explained the passing out
and paralysis.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.175
The explosion does.
Check out the video again.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.882
He smacked his head
against the wall.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.093
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem

11:27.187 --> 11:30.645
that would have led
to the eventual loss of
consciousness and paralysis.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.432
So we discussed it
a little longer

11:33.527 --> 11:36.860
and House decided to
treat with heparin.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.691
I wouldn't mind
a couple more details.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.653
It was aerosolized heparin.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.204
You skipped over
the actual DDX,

11:48.292 --> 11:50.783
and now you're
averting your eyes.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.622
I'm growing more
and more curious
by the moment.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.125
(SIGHS)

11:57.926 --> 11:59.632
He smacked his head
against the wall.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.927
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem

12:02.014 --> 12:05.222
that would have led
to the eventual loss of
consciousness and paralysis.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.886
HOUSE: Nobody move.
Ugh!

12:08.020 --> 12:09.351
He had on a what?

12:09.438 --> 12:10.769
Gas mask.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.693
The stink bomb
was Chase's.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.442
He was getting revenge
for the orange hair

12:21.533 --> 12:24.445
and rigged it
in House's office.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.656
But House found it.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.750
Mmm-hmm.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.376
You can leave when
l have an answer.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.124
Might help if
we knew the question.

12:36.214 --> 12:40.423
How do we treat
chemical burns
inside the lungs?

12:40.510 --> 12:44.219
Maybe we can use
a bronchoalveolar lavage
to wash them out with water.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.672
Sorry, my fault,
I should have clarified.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.890
How do we treat
chemical burns
inside the lungs

12:48.977 --> 12:50.513
without killing
the patient?

12:50.604 --> 12:53.562
Silver sulfadiazine
works well
on chemical burns.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.731
HOUSE: Burn cream
would drown him
faster than water.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.850
Well?

12:58.987 --> 13:00.693
Aerosolized heparin.

13:02.616 --> 13:03.731
Me likey.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.281
CHI: But that's
only experimental,

13:05.369 --> 13:06.905
it's never actually
been used before.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.075
Not true.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.703
It's been used
in sheep.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.075
Uh-huh.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.577
The guy was
going downhill fast.

13:16.672 --> 13:20.130
We needed a treatment
that was a slope changer.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.208
So you busted out
the sulphur dioxide
stink bomb?

13:22.678 --> 13:24.293
It was a team
building exercise.

13:24.388 --> 13:26.504
No, it was manipulation.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.180
You were pressuring
your team into coming up
with unsafe medical ideas

13:29.267 --> 13:30.598
just to get out
of that room.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.723
You say pressure,
lsayinspne.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.895
The usual, safe ideas
were not going to work.
Aerosolized heparin might.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.977
And everyone else just
went along with this?

13:41.613 --> 13:46.277
No. I told House
I thought
it was a mistake.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.824
And those were
your exact words?

13:48.745 --> 13:51.282
I think I might
have said "insane."

13:51.373 --> 13:53.739
You thought it was insane
and yet you let it happen.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.869
No, l...

13:54.960 --> 13:56.871
If you disagree
with Dr. House
on patient safety, Doctor,

13:56.962 --> 13:58.247
it is your duty
to speak up.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.544
Otherwise,
you're equally to blame.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.871
I did speak up.
I tried.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.706
And you failed.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.214
And that's why I went
to Dr. Foreman.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.682
The heparin could
cause the patient

14:12.769 --> 14:15.226
to bleed into his lungs
even faster.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.519
It is crazy.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.348
But House doesn't do crazy
just for crazy's sake.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.817
If he thinks
this is the only way
to help the patient...

14:26.366 --> 14:29.324
COFIELD: You did not
tell me you were
involved in this case

14:29.411 --> 14:30.696
when you asked me
to do this.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.702
I wasn't.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.040
The heparin decision
didn't have anything
to do with the outcome.

14:38.295 --> 14:41.207
If signing off on
everything House does
is a pattern,

14:41.339 --> 14:42.715
it affects
the way House behaves,

14:42.799 --> 14:46.087
it affects the way
House's team reacts
to the way House behaves.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.501
House

14:49.473 --> 14:50.588
is brilliant.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.221
because I've seen
what he can do.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.473
Getting House
out of prison

14:57.564 --> 15:01.557
is the biggest decision
you've made as Dean
of Medicine, right?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.983
And if he's suspended
as a result
of this hearing,

15:04.071 --> 15:06.938
he violates his parole
and he goes back.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.320
And that probably
leaves you as former
Dean of Medicine.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.448
I suppose so.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.115
You didn't choose me
to oversee this

15:18.210 --> 15:20.201
because you thought
I could be objective,

15:20.295 --> 15:23.128
you chose me
because you thought
I'd have your back.

15:23.215 --> 15:27.208
And I'd think twice
about making a decision
that would get you fired.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.344
Eric,

15:32.390 --> 15:33.550
I'm sorry.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.424
But if your
get-House-out-of-jail-free

15:36.520 --> 15:39.182
experiment blows up
in your face,

15:39.523 --> 15:42.265
it's not my job to
get you out of it.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.691
After you'd
administered the heparin,

15:52.786 --> 15:54.447
I see there was
a discharge order
in the chart.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.153
Yet the patient
never left.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.156
House ordered
a therapeutic bath first,

15:59.251 --> 16:02.539
to wash off
any residual chemicals
from the blast

16:03.004 --> 16:04.585
but we wound up
finding something.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.963
JESSICA: You have
a bit of a rash.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.711
Can you raise
both your arms?

16:08.802 --> 16:11.418
We just need to
see how far it goes.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.426
And now there's still
something wrong with me.

16:18.562 --> 16:21.929
It probably
doesn't mean anything,
but we want to make sure.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.102
Of course you do.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.442
I gotta get out
of here. Okay?

16:27.529 --> 16:28.814
JESSICA: Just relax.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.111
Please just let me
get out of here.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.153
It'll just
take a minute.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.526
We need to
get a good look
at the rash.

16:32.659 --> 16:37.995
The rash? That was nothing.
Just some irritation
from lying in bed all day.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.573
The problem was
the patient's brain.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.916
He freaked out.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.876
Igoﬂa
get out of here.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.836
Igoﬂa
get out of here!
Easy.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.459
JESSICA:
"Freak out" is
a little strong.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.922
In my opinion at the time,
it was the rash that
was going to kill him.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.128
Invasive strep.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.304
Reasonable theory,
supported by the evidence.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.928
The evidence pointed
to psychosis.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.053
We caused it
by giving him steroids
when he first came in.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.016
What'd you think?

17:04.149 --> 17:06.014
I thought Park and Adams
were both right.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.350
But that their conclusions
were both wrong.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.317
The neuro symptoms
and the rash

17:10.405 --> 17:12.771
were both signs of
an underlying disease.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.407
Together with the lung,
it added up to Wegener's.

17:18.830 --> 17:22.573
How does Dr. House handle it
when three smart doctors

17:22.667 --> 17:25.204
come up
with three different,
but equally valid ideas?

17:25.295 --> 17:27.126
I run a diagnostic trial.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.547
HOUSE:
Start the patient on
high dose steroids.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.096
Multiple birds,
single stone.

17:38.642 --> 17:41.805
If Taub is right,
then he can walk
out of here cured.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.386
If Adams is right,
he will spike a fever,
get hypotensive,

17:44.481 --> 17:47.223
we can treat it
and he can walk
out of here cured.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.601
If Park is right
and he goes all
Cuckoo’s Nest on us,

17:50.695 --> 17:52.276
we can cross
"brain" off the list...

17:52.364 --> 17:54.480
...diagnose him,
and he can walk
out of here cured.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.239
Are you trying to
make this easy for me?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.862
By your own admission,
if you give
the patient steroids,

17:58.995 --> 18:01.111
two of the three outcomes
could make him worse.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.743
What's making
the patient worse
was not having a diagnosis.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.824
This was the fastest way
to get it.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.201
It was the perfect
diagnostic moment.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.916
In light of
what happened,

18:11.007 --> 18:14.215
do you still think
it was the perfect
diagnostic moment?

18:17.097 --> 18:18.212
Yes.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.720
My theory accounted for
all the medical outcomes.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.515
It did not account
for the disobedience
of my own team.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.278
What are you doing?

18:35.365 --> 18:37.401
I think you're right
about the strep.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.399
Canthuﬂ
to biopsy the rash
while we're waiting.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.409
Thanks.

18:44.582 --> 18:48.370
At the time,
it seemed like
a good idea.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.540
I know this is hard.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.962
But please tell me
exactly what happened next.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.721
CHASE: Draw up
a little anesthetic.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.266
JESSICA:
Two cc's Lidocaine.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.060
Get away from me!

19:11.359 --> 19:12.314
(GASPS)

19:12.402 --> 19:13.562
(GRUNTING)

19:21.411 --> 19:23.572
Bill, you're in
a hospital.
Calm down!

19:25.248 --> 19:26.408
(GRUNTING)

19:27.667 --> 19:28.827
Code Grey!

19:28.918 --> 19:31.409
So your position is that
your team's disobedience
caused this?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.664
That's not what I said.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.337
You said
you didn't anticipate
their defiance.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.130
You implied that
all would have
been fine otherwise.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.008
So who do you blame?

19:39.304 --> 19:41.340
Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase?

19:41.431 --> 19:42.762
Or both?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.763
I don't blame either one.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.607
(YELLING)

19:59.949 --> 20:01.325
JESSICA: Code Grey!

20:04.162 --> 20:05.868
Get Haloperidol.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.445
TAUB: Got it.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.618
(GROANS)

20:23.473 --> 20:25.179
Oh, my God, Chase!

20:41.991 --> 20:44.323
Prep the OR!
Get a gurney.
Start an IV!

20:49.165 --> 20:50.325
JESSICA: Come on.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.161
Bleeder's gotta be
in here.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.544
Got it!
Which artery?

20:58.007 --> 20:59.258
It's his heart.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.302
Fortunately,
only the knife tip reached
the cardiac muscle.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.881
Made a laceration
in the left ventricle

21:07.976 --> 21:10.012
about the size of
the tip of my index finger.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.890
At that moment,
he could only stay alive

21:12.981 --> 21:15.393
as long as my finger
plugged the hole.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.306
Hmm.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.858
It could've been me
on the floor.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.776
It should have been me.

21:20.864 --> 21:21.944
It was my theory.

21:22.031 --> 21:25.865
I held the needle
in front of the patient
that set off his paranoia.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.945
If you're looking
for someone to blame,

21:30.540 --> 21:31.620
blame me.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.747
Please continue.

21:37.714 --> 21:38.829
Getting some ectopy.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.580
Coming through!
CHI:
Good carotid pulse.

21:40.717 --> 21:41.877
JESSICA: Regular?
CHI: No.

21:42.719 --> 21:43.674
Got a PVC.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.888
Gotta move it,
people.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.636
My diagnostic test worked.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.184
It proved that the patient
had a steroid induced
psychosis.

21:53.271 --> 21:54.556
That's what you took away
from this situation?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.979
The brain was not a symptom
of an underlying disease.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.727
Your colleague
was stabbed.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.560
Are you telling me
you didn't care?

22:05.325 --> 22:06.314
How bad is it?

22:06.409 --> 22:07.364
TAUB: Bad.

22:07.452 --> 22:08.783
Patch.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.578
Ready.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.700
I can't take my finger out,
he'll bleed.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.122
I don't think
he can take it.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.502
HOUSE: Oxygenation's
100 percent.

22:16.586 --> 22:17.792
He's as ready
as he's gonna be.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.411
We gotta go for it.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.465
JESSICA: On my count.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.591
One, two,

22:25.345 --> 22:26.585
three.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.631
TAUB: Suture.

22:32.977 --> 22:33.966
Got it.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.092
CHI: BP is stable.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.187
Patch is holding.

22:40.443 --> 22:41.808
What was his heart rate?

22:43.112 --> 22:45.148
He doesn't have one.
He's on bypass.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.192
Not Chase, the patient.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.275
You're DDX'ing?

22:51.663 --> 22:53.949
Park, come with me.
Taub's got this.

22:54.123 --> 22:57.251
My friend is here
because you didn't
listen to me.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.792
I did listen to you.
Chase didn't listen to me.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.875
At this point,
being here makes
you feel better,

23:02.966 --> 23:05.173
you're not helping
Chase or our patient.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.004
Fine.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.378
So he just walked out?

23:10.473 --> 23:11.553
There really was
nothing for him to do.

23:11.641 --> 23:12.721
ltspeaksto
a certain callousness

23:12.809 --> 23:14.470
on Dr. House's part,
don't you think?

23:14.602 --> 23:16.058
Who cares if
House was callous?

23:16.145 --> 23:18.101
Are you going to
punish callousness?

23:18.189 --> 23:21.101
But you agree that
empathy is a useful
quality for doctors?

23:21.192 --> 23:22.272
Houseis
not the problem.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.476
Your friend got stabbed.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.436
He may die
from those wounds.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.613
If you had been
in that room, maybe that
could have been you.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.985
I wouldn't have
been in the room.

23:31.494 --> 23:35.032
Implicitly, you just said
that Chase was at fault.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.291
We all knew
a psychotic episode

23:41.379 --> 23:43.461
was one of the three
possible outcomes.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.456
And Chase brought
a scalpel in there.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.799
He endangered Dr. Adams,
he endangered himself,

23:48.886 --> 23:50.842
and he endangered
the patient.

23:53.516 --> 23:54.881
Thank you.

It's a hospital.
There are lots of doctors
that can take care of him.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.754
And your thinking is
that only you guys

25:12.845 --> 25:15.461
are qualified to
sit in this room,
doing nothing?

25:15.973 --> 25:17.349
If you're motivated
by caring,

25:17.433 --> 25:19.594
just bear in mind
he's a dedicated
chemistry teacher

25:19.727 --> 25:23.094

and adoring students
and a baby on the way.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.562
She's not pregnant.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.981
Would it make a difference?
Because I could knock her up.

keep it down?

You're in the PACU.

You've been in surgery.

just wearing off.

Did I have an epidural?

25:51.634 --> 25:52.794

for answering a couple
of questions?

26:37.346 --> 26:40.213
Well, it's not like
I can get up

27:05.166 --> 27:06.326
(BEEPS)

27:10.671 --> 27:12.878
Were you angry
with Dr. House?

27:13.758 --> 27:16.716
It was a prank,
it wasn't uncommon.

27:16.844 --> 27:17.959
So I've heard.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.045
That doesn't mean
you couldn't get angry.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.845
Might actually contribute
to that reaction.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.265
Can I ask why
that matters?

27:25.728 --> 27:28.140
Are you trying to prove
that l was distracted,

27:28.231 --> 27:30.438
that my judgment
was compromised?

27:32.401 --> 27:33.652
Who do you think
was at fault

27:33.736 --> 27:35.146
for what happened
to you, Dr. Chase?

27:35.238 --> 27:38.526
Again,
why does it matter?

27:38.616 --> 27:39.822
You're a smart doctor.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.900
You know what happened here
better than anyone

27:42.036 --> 27:44.493
and you've
worked with Dr. House
longer than anyone.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.957
And I suspect
that you've spent

27:47.959 --> 27:49.790
every minute since
this has happened

27:49.877 --> 27:51.913
trying to answer
that very question.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.914
I don't think it
was anyone's fault.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.169
l was angry
but I wasn't distracted.

28:02.932 --> 28:06.015
And I think
if there's any chance
I'm gonna walk again

28:06.102 --> 28:08.684
it's because
Dr. House is a genius.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.271
What about warmth?
Can you feel the sheets
on your skin?

28:12.400 --> 28:14.937
I just said
I don't feel anything.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.101
Objectivity, House.

28:23.119 --> 28:26.703
What about
posttraumatic syringomyelia?

28:26.789 --> 28:29.280
A syrinx formed in
the subarachnoid space,

28:29.375 --> 28:30.785
blocking the flow of
cerebrospinal fluid.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.209
That'd mean
the damage was permanent.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.544
No.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.630
Forget the nerves.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.715
House, if it's
total paralysis
he must have...

28:40.803 --> 28:42.043
Not necessarily.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.298
Think arteries.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.554
Blood flow to
his spinal column
is cut off.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.017
It's a clot in
the radicular artery.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.136
That could be fixable.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.976
Prep a room
for an embolectomy

28:51.063 --> 28:52.052
and let's get
that thing out of there

28:52.148 --> 28:53.308
before it does
any more damage.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.559
And if it's not a clot?

28:54.650 --> 28:58.484
Then you can ask Foreman
if hospital insurance
covers ramp-vans.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.821
You're through
the aorta.

29:03.159 --> 29:04.399

29:04.493 --> 29:07.826
Sensory level is at L5,
it must be
the descending branch.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.245
Can I see the monitor?

29:09.665 --> 29:11.826
Stop there.
Shoot the dye.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.083
There it is.
TAUB: Don't get
too excited.

29:18.174 --> 29:21.587
We still gotta get it out,
still could have
done permanent damage.

29:25.848 --> 29:28.590
Patient does not have
autonomic dysregulation.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.595
There's blood
in his urine bag.
Kidneys are failing.

to Princeton General

29:34.857 --> 29:36.097

there's a bed available.

29:36.192 --> 29:40.026
Says the doctors here
can no longer be objective
since the stabbing.

29:41.197 --> 29:45.657
In the middle
of a procedure that could
basically save your life,

29:45.826 --> 29:49.114
House is actually trying
to drag people away?

29:49.956 --> 29:51.287
How do you work
with a guy like that?

29:51.374 --> 29:53.865
He wasn't trying to
pull anybody away.

29:54.001 --> 29:56.208
Everyone had
already refused to
work on that case.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.375
He knew the answer.

29:59.006 --> 30:02.794
He wanted to check on me.
But he needed an excuse.

30:03.552 --> 30:06.510
Otherwise he could
be accused of caring.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.848
So your testimony is that

30:11.143 --> 30:13.680
Dr. House's
complete lack of concern

30:13.771 --> 30:15.853
is evidence of
his deep concern?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.021
Did you just do that?

30:27.034 --> 30:28.194
What?

30:34.250 --> 30:35.990
Wiggle your toes.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.921
Do you feel that?

30:52.268 --> 30:53.929
Congratulations.

30:54.270 --> 30:55.931
It was the clot.

of the artery,

30:58.858 --> 31:01.019
when the swelling
goes down,

31:01.110 --> 31:03.943
you should
gain back at least
some of the function.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.531
One more thing. Sorry.

31:14.457 --> 31:18.120
You knew that your patient
was at risk for
a psychotic break

31:18.252 --> 31:21.540
when you brought
a scalpel within
his reach.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.541
Why did you ignore
that risk?

31:26.886 --> 31:29.593
I thought I was right
about the rash.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.137
I would do it again.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.894
I thought so.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.223
That's it?
"I thought so"?

31:43.319 --> 31:45.651
What the hell
does that mean?

31:47.740 --> 31:50.072
You brazenly
defied your boss.

31:51.660 --> 31:55.073
Now that happened
either because Dr. House

31:55.164 --> 31:57.826
has established that
that's okay in his world.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.826
Or his prank war
distracted you.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.624
Or House makes
medicine a game

32:04.715 --> 32:06.330
and you just wanted
to beat him.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.253
Whatever the reason,

32:08.344 --> 32:12.257
it boils down
to the fact that you may
never walk again

32:12.348 --> 32:17.308
because House
created an atmosphere
that promotes recklessness.

Dr. Chase is hurt?

you're sorry...

anything wrong.

40:32.889 --> 40:34.049
House, stop.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.808
Good things usually happen,
bad things sometimes happen.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.597
The fact that
that would-be widow

40:39.730 --> 40:42.346
came in just in time to
sob all over your soft,
mushy heart,

40:42.441 --> 40:44.397
and the fact
that her husband
is going to live,

40:44.568 --> 40:47.105
does not change
whether or not
I did the right thing.

(EXHALES)

41:21.938 --> 41:24.429
How'd you get
the firing wire into
the Vicodin bottle

41:24.524 --> 41:26.389
without me noticing?

41:28.403 --> 41:30.268
Why'd I even have to?

41:31.114 --> 41:32.650
What was the point
of the orange hair?

41:34.368 --> 41:36.029
Your hair smelled
like Adams'.

41:36.286 --> 41:38.993
Since there's no way
you're doing her
without me knowing,

41:39.081 --> 41:40.867
it means you were
just doing her shampoo.

41:41.083 --> 41:44.120
Which means you were
out late drinking
with some new girl

41:44.211 --> 41:46.623
or because there is
no new girl.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.837
You were trying
to make up time
by showering at the hospital,

41:48.924 --> 41:51.461
but you were too lazy
to buy your own shampoo.

41:51.635 --> 41:54.377
So I found a way
to let you know
to not be late.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.465
You couldn'tjust ask me
to stop being late?

41:56.556 --> 41:58.547
What fun would that be?

42:00.727 --> 42:02.888
None of this is fun,
House.

(GRUNTS)

42:13.156 --> 42:16.740
They decided that
your being stabbed

42:18.870 --> 42:20.326
was nobody's fault.

42:31.341 --> 42:32.877
They're wrong.

42:35.846 --> 42:37.211
I'm sorry.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.180
Anything else?

42:44.855 --> 42:46.686
I'm kind of busy.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.189
No. That was it.

43:00.370 --> 43:01.826
I've got it.
