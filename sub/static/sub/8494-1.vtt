www.titlovi.com

00:59.926 --> 01:01.052
Wait!

01:22.182 --> 01:23.877
Are you looking at me?

02:03.857 --> 02:05.882
Hey!

02:05.925 --> 02:07.256
My hair!

02:07.293 --> 02:08.919
Police!

02:08.961 --> 02:10.485
Somebody help!

02:10.530 --> 02:12.498
Wait, the bus!

03:32.679 --> 03:34.112
You're late, Pecker.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.273
Sorry, Mr. Bozak.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.112
I was taking pictures.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.618
Late is late no matter what.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.313
Finish this order.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.230
I'll be right there.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.339
You got customers.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.059
Here, Miss Emily.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.995
Don't forget to come to my show.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.368
Remember,
this ain't no art gallery.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.872
It's a restaurant.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.106
Your friends better
buy something tomorrow...

04:37.143 --> 04:38.542
or I'll throw them out.

05:36.402 --> 05:39.030
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Asshole.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.006
Hope to see you tomorrow.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.803
Bye.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.916
Here you go, Pecker-man.
Special delivery.

05:54.954 --> 05:56.285
Where'd you get this?

05:56.322 --> 05:58.984
I got myself
a five-finger discount.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.186
Dude, you're gonna get popped.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.717
Not me, bro.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.093
I'm invisible.

06:05.598 --> 06:06.724
Ready to play?

06:06.766 --> 06:08.893
Shopping for others!

06:21.948 --> 06:24.280
Hey, you! Brats.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.648
Next in line, please.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.564
Would you hurry up, please?

07:51.604 --> 07:52.798
This is not mine.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.773
I don't care if it's not...

07:54.807 --> 07:56.069
This is not mine.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.609
I wouldn't eat these rice cakes.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.977
What is this?

08:02.014 --> 08:03.709
I didn't buy this.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.052
There's nothing wrong
with my butt.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.246
Watch your mouth.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.952
I don't eat meat.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.685
I'm a vegetarian.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.558
I'll be right with you.
Hold on.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.393
I'm sorry.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.557
Void that receipt.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.396
It's OK, ma'am.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.631
Just a minute.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.765
What's going on?

08:28.808 --> 08:31.868
Some jerk
in the produce department.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.174
Hey, you!

08:40.253 --> 08:43.154
Stop, thief! Somebody help me.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.350
You gonna pay for that?

09:16.188 --> 09:17.348
Hi, Shelley.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.427
I got fluff and fold duties.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.986
Just a few pin-up shots.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.764
You can't work every second
of your life.

09:30.803 --> 09:34.170
But I don't have all day
for your stupid art.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.401
I gotta refill
the change machines...

09:36.442 --> 09:38.205
unpack the mini-soaps.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.014
Beautiful.

09:43.049 --> 09:47.042
How could I be beautiful
with all the dirt I put up with?

09:47.086 --> 09:49.418
I don't know, but you sure are.

09:51.223 --> 09:53.123
See him?

09:53.159 --> 09:55.354
Ring around the collar.

09:58.564 --> 10:00.156
Chin up.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.632
Lean into the light.

10:02.635 --> 10:03.795
And her.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.327
You wouldn't believe
the B.O. Stains on her blouses.

10:09.308 --> 10:12.300
You're so sexy when you work.
You know that?

10:12.345 --> 10:16.509
How can I be sexy when I know
that she has dingleberries?

10:18.150 --> 10:19.515
She does?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.144
Yes siree, Bob.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.314
You're my Venus de Milo.
You know that?

10:25.358 --> 10:28.850
You're crazy. You see art
when there's nothing there.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.798
Hey, buddy, no sitting
on the washing machines.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.939
You, no slamming doors
on the dryer.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.941
Trying to make me deaf?

10:44.176 --> 10:45.507
One more shot.

10:46.545 --> 10:49.241
Oh, God,
it's a Pecker moment.

10:50.549 --> 10:51.880
Oh, my God.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.811
You can't dye your clothes here!

10:56.856 --> 10:58.687
I don't have any fall colors.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.784
Laundromats have rules.
Can't you read the sign?

11:02.895 --> 11:06.058
Get out, and take your tired
wardrobe someplace else!

11:06.098 --> 11:08.123
You're barred from
the Spin n' Grin Laundromat...

11:08.167 --> 11:10.226
for the rest of your life!

11:22.882 --> 11:24.816
Look.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.341
I killed a worm.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.086
I got you something.

11:31.123 --> 11:32.488
Goody.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.288
Let's say hi to Mom.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.326
I don't know, Joyce.

11:37.363 --> 11:41.060
Miss Betty, I think it looks
very fashionable.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.727
The layered look
is in this year.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.429
Hi, Mom.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.664
Hey, Peck.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.866
What do you think?

11:47.907 --> 11:50.000
Looks cool.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.534
I found a pair
of Calvin Klein underpants, too.

11:53.579 --> 11:55.911
Good for you.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.883
Outsider Al, Miss Betty,
get together.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.044
Come on, Al.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.178
Go on.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.346
There's a good-looking couple.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.221
Fresh!

12:06.258 --> 12:09.523
Sir, everything on that rack
is half price.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.861
Check the tag and divide by two.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.991
Every day is a sale here.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.303
You really know how to make
homeless people feel good...

12:20.339 --> 12:21.670
about how they look.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.972
Thanks, hon. We know how
to make a dollar holler...

12:25.010 --> 12:26.773
here at the Bargain Hut.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.746
You know what I always say.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.806
If you've got 15 cents
in your pocket...

12:30.850 --> 12:34.513
I can make you look
like a million dollars.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.180
I want more candy.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.452
Little Chrissy,
you just had a candy bar.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.016
Your teeth are gonna rot
out of your head.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.688
I said I want candy!

12:45.197 --> 12:47.165
Don't mind Miss Tooth Decay.

12:47.199 --> 12:48.496
She's all sugared up.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.593
Ain't that a beaut?

12:50.636 --> 12:52.570
Twenty-five cents. Want a bag?

12:52.605 --> 12:53.731
I'll wear it out.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.264
Didn't I say the word "candy"?

12:56.308 --> 12:57.969
I loved the seventies, too.

12:58.010 --> 13:02.310
Somebody please
give me some candy!

13:02.348 --> 13:05.249
Would you mind taking
Little Chrissy home for me?

13:05.284 --> 13:07.616
She's been aggravating me
all day.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.621
Sure, Mom.
Come on, Little Chrissy.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.025
I thought you could use this
for your show.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.926
Thanks. You rule.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.763
This darn claw machine!

13:56.802 --> 13:58.463
It's rigged!

13:59.371 --> 14:01.931
You can't be a winner
every time, Guzzles.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.942
Have a drink.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.534
I'm broke, Jimmy.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.445
Your damn claw machine
got all my money.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.947
It's on me, old-timer.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.313
Thanks.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.385
- Hey, Pecker.
- Hey, Dad.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.445
Afternoon, Guzzles.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.979
Hi, Chrissy. How you doing?

14:19.992 --> 14:21.459
How's it going?

14:21.493 --> 14:23.290
Always got
that broken-down camera...

14:23.329 --> 14:24.728
his mama found
at the thrift shop.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.125
How's my little
sweet tooth today?

14:31.170 --> 14:32.967
Little Chrissy wants a Jolt.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.666
She does?

14:39.278 --> 14:41.508
Slow day?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.481
Slow's not the word.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.676
I got a shot for you.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.219
Put this in your show.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.394
It's that damn Pelt Room.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.989
How am I supposed to compete...

15:01.033 --> 15:03.092
with a stripper bar
across the street?

15:03.135 --> 15:04.602
Lesbians, I hear.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.434
Showing full bush.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.441
B-E-A-V-E-R.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.875
That's all men want
in a bar these days.

15:14.313 --> 15:15.473
It says it here...

15:15.514 --> 15:17.778
in the Board of Liquor License
rule book.

15:17.816 --> 15:21.274
"Section 12-203, paragraph 3.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.447
"Pubic hair and liquor."

15:23.489 --> 15:25.650
It's just plain illegal.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.138
Let's have a big hand,
gentlemen...

15:48.180 --> 15:50.614
for T-Bone the stripper!

15:53.018 --> 15:56.419
She's all lesbian all the time!

15:56.455 --> 15:58.184
That's why we're here!

15:58.223 --> 16:00.987
What are you looking at,
assholes?

16:01.026 --> 16:03.551
The nastiest girl in Baltimore!

16:03.595 --> 16:05.563
Yeah, baby!

16:05.597 --> 16:07.428
Take it off!

16:07.466 --> 16:09.263
That's it! Come on!

16:09.301 --> 16:10.893
I got it!

16:10.936 --> 16:12.597
We show it all!

16:12.638 --> 16:15.573
You like looking at lezzies,
don't you, suckers?

16:15.607 --> 16:17.074
I love it!

16:17.109 --> 16:18.940
Full frontal lesbian nudity!

16:18.978 --> 16:21.503
You think men got
what women really need?

16:21.547 --> 16:22.775
I got it!

16:25.484 --> 16:27.816
Bush City!

16:27.853 --> 16:29.013
You're wrong...

16:30.389 --> 16:33.483
because this beef curtain
stands alone!

16:33.525 --> 16:35.652
Hey, you little Peckerwood!

16:35.694 --> 16:37.161
I was just looking!

16:37.196 --> 16:39.960
There's no free peeking
in the Pelt Room.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.990
I should tell your father!

16:48.507 --> 16:51.499
One pit beef sandwich
with horseradish and ketchup.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.010
I tell my lady friends...

16:53.045 --> 16:54.979
"Give a man
a pit beef sandwich...

16:55.014 --> 16:57.482
"and he'll be back for seconds."

16:57.516 --> 16:59.541
Best pit beef in town.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.452
There you go. Bottom round...
just the way you like it.

17:02.488 --> 17:03.648
Four dollars.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.051
Keep the change.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.558
Thank you kindly.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.060
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.006
I need to talk to you.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.203
Hi, Memama. How's business?

17:25.243 --> 17:26.836
All Baltimore
loves a pit beef sandwich.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.107
Can I get a shot?

17:28.146 --> 17:29.478
Sure can.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.150
She's doing it again.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.055
She is? When did she start?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.956
Early this morning.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.793
Come in and take her picture
if you don't believe me.

17:44.830 --> 17:45.990
Come on.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.862
You open?

17:53.872 --> 17:55.499
Hold your horses!

17:55.541 --> 17:57.475
- I'm hungry!
- Be right back!

17:57.509 --> 17:59.636
I want my pit beef!

17:59.678 --> 18:03.136
Sometimes there's things
more important than pit beef.

18:03.182 --> 18:04.308
Come on.

18:04.349 --> 18:07.409
She's been a regular
blabbermouth all day.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.387
I can't wait.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.446
Wait till you hear her voice.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.624
There she is.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.303
Hi, Mary.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.674
Full of grace!

18:31.710 --> 18:34.474
See? She's talking.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.105
It could be a real miracle.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.376
A real miracle.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.407
Full of grace.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.816
You think so?

18:40.853 --> 18:42.445
I do.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.617
I was blinded by the blue
of Mary's cloak...

18:46.658 --> 18:48.626
when I was just seven years old.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.151
I been praying to her
ever since.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.061
Sure has paid off, hasn't it?

18:53.098 --> 18:54.224
It sure has.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.097
Full of grace.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.660
We hear you loud and clear.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.935
You know what? Why don't
you two sit over there?

19:04.009 --> 19:05.271
Perfect.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.710
You two look like a holy card.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.511
We do?

19:11.550 --> 19:14.178
Wait till you see this picture.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.413
Full of grace.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.581
She likes you!

19:17.623 --> 19:18.851
I like her, too.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.917
Full of grace.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.162
Honey, we're home!

19:28.200 --> 19:30.430
Be right down!

19:30.469 --> 19:32.437
Is Memama up there with you?

19:32.471 --> 19:34.439
We're taking pictures!

19:34.473 --> 19:36.941
She's got customers!

19:36.975 --> 19:38.943
Sweetie, come on. Give it back.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.672
You have to wait
till after dinner.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.942
But I'm hungry now!

19:42.981 --> 19:46.747
Everything always looks good
through here.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.318
Where are you going?

19:50.355 --> 19:52.016
I'm making Sloppy Joes
for dinner.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.322
I can't stay.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.452
You've got to eat.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.622
Why do you think
we called him Pecker?

19:58.664 --> 20:00.461
Never did eat properly
as a child.

20:00.499 --> 20:01.830
Just pecked at his food.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.131
I'm not hungry.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.160
Besides, I'm late for
my photo shoot with Tina.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.968
We love your big sister...

20:09.007 --> 20:10.975
but you know how we feel...

20:11.009 --> 20:13.102
about that place
where she works.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.510
The devil's workshop!

20:16.682 --> 20:18.309
At least they don't
show pubic hair.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.977
That's one good thing.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.486
Honey, don't say "pubic"
in front of Little Chrissy.

20:22.521 --> 20:24.489
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetie.

20:24.523 --> 20:27.083
Please bring me a soda!

20:27.125 --> 20:28.820
Bye, Dad.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.691
Don't be too late.

20:46.878 --> 20:48.345
Evening, Mr. Nellbox.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.679
- How you doing, daisy bait?
- Good.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.014
Still taking them pictures?

20:53.051 --> 20:55.281
As long as it's OK with you.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.515
I told your sister Tina...

20:57.556 --> 21:00.024
"Pecker ought to forget
about his stupid camera...

21:00.058 --> 21:02.458
"get on the bar and dance."

21:02.494 --> 21:04.962
Show his bony ass,
make some real money.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.966
Thanks, sir,
but I could never do that.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.695
Can I take your picture, though?

21:09.735 --> 21:12.465
Knock yourself out, buttplug.

21:12.504 --> 21:13.801
Hold still.

21:13.839 --> 21:16.069
I'll hold it
any way I can get it.

21:17.509 --> 21:18.976
See you later.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.342
Have a ball, kid.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.483
Here you go, champ.

21:25.517 --> 21:26.677
There you go.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.416
Thanks. Another beer?

21:31.456 --> 21:32.616
Another beer.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.920
Let's hear it
for Larry the Lughead!

22:08.994 --> 22:11.121
Larry's 21 years old...

22:11.163 --> 22:14.326
heterosexual, uncut,
on probation...

22:14.366 --> 22:16.357
and currently makes his living
as a burglar.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.035
Come on, baby!

22:20.072 --> 22:24.168
How about Seafood Sam
the Sailor Man?

22:31.350 --> 22:34.148
He may be straight,
but he's on leave...

22:34.186 --> 22:38.088
so don't ask, don't tell,
just get him to a hotel.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.358
Thar she blows!

22:47.432 --> 22:49.297
Bull's-eye!

22:52.270 --> 22:54.363
Hey, Larry...

22:55.374 --> 22:57.569
No teabagging.
You know the rules.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.509
No balls on foreheads.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.513
Teabagging is forbidden
here at the Fudge Palace.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.673
I understand.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.945
You teabag a customer
one more time...

23:05.984 --> 23:08.748
and Mr. Nellbox
will fire your ass.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.622
You're gonna like this one.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.094
Look at this.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.658
Be careful.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.232
If it wasn't for you,
Pecker-man...

23:24.269 --> 23:26.464
I'd never know
this shit existed.

23:26.505 --> 23:27.972
"Teabagging"?

23:28.006 --> 23:30.736
Jesus. I thought
I had heard of everything.

23:30.776 --> 23:33.745
Dude, have you ever heard of
giving someone a Dutch oven?

23:33.779 --> 23:35.246
What's that?

23:35.280 --> 23:37.305
It's when you fart in bed...

23:37.349 --> 23:39.681
and quickly pull the covers
over your partner's head.

23:41.019 --> 23:43.681
I gotta try that sometime.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.485
Damn.

23:45.524 --> 23:46.718
Look at her.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.020
She's scary.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.584
I don't know.
I think she looks proud.

23:52.564 --> 23:55.533
Whatever it is,
it's a cool fucking picture.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.535
You sure got the eye
for this stuff.

23:57.569 --> 23:58.968
It's weird.

23:59.004 --> 24:01.973
Sometimes I'm amazed
they even turn out at all.

24:02.007 --> 24:05.374
There's my girl.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.571
Shelley sure is something.

24:08.513 --> 24:10.947
She ought to take off work
once in a while.

24:10.982 --> 24:12.449
Have some fun.

24:12.484 --> 24:16.614
Work is fun, Matt, if you're
doing something you love.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.452
I guess, but look at me.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.890
I'm the best thief in town,
and I can't even get laid.

24:24.629 --> 24:25.994
You hear them footsteps?

24:27.165 --> 24:28.325
It's her.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.767
Quick. One more shot.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.348
Little Chrissy.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.619
Say, "Sugar."

24:57.662 --> 24:59.493
Sugar.

25:00.699 --> 25:03.031
I love you.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.964
No matter what.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.959
This one I like OK.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.258
It's out of focus...

25:32.297 --> 25:34.458
but it ain't depressing
like the others.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.694
Makes people
feel like buying something.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.805
Can I help you?

25:40.839 --> 25:42.466
They aren't even in color.

25:42.507 --> 25:45.305
You can't look at the pictures
without ordering something.

25:45.343 --> 25:47.675
- I'll have a macaroni salad.
- Right.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.414
Look.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.974
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.987
Here you are. Macaroni salad.

25:56.021 --> 25:57.545
Can I get you something?

25:57.589 --> 26:00.558
Hi, Mr. Bozak.
That's all right.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.787
We're just here
to look at the art.

26:03.995 --> 26:07.431
Little Chrissy
can't eat outside food in here.

26:07.465 --> 26:10.195
And they have to buy something.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.271
I'm sorry.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.432
All right.

26:15.473 --> 26:16.940
You can't have it.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.272
Four medium Cokes then.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.302
I want my Jujy Fruits!

26:21.346 --> 26:24.440
We're not allowed outside food.

26:24.482 --> 26:25.949
You're getting a Coke.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.451
We're here to look at art.

26:27.485 --> 26:28.747
Get the Cokes.

26:28.787 --> 26:29.947
Honey, I said...

26:29.988 --> 26:31.979
I want my Jujy Fruits!

26:32.023 --> 26:34.958
You're going to have a Coke
in a minute!

26:34.993 --> 26:38.326
Congratulations.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.830
Thanks.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.456
Here you go, Little Chrissy.

26:41.499 --> 26:44.195
Who's that in the picture?
Is that Little Chrissy?

26:44.235 --> 26:46.965
That's one of my favorite ones,
too.

26:47.005 --> 26:49.473
Sweetie, you are so talented.

26:49.507 --> 26:53.307
If only you could concentrate on
pretty scenery or something...

26:53.345 --> 26:54.972
instead of our boring lives...

26:55.013 --> 26:57.106
you might make a real career
out of this.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.943
Get back to work.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.258
That's me!

27:07.292 --> 27:10.125
It's a miracle
they don't take it down.

27:10.161 --> 27:12.152
I know what you mean.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.099
You believe these pictures?

27:16.134 --> 27:17.931
What in the...

27:18.970 --> 27:21.768
I can't figure out
what this one is...

27:21.806 --> 27:23.171
but I kinda like it.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.468
Those homos.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.980
Your pictures are glorious.

27:34.285 --> 27:37.345
There's nothing gay about it.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.461
I'm sorry I'm late...

27:43.495 --> 27:45.463
but wait till you try
this new product.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.965
It removes lipstick stains,
deodorant rings.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.627
Thanks, honey.
That's really sweet.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.070
Can I take a short break?
It won't be long.

27:54.105 --> 27:55.834
Come on. Please?

27:55.874 --> 27:57.466
You're off the clock then.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.977
Just for five minutes.
Come on.

28:00.011 --> 28:04.277
And you two, don't even think
about using the rest rooms.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.218
Look. It's all you, Shelley.

28:10.255 --> 28:11.916
Oh, my God.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.821
You look so pretty.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.292
You don't think I show too much?

28:16.327 --> 28:18.625
That's why they call them
figure studies.

28:18.663 --> 28:20.927
What will my customers say?

28:20.965 --> 28:22.933
They'll say you inspire me.

28:22.967 --> 28:25.697
It's just me
in my stupid Laundromat.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.295
What's the big deal?

28:28.640 --> 28:29.800
Excuse me.

28:29.841 --> 28:31.433
Are you Pecker?

28:31.476 --> 28:33.068
I am.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.373
I'm Rorey.

28:34.412 --> 28:36.607
- We're his parents.
- Hi.

28:36.648 --> 28:39.981
I'm from New York City
where I have an art gallery.

28:40.018 --> 28:41.986
I'm here to meet
with the Baltimore Museum...

28:42.020 --> 28:43.282
and I saw your flyer.

28:43.321 --> 28:44.788
Your pictures are amazing.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.723
They're the real thing.

28:46.758 --> 28:48.225
Thanks.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.659
This is my girlfriend Shelley.

28:50.695 --> 28:52.959
I love your look.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.157
Tell me about this one.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.269
It's...

29:04.075 --> 29:05.565
It's kind of...

29:10.482 --> 29:12.382
It's the pubic hair
of a stripper!

29:15.620 --> 29:17.417
That's it.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.423
This is a family restaurant,
and you're fired!

29:19.457 --> 29:21.425
I should hope so.
That was disgusting.

29:21.459 --> 29:22.585
Fired?

29:22.627 --> 29:24.788
What did I do?

29:24.829 --> 29:27.195
Chrissy, don't eat that, honey!

29:27.232 --> 29:28.392
Look, Chrissy...

29:28.433 --> 29:29.923
Hurry up! I gotta go!

29:29.968 --> 29:31.367
Go!

29:31.402 --> 29:33.302
Listen to Daddy.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.966
You want to get rickets?

29:39.511 --> 29:41.274
How much?

29:41.312 --> 29:42.745
For my picture?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.112
You wanna buy it?

29:44.149 --> 29:46.014
Of course. It's great.

29:47.852 --> 29:49.717
- Thirty dollars.
- Sold.

29:49.754 --> 29:52.951
Mom, Dad, I just sold a picture.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.757
I'd also love to give you a show
in my New York gallery.

29:57.495 --> 29:58.962
There you go.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.624
Look.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.991
There's another opening
down the street.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.493
- At Pat Hearn's Gallery.
- Got good reviews.

30:29.527 --> 30:31.222
Why don't we give it a chance?

30:31.262 --> 30:32.524
All right.

30:42.707 --> 30:44.004
That's my little sister.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.669
Some wine?

30:45.710 --> 30:47.177
May I?

30:47.212 --> 30:48.372
Certainly.

30:48.413 --> 30:49.744
Isn't she a doll?

30:52.650 --> 30:53.844
Darling!

30:56.054 --> 30:59.023
My God, you've gotta listen
to what they're saying.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.456
This is The Times.

31:00.491 --> 31:01.549
"A teenage Ouija...

31:01.593 --> 31:03.458
"who's paintbrush
is the broken-down camera...

31:03.494 --> 31:05.462
"he found
in his mom's thrift shop."

31:05.496 --> 31:09.364
Lester Hallbrook never raves
about anybody's first show!

31:09.400 --> 31:10.731
He's over there.

31:12.003 --> 31:13.937
Thanks a lot, sir!

31:13.972 --> 31:15.701
You don't have to do that.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.476
Look at this one.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.000
I saw that book at the Strand.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.479
There's Venetia Keydash.
She's a writer for Art News.

31:23.514 --> 31:25.311
I want to introduce you to her.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.874
Your pictures are sublime, son.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.442
Thanks a lot, ma'am.

31:28.486 --> 31:30.215
If I knew how
to make 'em any better...

31:30.255 --> 31:32.587
they probably
wouldn't work at all.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.402
You know what?
Excuse me a second.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.338
Isn't he gorgeous?

31:51.376 --> 31:52.502
He is.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.636
We don't have boys that cute
in New York.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.015
You having fun, hon?

31:58.049 --> 31:59.516
How could I?

31:59.550 --> 32:01.450
These people
don't go to Laundromats.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.147
They go to dry cleaners.

32:06.491 --> 32:07.958
Here's who I wanna meet.

32:07.992 --> 32:10.961
Shelley, this is one
of the biggest collectors...

32:10.995 --> 32:13.463
of modern photography
in New York, Lynn Wentworth.

32:13.498 --> 32:17.093
You are so sexy, young lady,
and you don't even know it.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.095
Sometimes I know I look good.

32:20.138 --> 32:22.163
You know, Shelley...

32:22.206 --> 32:24.640
she runs a successful Laundromat
in Baltimore.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.645
I know she does, and I bought
all 12 pictures of it.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.839
You did?

32:32.951 --> 32:36.478
One thousand, three hundred
dollars for one picture?

32:36.521 --> 32:39.115
I really didn't do anything.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.183
Here you go. Gypsy, right?

32:45.530 --> 32:47.623
Honey, no.

32:47.665 --> 32:48.996
That's enough chocolate.

32:49.033 --> 32:51.501
We're gonna have
a big fancy dinner soon.

32:52.870 --> 32:54.064
You are rich!

32:56.674 --> 32:58.835
They really are
something special.

32:58.876 --> 33:01.606
Pecker's like
a humane Diane Arbus.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.479
But with a wonderful
streak of kindness.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.944
I'll be right back.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.475
Excuse-moi.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.518
Hi, Mary.

33:13.558 --> 33:14.923
That's me.

33:14.959 --> 33:16.290
I beg your pardon?

33:16.327 --> 33:18.295
I work in a gay bar
in Baltimore.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.160
We call everybody "Mary."

33:22.467 --> 33:25.265
You got a little sugar in you,
don't you? Sure. I can tell.

33:25.303 --> 33:27.362
A little light in the loafer.

33:27.405 --> 33:29.464
I don't mean nothing.
I love fags.

33:29.507 --> 33:32.874
I'm Jed Coleman,
curator at the Whitney.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.810
This is Lester Hallbrook
of The Times.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.976
Your brother is a very
talented individual.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.178
You got that, Mary.

33:43.521 --> 33:46.957
I can't believe
you want my autograph.

33:46.991 --> 33:48.481
I don't know.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.016
There you go.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.528
It looks so fun.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.826
- Let's do it at Balducci's.
- Where's that at?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.833
Wouldn't they just die
at Dean & Deluca's?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.994
Is that a store?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.162
Gourmet anarchy.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.000
You can steal for me any day.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.064
Do you get aroused
when you shoplift?

34:04.976 --> 34:06.944
I guess so.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.411
Would you girls like
to get together later?

34:10.514 --> 34:13.449
I'd like to introduce you
to Redd Larchmont.

34:13.484 --> 34:14.643
Redd!

34:15.987 --> 34:18.956
This is Pecker...
and Shelley, who's so lucky.

34:18.989 --> 34:22.221
Pecker, darling, I must have
"Little Chrissy's Sugar Fix."

34:24.395 --> 34:26.862
The whole edition
of that one's gone.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.422
Look at "Rats Make Love."

34:28.466 --> 34:29.989
It's one of my favorites.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.098
There's Cindy.

34:34.138 --> 34:36.163
Who?

34:36.206 --> 34:38.175
Cindy Sherman...
the famous photographer?

34:38.208 --> 34:39.676
Right.

34:39.710 --> 34:43.077
Hey, Cindy!
Thank you for coming to my show!

34:47.918 --> 34:50.478
- Hi, Jed. How are you?
- Very nice.

34:50.521 --> 34:51.748
Coming through.

34:51.789 --> 34:52.983
Excuse me!

34:53.024 --> 34:55.492
Ladies and gentlemen,
here she is!

34:55.525 --> 34:57.494
Full of grace.

34:57.528 --> 34:58.654
That's right.

34:58.696 --> 35:02.962
Our Lady herself, Mary...
right here in New York City.

35:04.001 --> 35:05.935
I promise you it'll be OK.

35:05.970 --> 35:07.767
Seriously. I'm Pecker's mother.

35:07.805 --> 35:09.033
It's fine.

35:09.073 --> 35:10.233
Honey. Hi.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.641
Here. Hold my purse
and watch Little Chrissy for me.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.176
Be right back.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.315
You got spare change?

35:21.352 --> 35:22.478
Spare change?

35:22.520 --> 35:26.047
You poor thing.
You must be so hungry. Here.

35:26.090 --> 35:28.320
Thank you.
Can I have your jacket?

35:28.359 --> 35:29.951
Sure.

35:29.994 --> 35:31.894
Certainly you can.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.397
There you go.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.492
Don't they have good
thrift stores in New York?

35:37.535 --> 35:38.968
No, ma'am.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.470
They're so expensive.

35:40.505 --> 35:45.135
Where I come from, you can get
an Easter outfit for 25 cents.

35:45.176 --> 35:46.939
You can?

35:46.978 --> 35:49.845
Fuckin' lousy art galleries
are ruining this neighborhood!

35:49.881 --> 35:52.850
Stupid blank paintings
and out-of-focus pictures...

35:52.884 --> 35:55.114
and those ugly ass sculptures!

35:55.153 --> 35:57.986
Sir, I understand.

35:58.022 --> 36:00.252
I know.
It's really hard, isn't it?

36:00.291 --> 36:02.521
It's hard to appreciate
new things...

36:02.560 --> 36:05.427
if you don't have
the proper outfit to wear.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.658
Take this. Accessorize.

36:07.698 --> 36:09.893
Tie it around your neck.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.993
Don't be afraid of fashion.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.132
That looks wonderful.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.437
It's a whole new you.

36:17.475 --> 36:18.942
Listen up.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.945
They're having
this artist's dinner...

36:21.979 --> 36:23.947
at this place
called the "B" Bar...

36:23.981 --> 36:25.608
after my son's opening.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.117
You all should come.

36:27.151 --> 36:30.712
Free food, and who knows,
maybe you'll get a new outfit.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.131
Excuse me, Lynn.

36:49.173 --> 36:51.971
Shelley,
you're right next to Pecker.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.237
See you later.

36:55.012 --> 36:57.173
I was wondering where you were.

36:58.849 --> 37:01.545
Do you believe this?
We're in a nightclub.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.945
Is this your first time
in New York?

37:04.989 --> 37:07.253
You bet.
Is all this free?

37:07.291 --> 37:08.918
The depth and maturity
of his work.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.188
It's fantastic.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.389
There's Bryce.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.022
Hi, Collin. Hi, Pat.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.932
Be careful of that guy
over there.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.595
He's from Coagulum.
It's a magazine.

37:21.472 --> 37:22.700
You're so good.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.443
- Here you are, ma'am.
- How fancy.

37:26.477 --> 37:27.967
For you, miss.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.450
Don't be frightened.

37:33.484 --> 37:34.917
These are just vegetables.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.310
They won't hurt you.

37:39.323 --> 37:40.950
I'd like to propose a toast.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.756
To Pecker:
A brilliant photographer...

37:43.794 --> 37:47.286
a sweet boy,
and a brand-new art star.

37:47.331 --> 37:48.593
To Pecker.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.225
To Pecker!

37:54.672 --> 37:56.833
You have to stand up.

37:56.874 --> 37:58.535
These people are here for you.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.373
- Speak.
- Oh, God.

38:00.411 --> 38:01.469
It's your night.

38:01.512 --> 38:03.980
I shouldn't have taken off work.

38:04.015 --> 38:07.075
I should be at home
in my Laundromat doing my job.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.449
I'm sure it'll be OK.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.421
Thank you all
for being so nice to me...

38:15.459 --> 38:17.427
and buying my photographs.

38:18.496 --> 38:21.624
I wanna thank Rorey
for liking my pictures...

38:21.666 --> 38:24.157
even though some
are out of focus...

38:24.201 --> 38:26.999
and sometimes I don't
get the exposure right.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.938
You don't know
what my customers are like.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.431
They wait for me to leave town
so they can defy my rules.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.943
You're just imagining things.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.104
I'm not.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.479
People with their dirty laundry
can be animals.

38:38.516 --> 38:42.111
I'd like to toast my dad
for teaching me how far to go.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.620
Take a bow.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.451
He's a great guy, isn't he?

38:45.489 --> 38:48.947
Is it legal to show pubic hair
in New York?

38:48.993 --> 38:50.358
I'm not really sure.

38:50.394 --> 38:52.362
And my grandmother...

38:52.396 --> 38:54.193
for teaching me
to believe in myself...

38:54.231 --> 38:56.028
no matter what anybody said.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.092
She's a real saint.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.194
Full of grace.

39:00.237 --> 39:02.296
My customers will do anything
if I'm not there.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.900
They could be pissing
in my dryers as we speak!

39:04.942 --> 39:07.536
It's going to be OK.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.103
And my big sister Tina...

39:10.147 --> 39:13.913
for helping me to understand
all types of human behavior.

39:13.951 --> 39:18.388
Come down to Baltimore,
the trade capital of the world!

39:18.422 --> 39:20.549
Thanks, Tina.

39:20.591 --> 39:22.684
And my little sister Chrissy...

39:22.727 --> 39:24.627
Want a Valium, honey?

39:26.364 --> 39:30.528
For teaching me life is nothing
if you're not obsessed.

39:30.568 --> 39:32.798
Honey, you're flinging.

39:32.837 --> 39:37.604
And Matt, the best assistant
a photographer could ever have.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.973
Without him,
I couldn't even do my work.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.500
He's a big help.

39:45.216 --> 39:50.085
And my mom, for helping me
pick out my outfits.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.950
Actually, she helps us all
pick out our clothes.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.960
You look beautiful, Mom.

39:56.994 --> 39:58.393
Give her a hand!

39:58.429 --> 39:59.862
Can I have your blouse?

40:02.099 --> 40:05.694
This is a private dinner.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.203
We're on the list.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.069
You're gonna have to leave.

40:09.106 --> 40:10.801
They're sort of with me.

40:10.841 --> 40:14.368
You said
we could get new clothes!

40:14.412 --> 40:16.073
Do you know these people?

40:16.113 --> 40:17.580
I didn't know.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.981
I thought someone
could help them.

40:20.017 --> 40:21.985
It's OK.

40:22.019 --> 40:24.249
Everything's different
in New York, right?

40:24.288 --> 40:25.983
I shouldn't even be in New York.

40:26.023 --> 40:29.857
I'm a Baltimore girl,
and that's where I should stay.

40:29.894 --> 40:31.828
And most importantly,
to my girlfriend Shelley.

40:31.862 --> 40:35.696
To Shelley, the real reason
I take pictures at all.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.928
To Shelley!

41:32.790 --> 41:34.849
Honey, what does this mean?

41:34.892 --> 41:37.986
"...Pecker's
delicious photographs...

41:38.028 --> 41:41.657
"of his culturally
challenged family."

41:41.699 --> 41:42.996
"Culturally challenged"?

41:43.033 --> 41:45.001
I don't like the sound of that.

41:45.035 --> 41:46.866
That's just art nonsense.

41:48.706 --> 41:51.004
That's me in the paper.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.508
Are you homosexual?

41:52.543 --> 41:54.010
I'm not.

41:54.044 --> 41:56.035
You wouldn't understand then.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.016
Do you think this stuff is OK?

42:00.050 --> 42:01.984
Sure.

42:02.987 --> 42:04.955
This is a big article.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.479
"A stain goddess"?

42:06.524 --> 42:10.324
The Village Voice called me
a stain goddess.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.852
I just means you look good.

42:12.897 --> 42:16.355
Hey, what are you doing later?

42:22.606 --> 42:25.575
Maybe I'll be
in the Catholic Review.

42:25.609 --> 42:29.204
You're gonna be a holy day
of obligation, Mom.

42:29.246 --> 42:30.645
Here's the part I like.

42:30.681 --> 42:33.149
"Over 62 of Pecker's
edition prints...

42:33.183 --> 42:37.586
"were sold for prices
as high as $1,300 each."

42:37.621 --> 42:39.885
They have that in the paper?

42:45.029 --> 42:46.963
It's our stop.

43:00.044 --> 43:01.443
Oh, my God.

43:01.478 --> 43:02.604
Mom, Dad.

43:02.646 --> 43:04.238
What?

43:06.650 --> 43:08.447
They've seen your pictures.

43:08.485 --> 43:10.453
I'm out of here.
See you later.

43:10.487 --> 43:11.977
Let's check it out.

43:14.158 --> 43:15.955
Hold it, buddy.

43:15.993 --> 43:17.290
Officer, it's our house.

43:17.328 --> 43:18.625
Have we been robbed?

43:18.662 --> 43:19.959
I'm afraid so.

43:19.997 --> 43:21.965
But don't worry.
They're long gone.

43:21.999 --> 43:23.466
Did they get my hot rollers?

43:23.500 --> 43:25.661
I hear you're rich.

43:30.007 --> 43:31.201
TV is gone.

43:31.241 --> 43:32.902
So is the VCR.

43:32.943 --> 43:34.069
I'll check upstairs.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.976
How about the kitchen?

43:36.013 --> 43:37.981
Nobody's hurt.
That's what's important.

43:38.015 --> 43:39.983
See what happens
when you leave Baltimore?

43:40.017 --> 43:42.485
Thank God Mary was with me.

43:42.519 --> 43:44.009
Oh, God. My darkroom.

43:46.256 --> 43:49.225
My Liza Minnelli CDs are gone!

43:49.259 --> 43:52.820
They ate the cookies, too!

43:52.863 --> 43:54.990
The negatives,
they're all here.

43:55.032 --> 43:56.499
So are the prints.

43:56.533 --> 43:59.195
They didn't even want my stuff.

44:01.472 --> 44:04.441
They took the clock-radio
and your electric shaver.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.466
I wonder if they were cute.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.906
Sweetie,
did they take your cookies?

44:10.948 --> 44:14.577
It's no wonder we were robbed
with that Pelt Room nearby.

44:14.618 --> 44:16.643
Pubic hair causes crime.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.152
Full of grace.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.457
It's OK.

44:28.499 --> 44:30.262
I hate vitamins!

44:31.802 --> 44:33.463
It's Rorey. Is Pecker there?

44:33.504 --> 44:34.971
I have fabulous news.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.404
Hold on.

44:38.008 --> 44:39.976
Phone's for you!

44:40.010 --> 44:41.978
We were just robbed.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.639
What do you mean?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.114
Burglarized?

44:47.785 --> 44:48.945
It's Rorey.

44:50.354 --> 44:53.050
Take pictures.
This could be your next show.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.058
Your mom's loss,
your dad's sadness.

44:55.092 --> 44:56.354
Get close-ups.

44:57.594 --> 44:59.994
I didn't even think
to take pictures.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.156
Pictures?

45:01.198 --> 45:02.324
Guess what?

45:02.366 --> 45:05.426
The Whitney Museum wants to
schedule "A Peek At Pecker"...

45:05.469 --> 45:06.936
in their upcoming schedule.

45:06.970 --> 45:09.962
The Whitney Museum!

45:11.809 --> 45:13.276
Pecker's off work.

45:13.310 --> 45:15.301
Call back during business hours.

45:16.814 --> 45:19.009
This is all my fault.

45:19.049 --> 45:21.415
What they call art in New York,
young man...

45:22.653 --> 45:25.144
looks like plain misery to me.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.658
Don't become an asshole.

45:28.692 --> 45:31.092
I beg of you.
Don't become an asshole.

45:41.271 --> 45:43.933
I don't understand this.

45:43.974 --> 45:46.204
"The haunting image
of financial despair."

45:46.243 --> 45:48.575
I was kidding around
with Pecker.

45:48.612 --> 45:50.170
I've still got customers.

45:50.214 --> 45:52.182
We still have food on the table.
Right?

45:52.216 --> 45:54.582
Captain Crunch!

45:54.618 --> 45:56.745
Don't!

45:56.787 --> 45:58.755
My hair's a mess.

45:58.789 --> 46:01.053
You look the same as always.

46:02.626 --> 46:04.753
It's awfully early, isn't it?

46:04.795 --> 46:05.955
I got it.

46:19.409 --> 46:20.569
Thank you.

46:23.413 --> 46:26.280
Rorey... She's always in a hurry.

46:26.316 --> 46:28.443
I was on MTV.

46:28.485 --> 46:30.612
What?

46:30.654 --> 46:33.714
I was talking to Larry
the Lughead on the phone...

46:33.757 --> 46:36.590
and he saw Pecker's picture
of me on MTV.

46:38.228 --> 46:41.254
Oh, Mary, I'm a model.

46:41.298 --> 46:44.961
"Mary" is not
a homosexual term.

46:45.002 --> 46:48.096
Oh, my God! The cover!

46:48.138 --> 46:50.265
Memama?

46:51.475 --> 46:53.204
Oh, my God in heaven.

46:53.243 --> 46:55.006
We're all famous.

46:55.045 --> 46:57.240
Just like the Jackson family.

46:57.281 --> 46:58.976
Don't say that.

46:59.016 --> 47:02.577
I'm gonna show it to Monsignor.

47:02.619 --> 47:04.985
I'd wait. I really would.

47:05.022 --> 47:08.719
Some Catholics
might not understand it.

47:12.629 --> 47:14.096
I'll get it.

47:14.131 --> 47:15.325
Move over, Kate.

47:15.365 --> 47:17.560
Outta my way, RuPaul.

47:17.601 --> 47:19.501
See who it is first!

47:19.536 --> 47:22.027
Her comes Tina, supermodel!

47:25.409 --> 47:27.309
Ciao, ciao, ciao!

47:29.546 --> 47:31.776
I'm Dr. Deborah Klompas.

47:31.815 --> 47:35.478
I'm an M.D. With Baltimore
City Child Protection Services.

47:35.519 --> 47:38.113
And you're Little Chrissy.

47:40.157 --> 47:41.954
How may we help you?

47:41.992 --> 47:45.484
It's more about how I'm
gonna be able to help you.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.430
We don't need anybody's help,
lady.

47:48.465 --> 47:50.990
Protection Services
saw Little Chrissy...

47:51.034 --> 47:52.968
in the Sun papers.

47:53.003 --> 47:55.096
There's nothing wrong
with Little Chrissy.

47:55.138 --> 47:56.605
Little Chrissy's wired.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.403
She's just
a sugar-sensitive child.

47:58.442 --> 47:59.739
That's all.

47:59.776 --> 48:01.835
She does fidget.

48:03.447 --> 48:04.641
I'll get it.

48:09.119 --> 48:10.416
More good news.

48:10.454 --> 48:13.287
Hold on. We're in the middle
of a family crisis.

48:13.323 --> 48:15.723
I am sorry to inform you...

48:15.759 --> 48:20.321
but your child has attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder.

48:20.364 --> 48:24.562
She needs Ritalin.

48:30.207 --> 48:31.674
This is important.

48:31.708 --> 48:34.541
Vogue wants to do a shoot
called "Slumming With Pecker."

48:34.578 --> 48:36.307
You have to hold on.

48:39.850 --> 48:41.283
Greg Gorman is the photographer.

48:41.318 --> 48:44.344
He shoots all the celebrities,
and he wants you to model.

48:44.388 --> 48:45.616
I can't talk now.

48:45.656 --> 48:47.487
I'll call you back.

48:47.524 --> 48:49.992
She does climb excessively.

48:50.027 --> 48:52.791
Would she eat better?

48:52.829 --> 48:57.459
You think of these as Mother
and Daddy's little helpers.

48:57.501 --> 49:00.937
Dad, all kids love candy,
though.

49:00.971 --> 49:02.268
It's for her health.

49:03.640 --> 49:06.734
Go ahead and take
your medication.

49:08.045 --> 49:10.479
Come on, Little Chrissy,
give me a pose.

49:27.364 --> 49:28.854
What do you think you're doin'?

49:28.899 --> 49:31.333
You remember me
from the thrift shop?

49:33.337 --> 49:34.804
Wait a minute.

49:34.838 --> 49:36.897
That's my dad's radio.

49:36.940 --> 49:38.407
You robbed our house.

49:38.442 --> 49:40.774
So? You took my photograph
and didn't pay me.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.245
Come on, man.
That's not the same thing.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.577
These are real-life shots.

49:44.614 --> 49:47.447
Fuck you. It's my life,
real or not, asshole.

49:47.484 --> 49:48.849
We're even now.

49:48.885 --> 49:52.116
Wait a minute!
My sister wants her CDs back!

49:53.724 --> 49:55.248
No cops this time, right?

49:55.292 --> 49:56.759
Don't worry about them.

49:56.793 --> 49:58.158
They couldn't catch
a goddamn cold.

49:58.195 --> 49:59.628
Your pictures are everywhere.

49:59.663 --> 50:01.153
Tell me about it.

50:01.198 --> 50:04.224
I'm trying to get new stuff,
but everyone knows me now.

50:04.267 --> 50:06.565
I know. No doubt.

50:10.674 --> 50:11.868
Here.

50:15.278 --> 50:18.179
Don't even try it.

50:18.215 --> 50:20.206
That's my private garbage.

50:20.250 --> 50:23.117
Sorry. No hard feelings, I hope.

50:23.153 --> 50:25.018
Get a real job.

50:25.055 --> 50:27.615
You stole from charity.

50:27.657 --> 50:29.147
I'm callin' Jerry Lewis.

50:34.364 --> 50:37.356
I didn't sign no model release,
and I'm gonna sue your ass.

50:37.401 --> 50:39.130
He didn't even get paid yet.

50:39.169 --> 50:41.569
What would you know, fartmouth?

50:41.605 --> 50:43.903
The gallery gets half his money.

50:43.940 --> 50:46.534
You can suck my fat ass, Matt.

50:46.576 --> 50:49.568
Do you think
I should move to New York?

50:58.688 --> 50:59.916
Can I help you?

50:59.956 --> 51:01.981
I think we're just looking.

51:11.902 --> 51:13.995
Do you have any Guess jeans?

51:14.037 --> 51:15.937
This ain't GQ, buddy.

51:15.972 --> 51:18.839
We got real clothes
at regular prices.

51:18.875 --> 51:21.002
Just trying to look my best.

51:22.446 --> 51:23.811
How about Jordache?

51:23.847 --> 51:25.337
I just told you.

51:44.668 --> 51:46.033
Any Kathie Lee?

51:46.069 --> 51:47.559
Sold out.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.847
I'd like to fill out
a job application.

51:58.882 --> 52:01.282
I knew it was you, stupid.

52:01.318 --> 52:03.445
And you're Peckerhead, right?

52:03.487 --> 52:04.647
Pecker, ma'am.

52:04.688 --> 52:07.418
I saw those pictures, dumbbells!

52:09.426 --> 52:10.893
You're both caught.

52:10.927 --> 52:12.861
I was gonna put it back, honest.

52:12.896 --> 52:14.523
We did it for the art.

52:14.564 --> 52:16.555
Art-schmart.
Give me that camera.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.058
Give me that camera,
or I'm callin' the cops.

52:21.771 --> 52:24.069
OK, you two. Whip it out.

52:24.107 --> 52:25.369
What?

52:25.408 --> 52:29.105
I said take out your units.

52:32.716 --> 52:34.183
Look, we're sorry.

52:34.217 --> 52:37.209
I said unzip!

52:44.461 --> 52:47.430
That's what I call
a Peckerprint.

52:47.464 --> 52:49.364
Smile.

52:49.399 --> 52:51.367
You're on Candid Camera.

52:54.571 --> 52:57.096
I've never been caught
shoplifting in my life.

52:57.140 --> 52:59.233
Maybe this will
teach you both...

52:59.276 --> 53:01.767
that some people
don't feel like being art.

53:01.811 --> 53:05.076
If I can't steal,
I don't want to be famous.

53:05.115 --> 53:06.309
I quit.

53:06.349 --> 53:09.682
We're sorry. Matt's a thief,
but he's a nice person.

53:12.489 --> 53:15.458
Is this the stain goddess
I heard about on Howard Stern?

53:15.492 --> 53:17.255
How do I get rid
of Pecker-tracks?

53:17.294 --> 53:18.761
Eat one, asswipe.

53:18.795 --> 53:21.855
Be a good little girl and put
your vagina to the phone.

53:21.898 --> 53:23.627
Shove it, fuckwad.

53:30.840 --> 53:33.274
Stop taking my picture!

53:33.310 --> 53:34.800
You're ruining my life!

53:34.844 --> 53:37.904
I'm sorry. I thought
I was making your life better.

53:37.948 --> 53:40.883
Want to take my picture?

53:42.352 --> 53:43.785
You can't do that in here.

53:43.820 --> 53:46.311
Go to New York.
They love that stuff.

53:46.356 --> 53:48.415
Take my picture. Please?

53:54.264 --> 53:55.561
Don't you dare.

53:55.599 --> 53:57.897
Come on!
Before my quarters run out!

53:58.802 --> 54:00.269
Spin n' Grin.

54:00.303 --> 54:01.429
It's me.

54:01.471 --> 54:03.439
I sold three prints
of you today.

54:03.473 --> 54:04.940
Is Pecker there?

54:04.975 --> 54:06.135
Another obscene call.

54:06.176 --> 54:08.201
It's your girlfriend, asshole.

54:10.146 --> 54:12.774
Can I work in peace?

54:13.817 --> 54:15.785
Hi, honey. It's me, Rorey.

54:15.819 --> 54:17.480
Did you get my little present?

54:52.422 --> 54:54.788
If this is Pecker,
don't call back.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.334
Spin n' Grin.

55:07.370 --> 55:08.837
It's me, Peck.

55:08.872 --> 55:10.863
A dryer overheated,
and some idiot flashed me.

55:10.907 --> 55:13.034
Call Rorey.
Maybe she feels like talking.

55:29.292 --> 55:30.987
Could you get that door?

55:37.067 --> 55:41.629
Are you sure this outfit is...
the way it's supposed to be?

55:41.671 --> 55:43.571
- Looks great.
- Turn this way.

55:43.606 --> 55:45.733
Let's see the Polaroid.

55:45.775 --> 55:47.402
Stop mauling me! Get off!

55:47.444 --> 55:48.570
Background ready?

55:48.611 --> 55:50.408
Five minutes.

55:50.447 --> 55:51.573
Hold still.

55:51.614 --> 55:54.378
I'd never wear this ugly rag.

55:54.417 --> 55:55.975
It's comme des garçons, darling.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.850
You should be so lucky.

55:57.887 --> 55:59.047
Close your eyes.

55:59.089 --> 56:00.351
Don't tell me about fashion.

56:00.390 --> 56:03.587
Mr. Gorman, I'm not so sure...

56:03.626 --> 56:06.891
Pecker is so comfortable
about modeling today.

56:06.930 --> 56:08.522
But your son's
a fashion natural.

56:08.565 --> 56:10.226
He's going to look great.

56:11.201 --> 56:13.669
Can I see?

56:13.703 --> 56:15.034
Shake your head, darling.

56:18.675 --> 56:20.438
I look like a simpleton.

56:20.477 --> 56:24.140
You with the rash, put this on.

56:24.180 --> 56:26.114
My scalp itches.

56:28.651 --> 56:30.585
Look at Mommy.

56:30.620 --> 56:33.748
Honey, look at Mommy.

56:35.658 --> 56:38.684
What? Oh, sweetie, is it time
for your medication?

56:38.728 --> 56:40.696
Here we go.

56:40.730 --> 56:42.823
I don't know about these pills.

56:42.866 --> 56:45.334
Here. There you go, sweetie.

56:45.368 --> 56:46.892
Wash it down.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.137
You don't want any soda?

56:49.172 --> 56:52.403
I wouldn't wear this
to the shelter, you twit!

56:52.442 --> 56:54.910
Don't fight me, darling.
You can wear this anywhere.

56:54.944 --> 56:56.343
You trying to blind me?

56:57.947 --> 57:02.509
Jesus, what the hell
have you done to my mother?

57:02.552 --> 57:04.019
I look silly, don't I?

57:05.688 --> 57:07.622
What a beauty.

57:07.657 --> 57:10.524
I'm not a beauty.
I'm a photographer.

57:10.560 --> 57:14.656
Please, I'm more comfortable
on the other side of the camera.

57:14.697 --> 57:17.860
You know what?
I don't want to be in Vogue.

57:18.501 --> 57:21.937
Everybody wants to be in Vogue.

57:21.971 --> 57:23.836
Background action.

57:23.873 --> 57:28.207
Miss Betty, Al,
you don't have to do this.

57:28.978 --> 57:30.445
Are they getting paid?

57:30.480 --> 57:33.278
Nobody went over this with me.

57:33.316 --> 57:35.011
Wait. I said no.

57:35.051 --> 57:36.450
Don't we get food?

57:37.454 --> 57:40.355
Did anyone hear me?
We're not doing this.

57:40.390 --> 57:41.857
Get the hell off me.

57:41.891 --> 57:43.654
Al, Miss Betty, stop it!

57:43.693 --> 57:46.560
You don't have to model
if you don't want to.

57:47.597 --> 57:50.896
He's poor... he's white...

57:51.901 --> 57:53.562
but he sure ain't trash.

57:53.603 --> 57:55.935
God! I don't want to be a model.

57:58.975 --> 58:00.567
Oh, my God.

58:00.610 --> 58:01.907
What's the matter?

58:01.945 --> 58:03.503
She's choking to death!

58:03.546 --> 58:05.241
Take a sip.

58:05.281 --> 58:07.010
Spit it out.

58:07.050 --> 58:09.041
Good. Great.

58:09.085 --> 58:10.552
Somebody please call the doctor!

58:10.587 --> 58:12.077
This is great. Good.

58:12.121 --> 58:15.090
- Stop taking my picture!
- A little over there. Good.

58:15.124 --> 58:17.183
Spit it up.

58:17.227 --> 58:18.990
There, it's all better.

58:19.028 --> 58:21.155
Got your shot?

58:22.999 --> 58:24.660
I guess we can retouch.

58:25.301 --> 58:26.495
The Lord is with me.

58:26.536 --> 58:30.233
I know.

58:30.273 --> 58:31.865
Full of grace.

58:31.908 --> 58:33.500
You sure are.

58:33.543 --> 58:38.173
You're a virgin, a mother,
and you're all mine.

58:46.556 --> 58:47.682
Who is it?

58:47.724 --> 58:51.854
We're the Friends of Mary,
and we've come to see Our Lady.

58:51.895 --> 58:53.385
Be right down.

58:54.898 --> 58:57.799
It's all right. Be right back.

58:57.834 --> 59:00.359
- They can't do this.
- Look at that baby.

59:01.804 --> 59:04.796
Goddamn it! Pig!

59:04.841 --> 59:06.103
Long live bush!

59:06.142 --> 59:07.734
Cover it up.

59:07.777 --> 59:09.574
Get off me, motherfucker!

59:09.612 --> 59:11.443
Shave it off!

59:11.481 --> 59:13.210
Pubic hair harassment!

59:13.249 --> 59:15.217
Beaver brutality!

59:15.251 --> 59:17.549
Pubic hair is against the law.

59:17.587 --> 59:19.020
We want bush!

59:24.227 --> 59:26.627
I'll make the money
off my Pelt, not you!

59:26.663 --> 59:30.724
T-Bone! I didn't want anybody
arrested for my pictures.

59:34.604 --> 59:36.003
Thanks.

59:41.878 --> 59:43.072
Thank you.

59:43.112 --> 59:46.445
Can't you see what pubic hair
is doing to this neighborhood?

59:47.216 --> 59:48.945
Sinking your property values!

59:48.985 --> 59:51.112
Get off! I didn't do anything.

59:53.323 --> 59:55.621
These nice ladies
have come to honor you.

59:57.794 --> 59:59.591
Full of grace.

59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.392
You're saying that yourself.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.921
What do you mean?

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.763
You heard me, faker.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:09.329
I need Mary's help.
Oh, you have company.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:11.966
This is my grandson Pecker.

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:15.375
These are the Friends of Mary...
or so they say.

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.844
They're not being nice to her.

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:19.177
We can see her lips moving.

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:21.342
It's just a matter of faith,
ladies.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:22.681
Here. Come on.

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:25.688
Shut your eyes
and think of the color blue.

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:29.180
No, you don't. Heretic!

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:32.450
Maryolatry is not a joke.

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:33.860
Full of grace.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:37.059
This is too much
for my Catholic ears...

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.534
and I'm telling Monsignor.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:43.232
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.637
Blessed art thou among women...

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:47.074
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.011
You can tell the pope
for all I care!

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.513
My grandmother's a saint!

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:58.519
Ask Mary to make my life
like it used to be.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:00.181
I'll try.

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:05.026
Pecker has a request.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:06.255
Come in, Mary.

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:09.264
It's me, Memama.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.469
It's me, and I'm talking to you.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.405
Mary was silent
for centuries, right?

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.739
I guess you can't expect her
to talk on demand.

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.937
Talk, goddamn it!

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.776
It's your pictures.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.751
See what they've done?

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:32.448
They've ruined my miracle.

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:49.594
Come on!

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.270
Right here, waiting.

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:54.469
Come on.

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.411
This is a gay establishment.

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.642
We know.

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:00.979
We're here for the teabagging.

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.484
What teabagging?

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:05.043
We saw Pecker's pictures.
They're hilarious.

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:07.056
Give me that.

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:10.048
Listen up!

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.856
There's no teabagging here...

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.987
and there's no straight people
allowed, either.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.156
What?

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.756
Come on, all of youse.

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:20.326
I need to see some gay I.D.,
or you're out of here.

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:22.964
Take the money.

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:33.749
Who will be
Mr. Rough Trade Baltimore?

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.281
Get away.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.958
Did you hear me?

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.886
Will it be Death Row Dave?

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:54.933
Dave's a three-time loser.

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:58.270
He's sentenced to the chair,
but he's still got a boner!

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.872
His last request...

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:06.109
one more hum job before
they pull the switch.

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:08.915
Here he comes.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:11.943
He's Matt the Thief.

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:15.150
He's barely legal,
but he's got the beef.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:19.893
The kindest face
you'll ever find...

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:23.695
but if you own a store,
he'll shoplift you blind.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.729
You ruined my career.

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.498
I'm sorry.

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:38.905
- Billy Heckman!
- Dad?

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.143
You are queer!

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.982
No, Mom, I'm trade.
The queers blow me.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.519
I don't blow them.
I'm still straight.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.723
You get off that bar
and cover yourself!

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.560
Come here.
Watch your beer, sir.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.463
Come on.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.127
We're getting out of here.

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:02.632
Tina, you're fired.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.133
Oh, God, no, Mr. Nellbox.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:07.767
This is all my fault.

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:08.936
Don't blame Tina.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.138
Please.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.840
Trade is my life.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.018
Because of your pictures...

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:23.719
look what you did
to your sister.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.125
Washing Machine Pervert, right?

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.398
Fabulous.

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.532
I sold this one to L'uomo Vogue.

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:41.637
Good.

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.941
This one... Don't you think
it would be perfect...

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.470
for that special edition...

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:47.573
Parkett magazine
wants you to do?

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.551
Sure.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.553
We got to talk.

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.713
These pictures...

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:01.092
they're just suddenly all shit.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.495
Nonsense.

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.522
Your work just evolved.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.564
Congratulations.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.966
What's this?

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.498
We're doing great.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.713
And for your Whitney show...

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.614
it will be a triumph of pain.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:32.025
That's a terrible poster.

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:45.365
I want to like it. I just don't.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.739
Shelley's out of context.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.471
She's not like this.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.347
How can you be
so kind and gentle...

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.354
and still have talent?

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:02.789
I just try to do good work.

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:06.124
Could we be together just once?

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.356
You mean...

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:10.925
For the Whitney?

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.327
But you're my art dealer.

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.032
That's right. I am...

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:20.065
and I also understand
your vision.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.742
Just once...

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.909
for art.

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.687
Oh, my God!

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:40.127
It's not what you think!

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.925
It's all about the work!

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:44.455
I hate modern photography!

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.907
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for this to happen.

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.671
You're not supposed
to have sex with people...

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.041
you're trying to help.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.378
I didn't plan it.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.044
I like Shelley.
She's a sweetheart.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:07.283
I just wanted a real boyfriend,
not some art person.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.289
Cancel the Whitney.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.621
You can't do that.

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:17.120
I want my friends, family,
and career back!

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.397
Let's talk.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:23.735
Don't leave.
We can work this out.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:26.872
What about New York?

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.343
They can come to me.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.213
I'm going to have my own show
here in Baltimore.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.376
But the Whitney!

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:38.114
What am I supposed
to tell the Whitney?

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:39.712
Shelley, I love you!

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:44.326
I love you more than Kodak!

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:50.725
Wait!

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:55.434
Help, police! He took a dump
without buying anything!

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:57.439
Get off me.

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.441
Police!
I'm making a citizen's arrest!

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.500
Matt, I got paid.

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:05.344
I'll give you a job,
and this time, you're on salary.

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:06.643
All right, Pecker-man.

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:08.206
You're the boss.

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:10.913
Bastards!

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.292
Voting card, please.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:30.037
You can take the second booth
on your right.

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:31.562
Thank you.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.009
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.448
Your voting cards, please?

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.542
I don't have it with me,
but I'm registered.

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:44.746
My name is Pecker.

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:51.116
Excuse me.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.957
Do you have a bathroom?

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:56.692
This is a polling place,
not a filling station.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:57.892
Excuse me.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.895
Voting booths
are private places, Mr. Pecker.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:05.201
If I were you,
I would concentrate...

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:06.970
on my own personal choice
of candidate...

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.738
and not the choices of others.

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:12.404
I really have to use
the bathroom.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.245
One would think
a serious voter...

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.808
would eliminate
before leaving home.

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.747
But it's an emergency.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:22.689
All right. Here.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:23.850
Thanks.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:26.760
It's through that door
and to the left.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:29.354
To the left!

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.732
Mr. Pecker?

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:38.535
I'll be right back.

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:40.201
I'm trying to vote.

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:41.470
Come on.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:44.675
Mr. Pecker, did you hear me?

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:46.510
Oh, God.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.380
Let me stand in your bag.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.979
She can't see me now.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.858
Attention, voters.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:06.425
No two people are allowed
in a voting booth.

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:12.396
More than one person
inside a voting booth...

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.636
is a federal offense...

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:16.201
punishable...

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:21.007
by up to three years in prison.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.109
Please come back.

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:25.586
Without you, my work is shit.

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:27.748
Rorey's your work.

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.553
It's you that I love.

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.557
I don't understand
that art crap.

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:36.154
You could
if you just opened your eyes.

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:38.826
I work in a Laundromat.

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.926
Art's everywhere.

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:43.336
In my endless bags
of dirty laundry.

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:46.204
It is, if you think about it.

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:48.776
What?

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:51.746
The brilliant green
of a grass stain?

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.975
That's art.

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.849
The subtle yellow
of a urine-soaked sheet?

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:58.978
Keep going.

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:00.818
It's what you see every day.

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.721
The aqua blue of cold water...

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:04.589
as it dilutes a violent
red blood stain?

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:07.357
You got it.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:10.490
Be spontaneous
for once in your life.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.625
I'm scared.

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:15.637
The almond brown of a stubborn
mildew stain can be beautiful?

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:19.300
Let your mind go,
and you'll be free forever.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.605
I think I finally see it.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.636
Art.

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.642
Use a condom.

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:54.626
Settle down, folks.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.638
I know we're all excited.

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.799
Take it away.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:00.536
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:03.873
Welcome to Pecker's Place.

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:20.792
We're here with Pecker's
grandmother Memama.

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:23.263
Tell us, why won't Mary talk?

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:24.663
She went up, that's all.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.531
Mary's broke.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:30.163
But if channel 45's viewers
pray hard enough...

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:33.231
maybe Our Lady will speak again.

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:36.005
I'm Sloane Brown,
Channel 45 News...

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.443
live at Pecker's Place.

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:39.140
What's going on?
How you doing?

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.115
You're going through.

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.742
I know you.

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:44.685
Look.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.780
Friends of the Whitney...

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:51.122
this is Baltimore.

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:54.362
Wonderful. Let's get off.

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:00.133
Look...

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:01.864
a row house.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.863
With white marble steps.

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:08.877
It's just like his pictures.

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.970
It's so dignified.

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.537
So powerful.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.641
It's almost sexual, isn't it?

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:17.777
You with the goiter in the back.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.448
How you doing? You.

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:23.652
Excuse me, I'm Jed Coleman.
This is the Whitney group.

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.490
It's four dollars
for each of you.

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:30.192
I didn't know
there was a cover charge.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.166
I thought you liked it
when I stole.

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.199
Congratulations.

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.732
Thank you.

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:43.404
It's not just me.

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:46.039
It's my friends, my family.

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:49.107
Everyone here inspires me.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.551
Pecker sees New York
from the outside looking in...

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:55.114
and if you just open your eyes,
you'll see it, too.

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.853
I see what you mean.

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.862
That skinny lady in the photo...

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.194
That's fucking hilarious.

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:04.756
I love it.

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:13.333
We're open for business.
What do you got to trade?

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:16.173
I do own a bakery.

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.509
How about complimentary
birthday cakes...

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.515
for each member of your family
for two years?

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.244
It's a deal.

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.149
I'm putting it
in my rumpus room.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:32.960
Mr. Coleman,
so glad you could make it.

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:34.553
How does it feel to be
in front of the camera?

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.086
Well, it...

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.023
takes a little getting used to.

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:45.707
Hi, Mary! Welcome to Baltimore.

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:04.857
I didn't know Pecker
was showing this work.

01:16:07.362 --> 01:16:09.922
Pecker, darling.
I want to see lowlife.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:12.729
Show me down and dirty.

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.497
It's just us, Lynn.

01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:16.902
You remember Shelley, right?

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.839
Congratulations.

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:25.272
Oh, my God.

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:27.509
You look daringly original.

01:16:27.549 --> 01:16:29.483
There's not a catalog, is there?

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.351
Nice tits, ma'am.

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:43.188
It's the liquor lady.
Want to dance?

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:46.166
I only had two drinks
that night.

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:47.964
Think I care?

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.402
I drink, too.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.429
Set 'em up.

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:57.011
There you go.

01:16:57.045 --> 01:17:00.014
Oh, Miss Betty,
that looks wonderful.

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.345
I don't know.

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:04.147
Will it wrinkle
if I sleep in it?

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:06.381
Not that fabric.

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:07.854
That's flameproof, too...

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:10.050
in case someone
sets you on fire.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:12.754
All right. I'll take it.

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.284
Good.

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:19.796
Isn't fashion something?

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.498
Here comes the vegan.

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.736
Chrissy's a good little girl.

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.938
She looks so different.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.475
Little Chrissy's off the drugs.

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:37.815
She's sugar-free and on the road
to a balanced diet.

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.343
Thank you, honey.

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:43.453
Come on, gorgeous, be honest.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.982
When was the last time...

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.257
a straight guy
asked you to dance?

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.829
Go on, Venetia.

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:51.992
Get it, girl.

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:53.797
Go on. You're in Baltimore.

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.528
Congratulations, Pecker.
Shelley.

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.133
Thank you.
I'm glad you could come.

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:29.933
This is my new discovery Randy.

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:33.202
He's from New Jersey and is
the first blind photographer.

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:36.608
I feel portraits,
and I smell landscapes.

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.510
I'm giving him a show
in November.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.276
Is that outsider art?

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:42.249
No more light readings.

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.149
No more focusing.

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:46.211
Maybe you should give him
a show in your Laundromat.

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.154
Send me some slides.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.680
I'll do that.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.867
Go, T-Bone!

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:13.781
All right, T-Bone!

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:31.629
No pubic hair!

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:35.859
No vagrants!

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.279
Take your pants off.

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.615
Teabag him, Larry.

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:28.318
Brilliant work.

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:30.586
Thanks, Mr. Hallbrook.

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.689
Shake it, sweetheart!

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:39.429
Ride it, bitch!
Ride it like a butch bottom!

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:42.231
New York was never like this!

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:45.831
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:54.007
She's talking,
and I'm not saying anything.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.040
Full of grace...

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:58.416
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:00.546
Our prayers have been answered.

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:02.557
Full of grace.

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.116
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.287
Grace. Holy.

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:11.294
Grace. God.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:12.800
Holy.

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.699
Do you think
it's a real miracle?

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:29.876
Quiet, please.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.819
Quiet, everybody.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:36.050
Come on in. Gather around.

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:38.286
Pecker, get up here.

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:50.764
I have a toast.

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:52.933
To Pecker.

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.532
To Pecker!

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.544
And the end of irony!

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.080
What's next?

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:09.283
Well...

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.026
I think...

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.328
You know what?

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:18.958
I'm thinking
of directing a movie.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.194
All right!
