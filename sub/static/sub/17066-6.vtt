went missing.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.373
- The Iron Hill murders.

was Eddie.

You guys remember
"Candle Cove?"

It's back.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.411
When the show stopped,
the murders stopped.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.246
Me and Eddie started
playing cards one day,

00:12.280 --> 00:14.082
and this one game
went on and on.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.549
There was no winner.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.218
- You killed your own son?

00:17.251 --> 00:19.520
- I didn't create
"Candle Cove."

00:19.553 --> 00:22.123
Eddie did.
He's coming back

00:22.156 --> 00:23.291
through you.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.260

I don't think he's wicked.

01:05.133 --> 01:08.102

is a rogue and a murderer.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.372
He engineered the mutiny.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.443

what he does.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.214
- Why he kidnapped a kid?

Yeah, she went this way.

I'm only one thing that matters
now, and that's a dad.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.614

04:40.648 --> 04:43.351
and a friend.

- What about your friend
Mike Painter?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.385
And now he wants me to go
join him in it.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.421

for me later on today.

It's Daddy.

they're telling you what to do.

are asking me for something,

- Yeah, I--yes.

So take me to her.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.638

20:15.515 --> 20:17.650
It's Jawbone.

- Yeah, we met.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.988
- That's not his real name.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.761
- What's his real name?

20:28.795 --> 20:30.630
- Skin-Taker.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.440
- Skin-Taker.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.610
- He's not really my friend.

20:43.643 --> 20:47.480
He's part of me.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.782
He keeps me company.

Not you.

for both of us.

It's your turn to be here.

No taking turns anymore.

We belong together.

We shared everything.
Shouldn't we share this?

I'm going anywhere.

I promised to stay,
and I will

it never ended?

Every time my stack
got too low,

Finish the game
with your brother.

The people who hurt us--
their children--

33:28.274 --> 33:30.776
it was a long time ago.

the best I can.

There's still a lot
we don't know

34:07.479 --> 34:09.648
and might never know.

34:09.681 --> 34:13.585
The state task force still
hasn't issued their report,

34:13.619 --> 34:16.355
and it might be some time.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.525
But at this time, I can say

34:19.558 --> 34:23.262
that in addition to the murders
earlier this year

34:23.295 --> 34:27.433
of Daphne Bell and sheriff's
deputy Simon Grove,

34:27.466 --> 34:29.701
Frances Booth was responsible

34:29.735 --> 34:31.870

of Eddie Painter,

34:31.903 --> 34:33.739

34:33.772 --> 34:37.476
Carl Cutter,

34:38.610 --> 34:43.349
So after almost 30 years,

34:43.382 --> 34:45.351
our town can finally
begin to heal

34:45.384 --> 34:46.818
and close the door
on the tragedies

34:46.852 --> 34:49.488
that happened here in 1988.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.357

on the speculation

34:51.390 --> 34:54.526
that children may have been
involved in the Yolen murder?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.362
- The investigation
is still open.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.697
Anything you may have heard
is unsubstantiated.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.499
In the meantime,

I would ask that you refrain
from speculation.
