WEBVTT

00:02.869 --> 00:04.428
Sorry about that, guy.

00:04.504 --> 00:07.963
Try some Merthiolate
or Mercurochrome. It'll help out.

00:09.976 --> 00:12.207
Welcome back to our
<i>Tool Time</i> salute...

00:14.948 --> 00:16.177
- To men!
- To men!

00:16.248 --> 00:18.684
Continuing our show about
everything that men like,

00:18.752 --> 00:20.618
we've got a display you're gonna love.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.816
And our guests are the authors
of the mucho macho book...

00:23.890 --> 00:26.052
<i>The Big Damn Book
of Sheer Manliness!</i>

00:26.126 --> 00:27.560
Heidi?

00:32.198 --> 00:36.569
Nice pelt. Okay, let's bring out
our authors of the book,

00:36.636 --> 00:39.606
Brant and Todd,
the Von Hoffman brothers.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.165
Todd. How're you doing?
Great to have you on the show.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.872
Nice to meet you guys.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.275
I'm Todd.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.508
- I'm Tim.
- I'm Heidi.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.948
- I'm single.
- I'm not surprised.

00:54.487 --> 00:57.514
Quick testosterone quiz.
Man's best friend...

00:57.591 --> 00:58.957
His mother.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.927
It's his dog, you big nellie.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.490
Harsh words coming from
a military man in tasseled loafers.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.634
Yeah, you big... Boss.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.300
Favorite guy movie.
<i>True Grit? Spartacus?</i>

01:15.375 --> 01:18.868
- Oh, yeah...
<i>- My Fair Lady.</i>

01:18.945 --> 01:20.311
<i>- My Fair Lady?</i>
- Yes.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.542
What's wrong with <i>My Fair Lady?</i>
It's a great movie.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.381
"Why Can't a Woman
be More Like a Man?"

01:25.452 --> 01:28.388
Because surgery's too expensive.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.695
Come on. Let's get to the
meat and potatoes of this show.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.157
What's the manliest meal
a man can fix?

01:33.226 --> 01:36.663
- Chili.
- You're darn tooting. Heidi?

01:36.730 --> 01:39.199
And speaking of tooting...

01:39.266 --> 01:41.326
Today we're gonna show you
how to make our special

01:41.401 --> 01:43.495
three-alarm colon cleaner.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.639
All right, guys. What do we do first?

01:47.741 --> 01:50.711
Well, first we've already browned up
a couple of pounds of meat.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.109
Now, we know you like beef.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.545
I love beef. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.982
Well, we prefer rattlesnake. But today
we're going with Al's favorite...

01:58.051 --> 02:00.611
- Lean stewing turkey.
- That's right.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.058
Now, while that's simmering,
you want to add

02:02.088 --> 02:03.989
two cans of chopped, peeled tomatoes

02:04.090 --> 02:06.059
and a bottle of your favorite brew.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.731
And, of course,
there's always a debate about

02:07.761 --> 02:09.286
whether or not beans should be added.

02:09.395 --> 02:14.027
Actually, the debate begins two hours
after you've added the beans.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.605
That's right. What the hell?
We're men, right?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.126
Go for it, baby.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.138
Next you want to put in
your chili mix.

02:19.272 --> 02:22.401
Right. And a manly jalapeño pepper.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.240
Now, if there's women-folk partaking,
you might want to go easy.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.610
Oh, please!

02:28.081 --> 02:30.209
Now, you want to let this stew
for about a day.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.115
But we have a pot here
all ready for tasting.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.490
- All right, Heidi.
- That's great.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.681
Oh, yeah.

02:34.754 --> 02:38.191
Okay. Oh, clumsy me.

02:39.926 --> 02:43.419
- Okay, here you go, boys.
- Thank you.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.159
Oh, I'm sorry... "Men."

02:46.232 --> 02:50.169
Al! Al, not with a spoon. Always eat
three-alarm chili with a saltine.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.864
- Absolutely!
- That's right.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.740
I upped it to eight-alarm just to
weed out the men from the boys.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:02.175 --> 04:05.737
Let me guess.
You're reading the footnotes?

04:05.812 --> 04:08.782
Yeah, that's very funny.
I'm doing physical therapy for soccer.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.942
I gotta put some weight on my knees.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.519
Have you tried standing up?

04:13.653 --> 04:18.887
Here, take that. All right.
Come on, Dad. Lean on me.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.232
- You ready for this?
- Oh, yes.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.058
All right, buddy. Okay, go.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.865
What do they call that? Jerk du Soleil?

04:37.243 --> 04:40.771
I tell you, this kid's getting strong.
Pretty soon he'll be able to lift you.

04:40.847 --> 04:44.807
- Very funny. Ha! Ha!
- All right. I gotta go stretch my quads.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.110
Oh. Hmm.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.015
So, how was your day, baby?

04:48.087 --> 04:52.024
Well, I handed in my thesis
to Dr. Hanover.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.690
Congratulations!
You must feel fantastic!

04:54.761 --> 04:55.801
No. What? Are you kidding?

04:55.862 --> 04:58.627
I have to defend my paper now
in front of this whole thesis committee.

04:58.698 --> 04:59.803
And maybe I won't know the material.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.704
Maybe I won't be able
to answer their questions.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.294
Maybe my whole career will go
into a downward spiral.

05:04.370 --> 05:09.741
Maybe you should see a therapist.
Oh, that's right. You are one.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.368
Say hello.

05:11.444 --> 05:15.506
Oh, Mark! When are you gonna stop
this family documentary thing?

05:15.782 --> 05:17.614
I'm just getting some last-minute shots.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.176
The class is showing our films
a week from Friday.

05:20.720 --> 05:24.213
Great! Now I can make a fool out of
myself in front of a whole classroom.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.519
- Oh, stop. Stop.
- I got it.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.024
- Oh, hi, Gregory. Come on in!
- Hi, Mark.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.227
What's going on?

05:35.301 --> 05:37.668
Mark, I'm having
an anxiety attack about my film.

05:37.770 --> 05:42.538
It's like Antonio Banderas is
doing the lambada on my liver.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.976
I'll see what I can do about it.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.173
Mom, Dad, this is Gregory.
He's in my film class.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.310
- Hi.
- Hello, Gregory. Tim Taylor.

05:53.386 --> 05:56.879
I'd shake your hands,
but human contact makes me queasy.

05:59.926 --> 06:03.419
How do you feel about some
killer chili? You want to stay for dinner?

06:03.496 --> 06:06.989
Sorry.
I can't masticate in front of strangers.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.465
Who can?

06:14.707 --> 06:16.412
I can't believe
I have to waste my Friday night

06:16.442 --> 06:18.001
watching your stupid video.

06:18.077 --> 06:21.570
It's payback for having to watch
you kick your stupid soccer ball.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.646
Guys, this is what family's
all about, you know?

06:24.717 --> 06:26.618
Doing stuff together that you hate.

06:29.522 --> 06:33.015
Oh, my gosh! That's Dr. Hanover.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.962
Call him Dr. Comb-over.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.031
That was a good one.

06:39.365 --> 06:40.937
This guy is head
of the Psych Department.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.334
I have to defend
my thesis to him tomorrow.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.438
Are you sure he shouldn't be
defending his haircut to you?

06:47.607 --> 06:50.509
- Good one.
- Hello, Jill.

06:50.576 --> 06:54.240
Oh, hi, Dr. Hanover.
What are you doing here tonight?

06:54.314 --> 06:56.681
Well, I have a child in the class.
This is Emily.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.116
Oh, hi. It's nice to meet you.
This is my husband Tim.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.551
- Tim.
- And one of my sons, Brad.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.620
Brad.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.658
Our film student's over there
talking to that boy in the corner.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.886
Yeah, that's poor Gregory Winston.

07:08.494 --> 07:11.054
You know,
talk about a psychological case study.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.723
I'd really like to meet his parents.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.166
Well, you'll have to settle for the father.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.760
How do you do?

07:18.838 --> 07:22.002
He's my stepson.
I'm well aware that Gregory has issues.

07:22.075 --> 07:27.207
But in the future, you might not want
to be so quick to share your diagnoses.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.715
I'll see you tomorrow morning,
9:00 a.m. sharp.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.752
Good one.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.057
Attention, everyone.
Find yourselves a seat.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.887
Our young directors have all made

07:43.963 --> 07:47.627
gritty, realistic documentaries
about their families.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.398
And it's my belief that
any one of these budding auteurs

07:51.471 --> 07:55.966
could grow up to direct
the next <i>Rescue 911.</i>

07:56.042 --> 07:58.602
Mark, would you like
to man the video deck?

07:58.711 --> 08:00.976
Damian, the lights.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.944
<i>To say that I'm the black sheep of my
family would be an understatement.</i>

08:07.020 --> 08:10.980
I'm hoping to move up to black sheep.
My mother's a Rhodes scholar,

08:11.257 --> 08:14.591
my father's a Doctor of Psychology.
My biggest accomplishment is

08:14.661 --> 08:16.630
that I flossed this morning.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.256
Gregory, stop that taping and get over
here and eat your chicken!

08:19.365 --> 08:20.799
Yes, Father.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.368
Checkmate again, son.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.641
There's nothing I enjoy
more than playing chess with my father.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.738
Except for maybe
a cerebral hemorrhage?

08:40.119 --> 08:43.611
Our last film is from
the very gifted Mark Taylor.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.520
Tim? Wake up! Tim!

08:49.595 --> 08:51.715
We'll be right back
after these messages from Binford!

09:04.544 --> 09:08.037
<i>Meet my family.
On the surface, we seem normal</i>

09:08.514 --> 09:11.245
<i>But things are not
always what they seem.</i>

09:29.369 --> 09:32.237
Brad, that's disgusting!

09:32.305 --> 09:35.241
Wait till you see
what I did with the spoon.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.547
<i>Hey, Mom. How was your day?</i>

09:47.653 --> 09:50.020
<i>You really want to know
how my day was?</i>

09:50.123 --> 09:51.489
<i>Not really.</i>

09:52.525 --> 09:53.549
Uh-oh.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.719
What?

09:54.794 --> 09:57.696
<i>Well, it was going great until I had this</i>

09:57.764 --> 10:01.701
<i>awful conference with this horribly
arrogant professor of mine.</i>

10:03.669 --> 10:05.908
Please don't mention his name!
Please don't mention his name!

10:05.938 --> 10:08.305
- You didn't, you didn't, you didn't.
<i>- Dr. Hanover.</i>

10:08.407 --> 10:09.636
You did!

10:12.245 --> 10:15.613
<i>He's a pompous jackass, you know?
He's smug, he's didactic.</i>

10:15.715 --> 10:18.742
<i>And what is the deal with men,
you know, and their comb-overs?</i>

10:18.818 --> 10:21.686
<i>I mean, this one would start
at his neck and stretch across.</i>

10:21.754 --> 10:24.019
<i>Hideous thing.</i>

10:27.326 --> 10:28.624
Good one.

10:32.498 --> 10:36.060
<i>And those are the Taylors.
If they are the typical American family,</i>

10:36.135 --> 10:37.501
<i>this country's in trouble.</i>

10:46.245 --> 10:50.114
I can't look. Check out Dr. Hanover.
See if he's angry.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.084
Don't make it obvious.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.447
He's not angry.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.323
- He's not?
- He's gone.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.135
Mom, are you ever gonna get off the
phone? I've gotta make some calls.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.497
- Use your phone.
- I can't.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.764
I'm downloading some hot pictures
from Denmark

11:12.438 --> 11:13.929
of Danishes.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.870
Brad, I've been trying to apologize
to Dr. Hanover for two hours. It's busy.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.504
I gotta keep trying.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.381
Hey, Mom! Did you ever get
a hold of your professor?

11:24.483 --> 11:27.612
No. And, you know, none of this
would've happened if you hadn't

11:27.687 --> 11:30.350
taped me without my knowledge.
Don't you know that's illegal?

11:30.423 --> 11:33.188
It would be,
except you said I could tape you.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.988
I have it on tape.

11:35.895 --> 11:39.457
I would never have approved of this
if I'd known that you were gonna be

11:39.532 --> 11:42.696
so irresponsible about
what you showed people!

11:42.768 --> 11:44.794
You're right.
I should have checked with you.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.339
I'm really sorry.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.044
Mom, you don't even know
if he saw Mark's video.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.378
He could've just left after Gregory's.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.014
Well, I can't take the chance of walking
into that thesis committee

11:52.044 --> 11:54.070
without knowing for sure.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.740
Oh, good! It's ringing.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.516
- Hello, Gregory?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:02.588 --> 12:04.853
Hi, this is Mrs. Taylor, Mark's mom.

12:05.691 --> 12:08.183
- Great film.
- Are you kidding?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.492
I was so traumatized by
the public viewing that

12:10.563 --> 12:14.193
I just spent two hours on the phone
with an Army recruiter.

12:15.234 --> 12:19.365
Interesting. Gregory, is your father
there? I need to talk to him.

12:19.438 --> 12:23.876
He's upstairs asleep. I think my film
sent him into a catatonic state.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.606
And I don't mean Arizona.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.581
Look, Gregory, did you and your father
stay and watch Mark's film?

12:29.715 --> 12:32.549
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- Oh, no.

12:32.618 --> 12:35.383
I feel so terrible.
I really wanted to apologize to him.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.754
Oh, for calling him a pompous jackass?

12:38.824 --> 12:41.851
Yeah. He was paged a couple of times
so I'm not sure if he saw that part.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.556
But I enjoyed it.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.362
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.769
Dr. Hanover isn't here yet anyway.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.136
Well, he's a very busy man.

12:54.206 --> 12:57.734
Maybe we should just whip through
my thesis without him.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.821
- What are you writing?
- Never mind.

13:08.888 --> 13:12.381
- Here's Dr. Hanover now.
- Hello, Jill.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.637
Well, speaking for the committee,
we feel that

13:21.667 --> 13:24.227
your thesis is basically quite solid.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.498
Oh, good.

13:25.571 --> 13:29.440
But we felt there were a few things
that were just a hair off.

13:36.549 --> 13:41.112
- A hair off?
- Dr. Miller, would you like to elaborate?

13:41.187 --> 13:42.280
Well, I...

13:42.355 --> 13:44.290
Was it the conclusion? Was it too thin?

13:46.993 --> 13:50.555
Sparse? I mean, shallow?

13:51.097 --> 13:54.226
I wasn't ready to talk about
the conclusion just yet.

13:54.300 --> 13:58.328
Oh, sorry, I jumped ahead...
I mean forward.

13:58.404 --> 14:02.569
On page 48, you say that feminism
has complicated the traditional

14:02.641 --> 14:05.702
psychological dynamic
between fathers and sons.

14:05.978 --> 14:07.276
Can you elaborate on that?

14:07.346 --> 14:11.283
Yes, I can. As I stated on page 49,

14:12.318 --> 14:16.085
"Fathers have to teach their sons
that women and men are equal,

14:16.155 --> 14:18.989
"even though they may not
have been raised with that belief."

14:19.058 --> 14:22.085
- Point well taken.
- Thank you, Dr. Comb-over... Hanover!

14:30.169 --> 14:32.331
Now, do you think you've
thoroughly addressed how

14:32.405 --> 14:35.500
the relationship has changed
between mothers and sons?

14:35.574 --> 14:36.803
Well, the thesis is called

14:36.909 --> 14:40.471
"The Father-Son Dynamic
in the Post-Feminist Era."

14:40.579 --> 14:43.549
I know what the thesis is called.
I came up with the title.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.481
- Wonderful title.
- Yeah.

14:45.551 --> 14:50.455
Now, is it possible that you've
treated the mother-son relationship

14:50.556 --> 14:54.049
- in a rather superficial way?
- Superficial?

14:55.361 --> 14:59.298
No. I think that I fully addressed that
in pages 38 to 47.

14:59.365 --> 15:03.735
Well, I thought it was more fully
addressed in the first draft.

15:03.803 --> 15:07.638
You shaved off a little bit too much.

15:07.706 --> 15:09.578
Jill, you've made some pretty
provocative statements.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.167
The question is, can you defend them?

15:11.243 --> 15:12.404
Well, I don't know. I...

15:12.545 --> 15:15.913
Well, if you don't know,
how are we supposed to know?

15:18.651 --> 15:22.418
- How did you like the typeface?
- Helvetica 12 point?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.190
- Excellent choice.
- I liked it.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.623
Yeah. That's good.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.864
Perfect. How was your day?

15:33.933 --> 15:37.062
Imagine having your head
squeezed in a vice.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.105
I don't have to imagine.

15:41.407 --> 15:44.969
- How was Dr. Hanover?
- Obviously, he saw Mark's film.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.248
He raked my thesis over the coals.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.247
Now I have to do
a whole rewrite by Friday.

15:48.347 --> 15:49.667
Honey, the man is a professional.

15:49.715 --> 15:53.743
I can't believe he'd let a few personal
remarks get in the way of his job.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.550
Well, if he wasn't attacking me
because of the insults,

15:56.622 --> 15:59.285
he was attacking me
because he hated my work.

15:59.358 --> 16:02.851
There you go now. Feel better?

16:05.731 --> 16:07.495
Here you go.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.833
Oh, thanks. You know, this part just
doesn't seem right there.

16:11.904 --> 16:15.238
"When the mother tries to instill
feminist ideology in her son,

16:15.307 --> 16:19.267
"and the father presents
a counter philosophy/ethos,

16:19.378 --> 16:22.405
"it can cause confusion
in the adolescent male."

16:25.785 --> 16:27.219
Sounds good to me.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.886
You understand that?

16:29.955 --> 16:32.049
No.
But I'm a confused adolescent male.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.057
Wilson?

16:41.167 --> 16:44.660
Come to me,
my lovely little creature of the night.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.931
- What? Are you drunk?
- No, no, no, no, Jill.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.343
I was talking to the Chiroptera
which I'm trying to attract with

16:53.412 --> 16:55.779
the sounds on this tape recorder.

16:55.881 --> 17:00.842
- What's that?
- It's a small device for recording tapes.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.823
- No. I mean the other thing.
- The Chiroptera. Well, that's a bat.

17:04.890 --> 17:08.917
I saw one swooping around here. I'm
trying to get her to nest in my eaves.

17:08.993 --> 17:12.521
I was just wondering
what you thought of my thesis.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.328
Oh, yes. The thesis, yes.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.368
Well, that was
a very interesting rewrite.

17:16.468 --> 17:20.303
I thought your use of comparative
symbolism had a certain

17:20.372 --> 17:23.865
- textural resonance that really...
- You think it blows.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.704
Like a Nor'easter.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.679
You know, to tell you the truth, Jill,
I actually preferred the original version.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.309
So did I.
But Dr. Hanover hated it, you know?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.985
And I have to make these changes
whether I believe in them or not.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.287
You know, your situation reminds me
<i>of Walking Naked.</i>

17:39.358 --> 17:42.123
- Good night, Wilson.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, Jill.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.425
<i>Walking Naked</i>
is a play I wrote in college.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.989
It's a saga of an Aztec warrior
who finds himself in New Jersey.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.369
Primitive man adapts
to modern society...

17:51.437 --> 17:55.602
No, no, no, no, no. It's about a guy who
loses his clothes in Newark.

17:55.674 --> 17:58.303
And funny stuff happens to him.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.580
So, now, wait. What does this
have to do with my thesis?

18:01.647 --> 18:05.140
Well, my drama department
wanted me to rewrite my play.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.144
But I was very passionate about
<i>Walking Naked.</i>

18:08.220 --> 18:09.592
So, you refused to make
any of the changes?

18:09.622 --> 18:13.457
No, no, no, no. Quite the opposite.
I caved in, rewrote the whole play.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.585
It was a big success.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.687
- You must've been thrilled!
- Uh-uh.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.894
No, I felt terrible because
I compromised the integrity of the play.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.698
So, you think that I should just
stick to what I wrote originally?

18:24.770 --> 18:28.104
You know, Jill, your name is
gonna be on that thesis forever.

18:28.173 --> 18:31.735
Shouldn't it represent something
that you truly believe in?

18:31.810 --> 18:34.575
Yes, it should.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.652
You've given me a lot to think about.
Thank you, Wilson.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.652
- You're always so sensible.
- Well, my pleasure.

18:39.718 --> 18:43.211
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have an old brown bat to seduce.

18:51.030 --> 18:54.330
- Dr. Hanover?
- Oh, Jill, come on in.

18:59.171 --> 19:04.007
- I've finished all my revisions.
- I look forward to reading it.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.475
Dr. Hanover, I've tried to incorporate
all of your notes.

19:08.547 --> 19:12.040
But, frankly, I just couldn't
make some of them work.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.746
- Pity.
- May I?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.982
Oh, please. Yes.

19:17.089 --> 19:21.151
Look, I don't mean to be disrespectful.

19:21.527 --> 19:25.487
I could only write this in a way
that makes sense to me.

19:25.564 --> 19:28.466
And I think you might have been
overly critical of my work.

19:28.534 --> 19:29.627
Why?

19:29.702 --> 19:33.195
Because you called me a pompous
jackass with a bad comb-over?

19:35.007 --> 19:37.499
- I am so, so sorry.
- Me, too.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.256
When my wife heard what you said,
she came after me with an Epilady.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.344
Yeah, I understand now
why you were so tough on my work.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.913
Jill, I wasn't tough on you because of
the personal remarks you made.

19:53.292 --> 19:56.785
- So, you really didn't like my thesis.
- No, no. I thought it was quite good.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.490
But during your oral exam,

19:58.564 --> 20:02.934
it's my job to challenge you,
and your job to defend your work.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.561
And I didn't exactly rise
to that challenge, did I?

20:05.637 --> 20:09.074
Well, I suspect your defense would
have been better if you weren't so

20:09.141 --> 20:11.076
flustered by the situation.

20:11.143 --> 20:15.911
Definitely. When you came in here with
your head shaved, I was completely...

20:15.981 --> 20:17.347
Wigged out?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.680
Good one!

20:23.755 --> 20:25.294
Just wait till you get out
in private practice

20:25.324 --> 20:28.089
and you have to deal with
what's inside people's heads.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.992
If I can't deal with
male pattern baldness,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.691
what am I gonna do when I get
people who think they're Elvis?

20:32.765 --> 20:37.328
I always make them a fried
peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.132
Jill, you're gonna be
a fine psychologist.

20:39.204 --> 20:43.266
And I'm sure, in time, you'll learn not
to be thrown by the unexpected.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.278
Thank you, Dr. Hanover.
And when you've read my revisions,

20:46.345 --> 20:48.712
I'll be ready to defend them.

20:48.814 --> 20:53.514
Jill, before you go, can I get your
professional opinion on something?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.349
Oh, certainly. Yes.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.493
What do you think of this?

21:03.562 --> 21:06.293
You can wear it, but can you defend it?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.569
Touché.

21:13.138 --> 21:16.836
Honey, that's great news. It really is.
I'll see you at home. Love you.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.810
Well, good news.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.847
Your dad, the pompous Dr. Hanover,

21:21.914 --> 21:25.282
- loved your mom's thesis.
- Really? Cool.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.148
Yeah, sure. It's cool for her.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.381
When's the last time
I ever got a compliment?

21:29.488 --> 21:32.515
People mock me day in and day out.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.686
They call me a mama's boy.
What kind of future do I have?

21:35.761 --> 21:38.788
I don't know.
How good do you look in flannel?

21:43.769 --> 21:47.137
Which one of you women
wants to arm-wrestle? Come on.

21:47.239 --> 21:51.199
I can take you. Excuse me. Hey there.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.688
Okay, I'll see you at home. I love you.

22:07.759 --> 22:10.923
Great news. Your dad, the...
