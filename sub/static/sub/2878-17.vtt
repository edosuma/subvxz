WEBVTT

00:03.181 --> 00:05.042
It was a nice
retirement party.

00:05.044 --> 00:06.228
I guess.

00:06.229 --> 00:07.264
Still, it's a shame

00:07.265 --> 00:10.166
Professor Rothman was forced
to step down.

00:10.168 --> 00:12.201
What choice did
the university have?

00:12.203 --> 00:13.335
He snapped.

00:13.337 --> 00:16.088
It happens to theoretical
physicists all the time.

00:16.090 --> 00:18.340
I wonder how long
Sheldon's got.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.294
These shrimp are
all the same size.

00:22.296 --> 00:24.930
There's no the logical order
to eat them in.

00:26.016 --> 00:30.186
Can't be very long.

00:30.188 --> 00:32.555
Hey, look, there's Rothman's
empty office.

00:32.557 --> 00:34.306
- Sad.
- Mm, indeed.

00:34.308 --> 00:35.524
Yeah.

00:35.526 --> 00:37.142
So sad.

00:37.144 --> 00:39.311
Dibs.

00:41.098 --> 00:43.782
What's up, fellas?

00:43.784 --> 00:45.784
What are you doing
here, Kripke?

00:45.786 --> 00:48.621
Ah, measuring my new office
for drapes.

00:48.623 --> 00:49.989
This is not your office.

00:49.991 --> 00:51.707
It hasn't been assigned yet.

00:51.709 --> 00:53.409
Well, I called dibs
at the Christmas party

00:53.411 --> 00:54.943
when Professor Rothman tried
to have intercourse

00:54.945 --> 00:56.629
with the Toys for Tots
collection box.

00:57.780 --> 00:58.914
Dibs?!

00:58.916 --> 01:00.916
This is a university,
not a playground.

01:00.918 --> 01:02.117
Offices are not assigned

01:02.119 --> 01:03.619
because someone called dibs.

01:03.621 --> 01:04.803
You just called dibs.

01:04.805 --> 01:06.338
Shut it.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.424
Offices are assigned
by seniority.

01:08.426 --> 01:10.726
I arrived
at the university first.

01:10.728 --> 01:13.562
I arrived at the office first.

01:13.564 --> 01:15.314
I'm the proverbial early bird.

01:15.316 --> 01:17.399
Gentlemen.

01:17.401 --> 01:19.401
Professor Rothman.

01:20.654 --> 01:22.855
Good evening.

01:27.694 --> 01:30.829
I'm glad
that men are wearing hats again.

01:31.698 --> 01:34.533

02:06.549 --> 02:08.216
I got you a little something.

02:08.217 --> 02:10.050
A little something?

02:10.053 --> 02:12.203
Oh, it...

02:14.223 --> 02:16.391
Oh, this is huge.

02:16.393 --> 02:18.459
What's huge is
what you've done for me.

02:18.461 --> 02:20.562
Oh, no, Amy,
I haven't done anything.

02:20.564 --> 02:23.297
No, no, before I met you,
I was a mousy wallflower.

02:23.299 --> 02:24.682
But look at me now.

02:24.684 --> 02:27.952
I'm like some kind of downtown
hipster party girl.

02:28.654 --> 02:30.021
With a posse, a boyfriend

02:30.023 --> 02:33.441
and a new lace bra that hooks
in the front, of all things.

02:33.443 --> 02:34.843
Open it.

02:34.845 --> 02:35.810
Open it.

02:35.812 --> 02:37.996
Okay.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.672 --> 02:49.174
I wanted to get you something
you didn't have.

02:49.176 --> 02:52.393
Wow!

02:52.395 --> 02:54.128
I... I don't know what to...

02:54.130 --> 02:56.214
Wow.

02:56.216 --> 02:57.665
Do you like it?

02:57.667 --> 03:00.018
Do I like it? Wow.

03:00.020 --> 03:02.837
So, uh, where are you
gonna hang it?

03:02.839 --> 03:04.939
Oh, my God.
Hang it. Wow.

03:04.941 --> 03:07.559
Um, you know,
I'd have to go get a hook

03:07.561 --> 03:09.343
and nails and a hammer and...

03:09.345 --> 03:10.862
No problem.
Oh, look.

03:10.864 --> 03:12.197
You got...

03:12.199 --> 03:15.683
You just... you got it all
right there. Wow.

03:20.823 --> 03:23.024
I found him.
He's in the bathroom.

03:23.026 --> 03:25.076
President Siebert?

03:25.078 --> 03:26.578
Can't this wait?

03:26.580 --> 03:28.379
I'm sorry.
We just need a word.

03:28.381 --> 03:32.550
Now? You realize I'm your boss,
and I am holding my penis?

03:32.552 --> 03:35.470
Sheldon, give the
man some privacy.

03:35.472 --> 03:38.640
I'm sorry. This guy's got
no respect for boundaries.

03:38.642 --> 03:40.842
What do you want?

03:40.844 --> 03:42.376
Will you tell
this lunatic

03:42.378 --> 03:44.062
that Professor Rothman's
office is rightfully mine?

03:44.064 --> 03:46.264
Can't you take this up
with your department chairman?

03:46.266 --> 03:49.067
We tried. His assistant said
he was on sabbatical.

03:49.069 --> 03:53.154
Although we distinctly heard
his office window open and shut.

03:53.156 --> 03:55.857
Gentlemen, there's a task I'm
trying to accomplish here,

03:55.859 --> 03:57.475
and I'm having
trouble doing it.

03:57.477 --> 04:01.395
Oh, my. President Siebert,
I don't mean to be an alarmist,

04:01.397 --> 04:04.465
but difficulty initiating a
urine stream could be a symptom

04:04.467 --> 04:06.467
of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

04:06.469 --> 04:08.036
If you're interested,

04:08.038 --> 04:10.605
I can send you a link
to a YouTube video

04:10.607 --> 04:12.941
that'll show you how
to perform your own rectal exam.

04:12.943 --> 04:17.411
Uh, helpful hint--
trim your nails first.

04:19.248 --> 04:21.349
Ignore him,
President Siebert.

04:21.351 --> 04:23.818
I'm sure a young man such as
yourself has a perfectly...

04:23.820 --> 04:25.553
healthy prostate.

04:25.555 --> 04:27.822
Oh, he's just trying
to butter you up.

04:27.824 --> 04:29.023
And for the record,

04:29.025 --> 04:32.293
butter is an excellent lubricant
for your rectal exam.

04:32.295 --> 04:35.296
Gentlemen, I'm going to allow
the two of you to work this out

04:35.298 --> 04:37.465
because A) you're both
brilliant scientists,

04:37.467 --> 04:39.033
and B) as far
as who gets

04:39.035 --> 04:41.402
Rothman's office,
I couldn't give the furry crack

04:41.404 --> 04:42.937
of a rat's behind.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.876
Well, as long
as we're here,

04:48.878 --> 04:51.112
I might as well
take a leak.

04:53.482 --> 04:55.450
Kripke?

04:55.452 --> 04:56.351
Yes?

04:56.353 --> 04:58.353
You're in my spot.

05:15.738 --> 05:17.905
That is big.

05:18.641 --> 05:20.475
<i>So</i> big.

05:20.477 --> 05:22.010
And ugly.

05:22.012 --> 05:23.578
So ugly.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.213
What am I gonna do?

05:25.215 --> 05:27.315
I don't know.

05:27.317 --> 05:29.250
You can't take it down.
You'll break her heart.

05:29.252 --> 05:31.519
Look at that face.

05:31.521 --> 05:34.155
That enormous, unsettling,

05:34.157 --> 05:36.691
crazy face.

05:38.661 --> 05:40.795
Is there any chance
I'll learn to love it?

05:40.797 --> 05:42.930
That depends.
Do you like pictures of yourself

05:42.932 --> 05:44.732
where you look like a man?

05:46.001 --> 05:48.870
All right, it's got to go.

05:48.872 --> 05:51.105
What will you tell Amy?

05:51.107 --> 05:52.340
How about I tell her

05:52.342 --> 05:53.908
the painting makes
you feel jealous

05:53.910 --> 05:55.309
because you're
not in it?

05:55.311 --> 05:58.746
Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?

06:00.649 --> 06:02.884
I already have a picture
of me and Howard's mom

06:02.886 --> 06:04.585
getting our hair cornrowed
in Venice Beach.

06:04.587 --> 06:06.554
I've suffered enough.

06:06.556 --> 06:08.890
Well, I guess I could
take it down and put it up

06:08.892 --> 06:10.658
when she comes over,
but it's kind of heavy.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.928
Oh, too bad you're not as strong
as the dude in the painting.

06:18.133 --> 06:19.434
Would you look
at this?

06:19.436 --> 06:21.736
I paid $25
to some kid on eBay

06:21.738 --> 06:24.605
for a handcrafted
Harry Potter wand.

06:24.607 --> 06:26.741
He sent me a stick.

06:28.911 --> 06:32.280
He went into his backyard,
he picked up a stick.

06:32.282 --> 06:34.816
It's numbered.

06:34.818 --> 06:36.851
Ooh, limited edition.

06:36.853 --> 06:38.386
Nice.

06:40.223 --> 06:41.522
Oh, that'll be Kripke.

06:41.524 --> 06:43.024
What's he doing here?

06:43.026 --> 06:45.777
We're going to work this office
situation out like gentlemen.

06:45.779 --> 06:48.830
And if that doesn't work,
I'm going to poison his tea.

06:49.915 --> 06:52.417
Cooper.
Kripke. Come in.

06:52.419 --> 06:54.252
I'm making tea.

06:54.254 --> 06:56.737
Would you like a cup?

06:56.739 --> 06:58.239
Am I wearing a
summer frock?

06:58.241 --> 07:00.074
No, I don't want tea.

07:01.076 --> 07:03.377
Let's get down
to brass tacks.

07:03.379 --> 07:07.165
Fine. In the interest
of preserving our friendship...

07:07.167 --> 07:08.249
We're not friends.

07:08.251 --> 07:09.767
Well, that's a little hard

07:09.769 --> 07:11.469
to hear, but all right.

07:12.805 --> 07:16.891
As you know, the essence
of diplomacy is compromise.

07:16.893 --> 07:18.309
With that in mind,

07:18.311 --> 07:19.593
I propose the following.

07:19.595 --> 07:22.263
I will take Rothman's office,

07:22.265 --> 07:26.601
and you will find a way
to be okay with that.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.455
How about
I take Rothman's office,

07:30.457 --> 07:32.824
and you go suck a lemon?

07:39.331 --> 07:42.100
You sure I can't get you
that cup of tea?

07:43.035 --> 07:44.218
How about
you decide this

07:44.220 --> 07:47.388
with Rock-Paper-Scissors
Lizard-Spock?

07:47.390 --> 07:50.007
What the frig is that?

07:50.009 --> 07:53.478
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
was created

07:53.480 --> 07:56.514
by Internet pioneer Sam Kass
as an improvement

07:56.516 --> 07:58.816
on the classic game
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

07:58.818 --> 07:59.984
All hail Sam Kass.

07:59.986 --> 08:01.986
Hail.

08:01.988 --> 08:04.438
How does it work?

08:04.440 --> 08:05.940
Oh, it's very simple.

08:05.942 --> 08:08.109
Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock,

08:08.111 --> 08:11.329
rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock,

08:11.331 --> 08:14.282
Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard,

08:14.284 --> 08:17.484
lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock,

08:17.486 --> 08:19.420
Spock vaporizes rock,

08:19.422 --> 08:21.956
and as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

08:26.762 --> 08:29.096
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

08:30.098 --> 08:31.265
Well, of course.

08:31.267 --> 08:32.666
Scissors cuts paper, paper

08:32.668 --> 08:33.851
covers rock, rock

08:33.852 --> 08:35.686
crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock,

08:35.688 --> 08:37.054
Spock smashes scissors,

08:37.056 --> 08:38.556
scissors
decapitates lizard,

08:38.558 --> 08:40.174
lizard eats paper, paper

08:40.176 --> 08:41.976
disproves Spock,
Spock vaporizes rock,

08:41.977 --> 08:45.847
and as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

08:47.549 --> 08:49.567
Almost got it.
One more time.

08:49.569 --> 08:51.736
Surely. Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock, rock...

08:51.738 --> 08:53.321
Sheldon, stop.

08:53.323 --> 08:54.572
He's screwing with you.

08:54.574 --> 08:56.707
Is he?

08:56.709 --> 08:58.242
Well, then,

08:58.244 --> 09:00.461
it seems
we have reached an impasse.

09:00.463 --> 09:03.581
I see no other option than
to challenge you to a duel.

09:03.583 --> 09:06.200
I'd smack you with a glove,
but just last week,

09:06.202 --> 09:08.302
I packed away my winter things.

09:09.321 --> 09:11.088
It's the 21st century.

09:11.090 --> 09:12.390
You can't
have a duel.

09:12.392 --> 09:15.059
H-Hang on, Howard.

09:16.595 --> 09:19.880
Barry, how good
of a shot are you?

09:20.899 --> 09:22.733
Not pistols. Minds.

09:22.735 --> 09:24.352
A trivia contest,

09:24.354 --> 09:26.020
and you may choose
the field of battle.

09:26.022 --> 09:29.523
<i>Star Trek</i> trivia, <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>Next Generation</i> trivia,

09:29.525 --> 09:30.875
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i>
trivia,

09:30.877 --> 09:33.160
<i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>Voyager</i> trivia,

09:33.162 --> 09:35.580
or model trains.

09:35.582 --> 09:38.499
You have a complete
advantage in trivia.

09:38.501 --> 09:39.900
You have an eidetic memory.

09:39.902 --> 09:41.369
Plus, I haven't watched
<i>Star Trek</i>

09:41.371 --> 09:43.588
since I discovered
the strip club near my apartment

09:43.590 --> 09:46.374
has a free buffet.

09:46.376 --> 09:47.708
It's gonna be hard

09:47.710 --> 09:50.177
to find something
you're both equally good at.

09:50.179 --> 09:52.346
Is there anything
you're both equally bad at?

09:52.348 --> 09:54.548
Sports.

10:02.751 --> 10:04.251
All right,
this is one-on-one.

10:04.253 --> 10:07.088
First person to five
wins the office. Any questions?

10:07.090 --> 10:07.855
Yes, Sheldon.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.841
Five what?

10:09.843 --> 10:13.027
Balls in the basket.

10:16.065 --> 10:17.315
Ew!

10:29.111 --> 10:32.297
It's out, right?

10:40.055 --> 10:41.806
Time.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.725
Ran out of room.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.513
You know all those
terrible things

10:48.515 --> 10:49.764
bullies used
to do to us?

10:49.766 --> 10:50.815
Yeah.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.817
I get it.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.891
Ooh, aah!

11:02.528 --> 11:04.963
Hey!

11:05.664 --> 11:07.432
He did that on purpose!

11:07.434 --> 11:08.833
No, he didn't.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.337
Nothing that's happening here
is being done on purpose.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.206
Okay, uh, forget one-on-one.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.774
Let's try
a free throw contest.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.844
First person who makes a basket
wins the office.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.746
Making it too easy there,
Hofstadter.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.415
No. No, I'm not.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.987
Use the force, Sheldon.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.889
Use the force.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.728
I'm gonna need more force.

11:38.630 --> 11:42.400
All right, Cooper, prepare
to have your heart broken.

11:46.322 --> 11:48.522
Do I get points for that?

12:00.135 --> 12:01.252
Oh!

12:08.178 --> 12:11.345
All right,
we gave it 45 minutes.

12:11.347 --> 12:13.648
It's no longer funny.
Let's try something else.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.434
What do you propose?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.019
Uh, on the count of three,

12:18.021 --> 12:20.405
both of you bounce the balls
as hard as you can.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.823
The highest bounce
wins the office.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.825
Oh, you are going down, Cooper.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.193
I don't think so, Kripke.

12:25.195 --> 12:27.578
I've bounced many a rubber ball
in my day.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.947
All right,
that's enough trash talk.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.834
One,

12:32.836 --> 12:35.002
two, three.

12:36.738 --> 12:38.539
Sheldon
was higher.

12:38.541 --> 12:39.757
Congratulations,

12:39.759 --> 12:40.958
Sheldon. You win office.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.578
Who's unsatisfactory
in P.E. now?

12:47.716 --> 12:49.500
♪ We go together

12:49.502 --> 12:52.220
♪ Like rama lama lama
ka dinga da dinga dong ♪

12:52.222 --> 12:53.438
♪ Remembered forever...

12:53.440 --> 12:55.156
Oh, what a great movie.

12:55.158 --> 12:57.475
I cannot believe
you've never seen <i>Grease.</i>

12:57.477 --> 12:59.277
My mother didn't allow me
to watch it.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.779
She was afraid it might
encourage me to join a gang.

13:04.099 --> 13:05.450
I've got to go.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.784
I've got to get up early.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.436
My company's testing
a new steroid

13:08.438 --> 13:10.271
that supposedly
doesn't shrink testicles,

13:10.273 --> 13:13.908
and the last one there
has to do e measuring.

13:13.910 --> 13:16.077
I guess I should get going, too.

13:17.612 --> 13:20.164
Good night, painting Penny.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.216
Good night, real Penny.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.585
Good night, real Amy.

13:24.587 --> 13:27.889
You don't have to say
good night to painting Amy,

13:27.891 --> 13:29.874
'cause she's never leaving.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.345
Good night, real Penny.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.147
Bye.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.065
Good night, transvestite Penny.

13:42.105 --> 13:44.355
Okay. Let us take you
off the wall.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.360
Out of sight, out of mind.

13:50.812 --> 13:52.980
I wish.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.368
You know, can I
borrow that movie?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.670
Those singing hooligans
really got my motor running.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.873
Sure, sure. Enjoy.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.208
I mean, get it back
to me when you can, or...

14:04.210 --> 14:05.593
you know what, actually,
you keep it.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.011
It's just going to be
my gift to you.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.713
- Bye.
- Thank you.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.664
Wait...
Where'd the painting go?

14:10.666 --> 14:12.216
It's right over there.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.603
Why?

14:16.271 --> 14:18.472
I have no idea.
That is weird.

14:21.176 --> 14:22.610
- You hate it.
- No.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.730
No, no.
It's just, it's a little big.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.949
- I feel like an idiot.
- No, come on, you're not an idiot.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.300
Look, just help me
put it back up.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.352
Why? So you can just
take it down when I leave?

14:31.354 --> 14:33.704
I don't need your pity.
Oh, Amy, come on...

14:33.706 --> 14:37.241
I'm just glad I didn't
go for the sculpture.

14:40.078 --> 14:43.614
Ah, the spoils.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.416
I see why victors love them.

14:47.319 --> 14:48.753
I'm happy for you, Sheldon.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.455
But I have to admit I'm going to
miss sharing an office with you.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.924
Oh, of course you are.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.159
Feel free to drop
by any time.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.228
Thank you.
Yeah. Call first.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.136
Oh. Hello.

15:07.439 --> 15:08.406
Professor Rothman.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.208
This isn't your
office anymore.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.609
You're retired.

15:11.611 --> 15:17.381
I think the word you're
looking for is... "invisible."

15:20.953 --> 15:23.487
I came to say I'm sorry.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.289
Don't bother.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.258
Oh, Amy, please.
I'm so humiliated.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.493
I sat there the whole time
that we were watching "Grease,"

15:29.495 --> 15:31.963
thinking you liked the painting.
I know.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.998
I was a fool from "Summer
Lovin'" to the very last

15:34.000 --> 15:35.967
"rama lama lama ke ding
a de dinga a dong."

15:37.836 --> 15:39.337
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.871
I should have
been honest with you

15:40.873 --> 15:42.740
and told you
the gift was too much.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.842
Yes, too much.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.844
Because our friendship
is fundamentally asymmetrical.

15:46.846 --> 15:50.014
I clearly like you
more than you like me.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.782
I don't think you can
put a number on

15:51.784 --> 15:53.384
how much one person
likes another.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.320
I bought you a painting
that's 12 square feet in area.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.388
There's a number.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.457
Amy, come on...

15:59.459 --> 16:01.092
If you don't like feet,
you can try dollars.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.660
The painting set me back
three grand.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.930
Three gr... Oh, my God!

16:06.732 --> 16:08.266
Look, look, Amy,

16:08.268 --> 16:10.968
all you need to know is,
you are my friend

16:10.970 --> 16:13.371
and I don't want to
lose you out of my life.

16:13.373 --> 16:17.008
I'm sorry, I'm just having
trouble believing you right now.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.078
Grab your hammer.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.547
No. Damage is done.

16:23.549 --> 16:28.419
Okay, look, I didn't want to say
this, but the real reason

16:28.421 --> 16:30.855
I took the painting down was...

16:30.857 --> 16:34.659
because it made
Bernadette very jealous.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.861
Oh, my goodness,

16:36.863 --> 16:39.030
how could I have not seen that?

16:39.032 --> 16:40.164
The painting is

16:40.166 --> 16:42.366
a constant reminder
that of the three of us,

16:42.368 --> 16:44.902
she is the least cool.

16:44.904 --> 16:49.073
Yeah, that's...
that's what it is, so...

16:49.075 --> 16:50.508
You have such a good heart.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.210
Yeah... I try.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.046
Come on.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.547
Whoa, whoa, where are we going?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.182
We're going to go put
this painting back up

16:58.184 --> 16:59.684
in your apartment.
Well, what about Bernadette?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.420
Oh, screw her. She's just lucky
we let her hang out with us.

17:25.644 --> 17:26.844
What are you doing?

17:26.846 --> 17:29.313
I'm trying to raise
the temperature in here

17:29.315 --> 17:31.582
before my nipples tear
through my shirt.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.619
Why don't you just
turn up the thermostat?

17:35.621 --> 17:37.154
Aha! Good question.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.690
It turns out the thermostat
for my new office

17:39.692 --> 17:42.360
isn't in my new office.
No. It's next door,

17:42.362 --> 17:44.228
in Professor Davenport's office,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.963
who is currently
enjoying the hot flashes

17:45.965 --> 17:47.798
associated with menopause.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.835
Why is there a hole here?

17:50.837 --> 17:52.837
Why is there a hole
in my new office?

17:52.839 --> 17:55.139
I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities:

17:55.141 --> 17:56.907
"There was something in the wall

17:56.909 --> 17:59.377
that someone outside
the wall wanted,"

17:59.379 --> 18:00.611
or the more disturbing,

18:00.613 --> 18:03.881
"there was something
in the wall that wanted out."

18:05.283 --> 18:07.685
Well, at least you
finally got a window that opens.

18:07.687 --> 18:08.619
That's nice.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.988
Is it? Listen.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.257
What, you don't like
wind chimes?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.493
No, I hate them,
but it gets worse.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.365
- There it is.
- The bird?

18:21.367 --> 18:24.101
It's completely out of tune
with the wind chimes.

18:25.003 --> 18:25.970
So?

18:25.972 --> 18:27.204
You don't get it, do you?

18:27.206 --> 18:28.672
That's a mockingbird.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.741
Mockingbirds can
change their song,

18:30.743 --> 18:32.643
which means he's
out of tune on purpose.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.679
He's mocking me.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.083
Oh dear. There it is again.
Do you feel it?

18:39.085 --> 18:43.154
The growing realization that
you are one wacky bastard? Yep.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.489
No. The vibration.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.491
We are directly underneath
the geology lab,

18:47.493 --> 18:50.094
and they're running their
confounded sieve shakers again.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.395
Hey, gravel monkeys,

18:51.397 --> 18:54.698
if you need to shake rocks,
try jiggling your heads around!

18:54.700 --> 18:57.001
Sheldon, relax.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.068
How can I relax?

18:58.070 --> 18:59.937
My nervous system is
being stretched out

18:59.939 --> 19:03.207
like the strings of a harp
and plucked by holes and birds

19:03.209 --> 19:05.776
and wind and the
low-hanging scrotum

19:05.778 --> 19:07.545
of the difficult-to-evict
Professor Rothman.

19:10.115 --> 19:11.282
If you're not happy,

19:11.284 --> 19:12.917
why don't you just let
Kripke have the office?

19:12.919 --> 19:14.285
Wait, and let him win?

19:14.287 --> 19:16.287
Do I look crazy to you?

19:16.289 --> 19:17.655
We're trying to think down here,

19:17.657 --> 19:20.307
you geode-loving
feldspar jockeys!

19:20.309 --> 19:21.942
And you...

19:21.944 --> 19:24.495
the notes are
C, D, E, G and A.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.264
You pick one or I am
chopping down that tree!

19:37.671 --> 19:39.182
How's that?

19:39.183 --> 19:41.967
Little higher on the right.

19:41.969 --> 19:43.886
- Now?
- Little more.

19:43.888 --> 19:45.971
No. That's got it.

19:47.891 --> 19:50.476
Yeah, okay.
That's, uh, that's good.

19:51.394 --> 19:52.834
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.980
Mm.

19:53.981 --> 19:56.866
Originally
we were painted nude.

20:02.806 --> 20:05.774
But I had him add clothes,
'cause I thought

20:05.776 --> 20:08.961
it was an unnecessary challenge
to our heterosexuality.

20:11.248 --> 20:13.716
Yeah, good call.

20:13.718 --> 20:16.001
But if you ever change
your mind, all it would take

20:16.003 --> 20:19.054
is some warm, soapy water
and a couple of sponges.

20:20.073 --> 20:21.376
You're talking about
the painting, right?

20:21.401 --> 20:22.601
Sure.

20:28.231 --> 20:30.933
Help! Somebody help!

20:34.404 --> 20:35.754
What happened?

20:35.756 --> 20:39.508
I was trying to see what was
in here and my head got stuck.

20:39.510 --> 20:41.643
Why would you do that?

20:41.645 --> 20:44.446
It's called
scientific curiosity!

20:45.699 --> 20:47.733
Now go get butter.

20:47.735 --> 20:49.151
Hang in there.

20:49.153 --> 20:50.953
I'll be right back.
