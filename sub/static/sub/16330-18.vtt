00:07.906 --> 00:09.873
- Shut up!
- Amber!

00:12.179 --> 00:14.043
- Stay away from me, Eli!
- Amber, stop!

00:14.045 --> 00:15.345
- Listen to me!
- You're one of them!

00:15.347 --> 00:17.113
No, I'm not! I'm trying to help you!

00:17.115 --> 00:19.086
Hey, stop it! Stop it, both of you!

00:19.111 --> 00:21.987
You're upsetting the others.
Amber, go to your room.

00:22.617 --> 00:25.885
Hey, no! You stay away
from her, you hear me?

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.218 --> 00:39.179
Hi, it's me. It's happening again.

00:39.204 --> 00:40.693
What should I do?

00:40.695 --> 00:42.899
No, it's worse this time.

00:47.468 --> 00:49.626
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:49.651 --> 00:51.008
Amber!

00:52.875 --> 00:55.165
Eli, what happened?!

01:00.251 --> 01:01.564
You ready to go to work?

01:01.589 --> 01:03.329
Is that what we're calling it?

01:04.328 --> 01:07.006
I don't have a job at
the FBI like you do.

01:07.258 --> 01:10.883
I have... babysitters.

01:11.679 --> 01:14.304
Would you give us a second? Thank you.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.961
If you want to stay
here, you have to come in

01:16.986 --> 01:18.250
and see Dr. Sun every morning.

01:18.275 --> 01:19.424
That's part of the deal.

01:19.426 --> 01:20.508
And then I get to hang out

01:20.516 --> 01:21.782
with those guys the rest of the day?

01:21.784 --> 01:23.784
Freedom is something you have to earn.

01:23.786 --> 01:25.419
This is just a small step

01:25.421 --> 01:27.521
before you get to start
your normal life again.

01:28.741 --> 01:30.359
Again?

01:30.517 --> 01:32.544
I was trained as a child soldier,

01:32.569 --> 01:34.050
raised by a psychopath,

01:34.075 --> 01:36.442
and then I had my memory erased.

01:36.467 --> 01:38.851
When did I have a normal life?

01:38.876 --> 01:40.462
Fair point.

01:42.220 --> 01:43.698
Look, we gotta go, okay?

01:43.723 --> 01:45.306
Today, of all days, I can't be late.

01:45.331 --> 01:46.868
- Sure.
- Right.

01:51.196 --> 01:53.297
We're the only ones trying to stop them.

01:53.299 --> 01:54.657
The DOJ seriously thinks

01:54.682 --> 01:56.493
we aided and abetted Sandstorm?

01:56.518 --> 01:59.704
Of course not. They're just using
that as a ticket to depose us.

01:59.706 --> 02:01.305
It's a fishing expedition.

02:01.307 --> 02:03.274
They're just looking for a
scapegoat for the Sandstorm raid.

02:03.276 --> 02:04.709
If this team gets paraded

02:04.711 --> 02:06.242
in front of a Senate subcommittee,

02:06.267 --> 02:08.880
win or lose, that's enough
to disband this task force

02:08.882 --> 02:10.477
and end all of our careers.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.733
- That is not gonna happen.
- How can you be so sure?

02:12.758 --> 02:15.191
Sandstorm is connected
to me. It's my family.

02:15.216 --> 02:17.149
That's not gonna look
so good to outsiders.

02:17.174 --> 02:18.934
Especially when the outsider...

02:18.959 --> 02:20.842
running the depositions
is Matthew Weitz.

02:20.844 --> 02:22.277
Yeah, he's trying to
make a name for himself,

02:22.279 --> 02:23.612
trying to further his career.

02:23.614 --> 02:24.949
I didn't get subpoenaed.

02:24.974 --> 02:27.010
Maybe I could speak to
my friends at the DOJ,

02:27.035 --> 02:28.465
see if they could delay the depositions.

02:28.490 --> 02:30.085
No, don't do that.

02:30.087 --> 02:31.853
That'll make Weitz come after us harder.

02:31.855 --> 02:34.660
Just focus on tracking the
bank account that Roman gave us.

02:34.685 --> 02:37.261
If we find Sandstorm's money,
then we change the game.

02:37.286 --> 02:39.503
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.600
So, what's the play on Weitz?

02:44.602 --> 02:47.625
The raid was a big loss but
we've got nothing to hide,

02:47.650 --> 02:49.150
so we fight him with the truth.

02:50.231 --> 02:51.285
_

02:51.597 --> 02:53.047
I just got a hit on another tattoo.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.638
Should we wait until
after the depositions?

02:54.640 --> 02:56.948
No, nothing changes.

02:56.973 --> 02:59.370
We've got a job to do,
so let's go and do it.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.292
- Hey.
- Yeah?

03:03.317 --> 03:04.979
You heard from Reade?

03:05.042 --> 03:08.185
No. He won't return my calls.

03:08.390 --> 03:11.378
Since he quit, I guess
he doesn't have to.

03:31.810 --> 03:34.274
Yeah, that's been ringing all morning.

03:36.047 --> 03:38.436
Oof! You look pretty roughed up.

03:38.461 --> 03:40.688
You get hit by a truck or something?

03:41.247 --> 03:43.766
It doesn't matter. I'm
just happy you're awake.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.274
I'm tired of talking to myself.

03:47.235 --> 03:49.866
My name's Travis. What's your name?

03:49.891 --> 03:51.859
Just mind your own business.

03:51.884 --> 03:53.211
Well...

03:54.463 --> 03:56.114
okay.

03:57.781 --> 03:59.899
A while back, I decoded
a string of numbers

03:59.924 --> 04:02.368
embedded in Jane's hourglass tattoo.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.471
They match a corporate
ID for a 501-C non-profit

04:05.473 --> 04:07.473
called Life Prospect Inc.

04:07.475 --> 04:09.108
Is that some kind of charity foundation?

04:09.110 --> 04:10.242
Yeah, but they barely exist.

04:10.244 --> 04:13.015
The address and phone number
associated with it are defunct

04:13.040 --> 04:15.577
and the money funneled
into the foundation

04:15.602 --> 04:18.918
is obscured by layers upon
layers of shell companies.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.620
There was nothing to
investigate until now.

04:21.954 --> 04:24.548
This is 16-year-old Amber Wallace,

04:24.573 --> 04:26.606
found dead at her
foster home this morning.

04:26.608 --> 04:28.533
What does she have to
do with the non-profit?

04:28.558 --> 04:30.243
Life Prospect bankrolls

04:30.245 --> 04:32.263
the private foster home she lived in.

04:32.490 --> 04:35.201
Wait. So you think my tattoo
is connected to her death?

04:35.226 --> 04:37.383
Sandstorm put this
non-profit on your body

04:37.385 --> 04:38.748
and now a young girl is dead.

04:38.772 --> 04:40.538
It's certainly worth looking into.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.040
What else do we know?

04:42.042 --> 04:43.853
Not much. Police arrived at the scene,

04:43.878 --> 04:45.878
but I've been checking
Amber's social media.

04:45.879 --> 04:48.313
Her posts have grown
increasingly more erratic

04:48.338 --> 04:49.998
over the past week.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.056
"I'd run but the devil
is always watching.

04:52.081 --> 04:54.982
"There is no escape. I
know he's coming for me."

04:55.258 --> 04:57.539
Let's go and take a
look at that crime scene.

05:01.891 --> 05:05.245
Oh, there's the smiling
faces I came to see.

05:05.270 --> 05:06.696
It's very lovely to see you again.

05:06.721 --> 05:08.500
Wish we could say the same.

05:09.180 --> 05:10.673
I'm gonna set up in the conference room.

05:10.675 --> 05:12.375
Get ready for depositions in ten.

05:12.377 --> 05:15.015
Where is our tattooed friend?

05:15.040 --> 05:16.938
I'm looking forward to
speaking with her today.

05:16.963 --> 05:18.938
Jane is heading out on
a case and so are we.

05:18.963 --> 05:20.910
Oh, you guys have a case.

05:20.912 --> 05:23.246
That's so crazy. I also have a case.

05:23.248 --> 05:25.652
Everybody has to speak with me today

05:25.677 --> 05:27.301
or face immediate suspension.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.113
It's your call.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.283
We'll answer any questions that you have

05:31.308 --> 05:33.182
regarding the raid on
the Sandstorm compound,

05:33.184 --> 05:34.984
but it's gonna have to
wait until we get back.

05:34.986 --> 05:38.191
I can't have you interfering
with us doing our job.

05:41.181 --> 05:42.881
That's fine.

05:42.906 --> 05:45.898
I'll interview Special
Agent Patterson first.

05:45.984 --> 05:48.351
You don't normally take the
lab rat in the field, do you?

05:48.353 --> 05:50.250
I'll send her down.

06:06.259 --> 06:08.750
Tasha, see if they found
anything on her body.

06:08.775 --> 06:10.608
- You with the FBI?
- Yeah.

06:10.610 --> 06:12.634
You're gonna want to see this.

06:23.454 --> 06:24.602
So, where is everyone?

06:24.627 --> 06:26.579
We got a frantic call from a young boy.

06:26.604 --> 06:28.604
Arrived five minutes
later to an empty house.

06:28.606 --> 06:31.342
All six kids missing, no
sign of the foster mom.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.634
- Did you try calling her?
- Tried, but her phone's off.

06:33.636 --> 06:34.929
We're running a trace on it now.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.361
How do six kids and their foster mom

06:36.363 --> 06:37.561
just vanish like ghosts?

06:37.586 --> 06:39.397
Amber said the devil was after her

06:39.422 --> 06:40.755
and now they're gone.

06:40.757 --> 06:42.717
Maybe he was after all of them.

06:42.811 --> 06:44.960
Or maybe he's already found them.

06:51.678 --> 06:55.976
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

07:02.092 --> 07:03.906
It looks like she's holding her own.

07:03.931 --> 07:06.138
Well, she's handled worse
forms of questioning.

07:07.811 --> 07:09.840
I talked to social services.

07:09.865 --> 07:11.546
No one has any idea
where those missing kids

07:11.548 --> 07:12.810
or their foster mom are,

07:12.835 --> 07:14.149
but I put out missing persons alerts

07:14.151 --> 07:15.420
and got one hit.

07:15.445 --> 07:17.619
17-year old Eli Bello was caught on tape

07:17.621 --> 07:20.021
trying to steal a cell
from a bodega in Yonkers.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.623
When the clerk caught him,

07:21.625 --> 07:23.592
Eli dropped the phone and ran off.

07:23.594 --> 07:26.397
That's a long way from home.
What's he doing up in Yonkers?

07:26.422 --> 07:28.108
He could be running
with the rest of the kids

07:28.133 --> 07:30.066
or he could be the one chasing them.

07:30.068 --> 07:31.701
Does he have a motive to kill the girl?

07:31.703 --> 07:33.236
To throw her out the window?

07:33.696 --> 07:35.827
They looked like good friends to me.

07:35.852 --> 07:37.812
Maybe something changed.

07:37.837 --> 07:39.618
What's the medical examiner saying?

07:39.643 --> 07:41.054
They're backed up as usual.

07:41.079 --> 07:43.134
Wait, what about the charity foundation?

07:43.159 --> 07:45.406
- Any idea who's behind it?
- Not yet.

07:45.430 --> 07:47.414
The techs are looking at
evidence at the foster home now,

07:47.439 --> 07:48.962
trying to trace the
foundation's purchases

07:48.987 --> 07:50.226
to a permanent address.

07:50.251 --> 07:51.683
We need to find Eli.

07:51.685 --> 07:53.052
Maybe he can tell us
what's really going on here.

07:53.077 --> 07:55.855
I'll loop in Patterson as
soon as she's done with Weitz.

07:57.949 --> 08:00.605
I'd like to move on
to your personal life,

08:00.630 --> 08:02.611
Special Agent Patterson.

08:02.636 --> 08:04.957
Would it be fair to
characterize you as...

08:04.982 --> 08:06.941
unlucky in love?

08:07.097 --> 08:08.803
I suppose so.

08:08.805 --> 08:10.238
You suppose so?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.739
There was a Sandstorm mole

08:11.741 --> 08:13.612
working in your team's
midst for over a year.

08:13.637 --> 08:15.565
You had a romantic relationship with him

08:15.590 --> 08:18.023
and you had no idea he was a terrorist.

08:18.025 --> 08:19.597
Yeah, Borden may have...

08:19.622 --> 08:21.060
Nigel Thornton.

08:21.062 --> 08:22.635
Let's use his actual
name for the record.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.895
Nigel Thornton may have fooled us,

08:25.897 --> 08:28.231
but it was because of
my relationship with him

08:28.256 --> 08:29.775
that I was able to discover the truth.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.835
And where did that truth get you?

08:30.860 --> 08:32.163
It certainly didn't prevent the tragedy

08:32.188 --> 08:34.684
that occurred during the
Sandstorm compound raid.

08:34.710 --> 08:36.249
Did the discovery of Nigel's identity

08:36.274 --> 08:39.065
lead to any apprehension
of Sandstorm operatives?

08:39.067 --> 08:41.333
Did it lead to any Intel
regarding the whereabouts

08:41.336 --> 08:44.070
of Sandstorm's leader or anyone?

08:44.072 --> 08:46.514
- Not yet.
- Why is that?

08:48.046 --> 08:49.675
Well, he's dead,

08:49.700 --> 08:51.397
but we're still using
what we know about him

08:51.422 --> 08:53.171
in conjunction with other leads.

08:53.196 --> 08:54.915
Let's talk about those other leads.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.351
It says here that you assisted Sandstorm

08:57.376 --> 08:59.132
in the theft of a microchip.

08:59.157 --> 09:01.322
- Is that correct?
- I didn't assist Sandstorm.

09:01.324 --> 09:03.150
They were gonna get that
chip one way or another.

09:03.189 --> 09:05.456
Our involvement allowed
us to get a peek at it.

09:05.481 --> 09:08.157
- How come just a peek?
- The data upload was compromised.

09:08.159 --> 09:09.894
Compromised by Jane Doe.

09:09.896 --> 09:11.929
It says here that she
aborted the mission

09:11.931 --> 09:14.732
to save her brother, another terrorist.

09:14.734 --> 09:17.625
How many criminals need to undermine you

09:17.650 --> 09:20.174
before you realize that
there is something rotten

09:20.199 --> 09:22.072
inside your team?

09:24.400 --> 09:26.985
I want to bring Roman in
on this missing kids case.

09:27.010 --> 09:29.142
Jane, he's not an FBI agent.

09:29.158 --> 09:30.798
Well, technically, I'm not, either.

09:30.823 --> 09:33.360
I cleared Roman to assist
us with Sandstorm cases,

09:33.362 --> 09:34.822
not tattoo cases.

09:34.847 --> 09:36.163
He feels trapped.

09:36.165 --> 09:38.175
He's out of his cell
but he's still isolated.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.500
This could give him purpose.

09:39.502 --> 09:41.135
Or it could overwhelm him.

09:41.296 --> 09:43.763
He needs to become acclimated
to his new situation.

09:43.788 --> 09:44.938
I think he's ready.

09:44.940 --> 09:47.207
Even if he is, Weitz is out for blood.

09:47.209 --> 09:48.842
Now, today is not a good day

09:48.844 --> 09:50.744
to get Roman to assist
us with this case.

09:50.746 --> 09:52.966
Roman was raised at an orphanage.

09:52.991 --> 09:55.592
He could have useful insights.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.394
I think Jane is right.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.662
Roman had an underlying
loyalty for Shepherd.

09:59.687 --> 10:03.113
If he feels rudderless now,
we could risk a backslide.

10:03.138 --> 10:06.136
Look, this is a chance for us
to show the good that we do,

10:06.138 --> 10:08.771
that his loyalty is in
the right place with us.

10:13.228 --> 10:14.381
All right.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.795
When Roman finishes his
session with Dr. Sun,

10:16.820 --> 10:17.964
we can bring him in,

10:17.966 --> 10:20.400
but we have to keep him
out of Weitz's crosshairs.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.746
- Okay.
- All right.

10:22.771 --> 10:24.724
Sir, I still need your
insurance information.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.802
- I'm not going through my plan.
- Are you sure?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.513
I've said it five
times already! I'm sure!

10:29.959 --> 10:32.318
This place will get its money, okay?

10:38.076 --> 10:41.193
Hey, how long you had it?

10:41.647 --> 10:43.427
PTSD?

10:43.857 --> 10:45.962
Come on, that little outburst there,

10:45.987 --> 10:48.959
shouting in your sleep, leg tremors.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.771
I know the signs.

10:50.796 --> 10:53.904
Same stuff was happening to
me when I came back from Iraq.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.963
- You a vet too?
- No.

10:56.965 --> 10:59.699
Bad divorce or something?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.053
I'm FBI,

11:02.078 --> 11:04.419
and I don't have PTSD.

11:07.197 --> 11:08.755
Okay.

11:11.076 --> 11:12.216
I don't understand.

11:12.241 --> 11:14.513
Does this tattoo have something
to do with me or Shepherd?

11:14.538 --> 11:16.771
Probably not, but it's
a chance to show everyone

11:16.773 --> 11:18.239
you can be a trusted
member of this team.

11:18.241 --> 11:19.908
Oh, so they don't
throw me back in a cage

11:19.910 --> 11:20.975
when this is all over?

11:20.977 --> 11:22.177
Look, it's a big opportunity.

11:22.179 --> 11:23.510
It's important.

11:27.526 --> 11:28.666
How'd it go with Weitz?

11:28.682 --> 11:30.449
He's not just here
about the Sandstorm raid.

11:30.451 --> 11:32.845
He's asking about other
ops, twisting the facts,

11:32.870 --> 11:34.303
trying to make us look reckless.

11:34.305 --> 11:35.738
That won't change a thing, all right?

11:35.740 --> 11:37.206
All of us, we just
keep telling the truth.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.341
- What if that's not enough?
- That's all we've got.

11:39.343 --> 11:40.675
How are we on this case?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.488
Still no sign of the
kids or their foster mom,

11:42.513 --> 11:44.413
but we traced the purchases

11:44.415 --> 11:46.038
made by the foundation for the home.

11:46.063 --> 11:47.863
The transactions were all
linked to a credit card

11:47.865 --> 11:49.531
with a Brooklyn address,

11:49.533 --> 11:52.259
a warehouse destroyed
in a fire ten months ago.

11:52.284 --> 11:54.007
What about Eli Bello?

11:54.032 --> 11:56.520
This is Don Licata, Eli's music teacher.

11:56.522 --> 11:59.156
He lives two blocks away from
the bodega that Eli robbed.

11:59.158 --> 12:00.791
So maybe Eli was up in Yonkers,

12:00.793 --> 12:02.536
trying to reach out
to somebody he knows.

12:02.561 --> 12:05.028
We can't get ahold of Licata,
but he works from home.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.829
Well, I guess we're going to Yonkers.

12:06.854 --> 12:08.387
I want to go to the city morgue,

12:08.389 --> 12:10.210
try to expedite Amber's autopsy.

12:10.235 --> 12:11.718
- Okay.
- I'm gonna have to sit this one out.

12:11.743 --> 12:13.592
I'm next up in Weitz's batting order.

12:13.594 --> 12:15.436
Maybe we can take Roman.

12:18.468 --> 12:20.789
If we do take you out,

12:20.814 --> 12:22.554
your guards have to come.

12:23.124 --> 12:24.570
I understand.

12:24.572 --> 12:26.839
And you will be limited in
what you're allowed to do.

12:26.864 --> 12:28.141
Whatever you need.

12:28.166 --> 12:30.208
All right. Let's move.

12:32.244 --> 12:34.213
It is always great chatting with you,

12:34.238 --> 12:35.410
Special Agent Zapata,

12:35.435 --> 12:36.967
but where is your partner?

12:36.969 --> 12:38.569
No one can seem to
find Special Agent Reade

12:38.571 --> 12:39.994
and serve him his subpoena.

12:40.019 --> 12:42.148
- I don't know.
- Any reason he'd be avoiding us?

12:42.173 --> 12:43.861
Hiding something, maybe?

12:43.886 --> 12:45.736
Or maybe he's taking some time off

12:45.761 --> 12:47.947
after being buried alive
in a terrorist ambush.

12:47.972 --> 12:49.338
Could be, could be.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.736
A lot of agents lost
their lives in that raid.

12:52.475 --> 12:54.688
According to my notes here,
there's some discussion

12:54.713 --> 12:56.103
about whether or not
to abort the mission

12:56.128 --> 12:58.065
once you realized
communications were down.

12:58.090 --> 13:00.603
Now, do you agree with Assistant
Director Weller's decision

13:00.628 --> 13:01.945
to move in anyway?

13:01.970 --> 13:03.096
He didn't give that order.

13:03.121 --> 13:05.190
- Really? Who did?
- Nas Kamal.

13:05.215 --> 13:08.133
Nas Kamal. She's not
even an agent at the FBI.

13:08.134 --> 13:10.601
Why would she be giving
orders for assistant directors?

13:10.603 --> 13:12.970
The Sandstorm operation
is a joint task force.

13:12.972 --> 13:16.173
She was leading the
operation in Weller's absence.

13:16.175 --> 13:18.909
So you're saying that
Assistant Director Weller

13:18.934 --> 13:20.729
was absent...

13:20.754 --> 13:24.112
for the biggest FBI
tragedy in recent memory?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.088
He was lured away by someone claiming

13:26.113 --> 13:27.608
that the mother of his unborn child

13:27.610 --> 13:29.487
needed him at the hospital.

13:29.541 --> 13:31.260
Assistant Director Weller...

13:31.285 --> 13:33.377
still made it in time
to save Nas and Reade.

13:33.402 --> 13:35.517
I'm well aware of his
heroics after the fact,

13:35.542 --> 13:37.809
but why do you think
the same terrorist group

13:37.811 --> 13:39.478
that killed so many other agents

13:39.480 --> 13:42.072
work to keep him out of harm's way?

13:42.338 --> 13:44.698
What makes Assistant Director Weller

13:44.723 --> 13:46.876
so valuable to them?

13:57.020 --> 13:58.543
All right.

13:59.402 --> 14:01.031
I'll go through the front.

14:01.033 --> 14:03.334
You guys cover the back
just in case he runs.

14:03.336 --> 14:05.114
This guy's a music teacher, right?

14:05.139 --> 14:06.304
You really think he's gonna run?

14:06.306 --> 14:08.240
Well, sometimes people surprise you.

14:10.364 --> 14:11.560
You hear that?

14:12.455 --> 14:14.168
Go around the back.

14:27.106 --> 14:28.395
Eli...

14:29.336 --> 14:30.806
we're with the FBI.

14:30.808 --> 14:32.641
We're here to help you, not hurt you.

14:33.170 --> 14:34.409
I just want to ask you some questions

14:34.411 --> 14:35.795
about your foster home.

14:35.820 --> 14:38.788
I didn't kill Amber. They did!

14:38.790 --> 14:40.303
Who's they?

14:43.514 --> 14:45.583
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:45.608 --> 14:47.308
What brings you to paradise?

14:47.310 --> 14:50.256
I need that autopsy on
Amber Wallace right away.

14:50.281 --> 14:52.680
Maybe I could observe and
report the findings to my team.

14:52.682 --> 14:53.981
She's not mine anymore.

14:53.983 --> 14:55.683
Her family requested she transfer

14:55.685 --> 14:56.817
to another jurisdiction.

14:56.842 --> 14:58.452
- Her family?
- Yeah.

14:58.454 --> 15:00.547
Two guys just came by
with the transfer papers.

15:00.572 --> 15:03.006
Left with the body a couple minutes ago.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.845
- Excuse me! Hey!
- Come on, let's go!

15:08.847 --> 15:10.513
Hey! FBI!

15:23.696 --> 15:26.023
Does he remind you of anyone?

15:29.172 --> 15:31.828
You mean, does he remind me of myself?

15:32.047 --> 15:33.781
We're both orphans. Other than that,

15:33.806 --> 15:35.906
I don't see many similarities.

15:36.422 --> 15:38.375
Eli's never killed anyone.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.233
How can you be so sure?

15:40.258 --> 15:41.924
I don't remember much,

15:41.926 --> 15:45.188
but I remember the first
time I took someone's life.

15:47.852 --> 15:50.133
It takes something from you too.

15:50.336 --> 15:53.039
Eli's not scared of himself.

15:53.633 --> 15:55.867
He's scared of something else.

15:56.602 --> 15:59.643
Eli, do you know where
your foster family could be?

15:59.645 --> 16:01.311
Your brothers and sisters.

16:01.313 --> 16:03.313
Your foster mom, Carol.

16:03.315 --> 16:06.283
They could be in danger, so
if you know where they are,

16:06.285 --> 16:07.945
you need to tell us.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.768
How do I know you're
not with those people?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.270
Which people?

16:13.272 --> 16:14.897
Amber meant a lot to you, didn't she?

16:14.922 --> 16:16.139
She was like my sister.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.642
Oh, I believe you that
you didn't kill her,

16:18.906 --> 16:20.611
but if you know who did,

16:20.613 --> 16:23.225
we can make sure
they're held responsible,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.250
but we're gonna need your help, Eli.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.328
I-I just...

16:29.212 --> 16:30.805
I can't...

16:32.758 --> 16:34.749
Look, we're getting nowhere with Eli,

16:34.774 --> 16:35.883
so tell me you found something

16:35.908 --> 16:37.602
on the missing kids or their foster mom.

16:37.627 --> 16:40.180
I wish I could, but it's like
they just vanished into thin air.

16:40.205 --> 16:41.437
The music teacher...

16:41.462 --> 16:43.018
any idea why Eli was trying to find him?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.268
He's been vacationing in Rio,

16:44.293 --> 16:46.674
had no idea Eli was
camping out at his place,

16:46.699 --> 16:49.165
and the men who took
Amber's body from the morgue

16:49.190 --> 16:51.916
got it by using
fraudulent transfer papers.

16:51.941 --> 16:53.491
Any idea where they took the body?

16:53.493 --> 16:55.447
They ditched the van
they used off Highway 87,

16:55.472 --> 16:57.362
burned to a crisp, no bodies inside.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.032
This whole thing seems like a cover-up,

16:59.057 --> 17:01.106
but what are they covering?

17:01.131 --> 17:02.897
Eli's our best lead,

17:02.899 --> 17:04.675
but we've got to get him to open up.

17:05.432 --> 17:08.069
That, um... that thing
Eli was playing with

17:08.070 --> 17:09.955
at the house...

17:09.981 --> 17:12.321
- where is it?
- The pitch pipe?

17:12.347 --> 17:13.746
We took it from him in processing.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.573
I think you should give it back to him.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.214
He brought it with him
from the foster home.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.936
It obviously means something to him,

17:18.962 --> 17:20.361
like our coin.

17:20.386 --> 17:23.020
It could establish trust
and get him talking.

17:23.021 --> 17:25.698
All right. That's a
good point. Let's get it.

17:25.723 --> 17:26.990
I just finished up with Weitz.

17:27.015 --> 17:28.596
Jane, you're up next.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.395
You ever been in a romantic relationship

17:31.397 --> 17:32.863
with Assistant Director Weller?

17:32.865 --> 17:35.376
How is that relevant
to this investigation?

17:35.401 --> 17:37.301
You're an outlier, Jane.

17:37.303 --> 17:39.897
You were never trained by
the FBI. You're barely vetted.

17:39.922 --> 17:41.805
I'm trying to understand how
you're allowed in the field at all,

17:41.807 --> 17:43.435
but if you two were an item...

17:43.460 --> 17:47.128
No, I've never had a romantic
relationship with Kurt Weller.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.496
I've earned my spot on this team

17:48.498 --> 17:50.763
by proving myself time and time again.

17:50.788 --> 17:51.933
Was one of those times when you had

17:51.935 --> 17:53.324
your brother in your custody

17:53.349 --> 17:55.666
and instead of taking
him directly to the FBI,

17:55.691 --> 17:57.973
you wiped his memory with drugs

17:57.975 --> 17:59.871
and then lost him instead?

17:59.896 --> 18:02.197
It sounds like you already
have an opinion on that.

18:02.199 --> 18:05.183
Were your actions intended to
protect your brother or yourself?

18:05.208 --> 18:07.511
What did your brother know that
you didn't want brought to light?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.589
Look, Roman would have
killed me or died trying

18:09.614 --> 18:11.814
before letting me bring him to the FBI,

18:11.816 --> 18:15.144
so wiping his memory was
the only option I had.

18:15.169 --> 18:17.346
And this call that you made to erase

18:17.371 --> 18:19.760
all the knowledge from
your most valuable asset,

18:19.785 --> 18:22.152
was that made with Assistant
Director Weller's approval?

18:22.177 --> 18:23.996
No. I made it on my own.

18:24.021 --> 18:26.263
Was Assistant Director
Weller upset about that,

18:26.288 --> 18:29.122
that you made a very
personal decision on your own?

18:29.124 --> 18:30.557
Were you reprimanded?

18:30.559 --> 18:33.570
Weller trusts me.
We're on the same page.

18:33.595 --> 18:37.045
If your loyalties are with
your brother or yourself

18:37.085 --> 18:40.460
and not with the FBI or your country,

18:40.484 --> 18:43.952
where does that leave Assistant
Director Weller's loyalties,

18:43.977 --> 18:46.859
since he's on the same page?

18:51.332 --> 18:53.828
Boy, you are a popular guy.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.359
_

18:59.606 --> 19:02.107
Is that your wife? Girlfriend?

19:02.132 --> 19:04.696
No wife, no girlfriend, not even a dog.

19:04.698 --> 19:06.397
Well, that's too bad.

19:06.399 --> 19:08.904
That would have been cool if
that was your schnauzer calling.

19:11.031 --> 19:13.094
Can you imagine...

19:13.119 --> 19:15.073
a dog dialing a phone?

19:20.305 --> 19:22.539
So, what's wrong with you, Travis?

19:22.735 --> 19:24.609
Kidney, liver.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.703
Who knew all those years
of hard drinking and drugs

19:27.728 --> 19:30.102
would have such consequences?

19:30.867 --> 19:33.015
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.320
Two tours in Iraq and a
decade trying to erase it.

19:36.345 --> 19:39.613
The only thing that went
away was the wife and kids.

19:39.850 --> 19:42.629
But you've been ducking
phone calls all day.

19:42.654 --> 19:44.520
What are you trying to erase?

19:51.397 --> 19:53.858
We thought you might want that back.

19:53.883 --> 19:56.190
You know, like I said before, Eli,

19:56.192 --> 19:58.536
we want to find your foster family

19:58.561 --> 20:01.028
and we don't want what
happened to Amber...

20:01.030 --> 20:03.782
to happen to them too,
but we need your help.

20:03.807 --> 20:05.673
You need to talk to us.

20:05.675 --> 20:07.264
The sooner you tell us what you know,

20:07.289 --> 20:09.912
the faster we can make
sure everyone is safe.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.975
I don't know where they are.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.468
I ran after Amber jumped out the window.

20:16.493 --> 20:19.789
So she jumped. Why would she do that?

20:22.359 --> 20:23.929
Carol...

20:24.084 --> 20:26.086
Your foster mom?

20:26.111 --> 20:27.694
What about her?

20:27.719 --> 20:30.609
She gives us these pills every day,

20:30.859 --> 20:33.961
and the medicine was making
our heads all messed up.

20:33.963 --> 20:37.655
Carol said the feelings
would pass, but Amber,

20:38.850 --> 20:42.186
she was getting worse
and worse, and then...

20:43.711 --> 20:45.405
she just jumped.

20:45.772 --> 20:48.395
So, what was this medicine for?

20:48.420 --> 20:51.217
She said we had to
take it to feel better,

20:51.242 --> 20:52.657
like vitamins,

20:52.682 --> 20:55.616
that all the bad feelings
would go away eventually.

20:55.618 --> 20:58.252
Sometimes the doctor would
come by to check on us.

20:58.254 --> 21:00.405
I can't remember his name. It's...

21:00.430 --> 21:02.741
it's too hard to pronounce.

21:03.647 --> 21:06.474
We just called him Dr. S.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.997
If you didn't kill Amber,
then why did you run?

21:09.999 --> 21:12.010
Because I knew no one would believe me.

21:12.035 --> 21:14.310
That's why you went to
your music teacher's house.

21:14.335 --> 21:15.569
You trusted him.

21:15.594 --> 21:18.996
And I thought maybe
if I showed him this...

21:23.187 --> 21:24.889
maybe he could help.

21:26.959 --> 21:28.747
Have Patterson test
that pill, all right?

21:28.772 --> 21:30.304
We need to know what
it's supposed to treat.

21:30.329 --> 21:34.022
Got it. And I'll try
and track this "Dr. S."

21:36.046 --> 21:39.686
Assistant Director
Weller, it's that time.

21:41.077 --> 21:43.646
How would you describe your
relationship with Jane Doe?

21:43.671 --> 21:46.405
- Professional.
- Exclusively?

21:47.639 --> 21:50.975
Uh, we go out for beers
after work sometimes.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.212
So, professional and personal. Got it.

21:53.214 --> 21:54.624
How would you describe your relationship

21:54.649 --> 21:56.415
with Jane Doe's mother?

21:57.061 --> 21:58.998
She's the leader of the
terrorist organization

21:59.039 --> 22:00.788
we're trying to stop.

22:00.922 --> 22:02.203
She's my enemy.

22:02.228 --> 22:04.690
"Enemy." That's not a word I would use

22:04.692 --> 22:06.572
for someone who paid for my schooling.

22:06.597 --> 22:09.164
Wouldn't "benefactor" be more apt?

22:09.166 --> 22:11.788
I didn't know about that,
but she's still my enemy.

22:11.813 --> 22:13.764
She took out as many
FBI agents as she could

22:13.772 --> 22:15.405
during that compound raid.

22:15.407 --> 22:17.907
She killed her friend Sean
Clark right in front of you.

22:17.909 --> 22:20.310
Both times, you got to walk away.

22:20.335 --> 22:22.635
Seems like she's still
your benefactor to me,

22:22.637 --> 22:24.537
so what's in it for her?

22:25.413 --> 22:27.326
This is ridiculous.

22:27.351 --> 22:30.019
You really think that
I'm working for Sandstorm?

22:30.021 --> 22:31.694
On the surface, it seems absurd,

22:31.719 --> 22:33.469
but you look at the evidence

22:33.494 --> 22:36.053
and it starts to pile up pretty good.

22:36.078 --> 22:38.131
- Really?
- Shepherd paid for your schooling.

22:38.156 --> 22:39.241
She spared your life.

22:39.266 --> 22:41.573
Your not-so-professional relationship

22:41.598 --> 22:43.198
with her daughter, Jane Doe.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.747
You're trying to make
connections that aren't there,

22:44.772 --> 22:47.256
serving your own personal interests.

22:47.281 --> 22:49.175
I don't need a whole fire.

22:49.177 --> 22:50.947
I just need a little bit of smoke

22:50.972 --> 22:52.249
to bring this in front of Congress,

22:52.280 --> 22:54.947
and what I've got here is
a hell of a lot of smoke,

22:54.949 --> 22:56.928
Assistant Director Weller.

22:57.546 --> 22:59.449
How'd it go with Weitz?

23:00.225 --> 23:02.295
Let's just focus on the case.

23:02.483 --> 23:05.288
All right, the pill Eli gave
us isn't on the market yet.

23:05.290 --> 23:07.889
It's made up of compounds
found in most antidepressants,

23:07.914 --> 23:09.670
but it also has compound combinations

23:09.695 --> 23:12.288
- I've never seen in medications before.
- Like what?

23:12.313 --> 23:14.101
The hallmarks of these meds

23:14.126 --> 23:16.804
are erratic behavior
and suicidal tendencies,

23:16.829 --> 23:20.591
but this drug creates side effects
way more aggressive than normal.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.452
Do you think the foster
mom is getting paid

23:22.477 --> 23:24.600
by the charity foundation
to test this drug?

23:24.625 --> 23:25.820
Why would someone do that?

23:25.822 --> 23:28.639
It would give them an edge on
getting it to the marketplace faster.

23:28.664 --> 23:29.975
They're using these foster kids

23:30.000 --> 23:31.575
to perform illegal drug tests.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.504
That's what the tattoo was pointing at.

23:33.529 --> 23:36.272
And whatever company's behind this
is trying to remove the evidence.

23:36.766 --> 23:38.132
If those kids are still alive,

23:38.134 --> 23:39.889
they're in serious danger.

23:45.575 --> 23:47.341
We should take care of
the rest of them now.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.874
No! This is not what I agreed to!

23:49.899 --> 23:51.632
Do you think that I want to do this?

23:51.634 --> 23:53.167
If we're caught now,

23:53.169 --> 23:54.902
this will all have been for nothing.

23:54.904 --> 23:58.296
I need time to correct for this.

23:58.321 --> 24:00.407
Their sacrifice will allow us

24:00.409 --> 24:02.142
to save millions of others someday.

24:02.144 --> 24:04.111
Can't we just place them
out of state somewhere?

24:04.113 --> 24:05.312
Surely there has to be another way.

24:05.314 --> 24:07.748
If they ever talked, we'd spend
the rest of our lives in prison.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.867
Are you willing to take that risk?

24:11.719 --> 24:13.257
Will they feel anything?

24:13.282 --> 24:15.664
It would be like they're falling asleep.

24:16.023 --> 24:19.658
Maybe I could read to
them when you do it?

24:19.882 --> 24:21.468
That would be nice.

24:21.493 --> 24:22.959
Do whatever you want, Carol,

24:22.984 --> 24:25.195
but the longer we wait,
the riskier it gets.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.679
Someone at the morgue was on to us,

24:26.704 --> 24:29.601
and we still have one
subject in the wind.

24:30.615 --> 24:32.951
We finish the detox first.

24:32.976 --> 24:35.809
Another hour, their
systems will be clean.

24:35.834 --> 24:38.351
Then we proceed with final injections.

24:53.302 --> 24:54.970
Where is that damn remote?

24:56.749 --> 24:58.278
Whoa, what are you doing?

24:58.303 --> 25:00.092
You know...

25:00.460 --> 25:03.647
the nurse said hockey is bad
for my blood pressure, but...

25:04.178 --> 25:06.748
if I watch one more home design show,

25:06.750 --> 25:08.383
I'm gonna start knocking down walls.

25:08.439 --> 25:10.232
Whoa, that's probably not a good idea.

25:10.257 --> 25:11.560
I got it.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.749
Whoa, whoa.

25:12.774 --> 25:15.261
Hey, easy. You all right?

25:15.286 --> 25:16.652
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

25:16.677 --> 25:18.124
I'm sorry.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.656
You okay?

25:22.025 --> 25:24.428
Uh, no.

25:26.319 --> 25:28.158
When I first got back
from my deployment,

25:28.183 --> 25:30.383
I tried booze and pills...

25:30.999 --> 25:33.075
to get control of my life again.

25:33.100 --> 25:36.131
Now I can't even get up...

25:37.374 --> 25:40.092
and change the damn channel.

25:40.944 --> 25:42.905
I tell you what,

25:43.788 --> 25:45.355
you've got to figure out the right way

25:45.380 --> 25:47.194
to gain control of your life,

25:47.482 --> 25:49.506
'cause the wrongs ways,

25:50.548 --> 25:52.842
you don't want to see
where that ends up,

25:53.171 --> 25:54.626
believe me.

25:55.410 --> 25:57.443
What's the right way?

25:58.787 --> 26:01.186
You can't keep it inside.

26:02.116 --> 26:04.248
You've got to talk about it,

26:04.716 --> 26:07.295
no matter how much you don't want to.

26:19.507 --> 26:21.421
When I was younger...

26:27.020 --> 26:28.863
there was this coach.

26:31.728 --> 26:33.961
My forensic accountants
were able to trace

26:33.963 --> 26:36.307
the money Roman withdrew
from the Alice Kruger account.

26:36.332 --> 26:38.640
- And?
- And it's laundered...

26:38.665 --> 26:41.186
through a number of blind
trusts and offshore banks,

26:41.211 --> 26:42.484
but we're closing in fast.

26:42.509 --> 26:44.390
If Weitz gets his
way, that won't matter.

26:44.415 --> 26:45.922
The charges he's brought are ludicrous.

26:45.947 --> 26:47.599
Yeah, to us, all right?

26:47.624 --> 26:49.324
But to a Congressional hearing,

26:49.349 --> 26:52.517
my connections to Shepherd
put the entire team at risk.

26:55.219 --> 26:56.392
_

26:56.417 --> 26:57.992
It's Patterson.

27:01.761 --> 27:03.261
Please give me some good news.

27:03.263 --> 27:05.780
Since the analysis of
the medicine came back

27:05.805 --> 27:07.198
with nothing we could identify,

27:07.200 --> 27:09.816
I decided to take a look
at the capsule itself.

27:09.841 --> 27:11.273
How does that help us find the kids?

27:11.275 --> 27:12.711
Only four pharmaceutical companies

27:12.736 --> 27:14.677
carry this specific capsule.

27:14.679 --> 27:17.380
We pulled employee records with
photos and showed them to Eli.

27:17.382 --> 27:19.815
Meet Dr. S.,

27:19.950 --> 27:22.348
the one Eli said was
checking in on them.

27:22.373 --> 27:25.344
Dr. Ronald "Scrizzy"...

27:25.369 --> 27:26.617
"Scurzy"...

27:26.642 --> 27:28.094
Why do I have to say these names first?

27:28.119 --> 27:29.547
Skrzypacz.

27:29.572 --> 27:31.015
I have a Polish uncle.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.633
He's the lead of the research
team at Vanek Pharmaceuticals.

27:33.658 --> 27:36.567
And he also has a
suspiciously high success rate

27:36.592 --> 27:39.402
of getting his medications
through the FDA process.

27:39.427 --> 27:41.781
Because he uses these
kids as the practice test.

27:41.806 --> 27:44.780
- Exactly.
- Where is Dr. Skrzypacz now?

27:44.805 --> 27:47.163
We tracked his cell
to his medical office,

27:47.165 --> 27:48.698
but his assistant
hasn't seen him all day.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.166
So these kids are the only evidence

27:50.168 --> 27:52.023
that these experiments
actually took place.

27:52.048 --> 27:53.775
So how do we find him?

27:53.800 --> 27:55.562
We dangle a loose end.

27:57.219 --> 27:59.570
No, I-I can't.

28:00.070 --> 28:01.655
You're the only proof that we've got

28:01.680 --> 28:03.670
that Dr. S. was conducting these tests.

28:03.695 --> 28:05.109
Call his office, all right?

28:05.140 --> 28:07.707
Now, he'll ask to meet
you. It won't get that far.

28:07.709 --> 28:09.509
We'll track him using his phone.

28:09.511 --> 28:11.436
We'll find out where he is.

28:11.461 --> 28:13.725
Hopefully, we'll find the other kids.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.336
And Carol, you think she's okay?

28:17.765 --> 28:19.483
I don't know, Eli,

28:19.508 --> 28:23.058
but the other kids,
you can still help them.

28:23.508 --> 28:24.859
Okay.

28:26.297 --> 28:27.996
I'll do it.

28:28.766 --> 28:32.328
I don't remember much
from that time in my life.

28:32.353 --> 28:36.453
No idea what he did or didn't do to me,

28:37.132 --> 28:39.433
but he had a tape with my name on it.

28:39.458 --> 28:41.055
And now you have it.

28:41.079 --> 28:42.406
Yeah.

28:46.165 --> 28:48.633
I can't bring myself to watch it.

28:49.554 --> 28:51.117
You know,

28:51.645 --> 28:54.625
when I came back from my last tour,

28:56.746 --> 28:59.468
all my buddies who died over there,

29:00.656 --> 29:03.429
they kept visiting me in my sleep.

29:04.508 --> 29:06.804
I couldn't figure out...

29:08.714 --> 29:10.639
how to make 'em leave me alone.

29:10.664 --> 29:12.108
What'd you do?

29:12.133 --> 29:15.547
This shrink made me
look at their photos,

29:16.445 --> 29:18.687
photos of what happened to them.

29:19.773 --> 29:21.973
Yeah. When you watch this tape,

29:21.975 --> 29:24.376
whatever's on it becomes real,

29:24.758 --> 29:27.062
but it also becomes contained.

29:27.273 --> 29:30.179
You mind can stop trying
to fill in the blanks.

29:32.224 --> 29:34.544
If you spend your
life running from this,

29:34.569 --> 29:36.476
it's gonna eat you alive.

29:39.484 --> 29:42.734
Eli's phone call worked.
Dr. "Scrazzy," "Scrizzy"...

29:42.759 --> 29:44.185
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You get it.

29:44.187 --> 29:45.875
He left a message for Eli.

29:46.687 --> 29:48.389
Eli, it's Dr. S.

29:48.391 --> 29:50.351
It sounds like you
need medical attention.

29:50.376 --> 29:53.071
I can do a checkup, but you
have to tell me where you are.

29:53.096 --> 29:54.998
Call me on the number right away.

29:55.023 --> 29:56.464
We were able to trace the burner phone

29:56.466 --> 29:57.586
he left the voicemail on.

29:57.611 --> 29:59.534
- Where to?
- A warehouse in Queens.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.736
The lease was paid for
by a different 501-C

30:01.738 --> 30:03.506
but it's the same
shell company money maze

30:03.531 --> 30:05.008
as the one on Jane's tattoo.

30:05.033 --> 30:06.961
If the doctor's there, do
you think the kids are too?

30:06.986 --> 30:08.117
Let's hope so.

30:12.422 --> 30:15.531
We're here. Roman, you're unarmed,

30:15.556 --> 30:18.357
so you have to stay
close to us, understand?

30:18.382 --> 30:20.656
- Okay.
- All right, let's go.

30:27.555 --> 30:29.882
Al, you two cover the back.

30:30.030 --> 30:32.533
Jane, Roman, you've
got the side entrance.

30:32.558 --> 30:34.366
Tasha, you're with me.

30:37.601 --> 30:39.732
No, no! This is not okay!

30:39.734 --> 30:40.833
I never should have let
them talk me into this.

30:40.835 --> 30:42.535
FBI! Drop your weapons!

30:48.257 --> 30:49.710
Put it down!

30:52.900 --> 30:54.265
Stay down.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.660
Stay down. Don't!

30:57.685 --> 30:59.405
- Don't!
- Aah!

31:01.749 --> 31:03.747
- Where are the kids?
- There's a medical suite in the back,

31:03.772 --> 31:05.640
but I think it's too late.

31:22.170 --> 31:23.361
They're alive.

31:23.386 --> 31:24.800
Help! Please help!

31:24.802 --> 31:26.404
FBI! Stop!

31:27.085 --> 31:29.920
I've got him! Get the kids out of here!

31:30.264 --> 31:32.898
It's okay. We're here to help.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.656
I'll kill the power to the machines.

31:40.295 --> 31:41.725
Please let me go.

31:51.984 --> 31:53.483
Come on!

32:00.911 --> 32:03.044
In here, guys. Come on!

32:03.069 --> 32:04.369
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

32:39.141 --> 32:40.546
Where's Roman?

32:43.480 --> 32:44.772
Roman.

32:45.483 --> 32:46.682
Roman!

32:46.707 --> 32:48.288
Over here.

32:50.577 --> 32:53.163
It's okay. They're safe.

33:00.483 --> 33:03.298
Weller, how are they?

33:03.300 --> 33:04.991
There's no serious injuries,

33:05.016 --> 33:06.772
but there's no telling
what long-term effects

33:06.797 --> 33:08.364
those drugs may have.

33:08.389 --> 33:09.827
What about Eli?

33:09.852 --> 33:11.685
We brought him in to be evaluated.

33:11.749 --> 33:13.186
Tasha's checking on him now.

33:13.211 --> 33:14.786
So, where will they go?

33:14.811 --> 33:16.978
Social services will get them a new home

33:16.980 --> 33:18.346
and make sure they keep 'em together

33:18.348 --> 33:19.772
so they can help each other recover.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.263
- If they can recover.
- Yeah.

33:21.304 --> 33:23.325
Well, at least they'll be together.

33:23.350 --> 33:26.053
- You did great today.
- You did.

33:26.078 --> 33:28.381
Hey, we've got a problem.

33:28.410 --> 33:30.406
- Eli's not in his room.
- What?

33:30.431 --> 33:32.061
Come on.

33:37.171 --> 33:40.538
Eli, what are you doing?

33:41.338 --> 33:43.335
How could you do this to us?

33:43.360 --> 33:45.421
- To Amber?
- It's not what you think.

33:45.446 --> 33:47.108
You got paid to make us sick.

33:47.133 --> 33:49.077
No, no, the medicine
was supposed to help you.

33:49.079 --> 33:50.249
I care for all of you deeply.

33:50.274 --> 33:52.389
No, all you cared about is money.

33:52.952 --> 33:54.249
Eli.

33:54.274 --> 33:55.577
Eli,

33:55.602 --> 33:56.891
put the scissors down.

33:56.916 --> 33:58.546
Amber is dead because of her.

33:58.571 --> 33:59.772
And she's under arrest.

33:59.797 --> 34:01.303
She will pay for what she's
done, I give you my word.

34:01.328 --> 34:02.826
- That's not good enough.
- Eli.

34:02.851 --> 34:05.251
Eli, please, just tell me what you want.

34:05.276 --> 34:08.116
- I want Amber back.
- Eli, don't let what she's done,

34:08.149 --> 34:09.598
ruin the rest of your life.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.099
It already has.

34:11.101 --> 34:12.400
She can't hurt you anymore.

34:12.402 --> 34:13.969
The things that you've
had to go through,

34:13.994 --> 34:15.668
they can make you stronger,

34:15.693 --> 34:17.793
but you have to make the right choices.

34:17.819 --> 34:21.364
You can start by putting
those scissors down.

34:22.212 --> 34:23.482
Eli...

34:24.139 --> 34:26.053
put 'em down.

34:27.685 --> 34:29.117
There you go, there you go.

34:29.119 --> 34:30.918
Drop 'em. Drop 'em.

34:32.121 --> 34:34.589
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:35.027 --> 34:36.442
You're okay.

34:41.598 --> 34:44.043
- You wanted to see us?
- Yeah.

34:46.371 --> 34:49.306
Tasha, I want you to take point
on the Sandstorm operation.

34:49.409 --> 34:50.942
What are you talking about?

34:50.967 --> 34:52.279
What's going on?

34:52.304 --> 34:53.560
The only way that I can stop Weitz

34:53.585 --> 34:55.513
taking the entire team before Congress

34:55.538 --> 34:57.623
is if I take the blame
for everything myself.

34:57.648 --> 34:59.685
- You're just giving up?
- No, I'm not,

34:59.710 --> 35:01.276
but this is the only
play that we've got.

35:01.301 --> 35:03.544
This way, the team can
still take Sandstorm down.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.453
There is no team without you.

35:05.455 --> 35:06.833
Tasha, you'll run things

35:06.858 --> 35:08.372
until Pellington finds my replacement.

35:08.396 --> 35:09.713
You can't carry this by yourself.

35:09.738 --> 35:10.747
We'll fight it together.

35:10.771 --> 35:12.271
Our fight is with Sandstorm

35:12.274 --> 35:14.671
and we can't continue it if Weitz wins,

35:14.696 --> 35:16.238
so this is the only
way that I can protect

35:16.263 --> 35:17.763
the rest of you and the mission,

35:17.765 --> 35:19.045
and this is happening.

35:19.070 --> 35:20.390
It's my call.

35:22.403 --> 35:24.070
Can you please state for the record

35:24.072 --> 35:26.706
that your testimony here
today is fully voluntary,

35:26.708 --> 35:28.029
you're not compelled
to give this testimony

35:28.054 --> 35:29.387
by me or any third party

35:29.412 --> 35:30.895
and that your sworn statement

35:30.920 --> 35:33.286
is the complete and full truth?

35:33.864 --> 35:36.591
Yes. I'm here on my own accord.

35:36.616 --> 35:38.357
Well, let's get started.

35:38.841 --> 35:41.638
I'd like to begin by talking
about Assistant Director Weller.

35:41.663 --> 35:44.216
- Now, as I understand it...
- Let's save us both some time.

35:44.241 --> 35:46.515
- Excuse me?
- It was me.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.461
- What was you?
- All of it.

35:48.486 --> 35:50.779
Any perceived missteps
taken by this task force

35:50.804 --> 35:53.076
in our attempt to bring Sandstorm down,

35:53.101 --> 35:55.380
they're solely my responsibility.

35:55.747 --> 35:58.279
I alone made the
decision to send Jane in

35:58.304 --> 35:59.958
as an undercover operative.

35:59.983 --> 36:03.552
I alone let Nigel
Thornton, aka Robert Borden,

36:03.645 --> 36:05.794
undermine this entire operation,

36:06.223 --> 36:07.947
and I alone made the call

36:07.972 --> 36:10.740
to send FBI agents into
the Sandstorm compound,

36:10.765 --> 36:13.435
which resulted in multiple casualties,

36:15.338 --> 36:18.435
and I alone deserve to
suffer the consequences.

36:31.486 --> 36:33.384
- I know what you're doing.
- Telling the truth?

36:33.409 --> 36:34.990
Taking the heat off of everyone else

36:35.015 --> 36:37.181
by jumping in the fire yourself.

36:37.927 --> 36:40.291
Look, you're smarter than this, Matthew.

36:40.447 --> 36:42.025
You know that if you drag this team

36:42.050 --> 36:44.134
in front of a
Congressional subcommittee,

36:44.159 --> 36:45.525
you'll have a fight on your hands.

36:45.550 --> 36:46.900
Yeah, a fight I can win.

36:46.925 --> 36:48.558
A fight you might win.

36:49.072 --> 36:51.236
But if Weller brings
Shepherd in tomorrow,

36:51.261 --> 36:53.608
he'll be the hero and
you'll look like a fool.

36:53.783 --> 36:55.845
What I'm offering you is a sure thing,

36:55.870 --> 36:57.384
a guaranteed win.

36:57.409 --> 36:59.877
I can't name a single AUSA

36:59.902 --> 37:01.901
that has brought in a top NSA operative

37:01.926 --> 37:03.592
in front of Congress.

37:03.853 --> 37:05.752
It would be unprecedented.

37:05.806 --> 37:07.705
Or you can continue this witch hunt

37:07.730 --> 37:09.783
against Weller and his team and...

37:09.808 --> 37:11.439
I can promise you

37:11.464 --> 37:14.158
that I will use all my
substantial resources

37:14.183 --> 37:17.184
to find every last piece
of dirt on Matthew Weitz

37:17.209 --> 37:19.588
and pursue a hearing of my own.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.509
So, Mr. Weitz,

37:22.612 --> 37:24.118
your move.

37:29.666 --> 37:32.033
- We need to talk.
- It's too late for that.

37:32.058 --> 37:34.291
I already got myself a bigger fish.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.220
But if you want, we can
go for coffee sometime

37:39.222 --> 37:40.447
or tea or...

37:40.472 --> 37:41.627
Tell you what, you
figure out the beverage

37:41.652 --> 37:43.220
and give me a call, okay?

37:43.493 --> 37:45.564
See you on the Hill, Ms. Kamal.

37:46.477 --> 37:47.543
What have you done?

37:47.568 --> 37:49.908
This was the best way
to protect the team.

37:51.034 --> 37:52.697
I'm not gonna let you
take responsibility

37:52.722 --> 37:53.728
for my mistakes.

37:53.753 --> 37:55.019
Even if you take the blame,

37:55.044 --> 37:57.258
he could still come after everyone else.

37:57.283 --> 38:00.541
I'm not officially connected
to this office or the FBI.

38:00.566 --> 38:02.680
This way, he gets his win and...

38:02.705 --> 38:04.798
the team can continue
to fight Sandstorm.

38:04.823 --> 38:06.611
That is not your call to make.

38:06.636 --> 38:07.650
This is my team.

38:07.675 --> 38:09.916
Yes, and they need you desperately.

38:09.941 --> 38:11.975
Kurt, without you, there's
no hope of figuring out

38:12.000 --> 38:13.900
what Sandstorm is
planning for phase two,

38:13.925 --> 38:15.691
and I've been chasing
them for far too long.

38:15.716 --> 38:17.931
- It's time I passed the torch.
- Don't do this.

38:17.956 --> 38:19.723
It's already done, Kurt.

38:20.330 --> 38:22.230
Now, make sure it's worth it.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.926
Look at you, walking out of here.

38:28.283 --> 38:30.004
Lucky man.

38:30.006 --> 38:32.580
If I was lucky, I wouldn't have
ended up here in the first place.

38:32.605 --> 38:34.470
I was grading on a curve.

38:37.447 --> 38:39.744
You know what? Let me
leave you my number.

38:40.650 --> 38:42.142
Just in case.

38:42.167 --> 38:44.588
Just in case I need an FBI agent?

38:45.937 --> 38:48.456
In case you need somebody to
change the damn channel for you.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.181
Jackass.

38:52.762 --> 38:54.564
Take care of yourself.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.602
I'll try.

38:58.768 --> 39:00.236
Hey...

39:01.437 --> 39:03.369
if and when...

39:03.394 --> 39:06.306
you decide to face
those demons of yours,

39:06.976 --> 39:08.634
don't do it alone.

39:13.673 --> 39:16.095
I guess I won't be needing this anymore,

39:16.120 --> 39:19.127
but I thought we could
all do with one of these.

39:21.758 --> 39:24.689
It has been a distinct privilege

39:24.714 --> 39:26.104
to serve with each of you.

39:26.129 --> 39:27.939
The privilege has been all ours.

39:27.964 --> 39:30.369
You sacrificed your
entire career for us.

39:30.394 --> 39:34.072
I lost a battle so
you could win the war.

39:34.759 --> 39:36.470
I'll drink to that.

39:44.393 --> 39:46.259
My people just sent this.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.584
The accounts where Sandstorm
are holding their funds.

39:48.609 --> 39:50.291
You cut them off from their money,

39:50.316 --> 39:51.572
you back them into a corner,

39:51.597 --> 39:53.664
maybe force them to make a mistake.

39:53.689 --> 39:56.416
Or derail their plans altogether.

39:56.441 --> 39:58.774
That is one hell of
a going away present.

39:58.799 --> 40:00.361
I gotta say,

40:01.027 --> 40:03.767
none of us wanted you here...

40:03.933 --> 40:05.619
when this all started,

40:07.937 --> 40:11.166
but now, it's hard to imagine
this place without you.

40:11.572 --> 40:13.111
I never thought that I would be able

40:13.136 --> 40:14.884
to work with a team again,

40:16.680 --> 40:18.806
but I sure am gonna miss this one.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.953
Thank you, to all of you.

40:28.796 --> 40:30.298
Give them hell.

40:39.621 --> 40:42.111
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:45.041 --> 40:47.375
Hey, thanks for coming over.

40:48.642 --> 40:50.556
Thanks for calling me back.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.857
Sure you want to do this?

41:09.882 --> 41:12.805
No, but what I've been
doing isn't working.

41:14.070 --> 41:16.367
I'm tired of pretending like I'm okay.

41:17.555 --> 41:18.887
I need to know what happened to me

41:18.912 --> 41:20.321
so I can move on with my life.

42:00.914 --> 42:02.613
This is it...

42:02.733 --> 42:05.522
the last piece we need for phase two.

42:16.629 --> 42:19.456
Do I want to know why you need all this?

42:19.735 --> 42:22.776
I'm not paying you $20
million to ask questions,

42:23.260 --> 42:25.093
but if I was you,

42:25.118 --> 42:28.034
I'd avoid the Western
Hemisphere for a while.
