WEBVTT

00:13.067 --> 00:14.500
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.533 --> 00:16.333
(Meredith) PICK ME.
CHOOSE ME. LOVE ME.

00:16.367 --> 00:20.100
I NEED TO NOT DIE
EMOTIONALLY CRIPPLED AND ALONE.

00:20.133 --> 00:23.267
CALLIE... WHAT I DID TO YOU
I-IS UNFORGIVABLE.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.067
(Meredith) SO YOU TWO
ARE TOGETHER?
(George) YEAH.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.833
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE INAPPROPRIATE

00:26.867 --> 00:29.733
AND UNPROFESSIONAL.
DR. HAHN HAS AGREED
TO BECOME

00:29.767 --> 00:31.167
OUR NEW HEAD
OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.333
LOOKIN' FORWARD TO IT,
DR. YANG.
MY WIFE HAS FILED
FOR DIVORCE.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.300
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
ONE MORE NIGHT IN THAT HOTEL.

00:37.333 --> 00:41.367
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING TO ME.
I WANT TO MARRY YOU,
AND YOU'RE NOT READY.

00:42.633 --> 00:44.200
***

00:44.233 --> 00:46.733
(Meredith) THERE'S THIS THING
ABOUT BEING A SURGEON--

00:46.767 --> 00:48.100
MAYBE IT'S PRIDE

00:48.133 --> 00:50.033
OR MAYBE
IT'S JUST ABOUT BEING TOUGH--

00:50.067 --> 00:52.533
BUT A TRUE SURGEON
NEVER ADMITS THEY NEED HELP

00:52.567 --> 00:54.467
UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.400
(Cristina) OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOUR OTHER SYMPTOMS?

00:56.433 --> 00:59.100
OKAY,
THERE'S THE FATHER THING...

00:59.133 --> 01:00.333
MM-HMM.

01:00.367 --> 01:01.667
THE MOTHER THING,
THE SISTER THING...

01:01.700 --> 01:05.167
MM, THE DYING-AND-COMING-BACK-
TO-LIFE THING.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.100
YOU HAVE TOO MANY THINGS.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.500
I CAN'T SLEEP.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.767
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITHOUT THE DREAMING.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.667
AND THE PANIC ATTACKS.
ONE. ONE PANIC ATTACK.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.600
OKAY, STILL.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

01:14.633 --> 01:18.233
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
SEVERE ABANDONMENT ISSUES.

01:18.267 --> 01:19.800
(clicks tongue)

01:19.833 --> 01:23.300
THAT'S CRAP. PSYCH IS CRAP.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.633
ISSUES?
I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S IN THE BOOK.

01:25.667 --> 01:28.167
THE BOOK SAID IT,
NOT ME.
(sighs)

01:28.200 --> 01:30.367
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
MAYBE YOU AND DEREK SHOULD...

01:30.400 --> 01:33.367
STOP HAVING BREAKUP SEX?

01:33.400 --> 01:36.333
***

01:36.367 --> 01:38.633
OKAY.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.567
***

01:41.600 --> 01:44.567
THE MORE AVAILABLE HE GETS...

01:44.600 --> 01:47.033
THE MORE I PULL AWAY.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:49.467 --> 01:51.533
NOTHING.
IT'S A DEREK THING.

01:51.567 --> 01:53.500
SURGEONS DON'T NEED TO ASK
FOR HELP

01:53.533 --> 01:55.600
'CAUSE THEY'RE TOUGHER
THAN THAT.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.533
SURGEONS ARE COWBOYS--

01:57.567 --> 01:59.433
ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES,

01:59.467 --> 02:01.733
HARD-CORE.

02:01.767 --> 02:04.533
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT
THEY WANT YOU TO THINK.

02:04.567 --> 02:06.267
(Richard sighs)

02:06.300 --> 02:07.767
AH, GOOD MORNING.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.400
OH, PERFECT TIMING.

02:10.433 --> 02:11.633
TROUT FOR BREAKFAST.

02:11.667 --> 02:12.600
MM-HMM.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.300
AGAIN.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.033
YEAH, DON'T START.

02:18.067 --> 02:21.833
I LET YOU LIVE ON MY LAND,
SO DON'T--DON'T START.
I'M OLDER THAN YOU.

02:21.867 --> 02:25.067
I'VE JUST SEEN LIFE
FROM BOTH SIDES NOW.
YOU GONNA START SINGING?

02:25.100 --> 02:26.833
I'M JUST SAYING THAT A MAN

02:26.867 --> 02:28.767
WHO IS UP FISHING
AT 3:00 EVERY MORNING

02:28.800 --> 02:30.700
IS A MAN IN PAIN
OVER A WOMAN.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.500
OH, GOOD.
A COUNTRY-WESTERN SONG.

02:32.533 --> 02:35.800
I'M POINTING OUT IT'S A THING
WE HAVE IN COMMON, DEREK.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.233
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE NEED

02:39.267 --> 02:42.133
IS SOMETHING TO TAKE OUR MIND
OFF OF EVERYTHING.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.100
WHAT WE NEED...

02:44.133 --> 02:46.233
IS A GENTLEMEN'S EVENING.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.233
A WHAT?

02:48.267 --> 02:50.367
A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
GENTLEMEN'S EVENING...

02:50.400 --> 02:53.067
TONIGHT.

02:54.700 --> 02:58.000
(snoring)

03:00.067 --> 03:02.400
THIS IS ABSURD.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.800
(muffled) HEY.

03:07.833 --> 03:11.467
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SLEEPING
IN THE ON CALL ROOM.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.667
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
AN ON CALL ROOM.

03:13.700 --> 03:17.767
SOMETIMES IT'S A GURNEY
IN THE TUNNELS AND THE...

03:17.800 --> 03:19.467
IT'S ABSURD...

03:19.500 --> 03:21.433
WHEN I HAVE
A PERFECTLY GOOD BED.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.367
AND I KNOW THAT WE SAID
WE WOULD WAIT

03:23.400 --> 03:24.767
AND BE RESPECTFUL,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.167
AND WE HAVE BEEN
VERY RESPECTFUL.
MM-HMM.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.533
(lowered voice)
BUT NOW I WANT SEX.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.067
RIGHT NOW?

03:31.100 --> 03:32.800
(normal voice)
NO. TONIGHT.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.167
OH. OH.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.667
TONIGHT WE WILL HAVE...

03:35.700 --> 03:39.600
HOT, PERFECT SEX.

03:39.633 --> 03:40.800
YOU IN?

03:40.833 --> 03:42.500
YEAH, I'M OBVIOUSLY IN.

03:42.533 --> 03:45.333
MM.
I GOTTA GO.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.433
I GOT PATIENTS TO CHECK ON,
ERICA HAHN TO IMPRESS.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.367
I'M GONNA GO KICK
SOME CARDIO ASS.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.433
OH, GOD.
I GOTTA SHAVE MY LEGS.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.367
IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T,
YOU KNOW,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.267
HAVE A CHANCE
TO SHAVE YOUR LEGS.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.733
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT IS NOT OKAY, GEORGE.
EH.

03:57.767 --> 04:01.233
I HAVE TO SHAVE MY LEGS.
I WILL BE SHAVING MY LEGS.

04:01.267 --> 04:04.033
HOT, PERFECT SEX
REQUIRES SHAVED LEGS.
OKAY.

04:04.067 --> 04:06.633
ERICA HAHN--
FIRST DAY.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.433
OH, FIRST DAY INDEED,

04:08.467 --> 04:10.367
AND A MOUNTAIN OF PAPERWORK
TO PROVE IT.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.700
AH. DEREK SHEPHERD,
YOU KNOW ERICA HAHN.
YOU'RE THE NEW BURKE.

04:13.733 --> 04:16.300
AND THIS IS DR. MARK SLOAN,
HEAD OF PLASTICS.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.367
ERICA HAHN.
AH, THE NEW BURKE.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.033
(Derek) MM. WELCOME.

04:20.067 --> 04:22.233
EXCUSE US.

04:22.267 --> 04:25.300
INTERESTING GUYS,
AND BY "INTERESTING"

04:25.333 --> 04:26.800
I MEAN
"RIDICULOUSLY ATTRACTIVE."

04:26.833 --> 04:28.000
(laughs)

04:28.033 --> 04:31.500
DO YOU HIRE ON LOOKS ALONE,
OR IS ACTUAL SKILL A FACTOR?

04:31.533 --> 04:33.433
GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE,
ERICA.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.300
GOOD TO BE HERE, RICHARD.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.233
WHAT EXACTLY IS
A GENTLEMEN'S EVENING?

04:37.267 --> 04:39.167
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S AN EVENING WITH GENTLEMEN.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.533
AND STRIPPERS?

04:40.567 --> 04:43.033
NO, I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
THE CHIEF MEANT STRIPPERS.

04:43.067 --> 04:45.533
SURE SOUNDS LIKE STRIPPERS.
DR. BAILEY?

04:45.567 --> 04:47.767
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES TO MIND

04:47.800 --> 04:50.100
WHEN I SAY THE WORDS
"GENTLEMEN'S EVENING"?
TASSELS.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.700
SHINY, SEQUINED TASSELS
AND $1 BILLS.

04:52.733 --> 04:54.233
SEE? STRIPPERS.

04:54.267 --> 04:56.500
THERE WILL BE NO STRIPPERS.
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.433
SO YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS THING IS EITHER?

04:58.467 --> 05:00.367
NO, BUT YOU'RE IN?
WHY NOT?
I LIKE TO BE SURPRISED.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.233
OKAY.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.600
OH, HEADS-UP.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.333
MR. INCREDIBLE, 12:00.

05:04.367 --> 05:06.500
HI.

05:06.533 --> 05:07.833
HI.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.767
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.700
THAT WAS ABOUT A DATE
WE HAVE LATER

05:11.733 --> 05:13.600
IN THE ON CALL ROOM.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.533
IT'S NOTHING.
WELL, YOU SURE SEEM TO BE
LOSING SLEEP

05:15.567 --> 05:17.467
OVER A WHOLE LOT
OF "NOTHING."

05:17.500 --> 05:19.400
THIS IS IT--
HAHN IS IN THE HOSPITAL,

05:19.433 --> 05:21.333
FREAKIN' IZZIE
IS ON HER SERVICE AGAIN.

05:21.367 --> 05:24.233
I'M GONNA RIDE THIS TRAUMA TRAIN
STRAIGHT BACK INTO CARDIO.

05:24.267 --> 05:25.467
OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

05:25.500 --> 05:27.133
UH, TWO AMBULANCES,
MULTIPLE TRAUMAS.

05:27.167 --> 05:29.467
ANY CHANCE YOU NEED
A RESIDENT'S HELP, DR. TORRES?

05:29.500 --> 05:32.367
AS LONG AS YOU WANT
TO SMASH BONES INTO DUST

05:32.400 --> 05:34.300
WHILE PEOPLE CRY.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.667
SWEET.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

05:35.700 --> 05:37.667
CHEST PAIN, TAMPONADE,
RUPTURED AORTA?

05:37.700 --> 05:39.367
UH, MORE LIKE A CLOWN CAR.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.267
JACKIE ESCOTT, 25 YEARS OLD--
DISLOCATED SHOULDER

05:42.300 --> 05:44.500
LAC TO HER THIGH,
VITAL SIGNS ARE STABLE.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.300
AND HELENA BOYD,
26 YEARS OLD--

05:46.333 --> 05:48.667
ALSO STABLE
WITH OBVIOUS NASAL FRACTURE

05:48.700 --> 05:51.133
FACIAL LACS AND A CHUNK
OF MISSING SCALP.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.167
SHE RIPPED OUT MY HAIR.
SHE RIPPED OUT MY SHOULDER!

05:53.200 --> 05:55.033
YOU RIPPED OUT YOUR OWN SHOULDER
WHEN YOU WERE TRYING

05:55.067 --> 05:56.800
TO PUSH ME
OFF OF THE PLATFORM!
WHO LET GO OF THE DRESS?

05:56.833 --> 05:58.367
DID ANYBODY LET GO
OF THE DRESS?
HANG IN THERE, HONEY.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.700
DON'T LET HER PSYCH YOU OUT,
ALL RIGHT?
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL'S
ALL THIS?

06:01.733 --> 06:03.067
IT'S A STORE CONTEST.
I'M THE JUDGE.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.633
LAST ONE TO LET GO
OF THE DRESS--
WINS THE WEDDING OF MY DREAMS.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.767
OF MY DREAMS.
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.433
YOU TWO ARE INJURED, OKAY?

06:09.467 --> 06:12.033
YOU NEED TO GET YOUR PRIORITIES
STRAIGHT AND LET GO OF THE--

06:12.067 --> 06:14.367
LET GO--LET GO OF THE DRESS
SO WE CAN TREAT YOU.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.533
ALL RIGHT, LET GO NOW.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.100
NOW.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.467
YEAH.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.067
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
LET'S MOVE.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.133
(siren whoops)

06:26.167 --> 06:27.367
(wailing)

06:27.400 --> 06:29.300
OH, PLEASE LET THIS BE
SOMETHING GOOD,

06:29.333 --> 06:32.033
SOMETHING CARDIO GOOD.
PLEASE.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.400
(man) 33-YEAR-OLD MALE

06:33.433 --> 06:34.767
DISCOVERED UNCONSCIOUS
BUT STABLE

06:34.800 --> 06:37.300
HAVING SURVIVED
A 12,000-FOOT FREE FALL.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.500
A WHAT?

06:38.533 --> 06:40.333
HIS PARACHUTE DIDN'T OPEN.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.300
WAIT, HE FELL 12,000 FEET
WITHOUT A PARACHUTE?

06:42.333 --> 06:44.333
(moans)
THANK YOU.

06:47.833 --> 06:49.467
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.067
RICK. I'M RICK JACOBS.
OW.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.267
HE'S TALKING?
(Cristina) YOU'D THINK
AFTER 12,000 FEET,

06:54.300 --> 06:56.667
HE'D HAVE AT LEAST
A PUNCTURED LUNG.
(woman) WHERE IS HE?
WHERE ARE YOU?

06:56.700 --> 06:58.667
OH, MY GOD. THERE YOU ARE.
HOW IS HE?

06:58.700 --> 07:01.200
HOW IS HE? IS HE OKAY?
IS HE DYING?

07:01.233 --> 07:03.767
NO, I'M NOT DYING,
SALLY.
OKAY, MA'AM,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.067
IS THIS YOUR WIFE?

07:05.100 --> 07:06.567
MY SKYDIVING INSTRUCTOR.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.700
WELL, MA'AM--
I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING.

07:08.733 --> 07:10.267
I-I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.500
I WAS JUST--I WAS JUST
IN THE CLOUDS FLOATING,

07:12.533 --> 07:15.300
WATCHING WHILE HE--WHILE HE--
WHILE HE--YOU--

07:15.333 --> 07:17.633
YOU FELL TO YOUR DEATH.
HIS CHUTE DIDN'T OPEN.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.400
MA'AM, OKAY,
WE NEED TO DO OUR JOBS,

07:19.433 --> 07:22.133
AND YOU'RE MAKING THAT DIFFICULT
BY HOVERING OVER THE PATIENT.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.833
P-PLEASE HAVE A SEAT
AND BREATHE.

07:24.867 --> 07:28.633
I HEARD WE HAVE A SKYDIVER
WHO FELL 12,000 FEET.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.367
THAT'D BE ME.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.567
UH... HELLO.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.500
HI.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.167
HE'S TALKING?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.533
CLEARLY HE'S IN SHOCK,

07:37.567 --> 07:40.533
CAN'T FEEL THE EXTENT
OF HIS INJURIES.

07:40.567 --> 07:43.133
LET'S GET HIM DOWN
FOR A C.T.

07:43.167 --> 07:44.567
CRISTINA,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

07:44.600 --> 07:47.267
MULTIPLE INJURIES
MEANS MULTIPLE SURGERIES.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.067
I'M GOING TO GET ME
SOME CARDIO.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.800
OKAY, DO YOU SEE THAT YOU'RE
BLEEDING ALL OVER THE DRESS?

07:51.833 --> 07:53.733
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DRESS.
I CAN'T, UH, I CAN'T--

07:53.767 --> 07:56.633
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLOOD
DOWN HERE.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.567
WHICH ONE OF YOUR LEGS
IS BLEEDING?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.500
I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T REALLY
FEEL ANYTHING ANYMORE.

08:00.533 --> 08:02.433
I HEAR YOU HAVE
A BROKEN NOSE DOWN HERE.

08:02.467 --> 08:04.333
WHAT'S WITH THE DRESS?
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DRESS.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.267
CAN'T THEY--CAN'T THEY JUST
SPLIT THE PRIZE?

08:06.300 --> 08:08.700
I OFFERED.
I OFFERED THAT 14 HOURS AGO.

08:08.733 --> 08:10.633
IT IS
A $100,000 WEDDING PACKAGE,

08:10.667 --> 08:13.400
AND I AM NOT SPLITTING IT
WITH ANYONE.

08:13.433 --> 08:15.067
(George) OH, YOU'RE BLEEDING
ON YOUR DRESS.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.067
(men and women)
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DRESS!

08:17.100 --> 08:20.533
UH, UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
STABILIZE THAT SHOULDER SOMEHOW.
I'LL GO GRAB A SLING.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.467
WELL, THIS IS COZY.
THIS IS HELL.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.467
I ASSIGNED O'MALLEY TO YOU
TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME,

08:24.500 --> 08:26.400
AND NOW OUR PATIENTS
ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER.

08:26.433 --> 08:29.233
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS
LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY IT IS.
MEANING?

08:29.267 --> 08:30.600
MEANING HE'S AN INTERN.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.633
IT'S, LIKE, HALF MY JOB,
TORTURING INTERNS.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.333
(laughs) THANKS. THAT'S--
THAT'S ALMOST SWEET.

08:34.367 --> 08:36.033
BUT TORTURING GEORGE

08:36.067 --> 08:38.167
IS NOT GONNA MAKE
ANY OF THIS ANY BETTER.

08:40.733 --> 08:43.667
TORTURE HIM HOW, EXACTLY?

08:43.700 --> 08:47.500
MY HANDS ALWAYS GET
SO SWEATY IN HOSPITALS.

08:47.533 --> 08:50.100
IT'S THE WEIRDEST THING.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.233
IT'S PRETTY COMMON,
ACTUALLY.

08:52.267 --> 08:54.533
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

08:54.567 --> 08:57.167
DR. HAHN HAS DONE THIS PROCEDURE
HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.033
AND SHE'S REALLY GONNA THREAD
A CATHETER UP MY LEG,

09:00.067 --> 09:01.800
ALL THE WAY TO MY HEART?

09:01.833 --> 09:04.067
TRUST ME,
YOU ARE IN EXCELLENT HANDS.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.733
BUT, UM, I--I'LL BE OUT,
RIGHT?

09:06.767 --> 09:10.500
OH, YEAH, YOU'LL BE ASLEEP.
YOU WON'T REMEMBER A THING.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.567
IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER.
I'M SORRY?

09:13.600 --> 09:15.500
IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER--

09:15.533 --> 09:18.333
THAT'S WHAT'S GETTING ME
THROUGH THIS.

09:18.367 --> 09:21.567
I'M A, UH,
LIFELONG BIRDWATCHER.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.667
OH.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.833
AND WHEN I GET THROUGH THIS,

09:24.867 --> 09:28.200
I AM FINALLY GOING TO SCOUT
THE IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.800
IT IS SO RARE.

09:30.833 --> 09:34.467
YOU KNOW, WE--WE THOUGHT
IT WAS EXTINCT.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.433
BUT IT'S NOT.

09:36.467 --> 09:39.267
IT LIVES IN ARKANSAS...

09:39.300 --> 09:43.533
IN THIS ONE
LITTLE PATCH OF SWAMP.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.167
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW INCREDIBLE IT IS

09:48.200 --> 09:50.767
TO SEE A BIRD LIKE THAT
IN PERSON?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.367
(clears throat)

09:54.233 --> 09:55.533
I'M SORRY.

09:55.567 --> 09:57.567
UH, I'LL BE JUST ONE SECOND.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
WHY ARE YOU HOVERING?

09:59.533 --> 10:01.433
GUESS WHAT JUST
CAME INTO THE PIT.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.367
NO, NO, DON'T GUESS.
I'LL TELL YOU.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.467
SKYDIVER.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.833
SKYDIVER WHOSE CHUTE
DIDN'T OPEN,

10:05.867 --> 10:09.200
WHO FELL 12,000 FEET
AND LANDED IN SOME SHRUBBERY.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.367
WOW. POOR GUY. HE PROBABLY
BROKE EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.300
NO, THE POINT
IS NOT "POOR GUY."

10:14.333 --> 10:15.800
THE POINT IS AMAZING SURGERY.

10:15.833 --> 10:20.100
AND IT COULD BE YOURS
FOR THE LOW, LOW PRICE

10:20.133 --> 10:23.833
OF A HUMDRUM,
EVERYDAY CARDIO CATH.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.333
YEAH, FORGET IT. I'M NOT
GIVING UP HAHN'S SERVICE.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.700
HEY, HEY, IZZIE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
CARDIO IS MY THING.

10:28.733 --> 10:31.300
NO. I LIKE THIS PATIENT,
I LIKE HAHN,

10:31.333 --> 10:33.167
AND I LIKE CARDIO.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.100
NO, YOU ARE--
YOU ARE FLIRTING WITH CARDIO.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.267
I AM MARRIED TO CARDIO.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.767
YOU WILL MARRY
GENERAL SURGERY

10:39.800 --> 10:41.700
OR, YOU KNOW,
OKAY, PERHAPS NEURO.

10:41.733 --> 10:42.700
(scoffs)

10:42.733 --> 10:46.133
BUT YOU, YOU ARE NOWHERE NEAR
HARD-CORE ENOUGH

10:46.167 --> 10:48.533
TO COMMIT TO CARDIO.

10:48.567 --> 10:52.467
SO YOU ARE TELLING ME TO STOP
FLIRTING WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.400
(chuckles) I GET IT.
THAT'S CUTE.

10:54.433 --> 10:56.333
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME
FOR A FAVOR,

10:56.367 --> 10:59.100
INSULTING MY PERSONAL LIFE
IS PROBABLY NOT A GREAT TACTIC.

10:59.133 --> 11:01.433
NO, NO, NO, WAIT. I AM NOT
TALKING ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE.

11:01.467 --> 11:03.733
I COULD NOT CARE LESS
ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.767
IT'S A SKYDIVER, IZZIE.
SKYDIVER.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.133
OH, YEAH. SOUNDS REAL COOL.
ENJOY IT.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.667
(Richard) IF HIS INTESTINES LOOK
LIKE I THINK THEY WILL,

11:10.700 --> 11:12.200
THAT'S GONNA TAKE
FIRST PRIORITY.

11:12.233 --> 11:14.467
HE COULD HAVE
DELAYED PARALYSIS.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.033
THIS IS NOT A CONTEST,
GENTLEMEN.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.800
BUT SINCE A PERFED BOWEL
COULD KILL THE GUY

11:18.833 --> 11:20.733
WHETHER OR NOT HIS SPINE'S
IN WORKING ORDER,

11:20.767 --> 11:23.267
MY MONEY'S ON THE CHIEF
GOING FIRST.
HEY, WHAT'D I MISS?

11:23.300 --> 11:25.767
ANY CARDIOTHORACIC CONCERNS?
I'D BE HAPPY TO PAGE DR. HAHN.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.767
SCAN'S COMING UP.
(Miranda) HERE IT IS.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.833
WAIT FOR IT.
(machine beeps)

11:29.867 --> 11:32.767
W-WAIT.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.033
WAIT.
(Meredith) OH, THAT CAN'T
BE RIGHT, CAN IT?

11:35.067 --> 11:37.100
I'M NOT SEEING ANY FREE FLUID,

11:37.133 --> 11:39.533
ANY INTRAPERITONEAL GASES.

11:39.567 --> 11:42.733
DOES ANYBODY SEE ANYTHING?
THERE! RIGHT THERE.
A HEMATOMA.

11:42.767 --> 11:45.667
(Cristina) IN THE RIGHT
LOWER QUADRANT.
IT'S THE APPENDIX.

11:45.700 --> 11:49.367
W-WE'RE SAYING THIS GUY
FELL 12,000 FEET,

11:49.400 --> 11:53.667
AND BASICALLY ALL HE NEEDS
IS AN APPENDECTOMY?

11:53.700 --> 11:55.300
(sighs)

12:02.633 --> 12:05.633
YOU'RE CHARTING...
IN A CLOSET.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.600
I GET A LOT OF WORK DONE
IN HERE.

12:07.633 --> 12:10.133
IT'S QUIET AND NICE.
AND A CLOSET.

12:10.167 --> 12:12.200
LOOK...

12:12.233 --> 12:14.400
WHEN I'M OUT THERE
ROAMING THE FLOORS,

12:14.433 --> 12:16.200
OKAY, I AM THE OTHER GREY

12:16.233 --> 12:18.667
THAT DR. YANG LIKES
TO HUMILIATE AND KICK AROUND.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.267
AND--AND IN HERE,
I'M--I'M NOT.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.500
YOU KNOW, IN--IN HERE, I'M--
IT'S JUST--

12:23.533 --> 12:25.433
IT'S--IT'S MY PLACE, OKAY?

12:25.467 --> 12:28.033
IT'S--IT'S A CLOSET.

12:28.067 --> 12:31.167
YOU KNOW, EVERY INTERN CLASS
HAS ITS RUNT OF THE LITTER.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.100
YOU KEEP THIS UP, THIS YEAR
IT'S GONNA BE YOU.

12:34.133 --> 12:36.167
GET UP.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.500
OH, SORRY. YOU PROBABLY NEED
TO GET IN HERE.

12:38.533 --> 12:41.400
NO, GRAB--GRAB A SLING
FROM THE BOX AND COME WITH ME.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.567
WITH YOU?
WELL, IF YOU'D RATHER SIT

12:43.600 --> 12:45.733
LIKE A LOSER IN A CLOSET
DOING CHARTS, YOU CAN.

12:45.767 --> 12:50.400
OR YOU CAN COME HELP ME
ON ORTHO TODAY. YOUR CHOICE.

12:50.433 --> 12:52.833
NO WAY. NO FRICKIN' WAY.
(Callie)
IT'S THE ONLY SOLUTION

12:52.867 --> 12:55.767
IF NEITHER OF YOU
WILL LET GO OF THE DRESS.
(Mark) IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.333
DR. TORRES NEEDS TO TREAT
JACKIE'S SHOULDER AND LEG,

12:59.367 --> 13:01.533
SO, JACKIE, YOU NEED A PROXY.
WHAT?

13:01.567 --> 13:03.400
THINK ABOUT IT, BABE.
THIS GIVES YOU AN ADVANTAGE.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.133
YOU GET TO REST YOUR HAND
AND COME BACK REFRESHED.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.733
GIVE ME THE DRESS.
I'LL BE THE PROXY.

13:07.767 --> 13:11.233
NO WAY. UNH-UNH. THIS ISN'T
FAIR. YOU THINK THIS IS FAIR?

13:11.267 --> 13:14.400
DR. O'MALLEY'S THE PROXY.

13:14.433 --> 13:15.500
WHAT?

13:15.533 --> 13:18.267
HE'LL HOLD ON TO THE DRESS.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.467
HOLD THE DRESS?

13:19.500 --> 13:21.333
YOU JUST WANT ME TO...

13:21.367 --> 13:23.267
STAND HERE
AND HOLD A DRESS?

13:23.300 --> 13:27.200
NO ONE EVERY SAID
INTERNSHIP WAS EASY.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.067
DUDE, YOU'RE JOB
KINDA SUCKS, HUH?

13:39.100 --> 13:42.633
OH! HELLO?
WATCH THE SHOULDER.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.500
OH, CHECK IT OUT.
BAMBI'S A BRIDESMAID.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.833
(Alex laughs)

13:46.867 --> 13:49.600
YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS DID
CHEER ME UP. (chuckles)

13:51.167 --> 13:52.767
YOU'VE GOT NO LUNG INJURIES,

13:52.800 --> 13:54.700
NO SPINAL INJURIES,
NO BROKEN BONES.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.567
YOU'RE JUST A LUCKY MAN.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.133
HOLY CRAP.
THE ONLY THING WE FOUND

13:59.167 --> 14:01.433
WAS A LITTLE BLEEDING
IN YOUR LOWER ABDOMEN.

14:01.467 --> 14:04.367
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO
REMOVE YOUR APPENDIX.
HOW'S THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.300
UH, THE BODY'S
AN AMAZING THING.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.667
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES THESE THINGS,

14:07.700 --> 14:09.167
THEY JUST HAPPEN.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.567
YEAH.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.833
IF YOU HAD DIED...

14:13.867 --> 14:15.067
GOD.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.433
I DIDN'T THOUGH.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.667
I LIVED. (laughs)

14:18.700 --> 14:20.533
IT'S JUST
THE MOST AMAZING FEELING.

14:20.567 --> 14:23.433
I FEEL LIKE I COULD
DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.367
I MEAN, ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

14:25.400 --> 14:27.700
BECAUSE I FACED DEATH AND I...
I SURVIVED.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.467
IT CHANGES A PERSON.

14:29.500 --> 14:34.100
IT DOES. IT SO DOES.

14:34.133 --> 14:36.233
SALLY...

14:36.267 --> 14:39.400
SAL, I HAVE TO--
I WANT TO, UM--

14:39.433 --> 14:42.067
DON'T WORRY. THE MINUTE--
THE MINUTE WE GET OUT OF HERE,

14:42.100 --> 14:43.700
I AM SO DESTROYING
THAT VIDEO.

14:43.733 --> 14:47.500
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO--
TO RELIVE THAT HORRIBLE--

14:47.533 --> 14:49.667
IN FACT,
WHERE'S YOUR HELMET?

14:49.700 --> 14:51.600
I'M GONNA DESTROY THAT VIDEO
RIGHT NOW.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.300
SALLY. SAL...

14:53.333 --> 14:55.667
WAIT.
DID SHE SAY "VIDEO"?

14:55.700 --> 14:58.300
(Erica) THE TRICK
IS TO ENVISION THE ARTERY

14:58.333 --> 15:00.067
LIKE A SPAGHETTI NOODLE--

15:00.100 --> 15:01.833
PLIABLE,
BUT NOT TOO FRAGILE.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.433
GOOD MORNING.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.367
OH, THIS IS
AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE, CHIEF.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.567
YOU NEED SOMETHING?

15:06.600 --> 15:09.633
OH, FIRST DAY. JUST WANTED
TO SEE HOW YOU WERE SETTLING IN.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.200
(machine beeps)

15:11.233 --> 15:12.533
YOU SEE THAT?

15:12.567 --> 15:14.333
IT'S A BLOCKAGE,

15:14.367 --> 15:16.067
LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.433
IT'S TOTALLY CLOSED OFF.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.467
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GETTING
A STENT IN THERE.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.433
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
OPEN HIM UP.
(Izzie) B.P.'s DROPPING
TO 58 OVER 20.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.100
HIS HEART'S RACING.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.367
AND HIS TEMP'S RISING.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.767
MUSCLES ARE RIGID. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BRING HIM OFF ANESTHESIA

15:27.800 --> 15:30.400
AND START HIM ON 100% O-2.

15:30.433 --> 15:31.767
HE'S GOT
MALIGNANT HYPOTHERMIA.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.600
SO HE'S ALLERGIC
TO THE ANESTHESIA?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.533
HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO ENDURE THE CABG.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.100
SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS?

15:38.133 --> 15:40.800
(monitor beeps erratically)

15:42.467 --> 15:44.600
THAT'S JUST, UH...

15:44.633 --> 15:48.733
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE TELLING ME...

15:50.800 --> 15:53.667
(voice breaks) YOU'RE NOT
ACTUALLY TELLING ME I'M...

15:53.700 --> 15:55.567
I'M GONNA DIE?

15:55.600 --> 15:58.033
THE BLOCKAGE WE FOUND
IN YOUR HEART NEEDS SURGERY,

15:58.067 --> 16:00.433
EXTENSIVE SURGERY.

16:00.467 --> 16:01.467
(Erica)
ANGIOPLASTY WON'T WORK.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.300
AND SINCE YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO THE ANESTHESIA...

16:05.333 --> 16:08.333
SO I'LL JUST, UH...

16:10.067 --> 16:12.833
I'LL BE LIKE THIS.

16:12.867 --> 16:15.400
I'LL BE SICK...

16:15.433 --> 16:18.167
AND EXHAUSTED...

16:18.200 --> 16:21.167
AND LIKE THIS...

16:21.200 --> 16:23.467
UNTIL ONE DAY WHEN I'LL...

16:23.500 --> 16:27.167
JUST, UH... DIE.

16:32.633 --> 16:35.433
IT WOULD'VE BEEN WONDERFUL...

16:35.467 --> 16:37.467
TO SEE THAT BIRD.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.700
IT WOULD'VE BEEN WONDERFUL.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.800
(Mark) YOU'RE CROWDING ME,
O'MALLEY.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.700
HEY, HEY,
I THINK HE JUST LET GO.

16:54.733 --> 16:57.467
YOU JUST LET GO
OF THE DRESS, DIDN'T YOU?
NO.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.733
I WISH TO GOD HE HAD.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.567
I SWEAR, IF YOU LET GO
AND LOSE THIS CONTEST

17:01.600 --> 17:05.300
AFTER MY JACKIE ALMOST DIED
TO WIN IT--

17:05.333 --> 17:08.233
DUDE, A BUSTED SHOULDER
DOES NOT MEAN SHE ALMOST DIED.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.100
OKAY?
WHATEVER.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.233
I'M WATCHING YOU.

17:12.267 --> 17:15.133
I KNOW YOU ALL THINK
THIS IS STUPID.

17:15.167 --> 17:17.700
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD THINK
THIS IS REALLY STUPID.

17:17.733 --> 17:20.467
WELL, I'VE NEVER
BEEN MARRIED MYSELF,

17:20.500 --> 17:22.400
SO I'M NOT ONE TO JUDGE,

17:22.433 --> 17:24.500
BUT GEORGE HERE KNOWS
ALL ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES.

17:24.533 --> 17:25.633
DON'T YOU, O'MALLEY?

17:25.667 --> 17:28.233
YOU'RE MARRIED?
FOR HOW LONG?

17:28.267 --> 17:29.333
NOT VERY LONG.

17:29.367 --> 17:32.267
NEWLYWEDS? CONGRATULATIONS.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.100
***

17:34.133 --> 17:35.267
THANKS.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.167
NOW, JACKIE,
DR. KAREV AND I

17:37.200 --> 17:39.167
ARE GONNA DO THIS
ON THE COUNT OF THREE, OKAY?

17:39.200 --> 17:41.667
I SHOULD TOTALLY WIN
OVER THAT HELENA GIRL.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.100
I'M AM WAY MORE INJURED
THAN SHE IS.

17:44.133 --> 17:46.133
I SHOULD JUST WIN BY DEFAULT.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.800
ONE... TWO...

17:47.833 --> 17:49.600
(whimpers)
THREE.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.167
(crack)
OW!

17:52.200 --> 17:54.300
IS IT IN?

17:54.333 --> 17:57.133
(crack)
OW!

17:57.167 --> 17:59.300
OOH. IT POPPED BACK OUT.
SHE'S GONNA NEED SURGERY.

17:59.333 --> 18:02.200
WHOA. HEY, NO.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO MY DRESS.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.233
JUST WRAP SOME BANDAGES
AROUND IT OR SOMETHING.

18:04.267 --> 18:06.200
YOU WOULD RATHER
HOLD ON TO A DRESS

18:06.233 --> 18:08.767
WITH A DISLOCATED SHOULDER
THAN LET ME REPAIR IT

18:08.800 --> 18:11.667
IN SURGERY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW?
I CAN HAVE SURGERY ANYTIME.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.800
I CAN ONLY WIN
THIS WEDDING ONCE.

18:13.833 --> 18:17.033
***

18:24.167 --> 18:26.067
SO WHAT,
HE JUST STANDS THERE

18:26.100 --> 18:27.600
AND HOLDS A DRESS?

18:27.633 --> 18:30.767
I KNOW. I THOUGHT IT WAS
GONNA BE MORE EXCITING, TOO.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.833
A MONKEY COULD HOLD
A DRESS.

18:32.867 --> 18:35.033
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

18:35.067 --> 18:36.600
(Helena) DON'T LET THEM
GET TO YOU.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.467
TUNE THEM OUT, ALL OF THEM.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.400
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THROUGH IT.

18:40.433 --> 18:43.467
SWEETIE, HE'S YOUR COMPETITION.
DON'T HELP HIM.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.533
YOU EVER GIVE MORPHINE
TO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T PATIENTS?

18:45.567 --> 18:47.833
THIS KINDA BLOWS.
IT'S MORE FUN
WHEN YOU HECKLE.

18:47.867 --> 18:51.200
DON'T HECKLE, GEORGE.
YEAH, WHATEVER. I GOT SOMETHING
WAY BETTER THAN THIS.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.400
SOMETHING THAT TOPS
O'MALLEY PLAYING BRIDE?

18:55.167 --> 18:58.200
SKYDIVER VIDEO.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.433
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

19:04.467 --> 19:07.100
VIDEO FROM THE HELMET
OF A SKYDIVER WITHOUT A CHUTE.

19:07.133 --> 19:10.133
YOU GUYS ARE SICK.
OH, IT'S NOT A SNUFF FILM.
THE GUY SURVIVES.

19:10.167 --> 19:11.700
(Alex) HOLY...

19:11.733 --> 19:12.733
OH.

19:12.767 --> 19:13.633
WOW.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.067
OH, IS HE...
OH, NO, HE'S GOING FOR IT.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.733
HE'S GOING FOR THE CHUTE.
OH, AND IT DOESN'T OPEN.
NOW HE'S FLAILING.

19:18.767 --> 19:20.800
HE'S GOING FOR
HIS SECOND CHUTE.
(Izzie) OH, JEEZ.

19:20.833 --> 19:23.067
OH, ALSO DOESN'T OPEN.
YOU'D THINK THERE'D BE
MORE SCREAMING.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.633
OH, LOOK HOW CLOSE
THE GROUND IS GETTING.
WH-WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?

19:25.667 --> 19:28.700
PEEING HIS PANTS.
IS HE SAYING SOMETHING?
TURN IT UP.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.233
(Rick) THIS IS IT.
I SHOULD'VE JUST TOLD YOU.

19:31.267 --> 19:33.567
GOD, I WISH WOULD'VE TOLD YOU.
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.467
I-I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, SALLY.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.167
I--OHH!
(thud)

19:37.200 --> 19:38.600
(Cristina, Meredith and Izzie)
OH.
OH. (laughs)

19:38.633 --> 19:40.833
(Izzie) WHO'S SALLY?

19:40.867 --> 19:43.733
HIS SKYDIVING INSTRUCTOR.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.367
SAD.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
DOING HERE?

19:46.400 --> 19:49.567
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN SURGERY?
THE GUY IS ALLERGIC
TO ANESTHESIA.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.433
THE SURGERY WAS CANCELED.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.667
(Meredith) I DROWNED.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.133
I WAS SINKING...

19:57.167 --> 20:00.200
I DIED.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.567
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I REALIZED?

20:02.600 --> 20:06.067
I REALIZED HOW STUPID
ALL OF MY ISSUES ARE.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.733
I'M WAITING FOR HOW THIS
APPLIES TO ME.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.300
IT DOESN'T.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.567
OF COURSE NOT.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.767
WELL, THAT MAN FELL,

20:13.800 --> 20:15.700
AND ALL HE WANTED
WAS ONE LAST CHANCE

20:15.733 --> 20:18.100
TO TELL SALLY
HOW HE FELT ABOUT HER.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.100
AND I GOT ONE LAST CHANCE.

20:20.133 --> 20:21.333
I GOT MY CHANCE.

20:21.367 --> 20:23.267
AND WHAT
HAVE I DONE WITH IT?

20:23.300 --> 20:25.600
YOU KNOW, BEING AWARE
OF YOUR CRAP

20:25.633 --> 20:27.533
AND ACTUALLY
OVERCOMING YOUR CRAP

20:27.567 --> 20:29.500
ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.

20:29.533 --> 20:31.433
***

20:31.467 --> 20:33.033
I KNOW.

20:33.067 --> 20:34.800
HA! OKAY, FOUND IT.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.767
(printer whirs)

20:37.800 --> 20:40.367
DR. HAHN, I KNOW
HOW YOU CAN DO THE SURGERY

20:40.400 --> 20:42.367
ON THE PATIENT WHO IS
ALLERGIC TO ANESTHESIA.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.300
WELL, NO ANESTHESIA
MEANS NO VENTILATOR.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.367
NO VENTILATOR
MEANS NO CABG.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.033
NOT A WHOLE LOT
OF WIGGLE ROOM THERE.
YOU CAN OPERATE ON HIM
WHILE HE'S AWAKE.

20:50.067 --> 20:52.067
YANG--
YOU CAN USE
A HIGH THORACIC EPIDURAL

20:52.100 --> 20:53.833
TO NUMB HIM
FROM THE CHEST DOWN.

20:53.867 --> 20:56.167
LET HIM BREATHE ON HIS OWN
THE ENTIRE TIME.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.100
I MEAN, THEY PULLED IT OFF
IN INDIA LAST MONTH,

20:59.133 --> 21:01.467
AND THEN AGAIN IN--
DR. HAHN,
YOU WANTED TO SIGN

21:01.500 --> 21:03.400
THE DISCHARGE PAPERS
FOR MR. ARNOLD?

21:03.433 --> 21:04.600
NOT QUITE YET.

21:04.633 --> 21:07.600
WIDE AWAKE?

21:07.633 --> 21:11.033
YOU WANT ME TO LET YOU

21:11.067 --> 21:13.700
SLICE OPEN MY CHEST
WHILE I'M WIDE AWAKE?

21:13.733 --> 21:16.267
IT IS YOUR BEST OPTION.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.200
***

21:18.233 --> 21:23.267
UH, HOW... HOW LONG WOULD I
HAVE TO BE LYING THERE, UH,

21:23.300 --> 21:26.767
ON THE TABLE WITH MY CHEST OPEN,
UH, LIKE THAT?

21:26.800 --> 21:29.667
(Erica) THE SURGERY CAN TAKE
UP TO FIVE OR SIX HOURS.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.533
MAYBE MORE.

21:31.567 --> 21:32.500
(sighs)

21:32.533 --> 21:34.167
UH, SIX HOURS...

21:34.200 --> 21:37.133
AWAKE... W-WITH YOU
OPERATING ON MY HEART.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.367
I...

21:38.400 --> 21:40.733
THE IVORY-BILLED
WOODPECKER.
WHAT?

21:40.767 --> 21:41.833
WHAT?

21:41.867 --> 21:43.533
THE IVORY-BILLED
WOODPECKER.

21:43.567 --> 21:46.833
MR. ARNOLD, YOU WANT TO LIVE
TO SEE IT, DON'T YOU?

21:46.867 --> 21:49.367
THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.567
***

21:51.600 --> 21:54.467
IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.767
EXCELLENT.

21:56.800 --> 22:00.233
STEVENS, WE WILL SCRUB IN
AS SOON AS AN O.R. IS FREE.

22:00.267 --> 22:02.167
UH, BUT THE SURGERY
WAS CRISTINA'S IDEA.

22:02.200 --> 22:05.067
EITHER YOU WANT IN
OR YOU DON'T. WHICH IS IT?
I DO.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.667
UH, BUT--
I'M SURE THERE'LL BE
STANDING ROOM

22:07.700 --> 22:09.733
IN THE GALLERY, YANG.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.400
STEVENS, BOOK THE O.R.

22:11.433 --> 22:14.433
***

22:20.133 --> 22:22.600
(Derek) UH, CHIEF.
AWAKE OPEN-HEART SURGERY?

22:22.633 --> 22:25.400
YEAH. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT TONIGHT.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.300
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS
AWAKE OPEN-HEART SURGERY?

22:27.333 --> 22:30.200
MM-HMM. I'VE INVITED SLOAN
AND, UM, WELL, I'M WONDERING

22:30.233 --> 22:32.167
WHAT I SHOULD TELL HIM
TO EXPECT.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.467
MM, TELL HIM TO EXPECT
A GOOD TIME.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.133
OKAY, SO WHAT IS THAT,
POKER, CIGARS, WHISKEY?

22:37.167 --> 22:40.233
I MEAN,
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

22:40.267 --> 22:43.133
A GOOD TIME, SHEP.

22:43.167 --> 22:45.533
YOU KNOW?

22:45.567 --> 22:49.200
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE KIND OF STAMINA IT TAKES

22:49.233 --> 22:51.200
TO STAND IN A DISPLAY WINDOW

22:51.233 --> 22:52.533
FOR TWO DAYS.

22:52.567 --> 22:55.200
IT'S THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE,

22:55.233 --> 22:56.700
LIKE, EVER.

22:56.733 --> 22:59.100
YOU'RE RISKING PERMANENT DAMAGE
TO YOUR SHOULDER

22:59.133 --> 23:01.833
OVER A CONTEST.

23:01.867 --> 23:04.467
WHAT DOES YOUR DRESS
LOOK LIKE?

23:04.500 --> 23:07.067
STRAPLESS,
SWEETHEART NECKLINE,

23:07.100 --> 23:08.567
CRYSTAL BEADING--

23:08.600 --> 23:10.667
SO PRETTY.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.800
BUT YOU'RE GONNA WEAR
YOUR HAIR DOWN, THOUGH, RIGHT?

23:12.833 --> 23:15.500
YOU KNOW,
TO COVER THE HUNCHBACK?
THE WHAT?

23:15.533 --> 23:18.167
OH, IT'S JUST, SINCE YOU'RE
IGNORING DR. TORRES' ADVICE

23:18.200 --> 23:20.467
ABOUT GETTING THE SURGERY,
YOU KNOW,

23:20.500 --> 23:22.400
YOUR SHOULDER IS PROBABLY
GONNA BE PRETTY SWOLLEN

23:22.433 --> 23:25.833
AND PURPLE--YOU KNOW,
KIND OF LIKE A HUNCHBACK?

23:25.867 --> 23:28.233
BUT YOUR HAIR
SHOULD TOTALLY COVER IT.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.800
I MEAN, PROBABLY,
WITH THE RIGHT VEIL.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

23:30.833 --> 23:34.533
HOW SOON
CAN WE HAVE THE SURGERY?

23:35.767 --> 23:38.300
(Mark) DR. HAHN.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.467
I HEARD A CRAZY RUMOR
ABOUT YOU.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.333
THAT I'M PERFORMING
OPEN-HEART SURGERY

23:42.367 --> 23:44.267
ON A MAN WHO'S WIDE AWAKE?
THAT'S THE RUMOR.

23:44.300 --> 23:47.067
THAT'S THE TRUTH.
WELL, I PERFORM AWAKE
BRAIN SURGERY ALL THE TIME.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.833
NOT THE SAME THING.
NOT THE SAME THING.

23:48.867 --> 23:50.000
OH.

23:50.033 --> 23:52.733
YOU EVER HEARD
OF A GENTLEMEN'S EVENING?
I'M SORRY?

23:52.767 --> 23:55.533
THE CHIEF IS HOSTING
A GENTLEMEN'S EVENING.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.633
WE'RE PRETTY SURE
IT DOESN'T INVOLVE PORN,

23:57.667 --> 24:01.167
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE WANT TO BE SURE.
MM. RIGHT.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.500
ARE YOU TWO A COUPLE?

24:03.533 --> 24:05.200
(laughs) THAT'S--
(laughs)

24:05.233 --> 24:07.033
NO.
NO.

24:07.067 --> 24:09.233
JUST CHECKING.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.700
WHY WOULD SHE ASK THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

24:14.733 --> 24:16.633
I'M--I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THIS GENTLEMEN'S THING.

24:16.667 --> 24:20.533
GEORGE...
YOU GOT A SECOND?

24:20.567 --> 24:22.433
SERIOUSLY?

24:22.467 --> 24:23.400
(chuckles)

24:23.433 --> 24:26.033
ONE SEC.
(clears throat)

24:29.467 --> 24:31.400
HI.
HI.

24:31.433 --> 24:34.267
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUSH BACK
OUR PERFECT EVENING TONIGHT.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.033
NOT BY MUCH--
A FEW HOURS, I THINK.

24:37.067 --> 24:38.567
SURE. OKAY.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.700
OKAY.

24:39.733 --> 24:42.567
I'M ABOUT TO SCRUB IN
ON AN AWAKE OPEN-HEART SURGERY.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.833
A WHAT?

24:43.867 --> 24:45.767
AWAKE. THE PATIENT'S
GONNA BE WIDE AWAKE

24:45.800 --> 24:47.700
WHILE WE OPERATE
ON HIS HEART.
THAT IS INTENSE.

24:47.733 --> 24:49.633
IT IS. IT IS INTENSE.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.700
IT'S... UH...

24:51.733 --> 24:54.600
YOU KNOW, CRISTINA
WOULD BE ALL OVER THIS.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.533
SHE WOULD BE STUDYING
AND QUIZZING HERSELF,

24:56.567 --> 24:59.433
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS--IS THE POOR GUY.

24:59.467 --> 25:02.167
YOU KNOW,
HE'S REALLY NERVOUS ALREADY,

25:02.200 --> 25:04.467
AND... I'M NOT HARD-CORE.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.400
I'M NOT HARD-CORE ENOUGH
FOR THIS.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.100
YES, YOU ARE.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.833
WHAT, YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE JUST NOT LIKE CRISTINA.

25:10.867 --> 25:13.567
YOU'RE HARD-CORE.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.133
YOU'RE HARD-CORE LIKE IZZIE.

25:16.167 --> 25:17.200
(chuckles)

25:17.233 --> 25:19.133
DID THAT JUST SOUND DIRTY?

25:19.167 --> 25:21.433
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT
HOW I MEANT IT.
MM.

25:21.467 --> 25:23.600
MEAN IT, MAN.
SHUT--

25:23.633 --> 25:25.767
(laughs)

25:25.800 --> 25:28.633
GO KICK ASS IN THE SURGERY,
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE OUR NIGHT,

25:28.667 --> 25:30.600
AND IT WILL BE PERFECT.
OH, I HAVE NOT
SHAVED MY LEGS YET.

25:30.633 --> 25:32.567
GO BE HARD-CORE IZZIE.
GO.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.500
OKAY, GOT IT. GOING.
GO.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.800
THANK YOU.
BYE.

25:38.367 --> 25:40.200
SHE'S HOT, MAN.

25:40.233 --> 25:42.567
UH--
IS SHE YOUR WIFE?

25:42.600 --> 25:47.333
I DON'T KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

25:47.367 --> 25:50.133
CHIEF, YOU PAGED?

25:50.167 --> 25:52.567
CLOSE THE DOOR.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.633
YOU HAD THE NERVE
TO TELL A PATIENT

25:54.667 --> 25:57.367
YOU WOULD PERFORM
AWAKE OPEN-HEART SURGERY

25:57.400 --> 25:59.533
WITHOUT RUNNING IT
PAST ME?

25:59.567 --> 26:01.567
DID BURKE RUN EVERY SURGERY
PAST YOU?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.400
ERICA, I KNOW
YOU'RE NEW HERE...
NO.

26:03.433 --> 26:06.533
BUT WE RUN--
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE RULES ARE.

26:06.567 --> 26:09.167
EVERY SURGERY BURKE BOOKED,
HE RAN IT UP THE FLAGPOLE FIRST?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.667
AND WHAT ABOUT PRETTY
AND PRETTIER?

26:11.700 --> 26:14.300
THEY RUN ALL THEIR SURGERIES
PAST YOU?
WAIT, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
SHEPHERD AND SLOAN?

26:14.333 --> 26:16.233
I AM TALKING ABOUT
YOUR MALE ATTENDINGS.

26:16.267 --> 26:19.700
YOU KNOW, THE ONES YOU INVITED
TO YOUR GENTLEMEN'S EVENING?

26:19.733 --> 26:21.667
GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW A GUY
TILL YOU WORK FOR HIM.

26:21.700 --> 26:24.467
I MEAN,
WHO KNEW YOU WERE RUNNING

26:24.500 --> 26:26.400
SOME KIND OF OLD BOYS' CLUB?
NO, THAT IS NOT IT.
WHAT WE WERE--

26:26.433 --> 26:28.600
YOU REALIZE THAT AN EVENING
TO WHICH

26:28.633 --> 26:30.800
THE MALE ATTENDINGS ARE INVITED
AND THE WOMEN ARE NOT--

26:30.833 --> 26:33.333
YOU REALIZE THAT THAT'S
A LOT LIKE WHEN LAW FIRMS

26:33.367 --> 26:35.267
USED TO HAVE
COUNTRY CLUB WEEKENDS

26:35.300 --> 26:37.767
AND FAILED TO INVITE
THE BLACK ASSOCIATES?

26:37.800 --> 26:42.367
GOOD TALK.
I GOTTA PREP FOR MY SURGERY.

26:49.767 --> 26:52.467
(Meredith)
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS DEAD?

26:52.500 --> 26:55.200
BEFORE I WENT
IN THAT WATER,

26:55.233 --> 27:01.100
EVERYTHING WAS SO...
COMPLICATED AND HARD.

27:01.133 --> 27:05.800
AND THEN YOU PULLED ME
OUT OF THE WATER.

27:05.833 --> 27:10.267
AND I CAME BACK TO LIFE.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.333
FOR A MOMENT,
EVERYTHING WAS SO CLEAR...

27:15.100 --> 27:18.533
AS IF THE WATER HAD
WASHED EVERYTHING CLEAN.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.267
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

27:22.300 --> 27:24.400
I DO.

27:28.533 --> 27:31.100
ME, TOO.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.533
***

28:24.400 --> 28:26.533
***

28:26.567 --> 28:27.600
(sighs)

28:27.633 --> 28:30.533
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS
DID THIS FOR TWO DAYS.

28:30.567 --> 28:33.167
BELIEVE ME, I WOULD BE
AT CITY HALL TOMORROW

28:33.200 --> 28:34.433
IF THAT WERE AN OPTION.

28:34.467 --> 28:36.133
IT IS AN OPTION.

28:36.167 --> 28:38.800
YOU COULD JUST...
LET GO.

28:38.833 --> 28:40.800
YOU LET GO.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.767
***

28:42.800 --> 28:45.433
YOU LET GO,
AND IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

28:45.467 --> 28:46.533
IT'S A WEDDING.

28:46.567 --> 28:49.567
I LET GO, AND I HAVE TO
FACE THE WRATH OF DR. SLOAN.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.500
***

28:51.533 --> 28:53.600
MY MOM MANAGES
A GROCERY STORE,

28:53.633 --> 28:56.233
AND EVER SINCE
I GOT ENGAGED,

28:56.267 --> 28:59.233
SHE'S BEEN PUTTING HERSELF
INTO SERIOUS DEBT

28:59.267 --> 29:00.833
OVER HAND-ENGRAVED
PLACE CARDS

29:00.867 --> 29:03.800
AND CHOCOLATE FOUNTAINS.

29:03.833 --> 29:06.800
IT'S HER DREAM.

29:06.833 --> 29:09.267
MY WEDDING IS HER DREAM.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.767
***

29:10.800 --> 29:12.700
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO HER.

29:12.733 --> 29:14.633
THIS IS WHAT
SHE'S BEEN LIVING FOR

29:14.667 --> 29:16.300
SINCE I CAN REMEMBER,

29:16.333 --> 29:18.600
SINCE... MY DAD LEFT.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.533
***

29:20.567 --> 29:23.800
MY PERFECT NIGHT.

29:23.833 --> 29:27.767
SO... I CAN DO THIS.

29:27.800 --> 29:31.067
I CAN DO THIS FOR HER...

29:31.100 --> 29:34.533
BECAUSE SHE'S DONE
A LOT FOR ME.

29:34.567 --> 29:37.433
***

29:37.467 --> 29:39.400
WHOA.

29:39.433 --> 29:41.267
***

29:41.300 --> 29:44.133
GET ME A CRASH CART
RIGHT NOW.

29:44.167 --> 29:46.167
***

29:47.733 --> 29:50.267
MUST HAVE HAPPENED
WHEN SHE FELL THIS MORNING,

29:50.300 --> 29:52.833
WHICH MEANS SHE WAS BLEEDING
ALL DAY.

29:52.867 --> 29:54.233
SHE SEEMED JUST FINE.

29:54.267 --> 29:56.633
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN FEELING
SOME MAJOR PAIN.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.100
YEAH, HOLDING ON TO THAT DRESS,
THAT WASN'T EASY FOR HER.

29:59.133 --> 30:00.800
IT WAS HUMILIATING. IT WAS--

30:00.833 --> 30:03.600
BUT WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING TO
BREAK YOU,

30:03.633 --> 30:05.533
IT GIVES YOU DRIVE,
GIVES YOU STRENGTH.

30:05.567 --> 30:08.033
HOLDING ON TO THAT DRESS
FOR HOURS--I MEAN, DAYS--

30:08.067 --> 30:09.467
YOU KNOW, JUST...

30:09.500 --> 30:12.233
AND IN PUBLIC,
REFUSING TO BUCKLE,

30:12.267 --> 30:14.167
REFUSING TO BEG--
THAT'S HARD-CORE.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.167
I MEAN, IN ITS OWN WAY,
THAT'S SERIOUSLY HARD-CORE.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.700
RUMOR HAS IT THAT SLOAN
WAS BUSY HAZING

30:20.733 --> 30:23.167
ONE OF HIS INTERNS TODAY.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.700
I TAKE IT
YOU DIDN'T BUCKLE.

30:25.733 --> 30:29.667
***

30:29.700 --> 30:32.300
NO, SIR.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.433
GOOD MAN, O'MALLEY.

30:34.467 --> 30:36.500
***

30:36.533 --> 30:39.533
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:48.867 --> 30:51.600
***

30:51.633 --> 30:55.633
UH, I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING
FROM THE NECK DOWN.

30:55.667 --> 30:58.367
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
THE REST OF ME JUST...

30:58.400 --> 31:00.533
DOESN'T EXIST.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.267
***

31:03.300 --> 31:05.500
OKAY, THE SOUND YOU'RE
ABOUT TO HEAR, THAT'S THE SAW.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.133
(whirring)

31:07.167 --> 31:09.100
THAT--THAT'S NOT
A PRETTY SOUND.

31:09.133 --> 31:11.033
I BROUGHT YOU SOME MUSIC.

31:11.067 --> 31:13.200
JUST LISTEN TO THIS
AND TUNE IT ALL OUT.

31:13.233 --> 31:15.433
***

31:15.467 --> 31:17.500
(loudly)
AND--AND--AND THAT SMELL.

31:17.533 --> 31:20.500
THAT--THAT SMELL IS NOT--
THAT'S THE CAUTERY.

31:20.533 --> 31:23.233
I-I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

31:23.267 --> 31:26.267
IN A MOMENT OR TWO, YOU WON'T
EVEN NOTICE IT. I PROMISE.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.200
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:28.233 --> 31:31.100
(saw whirring)

31:31.133 --> 31:34.100
***

31:34.133 --> 31:36.567
HE JUMPED OUT OF THAT PLANE.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.500
NO ONE FORCED HIM
TO DO IT.

31:38.533 --> 31:40.600
FELL 12,000 FEET.

31:40.633 --> 31:43.333
PEOPLE CHASING DEATH DOWN,

31:43.367 --> 31:44.567
THEN TRYING TO CHEAT IT.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.767
DOESN'T MAKE
ANY KIND OF SENSE TO ME.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.133
THERE'S A CLARITY THING.

31:49.167 --> 31:51.100
WHEN YOU CROSS OVER THE EDGE,

31:51.133 --> 31:53.300
THERE'S A MOMENT
WHEN EVERYTHING...

31:53.333 --> 31:55.033
JUST MELTS AWAY,

31:55.067 --> 31:57.833
AND YOU'RE FEARLESS.

31:57.867 --> 31:59.800
I GET IT.

31:59.833 --> 32:03.800
I UNDERSTAND
WANTING TO FEEL LIKE THAT.

32:03.833 --> 32:07.000
***

32:08.600 --> 32:11.200
OH, HEY. HI THERE.
YOU'RE AWAKE.

32:11.233 --> 32:12.267
DID I WIN?

32:12.300 --> 32:15.300
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
YOUR SURGERY WENT VERY WELL.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.333
***

32:17.367 --> 32:19.767
BUT WHO WON?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.100
I-IS SHE STILL HOLDING ON?

32:22.133 --> 32:24.833
HELENA COLLAPSED.
SHE'S IN SURGERY.

32:24.867 --> 32:26.500
SO--SO I WON?

32:26.533 --> 32:30.700
SHE--SHE COLLAPSED, WHICH--
WHICH MEANS I WON, RIGHT?

32:30.733 --> 32:32.800
WHERE--WHERE'S THE JUDGE?

32:32.833 --> 32:35.367
YOU--THE WOMAN THAT YOU
STOOD NEXT TO FOR TWO DAYS

32:35.400 --> 32:37.067
ALMOST DIED.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.400
OKAY, YOU'VE JUST WOKEN UP
FROM SURGERY,

32:39.433 --> 32:42.300
AND ALL THAT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT
IS IF YOU WON A STUPID CONTEST?

32:42.333 --> 32:44.233
DON'T YOU GET IT?

32:44.267 --> 32:46.667
YOU--YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT
THIS HARD FOR A WEDDING.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.700
YOU FIGHT FOR A MARRIAGE,

32:48.733 --> 32:51.200
AND SOMETIMES
EVEN THAT IS A LOST CAUSE.

32:51.233 --> 32:53.567
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHEN TO LET GO.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.633
SO JUST LET GO ALREADY,
ALL RIGHT? JUST FRICKIN' LET GO.

32:56.667 --> 32:58.333
***

32:58.367 --> 33:01.267
YEAH, BUT...
D-DID I WIN?

33:01.300 --> 33:04.733

33:14.133 --> 33:15.800

33:18.067 --> 33:19.800
IZZIE STUCK A PICTURE
OF A BIRD

33:19.833 --> 33:22.700
ON AN EMPTY SALINE BAG
AND PUT IT IN HIS EYELINE.

33:22.733 --> 33:26.367
THAT'S SMART. I WOULDN'T
HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.300
YEAH.

33:27.333 --> 33:28.433
MM.

33:33.433 --> 33:36.767
(lowered voice) SHE DOESN'T
LET ME TAKE CARE OF HER.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.700
IT'S NOT MY JOB ANYMORE.

33:38.733 --> 33:42.033
SHE WON'T LET ME.

33:44.367 --> 33:46.667
I'M TAKING CARE OF HER.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.133
YOU'RE, UH...

33:53.167 --> 33:56.100
YOU'RE, UH,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT MY HEART?

33:56.133 --> 33:58.567

YOU'RE LOOKING AT MY...

33:58.600 --> 34:00.167
ACTUAL HEART?

34:00.200 --> 34:03.133
BETTER THAN THAT, MR. ARNOLD,
WE'RE FIXING IT.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.567

ALL THOSE PEOPLE, UH,

HOW YOU DOING THERE,
MR. ARNOLD?

34:34.800 --> 34:36.300

RIGHT NOW.
OH, C-COV-COVER ME UP.

I CAN'T STAY LIKE THIS.
YOU NEED--NEED--

35:08.267 --> 35:10.300
I-I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

35:10.333 --> 35:13.667
NO, STOP RIGHT NOW.
JUST--JUST STOP THE SURGERY.

35:13.700 --> 35:16.067
STOP! STOP! STOP IT!

35:18.167 --> 35:19.567
(Mr. Arnold) STOP! ST-STOP!

35:19.600 --> 35:22.433
OKAY, I-I MEAN IT.
GET YOUR HANDS OUT OF ME.

35:22.467 --> 35:23.500
PLEASE STOP!
(Erica) OKAY, OKAY.

35:23.533 --> 35:26.300
MR. ARNOLD,
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN

35:26.333 --> 35:28.433
SO THAT YOUR HEART
CAN CALM DOWN.

OKAY, HEY, MR. ARNOLD.
(Mr. Arnold) OH. AAH.

PRETEND THAT IT'S A TREE LINE
OR A SHORELINE

35:41.067 --> 35:42.800

HOW ABOUT HER? THAT WOMAN
IN--IN THE FAR LEFT?

35:55.733 --> 35:58.300
WHAT KIND OF BIRD

WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANYBODY
YOU WERE HURTING?

38:08.300 --> 38:11.400
YOU WOULD'VE MADE ME LET GO.

38:11.433 --> 38:13.167
HELL YEAH, I WOULD'VE.

38:35.067 --> 38:37.367
OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M CRYING OVER THIS.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.200
(laughs)

38:39.233 --> 38:40.433
WE DID THIS.

38:40.467 --> 38:41.767
WE ACTUALLY DID THIS.

38:41.800 --> 38:45.233
NO, SWEETIE,
YOU DID IT.

38:45.267 --> 38:48.067
THIS WAS ALL YOU.

38:53.133 --> 38:57.233
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS RIDICULOUS,
BUT I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.

38:57.267 --> 38:59.367
I MEAN, I SURVIVED
A 12,000-FOOT FREEFALL,

38:59.400 --> 39:01.300
AND THIS IS GONNA BE
MY ONLY SCAR?

39:01.333 --> 39:03.767
IT GOES AWAY.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.333
THE SCAR?

39:05.367 --> 39:08.300
THE FEELING.

39:08.333 --> 39:11.500
THAT FEELING THAT YOU HAVE
RIGHT NOW, TODAY,

39:11.533 --> 39:14.700
THAT FEELING
LIKE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,

39:14.733 --> 39:17.167
THAT CLARITY,

39:17.200 --> 39:18.800
IT GOES AWAY.

39:18.833 --> 39:21.233
AND YOU GO RIGHT BACK
TO BEING THE COWARD

39:21.267 --> 39:25.767
WHO CAN'T TELL THE PERSON
YOU LOVE HOW YOU FEEL.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.267
(lowered voice)
I SAW YOUR VIDEO.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.167
Y-YOU SAW THE...

39:31.200 --> 39:34.233
OH. OKAY.

39:34.267 --> 39:36.500
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET SALLY SEE IT, RIGHT?

39:36.533 --> 39:39.600
Y-YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET HER KNOW WHAT I SAID?

39:39.633 --> 39:41.567
(normal voice)
LIKE I SAID...

39:41.600 --> 39:43.467
IT GOES AWAY.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.033
IT'S GOING AWAY RIGHT NOW.

39:45.067 --> 39:47.433
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER
HOW YOU FEEL,

39:47.467 --> 39:49.767
RIGHT NOW
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.433
SHE IS JUST SO INCREDIBLE,

39:51.467 --> 39:53.733
I MEAN,
AT EVERYTHING SHE DOES.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.400
SHE'S WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:56.433 --> 39:58.833
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT SHE COULD POSSIBLY FEEL

39:58.867 --> 40:00.767
THE SAME WAY THAT--
WELL, IF SHE DOESN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY,

40:00.800 --> 40:02.433
THEN YOU MOVE ON.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.367
BUT IF YOU NEVER FIND OUT
HOW SHE FEELS,

40:05.400 --> 40:08.433
THEN THAT WON'T BE
YOUR ONLY SCAR.

40:08.467 --> 40:11.467
***

40:16.633 --> 40:20.033
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SECRET FETISHES, RIGHT?

40:20.067 --> 40:21.800
HE REALLY--
HE DOESN'T STRIKE ME

40:21.833 --> 40:24.767
AS A FETISH KIND OF GUY.
MM. HEY, RICHARD,

40:24.800 --> 40:27.067
YOU GOTTA TELL US
WHAT THIS EVENING IS ABOUT.

40:27.100 --> 40:29.633
YOU'VE BEEN OBTUSE,
IT'S BEEN FUN BUT, YOU KNOW,

40:29.667 --> 40:31.733
WE'RE GETTING
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT NOW.

40:31.767 --> 40:34.167
WHAT'S A GENTLEMEN'S EVENING?
IT'S AN EVENING
WITH NO LADIES,

40:34.200 --> 40:36.533
JUST GENTLEMEN.
THAT'S IT?

40:36.567 --> 40:38.333
WELL, YEAH.

40:38.367 --> 40:40.567
(Erica) PRETTY BOYS
LIVING IN THE WOODS.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.367
THIS IS VERY CHARMING.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.467
OR SAD.
I'M NOT SURE WHICH.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.467
WHAT HAPPENED TO NO LADIES?
YEAH.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.133
PLANS CHANGE.

40:49.167 --> 40:52.400
***

40:52.433 --> 40:55.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

40:55.300 --> 40:57.533
AS IN, UH...

40:57.567 --> 41:00.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TONIGHT?

41:00.400 --> 41:03.467
***

41:03.500 --> 41:06.367
LOOK, UH...
I'M NOT A NICE GUY.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.833
I DON'T DATE.
I DON'T CALL THE NEXT DAY.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.767
I--I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A RELATIONSHIP

41:10.800 --> 41:13.133
'CAUSE I'M NEVER GOOD
AT 'EM.

41:13.167 --> 41:15.700
AND HONESTLY, I'M KINDA
HUNG UP ON SOMEBODY ELSE.

41:15.733 --> 41:18.600
SO... THE ONLY THING YOU'RE
EVER GONNA GET FROM ME IS SEX.

41:18.633 --> 41:19.667
THAT'S IT.

41:19.700 --> 41:22.700
AND, UH, THAT'S NEVER ENOUGH
FOR GIRLS LIKE YOU.

41:22.733 --> 41:25.833
***

41:25.867 --> 41:27.367
DEEP DOWN,

41:27.400 --> 41:29.700
EVERYONE WANTS TO BELIEVE
THEY CAN BE HARD-CORE.

41:29.733 --> 41:31.633
BUT BEING HARD-CORE ISN'T JUST
ABOUT BEING TOUGH.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.167
OH, THIS IS JUST UNFAIR!

41:33.200 --> 41:35.367
IN YOUR FACE, BANKER.
PARK PLACE IS MINE.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.700
GIVE IT UP. COME ON.
(Richard groans)

41:37.733 --> 41:40.700
YEAH, OH, WITH A HOTEL!
(Richard) I THINK
YOU OWE HIM MONEY.

41:40.733 --> 41:43.667
IT'S ABOUT ACCEPTANCE.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.733
GEORGE.

41:45.767 --> 41:48.767
***

41:52.367 --> 41:53.733
(sniffles)

41:53.767 --> 41:57.133
***

41:57.167 --> 41:59.433
I'M EXHAUSTED.

41:59.467 --> 42:01.433
EVERY BONE...

42:01.467 --> 42:03.433
AND EVERY MUSCLE
IN MY BODY...

42:03.467 --> 42:06.233
(sobs) ACHES.

42:06.267 --> 42:08.267
AND I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.800
I DON'T--

42:09.833 --> 42:12.400
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO,
BECAUSE I DO. I DO.

42:12.433 --> 42:14.333
I REALLY, REALLY DO.

42:14.367 --> 42:16.667
IT'S JUST THAT I-I JUST SPENT
SIX AND A HALF HOURS

42:16.700 --> 42:18.200
ON MY FEET IN SURGERY,

42:18.233 --> 42:20.667
AND I CAN BARELY
HOLD MYSELF UP,

42:20.700 --> 42:22.600
AND I'M JUST SO TIRED.
(sobs)

42:22.633 --> 42:25.667
THIS IS--THIS IS LIKE A--
A RARE BIRD, GEORGE.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.833
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE FIRST TIME
THAT WE'RE TOGETHER

42:27.867 --> 42:29.767
SINCE--
SINCE WE WERE TOGETHER,

42:29.800 --> 42:31.833
AND IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
EXPERIENCE.

42:31.867 --> 42:33.767
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE IT.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.833
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE IT
ON A NIGHT

42:35.867 --> 42:37.767
THAT I'M TOO EXHAUSTED
TO ENJOY IT

42:37.800 --> 42:39.833
BECAUSE I WANT TO ENJOY
OUR RARE BIRD, GEORGE.

42:39.867 --> 42:41.767
I NEED TO ENJOY
OUR RARE BIRD. (sobs)

42:41.800 --> 42:44.133
ME, TOO. I...

42:44.167 --> 42:47.200
AND OH, MY HAND IS JUST,

42:47.233 --> 42:49.667
OH, IT'S JUST KILLING ME
FROM HOLDING THAT DRESS.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.267
IT'S--AAH.

42:51.300 --> 42:52.633
S-SO MAYBE TO--

42:52.667 --> 42:55.500
MAYBE TONIGHT'S
NOT THE PERFECT NIGHT.

42:55.533 --> 42:57.567
MAYBE A PERFECT NIGHT IS...

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
ANOTHER NIGHT.

42:59.633 --> 43:01.567
REALLY?

43:01.600 --> 43:03.833
YEAH.

43:03.867 --> 43:06.133
YEAH.

43:06.167 --> 43:09.267
***

43:09.300 --> 43:14.067
DO YOU WANT TO MAYBE, UH...
GO TO SLEEP?

43:14.100 --> 43:15.733
YEAH. YEAH.

43:15.767 --> 43:18.333
OKAY.

43:18.367 --> 43:21.433
***

43:21.467 --> 43:23.600
OH, THANKS.

43:23.633 --> 43:25.500
OKAY.

***

43:31.467 --> 43:34.267
DID YOU ONLY SHAVE
ONE OF YOUR LEGS?

43:34.300 --> 43:36.200
(crying) I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

43:36.233 --> 43:38.133
NO, NO,
I WAS JUST WONDERING.

43:38.167 --> 43:40.067
IT'S COOL. IT'S--IT'S OKAY.
SHH. SORRY.

43:40.100 --> 43:41.600
IT'S--IT'S--

43:41.633 --> 43:43.533
OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T DO IT.

43:43.567 --> 43:45.467
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION

43:45.500 --> 43:47.600
TO NOT BE HARD-CORE FOR ONCE.

43:47.633 --> 43:49.533
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE
A SLEEPING PILL.

43:49.567 --> 43:51.200
OH, NO.
DON'T DO THAT.

43:51.233 --> 43:52.467
YOU'LL JUST GET STRUNG OUT

43:52.500 --> 43:54.533
AND TURN INTO
A BAD AFTERSCHOOL SPECIAL.

43:54.567 --> 43:58.367
WE'LL JUST SLEEP,
AND... YOU'LL SLEEP.

STOP SEEING DEREK.

44:06.767 --> 44:09.100
***

44:09.133 --> 44:14.700
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SEX.
IT'S NOT... ABOUT THE SEX.

44:14.733 --> 44:17.500
IT'S ABOUT
THAT MOMENT AFTERWARD...

44:19.400 --> 44:22.233
WHEN THE WORLD STOPS.

44:23.567 --> 44:26.567
IT JUST FEELS SO SAFE...

44:28.300 --> 44:30.700
SO SAFE.

44:32.100 --> 44:34.733
I'M NOT READY
TO GIVE THAT UP.

44:34.767 --> 44:37.333
***

44:37.367 --> 44:40.233
DOES THAT MAKE ME SAD
AND WEAK AND PATHETIC?

44:40.267 --> 44:42.233
A LITTLE BIT.

44:42.267 --> 44:46.033
***

44:46.067 --> 44:48.267
WHAT DO I DO?

***

44:50.233 --> 44:52.800
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

44:52.833 --> 44:56.233
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE TOUGH
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY.

44:56.267 --> 44:58.167
IT'S OKAY TO LET DOWN
YOUR GUARD.

44:58.200 --> 45:01.067
IN FACT, THERE ARE MOMENTS
WHEN IT'S THE BEST THING

45:01.100 --> 45:03.033
YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO...

45:03.067 --> 45:04.400
(glass breaking, laughter)

45:04.433 --> 45:06.100
OH.
