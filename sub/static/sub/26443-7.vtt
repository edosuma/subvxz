00:23.560 --> 00:26.160
<i>What happened in town</i>
<i>a few days before Marina's death?</i>

00:26.240 --> 00:28.960
What do you mean?
Haven't you seen the news?

00:29.040 --> 00:31.200
-Is there no police report?
-I want you to tell me.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.360
Everything happened.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.320
-Things were really tense.
-Too much.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.040
When gunpowder meets fire...

00:36.120 --> 00:38.240
-...only one thing can happen.
-An explosion.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.360
Everything went to shit.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.120
Everything.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.760
The burner phone,
so they can't trace the call.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.680
OK.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.040
-Got the marchioness' husband's number?
-Yes.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.120
Here it is.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.920
His name is Teodoro Rosol.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.560
We need to decide how much to ask for
for the watch.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.720
A whole lot, the more the better.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.480
That one will pay whatever we ask
to get this back.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.640
No, we need to be smart about this.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.520
It has to be an amount he can get
without attracting attention.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.280
How much is that for a rich person?
Two hundred thousand?

01:18.480 --> 01:20.880
-Five hundred thousand?
-He won't have that at home.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.080
Much less. Besides, if he withdraws
from a bank, they'll trace it.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.000
I'd ask for 90,000.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.240
Yes, 90,000 is good.
With that, we can do a lot.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.360
I could start over somewhere else
with half that money.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.000
Are you sure you want to leave?
We are OK, aren't we?

01:41.760 --> 01:43.680
I don't want to miss you again.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.040
I'm not needed here, Samu.
You'll be better off without me.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.360
Believe me.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.520
It will be good for everybody.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.680
No, they've frozen our accounts,
and we can't make bail.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.760
Three hundred thousand.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.640
No.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.040
No, you wouldn't have to cover it all.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.760
I see.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.240
Fine. Thank you, Federico.
Have a good day.

02:37.880 --> 02:38.840
Asshole.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.080
My mothers can cover part of it.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.280
For more, they'd have to withdraw
from investment funds, which takes time.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.840
Thank you. Tell them I'll call them later.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.560
What about Lu's parents?

02:51.960 --> 02:54.120
They're diplomats,
they can't get involved.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.000
Besides,
I don't want anything to do with her.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.320
I get it.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.640
Testing. One, two, one, two. Testing.

03:04.920 --> 03:05.880
Let's hear it.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.520
<i>Testing. One, two, one, two. Testing.</i>

03:08.960 --> 03:10.920
-Good, right? Sure?
-Yes.

03:11.000 --> 03:11.840
OK.

03:23.080 --> 03:23.920
Hello?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
Yes, speaking.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.080
<i>We have something you want.</i>

03:30.160 --> 03:33.400
<i>You don't want it to end up in the papers,</i>
<i>or with a judge.</i>

03:33.480 --> 03:34.360
Who are you?

03:36.560 --> 03:40.280
<i>-Do you have my watch?</i>
<i>-</i>We want 90,000 euros. Tomorrow.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.680
Ninety thousand euros?

03:44.880 --> 03:47.760
You better hand it to me tomorrow,
and expect nothing in return.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.640
You don't know who you're messing with,
idiots.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.760
Have the money tomorrow.
We'll contact you for the exchange.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.440
How was it?

03:59.720 --> 04:00.720
Fine, I think.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
-He was scared.
-Good.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.600
-He'll pay for sure.
-Good.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.480
Who do they think they are?

04:10.960 --> 04:13.280
They want to blackmail me? Me?

04:13.440 --> 04:16.720
-They want a measly 90,000 euros!
-You're not paying?

04:17.120 --> 04:21.000
-How could I give in to amateurs?
-Wouldn't it be better to pay?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.800
It's not that much money.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.680
-Do you know them, or what?
-That's ridiculous, Dad!

04:28.560 --> 04:32.640
I'm only saying the person who called
is a clueless nobody.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.040
When they got in here to steal,
they even knew the alarm codes.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.160
And since you associate
with just anybody lately...

04:39.240 --> 04:40.760
-Good morning, Carla.
-Hi.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.280
-Teodoro.
-Good morning, darling.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.680
-I can't believe you'd say this to me--
-Everything all right?

04:47.760 --> 04:48.720
Yeah.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.600
Don't worry. If someone's tried
to pull one over on me, I know what to do.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.280
So do I.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.600
To begin with,
they won't get a single cent. Not one.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.120
They should know that.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.720
Were you waiting for me?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.960
I've been up since seven,
making calls to get the money.

05:29.040 --> 05:29.920
It's horrible.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.120
I see.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.360
I'm sure someone will lend it to you.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.840
Doesn't seem like it.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.480
Rats are the first to abandon ship,
and my father's world was full of rats.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.480
It's good to see you.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.840
Are you going to stick to me like glue
all day?

05:47.320 --> 05:50.200
What will your friends think
when they see you this clingy?

05:50.760 --> 05:53.960
I want to make the most of these days
with you, in case they're the last.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.280
We have to keep you here
for the next school year.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.120
It's hopeless, Guzmán.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.120
Once my father makes up his mind,
he's inflexible.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.040
You should go to class.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.840
-Go on.
-Fine, I'm going. Bye.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.520
Nadia.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.760
-Can you do me a favor?
-Yes.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.160
Give this to your brother?

06:27.080 --> 06:27.920
My brother?

06:29.360 --> 06:31.240
Yes. Your father took his phone away.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.400
I don't want to go near the store,
or they could see me talking to him.

06:46.920 --> 06:47.760
Nadia.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.080
-Can we talk after class?
-We have nothing to talk about.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.360
Do you realize
you've ruined my brother's life?

06:54.440 --> 06:58.680
That's why I want to talk, to explain.
I didn't have a choice, Nadia.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.120
There's always a choice, Marina. Always.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.680
But people from your class never consider
anything but saving their own ass.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.000
-If you'll excuse me...
-So my betraying your brother is wrong,

07:07.080 --> 07:09.720
but your betraying Martín is awesome,
right?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.560
Are you really making that comparison?

07:14.440 --> 07:16.440
We need to talk.
Come to the bathroom with me?

07:26.080 --> 07:27.080
I'm all ears.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.160
Why did you get close to me
after ignoring me for years?

07:32.360 --> 07:33.200
What?

07:33.840 --> 07:35.280
Who stole the watches?

07:36.240 --> 07:37.800
I know you are involved.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.160
You were in my house,
you saw me enter the code.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.560
As girls,
we played with my father's watches.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.160
You knew where they were.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.720
Me?

07:45.960 --> 07:49.200
Come on, do you think I remember that?
How can you think that?

07:49.280 --> 07:52.720
Well, you have a history
of making crappy friends

07:52.800 --> 07:54.800
and falling under their influence.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.280
You seem stupid.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.920
Marina, they are blackmailing us.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.360
And your family stands to lose
more than mine.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.560
Your father is in pre-trial detention,
and if these papers surface...

08:06.640 --> 08:08.640
not even the best lawyer will get him out.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.920
-Carla, I know nothing about it, really.
-My father will not pay.

08:13.320 --> 08:17.240
You think he's going to let some idiots
take his money and get away with it?

08:17.720 --> 08:18.560
No.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.480
He's going to find them,
and it'll be bad for everybody.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.040
Mostly for you.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.280
So tell them to keep the watches,
but to return the red one.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.680
And to do it now.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.560
Fucking Nano!

08:37.480 --> 08:39.320
<i>We agreed you'd forget the blackmail.</i>

08:40.000 --> 08:43.440
-You've put me in a difficult situation!
<i>-Don't worry about a thing.</i>

08:43.520 --> 08:47.840
How can I not worry?
That watch contains sensitive information.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.000
If it reaches the press,
it'll ruin my family.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.400
I won't let you do it.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.240
<i>That information won't reach anybody,</i>
<i>trust me.</i>

08:55.360 --> 08:58.880
<i>That guy will pay.</i>
<i>We need that money to go away together.</i>

09:00.640 --> 09:02.560
I haven't said I'm leaving with you.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.400
Carla.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
Here.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.080
-What's this?
-Do you like it?

09:24.160 --> 09:25.560
A bit obvious, don't you think?

09:27.320 --> 09:30.240
Your way of telling me
you can buy me these things,

09:30.320 --> 09:31.320
and Christian can't.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.400
It's a present. I'm not trying to buy you.

09:34.480 --> 09:38.480
You can't buy me. I don't have a price.
If I did, you couldn't afford it.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.960
Are you going to let that loser
ruin everything?

09:43.320 --> 09:45.240
You ruined it. Not him.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.520
And I'm the one in front of you,
asking you to forgive me.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.280
I don't...

09:51.960 --> 09:53.760
I can't live without you.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.240
-Don't you see I can't?
-Yes, you can.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.520
You know why?

09:59.120 --> 10:01.040
Because, I think you like boys
more than girls.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.160
And it's no big deal. That's fine.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.160
You just need to accept it yourself.
I'm working on it.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.600
So what if I also like guys?

10:09.760 --> 10:13.040
What we have is stronger than all that.
We're Carla and Polo.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.800
We go together.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.400
That can't be broken.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.200
It's already broken.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.480
Would you like a photo?

10:49.320 --> 10:52.720
It's your moment of triumph.
I'd like to give you my best angle.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.480
You are top of the class,
the prize is for you. As if I cared.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.880
Lu, I'm also leaving the school.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.600
My father doesn't want me
to do my next year here.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.760
So we won the top idiot prize
by competing, right?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.640
-I never wanted to compete.
-Nadia, please!

11:16.920 --> 11:21.080
From day one I, recognized you
as my equal. Even if you won't admit it.

11:22.680 --> 11:27.320
For you and me, nothing is ever enough.
We always want more.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.960
Did you really think that prize
would change anything in my life?

11:33.520 --> 11:34.360
No.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.440
And still... I needed it.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.720
Too bad another hypocrite will get it.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.440
Marina?

11:47.160 --> 11:49.480
She's the best after the two of us.

11:50.640 --> 11:55.280
She really screwed us over.
She turned out to be the smartest of all.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.720
But I'll tell you one thing.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.600
I won't leave without a fight.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.040
Or without winning.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.080
-So what happened between you and Polo?
-I left him.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.080
We wanted to keep our relationship alive,
but dead things don't come back to life.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.960
Damn, I'm sorry.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.720
So you have no boyfriend?
You're on your own, free.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.240
Yes, on my own, free,

12:23.320 --> 12:25.600
with no close friends,
and a thousand problems.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.880
I did not expect this
going into the summer.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.600
-But then you and I could...
-We could what, Christian?

12:30.680 --> 12:32.160
We could date!

12:32.600 --> 12:34.520
-We have great sex, right?
-Yes.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.920
But I don't know if I'd date someone
who sells himself for a cover.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.400
I don't sell myself, OK?

12:39.480 --> 12:42.560
I make a living, which is what those of us
who weren't born rich do!

12:42.640 --> 12:45.800
-It's very easy to judge us from up there.
-All right!

12:46.440 --> 12:47.840
Christian, wait!

12:48.760 --> 12:51.280
Fine, you're right.
I'm not in your situation.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.720
Don't you think that's why
we can't be together?

12:53.800 --> 12:56.320
Honestly, no.
Stranger things have happened.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.760
-You could give me a chance.
-The only thing I need now is a friend.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.080
Think you can be that?

13:05.800 --> 13:06.680
Yes.

13:09.160 --> 13:13.000
Omar! Remember Fatima and Nasser?

13:13.080 --> 13:15.560
-Of course.
-She used to look after you.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.640
-How are you? You're all grown up.
-How are you?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.960
A very good son. Very responsible.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.800
Follows the Koran. And very hardworking.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.160
He has a daughter, about your age.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.240
-You know her, right?
-Yes.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.000
Why don't you come for tea
on Wednesday and bring her along?

13:34.600 --> 13:37.560
I don't know if I can on Wednesday.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.160
You have something better to do
than meet your future wife?

13:42.640 --> 13:43.720
Bye, then.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.160
And don't rush him.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.680
We don't want him looking that scared
when we introduce them.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.520
-See you soon.
-Bye, my friend.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.360
I get it, my father is a leper,
and you won't help him. Fine.

13:55.440 --> 13:59.120
When he returns to work, I'll remind him
who was there for him, asshole!

13:59.680 --> 14:03.240
-Everything all right?
-What are you doing here, Lu?

14:05.160 --> 14:07.920
I go to school for my things,
and don't see you.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.480
I call and text you, and you don't answer.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.600
I'm beginning to feel a bit ignored,
actually.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.560
You don't see me for three days,
and I'm already forgotten?

14:18.640 --> 14:21.000
Sorry, I don't know why,
but all I can think about

14:21.080 --> 14:22.640
is getting money to bail my father out.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.640
I see.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.920
And you can't answer one of my messages
while you're holding your phone?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.880
Lu, right now, the last thing I need
is your passive-aggressive drama.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.680
And what do you need? Money.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.680
-How much?
-300,000. Got that in your bag?

14:41.560 --> 14:43.480
Why are you being such a jerk?

14:43.560 --> 14:46.720
-I only wanted to help.
-Oh, you came to help me. Sorry!

14:46.800 --> 14:49.280
I thought it was
because I didn't answer your calls.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.640
If you're having a hard time,
you can lean on me.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.760
But don't insult me.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.120
And don't push me aside.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.080
We've always supported each other
through the good and the bad.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.800
"We," Lu?

15:06.960 --> 15:09.440
How do I put this
so that you finally get it?

15:11.240 --> 15:12.720
There is no "we" anymore.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.760
That's nonsense.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.280
I'm in love with Nadia.

15:27.640 --> 15:30.160
You're not in your right mind
because of your father.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.000
You don't know what you're saying.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.480
Did you see what happened at the store?
Now they want to marry me off.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.560
It's a nightmare.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.640
Omar, she's a good girl.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.360
Really, Nadia? You too?

15:57.440 --> 15:58.760
Are you serious?

15:59.960 --> 16:03.320
There are arranged marriages
that turn out fine.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.480
Before marrying her or any other,
I'd slit my wrists.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.120
-No. Don't even joke about that.
-Get it?

16:10.640 --> 16:14.520
Nadia, I don't want to be introduced
to that girl. Help me, please.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.160
Dad is very upset.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.440
But it will blow over.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.240
All you have to do is go along with him
for a while.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.280
For how long?

16:25.680 --> 16:28.000
Until my wedding day?
Until my children get married?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.920
No, I can't, Nadia.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.200
Nadia, I can't breathe anymore.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.840
Help me, please.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.720
Ander gave me this, for you.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.600
You really like him, huh?

17:08.440 --> 17:10.720
But I'll never be able to be with him.

17:23.080 --> 17:25.080
Go to him. I'll cover for you.

17:26.600 --> 17:27.800
You mean it?

17:30.560 --> 17:31.440
Thank you.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.680
We can't accept this.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
What we have to do
is ask for twice as much.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.720
If they know Marina has something to do
with this, they'll get to us in no time.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.840
And what are they going to do?
Call the police?

17:55.960 --> 17:57.320
Hire thugs?

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
No, better yet,
they will come for us themselves.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.280
They will give in.
They act tough, but they will give in.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.160
We have to think our next move through.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.680
Hey.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
You came.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.840
-Want to go inside?
-OK.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Sure your parents aren't here?

19:03.040 --> 19:04.680
OK, I can see they are not.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.880
So, shall we fuck?

19:14.440 --> 19:15.640
Or we could talk.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.400
While we fuck.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.640
Are you going to let your father
arrange a wedding for you?

19:42.040 --> 19:43.120
It's absurd.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.200
That's what you want to talk about?
What a downer.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.200
You won't let him do it, right?

19:57.080 --> 19:59.040
When did you figure out you liked men?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.320
You're changing the subject.

20:10.520 --> 20:13.640
Do you know what two gay guys
ask each other when they meet?

20:15.320 --> 20:18.960
That's the first one.
When you found out you liked guys.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.640
The second one
is whether your parents know.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.600
I want this moment to be ours.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.880
And not to think that somebody out there
is arranging a wedding for me.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.440
OK. But they are arranging it.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.880
Do your parents know?

20:58.280 --> 20:59.160
You know what?

21:03.160 --> 21:04.040
I love you.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.080
You are so lucky.

21:24.640 --> 21:29.040
-I never have the house to myself.
-I have it to myself every day until ten.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.960
-See you.
-Bye.

21:59.640 --> 22:00.840
What's going on?

22:04.200 --> 22:05.200
Answer it.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.760
-Wait, let me talk.
-No, I'll talk.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.720
-Fine, put it on speakerphone.
-OK.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.800
-Hello.
-How do we go about the handover?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.680
<i>When are you giving me the watch?</i>

22:16.800 --> 22:19.760
-We want double now.
<i>-What?</i>

22:20.440 --> 22:22.320
One hundred and eighty thousand.

22:23.320 --> 22:27.480
Who do you think you are?
Nobody will pay that much.

22:28.040 --> 22:28.960
Nobody.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.600
<i>You've just dug your own grave.</i>

22:35.240 --> 22:39.080
-He hung up, but he'll pay for sure.
<i>-</i>Next time, let me do the talking.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.080
If there is a next time, fuck!

23:01.760 --> 23:04.200
We know you're... gay.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.400
-Gay.
-Gay.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.680
And it's not a problem.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.360
-Did you look at my computer?
-There was no need.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.000
Son, it's all right.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.640
If, at his age, I'd told my father
I was a faggot...

23:21.720 --> 23:23.720
-Antonio.
-...he would have hit me.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.440
Fine. What I want to say is that you
shouldn't let that ruin your future.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.960
Tennis is not like soccer.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.600
It's not a paradise of tolerance,

23:32.680 --> 23:34.240
but you could make history

23:34.320 --> 23:36.320
as the first gay man
to win the French Open.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.720
Think about it.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.880
I'm sure there's plenty of sponsors
who'd love to work with a boy...

23:42.480 --> 23:43.600
like you.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.560
OK.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.960
So I can fuck guys
as long as I am a champion.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.880
You can listen to music later.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.880
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.800
What's his name?

24:11.880 --> 24:16.880
His name's Omar. But we can't be together
because his father's from the Stone Age.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.960
Omar, is that Arabic?

24:21.480 --> 24:23.160
-You disapprove?
-Who, me?

24:23.360 --> 24:28.320
What kind of person do you think I am?
What you think of us is alarming!

24:34.280 --> 24:36.040
You could talk to his father.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.280
Me? I don't know him.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.240
He's Nadia's brother.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.200
Omar?

24:45.760 --> 24:46.640
That Omar?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.680
The one who sells drugs?

24:50.720 --> 24:53.480
-Are you in love with a dealer?
-He's not a dealer, Mom!

24:53.560 --> 24:56.440
He used to deal because he needs money
to get out of that house.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.160
Help us, please.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.400
He's not lucky enough
to have parents like you.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.240
Talk to his father.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.240
And what would I tell him?

25:11.880 --> 25:13.040
I can't, Ander.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.640
Only you...

25:16.680 --> 25:19.080
So many guys out there,
and you fall for a dealer.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.080
A dealer who's Muslim and gay.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.120
Mom.

25:35.120 --> 25:39.360
I heard you want Omar
to meet Fatima's daughter.

25:40.040 --> 25:40.920
Zahira.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.880
Yes, a very good girl.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.760
She is, right?

25:50.880 --> 25:52.440
You know her, don't you?

25:54.320 --> 25:57.200
Nadia,
do you have anything to say about her?

25:59.560 --> 26:02.040
No. I won't speak ill of Zahira.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.200
What about Fatima's daughter?

26:06.920 --> 26:11.200
I think we all want Omar
to marry the right person.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.720
If you have something to say, say it.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.800
In this town, we all know each other.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.600
Why don't you ask around?

26:20.720 --> 26:21.720
There's no need.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.680
I'll call them and cancel tea myself.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.840
Our son cannot marry just anybody.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.920
Besides, why the rush?

26:51.240 --> 26:52.160
Thank you.

26:53.080 --> 26:56.560
I'm also doing it for her.
She doesn't deserve an unhappy marriage.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.560
-May I come in?
-Of course, Guzmán.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.360
-What is it?
-I wanted to talk to you about Nadia.

27:19.880 --> 27:24.000
Did you know she's not coming back
next year? Her father forbids it.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.840
-Oh. No, I didn't know.
-We can't let that happen.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.800
Education is no longer compulsory
at your age.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.560
If her father wants to remove her
from school, he can.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.280
Why should she pay
for her father's intolerance?

27:39.120 --> 27:41.400
She didn't choose to be born
into a family like that.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.400
Nadia wants to be here.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.800
She's a great student.
She has a scholarship.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.320
We can't let her go.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.760
You started to date Marina
and you found out she was pregnant.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.360
-Didn't that bother you?
-No.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.280
Of course not.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.600
It was hard at first,
but I did not resent it.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.560
Samuel, are you telling me
the whole truth?

28:33.440 --> 28:36.440
Samuel, all of this is a bit absurd,
to be honest.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.720
You don't need to avoid me
whenever we're in the same room.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.640
You know full well
I didn't want to hurt you.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.000
I need someone to lean on now,

28:49.960 --> 28:52.680
-to tell everything--
-That's not going to be me.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.400
Can you give us a moment? We need to talk.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.360
Remember when I told you
the blackmailers were nobodies?

29:04.440 --> 29:06.640
That they had asked for very little money?

29:07.520 --> 29:10.960
-Today, they asked for twice that amount.
-What do you mean by that?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.800
Marina, that proves you talked to them.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.120
I don't give a rat's ass how you do it,
but you need to get that watch.

29:18.200 --> 29:22.480
Fall in love with whoever you want.
Play at being the rebel, the misfit.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.120
I don't care.

29:24.920 --> 29:27.880
But don't risk everything you have
and endanger your family.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.880
-Thank you for coming again.
-This is becoming a habit.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.680
-What happened now?
-Nothing bad, I assure you.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.920
It's about your daughter.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.920
I heard you don't want her to come here
next school year.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.240
We are delighted with her.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.640
She's got an excellent record here.
She has adapted wonderfully.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.920
-It's a thoughtfully considered decision.
-I'm not saying it isn't.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.040
But if only there were a way
to change your mind...

29:57.640 --> 30:00.760
We think you are taking
a wonderful opportunity from her.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.800
Are you saying I'm a bad father?
That, as an uneducated Muslim,

30:06.880 --> 30:08.640
-I don't know what's best for her?
-No.

30:09.920 --> 30:12.960
I'm just trying to make you see
that Nadia...

30:13.040 --> 30:15.480
would have many advantages,
were she to remain here.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.400
-She has learned a lot so far.
-Yes.

30:18.600 --> 30:23.000
She has learned to disrespect her parents.
To lie, to sneak out of her house.

30:23.320 --> 30:28.040
-To neglect her religious duties.
-She's a teenager. They rebel at that age.

30:28.120 --> 30:28.960
Hey.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.200
What are you doing? We have an exam.

30:34.520 --> 30:38.560
Is that what you teach here?
To tolerate rebelliousness?

30:41.200 --> 30:43.280
Don't turn over the paper
until I tell you to.

30:44.320 --> 30:48.000
Don't worry, there's nothing there
we haven't gone over a thousand times.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.760
Excuse me.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.160
What are you doing here, Lucrecia?
You're suspended.

30:53.240 --> 30:57.320
I know,
but I have the right to take this exam.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.880
I'll sit over there.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.760
Nadia, we're leaving.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.000
-What?
-I'm taking you out of here immediately.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.920
-Let's go.
-Excuse me. Yusef, let's talk.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.120
Don't take it like that.
I never meant to offend you.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.560
Don't make her pay for it.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.680
Nadia, let's go.
Don't make me repeat myself.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.400
Dad, we're about to start an exam.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.360
Let's go!

31:19.120 --> 31:21.240
-Don't treat her like that.
-Shut up!

31:22.440 --> 31:25.640
-Don't grab her like that!
-Dad!

31:25.720 --> 31:28.400
I feel for her! For her and for your son.

31:28.720 --> 31:33.240
To be a woman or a homosexual
in your family must be hell! Poor Omar!

31:33.800 --> 31:34.680
Dad.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.160
Hey!

31:37.240 --> 31:39.720
What?
What are you insinuating about my son?

31:44.520 --> 31:45.720
Go back to class.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.560
Let's go.

31:49.840 --> 31:50.840
You too.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.160
Come on.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.520
Carry on with your exam.
Nothing to worry about.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.720
-What are you doing here?
-She says she has a right to be here.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.200
Out. Right now.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.080
What are you laughing at, idiot?

32:32.040 --> 32:34.400
If you think you'll get Carla,
you're mistaken.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.960
As a hobby you were fine, but...
you're not enough for her.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.160
Sure. But I was enough for you, right?

32:44.400 --> 32:46.560
What did you like best about me? My ass.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.520
Or my dick?
Because you sure held on to it.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.600
Asking for a beating, are you?

32:54.680 --> 32:57.760
You'll never be her boyfriend,
you hear me? Never!

32:58.640 --> 32:59.480
Maybe.

32:59.640 --> 33:02.800
But that is more likely to happen
than you fucking me again.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.520
I didn't force you, remember?

33:06.800 --> 33:09.120
You allowed yourself to be bought.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.040
You're no better than me.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.160
What are you looking at?

33:23.320 --> 33:24.200
What's wrong?

33:24.280 --> 33:27.080
Your fucking ex!
He knows how to push my buttons!

33:27.160 --> 33:29.560
Calm down. Look at me, OK? Calm down.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.160
Ignore him. Just ignore him.

33:34.080 --> 33:34.920
OK?

33:35.280 --> 33:38.520
We could do something fun today.
Introduce me to your friends.

33:39.680 --> 33:43.240
You know my world,
but I don't know yours.<i></i>OK?

33:46.800 --> 33:47.800
You!

33:48.960 --> 33:52.920
Tell me why you are being slandered!
Why do they think you like men?

33:53.000 --> 33:53.840
Dad!

33:54.720 --> 33:56.200
Tell me it's not true!

33:56.280 --> 33:57.280
Tell me!

33:58.760 --> 33:59.640
Dad...

34:00.560 --> 34:02.480
Tell me my son is not a homosexual.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.640
No, I don't know who told you that,
but no.

34:10.040 --> 34:10.960
I'm not.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.560
It's all right.

34:15.160 --> 34:17.320
Tomorrow we'll see Fatima
and her daughter.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.760
And if she's not the right wife for you,
then another.

34:21.640 --> 34:23.120
But we'll find one soon.

34:23.680 --> 34:26.000
I'm not going to let anybody tarnish
your good name.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.680
Or this family's.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.080
I am a coward.

34:42.120 --> 34:42.960
No.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.080
You did what you had to do.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.520
What happened? Why does he know?

34:52.040 --> 34:54.360
-The school principal told him.
-What?

34:54.680 --> 34:58.400
Isn't that Ander's mother?
What is she doing? She's ruined my life.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.760
Yours and mine.
Dad dragged me out of class.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.440
In front of everybody.<i></i>So humiliating.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.320
-Hello, Pilar.
-Hi, cutie.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.880
-Is Samuel here?
-No, he's at work.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.720
Do you mind if I wait for him here?

35:22.360 --> 35:24.800
-Sure, come in.
-I don't want to go home.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.640
Because of what's going on with my father.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.040
Some story, that one.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.040
I know.

35:31.680 --> 35:35.440
-I don't think he'll be long.
<i>-</i>It's OK, I'll wait here.

35:36.440 --> 35:38.200
You caught me with my cards.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.720
Hey, do you want me to read them for you?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.640
Maybe we find out
when your father gets out.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.960
-No.
-This is never wrong.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.280
-Could I use your bathroom?
-Of course, you know where it is.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.200
Thank you.

36:23.040 --> 36:23.920
Shit.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.760
Looking for this?

36:32.960 --> 36:34.720
Yes, but not to give it to them.

36:36.080 --> 36:39.000
I wanted to keep it,
and keep it from the papers.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.720
I told you I wouldn't give it
to the papers.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.320
But here.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.680
I do trust you.

36:58.360 --> 36:59.760
I only ask one thing.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.640
Let them pay us.

37:03.680 --> 37:07.480
That money is loose change to them.
A bargain, after what they did.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.680
And when they pay us,
you do what you want with the watch.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.280
You sure?

37:16.720 --> 37:17.560
Marina...

37:22.200 --> 37:24.040
we are having a child together.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.600
If I don't trust you,
who am I going to trust?

37:31.280 --> 37:33.120
I haven't decided to keep it yet.

37:37.960 --> 37:41.280
Do you know how many calls
I had to make to get that money?

37:41.640 --> 37:43.640
Do you know what it cost me?

37:43.880 --> 37:45.840
But that didn't matter to those losers.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.960
Because, to them,
we are only fucking rich snobs.

37:49.800 --> 37:53.960
You didn't think the town would be upset?
To see your father go free?

37:54.040 --> 37:56.320
What? The law is the same for everybody.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.600
If a judge sets bail, and you can pay it,
that's not illegal.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.920
You didn't know
you were walking into a hornet's nest?

38:06.400 --> 38:07.320
Marina.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.960
-Look who's here.
-Dad! They released you!

38:12.200 --> 38:16.120
Thanks to your brother, who didn't stop
until he raised the money to pay bail.

38:19.520 --> 38:20.800
He's shown me a lot.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.480
-Marina, we need to talk.
-About what, Dad?

38:25.080 --> 38:28.560
Teo tells me you are involved
in the theft of the watches.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.600
Who are your friends?

38:31.480 --> 38:33.520
-They've brainwashed you.
-Honey...

38:34.080 --> 38:37.360
Do you know how serious this is?
All that's at stake?

38:37.440 --> 38:41.200
-Dad, why do you think I'm involved?
-Carla told us everything.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.680
And it wouldn't be the first time you
hang out with riffraff.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.960
Riffraff, Guzmán?

38:47.320 --> 38:49.360
Dad went to jail,
but they're the riffraff?

38:49.440 --> 38:51.520
-What are you saying?
-Don't go there, please.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.800
So you do have something
to do with those losers.

38:53.880 --> 38:57.800
-Marina, you just don't learn.
-What losers are you talking about?

38:57.880 --> 39:01.160
I'm tired of your arrogance, and yours.

39:01.240 --> 39:04.720
So they caught you red-handed?
Deal with it!

39:04.800 --> 39:07.240
Just a moment! Everybody calm down!

39:07.320 --> 39:08.680
Sure, ask us to calm down now.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.720
How can I calm down with this nutjob here

39:10.800 --> 39:14.160
-who prefers those losers to her family!
-You know what, Guzmán?

39:14.520 --> 39:17.800
With those people you call losers,
I'm making my own family.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.080
More authentic and less hypocritical!

39:20.160 --> 39:21.280
What do you mean?

39:24.880 --> 39:26.160
I'm pregnant.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.840
Marina. Please, say that's not true.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.200
Who's the father?

39:36.600 --> 39:37.560
That waiter?

39:38.640 --> 39:40.960
No. His brother.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.760
That's why you helped him
with the theft, huh?

39:46.200 --> 39:49.040
That's it. I'll fix this right now!

39:49.120 --> 39:50.480
Where are you going?

39:52.080 --> 39:55.440
Ander, call Polo. You have to help me.
Now!

39:56.040 --> 39:58.760
Marina, please.
Think about what you're saying.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.640
Don't do things
out of spite for your parents.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.520
You can't have a child now.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.680
Much less with a boy like that!

40:06.120 --> 40:11.200
-Even you should realize that!
-Do you think I can reason with you?

40:11.280 --> 40:13.480
Look at yourself! You're so prejudiced!

40:13.560 --> 40:17.480
Just thinking your girl may not date
a future minister makes you freak out!

40:17.560 --> 40:22.760
-That boy is blackmailing us!
-You are a minor, and you'll do as we say.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.360
That's it. You will not go ahead
with that pregnancy, you hear?

40:26.440 --> 40:30.200
Wait and see. But don't worry,
this child will not meet its grandparents.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.680
Nano,

40:48.120 --> 40:51.560
listen, we can leave together
whenever you want, OK?

40:55.400 --> 40:56.960
Guzmán, this is crazy.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.400
Wait, stop. Stop, damn it!

40:59.480 --> 41:00.800
What? Damn it, Ander!

41:00.880 --> 41:04.040
Should I remind you what happened
last time you tried to fix things?

41:04.120 --> 41:06.320
-They got fixed.
-You almost killed Pablo.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.360
We go to their house,
take what's ours, and leave.

41:09.440 --> 41:12.840
-Or are you getting cold feet?
-They're not home. Carla just posted this.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.600
-I swear she's all right.
-Carla's here for a reason.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.520
Why else would she ask so many questions?
She doesn't trust me or my brother.

41:27.600 --> 41:31.040
No, man, she likes me, for real.
She's crazy about me.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.600
Son of a bitch!
You may fool your brother, but not me.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.040
First you steal from me.
And then get my sister pregnant.

42:18.840 --> 42:20.000
You are an asshole!

42:20.080 --> 42:21.560
Ah! Fuck!

42:21.640 --> 42:24.240
-I won't let that bastard end up with you!
-Go to hell!

42:25.120 --> 42:27.520
Son of a bitch!

42:37.080 --> 42:37.960
Ander!

42:38.440 --> 42:39.520
Let's go!

42:55.280 --> 42:57.480
-Come back here!
-Son of a bitch!

43:31.840 --> 43:33.320
Please, open up.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.920
-I'm being chased!
-Go away!

43:35.000 --> 43:36.760
Nadia.

43:36.840 --> 43:39.240
He's not your problem.
Let him fend for himself!

43:39.320 --> 43:41.760
-Say what you want, he's coming in.
-They're after me!

43:42.400 --> 43:44.920
-Call the police!
-Why the police?

43:45.000 --> 43:48.560
-If I catch that bastard, he'll be sorry!
-Son of a bitch!

43:48.680 --> 43:52.320
See why I didn't want you to befriend him?
He's trouble!

44:12.800 --> 44:13.760
Ander!

44:14.480 --> 44:15.320
Ander!

44:21.280 --> 44:24.200
I love you. I love you, damn it!

44:30.160 --> 44:33.360
Asshole, they had to kill me
for you to say it.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.600
Oh, what's wrong?

44:41.640 --> 44:42.480
Samuel?

44:45.440 --> 44:47.040
Samuel, what's going on?

44:52.480 --> 44:53.480
Samuel.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.320
Samuel, what did you do?

46:14.920 --> 46:17.680
