00:21.765 --> 00:24.101
Brody. Hi.

00:24.670 --> 00:25.730
Sarah.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.721
What a nice surprise.

00:31.178 --> 00:32.460
What are you doing here?

00:33.462 --> 00:34.526
Uh...

00:35.136 --> 00:38.084
I could say I just stopped in
on the way to somewhere,

00:38.085 --> 00:40.589
but Modesto's not really on
the way to anywhere, so--

00:40.675 --> 00:43.526
- Sit down. - No, I-I-I've got
a long drive back to L.A.

00:43.527 --> 00:45.754
This will just take a minute.

00:49.775 --> 00:50.889
You're my father.

00:52.380 --> 00:53.360
Sarah...

00:54.071 --> 00:55.562
It's not that simple.

00:56.145 --> 00:57.541
I could be your father.

00:57.542 --> 00:58.737
No, you are.

01:00.458 --> 01:01.879
You left a baseball cap at mom's.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.040
It was lousy with D.N.A., so...

01:05.600 --> 01:08.476
There's no "could be" anymore.

01:10.641 --> 01:11.536
My goodness.

01:11.537 --> 01:13.067
Listen, I-I-I didn't come up here

01:13.068 --> 01:16.538
for a big tearful family reunion.

01:16.539 --> 01:18.467
I just... I want to make it
perfectly clear to you.

01:18.468 --> 01:21.075
That there is nothing that I
want or that I need from you.

01:21.076 --> 01:22.762
Just think of me as somebody that you

01:22.763 --> 01:24.621
gave up for adoption 40 years ago,

01:24.622 --> 01:26.774
and I've had a really nice life...

01:28.385 --> 01:30.877
And I don't want to get
to know my birth parent.

01:30.878 --> 01:33.344
- Oh, please--
- Have I made myself perfectly clear?

01:33.345 --> 01:35.655
Please sit down. Let's talk.

01:35.656 --> 01:36.972
Okay, obviously I haven't,

01:36.973 --> 01:39.952
- but I'm sure it will all sink
in as soon as I leave. - Sarah--

01:39.953 --> 01:42.387
Just one more thing.
This has been enormously difficult.

01:42.388 --> 01:44.921
For my mother, so please do not call her.

01:45.151 --> 01:48.873
Do you understand?
Do not call or bother anybody in my family,

01:48.874 --> 01:52.046
because we do not want you
in our lives.

01:55.820 --> 01:56.797
Good-bye.

02:14.136 --> 02:15.955
Oh, my God. That was so surreal.

02:17.566 --> 02:20.315
Well... How did it go?

02:20.607 --> 02:22.718
He wasn't supposed
to get all teary on me.

02:22.961 --> 02:25.025
Ah. Wow. My heart is pounding.

02:28.283 --> 02:29.736
Thank you. Thanks for driving me up.

02:29.737 --> 02:30.783
Thanks for coming back.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.184
Oh, please, Sarah. I mean, come on.
I'm here for you.

02:33.185 --> 02:36.227
I-I couldn't get on a plane fast enough.

02:36.228 --> 02:37.523
I don't think I can deal with this.

02:37.524 --> 02:40.244
No, you will deal with this.
You will. Of course you will.

02:40.245 --> 02:43.331
I just feel like I'm--
like broken glass inside.

02:47.926 --> 02:51.575
♪ My Daniel is eating his carrots ♪

02:51.641 --> 02:55.485
♪ My Daniel is eating his peas ♪

02:55.532 --> 02:59.780
♪ My Daniel is eating his carrots ♪

02:59.781 --> 03:03.468
♪ So eat some more carrots for me ♪

03:03.469 --> 03:06.923
Oh! Oh, look at him.
He is so adorable.

03:06.924 --> 03:09.508
That perfect little nose--
I want to eat it right off his face.

03:09.509 --> 03:11.014
I think he's gassy.

03:11.015 --> 03:13.540
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.685
Oh, you got diapers, right?

03:14.686 --> 03:16.197
Yeah, they're in the bag
with the sippy cups.

03:16.198 --> 03:18.824
- I love when he uses his sippy cup.
- Me, too.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.692
Hi. Guys, I need to go.

03:20.693 --> 03:22.015
What? Go where?

03:22.016 --> 03:25.381
Hmm? Oh, my God.
It's Wednesday soccer practice.

03:25.382 --> 03:26.814
Uh, I have a client at 4:00.
Can you take her?

03:26.815 --> 03:28.353
No, no, no, I can't take Daniel in the car.

03:28.354 --> 03:29.852
Remember, I don't have
the right size car seat.

03:29.853 --> 03:31.216
The right one doesn't come
until tomorrow.

03:31.217 --> 03:32.069
I'll just take the bus.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.401
- No.
- You're not gonna take the bus.

03:33.402 --> 03:35.728
I took the bus lots of
times before I lived here.

03:35.729 --> 03:37.996
Well, maybe, but that was then.
This is now.

03:37.997 --> 03:40.904
- I'll just cancel my client.
- You don't need to do that.

03:40.905 --> 03:43.505
- Yes, I do.
- I'll go get my stuff.

03:47.827 --> 03:50.082
It's okay. It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.263
I know. I know.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.072
Hey, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

03:54.073 --> 03:56.564
C'est pas possible.
I know I made the reservation.

03:56.565 --> 03:58.747
What do you mean, no record?
We booked this room a month ago.

03:58.748 --> 04:00.361
We have guests coming from Paris,

04:00.362 --> 04:02.131
- from--
- Luc, I think we should call Sarah.

04:02.132 --> 04:04.385
No, no. That's the last thing
she needs right now.

04:04.386 --> 04:07.570
- You have to find those rooms, really.
I-I-- - Ms. Altamirano?

04:07.676 --> 04:10.045
There seems to be a problem
with their reservation.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.567
Justin?

04:14.568 --> 04:15.654
Tyler.

04:16.874 --> 04:17.738
How are you?

04:17.738 --> 04:19.808
Uh, I'm-- I'm great. How are you?

04:19.809 --> 04:22.251
- This is crazy. I was just thinking
about you. - You're kidding.

04:22.352 --> 04:23.864
Yeah, I was staying at
this place in the country,

04:23.865 --> 04:27.063
and they had a tree house, and
I remember the time you and I...

04:27.064 --> 04:30.013
Who could forget falling
out of a tree house naked?

04:32.521 --> 04:33.882
- Right.
- Um...

04:34.640 --> 04:35.861
Sorry. I was just out for a run.

04:35.862 --> 04:37.757
Is there a problem? I can...

04:39.050 --> 04:41.866
Um, no, it's just a big
family wedding weekend.

04:41.867 --> 04:44.152
- This is Luc. He's marrying Sarah.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.915
You, too. Well, if you
reserved a block of rooms,

04:46.916 --> 04:49.300
it's gotta be in the system somewhere.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.133
Let me go check. I'll be right back.

04:53.247 --> 04:54.277
Thank you.

04:57.848 --> 04:59.557
This girl really, really likes you.

04:59.558 --> 05:01.418
No, there is no way
she's giving me another chance,

05:01.419 --> 05:03.549
- and there is no way that girl is single.
- You never know.

05:03.550 --> 05:07.402
Just found it.
20 rooms, paid in advance.

05:07.403 --> 05:09.426
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

05:12.195 --> 05:13.903
Is there anything else I can do for you?

05:15.250 --> 05:17.595
No, no. That's, uh, that's it.

05:19.571 --> 05:20.514
It was good to see you, Justin.

05:20.515 --> 05:22.591
Very nice to see you, too, Tyler.

05:29.315 --> 05:29.854
What?

05:29.855 --> 05:32.053
You, my brother, are pitiful.

05:33.857 --> 05:34.936
Pitiful?

05:35.768 --> 05:39.238
So, um, we still haven't heard
from mom's cousin Lulu.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.846
Lulu never had any manners.
At this late date,

05:41.847 --> 05:43.357
tell the caterer
to cross her off the list.

05:43.358 --> 05:45.737
I talked to Sarah, and
she said we should set her place

05:45.738 --> 05:47.343
just in case she shows up
at the last minute.

05:47.344 --> 05:49.871
Excuse me. You talked to Sarah?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.905
Yes, I talked to Sarah.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.588
Why wouldn't I talk to Sarah?

05:55.589 --> 05:58.150
I mean, we didn't talk about Brody,
if that's what you mean.

05:58.151 --> 06:00.591
Nora, you can't keep pretending
like nothing is going on.

06:00.592 --> 06:02.815
Who's pretending?
I'm not pretending anything.

06:02.816 --> 06:04.388
Sarah doesn't want to talk about him,

06:04.389 --> 06:05.805
so I'm not gonna talk about him.

06:05.806 --> 06:08.170
- That's all.
- Okay, okay. Whatever.

06:20.759 --> 06:22.896
Oh! Saul, it's Brody.

06:22.897 --> 06:24.226
I knew it.

06:24.227 --> 06:26.529
I told Sarah she should not
have gone up there.

06:26.530 --> 06:29.774
I mean, what was the point?
Honestly, what was the point?

06:29.775 --> 06:31.591
Oh, God, Saul. What should I do?

06:31.592 --> 06:35.356
I haven't answered
his phone calls all day. I--

06:38.972 --> 06:41.143
Saul, look, you go to the door,

06:41.229 --> 06:42.015
tell him I'm not here.

06:42.016 --> 06:44.017
Are you out of your mind?
I am not gonna lie for you.

06:44.018 --> 06:46.948
- Just go and talk to him.
- I can't. I can't.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.461
I-I don't know what to say.

06:48.462 --> 06:51.353
And-- and-- and Sarah will be so upset...

06:51.354 --> 06:55.656
And... Saul, if I open that door,

06:55.657 --> 06:57.711
I don't know if I can close it again.

07:05.729 --> 07:06.686
Hello.

07:06.836 --> 07:07.623
What do you want?

07:07.624 --> 07:09.339
Can I come in? Can we talk?

07:10.017 --> 07:12.770
Brody, Sarah told you,
she doesn't want you in her life.

07:12.771 --> 07:14.729
I have to respect that.

07:15.757 --> 07:17.406
I-I can't do it, Brody.

07:17.407 --> 07:19.957
I... Please just go.

07:19.958 --> 07:22.007
Nora, we have to talk.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.489
Nora.

07:26.785 --> 07:27.921
Please.

07:31.840 --> 07:32.937
Okay.

07:34.032 --> 07:35.114
Good-bye.

07:58.737 --> 07:59.795
Poor Sarah.

07:59.893 --> 08:01.686
I mean, can you imagine
what she's going through?

08:01.687 --> 08:02.823
She's tough. She can handle it.

08:02.824 --> 08:05.666
I don't know. You should've heard her
on the phone when she called me.

08:06.070 --> 08:09.362
Yes. Oh, yes.
You know, Aunt Kitty took the red-eye,

08:09.363 --> 08:11.713
and Aunt Kitty does not do red-eyes.

08:11.854 --> 08:14.025
And Aunt Kitty doesn't
normally leave her son.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.371
All the way back east
with her boyfriend.

08:16.372 --> 08:19.512
That is how worried Aunt Kitty is.
Look at you.

08:19.513 --> 08:21.441
I know. I know. I hear you.

08:21.442 --> 08:22.975
Could you be any cuter?

08:22.976 --> 08:24.869
No. I mean, every time I look at him,

08:24.870 --> 08:28.145
my heart literally wants to
jump out of my chest with love.

08:31.663 --> 08:33.095
Looks like Scotty.

08:34.111 --> 08:35.784
- Sorry.
- Oh, shut up.

08:37.202 --> 08:38.124
You know, I thought I'd feel weird

08:38.125 --> 08:39.654
about not being the bio dad.

08:39.655 --> 08:41.705
- I totally feel like his father.
- Mm.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.414
I mean, not that I need to tell you that.

08:43.416 --> 08:46.396
No. I was so meant to be Evan's mother.

08:47.539 --> 08:49.529
You see? It's all about love.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.550
I wish Sarah could see it that way.

08:53.582 --> 08:56.224
Okay. Okay. Go see your daddy.

08:57.098 --> 08:58.733
You take care of Daniel.

08:59.055 --> 09:01.664
And I am gonna go take care of Sarah.

09:01.665 --> 09:02.941
- Wave bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

09:02.942 --> 09:05.421
Wave bye-bye. Bye, Aunt Kitty.

09:09.894 --> 09:10.876
Look at this.

09:14.064 --> 09:14.985
Hello.

09:14.986 --> 09:17.650
- We are here for a marriage license.
- Mm-hmm.

09:17.651 --> 09:19.064
Fill this out and bring
it right back to me.

09:19.065 --> 09:20.017
You got it?

09:20.500 --> 09:23.499
Okay. Whoops. All right.

09:23.572 --> 09:26.074
"Current address, date of birth...

09:27.209 --> 09:28.584
Current last name."

09:29.326 --> 09:30.331
They really should make
that multiple choice.

09:30.332 --> 09:32.284
It will be Laurent anyway, so...

09:32.523 --> 09:34.874
Who knew filling out a form
could be this much fun?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.121
"Last name at birth."

09:36.122 --> 09:37.600
Do you think they mean
the birth certificate.

09:37.601 --> 09:38.876
That my father refused to sign.

09:38.877 --> 09:40.999
Or the one he finally did sign
after he realized

09:41.000 --> 09:43.135
- that Brody was out of the picture?
- Are you okay?

09:43.136 --> 09:45.963
Oh, boy. This is the gift
that keeps on giving.

09:46.122 --> 09:47.807
"Father's full name."

09:47.994 --> 09:50.513
See, people ask,
"what is the definition of irony?"

09:50.567 --> 09:51.700
It's right here.

09:53.424 --> 09:56.652
So we're gonna put Cooper, Paige,
and Olivia at this table.

09:56.653 --> 09:57.588
Right.

09:58.184 --> 09:59.887
- Wow. Oh, God.
- What?

09:59.888 --> 10:02.080
Nothing. I remember when
we were all at the kids' table.

10:02.081 --> 10:04.022
Well, it's a brave new world.

10:04.023 --> 10:06.282
Yep, I'll say it is,
in more ways than one.

10:06.283 --> 10:08.394
Saul, please don't start.

10:08.395 --> 10:09.448
Okay, okay.

10:09.449 --> 10:13.108
Look, mom... just because
Sarah doesn't want to see him.

10:13.109 --> 10:14.805
- doesn't mean that you--
- Yes, it does.

10:14.806 --> 10:16.888
You don't understand because
you don't have children.

10:16.889 --> 10:19.672
Fine. So we don't have children,
but we've both been in love.

10:19.673 --> 10:21.301
All right, look, Nora,
I-I just want to say something,

10:21.302 --> 10:22.957
and please don't yell at me.

10:23.369 --> 10:25.860
I know this is a difficult
situation for you, but-- but--

10:25.861 --> 10:29.173
Yes, it is a difficult situation.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.239
It's difficult...

10:32.843 --> 10:34.149
Now, but...

10:36.144 --> 10:38.145
There was this one little moment in time.

10:38.146 --> 10:40.109
When it all could've been so simple.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.961
I was almost 19 years old.

10:42.962 --> 10:45.287
I was a freshman in college.

10:52.071 --> 10:53.007
Brody.

10:53.011 --> 10:54.027
Hey.

10:54.603 --> 10:56.168
Still think you're gonna
get her running, huh?

10:56.169 --> 10:58.120
Moses parted the red sea.

10:59.335 --> 11:02.446
Anyway, it better.
I'm heading South in a couple of weeks.

11:03.735 --> 11:04.783
Okay.

11:05.401 --> 11:06.439
Watch...

11:06.440 --> 11:07.528
And learn.

11:16.936 --> 11:19.071
Well, I don't want to stand
in the way of any miracles.

11:19.072 --> 11:22.106
No. I'm glad you came, slugger.

11:22.923 --> 11:24.056
I hate when you call me that.

11:24.057 --> 11:25.076
I know.

11:27.392 --> 11:30.826
Well, let me get changed,
and we can go grab a bite.

11:30.827 --> 11:32.757
No, I really should go.

11:35.755 --> 11:37.205
I just came to tell you...

11:39.403 --> 11:40.688
William Walker, he, um--

11:40.689 --> 11:41.603
Let me guess.

11:41.604 --> 11:42.666
He wants to take you

11:42.667 --> 11:44.810
to the Richard Nixon rally downtown.

11:44.811 --> 11:48.092
No. He asked me to marry him.

11:53.073 --> 11:54.075
Wow.

11:56.313 --> 11:57.258
Wow?

11:58.894 --> 12:00.180
That's it? Wow?

12:00.974 --> 12:02.322
What do you want me to say?

12:13.460 --> 12:15.250
Nothing, I guess.

12:17.352 --> 12:18.740
Just get back to the car.

12:19.812 --> 12:21.689
I can't believe you never told me that.

12:24.332 --> 12:26.892
So you woulda married Brody if...

12:30.992 --> 12:31.975
Nora.

12:33.851 --> 12:35.250
I have something for you.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.357
I was saving this for your birthday,

12:48.358 --> 12:52.280
but... since I probably
won't be seeing you--

12:57.444 --> 12:59.670
Brody, it's beautiful.

13:00.465 --> 13:02.052
My grandpa gave that to my grandma

13:02.053 --> 13:05.193
- on the day they left Ireland.
- Are you serious?

13:05.194 --> 13:06.220
No.

13:07.559 --> 13:10.644
My bet is, she just picked it up
in a gift shop in Reno.

13:14.619 --> 13:15.574
Go on.

13:16.081 --> 13:17.102
Take it.

13:21.055 --> 13:22.333
So, uh...

13:23.619 --> 13:25.447
I guess this is a good-bye present.

13:27.256 --> 13:28.785
So you won't forget me.

13:29.369 --> 13:30.718
Do you think...

13:32.180 --> 13:34.882
I could ever forget you, Nicholas Brody?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.999
Oh. Brody.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.291
Hey.

14:15.292 --> 14:16.957
What are you doing here?
Are you stalking me?

14:16.958 --> 14:18.517
Well, I think I was here
before you were.

14:18.518 --> 14:20.280
That'd be some pretty fancy stalking.

14:20.281 --> 14:22.207
Oh, no. I mean, honestly,

14:22.208 --> 14:24.761
what are the chances of me
running into you like this?

14:24.762 --> 14:26.326
I never come here. Not ever.

14:26.327 --> 14:29.153
Maybe we were meant to run
into each other like this.

14:29.501 --> 14:33.056
You know, destiny, that kind of stuff.

14:33.111 --> 14:34.481
Destiny my foot.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.581
It's a random universe.

14:36.804 --> 14:38.967
Well, then I hope I see you
around sometime.

14:43.406 --> 14:44.939
Did you ever get that car fixed?

14:44.940 --> 14:47.091
- What car?
- That big ol' station wagon

14:47.092 --> 14:49.764
you were fixing up to
drive down to Florida.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.005
No. No, I had to take a bus.

14:52.822 --> 14:55.843
Maybe the universe was trying
to tell me something then, too.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.835
Come over tonight, around 7:00.

15:17.868 --> 15:18.555
Whiskey.

15:18.556 --> 15:21.293
Oh, hey. No, no, no.
Wait, guys, guys, the bar--

15:21.294 --> 15:23.279
Plenty of time for that later. All right.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.481
Let's check in.

15:25.334 --> 15:27.285
Hello again. How are you?

15:27.286 --> 15:30.427
We have three rooms under
the Walker-Laurent block.

15:30.949 --> 15:32.007
Thank you.

15:32.362 --> 15:33.861
Mademoiselle...

15:35.176 --> 15:37.441
Whoa. Hey. All right. Hey, Pierre.

15:37.442 --> 15:40.142
Let's, uh, try and avoid an
international incident here.

15:40.143 --> 15:42.073
Hello. How are you? Okay.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.335
Very sweet, Pierre. All right.
Let's go. Here we go.

15:44.336 --> 15:46.805
Here you go, gentlemen.
You are all on the fifth floor.

15:46.806 --> 15:48.614
- Fifth floor. Fifth floor.
- Fifth floor.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.691
- Cinq, right? Cinq.
- Fifth floor.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.964
All right. Thank you. Sorry.

15:53.018 --> 15:53.914
All right.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.187
Whoa.

15:55.641 --> 15:59.045
Nothing for, uh, five years
and twice in the same week.

15:59.142 --> 16:00.817
Well, I do work here.

16:00.818 --> 16:01.899
Right.

16:02.558 --> 16:03.656
Excuse moi.

16:04.117 --> 16:06.145
- Vous êtes déjà a Paris?
- Hmm?

16:06.647 --> 16:10.116
Okay. All right. That's enough.
All right. Come on, Pierre.

16:10.117 --> 16:12.463
Nice kiss. Mm. I love you.

16:12.464 --> 16:14.437
Yeah, yeah. All right. All right.

16:14.928 --> 16:17.297
I'm sorry. Those are Luc's cousins.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.067
Si vous avez besoin de que ce soir,

16:20.068 --> 16:21.655
demandez au concierge.

16:21.656 --> 16:22.979
Je demande a toi.

16:24.909 --> 16:25.861
Whoa.

16:26.165 --> 16:27.611
You, uh, you speak French?

16:27.612 --> 16:30.326
And a little Spanish.
In my line of work, it helps.

16:31.289 --> 16:33.941
Oh. Nice of you to see them
through the wilds of Pasadena.

16:33.942 --> 16:35.950
They seem like
they'd be lost on their own.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.461
Is it that obvious
that I came to see you?

16:39.730 --> 16:41.074
It's pretty obvious.

16:42.921 --> 16:44.153
Look, Tyler, I'm...

16:44.154 --> 16:45.405
I'm not the same guy I was.

16:45.406 --> 16:48.271
- I'm sober three years now, and I--
- Justin, you don't have to--

16:48.272 --> 16:49.487
No, no, I do.

16:50.602 --> 16:51.655
I'm sorry.

16:52.999 --> 16:55.748
I'm sorry how things ended.
I'm sorry that they ended.

16:55.749 --> 16:56.808
I-I made mistakes.

16:56.809 --> 17:00.705
And I'd really love a chance
to make it up to you.

17:01.347 --> 17:02.428
What do you mean?

17:02.476 --> 17:05.990
Uh, I'd love to take you on
a-a date or dinner, coffee,

17:05.991 --> 17:08.891
or-- or something, just to
show you who I am now.

17:10.359 --> 17:11.950
I don't think that's a good idea.

17:15.974 --> 17:16.943
Okay.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.230
You know, I, um--

17:23.256 --> 17:24.560
I was gonna have them take a cab,

17:24.560 --> 17:26.788
but I heard a story today
that made me realize.

17:26.789 --> 17:29.588
It was important to say
what I feel, so that...

17:30.267 --> 17:33.237
I'm sorry, and, uh,
it was really great to see you again.

17:35.454 --> 17:36.491
Drinks?

17:36.888 --> 17:39.656
Or whatever you're drinking
now that you're not drinking?

17:40.629 --> 17:41.279
Uh, when?

17:41.280 --> 17:43.711
Tonight. I get off late,
but I can meet you somewhere.

17:44.379 --> 17:45.683
I have a bachelor party to go to,

17:45.684 --> 17:48.874
so late is-- great.

17:49.384 --> 17:50.336
Great.

17:51.182 --> 17:53.505
All right. I'm gonna-- bye.

17:58.734 --> 18:01.250
Olivia, what were you thinking?
This isn't like you.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.556
You intentionally knocked
over someone's food tray?

18:03.557 --> 18:05.049
She wouldn't let me sit
at their table.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.615
So you knocked over her food?

18:08.509 --> 18:09.552
Okay.

18:09.862 --> 18:12.254
So what are we gonna do about this?

18:13.016 --> 18:14.993
So that it doesn't happen again.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.124
I don't know.

18:17.324 --> 18:21.133
Okay. No cell phone,
no video games for a week.

18:25.046 --> 18:26.009
Okay.

18:28.245 --> 18:30.624
Olivia, I-I know this is a
confusing time for you.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.581
It's confusing for all of us.

18:32.795 --> 18:34.480
None of us were expecting
Daniel in our lives.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.771
But if you feel like you
need more attention,

18:37.005 --> 18:38.699
this is not the way to go
about getting it.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.492
You need to sign it so
I can bring it back to my teacher.

18:47.630 --> 18:49.863
Oh! Olivia, be careful!

18:52.148 --> 18:53.592
I will deal with that.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.007
Sorry.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.017
Don't swing your bag like that.
Pick it up.

18:58.018 --> 18:59.382
You pick it up.

19:01.501 --> 19:03.162
- Sometimes they taste like the ones that come
out of the-- - No, for the kids, the kids.

19:03.163 --> 19:04.941
- The kids have to have the fingerling
potatoes. - No, no, no, they're for everybody,

19:04.942 --> 19:06.611
but sometimes they taste
like they come from

19:06.612 --> 19:08.332
- a can-- - But it's good for the kids.
It's good for the kids--

19:08.333 --> 19:10.858
Look, maybe we should just
reconsider the whole menu,

19:10.859 --> 19:12.932
because if we follow the octopus salad

19:12.933 --> 19:16.293
- with the salmon, it's gonna feel like a--
like a-- - Like what?

19:16.294 --> 19:18.867
Like a shark designed the menu.

19:19.328 --> 19:22.198
Okay, okay, I-I see your point.

19:22.199 --> 19:23.590
Let's add steak.

19:23.591 --> 19:25.038
- I don't like--
- No, lamb, lamb.

19:25.039 --> 19:29.189
- Sharks hate lamb.
- What? Honey, Sarah, honestly, sweetheart,

19:29.190 --> 19:31.308
we can't change the menu now.

19:31.309 --> 19:33.093
For heaven sakes,
they caught the fish already.

19:33.094 --> 19:35.703
Mom, if Sarah wants to change the menu,

19:35.704 --> 19:37.678
we will change the menu.
It's her wedding.

19:37.679 --> 19:40.788
It has to be exactly the way she wants it.
Lamb is on the menu.

19:40.789 --> 19:43.106
Okay, fine. Lamb will be on the menu.

19:43.107 --> 19:45.015
Why do you keep checking your watch?

19:45.016 --> 19:47.512
I-I mean, do you not want to be here?
Are we boring you?

19:47.513 --> 19:50.922
No, it's just getting late,
and I should be getting home.

19:50.923 --> 19:54.312
- Do you have plans? We were just about
to order thai. - Oh, thai.

19:54.434 --> 19:56.859
Thai. I'm gonna get the--
I'm gonna get the menus.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.714
No, I'm-- I'm-- I'm, you know,

19:58.715 --> 20:00.751
- tired. We're all tired.
- I'm not tired.

20:00.752 --> 20:04.480
I'm not tired.
We went up to Modesto yesterday.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.524
I know that, Sarah.

20:07.853 --> 20:09.181
I needed closure, mom.

20:09.182 --> 20:11.882
- Uh-huh. - I needed to make
it perfectly clear to him

20:11.883 --> 20:13.925
that he has to leave all of us alone.

20:13.926 --> 20:16.182
Yeah, well, maybe you just stirred the pot.

20:16.371 --> 20:17.317
Why would you say that?

20:17.318 --> 20:20.247
Sarah, you-- you told me
not to talk about Brody.

20:20.277 --> 20:22.165
I'm not, and you are.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.973
Okay. Okay, guys, you know what? Stop.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.938
- We are planning Sarah's wedding.
- Yes.

20:25.939 --> 20:29.270
- And we should be enjoying every
single minute of it. - Absolutely.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.768
- I know. I know.
- All right, we're getting the wonton soup.

20:31.885 --> 20:35.020
- Fine. - Why didn't anybody plan
me a bachelorette party?

20:35.021 --> 20:38.343
Sarah. Sarah, come on. Please. This is fun.

20:38.344 --> 20:40.921
We are planning your wedding.
We're about to do the playlist.

20:40.922 --> 20:43.279
No. No, no, no.
I'm going stir crazy in here.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.445
I've gotta get out.

20:44.446 --> 20:46.861
Okay. Okay, fine. We'll--

20:46.929 --> 20:49.911
L-let's go get a drink-- a-a real drink.

20:50.899 --> 20:52.821
Oh, you know what would be really fun?

20:53.048 --> 20:56.088
If we crashed Luc's bachelor party.

20:56.174 --> 20:58.554
Oh, yeah. I'm sure
he would just love that.

20:58.555 --> 21:01.711
That is an absolute brilliant idea.

21:01.712 --> 21:04.065
Right? We could make sure
that he doesn't end up

21:04.066 --> 21:06.074
- with a stripper.
- Great. You know what?

21:06.075 --> 21:08.058
I am gonna go up.
I'm gonna raid your closet.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.528
- I'm gonna drive, so perfect.
- Perfect.

21:10.529 --> 21:13.350
Well, good.
Then you two lovely young women

21:13.351 --> 21:16.364
have a wonderful time,
and I will, you know,

21:16.365 --> 21:18.736
just call you in the morning.

21:18.737 --> 21:20.828
Mom, you seem like
you're in a terrible rush

21:20.829 --> 21:21.932
to get out of here.

21:21.933 --> 21:23.312
- Are--
- No.

21:23.313 --> 21:26.337
No, no, I'm not in a terrible rush.
I'm just leaving.

21:26.531 --> 21:28.783
Are you sure Brody didn't
try to talk to you?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.930
All right, Sarah, look,

21:33.373 --> 21:35.444
he-- he came to the house last night.

21:35.445 --> 21:36.527
- But I didn't let him in.
- God,

21:36.528 --> 21:39.296
I specifically told him not
to bother you anymore.

21:39.297 --> 21:42.295
Sarah, Brody and I have a history together,

21:42.296 --> 21:43.603
which includes you.

21:43.604 --> 21:46.342
- Is he planning to see you again?
- I don't know what he's planning.

21:46.407 --> 21:48.395
Okay, sorry. Let me rephrase that.

21:49.032 --> 21:50.760
Are you planning to see him?

21:51.357 --> 21:53.790
Because if you are,
I-I would like to know.

21:54.887 --> 21:56.599
I'm not doing anything.

21:56.630 --> 21:58.706
Honey, I know this is complicated for you,

21:58.707 --> 22:00.174
but it's complicated for me, too.

22:00.175 --> 22:02.065
Is it? Because I thought
he got you pregnant.

22:02.066 --> 22:03.428
Then abandoned you to play baseball.

22:03.429 --> 22:06.740
I mean, why would you want a
person like that in your life,

22:06.741 --> 22:07.988
right?

22:09.634 --> 22:10.754
I don't know.

22:12.014 --> 22:13.029
Because, mom,

22:13.030 --> 22:15.034
if-- if you were to choose him over me,

22:15.035 --> 22:17.724
honestly, I don't know what I'd do.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.577
I would never do that, Sarah, not ever.

22:24.972 --> 22:26.331
Have fun tonight.

22:27.496 --> 22:28.952
Thanks, mom.

22:55.316 --> 22:56.421
What did he say?

22:57.246 --> 22:58.668
He said that you're very intelligent.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.261
And he would love to know you better.

23:00.262 --> 23:01.225
- Aww.
- Yeah.

23:01.226 --> 23:04.352
Actually, he said he wants to
ravage her body all night long.

23:04.353 --> 23:06.125
Ah, sex. Those were the days.

23:06.126 --> 23:09.776
I don't understand.
Sarah's not answering any of my texts.

23:09.777 --> 23:11.125
Well, I think she's doing pretty well,

23:11.126 --> 23:12.802
considering the circumstances.

23:12.803 --> 23:17.056
Oh, finally.
Olivia and Daniel are asleep.

23:17.057 --> 23:18.336
Kevin, why don't you go home?

23:18.872 --> 23:20.272
I'm only doing this for them.

23:20.273 --> 23:23.606
- Hey, hey, ma chérie. Hey.
- All right. Check this one out.

23:23.607 --> 23:25.027
Look how beautiful she is.

23:33.447 --> 23:35.320
Ah, they want to go to a gentlemen club.

23:35.321 --> 23:37.231
There's a bar down the block.
It'll be full of gentlemen.

23:37.232 --> 23:39.021
No, no, no, no.
They want to go to a strip club.

23:39.022 --> 23:39.902
I know. Okay.

23:39.903 --> 23:43.068
- Oh, no. - What, did you accidentally
delete a picture of Tyler?

23:43.069 --> 23:44.566
No. She texted. She's not coming.

23:44.567 --> 23:47.260
Well, why don't you go and see
strippers with, uh, with Luc?

23:47.261 --> 23:49.352
- I'm exhausted.
- I don't want to see any strippers.

23:49.353 --> 23:51.831
- Yeah, neither do I.
- What's the big deal with this girl?

23:51.832 --> 23:53.824
- You re-met her like a day ago.
- The big deal was,

23:53.825 --> 23:55.445
I was in love with her, all right?

23:55.446 --> 23:57.078
And when I saw her again, it--

24:00.742 --> 24:02.499
You know what? Whatever.
I'm going to see strippers.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.244
They'll understand.

24:03.245 --> 24:04.365
Luc, let's go.

24:04.539 --> 24:08.460
Hi. What? When?

24:08.816 --> 24:10.448
No, no, no, no. I'll meet you there.

24:12.726 --> 24:13.863
Olivia just, uh,

24:13.864 --> 24:17.479
she just showed up at her old group home.

24:18.509 --> 24:20.606
She-- she snuck out. She ran away.

24:24.698 --> 24:25.592
Come in, come in, come in, come in.

24:25.593 --> 24:27.360
What are you doing? I--

24:27.361 --> 24:29.568
I parked my R.V. around the corner.

24:29.985 --> 24:32.161
I just don't want anyone to see us.

24:32.490 --> 24:33.804
Oh, this is crazy.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.765
Brody, we can't start
sneaking around like this.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.805
I lied to my daughter today--

24:40.301 --> 24:42.596
To our daughter, and
I don't want to do that.

24:42.597 --> 24:45.392
- Brought you some doughnuts.
- Doughnuts?

24:45.393 --> 24:47.393
Don't you still like the
little powdery ones?

24:49.154 --> 24:51.827
Yeah. I-I try never to eat doughnuts,

24:51.828 --> 24:54.469
mainly because I don't want
to end up looking like one.

24:55.762 --> 24:56.979
You don't.

24:57.987 --> 24:59.107
Brody--

24:59.890 --> 25:00.914
Nora--

25:01.994 --> 25:04.409
We all need some time. That's all.

25:07.855 --> 25:09.230
Just a little time.

25:12.778 --> 25:13.894
I think we need to figure out

25:13.895 --> 25:15.337
how to say good-bye to each other.

25:16.979 --> 25:18.321
Is that what you want?

25:19.721 --> 25:22.330
- Oh, God.
- Where are you going?

25:23.011 --> 25:24.355
To fix us a drink.

25:27.024 --> 25:30.298
- I.D.s. - Okay, we are rocking
this club like we never left.

25:30.299 --> 25:31.564
Oh, yeah. We're gonna leave

25:31.565 --> 25:35.485
these wannabe "gen-z" hipsters in the dust.

25:35.486 --> 25:36.649
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:36.650 --> 25:37.931
I.D.s.

25:38.324 --> 25:41.488
Oh, way to go. Okay, score, baby.

25:41.489 --> 25:42.559
Thank you. That's funny.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.617
You know, when I show you this,
you probably will faint.

25:48.569 --> 25:50.299
- What's wrong?
- Oh, shoot.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.212
I think I left it at the
county clerk's office.

25:53.561 --> 25:55.065
Sorry, I don't have it.

25:55.563 --> 25:57.114
No I.D., no entrance.

25:57.233 --> 25:59.962
Okay, honestly, uh, I may not look it,

25:59.963 --> 26:01.742
but I'm old enough to be your mother.

26:01.743 --> 26:03.482
- It's true.
- Quiz me on the '70s.

26:03.483 --> 26:06.073
- Sorry, it's policy.
- Okay.

26:06.258 --> 26:08.964
Okay, maybe you could bend
your policy for one night.

26:08.965 --> 26:09.946
I mean, clearly--

26:09.947 --> 26:12.435
Listen, my-- my, um, fiancé's
actually in there--

26:12.436 --> 26:14.790
- Yeah. - Having his stag party,
and we're gonna crash it.

26:14.791 --> 26:15.404
So if you could just let us in-- ladies,

26:15.405 --> 26:17.094
if you don't have your I.D.s,

26:17.095 --> 26:19.960
- could you please step aside?
- Why are you being so mean?

26:19.961 --> 26:22.299
Uh, no. No, he's not being mean.
He's just doing his job.

26:22.300 --> 26:23.999
- Sorry, ladies. Rules are rules.
- Do you know what?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.570
Excuse me, ladies. Screw your rules.

26:25.571 --> 26:28.082
- Sarah-- - You know-- you know
the ironic part of this,

26:28.083 --> 26:30.290
if I had my I.D. on me,

26:30.291 --> 26:31.903
- issued by the state of California--
- Sarah.

26:31.904 --> 26:33.374
- It would be a fake.
- Oh, no. Sorry. Sarah, Sarah--

26:33.375 --> 26:35.631
Because it would say that
my name is Sarah Walker,

26:35.632 --> 26:37.427
which it's really not.

26:37.428 --> 26:39.631
- I mean, that may not be who I am.
- Relax.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.672
Sit down over here and relax. Sarah--
- How can I relax?

26:42.673 --> 26:45.549
How can I relax when everywhere
I go in this whole world,

26:45.550 --> 26:47.437
everybody wants me to
prove to them who I am?

26:47.438 --> 26:48.853
Nobody wants you to prove who you are.

26:48.854 --> 26:49.915
Y-you know who you are.
That's all that matters.

26:49.916 --> 26:51.392
No, I don't. I don't.
That's the whole point.

26:51.393 --> 26:53.582
I have no idea who I am.
Do you know what it's like to

26:53.583 --> 26:56.102
wake up one morning and
realize that your entire life

26:56.103 --> 26:57.497
is built on a lie?

26:57.498 --> 26:59.498
I think dad knew that I wasn't his.

26:59.685 --> 27:00.485
Oh, Sarah.
Sarah, what are you talking about?

27:00.486 --> 27:03.375
No. I'm serious.
I think that's why he left me Ojai foods.

27:03.376 --> 27:05.540
He was-- he was clearly overcompensating.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.302
And wanted to prove to
himself that he loved me

27:07.303 --> 27:11.401
- despite knowing who I was.
- No, Sarah, he left you Ojai foods

27:11.402 --> 27:13.579
because he knows you know
how to run a business.

27:13.699 --> 27:16.421
I'm not a Walker. There I said it.

27:16.422 --> 27:18.443
It's like the weirdest thing I ever said.

27:18.444 --> 27:20.818
I'm not a Walker. You're not my sister.

27:20.819 --> 27:23.078
You're my half sister. This is--

27:23.079 --> 27:25.448
Really? Really?
I'm not your sister? Okay, so--

27:25.511 --> 27:27.812
So I guess then that
it wasn't you and me

27:27.813 --> 27:30.554
who founded the I hate boys
club of greater Pasadena

27:30.555 --> 27:31.552
and swore with blood.

27:31.553 --> 27:33.365
That we would never kiss a
boy in our entire lives.

27:33.366 --> 27:36.326
And-- and I guess it wasn't
you who stole dad's car

27:36.327 --> 27:37.935
and went out to meet Michael Klesko

27:37.936 --> 27:40.120
and ran out of gas on Ventura Boulevard.

27:40.140 --> 27:43.155
And I guess it wasn't me
who-- who bicycled out there

27:43.156 --> 27:44.519
in the middle of the night with a gas can.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.167
And I guess it wasn't you who
held my hair out of my face

27:47.168 --> 27:48.398
when I was puking up after chemo,

27:48.399 --> 27:50.493
telling me that you loved
me, telling me that

27:50.494 --> 27:53.497
everything was gonna be okay
and-- and saving my life.

27:53.498 --> 27:55.544
That wasn't you? You know what?

27:55.545 --> 27:58.776
Maybe it was you, Sarah.
Maybe it was just half of you.

28:00.493 --> 28:01.619
I'm sorry, Kitty.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.925
This one, you can't understand.

28:04.244 --> 28:05.333
Sarah.

28:05.551 --> 28:06.711
Oh, Sarah, where are you going?

28:06.712 --> 28:09.481
- I'm gonna get a cab.
- What do you mean, get a cab? You can't--

28:09.845 --> 28:11.140
Sarah.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.531
How did you even get here?

28:22.945 --> 28:24.352
I took the bus.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.545
Alone at night?

28:26.546 --> 28:28.867
I told you, I used to do it all the time.

28:30.219 --> 28:32.762
Olivia, that does not make me feel better.

28:38.996 --> 28:41.050
Olivia, thank God you are okay.

28:41.051 --> 28:43.017
I was worried sick about you.

28:44.328 --> 28:45.117
Is she all right?

28:45.118 --> 28:46.366
Yeah, I think so.

28:47.460 --> 28:48.998
- So who's with Daniel?
- Uncle Saul,

28:48.999 --> 28:50.192
but that doesn't matter right now.

28:50.193 --> 28:52.130
What matters right now is you.

28:54.236 --> 28:57.139
Olivia, you are never, ever

28:57.140 --> 28:58.735
to leave the house
without letting us know

28:58.736 --> 29:01.792
where you are going, ever.
Is that clear?

29:03.421 --> 29:04.975
Okay, sweetheart,

29:05.962 --> 29:07.716
we know things have been crazy at home,

29:07.717 --> 29:08.898
and that hasn't been fair to you,

29:08.899 --> 29:10.554
but we're gonna solve this problem,

29:10.555 --> 29:12.685
but we're gonna solve it as a family.

29:13.623 --> 29:15.930
You are as important to us as Daniel.

29:15.931 --> 29:17.172
- Do you understand that?
- Why?

29:17.173 --> 29:19.586
He was your first choice,
and now you have him.

29:19.587 --> 29:21.221
But we found you.

29:21.381 --> 29:24.851
Somehow life brought all four us together,

29:25.120 --> 29:26.242
and that is not gonna change.

29:26.243 --> 29:28.162
But you don't need me anymore.

29:28.368 --> 29:33.045
Hey, Olivia, I think
we need you more than ever.

29:33.046 --> 29:35.136
- Yeah. - 'Cause, you know, the
thing about Daniel is,

29:35.137 --> 29:38.390
he is in a brand-new home,
sleeping in a brand-new bed,

29:38.391 --> 29:40.200
meeting all these new people.

29:40.919 --> 29:42.485
Does that remind you of anyone?

29:43.301 --> 29:45.661
You're the only one who
really knows how he feels.

29:46.335 --> 29:50.703
So-- help us show him
that we're his family.

29:50.704 --> 29:52.856
And that we're not going anywhere--

29:53.346 --> 29:54.655
Ever.

29:56.537 --> 29:58.008
Do you think you can do that?

30:03.564 --> 30:05.510
Oh. No, Brody. It's just a mess--

30:05.511 --> 30:07.397
A-a-a great big, unfixable mess.

30:07.398 --> 30:09.944
Nora, Nora, there's things
you don't understand

30:09.945 --> 30:11.489
about what happened in the hospital.

30:11.490 --> 30:13.015
Of course I understand.

30:13.016 --> 30:15.469
You came to my room and you lied to me.

30:15.470 --> 30:17.541
- So I could be the very respectable...
- No.

30:17.542 --> 30:19.913
- Mrs. William Walker.
- No, no. I came to tell you the truth.

30:19.914 --> 30:22.253
- Well, then why didn't you?!
- Because I was a scared kid!

30:22.254 --> 30:23.835
You looked at me and my baby
and you ran!

30:23.836 --> 30:26.436
And Bill-- Bill-- he twisted
things around in my head.

30:26.437 --> 30:28.037
What did he twist?

30:29.878 --> 30:31.413
I was in Florida

30:31.651 --> 30:33.659
trying to be a better
ball player than I was,

30:34.013 --> 30:35.976
and I got a call
from Bill Walker.

30:37.006 --> 30:39.408
Somehow I drove
from Sarasota to Pasadena

30:40.160 --> 30:41.413
in 48 hours flat.

30:49.377 --> 30:50.843
Which one's yours?

30:51.783 --> 30:52.909
I don't know.

30:57.832 --> 30:58.968
Hello, Bill.

30:59.279 --> 31:00.480
Brody.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.773
Ah, there she goes.

31:02.882 --> 31:04.760
Off to her 9:30 feeding.

31:05.174 --> 31:06.449
Sarah Walker.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.430
I think she has my mother's eyes.

31:10.496 --> 31:12.033
But who knows?
Maybe they're your mother's.

31:12.142 --> 31:14.095
It's a little hard to tell
at this age, isn't it?

31:14.238 --> 31:17.738
Well, is that the only way we're
gonna be able to find out,

31:18.092 --> 31:18.775
her eyes?

31:19.477 --> 31:20.975
Because we do have
a problem then.

31:21.406 --> 31:24.150
No.
There are better ways.

31:25.940 --> 31:27.129
What's your blood type?

31:27.960 --> 31:28.666
B.

31:32.351 --> 31:33.461
Well, then we do
have a problem,

31:34.520 --> 31:35.476
because so am I,

31:36.060 --> 31:38.310
and Sarah's AB,
compatible with both of us.

31:39.418 --> 31:41.055
If there's a chance
that's my little girl,

31:41.156 --> 31:43.445
I'm not gonna just walk away.

31:43.576 --> 31:44.860
And how exactly
would that work,

31:45.290 --> 31:48.790
we all raise her together,
some kind of hippie commune?

31:48.791 --> 31:49.878
I want to see Nora.

31:50.835 --> 31:52.510
- Tell me what room she's in.
- I'll tell you.

31:53.126 --> 31:55.592
But before you go in there
and claim your 50% chance,

31:56.586 --> 31:58.564
think about a couple of things.

31:59.448 --> 32:00.941
Do you really want to leave
that little girl

32:01.237 --> 32:04.037
never knowing for sure
who her daddy is?

32:04.223 --> 32:06.431
Even if there were some
magic way to prove it was you,

32:06.808 --> 32:09.608
what kind of life
could you give her?

32:09.895 --> 32:12.695
You're on the road,
following a dream.

32:13.809 --> 32:15.837
I'm building a business...

32:15.907 --> 32:18.707
A real business
that'll be Sarah's one day.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.054
You want to take that
away from her?

32:23.458 --> 32:24.803
She married me, Brody.

32:26.124 --> 32:26.834
I'm the one she wanted.

32:26.973 --> 32:30.006
She came to me the day you
proposed, hoping I'd stop her.

32:30.069 --> 32:30.850
But you didn't.

32:33.158 --> 32:34.644
Do you know why she told me
about that day

32:34.930 --> 32:36.867
an hour after Sarah was born?

32:37.235 --> 32:38.972
Because she considered it
a mistake--

32:39.107 --> 32:41.301
Such a huge mistake

32:41.301 --> 32:43.081
that she had to tell
her husband the truth.

32:45.484 --> 32:47.425
You don't lie to the people
you love, Brody.

32:51.609 --> 32:52.882
You want to do the right thing?

32:53.694 --> 32:54.607
Go in there

32:55.391 --> 32:57.930
and tell her there's no way
you could be Sarah's father.

32:59.970 --> 33:01.901
Tell her your blood type is O.

33:03.927 --> 33:05.744
Room 317.

33:06.729 --> 33:08.829
Just past the nurses' station.

33:10.329 --> 33:11.465
If I had done
the right thing that day,

33:13.990 --> 33:17.330
you wouldn't even be here.

33:44.103 --> 33:45.603
Nora.

33:47.890 --> 33:48.854
Brody.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.460
She is beautiful.

33:57.476 --> 33:58.890
William called you, huh?

34:00.652 --> 34:01.435
He's pretty angry.

34:01.696 --> 34:03.128
I bet.

34:11.089 --> 34:13.723
Why did you tell him about us?

34:14.853 --> 34:17.531
He's my husband.
He deserves to know the truth.

34:21.099 --> 34:22.009
How's baseball going?

34:25.274 --> 34:26.393
Okay.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.532
I'm still with the farm team,

34:29.900 --> 34:31.795
and they seem to be liking me.

34:33.188 --> 34:35.588
So it's a dream come true
then, huh?

34:38.473 --> 34:39.091
Yeah.

34:39.369 --> 34:40.489
Yeah, it is.

34:44.402 --> 34:46.012
I'm so happy for you then.

34:52.411 --> 34:54.231
Do you love him?

34:57.323 --> 34:58.781
William?

35:03.923 --> 35:05.630
Yes, of course I do.

35:11.132 --> 35:12.202
I had to say that.

35:12.202 --> 35:14.022
I didn't have a choice.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.623
Why?

35:15.690 --> 35:16.596
Because William said

35:16.914 --> 35:19.472
if I didn't send you away
and out of my life,

35:19.551 --> 35:21.462
he wouldn't sign
the birth certificate...

35:21.932 --> 35:25.335
And he would leave me
and my baby girl all on our own.

35:25.361 --> 35:27.512
He--he waited two weeks
before he signed it

35:27.512 --> 35:28.915
just to make sure
you were gone.

35:29.426 --> 35:31.246
We never had a chance.

35:31.557 --> 35:33.377
Bill had us both.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.956
Puppets on a string.

35:36.314 --> 35:36.977
Huh.

35:37.541 --> 35:39.231
You know the reason I think...

35:40.149 --> 35:43.502
I told him about us
in the first place

35:43.502 --> 35:45.445
is that somewhere inside,

35:46.446 --> 35:47.908
I was hoping he would leave me

35:48.046 --> 35:48.944
and that you would come,

35:48.944 --> 35:50.379
and everything
would be all right.

35:53.439 --> 35:54.559
So what are we going to do?

35:55.136 --> 35:56.321
It could be our baby.

36:03.905 --> 36:05.025
No.

36:07.043 --> 36:08.194
Nora, uh...

36:10.805 --> 36:12.877
Her blood type is AB...

36:13.944 --> 36:15.676
And I'm O.

36:21.777 --> 36:23.597
She can't be my child.

36:27.289 --> 36:28.539
So...

36:30.916 --> 36:33.467
There's nothing
tying us together then.

36:37.576 --> 36:38.787
I guess not.

36:40.292 --> 36:41.359
My God.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.066
It seems the world

36:43.066 --> 36:47.320
and William Walker
were conspiring against us.

36:49.053 --> 36:50.728
Yeah.

36:51.695 --> 36:52.542
Well, you know what?

36:56.237 --> 36:58.887
They're not gonna have
the last word.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.711
We're still here.

37:02.214 --> 37:03.152
Right now.

37:03.990 --> 37:06.873
And I'd say, there's a lot
to tie us together.

37:21.808 --> 37:23.404
Oh, God. I needed that.

37:23.819 --> 37:25.756
You know, there's something
to be said for living in denial.

37:25.756 --> 37:27.951
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's gonna take time.

37:28.899 --> 37:32.445
- Why can't you be my dad, Saul?
- Mm. Well, you know, being an uncle

37:32.445 --> 37:34.548
has all of the benefits
and none of the liabilities.

37:36.162 --> 37:38.869
You know what... I think
is really bothering me

37:38.869 --> 37:39.918
is just the question of

37:41.610 --> 37:45.127
whether or not dad knew
that I wasn't his.

37:45.127 --> 37:46.111
Mm-Hmm.

37:46.217 --> 37:49.001
D.N.A. tests have been around
for a decade or so.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.061
He could've found out anytime.

37:51.762 --> 37:54.214
Stolen my toothbrush and...

37:55.786 --> 37:57.568
It's really unnerving.

37:57.688 --> 37:59.690
Well, if he did know, he took it
with him to the grave,

37:59.690 --> 38:01.629
and we'll never know
the answer to that, so...

38:03.686 --> 38:06.047
I just--
I feel so alone in this.

38:06.065 --> 38:07.076
Well, you're not alone.

38:07.354 --> 38:08.913
There's someone you can go to
right now if you want.

38:08.913 --> 38:10.152
I can't.
I can't talk to mom.

38:10.152 --> 38:12.804
She's already said,
it's very complicated for her.

38:15.091 --> 38:18.030
This whole thing, it's just--
it's such a tangle.

38:18.092 --> 38:19.464
You have to talk to her, Sarah.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.136
I don't know what
your father knew or didn't know.

38:23.136 --> 38:24.547
But I know
that your father loved you.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.404
And your mother loves you,
so... talk to her.

38:30.986 --> 38:31.654
Yeah?

38:31.905 --> 38:34.566
Yeah. Okay. You're right.

38:35.853 --> 38:37.268
Okay.

38:37.703 --> 38:40.194
Ugh! I am so glad
that you called me.

38:40.194 --> 38:42.378
I swear, I thought you were
gonna be in Buenos Aires.

38:42.627 --> 38:44.573
Buenos Aires?
Why Buenos Aires?

38:44.573 --> 38:46.261
Oh, I don't know.
It's far away.

38:47.004 --> 38:49.114
No, I'm...
I'm right here.

38:49.114 --> 38:50.510
- Okay, good. Saul.
- Yes?

38:50.510 --> 38:51.881
- I'm starving.
- Really?

38:51.881 --> 38:53.457
Can you please
go back there and see

38:53.457 --> 38:56.344
- if there's any stale bread left for me?
- Okay.

38:56.344 --> 38:57.779
Stale bread coming up.

38:59.650 --> 39:00.074
Okay.

39:00.074 --> 39:01.445
- My behavior was abominable.
- Mm-Hmm.

39:01.663 --> 39:05.489
I can't believe I just left my
sister high and dry like that.

39:05.489 --> 39:06.809
W-wait a minute.
Did you say "sister"?

39:07.843 --> 39:10.328
"Sister"? Like full sister?

39:10.328 --> 39:12.597
I've been promoted
from half sister?

39:12.597 --> 39:15.052
Okay, listen,
even if I find out

39:15.052 --> 39:17.839
that I was left on
the church steps by strangers,

39:17.839 --> 39:18.975
I promise you,

39:18.975 --> 39:22.808
I'll never, ever, ever
use the word "half" again,

39:22.808 --> 39:23.254
not for anything.

39:23.254 --> 39:25.175
It won't be
half past 1:00 anymore.

39:25.175 --> 39:27.241
For the rest of my life,
it'll be 1:30.

39:30.054 --> 39:31.295
- Good.
- Okay.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.464
Okay, all right.

39:37.897 --> 39:38.828
All right.

39:39.288 --> 39:41.560
Okay.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.034
All right.
There's the elevators.

39:45.438 --> 39:46.724
I will see you guys
at the wedding.

39:51.908 --> 39:53.143
Boy, you are working late, huh?

39:53.362 --> 39:56.798
Yeah, that's why I canceled.
I lost my night clerk.

39:56.798 --> 39:58.371
Oh, don't worry about that.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.851
You look like you've been
working late, too.

40:00.851 --> 40:01.851
Oh, yeah.

40:01.851 --> 40:05.801
I've been babysitting drunk,
horny frenchmen this whole time.

40:05.801 --> 40:07.265
And trust me,
the last place you want to be

40:07.265 --> 40:08.507
when you're sober
is a strip club.

40:10.401 --> 40:14.169
So what happened?
Where's--where's the help?

40:19.125 --> 40:21.701
I lost my night clerk
because I told him to go home.

40:22.661 --> 40:25.084
I wanted to be... alone
to think.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.495
Uh, about what?

40:27.542 --> 40:28.662
It's...

40:30.452 --> 40:31.893
Complicated.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.016
Justin--

40:35.107 --> 40:36.955
Tyler, why-- why wouldn't you
tell me you're married?

40:37.585 --> 40:39.286
Because I'm separated.

40:41.373 --> 40:42.176
Well, when...

40:43.330 --> 40:44.436
When were you gonna tell me?

40:46.033 --> 40:47.442
Never.

40:48.386 --> 40:50.466
Look, Tyler, um...

40:51.879 --> 40:54.291
Relationships
don't always work out.

40:55.193 --> 40:57.236
And, you know,
I was married, too.

40:59.214 --> 41:01.531
That makes me feel
strangely better.

41:03.483 --> 41:04.720
It's been a terrible year.

41:05.670 --> 41:08.056
We don't live together.
We barely speak.

41:08.686 --> 41:10.165
I'm sorry.

41:10.165 --> 41:11.879
I should've never led you on.
I just...

41:13.662 --> 41:15.683
needed something good
in my life again,

41:15.683 --> 41:16.241
and I thought...

41:18.704 --> 41:20.098
Maybe it could be you.
