fatally from ignorance of the past.

THE DAY OF THE SIEGE
SEPTEMBER 11, 1683

01:00.106 --> 01:03.740
On September 11, 1683,

01:03.775 --> 01:06.974
Islam was at the top
of expansion in the West.

01:07.009 --> 01:11.765
300,000 islamic troops
under the command of Kará Mustafá

01:11.800 --> 01:16.169
they were besieging the city that
they called: 'the golden apple': Vienna.

01:17.744 --> 01:22.919
The objective of Kará Mustafá was
guide your army to Rome,

01:22.954 --> 01:26.952
and transform the Basilica of
Saint Peter in a Mosque.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.924
If this never happened,

01:29.959 --> 01:34.052
is due to an Italian monk,
Marco Da Aviano,

01:34.087 --> 01:37.898
and the King of Poland,
Jan Sobieski.

01:37.933 --> 01:40.801
This is his story.

01:46.195 --> 01:49.070
North of Italy.
Autumn 1682

01:58.345 --> 02:02.147
Father Marco.
Please bless us.

02:07.005 --> 02:08.848
Father Marco.

02:09.965 --> 02:11.373
Framework.

02:12.014 --> 02:13.575
You have to enter.

02:14.542 --> 02:16.489
They are waiting for you.

02:25.208 --> 02:28.554
Behind! Stay behind,
please!

02:28.589 --> 02:30.573
Back up, stop!

02:30.608 --> 02:32.771
Back, in the name of the Lord!

02:33.099 --> 02:37.167
- Leave him alone!
- Father Marco, please.

02:37.202 --> 02:39.482
I am blind, I cannot see.

02:53.147 --> 02:56.787
In the name of the Father, of the Son
And of the holy spirit.

02:56.822 --> 02:58.702
Amen.

03:03.064 --> 03:04.572
Tonight...

03:06.611 --> 03:09.625
they have left their houses,

03:10.618 --> 03:14.505
they have quit their job to
come to the Lord's house.

03:16.340 --> 03:19.385
But they have not come here to pray.

03:24.419 --> 03:28.097
They have come here to ask you
this poor monk ...

03:28.132 --> 03:30.056
a miracle...

03:30.091 --> 03:32.507
which is incapable of doing.

03:37.493 --> 03:42.279
It is not to me that you should pray,
but to God.

03:43.174 --> 03:44.825
I am not anything.

03:46.930 --> 03:49.855
I'm just an instrument
that God has chosen ...

03:49.890 --> 03:53.169
to prove its existence.
Pray to God ...

03:53.538 --> 03:58.095
every morning ... thank you

03:58.130 --> 04:01.052
for giving them another day
to live in this world,

04:01.087 --> 04:03.078
feel its wonders.

04:03.559 --> 04:07.768
Pray to God when you are
happy and when they are suffering.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.102
But above all ...

04:13.366 --> 04:17.680
pray to God that
He feels their hearts.

04:17.716 --> 04:21.386
With the strength of being soldiers
of Christ...

04:24.819 --> 04:28.293
to defend their homes ...

04:28.328 --> 04:31.448
to defend their traditions ...

04:33.409 --> 04:35.668
to defend your faith.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.483
Because soon ...

04:41.724 --> 04:44.514
soon...

04:45.627 --> 04:48.910
this is what we will have
what to do.

04:50.677 --> 04:53.141
Defend our faith.

04:57.957 --> 05:00.087
And now pray with me.

05:14.690 --> 05:18.446
I can see! I can see...
I can see.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.126
Oh my gosh, I can see.

05:21.161 --> 05:23.663
I can see, I can see!

05:23.698 --> 05:26.347
It's a miracle! It gave him back his vision!

05:26.382 --> 05:28.156
I can see! Oh my God.

05:28.191 --> 05:30.675
Thank my God!
I can see!

05:30.710 --> 05:33.048
Please stay back!
Back, please.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.790
Come back, leave it.
Stop, back.

05:39.137 --> 05:40.942
What are you doing?

05:41.600 --> 05:44.369
What are you doing?

05:46.625 --> 05:50.945
Do you think a piece
from this blanket will you save them?

05:52.080 --> 05:54.618
It is Christ who will save them.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.653
They are superstitions, for God's sake.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.722
Back, leave it!

05:59.757 --> 06:02.259
Make way, back!

06:02.294 --> 06:04.424
Go back to your houses.

06:11.755 --> 06:16.547
Oh God...
Oh my God.

06:21.564 --> 06:24.450
I have prayed for my people
for years.

06:27.739 --> 06:30.872
For years, none of this
never happened.

06:34.817 --> 06:36.671
Because I?

06:39.804 --> 06:41.645
Why?

06:43.173 --> 06:47.231
Istanbul. Turkey.

08:07.067 --> 08:10.598
We nominate you, Kará Mustafá ...

08:10.633 --> 08:13.659
Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire.

08:14.204 --> 08:19.389
We trust you too
the baton of command.

08:19.773 --> 08:24.607
We ask you to take
the green flag of Muhammad ...

08:24.642 --> 08:27.244
back to the same heart
of Europe.

09:05.385 --> 09:07.012
Yes!

09:19.896 --> 09:23.873
It wasn't that easy to beat this time.
True?

09:23.908 --> 09:25.387
True.

09:25.422 --> 09:27.492
Before the passing of many moons ...

09:27.843 --> 09:31.251
you will be the first
on reaching the top of the hill.

09:31.588 --> 09:33.117
Trust me.

09:41.769 --> 09:43.733
I want to be like you, father.

09:43.768 --> 09:45.903
I want to be a great warrior.

09:46.497 --> 09:48.169
You will be.

09:48.729 --> 09:51.247
And you will be really great.

09:52.926 --> 09:57.686
Because you inherited beauty
of your mother and the strength of your father.

10:04.864 --> 10:06.495
Let's go now.

10:07.283 --> 10:09.575
Or your mother will start
to worry.

10:52.765 --> 10:54.091
Enough.

11:02.003 --> 11:04.625
You don't seem happy to see me.

11:07.191 --> 11:10.846
Every moment that I waited for you
It has been an eternity, my lord.

11:11.151 --> 11:14.790
So ... why are they
so melancholic now?

11:15.606 --> 11:18.043
It is just a strange dream.

11:18.619 --> 11:20.833
A dream without importance.

11:22.128 --> 11:24.024
So tell me, my lord ...

11:24.481 --> 11:28.820
What is the task that will take you
away from your favorite?

11:35.011 --> 11:36.653
It's a homework...

11:37.734 --> 11:41.045
in which no commander
of the Ottoman Empire ...

11:41.080 --> 11:42.928
it has never been successful.

11:47.239 --> 11:51.112
Carry the green flag of the prophet
to the very heart of Europe.

11:51.432 --> 11:54.038
And put the West under my faith.

11:54.073 --> 11:57.742
As my ancestors used to put
horse meat under their mounts ...

11:57.777 --> 11:59.451
to make offerings ...

11:59.486 --> 12:04.417
I want to conquer
the 'golden apple' ... Vienna.

12:05.554 --> 12:08.712
And guide my army to Rome.

12:09.477 --> 12:12.363
And give my horse water
in the Plaza de San Pedro.

12:16.317 --> 12:19.124
You never take off that amulet.

12:23.668 --> 12:27.340
My informants told me
Some days ago...

12:27.580 --> 12:30.432
that in lands in the lands of Venice
there's a man...

12:30.467 --> 12:34.139
a monk, who does
extraordinary wonders.

12:34.717 --> 12:38.816
Heal the crippled,
returns vision to the blind ...

12:39.426 --> 12:42.179
and it can be in two places
at the same time.

12:43.781 --> 12:45.882
His name is Marco.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.152
Framework.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.612
It's the boy's name
the one I saved my life ...

13:06.053 --> 13:08.261
Many years ago.

13:08.296 --> 13:11.859
It was he who gave me
this amulet.

13:19.070 --> 13:20.565
It's okay like that?

13:21.173 --> 13:23.802
No, it does not have enough color.

13:24.439 --> 13:26.378
It has to be deeper.

13:26.413 --> 13:30.803
If the color is very bright,
looks bad.

13:30.838 --> 13:33.543
No, I want it to turn out ...

13:33.578 --> 13:35.189
very bright...

13:48.464 --> 13:51.222
It has been many years...

13:51.257 --> 13:55.255
since the last time
You visited your father.

13:55.831 --> 13:59.230
Now there is another force in your life ...

13:59.265 --> 14:02.690
which is much more important
that you, Carlo ...

14:03.298 --> 14:05.897
it is our Father who
it's in heaven.

14:05.986 --> 14:07.946
Of course.

14:07.981 --> 14:13.711
And you haven't had to try to
exceed every month.

14:15.997 --> 14:17.372
Carlo.

14:20.392 --> 14:24.503
Do you remember the night i found
Father Giovanni's sword in the forest?

14:24.538 --> 14:26.328
In that night...

14:26.705 --> 14:28.905
God called me.

14:28.940 --> 14:31.629
It wasn't my imagination ...

14:31.664 --> 14:33.662
it wasn't a fever ...

14:33.697 --> 14:35.793
it was not delirium.

14:36.001 --> 14:39.391
It was the voice of God calling me
that night.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.903
I decided to become a priest.

14:42.533 --> 14:47.692
We need more than a hand
at the dry cleaner, Marco.

14:47.727 --> 14:49.238
Not a priest.

14:52.199 --> 14:54.816
But you decided otherwise.

15:00.049 --> 15:03.812
Excuse me, but I'm very tired.

15:04.363 --> 15:07.075
Good night...
Good night son.

15:12.853 --> 15:14.440
Let's go.

15:15.252 --> 15:18.448
Work doesn't go
as well as before.

15:18.977 --> 15:20.538
You were already there.

15:20.573 --> 15:22.541
I know, sorry, mother.

15:24.510 --> 15:27.528
Turks begin to do
raids.

15:28.056 --> 15:30.526
The ships of the crescent moon ...

15:30.561 --> 15:32.527
They no longer reach Venice.

15:35.232 --> 15:38.315
- Your father is ...
- Madam, come quickly!

15:38.350 --> 15:40.429
- Quick.
- What's up, Walter?

15:40.464 --> 15:43.252
A group of young people are
going up the hill.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.598
They say they are going to kill Abul.

15:45.952 --> 15:47.292
Oh my God.

15:48.293 --> 15:50.926
Get out of our way!

15:52.093 --> 15:54.619
Come on, stop!

15:54.654 --> 15:57.342
Get out of the way!
We will not say it again.

15:57.377 --> 15:59.694
- This does not concern you.
- Put this down, monk.

16:03.344 --> 16:05.787
What are they doing?
They are crazy?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.187
Abul is our brother.

16:08.222 --> 16:11.008
Even if I think differently,
he is our brother.

16:11.043 --> 16:13.767
No, it's not like us!

16:13.802 --> 16:15.917
- He's a Turk!
- He's a damn Turk.

16:15.952 --> 16:17.625
Enough already!

16:17.660 --> 16:20.801
You weren't even born
when he got to Aviana.

16:20.836 --> 16:22.394
In all these years ...

16:22.429 --> 16:24.847
has not hurt anyone.

16:24.882 --> 16:26.896
Live poorly.

16:26.931 --> 16:29.356
We can live together.

16:29.391 --> 16:31.484
If we respect the faith of
others.

16:31.519 --> 16:34.189
We can live in peace with
this people.

16:34.224 --> 16:37.016
Peace? What are you
talking, Marco?

16:37.051 --> 16:41.118
Two days ago his kind
they razed dozens of villages.

16:41.153 --> 16:43.387
It's true, they cut the throat
of the men

16:43.422 --> 16:45.129
and they took the women and
children.

16:45.164 --> 16:46.515
God.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.952
Enough! Let's kill him!

16:48.987 --> 16:50.738
- No!
- Kill him, kill him!

17:13.172 --> 17:14.589
Let's go.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.415
Let's go!

17:17.915 --> 17:22.410
Return to Turkey. Not always
You will have the monk to protect you.

17:22.711 --> 17:24.104
We will return.

17:24.729 --> 17:27.586
Remember us.
We will be back soon.

17:28.768 --> 17:30.756
We will catch you, Turk.

17:32.439 --> 17:35.168
No, you risked your life.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.783
You should not do it!

17:39.171 --> 17:42.017
It can't hear you.
It is deaf-dumb.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.154
Lives with you?

17:47.220 --> 17:49.886
My God is more tolerant
than yours, Marco.

17:49.921 --> 17:51.990
Of many ways.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.410
Why didn't you defend yourself ...
out there?

17:59.667 --> 18:01.931
Our destiny is decided.

18:01.966 --> 18:04.298
It is absurd to try to deflect it.

18:04.471 --> 18:06.501
You know, Abul ...

18:06.864 --> 18:10.454
years ago when I was studying
at the seminar ...

18:12.007 --> 18:16.030
I thought a lot about how the
God you believe in ...

18:16.450 --> 18:18.487
It is so different from mine.

18:19.601 --> 18:21.417
I asked myself ...

18:21.670 --> 18:24.445
Why does this God allow ...?

18:24.480 --> 18:27.155
that so many people create
in a God ...

18:27.383 --> 18:29.592
who is not Himself?

18:31.790 --> 18:36.030
And then I realized that
it is his children who carry his light ...

18:37.716 --> 18:39.851
where it is needed.

18:42.949 --> 18:45.045
One day, Abul ...

18:45.080 --> 18:47.261
you two will see the
true light.

18:53.702 --> 18:55.932
All the lights are true, Marco.

18:58.030 --> 19:00.701
There is only one true light,
Abul.

19:01.277 --> 19:02.702
Only one.

20:33.424 --> 20:36.008
By Allah!

20:55.854 --> 20:57.686
- Leave us.
- My Sir.

21:01.591 --> 21:04.699
What demons disturb your dreams?

21:06.614 --> 21:10.235
Tonight i saw you again
on that hill.

21:21.246 --> 21:23.664
That same dream tonight too?

21:26.462 --> 21:29.554
Every time it seems to come back
more clear.

21:30.619 --> 21:34.013
It's like another chapter
out of the same story.

21:35.029 --> 21:36.541
And this night...

21:36.576 --> 21:39.216
the dream reveals how
the story ends.

21:39.848 --> 21:41.364
It is not true?

21:42.023 --> 21:44.438
Yes it's correct.

21:52.739 --> 21:54.755
He is the Grand Vizier.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.563
Yes, it is Kará Mustafá.

22:38.998 --> 22:40.872
You must speak now.

22:40.907 --> 22:43.112
What is it you want to know?

22:44.779 --> 22:47.090
I'm going to be on a great mission soon.

22:47.635 --> 22:49.194
But there is a dream ...

22:49.229 --> 22:52.172
that is tormenting me
for many nights.

22:52.270 --> 22:56.933
Tell me about your dream ...
Kará Mustafá.

22:57.957 --> 23:01.661
I'm at the top of the hill
armor dress ...

23:02.773 --> 23:04.233
for the war.

23:06.004 --> 23:07.815
There's a man...

23:08.005 --> 23:11.527
wearing ... just a monk habit ...

23:11.562 --> 23:15.143
at the head of thousands of
Warriors.

23:15.854 --> 23:20.729
In his right hand he has ...
a wooden cross.

23:20.764 --> 23:24.562
And then many arrows come out
flying...

23:24.597 --> 23:26.068
towards me.

23:26.103 --> 23:29.016
10, 20 and give me.

23:29.301 --> 23:30.684
AND...

23:33.878 --> 23:38.545
No. This dream is not yours ...
Kará Mustafá.

23:38.743 --> 23:42.883
It's a woman's dream ...
a woman from your harem.

23:43.516 --> 23:46.389
It is the dream of your favorite.

23:46.586 --> 23:50.252
Where is this woman from?

23:51.509 --> 23:53.484
She is Italian.

23:53.519 --> 23:57.545
It was ripped from her village
when I was 4 years.

23:58.714 --> 24:03.135
So ... there must be something
really in their visions.

24:04.238 --> 24:07.273
Are you predicting my future?

24:11.626 --> 24:12.951
Me...

24:14.305 --> 24:15.649
I see...

24:17.967 --> 24:19.451
blood.

24:22.572 --> 24:24.606
Lots of blood.

24:30.664 --> 24:32.867
Are you sure what it says?

24:34.090 --> 24:35.395
Yes.

24:35.430 --> 24:39.257
I see a lot of blood, but not yours.

24:39.793 --> 24:41.630
Not yours.

24:55.331 --> 24:58.643
Your blood will not be shed,

24:59.105 --> 25:01.566
Kará Mustafá.

25:09.197 --> 25:11.464
- Look over there.
- Where?

25:11.499 --> 25:12.929
There, on the tower.

25:12.964 --> 25:14.673
Oh yeah.

25:14.708 --> 25:16.296
Is beautiful.

25:16.331 --> 25:18.205
It can be seen perfectly.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.902
Even without the invention.

25:19.937 --> 25:23.053
Here it is again.
It is breaking through the sky.

25:23.294 --> 25:26.553
- From the East.
- Like an arrival.

25:26.588 --> 25:28.957
The announcement of the birth
of our lord ...

25:28.992 --> 25:31.091
to the three wise men.

25:31.456 --> 25:34.118
Look for yourself, Father Marco.

25:41.615 --> 25:43.340
Oh my Lord Jesus.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.604
It really seems like it is
the arrival of...

25:53.534 --> 25:56.090
What's up, Father Marco?
Framework.

25:56.125 --> 25:58.590
What have you seen that
have you put it like this?

26:01.228 --> 26:02.694
What's going on?

26:15.314 --> 26:16.824
It is blood.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.143
Blood of the East.

26:22.128 --> 26:24.070
This is a sign.

26:26.455 --> 26:28.623
This is the signal.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.777
What i'm going to tell you
it will cause you regret.

26:55.995 --> 26:58.554
The time is coming
I'm leaving, Lena.

27:00.108 --> 27:02.393
- Where?
- To home.

27:02.428 --> 27:04.218
To Istanbul.

27:07.754 --> 27:09.386
I can't take you with me.

27:09.873 --> 27:13.152
The comet ... is a sign of war.

27:13.392 --> 27:16.422
In my country there is no place
in battle for women.

27:23.823 --> 27:25.448
You're right.

27:26.667 --> 27:30.175
Between your heart and your faith,
you choose your heart.

27:30.527 --> 27:32.657
It is ungrateful of you.

27:33.888 --> 27:35.865
I bet you trust, Lena.

27:37.281 --> 27:41.201
Only between my heart ...

27:41.236 --> 27:44.577
and my faith, I must choose my faith.

27:45.536 --> 27:47.333
You understand me?

27:48.750 --> 27:52.174
This is what makes us Muslims
so different from Westerners.

28:27.391 --> 28:31.813
Allah the Almighty will be
with us very soon.

28:31.848 --> 28:33.734
We must march west.

28:33.969 --> 28:38.769
To carry the green flag of
prophet to the very heart of Europe.

28:39.626 --> 28:43.710
We will punish the infidels.

28:44.047 --> 28:47.442
For daring to reject
to the people of Islam ...

28:48.319 --> 28:49.771
Lepanto.

28:52.838 --> 28:58.519
- Allah is great.
- Allah is great!

29:01.108 --> 29:05.509
Marco, what is it that the
Emperor wants from you?

29:05.694 --> 29:08.048
I don't know, brother.

29:08.322 --> 29:10.960
But I know what I will ask of you.

29:11.480 --> 29:15.051
I will ask you to form alliances
military ...

29:15.410 --> 29:17.459
and get ready.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.104
I do not understand.

29:19.439 --> 29:22.053
Why the Emperor must
form military alliances?

29:22.751 --> 29:25.130
No one is threatening
to the empire.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.387
The threat will come soon.

29:28.422 --> 29:30.895
No, it is not possible, Marco.

29:30.930 --> 29:34.366
Why would they do it?
They signed a peace treaty.

29:34.401 --> 29:37.437
The East wants to conquer
the world, Cosme.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.755
And they know what the time is
precise to attack.

29:42.835 --> 29:45.225
That stinging pain again?

29:45.260 --> 29:47.088
Yes, worse than ever.

29:47.632 --> 29:50.521
Drink this, Marco.
It'll be good for you.

29:55.442 --> 29:57.192
Smells good.

30:01.457 --> 30:03.010
Dear God...

30:04.492 --> 30:06.657
keep us away from war.

30:08.136 --> 30:11.788
You know I want more than anything
live in peace.

30:12.860 --> 30:14.738
At peace with you ...

30:14.980 --> 30:17.627
with our country, with
our neighbors.

30:20.140 --> 30:24.068
If my death can be of any use ...

30:26.020 --> 30:28.182
take me now

30:30.188 --> 30:31.685
I'm ready.

30:41.565 --> 30:44.732
You have given me a burden
very heavy, my Lord.

30:49.542 --> 30:51.368
It's too big.

31:10.395 --> 31:13.337
I wait for you.
See if it's ready.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.632
Brother, fear not.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.407
I'm afraid it is dangerous.

31:19.425 --> 31:22.102
You better keep me
Far from him.

31:32.385 --> 31:34.717
- Are you ready, my dear?
- Yes, mother.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.615
Let it go.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.751
Already.

31:54.139 --> 31:56.474
What a magnificent catch.

31:57.170 --> 32:00.873
It was instantly.
It was so fast.

32:00.908 --> 32:03.260
- You know what?
- Tell me, Your Majesty.

32:03.834 --> 32:08.015
If my soldiers were so cunning
like my sister's hawks,

32:08.050 --> 32:11.937
would have an army
truly invincible.

32:12.576 --> 32:14.287
Your Majesty.

32:20.084 --> 32:23.546
Father Marco, we were waiting
eagerly his arrival.

32:23.581 --> 32:25.702
- Welcome, Father.
- They told me that you ...

32:25.737 --> 32:28.274
did extraordinary things
in Italy.

32:28.779 --> 32:32.566
My cousin Carlo, after
of a single blessing from him ...

32:32.601 --> 32:34.263
his burns were removed.

32:34.298 --> 32:36.871
Everything comes from heaven, Your Majesty.

32:37.374 --> 32:40.460
God is often shown
through the poor and humble.

32:40.940 --> 32:42.283
Insurance.

32:42.318 --> 32:44.970
And among all the humble
and the poor ...

32:45.005 --> 32:46.680
Heaven has chosen you.

32:48.405 --> 32:51.604
And now I ask you to
bless my family

32:51.639 --> 32:55.018
And then I wish I could retire to
my studio to talk to you alone.

33:03.589 --> 33:07.971
You may be wondering, no doubt,
why I made him come to Vienna.

33:09.463 --> 33:10.952
You see ...

33:12.658 --> 33:15.116
I deeply envy him.

33:15.676 --> 33:18.004
- Honestly it is.
- I do not understand.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.877
I wanted to become a priest.

33:22.007 --> 33:24.015
Like you, but ...

33:25.219 --> 33:27.351
God decided otherwise.

33:27.552 --> 33:29.405
Your Majesty...

33:29.440 --> 33:32.749
right now you
represents so much power ...

33:33.374 --> 33:37.507
It is you who must feel it
and not me. And still I accept ...

33:37.542 --> 33:40.231
God's will,
in all humility,

33:40.266 --> 33:43.031
because he knows what
it is better for your children.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.825
I have something to propose to you, Father.

33:45.860 --> 33:49.179
I ask him to convert
on my counselor.

33:49.214 --> 33:51.866
To be able to consult it when
have need.

33:52.419 --> 33:53.809
AND...

33:55.002 --> 33:56.633
Power?

33:57.601 --> 34:00.111
What power is he talking about,
In the name of God?

34:01.593 --> 34:03.089
Majesty...

34:03.642 --> 34:07.705
It has been months since the Turks
They are wreaking havoc in the West.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.341
When you like ...

34:09.376 --> 34:13.379
and they won't be happy
with the land of hungry Poland.

34:13.414 --> 34:16.277
Soon ... they will attack Vienna.

34:16.539 --> 34:18.888
What he says is very serious,
Father, but ...

34:18.922 --> 34:21.751
But they have signed a peace treaty.

34:22.295 --> 34:25.360
Your Majesty, the 30 year war
it has weakened Europe.

34:25.395 --> 34:29.034
And a weak Europe is too much
temptation for Muslims.

34:29.069 --> 34:31.463
No ... he's imagining it.

34:31.754 --> 34:34.199
With all due respect, Your Majesty ...

34:34.235 --> 34:37.143
I don't make it up.
Listen to me please.

34:37.456 --> 34:39.862
You must make alliances ...

34:39.898 --> 34:41.618
with the priests of Sicily ...

34:41.652 --> 34:43.418
with the Palatinate ...

34:43.454 --> 34:45.565
with the King of the barbarians,
but above all ...

34:45.600 --> 34:47.549
with the King of Poland.

34:47.583 --> 34:48.936
No no no.

34:52.126 --> 34:54.333
That peasant, that ...

34:54.368 --> 34:57.261
- barbarian with crucifix.
- Your Majesty.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.757
He hates me.

35:00.819 --> 35:03.383
Do you listen me? Hates me.

35:03.418 --> 35:05.535
Jan Sobieski never know
would ally with us.

35:06.837 --> 35:09.227
Have you forgotten that your wife
came from paris?

35:09.508 --> 35:13.718
And King Louis would do any
thing to keep it like that ...

35:14.230 --> 35:18.296
In fact, it is King Louis who is
encouraging the Turks to break the treaty.

35:19.037 --> 35:20.367
But...

35:20.674 --> 35:23.961
the treaty will expire next year,
Father Marco.

35:26.328 --> 35:28.019
There is no reason to worry.

35:29.125 --> 35:32.899
They will wait until it comes out
the new spring grass.

35:33.913 --> 35:37.746
When it happens, the army
and the Grand Vizier will leave Istanbul.

35:37.781 --> 35:39.716
And very soon after that ...

35:40.321 --> 35:45.269
you will see the dust of his mount
before the walls of Vienna.

35:45.446 --> 35:48.773
What will you do when that happens?

35:51.654 --> 35:53.291
Let's make sure ...

35:53.891 --> 35:55.723
that it doesn't happen.

35:55.758 --> 35:57.772
Come, come with me.

36:15.893 --> 36:17.616
Raliv, come.

36:18.682 --> 36:21.947
Father Marco, I want you
meet my sister, the duchess.

36:22.731 --> 36:25.021
And her husband, Duke Carlo.

36:25.056 --> 36:27.151
Father Marco, welcome to Vienna.

36:28.815 --> 36:31.368
I see that you have noticed my face.

36:31.403 --> 36:33.211
It is smallpox.

36:33.246 --> 36:35.748
And yes, it can be more
devastating than a battle.

36:35.861 --> 36:40.219
And let me introduce you to
Earl Ernst Huddiger of Stahremberg.

36:40.254 --> 36:41.949
She has military command of the city.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.368
Do you know this music,
Father Marco?

36:46.326 --> 36:49.277
No i'm just a monk
ignorant...

36:49.312 --> 36:53.870
Ignorant? Father Marco, you
he is smarter than all of us.

36:53.905 --> 36:56.604
- And you have direct access to God.
- Oh yeah.

36:56.828 --> 37:00.233
- And you know this music, Marie?
- Certainly.

37:00.929 --> 37:03.844
It is a composite piece
by Claudio Monteverdi.

37:03.879 --> 37:07.410
It's a very famous toccata ...
very accurate.

37:08.135 --> 37:10.008
I'm surprised you don't know her.

37:14.080 --> 37:18.089
Look, Father Marco ... what dinner
so wonderful we have prepared

37:18.124 --> 37:19.935
specially for you.

37:26.848 --> 37:29.259
Father Marco ... where is he?

37:29.918 --> 37:33.269
Please sit down and share
this delight with us.

37:33.574 --> 37:35.139
Your Majesty...

37:35.174 --> 37:38.904
Years of confinement have turned
our stomach in ...

37:38.939 --> 37:41.508
We are not in a position to
honor such food.

37:41.741 --> 37:43.357
Excuse us.

37:43.692 --> 37:45.801
But are you guys leaving ...?

37:46.775 --> 37:49.291
- I'm afraid so.
- What rudeness.

37:50.011 --> 37:52.772
Sit in our court
it's a privilege...

37:52.807 --> 37:54.706
that they have very few.

37:54.741 --> 37:57.147
Can anyone explain
this to our friends?

37:57.428 --> 38:00.473
- She...
- I understand, duchess, but ...

38:01.089 --> 38:04.525
i feel uncomfortable in
the royal courts.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.694
Uncomfortable?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.672
Uncomfortable he says.

38:09.328 --> 38:12.045
His emperor invites him to
your table...

38:12.080 --> 38:13.839
and you feel uncomfortable.

38:16.350 --> 38:18.523
- How do you dare?
- Duchess ...

38:18.748 --> 38:24.714
Your Majesty, I feel comfortable
only in the solitude of my monastery.

38:24.749 --> 38:26.711
And praying to my God.

38:26.843 --> 38:29.841
But I don't want to spoil
your dinner, Duchess.

38:29.876 --> 38:33.566
Well my dinner has already been
spoiled, Father.

38:35.222 --> 38:37.223
It's not important.

38:39.542 --> 38:42.588
Is there anything I can do
for you?

38:43.716 --> 38:46.053
Yes, there is one thing you can do.

38:46.699 --> 38:51.498
Give your dinner to our refuge
so that we can give it to the poor.

38:52.322 --> 38:56.283
And ... a lot of bread for our trip.

39:01.619 --> 39:04.774
I hope the advice of
this monk ...

39:04.809 --> 39:07.889
make him find manners
of the spirit, dear brother.

39:12.068 --> 39:14.167
Yes, let's start.

39:33.850 --> 39:35.223
Now...

39:35.440 --> 39:39.641
I will explain what we will do.

39:41.298 --> 39:43.841
We will follow the course of
Maretson ...

39:43.876 --> 39:46.030
to the Pinduss mountains.

39:47.134 --> 39:49.024
And in less than two months ...

39:50.584 --> 39:52.737
we will be reaching
Vienna walls.

39:53.074 --> 39:56.342
The astronomer has confirmed it.

39:56.846 --> 39:59.431
The comet is the signal that
We were waiting.

39:59.902 --> 40:01.909
It is the will of Allah.

40:02.217 --> 40:05.951
And in the name of Allah, we will overcome in
the biggest mission ...

40:05.986 --> 40:08.719
that the people of Islam
has never assumed.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.552
And the French army?

40:12.301 --> 40:15.607
Is the Grand Vizier having
into account the French army?

40:16.393 --> 40:20.010
The Minister of War does not
you have to worry.

40:20.332 --> 40:22.902
The French army does not
It will move.

40:22.937 --> 40:25.545
King Louis hates the emperor
Austrian.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.640
And in relation to weapons ...

40:27.675 --> 40:29.744
our commander of
artillery...

40:29.902 --> 40:32.780
showed me that we can
have a cannon ...

40:32.815 --> 40:35.523
able to reduce the walls
from Vienna ...

40:36.082 --> 40:37.654
to ashes.

40:37.689 --> 40:40.320
Perhaps the Grand Vizier has forgotten ...

40:40.355 --> 40:42.386
that Ahmmed Bey ...

40:42.421 --> 40:46.163
was once a Christian monk,
who rejected his faith.

40:47.354 --> 40:50.185
Ahmmed Bey, your Highness ...

40:50.220 --> 40:53.718
embraced the faith of Islam ...
Many years ago.

40:53.753 --> 40:56.860
Is ready to die
anytime...

40:56.895 --> 40:58.682
for the triumph of Jihad.

40:59.834 --> 41:03.087
King Solé will not move a
finger when we attack.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.066
Think this war
can serve you.

41:06.347 --> 41:07.948
Because he is convinced ...

41:08.347 --> 41:11.201
that once we have
defeated Leopold of Habsberg ...

41:11.236 --> 41:14.572
he will become the sovereign
most important in Europe.

41:15.117 --> 41:17.507
Without more enemies ...

41:17.773 --> 41:19.983
except us.

41:26.402 --> 41:28.837
We will be your
true enemies.

41:28.872 --> 41:31.564
But when King Luis
Realize that ...

41:31.798 --> 41:33.895
it will be too late.

41:33.930 --> 41:35.876
Because that day ...

41:36.157 --> 41:40.069
all the territory will be
turned into musk.

41:48.450 --> 41:50.321
I come from the West.

41:50.356 --> 41:52.830
With great information
importance to the Grand Vizier.

41:54.014 --> 41:55.434
Get away, beggar.

41:55.469 --> 41:58.832
The Grand Vizier is with his
officers and cannot be disturbed.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.896
I have information from the
christian land.

42:01.931 --> 42:03.912
- It could be useful for the Grand Vizier.
- Enough already!

42:03.947 --> 42:06.999
Get lost, beggar.
You are just a shame.

42:07.034 --> 42:08.779
What's going on?

42:08.814 --> 42:12.020
- What is all this?
- Sorry, Grand Vizier.

42:12.055 --> 42:15.688
This man says he has
Important information for the Grand Vizier.

42:18.032 --> 42:19.520
Leave us alone.

42:32.288 --> 42:34.360
Tell me about this man.

42:39.642 --> 42:41.417
He is a monk.

42:41.452 --> 42:43.316
He has worked miracles.

42:43.351 --> 42:47.068
Gives back sight to the blind,
makes the cripple walk.

42:47.729 --> 42:50.038
They say it can be on
two places at once.

42:50.983 --> 42:52.464
Miracles?

42:52.599 --> 42:53.953
Cheats!

42:54.747 --> 42:57.668
The usual tricks of
these impostors.

42:58.285 --> 43:00.778
The Christian church is
closely linked to it.

43:00.914 --> 43:03.260
His words are like thunder
for the people.

43:03.469 --> 43:06.560
He says they must form a force
sacred against Islam.

43:06.865 --> 43:09.217
In the same spirit of Lepanto.

43:09.761 --> 43:12.737
Says the guided battle
for Islam ...

43:13.283 --> 43:16.221
it's just the beginning of a
battle for all of Europe.

43:18.389 --> 43:19.745
AND...

43:19.998 --> 43:22.714
Who exactly is
this monk ...?

43:22.749 --> 43:25.415
What do you think can stop
the prophet's army?

43:26.005 --> 43:27.557
You know him, Grand Vizier.

43:28.750 --> 43:30.386
You already met him.

43:33.922 --> 43:35.674
You are playing with me?

43:35.739 --> 43:37.822
- You dare!
- By the mighty Allah,

43:37.857 --> 43:39.202
I would never dare, Grand Vizier.

43:39.237 --> 43:41.288
I speak of many years ago.

43:41.442 --> 43:43.566
He saved his life in Venice ...

43:43.847 --> 43:48.333
and he gave him the tusk
gold that has on his neck.

44:00.397 --> 44:02.722
I should have let him die.

44:04.024 --> 44:05.507
Darkan!

44:09.266 --> 44:12.358
- Yes my lord.
- Watch this man.

44:12.393 --> 44:16.358
And get ready. In some
days we march north.

44:36.352 --> 44:39.454
The eyes of the son of Kará Mustafá
they are wet.

44:40.268 --> 44:43.128
The son of Kará Mustafá
He is afraid.

44:43.688 --> 44:45.514
Fear for his father.

44:48.384 --> 44:50.510
Leave those tears, Ali.

44:50.616 --> 44:52.699
You know we don't cry.

44:59.652 --> 45:01.509
I will let you know a secret.

45:02.677 --> 45:05.244
A secret between you and me.

45:08.804 --> 45:12.094
I saw a great seer
some days ago.

45:12.288 --> 45:17.076
And predicted that I will fight
a terrible battle ...

45:17.111 --> 45:20.051
where thousands will die.

45:20.086 --> 45:21.659
Thousands.

45:22.315 --> 45:26.088
But my blood ... will not be shed.

45:26.673 --> 45:28.206
Do you understand

45:29.687 --> 45:32.088
So I know I will be back.

45:45.091 --> 45:48.089
This is my amulet of
good luck.

45:50.273 --> 45:52.027
I entrust it to you.

45:54.955 --> 45:58.611
You will return it to me ...
to my comeback.

46:13.807 --> 46:17.608
Edirne, Turkey, March 15, 1683

46:42.619 --> 46:44.316
Father Marco.

46:48.910 --> 46:51.690
I was less than polite to you
in the past.

46:51.759 --> 46:55.743
I was lost and I couldn't
see beyond my anger.

46:55.778 --> 46:58.966
And for this ... I beg your pardon.

46:59.501 --> 47:00.819
Of course.

47:00.980 --> 47:05.736
But now, I want
pray for my torment, Father.

47:10.651 --> 47:12.452
Take these bandages off me.

47:13.466 --> 47:15.071
Take them off me!

47:15.106 --> 47:17.464
Duchess, Duchess ...

47:18.482 --> 47:21.883
It is not necessary, I can pray
without having to see it.

47:21.918 --> 47:24.030
No. No, Father.

47:25.608 --> 47:28.070
If you see my suffering ...

47:28.758 --> 47:31.389
your prayers will be long
more intense.

47:33.599 --> 47:35.120
Oh my God.

47:38.509 --> 47:40.204
My dear sir ...

47:41.460 --> 47:44.814
- My Sir.
- He's taking my life, Father.

47:46.534 --> 47:49.947
I don't want to die.
I beg you.

47:50.845 --> 47:52.644
I beg you.

48:08.592 --> 48:10.745
I'm not going to die, am I, Father?

48:14.986 --> 48:18.470
I will not die ...
I will not die.

48:20.028 --> 48:22.823
You will not die.

48:30.276 --> 48:34.226
Come on, God needs you
for your plans.

48:37.444 --> 48:40.731
You are not going to die.

48:54.548 --> 48:56.185
Get out of the way!

48:56.571 --> 49:00.123
My God, no!
No, stop!

49:00.882 --> 49:02.483
In the name of God!

49:22.007 --> 49:23.444
You see, Marco ...

49:23.980 --> 49:27.629
she has come to Vienna ...
to look for Abul.

49:28.797 --> 49:30.965
She has done it for love.

49:31.254 --> 49:34.108
But Abul is a Muslim.

49:34.652 --> 49:36.649
Abul is a man.

49:37.218 --> 49:40.099
And there's no need
to whisper, Cosme.

49:40.134 --> 49:42.126
Lena is deaf, remember?

49:49.088 --> 49:51.542
You cannot stay here.

49:51.928 --> 49:54.751
Soon, there will be a war.

49:59.272 --> 50:03.707
No ... Abul has met
with his people.

50:04.301 --> 50:06.005
Forget this.

50:09.995 --> 50:12.124
You can not?

50:12.938 --> 50:15.468
In the name of God, why?

50:28.486 --> 50:30.445
Oh, mother of God.

50:39.942 --> 50:41.805
They are approaching.

51:00.841 --> 51:02.983
Grand Vizier Kará Mustafá ...

51:03.018 --> 51:06.974
Allah's call has come
to each of the Tartars.

51:07.009 --> 51:12.211
And in the saddle of our horses,
we are under your command.

51:12.957 --> 51:16.531
We were waiting for you ...
Murad.

51:54.768 --> 51:57.465
- Your Majesty.
- Who is this man?

51:57.500 --> 51:59.701
His Majesty, the messenger.

52:00.886 --> 52:03.750
I’m Joe Kushinski.
We come from Istanbul

52:03.785 --> 52:06.162
with a letter from the Grand Vizier
Kará Mustafá.

52:06.197 --> 52:09.276
Which has already been translated,
your Majesty.

52:32.465 --> 52:34.311
So is there war?

52:39.105 --> 52:43.546
I, Grand Vizier Kará Mustafá,
defender of true faith ...

52:43.581 --> 52:45.406
I demand that...

52:47.111 --> 52:48.505
Go on.

52:50.626 --> 52:54.892
The unfaithful dog Leopold of Austria ...

52:54.927 --> 52:58.061
to leave the lands that
occupies unfairly.

52:58.096 --> 53:01.280
My army will overcome all resistance
and we will occupy the golden apple

53:01.315 --> 53:02.702
that you call Vienna.

53:02.737 --> 53:04.873
The same...

53:04.908 --> 53:07.557
unfaithful dog, I declare ...

53:07.592 --> 53:11.171
to wait for my arrival at
that city and when I have it before me,

53:11.206 --> 53:12.592
I'll pass ...

53:13.974 --> 53:16.036
Above his head.

53:16.071 --> 53:17.829
Oh my God.

53:19.761 --> 53:22.448
But ... how many men do you estimate?

53:23.040 --> 53:27.016
I understand that some
300,000.

53:29.160 --> 53:32.045
But, not all are soldiers,
your Majesty.

53:32.080 --> 53:36.222
They are known to travel with a large
number of followers and occupants

53:36.257 --> 53:37.616
and prostitutes.

53:37.651 --> 53:39.300
300,000?

53:39.731 --> 53:41.262
300,000.

53:41.297 --> 53:43.636
- It's terrible, it's terrible.
- What is terrible?

53:43.671 --> 53:46.490
Didn't you hear it?
They will come.

53:46.525 --> 53:48.591
To force us to leave
Vienna.

53:48.626 --> 53:51.773
You cannot leave the city,
your Majesty.

53:51.808 --> 53:53.680
What else can I do?

53:53.801 --> 53:56.836
If Vienna falls, we can always
reconquer it.

53:56.871 --> 54:00.035
But and I ... will kill me.

54:00.509 --> 54:02.358
And my children.

54:02.393 --> 54:05.095
What shall we do, God?

54:05.130 --> 54:07.480
No. The letter said so.

54:08.963 --> 54:11.264
'Wait for my arrival in that city ...

54:11.299 --> 54:13.865
'and as soon as I have it
in front...

54:13.900 --> 54:16.209
'I will pass over your head'.

54:16.906 --> 54:20.068
A mouse, that's how I feel,
a mouse.

54:20.103 --> 54:22.683
Cornered by two fierce cats.

54:22.859 --> 54:26.448
On the one hand that thirsty madman
of blood Kará Mustafá ...

54:26.483 --> 54:29.630
and in the other the traitor
King Louis of France.

54:29.799 --> 54:31.271
No exit.

54:31.306 --> 54:33.802
- We have no advantage.
- Your Majesty.

54:33.837 --> 54:38.638
Pope Innocent has gathered
300,000 ducats for Christianity.

54:38.673 --> 54:41.396
We could enroll many
men for that amount.

54:41.431 --> 54:46.129
300,000 ducats. Is not the same
than 300,000 soldiers.

54:46.164 --> 54:48.437
Ready to die for your God.

54:50.112 --> 54:52.396
How many men can we
count in Vienna?

54:52.643 --> 54:55.157
20, 30,000?

54:55.192 --> 54:56.943
No, your majesty.

54:56.978 --> 55:00.237
More or less ... not so many.

55:00.485 --> 55:03.678
If we put the militia together,
the police, the guards ...

55:03.713 --> 55:07.759
- the infantry regiment.
- To the point, how many men?

55:08.363 --> 55:12.070
I'd say about ... 15,000 men.

55:15.557 --> 55:17.147
Oh my God.

55:19.474 --> 55:20.861
Sir.

55:21.647 --> 55:23.182
Oh my God.

55:24.513 --> 55:26.613
What do you propose?

55:26.648 --> 55:29.021
Well, I propose that ...

55:29.056 --> 55:30.603
let's fight in the open.

55:30.638 --> 55:32.248
Showing him that we are not afraid.

55:32.617 --> 55:35.077
If Kará Mustafá arrives in Vienna ...

55:35.112 --> 55:37.470
will smell the blood and never
it will stop.

55:37.505 --> 55:39.691
What do you think they do?
Go away

55:40.107 --> 55:41.484
Outside.

55:43.133 --> 55:44.538
You said ...

55:44.707 --> 55:47.656
said to face them
in the open field.

55:48.745 --> 55:50.135
Not.

55:50.431 --> 55:53.162
No, Vienna is a great fortress.

55:53.197 --> 55:55.729
Why would we expose ourselves
at Discover?

55:55.764 --> 55:58.096
And with a number of men
so inferior.

55:58.952 --> 56:01.034
To control your movements ...

56:01.234 --> 56:03.297
If they besiege the city, we are ...

56:03.332 --> 56:05.361
destined to die.

56:05.619 --> 56:07.839
And that will be our faith.

56:07.874 --> 56:11.070
- If we stay here arguing ...
- My dear sister.

56:11.105 --> 56:13.558
- Good God, this is a miracle.
- What an amazing surprise.

56:13.593 --> 56:16.587
Let's not waste time with hugs.
Send a carriage.

56:16.622 --> 56:19.317
And bring Father Marco
back to Vienna.

56:19.838 --> 56:22.101
You can use his advice at
a moment like this.

56:23.916 --> 56:26.952
Sister, what we need now
they are weapons and men,

56:26.987 --> 56:29.106
- no advice.
- Listen to me.

56:29.904 --> 56:32.015
- I implore you, brother.
- I beg you.

56:32.304 --> 56:35.962
That man has ...
superhuman strength with him.

56:35.997 --> 56:38.738
Look at my face, my hands ...

56:38.773 --> 56:41.096
you remember how my body was.

56:41.896 --> 56:45.705
Look at me and tell me if it's not
a work of God.

57:01.557 --> 57:04.760
Raab River, Hungary.
Carlo di Lorena's camp.

57:07.496 --> 57:09.506
Hey, stop.

57:15.298 --> 57:18.285
Sergeant. What's going on?

57:18.320 --> 57:20.976
A sound of horses
from across the river.

57:21.011 --> 57:22.333
Thousands of horses.

57:22.368 --> 57:25.691
Come on, come on, everyone to the river!

57:25.726 --> 57:27.361
Quick, to the river!

57:27.396 --> 57:28.986
To the river, fast!

57:30.633 --> 57:32.175
Can you see them?

57:32.739 --> 57:34.429
What's going on?

57:36.088 --> 57:37.459
Silence.

57:55.008 --> 57:58.341
Oh good god
How many?

58:49.426 --> 58:52.492
Leopoldo is waiting for you,
your Majesty.

58:52.527 --> 58:56.148
We think it would be much more
prudent that your majesty

58:56.183 --> 59:00.219
will travel in a carriage
less ostentatious.

59:00.254 --> 59:02.592
It's fine.
That's OK.

59:02.627 --> 59:06.230
- What news do you have?
- They must have reached Father Marco.

59:06.265 --> 59:09.041
- God help us.
- So be it.

59:09.076 --> 59:10.612
Hurry, there's no time
to lose.

59:10.862 --> 59:13.888
- Aren't you coming, sister?
- Father Marco will return.

59:14.080 --> 59:16.096
I will not abandon Vienna.

59:16.131 --> 59:17.574
As you like.

59:55.126 --> 59:58.184
Father, finally.
His Majesty needs you.

59:58.219 --> 01:00:00.148
The Ottoman army
approaches Vienna.

01:00:00.394 --> 01:00:02.963
Your Majesty does not need
of my help.

01:00:02.998 --> 01:00:04.566
You need God's help.

01:00:09.004 --> 01:00:10.610
Hurry, move!

01:00:10.645 --> 01:00:12.229
Come up, quick!

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:14.258
Hurry, let's go!

01:00:28.345 --> 01:00:31.562
Vienna, Austria, July 14, 1683

01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:45.927
See for yourself, Father.

01:00:49.481 --> 01:00:52.218
May the holy virgin help us.

01:00:52.568 --> 01:00:54.383
I can not believe it.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.073
How many?

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:57.706
They arrived at dawn.

01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:00.477
Guided by Kará Mustafá,
he is the new Grand Vizier.

01:01:02.372 --> 01:01:04.012
Kará Mustafá?

01:01:04.725 --> 01:01:06.169
Do you know him?

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:11.027
I met him ... many years ago.

01:01:12.666 --> 01:01:14.346
How many men do you have

01:01:14.381 --> 01:01:17.072
About 15,000 well armed.

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.443
From the South, Eugenio will join us
Sevoia in two or three days

01:01:20.478 --> 01:01:22.835
with 1000 Italian lancers.

01:01:23.523 --> 01:01:27.818
And then another 20,000 will come
barbarian men.

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:31.083
10,000 from Franconia ...

01:01:31.476 --> 01:01:34.571
together, maybe
about 50,000 men.

01:01:34.606 --> 01:01:36.555
50,000?

01:01:38.307 --> 01:01:40.485
And the King of Poland?

01:01:40.839 --> 01:01:44.351
He promised that he would join ...

01:01:44.386 --> 01:01:46.478
at least 40,000 men.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.947
I'm afraid that the King of Poland
He could not keep his promise.

01:01:51.982 --> 01:01:54.124
We are alone, Count.

01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:55.707
We're alone.

01:02:00.567 --> 01:02:02.379
God help us.

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:16.608
You speak the language of the infidels.
It is not true?

01:02:18.216 --> 01:02:20.316
It is as it says, my lord.

01:02:24.316 --> 01:02:26.626
It is written in the Koran ...

01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:29.437
that before destroying the infidels ...

01:02:29.472 --> 01:02:33.456
it is correct to give them the opportunity
to redeem himself.

01:02:35.697 --> 01:02:37.379
Tomorrow at dawn ...

01:02:37.414 --> 01:02:39.261
You will announce it to them.

01:02:51.742 --> 01:02:54.421
- Secure all your positions.
- Count, count.

01:02:54.456 --> 01:02:56.037
Come watch.

01:03:02.059 --> 01:03:06.762
Recognize true faith ...
and pay tribute.

01:03:07.576 --> 01:03:10.761
They will save their bodies and their souls.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:19.872
Recognize true faith and
pay the tribute.

01:03:21.392 --> 01:03:24.071
They will save their bodies and their souls.

01:03:33.998 --> 01:03:38.070
- Recognize true faith ...
- What does it say?

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.936
They will save their bodies and their souls.

01:03:44.136 --> 01:03:45.672
Is incredible.

01:03:45.707 --> 01:03:48.003
He is asking us to surrender.

01:03:48.682 --> 01:03:51.537
Recognize true faith ...

01:03:51.572 --> 01:03:53.045
and pay the tribute.

01:03:53.768 --> 01:03:56.280
They will save their bodies and their souls.

01:03:56.551 --> 01:03:58.073
Oh no.

01:04:00.584 --> 01:04:03.164
Recognize true faith ...

01:04:03.199 --> 01:04:04.844
and pay the tribute.

01:04:04.879 --> 01:04:07.756
They will save their bodies and their souls.

01:04:08.414 --> 01:04:12.859
Recognize true faith
and pay the tribute.

01:05:06.845 --> 01:05:09.519
What you say is
very true, my lord.

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:13.063
But I never know
too cautious.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.749
I suggest you dig a ditch ...

01:05:19.784 --> 01:05:21.477
at the foot of the mountains.

01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:25.962
And fill it with traps
for the horses of the enemies.

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:29.484
Let's stop talking nonsense.

01:05:29.519 --> 01:05:32.637
No one can bring horses and
canyons to the mountains.

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:36.076
I humbly apologize,
Grand Vizier.

01:05:36.111 --> 01:05:38.484
But we cannot exclude
possibility

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:41.874
that Christians can attack us
precisely in Kahlenberg.

01:05:42.759 --> 01:05:45.115
And if the Grand Vizier agrees ...

01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:48.116
I suggest we move away
to this territory.

01:05:48.151 --> 01:05:49.516
Not.

01:05:51.104 --> 01:05:53.479
The Grand Vizier is not
agree.

01:05:58.495 --> 01:06:02.566
We will locate our entire army
looking at the walls of Vienna.

01:06:03.614 --> 01:06:06.113
And we will start digging tunnels.

01:06:09.272 --> 01:06:10.999
And soon...

01:06:11.575 --> 01:06:14.987
our crescent flag
will float ...

01:06:15.219 --> 01:06:17.151
from this same spiral.

01:06:17.186 --> 01:06:18.562
My Sir...

01:06:20.058 --> 01:06:22.926
our informant tells us
that the King of Poland ...

01:06:22.961 --> 01:06:24.763
he is marching with his army
to Vienna.

01:06:24.798 --> 01:06:27.875
They have seen our camp,
Grand Vizier.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:30.675
This can only mean
that the king of Poland has decided

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:33.299
come to the call of the troops.

01:06:33.334 --> 01:06:35.535
Old Sobieski.

01:06:36.047 --> 01:06:37.693
Do not be ridiculous.

01:06:37.862 --> 01:06:41.356
With due respect,
Grand Vizier Kará Mustafá ...

01:06:41.391 --> 01:06:43.369
we think it may be a mistake ...

01:06:43.404 --> 01:06:45.965
leave Kahlenberg defenseless.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.181
And thus underestimate everything
the people of Poland.

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:51.583
It could be even worse.

01:06:51.618 --> 01:06:54.902
Jan Sobieski is old ...

01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:56.432
and sick.

01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:02.543
You have difficulty walking.

01:07:02.578 --> 01:07:04.842
And you have to load it up
His horse.

01:07:08.239 --> 01:07:11.442
Sobieski would never leave his country.

01:07:14.577 --> 01:07:18.489
And by the time that
find out about our attack ...

01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:21.855
all the churches in Vienna ...

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:24.662
they will have become mosques.

01:08:23.773 --> 01:08:25.240
Have begun.

01:08:25.432 --> 01:08:28.303
God help us.

01:08:28.812 --> 01:08:30.319
Ready!

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:33.848
Fire!

01:08:40.688 --> 01:08:42.675
Fire Fire!

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:49.367
Quick, move!

01:08:56.136 --> 01:08:58.578
Take the Father down!
Protect yourselves.

01:08:58.613 --> 01:09:01.723
Quick, down.
Faster Faster.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.895
Quick!

01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:30.044
Fire! Keep shooting!

01:09:45.354 --> 01:09:47.225
Fire!

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.598
Go with the Count.

01:09:53.633 --> 01:09:55.296
Give me a hand, quick.

01:09:55.331 --> 01:09:58.280
Hurry over there!
With the others.

01:10:01.382 --> 01:10:03.260
That, take them inside.

01:10:03.295 --> 01:10:04.719
There, take them there.

01:10:04.754 --> 01:10:06.648
No no no. You stay here.

01:10:06.892 --> 01:10:09.470
I'll be fine.
It is just a scratch.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:12.919
You have a lot of blood.
Lie down

01:10:13.224 --> 01:10:14.918
Just for tonight.

01:10:24.029 --> 01:10:26.509
They will have a very raw awakening.

01:10:27.838 --> 01:10:30.675
They say they only have 15,000 men.

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:33.165
I think it will be easier
than we think.

01:10:37.382 --> 01:10:39.528
Hey, you, stop!

01:10:39.563 --> 01:10:40.925
Get back here!

01:10:41.793 --> 01:10:43.873
- Catch him! Catch him!
- Over there!

01:10:43.908 --> 01:10:45.709
Don't let it escape!

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.006
- To the!
- Over there, catch him!

01:10:50.006 --> 01:10:51.376
Stop it!

01:10:54.486 --> 01:10:57.315
Be careful, he has a knife!

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.661
Allah is with us.

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:07.133
Is a woman.

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:15.795
Check this out!

01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:25.311
Why did they call me?

01:11:25.346 --> 01:11:27.371
This infidel slipped away
in the camp.

01:11:37.445 --> 01:11:39.751
This problem does not concern me.

01:11:49.426 --> 01:11:51.242
I don't know this woman.

01:11:51.277 --> 01:11:54.560
Well. Then you won't mind
that we put it with the women

01:11:54.595 --> 01:11:57.026
to satisfy the soldiers.

01:12:04.265 --> 01:12:07.915
Allah is my witness ...
that I don't know this woman.

01:12:14.339 --> 01:12:15.931
Be careful with her!

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:29.111
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing.

01:12:29.146 --> 01:12:31.784
- She's praying to her God.
- Stop moving.

01:12:39.103 --> 01:12:40.616
Enters!

01:12:44.257 --> 01:12:47.609
Vienna, Austria.
August 9, 1683

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.060
So...

01:12:56.788 --> 01:13:00.508
according to the prediction,
half of us will die, Count.

01:13:16.896 --> 01:13:18.213
OMG.

01:13:18.397 --> 01:13:20.489
I heard noises upstairs.

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:23.688
Come with me.
Come on, quick.

01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:30.192
Get out, everyone get out!

01:13:30.424 --> 01:13:32.432
Quick, get everyone out!

01:13:35.337 --> 01:13:36.725
Quick!

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:42.059
Get up.
Wake up everyone.

01:13:42.094 --> 01:13:43.981
Get ready, come on, stand up.

01:13:45.782 --> 01:13:48.592
Get up!
All standing.

01:13:48.627 --> 01:13:50.635
Standing, standing.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.905
To the walls, hurry!

01:14:17.272 --> 01:14:19.727
Look for the other men,
Quick!

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:23.874
Over there, keep shooting!

01:14:41.282 --> 01:14:43.455
Watch out! Hold on!

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:50.169
Don't let them go up! Fire!

01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.679
Quick, move!

01:15:21.803 --> 01:15:24.894
- Retreat to camp!
- Don't let them escape!

01:15:31.585 --> 01:15:34.147
We will not be able to
hold much more.

01:15:34.182 --> 01:15:35.598
Count, look over there.

01:15:38.586 --> 01:15:40.456
I do not think so.

01:15:40.491 --> 01:15:42.545
- What's hidding?
- Look.

01:15:50.318 --> 01:15:54.066
It is the black madonna.
My king is coming.

01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:55.817
My king is coming!

01:15:56.114 --> 01:15:57.478
Yes!

01:15:58.254 --> 01:16:00.108
My king is coming!

01:16:00.724 --> 01:16:02.070
Yes!

01:16:29.458 --> 01:16:30.763
Open up.

01:16:36.401 --> 01:16:38.439
Move. Make room.

01:16:39.005 --> 01:16:40.330
Your.

01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:51.302
You can go.

01:17:07.203 --> 01:17:09.836
Fighting for faith is not enough.

01:17:10.108 --> 01:17:12.114
Not even for Muslims.

01:17:35.135 --> 01:17:38.265
Linz, Austria. Imperial Palace.

01:17:40.442 --> 01:17:42.684
At last, it was time.

01:17:44.844 --> 01:17:47.492
Welcome among us,
Commander Sobieski.

01:17:48.886 --> 01:17:53.254
Gentlemen, I declare open
the Council of War.

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:57.294
We want to discuss command
of the sacred union.

01:17:57.329 --> 01:18:02.535
We find it inappropriate that
that command be given to Sobieski ...

01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:06.632
- who is not of noble origin.
- Right, he's just a soldier.

01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:09.718
We Prince of Alvaria
we also feel awkward

01:18:09.753 --> 01:18:13.472
deliver such a command
to a simple general.

01:18:13.507 --> 01:18:15.974
You promised 40,000 men.

01:18:16.009 --> 01:18:19.991
Our informants tell us
that his men are barely 20,000.

01:18:20.286 --> 01:18:24.189
Impossible.
We cannot trust him.

01:18:25.308 --> 01:18:27.168
- Promises are promises.
- Absolutely.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:30.349
What is the opinion of our
young Lieutenant Eugene of Sevoia?

01:18:30.647 --> 01:18:35.136
Excellency, I brought 1,000 lancers
Italians with me.

01:18:35.354 --> 01:18:38.512
Ready to die in defense
of the Christian faith.

01:18:39.032 --> 01:18:41.127
Whoever sends in
the holy alliance...

01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:43.971
we are here to fight.

01:18:44.006 --> 01:18:47.215
We could end up in a
sure defeat.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:51.539
60 ... just 60,000 men
against 300,000.

01:18:52.179 --> 01:18:53.841
It can only mean one thing.

01:18:55.168 --> 01:18:56.611
The defeat.

01:18:57.131 --> 01:19:00.789
- What does it say, Sobieski?
- I say...

01:19:01.984 --> 01:19:06.418
that I'm not willing to stay
in this room one more moment ...

01:19:07.002 --> 01:19:10.635
unless they guarantee me
the command of the sacred union.

01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:13.301
We are not here to be
threatened by the allies.

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:15.217
Speak, Father Marco, you
he is a man of God.

01:19:16.082 --> 01:19:18.331
I pray that I find a solution.

01:19:19.011 --> 01:19:24.468
Your Majesty ... why you
insist on taking command?

01:19:27.124 --> 01:19:29.810
Because I know how to win
this battle.

01:19:29.845 --> 01:19:32.262
That is a simple presumption,
Sobieski.

01:19:32.297 --> 01:19:35.447
A serious sin for him
Christian who claims to be.

01:19:35.482 --> 01:19:38.541
Make silence.
Gentlemen, silence, please.

01:19:40.632 --> 01:19:42.727
Let's hear what the
Father Marco has to say.

01:19:45.897 --> 01:19:49.830
Your Majesties, Excellencies,
I am just a poor monk.

01:19:50.775 --> 01:19:53.080
And I don't know anything about
strategies.

01:19:53.295 --> 01:19:57.941
Neither of plans of attacks, but
I do know that Vienna represents ...

01:19:57.976 --> 01:20:00.220
the survival of the
Christendom.

01:20:01.891 --> 01:20:05.035
I know that if they have faith, they will win.

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:07.618
If they stick together ...

01:20:07.819 --> 01:20:09.422
will win.

01:20:11.324 --> 01:20:15.703
If the King of Poland says that
knows how to win this battle ...

01:20:16.936 --> 01:20:19.177
let me explain.

01:20:19.212 --> 01:20:21.605
- Okay, let's listen.
- I'm curious.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.869
Well ... this is my plan.

01:20:23.904 --> 01:20:25.480
Let's hear his great plan.

01:20:25.515 --> 01:20:29.812
We will attack the Turks
from where they least expect it.

01:20:29.848 --> 01:20:32.072
Really? And where is that?

01:20:32.107 --> 01:20:33.782
For Kahlenberg!

01:20:35.237 --> 01:20:37.109
But it is not possible.

01:20:37.144 --> 01:20:40.092
There is no way to transport
the horses and cannons up there.

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:44.342
True. How do you propose that we take
the armament to the top of Kahlenberg?

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:48.035
- There are no roads.
- Don't listen to this man.

01:20:48.451 --> 01:20:51.126
- Silence!
- It is questionable.

01:20:51.286 --> 01:20:53.726
Silence, in the name of God.

01:20:54.736 --> 01:20:56.039
Listen.

01:20:56.437 --> 01:20:59.485
Listen carefully
every word you say.

01:21:00.014 --> 01:21:03.633
We will reach the top of
that damn mountain ...

01:21:04.178 --> 01:21:05.984
and from up there ...

01:21:06.019 --> 01:21:10.218
my cannons will send to hell
to the muslim camp.

01:21:11.118 --> 01:21:13.146
And I personally

01:21:13.181 --> 01:21:15.579
I will load from Kahlenberg ...

01:21:15.614 --> 01:21:19.206
at the head of my cavalry ...

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:21.833
and we will destroy ...

01:21:21.868 --> 01:21:24.081
the army of Kará Mustafá.

01:21:38.397 --> 01:21:40.195
Did you call me, Grand Vizier?

01:21:41.226 --> 01:21:43.445
Could you recognize it?

01:21:46.586 --> 01:21:48.098
It is him, my lord.

01:21:50.059 --> 01:21:52.264
I want to meet him.

01:21:56.233 --> 01:21:58.490
Can I ask why,
Grand Vizier?

01:22:04.813 --> 01:22:07.106
I want to discover ...

01:22:07.141 --> 01:22:09.896
why Allah made me
save his life.

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:13.196
When do you plan to do it?

01:22:14.412 --> 01:22:15.873
Now...

01:22:17.478 --> 01:22:19.189
tonight.

01:22:32.632 --> 01:22:34.266
There is.

01:23:25.293 --> 01:23:30.172
I would show him his wolf fang,
but I left it to my son.

01:23:30.207 --> 01:23:32.431
As proof that I would return.

01:23:33.512 --> 01:23:36.562
There is no need, Kará Mustafá.

01:23:37.073 --> 01:23:39.302
I recognize you even in
Darkness.

01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:44.486
Why ... did you want to meet
with me?

01:23:48.445 --> 01:23:52.937
My informants tell me
what should I fear ...

01:23:52.972 --> 01:23:55.321
much more than
Leopold's Generals.

01:23:57.184 --> 01:23:59.306
I have no weapons.

01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:01.443
I can only pray to God.

01:24:05.089 --> 01:24:06.895
Which God?

01:24:07.087 --> 01:24:09.616
He who we believe knows ...

01:24:09.832 --> 01:24:12.636
who will die between the two of us.

01:24:13.332 --> 01:24:15.821
The true God.

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:20.311
The one who made you save my life
Many years ago.

01:24:25.084 --> 01:24:28.859
Allah ... made me save his life.

01:24:28.894 --> 01:24:32.392
So that I could kill him tomorrow ...
in Vienna.

01:24:32.529 --> 01:24:37.474
God made it so that I could
be here to save your life.

01:24:39.392 --> 01:24:43.373
Do you want to save my life ... monk?

01:24:43.408 --> 01:24:47.008
More, I want to save your soul.

01:24:50.121 --> 01:24:52.619
Withdraw your army.

01:24:53.267 --> 01:24:54.873
He's crazy

01:24:55.585 --> 01:24:57.975
Tomorrow we will defeat them.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:01.067
And I will personally cut you
head with my scimitar.

01:25:01.102 --> 01:25:06.021
Save your life and your soul,
Kará Mustafá.

01:25:06.056 --> 01:25:07.883
Our God is merciful.

01:25:07.918 --> 01:25:10.542
It's never too late
to ask for your forgiveness.

01:25:10.577 --> 01:25:11.916
Never.

01:25:20.542 --> 01:25:22.540
I will win, monk.

01:25:23.714 --> 01:25:26.174
But, if for some reason,
I am defeated,

01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:28.486
the West will not have
place for bliss.

01:25:28.521 --> 01:25:32.002
Because his victory only
will further strengthen the prophet.

01:25:33.749 --> 01:25:36.296
And not many springs will pass ...

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:39.516
before another Grand Vizier
introduce yourself ...

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:41.374
at the gates of Vienna.

01:25:42.084 --> 01:25:45.095
And all of Europe will have
than submitting to Allah.

01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:48.734
The true God does not need
submission.

01:25:49.918 --> 01:25:52.369
He wants men to be free.

01:25:53.034 --> 01:25:55.658
To love him again.

01:25:56.299 --> 01:25:58.323
You will still die, monk.

01:25:59.042 --> 01:26:00.812
Embrace your lambs.

01:26:00.997 --> 01:26:03.228
And Allah will judge you and forgive you.

01:26:04.644 --> 01:26:06.093
God is great.

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:10.745
Let's leave that decision to Him.

01:26:12.538 --> 01:26:14.530
We cannot take your place.

01:26:16.354 --> 01:26:18.393
Inshallah, Marco.

01:26:19.016 --> 01:26:22.316
Inshallah, Kará Mustafá.

01:26:59.472 --> 01:27:02.305
Vienna, Austria.
September 11, 1683

01:27:28.592 --> 01:27:31.868
In a few hours, Vienna will leave
to exist.

01:27:32.649 --> 01:27:34.475
And this day ...

01:27:34.994 --> 01:27:38.044
will be remembered for centuries ...

01:27:38.079 --> 01:27:41.915
like the day of the greatest
Islamic victory.

01:28:05.011 --> 01:28:06.961
My brothers!

01:28:08.918 --> 01:28:12.203
Soon ... they will have to fight.

01:28:14.028 --> 01:28:17.424
They will have to kill others
human beings.

01:28:18.555 --> 01:28:20.850
When that time comes ...

01:28:22.152 --> 01:28:24.771
when they must kill or
get them killed ...

01:28:24.806 --> 01:28:26.894
remember my words.

01:28:28.166 --> 01:28:31.514
They are fighting not only
for defending Vienna,

01:28:31.549 --> 01:28:36.673
but also to defend
their faith and their traditions.

01:28:38.385 --> 01:28:42.909
They are defending their
wives and children.

01:28:43.631 --> 01:28:48.447
To her sisters! Your brothers!

01:28:48.482 --> 01:28:50.215
Their mothers and fathers!

01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:51.691
Why...

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:56.437
if Vienna falls ... Rome will fall.

01:28:57.646 --> 01:29:00.194
And if Rome falls ...

01:29:01.362 --> 01:29:03.834
Holy Mother Church will fall.

01:29:04.443 --> 01:29:06.607
Defend your faith!

01:29:07.772 --> 01:29:11.851
So your children can
be free to embrace God!

01:29:12.044 --> 01:29:15.420
Free to love Christ!

01:29:16.332 --> 01:29:21.371
Free ... because you
they fought this day!

01:29:25.719 --> 01:29:28.528
Repeat after me!

01:29:29.704 --> 01:29:33.764
I believe!

01:29:33.963 --> 01:29:38.037
I believe with all my heart!

01:29:38.483 --> 01:29:41.820
I believe with all my heart!

01:30:11.938 --> 01:30:14.889
Come on, put all your strength!

01:30:14.924 --> 01:30:17.417
Those cannons have to
reach the top.

01:30:33.344 --> 01:30:34.967
Push harder.

01:30:35.002 --> 01:30:37.212
Move, they are very slow.

01:30:37.247 --> 01:30:38.937
Push those cannons.

01:31:02.464 --> 01:31:06.743
What are they doing? It should embarrass them
leave your king in this mess.

01:31:06.999 --> 01:31:09.134
Your Majesty, leave him with us.

01:31:09.135 --> 01:31:10.574
Leave me!

01:31:10.909 --> 01:31:13.893
Quick, get him up, come on!

01:31:19.206 --> 01:31:20.908
Stop it!

01:31:37.489 --> 01:31:40.808
What are we going to do, Your Majesty?
Shall we look for it again?

01:31:40.843 --> 01:31:43.638
Leave it where it is.
We cannot stop.

01:31:43.673 --> 01:31:45.207
Go on, go on.

01:32:29.422 --> 01:32:32.009
They are at the top.
Prepare to attack.

01:33:11.885 --> 01:33:14.240
We are true believers.

01:33:14.976 --> 01:33:17.308
Since the beginning of time.

01:33:22.649 --> 01:33:24.622
We are very numerous ...

01:33:24.657 --> 01:33:27.040
they can't tell us
with the fingers of your hands.

01:33:29.394 --> 01:33:32.445
We will conquer the
Golden Apple.

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.109
Fire, for heaven's sake!

01:34:46.301 --> 01:34:47.956
Mister Duke.

01:34:48.579 --> 01:34:50.144
Look over there.

01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:56.609
Jesus Christ. It is Kará Mustafá.

01:35:20.062 --> 01:35:21.672
The King of Poland.

01:35:22.264 --> 01:35:24.825
Where's the King of Poland !?

01:35:33.424 --> 01:35:36.307
Withdrawal!

01:35:40.107 --> 01:35:42.211
They are withdrawing their army.

01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:46.393
He is taking them into the water.

01:35:51.547 --> 01:35:53.670
Our troops are getting
withdrawing.

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.076
We are lost

01:36:08.051 --> 01:36:11.254
There's someone on top
from Kahlenberg.

01:36:12.101 --> 01:36:14.063
I can see it, Grand Vizier.

01:36:16.856 --> 01:36:19.254
He is holding a cross.

01:36:19.463 --> 01:36:20.848
Hukor!

01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:25.862
Change of plans.

01:36:26.882 --> 01:36:29.315
Turn your cannons towards
the mountain.

01:36:29.875 --> 01:36:33.841
Turn the cannons towards the mountain!
Quick!

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:39.182
Here is the cross of the Lord!

01:36:39.591 --> 01:36:43.138
Here is the cross of the Lord!

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:48.046
Here is our Savior!

01:36:48.081 --> 01:36:50.867
Get out of there, Marco. Let's go.

01:36:53.978 --> 01:36:55.610
How weird.

01:36:56.234 --> 01:36:57.857
No wind.

01:36:59.674 --> 01:37:02.560
And the Kahlenberg trees
they seem to move.

01:37:11.245 --> 01:37:12.770
Not.

01:37:17.602 --> 01:37:19.163
Fire!

01:37:30.962 --> 01:37:32.448
Fire!

01:37:50.765 --> 01:37:54.508
Cover up, they're shooting
from Kahlenberg!

01:38:06.483 --> 01:38:08.390
Come on, don't stop!

01:38:09.221 --> 01:38:12.083
Fire, fire, fire!

01:38:15.471 --> 01:38:18.134
The Grand Vizier!
We must protect the Grand Vizier!

01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:19.937
We must save him!

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.143
- Are you afraid?
- No, father.

01:38:56.899 --> 01:38:59.048
It is your first challenge.

01:38:59.749 --> 01:39:02.153
Don't be ashamed of
be afraid.

01:39:04.613 --> 01:39:07.239
Go forward, in the name of God!

01:39:28.691 --> 01:39:31.531
It is attacking.
Sobieski is attacking.

01:39:31.566 --> 01:39:34.561
He comes with his army!
We are saved!

01:39:34.596 --> 01:39:36.587
Vienna is saved!

01:39:38.087 --> 01:39:41.388
The King of Poland is attacking
from Kahlenberg.

01:39:41.423 --> 01:39:45.898
Defend from your flank.
What are they waiting for?

01:39:57.387 --> 01:39:59.240
Where they are going?

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.694
Don't go there!

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:04.102
Go the other way!
Go!

01:40:07.438 --> 01:40:09.594
Back back!

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:11.833
Back, come on!

01:40:13.889 --> 01:40:15.562
Go ahead!

01:40:15.829 --> 01:40:17.883
Go there!

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:54.922
Look for Kará Mustafá!

01:41:54.957 --> 01:41:57.204
It can't be far.

01:41:57.239 --> 01:41:58.824
There it is, sir!

01:42:00.474 --> 01:42:02.640
I do not think so.

01:42:20.755 --> 01:42:22.267
Fire!

01:42:42.328 --> 01:42:44.589
We killed Kará Mustafá.

01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:53.904
Damn you, Kará Mustafá.

01:43:21.311 --> 01:43:23.392
They will be with God.

01:44:20.663 --> 01:44:22.219
Oh, Abul.

01:44:22.875 --> 01:44:24.341
God.

01:44:25.148 --> 01:44:27.251
God!

01:44:36.299 --> 01:44:39.778
Belgrade December 25, 1683

01:44:52.255 --> 01:44:53.639
My Sir...

01:44:57.389 --> 01:44:58.946
have arrived.

01:45:05.063 --> 01:45:07.940
To their posts.
Protect the Grand Vizier.

01:45:07.975 --> 01:45:09.440
Ready.

01:45:22.973 --> 01:45:25.127
Move, move.

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:43.668
I am proud of you, father.

01:45:43.703 --> 01:45:46.434
I am proud to be the son
by Kará Mustafá.

01:46:15.712 --> 01:46:19.135
At least take my son.

01:46:19.170 --> 01:46:21.387
It is not possible, my lord.

01:46:21.595 --> 01:46:26.137
The Sultan personally ordered
that the child must witness his death.

01:46:42.093 --> 01:46:44.104
Allah is my witness.

01:46:44.392 --> 01:46:46.776
That I fought for Him ...

01:46:46.811 --> 01:46:49.257
and the triumph of true faith.

01:46:54.842 --> 01:46:57.915
Observe the death of the Grand Vizier, my son.

01:46:57.987 --> 01:46:59.464
Observe.

01:47:00.221 --> 01:47:02.293
And never forget it.

01:47:03.012 --> 01:47:04.452
Never.

01:48:19.052 --> 01:48:20.715
Bravo!

01:48:20.867 --> 01:48:25.347
Bravo!

01:48:25.615 --> 01:48:29.712
Bravo!

01:48:31.817 --> 01:48:33.601
Bravo!

01:48:50.241 --> 01:48:53.510
For Luigi and Bruna, wherever they are.
