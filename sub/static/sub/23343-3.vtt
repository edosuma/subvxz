[ Buzzer sounds,

00:33.567 --> 00:34.902
Maybe a little time in here

00:34.935 --> 00:37.171
will help you think about
what you did, Watterson.

00:37.205 --> 00:40.074
[ Buzzer sounds,

00:42.543 --> 00:45.613
Hello. You're
Julius Oppenheimmer Jr., right?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.848
I'm Darwin. We met last year
in the school yard.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.084
Are you the one who screams
when his arms come off?

00:50.118 --> 00:51.685
Mnh-mnh.
Are you the one who

00:51.719 --> 00:53.387
passes out when he's held
upside

00:53.421 --> 00:54.722
Nope!
Are you the one who has

00:54.755 --> 00:56.257
trouble walking
when his legs are pulled off

00:56.290 --> 00:57.691
then put back on
the wrong way around?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.428
I'll give you a clue --
two weeks of physiotherapy

01:00.461 --> 01:02.196
and a forever-whistling
nose.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.537
Oh, yeah!

01:09.570 --> 01:11.205
You hang out with the
blue one with the big head

01:11.239 --> 01:12.640
who I turned inside-out.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.375
So, how come you're
in dental

01:14.408 --> 01:16.710
It's called "detention,"
and I'm here 'cause I had

01:16.744 --> 01:20.248
a little trouble
with my art project.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.318
"Vandalism"?
Detention!

01:24.352 --> 01:25.919
And what are you in for?

01:25.953 --> 01:27.121
Same sort of thing.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.491
"Vandalism is bad"?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.993
Admirable sentiment,
but still vandalism.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.128
Detention!

01:34.162 --> 01:35.829
So, what do you do
in detention?

01:35.863 --> 01:38.065
Well, I was gonna start
with a bit of popping.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.134
Popping?
Man, I love breakdancing!

01:40.168 --> 01:41.569
Then I guess
some mauling.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.404
Going to the mall?
Uh-huh!

01:43.437 --> 01:45.239
And to finish,
some trampling.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.740
They have
a trampoline now?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.243
Aw, man!
Detention sounds great.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.478
I guess they must be
going for

01:50.511 --> 01:52.413
a Scandinavian-rehabilitation
approach.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.348
You're pretty naive.

01:54.382 --> 01:55.916
I bet you're easy
to manipulate.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.084
I'll do it!

01:57.117 --> 01:58.319
What?
Oh, sorry.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.920
I thought you wanted me
to do something.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.822
Would -- would you like me
to do something?

02:01.855 --> 02:03.191
Hold that thought.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.625
[ Line rings,
voice speaks indistinctly ]

02:04.658 --> 02:06.294
I got one.
He'll do whatever I say,

02:06.327 --> 02:07.595
and we'll never get
in trouble again.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.597
He's a real sucker.
How do I know?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.200
Because he's holding
the phone for me right now.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.001
Want to come hang out
with a bunch of older kids

02:14.034 --> 02:17.004
who have a reputation for being
mean and manipulative?

02:17.037 --> 02:18.038
Do I?

02:18.071 --> 02:19.207
Yes, you do.
Yes, I do!

02:19.240 --> 02:20.541
He's perfect.
Let's go.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.178
Wow! You guys
are so friendly.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.315
It's almost, like, too friendly,

02:27.348 --> 02:29.016
but of course
there's no such thing.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.384
So, what are your names?

02:30.418 --> 02:32.653
I'm Reaper.
I'm Scythe.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.721
And I'm Phillip.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.789
No, dude,
that's your real name.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.057
And I'm Mowdown.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.527
Reaper, Scythe and Mowdown.
Cool nicknames.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.795
So, I guess you're
from farming families,

02:41.829 --> 02:44.698
or really into
agriculture or something?

02:46.234 --> 02:47.535
Told you he was perfect.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.403
So, do you guys have
a secret handshake?

02:49.437 --> 02:51.739
I got one you
can have -- look!

02:53.374 --> 02:55.843
Then the other guy goes...

02:55.876 --> 02:59.813
Then -- that bit obviously works
better if there's two butts.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.649
He's beyond perfect.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.752
He's the unicorn of fools --
the foolicorn.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.321
And I can make him
do anything.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.923
Hey, go clean out
that old woman's purse.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.743
Hmm?

**

03:42.556 --> 03:43.857
All cleaned out.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.626
Okay, we'll
try something else.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.561
Get a $1,000 worth
of pizza delivered

03:47.595 --> 03:48.929
to the police precinct

03:48.962 --> 03:51.365
with extra bacon.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.268
Got it!

03:55.436 --> 03:58.138
-Pizza delivery!

03:58.171 --> 03:59.973
Ah-ah!

04:00.007 --> 04:01.275
Ah!

04:01.309 --> 04:03.711
Wait. Why is that
cop waving at us?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.713
Because of your generosity.
What do you mean?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.548
When the pizza place
asked who it was from,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.550
I said you and luckily
they already had

04:09.583 --> 04:10.884
your credit-card details!

04:10.918 --> 04:13.387
It was supposed to be
cash on delivery.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.055
How is that
a prank otherwise?!

04:15.088 --> 04:18.726
Well, it is kind of a prank,
just not on them.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.828
Hey, guys.
Thanks for the pizzas,

04:20.861 --> 04:22.896
although to make sure
it doesn't look like a bribe,

04:22.930 --> 04:26.400
I'm going to have
to fine you for loitering.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.068
I'm having
a great time.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.071
Okay, guys, give me
one more chance to prove

04:31.104 --> 04:32.473
he's an easy mark.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.475
Er, my name's "Darwin" --
just saying.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.578
Okay, you see
that nice, clean van over there?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.246
You're gonna cover
it in dirt.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.482
Right away.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.854
Wow! She looks great!

04:46.887 --> 04:49.289
I was thinking Janice could
do with a little facelift.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.424
Here.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.659
Thank you, sir.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.594
I guess the money
should go to the boss.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.195
-Thanks.
-Yo, who's to say

04:55.228 --> 04:56.530
I'm not the boss?
Or me?

04:56.564 --> 04:57.931
Yeah, you're
not the leader.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.433
You don't have
what it takes.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.335
Oh yeah?
Well take this!

05:01.369 --> 05:02.770
Owwww!

05:02.803 --> 05:04.137
Didn't hurt.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.539
I love you

05:05.573 --> 05:07.140
this much!
Ignore that!

05:07.174 --> 05:08.376
I hate you this much!

05:08.409 --> 05:11.111
-Why you...

05:11.144 --> 05:12.780
Stop!

05:12.813 --> 05:13.781
Why?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.949
Because you guys
got to get along,

05:15.983 --> 05:19.052
and what better way
than with a song?

05:19.086 --> 05:21.789

fun will never end *

05:21.822 --> 05:24.492

on the time you sp-- *

friend of mine.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.829
Hey! Come back here!

05:28.862 --> 05:30.130
You're not
the boss of us.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.665
You can't even
convince a little kid

05:31.699 --> 05:34.635
to do a single bad thing.

05:34.668 --> 05:38.038
Aw. I had another 23 things
that rhymed with "Friend."

05:38.071 --> 05:39.807
I'll show them.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.643
I'm the master manipulator.
I can make you do anything.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.478
Come on, let's jam.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.414
[ Bangs car rhythmically,
beatboxes ]

Just come in
whenever you like.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.720
**

05:52.753 --> 05:55.523
Okay, you're gonna go
and leave a little surprise

05:55.556 --> 05:57.190
in the pool...

05:57.224 --> 05:58.358
using this detergent.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.660
But trespassing is wrong.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.094
It's one of
the seven sins --

06:01.128 --> 06:04.598
along with pride, wrath,
Sleepy, Dopey, Blitzen --

06:04.632 --> 06:06.767
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
It's not trespassing

06:06.800 --> 06:09.236
if it's for
a good cause, heh.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.771
Why is this
a good cause?

06:10.804 --> 06:14.107
Because every child deserves
access to clean water?

06:14.141 --> 06:15.342
That is the most

06:15.375 --> 06:16.844
charitable thing
I've ever heard!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.579
Okay, how am I gonna
do this?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.213
Just use your head,
kid.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.415
Okay!

06:21.449 --> 06:23.283
What are you doing?!

06:23.316 --> 06:25.252
Using my head.
Here, use this.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.021
Thank you.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.557
Why did you do that?!

06:29.590 --> 06:31.024
To pay for the damage
to the door.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.060
No, it was
to open the door.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.728
It's got my name
and address on it.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.864
Oh, cool, then they'll
be able to return it.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.398
Come here.
We got to get it back.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.368
On the count of three, I'll lift
it up and you drop and roll.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.037
One, two, three.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.873
No, you're supposed
to go in and get --

06:45.906 --> 06:47.074
Aah!!

06:47.107 --> 06:48.275
Give me your phone.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.410
My friend has hurt his foot,

and he needs
medical assistance.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.280
Who is that?
911.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.616
Are you crazy?!
Don't worry.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.551
I'm not gonna be all like,
"Oh, yeah, my friend

06:57.585 --> 06:59.953
Julius Oppenheimmer Jr.
who lives on Park Road

06:59.987 --> 07:02.623

to trespass at the public pool."

Man: What?!

07:03.991 --> 07:06.059
I mean, "This is
an anonymous call"!

07:06.093 --> 07:08.228
You just gave them
my name and address!

07:08.261 --> 07:09.763
Aah -- anonymously.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.732
And they can trace
the call!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.467
Not anymore.
My phone!

07:14.635 --> 07:16.470
Just help me
get my foot out!

07:18.338 --> 07:20.140
Thanks for nothing!

07:22.943 --> 07:24.845
Aah, they're coming!
You got to help me.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.581
Oh, no,
they're gonna see us!

07:27.615 --> 07:29.416
Quick, let's kiss
to hide our faces.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.084
It always works
in spy movies.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.120
No, no, no, no, no!

07:34.221 --> 07:35.422
Sorry.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.924
I'm fine.
And given the choice,

07:36.957 --> 07:38.792
I'd take this option
again.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.263
No, no, no -- I can't --
I can't walk much further.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.165
I'm gonna need some wheels.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.767
Go and take someone's
bike or something.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.436
Wait, that sounds like
another bad thing.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.272
Well, if you do this
one bad thing now,

07:52.305 --> 07:54.942
we can do two good things
later to make up for it.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.511
You mean like how the Romans
invaded half of the world,

07:57.545 --> 07:59.613
but then invented sandals
and ice cream?

07:59.647 --> 08:01.181
I don't think the Romans
invented ice cream.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.617
Okay just sandals then,
there's two of them.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.985
Ahh, just
get on with it.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.654
Yes. Sorry.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.723
I commandeer this vehicle!

08:11.992 --> 08:14.127
Dude! That was
my girlfriend!

08:15.162 --> 08:17.297
Quick! Let's kiss
before she sees you.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.001
Julius, a text would
have been enough.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.537
No, no, no! Wait!
Debbie, I can explain!

08:23.571 --> 08:25.305
Aah!

08:26.740 --> 08:28.141
What have you done?!

08:28.175 --> 08:30.844
I've lost my girlfriend,
my crew,

08:30.878 --> 08:33.547
the police are after me,
they've got my address,

08:33.581 --> 08:36.149
my parents
will be mad at me.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.718
You've ruined me!

08:37.751 --> 08:39.587
Who would've thought
my life could've been destroyed

08:39.620 --> 08:41.321
by a dumb sucker
who lives in a world

08:41.354 --> 08:42.489
of kittens and rainbows?

08:42.522 --> 08:45.893
Julius, stop.
You're not making sense.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.895
In a world of
kittens and rainbows,

08:47.928 --> 08:50.197
what would
the kittens eat?

08:50.230 --> 08:53.033
Just go.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.034
N

08:54.067 --> 08:55.869
Immediately.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.439
No! I'm gonna fix this.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.942
Wait for me at the bus stop
in half an hour.

09:01.975 --> 09:08.348
**

09:08.381 --> 09:09.583
All fixed!

09:09.617 --> 09:11.685
Really
Well, first...

09:11.719 --> 09:13.020
I spoke to your friends,
and they all agreed

09:13.053 --> 09:14.387
that you had to
stick together

09:14.421 --> 09:16.523
after I told the Bikers
your crew declared

09:16.556 --> 09:18.458
war on them.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.061
What

09:21.094 --> 09:22.596
Wait, what?
The Bikers?

09:22.630 --> 09:26.199
Yeah, and then I patched
things up with your girlfriend.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.901
You're getting married
on Saturday.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.805
Oh! I also fixed
the situation with the police.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.874
Oh, let me guess --
by making my life worse?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.076
No -- by making
your father's life worse.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.779
I told them that it was
Julius Oppenheimmer Senior

09:38.812 --> 09:40.547
who tried to
break into the pool.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.049
Oh!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.717
Were the coupons
expired?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.218
What?
My Dad's been arrested?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.220
My Mom's gonna go nuts
when she finds out!

09:47.254 --> 09:49.056
She won't.
She's being deported.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.390
But why?!

09:50.423 --> 09:53.226
I changed her passport
to one from Switzenburgenstan.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.261
That's not even a country!

09:54.294 --> 09:55.763
Which is why they're
going to dump her

09:55.796 --> 09:57.831
in unchartered waters
right about now.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.332
Thank you
for flying with us.

10:00.634 --> 10:04.504
You've made
everything worse.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.505
What?

10:05.538 --> 10:07.507
It was a joke!

10:07.540 --> 10:08.909
What

10:08.942 --> 10:11.344
No! Now who's easy
to manipulate?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.246
And don't worry,
I fixed everything

10:13.280 --> 10:14.614
with your crew
and your girlfriend.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.183
Oh.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.418
Well, I guess this shows
if you bully someone enough,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.688
it'll eventually backfire
so spectacularly

10:20.721 --> 10:23.090
that it'll teach you
a valuable life lesson.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.191
Which is...?

10:24.224 --> 10:26.794
I should bully
even more people

10:26.827 --> 10:28.195
to learn extra life lessons.

10:28.228 --> 10:31.098
What? No!
The lesson is...

10:31.131 --> 10:34.267
Oo-o-oh! You made a joke!

10:35.869 --> 10:38.271
Look, man, I'm sorry.
You're no sucker.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.774
And you're right,
the world needs more buddies,

10:40.808 --> 10:41.875
not more bullies.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.043
Want to hug it out?

10:43.076 --> 10:45.545
As long as there's
no kissing.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.380
Oh, but wait.
What about my parents?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.782
Are they still mad at me?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.383
Not after they get
the cake you sent them.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.785
What?
Mm-hmm.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.553
The one with "Sorry"
spelled out in sparklers?

10:53.586 --> 10:56.189
Thanks, buddy.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.126
Huh?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.961
You did good, kid.
You did -- wait.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.096
Did you just say
a cake with sparkl--

11:04.164 --> 11:15.542
**

11:15.575 --> 11:26.820
**

11:26.854 --> 11:38.298
**
