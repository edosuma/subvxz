00:58.850 --> 01:00.643
[both grunting]

01:11.237 --> 01:12.489
[gasps]

01:19.579 --> 01:21.122
He knows where our hideout is!

01:21.206 --> 01:24.959
 -We can't let him get back to Gunmar!
-He's heading toward Arbor Street.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.213
-Tell me you put up signs there.
-I thought you did.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.049
[alarm blaring]

01:31.716 --> 01:34.302
Better make this quick
before the neighborhood finds out.

01:34.385 --> 01:35.553
[coughs] I got it.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.556
Wait, don't use your-- [groans]

01:38.640 --> 01:40.892
-[man] Hey! Shut that thing off!
-[Jim panting]

01:48.441 --> 01:50.652
-Oh, no.
-[growls]

01:52.904 --> 01:54.614
-You okay?
-Don't slow down for me.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.298
Ha-ha!

02:12.382 --> 02:16.219
-[growls]
-Eat my geomancy, Gumm-Gumm swine!

02:18.805 --> 02:20.723
Uh, Blinky, you've got the wrong sign!

02:20.807 --> 02:25.478
[gasps, screams]

02:29.232 --> 02:32.652
-[gasps]
-What's going on out here? Huh?

02:33.319 --> 02:34.154
What the...?

02:34.237 --> 02:39.617
If only Arcadia knew your mom's campaign
was actually keeping them safe.

02:39.701 --> 02:44.706
The signs are no real defense, Master Jim.
Merely a Gumm-Gumm deterrent.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.166
Judging from tonight,

02:46.249 --> 02:49.544
I don't know how much longer
your sleepy little town will be safe.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.755
That Gumm-Gumm,
you think he was once one of you?

02:52.839 --> 02:57.385
Hmm. Gunmar turn friends. Sad.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.429
[Toby] We can't think that way, guys.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.141
He saw where we were hiding the trolls.
He would've told Gunmar.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.518
And since he's taken the Heartstone,

03:05.602 --> 03:08.897
he has only grown stronger,
making his defeat even more difficult,

03:08.980 --> 03:10.732
if not impossible.

03:13.401 --> 03:17.572
[grunts] For weeks, Gunmar's been sending
his minions to do his dirty work.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.116
Why doesn't he come up himself?
What's he waiting for?

03:20.199 --> 03:24.329
Sadly, that is the question
Arcadia's fate hangs upon.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.998
What is Gunmar plotting next?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.960
[coughing]
Well, this stalemate is torture.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.881
I don't know how many more of these
late night study sessions I have in me.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.424
[Aaarrrgghh] Hmm.

03:36.507 --> 03:41.679
-Hey! You look just like a Gumm-Gumm.
-[Aaarrrgghh] Yes.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.892
-No. Too risky. You can't spy on Gunmar.
-We lost you once, old friend.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.185
 We cannot lose you again.

03:47.268 --> 03:50.813
Gunmar strong!
Do nothing, Gunmar grow stronger!

03:50.897 --> 03:52.148
My choice!

03:52.232 --> 03:55.610
It would be a waste of a hulking brute.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.738
You get in, you get out.
No unnecessary risks.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.656
[whimpering]

04:00.240 --> 04:02.575
Mm. Wingman.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.577
[bell tolling]

04:04.661 --> 04:08.248
There's our cue. We shall head
back to our refuge. Will you be joining?

04:08.331 --> 04:12.627
Go on. I wanna enjoy the sunrise
while we still have 'em.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.800
[Jim breathes deeply]

04:20.843 --> 04:23.763
[yawns, groans]

04:24.472 --> 04:25.682
[loud clattering]

04:30.228 --> 04:31.229
[clattering continues]

04:35.566 --> 04:37.443
-[Jim gasps]
-Oh, hey, hon!

04:37.527 --> 04:41.864
Uh... Mom? What are you doing home?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

04:41.948 --> 04:46.661
-Oh, gosh. I must've lost track of time.
-Are you painting?

04:46.744 --> 04:49.122
[chuckles] Well, if you can call it that.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.833
Come on, don't sell yourself short.
I'm sure--

04:51.916 --> 04:56.713
-Whoa! Whoa! No, no, no, no, no.
-Is it that bad?

04:56.796 --> 05:00.258
No, no. It's-It's, uh...
It's-It's thought-provoking.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.427
[sighs] I don't know what came over me.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.679
I had this vivid dream last night

05:04.762 --> 05:07.390
and woke up
with the urge to express myself.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.225
So, I'm painting.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.435
You-- You dreamed this?

05:10.518 --> 05:12.729
Better get going.
I can drive you to school

05:12.812 --> 05:17.400
-on my way to the hospital.
-Actually, I promised Claire I'd walk her.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.277
 [chuckles] I was just on my way.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.988
Oh. And they say chivalry is dead.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.702
-Oh, no.
-[Claire] Her memory's coming back?

05:27.785 --> 05:31.122
I wonder if she remembers her epic romance
with Strickler. [grunts]

05:32.332 --> 05:34.709
Ugh. I don't even want her
to know he's back.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.461
[coughing]

05:36.544 --> 05:39.464
Claire, I told you not to use
your Shadow Staff.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.383
You've had that cold
since you opened that giant portal.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.801
It's just a cold. [sniffles]

05:43.885 --> 05:46.179
I've survived the Darklands.
A little cold won't--

05:46.262 --> 05:49.098
[sneezes] Maybe I'll take a little break.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.559
Get that thing off of my lawn!

05:51.642 --> 05:54.687
Uh, it's okay, sir.
I'm Councilwoman Nuñez's daughter.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.231
She wants support
to keep the neighborhood crime-free.

05:57.315 --> 06:01.486
If you don't get that sign out of here,
the crime rate's about to go up!

06:01.569 --> 06:04.489
Geez, mister! It's just a sign.
Everyone else has got one.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.699
I am running against her!

06:06.783 --> 06:09.494
-Hammes is my name!
-Gotta go!

06:09.577 --> 06:11.204
-Let's cheese it.
-[Jim] Let's go!

06:11.287 --> 06:12.580
Sorry you're gonna lose!

06:12.663 --> 06:14.582
-[man] Why, I oughta--!
-Ahh! Time to go!

06:14.665 --> 06:17.085
-[man] Come back here, you...
-[Claire] ¡Hasta luego!

06:17.168 --> 06:19.879
[man] I will chew you up and spit you out!

06:45.863 --> 06:47.532
[grunts, growls]

06:48.491 --> 06:49.325
[growls]

06:58.668 --> 07:01.295
-Report.
-Our scouts never returned.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.213
[growls]

07:10.012 --> 07:10.847
[growls]

07:10.930 --> 07:14.100
Instead of seeking the hole
the traitors cower in,

07:14.183 --> 07:17.353
we should storm the surface
and seize the humans' weaponry.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.771
Use it against them.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.733
They have explosives that level cities,
ripe for the taking.

07:22.817 --> 07:27.238
And then what?
We're only as strong as the night lasts.

07:27.321 --> 07:31.576
Every dawn will decimate our forces,
giving the humans the advantage.

07:31.659 --> 07:36.247
But that will change
when we bring forth the Eternal Night.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.165
[Aaarrrgghh gasps]

07:37.248 --> 07:40.042
[Gunmar] Dictatious,
has she spoken to you?

07:40.126 --> 07:44.589
Of course! Just last night,
the Pale Lady gave me a vision

07:44.672 --> 07:47.508
of the human Trollhunter
dead at your feet.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.426
And?

07:48.509 --> 07:54.056
And... your allies mourned him
from inside your stomach

07:54.140 --> 07:56.976
because you ate them. [laughs]

07:57.059 --> 08:00.104
This tells me nothing!

08:00.188 --> 08:05.151
[grunts] The Eldritch Queen swore
I would usher in the Eternal Night,

08:05.234 --> 08:07.653
but she never told me how.

08:07.737 --> 08:13.242
 I found my strength, regained my army.
She speaks through you.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.828
-So, tell me.
-[Usurna coughs] Gunmar.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.748
Perhaps she will tell you
when the time is right.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.043
-[grunts]
-No! Please!

08:22.627 --> 08:23.628
[sighs]

08:23.711 --> 08:25.463
[grunts, coughs]

08:25.546 --> 08:26.380
Leave.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.800
[Dictatious whimpering]

08:29.884 --> 08:31.802
[Aaarrrgghh] Oh...

08:35.264 --> 08:36.097
[growls]

08:39.727 --> 08:43.523
Thank you for your timely intervention.
As of late, the Pale Lady--

08:43.606 --> 08:46.567
Ugh! "The Pale Lady."
"The Eldritch Queen."

08:46.651 --> 08:49.070
Why don't you just call her
by her real name?

08:49.153 --> 08:51.405
-Morga--
-No! Her name is cursed!

08:51.489 --> 08:54.825
Oh, save it!
She and your visions are a farce!

08:54.909 --> 08:57.870
How dare you say her words are a lie!

08:57.954 --> 09:01.082
What words? I've never heard a whisper
from that phonograph,

09:01.165 --> 09:02.375
and neither have you.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.920
Oh. If you know,
then why did you defend me?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.506
We all want Gunmar to take the world back,

09:08.589 --> 09:12.927
but he is waiting on a superstition
to guide him, when it should be us.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.429
You want to work together?

09:16.180 --> 09:21.060
"Want" is overstating it.
If we don't, it'll be our heads!

09:21.143 --> 09:22.937
 -Ugh!
-[school bell ringing]

09:23.521 --> 09:24.647
[coughs, sneezes]

09:24.730 --> 09:28.109
Ugh! Okay, Nuñez, that time
I was not out of the blast radius.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.111
-Sorry.
-You need to take the night off.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.028
Not happening.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.824
It's my turn for night watch,
and no one needs to carry my-- [sneezes]

09:34.907 --> 09:38.077
-Oh, my goodness. That's so gross.
-You're working way too hard.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.579
 Remember, life's a balance.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.581
-Ugh!
-[Darci] T.P., over here!

09:41.664 --> 09:44.333
-[gasps] Hey, G.F.
-Hey, um...

09:44.750 --> 09:46.586
Oh! Uh...

09:46.669 --> 09:49.297
-[chuckling] Uh... Um...
-Uh...

09:49.380 --> 09:50.923
Okay, okay.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.260
Look at the hot sauce that showed up
on our front door, C-Bomb.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.221
He's from Arcadia Oaks Academy.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.140
[indistinct chatter]

09:59.932 --> 10:00.766
Hmm.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.937
-Is that Big D?
-[grunts]

10:06.022 --> 10:06.856
[sighs]

10:14.113 --> 10:15.865
"C-Bomb," is it?

10:15.948 --> 10:20.578
Consider me blown away,
because you are nuclear.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.705
-[chuckles]
-So, uh...

10:22.788 --> 10:24.582
what brings you to our humble school?

10:24.665 --> 10:27.251
-And what'll it take to send you back?
-[coughs]

10:27.335 --> 10:30.504
The Battle of the Bands is coming up.
Ash Dispersal Pattern,

10:30.588 --> 10:33.215
 that's my band, will be crushing it,

10:33.299 --> 10:35.468
but we're encouraging others
to give it a shot.

10:35.551 --> 10:40.139
[gasps] Didn't you open up for Papa Skull
at the Boxtop? You were sick! [sneezes]

10:40.222 --> 10:42.683
[chuckles] Well,
it looks like I'm not the only one.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.394
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles sarcastically]

10:45.478 --> 10:46.979
Claire, we should enter.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.024
We could be a cover band.
Call ourselves... Oh, oh!

10:50.107 --> 10:51.984
-Mama Skull!
-[chuckles]

10:53.569 --> 10:55.154
I don't know. You know, really?

10:55.237 --> 10:59.325
Mama Skull? I don't know, I don't know.
I mean, it's the end of the school year,

10:59.408 --> 11:04.497
and we're already pretty booked up
with all those after-school activities.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.414
[chuckles]

11:06.248 --> 11:09.418
Actually, a friend of mine told me
I needed more balance.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.337
-Count us in.
-Ka-boom!

11:11.420 --> 11:12.713
Shotgun on vocals!

11:12.797 --> 11:15.925
I look forward to seeing you again,
fair Lady Claire.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.426
[chuckles]

11:23.849 --> 11:28.854
[Strickler] This is going to be different
from your usual training, Young Atlas.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.855
[breathing heavily]

11:29.939 --> 11:32.775
[Strickler] You will need to learn
to let go.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.611
No more holding back.

11:35.694 --> 11:40.825
Release what's inside of you.
These are the dark magics.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.540
Good. You're learning.

11:47.998 --> 11:51.377
There's a little more fight
in you today, Young Atlas.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.295
I don't wanna talk about it. [grunts]

11:53.379 --> 11:58.092
Still feeling bad about hiding
our lessons from Blinkous?

11:58.175 --> 12:00.428
I don't think he would approve
of your methods.

12:00.511 --> 12:06.016
-Blinkous wouldn't understand.
-Hey, you call this training? Whoa!

12:06.100 --> 12:08.060
[Strickler] I'm not trying to train you!

12:10.062 --> 12:11.939
I'm trying to kill you!

12:12.940 --> 12:17.528
[grunts] To kill Gunmar,
you'll need to fight like Gunmar.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.738
You won't win by playing fair.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.740
[both grunting]

12:21.824 --> 12:24.743
Again, what is the code of changelings?

12:24.827 --> 12:25.661
Rule one.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.746
There's honor among assassins.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.914
Rule two!

12:28.998 --> 12:33.002
Rule one is a lie.
There's no such thing as honor. [grunts]

12:33.085 --> 12:34.670
Rule number three?

12:34.753 --> 12:37.882
Everything and everyone
is a tool to get what you want.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.676
And I want... to kill Gunmar.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.511
[screams]

12:42.595 --> 12:44.263
[panting]

12:44.346 --> 12:45.556
[Strickler groaning]

12:49.393 --> 12:52.021
Hey, are you okay?

12:54.064 --> 12:57.610
-Whoa!
-You can't even save yourself.

12:57.693 --> 13:01.280
How can you possibly
save your friends or your family?

13:01.363 --> 13:02.198
[yells]

13:02.281 --> 13:05.784
Don't push out the darkness.
Embrace that rage.

13:05.868 --> 13:10.539
Let it fuel you.
Your humanity is your weakness.

13:14.043 --> 13:14.877
[grunts]

13:19.381 --> 13:21.175
[Nomura] Use the darkness, Trollhunter.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.428
[gasps]

13:28.057 --> 13:31.644
[Strickler] Same time tomorrow,
Trollhunter?

13:31.727 --> 13:32.561
[growls]

13:32.645 --> 13:36.273
He's not ready.
His humanity will get him killed.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.694
[Blinky] Take this sustenance.
Let it sustain you, my brethren.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.739
Something seems
to be troubling you, Master Jim.

13:43.822 --> 13:44.657
Um...

13:45.533 --> 13:47.743
-I know what it is.
-Uh, you do?

13:47.826 --> 13:51.247
Apologies, I haven't had
any time for your training.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.749
As you can see,
my four hands have been full.

13:53.832 --> 13:58.837
-[farting]
-Ah! That is not a toilet, Plagsnork! Ugh!

13:58.921 --> 14:01.799
I tell you,
they don't listen to me, Master Jim.

14:01.882 --> 14:05.344
I used to think Vendel's cantankerous
nature made him a difficult leader,

14:05.427 --> 14:09.223
but now I see
it was only a form of survival.

14:09.306 --> 14:13.519
No worries, Blink. Training can wait.
[stammers] I'll manage.

14:13.602 --> 14:17.523
♪ A-tisket, a-tasket
A sockey in a basket ♪

14:17.606 --> 14:21.193
-What color you got for me?
-Sadly, only white remain.

14:21.277 --> 14:25.114
What's the point of comin' down here
when all the free swag is a drag?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.616
When you gonna take out
the big bad bossman?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.202
This ain't no fit life for a troll.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.830
How long you expect 'em
to live in this dump?

14:32.913 --> 14:35.082
-Hey, I'm working on it, okay?
-[gate opening]

14:35.165 --> 14:37.167
[all screaming]

14:37.251 --> 14:38.586
[screaming]

14:40.921 --> 14:41.755
[chuckles]

14:41.839 --> 14:44.842
Aaarrrgghh! Ha! You're back!
What word did you bring, old friend?

14:44.925 --> 14:48.554
Two words. Eternal Night.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.849
-[gasps]
-Just how bad are those words?

14:51.932 --> 14:53.267
Oh, the very worst.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.812
The mere reason we locked Gunmar
in Killahead was that he was trying

14:56.896 --> 14:59.815
to bring... [hushed] the Eternal Night.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.776
The time where trolls
would reclaim the surface from mankind.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.905
The good news is
that the Eternal Night is just a lore,

15:05.988 --> 15:10.034
a myth used as a rallying cry
to unite trolls against humans.

15:10.117 --> 15:14.288
Gunmar doesn't actually know how to bring
such calamity, does he, Aaarrrgghh?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.874
No. But searching.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.959
Okay, then we have time on our side.

15:19.043 --> 15:23.213
Aaarrrgghh, you did well, but I need you
back there to be our ear to the ground.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.925
-Can you do that?
-Glad to.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.846
[Barbara] So, you've had this cold
for two weeks. Any other symptoms?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.431
Yeah, to be honest,

15:32.514 --> 15:35.142
I've been tired all the time
and spacing out.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.062
According to my tests,
you're in absolute perfect health.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.150
I think we can chalk this up
as a case of teenage-itis. [chuckles]

15:43.233 --> 15:44.485
This happens a lot.

15:44.568 --> 15:49.156
Finals are approaching, and you kids think
everything is the end of the world.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.659
If you only knew.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.663
-Thanks, Dr. Lake. That's a relief.
-[chuckles] Please, it's "Barbara."

15:57.081 --> 16:01.835
How are things with you and Jim?
Every time I ask, he gets tongue-tied.

16:01.919 --> 16:02.753
It's good.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.630
He's great.

16:04.713 --> 16:08.008
Well, that's because he's surrounded
by great women. [chuckles]

16:08.634 --> 16:10.844
Take care of yourself, Claire.
Get some rest.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.680
Thanks again, Barbara.

16:12.763 --> 16:13.597
I will.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.270
Master Jim, thought you could use this.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.356
I managed to scrounge up
all the components

16:22.439 --> 16:24.483
for brewing a fine cup of coffee.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.903
Except I had to use
someone's old gym sock for the filter.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.281
I know. I'm not a fan
of the French roast either.

16:31.365 --> 16:35.327
-How goes the watch?
-It's given me time to think, Blinky.

16:35.411 --> 16:40.457
This Gunmar stuff and...
the Eternal Night.

16:40.541 --> 16:44.962
-What if I don't have it in me to stop it?
-We've discussed this before.

16:45.045 --> 16:49.383
-Your heart is stronger than you know.
-What if heart isn't enough?

16:49.466 --> 16:54.638
This is Gunmar. He's ruthless.
He-- He doesn't show mercy.

16:54.722 --> 16:58.100
Yes, Gunmar is savage,
and that's precisely why

16:58.183 --> 17:01.603
we left his violent ways
and searched for a new path.

17:03.105 --> 17:08.318
Master Jim, as our Trollhunter,
you have been, eh, awful.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.946
So many times,
making horrible, horrible mistakes.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.366
Hey, I'm trying my best.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.035
Precisely.

17:16.117 --> 17:21.415
And that is why I would follow you
to the ends of the earth.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.709
You are human.

17:24.376 --> 17:30.132
You grow. You learn from your mistakes.
You always try to make the right choice.

17:30.215 --> 17:34.970
Unlike Gunmar,
I believe we trolls can grow with you.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.308
Let's hope you're right.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.227
[gasps] The signs. Where'd they all go?

17:44.772 --> 17:45.939
[Jim] What just happened?

17:48.567 --> 17:49.735
[bushes rustling]

17:50.736 --> 17:52.738
[gasps] Jim!

-Oh, no. For the glory of Merlin...

17:59.078 --> 17:59.995

18:00.079 --> 18:02.581
We've been compromised!
We must defend our ground!

18:03.082 --> 18:05.000
[banging]

18:05.084 --> 18:08.796
Trolls, stand with me! For tonight, we...

18:11.090 --> 18:12.966
-Whatever.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.530
-Avant! Ah!
-[Jim grunts]

18:35.781 --> 18:36.865
Whoa!

18:39.576 --> 18:41.078
[panting]

18:41.161 --> 18:44.540
-There's too many of them, Master Jim.
-We have to get them all--

18:46.208 --> 18:47.918
[laughing]

18:48.961 --> 18:51.964
I told you this husk
wouldn't stop coming after you.

18:52.047 --> 18:56.844

-But you let Draal live. Now you will die!

19:24.538 --> 19:26.456
-[laughs]
-[grunts]

19:26.540 --> 19:28.458
I don't want to fight you.

19:28.542 --> 19:32.296
Are you comin' or not?
Time to make like pea soup and split!

19:32.379 --> 19:35.382
No. I'm sorry. I must help Master Jim!

19:36.842 --> 19:38.135

19:41.096 --> 19:42.055
[metal creaking]

19:42.639 --> 19:44.683
You stole this world from us!

19:45.893 --> 19:48.270
The time of man is at an end!

19:48.979 --> 19:51.481
Only one can rule the earth!

19:51.565 --> 19:53.567
[grunting]

19:56.111 --> 19:57.738
[Gunmar] The night is coming.

19:57.821 --> 19:58.906
[metal creaking]

20:01.408 --> 20:04.286
The Eternal Night is inevitable!

20:04.369 --> 20:08.457
And I'll still be there to fight you,
Gunmar, if you ever show your face.

20:14.379 --> 20:18.300
You can't hide forever. [sniffing]

20:21.178 --> 20:23.680
Your humanity will be your undoing.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.558
You should have killed Draal
while you had the chance.

[Gunmar] Do it, Trollhunter!

21:00.926 --> 21:03.887
If you think your armor's too much
to shoulder today,

21:03.971 --> 21:07.140
I'll make sure it'll break you tomorrow!

21:07.224 --> 21:10.727
I found you once.
I will find you again. Kill him!

Master Jim, we must leave at once.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.115
You cannot escape me.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.367
[voice echoing] I'll find you!

21:25.951 --> 21:31.123
There must be something substantial
in here I can use to tide over Gunmar.
