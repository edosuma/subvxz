00:02.373 --> 00:04.682
<i>Will, academic probation is serious.</i>

00:04.853 --> 00:06.252
<i>How could you let this happen?</i>

00:06.653 --> 00:08.405
It's Professor Burton's fault.

00:08.573 --> 00:12.009
He used to be such an easy grader
until him and his wife got a divorce.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.249
Then he became impossible.

00:14.413 --> 00:18.486
The last test he gave,
I got a four, and I cheated.

00:21.693 --> 00:24.526
No, this is horrible.

00:24.773 --> 00:28.004
Hey, hey, Professor Burton, I hope
that ain't my essay you're reading.

00:28.213 --> 00:30.329
Hey, Will. No, I haven't gotten
to yours yet.

00:30.493 --> 00:32.085
I'll finish them tonight...

00:32.253 --> 00:34.926
...right after I move
the last of my things out of our...

00:35.093 --> 00:37.323
Her garage.

00:37.533 --> 00:41.367
Hey, look, well, have mercy on me, man.
You know, I'm on academic probation.

00:41.573 --> 00:44.246
Now, Will, I like you,
but I have to be objective.

00:44.413 --> 00:46.005
When I'm at here the university...

00:46.173 --> 00:49.483
...I can't let my personal feelings
influence my professional behavior.

00:50.533 --> 00:53.001
I guess I won't be needing
that anymore.

00:54.973 --> 00:56.247
Look, man.

00:56.413 --> 00:58.847
Look, I usually keep this
on a need-to-know basis.

00:59.013 --> 01:01.846
But you look like
you really need to know.

01:03.773 --> 01:06.412
Behold. My chicktionary.

01:08.213 --> 01:10.647
- A little black book, huh?
- Oh, yes, sir.

01:11.213 --> 01:13.408
What are these letters
next to the girls' names?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.370
Oh, those are grades.

01:16.453 --> 01:17.966
There's a lot of F's.

01:18.133 --> 01:21.125
That ain't necessarily a bad thing,
you know?

01:23.613 --> 01:27.606
- What's the B mean?
- Be prepared for a possible F.

02:36.933 --> 02:38.525
Hi, Will.

02:38.933 --> 02:40.332
Hey, look, I'll be right back.

02:40.493 --> 02:45.521
Oh, and G.G.W.A.B.
Means Good God What A Booty.

02:46.973 --> 02:49.328
- What are you doing here?
- I need to switch cars.

02:49.493 --> 02:52.565
- Carlton said you have the keys.
- Cool. What's wrong with your car?

02:52.733 --> 02:56.328
I'm going shoe shopping,
I need the wagon. Bye.

03:00.533 --> 03:03.684
- Who is that?
- Hilary? Oh, that's my cousin.

03:04.213 --> 03:08.286
- Well, is she involved with anyone?
- Mostly just herself.

03:11.253 --> 03:13.892
Oh, you... You know, she...
She was just telling me today...

03:14.093 --> 03:17.449
...how much she could really use
a man in her life.

03:17.613 --> 03:19.171
And...

03:19.333 --> 03:20.846
You a man.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.808
Oh, good. Check it out.
I got an idea:

03:23.973 --> 03:26.203
Why don't you come over
our house tonight, right.

03:26.373 --> 03:30.082
- And I'll introduce y'all.
- Will, I really appreciate this.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.285
A woman like her
could really lift my spirits.

03:34.893 --> 03:37.851
Maybe she could do the same
for my grade.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.052
Hey, everybody.

03:42.493 --> 03:45.929
I just bought Nicky a brand new crib.

03:47.773 --> 03:50.207
"The Crib Chalet
has over 100 features...

03:50.373 --> 03:52.443
...including
automatic guardrail-extension...

03:52.613 --> 03:55.491
...infrared climb-out sensors
and a built-in busy box.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.570
Some assembly required."

03:57.893 --> 03:59.565
Oh, no.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.648
Carlton, my boy,
go put on your work clothes.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.251
Help me.

04:06.413 --> 04:10.088
- I'm not gonna miss a minute of this.
- Here, darling.

04:10.253 --> 04:13.609
Philip, I know what's gonna happen.
He's gonna start in on your nerves...

04:13.773 --> 04:16.161
...you're gonna end up at his throat.
- Oh, nonsense.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.403
This is a perfect time
for a father and son...

04:18.572 --> 04:21.769
...to spend some quality time together.
Geoffrey, go fetch my tools.

04:21.933 --> 04:24.493
You mean your knife and fork?

04:31.613 --> 04:32.966
Hey, Hil, you got a second?

04:33.133 --> 04:34.691
- Sure.
- All right.

04:36.253 --> 04:41.088
<i>Sweet Savage Lust.
One of the classics, huh?</i>

04:41.693 --> 04:43.570
It's about this rich, beautiful girl...

04:43.733 --> 04:46.008
...who loses her lover
in a terrible accident...

04:46.213 --> 04:49.603
...and spends her nights alone
mourning his death.

04:49.973 --> 04:52.726
Where do they get these stories?

04:53.413 --> 04:56.132
Hey, look, Hil...

04:56.293 --> 04:58.409
...you know,
Trevor's been gone for months now.

04:58.613 --> 05:02.083
- Don't you miss dating?
- Yeah.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.130
At first, I felt guilty for wanting to.

05:04.293 --> 05:08.491
But I think if Trevor were still alive,
he'd want me to see other guys.

05:10.573 --> 05:12.564
Exactly.

05:12.773 --> 05:14.764
Hey, wait right here.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.331
What are you doing?

05:19.413 --> 05:21.802
Hilary Banks. Scott Burton.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.211
"When a man is in love...

05:24.413 --> 05:27.086
...he endures more
than at other times.

05:27.253 --> 05:31.041
He submits to everything."

05:37.373 --> 05:41.252
Boy, don't make me have to turn
the hose on y'all two.

05:41.973 --> 05:43.725
- Will.
- Yeah?

05:43.893 --> 05:45.212
What's going on here?

05:45.413 --> 05:49.088
Well, Hil, I figured that y'all
might have something in common.

05:49.253 --> 05:51.767
I'm saying,
he's an English professor and...

05:51.933 --> 05:55.005
And you speak some English.

05:56.853 --> 05:58.081
Look, Steve...

05:58.253 --> 05:59.606
- Scott.
- Whatever.

05:59.773 --> 06:03.129
- I'm really sorry...
- No, I'm sorry.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.131
I was just so struck by your beauty
today, I had to meet you.

06:07.813 --> 06:09.451
I'm terrible at this kind of thing.

06:10.573 --> 06:13.167
You're not terrible.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.803
Shields are down, Scotty. Fire!

06:18.933 --> 06:22.608
I know this is last minute, but an artist
friend of mine gave me some tickets...

06:22.773 --> 06:25.571
...to a gallery opening in Venice.
- That's very nice, Scott.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.805
But don't you think Italy is more
of a second date kind of thing.

06:29.613 --> 06:32.002
No, I mean Venice Beach.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.207
Well, it sounds like fun.

06:35.413 --> 06:39.292
- Do I have time to change?
- Well, if you like, but...

06:39.613 --> 06:43.242
"True loveliness needs not
the foreign aid of ornament."

06:43.773 --> 06:45.968
Well, duh.

06:51.093 --> 06:53.288
Hold up, man, there's no tag on this.

06:53.453 --> 06:57.969
<i>I need a price check
on a Peacock athletic supporter.</i>

06:58.853 --> 07:01.845
<i>Size small.</i>

07:04.173 --> 07:06.243
<i>Never mind.</i>

07:06.453 --> 07:07.568
- Will.
- Oh, hey.

07:07.733 --> 07:10.566
I had the best time with Hilary.
Cannot wait to see her again.

07:10.733 --> 07:12.371
All right, man.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.127
Oh, and by the way.
I graded your essay this morning.

07:15.293 --> 07:19.605
The whole class did rather well,
but you, my friend, got a B-plus.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.049
Yes. I got a B-plus.

07:23.213 --> 07:25.408
I'm Will, call me.

07:26.893 --> 07:28.485
I also spoke with your counselor...

07:28.653 --> 07:31.213
...and he's agreed to take you off
academic probation...

07:31.373 --> 07:34.046
...provided you do well
on my midterm Friday.

07:34.213 --> 07:36.408
Hey, thanks a lot, man.

07:36.573 --> 07:39.133
Oh, but a big midterm on Friday...

07:39.293 --> 07:42.524
...means you're gonna have to spend
all weekend grading papers.

07:43.813 --> 07:47.692
I'll make the test one question,
open book.

07:48.933 --> 07:51.686
Welcome to the family, man.

07:55.373 --> 07:57.284
All right.

08:00.933 --> 08:03.572
Hey, you know what? Allow me.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.645
Will, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

08:06.813 --> 08:08.610
Hey, Jackie, I can explain.

08:08.773 --> 08:10.001
Explain what?

08:10.173 --> 08:13.404
How you're using your cousin
just to get yourself a good grade?

08:13.573 --> 08:15.450
Hey, look, Jackie, it ain't like that.

08:15.613 --> 08:17.205
I know you, Will.

08:17.373 --> 08:21.366
But I still burn with desire
for you, baby.

08:24.653 --> 08:26.883
Yo, Jackie. I'm just looking out
for number one.

08:27.053 --> 08:29.123
You know what I'm saying?
You know, you know.

08:39.173 --> 08:41.403
I don't know
who you've been talking to, Rhetta.

08:41.573 --> 08:44.565
But, no, I don't be giving
my dates grades.

08:44.773 --> 08:46.491
I'm saying, so, so...

08:46.653 --> 08:49.042
Are we gonna kick it
tomorrow night or what?

08:49.213 --> 08:53.286
I don't know. You know, do a little
somethin'-somethin'. Who knows?

08:54.013 --> 08:55.412
Are you with that?

08:55.573 --> 08:58.167
All right, I'll see you
tomorrow night then.

09:01.253 --> 09:04.165
Rhetta, B.

09:07.773 --> 09:10.970
I heard somebody
made a love connection.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.852
So tell me about your date.

09:15.693 --> 09:17.923
I have to admit it, Will,
you were right.

09:18.093 --> 09:19.731
I had fun last night.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.169
Oh, well, trust me,
you got dude flipping.

09:23.413 --> 09:24.846
I like him too.

09:25.013 --> 09:29.370
Hey, look, as long as you're going out
with Professor Burton, I am A-okay.

09:30.453 --> 09:33.525
- Then that presents a little problem.
- Why, what's up?

09:33.693 --> 09:35.923
Because I am never going
to see him again.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.691
Wait, whoa, wait, whoa, whoa.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.242
What do you mean you're
never going to see him again?

09:48.413 --> 09:50.881
You was just saying how dope he was.

09:51.053 --> 09:53.613
He has a mole.

09:56.933 --> 09:58.127
Hilary, wait a minute.

09:58.333 --> 10:02.042
I sit in class with this man all day,
every day, and I ain't ever seen no mole.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.368
I hardly noticed it too.

10:03.533 --> 10:07.128
But as the night went on,
it got bigger and bigger...

10:07.333 --> 10:09.528
...until it was all I could see.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.207
Oh, it was disgusting.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.132
Hey, Hilary, wait a minute.
You can't just dump this guy...

10:16.333 --> 10:18.324
...because of a tiny
physical imperfection.

10:18.533 --> 10:21.206
I mean, you ain't perfect yourself, girl.

10:22.493 --> 10:24.563
Oh, stop.

10:26.693 --> 10:30.527
Hilary, listen. Imperfections
are what make people special.

10:30.693 --> 10:34.163
Like in Philly, a big butt on a sister
was considered a thing of beauty.

10:34.373 --> 10:36.489
You know,
the more back baby got, the better.

10:36.693 --> 10:38.365
I mean, up to a point.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.603
Then, it's just nasty.

10:42.093 --> 10:45.244
But come on, Hil.
You gotta give this guy another chance.

10:46.653 --> 10:49.087
Telephone, Miss Hilary.
A Mr. Scott Burton.

10:49.253 --> 10:51.642
Oh, the mole man. Tell him I moved.

10:51.813 --> 10:53.451
Hilary.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.169
Oh, all right.

10:57.933 --> 11:01.562
Hello, Spot... I mean, Scott.

11:05.453 --> 11:08.126
Yeah, I had a nice time too.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.683
- Tomorrow night?
- Yes, yes.

11:11.413 --> 11:12.812
Sure.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.487
Okay. I'll see you then.

11:16.253 --> 11:19.404
Well, I did it. I just hope
I don't get nauseous and faint.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.884
Hey, hey, Hil, you know what?

11:23.053 --> 11:25.362
I got a date tomorrow night.
We could just double.

11:25.533 --> 11:26.648
What's that going to do?

11:27.453 --> 11:29.603
I don't know,
maybe take your mind off it.

11:29.773 --> 11:30.808
I'll work mole patrol.

11:32.293 --> 11:34.284
Thanks, Will, that's great.
You're the best.

11:34.493 --> 11:35.846
I'll call Scott and tell him.

11:36.013 --> 11:38.811
- Oh, where are we going anyway?
- The opera.

11:40.853 --> 11:43.765
Dad, we started this three days ago
and there's no end in sight.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.571
Let's pay someone to finish the job.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.849
Am I keeping you
from something more important?

11:48.013 --> 11:49.162
As a matter of fact, yes.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.006
I've got midterms and, eventually,
I'd like to move out...

11:52.173 --> 11:54.368
...get a full-time job and start a family.

11:54.773 --> 11:57.845
And when you do, I will help you
build one of these for your child.

11:58.013 --> 12:01.244
You won't, because I'll be smart enough
to pay someone to do it for me.

12:01.413 --> 12:04.962
And just how are you gonna do that
without a trust fund?

12:06.133 --> 12:09.284
Game, set, match.

12:09.573 --> 12:12.326
Now, stop whining. What's next?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.005
"Locate the red linchpin."

12:15.173 --> 12:16.526
Got it.

12:16.693 --> 12:18.809
"But do not remove it."

12:35.333 --> 12:37.847
Will, the lobster was superb.

12:38.013 --> 12:41.050
Yeah, they gypped us, though.
They only gave us the tails.

12:41.213 --> 12:45.001
Hilary, I got the feeling at dinner
that your attention was somewhere else.

12:45.173 --> 12:47.323
Why would you think that?

12:49.213 --> 12:50.726
This is our box.

12:56.613 --> 12:58.888
What is the matter with you?

12:59.093 --> 13:02.608
You are making a mountain
out of a mole, Hil.

13:05.733 --> 13:09.362
- The mole, I'm over that.
- Oh. Well, then, what's the problem?

13:09.573 --> 13:13.566
Did you see how huge
his Adam's apple is?

13:14.853 --> 13:16.002
I don't believe this.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.444
Every time he chewed,
it kept bouncing up and down...

13:19.613 --> 13:20.682
...and up and down.

13:20.853 --> 13:22.605
I mean, what's in there, a basketball?

13:23.573 --> 13:24.892
I can't look at him anymore.

13:25.053 --> 13:27.328
- I have to get out of here.
- Hilary.

13:27.493 --> 13:28.721
Listen.

13:28.893 --> 13:32.932
That is not a mole or an Adam's apple
that you're seeing.

13:33.093 --> 13:34.082
It's Trevor.

13:34.733 --> 13:39.887
You're telling me that Trevor
was reincarnated in Scott's throat?

13:41.533 --> 13:45.526
No, look, Hil, what I'm trying to say
is that you miss Trevor so much...

13:45.733 --> 13:48.167
...something inside of you
won't let go of him.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.130
If you walk out on Scott now...

13:50.293 --> 13:52.761
...this could haunt you
for the rest of your life.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.525
- What do you mean?
- Well...

13:54.733 --> 13:56.724
You might never go out again.

13:56.893 --> 13:58.884
You'll become one of them
crazy old women...

13:59.053 --> 14:02.284
...who walk around all day long
with a shower cap on...

14:02.813 --> 14:06.567
...with an old
raggedy halter-top that say "Jam."

14:10.733 --> 14:15.443
And then you gonna start
wearing rhinestone gauchos.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.810
And then, just for no reason,
you'll say:

14:25.693 --> 14:28.890
Then you'll be eating neckbone
sandwiches all the time.

14:29.053 --> 14:32.284
And screaming at your little
imaginary dog, Brutus.

14:33.813 --> 14:36.646
- And you know what the worst part is?
- What?

14:36.853 --> 14:40.846
The only man you're gonna be able
to get is some fool named Grady...

14:42.333 --> 14:45.848
...who be smelling like menthol all
the time and falling asleep in his soup.

14:46.013 --> 14:48.766
Oh, God, I hate soup.

14:49.693 --> 14:54.050
Then you march through those curtains
and you look his throat in the face!

15:06.533 --> 15:10.003
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

15:10.173 --> 15:12.607
Hey did we miss the national anthem?

15:19.533 --> 15:22.047
Some fool named Grady.

15:34.493 --> 15:36.290
Is Hilary okay?

15:36.453 --> 15:38.250
It seems like
something's bothering her.

15:38.413 --> 15:40.483
No, no, everything's cool, man.

15:40.693 --> 15:44.925
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
a turtleneck out in your car would you?

15:46.093 --> 15:48.653
We are trying to enjoy the opera.

15:48.853 --> 15:50.889
I know, it's hard ain't it?

15:57.133 --> 16:00.284
His neck is blocking my view.

16:01.013 --> 16:03.049
It's like watching a snake
digest a rabbit.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.328
Hilary.

16:04.933 --> 16:06.571
Listen, it is all in your head.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.406
It's all in his throat.

16:09.933 --> 16:10.922
Young man.

16:11.373 --> 16:14.206
<i>Did you see
Throw Momma From The Train?</i>

16:25.373 --> 16:28.445
I can't stand it.
Scott is making me sick.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.207
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

16:34.533 --> 16:37.969
My... My uncle's got her
on this crazy curfew thing, man.

16:42.053 --> 16:43.566
Hilary, listen, I am begging you.

16:43.773 --> 16:45.809
Please go back in there
and apologize to him.

16:45.973 --> 16:48.441
It's very sweet of you
to worry about me, Will.

16:48.613 --> 16:51.764
- But I'm gonna be just fine.
- Wait, Hilary, listen.

16:52.893 --> 16:56.442
Look, if you leave now,
I might get kicked out of school.

16:56.813 --> 16:57.802
What?

16:58.733 --> 17:02.203
Well, see, Professor Burton
broke up with his wife...

17:02.373 --> 17:04.647
...and, you know,
he was grading really difficult.

17:04.813 --> 17:07.202
So I figured if he was happier,
then just maybe...

17:07.413 --> 17:09.973
So you've just been using me
to get a good grade?

17:10.173 --> 17:14.290
No, not at all. A little.

17:15.413 --> 17:18.848
- Oh, God.
- Wait. Hilary. Hil...

17:20.373 --> 17:22.045
Hey, look, Pavarotti, go in there...

17:22.213 --> 17:24.363
...and tell my date
I'll be back in a minute.

17:25.973 --> 17:27.326
Ladies and gentlemen:

17:27.492 --> 17:29.961
Le Crib Chalet.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.209
Honey.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.732
I owe you an apology, honey.

17:37.893 --> 17:42.171
Not only did you do a great job,
but you did it together with Carlton.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.812
Mom, do me a favor.

17:43.973 --> 17:45.964
Don't have anymore babies.

17:47.053 --> 17:51.490
<i>Hey, Dad. Did you see this report
in Consumer magazine?</i>

17:51.693 --> 17:55.572
It says that the Crib Chalet is
the most dangerous crib on the market.

17:55.733 --> 17:57.052
What are you talking about?

17:57.213 --> 17:59.329
According to this,
the crib malfunctioned...

17:59.493 --> 18:03.372
...and an infant
was tossed 50 feet in the air.

18:04.173 --> 18:06.767
We can beat that.

18:07.973 --> 18:09.247
Geoffrey.

18:09.413 --> 18:11.529
Well... Well, that was just one crib.

18:11.693 --> 18:14.161
Well, the same thing happened
to twins in Nova Scotia.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.609
<i>Sweetheart, why don't you go read
an Archie comic book or something.</i>

18:17.773 --> 18:21.527
Philip, the important thing is that you
and your son spent quality time together.

18:21.693 --> 18:23.649
You should be proud
of what you built.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.765
Even if it is a deathtrap.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.251
You are just jealous because
you don't have son like Carlton...

18:30.453 --> 18:31.886
...to build something with.

18:32.093 --> 18:35.563
Yes, sir, that must be it.

18:40.333 --> 18:44.372
Look: It's a bird. It's a plane.

18:44.533 --> 18:47.525
It's Master Nicky.

18:58.973 --> 19:00.691
Hilary.

19:01.493 --> 19:05.611
Tonight, I hurt somebody
that I really care about.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.681
What about me, Will?

19:11.413 --> 19:13.802
I meant you.

19:15.573 --> 19:17.370
Thank you.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.485
- But you were right.
- I was?

19:20.653 --> 19:24.123
Scott is the first guy since Trevor
that I really liked...

19:24.293 --> 19:27.524
...and I guess I got scared and I had
to find something wrong with him.

19:28.493 --> 19:31.883
And that Adam's-apple thing
was the best you could do, huh?

19:32.093 --> 19:34.163
Well, I never had much
of an imagination.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.291
When I was a little girl,
I never had any imaginary friends.

19:37.453 --> 19:40.092
I just used to play with Carlton's.

19:45.013 --> 19:47.447
And, God, they were such dweebs.

19:53.253 --> 19:55.892
You really miss Trevor, don't you?

19:56.053 --> 19:58.692
I know it sounds dumb...

19:59.173 --> 20:02.404
...but sometimes I feel like
we're still engaged.

20:02.773 --> 20:06.766
I mean, he died so suddenly and
I never had a chance to say goodbye.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.487
Well, it's never too late.

20:14.493 --> 20:18.327
I gotta go study
for the massacre at little big mole.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.725
Look, Hil, I'm sorry, all right?

20:24.853 --> 20:26.286
Good night.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.285
Good night, Will.

20:46.973 --> 20:49.009
Goodbye, Trevor.

21:01.653 --> 21:04.690
<i>Will Smith studied all night
and passed his English midterm.</i>

21:04.853 --> 21:08.846
<i>One week later,
he was taken off academic probation.</i>

21:09.253 --> 21:12.370
<i>Two weeks later, he was put back on.</i>

21:17.733 --> 21:21.328
<i>Professor Scott Burton
began dating Rhetta.</i>

21:23.413 --> 21:28.123
<i>Shortly after, her parents demanded
he be removed from the college.</i>

21:30.133 --> 21:33.091
<i>Hilary Banks is currently dating.</i>

21:33.373 --> 21:35.648
<i>She remembers nothing.</i>

21:39.773 --> 21:43.846
<i>Baby Nicky only made it to 42 feet.</i>

21:49.533 --> 21:52.650
And then, just for no reason,
you'll say:

22:03.293 --> 22:06.330
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:09.893 --> 22:13.932
That is insane.
I don't know what he's gonna say.
