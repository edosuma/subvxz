MY DAD TOOK ME TO
CIRCUS OF VALUES LAST NIGHT

BEAT UP TODAY?

02:45.580 --> 02:47.750

WILL MILHOUSE AND I BE FRIENDS

WHAT COULD COME BETWEEN
TWO BESTEST BUDDIES LIKE US?

03:16.010 --> 03:19.280
SAMANTHA, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN SUSPICIOUS

03:19.340 --> 03:21.540
OF TRANSFER STUDENTS.

03:21.610 --> 03:24.640
OTHER PRINCIPALS TRY TO UNLOAD
PROBLEM CASES THAT WAY.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.720
LORD KNOWS I DO.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.290
I'M A GOOD STUDENT.

03:28.350 --> 03:30.520
YEAH, SURE, AND THEY TOLD ME
I'D GET A BIG PARADE

03:30.590 --> 03:31.490
WHEN I GOT BACK FROM 'NAM.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.060
INSTEAD, THEY SPAT ON ME.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.100
I CAN STILL FEEL IT SEARING.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.470
SO, LET'S JUST SEE

03:37.530 --> 03:39.600
WHAT THE PERMANENT RECORD
HAS TO SAY, SHALL WE?

03:39.670 --> 03:43.370

<i>THAT'S IN THERE?</i>

03:47.510 --> 03:49.080
DON'T WORRY.
THEY'LL FORGET...

03:49.140 --> 03:51.650
JUST LIKE THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME

03:51.710 --> 03:55.080
IN THAT TIGER CAGE
FOR 18 AGONIZING MONTHS.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.890
EVERY NIGHT I WAKE UP SCREAMING.

03:57.950 --> 04:00.290
WELL, LET'S MEET
YOUR CLASSMATES.

04:02.750 --> 04:05.280
HEY, BART, WAS THIS THING
RIGHT ABOUT YOUR TEST?

04:05.360 --> 04:07.460
TO THOSE WHO DOUBT THE POWER
OF THE MAGIC EIGHT BALL

04:07.530 --> 04:11.430
I SAY, BEHOLD MY "F."

04:11.500 --> 04:12.600
ATTENTION, CLASS.

04:12.660 --> 04:14.790
I HAVE A NEW STUDENT FOR YOU.

04:14.870 --> 04:17.810
GREAT, ANOTHER STUDENT.
JUST KEEP PACKING THEM
IN, SEYMOUR.

04:17.870 --> 04:19.910
I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS
THIS LATER, EDNA.

04:19.970 --> 04:22.410
NOW, IT'S NEVER EASY
TO COME TO A NEW SCHOOL,

04:22.470 --> 04:24.340
SO LET'S MAKE HER FEEL
RIGHT AT HOME.

04:24.410 --> 04:26.910
PLEASE SAY A BIG

STANKY.

04:32.180 --> 04:33.180
OH, RIGHT.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.020
HOW EMBARRASSING FOR YOU.

04:35.090 --> 04:36.390
WELL, GOOD-BYE.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.230
I'M SURE THIS IS
A LITTLE SCARY FOR YOU, DEAR.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.130
- UH-HUH.
- SO, WHY DON'T YOU STAND UP
IN FRONT OF THE CLASS

04:41.190 --> 04:42.790
AND TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF?

04:42.860 --> 04:44.270
I'LL BE GRADING YOU

04:44.330 --> 04:45.600
ON GRAMMAR AND POISE.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.890
WE JUST MOVED HERE FROM PHOENIX.

04:47.970 --> 04:49.900
MY DAD'S OWNS
A HOME SECURITY COMPANY.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.470
HE CAME TO SPRINGFIELD
BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH CRIME RATE

04:52.540 --> 04:54.340
AND LACKLUSTER POLICE FORCE.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.480
ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE BACK IN PHOENIX

04:56.540 --> 05:00.420
AND THIS TOWN HAS A WEIRD SMELL
THAT YOU'RE ALL PROBABLY USED TO

05:00.480 --> 05:01.620
BUT I'M NOT.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.250
IT'LL TAKE YOU ABOUT SIX WEEKS,
DEAR.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.050
HEY, MILHOUSE, WOULD YOU
LIKE A WET WILLIE?

05:06.120 --> 05:07.190
SURE.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.620
EWW!

05:09.690 --> 05:10.560
( <i>laughing )</i>

05:10.620 --> 05:12.020
VICTIM NUMBER FOUR.

05:12.090 --> 05:14.960
HEY, LOUIS, CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN A WET WILLIE?

05:15.030 --> 05:17.570
Louis:
SURE... AAH!

05:19.670 --> 05:22.940
WHEN I FIND OUT WHO
HIT ME WITH THAT BALL

05:23.000 --> 05:26.040
I'M GOING TO TEAR THEM A NEW...!

05:27.670 --> 05:28.970

WHY YOUR HORMONES

05:31.440 --> 05:33.540

AN EASY TARGET

05:35.710 --> 05:37.480

A SHORT SEX EDUCATION FILM.

05:40.350 --> 05:41.590
EZEKIEL AND ISHMAEL

05:41.650 --> 05:44.050
IN ACCORDANCE WITH
YOUR PARENTS' WISHES

05:44.120 --> 05:45.880
YOU MAY STEP OUT
INTO THE HALL

05:45.960 --> 05:48.200
AND PRAY FOR OUR SOULS.

05:49.630 --> 05:51.800
Hello. I'm actor Troy McClure.

05:51.860 --> 05:55.460
You kids might remember me
from such educational films

05:55.530 --> 05:57.960
as <i>Lead Paint:
Delicious But Deadly</i>

05:58.040 --> 06:00.010
and <i>Here Comes
The Metric System.</i>

06:00.070 --> 06:02.540
I'm here to provide
the facts about sex

06:02.610 --> 06:04.980
in a frank
and straightforward manner.

06:05.040 --> 06:05.840
<i>And now, here's...</i>

06:09.150 --> 06:10.620
<i>This is Fuzzy Bunny.</i>

06:10.680 --> 06:12.080
<i>About a year ago</i>

06:12.150 --> 06:14.490
<i>he noticed
his voice was changing</i>

06:14.550 --> 06:16.480
<i>he had terrible acne</i>

06:16.560 --> 06:19.560
<i>and had fur
where there was no fur before.</i>

06:19.630 --> 06:22.130
<i>He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.</i>

06:22.190 --> 06:23.620
BORING.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.200
( <i>bland, Muzak-style
background music )</i>

06:26.260 --> 06:27.660
<i>Fluffy and Fuzzy</i>

06:27.730 --> 06:29.260
<i>went to the park</i>

06:29.330 --> 06:30.660
<i>the ice cream social</i>

06:30.740 --> 06:32.070
<i>the boat show</i>

06:32.140 --> 06:34.310
<i>and various other
wholesome activities</i>

06:34.370 --> 06:36.430
<i>and they never ruined their fun</i>

06:36.510 --> 06:39.810
<i>by giving in to their throbbing
biological urges.</i>

06:39.880 --> 06:41.380
<i>Then came the big day.</i>

06:41.450 --> 06:44.320
<i>Fluffy and Fuzzy got married.</i>

06:44.380 --> 06:47.010
<i>That night came the honeymoon.</i>

06:47.090 --> 06:49.690
( <i>funky, sexy jazz playing )</i>

06:49.760 --> 06:51.290
All:
EWW!

06:51.360 --> 06:52.990
SHE'S FAKING IT.

06:53.060 --> 06:56.730
<i>The most satisfying part
was knowing that they waited.</i>

06:56.800 --> 06:58.200
<i>Nine months later</i>

06:58.260 --> 07:01.260
<i>Fluffy gave birth
to 14 beautiful bunnies.</i>

07:01.330 --> 07:02.660
<i>Eight survive.</i>

07:02.730 --> 07:04.960
And now that you know
how it's done...

07:05.040 --> 07:07.340
don't do it.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.740
( <i>funky, sexy jazz )</i>

07:08.810 --> 07:10.040
ANY QUESTIONS?

07:10.110 --> 07:11.310
MRS. KRABAPPEL

07:11.380 --> 07:14.220
HOW COME YOU DON'T LIVE
WITH MR. KRABAPPEL?

07:14.280 --> 07:15.780
BECAUSE MR. KRABAPPEL

07:15.850 --> 07:18.550
CHASED SOMETHING SMALL
AND FLUFFY DOWN A RABBIT HOLE.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.690
HOW DO WE KNOW
WHEN WE FALL IN LOVE?

07:20.750 --> 07:22.110
OH, DON'T YOU WORRY.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.490
MOST OF YOU
WILL NEVER FALL IN LOVE

07:24.560 --> 07:27.200
AND MARRY OUT OF FEAR
OF DYING ALONE.

07:27.260 --> 07:30.730
HOW WOULD I GO ABOUT CREATING
HALF MAN, HALF MONKEY-TYPE
CREATURE?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.870
I'M SORRY,
THAT WOULD BE PLAYING GOD.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.240
GOD, SHMOD--
I WANT MY MONKEY MAN.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.040
( <i>bell ringing )</i>

07:37.100 --> 07:39.910
UH... THAT'S A NICE DRESS.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.280
MY DAD MAKES ME WEAR IT.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.280
I HATE IT.

07:42.340 --> 07:43.910
I HATE IT TOO.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.450
- UH... CAN I WALK YOU HOME?
- OKAY.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.510
EVERYBODY ON.

07:48.580 --> 07:49.580
NO SHOVING.

07:49.650 --> 07:50.650
JUST KIDDING.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.590
YOU CAN SHOVE ALL YOU WANT.

07:52.650 --> 07:54.620
HEY, WAIT, OTTO MAN,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

07:54.690 --> 07:56.220
MILHOUSE ISN'T HERE YET.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.690
SORRY, BART DUDE,
NO TIME.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.560
MY GIRLFRIEND'S DANCING TOPLESS
AT THE AIRPORT BAR

08:01.630 --> 08:03.130
FROM 4:15 TO 4:20.

08:06.330 --> 08:08.170
HEY, BART.

08:08.230 --> 08:11.330
MILHOUSE, WHAT
A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.660
HI.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.280
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE SKIRT?

08:14.340 --> 08:16.880
I'VE BROUGHT FRIENDS
TO THIS TREE HOUSE BEFORE.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.280
YEAH, BUT NEVER A GIRL.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.270
WHAT IF I WANT
TO STRUT AROUND NUDE?

08:20.350 --> 08:21.950
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

08:22.010 --> 08:23.710
NO, THAT'S OKAY,
YOU CAN STAY.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.820
YOU CAN READ COMICS WITH US.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.780
LET'S SEE,
SOMETHING FOR THE LADY...

08:28.850 --> 08:32.580
AH-- <i>RADIOACTIVE MAN

08:41.070 --> 08:44.270
NO, BUT MY SISTER'S
GOT A WIDE SELECTION

08:44.340 --> 08:45.840
OF CRAPPY COMICS.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.380
EWW!

08:50.440 --> 08:52.610
YOU GUYS WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING GROSS?

<i>Here's your host,
Kent Brockman.</i>

09:08.160 --> 09:09.900
Good evening.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.930
Did you know that 34 million
American adults are obese?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.440
Taken together
that excess blubber

09:14.500 --> 09:16.740
could fill the Grand Canyon
two-fifths of the way up.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.870
That may not sound impressive

09:18.940 --> 09:21.640
but keep in mind,
it is a <i>very big canyon.</i>

09:21.710 --> 09:24.480
THIS SUCKS. WHERE'S
THAT CHANNEL CHANGER?

09:24.540 --> 09:26.900
( <i>grunting )</i>

09:26.980 --> 09:28.080
OH.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.580
I'LL GIVE IT A CHANCE.

09:29.650 --> 09:31.090
Americans have grown up

09:31.150 --> 09:33.120
with the image
of the jolly fat man--

09:33.190 --> 09:34.420
<i>Dom DeLuise</i>

09:34.490 --> 09:36.290
Alfred Hitchcock, and, of course

09:36.350 --> 09:37.680
<i>Santa Claus.</i>

09:37.760 --> 09:39.090
<i>But in real life</i>

09:39.160 --> 09:42.230
<i>Santa would be suffering
from gall stones</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:45.320
<i>hypertension, impotence,
and diabetes.</i>

09:58.780 --> 10:02.750
I WISH THEY HAD NEVER
INVENTED FRIED CHEESE.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.210
WE GOT TO WIDEN
THE HOLE.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.880
MAKE IT SNAPPY--
THE CHAIN'S STARTING TO GIVE.

10:08.950 --> 10:10.050

<i>We take 18 ounces
of sizzling ground beef

10:19.300 --> 10:22.170

ham, and a fried egg.</i>

<i>We call it

10:31.540 --> 10:33.370
I'VE GOT TO HELP HIM.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.320
OKAY, MILHOUSE

10:36.380 --> 10:39.650
I'LL TRADE YOUR CARL YASTRZEMSKI
BASEBALL CARD

10:39.720 --> 10:42.390

DEAL.

10:42.450 --> 10:44.650
NEXT ON THE TRADING BLOCK,
YOUR MICKEY MANTLE, 1958

10:44.720 --> 10:47.620
FOR MY PICTURE
OF HOMER ON THE COUCH.

10:48.830 --> 10:50.560
MILHOUSE, I'VE GOT TO GO.

10:50.630 --> 10:53.570
MY DAD THINKS I'M HAVING
MY BRACES EXAMINED.

10:53.630 --> 10:57.040
WELL, YOU KIND OF
SORT OF ARE.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.610
MILHOUSE, WE'RE LIVING
IN THE AGE OF COOTIES.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.210
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE RISK YOU'RE RUNNING.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.780
BESIDES, WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT KISSING?

11:09.850 --> 11:11.650

20:44.320 --> 20:45.660
IN THE PENGUIN HOUSE.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.020
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BART.

20:47.090 --> 20:48.600
I LOVE SAINT SEBASTIAN'S.

20:48.660 --> 20:51.400
IT'S RUN BY A GROUP
OF FRENCH CANADIAN NUNS.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.420
THEY'RE VERY NICE

20:52.500 --> 20:54.430
EXCEPT THEY NEVER LET ME OUT.

20:54.500 --> 21:01.110
( <i>singing "Dominique"
in French )</i>

21:01.170 --> 21:03.840
SAMANTHA, <i>NE PAS DES BOYS.</i>

21:03.910 --> 21:06.150
( <i>ringing )</i>

21:07.750 --> 21:09.650
I HAVE TO GO NOW,
MILHOUSE.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.650
I'D BETTER NOT.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.720
IT'S 50 ROSARIES
A KISS.

21:14.790 --> 21:16.220
OH, OKAY.

21:16.290 --> 21:17.660
OH, WHAT THE HECK.

21:21.390 --> 21:22.590
BART

21:22.660 --> 21:25.430
THINK I CAN EVER FIND
ANOTHER ONE LIKE HER?

21:25.500 --> 21:27.930
YOU'RE ASKING
THE WRONG GUY, MILHOUSE.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.240
THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE TO ME.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.570
NOW, LET'S GO WHIP DONUTS
AT OLD PEOPLE.
