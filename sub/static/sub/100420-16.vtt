Look, nothing's easy.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.158
But I wouldn't be talking to you now

02:38.241 --> 02:40.743
if I didn't believe
that it wasn't too late for us.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.079
So what are we doing here?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.373
I don't know about the rest of you,

02:45.456 --> 02:49.460
but I'm here to put on the best
goddamn production of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>

02:49.544 --> 02:52.589
this supermax prison has ever seen!

02:52.839 --> 02:55.341
So let's take it back
to Mrs. Elvsted's entrance,

02:55.425 --> 02:59.387
and remember, if you're on stage,
I can see you, you're in character,

02:59.470 --> 03:02.098
you have an opinion
about the return of Ejlert Løvborg.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.893
-Oh, shit, is it 10:30 already?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.269
Okay, look, guys, I gotta go,

03:06.352 --> 03:08.479
but I'll be back tomorrow
and we'll pick up rehearsals Monday.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.065
If everyone could be off-book by then,
that would be phenomenal.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.151
Schlesinger,
if you have time to fashion a shiv

03:13.234 --> 03:15.153
and organize a jump on the rats
in Block C,

03:15.236 --> 03:17.030
you have time to learn your lines, 'kay?

03:17.113 --> 03:18.990
-Priorities.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.458
-There he is!

03:28.541 --> 03:31.544
Uh-oh! America's most wanted
over here, huh?

03:31.628 --> 03:34.631
-Thanks for picking me up.
-The jury finds you guilty

03:34.714 --> 03:37.175
of being a super-cool dude, am I right?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.718
You're extremely clever, can we go?

03:38.801 --> 03:43.139
I sentence you to life...
filled with my friendship!

03:43.514 --> 03:45.767
If this is my only other option,
I choose prison.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.147
So you were just planning
on wearing this to the wedding?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.108
Really leaning on that "optional"
in black tie optional.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.401
These are the clothes I went in with.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.487
I didn't know
I'd be going to a wedding in a year.

03:57.570 --> 04:01.574
That's why you always gotta pack
a spare suit, just in case.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.786
-What are you in for again?
-Officially, breaking and entering,

04:04.869 --> 04:06.788
but I think it was kind of for everything.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.706
Ah, a little bit of everything.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.209
Like the varied cuisine
at your favorite small plate

04:11.292 --> 04:13.461
lazy Susan restaurant, right?

04:13.544 --> 04:15.505
-Pardon?
-Do you have a favorite

04:15.588 --> 04:17.423
establishment of that sort?

04:17.507 --> 04:21.135
A favorite small plate
lazy Susan restaurant? Hell if I know.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.721
BoJack, it means so much
that you would say that.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.140
I actually am a little hungry.
Where could we get lunch around here?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.308
Elefino!

04:27.392 --> 04:29.644
No? Oh, how about the diner?

04:35.858 --> 04:39.362
So, do you spend a lot of time
with them, as a couple?

04:39.529 --> 04:42.448
Well, I see Princess Carolyn a lot
at "Birthday Dad" events.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.285
Emmys, Golden Globes,
Critic's Choice Awards, Peabody Awards.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.037
The Nobel Prize for Television
they created just for our show.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.956
But Judah usually stays home with Ruthie.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.875
-I can't believe she's getting married.
-Thought it would be with you, huh?

04:52.959 --> 04:56.087
I thought it would be with nobody
because I wasted all her best years.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.588
Turns out her best years are now.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.466
Well, joke's on me.
I couldn't even waste the right years.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.218
I'm shocked she could get me out
for the weekend.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.512
-When are you getting out for real?
-Few months.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.849
Wow. What are you gonna do next?
Big plans post-big house?

05:07.932 --> 05:09.309
<i>Big Momma's House</i> reboot?

05:09.392 --> 05:11.894
Reboot of the franchise
<i>Big Momma's House, </i>starring you?

05:11.978 --> 05:15.148
My main goal right now
is just not screwing up this weekend.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.607
You won't screw it up.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.609
I'm sure I'll find a way.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.528
-Mm.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.032
Can you get me another suit?

05:26.117 --> 05:27.327
You think Diane's gonna be there?

05:27.410 --> 05:30.204
Everyone's going to be there.
It's the party of the year.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.540
I haven't talked to Diane since, uh...

05:32.790 --> 05:35.626
-What about you? Are you seeing anyone?
-Oh, I'm too busy with my show.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.545
Those birthdays
aren't gonna dad themselves!

05:37.628 --> 05:38.880
What is this show?

05:38.963 --> 05:41.924
Besides, I'm really trying to focus
on myself right now.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.468
I had this breakthrough recently.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.470
One day, in therapy, I just blurted out,

05:45.553 --> 05:48.681
"Is my problem with women
any movie directed by Christopher Nolan?

05:48.765 --> 05:53.394
Because, yes, women are involved,
but it's really never about the women.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.479
It's about me."

05:54.562 --> 05:56.814
-That's actually somewhat astute.
-It occurred to me:

05:56.898 --> 06:00.360
Are my self-destructive patterns
and unexamined cycles of co-dependency

06:00.443 --> 06:02.528
the popular Jim Carrey character The Mask?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.113
Because "somebody stop me"!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.240
Are all of your breakthroughs
phrased like that?

06:06.324 --> 06:09.619
Um, are all of my breakthroughs a British
prog-rock band from the '70s?

06:09.702 --> 06:11.996
-Because yes.
-Ugh!

06:13.498 --> 06:15.750
W-What are we doing here?
Is this where the wedding is?

06:15.833 --> 06:18.795
-I just have to make a real quick stop.
-At the Griffith Observatory?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.922
-I have a press event.
-You took me to a press event?

06:21.005 --> 06:23.007
It was on the way.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.760
Ah! No. What do you... I can't be here.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.388
-It'll take 15 minutes, 20 tops.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.556
Definitely not more
than two and a half hours.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.685
Hello, everybody!

06:34.769 --> 06:38.314
You all know and love me
as the titular Birthday Dad.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.026
I've also been known for other roles:
Sad Dog, fracking advocate,

06:42.110 --> 06:44.821
finder-outer of what
Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

06:44.904 --> 06:46.030
and whether they know things,

06:46.114 --> 06:50.618
but some of you might remember me
as the notorious Stealer of the "D"!

06:50.701 --> 06:51.536
Ooh!

06:51.619 --> 06:54.539
Now, to celebrate the success
of "Birthday Dad,"

06:54.622 --> 06:57.875
I thought it was time
I gave a birthday present back!

06:57.959 --> 07:00.211
I called up my favorite sign company
and said,

07:00.294 --> 07:02.588
"I wanna give this whole town the 'D'!

07:02.672 --> 07:03.840
'D' for Dad.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.550
'Birthday Dad,' that is!"

07:05.633 --> 07:06.509
Yay!

07:06.592 --> 07:09.178
So, without further a-dad,

07:09.262 --> 07:12.932
let's say goodbye
to the era of Hollywoo forever,

07:13.015 --> 07:15.309
and say hello to...

07:15.685 --> 07:19.021
-Holly... woob?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.189
Huh?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.817
No, I said "D" as in "Birthday Dad."

07:23.443 --> 07:25.653
No, obviously I meant the "Dad" part
of "Birthday Dad,"

07:25.736 --> 07:27.405
I assumed that went without saying.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.866
Look, I gotta go,
but the next time I need a sign made

07:29.949 --> 07:33.119
I'm going to strongly consider
going with a different company.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.705
Okay, next stop: wedding!

07:35.788 --> 07:37.874
I'm not ready for this.
You gotta take me back to jail.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.418
What? Come on, Shawshank,
you're gonna be fine.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.337
No, I can't be around people.
I can't face them, I'm not ready.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.840
-What do you think is gonna happen?
-I don't know! I never know.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.925
I just know that something bad
is gonna happen

07:48.009 --> 07:49.010
if I go to that wedding.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.803
How about this? We'll go to the wedding

07:50.887 --> 07:53.473
and if you get there
and you wanna leave, we can leave.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.640
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.642
And if you wanna stay,
I'll stay there with you.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.935
I will not leave your side.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.353
-You sure?
-Of course.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.397
I'm here for you, buddy. No matter what.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.024
Unless I see my good friend Erica

08:03.107 --> 08:05.318
and get distracted
by some noteworthy aspect

08:05.401 --> 08:06.652
of her character or presentation,

08:06.736 --> 08:10.406
but, BoJack,
what are the odds that would...

08:11.532 --> 08:14.744
<i>-♪ No more lonely nights ♪</i>
-Ugh.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.206
<i>♪ Wishes do come true ♪</i>

08:19.457 --> 08:20.374
Hmm.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.460
Huh.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.005
-BoJack! Thank God I found you!
- What? What is it?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.382
The fireworks are going to start
in ten minutes.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.884
There's no time to explain.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.887
We need to go down to the beach
so I can sit on your shoulders!

08:32.970 --> 08:36.390
-What? Why?
-I just said there's no time to explain!

08:36.474 --> 08:39.101
Did you go to jail
for being a bad listener?

08:39.185 --> 08:41.521
-Come on, we gotta go!
- Okay.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.566
- Whoa! Ho-oh!

08:45.650 --> 08:49.529
Oh, wow! That's like a 3-D one!

08:49.820 --> 08:50.988
So...

08:51.072 --> 08:52.573
why did we need to be on the beach?

08:52.657 --> 08:55.117
Oh, you just seemed
really overwhelmed at the party.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.204
-I thought you could use some air.
-Oh. Thanks.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.331
But then why are you on my shoulders?

09:00.414 --> 09:02.458
So I could get
a better view of the fireworks.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.128
-Okay, get down. Oh, okay.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.380
It's good to see you.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.173
How'd you get out of the supermax?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.676
Did a helicopter crash
into the side of the building

09:11.759 --> 09:13.094
and then you just walked out?

09:13.177 --> 09:16.180
What? No. I'm just here for the wedding.
I'm going back tomorrow.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.515
Oh, bummer.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.434
No, it's good.
I think the routine is good for me.

09:20.518 --> 09:25.439
-I'm staying out of trouble, at least.
-Hooray! Staying out of trouble, at least!

09:25.523 --> 09:27.441
I'm trying to set little goals for myself.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.486
Like, in a couple months,
I'll beat my record for being sober.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.196
-Nice!
-Yeah, so that's...

09:32.280 --> 09:36.576
that's something to aim for,
but then, uh, after that, um...

09:36.659 --> 09:39.078
After that, you'll beat your record again.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.122
Every day, you'll set a new record.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.708
Sure. But it's easy now. In jail.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.876
I don't have to
make any choices for myself.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.170
I worry about what's gonna happen
when I get out.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.132
-What if I relapse again?
-Then you'll get sober again.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.342
-Let me tell you something.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.760
I was at the office the other day,

09:54.844 --> 09:57.263
doing the "Hokey Pokey"
with some work associates...

09:57.346 --> 09:58.848
-Uh-huh.
-...and I realized

09:58.931 --> 10:00.891
everyone misunderstands that song.

10:00.975 --> 10:01.934
"The Hokey Pokey"?

10:02.018 --> 10:05.646
Yeah, there's way too much emphasis
on the "hokey pokey" part.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.523
That is what it's all about.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.108
No. That's exactly what I mean.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.235
-That's not what the song is saying.
-Okay.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.698
And I was thinking about my mom,
you know, my relationship with my mom.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.367
It's weird. You know, awkward.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.371
I feel like she doesn't really get me,
but, you know, she's trying.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.372
And a couple years ago,

10:23.456 --> 10:27.251
I never thought I would have
any kind of relationship with her.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.419
Like, I was sure of it.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.378
What changed?

10:29.462 --> 10:33.215
I don't know. I did? Or-- Or she did?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.594
Or, um, we... are?

10:36.677 --> 10:39.513
-Huh.
-So, that's what I'm talking about.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.015
It's like the song says.

10:41.098 --> 10:44.644
"You do the hokey pokey
and you turn yourself around."

10:44.727 --> 10:48.939
You turn yourself around.
That's what it's all about.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.901
Yeah, I don't know if the songwriters
put that much thought

10:51.984 --> 10:54.153
into the existential significance
of the lyrics.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.322
They literally rhyme "about" with "about."

10:56.405 --> 10:58.949
But isn't the point of art
less what people put into it

10:59.033 --> 11:01.702
and more what people get out of it?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.829
-Is that the point of art?
-Maybe.

11:03.913 --> 11:08.334
Or maybe art doesn't need a point.
Maybe that's why it's called art.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.878
I can't tell
if you're being smart or stupid.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.338
Oh, I never know.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.924
I think you had it for a moment
and then you lost it.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.470
Oh, well!
It was nice while it lasted, right?

11:20.304 --> 11:23.641
Sure. It was nice while it lasted.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.108
Ugh!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.195
Huh! Not bad.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.155
Hey, there he is!

11:38.239 --> 11:40.324
Oh, my God,
that was an incredible wedding.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.659
Yeah? It wasn't too much

11:41.742 --> 11:43.744
with the fireworks,
and the cirque performers,

11:43.828 --> 11:45.621
and the procession of exotic peafowl?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.832
No, you produced the hell out of it.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.418
What'd you think about the part
where the priest got murdered

11:50.501 --> 11:53.587
and Judah had to figure out
which bridesmaid was the culprit?

11:53.671 --> 11:55.589
A little outside the box,
as far as weddings go,

11:55.673 --> 11:56.882
but it worked in context.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.426
I thought so, too!

11:58.509 --> 12:01.762
Congratulations.
And Judah, too. Where is he?

12:01.846 --> 12:04.598
I think he's going over some contracts.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.434
We're putting together
an all-female reboot

12:06.517 --> 12:07.685
of <i>12 Angry Men.</i>

12:07.768 --> 12:10.855
It's called "11 Angry Women."

12:10.938 --> 12:13.524
-Not 12?
-You gotta leave room for a sequel.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.986
So your groom is doing paperwork
during his own wedding reception?

12:17.069 --> 12:20.906
Oh, we had our real wedding a week ago.
This one's just for the industry.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.159
-What?
-I invited the town's top talent,

12:23.242 --> 12:25.619
took away their phones,
and shuffled them together.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.163
Give 'em some booze, get 'em chatty,

12:27.246 --> 12:28.831
next day, they're calling me,

12:28.914 --> 12:30.791
"Hey, could you put me in touch
with so-and-so?"

12:30.875 --> 12:33.878
-Boom! I've attached myself as a producer!
-Does that really work?

12:33.961 --> 12:38.215
Hey, Jennifer Jason Leigh!
Have you met regular Jason Lee?

12:38.299 --> 12:41.719
You're my two favorite Jason Lees.
Discuss.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.555
Well, I am offended I wasn't
important enough for your real wedding,

12:44.638 --> 12:47.641
but I'm flattered I'm important enough
for your industry one.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.728
Are you kidding?
"Horny Unicorn" is tracking huge.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.229
-What?
-All of Hollywoob

12:52.313 --> 12:53.814
is buzzing about your comeback.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.025
No. Did you say "Hollywoob"?

12:56.108 --> 12:58.068
If this movie does what it's supposed to,

12:58.152 --> 13:01.822
the district attorney's not the only one
who's gonna wanna lock you into something.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.824
I'm not sure
I should take on more projects.

13:03.908 --> 13:07.203
I started this drama program at prison
and we're doing <i>Hedda Gabler.</i>

13:07.286 --> 13:10.164
I mean, it's not Strindberg,
but, you know, we're having a good time.

13:10.247 --> 13:13.083
I thought that maybe when I got out,
I could go back and volunteer.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.835
Oh! Well, that sounds fabulous!

13:14.919 --> 13:17.838
Yeah, but...  I didn't even
think that I'd have other options.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.799
A year ago,
everyone in this town hated me.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.217
People have short memories.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.719
It's the best and worst thing
about people.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.930
Well, maybe there's a way I could do both?

13:26.013 --> 13:27.765
-I've really enjoyed teaching.
-Oh! Oh.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.141
Maybe I could direct something?

13:29.225 --> 13:31.477
-I'm sorry I said anything. I--
-Well, I mean, hold on.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.479
Yeah, I shouldn't
just jump into something,

13:33.562 --> 13:36.774
but if there's a good opportunity,
I'd be stupid not to take it, right?

13:36.857 --> 13:39.235
I mean, we both know how hard it is
to get heat in this town.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.612
Think it over.
I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.823
Well, a decision.

13:47.284 --> 13:50.579
-Hey, you wanna dance?
-Yeah.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.252
-What?
-Oh! Aw.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.423
You know, I had this weird idea
when I heard you were getting married

14:01.507 --> 14:04.760
that I'd get here
and there'd be some disaster,

14:04.844 --> 14:08.639
and I knew that either I would cause it
or, just maybe,

14:08.722 --> 14:10.516
I would be the only one who could fix it.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.725
A disaster, huh?

14:11.809 --> 14:15.354
Not like a "disaster" disaster,
like a sitcom disaster, you know?

14:15.437 --> 14:18.274
Like, it would be time for the wedding
and no one would know where to find you.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.276
-No one but you, right?
-Yeah.

14:20.359 --> 14:24.989
And I'd find you in some special spot
and I'd say, "Come on, it's time to go."

14:25.072 --> 14:27.491
And you'd say,
"What am I doing, BoJack?"

14:27.575 --> 14:30.578
And then what,
I'd run off with you?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.621
No, I would talk you
into going through with it,

14:32.705 --> 14:35.708
and it would be like a symbol
of how much I'd grown,

14:35.791 --> 14:37.418
that I could let you go.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.295
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.713
No, I mean, I'm happy for you.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.257
Just... it's a better story
if you had cold feet.

14:43.340 --> 14:47.011
It's a better story for you.
I think I like it better this way.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.679
I guess you're right.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.056
What would you have said to me?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.934
Oh, I don't know. I would have said, uh,

14:54.018 --> 14:57.521
-"Come on, man. Do it."
- Oh, wow.

14:57.605 --> 15:01.066
No, no, no. I would-- Okay. Hold on.
Tell me what you're afraid of.

15:01.150 --> 15:05.029
In this make-believe scenario
that you came up with?

15:05.112 --> 15:06.822
-Yeah.
-Okay.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.534
Well, I guess I'm afraid
of losing some part of myself.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.079
I'm afraid that if I let someone else
take care of me

15:14.163 --> 15:15.956
that I'm not really me anymore.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.418
I'm afraid of getting too comfortable,
you know, going soft.

15:19.501 --> 15:23.464
I'm afraid that this could be
the best thing that ever happened to me

15:23.547 --> 15:27.009
and if it doesn't make me
as happy as I'm supposed to be,

15:27.092 --> 15:29.762
that means I'm a lost cause.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.472
-Holy shit.
-What?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.807
I don't know,
those are some really good arguments.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.893
-Are you kidding me?!
-Okay, okay, look.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.312
Yes, all those things could be true,
but on the other hand,

15:38.395 --> 15:41.148
what if you deserve to be happy

15:41.231 --> 15:43.817
and this is a thing
that will make you happy?

15:43.901 --> 15:47.196
And maybe don't worry
about whether you'll be happy later

15:47.279 --> 15:49.949
and just focus
on how you're happy right now?

15:50.032 --> 15:52.242
-Oh, is it that easy?
-No.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.036
But you're here because, at some point,

15:54.119 --> 15:56.747
Princess Carolyn thought
this was a good idea.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.249
And I think we oughta listen to her.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.669
Because she's the smartest woman I know.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.754
That's true. She is.

16:03.837 --> 16:06.465
So, what do you think?
Are you gonna marry him?

16:06.548 --> 16:10.135
Well, I already got the dress.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.138
But you didn't need me
to say any of that, did you?

16:13.222 --> 16:14.682
I guess I didn't.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.851
Hey, if I do decide
to get back into the business

16:17.935 --> 16:19.228
when I get out of prison...

16:19.311 --> 16:22.106
I mean, I probably won't, but if I do,

16:22.731 --> 16:24.858
I'm gonna need representation.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.404
Someone who can look out for me,
help me make the right decisions,

16:28.487 --> 16:29.863
keep me out of trouble...

16:30.239 --> 16:33.158
I can recommend some excellent people.

16:49.008 --> 16:49.925
Hey.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.512
-Thought I might find you here.
-I'm trying to quit.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.764
Yeah, you look like
you're trying really hard.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.224
Don't be shitty.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.477
I haven't seen you in a while.
You doing okay?

17:00.561 --> 17:02.229
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.898
-I mean, you know, okay.
-Sure.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.568
I'm working
on this middle-grade fiction series.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.862
I mean, who am I, Rick Riordan?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.196
Who's Rick Riordan?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.366
Yeah, good point.
What have you been up to?

17:14.450 --> 17:17.286
Well, let's see, um,
I've been getting into podcasts,

17:17.369 --> 17:19.121
went through a Sudoku phase, and, uh,

17:19.204 --> 17:21.749
-oh, I'm in prison, so...
-Right. That's still happening?

17:21.832 --> 17:25.002
Oh, it's very much happening.
I've also got a new movie coming out.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.670
Oh, yeah, with Vance Waggoner, right?

17:26.795 --> 17:28.338
I know what you're thinking, but he's--

17:28.422 --> 17:30.007
You don't need to explain yourself to me.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.967
I know you think
I'm some kind of a sell-out,

17:32.051 --> 17:34.595
but it wasn't like other opportunities
were banging down my door...

17:34.678 --> 17:36.889
-I'm not arguing with you.
-Because of "Horny Unicorn"--

17:36.972 --> 17:40.017
I'm not going to help you work through
whatever you're trying to work through.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.269
I just came out here to smoke.
You came to me.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.147
-Because I wanted to talk to you.
-About what? "The Horny Unicorn"?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.274
No, about-- I don't know.

17:47.357 --> 17:51.987
I just wanted to talk to you.
I miss talking to you.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.659
I wish I had my phone right now.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.994
Yeah, I know what you mean.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.871
I never know what to do
with my hands at parties.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.664
No, I wish I had my phone

18:02.748 --> 18:05.542
so I could play you
the last voicemail you left me.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.462
Did you remember that,
that you left me a voicemail?

18:08.545 --> 18:10.422
Ooh.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.383
I thought you were sober.
You told me you were sober.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.637
And things were good in my life
and I was thinking about my future,

18:16.720 --> 18:19.807
and then I woke up one morning
and I had this voicemail.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.016
Look, I-I wasn't in the--

18:21.100 --> 18:24.103
You were happy on the voicemail.
You sounded happy.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.230
Or lightly sardonic, or glibly nihilistic,

18:26.313 --> 18:28.107
or however you'd describe
that thing you get

18:28.190 --> 18:30.359
that's the closest to the emotion
normal people call happy.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.569
-I'm sorry--
-And you were clearly intoxicated,

18:32.653 --> 18:35.823
and you were talking about swimming.
"I'm going swimming," you said.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.408
"Since nothing matters anyway,
and nobody cares about me,

18:38.492 --> 18:40.369
-I might as well go swimming, right?"
-I'm so sorry.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.663
"Call me back
if you don't want me to go swimming.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.207
Otherwise, I'm just gonna assume
you don't care."

18:47.584 --> 18:48.919
I thought you were dead.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.296
For seven hours,
I couldn't get in touch with anyone

18:51.380 --> 18:52.714
and I was sure you were dead,

18:52.798 --> 18:57.594
and it was my fault for leaving you,
for feeling good, for not worrying.

18:57.678 --> 19:01.014
When I left for Chicago,
you promised me you were gonna be okay,

19:01.098 --> 19:03.642
but I made you promise me that.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.395
-Was I selfish for believing you?
-No.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.480
Why did you call me?
You knew I was in Chicago.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.316
I don't know. I was drunk
and-- and I was high.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.985
And I just... I wanted to talk to you.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.949
When I found out you weren't dead,
I was angry.

19:19.324 --> 19:24.872
I was relieved, but I was also angry
that I'd given you that power over me.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.333
I was angry at you for a really long time.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.252
Are you still angry at me?

19:30.627 --> 19:34.381
No. I don't know.
What good has being angry at you

19:34.464 --> 19:36.008
-ever done for me?
-I'm sorry.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.218
I wish I could have been
the person you thought I was,

19:38.302 --> 19:40.470
-the person who would save you.
-That was never your job.

19:40.554 --> 19:44.266
Then why did you always make me
feel like it was?

19:44.683 --> 19:47.686
I don't know, maybe it's everybody's job
to save each other.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.396
I don't know.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.525
Anyway, I'm glad you're alive.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.943
I am, too.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.907
So, you're still in Chicago, then, or...?

20:01.366 --> 20:03.076
When I got that voicemail,

20:03.160 --> 20:08.457
my boyfriend at the time
wanted me to move to Houston with him.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.334
I wanted to move with him.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.253
But after you called, I got scared.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.547
-Oh, no.
-I didn't trust myself.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.301
I was happy and I didn't trust that.
So I stayed in Chicago.

20:19.384 --> 20:24.056
We tried to make it work long distance,
but it was hard.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.017
Eventually, I just thought,
"This is stupid."

20:27.100 --> 20:29.144
So, what, you broke up with him?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.605
No. I moved to Houston.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.315
To be with your boyfriend at the time?

20:33.398 --> 20:35.859
Yeah. Plus, the winters in Chicago
are cold as shit,

20:35.943 --> 20:37.569
I don't know why anyone
would build a city there.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.154
No wonder that cow started that fire.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.948
I get it. I'm on Team Cow.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.701
But your boyfriend at the time,
he's not your boyfriend anymore?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.537
He is not.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.249
-Wow.
-Yeah.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.002
How'd you learn how to trust it?
The happiness?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.880
I didn't. But I trust him.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.927
It's hard to imagine you in Houston.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.887
Oh, I'm like
a totally different person now.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.305
-Are you?
-No?

21:06.056 --> 21:09.935
Yes? I wear fewer jackets.
I smile more.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.981
Sometimes I look back at my LA years,
and I think, "Who was that person?"

21:14.147 --> 21:16.483
Does she ever come back, that Diane?

21:16.858 --> 21:18.360
Sometimes.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.487
I felt her when I got back to LA.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.198
I feel her now that I'm talking to you.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.783
But it's not you?

21:24.866 --> 21:26.743
I mean, it's all me.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.871
I'd love to say,
"No, she's gone forever."

21:29.955 --> 21:33.625
But I was terrified
of coming back here for the wedding.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.628
-Seeing Mr. Peanutbutter. Seeing you.
-What'd you think was gonna happen?

21:36.712 --> 21:40.841
I don't know, I would spin out,
start questioning everything,

21:40.924 --> 21:41.842
blow everything up.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.428
But that didn't happen, did it?

21:44.511 --> 21:46.430
No. That didn't happen.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.516
But was part of you
kinda hoping that it would?

21:49.599 --> 21:51.059
Mm.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.145
You ever miss the mess?

21:53.228 --> 21:55.272
No, "miss" is the wrong word.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.024
Sorry, Miss.

21:57.107 --> 22:00.527
I'm glad I lived in LA,
but I'm not nostalgic for it.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.196
I'm glad I knew Mr. Peanutbutter,

22:03.280 --> 22:05.532
-even though he's not in my life anymore.
-Yeah?

22:05.615 --> 22:09.453
I think there are people that help you
become the person that you end up being,

22:09.536 --> 22:11.747
and you can be grateful for them

22:11.830 --> 22:15.167
even if they were never
meant to be in your life forever.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.711
I'm glad I knew you, too.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.171
"Knew," huh?

22:19.254 --> 22:20.255
Mm.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.924
Hey, wouldn't it be funny

22:23.008 --> 22:25.927
if this night was the last time
we ever talked to each other?

22:29.806 --> 22:32.559
-Um, anyway, I--
-I need to tell you...

22:32.642 --> 22:34.227
No. You don't have to--
You don't owe me anything.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.897
No, I need to tell you: Thank you.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.567
And it's going to be okay.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.528
And I'm sorry.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.324
And...  thank you.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.370
-Wait.
-Why?

22:51.453 --> 22:53.955
I know. I know.
But can I just tell you a funny story?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.165
Sure.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.751
But it better be very funny.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.504
I don't wanna lie to you,
it's only kind of funny.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.674
So we have this movie night
at the prison, right?

23:04.758 --> 23:07.386
And we get to vote
on what movies we wanna see.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.179
But of course the whole thing's rigged,

23:09.262 --> 23:12.557
because Big Andy's favorite movie
is <i>The Family Stone,</i>

23:12.641 --> 23:15.268
so Big Andy gets his guys
to vote for it every week,

23:15.352 --> 23:17.771
and so every week
we watch <i>The Family Stone.</i>

23:17.854 --> 23:20.899
Hold on, whose favorite movie
is <i>The Family Stone?</i>

23:20.982 --> 23:22.651
I mean, yeah, it's a fine movie...

23:22.734 --> 23:24.194
-But every week?
-That's what I'm saying!

23:24.319 --> 23:27.572
So, one day I'm like, "If I see
Luke Wilson teach Sarah Jessica Parker

23:27.656 --> 23:30.700
how to let her freak flag fly
one more time, I'm gonna snap."

23:30.784 --> 23:33.036
I don't understand,
is movie night mandatory?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.955
-No.
-So why don't you just not go?

23:35.038 --> 23:36.998
What am I, a philistine?
I support the arts, sue me.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.125
Okay, sorry.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.086
But I know a guy
who volunteers in the library,

23:41.169 --> 23:44.464
which is where they keep the DVDs,
so I make a deal with him.

23:44.548 --> 23:48.385
"I'll give you my Jell-O for a month
if <i>The Family Stone</i> goes missing."

23:48.468 --> 23:49.928
I feel like this doesn't end well.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.973
So, movie might comes around,
time for another Christmas in Connecticut,

23:53.056 --> 23:56.685
but then, uh-oh, the DVD's gone,
what do we do?

23:56.768 --> 23:59.729
So Big Andy's getting really upset,
and his guys are all riled,

23:59.813 --> 24:01.398
and then I go, "Fellas, fellas, fellas!

24:01.481 --> 24:03.775
Why don't we watch
<i>Pieces of April </i>this week?

24:03.859 --> 24:06.069
Change of pace.
Patricia Clarkson's in it and..."

24:06.153 --> 24:06.987
And?

24:07.154 --> 24:09.156
-Prison riot.
-Oh, shit, really?

24:09.239 --> 24:12.117
No. Worse. Big Andy falls in love
with <i>Pieces of April,</i>

24:12.200 --> 24:14.161
so now we watch<i> Pieces of April</i>
every week.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.746
You kind of made your own bed
on that one.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.373
Story of my life.

24:22.669 --> 24:25.297
I'm sorry, that sounds awful.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.633
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?
Life's a bitch and then you die, right?

24:28.925 --> 24:30.177
Sometimes.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.096
Sometimes life's a bitch
and then you keep living.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.181
Yeah.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.643
But it's a nice night, huh?

24:39.227 --> 24:40.145
Yeah.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.898
This is nice.
