WEBVTT

00:34.323 --> 00:35.292
<i>Ready, B?</i>

00:35.359 --> 00:37.128
<i>Ready, T.</i>

00:37.194 --> 00:38.662
<i>Okay.</i>

00:38.728 --> 00:41.631
<i>This is the story of
our most excellent dads.</i>

00:41.698 --> 00:45.102
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

00:45.168 --> 00:47.704
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

00:48.604 --> 00:51.507
And we're Wyld Stallyns!

00:51.575 --> 00:54.412
<i>This was probably
the first time you saw 'em.</i>

00:55.279 --> 00:57.347
Let's rock!

00:58.414 --> 01:01.384
<i>And this
was probably the last.</i>

01:01.451 --> 01:03.386
<i>Not long
before we were born,</i>

01:03.453 --> 01:05.087
<i>they were told
they were gonna write a song</i>

01:05.156 --> 01:08.392
<i>that was gonna
unite the entire world.</i>

01:08.459 --> 01:09.692
<i>Which they thought
they had done</i>

01:09.760 --> 01:11.195
<i>with their hit single...</i>

01:11.260 --> 01:13.496
Those Who Rock.

01:13.563 --> 01:16.332
<i>Not only did it not
unite the world,</i>

01:17.468 --> 01:19.370
<i>but the band fell apart.</i>

01:19.436 --> 01:24.008
<i>And our dads, alone now,
were trying harder and harder.</i>

01:24.075 --> 01:26.844
<i>But the problem was,
the harder Dads tried...</i>

01:26.909 --> 01:28.311
<i>The less interested</i>

01:28.378 --> 01:30.713
<i>people seemed to be
in their music.</i>

01:30.781 --> 01:34.418
<i>Not only was it wearing
on them and on the family...</i>

01:34.484 --> 01:36.052
<i>But the universe
they were told</i>

01:36.120 --> 01:37.822
<i>they were gonna
bring together...</i>

01:37.888 --> 01:40.057
<i>Was actually
starting to unravel.</i>

01:40.123 --> 01:43.227
<i>Yeah,
time was folding in on itself.</i>

01:43.927 --> 01:45.295
<i>It was bad.</i>

01:45.361 --> 01:46.396
What, what?

01:46.462 --> 01:47.563
<i>Totally, dude.</i>

01:47.631 --> 01:48.765
Make some noise!

01:51.402 --> 01:56.106
<i>Anyways, this is how
we got to where we are now.</i>

02:00.745 --> 02:02.746
Hello,
friends and loved ones.

02:02.813 --> 02:04.781
Let us welcome you,
one and all

02:04.847 --> 02:07.951
to this
most joyous of occasions!

02:12.288 --> 02:14.890
Ted and I have known Missy
in different capacities

02:14.957 --> 02:16.860
for many decades.

02:16.926 --> 02:19.695
First, she was our babysitter
when we were ten.

02:19.763 --> 02:21.865
Then we both invited her
to the prom

02:21.931 --> 02:23.966
when she was a senior
and we were freshmen.

02:24.033 --> 02:25.269
Yeah!

02:25.335 --> 02:27.671
Two years later,
she married my dad

02:27.736 --> 02:29.606
and Missy became Mom.

02:29.673 --> 02:33.376
After divorcing Bill's dad,
she married my dad

02:33.443 --> 02:35.145
and became my mom.

02:35.211 --> 02:36.478
Yeah.

02:36.545 --> 02:38.414
And now she's marrying
Ted's little brother,

02:38.480 --> 02:40.483
Officer Deacon Logan.

02:44.455 --> 02:45.956
Yeah.

02:46.522 --> 02:48.359
Missy, Bill and I,

02:48.425 --> 02:50.961
along with my beautiful wife,
Elizabeth,

02:51.027 --> 02:52.661
and our daughter, Billie...

02:52.729 --> 02:57.434
And my beautiful wife, Joanna,
and our daughter, Thea,

02:57.501 --> 02:59.536
all wanna welcome you back...

02:59.602 --> 03:01.472
With open arms.

03:04.441 --> 03:05.908
This happy event
would seem to make

03:05.975 --> 03:07.677
Deacon his own father-in-law

03:07.743 --> 03:09.180
and Ted his own uncle.

03:09.246 --> 03:12.983
Not to mention making my dad
his own son.

03:14.616 --> 03:16.119
And with that
beautiful thought in mind,

03:16.186 --> 03:17.754
for your first dance,

03:17.820 --> 03:20.824
we wish to present you
with a matrimonial offering.

03:20.890 --> 03:22.691
A sneak peek
at the world premiere

03:22.758 --> 03:24.460
of our newest sonic creation.

03:24.527 --> 03:26.162
We're not sure
if this is going to be

03:26.229 --> 03:28.131
the song
that unites the world.

03:28.198 --> 03:29.599
We're pretty sure it might.

03:29.665 --> 03:32.468
- At least we hope.
- Yeah.

03:38.908 --> 03:43.146
Sure to be another real doozy
from the Wyld Stallyns.

03:43.212 --> 03:44.513
Check one, two.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.649
Let's dance,
Freaky Deaky.

03:50.820 --> 03:52.288
You got it, Kissy Missy.

03:52.354 --> 03:54.657
Oh, shh.
Your dad used to call me that.

03:54.724 --> 03:56.192
Totally aware of that, babe.

03:56.258 --> 03:58.961
Please enjoy the first
three movements of...

03:59.028 --> 04:01.497
<i>That Which
Binds Us Through Time...</i>

04:01.564 --> 04:06.736
<i>The Chemical, Physical, and
Biological Nature of Love...</i>

04:06.802 --> 04:11.307
<i>An Exploration of
the Meaning of Meaning.</i>

04:11.375 --> 04:13.509
<i>Part One.</i>

04:17.781 --> 04:20.750
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

04:20.817 --> 04:22.084
- One.
- Two.

04:22.151 --> 04:24.254
One, two, three, four.

05:22.178 --> 05:24.347
Dad, I've told you
a thousand times,

05:24.415 --> 05:26.617
Bill and I
have to keep going till...

05:26.682 --> 05:29.519
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Till your
music unites the world.

05:29.586 --> 05:32.422
Chief Logan, the people
in the future told us...

05:32.488 --> 05:33.789
Bill, Bill, Bill,
you didn't time-travel.

05:33.857 --> 05:35.259
We did.

05:35.324 --> 05:36.894
Your wives
aren't from medieval England.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.361
They are.

05:38.427 --> 05:39.362
And you didn't go
to Heaven and Hell.

05:39.428 --> 05:40.396
We did!

05:40.463 --> 05:41.497
- You didn't!
- We did!

05:41.564 --> 05:42.764
And you know why?

05:42.831 --> 05:46.336
Because it's impossible.

05:46.401 --> 05:48.971
Here's a real idea
for you two.

05:49.038 --> 05:50.473
Here it comes, dude.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.309
Get real jobs.

05:52.375 --> 05:55.111
Be role models
to your daughters.

05:55.177 --> 05:56.945
Oh, never mind.

05:57.012 --> 05:58.180
You are.

05:58.247 --> 06:00.149
They're 24,
they live at home

06:00.216 --> 06:01.984
and they're unemployed.

06:02.052 --> 06:03.754
You remember
when you used to call them

06:03.821 --> 06:05.055
"Little Bill," "Little Ted"?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.789
We thought
it was cute, Gramps.

06:06.855 --> 06:08.190
Hey.

06:08.257 --> 06:10.159
Yeah. Well, it turned out
to be a curse.

06:10.226 --> 06:13.362
All I ever see them do is
sit around, listen to music.

06:13.430 --> 06:14.930
That is our primary activity,

06:14.997 --> 06:16.432
- definitely.
- Yeah.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.567
You guys okay?

06:17.634 --> 06:19.169
Joanna, Elizabeth,

06:19.235 --> 06:20.870
how do you feel about being

06:20.937 --> 06:22.872
the only adults
in your families?

06:22.939 --> 06:26.910
The only ones
with actual jobs?

06:26.976 --> 06:28.411
Let's pack up.

06:28.478 --> 06:30.579
- Don't listen to him.
- Ouch.

06:31.447 --> 06:33.348
I really appreciate you
doing this.

06:33.415 --> 06:34.783
I know it wasn't your choice.

06:34.850 --> 06:36.286
Of course, Jo.

06:36.353 --> 06:37.920
I really want this
to work for both of us.

06:37.987 --> 06:39.422
Yeah.

06:39.488 --> 06:41.057
Oh, hey.

06:41.124 --> 06:42.492
How's it goin', dude?

06:42.559 --> 06:43.594
Good, dude.

06:43.660 --> 06:44.795
- Hi!
- Hey, Jo.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.129
Oh, no, no.

06:46.196 --> 06:47.797
I'm sorry,
is this the right day?

06:47.863 --> 06:49.599
Yeah, totally.

06:49.665 --> 06:52.735
So, do you understand
why this situation

06:52.802 --> 06:56.173
might seem at all strange
to your wives?

06:56.240 --> 06:58.742
No. Not at all.
Why?

06:58.809 --> 07:02.445
Well, when your wives
suggested couples therapy,

07:02.512 --> 07:05.482
do you think that this is
what they had in mind?

07:05.548 --> 07:06.782
Well, definitely.

07:06.850 --> 07:09.052
I mean, we're
a couple of couples, right?

07:09.119 --> 07:10.520
- That is true.
- Yeah.

07:10.586 --> 07:13.689
But usually,
with couples therapy,

07:13.755 --> 07:14.957
it just means one couple.

07:15.024 --> 07:16.125
That makes sense.

07:16.192 --> 07:17.627
Yeah.

07:17.694 --> 07:19.194
Well, but, you know,
we're here,

07:19.262 --> 07:20.697
so let's work with that.

07:20.764 --> 07:21.898
- Yes?
- Yeah.

07:21.964 --> 07:23.532
Okay, great.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
Um...

07:24.668 --> 07:26.903
Ted, is there something
you feel

07:26.970 --> 07:28.805
your wife needs to hear
from you?

07:28.872 --> 07:31.074
Yeah. Totally.

07:32.742 --> 07:34.811
We love you guys.

07:34.877 --> 07:37.546
Ah, that is good, dude.

07:38.081 --> 07:39.415
In a way, yes.

07:39.482 --> 07:42.119
I mean,
it is great to feel loved.

07:42.185 --> 07:44.454
But do you understand

07:44.521 --> 07:47.390
how that might sound strange
to your wives?

07:47.456 --> 07:49.293
I'll shoot this at Bill.

07:50.026 --> 07:51.026
No.

07:51.093 --> 07:52.295
I mean, we love 'em.

07:52.362 --> 07:54.164
Oh. "We love them."

07:54.230 --> 07:55.932
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We do.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.300
Okay. It's the "we" part.

07:58.367 --> 08:01.404
Um... Ted, can you say
the same thing,

08:01.471 --> 08:05.274
but instead of "we,"
say "I" in the sentence.

08:05.341 --> 08:07.877
- Oh. Yeah.
- Okay.

08:07.944 --> 08:09.446
Of course.

08:09.512 --> 08:10.447
Okay.

08:10.512 --> 08:11.981
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

08:12.048 --> 08:15.185
I and Bill love you
and Joanna.

08:15.252 --> 08:16.552
Okay.

08:16.619 --> 08:18.222
Dude,
with all due respect,

08:18.288 --> 08:19.523
I don't think
you're quite getting this.

08:19.589 --> 08:20.923
Go for it, dude.

08:20.990 --> 08:21.990
Okay.

08:22.057 --> 08:23.259
I'm gonna do one.

08:23.326 --> 08:25.195
Yes, go for it, dude.

08:25.261 --> 08:26.897
- Great.
- Okay.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.101
- Joanna?
- Mmm-hmm?

08:32.168 --> 08:35.038
From the very,
very bottom of I

08:35.105 --> 08:37.440
and Ted's hearts,

08:37.506 --> 08:43.211
I and Ted
totally love and worship you

08:43.278 --> 08:44.914
and Elizabeth.

08:46.716 --> 08:47.783
Perfect, dude.

08:47.850 --> 08:49.753
Ah, awesome, dude, thanks.

08:50.854 --> 08:56.360
Joanna, would you or Elizabeth
like to respond to that?

08:57.360 --> 08:58.861
Oh, well...

08:58.928 --> 09:00.196
Would you...

09:00.263 --> 09:04.066
Well, it has been tough
for us.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.536
At home.

09:05.601 --> 09:07.803
You know, it's been so hard
watching you

09:07.870 --> 09:11.674
beat your heads
against the wall for 25 years

09:11.740 --> 09:13.744
and I'm not sure
how much longer

09:13.809 --> 09:16.212
we can keep going on
like this.

09:16.279 --> 09:18.514
What?

09:22.052 --> 09:23.653
Well...

09:24.620 --> 09:26.188
Bill, Ted,

09:26.255 --> 09:28.190
I'd love to spend
the last part

09:28.256 --> 09:31.227
of this session
with your wives.

09:31.894 --> 09:33.295
Alone?

09:33.363 --> 09:35.832
Yes, alone.

09:35.899 --> 09:37.234
Right. Okay.

09:37.301 --> 09:40.570
We'll see you
at home, okay?

09:41.370 --> 09:43.639
Okay. All right, then.

09:44.875 --> 09:45.875
Oh, yeah.

09:45.942 --> 09:46.942
Yeah.

09:51.914 --> 09:54.583
Dude, did you know
they felt that way?

09:54.650 --> 09:56.785
We have to fix this.

09:57.620 --> 10:00.155
The thing is,
they're right, Bill.

10:00.222 --> 10:01.625
They're princesses.

10:01.692 --> 10:03.058
Yeah.

10:03.125 --> 10:04.760
We pulled them out of their
lives to be here with us.

10:04.827 --> 10:07.663
And they didn't come
all this way for this.

10:07.730 --> 10:10.267
That's why we gotta
keep working, dude.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.101
But isn't that the problem?

10:12.168 --> 10:13.235
Yeah.

10:13.302 --> 10:15.203
But it's also the solution.

10:15.270 --> 10:17.306
Yeah. I guess.

10:19.609 --> 10:21.110
Dude, this is transcendent.

10:21.177 --> 10:22.479
Is this Fillmore '66?

10:22.544 --> 10:23.947
No, Monterey Pop, '67.

10:24.013 --> 10:26.016
That second sound check
where they did that riff

10:26.081 --> 10:27.350
on <i>Amazing Grace.</i>

10:27.417 --> 10:29.085
How's it goin', Dads?

10:29.152 --> 10:30.419
How's it goin', girls?

10:30.485 --> 10:31.787
How was therapy?

10:31.854 --> 10:33.456
It went okay. Yeah.

10:33.523 --> 10:35.759
Hey, Dad, by the way,
Gramps was wrong.

10:35.825 --> 10:38.194
The wedding song
was most luminous.

10:38.260 --> 10:40.129
Oh, thank you, B.

10:40.196 --> 10:41.431
Glad you dug it, Billie.

10:41.496 --> 10:42.931
No, seriously,
Uncle Ted,

10:42.999 --> 10:44.668
when did you get so excellent
on theremin?

10:44.735 --> 10:47.137
Your playing rivaled,
and I'm not kidding,

10:47.202 --> 10:48.471
Clara Rockmore.

10:48.538 --> 10:50.005
Aw, thanks, T.

10:50.072 --> 10:52.775
Clara Rockmore
was definitely an inspiration.

10:52.842 --> 10:53.809
Yeah.

10:53.876 --> 10:55.144
- And, Uncle Bill!
- Yeah.

10:55.211 --> 10:56.511
The throat singing, I mean,

10:56.578 --> 10:59.014
it was a whole new level
of eloquence.

10:59.081 --> 11:01.216
Some serious <i>buga khoomei.</i>

11:01.283 --> 11:02.785
Whoa.

11:02.851 --> 11:05.721
Your musical acumen
is most impressive, girls.

11:08.691 --> 11:09.992
Hey, Dad,
good luck on the song.

11:10.058 --> 11:11.528
You got this.

11:23.539 --> 11:25.574
What is it, Ted?

11:26.442 --> 11:28.144
Liz is right.

11:28.211 --> 11:32.380
We have been banging our heads
against a wall for 25 years.

11:32.447 --> 11:34.917
And I'm tired, dude.

11:34.984 --> 11:36.418
Ted.

11:36.485 --> 11:38.855
We have a destiny to fulfill.

11:38.921 --> 11:40.123
Yeah.

11:40.190 --> 11:43.025
And think
about our fans, dude.

11:43.926 --> 11:46.797
Bob and Wendy
will totally understand.

11:46.863 --> 11:50.734
Eileen we haven't heard from
for several years.

11:51.466 --> 11:53.870
Bill?

11:53.937 --> 11:55.471
What?

11:56.806 --> 12:00.744
I went into
Cyrus Adler Music yesterday.

12:00.811 --> 12:04.681
He said he'd give me $6,400
for the Les Paul.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.785
Are you saying...

12:12.188 --> 12:13.889
Yeah.

12:15.091 --> 12:16.826
I think I am.

12:20.230 --> 12:21.731
Yeah.

12:24.033 --> 12:25.668
Yeah.

12:29.538 --> 12:31.508
Whoa!

12:32.908 --> 12:34.577
Dude! Dude!

12:35.044 --> 12:36.578
It's the future!

12:36.645 --> 12:40.015
Greetings,
my excellent friends.

12:40.081 --> 12:41.951
Do we know you?

12:43.019 --> 12:44.320
I'm Kelly.

12:44.386 --> 12:46.989
Wait, you're Rufus' daughter!

12:47.057 --> 12:48.457
I am.

12:48.524 --> 12:50.359
And I've been wanting to
meet you my whole life.

12:50.426 --> 12:52.427
It must be very disappointing.

12:52.495 --> 12:54.297
Not at all.

12:54.364 --> 12:56.066
We have a problem, gentlemen.

12:56.133 --> 12:59.002
Potentially,
a very serious problem.

12:59.068 --> 13:00.469
About the music?

13:00.535 --> 13:03.438
About the music.
They just wanna talk to you.

13:03.505 --> 13:05.507
Mmm-hmm.

13:05.575 --> 13:08.311
Dude, I got a very bad feeling
about this.

13:08.378 --> 13:09.846
It'll be fine, Ted.

13:09.912 --> 13:12.883
They totally love us
in the future, dude.

13:20.289 --> 13:21.656
Whoa!

13:21.724 --> 13:24.326
Dude, our dads
are totally in trouble.

13:24.393 --> 13:25.729
I feel so bad for 'em.

13:25.796 --> 13:27.097
They've been doing this
on their own

13:27.163 --> 13:28.398
for the longest time.

13:28.464 --> 13:29.665
Yeah, I wish
there was some way

13:29.731 --> 13:30.632
we could help 'em out,
you know?

13:30.700 --> 13:33.970
Yeah. But how?

13:40.277 --> 13:41.812
Whoa!

14:07.803 --> 14:09.572
- Dude.
- Yeah?

14:09.639 --> 14:10.940
The future.

14:11.006 --> 14:12.475
Yeah.

14:25.587 --> 14:27.089
Rufus.

14:28.291 --> 14:31.260
<i>Greetings,
my excellent friends.</i>

14:31.326 --> 14:33.330
<i>What you're looking at
is the original phone booth...</i>

14:33.395 --> 14:35.030
Gentlemen?

14:35.097 --> 14:37.266
<i>...that I used on my first
visit to the Great Ones</i>

14:37.332 --> 14:39.534
<i>way back in 1989.</i>

14:39.601 --> 14:41.203
<i>The prophecy tells us...</i>

14:51.081 --> 14:53.115
Bill and Ted.

14:55.485 --> 14:57.220
Step forward.

15:04.394 --> 15:06.028
How's it goin'...

15:06.096 --> 15:07.363
Great Ones?

15:07.429 --> 15:08.798
It's, uh...

15:08.864 --> 15:11.100
It's good to be back.

15:11.167 --> 15:13.970
What have you got to say
for yourselves?

15:17.974 --> 15:19.442
Be...

15:19.509 --> 15:21.576
excellent to each other.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.379
And party on, dudes.

15:23.446 --> 15:25.048
Yeah.

15:25.681 --> 15:27.850
Twenty-five years ago,

15:27.917 --> 15:30.586
Wyld Stallyns played a concert

15:30.653 --> 15:32.388
at the Grand Canyon.

15:32.455 --> 15:34.456
That's true.

15:34.524 --> 15:36.525
One month ago,

15:36.591 --> 15:38.126
you played the Elks Lodge

15:38.193 --> 15:40.329
in Barstow, California,
for 40 people,

15:40.397 --> 15:43.899
most of whom were there only
because it was $2 taco night,

15:43.966 --> 15:45.600
whatever the hell that means.

15:45.668 --> 15:48.871
- Well, yeah. We did!
- Yeah. We did!

15:50.806 --> 15:55.045
You were supposed to
unite the world in song.

16:00.383 --> 16:02.084
According to her father,

16:02.150 --> 16:05.587
a song
created by Preston/Logan...

16:05.654 --> 16:07.089
That's us, dude.

16:07.157 --> 16:11.259
...at a concert performed
by everyone in the band

16:11.326 --> 16:13.495
at 7:17 p.m.

16:13.562 --> 16:15.664
at MP 46,

16:15.730 --> 16:17.866
that's tonight,

16:17.933 --> 16:20.536
will save reality
as we know it,

16:20.602 --> 16:24.940
uniting humanity
across all time.

16:25.508 --> 16:26.743
Wait...

16:26.808 --> 16:28.677
I'm sorry.

16:28.745 --> 16:30.312
What?

16:30.379 --> 16:32.480
Did you say,

16:32.548 --> 16:35.750
"Reality as we know it"?

16:35.817 --> 16:37.886
Yes!

16:44.360 --> 16:45.894
Oh.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.168
Whoa.

16:53.369 --> 16:55.971
We need to hear the song

16:56.038 --> 17:00.109
in 77 minutes and 25 seconds.

17:00.176 --> 17:03.379
You have
everything you require.

17:03.446 --> 17:05.781
Get to work.

17:06.647 --> 17:09.416
Dude, they totally hate us.

17:09.483 --> 17:12.587
And I've never even
heard of MP 46.

17:12.654 --> 17:14.257
Yeah.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.825
Kelly!

17:16.526 --> 17:19.061
How does a song save reality?

17:19.127 --> 17:21.996
That I can't tell you,
but it has to.

17:22.064 --> 17:23.932
Somehow.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.300
The Great Turntable
is tipping.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.504
That there is the center
of space and time.

17:29.571 --> 17:33.308
San Dimas 700 years ago,
7:17 p.m.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.610
My father believed
that the song

17:35.678 --> 17:37.580
could be the nexus point
that brings

17:37.646 --> 17:39.347
humanity into rhythm
and harmony.

17:39.414 --> 17:41.017
How?

17:41.083 --> 17:42.986
We only discovered
this recently, but without it,

17:43.051 --> 17:44.753
reality will collapse,

17:44.820 --> 17:47.790
and time and space
will cease to exist.

17:48.891 --> 17:51.728
So until 7:17 p.m...

17:51.794 --> 17:53.461
Anything is possible.

17:53.528 --> 17:55.364
And after 7:17 p.m.?

17:55.431 --> 18:00.269
Without the song,
there is no after 7:17 p.m.

18:06.442 --> 18:09.411
This was my dad's.
He'd want you to have it.

18:09.478 --> 18:13.048
It'll help keep track
of the time in San Dimas.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.923
"Sometimes
things don't make sense..."

18:20.990 --> 18:24.794
"...until the end
of the story."

18:24.859 --> 18:27.296
That's what my dad
always said.

18:27.930 --> 18:30.233
I'll leave you to it?

18:41.711 --> 18:43.312
Okay.

18:43.378 --> 18:44.847
Now alls we gotta do

18:44.913 --> 18:46.915
is write the greatest song
ever written.

18:46.982 --> 18:50.685
That brings the entire world
into rhythm and harmony.

18:50.752 --> 18:53.855
And saves reality
as we know it.

18:53.923 --> 18:55.825
All through...

18:56.392 --> 18:58.027
time.

19:01.131 --> 19:01.964
Dude.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.633
We've spent our whole life

19:03.699 --> 19:06.101
trying to write the song
that will unite the world.

19:06.167 --> 19:09.170
What makes us think we can
write it in, like, 75 minutes?

19:09.238 --> 19:11.039
Ted, we had to have written
that song.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.442
The people in the future
told us we did.

19:13.509 --> 19:15.377
Yeah. I guess.

19:15.444 --> 19:18.513
Which means
we have it in us, dude.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.915
Maybe we just haven't
written it yet.

19:20.982 --> 19:22.417
Maybe we're still gonna.

19:22.484 --> 19:24.152
Well, if we haven't
written it yet,

19:24.220 --> 19:26.622
but we know
we're gonna at some point,

19:26.689 --> 19:28.824
why can't we just
go to the future

19:28.891 --> 19:30.993
when we have written it?

19:31.059 --> 19:33.229
And take it from ourselves!

19:33.296 --> 19:34.963
Yeah!

19:35.029 --> 19:36.898
Ted! You have had many

19:36.965 --> 19:39.067
counterintuitive ideas
over the years,

19:39.134 --> 19:40.537
but this is by far

19:40.603 --> 19:43.273
the counterintuitivest
of them all, dude!

19:44.240 --> 19:47.876
Except, won't that be stealing?

19:49.478 --> 19:51.346
How is that stealing

19:51.413 --> 19:54.817
if we're stealing it
from ourselves, dude?

19:55.584 --> 19:57.821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:00.256 --> 20:02.192
I hope it still works.

20:02.258 --> 20:03.593
Yeah.

20:06.028 --> 20:08.463
How far into our future
do you think we gotta go?

20:08.530 --> 20:11.099
It depends on when we think
we wrote that song.

20:11.166 --> 20:14.269
Let's be conservative.
Say, two years?

20:14.336 --> 20:15.538
Sounds good, Ted.

20:15.605 --> 20:16.971
Then, once we get the song,

20:17.038 --> 20:19.142
we'll go back home
to right before we left.

20:20.976 --> 20:22.378
And then what?

20:22.443 --> 20:26.048
Unite the world
and save reality, dude.

20:30.220 --> 20:32.288
- Bill, my friend.
- Yes, Ted, my friend?

20:32.355 --> 20:34.556
I have a feeling
things are about to change

20:34.623 --> 20:35.958
in a most outstanding way.

20:36.025 --> 20:38.194
I could not agree more.

21:00.682 --> 21:01.718
You okay, dude?

21:01.784 --> 21:03.286
Yeah. You?

21:03.353 --> 21:04.720
Yeah.

21:04.787 --> 21:06.654
Let's go say hello to
ourselves and get that song.

21:06.721 --> 21:08.691
It's a rusty bucket, dude.

21:08.758 --> 21:11.527
<i>To those who rock</i>

21:11.594 --> 21:12.894
Over here, dude.

21:12.961 --> 21:14.063
<i>They say
we're talking the talk</i>

21:14.130 --> 21:15.564
<i>But we're walking the walk</i>

21:15.631 --> 21:18.567
Wait. We're playing
<i>Those Who Rock?</i>

21:18.634 --> 21:19.734
Here?

21:19.801 --> 21:20.903
<i>...rock, yeah!</i>

21:20.970 --> 21:24.007
<i>We are those who rock</i>

21:24.073 --> 21:25.107
Everybody!

21:25.173 --> 21:27.576
<i>We are those who rock</i>

21:27.643 --> 21:28.677
Clap your hands now!

21:28.743 --> 21:31.780
<i>We are those who rock</i>

21:31.846 --> 21:33.214
<i>Yeah, rock!</i>

21:33.281 --> 21:35.417
Oh, dude, that's us!

21:39.288 --> 21:40.890
Don't look
and they won't see us, dude!

21:40.957 --> 21:43.325
Bill, wait!

21:43.392 --> 21:46.128
Go, go, go!

21:46.194 --> 21:48.931
- Almost at the van!
- Hey, us's, stop!

21:52.534 --> 21:54.136
Oh, hello!

21:54.202 --> 21:55.903
We totally forgot
you were coming.

21:55.971 --> 21:57.707
- Yeah.
- How great to see you.

21:57.773 --> 22:01.809
What are you talking about?
You totally ran away from us.

22:01.876 --> 22:04.446
Look, guys, we know exactly
what you're thinking.

22:04.512 --> 22:07.015
Why would we be playing
Open Mic Night at 6:15 p.m.

22:07.083 --> 22:10.886
when, in fact, we have become
such huge rock stars again.

22:10.952 --> 22:12.187
Yeah.

22:12.253 --> 22:13.321
Here's the answer.

22:13.388 --> 22:14.823
- Yeah.
- Us being here

22:14.890 --> 22:16.859
is humorously ironic.

22:16.925 --> 22:18.694
Do you believe us?

22:19.595 --> 22:20.596
No.

22:20.663 --> 22:21.931
Not at all.

22:21.998 --> 22:24.334
Well, I feel sorry
for you, then.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.535
Dude,
I think we came too early.

22:26.602 --> 22:29.839
These other us's
don't have the song.

22:29.905 --> 22:31.240
Why don't you go
write it yourselves

22:31.307 --> 22:34.543
instead of trying
to steal it from us?

22:34.609 --> 22:37.645
You're the one
who couldn't write it, Ted.

22:39.381 --> 22:44.019
Well, you're the one
who lost his wife, Ted.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.788
What?

22:45.855 --> 22:47.221
What are you talking about?

22:47.288 --> 22:50.326
Here's what happened, Bill.

22:50.392 --> 22:52.260
After you failed
couples therapy,

22:52.327 --> 22:55.230
Liz and Jo were visited by
other thems from the future

22:55.298 --> 22:56.632
who gave them a phone booth

22:56.699 --> 22:58.768
and sent them all
through time and space

22:58.834 --> 23:00.335
looking for just one life

23:00.402 --> 23:02.004
where they could be happy
with you!

23:02.069 --> 23:03.405
And guess what?

23:03.472 --> 23:05.440
They didn't find one!

23:05.507 --> 23:07.476
And now we've been alone
for two years

23:07.542 --> 23:10.478
'cause you sent
our wives away.

23:10.546 --> 23:11.947
No way.

23:12.013 --> 23:13.514
Yes way!

23:13.582 --> 23:15.551
Our wives have been gone
for two years

23:15.617 --> 23:17.785
and you didn't do anything
about it?

23:17.853 --> 23:19.255
Oh, you did, all right.

23:19.321 --> 23:21.489
You went back
and you made it worse!

23:21.557 --> 23:23.224
And guess what else?

23:23.291 --> 23:25.493
Your daughters
won't even talk to you.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.528
What?

23:26.596 --> 23:28.630
You're a dick, Ted.

23:28.696 --> 23:31.399
- You want a piece of me, Ted?
- Ted, he's not worth it!

23:31.467 --> 23:34.003
Hey! He's not worth it, dude.
We gotta go.

23:34.068 --> 23:37.605
Yeah!
And save our marriages.

23:37.673 --> 23:39.342
Losers! Has-beens!

23:39.407 --> 23:41.142
- Whatever!
- Stop fighting with yourself!

23:41.210 --> 23:42.644
Flashes in the pans!

23:42.711 --> 23:44.180
Stop fighting with yourself!

23:47.883 --> 23:49.451
That did not go well.

23:49.518 --> 23:52.788
Yeah. And your you is
a very contentious dickweed.

23:52.855 --> 23:55.658
Bill, we gotta go back
and talk with Liz and Jo.

23:55.724 --> 23:57.292
On it, dude.

24:04.365 --> 24:08.135
Please, Mother,
Dad said Preston/Logan

24:08.202 --> 24:10.306
and everyone in the band
will unite...

24:10.373 --> 24:13.042
I remember what he said.
Every word.

24:13.108 --> 24:14.710
Well, then,
give them a chance.

24:14.777 --> 24:16.112
I gave them a chance

24:16.179 --> 24:17.846
and everything they could
possibly need,

24:17.913 --> 24:19.682
but they bolted.

24:20.782 --> 24:22.317
Kelly,

24:22.384 --> 24:24.185
you know your father and I
agreed on everything,

24:24.252 --> 24:26.187
but there are
other interpretations

24:26.255 --> 24:28.157
of the information
he was acting on.

24:28.223 --> 24:29.758
I'm aware of that.

24:29.825 --> 24:32.394
Many on the council believe
that it is, in fact,

24:32.461 --> 24:34.229
the death of Bill and Ted

24:34.296 --> 24:36.765
that will bring the new epoch.

24:36.832 --> 24:39.935
Well, I disagree
with that completely!

24:40.001 --> 24:41.569
That's atrocious!

24:41.636 --> 24:44.438
Well, maybe someday
when you're the Great Leader,

24:44.506 --> 24:45.975
you can make the decisions

24:46.041 --> 24:48.209
that will affect
all time and space.

24:48.277 --> 24:50.979
You could just say "Leader."

24:51.046 --> 24:52.581
- So pretentious.
- Is it ready?

24:52.647 --> 24:55.750
Yes,
Great Leader. It should be.

24:55.817 --> 24:56.785
"Should be"?

24:56.852 --> 24:58.053
Is.

24:58.119 --> 24:59.954
Madam.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.258
Do you know who I am?

25:03.192 --> 25:06.295
Yes, Great Leader.

25:11.866 --> 25:13.801
You know what to do.

25:13.868 --> 25:17.173
You must not fail.

25:17.573 --> 25:18.740
Must...

25:18.807 --> 25:20.041
not...

25:20.108 --> 25:21.711
fail.

25:28.651 --> 25:31.452
I cannot believe you're gonna
kill Bill and Ted!

25:31.519 --> 25:33.221
Dad would be so mad at you.

25:33.288 --> 25:36.057
We're out of options, Kel.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.693
The unravelling
has already begun.

25:55.277 --> 25:56.845
Future dude! You're back?

25:56.912 --> 25:59.848
I'm looking for your fathers.
Have they been here?

26:00.816 --> 26:02.285
No.

26:09.090 --> 26:10.391
Where are our dads?

26:10.459 --> 26:11.826
They're in a tribulation,
aren't they?

26:11.894 --> 26:13.362
They are.

26:13.429 --> 26:14.430
Listen, you didn't see
a scary-looking robot

26:14.496 --> 26:15.730
from the future, did you?

26:15.798 --> 26:17.098
Oh, what? No.

26:17.165 --> 26:19.300
My mom, who overreacts
about everything

26:19.366 --> 26:21.470
- just sent one.
- To get our dads?

26:21.537 --> 26:23.538
Don't worry.
I won't let that happen.

26:23.605 --> 26:26.409
Well, we're trying
to help 'em, too.

26:27.108 --> 26:28.343
Hey.

26:28.410 --> 26:31.214
Hey, this can go, like...

26:32.580 --> 26:35.384
like, anywhere, right?
Like, all throughout time?

26:35.451 --> 26:37.353
That's correct,
but I need to stay.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.354
My guess is that
my mom's emissary

26:39.421 --> 26:40.756
will be looking for them here.

26:40.823 --> 26:42.425
Well,

26:42.490 --> 26:43.759
Thea and I were gonna help
our dads with their music

26:43.826 --> 26:45.293
by putting together
samples for 'em.

26:45.359 --> 26:46.727
Yeah, but now it appears

26:46.795 --> 26:48.563
we could put together
an actual band.

26:48.630 --> 26:49.865
I mean, it's just
them, and they're all alone!

26:49.932 --> 26:51.599
Hey, so, do you mind

26:51.666 --> 26:53.201
while you stay here and wait
for the scary-looking robot,

26:53.269 --> 26:54.569
you could show us
how to use the booth?

26:58.307 --> 26:59.941
Dude, we gotta remember.

27:00.008 --> 27:01.375
Make it better, not worse!

27:01.442 --> 27:03.711
Yeah.
I hope they're still there.

27:03.778 --> 27:06.748
It's just that the job that
they've been given, it is...

27:06.815 --> 27:08.549
- Impossible.
- ...impossible.

27:08.616 --> 27:10.284
Joanna!

27:10.352 --> 27:11.453
- Elizabeth!
- Hi!

27:11.519 --> 27:12.854
We need to talk to you.

27:12.921 --> 27:14.288
Oh, and we're back.

27:14.355 --> 27:15.891
This is super important,
Dr. Wood.

27:15.958 --> 27:18.393
We just saw ourselves
two years in the future.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.760
Wait, you're
time-travelling again?

27:19.827 --> 27:21.730
Only to save reality
as we know it.

27:21.797 --> 27:23.132
Okay. Maybe...

27:23.199 --> 27:24.699
But we just found out
something way worse.

27:24.766 --> 27:26.268
- You're leaving us.
- What?

27:26.335 --> 27:28.769
- What? No, we're not.
- No, are we?

27:28.836 --> 27:30.105
Yes. You are.

27:30.172 --> 27:32.641
Yeah. And you have real
good reason to, Jo.

27:32.708 --> 27:34.375
'Cause
we seriously appear

27:34.442 --> 27:35.845
to be living in our van.

27:35.911 --> 27:38.346
Oh, dude, we are totally
living in that van.

27:38.413 --> 27:40.015
And I'm drinking way too much.

27:40.082 --> 27:41.250
Darling, you don't even drink.

27:41.317 --> 27:42.550
Not yet.

27:42.617 --> 27:43.952
But I'm going to. A lot.

27:44.019 --> 27:45.788
- What?
- Yeah. And the lying.

27:45.855 --> 27:47.923
You cannot believe
what liars we are.

27:47.989 --> 27:50.925
Yeah, desperate, pathetic,
lying losers.

27:50.992 --> 27:52.560
Oh, no!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

27:52.627 --> 27:54.362
Okay, let's stop for a moment

27:54.430 --> 27:56.498
and take notice
of the dynamic.

27:56.565 --> 27:59.301
Uh, threatened by the thought
of losing your...

27:59.367 --> 28:00.402
Princesses.

28:00.469 --> 28:01.737
Sure. That's a word.

28:01.804 --> 28:03.438
No, we actually
are princesses.

28:03.505 --> 28:05.707
We were born in 1410.
1408.

28:05.773 --> 28:08.943
Okay.
What about us leaving you?

28:09.010 --> 28:10.112
Oh, man.

28:10.179 --> 28:12.214
That's totally why we're here.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.515
Yeah. To prove that we're not

28:13.582 --> 28:14.984
the losers
we just saw we were.

28:15.049 --> 28:17.353
Even though those loser us's
tried to tell us

28:17.420 --> 28:18.921
not to come and talk to you.

28:18.987 --> 28:21.123
Yeah. Like we were somehow
gonna make it worse.

28:22.724 --> 28:25.727
But we're not
making it worse, right?

28:26.394 --> 28:27.662
Elizabeth?

28:27.729 --> 28:29.230
- Joanna?
- Hmm?

28:29.298 --> 28:30.865
Dr. Wood?

28:30.932 --> 28:32.267
Huh?

28:32.334 --> 28:33.769
Dude,
we totally made it worse.

28:33.836 --> 28:36.505
- We'll be back.
- And make it better.

28:36.571 --> 28:39.740
When you say 1408,
you mean the year...

28:39.807 --> 28:41.676
- Oh, one last thing.
- Yeah.

28:41.742 --> 28:44.012
Older yous from the future
are just about to show up

28:44.078 --> 28:45.246
to take you on a trip

28:45.314 --> 28:46.782
in search of a happy life
with us.

28:46.848 --> 28:49.416
Don't go. 'Cause you're not
gonna find one.

28:49.483 --> 28:50.518
Yeah, but you're gonna go.

28:50.585 --> 28:51.819
- So, don't go.
- So, go?

28:51.886 --> 28:54.121
No. I guess, go.

28:54.189 --> 28:55.624
We love you guys.

28:55.691 --> 28:57.526
We're gonna fix it.

29:02.329 --> 29:03.698
That went terrible, dude.

29:03.766 --> 29:05.500
Two years forward
was clearly not enough.

29:05.567 --> 29:07.201
Let's try five this time.

29:07.268 --> 29:09.136
Dude, I miss Liz already.

29:09.203 --> 29:10.672
Hang in there, Ted.

29:10.739 --> 29:12.473
Things are about to get
a whole lot better.

29:12.539 --> 29:14.076
What time is it, dude?

29:14.142 --> 29:16.412
Fifty-eight minutes.

29:16.478 --> 29:17.746
Okay, let's go.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.862
Actually, we have to go, too.

29:33.929 --> 29:37.399
Right. Those older us's
they referred to are outside.

29:37.465 --> 29:38.800
I'm a little bit nervous

29:38.867 --> 29:40.201
to time-travel again,
to be honest.

29:40.268 --> 29:41.236
As am I.
We haven't time-traveled

29:41.301 --> 29:42.770
in more than two decades.

29:42.837 --> 29:44.373
- No, I know.
- You know what, ladies?

29:44.440 --> 29:45.472
I'd like to recommend
we see each other

29:45.539 --> 29:47.442
a minimum of two to three,

29:47.509 --> 29:49.010
five days a week.

29:49.076 --> 29:51.180
- All right, then.
- Lovely, lovely. Thank you.

30:00.255 --> 30:02.157
No. No.

30:02.223 --> 30:03.725
No!

30:18.506 --> 30:19.574
It worked.

30:19.641 --> 30:21.744
Most indubitably.

30:23.578 --> 30:25.113
You sure this is it?

30:56.010 --> 30:58.012
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Jimi Hendrix?

30:58.079 --> 31:01.449
Can I just say it is an honor
to be in your presence, dude?

31:01.516 --> 31:05.519
I mean, <i>Electric Ladyland,</i>
what can we even say?

31:05.586 --> 31:06.821
Who are you two?

31:06.888 --> 31:08.355
Oh. Um...

31:08.423 --> 31:10.959
Willamina "Billie" S. Logan,
and Thea "Theodora" Preston.

31:11.026 --> 31:14.363
Yeah. We're here for our dads
to help them unite the world.

31:14.430 --> 31:16.999
Like, no exaggeration,
literally unite the world.

31:17.066 --> 31:18.933
By putting together
a killer band for 'em,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.702
and we had to start
with you, dude.

31:20.769 --> 31:22.436
So, question...

31:22.503 --> 31:26.273
how would you like to be a key
part of this epochal song?

31:26.340 --> 31:29.177
No.

31:35.183 --> 31:37.251
Dude, we have to have
Jimi Hendrix.

31:37.318 --> 31:38.787
Yeah.

31:38.854 --> 31:40.855
But how are we gonna get him
to be in a band

31:40.923 --> 31:42.457
with people he hasn't
even heard of?

31:42.523 --> 31:44.392
Well, okay.

31:44.460 --> 31:47.296
Who's somebody
he has heard of?

32:15.390 --> 32:17.793
<i>Oh, when the saints</i>

32:17.859 --> 32:19.627
<i>Go marching in</i>

32:19.694 --> 32:23.698
<i>Oh, when the saints
go marching in</i>

32:23.765 --> 32:27.636
<i>Well, I want to be
in that number</i>

32:27.702 --> 32:30.904
<i>Oh, when the saints
go marching in</i>

32:30.971 --> 32:33.841
All right, all right,
all right. All right.

32:33.907 --> 32:37.744
Can I help you, young ladies?

32:37.811 --> 32:39.480
Uh, we're so sorry.

32:39.548 --> 32:43.852
Please excuse us,
Mr. Armstrong, sir.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.820
Uh...

32:45.886 --> 32:49.389
Might we have a word with you?

32:51.826 --> 32:54.395
So, that is <i>Amazing Grace</i>

32:54.462 --> 32:56.798
played by a Mr. Jimi Hendrix.

32:56.865 --> 32:58.767
Who's in the band.

32:58.833 --> 33:00.502
And specifically requested
your presence, so...

33:00.567 --> 33:02.203
And here's why.

33:02.269 --> 33:03.837
Your improvisations,
obviously influenced

33:03.904 --> 33:05.240
by Bunk Johnson
and King Oliver...

33:05.307 --> 33:07.075
Yeah, but ultimately
<i>sui generis.</i>

33:07.142 --> 33:09.144
...totally inspired him, sir.

33:09.211 --> 33:10.812
You gotta come
see this, fellas.

33:10.878 --> 33:12.179
What you got there, Lou?

33:12.247 --> 33:13.715
You liberated
all music, dude.

33:13.781 --> 33:16.049
Hey, what's that doohickey?

33:24.326 --> 33:25.827
Damn it!

33:29.230 --> 33:30.598
We did it!

33:30.665 --> 33:32.768
Dude, look at where we live!

33:32.834 --> 33:34.570
One song did all this?

33:34.636 --> 33:36.270
Ted, what if it wasn't
just one song?

33:36.336 --> 33:38.972
What if after we wrote it
and saved the universe,

33:39.039 --> 33:42.076
a dam broke and the songs
just kept comin' and comin'?

33:42.144 --> 33:43.010
Oh, yeah.

33:51.019 --> 33:52.452
Hello!

33:52.519 --> 33:55.257
Younger us's, hello!

33:55.324 --> 33:56.591
- Hello!
- Hello!

33:56.657 --> 33:58.959
This time,
we were expecting you.

33:59.027 --> 34:01.962
Yes, and unlike those
sad Open Mic blokes

34:02.029 --> 34:03.365
from three years ago...

34:03.432 --> 34:04.999
We are now finally able

34:05.066 --> 34:07.536
to muster some compassion
for them.

34:07.602 --> 34:09.835
...we actually do have...

34:09.902 --> 34:11.739
...the goods.

34:13.608 --> 34:16.545
To your futures.

34:16.612 --> 34:19.181
- We did it, dude.
- Yeah!

34:19.248 --> 34:21.150
Cheers!

34:25.085 --> 34:28.822
So, uh, why do you both have
English accents?

34:28.889 --> 34:32.460
Ah. Funny story. Please.

34:34.728 --> 34:37.164
Once Bill and I were knighted,

34:37.231 --> 34:40.168
things got so good
with Liz and Jo

34:40.235 --> 34:42.170
that we decided, as families,

34:42.237 --> 34:46.407
to start summering
in medieval England.

34:46.474 --> 34:50.143
And I suppose it just
bloody well rubbed off!

34:51.478 --> 34:54.648
And I can't say how chuffed
we are about it.

34:54.715 --> 34:58.186
That is such a relief!

35:01.322 --> 35:02.757
I must say,

35:02.824 --> 35:05.393
as much as I disliked
those previous us's,

35:05.460 --> 35:06.760
I like these us's.

35:06.827 --> 35:08.028
Yeah. I didn't have
a big problem

35:08.096 --> 35:09.463
with that other me,

35:09.530 --> 35:12.166
but I do like this other me
even more.

35:12.233 --> 35:13.501
Yeah.

35:14.936 --> 35:16.638
Enough talking, mates.

35:16.704 --> 35:18.005
Are you ready...

35:18.072 --> 35:20.041
...for everything...

35:22.643 --> 35:24.445
...to change?

35:30.719 --> 35:32.421
Whoa.

35:46.235 --> 35:48.469
That is truly...

35:48.536 --> 35:51.940
the most amazing song...

35:52.007 --> 35:54.809
I have ever heard.

35:55.510 --> 35:57.179
It's great.

35:57.246 --> 35:59.814
Honestly, I wouldn't have
thought we had it in us.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.083
Ah.

36:02.483 --> 36:04.018
But you do!

36:04.085 --> 36:06.221
And now it's time...

36:07.822 --> 36:10.424
to get it out to the world.

36:11.827 --> 36:13.162
Yeah!

36:17.798 --> 36:19.967
I'll never forget you,
Sir Bill.

36:20.034 --> 36:23.404
Right back at you,
Billie boyo.

36:25.739 --> 36:27.875
So long, I guess.

36:27.943 --> 36:29.311
And thanks!

36:29.378 --> 36:30.510
Yeah.

36:30.577 --> 36:31.978
So long.

36:32.045 --> 36:34.115
Tallyho!

36:37.251 --> 36:38.786
Marvelous!

36:38.853 --> 36:41.021
Ted, why were you acting
so weird with yourself, dude?

36:41.088 --> 36:43.324
I don't know. I always seem
to act weird with myself.

36:43.391 --> 36:45.961
Yeah, you do!
You gotta get over that, dude.

36:46.027 --> 36:48.096
We got the song!

36:49.931 --> 36:51.733
Dave Grohl!

36:51.800 --> 36:54.635
Who are you guys?

36:54.702 --> 36:56.271
What're you doin' in my house?

36:56.338 --> 36:57.772
Oh, no.

36:57.838 --> 37:00.041
No, no, no.

37:10.284 --> 37:12.052
Now we'll wait
for those other us's

37:12.119 --> 37:14.088
to go back
and change everything.

37:14.155 --> 37:17.225
To our lives
getting a whole lot better.

37:17.291 --> 37:18.626
Yeah.

37:20.362 --> 37:24.365
Ted, seriously, slow down
on the vodka, dude.

37:26.335 --> 37:28.068
You guys totally lied to us!

37:28.135 --> 37:30.838
Why haven't you taken the song
back to San Dimas?

37:30.905 --> 37:33.242
Maybe 'cause it's not
our song!

37:33.307 --> 37:34.809
Poppycock!

37:34.876 --> 37:36.278
It's Dave Grohl's!

37:36.344 --> 37:39.481
And he's outside right now
calling the cops.

37:40.949 --> 37:42.184
Ted, I told you

37:42.250 --> 37:43.652
Dave Grohl came back
this week.

37:43.717 --> 37:45.319
Totally thought
he came back next week.

37:45.387 --> 37:47.488
What were you guys
even thinking?

37:47.554 --> 37:49.856
Just 'cause you two couldn't
come up with a great song...

37:49.923 --> 37:51.391
And Dave Grohl did!

37:51.458 --> 37:53.527
...doesn't mean we should
be punished for that.

37:54.628 --> 37:56.264
We're not gonna do it.

37:57.599 --> 37:59.067
You have to!

37:59.134 --> 38:01.101
It's your only chance
to get our wives back.

38:01.168 --> 38:02.936
You were lying about that?

38:03.003 --> 38:04.905
Of course we were lying.

38:04.972 --> 38:06.541
Oh, man.

38:06.606 --> 38:08.375
Yeah, they don't want anything
to do with you!

38:08.443 --> 38:10.045
'Cause they traveled
all through time

38:10.112 --> 38:12.046
and finally realized
you are losers.

38:12.112 --> 38:15.016
Yeah, 'cause you make
bad choices!

38:15.083 --> 38:16.550
Like this!

38:17.552 --> 38:19.354
Now, take the song!

38:19.420 --> 38:20.888
Guys, seriously,

38:20.956 --> 38:23.024
you don't have to
pull guns on us.

38:23.090 --> 38:25.793
Yeah? Watch what happens
when we don't.

38:27.661 --> 38:29.129
See?

38:29.197 --> 38:31.965
I have to admit, Bill.
You were right.

38:32.032 --> 38:33.201
Ted!

38:33.268 --> 38:35.336
- You have to do it.
- Yeah!

38:35.402 --> 38:36.870
- Our life is hell!
- Yeah!

38:36.938 --> 38:37.905
And if you don't go back
and change it...

38:37.972 --> 38:39.273
Change it!

38:51.452 --> 38:55.290
This ends now.
The lies, the delusions.

38:55.356 --> 38:57.459
I'm done with him.
I'm done with both of them.

38:57.525 --> 38:59.059
You're not
gonna kill Ted, Dad.

38:59.126 --> 39:01.596
He broke into
Dave Grohl's house!

39:01.661 --> 39:02.963
Dad, slow down.

39:03.030 --> 39:04.599
We don't have
the whole story yet.

39:06.835 --> 39:09.838
Can't get away from us,
Bill and Ted.

39:09.905 --> 39:11.306
Ted, they're right.
They're us.

39:11.371 --> 39:13.373
They remember
everything we're gonna do!

39:13.440 --> 39:15.042
That means
we gotta do something

39:15.110 --> 39:17.445
we can't possibly remember.

39:18.413 --> 39:19.981
Shoot 'em.

39:22.351 --> 39:25.253
Oh, no.
They're gonna do the thing.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.688
I was hoping

39:26.755 --> 39:28.890
they wouldn't remember
that this time.

39:30.992 --> 39:33.362
No one leaves the building.

39:47.074 --> 39:48.275
Dude, what do we do?

39:48.342 --> 39:50.310
No idea,
that's the point!

39:50.378 --> 39:51.612
I'm confused!

39:51.679 --> 39:53.181
Me, too!

39:59.219 --> 40:00.855
Ted, that totally worked!

40:00.922 --> 40:03.625
Yeah. Maybe we should always
not know what we're doing.

40:03.692 --> 40:05.226
Time?

40:05.860 --> 40:07.428
Forty-seven minutes.

40:07.494 --> 40:09.262
All right, we gotta keep going
further into the future.

40:09.329 --> 40:11.465
At some point,
we must've written that song.

40:11.532 --> 40:13.668
- Try in five years.
- Okay.

40:18.005 --> 40:19.673
Dude.

40:19.740 --> 40:20.907
What's that?

40:20.974 --> 40:22.677
I don't know.

40:22.744 --> 40:25.847
But it's most alarming.

40:25.913 --> 40:27.382
- Bill?
- I'm tryin', dude.

40:27.449 --> 40:29.617
- Bill?
- Almost there, dude.

40:29.684 --> 40:31.319
Bill!

40:31.686 --> 40:33.153
I got it!

40:54.342 --> 40:57.378
Come on! You again? I said no.

40:57.445 --> 40:59.713
To us. But I bet
you can't say no to this man.

40:59.780 --> 41:02.483
Mr. Jimi Hendrix,
meet Mr. Louis Armstrong.

41:02.550 --> 41:06.688
That lick you played
was the cat's meow, man.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.456
It's blues, but also...

41:08.523 --> 41:10.725
What's the word you used,
young ladies?

41:10.791 --> 41:13.527
- Psychedelic.
- Psychedelic.

41:13.594 --> 41:15.429
Exactly.

41:15.496 --> 41:17.498
Very funny, whoever you are.

41:17.565 --> 41:20.934
Louis Armstrong's,
like, 65 years old.

41:21.001 --> 41:22.269
Dude, dude, I told you

41:22.336 --> 41:23.704
we should've gotten
older Louis.

41:23.771 --> 41:25.840
It was your idea, too!

41:25.907 --> 41:30.812
Well, the young ladies
picked me up in 1922, Jim.

41:30.878 --> 41:33.181
Which supports both that
we're putting together

41:33.248 --> 41:35.016
a most extraordinary band...

41:35.083 --> 41:36.751
Yeah. And that we are doing so

41:36.818 --> 41:38.787
by traveling
all throughout time.

41:38.853 --> 41:41.188
Come on, give me a break.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.503
He dug that jive, hey?

41:55.570 --> 41:57.238
<i>Potato Head Blues?</i>

41:57.304 --> 41:58.639
What kind of title is that?

41:58.706 --> 42:01.208
A definitive one,
Mr. Armstrong.

42:01.275 --> 42:02.842
So, what you're all saying

42:02.909 --> 42:07.047
is that you love a song
that I wrote in my future?

42:07.114 --> 42:08.349
Which is in your past.

42:08.416 --> 42:11.286
But we're all here
in this present.

42:11.353 --> 42:15.188
Which is actually the past?

42:15.255 --> 42:16.857
Exactly, gentlemen.

42:18.193 --> 42:19.895
Fascinating.

42:29.369 --> 42:32.873
<i>Herr</i> Mozart.
Now we're talkin'.

44:02.563 --> 44:05.467
Yeah!
Hey, Wolfie.

44:06.735 --> 44:08.269
Jimi.

44:13.940 --> 44:16.743
Dude, the future totally
sent a killer robot after us.

44:16.811 --> 44:19.748
That's why we gotta find
the song, dude.

44:26.387 --> 44:27.889
Hopeless,

44:27.954 --> 44:29.389
helpless dying breath.

44:29.456 --> 44:32.559
Hopeless,
helpless dying breath.

44:32.626 --> 44:35.395
This can't possibly be
the song, dude.

44:35.463 --> 44:36.865
- Pain!
- Pain!

44:36.931 --> 44:38.398
- Death!
- Death!

44:38.465 --> 44:41.168
Welcome to...

44:41.235 --> 44:42.902
...the end!

44:45.505 --> 44:47.107
No way!

44:47.175 --> 44:49.878
- Enough! Stop!
- Enough! Stop!

44:51.978 --> 44:53.313
Come forward.

44:53.380 --> 44:56.182
How's it goin', Bill and Ted?

44:56.250 --> 44:57.483
How'd you like our song?

44:57.550 --> 45:00.253
- Is that a song?
- Yes!

45:00.320 --> 45:01.989
It's a little
on the dark side,

45:02.056 --> 45:04.692
but, you know, that's cool.

45:04.759 --> 45:06.126
Why are you guys in prison?

45:06.193 --> 45:08.396
Oh, maybe because
you guys left us

45:08.461 --> 45:10.563
to take the fall
five years ago.

45:10.630 --> 45:12.732
Ah. That's funny,
'cause for us

45:12.800 --> 45:14.535
it's only, like,
five minutes ago.

45:14.601 --> 45:17.038
- Huh?
- So, we'll be leaving now.

45:17.105 --> 45:19.373
You're not goin' anywhere,
pretty boy.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.641
We've been waiting for years

45:20.708 --> 45:22.210
to make things right.

45:22.277 --> 45:23.878
But everything's
gonna be different.

45:23.945 --> 45:28.115
'Cause unlike those last us's,
we actually have a song.

45:28.181 --> 45:29.183
Is it a song?

45:29.250 --> 45:30.851
Yes!

45:30.918 --> 45:34.521
Bill, Ted, seriously,
we can't take that song back.

45:34.588 --> 45:37.391
Oh, you're not taking it back,
Curly.

45:37.458 --> 45:38.826
We're taking it back!

45:38.891 --> 45:40.627
You're gonna stay here
and rot

45:40.695 --> 45:43.264
and we're gonna go get lives
and our wives back!

45:43.331 --> 45:44.398
And unite the world!

45:44.465 --> 45:45.666
And save reality!

45:45.733 --> 45:47.836
- You are?
- Yes!

45:52.606 --> 45:54.609
Freeze, Preston/Logan.

45:54.675 --> 45:56.644
You know what happens
if he kills them, dude.

45:56.710 --> 45:58.879
He kills us, dude.

46:01.014 --> 46:02.315
Hold on!

46:02.382 --> 46:04.451
You want some
Bill and Ted, punk?

46:06.253 --> 46:07.388
Get him!

46:12.559 --> 46:14.061
That was not a song.

46:14.128 --> 46:15.363
Hmm?

46:15.429 --> 46:18.398
You're being a rotten idiot!

46:18.465 --> 46:19.800
That was horrible, dude.

46:19.867 --> 46:21.369
Those are the worst
us's yet, dude!

46:21.436 --> 46:22.437
Yeah. They did
save us, though.

46:22.503 --> 46:23.503
Yeah.

46:23.570 --> 46:25.139
Oh, no!

46:25.206 --> 46:26.807
- Jo!
- Liz!

46:26.875 --> 46:28.442
- Oh, hi!
- How's it goin'?

46:28.509 --> 46:31.679
- Good.
- Oh, my God, is that you?

46:32.646 --> 46:34.280
- No, no, no!
- We love you guys.

46:34.347 --> 46:35.849
- You've gotta go.
- You should probably go.

46:35.916 --> 46:37.552
- All right.
- Okay.

46:37.619 --> 46:38.818
- We're gonna fix it!
- I got it.

46:38.885 --> 46:40.086
Oh, good Lord.
Oh, good heavens.

46:44.324 --> 46:45.492
Dude, what now?

46:45.559 --> 46:46.927
The watch says
sometimes things

46:46.994 --> 46:48.762
don't make sense
till the end of the story.

46:48.829 --> 46:50.331
So?

46:50.398 --> 46:52.700
Maybe we gotta go all the way
to the end to find out, Ted.

46:52.766 --> 46:56.403
Most... non-triumphant.

46:56.471 --> 46:57.905
Pull yourself together.

46:57.972 --> 47:00.007
You're a robot!

47:00.074 --> 47:02.543
<i>Get to where
they're going next and wait.</i>

47:03.510 --> 47:05.880
We are running out of time.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.724
The myth of Ling Lun
turns out to be true, T.

47:17.791 --> 47:21.228
I know. And she's a she.

47:42.583 --> 47:44.251
Oh.

47:49.523 --> 47:51.324
Hey,
you wanna be in our band?

47:52.760 --> 47:54.896
- Yeah.
- Oh.

48:04.572 --> 48:06.474
Grom.
You're gonna love her.

48:06.539 --> 48:10.010
Ling Lun says she's the
greatest drummer of all time.

48:13.380 --> 48:15.083
What?

48:27.228 --> 48:30.998
Hello. Excuse me. Hi.
Miss... Miss Grom...

48:35.902 --> 48:38.939
Well, I'm trying to save
the world, too, Mother.

48:39.007 --> 48:41.809
It's not like your
generation's done that great.

48:43.610 --> 48:46.246
It's getting worse and worse
here, if you were wondering.

48:47.447 --> 48:49.216
Ah. Well, the Sahara Desert

48:49.284 --> 48:52.019
just showed up
in San Dimas, Mother.

48:52.085 --> 48:53.120
Queen Elizabeth

48:53.186 --> 48:54.989
is looking right at it.

48:55.054 --> 48:58.925
No. No, I'm not
gonna tell you where I am.

48:58.992 --> 49:00.760
Because how do I know
you won't send

49:00.827 --> 49:03.697
your killer robot
after me, Mom?

49:07.101 --> 49:08.202
I gotta go, Mom.

49:11.405 --> 49:14.474
This is bad.
This is really happening.

49:14.541 --> 49:16.177
What's happening?

49:17.311 --> 49:20.181
Whoa! Kid Cudi!

49:20.248 --> 49:22.081
Hey, how's it goin', dude?

49:22.148 --> 49:24.719
Can someone please tell me
what the hell is happening?

49:24.786 --> 49:27.021
Basically, all time and space
are about to end

49:27.088 --> 49:30.490
unless their dads come up
with a song by 7:17 p.m.

49:30.556 --> 49:32.492
- Wait. What?
- Wait. What?

49:32.559 --> 49:34.228
We thought this was
about the music.

49:34.295 --> 49:37.030
It is. It's also about
the end of space and time.

49:37.097 --> 49:39.565
Dude, this is way worse
than we thought.

49:39.632 --> 49:43.270
So, this is some kind of error
in our holographic dual field?

49:43.336 --> 49:44.572
Or is it a Wilsonian loop

49:44.637 --> 49:46.239
causing a temporal
singularity?

49:46.306 --> 49:47.675
Well, seems to me your

49:47.742 --> 49:49.276
classical tautological
causal circuit.

49:49.342 --> 49:51.411
I don't know. Seems like
textbook entanglement to me.

49:51.478 --> 49:52.879
I must say, your understanding

49:52.945 --> 49:54.815
of our dire circumstance
is most impressive.

49:54.882 --> 49:56.951
You should put it to good use
and help us save reality!

49:57.018 --> 49:58.418
Yeah!

49:58.485 --> 49:59.954
That's great. 'Cause it is
the end of space and time.

50:00.021 --> 50:01.355
Right.

50:01.422 --> 50:03.925
Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Hendrix,
<i>Herr</i> Mozart,

50:03.992 --> 50:06.727
Miss Grom, Miss Ling Lun,
and Mr. Cudi,

50:06.793 --> 50:08.195
we're gonna take you
into our dads' studio

50:08.262 --> 50:09.597
and start practicing.

50:09.664 --> 50:11.065
So that when our dads
get back here

50:11.130 --> 50:12.432
with the song
that will unite the world,

50:12.500 --> 50:13.434
you guys can play it for 'em.

50:13.501 --> 50:15.069
Sound good?

50:15.135 --> 50:17.871
Let's get practicing.

50:19.005 --> 50:20.206
Oh.

50:20.273 --> 50:21.909
Bogus.

50:27.782 --> 50:29.383
Oops.

50:29.449 --> 50:31.852
I'm so sorry, Great Leader.

50:32.452 --> 50:34.253
Oh, no.

50:34.320 --> 50:36.857
Oh... Oh, no.

50:39.626 --> 50:40.862
Oh, no.

50:46.333 --> 50:49.168
Are you okay?

50:49.235 --> 50:50.503
I think so, dude.

50:50.570 --> 50:52.371
Are you okay?

50:52.438 --> 50:53.641
I think so, dude.

50:55.643 --> 50:57.411
Dude, where are we?

51:04.385 --> 51:05.920
Are you guys okay?

51:05.987 --> 51:08.021
My mother
just had me killed.

51:08.088 --> 51:11.426
I didn't think she'd actually
do it, but she did.

51:22.369 --> 51:27.207
Our sincerest apologies that
we're here, great musicians.

51:27.273 --> 51:30.210
We just wanted
to help our dads.

51:31.043 --> 51:35.148
Which we clearly
utterly failed at.

51:54.469 --> 51:55.769
Time?

51:56.704 --> 51:58.806
6:48 p.m.

52:06.414 --> 52:08.082
Whoa.

52:14.288 --> 52:15.757
Dude!

52:17.224 --> 52:19.693
Are Jo and Liz here?

52:19.760 --> 52:21.796
Yes.

52:27.735 --> 52:29.771
And no.

52:32.505 --> 52:34.540
What did you mean

52:34.608 --> 52:37.445
"yes and no"?

52:37.510 --> 52:40.847
There are infinite pasts.

52:40.914 --> 52:45.918
Each is entangled
with infinite futures.

52:45.985 --> 52:47.653
So, what are you sayin'?

52:47.721 --> 52:50.056
Where you end up...

52:50.556 --> 52:52.292
all depends...

52:52.360 --> 52:54.461
on what happens...

52:54.527 --> 52:56.163
with this.

52:56.230 --> 52:57.530
Is that...

52:57.597 --> 53:01.501
It's the answer to everything.

53:03.637 --> 53:04.972
It's called...

53:05.806 --> 53:08.909
<i>Face The Music.</i>

53:15.248 --> 53:16.683
Dudes...

53:16.750 --> 53:18.751
who is that on guitar?

53:18.818 --> 53:21.322
It's you two.

53:21.889 --> 53:23.757
It is us.

53:31.797 --> 53:34.134
<i>Face The Music.</i>

53:36.003 --> 53:37.671
Preston/Logan!

53:37.737 --> 53:42.309
Recorded at 7:17 p.m.

53:42.376 --> 53:45.913
At MP 46.

53:45.980 --> 53:49.248
It's in your hands now.

53:49.750 --> 53:52.485
Go make it happen.

53:52.552 --> 53:53.787
Thank you, wise old us's.

53:53.853 --> 53:55.355
Yeah.

54:04.331 --> 54:07.535
I just wanna say
thank you, Bill,

54:07.601 --> 54:10.403
for all the times
you've been there for me.

54:11.972 --> 54:15.642
I feel like I never really
knew you, Ted.

54:15.708 --> 54:17.377
Oh.

54:17.445 --> 54:20.046
That's my fault.

54:20.112 --> 54:23.616
I never truly opened
myself up to you.

54:23.682 --> 54:28.322
The truth is, I looked at you
and saw myself.

54:29.121 --> 54:33.360
Yeah. I know. Me, too.

54:33.427 --> 54:38.666
I'm sorry for the times
I let you down, Bill.

54:38.731 --> 54:40.934
You never have, Bill.

54:41.735 --> 54:44.070
You never have.

54:53.547 --> 54:56.284
I'll never forget you, Bill.

54:56.650 --> 54:58.152
Ever.

55:00.653 --> 55:03.123
Catch you later, Ted.

55:09.463 --> 55:12.432
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.

55:19.672 --> 55:21.407
They're nice boys.

55:21.474 --> 55:23.110
Yeah.

55:23.943 --> 55:26.612
Dude! We got the actual
real song!

55:26.679 --> 55:28.214
Now alls we gotta do
is figure out

55:28.282 --> 55:29.916
how to unite
the whole world with it.

55:29.983 --> 55:31.285
And save reality.

55:31.351 --> 55:32.652
Yeah.

55:33.186 --> 55:34.655
- Dude!
- What?

55:34.722 --> 55:36.957
The booth is gone.

55:37.023 --> 55:38.391
What?

55:38.458 --> 55:39.925
Where did it go?

55:39.992 --> 55:43.297
I don't know. Let's go back
and ask those wise old us's.

55:43.362 --> 55:45.598
Yeah. I hope
we're still alive.

55:48.867 --> 55:50.436
Freeze, Preston/Logan.

55:50.503 --> 55:52.605
Oh, this is exactly
what we don't need right now.

55:52.672 --> 55:55.608
We can't. We gotta get back
to the present, like, now.

55:55.675 --> 55:57.878
Yeah. Look, we know
you were sent here

55:57.945 --> 55:59.446
to kill us if we didn't have
the song.

55:59.512 --> 56:03.351
But we actually do have
the song now, so...

56:03.951 --> 56:06.153
Wait. You have the song?

56:08.221 --> 56:09.757
Oh...

56:10.623 --> 56:12.259
Uh...

56:12.326 --> 56:14.661
Mistakes were made.

56:15.795 --> 56:17.463
Apologies are given.

56:17.530 --> 56:20.933
You're forgiven. No problem.
But we gotta go, robot dude.

56:21.001 --> 56:24.271
Wait! No, must expiate guilt.

56:24.338 --> 56:27.040
For what? We're fine, dude.
Let us go!

56:27.106 --> 56:30.043
For... murdering family.

56:30.110 --> 56:32.112
Wait. What?

56:32.179 --> 56:34.648
What are you talking about?

56:34.713 --> 56:38.018
I lasered your daughters.

56:38.085 --> 56:39.219
You lasered them?

56:39.286 --> 56:41.288
You lasered our daughters?

56:41.353 --> 56:42.955
Where are they?

56:43.023 --> 56:44.791
Daughters are...

56:45.458 --> 56:46.525
in Hell.

56:46.592 --> 56:49.362
You sent our daughters
to Hell?

56:52.099 --> 56:53.667
We have to go get them.

56:54.601 --> 56:56.170
Shoot us.

56:56.237 --> 56:59.706
I can't shoot you.
You have the song.

57:00.974 --> 57:02.442
Well, guess what?

57:02.509 --> 57:04.110
Now there's no song.

57:04.177 --> 57:06.679
Now you got
no choice, Robot.

57:06.746 --> 57:08.481
You gotta kill us!

57:18.525 --> 57:20.795
Can no longer take life.

57:21.161 --> 57:22.361
What?

57:22.429 --> 57:24.631
Failure. Failure.
Failure. Failure.

57:24.697 --> 57:27.734
Dude, we need this guy
to laser us

57:27.802 --> 57:29.036
but he appears to be having

57:29.101 --> 57:31.038
some kind of
nervous breakdown.

57:31.105 --> 57:34.039
Shoot us, Robot!

57:34.106 --> 57:35.442
I can't.
I'm a failure.

57:35.509 --> 57:37.211
I don't even deserve to live,
you know?

57:37.277 --> 57:38.311
Shoot us!

57:38.378 --> 57:40.146
Can't do it. Shoot myself.

57:40.213 --> 57:41.648
- Wait, don't!
- You can't!

57:41.715 --> 57:43.784
We gotta go
save Billie and Thea.

57:43.851 --> 57:45.719
- Let's do it!
- Yeah.

57:45.786 --> 57:49.021
I'm so sorry!
Goodbye, cruel world!

57:54.827 --> 57:55.963
It worked!

57:56.030 --> 57:57.531
Yeah!

58:01.867 --> 58:03.770
...world!

58:04.971 --> 58:06.206
That is unexpected.

58:06.273 --> 58:08.876
Yeah. How can a robot
even die?

58:08.942 --> 58:10.610
Let's find the girls.

58:11.210 --> 58:13.746
Can I come with you?

58:15.382 --> 58:16.883
He did kill us.

58:18.818 --> 58:20.488
Come on, Robot!

58:21.954 --> 58:23.891
Wait. I have a name.

58:24.692 --> 58:26.559
It's Dennis.

58:27.226 --> 58:28.862
Dennis McCoy.

58:28.929 --> 58:31.164
Okay. Let's go, Dennis McCoy.

58:31.231 --> 58:32.666
- Thea!
- Billie!

58:32.733 --> 58:35.836
Dennis Caleb McCoy.
That's the full name.

58:35.902 --> 58:38.271
Let's go, dude!

58:38.338 --> 58:41.208
I feel gratitude. Gratitude.

58:41.275 --> 58:42.608
Okay, we get it.

58:42.675 --> 58:44.277
You're a grateful,
totally insecure,

58:44.344 --> 58:47.780
somehow dead robot
named Dennis Caleb McCoy.

58:47.847 --> 58:50.217
- Thea!
- Billie!

58:51.483 --> 58:53.252
How're we gonna
find them, dude?

58:53.320 --> 58:54.454
I don't know, dude.

58:54.521 --> 58:57.224
Yeah, I don't even know, dude.

58:59.291 --> 59:02.496
Thea! Billie!

59:05.532 --> 59:07.233
Great Leader?

59:07.300 --> 59:10.171
Bill and Ted are dead.
Did it work?

59:13.672 --> 59:15.107
No.

59:15.175 --> 59:17.278
Nothing is working.

59:19.579 --> 59:20.813
Oh...

59:20.880 --> 59:23.384
They were very nice.
Very nice. Good group.

59:23.449 --> 59:25.985
- Group?
- Yeah. They went that way.

59:26.052 --> 59:27.487
Thanks, demons.

59:27.554 --> 59:28.822
- You betcha.
- Enjoy Hell, y'all.

59:28.889 --> 59:30.057
- Thanks, demons.
- Have a good time, boys.

59:30.123 --> 59:31.090
I know that's strange.

59:31.157 --> 59:32.259
What is that, a robot?

59:32.326 --> 59:34.461
Yeah, that's a robot in Hell.

59:34.527 --> 59:36.262
- Thea?
- Billie?

59:36.329 --> 59:38.731
- Thea?
- Billie!

59:38.797 --> 59:40.266
No!

59:40.333 --> 59:42.368
- Apology not accepted, Mother.
- Kelly?

59:42.434 --> 59:45.940
Ah! Bill and Ted are here.
Did it work, Mom?

59:46.673 --> 59:48.909
Yeah. That's what I thought.

59:48.974 --> 59:49.976
Where are they?

59:50.043 --> 59:51.778
They're that way.

59:53.380 --> 59:54.948
I'm Dennis Caleb McCoy.
I am so...

59:55.014 --> 59:57.616
No! No.

59:57.684 --> 01:00:00.353
Oh, yeah. This is way worse
than the Christmas incident.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.990
And you named him Dennis?
After my ex?

01:00:04.056 --> 01:00:05.792
Get outta here!

01:00:16.268 --> 01:00:18.638
- Thea! Billie!
- Billie! Thea!

01:00:18.706 --> 01:00:20.274
Dads!

01:00:24.878 --> 01:00:26.013
Dads!

01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:29.116
How're you doin'?

01:00:29.182 --> 01:00:30.951
Well, you know, we're dead.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.251
And we're in Hell.

01:00:32.318 --> 01:00:33.853
But how're you doin'?

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.988
We're good!

01:00:35.054 --> 01:00:36.923
Yeah. Look who we found.

01:00:37.623 --> 01:00:38.857
Dad?

01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:40.193
Hi, Ted.

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.196
I was wrong.
I mean, you're here.

01:00:43.262 --> 01:00:46.766
Which implies that you also
traveled through time

01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:50.537
and that your wives actually
are princesses.

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:53.205
All of which proves
that it is imperative

01:00:53.273 --> 01:00:54.875
that you write the song

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.476
that will
unite the entire world.

01:00:57.543 --> 01:00:59.945
And save reality.

01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:01.213
Wait, is that new?

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.983
Yeah.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:06.619
Well, then, I should help you
instead of criticizing you.

01:01:06.686 --> 01:01:11.057
And I am very,
very, very sorry.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:12.659
Thanks, Dad!

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.128
Yeah, thanks, Chief Logan!

01:01:15.195 --> 01:01:16.997
I wasn't talking to you, Bill.

01:01:17.063 --> 01:01:19.031
Oh. Cool.

01:01:19.099 --> 01:01:21.902
Well, Dads, this is the band
we put together for you.

01:01:21.967 --> 01:01:24.770
This is Jimi Hendrix,
Louis Armstrong...

01:01:24.838 --> 01:01:28.575
And Mozart,
and Ling Lun, and Grom.

01:01:29.443 --> 01:01:31.278
A pleasure, gentlemen.

01:01:31.344 --> 01:01:33.746
You raised
two fine young girls.

01:01:33.813 --> 01:01:35.449
- Thank you.
- And this is Kid Cudi

01:01:35.516 --> 01:01:37.384
who's not technically
a historical figure.

01:01:37.449 --> 01:01:39.519
- Kinda am now, I think.
- Yeah.

01:01:39.585 --> 01:01:41.721
It's a great honor
to meet you all.

01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:46.826
Yeah. Welcome to,
and sorry about, Hell.

01:01:46.893 --> 01:01:47.894
My bad.

01:01:50.697 --> 01:01:54.000
Oh.
That's Dennis Caleb McCoy.

01:01:54.067 --> 01:01:57.070
We've met. He killed us.

01:01:57.137 --> 01:01:59.005
I'm really sorry

01:01:59.072 --> 01:02:01.375
that I lasered you all.

01:02:01.442 --> 01:02:03.208
And...

01:02:03.275 --> 01:02:05.311
I just need to tell you...

01:02:05.378 --> 01:02:10.049
My name is
Dennis Caleb McCoy, and...

01:02:10.117 --> 01:02:12.119
Thank you, Dennis.

01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:14.221
Well, thanks for
coming to get us.

01:02:14.288 --> 01:02:15.387
How're we gonna
get outta here?

01:02:15.454 --> 01:02:16.923
We're gonna go talk to Death.

01:02:16.989 --> 01:02:19.892
Oh. Well, isn't he still mad
at you guys?

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.260
Oh, yeah.

01:02:21.327 --> 01:02:23.061
- And we're still mad at him.
- Yeah.

01:02:23.128 --> 01:02:24.563
Oh.

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.931
Nineteen minutes.

01:02:25.998 --> 01:02:27.734
Everyone, follow us.

01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:33.306
Yes way!

01:02:34.407 --> 01:02:37.943
Best 75 out of 81.

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.313
Is he playing Hopscotch
by himself?

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.581
I have
bested you again.

01:02:41.648 --> 01:02:44.117
He looks miserable, dude.

01:02:44.184 --> 01:02:46.119
Yes!

01:02:46.186 --> 01:02:47.420
Dude, he's cheating!

01:02:47.487 --> 01:02:48.956
Yes!

01:02:51.358 --> 01:02:52.993
- Take a hike.
- Let's go, dude.

01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:54.159
Good luck, Dads.

01:02:54.226 --> 01:02:55.194
- Be sweet.
- Okay.

01:02:55.262 --> 01:02:56.764
Okay.

01:03:01.034 --> 01:03:02.769
Hey, Death.

01:03:03.835 --> 01:03:06.973
Why, if it isn't
the Wyld Stallyns.

01:03:08.307 --> 01:03:10.177
Have you come to sue me again?

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:12.045
No, Death. Not at all.

01:03:12.112 --> 01:03:14.715
No. We just need
to talk to you, Death.

01:03:15.215 --> 01:03:17.584
Talk to the hand.

01:03:18.918 --> 01:03:21.054
It will only take
a second, dude.

01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:24.191
- Death!
- Come on, dude.

01:03:28.527 --> 01:03:29.628
Who is it?

01:03:29.695 --> 01:03:31.632
Bill and Ted!

01:03:31.697 --> 01:03:35.467
What? Did your
restraining order run out?

01:03:35.534 --> 01:03:37.503
Did the judge change his mind?

01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:41.106
So, now I am allowed
to get close to you? Hmm?

01:03:41.173 --> 01:03:42.208
Is this too close?

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:43.542
Death.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.746
We didn't want to sue you,
dude.

01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:48.882
- Remember, be sweet, dude.
- You're right.

01:03:48.947 --> 01:03:52.684
You tried to take the name
Wyld Stallyns.

01:03:52.751 --> 01:03:54.721
I was Wyld Stallyns.

01:03:54.788 --> 01:03:56.255
What are you talking about?

01:03:56.322 --> 01:03:58.990
You kicked me out
because you was jealous of me.

01:03:59.057 --> 01:04:00.726
- No, no, no, dude.
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:02.695
You quit the band
to go out on your own!

01:04:02.762 --> 01:04:04.264
You wouldn't let me play!

01:04:04.331 --> 01:04:07.266
Dude, you were playing
40-minute bass solos.

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:08.701
No one but you could play!

01:04:08.768 --> 01:04:11.304
I was in the groove!

01:04:11.371 --> 01:04:13.773
- What?
- Those 40-minute solos,

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.009
that was the highlight
of your shows.

01:04:17.077 --> 01:04:20.747
It's no wonder
you went down in the tubes.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:26.586
What're we gonna do?

01:04:27.286 --> 01:04:28.788
Oh...

01:04:28.855 --> 01:04:30.824
Death, the reason
we came here is 'cause

01:04:30.891 --> 01:04:32.659
we have to play a song
at some place

01:04:32.726 --> 01:04:33.793
called MP 46,

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.662
- like, right now.
- Hmm.

01:04:35.728 --> 01:04:39.364
All of time is gonna fold
in on itself, dude.

01:04:39.431 --> 01:04:42.001
I have been demoted down here

01:04:42.068 --> 01:04:46.405
because I took two so-called
"friends" back up

01:04:46.472 --> 01:04:48.641
who should not have gone
back up.

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:50.742
So, if that is why
you're here...

01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:54.081
Sorry, not sorry.

01:04:54.947 --> 01:04:56.250
Bye!

01:04:57.483 --> 01:04:59.653
- What now?
- I don't know, dude.

01:04:59.719 --> 01:05:01.820
Dads, we have an idea.

01:05:01.887 --> 01:05:03.556
You mind if we try?

01:05:03.623 --> 01:05:05.057
I mean, the dude is the most
rad bass player, like, ever.

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.592
Yeah.

01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:09.229
Please.

01:05:09.295 --> 01:05:11.030
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:05:11.097 --> 01:05:13.300
- All right.
- He's kind of a dick.

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:15.068
Okay.

01:05:23.775 --> 01:05:27.880
Dads, we think
you should wait outside.

01:05:44.998 --> 01:05:47.367
- Oh.
- Excuse us, Mr. Death, sir.

01:05:47.434 --> 01:05:49.403
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Death, sir.

01:05:49.469 --> 01:05:52.704
Well, if it isn't Little Bill
and Little Ted.

01:05:52.771 --> 01:05:55.208
We're still your hugest fans.

01:05:55.275 --> 01:05:56.610
Yeah.

01:05:57.744 --> 01:05:59.612
Don't fudge with me.

01:05:59.679 --> 01:06:00.913
We're not fudging
with you, sir.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.581
- It's legit.
- Yeah.

01:06:02.648 --> 01:06:03.817
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:03.884 --> 01:06:05.184
I mean, <i>The Lonely Soul Surfer</i>

01:06:05.251 --> 01:06:08.188
was the most underrated album
in 1998.

01:06:08.253 --> 01:06:09.855
The critics hated it.

01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:11.157
Well, they just weren't ready

01:06:11.224 --> 01:06:12.792
for an album
that was all bass.

01:06:12.858 --> 01:06:15.929
"It was all over the place,"
they said.

01:06:15.994 --> 01:06:20.365
"It was a raging,
confused mess," they said.

01:06:20.432 --> 01:06:25.471
"It was even worse than
<i>Pale on Pale,"</i> they said.

01:06:25.538 --> 01:06:27.574
Well...

01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:30.876
It was, in parts.

01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:32.579
But in other parts...

01:06:32.646 --> 01:06:34.314
The outro
in <i>I'll Never Be Loved</i>

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.982
is the most bodacious.

01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:38.618
I mean, the last three bars

01:06:38.684 --> 01:06:41.188
before the chorus
in <i>Too Pale to Cry...</i>

01:06:41.253 --> 01:06:43.089
Oh, well...

01:06:43.155 --> 01:06:47.960
What did you think of the hook
in <i>Boogie Down With Doctor D?</i>

01:06:48.027 --> 01:06:49.961
What can we even say?

01:06:50.028 --> 01:06:53.565
Insane. We've never seen
left-hand technique like that.

01:06:53.632 --> 01:06:56.402
I know! I was self-taught.

01:06:56.469 --> 01:07:00.173
You have some crazy,
crazy skills, dude!

01:07:00.239 --> 01:07:02.708
Well...

01:07:02.775 --> 01:07:04.877
- You know what you need?
- Hmm?

01:07:05.945 --> 01:07:08.514
You just need a band.

01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:10.250
And the band needs you.

01:07:12.251 --> 01:07:13.253
Oh.

01:07:13.318 --> 01:07:15.188
- T?
- B.

01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:20.860
Come on in.

01:07:21.762 --> 01:07:23.329
Dads,

01:07:23.396 --> 01:07:26.432
is there something you would
like to say to Death?

01:07:26.498 --> 01:07:29.702
Oh...

01:07:41.114 --> 01:07:45.150
We're sorry for how things
went between us, Death.

01:07:45.217 --> 01:07:46.518
Yeah.

01:07:46.585 --> 01:07:48.387
Sincerely sorry.

01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:55.295
I am sorry that fame
went to my head.

01:07:56.563 --> 01:07:59.132
It's very intoxicating.

01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:04.036
We really did love playing
with you, dude.

01:08:04.938 --> 01:08:07.239
We really did rock, didn't we?

01:08:07.306 --> 01:08:09.909
We definitely did.

01:08:09.976 --> 01:08:12.412
And if it's not too late,
Death...

01:08:12.478 --> 01:08:13.812
Yeah?

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.582
Would you
consider rejoining...

01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:20.752
Wyld Stallyns?

01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:24.191
Oh... I...

01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:33.600
I suppose.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:51.450
Okay, let's go!

01:08:51.515 --> 01:08:53.818
Right. Right.

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:01.094
It's Dennis. Hi.

01:09:03.996 --> 01:09:05.662
- I got lost.
- Get in, Dennis.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:07.899
Okay.
Thank you, guys.

01:09:07.966 --> 01:09:09.533
- Hey, Kid Cudi.
- Hey, Dennis.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.037
Oh, hello. Hello, everyone.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:13.506
Hey. Hey. Yeah, okay, friends.

01:09:13.573 --> 01:09:15.742
Let's rock!

01:09:23.216 --> 01:09:26.719
It was cool
when you said, "Let's rock,"

01:09:26.786 --> 01:09:29.453
because it made me
want to rock.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.055
Uh-huh.

01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:33.658
You don't just get to rock.

01:09:33.725 --> 01:09:36.828
You got to earn the right
to rock.

01:09:36.895 --> 01:09:40.532
Dude! We got 11 minutes.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.801
Anyone know where MP 46 is?

01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:44.304
Depends on your perspective.

01:09:44.371 --> 01:09:46.270
To really dig the groove
of the quantum realm,

01:09:46.337 --> 01:09:48.340
you gotta choose a place
to dig it from.

01:09:48.407 --> 01:09:49.841
Dig?

01:09:51.176 --> 01:09:53.947
Anyone know where MP 46 is?

01:10:00.286 --> 01:10:02.288
We're never gonna
make our flight.

01:10:07.993 --> 01:10:10.662
Deac, Deac.
Look at that.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.536
Whoa!

01:10:17.002 --> 01:10:18.505
I got this.

01:10:19.773 --> 01:10:21.274
Stop!

01:10:25.712 --> 01:10:27.447
We're back!

01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:28.949
What?

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:32.885
This is bad.

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:37.056
Really bad.

01:10:37.823 --> 01:10:40.226
Okay, guys, let's go!

01:10:42.795 --> 01:10:44.396
Come on!

01:10:44.463 --> 01:10:46.131
Come on, Mozart.

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:49.734
Oh, Ted! Even if we knew

01:10:49.801 --> 01:10:51.237
where we were
supposed to play,

01:10:51.304 --> 01:10:53.773
there's no way
we'd ever get there in time.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.842
Bill, look!

01:10:55.908 --> 01:10:58.310
This is MP 46?
It makes no sense.

01:10:58.377 --> 01:11:00.913
How can the song happen
right here?

01:11:01.881 --> 01:11:04.618
Because this is where
it happened.

01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:06.485
Ted, you're right, dude!

01:11:06.552 --> 01:11:09.956
But, dude,
what're we gonna play?

01:11:10.856 --> 01:11:12.591
I don't know, dude.

01:11:16.194 --> 01:11:19.164
Uh, Bill and Ted?
I saved these.

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.000
I'm not sure if...

01:11:21.067 --> 01:11:23.336
they're of any use, but...

01:11:23.402 --> 01:11:25.538
- Thanks, Dennis.
- Dads!

01:11:25.604 --> 01:11:27.606
Dads! MP 46.

01:11:27.673 --> 01:11:29.007
And the band is ready to play.

01:11:29.073 --> 01:11:31.577
Alls we need is the song.

01:11:36.815 --> 01:11:38.516
Thea.

01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:39.918
Billie.

01:11:39.985 --> 01:11:43.288
We don't know
how to tell you this.

01:11:43.355 --> 01:11:45.992
We don't have the song.

01:11:47.025 --> 01:11:48.394
Wait...

01:11:48.795 --> 01:11:50.396
You don't?

01:11:51.997 --> 01:11:53.698
No.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.568
We're sorry.

01:11:55.635 --> 01:11:57.470
We're sorry, Dads.

01:11:57.536 --> 01:12:00.506
Yeah, we really wanted to
help you out with this.

01:12:05.478 --> 01:12:08.515
Dude, you seeing
what I'm seeing?

01:12:12.717 --> 01:12:14.253
Preston?

01:12:14.753 --> 01:12:16.355
Logan?

01:12:18.623 --> 01:12:21.193
Preston/Logan.

01:12:22.695 --> 01:12:24.463
Whoa.

01:12:25.331 --> 01:12:27.634
What is it, Dads?

01:12:27.699 --> 01:12:29.469
It's you!

01:12:29.536 --> 01:12:30.869
What?

01:12:30.936 --> 01:12:33.939
It was you the whole time.
We just didn't see it.

01:12:34.006 --> 01:12:35.274
We can't write music.

01:12:35.341 --> 01:12:37.743
Whatever...
We just listen to stuff.

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:39.212
From things we like.

01:12:39.278 --> 01:12:40.546
And we just kind of
put stuff together.

01:12:40.613 --> 01:12:42.148
Yeah, maybe you just
listen a little,

01:12:42.213 --> 01:12:43.716
make things you like.

01:12:43.783 --> 01:12:45.484
And put it all together.

01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:48.854
Girls, you're not here
to back us.

01:12:48.921 --> 01:12:51.758
We're here to back you.

01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:53.659
We're your band.

01:12:54.726 --> 01:12:56.095
Whoa.

01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:01.333
Follow us!

01:13:05.203 --> 01:13:06.805
Here you go. Instruments!

01:13:06.872 --> 01:13:08.373
Wow!

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.577
Dude, I just thought
of something.

01:13:11.644 --> 01:13:12.945
What is it, Ted?

01:13:13.011 --> 01:13:15.447
How is just listening
to a song...

01:13:15.515 --> 01:13:17.850
...gonna unite
the whole world...

01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:20.086
...throughout all of time?

01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:23.323
That is a good question, dude.

01:13:27.527 --> 01:13:29.662
It's almost like
they'd all have to hear it

01:13:29.729 --> 01:13:31.264
in order to play it.

01:13:31.331 --> 01:13:33.231
Ted, of course! That's how
we're gonna unite 'em.

01:13:33.297 --> 01:13:34.733
We get 'em to play along.

01:13:34.801 --> 01:13:36.336
Well, if that's true,
alls we gotta do is

01:13:36.403 --> 01:13:37.737
get to everyone
throughout all time.

01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:40.072
Yeah, and get 'em instruments,
dude.

01:13:40.139 --> 01:13:42.740
In seven minutes
and 25 seconds.

01:13:42.807 --> 01:13:44.275
What about a tambourine?

01:13:44.342 --> 01:13:46.311
I mean, how hard can it be
to rock with that?

01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:49.515
Tambourine is not as easy
as it looks.

01:13:49.582 --> 01:13:52.419
What about dancing?
I'm a very gifted dancer.

01:13:52.484 --> 01:13:53.985
You dance?

01:13:54.052 --> 01:13:55.621
- Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

01:13:55.688 --> 01:13:59.792
Why don't you go over there
and rehearse your dance?

01:14:00.092 --> 01:14:01.528
Okay.

01:14:02.328 --> 01:14:03.762
Dude, we have no power!

01:14:03.828 --> 01:14:05.030
Say no more. On it.

01:14:05.097 --> 01:14:06.364
Okay.

01:14:20.712 --> 01:14:22.247
There! Oh, Jo.

01:14:22.314 --> 01:14:23.815
- Theodore.
- William!

01:14:23.882 --> 01:14:25.016
- Joanna!
- Liz!

01:14:25.083 --> 01:14:26.885
Hi.

01:14:26.952 --> 01:14:29.789
Did you find a reality where
we're all happy together?

01:14:29.855 --> 01:14:31.222
We did.

01:14:31.289 --> 01:14:34.594
We realized we're happiest
in this reality.

01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:36.296
Sweet!

01:14:39.231 --> 01:14:41.533
Now, um, did we hear you say
something about

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.537
distributing instruments
all throughout time?

01:14:44.604 --> 01:14:45.637
Ready, T?

01:14:45.703 --> 01:14:48.541
Five, six,
five, six, seven, eight!

01:14:54.412 --> 01:14:57.382
Oh, my God, what's happening?

01:14:58.015 --> 01:14:59.618
Excuse me, Mr. Cudi, sir?

01:14:59.685 --> 01:15:01.921
Our wives just traveled
through multiple realities.

01:15:01.987 --> 01:15:03.256
And in doing so,
they realized...

01:15:03.322 --> 01:15:04.457
They're all happening

01:15:04.523 --> 01:15:05.757
- simultaneously.
- Simultaneously.

01:15:05.824 --> 01:15:07.359
Do we need individual us's

01:15:07.426 --> 01:15:09.595
to take instruments
to infinite places?

01:15:09.662 --> 01:15:13.032
Okay. See, contrary to what
some have argued,

01:15:13.099 --> 01:15:14.801
universal wave function is,

01:15:14.868 --> 01:15:16.302
epistemologically speaking,

01:15:16.368 --> 01:15:17.769
both cyclic and separating.
In other words...

01:15:17.836 --> 01:15:19.771
Excuse me, Kid Cudi.
I don't mean to be rude,

01:15:19.838 --> 01:15:22.341
but we have, like,
four and a half minutes.

01:15:23.676 --> 01:15:28.180
Madam. Madam! We have to go.
It's not safe to be in here.

01:15:28.247 --> 01:15:30.950
Where were you thinking
of going?

01:15:45.965 --> 01:15:47.833
I think it's a lunar eclipse.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.902
That is not lunar, you guys.

01:15:55.239 --> 01:15:57.208
This is a disaster, T.

01:15:57.275 --> 01:15:59.043
What are we gonna do, B?

01:16:06.051 --> 01:16:07.987
Stop!

01:16:08.054 --> 01:16:10.823
All you need to do is go
in the quantum superposition

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:12.057
with multiple realities.

01:16:12.123 --> 01:16:13.858
But how?

01:16:13.926 --> 01:16:16.162
Dudes, the booth is obviously
a tunnel to the quantum realm.

01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:17.695
Go, go, go!

01:16:17.762 --> 01:16:19.564
- Thank you, Mr. Cudi!
- Thank you, Mr. Cudi!

01:16:19.631 --> 01:16:20.865
Station.

01:16:20.932 --> 01:16:22.234
Station!

01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:24.304
- Grom!
- Grom, you start!

01:16:25.337 --> 01:16:27.239
- No, no, no...
- Stop, stop!

01:16:27.306 --> 01:16:28.807
Here.

01:16:35.314 --> 01:16:37.717
And now, Death!

01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:41.153
Well... It's...
Maybe something like...

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.387
<i>Too Pale to Cry.</i>

01:16:42.453 --> 01:16:44.724
- That last riff?
- Amazing!

01:16:46.925 --> 01:16:48.494
Yeah.

01:16:53.865 --> 01:16:56.635
What're we gonna tell
people to play?

01:16:57.435 --> 01:16:59.505
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:02.342
Read me the number
for the infinite, dude.

01:17:04.277 --> 01:17:05.411
Six-nine...

01:17:05.478 --> 01:17:06.712
Six-nine...

01:17:06.779 --> 01:17:08.014
Two-nine-nine...

01:17:08.081 --> 01:17:09.882
- How about that concerto?
- Okay, go tell him.

01:17:09.948 --> 01:17:11.384
Mozart.

01:17:14.686 --> 01:17:16.488
Three-four-five-five...

01:17:16.555 --> 01:17:19.525
Five-one-zero-one...

01:17:19.591 --> 01:17:21.192
I already said goodbye
to the girls.

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:22.962
But I wanna stay here
and dance.

01:17:23.029 --> 01:17:24.897
Dennis.

01:17:24.963 --> 01:17:27.032
Good luck,
my excellent friends.

01:17:27.099 --> 01:17:28.801
Thanks, Kelly.

01:17:28.868 --> 01:17:30.136
Later, Dennis.

01:17:30.203 --> 01:17:32.839
My name is Dennis.
Dennis McCoy.

01:17:33.972 --> 01:17:35.440
Two-one-eight.

01:17:35.507 --> 01:17:38.944
Faster, you know?
Yeah! Now, D.

01:17:39.011 --> 01:17:40.579
Oh, yeah.

01:17:41.279 --> 01:17:43.248
Yeah!

01:17:43.315 --> 01:17:45.318
Watch this!

01:17:50.889 --> 01:17:53.359
Jimi, for the win!

01:17:55.193 --> 01:17:56.529
One-eight-two-eight...

01:17:56.595 --> 01:17:57.996
Okay. Okay.
The girls said C major.

01:17:58.064 --> 01:18:00.032
One-hundred thirteen
beats per minute.

01:18:00.099 --> 01:18:02.702
- Got it.
- All right. Yeah.

01:18:02.769 --> 01:18:05.570
Four-five-five. Five-one...

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.855
- Four-three-five...
- Guys, maybe just press

01:18:23.922 --> 01:18:24.923
the infinite button.

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:26.324
Oh, yeah.

01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:28.360
Yeah.

01:18:33.097 --> 01:18:34.367
One last thing.

01:18:34.432 --> 01:18:36.935
I love you, Elizabeth.

01:18:37.002 --> 01:18:38.737
I love you, Joanna.

01:18:38.804 --> 01:18:40.073
We know.

01:18:41.439 --> 01:18:43.741
I love you.

01:18:43.809 --> 01:18:46.445
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

01:19:12.003 --> 01:19:13.939
- How's it goin', Deac?
- Whoa!

01:19:14.006 --> 01:19:15.641
- Missy.
- Oh!

01:19:15.707 --> 01:19:18.543
In case you're wondering,
I'm essentially an infinite me.

01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:19.944
Catch you later.

01:19:20.011 --> 01:19:22.081
Outstanding!

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:32.591
Yeah!

01:19:47.639 --> 01:19:49.775
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

01:19:52.645 --> 01:19:54.781
Dads!

01:20:05.024 --> 01:20:06.492
Wait.

01:20:12.698 --> 01:20:15.902
San Dimas, make some noise!

01:20:26.244 --> 01:20:27.846
Yeah!

01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:32.285
Ten, nine...

01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:34.252
eight, seven...

01:20:34.319 --> 01:20:35.653
six...

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.922
- five...
- Dads!

01:20:37.989 --> 01:20:39.291
...four, three...

01:20:39.358 --> 01:20:41.726
two, one.

01:20:51.837 --> 01:20:54.507
Madam, you need to see this.

01:20:59.912 --> 01:21:02.981
Your father would be
so proud of you.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.661
Wow.

01:21:15.728 --> 01:21:16.895
- Bye!
- Bye, Kid Cudi!

01:21:16.962 --> 01:21:18.931
- Bye!
- See ya, Kid Cudi!

01:21:54.033 --> 01:21:55.234
It's working!

01:21:55.301 --> 01:21:56.802
Yeah!

01:22:17.989 --> 01:22:19.625
<i>And so,
it wasn't so much</i>

01:22:19.692 --> 01:22:21.259
<i>the song
that made the difference.</i>

01:22:21.326 --> 01:22:24.697
<i>It was everyone
playing it together.</i>

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:27.867
<i>And it worked.</i>

01:29:38.697 --> 01:29:40.765
Dude...

01:29:40.832 --> 01:29:44.969
are you dead yet?

01:29:45.036 --> 01:29:47.072
No.

01:29:50.375 --> 01:29:52.444
Are you?

01:29:53.845 --> 01:29:55.981
No.

01:29:56.047 --> 01:30:02.186
There's one more thing
we need to do

01:30:02.253 --> 01:30:04.422
before we go.

01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:07.693
Definitely.

01:30:20.104 --> 01:30:21.605
Ready, Bill?

01:30:21.672 --> 01:30:23.474
Ready, Ted.

01:30:23.908 --> 01:30:25.342
- One...
- Two...

01:30:25.409 --> 01:30:28.546
One, two, three, four!

01:30:56.475 --> 01:30:57.976
Okay.

01:30:58.042 --> 01:30:59.676
Yeah. Okay.

01:30:59.743 --> 01:31:02.113
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:31:15.493 --> 01:31:18.329
- We still got it.
- We still got it.

01:31:18.395 --> 01:31:20.798
- Hey, Bill.
- Yeah?

01:31:27.904 --> 01:31:30.141
Okay, I have to sit down.

01:31:30.908 --> 01:31:32.677
I'm sorry.

01:31:33.578 --> 01:31:35.881
- That was fun.
- That was good.

01:31:40.685 --> 01:31:42.353
Nurse!
