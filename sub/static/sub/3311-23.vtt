WEBVTT

00:06.140 --> 00:09.043
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.045
( TV chatter )

00:11.079 --> 00:13.013
GEORGE, NOT THE
NECK, NOT THE NECK.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.683
I'M SORRY, DID YOU WANT MORE NECK?
COMING RIGHT UP.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.585
( giggles ) NO.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.088
OH LOOK. THE MOVIE'S OVER.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.090
WE MISSED THE ENDING.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.092
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.061
I WANT TO MAKE SURE NO ANIMALS
WERE HARMED DURING THE FILMING.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.698
ALL RIGHT, NO ONE DIED.
LET'S GET NAKED.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.067
OH, NOT TONIGHT, COWBOY.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.669
I GOTTA WORK IN THE MORNING.
IT'S TIME FOR BED.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.671
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING...
BEDTIME.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.673
NO NO NO, MY BED HERE,
YOUR BED THERE.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.110
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU
JUST EXPLAIN IT TO ME UPSTAIRS?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.712
( cell phone rings )

00:44.745 --> 00:46.780
- HELLO.
- Man: Hey George.

00:46.814 --> 00:50.151
HEY STEVERS. HEY, MAN, I CAN'T
HEAR YOU OVER THE MUSIC.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.720
OH, DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE ENVY LOUNGE?

00:52.753 --> 00:56.624
WANT TO? YEAH. GOING TO? NO.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.160
THE OLD LADY'S GOTTA WORK.
I'M COMING SOLO.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.761
AWW.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.763
I'M YOUR OLD LADY?
THAT'S SO SWEET.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.666
NEVER SAY THAT AGAIN.

01:08.102 --> 01:11.139
OH, LOOK AT HIM GO...
YOUNG, INDEPENDENT,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.674
NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.777
THIS CRAP'S GOTTA STOP.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.112
THAT BOY NEEDS A JOB.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.080
I MEAN, YEAH, IT STARTED
OFF AS A FLING,

01:20.114 --> 01:22.082
BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP'S
GETTING SERIOUS.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.685
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE I'M LOOKING
AT YOU DOESN'T MEAN I'M LISTENING.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.621
OH, COME ON, JOE. YOU SAID
YOU LIKED HIS BUSINESS IDEA.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.790
SO GIVE HIM SOME POINTERS...
YOU KNOW, BUSINESSY THINGS.

01:29.823 --> 01:34.662
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE, 'CAUSE I WAS
FIRST IN MY CLASS AT BUSINESSY SCHOOL.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.165
IT'S NOT THAT EASY, BURKE. A COUPLE
OF WEEKS AGO WHEN GEORGE AND I

01:37.198 --> 01:40.601
WENT OVER HIS LITTLE ECO-FRIENDLY FABRIC
THING, THE KID WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.136
YEAH, BUT THAT'S JUST
HIS YOUTHFUL ENERGY.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.138
COME ON, JOE, HE NEEDS
SOMEONE LIKE YOU

01:44.172 --> 01:46.140
WHO'S SEASONED AND
WISE, YOU KNOW.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.609
BE HIS OBI WAN. BE
HIS OPRAH, JOE.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.711
BE HIS JOPRAH.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.846
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NOPRAH.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.116
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU WANT ME TO TURN

01:56.150 --> 01:58.719
YOUR BOY WONDER INTO A MAN
WONDER, GROW HIM UP FOR YOU.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.854
IT'S WHAT HE'D EVOLVE INTO ANYWAY.
AND YOU CAN HELP HIM.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.657
AND BY HELPING HIM YOU'RE HELPING ME AND
BY HELPING ME YOU'RE HELPING YOURSELF.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.693
IT'S REALLY A CIRCLE OF HELP.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.862
I KNOW THE CIRCLE OF HELP. IT'S GONNA
COME AROUND AND BITE ME ON THE ASS.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.098

03:12.860 --> 03:14.662

03:14.695 --> 03:18.732

03:21.669 --> 03:22.770
YES.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.805
YOGURT-COVERED PRETZELS.
MY MOTHER LOVES THEM.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.907
OKAY, GREAT.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.175

03:28.208 --> 03:30.844
YOU'RE MEETING MY
PARENTS ON FRIDAY.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.181
YEAH, OF COURSE, RIGHT.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.916
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.920
UGH, GET YOUR ARM OFF ME.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.693
SO LOOK, MAN, GOOD
WORK HERE.ALLY

03:45.726 --> 03:48.829

03:48.862 --> 03:50.831
40% LESS, YES.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.834
LOOK, I WANT YOU TO READ
ARTICLES TONIGHT, OKAY?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.703
OH MAN. HOMEWORK?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.871
YEAH, BUDDY. A PARTY SCHOOL.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.841
AND YOUR BASKETBALL TEAM BLOWS.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.777
LISTEN,

04:03.811 --> 04:06.680
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING
OFF TOPIC ABOUT MEL?

04:06.714 --> 04:08.716
RUN. I'M KIDDING.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.951
SEMI-KIDDING. WHAT?

04:10.984 --> 04:13.854
TUESDAY MEL AND I FOR
A WHOLE MONTHGETHER

04:13.887 --> 04:15.823
AND I WANT TO GET HER
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.991
WELL, LET'S SEE.
NORMALLY GIVE SOMEBODY

04:18.025 --> 04:19.993
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN
TOGETHER A WHOLE MONTH?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.929
AN INFLATABLE NECK PILLOW.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.931
THIS IS SERIOUS.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.900
IT'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
"I'M IN THIS FOR REAL."

04:26.934 --> 04:28.802
DO YOU THINK SHE'D LIKE
A CASHMERE SWEATER?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.738
NOPE NOPE. SHE'S
ALLERGIC TO WOOL

04:30.771 --> 04:33.674
AND ANGORA... OH,
AND CHEAP SHOES.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.809
I CAN GET HER AN APPOINTMENT
AT AN ALLERGIST.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.010
WHAT?

04:37.044 --> 04:40.614
WHAT IF I NAME A STAR AFTER HER?

04:40.648 --> 04:41.815
OKAY, THAT'S HILARIOUS.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.851
A BUDDY OF MINE ONCE GAVE
HIS GIRLFRIEND ONE OF THOSE

04:43.884 --> 04:45.853
FOR HER BIRTHDAY. OH
GOD, THAT POOR BA...

04:45.886 --> 04:47.855
MY POINT IS THAT

04:47.888 --> 04:49.957
SHE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE GIFTS
THAT ARE NOT FROM THIS GALAXY.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.892
PLUS SHE LIKES TO UNWRAP THINGS.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.695
WELL, I GOT MY MOM A
SILVER LOCKET ONCE.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.764
YOU THINK MEL WOULD LIKE THAT?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.833
GEORGE, YOU NEVER EVER
GIVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND

04:59.867 --> 05:02.636
THE SAME GIFT YOU JUST GAVE
YOUR MOTHER, ALL RIGHT?

05:02.670 --> 05:03.971
IT'S JUST KIND OF A
GOOD RULE TO LIVE BY.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.907
WELL, THEN I'M TAPPED.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.976
NO NO, WAIT A MINUTE. SHE
DOES LIKE JEWELRY THOUGH.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.679
YOU'VE SEEN HER DRESSER. SHE'S
GOT ALL OF HER NECKLACES

05:11.712 --> 05:13.881
KNOTTED UP THERE LIKE SPAGHETTI.
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.717
WHY DON'T YOU GET HER A JEWELRY BOX?
THAT'D BE A GOOD IDEA.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.753
YOU CAN EVEN PICK ONE OUT THAT PLAYS MUSIC.
YOU COULD PICK THE SONG.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.789
YEAH, I COULD PICK
HER FAVORITE SONG.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.892
WHAT IS HER FAVORITE SONG?

05:24.925 --> 05:26.894
DON'T YOU GUYS EVER TALK?

05:26.927 --> 05:29.663
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER?

05:29.697 --> 05:30.864
NEVER MIND.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.866
THE SONG IS "CARELESS LOVE."

05:32.900 --> 05:36.003
THANKS, MAN. I WILL
JUST GOOGLE THAT.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.971
OH, WHATCHA GOOGLING?

05:38.005 --> 05:40.708
PORN. BUSINESS PORN.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.710
INTERESTING, GEORGE.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.812
YOU'LL HAVE TO SHOW ME LATER.
WE CAN HAVE A STUDY DATE.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.814
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU
MAJORED IN HOTNESS.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.882
- AND MINORED IN NAUGHTY.
- OOH.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.954
REMEMBER, WE EAT OFF THIS TABLE.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.794
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS IS NOT
JUST MEETING REGULAR PARENTS.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.797
HOLLY'S FATHER'S A GYM TEACHER
AND ALL GYM TEACHERS HATE ME.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.833
AND HER MOTHER'S THE
CITY PROSECUTOR.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.636
SHE MAKES MURDERERS CRY.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.671
( laughs )

06:10.704 --> 06:11.972
I'M SORRY TO LAUGH.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.841
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME OUT

06:13.874 --> 06:15.976
OR ELSE FRIDAY'S DINNER
IS GONNA BE MY LAST MEAL.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.845
CALM DOWN.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.780
YOU'VE GOT A LOT GOING FOR YOU.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.916
YOU'RE WEAK AND TOTALLY UNTHREATENING.
PARENTS EAT THAT STUFF UP.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.653
THANKS. YOU'RE A
TERRIFIC LIFE COACH.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.888
LOOK, GETTING ALONG WITH PARENTS

06:27.921 --> 06:29.957
IS JUST A MATTER OF
MAKING THEM THINK

06:29.990 --> 06:32.025
YOU'RE SOMETHING GIRLS
ARE NOT INTERESTED IN.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.862
AND YOU'RE THERE.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.864
OKAY, I'M SORRY. THAT
WAS THE LAST ONE.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.999
ALL RIGHT, FOR REAL,

06:39.032 --> 06:41.669
DRESS CONSERVATIVE,

06:41.702 --> 06:43.737
SAY "YES SIR" AND "YES MA'AM."

06:43.771 --> 06:45.839
AND IF THEY ASK
ABOUT FUTURE PLANS,

06:45.873 --> 06:48.776
TELL THEM YOU WANT TO BE

06:48.809 --> 06:50.744
A FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.914
( doorbell rings )

06:53.947 --> 06:56.717
I GOT IT. IT'S GEORGE. HE'S TAKING
ME TO HIS FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.920
THE ONE WHERE THEY GIVE YOU THE
PAPER CROWN IF IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

06:59.953 --> 07:02.990
HEY, I'M SORRY I'M LATE, MEL, BUT
THERE'S A REALLY REALLY GOOD REASON.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.858
TELL ME ON THE WAY.
MUST HAVE WINE.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.828
NO NO NO, I THINK JOE
NEEDS TO HEAR THIS TOO.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.664
I GOT A CALL FROM ONE OF THE
COMPANIES THAT YOU SET ME UP WITH...

07:10.698 --> 07:13.767
FABRIZIO SPORTSWEAR. THEY WANT
TO MANUFACTURE MY FABRIC.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.869
THEY'RE FLYING ME TO ITALY
SOMETIME THIS WEEK.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.705
GEORGE, THAT'S AWESOME.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.873
DUDE. CONGRATS, BUDDY. I DID IT.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.942
I MEAN, YOU DID IT.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.845
THEIR EXECS WANT ME ON
THE FRONT LINE OF THIS.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.748
THEY MAY EVEN RENT ME
AN APARTMENT IN MILAN.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.750
WHOA, HEY, AN APARTMENT?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.919
LIKE THE THING PEOPLE LIVE IN?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.922
YEAH. I MEAN IT'LL BE
CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.691
OH, WELL, EXACTLY HOW
LONG IS THIS LONG RUN?

07:37.725 --> 07:39.827
I GET ALL THE DETAILS TOMORROW.
IT'S A BIG CONFERENCE CALL.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.896
I'M SORRY ABOUT DINNER, BUT I GOTTA
TURN THESE VISA PAPERS IN BEFORE 6:00.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.999
IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLE.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.736
HEY, THANKS, MAN. NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU.

07:48.769 --> 07:49.870
YOU GOT IT, BUDDY.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.007
WELL, LONGO COMES THROUGH AGAIN.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.944
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.980
I THINK I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.726
MILAN? ITALY? I ASKED
YOU TO HELP HIM,

08:12.760 --> 08:16.797
NOT MAKE HIM AN INTERNATIONAL
MAN OF FABRIC.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.600
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I DID
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO

08:19.633 --> 08:22.570
AND YOU'RE GIVING ME THE
WHO-FORGOT-TO-FLUSH FACE.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.607
FORGIVE ME. FORGIVE
ME FOR MAKING

08:26.640 --> 08:28.576
YOUR FRIEND'S DREAMS COME TRUE.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.578
I LIKED HIM AND HE LIKED ME.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.580
IT'S NOT EASY TO
FIND THE RIGHT GUY.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.914
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE THIS
RELATIONSHIP IS OVER, MEL.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.750
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY HARD TO
HOLD HIS HAND OR ANYTHING ELSE

08:36.784 --> 08:38.852
WHEN HE'S IN EUROPE.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.854
I THINK YOU'RE JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS HERE.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.757
HONESTLY, YOU'RE HAVING THIS
CONVERSATION WITH THE WRONG GUY.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.593
WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO GEORGE?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.662
BECAUSE I'M A-SCARED.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.835
REMEMBER, WHEN TALKING TO
HOLLY'S PARENTS, DON'T BRING UP

08:54.868 --> 08:57.638
POLITICS, WAR, SEX OR RELIGION.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.739
WHAT'S LEFT?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.674
JUSTIN BIEBER.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.811
OH, SO YOU'RE MEETING THE
GIRLFRIEND'S PARENTS TONIGHT?

09:03.844 --> 09:06.814
YIKES, I WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE YOU.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.686
I MEAN, I'M SURE
YOU'LL BE GREAT.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.854
YES, HE WILL BE.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.556
JUST CALM DOWN AND
REPEAT YOUR MANTRA.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.691
OH, WHAT'S YOUR MANTRA?

09:17.725 --> 09:21.662
I'M WEAK. I'M HARMLESS.
THEY LOVE ME.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.832
WHERE ARE MY
YOGURT-COVERED PRETZELS?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.667
THEY'RE IN THE BAG, SWEETIE.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.738
OH NO, I JUST PANICKED
ALL OVER THEM.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.673
WE HAVE BACKUPS IN THE KITCHEN.
COME ON.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.842
( doorbell rings )

09:37.911 --> 09:40.614
HEY, ARE YOU READY TO GO?
I MADE RESERVATIONS

09:40.648 --> 09:42.549
AT A SUPER QUIET RESTAURANT
SO WE COULD TALK.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.551
NO NO NO NO, WE
NEED TO TALK NOW.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.621
AH, YOU WANT TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT MILAN.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.623
YES, LIKE HOW LONG
YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE

09:49.657 --> 09:50.924
OR HOW SHORT YOU'RE
GONNA BE THERE.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.860
THEY JUST TOLD ME I'M
LEAVING THURSDAY,

09:52.893 --> 09:54.828
BUT THEY HAVEN'T WORKED
EVERYTHING OUT YET.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.597
OKAY, DON'T SUGAR-COAT IT.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.699
IT COULD BE SIX MONTHS.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.769
ALL RIGHT, SUGAR-COAT IT.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.637
IT COULD BE A YEAR.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.939
WOW, YOU SUCK AT
SUGAR-COATING IT.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.842
LOOK, I'M SORRY, MEL. THIS WHOLE
THING'S HAPPENING SO FAST.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.578
I'M REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU, GEORGE.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.881
I'M JUST NOT AS HAPPY FOR US.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.352
YOU KNOW WHAT? COME
TO ITALY WITH ME.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.354
- WHAT?
- YEAH, YOU LIKE SHOES.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.357
THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S SHAPED LIKE A BOOT.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT THERE.

10:24.391 --> 10:28.696
THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE EVERY TIME
YOU SAY ITALY, I THINK MARS.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.898
LOOK, GEORGE, MY ENTIRE
LIFE IS HERE, YOU KNOW.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.766
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO KIDS.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.602
I CAN'T JUST DROP
EVERYTHING AND TAKE OFF.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.604
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.606
I'LL FLY BACK ON
WEEKENDS HERE AND THERE.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.776
I CAN WORK ON THE PLANE...
INTERNET, FREE SNACKS, BLANKETS...

10:42.810 --> 10:45.846
COVERED WITH GERMS
FROM EVERY COUNTY.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.782
NO, I TRIED A LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP ONCE WITH BEN BRICKMAN.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.384
WE WERE PRACTICALLY MARRIED AND
THEN HE MOVED TO WOODHAVEN.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.888
- WERE YOU GUYS TOGETHER A LONG TIME?
- LIKE MOST OF FIFTH GRADE.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.357
AND THEN JUST POOF... GONE.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.826
LOOK AT ME, MEL.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.394
IS THIS THE FACE
OF BEN BRICKMAN?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.831
YEAH, KINDA.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.933
I HAVE A TYPE.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.935
LOOK, GEORGE, LET'S
BE REALISTIC.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.938
ITALY IS A MILLION MILES AWAY.
WE CAN'T COMMIT TO THIS.

11:10.971 --> 11:14.674
WE BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER. WE'VE
BEEN GOING OUT FOR WHAT, A MONTH?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.376
IT WILL BE TONIGHT.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.746
AND SPEAKING OF WHICH,

11:18.779 --> 11:20.914
HAPPY 30-DAY-VERSARY.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.950
WHAT'S THIS?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.719
WELL, IF I TELL YOU, I JUST
WASTED TWO HOURS WRAPPING IT.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.721
I LOVE UNWRAPPING STUFF.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.690
I KNEW THAT. THAT'S WHY
IT'S DOUBLE-WRAPPED.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.801
A JEWELRY BOX? IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.670
AH, BUT THERE'S MORE.
LIFT THE LID.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.439
( melody tinkling )

11:46.473 --> 11:49.376
"CARELESS LOVE"? MY DAD
USED TO SING THAT TO ME.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.378
THAT'S MY ALL-TIME
FAVORITE SONG.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.846
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.949
LET'S JUST SAY I PAY ATTENTION.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.851
I GUESS YOU DO.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.821
THIS IS SO ABSOLUTELY ME.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.956
I WASN'T EXPECTING
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.959
LOOK, AFTER THE FIRST
FEW TRIPS TO ITALY

12:05.993 --> 12:07.928
IT WON'T SEEM SO MARSLIKE, OKAY?

12:07.961 --> 12:10.931
WE CAN MAKE A LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP WORK. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.002
YES, A MILLION MILES OF YES.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.747
HOLLY WILL BE DOWN
IN JUST A MINUTE,

12:27.781 --> 12:31.418
WHICH WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO GET
TO KNOW YOU A BIT BETTER, RYDER.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.820
OH GOOD.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.755
SO YOU'RE IN OUR LITTLE
GIRL'S ENGLISH CLASS.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.759
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE WORDS
BEING TAKEN OUT OF "HUCK FINN"?

12:39.793 --> 12:42.863
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.764
I MEAN, I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.467
WHAT KIND OF ANSWER IS THAT?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.303
JUSTIN BIEBER.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.373
WELL, THIS IS SO NICE...

12:53.406 --> 12:55.542
EVERYONE HERE GETTING ALONG.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.547
IS THAT YOUR AWFUL
ARTICHOKE DIP?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.783
I TOLD YOU, MOTHER,
NEVER TO PUT THAT OUT.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.318
I'M SORRY, KITTEN.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.387
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE IT,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT AWAY.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.823
YOU TOLD ME TO PUT IT OUT.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.492
I SAID NO SUCH THING.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.364
DADDY, ARE YOU WEARING
THAT COLOGNE AGAIN?

13:17.397 --> 13:20.800
NO, I SWEAR. I THREW IT OUT.
THIS IS JUST SOAP.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.470
SO WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.772
SHRIMP SCAMPI. I
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.409
MOTHER, I HAD SHRIMP FOR LUNCH.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.379
( sighs ) FINE.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.848
I'LL JUST GO GET SOMETHING
OUT OF THE FREEZER.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.390
RYDER, WE HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.558
THANK YOU FOR GOING
OUT WITH HOLLY.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.528
SHE HAS BEEN SO MUCH SWEETER
SINCE SHE STARTED SEEING YOU.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.298
SUCH A PLEASURE TO
HAVE AROUND THE HOUSE.

13:51.331 --> 13:55.368
WE CALL YOU "THE
HOLLY WHISPERER."

13:55.402 --> 13:56.870
I'M JUST HER BOYFRIEND.

13:56.904 --> 14:00.307
YOU'RE JUST HER BOYFRIEND?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.574
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.443
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT?

14:03.476 --> 14:07.414
WHO WAS LAUGHING, KITTEN?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.449
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH WE MISSED YOU

14:09.482 --> 14:10.850
WHILE YOU WERE IN THE KITCHEN.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.386
AWW. ( giggles )

14:14.922 --> 14:17.424
WELL PLAYED.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.862
HEY.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.831
HEY, IS NEXT YEAR A
LEAP YEAR OR NOT?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.399
YEAH, I THINK IT IS.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.568
WHOO-HOO! I GET AN EXTRA DAY.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.570
WE ALL GET AN EXTRA DAY, MEL.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.572
NO NO NO, THIS IS
THE MASTER CALENDAR

14:32.605 --> 14:34.841
OF MY LIFE FOR THE NEXT
SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.577
- OH, WHAT ARE ALL THE LITTLE STARS?
- OH, THOSE ARE TRAVEL DAYS.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.480
- AND THE HEARTS?
- OH, THOSE ARE THE DAYS GEORGE AND I ARE TOGETHER.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.849
SEE, RED IS FOR TOLEDO
AND BLUE IS FOR ITALY.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.386
- WHAT ABOUT THE SMILEY FACES?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.421
YOU KNOW, IT'S
REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.590
IF I LEAVE WORK
NEXT FRIDAY AT 4:30

14:50.623 --> 14:53.426
AND DRIVE TWO HOURS TO CLEVELAND, I
CAN CATCH A NIGHT FLIGHT TO PHILLY,

14:53.460 --> 14:55.428
GRAB A CHEESESTEAK, TAKE
A RED-EYE TO MUNICH,

14:55.462 --> 14:58.398
WHICH GIVES ME JUST ENOUGH TIME FOR A
QUICK SCHNITZEL BEFORE LANDING IN MILAN.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.334
WHERE YOU'LL GET ANOTHER
QUICK SCHNITZEL.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.471
I'M NOT DONE YET. AFTER 48
HOURS OF I-MISS-YOU SEX...

15:04.504 --> 15:06.439
MY FAVORITE KIND...

15:06.473 --> 15:08.441
I HOP THREE MORE PLANES,
PICK UP NINE HOURS,

15:08.475 --> 15:11.311
AND I'M BACK IN TIME FOR RYDER'S
PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.313
SO WHAT HAPPENS TO
THE WHOLE HOUSE HERE

15:13.346 --> 15:16.583
WHEN YOU'RE OFF, YOU KNOW, ON
MEL BURKE'S AMAZING SEX RACE?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.585
I'VE TALKED TO RYDER AND
LENNOX AND THEY UNDERSTAND

15:18.618 --> 15:20.487
THAT I'LL MISS A COUPLE
OF HOURS HERE AND THERE.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.389
- A COUPLE HOURS?
- DAYS, WHATEVER.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.590
THEY GET IT. THEY'RE
COOL WITH IT.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.359
BESIDES, YOU'LL BE HERE. YOU'RE
IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.628
OH, SO THAT'S IT THEN? I JUST
TAKE CONTROL OF EVERYTHING...

15:28.661 --> 15:30.530
THE WHOLE HOUSE DEAL,
THE WHOLE KIDS DEAL?

15:30.563 --> 15:32.432
SO WHAT, AM I GONNA
SLAP ON A BLOND WIG

15:32.465 --> 15:34.401
AND GO DOWN TO CITY HALL
AND VOTE FOR YOU TOO?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.569
NO, MY TRIP WEEKS
ARE RECESS WEEKS.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.571
LOOK, GEORGE AND I SAID
WE'D MAKE IT WORK.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.441
AND, HELLO... PROOF.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.910
RELATIONSHIPS ARE
PRETTY TRICKY, MEL.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.646
IT'S HARD TO SQUEEZE THEM INTO
LITTLE 12-HOUR PACKETS OF TIME.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.548
- WHAT?
- ALL I'M SAYING IS,

15:48.581 --> 15:50.617
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T LIVE
YOUR LIFE ON PAPER.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.323
AUNT MEL, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE AT THE
AIRPORT SAYING GOODBYE TO GEORGE.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.524
OH, WE SAID GOODBYE THIS MORNING

15:57.557 --> 15:59.392
AND I HAD TO WORK ON
THE MASTER CALENDAR.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.394
BUT DON'T YOU WANT TO GIVE
HIM ONE OF THOSE BIG,

16:01.428 --> 16:03.696
ROMANTIC MOVIE-STYLE
GOODBYES TO SEND HIM OFF?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.632
I HATE SEEING PEOPLE
AT THE AIRPORT

16:05.665 --> 16:07.634
DOING THOSE BIG, LONG, MUSHY GOODBYES.
YOU KNOW...

16:07.667 --> 16:11.604
"OH, LOOK AT US. WE'RE SO IN LOVE.
WE'RE BETTER THAN YOU."

16:11.638 --> 16:15.408
YEAH, BUT THIS IS YOUR TURN TO
ACTUALLY BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE,

16:15.442 --> 16:17.410
GRAB HIM AND GIVE HIM
A KISS THAT SAYS,

16:17.444 --> 16:19.412
"TO HELL WITH THOSE
HOT ITALIAN MODELS.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.382
THIS IS WHAT'S WAITING
FOR YOU BACK HOME."

16:22.415 --> 16:24.384
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.553
WE ARE IN LOVE AND WE
ARE BETTER THAN YOU.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.621
I GOTTA GO.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.324
OH WAIT, I SHOULD
BRUSH MY TEETH.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.692
- THERE'S NO TIME.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.694
YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE IS AN AIR
FRESHENER ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.729
I'LL SUCK ON IT.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.701
EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME. SORRY.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.471
GIRLFRIEND COMING THROUGH.
I JUST... I JUST...

16:44.504 --> 16:45.705
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND EMERGENCY.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.574
GEORGE, WAIT.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.708
MEL?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.410
DON'T GO ANYWHERE. STAY THERE.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.545
MISS, YOUR TICKET.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.547
I'M JUST HERE TO SAY
GOODBYE TO MY BOYFRIEND

16:54.581 --> 16:57.717
AND I HAVE TO GIVE HIM, YOU
KNOW, THE PROPER GOODBYE KISS.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.353
OH, HONEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CONVINCE ME.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.589
WE HAVE A WHOLE SPECIAL AREA
JUST FOR PEOPLE IN LOVE.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.525
- REALLY?
- NO.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.561
YOU'RE THAT CITY
COUNCILWOMAN, AREN'T YOU?

17:08.595 --> 17:12.399
YOU CUT THE RIBBON FOR THE
NEW BAGGAGE CLAIM TERMINAL.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.667
DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT CARRYING
MY GIANT SCISSORS ON ME TODAY.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.536
YOU CAN FEEL ME UP.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.538
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF...?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.408
- THAT YOUNG ONE RIGHT THERE?
- YEAH.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.644
GOOD FOR YOU, GIRL.
GO RIGHT ON THROUGH.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.581
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I JUST CAME BY

17:28.615 --> 17:31.351
TO GIVE YOU AN OFFICIAL
MIND-BLOWING GOODBYE KISS.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.586
WARNING: YOU MAY
EXPERIENCE SOME DIZZINESS.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.459
LOOK AT THAT. AREN'T THEY SWEET?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.361
OH, Y'ALL ARE A CYNICAL GROUP.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.596
THERE'S ABOUT TO BE SOME
SERIOUS WANDING UP IN HERE.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.669
AH, WELL, NOW YOU CAN GO.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.505
NOW?

17:52.539 --> 17:54.474
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
LEAVE YOU AFTER THAT?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.444
THAT'S THE POINT OF IT, YOU KNOW, TO
GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.612
WELL, IT DID. I'M THINKING I
SHOULDN'T GET ON THIS PLANE.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.382
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- NO, I'M NOT.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.484
THIS IS YOUR BIG BREAK,
THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.686
YEAH, BUT I HAVE A CHANCE
OF A LIFETIME RIGHT HERE.

18:06.719 --> 18:10.723
MILAN IS JUST A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER ONE.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.660
WAIT, YOU WOULD GIVE UP MILAN
AND EVERYTHING FOR ME?

18:13.693 --> 18:14.727
THAT'S CRAZY.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.763
WELL, MAYBE I'M CRAZY.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.567
I'M NOT GOING.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.735
OKAY, YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE
CONFUSED BECAUSE I KISS SO GOOD.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.638
GEORGE, THIS IS A TURNING
POINT IN YOUR LIFE.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.640
YOU MAY NOT KNOWN
THAT, BUT I DO,

18:27.674 --> 18:31.444
BECAUSE, WELL, I'VE GOT A FEW
YEARS' EXPERIENCE ON YOU...

18:31.478 --> 18:33.446
ONE OR TWO. LET'S NOT COUNT.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.649
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT MY DREAM
JOB AND THIS COULD BE YOURS.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.652
AND IF WE, YOU
KNOW, TRY TOO HARD

18:39.686 --> 18:42.489
TO KEEP THIS THING GOING,
SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.491
WELL, WHAT ABOUT OUR SCHEDULE

18:44.524 --> 18:47.360
WHERE I FLY TO YOU
AND YOU FLY TO ME?

18:47.394 --> 18:48.495
THAT'LL NEVER WORK.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.497
GEORGE, YOU CAN'T LIVE
YOUR LIFE ON PAPER.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.665
DON'T YOU WANT US
TO BE TOGETHER?

18:52.699 --> 18:55.602
OF COURSE. BUT YOUR PROJECT
COULD BE A BIG SUCCESS.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.439
AND SIX MONTHS COULD TURN
INTO A YEAR OR TWO YEARS.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.375
I'M SAYING GO. HAVE YOUR LIFE.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.412
AND WHEN YOU GET
BACK, LOOK ME UP

19:05.445 --> 19:08.381
AND WE'LL SEE WHERE WE ARE.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.716
HOW ABOUT A GOODBYE KISS?

19:12.419 --> 19:14.654
LET'S CALL IT A TILL-THEN KISS.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.394
NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.566
- HEY.
- HEY THERE.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.402
SO I FIGURED YOU'D BE SAD AFTER
YOUR LONG GOODBYE WITH GEORGE,

19:29.436 --> 19:31.404
SO I MADE SOME
SWEET-POTATO GNOCCHI

19:31.438 --> 19:33.606
WITH SOME BROWN SUGAR AND
A LITTLE BUTTER AND SAGE,

19:33.640 --> 19:35.442
'CAUSE I KNOW IT'S
SOMEBODY'S FAVORITE.

19:35.475 --> 19:39.379
OH, THAT'S REALLY
NICE, BUT NOT HUNGRY.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.381
OH, COME ON, HE'S GONNA
BE BACK IN THREE WEEKS.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.649
IT SAYS SO ON YOUR CALENDAR.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.685
IT'S THE BOX WITH ALL THE
RAINBOWS AND THE SPARKLES.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.521
WELL, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
ANY RAINBOWS AND SPARKLES.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.523
I LET GEORGE GO...

19:50.557 --> 19:51.758
COMPLETELY. IT'S OVER.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.693
OH.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.695
I'M SORRY.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.698
YEAH WELL, I CAN'T JUST BE FLYING
BACK AND FORTH TO EUROPE ON A WHIM

19:58.731 --> 20:01.468
BECAUSE SOME SWEET, WONDERFUL
GUY LIKES ME, YOU KNOW.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.670
I'M NOT 24. I'VE
GOT MY LIFE HERE

20:03.703 --> 20:08.408
WITH MY JOB AND THE
KIDS AND THIS HOUSE.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.577
SO THAT'S IT FOR JUNIOR?

20:10.610 --> 20:13.680
OH, I HOPE I DIDN'T
MAKE A BIG MISTAKE.

20:13.713 --> 20:17.384
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF HE
WAS THE ONE, JOE?

20:17.417 --> 20:21.721
WHO ELSE COULD HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING SO PERFECTLY ME?

20:21.754 --> 20:25.492
YOU KNOW, SOME GUYS ARE
JUST LUCKY GUESSERS.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.760
( tune tinkling )

20:42.609 --> 20:44.577
SO, HOLLY, ARE YOU GONNA
BE JOINING US FOR DINNER?

20:44.611 --> 20:47.280
- NO, I HAVE TO GET HOME.
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.351
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE...

20:51.384 --> 20:53.353
YOU HAVE PARENTS THAT LOVE YOU,

20:53.386 --> 20:55.655
SO YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE
TO GET THAT LOVE HERE.

20:59.326 --> 21:02.295
DO YOU HAVE TO WRITE SO LOUD?

21:02.329 --> 21:05.365
IF YOU CAN'T WRITE SOFTER,
JUST DON'T WRITE AT ALL.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.301
YEAH, SURE, I'LL JUST
TAKE MENTAL NOTES...

21:08.335 --> 21:10.503
VERY QUIET MENTAL NOTES.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.505
IT'S LIKE WATCHING ONE
OF THOSE NATURE SHOWS,

21:12.539 --> 21:15.442
YOU KNOW, WHERE THE LIONESS TAKES
DOWN THE DEFENSELESS BABY ZEBRA.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.277
EXCEPT IT'S OVER
QUICK FOR THE ZEBRA.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.546
( phone chimes )

21:19.579 --> 21:21.548
- WHO'S BEEN TEXTING YOU ALL DAY?
- NOBODY. NO ONE.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.583
MY MOTHER IS SENDING YOU
PICTURES OF COOKIES?

21:23.616 --> 21:26.252
- NO, STOP SCROLLING.
- IS THIS HER FRIED CHICKEN?

21:26.285 --> 21:28.254
IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.490
SHE'S BRIBING YOU WITH FOOD SO
YOU'LL KEEP GOING OUT WITH ME?

21:30.523 --> 21:32.459
THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.428
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH
YOU IN PRIVATE.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.637
( theme music playing )
