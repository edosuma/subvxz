00:00.120 --> 00:03.160
Previously onHawaii Five-O:
STEVE: Wearing that suit in here

00:03.160 --> 00:05.500
does not guarantee
your protection.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.620
Don't worry about me.

00:07.620 --> 00:08.990
Worry about him.

00:08.990 --> 00:12.080
You remember me,
Detective Williams?

00:12.080 --> 00:15.790
Oh, I don't know who you are.
Should I know who you are?

00:15.790 --> 00:16.790
(Danny groans)

00:16.790 --> 00:18.990
STEVE:
Danny! Danny!

00:20.410 --> 00:21.990
(gun fires)

00:22.990 --> 00:23.990
Who is that guy? Who is he?

00:23.990 --> 00:25.990
KELLER:We need to get him
into the O.R. now,

00:25.990 --> 00:26.990
or we are gonna lose him.

00:26.990 --> 00:28.200
It was, uh, touch and go

00:28.200 --> 00:30.830
for a while, but, uh...
(prolonged beep)

00:30.830 --> 00:32.160
he pulled through.

00:32.160 --> 00:32.700
Yes!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.410
KELLER:He's gonna be okay.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.990
You get anything on the gunman?
Nothing.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.290
DANNY:
All right.

00:46.290 --> 00:47.990
I baked the special
Christmas cookies.

00:47.990 --> 00:50.700
No snooping, please.
I wasn't snooping.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.990
No? Okay.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.990
All right, so these
are very, very, very hot.

00:53.990 --> 00:55.830
Do not touch them.
You will burn your face off.

00:55.830 --> 00:57.120
All right? But you can
help me blow on them.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.790
Uh, because I got a little
jam-up on my right side here,

01:00.790 --> 01:02.450
and I can't blow so well, so...

01:02.450 --> 01:04.540
why don't you
do that for me?

01:04.540 --> 01:05.700
Thank you.

01:05.700 --> 01:06.330
Thanks.

01:06.330 --> 01:07.540
How we doing
over there?

01:07.540 --> 01:10.250
ADAM:
Actually, I think we're done.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.500
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.370
Are you positive
that Santa Claus

01:13.370 --> 01:14.950
can get through
that chimney?

01:14.950 --> 01:17.330
Yeah, I am happy to report
the Williams' chimney

01:17.330 --> 01:18.120
is now ready for entry.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.580
No chance Santa
gets stuck tonight.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.330
In fact, he might bring
a couple reindeer

01:22.330 --> 01:23.990
down with him.
That is fantastic.

01:23.990 --> 01:26.500
Isn't it? What do you say to...
(Adam and Charlie chuckling)

01:26.500 --> 01:27.990
What do you say to Uncle Adam?

01:27.990 --> 01:29.990
Thank you, Uncle Adam.

01:29.990 --> 01:30.750
You are very welcome.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.580
All right,
chimney's good.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.660
Cookies. What are we missing?
What are we missing?

01:35.660 --> 01:37.450
Um, Santa's special plate.

01:37.450 --> 01:39.910
That's right.
Go get it.

01:41.660 --> 01:42.990
Thank you very much.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.000
He, uh... he gets a big kick
out of all this.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna
let you climb up there.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.990
I don't even know
why you're out of bed.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.120
How's your chest feeling,
by the way?

01:52.120 --> 01:54.950
I'm... I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:54.950 --> 01:55.990
It's not... doesn't even hurt.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.750
He's, uh, curious, but I didn't
tell him what happened,

01:58.750 --> 02:01.120
because he worries,
so just don't say anything.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.410
I don't think you would,
but, anyway...

02:03.410 --> 02:03.990
Got it. Yeah.

02:03.990 --> 02:07.450
They-they, uh, have any luck
I.D.'ing the shooter yet?

02:07.450 --> 02:10.120
No, nothing.
(sighs)

02:10.660 --> 02:12.660
All right, what,
uh... what are you...

02:12.660 --> 02:13.910
what are you
doing tonight?

02:13.910 --> 02:15.620
I'm just
going home to pack.

02:15.620 --> 02:17.250
Uh, I'm meeting Kono in L.A.,

02:17.250 --> 02:19.250
and, uh, my flight leaves
at the crack of dawn.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.620
Well, then extra special
thank you for doing this.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.950
It's nothing.
Hey, hey, hey.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.200
What, you think
I didn't see that?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.950
You gotta test 'em out, right?
Quality control?

02:26.950 --> 02:29.290
All right. Put the, uh,
cookies on the plate.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.580
Let's go.
Get 'em ready.

02:31.580 --> 02:33.870
Three, four.
That's good enough.

02:33.870 --> 02:34.990
He's getting big.
Go ahead.

02:34.990 --> 02:36.450
Put it over there
by the chimney,

02:36.450 --> 02:37.910
and, uh, I'll be
in your room

02:37.910 --> 02:39.830
and read you a
story in a minute.

02:39.830 --> 02:40.950
How about
right there?

02:40.950 --> 02:42.830
Say good night
to Uncle Adam, too.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.620
Good night, Uncle Adam.

02:44.620 --> 02:47.000
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

02:50.290 --> 02:51.950
Want a cookie?

02:51.950 --> 02:53.200
No, I'm good.
You're good?

02:53.200 --> 02:55.540
I gotta ask--
what-what happens to those?

02:55.540 --> 02:57.910
Oh, I eat them,
leave the crumbs.

02:57.910 --> 02:58.700
He thinks Santa ate them.

02:58.700 --> 03:02.290
Believe me, you'll do the
same thing with your kids.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.750
Yeah, I look forward
to that someday.

03:06.750 --> 03:07.410
(sighs):
Yeah.

03:07.410 --> 03:08.620
All right,
I'll leave you to it.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.990
Hey, what, uh, story
you gonna read him tonight?

03:10.990 --> 03:14.120
Oh, I don't know. Uh, I usually
do, like, the traditionals,

03:14.120 --> 03:15.990
like the Grinch and
the normal stuff.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.080
But I want to mix it
up tonight, I think.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.040
All right.
Right? Hey.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.290
Hey.
Have a safe flight.

03:20.290 --> 03:21.040
Merry Christmas, buddy.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.990
Tell Kono hello, please.
Will do.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.620
What's up, buddy?

03:29.620 --> 03:31.870
Which one should we do first?

03:31.870 --> 03:33.790
I don't know. Let's see.

03:33.790 --> 03:37.040
Let's see what you got.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.830
That's a good one.

03:40.830 --> 03:43.580
These are all good ones,
but I was thinking

03:43.580 --> 03:45.990
maybe, um, we do a...
a special story.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.040
A real special story
that nobody...

03:47.040 --> 03:49.750
nobody in the history of the
world has ever heard before.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.040
You'd be the first.
What do you think?
Really?

03:52.040 --> 03:54.000
What kind of story is it?
It's a...

03:54.000 --> 03:55.950
it's a crazy, mixed-up,
uh, insane story

03:55.950 --> 03:57.250
that'll make you
feel good inside

03:57.250 --> 03:59.620
because it is
a Christmas miracle.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.950
You, uh, interested in
that sort of thing?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.250
Yes.
Okay, so...

04:03.250 --> 04:05.330
it was, uh... it was
Christmastime on Oahu,

04:05.330 --> 04:09.000
and everybody... everybody had
the holiday spirit going on.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.750
Especially this one jolly fella
in a red suit.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.790
(bells jingling)
MAN: Merry Christmas!

04:20.580 --> 04:22.370
Mahalo.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.040
Happy holidays.

04:25.990 --> 04:29.080
Merry Christmas.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.160
May God bless you.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.080
(coins clink)
Mahalo.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.910
Ho ho ho!

04:37.910 --> 04:40.040
Happy holidays.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.040
(coins clink)

04:44.040 --> 04:48.750
Oh. Hey, buddy,
you forgot this one.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.120
Peace be with you.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.160
(engine starts)
Merry Christmas.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.790
CHARLIE:Wait a second.

05:01.790 --> 05:03.370
Why does Santa have a phone?

05:03.370 --> 05:06.790
Well, 'cause he's, uh,
not the real Santa.

05:06.790 --> 05:08.080
He's like a fugazi Santa.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.990
Okay? He's a
naughty Santa.

05:09.990 --> 05:10.750
He's a bad Santa.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.290
And he wasn't even
using the phone

05:12.290 --> 05:14.370
to make a real
phone call.

05:16.990 --> 05:21.250
(people screaming,
tires squealing)

05:26.540 --> 05:28.250
(groans)

05:29.450 --> 05:31.500
(yells)

05:40.890 --> 05:42.540
Go, go, go, go, go!
CHARLIE:Why were the bad guys

05:42.540 --> 05:44.040
dressed like Santa?

05:44.140 --> 05:45.590
What happened
to all the money?

05:45.590 --> 05:47.430
Did the bad Santas get away?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.100
Okay, these are good questions,
and I am gonna

05:49.100 --> 05:51.590
answer all of them,
but first we need to settle in

05:51.590 --> 05:53.720
because this story
is just getting started.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.590
(heavy gunfire)

05:55.590 --> 05:59.590
(Hawaii Five-O
theme song plays)

06:27.510 --> 06:28.090
See that?

06:28.090 --> 06:30.890
Looks like Santa's right over
New Jersey right now.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.090
That's good news.

06:32.090 --> 06:33.850
Is he gonna visit Aunt Bridget?

06:33.850 --> 06:34.970
Yeah, he's gonna
visit Aunt Bridget.

06:34.970 --> 06:36.260
He's gonna do that.
He's gonna do that.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.050
He's a big guy,
but he's very fast.

06:38.050 --> 06:39.050
He's gonna visit
Aunt Bridget,

06:39.050 --> 06:40.800
and then he's gonna come
make his way over here,

06:40.800 --> 06:42.550
so we gotta get this
story going, don't we?

06:42.550 --> 06:47.090
What happened after
the bad guys robbed the truck?

06:47.090 --> 06:50.050
Well, uh... oh,
I made a mista...

06:50.050 --> 06:51.090
I forgot, I gotta
go backwards.

06:51.090 --> 06:52.140
There's characters
in this story

06:52.140 --> 06:54.260
that I want to introduce
you to that I forgot.

06:54.260 --> 06:55.390
Is that all right?
Who?

06:55.390 --> 06:58.600
Who? Who? I'll tell you
who, my little owl.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.100
Um, they are, uh, people.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.090
Here's a hint, by the way.

07:01.090 --> 07:03.930
They're people that are
going to feed other people,

07:03.930 --> 07:05.890
bring food to other people
that are very hungry

07:05.890 --> 07:06.970
at a place called
a shelter.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.550
Why would they do
something like this?

07:08.550 --> 07:09.760
They're the good guys.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.350
Yes, of course they're
the good guys.

07:11.350 --> 07:13.720
That's my man.
Good guess.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.600
You guys should grab your
coffees before it gets cold.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.350
Hey, thanks
for picking these up.
Yeah.

07:22.350 --> 07:24.850
It's not so much fun
being with Kekoa

07:24.850 --> 07:27.090
before he's had
his caffeine.

07:27.090 --> 07:28.550
Bite me, Frank.

07:28.550 --> 07:29.890
See?

07:29.890 --> 07:32.090
Hey. What's taking so long
to get there?

07:32.090 --> 07:35.090
It's the parade.
Traffic's jacked up.

07:35.090 --> 07:35.680
Parades.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.100
Another reason
why I hate holidays.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.100
Come on, Josie.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.100
Where's your Christmas spirit?

07:42.100 --> 07:43.600
Get off my case.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.350
I ordered a peppermint latte.

07:45.350 --> 07:48.090
That's about
as yuletide as I get.

07:48.090 --> 07:50.180
Who ordered the mocha-chino?

07:50.180 --> 07:51.720
Right here.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.090
(mechanical whirring)

07:54.100 --> 07:56.470
Yo, Henry, you didn't
order nothing?

07:56.470 --> 08:00.090
DANNY:
So these good guys-- right?--
are, uh, veterans.

08:00.090 --> 08:02.100
Do you know what
veterans are?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.890
Uh, no.

08:03.890 --> 08:05.090
Veterans are people, uh...

08:05.090 --> 08:07.470
men and women that spend
their whole lives

08:07.470 --> 08:09.930
making sure that this country
is a safe place.

08:09.930 --> 08:10.850
Pretty cool, huh?

08:10.850 --> 08:12.470
Like you, Danno.
Yeah, just like me,

08:12.470 --> 08:14.930
but these people...
these people are, like,

08:14.930 --> 08:16.090
real, real, like, heroes.

08:16.090 --> 08:18.390
You know, like,
American heroes?

08:18.390 --> 08:19.090
And, coincidentally,

08:19.090 --> 08:21.890
the person that they were
gonna meet up with later,

08:21.890 --> 08:25.510
he is also a hero-- kind of.

08:25.510 --> 08:27.090
Junior, slight change in plans.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.010
JUNIOR:
Everything okay, Commander?
Uh, everything's fine.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.100
I'm still gonna meet you
at the shelter, but listen,

08:31.100 --> 08:33.090
my sister and niece
just arrived in town,

08:33.090 --> 08:34.390
and I'm not gonna miss a chance

08:34.390 --> 08:36.390
to put that little girl
on my shoulders

08:36.390 --> 08:38.090
at this parade, okay?

08:38.090 --> 08:39.640
Yeah, I understand, sir.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.140
Thanks, buddy.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.090
They don't get out here
very often.

08:42.090 --> 08:45.090
(explosion, people screaming)

08:46.090 --> 08:46.970
Commander?

08:46.970 --> 08:49.090
Commander, everything okay?

08:49.090 --> 08:51.140
Junior, I gotta call you back.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.180
CHARLIE:Uh-oh.

08:52.180 --> 08:54.600
"Uh-oh" is right.
Our hero guy is about

08:54.600 --> 08:56.090
to run into these bad
Santa Claus.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.970
This is no good.
This is a tragedy

08:57.970 --> 08:59.260
waiting to happen,
don't you think?

08:59.260 --> 09:00.220
He should've
called the police.

09:00.220 --> 09:01.800
Of course he should've
called the police,

09:01.800 --> 09:05.090
like a normal person would,
but this isn't a normal person,

09:05.090 --> 09:06.510
and on top of everything else,

09:06.510 --> 09:07.850
this guy is a cop.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.260
And he's a good person--
kind of.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.300
Anyway, that's not the point.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.890
He-- this cop--
went after these guys.

09:12.890 --> 09:14.300
He even left his gun
in his car, 'cause he

09:14.300 --> 09:16.090
didn't want to bring his gun
to the parade.

09:16.090 --> 09:19.090
He went after these guys
without a gun.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.680
CHARLIE:Wait.
DANNY:"Wait" what?

09:29.680 --> 09:32.300
Why did the man
in the truck

09:32.300 --> 09:34.090
give the crazy man his gun?

09:34.090 --> 09:35.550
He didn't want it anymore?

09:35.550 --> 09:37.800
No, he wanted it. He just...

09:37.800 --> 09:39.550
he decided that he thought
the crazy man

09:39.550 --> 09:42.090
should have the gun
so he could after the bad guys.

09:42.090 --> 09:43.970
You know what I mean?
Okay.

09:43.970 --> 09:47.090
All right, so wait. Hold on.
So this is the crazy part.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.050
Hey! Five-O!

09:57.680 --> 09:59.350
(tires squealing)

10:04.720 --> 10:06.430
DANNY:Wouldn't you know it?

10:06.430 --> 10:08.510
Bad guys ran out of gas.

10:08.510 --> 10:10.050
They should've
filled it up before.

10:10.050 --> 10:11.090
Of course they
should've

10:11.090 --> 10:12.550
filled it up before--
like smart people--

10:12.550 --> 10:14.760
but they're not
very smart people, right?

10:14.760 --> 10:16.850
Anyway, our cop--
our crazy guy--

10:16.850 --> 10:20.890
he goes and tries
to get them to give up.

10:27.050 --> 10:29.220
DANNY:Bang, bang! Bang, bang!

10:29.220 --> 10:30.090
(chuckles)

10:30.090 --> 10:32.180
Is the crazy guy
Uncle Steve?

10:32.180 --> 10:34.640
Now, let me ask you a question.
What gave it away,

10:34.640 --> 10:37.640
the "crazy man" part
or the "policeman" part?

10:37.640 --> 10:39.890
(chuckling)

10:47.260 --> 10:50.090
(crowd chattering, whistling)

10:51.010 --> 10:53.720

♪ ♪

11:33.800 --> 11:34.600
CHARLIE:Oh, no!

11:34.600 --> 11:36.090
What's the matter, buddy?
What's the problem?

11:36.090 --> 11:39.300
How's Uncle Steve gonna
find the bad guys?

11:39.300 --> 11:41.010
Okay. (clears throat)

11:41.010 --> 11:42.970
Let's go back.
Remember what I told you

11:42.970 --> 11:44.220
what kind of story this is?

11:44.220 --> 11:45.890
A miracle?
That's right.

11:45.890 --> 11:47.050
It's a Christmas miracle,
all right?

11:47.050 --> 11:51.090
So don't worry about nothing.
Everything's gonna be okay.

11:51.090 --> 11:51.930
All right?

11:51.930 --> 11:54.260
Danno, are miracles real?

11:54.260 --> 11:55.050
Are miracles real?

11:55.050 --> 11:56.390
What am I doing here?
What am I talking...?

11:56.390 --> 11:58.260
I'm telling you a story
about a miracle right now.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.890
Anybody ever tells you
that miracles aren't real,

12:00.890 --> 12:04.090
I want you to tell them
this story as proof

12:04.090 --> 12:06.140
that miracles do happen, okay?

12:06.980 --> 12:08.600
DANNY: So the bad guys, they
come crashing through the crowd,

12:08.600 --> 12:10.770
and they're saying, "Everybody
down! Everybody out of the way,

12:10.770 --> 12:11.850
out of the way, out of the way!"

12:11.850 --> 12:12.770
And they're running
really fast.

12:12.770 --> 12:13.890
This one's fast.
This one's faster.

12:13.890 --> 12:15.890
They're both fast.
Then you got Steve.

12:15.890 --> 12:16.900
And this is Uncle Steve.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.890
Doesn't this look
like Uncle Steve?

12:18.890 --> 12:19.690
No.
It doesn't?

12:19.690 --> 12:20.890
Ithink it does.
Maybe it's 'cause

12:20.890 --> 12:22.060
I know him better than you do.
Anyway...

12:22.060 --> 12:23.890
these guys, they feel
that they're being followed,

12:23.890 --> 12:26.810
so one of 'em goes this way,
the other goes this way.

12:26.810 --> 12:29.810
Steve-- the donkey--
he's gotta make a choice, right?

12:29.810 --> 12:31.190
He's gotta choose
who to follow, right?

12:31.190 --> 12:33.060
Can't follow them both.
He's gotta pick one.

12:33.060 --> 12:35.480
And did he catch 'em?

12:35.480 --> 12:36.890
Sort of.

12:37.810 --> 12:38.900
Stop! Freeze.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.850
Drop the sack.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.890
Put the gun on the ground.

12:47.890 --> 12:50.890
All right, all right.
All right.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.270
Now lie down
on the ground.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.890
Pick up the sack.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.690
DANNY:Okay, so I know exactly

13:07.690 --> 13:09.690
what you're thinking--
why would Uncle Steve

13:09.690 --> 13:10.230
get down on the floor?

13:10.230 --> 13:12.520
I mean, why wouldn't he
just chase the bad Santa?

13:12.520 --> 13:13.730
But the truth
of the matter is

13:13.730 --> 13:14.650
there were people
everywhere, right?

13:14.650 --> 13:16.310
And he didn't want
anybody to get hurt.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.850
So he was just
following instructions.

13:17.850 --> 13:19.100
He got down,
and he unfortunately

13:19.100 --> 13:21.690
had to let one
of the Santas go.

13:21.690 --> 13:22.270
But why would he...

13:22.270 --> 13:23.980
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Did you, uh...

13:23.980 --> 13:26.100
did you brush your teeth
after you ate that cookie?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.020
No.
I didn't think so.

13:27.020 --> 13:31.060
Danno, how come Uncle Steve's
friends didn't help him?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.270
That's a very
good question.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.310
Uh, the answer
is that they were, uh...

13:34.310 --> 13:36.890
they were very busy
doing very important stuff.

13:36.890 --> 13:40.190

Jerry, if you don't sing

then the whole damn thing
is ass backwards.

Guys, there was an armored car
heist a few minutes ago,

14:35.890 --> 14:37.020
and it happened
right by the parade.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.230
Wait, isn't McGarrett
supposed to be

14:38.230 --> 14:39.730
at that parade
with-with Mary and Joanie?

14:39.730 --> 14:40.810
Yeah. I'm trying
to call his cell.

14:40.810 --> 14:44.520
He's not answering.
Well, let's ping his cell.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.850
He's on the move.

14:50.850 --> 14:54.060
That means he's in pursuit.
Let's go.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.730
Hey. Hey.
(whimpering)

14:58.730 --> 15:00.850
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.

15:00.850 --> 15:01.890
Can you sit up?
Yeah.

15:01.890 --> 15:03.890
You okay?
Yeah.

15:03.890 --> 15:05.850
Where'd he go?
Over there.

15:05.850 --> 15:06.480
Okay, listen to me.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.890
I'm gonna get help, okay?
You stay right here.

15:08.890 --> 15:10.850
All right.
Okay.

15:25.810 --> 15:27.150
DANNY:Okay, so...

15:27.150 --> 15:29.940
we got the bad guys hiding
in the mall, right?

15:29.940 --> 15:32.400
Clear on that.
Steve, he knows this.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.890
Right? He's very
aware of this.

15:33.890 --> 15:37.730
He doesn't want 'em to get away.
The mall's a big place.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.980
So he has the police show up...

15:39.980 --> 15:42.890
surround the place like that.

15:42.890 --> 15:44.980
What about
Uncle Steve's friends?

15:44.980 --> 15:47.560
They came.
They showed up. Bang.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.850
Jerry, are you sure
they're still in there?

15:54.850 --> 15:56.650
Affirmative. I'm looking
at street-cam footage

15:56.650 --> 15:57.480
from about ten minutes ago.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.190
I got Santa releasing a
female hostage onto King Street.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.890
Then I pick up the same guy

16:01.890 --> 16:04.020
on a different camera
a few minutes later.

16:04.020 --> 16:05.890
He meets up
with the other Santa,

16:05.890 --> 16:06.890
and they enter the mall.

16:06.890 --> 16:08.600
All right, tell me
you can pull the cameras

16:08.600 --> 16:10.560
inside this mall.
Uh, pulling it up now.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.350
All right, good.
See if you can get eyes

16:12.350 --> 16:15.310
on our suspects
and get back to me, all right?

16:15.890 --> 16:16.900
We need a plan.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.890
Seems pretty
straightforward to me.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.190
We shut the place down,
do a store-to-store search.

16:21.190 --> 16:23.890
No, no, no. These guys
are armed, all right?

16:23.890 --> 16:24.770
And they have shown

16:24.770 --> 16:26.560
they are not afraid
to use those weapons,

16:26.560 --> 16:27.890
regardless of civilian casualty.

16:27.890 --> 16:31.190
We go in there snooping around,
they see us, we end up

16:31.190 --> 16:32.520
with a hostage situation
or, worse yet,

16:32.520 --> 16:34.890
a firefight inside a
crowded mall at Christmastime.

16:34.890 --> 16:36.190
What do you want to do, then?

16:36.190 --> 16:37.020
Write a letter to Santa Claus,

16:37.020 --> 16:39.230
tell him to put 'em
on the naughty list

16:39.230 --> 16:40.100
unless they give
themselves up?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.560
That's very funny.
We have a tactical advantage.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.890
They don't know
we tracked 'em to this mall.

16:44.890 --> 16:46.890
TANI:
Right, so we go
into the mall

16:46.890 --> 16:48.600
as civilians--
no guns, no badges--

16:48.600 --> 16:50.020
and we catch them by surprise?

16:50.020 --> 16:51.650
Exactly.
All right,
I'm with it.

16:51.650 --> 16:54.480
Let's make it happen.
I got gifts to wrap.

16:54.810 --> 16:55.900
STEVE:
Junior, what are you
doing here?

16:55.900 --> 16:57.560
When I didn't hear
back from you,

16:57.560 --> 17:00.100
I called Jerry, and he let me
know what was going on,

17:00.100 --> 17:02.400
and I came here as
fast as I could,

17:02.400 --> 17:04.890
and I brought
some backup.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.850
Everyone, meet Kekoa,

17:07.850 --> 17:11.350
Reggie, Frank, Josie.

17:11.350 --> 17:12.890
And that's, uh, Henry.

17:12.890 --> 17:14.310
Sir, these guys want
to help out,

17:14.310 --> 17:16.310
and I think, with their
skills and experience,

17:16.310 --> 17:20.400
they could prove useful.
FRANK: Reporting for
duty, Commander.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.480
They went into the mall?
Yeah, they went

17:26.480 --> 17:28.770
into the mall, but there was
a problem, you see,

17:28.770 --> 17:30.890
because the mall
is a very, very big place.

17:30.890 --> 17:31.890
Right? And
Steve could not

17:31.890 --> 17:33.190
search the place
all by himself, so, uh,

17:33.190 --> 17:35.890
lucky for him, his friends
showed up to help him,

17:35.890 --> 17:37.730
along with, uh, some angels.

17:37.730 --> 17:38.900
Real angels?

17:38.900 --> 17:39.940
Yeah, of course real angels.

17:39.940 --> 17:43.560
I told you,
this is a Christmas miracle.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.810
I have all the respect
in the world

17:46.810 --> 17:48.730
for retired
service people,

17:48.730 --> 17:51.350
but I-I don't know
if this is the situation...

17:51.350 --> 17:52.190
Excuse me, sir.

17:52.190 --> 17:55.480
Major Frank Bella,
3rd Brigade, Ivy Division.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.480
I used to work in this
mall a few years back.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.890
(chuckles) Place is so big,
I got lost on my first day.

18:00.890 --> 18:04.650
I don't see how any
of that information helps us.

18:04.650 --> 18:04.980
Point being,

18:04.980 --> 18:07.730
you could use a guy inside
who knows his way around.

18:07.730 --> 18:09.480
STEVE: I don't disagree
with you there, Major,

18:09.480 --> 18:12.770
but the thing is we got hostiles
in there, they're armed,

18:12.770 --> 18:14.100
extremely dangerous,
and I'm just not prepared

18:14.100 --> 18:15.980
to put more civilians
in harm's way.

18:15.980 --> 18:19.100
HM-1 Josie Ackerman,
3rd Battalion, 5th Marine.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.150
All due respect, Commander,

18:21.150 --> 18:23.150
all of us here have taken
fire behind enemy lines.

18:23.150 --> 18:28.440
You really think we can't handle
a couple of Santas... sir?

18:28.940 --> 18:31.190
DANNY:I think, you know,

18:31.190 --> 18:32.150
she had a point.

18:32.150 --> 18:32.940
Couple of rotten Santas

18:32.940 --> 18:34.020
were nothing compared
to the bad guys

18:34.020 --> 18:36.730
that she was used to fighting
when she was a soldier, right?

18:36.730 --> 18:39.230
And Frank, Frank, he-he knows
his way around the mall.

18:39.230 --> 18:40.600
Right?
And Steve knew that.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.890
He's kind of intelligent.

18:41.890 --> 18:43.060
He realized that
Frank could be helpful.

18:43.060 --> 18:44.770
Right? All of them
could be helpful.

18:44.770 --> 18:46.560
So he decided
to let them help.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.890
The vets-- are
they the angels?

18:50.560 --> 18:51.890
What do you think?

18:51.890 --> 18:52.890
Mm-hmm.
That's right.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.400
'Cause you're very smart.

18:54.400 --> 18:54.890
Very clever.

18:54.890 --> 18:56.650
Mommy tells me that
all the time.

18:56.650 --> 18:59.400
She says I get
it from her.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.600
She does?

19:00.600 --> 19:01.730
She's right. You do.

19:01.730 --> 19:03.020
You get it from her.

19:03.020 --> 19:04.520
Anyway, uh, Jerry and Steve

19:04.520 --> 19:07.890
had to have a, uh,
phone conversation.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.270
JERRY: Got 'em.
Santas are on level two.

19:09.270 --> 19:11.890
It looks like they're heading
into that department store.

19:11.890 --> 19:13.060
STEVE:
You got cameras inside

19:13.060 --> 19:16.520
of that department store?
JERRY: Checking.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.650
They're not online.
It must be closed-circuit.

19:18.650 --> 19:20.020
All right,
keep an eye on the exits.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.890
Let me know
if they go back out.

19:21.890 --> 19:22.890
Oh, and one more thing.

19:22.890 --> 19:24.850
Looks like Adam's in the mall.

19:24.850 --> 19:25.900
Our Adam? Adam Noshimuri?

19:25.900 --> 19:29.520
Yeah, I guess he's doing
some last-minute shopping.

19:29.890 --> 19:31.230
STEVE:All right,
get in touch with him.

19:31.230 --> 19:32.150
Let him know what's going on.

19:32.150 --> 19:35.100
Have him stand by
in case we need his help.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.850
Roger.

19:41.850 --> 19:44.730
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.310
Now, Junior,
you're gonna take the vets,

19:46.310 --> 19:47.890
you guys are gonna clear
the department store,

19:47.890 --> 19:48.940
but you're gonna do it
stealthy,

19:48.940 --> 19:50.270
you're gonna do it quiet,

19:50.270 --> 19:53.150
you're gonna make sure
nobody panics.

19:53.810 --> 19:58.400
Lou, Tani, let's go get
some bad guys.

20:09.020 --> 20:11.690
We got a little bit
of an emergency.

20:11.690 --> 20:13.890
♪ ♪

20:37.190 --> 20:39.560
♪ ♪

21:06.940 --> 21:09.230
They ditched their costumes.

21:10.020 --> 21:10.890
TANI:
Great.

21:10.890 --> 21:14.650
Now our two suspects look
like everyone else in this mall.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.510
Okay, we're good.
Milk's all set.

21:20.510 --> 21:21.640
Cookies are still there.
If he would've

21:21.640 --> 21:24.140
showed up,
we would've heard him, right?

21:25.350 --> 21:27.590
(yawns)

21:27.590 --> 21:29.590
I saw that.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.390
No, please, Danno,
I want to hear

21:31.390 --> 21:32.510
what happened to the bad guys.

21:32.510 --> 21:34.590
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go,

21:34.590 --> 21:37.590
let's go, let's go.
Get in there. Come on.

21:37.590 --> 21:38.720
(chuckling)

21:38.720 --> 21:41.350
Okay, so if you remember
correctly, the bad Santas,

21:41.350 --> 21:42.590
they've taken off
their costumes,

21:42.590 --> 21:46.550
so now they look like everybody
else in the mall, right?

21:46.550 --> 21:47.100
Right?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.800
How's Uncle Steve
gonna catch them?

21:49.800 --> 21:51.930
Well, that's a good question,

21:51.930 --> 21:55.850
but Uncle Steve,
he had some ideas, you know?

21:57.800 --> 22:00.550
That's a lot of stuff
you've got there.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.140
Will that be
cash or credit?

22:02.140 --> 22:03.010
Neither.

22:03.010 --> 22:04.510
Here you go, kid.
Five-O discount.

22:04.510 --> 22:06.300
We'll be back. Come on.
CHARLIE:They stole it?

22:06.300 --> 22:09.590
Well, no, these are good guys
we're talking about,

22:09.590 --> 22:10.680
so they don't steal;
they borrow.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.720
They just borrowed it
so that they could set up a...

22:13.720 --> 22:14.600
a checkpoint.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.680
What's a checkpoint?

22:16.680 --> 22:18.050
A checkpoint is, uh,

22:18.050 --> 22:20.590
basically how you catch
bad guys,

22:20.590 --> 22:23.760
um... when you don't know
what they look like.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.590
No, that doesn't make any sense.

22:25.590 --> 22:28.510
Okay, here it is.
Steve-- he called

22:28.510 --> 22:29.300
all the people in the mall,

22:29.300 --> 22:30.510
and he said,
"Get out of the mall.

22:30.510 --> 22:31.590
Quick, everybody
get out of the mall."

22:31.590 --> 22:32.590
All the shoppers gotta
get out of the mall.

22:32.590 --> 22:35.350
On the way out, the good guys
will check their I.D.'s.

22:35.350 --> 22:37.300
Their identification
says who they are.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.720
And what you do is you take
that identification

22:39.720 --> 22:41.760
and you run it against, um...

22:41.760 --> 22:42.890
uh, a list--
like, a bad-guy list.

22:42.890 --> 22:45.590
And if you do something bad,
you end up on this list.

22:45.590 --> 22:48.590
A naughty list, like Santa's?

22:48.590 --> 22:49.510
That's exactly what it is.

22:49.510 --> 22:51.890
Uh, and Jerry--
Uncle Jerry, coincidentally,

22:51.890 --> 22:55.100
he had one of these lists.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.590
JERRY: Okay, Lou,
I'm ready on this end.

22:57.590 --> 22:59.350
GROVER:
Stand by, Jerry.

22:59.550 --> 23:03.430
Ladies and gentlemen,
please have your I.D.'s out.

23:03.430 --> 23:05.100
This is Special Operator
Kekoa Maki.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.590
Who am I speaking to?

23:06.590 --> 23:08.260
This is Special Consultant
Jerry Ortega.

23:08.260 --> 23:09.590
All right,
Special Consultant Ortega,

23:09.590 --> 23:10.850
we're gonna have to run
these checks fast,

23:10.850 --> 23:12.590
or we'll be looking at one hell
of a bottleneck here.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.550
You ready to patch me
into your system?

23:15.550 --> 23:16.390
Aye, sir.

23:16.390 --> 23:18.390
You a Navy boy, Ortega?

23:18.390 --> 23:19.720
Uh, no.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.470
What branch were you with?

23:21.470 --> 23:22.470
No branch.

23:22.470 --> 23:24.100
You've never been in uniform?

23:24.100 --> 23:26.590
Outside of high school
marching band... no.

23:26.590 --> 23:27.970
(chuckles) All right.

23:27.970 --> 23:29.600
Well, you sound
like good people.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.430
I'm glad we're in
the trenches together.

23:32.430 --> 23:34.180
Stand by.
I'm sending you a secure link.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.850
Of course,
that's a relative term

23:35.850 --> 23:38.010
when you're used to uplinking
with Milstar satellites.

23:38.010 --> 23:40.050
Whoa.
You were a comms specialist?

23:40.050 --> 23:41.100
Yes, sir.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.010
7th Infantry in Afghanistan.

23:42.010 --> 23:44.430
I used to have to do this stuff
on the scramble

23:44.430 --> 23:46.220
so the enemy couldn't lock
onto my signal,

23:46.220 --> 23:49.050
take me and my boys out
with an aerial strike.

23:49.050 --> 23:50.010
Wow.

23:50.010 --> 23:51.680
Well, thank you
for your service.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.050
And for helping us out today.

23:53.050 --> 23:54.220
Oh, no need to thank me, man.

23:54.220 --> 23:57.550
I'm just glad to be back
in the saddle again.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.390
All right, Ortega,
let's catch some bad guys.

24:00.390 --> 24:02.260
Ready.
CHARLIE:What about
the other angels?

24:02.260 --> 24:05.600
Were they helping?
Of course they were helping.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.590
They were helping a lot.

24:06.590 --> 24:08.590
This one guy Henry,
he had a very important job.

24:08.590 --> 24:11.640
His job was to try to find out
who the Santas were--

24:11.640 --> 24:14.390
the bad Santas--
when they weren't in costume.

24:14.390 --> 24:15.760
When they had
their costumes off.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.260
Like a secret identity
for a superhero?

24:18.260 --> 24:20.300
Yeah, uh...
pretty much like that,

24:20.300 --> 24:21.680
but for
a supervillain, right?

24:21.680 --> 24:25.050
Henry, he went all the way back
to where the truck was robbed.

24:25.050 --> 24:26.590
You remember that?
Mm-hmm.

24:26.590 --> 24:30.590
Where the truck was robbed?
And he was looking for clues.

24:32.350 --> 24:33.970
(camera shutter clicking)

24:33.970 --> 24:37.590
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

24:42.010 --> 24:44.050
He served in Iraq.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.510
Munitions expert.

24:45.510 --> 24:49.510
LUKELA: Then you can bet
he knows what he's doing.

24:52.970 --> 24:55.590
Let's hope he finds
something.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.930
CSU's come up empty
with the armored car

24:57.930 --> 25:00.720
and the getaway vehicle.

25:03.590 --> 25:05.550
TANI:
Excuse me.

25:08.010 --> 25:08.930
Yeah?

25:08.930 --> 25:12.180
Could you pick this up for me?
Sure.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.550
You think that's part
of the bomb?

25:16.550 --> 25:17.800
Could be. I figure
this is the edge

25:17.800 --> 25:21.970
of the blast radius, based off
the amount of C4 they used,

25:21.970 --> 25:24.220
judging from the
damage it caused.

25:24.220 --> 25:28.680
You can tell all that
just by looking at that truck?

25:29.260 --> 25:33.430
You know, um,
my father served, too.

25:36.930 --> 25:38.640
See any action?

25:38.640 --> 25:40.180
Yeah.

25:40.180 --> 25:42.800
First Gulf War.

25:43.300 --> 25:47.590
But he really...
he didn't like to talk about it.

25:50.350 --> 25:52.640
Listen, um,
I-I just want to say...

25:52.640 --> 25:56.430
I'm really sorry
about what happened to you.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.850
Thanks, but I'm not.

25:57.850 --> 25:58.930
I'd do it again.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.890
Saved a lot of
lives that day.

26:00.890 --> 26:05.470
Truth is, I'd go back
if they'd let me.

26:05.470 --> 26:06.720
Really?

26:06.720 --> 26:08.010
Even after...

26:08.010 --> 26:11.390
You can only lose
your legs once.

26:12.100 --> 26:15.300
Can you look
under that truck for me?

26:21.590 --> 26:24.100
That may have capped the
housing to the explosive.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.590
Plastic's light and
durable enough,

26:25.590 --> 26:27.590
it could be blown clear
without much damage.

26:27.590 --> 26:31.890
Shape it's in, you might
be able to get a print.

26:32.890 --> 26:34.010
Check.

26:34.010 --> 26:37.050
DANNY:
That is a fingerprint.

26:37.050 --> 26:38.720
Whoa.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.640
That's from my finger?

26:39.640 --> 26:42.350
Yeah, that's from your finger.
Check it out.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.590
Here's the thing.

26:44.590 --> 26:46.180
Everybody in the world
has fingerprints.

26:46.180 --> 26:48.180
But that one specific
fingerprint on that glass

26:48.180 --> 26:50.590
could've only come
from one person.

26:50.590 --> 26:52.390
Me?
Yeah, you.

26:52.390 --> 26:53.850
So, basically, if you got

26:53.850 --> 26:55.600
the right technology
and you got a fingerprint,

26:55.600 --> 26:57.970
you'll be able to find
exactly who you're looking for,

26:57.970 --> 26:59.640
'cause you know exactly
who made that print.

26:59.640 --> 27:04.850
So that's how you found the
bad Santa's secret identity.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.890
Yeah.

27:07.550 --> 27:09.590
STEVE: All right, guys,
this is our primary.

27:09.590 --> 27:10.890
His name is James Wendall.

27:10.890 --> 27:14.050
35-year-old Caucasian male,
six-foot-one, medium build,

27:14.050 --> 27:16.390
multiple felony
convictions.

27:16.390 --> 27:17.800
All right?
Now, we know him

27:17.800 --> 27:20.590
as one of our Santas,
but he's ditched his costume.

27:20.590 --> 27:24.260
Jerry's gonna send this picture
to all of our phones.

27:24.260 --> 27:26.590
Uh, my phone don't do pictures.

27:26.590 --> 27:28.390
Don't worry about it, Frank.
It's all right.

27:28.390 --> 27:29.680
We're gonna be breaking up
into teams.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.050
All right, Reggie,
you're gonna go with Junior.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.260
Josie, you're going with Adam.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.220
Hey, Josie.
Adam Noshimuri.

27:36.220 --> 27:37.010
Hey. You Five-O?

27:37.010 --> 27:38.600
No, just a guy
who has a habit of being

27:38.600 --> 27:39.800
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.850
STEVE:
And, Frank, you're gonna
be with me, okay?

27:41.850 --> 27:43.600
Yes, sir.
You're gonna show me

27:43.600 --> 27:45.720
every nook and cranny
of this mall. All right?

27:45.720 --> 27:47.850
Every alcove,
every janitor's closet,

27:47.850 --> 27:50.890
every secret little cubbyhole
that you and your boys ever

27:50.890 --> 27:52.260
snuck a smoke break in.

27:52.260 --> 27:53.140
All right?

27:53.140 --> 27:53.640
Done.
Good.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.890
These guys may have
ditched their costumes,

27:55.890 --> 27:56.970
but they have not
ditched their weapons.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.930
Especially Wendall. He's armed.
He's extremely dangerous.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.720
So under no circumstances
should you engage.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.550
If you guys get a
visual on this guy,

28:04.550 --> 28:06.680
you let me know, and
Five-O handles it.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.050
Everybody clear?
Understood, Commander.

28:08.050 --> 28:09.850
All right,
let's move out.

28:12.350 --> 28:13.590
Okay, so now
the search was on.

28:13.590 --> 28:15.050
Right? Now that
the good guys knew

28:15.050 --> 28:16.260
exactly what
the bad Santa looked like

28:16.260 --> 28:18.590
with the costume off,
Uncle Steve and all the angels,

28:18.590 --> 28:19.600
they were ready
to search the entire mall.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.760
Meanwhile, Kekoa and Jerry were
checking their naughty list

28:22.760 --> 28:24.760
to make sure no bad guys
had left the mall.

28:24.760 --> 28:29.050
But the Santas had one more
trick up their sleeves.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.100
Josie.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.350
Is that blood?

28:40.470 --> 28:42.050
Yeah, it's dried.

28:42.050 --> 28:43.590
But only recently.

28:43.590 --> 28:45.300
(distant banging)

28:45.300 --> 28:47.260
ADAM:
Wait. You hear that?

28:50.350 --> 28:53.220
(men groaning)

28:53.220 --> 28:54.590
(banging)

28:54.590 --> 28:58.680
(groaning and banging continue)

29:03.850 --> 29:06.590
(muffled groaning)

29:07.050 --> 29:07.720
(cell phone rings)

29:07.720 --> 29:09.260
STEVE:
Adam, what do you got?

29:09.260 --> 29:11.800
We just found two men tied up
in a janitor's closet.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.260
Turns out they work here
at the mall as Santas.

29:14.260 --> 29:15.470
They just told us
they were on break

29:15.470 --> 29:16.590
when they were approached
by two guys

29:16.590 --> 29:19.590
and forced at gunpoint
to hand over their costumes.

29:19.590 --> 29:22.590
Wait a minute, you telling me
that the costumes we found

29:22.590 --> 29:25.760
in that dressing room
were put there to throw us off?

29:25.760 --> 29:26.590
Which means our suspects

29:26.590 --> 29:29.590
are most likely
still dressed as Santas.

29:31.590 --> 29:34.510
Right in the camera there,
Santy Claus.

29:37.590 --> 29:38.550
He's good.

29:38.550 --> 29:41.550
Okay, Jon Banks,
you're good to go.

29:41.550 --> 29:45.970
Don't forget to put
me on the nice list.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.100
Merry Christmas.

29:53.890 --> 29:56.350
All right, looks good.
Looks like, uh, Santa's reindeer

29:56.350 --> 29:58.140
are just about
to leave the West Coast.

29:58.140 --> 29:59.760
Which means
we'd better get going.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.590
Because if he gets here
and we are not asleep,

30:02.590 --> 30:03.470
what's gonna happen?

30:03.470 --> 30:04.800
He won't bring me
any more presents.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.590
Yeah, that's right, but-but we
don't have to worry about that

30:07.590 --> 30:11.350
because the story is coming
to a close very soon, okay?

30:11.350 --> 30:14.510
What happened to the bad Santas?
Did they get away?

30:14.510 --> 30:15.680
Well, kind of.
Yes and no.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.390
You see, 'cause Steve had called
down to the checkpoint,

30:18.390 --> 30:20.760
and he said, "Do not,
under any circumstances,

30:20.760 --> 30:23.600
let any of those Santa Clauses
get through the checkpoint."

30:23.600 --> 30:25.680
But they had already kind of
let somebody through.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.600
Right?
But then they realized

30:26.600 --> 30:29.180
their mistake right away,
so it was okay.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.590
Hey! Hey, Santy Claus.

30:34.590 --> 30:37.510
Come here. Let me talk
to you for a second.

30:40.590 --> 30:43.590
Ah, big mistake, pal.

30:44.850 --> 30:47.430
Santa's on the move.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.680
(man grunting)

30:54.970 --> 30:57.430
(grunting)

30:57.590 --> 30:59.050
CHARLIE:What about the person

30:59.050 --> 31:00.930
that got pushed to the ground?
Were they okay?

31:00.930 --> 31:03.350
Yeah, they were okay.
That's a very good question.

31:03.350 --> 31:05.890
The reason they were okay
is 'cause one of the angels

31:05.890 --> 31:09.590
was an expert
in dealing with injuries.

31:09.590 --> 31:10.720
(groaning softly)

31:10.720 --> 31:12.140
You're gonna be okay, sir.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.430
It's my shoulder.

31:13.430 --> 31:15.390
Yeah, it's dislocated.
(groans)

31:15.390 --> 31:16.590
Are you sure?

31:16.590 --> 31:18.430
Listen, I was a medic
with the Marines.

31:18.430 --> 31:20.140
Which means I've heard
every cuss word

31:20.140 --> 31:21.590
you can think of.
Used 'em all, too.

31:21.590 --> 31:24.800
So don't feel the need
to hold back on my account.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.850
What are you talking...?

31:25.850 --> 31:27.590
(loud crunch)
(yells in pain)

31:27.590 --> 31:29.590
(whimpering)

31:29.590 --> 31:31.140
What about the
other Santa?

31:31.140 --> 31:33.100
Was he still hiding
in the mall?

31:33.100 --> 31:33.850
He was hiding in the mall.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.680
And Uncle Steve was sick
and tired of chasing the guy,

31:36.680 --> 31:37.890
so he decided to call him.

31:37.890 --> 31:40.350
How does he know
his phone number?

31:40.350 --> 31:41.970
He didn't need
his phone number

31:41.970 --> 31:46.010
'cause he used
a different form of calling.

31:47.470 --> 31:51.180
(bell chiming)
STEVE (over P.A.):
James Wendall...

31:51.180 --> 31:52.140
we have your partner.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.850
We've evacuated the mall
and have it surrounded.

31:54.850 --> 31:57.550
Your only option
is to surrender.

31:57.590 --> 32:00.430
Show yourself with your hands
raised above your head.

32:00.430 --> 32:01.930
You got 60 seconds.

32:01.930 --> 32:04.470
(bell chimes)

32:11.680 --> 32:13.050
JERRY:Guys, I got eyes on Santa.

32:13.050 --> 32:16.590
Repeat-- target spotted,
heading west on level two.

32:19.010 --> 32:22.930
Suspect now ducking into the
stairwell on the southwest side.

32:22.930 --> 32:25.590
I got no coverage in there.

32:25.590 --> 32:26.300
Southwest stairwell.

32:26.300 --> 32:27.590
You know where
he's going?

32:27.590 --> 32:28.970
That stairwell's
got roof access.

32:28.970 --> 32:32.100
From there, it's a short jump
over to the top level

32:32.100 --> 32:33.800
of the parking garage
next door.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.680
Can you get me to
that stairwell?

32:35.680 --> 32:36.800
I can do better than that.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.590
I know a shortcut
that'll put you

32:38.590 --> 32:41.180
on that roof a lot faster.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.260
Steve was really lucky.

32:43.260 --> 32:44.970
He was really lucky that Frank

32:44.970 --> 32:46.050
knew the mall so well.

32:46.050 --> 32:47.180
But they had one
little problem

32:47.180 --> 32:48.390
'cause they had
to use a shortcut,

32:48.390 --> 32:50.590
and at the end of that shortcut,
there was an elevator

32:50.590 --> 32:52.930
that they had to use,
and the elevator had been locked

32:52.930 --> 32:55.470
from before, when they had
to evacuate the mall.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.640
Could they take
a different shortcut?

32:57.640 --> 32:59.260
There was no other shortcuts.

32:59.260 --> 33:00.140
They didn't have time.

33:00.140 --> 33:03.140
Danno, the bad guys
are gonna get away.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.930
Well, they might have,
but the angels

33:04.930 --> 33:07.300
had one more miracle left.
You remember Reggie?

33:07.300 --> 33:08.930
The man with
the metal arm?

33:08.930 --> 33:10.800
That's right.
Reggie with the metal arm.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.510
You're not gonna believe
what this guy was able

33:13.510 --> 33:14.890
to do with that arm.

33:20.180 --> 33:22.510
(metallic creaking)

33:32.590 --> 33:34.050
Thanks, Reggie.

33:34.050 --> 33:36.590
Go get 'em, Commander.

33:39.010 --> 33:41.600
Did Uncle Steve catch up
to the bad guys?

33:41.600 --> 33:42.140
He did.

33:42.140 --> 33:46.850
But, unfortunately, the bad guy
was there waiting for him.

33:51.550 --> 33:55.180
DANNY:You see, the bad guy knew
that Uncle Steve was coming,

33:55.180 --> 33:57.260
and he wanted to be ready.

34:01.590 --> 34:02.680
Buddy?

34:02.680 --> 34:04.260
I'm coming under there.

34:04.260 --> 34:07.050
Hey. What are you doing
under here, buddy?

34:07.050 --> 34:11.510
I'm scared the bad guys
are gonna get Uncle Steve.

34:11.510 --> 34:12.470
Let me ask you
a question.

34:12.470 --> 34:14.850
You think I would tell you
a story that's got miracles

34:14.850 --> 34:17.220
and angels that doesn't have
a happy ending?

34:17.220 --> 34:18.760
No.
All right, then.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.680
So, can we get out of here?

34:20.680 --> 34:22.050
No.

34:22.050 --> 34:24.050
Well, we can stay here
if you want.

34:24.050 --> 34:26.760
We can finish the story
under here.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.760
That what you want?

34:28.760 --> 34:30.590
Yes.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.510
What happened next?

34:32.510 --> 34:34.510
Well, Steve and the bad guy,
they started to talk.

34:34.510 --> 34:36.590
And talk and talk and talk.
You know Uncle Steve--

34:36.590 --> 34:38.260
he likes to talk
and talk and talk

34:38.260 --> 34:39.180
and talk until
he gets his way?

34:39.180 --> 34:41.800
No.
Well, that's...
that's how he is.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.260
He likes to argue.
He loves to argue.

34:43.260 --> 34:45.470
He's never met an argument
he didn't like.

34:45.470 --> 34:47.640
So he started arguing
with this bad guy.

34:47.640 --> 34:49.590
And he started
talking so much,

34:49.590 --> 34:50.970
so much that the bad guy
got so bored

34:50.970 --> 34:54.590
listening to Steve's big mouth
that he just fell right asleep.

34:54.590 --> 34:56.800
(imitates snoring)
(gunshot)

35:05.930 --> 35:08.300
(takes deep breath)

35:08.300 --> 35:09.680
The end.

35:09.680 --> 35:10.300
See?

35:10.300 --> 35:11.930
Told you-- it wasn't
so scary, was it?

35:11.930 --> 35:14.800
Danno, why do people
do bad things?

35:14.800 --> 35:16.300
(inhales deeply)

35:16.300 --> 35:18.470
Well, I don't know, buddy.
That's a good question.

35:18.470 --> 35:21.590
I mean, I guess just, uh,
there's some people out there

35:21.590 --> 35:24.590
that kind of...
they're kind of bad.

35:24.590 --> 35:27.930
You know? But there's also
really, really good people.

35:27.930 --> 35:29.140
And in this story,

35:29.140 --> 35:32.590
some of the good people,
they all got together.

35:32.590 --> 35:36.390
♪ Just hear those sleigh bells
ring-a-ling... ♪

35:36.390 --> 35:37.800
DOG:
Who's a good boy?

35:37.800 --> 35:38.760
Eddie's a good boy.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.590
He's a good boy.
(smacking lips)

35:41.590 --> 35:42.640
Aw, yeah.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.010
Don't bite.

35:44.010 --> 35:45.590
Sucker. Aw...

35:45.720 --> 35:48.760
(chuckling):
Please don't tell anybody this.

35:48.760 --> 35:49.640
Mm-hmm.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.600
Making out with my dog there?

35:51.600 --> 35:53.010
Yeah, you
want kisses?

35:53.010 --> 35:54.430
Merry Christmas, buddy.

35:54.430 --> 35:56.590
Merry Christmas,
brother.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.720
How you guys doing?
Doing good.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.470
You're good?
You good for drinks?

36:01.470 --> 36:02.640
All set.
All right, good.

36:02.640 --> 36:03.590
Good, good, good.

36:03.590 --> 36:04.720
Noelani, you look nice.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.590
Oh, thank you, Commander.

36:05.590 --> 36:07.590
Oh, it's like a little
Christmas gift.

36:07.590 --> 36:08.600
Yeah. I like your hat,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.590
but I think you forgot
the rest of the costume.

36:10.590 --> 36:13.590
I'm pretty sure Steve's seen
enough Santa Claus costumes

36:13.590 --> 36:14.550
for one day.
Thank you.

36:14.550 --> 36:16.510
Thank you, Duke.
Yeah, I think I will be leaving

36:16.510 --> 36:20.300
those honors to somebody else
later on in the night.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.590
NOELANI:
Time to suit up,
big guy.

36:22.590 --> 36:25.010
KAMEKONA:
Anything for thekeikis.

36:25.010 --> 36:27.590
Showtime, cuz.

36:31.050 --> 36:32.430
Yo.
I'm going in.

36:32.430 --> 36:34.220
Okay, buddy.
What's up? Hey.

36:34.220 --> 36:34.760
I got a favor to ask.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.010
Uh, you know, last year,
the guy that, uh, came over

36:37.010 --> 36:38.930
and did the chimney
Santa thing for Charlie?
Yeah.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.260
You remember?
Yeah, you asking if I can

36:40.260 --> 36:42.930
get him to come back out again?
I know it's last minute,

36:42.930 --> 36:44.100
but...
No, don't worry.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.100
Yeah?
If he can't swing by,

36:46.100 --> 36:47.930
I'm sure I can find someone.

36:47.930 --> 36:49.590
My man.

36:49.590 --> 36:50.220
Thank you.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.720
STEVE: Hey, excuse me,
everybody. Uh...

36:52.720 --> 36:55.100
Um, hey, come on in here
a little...

36:55.100 --> 36:57.510
Yeah, come on in, guys.
Grab your drinks.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.930
Hey, listen, I just want
to thank all you guys

36:59.930 --> 37:01.550
for coming out tonight.

37:01.550 --> 37:02.590
Okay? It means a lot to me.

37:02.590 --> 37:04.930
And, uh, look, if we look
around the room right now,

37:04.930 --> 37:06.930
there's a lot
of familiar faces in here.

37:06.930 --> 37:10.590
But also gonna see a bunch
of new faces, okay?

37:10.590 --> 37:13.590
And to the first-timers
at the, uh, famous

37:13.590 --> 37:16.590
Steve and Eddie McGarrett's
Christmas Bash,

37:16.590 --> 37:18.550
(whimpers)
on behalf of all of us,

37:18.550 --> 37:20.470
our deepest gratitude
to you guys.

37:20.470 --> 37:21.930
Not just for
what happened today,

37:21.930 --> 37:24.350
but for all of your
personal sacrifices--

37:24.350 --> 37:27.010
all right, defending
this country that we all love.

37:27.010 --> 37:27.930
So thank you very much.

37:27.930 --> 37:31.640
It's our honor
to call you guys'ohananow.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.350
So welcome, and merry Christmas.

37:34.350 --> 37:35.590
GROVER:
Hear, hear.

37:35.590 --> 37:37.260
And another beer.

37:37.260 --> 37:39.800
All right.
(partygoers murmuring)

37:40.550 --> 37:41.590
Commander.
Hmm?

37:41.590 --> 37:43.600
Hey, thank you for that.
No, Junior.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.930
Thank you, buddy.
If you hadn't

37:44.930 --> 37:45.890
have showed that
initiative today,

37:45.890 --> 37:47.850
we probably wouldn't have
caught those bad guys.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.970
I'm always happy
to lend a hand.

37:49.970 --> 37:50.600
Yeah, I know you are.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.550
That's why I got
a little something for you.

37:53.550 --> 37:54.100
I-I'm sorry.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.930
I didn't realize
we were exchanging gifts.

37:55.930 --> 37:57.720
No, we're not. It's not a gift.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.470
A gift is, uh...
a gift's charity.

38:00.470 --> 38:03.300
This is something
you earn.

38:04.010 --> 38:05.470
(chuckles)

38:05.470 --> 38:06.720
Oh, for real?

38:06.720 --> 38:08.590
No, I'm kidding.
What do you think?

38:08.590 --> 38:10.760
Yeah, for real.
Come on.

38:13.470 --> 38:14.180
But, um... HPD training--

38:14.180 --> 38:16.760
I-I haven't finished
the course yet.
You didn't finish...?

38:16.760 --> 38:18.220
Thought you guys
told me he...

38:18.220 --> 38:21.180
he finished the course.
This is... Come on.

38:21.180 --> 38:24.180
Listen, you will finish
the course, all right?

38:24.180 --> 38:25.890
But over the last
couple of months,

38:25.890 --> 38:28.050
you've proven to me,
you've proven to all of us

38:28.050 --> 38:29.590
that you're more
than ready for that.

38:29.590 --> 38:33.050
So merry Christmas
and welcome aboard.
Thank you, sir.

38:33.050 --> 38:34.890
(whooping, clapping)

38:34.890 --> 38:37.140
Junior!

38:38.590 --> 38:40.220
Hey, man. It's heavier
than you thought

38:40.220 --> 38:41.350
it was gonna be, isn't it?

38:41.350 --> 38:44.100
(laughing):
Yeah, it is, it is.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.220
STEVE:
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

38:45.220 --> 38:47.720
Welcome to Five-O.
Oh, thank you.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.010
(chuckles)
Congratulations
there, kiddo.

38:50.010 --> 38:52.590
Thank you, Captain.
You know you ain't
getting paid, right?

38:52.590 --> 38:54.510
(laughing): No.
Okay, long as you know.

38:54.510 --> 38:56.300
(indistinct chatter)

38:56.300 --> 38:57.850
DANNY:
Congratulations, my guy.

38:57.850 --> 38:59.260
Thanks, man.

38:59.260 --> 39:01.260
Thank you.

39:07.180 --> 39:08.680
And there you have it.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.590
Happy ending,
just like I promised, right?

39:38.590 --> 39:41.220
STEVE:
Yo, why you gotta
hold out on me

39:41.220 --> 39:42.890
with these cookies?

39:42.890 --> 39:44.180
Why wouldn't you
tell me about these?

39:44.180 --> 39:46.590
These are shockingly good.
You don't tell me about these?

39:46.590 --> 39:47.850
I don't know why
that's shocking.

39:47.850 --> 39:48.640
I'm a fantastic baker.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.430
You bake these?
Yeah, I baked those.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.890
Do me a favor--
next time you steal, just...

39:52.890 --> 39:55.100
Wait, wait, wait.
What'd you just say? "Steal"?

39:55.100 --> 39:56.930
I didn't steal anything.
You didn't?

39:56.930 --> 39:57.890
They're sitting right there.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.720
For Santa Claus.
They're sitting right there

39:59.720 --> 40:01.850
for Santa Claus, not for you.

40:01.850 --> 40:03.260
Okay?

40:03.590 --> 40:05.550
I hope you're proud of
yourself. You stole cookies

40:05.550 --> 40:06.800
from Santa Claus, animal.
Okay, all right.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.140
Let me... let me explain
something to you.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.590
All right?
Please, explain
something to me,

40:09.590 --> 40:11.140
because I need things
explained to me.

40:11.140 --> 40:12.590
If Santa Claus...
Uh-huh.

40:12.590 --> 40:13.800
...got his big,
fat sausage fingers

40:13.800 --> 40:15.010
on these cookies,
that means

40:15.010 --> 40:16.590
he would be guilty
of a home invasion.

40:16.590 --> 40:17.720
You ever think about that?
What about you?

40:17.720 --> 40:19.300
You just broke into my house.
Did you think about that?

40:19.300 --> 40:21.430
No, I didn't think about it, but
you just broke into my house.

40:21.430 --> 40:23.350
No, I didn't break
into your house.
Yes, you did.

40:23.350 --> 40:25.140
I used the key
that's behind the rock

40:25.140 --> 40:26.600
that you leave outside
behind the rock

40:26.600 --> 40:28.220
that you put there
for emergencies.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.300
What's the emergency?

40:30.300 --> 40:32.930
(sighs)
I needed some cookies.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.390
Uh-huh.

40:35.390 --> 40:37.510
Now I'm eating
cookies.

40:37.510 --> 40:38.470
What are you doing?

40:38.470 --> 40:39.930
I can't have one
of my cookies?

40:39.930 --> 40:41.930
Yes, you can.
You can have the top cookie.

40:41.930 --> 40:42.800
No, now that you
touched it...

40:42.800 --> 40:45.100
I didn't touch it.
I'm touching the bottom cookie.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.220
Your finger is on a
piece of this...

40:46.220 --> 40:49.300
It literally...
It doesn't even matter.
The truth of the matter

40:49.300 --> 40:50.470
is I have a whole tray
of cookies

40:50.470 --> 40:52.260
that I can have
for myself with my own milk.

40:52.260 --> 40:53.590
Where are they?
In the kitchen.

40:53.590 --> 40:54.590
Go get 'em.
I'm gonna.

40:54.590 --> 40:56.100
Good, Grinch.
I'm... I'm a Grinch?

40:56.100 --> 40:58.430
You're kind of Grinchy.
You're a gorilla.
