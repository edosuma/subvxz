WEBVTT

00:12.679 --> 00:15.098
Mom? Mom, are you there?

00:18.601 --> 00:20.270
I'm here. What's up?

00:20.353 --> 00:22.689
Alta says breakfast is ready.

00:22.772 --> 00:23.732
Yeah…

00:24.983 --> 00:26.943
You go ahead. I'll be down in a minute.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.533
Morning.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.369
Let's go. You go that way.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.955
Jump from the balcony.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.416
I'm their father.
Who cares if they see me?

00:41.499 --> 00:43.126
I don't care. This was a mistake.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.170
Yeah, a wonderful mistake.

00:45.837 --> 00:46.921
Don't get this wrong.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.174
We were drunk and nostalgic. Hurry up!

01:02.479 --> 01:04.731
Juan Carlos, why are you here so early

01:04.814 --> 01:07.150
and wearing the suit you wore at the prom?

01:07.233 --> 01:10.487
I wanted to have breakfast with the kids,
and I'm out of clean clothes.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.696
My washing machine broke.

01:12.489 --> 01:16.034
That's the oldest excuse
in the book, Juan Carlos.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.702
Shall we go in?

01:17.786 --> 01:18.620
Yeah.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.665
Good morning!

01:23.166 --> 01:24.084
Surprise!

01:24.584 --> 01:26.252
Your dad came to have breakfast

01:26.336 --> 01:29.172
and to use the washing machine.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.132
Kids, no whispering at the table.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.927
I missed this so much!

01:34.010 --> 01:35.595
Last night was fun, huh?

01:35.678 --> 01:36.930
Thank you, Alta.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.473
Ceci, what about that boy?

01:38.556 --> 01:40.850
His name is Darío.
We're officially dating.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.477
That seems quick.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.313
We could invite him over
for dinner, right?

01:45.396 --> 01:47.732
Juan Carlos, do me a favor.

01:47.816 --> 01:51.361
Let's go talk outside.
Bring your juice. Come on.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.904
<i>Your mom saw me. What can I do?</i>

01:52.987 --> 01:55.698
Let's just tell them
their parents are back together.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.492
We're not back together.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.202
It was the booze.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.995
Ana, we love each other.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.165
We've been married 20 years.
Of course we love each other.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.086
I need to be alone to think. I need space.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.589
We should only see each other
during couples counseling.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.843
Dancing to our song last night,
it dawned on me.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.511
You still love me, Ana.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.429
Oh please. Goodbye.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.730
A NETFLIX SERIES

03:28.541 --> 03:29.834
How was your Sunday?

03:31.544 --> 03:34.422
Juan Carlos spent the night
after the graduation party.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.258
So you're not mad at him anymore?

03:37.342 --> 03:38.551
He's a liar.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.970
After all those lies,
I simply can't trust him.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.013
I get it.

03:42.513 --> 03:46.100
Trusting again is very hard.
It happened to me with Pablo.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.644
I'm so glad you're here.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.520
I missed my friend.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.105
I missed you too.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.192
But I really miss Valentina.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.236
How about a playdate?

03:56.319 --> 03:57.862
Are you free tomorrow night?

03:57.946 --> 04:01.449
We're having a brainstorming session
for the app's slogan.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.117
We need it done this week.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.870
I'm on it. Don't worry.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.288
<i>Don't be mad, okay?</i>

04:08.831 --> 04:12.168
<i>Rorros is a spa concept for gentlemen.</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:14.754
<i>I came up with the idea</i>
<i>while in the sauna.</i>

04:14.837 --> 04:18.883
<i>Men need a quality service</i>
<i>that is also quick.</i>

04:18.967 --> 04:22.428
Quick? Not as quick as you
taking credit for my idea.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.846
What the hell?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.057
First, he makes us switch locations,

04:26.140 --> 04:27.725
then he steals my concept.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.853
What's next?
Him treating us like employees?

04:30.937 --> 04:33.690
He's a guy.
He likes to puff out his chest.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.358
What an asshole!

04:36.359 --> 04:37.735
Look on the bright side.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.697
He got us 600 paying customers.

04:47.912 --> 04:48.830
It's a nightmare.

04:48.913 --> 04:49.914
DANCE CONTEST

04:50.999 --> 04:54.252
Ro, why on earth did you sign up
for a dance contest?

04:54.335 --> 04:55.503
You have no rhythm.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.047
I play the recorder.
It's almost the same thing.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.052
No. Total lack of rhythm
is a social disease.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.846
It's incurable and deadly.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.472
No.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.600
-Everyone can dance.
-Everyone but you.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.020
Believe it or not,

05:12.103 --> 05:14.397
I studied jazz,

05:14.480 --> 05:17.483
folk dance, ballet, and even disco.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.031
I can do your choreography
in the blink of an eye.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.949
I taught my friends how to dance.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.535
The only one I couldn't teach is your mom.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.162
She's a lost cause.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.747
Fine, you're hired, Grandma.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.999
-Now, both of you, out of my room.
-What?

05:33.082 --> 05:36.377
-But…
-We should practice-- Ro!

05:37.045 --> 05:40.256
Isn't it weird

05:40.340 --> 05:42.216
Ro wants to do something so suicidal?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.552
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

05:44.635 --> 05:47.889
We can create synergies
for your app with other coworkers

05:47.972 --> 05:49.891
who also focus on women.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.727
That's great.
I told you you'd love working here.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.189
Oh, my boss is here.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.524
Get used to the Ferrán effect.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.329
-Ferrán!
-Dora.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.207
This is Ana,
the new partner I told you about.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.127
-Nice to meet you, Ana.
-Likewise.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.962
Sorry I haven't been around.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.549
I like welcoming people myself.
I was in Chicago for my niece's birth.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.929
This is Cynthia, my marketing director.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.723
Hi. You have great taste.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.974
May I?

06:32.058 --> 06:32.934
Sure.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.603
I'm going to finish setting up.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.521
Yeah.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.730
I'll give you a hand.

06:39.941 --> 06:43.027
Ana, I'd love to get coffee
and hear all about

06:43.111 --> 06:46.239
how you became
so successful at such a young age.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.536
Actually, I'm not as young as I look.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.747
Still, I'd love to get coffee.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.706
All right.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.417
Oh.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.461
Excuse me. I have to take this.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.421
Go right ahead.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.839
What's up, sweetie?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.508
I have a dance contest on Friday.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.176
Dance contest? That's weird.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.804
I mean, great.
I didn't know you like dancing.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.639
<i>What song did you choose?</i>

07:11.722 --> 07:13.766
It's a surprise. Are you coming?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.269
Of course. I'll be there.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.186
See you.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.149
What's up, champ?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.358
Is everything okay?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.819
Yeah, I'm great. I'm in a dance contest.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.737
You must come. I sent you an invite.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.364
<i>Sure, count me in.</i>

07:28.448 --> 07:30.324
<i>Out of curiosity,</i>

07:30.867 --> 07:32.285
<i>since when do you dance?</i>

07:32.785 --> 07:34.203
I'm working on it, Dad. Bye!

07:35.413 --> 07:36.664
<i>You must be joking.</i>

07:39.709 --> 07:41.294
Car supremacist!

07:46.507 --> 07:47.467
Bring it on!

07:48.968 --> 07:50.887
I see you've been practicing.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.181
Well, I have a console here.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.682
How's your game going?

07:54.765 --> 07:58.519
I'm pitching it to an animation studio,
but I can't seem to finish the demo.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.522
With Manolo in the office,
I can't work on it.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.065
What about at home?

08:08.571 --> 08:09.739
Oops.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.659
-They've shut down my render ten times.
-You need a workspace.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.495
And I have just the place.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.539
<i>Now we're talking! Free beer and foosball!</i>

08:18.623 --> 08:20.041
This is awesome, dude!

08:20.124 --> 08:22.210
It's just for employees.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.212
-You're a guest.
-Here's your studio.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.883
-Nice going, man!
-Nice.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.801
It looks so professional, man!

08:30.885 --> 08:32.470
I can't accept this.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.847
Why the hell not? They have foosball!

08:34.931 --> 08:36.432
The rent must be so high.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.185
I rent this place
while my office is being remodeled.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.646
I'll hardly be here.
It shouldn't go to waste.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.147
It would be a shame, man.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.358
Fine, only until I finish the demo.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.445
Juan Carlos?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.907
The missus is here, guys!

08:53.741 --> 08:54.951
What are you doing here?

08:55.034 --> 08:58.955
My office is being remodeled.
The noise is unbearable.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.831
You couldn't find another place?

09:00.915 --> 09:03.709
How about a coffee shop or your apartment?

09:03.793 --> 09:06.170
Maybe one of the thousand
other co-work spaces?

09:06.254 --> 09:09.215
I really like this one.
It's perfect for networking.

09:09.298 --> 09:12.009
Networking? Your company sells screws.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.347
Are you angry
because we're office neighbors,

09:16.430 --> 09:18.432
or are you just playing hard to get?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.810
I asked you
to only see each other at therapy,

09:20.893 --> 09:23.437
and now you're here, invading my space.

09:23.521 --> 09:24.730
You're right. I'm sorry.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.065
Sorry, don't be mad.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.820
I promise I won't come much.
I'll leave when my office is done, okay?

09:30.903 --> 09:32.405
<i>What space? I don't get it.</i>

09:33.197 --> 09:34.031
This one.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.201
That's Ferrán's car.
It's his parking spot.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.662
So where can I find this Ferrán person?

09:39.745 --> 09:42.832
He is in office 831,
but you need an appointment.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.835
He's cool, progressive, charming,
but he's also very busy.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.797
Well, I just want to thank him
for a gift he left on my bicycle.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.216
Lucky you!

09:52.300 --> 09:53.259
Thanks.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
Yes, we'll do that. All right.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.102
You thought you'd get away with it?

10:03.603 --> 10:06.439
-Damn, guys, come.
-I can't believe you didn't care.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.648
I'll call you back.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.067
You're a car supremacist and a douche

10:10.151 --> 10:12.278
who drove away after hitting my bicycle.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.904
I can't use it now.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.740
-Look what you did.
-No, I--

10:15.823 --> 10:19.201
You could've at least
left me a note with your number.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.620
-Well--
-You know what?

10:20.703 --> 10:24.707
I hope your car isn't keyed
mysteriously one of these days.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.756
That was a clear example
of sexual tension.

10:32.506 --> 10:35.259
Dude, have you told Mariana
you'll be working here?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.385
No.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.390
Mariana.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.517
What are you doing here?

10:43.601 --> 10:46.520
Juan Carlos offered me a space
to work on my demo right here.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.397
A little obvious, right?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.233
I know. Ana nearly killed him
when she saw him.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.986
I'll come in my free time or on weekends.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.155
Yeah, no problem. Do what you have to do.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.450
-I should…
-Yeah, no worries.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.582
Hey! What are you doing here?

11:07.375 --> 11:09.210
I work here with Ana.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.878
You didn't get fired, did you?

11:10.961 --> 11:12.088
No, I quit.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.840
I'm the marketing director for the app.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.176
You'll do a great job. You're amazing.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.223
Cynthia, about the other day…

11:22.807 --> 11:25.434
That's all in the past. We're cool.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.937
So can we stay friends?

11:30.481 --> 11:31.524
Sure.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.236
Well, I should get back to work.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.153
Sure.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.614
<i>Are you ready?</i>

11:38.698 --> 11:39.949
I'll play the song.

11:40.908 --> 11:44.161
-Alexa, play "Can't Take My Eyes--"
-No, I'll choose the music.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.705
Alexa, play "The Fire."

11:55.005 --> 11:57.341
Well, I never learned
those particular moves.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.010
Alexa, stop!

12:00.094 --> 12:01.429
<i>Twerking stopped.</i>

12:01.512 --> 12:03.347
I'm not teaching my brother how to twerk.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.599
Plus, we agreed I'd choose the song.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.935
You're my boyfriend.
You do as I say, period.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.270
But--

12:09.353 --> 12:12.106
I'm not arguing in front of your grandma.
I'm leaving.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.779
-Ro--
-Paloma is kind of--

12:18.863 --> 12:19.864
Slutty.

12:19.947 --> 12:20.823
And bossy.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.534
<i>Here's a question.</i>

12:23.617 --> 12:27.246
Why did you paint the salon pink?
We didn't agree to that.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.374
We didn't agree
that you'd take all the credit either.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.918
It's reassuring for men
to hear it was a guy's idea.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.795
<i>It's a marketing tool.</i>

12:34.879 --> 12:36.797
You sound like a tool.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.633
Since renting the new place,
you call all the shots.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.676
<i>You don't trust me.</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:44.054
I wanted to use leftover paint
from Juan Carlos's office.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.974
-Besides, it's a manly color.
-My opinion doesn't count?

12:47.057 --> 12:49.518
<i>Yeah, but we each</i>
<i>contribute our strengths.</i>

12:49.602 --> 12:52.271
You're a beauty expert,
but I know marketing.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.898
I also have good taste.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.942
So now I have bad taste?

12:57.026 --> 13:00.321
I'm just messing around.
You're a little high-strung today.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.406
I might be high-strung or whatever,

13:02.490 --> 13:04.617
but at least I don't depend on my brother.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.411
Partnering up was a bad idea. Goodbye.

13:10.706 --> 13:11.707
She'll get over it.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.750
Trust me.

13:14.710 --> 13:15.836
A peace offering.

13:16.754 --> 13:17.671
It's calming tea.

13:18.672 --> 13:19.548
Thanks.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.551
You look 20 years younger.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.013
Careful!

13:26.680 --> 13:29.558
One of the kids that work here
could fall in love with you.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.526
You know what?

13:39.276 --> 13:40.861
Let's put it to the test.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.624
Mind if I try?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.334
Not at all. Come.

13:56.043 --> 13:56.919
Please.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.052
Wow!

14:05.553 --> 14:07.096
Isn't the gentleman playing?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.307
No.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.810
The gentleman just brings me my tea.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.145
You're good.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.189
I'm good at everything I do.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.649
Oh.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.611
Did you know the way we play

14:23.612 --> 14:24.738
says a lot about us?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.240
Is that so?

14:27.908 --> 14:30.661
It can help determine
whether we're cautious

14:31.787 --> 14:34.081
or risk-takers,

14:35.207 --> 14:37.167
aiming straight for the bull's-eye.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.591
Look, Ana,

14:44.216 --> 14:45.718
you may not take me seriously,

14:46.594 --> 14:48.304
but I don't like playing some games.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.598
That's too bad.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.975
This one was so much fun.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.445
Why are you so nervous?
Is it because you saw Mariana?

15:04.945 --> 15:07.781
-Or because you saw her with that hunk?
-Hunk?

15:09.033 --> 15:10.993
He's a Greek god.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.705
Like the spawn of Zeus himself.
Gorgeous guy.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.998
You're crazy.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.042
Besides, we're over.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.836
Maybe you're not over her.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.883
ARE YOU OVER YOUR EX?
START

15:25.966 --> 15:28.928
Dude, those tests only work
in those soap operas you like.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.056
Come on, dude. I don't watch soaps.

15:32.139 --> 15:32.973
You don't?

15:33.057 --> 15:35.851
-Fine, only to fall asleep.
-Right.

15:35.935 --> 15:40.773
Besides, if you're so sure,
you should pass the test easily, right?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.191
How about a bet?

15:45.903 --> 15:47.488
I'M SORRY!
"THE CAR SUPREMACIST"

15:51.825 --> 15:53.035
Miss,

15:53.118 --> 15:55.996
you should park your bicycle
in the designated area next time.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.792
-And where's the designated bike area?
-Over there.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.092
<i>Don't take this the wrong way,</i>

16:08.175 --> 16:10.552
but it's not right for Paloma
to change your plans.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.346
Can I be honest?

16:12.429 --> 16:13.931
You're tired of carrying her bag?

16:14.515 --> 16:16.100
This is why I signed up for it.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.521
Are those our parents?

16:21.397 --> 16:22.564
I don't believe it!

16:23.482 --> 16:25.776
I had forgotten that!

16:27.152 --> 16:30.114
Your mom was mad because
she couldn't follow my choreography.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.160
That song, really?

16:36.078 --> 16:38.497
I want them to remember
how they felt back then,

16:39.164 --> 16:40.624
so they'll get back together.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.377
All right.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.921
I'll help you with the choreography,

16:46.422 --> 16:48.966
but you can't force Paloma
to dance with you.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.928
Do you think if I explain my reasons,
she'll agree to the song?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.265
Tell her why this is so important for you.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.309
Love is about support.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.479
If she doesn't agree,
tell her she's a bad girlfriend.

17:03.063 --> 17:03.897
Seriously, Ro.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.653
<i>I bet you didn't know</i>

17:09.737 --> 17:13.198
your moms are partners now!

17:13.741 --> 17:16.827
Hey, I ran into Juan Carlos
at the co-work.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.078
Don't even tell me.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.956
I even flirted with some guy

17:21.040 --> 17:23.000
to make Juan Carlos jealous.

17:23.083 --> 17:23.959
Did it work?

17:24.043 --> 17:25.085
I'm not sure.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.464
But the guy did flirt back,

17:28.547 --> 17:29.965
and I loved it.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.678
That's great! You should go for it.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.013
What if he turns me down?

17:36.096 --> 17:38.098
Have you looked in the mirror?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.517
You're hot, brilliant,

17:41.018 --> 17:42.478
experienced.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.690
Plus, forties are the new twenties.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.158
Yes, they are, sweetie.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.410
Oh, Mom. I thought Víctor was different.

17:59.036 --> 18:02.498
Honestly, that was something
you could've seen coming.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.916
Why?

18:05.459 --> 18:08.337
When things are going well,
you always mess it up.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.092
Whoa!

18:14.718 --> 18:16.804
You think I always mess things up?

18:16.887 --> 18:19.431
No, that sounded terrible.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.936
I meant you don't always
make the best decisions.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.105
You know what, Mom? Drop it.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.649
And I'll tell you something else.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.276
I'm sick of no one believing in me.

18:32.027 --> 18:32.861
Tere…

18:35.322 --> 18:37.533
That's not what I meant, sweetheart.

18:40.994 --> 18:41.912
I screwed up.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.705
Don't worry, Lucía.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.957
She'll get over it.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.168
I can't make it to Rorro's grand opening.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.878
Was the paint helpful?

18:52.339 --> 18:53.924
Is that why you invited me here?

18:54.800 --> 18:58.095
To rub it in my face
that you gave me the paint?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.722
I invited you to wish you luck.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.474
Why luck?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.602
Because I need it,
or because I'm an idiot?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.772
Fuck, Víctor, I'm being honest here.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.232
You're going to do great.

19:10.941 --> 19:11.817
Juan Carlos,

19:13.193 --> 19:17.156
I'm sick of you and our parents
thinking I'm a screwup.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.868
Your partner also thinks she's a screwup.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.953
Maybe you'll cancel each other out.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.790
That was so funny.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.709
You're especially funny today.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.210
See you later.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.889
What are you looking at?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.600
The owner of the co-work. He's so hot.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.517
Damn!

19:45.601 --> 19:48.061
Besides, he's so nice. He's perfect.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.525
The guy in the black jacket?

19:55.319 --> 19:57.529
No. Ferrán.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.697
He's the owner.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.201
The owner of the co-work?

20:03.994 --> 20:05.078
Okay.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.957
-Hey!
-Hey.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.375
Is something wrong?

20:10.459 --> 20:13.212
No, but I think I messed up bad.

20:17.841 --> 20:18.926
What?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.012
-You're good.
-Okay.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.145
DO YOU FIND HER SMELL IRRESISTIBLE?
NO

20:30.938 --> 20:32.147
<i>Believe me now?</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:34.066
That's why it has to be that song.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.652
You suck at reggaetón.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.696
But '70s style clothes look great on me.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.740
So, okay. I'm in.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.325
We'll win. You'll see.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.972
<i>"Do tiny little details</i>
<i>remind you of her"?</i>

21:05.806 --> 21:07.266
Well, yeah. Regina.

21:07.849 --> 21:08.976
No, wait.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.480
"Do you unwittingly say your ex's name"?

21:14.606 --> 21:15.440
No.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.402
"Do you stalk her on social media"?

21:20.737 --> 21:21.822
Not really.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.448
Fine, you were right.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.208
Since when do you like Otaku snacks, man?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.876
Mind your business.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.006
You've been acting so weird, office boy.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.467
<i>Women are an undeniable force.</i>

21:42.551 --> 21:45.012
That's why we must fight
for gender equality.

21:45.095 --> 21:49.558
Don't forget you can donate
to the women's shelter.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.560
Yeah, there's a link.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.478
My friend is here now.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.856
Mariana.

21:55.939 --> 21:56.815
Mariana.

21:57.774 --> 22:01.111
I think we're having a beer,
so I must leave you.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.158
Sorry for interrupting.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.578
-Thanks.
-And for the way I reacted.

22:10.245 --> 22:14.249
-I assumed you were a douche.
-No, I'm the one who's sorry.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.251
We're installing clear signs.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.129
Well, thanks.
And thanks for fixing my bike.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.715
I depend on it to take my baby to daycare.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.633
Funny coincidence.

22:24.301 --> 22:28.055
I'm working on setting up
daycare here in the office.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.599
Really? That would be amazing.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.769
I haven't been working here very long.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.896
I have a maternity app.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.857
That's interesting. We're in sync.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.194
-Consider me your ally.
-Wow.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.531
Now I see why my partner
chose this co-work.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.034
-She's amazing.
-Wow.

22:49.117 --> 22:52.037
I wish that was said of me.
I can't wait to meet her.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.456
Sorry, but I have to run.

22:54.539 --> 22:55.957
-But your beer.
-I know.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.168
-Can I take a rain check?
-All right.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.054
DO YOU HATE SEEING HER WITH ANOTHER?
YES

23:09.137 --> 23:10.222
His name is Ferrán.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.349
He's a womanizer.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.818
<i>We won't finish today.</i>

23:22.901 --> 23:26.071
Oh no. I hope we do.
Tomorrow is Ro's dance contest.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.614
By the way,

23:29.032 --> 23:29.866
I met someone.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.996
-So?
-Well, he's nice.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.834
He has great ideas,
and we had a beer together.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.794
Still, I'm not sure.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.963
What are you waiting for?

23:43.797 --> 23:47.426
Even I'm considering dating
the hot guy who flirts with me.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.429
It's time to turn the page.

23:51.388 --> 23:55.308
I won't sit around and wait to see
if things improve with Juan Carlos.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.935
That sounds perfect.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.146
Yes, perfect.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.857
We can't sit around and wait.
That's our concept.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.483
It's perfect for the app.

24:03.567 --> 24:07.737
We wait, but we're active
because life goes on, right?

24:07.821 --> 24:10.574
Today's moms don't sit around and wait.

24:10.657 --> 24:11.700
I love it.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.329
Now, promise me one thing.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.791
You won't sit around and wait.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.334
I promise.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.879
Way to go! Let's finish this up.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.006
<i>It's late. When's she getting here?</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:34.097
Where's your costume?

24:34.181 --> 24:35.724
We're dancing flamentón.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.767
It's a mix of flamenco and reggaetón.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.270
What if I don't want to dance flamentón?

24:41.396 --> 24:43.607
All boys would kill to twerk with me.

24:43.690 --> 24:44.900
You're a traitor.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.443
We had a deal.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.115
Ro!

24:52.199 --> 24:54.367
Wait, Mom. I'll go talk to him.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.423
Why do you let her walk all over you?

25:09.007 --> 25:09.925
I don't know.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.761
Actually, I do.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.805
Paloma is like a movie villain.

25:15.889 --> 25:19.601
Everyone likes her.
Being her boyfriend makes me "the boss."

25:21.394 --> 25:23.980
You know you don't need
a popular girlfriend, right?

25:24.064 --> 25:26.399
Says the one who's dating a cool gamer.

25:28.985 --> 25:29.903
I know.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.322
Know why I'm dating him?

25:32.864 --> 25:34.074
Because he's hot.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.202
I like how good he is to me.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.538
You deserve at least that.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.540
Come on.

25:42.999 --> 25:46.753
Besides, this isn't over.
You didn't learn choreography for nothing.

25:47.587 --> 25:48.505
I have a plan.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.132
Isn't this strange?

25:51.216 --> 25:52.592
What are they up to?

25:52.676 --> 25:53.760
I have no idea.

25:55.595 --> 25:56.429
Are you ready?

25:57.847 --> 25:59.808
-Yeah.
-Come on. Sit here.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.143
Mom, you sit there. Dad, you sit here.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.563
-What is this?
-All right.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.439
-Okay.
-Alexa, play the song.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.585
Well done!

26:33.133 --> 26:34.342
That's right!

27:57.342 --> 27:59.469
<i>-Message from Paloma.</i>
-What is it?

27:59.552 --> 28:01.721
<i>Why didn't you "like" my photo, Ro?</i>

28:01.805 --> 28:05.183
<i>Is it 'cause I twerked with your friend?</i>
<i>That's toxic masculinity.</i>

28:05.266 --> 28:07.686
Toxic masculinity?
I'm always doing what she wants.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.733
<i>I danced better than Rosalía</i>,

28:13.817 --> 28:15.694
<i>and he didn't come to support me…</i>

28:15.777 --> 28:17.112
What a liar.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.197
She wants a comment? Fine.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.657
No. He's doing it.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.117
What is he doing?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.869
Mom, he's breaking up with her
on her livestream.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.539
It's much worse than breaking up via text.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.583
It's like breaking up with her
in public, but with emojis.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.210
Are you sure?

28:33.753 --> 28:34.671
WE SHOULD BREAK UP

28:36.548 --> 28:38.591
I'm such a great teacher.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.385
I'm telling Darío about this.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.430
Wait.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.974
Your moves were amazing and--

28:46.057 --> 28:49.102
Your grandma told me why you did all this.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.104
Our problems are ours to solve.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.690
You can't force things in a relationship.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.609
Yeah. Trust me. I get it now.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.624
Hey! Wait up.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.252
I owe you a beer. I mean, two beers.

29:14.335 --> 29:17.422
One for the bike,
and one for leaving the other day.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.591
Okay.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.594
I have a meeting now,
but I'm free after that.

29:22.677 --> 29:28.892
My mom is having a grand opening
for a spa that caters to men. Wanna come?

29:28.975 --> 29:30.435
Sure.

29:30.518 --> 29:33.521
-Shall we meet up here?
-Yeah, I'll see you here.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.439
All right.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.817
-See you later.
-Definitely.

29:42.614 --> 29:46.743
HE SAID YES!

29:46.826 --> 29:50.038
IT WOULD'VE BEEN SO AWKWARD IF HE SAID NO

29:51.372 --> 29:52.207
I'm sorry.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.125
It was my fault Ro got confused.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.669
I'm also to blame.

29:57.295 --> 30:00.006
I let you spend the night.
We confused him.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.466
And Ceci too.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.677
-I don't want it to happen again.
-No.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.349
As soon as the remodel is done,
I'll clear out of the co-work.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.684
I'm curious.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.895
Are you and the hot guy involved?

30:16.147 --> 30:17.023
No.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.277
I only flirted with him
to set boundaries with you.

30:23.112 --> 30:23.947
Though,

30:24.781 --> 30:26.699
it made me realize I want other things.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.370
Other things or other guys?

30:30.453 --> 30:31.704
Stop it, Juan Carlos.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.582
I have to run.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.253
Besides, we're not ready
to talk about these things.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.468
<i>You're such an idiot!</i>

30:46.386 --> 30:48.221
He missed an open goal, man.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.643
I got a positive result.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.144
For the test.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.107
I'm still in love, but with Cynthia. Look.

31:00.149 --> 31:01.359
Well, finally.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.236
About time you realized it.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.455
I think you lost something.

31:15.623 --> 31:18.626
No, I left it in your office
to challenge you to a rematch.

31:19.168 --> 31:22.922
Why don't we get coffee instead,
like you promised?

31:24.048 --> 31:27.260
I don't want to be rude,
but I have plans tonight.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.137
Can we do it next week?

31:29.721 --> 31:30.680
Of course.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.182
-No worries.
-Okay.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.645
<i>Can we talk?</i>

31:39.522 --> 31:41.983
I just need to get something
off my chest, please.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.988
Do you want to be my plus-one?

31:47.071 --> 31:48.031
I can't.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.618
I'm sorry, Cynthia. I get it now.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.998
I was scared of risking my stability
with Mariana and Regina.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.501
It's only fair to give this a shot.
I want to be with you.

32:02.879 --> 32:06.132
Pablo, I can't handle you
changing your mind all the time.

32:06.215 --> 32:07.216
Please.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.676
Look.

32:13.973 --> 32:15.850
I bought these because of you.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.645
You eat them when you're stressed.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.189
You can't fix this with Pockys.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.524
I know, but it's a start.

32:24.984 --> 32:25.818
Give me a chance.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.988
I'll think about it.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.865
Nothing more.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.908
Okay.

32:33.409 --> 32:36.371
I'll text you the address
in case you decide to come.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.469
My meeting ran long. I couldn't escape.

32:51.552 --> 32:54.222
-Really?
-Yeah, it was terrible.

32:54.764 --> 32:55.890
-Yeah.
-But it's over.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.770
-Please.
-Thanks.

33:05.775 --> 33:06.734
You look stunning.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.152
Thank you.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.296
What's with the champagne?

33:27.380 --> 33:29.257
Juan Carlos sent it. Look.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.802
"I'm sure Rorros will be a success."

33:33.428 --> 33:35.930
"You're the best. I love you, bro."
That's great.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.016
Can I have an interview?

33:38.099 --> 33:41.060
Of course,
but she's the one you should interview.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.687
Tere came up with the concept.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.315
We'll do it in a minute. First, a toast.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.237
Thank you for coming.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.740
My partners and I are so excited

33:53.823 --> 33:56.075
about this grand opening.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.078
Remember, tonight, anything goes!

33:59.162 --> 34:01.205
Hell yeah!

34:05.585 --> 34:07.378
That dress looks great on you.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.757
-I'm only here to show it off.
-Oh really?
