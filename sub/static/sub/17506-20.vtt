WEBVTT

00:06.528 --> 00:08.300
Where is this
wonder woman boss Yvonne?

00:08.466 --> 00:10.014
I can't wait to introduce myself.

00:10.139 --> 00:11.094
Trophy husband.

00:11.260 --> 00:12.483
Unfortunately, she does not come

00:12.608 --> 00:13.764
to all of her events.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.349
- Oh.
- But it's her loss, right?

00:15.515 --> 00:17.220
If the first James Bond
and the last James Bond

00:17.345 --> 00:19.645
had a baby, it would be you.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.891
I feel like you're just saying that

00:21.016 --> 00:21.980
'cause I said it in the car.

00:22.146 --> 00:24.194
[Gasps]
Did you say that in the car?

00:24.319 --> 00:26.360
- Dudes. What an event, huh?
- It is.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.699
Yvonne sees a group
of needy kids on the street,

00:28.824 --> 00:30.667
and one week later, bam.

00:30.792 --> 00:32.168
Little pals.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.754
Let's see someone else create
something that incredible

00:33.879 --> 00:35.506
in seven days.

00:35.631 --> 00:37.245
Whoa, see what I did just then?
Create a parallel between...

00:37.411 --> 00:38.375
- We did.
- Mm-hmm.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.456
- Between God and Yvonne.
- Yep.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.667
Wow, talk about mommy issues, right?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.710
[Chuckles] Just...

00:43.876 --> 00:44.920
You know, I signed up
for the little pals

00:45.086 --> 00:46.416
to score points with Yvonne,

00:46.541 --> 00:48.218
but I find it really rewarding.

00:48.343 --> 00:49.758
Javier's life on the street, psh.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.385
It's tougher than anything
I've ever experienced.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.107
And I don't know if I told you,
but I did two tours of duty

00:53.232 --> 00:54.304
over in "Ghanstan."

00:54.470 --> 00:55.764
- Got it.
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.391
You know, Ava, you really
should think about being a pal.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.196
Javier, he's gotten a lot
out of the program.

00:59.321 --> 01:00.852
- But I've gotten even more.
- You know, it's so important

01:01.018 --> 01:02.933
to have a role model as a teen.

01:03.058 --> 01:05.786
My high school music teacher,
Ms. Grace Albanese-Shculman,

01:05.911 --> 01:07.067
changed my life.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.073
She taught me how to sing,

01:09.198 --> 01:10.607
that I was beautiful...

01:10.732 --> 01:12.739
[Voice breaking]
That I was worth something.

01:12.905 --> 01:16.910
I'm sorry.
This mess just got real.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.799
[Sobbing]

01:18.924 --> 01:20.134
There you go.

01:20.259 --> 01:21.540
Sweetie.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.333
- There, there.
- [Sobs desperately]

01:49.705 --> 01:51.236
- Hey, Dawn.
- Hi.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.834
Hey, congratulations on the baby.

01:53.959 --> 01:54.868
Oh, thanks.

01:54.993 --> 01:56.366
Wow, she's so little.

01:56.532 --> 01:57.788
Makes Amy look ridiculous
in this thing.

01:57.913 --> 01:59.995
- [Chuckles]
- Like, who's carrying who, huh?

02:00.161 --> 02:02.543
So glad that you could use
some of Amy's old clothes.

02:02.668 --> 02:03.627
- Oh.
- There you go.

02:03.752 --> 02:05.012
Some of it's barely worn.

02:05.137 --> 02:06.263
- This is great.
- Yeah.

02:06.388 --> 02:08.753
Just let me put her down.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.667
Hey, Leo.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.591
Ah, so you're sure
you won't need 'em?

02:12.757 --> 02:15.139
- No, we're good, thanks.
- Oh, geez.

02:15.264 --> 02:17.763
Oh, oh.
The snowman pajamas.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.431
So many pics in those dogs.

02:19.597 --> 02:20.694
- [Chuckles]
- Ohhh.

02:20.819 --> 02:21.895
Aww. Oh.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.101
Oh, are you kidding?

02:23.267 --> 02:24.698
That's her...

02:24.823 --> 02:27.117
Her little hippie...
Hippie flower Tankini

02:27.242 --> 02:28.535
with her... with her belly
used to stick out.

02:28.660 --> 02:30.237
Her little pot belly
would stick out of...

02:30.362 --> 02:32.289
Holy mother, are those cute.

02:32.414 --> 02:35.405
- Oh, they're all cute.
- Yeah, they sure are.

02:35.571 --> 02:36.910
- Thank you.
- Of course.

02:37.035 --> 02:39.630
You know, it's so...

02:39.755 --> 02:40.697
[Sighs]

02:40.822 --> 02:42.249
Little baby Chloe's got that...

02:42.374 --> 02:43.834
Got that baby smell still, huh?

02:43.959 --> 02:45.624
- Oh, yeah.
- Doesn't she?

02:45.790 --> 02:48.376
- [Babbling]
- Leo.

02:48.542 --> 02:49.389
Leo.

02:49.514 --> 02:51.842
- [Inhales]
- Get down from there.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.227
Ahh.

02:53.352 --> 02:55.479
- Okay.
- [Sighs]

02:55.604 --> 02:57.260
I'm sorry, just gonna grab that
real quick.

02:57.426 --> 02:58.470
What...
What are you doing?

02:58.636 --> 02:59.683
I'm just taking Amy's clothes back.

02:59.808 --> 03:01.014
I made a huge mistake.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.599
- I know I just...
- What?

03:02.765 --> 03:03.766
I thought you said
you didn't need them.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.322
You thought?
You thought?

03:05.447 --> 03:07.324
I'm sorry, Dawn,
but you're not the decider

03:07.449 --> 03:09.606
as to whether or not
I have another child.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.862
Why don't you start worrying
about the kids you have

03:11.987 --> 03:13.580
and not the ones that I might have?

03:13.705 --> 03:14.731
Come on, Amy.

03:14.856 --> 03:18.198
Your brother-slash-sister
might need this.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.618
Jamie, I am really excited
we're doing this.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.578
I am so anxious to help you

03:23.744 --> 03:26.610
and expose you to experiences
that would otherwise be

03:26.735 --> 03:27.874
out of your reach.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.930
Did you enjoy riding
in a private vehicle

03:30.055 --> 03:31.795
where you decided when it left?

03:31.961 --> 03:33.880
My parents have a car,
and so does my brother.

03:34.046 --> 03:36.174
Yes, but probably not
with leather seating.

03:36.340 --> 03:37.676
And GPS.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.741
You see, GPS is a satellite that
follows your vehicle around...

03:40.866 --> 03:42.931
- Oh, Reagan!
- Oh.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.361
This is Jamie, my little pal.

03:44.486 --> 03:45.629
Her parents are going through
a rough divorce,

03:45.754 --> 03:46.977
and her grades are in the crapper.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.854
Oh, well, it's very nice
to meet you, Jamie.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.355
My weird Aunt has that shirt.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.274
Really.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.656
That's perfect,
because I actually bought this

03:55.781 --> 03:58.175
in the wacky relative department.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.532
[Goofy voice]
Hey, hey, hey.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.963
I'm gonna pee.

04:03.088 --> 04:04.369
I'll be right here, sweetie.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.163
I'll always be here.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.330
And here.

04:07.496 --> 04:08.802
Honey, your, uh, your little pal

04:08.927 --> 04:10.208
doesn't seem very needy.

04:10.374 --> 04:11.305
That's because her walls are up.

04:11.430 --> 04:12.586
She's hiding things.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.425
Low self-esteem, history of abuse,

04:15.550 --> 04:17.978
the truth about why
she went into the bathroom.

04:18.103 --> 04:19.175
[Gagging]

04:19.341 --> 04:20.341
Oh.

04:20.509 --> 04:21.444
Reagan,

04:21.569 --> 04:23.138
Yvonne would like
to see you in the studio right away.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.890
What? She's here now?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.019
How do I look?
Do I look okay?

04:26.144 --> 04:27.601
[Huffs]
How's my breath?

04:27.767 --> 04:29.686
I give it a "b".
It be bad.

04:29.852 --> 04:30.437
- Oh.
- Here.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.063
Thank you.

04:32.229 --> 04:33.944
[Musical ringtone]

04:34.069 --> 04:35.579
[Chuckles]
Javier.

04:35.704 --> 04:37.431
He, uh, wants to meet me at the beach

04:37.556 --> 04:38.695
to talk through some stuff.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.572
Okay, but not beach.
[Phone beeps]

04:40.738 --> 04:42.019
Can't get his face in the sun.

04:42.144 --> 04:43.742
I just had his teardrop tattoo
lasered off.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.493
- Oh.
- If dreams are made of gold,

04:45.659 --> 04:48.622
he'd be the richest kid on earth.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.695
Hello? Yvonne?

04:51.820 --> 04:53.714
Hello?

04:53.839 --> 04:55.212
Up here.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.173
Oh. Hi.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.050
Is this because we've been
over budget?

05:00.216 --> 05:01.217
No, right?

05:01.384 --> 05:02.389
God, it's about my hair, isn't it?

05:02.514 --> 05:04.141
I-I-it's not professional
enough, right?

05:04.266 --> 05:05.192
Or is it too professional?

05:05.317 --> 05:06.640
Do I talk too much?

05:06.806 --> 05:09.613
Relax, Reagan.
I think you're very talented.

05:09.738 --> 05:11.398
Oh, wow, thank you so much.

05:11.523 --> 05:14.022
- That jacket is so bad-ass.
- Try it on.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.107
Oh, no, I wasn't saying that
because I wanted to...

05:16.273 --> 05:17.734
Go on, put it on.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.239
[Gasps]
Oh.

05:19.364 --> 05:21.154
[Inhales]
Oh, my gosh.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.159
Wow.

05:22.284 --> 05:24.194
- Right?
- [Sighs]

05:24.319 --> 05:26.493
Oh, it's like wearing
a big power cloud.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.634
- Let's have a drink.
- Okay.

05:30.759 --> 05:33.670
Ahem.
Two fingers.

05:33.795 --> 05:35.460
Okay, two fingers.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.759
I want to take y.E.S. Beyond
just a collection of shows

05:38.884 --> 05:40.215
and unite them on one channel,

05:40.381 --> 05:42.763
under one...

05:42.888 --> 05:45.182
Lifestyle brand.

05:45.307 --> 05:47.017
Oh. Wow.

05:47.142 --> 05:51.045
And I think maybe you
could help me with that.

05:53.114 --> 05:54.991
Oh, my God.
I...

05:55.116 --> 05:55.981
That would be amazing.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.327
[Inhales deeply]

05:57.452 --> 05:59.442
Ahem.
To the future.

05:59.608 --> 06:00.414
To the future.

06:00.539 --> 06:04.584
Of y.E.S. Enterprises.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.536
[Spits quietly]

06:06.661 --> 06:09.756
And the promise of new partnerships.

06:09.881 --> 06:11.999
Ahh.

06:14.331 --> 06:15.712
So I'm ready.

06:15.837 --> 06:17.877
I'm really ready to just dig in.

06:18.043 --> 06:19.850
I'm not gonna judge you, you know.

06:19.975 --> 06:21.631
Nothing's too freaky or traumatic.

06:21.797 --> 06:23.842
I don't like school.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.188
How many teachers
are you sleeping with?

06:25.313 --> 06:27.090
No judgment.

06:27.215 --> 06:28.942
All right.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.557
Tell me about your parents.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.393
The divorce is...
Annoying.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.353
A suicide-inducing hellscape of pain?

06:36.687 --> 06:39.232
Before long, Jamie,
with my influence,

06:39.398 --> 06:43.820
you'll be over that pain
and making life-changing goals.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.448
I wanna get my boobs done
and go to Costa Rica.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.745
Jamie.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.076
Jamie.

06:50.242 --> 06:53.583
[Clears throat]
Jamie.

06:53.708 --> 06:56.920
Listen to me.

06:57.045 --> 06:57.917
Ladygirl.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.961
Life is a wild ride.

07:06.133 --> 07:07.844
Your body's changin'.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.514
Your hormones are ragin'.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.309
You want to keep up
with the fast posse.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.606
But, ladygirl,

07:16.731 --> 07:20.565
your horse done come up lame.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.611
Wait.

07:21.736 --> 07:23.318
Ladygirl.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.331
[Door opens]

07:24.456 --> 07:25.648
Dude, I gotta go.

07:25.773 --> 07:27.489
I gotta talk to my wife
about having a second baby.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.948
<i>You're</i> lame, dude.

07:29.114 --> 07:32.327
How's virginity treating you,
skullslayer71?

07:32.493 --> 07:34.162
[British accent]
'Ello, dahling.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.288
Hey, wow.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.123
Somebody had some fun

07:37.289 --> 07:39.626
with her fancy Brit boss
and stole a coat too.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.097
She gave it to me.

07:41.222 --> 07:42.295
It's fabulous, isn't it?

07:42.461 --> 07:44.297
So anyway, I had so much fun, honey.

07:44.463 --> 07:45.673
She... she took me to this bar.

07:45.839 --> 07:47.717
And the bartender guy was this, like,

07:47.883 --> 07:49.511
"mixologist", and he was, like,

07:49.677 --> 07:52.025
grinding stuff up
with a-a freakin', uh,

07:52.150 --> 07:53.223
pestle.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.850
It's... I mean, it was just
so annoying,

07:56.016 --> 07:57.697
but, like, it didn't even
piss me off at all.

07:57.822 --> 07:59.366
God, my tongue feels
really weird right now.

07:59.491 --> 08:01.272
I'm gonna mixologist you a drink.

08:01.438 --> 08:03.233
Okay. Um...

08:03.399 --> 08:04.237
Great.

08:04.362 --> 08:06.189
Babe, I was...
I was thinking that...

08:06.314 --> 08:07.324
You... you know what?

08:07.449 --> 08:08.575
Let's...

08:08.700 --> 08:09.993
Let's have another baby.

08:10.281 --> 08:10.990
[Laughs heartily]

08:11.156 --> 08:12.450
No, I know.

08:12.616 --> 08:13.535

16:11.868 --> 16:15.046
[Cell phone beeps]

16:15.171 --> 16:18.884
I did not give a handy
to Jaden in the bathroom!

16:19.009 --> 16:20.313
God.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.770
[Imitating Yvonne]
Cornerstone. Jacket.

16:21.895 --> 16:25.724
Put it on.
Put on my jacket.

16:25.849 --> 16:27.893
Oh, sh...

16:28.018 --> 16:29.030
[Sighs]

16:29.196 --> 16:30.562
[Groans]

16:30.687 --> 16:32.366
She's messing with your head, Reagan.

16:32.532 --> 16:35.099
She helps you up the Mountain.

16:35.224 --> 16:36.568
She pushes you off.
She's testing you.

16:36.693 --> 16:37.663
It's how she motivates you.

16:37.829 --> 16:39.749
Oh, that is twisted.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.834
She's given and taken away
this watch four times.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.274
And you want to know
the most twisted thing?

16:43.399 --> 16:45.227
I knew she was messing with you
just to mess with me,

16:45.352 --> 16:46.756
and I still let it get to me.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.049
She wouldn't mess with our heads

16:48.215 --> 16:49.216
if she didn't think we were special.

16:49.382 --> 16:51.466
Thank you.

16:51.591 --> 16:53.518
Could you just give me
a little moment?

16:53.643 --> 16:55.170
I just need to be alone for a second.

16:55.295 --> 16:56.922
Sure thing.

16:57.047 --> 16:58.517
You need those floor stuff?

16:58.683 --> 17:00.728
Yeah.

17:04.856 --> 17:07.772
What?

17:12.862 --> 17:15.201
[Sighs]

17:21.905 --> 17:24.906
Oh.

17:27.460 --> 17:30.462
[Sighs]
Very subtle, Chris.

17:33.116 --> 17:37.556
Oh, my.

17:37.722 --> 17:39.214
Awww.

17:39.339 --> 17:41.143
Little John-John.

17:41.309 --> 17:44.853
Oh, that is a low blow.

17:44.978 --> 17:47.441
[Water sloshing]

17:51.444 --> 17:54.446
What are you doing?

17:54.571 --> 17:56.131
[Raspy voice]
It's time, Reagan.

17:56.256 --> 17:58.383
We're having another baby.

17:58.508 --> 17:59.870
Case closed.

18:00.036 --> 18:01.703
[Sighs]

18:01.828 --> 18:02.915
I'm not doing this, Chris.

18:03.081 --> 18:05.123
Seriously. God, this is so not fair.

18:05.248 --> 18:06.658
Just try to resist me, Reagan.

18:06.783 --> 18:08.743
As a sexual being
and as a sexual lawyer,

18:08.868 --> 18:10.256
it's impossible, okay?

18:10.422 --> 18:11.663
So this is happening.

18:11.788 --> 18:12.883
I still got some suds in there.

18:13.049 --> 18:15.000
We'll just pop in.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.301
I can wash your hair all sexy.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.336
Oh, honey, seriously?
That's no one's fantasy.

18:18.461 --> 18:20.322
And what's with the fedora?

18:20.447 --> 18:21.423
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:21.548 --> 18:23.591
Is looking exactly like Frank Sinatra

18:23.716 --> 18:25.010
not sexy anymore?

18:25.135 --> 18:26.522
It's, like, so rat pack.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.762
Chris, I can't deal
with this right now.

18:27.887 --> 18:29.047
There's so much stuff
going on at work

18:29.172 --> 18:30.484
with Yvonne and things that I...

18:30.650 --> 18:32.233
Yvonne! That's the name
I was trying to think of.

18:32.358 --> 18:34.030
I haven't heard it for five seconds.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.906
Let me guess... you're having
a baby with Yvonne,

18:36.072 --> 18:37.408
and you're naming it work.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.493
'Cause that's what you love.
Little baby work.

18:39.659 --> 18:42.288
Enough!
Ehh.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.082
I can't stand to listen
to this any longer.

18:45.248 --> 18:47.043
I have had a rough couple of hours.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.753
Totally flamed out with Jamie,

18:48.919 --> 18:50.752
and I have been the victim
of teenage bullying.

18:50.877 --> 18:51.797
[Cell phone dings]

18:51.963 --> 18:53.007
Uh!

18:53.173 --> 18:55.384
I am not a slut.
I'm a good girl.

18:55.550 --> 18:56.761
Listen.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.388
I couldn't help but overhear
your argument.

18:59.554 --> 19:01.474
Well, you could've if you
hadn't broken into our house.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.982
Christopher,
it seems like you're feeling

19:04.107 --> 19:06.062
that Reagan is choosing work
over you.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.218
Yeah, that's right.

19:07.343 --> 19:08.336
That's exactly what I'm feeling.

19:08.461 --> 19:09.899
Okay, Chris, that's ridiculous.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.306
She's right.

19:11.431 --> 19:13.778
Your insecurity belies your
Michael Phelpsian upper body.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.821
Ava, that's absurd.

19:15.987 --> 19:18.324
Maybe the shoulders
look kind of similar.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.981
Listen, you guys can worry
about when to have another baby

19:20.106 --> 19:21.866
or if, but, Chris,

19:21.991 --> 19:24.622
never doubt that you and Amy
always come first for her.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.071
Please don't push it

19:26.196 --> 19:27.906
because you're feeling threatened.

19:28.031 --> 19:30.211
Your lives are so good right now.

19:30.377 --> 19:34.579
Just slow down
and enjoy what you have.

19:34.704 --> 19:37.615
Yeah, that's...

19:37.740 --> 19:38.886
You're right.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.888
Thank you, Ava.
That was very helpful.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.265
It was, wasn't it?

19:43.431 --> 19:46.641
- I love you, honey.
- I love you too, babe.

19:46.766 --> 19:47.812
Look what I just did.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.648
I just made that magic happen.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.755
I'm like a big sister
to you guys, huh?

19:57.593 --> 20:00.324
Ladygirl, life is a wild ride.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.034
Your body is changin'.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.324
Can't you see
this is going somewhere?

20:03.449 --> 20:04.743
- Yeah.
- So you need to go home.

20:04.868 --> 20:05.955
- Get out of here.
- Got it.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.123
You can go into the garage
or something.

20:11.234 --> 20:14.755
{pub}We're so lucky.
Look it.

20:14.921 --> 20:17.826
[Exhales]
Our lives are too perfect.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.278
Why would we want
to mess with that now?

20:20.403 --> 20:22.163
Mm.

20:22.288 --> 20:25.116
[Sighs]

20:25.241 --> 20:27.002
- You know what?
- Hmm?

20:27.127 --> 20:29.304
When the time's right, we'll know it.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.521
- Yeah.
- Okay?

20:30.687 --> 20:33.983
And then I'll make my move,

20:34.190 --> 20:35.860
and you will receive my gift.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.395
[Snickers]

20:37.520 --> 20:38.763
Your gift?

20:38.888 --> 20:40.415
You really don't want to have
a second baby

20:40.540 --> 20:41.949
right now, do you?

20:42.115 --> 20:44.827
I'm sorry, ****.

20:45.723 --> 20:48.914
Yeah, **** just **** themselves.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.167
Yeah, you cannot resist me.
Oh babe, no don't.

20:54.014 --> 20:56.056
Are you okay?

20:56.644 --> 20:59.967
- Oh, no!
- Look what I've found.

21:01.006 --> 21:02.386
Oh, no!
