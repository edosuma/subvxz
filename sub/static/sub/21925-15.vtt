00:11.511 --> 00:15.140
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery<i>:</i>

00:15.223 --> 00:18.810
Yesterday we dined on the entrails
of his brethren,

00:18.893 --> 00:21.104
and today you seek his favor?

00:21.187 --> 00:23.690
Transport our visitor to guest quarters
on deck three.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.608
Tyler.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.819
<i>Specialist Burnham</i>
<i>has returned safely.</i>

00:27.902 --> 00:29.904
I end you in T'Kuvma's name.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.615
-Focus on your recovery.

00:32.699 --> 00:38.288
When I look at you now,
I see Voq's eyes. I see him.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.706
There is irony here.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.167
The man you fell in love with
was a Klingon.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.586
Do not regret loving someone, Michael.

00:44.669 --> 00:48.298
I need you to tell me,
how did you defeat the Klingon Empire?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.633
The Klingons are like cancer cells.

00:50.717 --> 00:55.263
To root them out,
you must destroy the tumor at its source.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.307
A Klingon attack is imminent.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.435
They are gathering forces
to launch a strike on this whole system.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.979
We need to take it to them.
At 2100 hours,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.066
the <i>U.S.S. Discovery</i> will jump
for the Klingon homeworld.

01:06.149 --> 01:10.653
<i>Allow me to introduce you to the person</i>
<i>who will chart your course to Qo'noS:</i>

01:10.820 --> 01:12.947
<i>Captain Philippa Georgiou.</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:22.290
<i>We have acquired the target.</i>

01:23.750 --> 01:26.044
[Klingons speaking indistinctly
over comms]

01:53.446 --> 01:56.825
<i>On the eve of battle</i>
<i>on a cold and windless night,</i>

01:57.033 --> 01:59.244
<i>an old general turned to a young soldier.</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:03.039
<i>"Tomorrow," said the master,</i>
<i>"you will know fear."</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:07.252
<i>The young soldier who had not yet</i>
<i>experienced the agony of war</i>

02:07.335 --> 02:09.504
<i>looked at the general with quizzical eyes.</i>

02:10.088 --> 02:13.049
<i>"How will I know fear</i>
<i>if I do not know what it looks like?"</i>

02:13.341 --> 02:14.801
<i>The general replied,</i>

02:14.968 --> 02:18.847
<i>"You will know fear</i>
<i>because it speaks very fast</i>

02:19.305 --> 02:20.974
<i>-and it speaks very loud."</i>
<i></i>

02:21.057 --> 02:22.559
Status. Helm.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.436
Bearing 94, mark 21,
12 light years from Klingon home--

02:25.520 --> 02:29.315
Do not show respect by referring
to that green dot as "homeworld."

02:29.399 --> 02:32.318
Klingons are animals
and they don't have homes.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.780
Call it "Qo'noS" or "the enemy planet."
Ops.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.741
Shields holding at 100 percent.
Our scans show--

02:38.825 --> 02:41.286
I have little interest
in what we're scanning.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.164
I care what's scanning us. Communications.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.292
-<i>Discovery</i> is running dark, Captain.
-My favorite way to run.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.172
<i>If that is how fear acts,</i>
<i>recognizing it is easy.</i>

02:52.797 --> 02:55.383
<i>But as the young soldier</i>
<i>considered the general's advice,</i>

02:55.466 --> 02:57.802
<i>she asked the question facing us now:</i>

02:58.553 --> 03:01.723
<i>"Once I know fear, how do I defeat it?"</i>

03:02.849 --> 03:08.521
Specialist, I would appreciate your help
with a glitch in the optical data network.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.907
She does not embody Federation ideals.
We're supposed to follow her orders?

03:18.990 --> 03:20.491
The Federation put her here.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.454
Burnham, I did not give you permission
to leave your station.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.335
What's wrong

03:31.628 --> 03:33.213
Where I'm from, there's a saying:

03:33.504 --> 03:36.716
"Scared Kelpien makes for tough Kelpien."

03:37.300 --> 03:40.970
Have you gotten tough since we
served together on the <i>Shenzhou, </i>Mr. Saru?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.600
Affirmative, Captain.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.018
Very tough.

03:47.101 --> 03:50.647
So much so
that many find me simply unpalatable.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.149
Mmm, I don't know about that.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.485
Where are you from, Captain?

03:56.527 --> 03:59.530
That saying about Kelpiens is so apt,

03:59.614 --> 04:03.910
having experienced it firsthand.
I wonder where it originated.

04:03.993 --> 04:07.580
Don't be silly, Michael.
You know I grew up in Malaysia.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.457
But where exactly?

04:09.958 --> 04:13.044
I went there with you once,
but I can't remember the name.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.299
Pulau Langkawi.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.343
Right.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.763
-Those beautiful beaches.
-Indeed.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.100
Let's take a walk.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.814
Try to expose me again,
and I'll lock you in the brig.

04:32.897 --> 04:36.067
If Starfleet recruited a Terran
to lead the mission, they are desperate.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.777
The Federation had a problem.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.072
I offered them a solution
in exchange for my freedom.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.575
And what's so bad about desperation?

04:45.285 --> 04:50.373
You were desperate when you begged me
to reveal how my empire beat the Klingons.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.253
You instigate valiantly,
then second-guess.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.673
I've now read about your actions
on the eve of the war.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.217
You know your problem? No follow-through.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.471
You should've killed my counterpart
in her ready room,

05:05.888 --> 05:09.267
attacked the Klingons,
and then been a hero.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.728
Tell me the real plan.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.942
Never do that again.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.489
Your Federation is losing.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.869
The Klingon armada is already headed
toward your homeworld.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.788
My knowledge is giving you
a fighting chance.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.126
Are you with me or against me?

05:40.798 --> 05:42.925
With you... Captain.

07:21.149 --> 07:21.983
You?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.571
How? Our lord pierced your heart.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.323
House T'Kuvma feasted on your flesh.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.201
You have the wrong Philippa Georgiou.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.246
Either way,
I can tell you require seasoning.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.793
My home.

07:41.335 --> 07:46.090
There are seven chimneys on Qo'noS
which lead into a dormant volcano system.

07:46.174 --> 07:51.262
Of these, which is the best
for a landing party to reach on foot?

07:51.345 --> 07:52.847
I will tell you nothing.

07:53.389 --> 07:58.811
This war ends when we crush you,
united under T'Kuvma's call.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.815
This war may rage on, but your war,
your great dream of Klingon unification?

08:02.940 --> 08:03.941
It's already lost.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.902
Go to hell, very small human.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.737
You both talk too much.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.825
-No!
-Computer, reactivate containment field.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.076
Control to my voice.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.291
Tell me where my party should land.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.860
You have already lost.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.906
-Enough!

08:56.452 --> 08:57.495
There's another way.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.970
Admiral Cornwell briefed me
on this half-breed.

09:14.428 --> 09:18.641
I can see from a strategic standpoint
its value as a weapon.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.770
But as its Klingon id has been neutered,

09:23.312 --> 09:28.109
it is benign, useless to them,
yet tarnished to the Federation,

09:28.192 --> 09:31.654
so what good is it to either side?

09:33.322 --> 09:36.492
<i>He</i> has access to the Klingon's memories.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.288
All I can see is a who-knows-what
playing with string.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.542
This is a bowline.
It doesn't run, it doesn't slip.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.880
It's the first thing I learned as a kid
that made me... me.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.134
Ties me to my past, who I am.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.304
Voq's life, his memories,
they're here, too.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.014
Always with me.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.768
I'm willing to share his knowledge.
Not for you.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.271
For...

10:07.690 --> 10:08.608
Starfleet.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.613
Do you want my help or not?

10:15.406 --> 10:17.783
What do you know
about the surface of Qo'noS?

10:19.327 --> 10:22.079
The plan is to use a drone
with rock-penetrating surveillance systems

10:22.163 --> 10:24.373
to map the surface
and identify military targets,

10:24.457 --> 10:27.043
in preparation for a future
full-scale attack.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.462
Unfortunately,
the cave <i>Discovery </i>will hide in

10:29.545 --> 10:34.425
isn't connected to the dormant volcanoes.
In order for the mapping drone to work,

10:34.508 --> 10:38.179
it has to be introduced into one of these.
As you're aware,

10:38.262 --> 10:41.349
information regarding Qo'noS
is virtually non-existent.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.893
We're depending on black-market surveys
acquired by the Vulcans

10:43.976 --> 10:45.269
over a century ago.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.774
This chimney's
in the high council chamber.

10:50.191 --> 10:54.236
All hybrid areas, that place.
This one's now flooded by the river Skral.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.532
Here, this is your best bet,
the safest access point for the drone.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.953
Centuries ago when the caldera was active,
these vents were shrines.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.248
Live sacrifices were thrown in
to honor Molor.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.419
When Kahless defeated Molor,
those temples were abandoned, built over.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.216
The ones that remained were shielded to
make them impossible to find with sensors.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.219
You'll have to transport down
and do the legwork yourself.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.345
What's there now?

11:20.554 --> 11:22.139
The land was given to the Orions,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.975
who built an embassy outpost
over the ruins.

11:25.059 --> 11:29.730
In my world, the Orions are delinquents,
pirates, slave traders.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.483
-It's not much different in ours.
-Excellent.

11:34.151 --> 11:38.072
He will accompany us
and help us sniff out what we're after.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.573
Will that be a problem?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.410
-No.
-No...

11:43.828 --> 11:44.662
Captain.

11:46.288 --> 11:50.334
I looked over the crew manifest.
There's somebody else I want with us.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.002
Enter.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.382
I am so pleased to see you, Tilly.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.260
Thank you. I have heard and read
so much about you. Michael can attest,
I'm always asking about Captain Georgiou.

12:03.055 --> 12:07.226
Seeing your face reminds me
of the great fun the two of us had.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.520
Subjugating the Betazoids,

12:09.603 --> 12:11.647
wiping out Mintaka III.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.482
-Oh, she's not--
-No.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.608
So, she's from--

12:14.692 --> 12:15.985
Mmm.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.864
You're the Terran emperor.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.162
-Don't do that.
You look so much like her.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.788
Younger, maybe.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.709
But all that killing ages a person.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.756
-These are hideous, of course.
What is happening?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.176
She requested you for the landing party. Oh. Just so you're clear,

12:44.263 --> 12:46.432
I'm not the same person
I was in your universe.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.058
Don't be so sure, Killy.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.896
You will have the honor
of carrying the mapping drone.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.234
Go to quarters, dress as lowlifes.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.821
We need items to trade,
so as to seem legitimate.

13:01.405 --> 13:05.451
Gabriel must have found something
interesting lying around in this universe.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.798
You gonna be okay down there?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.385
You don't need to worry about me.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.149
<i>First an alternate universe,</i>

13:37.233 --> 13:39.610
now a Klingon cave
on a hundred-year-old map.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.737
Ready as can be, Mr. Saru.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.783
-Black alert. To Qo'noS, please.
-Aye, Captain.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.493
<i>Black alert.</i>

13:47.868 --> 13:49.245
<i>Black alert.</i>

14:12.351 --> 14:13.310
Shields holding.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.981
Stabilizer beams are compensating
for the planet's gravitational pull.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.524
Am I good or what?

14:19.817 --> 14:21.318
We are moored and steady.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.820
<i>You are clear to transport.</i>

14:23.195 --> 14:24.113
Energize.

15:02.735 --> 15:08.073
Not a lot of humans around here.
-Mmm, except the dregs from our race.

15:08.407 --> 15:12.870
Exactly. The Orions here aren't likely
to trust us or give up any information.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.316
Keep walking, Federation.
No one wants you here.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.525
Tilly.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.237
Insult her again, your nose is gonna
be able to sniff the back of your head.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.031
We're here to make a deal.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.535
Show her the stash.
Tell her what she's looking at.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.704
Nausicaan disruptor pistols.

15:55.788 --> 16:00.042
Latest spec, paralithium cell,
with beam and pulse-firing mode.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.963
Polyalloy casings, making it all
but invisible to security screeners.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.547
Two thousand darseks.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.967
Let's see what else you got.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.346
All this arms dealing has my appetite up.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.642
Anyone else hungry Michael?

16:21.021 --> 16:21.855
Greetings.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.565
-Two, please.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.193
I have no idea. I'm not hungry.
I wanted to talk to you.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.236
I intuited.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.656
-No.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.701
All we can do is watch her
like a hawk...

16:34.201 --> 16:35.995
and make sure she stays on mission.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.041
I, um...
I realize how hard this must be for you.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.211
But I got your back.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.423
Thank you.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.178
-Delicious.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.055
-It's a space whale.

16:55.723 --> 16:59.268
Enough distractions.
We're not here for bread and circuses.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.895
Get out!

17:02.312 --> 17:03.147
All of you!

17:05.274 --> 17:08.152
On second thought,
the circus is where we'll start.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.310
-Shh.

17:47.357 --> 17:51.153
I knew your whole universe
couldn't be boring.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.283
Use this.
We'll be more effective if we split up.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.411
Buy information,
whatever gets us to that shrine.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.468
Hmm. How much for a little me time?

18:15.594 --> 18:16.720
Over there.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.388
Bring your friend.

18:20.891 --> 18:25.395
No, no. That's, uh, very generous.
I think I'll stay out here.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.774
She's not for you. Guard the drone.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.582
Maybe these guys
can lead us to the shrine.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.917
If they'll talk to us.

18:47.626 --> 18:51.130
The game is called <i>t'Sang.</i>
Translates to "obliterate them."

18:51.213 --> 18:53.090
-I think I do.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.092
And I think I'm good at it.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.639
I mean, Voq was good at it.
He was a decent gambler.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.933
He felt the numbers always fell his way,

19:03.016 --> 19:05.769
as if the universe was making up
for his bad luck with everything else.

19:05.853 --> 19:06.854
Like what?

19:09.106 --> 19:12.151
He was born with a rare mutation
that made his skin translucent white.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.320
The others considered him
a freak of nature.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.198
What are you doing here, human?

19:18.282 --> 19:20.075
Spying for the Federation?

19:20.159 --> 19:24.371
No, I'm looking to take a few
hundred darseks from losers like you.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.706
Let's begin your humiliation.

19:25.789 --> 19:30.419
Do you have cash to play,
little boy with a big mouth?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.879
Out of my way.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.631
Place your bets.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.050
-Croupier!
Red. Red.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.844
New player goes first.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.221
Two! Two!

19:41.305 --> 19:43.223
Victory! Destroy him!

19:46.643 --> 19:47.769
Two!

19:48.145 --> 19:49.479
Victory! Owned!

20:13.795 --> 20:14.713
Join me.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.173
Thank you.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.638
-Oh, that's so sweet. No, thank you.

20:22.721 --> 20:27.267
I have a very narrow esophagus.
It's strange but true.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.269
So, that's bad for that. I'm not--

20:29.353 --> 20:31.688
Get her out.
-I would love some.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.488
Just a little bit.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.199
Inhale.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.618
Do I just...

20:51.250 --> 20:53.669
Do you think, um...
Do you think I got enou...

21:11.019 --> 21:14.189
I got nothing.
None of them know about an ancient shrine.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.858
You won everyone over quickly.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.695
A human speaking Klingon
is amusing to them.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.238
Might as well be a dog on water skis.

21:23.865 --> 21:27.411
-No, I just made it up.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.372
-I like to water ski.
-Yeah, you have a boat. I remember.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.962
You raced out of there pretty quick.
You all right?

21:39.006 --> 21:42.926
I never told you about my parents,
what happened to them.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.261
No.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.308
I mean, I... I've heard things.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.936
I never wanted to push.

21:54.229 --> 21:57.858
They were stationed at a human-Vulcan
science outpost at Doctari Alpha.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.155
My mom and dad had planned
a family vacation to Mars.

22:04.197 --> 22:10.871
But... I begged them to stay
for three more days,

22:11.913 --> 22:14.583
so I could witness a nearby star
go supernova.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.132
Then the Klingons attacked.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.930
My dad tried to barricade
the kitchen door...

22:30.015 --> 22:32.059
while my mom hid me in a cabinet.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.146
And I couldn't see,
but I could hear everything.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.026
They killed my dad first.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.320
That was quick.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.575
They took longer with my mom.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.538
And when it was over, they sat down.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.042
At our table.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.129
Ate dinner, our dinner.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.178
And they were talking, and laughing.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.767
And just now, all that laughter...

23:19.981 --> 23:21.441
How could you not hate them?

23:24.861 --> 23:29.241
-And me, for what I've become.
-It would be so much simpler if I could.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.623
I look around here and I just...

23:37.999 --> 23:40.085
I see people living their lives.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.839
Maybe it's not normal to us,
but in their own way, ordinary.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.008
The emperor was wrong. This is a home.

23:50.345 --> 23:53.723
And if we give the Federation targets
to attack, it won't ever be the same.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.101
I can see both sides.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.103
Literally.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.482
The side I've chosen is where you stand,

24:02.566 --> 24:07.154
where it's possible to feel compassion
and sympathy for your enemy.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.158
But I can guarantee no Klingon
ever felt that way toward you.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.326
You did.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.590
You see that?

24:28.383 --> 24:30.886
Burning an extra drink,
setting it on fire.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.555
That's a step specific
to the followers of Molor.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.516
There's a chance
they know about that shrine.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.909
-I learned so many new things.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.995
-We shouldn't charge you.
-But we have to charge you.

24:57.579 --> 25:02.167
Perhaps if you teach me something new,
it will be fair trade.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.091
Where is the shrine of Molor?

25:16.223 --> 25:19.392
Hey, stop. Hey, stop that. Shame on you.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.811
You were asleep. I'm Orion.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.482
What did, uh, we inhale?

25:25.941 --> 25:30.570
My mouth tastes like... sulfur and ash.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.865
Volcanic vapor, straight from the source.

25:34.449 --> 25:38.453
Yeah, but not really, right?
All the volcanoes here are extinct.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.997
Oh, no, they're alive.

25:41.831 --> 25:45.210
How's the drone gonna get down there?
The heat will destroy it.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.588
Give me that.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.262
Oh, shit. That is not a drone.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.722
-Tilly to Burnham.

25:59.724 --> 26:03.478
-Go ahead, Tilly.
-First of all, um... So, I'm very high.

26:03.561 --> 26:08.483
Uh, but you need to listen to me.
There are active volcanoes beneath us now.

26:08.566 --> 26:12.362
And the drone-- Also, that's not a drone.
It's, like, a hydro bomb.

26:12.445 --> 26:16.199
-We keep them on the <i>Discovery--</i>

26:18.034 --> 26:18.952
Tilly?

26:20.287 --> 26:21.288
Cadet, respond.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.666
I know where to find the shrine.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.668
What's wrong?

26:26.751 --> 26:27.627
It's Tilly.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.797
A hydro bomb

26:30.880 --> 26:35.051
Detonated into an active volcanic system,
it's just apocalyptic.

26:35.385 --> 26:39.264
A phreatic eruption. Water flashes
into steam, triggers a massive explosion.

26:39.347 --> 26:43.268
Land masses directly over
the reaction center will be vaporized.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.769
Ash will fill the atmosphere.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.855
Within weeks,
Qo'noS will be uninhabitable.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.900
This was the plan all along.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.324
-Burnham to <i>Discovery.</i>
Go ahead.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.452
Georgiou is about to instigate
a catastrophic natural disaster.

27:01.328 --> 27:05.415
<i>She may already be in the shrine.</i>
<i>Can you get a transporter lock on her?</i>

27:05.498 --> 27:08.668
<i>Affirmative. However,</i>
<i>beaming her out is not an option.</i>

27:09.169 --> 27:12.297
The shrine's shields make it unsafe
for biological transport.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.507
What about the bomb

27:14.591 --> 27:17.093
<i> We are too late.</i>
<i>The signal's fading.</i>

27:18.887 --> 27:20.638
<i>We must contact Starfleet.</i>

27:20.889 --> 27:23.183
Saru, I think she's following
Starfleet's orders.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.730
I need to talk to Admiral Cornwell.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.417
Is this how Starfleet wins the war?

27:50.377 --> 27:51.836
Genocide.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.631
You wanna do this here? Fine.

27:55.423 --> 27:58.968
Terms of atrocity are convenient
after the fact.

27:59.052 --> 28:03.014
The Klingons are on the verge
of wiping out the Federation.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.267
Yes, but ask yourself,

28:06.351 --> 28:08.853
why did you put this mission in the hands
of a Terran,

28:08.937 --> 28:09.854
and why the secrecy?

28:09.938 --> 28:13.066
-Because you know it's not who we are.
-It very soon will be.

28:13.149 --> 28:17.612
-We do not have the luxury of principles.
-That is all we have, Admiral.

28:22.367 --> 28:25.870
A year ago... I stood alone.

28:26.329 --> 28:30.208
I believed our survival was more important
than our principles.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.420
I was wrong.

28:36.548 --> 28:41.886
Do we need a mutiny today
to prove who we are?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.819
We are Starfleet.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.876
What is it you're suggesting?

29:17.589 --> 29:18.923
Change of plans.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.341
Really?

29:21.676 --> 29:24.721
-Deactivate the detonator, Philippa.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.639
Your freedom is still granted.
Here's the proof.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.776
You talked them out of it, didn't you?

29:37.859 --> 29:40.278
A planetary slaughter? Yes.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.322
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

29:42.405 --> 29:46.117
When I did this in my universe,
it didn't wipe out the Klingons.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.495
A decent number should be able
to save themselves.

29:48.578 --> 29:52.916
Plus, they'll have an advantage:
no Terran ships firing on them

29:52.999 --> 29:55.251
-as they try to escape.
-Turn it off.

29:55.335 --> 29:59.130
Has it ever occurred to you
that I was doing this for you?

29:59.214 --> 30:00.715
By ending the war,

30:00.799 --> 30:05.720
I set you free from the guilt
and pain you carry because of it.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.264
-Not buying it.
Worth a try.

30:08.348 --> 30:12.685
-You really are nothing like my Georgiou.
-No, and I never have been.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.354
She's dead, Michael.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.650
-There are no second chances.
-No, I suppose not.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.401
I do like you.

30:22.153 --> 30:26.574
Why not join me? The bomb is in position.
We have the detonator.

30:27.116 --> 30:30.453
Starfleet and Klingon alike
will be at our mercy.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.289
I had much the same thought.
Give it to me.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.838
Take your freedom...
in exchange for the detonator,

30:40.630 --> 30:43.591
or try to escape my ship and its crew,

30:44.175 --> 30:47.470
and be hunted by the Federation
for the rest of your days.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.431
You think your Federation scares me?

30:50.515 --> 30:51.641
Not particularly.

30:54.310 --> 30:57.856
But the only way
you're gonna get past me is to kill me.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.863
So you have to watch me die. Again.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.285
And did I mention being hunted
for the rest of your days?

31:13.329 --> 31:15.164
The detonator is coded to my bioprint.

31:17.166 --> 31:21.796
-Not to mine, no. All clear.

31:25.842 --> 31:26.843
What is this?

31:26.926 --> 31:30.763
This is the place
the Federation crushed the Klingons.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.685
We planted a bomb
in the heart of your homeworld.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.520
Qo'noS will be destroyed.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.523
No.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.693
To offer you an alternative.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.662
Klingons respond to strength.

31:55.496 --> 31:58.291
Use the fate of Qo'noS
to bend them to your will.

31:58.374 --> 32:02.420
Preserve your civilization,
rather than watch it be destroyed.

32:05.924 --> 32:06.758
But...

32:07.842 --> 32:08.968
I am no one.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.183
You once told Voq that you
didn't want the mantle of leadership.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.770
I am the Torchbearer,

32:19.062 --> 32:21.397
the one who lights the way
for the leader.

32:22.649 --> 32:26.986
Voq has always believed in you, L'Rell.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.949
It's time for you to leave the shadows.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.878
-I'll leave you to it, then.
-Be good, Philippa.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.007
Or you'll come for me?

32:49.467 --> 32:50.760
Make sure I don't have to.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.159
Isik for your thoughts.

33:18.538 --> 33:22.834
I always wanted to find out what one was.
I never did.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.340
L'Rell's arranged for a transport
to a Mo'Kai ship.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.426
They're in for a surprise.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.886
It's not the human way
to make a message heard,

33:33.970 --> 33:35.346
but it's the Klingon way.

33:37.765 --> 33:38.766
I'm going with her.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.275
It's true what the emperor said.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.320
I'm no good for either side. I...

33:53.239 --> 33:54.741
But maybe I can be good for both.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.664
-I've never been great at goodbyes.
-Neither am I.

34:03.499 --> 34:04.959
I've had too many of them.

34:05.585 --> 34:09.338
Michael, in spite of everything
that happened to you,

34:09.422 --> 34:13.926
your capacity to love...
literally saved my life.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.643
I'm gonna miss looking at you.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.151
I see you, Ash.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.153
In your eyes. Only you.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.279
Thank you.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.190
Burnham to <i>Discovery. </i>One to transport.

35:57.572 --> 36:04.162
T'Kuvma knew that the most
powerful empire was a united empire.

36:05.872 --> 36:09.041
Twenty-four houses working as one.

36:10.293 --> 36:14.505
He believed the quickest way to bring
us together was war with the Federation.

36:15.006 --> 36:19.635
But in this fight, we have lost our way.

36:21.012 --> 36:26.976
A new leader is needed
to fulfill my lord's vision.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.731
I am that leader.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.783
In my hand, I hold the fate
of the Klingon homeworld.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.787
Of the Klingon Empire itself.

36:52.793 --> 36:53.961
We are proud.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.005
We are honorable.

36:56.088 --> 36:59.133
And we will be one again.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.263
You will throw down your arms

37:04.805 --> 37:07.850
or you will suffer the consequences.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.978
The choice is yours.

37:15.733 --> 37:21.155
The reunification of our race begins now.

37:36.629 --> 37:40.883
<i>Earth, Andor, Tellar, Vulcan.</i>

37:41.842 --> 37:43.719
<i>Every planet of the Federation</i>

37:43.928 --> 37:47.056
<i>has made the odyssey</i>
<i>out of darkness into light.</i>

37:47.807 --> 37:51.435
<i>So, too, have the Klingons.</i>
<i>The war is over.</i>

37:55.523 --> 37:56.732
<i>There were triumphs.</i>

37:57.858 --> 37:59.110
<i>Victories of spirit.</i>

38:00.194 --> 38:01.612
<i>Courage beyond reason.</i>

38:02.571 --> 38:05.992
<i>But make no mistake,</i>
<i>these were bleak times.</i>

38:06.200 --> 38:08.035
<i>Times we cannot repeat.</i>

38:09.662 --> 38:11.414
<i>Times we cannot forget.</i>

38:16.419 --> 38:17.962
Isik for your thoughts.

38:18.504 --> 38:20.923
-Oh, I don't know.

38:21.757 --> 38:24.760
Something my mother used to say to me.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.973
Thank you for coming. I'm glad to see you.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.518
Is everything okay?

38:34.395 --> 38:39.400
When I was growing up,
you told me not to forget my humanity.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.281
I didn't know what that meant.
I didn't know how to do it.

38:45.364 --> 38:47.325
I didn't even know why I would want to.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.369
I get it now.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.958
So, thank you. For not giving up on me.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.336
That's what mothers do.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.302
-Michael.
-Father.

39:07.053 --> 39:10.431
What the Federation chose to do
on Qo'noS was unprincipled,

39:10.514 --> 39:12.183
and I had a part in it.

39:14.727 --> 39:18.064
The Klingons made it clear
they would fight us to extinction.

39:18.147 --> 39:21.776
You were desperate to save us.
I know the feeling all too well.

39:21.859 --> 39:27.031
And yet...
you were able to find another way.

39:28.115 --> 39:33.412
I am not alone in finding your commitment
to Starfleet's ideals commendable.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.542
I asked if I may give it to you.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.836
Your record has been expunged.

39:40.920 --> 39:44.382
Your pardon by the president
of the Federation is official.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.675
Commander Burnham...

39:49.512 --> 39:55.434
the Federation is as grateful to you
as I am... to my daughter.

40:00.439 --> 40:03.526
Your mother will stay in Paris
for a few days.

40:03.609 --> 40:06.237
I will travel with <i>Discovery </i>to Vulcan.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.322
We're picking up your new captain there.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.699
I'm glad we'll be
making that journey together.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.081
<i>We are no longer on the eve of battle.</i>

40:17.164 --> 40:19.875
<i>Even so, I come to ask myself</i>
<i>the same question</i>

40:19.959 --> 40:23.087
<i>that young soldier asked the general</i>
<i>all those years ago:</i>

40:23.170 --> 40:26.715
<i>"How do I defeat fear?"</i>
<i>The general's answer:</i>

40:27.508 --> 40:30.719
"The only way to defeat fear
is to tell it no."

40:30.970 --> 40:35.641
No, we will not take shortcuts
on the path to righteousness.

40:36.058 --> 40:41.689
No, we will not break the rules
that protect us from our basest instincts.

40:42.481 --> 40:49.321
No, we will not allow desperation
to destroy moral authority.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.491
I am guilty of all these things.

40:54.618 --> 40:57.538
Some say that, in life,
there are no second chances.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.543
Experience tells me that this is true.

41:02.918 --> 41:08.299
But we can only look forward.
We have to be torchbearers,

41:09.508 --> 41:14.180
casting the light
so we may see our path to lasting peace.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.348
We will continue exploring,

41:16.432 --> 41:18.851
discovering new worlds, new civilizations.

41:21.437 --> 41:26.108
Yes, that is
the United Federation of Planets.

41:26.192 --> 41:29.028
Today we honor Ensign Sylvia Tilly,

41:29.487 --> 41:33.115
accepted into
Starfleet Command Training Program.

41:33.199 --> 41:36.660
Yes, that is Starfleet.

41:36.744 --> 41:41.540
Lieutenant Commander
Paul Stamets, Medical Officer Hugh Culber.

41:42.374 --> 41:45.711
Yes, that is who we are.

41:46.378 --> 41:50.799
Commander Saru, first Kelpien
to receive the medal of honor.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.968
And who we will always be.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.533
<i>Never been to Vulcan before.</i>

42:15.616 --> 42:17.368
If there's time,
I'll show you around.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.995
It's strange that we're not jumping
to Vulcan.

42:20.079 --> 42:23.582
Well, Starfleet has committed
to finding a non-human interface.

42:23.666 --> 42:27.086
Until that happens,
I'm happy to go the old-fashioned way.

42:29.838 --> 42:32.675
-Captain on the bridge.
-Acting captain.

42:32.758 --> 42:33.842
Please take your stations.

42:33.926 --> 42:36.512
You may consult with
Science Officer Burnham later.

42:37.596 --> 42:41.350
Thank you, Mr. Saru,
for permitting me this small indulgence.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.437
I never tire of seeing home.

42:45.521 --> 42:46.522
Of course.

42:47.398 --> 42:51.193
-Yes, Captain.

42:51.277 --> 42:54.113
Set course for Vulcan
and engage at maximum warp.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.030
Aye, sir.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.089
-Incoming transmission.

43:12.172 --> 43:16.510
I'm having trouble identifying it.
But it's a priority one distress call.

43:16.594 --> 43:20.055
-Identify the source, please.
-I'm getting a Federation ID code.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.600
It's choppy. Trying to clean it up, sir.

43:22.683 --> 43:26.020
-Helm, slow us down.
-Dropping us out of warp now, sir.

43:27.813 --> 43:30.024
This is Captain Saru

43:30.107 --> 43:33.193
of the Federation starship <i>Discovery.</i>
Please identify yourselves.

43:38.198 --> 43:39.783
Hail's from Captain Pike, sir. It's the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise.</i>
