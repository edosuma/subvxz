00:19.592 --> 00:22.262
They're playing at the Hollywood Bowl
tonight, sold out.

00:22.362 --> 00:26.266
We'll be giving away six more tickets
this morning. 75 degrees in Hollywood.

00:26.366 --> 00:30.636
You've been listening to an hour of nonstop
power rock 'n' roll, on HollyPower 92.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.805
-There's more.
-At the top of the hour...

00:32.872 --> 00:35.308
here in the Valley, it's a balmy 83 degrees.

00:35.408 --> 00:37.010
Gotta go, but first...

00:37.310 --> 00:39.746
here's the story of my life.

03:02.455 --> 03:04.890
I don't want to, like, start a family.

03:04.990 --> 03:08.260
I'd get all puffed out to the max
and all, for sure!

03:08.928 --> 03:11.864
Oh, God, gag me. How could you?

03:11.897 --> 03:14.032
Sure, I'd be freaking--

03:14.100 --> 03:16.935
I'd be scarfing up everything in sight.

03:17.269 --> 03:19.271
I'm sure. I don't know.

03:19.338 --> 03:23.108
I'd get so fat and all,
and what would happen to my zits?

03:23.175 --> 03:25.143
They can get so grody.

03:25.211 --> 03:28.714
And besides, it's totally gnarly birth control.

03:29.415 --> 03:31.150
He's not so awesome.

03:31.283 --> 03:33.251
Awesome's not the word for Brad.

03:33.351 --> 03:35.654
-Oh, I'm sure.
-He's okay, I guess.

03:36.121 --> 03:37.456
Who am I kidding?

03:37.823 --> 03:40.426
He makes my mouth water.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.662
Brad'll be at my party tonight.

03:43.695 --> 03:46.965
Great, that'll attract every girl
west of Van Nuys Boulevard.

03:47.032 --> 03:48.834
Your place will be packed.

03:50.102 --> 03:51.871
Okay, so he's awesome!

03:52.538 --> 03:56.675
God, Julie, don't be so greedy.
You know, save some for the rest of us.

03:57.042 --> 04:00.646
Tommy is such a hunk, I can't stand it.

04:01.179 --> 04:02.948
I mean, he is so bitchin'.

04:03.082 --> 04:05.951
I can't even believe
you'd give Brad the time of day.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.387
But Tommy can be such a dork, you know?

04:08.420 --> 04:11.991
Like, he's got the bod,
but his brains are bad news.

04:12.558 --> 04:15.827
But he is bitchin'.
You really are so lucky, Julie.

04:16.362 --> 04:19.464
I know, but we've been going together
so long now.

04:19.565 --> 04:23.635
I'm beginning to think I'm a piece
of furniture or something, like an old chair.

04:23.702 --> 04:25.504
Total bad news.

04:26.305 --> 04:28.306
I definitely need something new.

04:29.174 --> 04:31.310
...bags off at home and hit the beach, okay?

04:31.343 --> 04:32.510
Let's do that.

04:32.544 --> 04:34.146
-Sounds good.
-Julie, like--

04:34.246 --> 04:35.647
I hate these escalators.

04:35.714 --> 04:38.417
Guys, we won't have time
to get ready for my party.

04:38.483 --> 04:39.951
Yes, we will.

04:43.889 --> 04:45.724
What a surprise finding you here.

04:45.790 --> 04:48.426
Should I be at home,
waiting for the phone to ring?

04:48.494 --> 04:51.230
I could grow old and prune up,
waiting for that.

04:51.330 --> 04:52.798
Funny. What's your problem?

04:52.898 --> 04:56.134
What's my problem?
Try two days and no phone calls.

04:57.936 --> 04:59.738
I'll see you guys at the bus.

04:59.771 --> 05:02.074
-Okay.
-That's all right.

05:04.643 --> 05:07.412
I'm totally not in love with you
anymore, Tommy.

05:07.479 --> 05:09.448
I mean, it's so boring.

05:11.583 --> 05:12.550
Here.

05:15.854 --> 05:19.258
Not too cool, Julie. I won't be bummed out.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.462
Who else is there?
No other Val dude can touch me.

05:24.496 --> 05:26.498
She must be really freaking out.

05:26.898 --> 05:29.101
-I want a corn dog.
-I want a pizza.

05:29.134 --> 05:32.037
-Diet Pepsi with French fries.
-Those are totally fattening!

05:32.137 --> 05:33.138
I got it.

05:33.838 --> 05:36.241
-I'm sure!
-Diet Pepsi's diet.

05:38.177 --> 05:41.413
It'll be a great party night.
Everyone will be there.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.782
Pass on cotillion just this once, okay?

05:43.815 --> 05:46.718
My mom would kill me
if she found out I'd skipped out on it.

05:46.818 --> 05:50.822
Look, this is the social event of the season.
Don't be dull.

05:52.524 --> 05:55.861
-Where does she live?
-23727 Sierra Vista.

05:59.497 --> 06:00.665
I'm sure. Move.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.869
The best guys will be there.
It'll be totally hot.

06:04.169 --> 06:07.272
-That guy is so cute!
-He is.

06:07.339 --> 06:09.007
-Look at him!
-He smiled.

06:09.374 --> 06:11.042
-You guys....
-His hair--

06:11.142 --> 06:13.845
-Look how hairy that guy's back is.
-Gross!

06:14.245 --> 06:16.615
The guy has fur all over his face, too.

06:17.416 --> 06:18.784
My God!

06:19.217 --> 06:20.385
What a hunk!

06:20.752 --> 06:23.855
Oh, God, check out those pecs!

06:24.422 --> 06:27.058
I'd go for that in a minute. For sure.

06:27.158 --> 06:28.526
He's hot!

06:28.627 --> 06:31.663
-He's my kind of guy.
-Aren't they all?

06:31.997 --> 06:35.200
Most of them are.
They didn't have corn dogs, so I got--

06:35.267 --> 06:36.901
I hate....

06:37.636 --> 06:41.106
Hey, man, 23727 Sierra Vista.

06:41.173 --> 06:44.309
It's a party. It is going to be amazing.
I've seen the chicks.

06:44.743 --> 06:47.312
I know about these things.
I got a feeling about this.

06:47.379 --> 06:49.681
It's going to be hot. I'm telling you.

06:50.415 --> 06:51.749
And it's in the Valley.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.120
What?

06:57.021 --> 07:00.024
-The party's in the Valley.
-I don't want to go to the Valley.

07:00.892 --> 07:03.561
-Trust me, I know--
-I don't want to go to the Valley.

07:03.661 --> 07:05.496
I'm not in the mood to go there.

07:06.664 --> 07:10.068
Come on, Julie. You know Loryn
won't let her mom wait for us.

07:10.435 --> 07:13.238
She'll want to pounce
on the first available bod.

07:13.472 --> 07:16.608
God. Hey, do you think
she does everything she says?

07:16.741 --> 07:20.579
I don't know. She'll get in a lot of trouble,
though, if she doesn't watch out.

07:20.645 --> 07:22.247
I think she does.

07:22.313 --> 07:25.516
Who could make up,
"That stuff tastes like Clorox"?

07:25.584 --> 07:27.786
God, gross me out!

07:27.886 --> 07:29.921
I don't know.
I think she's lonely, you know?

07:29.988 --> 07:32.023
When does she have the time?

07:32.090 --> 07:35.427
-She's got problems.
-Yeah. Hormones, I guess.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.731
-No, that's when you grow a mustache.
-Puke! Gross!

07:39.764 --> 07:42.433
I don't know,
it's up to us to look out for her.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.370
She is our friend.
She'd do the same thing for us.

07:45.570 --> 07:46.972
I guess.

07:48.072 --> 07:49.174
Okay.

07:51.676 --> 07:54.145
-Hold still.
-God, what am I going to do?

07:54.245 --> 07:56.948
Tommy's going to be there.
You know how he is.

07:57.081 --> 07:59.717
He's not going to appreciate
me talking to Brad.

07:59.784 --> 08:02.387
Get real. You're not
going through with this, are you?

08:02.487 --> 08:05.657
I'm so sure! Brad's totally hot.

08:05.923 --> 08:07.692
I think he's totally not.

08:09.027 --> 08:11.329
-God, I'm so nervous.
-Okay, let's go!

08:14.566 --> 08:18.336
-We're taking off now, guys.
-Don't you two look great!

08:18.403 --> 08:21.239
Stacey, if I were 20 years younger, honey....

08:21.406 --> 08:24.609
God, Dad! I won't be too late, I'm sure.

08:24.675 --> 08:26.611
We don't want to pressure you, dear.

08:26.678 --> 08:29.380
Just let us hear from you by next Tuesday,
okay, honey?

08:29.447 --> 08:32.917
I'm not going away on a peace march
or something heavy like that, Pop.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.453
-I can dig the scene. No sweat.
-I have to be home by 1:00.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.823
We try to give Julie all the space she needs.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.058
I know, Mom.

08:40.124 --> 08:42.994
-'Bye. Have a good time.
-'Bye.

08:44.095 --> 08:46.864
-Bye-bye.
-Have a good time.

08:51.770 --> 08:55.307
Sarah, do you know
how much she looks like you?

08:56.607 --> 08:59.177
I mean, you were just her age
when I met you.

09:00.178 --> 09:02.013
Do I still look that way?

09:03.014 --> 09:04.082
Better.

09:05.650 --> 09:08.519
But things were sure a lot wilder then.

09:11.656 --> 09:13.725
Different priorities, that's all.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.227
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.

09:18.029 --> 09:21.065
I tell you what.
You spend the night at my house, okay?

09:21.332 --> 09:23.067
We'll take his mother's car....

09:23.768 --> 09:25.403
Sounds good.

09:26.738 --> 09:29.474
-Forget about her, Tommy.
-Don't worry about it.

09:37.248 --> 09:38.349
Brad?

09:41.853 --> 09:44.088
-Great party.
-It's all right.

09:44.489 --> 09:46.057
Do you like the music?

09:46.658 --> 09:47.858
It's okay.

09:48.593 --> 09:52.063
-Have you tried the sushi yet?
-No. I haven't made it in there.

09:57.969 --> 10:01.539
It won't to be easy. Anytime
you want to come back, you let me know.

10:01.639 --> 10:02.974
I'll think about it.

10:03.041 --> 10:06.110
-I told you to forget it.
-You'll be back.

10:06.210 --> 10:07.378
Yeah, right.

10:14.418 --> 10:16.154
She can't live without me.

10:24.161 --> 10:26.063
He's totally awesome!

10:26.163 --> 10:29.733
-Who, dear?
-Skip! Mom, you're not listening to me.

10:30.901 --> 10:33.805
Skip's a really nice guy,
and I want him to like me...

10:33.871 --> 10:36.207
so I just want to make sure....

10:36.607 --> 10:39.143
Is there something I shouldn't know
that I should know?

10:39.243 --> 10:40.545
Of course there is.

10:47.885 --> 10:49.887
You're right. He is cute.

10:51.189 --> 10:53.491
-I was hoping you'd come.
-Oh, yeah?

10:53.524 --> 10:54.558
Yeah.

10:56.761 --> 10:58.029
What about that one?

10:58.129 --> 11:00.365
-He dresses like a dork.
-Yeah, but he's cute!

11:00.431 --> 11:02.166
How can you like a dork?

11:02.566 --> 11:05.169
Don't look now. Guess who?

11:07.071 --> 11:08.573
Hello.

11:09.073 --> 11:10.241
Good-bye.

11:11.275 --> 11:13.244
God, he's such a total pukeoid.

11:14.312 --> 11:16.647
He's just really bitchin'. You'll see.

11:16.681 --> 11:20.151
Why don't you take this out now?
The guests are waiting for some food.

11:26.324 --> 11:27.892
What was that all about?

11:28.759 --> 11:33.731
I'm only her stepmother, and since Jim died,
she's been kind of competitive with me.

12:00.758 --> 12:02.092
Spring-up?

12:04.395 --> 12:07.331
Freak me out, it's him!

12:07.364 --> 12:09.133
-Who?
-The guy with the brown hair.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.368
Hi, Skip.

12:13.637 --> 12:15.506
Don't be so obvious with boys.

12:18.042 --> 12:19.410
-Hi, Skip.
-Hi, Suzi.

12:19.443 --> 12:21.412
I'd like you to meet my mother.

12:21.979 --> 12:24.682
-Hi, Mrs. Brent. Nice to meet you.
-Call me Beth.

12:30.688 --> 12:32.289
It's nice to meet you.

12:32.523 --> 12:35.025
-Skip! Lyle.
-How do you do?

12:37.828 --> 12:39.830
Honey, the phone's ringing.

12:40.964 --> 12:42.899
Come on, Skip. Let's go dance.

12:46.503 --> 12:49.539
-Look at who Tommy's with.
-Who cares?

12:49.873 --> 12:51.208
Come on.

12:51.642 --> 12:53.811
He's totally juvenile, Stacey.

13:13.797 --> 13:15.632
-Hi, Tommy.
-ls it?

13:16.467 --> 13:18.335
-Yes, it is.
-What?

13:18.869 --> 13:21.138
The most beautiful girl in the world.

13:21.739 --> 13:25.109
-What's the matter with you, dude?
-I think I'm falling in love.

13:29.513 --> 13:31.715
Come on. What about Julie?

13:32.183 --> 13:34.251
That's a real tragedy. Dumped.

13:34.618 --> 13:37.321
Jilted. Right in the toilet. My heart's broken.

13:38.388 --> 13:40.324
I'm sure you got to be drunk.

13:41.491 --> 13:43.760
That's what I've always enjoyed about you.

13:43.827 --> 13:46.463
You're perceptive.
You know how to read a guy.

13:49.199 --> 13:51.602
-I need help.
-Yeah?

13:52.469 --> 13:55.639
I was wondering
if you'd step into my office?

13:58.509 --> 13:59.643
God!

14:01.845 --> 14:03.580
-No.
-Don't worry about it.

14:04.548 --> 14:05.950
Oh, Jesus.

14:06.550 --> 14:08.618
Wait, I got a great idea.

14:25.235 --> 14:26.637
Let's do it.

14:30.407 --> 14:32.676
Okay, smart guy. We're here. Now what?

14:32.742 --> 14:34.645
Mingle. Blend in.

14:36.246 --> 14:37.247
Right.

14:53.163 --> 14:56.333
-Can I pick 'em, or what? Check it out.
-Why don't you lower it?

14:56.400 --> 14:58.969
You don't need to raise up a flag or nothing.

14:59.369 --> 15:00.804
Just looking for action.

15:06.042 --> 15:07.777
Let's check out the eats.

15:11.048 --> 15:13.117
What've we got going here, a bait shop?

15:14.050 --> 15:17.554
It's sushi, don't you know? This is tuna.

15:18.021 --> 15:20.357
This is flying fish eggs,
and that's sea urchin.

15:20.457 --> 15:22.559
This is pistachio paste, isn't it?

15:29.566 --> 15:31.535
Come on, Fred, dig in.

15:33.103 --> 15:35.405
I think I'll just get something to drink.

15:36.806 --> 15:38.175
Wait.

15:38.842 --> 15:40.677
This is not right.

15:41.378 --> 15:45.249
-How can this not be right?
-'Cause what about Julie?

15:46.984 --> 15:48.418
That's over.

15:49.185 --> 15:50.521
She tossed me out.

15:53.523 --> 15:57.894
Don't penalize me for what she did.
I'm the one that got hurt. I am.

16:05.469 --> 16:08.305
-I've always thought about you.
-You have?

16:12.843 --> 16:14.944
I thought about you all day.

16:15.845 --> 16:18.515
-You want to dance?
-ln another life.

16:19.148 --> 16:21.484
I didn't either. I was just taking a poll.

16:21.584 --> 16:23.853
Fred, I didn't know you were this good.

16:23.953 --> 16:26.756
-At least I'm trying.
-What is this, points for effort?

16:26.790 --> 16:29.426
I told you this place
was going to be a waste.

16:31.628 --> 16:33.530
This place sucks.

16:33.897 --> 16:35.965
-Well, well.
-What?

16:41.704 --> 16:44.040
-Hot. Very hot.
-Where? Which one?

16:48.078 --> 16:49.612
They're staring right at us.

16:50.413 --> 16:52.282
Gross! Let's move.

16:54.718 --> 16:56.753
Wait, let's see what happens.

16:56.820 --> 17:00.190
I'm sure! Tell me all about it.
I'm going to talk to Ralphie.

17:00.356 --> 17:03.693
-Bad luck, Fred. Yours is leaving.
-What do you mean, mine's leaving?

17:03.793 --> 17:06.061
-She winked at you, didn't she?
-She did?

17:06.163 --> 17:08.031
Yeah, don't let her get away.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.575
-Hello.
-Hello.

17:21.077 --> 17:22.545
Having a good time?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.314
I'm trying.

17:25.181 --> 17:26.315
That's good.

17:27.951 --> 17:30.553
-What are you doing here?
-It's a party.

17:30.787 --> 17:33.490
I know it's a party, but who invited you?

17:34.624 --> 17:38.395
You mean you have to be invited?
That explains it.

17:38.795 --> 17:40.797
-What?
-Why everyone is dressed so weird.

17:40.863 --> 17:43.833
If I'd been invited,
I'd have known this was a costume party.

17:43.867 --> 17:45.035
Right.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.108
-I saw you once before, you know.
-Where?

17:53.710 --> 17:54.911
At the beach.

17:56.446 --> 17:57.714
That was you?

17:59.916 --> 18:02.385
Do you think a girl should pet
on the first date?

18:02.452 --> 18:04.487
Who are you, Bozo the Clown?

18:05.855 --> 18:07.190
What's your sign?

18:09.526 --> 18:12.162
Is this gonna mean we're going together?

18:12.228 --> 18:13.329
What?

18:15.098 --> 18:17.133
Is this gonna mean we're going together?

18:19.469 --> 18:20.536
No.

18:22.639 --> 18:23.773
What?

18:25.875 --> 18:28.845
I think it means
you're a pretty lousy friend...

18:28.911 --> 18:32.682
messing around with your friend's boyfriend
while he's in a bad way.

18:35.351 --> 18:36.953
But I'll tell you what.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.022
-What?
-I won't tell anybody if you don't.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.202
Get out....

19:02.645 --> 19:04.480
-I never said that.
-Did you?

19:04.581 --> 19:06.916
-That wasn't you. I'm sorry.
-You know, football.

19:06.983 --> 19:09.719
-I'm not playing this year.
-That was Rick.

19:10.987 --> 19:12.288
Who's Rick?

19:14.190 --> 19:15.758
How you doing, Tommy?

19:16.926 --> 19:18.294
-ls she good?
-Oh, man.

19:18.361 --> 19:20.496
She's a four-star lay, good buddy.

19:25.702 --> 19:27.770
How's your mother?

19:28.338 --> 19:29.538
She's dead.

19:41.184 --> 19:43.185
...and the wind blows it up.

19:43.253 --> 19:44.621
No, I want....

19:48.491 --> 19:50.226
Why don't you get out of here?

19:50.693 --> 19:52.595
You make me get out of here.

19:54.129 --> 19:55.665
Crazy is the word--

19:58.768 --> 20:00.036
Get up!

20:01.671 --> 20:04.673
-You have nothing, faggot!
-Tommy! Stop it!

20:12.815 --> 20:15.017
-Fuck you!
-Get the hell out of here!

20:23.493 --> 20:25.628
-I don't want to hurt you guys.
-You get out--

20:25.661 --> 20:27.263
Fuck you!

20:30.333 --> 20:31.333
Jerk!

20:31.834 --> 20:33.102
Kiss my ass!

20:34.670 --> 20:36.305
You're good, man.

20:36.439 --> 20:39.141
What were you doing in there,
kissing girls goodnight?

20:39.241 --> 20:40.543
-Listen--
-Don't!

20:40.577 --> 20:41.977
-I won't.
-Good.

20:54.156 --> 20:56.859
That chick, Julie, she's truly dazzling.

21:00.796 --> 21:01.964
Yep.

21:02.832 --> 21:04.400
But she's not one of ours.

21:22.552 --> 21:24.120
Hey, what the hell?

21:24.653 --> 21:27.656
Dickhead, what are you trying to do,
get us killed?

21:27.890 --> 21:31.727
What the hell's the matter with you?
Shit, this is my mother's car.

21:31.794 --> 21:34.129
Who the fuck was that guy?

21:34.196 --> 21:38.267
And I was doing all right with that chick.
Who the fuck does he think he is?

21:39.201 --> 21:40.669
Maybe he was her boyfriend.

21:40.736 --> 21:44.440
Nobody is going to tell me
who I can score with!

21:45.007 --> 21:48.411
I want this chick, she wants me,
so fuck it. We're going back.

21:52.615 --> 21:55.718
My mom will shit
if she knows you're driving this car.

21:56.419 --> 21:59.421
I really don't give a shit
what your mother thinks.

22:35.491 --> 22:39.428
It's bad enough you got to be here.
Be far worse if I got the same treatment.

22:39.495 --> 22:43.065
Wait a second. What are we doing here?
I don't have a death wish.

22:53.409 --> 22:56.178
-They're cute, aren't they?
-Yeah, so swell.

23:42.190 --> 23:45.461
-What if somebody comes?
-Don't worry about it.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.402
Somebody could come.

23:54.436 --> 23:55.804
I told you.

23:56.004 --> 23:57.106
Hurry up in there!

23:57.206 --> 23:59.875
-They can wait.
-Come on, man, I gotta go.

24:01.276 --> 24:02.878
-Take a hike.
-Doug.

24:02.945 --> 24:03.946
-Come here.
-No!

24:04.046 --> 24:05.314
Okay. Lose out.

24:05.747 --> 24:08.617
-I'm sure.
-Come on, hurry up.

24:09.118 --> 24:11.586
I'm hurrying. Meet me later?

24:13.288 --> 24:14.222
Will you?

24:16.725 --> 24:19.027
-Creep.
-Thanks a lot, man.

24:27.569 --> 24:29.972
-I can't believe he did it.
-I can.

24:30.205 --> 24:32.941
I can't. But guess who's looking at you?

24:41.116 --> 24:44.486
So I said, "Oh, my God,
I just can't touch that thing."

24:44.553 --> 24:46.288
Oh, God, it looked so....

24:48.023 --> 24:50.192
So what? Tell me.

24:51.226 --> 24:52.227
Awesome.

24:52.661 --> 24:55.063
It's like shaking hands with your best friend.

24:55.564 --> 24:57.032
Only, like, real fast.

24:57.966 --> 24:59.468
Come on, let's go.

25:15.050 --> 25:16.652
How many is it we've had?

25:16.718 --> 25:19.154
-You getting high?
-Golly! Where did you get that?

25:19.254 --> 25:22.224
-I'm making some lines here for you.
-Oh, wow!

25:23.358 --> 25:25.393
How is it? Okay?

25:28.097 --> 25:30.765
Hey, you're gonna lose your nose. Look out.

26:13.675 --> 26:16.211
-Don't be afraid.
-What are you doing here?

26:16.277 --> 26:18.346
Do you have a death wish or something?

26:18.813 --> 26:20.849
-That's what Fred said.
-Fred said?

26:20.916 --> 26:22.050
Never mind.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.488
You live around here?

26:28.056 --> 26:30.158
This is very strange.

26:30.759 --> 26:34.362
-What are you doing back here?
-I forgot my comb.

26:35.430 --> 26:36.932
Really, now?

26:36.998 --> 26:41.103
To tell you the truth,
I thought that maybe you and I could....

26:42.937 --> 26:44.406
We could what?

26:46.241 --> 26:47.975
We could get out of here.

26:49.411 --> 26:53.081
I don't think you'd be any more welcome
down there, right now.

26:53.882 --> 26:55.383
Let's leave the party.

26:55.450 --> 26:58.787
-I'm so sure.
-Cool.

26:59.987 --> 27:01.690
I'll meet you out front.

27:02.090 --> 27:04.292
Wait a minute. Where are we gonna go?

27:06.595 --> 27:07.829
I don't care.

27:10.165 --> 27:12.367
-What are we gonna do?
-Anything.

27:15.670 --> 27:19.707
-Okay, but I have to bring my best friend.
-That's fine.

27:21.009 --> 27:22.711
I'll be waiting for you.

27:38.159 --> 27:41.496
God, I don't want to go! I told you.

27:41.596 --> 27:44.399
-It's going to be fun.
-lt is not going to be fun.

27:45.099 --> 27:46.701
They're not even here.

27:46.935 --> 27:48.236
Let's go back.

27:48.503 --> 27:50.539
-I know they're around here.
-Where?

27:50.939 --> 27:52.740
-Right there.
-Hey, come here.

27:52.841 --> 27:56.678
Oh, no. Not those guys.
They're hoods. Juvenile delinquents.

27:56.711 --> 27:58.579
-No.
-You've lost your mind.

27:58.679 --> 28:00.281
-No.
-Look at them.

28:02.350 --> 28:04.386
The rating scale is okay.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.788
-Do this for me.
-I am freaking out!

28:07.322 --> 28:09.390
-No.
-Come on.

28:10.391 --> 28:15.030
Hi. I'm Fred. I like tacos and '71 cabernet,
and my favorite color is magenta.

28:17.432 --> 28:20.902
-I'm Julie, and this is Stacey.
-Charmed, I'm sure.

28:21.035 --> 28:23.271
I'm simply going to freak out and die!

28:23.471 --> 28:25.440
-Would you get in the car?
-God!

28:26.241 --> 28:29.810
I will pay whatever it takes to make sure
nobody breathes a word of this.

28:29.878 --> 28:31.479
I'll be totally bummed out...

28:31.546 --> 28:34.549
if anyone on Earth, outside this car,
finds out about this.

28:34.649 --> 28:37.919
God, where is your sense of adventure?
Will you shut up?

28:37.952 --> 28:41.923
I personally guarantee you,
you will have the time of your life tonight.

28:41.990 --> 28:45.526
-You'll see things you've only read about.
-I'm sure.

28:50.765 --> 28:52.233
I'm freezing.

28:53.334 --> 28:56.037
-Please put the top up?
-Hope you don't mind if I change--

28:56.137 --> 28:59.174
-This is the last time I take you anywhere.
-I'm sure.

29:01.476 --> 29:04.045
-I like this song.
-Oh, God, I hate this song.

29:04.378 --> 29:06.047
I hate this music.

29:27.435 --> 29:28.436
Look!

29:34.209 --> 29:35.677
No way, Bob!

30:14.215 --> 30:16.684
Sweet cheeks and velvet thighs.

30:17.584 --> 30:19.053
Hey, Harvey!

30:20.655 --> 30:24.058
-I thought you were getting the mohawk!
-Nah, I wussed out.

30:26.227 --> 30:27.595
I like this song.

30:34.568 --> 30:38.872
Hey, Rico! What? You didn't! No way, man.

30:39.373 --> 30:42.309
You didn't do that. I'll talk to you later.

31:10.137 --> 31:12.506
Rad! What's doing?

31:12.707 --> 31:16.144
-Check out the cool wheels on that.
-Shit.

31:18.045 --> 31:21.716
-Sid Vicious lives.
-I'm not getting out of this car.

31:21.949 --> 31:25.085
All right. But when they attack the car,
save the radio.

31:32.159 --> 31:35.596
Hey, baby, why don't you get rid of the bum,
and meet me later?

31:42.035 --> 31:44.038
I don't want to go in here.

31:47.107 --> 31:49.043
-What's doing?
-Nothing going.

32:33.721 --> 32:36.090
Hey, Sean, so what's your salami like?

32:40.361 --> 32:43.397
-ls this your hangout?
-This is my home away from home.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.799
-Do you want to sit down?
-Yeah.

32:48.836 --> 32:52.806
You guys want something to drink?
I got some friends I want to see. Let's go.

32:55.842 --> 32:58.446
I don't even wanna know
what's on this seat.

33:15.662 --> 33:19.333
-Where do you live?
-Hollywood. I go to Hollywood High.

33:19.900 --> 33:20.968
Me, too.

33:21.068 --> 33:23.537
Oh, my God. Don't you have a straw?

33:23.570 --> 33:25.939
Totally out of touch with civilization.

33:30.644 --> 33:33.647
This is what we call living on the edge.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.783
You don't have places like this
in the Valley, do you?

33:36.850 --> 33:39.954
-No, we're just not into....
-Slumming it.

33:40.354 --> 33:42.490
So what do you do over there that's hot?

33:43.057 --> 33:47.093
We go to normal parties,
we go to normal places.

33:48.729 --> 33:51.065
Buy nice, new clothes.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.335
That's no different from what we do.

33:55.435 --> 33:58.071
It's the way we do things
that makes the difference.

33:59.306 --> 34:01.741
I guess so.

34:12.152 --> 34:15.089
You know, these guys
all look sick, or something.

34:15.222 --> 34:19.025
-You'd all look healthier with a tan.
-You won't catch anything here.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.661
This is the real world.

34:21.761 --> 34:24.864
It's not fresh and clean,
like a television show.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.868
I always thought
the Valley was real enough for me.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.704
Do you think they could
crank this noise up louder?

34:30.737 --> 34:31.938
Noise?

34:33.873 --> 34:36.043
This music's got emotion, power.

34:36.109 --> 34:38.745
That techno-rock
you guys listen to is gutless.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.112
I'm sure.

34:43.217 --> 34:44.985
Fred, that's my leg!

34:46.119 --> 34:49.056
You guys think
you're so different, don't you?

34:49.156 --> 34:52.324
-We are. We're ourselves.
-And we're not?

34:52.826 --> 34:55.428
You're like her
and all the rest of her friends.

34:55.462 --> 34:57.697
You're all fucking programmed.

34:58.665 --> 35:02.469
-So what does it take to be so free?
-That's a good question.

35:07.140 --> 35:09.276
So when can I see you again?

35:09.609 --> 35:12.212
-Thank you.
-Really, Randy...

35:12.479 --> 35:16.183
why don't you wait until
the end of the evening to say these things?

35:17.517 --> 35:20.153
It's the way I feel. It's what I want.

35:20.754 --> 35:22.756
All right, we're going to play a song.

35:22.889 --> 35:24.992
It's called A Million Miles AwaY.

35:28.428 --> 35:30.130
I'm here with you now.

35:30.964 --> 35:32.365
I know.

35:38.872 --> 35:41.375
It's like I can't explain it, you know?

35:42.242 --> 35:45.212
It's like my brains won't stop going.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.515
You know?

35:51.051 --> 35:52.119
Yeah?

35:58.158 --> 36:01.661
It's like I feel connected to you somehow.

36:03.330 --> 36:04.964
It's like I'm....

36:06.332 --> 36:10.803
It's like we're linked, or something.
I'm starting to sound like my parents.

36:55.815 --> 37:00.287
Steve, honey, come on. Stop worrying.
She's going to be all right.

37:01.020 --> 37:03.490
Remember our night in the cemetery?

37:15.568 --> 37:19.172
God! You are so weird. Go away.

37:19.739 --> 37:21.341
My little pickle.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.878
My darling.

37:26.646 --> 37:30.150
-This is so embarrassing.
-I think you're cute.

37:32.018 --> 37:33.052
God!

37:53.974 --> 37:56.876
Look, I just hope I can see you again.

37:56.943 --> 37:58.945
Why not? I thought you liked me.

38:00.013 --> 38:01.114
For sure.

38:02.482 --> 38:03.583
Well?

38:04.417 --> 38:07.620
My friends will freak, you know?

38:07.954 --> 38:10.523
None of us have had a dude
outside of school.

38:10.590 --> 38:13.326
Fuck 'em. Be the first one on your block.

38:13.726 --> 38:16.296
Do you always have to talk like that?

38:18.030 --> 38:20.867
-My darling.
-You're so weird.

38:20.967 --> 38:23.036
I want to see you tomorrow.

38:23.302 --> 38:26.939
You can't. I have to work,
if you can believe that.

38:27.607 --> 38:29.141
It's so uncool.

38:30.943 --> 38:32.612
Where do you work?

38:32.879 --> 38:34.681
In my parents' store.

38:35.481 --> 38:38.551
-What kind of a store?
-It's a store, you know?

38:38.785 --> 38:41.521
I know, a store. What do you sell?

38:42.188 --> 38:43.689
Health foods.

38:45.325 --> 38:46.693
That's cool.

38:46.726 --> 38:49.729
It's not. It's so uncool.

38:50.563 --> 38:53.065
Why couldn't they own
a Pizza Hut, or something?

38:58.204 --> 38:59.272
God!

39:10.449 --> 39:13.052
-I have to go home now.
-You don't.

39:14.954 --> 39:16.489
Come on!

39:29.201 --> 39:33.439
-My parents must be up, I'm sure.
-Are you going to get into trouble?

39:33.539 --> 39:35.274
They're pretty cool.

39:36.175 --> 39:38.477
But I've never done this before.

39:40.112 --> 39:41.514
I better go.

39:57.296 --> 39:59.365
I want to see you tomorrow.

40:10.843 --> 40:14.380
-Julie, is that you?
-Yeah, Mom, it's me. Sorry.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.416
We have been worried sick about you.

40:16.482 --> 40:19.352
Where have you been,
that you'd have to stay out all night?

40:19.418 --> 40:23.623
-I don't think I want to hear this.
-We have no secrets in this family.

40:23.989 --> 40:27.927
We know you're at an age now
where boys are more important...

40:27.993 --> 40:30.730
and nature plays its little part
in the scheme of life.

40:30.830 --> 40:34.167
-What am I talking about? I'm sure--
-God! Get serious.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.168
I was out all night, but I didn't--

40:36.235 --> 40:38.771
-You don't have to.... Cool it.
-Julie, listen.

40:38.871 --> 40:43.142
What your father is trying to say, dear,
is whatever you do is all right with us...

40:43.208 --> 40:45.678
as long as it doesn't hurt you,
or anyone else.

40:45.712 --> 40:47.179
-Right.
-Wait, Mom, I just--

40:47.246 --> 40:50.183
You see, we just want you
to be careful and responsible.

40:50.249 --> 40:52.418
Your mother and I worry about you, honey.

40:52.518 --> 40:56.689
It's not fair, with all the creepy-crawlers
out there, and everything.

40:56.789 --> 40:59.225
-I'm just going to bed now.
-Wait a minute.

40:59.291 --> 41:02.094
We were young once.
Your mother still is. We understand.

41:02.161 --> 41:04.831
-This isn't the Age of Aquarius.
-I would that it were.

41:04.897 --> 41:07.733
Why don't you just punish me
like Stacey's parents do?

41:07.800 --> 41:08.901
Bad karma, dear.

41:22.315 --> 41:23.483
-Guess what?
-What?

41:23.549 --> 41:26.919
Skip asked for my phone number.
God, I hope he calls.

41:26.986 --> 41:30.623
-Fasten your seat belt.
-God, I hate these things.

41:30.723 --> 41:32.925
They totally ruin the crease in my pants.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.928
Make sure you're in park, then turn the key.

41:36.095 --> 41:38.831
Where did you guys disappear to
the other night?

41:39.832 --> 41:41.167
Let Julie concentrate.

41:41.200 --> 41:45.003
Let Julie drive.
You don't want to be part of the pavement.

41:45.071 --> 41:47.439
I have the right to know. It was my party.

41:47.507 --> 41:49.675
Suzi, I mean, I didn't feel good.

41:49.742 --> 41:52.444
I almost barfed from all that sushi,
you know?

41:52.478 --> 41:54.046
And Julie took me home.

41:54.113 --> 41:55.547
Cut the chatter, girls.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.883
I want you to know you're my best friends.

41:57.917 --> 42:00.586
-Eyes forward, Julie.
-Tell us quick, who is he?

42:00.686 --> 42:03.622
-He was at the party.
-Eyes forward, mouth shut.

42:03.722 --> 42:06.926
-Who is it? Brad was there the whole night--
-Who is it, Julie?

42:06.959 --> 42:09.128
-Randy.
-Who's Randy?

42:09.995 --> 42:13.632
-He's the most awesome dude ever.
-Where was I when he was around?

42:13.732 --> 42:15.434
Where were you?

42:16.268 --> 42:19.071
-You don't mean that guy--
-Cut the conversation, girls.

42:19.171 --> 42:21.006
He's that guy from Hollywood.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.842
He came back for Stacey and me...

42:22.908 --> 42:25.578
and took us back over the hill.
We had a super time.

42:25.644 --> 42:28.080
I mean, your party was super and all.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.649
Man, he's just like trippin'-dicular,
you know?

42:30.716 --> 42:33.486
-Wasn't he, Stacey?
-You die, Richman.

42:33.686 --> 42:36.889
Straighten out!
You can't go through there. Stop!

42:38.357 --> 42:42.327
You'll be in big trouble if this gets around.
What if Tommy finds out?

42:42.394 --> 42:45.698
-So what?
-You've got a reputation to protect.

42:45.998 --> 42:47.233
Don't we all?

42:52.438 --> 42:53.538
Fail.

42:54.640 --> 42:57.242
Dump the Sohio at 34 and one eighth.

42:57.342 --> 43:00.112
Sure. Did you net in the cocoa futures?

43:01.079 --> 43:03.215
-Today would be great.
-Delivery.

43:03.282 --> 43:04.483
Hold on.

43:04.783 --> 43:08.287
Come on in. The gate's open.
I'll get right back to you.

43:15.127 --> 43:16.395
Hi, Mrs. Brent.

43:17.562 --> 43:20.565
-Skip. From the party.
-I know.

43:21.533 --> 43:23.335
Skip. From the party.

43:23.869 --> 43:27.239
Don't stand there holding those.
Put them down.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.541
Put them down there.

43:36.081 --> 43:38.617
-You had a good time, I hope?
-Ma'am?

43:38.951 --> 43:42.254
-You enjoyed yourself at the party?
-Yes, ma'am.

43:46.258 --> 43:48.861
I'm a little bit disappointed in you.

43:49.828 --> 43:53.665
-Ma'am?
-We talked quite a bit at the party...

43:54.766 --> 43:56.535
and I watched you....

43:57.803 --> 44:01.373
I believe in being direct. How about you?

44:03.909 --> 44:07.846
Just tell me exactly what you're thinking.

44:09.514 --> 44:11.717
Say, "Beth, l...."

44:16.988 --> 44:18.089
Okay.

44:21.827 --> 44:25.864
It's no accident
that I'm the one delivering the groceries.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.602
That's a start.

44:33.038 --> 44:34.272
I guess so.

44:35.473 --> 44:38.576
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Sure.

44:38.744 --> 44:40.412
I mean, no.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.782
I've still got a few more deliveries to make.

44:43.882 --> 44:46.384
I've really got to get back to work.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.220
That was quick.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.792
I've got a little tip for you, Skip.

44:54.926 --> 44:56.795
You got to be kidding.

44:57.228 --> 44:58.464
Plastics.

45:02.300 --> 45:06.538
The time to do something
is when the time is right.

45:12.311 --> 45:13.679
What time is it?

45:18.550 --> 45:22.955
Actually, it's almost time
for Suzi to get home.

45:27.992 --> 45:30.795
-I guess I see what you mean.
-Good.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.933
If nothing else, we've learned that.

45:39.638 --> 45:41.239
Don't be a stranger.

45:43.075 --> 45:44.209
'Bye.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.347
-'Bye.
-See ya.

45:50.749 --> 45:51.950
See ya.

45:54.786 --> 45:56.421
A Red Zinger tea.

45:57.022 --> 45:59.424
A Bombay Avocado Delight.

45:59.791 --> 46:02.995
And a cup of wheatgrass juice.

46:03.161 --> 46:05.831
Okay. Would you like some bean sprouts?

46:05.997 --> 46:09.767
Steve, we're out of the A, the B-12,
and the D, and the C.

46:09.835 --> 46:12.471
-I think there's some B-1 2 in the back.
-Okay.

46:13.038 --> 46:15.640
-What?
-There go the water buffaloes.

46:16.074 --> 46:17.976
They are kind of old, dear.

46:18.043 --> 46:21.079
Beg your pardon.
I got these for Woodstock, remember?

46:21.146 --> 46:22.947
Or was it the march on Washington?

46:23.015 --> 46:26.117
That was almost 14 years ago,
and you were right the first time.

46:26.218 --> 46:29.454
-You got the Earth shoes for Washington.
-Right, the Earth shoes.

46:29.521 --> 46:31.456
-Are you sure?
-Positive, dear.

46:31.523 --> 46:33.925
Remember? You were going to do
a lot of walking?

46:33.992 --> 46:35.794
You're right.

46:36.361 --> 46:38.563
I think I'll go get the B-12.

46:43.101 --> 46:45.870
God, this stuff is so gross.
How could people eat that?

46:45.937 --> 46:48.940
Because it isn't greasy,
doesn't mean it's bad for you, dodo.

46:49.006 --> 46:50.074
It's yuck.

46:51.175 --> 46:52.443
You're a yuck.

46:53.978 --> 46:56.114
Oh, my God, I'm going to die!

46:58.450 --> 47:02.120
-What are you doing? Are you all right?
-I'm humiliated to the max.

47:03.855 --> 47:05.490
-Hi.
-Hi.

47:10.094 --> 47:13.064
-Randy, this is my dad.
-Steve Richman.

47:14.298 --> 47:17.335
-What's happening? How's it going?
-Fine. How are you doing?

47:17.402 --> 47:18.603
Great.

47:18.737 --> 47:20.572
-That's great.
-He wants a sandwich.

47:20.638 --> 47:22.374
Right, okay.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.945
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

47:27.011 --> 47:29.981
-But why here?
-What's wrong with this place?

47:30.482 --> 47:31.582
This place is gross.

47:31.650 --> 47:35.019
All this stuff that tastes like nothing,
but is so good for you.

47:35.086 --> 47:36.588
What about the sprouts?

47:38.222 --> 47:40.258
Did you get in trouble the other night?

47:40.325 --> 47:42.194
-For what?
-Coming home so late.

47:42.260 --> 47:44.729
-No.
-Didn't your parents find out?

47:44.830 --> 47:46.898
Yeah, they were waiting up.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.900
-Don't they care?
-Sure they care...

47:48.933 --> 47:52.103
but I'm supposed to develop
into my own person, you know?

47:54.272 --> 47:56.141
That sounds good.

47:56.908 --> 47:58.209
How about a Coke?

47:58.309 --> 48:01.746
Sorry, my dad said
they supported the war effort...

48:01.813 --> 48:04.181
and it rots the enzymes in your stomach.

48:06.017 --> 48:08.586
-That sounds good to me.
-Right.

48:13.791 --> 48:16.794
-Let's get out of here.
-Don't you have to work?

48:16.861 --> 48:18.496
I've got flexible hours.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.232
See you, Dad.

48:21.299 --> 48:22.901
Bye-bye, sweetie.

48:23.568 --> 48:25.737
Come up with any new gizmos?

48:25.803 --> 48:28.339
We got some new stuff.
You can take a look at it.

48:28.373 --> 48:30.174
Honey, where's Julie?

48:30.675 --> 48:33.111
-She left with Randy.
-Who's Randy?

48:33.978 --> 48:37.449
I think he's that dude
she was out with the other night.

48:37.549 --> 48:40.552
Do you think
we should talk to her about this?

48:40.885 --> 48:43.755
-I don't know.
-Maybe I should talk to her.

52:15.866 --> 52:17.534
So, where's Julie?

52:18.635 --> 52:20.838
We haven't seen much of her
in the last week.

52:20.905 --> 52:23.541
She doesn't have time
for her friends anymore.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.277
I can't believe that.
You guys were such good friends.

52:26.343 --> 52:29.380
-What's with her?
-It's more like who's with her.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.349
I mean, this guy, Randy,
is filling her head with air.

52:32.416 --> 52:36.053
I nominated her for class rep,
and she wasn't even there.

52:36.153 --> 52:38.355
If she'd listen to me, I'd set her straight.

52:38.422 --> 52:40.791
You girls are her friends, you should try.

52:40.857 --> 52:44.561
She dumped me.
Far be it for me to interfere with her life.

52:44.795 --> 52:48.632
You're right, Tommy.
She did dump you and your advice, buddy.

52:48.699 --> 52:53.003
Go on and laugh. I still love that girl.
I know how to make her happy....

52:55.105 --> 52:58.309
This geek that she's with
could scar her for life.

52:58.442 --> 53:00.444
God. For life?

53:02.313 --> 53:04.481
No. Come on, Suzi.

53:06.884 --> 53:08.285
What is it with Loryn?

53:30.407 --> 53:34.011
What's going on? Way to go, spaz!

53:34.077 --> 53:37.481
-I didn't mean to do it, spaz.
-Get lost.

53:41.752 --> 53:44.488
She's always into everything, you know?

53:44.688 --> 53:47.357
Suzi, it's a total bummer
when you're young...

53:47.457 --> 53:49.726
and you don't even know why you're here.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.161
Yeah, I mean....

53:51.228 --> 53:54.197
Okay, this one is so tubular.

53:54.998 --> 53:57.334
Suzi, pass the chips, will you?

53:58.568 --> 54:00.937
Can you, like, grow some more zits?

54:01.071 --> 54:04.875
No, but I thought
maybe I could borrow some of yours, okay?

54:06.410 --> 54:09.246
My thighs just grow, looking at that stuff.

54:10.680 --> 54:14.084
-What can you do?
-You chew them up and spit them out.

54:14.618 --> 54:15.752
How gross!

54:15.852 --> 54:18.288
People do that to stay skinny.
It's very serious.

54:18.355 --> 54:21.492
Cindy Boo lost 90 pounds,
and even, like, scarfed on ice cream.

54:21.558 --> 54:25.596
-Are you serious? No way.
-Yeah, you know, like, splurge and purge?

54:25.996 --> 54:27.931
Or, like, scarf and barf.

54:28.665 --> 54:31.735
-Very immature.
-I'll start my diet tomorrow.

54:31.802 --> 54:35.739
You better watch out.
Randy might like the Hollywood lean look.

54:35.806 --> 54:38.542
Yeah, but blimps don't get to go
with Tommy.

54:38.608 --> 54:39.643
Who?

54:40.144 --> 54:41.544
-Tommy.
-Who?

54:44.548 --> 54:45.816
Fuck him.

54:48.518 --> 54:51.488
Girls, we must fuck him.

54:54.891 --> 54:57.427
What is that little brat doing?

54:57.494 --> 55:00.030
-Give me the chips.
-Sorry.

55:08.271 --> 55:11.708
-Not too cool, all right, Peggy?
-I am, too, cool.

55:11.775 --> 55:14.144
Your mom is so bitchin', Suzi.

55:14.211 --> 55:17.180
Put that back, Loryn.
You're too small for that.

55:17.247 --> 55:20.617
I am not too small. I look totally hot in this.

55:21.751 --> 55:23.854
No man could resist my....

55:25.188 --> 55:27.223
-What do you call it?
-Your tits.

55:27.824 --> 55:29.592
Put that stuff back.

55:31.427 --> 55:36.333
-Do you think Randy will like me in this?
-Yeah, if it was made out of black leather.

55:36.733 --> 55:41.705
Tommy's going to look real good
after six grody bus rides into Hollywood.

55:41.771 --> 55:44.675
Like, all those sweaty bods. Barf me out.

55:44.707 --> 55:47.411
You'll really get off
hearing about all the parties.

55:47.511 --> 55:48.679
What do you mean?

55:48.711 --> 55:51.948
Because you'll never be able to go to any,
as long as you got Randy.

55:52.015 --> 55:54.217
Don't you think they have parties
over there?

55:54.317 --> 55:56.052
Where, at the zoo?

55:56.152 --> 55:58.755
You can just kiss class rep good-bye.

55:59.556 --> 56:01.324
Big deal, okay?

56:07.998 --> 56:09.166
Hello?

56:10.300 --> 56:12.869
Who is this? Hi, Skip.

56:12.936 --> 56:14.904
I was hoping you'd call.

56:16.306 --> 56:18.474
My mom said she saw you the other day.

56:18.542 --> 56:21.645
-She did?
-Yeah. She thinks you're all right.

56:21.711 --> 56:22.946
She does?

56:24.714 --> 56:27.450
-Tell him to come over.
-Go for it!

56:28.385 --> 56:30.353
Why don't you come over?

56:35.425 --> 56:36.960
My mom is gone.

56:37.827 --> 56:39.429
Oh, yeah? For how long?

56:39.996 --> 56:41.931
For most of the night.

56:42.031 --> 56:44.301
Maybe all night. She's out on a date.

56:46.402 --> 56:48.505
What do you say?

56:49.639 --> 56:50.674
I can't.

56:51.708 --> 56:54.478
My mom's got a lot of stuff
for me to do around here.

56:55.111 --> 56:57.146
I was just calling to say hi and all.

56:57.246 --> 56:59.682
You know, see what you're up to.

57:00.116 --> 57:02.318
-I'll talk to you later, okay?
-When?

57:03.353 --> 57:05.855
Jeez, I don't know. Later, I guess.

57:06.055 --> 57:07.157
Okay.

57:10.927 --> 57:12.929
Okay. Good-bye.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.201
A date.

57:18.969 --> 57:22.005
-Do you think he likes me?
-He called you, didn't he?

57:22.538 --> 57:25.141
You know the type. He's shy.

57:25.341 --> 57:28.244
I could die. He's so buff.

57:29.045 --> 57:32.782
-I know he likes you.
-Like the way Randy likes you?

57:33.082 --> 57:34.717
For sure, Stacey.

57:34.751 --> 57:38.454
You know, Julie, you can
kiss all the bitchin' Val dudes good-bye.

57:38.521 --> 57:40.256
Like I really care.

57:41.625 --> 57:45.461
I hear there's something really grody
about the air in Hollywood.

57:45.661 --> 57:48.197
And the guys, they only get to be that big.

57:48.297 --> 57:49.966
-ls that true?
-Yeah.

57:50.066 --> 57:54.237
-What's the biggest one you've ever seen?
-Like in the National Geographic, or what?

57:54.304 --> 57:55.638
No, in your hand.

57:55.705 --> 57:58.241
Damn it. God!

59:02.104 --> 59:03.272
Hello?

59:06.208 --> 59:07.944
It's me, Skip.

59:09.879 --> 59:12.582
I'm just returning one of Suzi's books.

59:21.557 --> 59:23.025
Jesus Christ.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.632
What do you think?

01:00:04.433 --> 01:00:08.304
Everybody thinks
Tommy is so tubular and all, you know?

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:10.172
So you think I should pick Tommy.

01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:16.011
What I mean is, if you were
to get back together with Tommy...

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.248
do you think things would be better?

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.651
You mean I should pick Randy?

01:00:22.184 --> 01:00:24.453
I don't know about that.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.992
What I'm trying to say....

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:34.030
It's really hard for me to say
what I'm trying to say.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.667
Loryn, this isn't helping me.
I don't know what to do about this.

01:00:39.368 --> 01:00:40.570
Me, either.

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:40.062
-Oh, shit.
-Mom.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:42.731
What's up?

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.770
I got this problem,
and I don't know what to do about it.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.072
Yeah? That's easy.

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:54.944
Take it back and get a more expensive one.
The expensive ones always fit better, honey.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:56.045
Dad.

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:59.248
That's not it? All right, what is it?

01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:03.352
You know, this is really hard.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.821
All right.

01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:07.857
Shoot.

01:02:09.491 --> 01:02:12.794
I like Randy a lot, you know?

01:02:14.096 --> 01:02:15.631
He's different.

01:02:15.697 --> 01:02:19.034
What, he was in an accident?
Things don't work the way they should?

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.069
-No!
-I saw a movie like that, once.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.371
Did you?

01:02:22.671 --> 01:02:25.073
-All right. How is he different?
-I don't know.

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:28.777
He doesn't dress like my friends,
or even talk like them.

01:02:29.678 --> 01:02:30.813
I see.

01:02:31.713 --> 01:02:33.515
Is that wrong?

01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:37.620
My friends think so.

01:02:39.354 --> 01:02:40.789
That's important?

01:02:41.423 --> 01:02:42.891
Sure, I guess.

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:46.762
-I don't want to lose them.
-Of course not.

01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:49.832
And they all want me to be with Tommy.

01:02:52.234 --> 01:02:55.837
-What do you want?
-I want to be with Randy.

01:02:57.239 --> 01:03:00.309
It's getting hard. I don't want any problems.

01:03:00.642 --> 01:03:04.079
There's the rub, you see? Nothing's easy.

01:03:04.146 --> 01:03:06.048
I want to show you something.

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:11.186
You see, honey,
sometimes the way things look...

01:03:12.354 --> 01:03:14.189
aren't the way they really are...

01:03:14.289 --> 01:03:16.859
or the way they're going to turn out.

01:03:16.992 --> 01:03:18.126
Here.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.997
I don't think you ever saw these.

01:03:24.032 --> 01:03:27.302
-Are these you?
-Yep, that's me.

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:31.840
-Who's this?
-She's a friend of mine.

01:03:31.873 --> 01:03:33.876
Before I met your mother.

01:03:33.942 --> 01:03:37.245
Not everyone looked or dressed like that
back then.

01:03:37.612 --> 01:03:40.316
In fact, lots of people didn't look like that.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:44.653
I can believe that.
I don't think Randy's ever looked this bad.

01:03:44.753 --> 01:03:48.724
The point is,
what difference does it all make?

01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:53.128
The way you look, the kinds of clothes
you wear on your body....

01:03:53.195 --> 01:03:57.532
It's what you are that counts,
what's inside you, what you stand for...

01:03:58.133 --> 01:04:00.836
not what other people want to make you.

01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:03.639
Honey, there are lots of people out there...

01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:08.243
who ain't happy unless you live and think
the same way they do.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:10.245
And if you don't....

01:04:13.047 --> 01:04:15.951
-You dig what I'm saying?
-I know all about that stuff.

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:18.854
But which one do I pick?

01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:21.323
Randy or Tommy.

01:04:22.257 --> 01:04:25.327
Beats me, love,
but let me know when you decide.

01:04:26.127 --> 01:04:27.529
-Okay?
-Okay.

01:04:56.658 --> 01:04:58.560
-Hi, Julie.
-Hi.

01:04:58.627 --> 01:04:59.828
-How are you?
-Good.

01:05:09.504 --> 01:05:13.007
This has been too tough, you know?
It's not really fair.

01:05:13.108 --> 01:05:15.243
It's either Randy, or you guys.

01:05:15.343 --> 01:05:17.212
Life's not fair.

01:05:20.215 --> 01:05:22.617
Randy is totally special to me, Stacey...

01:05:23.752 --> 01:05:25.854
and I don't understand why.

01:05:27.188 --> 01:05:30.125
I mean, he doesn't do
the things we like to do...

01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:35.263
-but--
-Julie, you left out one possibility:

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:37.466
totally gnarly sex.

01:05:38.033 --> 01:05:40.068
It hasn't gotten that far.

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:45.774
I know everyone is counting on me
to do the right things.

01:05:45.874 --> 01:05:47.209
So did you?

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:52.414
I don't know.

01:05:53.748 --> 01:05:56.018
But it was fun while it lasted.

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:58.453
So you've done the right thing.

01:05:58.553 --> 01:06:01.823
I don't know, you guys,
being popular can be so lonely.

01:06:02.524 --> 01:06:04.759
It doesn't have to be, Stacey.

01:06:04.826 --> 01:06:08.096
What am I going to do?
I kissed Tommy off in a major way.

01:06:08.196 --> 01:06:11.333
Forget that. I mean, Tommy is such a hunk.

01:06:11.933 --> 01:06:14.636
He told us he still loves you a bunch.

01:06:15.337 --> 01:06:17.338
He did? When?

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:20.074
He just said it one day, you know?

01:06:20.942 --> 01:06:23.345
Just make up with him. He'll take you back.

01:06:24.579 --> 01:06:28.150
-He's got to be bummed to the max with me.
-He'll get over it.

01:06:28.717 --> 01:06:32.354
Hey, you know, why break up
the most bitchin' couple at school?

01:06:32.387 --> 01:06:35.690
I mean, Tommy can't be king of the prom
going stag.

01:06:36.057 --> 01:06:38.025
He's got his position to worry about.

01:06:39.027 --> 01:06:40.962
Okay, I'll talk to him.

01:06:41.229 --> 01:06:43.231
Are you sure he wants me back, though?

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:45.901
Of course. I just told you so.

01:06:46.234 --> 01:06:49.237
Hey, Julie, I asked Arthur to the prom.

01:06:49.304 --> 01:06:51.005
What'd he say?

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:53.675
He goes, "Okay."

01:06:55.877 --> 01:06:57.445
-Hi, Tommy.
-Hi.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.148
I gotta go.

01:07:00.214 --> 01:07:03.251
I've got all this homework
I forgot about. Come on, Loryn.

01:07:03.317 --> 01:07:04.785
-See you, Julie.
-Bye-bye.

01:07:04.886 --> 01:07:06.788
-'Bye, Julie.
-See ya.

01:07:16.497 --> 01:07:19.467
-How you been?
-I've been getting by, I guess.

01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:21.035
You?

01:07:21.236 --> 01:07:22.470
All right.

01:07:22.537 --> 01:07:25.840
How's your new boyfriend?
What's-his-name?

01:07:28.443 --> 01:07:29.811
It's over.

01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:34.849
He wasn't mean to you, was he?

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:38.920
If he was, I'll go kick his ass sideways.
I did it once, I'll do it again.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:43.057
It wasn't that.
It was just that he was different, that's all.

01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:48.896
Is this what you want?

01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:06.180
Listen, Doug's got his dad's Mercedes.

01:08:06.247 --> 01:08:08.449
We're gonna cruise Van Nuys.
You wanna go?

01:08:08.516 --> 01:08:10.885
-Sure, I guess.
-All right.

01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:16.756
Can I have some of your hamburger?

01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:18.960
You can.

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:52.093
-Hey, babe.
-Randy.

01:08:54.428 --> 01:08:57.298
-What's the matter with you?
-Why didn't you call me first?

01:08:58.131 --> 01:09:00.935
It slipped my mind.
I didn't think it was that important.

01:09:01.035 --> 01:09:05.506
But I will tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna reach in my pocket, get a dime...

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:09.377
go down to the phone booth, make a call,
come right back up, and talk to you.

01:09:09.477 --> 01:09:11.746
Why do you always barge in like that?

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:15.349
-You shouldn't talk like that.
-Don't tell me what to do.

01:09:16.617 --> 01:09:19.019
You have no control over my life.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.389
I can see anybody I want to, okay?

01:09:22.223 --> 01:09:23.558
I'm sorry.

01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:27.361
I didn't think it was that big a deal.

01:09:29.196 --> 01:09:30.965
Look, I have to go to bed now.

01:09:32.233 --> 01:09:34.035
Hey, come over here.

01:09:35.303 --> 01:09:36.703
I love you.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:40.073
That's all I wanted to say.

01:09:42.176 --> 01:09:43.578
I love you.

01:09:45.679 --> 01:09:47.948
So, when can I see you.... Hey.

01:09:49.683 --> 01:09:51.719
When can I see you again?

01:09:55.823 --> 01:09:58.159
-You can't.
-What?

01:09:58.226 --> 01:10:01.262
Don't do that to me!
You can't see me anymore.

01:10:01.362 --> 01:10:04.598
Is it your father or mother?
Let me talk to them. I can fix things.

01:10:04.665 --> 01:10:06.834
There's nothing to fix. It's not them.

01:10:06.901 --> 01:10:09.403
It's not them at all. It's me, okay?

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.972
I can't see you anymore, okay?

01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:13.040
Okay.

01:10:16.677 --> 01:10:18.178
I know what it is.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.950
I know what this is.
It's your fucking friends, right?

01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:25.619
Shit, Julie, what is this?
It's between you and me...

01:10:25.719 --> 01:10:29.190
not between the rest of the fucking world.
So fuck off!

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:32.126
It's your friends.

01:10:33.627 --> 01:10:34.929
Fuck you!

01:10:37.365 --> 01:10:40.234
Fuck off, for sure! Like, totally!

01:11:15.769 --> 01:11:18.773
I don't fucking care. I don't give a fuck.

01:11:22.443 --> 01:11:24.378
I don't fucking care, man.

01:11:28.215 --> 01:11:31.085
-Randy? You look like shit.
-Hey, how you doing?

01:11:31.151 --> 01:11:33.721
-I shouldn't let you in here.
-You been doing good?

01:11:33.821 --> 01:11:36.290
-Come on.
-All right. That's what I want.

01:12:18.999 --> 01:12:20.668
You feel so good.

01:12:22.102 --> 01:12:23.737
Hello, Samantha.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.809
I've been looking for you tonight.

01:12:28.842 --> 01:12:30.978
Liar. You haven't been looking for me...

01:12:31.044 --> 01:12:34.048
and I haven't been looking for you
in two months now.

01:12:35.082 --> 01:12:37.651
You're right. But here we are.

01:12:45.492 --> 01:12:48.128
Did I ever tell you how good you feel?

01:12:49.062 --> 01:12:50.864
You did tell me that.

01:13:01.575 --> 01:13:03.076
Let's make up.

01:13:05.679 --> 01:13:07.848
You want to make up some more?

01:13:30.504 --> 01:13:32.272
Your place or mine?

01:14:32.399 --> 01:14:34.167
How about a cigarette?

01:14:35.635 --> 01:14:37.237
How about a sip?

01:14:38.271 --> 01:14:40.007
What's he getting?

01:14:43.877 --> 01:14:45.879
-Who's that?
-Don't know.

01:15:41.001 --> 01:15:42.535
Go home, Randy.

01:15:54.948 --> 01:15:57.250
Hey, puto, want a light?

01:15:58.485 --> 01:16:00.953
Fuck you, scum! Get out of the car.

01:16:01.021 --> 01:16:03.423
-Are you bad at me?
-Yeah, I'm bad.

01:16:03.523 --> 01:16:06.860
-Get out of the fucking car, shit.
-Are you bad, man?

01:16:06.926 --> 01:16:09.662
-Get out of the car.
-I'll show you bad.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.669
Come on, keep going!

01:16:25.512 --> 01:16:27.914
-Hey, man.
-What are you doing?

01:16:28.849 --> 01:16:32.352
You're a dumb son of a bitch, man.
Guys like that'll kill you.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.889
I don't give.... Fuck 'em.
Just leave me alone.

01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:40.260
-What the hell's the matter with you?
-Fuck you, too.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.797
Hey, man, who're you talking to?
It's me, Bailey.

01:16:45.098 --> 01:16:47.066
You're shitfaced.

01:16:47.533 --> 01:16:49.402
I don't feel so good.

01:16:50.804 --> 01:16:52.105
I'm going to be sick.

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:56.576
Go on. Leave me alone!

01:17:02.549 --> 01:17:04.617
Go on, now, leave me alone.

01:17:05.985 --> 01:17:09.222
Leave you alone? Why?
So you can feel sorry for yourself...

01:17:09.322 --> 01:17:13.025
because some little Valley chick
wanted somebody else, is that it?

01:17:26.272 --> 01:17:29.242
Hit me with that brick. I'm dying.

01:17:29.508 --> 01:17:32.512
-Just put me out of my misery.
-Come on, man.

01:17:35.315 --> 01:17:37.116
Man, you smell fucking awful.

01:17:41.254 --> 01:17:42.722
Screw it, man.

01:17:43.423 --> 01:17:46.626
-You gonna make me feel great?
-Come off that, man.

01:17:47.927 --> 01:17:50.563
Look, if you want this girl so bad...

01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:53.600
why don't you do something about it?

01:17:55.034 --> 01:17:56.402
I mean...

01:17:56.936 --> 01:17:59.872
go for the wild, crazy stuff.

01:18:04.277 --> 01:18:06.112
-Wild and crazy.
-Yeah.

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.548
Don't tell me that.

01:18:09.582 --> 01:18:14.053
Come on, man. It's romantic shit.
Girls love that stuff, you know?

01:18:16.222 --> 01:18:19.191
Trust me. It never fails.

01:18:21.094 --> 01:18:22.328
I know.

01:18:38.177 --> 01:18:39.779
We have to talk.

01:18:40.246 --> 01:18:41.947
I told you we can't.

01:18:42.047 --> 01:18:44.083
-Young man....
-What?

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.219
Are you being held prisoner, or what?

01:18:46.252 --> 01:18:48.755
-Give me a signal.
-Get out of the car.

01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:52.058
-But I love you.
-Get out of the car!

01:18:54.894 --> 01:18:56.128
Let's go.

01:19:02.902 --> 01:19:05.971
You've just heard Men at Work.
We have more dedications tonight...

01:19:06.039 --> 01:19:08.541
to Billy from Dina. She says, "You're a fox. "

01:19:08.675 --> 01:19:11.377
Andrea to Doug, she'll do
"anything to get you back. "

01:19:11.744 --> 01:19:15.415
To Julie, his favorite Valley girl,
Randy sends his undying love, and says;

01:19:15.481 --> 01:19:17.917
"Like, come back soon, you know. "

01:19:22.655 --> 01:19:26.225
-I've got to get to Algebra. I'll see you later.
-Okay. See you.

01:19:51.283 --> 01:19:52.885
Enjoy your ride.

01:20:01.694 --> 01:20:04.497
-Oh, bitchin'. Is this in 3-D?
-No, but your face is.

01:20:04.563 --> 01:20:06.732
Like, I hate 3-D. It gives me a headache.

01:20:06.832 --> 01:20:08.367
It's not in 3-D.

01:20:09.335 --> 01:20:10.836
Have a nice flight.

01:20:13.973 --> 01:20:16.142
Good. Check this geek out.

01:20:16.409 --> 01:20:18.077
Who is this guy?

01:20:19.478 --> 01:20:23.149
I guess these go
right back down there now, don't they?

01:20:24.783 --> 01:20:26.652
How you doing down there?

01:20:27.553 --> 01:20:30.690
It appears you forgot
our French fries and Coke, fishhead.

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:35.094
Peter Piper picked a pepper,
I guess I did. I'm sorry.

01:20:35.194 --> 01:20:37.429
-That guy's nuts.
-What a geek!

01:21:01.086 --> 01:21:02.488
Oh, my God!

01:21:03.455 --> 01:21:07.025
Don't do that. Come on, Julie!

01:21:08.727 --> 01:21:10.229
Don't do this.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.503
-She's out there somewhere.
-Yep.

01:21:19.538 --> 01:21:21.607
What you're doing ain't working.

01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:23.342
You need a good plan.

01:21:23.609 --> 01:21:25.511
I didn't know that.

01:21:26.612 --> 01:21:30.949
Listen, if you're going to have
that kind of attitude, I won't even tell you.

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:35.254
Just forget I ever tried to save you
from your miserable existence.

01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:42.394
Okay, I'll tell you. Twist my arm.

01:21:43.696 --> 01:21:46.598
Listen, I got a plan...

01:21:47.165 --> 01:21:52.171
that's going to get you in solid with the
love of your life, and at the same time...

01:21:52.271 --> 01:21:57.008
achieve the grandest form of retribution
against the guy who kicked your ass.

01:21:57.876 --> 01:21:59.578
So he had a little help.

01:22:04.816 --> 01:22:06.118
Oh, man.

01:22:19.598 --> 01:22:22.200
Where are you and Arthur going?

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.503
We're going straight to the hot-tub club.

01:22:25.437 --> 01:22:29.274
Listen. We were on the waiting list,
and we got in.

01:22:29.375 --> 01:22:31.977
-Oh, my God.
-Where's Julie going with Tommy?

01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:35.080
I heard...

01:22:35.848 --> 01:22:38.650
Tommy made reservations
at the Valley Sheraton!

01:22:38.717 --> 01:22:41.387
Does she know?

01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:44.123
-No.
-No way!

01:22:51.964 --> 01:22:56.501
Far out. This kid doesn't miss a trick.
Sarah, you got to see this.

01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:00.839
Sarah! Lancelot's here!

01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:02.607
Not so loud, dear.

01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:07.579
Look at me. I'm probably more nervous
than the kids are. Look at these hands.

01:23:07.646 --> 01:23:10.048
I don't understand
what you're so nervous about.

01:23:10.082 --> 01:23:11.817
You act like it's your prom.

01:23:11.883 --> 01:23:14.186
I don't know. Feel these hands. They're wet.

01:23:14.687 --> 01:23:16.788
-Wow.
-Look at her.

01:23:16.855 --> 01:23:18.623
Look at you, honey.

01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:22.060
You look lovely, darling.

01:23:22.427 --> 01:23:23.695
Beautiful!

01:23:23.729 --> 01:23:26.031
That's Tommy. Quick, get the camera.

01:23:26.098 --> 01:23:28.333
We can't miss a moment of this. Hurry.

01:23:28.367 --> 01:23:29.868
What's the deal with him?

01:23:30.068 --> 01:23:32.771
I think your father
has just faced his mortality.

01:23:34.707 --> 01:23:38.510
You're both in pink, you just look beautiful.

01:23:38.944 --> 01:23:41.813
Steve! Hurry up, dear! Tommy's here.

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:47.753
Are you all right, honey?

01:23:49.287 --> 01:23:52.023
I'm coming. I'm looking for the camera.

01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:57.295
Just wait two more minutes. Steve will be
here in just one minute with the camera.

01:23:57.395 --> 01:23:59.798
We have to get a picture of this.
We really do.

01:24:01.032 --> 01:24:02.534
Hurry up, dear!

01:24:07.306 --> 01:24:10.242
-Here he is.
-Hi, Tommy. How you doing, man?

01:24:10.275 --> 01:24:11.743
Mighty spiffy.

01:24:11.843 --> 01:24:13.978
Look at them. Are they a picture?

01:24:14.078 --> 01:24:18.417
We got to get a picture of this.
I still got film in here from the wedding.

01:24:18.483 --> 01:24:21.286
-What wedding?
-They were married last September.

01:24:21.353 --> 01:24:23.955
-Newlyweds.
-Can't be too careful.

01:24:25.123 --> 01:24:27.726
Okay, let's get some snapperoos here.

01:24:27.859 --> 01:24:29.862
Dad. Earth to Dad.

01:24:30.162 --> 01:24:32.831
Imagine that. The old lens cap.

01:24:33.365 --> 01:24:35.166
-Okay, here we go.
-Closer.

01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:38.637
No stopping us now. Get closer together.
Give us a big smile, Tommy.

01:24:38.703 --> 01:24:41.239
-Smile, come on. Closer.
-That's it. Not too much.

01:24:41.306 --> 01:24:44.742
-A little goes a long way with some people.
-I got to go.

01:24:47.479 --> 01:24:50.482
You look beautiful. Have a wonderful time.

01:24:50.549 --> 01:24:52.750
-Trust me.
-Me, too.

01:24:53.918 --> 01:24:55.053
'Bye!

01:24:57.389 --> 01:24:59.491
Come on. Let's go see 'em.

01:25:05.764 --> 01:25:07.198
Her first prom.

01:25:09.768 --> 01:25:11.002
Far out.

01:25:13.838 --> 01:25:15.674
Feeling better, dear?

01:25:17.175 --> 01:25:18.210
Yeah!

01:25:19.511 --> 01:25:21.213
You know...

01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:24.616
maybe we should have gone.

01:25:26.017 --> 01:25:28.486
I mean, how bad could it have been?

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.054
What?

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.328
Your prom.

01:25:39.197 --> 01:25:42.533
What is this, Bangkok?
I don't need a massage.

01:25:44.903 --> 01:25:47.405
Do you have any of that stuff for me?

01:25:48.673 --> 01:25:51.409
Sure. Come on. We'll light it up.

01:25:51.676 --> 01:25:54.813
-Are you ready to party?
-Yeah!

01:25:54.913 --> 01:25:58.917
Let's hear it.
Here's Josie Cotton and the Party Crashers!

01:26:34.852 --> 01:26:38.856
-You think this is something, wait till later.
-What do you mean?

01:26:51.436 --> 01:26:53.938
-I can't believe this.
-Shit.

01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.676
We should've shined up the wagon,
or cleaned out the back seat.

01:26:58.743 --> 01:27:01.179
-I'm doing the best I can.
-What is this?

01:27:01.245 --> 01:27:04.316
Did you clip butterflies' wings
as a kid? Maybe you still do.

01:27:04.382 --> 01:27:07.985
Listen, I told you, I've got a plan.
Enough said?

01:27:43.555 --> 01:27:46.724
This is it, Fred.
I'm rushing that birthday cake.

01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:50.995
Cool everything and listen.
This is all going like clockwork.

01:27:51.162 --> 01:27:55.099
I'm getting very excited about this.
So just hang on.

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.235
This will be a night we'll never forget.

01:27:58.303 --> 01:28:00.705
-Come on, what is it?
-You'll see.

01:28:06.277 --> 01:28:09.747
-They really are rather dissolute.
-Where are the cups?

01:28:09.847 --> 01:28:12.383
Miss Liebman, do you know
where the cups are?

01:28:12.483 --> 01:28:15.086
-I don't know where the cups are.
-Looking for the cups?

01:28:15.152 --> 01:28:18.089
-Mr. Brooks, do you know--
-I haven't seen cups all evening.

01:28:18.123 --> 01:28:21.926
Suzi was supposed to bring them,
but she never even showed up.

01:28:42.247 --> 01:28:43.615
Thank goodness.

01:28:44.949 --> 01:28:47.251
I think we should get out of here.

01:28:48.219 --> 01:28:52.890
Arthur, let's wait until after they announce
the king and queen at least, okay?

01:28:53.724 --> 01:28:54.726
Okay.

01:29:20.785 --> 01:29:22.386
Boys, how we doing?

01:29:22.453 --> 01:29:23.921
-Mr. Brooks.
-Hi, Mr. Brooks.

01:29:24.022 --> 01:29:26.257
-How's that punch?
-It's Bosco.

01:29:26.924 --> 01:29:29.093
I'd like to try some. Where are the cups?

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.928
Wow, there's no cups.

01:29:36.767 --> 01:29:38.269
A little flat.

01:29:58.089 --> 01:29:59.523
She's there.

01:30:00.457 --> 01:30:04.661
Suzi, where have you been?
Everybody's been waiting for the cups.

01:30:06.363 --> 01:30:09.166
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?

01:30:09.633 --> 01:30:12.503
-Have you been getting laid, Suzi?
-Loryn, just....

01:30:16.006 --> 01:30:17.541
Where's Ralphie?

01:30:17.608 --> 01:30:21.378
Indian wrestling with the boys,
or something totally grody like that.

01:30:21.445 --> 01:30:23.013
Wow. Sorry.

01:30:23.547 --> 01:30:27.051
It's cool. I'm not going to eat
anything now...

01:30:27.151 --> 01:30:30.488
so when we go to La Serre,
I can scarf up half the menu.

01:30:30.554 --> 01:30:33.357
-All right.
-Okay, 'bye.

01:30:39.063 --> 01:30:42.199
-Stacey. Check out this, dude.
-I don't want to see Stacey.

01:30:45.603 --> 01:30:48.339
That's it, Bailey. I've had it with you.

01:30:48.439 --> 01:30:52.276
-I didn't think her haircut was so bad.
-What do you mean, her haircut?

01:30:52.343 --> 01:30:55.112
I just want to know
the rest of this big plan of yours.

01:30:55.179 --> 01:30:58.816
What do you mean, "the rest"?
This is it. Simplicity at its finest.

01:31:03.353 --> 01:31:05.322
Simplicity at its finest?

01:31:06.357 --> 01:31:08.659
At least you got me here.

01:31:09.126 --> 01:31:10.528
So let's...

01:31:11.562 --> 01:31:13.964
crush that fly.

01:32:01.945 --> 01:32:03.313
Is this on?

01:32:06.484 --> 01:32:08.285
And now, students...

01:32:08.752 --> 01:32:11.055
the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

01:32:11.121 --> 01:32:14.558
the announcement of
the king and the queen of Valley High.

01:32:14.592 --> 01:32:17.328
What is being king and queen all about?

01:32:18.195 --> 01:32:21.031
Is it about who wears the nicest clothes?

01:32:22.499 --> 01:32:23.900
I think not.

01:32:25.302 --> 01:32:28.939
Is it about who's dating
the captain of the football team?

01:32:29.539 --> 01:32:32.175
Or who's seeing the head cheerleader?

01:32:32.876 --> 01:32:34.478
I don't think so.

01:32:34.711 --> 01:32:36.847
Is it a popularity contest?

01:32:38.081 --> 01:32:39.449
I doubt it.

01:32:39.616 --> 01:32:42.886
I'm going to give you the chance
you never gave me.

01:32:42.953 --> 01:32:46.490
...when one is honorable,
when one is disciplined...

01:32:46.556 --> 01:32:48.759
when one has school spirit.

01:32:50.294 --> 01:32:51.495
Yes...

01:32:52.463 --> 01:32:54.198
kings and queens...

01:32:54.498 --> 01:32:55.966
they don't grow on trees.

01:32:56.066 --> 01:32:57.167
Hold this.

01:32:57.267 --> 01:32:59.803
Everyone can't be a king and a queen.

01:33:00.637 --> 01:33:02.539
Let's go, boy. Get up.

01:33:04.007 --> 01:33:05.775
I remember my prom.

01:33:07.377 --> 01:33:09.379
I wanted to be the queen.

01:33:10.781 --> 01:33:11.848
I wasn't.

01:33:12.583 --> 01:33:14.384
Stop it!

01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.021
Watch this.

01:33:18.622 --> 01:33:22.826
...who have set an example
for our whole school with their behavior.

01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.763
They need no introduction...

01:33:25.863 --> 01:33:29.299
because they are not just
the king and queen of Valley High...

01:33:29.366 --> 01:33:31.201
they are Valley High.

01:33:31.902 --> 01:33:34.604
Your king. Your queen.

01:34:06.903 --> 01:34:08.972
Get your hands off me, you fucking dick.

01:34:15.378 --> 01:34:17.514
Julie, what's going on here?

01:35:06.362 --> 01:35:08.865
That must be some party
you got going there.

01:35:08.965 --> 01:35:10.033
Yeah.

01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:11.701
Valley Sheraton?

01:35:12.269 --> 01:35:13.503
Sir?

01:35:16.039 --> 01:35:17.107
Yeah.
