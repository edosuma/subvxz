00:01.368 --> 00:03.203
Tonight on "Shark Tank"...

00:03.203 --> 00:04.838
We are here to put an end
to this monkey business.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.840
This is genius.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.609
You just came out here
and bared your soul.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.643
I love you, dude.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.378
I need Sharks.
You need money.

00:11.378 --> 00:15.682
I was sitting for 20 minutes
asking for an answer.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.785
Are you starting a cult
or something?
No, not in any way.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.754
How the hell do I make money
with any of this crap?

00:20.754 --> 00:22.956
Royalties?
Noooo!

00:31.465 --> 00:33.901
First in the Tank
is a versatile workout system

00:33.901 --> 00:36.537
with on‐the‐go simplicity.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.146
Hello, Sharks.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.180
My name's Nezar,

00:47.180 --> 00:48.448
and I'm from
just outside Detroit,

00:48.448 --> 00:49.550
the Motor City.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.952
It's no secret
that health and fitness

00:51.952 --> 00:55.322
is extremely important
to many people around the world,

00:55.322 --> 00:58.992
yet inactivity and obesity
continue to rise,

00:58.992 --> 01:03.230
primarily due to limits on time,
space, will, motivation.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.799
At MAXPRO, we can help you
overcome those challenges

01:05.799 --> 01:09.836
by making fitness more fun
and accessible

01:09.836 --> 01:13.440
with our award‐winning,
first of its kind,

01:13.440 --> 01:16.643
extremely versatile
portable cable machine.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.845
Literally fits in a bag.

01:18.845 --> 01:21.548
This is
the MAXPRO SmartConnect.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.451
This amazing little
10‐pound machine

01:24.451 --> 01:29.389
gives you 5 pounds
to 300 pounds of resistance

01:29.389 --> 01:30.857
with a simple turn

01:30.857 --> 01:33.994
of our patent‐pending
power clutch dial ‐‐

01:33.994 --> 01:36.663
ready, easy to use
right out of the box.

01:36.663 --> 01:40.300
No heavy, bulky equipment.
No gimmicky gadgets.
Wow.

01:40.300 --> 01:44.237
No flimsy bands.
Used practically anywhere.

01:44.237 --> 01:47.774
We have developed
a whole ecosystem of products

01:47.774 --> 01:51.545
that use the MAXPRO
for resistance.
Wow.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.647
Basically, with MAXPRO,

01:53.647 --> 01:56.850
workouts are only limited
by your imagination.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.920
But wait, this is "Shark Tank,"
and we have much more.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.855
I mentioned that MAXPRO
is connected.

02:01.855 --> 02:06.193
Our onboard sensors
relay detailed workout analytics

02:06.193 --> 02:08.295
to our MAXPRO coaching app.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.098
At MAXPRO, we're not just
a single‐product company.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.799
Together with our customers,

02:12.799 --> 02:15.402
we're building
a global lifestyle brand,

02:15.402 --> 02:17.938
and for $500,000...
Whoo!

02:17.938 --> 02:20.574
...I'm offering 2.5%...

02:20.574 --> 02:22.009
‐Oh, Lord.
‐Oh, Lord!

02:22.009 --> 02:23.043
...of my company.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.946
Hey, Nezar,
did I hear you correctly

02:25.946 --> 02:27.514
when you were explaining it

02:27.514 --> 02:29.082
that you can adjust
the weight from ‐‐

02:29.082 --> 02:32.052
did you say 3 pounds to 300?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.987
Robert, why don't you
come and flex those muscles

02:33.987 --> 02:34.988
and check this out?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.356
I got to try it.
Please.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.591
But did I hear that
correctly?

02:37.591 --> 02:38.992
Yes, absolutely.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.728
Now, these are
10 feet cables.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.963
They're made of Dyneema,

02:42.963 --> 02:45.065
which is a high‐molecular
polyethylene.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.433
What weight do I have,
Nezar, now?

02:46.433 --> 02:47.668
That's just 5.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.569
Uh, 7. 7, 7.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.138
Good job, Robert.
That's 7.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.706
Let me
help you out here.
Alright.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.141
I just want to
show you how ‐‐

02:54.141 --> 02:55.542
I just wanted to feel ‐‐
Yeah, yeah.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.177
Like, I just wanted ‐‐

02:57.177 --> 02:58.445
This.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.080
There you go.
That's 10? That's 10?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.281
What is that, 50?

03:01.281 --> 03:03.784
That's 12.
That's level 12,

03:03.784 --> 03:05.986
which is about 45 pounds
right there.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.054
Oh, wow.
Oh, my God.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.722
I got to tell you,
that's incredible

03:08.722 --> 03:10.223
that you do it all
from that.
Yes.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.558
What I'd like to understand

03:11.558 --> 03:14.327
is when you talk about a company
that's worth $20 million ‐‐

03:14.327 --> 03:17.431
$500,000 for 2.5%,
$20 million valuation ‐‐

03:17.431 --> 03:18.899
I know and respect

03:18.899 --> 03:21.468
that you're gonna have sales
and lots of users.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.136
When did you start it,

03:23.136 --> 03:24.571
how much did you sell
when you started,

03:24.571 --> 03:26.740
and how have you been going
on the year‐over‐year basis?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.041
Sure.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.010
Overall product development
has been over 5 years,

03:30.010 --> 03:32.012
but we first started
shipping product

03:32.012 --> 03:33.513
in July of last year.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.215
Oh, really? Okay.
Just July.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.583
What did you do last year
in sales?

03:36.583 --> 03:37.484
$4 million in sales.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.219
‐Whoo!
‐Whoa. What?!

03:39.219 --> 03:40.287
Wow.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.089
What have you done
so far this year?

03:42.089 --> 03:43.790
Over $8 million.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.526
Wow.
Okay!

03:46.526 --> 03:48.595
But I don't like
resistance bands

03:48.595 --> 03:50.397
because I don't want to
have to go over the door

03:50.397 --> 03:52.432
and connect it to the door
and then close the door,

03:52.432 --> 03:54.034
and it's just, like,
a hassle.
Yes.

03:54.034 --> 03:57.037
But what if I want to do
other exercises?

03:57.037 --> 03:59.039
Thank you very much
for helping out.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.674
MAXPRO is literally
the most versatile thing

04:00.674 --> 04:01.708
you've ever seen.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.710
You can use it on a door.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.479
You can use it
like he's doing right there.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.314
It's in your kit right there.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.382
But you have to mount those
on your door.
Okay, so you put up
the clips.

04:09.382 --> 04:10.417
Yeah, and it's a strap.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.185
It's a single strap
that goes around,

04:12.185 --> 04:13.553
and they're
specially engineered.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.988
We have a wall track

04:14.988 --> 04:16.957
which does all the flies
that you're talking about.
Oh.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.458
You see her working out
on a tree,

04:18.458 --> 04:19.760
working out on a fence.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.496
How did you come up with this,
and what is your background?

04:22.496 --> 04:25.098
My primary background
is automotive.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.733
25 years in automotive.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.402
So for me, global
product management...
Are you an engineer?

04:29.402 --> 04:31.004
...supply chain ‐‐
Are you an engineer?

04:31.004 --> 04:32.405
Yes, I am an engineer.
Yes.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.807
Mechanical?
Yes.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.575
I was traveling at lot.
I was overseas.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.043
I kept missing workouts,

04:37.043 --> 04:38.545
and it was
just trying to figure out

04:38.545 --> 04:41.281
how to get that resistance
on the road.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.316
What does it cost to make it?
What does it cost to sell it?

04:43.316 --> 04:45.352
And then I believe
you have an app.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.187
So, retail value is $849.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.089
Whoa, $849?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.091
$849, and I got to preface ‐‐
Wow.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.626
Yes.
Are these ours to keep?

04:52.626 --> 04:53.960
Yes.
Thank you.

04:55.428 --> 04:59.566
So $849. And what does it
cost you to make it?

04:59.566 --> 05:00.867
$205 landed cost,

05:00.867 --> 05:04.337
$20 total between pick and pack
and shipping.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.606
And you sell
direct to consumer only?

05:06.606 --> 05:09.976
Yeah.
97% of our sales is D2C.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.244
Well, that's pretty well
everything.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.314
Nezar, how are you selling
$8 million of this?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.882
COVID. Everybody sold.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.384
Yes,
that's exactly right.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.986
And we do a ton of money
on marketing.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.488
So what are you burning
per month?

05:21.488 --> 05:23.757
Our essential burn's
about $100,000 per month.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.925
Oh!

05:24.925 --> 05:26.526
Could you become profitable

05:26.526 --> 05:27.761
if you slowed down
your marketing?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.229
We make money
on every one of these.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.331
No, are you cash flow
positive this year?
$1.6 million?

05:31.331 --> 05:33.600
The cash flow positive
is a yes and a no,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.001
because we take all the money ‐‐
No, it isn't.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.070
It's one or the other.
No, no. I mean, yes, we are.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.072
But then we take
that money ‐‐
No, look,
we get it.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.007
Yeah. Yeah.
Look, I understand
the business, right?

05:41.007 --> 05:43.410
This is a grind‐it‐out,
competitive business.

05:43.410 --> 05:48.381
We have over 3,000 daily users
right now on our app.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.850
Last year, you did $4 million

05:49.850 --> 05:51.484
from July to December.
Yes.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.920
How much did you make
on that $4 million?

05:53.920 --> 05:55.622
Just over $50,000.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.157
What was your net?
And this year,

05:57.157 --> 05:58.892
you're going to sell
$8 million.
Right.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.393
Are you going to make money
or lose money?

06:00.393 --> 06:02.996
No, this year,
we're probably going to reach

06:02.996 --> 06:04.731
over $12 million in sales.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.534
And what will you make on that?
Or will you lose money?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.302
We'll probably be close to
breaking even ‐‐

06:09.302 --> 06:10.704
But right now,
you're burning money,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.005
is what you're saying.
Yeah.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.106
Look, there's
nothing wrong with it, right?

06:13.106 --> 06:14.207
No, no, I'm okay with that.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.542
I know we get all caught up
in profits,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.711
but if you're going to scale
a business, right,

06:17.711 --> 06:18.912
you've got to invest
to grow.

06:18.912 --> 06:19.980
You know, Mark,
you're right.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.982
You need to fund
the growth. Okay?

06:21.982 --> 06:25.886
We took a revenue‐based
line of credit.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.520
And ‐‐
Ooh.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.489
So someone lent you money,

06:29.489 --> 06:31.791
and for every dollar
that you bring in,

06:31.791 --> 06:35.195
you have to pay what out?

06:35.195 --> 06:36.263
It was 20%

06:36.263 --> 06:38.498
and then goes to 25% now, 28%.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.933
Wow.
Basically,

06:39.933 --> 06:42.302
we have over $5 million
in inventory.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.870
In inventory. Okay.
Right now.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.506
$5 million?
And I'm curious,
why do you have that much?

06:46.506 --> 06:49.009
Were you required
to do certain quantities?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.077
It was a bit of a judgment call.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.545
We also signed on

06:52.545 --> 06:56.950
with a very big
endorsement personality ‐‐ Shaq.

06:56.950 --> 07:00.553
I met Shaq at CES
in January 2020.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.489
He came by our booth.
He checked it out.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.890
He goes, "Oh, you know what?

07:03.890 --> 07:05.325
I'm going to do this for you.
I'm going to blow you up."

07:05.325 --> 07:07.460
What was your deal with Shaq?
You gave him equity?

07:07.460 --> 07:09.062
He earns it over 4 years.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.330
But what does he earn?
How much?

07:10.330 --> 07:12.699
1.25% this year, okay,

07:12.699 --> 07:14.100
and it can go up to 5%.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.636
You're in a really tough spot
right now, then.

07:16.636 --> 07:17.938
Yeah,
we're in a tough spot,

07:17.938 --> 07:19.673
but we're also going into
the holiday season.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.875
Right, I get that, but you
don't have the money to spend

07:21.875 --> 07:23.176
on advertising.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.711
You need to blow this out.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.413
I need Sharks.
You need money.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.281
Yeah, yeah, it's hard,
but it's also expertise.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.482
I think I have an offer
for you.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.897
All Sharks are still in,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.265
and Daymond seems interested

07:45.265 --> 07:48.735
in Nezar's portable
fitness equipment, MAXPRO.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.304
I think I have an offer
for you.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.275
- I will give you the 500
- K,

07:55.275 --> 07:59.079
but I would put
a royalty on it.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.914
Did I hear royalty?
You did hear royalty.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.282
You don't say.
I do say.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.450
Well, I'm listening.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.388
$25 a unit
-'til I get back my 500
- K,

08:08.388 --> 08:13.293
and then I would convert to
4% ownership.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.195
That's not horrible.
It's not bad.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.330
That's a good offer.
Can I ask you a question?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.898
Yes, sure.
What do you need
from a Shark?

08:18.898 --> 08:21.501
I think the Sharks know
how to open doors.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.037
They can help us
to get more investments. Okay?

08:24.037 --> 08:28.842
And we're going into retail,
also hotels and military.

08:28.842 --> 08:32.712
We have so many military members
that take this on deployment.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.448
Nezar, you ever offer anybody
a half a million dollars

08:35.448 --> 08:37.550
and they didn't even
acknowledge it

08:37.550 --> 08:38.785
or give you
any kind of answer

08:38.785 --> 08:40.120
or any kind of feedback?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.788
I was thinking about you
the whole time,

08:41.788 --> 08:44.457
and questions are coming,
and I so apologize about that.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.792
So what do you think?

08:45.792 --> 08:47.627
I think
it's a pretty good deal.

08:47.627 --> 08:48.895
So?
I think
it's a pretty good deal.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.964
Not the royalties piece
and paying you back.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.932
What is your return rate?
I'm just curious.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.267
Oh, great question.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.069
And I'm happy to say
that it's less than 5%.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.304
I had an even better
question.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.906
Yeah, I mean,
but this is important

08:59.906 --> 09:01.174
because a less than 5%
in consumer goods ‐‐

09:01.174 --> 09:03.410
‐Yeah, it's very low.
‐That's really good, yeah.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.212
But you're overselling
at this point, right?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.281
No, he's not, 'cause some of us
still have questions.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.382
Okay, but what happens,
though ‐‐

09:09.382 --> 09:10.683
Because it's complicated.

09:10.683 --> 09:11.785
I would definitely
like to answer the questions.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.019
You see how long
your pitch is?

09:13.019 --> 09:16.856
I was sitting for 20 minutes
asking for an answer!

09:16.856 --> 09:20.193
Do you need the app,
and do you need all the rest?

09:20.193 --> 09:22.095
I mean, today,
everything has an app

09:22.095 --> 09:23.930
that even just has
your coached classes,

09:23.930 --> 09:26.366
but we've been working
from the ground up on a new app.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.301
You're losing a ton of money
right now.
Yeah.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.170
How much money
could it come down

09:30.170 --> 09:31.805
if you didn't have the app?

09:31.805 --> 09:34.741
This isn't just a connection
and count your reps.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.378
This is literally displaying
how you're working out.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.046
I'm going to push back
on that a little bit

09:40.046 --> 09:42.615
because I don't like where
you're going on the app spend.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.484
I look at this
and say to myself,

09:44.484 --> 09:45.819
"Why spend any money
on an app

09:45.819 --> 09:47.554
when everybody's
already got one?"

09:47.554 --> 09:50.657
So that's kind of
the tipping point for me.

09:50.657 --> 09:51.891
But they can't use the MAXPRO.

09:51.891 --> 09:53.960
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.663
We have a philosophical
disagreement on the direction.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.965
That's my opinion, okay?
I'm out.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.600
Okay, so ‐‐
"Oh, my God, Daymond,

10:00.600 --> 10:01.734
did you become more valuable?"
Let me see if I can get to
an offer.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.536
Why, yes, I did.
I did become more valuable.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.571
Let me see if I can get to
an offer.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.805
You're awesome,
Daymond.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.040
Let me see if I can get to
an offer,

10:07.040 --> 10:08.575
and you can tell me
if it works or not.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.076
So here's what I'll offer.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.012
- I'll give you the 500
- K
for 3%,

10:13.012 --> 10:16.783
plus I want the exact same deal
that you gave Shaq

10:16.783 --> 10:18.351
in advisory shares.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.254
So then that way, Shaq and I
can work together, do stuff.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.323
He's a great friend.
So that's what it is.
Oh.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.926
- 500
- K, 3%,
plus the 5% in advisory shares,

10:26.926 --> 10:28.394
vested the same way
as Shaq.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.598
That offer is far more generous
than I was going to make you.

10:31.598 --> 10:32.599
I'm out.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.200
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.668
"Oh, my God, did you become
even more valuable?"
So you got two offers.

10:35.668 --> 10:36.903
Thank you.
Are we good?

10:36.903 --> 10:37.971
Did he even
talk to you again?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.272
Did I answer
all the questions?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.508
No more questions.
You got to decide.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.309
Ah, Nezar.

10:43.309 --> 10:47.680
I think what Mark offered you
is a really good offer.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.817
I was going to be
a bit steeper than that.

10:50.817 --> 10:51.851
So...
Thank you.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.086
I'm going to go out.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.054
I'm so happy to be here
with all of you guys.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.523
You have two offers.
What are you going to do?

10:56.523 --> 10:57.624
And I never wait,
so this is ‐‐

10:57.624 --> 10:59.692
"Daymond, will somebody
talk to you?"

10:59.692 --> 11:02.929
Daymond, I definitely appreciate
the offer,

11:02.929 --> 11:05.398
but I just have
one question for Mark.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.400
Well, you got to make sure
that question is a good question

11:07.400 --> 11:08.902
because I'm out.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.237
Whoa.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.906
Yes, sir. Thank you.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.874
So the line of credit
that we have ‐‐

11:14.874 --> 11:16.476
is there a way
that we can replace that,

11:16.476 --> 11:18.244
or you can help with inventory?
Yeah, potentially.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.712
I'm not going to
commit to it now,

11:19.712 --> 11:20.914
but it's certainly on the table,

11:20.914 --> 11:22.682
and it's something I do
all the time.
Okay.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.250
The only offer you have
is Mark.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.052
Right, so we're having
a conversation.
No, no, I'm not arguing.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.321
I'm just saying yeah,
absolutely, Mark, dude,

11:28.321 --> 11:29.722
I'm, like, all‐in, baby.
Of course.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.059
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you so much.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.127
All right. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.095
Yeah, awesome.
Congrats, Nezar.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.230
Thank you so much.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.498
Daymond,
love you, man.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.666
We're not talking.
No, no, no, I ‐‐

11:42.035 --> 11:43.069
Whoo.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.408
Mark is a ‐‐ like, a perfect
fit for our company.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.143
This is a big game‐changer
for us.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.644
We're going to go
from a little company

11:51.644 --> 11:53.479
with no name recognition

11:53.479 --> 11:55.315
to basically a global brand.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.417
That is exactly
where we want to be.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.855
In season 12,
Duane Cheers,

12:02.855 --> 12:04.824
Danita Claytor,
and Jumoke Jackson

12:04.824 --> 12:06.326
made a deal with Mark Cuban

12:06.326 --> 12:08.494
for their gourmet
plant‐based food company,

12:08.494 --> 12:09.796
Everything Legendary.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.764
I think people are going
to love these. We got a deal.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.533
That's what I'm talking about!
We did it!

12:13.533 --> 12:15.268
Let's see
what they're up to now.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.037
When we pitched our
business to the great whites,

12:18.037 --> 12:20.506
all we had was $165,000
worth of sales.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.641
Right after "Shark Tank,"

12:21.641 --> 12:24.210
we did $250,000
in just 24 hours.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.178
Four months since then,

12:25.178 --> 12:27.847
we did $1.7 million
in sales.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.249
I cry about it
every single night.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.150
I do too.
It's unreal.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.519
Before "Shark Tank,"
we were in a shared kitchen,

12:33.519 --> 12:34.721
and when I mean
a shared kitchen,

12:34.721 --> 12:36.222
it was me and my mama's
kitchen,

12:36.222 --> 12:39.425
and we were doing over
1,000 burgers a day by hand.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.894
Now we've brought on
three co‐packers,

12:41.894 --> 12:43.596
two national
distribution centers,

12:43.596 --> 12:47.166
and we can produce over
160,000 burgers in just an hour.

12:47.166 --> 12:50.570
Let me just say how much respect
I have for the hustle.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.006
Everything Legendary
is a textbook case

12:53.006 --> 12:55.742
on what every entrepreneur
for consumer products should do.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.443
They go out to their customers.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.045
They don't take "no"
for an answer.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.413
They do pop‐up stores.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.115
Their energy
and their relentlessness ‐‐

13:02.115 --> 13:03.783
I mean, they're just
at the beginning

13:03.783 --> 13:05.151
of what they can be.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.620
In just a few months,
we have expanded our business

13:07.620 --> 13:09.789
to over 1,000
grocery store locations ‐‐

13:09.789 --> 13:13.259
Giant, Safeway, Target,
Walmart, and many more.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.597
An entrepreneur's journey
is a tough road.

13:17.597 --> 13:18.631
It's emotional.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.133
If you haven't cried
about your dreams,

13:20.133 --> 13:21.401
then your dreams
aren't big enough.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.936
You're going to receive
a million and one nos,

13:23.936 --> 13:25.271
but you have to
keep on going,

13:25.271 --> 13:26.906
because all you need
is that one yes,

13:26.906 --> 13:29.075
and that one yes will change
your entire life.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.943
Hey, we flying
off the shelf.

13:30.943 --> 13:33.479
I literally went from
being broke, living in my car,

13:33.479 --> 13:35.081
to now with a company
that did

13:35.081 --> 13:37.250
over $1.7 million in sales
in just 4 months.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.651
That's a dream come true.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.020
"Shark Tank" validated
every thought that we ever had

13:41.020 --> 13:43.656
and told us that if we stay
focused, if we work hard,

13:43.656 --> 13:46.059
we will be successful,
and most importantly,

13:46.059 --> 13:47.226
we will be legendary.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.707
Next up is a tool

14:00.707 --> 14:03.676
that takes snacking
to the next level.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.583
Oh, my goodness.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.556
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Renee Heath.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.524
And I'm Bechara Jaoudeh,
and we are...

14:18.524 --> 14:19.692
Banana Loca!

14:19.692 --> 14:21.060
Whoo!

14:21.060 --> 14:24.197
We're seeking $250,000

14:24.197 --> 14:26.432
in exchange for 25%

14:26.432 --> 14:29.202
of our very "ap‐peel‐ing"
business.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.772
Sharks, my favorite snack
of all time

14:32.772 --> 14:35.341
is banana
and chocolate hazelnut spread.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.476
Yes.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.311
The flavor combination
is just delicious.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.612
But what a mess.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.382
Have you ever tried to take
slippery banana slices

14:42.382 --> 14:44.050
and tried to spread
peanut butter on them?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.284
Awful.
It just doesn't work.

14:45.284 --> 14:49.322
So we are here to put an end
to this monkey business.

14:49.322 --> 14:54.293
Introducing Banana Loca,
the very first kitchen gadget

14:54.293 --> 14:56.763
that allows you to core
and stuff a banana

14:56.763 --> 14:58.231
while still in its peel.

14:58.231 --> 15:03.369
First, you core
while still in its peel

15:03.369 --> 15:07.273
and then fill it
with whatever you want.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.108
It's so easy to use

15:09.108 --> 15:14.313
that the whole family
can really use and enjoy.

15:14.313 --> 15:15.748
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.016
That is a great idea.
Interesting.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.484
That actually is not bad
at all.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.654
Sharks, creating joy by putting
something yummy in tummies

15:21.654 --> 15:23.856
and smiles on faces
is why we do this.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.058
So, Sharks, which one of you

15:26.058 --> 15:28.961
wants to join
our bonkers banana bunch?

15:28.961 --> 15:30.830
Open your <i>boca ♪</i>

15:30.830 --> 15:32.932
♪ Banana Loca, whoo! ♪

15:32.932 --> 15:34.834
Open your <i>boca ♪</i>

15:34.834 --> 15:36.936
♪ Banana Loca ♪

15:36.936 --> 15:38.571
Open your <i>boca ♪</i>

15:38.571 --> 15:40.740
♪ Banana Loca ♪

15:40.740 --> 15:41.774
Whoo!

15:41.774 --> 15:43.009
Sharks, in front of you

15:43.009 --> 15:45.144
is your very own
Banana Loca to try.

15:45.144 --> 15:46.379
How does it work?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.980
Renee's going to walk you
through it step by step.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.081
Please.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.717
So first, you're going to
take the banana

15:51.717 --> 15:54.720
and put the cut end
into the straightener.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.155
Ah, okay.

15:56.155 --> 15:59.025
Go ahead and straighten against
that holder with one hand.

15:59.025 --> 16:02.261
You're going to take your corer,
and when you insert it,

16:02.261 --> 16:04.263
wait 'til it's fully inside,

16:04.263 --> 16:07.099
and then give it a little twist
to break off that core.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.201
Oh, twist?
A little twist.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.603
Let me just tell you,
that is oddly satisfying.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.072
Good. We're glad
you're enjoying it.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.007
I'm not being funny.
I keep pulling it out,

16:15.007 --> 16:16.676
but it's not ‐‐
it's ‐‐ nothing's in it.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.177
So when you go
all the way in,

16:18.177 --> 16:19.479
you want to twist...
I did twist.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.147
...and then cover
the hole.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.715
That creates suction.
So what you have to do
in the next step...

16:22.715 --> 16:24.650
...is after you twist to
break off that core...
Oh! Cover this hole?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.886
...you're going to take
your thumb to cover that hole.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.521
Oh!

16:29.755 --> 16:31.290
That's the secret.
Yeah!

16:31.290 --> 16:33.860
That's the secret.
Got it.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.028
You should have
a perfectly cored banana.
Got it.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.064
You just have to take
your cored banana

16:38.064 --> 16:41.000
and go ahead
and insert it into the nozzle.
Oh, that's gross.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.469
So you go ahead
and insert the banana.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.271
I've become a pro
at this already.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.406
Just like a new utensil,
there's a learning curve.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.876
This is good.
Well, it tastes great.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.612
Y Chihuahua, caramba!
That's good.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.647
That is good.
I love this.
You do?

16:54.647 --> 16:56.349
This is
my favorite snack.
Yeah.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.318
This is genius.
Thank you, Robert.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.554
So, what else
can you do with it?

17:01.554 --> 17:04.190
You can fill doughnuts,
churros.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.291
Donuts?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.026
Zucchinis. Zucchinis.
Hot dogs. Zucchinis.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.327
Actually,
another vegetable

17:08.327 --> 17:10.963
was cucumbers
filled with cottage cheese.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.465
Ohh.
But also a big segment

17:12.465 --> 17:14.400
was cake
and cupcake decorating.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.036
All your sales are, obviously,
all online right?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.204
Correct. All D2C.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.972
Great.
And what are the sales?

17:19.972 --> 17:23.843
We have done $134,000
in sales in 5 months.
Wow.

17:23.843 --> 17:24.844
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.178
With limited marketing.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.147
Really, we've just rode
the organic wave

17:28.147 --> 17:29.448
from different influencers.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.517
And you didn't tell us
what the cost was landed.

17:31.517 --> 17:32.919
You're making this in China,
I assume?

17:32.919 --> 17:35.154
Correct.
Our landed cost is $6.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.689
$6? Okay.
And what do you
sell it for?

17:36.689 --> 17:38.291
$26.99.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.759
And how much do you have
invested in it,

17:39.759 --> 17:41.727
'cause I know you had to create
a mold and everything else.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.029
8 molds. Yeah.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.198
So we have about $224,000
of our own money in it.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.533
‐Oh.
‐Wow.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.236
That was a big
learning thing for us.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.138
I'm shocked, actually, at
the price, I have to be honest.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.439
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah, that's crazy.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.107
Yeah, you got a banana
in the tailpipe on that one.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.378
So I give you $250,000.

17:59.378 --> 18:00.179
‐Sure.
‐Mm‐hmm.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.480
What happens next?
Sure.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.684
The money will go towards
inventory and paid marketing

18:04.684 --> 18:08.120
so we can really supercharge
and put gasoline into our ‐‐

18:08.120 --> 18:09.255
You guys should never
have to do

18:09.255 --> 18:11.190
any paid marketing at all
on this thing.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.692
You're not going to take this
to retail, are you?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.061
Correct.
It's a very visual
demonstration.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.063
Sure.
It needs to be
demonstrated online,

18:17.063 --> 18:18.164
it needs to go viral,

18:18.164 --> 18:19.732
and people have to buy it
from your site.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.835
I like it, but the only way
this works for me,

18:22.835 --> 18:24.203
and I'll be the first
to tell you,

18:24.203 --> 18:25.471
is this is a royalty deal.

18:25.471 --> 18:26.672
That's what it is.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.942
I'll give you
the $250,000,

18:29.942 --> 18:31.677
and your margins are good enough

18:31.677 --> 18:34.046
to pay me back
3 bucks a unit.

18:34.046 --> 18:37.183
That's how I get my money back.
No equity. You own it.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.452
My interests are aligned
in using my social media

18:39.452 --> 18:40.620
to blow it up and say,

18:40.620 --> 18:43.022
"Look, this is
a Chef Wonderful exclusive."

18:43.022 --> 18:44.924
I'll sell a ton of these
for you.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.159
3 bucks a unit?
Yeah, 3 bucks a unit.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.295
You are being greedy.
I don't think so.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.730
Kevin, when does
the royalty stop?

18:50.730 --> 18:51.731
Never.
It doesn't.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.965
Never.
Never?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.533
Well, how do I make money,
Robert?

18:54.533 --> 18:55.401
How do I make money?

18:55.401 --> 18:56.369
How do they make money

18:56.369 --> 18:57.937
if they're always paying
a royalty?

18:57.937 --> 18:59.138
They get the rest.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.906
I mean, look, it's an offer.
You can decide.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.342
Yeah.
Thank you for the offer.

19:03.342 --> 19:06.479
I buy this type of stuff
every day

19:06.479 --> 19:08.881
and my wife takes it,
as soon as I open it up,

19:08.881 --> 19:11.384
she goes out to the backyard,
and she puts it in the garbage.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.722
And I do like it a lot,
but this is one of those things

19:16.722 --> 19:18.224
you'll do with the kids
once or twice,

19:18.224 --> 19:20.593
and then it's going to sit up
there with all the Tupperware.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.095
It's not going to work for me.
I'm out.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.664
Thank you, Daymond.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.133
You're so early,
and it's just not a business

19:27.133 --> 19:30.269
that I think is investable
for me right now.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.537
So I'm sorry, I'm out.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.106
Thank you, Laurie.
Thank you.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.009
I love gadgets.
I buy these things all the time.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.812
Look, complete flyer.
I love you guys.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.013
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.582
I really think
you're really entrepreneurial.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.218
I actually don't know
if it's going to go anywhere,

19:46.218 --> 19:48.554
so it has to be
a royalty deal for me.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.457
I'll give you the $250,000
you're looking for,

19:51.457 --> 19:56.929
$3 royalty until I recoup
$350,000.

19:56.929 --> 20:00.900
I also want 10% equity

20:00.900 --> 20:03.703
in case somebody
buys the product,

20:03.703 --> 20:05.771
or some other blow‐up.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.107
Thank you very much for your
offer and believing in us.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.542
Yeah.
Really appreciate it.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.644
What have you done
in social media?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.979
We have limited funds right now,
and that's where we're hoping ‐‐

20:13.979 --> 20:15.781
I'm not talking
about advertising. Right?
Yeah.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.950
So you should never have
to spend ‐‐
Oh, we're on Instagram,
we're on TikTok,

20:17.950 --> 20:19.318
we're on Twitter.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.820
But you have not
been able to get

20:20.820 --> 20:22.421
any traction yourselves
effectively.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.156
We do.
Nothing monumental.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.325
We need to get
a larger audience.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.327
We started from zero
under this brand.

20:28.327 --> 20:31.964
Yeah, 'cause I've done
two food videos with my son.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.532
The last one
had 20 million views,

20:33.532 --> 20:35.134
and the one before that
had 11, and so I'm ‐‐

20:35.134 --> 20:37.403
All right, Mark,
I'll give <i>you</i> $250,000 for 25%.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.872
But that's Mark Cuban's son,
right?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.540
No, I get it.
I get it, right?
I'm not there.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.075
I'm not trying
to compare the two, right?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.211
We're here
not just for the money.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.079
We need the star power
behind it.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.814
Giving us a little bit
of an edge

20:48.814 --> 20:50.616
and a little bit
of an endorsement

20:50.616 --> 20:52.451
is more important to us
than the money because ‐‐

20:52.451 --> 20:53.719
I don't know
if you need star power.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.021
I think you need ‐‐
Yeah, definitely do.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.790
You need functionality, guys.
You definitely do, because
that's what makes it go viral.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.959
You need it to do
a whole bunch of things...
Kevin, let's do this together,

20:59.959 --> 21:01.393
but do it as a regular deal,
not a royalty.
...and someone will go,
"You know what?

21:01.393 --> 21:03.496
It's worth
spending money on."
Got to be a royalty.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.864
No.
I'm not doing it
without a royalty.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.298
You never get your capital back.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.367
You'd be buying more and more
and more inventory forever.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.402
Bechara, you really think
you need star power

21:10.402 --> 21:11.403
to drive this thing?

21:11.403 --> 21:13.072
It's not
a silver bullet, right?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.841
It's going to be
healthy execution on our side,

21:15.841 --> 21:17.743
driving costs down,

21:17.743 --> 21:19.378
getting some funds
for inventory

21:19.378 --> 21:21.080
and some marketing
and promotions.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.048
Why take any equity?
Just do it ‐‐

21:23.048 --> 21:24.250
Because I want it.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.851
I think we can turn this
into an evergreen product.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.119
How much equity
do you want?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.988
We have
the execution machine in place.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.090
We just need
to pour more gasoline.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.225
Okay, guys, I'll help you pour
some gasoline.
Yeah.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.794
Kevin and I
want to work together,

21:34.794 --> 21:38.631
so we'll give you
the $250,000 for 25%,

21:38.631 --> 21:41.600
and we want a $3 royalty
but just until we're paid back.

21:41.600 --> 21:46.005
And so if we hit virally on
any of this, it's easy money.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.107
Very quick.
So that's the deal.
What do you think?

21:48.107 --> 21:51.443
Would you be open
to doing $2 royalty?
No.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.512
You got a deal.
Nice.

21:56.415 --> 21:57.716
Oh, congrats, guys.

21:57.716 --> 21:59.552
‐This is awesome.
‐Let's have some fun with it.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.654
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you so much.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.522
Open your <i>boca ♪</i>
Thank you. Thank you.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.658
♪ Banana Loca ♪
Oh!

22:05.658 --> 22:06.826
Open your <i>boca ♪</i>

22:06.826 --> 22:08.494
I've never hugged
a banana before.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.697
Guys, thank you so much
for your offers. Thank you.

22:11.697 --> 22:13.632
We freaking did it!

22:13.632 --> 22:16.435
He didn't want to choke
on his banana with that one.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.337
He said,
"Would you mind doing $2?"

22:18.337 --> 22:19.705
"No."
"No problem."

22:21.106 --> 22:23.142
Mr. Wonderful <i>and</i> Mark.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.710
We get two Sharks.
Two Sharks.
Wow.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.779
We got
our top two Sharks.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.014
They're going to bring
both their forces,

22:29.014 --> 22:31.650
big magnifying glass
on our brand.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.519
I mean, to the moon, baby.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.099
Next in the Tank

22:47.099 --> 22:50.102
is a business
with wellness in mind.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.546
Hi, Sharks.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.114
My name is Liv Bowser,

23:02.114 --> 23:04.283
and I'm from
Los Angeles, California.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.685
I'm seeking $200,000

23:06.685 --> 23:10.122
in exchange for 10%
of my company, Liberate.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.525
Sharks, are you ready for
the best workout of your life?

23:13.525 --> 23:15.761
Well, today, I'm going to
have you working out muscles

23:15.761 --> 23:17.563
you forgot existed.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.932
Just one second.
Let me get my equipment out.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.513
Perfect.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.415
Oh, did you think
we were working on

23:36.415 --> 23:38.484
our physical fitness today?

23:38.484 --> 23:41.887
No, Sharks. Today, we're
working out our mental muscles.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.088
Ah.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.258
Liberate is the first
mental fitness studio.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.260
Our method blends
mindful movement

23:48.260 --> 23:51.397
with journaling, conversation,
and meditation

23:51.397 --> 23:53.565
for a dynamic workout
for your mind.

23:53.565 --> 23:57.403
Our classes and courses
empower individuals and teams

23:57.403 --> 24:01.240
to build skills like courage,
gratitude, and resilience

24:01.240 --> 24:03.609
to strengthen
collective wellbeing.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.611
Sharks, it doesn't take
heavy lifting to know

24:05.611 --> 24:06.979
that we're onto something here.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.682
So who wants to put your money
where your mind is

24:09.682 --> 24:11.784
and join our mental fitness
movement?

24:12.651 --> 24:15.254
So, Liv, are you starting
a cult or something?

24:15.254 --> 24:17.623
No! Not in any way.
How the hell
do I make money

24:17.623 --> 24:19.124
with any of this crap?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.693
Do I go somewhere, Liv?

24:20.693 --> 24:22.061
Like a spin studio?
I mean, you have
a physical studio?

24:22.061 --> 24:24.964
We launched online classes
hosted over Zoom

24:24.964 --> 24:26.265
in May 2020.

24:26.265 --> 24:29.268
So, Liv, were these
instructor‐led classes?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.503
Yeah, so, it's myself
as a class leader,

24:31.503 --> 24:33.639
and we have four other
incredible class leaders

24:33.639 --> 24:36.575
with all the different
wellness backgrounds.
Right, but how many people
would log in?

24:36.575 --> 24:38.210
20, on average, per class.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.012
Okay,
and what do you charge?

24:40.012 --> 24:42.014
So a subscription
for our on‐demand library

24:42.014 --> 24:43.382
is $19 a month,

24:43.382 --> 24:45.718
and the subscription model
for all access,

24:45.718 --> 24:48.887
which includes our courses,
our live classes,

24:48.887 --> 24:51.190
and the on‐demand
is $49 a month.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.258
And how many subscribers
do you have?

24:53.258 --> 24:56.328
So, I want to open up
the picture a little bit

24:56.328 --> 24:58.630
because the main source
of our revenue

24:58.630 --> 25:00.599
- is our B2
- B model.

25:00.599 --> 25:03.202
In 2021, we realized

25:03.202 --> 25:04.937
businesses and teams
need a lot of help, too.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.372
Teams are really disconnected.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.573
They're remote,

25:07.573 --> 25:09.575
they're struggling to connect
on a human level.

25:09.575 --> 25:11.710
So 65% of our business now

25:11.710 --> 25:13.645
is through our corporate
partnerships.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.881
Let me ask,
what's your total sales?

25:15.881 --> 25:18.751
Total sales is
$50,000 lifetime.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.652
‐Ooh.
‐Ooh.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.087
That's not a lot, Liv.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.655
I don't think anybody here

25:23.655 --> 25:25.991
is going to challenge
your premise.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.794
I'm on board 100%.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.629
What I'm struggling with ‐‐

25:30.629 --> 25:33.532
how is this business
worth $2 million today?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.435
Yeah, our margins are over 90%.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.437
We have 178%

25:38.437 --> 25:40.105
quarter‐over‐quarter
growth rate.

25:40.105 --> 25:42.908
- We're 10
- X'ing the business
in the first year,

25:42.908 --> 25:45.544
and we've built
a highly scalable system,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.046
team, and curriculum.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.281
But you only have $50,000
in sales.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.549
Lifetime.
So far.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.017
We're just getting started.
How about this year?

25:52.017 --> 25:54.453
I love the optimism,
but, boy, is that ever small.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.521
How much did you do
last month?

25:55.521 --> 25:57.689
We did $7,500 last month,

25:57.689 --> 26:01.026
and we're projecting
doing $8,500 this month,

26:01.026 --> 26:03.228
and we have a $6,900 deal

26:03.228 --> 26:04.830
with a corporate partner
that's closing this month.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.732
You're not
getting scale, Liv.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.767
Yeah, that's the challenge.
Like, seriously.
Like, I love ‐‐

26:08.767 --> 26:11.537
I love everything about
what you're doing,

26:11.537 --> 26:14.907
but there are big companies
doing similar stuff,

26:14.907 --> 26:17.743
and they're charging us
$50,000 $100,000.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.279
Yeah, we don't charge that much.
So why aren't you
getting that scale?

26:20.279 --> 26:24.116
Is it because you don't
- understand the B2
- B market

26:24.116 --> 26:26.385
or the consumer market
isn't working for you?

26:26.385 --> 26:27.719
Why isn't there more?

26:27.719 --> 26:30.789
Our corporate program,
it's only 6 months old,

26:30.789 --> 26:31.957
and we also would like

26:31.957 --> 26:33.725
to use the capital
from a Shark investment

26:33.725 --> 26:35.127
to hire a sales manager

26:35.127 --> 26:37.396
to help really invest in scaling
- the B2
- B business.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.664
Yeah, that's still hard.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.365
I think his point, though,
is pricing

26:40.365 --> 26:41.800
more than anything else.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.135
I can raise the prices.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.436
Yeah,
and you might have to.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.306
I mean, look,
I believe in mental clarity.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.007
The Dallas Mavericks
have had

26:49.007 --> 26:52.244
a full‐time, you know,
team psychologist,

26:52.244 --> 26:54.346
because if you can't perform
mentally,

26:54.346 --> 26:55.714
you can't perform
physically.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.383
The challenge is, how do you
scale, to Robert's point?

26:58.383 --> 26:59.718
And I learned this
a long time ago ‐‐

26:59.718 --> 27:01.220
sell at a premium.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.355
Don't sell
out of desperation, right?

27:03.355 --> 27:05.390
Because selling
$5,000 deals

27:05.390 --> 27:10.362
is no easier than selling
$50,000 or $100,000 deals.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.364
Yeah.
You've got to get to
that point

27:12.364 --> 27:15.067
where you have enough confidence
because you're right on ‐‐

27:15.067 --> 27:17.436
you're on trend, you're on need,
you're on value,

27:17.436 --> 27:18.937
but you're under‐pricing
yourself,

27:18.937 --> 27:20.939
and because of that,
it's really impossible

27:20.939 --> 27:22.574
for an investor to come in

27:22.574 --> 27:25.577
because it's really impossible
to scale with where you're at.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.312
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.782
Well, I'd like to talk to
another point

27:30.782 --> 27:31.884
of how we can scale.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.752
Let me just ‐‐ Let me just
pick up on that

27:33.752 --> 27:34.953
because I think ‐‐

27:34.953 --> 27:36.588
Not if you're following
a similar trend, though.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.791
Well, you're very early
in your journey.

27:39.791 --> 27:40.659
You're ‐‐

27:40.659 --> 27:41.927
It's a good time to join.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.929
It is a good time
to join.

27:43.929 --> 27:47.299
It's not a good time to join
at a $2 million valuation.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.834
I love what you're doing,
but I ‐‐

27:48.834 --> 27:51.336
We are going to be
the SoulCycle of mindfulness.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.905
We're licensing out
our curriculum.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.240
We have 100 variations
of proprietary curriculum...
Maybe.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.376
...that can be licensed out
to every fitness studio,

27:57.376 --> 27:58.644
every fitness instructor.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.679
Maybe, but you haven't done
any of those things today

28:00.679 --> 28:03.015
to show me a tangible return.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.217
It's an early stage business,
but the idea ‐‐

28:05.217 --> 28:07.419
It's not
a $2 million business.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.221
It's not ‐‐
So what?
So I'm open‐minded.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.656
I'm so flexible.

28:10.656 --> 28:13.258
It is unbelievably important
to me to partner with a Shark.

28:13.258 --> 28:17.029
That is my goal.
I am so hardworking and driven.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.831
I‐I can't leave this carpet
without a deal.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.968
My purpose on Earth
is to build Liberate.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.537
I would love to have
your support on that journey.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.007
I just think you need to go
through a journey to learn more

28:29.007 --> 28:31.443
before I can come with you.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.611
I'm out.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.280
Okay. Thank you.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.616
Well, my thought is
that I love what you're doing.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.151
Thank you.
We all know

28:39.151 --> 28:42.020
that the mind is the largest
muscle on the body,

28:42.020 --> 28:44.656
and as soon as that thing
expands, it never shrinks.

28:44.656 --> 28:45.824
Never goes back.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.360
But you haven't
figured it out yet.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.394
Little too early.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.096
I love what you're doing,
but I'm out.

28:51.096 --> 28:53.732
Thank you.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.033
Kevin, Lori?
Liv.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.435
Lori?
Liv.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.469
Listen.
Lori.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.604
Listen.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.572
Lori! Lori!
Liv, listen.

29:03.008 --> 29:05.911
Come on.
Women supporting women.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.679
Mindfulness.
You meditate every day.
Liv. Liv.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.448
You have a wellness portfolio

29:09.448 --> 29:11.416
that's ripe and perfect
for Liberate.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.019
You're right, and, you know,
you've done your homework.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.687
You're wonderful.

29:15.687 --> 29:16.888
You have energy,
and you have grit.

29:16.888 --> 29:19.558
I'm open to literally any deal
on the planet.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.294
I really want to work with you.
I know. I know you are.
I know you are.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.796
Right now,
you are at a stage

29:24.796 --> 29:26.999
where you're figuring out
what you're doing.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.601
This is where you invest
in the entrepreneur

29:29.601 --> 29:32.104
and then the idea grows
like a tree.

29:32.104 --> 29:36.642
You don't have it realized
fully enough yet for me,

29:36.642 --> 29:39.077
and for that reason,
I'm out.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.414
Thank you, Lori.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.717
Royalties?

29:47.686 --> 29:49.254
Oh, wow.

29:49.254 --> 29:50.322
Liv.
Wow.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.924
Come on.
Good for you, Liv.
Good for you.

29:52.924 --> 29:56.295
This idea is without merit.
It's going to zero.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.529
You'll never make
any money.
No.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.931
Oh, God.
You will never get
an investor.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.100
Take it behind the barn
and shoot it

30:02.100 --> 30:03.468
and do something else.
No.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.937
You are
a disgusting human.
I'm out.

30:05.937 --> 30:07.439
Thank you, Kevin.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.341
Good luck, Liv.
Congratulations.
Good luck, Liv.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.842
You have to go now.
Do I leave?

30:10.842 --> 30:12.411
Yeah, that way.
Okay.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.246
Thank you!

30:16.415 --> 30:20.419
I went in believing in what
I was doing and my valuation,

30:20.419 --> 30:24.022
and I think I could have
valued it lower

30:24.022 --> 30:25.190
to get a Shark on board,

30:25.190 --> 30:26.491
but honestly,

30:26.491 --> 30:28.827
I think it's going to be
a billion‐dollar company,

30:28.827 --> 30:33.098
so I'm happy I stuck to my guns,
and no sense in regrets.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.745
Next in the Tank

30:46.745 --> 30:49.581
is a product inspired by
a creature from the sea.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.027
Ooh.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.796
Hello, Sharks,
my name is Hans Dose,

31:04.796 --> 31:06.298
I'm from Dana Point, California,

31:06.298 --> 31:08.166
and I'm here seeking $200,000

31:08.166 --> 31:11.503
in exchange for 10%
of my company, Tenikle.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.505
As you can see,
I love the ocean.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.107
I especially love the octopus.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.274
With all these tentacles,

31:16.274 --> 31:18.377
they could do
so many things at once.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.615
We humans have a big problem ‐‐

31:23.615 --> 31:25.951
holding phones while trying to
do something else

31:25.951 --> 31:27.552
with only two hands.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.954
You'll never see an octopus

31:28.954 --> 31:31.022
with not enough hands
to snap a selfie.

31:31.022 --> 31:33.925
Currently,
these options for humans...

31:33.925 --> 31:35.627
Oh, my.
Noooo!

31:35.627 --> 31:36.728
Hans!

31:36.728 --> 31:39.030
...only serve a single function.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.566
What if we had
one portable product

31:41.566 --> 31:43.335
that did everything these do?

31:43.335 --> 31:44.736
Now we do.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.405
Introducing Tenikle,

31:46.405 --> 31:49.274
the octopus‐inspired
suction mount for your tech

31:49.274 --> 31:52.577
designed to empower go‐getters
to do their thing better,

31:52.577 --> 31:53.845
totally hands‐free.

31:53.845 --> 31:56.047
Tenikle does a million things.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.884
It works with phones,
cameras, tablets.

31:58.884 --> 32:01.186
It's your car mount,
your bike mount,

32:01.186 --> 32:02.654
your speaker mount,

32:02.654 --> 32:07.793
and, hold your seahorses,
even...

32:07.793 --> 32:09.728
a pickle holder.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.631
What?
What?

32:12.631 --> 32:14.466
And just like the octopus,

32:14.466 --> 32:16.968
Tenikle is waterproof
and super durable.

32:16.968 --> 32:22.307
It can even support the weight
of a surfboard.

32:22.307 --> 32:23.742
Wow.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.877
Humans only have two hands.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.412
Let's fix that.

32:27.412 --> 32:29.080
So, Sharks, what do you say

32:29.080 --> 32:31.450
you jump in with a fellow
sea creature like me

32:31.450 --> 32:34.085
and make a huge splash
in the boring mount industry?

32:34.085 --> 32:36.922
I like it.
I really, really like it.
Thank you.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.056
How much do you sell it for,

32:38.056 --> 32:39.157
and how much
does it cost you to make?

32:39.157 --> 32:40.792
Sell it for $45.
Wow.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.661
Costs me $6.
$45? Wow.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.629
Yeah, we're selling it
at $45.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.131
We've tried
different price points,

32:46.131 --> 32:48.266
but it costs me $6.08
currently...

32:48.266 --> 32:49.534
‐Whoa!
‐...with that version.

32:49.534 --> 32:50.836
‐Nice!
‐Margin city!

32:50.836 --> 32:53.538
Wow. OK, but wait,
how many have you sold?

32:54.473 --> 32:56.141
Over 40,000 units to date.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.076
Dough!
40,000 units?!

32:58.076 --> 33:01.413
$1.3 million in sales to date.
Whoo!

33:01.413 --> 33:03.849
Coming out the gate hot.
And this is all this guy.

33:03.849 --> 33:06.051
When did you start?
How many years ago?

33:06.051 --> 33:10.555
So, I actually wrote
the patent myself in 2015.

33:10.555 --> 33:13.692
Wow.
I was working at Hurley
as a designer.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.828
It was really my dream job,
working in the surf industry,

33:16.828 --> 33:21.633
and I just had this idea,
what if I combined a car mount

33:21.633 --> 33:23.635
and a tripod into one?

33:23.635 --> 33:26.438
And when I gave the product
to friends and family,

33:26.438 --> 33:28.540
this crappy prototype
that I made,

33:28.540 --> 33:32.310
every person had this discovery
moment where they were like,

33:32.310 --> 33:34.112
"Oh, my God,
I can use it for this,"

33:34.112 --> 33:36.248
or "Hey,
I can use it for this."

33:36.248 --> 33:39.417
And there's so many use cases
for it that I was like,

33:39.417 --> 33:41.186
"Oh, I have to do this,
obviously."

33:41.186 --> 33:44.289
So at the end of 2017,
I launched a Kickstarter.

33:44.289 --> 33:47.425
We raised about $172,000.
It blew my mind.
Wow.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.694
And then I thought, "Oh, my God,
I have to quit my job.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.729
I have to do this."

33:50.729 --> 33:53.965
So when I do something,
I go 110%.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.634
I quit my dream job.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.637
The product that you see here,
generation 4.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.705
What was wrong
with version three?

34:00.705 --> 34:03.174
On Amazon, I saw that
there were some reviews

34:03.174 --> 34:06.978
that were not ‐‐
We had a 3.7‐star review,

34:06.978 --> 34:08.513
and I was like,

34:08.513 --> 34:10.515
"Okay, that's still not ‐‐"
I needed that 5.

34:10.515 --> 34:11.483
Why didn't
people like it?

34:11.483 --> 34:12.717
Honestly, the suction cups.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.352
That was the biggest thing.
Ah.

34:14.352 --> 34:17.022
Suction cup geometry
is a whole science.

34:17.022 --> 34:18.957
What did it cost to go through
all these iterations?

34:18.957 --> 34:22.093
Well, to be honest,

34:22.093 --> 34:24.496
my debt is at
$270,000 currently.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.464
Okay.
$270,000?!

34:26.464 --> 34:27.332
Yes. I know.

34:27.332 --> 34:29.334
Y Chihuahua, caramba!
Whoa.

34:29.334 --> 34:31.136
What is your
last year of sales?

34:31.136 --> 34:36.441
So, last year, we did
about $478,000 in sales.

34:36.441 --> 34:37.676
And what did you do
last month?

34:37.676 --> 34:38.843
What was your profit
on that?

34:38.843 --> 34:41.379
Last month, we did about
$9,000 in sales.

34:41.379 --> 34:42.614
Oh.
Not good.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.615
What happened?

34:43.615 --> 34:44.716
I want to tell you
what happened.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.586
So we were doing so well
in 2020.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.522
Despite COVID, so many people
were using this product

34:50.522 --> 34:52.791
for FaceTiming or Zoom calls,

34:52.791 --> 34:54.893
and the year prior,
I had run out of product.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.728
So this year, I freaked out,

34:56.728 --> 34:58.797
and I ordered
a shipping container full,

34:58.797 --> 35:00.599
so at cost, it was about 130K.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.267
And why didn't it sell?

35:02.267 --> 35:03.868
Thanksgiving Day comes,

35:03.868 --> 35:06.171
and I ran out of
marketing dollars

35:06.171 --> 35:07.405
to continue going.

35:07.405 --> 35:10.809
My only sales were coming
from one channel ‐‐

35:10.809 --> 35:14.079
that is our website
and paying Facebook ads.

35:14.079 --> 35:16.281
So how much inventory
do you have right now?

35:16.281 --> 35:18.483
About $891,000.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.051
Wow. At cost?
Whoa!

35:20.051 --> 35:22.554
At cost,
about $111,000 at cost.

35:22.554 --> 35:26.458
But you don't have to really pay
for ads, necessarily.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.693
You could do
your own videos.

35:28.693 --> 35:31.262
Put them up on
social media platforms.
I'm learning that.

35:31.262 --> 35:32.397
Is this your full‐time gig?

35:32.397 --> 35:33.698
This is my full‐time gig.

35:33.698 --> 35:36.301
My wife and I, we work together
on this business,

35:36.301 --> 35:38.236
and to get out
of our debt situation,

35:38.236 --> 35:39.704
we moved into an RV.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.006
I'm not kidding.

35:41.006 --> 35:44.609
An RV on my mom's property
in Menifee, California.

35:44.609 --> 35:47.278
All right, Hans.
So it's clear you're all in.

35:47.278 --> 35:48.413
You're all in.
Yes.

35:48.413 --> 35:51.216
If you don't get
more capital to buy ads...

35:51.216 --> 35:52.484
Yup.
...you're going to zero.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.718
No.

35:53.718 --> 35:54.953
That's what I think.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.756
No, 'cause you've got
$110,000 in inventory.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.859
Your worst case, you're going
to flea markets on weekends

36:00.859 --> 36:02.627
and demonstrating
and selling them there.
Worst case.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.462
How much cash
do you have, Hans?

36:04.462 --> 36:06.197
I have $39 in the bank.

36:06.197 --> 36:07.432
‐
‐Oh!

36:07.432 --> 36:08.833
‐What?
‐You have what? $39?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.769
How did you get here?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.404
I have just enough to get home.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.339
How are you going to get
back? Not with that.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.007
You're going to have to
sell your flippers.
I've got gas money.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.375
These would be worth
a lot, actually.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.643
Yeah, you're right.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.311
Well, Hans, let me look at it
this way.

36:20.311 --> 36:23.481
One saving aspect to this is
the product's pretty good.

36:23.481 --> 36:24.616
It's amazing.
It's really good.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.052
Fundamentally,
I can't criticize the product

36:27.052 --> 36:28.386
and I can't criticize you.

36:28.386 --> 36:29.587
You're a good guy.

36:29.587 --> 36:30.488
Thank you.
I get it.

36:30.488 --> 36:32.257
You need to get capital.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.225
I love you, dude.
It's not about ‐‐

36:34.225 --> 36:35.393
No, listen.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.828
That's a first also.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.764
In the end,
I don't need another job.

36:39.764 --> 36:42.434
It's not a situation
I want to put myself into.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.269
I wish you the best.
I'm out.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.337
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

36:46.337 --> 36:49.274
So, I think
it's a good product.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.910
I think you're in
a very crowded space.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.445
It's just not the right
investment

36:53.445 --> 36:54.779
for me at this time.
Okay.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.715
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.
Thank you.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.716
Thank you, Lori.

36:58.783 --> 37:00.785
I can make it happen.
I know I can.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.987
Yeah, I incurred some debt
along the way,

37:02.987 --> 37:05.290
but it's serviceable.

37:05.290 --> 37:08.460
My monthly payments
are about three grand a month.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.894
Three grand isn't a lot,

37:09.894 --> 37:12.664
but it is when you have
$39 in cash.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.998
You know,
so often on "Shark Tank,"

37:13.998 --> 37:17.836
we have to peel the onion
so deep to get the truth.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.904
And you just came out here
and bared your soul.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.773
I appreciate that.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.975
I think you need a reboot.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.144
So I'm going to
make you an offer.

37:26.144 --> 37:30.381
You owe, total debt,
$270,000, right?

37:30.381 --> 37:31.649
Mm‐hmm.

37:31.649 --> 37:35.587
I will give you
$270,000.

37:35.587 --> 37:39.257
We pay off the existing debt
to everyone.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.291
Okay.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.193
And basically,
that brings the company

37:42.193 --> 37:44.395
back to ground zero.
Yeah.

37:44.395 --> 37:48.333
I will then give you
an additional $100,000

37:48.333 --> 37:51.302
to seed the "new" company.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.771
Here's the catch, though.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.051
Two Sharks are out.

38:07.051 --> 38:09.721
Hans has big debts
and little cash in the bank,

38:09.721 --> 38:11.422
but Robert seems willing
to take a chance

38:11.422 --> 38:13.858
on his device accessory
company, Tenikle,

38:13.858 --> 38:15.627
but it might come at a cost.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.828
Here's the catch, though.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.700
I own 60, you own 40.

38:22.700 --> 38:23.701
‐Ooh!
‐Yowza!

38:23.701 --> 38:24.769
Here's the caveat, though.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.538
Whoa!
Here's the caveat.

38:26.538 --> 38:29.073
Whoo!
You're going to have to
bring in real partners

38:29.073 --> 38:30.275
who are going
to run the business.

38:30.275 --> 38:31.309
Bad idea.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.045
The next partner
we bring in

38:34.045 --> 38:37.916
is another Hans
who has the level experience,

38:37.916 --> 38:40.685
has the experience
in this area,

38:40.685 --> 38:43.688
and whatever equity
we need to give them,

38:43.688 --> 38:46.157
it will come
out of my 60%.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.326
Well, that's interesting.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.627
All right, Hans,
you know, let me tell you

38:49.627 --> 38:50.895
why I think my fellow Sharks

38:50.895 --> 38:52.697
are tucking and rolling
out of this deal ‐‐

38:52.697 --> 38:54.833
because of
your vulnerability

38:54.833 --> 38:56.601
to say you only have
$39, right?

38:56.601 --> 38:59.137
And a lot of people come on here
and they they act like

38:59.137 --> 39:00.572
everything's all great,
so I say,

39:00.572 --> 39:01.806
"Well, why are you here?"
Yeah.

39:01.806 --> 39:03.875
But on the flip side,
I get it.

39:03.875 --> 39:04.976
You know,
when I had turned

39:04.976 --> 39:06.244
my mother's house
into a factory,

39:06.244 --> 39:07.946
I took a $100,000 loan.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.247
It was the biggest

39:09.247 --> 39:11.316
and the largest amount of
pressure I ever had in my life.

39:11.316 --> 39:12.450
Three months later,
I turned around,

39:12.450 --> 39:14.018
and I only had
$500 in the bank.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.187
I was three months late
on the mortgage, right?

39:16.187 --> 39:18.857
I was paying for raw goods
90 days ahead of time.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.525
I was paying for
a staff and salaries,

39:20.525 --> 39:22.060
and my accounts receivables,

39:22.060 --> 39:24.596
they wouldn't pay me
for 30, 60, 90 days.
Yeah.

39:24.596 --> 39:25.997
And it was this moment
in my life

39:25.997 --> 39:27.765
when my mother came home
and said,

39:27.765 --> 39:29.968
"I'm‐a take an ad out
in the newspaper."

39:29.968 --> 39:32.237
I said, "That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard."

39:32.237 --> 39:33.872
She took out an ad ‐‐

39:33.872 --> 39:37.876
"Million dollars
in orders need financing."

39:37.876 --> 39:41.045
I got 33 offers
the next day.
Wow.

39:41.045 --> 39:44.148
30 of them were loan sharks
and people like Kevin O'Leary.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.517
You're lucky I was there
for you, Daymond.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.286
One was Samsung's
textile division

39:48.286 --> 39:49.954
and my mentors now,

39:49.954 --> 39:51.623
and they believed in me.
Yeah.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.992
I had nothing. Zero.
Yeah.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.461
I believe in you.

39:56.461 --> 39:58.429
But it's going to be
expensive.

39:59.964 --> 40:03.635
Because this is
such high risk.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.236
Yeah.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.573
But I'm going to offer you
$200,000 for 1/3.

40:08.573 --> 40:11.676
One third? 33%
33 1/3.

40:11.676 --> 40:15.113
Okay. 33%. And ‐‐

40:15.113 --> 40:16.781
No, 33 1/3.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.616
Let's make it
an even 30.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.719
I know you know my back's
up against the wall, but...

40:21.719 --> 40:23.087
That's not the purpose.
Well, at least
you're honest about it.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.122
That's not why.
I'm not trying to do it

40:24.122 --> 40:25.223
'cause your back's
up against the wall.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.391
but I'm putting money
at risk.

40:26.391 --> 40:29.127
Yeah, I understand.
Okay.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.095
And actually, that's not a bad
offer, all things considered.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.897
It's better than
I would have done. I'm out.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.666
Okay. Thank you, Mark.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.334
You have an offer
from Robert,

40:36.334 --> 40:38.403
and you have an offer
from Daymond.

40:38.403 --> 40:39.804
What do you think?
Daymond's offer's legit.

40:39.804 --> 40:41.039
Well, my offer is legit,
Mark.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.273
No, it isn't, Robert.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.810
Robert,
it is a legitimate offer,

40:45.810 --> 40:47.578
and I really appreciate
your offer.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.915
It would just break my heart
for how much I put into it,

40:50.915 --> 40:52.750
and for those reasons,
I'm out.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.121
Have you been always
wanting to say that?

40:57.121 --> 40:59.624
No!
I've been waiting
to say that forever!

40:59.624 --> 41:00.758
You had to get it on.

41:00.758 --> 41:02.894
I had to do it.
You had to get it on.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.764
Honestly, Daymond...

41:06.764 --> 41:08.199
I ‐‐ dude,

41:08.199 --> 41:09.767
this is a moment
right here, dude.

41:09.767 --> 41:10.735
We're good.
It is.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.103
Yeah, dude.
I like this.

41:12.103 --> 41:16.841
Daymond, what would you feel
about 25%

41:16.841 --> 41:19.777
- for the 200
- K?

41:19.777 --> 41:21.846
I feel 30
sounds really good.

41:21.846 --> 41:24.449
I know it sounds tasty,
but that 25% ‐‐

41:24.449 --> 41:26.117
He came down
from 33 1/3.

41:26.117 --> 41:29.520
Remember, I went to 33.
I went back to 30.
I know you did. Yeah.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.589
Dude, I think we could do
a killing together.

41:31.589 --> 41:35.259
I think you can open up a ton
of doors, and I can execute.

41:35.259 --> 41:36.260
I know I can execute.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.296
What's your best counter?

41:38.296 --> 41:41.232
25% is my best counteroffer.

41:41.232 --> 41:44.502
I‐I love it.
I think I will take it at 30.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.575
That's hard, man.

41:50.575 --> 41:51.576
Uh...

41:56.647 --> 41:57.648
Let's do it.

42:00.318 --> 42:01.919
I like to counter.
All right!

42:01.919 --> 42:03.021
I got to counter.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.689
I never hugged a guy
with flippers before, man.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.525
I am going to work.
Seriously.
You got it, brother.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.593
‐Great product.
‐Thank you, guys.

42:08.593 --> 42:09.827
‐Congratulations.
‐Seriously, thank you.

42:09.827 --> 42:11.229
Great product, Hans.
Thank you, guys.

42:11.229 --> 42:12.797
Congrats.
Seriously. Love you, guys.

42:12.797 --> 42:14.198
Thank you.
Love you, too.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.199
Bye.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.336
I had my back
up against the wall

42:18.336 --> 42:20.705
with $39 in the bank,
living in an RV.

42:20.705 --> 42:23.674
I made wrong moves before,
but all the right moves today.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.710
I'm so stoked.
