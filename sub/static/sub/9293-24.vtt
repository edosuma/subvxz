00:14.167 --> 00:15.267
I'm aware that your

00:15.334 --> 00:17.000
generals are pushing you

00:17.067 --> 00:19.034
toward a military response.

00:19.101 --> 00:21.334
SUVAROV:
 <i>Until you have the component,</i>

00:21.401 --> 00:25.134
I have no choice but to continue
on our present path.

00:25.201 --> 00:26.568
The man who has the component

00:26.633 --> 00:28.267
is no longer working
with the Chinese.

00:28.334 --> 00:30.834
He's offered to
trade it back to us,

00:30.900 --> 00:32.767
and I've authorized
the exchange.

00:32.834 --> 00:35.167
Phillip Bauer
is a sociopath.

00:35.234 --> 00:47.401
 <i>We can't trust that</i>
 <i>he'll give us that component</i>

00:47.468 --> 00:50.867
re probably on their way'
to arrest me.

00:50.934 --> 00:52.201
They're here.

00:52.267 --> 00:54.667
Send the kid down now.

00:54.733 --> 00:57.234
Show the sub-circuit board
first.

00:57.301 --> 00:58.867
 <i>I need to verify it.</i>

01:04.534 --> 01:06.267
There they are.
They've got Josh.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.767
 <i>I don't have a clear shot</i>
 <i>without putting</i>

01:10.834 --> 01:11.934
Josh at risk.

01:15.267 --> 01:16.367
Get down!

01:16.434 --> 01:17.867
I want you to get me

01:17.934 --> 01:20.267
the names and locations of every
offshore oil platform

01:20.334 --> 01:23.000
within a ten-mile radius.
My father

01:23.067 --> 01:24.733
didn't pick this location
at random.

01:28.267 --> 01:29.401
Morris, no luck

01:29.468 --> 01:31.401
tracing the oil leases
through the CNC server.

01:31.468 --> 01:32.834
You okay?

01:32.900 --> 01:34.767
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:36.201 --> 01:38.867
My God! Chloe! Chloe?

01:38.934 --> 01:41.667
Could someone
please help me?

01:41.733 --> 01:43.767
Darling? Darling?
Can you hear me?

01:43.834 --> 01:45.967
Can someone please help me?!

01:57.501 --> 01:59.700
(motor humming)

02:07.967 --> 02:09.501
(motor stops)

02:21.201 --> 02:22.800
Joshua.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.101
I don't want to be
here with you!

02:29.167 --> 02:31.468
We're not staying here.
We're leaving.

02:31.534 --> 02:33.633
I don't want
to go anywhere with you.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.101
Look, Josh,
I don't expect you to understand

02:36.167 --> 02:38.967
everything.
Not now, anyway.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.101
Someday, you will,
and you'll thank me for it.

02:43.101 --> 02:47.000
In the meantime,
you'll do as
you're told.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.468
Is that clear?

02:53.700 --> 02:56.034
Good.

02:56.101 --> 02:58.867
(Cheng speaking Chinese)

03:00.700 --> 03:02.334
The submarine is on schedule.

03:02.401 --> 03:03.834
How soon before
they pick us up?

03:03.900 --> 03:05.834
30 minutes.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.468
Her vitals are strong.

03:28.534 --> 03:30.767
She's in no immediate danger.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.633
Then why did she collapse?

03:33.700 --> 03:34.967
Dehydration. Exhaustion.

03:35.034 --> 03:36.934
She hasn't slept
in 36 hours.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.633
He said I'm fine, Morris.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.301
It's not a big deal.

03:44.367 --> 03:45.834
You should be
at your workstation.

03:45.900 --> 03:49.134
No. I should
be right here with you.

03:49.201 --> 03:50.468
You should
be checking

03:50.534 --> 03:52.800
the EPA database, to see what
oil platforms are owned

03:52.867 --> 03:54.900
by Phillip Bauer.
Other people can do that.

03:54.967 --> 03:56.900
If you really want
to make me feel better,

03:56.967 --> 03:59.234
then go find Phillip Bauer.

03:59.301 --> 04:01.800
Are you sure you're all right?

04:06.501 --> 04:08.700
Okay, then.

04:19.534 --> 04:21.267
(sighs)

04:31.700 --> 04:33.700
Morris, is Chloe all right?

04:33.767 --> 04:35.401
The doctor's still running
some tests, but he says

04:35.468 --> 04:36.667
she's going to be fine.

04:36.733 --> 04:38.568
Jack was right about his father.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.234
One of his companies
owns a federal lease

04:40.301 --> 04:42.568
on an oil platform
six miles offshore.
That's where you think

04:42.633 --> 04:44.134
Phillip Bauer's keeping the boy?

04:44.201 --> 04:45.568
Well, the platform's
been decommissioned.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.534
Okay. Give me
the wheel, Nadia.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.600
Let's try a thermal scan.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.034
See if we can pick up
any signs of life.

04:59.167 --> 05:02.934
That's awfully crowded
for a decommissioned platform.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.967
Can you back-time the satellite
imagery a few minutes?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Okay, there. That must be
Josh Bauer arriving.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.800
That would be 20 minutes
after he was taken.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.501
The timing works.
Send a copy of this

05:18.568 --> 05:20.667
to my screen, and forward
it to the White House.

05:20.733 --> 05:21.733
Will do.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.667
Get me Tom Lennox, please.

05:31.334 --> 05:34.934
(phone rings)

05:35.000 --> 05:36.434
Dr. Hastings here.

05:36.501 --> 05:37.934
This is Morris O'Brian.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.167
Have Chloe O'Brian's
test results come in yet?

05:40.234 --> 05:42.401
You just left here
a few minutes ago,
Mr. O'Brian.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.934
We're still
running those tests.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.501
Well, when do you
expect the results?

05:46.568 --> 05:47.900
Soon.

05:47.967 --> 05:49.700
Can you call me
when you get them?

05:49.767 --> 05:51.967
I'm afraid I can't
release that information.

05:52.034 --> 05:54.000
Not without
Ms. O'Brian's permission.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.401
I'm her husband.

05:55.468 --> 05:57.667
Ex-husband. I'm sorry,
but I can only share information

05:57.733 --> 06:00.401
with Ms. O'Brian's family.

06:00.468 --> 06:02.867
Fine.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.000
And reports indicate
the Russians
are setting up

06:08.067 --> 06:10.733
an offensive
position.
All right. Thank you.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.867
Meaning they can attack our base
at a moment's notice.

06:12.934 --> 06:14.633
That's correct, sir.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.000
Sir, that was CTU.
They've just located

06:16.067 --> 06:17.568
Phillip Bauer
and a dozen or so

06:17.633 --> 06:19.367
confederates
on an oil drilling platform

06:19.434 --> 06:20.967
six miles off the coast
of Los Angeles.

06:21.034 --> 06:22.501
And he has
the sub-circuit board?

06:22.568 --> 06:24.334
We are assuming so, sir.

06:24.401 --> 06:26.401
I'll pass this on to Suvarov.

06:26.468 --> 06:28.000
Maybe it'll buy us
some more time.

06:28.067 --> 06:30.733
Meanwhile, I want an assault
team dispatched

06:30.800 --> 06:32.534
to that oil rig.
Mr. Vice President,

06:32.600 --> 06:33.301
if I may?

06:33.367 --> 06:35.134
Go ahead, Ethan.

06:35.201 --> 06:37.000
If the platform
is well-defended,

06:37.067 --> 06:39.367
an assault team might
run into trouble.

06:39.434 --> 06:41.067
I recommend an air attack.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.700
Two Navy F-18's could

06:43.767 --> 06:45.401
obliterate that platform
and everyone on it.

06:45.468 --> 06:47.867
What about
the sub-circuit board?

06:47.934 --> 06:49.967
If it's not destroyed
in the attack,

06:50.034 --> 06:51.134
it'll sink into the ocean,

06:51.201 --> 06:52.867
the salt water will
render it useless

06:52.934 --> 06:55.234
in minutes.
Tom?

06:55.301 --> 06:58.000
Sir, we think
Phillip Bauer's grandson

06:58.067 --> 06:59.700
is on that same platform.

06:59.767 --> 07:04.568
Now, he might well
survive a surgical strike
by an assault team,

07:04.633 --> 07:06.267
but there's no way
he's going to live

07:06.334 --> 07:08.201
through this proposed
aerial attack.

07:08.267 --> 07:12.401
We are talking about an innocent
16-year-old boy here.

07:12.468 --> 07:14.067
None of us like
this any more

07:14.134 --> 07:16.101
than you do, but
if the Russians attack our base,

07:16.167 --> 07:18.067
a lot of innocent young men
are going to die.

07:19.867 --> 07:23.201
And the truth is,
an air strike

07:23.267 --> 07:24.468
would be the
most effective

07:24.534 --> 07:26.234
from a political point
of view, as well.

07:26.301 --> 07:28.700
It'll show the Russians
that we're

07:28.767 --> 07:30.900
sparing no effort
to destroy

07:30.967 --> 07:32.501
the sub-circuit board.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.201
Send the F-18's immediately.

07:36.267 --> 07:37.834
Yes, sir, Mr. Vice President.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.867
You're gonna be
all right, Mike.

07:41.934 --> 07:43.101
You're going
to make it.

07:43.167 --> 07:44.134
Jack, I'm sorry.

07:44.201 --> 07:45.733
You were following
your orders.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.067
(phone rings)
Get the kid...

07:47.134 --> 07:48.434
Get the kid,  Jack.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.700
I will.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.267
Did you find my father?

07:53.334 --> 07:54.900
Yes. We believe
that he's on a
decommissioned

07:54.967 --> 07:57.000
Tomol oil platform,
six miles offshore.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.201
Were you able to confirm
that Josh is with him?

07:59.267 --> 08:01.101
Thermal scan shows
three people arriving
on the platform

08:01.167 --> 08:02.900
20 minutes after
Josh was taken,

08:02.967 --> 08:04.633
so it's highly likely
he's one of them.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.301
Nadia, I want
to lead the assault team.

08:06.367 --> 08:09.000
There's not going
to be an assault team, Jack.

08:09.067 --> 08:10.434
What are you talking about?

08:10.501 --> 08:12.934
I just got notification that
the White House has ordered

08:13.000 --> 08:14.501
an air strike by Navy F-18s.

08:14.568 --> 08:17.000
The Vice President thinks an
assault team will take too long.

08:17.067 --> 08:19.067
I couldn't call those jets back
if I tried.

08:19.134 --> 08:20.267
When is it going to happen?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.000
In less than 30 minutes.
Look, I need

08:22.067 --> 08:23.633
you and Bill to come back to CTU

08:23.700 --> 08:25.334
on Aerial One
for an immediate debrief.

08:28.334 --> 08:29.600
Jack?

08:29.667 --> 08:31.167
Fine.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.101
What's wrong?

08:34.167 --> 08:35.799
CTU located my father and Josh

08:35.866 --> 08:37.900
on one of the offshore
oil platforms.

08:37.967 --> 08:39.534
There's not going
to be an assault.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.799
They've launched
an F-18 air strike.

08:40.866 --> 08:43.167
No one on that platform
is going to survive.

08:43.234 --> 08:45.934
I'm sorry, Jack.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.468
Jack, don't even
think about it.

08:47.534 --> 08:49.700
You'll only
get yourself killed.
You won't save Josh.

08:51.434 --> 08:53.501
Look, I realize
he's your nephew...

08:53.568 --> 08:55.867
I'm not going to do something
because he's my nephew.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.501
I'm going to do
something because
he's an innocent kid being

08:58.568 --> 09:00.733
written off as some kind of an
acceptable loss. It's wrong.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.367
Nadia has ordered
us back to CTU
in Chopper One.

09:04.434 --> 09:06.401
I'm going to take it.

09:06.468 --> 09:07.967
I'll fly.

09:08.034 --> 09:10.301
You prep the weapons.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.167
It's been a while, but I can
get us to the platform.

09:13.234 --> 09:16.034
With any luck,
I might even be able
to get us back.

09:16.101 --> 09:18.301
You don't need
to do this, Bill.
Yes, I do.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.934
I don't want to live
with this one either.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.934
Let's get ready.

09:30.067 --> 09:31.867
You're going to need that.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.900
We're commandeering
your helicopter. Get out.

10:34.867 --> 10:38.234
#Fixing target coordinates.
Be in range in 22 minutes.

10:42.334 --> 10:45.600
Sir, significant numbers
of Russian troops

10:45.667 --> 10:47.734
have assumed
a flanking position

10:47.800 --> 10:49.468
along the eastern rim
of our military base.

10:49.533 --> 10:50.967
What am I to
take from that?

10:51.034 --> 10:55.867
A tactical advancement like that
indicates imminent attack.

10:55.934 --> 10:59.301
All right.
Put him through. Sir?

10:59.368 --> 11:00.934
You got Suvarov?

11:01.001 --> 11:03.201
Yes, sir.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.468
Mr. President, this is

11:08.533 --> 11:09.633
Vice President Daniels.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.734
Mr. Vice President,
the last time we spoke,

11:12.800 --> 11:15.567
you said an opportunity
had presented itself.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.001
Unfortunately, that
didn't work out,

11:18.067 --> 11:19.001
but there has been

11:19.067 --> 11:20.667
a significant
new development,

11:20.734 --> 11:23.101
and I'm asking
you to hold off

11:23.167 --> 11:26.134
on any military
assault on our base.

11:26.201 --> 11:27.734
For what reason, sir?

11:27.800 --> 11:31.234
The Chinese agents who are
in possession of the component

11:31.301 --> 11:32.368
have been tracked

11:32.434 --> 11:34.368
to an oil platform
off our West Coast.

11:34.434 --> 11:38.134
We assume they're there
awaiting transport to China.

11:38.201 --> 11:41.468
I've ordered an air strike
to destroy the platform

11:41.533 --> 11:43.834
before that rendezvous
can happen.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.633
I realize that...

11:46.700 --> 11:50.800
you have no reason
to accept what I'm telling you.

11:50.867 --> 11:54.734
Not without proof, at least,
but I implore you...

11:54.800 --> 11:57.067
Mr. Vice President,
I believe you.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.734
Just moments ago, one
of our listening posts

11:59.800 --> 12:02.401
intercepted a transmission
to a Chinese submarine

12:02.468 --> 12:04.401
operating in the
western Pacific.

12:04.468 --> 12:07.734
The point of origin is
ten miles off your coast.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.500
And the contents suggest that
the submarine is en route

12:10.567 --> 12:13.700
to pick up the component.
Then you know that I'm
telling you the truth.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.434
You say you have
already launched

12:15.500 --> 12:17.267
an air strike
against this oil platform.

12:17.334 --> 12:20.533
Yes. That's the only way we can
make absolutely certain

12:20.600 --> 12:22.600
that the component's
been destroyed.

12:22.667 --> 12:23.934
Sir,

12:24.001 --> 12:26.600
we're prepared to give you
a real-time uplink

12:26.667 --> 12:29.234
to our satellite feed
of the assault operation.

12:29.301 --> 12:32.167
One moment, please, sir.

12:32.234 --> 12:36.368
(indistinct murmuring)

12:36.434 --> 12:39.368
Uh, how long until your fighters

12:39.434 --> 12:40.468
reach the target?

12:40.533 --> 12:42.767
Less than 20 minutes, sir.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.500
20 minutes,

12:44.567 --> 12:45.734
Mr. President.

12:48.234 --> 12:49.800
Very well,

12:49.867 --> 12:51.067
but be advised,

12:51.134 --> 12:53.101
nothing less than
the complete destruction

12:53.167 --> 12:54.734
of this oil platform
will give us

12:54.800 --> 12:56.401
the assurance we require.

12:56.468 --> 12:57.734
Understood.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.533
Stand by.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.767
The satellite feed will
be there momentarily.

13:01.834 --> 13:04.267
I wish you luck,
Mr. Vice President.

13:12.001 --> 13:13.468
Yes, the Coast Guard
and the Navy

13:13.533 --> 13:15.767
are coordinating directly.
They're patrolling a five-mile

13:15.834 --> 13:17.167
perimeter around
the target.

13:19.368 --> 13:21.001
Yes, sir. I'll keep
you in the loop.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.134
What is it, Morris?

13:22.201 --> 13:23.667
Jack's commandeered
a CTU chopper.

13:23.734 --> 13:27.234
He's requesting an uplink
to our satellite feed.
What?

13:27.301 --> 13:29.767
He's on the way to the
oil platform. He's
with Bill Buchanan.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.301
NADIA:
Arial One, please confirm.

13:37.368 --> 13:38.301
Come in.

13:38.368 --> 13:39.967
This is Bauer. We copy.

13:40.034 --> 13:42.034
Look, Jack, I know you
want to save your nephew,

13:42.101 --> 13:43.967
but I can't authorize
a suicide mission.

13:44.034 --> 13:46.001
We don't need your
authorization, Nadia,

13:46.067 --> 13:47.067
we need your help.

13:47.134 --> 13:48.767
Those F-18s will be
within striking range

13:48.834 --> 13:50.134
in 18 minutes.

13:50.201 --> 13:51.834
What if we find the
component first?

13:51.900 --> 13:53.234
It won't make a difference.

13:53.301 --> 13:54.567
The strike team's orders
are non-contingent.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.301
All you're gonna do
is get yourselves killed.

13:56.368 --> 13:57.468
BUCHANAN:
Nadia, it's Bill. Look,

13:57.533 --> 13:58.700
I understand the
pressure you're under,

13:58.767 --> 14:00.767
but you have to believe
me when I tell you--

14:00.834 --> 14:02.800
this is the right call to make.

14:07.867 --> 14:10.967
Morris said you need a visual
on the oil platform?

14:11.034 --> 14:12.567
Yes.
We need to know

14:12.633 --> 14:14.567
how many hostiles
are on the platform
and where they are.

14:14.633 --> 14:15.834
MORRIS:
Uploading the latest

14:15.900 --> 14:17.434
satellite capture.
Okay, you'll have it in

14:17.500 --> 14:19.600
a few seconds.
Copy that. Send it to my PDA.

14:19.667 --> 14:20.734
PDA? Got it.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.967
BUCHANAN:
Thank you, Nadia.

14:22.034 --> 14:23.500
You did the right thing.

14:31.834 --> 14:34.368
Bill, I need you to put
your comm unit in.

14:39.368 --> 14:41.767
How should I make
our approach, Jack?

14:41.834 --> 14:43.001
Wind's heavy out of the west.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.468
If we fly into it and
stay low to the water,

14:45.533 --> 14:47.101
we should be able to
catch them off-guard.

14:47.167 --> 14:48.334
It won't buy us much time.

14:48.401 --> 14:49.967
We'll have to engage
them from the air.

14:50.034 --> 14:51.600
I'll hold them off
so you can land,

14:51.667 --> 14:52.967
then we'll move in.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.834
The radar is locked
onto the target.

15:12.334 --> 15:13.734
Josh.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.167
We'll leave
in 15 minutes.

15:17.201 --> 15:19.734
Please just let me go.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.834
I can't do that.

15:20.900 --> 15:21.834
Why not?

15:21.900 --> 15:23.134
Because I can't.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.567
You have a
lot to learn.

15:27.633 --> 15:28.667
Now, it's my
responsibility

15:28.734 --> 15:31.267
to teach you. The
first lesson is...

15:31.334 --> 15:32.401
pay attention.

15:35.167 --> 15:42.533
(speaking Chinese)

15:45.967 --> 15:48.101
What is it?

15:48.167 --> 15:50.101
There's a helicopter
approaching.

15:50.167 --> 15:52.368
We need to get
to the boat and head west.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.600
There's a locator
beacon onboard.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.500
The submarine
will pick us up.

15:58.101 --> 16:00.067
Here. Take the component.

16:00.134 --> 16:02.201
I'll see about
the helicopter.

16:02.267 --> 16:04.334
I'll join you shortly.

16:21.867 --> 16:25.134
Once we hit the deck,
we're gonna have to move hard.

16:34.967 --> 16:36.067
You ready to move up?

16:36.134 --> 16:37.800
Ready!
Take it up!

16:45.201 --> 16:47.001
We're clear to land!

17:03.667 --> 17:05.166
(yelling)

17:16.834 --> 17:17.834
Don't move!

17:17.900 --> 17:20.599
Where's the boy?
Where is the boy?!

17:20.666 --> 17:21.867
You're too late.

17:23.267 --> 17:24.267
Take this. Get him

17:24.334 --> 17:26.201
up to the chopper
What are you doing?

17:26.267 --> 17:28.900
I'm gonna make sure Josh
isn't on this platform.

17:28.967 --> 17:30.234
We only have ten minutes!

17:30.301 --> 17:32.301
Get up! Get up!

17:56.334 --> 17:57.800
#Come on, Josh. Stop it.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.268
I can't.

17:59.334 --> 18:00.268
Of course you can.

18:00.334 --> 18:02.167
All it takes is a
little self-control.

18:03.334 --> 18:06.001
You're behaving like a child.

18:07.767 --> 18:11.533
You have to learn to
control your emotions.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.268
You must never let
them control you,

18:14.334 --> 18:15.567
you understand?

18:17.101 --> 18:19.167
Good.

18:19.234 --> 18:20.834
Come on.

18:33.867 --> 18:35.734
(gunshots)

18:43.301 --> 18:46.734
Target will be in range
in four minutes, 30 seconds.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.368
(groans)

19:08.433 --> 19:10.368
(panting)

19:12.234 --> 19:13.634
I'm not going with you.

19:18.234 --> 19:19.500
You're not gonna shoot me.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.067
Give me the gun.

19:23.967 --> 19:24.934
Now.

19:25.001 --> 19:25.834
No.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.500
As long as you're alive, me
and my mom will never be safe.

19:30.567 --> 19:33.268
Josh, listen to me.

19:33.334 --> 19:34.467
I've always cared about you.

19:34.533 --> 19:35.567
No!

19:35.634 --> 19:37.067
You only care
about yourself.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.334
That's not true.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.134
You're the reason
I'm doing all this.

19:40.201 --> 19:40.967
Shut up!

19:41.034 --> 19:41.967
I love you, Josh.

19:42.034 --> 19:43.201
(gunshot)
(groans)

19:49.634 --> 19:50.934
Josh!

19:53.167 --> 19:55.067
It's all right.
I've got him.

19:55.134 --> 19:56.334
You can lower that weapon.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.834
Josh!

20:02.167 --> 20:03.400
Lower your gun.

20:05.834 --> 20:09.433
I know how scared and angry
you must feel right now.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.800
I know. I've been exactly
where you are.

20:11.867 --> 20:15.001
I know exactly how
you feel, but you're

20:15.067 --> 20:16.433
gonna have to trust me on this.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.301
You do not want
to live with the pain

20:18.368 --> 20:21.500
of taking another person's
life, even if you think

20:21.567 --> 20:23.634
they deserve it.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.234
In a few minutes,
there's gonna be

20:25.301 --> 20:26.767
an F-18 air strike
on this platform.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.268
We need to get
out of here.

20:28.334 --> 20:29.901
We need to get
out of here now.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.101
Please.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.101
It's all right.

20:33.167 --> 20:34.901
Just give me the gun.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.101
It's all right.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.134
It's all right.

20:37.201 --> 20:38.234
It's over. It's over.

20:38.301 --> 20:39.934
I need you to get up

20:40.001 --> 20:41.234
to the top of
the platform

20:41.301 --> 20:42.533
and get in the
chopper now.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.533
Go. Move! 

20:43.600 --> 20:44.533
What about you?

20:44.600 --> 20:45.867
I'll be right behind you!

20:45.934 --> 20:46.867
Keep going!

20:46.934 --> 20:48.134
Get up.

20:50.368 --> 20:51.967
Get up!

20:52.034 --> 20:53.800
It's over.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.167
Then finish it.

20:55.234 --> 20:57.533
No.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.834
You are gonna be held
accountable for what you

20:59.901 --> 21:01.067
have done today.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.167
I don't think so.

21:03.834 --> 21:06.433
You don't have time to carry me,

21:06.500 --> 21:08.301
not if what you said
about the air strike

21:08.368 --> 21:10.734
is true.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.967
And you don't
want to die.

21:13.034 --> 21:16.101
Not here.

21:16.167 --> 21:18.433
Not with me.

21:26.967 --> 21:28.934
You're gonna get off easy.

21:45.767 --> 21:48.067
CTU, this is Aerial One.

21:48.134 --> 21:50.400
My count shows the
strike in two minutes.

21:50.467 --> 21:51.800
Negative. You
have 90 seconds

21:51.867 --> 21:54.634
before those F-18s are
within striking range.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.268
You need to
get off that
platform <i>now.</i>

21:58.268 --> 21:59.700
Bill. Confirm.

21:59.767 --> 22:02.101
Copy that! Stand by!

22:05.134 --> 22:06.934
Where's Jack?
He's with my grandpa.

22:07.001 --> 22:08.268
Get in!

22:13.634 --> 22:16.901
Mr. Vice President, the target
is in range. Strike team

22:16.967 --> 22:19.467
reports... missile lock.

22:20.634 --> 22:22.834
Take it out.

22:22.901 --> 22:27.301
Echo six-four is
clear to engage.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.867
Echo six-four,
you are clear to engage.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.967
Roger that.
Stand by for missile launch.

22:37.167 --> 22:39.433
Wait! We can't leave
without my uncle!

22:39.500 --> 22:41.067
We're not leaving. Hang on.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.167
Jack, I'm coming
around to the south.

22:45.234 --> 22:46.301
Meet me on level three.

22:46.368 --> 22:48.101
Copy that, Bill. I'm on it.

22:52.167 --> 22:54.167
Bill, I see you.

22:54.234 --> 22:56.001
I'm on the southwest corner.

23:00.334 --> 23:02.734
Fox One, fire.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.934
(grunts)

23:32.034 --> 23:34.034
Aerial
One, please
confirm.

23:36.001 --> 23:38.967
Bill, please confirm.

23:39.034 --> 23:41.034
Bill, this is Nadia.
Do you copy?

23:41.101 --> 23:42.567
BUCHANAN:
CTU, this is Aerial One.

23:42.634 --> 23:44.600
We copy.

23:44.667 --> 23:47.400
I've got Jack
and his nephew,

23:47.467 --> 23:48.667
and Cheng in custody.

23:48.734 --> 23:51.134
We're heading back to CTU.

23:51.201 --> 23:53.234
We'll have a landing crew
standing by, sir.

24:07.067 --> 24:09.034
Strike team reports multiple

24:09.101 --> 24:10.600
direct hits.

24:10.667 --> 24:14.268
Satellite recon
is reporting...

24:14.334 --> 24:17.101
target is completely

24:17.167 --> 24:18.433
destroyed.

24:20.934 --> 24:22.001
Good work.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.467
Mr. President, you're seeing
what we're seeing.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.368
Yes, we are.

24:29.433 --> 24:31.368
(indistinct murmuring)

24:32.867 --> 24:35.834
We concur that the target
has been eliminated.

24:35.901 --> 24:38.400
Then I trust you're satisfied
that the component's

24:38.467 --> 24:40.167
been destroyed, as well.

24:40.234 --> 24:42.334
I am.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.034
I'm ordering the full withdrawal
of our troops

24:46.101 --> 24:48.001
from the eastern rim of your

24:48.067 --> 24:49.700
military base.

24:49.767 --> 24:51.234
Good, Mr. President.

24:51.301 --> 24:53.901
You will excuse me if I wait
until your troops

24:53.967 --> 24:55.567
are completely withdrawn
before I order

24:55.634 --> 24:57.667
our squadrons in the air
to stand down.

24:57.734 --> 25:00.368
Yes, of course.

25:00.433 --> 25:03.301
And Mr. Vice President...

25:03.368 --> 25:07.134
I regret that the
events of this day

25:07.201 --> 25:08.967
have brought us
to such a dangerous

25:09.034 --> 25:11.901
and unfortunate
situation, but...

25:11.967 --> 25:14.834
when my country's security
is threatened...

25:14.901 --> 25:18.234
I understand, Mr. President,
all too well.

25:18.301 --> 25:21.101
Yes, I'm sure you do.

25:21.167 --> 25:24.533
My best wishes for the recovery
of President Palmer.

25:28.368 --> 25:30.067
Thank you.

25:31.201 --> 25:32.901
Good-bye, Mr. Vice President.

25:57.334 --> 25:58.533
What the hell happened?

25:58.600 --> 25:59.634
He fell!

25:59.700 --> 26:01.268
Uncle Jack fell!

26:03.533 --> 26:05.101
All right, I'm going back.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.467
He's all right.

26:51.301 --> 26:53.334
* *

27:03.533 --> 27:04.467
Where are we going?

27:04.533 --> 27:05.734
Back to CTU.

27:05.800 --> 27:08.001
No, we can't.
We have to go back for him.

27:08.067 --> 27:11.201
Jack's not ready to go back yet.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.433
#You should know, sir,

27:44.500 --> 27:46.667
we've received
confirmation

27:46.734 --> 27:50.634
the Chinese have recalled
their sub to its base in Ningpo.

27:52.767 --> 27:56.600
Tell Admiral Smith to have one
of our subs shadow them.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.801
I want the Chinese to
know that we're aware

27:58.867 --> 27:59.934
of their activities.
Yes, sir.

28:00.001 --> 28:03.567
And thank you, Ethan,
for everything.

28:03.634 --> 28:06.901
Extend my gratitude
to the Joint Chiefs.

28:06.967 --> 28:10.001
Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

28:12.834 --> 28:14.967
Sir, not to quash your flush
of victory here...

28:15.034 --> 28:17.667
the actions of the Chinese
cannot go unaddressed.

28:19.067 --> 28:21.634
We'll leave that
for another day, Tom.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.067
Right now, I don't know about
you, but I could use some sleep.

28:26.134 --> 28:28.134
There's just one other
outstanding issue

28:28.201 --> 28:30.034
I would like to
discuss with you, sir.

28:32.934 --> 28:34.567
Karen Hayes.

28:34.634 --> 28:38.333
Sir, she's about to be
transferred into FBI custody.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.101
Now in light of the recent
terrorist

28:41.168 --> 28:43.333
attacks, the nuke
in California,

28:43.400 --> 28:44.967
the plot against
the President,

28:45.034 --> 28:47.268
I just think we need
to preserve whatever...

28:47.333 --> 28:48.934
(sighs)

28:49.001 --> 28:51.734
...fragile faith the American
people might still have

28:51.801 --> 28:53.201
in this administration.

28:56.067 --> 29:01.834
Just let Karen and Bill resign
with their reputations intact.

29:05.667 --> 29:08.600
All right, Tom.

29:08.667 --> 29:10.600
Take care of that for me.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.134
All right.

29:12.201 --> 29:13.634
Thank you, sir.

29:16.433 --> 29:19.168
Here's that tape recording
you asked for.

29:31.367 --> 29:33.534
(sighs)

29:36.634 --> 29:37.600
Hey.

29:37.667 --> 29:38.600
Hi.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.400
How you feeling?
Good.

29:44.300 --> 29:46.867
Jack got the boy.
They're both safe.

29:46.934 --> 29:48.268
What about the Russians?

29:48.333 --> 29:49.767
They backed off.

29:49.834 --> 29:51.600
They were satisfied that
the component was destroyed.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.333
And Jack's father?

29:53.400 --> 29:54.834
He was killed in the air strike.

29:54.901 --> 29:56.801
And Cheng's
in custody.

29:56.867 --> 29:58.234
Good.
Look...

29:58.300 --> 29:59.500
um...

29:59.567 --> 30:02.134
I was talking
to Dr. Hastings.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.567
He says the test
results are in,

30:03.634 --> 30:04.801
but he's not
telling me anything.

30:04.867 --> 30:06.534
He insists I talk to you.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.967
Is it... serious?

30:12.034 --> 30:14.300
Yeah.

30:14.367 --> 30:17.734
Bloody hell, Chloe, whatever
it is, I'll help you get

30:17.801 --> 30:19.333
through it.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.667
No, you won't.
We're not together.

30:21.734 --> 30:22.967
Oh, sod that.

30:23.034 --> 30:24.734
Really, come on,

30:24.801 --> 30:27.168
when you collapsed,
I thought something

30:27.234 --> 30:29.201
might really be wrong.

30:29.268 --> 30:31.867
I can't lose you, darling.

30:31.934 --> 30:32.934
Really?

30:33.001 --> 30:34.467
Yeah, really.
I love you.

30:37.034 --> 30:39.034
Okay.

30:39.101 --> 30:42.034
That's good,
'cause I'm pregnant.

30:44.967 --> 30:46.467
You mean what?

30:46.534 --> 30:48.367
With child?

30:48.433 --> 30:51.534
That's usually how it works.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.001
(whispers):
Chloe...

30:57.067 --> 30:58.101
You know...

30:58.168 --> 31:01.168
this is a nice moment.

31:01.234 --> 31:04.600
Let's not ruin it by saying
something stupid.

31:04.667 --> 31:06.600
Let's just go back to work.

31:11.467 --> 31:12.867
Okay.

31:12.934 --> 31:14.767
Okay.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.967
Tom?
Karen.

31:29.034 --> 31:30.767
You've come to say

31:30.834 --> 31:31.634
good-bye?

31:31.700 --> 31:32.967
Well, in a manner
of speaking.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.967
You're free to go.

31:36.034 --> 31:39.234
The Vice President is dropping
all charges against you.

31:44.034 --> 31:45.067
What about Bill?

31:45.134 --> 31:46.134
He's being pardoned, as well.

31:46.201 --> 31:48.467
Of course,
the Vice President's

31:48.534 --> 31:50.234
still expecting
your resignations,

31:50.300 --> 31:52.433
but, uh... you're free to
go live your lives

31:52.500 --> 31:54.268
without fear of prosecution.

31:55.767 --> 31:58.700
Is that suitable?

31:58.767 --> 32:01.400
Yes. Yes.
Yes, it is.

32:01.467 --> 32:02.967
All right.
Well, good luck.

32:03.034 --> 32:05.801
I know you had a hand
in this, Tom.

32:05.867 --> 32:07.834
Thank you.

32:07.901 --> 32:09.067
You know, Karen,

32:09.134 --> 32:11.333
I actually think
I'm going to miss you.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.567
Really?

32:14.101 --> 32:16.134
I can answer that better
after you've gone.

32:44.367 --> 32:45.934
There's your mother.
Josh!

32:47.333 --> 32:50.067
(sobbing)

32:54.567 --> 32:57.534
You'll be debriefed at
a federal detention facility.

32:57.600 --> 33:01.700
My people will not abandon me
like you abandoned Jack Bauer.

33:04.034 --> 33:05.867
Get him out of here.

33:12.967 --> 33:15.001
It's good to see you
again, sir.

33:15.067 --> 33:17.567
You did good work today.
You should be proud.

33:17.634 --> 33:19.901
Thank you.

33:19.967 --> 33:21.600
That means a lot
coming from you.

33:26.433 --> 33:28.001
Where's Jack?

33:28.067 --> 33:30.500
He fell from the chopper

33:30.567 --> 33:33.268
into the ocean
during the extraction.

33:33.333 --> 33:35.934
He made it to shore;
he's fine.

33:36.001 --> 33:37.268
Why didn't you pick him up?

33:37.333 --> 33:39.201
He didn't want me to.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.700
I don't understand.
We need to find him.

33:42.767 --> 33:46.034
We'll never find him.
Not if he doesn't want us to.

33:47.834 --> 33:50.667
Let him go.

33:53.300 --> 33:56.667
Somehow it just
doesn't feel real.

33:56.734 --> 33:58.901
But I am grateful
that she's alive.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.500
Of course.

34:02.567 --> 34:05.734
I'll let you know.

34:05.801 --> 34:07.234
Thanks.

34:14.699 --> 34:16.433
(sighs)

34:16.500 --> 34:18.600
(door closing)

34:31.367 --> 34:33.101
Put it down.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.101
Now.

34:51.234 --> 34:52.600
Are you here to kill me?

34:52.667 --> 34:54.168
Depends.

34:54.234 --> 34:56.101
Where's Audrey?

34:56.168 --> 34:59.101
I told you before,
you're not getting

34:59.168 --> 35:00.667
anywhere near
my daughter...

35:00.734 --> 35:02.433
You do not tell me what
to do anymore!

35:02.500 --> 35:04.767
Do you understand me?

35:04.834 --> 35:07.567
You do not tell
me what to do.

35:09.367 --> 35:12.034
I just watched my father die...

35:12.101 --> 35:13.268
and I felt nothing.

35:13.333 --> 35:14.667
You know why?

35:16.400 --> 35:20.367
Yeah, you know why.

35:20.433 --> 35:22.834
Because that man was dead
to me years ago.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.367
I admired you, I looked up
to you like a father.

35:28.433 --> 35:30.433
You were the kind
of man I wanted to be.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.667
And you took
advantage of it!

35:31.734 --> 35:32.834
Jack, listen to me.

35:32.901 --> 35:35.967
No! You are going
to listen to me.

35:41.934 --> 35:44.067
Earlier today,

35:44.134 --> 35:46.634
you said that I was cursed.

35:46.700 --> 35:50.433
That anyone I touched...

35:50.500 --> 35:51.667
ended up dead

35:51.734 --> 35:53.667
or ruined.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.034
How dare you.

35:55.101 --> 35:59.134
How... dare you.

35:59.201 --> 36:00.734
The only thing I did,

36:00.801 --> 36:02.967
the only thing
I have ever done,

36:03.034 --> 36:05.767
is what you and people like you
have asked of me.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.067
Why didn't you try
to get me out of China?

36:14.134 --> 36:15.234
I did try.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.867
Not hard enough!

36:19.667 --> 36:21.433
You had the political power.

36:23.367 --> 36:25.168
Was the timing not right?

36:25.234 --> 36:28.734
Was it a little
too complicated?

36:28.801 --> 36:30.667
Or was I just
an acceptable loss?

36:30.734 --> 36:33.567
Jack, I understand your anger...

36:33.634 --> 36:35.367
Shut up!

36:38.534 --> 36:40.600
You don't understand
a thing about me.

36:43.234 --> 36:46.834
But I know you.

36:46.901 --> 36:48.934
I know why you're angry at me.

36:49.001 --> 36:51.600
And it wasn't because Audrey
went to China to save me.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.600
It was because when you
told her not to,

36:53.667 --> 36:57.067
she did it
anyway.

36:57.134 --> 37:00.067
You'll never understand
that kind of commitment,

37:00.134 --> 37:03.400
that kind
of loyalty.

37:03.467 --> 37:05.767
You're right, Jack.

37:08.168 --> 37:10.367
It wasn't fair of me
to put all this on you,

37:10.433 --> 37:11.967
to blame you for what
happened to Audrey.

37:12.034 --> 37:16.700
I know the sacrifices
you've made.

37:16.767 --> 37:21.534
I know this country owes you
more than it will ever repay.

37:21.600 --> 37:25.634
I'm not interested in what you
think this country owes me.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.567
I want my life back,

37:28.634 --> 37:31.934
and I want it now.

37:32.001 --> 37:33.967
Audrey's all I've got.

37:34.034 --> 37:36.967
And you can't stop me.

37:37.034 --> 37:39.400
In case you've
forgotten,

37:39.467 --> 37:42.234
I'm very good
at disappearing.

37:42.333 --> 37:44.567
And if you try sending
someone after us,

37:44.634 --> 37:46.700
I'm kill them.

37:46.767 --> 37:48.834
I'm pretty good at that, too.

37:52.134 --> 37:54.534
Simply getting your life
back, Jack,

37:54.600 --> 37:55.600
isn't going to change

37:55.667 --> 37:57.934
who you are.

37:58.001 --> 38:00.234
And you can't
walk away from it.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.634
You know that.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.001
You've tried it.

38:03.067 --> 38:05.667
Sooner or later you're going
to get back in the game.

38:05.734 --> 38:08.268
And my daughter's going
to pay the price,

38:08.333 --> 38:09.801
like your wife did.

38:13.901 --> 38:15.700
You son of a bitch.

38:15.767 --> 38:19.201
Jack, I beg you,
just stop for a moment

38:19.268 --> 38:22.067
and think.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.433
Think, Jack.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.534
You won't be able to take care
of her the way you want to.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.201
Where is she?

38:31.367 --> 38:34.467
Take me to her now.

39:00.801 --> 39:03.901
* *

39:31.500 --> 39:33.734
It's me. I'm here.

40:02.001 --> 40:04.433
I know that I promised...

40:05.901 --> 40:09.734
to take care of you...

40:09.801 --> 40:12.300
and protect you...

40:15.067 --> 40:18.168
But I'm at a crossroads.

40:23.067 --> 40:25.201
Right now, the best way...

40:31.867 --> 40:35.134
The only way...

40:35.201 --> 40:37.834
to do that is to let you go.

40:44.300 --> 40:47.300
I hope one day
you can understand that.

40:54.801 --> 40:57.801
I hope one day 
you can forgive me.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.534
I love you with all my heart.

41:33.667 --> 41:35.901
And I always will.
