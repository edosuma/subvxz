00:06.673 --> 00:09.426
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:10.802 --> 00:15.682
I promise you his death will ultimately
prove to be a noble sacrifice.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.062
- Sarah.
- It's good to see you.

00:22.523 --> 00:27.069
I found traces of a foreign chemical on
Teal'c's uniform and I've analysed it.

00:27.152 --> 00:32.073
I believe that Lieutenant Tyler, or the idea
of him, is nothing but a chemical implant.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.118
Apparently the one he serves
has no name.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.996
Oh, he has a name.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.251
The likes of you are simply
forbidden to know it.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.441 --> 01:08.902
Your guest has arrived.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.871
(distorted) You're to be congratulated.

01:18.996 --> 01:25.002
My sources have told me that you have
managed to amass an impressive army,

01:25.127 --> 01:27.629
in a relatively short amount of time.

01:28.839 --> 01:33.218
(distorted) I merely took advantage
of favourable conditions.

01:34.887 --> 01:39.099
The old order has fallen.
The System Lords are in disarray.

01:40.267 --> 01:45.230
Opportunities exist, but only for those
who are bold enough to seize them.

01:45.564 --> 01:48.734
What are you proposing? An alliance?

01:49.860 --> 01:52.112
No.

01:52.237 --> 01:56.533
But I am offering you a position of power
in exchange for your support.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.077
Osiris serves no one.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.997
You least of all.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.460
You once served lsis.

02:06.585 --> 02:10.005
She was my queen. She served me.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.675
Interesting.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.054
Interesting that you now
choose a female host.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.307
A most attractive one at that.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.645
- You waste my time.
- You misunderstand.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.107
I'm not asking that you serve me.

02:29.191 --> 02:34.196
I must admit that I'm merely an emissary
for a much more powerful Goa'uld.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.157
One whom you once knew well.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.537
Of whom do you speak?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.583
Anubis.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.200
(technician)
Unauthorised offworld activation.

04:07.206 --> 04:10.709
Receiving IDC transmission, sir.
It's the Tok'ra.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.880
- Open the iris.
- Oh, here we go.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.436
- Ren'al.
- General Hammond.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.814
- This is SG-1 .
- I am familiar with all your exploits.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.569
- Your father Jacob sends his regards.
- How is he?

04:37.694 --> 04:40.614
On a mission at the moment,
which is the reason I am here.

04:40.697 --> 04:45.077
There is a serious situation developing
regarding the System Lords.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.371
Briefing room.

04:52.668 --> 04:56.964
It's always suicide-mission this,
save-the-planet that.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.926
No one ever just stops by
to say hi any more.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.515
The deaths of Cronus and Apophis
created a power vacuum

05:06.598 --> 05:09.268
that the other System Lords
have tried to exploit.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.478
Recently they've suffered heavy losses

05:11.603 --> 05:16.733
and expended an enormous amount of
resources fighting amongst themselves.

05:16.859 --> 05:21.238
- Let the good times roll.
- They may be coming to an end.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.868
They've declared a truce and now
they're going to have a meeting

05:25.993 --> 05:29.079
to discuss the establishment
of a new order.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.332
- So you want to stop them.
- Quite the opposite, actually.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.501
We want them to meet.

05:34.626 --> 05:39.006
It'll give us the rare opportunity
to strike against all of them at once.

05:39.131 --> 05:42.384
You're talking about taking out
the entire Goa'uld leadership?

05:42.467 --> 05:45.470
- We are.
- Welcome to the dark side.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.558
This has always been
part of our long-term plan.

05:50.350 --> 05:55.606
We just weren't quite prepared for the
opportunity to present itself so quickly.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.818
Where exactly is
this meeting taking place?

05:59.902 --> 06:04.781
At a space station in the Hassara system.
It's considered neutral territory.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.743
Security will be tight.
No weapons will be permitted.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.995
Access will be by cargo ship only.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.373
- Defences?
- Impenetrable.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.251
Could we gain entrance
on one of the cargo ships?

06:16.335 --> 06:19.922
They'll be scanned
at their approach to the station.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.301
OK. Let's hear it.

06:25.177 --> 06:30.057
Every System Lord in attendance will be
permitted to bring one human slave.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.726
You want one of us to do it.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.438
Specifically we need someone
who speaks fluent Goa'uld.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.986
Someone who is not Jaffa.

06:46.657 --> 06:51.286
If you agree to participate, we ask
that you come to our base tomorrow.

06:51.411 --> 06:55.332
Jacob will be there. He will tell you
all you will need to know.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.672
It is up to you, Dr Jackson.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.983
- Daniel Jackson.
- Yeah.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.363
Have you considered
the Tok'ra proposal?

07:26.488 --> 07:27.948
Yeah.

07:28.073 --> 07:31.410
If successful, it would deal
the Goa'uld a mortal blow.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.371
Yeah. I realise what's at stake.

07:34.496 --> 07:38.876
Daniel Jackson, you have stated many
times that in circumstances such as this

07:38.959 --> 07:42.713
you would avoid using such action
if given a better option.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.716
Right.

07:45.841 --> 07:50.053
You think there's a better way
of overthrowing the Goa'uld?

07:50.721 --> 07:55.809
I currently have no plan that would
accomplish as much as that of the Tok'ra.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.230
That's why I'm gonna do it.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.453
- Ten hut!
- At ease.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.622
- Major.
- Colonel.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.208
I see you drew the short straw.

08:22.628 --> 08:25.797
- Lieutenant Elliot, your first assignment.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:25.881 --> 08:29.051
Be nice to see a little action for a change.

08:29.176 --> 08:34.014
It's just your basic offworld orientation,
Lieutenant. There is no action.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.893
Maybe not, sir, but I am
looking forward to meeting the Tok'ra.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.479
You'll get over it.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.421
Welcome to Revanna.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.884
- Hi, Dad.
- It's good to see you, Sam.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.096
- Jack, how are you?
- Kinda curious.

09:15.973 --> 09:20.185
Some of you know Aldwin. He'll conduct
the orientation for your new officers.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.354
First, a tour of the facilities.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.399
After that, a lecture on Tok'ra
insurgency techniques

09:25.524 --> 09:28.777
since the collapse of
the second Goa'uld dynasty.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.240
I take it all back, Lieutenant.
This could be hot.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.078
Come.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.422
So how are you gonna get me in?

09:49.381 --> 09:52.634
Yu will be among the System Lords
attending the meeting.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.970
I thought you said
he was going in as a slave.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.139
The System Lord Yu.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.851
Little joke there.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.519
Funny.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.355
Yu knows my face. He'll recognise me.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.566
He will not.

10:07.649 --> 10:12.571
Ren'al has been working on a version
of the chemical obtained from the Reol.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.324
If you can get close enough to inject him,

10:15.449 --> 10:19.661
you'll be able to convince him that
you are in fact his most trusted Io'taur.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.914
His... what?

10:22.039 --> 10:25.459
Lo'taur is the highest rank among
the human slaves of the System Lords.

10:25.584 --> 10:30.130
They're like personal attendants. It's
considered a position of great honour.

10:30.214 --> 10:34.843
I spent the last two months establishing
myself as a minor Goa'uld in Yu's service.

10:34.927 --> 10:40.098
I'll be able to get Daniel on board his
mothership and deal with the loose ends.

10:40.224 --> 10:41.475
What if Nirrti shows up?

10:41.600 --> 10:46.480
She's still a renegade and persona
non grata among the System Lords.

10:46.605 --> 10:50.192
None of the other remaining
System Lords have seen Daniel's face.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.946
Assuming I make it on the space station,
what happens next?

10:54.071 --> 10:58.742
You will wait until all the System Lords
have arrived and then you will use this.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.663
These two liquids mixed together
form a most virulent poison.

11:02.788 --> 11:06.124
Press the button to open the valve
between the two containers.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.293
The liquid will be vaporised.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.797
Within seconds the pressure
will break the seal on the container

11:11.922 --> 11:14.925
and the gas will be released.

11:17.761 --> 11:22.391
- Am I supposed to hold my breath?
- The poison is only deadly to symbiotes.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.935
- Isn't that dangerous?
- More than you know.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.356
There's enough material in that vial to kill
every Tok'ra on this base twice over.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.484
(Ren'al) This formula is our
most closely guarded secret.

11:32.568 --> 11:35.571
- And it doesn't kill the host?
- Not the chemical itself.

11:35.654 --> 11:38.907
But, as you know, the dying symbiote
releases its own toxin,

11:38.991 --> 11:41.243
which is just as deadly.

11:43.871 --> 11:47.332
Daniel, the human host of a System Lord

11:47.457 --> 11:50.544
has been through the sarcophagus
countless times.

11:50.669 --> 11:55.048
We know the toll that takes. They're
hundreds, maybe thousands of years old.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.634
Never mind the psychological damage,

11:57.759 --> 12:02.306
physically, without the Goa'uld
sustaining them, they die anyway.

12:03.098 --> 12:07.144
- So we're doing them a favour.
- In many ways, yes.

12:09.730 --> 12:13.275
- How many targets?
- Seven System Lords at the meeting.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.822
That's all the major players. If we pull
this off, the Goa'uld may never recover.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.911
- What can we do?
- Wait here.

12:24.036 --> 12:27.998
I'll communicate when the mission
has been accomplished.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.961
Jacob!

12:33.086 --> 12:35.130
Jacob, wait up.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.553
Why do I think there's something
you're not telling us?

12:41.637 --> 12:43.180
Now, come on!

12:43.305 --> 12:46.767
You're always saying that every time
we knock off a System Lord

12:46.892 --> 12:49.811
a worse one shows up.
Why should this be any different?

12:49.937 --> 12:52.064
Others would eventually rise up,

12:52.189 --> 12:55.108
but by taking them all out at once
we create a power vacuum

12:55.234 --> 12:59.905
Ieading to a galaxywide war as the
remaining Goa'uld jockey for position.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.283
That'll last long enough for us
to make a final, decisive move.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.826
Which is?

13:04.952 --> 13:10.207
A wide-scale attack on the entire Goa'uld
population, using the symbiote poison.

13:10.332 --> 13:13.335
We're gonna wipe them out, Jack.
All of 'em.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.268
Why have I been enlisted for this task?

13:29.351 --> 13:32.688
Politics have always been
one of your greater skills.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.731
And am I to go alone?

13:34.815 --> 13:37.985
I have my own mission
upon which I must embark.

13:41.905 --> 13:46.952
Apparently, the Tok'ra have developed
a formidable new weapon.

13:47.369 --> 13:51.665
- How do you know?
- I captured a Tok'ra spy in my midst.

13:52.165 --> 13:56.295
I doubt very much a Tok'ra
would reveal this information,

13:56.378 --> 13:58.839
no matter how you tortured him.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.718
You are correct.

14:02.843 --> 14:06.513
But Anubis has methods
that would impress you.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.225
What are you going to do?

14:11.268 --> 14:14.771
I am... going to take this weapon
from the Tok'ra

14:18.567 --> 14:21.028
and destroy them.

14:39.671 --> 14:43.091
So why do the System Lords
need human attendants?

14:43.926 --> 14:46.678
Well, the Jaffa serve
a strictly military function.

14:46.762 --> 14:51.975
Besides, if a System Lord's host is injured
beyond their symbiote's capacity to heal,

14:52.100 --> 14:55.604
it can be pretty useful
to have a human close at hand.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.315
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

14:59.066 --> 15:03.529
- Are you clear on all the System Lords?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

15:03.654 --> 15:07.491
Good. We'll be at Yu's home world
in a little over an hour.

15:09.993 --> 15:13.080
- Are you all right, Daniel?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

15:19.711 --> 15:23.048
I just think some of your details
are a little, uh... sketchy.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.217
Like what?

15:25.342 --> 15:28.971
- We'll use poison to wipe out the Goa'uld.
- Eventually.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.516
- What about the Jaffa?
- Well, that's still a bit of a wrinkle.

15:32.641 --> 15:37.646
Unless we can reverse their biological
dependency on immature symbiotes,

15:37.771 --> 15:40.440
they'll all die as well.

15:40.566 --> 15:42.192
A bit of a wrinkle.

15:42.276 --> 15:46.655
Daniel, the Goa'uld have been spreading
across the galaxy for thousands of years.

15:46.738 --> 15:50.492
Now they're showing zero population
growth. We're not sure why.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.620
But we intend to take
advantage of the situation.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.290
We may never get
a chance like this again.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.170
Are we good to go?

16:01.837 --> 16:03.380
Yeah.

16:11.346 --> 16:16.018
When the Tok'ra arrive on a planet, we
go underground as quickly as possible.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.979
And you actually grow these tunnels
from crystals?

16:19.104 --> 16:24.318
Correct. Crystals are programmed with
the specific layout of a given passageway,

16:24.443 --> 16:28.071
allowing us to structure
the tunnel system as we see fit.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.992
- What about ventilation shafts?
- There are none.

16:32.117 --> 16:37.623
If we tunnel through suitable rock such as
calcium carbonate, oxygen is produced.

16:37.706 --> 16:42.169
This gives us enough time to enter the
tunnels and set up life-support systems.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.379
- Colonel.
- Sir.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.757
Gentlemen.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.343
How goes the orientation?

16:49.468 --> 16:53.013
It's very interesting, sir,
just as you predicted.

16:53.931 --> 16:57.100
Are you interested in Tok'ra engineering?

16:57.184 --> 17:01.230
Oh, "interested" doesn't
quite describe how I truly feel.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.816
You're welcome to join us.

17:07.444 --> 17:12.657
Thank you, Aldwin, but I have to
go help Teal'c... wait for Daniel.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.536
Excuse me.

17:27.798 --> 17:32.594
I can get you into Yu's quarters. Your job
is to get close enough to use this.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.808
All you have to do is prick him... once.

17:38.684 --> 17:43.063
The effect will be immediate. He'll believe
you to be his loyal slave Jarren.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.483
- Jarren?
- Just don't jab yourself with it.

17:48.527 --> 17:51.196
- Why?
- Actually I don't know exactly.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.283
That in itself should scare you.

18:01.999 --> 18:05.085
As you know, we kept the body
in stasis for several months

18:05.169 --> 18:07.671
as we tried to find a way
to repair the damage.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.716
But in the end we were unsuccessful.

18:10.841 --> 18:14.261
All that is left of Martouf
now lives on in Lantash.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.849
What's its condition?

18:18.974 --> 18:24.146
The symbiote is still recuperating, but
the search has begun to find a new host.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.275
- I wanna see the research.
- I'm sorry, Major.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.944
All information about Zatarc technology...

18:31.069 --> 18:34.156
Can only be released on the authority
of the Council. I know.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.491
They've been stonewalling me
for months.

18:36.617 --> 18:39.369
I assure you Martouf was in no pain.

18:39.453 --> 18:41.997
- That's not the problem.
- What then?

18:42.915 --> 18:45.751
If the symbiote was alive
when Martouf came out of stasis,

18:45.876 --> 18:48.253
couldn't it have healed his injuries?

18:48.378 --> 18:51.215
- The possibility was remote.
- How remote?

18:51.340 --> 18:55.469
The host was too weak. In all likelihood
the symbiote would have died.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.763
- You don't know that.
- We had to choose.

18:57.888 --> 19:02.351
- And naturally you chose the symbiote.
- Your bias toward the host is only natural.

19:02.476 --> 19:05.562
It is better that one should live
than that they both die.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.649
Isn't this really about
your Zatarc research?

19:09.983 --> 19:12.402
- I don't understand.
- If Martouf had lived,

19:12.528 --> 19:16.406
you couldn't have examined his brain
tissue. You'd have learned nothing.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.535
Would you have preferred
his sacrifice to be for nothing?

19:19.618 --> 19:22.287
I would have preferred another way.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.543
- You knew Martouf well?
- Yes.

19:27.626 --> 19:32.256
Well, knowing him as you did, what
choice do you think he would have made?

19:35.801 --> 19:38.387
Martouf is not entirely gone, Major.

19:38.512 --> 19:42.057
His thoughts and his memories
live on in Lantash.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.000
Jarren.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.295
My lord does not wish
to be disturbed at this time.

20:17.134 --> 20:20.888
- I don't look a thing like this guy.
- For this work you don't have to.

20:21.013 --> 20:24.391
You'll be fine. Just remember
to pour from the right.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.885
Kel shak Jarren?

21:04.181 --> 21:06.225
Aric kree Onak.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.064
Nis trah Jarren.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.280
I am your loyal servant Jarren.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.992
Rise.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.668
I will have my tea.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.258
(alarm)

21:44.471 --> 21:47.140
- What's goin' on?
- We've received a transmission.

21:47.266 --> 21:51.395
Our sensors have detected a fleet
of motherships bound for Revanna.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.772
You must leave immediately.

21:57.526 --> 22:01.572
An incoming wormhole's blocking
our escape through the Stargate.

22:01.697 --> 22:05.075
The Goa'uld can only sustain
a wormhole for 38 minutes.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.703
The ships will be here before then.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.873
There is no other escape.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.062
Identify yourselves.

22:38.817 --> 22:42.738
I represent the Jade Emperor,
the exulted Lord Yu Huang Shang-Ti.

22:42.863 --> 22:46.200
Two life signs scanned.
No weapons detected.

22:46.283 --> 22:48.327
Lowering shields.

22:48.869 --> 22:51.788
Our fellow System Lords
are not to be trusted.

22:53.498 --> 22:57.127
- Neither are their slaves.
- Understood, my lord.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.442
Do you have any ships available?

23:20.567 --> 23:23.737
A few unarmed cargo ships,
but they're on other missions.

23:23.820 --> 23:27.324
- We have begun making new tunnels.
- What good is that gonna do?

23:27.449 --> 23:30.118
Spread out the risk of
getting hit by an air attack.

23:30.202 --> 23:34.873
You could lend us a hand moving
life-support equipment and supplies.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.794
- Major, lend him a hand.
- Yes, sir.

23:55.644 --> 23:58.647
- What are you doing?
- I'm cutting power to the base.

23:58.730 --> 24:01.817
The energy signature would
give away our position.

24:01.942 --> 24:05.404
- They must use random bombardment.
- That's encouraging.

24:05.529 --> 24:09.908
Colonel, the Tok'ra have never had
the military resources of the Goa'uld.

24:10.033 --> 24:14.705
We use disguise and subterfuge.
Our bases are designed to be hidden.

24:14.830 --> 24:18.375
We are just not equipped to repulse
such a large enemy force.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.295
Well, they're not just gonna go away.

24:21.420 --> 24:25.048
I can assure you, Major,
if this base is compromised,

24:25.174 --> 24:28.343
we will fight until
the last of us has fallen.

24:31.096 --> 24:34.349
With what? Zats?

24:35.559 --> 24:39.438
- What else is there?
- Well, you've got that poison.

24:39.563 --> 24:44.193
If it's half as good as you say it is, it could
wipe out any potential ground assault.

24:44.276 --> 24:46.320
And risk killing every Tok'ra as well?

24:46.445 --> 24:50.574
Hey! We're all gonna die
if we sit around and wait for the attack.

24:52.618 --> 24:56.997
Believe me. If it came down to it,
we would sacrifice ourselves,

24:57.080 --> 24:59.833
and use the poison on our enemy
if we had some.

24:59.958 --> 25:04.588
Unfortunately the only quantity in
existence is in Selmak's possession.

25:06.381 --> 25:09.134
It would take weeks to synthesise more.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.756
Lord Yu Huang Shang-Ti.

25:59.810 --> 26:02.145
Note them, Jarren.

26:02.271 --> 26:04.523
My future allies.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.447
(Daniel) Bastet, Kali the Destroyer.

26:13.615 --> 26:17.286
They made a treaty with Sobek, then
attacked him in the celebratory feast.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.454
Sobek let his guard down.

26:19.580 --> 26:23.876
Rumour has it his head still decorates
Bastet's palace in Bubastis.

26:23.959 --> 26:28.505
You have a good memory.
They are still worthy of my allegiance.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.803
Do not accept gifts from Baal.

26:35.345 --> 26:39.808
They have a habit of exploding, especially
when he feels he has been slighted.

26:39.892 --> 26:42.644
He wiped out two star systems,
60 million lives,

26:42.728 --> 26:45.647
rather than lose them to Sokar
in a territorial dispute.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.192
Poor loser.

26:54.156 --> 26:56.491
Do not consort with Morrigan's servant.

26:56.617 --> 27:00.746
He will attempt to draw out strategic
information in idle conversation.

27:00.829 --> 27:05.209
I know your last servant gave away
the location of one of your secret bases.

27:05.334 --> 27:07.628
He was killed in the surprise attack.

27:07.753 --> 27:11.215
It is what has given me
the honour to serve you, my lord.

27:17.721 --> 27:22.184
Olokun is still seething over
a recent loss to my forces.

27:22.267 --> 27:24.811
He may try to kill you out of spite.

27:26.230 --> 27:30.776
Do not make me look foolish
by allowing yourself to be murdered.

27:30.859 --> 27:33.278
Yes, my lord.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.118
Yu.

27:43.580 --> 27:47.501
I am pleased you were able to join us,
given recent events.

27:48.418 --> 27:51.338
I understand your fleet
suffered some heavy losses.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.757
I am not the only one.

27:53.882 --> 27:57.469
Did I not hear your new flagship
was destroyed?

27:57.594 --> 27:59.805
I lost 2,000 Jaffa.

28:00.806 --> 28:03.225
- Such is war.
- No!

28:03.559 --> 28:07.354
This is different.
This enemy attacks like a coward.

28:09.356 --> 28:12.442
Bastet and Kali have suffered
similar setbacks.

28:12.568 --> 28:18.907
They are more frequent, while the identity
of our antagonist continues to elude us.

28:19.283 --> 28:21.618
I'm certain you have your suspicions.

28:21.743 --> 28:25.873
We're all suffering at the hands
of this unknown adversary.

28:25.956 --> 28:29.418
By shrouding himself,
he sows discord amongst us.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.988
Mansfield, it's O'Neill. Report.

29:02.451 --> 29:05.120
A section of the structure collapsed.

29:07.039 --> 29:09.374
We have some injured Tok'ra here.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.754
- Sir, we got another one.
- Get 'em outta there.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.632
Roger that. Let's go. We gotta move.

29:17.716 --> 29:20.886
- Elliot, let's go.
- He's still alive, sir.

29:34.650 --> 29:37.110
Major, what's your situation?

29:38.904 --> 29:41.365
Mansfield, report!

29:47.371 --> 29:50.374
The al-kesh continue to bomb
the area around the gate.

29:50.457 --> 29:52.960
No Tok'ra have surfaced
and attempted escape.

29:53.085 --> 29:55.921
Escape? There's no escape.

29:56.004 --> 30:00.717
They hide in their tunnels like rats.
Continue the bombardment.

30:01.510 --> 30:04.930
Prepare your ground troops
for infiltration.

30:09.268 --> 30:11.353
- Elliot.
- Direct hit, sir.

30:11.478 --> 30:13.689
- Where's the rest of your team?
- They're dead.

30:13.814 --> 30:16.316
Sir, we need to get him to the infirmary.

30:17.109 --> 30:21.905
- The infirmary has been destroyed.
- We'll take them to the lab. Follow me.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.719
I'm transferring the formula
for the poison to this crystal.

30:44.511 --> 30:47.514
And I'm erasing
the memory of the computer.

30:49.474 --> 30:52.394
We'll die before we give up our secrets.

30:52.477 --> 30:55.814
You know, we really should
come up with a new strategy.

30:55.939 --> 30:58.150
One that does not include us dying.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.486
We must know what is
happening on the surface.

31:01.612 --> 31:06.325
We're cut off from the surface sensors.
You must use the secondary ring room.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.619
Show them.

31:27.679 --> 31:29.139
Jacob.

31:29.223 --> 31:31.892
Jacob, are you there? It's Daniel.

31:36.563 --> 31:40.859
- Daniel, how's it goin'?
- It's kinda like Goa'uldan Mardi Gras.

31:41.652 --> 31:44.571
A shipjust docked,
so by my count you got all seven.

31:44.655 --> 31:48.033
- It's time to release the poison.
- We may wanna hold off a while.

31:48.158 --> 31:50.702
- They're expecting someone else.
- Who?

31:50.827 --> 31:55.123
I don't know. It seems they've got
some mysterious new adversary.

31:55.582 --> 31:59.461
That's strange. It's not like
a Goa'uld to play it so coy.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.257
I'll see what I can find out.
I'll contact you later.

32:10.055 --> 32:12.516
We have to get him out of here.

32:14.476 --> 32:17.479
- He needs medical attention.
- We've done what we can.

32:17.563 --> 32:19.940
- What about the symbiote?
- Out of the question.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.109
It could save Major Mansfield's life.

32:22.234 --> 32:27.573
The symbiote's life is being sustained
by the chamber. It can't help your friend.

32:30.534 --> 32:33.453
- We can't just let him die.
- If we implant the symbiote,

32:33.537 --> 32:35.622
we kill them both.

33:23.962 --> 33:26.548
They appear to be amassing a few troops.

33:27.674 --> 33:32.429
Once the air bombardment exposes
the tunnels, they will infiltrate them.

33:32.554 --> 33:34.598
Carter, come in.

33:37.309 --> 33:39.561
Carter, respond.

33:42.523 --> 33:44.775
Let's get back.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.957
This has gone on long enough.

34:00.082 --> 34:03.168
We must determine who is
responsible for these attacks.

34:03.293 --> 34:06.213
The coward refuses to show himself.

34:06.296 --> 34:10.259
He only strikes with his ships,
never with ground troops.

34:10.384 --> 34:13.719
Have none of you seen
the faces of the enemy Jaffa?

34:16.806 --> 34:18.891
I have.

34:19.016 --> 34:22.020
When my outpost at Cerador
came under assault,

34:22.145 --> 34:26.608
my first prime managed to disable
and board one of the enemy ships.

34:28.110 --> 34:31.029
- Did you take any prisoners?
- They fought to the death.

34:31.154 --> 34:34.074
Most had been in the service
of Cronus and Sokar,

34:34.199 --> 34:37.202
but one bore the mark of Olokun.

34:41.790 --> 34:44.251
How do you explain this?

34:47.754 --> 34:51.507
One of my motherships
was surrounded by the enemy.

34:51.632 --> 34:56.388
Instead of dying with honour,
the cowards surrendered and were taken.

34:58.640 --> 35:03.729
- They may well have switched allegiance.
- And you expect us to believe this?

35:03.854 --> 35:07.274
I too have suffered
at the hands of this unseen foe.

35:08.317 --> 35:11.153
How dare you accuse me!

35:19.328 --> 35:22.789
My lords, the final guest has arrived.

35:42.768 --> 35:45.187
I hope I'm not missing all the fun.

36:02.579 --> 36:07.417
- Welcome, Osiris.
- I thank you for honouring my request.

36:08.085 --> 36:13.215
Normally your petition for a seat here
would not have been considered.

36:13.340 --> 36:16.593
Of course, the current situation
is far from normal.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.603
Jarren.

36:46.748 --> 36:50.669
I think you'll find I have much to offer.

36:52.296 --> 36:54.965
Shall we proceed?

37:16.486 --> 37:19.573
- (bleeping)
- What's that?

37:19.698 --> 37:22.451
A warning. The Jaffa
have breached the tunnels.

37:22.534 --> 37:24.578
O'Neill!

37:49.770 --> 37:51.813
He is dead.

39:33.665 --> 39:35.918
Lieutenant?

39:40.214 --> 39:42.257
Oh, my God.

39:46.136 --> 39:48.972
- Lantash.
- (distorted) I had no choice.

39:51.308 --> 39:52.935
Elliot?

39:53.018 --> 39:57.564
I'm afraid his injuries are severe.
He has serious internal damage.

39:59.775 --> 40:03.612
It's going to take all my strength
just to keep him alive.

40:08.325 --> 40:10.744
He will have to speak for both of us.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.257
- Major.
- Elliot.

40:23.382 --> 40:26.468
- It's gonna be OK.
- If you say so.

40:26.927 --> 40:31.890
Believe me, I know. The symbiote's
trying to heal you, OK?

40:34.184 --> 40:36.061
OK.

40:36.395 --> 40:38.814
OK.

41:00.961 --> 41:01.879
Carter?

41:02.004 --> 41:05.174
The ceiling collapsed, sir.
Ren'al and Major Mansfield are dead.

41:05.299 --> 41:06.842
As is Aldwin.

41:06.925 --> 41:10.095
Elliot's in rough shape.
There's a Tok'ra symbiote in him.

41:10.220 --> 41:13.223
- What?
- It feels very weird, sir.

41:13.599 --> 41:16.351
Lantash. He's keeping him alive.

41:17.352 --> 41:19.396
(bombardment)

41:21.481 --> 41:23.942
Let's take our chances on the surface.

41:42.461 --> 41:44.463
Jacob.

41:44.588 --> 41:46.924
What's the delay?
They should all be there now.

41:47.049 --> 41:50.302
Yeah, we got a full house,
but there's a complication.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.471
Daniel?

41:53.263 --> 41:55.557
- Sarah's here.
- Sarah...

41:56.391 --> 42:00.687
You mean Osiris?
Did she recognise you?

42:00.896 --> 42:05.442
I don't know. I think so, but she didn't
tip her hand and I don't know why.

42:08.612 --> 42:11.073
Daniel Jackson.

42:12.783 --> 42:16.370
You're a rather long way
from home, aren't you?

42:41.895 --> 42:43.772
The tunnel's blocked.

42:43.856 --> 42:48.068
Does Lantash know if there's
another way to the secondary ring room?

42:48.151 --> 42:50.654
There isn't.

42:50.779 --> 42:53.282
Then indeed we are trapped.
