00:02.302 --> 00:05.066
How about the scam the airlines
have with these special clubs?

00:06.439 --> 00:08.737
One hundred fifty dollars a year
to sit in a room...

00:08.908 --> 00:12.400
...eat peanuts, drink coffee and soda
and read magazines.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.309
Excuse me, isn't this the flight?

00:15.482 --> 00:18.349
I already got four hours of this
coming to me.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.452
What am I paying for?

00:20.620 --> 00:22.315
How about an
l-got-all-my-luggage club?

00:22.489 --> 00:25.720
Can I get into that? Where's that club?
I would like to join that club.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.023
Airlines love to divide us up
into classes, you know?

00:31.197 --> 00:32.595
When you're sitting in coach...

00:32.766 --> 00:36.167
...they always have the stewardess
close that stupid curtain, you know?

00:36.336 --> 00:37.633
They give you that look like:

00:37.804 --> 00:40.238
"Maybe if you had worked
a little harder...."

00:44.644 --> 00:46.168
What time does your flight get in?

00:46.346 --> 00:48.576
Six? All right,
that gives us six hours.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.739
Then I'll meet you
at the Diplomat's Club.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.942
I'll be the one without
the big red sash.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.950
Okay. See you tonight.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.557
-Is that the supermodel?
-Yep.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.489
She's not gonna be back
for a month, but I have six hours.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.219
I thought you had a show in lthaca.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.260
I do, but it's 3:00.
I'm flying right back.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.866
Then I'm gonna meet Bridgette
at the Diplomat's Club.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.501
Well, guess what I'm doing.

01:09.669 --> 01:14.732
I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am
telling him that I am quitting.

01:15.642 --> 01:16.904
So that's it?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.738
You know, I never even met the guy.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.176
I've had enough. I am marching in.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.338
-You're marching in?
-I'm marching.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.584
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey, Elaine's quitting.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.914
-Really?
-I'm marching in.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.784
I've done the march in.
Best feeling.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.721
-How about the march out?
-Not as good.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.827
You realize all the money
you're losing.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.753
Oh, boy. Okay, that's it.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.763
-Wish me luck.
-Yeah.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.128
Get a march going.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.102
March it.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.431
-Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
-Why?

01:46.606 --> 01:49.541
Well, I wanna put a picture of me
and my boss up in the office.

01:49.709 --> 01:50.937
What for?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.102
Well, he's reorganizing
the whole staff...

01:53.279 --> 01:55.270
...and I'm on thin ice
with this guy as it is.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.975
Isn't putting his picture on your desk
a little transparent?

01:59.152 --> 02:00.847
It better be.

02:07.427 --> 02:10.294
-Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
-One second, Elaine.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.294
-Mr. Pitt--
-Elaine.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.864
Do you know what I just did?

02:14.033 --> 02:17.696
I just amended my will
to include you as a beneficiary.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.460
What?

02:19.639 --> 02:21.470
Well, I think of you
as part of my family.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.370
You've come to be like
a daughter to me.

02:23.543 --> 02:26.637
I want to make sure that you're
taken care of after I'm gone.

02:28.781 --> 02:30.646
Mr. Pitt.

02:31.784 --> 02:35.515
I feel a cold coming on.
Could you get me a cold pill?

02:35.688 --> 02:37.053
Oh, no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.488
You have to check before you combine
anything with your heart medicine.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.821
Yes, yes. I'll check with
the pharmacist.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.191
We don't want anything
to happen to you, Mr. Pitt.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.993
We want you to live
a long, long time.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.734
Look at that,
I only got one picture left.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.068
How about a shot of me
and Mr. Morgan?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.169
-Why?
-Why?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.174
Because we're a team. Come on.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.781
Would you take this for us, dear?
Thank you very much. Here we go.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.345
Anyone ever tell you you look
a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.489
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, you must hear that all the time.

03:10.657 --> 03:13.785
I suppose we all look alike
to you, right, Costanza?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.861
What? What? No, no, no.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.898
No, no, it's not a racial thing.
There really is a resemblance.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.633
Don't you think
he looks like Sugar Ray?

03:24.904 --> 03:28.431
Come on, somebody.
Back me up.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.867
Come on. A little help.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.405
Maybe he looks a little like
Sugar Ray Leonard.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.516
A little? Come on.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.379
Well, you still shouldn't
have said it.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.747
You think Morgan thinks
I have a racial bias?

03:41.921 --> 03:43.388
Maybe.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.080
Boy, that is so unfair.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.886
I would've marched on Selma
if it was in Long Island.

03:48.061 --> 03:52.122
-You'd have marched on Great Neck?
-Absolutely. I still might.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.994
I always hated those girls.
They would never date me.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.493
-Hey.
-Hey, there you are.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.103
-So you ready?
-For what?

03:59.272 --> 04:01.570
He's taking me to the airport.
We got a few minutes.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.003
Oh, yeah.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.609
What, you got no luggage?

04:04.777 --> 04:06.972
This is it.
I'm only going for the day.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.876
-I just gotta pick up a toothbrush.
-Okay.

04:10.049 --> 04:12.847
Hey, Kramer.
Who does that look like?

04:15.521 --> 04:17.785
-I don't know.
-Come on, come on.

04:17.957 --> 04:22.257
-Not salt, but...?
-What, Pepper Johnson?

04:22.695 --> 04:24.822
No. Sugar Ray Leonard.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.466
Oh, no way.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.065
All right, I'll tell you what.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.100
I'll bet you the next
three people I ask...

04:31.271 --> 04:33.262
...two of them will say Sugar Ray.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.339
How much? $100? $200? $1000?

04:35.508 --> 04:37.499
Wait, what are you doing?
You're not betting.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.578
-You know he's not supposed to bet.
-Come on, Jerry, it's a lock.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.738
Kramer, you've had this thing
under control...

04:42.915 --> 04:45.145
...for almost three years now.
Don't start again.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.446
-But it's a lock, Jerry.
-No.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.456
-What're you doing about Morgan?
-You know what would be great?

04:54.627 --> 04:56.788
If he could see me with
some of my black friends.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.022
Except you don't really
have any black friends.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.666
Outside of us, you don't
have any white friends either.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.565
-<i>Yes?</i>
-Hello, Joe?

05:07.740 --> 05:09.173
-Who is this?
-<i>It's me.</i>

05:09.809 --> 05:12.300
-George Costanza.
-Who?

05:12.478 --> 05:14.708
Remember I was here a while back?

05:14.881 --> 05:16.872
We watched
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> together?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.142
What do you want?

05:18.584 --> 05:20.814
Well, I've rented another video, Joe.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.614
And there's some popcorn.

05:22.789 --> 05:26.020
-I thought we could do it again.
-<i>Go away.</i>

05:26.292 --> 05:28.658
Remy. Hi.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.353
You. What are you doing here?

05:31.531 --> 05:33.328
Well, I got another
Audrey Hepburn movie.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.229
-<i>Remy, is that you?</i>
-Daddy, that man's here again.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.996
Remy, I want you up here instantly.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.608
You know, Remy, I was thinking.
Last time we were together, you--

05:44.000 --> 05:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:51.451 --> 05:52.509
That's great.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.415
You know what? Leave it.
Just pull the car around front.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.283
-You sure?
-Yeah. I'll take care of it.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.925
Just throw that in there, would you?

06:04.230 --> 06:05.458
Excuse me.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.691
I take heart medication. What would
you recommend for a runny nose?

06:08.868 --> 06:10.859
Take an antihistamine.
They're over there.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.062
-It's all right to take?
-Yeah, they're great.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.374
What about appetite suppressants?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.031
I just saw them.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.337
Oh, here. Here you go.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.413
-Thank you, young man.
-Have a good day, sir.

06:24.283 --> 06:27.741
-This is your swanky Diplomat's Club.
-I don't see Katie anywhere.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.554
What's this, a fellow club member?

06:30.723 --> 06:33.521
No, she's this woman who's
booking me on these college tours.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.355
She thinks I'm some big celebrity
that has to be pampered...

06:36.529 --> 06:38.121
...and explained every little thing.

06:38.297 --> 06:41.562
Yeah. I'm gonna get some snacks
before my flight.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.295
-Jerry.
-Oh, hi, Katie.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.441
-You found the airport all right?
-Yes, I followed the planes.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.702
I see you're having coffee.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.073
Just so you know,
they also have decaf as well.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.580
And I talked to the hostess, they'll also
be serving coffee on the plane...

06:57.750 --> 07:00.082
...along with a selection
of cocktails and soft--

07:00.253 --> 07:02.517
Thanks. Thanks for telling me.

07:06.526 --> 07:07.515
What's going on?

07:07.693 --> 07:09.854
I'm Lenore Walker,
Mr. Pitt's estate lawyer.

07:10.029 --> 07:13.795
I arrived to discuss his will and found
Justin had collapsed on the floor.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.058
Oh, my God.

07:15.234 --> 07:18.067
-Who are you?
-This is the girl I want to put in my will.

07:18.237 --> 07:21.434
-Elaine, l--
-Please. Rest, Mr. Pitt.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.438
Oh, you're the assistant.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.543
Why weren't you here
taking care of him?

07:26.312 --> 07:31.306
Well, he gave me the morning off.
I was doing a little shopping.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.616
How did this happen?

07:33.953 --> 07:37.184
He took a very dangerous combination
of prescription heart medicine...

07:37.356 --> 07:38.948
...and these other pills.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.183
You were supposed
to talk to the pharmacist.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.988
I spoke to somebody
who worked there.

07:44.163 --> 07:47.132
Oh, I'm gonna go
and call that pharmacy.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.461
How well do you know her?

07:53.272 --> 07:55.263
Jerry, just so you know,
before we take off...

07:55.441 --> 07:57.636
...they'll tell us what to do
in event of a crash.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.037
Yes, I know. I've flown before.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.443
Oh, good. I just didn't
want you to freak out.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.276
The chance of a crash is very slim.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.010
-Do you have to go to the bathroom?
-No.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.323
Even if you have to go a little,
you better go now...

08:13.493 --> 08:15.393
...because you can't until
after takeoff.

08:20.266 --> 08:23.235
-Hey, how you doing?
-Pretty good.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.661
Name's Kramer.

08:25.538 --> 08:28.302
Earl Haffler. Nice to meet you.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.237
I'm headed to Houston.
Where you headed?

08:30.710 --> 08:32.041
Oh, I'm happy right here.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.706
Isn't this place amazing?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.712
Planes flying in
from all corners of the world...

08:36.883 --> 08:39.317
...and they know the minute
when they're arriving.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.919
Oh, they don't know a darn thing.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.283
That's why my flight to Houston
has been delayed.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.118
They're all morons.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.385
Matter of fact, I'll bet you...

08:48.561 --> 08:51.962
...that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off
before my flight to Houston.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.155
Bet?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.691
-Not a betting man.
-Friendly wager.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.269
-I haven't made a bet in three years.
-Oh, come on.

08:59.438 --> 09:01.599
Keep things interesting,
pass the time.

09:05.244 --> 09:07.303
-Okay, how much?
-How about 200.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.573
You're on, cowboy.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.114
-How you doing?
-Okay.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.284
-Nice day today.
-What?

09:20.459 --> 09:23.553
I'm George, George Costanza.
You live around here?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.928
<i>Now arriving at gate 12...</i>

09:30.102 --> 09:32.832
-This could be Mexico City.
-Come on, Seattle, let's go.

09:33.005 --> 09:36.441
-Come on, Mexico City!
-Seattle! Seattle!

09:36.609 --> 09:39.339
<i>Flight number 42 from Mexico City.</i>

09:40.680 --> 09:41.942
Yeah, buddy.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.847
All right, come on, let's go again.
Let's go again.

09:47.219 --> 09:49.346
Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?

09:49.522 --> 09:51.114
No.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.485
You need to sit up.
Why don't I get you a pillow.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.184
Okay.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.444
It's a pretty full house,
lighting guy's name is Lou.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.378
-He's got a birthday next week.
-Yeah, I don't care.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.484
By the way, I don't want you
to freak out...

10:19.652 --> 10:21.779
...but the pilot is going to be
in the audience.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.312
Who?

10:23.489 --> 10:24.922
Remember the plane we took here?

10:25.091 --> 10:27.855
The pilot is going to be
sitting out there watching the show.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.552
I don't care.
Why are you telling me this?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.527
I just didn't want you to freak out.

10:32.698 --> 10:35.166
Why would I freak out?

10:36.435 --> 10:37.527
Pilot.

10:37.703 --> 10:42.538
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,
a big hand for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

10:45.645 --> 10:46.873
Hey!

10:47.046 --> 10:50.482
All right. Good afternoon, lthaca.
Welcome.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.014
Good to see you here.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.653
Boy, I noticed there's a lot
of those orange cones...

10:55.821 --> 10:57.755
...you have out on the thruway
on the way...

10:59.225 --> 11:00.749
...up here.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.662
I was-- l--

11:20.112 --> 11:23.172
-It didn't go very well, did it?
-No, it didn't.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.407
And you know why?

11:24.583 --> 11:27.381
Seeing that pilot in the audience
really freaked me out.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.713
I knew it.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.914
If you hadn't mentioned anything,
I would've been fine.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.524
I became obsessed with him.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.285
Why did I invite him?
Stupid. Stupid.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.520
When he asked for tickets,
I should've said no.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.564
-I'm gonna go chew him out.
-Oh, it doesn't matter now.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.634
-Don't you worry, I'm on top of this.
-Yeah, you're on top of it.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.703
And I'm on the bottom!

11:48.941 --> 11:53.037
Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like
you're in the hole $3200.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.009
Will that be cash or check?

11:55.181 --> 11:57.479
Come on, one more bet.
Double or nothing, huh?

11:58.918 --> 12:00.146
All right.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.219
But I wanna see
some cash on the table.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.889
All right, let me call my bank, huh?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.820
All right, you stay here.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.432
-Hello?
-Yeah, it's me.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.298
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

12:19.505 --> 12:21.132
All right, listen,
I need some cash.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.298
-What for?
-I just need it, that's all.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.070
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.770
You're gambling again, aren't you?

12:28.948 --> 12:31.439
You weak, weak man.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.915
-<i>Where are you?</i>
-I'm at the airport.

12:34.086 --> 12:37.146
-The airport?
-<i>Betting on arrivals and departures.</i>

12:37.323 --> 12:39.814
But I'm down 3200 bucks,
so you gotta get me some cash.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.483
-I don't have that kind of dough.
-<i>Sure you do.</i>

12:42.661 --> 12:44.526
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not the bag.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.324
Help me, man. I'm desperate.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.100
All right, all right.

12:50.569 --> 12:51.900
<i>Sorry for the delay, folks.</i>

12:52.071 --> 12:55.097
<i>There is a slight complication,
but we're taking care of it...</i>

12:55.274 --> 12:57.242
<i>...and we'll be on our way
to LaGuardia.</i>

12:57.409 --> 12:58.637
What is the complication?

13:00.980 --> 13:02.379
-Mr. Seinfeld?
-Yes?

13:02.548 --> 13:05.711
I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked
that you leave this plane.

13:06.886 --> 13:07.875
What?

13:08.053 --> 13:10.851
Apparently he has
some sort of problem with you.

13:11.056 --> 13:14.719
I'm not surprised.
I really let him have it, Jerry.

13:14.894 --> 13:18.057
He had no business being in your
audience if you didn't want him there.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.492
I didn't care.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.964
Well, now the pilot doesn't
want you on his plane.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.830
He can't just throw me
off the plane.

13:25.004 --> 13:28.906
Yes, he can, if he has cause to believe
that a passenger will be a disturbance.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.042
But I'm not a disturbance.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.701
Well, apparently you are
disturbing him, sir.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.870
But someone is waiting for me.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.573
-Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
-I'm freaking out!

13:38.751 --> 13:41.242
I am freaking out!

13:48.360 --> 13:51.659
There's a flight leaving at 8
and another one leaving at 8:30.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.093
Which one do you want?

13:54.767 --> 13:56.428
Which one do you think I want?

13:57.903 --> 14:01.566
-The 8 will get you in a little earlier.
-Then we'll make it the 8.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.470
Okay, I'll book a hotel.
A standard room or a mini-suite?

14:04.643 --> 14:06.406
-Hotel?
-Yeah, it's 8 in the morning.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.308
No, no, I have to get home tonight.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.280
Bridgette's gonna be waiting for me
at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.181
Midsize, luxury or sports model?
What's your preference?

14:19.325 --> 14:24.194
I don't have a preference, okay?
Just make a decision yourself.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.560
All right? Stop bothering me
with every minor detail.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.257
Please?

14:29.735 --> 14:33.933
Okay. You're the big celebrity.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.237
-Hello?
-<i>George.</i>

14:41.413 --> 14:43.813
-Hey, Jerry. How was lthaca?
-<i>I'm still here.</i>

14:43.983 --> 14:46.042
You gotta go down
to the Diplomat's Club--

14:46.218 --> 14:48.686
Hey, Jerry, what was the name
of that exterminator...

14:48.854 --> 14:51.186
...who fumigated your apartment
when you had fleas?

14:51.357 --> 14:54.190
-<i>Karl, I think.</i>
-Karl. Yeah, yeah.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.328
-He was a nice guy.
-Yeah, he was nice.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.963
-What company was it?
-<i>Defend.</i>

14:59.131 --> 15:01.326
Defend. Yeah.
You know, we spoke for a little bit.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.162
-You need an exterminator?
-No, not really.

15:04.336 --> 15:05.735
Oh, don't tell me.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.738
-<i>Because he's black?</i>
-Gotta go.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.172
George? George?

15:11.877 --> 15:14.107
<i>Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
Is Elaine there?</i>

15:14.280 --> 15:15.804
Hold on.

15:19.418 --> 15:23.115
Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld
on the phone for you.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.350
-Hello?
-<i>Elaine. I need a big favor.</i>

15:27.526 --> 15:31.121
Go down to the Diplomat's Club
and meet Bridgette for me. I'm late.

15:31.297 --> 15:32.958
-That's at the airport, right?
-<i>Right.</i>

15:33.132 --> 15:36.158
She'll think I stood her up.
I'll never get another date with her.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.132
-She'll freak out!
-All right, all right.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.762
-You sound a little freaked out yourself.
-I am a little freaked out!

15:41.941 --> 15:43.568
Calm down. I'll take care of it.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.836
-<i>All right, but you have to leave now!</i>
-I said, I'll take care of it.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.744
-Kramer.
-Hey.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.480
-Okay, here it is.
-All right, good.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.853
Here's my collateral.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.124
So it's a mailbag. So what?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.523
So what?

16:04.697 --> 16:07.131
Do you know whose
mailbag that is?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.831
David Berkowitz.

16:10.035 --> 16:11.366
Son of Sam.

16:11.537 --> 16:15.029
The worst mass murderer
the post office ever produced.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.267
-Where'd you get this?
-I took over his route.

16:18.444 --> 16:21.436
And, boy, were there a lot
of dogs on that route.

16:22.481 --> 16:26.611
-Any of them talking to you?
-Just to tell me to keep off the snacks.

16:30.689 --> 16:35.092
-Your bud is a hell of a guy.
-Yeah, don't I know it.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.660
Okay, Cosmo,
we're back in business.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.819
Yeah.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.229
Let's check out the board.
Now, who do you like?

16:42.401 --> 16:44.369
All right, how about lthaca
versus Boston?

16:44.970 --> 16:48.838
All right. I'm gonna give you
a sporting chance. I'll take lthaca.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.067
-Double or nothing.
-Double or nothing.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.074
I hope you know what you're doing.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.787
-Where are we?
-I'm not sure.

17:06.492 --> 17:10.428
-Is this even a road?
-Oh, we lost the road half-hour ago.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.257
What? Well, why didn't you
wake me up?

17:12.431 --> 17:14.865
You told me not to bother you
with minor details.

17:15.034 --> 17:19.630
-No road is a major detail.
-Okay, now I know.

17:19.805 --> 17:22.501
Should I keep going or turn around?
Do you have a preference?

17:22.674 --> 17:24.608
Look out!

17:29.515 --> 17:31.881
-May I help you?
-I'm the exterminator.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.519
Oh, yes, of course. Come in.

17:34.686 --> 17:37.519
Why didn't you want me to bring
my equipment or wear my uniform?

17:38.257 --> 17:41.920
Well, if the other people in the office
saw that I had called an exterminator...

17:42.094 --> 17:43.686
...they would just panic.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.761
They're a jittery group.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.058
Besides, this is sort of
a friendly visit.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.497
-Karl, right?
-Do I know you?

17:50.669 --> 17:52.660
Yeah. We met at
Jerry Seinfeld's apartment...

17:52.838 --> 17:55.102
...when you fumigated for fleas
over there.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.607
Seinfeld. Oh, yeah.
Funny white guy, right?

17:59.278 --> 18:00.939
Jerry?

18:01.547 --> 18:05.244
Yes, I suppose he is white.
I never really thought about it.

18:05.651 --> 18:09.678
I don't really see people
in terms of color.

18:10.722 --> 18:14.488
You know, there's someone I'd like
you to meet. Hang on a second.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.993
-Is Mr. Morgan in?
-<i>Mr. Morgan left for dinner.</i>

18:18.163 --> 18:19.926
He left?

18:22.334 --> 18:24.234
Karl, you hungry?

18:26.872 --> 18:28.840
<i>Here's a new twist on car-pooling:</i>

18:29.007 --> 18:29.996
<i>Early this morning...</i>

18:30.175 --> 18:32.973
<i>...a lost Manhattanite drove through
a residential back yard...</i>

18:33.145 --> 18:35.705
<i>...and wound up in a swimming pool
near Ithaca, New York.</i>

18:35.881 --> 18:37.940
<i>Comedian Jerry Seinfeld,
a passenger...</i>

18:38.117 --> 18:39.846
<i>...seemed a little freaked out.</i>

18:40.018 --> 18:43.385
<i>That's it! No more questions!
I don't care!</i>

18:43.555 --> 18:46.023
<i>No! No! No!</i>

18:46.191 --> 18:49.957
That's him. That's the man who
gave me the pills in the drugstore.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.619
He's no pharmacist.

18:51.997 --> 18:55.296
Seinfeld? I know that name.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.459
He called here earlier for Elaine.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.146
Oh, by the way, order anything
you want, it's all on me.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.213
Just do me a tiny favor.

19:11.383 --> 19:12.816
Pretend we're old friends.

19:14.019 --> 19:18.183
Oh, my God, Mr. Morgan.
What a coincidence.

19:18.357 --> 19:19.756
It's Mr. Morgan. Come here.

19:19.925 --> 19:24.055
Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet
a dear old friend of mine, Karl.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.129
I'm the exterminator.

19:26.465 --> 19:30.765
That's what we used to call him in
high school, "The Exterminator."

19:30.936 --> 19:32.995
He was a linebacker. Oh, boy.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.903
Oh, did we have some wild times.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.978
Well, that Newman
was your good-luck charm.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.775
-Yeah, he sure was.
-I should've quit at double or nothing.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.680
-Traveler's checks acceptable?
-Oh, I accept.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.413
Yeah, he worked in the cubicle
right next to me.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.250
We once double-dated.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.220
Yeah.

19:55.394 --> 19:58.591
It's a pleasure doing business
with a gentleman like yourself.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.466
-Kramer.
-Elaine, what are you doing here?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.499
Jerry asked me
to meet his girlfriend here.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.297
You hear about his plane in lthaca?

20:06.471 --> 20:07.938
What about the plane in lthaca?

20:08.106 --> 20:11.701
Our stupid friend
freaked out the pilot...

20:11.877 --> 20:14.243
...single-handedly delayed
the plane a whole hour.

20:14.413 --> 20:15.971
-Can you believe that?
-Boy.

20:16.148 --> 20:19.140
Your friend caused the delay?

20:19.318 --> 20:21.616
-You're a cheat.
-No, wait--

20:21.787 --> 20:25.553
-Nobody hustles Earl Haffler.
-Oh, come on.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.557
-See you around, Cosmo.
-What?

20:28.727 --> 20:29.819
Howdy, ma'am.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.601
Poison you?

20:36.935 --> 20:38.926
Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you?

20:39.137 --> 20:42.334
What? What?
Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious?

20:42.507 --> 20:44.168
He's never even met you.

20:44.343 --> 20:47.744
You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.740
Goodbye?

21:21.913 --> 21:23.642
-Bridgette.
-Jerry, what happened?

21:24.750 --> 21:27.014
I'm so sorry.
I got stuck out of town.

21:27.185 --> 21:28.652
I missed our whole time together.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.311
Well, my plane doesn't leave
for another half-hour.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.479
Really?

21:45.604 --> 21:47.071
Oh, my God. It's him.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.672
It's the pilot!

22:07.626 --> 22:10.561
I love this place. You know,
Karl and I come here all the time.

22:10.729 --> 22:13.459
-Is that right?
-Yeah, I come here all the time.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.430
You wouldn't believe
the rat droppings in the kitchen.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.903
So you really are an exterminator?

22:20.038 --> 22:22.836
This time, George,
you've sunk to a new low.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.403
Check, please.

22:28.714 --> 22:32.411
Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard
can eat here on the house.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.074
Hear that? Hear that? Mr. Morgan!

22:34.252 --> 22:36.413
Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
