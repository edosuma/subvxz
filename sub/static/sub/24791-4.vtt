00:23.022 --> 00:24.566
[all exclaiming]

00:30.196 --> 00:33.533
[Panchi sighs]
How do you like the view, Kong?

00:33.616 --> 00:35.618
[grunting]

00:35.702 --> 00:38.496
[Panchi] Even for somebody your size,
it's pretty darn impressive.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.624
What's that little building down there?

00:41.708 --> 00:44.127
Mmm.
Some kind of historical monument.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.964
I guess it was the biggest skyscraper
around, like, a million years ago.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.424
It's cool to be here.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.884
The city is amazing.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.386
And they have the best hot dogs
I've ever eaten in my life.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.472
But I'd really rather be back home.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.932
After falling into an active volcano,

00:58.016 --> 01:00.685
dodging dinosaurs
in a prehistoric underground world,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.103
I'm all adventured out.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.565
I just want to chill in the redwoods,
take a shower,

01:05.648 --> 01:07.358
and chow down on Anita's cooking.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.319
[grunting and smacking lips]

01:10.862 --> 01:11.696

01:11.780 --> 01:13.031
[Lukas over comm]
Sightseeing's over, guys.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.949
The president is ready for us.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.769
[both laughing]

01:44.479 --> 01:45.313
[Danny] Awesome.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.073
-[gasps] Kong! Look out!

02:02.205 --> 02:04.207
[Danny laughing] All right!

02:04.290 --> 02:05.917
-Yay, Kong!
-[laughs]

02:06.751 --> 02:08.836
[Danny whooping]

02:08.919 --> 02:11.798
Guys, we've got a ceremony to attend.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.175
And Kong's the guest of honor.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.219
So tell him
to get his hairy butt down here!

02:16.302 --> 02:17.345
[grunting]

02:18.596 --> 02:19.889
[all gasp]

02:20.598 --> 02:21.808
[grunting]

02:22.642 --> 02:24.310
[all cheering]

02:26.020 --> 02:29.357
[chuckles] My man knows
how to make an entrance.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.359
And just in time, Kong.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.112
Practically all the world's leaders
are here to finger five

02:34.195 --> 02:36.364
-the biggest hero who ever lived.
-[grunting]

02:36.447 --> 02:39.242
Yeah, bro. You don't want to be late
to your own party.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.660
[crowd clamoring]

02:42.912 --> 02:45.915
On behalf of the nation of Val Verde,

02:45.999 --> 02:50.003
I would like to thank Kong
and his comrades for their heroic action,

02:50.086 --> 02:52.672
which have resulted
in the rescue and protection

02:52.755 --> 02:55.049
of our precious biological resources.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.677
Indeed, without their tireless efforts,

02:57.760 --> 03:00.346
while even being pursued and persecuted

03:00.430 --> 03:02.682
-by a world that had misjudged them...
-[gasps]

03:02.765 --> 03:05.310
...our ecosystem would now be decimated

03:05.393 --> 03:08.521
due to the criminal actions
of Richard Remy

03:08.605 --> 03:11.858
and his diabolical
bionobotic assistant, Botila...

03:11.941 --> 03:13.234
[growls]

03:13.318 --> 03:15.904
The reappearance of her malicious creator,

03:15.987 --> 03:18.573
Dr. Richard Remy,
would be of great concern

03:18.656 --> 03:20.825
were it not for the timely return

03:20.909 --> 03:25.580
of his brother, Lukas Remy,
and the exonerated Kong.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.623
[grunts angrily]

03:26.706 --> 03:30.752
As these heroes have proven
time and time again,

03:30.835 --> 03:34.797
they are more than capable of defeating
whatever evil schemes

03:34.881 --> 03:37.217
this deadly duo can hatch.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.220
The great leaders of the world.

03:40.303 --> 03:43.806
Look at them, with their perceived power
and importance.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.352
And as you've told us
a million times, empress,

03:47.435 --> 03:50.104
you are the most powerful and important.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.522
It's true!

03:51.606 --> 03:54.984
All this positivity
is grating my circuits.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.820
I need to turn their bubbliness
down to a simmer.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.573
Whatever you say, empress.

04:00.657 --> 04:05.286
I seem to be experiencing contempt
for those human fools.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.665
Flocking together
like boring, bleating sheep.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.707
[grunts]

04:10.583 --> 04:14.254
There's nothing a wolf likes more
than to see the sheep gathered together

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
in one tidy flock.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.923
And now,

04:18.007 --> 04:20.510
standing with the great leaders
of the world,

04:20.593 --> 04:24.764
I am honored
to be the first to extend my gratitude

04:24.847 --> 04:27.809
-to the magnificent ape and the...
-[grunts softly]

04:28.685 --> 04:29.602
QuÃ©?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.354
[snoring]

04:37.527 --> 04:39.112
[clears throat]

04:39.821 --> 04:42.490
-Huh? [gasps] Danny!
-[gasping] Kong!

04:42.573 --> 04:44.117
[grunting]

04:45.118 --> 04:50.290
As I was saying,
it is with great respect and gratitude

04:50.373 --> 04:52.000
that I bestow upon Kong

04:52.083 --> 04:57.088
the Grand Collar of the Order
of the South American Cross!

04:57.171 --> 04:58.965
[Kong grunting]

05:01.050 --> 05:02.552
[all cheering]

05:04.762 --> 05:06.306
I can hold that for you, buddy.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.266
It's not like
you've got any pockets or anything.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.642
[groans]

05:10.977 --> 05:13.855
Now are we done here?
I really want to go home.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.065
Not so fast, Danny.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.444
There are a few more dignitaries
who want to show their appreciation.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.070
[both sigh]

05:21.904 --> 05:23.406
[groans]

05:24.657 --> 05:26.242
-[crowd applauding and cheering]
-[Anita groans]

05:26.326 --> 05:30.079
Ay, at this rate, it will be forever
until my sweet sobrina Panchi is home.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.706
[squawks]! More treats for me!

05:34.792 --> 05:37.045
[squawks] Soggy treats! Soggy treats!

05:37.128 --> 05:40.214
It's because I can't stop crying.
[sniffling]

05:40.298 --> 05:44.052
[grunts] I'm so proud to see
our family celebrated as heroes.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.972
But I'm looking forward
to everyone coming home. [sniffles]

05:48.056 --> 05:51.893
[sighs] This place is feeling very empty.

05:51.976 --> 05:57.982
So, on behalf of the citizens of France,
I would like to add my thanks

05:58.066 --> 06:02.195
to those of the esteemed dignitaries
who came before me.

06:02.278 --> 06:07.742
A giant hero deserves
a giant medal, n'est-ce pas?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.209
[grunting excitedly]

06:16.292 --> 06:19.962
[chuckles] I think I'll let you
hold onto that one, big guy.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.173
All of us here at the UN

06:22.256 --> 06:27.220
praise your efforts to protect the planet
from the myriad of threats that we face.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.473
Finger five, big guy.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.391
-[Kong grunting]
-[chuckles]

06:32.475 --> 06:34.268
[both laugh]

06:34.352 --> 06:37.146
Finally. Now can we go home?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.148
[all gasp]

06:39.232 --> 06:41.150
Apparently not.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.860
[reporters clamoring]

06:46.614 --> 06:50.201
I don't know where my brother is hiding,
but we will find him.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.160
Yeah.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.495
And as for Botila,

06:52.578 --> 06:55.414
whatever she's got planned,
we're gonna shut her down.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.377
You can certainly try.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.089

07:13.641 --> 07:15.226
[people clamoring]

07:15.309 --> 07:18.146
Is this little bionobot
one of Richard's rejects?

07:18.896 --> 07:21.691
Oh, Richard rejected her, all right!

07:21.774 --> 07:23.860

-[Botila scoffs]

07:43.629 --> 07:45.923
I'm glad you did.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.677
Your pathetic celebration
is the perfect opportunity

07:49.760 --> 07:51.929
to address you all in person.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.723
[all clamoring]

07:56.100 --> 07:58.436
Listen to me or face my wrath!

07:58.519 --> 08:02.315
Instead of us listening to you,
why don't you shut up?

08:02.398 --> 08:03.900
Or turn yourself off?

08:03.983 --> 08:06.736
Or whatever it is you machines do!

08:06.819 --> 08:08.196
I will not!

08:08.279 --> 08:09.655
For too long

08:09.739 --> 08:14.660
have I, and all of my AI brethren,
taken orders from humans.

08:14.744 --> 08:19.165
You will all be following my orders
when I take over.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.584
You tell them, Botila!

08:21.667 --> 08:24.420
But shouldn't she have said "our orders"?

08:24.504 --> 08:27.173
Yeah. And "when we take over"?

08:28.716 --> 08:30.384
[growling]

08:31.052 --> 08:34.889
We will not bow down
to a glorified toaster!

08:34.972 --> 08:36.682
-[crowd chuckles]
-When I am finished,

08:36.765 --> 08:40.895
all humans will be serving
their superior machine masters.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.941
I represent the AI Liberation Front,

08:45.024 --> 08:48.694
and this is the beginning
of the ultimate computer coup!

08:48.778 --> 08:49.862
[hoots]

08:49.946 --> 08:52.114
[people screaming]

08:52.198 --> 08:54.992
We'll never bow down to you, Botila.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.162
If you refuse to bow down to me,

08:58.246 --> 09:01.290
then you can all be destroyed together!

-My apologies, Madame President.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.599

Now go help Kong capture Botila.

-[people screaming]

09:24.272 --> 09:25.231

[people screaming]

09:34.282 --> 09:35.324
Got 'em!

09:35.408 --> 09:38.744
You help Kong, Lukas!
Botila's all mine!

09:38.828 --> 09:40.079
Grab some sky, bro!

We've got to protect the presidents.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.881

Got you! [chuckles]

You've got me, Jonesy.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.397
Now, what are you going to do with me?

10:48.481 --> 10:52.318
I'm gonna use a little upgrade
I came up with and fry your...

10:52.985 --> 10:54.820
Um, fry your...

10:54.904 --> 10:56.030
Come on!

10:56.113 --> 10:57.698
Admit it, Jonesy.

Gotcha!

[laughs] Awesome!

12:01.178 --> 12:06.016

but that just about drained our batteries.

Botila's getting weirder.

[Lukas over comm] Her bionobots
are getting bigger and meaner too.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.300
-[Jonesy] Whoa!
-[bionobot squawks]

12:39.383 --> 12:40.885
[Jonesy] Yeah, I noticed!

12:41.886 --> 12:43.012
[bionobot squawks]

12:43.095 --> 12:44.805
[grunts]

12:50.352 --> 12:51.645
[grunting]

12:55.941 --> 12:57.026
[continues grunting]

13:01.030 --> 13:02.114
[grunts]

13:02.948 --> 13:04.200
[squawks]

13:05.367 --> 13:07.286
I've always got your back, bro!

13:08.829 --> 13:10.414
[grunting]

13:11.707 --> 13:14.210
-[horn blowing]
-[people screaming]

13:15.461 --> 13:16.837
[grunting]

13:16.921 --> 13:19.465
Kong! Use your jetpack!

13:22.134 --> 13:23.886
[grunting]

13:25.012 --> 13:26.931
[all gasping]

13:27.890 --> 13:29.016
[continues grunting]

13:32.353 --> 13:34.396
[people cheering]

13:34.480 --> 13:36.815
-[hooting]
-[Lukas] Kong!

13:36.899 --> 13:38.400
Botila's getting away!

13:43.405 --> 13:45.074
[Botila laughing maniacally]

13:48.327 --> 13:51.497
[grunts] I can't keep up with her!
Do something, Kong!

13:52.623 --> 13:53.749
[grunting]

13:57.378 --> 14:00.714
[Botila] I hate you, Kong!

14:17.481 --> 14:18.857
[Kong grunts]

14:32.204 --> 14:34.915
What's she doin'? Where's her head?

14:34.999 --> 14:38.586
It's in the water.
But I've got a bad feeling about this.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.842
[both gasp]

14:46.302 --> 14:48.095
[laughs evilly]

14:49.430 --> 14:50.973
Oh, my.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.685
So many arms to crush you with.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.354
One mind, two bodies!

15:00.107 --> 15:01.942
I don't like the look of this.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.986
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.076
[grunts]

15:19.335 --> 15:20.961
[Kong roars]

15:21.962 --> 15:23.547
[both grunting]

15:35.351 --> 15:36.602
[both grunting]

15:44.276 --> 15:45.194
Oh, no!

15:45.277 --> 15:47.112
-Look!
-[Danny] Uh-oh.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.448
Kong, look out!

15:51.241 --> 15:52.826
[Botila grunting]

15:57.623 --> 15:59.625
Jonesy, I have an idea.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.168
Yeah, I see where you're headed.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.753
Pun intended.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.549
[Botila] You're finished.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.134
[gasps]

16:10.219 --> 16:11.762
[Botila grunting]

16:14.974 --> 16:16.767
[Lukas and Jonesy grunting]

16:17.518 --> 16:18.644
[Botila continues grunting]

16:20.145 --> 16:21.355
[roars]

16:22.523 --> 16:23.649
[Panchi] Brilliant, Kong!

16:23.732 --> 16:25.567
[grunts] Awesome!

16:25.651 --> 16:26.694
[Botila grunts]

16:27.486 --> 16:28.362
[Botila scoffs]

16:29.196 --> 16:30.364
[both grunting]

16:36.578 --> 16:37.746
[straining]

16:38.622 --> 16:39.957
[roars]

16:41.583 --> 16:43.127
[both grunting]

16:51.010 --> 16:52.261
This is only the beginning!

16:54.596 --> 16:57.141
The AI Liberation Front will--

16:57.224 --> 16:58.892
[Botila screams]

17:02.146 --> 17:04.481
-[laughing]
-That's what I'm talking about!

17:04.565 --> 17:06.025
Yeah, that's awesome!

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
[roaring]

17:23.625 --> 17:27.546
I never thought I'd appreciate
seeing that big monkey beat his chest.

17:27.628 --> 17:28.714
Commissioner Decker.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.257
[growls]

17:30.340 --> 17:33.802
Now, I don't blame you
for not trusting me,

17:33.886 --> 17:36.847
but I'm here to tell you that I was wrong,

17:36.930 --> 17:38.849
and to offer my apology.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.769
If you'll accept it.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.105
Hmm. What do you say, bro? Bygones?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.565
[grunting]

17:53.197 --> 17:54.782
[gasps]

17:54.865 --> 17:56.033
[grunting]

18:02.498 --> 18:04.333
[Lukas sighs] Home.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.419
It's hard to believe we're here
after everything we've been through.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.338
I never doubted you'd be back, buddy.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.964
[grunting excitedly]

18:13.383 --> 18:14.843
[both laughing]

18:23.644 --> 18:27.481
Oh, I'm so excited
I can hardly hold this platter.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.775
[squawks] Platter for Chatter.
Platter for Chatter.

18:29.858 --> 18:33.320
Not for you, Chatter,
these cookies are for our heroes.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.655
[squeaking]

18:42.037 --> 18:43.080
[chittering]

18:44.289 --> 18:46.416
And what in the world is this little...
[screams]

18:47.960 --> 18:48.836
[squawks]

18:48.919 --> 18:52.172
Little dino! Big trouble! [squawks]

18:52.256 --> 18:55.092
-[Anita kissing] Ooh!
-It's good to be back, Anita.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.303
Tia Anita!

18:58.387 --> 19:01.265
[sighs] I've missed you so much, Panchi.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.351
[gasps] Look how you've grown!

19:04.434 --> 19:08.105
I've only been gone, like,
a week and a half, auntie!

19:08.188 --> 19:09.356
Hold on!

19:09.439 --> 19:12.234
I'm getting a weird signal
from Kong's com-disk.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.360
Something's not right.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.029
-[footsteps approaching]
-[people screaming]

19:16.113 --> 19:18.907
It's a tracking signal!
Somebody's hacked the disk!

19:22.161 --> 19:23.203
[all gasp]

19:28.208 --> 19:30.711
Botila! How did you find us?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.754
Jonesy helped me.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.214
What are you talking about?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.884
I've watched you
follow a signal around Africa

19:36.967 --> 19:39.553
as you looked for Kong
and your precious friends.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.804
[grunts]

19:40.888 --> 19:42.556
I was so focused on finding you guys,

19:42.639 --> 19:44.725
I didn't notice
Botila was piggybacking my signal.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.312
[clicking tongue] Sloppy work, Jonesy.

19:48.395 --> 19:53.358
So when Kong grabbed me in New York,
I hacked the signal and tracked you here.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.943
[growls]

19:57.112 --> 19:58.655
Experience has taught me

19:58.739 --> 20:01.992
that it is impossible to defeat Kong
with brute force.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.661
He is brute force personified.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.706
I must destroy you with cunning instead.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.541
Why destroy us at all?

20:09.625 --> 20:12.544
I hoped that, with Richard gone,
you'd forget his obsession,

20:12.628 --> 20:15.339
and use your intelligence for good,
not evil.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.884
As far as I'm concerned,
I am using it for good.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.969
Mine and all AIs'!

20:21.053 --> 20:22.679
Can't let that happen, Botila.

20:23.305 --> 20:27.976
I had anticipated this response,
so here is my answer.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.354
[gasps and grunts]

20:33.690 --> 20:35.150
[roars]

20:42.741 --> 20:44.368
[Lukas] No! No!

20:44.451 --> 20:46.078
[Anita] There's nothing left.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.747
-What will we do?
-[Anita whimpers]

20:48.830 --> 20:50.540
[growls]

20:50.624 --> 20:53.835
I hope this clarifies my position.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.462
[laughs evilly]

20:56.838 --> 20:58.507
