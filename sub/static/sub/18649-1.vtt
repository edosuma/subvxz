- Yeah.
- Listen, uh, I want to talk to you about something.

04:48.990 --> 04:52.050

04:52.160 --> 04:54.321
- Yeah, yeah.
- Aziz, good morning. We can talk now.

04:54.428 --> 04:58.455

- Buddy.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.421
How'd the antiterrorist training go?

05:21.522 --> 05:25.481
Six weeks running around Fort Benning
in the rain. I wish I could do it all over again.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.493
Well, that can be arranged.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.688
- Tom.
- Good mornin', Pete.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.493

Can I get a cup of coffee before we-
What's happening at Camp David?

05:44.278 --> 05:47.042
Matt's getting closer with Ben-Itzak
on the East Jerusalem proposal...

05:47.148 --> 05:49.309
but it's gonna take your visit
to get him to agree.

05:49.417 --> 05:52.784
- What about Abu Jallal?
- If we can work out the water issues,
he'll support it.

05:52.887 --> 05:57.256
But again, we're not gonna get any firm
commitments until they have face time on Friday.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.816
I'll be there. I'm just not gonna hang around,
'cause it loses its effectiveness.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.889
Brass ones.
Which you don't have.

06:36.998 --> 06:40.229

<i>R\E9sum\E9s don't mean a lot to me,</i>
<i>and they mean absolutely nothing on the street.</i>

09:09.650 --> 09:12.346
Any other supportive advice
before we get to know each other?

09:12.453 --> 09:17.550
As a matter of fact, there is. If you want
a career here in P.I.D., you might want to...

09:17.658 --> 09:19.922
invest in some more
appropriate clothing.

09:20.027 --> 09:24.896
I was ordered to take you on. That's why
I'm here. You requested me as a T.A. Why?

09:27.835 --> 09:30.963
My field instructor at the Academy
said you're the best investigator we have.

09:31.072 --> 09:33.472
- Who is that?
- Pete Garrison.

09:35.109 --> 09:37.009

10:05.306 --> 10:07.604
What's the matter, Pete?
You see somebody on the watch list?

10:07.708 --> 10:11.610
- He just doesn't look right.
<i>- Security room, check out the top view.</i>

10:11.712 --> 10:14.044

- All right.

- Take your hands out of the jacket.

10:26.494 --> 10:29.691
- We're clear.
<i>- All right. Classic's coming out.</i>

10:29.797 --> 10:31.697

<i>- President Ballentine!</i>

11:02.263 --> 11:05.664

Nice to meet you.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.309
<i> All posts, all posts,</i>
<i>Classic and Cinci moving to hold.</i>

11:17.711 --> 11:21.010

Now, I want to introduce you to someone-

11:50.644 --> 11:53.044
<i>Chilton security to all posts. Classic wrapping up.</i>

11:53.147 --> 11:55.707
<i>My wife, Sarah.</i>

<i>Cincinnati leaving school for Serenity.</i>

<i>E. T.A. 1800 hours.</i>

12:08.062 --> 12:10.292
<i>How do you think</i>
<i>it went in there?</i>

12:10.397 --> 12:14.663
- Excuse me, ma'am, are you talking to me?
- Yes.

12:14.768 --> 12:18.033
I thought it was, uh,
an excellent speech.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.936
- One to 10?
- Ten, ma'am.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.941
You're not a very good liar, Pete.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.705
<i>- Seriously?</i>
- Yes. I- I really want to know.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.577
9.5.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.683
Excuse me.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.677
<i>Charlie?</i>

12:58.779 --> 13:02.340
Charlie. Charlie!
Oh, my God. Charlie.

13:02.449 --> 13:07.944
Somebody! Help! Charlie. Charlie.
Somebody help!

13:10.891 --> 13:15.123
<i>I just wanted to say hi.</i>
<i>I just want to let you know what's goin' on.</i>

13:15.229 --> 13:17.959
<i>I hate you.</i>

13:18.065 --> 13:22.058
<i>I saw you on the news. I got your message.</i>
<i>I know you want me to kill you.</i>

13:22.169 --> 13:25.229
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah. Sorry.

13:25.339 --> 13:30.504
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.

13:30.611 --> 13:35.139
And then there are the verbal threats.

13:35.249 --> 13:38.548
<i> He's a dead man.</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.</i>

13:38.652 --> 13:42.019
<i>He's ruinin' this country,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.</i>

13:42.122 --> 13:44.090
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.819
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?

13:49.196 --> 13:54.327
- No. But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?

13:54.435 --> 13:58.701
Well, he translated here-

13:58.806 --> 14:02.003
And that literally means "to put pressure
on him, he bit the guy."

14:02.109 --> 14:05.272
<i>As if he was being tortured.</i>
<i>But that's not what it means here.</i>

14:05.379 --> 14:08.109
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.115
He didn't bite him.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.549
Good.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.783
We need to talk.

14:22.029 --> 14:26.125
I think you have a little spinach
or something in your teeth.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.664
I want you to route all calls
through to my cell.

14:31.772 --> 14:34.639
You picked a hell of a day
to start your field work.

14:34.742 --> 14:38.303
- Button up your jacket.
- Why? What goin' on?

14:38.412 --> 14:42.075
<i>Dispatch, this is Charlie 9. Units on scene.</i>

14:42.182 --> 14:48.121
<i>- Here comes the Secret Service.</i>
- I really don't need them breathin' down my neck.

14:48.222 --> 14:50.213
What do they know
about investigatin' murder?

14:52.693 --> 14:54.888
She can breathe
down my neck.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.963
But not him.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.760
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.

14:59.867 --> 15:02.062
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.195
<i>The way I see it,</i>
<i>he hands over the wallet.</i>

15:33.300 --> 15:36.929
As the guy reaches for it,
Merriweather goes for his gun.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.369
<i>Bad guy shoots him first.</i>

15:40.841 --> 15:43.776
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.

15:43.877 --> 15:46.471
You know my problem
with gut feelings?

15:46.580 --> 15:49.174
Once you have them,
the only evidence you see...

15:49.283 --> 15:51.342
is the evidence that reinforces
your gut feeling.

15:51.452 --> 15:54.615
<i>- Human nature.</i>
- There's no money left in his wallet...

15:54.721 --> 15:57.554
and there's been a series of robberies here
the last two months.

15:57.658 --> 16:00.183
<i>You have some reason to think</i>
<i>it wasn't a robbery?</i>

16:00.294 --> 16:03.991
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years
honing his ability to sense danger...

16:04.097 --> 16:05.997
to notice anything
outside of the ordinary...

16:06.099 --> 16:10.058
so for some average street criminal to get
the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.

16:10.170 --> 16:14.368
Not to mention that he's been
shot here twice with a.45.

16:14.475 --> 16:19.503
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial
canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.

16:19.613 --> 16:22.741
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort
of thing happens all the time.

16:22.850 --> 16:25.580
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.

16:41.768 --> 16:45.067
Rosario.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.333
Anyone want anything
to eat or drink?

16:47.441 --> 16:50.672
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am. I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.

16:50.777 --> 16:55.043
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.446
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.

16:57.551 --> 17:00.179
You gonna make me change my mind?

17:00.287 --> 17:04.587
<i>Detective, take a look at the bullet mark</i>
<i>on the doorjamb. The slug didn't penetrate.</i>

17:04.691 --> 17:08.252
<i>It's cedar, which is a soft wood.</i>
<i>It gets brittle with age.</i>

17:08.362 --> 17:12.627
<i>- So what are you sayin'?</i>
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.

17:12.733 --> 17:15.031
And that's what slowed down
the velocity of the bullet...

17:15.135 --> 17:17.262
and stopped it
from penetrating the wood...

17:17.371 --> 17:22.809
which it easily would have done had it been
traveling at its normal rate of speed.

17:22.910 --> 17:25.070
The shooter was standing
right here.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.113
<i>One other thing, Detective.</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:33.084
Excuse me. Agent Merriweather's
firearm- the safety's still on.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.053
We assumed he just didn't
have time to flick it off.

17:36.156 --> 17:41.287
Agent Marin, why don't you explain
to the detectives why that is unlikely.

17:41.395 --> 17:45.388
If he was a police officer, it would make
sense because your academy trains you...

17:45.499 --> 17:48.798
to draw your weapon and flip
the safety in two separate actions...

17:48.902 --> 17:50.961
to avoid accidental shootings.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.665
Our academy trains us to draw
and flip in a single motion.

17:53.774 --> 17:56.572
If he managed to draw his weapon,
his safety should have been off.

17:56.677 --> 17:59.840
<i>A protective agent maybe draws his weapon</i>
<i>once an entire presidential term.</i>

17:59.947 --> 18:03.474
<i>When we draw our weapon,</i>
<i>we intend to use it.</i>

18:03.584 --> 18:05.848
Bottom line-
Agent Merriweather was assassinated.

18:05.953 --> 18:10.287
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.

18:10.390 --> 18:15.191
If this man was one of yours, you would have
treated him with a lot more respect.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.758
Let's get a gurney up here!

18:31.712 --> 18:34.340
<i>It always amazes me</i>
<i>how thorough you are.</i>

18:34.448 --> 18:37.008
Well, we try to do
the best job we can.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.449
Hopefully you sleep better at night.

18:39.553 --> 18:44.217
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola. We're good on the perimeter.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.020
<i>- I'm 10-60.</i>
- Uh, roger, 10-60.

18:47.127 --> 18:52.030
I let DiPaola go early,
so, uh, he can...

18:52.132 --> 18:54.100
get something to eat.

19:02.609 --> 19:06.238
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.808
You all right?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.854
I missed you.
I missed you so much.

19:15.956 --> 19:19.050
- Just a second.
- Okay.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.704
- This is outstanding.
- There you go. And enjoy.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.989
I love you, Sarah.

20:24.091 --> 20:27.151
<i>Garrison, DiPaola. Where are you?</i>

20:27.260 --> 20:29.728
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.667
Yeah, I'm on my way.

20:37.771 --> 20:40.137
Hi. So what the hell
is going on, or-

20:40.240 --> 20:43.641
Aziz, what are you doin' here?

20:43.744 --> 20:46.338
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.

20:48.949 --> 20:51.577
He- He was murdered?

20:51.685 --> 20:53.778
P.I.D. thinks it might
be connected to work.

20:53.887 --> 20:56.720
Director put us on alert.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.451
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.624
Was there any kind
of shift in his behavior?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.699
Was he agitated
or worried about anything?

21:09.870 --> 21:12.862
<i>He was a little distant</i>
<i>at breakfast on Sunday.</i>

21:12.973 --> 21:16.966
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple
of tough days at work.

21:17.077 --> 21:22.310
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip. Uh, it's kind of personal.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.645
Nancy, I know how difficult
this is for you...

21:24.751 --> 21:29.654
but I need a complete picture
if I'm gonna investigate this properly.

21:29.756 --> 21:33.692
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was
having an affair with someone's wife at work.

21:33.794 --> 21:37.662
- Just gossip. It just-
- Yeah.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.494
Probably not even true.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.762
Look, that's all we need for now.

21:51.211 --> 21:54.476
<i>- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?</i>
- Screw you.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.242
- What?
- Screw you.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.147
- You still got a problem with me?
<i>- Take your hands off of me.</i>

22:02.255 --> 22:05.520
Christ. It doesn't matter
what I say to you.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.093
I don't care if you got
a problem with me...

22:08.195 --> 22:11.187
but you show respect
when you come to this house.

22:11.298 --> 22:13.266
Charlie was one of my best friends.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.096
If you have information
that can help me, that I want to hear.

22:16.203 --> 22:18.763
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine. You're a piece of work.

22:18.872 --> 22:20.772
You know, Nancy did say one thing.

22:20.874 --> 22:24.071
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?

22:24.177 --> 22:27.874
- No.
- Then if you figure it out,
you know where to find me.

22:27.981 --> 22:30.882
- Yeah, good. I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.

22:30.984 --> 22:33.612
- Hey. Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill. Yeah.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.688
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.984
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.184
But don't listen
to everything he's got to say.

22:40.293 --> 22:42.557
- Especially about me.
<i>- Okay.</i>

22:42.662 --> 22:45.096
Pete.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.598
There some problem between you two?

22:47.701 --> 22:49.896
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.

22:50.003 --> 22:52.870
- So what happened?
- It's personal.

22:52.973 --> 22:55.032
<i>Let's go.</i>

22:55.141 --> 22:59.407
- No. He can go to hell. I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.480
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.049
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.

23:04.150 --> 23:09.417
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already
told him 30 times? This is why I left him.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.355
He's the most pigheaded man
I've ever met.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.928
You still love him, don't you?

23:34.381 --> 23:36.781
<i>- Hey, Pete. Pete.</i>
- Hey, Tom.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.783
You know a guy
named Walter Xavier?

23:38.885 --> 23:41.945
Yeah, sure. He's a snitch I used to use
when I was working in counterfeiting.

23:42.055 --> 23:43.955
Okay. Just fielded a call
from this guy.

23:44.057 --> 23:46.116
I told him you weren't
running informants anymore...

23:46.226 --> 23:49.161
offered to transfer
the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.

23:49.262 --> 23:53.426
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.

23:59.839 --> 24:04.674
<i>There he is! Publishers Clearing House,</i>
<i>my man! You got somethin' for me?</i>

24:04.778 --> 24:07.303
Did you fill yours out yet?

24:07.414 --> 24:11.282
<i>Every year my mom bugs me</i>
<i>to fill that thing out. I never do.</i>

24:11.384 --> 24:13.318
<i>Long time, no see, Walter.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

24:13.420 --> 24:15.388
Let's walk.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.089
You got some info on that
Charlie Merriweather murder?

24:21.194 --> 24:23.890
- That agent who was killed
outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.

24:23.997 --> 24:26.966
Maybe he stumbled into something
he wasn't supposed to, like I did.

24:27.067 --> 24:30.503
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.

24:32.939 --> 24:36.340
Walter, you know, it's a little
more difficult than it sounds.

24:36.443 --> 24:39.003
Not if you got somebody inside.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.113
You saying there's a mole
in the Secret Service?

24:43.216 --> 24:45.116
That's right.

24:45.218 --> 24:48.210
- There's an agent who wants to
help assassinate the president?
- That's right.

24:48.321 --> 24:52.018
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know. I just know he exists.

24:52.125 --> 24:55.356
Well, how? Who-Who's giving
you the information?

24:55.462 --> 24:57.987
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?

24:58.098 --> 25:00.157
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.

25:04.971 --> 25:08.737
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up,
they gonna know I'm the one.

25:08.842 --> 25:11.037
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.

25:11.144 --> 25:15.046
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.

25:15.148 --> 25:18.276
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.

25:18.385 --> 25:21.616
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents
in on an assassination attempt.

25:21.721 --> 25:25.122
Here. Maybe this will change
your mind, okay?

25:34.501 --> 25:37.493
<i>Call signs, code words,</i>
<i>today's encryption keys!</i>

25:37.604 --> 25:39.504
Yeah, whoever this traitor is...

25:39.606 --> 25:42.507
they're either on the president's detail
or in a key liaison position.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.373
Listen, I want a list of everyone
who's got "Q" clearance.

25:45.478 --> 25:47.446
And where's the president
right now?

25:47.547 --> 25:49.879
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.

25:49.983 --> 25:54.613
<i>This morning's action demonstrates</i>
<i>our continuing resolve...</i>

25:54.721 --> 25:57.417
to take on the infrastructure
of terrorism...

25:57.524 --> 25:59.549
wherever we find it
anywhere around the globe.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.752
How reliable is this guy Xavier?

26:01.861 --> 26:04.955
I've built three counterfeiting cases
using his information.

26:05.065 --> 26:08.660
<i>- Against who?</i>
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.971
Sir. That's everyone
with "Q" clearance.

26:13.073 --> 26:15.234
<i>Those who actually commit terrorist acts.</i>

26:15.341 --> 26:17.468
<i>Now let me point out,</i>
<i>this is very important-</i>

26:17.577 --> 26:20.171
Polygraph everyone
on that list...

26:20.280 --> 26:22.714
and stand up a red team
to find the traitor.

26:22.816 --> 26:26.115
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit
on Merriweather is connected to this...

26:26.219 --> 26:28.483
<i>so let's fold that investigation in as well.</i>

26:28.588 --> 26:31.921
- And we put Breckinridge
in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?

26:32.025 --> 26:35.961
- Yeah.
- Pete. He's kind of a protÃ©gÃ© of yours.
What do you think?

26:36.062 --> 26:40.021
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
<i>- Then he's the guy.</i>

26:40.133 --> 26:42.260
You can have anybody you want.

26:42.368 --> 26:46.168
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.604
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.

26:48.708 --> 26:52.701
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.474
She hasn't been ruined
by years in the field.

26:55.582 --> 27:00.576
<i> I will blow you up.</i>
<i>I come to bomb this country.</i>

27:00.687 --> 27:04.487
<i>Holy wars.</i>

27:04.591 --> 27:06.718
We have intel that
representatives of Al-Qaeda...

27:06.826 --> 27:09.693
have met on at least two occasions
with the Barranquilla leadership.

27:09.796 --> 27:13.664
You think it's timed to coincide
with the Camp David talks?

27:13.766 --> 27:16.326
Probably. The threat alone
interferes with the process.

27:16.436 --> 27:18.063
<i>We pulled 50 agents</i>
<i>in from the field.</i>

27:18.171 --> 27:21.504
People who haven't worked
at the White House in at least two cycles.

27:21.608 --> 27:23.633
They'll integrate
with both of your teams.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.906
We're all gonna be looking over
each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.

27:37.657 --> 27:41.320
Well, do what you have to to protect me,
but I want the threat...

27:41.427 --> 27:46.490
the investigation,
I want everything kept classified.

27:46.599 --> 27:50.160
<i>As far as the public is concerned,</i>
<i>I'm just carrying on my normal business.</i>

27:50.270 --> 27:52.170
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President...

27:52.272 --> 27:54.399
we're going to need to get
everyone involved here.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.067
What do you think would happen
to the power of the president...

27:57.177 --> 27:59.771
if people thought I wasn't even safe
from my own Secret Service?

27:59.879 --> 28:03.246
It took over 200 years to create
the symbol of the presidency...

28:03.349 --> 28:06.443
and I'm not gonna undermine it
with something like this.

28:06.553 --> 28:10.319
- Let's circle the wagons, okay? You all right?
- Fine.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.391
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?

28:12.492 --> 28:15.154
Bill, you're the guy.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.627
You're the last line of defense.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.766
You can protect him better
than any of us can.

28:21.868 --> 28:26.498
Is there anything else that you can think of
that'll help you do that?

28:26.606 --> 28:29.234
Yeah.

28:29.342 --> 28:31.435
This.

28:33.813 --> 28:37.909
<i> And I promise you,</i>
<i>right here and now, we're gonna win this one.</i>

28:38.017 --> 28:41.111
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much. Good night.

28:41.221 --> 28:43.451
Good night. Thank you.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.354
Heads it's Sixth Street,
tails it's Eighth.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.797
Bravo cars.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.067
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.262
Classic is moving to bravo cars.

28:58.371 --> 29:01.306
<i> Copy that.</i>
<i>Command to alpha cars. You are off the hook.</i>

29:01.407 --> 29:03.068
Sir, could you put down that knife?

29:03.176 --> 29:06.077
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.147
Hello, young lady.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.987
Where'd this guy come from?

29:16.089 --> 29:19.456
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.

29:19.559 --> 29:21.527
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.

30:09.809 --> 30:12.437
What's wrong?

30:13.946 --> 30:15.811
It's nothing.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.645
- Are you sure?
- Yes. It's okay.

30:18.751 --> 30:23.017
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.319
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
<i>- You ever tried?</i>

30:29.462 --> 30:31.487
- What?
- Have you ever tried?

30:33.633 --> 30:36.830
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.370
You better be right.

30:39.472 --> 30:42.930
You get in touch with us
as soon as you find him.

30:45.511 --> 30:49.072
<i>Could be any one of them.</i>
<i>It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?</i>

30:49.182 --> 30:54.176
<i>- What percentage of your people</i>
<i>have had a polygraph?</i>
- A little over half.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.256
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.424
Heads up!

31:02.528 --> 31:06.862
I want everybody in this room to have had
a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. this afternoon...

31:06.966 --> 31:09.958
<i>or don't show up for work tomorrow.</i>

31:13.239 --> 31:15.207
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.

31:15.308 --> 31:18.243
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.869
<i>- Were you born in Alabama?</i>
- No.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.710
<i> Have you ever had contact</i>
<i>with child pornography?</i>

31:23.816 --> 31:26.444
Uh, yes. I was involved
with an investigation with the bureau-

31:26.552 --> 31:32.115
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan. Yes.

31:38.431 --> 31:40.626
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.701
Get your polygraph today.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.973
How did they get these?

31:49.075 --> 31:53.011
Night-vision camera on a boat
stabilized by a gyroscope.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.080
Pretty sophisticated.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.957
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.117
I'm sorry.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.162
It's gotta be someone
inside the Service.

32:12.265 --> 32:15.325
<i>Somebody could have picked it up.</i>
<i>They're good. That's what they do.</i>

32:15.435 --> 32:17.335
Who?

32:17.437 --> 32:19.598
The same agent plotting
to kill John? Who?

32:19.705 --> 32:24.233
141 years there's never been
a traitor in the Secret Service.

32:24.343 --> 32:27.710
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.

32:27.814 --> 32:29.782
Somehow they're connected.

32:29.882 --> 32:33.147
Maybe this is the assassination?

32:33.252 --> 32:36.119
This is a death sentence for John,
a political death sentence.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.315
That's not gonna happen.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.358
Oh, Pete.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.827
<i>Sarah, I promise.</i>

32:43.930 --> 32:45.864
Let's get this goddamn
witch hunt over with.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.830
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.

32:47.934 --> 32:50.835
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.

32:50.937 --> 32:55.203
- Have you received adequate training
for your profession?
- No.

32:55.308 --> 32:57.538
But I did stay
in a Holiday Inn Express.

32:57.643 --> 33:01.204
<i>Have you ever violated Secret Service</i>
<i>protocol in the past 30 days?</i>

33:01.314 --> 33:03.578
No.

33:03.683 --> 33:05.674
Have you done anything
in the past 30 days...

33:05.785 --> 33:07.753
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.

33:07.854 --> 33:10.823
<i>Are you involved in a plot to kill</i>
<i>the president of the United States?</i>

33:10.923 --> 33:13.653
No.

33:30.309 --> 33:33.335
I could use a few of those.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.941
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.

33:40.052 --> 33:42.748
You look worse.

33:43.890 --> 33:45.858
I haven't slept since
we went on alert.

33:47.393 --> 33:50.590
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.

33:52.965 --> 33:56.093
<i>Have you done your polygraph yet?</i>

33:56.202 --> 34:01.299
- You know I can't even
let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.535
<i>- Is your name Peter Garrison?</i>
- Yes.

34:04.644 --> 34:08.580
<i>- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?</i>
- No.

34:08.681 --> 34:12.310
<i>- Were you divorced in 1998?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

34:12.418 --> 34:16.821
<i>Have you violated Secret Service</i>
<i>protocols in the last 30 days?</i>

34:18.757 --> 34:20.851
No.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.190
Have you done anything
to endanger the life...

34:23.295 --> 34:25.491
of our president
in the last six months?

34:27.632 --> 34:30.101
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.170
No. No.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.610
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.

34:49.855 --> 34:54.349
<i>Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?</i>
<i>Just a moment, sir.</i>

34:54.460 --> 34:56.893
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.

34:56.996 --> 34:59.294
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.

34:59.398 --> 35:03.767
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks
east on Massachusetts Avenue.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.430
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.

37:36.088 --> 37:40.218
<i>Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express...</i>

37:40.326 --> 37:44.126
<i>with stops in Philadelphia,</i>
<i>New York, Boston.</i>

37:44.230 --> 37:46.289
<i>Now boarding, track 4.</i>

38:04.650 --> 38:06.550
F.B.I. Drop it!

38:06.652 --> 38:10.144
- Federal agent! Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze! Put it down!

38:10.256 --> 38:13.225
- The gun is going down!
- All right. Back up now. Back up.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.953
<i>Turn around!</i>

38:22.268 --> 38:25.931
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.

38:26.038 --> 38:30.065
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?

38:30.176 --> 38:32.337
Sorry for the crossover.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.178
<i>Pete! I called four times.</i>
<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

38:42.288 --> 38:44.188
We're not out of here till tomorrow.

38:44.290 --> 38:48.158
The president decided they should arrive
at the summit together. Where were you?

38:48.260 --> 38:51.525
Oh! Excuse me.

38:51.630 --> 38:56.033
Oh, here we are. Now, Kate, this
is your weekend to catch the trout.

38:56.135 --> 38:59.332
- I don't like worms.
- No, no. This is fly-fishing.

39:45.985 --> 39:48.818
Pete, can I talk
to you a minute?

39:48.921 --> 39:50.912
Yes, sir.

39:55.628 --> 39:57.926
We're really, both of us...

39:58.030 --> 40:01.295
in uncharted territory here,
aren't we?

40:06.005 --> 40:08.132
An assassin inside
the Secret Service?

40:08.240 --> 40:10.834
Inside my detail?

40:12.845 --> 40:15.006
Now, Bill's been briefing me,
of course, but...

40:15.114 --> 40:17.014
this guy's your informant, right?

40:17.116 --> 40:19.414
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand...

40:19.518 --> 40:22.351
so let's make time at Camp David
to do that, all right?

40:22.454 --> 40:24.820
Yes, sir.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.365
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.367
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.

40:37.469 --> 40:40.165
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.740
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.

40:42.841 --> 40:46.299
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.

40:46.412 --> 40:48.710
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.

40:58.390 --> 41:01.723
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?

41:01.827 --> 41:04.955
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-

41:05.064 --> 41:06.964
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?

41:07.066 --> 41:10.524
- What's his name? What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.571
- Has he called you?
- Not yet. No.

41:14.606 --> 41:17.302
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

41:17.409 --> 41:19.604
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?

41:19.712 --> 41:22.579
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?

41:22.681 --> 41:25.479
- Well, that's a great idea. How was your flight?
- Short.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.652
<i>- You guys all decent?</i>
- Afraid so.

41:37.763 --> 41:40.254
Your informant's on the phone.

41:40.366 --> 41:43.699
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash...

41:43.802 --> 41:47.329
<i>and a legal document guaranteeing you</i>
<i>the rest once the traitor's apprehended.</i>

41:47.439 --> 41:50.840
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.

41:50.943 --> 41:53.741
<i>I'm not gonna start now.</i>
<i>Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.</i>

41:53.846 --> 41:57.213
<i>Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.</i>

41:57.316 --> 42:00.843
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.750
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.

42:02.855 --> 42:05.289
<i>- Drive fast.</i>
- Okay, you heard him. Let's go.

42:07.126 --> 42:09.424
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.962
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay. Got it.

42:12.064 --> 42:15.124
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.

42:15.234 --> 42:17.134
There's no way
we get surveillance in there.

42:17.236 --> 42:20.763
Hold it. There's no way I'm gonna
let you go without a backup. No.

42:20.873 --> 42:24.639
- Chaminski. Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.

43:45.324 --> 43:47.155
At your 1:00.

43:56.502 --> 43:58.493
<i>Watch your 3:00. Watch your 3:00.</i>

44:38.177 --> 44:40.771
Check your 9:00.

44:42.281 --> 44:45.512
Check your 9:00! Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!

44:57.563 --> 45:00.726
Get down! Secret Service!
Get down!

45:06.138 --> 45:09.266
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Agent down.

45:09.374 --> 45:11.467
<i>Copy that. Breckinridge to Command.</i>

45:11.577 --> 45:13.807
<i>We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.</i>
<i>Agent down.</i>

45:13.912 --> 45:18.246
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.

45:18.350 --> 45:21.751
<i> Command, copy that.</i>
<i>Available units en route. E. T.A. 20 minutes.</i>

45:36.368 --> 45:38.802
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.

45:50.315 --> 45:52.442
Heads.

46:18.010 --> 46:20.478
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.

46:20.579 --> 46:22.342
I'm a hundred yards south of you.

46:22.447 --> 46:24.506
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.

46:24.616 --> 46:27.847
<i>- Work your way towards me.</i>
- Copy that. Stagger off 10 feet.

46:37.062 --> 46:39.189
Get out of here!

46:39.298 --> 46:41.266
Take the point.

46:50.742 --> 46:52.801
I don't have a visual!

46:55.781 --> 46:57.840
Go!

47:03.355 --> 47:05.983
<i>Garrison, Washington Command.</i>

47:06.091 --> 47:10.255
<i>Additional agents and medical assist</i>
<i>are en route. Break. All units, be advised.</i>

47:10.362 --> 47:14.389
<i>Shots fired, Allenwood Mall. One agent is down.</i>
<i>There are multiple civilian casualties.</i>

47:14.499 --> 47:17.730
<i>Shooter is male,</i>
<i>blond hair, dark jacket.</i>

47:35.921 --> 47:37.889
Pete. Pete!

48:17.195 --> 48:19.163
You okay?

48:19.264 --> 48:22.131
Do you have any idea why your informant
wanted to have you killed?

48:22.234 --> 48:24.259
No. I'm wondering the same thing.

48:24.369 --> 48:27.236
You might want to figure
that one out, Pete.

48:28.874 --> 48:30.842
<i>Pete!</i>

48:32.844 --> 48:35.938
Presidential helicopter
just went down.

48:36.047 --> 48:38.242
<i>This is a news center special report.</i>

48:38.350 --> 48:44.220
<i>The presidential helicopter,</i>
Marine One, <i>has crashed.</i>

48:44.322 --> 48:48.782
Marine One,
<i>the presidential helicopter has gone down.</i>

48:48.894 --> 48:50.919
<i>Whether or not the president</i>
<i>was on board has not-</i>

48:51.029 --> 48:53.998
<i>Marine One,</i> the presidential
helicopter has crashed.

48:54.099 --> 48:56.966
It happened just moments ago
about a half mile south of Camp David.

48:57.068 --> 48:59.002
The chopper went down
in some densely wooded-

48:59.104 --> 49:04.201
<i> We're now hearing reports</i>
<i>the president was not on board.</i>

49:04.309 --> 49:06.903
<i>Actually, we can now confirm...</i>

49:07.012 --> 49:08.912
<i>that neither the president</i>
<i>or the first lady...</i>

49:09.014 --> 49:10.914
<i>were on board</i>
<i>at the time of the crash.</i>

49:11.016 --> 49:13.951
<i>The president</i>
<i>and first lady are safe.</i>

49:14.052 --> 49:17.385
<i>If you're just joining us, these are live pictures</i>
<i>just outside Camp David...</i>

49:17.489 --> 49:20.014
<i>- where earlier today,</i> Marine One...

49:20.125 --> 49:22.218
<i>went down shortly after takeoff.</i>

49:22.327 --> 49:26.821
<i>Two hikers who witnessed the crash</i>
<i>reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail...</i>

49:26.932 --> 49:28.832
<i>just before that helicopter went down.</i>

49:28.934 --> 49:31.926
<i>That is leading to the possibility,</i>
<i>unconfirmed by authorities...</i>

49:32.037 --> 49:34.562
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
<i>- that the chopper was shot down...</i>

49:34.673 --> 49:36.573
<i>probably by a shoulder-fired missile.</i>

49:36.675 --> 49:38.575
<i>Now, we want to make clear, again...</i>

49:38.677 --> 49:42.408
<i>- that the president and first lady are safe.</i>

49:56.094 --> 49:58.995
<i> If you are just joining us,</i>
<i>these are live pictures from the scene...</i>

49:59.097 --> 50:04.194
<i>just outside of Camp David, where earlier today</i>
Marine One <i>went down just after takeoff.</i>

50:04.302 --> 50:07.703
<i>Sources say marine and Secret Service</i>
<i>personnel were on that aircraft...</i>

50:07.806 --> 50:10.502
<i>and they were killed in the crash.</i>

50:10.609 --> 50:13.737
<i>This crash is being investigated</i>
<i>by both the White House and the military.</i>

50:13.845 --> 50:17.713
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.

50:17.816 --> 50:19.875
He wasn't on board.

50:19.985 --> 50:24.354
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-

50:27.025 --> 50:28.925
Do you understand?

50:29.027 --> 50:33.464
Now, we're gonna meet
and we're gonna discuss this.

50:36.635 --> 50:38.830
Deadly against
any low-altitude aircraft...

50:38.937 --> 50:41.303
including jets,
prop planes and helicopters.

50:41.406 --> 50:43.966
<i>But that comes from witnesses.</i>

50:44.075 --> 50:45.975
<i>Has not been confirmed by investigators.</i>

50:46.077 --> 50:50.309
<i>Again, these pictures coming to us about-</i>

50:56.988 --> 51:00.583
Well, it sure doesn't look like
you're here to bury the hatchet.

51:00.692 --> 51:03.820
You're being investigated for treason.

51:03.929 --> 51:07.456
- What are you talk-
- Step back.

51:07.566 --> 51:10.899
- Excuse me?
- Step back.

51:18.076 --> 51:20.601
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.

51:20.712 --> 51:23.180
- Matt.
- Pete.

51:23.281 --> 51:25.613
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.

51:27.452 --> 51:30.512
If I failed the polygraph,
then why am I still on duty?

51:30.622 --> 51:33.955
Director didn't want to arrest one of
the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life...

51:34.059 --> 51:36.857
<i>without a little more evidence.</i>

51:36.962 --> 51:39.430
How long you been working
for the Barranquilla Cartel?

51:39.531 --> 51:43.797
What are you talking about?

51:43.902 --> 51:47.963
Hugo, can you come in here, please?

51:48.073 --> 51:52.100
Pete Garrison,
Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.

51:52.210 --> 51:54.804
<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?</i>

51:54.913 --> 51:58.041
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?

51:58.149 --> 52:01.676
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?

52:01.786 --> 52:04.550
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.

52:04.656 --> 52:07.022
And that you almost missed
the <i>Marine One</i> flight yesterday.

52:07.125 --> 52:09.286
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.

52:09.394 --> 52:11.555
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.

52:11.663 --> 52:15.190
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?

52:15.300 --> 52:18.531
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop
for the Barranquilla Cartel.

52:18.637 --> 52:21.629
<i> You screwed up, Pete.</i>
<i>You walked into a stakeout.</i>

52:21.740 --> 52:23.833
I wanna know your number one
go-to guy at the cartel.

52:23.942 --> 52:28.208
And I wanna know how you were gonna
help them kill the president.

52:28.313 --> 52:32.579
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?

52:32.684 --> 52:36.484
<i>To be honest with you, I don't care.</i>
<i>I know what the evidence is telling me.</i>

52:36.588 --> 52:39.182
I have given my entire life
to the Secret Service.

52:39.290 --> 52:43.590
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m.
every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?

52:43.695 --> 52:46.994
You're bitter after all your years of service
that they didn't make you director?

52:47.098 --> 52:50.499
Oh, no. Don't confuse your own ambition
with mine. Okay, Dave?

52:50.602 --> 52:53.002
Come on, Pete. Think about it.
People would understand that.

52:53.104 --> 52:56.596
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet
for the president of the United States.

52:56.708 --> 52:59.734
<i>And in the 25 years since,</i>
<i>you haven't even made shift supervisor...</i>

52:59.844 --> 53:02.506
<i>on a presidential detail,</i>
<i>and that I know you wanted.</i>

53:02.614 --> 53:05.344
<i>But they don't put guys</i>
<i>that bend the rules, not even a little bit...</i>

53:05.450 --> 53:07.350
in charge of P.P.D., do they?

53:07.452 --> 53:09.716
Even if they did take
a bullet for the old man.

53:09.821 --> 53:12.517
<i>Is that your professional</i>
<i>or personal opinion?</i>

53:12.624 --> 53:15.422
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.

53:15.527 --> 53:18.223
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
<i>- Has nothing to do with Cindy.</i>

53:18.329 --> 53:20.524
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!

53:20.632 --> 53:23.533
We're talking about it all the time,
even when we're not talking about it!

53:23.635 --> 53:26.229
You can't look at me
without thinking about it!

53:26.337 --> 53:28.897
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.

53:29.007 --> 53:32.408
You think I wrecked your marriage,
and it has completely clouded your judgment.

53:32.510 --> 53:34.910
I am following the evidence
and it is overwhelming.

53:35.013 --> 53:38.471
The polygraph. Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to <i>Marine One.</i>

53:38.583 --> 53:41.143
It was hit by a missile
for Christ's sake!

53:41.252 --> 53:43.447
It was hit by a missile
because the flares...

53:43.555 --> 53:45.819
and the four other countermeasures
were disengaged!

53:45.924 --> 53:49.291
There was a hundred other people
who had access to it.

53:51.029 --> 53:53.589
Explain to me
about the bank account.

53:53.698 --> 53:56.895
- The what? The-
<i>- Your signature's all over the paperwork.</i>

53:57.001 --> 53:59.492
I'm being framed.

53:59.604 --> 54:02.334
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!

54:02.440 --> 54:04.431
I'm the guy that initiated
this investigation.

54:04.542 --> 54:06.806
Why would I do that
if I wanted to kill the president?

54:06.911 --> 54:09.812
You initiated this investigation
for a traitor in our department...

54:09.914 --> 54:12.348
so that when the assassination
actually took place...

54:12.450 --> 54:14.350
<i>you'd be at the bottom</i>
<i>of the list of suspects.</i>

54:14.452 --> 54:17.512
<i>I'm being framed!</i>
<i>Goddamn it! Just think about it.</i>

54:17.622 --> 54:21.023
You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!

54:21.126 --> 54:23.594
The director just rolled up outside.

54:23.695 --> 54:27.062
You better start thinking
about cooperating.

54:34.539 --> 54:36.666
He's in the car.

54:53.124 --> 54:57.026
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.

54:58.897 --> 55:01.229
<i>Director's come all the way</i>
<i>down here to see me, huh?</i>

55:03.935 --> 55:08.235
- That's very impressive.
<i>- It's embarrassing for us, sir.</i>

55:08.339 --> 55:10.398
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-

55:15.079 --> 55:16.876
Garrison back door.

55:19.951 --> 55:22.715
Oh, shit.

55:27.258 --> 55:28.885
Pete!

55:28.993 --> 55:31.484
Pete!

55:33.198 --> 55:35.758
Where is he?

55:37.101 --> 55:39.069
Sorry.

55:43.274 --> 55:47.870
This is Breckinridge. Garrison has escaped
from the rear of the residence into the alley.

55:51.382 --> 55:54.374
Cordon off the area
and get back to me.

55:55.486 --> 55:57.852
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.

55:57.956 --> 56:00.049
He got your gun?
And your radio?

56:00.158 --> 56:02.126
<i>What the hell are you</i>
<i>lookin' at her for?</i>

56:02.227 --> 56:05.196
<i>She's been here two days.</i>
<i>How long have you been here?</i>

56:17.375 --> 56:19.900
<i>Where to, mister?</i>

56:20.011 --> 56:22.377
Just get me out of here.

56:39.030 --> 56:44.127
<i>I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison</i>
<i>could be involved with something like this.</i>

56:44.235 --> 56:48.296
<i>For most of you he's a friend,</i>
<i>to some, a legend.</i>

56:48.406 --> 56:50.806
But the fact is, the evidence
against him is overwhelming.

56:50.909 --> 56:54.345
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.

56:54.445 --> 56:58.779
<i>He is smarter and</i>
<i>more experienced than all of you.</i>

56:58.883 --> 57:01.943
<i>You've never trained for this.</i>
<i>You are chasing your worst nightmare.</i>

57:02.053 --> 57:05.614
<i>He knows how you think. He knows what</i>
<i>you know. And he knows how you operate.</i>

57:05.723 --> 57:08.089
And he will use that against you.

57:08.192 --> 57:12.151
He also knows that it's gonna be
very difficult for you...

57:12.263 --> 57:15.960
to pull the trigger
if you have him in your sights.

57:16.067 --> 57:20.094
So I want you to take a second
and visualize that.

57:20.204 --> 57:26.040
<i>Because there is a very good chance</i>
<i>that is exactly how this is going to end.</i>

57:26.144 --> 57:29.477
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure. Take it.

57:29.580 --> 57:32.174
Yeah?

57:37.555 --> 57:40.285
<i>Fullback, Backstop. Do you have an arrival?</i>

57:40.391 --> 57:42.450
<i>Backstop, Fullback. We have arrival.</i>

57:56.240 --> 57:58.902
Backstop, go.

57:59.010 --> 58:02.707
Cincinnati wrapping up. We're alpha for departure.

58:15.093 --> 58:18.859
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean? I really literally do.

58:38.616 --> 58:41.210
<i>He taps him on the back and the bear says...</i>

58:41.319 --> 58:44.049
<i>"You didn't come here</i>
<i>to hunt, did ya?"</i>

58:44.155 --> 58:47.249
<i>Get it? The bear.</i>

58:47.358 --> 58:50.555
<i>That's not funny, man.</i>

58:50.661 --> 58:54.427
<i>- That joke ain't funny at all.</i>

59:09.981 --> 59:13.610
<i>- Fullback. We're movin'.</i>
<i>- Roger that. We're set up.</i>

59:27.198 --> 59:29.792
See you later, okay?
Be right back.

59:34.005 --> 59:35.905
Thank you.

59:36.007 --> 59:40.637
- Welke, DiPaola. Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.

01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:04.501
Ma'am.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.382
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.

01:00:19.484 --> 01:00:23.284
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days,
I want you to know I was framed.

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:27.346
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:31.224
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?

01:00:31.329 --> 01:00:33.297
I haven't figured that out yet.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:36.457
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.

01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:40.560
- Yes, you do. I'll go to John. I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:46.268
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:48.971
- You can cover my back.
- How?

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.914
The director has got a daily password
for the agents. Find out what it is.

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:24.103
- I'm checking through stuff.
<i>- Hey, guys. Garrison just used his cell phone.</i>

01:01:24.215 --> 01:01:26.877
<i>He called Chez Doucette.</i>

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:33.351
You turned around
when it rang, didn't you?

01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:35.516
Yeah, I did.

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:38.390
Ballsy. Very ballsy.

01:01:38.496 --> 01:01:40.657
DiPaola said she seemed
completely unfazed.

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:44.064
She came upstairs, waited five minutes
and told him what happened.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:45.897
Okay.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:51.198
I'm just trying to understand
why he came here and why she reacted that way.

01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:53.277
- This is your post?
<i>- Yeah, it is.</i>

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:55.572
Naturally, the first lady
doesn't want to believe...

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.308
the man protecting her
for the last eight months...

01:01:58.416 --> 01:02:00.976
is trying to assassinate her husband.

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.417
That's why Pete came here.

01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:05.887
He's looking for an ally.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:09.289
And the first lady is
a very powerful ally to have.

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:20.528
Great. The idea is
to secure the entire site.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:26.736
<i>I want you to get every stolen car report</i>
<i>for the entire area.</i>

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:29.404
Start looking for cars
that were taken within walking distance...

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.947
of the restaurant
or any of the nearby metro stations.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:35.246
Then within those parameters,
I want you to isolate Accords...

01:02:35.353 --> 01:02:38.322
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind
of car he's gonna steal?

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:41.357
<i>Those are the four most commonly</i>
<i>registered vehicles in the D.C. area.</i>

01:02:41.459 --> 01:02:43.723
<i>Pete knows that.</i>
<i>He's gonna want to blend in.</i>

01:02:43.828 --> 01:02:47.457
<i>And the first thing he's gonna</i>
<i>want to do is find his informant.</i>

01:04:16.718 --> 01:04:20.381
If he tries to breach our computers,
we can find out where he's connecting from.

01:04:20.488 --> 01:04:22.888
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:26.050
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.594
Well, he'd need
that person's password.

01:04:28.696 --> 01:04:31.859
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard
to get access to others' passwords.

01:04:31.966 --> 01:04:35.197
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.

01:04:35.303 --> 01:04:37.965
We have his credit cards,
his cell phone.

01:04:38.072 --> 01:04:41.235
<i>He has no other place to hide.</i>

01:04:52.987 --> 01:04:55.820
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

01:04:55.923 --> 01:05:00.326
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.

01:05:00.428 --> 01:05:05.388
Oh, lovely boy,
but he been gone a long time.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:10.130
- Well, this is the address
we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?

01:05:10.238 --> 01:05:14.732
- Yes, ma'am. I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?

01:05:14.842 --> 01:05:18.073
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.

01:05:18.179 --> 01:05:20.647
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.

01:05:20.748 --> 01:05:24.479
Mrs. Miller. I'm remarried.

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:27.611
Would you have another address
or telephone number where I might reach him?

01:05:27.722 --> 01:05:32.489
Oh, I'd love to help ya
get in touch with Walter.

01:05:32.593 --> 01:05:35.790
Bet he could use the money, but...

01:05:35.897 --> 01:05:38.627
I don't know where he is.

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:42.100
Walter and me haven't spoke
in three years.

01:05:42.203 --> 01:05:45.695
Well, if you do talk to him,
tell him we got in touch.

01:05:45.807 --> 01:05:48.241
Thank you, ma'am.

01:05:49.777 --> 01:05:52.211
Have a good day.

01:06:14.669 --> 01:06:16.830
Leave a message.

01:06:16.938 --> 01:06:18.838
Walter, it's Mom.

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:24.037
A guy just come by the house
lookin' for ya. He's a cop.

01:07:34.315 --> 01:07:37.751
On a gut level
it doesn't make sense.

01:07:37.852 --> 01:07:41.117
- The only thing this guy
cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?

01:07:41.222 --> 01:07:44.555
Because he went out to the Academy
a few times and ran your field exercises?

01:07:44.659 --> 01:07:47.651
Listen to me. Pete Garrison
was my best friend...

01:07:47.762 --> 01:07:51.858
for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.

01:07:51.966 --> 01:07:56.733
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing
Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.

01:07:56.837 --> 01:07:58.998
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola...

01:07:59.106 --> 01:08:01.506
just signed in to our databases
using DiPaola's password.

01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:06.603
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.

01:08:06.714 --> 01:08:09.683
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:43.278
Walter!

01:09:28.295 --> 01:09:30.593
<i>Notify Intel we've got a body.</i>

01:10:11.305 --> 01:10:14.365
Take the cars around
to the other side!

01:10:55.616 --> 01:10:57.584
Pete!

01:11:05.559 --> 01:11:08.255
Pete!

01:11:14.435 --> 01:11:16.960
Damn it.

01:11:49.103 --> 01:11:52.334
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.

01:11:52.439 --> 01:11:56.000
<i>- Set up a perimeter now. Do you copy?</i>
- Copy that.

01:12:00.648 --> 01:12:03.048
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.

01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:05.948
<i>Get your men</i>
<i>to the back of the boat.</i>

01:12:16.096 --> 01:12:18.656
Pete, don't move!

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:38.348
Pete!

01:12:42.856 --> 01:12:45.916
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
<i>- Fine.</i>

01:12:46.026 --> 01:12:48.756
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.

01:12:48.862 --> 01:12:52.730
- The only reason that I'm alive
is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:55.063
<i>- No way!</i>
- Don't make me do this. Pete!

01:13:09.216 --> 01:13:11.616
You want to shoot me?

01:13:11.719 --> 01:13:14.381
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!

01:13:14.488 --> 01:13:18.219
<i>Dave! My buddy!</i>

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.287
Come on! Shoot me!

01:13:22.396 --> 01:13:25.092
<i>Come on. Shoot me.</i>

01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:01.997
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.

01:14:02.102 --> 01:14:03.182
I couldn't take the second shot.

01:14:03.217 --> 01:14:04.263
I couldn't take the second shot.

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:12.678
<i>What's the least</i>
<i>contained environment...</i>

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.943
- the president's going to be in
over the next few days?
- G8 Summit. Toronto.

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:18.314
It's a nightmare for us.

01:14:18.419 --> 01:14:21.479
Canadians are allowing the protestors
all the way up to the three perimeter.

01:14:21.588 --> 01:14:25.615
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.126
You really think it's him,
don't you?

01:14:53.387 --> 01:14:56.322
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry. I can explain everything.

01:14:56.423 --> 01:14:59.290
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?

01:15:06.467 --> 01:15:11.427
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination
plot by one of the other agents...

01:15:11.538 --> 01:15:15.338
so I want to check his computer files,
see if there's any indication of evidence.

01:15:15.442 --> 01:15:17.706
Is that why there's a car
watching the house?

01:15:22.716 --> 01:15:24.616
<i>The maroon Cadillac.</i>

01:15:24.718 --> 01:15:28.552
<i>- Who are they?</i>
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.

01:15:28.655 --> 01:15:33.388
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys
to your car, and I want you to call the police.

01:15:33.494 --> 01:15:36.395
<i>Not the Secret Service.</i>
<i>The police. Tell 'em about the Cadillac.</i>

01:15:36.497 --> 01:15:39.466
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:16:39.092 --> 01:16:42.323
<i>I was waiting there maybe three hours.</i>
<i>Nobody showed up.</i>

01:16:42.429 --> 01:16:44.659
<i>I didn't want</i>
<i>to stay there all day.</i>

01:16:44.765 --> 01:16:47.928
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.

01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:55.036
What do you want me to do?

01:16:55.142 --> 01:16:58.805
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.

01:16:58.912 --> 01:17:01.346
Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no.

01:17:01.448 --> 01:17:03.439
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:08.510
<i>I'm not gonna stay there all night.</i>
<i>She's not gonna be a problem.</i>

01:17:11.425 --> 01:17:13.723
<i>No, no. no.</i>

01:17:13.827 --> 01:17:16.193
<i>Yes, yes, by herself.</i>

01:17:16.296 --> 01:17:18.491
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

01:17:39.353 --> 01:17:41.583
Shooting. Shooting.

01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:55.091
- Huh? Huh?
- Shooting!

01:17:59.306 --> 01:18:01.604
Your name? Your name!

01:18:03.176 --> 01:18:06.373
Who sent you? Who sent you!

01:18:30.804 --> 01:18:33.034
Come on. Come on.

01:19:32.633 --> 01:19:34.760
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?

01:19:34.868 --> 01:19:37.302
Yeah. Look, I just got into a shootout.

01:19:37.404 --> 01:19:39.872
1265 Leslie, Northwest.

01:19:39.973 --> 01:19:44.103
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.

01:19:44.211 --> 01:19:49.205
He's got full security access
to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.

01:19:49.316 --> 01:19:53.446
<i>Okay, Pete. We're on it.</i>
<i>But I really think you should come in.</i>

01:19:53.553 --> 01:19:55.521
Yeah.

01:20:01.028 --> 01:20:05.124
Pete, we've been through the entire place,
but you're gonna have to be straight with me.

01:20:05.232 --> 01:20:08.292
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.

01:20:08.402 --> 01:20:11.565
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over...

01:20:11.672 --> 01:20:14.573
but there's no body, no passports,
no G8 credentials.

01:20:14.675 --> 01:20:17.974
Listen. This is not enough
to take back to Overbrook and clear you.

01:20:18.078 --> 01:20:20.546
<i>Dave, I don't know</i>
<i>what to tell you.</i>

01:20:20.647 --> 01:20:24.413
They're gonna hit him
in Toronto, G8 Summit.

01:20:24.518 --> 01:20:27.351
Pete. Pete?

01:20:30.323 --> 01:20:33.781
Sarah?

01:20:33.894 --> 01:20:36.522
Listen, I'm leaving
for Toronto tonight.

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:39.622
Montrose wants to move me
up there early for security purposes.

01:20:39.733 --> 01:20:41.724
Oh!

01:20:45.539 --> 01:20:47.837
California. My sister.
I'll call her back.

01:20:47.941 --> 01:20:52.776
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm- I'm reasonably happy.

01:20:52.879 --> 01:20:56.076
Maybe you could take a look
at that if you get a chance.

01:20:56.183 --> 01:20:59.880
<i>Sure. Then I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
<i>I'll be up after the meeting.</i>

01:20:59.986 --> 01:21:02.352
Okay. Thanks.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.300
<i>One new message.</i>

01:21:15.402 --> 01:21:19.498
<i>Sarah, I want you to know</i>
<i>if I don't make it, I was doing my job.</i>

01:21:19.606 --> 01:21:22.131
I've got to turn this off
before they track me.

01:21:22.242 --> 01:21:24.210
I love you.

01:21:30.317 --> 01:21:32.877
I want you to get the crime scene unit
out here immediately.

01:21:32.986 --> 01:21:35.887
Rip this place apart. Find me something now.

01:21:35.989 --> 01:21:37.923
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?

01:21:38.024 --> 01:21:41.425
Sarah Ballentine.

01:21:43.029 --> 01:21:44.997
<i>Come in.</i>

01:21:46.933 --> 01:21:50.300
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

01:21:50.403 --> 01:21:52.234
Thanks, Tom.

01:21:54.407 --> 01:21:57.069
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

01:21:59.479 --> 01:22:01.606
You know, most women
don't like whiskey...

01:22:01.715 --> 01:22:05.446
but my mama was from Tennessee.

01:22:09.456 --> 01:22:12.016
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.

01:22:15.295 --> 01:22:19.197
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.

01:22:20.734 --> 01:22:23.498
You know, I don't know
all the evidence you have against him...

01:22:23.603 --> 01:22:26.800
but I do know why he failed
the lie detector test.

01:22:26.907 --> 01:22:32.038
And I know why he was
in that coffee shop looking for someone.

01:23:16.156 --> 01:23:20.149
Hello. U.S. Secret Service
up for the G8.

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.820
I got a priority item
for the duty officer over at the lab.

01:23:22.929 --> 01:23:26.922
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.

01:23:27.033 --> 01:23:29.524
Sign the log, please.

01:23:36.076 --> 01:23:40.012
I need any prints that
you can find off this cup.

01:23:40.113 --> 01:23:42.604
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

01:23:44.851 --> 01:23:46.944
See you in about 12 minutes.

01:24:05.138 --> 01:24:07.698
<i>Sweeps two and three now complete.</i>

01:24:47.414 --> 01:24:49.882
I'm gonna be pushing
post in a few minutes...

01:24:49.983 --> 01:24:52.076
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.

01:24:52.185 --> 01:24:55.746
- Hey, Jill. This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.

01:24:55.855 --> 01:24:58.323
I'm sure they are.

01:24:58.425 --> 01:25:00.586
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No. Nothing.

01:25:00.694 --> 01:25:05.256
I did. You gotta help me out. If I e-mail
the prints to you, how long is it gonna take...

01:25:05.365 --> 01:25:08.027
to check them against the F.B.I.
and C.I.A. databases?

01:25:08.134 --> 01:25:10.034
Five minutes after I receive 'em.

01:25:10.136 --> 01:25:13.765
I'll call you five minutes
after I send them. Bye.

01:25:13.873 --> 01:25:16.603
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?

01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:19.543
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.

01:25:44.938 --> 01:25:47.771
In my experience a guilty man
doesn't break into a police station...

01:25:47.874 --> 01:25:50.206
and check fingerprints
for a few hours.

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:52.278
What do you think?

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:57.973
My phone was only on
for five minutes.

01:25:58.084 --> 01:26:00.018
I was in the neighborhood.

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.386
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.

01:26:04.491 --> 01:26:06.823
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.

01:26:06.926 --> 01:26:10.054
Oh, I know. The first lady.

01:26:10.163 --> 01:26:13.064
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.

01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:15.999
She showed me the blackmail photos.

01:26:19.172 --> 01:26:21.538
So where does that leave us?

01:26:21.641 --> 01:26:25.839
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.

01:26:25.945 --> 01:26:28.072
Yeah.

01:26:28.181 --> 01:26:31.617
You really are an idiot,
you know that?

01:26:31.718 --> 01:26:36.155
- You honestly thought that
this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.

01:26:36.256 --> 01:26:38.190
Well, that's practical.

01:26:38.291 --> 01:26:42.227
The prints belong
to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B...

01:26:42.328 --> 01:26:46.560
now works for the personal security service
for the president of Karjastan.

01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:49.100
I'm also showing confirmed intel
that this is the guy...

01:26:49.202 --> 01:26:51.534
<i>responsible for the Central Asian</i>
<i>pipeline attacks.</i>

01:26:51.638 --> 01:26:54.038
Confirmed intel on what,
Agent Marin?

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:57.439
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.

01:26:57.544 --> 01:27:00.206
- Yeah. Whatever.
- Thank you.

01:27:00.313 --> 01:27:03.544
These people have the financial
and intelligence resources to pull this off.

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:06.312
All right, let's get going.

01:27:09.322 --> 01:27:11.222
We've still gotta find the mole.

01:27:11.324 --> 01:27:13.792
We polygraphed every agent
with access to the president.

01:27:13.893 --> 01:27:16.020
Yours was the only one
that showed deception.

01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:19.257
We need to figure out
how the real traitor passed the test.

01:27:19.365 --> 01:27:20.992
Montrose had the list.

01:27:23.736 --> 01:27:26.705
You know I never guaranteed you success.

01:27:26.806 --> 01:27:28.706
Security's tighter than it's ever been.

01:27:28.808 --> 01:27:32.608
Routes, modes of transport,
they're all random now.

01:27:32.712 --> 01:27:35.010
<i>Yeah, but not random</i>
<i>to you, William.</i>

01:27:35.115 --> 01:27:40.644
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter
at Camp David, you could have put him there.

01:27:42.522 --> 01:27:45.616
<i>Now, you've been playing us</i>
<i>since the beginning.</i>

01:27:45.725 --> 01:27:48.421
<i>All right. Fair enough.</i>

01:27:48.528 --> 01:27:51.361
That's not gonna work anymore.

01:27:51.464 --> 01:27:54.763
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.

01:27:54.868 --> 01:27:57.837
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B.,
which doesn't even exist anymore.

01:27:57.937 --> 01:28:00.497
Do you want out, William?

01:28:06.713 --> 01:28:09.978
Then give me... the president.

01:28:10.083 --> 01:28:12.176
<i>Just like you agreed.</i>

01:28:12.285 --> 01:28:14.253
No.

01:28:16.389 --> 01:28:18.357
I don't care.

01:28:19.492 --> 01:28:21.483
Expose me.

01:28:21.594 --> 01:28:25.428
I don't care if I spend the rest
of my life in prison for treason.

01:28:25.532 --> 01:28:28.126
I don't care if you kill me.

01:28:30.803 --> 01:28:34.364
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.

01:28:38.411 --> 01:28:41.209
Oh. Thank you.

01:28:42.549 --> 01:28:45.985
William...

01:28:46.085 --> 01:28:49.054
if you don't do this,
we're not gonna kill you.

01:28:56.963 --> 01:28:59.727
We are going to kill her.

01:29:03.803 --> 01:29:06.067
And we're gonna kill her.

01:29:08.107 --> 01:29:10.075
And then we're gonna kill her.

01:29:20.887 --> 01:29:23.879
<i>Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.</i>

01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:26.458
<i>But we're still here.</i>

01:29:29.295 --> 01:29:31.855
<i>William, it's all right.</i>

01:29:31.965 --> 01:29:34.525
You do have a way out.

01:29:34.634 --> 01:29:36.602
But only one.

01:29:44.043 --> 01:29:47.069
When he finishes his speech,
you take him on the primary route...

01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:49.876
to the "B" motorcade
under the plaza...

01:29:49.983 --> 01:29:52.315
and you take the radios out.

01:29:54.187 --> 01:29:57.987
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.

01:30:00.893 --> 01:30:03.054
Hey, look.

01:30:06.466 --> 01:30:08.491
You can keep those.

01:30:08.601 --> 01:30:10.796
I got doubles.

01:30:18.344 --> 01:30:22.337
Jill, it's David. I want you to get
in touch with Downing and Medina.

01:30:22.448 --> 01:30:26.248
Confirm for me which one did
Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.

01:30:26.352 --> 01:30:29.913
<i>- We're on our way to city hall.</i>
<i>- Got it.</i>

01:30:37.263 --> 01:30:39.925
<i>Command Post from Apache follow-up.</i>

01:30:40.033 --> 01:30:42.593
<i>Arrive Martinez location</i>
<i>1740 hours. Copy.</i>

01:30:42.702 --> 01:30:45.432
<i>Summon security, DiPaola.</i>
<i>Cincinnati's moving to hold.</i>

01:30:45.538 --> 01:30:48.302
<i>All posts, all posts, be advised.</i>
<i>We have an arrival.</i>

01:30:48.408 --> 01:30:52.310
<i>Only essential traffic at this time.</i>

01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:59.550
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:59.652 --> 01:31:02.621
Let's do this.

01:31:02.722 --> 01:31:05.020
Yeah, tell me what you got.

01:31:05.124 --> 01:31:09.060
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?

01:31:09.162 --> 01:31:13.360
Positive. Polygraphers have no record
of Montrose even being tested.

01:31:13.466 --> 01:31:16.128
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.

01:31:24.577 --> 01:31:27.978
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...

01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:30.379
America must be strong.

01:31:30.483 --> 01:31:32.383
But previous administrations-

01:31:32.485 --> 01:31:34.953
I also hacked into
Merriweather's staff mail.

01:31:35.054 --> 01:31:37.545
He was streaming
someone's offshore phone logs.

01:31:37.657 --> 01:31:40.148
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.

01:31:40.259 --> 01:31:42.090
Hi, Jill. It's Pete.

01:31:42.195 --> 01:31:45.722
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her-
only her- that it's Montrose.

01:31:45.832 --> 01:31:48.323
Got it.

01:31:48.434 --> 01:31:52.029
Jesus Christ, Pete. The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?

01:31:52.138 --> 01:31:55.437
I never saw it coming, Dave.

01:32:25.571 --> 01:32:30.372
<i> Be advised,</i>
<i>they just allowed two armed credentialed...</i>

01:32:30.476 --> 01:32:32.808
<i>American agents into the three perimeter</i>
<i>from checkpoint 386.</i>

01:32:32.912 --> 01:32:36.905
<i> Be advised,</i>
<i>suspect Garrison has just been let through-</i>

01:32:37.016 --> 01:32:39.075
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.

01:32:39.185 --> 01:32:41.085
<i>Ah, Jesus! I got Garrison</i>
<i>through the three.</i>

01:32:41.187 --> 01:32:44.953
<i> This resolution</i>
<i>cannot function alone. It is designed-</i>

01:32:45.057 --> 01:32:48.151
It's Garrison and Breck.

01:32:48.261 --> 01:32:50.991
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!

01:32:51.097 --> 01:32:54.658
<i>I'm Agent Breckinridge.</i>
<i>I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.</i>

01:32:54.767 --> 01:32:57.065
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?

01:32:57.170 --> 01:33:00.799
<i>We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.</i>

01:33:00.907 --> 01:33:05.310
- We must embrace the ideal
of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.

01:33:07.914 --> 01:33:10.644
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:12.911
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.

01:33:13.019 --> 01:33:14.577
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!

01:33:14.687 --> 01:33:16.587
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?

01:33:16.689 --> 01:33:18.884
What's the procedure for that?

01:33:21.227 --> 01:33:24.196
<i> No unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>beyond the two perimeter.</i>

01:33:24.297 --> 01:33:26.265
Ma'am.

01:33:28.968 --> 01:33:31.528
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.

01:33:31.637 --> 01:33:33.935
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.270
<i>- I'm not hearing any chatter.</i>
- I've got silence on all channels.

01:33:36.375 --> 01:33:39.037
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.

01:33:39.145 --> 01:33:42.444
He wanted me to tell you
that Montrose is the mole.

01:33:44.517 --> 01:33:49.113
<i> But I strongly believe</i>
<i>that we can protect our vital interests...</i>

01:33:49.222 --> 01:33:51.816
<i>without causing resentment.</i>

01:33:51.924 --> 01:33:54.620
Get your hands in the air!

01:33:54.727 --> 01:33:58.288
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!

01:33:58.397 --> 01:34:00.991
<i>- You are a Do Not Admit!</i>
- But at the same time-

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:04.501
- Mr. President.
<i>- Listen to me!</i>

01:34:04.604 --> 01:34:07.334
<i>Do not let him</i>
<i>move the president!</i>

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.408
This way, Mr. President.

01:34:09.509 --> 01:34:12.239
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!

01:34:12.345 --> 01:34:15.212
Crystal. Crystal is the password.

01:34:18.417 --> 01:34:21.215
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.

01:34:25.658 --> 01:34:28.149
It's all right.

01:34:28.261 --> 01:34:32.254
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?

01:34:32.365 --> 01:34:35.562
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.

01:34:39.672 --> 01:34:41.731
This way.

01:34:46.045 --> 01:34:49.572
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?

01:34:49.682 --> 01:34:52.674
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.

01:34:56.556 --> 01:34:59.024
That's a hell of a way
to leave the G8.

01:34:59.125 --> 01:35:02.959
<i>What is going on</i>
<i>with these goddamn radios?</i>

01:35:11.037 --> 01:35:13.733
Go in twos.

01:35:18.077 --> 01:35:21.740
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?

01:35:21.847 --> 01:35:24.645
<i>- What's next?</i>
- Bill?

01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:27.810
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.

01:35:38.564 --> 01:35:40.896
Crystal!

01:35:43.636 --> 01:35:47.231
<i> Pete, we're cut off</i>
<i>from the "B" motorcade.</i>

01:36:12.131 --> 01:36:15.032
You okay?

01:36:15.134 --> 01:36:17.034
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.

01:36:17.136 --> 01:36:19.127
What?

01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:23.106
Your locator, turn it off. That's how
they know where we are. They're tracking us.

01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:27.111
How do you-
How do you know?

01:36:30.249 --> 01:36:33.878
Oh, no, Bill. Oh, God.

01:36:52.905 --> 01:36:55.601
<i>Montrose was-</i>

01:37:20.866 --> 01:37:23.733
<i>Pete. Pete.</i>

01:37:23.836 --> 01:37:26.566
My family. My family. Pete!

01:37:31.577 --> 01:37:34.045
Mr. President,
you're gonna have to trust us.

01:37:34.146 --> 01:37:36.671
<i>We're gonna get you</i>
<i>up top to an evac car.</i>

01:37:56.469 --> 01:37:59.495
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high. You go low. You ready?

01:37:59.605 --> 01:38:01.436
- Yeah.
<i>- Go.</i>

01:38:10.716 --> 01:38:13.776
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.

01:38:30.436 --> 01:38:33.428
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.

01:38:33.539 --> 01:38:36.064
Yes. Garrison.

01:38:36.175 --> 01:38:39.110
<i>Need a hard car for</i>
<i>the president at southwest two.</i>

01:38:39.211 --> 01:38:41.441
Coming to you, Pete.
Go. Go! Go, go!

01:38:41.547 --> 01:38:43.947
<i>Southwest stairs.</i>
<i>Let's go get 'em!</i>

01:38:44.049 --> 01:38:46.244
All right, we're gonna
get you out of here.

01:39:39.638 --> 01:39:43.665
<i>Give me a perimeter</i>
<i>10 meters, 360 degrees!</i>

01:39:57.489 --> 01:39:59.650
<i>President's hard car!</i>
<i>Let's get him in!</i>

01:39:59.758 --> 01:40:03.558
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.

01:40:21.881 --> 01:40:24.247
<i>The president is away!</i>

01:40:31.056 --> 01:40:32.853
Go, go, go, go!

01:40:36.729 --> 01:40:40.631
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

01:40:46.071 --> 01:40:48.904
<i>- Secure the first lady!</i>
<i>- We need a hard car, now!</i>

01:41:18.504 --> 01:41:20.563
Carl.

01:41:20.673 --> 01:41:23.642
Listen, Pete, um-

01:41:26.679 --> 01:41:28.579
You take care of yourself.

01:41:31.050 --> 01:41:33.177
I'll save you a tee time.

01:41:35.621 --> 01:41:38.488
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.

01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:40.490
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

01:41:40.592 --> 01:41:43.925
I'll see you guys. Good careers.

01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:46.554
Take care.

01:41:46.665 --> 01:41:48.792
Do well, guys. See you soon.

01:41:48.901 --> 01:41:51.836
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?

01:41:53.205 --> 01:41:55.696
This could be trouble.

01:41:55.808 --> 01:42:00.472
- I'm gonna walk out of the
White House carrying this?

01:42:00.579 --> 01:42:03.548
Thanks, guys.

01:42:04.883 --> 01:42:07.545
- Bye-bye. All the best.
<i>- Hey, Pete!</i>

01:42:07.653 --> 01:42:09.678
You gonna leave
without saying good-bye?

01:42:09.788 --> 01:42:12.222
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.

01:42:12.324 --> 01:42:14.315
Thanks.

01:42:14.426 --> 01:42:16.519
So, how about
a little retirement dinner tonight?

01:42:16.628 --> 01:42:19.392
I can't. I got a date.

01:42:19.498 --> 01:42:22.831
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.

01:42:22.935 --> 01:42:25.028
That's great.

01:42:25.137 --> 01:42:28.129
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:30.834
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.

01:42:33.846 --> 01:42:36.474
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.

01:42:36.582 --> 01:42:39.142
It's gonna miss you too.

01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:45.319
Take care.
