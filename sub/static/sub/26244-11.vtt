14:47.511 --> 14:48.345
Mm.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.853
That was
the most satisfying meal I've ever had.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.771
Now, come on,
we've already been here too long.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.024
Mum must be losing her mind by now.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.401
[grunting]

15:03.193 --> 15:05.863
[Wood Man laughs]
City life has made you weak.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.240
Oh, it's not that.
It's stuck.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.825
[Wood Man sighs]

15:12.453 --> 15:14.914
[grunting]

15:14.997 --> 15:15.998
What is going on?

15:20.044 --> 15:21.086
[Wood Man grunts]

15:21.837 --> 15:24.590
Well, that's generally
not how windows work.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.633
Upstairs.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.719
Maybe we can get out through the attic.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.763
[Wood Man] I guess it's worth a shot.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.771
I don't think
this house wants us to leave.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.315
Do you think that's why it tried
to make us so comfortable,

16:23.399 --> 16:26.610
with the tea, the music, the food?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.326
[Alfur] Oh, she's not here!

16:34.410 --> 16:37.496
Well, that was six hours
of reckless gambling for nothing.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.622
[thudding footstep]

16:38.706 --> 16:41.208
More thieves? Come on!

16:43.544 --> 16:46.213
Lead me to your blue-haired friend.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.631
[Twig whining]

16:47.715 --> 16:51.677
Oh! [chuckles] How ironic.
That's what we were hoping you would do.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.346
-[roaring]
-[Alfur grunting]

16:57.266 --> 17:00.769
[Alfur shouting]

17:07.234 --> 17:08.986
Raven! You're here!

17:09.069 --> 17:12.197
I know! What a peculiar coincidence.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.950
Oh, unless you're also searching
for Hilda.

17:15.034 --> 17:15.868
[thudding footstep]

17:15.951 --> 17:17.453
I knew it!

17:18.704 --> 17:20.581
You're with that blue-haired girl.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.541
Well, you-- You...

17:24.418 --> 17:26.211
are free to go.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.176
[Alfur] Any idea where to look next?

17:32.259 --> 17:34.261
That giant was our last lead.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.471
Mine, too.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.806
-[Twig whining]
-Oh.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.641
Good idea, Twig.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.395
[Wood Man] Book. Cushion.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.606
White cowboy hat.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.359
Could you please stop doing that?
It's quite distracting.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.861
[Wood Man] We're stuck here.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.073
We might as well
take advantage of the situation.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.825
There must be something you need.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.953
Well, I did promise a friend
I'd find her missing book.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.622
A ghost stole it, I think.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.791
[Wood Man] You lead a peculiar life.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.043
[gasps] This is it!

18:06.126 --> 18:07.377
This is the book!

18:07.461 --> 18:09.755
But if I can't get out of here
and return it to Frida,

18:09.838 --> 18:11.381
there's really no point.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.593
[Wood Man] Good deeds are overrated.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.636
Tea cake?

18:15.719 --> 18:17.304
I don't want any treats!

18:17.387 --> 18:19.431
I want to see my friends and family.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.225
[knocking at door]

18:22.476 --> 18:25.646
-[knocking continues]
-Um, sorry, we're not able to open--

18:26.563 --> 18:28.065
Twig! Raven!

18:28.148 --> 18:29.483
And Alfur!

18:29.566 --> 18:31.443
[Twig panting]

18:31.985 --> 18:34.196
Wait! Don't let it close the...

18:34.279 --> 18:35.447
door.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.533
[sighs] I'll explain.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.869
[Alfur] How peculiar.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.455
-Anything you want?
-[Wood Man] Seems that way.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.917
Personally, I don't see what the fuss is.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.379
You weren't that excited
to get back to Trolberg anyway.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.965
And there are worse places
to spend your days

18:53.048 --> 18:56.593
than a magical house
that fulfills your every desire.

18:56.677 --> 19:01.682
So, all I have to do
is ask for a blank notebook?

19:01.765 --> 19:03.350
Oh! [laughing]

19:03.433 --> 19:05.811
Or, say, something shiny?

19:06.478 --> 19:07.604
Ooh!

19:07.688 --> 19:10.607
[Wood Man] I don't think
you even have to say it.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.151
[grunts]

19:12.901 --> 19:13.735
See?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.447
[laughing]

19:19.700 --> 19:20.534
Wow!

19:20.617 --> 19:21.493
[sniffing]

19:21.577 --> 19:23.245
[growling]

19:23.829 --> 19:26.039
-[whimpers]
-You get it, Twig.

19:26.123 --> 19:30.335
It doesn't matter if you give me books
about trolls, new colored pencils,

19:30.419 --> 19:33.881
cucumber sandwiches,
or all my favorite things!

19:33.964 --> 19:36.008
You will never be my home!

19:38.051 --> 19:38.927
Wait a minute.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.558
Everybody, request more things.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.060
It doesn't matter what,
just do it as quickly as you can.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.770
Oh, I wouldn't wanna be greedy.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.938
Just trust me.

19:57.821 --> 19:58.822
It's working!

19:58.906 --> 20:00.991
The house is having trouble keeping up.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.868
Wood Man, we need your help.

20:02.951 --> 20:06.246
[Wood Man] Just a moment. I'm trying
to picture the perfect end table.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.665
[grunts]

20:08.749 --> 20:11.418
[Wood Man] Hmm.
The grain could be better.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.046
Please, get with the spirit
of the exercise.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.505
[Wood Man] Fine, fine.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.890
Hilda, I'm having trouble
thinking of more things to want.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.808
Ah! Me, too!

20:26.892 --> 20:29.811
Simplicity has always been
one of my virtues.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.729
-Ah!
-[thuds]

20:32.022 --> 20:33.690
Come on!
Don't stop now.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.609
We've almost defeated it.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.320
Just ask for, I don't know,
a diamond monocle.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.072
[Wood Man] Already did.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.617
Oh, look, you selfish house!

20:43.700 --> 20:45.953
All I really want is a way home!

20:53.961 --> 20:54.795
[gasps]

20:56.797 --> 20:58.048
That's new.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.219
Oh!

21:05.472 --> 21:06.723
It worked.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.477
But is this really your house
or just another trick?

21:11.812 --> 21:12.771
Hilda!

21:12.854 --> 21:13.981
Mum!

21:14.064 --> 21:15.899
[exhales] We're really home!

21:15.983 --> 21:16.817
[laughs]

21:16.900 --> 21:18.944
I was so worried about you.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.697
I'm so sorry. I came as soon as I could.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.200
There were... complications.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.995
[Wood Man] Still,
seems everything worked out.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.248
I guess it did.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.425
[Wood Man grunts]

21:42.301 --> 21:44.845
Eh, I wanted it in mahogany anyhow.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.179
[zaps]

21:51.226 --> 21:53.186
What-- What just happened?

21:53.270 --> 21:57.190
Well, the simplest version is
I just wished to be home...

21:58.066 --> 21:59.818
and I ended up here.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.030
I guess Trolberg is my home now.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.994
[Wood Man] Well, obviously.

22:09.619 --> 22:10.996
For now anyway.

22:11.079 --> 22:13.915
And someday your home
may be somewhere else.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.879
But that doesn't mean
you leave your other homes behind.

22:18.962 --> 22:22.466
The wilderness will always be
a part of who you are.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.761
-That's why we're such good friends.
-We are?

22:25.844 --> 22:28.305
Repeating myself makes me anxious.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.974
I'll stop by next time I'm in town.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.018
Make sure you do the same.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.395
Just walk on in.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.278
[folk music playing]

22:43.362 --> 22:46.406
[man whistling tune]
