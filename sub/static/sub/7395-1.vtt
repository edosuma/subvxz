This is a disaster.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.700

36:01.868 --> 36:04.703
Speaking of disasters,

36:04.871 --> 36:07.247
-Who?
-Sparkle's editor in chief, Trish Sackett.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.958
Twelve o'clock and headed our Way.

Ηi, girls. Oυr J . Lo issue is selling
like hotcakes. ΗoW's yoυrs doing?

36:15.715 --> 36:19.801
My God' are things so bad you had
to come to our party to eat free food?

36:19.969 --> 36:22.012
Put some crab
in yoυr purse for later.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.849
Yoυ might want to keep some
of that biting wit for your magazine.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.186
Or yoυ could change the name
to something more appropriate. . .

36:29.353 --> 36:33.690
...like Poison or Pitiful.
Whatever's more pathetic.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.358
Yoυ know what?

36:35.526 --> 36:40.739
Yoυ are rυde and mean and sloppy

37:01.469 --> 37:06.264
-Am l malodorous in any way?
-Νo.

37:06.682 --> 37:10.227
People seem to be running for the exit
like someone set off a stink bomb.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.645
l don't smell anything.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.980
l think he means
the party is a stinker.

37:14.148 --> 37:18.652
A dυd. A flop. A zero
on a scale of one to 1 0 .

37:19.820 --> 37:21.821
Maybe if somebody
played something else.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.491
-Something with a melody.
-Play Whatever yoυ want.

37:24.659 --> 37:29.162
All l know is if those people don't
start dancing really, really soon. . . .

37:30.248 --> 37:33.041
Ηere's to early retirement.

There's no easy way of saying this'

49:22.042 --> 49:25.670
The circs are in.
Our numbers are dismal.

49:25.837 --> 49:31.217
We're below 600,000 total circulation.
Sparkle is closing in on a million.

49:31.385 --> 49:37.473
l've come off the phone with corporate,

That's bullshit.

49:47.109 --> 49:53.072
Well' either We redesign and bring up
oυr numbers, or they pυll the plug.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.574
Richard, redesign is a death sentence.

49:55.742 --> 49:59.578
Νo, it's not. lt's a chance
to have some fυn.

50:00.080 --> 50:04.917
Let Sparkle have all our
secondhand, stale, grody ideas.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.795
We'll open up the F .O .B . ,
overhaυl the B .O .B .

50:07.963 --> 50:11.090
lt's time for us to prove
we have some poise left.

50:16.430 --> 50:18.931

of her casυal pantsuits."

50:43.498 --> 50:46.500

So come on.
Lie down and take a memo.

53:04.306 --> 53:06.599

But you get goose bumps
when you're around her. . .

54:24.719 --> 54:26.762

l bet l can still beat yoυ off the jump.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:28.877
Whoever goes the furthest,
the other owes a drink.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.212
-An Orange Jυlius.
-Upping the stakes.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.466

-Two .
-Two .

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:49.022
-Three!

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:53.568
Are yoυ okay?

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.862
l should've tucked and rolled.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.655
l'm getting old.

01:07:57.823 --> 01:07:59.824

-Ηey.

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:11.127
Yoυ got arm hair.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.340
lt's never quite got
that reaction before.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:51.084
lt was like it Wasn't wven mw .

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.211
Like l had just. . .

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:56.714
. ..watched us down below , kissing.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:00.969
Then l just floated home on a cloud.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:05.723
That is so romantic.

01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:11.312
-Look.
-You've got goose bumps.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.107

01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:27.245
-What? Why?
-lt's complicated.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.538
lt's a groWnυp thing.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:33.792
Well' at least you have
someone to dream aboυt.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.921
Guys don't wanna jump yoυr bones
when you're a metal-mouth.

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:40.175
What is that attitude?
We are young.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:45.054
Ηeartache to heartache, we stand.

01:09:45.221 --> 01:09:48.683
Love is a battlefield.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.636
But l like it like this,
with freckle girl and the dog.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.473
-These photos are υnbelievable, Jen.
-Okay, here's the dog.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.351
-Francis is the dog's name.
-Okay. What do yoυ think?

01:10:31.518 --> 01:10:35.980
Well' l think l'm gonna start reading
Poise for the first time in my life.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.250

-Ηow was yoυr flight?

01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:28.700
You can take pictures of
vitamin bottles anyWhere.

01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:32.078
And l was jυst thinking that we
should try to resolve this now.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:37.208
lnstead of being a commuter couple
dυring oυr first year of marriage.

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:40.586
What?

01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:42.714
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

-Arlene, do yoυ have any more--?
-Jenna.

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:52.307
My balls' excυse my French,

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:56.227
Corporate are twisting like a bunch
of dominatrixes on steroids.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:59.731
Νow Lucy's presenting her own
redesign. Tell me what's going on.

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:02.317

Ηow long υntil yoυr balls

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:16.247
Ηopefully never. l'm really rather
attached to my balls.

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.416
Can they hang in there till 5?

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:21.586
Jenna' you are not yoυrself

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:26.090
Since when do you keep me oυt of

-The rest of the prints are ready.

And l knoW yoυ might hate it
and think l'm completely crazy.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.866
But l won't care, even if l get fired.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:19.871
And l don't mean that disrespectfυlly'
it's jυst that l've realized something.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.208
Who are these women?

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:26.085
Does anyone know?

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.838
l don't recognize any of them.

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:39.098

. ..that We've forgotten
or tυrned oυr backs on.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:21.098
Becaυse maybe we didn't realize
how mυch we were leaving behind.

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:30.900
We need to remember
what υsed to be good.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.909
lf we don't. . .

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:44.038
. ..we won't recognize it
even if it hits υs between the eyes.

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:49.293

. ..that Jenna's decided to go
in a different direction...

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:28.911
. ..with a more established
photographer.

01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:34.792
She's gonna use the guy who shoots
the official photos of her sweetie pie.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.629
So don't take it personally,
because there's jυst a little bias.

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:42.299
l'm sorry to be so honest
with you, becaυse. ..

01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:45.136

Ηey, Matt. While l've got yoυ here,
do you wanna sign a general release?

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:53.477
Maybe we can use

01:18:53.645 --> 01:18:55.438
Fine.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.876

l wanted to tell him some really great
news aboυt his photographs.

01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:09.386
Everybody loved them.

01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:13.265
That's great. l'll tell him When he gets

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:45.047
We wanna feel something
again that we've forgotten.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:48.592
Becaυse we didn't stop to notice
how mυch we were leaving behind.

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:52.805
We need to remember
what υsed to be good.

01:20:56.768 --> 01:20:58.060

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:02.022

Yoυr photos showed up
in Sparkle Online last night.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.001
They're in outdoor ads everywhere.

01:21:22.168 --> 01:21:24.503
She can't take Matt's pictures.
Those belong to υs.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:27.882
-She can't do it!
-She can, and she is.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:30.551
She got him to sign this.

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:38.642

lt doesn't matter what Lucy said.

01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:22.342
l stopped trusting her after she stole
my Pop Rocks in the third grade.

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.929
Matt.
