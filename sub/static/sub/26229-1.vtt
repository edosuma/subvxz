<i>It was always
full of love and chaos.</i>

03:07.744 --> 03:09.843
<i>But delicious chaos.</i>

03:09.845 --> 03:13.014
Okay! I got one large pepperoni,
two regular slices...

03:13.016 --> 03:14.648
<i>Our fathers
were best friends.</i>

03:14.650 --> 03:16.651
<i>Sometimes.</i>

03:18.855 --> 03:19.553
<i>See the good-looking
guy there, tasting the sauce?</i>

03:19.555 --> 03:22.657
<i>That's my pa, Salvatore Angioli,</i>

03:22.659 --> 03:24.559
<i>the maestro of marinara.</i>

03:24.561 --> 03:27.495
<i>And the guy spinning?
My pa, Vincenzo Campoli,</i>

03:27.497 --> 03:30.199
- <i>the don of dough.</i>
- <i>Really? "The don"?</i>

03:30.201 --> 03:32.134
- <i>That is such a stereotype.</i>
- <i>No, no. It's poetic.</i>

03:32.136 --> 03:34.937
Hey, Vince! How do you get your
crust to be so thin and crispy?

03:34.939 --> 03:36.808
Well, Mikey,
that's a family secret.

03:37.741 --> 03:38.773
And the secret is,

03:38.775 --> 03:40.478
two teaspoons of nunya!

03:41.179 --> 03:42.844
"Nunya"? What's nunya?

03:42.846 --> 03:45.748
It's nunya business, Mikey!

03:48.954 --> 03:51.220
Hey, Mikey, what about my
mother's special sauce?

03:51.222 --> 03:54.559
- Huh?
- Mama Angi, what's your secret?

03:54.859 --> 03:56.726
Every time I make the sauce,

03:56.728 --> 03:58.698
I say three Hail Mary.

03:59.764 --> 04:01.498
- I love that woman.
- Ha-ha! See? From God above

04:01.500 --> 04:05.167

- All right?
- Not in front of the kids.

04:19.918 --> 04:21.151
How do you think
the kids got here?

04:21.153 --> 04:22.752
Well, I know that,
but they don't know that.

04:22.754 --> 04:23.853
<i>My parents.</i>

04:23.855 --> 04:26.089

<i>And so did they.</i>

04:29.596 --> 04:30.627
That's enough.

04:30.629 --> 04:33.231

04:33.233 --> 04:34.201
- I won.
- I let her.

04:34.701 --> 04:36.535
- Did not.
- Did, too.

04:36.537 --> 04:40.205
- Go get clean.
- My daughter's a champion goalie!

04:40.207 --> 04:41.907
Yeah, and her father
won't stop bragging about it.

04:41.909 --> 04:43.140
Ah, shut up.

04:43.142 --> 04:45.910
- Nah, you shut up.
- Hey, Leo. Leo.

04:45.912 --> 04:47.779
Go see Nonno
make the dough. Leo!

04:47.781 --> 04:49.551

- It was Nikki.

04:49.916 --> 04:51.816
- Why did he say that?
- Leo, wash your hands.

04:51.818 --> 04:52.686
Okay, Nonno.

04:56.089 --> 04:57.756
Don't skimp on the cheese.
Don't skimp!

04:57.758 --> 04:58.760
Take a shot at it.

05:00.562 --> 05:02.198
Gently. Gentle.

05:03.797 --> 05:05.230
The thing is
you gotta treat it like

thank me for that.

05:11.805 --> 05:13.572
<i>Too bad he didn't
pass it along.</i>

05:13.574 --> 05:15.810

05:17.078 --> 05:18.610
like it was the last...

05:18.612 --> 05:20.747
No! Too... too... too hard.
Too hard.

05:20.749 --> 05:21.784
You can't force love.

05:23.184 --> 05:25.889
Never squeeze the love
out of a man's heart.

05:26.589 --> 05:29.659
If he don't give it freely,
you don't want it.

- Thank you.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
Come on, pal.
I'll buy you a beer at Luigi's.

Oh, no. No, Sal. Tomorrow.
The contest is tomorrow.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.168
- we're unbeatable!
- Our husbands, huh?

06:13.170 --> 06:15.873
- Like an old married couple.
- Which one wears the pants?

06:16.240 --> 06:18.640
- We do.
- I heard that.

06:18.642 --> 06:21.077
I'm going to church
to light a candle for the boys.

06:21.079 --> 06:22.844
Thank you, Ma.

06:22.846 --> 06:27.149
- A winning candle.

- <i>Grazie.</i>

06:31.923 --> 06:33.322
<i>Life was perfect.</i>

06:33.324 --> 06:35.895
<i>And our families
were inseparable.</i>

06:36.227 --> 06:38.862
<i>I mean, how could a bond
this strong ever be broken?</i>

06:38.864 --> 06:40.198
<i>I have no idea!</i>

06:40.799 --> 06:42.198
<i>But... that was then.</i>

06:52.243 --> 06:55.044
- <i>Hey, wait a minute!</i>
- <i>Okay, we'll get to that later.</i>

06:55.046 --> 06:56.847
<i>Actually, I went
to learn how to cook...</i>

06:56.849 --> 07:00.384
<i>like, four Michelin stars cook,
from the Chef Corrine.</i>

07:00.386 --> 07:03.387
<i>Picture Gordon Ramsay
but prettier.</i>

07:03.389 --> 07:06.290
The only thing sharper than
your knives are your senses.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.928
Anything less than perfection
is what?

07:08.228 --> 07:10.598
- Failure, Chef.
- <i>And scarier.</i>

07:12.999 --> 07:14.298
Limp,

07:14.300 --> 07:15.867
like my last husband.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.214
Oil is a garnish.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.818
You've used so much, the US
Army will invade the plate.

07:33.354 --> 07:35.820
- You are a what?
- Moron sandwich.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.125
- No. I can't hear you.
- Moron sandwich!

07:39.260 --> 07:40.260
Pathetic.

07:54.275 --> 07:56.276
Nicole. Gareth.

07:56.278 --> 07:58.648
Collect your things
and see me in my office.

07:59.448 --> 08:00.846
The rest of you,

08:00.848 --> 08:02.881
class is dismissed.
I expect everything

08:02.883 --> 08:05.321
- to be spotless in the morning.
- Yes, Chef.

08:09.424 --> 08:11.260
This'll be quick.
I'll get right to the point.

08:12.795 --> 08:14.794
I think you're both
done here now.

08:14.796 --> 08:16.430
- No, I can do better, Chef. Please.
- No, Chef! Please.

08:16.432 --> 08:18.435
Oh, stop whining, you ninnies!

08:19.435 --> 08:22.271
I'm opening up
a new place in Mayfair.

08:22.839 --> 08:24.839
Something millennial-friendly.

08:24.841 --> 08:27.474
Trendy, fast and very expensive.

08:27.476 --> 08:29.844
Well, that's the perfect
complement to your brand, Chef.

08:29.846 --> 08:31.415
Fast, casual.
It's brilliant, chef.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.684
Enough with the ass-kissing!

08:35.418 --> 08:38.321
I know you both would kill
to work there, so...

08:38.821 --> 08:40.323
I'm planning on hiring...

08:42.426 --> 08:43.294
one of you.

08:44.128 --> 08:45.961
You'll each have two weeks

08:45.963 --> 08:47.998
in which to come up
with a completely new menu.

08:48.931 --> 08:50.866
Wow me,

08:50.868 --> 08:53.304
then you and your winning menu
will be the toast of Mayfair.

08:55.873 --> 08:57.474
Don't just stand there
looking gobsmacked.

08:57.907 --> 08:59.207
You won't be disappointed, Chef.

08:59.209 --> 09:01.544
- Thank you.
- Oh, Nicole.

09:01.546 --> 09:04.012
If you want the job,
you're going to have

09:04.014 --> 09:06.181
to have your visa
changed from student

09:06.183 --> 09:08.885
- to work at once.
- Yes, Chef.

09:08.887 --> 09:11.219
And that means you're going
to have to go back to Canada.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.759
- I have to go home?
- Oh, I know. I feel your pain,

09:13.991 --> 09:16.027
but it'll only be
for a week or two.

09:16.293 --> 09:19.197
Oh, don't forget
to pack your mukluks,

09:19.496 --> 09:20.832
or whatnot.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.303
<i>Probably the last place
I wanted to go back to was...</i>

09:24.537 --> 09:26.306
<i>Little Italy.</i>

09:28.174 --> 09:29.976
<i>Our Little Italy.</i>

09:33.044 --> 09:34.880
- Hey, Carlo.
- Hey! <i>Ciao, ciao!</i>

09:37.382 --> 09:39.051
All right. You ready?

09:39.385 --> 09:41.417
In the net! There it is.

09:41.419 --> 09:44.189
All right, guys. I gotta take off.
I'll see you next week.

09:45.090 --> 09:46.889
<i>Where nothing changes.</i>

09:46.891 --> 09:49.059
- Hey, Bruno. What's up, man?
- Hey, Leo! Come on by.

09:49.061 --> 09:51.531
- Looks good this year.
- <i>And yet, everything is different.</i>

09:52.598 --> 09:55.200
<i>You see, our fathers,
they had a fight.</i>

09:55.202 --> 09:56.501
<i>A fight?
It was more like a war.</i>

09:56.503 --> 09:59.903
- <i>Yeah, a pizza war.</i>
- <i>My dad moved his shop...</i>

09:59.905 --> 10:02.273
<i>...all the way next door.</i>

10:02.275 --> 10:06.043
<i>And since then, our families haven't
exactly been on speaking terms.</i>

10:06.045 --> 10:08.446
<i>Technically.
They still swear at each other</i>

10:08.448 --> 10:10.881
- <i>with occasional hand gestures.</i>
- Hey, Leo.

10:10.883 --> 10:13.154
Hey there. You know, we deliver.

10:13.921 --> 10:15.223
I bet he does.

10:18.059 --> 10:19.560
<i>Disgrazia!</i>

10:21.061 --> 10:22.363
Again?

10:23.564 --> 10:25.029
Hey!

10:25.031 --> 10:27.399
Seriously?

10:27.401 --> 10:30.635
<i>And it all started the day that
they won the best pizza contest.</i>

10:30.637 --> 10:33.204
<i>And why they fought,
they've never said.</i>

10:33.206 --> 10:34.539
<i>Pop swears
he'll take it to the grave.</i>

10:34.541 --> 10:35.344
<i>Mine, too.</i>

10:41.649 --> 10:43.151
Hey! Hey!

10:43.619 --> 10:45.086
Hey.

10:45.586 --> 10:47.319
Leo.

10:47.321 --> 10:49.289
Hey, how come the only thing
my son's good at is being late?

10:49.291 --> 10:51.326
Miss Rossini asked me to help
her move some furniture.

10:52.094 --> 10:54.327
The bed? Or the couch?

10:54.329 --> 10:56.362
Or perhaps the kitchen table?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.030
Jogi!

10:58.032 --> 11:00.501
That is not our trash.

11:00.503 --> 11:03.440
You take that trash and you
throw it in the dumpster of...

11:04.139 --> 11:05.605
He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named!

11:05.607 --> 11:08.242
- You got it, Boss!
- Guy over there wants

11:08.244 --> 11:10.076
a pizza Margherita
with no sauce.

11:10.078 --> 11:12.613
No sauce? Why?
What's wrong with my sauce?

11:12.615 --> 11:14.147
Nothing. That's what he wants.

11:14.149 --> 11:16.416
Hey, you! Yeah, you!

11:16.418 --> 11:18.451
Four eyes! Why don't you
take your one good eye

11:18.453 --> 11:20.655
and go next door, look for
the naked pizza over there?

11:20.657 --> 11:22.455
Go to that <i>bottega,</i>
see what he gives you!

11:22.457 --> 11:24.593
His sauce is no good anyway,
you pervert!

11:24.595 --> 11:26.128
You want naked pizza?
Get out of here!

11:26.130 --> 11:28.029
Go on! Get out of here!

11:28.031 --> 11:31.266
<i>Che fai?</i> We're going broke and
you're yelling at the customers?

11:31.268 --> 11:32.871
You gotta get
with the times, Pa.

11:33.971 --> 11:36.437
I mean, people today,
they want some variety,

11:36.439 --> 11:38.139
health-conscious toppings

11:38.141 --> 11:40.575
or paper-thin, you know,
square slices.

11:40.577 --> 11:42.476
There's just so much
that we could do!

11:42.478 --> 11:44.178
Are you hearing this?

11:44.180 --> 11:46.316
Your grandson, he wants to make
square pizza for hippies.

11:46.549 --> 11:48.484
Hippies are back? I liked them.

11:48.486 --> 11:51.590
Those girls? They burn bras.

11:52.357 --> 11:54.657
No, not hippies.
Hipsters, Nonno.

11:54.659 --> 11:57.360
Millennials. And you know
what else wouldn't hurt?

11:57.362 --> 12:00.062
If we got online and like,
did an app or something.

12:00.064 --> 12:03.166
I mean, we gotta get business
flowing in here again like,

12:03.168 --> 12:05.000
you know, back in the good old
days when you and Sal...

12:05.002 --> 12:07.105
Hey! My vangina!

12:07.372 --> 12:09.706
- You said his name!
- Angina.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.945
And your heart is on this side.

12:12.578 --> 12:14.377
Nobody tells me
where my heart is.

12:14.379 --> 12:16.646
Excuse me.
Will my pizza be long?

12:16.648 --> 12:19.650
No. No. Your pizza
will be round,

12:19.652 --> 12:21.986
covered with sauce
and cheese on it.

12:21.988 --> 12:24.722
Welcome to Vince's!

12:24.724 --> 12:26.323
Come for the pizza,

12:26.325 --> 12:28.257
stay for the abuse.

12:28.259 --> 12:30.693
- I'm taking a walk.
- I'll join you.

12:30.695 --> 12:33.197
- I'm going to Sal's.
- Hey, hey! Leo, Leo!

12:33.199 --> 12:35.467
You gotta stay late tonight
'cause the place needs a cleanup.

12:35.469 --> 12:37.267
No, I can't, Pa.

12:37.269 --> 12:39.069
I gotta work
my shift at Luigi's.

12:39.071 --> 12:40.537
You ought to be working here,

12:40.539 --> 12:43.074
not tending bar over in that
dive for that Luigi character.

12:43.076 --> 12:44.244
He's no Neapolitan.

12:44.577 --> 12:46.644
Let's face it, Pa.
You can't pay me enough,

12:46.646 --> 12:49.046
and this way, I get free rent.
It's a win-win.

12:49.048 --> 12:51.616
Honey, you can come back home
any time you like.

12:51.618 --> 12:53.651
You just make sure
that those <i>puttanellis</i>

12:53.653 --> 12:55.388
don't climb through the window.
You know why?

12:55.589 --> 12:57.525
'Cause God
made you too gorgeous.

12:58.557 --> 13:00.358
I love you. I'll see you, Pa.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.594
- Where's that mouth been?
- Meh.

13:02.596 --> 13:04.195
That's your son.

13:04.197 --> 13:06.134
- My vangina.
- Agh!

13:07.769 --> 13:10.536
I don't know, Jogi. You
really think you're ready for this?

13:10.538 --> 13:13.104
Oh, yes, sir!
I am ready, Mr. Leo.

13:13.106 --> 13:17.542
I would give my left testicle
to deliver pizza Leo-style.

13:17.544 --> 13:18.743
All right.
I gotta warn you, though.

13:18.745 --> 13:20.448
The ladies at this address...

13:21.615 --> 13:23.249
- they're wild.
- Oh!

13:23.251 --> 13:25.585
Okay? So just promise me
you'll be careful, yeah?

13:25.587 --> 13:27.186
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- All right, here. Take it.

13:27.188 --> 13:28.622
Thank you, Mr. Leo!

13:28.624 --> 13:31.224
- Shh. Shh.
- Knock yourself out, yeah?

13:31.226 --> 13:34.097
Oh, I will be knocking.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.464
Hard! Heh-heh.

13:37.466 --> 13:38.634
Jogi!

13:39.834 --> 13:43.135
Next time I see you on Sal's territory,

13:43.137 --> 13:45.305
I'll squash you like
a malaria mosquito in Mumbai.

13:46.507 --> 13:48.676
They say Karma is a real bitch.

13:48.678 --> 13:50.610
Are the two of you related? Hmm?

13:50.612 --> 13:53.481
- Jessie, are you out?
- Coming, Boss!

13:53.483 --> 13:55.450
Just taking out the trash.

13:55.452 --> 13:57.217
Don't forget the trash
that comes out

13:57.219 --> 13:58.588
- of that mouth of yours!
- Hey! Get out!

13:59.656 --> 14:01.157
Take out the trash.

14:02.358 --> 14:04.694
Oof. Jessie, why does today's
sauce smell like cat puke?

14:06.195 --> 14:07.595
Curry powder.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.697
Jogi! Son of a bitch.

14:09.699 --> 14:12.333
That monster
messed with my mother's sauce.

14:12.335 --> 14:13.868
- We will get them, Boss.
- Okay.

14:13.870 --> 14:15.603
- What?
- All right.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.773
- Huh?
- You don't seem too upset,

14:17.775 --> 14:19.775
which must mean
you have worse planned.

14:19.777 --> 14:23.181
Honey, let's just say tomorrow
is gonna be a high holiday.

14:23.647 --> 14:25.179
Here's a fresh batch.

14:25.181 --> 14:26.682
- Mama!
- <i>Dio mio!</i>

14:26.684 --> 14:30.218
This is heavy.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.654
Your voice is no gift.

14:32.656 --> 14:34.389
You work too hard.

14:34.391 --> 14:37.160
Oh, but what, you think
the sauce make itself?

14:37.162 --> 14:38.895
Come on. Come with me.
I want you to rest.

14:38.897 --> 14:42.531
No. I'll rest when I'm dead.
Oh! Speaking of dead,

14:42.533 --> 14:44.700
this is our dinner crowd!

14:44.702 --> 14:47.402
It's been a slow day, Ma.

14:47.404 --> 14:49.738
My bowels are slow.
This is dead.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.407
I'm going to church
for some excitement.

14:52.409 --> 14:54.743
Okay. Listen. While you're
there, why don't you pray

14:54.745 --> 14:56.746
that the place next door
goes up in smoke?

14:56.748 --> 14:58.381
<i>Coglione!</i>

14:58.383 --> 15:01.188
Your evil will end!

15:02.420 --> 15:03.456
Sal's Pizza. It's better.

15:04.756 --> 15:05.756
What?

15:05.758 --> 15:07.861
You're kiddin' me! Oh, my God!

15:08.260 --> 15:09.859
- What?
- Oh. Shh!

15:09.861 --> 15:11.328
- What? What?
- Shh! Shh!

15:13.198 --> 15:14.598
Oh! Okay! It's Nikki!

15:14.600 --> 15:17.269
- What, Nikki? Nikki! Nik...
- No, she hung up!

15:19.804 --> 15:22.205
- Nikki is coming home tomorrow.
- Hey!

15:22.207 --> 15:23.642
Nikki's comin' home!

15:23.644 --> 15:25.844
Oh! Now, you listen to me.

15:25.846 --> 15:27.745
- What?
- My baby girl is comin' home

15:27.747 --> 15:29.246
for the first time
in five years.

15:29.248 --> 15:31.550
If you ruin it
with your <i>farkakte</i> feud...

15:31.552 --> 15:32.917
Oh, there it is! There it is.

15:32.919 --> 15:35.452
- What?
- What, my <i>"farkakte</i> feud"!

15:35.454 --> 15:37.621
- It's my fault she left.
- I'm not saying it's your f...

15:37.623 --> 15:39.724
- You just said it's my fault!
- I did not say it's your fault!

15:39.726 --> 15:41.692
- You...
- I don't wanna hear it!

15:46.265 --> 15:48.237
Get it while it's hot!

15:48.936 --> 15:51.470
Get it while it's hot!

15:51.472 --> 15:52.904
- Yoo-hoo!
- Oh!

15:52.906 --> 15:56.478
Ladies, please! One at a time!

16:04.886 --> 16:07.653
- Nikki? Oh, my God!
- Gina!

16:07.655 --> 16:09.621
- Oh, my God, it's you! Oh!
- Hi!

16:09.623 --> 16:11.757
Oh, my God! My girl's back!

16:12.927 --> 16:15.495
Look at you!

16:15.497 --> 16:16.896
You're all gorgeous!

16:16.898 --> 16:18.500
Okay. Where's the rest
of your luggage?

16:20.436 --> 16:23.270
Oh, my God. You're not staying.
Your family's gonna disown you.

16:23.272 --> 16:25.505
They haven't seen you
in like, five years!

16:25.507 --> 16:26.939
I know. I haven't told them yet.

16:26.941 --> 16:29.009
They think
I'm arriving tomorrow.

16:29.011 --> 16:31.245
I just, I need a drink
before I have that conversation.

16:31.247 --> 16:32.612
You need about 20.

16:32.614 --> 16:34.314
Listen, Joe's got the kids,

16:34.316 --> 16:36.220
we've got the whole night.

16:36.518 --> 16:39.487
- Luigi's? Really?
- Like the good old days!

16:42.491 --> 16:44.791
Oh! Look at what the cat
dragged in.

16:44.793 --> 16:49.696
- Oh!
- Wait 'til Luigi sees you.

16:49.698 --> 16:52.834
Oh, this <i>bambolina</i> made
me an offer I couldn't refuse,

16:52.836 --> 16:54.935
- so what's Luigi do?
- Hey, Luigi!

16:54.937 --> 16:57.537
Luigi takes care of business.
<i>Ciao, bella!</i>

You look so, uh...

17:05.714 --> 17:08.284
- Different?
- I was gonna say hot.

17:08.286 --> 17:09.654
Ay!

17:11.320 --> 17:13.989
Hey! <i>Bentornato!</i>

- You were seeing

an investment banker. So?

17:29.441 --> 17:31.540
He had a...

17:31.542 --> 17:34.544
sizeable portfolio,
but not a clue how to manage it.

17:34.546 --> 17:36.712
Hmm. I would've shown him
how to invest.

17:36.714 --> 17:39.949
I bet Englishmen can get you to do the
filthiest stuff with that accent.

17:39.951 --> 17:41.817
You'd be surprised

17:41.819 --> 17:43.489
how quickly
that novelty wears off.

17:44.423 --> 17:46.559
I hear they're big on oral.

20:21.886 --> 20:24.690
Did I just say that out loud?
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

20:28.993 --> 20:30.693
I mean...

20:30.695 --> 20:32.564
it's gonna be embarrassing...

20:33.565 --> 20:35.732
for you.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.567
<i>Andiamo!</i>

20:37.569 --> 20:39.504
To the field!

20:39.506 --> 20:42.172
Nikki versus Leo, the rematch!

20:42.174 --> 20:44.978
- It's gonna get messy, people!
- Woo!

20:45.912 --> 20:47.812
Okay. Listen up.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.082
Okay.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.218
Nikki blocks a shot,

20:51.718 --> 20:54.555
Leo does a shot! Hey!

20:55.087 --> 20:56.853
Leo scores,

20:56.855 --> 20:58.824
Nikki does a shot. Hey!

20:58.826 --> 21:00.858
You do realize that I coach

21:00.860 --> 21:02.928
the neighborhood
soccer team now?

21:02.930 --> 21:05.764
- That's a shame for those kids.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.099
Come on, Nikki!

21:11.105 --> 21:13.204
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

21:13.206 --> 21:15.874
How'd you stop that?

21:15.876 --> 21:17.776
- For you.
- Drink up!

21:17.778 --> 21:20.048
Come on, pizza boy!

21:21.815 --> 21:22.918
Shit!

21:23.117 --> 21:25.117
- Whoa!
- Oh-ho-ho!

21:25.119 --> 21:27.619
- Shot for Nikki!
- Joey Junior has diarrhea.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.288
I have to go. I'm so sorry.
I gotta go. All right.

21:29.290 --> 21:31.092
- Okay. Okay.
- Kids.

21:31.592 --> 21:32.892
Oh!

21:32.894 --> 21:35.561
- I wasn't ready!
- What kind of excuse is that?

21:35.563 --> 21:37.262

I can't do this anymore. You
two settle it on your own, okay?

22:15.805 --> 22:17.638
Just you and me now.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.842
All right. I'm calling

22:28.718 --> 22:29.853
Yeah, I let you.

- Yeah.

22:39.030 --> 22:40.832

- Yeah.

22:55.412 --> 22:57.679
Okay.

23:07.692 --> 23:08.927
Oh...

23:19.904 --> 23:22.642
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- <i>Buongiorno, bella</i> Nikki! Shh!

23:24.878 --> 23:26.045
You were amazing last night.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.047
- Luigi?
- You're so talented, you know.

23:30.049 --> 23:32.283
Hashtag skills, huh?

23:32.285 --> 23:35.186
No. No. No, no, no, no.
Good God, no!

23:35.188 --> 23:37.955
No, no, no, no. Come on.

23:37.957 --> 23:39.892
I just needed a clean pair
of junk trunks, huh?

23:53.708 --> 23:54.976
Good morning.

23:57.178 --> 23:58.046
Hi.

23:59.046 --> 23:59.913
Hangover?

24:01.815 --> 24:03.183
No, just jetlag.

24:05.419 --> 24:06.388
Yeah, me, too.

24:11.793 --> 24:13.927
So... we should

24:13.929 --> 24:15.096
probably talk about...

24:16.264 --> 24:18.734
- last night.
- Uh-huh.

24:19.401 --> 24:21.103
And what happened...

24:23.337 --> 24:24.272
It was one for the books, Nikki.

24:25.906 --> 24:27.372
Oh, my God.

24:27.374 --> 24:28.376
Yeah, you were
saying that a lot last night.

24:29.310 --> 24:30.008
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God. No. No.

24:30.010 --> 24:30.810
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

24:30.812 --> 24:32.978
My dad is gonna kill me.
I mean, I...

24:32.980 --> 24:35.015
Yeah, I think he's
gonna shoot me first.

24:35.017 --> 24:37.287
I slept with Vince's son!

24:37.987 --> 24:40.153
I'm... I'm joining a convent.

24:40.155 --> 24:42.158
After last night,
they're not gonna let you in.

24:46.394 --> 24:48.432
Relax. Eh, relax, <i>stupida.</i>

24:49.499 --> 24:50.931
Nothing happened.

24:50.933 --> 24:53.100
- Nothing?
- Nah, you passed out.

24:53.102 --> 24:54.468
I gave you my room

24:54.470 --> 24:56.937
to sleep it off
and I took the couch.

24:56.939 --> 24:58.539
Well, who took off my dress?

24:58.541 --> 25:00.174
Hey, listen.

25:00.176 --> 25:02.176
You had that on when I left you.

25:02.178 --> 25:03.912
What you did
with it after, that's

25:03.914 --> 25:05.148
none of my business.

25:12.222 --> 25:14.224
Uh, have you seen my...
my necklace?

25:15.192 --> 25:16.059
You left it.

25:18.194 --> 25:19.163
On my lap.

25:19.997 --> 25:21.065
What?

25:21.999 --> 25:23.202
I... I don't wanna know.

25:24.535 --> 25:25.737
Thank you.

25:33.578 --> 25:36.048
- What?
- You're very, uh...

25:39.184 --> 25:40.752
How'd you get to be so very?

25:41.051 --> 25:42.020
Kale.

25:42.954 --> 25:44.388
Ever heard of it, pizza boy?

25:45.056 --> 25:47.223
Kale, kale, kale, kale. I...

25:47.225 --> 25:50.460
- Where's your bathroom?
- Kale. Sounds vaguely familiar.

25:50.462 --> 25:52.895
Let me think.
Uh... it's a superfood.

25:52.897 --> 25:55.432
Part of the wild cabbage family.

25:55.434 --> 25:58.538
It's rich with antioxidants
and calcium.

26:09.915 --> 26:12.983
<i>So, look. My folks
think I'm arriving today.</i>

26:12.985 --> 26:15.156
<i>So... if I see you later...</i>

26:20.392 --> 26:21.194
I'll look surprised.

26:34.107 --> 26:35.110
Can you believe this?

26:36.977 --> 26:38.910
More dough, Carlo!

26:38.912 --> 26:41.582
It's about time we got some
life back in this place!

26:42.550 --> 26:45.086
- Like old times.
- Okay, ladies!

26:46.120 --> 26:49.420
Go, Jogi, go. <i>Jai ho, Slumdog!</i>

26:49.422 --> 26:51.924
How I regret giving you
that DVD for Christmas!

26:51.926 --> 26:54.426
Sausage and peppers, two large.

26:54.428 --> 26:56.561
Hey, that was my nickname
in the army!

26:57.931 --> 26:59.267
Whoa, whoa.

27:01.570 --> 27:04.404
Hey, this place
is really hopping!

27:04.406 --> 27:07.506
- Yeah. No thanks to you.
- Ah, come on, Pa!

27:07.508 --> 27:09.475
It's a beautiful day.
Enjoy it, would you?

27:09.477 --> 27:11.477
Hey, Jogi, you got that order
ready for the police department?

27:11.479 --> 27:13.513
- Like every Sunday.
- Good man.

27:13.515 --> 27:16.986
Oh, Leo!

27:17.185 --> 27:19.686
Guys, I'll be right with you.
Here you go, folks.

27:19.688 --> 27:21.521
- Enjoy!
- Hey, hey!

27:21.523 --> 27:22.892
Hey, Amalia!

27:24.626 --> 27:26.393
- Hi.
- Hi, it looks like you've got

27:26.395 --> 27:28.662
- a good crowd today.
- Nah, I guess we got lucky.

27:28.664 --> 27:30.163
Between you and me,

27:30.165 --> 27:32.034
our pizza today is delicious.

27:33.135 --> 27:34.701
Well, our side is so dead,

27:34.703 --> 27:37.638
Sal and I could have sex on the
table and no one would even notice.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.340
But you know what?
None of that matters.

27:39.342 --> 27:41.475
- Why?
- My Nikki's comin' home today!

27:41.477 --> 27:43.177
- What? That is fabulous!
- I know! I know! I'm so happy!

27:43.179 --> 27:44.445
Oh!

27:44.447 --> 27:45.579
Keep your pants on, would you?

27:45.581 --> 27:46.417
Come on, already!

27:48.518 --> 27:51.152
Now we just have to find her
a husband so she'll stay. Right?

27:51.154 --> 27:53.956
- Sure.
- Oh!

27:53.958 --> 27:55.660
- Honey, let's go!
- What? I'm comin'!

27:57.493 --> 27:59.460
If their mid-life crises
don't kill them...

27:59.462 --> 28:01.231
- We will.
- All right.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.032
How's your father-in-law?

28:04.034 --> 28:06.400
He's horny as a teenager on
prom night. Your mother-in-law?

28:06.402 --> 28:08.139
Oh, prudish as a nun
during lent.

28:09.038 --> 28:10.340
- Hey!
- Hey!

28:24.756 --> 28:26.022
Hi.

28:26.024 --> 28:27.660
Nicoletta!

28:29.126 --> 28:31.059
<i>La bella!</i>

28:35.201 --> 28:37.000
Already dressed for my funeral!

28:37.002 --> 28:39.737
Nonna, you're not going
anywhere. Don't say that.

28:39.739 --> 28:42.306
My next address is a tombstone.

28:42.308 --> 28:45.108
- No.
- You still wear it.

28:45.110 --> 28:48.479
- Yeah.
- Oh, Saint Antonio...

28:48.481 --> 28:51.081
patron saint
of wayward children.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.716
I knew he'd bring you home!

28:52.718 --> 28:55.654
Oh, <i>bella, bella, bella!</i>

28:56.555 --> 28:58.154
Salvatore!

28:58.156 --> 29:00.592
- <i>Nicoletta nella casa!</i>
- Honey! Honey, she's home!

29:00.594 --> 29:03.060
Oh, my beautiful girl!

29:03.062 --> 29:05.730
Oh, look! Look,
I hardly recognize you!

29:05.732 --> 29:07.664
Well, you would
if you learned to FaceTime.

29:07.666 --> 29:10.201
Hey, is that what the boys
show their <i>cazzo</i> on?

29:10.203 --> 29:12.069
- Hi, Mama.
- Hug me!

29:12.071 --> 29:15.406
My baby. My baby!
Oh. You're so thin!

29:15.408 --> 29:17.275
- What happened to her ass?
- I don't know!

29:17.277 --> 29:20.444
- No one trusts a skinny cook, baby!
- She'll get you another one.

29:20.446 --> 29:22.414
- Eat, baby. Eat!
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:22.416 --> 29:23.715
- Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm okay.
- Just a little bite.

29:23.717 --> 29:25.483
- You just got home!
- A little bite! Little bite!

29:25.485 --> 29:26.751
You miss your father's pizza,
don't you?

29:26.753 --> 29:29.087
Get in there. Get in there.
There's my girl!

29:29.089 --> 29:30.658
So... How's it taste?

29:32.827 --> 29:35.193
- Just like home.
- Oh, that's it!

29:35.195 --> 29:37.495
- That's wonderful!
- Oh, come here.

29:37.497 --> 29:39.632
Oh, listen. I made a list
of all the single men

29:39.634 --> 29:42.167
still in the area, okay?
We'll go through it later.

29:42.169 --> 29:44.103
I am so sorry, Mario.

29:44.105 --> 29:45.770
My little girl,
she just came home!

29:45.772 --> 29:47.808
Congratulations, Sal.
Welcome home, Nikki.

29:47.810 --> 29:50.609
- Hi, Mr. Puzzo.
- Hey. Sal, you gotta fix

29:50.611 --> 29:52.111
- the electrical on this place.
- I know.

29:52.113 --> 29:54.282
- Vince told me to tell you.
- Vince?

29:55.317 --> 29:57.651
You spoke
to that gelatinous mass?

29:57.653 --> 29:59.122
Here we go.

30:00.856 --> 30:02.090
Take it.

30:02.558 --> 30:04.761

- Out!

30:14.236 --> 30:15.602
He slept with the enemy.

30:15.604 --> 30:17.338
- Really?
- This is why their side

30:17.340 --> 30:19.342
is always crowded
and ours is empty!

30:23.812 --> 30:27.214
- <i>Che fanno, una festa?</i>

30:27.216 --> 30:30.053
- Really?
- Party indeed.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.658
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

32:09.256 --> 32:10.523
What will your mummy say?

32:10.525 --> 32:13.459
I would insult your mother,

32:13.461 --> 32:16.295
but cows are sacred in India!

32:16.297 --> 32:18.797
Hey, you'll never be the man
that your mother is!

32:18.799 --> 32:21.299
Oh! Thou must go! Bye-bye!

32:21.301 --> 32:23.835
Look, Officer, this is all a
big mistake. This is all just...

32:23.837 --> 32:26.474
Hands against the wall.
Shut up and spread 'em.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.507
I said spread 'em! You need
an invitation to the prom

32:29.509 --> 32:30.843
- to get cozy?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

32:30.845 --> 32:32.478
Hey! Bring those down
to the station.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.879
We're gonna eat them later.

32:33.881 --> 32:36.586
As evidence!
Eyes on the wall, captain.

32:38.287 --> 32:40.319
Oh, my God. That is...

32:40.321 --> 32:41.822
You're carting guns, mister.

32:41.824 --> 32:44.557
You didn't declare
that you had two amazing

32:44.559 --> 32:46.660
man guns.
You hiding anything else?

32:46.662 --> 32:47.893
- Listen...
- Oh, what have you got here?

32:47.895 --> 32:50.297
A six-pack? Oh, no.
I'm sorry, that's eight.

32:50.299 --> 32:52.633
- I'm gonna go south now, okay?
- Hey, now...

32:52.635 --> 32:54.034
- You packing heat here, mister?
- Hands off!

32:54.036 --> 32:55.935
My God. Were you breastfed?

32:55.937 --> 32:57.703
Is there anything
in your pockets

32:57.705 --> 33:00.741
that might be sharp or
hard or pokey in any way?

33:00.743 --> 33:02.644
- What?
- Eyes on the wall!

33:02.646 --> 33:04.979
I'm gonna just check
to see if you...

33:04.981 --> 33:07.315
Oh, my God... if you smell
like pot or anything.

33:07.317 --> 33:10.684
Hey, all right, listen. You're
clean, buddy. You're clean.

33:10.686 --> 33:12.654
Or are you dirty? I don't know.

33:12.656 --> 33:13.654
I don't know.

33:13.656 --> 33:15.792
But I've got my eyes on you.

33:18.427 --> 33:19.827
Let's go!

33:19.829 --> 33:24.465
Whoa! The issue of your loins
did this!

33:29.572 --> 33:31.339
That's right, you heard her!

33:31.341 --> 33:33.945
- Ma!
- Welcome home, Nikki.

33:35.079 --> 33:37.581
He deserved everything he got!
Again with hitting!

33:38.749 --> 33:41.083
Don't look at him, Nikki.
Okay, folks.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.720
Who's got the munchies?
Right this way, please.

33:44.722 --> 33:47.424
All right, folks.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.427
The show's over, okay?

34:15.420 --> 34:17.855
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned

34:17.857 --> 34:20.393
in thought, in word and in deed.

34:21.426 --> 34:22.893
A triple threat.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.563
You tell me your sins,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.833
- and I'll tell you mine.
- Our sins!

34:28.835 --> 34:31.371
We'll go to hell
for meeting like this.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.871
Our sons, I think
they're onto us!

34:33.873 --> 34:35.976
I love you
when you get so passionate.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.811
You watch it!
The church has eyes.

34:39.813 --> 34:41.911
- But not as beautiful as yours!
- No!

34:41.914 --> 34:44.951
Now, give me a taste
of that special sauce.

34:45.952 --> 34:48.422
- Jesus!
- No! Father Toscani.

34:49.722 --> 34:50.821
Franca?

34:50.822 --> 34:52.822
<i>Oh, Gesu! Perdonami!</i>

34:52.824 --> 34:53.960
<i>Perdonami!</i>

34:55.628 --> 34:57.396
Forgive me, Father!

34:57.398 --> 34:59.000
Oh, we're so busted!

35:04.406 --> 35:05.774
Thank you.

35:22.724 --> 35:23.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:27.463 --> 35:28.965
- Nice bag.
- Hmm.

35:29.697 --> 35:30.833
Nice...

35:32.001 --> 35:32.932
ball.

35:32.934 --> 35:34.536
Oh.

35:38.441 --> 35:39.776
Ahem.

35:42.811 --> 35:44.610
Hey, Lisa.

35:44.612 --> 35:46.181
Hey, baby.

35:46.183 --> 35:48.252
Oh, Nikki.

35:52.522 --> 35:53.958
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to your little friend here?

35:55.158 --> 35:56.861
Yeah, of course.

35:57.828 --> 35:58.963
Lisa, meet Nikki,

35:59.895 --> 36:01.728
my... My best friend

36:01.730 --> 36:03.500
since, you know, we were like...

36:04.633 --> 36:05.836
Well, forever.

36:09.806 --> 36:11.840
Well, that's about
as much chitchat

36:11.842 --> 36:13.844
as I can handle for today.
I need a drink.

36:15.612 --> 36:17.715
Don't keep me waiting.

36:18.148 --> 36:21.583
Bad timing? I just...
I just came by to say sorry...

36:21.585 --> 36:23.117
- No, no.
- ...about my dad and the whole arrest thing.

36:23.119 --> 36:25.690
Come on. A misdemeanor
for pot possession?

36:25.922 --> 36:29.224
Please. My dad had your dad
investigated for tax evasion.

36:29.226 --> 36:30.693
And the year before that,

36:30.695 --> 36:32.864
your dad tried
to have Jogi deported, so...

36:34.499 --> 36:37.169
When did all of this go from
crazy to bat-shit insane?

36:38.069 --> 36:39.136
You know what?

36:39.138 --> 36:42.571
We've never apologized for
their stupidity before, so

36:42.573 --> 36:43.909
let's not start now, okay?

36:44.910 --> 36:47.814
- You're right. Thanks.
- Hey, Leo...

36:48.680 --> 36:49.649
Uh...

36:50.214 --> 36:52.515
you know, I'd love to, uh,

36:52.517 --> 36:54.920
finish what we started
the other night, but...

36:55.120 --> 36:57.755
Yeah, no, it's fine. I... I'm...

36:57.757 --> 36:59.690
I'm around. You know,

36:59.692 --> 37:01.893
plenty of time to fool around.
I mean, you know what I mean,

37:01.895 --> 37:03.628
just hang out or something.

37:03.630 --> 37:06.597
- Yeah, right. Okay. Well...
- <i>Hello?</i>

37:06.599 --> 37:09.770
- Final boarding call?
- It's not what you...

37:10.837 --> 37:11.902
Hey, wait! Listen.

37:11.904 --> 37:12.839
Ahem.

37:14.907 --> 37:16.610
You wanna have dinner
tomorrow night?

37:16.976 --> 37:18.645
You wanna come here,
like around 8:00?

37:19.545 --> 37:20.710
I'll cook.

37:20.712 --> 37:22.948
Really? I mean yeah, sure.

37:22.950 --> 37:24.752
Best friend's gotta eat, right?

37:25.553 --> 37:26.221
Cool.

37:27.220 --> 37:28.720
Oh.

37:28.722 --> 37:30.622
- Okay.
- Oh. Sorry. Ahem.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.896
- Bye!
- I'll see you!

All right! <i>Andiamo!</i> Okay.

Remember, the first one

37:54.148 --> 37:55.949

He's an a-hole! Who's in?

37:58.118 --> 38:00.886
Hey, I'll take that bet!

38:03.290 --> 38:05.857
- Okay, they're coming!
- Everyone step back. Step back.

38:05.859 --> 38:06.794

<i>...but this does not bode well

Ah...

38:15.771 --> 38:17.807
These are dark days.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.608
Drugs, arrests.

38:20.610 --> 38:22.175
It's an <i>infamia!</i>

38:22.177 --> 38:24.945
You know, this used to be
a nice place to live.

38:24.947 --> 38:27.780
Now... the riffraff is here.

38:27.782 --> 38:29.316
No good.

38:29.318 --> 38:31.919
- How you doin' tonight, Vince?
- Not bad.

38:31.921 --> 38:35.656
Some <i>imbecille</i> tried to smoke
me out of business yesterday.

38:35.658 --> 38:37.058
You get charged for that?

38:37.060 --> 38:39.293
A night in jail.
Frankly, I took a rest,

38:39.295 --> 38:41.763
because even with a $1,000 fine,

38:41.765 --> 38:43.199
record sales.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.368
That's big talk for a jailbird.

38:46.370 --> 38:48.069
Must've got lucky in the shower.

38:49.373 --> 38:51.172
Come on, Vince!
You gonna take that?

38:51.174 --> 38:52.873
Sal...

38:52.875 --> 38:54.775
what's it like
having Nikki home, huh?

38:54.777 --> 38:56.745
It's the best.

38:56.747 --> 38:58.747
My <i>gioia mia</i> is home! <i>Salut!</i>

38:58.749 --> 39:00.282
<i>Salut.</i>

39:00.284 --> 39:03.084
Luigi, isn't that true
that usually the daughter

39:03.086 --> 39:05.121
takes after the mother?
Thank God.

39:05.123 --> 39:07.256
And the son
takes after the father.

39:07.258 --> 39:10.026
So soon, Leo will not be able
to see his feet.

39:13.363 --> 39:16.164
My Nikki is the complete package.
She's beautiful,

39:16.166 --> 39:18.300
she cooks, and smart.

39:18.302 --> 39:20.936
She's got it up here
and knows how to use it.

39:20.938 --> 39:23.239
Unlike some children
that only know how to use

39:23.241 --> 39:25.408
what's down there.

39:25.410 --> 39:27.743
The small man wishes
he had half the action

39:27.745 --> 39:29.679
- that my Leo does.
- All right, Pa.

39:29.681 --> 39:30.946
Leave me out of this, would you?

39:30.948 --> 39:33.417
Viagra wanted to take
a sample of his blood!

39:34.886 --> 39:37.219
Luigi, does his asshole

39:37.221 --> 39:39.221
get jealous of the shit
coming out of his mouth?

39:39.223 --> 39:42.426
How is it possible

39:42.428 --> 39:45.127
that a mere beast
with no brains and no looks

39:45.129 --> 39:47.965
could actually
be the genetic father

39:47.967 --> 39:49.833
- of a complete package?
- Luigi...

39:49.835 --> 39:52.235
is this bewildered sloth

39:52.237 --> 39:53.970
questioning my fatherhood?

39:53.972 --> 39:56.941
Luigi, it's not his fatherhood
in question, but his manhood.

39:56.943 --> 39:58.809

40:26.107 --> 40:30.942

Father Toscani is onto us,

40:30.944 --> 40:33.080
the church is out.

40:33.815 --> 40:34.849
I feel terrible.

41:09.852 --> 41:12.153

Good point.

You know Joe's a plumber now?
Fully certified.

It's Joe's Plumbing.

- Honey, I almost forgot

42:13.551 --> 42:15.886
- the nice cannolis.
- Ooh. Thank you, baby.

42:15.888 --> 42:18.322
- Mm-hmm.
- Oof. Here, take the gum.

42:18.324 --> 42:19.793
Leave the cannolis.

42:20.592 --> 42:22.261
Hi, Joey Junior!

42:23.362 --> 42:25.899
I can't believe you've had two
kids in the time I've been gone.

42:26.098 --> 42:28.101
Ugh, I know. It's like
my uterus threw a party.

42:30.002 --> 42:32.071
So... the stewardess.

42:33.172 --> 42:34.439
She looked like
she got off shift

- at the perfume counter.
- <i>Puttana.</i>

42:36.508 --> 42:38.813

it was totally fake.

42:39.412 --> 42:41.882
But, uh... you're still
gonna go for dinner?

42:42.449 --> 42:43.550
He wants to cook.

42:45.052 --> 42:48.586
Besides, if I don't go, he's gonna think
he's had some sort of effect on me.

42:48.588 --> 42:50.120
And he hasn't.

42:50.122 --> 42:52.423
So I should go... to prove it.

I am going back to London

43:04.171 --> 43:05.971
and when I am
the <i>chef de cuisine</i>

43:05.973 --> 43:08.339
at Mayfair's newest
and trendiest restaurant,

43:08.341 --> 43:10.211
Leo is not even gonna
be an afterthought.

43:12.145 --> 43:13.314
Wow.

43:13.948 --> 43:15.482
You're still in love with him.

43:16.484 --> 43:20.018
All those years of pent-up
sexual frustration.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.588
No wonder you're so skinny.

43:21.590 --> 43:23.222
- You must diddle yourself like a fiend.
- Would you stop?

43:23.224 --> 43:26.194
Oh! Look who's here!

43:27.295 --> 43:29.262
Look, it's Anthony Bottiluco!

43:29.264 --> 43:31.130
You remember Anthony, right?
Look at him.

43:31.132 --> 43:32.564
Look at him, all grown up! Hi!

43:32.566 --> 43:34.133
Hi.

43:34.135 --> 43:36.135
Nikki. Long time.

43:36.137 --> 43:37.570
You look, uh, you look good.

43:37.572 --> 43:40.507
Oh, you're lookin'...
you know, the same.

43:40.509 --> 43:42.441
- Thanks.
- Are you still at the, uh...

43:42.443 --> 43:45.144
Oh, at the parlor? Yeah.
Yeah, Pops retired,

43:45.146 --> 43:48.151
so hey, I'm your guy if you need
any funeral arrangements.

43:48.685 --> 43:51.654
- Good to know.
- Hey, speaking of which, how's your Nonna doing?

43:53.522 --> 43:55.555
- Mom, where is Nonna?
- Oh, she's at church.

43:55.557 --> 43:57.658
That lady prays
more than the pope.

43:57.660 --> 44:00.060
- Here you go.
- Oh. Ah.

44:00.062 --> 44:01.995
Give me a minute
before he starts crying again.

44:01.997 --> 44:03.297
- Oh. Hey, Gina.
- Yeah, I'm gonna let you two

44:03.299 --> 44:05.265
- catch up.
- No. Oh, no. That's okay.

44:05.267 --> 44:07.368
Little Nikki, all grown up. Hey.

44:07.370 --> 44:10.208
- Hi.
- Took the shoes off, huh?

44:10.574 --> 44:12.309
Lettin' the toes breathe.

44:14.011 --> 44:16.648
Look at that big toe. Very nice.

44:20.150 --> 44:21.119
I have to pee.

44:21.617 --> 44:22.320
Ah. Okay.

44:25.154 --> 44:27.557
- Maybe he's changed a lot. No!
- Oh, yeah.

44:30.326 --> 44:31.994
Oh, that's good.

44:34.131 --> 44:36.935
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

44:38.102 --> 44:40.102
- <i>♪ Come on ♪</i>
- This is really good.

44:40.104 --> 44:42.206
Those are just the appetizers.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.707
Tonight's main course

44:44.709 --> 44:47.479
features my signature
ultra-thin crust pizza

44:48.345 --> 44:50.278
with mesquite mushrooms,

44:50.280 --> 44:52.214
smoked gouda,
a little prosciutto,

44:52.216 --> 44:54.686
and then we top it off with
radicchio and fresh arugula.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.120
So good.

44:59.257 --> 45:00.960
Have you considered...

45:01.594 --> 45:03.063
Figs?

45:04.362 --> 45:05.264
May I?

45:06.297 --> 45:07.232
Have at it.

45:08.634 --> 45:11.103
To cut through the gouda
and balance the flavors.

45:14.540 --> 45:16.275
You got some
serious knife skills.

45:17.375 --> 45:19.509
<i>♪ Summer days fall ♪</i>

45:19.511 --> 45:22.549
My father would consider this
the highest form of treason.

45:23.282 --> 45:24.551
What's that, the pizza?

45:25.385 --> 45:26.520
Or us being together?

45:27.720 --> 45:28.588
Both.

45:31.258 --> 45:31.725
It's pretty good.

45:33.292 --> 45:34.595
- Hot.
- Very.

45:35.796 --> 45:37.562
700 degrees. It should
only take about...

45:37.564 --> 45:39.133
About 90 seconds.

45:39.698 --> 45:40.401
Exactly.

45:42.602 --> 45:44.736
Why don't you do something
like this down at your pizzeria?

45:44.738 --> 45:46.641
I mean, you'd have
lines down the block.

45:47.408 --> 45:49.310
Uh, my father, he, you know...

45:50.143 --> 45:52.244
He believes that pizza
should be round

45:52.246 --> 45:53.415
with sauce and mozzarella.

45:55.850 --> 45:58.185
And, you know, I cook
what makes him happy.

46:02.190 --> 46:04.760
And what about you, Leo?
What makes you happy?

46:06.226 --> 46:08.196

46:08.830 --> 46:09.532

46:27.381 --> 46:30.450
I don't need your help.
Okay? Patience.

46:30.452 --> 46:32.519
No. I'm telling you, it's done.

46:32.521 --> 46:34.324
Just give it another moment,

Come on. Please.

46:57.181 --> 46:58.249
My fresh arugula.

46:59.883 --> 47:01.349
Listen to this.

47:03.220 --> 47:04.222
The sound of perfection.

47:04.554 --> 47:06.822
You better believe it.

47:06.824 --> 47:07.722
For you.

47:07.724 --> 47:08.860
Thank you.

47:14.565 --> 47:17.702
- Mm! It's delicious.
- The figs, they just...

47:18.769 --> 47:20.434
They give it the perfect amount
of sweetness, you know?

47:20.436 --> 47:21.506
For the smoky, spicy side.

47:22.439 --> 47:23.441
Mm-hmm.

47:25.877 --> 47:27.113
I love your pizza.

47:28.446 --> 47:29.547
Our pizza.

47:44.428 --> 47:46.429
Oh, <i>dio!</i>

47:46.431 --> 47:48.565
You scared me to death!

47:48.567 --> 47:51.203
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

47:52.271 --> 47:53.836
Not in front of the Madonna!

47:53.838 --> 47:56.240
- It's a bad omen!
- No. It's bad luck

47:56.242 --> 47:57.544
to be superstitious.

47:59.445 --> 48:01.347
Franca.

48:05.418 --> 48:07.585
With the Virgin Mary
as my witness,

48:07.587 --> 48:09.290
will you marry me?

48:32.613 --> 48:33.648
Women.

48:35.449 --> 48:37.016
Not you, of course, Maria.

48:45.393 --> 48:48.460
Leo, this is amazing!

48:48.462 --> 48:50.765
I grow all my fresh
ingredients up here.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.967
Basil, oregano,

48:54.969 --> 48:58.274
some fennel. You name it.
And it's all organic.

48:59.274 --> 49:01.376
Now, you're speaking
my language.

49:01.609 --> 49:03.410
You know, one day,
I hope something like this

49:03.412 --> 49:04.314
could be my legacy.

49:05.513 --> 49:07.848
Like a pizza shop on the bottom,

49:07.850 --> 49:09.482
organic garden on top.

49:09.484 --> 49:11.387
I'll call it Pizza Organica.

49:12.655 --> 49:15.022
I love it.
Have you leased a space?

49:15.024 --> 49:17.457
No, but I got my eye on a spot.

49:17.459 --> 49:18.661
Still saving up, though.

49:20.361 --> 49:22.429
Maybe when my dad
retires, right?

49:22.431 --> 49:24.901
Leo, why would you wait?
That could be in 20 years!

49:26.435 --> 49:27.735
What do you want me to do?

49:27.737 --> 49:28.672
Compete with him?

49:32.007 --> 49:33.708
Mm.

49:33.710 --> 49:35.576
How is it that I'm the one
in culinary school, and yet

49:35.578 --> 49:37.344
you're the one coming up
with the dishes?

49:40.516 --> 49:42.986
I love this festival.
Didn't you miss it?

49:43.853 --> 49:45.890
Our parents' hate-iversary.

49:46.823 --> 49:48.990
I don't understand
how you start a fight

49:48.992 --> 49:51.426
after winning
a contest together.

49:51.428 --> 49:53.264
I mean, for making something
that you love.

49:54.365 --> 49:56.365
I don't think they even
remember what it was about.

49:59.970 --> 50:00.639
Listen.

50:02.972 --> 50:04.840
- Come on.
- Why?

50:04.842 --> 50:07.778
Come here. You remember?

50:08.378 --> 50:11.580
- Remember what?
- The tarantella, <i>stupida.</i>

50:11.582 --> 50:13.616
Settle down, <i>stupido.</i>

50:13.618 --> 50:16.054
I got it all locked in here.

50:29.100 --> 50:31.836
You know, the last time
we danced together was...

50:32.136 --> 50:32.972
at Gina's wedding.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.041
- You kissed me.
- You kissed me!

50:37.043 --> 50:38.478
I don't know.
No, I think you started it.

50:40.380 --> 50:42.713
I'm pretty sure I was drunk.
That's what I remember.

50:42.715 --> 50:43.784
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

50:45.152 --> 50:47.586
That was the last time I saw you
before you took off for London.

50:49.088 --> 50:51.021
I couldn't believe
that you'd just

50:51.023 --> 50:52.492
left without saying bye.

50:54.126 --> 50:55.594
Have you been lonely?

50:58.064 --> 51:00.033
Okay, fine. Who's...

51:01.567 --> 51:03.100
the investment banker?

51:03.102 --> 51:04.770
You've been keeping tabs on me?

51:04.772 --> 51:06.605
Maybe a little bit.

51:06.607 --> 51:09.076
I might have checked out your
Facebook page a few times.

51:10.544 --> 51:12.613
You look ridiculous in
that chef's hat, by the way.

51:13.113 --> 51:15.450
You look ridiculous
in your hair net.

51:16.149 --> 51:17.951
- I don't wear one.
- Well, you're supposed to.

51:18.451 --> 51:19.687
Is that so?

51:32.467 --> 51:34.670
I should go.

51:35.836 --> 51:36.637
Why?

51:39.541 --> 51:40.809
So I don't stay.

52:02.131 --> 52:04.198
I'll take that.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.665
Thanks, Jessie.

52:08.470 --> 52:11.072
"You squeeze
the love out of every tomato

52:11.074 --> 52:12.610

52:14.210 --> 52:15.445
Nonna, what's wrong?

52:17.079 --> 52:18.681
I've been thinking
about your <i>nonno.</i>

52:19.648 --> 52:20.717
Missing him?

52:21.985 --> 52:23.454
What was he like?

52:25.054 --> 52:27.889
The biggest ladies' man
in all of Napoli.

52:27.891 --> 52:31.025
The charm of ten Italian men.

52:31.027 --> 52:32.195
What made him settle down?

52:34.064 --> 52:36.700
I hit him over the head
with a piece of prosciutto.

52:36.934 --> 52:38.537
Out of love, of course.

52:40.771 --> 52:41.705
Have you ever been in love?

52:43.673 --> 52:44.775
Maybe.

52:48.613 --> 52:50.582
You take over, <i>bella.</i>

52:51.015 --> 52:53.585
- Okay.
- You tell your papa that...

52:55.753 --> 52:56.855
I went out.

52:57.989 --> 52:58.857
Okay.

53:10.701 --> 53:12.569
Figs?

53:12.571 --> 53:14.570
Your father sees this,

53:14.572 --> 53:16.842
he's gonna blow a gasket.

53:20.311 --> 53:21.648
How was your date last night?

53:25.684 --> 53:26.887
How'd you know that I, uh...

53:27.921 --> 53:30.957
Little Italy. It's little.

53:31.256 --> 53:32.659
Look, it wasn't a date, but...

53:33.892 --> 53:34.894
it was nice.

53:35.294 --> 53:36.697
Meaning?

53:38.097 --> 53:40.133
Nice, you know.
It was... it was...

53:42.235 --> 53:43.903
It was very nice.

53:44.637 --> 53:47.609
But I don't know, Nonno.
It's complicated with Nikki.

53:48.908 --> 53:52.913
Leo, here's what I learned
about love,

53:53.813 --> 53:55.683
life and cooking.

53:56.817 --> 53:58.152
Learn from your mistakes.

53:59.085 --> 54:00.587
Be fearless.

54:01.355 --> 54:03.257
But above all,

54:04.625 --> 54:05.827
have fun.

54:11.833 --> 54:14.802
I don't know. I think maybe
she's outgrown this place.

54:15.804 --> 54:18.037
Leo, you can take

54:18.039 --> 54:20.006
the girl out of Little Italy,

54:20.008 --> 54:22.745
but you can't take Little Italy
out of the girl.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.746
Show her what she's missing.

54:27.115 --> 54:28.584
Thanks, Nonno.

54:28.849 --> 54:30.749
I'm getting a cup of coffee.

54:30.751 --> 54:32.020
What the hell is this?

54:33.756 --> 54:34.591
What is that?

54:34.890 --> 54:36.926
Delicious, is what it is.

54:37.759 --> 54:40.227
Give it a try, Pa. All right?
I'm gonna get out of here.

54:40.229 --> 54:42.996
- Oh, my <i>buono!</i> Oh, my God!
- Sweet and smoky

54:42.998 --> 54:46.136
- at the same time! Mm!
- Delicious! This is fantastic!

54:46.801 --> 54:49.136
- Figs on a pizza! Who knew?
- Mm! Mm!

54:49.138 --> 54:51.304
- Oh, so good!
- Oh!

55:02.753 --> 55:04.686
Another caramel latte
for Madonna.

55:04.688 --> 55:06.854
- Keep them coming.
- You got it, "Material Girl."

55:06.856 --> 55:09.159
- Hey, hey! That's enough!
- Hey, hey! Why did you do that?

55:10.126 --> 55:11.728
Come here. Give me that face.

55:11.994 --> 55:13.330
For your own good.

55:14.164 --> 55:16.167
What do you want from me, Carlo?

55:17.333 --> 55:19.099
Well, the other day, you said

55:19.101 --> 55:20.606
if I wanted it,
I had to put a ring on it.

55:20.872 --> 55:22.040
And I did,

55:22.774 --> 55:25.377
in front of the Virgin Mary,
no less, and you...

55:25.877 --> 55:26.912
You fled.

55:27.678 --> 55:29.213
What is it, my love?

55:30.048 --> 55:31.283
It's too hard, Carlo.

55:32.749 --> 55:34.285
After Alvaro died...

55:35.687 --> 55:38.656
I swore I would never
mourn another man in my life.

55:39.022 --> 55:40.890
Well, we could have, uh,

55:40.892 --> 55:43.058
what do they say, uh...

55:43.060 --> 55:44.095
friendly benefits?

55:46.998 --> 55:50.733
You almost sent
my dentures flying across the room!

55:50.735 --> 55:52.004
I am a lady.

55:53.371 --> 55:55.806
Yes, and...

55:55.808 --> 55:57.376
I want you to be my lady.

55:58.342 --> 56:01.146
You don't think that Alvaro
wants you to be happy?

56:01.813 --> 56:03.413
The only regrets we'll ever have

56:03.415 --> 56:06.083
are the chances we didn't take,

56:06.085 --> 56:08.756
and the love we didn't make.

56:10.390 --> 56:12.189
I don't wanna hide no more,

56:12.191 --> 56:14.725
and go back
to my stupid son's house

56:14.727 --> 56:17.194
alone at night.

56:17.196 --> 56:21.466
I want us to have
a home together.

56:21.468 --> 56:24.102
A place to cuddle

56:24.104 --> 56:28.108
and watch <i>The Bachelor</i> in bed.

56:30.876 --> 56:32.780
I love you, Franca.

56:38.052 --> 56:40.689
I never thought
I'd hear that again.

56:44.090 --> 56:46.161
I love you, too, Carlo.

56:47.293 --> 56:48.163
Franca...

56:49.195 --> 56:50.230
with God...

56:52.199 --> 56:55.036
and this beardo-weirdo
as my witness,

56:55.469 --> 56:58.340
I promise I will love you

56:58.774 --> 57:00.810

57:02.943 --> 57:05.180

57:05.814 --> 57:06.982

57:09.785 --> 57:10.853
Yes.

57:12.921 --> 57:14.086

- Say it!

01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:49.171
Never.

01:03:19.302 --> 01:03:22.207
Already in my purse with
the shower caps and the Q-tips.

01:03:24.207 --> 01:03:26.343
And, uh...

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.279

Good. Now, here.

Look. Our new endeavor.

01:04:53.967 --> 01:04:55.869

01:04:57.305 --> 01:04:59.441
- It's stunning.
- <i>Of course it is!</i>

01:04:59.874 --> 01:05:01.707
<i>It's only missing
one little detail,</i>

01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:03.408
<i>a stunning menu.</i>

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:05.378
<i>Gareth has sent me his.
When do I get yours?</i>

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.782
I'm close, Chef. I can feel it.

<i>Your hair looks like
you've been shagging.</i>

01:05:11.452 --> 01:05:14.287
<i>Is there a penis
more pressing than my menu?</i>

01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:16.588
No! No, no, no. No. I'm on it!

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.356
I mean, not on that,

01:05:18.358 --> 01:05:20.960
but I'm on it. I'm...
You know what I mean.

01:05:20.962 --> 01:05:22.696
Well, there's only one way
to the top, Nicole,

01:05:22.698 --> 01:05:23.665
<i>and it's a solo trip.</i>

01:05:24.866 --> 01:05:26.799
<i>Now, listen.
You have until Sunday.</i>

01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:29.536
<i>Otherwise, you can be the first
to congratulate Gareth.</i>

01:05:29.538 --> 01:05:31.641
- Oh, sorry! Sorry!
- Watch out, you wanker!

01:05:31.839 --> 01:05:33.440
<i>Do you not see
I'm standing here?</i>

01:05:42.685 --> 01:05:44.352
If that's not
the hottest advertisement

01:05:44.354 --> 01:05:46.690
in all of Little Italy,
I don't know what is.

01:05:48.525 --> 01:05:49.927
How you doin'?

01:05:50.726 --> 01:05:51.728
Thank you.

01:05:53.563 --> 01:05:54.597
For what?

01:05:55.699 --> 01:05:56.867
Making me feel at home again.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.702
Making it all so special.

01:06:00.704 --> 01:06:02.606
Everything's more special
now that you're back.

01:06:03.606 --> 01:06:05.409
I mean that.

01:06:09.647 --> 01:06:12.984
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- What's the matter?

01:06:13.484 --> 01:06:15.819
I... What are we doing?

01:06:16.986 --> 01:06:18.986
I'm not... I'm not a kid anymore

01:06:18.988 --> 01:06:20.824
and I know who I am to you.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.958
Okay? I mean, I was the girl
that beat you at soccer,

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.728
and then I was the girl
who had the silly crush on you,

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:28.029
- and now...
- Nikki.

01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:30.098
...I'm a girl
who's been in your bed.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.568
- Oh, no. No, no, no...
- I've worked too hard

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.472
to come back to this,
I mean, to slaving away

01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:36.972
in a pizza joint
for the rest of my life,

01:06:36.974 --> 01:06:39.742
and watching
our families fighting,

01:06:39.744 --> 01:06:41.746
and watching you
grow old with somebody else.

01:06:43.114 --> 01:06:44.049
With who?

01:06:44.983 --> 01:06:47.083
I don't know. Pick a number.

01:06:47.085 --> 01:06:49.588
I'm sure one will come knocking on
the door the second that I leave.

01:06:55.059 --> 01:06:57.530
Look, I've...
I've really enjoyed our

01:06:58.464 --> 01:06:59.599
tryst, I just...

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:04.471
"Tryst"? Really?

01:07:06.171 --> 01:07:07.773
I have to go.

01:07:20.487 --> 01:07:21.689
How does it look?

01:07:22.922 --> 01:07:25.157
The only thing we've saved
for a rainy day is an umbrella.

01:07:25.159 --> 01:07:26.925
And it's broken.

01:07:26.927 --> 01:07:29.161
We can't lose this place,
Mali. It's the only thing

01:07:29.163 --> 01:07:31.128
- we got to leave to our kid.
- Well then maybe you should

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.697
believe in Leo, huh?

01:07:32.699 --> 01:07:35.065
I mean, let him try it his way!

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:37.101
Little Italy is changing, Vinny,

01:07:37.103 --> 01:07:38.872
but that doesn't have to be bad.

01:07:39.706 --> 01:07:42.173
Hey, guys, I'm gonna go
for a walk. Okay? I'll be back.

01:07:42.175 --> 01:07:44.479
I'm closing
a little early tonight, Leo.

01:07:44.845 --> 01:07:46.111
- What?
- Why?

01:07:46.113 --> 01:07:47.916
Because I'm taking
the family to dinner!

01:07:48.149 --> 01:07:49.714
- What?
- Why?

01:07:49.716 --> 01:07:52.720
Do I have to give a reason?
Who raised you people?

01:07:53.488 --> 01:07:55.591
Dress nice. Be ready by 7:00.

01:07:55.823 --> 01:07:57.024
You too, kid.

01:07:58.193 --> 01:08:00.026
Okay!

01:08:00.028 --> 01:08:02.497
- I hope he's paying.
- Oh, he's paying.

01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:08.071
Mm.

01:08:11.674 --> 01:08:13.710
Baby.

01:08:14.176 --> 01:08:16.143
You know, I have trained
with the world's finest,

01:08:16.145 --> 01:08:18.712
but nothing comes close
to Nonna's sauce.

01:08:18.714 --> 01:08:20.714
It's like I can taste
what's in it, but I just can't

01:08:20.716 --> 01:08:23.549
- put my finger on it.
- Yeah, well, good luck with that.

01:08:23.551 --> 01:08:24.720
She hasn't even
told your father.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.590
We are so proud of you, Nikki.

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:30.993
And so very happy
that you are home.

01:08:31.725 --> 01:08:33.193
Have you ever thought about...

01:08:33.194 --> 01:08:34.198
leaving here, Ma?

01:08:36.032 --> 01:08:37.599
Leaving? No.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.836
No, it never occurred to me.

01:08:39.903 --> 01:08:41.037
It's a big world out there.

01:08:41.604 --> 01:08:43.705
I know. I've been
to Niagara Falls,

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:45.540
thank you very much.

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:47.645
Come on. I mean, how do you

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:51.045
stay so happy?
You guys are going broke here,

01:08:51.046 --> 01:08:53.881
you and dad are fighting
all the time, and yet,

01:08:53.883 --> 01:08:55.951
you just seem
as in love as ever.

01:08:55.953 --> 01:08:57.755
- Dora!
- You are killin' me!

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:03.594
Okay. You really wanna know?

01:09:04.294 --> 01:09:05.796
Not if it's about sex.

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:07.997
Well, I mean,

01:09:07.999 --> 01:09:11.036
good sex is
a key ingredient, but

01:09:11.734 --> 01:09:13.836
a good man

01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:16.640
is the meal you wanna
eat every night.

01:09:17.941 --> 01:09:20.109
Still sounded sexual.

01:09:20.111 --> 01:09:21.711
- Didn't it? I'm sorry.
- It's a little bit...

01:09:21.712 --> 01:09:22.611
Yeah, a little bit.

01:09:22.613 --> 01:09:23.915
- Ah!
- Ah!

01:09:27.018 --> 01:09:27.886
Wha...

01:09:29.587 --> 01:09:30.319
I love you.

01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:31.723
I love you.

01:09:34.058 --> 01:09:35.658
Sal, what?

01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:37.761
You messing with my sauce?

01:09:37.763 --> 01:09:38.798
You don't mess with perfection.

01:09:40.933 --> 01:09:44.203
- Anybody looking?
- No. What?

01:09:45.071 --> 01:09:47.069
My <i>nonna</i>

01:09:47.072 --> 01:09:49.038
would stir in two anchovies

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:51.544
just for long enough
to salt the sauce.

01:09:53.813 --> 01:09:55.549
Don't tell nobody.

01:09:57.282 --> 01:09:59.083
- Dance with me! Dance with me!
- All right. Everybody!

01:09:59.085 --> 01:10:02.555
Everybody! Family dinner
tonight. My treat.

01:10:02.854 --> 01:10:04.621
- Why?
- What's the occasion?

01:10:04.623 --> 01:10:07.124
I need a reason to make dinner
with my family?

01:10:07.126 --> 01:10:09.861
I'm gonna die soon
and I like food. That's it.

01:10:09.863 --> 01:10:10.999
Dinner at 7:00. You, too. Come.

01:10:19.974 --> 01:10:22.340
Welcome to Korma Sutra.

01:10:22.342 --> 01:10:25.712
- Ugh. I'm gonna get gas.
- The Lustful Lotus.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.879
Try it on the menu...

01:10:27.881 --> 01:10:29.717
- and at home.
- Mm!

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.951
Ma...

01:10:31.953 --> 01:10:33.853
This is the restaurant
you pick for a family dinner?

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:36.121
- Yeah.
- It's an interesting choice, Nonna.

01:10:36.123 --> 01:10:39.358
- How'd you find it?
- I did the Yelp.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.294
And besides,

01:10:41.296 --> 01:10:43.295
if your father make a scene...

01:10:43.297 --> 01:10:45.130
no one we know will see.

01:10:45.132 --> 01:10:47.735
Ma, why would I make...
What the hell?

01:10:48.302 --> 01:10:49.868
What the hell?

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:51.574
Hey, welcome!
Welcome, everybody!

01:10:51.806 --> 01:10:53.973
- That's it. I'm leaving.
- You sit!

01:10:53.975 --> 01:10:55.209
I'd rather sit in hell!

01:11:02.684 --> 01:11:03.883
Now, Franca and I

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.089
have something
to tell all of you.

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:09.256
While our families

01:11:09.258 --> 01:11:11.792
have been at war,
two people here

01:11:11.794 --> 01:11:13.096
have fallen in love.

01:11:14.096 --> 01:11:16.195
I swear to God, Vince,
if your slimy son

01:11:16.197 --> 01:11:18.231
- has touched my daughter...
- The only thing slimy is you!

01:11:18.233 --> 01:11:19.804
Shut up, both of you!

01:11:22.773 --> 01:11:24.008
Carlo and I...

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:28.646
We've been seeing each other.

01:11:29.312 --> 01:11:30.648
- Huh?
- What?

01:11:31.113 --> 01:11:33.183
What do you mean
"seeing each other"?

01:11:34.183 --> 01:11:35.919
We've been
having a relationship.

01:11:37.187 --> 01:11:38.787
What do you mean

01:11:38.789 --> 01:11:40.254
"having a relationship"?

01:11:40.256 --> 01:11:42.156
Forgive me, Salvatore.

01:11:42.158 --> 01:11:43.692
We've been lovers.

01:11:46.264 --> 01:11:49.368
- Oh. Okay.
- I don't understand.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.933
Do you want me
to draw you a picture?

01:11:51.935 --> 01:11:54.837
Or you can pick
one of those from the menu.

01:11:54.839 --> 01:11:57.005
Oh, stop. Put that down.

01:11:57.007 --> 01:12:00.276
Oh. Oh. Just gonna
need this knife, Ma.

01:12:00.278 --> 01:12:02.745
- I'm gonna open a vein.
- I can't feel my legs.

01:12:02.747 --> 01:12:05.815
- I think it's wonderful!
- Oh!

01:12:05.817 --> 01:12:07.850
Now, if you two could just
start acting like grown-ups...

01:12:07.852 --> 01:12:10.386
Yeah, then maybe we can
put an end to this whole

01:12:10.388 --> 01:12:13.223
- stupid family war.
- This is your fault.

01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:15.258
Your fault!
You and your horny, old man!

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.393
Hey! You don't even know where
your own mother is at night!

01:12:17.395 --> 01:12:19.362
- Watch your mouth!
- That's it. You know what?

01:12:19.364 --> 01:12:21.298
Little Italy is not big enough
for me and you.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.332
You're right.
So, when are you leaving?

01:12:23.334 --> 01:12:25.935
We're not leaving! The Angioli
pizza has always been superior,

01:12:25.937 --> 01:12:27.903
so do the community a favor.

01:12:27.905 --> 01:12:29.206
Pack up your <i>fugazi</i> pizza
and get the hell out of town!

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:31.441
- Here we go.
- Again.

01:12:31.443 --> 01:12:32.879
You wouldn't know
good pizza if it bit you!

01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:39.382
Let's let Little Italy decide
who stays and who goes.

01:12:39.384 --> 01:12:40.987
What are you two idiots
talking about?

01:12:41.987 --> 01:12:43.222
The Little Italy pizza contest.

01:12:43.522 --> 01:12:45.156
Yeah.

01:12:45.158 --> 01:12:47.492
- And whoever loses goes.
- Vince!

01:12:47.494 --> 01:12:50.193
- They won't let you enter.
- Yeah. You're banned.

01:12:50.195 --> 01:12:52.363
Yeah, we're banned,
but these two aren't.

01:12:52.365 --> 01:12:55.704
- Hmm?
- We can't compete, but Leo and Nikki can.

01:12:57.537 --> 01:13:01.038
- What?
- No, no, no, no, no. No way. All right?

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.342
- We're not competing.
- I'm a chef. I don't do pizza.

01:13:04.344 --> 01:13:06.310
- Ow.
- Oh.

01:13:06.312 --> 01:13:09.047
- You did pizza the other night.
- Leo!

01:13:09.049 --> 01:13:11.249
- What night?
- There was some kind of night?

01:13:11.251 --> 01:13:13.418
- What do you do at night?
- Stop. Okay. I'm not doing

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.486
- a pizza competition.
- I'd understand why you would

01:13:15.488 --> 01:13:17.523
chicken out because really,

01:13:17.525 --> 01:13:19.959
she never was able
to compete at Leo's level.

01:13:19.961 --> 01:13:22.227
Wait. Whoa, whoa. whoa. What
do you mean "at Leo's level"?

01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:24.931
- Soccer. He was better.
- What soccer?

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.900
- She always won!
- Look, they've been

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:29.002
lifelong rivals,

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.404
and she's afraid
to go up against him.

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:33.373
- We're not rivals, all right?
- Yeah.

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.909
We were just competitive.
If we were rivals,

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.977
- I never would have let her win.
- Okay, let's be clear,

01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:40.149
nobody ever let me win.

01:13:40.348 --> 01:13:41.847
We gonna start with this again?

01:13:41.849 --> 01:13:43.216
You won when I let you.

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.490
Yeah, like you let
me win last night.

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:48.291
Oh!

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.529
Are we still
talking about soccer?

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.439
I'm really happy for you, Nonna.

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.542
Listen, honey,
you don't have to go.

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:10.211
- Hey, wait. Nikki...
- No! You know what?

01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:12.613
I am done waiting, Leo.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.916
You know, there's a reason
why they call it Little Italy...

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.519
because nothing
ever changes here.

01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:21.058
I mean, not our fathers
and their stupid fight...

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.060
and especially not you.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.874
<i>Paesano,</i> face it.
You're in love with Nikki.

01:14:38.876 --> 01:14:40.609
Always have been.

01:14:40.611 --> 01:14:43.011
But every time you come close
to doing something about it,

01:14:43.013 --> 01:14:44.547
you talk yourself out of it.

01:14:44.549 --> 01:14:46.948
"Oh, I can't be with Nikki.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:49.952
She's moving to London.
Oh, I can't be with Nikki,

01:14:49.954 --> 01:14:51.554
my dad will cut off
my giggle berries."

01:14:51.556 --> 01:14:54.289
It's too complicated,
all right? You know...

01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:56.994
This is for the best. Trust me.

01:14:56.996 --> 01:14:58.995
Those sounds like
the excuses of a man

01:14:58.997 --> 01:15:01.835
who's not being honest
with himself, huh? <i>Che parli?</i>

01:15:02.233 --> 01:15:05.601
Oh, I'm not being honest
with myself?

01:15:05.603 --> 01:15:08.305
Look, I'm not trying to be mean
or nothing, all right?

01:15:08.307 --> 01:15:11.176
But have you looked at yourself
in the mirror?

01:15:12.443 --> 01:15:14.477
Luigi, your real name

01:15:14.479 --> 01:15:17.317
is Lee Zhao Ping.
You're Chinese, bro!

01:15:17.616 --> 01:15:19.149
When will you be
honest with yourself

01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:20.186
that you're not even Italian?

01:15:31.163 --> 01:15:33.164
You know, when I told my dad

01:15:33.166 --> 01:15:34.568
I was gay, he...

01:15:36.135 --> 01:15:37.403
threw me out of the house.

01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:44.475
Will you still be my friend?

01:15:44.477 --> 01:15:47.349
Luigi, come on.

01:15:48.181 --> 01:15:50.349
You think I wouldn't be
your friend just 'cause,

01:15:50.351 --> 01:15:52.320
what, you like guys? So what?

01:15:52.653 --> 01:15:55.190
No. Because I'm not Italian.

01:15:57.324 --> 01:15:59.023
You know, when my dad,

01:15:59.025 --> 01:16:02.393
he threw me out, I walked
the streets for days, you know?

01:16:02.395 --> 01:16:04.298
And I ended up here,
pretty damn drunk.

01:16:05.065 --> 01:16:07.101
You know, the real Luigi,

01:16:07.502 --> 01:16:09.672
he took me in. He gave me a job.

01:16:10.705 --> 01:16:12.171
You know, I found a community

01:16:12.173 --> 01:16:14.276
that's crazy, chaotic...

01:16:15.343 --> 01:16:16.578
but lovable.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.712
You know,
when I was Lee Zhao Ping,

01:16:19.714 --> 01:16:21.383
I was an outcast.

01:16:23.017 --> 01:16:24.085
When I became Luigi,

01:16:25.654 --> 01:16:27.089
everyone accepted me.

01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:29.723
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I didn't know.

01:16:29.725 --> 01:16:31.294
- I didn't know.
- Ah, stop.

01:16:34.363 --> 01:16:36.396
You can either go after Nikki

01:16:36.398 --> 01:16:38.567
and open up your own shop,

01:16:39.067 --> 01:16:41.938
or hey, hey, you can
move to Chinatown.

01:16:43.372 --> 01:16:46.007
- Yeah, sure.
- <i>Mio amico,</i>

01:16:46.009 --> 01:16:49.046
you and Nikki, you're like
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

01:16:49.245 --> 01:16:51.212
Romeo and Juliet died.

01:16:51.214 --> 01:16:53.047
That's a bad example.

01:16:53.049 --> 01:16:54.117
You, uh...

01:16:56.386 --> 01:16:58.089
You're like Rocky and Adrian.

01:16:58.555 --> 01:16:59.788
- I'm not Rocky.
- No!

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:01.391
But you could be.

01:17:09.299 --> 01:17:10.398
Is your hand on my ass?

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.702
That's how Chinese people hug.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.481
I knew I'd find you here.

01:17:25.483 --> 01:17:27.019
Nonna knows.

01:17:27.651 --> 01:17:28.487
Yeah.

01:17:32.323 --> 01:17:34.526
I remember your confirmation.

01:17:35.126 --> 01:17:36.295
You stood right there.

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:41.664
It was a special day
for two reasons.

01:17:41.666 --> 01:17:45.335
One, because you chose
Saint Antonio, and...

01:17:45.337 --> 01:17:47.270
And I got my braces off.

01:17:47.272 --> 01:17:49.773
Look, there you are.
There's the smile, <i>bellissima.</i>

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:53.445
Come.

01:17:54.113 --> 01:17:55.382
Come, <i>bella.</i>

01:17:57.783 --> 01:17:59.352
So, tell me...

01:18:02.187 --> 01:18:03.390
What's in London?

01:18:04.757 --> 01:18:06.759
A new job. A new life.

01:18:07.326 --> 01:18:09.426
- No drama.
- Hmm.

01:18:09.428 --> 01:18:11.766
And this life over there,
it makes you happy?

01:18:14.767 --> 01:18:17.504
Oh, come here. It's good to cry.

01:18:17.803 --> 01:18:19.373
Washes the soul.

01:18:23.309 --> 01:18:24.512
Do you love him?

01:18:26.178 --> 01:18:27.313
It doesn't matter.

01:18:28.848 --> 01:18:32.150
Maybe it's time
you take a piece of prosciutto

01:18:32.152 --> 01:18:33.621
and you whack him over the head.

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.856
When I was little,

01:18:37.858 --> 01:18:39.792
you told me I should
never have to squeeze love

01:18:39.794 --> 01:18:41.627
out of a man's heart,

01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:43.294
that if it doesn't come freely,
I don't want it.

01:18:43.296 --> 01:18:46.167
I did? What else did I say?

01:18:47.401 --> 01:18:49.334
That boys are <i>stupido</i>

01:18:49.336 --> 01:18:51.537
and that I can do anything
better than they can.

01:18:51.539 --> 01:18:53.774
Ah. You see, I'm a wise woman.

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:56.509
In here,

01:18:56.511 --> 01:18:57.779
what do you want?

01:19:00.849 --> 01:19:02.318
I want to be happy.

01:19:03.252 --> 01:19:04.520
I want you all to be happy.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.457
And I...

01:19:09.190 --> 01:19:10.490
I guess I do want...

01:19:10.492 --> 01:19:11.360
Leo.

01:19:12.927 --> 01:19:13.695
Yes.

01:19:14.896 --> 01:19:17.300
If you have to leave,
you have to leave.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.438
But if this thing with Leo
is really love,

01:19:22.872 --> 01:19:24.541
it'll come and find you.

01:19:55.806 --> 01:19:57.241
You got something you wanna say?

01:20:01.978 --> 01:20:03.447
You got something you wanna say?

01:20:10.421 --> 01:20:11.753
You know what, Leo?

01:20:11.755 --> 01:20:13.691
The competition? It's on.

01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:16.462
Oh, so the chef
wants to make pizza?

01:20:20.397 --> 01:20:22.400
Okay, fine. Yeah, it's on.

01:20:27.304 --> 01:20:28.439
Wow, really?

01:20:29.974 --> 01:20:31.741
All right, fine. It's on.

01:20:35.947 --> 01:20:37.481
Come on down, everyone.

01:20:37.483 --> 01:20:39.749
- Join the party!
- Have some fun!

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:42.518
Today is Little Italy's
biggest day.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.821
Today, we crown
the winners of...

01:20:44.823 --> 01:20:47.624
Miss Little Italy Bikini.

01:20:47.626 --> 01:20:50.593
And of course, Little Italy's Mr. Bikini.

01:20:53.366 --> 01:20:55.599
Sorry.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:59.970
And of course, we also crown the
winner of Little Italy's Best Pizza!

01:20:59.972 --> 01:21:01.676
That's right!

01:21:02.508 --> 01:21:03.942
- Go get 'em, baby!
- Today's contest

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:06.010
- has two stages...
- You better pack your bags!

01:21:06.012 --> 01:21:09.546
...elimination and championship,
and only the top two can move on

01:21:09.548 --> 01:21:11.782
to the finals. Round 1.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.285
- Hey!
- Start the clock.

01:21:15.355 --> 01:21:19.524
Our contestants must
wow us with a pizza creation

01:21:19.526 --> 01:21:22.560
that looks and tastes original.

01:21:22.562 --> 01:21:25.064
- Yeah!
- Okay, folks!

01:21:25.066 --> 01:21:26.831
Now, let's give
a big hand to these chefs...

01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:44.818
Ten,

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.721
nine, eight, seven,

01:21:47.723 --> 01:21:50.556
six, five, four,

01:21:50.558 --> 01:21:53.295
three, two, one!

01:21:53.594 --> 01:21:56.630
Yeah, baby!

01:21:56.632 --> 01:22:00.566
- Oh, look what that guy did!
- <i>Paesano,</i> you got this!

01:22:00.568 --> 01:22:02.368
- You got this, baby!
- Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush!

01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:03.869
Here he comes.

01:22:03.871 --> 01:22:07.107
This was not easy, folks.

01:22:07.109 --> 01:22:10.043
Yeah. I mean, each of these
<i>pizzaiolos</i> is a master.

01:22:10.045 --> 01:22:12.879
But Johnny, we can
only choose two, huh?

01:22:12.881 --> 01:22:14.882
So, let's give
a big round of applause

01:22:14.884 --> 01:22:17.418
to our two finalists,
Leo Campoli

01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:20.791
- from Vince's "The Best"...
- And Nikki Angioli from Sal's "It's Better"!

01:22:21.957 --> 01:22:24.458
There's something more
than just a trophy at stake.

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:30.466
As we finally put an end to
Little Italy's oldest food fight.

01:22:31.402 --> 01:22:34.702
We are going to challenge
our finalists to cook

01:22:34.704 --> 01:22:36.772
- the queen of all pizzas...
- Hey!

01:22:36.774 --> 01:22:38.906
<i>La pizza Margherita!</i>

01:22:38.908 --> 01:22:41.543
Okay!

01:22:41.545 --> 01:22:44.612
...each pizza will
be judged by its crust,

01:22:44.614 --> 01:22:46.749
its sauce...

01:22:46.751 --> 01:22:48.920
- And above all... the taste.
- Oh! Ah!

01:22:50.086 --> 01:22:51.986
Stay focused, all right?
It's all up here.

01:22:51.988 --> 01:22:54.556
"Eye of the Tiger." You could
be champion of the world!

01:22:54.558 --> 01:22:55.528
It's yours.

01:22:56.494 --> 01:22:58.029
It's go time!

01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:04.466
- Go, Nikki!
- All right, son!

01:23:04.468 --> 01:23:05.637
Hey.

01:23:06.471 --> 01:23:07.940
- Good luck.
- You, too.

01:23:10.475 --> 01:23:13.076
- Okay, folks.
- Beautiful dough, Leo!

01:23:16.614 --> 01:23:18.046
Look how nice she rolls.

01:23:18.048 --> 01:23:19.785
Look how nice
she rolls that out.

01:23:20.652 --> 01:23:21.985
Yesterday at the church,

01:23:21.987 --> 01:23:24.622
I light not one candle, but two.

01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:26.122
Yeah, but darling...

01:23:26.124 --> 01:23:28.494
there can only be one winner.

01:23:33.833 --> 01:23:36.803
- Hey, that's my boy!
- Come on! What do you want, style points?

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:47.982
It's too bad there's
only going to be one winner.

01:23:53.653 --> 01:23:55.156
Look how beautiful
this is!

01:23:57.457 --> 01:23:59.826
- Down in front! Move it over!
- Hi. Hey. That's good.

01:24:01.228 --> 01:24:03.727
Nice!

01:24:03.729 --> 01:24:05.500
- Come on!
- Focus! Focus!

01:24:08.236 --> 01:24:11.070
All right, it's the home stretch!
Home stretch!

01:24:11.072 --> 01:24:14.943
While the pizzas are cooking, why
don't we do some cooking ourselves?

01:24:15.609 --> 01:24:20.079
Hey! Why don't we announce the
winner of this year's Miss Bikini?

01:24:26.554 --> 01:24:30.024
- And the winner of Mr. Little Italy...
- What?

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:37.934
Uh, you might wanna
just give it another second.

01:24:38.533 --> 01:24:40.200
I'm telling you, it's done.

01:24:40.202 --> 01:24:42.736
It's coming down
to the wire now, people!

01:24:42.738 --> 01:24:45.205
- See?
- Good call.

01:24:45.207 --> 01:24:48.174
- All right, baby!
- Ten, nine, eight,

01:24:48.176 --> 01:24:50.677
seven, six,

01:24:50.679 --> 01:24:52.646
five, four,

01:24:52.648 --> 01:24:54.747
three, two,

01:24:54.749 --> 01:24:56.887
One!

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.824
- Come on, Leo!
- Nikki!

01:25:01.091 --> 01:25:04.893
- Nicely done!
- They look great. Great!

01:25:04.895 --> 01:25:07.228
Please, Chef Nicoletta. Please.

01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:09.631
- Take to the stage.
- Thank you very much. Chef.

01:25:09.633 --> 01:25:11.265
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:25:13.235 --> 01:25:14.836
Oh! Looks good.

01:25:14.838 --> 01:25:17.037
Look at the bottom!

01:25:17.039 --> 01:25:18.974
What are you looking for,
a serial number? Just eat it!

01:25:18.976 --> 01:25:21.012
...matter which piece,
they're all perfect.

01:25:27.317 --> 01:25:28.950
- He likes it. He likes it!
- How do you know?

01:25:28.952 --> 01:25:30.054
- How do you know?
- The jacket's blooming.

01:25:31.789 --> 01:25:33.925
This side.

01:25:42.599 --> 01:25:43.935
Mm!

01:25:48.874 --> 01:25:50.640
Here we go. Here we go.

01:25:56.581 --> 01:25:57.948
All right. This was
a very difficult decision,

01:25:57.950 --> 01:26:00.616
but... the winner

01:26:00.618 --> 01:26:02.819
of Little Italy's Best Pizza

01:26:02.821 --> 01:26:03.721
is...

01:26:06.191 --> 01:26:08.326
Leo Campoli
from Vince's "The Best" Pizza!

01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:14.130
- Yeah! You did it!
- No!

01:26:14.132 --> 01:26:16.666
Leo! Leo! Leo!

01:26:16.668 --> 01:26:18.835
Leo! Leo! Leo!

01:26:18.837 --> 01:26:20.370
It was so close.

01:26:20.372 --> 01:26:22.839
The crust, the sauce!

01:26:22.841 --> 01:26:25.878
It reminded me of when
your fathers were together.

01:26:31.118 --> 01:26:32.253
Yeah, try it! Try it!

01:26:54.843 --> 01:26:57.210
Excuse me!

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.078
I'm sorry, but we can't
accept this trophy.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.948
Whoa, whoa! No, no, no! Wait.
Wait. We accept, we accept.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.684
Whoa! No, no, no. You heard what he said.
He can't accept. Nikki wins!

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.319
- You're not gonna steal this!
- "Steal"? Your own kid said it!

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:08.791
It wouldn't be right, Pa!

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:11.024
You don't understand!
It's not my pizza.

01:27:12.893 --> 01:27:15.263
Nikki, she must have
switched our sauce with theirs.

01:27:15.929 --> 01:27:19.065
That pizza, the winning pizza,
that's got my crust

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.401
and the Angioli family sauce.

01:27:23.039 --> 01:27:24.904
Can we get Nikki back up here?

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:27.708
- Nikki?
- She's gone, Leo,

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:29.079
to the airport.

01:27:32.014 --> 01:27:34.114
- Agh!
- Whoa, whoa.

01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:36.816
- Leo, wait a minute. Think about this.
- Where are you going?

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:39.086
- Take a guess.
- Go get her, kid!

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:41.224
Hey! Time for you to be Rocky.

01:27:46.263 --> 01:27:47.364
Adrian!

01:27:48.031 --> 01:27:49.798
Woo-hoo!

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.733
You destroyed your friendship,
we didn't say anything.

01:27:52.735 --> 01:27:54.736
You destroyed our business,
and we still didn't

01:27:54.738 --> 01:27:56.838
say anything, but this is
where we draw the line.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.740
You are gonna go to the airport

01:27:58.742 --> 01:28:01.175
and you are gonna fix this,
or you are gonna lose your kids!

01:28:04.247 --> 01:28:06.915
- <i>Andiamo!</i>
- Go, the two of yous!

01:28:06.917 --> 01:28:09.018

Yeah. That, too.

01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:42.213
- And you can go. Yeah.
- Yeah, you don't want her to go

01:29:42.215 --> 01:29:45.285
- to town on you with that latex glove.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

You got what you wanted.

01:30:10.312 --> 01:30:11.882
And I know what I want,
and it's in London.

01:30:12.347 --> 01:30:14.547
The only thing I want

01:30:14.549 --> 01:30:15.284
is you.

01:30:17.186 --> 01:30:20.290
Nikki, please! Stay.

01:30:21.056 --> 01:30:22.124
See what we could be.

01:30:23.959 --> 01:30:25.893
Girl, go to London.

01:30:25.895 --> 01:30:27.862
Don't change your plans
for no man.

01:30:27.864 --> 01:30:30.197
Nikki! Nikki!

01:30:30.199 --> 01:30:33.601
Nikki, what are you doing? Don't
let this <i>coccola</i> drive you away!

01:30:33.603 --> 01:30:35.636
She's not running away from him.
She's running away from you!

01:30:35.638 --> 01:30:36.971
Will you two be quiet?

01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:43.446
- Nothing is gonna change!
- Ah!

01:30:44.114 --> 01:30:45.482
Especially not them.

01:30:46.249 --> 01:30:47.882
It doesn't matter
about them.

01:30:47.884 --> 01:30:48.985
I've changed.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.923
And I'm not afraid
to tell you that

01:30:52.623 --> 01:30:54.058
I'm in love with you.

01:30:55.359 --> 01:30:56.394
I always have been.

01:30:57.929 --> 01:30:59.097
I always will be.

01:31:01.098 --> 01:31:02.597
I'm not afraid to tell my father

01:31:02.599 --> 01:31:05.001
that I want
to start my own shop.

01:31:05.003 --> 01:31:07.005
- What?
- It's about time!

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:13.109
I mean, all this time,
you never said anything,

01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:15.244
and now that I'm about to
get on a plane,

01:31:15.246 --> 01:31:17.579
you finally find the words.

01:31:17.581 --> 01:31:20.552
Love isn't words. It's actions.

01:31:21.319 --> 01:31:22.285
All right?

01:31:22.287 --> 01:31:23.956
That's why you let me win today.

01:31:25.591 --> 01:31:26.559
And you know what?

01:31:27.425 --> 01:31:29.492
I don't want us to have
to let each other win.

01:31:29.494 --> 01:31:32.297
I want us to both win. Together.

01:31:33.265 --> 01:31:34.500
Please, Nikki. Stay.

01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:37.136
Not for me,

01:31:37.603 --> 01:31:38.438
with me.

01:31:43.142 --> 01:31:44.211
What's it gonna be, girl?

01:31:52.051 --> 01:31:56.254
<i>This is the final

01:31:56.256 --> 01:31:58.659

01:32:08.569 --> 01:32:10.338
- Nikki.
- Then it's done.

01:32:12.205 --> 01:32:13.275
I think I'm gonna cry.

01:32:15.008 --> 01:32:16.043
Me, too.

01:32:24.752 --> 01:32:26.050
What?

01:32:26.052 --> 01:32:27.922
I had to get my luggage.

01:32:45.374 --> 01:32:47.175
I've loved you all my life.

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:51.280
Now, what are we gonna
do about them?

01:32:54.349 --> 01:32:56.750
Pa, Sal.

01:32:56.752 --> 01:32:58.386
Isn't it time you tell us
what this fight is all about?

01:32:58.388 --> 01:33:00.620
- No! No!
- No.

01:33:00.622 --> 01:33:03.192
- Yes!
- Or I'm getting on a plane with Nikki.

01:33:06.728 --> 01:33:09.231
Fine. Fine, do you wanna know?

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:11.766
All right.

01:33:11.768 --> 01:33:12.435
So, you wanna know.

01:33:14.370 --> 01:33:15.272
It's about them.

01:33:17.773 --> 01:33:18.710
Us?

01:33:22.645 --> 01:33:25.379
And the winner of The Best
Pizza of Little Italy is...

01:33:25.381 --> 01:33:28.482
Pizza Napoli!

01:33:28.484 --> 01:33:30.419
Hey, guys, give us the name
of your winning pizza!

01:33:30.421 --> 01:33:33.554
Wait, wait, wait.
We gotta think of a name.

01:33:33.556 --> 01:33:36.090
- It's easy. Pizza Franca.
- No, no, no. Wait.

01:33:36.092 --> 01:33:39.296
- It's better, uh... Pizza Carlo.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:33:39.829 --> 01:33:42.398
No. You see, my mother made
the award-winning sauce,

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.466
so it's Pizza Franca. Perfect.

01:33:44.468 --> 01:33:47.103
Yeah, but it's
my father's crust.

01:33:47.105 --> 01:33:49.639
Look at this. What is this?
Without my mother's sauce,

01:33:49.641 --> 01:33:51.710
this is nothing! This is
a McDonald's hamburger bun.

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:54.544
Well, your mother's sauce

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:56.778
without my father's crust,
you know what this is?

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:59.183
Campbell's Tomato Soup!

01:33:59.616 --> 01:34:00.519
Eat this!

01:34:04.489 --> 01:34:07.256
- I don't want a pizza named after me!
- Me neither.

01:34:07.258 --> 01:34:09.827
- We were just trying to show respect.
- Honor our families.

01:34:09.829 --> 01:34:12.429
What honor? So that some idiot

01:34:12.431 --> 01:34:15.298
could say that Carlo
was so cheesy,

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.800
he plugged me right up?

01:34:16.802 --> 01:34:20.339
Or even worse, I ate a Franca
for lunch two days in a row!

01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:24.307
Now, you two knuckleheads,
love and honor has nothing

01:34:24.309 --> 01:34:27.377
to do with your selfish pride,
or my crust!

01:34:27.379 --> 01:34:29.378
- Or her sauce.
- My sauce is very good.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.748
- Your sauce is delicious.
- Look at you two.

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:33.351
- It's the best.
- You were family. Family, huh?

01:34:33.353 --> 01:34:35.386
- Yeah.
- No, they were brothers.

01:34:35.388 --> 01:34:36.855
And for your information,

01:34:36.857 --> 01:34:40.225
- you truly are.
- That's right. Even now,

01:34:40.227 --> 01:34:41.860
more than ever.
He put a ring on it!

01:34:41.862 --> 01:34:43.494
I'm Beyonce.

01:34:43.496 --> 01:34:45.231
Oh, Papa!

01:34:45.898 --> 01:34:47.632
Nonna!

01:34:47.634 --> 01:34:48.699
- Call me Jay-Z.
- Oh, it's so wonderful!

01:34:48.701 --> 01:34:50.834
Oh, thank you! Oh!

01:34:50.836 --> 01:34:53.473
- Nonno!
- You know I love you, kid.

01:34:54.641 --> 01:34:56.377
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

01:34:59.212 --> 01:35:01.347
Aw!

01:35:01.349 --> 01:35:03.249
Yes, we do!
I love you, honey!

01:35:03.251 --> 01:35:05.450
Operations have resumed!

01:35:05.452 --> 01:35:08.353
All laptops, belts, shoes...

01:35:08.355 --> 01:35:09.623
Okay! Let's get out of here!

01:35:13.528 --> 01:35:15.197
Thanks. Just keep 'em
coming, Jessie.

01:35:15.863 --> 01:35:18.331
- Everything's good, yeah?
- It's perfect.

01:35:23.238 --> 01:35:26.406
And so our life in Little
Italy began all over again.

01:35:26.408 --> 01:35:27.810
A better version.

01:35:31.379 --> 01:35:33.746
- Chef, are you tearing up?
- Oh, good God, no.

01:35:33.748 --> 01:35:36.383
I'm British.
I just can't believe

01:35:36.385 --> 01:35:38.585
that I came all this way
to lure back

01:35:38.587 --> 01:35:40.289
my favorite student,
and I'm failing.

01:35:41.222 --> 01:35:43.424
- Gareth's menu didn't work out?
- Oh, on the contrary,

01:35:43.426 --> 01:35:45.193
it worked its way out

01:35:45.195 --> 01:35:47.461
of a top food critic's colon
so quickly,

01:35:47.463 --> 01:35:49.430
I was forced to shut down.

01:35:49.432 --> 01:35:51.265
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:35:51.267 --> 01:35:52.903
I'm sure you'll find
another concept you like.

01:35:56.405 --> 01:35:57.473
I think I just did.

01:35:59.241 --> 01:36:01.408
Are you interested

01:36:01.410 --> 01:36:03.810
in going international?

01:36:03.812 --> 01:36:05.779
Attention, single ladies!

01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:08.684
The bride's gonna
toss the bouquet!

01:36:08.686 --> 01:36:10.385
- Come on, Chef! Let's go!
- All right, come on!

01:36:10.387 --> 01:36:11.789
- Okay!
- Come on!

01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:16.594
- Go for the front!
- Oh! Oh!

01:36:21.831 --> 01:36:23.297
Oh, my God!

01:36:23.299 --> 01:36:25.300
- Hey!
- Stop it!

01:36:30.908 --> 01:36:34.310
Oh, Carlo! I've got
something to tell you.

01:36:34.312 --> 01:36:36.478
- What, honey?
- I'm pregnant.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.449
What? She says she's pregnant!

01:36:47.559 --> 01:36:49.525
- Jogi, may I have this dance?
- Me?

01:36:49.527 --> 01:36:51.294
- Yeah!
- Be gentle.

01:36:51.296 --> 01:36:53.632

01:39:31.862 --> 01:39:33.796
- Oh!
- You all right? We've still got time.

01:39:33.798 --> 01:39:36.832
You're drunk with me, aren't you?
I do this to you. Get over here.

<i>♪ Is all I need ♪</i>

01:39:45.478 --> 01:39:47.877
Maybe we should elope.

01:39:47.879 --> 01:39:50.983
Please! Will you mother
just leave?

01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:53.551
No more white people!

01:39:53.553 --> 01:39:55.985
- Woo!
- Whoa, baby!

01:39:55.987 --> 01:39:59.523

01:40:06.532 --> 01:40:09.034
Now, don't ask me
to go down on one knee.

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:10.968
As long as you don't ask me

01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:12.639
to go down on both later.

01:40:13.005 --> 01:40:15.410
- No, only all fours.
- Oh, <i>animale!</i>

01:40:16.609 --> 01:40:18.176
- No.
- Is there anything hard

01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:21.679
in there that I need
to know about? Even semi-hard?

01:40:21.681 --> 01:40:23.882
I'm just gonna check under
your shirt. I am right under

01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:26.250
that t-shirt and I'm just gonna
check close to your nipple.

01:40:26.252 --> 01:40:28.986
That is my nipple. There are
people watching us right now.

01:40:28.988 --> 01:40:30.990
I don't
do this normally!

01:40:30.992 --> 01:40:32.991
A penis sack.

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:35.898
