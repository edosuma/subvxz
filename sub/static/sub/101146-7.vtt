Well, I am.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.120
[bang, clattering]

17:44.000 --> 17:44.960
[shrieking]

17:45.040 --> 17:46.280
[woman whimpering]

17:48.360 --> 17:51.400
Boy, why am I looking at your face?

17:52.320 --> 17:54.000
Because I'm here to rescue you.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.920
I ordered you to stay back at camp.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.520
Today I shall kill paladins, my lord.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.880
Stay down here and out of trouble.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.480
Watch him and plug that damn hole.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.560
[grunts weakly]

18:18.760 --> 18:19.760
He's alive.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.840
[groans]

18:30.560 --> 18:31.840
[grunts weakly]

18:32.320 --> 18:33.400
[horse snorts, brays]

18:34.200 --> 18:35.400
[horse snorts]

18:39.960 --> 18:41.360
[horse brays]

18:47.520 --> 18:48.960
Bow. Give me a bow.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.520
[breathes sharply]

18:54.720 --> 18:56.480
[grunts, groans weakly]

18:57.920 --> 18:58.960
[strained breathing]

19:08.040 --> 19:09.440
[groans weakly]

19:18.120 --> 19:19.760
[Bergerum groans]

19:20.560 --> 19:22.960
-[groaning]
-Surrender the Green Knight...

19:23.040 --> 19:25.080
-[coughing]
-...we'll let the rest of you live.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.240
[Bergerum groans loudly]

19:28.640 --> 19:29.760
He's lying.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.400
[monk] Come, now, Green Knight,

19:32.640 --> 19:35.280
how many more will you make suffer
for your crimes?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.480
You see, I'm a patient man,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.640
and I'm willing to wait for you.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.480
But I will need to occupy my time.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.800
-[squelching]
-[pained screaming]

19:47.440 --> 19:49.120
[Bergerum groans loudly]

19:49.200 --> 19:51.240
[coughing, pained groaning]

19:51.320 --> 19:52.520
[groaning, coughing]

19:52.920 --> 19:54.680
[pained screaming]

19:55.040 --> 19:57.200
[Bergerum screams in pain]

20:00.280 --> 20:02.200
[pained screaming continues]

20:04.240 --> 20:05.400
Let me go.

20:05.480 --> 20:09.240
You said before, had you gone down there,
there'd be two dead Fey instead of one.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.160
I don't care.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.600
[monk] Let me explain how this works,
Green Knight,

20:14.880 --> 20:16.760
though I'm sure you can recall.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.640
To give you enough time,

20:22.320 --> 20:24.600
I'll slowly cut this fellow to pieces.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.280
[pained screaming]

20:28.480 --> 20:29.800
[pained screaming]

20:29.880 --> 20:32.120
[pained screaming]

20:32.640 --> 20:35.400
[Bergerum groans loudly, gasps for air]

20:36.520 --> 20:38.480
[pained screaming]

20:39.200 --> 20:41.160
I can at least take a few of them with me!

20:41.240 --> 20:44.160
Who would that save? Not Bergerum.
Not those poor souls downstairs.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.120
-I don't care!
-Then you're a fool!

20:46.200 --> 20:48.000
[Bergerum screams in pain]

20:48.080 --> 20:50.040
[Gawain] If you try to stop me again,

20:50.520 --> 20:51.760
I will kill you.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.200
[Bergerum gasps for air]

20:54.280 --> 20:55.720
[groans loudly]

20:57.280 --> 20:58.720
[Bergerum groans, coughs]

20:59.360 --> 21:00.600
[groans, coughs weakly]

21:02.480 --> 21:04.040
So, what now, Green Knight?

21:05.760 --> 21:07.320
Shall we untwist his stomach?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.520
[strained breathing]

21:12.640 --> 21:13.720
Yes?

21:13.800 --> 21:14.960
[monk] Is that a yes?

21:16.080 --> 21:18.000
[poignant music plays]

21:25.480 --> 21:26.520
[grunts quietly]

21:36.680 --> 21:38.600
[strained breathing]

21:39.480 --> 21:40.560
Take him.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.880
[weak groaning, strained breathing]

21:45.000 --> 21:45.920
[groans]

21:52.240 --> 21:54.040
-What have you done?
-[door closes]

21:55.560 --> 21:56.760
What had to be done.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.440
Honor Bergerum by saving lives,

22:12.440 --> 22:13.480
not wasting them.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.880
Ehh!

22:28.960 --> 22:29.880
[both laugh]

22:29.960 --> 22:30.920
[woman] Phillip.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.080
Can I have a look?

22:33.160 --> 22:34.480
No. Phillip!

22:35.640 --> 22:37.200
No more food.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.000
[man] You little rascal!

22:42.320 --> 22:44.000
[woman chuckles]

22:44.080 --> 22:45.720
Milady, you have a visitor.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.160
[man chatters indistinctly]

22:50.800 --> 22:52.480
[Phillip laughs]

22:54.320 --> 22:56.320
[distant chattering, laughter]

23:09.720 --> 23:10.720
Leave me.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.160
Your family seems well.

23:20.960 --> 23:21.960
They are.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.800
[distant laughter]

23:24.200 --> 23:26.720
[Merlin] Yours and their every need
has been tended to?

23:27.600 --> 23:30.080
Every one a peasant girl
could have thought to ask for.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.560
You acknowledge, then,
that I have kept my promises to you?

23:36.800 --> 23:39.120
The time has come
for you to keep your promise to me.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.360
[distant laughter]

23:49.720 --> 23:52.080
Can I host you for the night?

23:53.560 --> 23:54.720
Wine and pheasant?

23:57.440 --> 23:58.520
If I could just...

23:59.520 --> 24:01.600
spend one last evening with them?

24:01.960 --> 24:04.160
The fates of two kings
and thousands of lives

24:04.240 --> 24:06.360
hinge on our actions
in the next few hours.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.640
The hounds are at my heels.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.520
It must be now.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.680
Say your goodbyes.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.680
[poignant music plays]

24:25.840 --> 24:27.400
[distant laughter]

24:28.520 --> 24:30.880
-[Phillip laughs]
-Ooh-oh! Very good.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.680
[playful chattering]

24:36.280 --> 24:38.280
No. Let them play.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.240
[raider] Should've heard
the tonsured weasels!

24:44.320 --> 24:46.040
"The Pope will hear of this!"

24:46.520 --> 24:47.760
[raiders laugh]

24:48.480 --> 24:53.080
As your captain,
I declare open season on Red Paladins!

24:53.160 --> 24:54.920
[raiders roar approval]

24:55.000 --> 24:58.120
-[raider 2] Look at that!
-[raider 3] Thank you, clerics.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.680
[folk music plays]

24:59.760 --> 25:00.760
[raider 4] Yeah!

25:03.280 --> 25:04.800
[raider 4] For our captain!

25:04.880 --> 25:06.080
[raiders] Yeah!

25:10.640 --> 25:12.000
[raiders yell gleefully]

25:21.600 --> 25:23.160
[Morgana breathes heavily]

25:26.080 --> 25:27.880
-[mystical twinkling]
-[sighs]

25:29.480 --> 25:30.840
[ghostly voice] Morgana!

25:30.920 --> 25:31.960
[gasps]

25:36.400 --> 25:38.200
[breathes shakily]

25:38.880 --> 25:40.880
[ghostly whispering]

25:43.760 --> 25:45.080
[water sloshes]

25:47.440 --> 25:48.800
[breathes shakily]

25:51.200 --> 25:53.560
-[eerie whooshing]
-[ghostly voice] Morgana!

25:53.640 --> 25:54.760
[gasps]

25:57.200 --> 25:58.080
Kaze?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.560
[breathes shakily]

26:07.000 --> 26:08.560
[ominous music plays]

26:17.280 --> 26:18.400
Where is she?

26:19.040 --> 26:21.360
Morgana! Morgana!

26:21.440 --> 26:22.560
She will return here.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.240
She's my friend.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.360
She's one of many
that warned me against Merlin's treachery.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.080
Yeva...

26:39.000 --> 26:39.920
Gawain...

26:41.040 --> 26:42.840
[sighs] Everyone I trust.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.760
I had the sword.
I could have set all the terms.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.160
I could have forced him
to a place of my choosing,

26:52.240 --> 26:54.720
but instead, I went to him,
trusting, like a fool.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.480
Like a child.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.240
Merlin has made fools of kings,
popes, and Shadow Lords alike.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.280
None of them were his daughter.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.480
You are the daughter of Merlin?

27:14.200 --> 27:15.440
I wish it were not so.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.520
You must carry that secret to your grave.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.040
The Fey do not trust Merlin.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.480
Their faith in you cannot afford
to be shaken.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.960
What if that faith is misplaced?

27:35.520 --> 27:36.520
[Kaze] It is not.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.240
I still believe that.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.800
I'm not only Merlin's daughter,
I'm my mother's daughter.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.200
Unquestioning.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.600
Obedient.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.520
My mother thought
Merlin should have the sword,

27:51.600 --> 27:55.240
and so I ignored my eyes and guts
and just rode off to hand it to him.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.160
But instead,

28:02.160 --> 28:05.400
you gave it to the gray bats
at the bottom of this cursed cavern.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.440
I've counseled many leaders
from my own tribe and others.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.480
Those who do not doubt
are only pretending to lead.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.360
But I'm no king.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.480
Neither were they.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.600
My people are not led by kings.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.840
They are led by queens.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.080
[reverential music plays]

28:28.920 --> 28:30.880
Did these queens make mistakes?

28:33.400 --> 28:34.680
Not this bad.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.480
But you will learn.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.800
Maybe you will help teach me.

28:47.880 --> 28:48.880
We will see.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.560
[woman] Who's there?

28:58.160 --> 29:00.120
-Who is that?
-Stay back.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.160
Celia?

29:07.760 --> 29:08.800
[chuckles lightly]

29:10.080 --> 29:11.200
[gasps]

29:12.320 --> 29:13.480
-Oh!
-[Celia chuckles]

29:14.080 --> 29:16.040
It can't... It can't be.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.840
Don't press too roughly.
[chuckles lightly]

29:19.840 --> 29:21.240
Oh...

29:22.240 --> 29:23.200
Oh!

29:26.040 --> 29:28.440
-[breathes shakily] How can you be here?
-I...

29:28.840 --> 29:30.720
I barely escaped the fire.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.800
A few of us thought to hide down here.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.280
We remembered the place
from playing when we were young.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.240
I had given up, my love.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.280
[sniffles] Maybe the gods are merciful.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.440
[both chuckle]

29:45.000 --> 29:46.320
[Celia chuckles]

29:47.120 --> 29:48.280
[relieved sighing]

29:49.600 --> 29:51.320
[Morgana sniffles, sighs]

29:54.680 --> 29:56.360
[paladin] You've got to come out!

29:57.480 --> 29:59.120
[ominous music plays]

30:04.200 --> 30:05.480
[paladin] Burn it down!

30:08.680 --> 30:09.680
[man] Watch out!

30:12.240 --> 30:13.360
[paladin] Go!

30:14.360 --> 30:15.800
[breathes shakily]

30:15.880 --> 30:17.600
[arrows hit door]

30:17.680 --> 30:19.720
How many more of those arrows
do you think they have?

30:19.800 --> 30:21.480
As many as oil and cloth make.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.560
We'll burn before the sun sets.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.480
This place.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.640
I feel it studying me.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.680
Searching for weakness.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.360
Whatever is here,

30:38.320 --> 30:39.920
it senses your power.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.120
It fears you.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.040
[eerie whooshing, screeching]

30:52.120 --> 30:53.240
What about Morgana?

30:55.680 --> 30:57.480
No, you stay in this chamber.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.840
No, I'm not staying here.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.600
If you want to learn from me,
then listen first.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.400
This is the web of the Cailleach.
And she waits for us in the spiral.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.680
You're safer here.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.560
I will find Morgana and your sword.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.160
Do you remember Nimue?

31:24.480 --> 31:25.480
The Fey girl.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.840
They call her the Wolf-Blood Witch.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.960
She's rallying the tribes.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.760
I've made a vow
to support and protect her.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.080
[scoffs]

31:34.160 --> 31:37.320
You've always given yourself too fully
to the people you admire.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.840
Remember Sister Dawn?

31:40.080 --> 31:41.680
You stole jewels from the rectory

31:41.760 --> 31:44.160
because Sister Dawn said
God had sent her a dream

31:44.240 --> 31:47.000
that gems in her hand would protect us all
from the snowstorms.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.320
[both giggle]

31:50.920 --> 31:52.000
[Morgana giggles]

31:53.600 --> 31:55.960
Do you know who helped us
find each other again?

31:58.160 --> 31:59.280
It was the Cailleach.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.400
[Celia chuckles]

32:03.080 --> 32:04.440
Oh, I... I was afraid too.

32:04.520 --> 32:08.920
I thought the Cailleach was a monster,
but she saved me, Morgana.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.720
She brought me here to talk to you.

32:11.800 --> 32:12.800
I don't understand.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.400
She has a message for you.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.000
Your destiny is much greater
than you believe.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.720
See, you follow this one and that one
because you fear your own power.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.840
The Cailleach told me who would be
the greatest sorceress in Britannia.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.160
And it is not the Wolf-Blood Witch.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.040
It's you, Morgana.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.600
