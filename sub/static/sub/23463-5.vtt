00:30.060 --> 00:33.070
Flight takes many forms.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.470
It can be an unfurling of feathers,
a soaring upward into light,

00:37.520 --> 00:39.110
or a departure.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.550
Or running away -- a retreat from pain

00:42.600 --> 00:45.560
towards a distant joy we
cannot see for clouds.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.150
Flight can be

00:53.200 --> 00:56.280
such a very lonely enterprise.

Taxi to London Airport?

01:28.080 --> 01:29.840
Oh, Christopher!

01:35.200 --> 01:38.550
I would have been perfectly content
walking to the Commercial Road

01:38.600 --> 01:40.430
and flagging down a black cab.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.920
In those shoes? And with
this amount of luggage?

01:44.320 --> 01:47.270
My godmother made it very clear
that if I turn up at her house

01:47.320 --> 01:51.150
in Portofino with anything less
than four changes of clothes per day,

01:51.200 --> 01:54.120
plus matching accessories,
I'd be letting the side down.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.320
And I'm going there for months.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.000
How many months?

02:02.760 --> 02:04.280
I don't know.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.630
I haven't packed any winter clothes.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.520
The wardrobe's still bulging
with tweed and fur and gloves.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.920
I've even left behind my favourite
beaded cashmere sweater.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.070
I've no intention of still
being on the Italian Riviera

02:26.120 --> 02:28.000
by the time it's cold enough for that.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.150
Trixie, the moment you feel ready
to come home, you're to send me

02:32.200 --> 02:35.110
your flight details by telegram, and...

02:35.160 --> 02:36.830
.. I'll be waiting to collect you.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.630
Even if I have to borrow
Nurse Crane's snow chains

02:39.680 --> 02:41.320
and push the car all the way here.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.400
As a friend?

02:46.920 --> 02:49.080
Yes. Absolutely as a friend.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.310
Not so fast, young Beatrix Franklin!

02:54.360 --> 02:57.070
You're not doing us out of
the chance to say goodbye!

02:57.120 --> 02:59.790
And in honour of the occasion,
I am saying nothing about

02:59.840 --> 03:02.940
the pile of laundry you've chucked
in the corner of our bedroom!

03:04.440 --> 03:05.480
Take care.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.720
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.400
- Be safe.
- Bye, Val.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.950
I'll send you a postcard.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.310
Yeah, you better.

03:17.060 --> 03:18.160
Drive safely.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.600
Oh, don't do that, Michael.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.790
When's your next appointment?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.830
- What day is it?
- Tuesday.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.430
It'll be today, then.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.390
- Shouldn't they have told you where
you're going to have it by now? - Why?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.030
There's plenty of time.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.310
Let's hope. You haven't
even looked for a pram yet.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.550
All right. Will you stop going on?

03:56.600 --> 03:59.590
Well, there's no harm in
asking. Hospital or home?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.470
Let me know what they say.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.600
Be good for your mum.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.950
Oh, a letter personally addressed
to you, Sister Monica Joan.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.840
What news is this?

04:29.360 --> 04:32.560
Is that the appointment for
your cataract surgery, Sister?

04:38.880 --> 04:42.270
"And immediately there fell from his eyes

04:42.320 --> 04:43.800
"as it had been scales.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.400
"And he received sight forthwith."

04:54.600 --> 04:59.110
And remember -- with Nurse
Franklin's patients spread amongst us,

04:59.160 --> 05:02.750
it's economic with time
but thorough with care.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.670
We've been one woman down
before and we made it through.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.560
- Nil desperandum.
- Come on, then.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.630
He's in there! I can hear him.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.990
That's him! Go in after him.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.390
No, don't touch him!

05:28.440 --> 05:30.190
- Get out!
- Get him out!

05:30.240 --> 05:31.640
Got him.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.480
Get out. Out!

05:36.640 --> 05:37.540
No, please.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.150
Get out!

05:42.600 --> 05:45.630
- No, please!
- Get him off my ship!

05:45.680 --> 05:47.280
No! Please!

05:51.160 --> 05:52.590
Off and out to port.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.640
- Get off!
- Get off!

05:59.280 --> 06:02.790
I'm looking for my wife -- Eunice Dobson.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.080
Dobson?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.880
She said she had an appointment.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.430
Your wife's name is on our
books, but, from our records,

06:11.480 --> 06:13.950
it doesn't seem that she comes to clinic.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.110
Unless she's under the care
of St Cuthbert's, Mr Dobson?

06:17.160 --> 06:19.310
She says she's been coming here for weeks.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.830
It's her second and she's not far off.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.270
I see.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.310
Maybe with all this sun,
she decided to stay home.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.990
I'm sure there's some explanation.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.320
Explanation or none, I'll
add her to tomorrow's lists.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.950
Though what time we'll get
to you, I'm not quite certain.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.430
Then allow me, Nurse
Crane. I'm up that way.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.070
I can add her to my morning rounds.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.080
Oh. Thank you, Nurse Anderson.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.390
I'm looking for the Seamen's
Mission. C-Can you help me?

07:02.440 --> 07:03.840
I can't help you.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.790
I-I'm looking for the Seamen's Mission.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.830
Sorry, son. Get on your way.

07:09.880 --> 07:14.470
Excuse me, I-I'm looking for the
Seamen's Mission. Can you help me?

07:14.520 --> 07:15.750
Nah, I don't know it.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.590
Excuse me, sir, can you help me?

07:17.640 --> 07:19.600
I'm looking for the Seamen's Mission.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.670
E-Excuse me. I need help.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.840
Can you help me? I'm looking
for the Seamen's Mission.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.440
Over there.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.680
What do you want?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.830
How was the clinic? What did
they say to you this time?

08:20.880 --> 08:24.400
The usual -- baby's all
right, nothing to worry about.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.270
No, they didn't, Eun.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.000
Cos I went and you weren't there.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.669
You haven't been going, have you?

08:34.720 --> 08:36.590
I just don't see the point.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.559
What -- not a single appointment?

08:39.600 --> 08:42.510
With Michael, you were there
every week by this stage.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.800
Well, it's not like how
it was before, is it?

08:48.960 --> 08:50.280
How do you mean?

08:51.520 --> 08:55.510
I was having a baby, Kenny. I was happy.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.120
Because then I had no idea
what was facing me, did I?

08:59.680 --> 09:01.000
Now I do.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.550
Our Father, who art in heaven,

09:13.600 --> 09:15.830
hallowed be thy name;

09:15.880 --> 09:17.430
Thy kingdom come;

09:17.480 --> 09:19.840
Thy will be done; on
earth as it is in heaven.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.190
Give us this day our daily bread.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.670
And forgive us our trespasses,

09:26.720 --> 09:28.990
as we forgive those who trespass...

09:29.040 --> 09:31.120
Hey! What's up with you?

09:32.320 --> 09:34.640
Please... leave me.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.030
Eunice Dobson?

09:50.080 --> 09:51.760
I'm Nurse Anderson, a midwife.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.230
Is there any particular reason

09:55.280 --> 09:58.030
why you haven't been
to clinic, Mrs Dobson?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.960
No point. This one kicks
-- it's obviously growing.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.230
Now I'm here, we just need to
make sure everything is normal.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.950
Especially if you haven't
had any checks at all.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.790
Nurse, there's nothing wrong.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.550
I'm sure. But if I can take
your blood pressure now...

10:15.600 --> 10:18.670
- No. Don't touch me!
- Eunice, what is the matter with you?!

10:18.720 --> 10:20.230
Look, I'm fine.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.710
And if you think I'm going
anywhere near a hospital this time,

10:22.760 --> 10:24.550
you can forget it.

10:24.600 --> 10:28.430
I suggest your wife gets some
rest and I will call back later.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.430
We can talk further then and
make plans for the birth.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.200
Look, can you just go now, please?

10:42.880 --> 10:45.150
Thank you, Mrs Buckle.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.790
What's all that?

10:46.840 --> 10:49.710
Five minutes of filing,
according to Councillor Woodburn.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.750
Not to mention the fact
that he wants me to find

10:51.800 --> 10:54.830
the papers for the picnic fund
somewhere in this lot an' all.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.670
- The what? - Old Alderman Matchett
set up a charitable concern

10:58.720 --> 11:00.790
to raise money for the Poplar picnic.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.110
But he's been dead so long, and
now it seems they've got to

11:03.160 --> 11:04.870
spend the money by the end of the month,

11:04.920 --> 11:07.350
so if I don't find the
papers, then there's no money,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.070
and then there's no chance of a picnic.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.390
Well, you best get cracking, then!

11:11.440 --> 11:14.430
I remember the picnic being
the highlight of the year

11:14.480 --> 11:16.000
during my fair-haired youth!

11:17.240 --> 11:19.910
Well, it was for all of us.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.030
Imagine the memories for Reggie
-- a day out in the countryside,

11:23.080 --> 11:25.550
some games, apple cider!

11:25.600 --> 11:29.710
Ooh, and I remember your little pigtails!

11:32.280 --> 11:33.800
Ugh!

11:35.360 --> 11:39.790
Eunice Dobson's last labour
resulted in an assisted delivery --

11:39.840 --> 11:41.310
Simpson's forceps.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.990
That would have been very distressing.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.670
Yes. What happened when
you went to see her?

11:47.720 --> 11:51.550
She refused to be examined
and became quite upset.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.150
Were you not able to
give her any reassurance?

11:54.200 --> 11:56.310
She asked me to leave and
I thought it might be best

11:56.360 --> 11:57.680
if I did as she asked.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.790
It's not going to be
easy to gain her trust.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.030
I'm going to go back later
today and start afresh.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.520
God loves a trier!

12:07.520 --> 12:10.190
Spend as long as you can with her.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.950
Time isn't always a healer.
But it can open doors.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.040
I hope so.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.600
Most kind, Councillor Woodburn.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.790
Well, the good news is that
I've been through every document

12:28.840 --> 12:31.200
and there's nine and six
in the picnic account.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.390
So, why the long face?

12:34.440 --> 12:37.950
Apparently because yours truly
did such a good job organising

12:38.000 --> 12:40.630
the beauty contest,
Councillor Woodburn feels that

12:40.680 --> 12:44.840
if Poplar wants a picnic,
it's up to me to organise it.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.080
I got the train over from
Frinton at lunchtime.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.990
It's a good job our Kenny called me,

12:56.040 --> 12:58.480
cos she needs some sense talking into her.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.800
- What is it this time?
- Sorry to disturb you.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.990
But it is important
that we take your history

13:12.040 --> 13:13.740
and get these checks done for Baby.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.240
Perhaps if you and I can start again?

13:26.160 --> 13:29.990
A cup of tea and a few
liquorice torpedoes, anyone?

13:30.040 --> 13:32.150
Liquorice torpedoes?

13:32.200 --> 13:34.630
A thank-you present from Mrs
Hagger at the sweet shop.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.350
She gave me some violet creams as well,

13:36.400 --> 13:38.840
but I've put them in the
fridge in case they melt.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.590
Tea, Lucille?

13:41.640 --> 13:43.230
Tea?

13:43.280 --> 13:46.350
There's nothing more refreshing
in this kind of humidity!

13:46.400 --> 13:49.790
At home, we used to drink black
coffee with a dash of salt in it.

13:49.840 --> 13:53.240
Did that not have a deleterious
impact on the flavour?

13:54.440 --> 13:57.480
Possibly. But it cools you down!

13:59.520 --> 14:02.750
I wish I had a fan --
a proper, fold-out one,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.100
like my Auntie Priss had.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.710
I'm not working up much of a
breeze with my Myles Midwifery.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.200
What is it you're
worrying your head about?

14:12.640 --> 14:13.680
Eunice Dobson.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.950
I've never met a woman
so adamant that she can't,

14:18.000 --> 14:19.910
and won't, give birth.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.070
If I had a penny for every woman
who's shouted, "I can't do this!"

14:23.120 --> 14:25.350
when she gets to the
sharp end, I'd have...

14:25.400 --> 14:30.710
ooh, er, 29 bob and 11 pence by now!

14:30.760 --> 14:36.150
It is very common during labour.
But unusual beforehand, I grant you.

14:36.200 --> 14:41.070
And she is so vehement and so distressed.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.270
It really worries me.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.800
It sounds like she needs a good
sit down with Nurse Reassurance.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.870
You listen to what she has to say.
See if the notion of a home birth,

14:52.920 --> 14:56.240
in familiar surroundings,
will help calm her nerves.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.830
No, no. Please. No, please!

15:07.880 --> 15:11.000
Come on! Who do you think you
are -- the invisible man?

15:15.280 --> 15:16.350
Pox!

15:16.400 --> 15:18.520
Pox! Pox!

15:40.880 --> 15:42.310
Sorry to interrupt, ladies.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.030
Please don't apologise. I'm
sure it's an emergency.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.270
Until further notice,
we have to assume so.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.230
Apparently a Nigerian
national -- a sailor --

15:51.280 --> 15:53.640
was run out of the Seamen's
Mission last night.

15:54.840 --> 15:58.510
It seems he may have been
suffering from smallpox.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.110
Oh, no!

16:00.160 --> 16:04.150
I thought we'd put all that to
bed after last year's carry on!

16:04.200 --> 16:06.840
Witnesses said his face was badly marked.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.830
Have you notified the Officer for Health?

16:11.880 --> 16:14.710
Yes. And the police are
on the lookout for him.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.070
His name is Ade Babayaro.

16:18.620 --> 16:19.590
There'll be rumours flying around

16:19.640 --> 16:21.840
before the bobbies even
get their boots on.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.790
What shall we tell our
patients if they ask?

16:24.840 --> 16:27.030
Or if they start demanding vaccinations?

16:27.080 --> 16:29.990
People think there's a vaccination
for everything these days.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.790
Well, there is one for smallpox.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.150
But we can't launch it
until this man is found

16:34.200 --> 16:36.950
and his illness is confirmed.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.870
All anyone can do in the
meantime is be vigilant.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.870
For sightings of the sailor?

16:41.920 --> 16:44.590
Or signs of the disease in others.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.800
We don't know where he's
been or where he may go next.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.630
Welcome home, Reggie.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.630
- Hello, Mum!
- Oh!

17:34.680 --> 17:36.910
Oh, you look so skinny
-- there's nothing of you!

17:36.960 --> 17:38.310
Still smell nice, though.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.750
So do you!

17:39.800 --> 17:42.110
Right, young fella, what's
it to be -- toast or crumpets?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.150
Oh, it's already sorted.
That's all sorted.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.230
I've done you some bacon butties
-- they're in a tray in the oven.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.110
Just a quick breakfast,
please, and then straight out.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.640
Cos I need you two on publicity duty.

17:54.280 --> 17:58.270
For this picnic, it's all
hands on deck. See you later...

17:58.320 --> 17:59.360
Alligator!

18:16.000 --> 18:17.040
Eunice?

18:19.840 --> 18:22.440
Look, love. I've finished it.

18:33.720 --> 18:37.030
Eunice... tell me how you really feel.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.150
If I may have your attention, please.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.070
When are we being vaccinated?
That's all I want to know.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.870
It's not as simple as
vaccinations, Mrs Lawrence.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.030
Why not?

18:56.080 --> 18:57.590
He's had the polio sugar cube.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.110
Why can't he have the smallpox one?

19:00.160 --> 19:02.590
People died in Bradford last year.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.310
Because until the Board of
Health have confirmed the case...

19:05.360 --> 19:06.870
What's to confirm?

19:06.920 --> 19:09.630
There's smallpox in Sweden
-- I read it in the paper.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.230
Ain't that where that sailor came from?

19:12.280 --> 19:14.270
To put your minds at rest,

19:14.320 --> 19:17.670
smallpox does not spread
that easily by itself.

19:17.720 --> 19:22.470
You would need to be very close to
the sailor to catch it yourselves.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.430
Now, unless you're here
with a genuine condition,

19:25.480 --> 19:26.880
I suggest you go home.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.120
Dear Jesus... please help me.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.520
I tried keeping it to myself.

20:10.680 --> 20:16.270
Let me guess -- the bigger Baby
gets, the more fear there is?

20:16.320 --> 20:17.840
I didn't mean for it to happen.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.240
I wouldn't let Kenny
touch me for two years...

20:24.400 --> 20:26.400
.. and then we did and the whatsit split.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.680
The sheath?

20:29.840 --> 20:31.640
I even tried to get rid of it.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.960
One of them dentists near Limehouse.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.880
But I couldn't let him near.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.150
Not after what happened
last time at that hospital.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.240
I just couldn't!

20:49.840 --> 20:51.800
What did happen last time, Eunice?

20:52.840 --> 20:54.640
If you tell me, I can try to help.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.240
The baby was stuck.

21:01.680 --> 21:05.990
The next thing, the doctor came
in and my legs were strung up...

21:06.040 --> 21:07.560
He intervened?

21:08.840 --> 21:12.910
He... stuck them metal
things inside me, Nurse,

21:12.960 --> 21:15.070
and I was screaming.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.110
All right, Eunice.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.190
But he just kept on pulling.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.550
He was ripping it out of me!

21:21.600 --> 21:23.120
I shouted for him to stop!

21:24.880 --> 21:29.230
Eunice. Eunice, now, Michael's out
there -- you need to calm down!

21:29.280 --> 21:30.880
Why wouldn't he stop?

21:34.080 --> 21:36.390
Maybe cos that's what happens, love.

21:36.940 --> 21:38.630
This doesn't help!

21:39.080 --> 21:40.600
Pamela, please!

21:56.600 --> 21:58.590
I love it.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.310
But I can't have it!

22:01.360 --> 22:02.600
Now, listen to me.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.310
As sure as night turns to day,
your baby is going to be born --

22:08.360 --> 22:10.350
right here, at home.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.000
And I will be there to support
you the best I know how.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.350
Well, you're going to have
to think of something, Nurse.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.120
Because I'm not having this baby.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.950
Don't tell me -- the rest of the dockers

22:31.000 --> 22:32.430
have taken a vow of abstinence.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.590
No, love. But rumour has it

22:34.640 --> 22:38.350
that smallpox sailor slept
rough by my bins last night!

22:38.400 --> 22:40.950
It's been like a ghost town in here since.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.310
Why? The dockers were vaccinated
because of that outbreak last year.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.470
It's not them they're
worrying about, is it?

22:46.520 --> 22:47.870
It's their wives and kids.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.310
And if he's not found soon,
we'll find him ourselves.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.480
That won't be pretty.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.910
I can appreciate the concern,
but the police are searching

22:59.960 --> 23:02.670
and all guidelines are being
followed to the letter.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.070
I should bloody well hope so.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.510
Anyway, it's that box of tin
plates you promised to Violet

23:07.560 --> 23:09.150
for the picnic that we've come for.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.510
Picnic? While I've got an
empty pub to worry about?

23:12.560 --> 23:13.600
You can whistle.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.960
That sailor needs to be found.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.990
After all, the man is out
there alone somewhere, sick,

23:28.040 --> 23:31.000
in pain and undoubtedly
scared for his life.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.750
Chara leaves from Nonnatus.
Vi's organising it.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.960
All welcome!

23:40.960 --> 23:44.880
The charabanc's on order, so all set
for an early start to Epping Forest.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.950
So, what I need you to do is chivvy along

23:48.000 --> 23:51.190
all the shopkeepers in
Poplar, cos we need donations.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.910
Then I want you to collect
from your given area

23:53.960 --> 23:57.670
and bring everything here to Picnic HQ.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.910
While we're collecting,

23:58.960 --> 24:01.630
you'll be glad to know that Fred's
going to be doing the posters

24:01.680 --> 24:06.390
and the trestle tables, benches,
camping chairs and tents.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought
this was meant to be teamwork.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.710
Well, it is. Someone's
got to be in charge.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.160
Ain't they, Reggie?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.670
You're still here, Dr Turner.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.870
For a good while yet.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.470
I was wondering if you had
a moment for some advice.

24:24.520 --> 24:28.830
Why not? It's what everyone
else is asking for today.

24:28.880 --> 24:32.150
Patients have taken up more
time enquiring about rumours

24:32.200 --> 24:35.200
of the smallpox sailor than the
symptoms they came in with.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.470
I'm sure you were able to
reassure them, Dr Turner.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.670
I only wish I could
reassure Eunice Dobson.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.190
She's suffering such anguish --

24:45.240 --> 24:47.390
so terrified of another forceps delivery

24:47.440 --> 24:49.880
that she doesn't want to give birth.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.510
I'm not sure what else I can do alone.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.430
Then why don't we both go to see her?

24:56.480 --> 25:00.710
How about tomorrow evening?
I'll make an assessment.

25:00.760 --> 25:05.830
Thank you, Doctor. I dislike the
notion of any patient being scared.

25:05.880 --> 25:10.200
Same here. Unfortunately,
right now, many are just that.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.550
I'm taking this lot to the institute,

25:34.600 --> 25:36.910
so can you take this loaf straight home?

25:36.960 --> 25:39.760
- Cos Fred might need it for his tea.
- Aye-aye, captain.

25:41.520 --> 25:46.080
Oh, Mr Palmer, thanks so much
for the flasks. Most kind.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.080
Hello?

26:24.600 --> 26:27.080
No, please... do not go near me.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.560
I am sick.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.950
Are you hungry?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.150
I am hungry...

26:35.200 --> 26:37.040
.. but you must not come near me.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.720
Thank you.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.840
You are a good man.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.510
But, please, you should go from me now.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.880
If they find you with me,
they'll chase you too.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.040
I get chased.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.040
I'm Reggie.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.000
My name is Ade, but I
cannot shake your hand.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.320
I need help.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.640
But you must keep it a secret.

27:39.320 --> 27:42.760
I know a forceps delivery
can be very traumatic.

27:44.600 --> 27:47.470
But the chances of needing assistance

27:47.520 --> 27:49.710
with a second baby are far less.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.150
Did you know that?

27:51.200 --> 27:52.670
I don't want to talk about it!

27:52.720 --> 27:56.990
I really believe that we can make
things better for you this time.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.910
Do you?

27:58.960 --> 28:00.630
Cos I don't.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.200
Eunice! Don't talk to
the doctor like that!

28:07.440 --> 28:10.590
It's like there's this
film in my head and it...

28:10.640 --> 28:13.150
.. keeps playing and playing.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.790
Same thing, over and over.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.200
I'm trying to switch it off all day.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.790
All night!

28:20.840 --> 28:22.590
And it keeps coming back on again?

28:22.640 --> 28:23.720
Yes!

28:31.440 --> 28:33.320
What happens in the film, Eunice?

28:34.600 --> 28:36.560
I'm looking at the ceiling of the room.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.670
The lights are in my
eyes. And I can't move.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.800
I can't move. I can't move.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.710
And they come at me and I
hear the metal clanging!

28:49.760 --> 28:52.670
It's all right, Eunice. It's all right.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.110
We can help you.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.430
I've had the sort of help
that people like you give me

28:56.480 --> 28:57.680
and I don't want it!

29:00.800 --> 29:02.830
There's got to be another way around this.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.910
There's a fella at work

29:03.960 --> 29:05.990
whose wife had something
called a Caesar section.

29:06.040 --> 29:10.360
A Caesarean is only carried out
when the mother's life is at stake.

29:11.360 --> 29:14.400
Eunice's problem isn't with
her pregnancy, but her mind.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.000
- Eunice?
- Go away!

29:19.560 --> 29:21.230
I'm sorry, Doctor.

29:21.280 --> 29:24.350
Her mother didn't bring her up to
have things wrong with her mind,

29:24.400 --> 29:27.200
or to make a load of fuss about nothing!

29:28.240 --> 29:29.830
She'll just have to get on with it.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.110
Eunice can't just "get on with it",

29:33.160 --> 29:35.400
because, for her, this
isn't about nothing.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.150
She is clearly suffering from a phobia --

29:40.200 --> 29:42.840
an overwhelming fear of childbirth.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.040
And she is going to need an
enormous amount of support.

29:53.880 --> 29:57.560
Dundee cake for you, Ade.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.960
Thank you.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.790
32...

30:25.840 --> 30:31.550
33 packets of biscuits,
13 of which are chocolate.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.910
It's going to be like Billy Bunter's
birthday party come this weekend!

30:34.960 --> 30:37.680
Good, cos there's nothing
worse than a feeble spread.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.470
Where's the Dundee cake, Reggie?

30:42.520 --> 30:44.470
Secret.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.350
What do you mean, "secret"?

30:46.400 --> 30:49.560
It's a secret with my friend.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.280
What friend?

30:54.520 --> 30:56.080
Where've you been, Reggie?

30:57.120 --> 30:58.520
Who's taken your cake?

30:59.880 --> 31:02.400
And who's asking you to keep secrets?

31:03.960 --> 31:06.280
You won't be in any
trouble, Reggie, we promise.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.030
♪ I like it, I like it

31:15.080 --> 31:20.310
♪ I like the way you run
your fingers through my hair

31:20.360 --> 31:22.000
♪ And I like the way... ♪

31:36.080 --> 31:39.470
- I know you've spoken to
that man, Reggie. - Ade?

31:39.520 --> 31:45.230
Yes, Ade. And I know that
you've given him presents.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.430
But when you handed him the
food, did you touch him?

31:48.480 --> 31:50.430
Tell the doctor the truth, Reggie.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.110
Smallpox is spread by touching.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.950
He hasn't got a temperature and
there's no sign of any rash,

31:57.000 --> 31:58.750
so we don't need to worry yet.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.390
Ah. I'm worried silly already, Doctor.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.550
Am I in trouble?

32:04.600 --> 32:06.270
You were being kind.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.280
No-one ever gets in trouble
for being kind, Reggie.

32:10.280 --> 32:14.590
But if you could remember where
he was when you found him,

32:14.640 --> 32:17.080
that would be really
helpful for a lot of people.

32:21.360 --> 32:24.070
I will see Reggie again in two days,

32:24.120 --> 32:27.070
unless he develops
symptoms in the meantime.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.190
Thank you, Doctor.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.280
Or if he gives you any more information.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.390
Oh, dear! Is someone
feeling under the weather?

32:38.440 --> 32:39.750
Not yet!

32:39.800 --> 32:43.030
We think Reggie's been in
contact with the smallpox case.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.950
Reggie! Really?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.680
Not saying.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.990
He'll be having his wings
clipped until further notice.

32:51.040 --> 32:54.830
And he certainly won't be going
out with a cake tin under his arm!

32:54.880 --> 32:58.830
You were wise to consult Doctor.
But I'd counsel against panic.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.310
Well, you say that.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.950
But you weren't the one that
set him up to be preyed on!

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Sh, sh, sh, it's all right.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.190
I knitted the same for
Michael when he was born

33:13.240 --> 33:15.230
and that didn't end up in the bin!

33:15.280 --> 33:17.110
Mum! She's in no fit state!

33:17.160 --> 33:19.350
Well, she needs to buck
up, then, doesn't she?

33:19.400 --> 33:21.990
She's known for nine months
this was going to happen

33:22.040 --> 33:24.510
and now she's expecting
some sort of miracle.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.950
There's only one way in and one way out.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.120
Please, can you just leave me alone?

33:32.320 --> 33:34.510
You heard what she said, Mum.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.360
I'll take you to the station
first thing in the morning.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.950
I'm just dropping off the
insulin for the evening rounds.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.230
You've picked a nice spot
for your perusals, Lucille.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.110
Oh, it catches the sun in the evening --

33:58.160 --> 34:00.240
it reminds me of the porch back home.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.640
Right, I'll be two ticks!

34:04.880 --> 34:07.750
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr Turner.
Have I detained you?

34:07.800 --> 34:11.120
Oh, no. I... I just need to get
back to call the Board of Health.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.239
There still seems to be no
sign of this smallpox patient.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.560
Please, God, do not forsake me.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.199
Do not let me die in this terrible place.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.390
Good morning, Reggie.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.310
Dr Turner asked me if I'd
call in on my rounds.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.030
Would you like a cup of tea, Nurse Crane?

35:15.080 --> 35:18.310
There's one in the pot. I've been
keeping Reggie's fluid levels up.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.950
I am sufficiently watered, thank you.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.800
Oh! That'll be a customer.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.120
Right, lad.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.150
We're good pals, you and I.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.550
And if there's one thing
neither of us like,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.510
it's a lot of fussing and fretting.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.910
That's two things.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.640
Well, yes.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.750
Meanwhile, the easiest way
to get everyone to calm down

35:46.800 --> 35:49.640
is for you to tell us where
we can find your friend.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.350
It's a secret.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.590
I understand.

35:55.640 --> 35:59.870
And I've kept secrets for friends
because I want to help them.

35:59.920 --> 36:04.590
But sometimes, in order
to really help someone,

36:04.640 --> 36:07.840
you have to break your promise
and bring other people in.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.120
You can just whisper it. I'll do the rest.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.030
(Underground. Underground.)

36:19.080 --> 36:21.440
Oh... thank you.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.840
Please help him.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.720
Mr Babayaro?

37:12.080 --> 37:13.480
Mr Babayaro?

37:32.480 --> 37:35.270
Forgive my intrusion, sir,
but I've been led to suppose

37:35.320 --> 37:37.820
that you would benefit
from medical assistance.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.160
Put more plainly, that you need help.

37:46.120 --> 37:50.040
I'm Nurse Crane. And I'm here
on my own -- don't worry.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.840
If you would let me look at
you, we can work out what to do.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.240
No. Please, no.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.800
You will catch this.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.240
Not necessarily.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.040
Smallpox is a very bad illness.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.800
Don't send me home.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.600
I have no home, nowhere to go.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.920
You reckon this is smallpox, do you?

38:39.720 --> 38:43.080
Well... I'm taking you to see a doctor...

38:45.000 --> 38:46.680
.. but I reckon differently.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.120
Dr Turner? I've found him.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.470
Ade Babayaro is currently
concealed in my car

38:56.520 --> 38:58.710
and hidden with a travel rug.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.670
Then keep him there.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.590
I'll bring the medical officer
and their dermatologist.

39:03.640 --> 39:07.790
In my humble opinion,
this is not a case of

39:07.840 --> 39:09.960
what all and sundry presumed it was.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.080
God has heard my prayers.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.400
There was smallpox in our last port, sir.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.110
The men on the ship
believed this was the same.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.600
I also believed it.

40:14.720 --> 40:18.280
This isn't smallpox, Mr
Babayaro, and it never was.

40:19.320 --> 40:22.360
As the medical officer
confirmed, you have leprosy.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.190
Leprosy is also a very bad illness.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.350
In the Bible...

40:28.400 --> 40:30.720
We've moved on since the
Bible, I promise you.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.440
And leprosy isn't as
contagious as we used to think.

40:36.880 --> 40:41.400
It even goes by a different name
these days -- Hansen's disease.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.430
But you can help me?

40:44.480 --> 40:47.550
Better than that. We can cure you.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.990
There's even a small specialist
hospital, called Jordan's,

40:51.040 --> 40:52.950
not far away in Surrey.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.710
You should be a new man by the
time they've finished with you.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.270
How long must he wait to be admitted?

40:59.320 --> 41:01.350
Not long. Perhaps a few days.

41:01.400 --> 41:05.510
I will go back to where I
was before. I wait there.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.110
If I may interject, Mr Babayaro,

41:08.160 --> 41:10.990
I'm of the view that that would be unwise.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.070
Nurse Crane is right.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.950
We have a spare bedroom.
You may stay there

41:16.000 --> 41:20.070
and enjoy the peace and quiet
whilst you wait to be transferred.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.710
Perfect!

41:21.760 --> 41:25.030
And I can call in, in the
event of any problems.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.720
You may take meals with us, if you wish.

41:28.880 --> 41:32.240
No. With your permission,
it is best I eat alone.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.950
Vi?

41:44.000 --> 41:48.030
Guess what -- that sailor didn't
have smallpox. He had leprosy.

41:48.980 --> 41:50.010
A leper?

41:50.560 --> 41:53.070
Well, don't they send
them away to a colony?

41:53.120 --> 41:55.350
Not any more. He's seen a specialist

41:55.400 --> 41:58.110
and apparently leprosy is not contagious.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.150
There's no chance Reggie caught a thing.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.710
Oh! Thank goodness for that.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.510
Can Ade come on the picnic?

42:04.560 --> 42:06.310
Er, no, Reggie, no, not this time.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.310
He's got to get himself better first.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.550
Oh, cheer up, Reggie.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.390
Look -- my to-do list
is as long as my arm!

42:16.440 --> 42:17.680
I need your help.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.400
If I die...

42:30.520 --> 42:33.670
.. I know you will continue to bless me,

42:33.720 --> 42:35.000
to be there with me.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.150
I want to say thank you
for guiding me everywhere,

42:39.200 --> 42:41.520
and what I have been through.

42:42.920 --> 42:46.320
Thank you for... protecting me.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.920
Forgive me, Sister. I am sorry.

42:55.840 --> 42:59.110
"There came a leper to
him, beseeching him,

42:59.160 --> 43:03.110
"and kneeling down to
him, and saying unto him,

43:03.160 --> 43:06.360
" 'If thou wilt, thou
can make me clean.' "

43:07.440 --> 43:10.960
You have been cast out
because of your infirmity.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.760
I was cast out before that.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.630
It is my life to walk alone.

43:18.680 --> 43:19.720
How so?

43:21.240 --> 43:23.640
Oil was found near my home in Nigeria.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.230
My father was an elder

43:27.280 --> 43:30.040
and when they came for the
oil, there was conflict.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.920
My escape was to go to Lagos and to sea.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.990
So I lived, but I was cast adrift.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.070
Ah.

43:43.120 --> 43:48.120
We are none of us cast
adrift, if we have faith.

43:50.320 --> 43:54.760
In the cross, we find our anchor.

44:02.560 --> 44:07.120
And don't forget, the charabanc
leaves at eight o'clock!

44:09.120 --> 44:10.480
It's upside down.

44:11.560 --> 44:14.030
Quick -- give me another one.

44:14.080 --> 44:17.430
And don't tell Vi! Anything
goes wrong with this picnic,

44:17.480 --> 44:19.360
she'll have my guts for garters.

44:22.520 --> 44:26.030
Ade continues to have a good
appetite. He has cleared his plate.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.870
I'm sure you'll all be delighted
to know that a suitable place

44:28.920 --> 44:31.310
has been found for our newest resident.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.670
Ah, does that bring us to
the unfortunate position

44:33.720 --> 44:36.040
that Mr Babayaro will be leaving us?

44:37.360 --> 44:42.590
The connection between our
devotionals has been most uplifting,

44:42.640 --> 44:45.630
and in such a brief time.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.750
It does indeed, Sister.

44:47.800 --> 44:51.870
Ade will be admitted to Jordan
Hospital in Surrey tomorrow.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.950
There he will receive the
treatment he so requires.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.630
And he's likely to make
a full recovery, Sister?

44:58.680 --> 45:00.790
Or will he always be marked?

45:00.840 --> 45:06.560
The scarring is unknown. But in
time, Ade will eventually be cured.

45:08.920 --> 45:12.960
In my book, such positive news calls
for another slice of Madeira cake.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.160
Eun?

45:33.680 --> 45:34.720
Eunice?

45:41.040 --> 45:42.080
Eun?

45:44.960 --> 45:47.990
Eun? What... What you
doing? Open the door, love.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.080
- Let me in.
- No.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.400
It's started, Kenny...

45:53.720 --> 45:56.000
.. and I can't do it. I'm not coming out.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.910
Eunice, open this door.

45:59.960 --> 46:02.560
Come on, love. We don't want
to wake Michael up, do we?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.030
No.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.280
I'm not doing it, Kenny. I can't.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.430
Please don't do anything
stupid, love, all right?

46:12.480 --> 46:14.000
I'm going to get some help, OK?

46:25.040 --> 46:29.070
Is that Nonnatus House?
It's my wife, Eunice Dobson.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.190
She's locked herself in the bathroom.

46:31.240 --> 46:32.790
I think she might try and hurt herself.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.750
You've got to send Nurse Anderson.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.790
I'm not going to need any help, Kenny.

46:36.840 --> 46:38.910
Call Dr Turner and tell
him what's happened.

46:38.960 --> 46:41.200
- Perhaps he can meet me there.
- Of course.

46:46.720 --> 46:51.070
Eunice... I love you. You know that.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.080
Michael loves you and I love you.

46:54.320 --> 46:55.960
You'll be better off without me.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.750
No! Eun!

47:05.520 --> 47:07.670
Nurse Anderson asks if
Dr Turner could meet her

47:07.720 --> 47:09.710
at Eunice's flat right away.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.520
I think I'll come too. I
might be of some help.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.510
Please let me in. You
need my help in there.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.230
Listen to her, Eun! She
knows what she's doing.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.920
No! Stay away from me, all of you.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.720
It's coming and there's nothing I can do.

47:32.280 --> 47:34.040
I want it over, Nurse!

47:35.600 --> 47:36.910
Oh, I'm so...

47:36.960 --> 47:39.000
Eunice. Please, don't do this.

47:40.440 --> 47:43.600
I can help you, but first you need
to calm down and open this door.

47:45.560 --> 47:48.070
Nurse, I need to get her out of there.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.120
One more try. We don't want to alarm her.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.720
Eunice...

47:54.840 --> 47:57.280
No matter what you do,
Baby will come out anyway.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.150
And it will be so much worse
that way. Do you hear?

48:01.200 --> 48:03.400
You don't want to hurt
Baby, do you, Eunice?

48:05.440 --> 48:07.910
You love your baby. You remember that?

48:10.040 --> 48:11.870
Let me kick the door down.

48:11.920 --> 48:15.000
Kenny, why don't you take a
break and let me talk to her?

48:19.560 --> 48:21.560
It's just you and me now, Eunice.

48:23.160 --> 48:25.590
And I'm sure your
contractions are very painful.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.520
If you come out, I'm here.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.560
I can help you cope with them.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.560
Eunice...

48:46.640 --> 48:49.520
Now all you need to do
is keep looking at me.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.000
That's it.

48:57.720 --> 48:58.920
Come to me now.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.520
Just keep looking at me.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.870
That's it!

49:05.920 --> 49:07.280
Come to me now.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.590
Nurse Anderson got her
out and into the bedroom.

49:16.640 --> 49:17.870
Took a while, but she did it.

49:17.920 --> 49:20.910
I've taken Michael round
to the neighbours'.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.510
You go to her, Shelagh.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.030
Me being there would
only make matters worse.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.320
I'll be out here with
Mr Dobson, just in case.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.080
Goodbye, Ade.

49:38.240 --> 49:41.830
And be sure to follow all
hospital instructions.

49:41.880 --> 49:44.680
These specialists do know
what they're talking about.

49:46.200 --> 49:47.870
I will pray for you.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.440
And I for you.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.920
For your faith, Sister.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.040
Your prayers have set me
on a firm path to wellness.

50:10.320 --> 50:12.440
May it be the same blessings for you.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.990
Come on, boys. Hurry up with
those chairs! Over to the car.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.710
Look after that trifle like
it's the Crown Jewels, Reggie,

50:33.760 --> 50:37.550
cos Mrs Smith will have my guts for
garters if her bowl gets chipped!

50:37.600 --> 50:40.990
I don't want to put a dampener
on things, Nurse Crane.

50:41.040 --> 50:44.440
Law of averages says you'll get two
vomits and three caught shorts.

50:46.440 --> 50:50.310
Observe these buckets -- one empty,
the other filled with sawdust.

50:50.360 --> 50:53.590
Thus equipped, I am prepared
for most eventualities.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.310
Geoffrey!

50:55.360 --> 50:56.400
Pocket.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.000
Catapult?

51:00.840 --> 51:02.440
Confiscated.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.440
On the bus.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.390
Up you get, Sister. And not
too much singing, do you hear?

51:10.440 --> 51:12.110
We don't want it getting too rowdy.

51:12.160 --> 51:16.190
I may not be able to refrain,
Mr Buckle. It is oft the journey

51:16.240 --> 51:19.670
that provides more delight
than one's destination.

51:19.720 --> 51:22.870
I'm actually quite experienced,
when it comes to childcare.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.480
Mmm. What about when it
comes to changing nappies?

51:26.520 --> 51:29.120
It could be hours before
your mum and dad catch us up!

51:30.400 --> 51:33.310
I'm sure there'll be plenty of
experts willing to advise me!

51:33.360 --> 51:34.270
Ah...

51:35.320 --> 51:37.230
Go on, Alf.

51:37.780 --> 51:39.050
Sit down, Reggie.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.200
♪ Ging, gang, goolie-goolie-goolie... ♪

51:46.840 --> 51:49.270
OK! OK, Eunice.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.510
We're nearly there.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.470
You're doing so well.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.920
She's... She's very close.

51:55.720 --> 51:58.430
Come on, Eunice. You can do it.

51:58.480 --> 52:01.270
I can't do it! Nurse, I told you, I can't!

52:01.320 --> 52:04.110
You can! You can do it, Eunice!

52:04.160 --> 52:06.790
You can breathe this baby out.

52:06.840 --> 52:09.710
Look, look, look, look,
look, follow me! Follow me!

52:11.880 --> 52:13.520
That's it! Good girl.

52:16.280 --> 52:18.000
Nooo Ahhh!

52:24.560 --> 52:28.270
That's it. You're doing beautifully.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.470
That's it, Eunice.

52:30.520 --> 52:31.670
With your next breath,

52:31.720 --> 52:34.390
your baby's going to be
born into this fine new day.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.520
Nearly there, Eunice. Keep going!

52:48.840 --> 52:51.000
You have a beautiful daughter!

52:56.560 --> 52:58.910
You did it!

52:58.960 --> 53:00.430
Thank you!

53:00.480 --> 53:01.840
Thank you!

53:03.040 --> 53:04.800
You did it!

53:21.760 --> 53:23.280
Oh!

53:24.480 --> 53:26.280
Oh!

53:27.800 --> 53:29.440
Oh, my girl!

53:30.960 --> 53:32.680
I'm so proud of you.

53:45.520 --> 53:50.750
Ah. What about that,
then, Vi, eh? We did it!

53:51.300 --> 53:53.400
Yes. We did.

53:56.520 --> 53:59.390
Fred, people are just going in the bushes!

53:59.440 --> 54:02.310
You can't have them
tiddling all over the place.

54:02.360 --> 54:04.950
I mean, this picnic's
got parish connections

54:05.000 --> 54:06.470
and it'll bring out the wasps.

54:06.520 --> 54:10.520
You'll have to go and tell the men
and I'll go and talk to the ladies.

54:18.920 --> 54:21.430
I've put the cases in the hall for now.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.030
Everything smells a bit musty.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.310
I think everyone's gone out.

54:25.360 --> 54:28.710
You said you didn't want any
balloons or a welcoming committee.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.790
That's why we didn't tell
them we were coming home.

54:30.840 --> 54:34.430
I still wanted to see everyone.
Besides, I'm ravenous.

54:34.480 --> 54:35.920
Gangway!

54:37.000 --> 54:39.270
Oh! Hello!

54:39.320 --> 54:40.950
Was that you ringing on the bell?

54:41.000 --> 54:44.590
Sorry. Waters have broken on
the other side of the borough!

54:44.640 --> 54:46.590
Fifth baby.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.360
Where is everyone?

54:49.400 --> 54:51.790
Parish picnic, Epping Forest!

54:51.840 --> 54:53.280
So wonderful you're back.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.590
I don't like it.

54:56.640 --> 55:00.230
I'm afraid I don't care if you
don't like potted beef, Dean.

55:00.280 --> 55:03.190
Once you've bitten into
it, you can't put it back.

55:03.240 --> 55:04.870
And I'm rationing their lemonade

55:04.920 --> 55:07.950
if they can't obey the rules
regarding the facilities.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.590
- Oh, give it to me.
- Come on, Phyllis!

55:09.640 --> 55:12.750
You were a demon at quoits on
board ship, by all accounts.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.190
We can vouch for that!

55:14.240 --> 55:15.280
We certainly can!

55:16.960 --> 55:18.400
Barbara! Tom!

55:24.000 --> 55:25.240
Oh, Teddy!

55:30.640 --> 55:31.520
Ooh!

55:34.160 --> 55:36.870
We picked up a couple of
stragglers on the way.

55:36.920 --> 55:40.360
And we picked up a box of cream cakes.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.310
I'm always rather uneasy when
I see a shop open on a Sunday.

55:45.360 --> 55:48.390
But nobody's going to be clapped
in irons for a few vanilla slices.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.710
I hope not.

55:49.760 --> 55:52.880
We don't want your visit
home ending in a Black Maria.

55:54.960 --> 55:57.070
This isn't a visit, Phyllis.

55:57.120 --> 56:01.110
The Bishop declared my mission
to Birmingham accomplished.

56:01.160 --> 56:04.070
We're back where we belong. For good.

56:06.200 --> 56:07.880
Hurrah!

56:10.760 --> 56:12.790
Eunice had no more children,

56:12.840 --> 56:17.510
and her family, now complete,
became a happy one once more.

56:17.560 --> 56:21.630
Her condition, not recognised
or named for many decades,

56:21.680 --> 56:24.640
is now known as tocophobia.

56:29.040 --> 56:33.350
Fear can keep us tethered,
terror can clip our wings,

56:33.400 --> 56:36.870
but trust eases pain.

56:36.920 --> 56:39.390
Hope can lighten the sky.

56:39.440 --> 56:42.120
Love makes us courageous.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.150
And what matters most is not

56:49.200 --> 56:53.470
whether we hide or fly or even
where our journey takes us --

56:53.520 --> 56:57.320
but what guides us home
and where we come to land.

57:10.640 --> 57:13.470
I mean, it's just like
the photo! It's perfect.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.590
I'm in to get me cataract done.

57:15.640 --> 57:19.190
Ripe as a French fig
and ready for slicing!

57:19.240 --> 57:21.750
I could lose my children. I have no home.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.430
I have no means of making a living.

57:23.480 --> 57:26.470
Am I to stand by while you
corrupt their young minds?

57:26.520 --> 57:27.910
Phyllis!

57:27.960 --> 57:30.600
My friend -- she's inside. Please help!
