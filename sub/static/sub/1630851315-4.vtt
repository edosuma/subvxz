20:36.017 --> 20:37.932
Hey, there's
no trick. Just...

20:37.975 --> 20:40.935
too much practice
in life-threatening situations.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.981
After a few tours, you get good
at compartmentalizing.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.592
And the man you shot?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.289
Don't have
a lot of sympathy

20:47.333 --> 20:49.639
for drug dealers
who try to kill my f...

20:50.597 --> 20:52.207
...colleagues.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.689
You almost said "friend."

20:57.604 --> 20:59.519
I almost took
a knife for you.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.434
Actions speak louder
than words.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.914
Yeah.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.314
Hey.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.143
I don't like what I had to do.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.319
And I don't want
to make a habit of it.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.668
But, right now,
I'm just...

21:18.712 --> 21:20.931
I'm cruising on adrenaline.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.194
And tonight I will crash.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.154
[footsteps approaching]

21:26.197 --> 21:27.416
All right, for what it's worth,

21:27.460 --> 21:29.636
the suspect you took down
was a real scumbag.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.551
Name's Jon Mendoza.

21:31.594 --> 21:34.467
Just released from Halawa for an
assault that left a guy blind.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.990
And that's
the cherry on top

21:36.033 --> 21:37.383
of a lifetime of felonies.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.993
What about
gang affiliations?

21:39.036 --> 21:41.865
Uh, his ink connects him
to at least four.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.476
He plays the field.

21:43.519 --> 21:46.653
So we're no closer to ID'ing
the group slinging the meth?

21:46.696 --> 21:49.133
ERNIE:Well, we're a little closer.
I managed to pinpoint

21:49.177 --> 21:50.396
the chemical makeup
of the drugs.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.788
So...

21:51.832 --> 21:53.660
now I guess I'm...
[exhales]

21:53.703 --> 21:56.315
[gasps]
If-if you're on your way to HPD,

21:56.358 --> 21:57.707
I'm coming.No, no, no.

21:57.751 --> 21:58.795
You're not invited.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.014
A] I'm useful.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.059
And B] don't you want a wingman

22:02.103 --> 22:03.887
for when you see
Detective Reed again?

22:03.931 --> 22:05.628
[exhales]
Fine.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.026
[indistinct chatter]

22:12.069 --> 22:13.767
Ernie Malik?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.510
Dalia.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.381
[chuckles][grunts]

22:23.472 --> 22:25.605
You look good.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.215
Still lifting?

22:27.258 --> 22:28.651
No.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.261
He's being modest, isn't he?

22:30.305 --> 22:31.959
He's definitely working out.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.135
"Modest" isn't a word
that comes to mind.

22:34.178 --> 22:37.225
Uh, can we, uh,
find a meth gang?

22:43.579 --> 22:44.972
[scoffs]

22:46.539 --> 22:48.758
You always have the best toys.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.586
Did you get a look at
the, uh, chemical makeup

22:50.630 --> 22:53.197
of the meth I sent, the one with
the irregular isomeric SMILES?

22:53.241 --> 22:54.721
Uh, what are

22:54.764 --> 22:56.810
isomeric SMILES?Stands for

22:56.853 --> 22:59.943
"simplified molecular-input
line-entry system."

22:59.987 --> 23:01.945
Oh, that old chestnut.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.339
It's basically the building
blocks of a molecule.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.819
Depending on how
the meth was cooked,

23:05.862 --> 23:07.864
sometimes they have unique
compounds we can pinpoint

23:07.908 --> 23:09.126
and therefore trace.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.954
You learn this on the job?

23:10.998 --> 23:12.260
She has a master's
in chemistry from UH.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.131
It's why she's
on the task force.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.569
Ernie and I like
getting weird with compounds.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.005
[quietly]:
Ew.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.573
I just appreciate
the sciences.

23:20.616 --> 23:23.184
And the smiling thing?Turns out

23:23.227 --> 23:26.927
both the isomeric SMILES and the
deprecated CAS have identifiers.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.929
Whoever was cooking for them
clearly thinks

23:28.972 --> 23:30.234
they're Walter White.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.411
That's a reference
to a popular TV show.

23:32.454 --> 23:35.501
Oh, yes,
I know what Breaking Badis.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.285
ERNIE:I'm linking to
your database.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.461
Pinpointing everywhere this,
uh, particular strain of meth

23:39.505 --> 23:40.854
has been seized.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.290
Hopefully we can
find a pattern.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.423
That's the problem.
This stuff is everywhere.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.163
It's not a problem,Dalia.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.774
Opportunity gap.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.298
I created a reverse
"stone still pond" algorithm

23:50.341 --> 23:51.908
to help narrow it down.

23:51.952 --> 23:54.911
So your, uh... your fancy
skipping stone whatsit

23:54.955 --> 23:58.045
identifies all the meth
with that chemical makeup

23:58.088 --> 23:59.786
and where it might
be coming from?

23:59.829 --> 24:01.875
I describe it right?Sure.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.877
In the same way that someone
might describe the Taj Mahal

24:03.920 --> 24:06.096
as a pile of
marble and jade.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.406
It's gonna take a beat.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.365
That's okay.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.237
I'm into it.

24:21.285 --> 24:24.071
Hoku, we need to know where
Kaleo and Micah are hiding.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.029
Why? So you can
arrest them?

24:26.073 --> 24:27.944
Nobody's been arrested.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.380
Not yet, at least.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.034
TENNANT:
Look, we don't think you

24:31.078 --> 24:33.167
or any of the other paniolos
are involved in this.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.343
Micah, on the other hand,
has some explaining to do.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.345
Micah isn't a criminal.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.520
And I want to go now.

24:38.564 --> 24:39.913
Hoku, please.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.393
A man broke into my house,
almost killed me.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.613
They're looking for
Micah and Kaleo now.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.049
You need to tell them.

24:55.406 --> 24:56.756
What do you need to know?

24:56.799 --> 24:58.627
For starters,

24:58.671 --> 25:00.499
you can help

25:00.542 --> 25:02.631
fill in some of the gaps.

25:03.589 --> 25:07.201
Micah got in with the wrong
group of friends at school.

25:07.244 --> 25:10.378
I guess one of them
was earning quick kala,

25:10.421 --> 25:11.684
easy cash.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.250
Told Micah he
could do the same.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.904
Quick cash doing what?

25:14.948 --> 25:17.211
Running packages up and down
the mountain on horseback.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.954
Micah's a good kid.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.477
He just wanted to
contribute to the ranch.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.174
Did Micah know
what he was running?

25:26.394 --> 25:28.309
On his second trip,

25:28.352 --> 25:30.529
Micah opened the package.

25:30.572 --> 25:33.183
The moment he saw the
meth, he wanted out.

25:33.227 --> 25:34.924
It's not the paniolo way,

25:34.968 --> 25:36.796
no matter
how much money is involved.

25:36.839 --> 25:39.581
Except this isn't your "put
your two weeks in" kind of gig.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.367
Micah went to his dad for help.

25:43.411 --> 25:44.978
Kaleo hid him,

25:45.021 --> 25:46.936
then went to talk to the gang.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.156
Why didn't he go to the police
to sort this out?

25:50.157 --> 25:52.463
He didn't want Micah
to get in trouble.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.770
Figured he'd negotiate
with these people,

25:54.814 --> 25:56.555
keep the boy out of the system.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.122
[inhales, exhales]

25:59.166 --> 26:00.384
I'm so sorry.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.473
So he hid Micah
in the mountains?

26:03.387 --> 26:05.433
Wanted to get to him
before the gang did.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.304
Okay.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.437
Where in the mountains are they?

26:11.352 --> 26:12.309
I can't tell you.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.615
Listen, man,

26:13.659 --> 26:15.138
we're running out of time.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.618
I can't tell you.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.056
But I can show you.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.021
Okay, whoa, whoa.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.287
Need help getting
on your mount?

26:33.330 --> 26:35.637
No, I'm cool.
[grunts]

26:35.681 --> 26:37.770
[grunts]

26:37.813 --> 26:39.249
[horse snorting]

26:39.293 --> 26:40.990
Don't look cool.[grunts]

26:41.034 --> 26:42.252
Totally cool.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.257
Go on.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.050
[horse sputters]

26:57.093 --> 26:59.487
Let's ride.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.365
Add this to the list of things
I didn't know about you.

27:08.409 --> 27:09.845
Where'd you learn to ride?

27:09.889 --> 27:11.281
TENNANT:
Tama Hills.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.762
JESSE:
Tama Hills. Is that Wyoming?

27:13.806 --> 27:15.242
TENNANT:
Japan.

27:15.285 --> 27:16.983
My dad was stationed there
when I was 12.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.158
And while the other kids
in my school

27:18.201 --> 27:19.725
were going to game centers,

27:19.768 --> 27:21.378
I went to the stables.

27:21.422 --> 27:25.165
I had a, uh, wooden rocking
horse named Max in Aberdeen.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.688
So, same thing.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.429
[horse sputters]

27:28.472 --> 27:30.474
But the real thing
really hurts your ass.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.215
Almost there.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.522
You think you're in
pain, Whitman did this

27:34.565 --> 27:36.655
with 27 sutures
in his abdomen.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.526
The things we'll do
for our kids.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.876
The things we won't do
for our kids.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.442
There's got to be

27:41.485 --> 27:42.704
a line, right?

27:42.748 --> 27:44.488
Course there's a line.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.839
Whitman is trying to do
right by his boy, but...

27:46.882 --> 27:49.624
desperate parents don't
always make good decisions.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.022
DALIA:
Must be hard,

27:56.065 --> 27:58.764
working with him every day.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.550
[loud slurping]

28:03.638 --> 28:05.422
He has his quirks.

28:05.466 --> 28:08.164
I wouldn't be able to
concentrate on anything else.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.732
[coughs]LUCY:
Oh, I-I didn't mean it like...

28:10.776 --> 28:13.561
He's like a stealth bomber.
[scoffs]

28:13.604 --> 28:15.563
You don't even know
what hit you.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.521
ERNIE:
I got something.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.088
My algorithm pinpointed

28:19.132 --> 28:20.742
six key
distribution hubs

28:20.786 --> 28:24.615
for our strain of meth.
They're in there.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.182
DALIA:Those are public
high schools.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.967
Which makes sense.
Whitman's son was approached

28:28.010 --> 28:30.883
by a friend of his at school
to run drugs for them.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.320
So the gang uses teenagers
to push their products.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.670
Kids get caught,
then can't do hard time.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.845
It's pretty clever.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.151
And also awful.

28:38.194 --> 28:39.848
What's that... place over there?

28:39.892 --> 28:41.763
Doesn't look
like a school.Warehouse

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
in Waikele. That must be
where they're manufacturing

28:43.809 --> 28:44.766
their meth![sighs]

28:44.810 --> 28:46.115
Way to steal my moment,
Dalia.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.204
He always takes too long
on the windup.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.206
Don't remember hearing
a lot of complaints.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.774
Anywho, the warehouse.Yes.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.037
Owned by a man
named Sam Jennings.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.039
Crazy Sam? He
used to run a group

28:57.083 --> 28:59.128
called the Kolohe Krew.
Small-time.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.783
Yeah, they upped their profile.
Threw in with a cartel.

29:01.827 --> 29:04.003
Linked to numerous
gang murders.

29:04.046 --> 29:06.135
We've been looking for
their distro hub for two years.

29:06.179 --> 29:07.833
Thanks to me, you got him.

29:07.876 --> 29:08.834
[chuckles]

29:08.877 --> 29:11.184
You want
to seal the deal?

29:11.227 --> 29:15.623
I'd love to see you kick in
a door in those sandals.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.974
Why don't I leave you
both to finish up.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.672
I'm gonna go round up the others
so we can crash that warehouse

29:21.716 --> 29:24.588
and take these guys down.

29:30.943 --> 29:33.075
I was... thinking...

29:33.119 --> 29:34.468
No.[zipping]

29:34.511 --> 29:36.905
You didn't even let me finish.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.823
You were thinking
maybe we grab lunch or drinks.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.086
Just friends, no strings.
Am I close?

29:46.219 --> 29:48.482
You know how this ends.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.399
I do.
[exhales]

29:53.356 --> 29:54.793
[exhales]

29:58.274 --> 29:59.972
Coffee.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.539
Midafternoon. I pick
the location and we go dutch.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.069
Great.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.723
We're close.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.207
There's blood here.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.209
TENNANT:
Ho.

30:29.784 --> 30:32.482
And old dressing, too.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.797
Hey, Kaleo!Hey, shh!

30:42.841 --> 30:43.842
Hands where I can see them!

30:45.104 --> 30:46.496
[quietly]:
Jesse.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.584
Do it!

30:47.628 --> 30:48.759
Micah,

30:48.803 --> 30:50.413
put the gun down.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.632
They're with me.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.026
We're law enforcement.
NCIS.

30:54.069 --> 30:55.505
