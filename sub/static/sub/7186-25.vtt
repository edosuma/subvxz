01:07.634 --> 01:08.667
Great!

01:08.669 --> 01:10.335
To start today's adventure,

01:10.337 --> 01:13.072
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.773
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.775 --> 01:16.775
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.777 --> 01:18.310
One more time.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.379
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.783 --> 01:26.518
[Jake] Jake and Sneaky Le Beak!

01:26.520 --> 01:28.754
[Hook] Hoist the canvas, lads!

01:28.756 --> 01:32.491
We're settin' sail
for Rainbow Falls!

01:32.493 --> 01:36.428
[laughs] Sounds like we
be goin' a-treasure huntin'!

01:36.430 --> 01:40.299
Aye! Rumor has it,
there's a secret grotto

01:40.301 --> 01:45.304
where we will find the rare,
rainbow-striped Splendor Gem!

01:45.306 --> 01:48.240
- [screeches]
- What in blazes?!

01:49.343 --> 01:54.646
Why, that's
the funniest-lookin' seagull
I ever did see.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.316
That's no seagull,
that's a falcon,

01:57.318 --> 02:01.120
and he belongs to...
[gasps] Beatrice Le Beak,

02:01.122 --> 02:05.324
the sneakiest, thievin' pirate
to ever sail the Never Sea!

02:05.326 --> 02:06.758
Pishposh, Smee!

02:06.760 --> 02:10.829
There is no pirate sneakier
than Captain Hook.

02:10.831 --> 02:15.701
[French accent]
Oh, bonjour! My ship,
she was lost in a storm.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.403
Do you think you could
lend me a... Hook!

02:18.405 --> 02:21.673
Croissant! You are Captain Hook.

02:21.675 --> 02:26.812
- I've heard so much about you.
- And I... [chuckles] you.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.181
Permission to board.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.583
Oh, captain, are you sure?

02:31.585 --> 02:32.818
This could be a trick.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.154
Remember, Le Beak
is said to be sneaky...

02:35.156 --> 02:39.391
- ...and thieving, too!
- Ah, <i>Capitaine</i> Hook...

02:39.393 --> 02:42.694
I could not help
but overhear all this talk

02:42.696 --> 02:44.630
about the
Rainbow Falls and,

02:44.632 --> 02:47.566
how you say,
Splendor Gem?

02:47.568 --> 02:50.836
[gasps] You stay away
from me treasure!

02:50.838 --> 02:54.373
Oh! But I am Beatrice Le Beak,

02:54.375 --> 02:57.743
- I can take whatever I want.
- Oh, my!

02:58.444 --> 02:59.745
Barnacles!

02:59.747 --> 03:01.813
What in plunder
just happened?

03:01.815 --> 03:05.217
Why you have
just been Le Beaked!

03:05.219 --> 03:09.788
The Splendor Gem,
she awaits! Au revoir!

03:09.790 --> 03:13.358
Oh, could this day
get any worse?!

03:13.360 --> 03:16.495
- [Jake] Ahoy, Captain Hook!
- Blast.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.298
[Izzy] Say, where's
the    <i>Jolly Rog</i>going?

03:19.300 --> 03:22.768
It's been stolen by a
thieving pirate sneak,

03:22.770 --> 03:26.238
Beatrice Le Beak!

03:26.240 --> 03:30.209
<i>¶ There's no bigger sneak</i>
<i>than Beatrice Le Beak ¶</i>

03:30.211 --> 03:34.446
<i>¶ If she wants your treasure</i>
<i>it's gone in a wink ¶</i>

03:34.448 --> 03:36.248
<i>¶ She'll creep</i>
<i>and she'll slink ¶</i>

<i>¶ And before you can blink </i>

03:37.918 --> 03:40.252
<i>¶ You have just been</i>
<i>Le Beaked ¶</i>

03:40.254 --> 03:43.922
<i>¶ By the sneakiest</i>
<i>of sneaky sneaks ¶</i>

03:44.624 --> 03:45.591
<i>¶ En guard! </i>

03:45.593 --> 03:47.893
<i>¶ Le sneaky Le Beak! </i>

03:47.895 --> 03:49.728
See, Captain Hook?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.931
It isn't very nice when
someone else takes your things.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.702
But maybe we can help you
get the <i>Jolly Roger</i> back.

03:56.704 --> 04:00.505
Captain Hook does not
need help from puny...

04:00.507 --> 04:04.977
Eh, all right,
just this once.

04:04.979 --> 04:07.846
Mateys, let's help
Captain Hook and his crew

04:07.848 --> 04:10.749
get the <i>Jolly Roger</i> back
from sneaky Le Beak!

04:10.751 --> 04:12.884
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.953
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,

04:14.955 --> 04:16.455
they'll appear.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.556
Then we'll collect 'em,

04:17.558 --> 04:19.691
and put 'em
in our Team Treasure Chest.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.693
Yo-ho, let's go!

04:21.695 --> 04:23.662
Is everybody ready?

04:23.664 --> 04:25.497
I got my sword!

04:25.499 --> 04:26.865
I got my map!

04:26.867 --> 04:29.268
And I've got my pixie dust!

04:29.270 --> 04:32.871
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.940
But only in emergencies.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.777
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

04:38.779 --> 04:41.880
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

04:41.882 --> 04:46.351
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:46.353 --> 04:49.354
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:49.356 --> 04:51.423
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:55.361 --> 04:56.595
[screeches]

04:57.330 --> 04:59.031
Ahoy, Madame pirate Le Beak!

04:59.033 --> 05:03.035
Go away, itsy-bitsy buccaneers.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.737
I am busy with
the hunting of the treasure.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.972
Maybe...

05:06.974 --> 05:09.641
...but could you please
give back the things

05:09.643 --> 05:11.710
you took
from Captain Hook and his crew?

05:11.712 --> 05:14.446
Give back what I took?

05:14.448 --> 05:18.383
[laughs] Oh, I see,

05:18.385 --> 05:20.085
this is one
of your little,

05:20.087 --> 05:23.922
how-you-say,
petite pirate jokes, eh?

05:23.924 --> 05:26.591
Time to escargot!

05:26.593 --> 05:31.863
We can't let her get away.
Bucky, full speed ahead!

05:33.633 --> 05:37.102
Fastclaw, bid
the petite pirates adieu,

05:37.104 --> 05:39.671
and stop them
from following me!

05:39.673 --> 05:41.406
[screeching]

05:43.776 --> 05:45.444
[all] Whoa!

05:45.446 --> 05:46.845
- [all grunt]
- Blast!

05:46.847 --> 05:50.015
Au revoir,
you silly little peoples!

05:50.017 --> 05:54.586
Bucky can't pull up the anchor.
It's stuck in those rocks!

05:54.588 --> 05:57.823
Maybe I can pry
the anchor loose with my sword!

05:57.825 --> 06:01.993
[grunts] Pull, Bucky! Pull!

06:02.862 --> 06:03.895
Yey-hey.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.764
We got the anchor unstuck,

06:05.766 --> 06:07.999
and we got three gold doubloons.

06:08.001 --> 06:11.770
Let's grab 'em
and go after Le Beak!

06:15.408 --> 06:17.943
Oh, me beloved <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

06:17.945 --> 06:21.813
So close and yet so far.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.849
But where is
Beatrice Le Beak?

06:24.917 --> 06:27.819
That sneak is
headed for Rainbow Falls,

06:27.821 --> 06:30.889
and that's where
the treasure is!

06:30.891 --> 06:34.760
- Great! How lucky can you get?
- Lucky?!

06:34.762 --> 06:38.497
That scoundrel is looking
to swipe me Splendor Gem!

06:38.499 --> 06:43.835
While she's busy rock climbing,
you can get your ship back easy!

06:45.171 --> 06:46.872
[Hook] Ahoy, Le Beak.

06:46.874 --> 06:50.976
I'm takin' me ship back.
[chortles]

06:50.978 --> 06:52.744
[chuckles]

06:52.746 --> 06:57.816
Now this is something I'd
very much like to see, <i>oui, oui.</i>

06:57.818 --> 07:00.185
You can't stop me now...

07:00.187 --> 07:02.421
- [screeching]
- [yelps]

07:04.524 --> 07:08.059
- [laughs]
- [screeches]

07:08.061 --> 07:10.162
Shiver me timbers!

07:10.164 --> 07:12.964
How's Hook ever going
to get past Le Beak's falcon?

07:12.966 --> 07:15.867
Crackers.
I've got an idea!

07:15.869 --> 07:19.104
Maybe we can keep that
feathered fiend busy with...

07:19.106 --> 07:21.573
...crackers! [chortles]

07:23.643 --> 07:24.843
Aw, feathers!

07:24.845 --> 07:27.446
I dropped me delicious crackers!

07:27.448 --> 07:28.713
[screeches]

07:28.715 --> 07:31.216
I hope no one
tries to steal them.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.751
[screeches]

07:32.753 --> 07:36.455
No, no!
Don't do it, you silly bird.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.758
It is le petite pirate trickery!

07:39.760 --> 07:42.494
[gulping]

07:43.496 --> 07:46.465
- [moans]
- Sorry, Le Beak,

07:46.467 --> 07:50.902
but the <i>Jolly Roger</i> is,
once again, mine!

07:50.904 --> 07:52.771
Crackers! Yeah!

07:52.773 --> 07:56.475
We helped Hook and his crew
get the <i>Jolly Roger</i> back,

07:56.477 --> 07:59.578
and we got
three more gold doubloons!

07:59.580 --> 08:01.112
Let's grab 'em and go.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.816
Who cares about
your floaty little boat?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.518
I'll just get another

08:06.520 --> 08:10.622
after I get
the Splendor Gem treasure!

08:10.624 --> 08:14.526
- [chuckles]
- [groans] But...

08:14.528 --> 08:16.895
The Splendor Gem!

08:16.897 --> 08:19.164
Oh, but, captain,
the important thing

08:19.166 --> 08:21.700
is that you got
the <i>Jolly Roger</i> back.

08:21.702 --> 08:25.237
Aye, and now Mr. Smee
can cook in his galley again!

08:25.239 --> 08:29.140
And we got our strummy
and squeezy things, too!

08:29.142 --> 08:32.511
I suppose there will be
other treasures.

08:33.713 --> 08:35.247
But I want this one!

08:35.882 --> 08:37.782
Oh, dear.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.786
The captain
can be so stubborn.

08:41.788 --> 08:42.954
[all] Huh?

08:42.956 --> 08:47.926
The Splendor Gem,
she is mine. She is mine!

08:47.928 --> 08:51.296
[gasps] Rotten Roquefort!
It cannot be.

08:51.298 --> 08:56.201
[snickers] Sorry, Le Beak,
you've just been Le Hooked!

08:56.203 --> 08:57.736
[chuckles] What?!

08:57.738 --> 09:01.006
- [shouts indistinctly]
- Le ha!

09:01.008 --> 09:06.144
- Nothing can stop me now!
- Nothing except me.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.047
Away you pesky, petite pirates.

09:09.049 --> 09:13.919
- Au revoir, Captain Hook.
- Blast! Come back here.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.820
Captain Hook!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.089
Are you OK?

09:18.091 --> 09:22.060
Oh, I will be
once I get me treasure.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.197
- Unhand me treasure!
- No, it's mine.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.999
- Mine, mine, mine!
- Mine! Mine!

09:28.001 --> 09:30.068
Captain Hook! Madame Le Beak!

09:30.070 --> 09:32.871
Can't you two
just share the gem?

09:32.873 --> 09:35.874
[both] Share? Never!

09:35.876 --> 09:38.109
[both grunting]

09:38.111 --> 09:39.744
[both screaming]

09:39.746 --> 09:43.915
This is an emergency.
Pixie dust away!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.017
[both continue screaming]

09:46.019 --> 09:48.853
- [shouts]
- The Splendor Gem!

09:48.855 --> 09:50.188
Yey-hey.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.958
We saved Captain Hook
and Beatrice Le Beak,

09:52.960 --> 09:55.994
and we got
four more gold doubloons!

09:55.996 --> 09:58.296
Let's grab 'em and go!

10:01.701 --> 10:05.003
No fair.
I wanted that treasure.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.205
Well, you can't
have it all, Captain Hook.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.240
Goodbye, popinjays.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.711
We just can't thank you
enough for all your help!

10:12.713 --> 10:16.081
[clears throat]
Isn't that right, Captain?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.149
Oh, ah...

10:18.151 --> 10:21.152
I think what Mr. Smee
is trying to say is,

10:21.154 --> 10:24.756
I shall excuse
your meddling this time.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.792
[laughs] Whatever you say,
Captain Hook.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.328
See you later,
Captain Hook.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.631
And as for you, Le Beak,

10:32.633 --> 10:36.735
I hope you learned
that sneaky pirates never win!

10:36.737 --> 10:38.970
Aw, le phooey!

10:41.374 --> 10:44.042
Thanks for helping get
the <i>Jolly Roger</i> back, mateys!

10:44.044 --> 10:46.277
Now let's put
all our gold doubloons

10:46.279 --> 10:48.647
into our Team Treasure Chest.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.956
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

10:57.958 --> 10:59.991
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

10:59.993 --> 11:02.060
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:02.062 --> 11:04.963
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:04.965 --> 11:07.666
Come on. Count with us.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.068
[all] Yeah!

11:10.070 --> 11:13.905
[Jake] One, two, three...

11:13.907 --> 11:15.240
[Cubby] Four, five...

11:15.242 --> 11:19.277
[Izzy] Six, seven,
eight, nine, ten!

11:19.279 --> 11:22.347
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:22.349 --> 11:24.949
we got ten gold doubloons.

11:25.786 --> 11:30.188
Whoa! Sounds like someone
has a hungry tummy.

11:30.190 --> 11:34.359
Aye! But thanks to Fastclaw,
I'm all out of crackers.

11:34.361 --> 11:39.831
I'm not. Say hello and bonjour
to a special French treat...

11:39.833 --> 11:42.467
Voila! Crackers souffle.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.803
[fake French accent]
Looks le yummy!

11:44.805 --> 11:47.338
[both laughing]

11:48.841 --> 11:50.742
Beatrice Le Beak...

11:50.744 --> 11:52.944
As captain
of the <i>Jolly Roger,</i>

11:52.946 --> 11:56.848
I hereby order you
to walk the plank.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.851
[sighs] <i>Oui, oui.</i>

12:02.722 --> 12:06.191
Or maybe no <i>oui, oui.</i>
<i>Le ha ha!</i>

12:06.193 --> 12:08.793
That's me Whirly-Hook!

12:08.795 --> 12:12.097
Le Beak, you sneak!

12:15.167 --> 12:16.835
<i>[Jake]</i> Cubby the Brave!

12:16.837 --> 12:18.870
[Izzy] Check it out, mateys.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.172
This old slide
looks like fun.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.007
I'll go first.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.944
Yey-hey!

12:27.346 --> 12:30.215
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

12:30.217 --> 12:32.884
What a blast.
Me next!

12:32.886 --> 12:34.419
Then it's your turn, Cubby.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.756
Um, I don't know.
It looks kind of high.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.892
Yo-ho!

12:40.894 --> 12:43.828
Ah, coconuts.
This is high.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.865
[screaming]

12:46.867 --> 12:48.199
Whoa!

12:48.901 --> 12:50.135
I did it!

12:50.137 --> 12:54.072
[stuttering] Mateys?
Look at this!

12:54.074 --> 12:55.340
- Wow!
- Crackers!

12:55.342 --> 12:56.875
It's Claw Rock!

12:56.877 --> 12:58.810
I've heard that there's
supposed to be a map

12:58.812 --> 13:00.145
carved on it
that leads

13:00.147 --> 13:02.347
to the treasure
of Spiky-Pike Peak!

13:02.349 --> 13:05.817
Why couldn't it be
the treasure of Happy Beach?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.820
Mateys, there is a map up here!

13:08.822 --> 13:10.421
Cool!
But there's no way

13:10.423 --> 13:12.357
we can carry this rock
around like a map

13:12.359 --> 13:13.992
while we look
for the treasure.

13:13.994 --> 13:17.262
Well, we could make
a rubbing on the back of my map,

13:17.264 --> 13:19.030
and take it with us!

13:21.534 --> 13:23.501
[Izzy] Good thinking, Cubby.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.904
Now we can
take the map with us,

13:25.906 --> 13:28.940
and find the treasure
of Spiky-Pike Peak.

13:28.942 --> 13:33.011
First we have to pass through...
[shudders] Frightening Forest!

13:33.013 --> 13:34.212
Don't worry, Cubby,

13:34.214 --> 13:36.581
we'll be with you
every step of the way.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.550
Mateys, will you go with us

13:38.552 --> 13:41.986
to hunt for the treasure
of Spiky-Pike Peak?

13:43.222 --> 13:46.591
Great! Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.459
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,

13:48.461 --> 13:49.894
they'll appear.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.964
and put 'em
in our Team Treasure Chest.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.900
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

13:55.902 --> 13:58.303
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:58.305 --> 13:59.871
Let's go!

13:59.873 --> 14:03.174
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:03.176 --> 14:06.211
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:06.213 --> 14:08.213
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:10.850 --> 14:13.451
Uh, why don't
you guys lead the way?

14:13.453 --> 14:16.020
Frightening Forest
is just up ahead.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.388
Can't miss it!

14:17.390 --> 14:20.425
I wish there was some way
we could help Cubby realize

14:20.427 --> 14:22.393
just how brave
he really is.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.896
Yo-ho, mateys!
Boots ahoy!

14:24.898 --> 14:26.965
Huh. That's weird.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.601
A pair of old pirate boots
just sitting here.

14:29.603 --> 14:32.036
I wonder who they belong to?

14:33.205 --> 14:36.541
Hmm. Looks like they were
left and forgotten long ago.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.142
You know what, crew?

14:38.144 --> 14:41.913
These could be
the famous Boots of Bravery!

14:41.915 --> 14:47.385
Special boots that make anyone
who wears 'em extra brave!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.254
You really think these are them?

14:49.256 --> 14:51.656
I'm not sure, Cubby,
but they could be.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.992
Try 'em on and find out.

14:53.994 --> 14:58.096
Jake, there's no such thing
as Boots of Bravery, is there?

14:58.098 --> 15:00.231
I don't know.
But if wearing those boots

15:00.233 --> 15:01.900
will help Cubby
feel brave,

15:01.902 --> 15:04.068
then they will be
Boots of Bravery to him!

15:04.070 --> 15:07.205
Check it out, mateys!
They're a little big,

15:07.207 --> 15:10.675
but I think I feel
braver already.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.277
[both] Awesome!

15:12.279 --> 15:17.015
Onward, mateys,
to Not-So-Frightening Forest!

15:17.017 --> 15:21.452
Wow! I think the Boots
of Bravery are working, Jake!

15:21.454 --> 15:25.123
- [Jake] Just like I was hoping!
- [owl hooting]

15:25.125 --> 15:30.395
This underwater treasure hunt
was a colossal waste of time.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.997
There is nothing
in this lake!

15:32.999 --> 15:36.501
[chuckles] I wouldn't
say nothing, Captain.

15:38.170 --> 15:41.005
Insolent fishy. Be gone!

15:41.007 --> 15:43.975
Come, Smee!
Time to return
to the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

15:43.977 --> 15:49.180
- [gasps] Me boots are gone!
- Oh, now, Captain, sir,

15:49.182 --> 15:51.649
they couldn't have walked off
all by themselves.

15:51.651 --> 15:55.086
Look, Smee, boot prints.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.056
Me boots went this-a-way.

15:59.625 --> 16:04.028
I totally get why they call this
the Frightening Forest.

16:04.030 --> 16:08.299
- [hooting noises]
- Who or what was that?

16:08.301 --> 16:11.669
Skully, it's nothin'
to fear. Look!

16:11.671 --> 16:14.505
It's just an owl.
Hiya, boy.

16:14.507 --> 16:19.344
- [hoots]
- It's me, Cubby the Brave.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.713
[chuckles] Yo-ho, Cubby,

16:21.715 --> 16:23.715
those boots are
really workin' for ya!

16:23.717 --> 16:25.583
Yep, I guess so!

16:25.585 --> 16:29.120
This way, mateys,
to Cobweb Cave!

16:30.689 --> 16:33.691
Cobweb Cave.
[chuckles] Good name.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.595
[Skully] And it's crawling
with creepy-crawlies!

16:37.597 --> 16:39.998
Aw, they're not so scary.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.700
But we need to light
our way through here.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.670
Hmm. Pixie dust glows.

16:45.672 --> 16:50.541
So, Izzy, could we use
a little emergency pinch of it?

16:50.543 --> 16:55.380
You got it.
Pixie dust away!

16:56.582 --> 17:01.252
- [chittering]
- Yo-ho, in we go.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.722
[spiders continue chittering]

17:04.724 --> 17:07.058
Are we out yet, Smee?

17:07.060 --> 17:09.694
Are we out
of that dreadful forest?

17:09.696 --> 17:12.063
You weren't afraid
in there, were you?

17:12.065 --> 17:17.235
No... Me? Afraid?
Don't be preposterous!

17:17.237 --> 17:19.370
Good. Because the boot prints

17:19.372 --> 17:22.607
head right into that...
[gulps] dark cave.

17:22.609 --> 17:26.077
[chittering continues]

17:26.079 --> 17:29.347
Yey-hey! We lit the way
through Cobweb Cave,

17:29.349 --> 17:31.749
and we got three gold doubloons.

17:31.751 --> 17:36.187
Let's grab 'em and go find
the treasure of Spiky-Pike Peak.

17:41.660 --> 17:45.496
[Hook] Ouch! Smee,
stop stepping on me feet.

17:45.498 --> 17:48.199
Sorry, Captain,
I can't see a thing.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.735
And take your hand
off me shoulder.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.738
But... sir... my hand
isn't on your shoulder.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.606
- Your hand isn't...
- [spider chortles]

17:55.608 --> 17:58.643
- [screams]
- Oh, dear.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.611
Get off, get off!

18:01.815 --> 18:06.717
What a pirate must go through
to get his boots back.

18:06.719 --> 18:11.622
It's not over yet, sir.
The boot prints head up there.

18:12.724 --> 18:15.193
[gasps] We're nearing
the top, Smee.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.829
We've got
that boot burglar cornered.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.197
Ow!

18:19.199 --> 18:21.399
Oh, Captain,
did you stub your...

18:21.401 --> 18:22.834
[both shout]

18:22.836 --> 18:25.403
Help!

18:25.405 --> 18:27.705
[Hook] Help me, someone.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.809
Shiver me timbers!
That sounds like Captain Hook!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.744
Hook and Mr. Smee
are in trouble.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.714
- Dangerous trouble!
- We gotta save 'em!

18:36.716 --> 18:40.151
I bet that bundle of vines
can hold their weight.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.320
If only we could get it to them.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.388
I'll get the vines to them.

18:44.390 --> 18:48.259
Thanks to the Boots of Bravery,
I'm all good!

18:55.634 --> 18:56.901
Ahoy, Captain Hook.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.771
Popinjay!
Save me, I beg of you!

19:00.773 --> 19:04.542
No problem.
Going up!

19:06.145 --> 19:07.845
Way to go, Cubby.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.281
You saved Captain Hook
and Mr. Smee.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.417
And I got
three more gold doubloons.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.419
Let's grab 'em and go!

19:16.288 --> 19:17.788
I must say, lad,

19:17.790 --> 19:21.792
you are
the bravest pirate in... [gasps]

19:21.794 --> 19:23.794
Me boots!

19:23.796 --> 19:27.932
You're the boot-thievin' swab
I've been looking for!

19:27.934 --> 19:29.300
[all] What?!

19:29.302 --> 19:30.902
It's true, sea pups.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.604
The captain left
those boots down by the lake

19:33.606 --> 19:34.906
while we went for a swim.

19:34.908 --> 19:36.841
Sorry, Captain Hook.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.710
I wouldn't have taken 'em
if I knew they were yours.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.446
We thought they were
the Boots of Bravery!

19:42.448 --> 19:46.651
My footwear
Boots of Bravery?

19:46.653 --> 19:48.953
[laughs] That's a good one!

19:48.955 --> 19:51.756
But if those aren't
the Boots of Bravery,

19:51.758 --> 19:55.226
then that means I did
all that brave stuff

19:55.228 --> 19:58.963
with no special help!
All by myself!

19:58.965 --> 20:02.233
See, Cubby. We knew you
had a brave pirate heart.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.701
You just had to let it out.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.305
And thanks to
Captain Hook's boots, you did.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.308
Wow. That's awesome!

20:10.310 --> 20:11.809
Speakin' of awesome,

20:11.811 --> 20:15.479
we're almost to
the treasure of Spiky-Pike Peak!

20:15.481 --> 20:17.682
That's right,
the treasure!

20:17.684 --> 20:19.850
Mateys, follow me.

20:19.852 --> 20:23.588
Treasure, eh?
[chuckles]

20:23.590 --> 20:24.956
Step lively, Smee!

20:26.258 --> 20:27.992
It's another Claw Rock!

20:27.994 --> 20:30.828
With some words
carved into it.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.232
"Here be the treasure
of Spiky-Pike Peak.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.902
To all who dare,
it has the thrills you seek."

20:37.904 --> 20:39.937
What treasure?

20:39.939 --> 20:42.807
It's just pointing
to the edge of a cliff.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.710
It's not a cliff. It's a slide.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.778
The coolest slide ever!

20:47.780 --> 20:49.780
Let's all slide down, mateys!

20:49.782 --> 20:51.582
I'll go first!

20:51.584 --> 20:54.485
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

20:54.487 --> 20:56.887
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

20:57.756 --> 20:59.257
All right!

20:59.259 --> 21:00.691
[shouting]

21:00.693 --> 21:04.562
If Cubby can be
that brave, so can I.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.797
[both shouting, laughing]

21:09.701 --> 21:11.902
Whoo-hoo!

21:12.571 --> 21:13.804
All right!

21:13.806 --> 21:15.273
Yeah!

21:15.275 --> 21:17.642
[both screaming]

21:18.744 --> 21:20.845
Yo-ho, way to go!

21:20.847 --> 21:22.580
We found the treasure,

21:22.582 --> 21:24.548
we were brave enough
to ride it down,

21:24.550 --> 21:27.485
and we got
four more gold doubloons!

21:27.487 --> 21:29.353
Let's grab 'em and go!

21:29.355 --> 21:32.623
[spits] And I got me boots back.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.795
Mateys, thanks
for stompin' along with me

21:37.797 --> 21:40.798
and the Boots of Bravery!

21:40.800 --> 21:42.433
And thanks
for helping us find

21:42.435 --> 21:44.602
the treasure of Spiky-Pike Peak.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.837
Now let's put
all our gold doubloons

21:46.839 --> 21:48.839
into our Team Treasure Chest.

21:56.381 --> 21:58.616
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:58.618 --> 22:00.584
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

22:00.586 --> 22:02.687
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

22:02.689 --> 22:05.623
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:05.625 --> 22:07.858
Come on. Count with us.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.594
[all] Yeah!

22:10.596 --> 22:15.700
[Cubby] One, two, three, four,

22:15.702 --> 22:20.805
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten!

22:20.807 --> 22:24.008
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:24.010 --> 22:26.544
we got ten gold doubloons.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.813
Guess what, guys?

22:28.815 --> 22:30.848
I don't need
any Boots of Bravery.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.683
I've got something even better:

22:32.685 --> 22:34.852
the Shoes of Cubby!

22:39.424 --> 22:41.792
[Bones] Captain, I've finished
polishin' your boots!

22:41.794 --> 22:44.128
Nice and shiny they are.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.796
Thank you, Bones!

22:45.798 --> 22:49.567
Now stand back
while I, Captain Hook,

22:49.569 --> 22:54.505
slip on
the famous Boots of Bravery!

22:54.507 --> 22:56.874
[gasps, screams]

22:56.876 --> 22:59.110
Abandon ship!

23:01.480 --> 23:03.881
[chortling]

23:06.785 --> 23:09.787
[up-tempo tune plays]

23:09.789 --> 23:11.756
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

23:11.758 --> 23:14.158
¶ I sent out
me invitations ¶

23:14.160 --> 23:16.861
¶ Can't wait
'cause today's the day ¶

23:16.863 --> 23:19.163
¶ You don't need
a reservation ¶

23:19.165 --> 23:21.866
¶ There's no need
to stow away ¶

23:24.503 --> 23:26.871
<i>¶ Jump ship</i>
<i>The crew is hopping ¶</i>

23:26.873 --> 23:29.073
¶ Every matey going overboard

23:29.075 --> 23:31.709
<i>¶ Gangway</i>
<i>The beam is dropping ¶</i>

23:31.711 --> 23:33.978
<i>¶ Bounce, bounce</i>
<i>on the springy board ¶</i>

23:33.980 --> 23:36.447
Whoa-oh-oh!

23:36.449 --> 23:39.550
<i>¶ Now we're jumping</i>
<i>in the drink ¶</i>

23:39.552 --> 23:41.552
<i>¶ It's pool party</i>
<i>and pirate time ¶</i>

23:41.554 --> 23:43.554
<i>¶ Drop in and have a swim </i>

23:43.556 --> 23:47.558
<i>¶ Come on, matey</i>
<i>Water's fine ¶</i>

23:47.560 --> 23:49.960
<i>- ¶ Walking the plank </i>
<i>- ¶ Going over the rail </i>

23:49.962 --> 23:52.496
<i>- ¶ Walking the plank </i>
<i>- ¶ Free boot or free fall </i>

23:52.498 --> 23:54.732
<i>- ¶ Walking the plank </i>
<i>- ¶ Don't tell no tales </i>

23:54.734 --> 23:57.535
<i>- ¶ Walking the plank </i>
<i>-</i> Cannonball!

23:57.537 --> 23:59.870
<i>- ¶ Walking the plank </i>
<i>- ¶ Going over the rail </i>

23:59.872 --> 24:02.840
<i>- ¶ Walking the plank </i>
<i>-</i> Cannonball!

24:05.811 --> 24:07.812
<i>[Bones] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>
