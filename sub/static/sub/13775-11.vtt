00:02.409 --> 00:05.258
ANDRE: Hey, it's your boy,
Andre, in a brand new place.

00:05.381 --> 00:06.648
Check out my new digs.

00:06.716 --> 00:10.619
That's right, dog, <i>casa de Andre,</i>
or as I like to call it, Cassandre.

00:10.686 --> 00:12.721
What are we waiting down here for?

00:12.788 --> 00:14.456
Let's go upstairs.

00:16.172 --> 00:19.728
Now, this room has no name
and serves no purpose.

00:20.745 --> 00:24.786
These brushes used to clean the
floor of a psychiatric hospital.

00:24.906 --> 00:26.168
Now they're here on my table.

00:26.236 --> 00:27.169
Awesome.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.065
Welcome to my dining room,

00:29.076 --> 00:32.946
where the plates are on the
wall, not on the table.

00:33.014 --> 00:33.964
What?

00:34.015 --> 00:38.352
I'm on the ceiling, but
I'm also on the floor.

00:38.436 --> 00:40.837
Oh, looks like you caught me in my towel.

00:40.889 --> 00:42.273
Oops. (Chuckles)

00:42.340 --> 00:43.274
I'm just kidding.

00:43.341 --> 00:44.381
I'm in my regular clothes.

00:44.442 --> 00:46.977
Now it's time to check out
where the magic happens.

00:47.028 --> 00:49.980
I call that the master bedroom.

00:50.031 --> 00:55.286
This is my favorite room in the house, and I...
Whoa, Taco, what are you doing?

00:55.353 --> 00:56.370
TACO: Oh, hey, Andre.

00:56.454 --> 00:57.538
I love this place, man.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.123
It's a great new mattress, too.

00:59.190 --> 01:01.358
No, no, no, no, no, this is...
You have to go.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.409
Oh, are you filming this?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.628
Can you tell me how this looks?

01:04.696 --> 01:05.816
No, no, no, no.

01:11.202 --> 01:12.202
PETE: What's up, guys?

01:12.253 --> 01:13.304
(groaning)

01:13.371 --> 01:14.305
KEVIN: The worst.

01:14.372 --> 01:15.306
For what?

01:15.373 --> 01:16.307
Where were you?

01:16.374 --> 01:17.308
I was out.

01:17.375 --> 01:18.309
Yeah, out with Gina Gibiatti.

01:18.376 --> 01:20.311
Maybe, so, what's the big deal?

01:20.378 --> 01:23.647
You were supposed to assassinate her.
You were supposed to be Jean Reno in.

01:23.715 --> 01:25.649
<i>The Professional,</i> and now
you're just like Gerard Butler

01:25.717 --> 01:26.900
in a Katherine Heigl movie.

01:26.985 --> 01:27.901
Please.

01:27.986 --> 01:28.902
What's up, guys?

01:28.987 --> 01:29.987
Oh, boy.

01:30.054 --> 01:30.988
Best friend club.

01:31.055 --> 01:33.991
Yeah, crotch beer, don't mind if I do.

01:34.058 --> 01:35.743
Mmm.

01:35.827 --> 01:37.161
What's going on, guys?

01:37.228 --> 01:38.729
Getting drunk for end of days?

01:38.780 --> 01:39.747
End of days?

01:39.831 --> 01:41.231
Guys, 12-12-12 is this week.

01:41.282 --> 01:44.368
So according to you, the world's
gonna end in like, a few days?

01:44.419 --> 01:46.537
Yeah, I mean, there will
be a world afterwards.

01:46.588 --> 01:47.371
Okay.

01:47.422 --> 01:49.673
It will be a terrifying
post-apocalyptic horror-scape.

01:49.741 --> 01:51.408
Wait, so we're all dead?

01:51.459 --> 01:52.509
Oh, yeah, tall guy, dead.

01:52.577 --> 01:53.510
What?

01:53.578 --> 01:54.845
Ruxin, dead.

01:54.912 --> 01:57.548
Taco, you're gonna be fine,
until you die, sacrificing

01:57.599 --> 02:00.417
yourself so that bride-guy
here and I can live on.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.418
Oh, I make it?

02:01.469 --> 02:03.420
You and I, we absolutely make it.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.555
We're best friends, right?

02:04.606 --> 02:08.892
It's you, it's me, it's my sister-wife,
Sofia, and it's our baby, Baby Jeffrey.

02:08.943 --> 02:09.925
What about me? Yeah.

02:09.978 --> 02:11.261
Andre.

02:11.312 --> 02:12.396
You live, sort of.

02:12.447 --> 02:15.532
I will keep you as a pet so
that we can use your holes

02:15.600 --> 02:17.951
for sexual pleasure and
as a sort of currency.

02:18.036 --> 02:21.238
We will rent you out and all
of your orifices to marauders.

02:21.289 --> 02:23.290
But I still get to hang
out with you guys?

02:23.375 --> 02:25.125
Yeah, but as a kind of
piece of furniture.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.126
That's kind of fun, though.

02:26.211 --> 02:27.127
I'm in the house.

02:27.212 --> 02:29.112
We're also gonna sell
your dick for gasoline.

02:29.164 --> 02:31.131
Okay, you know what, I
actually should get going.

02:31.216 --> 02:32.132
What?

02:32.217 --> 02:34.251
Yeah, let's not waste all this
time now, let's savor it.

02:34.302 --> 02:35.302
Guys, we're best friends.

02:35.303 --> 02:37.304
Guys, whatever you do,
do not tell him I moved.

02:37.389 --> 02:39.790
JENNY: Welcome to Jenny's
Shiva Bowl diary.

02:39.841 --> 02:42.960
This is the final game
of the regular season.

02:43.027 --> 02:46.129
The only thing standing between
me and the playoffs is Kevin's

02:46.181 --> 02:53.821
shit pile of a team, which I plan on
taking and pushing so far down his throat

02:53.905 --> 02:55.155
he chokes on it.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.575
It's gonna come back up out
his nose, maybe go back into

02:58.643 --> 03:02.479
his mouth, making him an
honest to God shit-sipper.

03:02.547 --> 03:03.664
Don't get me wrong.

03:03.748 --> 03:06.750
I love my husband, but I
intend to beat him lifeless.

03:06.818 --> 03:10.821
I'm going to pin him down by
his throat and start punching

03:10.872 --> 03:15.592
him in the head until he says,
"Sacko, give me the Sacko!"

03:15.660 --> 03:16.860
Mommy?

03:16.928 --> 03:17.928
Oh, my God, Ellie, hey, babe.

03:17.995 --> 03:20.097
Why do you want to beat up Daddy?

03:20.164 --> 03:22.099
I don't want to beat up Daddy.

03:22.166 --> 03:23.467
Are you gonna get a divorce?

03:23.518 --> 03:25.669
What? No, we're not gonna get a divorce.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.837
We live in a great house.

03:26.888 --> 03:28.004
I was making a silly video.

03:28.056 --> 03:29.005
Can I see it?

03:29.057 --> 03:29.840
No!

03:29.891 --> 03:30.841
Aw.

03:30.892 --> 03:31.842
Don't give me the stink eye.

03:31.893 --> 03:32.976
Who taught you that face?

03:33.044 --> 03:34.177
You did.

03:34.229 --> 03:37.014
(growling)

03:37.081 --> 03:39.650
Check it out, my new pad.

03:39.701 --> 03:42.653
You know, I have decorators
I can connect you with.

03:42.704 --> 03:45.205
I don't need one because
I already hired one.

03:45.290 --> 03:48.375
Her dream for me is to create
the ultimate hangout space.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.160
Taco, pop a squat.

03:50.211 --> 03:52.229
Why is there garbage all over the place?

03:52.297 --> 03:54.631
It's not garbage, it's
flotsam from the tsunami.

03:54.699 --> 03:57.033
This washed up on the shores of Hawaii.

03:57.085 --> 03:58.034
Gross.

03:58.086 --> 04:00.237
The seller assured me,
no one died on this.

04:00.305 --> 04:01.472
No, just swimming towards it.

04:01.539 --> 04:03.740
See, it represents hope, and
that's what all good furniture

04:03.808 --> 04:06.143
should do. Now guys... I'm sorry.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.144
It's not a loveseat, Andre.

04:07.211 --> 04:08.145
Hi.

04:08.212 --> 04:09.146
Hey, what's going on?

04:09.213 --> 04:11.148
Hey, just parked in the alley.

04:11.215 --> 04:12.316
I wanted to try something out.

04:12.383 --> 04:13.717
Okay, do we like this here?

04:13.768 --> 04:16.353
Okay, all right.

04:16.404 --> 04:18.322
Or do we like this here?

04:18.389 --> 04:19.356
I like it up there.

04:19.406 --> 04:21.892
No, you know what, I think
it's perfect just like it is.

04:21.942 --> 04:23.494
Oh, well, it was worth a try.

04:23.561 --> 04:24.661
Hi. Hi.

04:24.729 --> 04:26.497
This is my decorator.

04:26.564 --> 04:27.865
Designer.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.500
Trixie Von Stein, hi.

04:29.567 --> 04:30.834
Trixie Von Stein.

04:30.902 --> 04:33.704
Her name was Patricia, but she
changed it and added "Von."

04:33.755 --> 04:35.072
She gave herself a "Von."

04:35.139 --> 04:36.073
Isn't that cool?

04:36.140 --> 04:39.409
RUXIN: Wow, Trixie, one look
at you, and I can say that you

04:39.460 --> 04:42.179
are the perfect person to
design Andre's apartment.

04:42.247 --> 04:43.280
Thank you.

04:43.348 --> 04:45.883
I have so many more ideas, you
know, for instance, over here

04:45.934 --> 04:48.552
going off the owl idea, I want
to find a group of nests,

04:48.603 --> 04:52.105
but I want to put them on something
delicate like, like glass cake stands.

04:52.190 --> 04:54.441
Maybe over there, a bucket
of old children's shoes.

04:54.526 --> 04:56.894
It's like your own
little Holocaust Museum.

04:56.961 --> 04:59.095
Speaking of, I have these
swatches for you to look at.

04:59.147 --> 05:00.113
Okay.

05:00.198 --> 05:02.432
What do you think about one
of those for the ottoman?

05:02.483 --> 05:03.433
I like this animal print one.

05:03.484 --> 05:05.268
You know what, I'm just gonna pick it.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.102
You trust me, don't you?

05:06.154 --> 05:06.937
Of course I trust you.

05:06.988 --> 05:07.771
You have amazing taste.

05:07.822 --> 05:08.622
Thank you, Andre.

05:08.706 --> 05:09.790
Thank you, all right.

05:09.874 --> 05:10.791
Thank you.

05:10.875 --> 05:11.792
All right.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.210
Okay, I'm out. Bye.

05:13.277 --> 05:14.277
Bye.

05:14.329 --> 05:15.462
I'll see you later.

05:15.547 --> 05:16.947
Whoo.

05:16.998 --> 05:19.299
Um... what was that?

05:19.384 --> 05:20.467
Who-who is that exactly?

05:20.552 --> 05:22.302
Trixie. Isn't she great?

05:22.387 --> 05:27.424
Were you guys just... Oh, uh, I don't
mean to brag, but we're... dating.

05:27.475 --> 05:28.559
Oh, no.

05:28.626 --> 05:29.893
You're dating your decorator?

05:29.961 --> 05:31.294
Actually, we're exclusive.

05:31.346 --> 05:32.629
Of course you're exclusive.

05:32.697 --> 05:34.965
Yeah, that just means you're
not masturbating anymore.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.467
I want you to be happy for me;
I found somebody who shares

05:37.518 --> 05:38.468
all my same interests.

05:38.536 --> 05:40.737
Okay, well, what do you
guys like to do together?

05:40.805 --> 05:43.106
Normally we just hang out and
you know, check out some thrift

05:43.157 --> 05:43.941
stores, talk about design.

05:44.008 --> 05:45.688
And then what happens
if you buy something?

05:45.743 --> 05:46.660
Then I pay her.

05:46.744 --> 05:48.495
Andre, this is prostitution adjacent.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.163
No, it's not adjacent to prostitution.

05:50.248 --> 05:51.014
Really?

05:51.082 --> 05:52.950
So how much does she charge you?

05:53.017 --> 05:53.951
25%.

05:54.002 --> 05:57.154
Does that include full-on penetration
or is that just hand and mouth stuff?

05:57.221 --> 05:59.155
No, she's my girlfriend.

05:59.207 --> 06:01.008
So you just pay for anal?

06:01.092 --> 06:02.659
No, I don't pay for anything.

06:02.727 --> 06:04.995
If you're into whores, I know
some that are way cheaper

06:05.063 --> 06:07.264
and have much better taste in furniture.

06:07.332 --> 06:10.267
Good morning, Christopher.

06:10.334 --> 06:11.334
My little C.B.

06:11.386 --> 06:12.536
is getting so big.

06:12.604 --> 06:13.637
C.B.?

06:13.688 --> 06:14.805
Chalupa Batman.

06:14.872 --> 06:15.973
No, no, no, no, no.

06:16.024 --> 06:17.841
It's a very unique name, babe.

06:17.892 --> 06:21.528
You can't call him Chalupa Batman; he
is not a Tijuana street meat superhero.

06:21.613 --> 06:22.946
(phone vibrates)

06:23.014 --> 06:28.185
Oh, Matt Forte is injured again and
he will be replaced by Michael Bush.

06:28.252 --> 06:29.186
Hmm, interesting.

06:29.253 --> 06:30.320
Yep.

06:30.388 --> 06:33.023
Michael Bush is a free agent right now.

06:33.091 --> 06:34.291
Yes, he is.

06:34.359 --> 06:36.727
Hmm.

06:36.794 --> 06:37.711
No!

06:37.795 --> 06:38.829
No, you will not.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.497
(groans)

06:40.548 --> 06:42.032
He's mine!

06:42.100 --> 06:43.300
You don't even need him!

06:43.367 --> 06:45.302
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!

06:45.369 --> 06:47.704
Mine, mine, whoa!

06:47.755 --> 06:49.172
Whoa!

06:49.223 --> 06:51.308
Oh, my God, babe, are you okay?

06:51.375 --> 06:52.309
Oh, my head.

06:52.377 --> 06:54.344
Yeah, it's really slippery over there.

06:54.395 --> 06:56.513
You got to be careful.

06:58.599 --> 06:59.850
Oh, my God, babe.

06:59.901 --> 07:00.984
Oh, it hurts so bad.

07:01.052 --> 07:03.236
Yeah, let me, um... I'm
gonna get you some ice.

07:03.321 --> 07:05.022
No, no, I need to get up
and get Michael Bush.

07:05.073 --> 07:06.389
He's not getable.

07:06.441 --> 07:10.769
(whining): No... no...

07:17.982 --> 07:20.017
See it's all black and blue and
it's tender over here... it

07:20.084 --> 07:21.151
really hurts, my head's ringing.

07:21.219 --> 07:26.158
You may be the first person in history
to get a fantasy football concussion.

07:26.278 --> 07:29.047
Commissioner, we got to protect our
players from these concussions.

07:29.115 --> 07:33.051
I don't really see any correlation between
an injury sustained during a fantasy

07:33.119 --> 07:35.620
football match up and long-term problems.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.622
Is this really how we're
gonna treat our players?

07:37.690 --> 07:38.650
Tell me the story again.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.442
You were both running for the computer.

07:40.526 --> 07:44.295
You fell, she picked up the player...
I mean, this sounds a little...

07:44.363 --> 07:47.032
I would say that there
has been foul play here.

07:47.099 --> 07:49.968
Are you insinuating I put a
bounty on my own husband's head?

07:50.036 --> 07:53.438
In the video post you said that
you wanted to take him out.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.606
It was a joke.

07:54.673 --> 07:56.908
You're on the message boards all
the time saying that you're

07:56.976 --> 07:58.043
gonna put your D up Kevin's B.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.244
Do you?

07:59.295 --> 08:01.880
No, because he is Pete's property.

08:01.947 --> 08:05.750
I think it's time to start throwing
around some suspensions willy-nilly.

08:05.801 --> 08:08.586
With my concussion and my
headaches, I do still have to

08:08.654 --> 08:11.756
set a lineup this week and I think
I might deserve some points.

08:11.807 --> 08:14.292
No way... that is bullshit.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.326
Hello.

08:15.394 --> 08:16.928
Hey, what's going on?

08:16.979 --> 08:18.296
Good to see you.

08:18.347 --> 08:21.132
I have found the perfect occasional
chair for that corner over there.

08:21.183 --> 08:23.968
Wait, I thought we already have an
occasional chair in that corner.

08:24.019 --> 08:25.803
We do, but it's really too threatening.

08:25.855 --> 08:27.805
I don't think it's too
threatening, I mean, maybe we

08:27.857 --> 08:28.806
should just keep it, right?

08:28.858 --> 08:30.909
Baby, I want this chair...
you're gonna love it.

08:30.976 --> 08:31.910
It's gonna be perfect.

08:31.977 --> 08:32.977
It's gonna make the room.

08:32.977 --> 08:34.412
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.413
Yes? Yes?

08:35.481 --> 08:36.780
Yes, all right, let's do it.

08:36.832 --> 08:39.451
You're gonna love it,
you're gonna love it.

08:39.518 --> 08:40.452
It's great.

08:40.519 --> 08:41.753
It's $5,500.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.188
Well, that's not that bad.

08:43.255 --> 08:44.756
And don't forget the 25%

08:44.823 --> 08:45.757
commission.

08:45.824 --> 08:49.094
So, don't forget to add an extra $1,100?

08:49.161 --> 08:50.261
$1,375.

08:50.329 --> 08:51.262
Oh.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.263
It's 25%.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.432
All right, and that is for you.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.300
Thank you.

08:55.367 --> 08:56.301
All right, let's bring it up.

08:56.368 --> 08:57.302
Want to see?

08:57.353 --> 08:59.170
Who wants to sit in it first?

08:59.221 --> 09:01.005
None of us.

09:01.073 --> 09:04.275
I think it's obvious that
there is a big problem here.

09:04.343 --> 09:07.278
Yeah, this guy is getting fleeced...
we got to do something about this.

09:07.346 --> 09:11.149
Is there the slightest possibility
that she actually really likes him?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.350
No, God, no.

09:12.401 --> 09:14.369
No, impossible... nobody can
love Andre the way that we can

09:14.453 --> 09:17.789
love Andre, and we cannot stand Andre.

09:19.859 --> 09:22.193
All right, you ready to
do this shit with Andre?

09:22.244 --> 09:23.211
Yeah, there's Pete.

09:23.295 --> 09:25.713
Oh, hey, guys... come on over.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.665
Ooh.

09:27.716 --> 09:28.699
Are those the Gibiatti?

09:28.751 --> 09:31.236
Look who it is... the Herdsman.

09:31.303 --> 09:32.303
Guys, come on.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.304
Oh, buttocks.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.672
Herdsmen, yeah.

09:34.723 --> 09:36.508
So, uh, we're hanging out
with the Gibiattis now.

09:36.559 --> 09:37.509
Yeah, it's fun, huh?

09:37.560 --> 09:39.511
Is that tie from the
Clay Aiken collection?

09:39.562 --> 09:41.346
It's actually a Brooks Brothers tie.

09:41.397 --> 09:44.182
I didn't know the Brooks Brothers
were having sex with each other.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.183
Guys, isn't this great?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.184
This is just like high school.

09:46.235 --> 09:47.318
It's fun.

09:47.386 --> 09:48.319
30 K.

09:48.387 --> 09:49.687
30 K for what?

09:49.738 --> 09:52.524
Gina has this fun game where she
just shouts out how much she

09:52.575 --> 09:54.926
would charge for random
people to have sex with her.

09:54.994 --> 10:00.365
That means she would charge you $30,000
to let your repugnant shmeckle in her

10:00.416 --> 10:02.700
perfect vagina.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.920
My sister's vagina belongs in the Louvre.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.089
Why, because a bunch of
Frenchmen have been in it?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.591
Yeah, and Belgians.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.210
Yeah, everyone from Benelux,
man... she banged a dude from

10:12.261 --> 10:14.212
Luxembourg... there's
like ten people there.

10:14.263 --> 10:16.214
This is just so much fun... the
gang's all back together.

10:16.265 --> 10:17.048
Really?

10:17.099 --> 10:18.049
Really. (Grunts)

10:18.100 --> 10:19.884
Ah, yeah, get in there, Gibiatti.

10:19.935 --> 10:21.553
Really.

10:21.604 --> 10:22.687
Gibiatti, last shot, take it.

10:22.755 --> 10:23.721
No, Gibiatti, you do it.

10:23.772 --> 10:25.557
Gibiatti, do it, do it Do it.

10:25.608 --> 10:26.591
Do it, Gibiatti.

10:26.642 --> 10:27.425
Eat me.

10:27.476 --> 10:28.426
Eat me, you eat me.

10:28.477 --> 10:29.527
Eat me!

10:29.595 --> 10:30.928
Take it, take it, you slut.

10:30.980 --> 10:31.929
Yeah!

10:31.981 --> 10:32.930
Whoa.

10:32.982 --> 10:33.931
Oh, get in there.

10:33.983 --> 10:35.700
Look at me when she's kissing him.

10:35.768 --> 10:36.701
Okay.

10:36.768 --> 10:39.537
We got to go... our grandma
fractured her ankle chasing a

10:39.605 --> 10:41.873
black paperboy away from our house.

10:41.940 --> 10:45.126
All right. Ooh.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.212
See, guys... I told you it's not that bad.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.213
Are you joking me?

10:48.280 --> 10:49.214
They are confirmed psychopaths.

10:49.281 --> 10:52.217
How is what they did to you
different from what we do to Andre?

10:52.284 --> 10:55.086
That's... That's coming
from a place of love.

10:55.137 --> 10:56.221
Hey, hey, hey.

10:56.288 --> 10:57.472
What's going on, guys?

10:57.556 --> 10:58.473
What's going on?

10:58.557 --> 10:59.474
I got some bad news.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.309
What... wait, did you and Trixie break up?

11:01.393 --> 11:03.428
No, that's going great, it's
just my house has been a little

11:03.479 --> 11:07.131
cold, so I'm thinking of
having a housewarming party!

11:07.182 --> 11:08.466
All right, come on, you guys in?

11:08.517 --> 11:10.557
I am in because I love the
way your apartment looks.

11:10.569 --> 11:11.486
You love it?

11:11.570 --> 11:12.320
Yeah.

11:12.404 --> 11:14.138
Well, I love your personal style.

11:14.189 --> 11:15.139
Wait, what? No.

11:15.190 --> 11:18.070
Yeah, we were talking about how we
don't even think you need a decorator.

11:18.077 --> 11:20.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we love what you
did, and not so much the Trixie stuff.

11:21.080 --> 11:21.996
No, you guys hate my style.

11:22.081 --> 11:22.997
No way, man.

11:23.082 --> 11:23.831
No, we love it.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.851
Then how come you guys never come with
me when I ask you to go shopping?

11:26.919 --> 11:27.835
Well, we'd love to go.

11:27.920 --> 11:28.920
We'd love to, yeah.

11:28.987 --> 11:30.121
You guys would love to go?

11:30.172 --> 11:31.122
We're gonna do it.

11:31.173 --> 11:33.124
It's a shopping date.

11:36.595 --> 11:37.512
No.

11:37.596 --> 11:39.514
Yeah, you got to get in there.

11:39.598 --> 11:43.134
Yeah, you look like a
gangster from Brussels.

11:43.185 --> 11:45.169
Well, don't worry, you're next.

11:45.237 --> 11:46.337
Come on, come on.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.940
Your turn, your turn.

11:49.008 --> 11:50.875
It's perfect.

11:50.943 --> 11:54.145
Yeah, I don't think this is quite
the right style for me, Andre.

11:54.196 --> 11:55.146
Come on, what do you mean?

11:55.214 --> 11:56.147
You don't trust my taste?

11:56.198 --> 11:59.984
No, I trust your... (laughing): Ooh!

12:00.052 --> 12:01.386
It's great, right?

12:01.453 --> 12:02.687
I love it.

12:02.755 --> 12:03.821
Check out his belt buckle.

12:03.872 --> 12:07.825
It's a belt buckle like a shiny
football because I love football.

12:07.876 --> 12:10.728
I love it when a belt buckle
reflects what someone's hobbies are.

12:10.796 --> 12:15.032
Wow, are you supposed to
see the individual grapes?

12:15.084 --> 12:18.303
Because we can see the whole vine.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.224
This is awesome.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.144
Heh-heh, yeah, Dre Tones in the house.

12:26.211 --> 12:28.396
Oh, my God, guys, this is so much fun.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.047
Oh, my God!

12:30.099 --> 12:32.383
What happened to you?

12:32.434 --> 12:33.401
We went shopping.

12:33.485 --> 12:36.404
You look like the oldest boy
band ever, and Ruxin, you look

12:36.488 --> 12:38.222
like their creepy gay manager.

12:38.273 --> 12:39.524
Kev, what are you wearing?

12:39.575 --> 12:41.359
It's my new clothes... I love them.

12:41.410 --> 12:42.243
ALL: We love them.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.394
See? They love them.

12:43.445 --> 12:48.566
I can't even process all of this right
now because I have the biggest news.

12:48.617 --> 12:49.567
What?

12:49.618 --> 12:52.670
The walkthrough of your old apartment,
that is happening this afternoon.

12:52.738 --> 12:53.671
I know the buyer.

12:53.739 --> 12:54.672
Yeah, who cares?

12:54.740 --> 12:56.073
Oh, it's only Deion Sanders.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.908
What... Deion Sanders?!

12:57.960 --> 12:59.761
Deion mother-scratching Sanders.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.912
I almost drafted him this
year... I love Deion Sanders.

13:01.964 --> 13:03.881
He's like a black version of me.

13:03.932 --> 13:04.882
This is awesome.

13:04.933 --> 13:07.552
Mr. Sanders, you really saw past
all the atrocious furniture

13:07.603 --> 13:09.387
to see the beautiful bones of this lot.

13:09.438 --> 13:10.388
I like it, I really do.

13:10.439 --> 13:11.356
It's all yours now.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.391
I'm obviously a huge fan, and
you're Prime Time, right?

13:13.442 --> 13:14.025
Right.

13:14.092 --> 13:15.052
People call me Dre Time.

13:15.093 --> 13:16.027
No one calls you that.

13:16.094 --> 13:17.028
People should call me that.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.030
You can't give yourself a
nickname... you got to earn it.

13:19.097 --> 13:21.032
Do you want to call me Dre Time?

13:21.099 --> 13:21.866
No.

13:21.933 --> 13:22.867
Do you?

13:22.934 --> 13:23.618
Nope.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.703
And, by the way, just because
you're the buyer and I'm the

13:25.771 --> 13:27.705
seller, there's no law that
says we can't be best friends.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.540
Can we double check that, please?

13:29.608 --> 13:32.377
Absolutely, and if it is not a law,
we will put it in the contract.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.378
Thank you, Mrs. MacArthur.

13:33.445 --> 13:34.379
Oh, call me Jenny.

13:34.446 --> 13:35.380
Can I call you J Time?

13:35.447 --> 13:36.381
I like that.

13:36.448 --> 13:37.382
Is that cool?

13:37.449 --> 13:38.383
Yeah, J Time.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.418
J Time, Prime Time, Dre Time.

13:40.469 --> 13:41.719
No Time, how about that?

13:41.787 --> 13:42.720
No Time?

13:42.788 --> 13:43.721
I don't like No Time.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.556
It has a ring to it, doesn't it?

13:45.624 --> 13:46.557
It really does.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.558
It suits you.

13:47.626 --> 13:48.893
Hey, Andre, oh, my goodness.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.628
What is this?

13:50.679 --> 13:51.629
Deion Sanders?

13:51.680 --> 13:53.464
I told you guys to wait in the car.

13:53.515 --> 13:57.652
We just had to pee and here you are...
(laughing) This is good.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.470
You can't be friends, right?

13:59.521 --> 14:02.907
Because no one told the other
person how they really look.

14:02.974 --> 14:03.941
Are you guys a boy band?

14:03.992 --> 14:05.943
When we all hang out, people
like to call us the Dre Tones.

14:05.994 --> 14:07.412
Nope, not the Dre Tones.

14:07.479 --> 14:08.913
Yeah, I got one better, okay.

14:08.980 --> 14:09.914
Old Kids on the Block.

14:09.981 --> 14:10.915
That's a good one.

14:10.982 --> 14:12.750
What about the Old Street Boys?

14:12.818 --> 14:13.818
I got one more, one more.

14:13.869 --> 14:15.319
Bell Biv the Old.

14:15.370 --> 14:17.154
Well, these clothes are poison.

14:17.206 --> 14:18.989
Where's the rest of your turtleneck?

14:19.041 --> 14:19.841
It's an infinity scarf.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.460
What did you do with the rest of
the curtain when you cut it up?

14:22.511 --> 14:23.294
Big fan, Deion.

14:23.345 --> 14:25.179
Would you like to go take a
look at the patio upstairs?

14:25.264 --> 14:26.104
No, I love this view.

14:26.164 --> 14:28.299
I love this view. Can I just
put a chair right here?

14:28.350 --> 14:29.267
Did you see that sweater?

14:29.334 --> 14:30.301
Thanks, Andre.

14:30.352 --> 14:32.186
What is going on with you guys?

14:32.271 --> 14:35.973
See, I can only dress you monkeys, but
I need you guys to bring the attitude

14:36.024 --> 14:37.108
in your faces.

14:37.175 --> 14:39.176
Smiles up, and the clothes go up.

14:39.228 --> 14:41.863
So get some swag, you bunch of bitches.

14:41.947 --> 14:45.116
Now, Prime Time, let me tell you
a little bit about Dre Time.

14:45.183 --> 14:46.117
What's going on here?

14:46.184 --> 14:48.202
We just got ripped by
Andre and Deion Sanders.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.204
Have you seen what we're wearing?

14:50.289 --> 14:52.206
I would make fun of us if I were him.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.207
I can't take this anymore.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.375
It's itching me to death.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.461
You know what, enough of these
bullshit games, enough of

14:56.528 --> 14:58.696
the clothes, we just got to shoot
straight with Andre, okay?

14:58.747 --> 14:59.697
(laughs) Okay, that's cool.

14:59.748 --> 15:02.166
Deion told me to take off
the "Time"... it's cool.

15:02.217 --> 15:04.201
It's time for us to have
a serious conversation.

15:04.253 --> 15:05.870
Oh, hash tag real talk, I'm in.

15:05.921 --> 15:09.340
We appreciate that you like Trixie,
but that girl is using you.

15:09.391 --> 15:10.341
She likes me.

15:10.392 --> 15:11.342
Well, then prove it.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.729
Fire her as your decorator and see if
she sticks around as your girlfriend.

15:14.813 --> 15:17.064
I'm not firing her because you
guys think I should, okay?

15:17.149 --> 15:20.234
Well, then maybe we'll just
have to give Mr. Deion Sanders

15:20.319 --> 15:22.854
the full jizz-closure about what
happened in his new apartment.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.156
I wonder if Mr. Deion
Sanders has a DVD player.

15:25.223 --> 15:26.157
Put that away.

15:26.224 --> 15:28.493
We're gonna tell Prime
Time all about slime time.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.694
Mm-hmm.

15:29.745 --> 15:30.728
Do what you got to do.

15:30.779 --> 15:31.739
So everything look good?

15:31.780 --> 15:32.563
Looks great.

15:32.614 --> 15:33.564
Great.

15:33.615 --> 15:37.168
So, No Time, is there anything else
that I should know about this place?

15:37.235 --> 15:38.235
No.

15:38.287 --> 15:39.236
Deal.

15:39.288 --> 15:40.671
Great, we have got a deal.

15:40.739 --> 15:41.672
Thank you so much.

15:41.740 --> 15:42.507
J Time.

15:42.574 --> 15:43.341
J Time.

15:43.408 --> 15:44.912
Dre Time.

15:45.032 --> 15:46.243
No Time.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.047
Yes? Yes?

15:55.114 --> 15:56.995
Is that a Welker connection?

15:57.115 --> 15:58.048
Oh, my God.

15:58.116 --> 15:59.276
Do you have any players left?

15:59.301 --> 16:00.084
Nope.

16:00.152 --> 16:00.918
Do you have a kicker?

16:00.986 --> 16:01.752
Nope.

16:01.820 --> 16:02.586
What about your flex?

16:02.654 --> 16:03.620
Are you kidding me?

16:03.672 --> 16:04.832
Oh, you know what, I'm sorry.

16:04.856 --> 16:05.923
I take that back.

16:05.974 --> 16:08.592
There is one player that I
didn't get a chance to use.

16:08.643 --> 16:10.261
Do you know who that might be?

16:10.312 --> 16:14.064
Michael Bush because he was stolen
right out from underneath me.

16:14.132 --> 16:15.065
No, no, no, no.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.500
He was not stolen.

16:16.568 --> 16:18.936
I was going to get him, and
then you pushed me into a

16:18.987 --> 16:21.338
wall and then you threw me into a chair.

16:21.406 --> 16:22.439
That was karma, Kevin.

16:22.507 --> 16:23.741
You had that coming.

16:23.809 --> 16:27.011
You were lucky your face is the only thing
that smashed into that chair, okay?

16:27.078 --> 16:28.412
What's that supposed to mean?

16:28.480 --> 16:29.914
I've lost before, okay?

16:29.981 --> 16:32.583
And when I lose, I lose graciously.

16:32.650 --> 16:33.584
Well, I don't!

16:33.651 --> 16:34.585
Clearly.

16:34.652 --> 16:35.586
I don't, okay?

16:35.653 --> 16:36.921
You've already won, Kevin.

16:36.988 --> 16:40.508
Oh, yeah, I won, but it's sort
of like Seattle over Green Bay.

16:40.592 --> 16:41.759
Nobody believes me.

16:41.827 --> 16:43.460
I wanted to win for real.

16:43.512 --> 16:45.629
Everything comes with
an asterisk in my life.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.432
My name has an asterisk, all
my wins, my son's dick.

16:48.499 --> 16:50.167
(raspberry) What is that?

16:50.218 --> 16:52.970
Half off, just like ShopRite.

16:53.021 --> 16:56.340
I just wanted something that I
could do on my own, and it means

16:56.391 --> 17:02.029
that I accomplished it, but now I
can't, 'cause I'm out of the playoffs

17:02.113 --> 17:04.448
and you knocked me out, and
everybody's gonna make fun

17:04.516 --> 17:07.201
of me, and now everybody's gonna...
(sobbing)

17:07.285 --> 17:09.386
Just wanted it for myself.

17:09.454 --> 17:11.655
Oh, God!

17:11.705 --> 17:13.457
Why?

17:13.523 --> 17:14.892
Daddy, are you okay?

17:14.960 --> 17:16.359
Yeah, yeah, honey, I'm fine.

17:16.428 --> 17:18.829
Just... Daddy needs a minute, okay?

17:18.896 --> 17:20.130
Did Mommy beat you?

17:20.198 --> 17:21.165
Yes!

17:21.233 --> 17:22.333
Yes, she beat me.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.467
She beat me bad.

17:23.534 --> 17:24.835
Daddy, do you need my help?

17:24.903 --> 17:25.886
Nobody can help me.

17:25.971 --> 17:27.637
It's my fault.

17:27.705 --> 17:29.539
And Jermichael Finley's.

17:29.591 --> 17:30.975
(sobbing): Oh, no.

17:31.042 --> 17:32.710
I can help you.

17:32.777 --> 17:34.878
It hurts so bad!

17:36.932 --> 17:38.415
(line ringing)

17:38.483 --> 17:39.984
911, what's your emergency?

17:40.051 --> 17:42.903
(pounding on door)

17:42.988 --> 17:45.823
Whoa, you guys are strippers.

17:45.891 --> 17:50.411
Pete sent me strippers 'cause
I won, I won, oh, yeah.

17:50.495 --> 17:51.579
Ma'am, we're not strippers.

17:51.663 --> 17:52.746
Okay, we get that a lot.

17:52.831 --> 17:54.898
We actually got a domestic violence call.

17:54.950 --> 17:55.933
What?

17:56.001 --> 17:57.067
No, I'm fine.

17:57.135 --> 17:59.069
We're actually talking
about your husband.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.422
That doesn't... Hey, guys.

18:01.506 --> 18:02.572
Hey, are you okay?

18:02.624 --> 18:04.174
Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

18:04.242 --> 18:07.211
It's just, you know, it's
not a happy household.

18:07.262 --> 18:08.679
No, we're super happy.

18:08.746 --> 18:09.680
We're fine.

18:09.747 --> 18:10.764
Half of us are happy.

18:10.849 --> 18:15.769
I mean, we're just a little emotional, I...
She just beat me so... Uh, no, no.

18:15.854 --> 18:17.855
A little diffi... No.

18:17.922 --> 18:18.889
I'm sorry, you're right.

18:18.940 --> 18:20.941
It's my fault, and I
made some bad decisions.

18:21.026 --> 18:22.026
Yeah, you did, but he's fine.

18:22.093 --> 18:24.094
Why don't you guys, uh, just come in.

18:24.162 --> 18:27.064
You can set up and do your little
dance, and I'll just... Kevin...

18:27.115 --> 18:27.898
Don't grab him.

18:27.949 --> 18:28.732
Do not grab him.

18:28.783 --> 18:29.733
Matter of fact, come with me.

18:29.784 --> 18:30.784
Oh, my God, Kevin, Kevin.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.604
Whoa, whoa, where you guys... Why
are you going with the strippers?

18:33.672 --> 18:34.605
They're not strippers.

18:34.656 --> 18:35.439
What?

18:35.490 --> 18:37.374
Oh, no, no, no, guys, guys.

18:37.442 --> 18:39.543
No, no, she didn't beat me.

18:39.610 --> 18:40.961
No, I'm a man.

18:41.046 --> 18:42.880
Welcome, my married friends.

18:42.948 --> 18:44.081
How are you?

18:44.149 --> 18:46.383
So glad you made parole
in time for the party.

18:46.451 --> 18:49.086
Yeah, well, I don't so much
mind doing time as long as I'm

18:49.137 --> 18:50.421
doing time in the playoffs.

18:50.472 --> 18:52.589
I'm so happy for her.

18:52.641 --> 18:54.458
Poor Deion Sanders.

18:54.509 --> 18:57.328
This is not the way I
wanted you to see us.

18:57.395 --> 19:00.597
Oh, hello, Ruxin.

19:00.649 --> 19:01.809
You remember Gina, of course.

19:01.816 --> 19:02.766
Hi, Gina.

19:02.817 --> 19:04.802
We were just showing Gina
this fine apartment.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.137
I haven't upper-decked
anybody for years, but this

19:07.205 --> 19:09.406
place, I'm gonna bring the
move out of retirement.

19:09.474 --> 19:11.408
Whoa, whoa, what are you guys doing?
I thought we were

19:11.476 --> 19:12.409
all wearing Andre clothes.

19:12.477 --> 19:14.495
No, that was just for one day. (Chuckles)

19:14.579 --> 19:15.913
Oh, man.

19:15.980 --> 19:16.981
You look like an asshole.

19:17.048 --> 19:19.616
Yeah, well, you look... super hot.

19:19.668 --> 19:20.617
Hi.

19:20.685 --> 19:22.670
Hi. How are you?

19:22.754 --> 19:23.837
Look at you, party girl.

19:23.922 --> 19:25.756
Hey, Trixie. How are you?

19:25.823 --> 19:27.324
Hi, guys.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.343
Well, the place is really something.

19:29.427 --> 19:30.594
Thank you. Thank you so much.

19:30.661 --> 19:34.014
But it does seem that the designing is
now coming to an end, I guess, huh?

19:34.099 --> 19:35.933
Oh, no, design is never done.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.353
So this could go on for years, Andre.
What are you gonna do about that?

19:39.437 --> 19:41.505
I can answer that with a toast.

19:41.573 --> 19:44.608
Tonight's a very special night,
not just because it's 12-12-12,

19:44.676 --> 19:48.278
but because we are celebrating
a guest of honor.

19:48.346 --> 19:50.280
Trixie, will you join me up here?

19:50.348 --> 19:51.532
Oh, up here? Oh, gosh.

19:51.616 --> 19:55.703
A round of applause for the
decorator who changed my life.

19:55.787 --> 19:57.521
Thank you.

19:57.589 --> 19:59.373
Enough.

19:59.457 --> 20:02.025
Trixie, you have transformed
this apartment, but today, it's

20:02.077 --> 20:03.711
your last day as my decorator.

20:03.795 --> 20:05.462
What?

20:05.530 --> 20:08.332
Here's your final check.

20:08.383 --> 20:09.717
Open it.

20:09.801 --> 20:12.002
What, here, in front of everybody?

20:12.053 --> 20:14.221
I want them all to see this.

20:16.707 --> 20:18.041
Oh, my God.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.709
Oh, my God.

20:19.761 --> 20:26.150
Oh, sh... Adam Levine once tweeted,
"Chemistry cannot be purchased."

20:26.217 --> 20:28.585
Even though you and I have
purchased so many things from

20:28.653 --> 20:32.489
color-coordinated books to street art and
ironic terrariums, there's one thing

20:32.557 --> 20:37.194
that I want to purchase that money can't
buy, and that is your undying love.

20:37.245 --> 20:40.731
Trixie Von Stein, will you
make me Andre Von Nozick?

20:40.799 --> 20:42.666
Oh, my God.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.251
Oh, my God, yes.

20:44.335 --> 20:45.269
Yes?

20:45.336 --> 20:46.253
Yes.

20:46.337 --> 20:47.337
Oh, my God.

20:47.405 --> 20:48.405
Oh, my goodness.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.240
We're engaged!

20:50.308 --> 20:51.908
We're engaged!

20:51.960 --> 20:54.762
That's gonna be a lot more
expensive than her decorating.

20:54.846 --> 20:55.879
Oh, it's beautiful.

20:55.930 --> 20:57.047
Look at that.

20:57.098 --> 20:58.265
This is balls crazy.

20:58.349 --> 21:00.267
I guess crazier things have happened.

21:00.351 --> 21:03.587
I mean, I never thought that Gina
Gibiatti would be my girlfriend.

21:03.638 --> 21:04.855
Excuse me?

21:04.922 --> 21:06.190
Your girlfriend?

21:06.257 --> 21:07.257
Take it easy.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.442
We're at a party.

21:08.526 --> 21:11.895
How crack piped out are you to think that
I would actually be your girlfriend?

21:11.946 --> 21:14.097
I don't know, we've been
sleeping at each other's houses.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.266
I thought maybe we were exclusive.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.401
Uh, no.

21:17.452 --> 21:20.270
You were a pity (bleep).

21:20.321 --> 21:21.622
Oh, are you crying?

21:21.706 --> 21:22.623
No.

21:22.707 --> 21:24.274
Oh, there they go.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.626
That is so pathetic.

21:25.710 --> 21:26.627
Oh, my God, okay.

21:26.711 --> 21:27.628
Mm, I'm leaving.

21:27.712 --> 21:28.629
Take that.

21:28.713 --> 21:29.630
Okay.

21:29.714 --> 21:30.631
You two.

21:30.715 --> 21:31.615
Yeah?

21:31.666 --> 21:34.618
Left you guys a little engagement
present in your downstairs bathroom.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.086
Enjoy.

21:36.137 --> 21:37.554
Later, bitches.

21:37.622 --> 21:41.058
She just upper-decked your heart, bro.

21:41.126 --> 21:43.126
BOTH: What a night.

21:50.154 --> 21:52.318
Okay, good, looks great.

21:52.438 --> 21:53.405
Yeah, you're just moaning.

21:53.456 --> 21:54.456
Yeah, that's good.

21:54.541 --> 21:56.575
He's getting ready to plunge the knife.

21:56.626 --> 21:57.710
Okay, take one.

21:57.777 --> 22:00.412
"12-12-12: The Mayan Cock-pocalypse."

22:00.463 --> 22:01.880
Dude, that's not what it is.

22:01.948 --> 22:04.883
It's "12-12-12: The Mayan A-cock-alypse."

22:04.951 --> 22:05.918
No, I'm sorry, it's not.

22:05.969 --> 22:06.952
We decided this.

22:07.003 --> 22:09.955
The movie should be called
"12-12-12: The Mayan A-cock-alypse."

22:10.006 --> 22:10.956
"Cock-pocalypse."

22:11.024 --> 22:11.984
"A Mayan A-cock-alypse."

22:12.008 --> 22:12.958
"Cock-pocalypse."

22:13.009 --> 22:15.794
Dude, what... What would
you say if you saw it?

22:15.845 --> 22:16.628
What do you think it is?

22:16.680 --> 22:18.314
My agent said it's "The Cock-and-lips."

22:18.398 --> 22:19.565
"The Cock-and-lips."

22:19.632 --> 22:21.066
That's better is what it is.

22:21.134 --> 22:22.651
Lock it up!

22:22.736 --> 22:25.938
"12-12-12: The Mayan Cock-and-lips."

22:25.989 --> 22:26.972
I love you.

22:27.023 --> 22:28.073
So sad that this is it.

22:28.141 --> 22:30.743
I know, this is it, but we're
going out in a blaze of glory.

22:30.810 --> 22:31.577
Start moaning.

22:31.644 --> 22:32.945
You're wet for death. Action.

22:32.996 --> 22:34.163
Oh, yeah?

22:34.247 --> 22:36.148
(moaning)

22:36.199 --> 22:38.283
Boom.

22:38.335 --> 22:39.284
Boom.

22:39.336 --> 22:40.285
Oh, yeah.

22:40.337 --> 22:41.286
Boom. Boom.

22:41.338 --> 22:42.320
What?

22:42.372 --> 22:43.332
The boom is in the shot.

22:43.373 --> 22:44.322
It's not a boom right now.

22:44.374 --> 22:45.323
It's my sound dick.

22:45.375 --> 22:46.324
What is a sound dick?

22:46.376 --> 22:47.459
Look at this. Boom.

22:47.510 --> 22:49.428
Why aren't you filming this?

22:49.495 --> 22:50.429
This is amazing.

22:50.496 --> 22:53.331
Everybody here with a
dick is now obsolete.

22:53.383 --> 22:54.504
My dick can't hear anything.

22:54.551 --> 22:56.334
Holy God, that's awesome.

22:56.386 --> 22:57.836
Yeah.

22:57.887 --> 23:00.189
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on in here?

23:00.273 --> 23:01.190
Who the hell are you?

23:01.274 --> 23:02.191
I'm Deion Sanders.

23:02.275 --> 23:03.542
More importantly, who are you?

23:03.610 --> 23:05.944
I'm Dirty Randy, and you, my
friend, are a thousand times

23:06.012 --> 23:07.613
better looking than your headshot.

23:07.681 --> 23:09.314
Get your coat off and get in here.

23:09.366 --> 23:10.315
Get in here, man, come on.

23:10.367 --> 23:11.150
Are y'all serious?

23:11.201 --> 23:12.951
I think I'm coming out of
retirement for this one.

23:13.019 --> 23:14.921
Whoa, whoa, what?

23:15.041 --> 23:17.985
Buddy, I don't know who you are,
but you're about to get chlamydia.
