WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:04.813
Part of you is still trapped
in that cabin.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.638
You're seeing things that aren't there.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.474
You're not gonna shoot me.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.376
I shot an innocent man

00:10.411 --> 00:12.496
because I can't stop seeing Stahl.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.313
Quince took my mom.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.916
There's the two murders
your dad covered up.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.084
You really don't know your dad, do you?

00:19.119 --> 00:21.319
I still have the photo
of you and Donnie on the boat.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.488
- Are you gay?
- She's an escort.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.623
- What's your name?
- Harlee.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.758
Agent Stahl had very clear instructions.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.326
You were his fantasy. Do you really

00:28.361 --> 00:30.328
- wanna hear all this?
- Until he's caught.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.596
- I saw him again.
- Stahl?

00:31.631 --> 00:34.599
I swear that he was real.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.202
You can't act as if it never happened.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.836
No!

00:38.871 --> 00:40.338
No.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.207
The guy who did it... Cesar Molina...

00:42.242 --> 00:45.443
- is an apparent suicide.
- Unless you look closer.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.512
- And if you decide not to?
- I still want Quince.

00:48.547 --> 00:50.180
Not the terms you agreed on?

00:50.216 --> 00:52.717
Nava's dead and his killer
probably wears a badge.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.284
The Intelligence Unit

00:54.320 --> 00:56.253
is more dangerous than you realize.

00:56.288 --> 00:57.855
I'm glad you got your revenge, Woz.

00:57.890 --> 01:00.557
I hope that it cures
everything that you need.

T12.

02:10.425 --> 02:12.031
Send that vertebrae some good thoughts.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.966
It's your new best friend.

02:14.002 --> 02:16.245
Isn't the 11 gonna get jealous?

02:17.071 --> 02:20.039
The bullet is lodged here,
right up against the bone.

02:20.074 --> 02:22.441
You need me to remind you
what happens if it moves?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.943
I feel a tickle?

02:23.978 --> 02:25.444
Try not feeling anything.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.379
From the waist down, anyway.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.047
Judging by the position of the bullet,

02:29.082 --> 02:31.283
I'd say the epidural veins are at risk.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.052
- Stop me if you've heard this.
- I've heard this.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.487
You need to consider the surgery.

02:35.523 --> 02:36.922
It's a high-risk procedure,

02:36.957 --> 02:38.424
but it's not as high a risk
as walking around

02:38.459 --> 02:40.225
with a sharp piece of metal
playing footsies

02:40.260 --> 02:42.928
- with your spinal cord.
- It's not my first foray

02:42.963 --> 02:44.930
into high-risk behavior, Doc.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.232
Four months ago,
I gave you a prescription.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.399
Two weeks worth of pain killers.

02:48.435 --> 02:49.467
You haven't refilled it.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.669
I don't like to wait in line.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.938
Why are you doing this?

02:52.973 --> 02:53.905
You lookin' to suffer?

02:53.941 --> 02:55.506
All those nerve clusters
in the vicinity...

02:55.542 --> 02:58.109
honestly, how are you walking right now?

02:58.145 --> 03:00.163
Like this.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.416
Well, it's a good thing
you can pull off a suit

03:05.452 --> 03:08.085
'cause we might be
making a late entrance.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.882
I don't think Nava's gonna mind.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.490
I'm doing a piece on his murder

03:12.525 --> 03:14.325
but things aren't quite adding up

03:14.361 --> 03:16.471
with Cesar Molina.

03:17.129 --> 03:20.965
- The dead suspect.
- Strange.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.033
You were always good in math.

03:23.069 --> 03:26.103
Cesar's father doesn't think
he killed Nava, Dad.

03:26.138 --> 03:27.323
Or that dock worker.

03:27.358 --> 03:28.705
Doesn't believe he was even anywhere

03:28.741 --> 03:30.374
near that neighborhood when it happened.

03:30.409 --> 03:32.108
He's playing you.

03:32.143 --> 03:33.309
He's reaching out to you

03:33.345 --> 03:34.611
so you'll reach out to me,

03:34.646 --> 03:36.613
once the investigation reopened.

03:36.648 --> 03:40.950
- I reached out to him.
- Fathers will do or say

03:40.986 --> 03:43.953
anything to protect their boys.

03:43.989 --> 03:46.043
Even in death.

03:47.158 --> 03:49.525
Life is a precious gift.

03:49.560 --> 03:53.342
Delicate and fleeting.

03:54.165 --> 03:57.637
When it's gone, we wish
for just one more moment of it,

03:59.170 --> 04:01.975
like waking up from a beautiful dream.

04:03.608 --> 04:06.438
When that dream is taken from us,

04:07.111 --> 04:11.414
we ache for one more chance

04:11.449 --> 04:14.082
to say the things we wanted to say

04:14.118 --> 04:16.519
to the person who deserved
to hear it most.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.523
James Nava awakened something in me

04:20.558 --> 04:22.829
that I had forgotten how to feel.

04:24.194 --> 04:25.957
It's a rare thing

04:26.797 --> 04:30.032
to have someone who...

04:33.203 --> 04:34.883
Someone who...

04:43.046 --> 04:45.143
James made me a better person.

04:46.215 --> 04:48.416
He made me laugh.

04:48.452 --> 04:51.191
He made me wanna build a world
as he saw it.

04:54.457 --> 04:56.947
Through his jobs, James saw humanity

04:58.161 --> 04:59.991
at its absolute worst

05:01.230 --> 05:03.829
and still believed in our infinite good.

05:07.503 --> 05:09.418
James couldn't help it.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.924
He didn't try to be noble.

05:19.648 --> 05:21.721
He just was.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.753
I will miss him every day.

05:34.196 --> 05:35.395
Scripture tells us,

05:35.430 --> 05:38.831
"Come, you who are blessed by my father.

05:38.867 --> 05:40.333
"Says the Lord,

05:40.369 --> 05:42.102
"inherit the kingdom

05:42.137 --> 05:45.738
"Prepared for you from the
foundation of the world.

05:45.773 --> 05:49.040
"For I was hungry and you gave me food.

05:50.378 --> 05:54.179
Listen to me, I need you to
stand tall right now.

05:54.215 --> 05:56.081
Can you do that?

05:56.117 --> 05:59.134
All right, good man. I'm on my way.

05:59.687 --> 06:01.906
Hey, new friends, Woz?

06:01.942 --> 06:04.256
I thought everyone you cared
about was inside

06:04.291 --> 06:07.493
Well, some people appreciate
my help more than others.

06:07.528 --> 06:08.982
Oh, man. She'll come around.

06:09.017 --> 06:11.163
She's just busy being
strong as hell right now.

06:11.198 --> 06:13.432
Do you still take orders from me?

06:13.467 --> 06:15.167
Till I'm in one of those boxes.

06:15.202 --> 06:17.368
Keep an eye on her.

06:17.404 --> 06:19.470
All right.

06:24.177 --> 06:26.678
Let's look at the bright side.

06:26.713 --> 06:29.581
You got me out of a funeral.

06:31.418 --> 06:33.317
You know I have your back.

06:33.353 --> 06:34.785
That's not why I called.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.488
What, you want me to smuggle
you out in my trunk?

06:37.524 --> 06:39.690
It's my mom. I think something's wrong.

06:39.725 --> 06:41.659
Hasn't she been by to see you?

06:41.694 --> 06:44.328
She visits on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays.

06:44.364 --> 06:47.465
But she missed Saturday
and when I called her back,

06:47.500 --> 06:50.233
she sounded like she wanted
to get off the phone.

06:50.269 --> 06:52.570
Well, I'm gonna stop by and check on her.

06:52.605 --> 06:54.538
You don't have to worry.

06:54.574 --> 06:58.909
Quince is not a problem
for either you or your mom

06:58.945 --> 07:00.695
ever again.

07:02.094 --> 07:04.628
They left me alone because
they thought I worked for him.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.244
- But now that he's gone...
- Look...

07:08.286 --> 07:11.521
you took down one badass cop.

07:11.623 --> 07:13.667
You keep your chin up,

07:14.192 --> 07:16.259
your shoulders back

07:16.462 --> 07:17.561
and I'm gonna come and visit you

07:17.596 --> 07:19.362
in a couple of days.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.799
Okay?

07:28.640 --> 07:29.606
- Ah!
- You even look

07:29.641 --> 07:31.048
in this kid's direction again,

07:31.084 --> 07:32.958
the next time this past head is shaved,

07:32.994 --> 07:34.543
I'm gonna be holding the razor.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.212
And I'm very twitchy.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.180
It wasn't me. I didn't even touch him.

07:38.216 --> 07:40.860
You make sure nobody does.

07:55.666 --> 07:57.365
She did good in there.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.045
I couldn't imagine.

07:59.803 --> 08:02.738
- I'll go pull the car up.
- Thanks.

08:03.841 --> 08:06.241
Your dad sure knows how to make an exit.

08:06.276 --> 08:08.243
Lots of practice.

08:08.278 --> 08:10.061
Easy, easy.

08:10.061 --> 08:12.995
Criminals don't work
around holidays or funerals.

08:13.031 --> 08:14.563
Yeah.

08:14.598 --> 08:17.355
- Terrible thing to happen.
- Mm-hmm.

08:18.069 --> 08:20.169
Hey, you need a ride to the cemetery?

08:20.204 --> 08:22.438
Hey, you know the guy that killed him?

08:22.473 --> 08:24.606
Cesar Molina?

08:24.642 --> 08:27.676
His dad talked about
how Cesar found God in prison.

08:27.711 --> 08:30.446
Did you guys run a profile on him?

08:30.481 --> 08:34.049
You know, Nate, I'm not sure
this is the right time now.

08:34.083 --> 08:36.351
Yeah, but do I have the right cop?

08:36.385 --> 08:38.587
To comment on an ex-con's
father peddling a story?

08:38.621 --> 08:40.355
If there is a story, shouldn't someone

08:40.390 --> 08:42.172
be willing to listen?

08:54.671 --> 08:57.472
I cannot wait to see my own bed.

08:57.507 --> 08:59.707
Maybe you should stay home tomorrow.

08:59.742 --> 09:01.309
Take another day.

09:01.345 --> 09:03.310
So I don't beat up
another cashmere troll?

09:05.582 --> 09:07.238
I will if you will.

09:08.485 --> 09:10.384
It's a deal.

09:10.419 --> 09:13.578
So did you see Uncle Woz
leave the funeral early?

09:14.290 --> 09:16.847
Yeah, he probably got
called away on a case.

09:16.883 --> 09:18.625
You guys aren't fighting?

09:20.363 --> 09:23.364
You barely looked at him.
It doesn't take a genius.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.601
Honey, I'm gonna need you
to go inside, okay?

09:27.636 --> 09:30.137
What? Why? Who is that?

09:30.172 --> 09:31.838
Work stuff, okay?

09:31.874 --> 09:33.598
I'll be right in.

09:39.214 --> 09:40.580
You should've called.

09:40.616 --> 09:42.415
I'm sorry. I didn't know where to go.

09:42.450 --> 09:44.083
I need some cash.
I need to leave town tonight.

09:44.119 --> 09:46.152
Okay, slow down.
Just tell me what happened.

09:46.187 --> 09:48.154
I was walking home
the night before I went inside.

09:48.189 --> 09:49.589
I saw him.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.157
Saw who?

09:51.726 --> 09:53.201
Stahl.

09:53.946 --> 09:55.528
I saw Stahl, too.

10:02.872 --> 10:03.837
Karen.

10:03.873 --> 10:05.972
Don't make me go to the car
and get my ram.

10:06.007 --> 10:07.740
Come on, open up.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.682
Look, I appreciate you visiting my son.

10:15.717 --> 10:19.186
But out here, police visits
that don't end in handcuffs

10:19.221 --> 10:21.054
end in body bags, man.

10:21.089 --> 10:24.156
You missed your visit on Saturday.

10:24.192 --> 10:27.159
Adrian is worried about you.

10:27.694 --> 10:30.697
I had a double shift packing produce.

10:31.072 --> 10:35.001
Your son shot me in the gut,
but I can still hear.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.786
I heard you cock the gun
that you're holding.

10:38.821 --> 10:41.221
Look, I'm just trying
to make it to next Saturday

10:41.257 --> 10:42.756
- so I can see my baby.
- Yeah.

10:42.792 --> 10:44.127
That's it.

10:45.294 --> 10:47.360
Hazard of the drug trade?

10:47.396 --> 10:49.396
No.

10:49.431 --> 10:52.465
I made a promise to Adrian and to myself.

10:52.501 --> 10:56.014
I see promises broken all day long.

10:56.505 --> 10:57.804
You really think I'ma
go back to that life

10:57.839 --> 10:59.639
after what they did to my boy?

10:59.675 --> 11:02.353
Then put the gun away and open the door.

11:18.626 --> 11:20.459
You always this hospitable?

11:20.494 --> 11:22.295
It's precautions.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.763
My roommate is missing.

11:24.799 --> 11:27.300
She left you to babysit?

11:27.335 --> 11:30.256
No, it was supposed to be
an overnight supply run.

11:30.838 --> 11:33.305
Shauna's been gone three days now.

11:33.341 --> 11:36.308
Your son is alone and scared

11:36.344 --> 11:39.678
and has seen more than any
nine-year-old should ever see.

11:39.714 --> 11:41.077
You don't think I know that?

11:41.112 --> 11:43.615
He shouldn't have to worry
if his mom's gonna show

11:43.651 --> 11:45.083
because she's out slinging dope.

11:45.118 --> 11:47.452
Yo, I told you.
I don't run for them no more.

11:47.487 --> 11:49.776
Well then, why all the precautions?

11:50.390 --> 11:52.924
Because they wanted me
for the transport job.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.625
But I passed.

11:54.661 --> 11:55.961
Shauna jumped on the fast cash

11:55.996 --> 11:58.496
so I made an introduction.

11:58.531 --> 12:00.245
Who we talking about?

12:01.468 --> 12:02.633
Eddy Dixon.

12:02.669 --> 12:05.770
- Quince's old crew.
- Yeah.

12:05.805 --> 12:08.088
And if she misses delivery,

12:08.089 --> 12:09.521
I'm on the hook.

12:09.557 --> 12:12.057
Agent Stahl didn't say anything to you?

12:12.093 --> 12:15.827
He might've called out my name.

12:15.862 --> 12:18.196
You wouldn't recognize his voice?

12:18.231 --> 12:21.199
By then I was already running.

12:23.369 --> 12:25.169
You've been meeting with her once a week.

12:25.205 --> 12:27.438
Hypermnesia. Repeated interviews

12:27.474 --> 12:29.574
increase detail recollection.

12:29.610 --> 12:32.210
And you pay her for these sessions.

12:32.245 --> 12:34.512
Doesn't make her information
any less valuable.

12:34.547 --> 12:35.713
It might.

12:35.748 --> 12:38.216
Either consciously or subconsciously.

12:38.251 --> 12:39.283
She wants to please you.

12:39.319 --> 12:40.551
Lying to the FBI is a felony.

12:40.587 --> 12:42.853
I doubt she wants to please me that much.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.223
Did you share with her your
belief that Agent Stahl

12:45.258 --> 12:47.391
is back in the city?

12:47.427 --> 12:50.193
You now have independent corroboration.

12:50.229 --> 12:53.230
Fear can have a powerful
influence on how we see things.

12:53.265 --> 12:55.599
And eyewitnesses should have
a powerful influence

12:55.635 --> 12:57.567
on the zip codes of your investigation.

12:57.603 --> 13:00.437
I understand you are
under a lot of stress.

13:00.472 --> 13:02.572
Letting this woman
stay in your home last night...

13:02.608 --> 13:04.374
I have to keep her here.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.409
Right? Stahl is in New York. Right now.

13:06.445 --> 13:08.612
I promise you, we're taking
this investigation seriously.

13:08.647 --> 13:10.213
Yeah, so where's the MTA footage

13:10.249 --> 13:11.348
of the night I saw Stahl on the subway?

13:11.383 --> 13:14.551
I told you, the IT Department
is retrieving the data.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.386
The video files were corrupted.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.456
I've been a detective for over a decade.

13:19.491 --> 13:21.124
I know when I'm being hustled.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.894
You're being hustled.
Just not by the Bureau.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.234
Thanks for the ride and the coffee.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.502
Hey, if your job's
half as boring as mine,

13:33.538 --> 13:34.603
you're gonna need it.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.305
Gotta say,

13:36.340 --> 13:37.774
I'm not loving these seat assignments.

13:37.809 --> 13:39.175
Sorry, little brother.

13:39.210 --> 13:40.342
I swore I'd never
end up back there again.

13:40.378 --> 13:42.444
You rather I make you walk
home after falling asleep

13:42.480 --> 13:44.780
- on my couch?
- Wallace, don't apologize.

13:44.815 --> 13:46.515
I like him right where he is.

13:46.551 --> 13:48.651
He can't monopolize the radio.

13:48.686 --> 13:50.619
Anything to be of service to the 64.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.154
Well, make sure you get

13:52.190 --> 13:53.355
to your parole officer meeting
ten minutes early.

13:53.391 --> 13:55.757
Tess, roll my window down.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.492
They notice stuff like that.

13:57.527 --> 13:59.627
Officer, could you please
ask your suspect

13:59.663 --> 14:01.429
if I can go to my actual job?

14:01.464 --> 14:04.265
Don't worry, I got him. Get out of here.

14:06.469 --> 14:07.703
- You didn't think I saw that?
- What?

14:07.738 --> 14:08.937
Off limits, Tess.

14:08.972 --> 14:10.371
All right, now let me out.

14:10.407 --> 14:11.606
Unlock the door, Tess.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.140
No, no.

14:13.176 --> 14:14.709
- Unlock the door, Tess.
- Did you say something?

14:14.744 --> 14:16.444
- Come on, Tess.
- Huh?

14:16.479 --> 14:19.214
So we have zero connects
to Quince's old crew.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.316
Four months is an eternity
on the streets.

14:21.351 --> 14:23.284
Well, while I'm fighting for my life,

14:23.320 --> 14:25.186
you let Brooklyn turn into
"Lord of the Flies."

14:25.222 --> 14:27.642
I had to give you a reason to come back.

14:28.425 --> 14:30.557
Or not. I'll, uh, I'll pull
the phone records

14:30.593 --> 14:32.392
on this missing woman.

14:32.428 --> 14:34.494
Loman, call around hospitals.

14:34.530 --> 14:36.630
See if they admitted a Shauna Davis

14:36.665 --> 14:39.399
or any Jane Doe, black, mid-20s.

14:39.435 --> 14:42.302
Shauna Davis, got it.
Listen, you got a sec?

14:42.338 --> 14:43.337
When you find my missing person.

14:43.372 --> 14:45.539
After the funeral,
Nate started asking questions

14:45.574 --> 14:47.541
about Nava's murder.

14:47.576 --> 14:49.309
Yeah, Nate's a reporter.

14:49.345 --> 14:50.510
Unfortunately, a pretty good one.

14:50.546 --> 14:54.314
He's kicking the tires on the
dead suspect, Cesar Molina.

14:54.350 --> 14:57.751
Nate's sole source
is one of 1,000 fathers

14:57.786 --> 15:00.654
who think that their
ex-con son is innocent.

15:00.689 --> 15:02.588
Well, this one is, Woz.

15:02.624 --> 15:04.523
And it's not only Nava who was killed.

15:04.559 --> 15:06.359
If he starts looking into Orlando,

15:06.394 --> 15:08.261
that thread could unravel
Harlee's bad shoot

15:08.296 --> 15:11.197
- at the Sunrise.
- And that leads to you.

15:11.233 --> 15:12.431
Do you want
the Intelligence Unit thinking

15:12.467 --> 15:13.833
you fed information to your son?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.701
- So did you lie to him?
- Well, yeah.

15:15.737 --> 15:18.151
Assured him that there's no story.

15:18.806 --> 15:20.736
Assured is a strong word.

15:21.376 --> 15:24.017
- On a scale of one to ten.
- On what?

15:24.053 --> 15:26.512
Nate's questioned multiple
police officers.

15:26.547 --> 15:28.681
What are the chances
that he leaves this alone?

15:28.716 --> 15:31.450
- A six?
- Eh, make it a four.

15:31.486 --> 15:33.416
So you know what to do.

15:33.921 --> 15:35.420
Go to the source.

15:35.455 --> 15:37.890
Well, you're not gonna
break my son's kneecaps.

15:37.925 --> 15:39.172
Yeah, okay.

15:47.734 --> 15:50.468
Maybe I should trade my cello
for a nine millimeter.

15:50.504 --> 15:52.470
Slow down, 007.

15:52.506 --> 15:53.871
We're just taking precautions.

15:53.907 --> 15:55.407
You remember how to load it?

15:55.442 --> 15:56.808
You act like it's my first time.

15:56.843 --> 16:00.151
So, um, how long is Gina staying?

16:00.814 --> 16:02.580
One more night.

16:02.616 --> 16:04.113
She's in some trouble.

16:04.685 --> 16:07.450
So Gina's in trouble
and we're at a gun range.

16:07.954 --> 16:10.387
No connection there, I'm sure.

16:10.423 --> 16:11.823
Look, the man who killed your father

16:11.858 --> 16:14.292
and then told you he was
a private investigator

16:14.327 --> 16:15.875
is back in town.

16:16.863 --> 16:18.395
I thought you said he would be stupid

16:18.431 --> 16:19.831
to come back to New York.

16:19.866 --> 16:22.934
Look, I can't guess what he's thinking.

16:22.969 --> 16:25.336
But if you see him, you don't hesitate.

16:25.371 --> 16:26.677
Just shoot.

16:32.131 --> 16:34.431
Feels heavier now, doesn't it.

16:34.780 --> 16:37.146
Yeah. A bit.

16:39.485 --> 16:41.784
But it's nice to know what's going on.

16:41.820 --> 16:43.753
One more time.

16:43.788 --> 16:47.907
And remember, let each shot
surprise you between breaths.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.119
- Empty the clip?
- Until he goes down.

17:09.513 --> 17:11.714
But soon, I'm gonna heal you.

17:26.659 --> 17:28.838
So what's so important
about this drug mule?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.848
She's been missing for 72 hours.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.584
Tufo said you ran
with Quince's crew in prison.

17:33.937 --> 17:35.170
You keep up with Eddy Dixon?

17:35.205 --> 17:36.672
Associating with known felons

17:36.707 --> 17:38.306
would be a violation
of my parole, officer.

17:38.342 --> 17:40.609
That's only if it makes the paperwork.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.678
Dixon's been in and out
of prison the last decade.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.012
We know y'all did time together.

17:44.047 --> 17:45.580
He recruited me on the inside.

17:45.615 --> 17:47.182
He got out last month.

17:47.217 --> 17:49.584
Real hustler. Always wanted
to be number one.

17:49.619 --> 17:50.752
You know where he conducts business?

17:50.787 --> 17:52.008
I could find out.

17:52.044 --> 17:54.689
Dixon always said
holler if I needed anything.

17:54.724 --> 17:57.592
Wallace, these grinders
don't work themselves.

17:57.627 --> 17:58.793
This ain't China.

17:58.828 --> 18:02.663
Wallace is still on break.

18:02.699 --> 18:04.331
Right.

18:04.367 --> 18:05.867
I could find that location,.

18:05.902 --> 18:07.802
Look, if you get a bad vibe,

18:07.837 --> 18:10.170
you clam up, you walk away.

18:10.206 --> 18:13.040
Your gut is your best warning system.

18:13.075 --> 18:15.175
Right about now, it's saying
don't tell my brother.

18:15.211 --> 18:19.046
Well, arrangements like this
are strictly confidential.

18:19.081 --> 18:21.315
I'll hit you up when I know something.

18:23.886 --> 18:25.819
It's a bad idea.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.721
Tufo's playing helicopter mom

18:27.756 --> 18:28.907
to keep Wallace out of that life.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.725
Wallace wants to help
find this young mother.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.860
Who am I to deny purpose?

18:33.896 --> 18:35.695
His brother's boss.

18:35.731 --> 18:37.350
Come on.

18:38.099 --> 18:40.734
I've dealt with a lot of messed up johns.

18:40.769 --> 18:43.105
Some weird stuff.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.672
I've never met anyone with such...

18:45.707 --> 18:48.675
- Darkness?
- Scariest part was

18:48.710 --> 18:51.144
how he could hide it
with that boy scout look.

18:53.281 --> 18:55.348
Not anymore.

19:01.756 --> 19:03.542
Harlee Santos?

19:20.140 --> 19:22.007
Well, look who's big time now,

19:22.042 --> 19:24.176
- calling for a patrol car.
- Don't get used to it.

19:24.211 --> 19:26.111
- We work for the taxpayers.
- Yeah?

19:26.146 --> 19:28.025
Good thing I pay my taxes.

19:32.319 --> 19:34.782
Need some privacy to question a witness.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.734
Thomas Molina?

19:49.769 --> 19:51.590
Who's askin'?

19:52.105 --> 19:54.038
Did you contact a Nate Wozniak,

19:54.073 --> 19:56.374
reporter for the "New York Ledger"?

19:58.011 --> 20:02.226
Hey, register's open!
Just take whatever you want!

20:03.316 --> 20:04.315
We don't want your money.

20:04.350 --> 20:06.689
Or my wine, apparently.

20:08.854 --> 20:12.322
Grand theft auto,
grand larceny, armed robbery.

20:12.357 --> 20:15.114
You, my friend,
need a better getaway driver.

20:15.861 --> 20:17.127
Your son, too.

20:19.698 --> 20:21.331
I paid my debt.

20:21.366 --> 20:23.466
And my son paid with his life.

20:23.502 --> 20:25.736
He had just been released from prison.

20:25.771 --> 20:28.071
Right?

20:28.106 --> 20:30.306
- Mr. Molina?
- I-I couldn't

20:30.342 --> 20:32.308
recognize him in a good way.

20:32.344 --> 20:34.010
He changed when he was inside.

20:34.046 --> 20:37.013
He found a higher power
that he could respect.

20:37.049 --> 20:38.915
This is his...

20:38.950 --> 20:40.181
Oh...

20:41.853 --> 20:43.642
This was his.

20:44.722 --> 20:47.823
He was already leading
a Bible study for parolees.

20:47.859 --> 20:50.860
My boy didn't kill those men.

20:50.895 --> 20:54.096
And he sure as hell didn't kill himself.

20:58.870 --> 21:00.836
I get it.

21:00.872 --> 21:03.205
You wanna protect your son's memory.

21:03.240 --> 21:04.306
I mean, any father in your position

21:04.341 --> 21:06.375
would wanna do the same.

21:06.410 --> 21:09.144
And with a rap sheet like yours,

21:09.180 --> 21:12.214
well, assault on a police
officer could land you

21:12.249 --> 21:15.984
back in prison.

21:17.168 --> 21:19.854
Well, with the week that I've just had,

21:19.890 --> 21:20.889
it's still tempting.

21:20.924 --> 21:24.391
Don't contact Nate Wozniak.

21:24.928 --> 21:27.353
If he calls you, don't answer.

21:27.898 --> 21:32.000
If he won't let it go, change your story.

21:42.778 --> 21:44.312
Damn, man. You really channeled

21:44.347 --> 21:45.879
Michael Corleone in there.

21:45.915 --> 21:47.881
I didn't know you had it in you.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.751
Yes, you did.

21:50.786 --> 21:53.887
- Y'all made sure of it.
- Oh, Loman, I know it sucks.

21:53.923 --> 21:56.023
But you just protected us all.
Especially Harlee.

21:56.058 --> 21:57.357
You should be proud of yourself.

21:57.392 --> 22:00.291
I just bullied a grieving father, Tess.

22:00.326 --> 22:02.888
I'm not proud of anything.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.200
Nothing intercepted from DEA or Homeland.

22:07.236 --> 22:09.902
No arrests under the name Shauna Davis.

22:09.938 --> 22:11.438
You think she took the money and ran?

22:11.473 --> 22:13.840
What? With a baby waiting at home?

22:15.310 --> 22:17.377
It's possible. I really don't remember.

22:17.412 --> 22:18.945
But this could be him.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.913
You know how many customers I see a week?

22:20.949 --> 22:21.981
That pay in cash and didn't give a name.

22:22.017 --> 22:25.051
More common than you think.

22:27.088 --> 22:28.330
Excuse me.

22:30.324 --> 22:33.092
- What?
- What are... you working a case?

22:33.128 --> 22:34.296
No. Following a lead.

22:34.332 --> 22:36.062
Is that how you take a personal day?

22:36.097 --> 22:38.931
Somebody sent me flowers.
No card, paid cash.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.233
A flower stand in Bed-Stuy
with no video security.

22:41.269 --> 22:42.934
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?

22:42.970 --> 22:45.304
I'll hold down the florist,
you grab a phonebook.

22:45.339 --> 22:46.938
I'd settle for no interruptions.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.607
- You worried it's Stahl?
- Don't say that

22:48.643 --> 22:49.975
like I'm crazy.

22:50.010 --> 22:52.211
I think a little crazy is normal.

22:52.246 --> 22:54.440
This is how Stahl operates.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.315
All right? He feeds off your fears

22:56.350 --> 22:58.416
and then he holds on like a vulture.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.530
I sent the flowers.

23:03.323 --> 23:06.201
I didn't know what to say on the card.

23:07.194 --> 23:09.294
Your name might've helped.

23:09.329 --> 23:11.629
Is it possible that maybe
you're using Stahl

23:11.665 --> 23:13.165
as a distraction?

23:13.200 --> 23:14.499
What, a distraction from the fact

23:14.534 --> 23:16.967
that I stood by while
the Intelligence Unit

23:17.003 --> 23:19.131
killed the only decent man
that I ever loved?

23:20.272 --> 23:22.506
Or that you helped cover their tracks?

23:22.541 --> 23:24.053
See?

23:24.543 --> 23:26.722
Hard to put on a card.

23:31.050 --> 23:33.617
We cleared it up. You're free to go.

23:38.056 --> 23:41.191
You're not crazy,
you're just overwhelmed.

23:41.227 --> 23:42.459
And now I'm on my way to Jersey

23:42.494 --> 23:44.027
to comb through a hooker's apartment

23:44.062 --> 23:45.662
in search of a psychopath.

23:45.698 --> 23:49.199
Harlee, listen, you know deep down

23:49.235 --> 23:52.969
what I did for you, you'd do
the same thing for Cristina.

23:53.004 --> 23:54.170
The same way that you know that

23:54.206 --> 23:58.712
to be free of Stahl, you have
to stop chasing his ghost.

23:59.211 --> 24:02.645
It's up to you how much more
you wanna sacrifice.

24:07.585 --> 24:09.181
What kinda flowers?

24:14.392 --> 24:15.524
What?

24:15.560 --> 24:17.526
What kinda flowers did you send?

24:17.562 --> 24:19.228
I let them choose.

24:27.836 --> 24:29.269
At what point do we call backup?

24:30.536 --> 24:32.486
What'd you leave your balls
in the precinct?

24:32.521 --> 24:34.081
We're picking up a girl.

24:35.024 --> 24:37.457
Damn, y'all got here quick.

24:37.493 --> 24:39.560
You said you had timely information.

24:39.595 --> 24:42.596
Right. You see that beauty
salon across the street?

24:42.631 --> 24:44.731
That's where Dixon takes his drug mules.

24:44.766 --> 24:46.567
Normal supply chain
got cut off or something,

24:46.602 --> 24:47.801
so he started improvising.

24:47.836 --> 24:49.002
Take a look around?

24:49.037 --> 24:50.970
It's shut down today for a reason.

24:51.006 --> 24:52.906
I overheard Dixon on a call.
Something went wrong.

24:52.941 --> 24:54.941
- Shauna?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:54.976 --> 24:57.729
And he sounded pissed
when he mentioned this place.

24:58.780 --> 25:02.481
Wallace, are you high?

25:02.517 --> 25:04.918
Come on, man! What the hell
is wrong with you?

25:04.953 --> 25:06.753
You over here partying while
some girl's life is in danger.

25:06.788 --> 25:09.655
With Dixon. I had to gain his trust.

25:09.691 --> 25:12.826
You think he was gonna slip up
about his drug operation sober?

25:12.861 --> 25:14.594
What went wrong with the girl?

25:14.629 --> 25:17.463
He didn't say. You asked for a location.

25:17.498 --> 25:18.764
There it is.

25:23.638 --> 25:26.505
Police. Open up.

25:30.545 --> 25:32.511
We're closed for the day. Uh!

25:32.547 --> 25:34.679
Open the gate.
We're not here for a facial.

25:34.715 --> 25:35.848
Who else is in here?

25:35.883 --> 25:37.983
No one, I promise.

25:39.754 --> 25:41.820
Step aside.

25:44.658 --> 25:46.792
It's all clear here, boss.

25:46.827 --> 25:49.072
Ahh!

25:52.165 --> 25:53.865
Where's the girl?

25:53.900 --> 25:55.567
Room four.

26:05.679 --> 26:07.245
Police.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.384
If I let go, she'll bleed out.

26:11.684 --> 26:13.084
She swallowed all of these?

26:13.119 --> 26:15.086
She was impacted. I told them I couldn't

26:15.121 --> 26:17.554
safely extract the drugs,
but one of the bags ruptured.

26:17.590 --> 26:19.723
She was ODing.

26:22.095 --> 26:24.027
- Mom?
- It's just me.

26:24.062 --> 26:25.776
Your mom's not home yet.

26:27.032 --> 26:30.267
- Are those my clothes?
- Yeah.

26:30.303 --> 26:31.868
I saw you had some laundry in the dryer.

26:31.904 --> 26:34.137
I figured I'd help out wherever I can.

26:35.608 --> 26:37.608
While you're at it,
do you wanna clean my room?

26:37.643 --> 26:39.676
Yeah, careful.

26:39.711 --> 26:41.011
I didn't clean my room as a teenager,

26:41.046 --> 26:42.112
and look where that got me.

26:42.147 --> 26:43.752
Yeah? Where's that?

26:44.516 --> 26:46.516
Hotel hospitality.

26:49.587 --> 26:50.854
How do you know my mom again?

26:50.889 --> 26:55.305
We, um, share a common admirer.

26:59.931 --> 27:02.832
Yeah, he's so unpredictable.

27:04.168 --> 27:06.302
It's a good thing you're here.

27:06.338 --> 27:07.870
Well, that butcher did something right.

27:07.905 --> 27:09.639
He gave her Narcan to counter the effect

27:09.674 --> 27:10.973
of the ruptured bag of heroin
in her stomach.

27:11.008 --> 27:13.142
Well, you'd expect a drug
smuggler's doctor

27:13.177 --> 27:14.944
to have plenty of that on hand.

27:14.979 --> 27:16.745
Blood pressure's dropping.
She's going into shock.

27:16.780 --> 27:18.245
We gotta roll.

27:23.754 --> 27:25.654
Street value of a quarter million.

27:25.689 --> 27:27.890
There's no way Quince's
old muscle's bankrolling

27:27.925 --> 27:29.624
a smuggling operation like this
on their own.

27:29.660 --> 27:32.627
Ooh, one of us has gotta
give Wallace a ride home.

27:32.663 --> 27:34.062
Look, I'll drive. You tell Tufo.

27:34.097 --> 27:35.296
Ah, there's nothing to tell.

27:35.332 --> 27:39.735
We found a mystery supplier,
Wallace saved the girl's life

27:39.770 --> 27:41.603
Two more hours
and she wouldn't have made it.

27:41.638 --> 27:44.105
Great. Then you go tell Tufo
his brother's a hero.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.074
Hey, Wallace.

27:46.109 --> 27:48.076
Your car service is here.

27:48.111 --> 27:50.245
Damn. I forgot my PO meeting today.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.347
I'll handle it.

27:52.382 --> 27:55.250
You go home, make sure
your brother doesn't see you

27:55.285 --> 27:56.817
until you come down.

27:56.853 --> 27:58.253
Come on. Let's go, Rick James.

27:59.956 --> 28:02.022
Hey, Wallace.

28:02.057 --> 28:04.124
You did a good job.

28:09.131 --> 28:10.264
Is it here?

28:10.299 --> 28:11.932
The Bureau sent a secure link.

28:11.967 --> 28:13.200
You need to log into the FBI mainframe

28:13.235 --> 28:14.769
for the MTA security footage.

28:14.804 --> 28:15.736
Can you take this to the lab for me?

28:15.772 --> 28:17.271
Tell them to cross check
for Robert Stahl.

28:17.306 --> 28:18.764
He's in the system.

28:19.308 --> 28:20.974
You got a fingerprint?

28:21.010 --> 28:22.976
Yeah, off of a reformed
prostitute's intercom button.

28:23.012 --> 28:24.677
- We'll see.
- Agent Myers' assistant

28:24.713 --> 28:26.380
also told me to tell you she's sorry.

28:26.415 --> 28:29.149
Any reason why
the FBI's apologizing to us?

28:35.023 --> 28:36.357
Okay.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.131
It's not him.

28:55.843 --> 28:56.976
You were kidnapped?

28:57.011 --> 29:00.055
Kidnapped. Held hostage in the woods.

29:00.714 --> 29:02.982
That's an important detail,
don't you think?

29:07.688 --> 29:09.321
I told you we set up a sting.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.056
- Do you remember that?
- You didn't tell me

29:11.091 --> 29:13.425
that he drugged you and tied you up.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.160
I said he got the upper hand.

29:15.195 --> 29:17.663
You know, I thought
we were making progress,

29:17.698 --> 29:19.164
that you were being honest with me.

29:19.199 --> 29:20.293
But you started lying to me

29:20.328 --> 29:21.733
while you were still
in the hospital, Mom.

29:21.769 --> 29:23.268
I didn't lie.

29:23.303 --> 29:26.338
Okay, I just... I didn't share details

29:26.373 --> 29:28.006
- that you didn't need to know.
- Let me guess,

29:28.041 --> 29:29.097
you were protecting me, right?

29:29.132 --> 29:30.897
As a matter of fact, yes.

29:30.932 --> 29:33.379
That's your answer for everything, Mom.

29:33.404 --> 29:35.404
- And my job.
- No!

29:35.439 --> 29:37.073
Your job is to be honest with me.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.575
I'm not your girlfriend, Cristina.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.310
Okay, you're my daughter.

29:41.345 --> 29:43.512
And one day, when you're lucky
enough to have a child,

29:43.547 --> 29:45.414
you'll realize that
part of being a mother

29:45.449 --> 29:48.516
is not burdening them with your problems.

29:48.551 --> 29:50.897
Our problems.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.887
They're our problems, Mom.

29:53.923 --> 29:56.657
But instead of being straight
with me so I can support you,

29:56.692 --> 29:58.826
I had to find out from a stranger.

29:58.861 --> 30:00.949
What do you wanna hear, Cristina?

30:01.598 --> 30:04.665
You wanna hear how this psycho
is obsessed with me?

30:04.700 --> 30:07.534
How he stalked me? How he
stalked my teenage daughter?

30:07.569 --> 30:09.536
He invaded my life.

30:09.571 --> 30:12.006
Tied me and gagged me and dressed me up.

30:12.041 --> 30:14.541
You wanna hear how he was gonna
rape and kill me

30:14.576 --> 30:16.910
out in those woods if I hadn't
slit my own wrists?

30:16.946 --> 30:18.112
Is that what you wanna hear?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.426
Help me!

31:03.791 --> 31:05.263
Help me!

31:07.861 --> 31:09.928
Somebody!

31:14.862 --> 31:15.961
Nate.

31:15.996 --> 31:17.262
What are you doing?

31:17.297 --> 31:18.764
Changing a tire.

31:18.965 --> 31:20.907
- Take it down.
- It's Mom's orders.

31:20.932 --> 31:23.065
- She would've asked me.
- She did. Two weeks ago.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.801
She decided she was ready to
move on from that eyesore, Dad.

31:25.836 --> 31:26.868
It's a reminder.

31:26.903 --> 31:30.238
Of what? The mess that seems
to follow you around?

31:30.273 --> 31:32.832
Of why I do what I do.

31:33.944 --> 31:35.811
Forgive me if it gets old,
standing in the path

31:35.846 --> 31:37.746
of the hurricane, Dad.

31:37.781 --> 31:40.915
The dead suspect's father
retracted his statement.

31:40.951 --> 31:42.250
Yeah, my follow up calls

31:42.285 --> 31:44.252
are going straight to voicemail.

31:44.287 --> 31:46.120
Funny how you're not surprised
about that, though.

31:46.156 --> 31:49.790
Not everyone enjoys
talking to a reporter, Nate.

31:49.826 --> 31:50.925
Even a good one.

31:50.961 --> 31:52.660
I know you did this.

31:52.695 --> 31:54.762
God forbid, the NYPD

31:54.797 --> 31:56.097
should wanna take
a second look at something.

31:56.132 --> 31:57.698
Second looks are for people

31:57.734 --> 31:59.199
who don't do it right the first time.

31:59.235 --> 32:00.934
Yeah, you think
you're doing everything right.

32:00.970 --> 32:03.303
You won't even really admit who you are.

32:09.746 --> 32:12.680
Put my tools back where you found them.

32:13.916 --> 32:15.005
There was a story here, Dad.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.783
I just wish you woulda helped me tell it.

32:16.818 --> 32:19.953
There'll be another story tomorrow.

32:19.989 --> 32:21.021
At least you got your whole crew

32:21.056 --> 32:22.722
toeing the line this time, huh?

32:22.758 --> 32:24.824
You corrupt everybody
that comes this close to you?

32:24.860 --> 32:28.638
You know why I keep
these bullet holes untouched?

32:29.265 --> 32:33.768
Because it reminds me of how
close I came to losing you.

32:34.436 --> 32:36.035
I look at it every day.

32:36.070 --> 32:38.204
And I make the same promise that I made

32:38.239 --> 32:40.707
when I first held you in my arms.

32:40.742 --> 32:42.277
To keep you safe.

32:44.012 --> 32:47.213
I failed at a few promises.

32:47.248 --> 32:49.617
But that one I intend to keep.

32:52.287 --> 32:55.888
From the highest shelf
there is, Chicken Little.

32:55.924 --> 32:57.723
Take a breath, man.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.858
No, top shelf is a waste of money.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.727
- I'm angry drinking.
- Ooh!

33:01.762 --> 33:02.895
What's her name?

33:02.930 --> 33:05.864
Wallace. My brother missed
his parole meeting today.

33:05.900 --> 33:09.167
- Rescheduled.
- Mm-mm. Same difference.

33:09.202 --> 33:11.202
To a PO, it's strike one.

33:11.238 --> 33:13.071
Whoa, whoa, you think he's
dipping a toe in his past life?

33:13.106 --> 33:14.072
I don't know.

33:14.107 --> 33:16.875
But I won't let him
go down that road again.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.677
Maybe the train was delayed.
It's Brooklyn.

33:18.712 --> 33:19.710
No, I should've driven him myself.

33:19.746 --> 33:23.714
Complements of the brunette
in the corner booth.

33:25.785 --> 33:26.884
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.032
Now'd be a good time to explain.

33:35.688 --> 33:37.555
Pull up a chair.

33:37.797 --> 33:40.293
I have a seat already, thanks.

33:41.935 --> 33:44.769
Now wouldn't you prefer diners to bars?

33:44.804 --> 33:46.771
We felt you deserved a thank you

33:46.806 --> 33:48.305
for tying up loose ends.

33:48.341 --> 33:50.240
Your bill's been taken care of.

33:50.276 --> 33:52.536
- Loose ends?
- Tomas Molina.

33:52.571 --> 33:54.478
The liquor store owner.

33:54.513 --> 33:56.442
That's effective intimidation.

33:56.477 --> 33:59.249
Wozniak made a deal with your boss.

33:59.285 --> 34:01.085
You can stop following me.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.887
I respect a man who doesn't need to brag.

34:03.922 --> 34:05.089
You're talented.

34:05.124 --> 34:07.924
The way you snapped into action
and covered up that shooting

34:07.960 --> 34:09.324
- at the Sunrise.
- Face it, Michael.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.893
You're a natural.

34:10.929 --> 34:13.262
- We like naturals.
- You're smart.

34:13.297 --> 34:14.494
You deserve more.

34:15.601 --> 34:17.635
I'm good where I'm at.

34:19.036 --> 34:21.004
Thanks for the drinks, though.

34:21.039 --> 34:23.002
Don't fight your ambition, detective.

34:24.309 --> 34:26.089
It'll give you headaches.

34:29.981 --> 34:32.081
Making new friends?

34:32.117 --> 34:34.750
- I handled it.
- Oh, you handled it.

34:34.784 --> 34:35.951
Is that what you do now?

34:35.987 --> 34:37.920
Woz, come on. We need backup.

34:37.955 --> 34:39.351
Start without me.

34:40.558 --> 34:43.458
I got something I need to handle.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.492
I'm gonna ask you a question
and I want a straight answer.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.592
Why did my son come to you?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.760
- What?
- At the funeral.

34:57.796 --> 35:01.664
Why you, Loman?
Why did my son come to you?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.200
- Woz, you had left.
- He'd already talked to me.

35:04.235 --> 35:07.603
You were there, surrounded by
all the people

35:07.638 --> 35:09.505
who've known him
since he was a little kid.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.674
And yet he came to you.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.476
What made him think he could
get secrets out of you?

35:14.512 --> 35:16.778
I was straight with him last time.

35:16.814 --> 35:19.948
Last fall, when he was writing
that piece on Julia Ayers.

35:19.983 --> 35:22.618
And you shared what with him, exactly?

35:22.653 --> 35:25.221
Finer points of police work?

35:25.256 --> 35:27.789
How I run my crew?

35:27.825 --> 35:29.891
Your son knows who you are.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.571
It's no secret.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.241
What's no secret?

35:35.933 --> 35:38.286
- You know.
- No, I don't know.

35:39.069 --> 35:40.622
You tell me.

35:42.072 --> 35:43.972
That you can be a hard-nosed
son of a bitch

35:44.007 --> 35:46.085
when it comes to getting results.

35:48.545 --> 35:51.812
Did you tell him anything
about Donnie Pomp?

35:53.850 --> 35:57.885
I told him I got grilled
by an Internal Affairs officer

35:57.920 --> 36:00.391
that you didn't tell me was your friend.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.519
I don't remember you asking.

36:06.729 --> 36:10.568
I told him that I killed him
in your kitchen.

36:11.934 --> 36:15.490
And that you protected me
by burning the body.

36:16.572 --> 36:17.938
Why would you tell him that?

36:17.974 --> 36:20.495
Because not all of us
can carry around this...

36:21.143 --> 36:24.999
madness like you can, all right?

36:26.148 --> 36:29.587
Sometimes the truth just crawls out.

36:37.659 --> 36:40.682
Next time you feel like confessing,

36:42.330 --> 36:45.019
you find a priest.

37:23.771 --> 37:25.837
What are you doing in here?

37:25.873 --> 37:28.740
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

37:28.776 --> 37:31.943
What? Go through my stuff,
try on my clothes?

37:31.979 --> 37:34.379
I... I didn't bring any clothes. Sorry.

37:34.414 --> 37:37.149
I should've asked
before borrowing anything.

37:38.752 --> 37:40.185
Maybe you should go back to your place.

37:40.220 --> 37:43.221
No, please, I...

37:43.256 --> 37:46.058
I'm sorry, I just...

37:46.093 --> 37:47.959
After pretending to be you for so long,

37:47.995 --> 37:51.262
and... and seeing how obsessed
Stahl was with you,

37:51.298 --> 37:55.486
I guess I... I was curious
or... or jealous.

37:55.522 --> 37:56.634
I don't know, I just...

37:56.670 --> 37:58.718
I needed to know what it was like.

37:59.172 --> 38:01.239
Okay. You need to go.

38:01.274 --> 38:02.907
Harlee, please.

38:02.942 --> 38:05.309
I promise, it won't happen again.

38:05.344 --> 38:07.411
I know, because you're gonna
get out of my house

38:07.446 --> 38:09.246
right now.

38:09.281 --> 38:11.082
He'll come after me.

38:11.117 --> 38:13.191
You know that.

38:28.467 --> 38:30.267
What's your drink?

38:30.302 --> 38:32.168
You got any Drano back there?

38:32.204 --> 38:34.304
Close enough.

38:37.876 --> 38:39.943
You're not drinking that for the taste.

38:39.978 --> 38:42.112
A friendly ear beats 80-proof Drano.

38:43.982 --> 38:46.582
Don't get too close to me.

38:46.618 --> 38:50.120
Anybody who gets too close gets hurt.

38:50.155 --> 38:53.289
They get hurt, I end up here,

38:53.324 --> 38:55.090
trying to forget.

38:55.126 --> 38:58.294
I know a better way to forget.

39:05.370 --> 39:06.869
All business tonight, huh?

39:06.904 --> 39:09.138
- Don't talk.
- Relax.

39:09.173 --> 39:10.998
I won't bite.

39:11.876 --> 39:13.626
What's your problem?

39:14.845 --> 39:18.147
Why would I wanna be touched by some

39:18.182 --> 39:22.517
- Williamsburg hipster fairy?
- Let me go!

39:25.990 --> 39:27.723
You son of a bitch.

39:28.425 --> 39:30.124
You're dead.

39:45.909 --> 39:47.875
You should've run.

39:47.911 --> 39:50.077
You don't know me very well.

39:55.384 --> 39:58.853
Ahh! Ohh!

39:58.888 --> 40:02.717
Ah! Ohh!

40:07.563 --> 40:09.530
I'm not gonna steal anything.

40:09.565 --> 40:11.164
Did you ever really see him?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.433
I wouldn't lie to you.

40:12.468 --> 40:14.312
But you're not sure.

40:15.438 --> 40:17.440
I thought I was.

41:44.189 --> 41:45.111
No.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.115
No more.
