WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:02.812
- Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.238
We are not free.

00:04.272 --> 00:06.074
Even when they unlock
the door to this prison,

00:06.107 --> 00:07.408
we are still prisoners.

00:07.441 --> 00:08.676
- Is it okay if I listen?

00:08.709 --> 00:10.144
- What's your book
got to say about

00:10.178 --> 00:11.612
what's happening in America?

00:11.645 --> 00:14.215
- I'm in here because
I stood up for people.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.516
Outside of our Movement.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.351
People whose water
was being poisoned.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.686
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.421
Can you look at my baby?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.623
- Go back to the van and get her
some more water, okay?

00:22.656 --> 00:25.593
- I love our life,
I love this house.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.428
But we can have more.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.563
- Now that I'm becoming
a father, I have needs

00:29.597 --> 00:31.765
for my individual family.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.700
- Like?

00:32.732 --> 00:34.435
- A new refrigerator
for the guest house.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.736
- I am so sorry, Eddie.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.844
The stuff that Dekaan
puts in that water

00:43.877 --> 00:45.579
isn't gonna show up
on your average tests.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.780
- Can you find it?
- Yeah.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.316
But it's not cheap.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.151
Libby Dekaan
had my son arrested.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.520
I have to pull the funding
for the water testing.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.222
- Don't need to have
the water tested.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.657
I know what's in
the fuckin' water.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.126
That's not what
blood looks like.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.060
That's poison.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.301 --> 01:42.336
I want to be clean again.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.778
I want to be purified.

02:40.428 --> 02:43.697
Are you fucking crazy?

03:25.339 --> 03:27.675
Okay, do you want to
run through it again?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.678
You don't have to, okay?

03:30.711 --> 03:31.745
Fine.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.514
- Uh, no, no, let's do it.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.915
- All right, all right, hit it.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.818
- So there is Alexa...
- Yes.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.653
- Who's a newscaster
from Phoenix.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.854
- Right

03:40.888 --> 03:42.456
- Um, and then there
are the Chrises,

03:42.490 --> 03:43.991
Chris X, T, B, and S.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.794
- Yes, the final four
are all Chrises this year.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.796
It's never happened before.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.399
- I cannot believe
how stupid this show is.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.501
- I know, it's so dumb.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.337
But if you can talk
"The Bachelorette,"

03:56.370 --> 03:59.807
you can get through this
or any barbeque.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.511
And, not to mention,
my cousin's wedding coming up.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.447
Wink, wink.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.316
Just sayin'.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.285
Uh, this is actually it
right here, on the left.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.495
We don't have to go in.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.397
If you think it's too much.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.602
No, it's...
It's gonna be fine.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.636
I want to.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.817
- I'm moving into the city.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.586
I don't want to talk about it.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.755
I've already decided.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.956
It's a done thing.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.359
Um...

04:51.392 --> 04:52.393
don't be mad.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.895
- I'm not mad.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.333
When did you decide this?

04:59.367 --> 05:01.034
- In jail.
- Juvenile detention.

05:02.370 --> 05:06.540
There is so much need...

05:06.574 --> 05:08.409
and injustice in this world,

05:08.442 --> 05:10.978
and I'm just sitting here,

05:11.011 --> 05:13.381
in this big,
warm comfortable house...

05:13.414 --> 05:15.849
- We live simply,
according to our values.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.685
The fact there are
a few comforts here...

05:17.718 --> 05:19.687
- No, I need to do the work.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.655
Not just learn about it,
pray about it...

05:21.689 --> 05:23.724
- I'm glad you feel
that way, Hawk.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.826
I felt exactly the same way
when I was your age.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.761
- And you got to do it.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.530
You got to help
build something new.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.840
That's what
the city center is now,

05:30.864 --> 05:32.500
and I want to be a part of it.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.378
- Can I just say that we are
doing important work

05:34.402 --> 05:35.569
at the compound, too?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.571
- Like the water project
in Clarksville?

05:37.605 --> 05:39.148
That was outside the scope
of our Movement.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.609
- No, you just didn't
want me locked up.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.011
- What's wrong with that?
- Sometimes there's a price.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.946
And you have to be willing
to pay it.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.583
I mean, what's your Vision, Mom?

05:49.617 --> 05:51.861
Where do you see The Light
taking us in the years to come?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.663
- I'm doing the work
that Steve wants me to do.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.556
- Steve's gone!

05:55.589 --> 05:59.793
He wrote "The Ladder" in the
'70s... the world has changed.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.395
- What is this?

06:04.498 --> 06:06.734
- I have to get my bus.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.624
- Oh, it is so good
to see Chloe.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.060
I haven't caught up
with her in forever.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.128
- Mm.
- She seems...

06:35.162 --> 06:36.564
happy.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.131
Really happy.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.634
Even if she doesn't give you
credit for that, I do.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.805
Kidding... she gave you
all the credit.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.474
- Well, no...

06:46.507 --> 06:48.141
no need to give any credit.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.877
- Come on,
there's always credit.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.750
- And if there's not,
make some up and take it.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.915
I'm rattlin'.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.660
Baby, you mind getting us
another round from the cooler?

06:56.684 --> 06:57.684
Eddie?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.121
Eddie?

07:01.154 --> 07:02.656
Beer?

07:02.690 --> 07:05.092
- Uh, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.795
If my dad were still alive to
see PBR be a "cool beer,"

07:07.828 --> 07:09.797
it would've killed him
faster than the cancer did.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.867
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.636
- So tell us everything
about yourself.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.870
Where ya from, what do you do?

07:16.904 --> 07:18.138
Ever been married?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.840
- Um...

07:23.076 --> 07:25.646
Are you guys watching
"The Bachelorette"?

07:25.679 --> 07:26.847
- Of course.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.583
- I hate it,
but Chris is gonna win.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.933
- Come in.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.201
Hey.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.803
What're you doing here
on a Sunday?

07:49.837 --> 07:52.105
Everything okay?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.974
- Yeah, uh...

07:54.007 --> 07:56.644
uh, I... I was hoping...

07:56.677 --> 07:57.954
I know I should've said
something in advance.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.780
- No, no, hey.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.716
What?
What is it?

08:02.750 --> 08:05.719
- I want to continue my climb.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.521
Here.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.822
In the city.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.693
- What'd your mom say about it?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.695
- She gets it.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.930
Or... or she will.

08:16.964 --> 08:17.998
Eventually.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.567
- Ah, she can't be, uh...

08:19.600 --> 08:21.134
happy to see you go.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.036
- Is her happiness
the most important thing?

08:23.070 --> 08:26.073
I mean, I don't remember...

08:26.106 --> 08:29.810
her being happy being
a rung on The Ladder.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.912
- Well, her happiness
is important to me

08:31.945 --> 08:34.582
and it is important to you.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.317
So I will just talk to her

08:37.350 --> 08:39.318
uh, at this afternoon's
security meeting

08:39.352 --> 08:42.322
and, uh, confirm that
this is what's best.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.214
- My God, I was so happy
to get your text.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.850
- I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.125
- I had to ditch a barbeque.
- I'm sorry.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.694
- Don't be, I was...
- I was having a panic attack,

09:20.728 --> 09:22.329
discussing "The Bachelorette."

09:22.362 --> 09:24.282
- Who's "The Bachelorette"?
- It does not matter.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.645
- I still can't believe it.
- I mean, Shelby?

09:37.678 --> 09:40.614
I feel so betrayed.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.619
- Did you hear she was working
with Eddie Lane?

09:45.653 --> 09:47.821
- Eddie Lane wasn't a traitor.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.657
He stopped believing.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.690
Come on.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.227
Good afternoon, everyone.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.065
I know that we are all
still reeling from the news

09:58.098 --> 10:01.334
that Shelby was, uh...

10:01.368 --> 10:03.270
trying to hurt us.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.173
We all loved and trusted her.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.242
I was a regular attendee
of her group,

10:09.276 --> 10:12.379
so, um...

10:12.412 --> 10:14.848
this hits especially hard.

10:14.882 --> 10:18.852
Uh, fortunately,
our community is equipped

10:18.886 --> 10:20.120
to process this.

10:20.153 --> 10:24.324
And, uh, Sarah and I...

10:24.357 --> 10:27.294
um, Sarah and I are putting
new safety measures

10:27.327 --> 10:30.063
into place that will ensure
that our community

10:30.097 --> 10:33.066
is never vulnerable again.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.235
All right... many of you
know Sam Field.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.805
Sam worked in security before
he came to us,

10:37.838 --> 10:40.741
and we are very lucky
to have his expertise.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.909
Sam?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.881
- What happened with Shelby
was a wake-up call.

10:47.915 --> 10:52.219
The FBI is just one of the
threats that we face with IS.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.154
Mass shootings happen
every other week.

10:54.187 --> 10:58.992
The government attacks
faith organizations.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.861
So as of tomorrow,

11:00.894 --> 11:04.832
we will all wear badges to get
in and out of the compound.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.233
- Where's Sarah?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.101
- ID badges?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.137
Seems a little extreme.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.205
- Well, times have changed,
Hank.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.909
I hope you will
cooperate and understand.

11:15.943 --> 11:19.012
- The snake's poison is finally
hitting our bloodstream.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.081
- It's for our safety.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.784
- Repealing rights is always
done in the name of safety.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.985
- Cal!

11:28.021 --> 11:31.792
You know who's never
missed a meeting?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.093
Russel.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.095
The other Armstrong.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.031
Look, Sarah is Co-Guardian
of The Light.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.300
But I guess the rules
don't apply.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.235
Russel follows all of the rules.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.871
- I know, you're right.
- Yeah.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.505
Russel's...
He's a dedicated man.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.475
Sometimes we, uh, we overlook

11:48.508 --> 11:52.312
those who are closest to us.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.981
Thank you for
reminding me of that.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.515
- Thanks, Cal.
- Yeah.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.019
- I mean, Sarah definitely
takes him for granted.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.889
Yeah, but then again, she's all
over the place these days.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.824
You know,
letting the kids see Eddie...

12:03.857 --> 12:08.128
- Yeah, I'm aware that she has
struggled with that in the past.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.897
- Well, let's hope
it's still in the past.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.166
- You're a good wife.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.035
- Thank you.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.052
You've reached
Sarah Lane's voice mail,

12:32.085 --> 12:33.854
please leave a message
after the beep.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.462
I didn't believe 'em.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.368
But here you are all bruised.

12:48.401 --> 12:52.072
- Thought I'd get
more done here.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.408
Compound's great, but it's all
I've ever really known.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.977
Comfortable there.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.147
Too comfortable.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.383
It's like everyone
is colorblind.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.018
- You say that like
it's a bad thing.

13:05.052 --> 13:08.088
- We should be forcing people
to see color.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.857
All color.

13:09.890 --> 13:14.527
To see the difference about how
people are treated still.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.264
I mean, to see the disparity
in schools

13:17.297 --> 13:20.367
and in prisons and...

13:20.400 --> 13:23.403
I mean, I know I'm not
saying anything new.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.938
I get that.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.207
But it's like
James Baldwin said,

13:27.240 --> 13:30.177
"The impossible is the least
that one can demand."

13:34.247 --> 13:37.851
Uh, Baldwin was this writer
and activist...

13:37.885 --> 13:40.553
- I know who he is.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.122
You're sweet, Hawk.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.892
But you spend two nights
in juvie and suddenly

13:44.925 --> 13:48.195
you're breaking free
of your gilded cage,

13:48.228 --> 13:50.197
appropriating black leaders.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.566
- I'm not... I'm not...

13:53.600 --> 13:55.502
I'm sorry if I offended you.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.937
I-I wasn't trying.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.305
- Oh, it's fine.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.340
We're good,
I've just got to be...

14:00.373 --> 14:01.841
somewhere else.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.183
- No.

14:10.217 --> 14:13.153
Actually, I'm not sorry.

14:15.122 --> 14:18.058
I care and I'm not going to
apologize for that.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.429
- The boy's woke.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.034
Come find me later.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.637
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll... I'll try.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.205
I'll try.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.282
- Are you thirsty?
- Starving.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.117
- Starving?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.654
Chocolate?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.489
- Yeah.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.330
Mmm.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.566
I know I should feel guilty...

14:59.599 --> 15:03.336
- What, about the chocolate?
- Please.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.306
But I don't.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.577
Not at all.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.348
This needed to happen.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.317
- One last time.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.055
- Hey.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.523
Don't let it in.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.026
Whatever real life thought
you were thinking,

15:26.059 --> 15:28.962
don't... don't let it in.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.598
Okay?

16:30.390 --> 16:31.758
- Have a moment?

16:40.300 --> 16:43.236
- So you talked to my mom?

16:45.405 --> 16:48.341
- You honor The Movement
with your dedication.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.547
We should honor you in return.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.618
- So I can stay?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.253
- Yeah, no...
- Yeah, not only that,

17:00.287 --> 17:02.822
I would like to invite you
to climb

17:02.855 --> 17:06.659
to 2R with me.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.829
You'd do that?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.832
I mean, it's just 2R.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.234
Are you serious?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.369
- I'd be humbled
to be your guide.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.611
- Thank you.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.658
Why do you feel
guilty about that?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.563
Just feels like I'm...

17:43.596 --> 17:46.533
keeping a dirty little secret.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.802
- Can you say more?

17:49.836 --> 17:53.206
- Um, well I'm just not used to
being dishonest

17:53.240 --> 17:55.375
with people that I care about.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.777
And I care about Chloe.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.414
You know, and her friends say
that she's happy

18:01.448 --> 18:05.752
because of me, and that makes me
feel even worse.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.289
Um, and now,
she wants me to go to

18:09.322 --> 18:11.558
her cousin's wedding.

18:11.591 --> 18:16.296
But, I mean, how am I supposed
to go when I'm not

18:16.329 --> 18:19.266
telling her that
I'm thinking about...

18:23.770 --> 18:26.873
That I'm thinking about
people from my past?

18:26.906 --> 18:30.177
- You're allowed to have
private thoughts.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.687
I know you're coming
from an environment

18:31.711 --> 18:33.213
where that isn't true, but...

18:33.246 --> 18:38.318
- Yes, but she would be hurt
if she knew.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.853
- Why do you think?

18:42.689 --> 18:45.258
- Because I'm supposed to be
moving forward.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.894
- You can have a relationship
that's moving forward

18:47.927 --> 18:50.197
and still make space
for yourself.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.532
- That's "hive mind."

18:52.565 --> 18:54.401
- Thanks, Chelsea.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.236
Uh, we try to
point out to each other,

18:56.269 --> 18:58.805
when we're thinking from
the "cult mind, hive mind,"

18:58.838 --> 19:01.274
as we call it,
because that mind tells us

19:01.308 --> 19:03.576
our private thoughts can hurt.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.546
But the truth is, Eddie, we're
entitled to our own thoughts.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.888
What do you want
your baby to know, Mary?

19:18.325 --> 19:21.494
- I don't know.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.496
- Sure you do.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.531
Go ahead.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.599
Tell him.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.672
- I'll always be there for you,
no matter what.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.674
- That's good.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.477
What else?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.447
- I'll never let you have
a childhood like mine.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.752
- Of course you won't.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.258
Okay.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.859
That's good for today.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.366
You were late
to our session today

19:59.399 --> 20:02.935
and I'm really moved by the work
that you're doing here,

20:02.969 --> 20:06.706
but part of that work
is to show up on time.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.409
- I overslept.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.677
The pregnancy makes me tired.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.512
- I know it makes you tired.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.915
But I'm asking you
to respect our time.

20:15.948 --> 20:20.653
Must be nice, knowing
you're never gonna mess up.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.289
- What do you mean by that?

20:22.322 --> 20:25.958
- Well, I mean,
you know what you do is right.

20:25.992 --> 20:30.763
You're never gonna mess up
your kids, or other people.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.400
Must be why you're worthy
of so much love.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.668
- None of us are
without Damage, Mary.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.437
We all Transgress.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.572
- Even you?

20:39.606 --> 20:42.375
- Is there something else
that you want to say?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.377
- I'm envious.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.912
I'd like to be like you.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.047
- I'm intuiting that you have
anger towards me.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.682
- No.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.518
- But you're at the beginning
of your journey,

20:51.551 --> 20:52.519
so to pass judgment...

20:52.552 --> 20:53.886
- I wasn't...

20:53.920 --> 20:55.655
- Perhaps we should rethink
these sessions

20:55.688 --> 20:58.891
and find a guide that you can
project less onto.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.027
- Well, maybe I'll ask Cal
what he thinks.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.962
He's been super helpful.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.965
Our refrigerator broke, and he
was right there with a new one.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.369
It's the nicest refrigerator
I've ever seen.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.818
Can I see your ID?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.698
Yeah... the line was too long,
we'll get 'em tomorrow.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.858
- I can't let you out
without your ID.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.526
- What do you mean
you can't let me out?

21:33.560 --> 21:34.994
I've been in there all day.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.796
I didn't blow anyone up, did I?

21:36.829 --> 21:38.831
- Hank, it's not his...
- No, no, this is bullshit.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.500
We built this place!

21:40.533 --> 21:41.768
Uh, where's Isiah?

21:41.801 --> 21:44.571
- He's off today.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.773
- Our daughter is Sarah Lane.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.575
You know who Sarah Lane is?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.977
She's The Guardian of
the fucking Light!

22:08.828 --> 22:12.799
This is Cal Roberts, I look
forward to speaking with you.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.970
- Uh, hey, it's me again.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.606
Um...

22:19.639 --> 22:22.875
I was just calling
to see how Hawk is doing.

22:22.909 --> 22:26.413
And I haven't spoken to you
for a while, so...

22:27.880 --> 22:28.915
Anyway, call me.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.551
And I will speak to you then.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.407
What're you suggesting we do?

22:54.441 --> 22:56.476
- Tell the people the truth!

22:56.509 --> 22:57.810
Cal wrote the final rungs.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.679
And we believe he killed Steve.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.014
- I will not make that kind of
accusation without proof!

23:02.048 --> 23:03.616
- You want proof?

23:03.650 --> 23:05.552
It's right here,
in Steve's journals.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.687
We were never meant
to have ID badges

23:07.720 --> 23:09.121
and buildings in New York.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.690
Steve was just lookin'
for a way out.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.134
- A way out of what?
- And the boy knew it.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.126
- What boy?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.804
- He's probably hung it over
Steve's head from childhood...

23:15.828 --> 23:17.564
- You're not talking sense.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.766
- This isn't about
The Movement anymore, Richard.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.534
It's about how I'm gonna
live with myself

23:21.568 --> 23:23.470
for the next 30 years
if I don't do something.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.904
- Wait, what're you saying?

23:24.937 --> 23:26.105
- And I'm the one to do it,

23:26.138 --> 23:28.441
because I've done it before.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.677
- I should never have
gotten you involved.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.848
- Richard.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.488
Richard!

23:41.521 --> 23:42.755
Richard!

23:44.256 --> 23:45.458
Richard!

23:49.496 --> 23:50.739
Okay, got to be honest
and tell me

23:50.763 --> 23:51.907
if I look like Barney
in this thing.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.966
- Barney?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.936
I forget, you have, like,
no cultural references.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.773
Barney's like this, um... it's
like this purple dinosaur

24:00.807 --> 24:05.144
that's, like, kid's show...
It's on TV.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.337
Barney's like this, um... it's
like, what do you think?

24:09.115 --> 24:10.950
- Well, I don't know
who Barney is,

24:10.983 --> 24:13.820
but you look beautiful.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.724
- You're so sweet.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.862
- Hey, what's wrong?

24:22.895 --> 24:24.196
- Nothing.

24:26.165 --> 24:31.070
- Look, I know that you have

24:31.103 --> 24:33.740
social anxiety
and if you don’t want to

24:33.773 --> 24:36.909
come to the wedding with me,
it's... it's totally fine.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.645
I understand.

24:38.678 --> 24:42.148
It meant a lot to me that
you came to that barbeque.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.783
Even though
you had to leave early.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.253
- I miss The Movement.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.722
I miss being there.

24:49.756 --> 24:52.859
Living there that way.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.961
- Yeah, so, what're you saying?

24:54.994 --> 24:57.997
Like, you want to go back?

24:58.030 --> 25:00.967
- No, no, no, it's not about
wanting to go back.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.702
It's just, I miss my life there.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.978
- Okay, so, uh...

25:12.011 --> 25:14.113
how much of this
is about your wife?

25:14.146 --> 25:17.116
- I'm not talking about my wife.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.651
Hey.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.554
I'm talking about
just other things.

25:21.588 --> 25:24.924
- Okay, but you know I can't
help but ask about her, right?

25:24.957 --> 25:29.028
- Uh, yeah, sure...
- I'm sure some of the missing

25:29.061 --> 25:32.565
is tied into her.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.834
- "Some of the missing"?

25:34.867 --> 25:37.970
You still talk to her, Eddie?

25:38.004 --> 25:40.807
Eddie, do you see her?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.575
- Look, I shouldn't have
brought this up.

25:42.609 --> 25:43.843
- No, it's fine.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.680
I... I'm glad you did.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.348
I just...

25:49.381 --> 25:51.818
I don't want to be blindsided,
you know?

25:51.851 --> 25:53.152
If you're thinking...

25:53.185 --> 25:54.821
- I'm allowed
to have thoughts, Chloe!

25:57.323 --> 25:59.125
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.366
- Who is a servant?
- One who serves.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.935
- And what is it to serve?

26:08.968 --> 26:10.837
- To give freely without
expectation of return.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.204
- And to what end?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.674
- To no end.
- Serving is an end in itself.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.176
A circle of giving that frees us
from the cage of ego.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.845
- A cage of whose devising?

26:18.878 --> 26:20.613
- The self.
- The "Neo-self."

26:21.648 --> 26:22.949
Right.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.316
The Neo-self.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.018
Sorry.
Which...

26:26.052 --> 26:28.621
- Hi.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.256
Sorry, I've been calling.

26:30.289 --> 26:33.860
- Yeah, I'm sorry,
I've been so busy.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.796
- Wow, 2R.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.931
When did you decide this?

26:38.965 --> 26:39.966
- Cal said I was ready.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.367
- He's killing it, Sarah.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.336
- You'll be the youngest 2R
in our history.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.076
What... did I say wrong?

26:50.109 --> 26:51.410
- Nothing, Mom.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.443
I'll see you later.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.016
- Wait, you want to grab lunch?

26:57.049 --> 26:59.652
- I have have garden duty.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.821
- Thanks.
- Great job today.

27:01.854 --> 27:02.854
- Bye.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.393
- Bye.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.361
- You want to get some tea?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.140
He's doing so well, Sarah.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.942
- Really?

27:22.975 --> 27:25.244
I can't help but think
this whole moving to the city

27:25.277 --> 27:27.146
is teenage angst.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.781
- I don't know.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.718
We talked deeply,
and I think he's gifted.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.153
- I think he's gifted, too,
but I just...

27:34.186 --> 27:35.988
want to make sure he's ready.

27:36.022 --> 27:39.892
- Well, I believe he is,
but if you feel otherwise...

27:39.926 --> 27:40.927
- No.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.661
I'm sure he is.

27:45.131 --> 27:48.067
- You missed the, uh...
- the security meeting.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.806
- Yeah, I had a Possible.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.075
Uh, a woman in
an abusive relationship.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.777
She needed me.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.012
- Well, I trust that you know
what's the most

28:00.046 --> 28:02.081
important use of your time.

28:04.851 --> 28:08.287
- I had an interesting session
with Mary yesterday.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.756
- Uh, which Mary?

28:09.789 --> 28:11.357
- Cox.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.459
- Right, we have, uh, three now.

28:13.492 --> 28:16.128
It's a popular name.

28:16.162 --> 28:19.298
- She mentioned that
you got her a refrigerator.

28:19.331 --> 28:22.201
- Sean and Mary, yeah.
- Yeah.

28:22.234 --> 28:26.105
She seems to feel that she has
special favor with you.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.406
- Huh.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.443
I don't know that
a refrigerator qualifies

28:31.477 --> 28:33.279
as special favor.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.281
Uh... huh.
Thank you for letting me know.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.516
I appreciate it.

29:35.074 --> 29:38.010
- What're we doing here, Sarah?

29:39.511 --> 29:41.447
- I don't know.

29:43.883 --> 29:47.854
You feeling guilty?

29:47.887 --> 29:50.122
About the girl,
the woman, that you see?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.965
Why are...
Why are you here?

29:58.998 --> 30:01.868
- What do you mean,
why am I here?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.402
I'm here because of you.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.938
'Cause I saw you
and now I can't stop seeing you.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.274
- Okay, but...

30:08.307 --> 30:12.144
I mean, if you were happy,
or content,

30:12.178 --> 30:14.146
you wouldn't be doing this.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.958
Just like I wouldn't
be doing this, so what...

30:15.982 --> 30:17.616
- Okay.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.319
So I admit,
things haven't been easy.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.587
You know, things have changed.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.856
Steve left, you left.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.124
Hawk left.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.060
- Wait, where... where's Hawk?

30:28.094 --> 30:30.496
- He went to live
at the center in the city.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.164
- With Cal?

30:36.903 --> 30:38.070
You let this happen...

30:38.104 --> 30:40.306
- You know what, stop it.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.074
I'm not the only one
to blame for this.

30:42.108 --> 30:46.478
- What the hell
is happening here?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.514
What is this?

30:52.118 --> 30:55.054
You want to know how
I got hit by lightning?

30:58.657 --> 31:01.093
- Yes.

31:01.127 --> 31:04.063
- I went to Peru.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.532
- You said you didn't go.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.301
- Yeah, well, I lied.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.303
I went to Cuzco
when shit started

31:11.337 --> 31:15.107
going down between us.

31:15.141 --> 31:18.644
Because I had this vision...

31:18.677 --> 31:22.548
of Steve dying of cancer.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.283
- What vision?
- Look, I don't know.

31:24.316 --> 31:27.253
Just this...
This feeling, okay?

31:27.286 --> 31:29.221
That something wasn't right.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.290
And guess what?

31:31.323 --> 31:33.125
I was right!

31:33.159 --> 31:35.094
He was.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.964
He wasn't some magic,
immortal Light.

31:37.997 --> 31:41.033
- He was a goddamn man.
- I know.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.644
- You know?
- I found out about it later.

31:42.668 --> 31:45.371
After you left.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.439
- Wait, so if you knew
he was dying of cancer,

31:47.473 --> 31:52.211
then how can you still
believe all this shit?

31:52.244 --> 31:55.614
- Even though Steve had cancer,
he still went

31:55.647 --> 31:57.349
into the Light, Eddie.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.518
It makes him more of a miracle.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.297
Unless there's something else?

32:13.399 --> 32:15.267
Is there something else?

32:15.301 --> 32:16.702
Eddie?

32:19.171 --> 32:21.507
- No.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.540
That's it.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.977
- That's it.

32:38.757 --> 32:42.061
- When we're committed,

32:42.094 --> 32:46.999
when we put the whole above
our individual selves...

32:47.033 --> 32:49.535
we make the group stronger.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.738
That is what this week
has been about.

32:52.771 --> 32:56.342
Strengthening our community,
for our own safety,

32:56.375 --> 32:59.245
for the safety of
our loved ones.

32:59.278 --> 33:02.581
Today, I would like to take
a moment to acknowledge

33:02.614 --> 33:05.251
two people who have stood out
to me this week

33:05.284 --> 33:07.353
for their commitment.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.488
Russel... Russel Armstrong,
where are you?

33:10.589 --> 33:12.324
Yeah, get on up here.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.659
- You're welcome.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.537
- Russel, as you know,
grew up in The Movement.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.107
His commitment is in his DNA.

33:28.140 --> 33:32.444
Sometimes we forget to
acknowledge and reward that.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.046
Eh, better late than never.

33:35.314 --> 33:38.550
Russel, if you are
willing to accept

33:38.584 --> 33:41.187
the challenge of 8R,

33:41.220 --> 33:44.223
I would like to guide you
through that climb,

33:44.256 --> 33:48.694
so that you may join
the ranks of a select few.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.729
Including your sister.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.465
- Yeah.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.781
- Commitment is
particularly inspiring

34:09.815 --> 34:11.717
when it comes from
someone young.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.386
And this week,
a young man came to me,

34:14.420 --> 34:15.786
wanting to know what he could do

34:15.821 --> 34:20.326
to better serve The Movement.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.760
Hawk Lane.

34:27.266 --> 34:31.203
Hawk Lane is ready to serve.

34:32.603 --> 34:37.176
Those words are so full of power
and meaning.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.455
- Hey.

34:49.487 --> 34:50.688
I'm so proud of you.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.725
- Mom.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.462
- Sorry, I won't do that again.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.170
- How're you doing, Mary?

35:38.204 --> 35:40.439
- Good.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.342
- Hear, uh, you're enjoying
your refrigerator.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.480
Leave Sarah out of this.

35:48.514 --> 35:52.384
You know, whatever this is,
it's between you and me.

35:52.418 --> 35:56.388
Bring Sarah into it, and, uh...

35:56.422 --> 35:59.558
and you lose me.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.560
Understand?

36:03.795 --> 36:05.764
Have a good day, Mary.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.467
Hey.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.643
- You know, I was thinking of
taking a walk through the city.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.711
It's just a walk, Gaby,
since we're here.

36:19.745 --> 36:20.979
You're welcome to come.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.481
- No, I'll head back
with the others.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.216
I'm good.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.651
- Okay.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.824
- It's a beautiful day.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.427
- Very.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.763
Congratulations on
your son's Ascension.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.532
And your grandson.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.868
- Thank you.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.803
You haven't seen Kodiak,
have you?

36:47.739 --> 36:48.739
- No.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.984
You are clean.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.487
You are yourself
before the Neo-self.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.788
- I can't...

37:02.821 --> 37:04.623
We are not our Transgressions.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.525
I can't...
You don't understand.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.827
If you can't feel
the Light's forgiveness,

37:08.860 --> 37:10.929
then I can't because of
what I did to you...

37:10.962 --> 37:12.364
- You had to do those things.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.799
If the man you murdered

37:13.832 --> 37:15.401
came back to murder you,

37:15.434 --> 37:16.668
what would you do?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.304
- Let 'em.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.906
- How long have you been there?

37:20.939 --> 37:22.308
My boy.

37:23.542 --> 37:24.702
How long have you been there?

37:26.878 --> 37:28.013
Cal?

37:38.524 --> 37:41.460
- Doesn't work if
you don't do the work.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.396
Purification.

37:49.635 --> 37:52.371
I thought we weren't
keeping secrets anymore?

38:28.474 --> 38:29.808
- Dad.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.043
Is everything okay?

38:32.077 --> 38:35.013
I thought you weren't gonna be
doing this anymore.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.518
- No, I wasn't,
I was... I shouldn't.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.358
You shouldn't be smoking.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.059
- You shouldn't be seeing me.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.063
- Can I have one?

38:52.097 --> 38:53.832
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.846
Trouble in paradise?

39:07.879 --> 39:10.716
- Nothing's right
now that Steve is gone.

39:12.784 --> 39:15.654
- Nothing was right
when he was here, either.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.423
You just couldn't see it.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.797
- Hey.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.709
I need you to run this for
industrial pollutants

39:27.733 --> 39:28.900
and chemicals, okay?

39:28.934 --> 39:30.636
- Sure.
- Bill it to the Meyerist case.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.538
- Under what?
- Offset.

39:39.611 --> 39:40.879
Hmm.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.618
- Uh, how long have you
been standing there?

39:46.652 --> 39:50.522
- Long enough to see the newest
2R is really feelin' himself.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.425
I was, um...

39:55.226 --> 39:58.163
Can you help me with something?

40:02.834 --> 40:04.135
Cut it off.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.871
- What?

40:05.904 --> 40:07.782
Hawk, I was kidding before,
I don't really think

40:07.806 --> 40:09.508
you're too high
on yourself or anything.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.509
- I-I get that.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.811
But...

40:12.844 --> 40:14.446
this isn't me anymore.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.617
- But it's so pretty.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.722
- Uh... yeah.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.724
- You really want me to do this?

41:56.247 --> 41:59.217
- I've lost vision
for The Movement.

42:02.053 --> 42:05.657
I'm stuck, and I'm having
trouble moving forward.

42:05.691 --> 42:08.860
- What do you think
is holding you back?

42:08.894 --> 42:11.830
- I've been sleeping with Eddie.

42:16.635 --> 42:20.238
- Love is often more powerful

42:20.271 --> 42:22.240
than faith.

42:22.273 --> 42:25.811
It can be a prison
that holds us hostage

42:25.844 --> 42:27.779
from who we could be.

42:27.813 --> 42:29.748
It weakens us.

42:32.350 --> 42:35.286
I want you to
close your eyes, Sarah.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.693
I want you to think about Eddie.

42:41.727 --> 42:44.295
I want you to imagine him.

42:44.329 --> 42:46.064
Hold his image.

42:47.332 --> 42:49.701
You have it?

42:49.735 --> 42:51.770
Tell me what you see.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.772
His beautiful eyes.

42:56.675 --> 42:57.976
Looking into me.

42:58.009 --> 42:59.044
- Good.

42:59.077 --> 43:02.781
Yes.

43:02.814 --> 43:06.384
Now he's going to
turn away from you.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.386
You're going to turn him away.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.991
Can you do that?

43:13.024 --> 43:15.994
I want you to let him walk away.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.297
Tell me what you see.

43:24.736 --> 43:27.238
He's walking away from me.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.878
I can, um...
only see his back now.

43:32.911 --> 43:34.780
Where the lightning hit him.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.917
The tangle of red lines.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.251
- He was struck by lightning?

43:40.285 --> 43:42.688
- He's walking away.

43:42.721 --> 43:44.422
- He was struck by lightning
in Peru?

43:46.324 --> 43:47.759
- How did you know?

43:49.460 --> 43:50.460
Richard.

43:52.864 --> 43:54.065
Richard.

43:54.099 --> 43:55.099
Richard?

44:01.707 --> 44:03.041
- Kodiak?

44:07.979 --> 44:09.715
Wait, please!

44:09.748 --> 44:11.458
It wasn't Cal that was
on the mountain with Steve.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.118
It was Eddie!
Eddie Lane was there

44:13.151 --> 44:14.720
when Steve died!

44:14.753 --> 44:16.287
It was Eddie Lane!

44:34.906 --> 44:36.942
Commitment to
another human being

44:36.975 --> 44:39.845
in this day and age

44:39.878 --> 44:42.147
is an heroic attempt

44:42.180 --> 44:44.850
to overcome incredible odds.

44:44.883 --> 44:49.154
There's no point in reinforcing
frothy emotionalism.

44:49.187 --> 44:52.323
There is enough of that
out there in the world.

44:52.357 --> 44:55.927
I read somewhere
that when you promise

44:55.961 --> 44:57.495
fidelity to your beloved,

44:57.528 --> 45:00.732
you are promising it
to yourself.

45:00.766 --> 45:03.902
All of our relationships,
all of our loves,

45:03.935 --> 45:07.906
need that daily attention
and care.

45:07.939 --> 45:10.508
Okay, so tell me...

45:10.541 --> 45:11.910
- What?

45:13.544 --> 45:15.881
- Tell me about all
the things that you miss.

45:17.916 --> 45:18.950
Look, no judgment, okay?

45:18.984 --> 45:21.219
I just...

45:21.252 --> 45:23.288
I just want to know.

45:23.321 --> 45:25.891
- Well, my... my kids.

45:25.924 --> 45:28.393
- Obviously.
- Yeah, of course.

45:28.426 --> 45:32.397
- And, uh, the people.
- You know?

45:32.430 --> 45:34.532
They're just...
They're open,

45:34.565 --> 45:37.502
they're receptive.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.271
Like you.

45:40.305 --> 45:43.208
I mean,
I-I love that about you.

45:53.084 --> 45:54.385
Come on, Chloe!

45:56.554 --> 45:58.056
- Come on, Chloe.
- Oh, my God.

45:58.089 --> 45:59.490
No!

45:59.524 --> 46:01.893
You promised you'd
sing our song for us.

46:01.927 --> 46:03.895
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

46:03.929 --> 46:06.231
- I guess I go up stage.
- Get up there.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.399
- Come on.
- Oh, Lord.

46:10.035 --> 46:11.402
Here we go.
