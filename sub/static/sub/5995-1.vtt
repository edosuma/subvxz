I felt, like, a really palpable
connection with the audience.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.062
And-and I know that it
was, like, a bummer
my mom didn't show,

00:30.064 --> 00:33.032
But in that moment,
it was like everyone was my mom.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.500

the mock-trial summer intensive.

Ugh, she wasn't even
gonna let me go here,

But then I called my dad
on his honeymoon in the bahamas,

00:43.044 --> 00:44.510
And I told him I was having
suicidal thoughts,

that great pizza place...

15:58.391 --> 16:00.191
Oh, downtown...

What was the name of it?

16:01.361 --> 16:02.560
D-something.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.695
Gosh, have you heard
of that one?

16:03.697 --> 16:05.330
D...

16:05.332 --> 16:07.031
Yeah. Uh-huh.

16:07.033 --> 16:07.966
Did you?
Oh, it's great.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.167
Oh, it's so good.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.969
And they fold it up
and it's thin crust

16:10.971 --> 16:13.638
And the sauce
and there's all the cheese.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.023
That's pizza. Yeah.

You know, actually,
we have some great places

16:16.409 --> 16:17.508
Right here in the cove.
Uh-huh.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.509
You know, there's, uh...

16:18.511 --> 16:20.078
A wine bar on foothill

16:20.080 --> 16:22.347
That has a killer riesling.
Uh-huh.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.048
It's actually called
jimmy's house of spirits.
Uh-huh.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.084
It's like a liquor store
and a wine bar.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.586
Also, in the restaurant
in the hilton,

16:28.588 --> 16:30.154
They have, um,
something called branzino.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.322
You ever heard
of branzino?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.657
Yes, I have.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.093
It's a fish.
I know.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.995
Really?
Yeah. Of course.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.062
'cause I thought
it was a sandwich.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.163
Well, anyway, I'm just...

16:39.165 --> 16:40.498

16:46.072 --> 16:47.772
Well, four in traffic.
So I hear.

16:47.774 --> 16:51.109
I feel like you and I
are gonna have a lot in common.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.044
And I'm not just talking
about the pizza and the fish.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.045
Mm-hmm.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.063
Oh, you know what?

16:55.064 --> 16:56.080
Until my business
cards come in,

16:56.082 --> 16:57.832
I'm gonna take
a few of these,

16:57.833 --> 16:59.583
In case anyone asks
what I'm doing in town.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.752
And I can show them
this and be like,

17:00.754 --> 17:02.353
"I have a job.
It's legitimate."

17:02.355 --> 17:04.522
(laughs nervously)

17:04.524 --> 17:06.624
Okay.
So this is
the kitchen.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.596

17:11.598 --> 17:13.297
Harvard? Yale?

17:13.299 --> 17:14.465

17:14.467 --> 17:15.666

17:15.668 --> 17:17.402
What the hell is she doing here?

17:17.404 --> 17:18.369
(exhales)

17:18.371 --> 17:20.338
Exactly.
It makes no sense.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.707
Uh, rebecca,

17:22.709 --> 17:24.108

17:25.111 --> 17:26.377

17:33.753 --> 17:35.586
Sorry. Hi.
Hi.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.088
Nice to
meet you.
Yeah.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.624
Two years of training,
six months of night school

17:39.626 --> 17:41.692
And 15 years of experience,
but...

17:41.694 --> 17:43.094
Never mind.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.330
Those are some great
knock-off louboutins.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.634
Yeah.
I know how to say it.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.170

17:52.172 --> 17:53.738

17:53.740 --> 17:55.706

17:55.708 --> 17:57.341

and has fake hair.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.609

17:58.611 --> 18:00.745
Everyone knows that, right,
mrs. Hernandez?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.313
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's mrs. Hernandez.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.648
She's our communications
director.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.083
Oh, great! Hi!

18:05.085 --> 18:06.217
So nice to meet you.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.218

18:07.220 --> 18:08.686

in business" seminar

18:10.439 --> 18:12.189

came back with that death grip.

18:12.192 --> 18:16.094

18:16.096 --> 18:18.563

18:18.565 --> 18:19.564

18:56.469 --> 18:57.535
Wow.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.370
I, uh...

18:59.372 --> 19:00.671
Love all the wolf imagery.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.141
Yeah, I went to
a swap meet in gardena

19:03.143 --> 19:04.976
And got all this.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.810
I keep the pelts at home
because they shed a little bit.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.613
Uh-huh.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.382
Okay...
Look, I wasn't
going to...

19:11.384 --> 19:13.351
Talk about this
out there, because, well,

19:13.353 --> 19:15.186
I mean, you know
how offices

19:15.188 --> 19:16.521
Can be, you know.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.856
It can be very gossipy.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.190
But I'm in the middle
of a divorce.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.825
Right. Yeah, you mentioned that.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.460
And my wife, well,

19:22.462 --> 19:24.162
She's got a very powerful
pit bull lawyer.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.730
I mean, this guy's amazing.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.698
One of those real smart
jewish guys.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.234
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm...
I'm jewish.

19:30.236 --> 19:30.835
Really?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.503
Yeah, but it's okay.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.272
I... I honestly had no idea.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.706
That is a tiny nose.

19:35.708 --> 19:36.707
It's like a button.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.676
Thank you.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.745
Look... (sighs)

19:41.748 --> 19:43.781
(crying):
I'm sorry.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.815
It's just that...

19:44.817 --> 19:46.918
I'm in kind of a bind here.

19:46.920 --> 19:47.952
(sobbing):
Oh, geez.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.656
Oh, I didn't want
to do this.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.592
Um...
(sobbing)

19:54.594 --> 19:56.861
Oh...
Um...

19:56.863 --> 19:59.197
(sobbing)

19:59.199 --> 20:00.798
I like the wolf
with the bandana.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.867
That's my favorite, too.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.572
I just can't lose her.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.706
I can't lose her.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.975
Darryl, uh...

20:10.977 --> 20:12.777
You know,
there's other fish in the sea.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.212
Right?

20:14.214 --> 20:16.581
It's not healthy to keep
fixating on one person.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.582
The relationship's over...

20:17.584 --> 20:18.950
I am not talking about my wife.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.685
I am talking about my daughter.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.852
My ex-wife is trying

20:21.854 --> 20:24.722
To get madison away from me.
Huh?

20:24.724 --> 20:27.291
I want you to represent me
in my case.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.859
Oh...
No, you're right.

20:28.861 --> 20:29.860
I'm sorry. I...

20:29.862 --> 20:30.995
This is so inappropriate.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.763
Oh, jiminy christmas.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.799
I don't know what I'm doing.
Uh, look, darryl,

20:34.801 --> 20:36.934
I'm very flattered that-that
you asked me to represent you,

20:36.936 --> 20:38.536
But you know my specialty's
real estate law.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.870
I wouldn't be qualified...

20:39.872 --> 20:41.839
I know, but I just want
to see my wife's face.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.241
I mean, her jew

20:43.243 --> 20:44.609
Went to csu long beach.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.744
My jew?
Harvard and yale.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.613
Mmm?

20:48.615 --> 20:49.580
Can I think about it?

20:49.582 --> 20:50.881
I will think
about it, sincerely,

20:50.883 --> 20:53.017
Because I see that
you're a really good dad.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.585
But you know, that's why
I moved to west covina,

20:54.587 --> 20:56.754
To be with families who care.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.723
And I care, too.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.325
And I promise that I will
always be there for you.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.627
(phone chimes)
hold on one second.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.763
But right now, I got a thing.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.865
I'm gonna go
do this thing.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.900
Doesn't mean that I don't care,
I'm just gonna go do the thing.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.752
I will come back later...

21:11.753 --> 21:13.603
And let's circle back
about the jew thing.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.840
'cause that's a conversation
that we need to have.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.879
The jew thing?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.881
Why did I say that?

21:27.854 --> 21:29.920
♪ ♪

21:34.360 --> 21:37.662
Announcer:
...Curve-balling out about
five to ten miles per hour.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.364
Jerry murdoch steps in

21:40.366 --> 21:43.868
He hit two home runs
in the second inning,

21:43.870 --> 21:47.638
But down three now,
here in the bottom of the fifth.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.441
Are you lost?

21:50.443 --> 21:51.842
The wine bar's
over on foothill.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.944
I'm just here for some baseball.

21:53.946 --> 21:54.812
Sounds good.

21:54.814 --> 21:55.846
What can I get you?

21:55.848 --> 21:57.381
Beer, please.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.649
Any kind.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.987
You from around here?

22:02.989 --> 22:04.922
Never seen you before.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.857
I actually just moved
to town from new york.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.526
Seriously?

22:08.528 --> 22:10.061
I love new york.
What-what brings you here?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.029
Work and, um...

22:12.031 --> 22:15.533
I-I'm actually here
because I'm meeting a friend.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.401
But I don't...

22:17.403 --> 22:19.070
I don't see him.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.805
Great. Maybe I know him.

22:20.807 --> 22:21.939
Is he eight years old?
Or an alcoholic?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.541
'cause that's what
we've got here.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.711
You're a good listener.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.546
Hmm?
Exactly.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.014
You know, a buddy of mine
just moved back from new york.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.349
Guy I grew up with.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.717
Really?
Yeah.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.818
But there's no way
you know him, right?

22:33.820 --> 22:34.819
It's a big city.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.020
I might.
What's his name?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.888
Josh chan.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.057
Oh, my god, are you kidding?

22:40.059 --> 22:41.926
That's crazy!
I... I know him!

22:41.928 --> 22:43.694
Seriously?
Yeah. Yeah.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.496
That's crazy.
He was just here.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.797
You just missed him.

22:46.799 --> 22:47.898
That... That's
his beer.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.000
Ah!

22:50.002 --> 22:51.602
Mmm!

22:51.604 --> 22:52.603
(laughs)

22:52.605 --> 22:53.604
Um, yeah.

22:53.606 --> 22:54.705
Oh, mmm...

22:54.707 --> 22:57.675
Um, it's actually
such a funny s-story.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.976
So, I was in new york,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.778
But I was looking
to relocate to los angeles

23:00.780 --> 23:01.879
Because I'm just,
I'm a beach gal.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.882
Uh, so I run into chan
and he tells me

23:04.884 --> 23:05.950
How great west covina is.

23:05.951 --> 23:07.017
And I'm like, okay,
filing it away, filing it away.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.285
But then, boom!

23:08.286 --> 23:09.552
That same day,
I get this rando call

23:09.555 --> 23:10.621
From a one-eighth chippewa

23:10.623 --> 23:11.922
Who's very prominent
in my field,

23:11.924 --> 23:13.958
Asking me to start
a position here.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.593
Crazy, right?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.061
Wait.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.129
So you left a job
in new york

23:18.131 --> 23:19.463
To live near
the beach?

23:19.465 --> 23:20.715
We're four hours
from the beach.

23:20.716 --> 23:21.966
People say two, but
those people are dumb.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.402
Yeah, but, like, you know,
it's such a great place.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.804
I mean, the motto is
"live, work, play."
we have a motto?

23:26.806 --> 23:28.639
Yes, on the web site.
We have a web site?

23:28.641 --> 23:31.008
It takes a few minutes to load,
but it's very informative.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.676
This is where I live.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.078
Yay for me.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.946
So, anyway, to go
back to my, um, story.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.047
Please do.
So I got here

23:37.049 --> 23:38.416
And I reached out
to josh, but...

23:38.418 --> 23:39.884
He hasn't gotten back to me,

23:39.886 --> 23:41.585
So I don't if he-he dropped
his phone in the toilet,

23:41.587 --> 23:42.687
'cause I did that once

23:42.688 --> 23:43.788
And I was out of commission
for hours.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.456
So maybe he did that.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.624
Do you know where he went,
though?

23:46.626 --> 23:47.992
'cause I'd love to, like...
No.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.493
No idea. He said
he was going out,

23:49.495 --> 23:50.795
But he didn't say where.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.563
Okay. Thanks.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.834
But I, uh... It's funny.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.135
I do know where
he's gonna be tomorrow night.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.970
Yeah?

23:59.972 --> 24:01.672
Yeah. This guy, beans

24:01.674 --> 24:03.474
--We call him that,
he's mexican--

24:03.476 --> 24:05.910
That sounds racist,
but he named himself that

24:05.912 --> 24:07.845
And he kind of makes us call him
that; we don't want to.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.013
His actual name's bernard.
It doesn't matter.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.115
Anyway, he's having
a house party.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.716
It should be
a lot of fun and, um...

24:12.718 --> 24:13.918
Josh is going.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.052
And I'm going.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.120
(exhales)

24:18.124 --> 24:19.924
Do you want to go?

24:19.926 --> 24:21.442
Yeah. Is there, like,

24:21.443 --> 24:22.959
A paperless post
that I should reply to?

24:22.962 --> 24:23.961
Why don't we...

24:23.963 --> 24:25.963
Why don't we just go together?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.097
Great, yeah.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.899
Okay, so, um...

24:28.901 --> 24:32.036
So you'll come to me, in a car?

24:32.038 --> 24:34.472
Yes, like... A date.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.774
Because you're pretty
and you're smart

24:36.776 --> 24:38.943
And you're ignoring me,
so you're obviously my type.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.044
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

24:40.046 --> 24:42.079
Perfect.

24:42.081 --> 24:42.980
(sighs)

24:42.982 --> 24:44.048
A party.

24:45.818 --> 24:49.086
Big party.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.123
(singing to self)

24:57.497 --> 24:58.496
Ooh! (laughs)

24:58.498 --> 24:59.797
You were right
behind me.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.098
Yeah.
What's up?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.933
Uh, about the ramirez case:

25:02.935 --> 25:04.268
The judge refused
to grant the stay,

25:04.270 --> 25:06.837
So we present our arguments
on Wednesday.

25:06.839 --> 25:07.972
Well, that's swell,

25:07.974 --> 25:09.540
Because I'm really
good at arguing.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.009
Oh! Before I forget
to tell you, though,

25:12.011 --> 25:13.544
I do not like the judge
in that case.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.079
I want judge egan.
I did a little research.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.147
So what I need you to do
is petition the court.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.183
We will get judge egan

25:19.185 --> 25:21.719
And we will crush
that illegal water park.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.824
You're in a good mood today.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.126
Yeah, ever just have,
like, a great day?

25:29.128 --> 25:31.562
No.

25:31.564 --> 25:32.563
Really?

25:32.565 --> 25:34.064
That's, like, really sad.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.065
Okay.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.201
So...

25:37.203 --> 25:39.069
You mentioned you didn't know
anyone in town.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.204
No. Not a soul.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.272
Living or dead.

25:41.274 --> 25:42.740
Don't know no ghosts.
(giggles)

25:42.742 --> 25:44.842
Okay, stop.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.076
Something is wrong.

25:46.078 --> 25:49.079
I am not buying any of this.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.848
Okay, yeah, again,

25:50.850 --> 25:52.283
The reason that I'm here--

25:52.285 --> 25:53.951
'cause you seem, like,
weirded out

25:53.953 --> 25:55.052
With my whole presence--

25:55.054 --> 25:56.887
Is because I moved here

25:56.888 --> 25:58.721
'cause I got a really great
offer from darryl.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.190
(stammering loudly)

26:00.192 --> 26:02.159
It's okay,
don't tell me the truth.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.060
In fact,

26:03.062 --> 26:04.795
Thank you

26:04.797 --> 26:06.163
For not telling
me the truth,

26:06.165 --> 26:08.165
Because I will figure it out.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.133
Ah!

26:09.135 --> 26:10.935
Now I have something fun to do.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.903
Okay, well,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.805
I'm glad that
this is really fun for you.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.941

28:53.399 --> 28:55.332
Oh, I totally just woke up
from a nap.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.808
So, I got accepted

29:04.810 --> 29:06.510
To business school at emory.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.812
Mm-hmm.
Uh, and then my dad got sick.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.848
Um, my parents are divorced.
Mm-hmm.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.516
So I...
Oh, uh, mine are divorced, too.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.885
Yeah, yeah, like,
they're really divorced.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.120
We're like peas in a pod.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.154
To broken people.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.522
To broken people.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.424
(chuckles)

29:20.426 --> 29:22.292
You know, it's so weird.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.962
I, like, haven't seen josh yet.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.363
What's...

29:26.365 --> 29:27.831
What's the deal
with you and josh?

29:27.833 --> 29:30.434
Because we've been talking
about him a lot.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.035
What? Come on.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.537
Dude, he's just...
You know, I told you.

29:33.539 --> 29:34.989
He's, like,
an old friend of mine.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.440
I just, like, I want to,
I want to see him

29:36.442 --> 29:37.975
And want to see him
and surprise him.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.509
You're sure?
Because if you were into him,
yeah.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.779
I would totally get it.
He's a good-looking guy.

29:41.781 --> 29:42.780
He's built like a brick house.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.481
Okay, uh-huh.
He knows magic.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.519
Okay, I'll shut up about that.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.788
Yeah.

29:54.059 --> 29:55.492
Hey.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.127
Do you want to go outside?

30:00.499 --> 30:02.366
Actually, um, I'm cold.
Let's go inside.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.269
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

30:05.271 --> 30:06.470
Uh...

30:09.308 --> 30:10.474
Hey, is...

30:10.476 --> 30:12.843
Something wrong?

30:12.845 --> 30:14.444
No, no, no.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.114
Um, do you want
find a bedroom?

30:17.116 --> 30:18.482
No.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.250
I would not... Yes.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.422
Is this room okay?

30:25.424 --> 30:26.557
Yeah, it's fine.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.325
Is it okay
that josh isn't in here?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.560
Or...
Yeah, it's fine.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.895
(chuckles)

30:31.897 --> 30:33.463
(phone chimes)
oh.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.466
Ah, speak of the
handsome devil himself.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.901
Chan just texted.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.603
"not gonna come tonight."

30:39.605 --> 30:43.273
His girlfriend's making him go
to her sister's quinseñera.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.581
Sorry. Um...

30:50.583 --> 30:52.516
Josh has a girlfriend?

30:52.518 --> 30:55.552
Just 'cause facebook
says he's single.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.588
Okay, I'm getting
the josh vibe again.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.590
Maybe we should just
go back to the party.

30:59.592 --> 31:01.859
No, no, that's crazy.
Come-come here, crazy.

31:07.967 --> 31:11.034
Like, if you must know,
josh isn't my type.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.209
But, like, speaking of types,

31:19.211 --> 31:21.478
Like, what type's
his girlfriend?

31:21.480 --> 31:22.546
I should go.
No, no.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.982
(in baby voice):
Where you going?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.050
Where's the little boy going?

31:29.989 --> 31:32.256
Are you going anywhere now?

31:32.258 --> 31:34.124
No.
Okay, good.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.894
Is this, does this feel good?

31:36.896 --> 31:38.095
You really like
talking, don't you?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.229
Okay, I'll stop.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.631
I'll stop,
I'll stop, I'll stop.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.933
I'll stop talking. Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, I'll stop talking.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.785
But just, like,

31:44.786 --> 31:46.636
Circling back to josh for just,
like, a quick second.

31:46.639 --> 31:49.006
I know, I know,
just a quick second.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.674
Um, like, where did he,
where did he,

31:50.676 --> 31:52.242
Where'd he meet his girlfriend?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.610
Like, what's their,
what's their story?

31:53.612 --> 31:54.945
What's their deal?

31:54.947 --> 31:56.313
They dated in high school.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.915
He moved back to be with her.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.050
Oh.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.686
Got it.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.687
Okay, good.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.589
I'm so, I'm happy for him.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.225
(crying):
He moved back here for her.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.160
It's like,
it's like<i> the notebook.</i>

32:10.162 --> 32:11.662
(zipping)
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:11.664 --> 32:14.148
I, uh,
what? What?

32:14.149 --> 32:16.633
I can't believe I'm doing this,
because I-I really...

32:16.635 --> 32:17.668
I really need this,

32:17.670 --> 32:19.336
But, um, I don't know much,

32:19.338 --> 32:20.671
But what I do know
is it's not good

32:20.673 --> 32:22.472
To hook up with a crying girl.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.141
No, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not crying.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.275
I'm not crying. I'm fine.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.376
No, you're not.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.346
Hey, whatever it is,

32:29.348 --> 32:31.048
I really don't think
you should be here.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.951
Come on.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.219
I'll drive you home.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.621
Okay. Are you sure?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.122
I can do that.
Yeah, yeah, no, hey.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.691
No, no, no, no, no.
You've done enough.

32:40.693 --> 32:43.293
Okay, okay.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.028
(sighs, zippers)

32:45.030 --> 32:47.097
(groans)

33:02.681 --> 33:04.982
Huh?

33:09.989 --> 33:12.389
Um, what are you doing here?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.724
I just stopped in
to chat with you.

33:13.726 --> 33:15.425
Who's this?
You want to chat?

33:15.427 --> 33:16.727
Who are you?

33:16.729 --> 33:19.129
Um, greg, uh, paula.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.630
Paula, greg.
Hi there.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.599
You half italian?

33:22.601 --> 33:24.301
Uh, yeah?

33:24.303 --> 33:25.502
I can always tell.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.670
Okay, all right.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.055
I don't know what you're doing.

33:28.056 --> 33:29.439
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
We'll be back, greg.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.241
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll ichat you or something.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.477
No, I'll just...

33:33.479 --> 33:35.545
I'll just wait here.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.649
Where are we... Is this
far enough from the house?
Come here.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.184
What are you doing here?

33:41.186 --> 33:43.387
You think you are
so much better than me, huh?

33:43.389 --> 33:45.022
Harvard? Yale?

33:45.024 --> 33:46.757
I am just as smart as you are,
miss snooty shoes.

33:46.759 --> 33:48.125
What are you talking about?

33:48.127 --> 33:49.359
I'm talking about josh.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.694
Chan.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.795
Yeah.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.330
Josh ch... Josh chan!

33:53.332 --> 33:55.665
Josh chan!
Okay, hey, hey, hey! Hey.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.034
What do you know about josh?
What do I know about josh?

33:57.036 --> 33:58.735
Uh, let's see, um,

33:58.737 --> 34:00.337
I know he lives in town,
which is weird,

34:00.339 --> 34:01.805
Because you told
you didn't know anyone here,

34:01.807 --> 34:03.540
And clearly,

34:03.541 --> 34:05.274
You know him,
because you checked his facebook

34:05.277 --> 34:07.044
63 times today

34:07.046 --> 34:09.112
And his instagram 18 times.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.414
Have you been going
through my computer?

34:10.416 --> 34:12.049
Yes, yes, I have.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.250
I could have you fired.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.718
Oh, you lied to me.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.286
I wasn't lying to you.
I wasn't under oath

34:16.288 --> 34:17.587
When I met you in the office.

34:17.589 --> 34:18.989
All right, you know what?

34:18.990 --> 34:20.390
Did someone shove a bible
under my hand?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.059
This is not the point.
The point is

34:22.061 --> 34:23.226
Whoever this josh chan is,

34:23.228 --> 34:24.694
You are,
you're obsessed with him.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.696
(laughs) what?

34:26.698 --> 34:28.365
You love him,
you moved here for him,

34:28.367 --> 34:31.134
And you won't admit it. Why?

34:31.136 --> 34:33.403
Wow, okay. I do not love him.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.838
I barely know him.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.574
I dated him for two months
when I was 16 at a summer camp.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.142
So you're saying
that I moved here

34:39.144 --> 34:40.577
From new york
and I left behind a job

34:40.579 --> 34:43.280
That would've paid me
$545,000 a year

34:43.282 --> 34:45.082
For a guy who still skateboards?

34:45.084 --> 34:46.283
I did not do that.

34:46.285 --> 34:47.617
Here's what happened.
I was in new york.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.586
I ran into josh.
He made me feel warm inside.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.254
Like glitter was exploding
inside me.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.489
Then I moved here.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.341
I did not move here
because of josh,

34:54.342 --> 34:56.192
Because that would be crazy,
and I am not crazy.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.665
Oh, my god.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.167
Oh, my god.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.336
No, I'm not crazy.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.605
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.707
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.
Okay, no, stop it.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.159
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my god, I'm crazy.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.610
Stop it. Listen.
Oh, my god, I'm crazy.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.145
No, no, no, no, I'm crazy.
Oh, my god, I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.679
You hear me, you're not crazy.
You're in love.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.381
And that is,
that is totally different.

35:18.383 --> 35:20.550
No, I'm not in love.
That would be stupid.
Hey, wait, whoa.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.185
You're not stupid.
That would make me stupid.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.320
You just should've told me.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.654
That's all. I-I-I'm just,

35:24.656 --> 35:26.301
I was busting your balls
'cause you lied to me.

35:26.302 --> 35:27.947
Okay, no...
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

35:27.948 --> 35:29.593
All right, this is going
down a road
I'm crazy and I'm irrational

35:29.595 --> 35:31.428
That I am not...
And I'm everything
my mother said I was.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.363
Now stop it!

35:33.365 --> 35:36.266
Don't you talk about my friend
like that ever again.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.435
Do you hear me?

35:38.437 --> 35:40.504
We're friends?

35:40.506 --> 35:42.706
(chuckles)

35:42.708 --> 35:45.609
I would be proud
to be your friend,

35:45.611 --> 35:47.611
Now that I know the truth.

35:47.613 --> 35:50.413
What you did for love,
for true love,

35:50.415 --> 35:52.215
The sacrifices,

35:52.217 --> 35:54.751
The-the money
that you walked away from...

35:54.753 --> 35:56.620
Oh, god.
No, no, no, no, no. No.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.688
You're not crazy,
and you're not stupid.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.590
You know what you are?
You're brave.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.692
And I wish that I had been

36:02.694 --> 36:06.663
As brave when I was your age.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.265
Okay, look,

36:08.267 --> 36:09.699
You want it to be a secret?
I get it.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.601
I will not tell a soul, okay?

36:11.603 --> 36:12.802
But-but I'm here now.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.172
Okay, you are not in this alone.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.540
And I will, I will help you.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.441
Let me help you,
'cause we can win this thing!

36:18.443 --> 36:19.910
(whispering):
We can win it.

36:19.912 --> 36:21.444
We can... (exhales)

36:21.446 --> 36:22.812
We can win the whole thing.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.514
Okay?

36:24.516 --> 36:25.882
It doesn't matter, um...

36:25.884 --> 36:28.652
Because I just found out
that josh has a girlfriend.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.687
What?
No, it makes sense, because I
texted him

36:30.689 --> 36:32.856
46 hours ago
and he hasn't gotten back to me,

36:32.858 --> 36:34.357
Because he's busy
with his girlfriend.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.525
No, no, no.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.943
His facebook status
says he's single,

36:36.944 --> 36:38.360
And if he was into her,
why would it say that?

36:38.363 --> 36:40.664
That's what I said.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.799
Exactly. All right.
This is why you need me.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.568
All right, look,

36:44.570 --> 36:46.803
If we play this right,
one day,

36:46.805 --> 36:48.905
It is gonna hit him

36:48.907 --> 36:52.309
Like a bag of nails
to the balls,

36:52.311 --> 36:53.643
And that day,

36:53.645 --> 36:56.780
He will text.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.882
(phone chimes)

37:00.219 --> 37:01.751
Are you a witch?

37:03.488 --> 37:04.988
I-I can't.
I think I might faint.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.224
Just, I can't,
I can't, I can't.
Okay, hold on, no, no, no.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.959
I can't...
(gasps)

37:08.961 --> 37:10.594
What? (gasps)
josh chan.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.728
Oh, god, oh, god.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.663
"want to grab dinner?"

37:14.499 --> 37:15.865
Smiley face.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.701
My god, is it really smiley?
There's a smiley face!

You want to go drive

Rebecca:
You know where he lives?

38:24.836 --> 38:27.871
This is gonna be
so much fun.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.574
Hey, denise.
It's me, nipsey hussle.

38:31.576 --> 38:33.843
I recently had
an eye-opening experience.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.313
I'm calling to apologize
for the way I treated you

38:36.315 --> 38:38.381
When you danced
in my recent music video.

38:38.383 --> 38:41.785
Denise, I'm sorry that
I showered you with cristal.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.620
I didn't even ask
if you liked champagne,

38:43.622 --> 38:45.822
And it probably messed up
your blow out.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.391
Ashley, I realize now
that it wasn't right for me

38:48.393 --> 38:50.060
To tell you what to do
with that big fat butt.

38:50.062 --> 38:51.628
You can wiggle it,

38:51.630 --> 38:52.962
Or you could sit it down
in a classroom

38:52.964 --> 38:55.465
And get that college degree
in communications.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.435
Chelsea, I'm sorry I put you in
a bikini made of gold coins

38:58.437 --> 39:00.704
And then made you dance
on the roof of my bentley.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.405
I realize now
that metal conducts heat

39:02.407 --> 39:05.375
And that was probably a very
uncomfortable experience.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.477
Anyway, denise, hit me up
whenever you get this.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.012
I'd love to discuss
<i>the second sex</i>

39:09.014 --> 39:11.748
By simone de beauvoir,
which I just read.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.917
You are beautiful inside
as well as out.

39:13.919 --> 39:15.919
You are my equal.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.921
Captioning sponsored by
cbs

39:17.923 --> 39:19.989
And toyota.
