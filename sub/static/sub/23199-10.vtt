WEBVTT

00:07.074 --> 00:10.704
Thirty-seven light years from Earth,
in the star system Signus Alpha...

00:10.787 --> 00:13.081
a combat commander from
the planet Octarus...

00:13.164 --> 00:15.501
fights a battle that begins in space...

00:15.710 --> 00:18.672
but will subsequently be fought
on American soil.

00:19.131 --> 00:20.882
Andros to base command.

00:21.091 --> 00:23.594
Outlaws north vector 120.

00:23.928 --> 00:26.390
Interceptors being dispatched.

00:26.473 --> 00:28.308
The Skrill are attempting to escape.

00:28.392 --> 00:30.770
They appear to be successfully doing so.

00:31.229 --> 00:33.732
Andros has his squadron after them.

00:34.566 --> 00:36.527
Unsuccessfully.

00:41.324 --> 00:43.452
They've both just been destroyed.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.912
Perhaps.

00:45.705 --> 00:47.666
We shall see.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.269 --> 01:07.481
- Andros to base pad.
- Go ahead, Commander.

01:07.565 --> 01:09.526
I am on docking trajectory.

01:09.609 --> 01:12.863
Approaching main terminal, berth three.
Locking on automatic.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.782
We read you, Commander.

01:15.074 --> 01:19.955
Make a 185-degree turn
and adjust to the beta-phase trajectory.

02:12.394 --> 02:14.439
As did his father before him...

02:14.522 --> 02:17.401
Andros Will tra vel to Earth
and join With Wonder Woman...

02:17.484 --> 02:19.778
in a battle for the Earth's survival.

02:35.173 --> 02:38.468
We are sorry to summon you
so early, Andros.

02:38.886 --> 02:42.222
I don't mind being summoned early.
What I mind is failure.

02:42.306 --> 02:45.518
- Then the Skrill have escaped?
- Yes, Sell.

02:45.602 --> 02:49.481
Fortunately, the interceptor guard ships
that were pursuing them were unmanned.

02:49.565 --> 02:52.360
No living creature was harmed
when I destroyed it. But...

02:52.444 --> 02:54.195
the Skrill didn't know that.

02:54.279 --> 02:56.782
Of course not. They are vermin.

02:59.243 --> 03:01.204
They were making a path for...

03:01.288 --> 03:03.248
What's the name of the planet, Andros?

03:03.331 --> 03:06.669
Terra. Sometimes called Earth.

04:28.603 --> 04:33.108
How can you remember the native name
of every primitive planet?

04:34.193 --> 04:35.278
Earth...

04:35.361 --> 04:39.533
Earth has been part of my caseload
for a long time, Sell. I feel responsible.

04:39.825 --> 04:43.413
We appreciate that, Andros.
And the Skrill...

04:43.496 --> 04:47.752
they carry a definite danger
of contamination to the Earth creatures.

04:47.835 --> 04:49.837
They call themselves "humans. "

04:50.839 --> 04:53.842
They would. The arrogance of innocence.

04:54.969 --> 04:58.891
Well, Andros, do you think
that you can clear up this mess?

04:58.974 --> 05:00.434
Bring the Skrill back?

05:00.517 --> 05:02.644
I am prepared
to leave for Earth immediately.

05:02.728 --> 05:04.814
Perhaps you should take some assistance.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.107
That won't be necessary.

05:06.190 --> 05:09.737
There is an Earth creature with whom
my father and I have worked before.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.740
I plan on sending word to her.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.867
Without consulting us?

05:14.451 --> 05:16.245
If you knew Wonder Woman...

05:16.579 --> 05:18.831
you'd know why I've chosen her.

05:42.235 --> 05:45.698
There's no question in your mind
that whatever or whoever they are...

05:45.781 --> 05:48.618
they're coming from somewhere
outside of our solar system?

05:48.701 --> 05:50.162
None whatsoever, Steve.

05:50.245 --> 05:52.539
We picked them up
on satellite tracking relay...

05:52.622 --> 05:55.126
coming in, onward.
Past the orbit of Saturn.

05:55.209 --> 05:58.087
- Any evidence of a landing, Ruth?
- No, Diana.

05:58.171 --> 06:01.717
The spaceship seems to be homing in
on the satellite communication beam.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.138
You and George check out
that automated satellite control station...

06:05.221 --> 06:06.389
as soon as possible.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.476
As soon as possible is now, Steve.

06:08.559 --> 06:09.768
Good. Diana...

06:09.852 --> 06:13.148
we'll handle the first briefing
of the National Security Council.

06:13.231 --> 06:15.693
As soon as that's over
I'll meet George and Ruth.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.487
- Security clampdown?
- Let's button it up.

06:23.744 --> 06:27.165
The Council has decided
that your trip is unnecessary, Andros.

06:27.248 --> 06:29.084
What are you talking about?

06:29.168 --> 06:32.046
I told you earlier I was planning
to contact Wonder Woman.

06:32.129 --> 06:33.590
My spaceship is ready.

06:33.673 --> 06:36.969
It has been decided to send
a decontamination squad.

06:37.261 --> 06:39.847
And do what to Earth? To the humans?

06:40.431 --> 06:43.143
There'd be panic. Widespread psychosis.

06:43.310 --> 06:47.106
The Skrill can be cleaned out
without turning Earth into a battlefield...

06:47.190 --> 06:48.316
A madhouse.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.945
You agreed to this decision?

06:52.362 --> 06:54.032
There was discussion.

06:54.115 --> 06:55.491
Well, there should be more.

06:55.575 --> 06:59.913
I've had confirmation the Skrill are located
near the capital city of the United States.

06:59.997 --> 07:02.459
- You can pinpoint them?
- Yes.

07:03.126 --> 07:07.256
Give me a chance to recapture the Skrill
without ravaging an entire planet.

07:07.590 --> 07:11.762
I would be willing to give Andros
such a chance...

07:11.845 --> 07:13.597
if it were limited.

07:14.097 --> 07:16.392
- By setting a time limit?
- Exactly.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.439
- But that's unfair.
- Six days...

07:21.857 --> 07:25.612
Six days on Earth to recapture the Skrill.
No more.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.044
Accepted.

07:38.628 --> 07:39.837
Six days.

08:00.863 --> 08:02.866
How much farther to your station, Ruth?

08:02.949 --> 08:05.243
A couple of minutes, we'll be there.

08:06.829 --> 08:08.915
You certainly are isolated out here.

08:08.998 --> 08:12.753
We didn't want tourists stumbling
accidentally over the installation.

08:13.462 --> 08:16.507
There's nobody within 5 miles of us.

09:11.992 --> 09:13.702
That sound again.

09:14.537 --> 09:15.955
Is it birds?

09:42.863 --> 09:46.117
They're not human.
They're extraterrestrial.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.046
Welcome to our planet.

10:00.343 --> 10:02.054
They're responding.

14:18.034 --> 14:19.118
Alive.

14:34.429 --> 14:35.555
How are they?

14:35.639 --> 14:39.018
I don't know, Steve.
Dr. Rand's doing an examination now.

14:39.477 --> 14:42.272
I've ordered roadblocks.
The entire area is sealed off.

14:42.356 --> 14:44.983
I'll get back to you
as soon as I know more.

15:36.296 --> 15:37.840
They seem so drained.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.010
That's exactly the word for it, Miss Prince.

15:41.094 --> 15:43.931
There's no physical trauma,
no sign of disease.

15:45.557 --> 15:49.896
Yet there's no mental activity beyond
the minimum necessary to sustain life.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.399
In effect, they're mindless.

15:52.691 --> 15:55.278
Physically healthy. Mentally empty.

16:00.201 --> 16:03.205
I understand, this is some sort
of national security matter.

16:03.288 --> 16:06.416
But is there anything you can say
that might help in my treatment?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.211
We don't know much yet.

16:10.088 --> 16:11.255
Okay, Doctor.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.301
Something from outer space
has landed on Earth.

16:14.385 --> 16:17.097
George and Ruth went to investigate
the manifestation...

16:17.180 --> 16:19.349
and apparently,
to put it in your own words...

16:19.432 --> 16:21.310
they've lost control of their own minds.

16:21.393 --> 16:23.354
And you don't know to whom, or to what?

16:23.437 --> 16:25.273
No, Doctor, I'm sorry, I don't.

16:25.357 --> 16:29.695
But as I was walking through the woods,
I had the feeling of something alien.

16:29.779 --> 16:33.158
I heard some odd musical sounds.
Patterns.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.703
Are you saying that I'm treating
the possible victims...

16:36.787 --> 16:39.290
of someone or something
from another world?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.710
That's exactly right, Doctor.

16:56.394 --> 16:59.857
We've got the entire area cordoned off.
And all the roads are blocked.

16:59.941 --> 17:02.986
No one enters or leaves except
through one of our checkpoints.

17:03.070 --> 17:05.155
Good. What about those already
in the area?

17:05.239 --> 17:06.615
Well, that's hard to say.

17:06.698 --> 17:10.619
We do know that a busload of kids
from Barclay College went on a field trip.

17:10.703 --> 17:13.040
That should be winding up fairly soon.

17:14.625 --> 17:18.046
You don't mind me asking,
what are we looking for?

17:18.713 --> 17:21.717
- We're not exactly sure.
- Yeah, thanks.

17:22.676 --> 17:23.761
Captain...

17:25.055 --> 17:29.227
we may have an illegal alien problem,
and we don't want innocent people hurt.

17:29.477 --> 17:32.188
We have an illegal alien problem
all over the country...

17:32.271 --> 17:35.275
but we don't usually seal off an area
this big to find them.

17:35.359 --> 17:37.862
These aliens are
from outer space, Captain.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.911
These are the people running our country.

18:03.894 --> 18:06.564
Hey, you guys. I'm tired. Come on.

18:06.981 --> 18:09.234
Let's wrap it up and get out of here.

18:10.151 --> 18:11.862
Come on. Hurry on in.

18:12.822 --> 18:14.657
Hey, look! Diopsyros.

18:15.492 --> 18:17.035
Diospyros.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.249
Hey, up there. Come on down.

18:24.586 --> 18:25.796
How you doing?

18:26.380 --> 18:28.549
Come here, I found something. Look.

18:28.967 --> 18:31.844
Looks like the Virginia Sapsucker.
If I do believe.

18:31.929 --> 18:33.597
Come on. Stop it.

18:36.351 --> 18:38.353
I guess, we should be getting back, right?

18:38.436 --> 18:41.190
No, come on. It's really nice here.
Look at this.

18:41.273 --> 18:42.775
Terrific.

18:44.068 --> 18:45.153
Beautiful.

18:51.285 --> 18:52.620
What the heck?

18:57.209 --> 18:59.629
Debbie! Johnny!

19:33.837 --> 19:36.466
Debbie! Johnny!

19:55.656 --> 19:57.158
This creature...

19:57.617 --> 19:59.828
This young man is relatively weak.

20:00.495 --> 20:03.457
But a young mind can absorb information
more quickly.

20:04.917 --> 20:07.712
We shall be
far more efficient recording instruments...

20:07.796 --> 20:09.130
using these young minds.

20:09.214 --> 20:12.510
- Yes, we shall. Let us go.
- Yes.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.355
Debbie!

20:23.315 --> 20:24.566
Johnny!

20:30.824 --> 20:32.993
And now, it's beginning to thunder.

20:46.802 --> 20:47.928
It's funny.

20:48.053 --> 20:51.766
Seems like a storm and a half,
just beyond those trees.

20:56.105 --> 20:58.233
We don't seem to be affected by it.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.151
Strange weather.

21:45.916 --> 21:47.417
Blew over, I guess.

21:48.419 --> 21:49.504
Yeah.

22:01.018 --> 22:04.730
I don't know where they went.
I'm a bus driver, not a babysitter.

22:05.565 --> 22:07.025
They're over 18.

22:07.109 --> 22:09.153
If they show, tell them I had to split.

22:09.237 --> 22:12.865
We're searching the entire area,
I'm sure that we'll find them, Miss Vane.

22:12.949 --> 22:15.494
I'll send out a CB call,
I'll get some volunteers.

22:15.577 --> 22:18.832
I have to take the rest of them back
before anyone else gets lost.

22:18.915 --> 22:20.583
- Don't worry.
- Good luck.

22:22.378 --> 22:24.672
Breaker. Breaker, all CBers.

22:24.755 --> 22:28.844
This is Captain Parelli, State Police.
Vicinity: Charles Road Command Post.

22:28.927 --> 22:32.974
We're looking for a Chambers.
Deborah S. Age 19...

22:33.599 --> 22:36.812
5' 5", 108 pounds...

22:36.895 --> 22:39.607
brownish-blond hair, hazel eyes.

22:39.899 --> 22:41.526
Also, party number 2:

22:42.986 --> 22:45.447
Chambers. Jonathan R...

22:45.531 --> 22:47.116
It's those crazy kids.

22:47.534 --> 22:51.706
...age 20, 5'11 ", 150 pounds...

22:52.081 --> 22:54.125
blond hair, blue eyes.

22:54.917 --> 22:58.547
Both are missing in
the above-mentioned Charles Road...

22:58.630 --> 23:00.842
Route 5 surveillance area.

23:18.446 --> 23:21.116
Hey, hold it.

23:21.199 --> 23:22.451
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:22.535 --> 23:23.786
We're lost.

23:23.995 --> 23:27.499
Don't I know it. Smokey's jamming
the band about you two.

23:30.503 --> 23:33.131
Hey, there, Smokey Bear,
this is Laughing Man.

23:33.589 --> 23:35.259
I found your two college kids.

23:35.342 --> 23:36.802
Good. Where are you now?

23:36.885 --> 23:38.888
On the side road off ofRoute 5.

23:39.180 --> 23:41.391
I could come back as far as Charles Road.

23:41.474 --> 23:45.396
I'll meet you at the intersection
of Charles and Route 5. 10-4.

23:45.479 --> 23:48.191
Do you think you can give us
a lift out of here?

23:48.275 --> 23:51.988
Didn't you hear me? I'm taking you back
to your own buddies. Get in.

24:17.185 --> 24:19.437
I think we can operate this truck.

24:19.521 --> 24:22.775
Yeah, it's primitive theory.
Internal combustion chamber.

24:23.359 --> 24:25.404
Primitive, yet adequate.

24:50.058 --> 24:53.229
This is Diana Prince.
Intersection of Charles and Route 5.

24:53.312 --> 24:55.691
- Roger.
- There's no sign of a truck.

24:55.774 --> 24:57.109
I'm proceeding east.

24:57.192 --> 24:59.194
10-4. Keep us posted.

26:08.905 --> 26:09.990
Andros.

26:17.332 --> 26:18.458
Princess.

26:18.792 --> 26:20.420
Am I in time to be of service?

26:20.503 --> 26:23.131
As always, your timing
is excellent, Andros.

26:23.297 --> 26:26.510
I've been expecting you ever since
that dramatic weather change.

26:26.593 --> 26:28.888
I was trying to attract your attention.

26:28.972 --> 26:31.558
I had a slight problem in arranging my trip.

26:31.641 --> 26:34.061
It's a delight to see you again, Princess.

26:34.145 --> 26:36.522
Even if it is trouble
that has brought me back.

26:36.605 --> 26:37.732
Is he-

26:37.816 --> 26:39.067
Unconscious.

26:39.568 --> 26:41.612
He'll survive. A state of shock.

26:41.696 --> 26:44.740
The gauntlet can stun or kill. He's lucky.

26:45.199 --> 26:48.078
These creatures, what are they?

26:48.161 --> 26:49.371
The Skrill?

26:50.331 --> 26:53.960
A plague. A sickness, but deadly.

26:57.715 --> 27:01.052
That's the police.
We've been searching for your Skrill.

27:01.845 --> 27:04.557
They will be suspicious.
Will you vouch for me?

27:05.099 --> 27:06.976
Tell them I am one of your...

27:07.602 --> 27:09.229
- medical doctors.
- Okay.

27:27.376 --> 27:29.170
Captain, this is Dr. Andros.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.259
Call an ambulance.

27:33.718 --> 27:36.262
Let me see if I can't give you a hand.

27:55.995 --> 27:58.331
Wonder Woman.
Could you give me a hand?

28:02.712 --> 28:04.714
He'll have a slight physical reaction.

28:04.797 --> 28:06.465
I'll hold him.

28:13.016 --> 28:14.308
He'll be fine.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.194
He'll need rest, observation now.

28:23.695 --> 28:26.073
It's a good thing you got here, Doctor.

28:26.365 --> 28:28.702
- Yes.
- Would you excuse us please?

28:40.340 --> 28:42.093
The humans have this area guarded.

28:42.176 --> 28:45.139
Yes, they are primitive creatures,
easily distracted.

28:45.681 --> 28:48.559
Let's see, what was the driver's term?

28:51.146 --> 28:54.358
This is Johnny and Debbie Chambers,
calling Smokey Bear.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.489
This is Captain Parelli. Where are you?

28:59.573 --> 29:02.243
We're going east, near the edge of a cliff.

29:02.660 --> 29:04.996
That's Fisher's Point. Are you all right?

29:05.079 --> 29:06.164
Yes.

29:07.207 --> 29:10.085
Okay, hang on.
We'll be with you in a few minutes.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.422
10-4, Smokey.

29:15.092 --> 29:16.719
Okay, roll it.

30:21.965 --> 30:25.553
That's the full report that Wonder Woman
gave me on her friend, Andros.

30:25.636 --> 30:27.347
We'll all be working together on it.

30:27.431 --> 30:28.515
That's good.

30:28.599 --> 30:32.395
I still have no results on that APB
I put on those two students.

30:32.478 --> 30:35.816
Andros believes that the Skrill
have taken over Johnny and Debbie...

30:35.899 --> 30:36.984
and I agree with him.

30:37.067 --> 30:41.072
It's possible. They diverted one police
cruiser by running a truck over a cliff...

30:41.156 --> 30:43.199
and the other state patrol car was found...

30:43.283 --> 30:45.453
with troopers
in that same mindless condition.

30:45.536 --> 30:47.413
So, Skrill have escaped.

30:49.332 --> 30:51.751
- I'll get back to you, Steve.
- All right.

30:58.552 --> 30:59.678
Andros.

31:01.347 --> 31:04.142
These Skrill, what exactly is their crime?

31:04.434 --> 31:06.061
They are thieves, Princess.

31:06.145 --> 31:07.855
- Thieves?
- Let me explain.

31:08.105 --> 31:10.650
There are worlds where gold
is a base metal.

31:11.651 --> 31:15.114
I have seen a planetoid
that is a single, gigantic diamond.

31:15.614 --> 31:18.785
Conversely on Sirius 4...

31:21.621 --> 31:22.832
natural...

31:23.166 --> 31:25.877
organic wood is rare beyond price.

31:27.546 --> 31:30.174
So, what is easily sold...

31:31.467 --> 31:35.848
readily bought, simple to transport
and worth stealing?

31:38.100 --> 31:40.478
- Knowledge.
- Precisely.

31:41.688 --> 31:43.189
Human minds.

31:45.192 --> 31:49.364
The Skrill use these artificial crystals
as storage devices.

31:49.448 --> 31:53.953
They are designed to capture,
condense and store a living mind.

31:56.330 --> 32:01.087
If a mind can be stored in one of these
can it then be placed into anyone's body?

32:01.171 --> 32:04.632
Easily. Any body, biological, mechanical.

32:04.716 --> 32:06.886
That is what the Skrill sell.

32:07.469 --> 32:08.888
It's monstrous.

32:36.672 --> 32:38.591
I am Doctor George Hess.

32:38.757 --> 32:42.554
The term "doctor" refers to achievement
in a defined field of study.

32:45.474 --> 32:47.728
My current position
is With the government...

32:47.811 --> 32:49.771
in charge of radar tracking.

32:49.855 --> 32:51.857
I work with satellite scanning.

33:00.952 --> 33:04.832
The government security agency that is
investigating the spaceship landing...

33:04.915 --> 33:07.793
is the Inter Agency Defense Command.

33:07.877 --> 33:10.672
The investigation Will be
headed by Steve Trevor.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.718
His agent in the field is Diana Prince.

33:13.801 --> 33:16.762
The Skrill can drain your planet
of its true treasures.

33:16.846 --> 33:18.724
The best human minds.

33:18.807 --> 33:21.978
And sell them? Where? To who?

33:22.520 --> 33:23.771
Other cultures.

33:24.689 --> 33:28.068
There are worlds where it's quite legal
to own slave minds.

33:28.235 --> 33:30.070
For instance, on Deneb 4...

33:30.154 --> 33:32.991
they use them to operate
automated mining equipment.

33:33.074 --> 33:36.203
Or, other planets, they're pets.

33:36.412 --> 33:38.247
Interesting alien thinkers.

33:39.207 --> 33:42.252
Or they're valuable
as part of a research library.

33:42.586 --> 33:44.255
Look up "Earth," say...

33:44.756 --> 33:48.177
touch a retrieval key and a human mind...

33:49.178 --> 33:50.637
can give you information.

33:50.721 --> 33:52.807
And the Planetary Council allows this?

33:52.891 --> 33:55.351
No. It's illegal, outlawed.

33:55.435 --> 33:58.397
It is a crime to traffic in stolen minds.

33:59.899 --> 34:01.401
That's why I'm here.

34:01.902 --> 34:04.822
I can block the mind-draining with this.

34:05.907 --> 34:08.409
But I need help to find the Skrill.

34:09.911 --> 34:12.456
What I don't have is time.

34:16.127 --> 34:17.212
Hello.

34:17.295 --> 34:19.047
- Diana, We got a problem.
- Yes, Steve.

34:19.130 --> 34:22.677
The military's skeptical. They believe
something came from outer space...

34:22.761 --> 34:25.931
but they want proof that Andros
is better equipped than they are.

34:26.014 --> 34:27.766
How soon do they need it, Steve?

34:27.850 --> 34:29.268
Tomorrow, 10:00 am.

34:29.351 --> 34:31.730
All right, Steve. I'll get back to you.

34:33.899 --> 34:34.984
Andros.

34:35.568 --> 34:38.029
The military wants you to prove yourself.

34:40.282 --> 34:42.618
They will want me
to demonstrate destruction.

34:42.702 --> 34:43.870
Of course.

34:49.543 --> 34:53.840
I am willing, but only if I can use
ecologically undesirable materials.

35:07.565 --> 35:09.359
Here comes the General now.

35:23.043 --> 35:24.419
- Trevor.
- General.

35:29.383 --> 35:31.011
I have only the one device.

35:31.094 --> 35:34.390
But I can show you how to manufacture
many in less romantic forms.

35:34.474 --> 35:37.978
They can be fitted into police cars
and army helicopters.

35:39.146 --> 35:40.939
Just what do they do?

35:41.023 --> 35:43.776
When activated they can detect
the presence of Skrill...

35:43.860 --> 35:45.778
within a radius of 400 miles.

35:47.156 --> 35:50.075
To chase mind-swapping monsters
from outer space?

35:50.827 --> 35:55.124
That's a somewhat melodramatic
description, but essentially accurate.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.335
I just don't buy it.

35:58.252 --> 35:59.796
I'm sorry, Trevor.

35:59.880 --> 36:03.133
Our forces are overworked, underpaid,
and short on money.

36:03.968 --> 36:06.888
I couldn't justify spending tax dollars
on this...

36:07.346 --> 36:08.724
science fiction.

36:08.807 --> 36:10.142
General Miller...

36:10.225 --> 36:12.937
yesterday's science fiction
is today's science fact.

36:13.021 --> 36:16.317
Andros is an envoy from outer space...

36:16.650 --> 36:18.194
from the Council of Planets.

36:18.277 --> 36:22.073
I'll need some credentials, Miss Prince.

36:22.157 --> 36:23.867
I think we can give you some.

36:23.950 --> 36:26.454
We've arranged for a little demonstration.

36:27.163 --> 36:29.374
What kind of demonstration?

36:30.709 --> 36:31.877
Watch.

37:19.560 --> 37:21.980
Are you convinced, Skrill?

37:22.064 --> 37:23.148
What?

37:27.820 --> 37:29.907
We've got to get him out of here.

38:46.459 --> 38:48.419
Well, at least we've got one.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.841
Yes, Andros, you've taken one of us.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.804
Do you think you've got a chance
of taking the rest of us...

38:56.888 --> 38:58.766
using these animals?

39:20.501 --> 39:24.255
I want to go home.
What about my brother?

39:24.964 --> 39:28.552
Diana Prince is looking for your brother
right now. So are the police-

39:28.636 --> 39:29.720
I don't understand.

39:29.803 --> 39:33.224
This could be a perfectly normal teenager
who's half-scared to death.

39:33.308 --> 39:37.229
Believe me, Doctor. The girl
is being controlled by an alien mind.

39:37.313 --> 39:39.815
I don't know what's wrong
with you people.

39:39.899 --> 39:44.404
I believe in the Constitution. Which means
that before I continue this examination...

39:44.488 --> 39:48.534
either I get hold of the girl's parents
or you get hold of a court order.

39:50.913 --> 39:54.375
We wish no harm to the child,
but we cannot release the Skrill.

39:55.376 --> 39:57.086
I feel I can create a response.

39:57.170 --> 39:59.673
Please, don't let him hurt me.

40:00.841 --> 40:02.302
May I talk to Debbie?

40:02.385 --> 40:04.012
I don't want to talk.

40:04.095 --> 40:06.599
I promise you that I will not use force.

40:07.183 --> 40:08.559
Only this.

40:13.357 --> 40:15.526
Now, I command you.

40:16.194 --> 40:19.615
Tell me who you are and what you are?

40:21.033 --> 40:22.117
What?

40:28.375 --> 40:30.377
I command you to answer.

40:35.050 --> 40:36.385
I am...

40:38.262 --> 40:39.722
the Skrill.

40:39.931 --> 40:41.058
My God.

40:41.308 --> 40:44.854
Yes, fall back
on religious superstition, Doctor.

40:44.979 --> 40:48.232
First, sentimental sympathy
for a poor child...

40:48.316 --> 40:50.319
and then heaven help you.

40:51.111 --> 40:53.698
If I had your mind, Doctor, I'd shred it...

40:53.782 --> 40:56.201
or throw it out.
It wouldn't be worth the saving.

40:56.284 --> 40:57.370
Stop it.

40:58.371 --> 41:01.540
We're not interested
in your squalid prejudices, Skrill.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.544
- Where's the girl Debbie's mind?
- Answer.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.342
In the storage racks.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.553
In the place we're hiding.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.306
Is Debbie's mind all right?

41:14.390 --> 41:17.852
What there is of it. Yes, of course.

41:18.353 --> 41:19.813
It has value.

41:20.522 --> 41:22.691
She apparently attends college.

41:22.775 --> 41:25.487
Their version of so-called
higher education.

41:26.696 --> 41:28.908
I promise you, she will not be sold.

41:29.867 --> 41:31.661
Where are you hiding?

41:35.708 --> 41:36.834
Answer him.

41:38.294 --> 41:40.964
We are hiding in the wilderness.

41:41.757 --> 41:43.175
In the woods.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.516
I can't think of the exact place.

41:49.934 --> 41:52.228
She is telling the truth.

41:52.311 --> 41:55.649
The topography on the planet
she comes from is different from yours.

41:55.732 --> 41:58.319
Also the terms for distance and direction.

41:58.861 --> 42:01.113
But we know they are hiding in this area.

42:01.198 --> 42:02.824
I'm pulling out all the stops.

42:02.908 --> 42:07.080
We'll cover the perimeter, use choppers,
and coordinate with ground forces.

42:09.123 --> 42:11.126
We'll find them, Andros, relax.

42:12.086 --> 42:13.212
"Relax. "

42:13.462 --> 42:15.799
We can do no more tonight.

42:32.861 --> 42:35.281
Unquestionably the same human.

42:39.327 --> 42:42.456
In the persona of Diana Prince,
she is vulnerable.

42:48.964 --> 42:52.761
I do believe that the Sardor
will be quite effective.

42:53.136 --> 42:54.513
And with this...

42:56.682 --> 42:58.392
he will even be more so.

43:02.022 --> 43:05.068
Earth people have something
known as catnip...

43:06.110 --> 43:09.823
which is the equivalent to,
I guess one would say...

43:10.115 --> 43:11.784
Sardornip.

43:15.830 --> 43:19.126
He will seek it out wherever it is placed.

43:20.961 --> 43:25.092
It will excite him and he will tear
Wonder Woman apart.

43:36.397 --> 43:37.941
Easy, Sardor.

43:40.819 --> 43:42.780
Beautiful.

43:43.990 --> 43:46.243
We are on this Earth but a short time.

43:46.409 --> 43:49.288
But those we leave behind
will remember the Skrill.

43:52.209 --> 43:53.502
Take it.

44:14.402 --> 44:16.488
May I help you, girls?

44:17.280 --> 44:19.951
- We're going to visit a friend.
- Diana Prince.

44:20.034 --> 44:23.956
She isn't home right now and it will be
several hours before she gets home.

44:24.039 --> 44:26.751
That's all right.
We thought we'd wait for her.

44:26.834 --> 44:29.420
Girls, I'm sorry,
but she didn't mention it to me.

44:29.504 --> 44:32.299
It's to be a surprise,
we have a present for her.

44:32.925 --> 44:36.554
Since it's her birthday, we thought
you might be nice enough to let us in.

44:36.638 --> 44:37.889
Birthday, huh?

44:38.139 --> 44:41.352
Well, under the circumstances,
I suppose it's all right.

44:41.936 --> 44:46.358
Be sure to tell her I wish her
a happy birthday.

44:46.441 --> 44:48.486
- We will.
- Have fun.

46:00.991 --> 46:02.159
Who are you?

46:02.243 --> 46:05.622
Hi, I'm Kim, and that's my sister Karen.

46:06.414 --> 46:08.918
We've got something for you, Miss Prince.

46:09.335 --> 46:10.419
Skrill!

47:14.081 --> 47:16.083
Good, we have her.

48:10.108 --> 48:11.359
