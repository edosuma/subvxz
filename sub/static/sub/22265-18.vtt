Allow me to make an introduction,
Mr. Ketch. Meet the archangel Gabriel.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.303
5AM: Mom is trapped in another reality.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.705
0457751 .' We needed a
spell
to open the n'ﬁ‘.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.661
We stealth in, we get Mom,
we get Jack. Boom. Family reunion.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.639
I understand you may need
an archangel for a spell.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.429

01:03.120 --> 01:05.338
You do know where we are, don't you?

01:07.600 --> 01:11.104
Because, not to be a nag,
but we've only got 24 hours before...

01:11.200 --> 01:13.259
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me a minute.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.303
...the rift closes.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.464
Look, we just got spin-cycled
through space and time, okay?

01:19.600 --> 01:23.058
And, yes this is different
than my last drop-by.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.346
And what's this "we" crap? Hmm?

01:26.480 --> 01:30.940
You came here to save yourself,
so go save yourself. Somewhere else.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.143
Actually, I thought I could help.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.820
- What?
- Find the boy and your mother.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.778
If she's in danger, I owe her that.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.261
If she sees you,
she'll probably kill you. Again.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.439
Perhaps, but you don't know
where you are,

01:51.520 --> 01:53.067
or what's out there, or even...

01:55.360 --> 01:56.497
You get the picture.

01:58.120 --> 02:01.180
Would having a little bit of back-up
really be so bad?

02:13.760 --> 02:16.467
Well, this is quite
the vacation spot, isn't it?

02:16.560 --> 02:20.621
Yeah, if you had your heart set
on Mai Tais, well, sorry.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.386
Down, down, down, down. Get down.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.103
- Is this everyone?
- Yes, Commander.

03:48.840 --> 03:52.822
I know you.
You're not the usual human scum.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.743
Not the slickest hook-up line,
Captain Charm.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.338
You're with the Resistance.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.828

Oh, he's with Ketch, so he's not alone.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.225
Because that makes it so much better.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.380
Cass, he wanted to go solo.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.343
- And you let him?
- I... (SIGHS)

04:43.040 --> 04:44.701
He didn't give me much of a choice.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.099
Anyways, Dean's right, as long as
he's over there and we're here,

04:48.200 --> 04:50.839
we need to be taking care of Gabriel.
Getting him right again.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.466
Gabriel? (MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY)

05:02.000 --> 05:03.900
You didn't tell me it was this bad.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.819
Yeah. Well, years of isolation
and torture,

05:06.920 --> 05:09.263
and Asmodeus draining his grace.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.742
Come here. Help me out.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.546
Gabriel, it's Sam Winchester.
Remember me?

05:37.480 --> 05:38.504
I don't think he does.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.424
Remember the video you sent
to my brother, Dean Winchester, and me

05:44.520 --> 05:47.227
after you supposedly died?

05:48.320 --> 05:50.743
You told us how to stuff
Lucifer back in the cage.

SAM: I know he doesn't.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.259
I'm just trying to see if anything's
going on in his head.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.062
All right, well...

06:07.280 --> 06:08.497
Gabriel's grace.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.105
Ketch brought it.
Maybe, if he's juiced up, it'll help.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.861
- All right.
-(GABRIEL GROANING)

06:20.600 --> 06:23.182
Sam, I don't think he's gonna open up

A technique for feeding
recalcitrant children.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.545

Right. Out. Look, Jo, uh,
you got a pretty sweet deal going here,

07:02.320 --> 07:06.142
so you might wanna, I don't know,
pitch in, drop the attitude,

07:06.920 --> 07:08.023
stay by my side.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.857
Play strip poker?

07:13.920 --> 07:16.866
Shouldn't you be out
doing kingly things?

On the throne.
Available to be worshiped.

07:30.920 --> 07:35.983
We came here to change things.
Make Heaven better, help the angels.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.543
Duma. Perfect timing.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.028
Okay, I have a question for you,

07:41.120 --> 07:42.621
and I want you
to be straight with me, okay?

07:43.680 --> 07:47.559
Don't you think Jo
should show a little bit more enthusiasm

07:48.120 --> 07:52.386
for being,
for want of a better word, First Lady?

07:53.600 --> 07:56.342
Pull her weight little bit?

07:56.880 --> 07:59.542
Keep me happy little bit?

08:01.640 --> 08:04.382
Couples' issues aren't my area.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.540
So, that's a yes, okay?

08:10.480 --> 08:13.062
So, you're here with breaking news
about my son. Go.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.103
The few angels that we could spare
are scanning the planet,

08:16.200 --> 08:17.417
but so far, nothing.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.624
Well, you know, he's a priority, so...

08:22.960 --> 08:24.177
We don't have the manpower.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.182
He's a priority.

Of course.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.457
Wow.

08:39.160 --> 08:41.537
They would never
treat my old man that way.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.829
Even

08:42.920 --> 08:46.185
If he said, "Scour the Earth,"
they'd say, "SOS or Brillo?"

08:46.280 --> 08:51.183
Yeah, well, you're not him.
Your father created. You inherited.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.145
Yeah? Well, I'm the one
on the throne right now,

08:53.240 --> 08:55.105

gonna treat me that way, okay?

Well, before all of us
start treating you like God,

09:00.720 --> 09:02.540
you might try acting like God.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.826
Just a thought.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.868
This is unacceptable.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.179

he could fly under the radar,

09:17.280 --> 09:20.659

09:57.280 --> 09:58.986

09:59.720 --> 10:03.747
You know, the art of infiltrating
a hostile and unfamiliar environment

10:03.840 --> 10:06.104
whilst remaining undetected.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.657
Hence, free. Hence effective.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.866

the "bull in a china shop" technique.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.825
No, I prefer the "let's find Charlie

10:13.920 --> 10:15.945
"before the angels
turn her inside-out" technique.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.259
Remind me again why we're risking
everything to find this girl.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.057
Because she's seen my Mom.
She's seen Jack. We need her.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.185
And you're sure
that's what this is about.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.180
You're sure it's not personal.

No time. We gotta go now. Go!

32:08.480 --> 32:09.663
(GROANING)

32:13.240 --> 32:15.549
All right, I did what I could do
with the bunker's warding,

32:15.640 --> 32:17.221
but who knows if it's enough.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.300
- How is he?

for the likes of me, Samuel.

You know too well what I can do to you.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.377

there's another world.

And it has another me?

36:01.080 --> 36:02.104
DEAN: Uh, had.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.422
And you were friends with her. Me? Her?

36:06.600 --> 36:07.919
Yes, very.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.063
How Very?

36:11.400 --> 36:12.617
She was into chicks.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.023
Oh.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.857
I like her.

a lot Of information,

36:17.360 --> 36:18.577
everything I'm telling you, Okay?

36:19.800 --> 36:21.745
But, we're running outta time here.
I need to know where the Nephilim is.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.183
Jack. And my Mom's with him, right?

36:24.440 --> 36:26.465
- Your mom?
- Yes. She's from our world, too.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.159
Uh... (SCOFFS)

36:28.240 --> 36:30.583
Last I heard, they were
fighting somewhere in

what remains of Dayton, Ohio,
but I don't...

- Wait. Your mom?
- Yeah.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.439
(SCOFFS)
Why would I believe any of this?

36:39.120 --> 36:40.189
Because of that.

Wow.

GABRIEL: Whoa. (STU'I'I'ERS)

36:49.720 --> 36:51.187

-(GROANS)
- CASTIEL: And there's more.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.937
Michael wants to come to this Earth
and destroy it

37:01.040 --> 37:03.144
and we may need your help to fight him.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.827
- What?
- Yeah. (CHUCKLES SOFI'LY)

37:08.280 --> 37:09.668
Welcome to the team.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.784
Uh, yeah. Not so much.

37:15.320 --> 37:20.587
I mean, thank you for the rescue,
and for the redemption arc,

37:20.840 --> 37:24.185
but, uh, I'm not really a "team" guy.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.824
So, I'm gonna bounce, okay?

37:28.200 --> 37:31.465
Um, but, you know, it's been, um...

37:31.600 --> 37:33.181
What's the opposite of fun?

37:33.960 --> 37:34.949
That.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.583
No, Gabriel, don't...
You can't just walk away.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.580
If Michael comes here,
he will end this world.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.786
And the last time the world was ending,
I put my money on you.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.181
I think you can pull it off again.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.509
CASTIEL: N0.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.505
You cannot turn your back on
your father's creation.

37:56.040 --> 38:00.261
Castiel, my father turned his back
on his creation.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.319
Guess it just runs in the family.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.137
No, Gabriel. Please.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.542
(CRACKLING)

38:21.080 --> 38:24.345
Okay, this thing's gonna be closing
any minute. We gotta get it going.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.702
MR. KETCH: Dean, you need tO go through.

38:25.800 --> 38:30.419
Bring back Sam, and your angel,
and Gabriel, and the bloody Navy Seals.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.862
Whatever help you can get.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.979
- But I should stay.
- Wait, what?

38:35.200 --> 38:37.464
If we're going up against Michael,
we need to be ready.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.939
We need to know what he's up to,
where your mother and Jack are.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.079
I'm staying, too.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.309
Are you kidding me?

38:45.400 --> 38:47.140
You got Michael and
a billion angels on your ass.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.986
Dude, this is my home.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.821
My friends are here
and they're in trouble.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.026
If you really do have a way to take
down Michael, get back here and do it.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.739
Until then, this is my fight.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.719
I don't wanna lose you again.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.382
That's not your call.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.737
Dean, it's closing.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.507
(CRACKLING)

39:28.880 --> 39:29.983
Go.

39:34.520 --> 39:38.069
-(DEAN GRUNTING)
- Dean. Dean. Hey, hey.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.229
- You're hurt.
- NO, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.068
SAM: Hey, the rift, it's...

39:44.080 --> 39:46.184
Where's Mom? Where's Jack?

39:46.920 --> 39:48.626
(PANTING)

39:49.440 --> 39:53.865
Long story. So Mom and the kid,
they're not with Michael anymore.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.099
Ketch and Charlie just stayed back
to try to find them.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.619
There's a Charlie over there.
She kicks ass.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.184
To... Uh, Charlie Bradbury?

40:01.760 --> 40:02.784
Yeah.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.239
What's this?
(STU'I'I'ERS) What... What did I miss?

40:06.840 --> 40:09.582
It was a demon incursion
led by Asmodeus.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.547
Sorry, Asmodeus got in here?

40:11.640 --> 40:13.949
(STU'I'I'ERS) Yeah, and Gabriel killed him.

40:14.440 --> 40:15.577
Gabriel?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.583
Well, that's great. SO he's back.
Where is he?

40:21.600 --> 40:22.624
CASTIEL: He just left.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.022
What do you mean, he left?

40:27.520 --> 40:28.589
(STUTrERS)

40:28.960 --> 40:32.737
We asked Gabriel tO help us and...

40:34.040 --> 40:35.257
And he said no.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.862
He doesn't get to say no.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.106
We still have his grace, though, right?

40:42.760 --> 40:43.977
Sam?

40:45.040 --> 40:46.462
Uh...

40:46.560 --> 40:49.381
(STU'I'I'ERS)
We used his grace to heal him.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.119
So it's gone. It's all gone.

40:55.360 --> 40:59.342
So if it's gone, then that means that
we can't Open that door again.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.399
If we can't open the door,
then I should have never come back!

41:12.440 --> 41:13.543
(YELLS) Son of a bitch!

41:22.760 --> 41:25.581
Every time we get close,

41:26.800 --> 41:28.301
it always falls apart.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.587
Every freaking time.

41:34.840 --> 41:35.909
Dean,

41:37.560 --> 41:39.346
we will find Gabriel.

41:41.680 --> 41:42.863
We will.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.617
We'd better.
