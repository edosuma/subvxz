__

00:06.580 --> 00:08.830
<i>I think you intend</i>
<i>to return to that beach,</i>

00:08.882 --> 00:11.082
<i>and seize every last ounce</i>
<i>of gold off of it,</i>

00:11.134 --> 00:13.501
and I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

00:13.553 --> 00:17.722
I have committed men and resources
to aid you in retrieving the Urca gold,

00:17.757 --> 00:19.340
<i>in exchange for which</i>
<i>you assured me,</i>

00:19.392 --> 00:21.142
<i>expelling Captain Vane</i>
<i>from that fort.</i>

00:21.177 --> 00:22.177
<i>We'll procure a ship,</i>

00:22.229 --> 00:23.428
we'll recruit men,

00:23.480 --> 00:25.897
<i>and we'll create from nothing,</i>
<i>a new crew.</i>

00:25.932 --> 00:27.315
<i>You asked for better captains.</i>

00:27.350 --> 00:28.933
<i>I give you Captain Jack Rackham.</i>

00:28.985 --> 00:30.435
<i>I can't be your wife, Jack.</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:31.687
You and I are gonna be partners

00:31.688 --> 00:33.688
<i>till they put us in the ground.</i>

00:33.690 --> 00:35.440
<i>That is the crown jewel taken</i>

00:35.492 --> 00:37.275
<i>from the good fortune prize.</i>

00:37.327 --> 00:39.027
Her father's Lord Peter Ashe,

00:39.029 --> 00:40.778
<i>governor of the Carolina Colony.</i>

00:40.830 --> 00:42.997
Her father is a very influential man,

00:43.033 --> 00:44.415
<i>he and I were friends.</i>

00:44.451 --> 00:45.783
<i>When you return her</i>
<i>to her father,</i>

00:45.835 --> 00:46.918
<i>you're going to explain</i>

00:46.953 --> 00:48.703
what it is you're trying
to accomplish here.

00:48.705 --> 00:50.505
<i>A Nassau that can self-govern.</i>

00:50.540 --> 00:52.040
You are no longer a hostage.

00:52.042 --> 00:53.341
I'm gonna get you out of here.

00:53.376 --> 00:56.794
You will turn on absolutely
anyone, won't you?

00:56.846 --> 00:57.886
<i>Listen to me clearly.</i>

00:57.931 --> 01:00.098
<i>You will hear from me again.</i>

01:00.133 --> 01:01.933
You think there's something
valuable enough to make

01:01.968 --> 01:04.769
the British Navy forget that
you and I are pirates?

01:04.804 --> 01:06.387
Not what, who.

01:06.389 --> 01:08.723
<i>This is Eleanor Guthrie,</i>
<i>the trade boss in Nassau.</i>

01:08.775 --> 01:10.558
Imagine sir,
how London would react

01:10.610 --> 01:12.860
to the arrival
of the queen of thieves.

01:12.896 --> 01:14.228
I am so very sorry for what...

01:14.281 --> 01:16.731
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda...

01:16.733 --> 01:19.033
<i>I want to see that</i>
<i>noose around your neck,</i>

01:19.069 --> 01:20.190
<i>and I want to pull the lever</i>

01:20.203 --> 01:22.370
with my own two ha...!

01:22.405 --> 01:24.572
<i>I have placed</i>
<i>Captain Flint under arrest!</i>

01:24.624 --> 01:27.458
<i>His trial will be swift and final!</i>

01:27.494 --> 01:29.544
Flint stole from me,
and I'm making it right.

01:29.579 --> 01:32.163
<i>You hate Flint, I hate Flint.</i>

01:32.215 --> 01:35.083
But right now, he's talking
about how we survive,

01:35.135 --> 01:36.217
what comes next.

01:36.252 --> 01:39.003
I suggest we get him
the hell out of there.

01:39.055 --> 01:41.089
Everyone is a monster to someone.

01:41.091 --> 01:43.391
<i>Since you are so convinced</i>
<i>that I am yours,</i>

01:43.426 --> 01:44.726
I will be it.

01:44.761 --> 01:46.227
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:46.262 --> 01:48.596
Figured if anyone was going
to make a trophy of you,

01:48.648 --> 01:49.931
<i>it really ought to be me.</i>

01:55.071 --> 01:58.773
Her word
will be the last word for this place.

01:59.659 --> 02:01.442
<i>My men will need</i>
<i>to lean on something solid.</i>

02:01.494 --> 02:02.777
<i>They look to me for that,</i>

02:02.779 --> 02:05.530
but they'll also look
to their new quartermaster.

02:05.582 --> 02:07.415
There's something you ought to know,

02:07.450 --> 02:11.619
<i>before my misfortune at</i>
<i>the hands of Vane's leftenants,</i>

02:11.621 --> 02:14.205
<i>our friend, the scout,</i>
<i>confessed something to me.</i>

02:14.257 --> 02:16.541
<i>He told me that he could</i>
<i>sell the gold's location</i>

02:16.593 --> 02:20.345
<i>to another crew in exchange</i>
<i>for a larger share of the prize.</i>

There are men here to see...

04:06.736 --> 04:08.369
May I help you?

04:10.073 --> 04:11.405
You're Drummond.

04:13.076 --> 04:15.293
Mary's your wife.

04:15.328 --> 04:18.745
<i>Mary's our sister.</i>

04:18.748 --> 04:22.250
Caleb, Tom, and...

04:23.920 --> 04:26.754
- Edgar.
- Edgar, that's right.

04:26.756 --> 04:30.758
And you came all the way
from Williamsburg

04:30.760 --> 04:32.510
just to be upset with me?

04:32.562 --> 04:35.096
We came from Williamsburg

04:35.148 --> 04:38.349
to make sure that you
honored your vows to her.

04:38.401 --> 04:42.854
End of today, either you're gonna
be her current husband

04:42.906 --> 04:44.605
or her late one.

04:46.442 --> 04:51.112
I'm sorry, but, um, there's
someplace I have to be.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.666
You're coming with us.

04:57.036 --> 04:59.370
<i>I understand your anger,</i>

04:59.422 --> 05:00.705
<i>but I've lived long enough</i>

05:00.757 --> 05:04.125
to know that any promise made

05:04.177 --> 05:07.261
beside the word "forever"

05:07.297 --> 05:11.182
<i>is no more than a lie agreed upon.</i>

05:11.217 --> 05:13.184
<i>There is no forever.</i>

05:13.219 --> 05:17.355
Everything moves towards its end.

05:17.390 --> 05:21.309
And the closer we get to ours,
the louder that clock ticks,

05:21.311 --> 05:23.778
<i>the less a sane man</i>
<i>would let a promise</i>

05:23.813 --> 05:25.479
<i>deprive him of happiness.</i>

05:25.481 --> 05:29.233
I explained all this to Mary,

05:29.285 --> 05:30.818
who told me she understood

05:30.870 --> 05:34.405
and that she would not
protest our separation.

05:34.457 --> 05:37.625
Are you calling my sister a liar?

05:40.463 --> 05:42.246
Well...

05:42.298 --> 05:44.999
you're here.

05:45.051 --> 05:47.218
I can think of at least three lies

05:47.253 --> 05:50.137
she must have told you
to bring that about.

05:50.173 --> 05:53.507
<i>First, I imagine she told you</i>

05:53.509 --> 05:55.593
<i>I retired from a prosperous trade</i>

05:55.645 --> 05:57.678
<i>to settle with her here.</i>

05:57.730 --> 06:00.514
But what she likely did not mention

06:00.516 --> 06:03.568
is that that trade
was high seas piracy.

06:04.878 --> 06:07.745
<i>Second, she told you</i>
<i>my name was Drummond,</i>

06:07.747 --> 06:11.749
but when I plied that trade,

06:11.801 --> 06:14.635
I was called Teach.

06:15.805 --> 06:17.338
<i>And third,</i>

06:17.390 --> 06:21.142
she clearly led you to believe

06:21.177 --> 06:25.847
that you could point your sword
in my direction

06:26.599 --> 06:30.234
<i>and survive the experience.</i>

06:37.777 --> 06:42.113
This, too, was something
less than the truth.

07:11.778 --> 07:14.946
<i>Nassau awaits.</i>

07:14.981 --> 07:17.481
Let us away.

09:14.734 --> 09:16.767
I said, "Who goes there?"

10:47.360 --> 10:50.494
You are the magistrate here.

10:50.530 --> 10:52.696
Hazzard.

10:52.749 --> 10:56.033
Bridgetown, St. Kitts,

10:56.035 --> 10:59.537
Martinique, Nevis...

10:59.539 --> 11:03.424
their magistrates
hanged men for piracy.

11:03.459 --> 11:06.710
They all receive visits from me.

11:06.712 --> 11:09.713
The word went forth...

11:09.715 --> 11:12.383
any capital sentence
served against a pirate

11:12.435 --> 11:15.719
would hear my answer.

11:15.772 --> 11:20.391
You must'a known. You must'a heard.

11:20.393 --> 11:25.196
And yet you chose to hang
those three men in your square.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.900
Why?

11:29.952 --> 11:31.902
If I didn't...

11:34.073 --> 11:39.376
if I let my fear of you
prevent me from enforcing the law,

11:39.412 --> 11:42.079
then civilization in this place is dead.

11:43.749 --> 11:48.502
I also know that most
of those other magistrates you visited,

11:48.554 --> 11:53.474
they were corrupt men, dishonest men.

11:53.509 --> 11:56.393
<i>I wagered that despite</i>
<i>all I'd heard about you,</i>

11:56.429 --> 11:58.813
<i>your mercilessness, your cruelty,</i>

11:58.848 --> 12:01.899
that you could tell the difference.

12:01.934 --> 12:03.484
That you could see
I was an honest man.

12:03.519 --> 12:05.486
<i>No!</i>

12:06.772 --> 12:09.940
No, no, no.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.495
No!

12:45.945 --> 12:48.112
<i>Keep 'em coming!</i>

12:48.114 --> 12:50.081
<i>Throw down a rope!</i>

12:50.116 --> 12:52.049
<i>We need it to pull up plunder!</i>

12:52.835 --> 12:54.752
<i>Keep movin' up</i>
<i>the decks, down below.</i>

12:59.542 --> 13:01.342
<i>How many more you got comin' up?</i>

13:01.377 --> 13:02.793
<i>Another three.</i>

13:03.379 --> 13:04.512
Is it done?

13:06.632 --> 13:07.798
It is.

13:07.850 --> 13:11.135
Once the plunder is stowed,
get us underway.

13:11.187 --> 13:12.770
Every man to his charge.

13:12.805 --> 13:14.805
Looks like we garnered
a good haul out of it.

13:14.807 --> 13:16.440
<i>Get everything into the hold.</i>

13:16.476 --> 13:18.275
The men did well
under the circumstances.

13:18.311 --> 13:19.810
Not all of them.

13:21.731 --> 13:25.483
Lost his nerve.
I want him replaced on the Vanguard

13:25.485 --> 13:27.451
before we go over the side again.

13:27.487 --> 13:29.320
He lost his footing.

13:29.322 --> 13:31.572
I don't think it had anything to do
with his nerve.

13:31.624 --> 13:33.741
Replace him.

13:37.046 --> 13:38.913
He's getting worse.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.715
He's fine.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.166
Are you sure about that?

13:42.168 --> 13:43.834
We just faced a band
of colonial regulars out there.

13:43.886 --> 13:45.169
He's entitled to a mood.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.944
Is it her?

14:09.996 --> 14:12.696
It's her.
Right where she's supposed to be.

14:17.253 --> 14:19.837
Bring us alongside.

14:19.872 --> 14:22.706
Spread your sheets!
Stand ready with grapples!

14:22.759 --> 14:24.508
<i>Spread the sheets!</i>

14:24.544 --> 14:25.793
<i>Ready the grapples!</i>

14:27.504 --> 14:29.024
<i>His men are jumping ship.</i>

14:29.048 --> 14:31.515
They aren't his men.

14:31.551 --> 14:33.768
They're his cargo.

14:33.803 --> 14:37.104
When Jack asked me to hunt her,

14:37.140 --> 14:38.939
he said she was hauling timber.

14:38.975 --> 14:41.725
He said the supplies were badly needed
for fort repairs.

14:43.062 --> 14:45.062
Funny...

14:45.114 --> 14:47.865
I don't remember him
saying anything about slaves.

If you knew that,

different choices today.

16:32.922 --> 16:36.507
<i>The evidence has been delivered.</i>

16:36.509 --> 16:38.592
<i>The accused has been measured.</i>

16:40.346 --> 16:42.396
<i>Now let us talk about judgment.</i>

16:44.350 --> 16:47.851
Miss Guthrie, do you have
anything to say in your defense

16:47.853 --> 16:51.489
before sentence is pronounced?

16:51.490 --> 16:53.281
I have but one regret...

16:55.013 --> 16:57.094
<i>...that though the pirates of Nassau</i>

16:57.146 --> 16:59.396
<i>filled my purse with coin,</i>

16:59.431 --> 17:01.682
I never took the opportunity

17:01.734 --> 17:03.817
to let them fill me with anything else.

17:08.941 --> 17:11.608
<i>- I apologize.</i>
<i>- Miss Guthrie...</i>

17:11.609 --> 17:14.694
This must seem in such
poor taste to you.

17:14.747 --> 17:16.863
I assume this is your production.

17:16.915 --> 17:20.000
Were the world as I wished it,
news of Eleanor's trial would be received

17:20.035 --> 17:24.121
with the gravity due to someone
who did so much for this place.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.123
They are who they are,

17:26.125 --> 17:28.675
and someone must provide them
with the things they need.

17:28.711 --> 17:30.511
Right now, this is what they need.

17:30.563 --> 17:34.765
<i>...found guilty of these</i>
<i>and countless other crimes</i>

17:34.817 --> 17:38.152
for which the sentence...

17:38.187 --> 17:39.820
is death.

17:52.868 --> 17:54.701
Any news from London?

17:54.753 --> 17:57.421
The trial is set to begin
sometime next week.

17:57.456 --> 17:59.122
The spectacle around it
is said to be so great,

17:59.175 --> 18:01.291
the king himself
receives daily updates.

18:01.293 --> 18:04.962
Hmm. With that much attention
on the politics in play,

18:05.014 --> 18:06.129
do you believe there is any way

18:06.182 --> 18:08.632
she will be offered
some sort of clemency?

18:08.634 --> 18:10.767
I would think there is
always a chance for mercy

18:10.803 --> 18:13.136
for one willing to beg for it.

18:30.155 --> 18:33.373
But I do not imagine
you came to see our play.

18:33.409 --> 18:35.492
What is it I can do for you?

18:35.494 --> 18:38.962
When Captains Flint and Rackham
made their pact those months ago,

18:38.998 --> 18:42.165
settled their differences over
the possession of the Urca gold,

18:42.218 --> 18:45.335
they asked me to oversee
the restoration of the fort.

18:45.387 --> 18:47.054
To ensure Nassau was protected.

18:47.089 --> 18:50.173
But without the men to do the
work, there is no progress.

18:50.175 --> 18:52.743
The fort remains compromised
and we are all exposed.

18:52.795 --> 18:55.229
<i>And since Captain Vernon's
crew walked off the site,</i>

18:55.264 --> 18:57.598
<i>there's been little to no
labor provided to me at all.</i>

18:57.650 --> 18:59.933
It's only been a few days.

18:59.985 --> 19:01.134
Give him a break.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.853
It's been two weeks.

19:08.494 --> 19:10.427
You wanted to replace Eleanor.

19:10.479 --> 19:12.112
She was the one Nassau relied upon

19:12.164 --> 19:16.166
to solve those problems
no one else could or would.

19:16.201 --> 19:19.119
I hope for all our sakes
you are up to the task.

19:24.927 --> 19:27.678
- He said he would see this done.
- I know.

19:27.713 --> 19:31.848
He assured everyone he would be
responsible for restoring the fort.

19:31.884 --> 19:34.418
The street comes to me with the
problems it cannot solve for itself,

19:34.453 --> 19:36.536
and right now Jack
is first among them.

19:36.538 --> 19:38.588
I know.

19:40.876 --> 19:43.010
Fuck's sake. I'll go talk to him.

20:12.827 --> 20:14.832
__

20:47.993 --> 20:49.776
Thank you, Celeste.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.666
I have no notes.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.873
Fuckin' leeches down there.

21:02.925 --> 21:04.958
You ain't careful, they're
gonna bleed you dry.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.927
What man wouldn't,
given the opportunity,

21:06.962 --> 21:09.046
purchase the adoration
of the masses

21:09.098 --> 21:10.630
when the cost is so small?

21:10.632 --> 21:12.466
That mess is costing you
100 pound a day.

21:12.518 --> 21:15.135
Well, in about 800 years,
you'll be able to say, "I told you so."

21:15.187 --> 21:17.938
In the meantime, perhaps we
might at least enjoy ourselves.

21:17.973 --> 21:19.556
Why ain't there anyone
up at the fort?

21:20.975 --> 21:23.455
I'd like to thank you for at least
allowing me to finish wiping

21:23.479 --> 21:25.062
before starting that song.

21:25.114 --> 21:28.065
It's been two weeks.
What you waiting for?

21:28.117 --> 21:29.866
- I'm working on it.
- Are you?

21:29.902 --> 21:32.702
'Cause it sure as shit don't look like
you're working on anything here.

21:32.704 --> 21:34.154
Well, you should spend more time here.

21:34.206 --> 21:38.158
- It's a process.
- I'm not fuckin' around. I need to know.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.459
Do you need to know
or does your husband?

21:39.495 --> 21:41.044
You know I hate it
when you call her that.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.830
Course I do.
That's why I call her that.

21:43.832 --> 21:45.499
She's got a right to be angry.

21:45.551 --> 21:47.334
Her share of the gold
is sitting up there,

21:47.336 --> 21:49.336
- along with mine.
- And mine.

21:49.388 --> 21:50.754
Please, relay to whom you must,

21:50.806 --> 21:53.390
Jack Rackham is not lazy.
Jack Rackham is not stupid.

21:53.425 --> 21:54.825
Jack Rackham is not blind.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.143
And Jack Rackham is not
unaware that currently

21:56.178 --> 21:57.778
there are no men
working on that fort.

21:57.830 --> 22:00.147
That said, on the list
of people on this island

22:00.182 --> 22:02.566
who are most concerned with
seeing that fort restored,

22:02.601 --> 22:04.184
there is everyone else,
and then there is one name

22:04.236 --> 22:07.270
that's... that's way at the top of it.

22:09.608 --> 22:10.857
- Jack Rackham.
- Yeah.

22:10.909 --> 22:12.109
Jack Rackham, exactly.

22:12.161 --> 22:13.527
Don't treat me like I'm someone else.

22:13.529 --> 22:15.612
I'm on your fucking side of this,

22:15.664 --> 22:17.747
same as I've always been.

22:17.783 --> 22:21.034
I am just asking you
to tell me what the plan is.

22:21.036 --> 22:22.702
Jack!

22:26.592 --> 22:28.708
You're about to find out.

23:01.877 --> 23:04.578
Your days of approaching
unannounced are behind you.

23:07.916 --> 23:11.585
I reassigned Mr. Dobbs
off the Vanguard, as you asked.

23:11.637 --> 23:12.969
I told him his skill in the rig

23:13.005 --> 23:15.839
was too valuable to risk
putting him in harm's way.

23:15.891 --> 23:18.642
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:18.677 --> 23:19.976
Then now that that's sorted,

23:20.012 --> 23:21.692
there is another replacement
on the Vanguard

23:21.693 --> 23:23.630
that we should discuss.

23:23.631 --> 23:24.764
Who's that?

23:25.616 --> 23:27.566
You.

23:27.568 --> 23:29.402
Is that so?

23:29.438 --> 23:33.106
<i>I understand we faced colonial
regulars out there last night.</i>

23:33.108 --> 23:34.824
So?

23:35.060 --> 23:36.893
These raids were difficult enough

23:36.945 --> 23:39.779
when the element of
surprise was in our favor.

23:39.815 --> 23:42.816
But now?
Now it would seem your days

23:42.868 --> 23:46.653
of approaching unannounced
may also be at an end.

23:48.039 --> 23:49.539
<i>Every time you go ashore,</i>

23:49.574 --> 23:52.292
<i>there is a risk you don't return...</i>

23:52.327 --> 23:55.662
<i>a risk Nassau loses</i>
<i>its most recognizable figure</i>

23:55.714 --> 23:58.715
<i>and a risk that would seem</i>
<i>to be escalating.</i>

23:58.750 --> 24:02.752
I am suggesting it's time we take
you out of harm's way as well.

24:02.804 --> 24:06.506
We're fighting a war
to protect Nassau.

24:06.558 --> 24:09.309
A war in which our most
effective weapon

24:09.344 --> 24:12.395
is the fear that we can
instill in our enemies.

24:12.431 --> 24:15.682
<i>We've succeeded</i>
<i>in making Captain Flint</i>

24:15.734 --> 24:19.853
the name of grim death
to all of them.

24:19.905 --> 24:22.739
The only way that we can ensure
that that story continues

24:22.774 --> 24:25.024
is if he is the one telling it.

24:25.076 --> 24:28.411
That story is telling
itself, and you know it.

24:28.447 --> 24:31.531
We've been assigned responsibility
for raids we were nowhere near.

24:31.533 --> 24:33.199
Jesus, I've been given credit

24:33.251 --> 24:35.118
for having been
a part of some of them.

24:35.170 --> 24:38.538
They are so terrified of you,
they're terrified of me.

24:38.590 --> 24:40.540
You think that's a reason
we should relent?

24:40.592 --> 24:42.876
Who the fuck said anything
about relenting?

24:42.928 --> 24:44.794
Look, I am talking about
letting someone else

24:44.846 --> 24:46.346
stand in and play
your role now and again.

24:46.381 --> 24:49.098
Thank you for your concern,

24:49.134 --> 24:53.269
but I'll decide when it's time
to start altering our tactics.

24:53.305 --> 24:56.806
No, I'll decide.

24:56.858 --> 24:59.142
This crew has spilled
a great deal of blood

24:59.194 --> 25:01.778
to make your name what it is.

25:01.813 --> 25:03.863
It doesn't belong to you.

25:03.899 --> 25:06.065
It's a jointly held asset

25:06.117 --> 25:07.901
belonging to every man on this crew

25:07.953 --> 25:11.738
who sacrificed some part
of himself to build it.

25:11.790 --> 25:14.491
They have a say
about how it is managed,

25:14.543 --> 25:16.075
and I am the voice of it.

25:16.127 --> 25:19.746
It is clear to me that this raid
was more dangerous than the last.

25:19.798 --> 25:22.799
They are adapting, and it
is of some concern to me

25:22.834 --> 25:25.635
that you either cannot
or will not acknowledge it.

25:29.591 --> 25:32.976
I understand this is all
incredibly personal to you

25:33.011 --> 25:34.811
after the loss of Mrs. Barlow.

25:34.846 --> 25:36.312
Now, wait a minute...

25:36.348 --> 25:39.098
And I understand the burden of
playing the role you currently play

25:39.150 --> 25:41.818
must be taking a toll even you
cannot fully comprehend.

25:41.853 --> 25:43.436
Stop.

25:45.524 --> 25:49.325
Now you have wormed your way into
the heads of the men out there.

25:51.196 --> 25:54.113
And they've granted you authority
over them because of it.

25:56.785 --> 26:01.287
But in my head,
you are not welcome.

26:07.128 --> 26:08.761
<i>It's worse than I feared.</i>

26:08.797 --> 26:12.682
The wound should've been far further
along towards quieting itself.

26:14.302 --> 26:16.302
It's less than ideal.

26:19.808 --> 26:22.609
<i>Have you been cleaning it
as we discussed?</i>

26:22.644 --> 26:24.861
When I can.

26:24.896 --> 26:26.446
It's harder when we're at sea.

26:28.700 --> 26:31.200
I understand your aversion to
being seen using the crutches.

26:31.236 --> 26:32.986
Well, if you understand it,

26:33.038 --> 26:35.238
I wish you'd stop
hectoring me about it.

26:35.290 --> 26:38.825
But the boot was never
intended for a wound this new.

26:40.036 --> 26:41.556
Unless you remove
some of the pressure,

26:41.580 --> 26:44.213
the wound will only continue
to get more irritated.

26:44.249 --> 26:45.999
I'll lean more on the ropes.

26:46.001 --> 26:48.167
With all your weight?
On a moving deck?

26:48.169 --> 26:50.169
I'll manage.

26:50.171 --> 26:54.173
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.

27:12.855 --> 27:14.055
<i>Please let me explain.</i>

27:14.079 --> 27:15.361
<i>What is there to explain?</i>

27:15.413 --> 27:17.447
You couldn't figure out
how to repair the fort,

27:17.499 --> 27:20.366
so you lured me into capturing
a ship full of slaves to do the job.

27:20.368 --> 27:23.703
It was the first solid lead
on a slaver we'd had in weeks.

27:23.755 --> 27:26.556
I needed someone who I could
be certain would win her.

27:26.558 --> 27:28.708
So you lied to me about it.

27:31.012 --> 27:33.741
What the fuck made you think
I would just hand them over to you,

27:33.782 --> 27:35.798
knowing what you know of me?

27:40.221 --> 27:42.972
The three of us stood in this
room... you, Flint, and I...

27:43.024 --> 27:45.108
and we agreed
that the fort's restoration

27:45.143 --> 27:47.060
was critical to Nassau's security.

27:47.062 --> 27:49.312
We agreed you would
hire men to restore it.

27:49.364 --> 27:51.280
- I tried that!
- You're going to need to try harder!

27:51.316 --> 27:52.398
How?

27:52.450 --> 27:54.330
I offer the men exorbitant
wages to do the work.

27:54.369 --> 27:56.102
Do you know what they say?
"You can afford more. We want double that."

27:56.145 --> 27:57.484
All right, double it, it's a deal.
Fuck it.

27:57.522 --> 27:59.506
You know what they say then? "You can't
tell us what to do. We're free men."

27:59.605 --> 28:02.125
"We'll work when we please." Would you
like to take a guess how <i>that</i> is going?

28:02.160 --> 28:05.328
It's five different crews,
it's hundreds of men,

28:05.380 --> 28:07.797
untold thousands in wages,
and I swear to God,

28:07.832 --> 28:10.883
I think that hole in the wall
is bigger now than when we started.

28:10.919 --> 28:13.136
I stood between you and him, Jack.

28:13.171 --> 28:15.088
When Flint was ready
to wage war against you

28:15.090 --> 28:17.140
over the gold,
I was the one who said

28:17.175 --> 28:19.092
you would manage it
as well as anyone could.

28:19.094 --> 28:21.728
For the good of this place, I was
the one who said you could be trusted.

28:21.763 --> 28:23.479
<i>Why?</i>

28:23.515 --> 28:26.683
Why did you stand behind me
in that moment?

28:26.735 --> 28:28.351
I'll tell you why. Because you and
I had been through enough shit

28:28.389 --> 28:30.269
for you to know that I
would do the same for you,

28:30.271 --> 28:32.939
that I have done the same for you,
and would again without hesitation.

28:32.991 --> 28:35.575
I made a commitment
to you, with you,

28:35.610 --> 28:37.610
to restore this place,
to make it strong again.

28:37.612 --> 28:40.079
I see no other way to have it done.

28:40.115 --> 28:41.115
And I will have it done.

28:41.166 --> 28:43.666
I will move heaven
and earth to have it done

28:43.702 --> 28:45.451
because I refuse to let you down.

28:53.878 --> 28:57.380
<i>I knew this would be difficult
for you, so I kept it from you.</i>

29:00.051 --> 29:03.519
Please know that I meant
no slight by it.

29:03.555 --> 29:07.473
No lack of respect or friendship.

29:07.475 --> 29:09.809
It's quite the opposite.

29:23.324 --> 29:24.719
<i>Ship on the horizon!</i>

29:24.826 --> 29:26.375
<i>Ship on the horizon!</i>

29:26.411 --> 29:28.711
<i>Under bare poles!</i>

29:38.339 --> 29:39.839
Whose banner is that?

29:39.891 --> 29:42.842
- Hallendale.
- Here.

29:44.729 --> 29:47.346
<i>What the fuck's
he doing out there?</i>

29:49.267 --> 29:51.184
- Lying in wait?
- With his banner raised?

29:51.236 --> 29:53.820
Sails furled.

29:53.855 --> 29:56.239
Not a soul on the deck
or in the rig.

29:56.274 --> 29:58.241
Possible they abandoned her?

29:58.276 --> 30:00.526
Took a prize and decided
to sail away on it?

30:00.578 --> 30:02.662
Had to have been a hell of a prize.

30:02.697 --> 30:05.038
Even Hallendale isn't stupid enough
to leave a ship like that behind.

30:05.039 --> 30:07.033
He could've sailed it back to
Nassau with a few dozen men.

30:07.035 --> 30:08.201
<i>Less.</i>

30:12.707 --> 30:15.291
Why don't we go in closer,
see what's what?

30:15.343 --> 30:17.176
What if they're in distress?

30:19.964 --> 30:21.714
Alter our course to close with her.

30:21.766 --> 30:23.349
Bear away to port.

30:23.384 --> 30:25.218
<i>Bear away to port!</i>

30:28.223 --> 30:29.806
What?

30:29.858 --> 30:33.726
You'll lose our advantage
in this wind.

30:33.728 --> 30:36.813
Delay our return to Nassau
by a day, maybe two.

30:36.865 --> 30:39.732
And we're in dire need of resupply.

30:39.784 --> 30:42.318
Short on foodstuffs,
very short on shot.

30:42.370 --> 30:45.454
That storm in the southwest
isn't dying away.

30:45.490 --> 30:48.291
And we dawdle, we'll find ourselves
right in the middle of it.

30:48.326 --> 30:50.806
And there's a good chance that
that ship we're about to approach

30:50.829 --> 30:54.297
is quiet because all its men
are below deck with a plague.

30:56.918 --> 30:59.135
You think I should've tried
to talk them out of this.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.753
Yeah.

31:02.557 --> 31:06.259
You rally the men
to fight behind the idea

31:06.311 --> 31:08.895
that these are days in which all
of Nassau must stand together.

31:10.565 --> 31:13.733
Either that means
something or it doesn't.

31:13.768 --> 31:15.184
And how the hell
would I argue the latter,

31:15.236 --> 31:16.736
just so we could avoid a delay?

31:16.771 --> 31:19.856
These days any man
who can sew a black flag

31:19.908 --> 31:23.409
and get 10 fools to follow
him can take a prize.

31:23.444 --> 31:25.244
They can take it because of the fear

31:25.280 --> 31:28.664
that I and men like me
have instilled in their prey.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.083
But they can't do what I can do.

31:31.119 --> 31:32.501
They're not built for it.

31:32.537 --> 31:34.637
And sooner or later,
they'll be exposed.

31:35.957 --> 31:37.506
Any fool who followed Hallendale

31:37.542 --> 31:40.843
deserves whatever end
they got in his company.

31:40.879 --> 31:45.214
You were right. This war
is getting more dangerous.

31:45.266 --> 31:48.467
The strong among us must
stand together and face it.

31:48.519 --> 31:50.970
But the fools and the pretenders...

31:52.807 --> 31:55.474
they were never truly
among us to begin with.

31:57.312 --> 32:00.062
As their quartermaster,
it's your decision.

32:00.114 --> 32:03.482
But that's how I might've
argued it to my men...

32:03.534 --> 32:05.701
to avoid unnecessary delay.

32:29.978 --> 32:31.510
<i>Bring your captain on!</i>

32:38.102 --> 32:40.019
There's no damage.

32:43.241 --> 32:45.574
Longboats are gone.

32:45.610 --> 32:47.360
Looks like they just
up and left her here.

32:55.536 --> 32:59.338
Sweep the hold before the captain
goes across just in case there's...

35:46.958 --> 35:49.091
"We die alone."

36:22.960 --> 36:24.460
Someone get me a glass.

36:27.548 --> 36:30.883
Fresh water's been pumped out.

36:30.918 --> 36:32.885
Food stores as well.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.471
They've scavenged half the rig
to anchor this far from shore.

36:35.506 --> 36:39.475
They marooned him,
left him for dead.

36:46.350 --> 36:47.733
Seawater.

36:47.768 --> 36:49.768
Bastard went mad.

36:59.614 --> 37:02.364
<i>The whole crew, every man,</i>

37:02.416 --> 37:04.250
<i>all decide to maroon him</i>

37:04.285 --> 37:07.086
and they go to this much
effort to do it in deep water

37:07.121 --> 37:11.123
rather than keeping the ship
and leaving him ashore?

37:11.125 --> 37:13.792
<i>Why the fuck would they do that?</i>

37:16.315 --> 37:18.075
We need to get out of here.

37:18.099 --> 37:19.619
What is it?

37:20.635 --> 37:22.101
Get out of here now.

37:22.136 --> 37:24.520
- Sail!
<i>- Sail!</i>

37:24.555 --> 37:26.639
<i>- Heading?</i>
- Headed this way!

37:26.691 --> 37:28.307
<i>East-southeast!</i>

37:28.309 --> 37:31.110
Get us underway!

37:31.145 --> 37:33.395
<i>Do it now!</i>

37:40.988 --> 37:43.072
<i>British colors.</i>

37:43.124 --> 37:44.790
Not Navy.

37:48.329 --> 37:49.878
She's a hunter.

37:49.914 --> 37:53.499
Carrying 50 guns, maybe more.

37:53.551 --> 37:56.051
It's already a mile inside the horizon.

37:56.087 --> 38:00.422
Must've been trailing us with her
sail reduced until we took the bait.

38:00.474 --> 38:02.558
Drew us into a position where
he's got the weather gauge.

38:02.593 --> 38:05.811
Landmass to the west,
storm to the south,

38:05.846 --> 38:09.265
and no point of sail
on which we can outrun her.

38:09.317 --> 38:11.433
- Someone get me a chart!
<i>- Chart for the captain!</i>

38:11.485 --> 38:14.687
Full and by on the starboard tack
as close as you can.

38:14.689 --> 38:16.355
- Can we fight her?
- Behind the wind?

38:16.407 --> 38:17.856
With barely a broadside
worth of shot on hand?

38:17.908 --> 38:19.441
We won't stand a chance.

38:21.412 --> 38:23.445
We may not have a choice.

39:02.036 --> 39:04.403
We got all the money in the world.

39:04.405 --> 39:07.489
Maybe we could find a room
that ain't in the middle of a whorehouse.

39:09.577 --> 39:14.246
I own a tavern, a brothel,
a tanner, a butcher...

39:14.965 --> 39:19.084
interests in a dozen other
concerns on the street.

39:19.136 --> 39:21.970
I am the one they come to here
when they need things,

39:22.006 --> 39:25.758
want things, fear things.

39:25.810 --> 39:29.178
In another time and another place,
they would call me a queen.

39:31.515 --> 39:33.349
I built this from nothing.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.820
And none of it is real.

39:37.855 --> 39:40.356
What ain't real about it?

39:43.110 --> 39:47.780
Because it is built upon things
I cannot control, cannot predict.

39:48.332 --> 39:51.033
It is built on sand.

39:52.703 --> 39:55.621
And when the day comes
when that foundation shifts,

39:55.673 --> 39:57.172
when civilization returns,

39:57.208 --> 39:59.458
do you know what they
will call me then?

40:01.796 --> 40:04.213
The whore that lost everything.

40:08.519 --> 40:11.470
I like it in this room.

40:11.522 --> 40:13.889
Reminds me that nothing
has changed yet.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.980
You saying this ain't real?

40:24.485 --> 40:25.984
Of course it is.

40:29.707 --> 40:32.074
The fort will be repaired.

40:32.126 --> 40:34.626
If he says it, he'll do it.

40:38.501 --> 40:40.861
When you first opened that door
and showed me the Urca gold,

40:40.885 --> 40:42.384
do you know what I saw?

40:44.054 --> 40:45.421
A solution.

40:45.473 --> 40:49.975
The mortar that would secure
the sand beneath our feet.

40:50.594 --> 40:53.145
The thing I could offer
to England or Spain

40:53.180 --> 40:55.848
or whomever arrived here and
threatened to reorder things,

40:55.850 --> 40:59.017
and say,
"Take this and leave me be."

41:01.021 --> 41:03.021
Everything is dependent
upon that gold,

41:03.023 --> 41:06.608
and right now it is sitting in a fort
with no guns and full of holes.

41:06.660 --> 41:09.194
Charles is gonna agree
to Jack's plan.

41:09.196 --> 41:12.197
In a month,
the fort will be whole.

41:12.249 --> 41:14.533
Made so by slave labor?

41:14.585 --> 41:16.702
Has it not occurred to anyone

41:16.704 --> 41:20.255
that if Jack has not been able to
persuade men to repair the fort,

41:20.291 --> 41:23.959
it is even less likely he will be
able to persuade them to defend it?

41:25.429 --> 41:27.179
The fuck are you saying?

41:27.214 --> 41:30.215
I am saying that if England
were to return right now,

41:30.267 --> 41:33.135
there is nothing to stop them
from capturing that fort.

41:33.187 --> 41:35.721
And so long as that gold
is inside it,

41:35.723 --> 41:39.024
they will be capturing
our futures along with it.

41:39.059 --> 41:41.393
The gold must be
removed from the fort

41:41.445 --> 41:44.480
whether Jack wants it or not.

41:44.532 --> 41:46.398
You're getting awful close

41:46.400 --> 41:48.617
to doing the one thing
you said you'd never do.

41:51.372 --> 41:54.573
Don't ask me to take sides
between you and him.

41:56.744 --> 41:59.378
It doesn't matter. Can't be done.

41:59.413 --> 42:01.797
There's a reason it's up
there in the first place.

42:01.832 --> 42:03.673
There's no other place
to put it and secure it.

42:04.752 --> 42:07.386
Not in its current form, no.

42:18.432 --> 42:22.434
<i>Heave! Heave!</i>

42:32.029 --> 42:34.496
He's well within range.

42:34.532 --> 42:36.748
Then why isn't he firing?

42:36.784 --> 42:39.251
Closing in, making sure
he doesn't miss.

42:39.286 --> 42:40.619
And he doesn't need to rush.

42:40.621 --> 42:42.120
There's nothing
we can do to stop it.

42:42.172 --> 42:44.172
On this side of that coast,

42:44.208 --> 42:46.091
he'll always be faster,
more maneuverable.

42:47.628 --> 42:51.964
Whoever that is out there,
he has us.

42:51.966 --> 42:53.181
Bullshit.

42:55.970 --> 42:58.270
That man has a goddamned
answer for everything.

42:58.305 --> 43:01.473
He's working on an answer for this.

43:01.475 --> 43:04.443
<i>She's opening her gun ports!</i>

43:05.813 --> 43:10.399
Gun crews, prepare to return fire!

43:10.451 --> 43:12.284
<i>Gun crews at the ready!</i>

43:15.322 --> 43:17.656
Cartridge.

43:20.794 --> 43:22.160
<i>Gun crews ready!</i>

43:29.219 --> 43:31.169
<i>Crew of the Walrus!</i>

43:34.174 --> 43:36.508
<i>In my capacity as duly</i>
<i>appointed servant</i>

43:36.560 --> 43:40.012
<i>of His Majesty</i>
<i>King George the First,</i>

43:40.014 --> 43:41.563
<i>I address you directly.</i>

43:41.599 --> 43:43.432
Hornigold.

43:43.484 --> 43:45.484
<i>Time is short, so I will be plain</i>

43:45.519 --> 43:47.653
<i>and offer you</i>
<i>the same terms as accepted</i>

43:47.688 --> 43:50.522
by the late
Captain Hallendale's men.

43:54.695 --> 43:57.195
Surrender, and I am authorized

43:57.197 --> 44:01.199
to offer you full, unqualified pardons.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.503
<i>Your ship will be commandeered</i>

44:04.538 --> 44:08.173
<i>and you will be given a choice of
either entering into my service</i>

44:08.208 --> 44:11.343
<i>or being set free at the
nearest convenient port,</i>

44:11.378 --> 44:14.930
<i>your names cleared</i>
<i>and your accounts squared.</i>

44:14.965 --> 44:17.966
<i>Refuse and I shall grant no quarter.</i>

44:27.695 --> 44:30.362
Do you think they'll take it?

44:30.397 --> 44:33.315
I don't care.

44:33.367 --> 44:34.950
Make the guns ready.

44:52.169 --> 44:54.252
There'll be no battle today.

44:56.223 --> 44:58.423
Our disadvantage is too great.

45:00.844 --> 45:03.095
<i>But what price surrender?</i>

45:05.399 --> 45:08.734
To beg forgiveness from a thing
that took my woman from me?

45:11.188 --> 45:13.689
My friend?

45:13.741 --> 45:16.191
<i>Murdered her,</i>

45:16.243 --> 45:19.611
<i>displayed her body</i>
<i>for their amusement.</i>

45:19.613 --> 45:25.522
I can walk away from this fight
if I just sign my name

45:25.536 --> 45:30.505
beneath a solemn oath
never again to do violence against it.

45:36.797 --> 45:37.846
No.

45:41.385 --> 45:43.435
Not after all it has taken from me.

45:46.974 --> 45:49.307
Not after all it has taken from you.

45:52.196 --> 45:58.133
I will do great violence
against that thing.

46:00.988 --> 46:05.824
They say they will pardon us all,

46:05.826 --> 46:08.493
but I say to offer to pardon

46:08.545 --> 46:12.164
something one fears
is the act of a coward.

46:13.667 --> 46:15.917
To offer them in volume

46:15.969 --> 46:20.472
suggests that their fear of us
is becoming unmanageable,

46:21.175 --> 46:24.142
that we have shown them
what we are capable of

46:24.178 --> 46:26.178
and it terrifies them.

46:32.069 --> 46:37.022
Do any of you want to surrender
to men who fear you?

46:37.024 --> 46:41.026
Lay down arms in a battle
that we are winning?

46:51.421 --> 46:53.121
Neither do I.

46:56.043 --> 46:59.711
Fuck Benjamin Hornigold,

46:59.763 --> 47:02.881
his king, and their pardons.

47:05.219 --> 47:07.385
This war isn't nearly over.

47:10.107 --> 47:13.859
We're not fighting,
and we're not surrendering.

47:15.896 --> 47:18.063
So what are we doing?

47:20.367 --> 47:22.734
We're going that way.

47:25.739 --> 47:28.073
That's a ship killer.

47:28.125 --> 47:31.743
Then he'd be mad to follow us
into it, then, wouldn't he?

47:35.249 --> 47:39.417
Billy, soon as he makes
his break to fire, we run.

47:55.519 --> 47:57.769
Port side batteries are readied.

47:57.771 --> 48:00.322
Let's encourage them to see reason.

48:00.357 --> 48:03.608
Prepare to head up and bring us
into position to fire.

48:09.116 --> 48:10.116
Now.

48:10.117 --> 48:11.416
Now!

48:13.120 --> 48:15.620
There she goes! She's winding up!

48:15.672 --> 48:17.422
Hard to port.

48:21.295 --> 48:23.044
What the hell is he doing?

48:23.096 --> 48:25.764
He'll end up
in the middle of that storm.

48:25.799 --> 48:27.215
Hold on!

48:32.856 --> 48:34.139
There. Hold her there.

48:36.476 --> 48:38.193
- Fire!
<i>- Fire!</i>

48:52.326 --> 48:54.993
Bring us hard to port.
Make a course to pursue her.

49:08.842 --> 49:11.009
Make sure the hatches are fully battened.

49:11.061 --> 49:12.677
Secure the lashings.

49:12.679 --> 49:15.730
Mr. Silver, we got hits
all along the starboard side.

49:15.766 --> 49:18.850
When we reach that weather, we're
gonna be taking on water down here.

49:24.358 --> 49:26.274
Well, seal it up as best you can.

49:26.326 --> 49:27.776
I'll be down to lend a hand soon.

49:33.867 --> 49:35.333
<i>It isn't just him.</i>

49:37.704 --> 49:39.254
What?

49:40.707 --> 49:44.009
Captain Hume said it took him
every ounce of leverage he could muster

49:44.044 --> 49:46.461
to secure just 10 pardons.

49:46.513 --> 49:48.213
And now Hornigold holds 80 of them.

49:48.215 --> 49:51.349
Maybe Flint's right.
Maybe they are getting nervous.

49:51.385 --> 49:54.019
Or maybe someone else
secured them for him.

49:54.054 --> 49:57.055
Someone larger
than Hume or Hornigold.

49:57.057 --> 50:00.358
Someone to whom the rules
as we understand them don't apply.

50:02.195 --> 50:04.612
Flint was right about one thing.

50:06.533 --> 50:08.950
<i>This is only the beginning.</i>

50:08.986 --> 50:11.403
Something else is coming.

51:11.965 --> 51:15.967
<i>Judge: "For years
you lorded over the operations</i>

51:15.969 --> 51:20.138
<i>of hundreds, if not thousands,
of hardened pirates.</i>

51:20.140 --> 51:22.857
<i>How exactly were you</i>
<i>able to manage this?"</i>

51:22.893 --> 51:26.978
Accused:
"One day at a time, I suppose."

51:30.117 --> 51:31.566
I enjoyed that.

51:37.991 --> 51:42.243
There is a funny thing
about notoriety,

51:42.295 --> 51:44.662
and I have a little
experience with this.

51:44.664 --> 51:47.332
The more people know of you,

51:47.384 --> 51:52.053
the more of you those people
feel belongs to them.

51:52.506 --> 51:55.673
Now, right now,
there is a barrister

51:55.675 --> 51:57.892
who feels entitled to say,

51:57.928 --> 52:01.646
"I am the one who convicted
Eleanor Guthrie."

52:01.681 --> 52:05.233
A judge who wants to say,
"I was the one who hanged her."

52:05.268 --> 52:08.069
A throng of people outside...

52:08.105 --> 52:10.855
"I was the one
who cheered as she swung."

52:10.907 --> 52:13.858
They all feel entitled
to a part of your story.

52:13.910 --> 52:15.410
And it's a hell of a story.

52:15.445 --> 52:17.028
So you can imagine
how difficult it was for me

52:17.030 --> 52:20.281
to arrange it so that I could say,

52:20.333 --> 52:22.283
"I am the one who set her free."

52:22.335 --> 52:24.419
Who the fuck are you?

52:27.591 --> 52:30.175
My name is Woodes Rogers,

52:30.210 --> 52:33.261
and I am the next governor
of New Providence Island.

52:33.296 --> 52:37.298
Well, assuming I can subdue her.

52:39.302 --> 52:41.102
That is where you come in.

52:41.138 --> 52:45.557
I am to set sail
for the West Indies in two days' time.

52:45.609 --> 52:48.109
I am prepared.

52:48.145 --> 52:51.446
But the one element
I lack is knowledge,

52:51.481 --> 52:53.948
<i>someone who understands Nassau</i>

52:53.984 --> 52:56.201
<i>and can help me know</i>
<i>what I'm going to find there.</i>

52:56.236 --> 52:59.154
<i>If you agree</i>
<i>to be that person for me,</i>

52:59.206 --> 53:01.706
<i>your sentence will be commuted</i>

53:01.741 --> 53:04.459
<i>and the charges</i>
<i>against you released.</i>

53:04.494 --> 53:06.411
And what would you ask of me?

53:06.463 --> 53:10.715
I understand it is an
uncomfortable position for you,

53:10.750 --> 53:13.251
feeling like you're betraying
people you've known so closely...

53:13.253 --> 53:15.753
Specifically,
what would I have to do?

53:15.805 --> 53:19.641
To begin with?

53:19.676 --> 53:21.176
A list.

53:21.228 --> 53:25.430
<i>The names of those on the island</i>
<i>who could be made allies,</i>

53:25.482 --> 53:28.516
<i>those who would be harder to sway.</i>

53:43.200 --> 53:45.166
You want to civilize Nassau?

53:46.786 --> 53:49.287
That is the only name
you need concern yourself with.

53:59.883 --> 54:02.300
As long as he is alive,
you cannot succeed.

54:34.334 --> 54:36.668
<i>Your slaves are making progress.</i>

54:45.762 --> 54:48.646
You know I take no pleasure in it.

54:48.682 --> 54:49.931
If there were any other way...

54:49.983 --> 54:54.152
Jack, if I thought it
gave you any pleasure,

54:55.155 --> 54:57.438
I'd have killed you
the moment you suggested it.

55:00.744 --> 55:01.943
Hmm.

55:01.995 --> 55:05.113
<i>The first moment</i>
<i>I saw it on the beach,</i>

55:05.165 --> 55:08.166
I thought, "My God,

55:08.201 --> 55:11.669
the things I'm going
to build with this."

55:11.705 --> 55:13.705
A city...

55:13.757 --> 55:17.175
alive in a place
it has no right to be,

55:17.210 --> 55:21.346
in defiance of all reason
and refusing to be dislodged,

55:21.381 --> 55:25.016
but growing and...

55:29.639 --> 55:32.807
a place that, 50 years hence
and when I'm long gone

55:32.859 --> 55:36.394
<i>would force the world</i>
<i>to acknowledge</i>

55:36.396 --> 55:38.146
Jack Rackham was here.

55:42.235 --> 55:44.202
I swear to God,
when I sit here long enough,

55:44.237 --> 55:45.987
I can hear it laughing at me.

55:51.745 --> 55:54.045
You don't have to be here, you know.

55:54.080 --> 55:58.082
I have made it clear to all involved
they are to be treated fairly.

56:00.003 --> 56:02.553
You think if you refrain from
beating them, it's any better?

56:07.644 --> 56:09.177
It isn't the violence.

56:11.398 --> 56:15.600
It isn't the labor or the hunger

56:15.652 --> 56:17.435
or the heat or the chains.

56:21.491 --> 56:23.574
You know what those men
fear right now?

56:26.279 --> 56:28.246
It's the unknown.

56:28.281 --> 56:33.868
<i>Lash that comes from nowhere</i>
<i>for reasons never explained.</i>

56:33.920 --> 56:36.170
<i>A visit from the taskmaster</i>
<i>in the dead of night.</i>

56:38.291 --> 56:39.874
<i>But I remember that fear.</i>

56:42.462 --> 56:44.796
Right now, I feel it returning.

56:46.549 --> 56:48.633
<i>What we're doing here,</i>

56:48.685 --> 56:51.853
<i>sitting on Spain's gold</i>
<i>on England's island,</i>

56:51.888 --> 56:54.105
demands a response.

56:56.860 --> 57:00.061
<i>What that response will be,</i>

57:00.113 --> 57:03.781
<i>what form it will take,</i>

57:03.817 --> 57:05.817
<i>what face it will wear...</i>

57:09.155 --> 57:12.540
<i>by the time we do know it,</i>
<i>there will be no time</i>

57:12.575 --> 57:14.409
<i>to prepare for the blow</i>
<i>that follows.</i>

58:33.540 --> 58:34.705
Hmm.

58:38.278 --> 58:39.861
Excuse me, sir.

58:42.199 --> 58:45.033
I wonder if you could help me
locate an old friend of mine.

58:47.787 --> 58:49.621
His name is Charles Vane.
