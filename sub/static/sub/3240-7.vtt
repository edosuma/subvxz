09:31.038 --> 09:33.672
Were you aware at all
that tyler had a tattoo?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.740
A rather prominent one
on his chest?

09:35.742 --> 09:38.476
A tattoo? Tyler?
Really?

09:38.478 --> 09:41.279
Excuse me,
can I help you two?

09:42.448 --> 09:43.848
I'm an nypd
detective,

09:43.850 --> 09:46.251
And we're investigating
tyler's murder.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.387
Okay. Well, this is
a memorial service, detective.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.489
And I'm sure
mr. And mrs. Forester,

09:51.491 --> 09:53.224
Like the rest of us,
would appreciate it --

09:53.226 --> 09:55.427
Mr. Forester
invited us.

Cassandra mueller.
I'm an attorney.

09:58.332 --> 10:01.266
Does paul here
<i>need</i> a lawyer?

10:02.001 --> 10:03.668
Actually,
we were just leaving.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.804
Detective,
might I have a moment?

10:07.473 --> 10:09.874
I'm sorry
for your loss.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.177
We'll be in touch.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.682
Carter pilsen. Hi.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.518
I'm so sorry
for cassandra's tone.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.487
And, uh...Paul.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.823
But it's a tough day for all
of us, as you can imagine,

10:24.825 --> 10:26.157
And, of course,
we'd like to help you

10:26.159 --> 10:28.259
With your investigation
any way we can.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.461
Thank you.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.962
When was the last time
<i>you</i> saw tyler?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.664
Before the night
of the murder?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.232
[ chuckles ]

10:34.234 --> 10:36.368
Um, I presented him with
the "hero award" that evening.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.004
We chatted briefly afterward,
but he left early,

10:39.006 --> 10:41.640
Said he had to be up
at the clinic the next day.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.842
And before that...

10:43.844 --> 10:46.111
Several years.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.747
We were all really close
in high school,

10:48.749 --> 10:52.484
But, you know [chuckles]
things change.

10:52.486 --> 10:58.223
Hmm. Can you think of a reason
why the date "June 10, 2005"

10:58.225 --> 11:01.326
Would mean anything special
to tyler?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.627
No.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.928
Why?

11:05.097 --> 11:07.365
Thank you for your time,
mr. Pilsen.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.268
And, again,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.609
What was that about?
That date?

11:17.611 --> 11:19.477
The guy practically
turned white.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.745
Yes, he did,
didn't he?

11:20.747 --> 11:22.981
Do you have
a mirror on you?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.550
You know, one of those --
what do you call them --

11:25.552 --> 11:26.751

Tyler's tattoo --
June 10, 2005.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.182
It was a <i>date</i>
<i>he wanted to remember.</i>

11:57.184 --> 12:00.185
Or he wouldn't let himself
forget.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.192
It was the day
he graduated from hamilton.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.660
Everything
seemed perfect.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.295
I think
they all left

12:10.297 --> 12:12.564
Later that afternoon
for southampton,

12:12.566 --> 12:13.898
To spend the summer.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.202
The four of them were...
Inseparable.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.805
I think tyler
had a mad crush on cassandra.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.141
Though I believe it was paul
that she was dating.

12:23.143 --> 12:27.178
But tyler didn't stay with them
on long island for long.

12:27.180 --> 12:31.082
He was back in the city
in a few weeks' time.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.650
Why'd he leave early?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.953
I don't know.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.423
But that's really
when the change in him began.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.291
This...Sadness.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.694
It's also when
he started refusing

12:42.696 --> 12:44.596
To take any money
from us.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.964
At the last second,

12:45.966 --> 12:49.033
He chose to attend
a state school over harvard,

12:49.035 --> 12:50.835
To pay his own tuition.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.370
It's admirable.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.539
Of course, we...

12:55.741 --> 12:58.977
...Admire tyler
for his choices, his...

12:58.979 --> 13:02.213
Commitment
to helping others.

13:02.215 --> 13:06.551

Well, very few bounds --

so far.

Wow, don't think
anybody at my high school

Because of me and cass

16:38.631 --> 16:39.630

in love with her.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.200

There are two kinds of people
in this world --

16:44.104 --> 16:46.938

and those who look forward.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.073
I think
tyler looked back.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.209
And lord knows
paul does.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.045
But cassandra and I
are different.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.481
Cassandra's special.
There's no one like her.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.951
We've all tried
to help paul.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.620
I know that
a few years ago,

17:02.622 --> 17:04.622
Tyler gave him
a key to his place.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.891
The night he was killed,
I was at home.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.559
Just, you know, home.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.329
After the awards,
I went back to my office.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.197
I had a ton of work to do.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.899
Cassandra was there
with me.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.769
Actually, she's one
of the lawyers on a deal
I'm spearheading.

17:17.771 --> 17:21.072
I went uptown to see tyler
a few weeks ago.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.907
I had been...
Missing him.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.244
I don't think I told carter
or paul about it, though.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.247
They can both tend to
get a little...Jealous.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.449
Carter: Paul thought cass
had started seeing tyler.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.583
Like, dating.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.718
He called me about it.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.887
This was a few days
before tyler was killed.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.121
But he was wrong.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.956
And I-I told him so.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.425
Why do <i>you</i> think

17:40.427 --> 17:45.263
Tyler had "6-10-05" tattooed
in reverse across his chest?

17:47.466 --> 17:48.266
No clue.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.134
You'd have to ask tyler.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.172

Paul was right

17:54.174 --> 17:56.374
About cassandra having started
to see tyler again.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.642
The necklace
she was wearing

17:57.644 --> 17:59.077

with the triangle charm on it,

It's the other half
of the one

18:01.147 --> 18:02.814
We found
at tyler's apartment.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.516
But she's clearly romantically
involved with carter, as well.

18:05.518 --> 18:09.520
There's a gift-wrapped box of
perfume at carter's -- chanel.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.589
It was a present
for cassandra.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.990
It's the scent
that she wears.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.225
I detected it
when we were with her.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.227
Hm, fond of chanel,
are we?

18:17.062 --> 18:20.164
But it's clear that paul still
carries a torch for cassandra,

18:20.166 --> 18:21.632
Which is why
she was hiding

18:21.634 --> 18:24.035
Her relationship
with tyler and carter from him.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.903

of abduction precautions.

at the murder.

Furthermore,

his having been hit by a car.

possibly know that?

29:47.987 --> 29:50.621
Because, again,
due to the bone fractures,

29:50.623 --> 29:54.191
The bumper was likely to be
22 to 25 inches off the ground,

29:54.193 --> 29:57.995

I, uh...

40:20.051 --> 40:25.221
I just laid there on the ground,
terrified, 'til it was over.

40:25.223 --> 40:28.124
I never told anyone.

40:28.126 --> 40:32.829
But afterwards, I found out that
three of our guys were killed.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.500
As long as I live,
I'll always wonder

40:37.502 --> 40:39.969
If they might be alive
if I had joined that fight.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.205
Abe, you can't
blame yourself for that.

40:43.340 --> 40:44.808
Sure I can.

40:47.978 --> 40:52.615
Henry:
But don't you see, abigail?
I chose myself over him.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.083
I might have been able
to save the man,

40:54.085 --> 40:56.486
But I chose not to risk
being exposed.

40:56.488 --> 40:57.687
Henry, darling,
please.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.489
You're being too hard
on yourself.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.658
[ breathing heavily ]

41:01.660 --> 41:06.696
I can no longer be a doctor
if I know that, if pressed,

41:06.698 --> 41:07.931
I'll break my oath.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.632
[ door opens ]
henry, please.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.401
You could no sooner
not be a doctor than I c--

41:11.403 --> 41:13.470
Mom, dad, I'm home.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.839
Wash up for dinner, abe.

41:18.008 --> 41:22.545
You did what you did
not for yourself, but for us.

41:22.547 --> 41:23.746
For your family.

41:23.748 --> 41:27.750
You'll get past this.
You must.

41:27.752 --> 41:30.820
Just give it time.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.022
Henry:
<i>There are things for all of us</i>

41:33.024 --> 41:34.891
<i>That even</i>
<i>all the time in the world</i>

41:34.893 --> 41:36.292
<i>Wouldn't be able to erase.</i>

41:36.294 --> 41:38.828
Hey.
Don't let it get cold.

41:41.098 --> 41:44.234
Oh, uh, fair warning,
it's a little spicy.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.569
[ slurps ]

41:48.105 --> 41:50.573
Oh, this is fantastic.
What's in it?

41:50.575 --> 41:52.542
That's a secret.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.747
[ both chuckling ]
