00:31.623 --> 00:35.753
<i>You know, there's been a lot
of talk about Abraham Lincoln.</i>

00:35.794 --> 00:38.558
<i>But the president we need today
is not Abraham Lincoln.</i>

00:38.597 --> 00:41.862
<i>The president we need
today is Thomas Jefferson.</i>

00:41.900 --> 00:45.563
<i>He said that we needed
a revolution every generation.</i>

00:45.604 --> 00:47.572
<i>Thomas Jefferson said
you have to be ready</i>

00:47.606 --> 00:49.471
<i>in order to preserve
the vitality</i>

00:49.508 --> 00:51.339
<i>of your liberty and your freedom</i>

00:51.376 --> 00:54.038
<i>to defend it not by
overthrowing anything else</i>

00:54.079 --> 00:56.445
<i>except for what you
have been holding in your head</i>

00:56.481 --> 00:59.245
<i>that may not be
applicable anymore.</i>

00:59.284 --> 01:00.546
<i>We've gotten very lazy.</i>

01:00.585 --> 01:02.280
<i>We're many generations overdue</i>

01:02.320 --> 01:04.150
<i>for a revolution
in our thinking.</i>

01:04.188 --> 01:06.157
<i>I'm not talking about
blood and violence;</i>

01:06.191 --> 01:09.319
<i>although I'm afraid
that's already happening.</i>

01:09.361 --> 01:10.919
<i>I'm talking about a revolution</i>

01:10.962 --> 01:12.327
<i>that's probably
the hardest kind,</i>

01:12.364 --> 01:14.457
<i>the kind that takes place
inside the human soul</i>

01:14.499 --> 01:16.160
<i>and the human mind,</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:17.896
<i>to be able
to tear everything down,</i>

01:17.936 --> 01:19.301
<i>throw everything out,</i>

01:19.337 --> 01:21.168
<i>and start with a completely
fresh piece of paper</i>

01:21.206 --> 01:24.232
<i>and say, "Okay, how do we
solve this problem?"</i>

01:46.998 --> 01:49.023
<i>Can you talk to me
a little bit, like...</i>

01:49.067 --> 01:52.127
<i>I mean, who are you?</i>

01:59.411 --> 02:00.605
Listen, this is not a plan

02:00.645 --> 02:02.670
that would make sense to anybody
except God.

02:02.714 --> 02:06.081
You know, I gave up trying to
figure that out a long time ago.

02:06.118 --> 02:08.279
I was born into a family
deeply connected

02:08.320 --> 02:09.787
to the U.S.
intelligence community.

02:09.821 --> 02:11.448
My mother had been
a cryptanalyst

02:11.490 --> 02:14.926
at the Army Security Agency
and NSA in World War II.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.157
Her work product went
to the President Roosevelt

02:18.196 --> 02:24.692
and to Secretary of War Stimson
and Cordell Hull at State.

02:24.736 --> 02:27.398
My father was
an Air Force aviator

02:27.439 --> 02:29.634
who went to work
for Martin Marietta

02:29.674 --> 02:31.767
on contracts for the CIA
and the Air Force,

02:31.810 --> 02:33.175
namely the Titan IIIC

02:33.211 --> 02:37.773
which put out the CIA's
Keyhole spy satellites.

02:37.816 --> 02:40.876
At age 19 when I was interning
for LAPD,

02:40.919 --> 02:42.319
I was pulled into
the chief's office

02:42.354 --> 02:44.322
because somebody discovered
I had a Q clearance.

02:44.356 --> 02:45.914
I didn't know anything about it.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.322
I went home,
and I asked Dad he said,

02:47.359 --> 02:49.054
"Yeah, because you're my son,

02:49.094 --> 02:51.221
"and, you know,
they have to do that

02:51.263 --> 02:53.424
because I might leave
my briefcase open."

02:53.465 --> 02:55.865
But a Q was a secret
compartmentalized clearance

02:55.901 --> 02:57.892
above top secret.

03:00.839 --> 03:02.739
I went through UCLA
as a Republican

03:02.774 --> 03:04.765
who didn't like anything
about the war in Vietnam,

03:04.809 --> 03:06.834
who didn't like anything
about government

03:06.878 --> 03:09.176
with this naive belief that,
you know,

03:09.214 --> 03:10.374
you can get inside the system

03:10.382 --> 03:12.247
and change it from the inside.

03:15.554 --> 03:18.523
I became an L.A. policeman,

03:18.557 --> 03:20.582
worked in South Central
Los Angeles in The Jungle,

03:20.625 --> 03:22.422
and the CIA tried unofficially

03:22.460 --> 03:24.325
to recruit me into an operation

03:24.362 --> 03:26.242
where they were smuggling drugs
into the country

03:26.264 --> 03:28.630
back in 1976, 1977,

03:28.667 --> 03:30.794
and I wouldn't get involved
in that.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.803
You know, I thought,
"Well, jeez, this must be

03:32.837 --> 03:35.271
"an isolated incident
of corruption.

03:35.307 --> 03:36.569
"This must be something

03:36.608 --> 03:38.667
"that everybody is gonna
want to correct right away.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.302
My God."

03:40.345 --> 03:42.108
And of course
that was a mistake.

03:42.147 --> 03:43.876
Basically my life disintegrated

03:43.915 --> 03:46.577
because I was betrayed
by a woman

03:46.618 --> 03:49.178
who worked for CIA,
who was my fiancée,

03:49.221 --> 03:51.086
and when I said I wouldn't
get involved in drugs,

03:51.122 --> 03:53.522
she disappeared, and people
started shooting at me,

03:53.558 --> 03:56.049
and then it was
a matter of saving my life,

03:56.094 --> 03:59.655
and the tools which
I acquired to save my life then,

03:59.698 --> 04:02.258
which were, you know,
writing letters to congressmen,

04:02.300 --> 04:03.562
getting on the record,

04:03.602 --> 04:05.695
trying to get
newspaper stories written,

04:05.737 --> 04:07.602
those were survival skills,

04:07.639 --> 04:11.939
but it was also a part
of learning how things worked.

04:11.977 --> 04:14.309
I was a mapmaker if you will,
a cartographer,

04:14.346 --> 04:17.007
going out to try and map
how the world really worked

04:17.048 --> 04:20.245
as opposed to the way
we were told it worked.

04:20.285 --> 04:22.583
And the map that we have made

04:22.621 --> 04:26.955
has proved so startlingly
accurate over ten years

04:26.992 --> 04:28.983
whether they had to do
with gold prices

04:29.027 --> 04:34.522
or geopolitical developments
or economic events.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.794
The only thing that amazes me

04:35.834 --> 04:39.497
is the speed with which things
are falling apart,

04:39.537 --> 04:40.765
and that message now

04:40.805 --> 04:43.865
is the single most
important thing in my life.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.148
It's the only thing in my life,

04:45.176 --> 04:49.408
well, except for rock and roll
music, good music,

04:49.447 --> 04:52.280
playing with my dog,
and long walks on the beach.

04:58.790 --> 05:03.056
Rags, come here.
Rags, come here.

05:06.197 --> 05:12.295
I first became focused
on energy issues in late 2001,

05:12.337 --> 05:15.067
just maybe a month or two
after 9/11.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.301
I was contacted by a geologist,

05:17.342 --> 05:20.140
a brilliant guy named
Dale Allen Pfeiffer,

05:20.178 --> 05:22.476
who introduced me to the concept
of peak oil

05:22.514 --> 05:24.379
and the basic issues
about energy

05:24.416 --> 05:25.644
and helped me to realize

05:25.684 --> 05:28.983
that there was a great deal
of evidence in 2001,

05:29.020 --> 05:31.318
not only that peak oil
was very real

05:31.356 --> 05:34.416
but that government agencies
were acting

05:34.459 --> 05:36.825
and responding
as if it was very real.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.693
All plastic is oil.

05:44.736 --> 05:49.139
Most paints, all pesticides
are made from oil.

05:49.174 --> 05:55.238
Everything from toothpaste to
tooth brushes is made from oil.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.272
There are seven gallons of oil
in every tire.

05:58.316 --> 06:02.150
There is nothing anywhere
in any combination

06:02.187 --> 06:06.590
that will replace the edifice
built by fossil fuels.

06:06.624 --> 06:08.489
Nothing.

06:13.598 --> 06:16.192
Peak oil is probably now
very easy to explain,

06:16.234 --> 06:18.168
much easier
than it was a long time ago.

06:18.203 --> 06:23.004
People have felt what
$147 a barrel oil feels like.

06:25.410 --> 06:28.675
Essentially peak oil is like if
you know what a bell curve is.

06:28.713 --> 06:30.442
Goes up, comes down.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.211
Peak oil is the point
of oil production

06:32.250 --> 06:34.184
when you're at the top
of the bell curve.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.551
And essentially
what that means is,

06:36.588 --> 06:40.581
you've used up
half of the resource.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.718
In the case of oil or
any other substance like that,

06:42.761 --> 06:45.457
no matter how much money
you throw at it,

06:45.497 --> 06:47.761
you're never going
to be able to increase

06:47.799 --> 06:50.893
oil production above
where it was at peak.

06:55.707 --> 06:59.006
As of 2008, the International
Energy Agency has admitted

06:59.043 --> 07:03.104
that there is a global 9%
decline rate in oil production.

07:03.148 --> 07:06.879
That's the equivalent of
about 8 million barrels a day.

07:06.918 --> 07:10.285
There is no way, having plucked
all the low-hanging fruit

07:10.321 --> 07:12.186
and found the big reservoirs

07:12.223 --> 07:16.626
that we are gonna able
to offset a 9% decline rate.

07:21.499 --> 07:22.989
From a detective's standpoint,

07:23.034 --> 07:26.197
if you are trying
to assemble a case, you know,

07:26.237 --> 07:28.933
the multidimensional aspects
of a case...

07:28.973 --> 07:30.565
means, motive, opportunity...

07:30.608 --> 07:35.636
to understand what kind of force
drives events,

07:35.680 --> 07:39.776
peak oil was almost
with the stroke

07:39.818 --> 07:41.979
of, like,
a diamond cutter's knife

07:42.020 --> 07:44.215
the single piece which started
to make

07:44.255 --> 07:47.224
everything resonate
and make sense together.

07:49.828 --> 07:52.388
<i>An economy
that runs on petroleum,</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:54.921
<i>some 20 million barrels of it
a day.</i>

07:54.966 --> 07:57.730
You will recall that when the
Bush administration took office

07:57.769 --> 08:00.465
in January of 2001,

08:00.505 --> 08:03.736
a National Energy
Policy Development Group,

08:03.775 --> 08:05.140
the NEPDG, was formed

08:05.176 --> 08:07.770
and placed under
the exclusive, private,

08:07.812 --> 08:11.646
absolute control
of Vice President Dick Cheney.

08:11.683 --> 08:13.082
Its records were kept a secret,

08:13.117 --> 08:15.017
its minutes were kept a secret,

08:15.053 --> 08:18.386
seven pages were released
as a result of two lawsuits,

08:18.423 --> 08:22.154
and it clearly shows that that
task force was looking saying,

08:22.193 --> 08:23.455
"How much oil is there?

08:23.495 --> 08:25.360
Where is it?
Who owns it?"

08:25.396 --> 08:27.125
They knew that this was coming
for a long time.

08:27.165 --> 08:29.395
It has been known
that this event,

08:29.434 --> 08:31.698
this collapse,
this crash, was coming.

08:31.736 --> 08:32.736
<i>Who they were,</i>

08:32.770 --> 08:34.067
<i>we can't even get information</i>

08:34.105 --> 08:36.869
<i>as to who was involved
and what they were doing.</i>

08:36.908 --> 08:39.876
First of all, if you think
there might be oil someplace,

08:39.910 --> 08:41.572
then what you do is,
you go drill a test well.

08:41.613 --> 08:44.104
Then what you have to do

08:44.148 --> 08:45.581
is to take that one well
in the center,

08:45.617 --> 08:48.347
and then you drill a series
of appraisal wells

08:48.386 --> 08:49.580
around that well

08:49.621 --> 08:52.590
to determine where the oil field
might go.

08:52.624 --> 08:54.384
You don't know how much oil
you're gonna get,

08:54.392 --> 08:56.986
how deep it is, what kind of oil
it's gonna to be.

08:57.028 --> 08:58.588
There are many different grades
of oils,

08:58.630 --> 09:01.656
a lot of which
are more expensive to refine.

09:01.699 --> 09:03.894
So all of that has
to do with how long it takes

09:03.935 --> 09:06.130
to make something produce,

09:06.170 --> 09:08.001
how much energy do you get back

09:08.039 --> 09:11.497
for how much energy
you invested.

09:11.543 --> 09:13.875
When oil was seeping out
of the ground in Pennsylvania,

09:13.912 --> 09:17.177
you got a return of,
I don't know, 200 to 1.

09:17.215 --> 09:19.376
When you have to go offshore,

09:19.417 --> 09:23.649
to deep water drilling
in 15,000 feet of water

09:23.688 --> 09:28.591
and your first well costs
$150 million to build,

09:28.626 --> 09:31.186
all that's energy that's being
invested to get energy,

09:31.229 --> 09:32.992
and the moment you start
burning more energy

09:33.031 --> 09:35.192
to get a barrel of oil out
of the ground than it's worth,

09:35.233 --> 09:36.233
forget about it.

09:38.002 --> 09:39.799
The world's been
thoroughly explored

09:39.837 --> 09:41.464
over the last 120 years.

09:41.506 --> 09:43.838
There's no major oil finds left.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.174
As a matter of fact,
no field the size of Ghawar,

09:47.211 --> 09:48.940
the largest field
in Saudi Arabia,

09:48.980 --> 09:50.504
has ever been discovered since.

09:52.850 --> 09:55.148
Saudi Arabia has 25%

09:55.186 --> 09:57.552
of the known oil reserves
on the planet.

09:57.589 --> 09:59.318
25%.

09:59.357 --> 10:02.588
Why, if Saudi Arabia has all
these untapped reserves on shore

10:02.627 --> 10:05.528
are they moving heavily
into offshore drilling?

10:05.563 --> 10:08.691
Now, if it's 5, 10, 50 times
more expensive

10:08.733 --> 10:10.564
to drill offshore than on land,

10:10.602 --> 10:12.263
doesn't that tell you
that Saudi Arabia

10:12.303 --> 10:14.931
knows they've got
no more oil to find?

10:14.973 --> 10:19.273
It's axiomatic that if
Saudi Arabia has passed its peak

10:19.310 --> 10:21.039
and is in decline,
the whole planet is

10:21.079 --> 10:23.343
just because of the size
of the reserves that are there.

10:27.118 --> 10:30.849
Iraq is oil
that's not only accessible,

10:30.888 --> 10:32.617
it's right close
to the Persian Gulf,

10:32.657 --> 10:34.682
which means it's
a short distance to ships.

10:34.726 --> 10:35.852
They can put the pipelines.

10:35.893 --> 10:39.021
They can get that into
the global supply stream

10:39.063 --> 10:41.258
as everything else declines.

10:44.068 --> 10:45.933
And Iraq was all about the oil.

10:45.970 --> 10:50.407
A lot of people have admitted
that, and like, duh.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.467
11 days after 9/11,
when there was no clear evidence

10:53.511 --> 10:55.741
that Saddam Hussein had anything
to do with 9/11...

10:55.780 --> 10:57.008
of course, he didn't...

10:57.048 --> 11:00.449
the plans were started
to invade Iraq, of course.

11:00.485 --> 11:05.081
That was the objective,
get control of that oil.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.216
Because Saddam Hussein
had been talking about

11:07.258 --> 11:10.250
pricing his oil in Euros,
taking it away from the dollar.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.318
We got in there.

11:11.362 --> 11:12.624
We restructured everything.

11:12.664 --> 11:15.224
We put in a friendly government
using the U.S. dollar,

11:15.266 --> 11:18.326
and we assured the oil companies

11:18.369 --> 11:22.806
their "fair access"
and fair share of Iraqi oil.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.469
<i>International oil companies
into Iraqi oil fields</i>

11:26.511 --> 11:28.411
We have no intention
of leaving Iraq.

11:28.446 --> 11:31.074
We're never gonna leave Iraq.

11:31.115 --> 11:33.743
Going back to 2004,
we started building the largest,

11:33.785 --> 11:37.016
most permanent military bases,
three of them, in the world,

11:37.055 --> 11:39.990
plus the largest embassy
compound that's ever been built.

11:40.024 --> 11:43.118
We built an embassy compound
in Baghdad

11:43.161 --> 11:45.823
that's bigger than Vatican City.

11:45.863 --> 11:50.527
That's not a temporary deal.

11:50.568 --> 11:52.160
Nobody is gonna take that oil.

11:52.203 --> 11:55.639
We are sitting on it.

11:55.673 --> 12:00.110
But there is not enough oil
in Iraq to change anything.

12:00.144 --> 12:03.136
Iraq probably has around
90 billion barrels

12:03.181 --> 12:04.239
of recoverable oil.

12:04.282 --> 12:06.273
That sounds like a lot of oil.

12:06.317 --> 12:08.877
But when you consider that in
2008 the world was consuming

12:08.920 --> 12:10.478
85 million barrels a day,

12:10.521 --> 12:11.886
that means
a billion barrels of oil

12:11.923 --> 12:13.550
only last for about 111/2 days,

12:13.591 --> 12:14.888
so that ain't that much oil.

12:14.926 --> 12:16.486
<i>That's only the first
of the good things</i>

12:16.527 --> 12:18.893
<i>that will come to Iraq,
thanks to oil.</i>

12:21.999 --> 12:24.627
They knew exactly
what was coming.

12:24.669 --> 12:26.762
That's what's in
the National Energy Policy

12:26.804 --> 12:29.136
Development Group report
that's been classified,

12:29.173 --> 12:31.471
because if that report
were declassified,

12:31.509 --> 12:34.876
we would be building scaffolds
to hang Dick Cheney

12:34.912 --> 12:36.846
and everybody in that
administration tomorrow.

12:41.853 --> 12:44.151
Let's assume
just for the sake of discussion

12:44.188 --> 12:47.715
that there's 600 billion barrels
in the Arctic.

12:47.759 --> 12:51.320
First of all, it happens
to be under the polar ice cap.

12:51.362 --> 12:52.795
That's a problem.

12:52.830 --> 12:55.663
The polar ice cap happens to be
on, what, 10,000,

12:55.700 --> 12:58.328
15,000 feet water.

12:58.369 --> 13:01.497
The problem with the polar ice
cap is, it floats; it moves.

13:01.539 --> 13:03.632
So you can't drill a well
on Tuesday

13:03.674 --> 13:06.438
and expect it to be in
the same place on Thursday.

13:06.477 --> 13:10.470
That's why a lot of conservative
think tanks and oil companies

13:10.515 --> 13:14.918
are cheering the melting
of the polar ice caps.

13:14.952 --> 13:17.978
<i>Developing this tiny section
of ANWR,</i>

13:18.022 --> 13:20.013
<i>could eventually yield up
to a million...</i>

13:20.057 --> 13:21.581
If there is oil in ANWR

13:21.626 --> 13:24.356
there's no more than about
a six-month supply

13:24.395 --> 13:26.829
for the entire United States.

13:26.864 --> 13:29.298
There are no pipelines
across a thousand miles

13:29.333 --> 13:31.563
of tundra that's melting due
to global warming,

13:31.602 --> 13:34.002
which means you can't sink pipes
to support

13:34.038 --> 13:37.337
a pipeline in tundra
that's turned to mud.

13:37.375 --> 13:40.435
There's no tanker routes,
the wells aren't drilled,

13:40.478 --> 13:46.417
and yet we are spending our
future as if that oil is there.

13:48.486 --> 13:52.115
We got to drop all this lying
right now.

13:52.156 --> 13:54.351
We don't need transparency
about anything

13:54.392 --> 13:57.384
other than about
how much oil is really left,

13:57.428 --> 13:58.895
because we don't know.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.488
Oil is a commodity;
it's an asset.

14:00.531 --> 14:02.692
You make loans based upon
what's in the ground,

14:02.733 --> 14:04.598
so you have all these
accounting terms:

14:04.635 --> 14:07.103
possible reserves,
proven reserves,

14:07.138 --> 14:09.003
ultimately recoverable reserves,

14:09.040 --> 14:11.565
verified reserves, estimated...

14:11.609 --> 14:14.271
But actual reserve estimates
are state secrets.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.803
The Saudis don't dare announce
that they've passed

14:16.848 --> 14:17.940
their peak of oil production.

14:17.982 --> 14:18.982
Why?

14:19.016 --> 14:21.541
They have a very
restive population

14:21.586 --> 14:23.611
that have been sold
an expectation

14:23.654 --> 14:25.417
of a rising standard of living,

14:25.456 --> 14:27.947
and the moment Saudi Arabia
acknowledges it's past peak,

14:27.992 --> 14:29.789
it may well have a revolution.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.921
Now, what happens if there's
a revolution in Saudi Arabia

14:32.964 --> 14:35.023
with 25% of the world's
known oil?

14:35.066 --> 14:36.826
Where is that oil going
to get replaced from?

14:36.834 --> 14:39.564
It can't be.

14:39.604 --> 14:40.628
Very complex problem.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.639
It's a very complex situation.

14:47.378 --> 14:49.505
<i>Just start working now,
otherwise we won't have time.</i>

14:49.547 --> 14:52.641
<i>We're gonna be out
of oil within a few years.</i>

14:52.683 --> 14:56.084
<i>In doing this sort of pulling
archival footage for this film,</i>

14:56.120 --> 15:00.056
<i>I found at least ten examples
of people in the late '70s</i>

15:00.091 --> 15:01.991
<i>talking about,
this is the end of oil.</i>

15:02.026 --> 15:04.392
<i>This is, like,
end of a way of life,</i>

15:04.428 --> 15:05.656
<i>we are hitting a new era.</i>

15:05.696 --> 15:07.687
<i>This situation is destined
to continue.</i>

15:07.732 --> 15:09.290
<i>People look at that footage,</i>

15:09.333 --> 15:12.666
<i>and I think they can feel
that it's somewhat alarmist,</i>

15:12.703 --> 15:14.500
<i>given that we were able
to continue</i>

15:14.538 --> 15:18.372
<i>our way of life
for another 30, 35 years.</i>

15:18.409 --> 15:22.140
<i>Do you see any parallels
between that time and now?</i>

15:27.451 --> 15:31.751
The '70s was really
a critical decade.

15:31.789 --> 15:34.656
In the '70s,
Marion King Hubbard,

15:34.692 --> 15:37.593
the original prophet
of peak oil,

15:37.628 --> 15:40.426
in late 1949 he did the math

15:40.464 --> 15:44.730
and said U.S. domestic oil
production will peak in 1970.

15:44.769 --> 15:48.569
So that's not some feat
of Nostradamus

15:48.606 --> 15:50.631
communicating with some entity.

15:50.675 --> 15:53.337
It's math; it's science;
it's simple.

15:53.377 --> 15:57.006
But in the '70s, M. King Hubbard
testified before Congress.

15:57.048 --> 15:58.879
That was 1974.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.942
In 1976,
President Jimmy Carter said,

16:01.986 --> 16:05.820
"Man, we cannot use as much
energy as we have been using."

16:05.856 --> 16:07.289
<i>To use energy more efficiently.</i>

16:07.325 --> 16:08.724
That's when solar panels
went up.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.386
That's when he start... he knew.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.123
They have known in Washington.

16:12.163 --> 16:13.460
I have...

16:13.497 --> 16:17.092
I have published on my website,
as have others,

16:17.134 --> 16:20.433
declassified CIA documents
from 1976

16:20.471 --> 16:24.373
showing that CIA was perfectly
aware of peak oil.

16:24.408 --> 16:26.069
In those days, of course,

16:26.110 --> 16:29.011
when the situation appeared
to be normal,

16:29.046 --> 16:31.037
when people had jobs,
they had vacations,

16:31.082 --> 16:32.845
they had credit cards,
they had credit lines,

16:32.883 --> 16:34.874
everybody is talking about
growth, growth, growth,

16:34.919 --> 16:37.149
buy, buy, buy,
spend, consume, consume,

16:37.188 --> 16:38.815
and everything seemed
to be working,

16:38.856 --> 16:42.087
yeah, we were called alarmists.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.287
We don't live
in that world anymore.

16:47.331 --> 16:52.894
<i>Americans were on the way
to owning millions of cars.</i>

16:52.937 --> 16:55.565
800 million internal
combustion-powered vehicles

16:55.606 --> 16:57.198
on the planet.

16:57.241 --> 16:59.505
They all run on oil.

16:59.543 --> 17:02.979
It takes uncounted barrels
of oil

17:03.014 --> 17:06.575
to make those cars and engines
in the first place,

17:06.617 --> 17:09.347
and you cannot plug
any new technology

17:09.387 --> 17:12.253
into an internal combustion
powered engine.

17:12.289 --> 17:14.450
With seven gallons of oil
in every tire,

17:14.492 --> 17:15.685
nobody will ever make

17:15.726 --> 17:18.661
800 million new
internal combustion anything

17:18.695 --> 17:20.630
because there ain't gonna be
enough oil.

17:23.934 --> 17:27.768
Ethanol is an absolute...

17:27.805 --> 17:28.965
joke.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.938
First of all, a very brilliant
scientist, David Pimentel,

17:33.978 --> 17:36.242
took the concept of net energy,

17:36.280 --> 17:37.645
how much energy do you invest

17:37.681 --> 17:40.206
versus how much
do you get in return,

17:40.251 --> 17:44.244
and he concluded
about a decade ago, I guess,

17:44.288 --> 17:47.553
that it takes more energy
to make ethanol

17:47.591 --> 17:50.924
than you get from burning it,
which is absolute stupidity.

17:50.961 --> 17:53.759
Because you drive the
oil-powered machines, etcetera,

17:53.798 --> 17:55.561
you irrigate,
you use the fertilizers,

17:55.599 --> 17:58.568
you're burning all that oil
and natural gas to grow it.

17:58.602 --> 18:00.570
Then you make steam which is...

18:00.604 --> 18:02.265
which is more
hydrocarbon energy,

18:02.306 --> 18:03.705
you add more chemicals,

18:03.741 --> 18:06.574
and you come up with ethanol,
which you can put in a car.

18:06.610 --> 18:10.512
Now, the Bush administration
had announced a goal

18:10.548 --> 18:14.143
of having 15% of all fuel
in the United States

18:14.185 --> 18:17.450
made from ethanol, I think,
by the year 2015.

18:17.488 --> 18:18.887
They forgot to tell you that

18:18.923 --> 18:22.017
that would take all the arable
land used to grow corn to do it.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.457
Canadian tar sands is an oil.

18:26.497 --> 18:33.369
It is a very, very thick,
sticky, obnoxious substance

18:33.404 --> 18:35.668
that's mixed in with sand

18:35.706 --> 18:40.075
at levels 200, 300, 400,
500 feet in layers

18:40.111 --> 18:41.111
beneath the soil.

18:41.145 --> 18:42.544
This is in Alberta.

18:42.580 --> 18:47.415
And they literally strip mine
thousands of tons a day.

18:47.451 --> 18:49.749
They put them in these huge,
oil-powered dump trucks

18:49.787 --> 18:53.245
and drive them to a place
where they then wash the sand.

18:53.290 --> 18:57.283
They take millions and billions
of gallons of fresh water,

18:57.328 --> 18:59.193
which we're running
out of everywhere,

18:59.230 --> 19:02.165
and they boil it
by burning natural gas.

19:02.199 --> 19:05.464
There is not
a possibility anywhere

19:05.503 --> 19:07.494
that Canadian tar sand's
production

19:07.538 --> 19:10.974
will exceed maybe 3 million,
3.5 million barrels a day.

19:13.244 --> 19:15.235
The first thing
that the uneducated mind

19:15.279 --> 19:16.769
that's in denial says,

19:16.814 --> 19:18.042
"Well, what about hydrogen?

19:18.082 --> 19:19.344
Can't we make electric cars?"

19:19.383 --> 19:20.873
Then I have to bring them back
to the fact

19:20.918 --> 19:22.886
that there's seven gallons
of oil in every tire,

19:22.920 --> 19:26.412
that there are thousands
of gallons of oil in every car,

19:26.457 --> 19:29.119
in the plastics, the paints,
the resins, everything.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.354
All of that is made by oil.

19:30.394 --> 19:32.034
The oil that's used
to manufacture the car

19:32.062 --> 19:34.758
and ship it around, to heat
the metals, etcetera, etcetera.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.928
There will never be 800 million
electric powered vehicles,

19:38.969 --> 19:42.905
and electricity is not
an energy source.

19:42.940 --> 19:45.966
Electricity is generated
by burning

19:46.010 --> 19:48.979
or using some other kind
of energy.

19:55.653 --> 19:59.885
<i>Today freedom and power
are woven together.</i>

19:59.924 --> 20:03.917
<i>The invisible battalions
of electric power...</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:08.521
It's clear that electricity

20:08.566 --> 20:10.761
is the key
to industrial civilization

20:10.801 --> 20:13.702
in that it powers
our refrigeration.

20:13.737 --> 20:16.297
It runs the water pumps
that pump water out

20:16.340 --> 20:18.900
of the New York subway
system every day.

20:18.943 --> 20:21.275
It allows us
to commute electronically,

20:21.312 --> 20:23.075
charge our cell phone batteries,

20:23.113 --> 20:27.743
preserve food,
run operating rooms, etcetera.

20:30.588 --> 20:34.922
The subject
of alternative energies.

20:38.095 --> 20:42.725
There is no such thing
as clean coal,

20:42.766 --> 20:45.257
and there never ever will be.

20:45.302 --> 20:46.929
Why?

20:46.971 --> 20:49.701
Carbon sequestration
is enormously expensive.

20:49.740 --> 20:52.174
What it says essentially is,
you capture the CO2

20:52.209 --> 20:54.871
and any other
greenhouse gases emitted

20:54.912 --> 20:56.675
in the burning of the coal,

20:56.714 --> 21:00.946
you exert enormous amounts
of energy to compress it,

21:00.985 --> 21:04.614
then you move it over
enormously long distances,

21:04.655 --> 21:09.115
and you pump it into some
airtight chamber in the ground

21:09.159 --> 21:11.992
where somebody will figure out
with technology

21:12.029 --> 21:13.826
what to do with
the greenhouse gas in 10,000

21:13.864 --> 21:15.297
or 15,000 thousand years.

21:17.001 --> 21:19.196
Nuclear process
requires something

21:19.236 --> 21:21.397
like 10 to 13 years
of incubation

21:21.438 --> 21:24.896
to get the permitting done,
all the regulations satisfied,

21:24.942 --> 21:27.274
and the construction
of nuclear power plants

21:27.311 --> 21:29.643
is one of the most
energy-intensive processes

21:29.680 --> 21:30.908
in the world.

21:30.948 --> 21:32.882
The steel, the lead containment,

21:32.916 --> 21:36.443
the enrichment of uranium
is a horribly intensive process.

21:36.487 --> 21:38.455
You just don't throw
a rock of uranium in

21:38.489 --> 21:40.013
and start making nuclear energy.

21:40.057 --> 21:41.057
Can't do that.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.593
The first and obvious
problem with tidal energy is,

21:44.628 --> 21:49.327
it has to be generated
or collected near a coastline.

21:49.366 --> 21:51.857
Salt water
is extremely corrosive.

21:51.902 --> 21:56.896
There's an enormous energy cost
in manufacturing the machines.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.408
There are only two
alternative energies

21:59.443 --> 22:03.038
which can really have
an immediate impact,

22:03.080 --> 22:05.071
an immediate benefit.

22:08.218 --> 22:11.210
Now, the problem with plans
like enormous wind farms

22:11.255 --> 22:14.622
in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado,

22:14.658 --> 22:16.285
the fundamental law
with electricity is,

22:16.327 --> 22:20.593
is that it's drawn off
right where it's used first.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.600
Yes, you can transmit
electricity over long distances,

22:23.634 --> 22:25.465
but people don't think
about the energy

22:25.502 --> 22:26.764
that goes into transformers,

22:26.804 --> 22:28.931
and how much copper
is in power lines,

22:28.972 --> 22:31.805
and all the maintenance
that has to go to that grid.

22:31.842 --> 22:35.403
So when you see really
ridiculous commercials

22:35.446 --> 22:40.577
that say we could have a solar
array 96 miles in the desert,

22:40.617 --> 22:42.278
they don't even think about
the fact

22:42.319 --> 22:44.685
that that electricity is going
to get used in California

22:44.722 --> 22:46.587
before it goes any place else.

22:50.794 --> 22:52.557
<i>Just, you know,
if you saw this movie</i>

22:52.596 --> 22:54.496
<i>and you didn't know
who you were,</i>

22:54.531 --> 22:55.930
<i>and you wanted...</i>

22:55.966 --> 22:57.831
<i>you were just curious
what your credentials are</i>

22:57.868 --> 23:02.601
<i>in terms of understanding
this information.</i>

23:07.111 --> 23:11.309
I have a bachelors degree
in political science

23:11.348 --> 23:16.809
with honors from UCLA, 1973.

23:16.854 --> 23:21.484
Graduate of the Los Angeles
Police Academy, Valedictorian,

23:21.525 --> 23:24.460
class of 1173,

23:24.495 --> 23:29.364
was sent to do DEA Narcotics
Enforcement School by LAPD.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.995
I have 30 years of experience
as an investigative journalist.

23:33.036 --> 23:37.769
I've broken major scandals
that have had national impact.

23:37.808 --> 23:40.834
Of course, I got to know
many members of Congress.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.904
I had been trying to testify
for a long time,

23:43.947 --> 23:46.381
and actually I have
never testified in Congress.

23:46.417 --> 23:47.748
I did, at the request of

23:47.785 --> 23:49.582
the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence,

23:49.620 --> 23:51.212
submit written testimony,

23:51.255 --> 23:52.984
but after they read
the written testimony

23:53.023 --> 23:54.047
that I was going to submit,

23:54.091 --> 23:56.025
I never got a call to testify.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.526
I have written two books,

23:57.561 --> 24:00.428
one of which is in the
Harvard Business School library.

24:00.464 --> 24:04.059
I've lectured at universities
all over the country

24:04.101 --> 24:06.035
and in many countries.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.536
People wonder, you know,

24:07.571 --> 24:10.972
how this guy with
a bachelors degree from UCLA

24:11.008 --> 24:12.202
came to know all this shit.

24:12.242 --> 24:16.542
Well, this comes from 30 years
of learning

24:16.580 --> 24:19.674
how to scan mainstream media
and read it,

24:19.716 --> 24:23.516
a way of finding stories
from around the world

24:23.554 --> 24:27.285
that tell you all the things
that are really going on

24:27.324 --> 24:30.851
that are not played
on the headlines...

24:30.894 --> 24:32.293
but they're the kind of stories

24:32.329 --> 24:37.028
that people who really make
decisions know how to look for...

24:37.067 --> 24:40.059
and then how to connect them,

24:40.103 --> 24:42.333
how to place the dots
close enough together

24:42.372 --> 24:43.839
so that they can be connected.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.350
The soil is the place from which

25:03.393 --> 25:07.227
all plant matter
gets its nutrients,

25:07.264 --> 25:09.528
and if you keep sucking
the nutrients out,

25:09.566 --> 25:11.591
the soil is useless.

25:11.635 --> 25:15.401
For all of history,
the way the soil was replenished

25:15.439 --> 25:18.875
and the nutrients were returned
in some measure to the soil

25:18.909 --> 25:21.104
was that plant matter
was allowed to decay,

25:21.144 --> 25:24.272
to compost, to restock the soil.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.509
That's why crop rotation
is so important.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.142
You may have one crop of celery

25:28.185 --> 25:31.643
which will suck certain
chemicals out of the soil.

25:31.688 --> 25:34.782
Another crop,
wheat or something else,

25:34.825 --> 25:37.419
may return those same chemicals
to the soil.

25:37.461 --> 25:39.725
So the soil maintains a balance.

25:45.602 --> 25:48.162
It's kind of sad,
because we as a species

25:48.205 --> 25:50.833
have become so disconnected
from the earth.

25:50.874 --> 25:52.899
We don't have any
real contact with the earth.

25:52.943 --> 25:54.877
We don't have any sense
of its functions,

25:54.912 --> 25:57.380
its feel, its nature,
its seasons, its timing.

25:59.616 --> 26:03.484
First of all, the topsoil
on which food is grown now

26:03.520 --> 26:07.354
is nothing more than a sponge
onto which we pour chemicals

26:07.391 --> 26:10.053
that we get from oil
and natural gas,

26:10.093 --> 26:11.754
and without those chemicals...

26:11.795 --> 26:13.763
the soil has been turned
into a junkie;

26:13.797 --> 26:17.426
the soil is worthless.

26:17.467 --> 26:19.367
So when you plant a crop now,

26:19.403 --> 26:22.031
what happens is you drive
an oil-powered machine.

26:22.072 --> 26:24.199
Drives along, and it plows.

26:24.241 --> 26:27.005
Then you drive another
oil-powered machine,

26:27.044 --> 26:29.740
and it drives along,
and it plants.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.304
And then you irrigate.

26:31.348 --> 26:32.388
Well, how do you irrigate?

26:32.416 --> 26:34.816
Well, that water is pumped
by pumps

26:34.851 --> 26:36.341
that are powered by electricity.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.013
Where's that electricity
come from?

26:38.055 --> 26:41.183
In the United States,
it's either coal or natural gas.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.885
So next thing you do
is come along,

26:42.926 --> 26:44.154
and you fertilize it.

26:44.194 --> 26:48.062
All commercial fertilizers
are made from ammonia,

26:48.098 --> 26:52.899
and the feedstock for ammonia
is natural gas.

26:52.936 --> 26:55.427
So you have ammonium nitrate
fertilizers

26:55.472 --> 26:58.441
that are then sprayed on
by another oil-powered vehicle.

26:58.475 --> 27:01.638
Then the crop dusters come along
that are powered by oil

27:01.678 --> 27:06.377
that spray pesticides that are
all made from petroleum.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.680
Then when it's time to harvest
the food, what do you do?

27:08.719 --> 27:10.277
You drive another
oil-powered machine,

27:10.320 --> 27:11.719
and you harvest it.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.656
You use another oil-powered
machine to drive it to a place

27:14.691 --> 27:16.215
where it's processed.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.250
Then you wrap it up in plastic,
which is oil,

27:18.295 --> 27:20.286
and you put it in
another oil-powered machine,

27:20.330 --> 27:22.355
and you drive it X number
of miles

27:22.399 --> 27:24.060
to a food distribution warehouse

27:24.101 --> 27:26.228
and an oil-powered machine
to your supermarket.

27:31.241 --> 27:33.368
The way food is grown, produced,

27:33.410 --> 27:34.968
and moved around
the world today,

27:35.012 --> 27:37.003
it's an enormous waste
of hydrocarbon energy

27:37.047 --> 27:38.742
which doesn't make sense.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.807
Why do we have strawberries
from Chile?

27:40.851 --> 27:42.614
Why do we have
spinach from China?

27:42.653 --> 27:44.746
Why do we ship anchovies
halfway around the world

27:44.788 --> 27:49.248
to be packaged in tin cans?

27:49.292 --> 27:53.991
There are ten calories
of hydrocarbon energy

27:54.031 --> 27:57.228
in every calorie
of food consumed

27:57.267 --> 27:58.700
in the industrialized world.

28:07.778 --> 28:11.714
Three times in my life

28:11.748 --> 28:17.812
I tried to walk away from,
forget about,

28:17.854 --> 28:20.118
the things that I had seen

28:20.157 --> 28:24.093
that were so out of whack,

28:24.127 --> 28:27.790
that were so crazy,
that were so wrong.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.732
You know, and that is what
many people urged me to do.

28:30.767 --> 28:33.531
But what inevitably happened
every time

28:33.570 --> 28:38.439
I tried to walk away from this
path that I have walked

28:38.475 --> 28:39.999
was that everything else
in my life

28:40.043 --> 28:41.203
would be taken away from me

28:41.244 --> 28:44.441
so that this path
was the only thing left.

28:44.481 --> 28:46.847
I had no other choice.

28:46.883 --> 28:50.649
And, yeah, anger and resentment
do build up,

28:50.687 --> 28:54.248
especially when you see
and document as much corruption,

28:54.291 --> 28:55.519
as much dishonesty,

28:55.559 --> 28:59.222
as much illegality,
as much murder, as much betrayal

28:59.262 --> 29:04.791
as I have from people
who pretend to be otherwise.

29:04.835 --> 29:06.029
And I reached a point...

29:06.069 --> 29:09.869
it was about 1993
when I first became involved

29:09.906 --> 29:13.672
or learned of the murder
of Marine Colonel Jim Sabow

29:13.710 --> 29:15.701
at El Toro Marine Air Station.

29:15.746 --> 29:18.840
He was the chief of Air Ops,
and he had caught CIA C130s

29:18.882 --> 29:21.680
flying 2,000 and 3,000 kilos
of cocaine on to his base,

29:21.718 --> 29:24.118
and he was suicided.

29:24.154 --> 29:26.179
I crossed my own Rubicon
at that point.

29:26.223 --> 29:30.216
There was no turning
back for me,

29:30.260 --> 29:32.592
and I knew that wherever
this path was gonna go,

29:32.629 --> 29:33.789
I had to follow it.

29:38.435 --> 29:42.371
In the '80s, because I had
some skill as a writer,

29:42.405 --> 29:44.396
I started freelance writing.

29:44.441 --> 29:45.703
I got published a few times.

29:45.742 --> 29:49.371
I realized
that I could be a writer.

29:49.412 --> 29:54.577
I wrote about 109 mysterious
deaths or suicides

29:54.618 --> 29:56.950
in the U.S. military
in a very short period of time,

29:56.987 --> 30:00.889
and I found that most of those
were connected

30:00.924 --> 30:05.293
to covert operations
in one way or another.

30:05.328 --> 30:07.523
The next real evolution
came in 1996

30:07.564 --> 30:10.658
after my confrontation
with CIA Director Deutch,

30:10.700 --> 30:13.032
John Deutch
at Locke High School.

30:13.069 --> 30:16.470
You know, I remember standing up
saying something like,

30:16.506 --> 30:19.498
"I am a former Los Angeles
police narcotics detective.

30:19.543 --> 30:21.067
"I worked South Central
Los Angeles,

30:21.111 --> 30:22.551
"and I can tell you,
Director Deutch,

30:22.579 --> 30:24.206
"emphatically
and without equivocation

30:24.247 --> 30:26.772
"that the agency
has dealt drugs in this country

30:26.817 --> 30:27.817
for a long time,"

30:27.851 --> 30:30.547
and the room exploded.

30:33.557 --> 30:36.253
I had been saying that CIA
was dealing drugs for 18 years.

30:36.293 --> 30:37.817
I mean, I'd been shot at for it.

30:37.861 --> 30:39.351
I'd been forced out of LAPD.

30:39.396 --> 30:40.396
I'd been trashed.

30:40.430 --> 30:41.829
I'd been called crazy.

30:41.865 --> 30:43.856
<i>If, in the course
of the IG's investigations</i>

30:43.900 --> 30:45.367
<i>and Fred Hinson's work,</i>

30:45.402 --> 30:48.860
<i>you come across evidence
of severely criminal activity,</i>

30:48.905 --> 30:53.672
<i>will you tell
the American people the truth?</i>

30:53.710 --> 30:57.111
<i>We will bring the people
to justice</i>

30:57.147 --> 30:58.444
<i>and make them accountable.</i>

30:58.481 --> 31:00.176
Like so often,
when they promise justice,

31:00.217 --> 31:01.217
there isn't any.

31:01.251 --> 31:03.151
It was whittled
and tweetered down.

31:03.186 --> 31:05.950
There were some
very mysterious deaths involved.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.014
Congressmen Julian Dixon,
who was at that meeting,

31:08.058 --> 31:12.427
had a very sudden
heart attack...

31:12.462 --> 31:15.795
which led to the publishing of
the first issue of my newsletter

31:15.832 --> 31:18.232
<i>in May of 1998,
From the Wilderness.</i>

31:18.268 --> 31:21.931
I sat down
and wrote a few pages out,

31:21.972 --> 31:23.303
like, eight pages I think.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.831
I mailed it to 68 names,

31:25.876 --> 31:27.468
and over the next 81/2 years,

31:27.510 --> 31:30.536
<i>From the Wilderness grew to have</i>

31:30.580 --> 31:35.279
as many as 60 members
of Congress as subscribers,

31:35.318 --> 31:37.513
professors at universities
around the world,

31:37.554 --> 31:40.523
government officials.

31:40.557 --> 31:42.821
One of my first exposés
after CIA and drugs

31:42.859 --> 31:45.225
was that I proved CNN
was absolutely lying

31:45.262 --> 31:48.789
in something called
the Tailwind Scandal of 1998

31:48.832 --> 31:50.629
where CNN had
correctly reported...

31:50.667 --> 31:52.532
their producer April Oliver
had reported

31:52.569 --> 31:55.367
that CIA had used sarin gas
in Laos

31:55.405 --> 31:56.405
during the Vietnam War,

31:56.439 --> 31:57.838
and Henry Kissinger
authorized it.

31:57.874 --> 32:01.002
<i>Four different A-1
pilots who dropped the gas.</i>

32:01.044 --> 32:03.035
<i>In spite of
what the Pentagon said.</i>

32:03.079 --> 32:04.979
CNN, you know, rolled over.

32:05.015 --> 32:06.209
Henry Kissinger called.

32:06.249 --> 32:10.515
Oliver was fired.

32:10.553 --> 32:14.649
Pat Tillman series
that I broke in my newsletter.

32:14.691 --> 32:18.149
All seven parts, that was what
broke the Pat Tillman exposé

32:18.194 --> 32:22.062
that brought down nine officers
or got them disciplined.

32:22.098 --> 32:25.625
<i>The government violated
its most basic responsibility.</i>

32:25.669 --> 32:28.934
But my
economic predictions then,

32:28.972 --> 32:29.972
we had it so right.

32:30.006 --> 32:31.837
<i>The problems are several-fold</i>

32:31.875 --> 32:33.570
<i>behind the economic crash
that is coming</i>

32:33.610 --> 32:37.546
<i>that will be nothing
like we have ever seen before.</i>

32:37.580 --> 32:42.574
In 2006, we said,
"Get out of debt right now.

32:42.619 --> 32:44.109
"Check your mortgage carefully,

32:44.154 --> 32:46.679
"especially if you have
an A.R.M.

32:46.723 --> 32:47.985
"Get into gold.

32:48.024 --> 32:50.686
"Reduce debt
as much as possible.

32:50.727 --> 32:52.922
"Stay away from any kind
of financing

32:52.963 --> 32:54.362
and heavy credit card."

32:54.397 --> 32:56.422
We issued a whole series
of warnings.

32:56.466 --> 32:58.093
<i>How many people have ever heard
of the fact</i>

32:58.134 --> 33:00.500
<i>that they're trading pools
of mortgage-backed securities?</i>

33:00.537 --> 33:03.165
<i>Like mutual funds,
but it's all mortgages.</i>

33:03.206 --> 33:05.902
<i>Those books are as cooked
as the books on Enron.</i>

33:05.942 --> 33:07.569
But it was like 11, 12 days

33:07.610 --> 33:09.475
after we issued
that economic alert

33:09.512 --> 33:11.192
in the middle of running
the Tillman series

33:11.214 --> 33:13.148
that our offices
were burglarized.

33:13.183 --> 33:15.651
All seven computers smashed

33:15.685 --> 33:17.915
and a whole chain of events
took place up there

33:17.954 --> 33:21.583
which was... which actually
worked out okay,

33:21.624 --> 33:25.924
because I needed to evolve,
and I have since then.

33:31.434 --> 33:33.959
There was a period after,
you know, so many years

33:34.004 --> 33:37.064
of deliberate attempts
to sabotage my operations,

33:37.107 --> 33:41.009
four of which we connected in
one way or another to the FBI.

33:44.514 --> 33:47.244
I published that I had retired.

33:47.283 --> 33:51.049
I said officially
that I had retired.

33:51.087 --> 33:54.989
What I had... and at that point,
given the way I felt,

33:55.025 --> 34:01.191
that was
a pretty honest statement.

34:01.231 --> 34:02.926
I didn't know
that I would bounce back

34:02.966 --> 34:05.264
or that there was a third
or a fourth wind

34:05.301 --> 34:06.734
to come inside of me,

34:06.770 --> 34:11.571
but that also is the image
that I wanted out there

34:11.608 --> 34:13.007
just to take the heat off me

34:13.043 --> 34:15.909
at least until Bush and Cheney
got out of the White House,

34:15.945 --> 34:18.708
because that's where
the heat was coming from.

34:20.784 --> 34:22.012
<i>From them personally?</i>

34:22.052 --> 34:23.451
<i>I mean,
from their administration,</i>

34:23.485 --> 34:25.716
<i>or, you know, the people
that ran the CIA,</i>

34:25.755 --> 34:27.245
<i>that ran the FBI?</i>

34:27.290 --> 34:29.485
<i>Who was that pressure
coming from?</i>

34:29.525 --> 34:32.984
I have absolutely no doubt
that Richard Cheney

34:33.029 --> 34:36.829
and Donald Rumsfeld took an
intense personal interest in me

34:36.866 --> 34:38.493
and what my newsletter
had published

34:38.534 --> 34:41.163
for all the years
of the Bush Administration.

34:41.204 --> 34:44.605
That's about as specific
as I care to get.

34:51.514 --> 34:55.678
There was a guy named
von Clausewitz

34:55.717 --> 34:58.278
who said that war
is a continuation of politics

34:58.321 --> 35:00.448
by other means.

35:00.490 --> 35:04.824
Politics is a continuation
of economics by other means.

35:08.998 --> 35:12.661
To understand all of this mess,
you need to understand one term.

35:12.702 --> 35:15.136
It's a big financial term that
is real simple to understand.

35:15.171 --> 35:17.139
It's called a derivative.

35:17.173 --> 35:21.667
A derivative is
any financial instrument

35:21.711 --> 35:24.544
which is derived
from the inherent value

35:24.581 --> 35:27.209
of something else
that is tangible.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.083
In other words,
an ear of corn has value.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.145
A barrel of oil has value.

35:32.188 --> 35:35.157
If you have a house
and a mortgage, that's fine.

35:35.191 --> 35:37.591
When you start doing
mortgage-backed securities,

35:37.627 --> 35:40.061
packaging, and bundling,
that's called a derivative.

35:44.367 --> 35:46.631
As of the start of the collapse,

35:46.669 --> 35:50.332
which let's peg
at September of 2008,

35:50.373 --> 35:54.241
there were derivatives
with a notional value,

35:54.277 --> 35:56.268
meaning that if you added up
all the pieces of paper,

35:56.312 --> 36:00.146
were worth $700 trillion.

36:00.183 --> 36:02.174
In other words,
if they all cashed out at once,

36:02.218 --> 36:04.448
you would need to have
$700 trillion in cash,

36:04.487 --> 36:06.250
and of course,
there isn't that much money.

36:10.493 --> 36:13.951
So with all of these hedges and
derivatives and puts and calls,

36:13.997 --> 36:15.055
those are all derivatives,

36:15.098 --> 36:17.225
and all these other things
they do,

36:17.267 --> 36:19.587
all they cared about was making
the minimum monthly payment

36:19.602 --> 36:20.762
on the credit card bill.

36:20.803 --> 36:24.000
In other words, to service
the $700 trillion

36:24.040 --> 36:26.201
in notional-valued derivatives,

36:26.242 --> 36:28.642
they had to pay a certain amount
of cash every month,

36:28.678 --> 36:30.407
and God forbid they should
all come due.

36:30.446 --> 36:32.505
What's happening
with all of these bailouts,

36:32.549 --> 36:35.245
which are now around
$11 trillion

36:35.285 --> 36:38.118
if you add up
all the U.S. bailouts,

36:38.154 --> 36:42.113
they're chasing a $700 trillion
derivatives bubble

36:42.158 --> 36:44.888
down the drain.

36:59.075 --> 37:03.409
The people who have run
the monetary paradigm,

37:03.446 --> 37:06.506
the economic paradigm,
since money was first invented

37:06.549 --> 37:07.982
have wanted to mystify it

37:08.017 --> 37:09.507
and to make everybody believe

37:09.552 --> 37:12.646
that only some expert could
understand the mumbo jumbo

37:12.689 --> 37:15.249
of the priesthood of money.

37:15.291 --> 37:17.452
Three things only anybody
needs to know

37:17.493 --> 37:19.620
about the way money works
around the world today.

37:19.662 --> 37:21.289
Fiat currency.

37:21.331 --> 37:22.331
What is money?

37:24.968 --> 37:28.961
If I were to take a bill
out of my wallet,

37:29.005 --> 37:32.065
and I reach in my wallet,
and I pull out this bill,

37:32.108 --> 37:33.541
it's $20.

37:33.576 --> 37:35.168
Wow. Okay.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.735
Can I eat it?

37:36.779 --> 37:37.973
Can I roll it up and chew it?

37:38.014 --> 37:39.777
Do I get calories and vitamins?

37:39.816 --> 37:40.942
No, I don't.

37:40.984 --> 37:42.815
Can I crumple it up,

37:42.852 --> 37:44.251
throw it in my gas tank?

37:44.287 --> 37:45.618
Is the car gonna go anywhere?

37:45.655 --> 37:48.419
No, it's gonna clog
the fuel injectors, maybe.

37:48.458 --> 37:50.392
This is only a symbol.

37:50.426 --> 37:52.087
This doesn't mean anything.

37:52.128 --> 37:53.128
It's fiat.

37:53.162 --> 37:54.424
It's created out of thin air

37:54.464 --> 37:56.455
because somebody turned on
a printing press.

37:56.499 --> 38:00.128
That's all it is.

38:00.169 --> 38:04.037
Before the great growth
of population

38:04.073 --> 38:06.633
which occurred
with the advent of oil

38:06.676 --> 38:09.907
came this revolution in
the monetary system as well.

38:09.946 --> 38:11.641
There was a time
when the pound sterling

38:11.681 --> 38:15.048
actually meant
a pound of sterling silver.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.052
There was only so much silver
out of the ground.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.086
It was tangible.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.383
You couldn't print silver.

38:19.422 --> 38:23.119
It was something real.

38:23.159 --> 38:25.389
You cannot print any more money

38:25.428 --> 38:28.556
than there is energy
to back it up.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.589
That simple.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.536
So we have fiat currency.

38:35.571 --> 38:38.563
Then we have something called
fractional reserve banking.

38:41.277 --> 38:45.111
If you were to bring me
a $10 deposit,

38:45.148 --> 38:48.845
I could make $90 worth of loans

38:48.885 --> 38:51.217
based on just having
that $10 in my drawer,

38:51.254 --> 38:53.484
because it's all calculated
on the premise

38:53.523 --> 38:54.956
that not everybody's
gonna come in

38:54.991 --> 38:56.151
and want their cash all at once.

38:56.192 --> 38:58.217
That's called a run on the bank.

38:58.261 --> 39:00.354
So they have calculated
the odds,

39:00.396 --> 39:04.127
much as Vegas odds makers do,
and said,

39:04.167 --> 39:06.635
"Okay, well, you know,
there are very little odds

39:06.669 --> 39:09.365
under normal conditions."

39:09.405 --> 39:16.140
When I lend now a total of $100
based on that $10 deposit,

39:16.179 --> 39:20.377
that's more money
that I create out of thin air.

39:20.416 --> 39:23.112
Well, gee, that means
that in order to pay off,

39:23.152 --> 39:26.280
whoever gets that money
has to make more money still

39:26.322 --> 39:28.222
to feed in at the bottom
to pay the bank

39:28.257 --> 39:31.283
so that the bank
can create still more money.

39:35.064 --> 39:36.691
You know, I think it's probably
pretty safe

39:36.733 --> 39:39.133
at this point in time with the
collapse of the U.S. economy

39:39.168 --> 39:41.636
to say that pretty much
everybody is understanding

39:41.671 --> 39:43.764
how compound interest works.

39:43.806 --> 39:46.570
The higher the interest rate
on your credit card,

39:46.609 --> 39:50.306
for those people who had 20%,
25% cards,

39:50.346 --> 39:52.712
that means they are creating
that much more money

39:52.749 --> 39:56.617
if they don't pay cash
every month.

39:56.652 --> 40:01.555
What I have just described
is a pyramid scheme.

40:01.591 --> 40:04.754
We live in
an infinite-growth paradigm

40:04.794 --> 40:06.591
which requires growth forever.

40:06.629 --> 40:09.530
It's not that Bernie Madoff
was a pyramid scheme

40:09.565 --> 40:12.591
or Stanford was
a pyramid scheme.

40:12.635 --> 40:15.001
The whole economy
is a pyramid scheme.

40:15.037 --> 40:18.006
The whole global economy
cannot be sustained.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.668
It requires infinite growth.

40:20.710 --> 40:24.703
But infinite growth collides
with finite energy.

40:24.747 --> 40:26.214
First law of thermodynamics,

40:26.249 --> 40:28.649
energy can neither be created
nor destroyed.

40:28.684 --> 40:29.844
The second law:

40:29.886 --> 40:32.047
energy converts
in only one direction:

40:32.088 --> 40:34.283
from usable to unusable.

40:34.323 --> 40:35.688
That's called
the law of entropy.

40:35.725 --> 40:36.851
Things break down.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.361
And in every energy transaction,

40:39.395 --> 40:42.023
some energy is always lost.

40:42.064 --> 40:43.531
So you have finite energy

40:43.566 --> 40:45.534
and you have
a financial paradigm

40:45.568 --> 40:47.195
which demands infinite growth,

40:47.236 --> 40:49.363
and we are at the point
of human history

40:49.405 --> 40:52.135
where the infinite growth
paradigm collides with something

40:52.175 --> 40:54.370
that is more powerful
than money is.

41:04.987 --> 41:10.653
By 2006, I knew that
the collapse was very imminent,

41:10.693 --> 41:13.127
that there would be a major
implosion of the U.S. economy.

41:13.162 --> 41:15.357
I actually missed it
by about a year,

41:15.398 --> 41:16.398
maybe a little bit more.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.872
I thought it was
gonna happen sooner,

41:17.900 --> 41:19.663
but it happened.

41:19.702 --> 41:21.636
And now that it is happening,

41:21.671 --> 41:23.434
these pieces are falling exactly

41:23.473 --> 41:26.533
as if everything else
we had written, said, done...

41:26.576 --> 41:27.702
all the peak oil activists,

41:27.743 --> 41:32.237
all the sustainability
advocates...

41:32.281 --> 41:34.579
our map was proving
deadly accurate.

41:42.925 --> 41:47.862
Things don't break up;
they break down.

41:47.897 --> 41:51.856
When a government collapses,
what happens?

41:51.901 --> 41:53.334
Mail stops getting delivered.

41:53.369 --> 41:55.599
Air traffic controllers
don't get paid,

41:55.638 --> 41:57.003
so they don't go to work,

41:57.039 --> 41:59.371
which means planes don't fly.

41:59.408 --> 42:02.468
Bridges and highway inspections
don't get made.

42:02.512 --> 42:06.141
Food and Drug Administration
inspections don't get made.

42:06.182 --> 42:08.446
Maintenance is going
to be defrayed.

42:08.484 --> 42:11.612
Law enforcement stops working.

42:11.654 --> 42:12.848
I mean, it's no secret now.

42:12.889 --> 42:14.117
You see the headlines every day.

42:14.156 --> 42:17.785
California is bankrupt,
Michigan is bankrupt, Ohio.

42:17.827 --> 42:21.661
They're shutting down services
left and right.

42:21.697 --> 42:24.029
There are tent cities springing
up all over the country.

42:24.066 --> 42:26.296
There are homeless
displaced people.

42:26.335 --> 42:30.738
A great many billionaires,
who we would call the elites,

42:30.773 --> 42:34.402
a great many very, very wealthy
people are getting crashed,

42:34.443 --> 42:37.037
burned, and eaten alive.

42:37.079 --> 42:40.571
What you don't hear is the fact
that, all over the world,

42:40.616 --> 42:44.677
economies are collapsing much
faster than the U.S. economy.

42:47.056 --> 42:50.753
Britain is an absolute
basket case.

42:50.793 --> 42:55.253
There is a curtain of despair
descending

42:55.298 --> 42:59.860
across Eastern Europe.

42:59.902 --> 43:01.767
There's a revolution under way
in Greece.

43:01.804 --> 43:03.101
It's not riots.

43:03.139 --> 43:06.734
It's not civil unrest;
it's a revolution.

43:06.776 --> 43:08.869
Drug violence right across
the border in Mexico,

43:08.911 --> 43:10.242
this is all part
of the collapse.

43:10.279 --> 43:14.113
Pakistan, Afghanistan,
there's lots of violence.

43:14.150 --> 43:17.051
The people who have run
the planet to this point

43:17.086 --> 43:20.783
and who are running the planet
now are losing control.

43:28.798 --> 43:30.766
Have I ever been called
a conspiracy theorist?

43:30.800 --> 43:35.237
Of course I've been called
a conspiracy theorist.

43:35.271 --> 43:36.829
But I don't deal
in conspiracy theory.

43:36.872 --> 43:39.238
I deal in conspiracy fact.

43:48.317 --> 43:50.478
Somebody once said to me
a long time ago,

43:50.519 --> 43:53.488
and this was probably
back in '84,

43:53.522 --> 43:57.652
"Climb down off the cross,
asshole, we need the lumber!"

43:57.693 --> 43:59.388
I am not a Messiah.

43:59.428 --> 44:02.056
I am not responsible
for saving anybody.

44:02.098 --> 44:06.432
The only person I am
responsible for saving is me.

44:07.870 --> 44:10.737
What I see now is the end
of a paradigm

44:10.773 --> 44:13.640
that is as cataclysmic
as the asteroid event

44:13.676 --> 44:16.543
that killed almost all the life
on the Earth

44:16.579 --> 44:18.274
and certainly the dinosaurs.

44:18.314 --> 44:22.216
Now, the dinosaurs were
kings of their paradigm,

44:22.251 --> 44:24.219
and a paradigm is
what you think about something

44:24.253 --> 44:25.686
before you think about it.

44:25.721 --> 44:27.586
Somebody talks about money,

44:27.623 --> 44:30.888
and you automatically accept
without thinking

44:30.926 --> 44:33.986
that compound interest,
factional reserve banking,

44:34.030 --> 44:35.292
and fiat currency is okay,

44:35.331 --> 44:36.389
and we have to protect that,

44:36.432 --> 44:37.865
because if we don't
protect that,

44:37.900 --> 44:41.996
it's gonna be bad for us.

44:42.038 --> 44:44.165
If you know anything
about Darwinism,

44:44.206 --> 44:45.639
basically what it said was

44:45.675 --> 44:48.667
is that those species
that had evolved

44:48.711 --> 44:52.841
or were able to adapt
to changing circumstances

44:52.882 --> 44:54.179
were the ones that survived,

44:54.216 --> 44:55.649
and those that were not equipped

44:55.685 --> 44:58.916
or had been...
become evolutionary dead ends

44:58.954 --> 45:01.616
were destined to die.

45:01.657 --> 45:03.124
"Mike, you better be careful.

45:03.159 --> 45:06.959
It sounds like you're advocating
Social Darwinism."

45:06.996 --> 45:09.521
I'm not advocating
Social Darwinism.

45:09.565 --> 45:12.295
I am witnessing
actual Darwinism.

45:15.104 --> 45:19.200
If you are in a camp
with a bunch of campers

45:19.241 --> 45:21.709
and a bear attacks,

45:21.744 --> 45:24.679
you don't have to be faster
than the bear.

45:24.714 --> 45:27.649
You only have to be faster
than the slowest camper.

45:32.555 --> 45:39.484
There is one and only one
graph image

45:39.528 --> 45:41.962
that I have used

45:41.997 --> 45:47.697
in I would guess 60 to 70
lectures in eight countries,

45:47.737 --> 45:50.205
and that's a graph
of human population,

45:50.239 --> 45:53.800
and if one looks at that graph,

45:53.843 --> 45:56.641
what you see is human population

45:56.679 --> 46:01.673
roughly stable at around
a billion people or so

46:01.717 --> 46:03.878
with maybe a little bit more
at around the time of Christ.

46:03.919 --> 46:07.821
Then it stays pretty stable
until we get to the bubonic...

46:07.857 --> 46:11.293
it starts to rise some as some
primitive technology emerged,

46:11.327 --> 46:12.847
but then you get
to the Bubonic plague.

46:12.862 --> 46:14.454
There's a little dip.

46:14.497 --> 46:15.896
Then after the bubonic plague,

46:15.931 --> 46:19.833
you begin the start of what
we would call the Renaissance

46:19.869 --> 46:23.168
and the early stages
of the Industrial Revolution,

46:23.205 --> 46:25.696
the discovery of steam.

46:25.741 --> 46:29.040
The population starts
to go like this.

46:29.078 --> 46:30.170
The introduction of coal,

46:30.212 --> 46:32.237
the population
starts to go like this.

46:32.281 --> 46:36.081
But around 1900, around the turn
of the 20th century,

46:36.118 --> 46:39.281
what you see as oil
became ubiquitous

46:39.321 --> 46:42.848
was that the population
went like this,

46:42.892 --> 46:46.089
and it goes up
to 6.5 billion people.

46:46.128 --> 46:48.187
We may be at 7 billion people

46:48.230 --> 46:52.030
by the time anyone
sees this interview.

46:52.067 --> 46:56.902
All of those people exist on
this planet only because of oil.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.270
That's it.

46:58.307 --> 47:01.140
So it's axiomatic
that if you take the oil away,

47:01.177 --> 47:03.372
the population
must go away also.

47:03.412 --> 47:06.609
In all of science,
in all of biology,

47:06.649 --> 47:09.413
there is no case
where any population,

47:09.451 --> 47:13.581
be it bacteria in a petri dish
or caribou in an Arctic island,

47:13.622 --> 47:16.420
runs into a set
of favorable circumstances

47:16.458 --> 47:21.395
and goes to that point
without an immediate crash down.

47:21.430 --> 47:22.556
It's a law.

47:22.598 --> 47:24.038
It's a law
as fundamental as gravity.

47:24.066 --> 47:26.591
It's a law as fundamental
as thermodynamics,

47:26.635 --> 47:27.897
and if one thinks about it,

47:27.937 --> 47:30.838
it might also be viewed
as true of the stock market

47:30.873 --> 47:31.897
or the financial markets,

47:31.941 --> 47:32.941
which go like this,

47:32.975 --> 47:34.067
and when they go like this,

47:34.109 --> 47:35.474
they automatically go like this.

47:35.511 --> 47:37.240
That's the history
of every bubble.

47:48.524 --> 47:54.952
I think it's a mistake
to ask, "If people,"

47:54.997 --> 48:01.732
and make all people
the same as one entity,

48:01.770 --> 48:04.204
if they will understand it.

48:04.240 --> 48:09.769
I don't care
if all people understand it.

48:09.812 --> 48:12.303
When you're faced
with an overwhelming,

48:12.348 --> 48:13.838
life-threatening crisis,

48:13.883 --> 48:17.410
as in the Titanic being hit
by an iceberg,

48:17.453 --> 48:20.149
and you happen to be aware
before anybody else is

48:20.189 --> 48:21.315
that the ship is gonna sink

48:21.357 --> 48:23.655
and there aren't
enough lifeboats

48:23.692 --> 48:25.819
and you know
how to build lifeboats

48:25.861 --> 48:27.795
and you tried to deal with that

48:27.830 --> 48:31.493
in however long the Titanic
had before it went down,

48:31.533 --> 48:35.196
you're likely to run across
three types of passenger

48:35.237 --> 48:36.465
on the Titanic.

48:36.505 --> 48:38.439
You'll run across a type

48:38.474 --> 48:41.170
that's basically
deer in the headlights.

48:41.210 --> 48:42.802
"Ship's been hit?
What does that mean?

48:42.845 --> 48:44.244
"What do I do?
I don't know what to do.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.269
"I don't where to go.
Should I do that?

48:45.314 --> 48:46.314
I don't know."

48:46.348 --> 48:47.348
That's one group.

48:47.383 --> 48:50.648
There's another group that says,

48:50.686 --> 48:52.313
"We get that the ship
is gonna sink.

48:52.354 --> 48:54.515
"We get that we're all gonna die

48:54.556 --> 48:56.421
"unless we make some lifeboats
and do it fast.

48:56.458 --> 48:58.323
Show us what to do."

48:58.360 --> 48:59.952
Then you have a third group
that says,

48:59.995 --> 49:01.019
"This is the Titanic.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.588
"It's absolutely unsinkable.

49:03.632 --> 49:05.964
"Un-fucking-sinkable.

49:06.001 --> 49:07.798
"So we're going back to the bar
for a drink,

49:07.836 --> 49:10.828
and all you doomsday sayers
can actually just take a hike."

49:10.873 --> 49:13.000
Now, if you're the one who knows
how to build lifeboats,

49:13.042 --> 49:15.272
which group of people
are you gonna help?

49:19.281 --> 49:21.909
Certain things
are inevitable right now.

49:21.951 --> 49:25.216
FDIC insolvency,
I will tell you, is coming.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.950
Insolvency of
the Federal Reserve is coming.

49:27.990 --> 49:30.151
Federal Reserve can go bankrupt.

49:30.192 --> 49:32.353
T-bill defaults.

49:32.394 --> 49:35.386
We're looking
at major bankruptcy,

49:35.431 --> 49:37.092
starvation, dislocation.

49:37.132 --> 49:39.999
All these things
are already on the way.

49:43.839 --> 49:45.136
Everything is gonna break down

49:45.174 --> 49:47.768
differently in different places.

49:47.810 --> 49:49.903
The best that I can do
is give you some ideas

49:49.945 --> 49:54.109
of some markers
that are gonna come.

49:54.149 --> 49:57.812
The bumpy plateau has been
described by peak oil activists

49:57.853 --> 49:59.684
and researchers
for many, many years,

49:59.722 --> 50:02.020
and it's actually happening.

50:02.057 --> 50:07.518
Basically you come up
the growth curve of oil prices,

50:07.563 --> 50:11.556
and the oil prices go up until
you start running out of oil.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.364
Then what happens is,
you have to destroy demand,

50:14.403 --> 50:16.234
which is what's happening
with this collapse.

50:16.271 --> 50:18.967
Demand gets destroyed;
the price of oil drops.

50:19.008 --> 50:21.568
But as you start a recovery
you start back up again,

50:21.610 --> 50:25.068
and you collide again
with the finite oil

50:25.114 --> 50:26.638
and the rising energy prices,

50:26.682 --> 50:28.081
which shuts
everything down again.

50:28.117 --> 50:30.950
This is the bumpy plateau.

50:30.986 --> 50:33.819
I think it's fairly certain

50:33.856 --> 50:38.122
that the mortal blow to human
industrialized civilization

50:38.160 --> 50:41.323
will happen
when oil prices spike again

50:41.363 --> 50:43.763
and nobody can afford
to buy that oil,

50:43.799 --> 50:46.233
and everything
will just shut down.

50:50.172 --> 50:53.403
The collapse must happen fast

50:53.442 --> 50:56.809
in order to leave
infrastructure standing.

50:56.845 --> 50:59.245
We have all heard the stories
about infrastructure, you know,

50:59.281 --> 51:02.614
the sewers and the bridges
and the roads and all that.

51:02.651 --> 51:03.982
Well, the point is,

51:04.019 --> 51:08.479
is that as economic collapse
continues or accelerates,

51:08.524 --> 51:13.894
those structures will fall
into more and more disrepair.

51:13.929 --> 51:15.294
There's not gonna be any money

51:15.330 --> 51:17.093
or anything running
to fix those,

51:17.132 --> 51:21.592
so what you want to have
is the change to a new paradigm,

51:21.637 --> 51:23.468
getting the old one
out of the way

51:23.505 --> 51:25.837
while there is still
infrastructure left

51:25.874 --> 51:28.399
to start building something new.

51:31.580 --> 51:34.413
We have to survive
the transition phase

51:34.450 --> 51:35.849
of human civilization,

51:35.884 --> 51:40.116
which I anticipate could last
anywhere between 20 years...

51:40.155 --> 51:45.092
and oh, my God,
would that be fast and hard...

51:45.127 --> 51:46.958
you know, to 50 years
or 100 years

51:46.995 --> 51:51.694
before some kind of stable
civilization starts to emerge.

51:51.733 --> 51:53.598
You need to survive
the transition phase.

51:53.635 --> 51:54.932
So don't panic.

51:54.970 --> 51:56.699
Don't freak out.

51:56.738 --> 51:58.569
Use your heads.

51:58.607 --> 52:02.270
Analyze your local situation
where you live,

52:02.311 --> 52:04.279
don't worry about
rebuilding sewers.

52:04.313 --> 52:07.009
You're gonna be able
to get water for a few years.

52:09.084 --> 52:12.383
People say there's either oil
or no oil.

52:12.421 --> 52:14.912
There's either food or no food.

52:14.957 --> 52:16.447
And people say,

52:16.492 --> 52:18.858
"Well, we're gonna have food
in the supermarkets on Tuesday,

52:18.894 --> 52:20.294
and we're never gonna
see it again."

52:20.329 --> 52:21.769
That's not the way
it's gonna happen.

52:21.797 --> 52:25.961
As things break down,
we will see specific shortages

52:26.001 --> 52:29.061
in specific areas
for periods of days

52:29.104 --> 52:32.665
before it gets to the point
where there's nothing left.

52:32.708 --> 52:35.302
So what you need to prepare for
is not the end result,

52:35.344 --> 52:37.710
but you need to prepare
to survive the transition.

52:40.649 --> 52:42.640
When people say, "Okay,
I'm gonna run for the hills.

52:42.684 --> 52:43.878
"I'm gonna go build a cabin.

52:43.919 --> 52:46.217
I'm gonna buy ten million cans
of baked beans."

52:46.255 --> 52:48.175
Well, they're probably gonna be
the first to die.

52:48.190 --> 52:50.124
Number one, it's too late.

52:50.159 --> 52:51.717
If you don't know
how to live off the land,

52:51.760 --> 52:54.024
and if you're not already
on the land right now,

52:54.062 --> 52:55.256
don't even try to go,

52:55.297 --> 52:57.561
because you're gonna
fail miserably,

52:57.599 --> 52:59.089
and you might be shot
by the people

52:59.134 --> 53:00.761
who got there ahead of you.

53:05.374 --> 53:06.671
<i>You know, the one factor</i>

53:06.708 --> 53:08.308
<i>that you're not including
in some of this</i>

53:08.310 --> 53:11.438
<i>is just sort of discounting
human ingenuity,</i>

53:11.480 --> 53:16.110
<i>or our ability
to sort of problem solve.</i>

53:16.151 --> 53:21.987
Because my father was an Air
Force aviator combat veteran,

53:22.024 --> 53:25.551
he was very much trained
in a military style

53:25.594 --> 53:27.186
of decision making and analysis

53:27.229 --> 53:30.357
where it's motivated
by life-and-death decisions,

53:30.399 --> 53:32.890
where you are trained
how to think critically

53:32.935 --> 53:35.426
and respond critically
in response to emergency.

53:35.470 --> 53:38.268
So I was trained at an early age

53:38.307 --> 53:41.071
in the skill
of critical thinking,

53:41.109 --> 53:42.469
and maybe I have a gift
for it too.

53:42.477 --> 53:43.808
I believe there are some people

53:43.845 --> 53:46.143
who have a gift
for critical thinking.

53:46.181 --> 53:47.944
In my own experience
on the streets

53:47.983 --> 53:50.417
in South Central Los Angeles
as a cop,

53:50.452 --> 53:51.976
there were quick decisions,

53:52.020 --> 53:57.822
sometimes decisions
which changed people's lives

53:57.859 --> 53:59.759
or could end people's lives,

53:59.795 --> 54:03.390
and it gave me an ability
to respond and think

54:03.432 --> 54:05.866
to separate the ice cream
from the bullshit.

54:05.901 --> 54:08.529
Probably one of
the biggest impediments

54:08.570 --> 54:10.470
I removed
to critical thinking was,

54:10.505 --> 54:13.804
I stopped taking mainstream
media seriously a long time ago.

54:17.679 --> 54:20.273
<i>We were talking about
human ingenuity.</i>

54:26.021 --> 54:29.286
No amount of technology
and no amount of human ingenuity

54:29.324 --> 54:31.849
can possibly overturn
the laws of physics,

54:31.893 --> 54:34.885
the laws which govern
this planet.

54:34.930 --> 54:38.229
Those are intractable,
immutable, real,

54:38.267 --> 54:40.098
and science has never
been able to do that.

54:40.135 --> 54:42.831
Man's great arrogance,
I believe,

54:42.871 --> 54:44.896
and one for which
he is paying a price now

54:44.940 --> 54:47.408
is to believe that mankind
really could become God

54:47.442 --> 54:52.004
and even turn over and upset
and revoke somehow

54:52.047 --> 54:53.446
the laws of the universe.

54:56.151 --> 54:59.882
I am a great advocate of buying
and owning physical gold,

54:59.921 --> 55:01.149
not paper gold.

55:01.189 --> 55:03.214
You buy gold, you own it.

55:03.258 --> 55:06.056
When hyperinflation occurs
after deflation here,

55:06.094 --> 55:08.153
and all these trillions
of dollars come back

55:08.196 --> 55:11.529
and we are wheeling wheelbarrows
of thousand dollar bills

55:11.566 --> 55:14.501
to buy a loaf of bread,

55:14.536 --> 55:16.834
the only thing people
will accept for goods

55:16.872 --> 55:18.806
is gonna be gold.

55:18.840 --> 55:19.966
Do whatever you can

55:20.008 --> 55:22.238
to reinsulate your house
if you need to.

55:22.277 --> 55:24.609
If you have a house,
if you have soil,

55:24.646 --> 55:26.944
you immediately
get it off petrochemicals

55:26.982 --> 55:29.212
and start learning
how to restore it.

55:29.251 --> 55:32.015
What I do in the yard
where I am renting,

55:32.054 --> 55:33.919
I'm mixing barbeque and wood ash

55:33.955 --> 55:35.650
and then I go out
and pee on everything,

55:35.691 --> 55:37.181
because then you get
the root elements

55:37.225 --> 55:41.093
of ammonium-nitrate that
starts to bring the soil back.

55:41.129 --> 55:45.566
If you are dependent upon
a cell phone, get a land line.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.591
All the
telecommunications companies

55:47.636 --> 55:49.627
that operate the satellites,
the cell towers,

55:49.671 --> 55:51.104
the fiber optic cables,

55:51.139 --> 55:53.801
and all this stuff that makes
your wonderful cell phone work

55:53.842 --> 55:56.902
are cutting back on maintenance
as the stock market collapses,

55:56.945 --> 56:00.278
and we're gonna see failures
in cell phone service.

56:00.315 --> 56:04.775
A land line is a redundancy
that can help you.

56:04.820 --> 56:09.154
Get books on first aid
and holistic medicine.

56:09.191 --> 56:11.421
Moderate fresh water supply,

56:11.460 --> 56:13.826
a reasonable amount
of food storage.

56:13.862 --> 56:15.523
You can't store enough
to live on.

56:15.564 --> 56:18.124
What you need to store is seeds.

56:18.166 --> 56:20.726
Seeds that are not manufactured
by Monsanto,

56:20.769 --> 56:22.100
that are not Frankenseeds,

56:22.137 --> 56:24.662
that only work one time
you plant them

56:24.706 --> 56:26.333
and then you got to go buy more.

56:26.375 --> 56:29.208
You get good organic
whole seeds,

56:29.244 --> 56:30.905
and you store them.

56:30.946 --> 56:34.438
That could be a great
currency in the future.

56:42.524 --> 56:44.014
Unlike the Great Depression,

56:44.059 --> 56:45.959
this is a vastly
different scenario.

56:45.994 --> 56:48.588
We do not have infinite
resources left to be tapped.

56:48.630 --> 56:52.464
We don't have lots of land,
we are at peak everything,

56:52.501 --> 56:55.436
all the commodities,
everything else.

56:55.470 --> 57:00.305
What they had in the 1930s that
my grandparents told me about

57:00.342 --> 57:03.038
was the ability to grow food
right where they live,

57:03.078 --> 57:05.410
and local food production
is perhaps

57:05.447 --> 57:08.280
the most fundamental key
to human survival

57:08.316 --> 57:11.444
in the collapse
of industrialized civilization.

57:20.028 --> 57:23.293
We've had examples of what
happens when oil disappears

57:23.331 --> 57:24.958
and how civilizations respond

57:25.000 --> 57:26.524
and what works and what doesn't.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.435
In 1991,
the Soviet Union collapsed,

57:29.471 --> 57:31.996
and there were two nations
that were absolutely

57:32.040 --> 57:34.736
and totally dependent upon
Soviet oil for their survival

57:34.776 --> 57:36.141
because they had none:

57:36.178 --> 57:38.772
Cuba and North Korea.

57:38.814 --> 57:42.477
And what they did in response
to that was completely opposite,

57:42.517 --> 57:44.985
and the proof, as the say,
was in the pudding.

57:48.723 --> 57:53.092
North Korea was a rigid,
hierarchical, top-down,

57:53.128 --> 57:56.962
Soviet-style,
bureaucratic regime

57:56.998 --> 57:59.023
where everything came
from the central government.

57:59.067 --> 58:03.094
They managed everything,
and North Korea starved.

58:03.138 --> 58:08.599
I mean, it was... in human terms,
the suffering was amazing.

58:08.643 --> 58:10.008
All of a sudden, there's no oil.

58:10.045 --> 58:11.069
There's no natural gas.

58:11.112 --> 58:12.112
There's no fertilizer.

58:12.147 --> 58:13.147
Cars don't run.

58:13.181 --> 58:14.409
Trains don't run.

58:14.449 --> 58:16.649
You get to a point where
you can run trains on some days

58:16.685 --> 58:18.312
or generate electricity
on others,

58:18.353 --> 58:20.116
but you can't do both
at the same time.

58:24.593 --> 58:26.720
But the Cuban government
reverted

58:26.761 --> 58:28.752
to one of the purest forms
of capitalism.

58:28.797 --> 58:32.563
It said, "Everybody start
restoring the soil

58:32.601 --> 58:33.601
"and grow food.

58:33.635 --> 58:35.535
"You will grow food
where you live.

58:35.570 --> 58:37.663
"If you find any piece
of arable land

58:37.706 --> 58:39.674
"that is not being used,
you occupy it,

58:39.708 --> 58:40.766
"and you start farming it,

58:40.809 --> 58:43.175
and you start growing food
right now."

58:43.211 --> 58:45.008
The Cuban government
did everything it could

58:45.046 --> 58:48.174
to liberate local food growing,

58:48.216 --> 58:49.216
and what happened was,

58:49.251 --> 58:51.412
is after a very tough period,

58:51.453 --> 58:55.913
the Cuban people were eating
better than they had ever eaten,

58:55.957 --> 58:59.154
because they were free of
this whole agri-biz, you know,

58:59.194 --> 59:00.786
Frankenfood nightmare.

59:00.829 --> 59:02.319
Everything was organic,

59:02.364 --> 59:05.527
and you had every square inch
in Havana that had soil,

59:05.567 --> 59:10.800
on rooftops or in flower boxes,
was growing food,

59:10.839 --> 59:12.670
and there was a degree
of sustainability.

59:12.707 --> 59:14.334
Everything became organic,

59:14.376 --> 59:17.345
and all you had to do
was separate the people

59:17.379 --> 59:20.371
from the way money worked
and top-down control,

59:20.415 --> 59:22.349
explain to them,
you grow it where you eat it,

59:22.384 --> 59:23.384
and you're gonna make it,

59:23.418 --> 59:25.147
and Cuba survived and thrived.

59:29.391 --> 59:32.485
And that's the essence
of where everything is going to

59:32.527 --> 59:34.495
in the new human paradigm.

59:34.529 --> 59:36.520
Everything will be local.

59:42.871 --> 59:45.362
Jack London was one
of my favorite writers,

59:45.407 --> 59:48.467
and he wrote about animals
a lot.

59:48.510 --> 59:50.068
One thing you know about animals

59:50.111 --> 59:51.510
is that they all want to go home

59:51.546 --> 59:53.309
when they know that
they're gonna face death.

59:53.348 --> 59:55.407
They all want to be
in their tribe

59:55.450 --> 59:58.078
or their pack or whatever it is.

59:58.119 --> 59:59.586
They want to be
on familiar ground.

59:59.621 --> 01:00:02.920
It's a natural animal instinct.

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:06.587
In Dubai, the economic crash
has hit so hard

01:00:06.628 --> 01:00:09.791
that Indians who were living
and working in Dubai

01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:11.230
lost their jobs,

01:00:11.266 --> 01:00:13.496
and they just drove
to the Dubai airport

01:00:13.535 --> 01:00:15.230
and abandoned their cars.

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:17.898
There was a story talking about
all the cars that were abandoned

01:00:17.939 --> 01:00:21.841
as these Indians caught a
one-way ticket home to go home.

01:00:21.876 --> 01:00:23.844
It's happening in Britain too.

01:00:23.878 --> 01:00:26.745
You have lots of Poles
and Eastern Europeans,

01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:28.612
who were the latecomers
into E.U.,

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:30.675
fleeing Britain to go home.

01:00:30.719 --> 01:00:33.688
Now in some areas, and certainly
in the southern California basin

01:00:33.722 --> 01:00:37.385
with 13, 14 million people
and a four-day food supply,

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:40.451
it's clear that people are going
to migrate out of this area,

01:00:40.495 --> 01:00:41.928
because it's not sustainable.

01:00:41.963 --> 01:00:44.591
We get most of our water
from Northern California.

01:00:44.633 --> 01:00:47.727
That's a problem.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:50.329
We get a lot of our electricity
from Hoover Dam

01:00:50.372 --> 01:00:51.566
out in Las Vegas.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.039
Hmm.

01:00:53.074 --> 01:00:56.510
Phoenix, for God's sake,
Las Vegas,

01:00:56.544 --> 01:00:58.910
those people have to
worry about where to go,

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:05.682
and community
is what will save us.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.585
You are gonna have to do it
in conjunction

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:09.214
with your neighbors
and your family

01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:11.782
and the people around you.

01:01:11.826 --> 01:01:13.589
You will fail
as a rugged individual.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:16.461
You will survive as a member
of a tribe or a family.

01:01:20.368 --> 01:01:21.665
I have emotion about this.

01:01:21.703 --> 01:01:24.604
I'm losing it.

01:01:42.924 --> 01:01:46.451
We have waited...

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:51.261
have waited for so long
for somebody to listen to us.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:58.771
When the mainstream press
and the government says

01:01:58.807 --> 01:02:00.274
nobody could have
predicted this,

01:02:00.308 --> 01:02:04.938
they're lying through
their fucking teeth.

01:02:04.979 --> 01:02:07.948
We all saw exactly
what was gonna happen

01:02:07.982 --> 01:02:09.574
and how it was gonna happen

01:02:09.617 --> 01:02:12.347
and, remarkably,
when it was gonna happen.

01:02:12.387 --> 01:02:14.014
None of us expected the collapse

01:02:14.055 --> 01:02:15.955
to be as severe
as it's proving to be

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:18.458
or as fast
as it's proving to be.

01:02:18.493 --> 01:02:20.017
But we've been screaming
for years,

01:02:20.061 --> 01:02:21.756
and we've been watching
everything we said

01:02:21.796 --> 01:02:22.796
come to pass,

01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:28.633
and we have felt so angry.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:46.611
I haven't lost
emotional connection to it.

01:02:46.654 --> 01:02:49.919
What I have learned to do
over the course of my life

01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:54.088
is to balance the...

01:02:54.129 --> 01:02:58.225
the horror with love,

01:02:58.266 --> 01:03:02.794
with play,
with making people smile.

01:03:02.837 --> 01:03:04.600
I take my dog out for a walk,

01:03:04.639 --> 01:03:08.268
and we count how many smiles
we can inflict

01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:09.401
in the course of one walk.

01:03:09.444 --> 01:03:10.877
I walk through downtown
Culver City,

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:13.710
and, you know, I usually
come home, you know, and say,

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:16.876
"That was 23 smiles
we created today."

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.852
And for some reason
at this moment in time,

01:03:18.887 --> 01:03:20.855
that's a very precious
little treat for me.

01:03:26.528 --> 01:03:30.259
There was a psychologist...
psychiatrist,

01:03:30.298 --> 01:03:32.232
Elizabeth Kübler Ross,

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:35.236
who talked about
the five stages of grief,

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.270
and when you're hit with

01:03:36.304 --> 01:03:39.603
an overwhelming
life-changing situation.

01:03:39.641 --> 01:03:41.074
The first is denial.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:42.508
"This can't possibly
be happening.

01:03:42.544 --> 01:03:46.002
It's not true;
no, it's not happening."

01:03:46.047 --> 01:03:48.709
And you stay in denial,
and you fight to stay in denial.

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.980
Then comes anger.

01:03:51.019 --> 01:03:57.185
I really believe that mankind
is now entering just barely...

01:03:57.225 --> 01:04:01.321
it has just barely crossed the
threshold of the anger phase.

01:04:15.276 --> 01:04:17.107
We have to get through
the anger phase.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.340
And how we get through
that anger phase

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.405
is going to be critical.

01:04:21.449 --> 01:04:25.112
The way we're going
under current government

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.519
and monetary rule,

01:04:27.555 --> 01:04:29.819
the only kind of anger
that's going to be produced

01:04:29.858 --> 01:04:32.156
is the destructive kind,

01:04:32.193 --> 01:04:35.822
borne of absolute frustration
and bitterness

01:04:35.864 --> 01:04:37.832
that nothing
that's being sold to us

01:04:37.866 --> 01:04:38.958
as being a solution

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.629
is making us feel
any goddamn better.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.069
Then, of course, after that,

01:04:44.105 --> 01:04:45.402
you know,
we have the bargaining.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.534
Well, the bargaining
is kind of going on now too.

01:04:48.576 --> 01:04:50.476
"Maybe I could've
done something different.

01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:52.138
"Maybe I should have
thought of this.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.240
Maybe if I do this now,
it won't be different."

01:04:55.283 --> 01:04:57.114
Then you go through
the bargaining,

01:04:57.151 --> 01:04:59.176
and you finally get to a place
of depression,

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.710
where it's really starting
to sink in,

01:05:00.755 --> 01:05:02.347
and these are all
emotional stages

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.414
that one goes through

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:04.618
whether they're an individual

01:05:04.659 --> 01:05:07.184
or a culture or a civilization.

01:05:07.228 --> 01:05:09.822
And the final stage
is acceptance,

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.297
and it's really only when people

01:05:11.332 --> 01:05:13.732
have reached
the point of acceptance

01:05:13.768 --> 01:05:15.759
that you can find those people
who are like

01:05:15.803 --> 01:05:17.703
part of the ones
on the Titanic saying,

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:19.934
"Okay, show us
how to build a lifeboat."

01:05:23.912 --> 01:05:26.142
<i>You know, there's different
ways to look at...</i>

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.909
<i>you can find stories
that support arguments</i>

01:05:27.949 --> 01:05:29.280
<i>that you want to make,</i>

01:05:29.317 --> 01:05:31.182
<i>just because there's
different authors</i>

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:33.084
<i>that sort of support
your world view,</i>

01:05:33.121 --> 01:05:34.486
<i>and there's other ones
that don't.</i>

01:05:34.522 --> 01:05:37.821
<i>Is it possible to sort
of create a reality</i>

01:05:37.859 --> 01:05:41.226
<i>based on picking news stories
that support your world view?</i>

01:05:48.603 --> 01:05:51.231
I don't do debates anymore,

01:05:51.272 --> 01:05:53.172
and the reason why
I don't do debates anymore

01:05:53.207 --> 01:05:56.404
is because I don't have to.

01:05:56.444 --> 01:05:58.605
At some point, you have
to acknowledge the fact

01:05:58.646 --> 01:06:00.307
that what I've been
writing about

01:06:00.348 --> 01:06:01.542
and what I've been saying

01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:04.016
is actually happening
all around us.

01:06:04.052 --> 01:06:07.681
So why do I need
to debate anything?

01:06:07.722 --> 01:06:09.815
Why does the peak oil movement,

01:06:09.857 --> 01:06:12.257
why does
the sustainability movement,

01:06:12.293 --> 01:06:14.557
need to debate anything?

01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:16.358
Everything that we said
was gonna happen

01:06:16.397 --> 01:06:18.661
is taking place right now.

01:06:26.207 --> 01:06:31.668
Every aspect of human existence
is on the table.

01:06:31.713 --> 01:06:35.274
As far as political parties go,
they're all anachronisms.

01:06:35.316 --> 01:06:40.276
They're all products
of centuries gone by.

01:06:40.321 --> 01:06:43.188
The human race now
is only going to be concerned

01:06:43.224 --> 01:06:44.418
not with an ideology

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:46.154
but what allows them to survive.

01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:50.688
Capitalism, socialism,
and communism are all terms

01:06:50.732 --> 01:06:53.098
that need to be tossed
in the trash can immediately,

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:55.068
because all of them were created

01:06:55.103 --> 01:06:58.630
on the assumption
of infinite resources.

01:06:58.673 --> 01:07:02.165
Not one of those ideologies
that are now dead dinosaurs,

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:03.677
archaic fossils,

01:07:03.711 --> 01:07:06.111
and no longer relevant
to our way of life,

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.207
not one of them recognizes
that there must be a balance

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:14.483
between growth and the resources
and the planet.

01:07:14.522 --> 01:07:17.514
So forget the idea that you can
have as much as you want,

01:07:17.558 --> 01:07:20.925
because until mankind
surrenders to the fact

01:07:20.962 --> 01:07:22.793
that it lives on a finite planet

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:25.060
and it must have balance
with that planet,

01:07:25.099 --> 01:07:27.226
with the planet's resources,
with the animal life,

01:07:27.268 --> 01:07:28.360
and all the other life,

01:07:28.403 --> 01:07:30.803
there can be no happiness
for anything.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.703
Anything.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.607
It's all about
getting balance back.

01:07:35.643 --> 01:07:40.103
And who sold me the idea
that it was my destiny to grow?

01:07:40.148 --> 01:07:41.547
Nothing grows forever.

01:07:41.582 --> 01:07:43.345
There's no such thing
as infinite growth.

01:07:43.384 --> 01:07:44.874
It's not possible.

01:07:44.919 --> 01:07:47.319
Look around at everything you
see around you that's living.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.050
There is a cycle:

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.992
birth, growth, maturation,
decline, and death.

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:55.086
The challenge being faced
by the human race now

01:07:55.129 --> 01:07:56.289
is either evolve or perish,

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:57.558
either grow up or die.

01:07:57.598 --> 01:07:58.690
God doesn't care.

01:07:58.733 --> 01:08:00.253
God's not gonna play babysitter
for us.

01:08:00.268 --> 01:08:02.828
The challenge is either
you grow up and mature,

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.430
change your minds
and the way you think,

01:08:04.472 --> 01:08:06.337
or you're gonna perish.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:08.069
Everything is on the table now.

01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:09.337
God is on the table.

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:12.676
Every religion in the world
is on the table now.

01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:14.840
They'll all be measured
as standards by,

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.475
"This is reality, and this is
what the religion says,"

01:08:17.518 --> 01:08:18.678
and every religion in the world

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:21.243
is gonna be under
a huge microscope.

01:08:21.288 --> 01:08:23.189
This is gonna be
the greatest age of evolution

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.419
in human thinking
that's ever taken place.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:30.492
You walk towards your fear.

01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:31.759
You embrace your fear.

01:08:31.799 --> 01:08:34.290
You don't try to hedge it,

01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:36.769
that a part of real living
as a human being,

01:08:36.804 --> 01:08:38.066
as a spiritual being,

01:08:38.106 --> 01:08:41.371
is to embrace and encompass
your fear, your love,

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:43.809
and not run away from anything,

01:08:43.845 --> 01:08:46.712
because that's
the life experience,

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.475
and it's in that richness

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:50.746
that I think we find
the most beautiful art,

01:08:50.785 --> 01:08:52.218
the most beautiful music.

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:55.950
We find the richness of
what the human soul can offer,

01:08:55.990 --> 01:09:01.326
and I see all that richness
buried under such bullshit.

01:09:08.803 --> 01:09:11.169
<i>Can you talk about
your own spirituality?</i>

01:09:11.205 --> 01:09:13.366
<i>You talk about
a lot of different religions.</i>

01:09:13.407 --> 01:09:19.345
<i>How do you define
your own spirituality?</i>

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.009
I quote a Christian,
St. Timothy,

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:28.511
and I find it to be true
what he said,

01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:33.493
that the love of money
is the root of all evil.

01:09:33.528 --> 01:09:36.929
That's the end result of my
spiritual intellectual quest.

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:38.192
It is the end.

01:09:38.232 --> 01:09:40.996
It is the fundamental truth
that I have verified

01:09:41.035 --> 01:09:46.301
through three decades of
empirical, investigative, legal,

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.434
academic research,

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:51.569
trying to answer
some fundamental questions

01:09:51.612 --> 01:09:54.376
about human existence
and why we behave the way we do,

01:09:54.415 --> 01:09:55.609
why we think the way we do,

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:57.345
why we act the way we do.

01:09:57.385 --> 01:09:59.353
The love of money
is the root of all evil,

01:09:59.387 --> 01:10:00.547
and it is the love of money

01:10:00.588 --> 01:10:03.250
which has the potential
to exterminate,

01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:07.387
to render extinct
the entire human race.

01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:24.303
All right,
so here we have this...

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:27.337
this likeable,

01:10:27.381 --> 01:10:32.978
sincere guy in the White House,

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.957
and he is as imprisoned
as we all are.

01:10:37.992 --> 01:10:38.992
I need to cut.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.687
I need to cut.
I need to cut.

01:10:40.728 --> 01:10:43.993
I'm just having a real powerful
wave of emotion right now,

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:47.364
because a whole new realization
is opening to me

01:10:47.401 --> 01:10:48.925
about what I'm actually saying,

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.767
and this is some
serious fucking shit,

01:10:50.805 --> 01:10:54.263
so I got to get my head
around it for a second.

01:10:54.308 --> 01:10:56.299
Fuck.

01:10:59.247 --> 01:11:03.581
Okay, I'm ready.

01:11:03.618 --> 01:11:04.949
He is a prisoner of government.

01:11:04.986 --> 01:11:06.044
He's a prisoner of politics.

01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:07.554
He's a prisoner of economics.

01:11:07.588 --> 01:11:09.988
He's a prisoner of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.

01:11:10.024 --> 01:11:11.821
He's a prisoner
of the Federal Reserve.

01:11:11.859 --> 01:11:15.090
He's a prisoner
of a governmental system

01:11:15.129 --> 01:11:18.428
that's archaic
and not quickly responsive,

01:11:18.466 --> 01:11:23.961
so we should not make
the success or failure

01:11:24.005 --> 01:11:29.409
of human civilization
rest on his shoulders.

01:11:29.443 --> 01:11:37.443
The only thing in the world that
you and I can possibly change

01:11:37.818 --> 01:11:39.786
to give ourselves
a chance of survival

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.617
and to give our children
a chance

01:11:41.656 --> 01:11:48.459
at some kind of human
civilized life is our minds.

01:11:48.496 --> 01:11:54.162
You have to believe, not wish,
not hope, not pray, not beg.

01:11:54.201 --> 01:11:56.533
You just have to believe
that there's a way out of it,

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:58.197
and you're gonna find it.

01:11:58.239 --> 01:12:00.799
This is perhaps
the greatest part

01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:02.240
of the American character is,

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:03.368
when we get pissed off

01:12:03.411 --> 01:12:05.106
and we put our minds
to something

01:12:05.146 --> 01:12:07.046
and we clearly understand
what needs to be done

01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:08.309
and we believe in it,

01:12:08.349 --> 01:12:10.715
we really can change things.

01:12:10.751 --> 01:12:16.417
I plan on living joyfully and
happily for the rest of my life,

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.220
a free man.

01:12:18.259 --> 01:12:20.250
Shit.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.819
How can you possibly say
there's no hope?

01:12:22.863 --> 01:12:26.162
Just change your mind
and see what we see.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.929
Stop thinking like dinosaurs.

01:12:32.106 --> 01:12:34.131
<i>So do you feel that the work
that you do,</i>

01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:35.506
<i>you're just gonna do it</i>

01:12:35.543 --> 01:12:37.534
<i>regardless of what the
possible consequences are?</i>

01:12:37.578 --> 01:12:40.877
<i>It just would be so much easier
to have walked away.</i>

01:12:45.219 --> 01:12:53.219
If there was a German
in 1932, 1933,

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.622
who had the foresight
to look ahead

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:59.189
and to see what
the inevitable end result

01:12:59.233 --> 01:13:01.929
of the Third Reich would be,

01:13:01.969 --> 01:13:04.199
if there was somebody
who had seen that coming,

01:13:04.238 --> 01:13:07.366
do you honestly think that
they could in good conscience

01:13:07.408 --> 01:13:09.000
turn around
and walk away from it

01:13:09.043 --> 01:13:11.773
and pretend it wasn't there?

01:13:11.812 --> 01:13:14.975
When every passing day,

01:13:15.015 --> 01:13:16.676
from the first election
of Adolf Hitler

01:13:16.717 --> 01:13:18.548
as Chancellor in 1933,

01:13:18.586 --> 01:13:22.181
to Kristallnacht,
to the Night of the Long Knives,

01:13:22.223 --> 01:13:25.522
to Anschluss,
the occupation of Austria,

01:13:25.559 --> 01:13:27.993
to Sudetenland, Poland,

01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:30.758
as all of those things happened
that were right on the map,

01:13:30.798 --> 01:13:33.665
how do you think that person
would have felt?

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:37.831
Do you think that person
could have walked away?

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:41.535
We are all collectively
as a species responsible

01:13:41.575 --> 01:13:46.478
for what may be the greatest
preventable holocaust

01:13:46.514 --> 01:13:48.982
in the history of planet Earth.

01:13:49.016 --> 01:13:52.577
Our own suicide.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:56.249
How do you walk away from that?

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:59.054
How do you sleep at night?

01:13:59.093 --> 01:14:02.153
Who is anybody?

01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:07.530
Who are you to tell me

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:11.197
it would have been easier
to walk away?

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:12.865
You aren't in my skin.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:15.398
It was never easier for me
to walk away

01:14:15.443 --> 01:14:18.537
because to walk away
would have meant to compromise.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:22.913
To walk away would have meant
selling out.

01:14:27.721 --> 01:14:34.149
You know, I'm still a guy who,
30 years ago,

01:14:34.195 --> 01:14:36.755
approached his government
as a citizen

01:14:36.797 --> 01:14:39.357
asking for redress of grievance.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.833
I caught the CIA dealing drugs.

01:14:40.868 --> 01:14:41.994
It's wrong.

01:14:42.036 --> 01:14:43.503
Somebody needs
to talk about this,

01:14:43.537 --> 01:14:46.233
and I'm still that same guy.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:49.572
I'm still the 27-year-old
about to be promoted,

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.408
perfect record,
perfect rating report,

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:56.780
LAPD...
dedicated, clean LAPD cop.

01:14:56.817 --> 01:14:58.341
He's still alive in me,

01:14:58.385 --> 01:15:02.412
and he very much wants
some answers.

01:15:23.344 --> 01:15:30.409
There is a legend or a fable
that really speaks to my life

01:15:30.451 --> 01:15:31.782
about the 100th Monkey.

01:15:41.695 --> 01:15:44.323
A long time ago
in the late '40s, early '50s

01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:46.390
when atom bombs and H-bombs
were in vogue

01:15:46.433 --> 01:15:49.596
with above-ground testing,

01:15:49.637 --> 01:15:53.232
we set off an atom bomb
on an atoll in the Pacific,

01:15:53.274 --> 01:15:55.071
and then we waited
a number of years,

01:15:55.109 --> 01:15:57.475
because we wanted
to answer questions like,

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.775
"Gee, how soon after we
nuked something

01:15:59.813 --> 01:16:02.976
would it be possible to get
any kind of life started again?"

01:16:05.553 --> 01:16:07.043
So they went back
to this island,

01:16:07.087 --> 01:16:09.783
and they decided
to repopulate it with monkeys,

01:16:09.823 --> 01:16:12.223
and the monkeys ate coconuts.

01:16:12.259 --> 01:16:14.250
Everything was pretty healthy

01:16:14.295 --> 01:16:16.593
except for the fact that
the husks of the coconuts

01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:21.533
were slightly radioactive.

01:16:21.569 --> 01:16:25.403
So the scientists took
ten monkeys or so

01:16:25.439 --> 01:16:28.272
and taught them
to wash the coconuts

01:16:28.309 --> 01:16:31.836
in a fresh water stream
on the island

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:34.313
before they cracked them open

01:16:34.348 --> 01:16:38.284
and turned the whole thing loose
to see what would happen.

01:16:38.319 --> 01:16:39.616
Well, you know, pretty soon,

01:16:39.653 --> 01:16:42.520
maybe 12 monkeys out of
a population of 10,000

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:43.989
were washing their coconuts

01:16:44.024 --> 01:16:47.187
and then 20, and then 47.

01:16:49.296 --> 01:16:52.129
But a funny thing happened.

01:16:52.166 --> 01:16:53.861
As soon as the 100th monkey

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.528
started washing
his coconut husk,

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:58.902
all 10,000 started
washing simultaneously.

01:17:01.542 --> 01:17:04.511
I guess one way that I have
always looked at my life,

01:17:04.545 --> 01:17:06.479
especially since
I clearly understood

01:17:06.513 --> 01:17:12.611
what this issue was
in late 2001 is,

01:17:12.653 --> 01:17:15.121
this is my quest
for the 100th monkey.
