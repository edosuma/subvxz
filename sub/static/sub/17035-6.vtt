00:06.680 --> 00:08.280
 Ah, Thanksgiving...

00:08.282 --> 00:11.217
the sweet aroma of a home-cooked meal...

00:11.219 --> 00:12.351
that wasn't ours.

00:12.353 --> 00:14.520
Knock, knock! Look who's here!

00:14.522 --> 00:15.488
Hey!

00:15.490 --> 00:17.723
Can you believe it? He's back.

00:17.725 --> 00:18.890
Look at that face!

00:18.892 --> 00:20.626
Touch it. No!

00:20.628 --> 00:22.327
Touch his face with your face.

00:22.329 --> 00:23.795
Oh.

00:23.797 --> 00:25.597
Mm, satiny!

00:25.599 --> 00:26.604
You want to touch it, Mike?

00:26.624 --> 00:28.357
I don't even touch Frankie's face.

00:28.359 --> 00:29.291
He doesn't.

00:30.495 --> 00:32.360
So, Sean, it's nice
to see your chin again.

00:32.363 --> 00:33.996
To what do we owe this change?

00:33.998 --> 00:35.998
Well, Mrs. Heck,
I did great on my MCATs,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.233
and I'm waiting to hear back
from med schools,

00:38.235 --> 00:40.535
and honestly, I just couldn't
take the crying anymore.

00:40.537 --> 00:41.870
It worked!

00:41.872 --> 00:44.173
So what's in the dish?

00:44.175 --> 00:46.108
Ooh! This is my sweet potato casserole.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.277
You have to make it
a week before Thanksgiving

00:48.279 --> 00:50.645
'cause the cinnamon's got
to settle in just right.

00:50.647 --> 00:52.180
But our oven's on the fritz.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.915
That's what I get
for ordering a part from

00:53.917 --> 00:55.049
overseas.

00:55.051 --> 00:57.218
Would you mind terribly if I used yours?

00:57.220 --> 00:58.252
Unless you're using it.

00:58.254 --> 00:59.554
I am, but...

00:59.556 --> 01:01.289
this can go anywhere.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.525
Oh, you're the best.

01:04.528 --> 01:06.361
Okay, we got to dash.

01:06.363 --> 01:08.262
I saw the Norwoods packing up their car,

01:08.264 --> 01:11.132
and I need them to feel
Sean's face before they go.

01:11.134 --> 01:12.266
Hey, when you see Axl,

01:12.268 --> 01:14.202
tell him I'm in town
and I want to see him.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.270
How about if you see Axl,
tell him I want to see him?

01:20.143 --> 01:21.742
Seriously, Mike. This is ridiculous.

01:21.744 --> 01:23.243
We never see him.

01:23.245 --> 01:24.845
I thought you just saw them.

01:24.847 --> 01:27.080
Exactly. "Them." He's never alone.

01:27.082 --> 01:28.949
It's always him and "Ap-ril."

01:28.951 --> 01:31.318
You got to stop saying her name
like "Ap-ril."

01:31.320 --> 01:33.286
Look, I have been trying with April.

01:33.288 --> 01:34.555
I really have.

01:34.557 --> 01:35.689
Like, just today,

01:35.691 --> 01:37.525
when we were waiting for Axl
to buy sneakers,

01:37.527 --> 01:39.526
I thought it'd be nice
to take her for ice cream.

01:39.528 --> 01:41.128
So I order mine.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.729
And then when the guy asks her,
"What do you want?",

01:42.731 --> 01:46.766
she says... get this...
"Oh, I don't like ice cream."

01:46.768 --> 01:48.568
Who doesn't like ice cream?

01:48.570 --> 01:51.104
It's in the song...
"We all scream for ice cream."

01:51.106 --> 01:52.472
It's not, "Some people scream

01:52.474 --> 01:54.674
and other people just watch you
like you're a big pig

01:54.676 --> 01:55.708
'cause you got three scoops."

01:55.710 --> 01:56.843
You got three scoops?

01:56.845 --> 01:58.244
I didn't have breakfast today.

01:58.246 --> 01:59.378
Yeah, you did.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.479
Well, I didn't have a big one.

02:00.481 --> 02:02.015
Yeah, you did! You finished Brick's.

02:02.017 --> 02:03.983
Okay, I'm on a new vitamin
that makes me hungry!

02:03.985 --> 02:06.553
Look, the point is, I love our son.

02:06.555 --> 02:07.787
I mean, he's so handsome,

02:07.789 --> 02:09.589
and he has twinkly eyes
and street smarts,

02:09.591 --> 02:12.224
and if you take away
his horrible disrespect for us

02:12.226 --> 02:14.326
and the fact that he likes
to lay around in his underwear,

02:14.328 --> 02:15.894
he is quite a catch.

02:15.896 --> 02:17.196
I'm sorry.

02:17.198 --> 02:19.098
I think that he could do
better than April.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.599
See, I said it normal that time.

02:20.601 --> 02:21.700
I can't see your face.

02:21.702 --> 02:23.302
Can you see my finger?

02:26.274 --> 02:27.673
Ugh.

02:27.675 --> 02:29.675
Tough day at the office?

02:29.677 --> 02:31.810
Ugh. Yeah. I'm exhausted.

02:31.812 --> 02:33.344
It's already picking up
for Thanksgiving,

02:33.346 --> 02:34.546
and we're short-staffed.

02:34.548 --> 02:36.014
Andy got fired.

02:36.016 --> 02:37.482
He kept asking female customers

02:37.484 --> 02:38.951
if they wanted smokehouse bacon.

02:38.953 --> 02:40.418
It doesn't sound inappropriate,

02:40.420 --> 02:42.540
but if you heard the way
he said it, you'd understand.

02:44.291 --> 02:45.490
Spudsy's is hiring?

02:45.492 --> 02:47.459
Yeah, but Edwin is really picky.

02:47.461 --> 02:49.060
I don't understand what's so hard.

02:49.062 --> 02:50.161
A monkey could do it.

02:50.163 --> 02:51.729
I could do it.

02:51.731 --> 02:53.898
Oh. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.468
Oh, Brick, this isn't
Hot Dog on a Stick.

02:56.470 --> 02:58.603
It's real food preparation.

02:58.605 --> 03:00.605
There's microwaves involved.

03:00.607 --> 03:01.906
You couldn't do it.

03:01.908 --> 03:03.540
You just said a monkey could it.

03:03.542 --> 03:06.376
I meant a highly trained monkey.

03:06.378 --> 03:08.545
Like the ones in commercials
with special talents.

03:08.547 --> 03:10.748
Like wearing a man's suit
and picking up the phone,

03:10.750 --> 03:12.783
pretending to be a stock broker.

03:12.785 --> 03:14.485
Sue, I need cash.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.887
Cindy wants a Fitbit for Christmas.

03:16.889 --> 03:19.623
Yeah, I just don't think
you're right for the job.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.826
There are real safety hazards.
We work with hot cheese.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.128
Let me say this again.

03:24.130 --> 03:26.096
Cindy wants a Fitbit,

03:26.098 --> 03:27.797
and when Cindy
doesn't get what she wants,

03:27.799 --> 03:30.134
Brick doesn't get what he wants.

03:30.136 --> 03:31.602
Reading time.

03:37.575 --> 03:38.708
Mmm!

03:38.710 --> 03:40.376
That smells good. What is it?

03:40.378 --> 03:42.245
It's not ours. It's the Donahues'.

03:42.247 --> 03:44.280
You have to go in at it from the side.

03:44.282 --> 03:45.214
See?

03:45.216 --> 03:46.850
You just lift the crunchy layer

03:46.852 --> 03:49.519
and you leave the corners
underneath so there's support.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.454
- Just scoop it out from the middle.
- Mmhmm.

03:51.456 --> 03:54.423
And then you lay
the crunchy layer back down

03:54.425 --> 03:56.466
like a little granola blankie.

03:57.228 --> 03:58.727
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

03:58.729 --> 04:00.530
Does this taste better
'cause it's wrong?

04:00.532 --> 04:01.830
It tastes better
'cause we didn't make it.

04:01.832 --> 04:02.665
Mmm.

04:02.667 --> 04:03.866
Big news. I'm...

04:03.868 --> 04:05.134
You got the job!

04:05.136 --> 04:07.270
That was kind of my news, Mom.

04:07.272 --> 04:08.637
Big news! I...

04:08.639 --> 04:09.938
You got the job?

04:09.940 --> 04:12.507
Does no one in this house
understand showmanship?

04:12.509 --> 04:15.544
Wow. So Edwin actually hired you.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.312
That's good timing.

04:17.314 --> 04:19.714
You must have gone in
when he was really desperate.

04:19.716 --> 04:21.716
I'm just saying. That's lucky.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.518
Good for you.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.820
Mm. Brick, you got to go get changed.

04:25.822 --> 04:26.888
Axl's on his way over.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.890
We're gonna crank out
the Christmas picture.

04:28.892 --> 04:30.425
Why are we keeping up with this charade?

04:30.427 --> 04:31.759
You're never gonna send them out.

04:31.761 --> 04:32.994
She says this year, she is.

04:34.064 --> 04:36.864
Set your camera to "handsome"! I'm here!

04:36.866 --> 04:38.234
Hi, everybody!

04:38.768 --> 04:40.702
Hi! I'm April!

04:40.704 --> 04:42.870
I-I know. It's me... Brick.

04:43.169 --> 04:44.740
Oh.

04:44.741 --> 04:47.341
I didn't recognize you in your uniform.

04:47.343 --> 04:49.276
Thank you for your service.

04:49.278 --> 04:49.977
Aww.

04:52.281 --> 04:54.215
Well, this is awkward.

04:54.217 --> 04:55.449
- What's awkward?
- Shh!

04:55.451 --> 04:56.684
Don't you see?

04:56.686 --> 04:58.552
If April's here, she's gonna
want to be in the picture.

04:58.554 --> 05:00.554
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay, Mike.

05:00.556 --> 05:02.223
This is a family Christmas picture,

05:02.225 --> 05:03.557
and she's not family.

05:03.559 --> 05:05.926
It simply isn't done. I won't have it.

05:05.928 --> 05:07.060
Why are you talking British?

05:07.062 --> 05:08.862
If she tries to get in the photo,

05:08.864 --> 05:10.231
what are we gonna do, Mike?

05:10.233 --> 05:11.332
What are we gonna do?

05:11.334 --> 05:12.633
We don't have a plan in place for this.

05:12.635 --> 05:15.335
We don't have a plan
for how we want to handle this.

05:15.337 --> 05:18.138
We don't have a tornado plan.
Why don't we start with that?

05:18.140 --> 05:19.505
All right, Mom.

05:19.507 --> 05:21.742
You dragged me over here.
We gonna do this thing, or what?

05:21.744 --> 05:23.877
Okay! Family is looking good.

05:23.879 --> 05:26.880
Let's get this five-person
family photo done!

05:26.882 --> 05:29.116
April! Come on, babe! Get in here!

05:29.118 --> 05:30.617
Um... no.

05:30.619 --> 05:31.917
I-I couldn't.

05:31.919 --> 05:33.819
Yes, you could! Get in here!

05:33.821 --> 05:35.488
You should be in it. Right, Mom?
Don't you think?

05:35.490 --> 05:37.156
Pfft! Totally!

05:37.158 --> 05:38.458
Oh, shoot!

05:38.460 --> 05:40.126
We're all wearing red and April isn't.

05:40.128 --> 05:42.295
Oh! Dang it, dang it, dang it.

05:42.297 --> 05:43.663
Well, maybe we'll catch you next year

05:43.665 --> 05:45.270
if you guys are still together.

05:46.167 --> 05:48.500
Hey, look at that!

05:48.502 --> 05:49.869
I'm wearing red!

05:49.871 --> 05:51.270
Oh, my gosh!

05:51.272 --> 05:53.572
I feel like I just won a game show.

05:53.574 --> 05:57.243
Me too! Oh, my gosh!
"April, come on down!"

05:57.245 --> 05:59.738
Oh, this is great.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.382
Oh, wait a minute. This looks boring.

06:03.384 --> 06:05.083
Let's see. You just go here.

06:05.085 --> 06:07.919
Yeah. And perfect!

06:07.921 --> 06:09.020
Okay.

06:13.394 --> 06:15.059
I miss you. You're so far away.

06:15.061 --> 06:16.528
You'll see her in a second.

06:22.769 --> 06:25.170
Aw! Everybody had their eyes closed.

06:25.172 --> 06:27.405
- You haven't even looked at it yet.
- I have a bad feeling.

06:29.309 --> 06:30.508
Yep, I was right.

06:30.510 --> 06:33.845
Oh. This is silly.
I should just take it.

06:34.302 --> 06:37.048
Really? Oh, my God!
That would be too nice.

06:37.049 --> 06:38.482
Thank you so much!

06:42.021 --> 06:44.522
Okay, everybody get together.
Squeeze in!

06:45.825 --> 06:46.990
Cheese!

06:52.054 --> 06:53.286
Sometimes, siblings working together

06:53.288 --> 06:55.074
is a beautiful thing...

06:55.099 --> 06:56.540
Donny and Marie,

06:56.542 --> 06:57.598
Venus and Serena,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.049
The Property Brothers.

06:59.074 --> 07:01.534
Sue and Brick... not so much.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.521
How many pumps were you
planning on there, cowboy?

07:03.524 --> 07:05.123
One pumps? Two pumps?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.792
I hadn't really thought about it.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.460
Well, you kind of have
to think about it, Brick.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.094
This is not a dress rehearsal.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.963
- This is the show.
- Mmhmm.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.499
So when I ask you, "How many
pumps are you planning?",

07:14.501 --> 07:16.134
you need to have an answer.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.369
Three.

07:17.371 --> 07:18.303
Wow!

07:18.305 --> 07:20.171
Did you just win the lottery?

07:20.173 --> 07:22.140
Pbht! Did you just buy Spudsy's?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.475
Are we called Bricksy's now?

07:24.477 --> 07:26.377
'Cause I can't think of any other way

07:26.379 --> 07:28.713
this place can afford to be giving away

07:28.715 --> 07:31.082
it's 20% real-cheese product.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.351
It is one pump, one tap.

07:34.888 --> 07:35.887
Um, Tim, your...

07:35.889 --> 07:37.154
"Um"? Really?

07:37.156 --> 07:38.889
Brick, this is a hot Mic.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.157
You don't step up to it

07:40.159 --> 07:42.926
till you know exactly
what you're going to say.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.563
Tim, your order's ready.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.964
Wrong!

07:46.966 --> 07:49.199
There is a very specific script.

07:49.201 --> 07:53.570
"Tim, your potato is ready.
Your potato is ready, Tim."

07:53.572 --> 07:56.740
You start with the name
and you end with the name.

07:56.742 --> 07:57.975
If you don't end with Tim

07:57.977 --> 08:00.043
and Tim didn't hear anything
till the last word,

08:00.045 --> 08:01.311
who's getting that potato?

08:01.313 --> 08:02.312
Not Tim!

08:04.383 --> 08:06.083
Excuse me. Can I place my order?

08:07.686 --> 08:09.886
Okay, I think I found a way
to make it work.

08:09.888 --> 08:11.621
I put Doris' head on April's body.

08:11.623 --> 08:12.689
What do you think?

08:14.659 --> 08:17.126
Why don't you put her head
on all our bodies

08:17.128 --> 08:18.561
and have us playing poker?

08:18.563 --> 08:20.329
Then at least it'll be funny.

08:20.331 --> 08:21.731
Damn it!

08:21.733 --> 08:22.999
I thought it was a home run.

08:23.001 --> 08:24.634
Now we're gonna have to take it again.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.271
Why did he have to have her
in the picture?

08:28.273 --> 08:30.273
You see what's happening here, Mike?

08:30.275 --> 08:32.107
He's cementing the relationship.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.509
He wants her in a photo.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.644
Then he's gonna have to have her
for all the holidays.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.313
Oh, my God. Thanksgiving.

08:38.316 --> 08:40.515
All right, you know what?
I'm not a bad person.

08:40.518 --> 08:42.751
I'm not gonna say she can't come.

08:42.753 --> 08:44.887
We have to think of a reason
that she can't come

08:44.889 --> 08:46.288
that won't hurt her feelings.

08:46.290 --> 08:47.790
We have to come up with a plan!

08:47.792 --> 08:49.257
Why don't we ever have a plan?

08:49.259 --> 08:50.992
We didn't have a plan for the picture.

08:50.994 --> 08:52.461
We don't have a plan for Thanksgiving.

08:52.463 --> 08:54.530
We got to start making plans
around here.

08:54.532 --> 08:55.731
I'll get a pen.

08:57.501 --> 08:59.801
Dad, you got to talk to Sue.

08:59.803 --> 09:01.336
She's all over me at work.

09:01.338 --> 09:03.405
We were introducing
the new Feliz Navi-Spud

09:03.407 --> 09:05.640
and she wouldn't let me
salsa any of them.

09:05.642 --> 09:07.275
The handbook said salsa distribution

09:07.277 --> 09:08.810
was at the operator's discretion.

09:09.261 --> 09:11.445
Why do you want to be working
with your sister, anyway?

09:11.448 --> 09:12.713
The whole reason you go to work

09:12.715 --> 09:14.082
is to get away from your family.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:29.432 --> 09:31.999
Dad, you have to talk to Brick.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.534
I would, but I'm going to work.

09:35.537 --> 09:37.171
But wait. But it's Saturday.

09:37.173 --> 09:39.206
Is it?

09:39.208 --> 09:41.241
I...

09:44.213 --> 09:45.745
Axl? April?

09:45.747 --> 09:49.115
Hey, you two! Aww, that's so cute.

09:49.117 --> 09:51.250
Oh, are you shopping for Thanksgiving?

09:51.252 --> 09:55.121
I love Thanksgiving.
It's my second-favorite holiday.

09:55.123 --> 09:57.858
After that one where people
play pranks on each other?

09:57.860 --> 10:00.560
Um... something Fool's Day.

10:00.562 --> 10:02.295
- April?
- Yes?

10:02.297 --> 10:04.430
No, I was saying "April Fool's Day"?

10:04.929 --> 10:06.965
Oh, no. I don't have a middle name.

10:06.968 --> 10:09.068
Well, except for Rose.

10:10.405 --> 10:12.505
So, what are you guys up to?

10:12.507 --> 10:13.606
April's got to get a pie

10:13.608 --> 10:15.208
to bring to her mom's for Thanksgiving.

10:15.777 --> 10:17.776
Oh, so you're going to your parents'?

10:17.778 --> 10:19.078
Oh, shoot.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.314
Mike and I were saying
how great it would have been

10:21.316 --> 10:23.448
if you could have joined us
for dinner this year.

10:23.450 --> 10:26.986
Oh! That's so nice,
but we're already committed.

10:26.988 --> 10:28.821
Axl's making a salad.

10:29.419 --> 10:31.689
You mean you're making a salad,
dropping it off at her house,

10:31.692 --> 10:32.958
and then coming back to our house?

10:32.960 --> 10:35.961
Oh. Man. Oh. I forgot to tell you.

10:35.963 --> 10:38.963
I'm going to April's parents'
for Thanksgiving.

10:38.965 --> 10:40.332
What?

10:40.641 --> 10:42.901
But you have to come home
for Thanksgiving.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.069
It's tradition.

10:44.071 --> 10:45.237
Uh, we didn't do it last year.

10:45.239 --> 10:46.804
The year before that,
we went to King's Feast.

10:48.742 --> 10:52.377
Well, what time do you eat?
You can come to us after.

10:52.379 --> 10:54.646
Ooh! And I skimmed
some of the Donahues' yams,

10:54.648 --> 10:56.614
so you're not gonna want to miss that.

10:56.616 --> 10:57.849
No can do.

10:57.851 --> 10:59.383
Got to get to April's
great aunt right after.

10:59.385 --> 11:00.418
- Right, babe?
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.819
Okay.

11:01.821 --> 11:03.955
Pencil us in right after the great aunt.

11:03.957 --> 11:06.891
Oh, well, then we have our third
Thanksgiving at Grandma Tee-Tee's.

11:06.893 --> 11:10.461
She's losing her memory,
so it's important we see her.

11:10.463 --> 11:12.096
Or you could just tell her you saw her.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.670
Okay, you're not gonna believe this.

11:19.672 --> 11:21.472
Axl wasn't planning on coming home

11:21.474 --> 11:22.673
for Thanksgiving dinner.

11:22.675 --> 11:24.841
What? What do you mean?
He has to be here.

11:24.843 --> 11:27.078
It's okay. I saved it.
I saved Thanksgiving.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.845
They got to see a bunch
of April's family,

11:28.847 --> 11:30.513
so we're just gonna do it here at 8:00.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.582
8:00?

11:31.584 --> 11:33.559
That's so late. We're gonna be starving.

11:33.561 --> 11:35.318
No, no, no, no. 8:00 a.m.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.620
8:00 in the morning?!

11:36.622 --> 11:38.055
Yeah. It's perfect.

11:38.057 --> 11:40.156
We always wake up hungry.
Now we can eat right away.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.459
Why the hell would you agree
to do Thanksgiving

11:42.461 --> 11:43.760
at 8:00 in the morning?

11:43.762 --> 11:45.027
Yeah, Mom. Why?

11:45.029 --> 11:46.662
Why? I'll tell you why.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.898
'Cause I'm the Boy Mom. That's why.

11:48.900 --> 11:52.235
I am fighting for scraps here.
I got no cards, no chips.

11:52.237 --> 11:53.636
I take what I can get.

11:53.638 --> 11:55.371
And what I can get is fourth place

11:55.373 --> 11:57.273
behind April's parents, her great aunt,

11:57.275 --> 11:58.475
and Grandma Tee-Tee.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.410
So if April says
that Thanksgiving dinner's

12:00.412 --> 12:02.511
gonna be at 8:00 a.m.,
I say, "Thank you, ma'am.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.646
I'll see you then!"

12:03.648 --> 12:05.380
And that's the way
it's gonna be from now on.

12:05.382 --> 12:06.415
What does that mean?

12:06.417 --> 12:08.084
It means that if they get married,

12:08.086 --> 12:09.685
do you think I'm gonna have any say

12:09.687 --> 12:11.453
in what color I wear at the wedding?

12:11.455 --> 12:13.155
If she says yellow, I'm wearing yellow.

12:13.157 --> 12:14.323
And when they have a baby,

12:14.325 --> 12:16.258
her mom gets first pick
at the cute grandma names,

12:16.260 --> 12:18.227
like "Meemaw" and "Glamama."

12:18.229 --> 12:19.995
You're getting a little
ahead of yourself.

12:19.997 --> 12:21.263
Am I?

12:21.265 --> 12:23.098
When Betty Horrigan's son
was getting married,

12:23.100 --> 12:24.566
she told her daughter-in-law

12:24.568 --> 12:27.369
she didn't like the calligraphy
on the wedding invitations.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.504
That was 10 years ago.

12:28.506 --> 12:30.272
Now Betty has to hide in the woods

12:30.274 --> 12:31.963
to watch her grandson play soccer.

12:32.676 --> 12:34.676
I still think you caved too early.

12:34.678 --> 12:35.777
Oh, do you think that, Brick?

12:35.779 --> 12:37.211
Well, I'll tell you what I think.

12:37.213 --> 12:39.781
I think this is April's world
and we're just living in it!

12:39.783 --> 12:41.016
She's the gatekeeper now.

12:41.018 --> 12:43.184
- Ugh.
- This is so unfair.

12:43.186 --> 12:45.286
Why do our Thanksgiving plans
have to be ruined

12:45.288 --> 12:48.556
just because the timing
doesn't work out for "Ap-ril."

12:50.360 --> 12:51.592
Say her name again.

12:52.469 --> 12:53.627
April.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.696
That's not how you said it.

12:55.698 --> 12:57.632
You said "Ap-ril."

12:57.634 --> 12:59.467
No, no, no. I don't think I did.

12:59.469 --> 13:00.968
You don't like her.

13:00.970 --> 13:02.002
No! No, no, no, no!

13:02.004 --> 13:03.271
That's not true. I love everybody.

13:03.273 --> 13:04.672
- You don't like her!
- Okay, fine!

13:04.674 --> 13:06.307
I don't like her! There! I said it!

13:06.309 --> 13:07.474
Thank you!

13:07.476 --> 13:08.909
Ugh. She went to the bathroom one time

13:08.911 --> 13:10.911
and she blew her nose into my jeans.

13:10.913 --> 13:12.913
She said, "Sorry.
I thought they were a towel."

13:12.915 --> 13:14.815
Who blows their nose into a towel?!

13:14.817 --> 13:16.150
I don't like her, either!

13:16.152 --> 13:19.053
Cindy said she cannot get
a conversation going with her.

13:19.055 --> 13:21.088
And Cindy can talk to anybody.

13:21.090 --> 13:22.389
And she doesn't like ice cream.

13:22.391 --> 13:23.456
See?!

13:23.458 --> 13:25.925
I mean, all I wanted
was a nice Thanksgiving.

13:25.927 --> 13:27.860
I just want to make
my powder potatoes with Sue

13:27.862 --> 13:30.230
while you and Axl sit
on the couch and watch sports

13:30.232 --> 13:32.432
and Brick does whatever it is he does.

13:32.434 --> 13:34.201
Wait, he's still coming back
for the Colts game

13:34.203 --> 13:35.268
that night, right?

13:35.737 --> 13:38.037
No. He's not coming back.

13:38.039 --> 13:39.606
Grandma Tee-Tee lives in Akron!

13:39.608 --> 13:42.241
What? Wait, no! That is not okay!

13:42.243 --> 13:43.776
Oh, now he wakes up!

13:43.778 --> 13:46.278
Hey! I never liked this girl.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.546
I liked the other ones, you know?

13:47.548 --> 13:48.981
The... The... The smart one
with the red hair

13:48.983 --> 13:50.249
and the sporty one from college.

13:50.251 --> 13:51.751
But I never had
a good feeling about this girl.

13:51.753 --> 13:53.252
And I will tell you right now...

13:53.254 --> 13:55.321
if he doesn't come home
to watch the Colts game,

13:55.323 --> 13:56.988
I don't have a son anymore.

13:56.990 --> 13:58.881
Um, yeah, you do.

13:59.493 --> 14:00.559
Well, buckle up, buttercup,

14:00.561 --> 14:01.993
'cause it happened to Betty Horrigan,

14:01.995 --> 14:03.762
and it can happen to us.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.862
Gross. That's ours.

14:12.463 --> 14:13.663
Thank you, And remember...

14:13.665 --> 14:16.088
consider Spudsy's
for your next birthday party!

14:16.162 --> 14:18.742
Potatoes... it's like a cupcake
but from the dirt.

14:21.269 --> 14:23.470
You're adding too many jalapeños.

14:23.472 --> 14:25.205
Sue, I know what I'm doing.

14:25.207 --> 14:26.907
- Clearly you don't.
- Stop.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.120
There's only supposed to be
one jalapeño per...

14:29.145 --> 14:30.110
No! No!

14:30.112 --> 14:31.644
Stop! Don't touch them with your hands!

14:31.646 --> 14:34.180
Toby, your potato is ready.
Your potato is ready, Toby.

14:34.182 --> 14:36.383
Toby, your potato is not ready.
Your potato is not ready, Toby.

14:36.385 --> 14:38.184
Don't bring Toby into this!
This is between you and me!

14:38.186 --> 14:39.719
Why won't you let me do my job?!

14:39.721 --> 14:41.121
I would, but it takes too...

14:41.123 --> 14:42.922
Aah!

14:42.924 --> 14:43.923
What's wrong?

14:43.925 --> 14:46.025
Jalapeño eye! It burns!

14:46.027 --> 14:47.259
It does?

14:49.230 --> 14:51.230
Aah!

14:51.232 --> 14:53.365
Toby, call for help!
Call for help, Toby!

14:53.367 --> 14:54.500
Ow!

14:54.502 --> 14:57.737
I am very disappointed in you two.

14:57.739 --> 15:00.907
They may tolerate these kinds
of shenanigans at Shenanigans,

15:00.909 --> 15:04.009
but here at Spudsy's,
the bar's a little higher.

15:04.011 --> 15:05.277
Okay?

15:05.279 --> 15:07.312
Now I have to go out there
and give Toby a coupon

15:07.314 --> 15:08.847
for 30 cents off his next purchase.

15:08.849 --> 15:10.749
I don't like to do that.

15:10.751 --> 15:12.151
I swear, if I wasn't planning

15:12.153 --> 15:13.952
to fake a slip-and-fall
behind the counter

15:13.954 --> 15:16.555
and take the holidays off,
I'd fire you both.

15:22.529 --> 15:25.076
You were adding too many jalapeños.

15:25.996 --> 15:28.499
He was gonna pay for the extras.

15:28.501 --> 15:30.068
Edwin told me it was okay.

15:31.438 --> 15:32.804
Oh.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.875
Sue, look. I get it.
You don't want me here.

15:37.877 --> 15:39.743
Spudsy's is your turf,
and I waltz in here

15:39.745 --> 15:41.712
like I've been around potatoes
my whole life.

15:41.714 --> 15:43.281
Of course you would feel threatened.

15:43.283 --> 15:44.915
What? No, I'm not.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.584
Then why are you always on me?

15:46.586 --> 15:48.586
'Cause I'm responsible for you, Brick.

15:48.588 --> 15:50.921
Okay, yes, it's true.
I didn't want you here.

15:50.923 --> 15:52.756
But it's just because it's exhausting

15:52.758 --> 15:54.892
watching and worrying about you
all the time.

15:54.894 --> 15:56.647
Who said you had to watch me?

15:57.630 --> 16:01.531
If you're going to
the park, watch your brother!

16:01.533 --> 16:02.967
Before you get in the pool,

16:02.969 --> 16:05.897
watch and make sure he takes
the rocks out of his pockets!

16:06.739 --> 16:08.371
Watch him at the hamburger place!

16:08.373 --> 16:10.470
Last time, he ate a wet nap!

16:11.774 --> 16:14.611
It's always been my job
to watch out for you.

16:14.613 --> 16:16.879
I guess it's just a hard habit to break.

16:17.558 --> 16:19.483
Yeah, but I'm in high school now.

16:19.485 --> 16:21.618
I have a friend. I have a girlfriend.

16:21.620 --> 16:22.990
I have a font club.

16:23.589 --> 16:25.888
I never want you
to stop looking out for me.

16:25.890 --> 16:28.324
It's just I think maybe
you can step back a little bit

16:28.326 --> 16:31.183
'cause... I got it.

16:34.899 --> 16:36.499
Where'd all the bacon bits go?

16:36.990 --> 16:38.602
Oh. I ate them.

16:38.603 --> 16:39.902
- What?
- Oh.

16:39.904 --> 16:41.637
You said I could have a shift meal.

16:41.639 --> 16:44.072
You ate five pounds of bacon bits?

16:44.074 --> 16:45.907
My mom ate my breakfast.

16:46.305 --> 16:49.011
You are a freaky little dude.

16:52.916 --> 16:55.017
Okay, Axl's coming over

16:55.019 --> 16:56.952
and we're taking another crack
at the Christmas photo.

16:56.954 --> 16:59.487
And shut up. I am sending it out!

16:59.489 --> 17:01.322
Okay, well, won't April be with him?

17:01.324 --> 17:02.423
No. I took care of that.

17:02.425 --> 17:03.725
I texted him
that Dad's having chest pains

17:03.727 --> 17:04.925
and that he should come alone

17:04.928 --> 17:06.327
'cause he knows
Dad wouldn't be comfortable

17:06.329 --> 17:08.296
dying in front of strangers.

17:08.298 --> 17:10.766
Mom! Mom!

17:10.768 --> 17:11.867
Where's my chair?

17:11.868 --> 17:12.934
What?

17:12.935 --> 17:14.868
You texted me, "Dad has chair plans."

17:14.871 --> 17:17.038
I texted, "Dad has chest pains."

17:17.040 --> 17:19.507
Oh, my God. So I'm not getting a chair?

17:19.509 --> 17:21.008
Just put on the shirt.

17:21.010 --> 17:22.510
We're retaking the Christmas picture.

17:22.512 --> 17:23.778
But I thought Dad had chest pains.

17:23.780 --> 17:25.547
Y... False alarm. You know your dad.

17:25.549 --> 17:26.866
He's very dramatic.

17:27.416 --> 17:29.350
I've got the trunk open for the chair,

17:29.352 --> 17:30.985
but there's a big engine in the way.

17:30.987 --> 17:32.720
Wasted trip.
They're not getting me a chair.

17:32.722 --> 17:34.488
We just got to take this stupid picture.

17:34.490 --> 17:37.324
Um, nope. Never mind. You were right.

17:37.326 --> 17:39.326
I was never gonna send it anyway, so...

17:39.328 --> 17:42.063
You two are free to go.
I'll see you on Thanksgiving.

17:42.065 --> 17:44.031
I don't know how hungry
we're gonna be at 8:00,

17:44.033 --> 17:46.233
but you can always take
leftovers to your grandma.

17:46.618 --> 17:47.734
Grandma?

17:47.736 --> 17:49.469
Yeah. Grandma Tee-Tee.

17:49.745 --> 17:50.738
Oh!

17:50.739 --> 17:52.872
We just call her Grandma Tee-Tee.

17:52.874 --> 17:54.541
She was really our babysitter.

17:55.106 --> 17:57.877
So she's not actually related?

17:57.879 --> 17:59.313
Oh, no. She is.

17:59.315 --> 18:01.415
To somebody. Just not to us.

18:04.586 --> 18:05.585
Well, we got stuff to do.

18:05.587 --> 18:06.686
We're not gonna hang around

18:06.688 --> 18:07.887
if there ain't no chair in it for me.

18:07.889 --> 18:09.122
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:13.161 --> 18:14.427
Are you kidding me?

18:14.429 --> 18:15.995
We're eating at the crack of dawn

18:15.997 --> 18:18.064
so they can go to Akron
to see her babysitter?

18:18.066 --> 18:19.599
She's not even related!

18:19.601 --> 18:21.734
And, by the way, not a good babysitter

18:21.736 --> 18:23.703
'cause she obviously dropped
April on her head a few times.

18:23.705 --> 18:25.170
Try a few hundred times.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.307
So, this girl
just controls everything now?

18:28.309 --> 18:30.175
She's calling the shots?
Is that what's happening?

18:30.177 --> 18:33.912
I mean, I would get it if she's
some great catch, but she's not.

18:33.914 --> 18:36.514
Axl could have had his pick
of anyone and he picks April?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.416
She's a moron, an idiot.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.353
If breathing wasn't automatic,
she'd be dead!

18:46.227 --> 18:48.193
Axl. Oh, God.

18:50.898 --> 18:55.012
No. It's out there now,
so I'm just gonna say it.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.469
This is not the girl for you.

18:57.471 --> 18:58.670
You are special.

18:58.672 --> 19:01.306
You are special, Axl,
and April is just not!

19:01.308 --> 19:03.875
Yes, she's nice and innocent
and she's got big eyes

19:03.877 --> 19:06.010
and she's like a baby deer
in human form,

19:06.012 --> 19:07.746
but she's not good enough for you!

19:07.748 --> 19:09.013
And, yeah, I'm the Boy Mom,

19:09.015 --> 19:11.182
and I should just shut up
and smile and wear yellow,

19:11.184 --> 19:12.549
but not for this girl.

19:12.551 --> 19:13.885
I will not stand by quietly

19:13.887 --> 19:15.987
and watch you make the
biggest mistake of your life.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.871
She is not the one for you, Axl!
She's not the one!

19:36.542 --> 19:40.243
It's still dark outside.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.578
- Are we really doing this?
- Of course!

19:42.580 --> 19:45.682
It's good 'cause then we'll be
hungry for leftovers by lunch.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.317
Oh! We should do this every year.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.518
I think I love it!

19:49.040 --> 19:50.253
No, no, no, no.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.669
Let's wait till they get here.

19:56.594 --> 19:59.028
Well, you know,
Axl's late for everything.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.096
He was late coming out,
and that was no picnic.

20:06.170 --> 20:09.305
Do you think maybe he's not coming?

20:09.307 --> 20:11.774
What? Because of yesterday?

20:11.776 --> 20:12.942
No!

20:12.944 --> 20:14.677
That's just how we are.

20:14.679 --> 20:15.911
He calls me gross,

20:15.913 --> 20:17.679
and I say his girlfriend
isn't good enough for him.

20:17.681 --> 20:18.814
It's banter.

20:18.816 --> 20:20.950
We're very Italian and Jewish that way.

20:20.952 --> 20:22.985
We speak with our hands,
and we're passionate.

20:22.987 --> 20:25.754
We say things we shouldn't
and then we're fine!

20:30.494 --> 20:32.060
Well...

20:32.062 --> 20:33.995
maybe we should just start eating.

20:33.997 --> 20:35.697
Before everything gets cold.

20:35.699 --> 20:37.566
He won't mind.

20:51.207 --> 20:54.487
And thank you, Lord,
for giving us Sean's face back.

20:55.807 --> 20:59.276
And for the Hecks,
the best neighbors in the world,

20:59.278 --> 21:03.280
who let us use their oven
to enjoy your beautiful bounty.

21:03.282 --> 21:05.215
Amen.

21:05.217 --> 21:05.994
Okay.

21:06.019 --> 21:06.880
- Let's dig in!
- Oh!

21:06.905 --> 21:07.884
This looks so good!

21:07.886 --> 21:08.984
Smells delicious!

21:12.990 --> 21:14.690
- Mom?
- It's gone.

21:14.692 --> 21:15.858
Weird.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.226
Um... Mom.
