00:47.820 --> 00:49.100
Oh, God...

00:49.660 --> 00:52.820
God, grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change...

00:52.860 --> 00:55.660
Why do you fight it so hard,
Earl?

00:55.780 --> 00:57.780
The courage to change the things
that I can...

00:57.820 --> 01:01.460
Come on,
You've been a good boy for a long time,

01:01.540 --> 01:03.180
You know you want to do this,

01:03.220 --> 01:05.459
And wisdom...

01:06.100 --> 01:08.980
Wisdom to know the difference,

01:16.660 --> 01:20.540
Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it,

01:20.580 --> 01:23.700
Trusting that He will make all things
right if I surrender to His will,

01:23.740 --> 01:26.500
that I may be reasonably happy in this life

01:26.540 --> 01:29.660
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next,

01:29.700 --> 01:31.060
Amen,

01:31.580 --> 01:35.020
I could go on and on
about what a great guy Earl is,

01:35.060 --> 01:38.100
how he gives so freely of his time
and his money,

01:38.420 --> 01:40.140
even how he...

01:40.660 --> 01:43.060
Well, even how he cuts his toenails.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.660
Let's get Earl up here to speak for himself.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a businessman,

01:51.740 --> 01:53.100
philanthropist,

01:53.140 --> 01:54.820
a very dear friend,

01:54.860 --> 01:57.740
and the Portland Chamber of Commerce
Man of the Year,

01:57.780 --> 01:59.220
Mr. Earl Brooks!

02:05.980 --> 02:08.419
Thank you all very much.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.460
The first thing I would like
to say is that I...

02:15.420 --> 02:18.220
I don't even know how I cut my toenails.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.460
Twenty years ago,

02:24.620 --> 02:28.900
when I started the Brooks Box Factories,
I never dreamed I would...

02:36.700 --> 02:39.820
I never dreamed
that I would one day be standing here.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.700
Did you see Sis Wallace's dress?

02:53.860 --> 02:56.900
You could see her nipples.
At her age. Wow.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.860
She's got to keep those things hidden.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.140
The only thing that would have made
this evening more perfect

03:03.180 --> 03:05.380
is if Jane had been here.

03:06.540 --> 03:09.380
Emma, she called
to congratulate me, all right?

03:09.420 --> 03:11.940
She has midterms coming up.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.020
I think she's dropping out.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.060
We'll see.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.740
Nothing she does is wrong to you, is it?

03:23.140 --> 03:25.820
Well, she missed a good party.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.660
It's not like it's not set up.

03:37.340 --> 03:40.740
You already know
how to bypass the alarms.

03:40.780 --> 03:44.100
- You know how to pick the locks.
- No.

03:44.980 --> 03:47.820
You're the fucking Man of the Year.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.100
You deserve a treat.

03:49.140 --> 03:50.700
No, Marshall. I said no.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.740
Well, I heard you.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.660
But you don't mean no.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.740
What's wrong?

04:01.700 --> 04:02.940
Nothing.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.380
You're frowning.

04:07.460 --> 04:10.900
I'm thinking about
what I didn't say in the speech.

04:11.340 --> 04:12.780
Honey.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.820
It was so moving.

04:16.260 --> 04:18.380
You made us all laugh.

04:18.700 --> 04:21.420
I don't think anybody felt left out.

04:25.340 --> 04:28.100
They have their dance class tonight.

04:29.380 --> 04:33.420
We could just drive by and look at them.

04:33.460 --> 04:36.300
There's no harm in just having a look.

04:36.940 --> 04:39.660
- No means no, Marshall.
- Please.

04:40.140 --> 04:41.820
Pretty please.

04:53.140 --> 04:58.100
I thought the food tonight was very good,
but I was not crazy about the dessert.

04:59.180 --> 05:02.460
Would you like to stop somewhere and
get something sweet?

05:02.500 --> 05:03.900
Okay.

05:08.580 --> 05:11.020
I know that I don't want a small dog.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.180
Labradors are supposed to be great.

05:13.220 --> 05:15.540
The Voltes have
always had golden retrievers.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.660
They're very happy with them.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.620
There's an Irish Lab that I read about.

05:23.660 --> 05:27.300
It's a little smaller in build
and still as playful.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.700
Standard poodles.
People are very happy with them.

05:31.860 --> 05:35.020
But maybe a rescue mutt.
What do you think?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.860
Don't let me do this.
Don't let me do this, please.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.260
I don't want to start again.

05:58.700 --> 06:03.020
You promised, Earl.
You promised. Please. Please.

06:03.260 --> 06:06.580
Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

06:25.340 --> 06:27.820
I'm going to stay up awhile,

06:28.220 --> 06:31.620
maybe go to the studio
and play with some glazes.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.060
Okay.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.140
I'm going to read.

06:36.180 --> 06:39.420
If I'm not awake,
wake me when you come back.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.860
By the way,

06:50.140 --> 06:53.540
I thought you were wonderful tonight,
Mrs. Brooks.

06:53.820 --> 06:55.940
Thank you, Mr. Brooks.

08:07.340 --> 08:11.980
Oh, lordy, Earl my boy, I have missed this.
We are going to have so much fun.

08:12.020 --> 08:16.580
This is the last time, Marshall.
Understand me. It's the very last time.

09:15.860 --> 09:18.380
Don't you dare quit on me,
you piece of shit.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.020
I want to see what they're doing.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.180
Hello.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.900
Be quiet.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.500
Sit up.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.580
Whoa, Earl.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.980
What the fuck is this?

11:09.060 --> 11:12.700
These fucking pigs like to do it with
the curtains open.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.860
You should have known that.
This is a big mistake for you, Earl.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.180
Almost like I want to get caught,
huh, Marshall?

11:21.220 --> 11:24.300
Well, don't fucking do that.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.180
I don't think either of us would enjoy

11:27.220 --> 11:31.100
spending the rest of our lives
on death row, or a lethal injection.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.660
Yes, sir.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.460
Oh, God, forgive me. Forgive me.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.220
Please forgive me.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.460
Please forgive me. Please.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.460
Please forgive me.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.500
Oh, God, please forgive me.

12:42.660 --> 12:46.020
You're a fucking artist, Earl.
I'll give you that.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.940
Don't even think about it.

12:56.060 --> 12:58.020
You know the rules.

13:20.900 --> 13:24.420
Now go upstairs
and make love to your beautiful wife.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.820
Can we have the room, please?

13:45.420 --> 13:46.980
Thank you.

13:49.940 --> 13:52.740
There's your thumbprint, right there.

13:53.220 --> 13:56.020
- One his, one hers?
- That's what it looks like.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.940
This guy hasn't been active
for over two years.

13:59.380 --> 14:03.580
He always rearranges the bodies,
but this is way out of character.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.700
Usually, it's much more romantic,

14:06.940 --> 14:09.700
arms around each other, kissing,

14:09.980 --> 14:12.460
mouths open, tongues touching.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.780
The bullets went straight
through the victims.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.380
The killer recovered the slugs.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.220
Were these open or closed
when you got here?

14:25.260 --> 14:26.740
Closed.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.340
Hmm.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.260
Could be the work of a copycat.

14:34.940 --> 14:39.340
No, it's never been revealed to the public
that the killer retrieves his slugs.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.460
Jesus. I was hoping
this guy was either dead

14:41.500 --> 14:43.500
or in jail on some other charge.

14:47.820 --> 14:51.820
We checked the whole neighborhood.
So far, nobody saw a thing.

14:53.220 --> 14:58.020
Leaving them like this, he must've been
really angry at them for some reason.

15:04.620 --> 15:07.660
Where would they keep their
vacuum cleaner?

15:11.580 --> 15:15.500
So, I'll bet you 100 bucks, Hawkins,
that there's no bag in this vacuum cleaner.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.860
I have no idea
what the hell you looking for.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.060
He vacuumed the house

15:20.460 --> 15:22.340
and took the bag.

15:23.980 --> 15:27.100
Well, what if he killed somebody that
didn't have a vacuum cleaner?

15:27.140 --> 15:28.820
He wouldn't do that.

15:33.220 --> 15:36.620
Our best hope is if someone in there
saw something.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.460
- Detective Tracy Atwood?
- Yes?

15:38.500 --> 15:41.380
Hi. This is for you. You've been served.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.740
You fucking asshole! I am in the middle
of a fucking murder investigation.

15:44.780 --> 15:47.060
- Listen, lady, I'm just the messenger.
- Hawkins, what's the deal here?

15:47.100 --> 15:49.900
Conroy, get this ass out of here.

15:49.940 --> 15:51.540
What is it?

15:52.220 --> 15:55.580
My soon-to-be-ex-husband's scumbag
lawyer trying to show me

15:55.620 --> 15:58.820
just how painful she can make my life
if I don't give them what they want.

15:59.660 --> 16:01.460
Are there any new members?

16:01.500 --> 16:03.100
Okay.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.980
Hello, my name is Vaughn.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.620
I'm an alcoholic

16:10.660 --> 16:13.380
and I haven't had a drink in 10 months.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.500
Hi. My name's Earl

16:22.540 --> 16:24.140
and I'm an addict.

16:31.660 --> 16:34.740
- Anyone else?
- You are such a fucking hypocrite.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.780
If you were honest
you'd step up there and say,

16:36.820 --> 16:39.460
"Hi, I'm Earl. I killed two people last night.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.700
"I really got off on it,
but I need your help to be cured."

16:44.460 --> 16:48.060
I'm different, Marshall.
I won't argue that with you.

16:48.660 --> 16:51.020
But this is the only place that has ever
helped me be normal

16:51.060 --> 16:55.460
and I have been straight,
up until last night, for the past two years.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.060
I'm not going to kill again

17:00.100 --> 17:04.060
and I am not going to quit coming here
because it upsets you.

17:05.099 --> 17:08.060
We need a clean-up crew for afterwards.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.500
We need some volunteers for the...

17:10.579 --> 17:12.619
Thank you, Earl. I appreciate that.

17:23.859 --> 17:26.980
Based on your requirements,
this is our first attempt...

17:27.020 --> 17:30.900
Mr, Brooks, your daughter
is waiting for you in your office,

17:33.140 --> 17:35.300
Well, I hope this is what you had in mind.

17:35.340 --> 17:39.220
If not, we would love to work with you
further on the design.

17:39.260 --> 17:42.180
It's always fun to challenge our machines.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.220
Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me,

17:44.260 --> 17:47.540
I need to see how much
this is going to cost me.

17:48.140 --> 17:50.860
Understand. Daughter cost money.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.500
Me, too.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.500
I believe you do understand.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.820
Matt Johnson wants to schedule
a lunch for Friday. Can I talk to...

17:59.860 --> 18:02.740
- Sunday, did...
- Can you hold just a second?

18:04.980 --> 18:07.060
Did Jane call and say she was coming?

18:07.100 --> 18:10.020
I would have given you that message,
Mr. Brooks.

18:10.460 --> 18:12.500
- She in there?
- Yeah. She...

18:12.660 --> 18:15.660
She has some boxes
and suitcases downstairs.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.340
And she didn't have any money
for the cab.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.540
And you paid for that?

18:20.580 --> 18:22.180
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.260
- Hold my calls.
- Sure.

18:24.340 --> 18:26.060
I told you.

18:26.460 --> 18:28.460
When it's appropriate.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.380
You let me know.

18:31.660 --> 18:33.060
And could I have some water?

18:34.180 --> 18:36.060
Hello, gorgeous.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.500
What are you doing here?

18:40.540 --> 18:42.420
I'm sorry, Daddy.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.580
Please don't be angry with me.

18:45.620 --> 18:48.140
All right, I can guess what you've done,
but why don't you tell me,

18:48.180 --> 18:50.620
and then I'll decide.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.540
I dropped out of school.

18:56.140 --> 18:57.260
Oh, Jane.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.020
Okay, have you told your mother?

19:00.060 --> 19:01.980
No, I wanted to talk to you first.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.860
Well, you're going to have to tell her,
Jane, all right?

19:03.900 --> 19:05.540
I'm not going to do that for you.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.060
- Why can't you...
- Sit.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.980
And then, together,
the three of us will decide

19:12.020 --> 19:13.500
where to go from here.

19:13.540 --> 19:17.740
Okay, but I've thought a lot about this.
College is a waste of time for me.

19:18.380 --> 19:19.780
How does...

19:20.020 --> 19:23.300
How does somebody know that halfway
through their freshman year?

19:23.340 --> 19:26.100
You didn't even go to college, Daddy,
and you're successful.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.500
I want to come work for you.

19:30.500 --> 19:34.180
She's not telling you everything.
She's hiding something.

19:34.460 --> 19:35.900
I know.

19:39.660 --> 19:41.100
I'm not hiring right now, sweetheart.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.860
Okay, but just listen to me for one second.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.180
Jane.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.380
All right.

19:45.420 --> 19:47.220
Look, what would happen to the business,

19:47.260 --> 19:50.540
if, God forbid,
something were to happen to you?

19:50.980 --> 19:52.020
Okay.

19:52.060 --> 19:55.140
Mom would probably have to
sell to strangers.

19:55.180 --> 19:57.100
Now, look,
I'm willing to start at the bottom.

19:57.140 --> 19:59.780
You can treat me like a regular employee.

19:59.820 --> 20:04.100
I just want to learn everything there is
to know about running the box business.

20:04.140 --> 20:06.500
Then, when the time comes,

20:07.180 --> 20:09.460
it can stay in the family.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.940
Hmm.

20:12.260 --> 20:14.420
Well, that's sweet, honey, but

20:14.460 --> 20:17.220
you're not talking about business.
You're talking about emotion.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.780
Now, get up.

20:18.820 --> 20:22.500
In fact, your mother and I came this close
to selling out last year.

20:22.540 --> 20:23.620
- What?
- That's right.

20:23.660 --> 20:25.340
And had we been offered
a little more money,

20:25.380 --> 20:28.780
and they still may come back to us,
we would sell.

20:29.340 --> 20:30.900
What would you do without the business?

20:33.340 --> 20:34.740
Yes?

20:36.700 --> 20:40.020
I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I give this to you.

20:40.060 --> 20:43.860
He claims that you'll find what's
inside very interesting.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.100
What is he, Sunday? Is he a salesman?

20:46.140 --> 20:49.140
I've never seen him before. I'll just
give it back to him. I'll tell him to call...

20:49.180 --> 20:51.300
No, Sunday. Sunday, here.

20:52.340 --> 20:53.700
Thank you.

20:57.220 --> 20:58.460
Jane,

20:58.660 --> 21:02.780
part of spending four years at college
is to give yourself a chance

21:02.820 --> 21:04.540
to find out

21:10.500 --> 21:12.300
who you are

21:12.860 --> 21:15.060
and what you want to do.

21:16.340 --> 21:19.780
I'll talk to Mom,
but I'm not going back to school.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.420
Mmm-hmm.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.940
And where would you live?

21:25.220 --> 21:27.140
To save money, I would move back home.

21:27.180 --> 21:30.380
But no rules, no curfew.
I want to be treated as an adult.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.740
And would you pay for rent?

21:33.940 --> 21:35.580
Hmm?

21:36.180 --> 21:38.020
Would you pay for food?

21:38.260 --> 21:42.620
No, Dad. You're a very wealthy man.
I think you can afford to keep me.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.060
Sunday, would you show the gentleman
who gave you the envelope

21:46.100 --> 21:49.100
into the conference room and tell him
that I will meet him there?

21:49.140 --> 21:50.540
No problem, Mr, Brooks,

21:50.580 --> 21:51.820
And...

21:54.140 --> 21:56.700
What happened to the BMW, Jane?

21:57.380 --> 22:01.300
A friend's going to drive it up.
It'll be here next weekend.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.460
And get Jane a cab.

22:06.940 --> 22:09.060
Call your mother.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.100
Are you going to give me a job?

22:12.380 --> 22:16.220
If it were up to me, and I think your
mother will agree with this,

22:16.980 --> 22:19.780
I think you should go back to school.

22:19.980 --> 22:21.380
You see that, Marshall?

22:21.820 --> 22:25.140
That's why I didn't want to
do the dance couple!

22:25.260 --> 22:27.860
Stop your fucking whining, Earl.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.820
You enjoyed doing that couple just as
much as I did.

22:30.860 --> 22:32.660
And look at the bright side.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.260
He came to us. He didn't go to the cops.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.220
If he tries to shake us down, we kill him,
period!

22:38.260 --> 22:40.780
We make it fun, but we kill him.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.100
End of story.

22:55.580 --> 22:57.780
What can I do for you, Mr...

22:57.820 --> 23:01.260
Let's say Smith.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.420
Okay, Mr. Smith.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.980
Before you get the wrong impression,
Mr. Brooks,

23:08.020 --> 23:10.180
I'm not here to shake you down.

23:10.220 --> 23:14.020
Well, then, these are the only copies of
these photos, and you have no others.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.340
No. I have other copies and other photos.

23:16.380 --> 23:18.420
And if anything happens to me...

23:18.460 --> 23:20.980
How did you find me, Mr. Smith?

23:21.300 --> 23:24.140
You're Man of the Year, Mr. Brooks.

23:26.580 --> 23:28.380
Your picture was in the paper.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.500
And if it hadn't have been...

23:32.260 --> 23:35.060
I don't know.
I don't know what I would've done.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.660
Lucky me.

23:37.060 --> 23:39.420
What is it that I can help you with?

23:39.460 --> 23:42.460
I've been watching that couple for months.

23:43.060 --> 23:46.340
Yeah. They liked to make love
with the blinds opened.

23:46.380 --> 23:49.620
Sometimes I would take pictures.

23:49.660 --> 23:52.180
You know, visual aids for later.

23:54.780 --> 23:56.860
It's a great way to get off, I'll tell you that.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.860
It was fun, I thought,

23:58.900 --> 24:01.100
until I saw you kill them.

24:01.820 --> 24:03.820
And I have never, ever

24:03.860 --> 24:07.380
felt a rush like that, ever.

24:11.980 --> 24:14.700
I know you're the Thumbprint Killer.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.020
You've done this before.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.860
What I want...

24:20.500 --> 24:21.660
What I want

24:21.700 --> 24:25.740
is for you to take me with you
next time you kill someone.

24:26.460 --> 24:28.900
And I'd like that to be soon.

24:37.540 --> 24:40.060
And you were worried
this was going to be unpleasant?

24:40.100 --> 24:41.660
The answer is simple.

24:41.700 --> 24:45.780
Just tell Mr. Smith
that you've decided never to kill again

24:45.820 --> 24:47.340
and he'll go away.

24:47.380 --> 24:50.020
You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

24:50.060 --> 24:51.820
In a word, yes.

24:52.460 --> 24:55.660
Where do you think
he has the other pictures?

24:57.020 --> 24:59.780
He put them in a safety deposit box,

25:00.300 --> 25:04.860
but I'll bet the box is at the bank
where he keeps his checking account,

25:05.100 --> 25:06.820
and the key

25:09.100 --> 25:11.340
is on his key chain.

25:12.780 --> 25:15.220
He really wants to do this.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.460
He's not going to the cops.

25:24.580 --> 25:26.340
We have a deal?

25:29.860 --> 25:32.020
From the angle of these pictures,
you live on the third floor

25:32.060 --> 25:36.340
of the apartment building across the alley
from the couple's house.

25:37.540 --> 25:40.180
- Well...
- Yes or no, Mr. Smith?

25:40.980 --> 25:42.340
Yes.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.700
What time do you get home from work?

25:44.740 --> 25:47.540
6:30, 7:00, depending on the traffic.

25:49.820 --> 25:51.420
You can never come here again.

25:51.460 --> 25:54.460
You can never call me.
Do you understand that?

25:54.500 --> 25:55.820
Yes.

25:56.140 --> 25:57.500
Okay.

25:58.980 --> 26:00.900
Tomorrow night.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.660
Not tonight. Tomorrow night at 8:00,

26:03.700 --> 26:06.700
leave your apartment building
and walk east.

26:06.740 --> 26:08.860
I'll pick you up there.

26:13.980 --> 26:19.140
- lf you're thinking about doing anything...
- We're both aware of the rules, Mr. Smith.

26:20.820 --> 26:23.140
But I feel I must warn you.

26:23.620 --> 26:26.540
If it turns out that you enjoy killing,

26:26.780 --> 26:29.220
it can become very addictive.

26:29.780 --> 26:32.020
It could ruin your life.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.140
I want to do this.

26:35.980 --> 26:37.500
Okay.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.820
Have I covered everything?

26:42.860 --> 26:45.380
I can't think of anything else.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.820
Then I'll see you tomorrow night,
Mr. Smith.

27:00.380 --> 27:01.780
We've talked to our client

27:01.820 --> 27:05.860
and we've come up with a figure
that we feel is more than fair.

27:07.180 --> 27:10.180
We can have a check for that amount
in your office by 6:00.

27:10.220 --> 27:14.180
Oh, well, we told you in the beginning
what we wanted. That hasn't changed.

27:14.220 --> 27:17.380
We feel our offer is more than generous.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.860
I paid for everything
while we were together.

27:19.900 --> 27:23.620
And now I'm being asked
to give this guy a bonus?

27:24.380 --> 27:28.900
For spending time with me? Time that I've
already paid for in the first place?

27:28.940 --> 27:32.900
You know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not going to get $1.5 million.

27:32.940 --> 27:35.700
Oh, I don't know that. No.

27:35.740 --> 27:39.540
Well, in fact, this is the front page of
yesterday's paper.

27:40.980 --> 27:42.980
"Hangman escapes."

27:43.020 --> 27:47.660
"After torturing his victims, Thorton
Meeks would hang them in public places,

27:47.700 --> 27:50.780
"church steeples, balconies,
freeway overpasses..."

27:50.820 --> 27:52.580
Where is this going?

27:52.620 --> 27:55.900
Well, your client captured Mr. Meeks.

27:55.980 --> 27:59.420
Come on, Tracy,
this is not a lot of money for you.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.420
And we both know how frightened I was

28:01.460 --> 28:04.220
after Meeks said he was going to escape
and come back and kill you.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.140
Let me ask again.

28:06.460 --> 28:07.620
What is your point?

28:07.660 --> 28:11.220
Our point is that Meeks
or someone like Meeks

28:11.260 --> 28:14.900
may come after my client
in order to hurt your client.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.580
That's very imaginative, counselor,

28:17.620 --> 28:20.460
but it's not based in reality at all.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.700
Jesse?

28:21.740 --> 28:23.860
Now, just let us handle this, please?

28:23.900 --> 28:24.980
- Tracy...
- Jesse,

28:25.020 --> 28:28.740
you know what would make me feel
really safe right now?

28:31.260 --> 28:33.460
If you got hit by a truck

28:33.500 --> 28:35.100
and died.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.460
Well, that's it.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.660
Mr. Vialo and I are leaving.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.340
You've threatened the safety of my client.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.620
We're going to have to
get a restraining order.

28:45.660 --> 28:47.580
See you in court.

28:48.740 --> 28:51.220
"Get hit by a truck and die."

28:52.620 --> 28:54.820
Fuck it. It felt good.

28:55.020 --> 28:58.140
It's not what's here,
it's what's not here that's interesting.

28:58.180 --> 29:01.220
I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd say
these people were killed by a ghost.

29:01.260 --> 29:05.420
The autopsy said there was a tiny piece
of plastic in the female victim's brain.

29:05.460 --> 29:07.060
It's a dead end. He bags the gun.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.300
He puts a one-gallon plastic freezer
bag over his hand to his wrist.

29:10.340 --> 29:14.620
The little bit of plastic comes out with
the first slug and the shells go in the bag.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.100
I hear you're looking for me.

29:16.140 --> 29:19.180
I received a subpoena from your husband
for your work records,

29:19.220 --> 29:22.740
where you were, date and times,
for the past two years.

29:22.780 --> 29:24.580
They're just trying to blackmail me
into a settlement,

29:24.620 --> 29:26.980
but my lawyers assure me
that it'll never go to court.

29:27.020 --> 29:29.220
I can't take that chance.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.780
Almost three quarters
of your cases are current,

29:31.820 --> 29:35.900
so until you settle your divorce,
I'm going to have to put you on a desk.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.020
That's also blackmail.

29:38.580 --> 29:40.740
Do you have any idea
what this guy has done to me?

29:40.780 --> 29:43.860
While we were married?
While I was paying for everything?

29:43.900 --> 29:46.620
He was just out fucking every woman
he could get his hands on.

29:46.660 --> 29:49.220
He fucked my friends.
He fucked my cousin!

29:49.260 --> 29:51.220
- He made me look like an idiot.
- And?

29:51.260 --> 29:52.980
And what?

29:53.020 --> 29:54.660
Get over it.

29:55.100 --> 29:58.140
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one lousy man in your life.

29:58.180 --> 29:59.060
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one lousy man in your life.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.260
Well, I made him an offer and I'm not
going to give him a dime more.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.860
- Did you hear that Meeks escaped?
- Yeah.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.420
I've got every unit looking for him.
Do you want me to put a detail on you?

30:08.460 --> 30:11.100
I think I can take care of myself.

30:11.580 --> 30:16.420
That's one of your biggest problems,
Tracy. You don't know how to ask for help.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.180
What the fuck? What the fuck?

31:05.540 --> 31:06.820
Don't worry.

31:06.860 --> 31:10.420
If I were here to kill you,
you would already be dead.

31:13.660 --> 31:18.300
After you left today, I realized that
our friendship was a little one-sided.

31:18.340 --> 31:22.420
So, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind as to bring

31:22.460 --> 31:26.100
all the pictures and the memory card
from your camera?

31:26.340 --> 31:29.940
That way we can like each other
simply for who we are.

31:30.340 --> 31:32.540
If you don't show up,

31:32.780 --> 31:35.820
I will presume that
you've gone to the police

31:35.860 --> 31:37.860
and I will kill you.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.020
Even if I go to jail because of you,
Mr. Smith,

31:40.060 --> 31:43.060
someone will find you, wherever you are,

31:43.220 --> 31:45.340
and they will kill you.

31:53.180 --> 31:54.820
Mr. Brooks?

31:58.100 --> 31:59.660
Mr. Brooks?

31:59.700 --> 32:00.940
Mr. Brooks.

32:13.180 --> 32:14.740
Mr. Brooks?

32:32.700 --> 32:34.060
Wow!

33:18.740 --> 33:21.140
It's nice to have you home.

33:33.860 --> 33:35.260
Doesn't my happiness mean anything...

33:35.300 --> 33:36.340
Hello. Hello.

33:36.380 --> 33:40.780
You have to explain things to me
because I'm your mother. That's why.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.700
What's wrong, girls?

33:50.580 --> 33:51.820
Hmm?

33:55.220 --> 33:57.780
Ask your daughter what the real reason is
she dropped out of school.

33:57.820 --> 34:00.140
I told you, it's not the real reason.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.220
Honey, you wanted to go to college.

34:02.260 --> 34:04.940
You had good grades. Your father pulled in
favors to get you into that school.

34:04.980 --> 34:08.100
If this isn't the reason, then please,
dear God, tell me the reason.

34:08.139 --> 34:12.060
Why does your mother think
that you've dropped out of school?

34:14.219 --> 34:15.380
I'm pregnant.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.940
But that's not the reason I dropped out.

34:16.980 --> 34:21.260
Being pregnant wouldn't keep me
from going to school if I wanted to.

34:25.780 --> 34:27.699
Who's the father?

34:28.179 --> 34:30.060
Some guy I was seeing.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.900
Some guy? Does he know?

34:31.940 --> 34:34.340
Of course he knows, Dad.
He's married and got two kids

34:34.380 --> 34:35.860
and wants nothing to do with me.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.500
Oh, honey.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.020
Oh, honey.

34:40.060 --> 34:42.540
I'm not going to go through with it,
so there's nothing to be upset about.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.900
I mean, I wasn't even going
to tell you guys.

34:43.940 --> 34:46.860
There will be no abortion, Jane.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.900
No, Dad. You're not going
to tell me what to do, okay?

34:49.940 --> 34:53.100
It's my body and I'll do what I want with it.

34:58.140 --> 35:01.100
I'm sorry, you're right. I said it wrong.

35:01.620 --> 35:04.540
I wasn't trying to tell you what to do.
What I was...

35:07.060 --> 35:09.340
What I was trying to say is that

35:09.380 --> 35:11.980
a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

35:12.020 --> 35:14.180
for your mother and me.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.300
Would you really
want to have a grandchild?

35:18.340 --> 35:20.580
Even if I'm not married?

35:21.580 --> 35:22.900
Yes.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.700
A child is what's important. We would...

35:27.940 --> 35:31.340
We would love it
and cherish it completely. And we would...

35:32.060 --> 35:34.380
We would help you raise it.

35:36.340 --> 35:39.740
If it means that much to you,
I'll think about it.

35:48.260 --> 35:51.380
I'm going to have to start getting up
a little earlier, aren't I?

35:51.420 --> 35:53.020
Oh, my God.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.180
Well, we were right.

35:59.220 --> 36:00.900
She was hiding something.

36:00.940 --> 36:04.620
Pregnant's not all of it.
She's hiding something bigger.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.020
Something much bigger.

36:11.060 --> 36:13.380
- You think so?
- I know so.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.100
And so do you.

37:15.340 --> 37:18.540
It's darker tonight
than it was on your night.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.820
But still...

37:20.860 --> 37:24.260
How did you manage to not
bump into the furniture?

37:38.140 --> 37:41.060
Was the light on? Or did you turn it on?

37:41.100 --> 37:44.700
Because I know you,
and you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.

37:55.260 --> 37:56.340
Where have you been?

37:56.380 --> 37:57.300
Where have you been?

37:57.420 --> 38:00.140
Did you miss the thrill of killing?

38:08.380 --> 38:10.980
What if these are stuck closed

38:11.260 --> 38:13.820
because you yanked them closed?

38:15.660 --> 38:17.660
Which would mean...

38:20.260 --> 38:23.620
They were open
when you came into the room.

38:29.660 --> 38:32.340
Thank you. I appreciate your time.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.500
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

38:37.900 --> 38:41.100
I was just about to knock.
I'm Detective Atwood, Portland Police.

38:41.140 --> 38:44.020
- How are you doing this evening?
- Fine.

38:44.180 --> 38:47.140
You a photographer, Mr. Baffert?

38:47.300 --> 38:48.860
- No.
- No?

38:49.380 --> 38:53.780
Thank you. No, actually
it's kind of a hobby. I just started.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.820
Well, I don't know if you're aware,
but there was a murder.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.260
Yes, in the house across the way.

38:59.300 --> 39:04.380
Well, you didn't happen to see anything
unusual or suspicious that night, did you?

39:04.700 --> 39:09.380
No. No. I wondered
that when it happened, but no.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.540
I'm sorry.

39:11.660 --> 39:15.100
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody
and I don't want to be late.

39:15.140 --> 39:18.340
Well, here's my card,
if you do hear something.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.340
Remember anything.

39:21.180 --> 39:23.740
Yeah, I wish I could be more help, but...

39:23.780 --> 39:25.340
Sorry.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.660
He looks clean.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.300
Looks like he's alone.

39:44.340 --> 39:48.820
No, I'll tell you, he really wants to do this.

39:49.860 --> 39:53.180
Maybe I should pull over there
and pick him up.

39:53.620 --> 39:55.380
No, just honk.

39:55.780 --> 40:00.500
Maybe he'll get killed crossing the street
and save us the mess of doing it.

40:18.540 --> 40:20.180
Almost.

40:32.060 --> 40:34.180
It's coming down hard.

40:34.220 --> 40:35.980
They say it will be sunny tomorrow.

40:36.020 --> 40:38.660
I never trust those guys. They say
it's going to be clear and then it rains,

40:38.700 --> 40:41.980
and they say it's going to rain
and it's sunny.

40:43.140 --> 40:46.340
I believe this is what you asked for.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.620
The pictures
and the memory card, all here?

40:52.780 --> 40:54.020
Boom.

40:55.620 --> 41:00.140
You and I both know
that not all the pictures are in here.

41:00.340 --> 41:03.940
And you made a copy of the memory card,
isn't that so?

41:04.900 --> 41:07.420
But you understand my position.

41:08.820 --> 41:10.580
Yes, I do.

41:10.740 --> 41:12.740
But it's my hope that once you get to
know me better,

41:12.780 --> 41:17.380
you'll feel comfortable in giving me
everything that I have asked you for.

41:19.420 --> 41:21.060
Sounds fair.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.020
I thought you might be interested in this.

41:25.300 --> 41:28.460
This is the policewoman
who is looking for you.

41:29.100 --> 41:32.980
Wow. We've never known anyone
who was looking for us before.

41:33.660 --> 41:36.860
We're going to have to find out
everything there is to know about this

41:36.900 --> 41:38.460
woman.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.900
This is close, Marshall.

41:42.220 --> 41:44.340
This is too damn close.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.700
So, what's the plan?

41:50.860 --> 41:52.500
What do we...

41:52.540 --> 41:54.740
What are we doing here, tonight?

41:55.420 --> 41:58.380
We drive around until we see someone
we think we might

41:58.420 --> 42:00.140
enjoy killing.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.220
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

42:04.260 --> 42:06.380
You don't have somebody in mind?

42:06.420 --> 42:10.820
I don't enjoy this, Mr. Smith.
I do it because I'm addicted to it.

42:11.660 --> 42:14.820
And before you entered my life I vowed
that I would never kill again.

42:14.860 --> 42:17.740
So this is your party.

42:18.460 --> 42:22.860
You can choose anyone you want
and we'll do it together.

42:28.740 --> 42:31.300
Can it be somebody that I know?

42:37.020 --> 42:38.420
No.

42:39.020 --> 42:41.660
You never kill someone you know.

42:42.140 --> 42:44.580
It's the easiest way to get caught.

42:45.340 --> 42:46.380
Okay?

42:46.420 --> 42:47.780
Yeah.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.140
Buckle up.

42:54.580 --> 42:57.620
You look a little bit like that E.T. guy.

42:57.660 --> 42:59.780
Remember that movie
when he flies on the bike?

42:59.820 --> 43:02.220
- Yeah, yeah. I like that movie.
- Yeah.

44:01.820 --> 44:03.660
Jesus Christ.

44:07.780 --> 44:10.820
Fuck him! It's his fault. He's an asshole.

44:11.780 --> 44:13.340
Fuck you.

44:15.700 --> 44:19.980
Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill
the driver of the pickup.

44:23.700 --> 44:26.460
What about the driver of the pickup?

44:28.580 --> 44:30.580
What if we kill him?

44:32.340 --> 44:33.580
Yes.

44:33.620 --> 44:35.340
Yes! I've always wanted to
fucking kill somebody

44:35.380 --> 44:37.900
who fucked with me in traffic.

44:38.500 --> 44:42.660
Well, do you want to kill the driver of
the pickup or the owner?

44:44.940 --> 44:47.220
They may not be the same.

44:49.460 --> 44:51.180
The driver.

44:51.860 --> 44:52.980
Okay.

44:53.020 --> 44:56.420
We'll drive around until
we get a good look at him or her.

44:57.060 --> 44:59.780
Would it bother you to kill a woman?

45:00.140 --> 45:01.300
No.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.660
No, an asshole's an asshole.

45:10.940 --> 45:12.420
I wasn't in town that night.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.980
My roommate was.
Maybe he saw something.

45:14.020 --> 45:17.180
- Well, may I speak to him?
- He's on his way to Tokyo right now.

45:17.220 --> 45:19.420
He's also a flight attendant.

45:19.460 --> 45:23.100
Did the victims ever leave their
bedroom curtains open?

45:23.260 --> 45:24.460
All the time.

45:24.500 --> 45:26.340
I don't know if they thought we couldn't
see them doing it,

45:26.380 --> 45:29.860
if that's what you're asking,
or if they didn't care.

45:30.220 --> 45:32.340
Well, here's my card.
If you could have your roommate call me,

45:32.380 --> 45:34.980
and the people at this number know how
to reach me any time of day or night.

45:35.020 --> 45:36.780
I won't be here. But I'll leave him a note.

45:36.820 --> 45:39.060
- Okay, great. Thank you.
- Sure.

46:31.180 --> 46:34.780
Would you recognize him
if you saw his driver's license picture?

46:35.580 --> 46:36.980
Yeah.

46:38.300 --> 46:41.940
I've memorized the license number.
You write it down.

46:42.660 --> 46:44.180
I got it.

46:45.940 --> 46:47.340
Wow.

46:48.540 --> 46:50.900
Well, when you get home,
go on the Internet.

46:50.940 --> 46:53.940
Find out everything you can
about this guy.

46:54.180 --> 46:57.220
- We aren't going to kill him tonight?
- No.

46:57.740 --> 47:01.220
We could,
but then we wouldn't be in control.

47:01.260 --> 47:03.500
We could leave loose ends.

47:03.660 --> 47:06.420
And we both know the danger of that.

47:07.020 --> 47:08.700
Yeah, we do.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.860
What are you doing?

47:20.220 --> 47:21.820
What are you doing?

47:21.860 --> 47:23.420
Look at me.

47:23.460 --> 47:25.340
- Look at me.
- Why?

47:26.180 --> 47:27.700
Close your eyes.

47:27.740 --> 47:29.700
- Why?
- Close them.

47:31.460 --> 47:34.060
What's the license plate number?

47:37.740 --> 47:38.780
Shit!

47:38.820 --> 47:41.540
- P, 4...
- No.

47:43.060 --> 47:44.860
I know it's Oregon.

47:44.900 --> 47:46.700
Because of the tree?

47:47.900 --> 47:51.900
Don't feel bad. I've been doing this
a long time. Pen, paper.

47:51.940 --> 47:54.820
Look out the window and write it down.

47:55.620 --> 47:56.860
Okay.

47:57.020 --> 47:59.260
What was your first time like?

47:59.300 --> 48:03.180
You really don't want to know
that much about me, Mr. Smith.

48:18.940 --> 48:21.660
No, I think that was right.
Go back.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.540
Okay. We're in.

48:24.980 --> 48:27.740
For all the taxes we pay,
you'd think they'd make it more difficult

48:27.780 --> 48:31.140
to hack into the police personnel file.

48:32.740 --> 48:34.700
Her father's Gerald Atwood.

48:34.740 --> 48:37.220
Why does that ring a bell?

48:37.820 --> 48:39.940
- Someone you did business with?
- No.

48:39.980 --> 48:42.540
Someone we killed?

48:42.580 --> 48:44.820
No, not someone we killed.

48:44.940 --> 48:48.740
Let me see here.
MBA, College of William and Mary.

48:48.780 --> 48:50.860
She's been a cop for 12 years.

48:50.900 --> 48:53.780
Married Dr. Carlson, divorced Dr. Carlson,

48:53.820 --> 48:57.700
married a Jesse Vialo, restaurateur.

48:57.740 --> 49:02.100
Separates from Jesse Vialo,
sued for support by Jesse Vialo,

49:02.140 --> 49:06.420
seeing a shrink because of Jesse Vialo.

49:09.660 --> 49:11.740
She's caught a lot of people.

49:11.780 --> 49:13.580
And look here.

49:13.820 --> 49:17.340
This isn't the first time
she's been looking for us.

49:18.460 --> 49:20.060
Okay, here we are.

49:20.740 --> 49:21.940
Jesse Vialo.

49:21.980 --> 49:23.500
Good-Iooking,

49:24.140 --> 49:26.020
a little younger than she is.

49:26.060 --> 49:28.620
Younger, restaurateur...

49:29.940 --> 49:32.020
She married him on the rebound
from the doctor

49:32.060 --> 49:35.860
and I'll bet he married her
for her money and connections.

49:35.900 --> 49:39.660
Just because her old man's rich
doesn't mean she's rich.

49:40.420 --> 49:41.900
Maybe he's one of the kind of guys

49:41.940 --> 49:45.420
that would rather give it to the opera
than to his kids.

49:46.500 --> 49:50.460
Wouldn't she have to declare any
outside income and holdings?

50:01.100 --> 50:04.340
You are... You are a genius.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.980
The opera didn't get much.

50:08.860 --> 50:10.100
Hmm.

50:10.740 --> 50:15.340
Why would a woman worth
60-plus million dollars,

50:15.380 --> 50:17.740
and probably more to come

50:19.660 --> 50:21.460
want to be a cop?

50:21.900 --> 50:23.980
I like that about her.

50:25.460 --> 50:29.100
You are such a fucking snob, Earl.
You like her because she's rich.

50:29.140 --> 50:31.620
No, I like her because
she's found something that's hers.

50:31.660 --> 50:34.460
It's not the family business
and she's good at it.

50:34.500 --> 50:38.460
I'd like Jane to find something that's hers

50:38.540 --> 50:41.020
and that she could be good at.

50:44.020 --> 50:47.420
That's exactly why Atwood
scares the shit out of me.

50:47.460 --> 50:50.100
She's a cop who doesn't need the money

50:50.700 --> 50:52.500
and she's looking for us.

50:52.540 --> 50:55.060
That's one fucking dangerous
human being.

50:56.900 --> 51:01.340
The fact that you're not wrong does not
make me admire her any less.

51:02.140 --> 51:03.980
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hi, Tracy.

51:04.020 --> 51:05.740
Thank you for meeting me here.
I got you a latte.

51:05.780 --> 51:08.620
Thanks. Do you mind if we walk and talk
while I hear about your big idea?

51:08.660 --> 51:09.700
Sure.

51:09.740 --> 51:12.860
- You really want to settle this?
- lf I can.

51:13.780 --> 51:15.980
I'd like to use your father.

51:16.020 --> 51:18.660
No. My father does nothing for nothing.

51:18.700 --> 51:22.220
Tracy, I understand, but your father
has a lot of political muscle.

51:22.260 --> 51:25.180
Now, his pull won't make everything
go away, but it'll be a tremendous help.

51:25.220 --> 51:27.180
Absolutely not.

51:27.220 --> 51:29.620
You're right.
We could have done this all on the phone.

51:29.660 --> 51:31.620
If you're willing to play the game and
ride the desk for a year,

51:31.660 --> 51:33.660
I'm sure we can settle at 1.25, 1.5.

51:33.700 --> 51:35.060
I'm not sitting on a desk.

51:35.100 --> 51:38.620
Then the only other option is your father.
Or money.

51:40.820 --> 51:43.020
1.5, and that's it.

51:43.180 --> 51:45.700
Okay. I'll call them today.

51:46.540 --> 51:49.860
I just need to get this done
as soon as possible.

51:50.220 --> 51:52.860
That's what Jesse's counting on.

51:53.460 --> 51:56.180
I'll call you when I have something.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.900
Oh, Tracy!

51:59.300 --> 52:04.460
Your husband says there's a picture of him
holding some trophy that you still have?

52:04.500 --> 52:06.660
What picture? He has everything.

52:06.700 --> 52:11.940
He claims it's his favorite picture, and you
put it up where you store your suitcases.

52:12.060 --> 52:13.260
I'll look.

52:13.300 --> 52:15.300
I know. Petty.

52:15.860 --> 52:18.580
But you're going through a divorce.

52:18.820 --> 52:21.020
Thanks for the latte.

52:42.700 --> 52:45.620
I told you I was coming back to get you.

52:46.140 --> 52:49.620
I already found a place
where I'm going to hang you.

52:50.260 --> 52:51.900
But first...

52:52.860 --> 52:56.100
I'm going to watch her
have some fun with you.

52:57.780 --> 53:01.580
Then she's going to watch me
have some fun with you.

53:02.340 --> 53:04.340
You know the drill.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.340
Don't fucking move!

53:17.380 --> 53:19.020
Shoot me!

53:19.220 --> 53:21.780
Come on, shoot me, motherfucker!

54:00.200 --> 54:02.000
Five down.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.600
"Sleeper's demon."

54:04.960 --> 54:06.880
Sleeper's demon.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.600
Incubus.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.120
Maybe he went home with someone else.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.600
Can you still see his pickup?

54:17.640 --> 54:18.880
Mmm-hmm.

54:19.360 --> 54:24.280
This is not the kind of guy who leaves
his pickup in an unguarded lot overnight.

54:25.560 --> 54:26.720
How do you know that?

54:26.760 --> 54:29.880
Somebody didn't do
their homework last night.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.520
"Tom Sawyer's villain."

54:36.560 --> 54:38.640
Tom Sawyer's villain.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.040
Let me get it.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.120
- Injun Joe.
- Yeah.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.920
Where do we know that guy from?

55:04.880 --> 55:08.080
You really should pay more attention
to what you read, Earl.

55:08.120 --> 55:11.040
Well, that's what I have you for, Marshall.

55:11.080 --> 55:14.480
His picture was on the front page of
the papers a couple days ago

55:14.520 --> 55:18.880
because he escaped from jail.
He's the killer they call The Hangman.

55:20.080 --> 55:23.600
Remember that cop that you like?

55:23.680 --> 55:25.160
Atwood?

55:26.840 --> 55:28.520
Who's chasing us?

55:28.560 --> 55:31.080
She's the one who put him away.

55:32.600 --> 55:36.400
Well, well, well. What would life be

55:37.240 --> 55:39.200
without surprises?

55:39.320 --> 55:41.560
There he is. There he is!

55:45.320 --> 55:46.720
You know what's wild?

55:46.760 --> 55:51.520
This guy, I bet he's got all sorts of
plans for tonight, tomorrow night...

55:51.680 --> 55:54.440
He has no idea he'll already be dead.

55:55.080 --> 55:57.800
He won't be able to do any of them. Nope.

56:02.720 --> 56:05.600
I don't think I want to kill this guy.

56:06.480 --> 56:07.680
What?

56:07.720 --> 56:11.800
I love what you are thinking.

56:13.080 --> 56:16.640
You have no idea what I am thinking.

56:16.840 --> 56:20.680
Yes, I do, and it's wonderfully twisted.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.920
Wait a minute. You promised.

56:23.960 --> 56:26.120
I know I said we would,

56:26.920 --> 56:28.560
but I don't think it would be
that much fun.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.840
So that's it? Just no?

56:31.600 --> 56:32.880
Yes.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.600
I see.

56:37.560 --> 56:40.200
- Did you get the license plate?
- Yeah.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.920
We found the van
in an underground parking lot

56:42.960 --> 56:44.800
about two miles
from where they left you.

56:44.840 --> 56:46.680
It was stolen last night.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.840
We're checking security camera tapes.

56:48.880 --> 56:52.680
If Meeks and the woman left in a car,
we'll have a license plate number.

56:52.720 --> 56:54.480
These are the women we have pictures of
who know Meeks.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.240
None of the attendants
remember seeing them.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.040
What about that chiropractor,
Alvin Griffin?

56:59.080 --> 57:00.680
You know,
the one who sold Meeks the steroids.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.400
We've had a tap on his phone
ever since Meeks escaped.

57:03.440 --> 57:06.600
No contact there so far,
and he sure isn't going to talk to us.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.000
How about a warrant to search the house?

57:08.040 --> 57:09.760
You get me in the door
and he'll talk to me.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.040
How's your divorce going?

57:13.600 --> 57:16.880
I took your advice
and told my lawyer to settle.

57:17.120 --> 57:20.520
- None of these are the woman in the van.
- Whoa. Trying to suture up here.

57:20.560 --> 57:23.040
- Sorry.
- And your ego can handle that?

57:23.560 --> 57:25.880
No, but it doesn't like the other choices.

57:25.920 --> 57:30.440
Because the FBI is riding hard on me
to take over the Thumbprint Killer.

57:31.720 --> 57:34.920
Until Meeks is caught,
Hawkins is with you.

57:36.240 --> 57:39.760
Nothing personal, Hawkins,
but I don't think you'd take a bullet for me.

57:39.800 --> 57:42.760
I wouldn't take the bullet,
I might push you out of the way.

57:42.800 --> 57:45.720
I'll give you two days. Then I want
a progress report on your divorce.

57:45.760 --> 57:47.720
Look, I have all the pieces
for the Thumbprint Killer.

57:47.760 --> 57:50.680
I'm just not looking at it the right way.

57:50.720 --> 57:53.760
I'll keep the FBI out of it for three days.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.800
That is ugly.

58:03.240 --> 58:06.880
Mr. Smith wants you to notice
that he's pouting.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.800
Yes, I know.

58:28.840 --> 58:32.240
I know you're upset, Mr. Smith,
and I am sorry.

58:32.280 --> 58:34.480
Yeah. I'm upset.

58:38.240 --> 58:41.840
Maybe I was a little abrupt back there,
but let me explain.

58:41.880 --> 58:45.840
Finding someone
you think would be fun to kill is a bit like...

58:46.640 --> 58:48.360
Well, it's a bit like falling in love.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.240
You meet a lot of candidates, and
you like some of them and they're nice,

58:52.280 --> 58:54.080
but they're not right.

58:54.120 --> 58:58.560
And that special one comes along,
and your heart,

58:58.600 --> 59:03.360
it beats faster
and you know that's the one.

59:03.760 --> 59:07.880
The man in the pickup
did not make my heart beat faster.

59:08.400 --> 59:11.200
Okay, the man didn't
make your heart beat faster.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.800
Then who?

59:13.160 --> 59:15.520
I don't know, but I think...

59:17.320 --> 59:19.760
I think I have someone in mind.

59:20.200 --> 59:23.920
- Do you want me to do some work on it?
- No, let's just...

59:24.600 --> 59:27.120
Let's just see how it plays out.

59:28.360 --> 59:31.520
That's what I'm talking about.
That's my problem.

59:31.560 --> 59:34.160
That makes me feel
like I'm being jerked around!

59:34.200 --> 59:36.400
It was supposed to be last night
and then it was going to be tonight!

59:36.440 --> 59:39.000
And now it's, "Let's see how it plays out."

59:39.040 --> 59:43.200
I feel like you're...
I feel like you're backing out of our deal.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.760
- I don't like how that feels.
- I promise you.

59:45.800 --> 59:48.400
I promise you it will happen.

59:48.440 --> 59:49.920
When?

59:50.000 --> 59:53.760
When is it going to happen, Mr. Brooks?
When?

59:54.200 --> 59:57.040
Tomorrow night. Same time.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.120
When you come out of your building,
I want you to turn right.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.400
Go to the first street
that you can go west on.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.880
- I will pick you up on that street.
- Okay.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.280
I want to do this.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.080
But if it continues to drag out,
I could change my mind.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.600
Hmm.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.600
Don't you think I want to do this,
Mr. Smith?

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.520
Maybe you don't think
that you have to anymore.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.320
Even if that guy was charming and funny,
I still wouldn't like him.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.080
What can I do for you?

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.760
Detective Smolny,
Portland Police Department.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.800
This is Detective Carfagno.
She's from Palo Alto, California.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.080
Emma.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.960
Emma!

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.760
Did Jane ever tell you
that there was a murder at her school?

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.400
- No.
- Nothing?

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.640
Not that a friend died or
someone she knew died? Or some...

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.120
Somebody in her dorm died?

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.120
No. Why?

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.040
Well, there are two detectives downstairs.
One of them is from Palo Alto.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.040
They want to ask her some questions
about a murder

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.160
that occurred there
shortly before she came home.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.800
Gosh.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.720
Well, I'm sure if she was close
to somebody who was murdered

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.160
she would've said something.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.600
Yeah.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.840
I called Roger.
He suggested a criminal attorney.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.880
They'll be here within the hour.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.080
Yeah. I'll get dressed.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.160
- This is too close.
- I know!

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.720
Jane,
how well did you know Phillip Ramsey?

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.600
He and I were in a couple classes together,
but that's about it.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.520
- Did you ever drive him to class?
- No.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.400
You ever been to his apartment?
Do you know where he lives?

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.120
- Which complex was he in?
- What happened to your BMW, Jane?

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.920
It was actually stolen,
Sunday night or Monday morning.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.440
Detective, hold on a second.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.360
My understanding
is that she's not a suspect.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560
Well, that was interesting.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.440
- You know, I don't feel so well.
- I think you should lie down. Okay?

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.520
I think she should lie down.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.720
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't say anything before.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.720
It was really horrible,
but, I didn't know the guy that well and...

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.360
It happened around the same time
I found out I was pregnant,

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.080
- so it just kind of went out of my mind.
- I understand.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.360
I'm going to go up with her.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.440
God help me. What do I do?

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.640
She did it.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.200
Didn't she?

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.160
Yeah.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.760
It'll take the cops a week to 10 days
to put their case together and then...

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.600
And then they will come back
and arrest her.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.040
What are you going to do?

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.840
Oh, God.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.240
Oh, God! I've been afraid of this
since before she was born.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.560
She has...

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.240
She has what I have.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.440
Yes, she does.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.640
But you were always smart about it.
She was stupid.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.320
She did it because she got off on it.
Okay, I understand.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.520
She did it for fun. Okay, I understand.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:25.480
But why didn't she think it through?
A hatchet? And she left it there?

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.880
They were pretty graphic, weren't they?

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.040
That was to shock her
into making a mistake.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080
What does she think I think?

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.640
Didn't she remember what she told me,

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.360
that the BMW was being driven across
the country by a friend?

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.480
Now, right in front of me,
she tells the cops that it was stolen.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.800
You always cleaned up after her,
whatever she did, all her life.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.360
If the BMW
has anything incriminating in it,

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.280
I hope it was stolen.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.840
Or she dropped it
at the bottom of a very deep lake.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.760
Think she knows
how much trouble she's in?

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.400
I think...

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.800
I think she thought
she'd gotten away with it,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.120
until the cops showed up.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.600
I should have listened to her.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.920
She was trying to tell me. It was there.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.240
"I didn't quit school
because I was pregnant."

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.640
I should've dug deeper.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.680
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.240
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.800
It's not your fault, Earl.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.840
Part of your problem with her
is that you always think it is.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.880
She has what I have, Marshall.
So, on a very basic level, it is my fault!

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.280
What are you going to do?

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.240
Maybe the best thing for her
would be to let her go to jail.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.480
What about her child?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.280
Emma and I would help her raise it.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.840
You might be right, Earl. You know?
You just might be.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.880
Because if she's not stopped,
she's going to kill again,

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:29.439
and if she really wants
to take over the box business,

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.880
the next victim could be

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.120
you.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.359
I don't think she'd go that far.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.760
Hey.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.520
We received a counteroffer.
Are you sitting down?

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.200
- Yeah, go ahead.
- $5 million,

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.560
Oh, my God. You got to be kidding me.
He can't get that, can he?

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.120
No, no, no, my sense of it is
that by asking for five

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.920
they're hoping you settle
anywhere between 2.5 and 3.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.920
Shit. Can you stall them?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.880
Well,
they know you want this done quickly,

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.200
so they're going to expect
a quick counteroffer.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.080
Look, I need two days. Just wait two days.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.720
Tell them that it's a big number
and that I have to think about it.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.840
- Okay,
- Oh, and that picture that he wanted?

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.080
Tell him I couldn't find it.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.000
Yes, Mr. Brooks?

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.439
Mr. Brooks?

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.359
Mr. Brooks?

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.520
Before you open your mouth

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.080
be very sure this is the right thing to do.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.080
I will never be sure.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.040
You get pissed at me

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.880
because I'm always the one
arguing to go ahead and do murder.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.680
Not this time, Earl. This is your decision.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I know it's wrong.
I know in my heart it's wrong.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.480
Then don't do it.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.080
Go with Mr. Smith tonight and finish that

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.200
and let the police put Jane in jail.
Hopefully that will save her

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.880
and we can happily go on
with our tortured lives.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.280
That's exactly what I want to do.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.640
That's exactly what I should do.
The thing is, she is my daughter.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.120
And I love her.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.000
Mr. Brooks?

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.480
I'm going home.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.960
- Cancel everything for the rest of the day.
- I'll take care of it.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.040
If you need me, need me, Sunday,
I'll be at my studio.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.840
Call me there.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.960
I probably won't pick up,
so just leave a message.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.680
I'll try not to bother you.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.160
The thing that bothers me about this,

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.680
besides the fact
that we are not prepared and

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.600
a multitude of other things
is what does Mr. Smith do

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.120
when he's walking west tonight
and you don't show up?

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.840
That little freak could flip out.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.840
I will take care of it
on the way to the airport.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.400
What are we doing?

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.720
What are we doing? What are we doing?

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.400
You sound like a whiny-ass kid.
We're playing a hunch.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.800
We've been following this guy all day.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.600
He's boring, okay?

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.360
And everything we run on him
comes up clean.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.320
Well, if it didn't,
it wouldn't be called a hunch.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.920
Meeks, he's the guy
we should be looking for. Meeks.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.520
Look where? Please, tell me.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.160
Look, everyone knows who Meeks is
and is looking for him.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.440
The chiropractor was the last link
to his old life that I know.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.680
If we're going to find him now,
then somebody's going to turn him in,

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.200
or we're going to trip over him
at a bus stop.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.400
On the other hand, nobody knows who
the Thumbprint Killer is or where he is.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.200
However, I have a fucking hunch
that this guy, Baffert, does.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.520
I've got two days to play that hunch.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.200
So, if you think
you're wasting your time with me,

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.920
then I'd be happy to do it alone.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.680
I had a fight with my wife this morning.
What's your problem?

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.800
My husband wants $5 million.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.160
Here you are, sir. Sir?

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.600
Thank you.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.840
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things that I cannot change,

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.520
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.000
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.160
That's it for you, asshole!

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.760
Remember me?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.640
Can you step out of the car, please?
I want to talk to you.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.720
So, Mr. Baffert,
what is it that you have to tell me?

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.960
What do you mean?
I don't have anything to tell you.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.040
Really? Because I was driving around
and I suddenly got this feeling

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:08.120
that you had something to tell me
about the murders.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.040
No. Nothing.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.400
Well, that's disappointing,

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.760
because when I left,
after we talked last time,

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.760
I felt I had missed a clue
that was right in front of me

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.440
that could solve this whole case.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.560
I don't know why you would feel that.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.720
Didn't you tell me
that you were an amateur potter,

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.040
that you liked to make bowls and vases?

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:38.680
No, I told you that my hobby
was photography and not pottery.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.520
Well, maybe that was it.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.680
The flight attendant upstairs
said the victims

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.640
liked to keep their bedroom curtains open
when they had sex.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.920
Could I see some of those photos
you took of that couple?

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.520
You're harassing me, Detective Atwood.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.360
You knew very well that I'm not a potter,
and I don't have any pictures.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.040
So my feeling is your feeling is wrong,

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.240
and you should just move your car
and let me go home.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.480
What's your job here? What do you do?

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.440
I'm a mechanical engineer.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.920
Wow, you got to be really smart for that,
don't you?

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.400
I guess.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.280
Then be smart, Mr. Baffert.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.600
Because you lied to me,
right there at the end.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.240
I'll be watching you.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.320
When you want to tell me the truth,
you know how to get in touch with me.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.320
See you later, alligator.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.040
Captain Lister got us that search warrant
for Meeks' chiropractor.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.840
That's good.
God damn it, this guy knows something.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.120
He almost told me
and then something happened.

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.760
Think he did it?

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.240
I don't think it's quite that simple.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.360
You want to call for backup?

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.400
Yeah, we should be ready for anything.
In fact, get a canine unit and a chopper.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.680
I don't have the energy to chase this guy
if he decides to run.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.520
Mr, Alvin Griffin, you are surrounded,

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.280
Lay down on the floor
with your hands on top of your head,

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.400
Clear.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.120
Meeks was a steroid freak.
This was usually full.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.920
It's empty now.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.920
- You think Meeks has Alvin with him?
- He thinks Alvin turned him in.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.440
On me.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.280
Hawkins, meet Alvin Griffin.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.600
How do you feel?

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.200
Dirty.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.760
That's understandable.

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.200
You've never killed for this reason before.
The feeling will pass.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.120
I don't think so.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.800
That's the whole thing, Marshall.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.200
If I could find a way to just end it all,

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.040
disappear where there was
absolutely no trace of me,

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.680
because eventually
I will get caught doing this

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.800
and it will be very embarrassing for me
and Emma and Jane.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.840
So I've been thinking.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.040
Is there a way that Mr. Smith could kill me
and make me disappear?

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.880
Well, number one, Mr. Smith is not
smart enough to do that.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.680
- I know that.
- Number two,

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.440
there is no reason, if you're careful,
to believe you will ever get caught.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.920
I know that I will have to plan it
for Mr. Smith, but I think...

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.320
I think that's what I want to do.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.840
Well, I'm not particularly fond
of that plan, Earl.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.120
Remember, if you die, I go with you,
and I like being alive.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:56.320
I like eating. I like fucking. I like killing.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.240
I have to end it, Marshall.

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.160
One way or another.
And I think this is the best way.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.760
Fuck you, then!

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.440
Come on.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.280
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.920
- You worked all night?
- Yeah,

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.240
I had ideas for pots that took too long,
and the clay kept winning.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.160
It'll be fine.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:58.040
Oh, and there's this yellow Chinese glaze
that I'm trying to get right.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.040
Hey, Daddy.
Thought you'd be gone already.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.800
Roger called.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.560
There was another murder last night
at your school.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.840
Oh?

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.160
Yeah. Done the same way
as the one they talked to you about,

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.680
right down to the hatchet
being left at the scene.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.760
They think they have a serial killer.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:53.480
Obviously, you were here last night,
so you're in the clear.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:58.400
Wow, that's... That's good news, isn't it?
I mean...

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.920
Even if you're innocent,
it's good to know you're not a suspect.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.520
Oh, yeah.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.360
How's the...

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.560
How's the morning sickness?

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.640
Better than yesterday.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.920
You want to have lunch with me today?

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.600
I'd love to, but I don't know
how I'm going to feel later.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.960
Thank you.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.800
Do you love me, Jane?

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.040
Of course I love you, Daddy.
You're my father.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.640
Have you decided
whether or not to have the baby?

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.680
Not yet.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.040
Okay.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.720
It's time to go.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.240
"Dear Emma and Jane, my loves.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.800
"I have a terminal illness

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.560
"and instead of subjecting you
to my deterioration,

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.280
"I have decided to disappear.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.640
"Don't try to find me,
I don't want to be found,

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.800
"Please believe
that the time I spent with you

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.720
"brought me the greatest joy of my life,

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.360
"Love, Dad."

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.240
So you're going to go through with it?

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.360
It's all planned to work out.

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.200
- Ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith?
- Yeah.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.920
I smell gun oil.
Different gun oil than yours.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.640
He brought his gun.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.760
After he gets what he wants,
he plans to kill me.

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.840
Oh.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.640
Now I get it. You were counting on this.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.200
It has a certain logic.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.960
But if your plan was to have him kill you,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.680
why do you have to
kill somebody else first?

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.920
He'll need to see that
to get up the courage to kill me.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.480
Not even you believe that, Earl.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.880
It just makes it more exciting, doesn't it?

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.280
To think that he's going to kill you
after you kill somebody else.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.040
You're getting your rocks off, big time.
That's why you're doing this.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.960
Not true. And if it were, so what?

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.800
Hello? Yeah, put him through.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.520
I just got your message,

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.520
The weird thing is
that they closed their curtains.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.520
At first they were open,
like they always were,

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.080
and they were making love,
like they always did.

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.600
Then when I looked again,
the curtains were closed

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.680
and there were
what looked like camera flashes

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.240
coming from behind the curtains,

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.120
- Camera flashes?
- That's what it looked like,

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.400
That's why he poses them.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.160
- I'm sorry?
- No, no, nothing.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.000
Look, the guy you should talk to
is the guy on the floor below us.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.920
Would that be a Mr. Baffert?

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.640
Yeah. He told me once

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.880
that he had taken some great pictures
of that couple making love.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.480
He's the one you should talk to.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.880
Okay, great. Thank you.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.520
- Yeah,
- Hawkins?

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.720
Meet me at Baffert's apartment
with a search warrant.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.240
Put these on.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.000
Nice outfit.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.760
Try a couple of deep breaths
through your nose.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.480
- I have to take a crap so bad.
- What?

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.840
I have to take a crap.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.520
We won't be long.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.280
Crap.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.360
Called your wife's lawyer.
They're thinking about the $5 million.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.200
Realistically,
how much you think we can get?

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.160
Well, if we go to court,
best case scenario, two.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.200
I think we should hold firm for three.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.040
Let's not get piggish.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:41.120
2.5, 2.7 would still be a great deal.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.360
There's more if we want it.

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:54.640
We have to do this quickly. Remember?
Marie's meeting us here.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.480
Yes.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.600
- We could ask her to join us.
- It's not funny.

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.120
Are we alone?

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.640
Yeah.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.920
Hello.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.400
Do it.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.120
Do it.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.000
Don't do that.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.320
Mr. Baffert?

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.920
Mr. Baffert?

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.560
Yes!

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.320
Yes!

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.000
Yes! You are the fucking man.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:59.280
Oh, man, did you see the look on her face?
The look on her fucking face was great!

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.400
It was great. It was fantastic.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:06.400
That was everything
that I hoped it would be.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.400
Mr. Baffert? Knock-knock?

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.280
Anybody home?

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.680
Mr. Baffert?

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.360
Hello?

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.360
Obviously, Baffert's gone... Hey.

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.760
Obviously Baffert's gone.

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.440
God damn it, Hawkins.
Don't you ever knock?

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.240
I wasn't able to get the search warrant.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.120
Well, we might've just gotten lucky.
This is the moving company's work order,

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.040
and this looks like the address
where they're taking Baffert's stuff.

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.280
- Where were you when you called me?
- I was at home, in bed.

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:17.000
Can you prove that?

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:20.400
I was at home in bed.
Why do I need to prove that?

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.960
Your husband, Jesse,
and his lawyer were killed tonight.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.040
Get the fuck out.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.760
It looks like the Thumbprint Killer.

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:36.200
I've been ordered to bring you in
for questioning.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.320
Why?

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.680
I didn't want Jesse dead.

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.120
Look, I hated what he was doing to me,
but I didn't want him dead.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.760
Got it on the record,
said you wanted him dead.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.920
And who better
to fake a Thumbprint killing than you?

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.360
You don't actually believe I'd do that.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.160
If our jobs have taught us anything, Tracy,
it's that people do strange things.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.480
They just want to ask you some questions.

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:59.200
And I'm happy to answer their questions
after we go check out this address.

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.160
- I have to take you in.
- Look, this is the answer

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.080
to the Thumbprint Killer
and this is where I'm going.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.600
Don't make me cuff you,
because I will if I have to.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.040
It'd be really nice if you could go with me,

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:19.120
but if you do and this goes bad,
then they're going to burn your ass.

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.720
- So this never happened.
- You're nuts.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.200
Yeah, that's what they say.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.560
- Here comes the gun.
- Yep.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.520
What are you doing?

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:38.320
You're smart enough to figure that out,
Mr. Brooks.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.920
Well, we're going 65 miles an hour,
Mr. Smith.

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.640
If you shoot me now,
there's a good chance that we'll both die.

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.440
Not now. Take this next off-ramp.

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.640
You mean this one?

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.200
That wouldn't be very smart of me,
now would it?

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.040
Think about this, numb-nuts.
You pissed yourself back there.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.800
You left your DNA
at the scene of a double homicide

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.080
and there is nothing to indicate
that I was ever there.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.960
If the cops do an analysis of that urine,
and they will,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.560
you are the Thumbprint Killer.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.280
No. No.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.320
I have pictures of you
from the first murder.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:25.760
Yes, but what were you doing
at the second murder?

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.400
Hmm?

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.240
Let me help you with a thought.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.800
You say that I forced you to come along,
and if I'm not here,

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:39.560
more specifically,
my body is not here to say otherwise,

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.800
you might have a chance
at just beating the rap.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.440
You're probably asking yourself,
"Why would I help you?"

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:49.400
Well, I am tired, Mr. Smith.

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.840
I'm tired of killing, but I'm an addict.
I can't quit.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.680
I've tried, but I cannot do it on my own,
so I need you to kill me.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.880
But I need for you to do it smart,
all right?

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:03.800
In a way that I disappear
and my family never knows what I was.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.800
How? How do I fucking do that?

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.000
There's a cemetery I know about.

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:22.840
We find an open grave. You shoot me.
I fall into the grave.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.080
You shovel in just enough earth
to cover me.

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.360
Tomorrow, a casket is lowered onto me
and I've disappeared.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.720
It's a good plan, don't you think?

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.320
Why? Why should I trust you?

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.720
You don't have to trust me, Mr. Smith.
You're the man holding the gun.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.840
You saw me put mine in the trunk.
Remember?

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.880
I don't know.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.720
You really want me to kill you?

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.720
Yes.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.600
Okay. Okay.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:10.520
But one sudden move

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:16.360
and I drop you, and I make sure
that your family knows what you are.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.440
I understand.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.760
You've come down in the world,
Mr. Baffert.

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:49.360
Take your hand
out of your pocket real slow.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.480
You don't want to climb over, do you?

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.560
What are you doing
with the key to a cemetery?

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.120
I own it.

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:02.000
Why do you own a cemetery?

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:05.120
Well, you always want to invest in things
that people can't do without.

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.400
Water and cemeteries? Pretty safe bets.

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.960
Here, you'll need this to get out.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.520
Fuck!

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.280
Fuck!

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.880
Hey, Atwood!

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.240
I want to show you something.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.440
Okay.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.720
There we are.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.320
Okay.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:41.240
Now, if I stand here and you stand there...
Not...

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.920
Not too far away, and you shoot me,
I should...

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.040
I should fall straight back into this hole.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.080
You don't think I have the guts to do this,
do you?

01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.280
No, I'm hoping you do, Mr. Smith.
I'm hoping you do.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.080
Okay, let's...

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.160
Let's get this over with.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.600
I'll close my eyes.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.680
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.480
I really did want you to kill me.

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:58.840
But in case at the last minute
I changed my mind,

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:04.520
I returned to your apartment
and I bent the firing pin on your gun.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.440
In fact, I even brought another one
for you to use so you could finish me,

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.520
if I had decided to go through with it.

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.520
Unfortunately for you,
my daughter's pregnant.

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:22.080
And just before you pulled that trigger,

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.280
I realized how much
I want to see the end of that story.

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.280
Don't do this to me.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.520
If you touch even a hair on my head,
the cops are going to find those pictures.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.560
And they're going to know
that you killed that couple.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:38.240
The contents of your safety deposit box,
Mr. Smith,

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.320
have vanished.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.440
It hurts, doesn't it?

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:51.120
Help me!

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.840
Before I was the Thumbprint Killer,
Mr. Smith,

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.480
I killed a lot of people
in a lot of different ways.

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:51.520
Thank you.

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.400
It says there
that the Thumbprint Killer is a monster.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:13.240
Annoys you a little bit
you can't take credit, doesn't it?

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:18.160
No. Anyone who's good
at what they do wants credit,

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:24.960
but since I'm not going to do it anymore,
I will let Mr. Smith have the credit.

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.120
Don't kid yourself, Earl.
You're going to kill again.

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:31.200
No, I'm not.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.720
I'm going back to the AA meetings,
and I will control it.

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.680
But there is an answer
I would like to have.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.040
- Atwood.
- Why are you a cop?

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.520
Who is this?

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.520
You're rich. You have a good education.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.200
You could have gone
into your father's business.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:05.480
Instead you went outside all of that
and became successful on your own. Why?

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.040
If you want something from me,

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.920
then you're going to have to tell me
who you are or I'm going to hang up.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.840
Did you think your husband's killing
was random?

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.320
And I certainly didn't have to
give you Meeks,

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.120
Mr. Baffert?

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:22.400
- What's the answer?
- You don't sound like you.

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.720
Well, I have a little cold.

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.480
- Are you going to give me the answer?
- Where are you?

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.960
I'll tell you, if you can give me
the true answer to my question.

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.320
My father was very disappointed that
I was born a girl and he let me know it.

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.880
I've spent my whole life
trying to prove him wrong.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:58.160
Thank you.

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.800
Wait!
You promised to tell me where you are.

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.160
Me?

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:07.160
I'm on top of a building.

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.800
That wasn't Baffert.

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.680
Oh, Jane.

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.920
Jane.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.800
Jane!

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:44.400
Jane!

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.800
Earl, honey, wake up.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.200
Wake up.

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.200
You were dreaming.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:56.160
Oh, Emma. I was... I woke you up.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:59.560
It's okay. It's okay.

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.400
- Oh, God.
- I'm here. Go back to sleep.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.680
Why do you fight it so hard,
Earl?

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:17.040
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:21.360
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.120
Living one day at a time
and enjoying one moment at a time,

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.360
accepting hardships
as the pathway to peace.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.480
Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is and not as I would have it,

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.720
trusting that He will make all things
right if I surrender to His will,

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.240
that I may be reasonably happy in this life,

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:40.600
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. Amen.
