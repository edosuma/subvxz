00:30.313 --> 00:33.212
- On the
maiden voyage of the Titan 1-C

00:33.212 --> 00:36.560
the ship was struck by an
ice comet and destroyed.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.528
The lucky ones died quick.

00:38.528 --> 00:42.187
For the survivors, the
nightmare had only begun.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.686
Captain's log,

00:58.686 --> 01:00.377
New Year's Eve, 2140.

01:01.447 --> 01:03.691
Lewis McBride reporting.

01:03.691 --> 01:06.073
The maiden voyage
of the Titan 1-C

01:06.073 --> 01:08.075
is going as smooth as can be.

01:08.075 --> 01:11.319
This is a fine shot driven
by the latest technology

01:11.319 --> 01:13.839
and, of course, an
experienced crew.

01:13.839 --> 01:16.186
We're on schedule, heading
through the Nebula Zone

01:16.186 --> 01:19.258
in the cantankerous
region of Alpha 19.

01:19.258 --> 01:22.883
We are now preparing to land
on the dark side of Uranus,

01:22.883 --> 01:25.092
deploying exploration vehicle.

01:25.092 --> 01:25.920
Three,

01:25.920 --> 01:26.783
two,

01:26.783 --> 01:27.611
one.

01:28.543 --> 01:30.649
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:30.649 --> 01:32.927
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.732
Alien life form.

01:44.732 --> 01:46.630
Must take samples.

01:46.630 --> 01:47.873
Do, do, do, do.

01:53.051 --> 01:54.880
Tastes like Milky Way.

02:02.267 --> 02:05.718
- We have
encountered an issue.

02:05.718 --> 02:07.582
What is the problem?

02:07.582 --> 02:09.412
We have been invaded.

02:09.412 --> 02:12.484
They have come to
fuck all of our women.

02:12.484 --> 02:14.831
This serves as a huge issue.

02:16.246 --> 02:18.662
- Holy crap,
we're stuck in a sinkhole.

02:18.662 --> 02:19.732
- Ow.

02:22.149 --> 02:23.840
We must destroy you.

02:24.772 --> 02:25.946
- No!

02:25.946 --> 02:27.223
- Get off of our planet.

02:27.223 --> 02:28.293
- Help!

02:28.293 --> 02:29.328
- Disintegrate
the truck.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.297
We have conquered.

02:32.297 --> 02:33.677
- I'm back with guns.

02:33.677 --> 02:34.609
- No!

02:36.887 --> 02:38.337
Oh my gosh.

02:38.337 --> 02:39.718
- Wait, I
found something here

02:39.718 --> 02:41.168
we can use for a power source.

02:41.168 --> 02:43.964
- You can not
have our power source.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.586
- Captain McBride,

02:45.586 --> 02:47.691
aren't you forgetting something?

02:47.691 --> 02:48.520
- What?

02:48.520 --> 02:49.521
Oh, the meteor storm?

02:49.521 --> 02:51.695
Nah, that's way behind us.

02:51.695 --> 02:53.180
- But it's almost midnight.

02:53.180 --> 02:56.045
Don't you wanna wish the
passengers a happy new year?

02:56.045 --> 02:57.149
- Nah!

02:57.149 --> 02:57.978
Fuck 'em.

02:59.186 --> 03:02.258
- Isn't that First
Officer Vickers coming?

03:02.258 --> 03:03.086
- Shit!

03:03.086 --> 03:03.949
Hide!

03:07.332 --> 03:08.264
- Ten,

03:08.264 --> 03:09.092
nine,

03:09.092 --> 03:09.955
eight,

03:09.955 --> 03:10.818
seven,

03:10.818 --> 03:11.784
six,

03:11.784 --> 03:12.613
five,

03:12.613 --> 03:13.441
four,

03:13.441 --> 03:14.442
three,

03:14.442 --> 03:15.340
two,

03:15.340 --> 03:16.341
one!

03:16.341 --> 03:17.618
Happy New Year!

03:29.733 --> 03:31.425
- And happy new year
to all of you aboard

03:31.425 --> 03:33.979
the maiden voyage
of the Titan 1-C.

03:33.979 --> 03:36.533
Let's make 2140 a terrific year.

03:36.533 --> 03:40.192
My orders for all passengers
are to enjoy yourselves.

03:40.192 --> 03:42.436
This is Captain Lewis McBride,

03:42.436 --> 03:43.506
over and out.

03:45.301 --> 03:47.027
- Happy
New Year, Captain.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.097
- Same to you, Lana.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.339
Progress report.

03:49.339 --> 03:51.341
- If we stick to this course,

03:51.341 --> 03:54.034
we should be able to stay
clear of the meteor storm

03:54.034 --> 03:56.105
coming from the cortex region.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.071
- Excellent.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.383
Then I see no reason for you

03:58.383 --> 04:00.316
to stay on the bridge all night.

04:00.316 --> 04:01.558
Go enjoy yourself

04:01.558 --> 04:04.320
and ring in the
new year in style.

04:05.838 --> 04:10.015
- The only style I require
is a hot relaxing bath.

04:14.261 --> 04:17.022
Are you gonna be okay
all by yourself, Captain?

04:17.022 --> 04:19.817
- Who said I'm gonna
be all by myself?

04:19.817 --> 04:21.958
- Are you expecting company?

04:21.958 --> 04:25.824
- Do I have to order you to
leave the bridge, First Officer?

04:25.824 --> 04:27.239
- I can take a hint.

04:27.239 --> 04:28.654
- If it's attached
to a sledgehammer.

04:30.277 --> 04:32.762
- Have a good night, Captain.

04:32.762 --> 04:33.590
- Ah.

04:35.420 --> 04:36.904
Thought you'd never leave.

04:36.904 --> 04:38.078
Wow.

04:40.045 --> 04:41.288
- Hey guys!

04:41.288 --> 04:43.048
Are you having fun
on the Titan 1-C?

04:43.048 --> 04:45.947
We got babes, booze and party

04:45.947 --> 04:48.018
on the Titan 1-C.

04:48.018 --> 04:49.089
On the Titan!

04:49.089 --> 04:50.228
The Titan 1-C!

04:51.298 --> 04:54.024
- Zach, what's up, buddy?

04:54.024 --> 04:56.510
You got the thing
we talked about?

04:56.510 --> 04:58.374
♪ The place you wanna be

04:58.374 --> 05:03.310
♪ We have so much
fun on Titan 1-C ♪

05:05.312 --> 05:06.140
- More?

05:07.314 --> 05:08.901
Zach, don't take
all these at once.

05:08.901 --> 05:11.559
They're not really approved yet.

05:15.529 --> 05:16.564
So I can get into any--

05:17.910 --> 05:19.119
♪ Titan 1-C

05:19.119 --> 05:19.947
Bye, Zach.

05:20.844 --> 05:22.432

05:22.432 --> 05:23.537

warm in here, ladies.

05:37.861 --> 05:39.794
I think you're gonna
make it a little hotter.

05:39.794 --> 05:40.623
Yeah!

05:40.623 --> 05:41.727
Woo!

05:47.699 --> 05:48.527
Woo!

05:48.527 --> 05:49.632
Yeah, ladies!

05:49.632 --> 05:51.012
Put it down.

05:51.012 --> 05:53.153
Show the captain
what you can do.

05:57.295 --> 05:58.227
Oh yeah,

05:58.227 --> 05:59.573
I'd like to land on that planet.

05:59.573 --> 06:00.367
Oh.

06:02.472 --> 06:03.715
I need a drink.

06:06.062 --> 06:08.271
Oh, ladies, yeah.

06:08.271 --> 06:11.171
Show Captain McBride
what you got to hide.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.517
Show it to papa.

06:14.622 --> 06:15.520
Yeah!

06:15.520 --> 06:16.590
Woo!

06:16.590 --> 06:17.418
Good girls!

06:17.418 --> 06:18.419
Go, baby!

06:19.800 --> 06:21.146
Nice.

06:50.417 --> 06:51.866
- Where are we going?

06:51.866 --> 06:53.972
The party's not over.

06:53.972 --> 06:57.665
- You're right. It's
just the beginning.

06:57.665 --> 06:59.080
Follow the leader.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.013
- I thought I was the leader.

07:01.013 --> 07:02.567
- You think too much.

07:02.567 --> 07:03.809
- It's a curse.

07:03.809 --> 07:05.501
- I think it's cool.

07:05.501 --> 07:07.537
I wish I had super powers.

07:07.537 --> 07:09.919
- Your super powers are
located under your shirt.

07:09.919 --> 07:12.128
- Yeah, well don't
be expecting to see

07:12.128 --> 07:14.130
any of my super powers tonight.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.338
- That'll change

07:15.338 --> 07:17.961
once you have one
of these pink pills.

07:17.961 --> 07:19.446
- What are those?

07:19.446 --> 07:22.311
- New designer drug my dad's
company's been working on.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.519
Called Bliss.

07:23.519 --> 07:25.245
Believe me, they are.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.489
- They're designed to
get women into bed.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.181
- Does
it work on men too?

07:31.181 --> 07:32.666
- You'll find out.

08:02.074 --> 08:04.491
- You guys, I don't
like it down here.

08:04.491 --> 08:06.976
- This is the only place
we can party in private.

08:06.976 --> 08:08.495
If you know what I mean.

08:08.495 --> 08:09.806
- No cameras?

08:09.806 --> 08:11.221
- One in here is turned off.

08:11.221 --> 08:12.775
So we shouldn't be bothered.

08:12.775 --> 08:14.121
- It's creepy.

08:14.121 --> 08:17.227
Come on, can't we just
go back to the room?

08:17.227 --> 08:18.505
- What is that?

08:18.505 --> 08:19.609
- What is it?

08:19.609 --> 08:21.577
- It's a life pod, I think.

08:21.577 --> 08:22.819
- Like pod?

08:22.819 --> 08:24.234
- You know when you
take a sea cruise

08:24.234 --> 08:25.960
and there's a life boat?

08:25.960 --> 08:26.892
Same thing.

08:26.892 --> 08:28.756
- Is someone in a life pod?

08:28.756 --> 08:32.207
- Only in space,
no one can hear you moan.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.416
- I don't moan.

08:33.416 --> 08:34.866
- Try one.

08:34.866 --> 08:36.177
Let's find out.

08:36.177 --> 08:37.696
- What are you
all doing up here?

08:37.696 --> 08:39.491
This area is off limits.

08:39.491 --> 08:40.905
No one's allowed up here

08:40.905 --> 08:43.357
unless we're in an
extreme emergency.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.499
- Now that's what I call

08:47.499 --> 08:49.052
bringing in the new
year with a bang.

08:51.814 --> 08:53.540
- What do you call that?

08:53.540 --> 08:55.335
- That is huge.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.095
- I call that trouble!

08:57.095 --> 08:58.407
- I can explain. We were just--

08:58.407 --> 08:59.442
- Shut up!

09:01.375 --> 09:02.790
Everyone hang on.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.240
- Ladies, hang on to something!

09:04.240 --> 09:05.206
- Hang on to what?

09:05.206 --> 09:06.932
- Anything rock solid.

09:06.932 --> 09:08.762
- These aren't rock solid.

09:08.762 --> 09:11.178
These are natural and soft.

09:43.866 --> 09:46.869
- Oh my god what
the hell was that?

09:46.869 --> 09:48.422
- Is everyone okay?

09:49.837 --> 09:50.873
- Jesus.

09:52.115 --> 09:53.047
- Captain McBride,
Captain McBride,

09:53.047 --> 09:54.704
this is First Officer Vickers.

09:54.704 --> 09:55.878
Over.

09:55.878 --> 09:56.810
- Yes, but I'm a
little busy right now

09:56.810 --> 09:59.122
trying to dodge a meteor storm.

10:00.572 --> 10:01.401
Woo!

10:01.401 --> 10:02.747
I think we missed it.

10:05.853 --> 10:07.407
Oh my god!

10:07.407 --> 10:08.925
Ice comets dead ahead!

10:08.925 --> 10:10.133
Everyone brace for impact!

10:10.133 --> 10:11.963
Communication,
send out a mayday!

10:31.707 --> 10:33.571
- Captain, there's
something in these rocks.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.615
- Pressure leak!

10:43.615 --> 10:44.444
Abandon ship!

10:58.665 --> 10:59.700
- McBride! McBride!

10:59.700 --> 11:00.632
What happened?

11:00.632 --> 11:01.737
- The meteor exploded!

11:01.737 --> 11:02.910
The hull is breached!

11:02.910 --> 11:04.429
Evacuate the ship!

11:04.429 --> 11:07.294
Get as many people onto
the life pods as possible!

11:26.486 --> 11:27.935
Oh my god!

11:50.130 --> 11:51.683
- Red Alert!

11:51.683 --> 11:53.513
Oxygen in bridge

11:53.513 --> 11:56.170
Dropping to critical levels.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.724
Dropping.

11:57.724 --> 11:59.795
Oxygen in bridge

11:59.795 --> 12:01.175
zero percent.

12:01.175 --> 12:02.694
Red Alert!

12:02.694 --> 12:04.524
Oxygen level in bridge

12:04.524 --> 12:06.008
zero percent.

12:06.008 --> 12:07.630
Red Alert.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.287
Red Alert.

12:09.287 --> 12:11.254
Oxygen level in bridge

12:11.254 --> 12:12.842
zero percent.

12:16.674 --> 12:17.813
- What's going on?

12:17.813 --> 12:19.021
Get in the life pod!

12:19.021 --> 12:22.542
- I have to try and
save some of the others.

12:23.922 --> 12:25.199
- We've got people
coming down the hall.

12:25.199 --> 12:28.548
I'll try to redirect
them to another pod.

12:29.721 --> 12:30.929
- You get in the life pod!

12:30.929 --> 12:32.552
The captain goes
down with the ship.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.761
- You are not the captain.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.429
Come on!

12:48.429 --> 12:49.845
Hurry up! Over here!

12:51.640 --> 12:52.502
Come on!

12:52.502 --> 12:54.574
Let's go! Come on!

12:54.574 --> 12:55.436
Come on!

13:08.070 --> 13:09.105
- No!

13:42.518 --> 13:45.072
- The ship's going down faster
than a Malthusian hooker!

13:45.072 --> 13:45.901
- What?

13:45.901 --> 13:46.902
- Everyone strap in!

13:46.902 --> 13:47.868
- My parents are up there.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.042
I can't leave without them.

13:49.042 --> 13:50.319
- There is no up there anymore.

13:50.319 --> 13:52.562
We need to leave,
all of us, right now!

13:52.562 --> 13:53.391
- No!

13:53.391 --> 13:54.254
- Kenny, no!

13:55.496 --> 13:56.877
- Strap him in!

14:00.329 --> 14:01.502
Zach?

14:01.502 --> 14:02.711
Zach?

14:02.711 --> 14:05.714
What is this piece
of shit doing here?

14:06.887 --> 14:08.958
- My guess is that he
took all my Bliss pills

14:08.958 --> 14:11.443
and was rubbing one
out to these magazines.

14:11.443 --> 14:14.999
- And I suppose how you gained
access to the life pod bay.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.517
What a douche.

14:16.517 --> 14:19.866
But he may have just
saved your life.

14:21.937 --> 14:22.765
Hang on.

14:49.033 --> 14:49.861
- Look! Look!

14:49.861 --> 14:51.691
Somebody else made it!

14:55.246 --> 14:56.074
Nevermind.

14:57.593 --> 14:59.595
- I can't die like this!

15:00.665 --> 15:03.012
- All right, fuck it.

15:03.012 --> 15:04.289
- Hey, what're you doing?

15:04.289 --> 15:07.396
- If I'm going out, I'm
going out hard an happy.

15:07.396 --> 15:08.949
- Have these been tested?

15:08.949 --> 15:10.710
- Like that matters.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.676
- Don't worry.

15:11.676 --> 15:13.609
We are not going out like that.

15:13.609 --> 15:15.438
Not if I can help it.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.867
- Holy shit!

15:29.867 --> 15:31.489
Almost everyone I
love has been killed

15:31.489 --> 15:34.043
and I'm sporting the
biggest hard-on of my life.

15:34.043 --> 15:36.943
- What are these pills
you're popping on my ship?

15:36.943 --> 15:39.739
- They're called Bliss.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.362
- They're supposed to be
instant sex in a capsule.

15:42.362 --> 15:44.674
Kenny stole a bunch
from his father's lab.

15:44.674 --> 15:47.091
They've not been space
drug approved yet.

15:47.091 --> 15:49.438
- Zach took three and he's out.

15:51.129 --> 15:53.407
- No more taking
drugs on my watch.

15:53.407 --> 15:55.685
- Well, if this shop crashes,

15:55.685 --> 15:59.448
I can jimmy open the door
with my throbbing love tool.

15:59.448 --> 16:01.174
- Are you sure you don't
wanna take some of this?

16:01.174 --> 16:02.416
- I don't need to.

16:02.416 --> 16:04.625
I can feel what it's
doing to you guys.

16:04.625 --> 16:05.765
- Di's an empath.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.422
She can feel what others feel.

16:09.976 --> 16:11.460
- Are we gonna make it?

16:11.460 --> 16:12.495
- We're going somewhere.

16:12.495 --> 16:13.565
I can't tell you where

16:13.565 --> 16:14.566
but hang on!

16:18.329 --> 16:21.988
- My whole fucking family's
dead and I feel fucking great!

16:24.438 --> 16:27.648
- This is the best fucking
ship to hell I've ever been on!

16:30.651 --> 16:32.550
- We're gonna die!

16:35.001 --> 16:37.244
Oh my god! Oh my god!

16:37.244 --> 16:38.176
Oh my god!

17:00.371 --> 17:03.132
- Well, you guys have probably
crash landed right now

17:03.132 --> 17:05.340
on some distant alien planet.

17:05.340 --> 17:08.586
Just sit tight and hold
on to your rations.

17:08.586 --> 17:10.898
Now in the rations, I've looks
through them a little bit

17:10.898 --> 17:12.762
and there's some
really good peanuts

17:12.762 --> 17:14.799
and I'm sure there's
some mimosa mix in there.

17:14.799 --> 17:16.076
Have some fun.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.974
The party never stops.

17:17.974 --> 17:19.631
Even though you're
on a life pod,

17:19.631 --> 17:21.185
you guys could still party.

17:21.185 --> 17:22.117
- Hey.

17:22.117 --> 17:24.050
Is everyone okay back there?

17:24.050 --> 17:25.705
- You will be safe.

17:25.705 --> 17:28.261
- Wake up, we've landed.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.746
- Oh, gross.

17:30.746 --> 17:32.955
- I guess the pills
are still working.

17:32.955 --> 17:36.786
- Looks like your father's
Bliss is a success.

17:36.786 --> 17:37.822
- I'll say.

17:37.822 --> 17:39.272
- You guys.

17:39.272 --> 17:41.101
Come on, can we talk about
more important things?

17:41.101 --> 17:42.413
Like...

17:42.413 --> 17:44.242
Where the hell are we?

17:45.726 --> 17:46.866
- I see trees.

17:47.970 --> 17:50.870
- We seem to be
surrounded by foliage.

17:50.870 --> 17:51.698
- Earth?

17:51.698 --> 17:52.975
- No, not Earth.

17:52.975 --> 17:55.150
We went down in the
Nebulous region,

17:55.150 --> 17:58.636
which is billions and billions
of clicks away from Earth.

17:58.636 --> 18:01.018
This is an uncharted planet.

18:01.018 --> 18:02.467
The good news is,

18:02.467 --> 18:04.918
judging by the greenery,
there's probably an atmosphere

18:04.918 --> 18:07.645
with enough oxygen
for us to breathe.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.647
- Wait, I'm not going out there.

18:09.647 --> 18:10.890
- We don't have a choice.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.408
We only have enough
air to sustain us

18:12.408 --> 18:14.652
for the next five
to ten minutes.

18:14.652 --> 18:16.171
- But we don't know
what's out there.

18:16.171 --> 18:17.862
- And what about
getting back to Earth?

18:17.862 --> 18:19.312
I have a life there.

18:19.312 --> 18:21.141
- I turned on the homing beacon.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.695
I'm sure the rescue team
will be checking the area

18:23.695 --> 18:25.490
for a survival signal.

18:25.490 --> 18:27.044
- How long will that take?

18:27.044 --> 18:28.666
- I don't know, a few days?

18:28.666 --> 18:30.944
Look, I don't think
anyone else made it.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.878
We are incredibly
lucky to be alive.

18:33.878 --> 18:37.847
- I guess my little
indiscretion saved our lives.

18:37.847 --> 18:41.437
- No, it was Lana who
brought us down there.

18:41.437 --> 18:42.438
Thanks Lana.

18:43.301 --> 18:44.440
- That's right!

18:44.440 --> 18:46.028
You're a hero!

18:46.028 --> 18:48.858
Our stoic pilot that kept her
head, while the rest of us--

18:48.858 --> 18:50.101
- Zach?

18:50.101 --> 18:51.171
Zach?

18:51.171 --> 18:52.345
Zach, wake up!

18:53.311 --> 18:55.693
Come on, douche bag, wake up!

18:55.693 --> 18:56.936
- He's not waking up?

18:56.936 --> 18:58.351
- I'm not getting a pulse.

18:58.351 --> 18:59.593
- Is he dead?

18:59.593 --> 19:00.594
- He took three of those pills.

19:00.594 --> 19:01.837
You think he overdosed?

19:01.837 --> 19:03.183
- I didn't tell
him to take three.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.530
- All right, everyone,
out of the pod now!

19:26.241 --> 19:28.070
- It looks like Earth.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.486
- Looks can be deceiving.

19:30.486 --> 19:31.832
It's very quiet.

19:33.144 --> 19:34.628
Dead.

19:34.628 --> 19:36.803
- I think Zach's dead too.

19:38.184 --> 19:40.186
- I thought you said those
pills were safe, man?

19:40.186 --> 19:42.636
- Look, I took two
and I feel fine.

19:42.636 --> 19:44.155
- Really?

19:44.155 --> 19:45.053
Let me see.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.403
- What is she doing?

19:50.403 --> 19:51.991
- I told you, Di's an empath.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.682
She can sense what others feel,

19:53.682 --> 19:57.065
especially when through
physical contact.

20:08.593 --> 20:09.422
- Oh yeah.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.153
You pig!

20:16.153 --> 20:17.188
- Come on, Di.

20:17.188 --> 20:18.293
I'm just a man.

20:18.293 --> 20:19.535
- Is Kenny gonna be all right?

20:19.535 --> 20:21.779
- He's horny as hell.

20:21.779 --> 20:23.815
- I could've told you that.

20:23.815 --> 20:25.300
He's always that way.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.198
- Your pulse is racing.

20:27.198 --> 20:29.200
- But I'm gonna be
all right, right?

20:29.200 --> 20:32.410
- Well, you could
use some relief,

20:32.410 --> 20:34.999
but you're not
getting it from me.

20:34.999 --> 20:38.106
He's your boyfriend,
you deal with it.

20:38.106 --> 20:38.968
- What?

20:41.833 --> 20:43.249
Ew.

20:43.249 --> 20:44.077
No.

20:45.044 --> 20:45.906
Ugh.

20:47.563 --> 20:49.220
- He's dead.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.567
I think it was a heart attack.

20:54.432 --> 20:56.020
- Maybe he just had a bad heart.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.366
This is not my fault.

20:57.366 --> 20:58.954
You're not suppose
to take these things

20:58.954 --> 21:00.093
if you have a heart condition

21:00.093 --> 21:01.888
or high blood
pressure or diabetes.

21:01.888 --> 21:03.545
There's a long list.

21:05.167 --> 21:08.343
But I'm not the one that
ran us into a meteor storm.

21:08.343 --> 21:10.069
- Neither did I.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.417
All of the reports said that
we we far away from that storm.

21:13.417 --> 21:16.109
That wasn't a normal meteor.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.524
- Look,

21:17.524 --> 21:19.250
it's stupid to be
passing blame around now.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.356
We gotta deal with
the situation at hand.

21:21.356 --> 21:24.807
An untested sex pill is
the least of our concerns.

21:24.807 --> 21:26.395
- Tell that to Zach.

21:26.395 --> 21:27.879
- Well, that's pointless, Terri,

21:27.879 --> 21:29.812
because he's dead.

21:29.812 --> 21:31.745
Along with everyone
else on that ship.

21:31.745 --> 21:33.747
- We will be too if
we don't work together

21:33.747 --> 21:35.887
until they come rescue us.

21:35.887 --> 21:37.096
- He's right.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.098
The blonde guy is right.

21:40.513 --> 21:41.341
- Dirk.

21:42.756 --> 21:44.241
- Terri.

21:44.241 --> 21:45.207
- Ken.

21:45.207 --> 21:46.691
- Di.

21:46.691 --> 21:47.692
That's my name.

21:47.692 --> 21:49.349
It's short for Diamond.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.386
- Like diamond in the rough.

21:51.386 --> 21:53.698
Get it, diamond in the rough?

21:53.698 --> 21:55.390
Or diamond cutter.

21:55.390 --> 21:57.737
Which is what's between my legs.

21:57.737 --> 22:01.016
- So Kenny is the sex
obsessed funny guy

22:02.362 --> 22:04.985
and Dirk is the handsome,

22:04.985 --> 22:07.609
smartish leader of the group.

22:07.609 --> 22:11.130
And Terri is the
innocent, worried virgin.

22:13.408 --> 22:18.413
And Di is the resourceful tough
girl with special abilities.

22:20.622 --> 22:22.624
- What's your story?

22:22.624 --> 22:25.074
- Lana Vickers, first officer.

22:25.074 --> 22:28.147
And the new leader of
this gang of misfit toys,

22:28.147 --> 22:30.114
unless you have any objections.

22:30.114 --> 22:32.944
- That depends on what your
first order of business is.

22:32.944 --> 22:35.257
- Stick together,
stay near the pod.

22:35.257 --> 22:36.534
- I'm down with that.

22:36.534 --> 22:37.949
- In other words,

22:37.949 --> 22:41.160
behave like smart,
rational thinking adults.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.644
- Sounds like a plan.

22:42.644 --> 22:43.541
I'm all in.

22:44.508 --> 22:46.406
- Ken, you in?

22:46.406 --> 22:47.235
- In?

22:47.235 --> 22:49.409
- Do you wanna live?

22:49.409 --> 22:50.997
- Absolutely.

22:50.997 --> 22:54.034
- So no wandering off with
Terri and trying to get laid?

22:54.034 --> 22:56.175
- Can't I do both?

22:58.418 --> 23:00.109
- Okay, so we have cooking fuel.

23:00.109 --> 23:01.870
We have enough
rations for the week.

23:01.870 --> 23:04.907
And we'll be rescued
before the end of the week.

23:04.907 --> 23:08.532
And we have our UV
resistant survival clothes.

23:08.532 --> 23:10.050
And we have a flare gun,

23:10.050 --> 23:12.467
which we're gonna need that
to signal the rescue ship.

23:12.467 --> 23:13.709
Okay?

23:13.709 --> 23:14.952
So this is what I
want you guys to do.

23:14.952 --> 23:16.885
I want you to set up
bunks right over here.

23:26.515 --> 23:28.793
- You stupid mother fucker!

23:39.839 --> 23:40.667
- Well,

23:42.566 --> 23:44.188
well.

23:44.188 --> 23:46.846
It looks like we'll be
going to look for food

23:46.846 --> 23:50.712
now that our entire food
supply is destroyed.

23:54.302 --> 23:57.028
All right everyone,
let's head out.

23:57.028 --> 23:58.616
And stick together.

24:02.206 --> 24:03.518
- Wait, wait.

24:03.518 --> 24:05.382
What about Zach?

24:05.382 --> 24:07.418
- I don't think
he's going anywhere.

24:07.418 --> 24:10.628
- We'll bury him when it's dark.

25:56.631 --> 26:00.048
- So did anyone else
lose a loved one on board?

26:00.048 --> 26:02.153
- I tagged along
with Ken and his family.

26:02.153 --> 26:04.363
My parents still
live in New Detroit.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.226
- And how
did you two meet?

26:06.226 --> 26:07.400
- On the ship.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.437
I was supposed to come
with my boyfriend.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.197
- You didn't tell
me you had a boyfriend.

26:11.197 --> 26:12.405
- I don't.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.442
The son-of-a-bitch
was cheating on me.

26:14.442 --> 26:17.030
I found out while we
were in bed together.

26:17.030 --> 26:18.342
- He told you?

26:18.342 --> 26:19.861
- Of course not.

26:19.861 --> 26:22.484
But you can't keep secrets
like that from an empath.

26:22.484 --> 26:24.624
I dumped his ass but
I kept my ticket.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.488
No reason to let
the wandering dick

26:26.488 --> 26:29.077
ruin my first vaca
in three years.

26:29.077 --> 26:30.561
- Was your
ex on the ship?

26:30.561 --> 26:32.391
- God, I hope so.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.875
- What about you, Terri?

26:33.875 --> 26:36.464
- Kenny and I
have been dating for

26:36.464 --> 26:37.672
a year?

26:37.672 --> 26:39.225
- And you two still haven't--

26:39.225 --> 26:40.778
- That's what I'm saying.

26:40.778 --> 26:43.574
And you promised that
could change on this trip.

26:43.574 --> 26:45.231
- I told you.

26:45.231 --> 26:47.026
I'm just not ready yet.

26:47.026 --> 26:49.097
- Hence I brought the pills.

26:49.097 --> 26:51.444
- Get those things away from me.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.447
God, you've already killed
one person with them.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.311
- And you're fucking
killing me here.

26:56.311 --> 26:58.106
Bliss is fucking long-lasting

26:58.106 --> 26:59.970
and my blue balls
are turning purple.

26:59.970 --> 27:01.523
- You are disgusting.

27:01.523 --> 27:02.731
Okay, besides

27:02.731 --> 27:05.251
cruise ship disasters are such

27:06.148 --> 27:07.736
downers.

27:07.736 --> 27:08.565
Oh.

27:13.086 --> 27:13.915
- Christ.

27:15.088 --> 27:18.160
I gotta release
this jizz monster.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.403
- Keep up, Ken.

27:20.266 --> 27:21.370
- I'm coming.

27:22.302 --> 27:23.200
I'm coming.

27:25.651 --> 27:26.652
- Forget it.

27:31.657 --> 27:33.866
- Gotta rub one out.

27:33.866 --> 27:36.040
I'm gonna explode.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.463
Oh shit!

27:46.257 --> 27:47.604
You're still alive!

27:47.604 --> 27:49.329
We all thought you were dead.

27:49.329 --> 27:50.158
- Not

27:51.159 --> 27:52.678
dead.

27:52.678 --> 27:54.507
- No shit, not dead.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.026
That's great news.

27:57.234 --> 27:59.408
I knew these pills
couldn't kill anyone.

27:59.408 --> 28:00.617
Woo.

28:00.617 --> 28:03.827
Made you hornier than
hell though, right?

28:03.827 --> 28:06.139
- Hornier than hell.

28:07.244 --> 28:08.245
- I feel you.

28:08.245 --> 28:10.903
I was just about to...

28:10.903 --> 28:12.318
Nevermind.

28:12.318 --> 28:13.664
We gotta go find the others.

28:13.664 --> 28:15.804
Let them know that you're okay.

28:15.804 --> 28:17.634
Maybe Terri won't be so afraid

28:17.634 --> 28:20.084
to try one of these
little suckers

28:20.084 --> 28:22.777
and start sucking, if
you know what I mean.

28:22.777 --> 28:24.744
- One of these suckers.

28:24.744 --> 28:25.711
- No.

28:25.711 --> 28:28.679
I was talking about the pills.

28:28.679 --> 28:30.578
Aren't those the rocks
that crashed into our ship?

28:31.510 --> 28:32.338
- Listen.

28:33.719 --> 28:35.755
It's beautiful.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.931
- They're like sea
shells? Make sound?

28:43.038 --> 28:45.144
I don't hear anything.

28:46.973 --> 28:48.112
Wait.

28:48.112 --> 28:50.425
I can hear them cracking.

28:50.425 --> 28:52.531
That's kinda cool.

29:06.096 --> 29:08.719
- Hey, you guys,
Kenny's not keeping up.

29:08.719 --> 29:10.756
I think we should stop here
for awhile and wait for him.

29:14.587 --> 29:15.588
- Ken!

29:15.588 --> 29:17.038
Hey Ken, come on!

29:17.970 --> 29:19.903
Jesus Christ, what is he doing?

29:19.903 --> 29:21.663
- I know exactly
what he's doing.

29:21.663 --> 29:26.219
He's probably spanking the
monkey before he explodes.

29:26.219 --> 29:27.635
- Do you think he
needs some help?

29:27.635 --> 29:29.188
- He could probably
use and extra hand,

29:29.188 --> 29:30.154
if you know what I mean.

29:30.154 --> 29:31.397
- Didn't we already talk this?

29:31.397 --> 29:32.916
Sticking together?

29:32.916 --> 29:36.367
- Yeah but I still think I
should go and check on him.

29:36.367 --> 29:38.059
- It's going to be dark soon

29:38.059 --> 29:41.062
and I don't wanna be out here
wandering around when it is,

29:41.062 --> 29:42.960
so we should press on.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.513
- How about Terri
and I just go back?

29:44.513 --> 29:46.412
We'll get Ken, you
guys can find food.

29:46.412 --> 29:47.931
We'll meet you back at the pod.

29:47.931 --> 29:49.726
- That sounds like
splitting up, you know?

29:49.726 --> 29:51.382
Exactly what we said
we shouldn't do.

29:51.382 --> 29:53.488
- I said we shouldn't
wonder out alone.

29:53.488 --> 29:55.179
Groups of two are
still together.

29:55.179 --> 29:57.250
- Yeah but groups of four are
better than groups of two.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.494
- What is this? A math contest?

29:59.494 --> 30:02.462
Look, I'm not responsible
for stragglers,

30:02.462 --> 30:04.154
so do what you wanna do.

30:04.154 --> 30:05.914
It's your funeral.

30:05.914 --> 30:06.881
- We'll be okay.

30:06.881 --> 30:09.297
I'll see you back at the pod.

30:11.920 --> 30:12.749
- Wow.

30:14.371 --> 30:15.683
Come on.

30:17.029 --> 30:18.271
- Thanks
for coming with me.

30:18.271 --> 30:19.756
- Of course!

30:19.756 --> 30:21.481
I don't think any of us
should be out here alone.

30:21.481 --> 30:24.623
- That's why we can't
leave Kenny behind.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.072
- What do you see in him?

30:26.072 --> 30:27.695
If you don't mind me asking.

30:27.695 --> 30:28.557
- Kenny?

30:30.387 --> 30:32.182
I don't know.

30:32.182 --> 30:34.598
He's kind of sweet and funny,

30:36.531 --> 30:38.740
when he's not trying
to get in my pants.

30:38.740 --> 30:42.502
- And what percent of the
time is he not trying?

30:42.502 --> 30:44.194
- Five percent?

30:44.194 --> 30:45.954
- No, seriously.

30:45.954 --> 30:47.956
- Two percent?

30:47.956 --> 30:49.889
Maybe when he's asleep.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.684
- That's what I thought.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.100
And you obviously don't
want to have sex with him.

30:54.100 --> 30:55.757
- Wait, I never said that.

30:55.757 --> 30:57.656
- It's been a year.

30:57.656 --> 31:02.315
- I'm just waiting for the
right time, that's all.

31:02.315 --> 31:06.354
- After a year, there
is no right time.

31:09.184 --> 31:10.807
- Well what about you and Dirk?

31:10.807 --> 31:12.843
What do you see in him?

31:12.843 --> 31:13.672
- Money.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.502
And he's not bad to look at.

31:16.502 --> 31:17.952
Decent in bed.

31:17.952 --> 31:20.023
And he's not cheating on me.

31:20.023 --> 31:22.957
The not cheating
part is a big plus.

31:22.957 --> 31:27.237
- Okay, wait, didn't you guys
say you just met on the Titan?

31:27.237 --> 31:29.308
- Yeah, about a week ago.

31:30.205 --> 31:32.414
- And you've already done it?

31:32.414 --> 31:35.003
- Terri, sex can be just sex.

31:35.003 --> 31:37.454
Especially on the rebound.

31:37.454 --> 31:40.319
It doesn't have
to be a big thing.

31:40.319 --> 31:43.080
Not that I have an
issue with big things.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.704
Actually, the bigger the
better, in my opinion.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.258
- Hey, when you like,

31:48.258 --> 31:50.985
you know, do it with a guy.

31:50.985 --> 31:52.296
- Yeah?

31:52.296 --> 31:53.919
- Do you also feel
what he's feeling?

31:53.919 --> 31:54.885
- Yup.

31:54.885 --> 31:56.956
- Like while you're having?

31:56.956 --> 31:57.785
- Uh huh.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.028
Double the pleasure.

32:00.028 --> 32:01.547
It's one of the perks.

32:03.860 --> 32:05.344
- What was that?

32:05.344 --> 32:07.346
- Someone's been trailing us.

32:07.346 --> 32:09.141
- Do you think it's Kenny?

32:09.141 --> 32:10.211
- I don't know.

32:10.211 --> 32:11.902
It's hard to get
a clear feeling.

32:11.902 --> 32:12.731
- Kenny!

32:13.697 --> 32:14.940
Kenny!

32:14.940 --> 32:16.735
- Terri, wait!

32:16.735 --> 32:17.597
- Kenny!

32:19.599 --> 32:20.428
- Ken?

32:22.671 --> 32:24.018
- Kenny!

32:24.018 --> 32:25.744
- Terri, wait!

32:28.643 --> 32:29.471
- Kenny?

32:30.334 --> 32:32.198
Oh my god, Kenny!

32:32.198 --> 32:33.303
Kenny!

32:33.303 --> 32:35.374
Kenny, speak to me!

32:35.374 --> 32:36.202
Oh my god.

32:37.134 --> 32:39.033
They killed Kenny!

32:39.033 --> 32:39.999
- Hold on.

32:39.999 --> 32:40.897
Hold on.

32:40.897 --> 32:42.415
Terri, he's alive.

32:42.415 --> 32:44.314
But his heart is racing.

32:44.314 --> 32:46.040
- Because of the pills?

32:46.040 --> 32:48.387
- I don't know but we should
get him back to the life pod.

32:48.387 --> 32:50.872
I'm sure there's some kind of
first aid kit or something.

32:50.872 --> 32:52.563
- We have to tell the others.

32:52.563 --> 32:55.083
Maybe that officer
lady can help.

32:55.083 --> 32:55.981
- You're right.

32:55.981 --> 32:56.844
- Okay.

32:56.844 --> 32:57.810
You go get the others.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.294
I'm gonna stay here with Kenny.

32:59.294 --> 33:00.330
- Okay.

33:00.330 --> 33:01.607
Wait a minute.

33:01.607 --> 33:03.816
This looks like the
meteor off the ship.

33:05.266 --> 33:06.923
- They probably came
crashing down here

33:06.923 --> 33:09.339
when the ship exploded.

33:11.237 --> 33:12.445
What? What's wrong?

33:12.445 --> 33:13.999
- I felt something.

33:14.965 --> 33:17.381
I'm feeling completely alien.

33:19.763 --> 33:21.454
- From a rock?

33:21.454 --> 33:23.111
- I think there's
something inside the rock.

33:23.111 --> 33:25.527
Something that escaped.

33:25.527 --> 33:28.565
And Terri, I'm getting
really weird feelings.

33:28.565 --> 33:29.773
- You need to go!

33:29.773 --> 33:31.602
Go warn the others!

33:31.602 --> 33:32.603
- Okay.

33:32.603 --> 33:33.673
Okay.

33:33.673 --> 33:35.986
Don't move from this spot.

33:35.986 --> 33:37.091
Okay?

33:37.091 --> 33:38.368
I'll be right back.

33:38.368 --> 33:40.232
- Kenny, you're gonna be okay.

33:40.232 --> 33:41.474
- Lana!

33:41.474 --> 33:42.648
- You're gonna be
okay, I'm here.

33:42.648 --> 33:43.960
I'm gonna take
care of you, Kenny.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.409
Please stay with me.

33:52.416 --> 33:54.694
- I think we can eat these.

33:56.317 --> 33:58.837
They're not the most tasty
things in the universe,

33:58.837 --> 34:00.666
but at least it's
some basic sugar.

34:00.666 --> 34:02.150
- All right, well
let's hurry up.

34:02.150 --> 34:03.634
I don't wanna leave the
girls alone for too long.

34:03.634 --> 34:06.016
- Okay, we just
need to pick them.

34:06.016 --> 34:07.776
You really care about Di, huh.

34:07.776 --> 34:08.985
- Yeah.

34:08.985 --> 34:10.262
I mean, I've only
known her a week

34:10.262 --> 34:11.572
but there's a real
connection there.

34:11.572 --> 34:13.092
Let's hope she's not using me.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.300
- Using you?

34:14.300 --> 34:16.233
- Yeah, I mean, I
really care about her

34:16.233 --> 34:18.304
but does she feel the same way?

34:18.304 --> 34:19.927
I don't know.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.929
She can tell
everything that I feel

34:21.929 --> 34:23.757
but it's all one-sided.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.415
- That must be really strange

34:25.415 --> 34:27.969
not to be able to
hide you feelings.

34:27.969 --> 34:31.455
- So what happened
with the ship?

34:31.455 --> 34:34.148
Did the captain fuck up?

34:34.148 --> 34:35.080
- No.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.081
Captain McBride was excellent.

34:37.081 --> 34:40.395
He was the best star ship navigator
I have ever worked with.

34:40.395 --> 34:43.018
Look, we were clear
of that storm.

34:43.018 --> 34:45.538
I triple checked it
before we left the bridge.

34:45.538 --> 34:47.886
- Maybe he changed
course after you left.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.956
- No, I would've felt that.

34:49.956 --> 34:51.648
- You're psychic too?

34:51.648 --> 34:52.821
- No.

34:52.821 --> 34:54.650
I know my way
around the star ship

34:54.650 --> 34:57.033
and I have an excellent
sense of direction

34:57.033 --> 34:58.897
and so did the captain.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.865
Look, I know that
this sounds crazy,

35:03.522 --> 35:06.870
but I think that meteor
hit us on purpose.

35:06.870 --> 35:09.148
- Can meteors do that?

35:09.148 --> 35:10.667
- Not normal ones.

35:12.048 --> 35:14.257
When we get back
to the life pod,

35:14.257 --> 35:16.190
I want to examine those
fragments that hit us.

35:16.190 --> 35:18.399
Maybe something magnetized them

35:18.399 --> 35:19.952
and that's why they
were drawn to us.

35:19.952 --> 35:21.540
- Magnetic attraction?

35:21.540 --> 35:22.472
- Yeah.

35:22.472 --> 35:24.163
Like you and Di.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.751
Or Kenny and Terri.

35:26.614 --> 35:28.167
- What about you?

35:28.167 --> 35:29.410
- What?

35:29.410 --> 35:30.929
Do I have someone
special in my life?

35:30.929 --> 35:31.895
- Yeah.

35:31.895 --> 35:33.379
Were you and the captain?

35:34.553 --> 35:35.795
- Hell no.

35:35.795 --> 35:37.936
The captain and I
got along great.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.455
But he was a bit of a lady's man

35:40.455 --> 35:42.285
and I'm not that easy.

35:42.285 --> 35:43.113
Let's go.

35:44.080 --> 35:44.943
- Noted.

35:48.532 --> 35:49.361
- Kenny.

35:56.955 --> 36:00.234
You really do need a
release, don't you?

36:02.822 --> 36:03.651
Baby.

36:15.007 --> 36:17.527
Can a guy die from blue balls?

36:20.185 --> 36:21.531
Oh god, I can't.

36:23.153 --> 36:25.707
I can't do it, Kenny, I'm sorry.

36:25.707 --> 36:27.123
I'm sorry, I thought I could.

36:27.123 --> 36:28.572
I wanna help you.

36:30.609 --> 36:32.093
God, I just can't.

36:33.715 --> 36:35.959
- He's your boyfriend, Terri.

36:35.959 --> 36:37.616
Sex can be just sex.

36:39.342 --> 36:41.551
You deal with it.

36:41.551 --> 36:43.829
- Dirk took one of these

36:43.829 --> 36:46.659
and he didn't have
a bad reaction.

36:48.489 --> 36:50.042
My heart is strong.

36:52.424 --> 36:54.529
You better appreciate
what I'm doing for you

36:54.529 --> 36:56.428
when you wake up, Kenny.

37:11.891 --> 37:12.720
Okay.

37:15.067 --> 37:15.930
Now what?

37:26.975 --> 37:27.804
- Dirk?

37:30.048 --> 37:32.153
Lana, is that you?

37:35.432 --> 37:38.159
I know someone's
there! Come out!

37:41.749 --> 37:43.095
Oh my god, Zach!

37:43.095 --> 37:45.132
Holy shit, we thought
you were dead.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.616
- So I've heard.

37:46.616 --> 37:48.825
- I guess Vickers
doesn't know everything.

37:48.825 --> 37:50.102
Come on, we have
to find the others.

37:55.521 --> 37:56.350
What?

37:57.661 --> 38:00.664
- What is it? What's wrong?

38:00.664 --> 38:02.770
- You're not Zach.

38:02.770 --> 38:03.874
What are you?

38:05.324 --> 38:06.153
- Hungry.

38:17.095 --> 38:17.923
- Oh god.

38:19.718 --> 38:20.788
That's weird.

38:22.790 --> 38:24.378
It's getting darker

38:25.551 --> 38:28.658
but it feels like
it's getting hotter.

38:31.557 --> 38:33.145
Or is that just me?

38:34.767 --> 38:35.596
Wow.

38:37.908 --> 38:38.737
Oh.

38:40.428 --> 38:41.257
Oh, Kenny.

38:42.258 --> 38:45.364
I think the pills are working.

38:45.364 --> 38:46.193
Oh.

38:47.642 --> 38:49.748
My cha-cha is all tingly.

38:51.405 --> 38:52.233
Oh wow.

38:54.062 --> 38:54.891
Oh, Kenny.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.859
Oh.

38:57.859 --> 39:00.138
Oh, I see what you mean now.

39:02.450 --> 39:05.177
It's like fireworks
are going off

39:06.178 --> 39:07.524
in my love spot.

39:14.497 --> 39:16.015
I think I'm ready.

39:17.569 --> 39:19.157
I'm ready for love.

39:20.882 --> 39:21.711
Oh Kenny,

39:22.884 --> 39:25.611
I hope this makes
you feel better.

39:25.611 --> 39:28.718
Cause I know it's gonna
make me feel better.

39:32.411 --> 39:35.587
- This is some fucked up shit.

39:35.587 --> 39:37.140
Where are you?

39:37.140 --> 39:38.797
Where are you?

39:53.501 --> 39:54.882
- That's Di!

39:57.056 --> 39:58.334
- Dirk!

39:58.334 --> 39:59.231
Shit, Dirk!

40:01.854 --> 40:02.855
- Oh, Kenny.

40:04.512 --> 40:05.824
- Diamond!

40:05.824 --> 40:06.652
Di!

40:09.207 --> 40:10.829
- Oh, you are big.

40:10.829 --> 40:11.657
Oh.

40:12.658 --> 40:13.728
Oh fuck yeah.

40:16.593 --> 40:17.663
- Dirk?

40:17.663 --> 40:19.044
- Where are you?

40:19.044 --> 40:21.219
- Oh you big bad boy.

40:23.462 --> 40:25.153
Oh god.

40:25.153 --> 40:27.984
This is really happening Kenny.

40:30.262 --> 40:31.712
- Is someone out there?

40:31.712 --> 40:35.647
- Oh, one part of you
is definitely awake.

40:35.647 --> 40:37.304
Oh that's it!

40:37.304 --> 40:38.926
Oh wow!

40:38.926 --> 40:41.377
You give me all you got!

40:41.377 --> 40:42.861
- Who is that?

40:48.384 --> 40:49.730
Dirk!

40:49.730 --> 40:51.318
- Oh Kenny!

40:51.318 --> 40:53.251
Oh, it feels like...

40:56.875 --> 40:57.703
Oh Kenny.

40:59.567 --> 41:02.087
Oh god, it feels like...

41:02.087 --> 41:05.470
It feels like you're
getting even bigger.

41:16.239 --> 41:17.723
Oh.

41:17.723 --> 41:19.242
Oh god!

41:21.175 --> 41:22.728
Holy shit!

41:22.728 --> 41:25.766
I'm being punished by predator!

41:31.392 --> 41:33.118
- No! It's me!

41:33.118 --> 41:33.946
Don't.

41:35.948 --> 41:36.846
I love you.

41:38.019 --> 41:40.436
We're finally together
in that special way.

41:40.436 --> 41:42.265
- Oh, Kenny.

41:42.265 --> 41:43.749
Kenny, I love you.

41:44.992 --> 41:49.376
Oh god, these pills must
be messing with my head.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.756
Oh.

41:50.756 --> 41:52.413
Kenny, you are so...

41:53.587 --> 41:54.657
You are so...

41:57.487 --> 42:01.042
You're a fucking alien
with fucking alien cum!

42:29.899 --> 42:30.727
Wow.

42:31.970 --> 42:32.798
Oh.

42:36.802 --> 42:39.218
So that's what it feels like.

42:41.566 --> 42:42.498
- Terri!

42:42.498 --> 42:44.741
What the fuck are you doing?

42:47.330 --> 42:50.885
- I guess I got a
little carried away.

42:50.885 --> 42:53.060
First time and all.

42:53.060 --> 42:55.131
- You're a fucking black widow.

42:55.131 --> 42:56.339
- No!

42:56.339 --> 42:57.616
No, it wasn't Kenny.

42:57.616 --> 43:00.895
I mean it was Kenny
but then he transformed

43:00.895 --> 43:03.173
into something else, I swear.

43:03.173 --> 43:06.556
- Yeah, he transformed into
a dead body thanks to you.

43:06.556 --> 43:07.385
- No.

43:08.938 --> 43:10.353
It was raping me.

43:11.561 --> 43:13.080
- With you on top?

43:18.499 --> 43:21.088
- I was just trying
to relieve him.

43:21.088 --> 43:22.607
Like you said.

43:22.607 --> 43:24.540
- Okay guys, we need to hold on.

43:24.540 --> 43:26.956
There is something in the
woods that looks like Zach.

43:26.956 --> 43:28.406
- That's impossible.

43:28.406 --> 43:30.166
Zach is dead.

43:30.166 --> 43:32.202
- Well sthen something
is using his body

43:32.202 --> 43:36.517
because he attacked me
and turned into a monster.

43:36.517 --> 43:38.795
- A horny sex monster!

43:38.795 --> 43:40.935
- How do you think I got these?

43:40.935 --> 43:42.696
- I saw something too.

43:42.696 --> 43:43.800
It came after me.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.457
We're not alone on this planet.

43:45.457 --> 43:49.323
- It's like "Invasion
of the Booty Snatchers."

43:50.807 --> 43:52.740
- Okay, it's getting dark.

43:52.740 --> 43:55.640
We should get back
to the life pod.

44:02.647 --> 44:03.475
- Did you?

44:04.856 --> 44:05.753
- Just one.

44:06.582 --> 44:08.618
- Do they work?

44:08.618 --> 44:09.447
Oh, yep.

44:13.520 --> 44:17.455
It wasn't as romantic
as I had expected.

44:17.455 --> 44:18.835
- Poor kid.

44:18.835 --> 44:21.010
It's usually pretty painful

44:21.010 --> 44:22.943
the first time.

44:22.943 --> 44:23.771
Come on.

44:33.298 --> 44:34.161
- See?

44:34.161 --> 44:35.956
Zach's still here.

44:35.956 --> 44:37.509
- I wouldn't be so sure.

44:37.509 --> 44:38.372
Check it.

44:50.971 --> 44:54.906
- Now, exactly what did
you guys see out there?

44:57.322 --> 44:58.496
Come on.

44:58.496 --> 45:00.601
I need to know what
we're dealing with here.

45:00.601 --> 45:02.465
- It's not human.

45:02.465 --> 45:05.813
It can look human but it's not.

45:05.813 --> 45:07.781
- What does that mean?

45:07.781 --> 45:09.783
- I know what she means.

45:10.887 --> 45:13.752
It's like one
minute it was Kenny

45:13.752 --> 45:17.825
and then the next it was
this very large creature

45:20.276 --> 45:21.519
with a very large.

45:21.519 --> 45:23.451
- I saw the same thing.

45:23.451 --> 45:26.731
It was Zach and
then it wasn't Zach.

45:26.731 --> 45:28.836
- What if it is Zach?

45:28.836 --> 45:30.907
His body wasn't here
when we got back.

45:30.907 --> 45:33.082
- He's dead, I'm sure of it.

45:33.082 --> 45:35.394
- Then either something
dragged him away,

45:35.394 --> 45:36.810
or according to you two,

45:36.810 --> 45:38.328
got inside of him.

45:39.502 --> 45:41.780
- That wasn't a meteor
that hit the Titan.

45:41.780 --> 45:43.368
- Then what was it?

45:45.059 --> 45:46.060
- Parasites.

45:47.337 --> 45:50.409
Thousands and
thousands of parasites,

45:51.687 --> 45:55.104
bound together,
searching for a new home.

45:55.104 --> 45:58.521
The rock-like exterior was
just a protective shell

45:58.521 --> 46:01.869
for thousands of living
organisms inside.

46:03.353 --> 46:07.254
I have a feeling they've been
searching for a very long time

46:07.254 --> 46:09.083
for a suitable new host.

46:11.638 --> 46:13.985
- How the hell do you know that?

46:13.985 --> 46:16.056
- When I touched the meteor

46:16.056 --> 46:19.300
and that creature
that looks like Zach,

46:19.300 --> 46:20.543
I had a vision.

46:22.649 --> 46:24.512
- How very convenient.

46:25.755 --> 46:27.481
- Do you not believe me?

46:27.481 --> 46:28.931
- You said, yourself,

46:28.931 --> 46:30.449
that you thought that
meteor hit us on purpose.

46:30.449 --> 46:32.210
That it wasn't an accident.

46:32.210 --> 46:35.316
- Yeah, but I didn't say
anything about an alien attack.

46:35.316 --> 46:36.732
- There was something inside

46:36.732 --> 46:39.320
those pieces of
meteor that hit us.

46:39.320 --> 46:44.256
- And whatever it was hatched,
got inside Zach and Kenny,

46:44.256 --> 46:47.501
and is, was, using
them as host bodies.

46:48.744 --> 46:51.712
- Do you have any
better explanation?

46:51.712 --> 46:52.989
- No.

46:52.989 --> 46:54.577
But I have a question.

46:54.577 --> 46:57.097
- How did you get away
from the creature, Di?

46:57.097 --> 46:59.927
And I can ask you
the same thing.

46:59.927 --> 47:01.170
- What are you saying?

47:01.170 --> 47:02.965
If what you're saying is true,

47:02.965 --> 47:06.554
then this thing or things
can invade a host body

47:06.554 --> 47:09.488
and control them from
the inside, right?

47:09.488 --> 47:10.938
- Yes.

47:10.938 --> 47:14.666
- While continuing to look like
the people they've invaded.

47:14.666 --> 47:17.635
- I had no idea
that it wasn't Kenny

47:17.635 --> 47:20.499
until it changed
while I was on...

47:21.604 --> 47:22.432
Oh god.

47:23.882 --> 47:25.781
Oh, I feel so violated.

47:27.196 --> 47:30.613
- Then how do we know
that we all are still us?

47:33.409 --> 47:35.031
- What?

47:35.031 --> 47:38.552
- You say you escape
from the creature

47:38.552 --> 47:39.691
and so do you.

47:41.003 --> 47:42.004
And you say,

47:44.144 --> 47:46.767
it was Kenny who
was the creature

47:46.767 --> 47:48.769
and that's why you killed him.

47:48.769 --> 47:50.322
- That's right.

47:50.322 --> 47:53.360
- How do I know that you
all are telling the truth?

47:53.360 --> 47:56.121
What if you didn't escape?

47:56.121 --> 47:57.985
We were all separated out there

47:57.985 --> 48:01.920
and no one can back up
anyone's story, can they?

48:04.336 --> 48:06.235
- Wait, Di can tell us.

48:07.408 --> 48:09.825
She can touch each of
us and use her power

48:09.825 --> 48:12.206
to say whether or not we
are who we say we are.

48:12.206 --> 48:13.863
- And what if Di is infected?

48:13.863 --> 48:16.245
She'll say anything
the alien inside of her

48:16.245 --> 48:17.695
wants her to say.

48:17.695 --> 48:21.560
Maybe she doesn't even know
she's being controlled,

48:21.560 --> 48:22.561
manipulated,

48:23.804 --> 48:25.323
and I can't trust that.

48:25.323 --> 48:28.464
- Hey, if you and Dirk
got separated as well,

48:28.464 --> 48:30.984
no one can account for
you either, Vickers.

48:30.984 --> 48:33.538
How do we know the
creature didn't get to you?

48:33.538 --> 48:35.022
- You don't.

48:35.022 --> 48:36.610
- Di's the one who told
us all about the creatures

48:36.610 --> 48:37.645
and their motives.

48:37.645 --> 48:38.992
Why would she do that

48:38.992 --> 48:41.408
if she was infected
and trying to hide?

48:41.408 --> 48:44.238
- So we wouldn't
trust one another.

48:44.238 --> 48:46.206
- You're the one who
went down that road.

48:46.206 --> 48:47.448
Not me.

48:47.448 --> 48:49.243
- You know what, I'll admit it.

48:49.243 --> 48:51.245
I barley know any of you.

48:51.245 --> 48:53.040
But from what Dirk says,

48:53.040 --> 48:55.698
he doesn't know
much more about you.

48:55.698 --> 48:59.633
You guys had a whirlwind
ship board romance.

48:59.633 --> 49:02.809
- Yeah, but they
have already had sex.

49:02.809 --> 49:04.569
- Don't help, Terri.

49:04.569 --> 49:09.574
So, I sense you two got rather
friendly while I was away.

49:10.748 --> 49:12.128
What else did you
tell her, Dirk?

49:12.128 --> 49:13.095
- Nothing.

49:13.095 --> 49:14.821
We were just talking.

49:14.821 --> 49:15.925
Idle chatter.

49:17.099 --> 49:18.997
- He doesn't like being used.

49:18.997 --> 49:20.171
- Really?

49:20.171 --> 49:22.207
You think I'm using you?

49:22.207 --> 49:24.313
- Well, aren't you?

49:24.313 --> 49:25.970
I mean, from what
you've told me.

49:25.970 --> 49:29.525
- Guys, I think we're getting
a little off topic here.

49:29.525 --> 49:32.839
Deadly aliens trying to take
over our bodies, remember?

49:32.839 --> 49:35.220
- If you don't like where
this relationship is going,

49:35.220 --> 49:37.222
we can end it
right here and now.

49:37.222 --> 49:39.638
- If you guys do
end up breaking up,

49:39.638 --> 49:41.779
would you mind if
I took a a shot?

49:41.779 --> 49:45.541
Dirk is pretty cute and
from what you've told me.

49:45.541 --> 49:46.853
- What the fuck?

49:48.268 --> 49:51.133
Does everyone want to have
sex with my boyfriend?

49:51.133 --> 49:52.617
- I'm sorry.

49:52.617 --> 49:56.655
I think I'm still aroused
from that pill I took earlier.

50:00.073 --> 50:02.592
It's like my chest is on fire.

50:03.490 --> 50:05.699
It's just so sensitive.

50:05.699 --> 50:07.287
- You know what, Dirk?

50:07.287 --> 50:11.360
You can do what ever
and whoever you want.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.086
- Di, baby, come back.

50:13.086 --> 50:14.673
Come on, you know you're
the only one I want.

50:14.673 --> 50:17.642
You know that, you
know everything.

50:17.642 --> 50:18.574
- You guys.

50:19.782 --> 50:22.026
I think I just felt a lump.

50:25.719 --> 50:27.272
This is not normal.

50:28.170 --> 50:30.241
- Are you all right?

50:30.241 --> 50:33.451
- I don't know, do my
breasts look bigger to you?

50:35.729 --> 50:36.557
Oh god!

50:37.973 --> 50:40.078
Is this normal after sex?

50:41.839 --> 50:43.357
Oh god!

51:01.272 --> 51:04.171
- Get in the pod, quickly!

51:04.171 --> 51:05.310
- What the fuck?

51:05.310 --> 51:06.173
- Did you see that?

51:06.173 --> 51:07.416
- I did, we all did.

51:07.416 --> 51:10.143
- It used Terri's boobs
as a breading ground.

51:10.143 --> 51:11.420
She was about to give birth

51:11.420 --> 51:13.042
to more of those things.

51:37.895 --> 51:38.723
- Kill me!

51:40.138 --> 51:44.660
Please, before more of the
worm gets into my brain.

51:53.841 --> 51:54.670
Kill me!

52:13.931 --> 52:15.104
- Are we safe in here?

52:15.104 --> 52:16.795
- Safer than out there.

52:16.795 --> 52:18.797
- Unless one of us
is infected, right?

52:18.797 --> 52:20.385
- Could you just
cut that shit, okay?

52:20.385 --> 52:23.043
We've got a real threat out
there we gotta deal with.

52:23.043 --> 52:25.183
- I have an idea.

52:25.183 --> 52:26.495
- That's what we need
right now, ideas.

52:26.495 --> 52:27.427
Good ideas!

52:29.912 --> 52:31.638
- It's worth a try.

52:34.227 --> 52:35.883
- Are you trying to lift off?

52:35.883 --> 52:37.264
- Yes and no.

52:41.234 --> 52:43.822
- Whatever you're doing,
it's not doing any good!

52:43.822 --> 52:44.892
Stop it!

52:46.411 --> 52:50.312
- No, but it's driving
the creature away.

52:55.973 --> 52:57.560
I just saw it run off.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.252
- That's what I was
hoping would happen.

52:59.252 --> 53:02.393
- And it's popping all
the worms to pieces too.

53:12.368 --> 53:13.749
Your plan worked.

53:13.749 --> 53:14.715
- For now.

53:14.715 --> 53:16.510
But that monster will be back.

53:16.510 --> 53:18.616
- Before it does, we better
figure out a way to do it.

53:19.686 --> 53:20.514
- What!

53:20.514 --> 53:21.446
Whoa!

53:21.446 --> 53:22.378
- No, don't hurt it!

53:22.378 --> 53:23.828
- What are you doing?

53:23.828 --> 53:26.003
- If I touch it, maybe I
could feel what makes it tick.

53:26.003 --> 53:27.211
- She's right.

53:27.211 --> 53:28.729
It might help us find a
way to beat its daddy.

53:28.729 --> 53:29.903
- We can dissect it.

53:29.903 --> 53:31.077
- No!

53:31.077 --> 53:32.630
I can learn more
if its still alive.

53:33.941 --> 53:35.012
- I'm gonna let it go.

53:35.012 --> 53:35.874
- Okay.

53:37.290 --> 53:40.155
- Just keep that
sucker away from me.

53:40.155 --> 53:41.708
- Sorry, little guy.

53:41.708 --> 53:43.434
I just need to
feel what you know.

53:43.434 --> 53:46.126
- Just stop talking to it like
a pet cat and get on with it!

53:50.924 --> 53:52.408
- Okay, it's okay.

53:55.756 --> 53:57.241
Pain!

53:57.241 --> 53:58.276
Pain!

53:58.276 --> 53:59.381
- Let's kill this experiment.

53:59.381 --> 54:01.038
- No, wait!

54:01.038 --> 54:01.866
- Hold on.

54:04.593 --> 54:05.421
I see.

54:06.560 --> 54:07.389
I see.

54:10.599 --> 54:12.911
It's hard to put into words.

54:14.430 --> 54:17.157
These creatures
are like a virus.

54:18.331 --> 54:21.817
An organism living
on the edge of life.

54:21.817 --> 54:22.990
But not alive.

54:24.302 --> 54:26.339
A biological seed

54:26.339 --> 54:30.101
that seeks out,
infects and replicates

54:30.101 --> 54:32.034
inside a host organism.

54:32.034 --> 54:36.073
They resided in the rock
remains of their planet,

54:36.073 --> 54:39.628
which was destroyed
by a supernova

54:39.628 --> 54:40.456
ages ago.

54:41.492 --> 54:43.563
Pushed on by solar winds,

54:43.563 --> 54:46.221
the search for a host to infect

54:46.221 --> 54:49.672
in the empty, sterile wilderness

54:49.672 --> 54:51.571
of endless time

54:51.571 --> 54:53.124
in deep space.

54:56.093 --> 54:57.577
A leader,

54:57.577 --> 54:58.405
a brain.

54:59.268 --> 55:01.753
There is an intelligence,

55:01.753 --> 55:06.241
one part of a whole that
directs the attack on the host.

55:12.143 --> 55:16.113
The virus releases an attack
on the ship Titan 1-C.

55:16.113 --> 55:18.356
The infectious agent
mistakes the ship

55:18.356 --> 55:19.978
for a living organism

55:19.978 --> 55:23.258
and views us as cells
of that organism.

55:23.258 --> 55:25.260
Cells with genetic material

55:25.260 --> 55:29.678
that can be converted to its
own evil means to survive.

55:29.678 --> 55:33.785
To survive through behavioral
manipulation of other species.

55:33.785 --> 55:37.962
To survive by destroying
entire races of species.

55:37.962 --> 55:39.929
The intelligent brain!

55:39.929 --> 55:42.760
The central nervous
system of the hive,

55:42.760 --> 55:44.141
the leader!

55:44.141 --> 55:45.280
It's here!

55:45.280 --> 55:47.385
On the planet with us!

55:47.385 --> 55:49.939
Jumping from host
to host at will.

55:49.939 --> 55:52.735
We only have once chance.

55:52.735 --> 55:53.667
One chance.

55:54.634 --> 55:55.876
Kill the brain!

55:57.084 --> 55:58.569
It'll kill us all!

56:02.055 --> 56:03.850
- A virus can be that complex?

56:03.850 --> 56:05.023
That big?

56:05.023 --> 56:06.473
- The vast majority
of the biomass

56:06.473 --> 56:08.510
of life on Earth are viruses.

56:08.510 --> 56:10.546
- And it can manipulate
people at will?

56:10.546 --> 56:11.789
- There are fungi in the Amazon

56:11.789 --> 56:13.929
that can control
leaf cutter ants.

56:13.929 --> 56:15.965
Viruses that control mice.

56:15.965 --> 56:17.553
It's not unheard of.

56:17.553 --> 56:19.176
- You said there
was an intelligence.

56:19.176 --> 56:20.694
Can we communicate with it?

56:20.694 --> 56:23.007
- I don't think it wants to
hear anything we have to say.

56:23.007 --> 56:25.665
- I'm more interested
in killing it.

56:25.665 --> 56:28.185
So if we can find its brain,

56:28.185 --> 56:31.188
can we cut off the
head to kill the tail?

56:31.188 --> 56:32.672
- I believe so.

56:32.672 --> 56:34.915
But it won't be easy.

56:34.915 --> 56:37.159
- Let's search the pod
and make sure that no more

56:37.159 --> 56:40.921
of those alien worms
got on board, okay?

56:40.921 --> 56:43.890
- Di, don't worry,
everything will be all right.

56:43.890 --> 56:45.788
I'm sure they've got a
rescue squad on the way.

56:45.788 --> 56:48.032
There will be a party here
any minute to rescue us.

56:50.034 --> 56:50.862
What?

56:50.862 --> 56:51.932
What is it?

56:51.932 --> 56:53.624
- What's wrong?

56:53.624 --> 56:55.212
- You're not Dirk.

56:55.212 --> 56:56.178
- What're you?

56:56.178 --> 56:57.904
- You're one of those things!

56:57.904 --> 56:58.801
- What're you talking about?

56:58.801 --> 56:59.871
It's me, it's Dirk!

56:59.871 --> 57:01.839
- No, when you touched me I saw.

57:01.839 --> 57:04.117
- She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

57:04.117 --> 57:06.671
Di, you've still got that
alien worm goo in your hand.

57:06.671 --> 57:07.845
You're sensing them, not me.

57:07.845 --> 57:09.502
- Stay away from me.

57:10.675 --> 57:12.746
- I'm not one of those monsters.

57:12.746 --> 57:14.955
It chased me in the
woods but I escaped.

57:14.955 --> 57:15.887
- How?

57:15.887 --> 57:17.579
- I don't know, I outran it.

57:17.579 --> 57:19.028
Then I heard Terri screaming

57:19.028 --> 57:20.271
and I ran off in that direction

57:20.271 --> 57:21.824
where I found both of you.

57:21.824 --> 57:23.481
- If we let it stay
in here with us,

57:23.481 --> 57:25.380
it'll impregnate us both.

57:25.380 --> 57:26.967
Just like with Terri.

57:26.967 --> 57:28.693
- Believe me, after
what I've seen tonight,

57:28.693 --> 57:30.523
I never wanna have
sex ever again.

57:30.523 --> 57:32.594
So you can both relax, okay?

57:32.594 --> 57:34.561
- You have to believe me.

57:34.561 --> 57:36.563
He's one of those things.

57:36.563 --> 57:40.464
- I'm gonna need a little more
proof than just your say so.

57:40.464 --> 57:42.742
And personally, I'm a
little bit skeptical

57:42.742 --> 57:44.606
of the whole psychic
ability thing.

57:44.606 --> 57:46.884
- Di, I believe
in your abilities

57:46.884 --> 57:49.956
but you've been wrong before,
you told me so yourself.

57:49.956 --> 57:51.889
Just touch me again
and you'll see

57:51.889 --> 57:53.408
that I'm not one
of those creatures.

57:53.408 --> 57:54.926
- Don't try to trick us!

57:54.926 --> 57:57.239
- Both of you, sit down and
strap yourselves in the seats!

57:57.239 --> 57:59.034
- No way, what if
you're a creature?

57:59.034 --> 58:01.105
- If two of us were infected,
it would make it easy

58:01.105 --> 58:02.865
for us to overpower the third,

58:02.865 --> 58:04.833
which makes me think
at least two of us

58:04.833 --> 58:06.973
are exactly who we say we are.

58:06.973 --> 58:07.974
- Three of us.

58:07.974 --> 58:09.907
I'm not infected!

58:09.907 --> 58:12.358
- Well I'm not
taking any chances.

58:12.358 --> 58:15.050
So either strap yourself
in or leave the pod now

58:15.050 --> 58:17.328
and take your chances out there.

58:17.328 --> 58:18.950
- I'd prefer to leave.

58:18.950 --> 58:20.469
- There's the door.

58:20.469 --> 58:21.298
- Di,

58:21.298 --> 58:22.540
you can't go out there.

58:22.540 --> 58:24.128
That creature's still
out there somewhere.

58:24.128 --> 58:25.992
- I think my odds of
survival are better out there

58:25.992 --> 58:27.304
than they are out there.

58:27.304 --> 58:28.719
- Just let her go, Dirk.

58:28.719 --> 58:31.515
- Who says I wanna stay
in here alone with you?

58:31.515 --> 58:33.413
- Well then you're
free to go too.

58:33.413 --> 58:35.277
But just know, once
you're out there,

58:35.277 --> 58:37.590
there is no way you're
getting back in here.

58:37.590 --> 58:38.901
- Di,

58:38.901 --> 58:40.489
this is insane.

58:40.489 --> 58:42.077
Touch me again.

58:42.077 --> 58:44.735
You'll see you made a mistake.

58:44.735 --> 58:47.289
- It's going to kill
you if you stay in here.

58:47.289 --> 58:48.877
You should leave with me.

58:48.877 --> 58:50.257
It's your only hope.

58:50.257 --> 58:51.673
- You may be right,

58:51.673 --> 58:54.745
but why is it that psychics
don't play the lottery

58:54.745 --> 58:56.505
or stocks and trades?

58:59.128 --> 58:59.922
Hey, Di.

59:03.029 --> 59:04.651
- Holy shit!

59:09.276 --> 59:11.278
- I guess we know who's who.

59:19.735 --> 59:21.116
- How'd you know?

59:21.116 --> 59:23.532
- I took a calculated
guess and like I said,

59:23.532 --> 59:24.775
I don't trust psychics.

59:24.775 --> 59:27.053
There's usually
a trick involved.

59:27.053 --> 59:28.468
- What about me?

59:28.468 --> 59:30.815
- It was a nice ploy to
pretend the human was an alien

59:30.815 --> 59:33.024
while the alien
pretended to be human.

59:33.024 --> 59:35.510
But luckily for you and
me, I didn't buy it.

59:35.510 --> 59:36.787
- Dirk!

59:36.787 --> 59:38.961
First Officer Vickers!

59:38.961 --> 59:40.894
There's no escape from us.

59:40.894 --> 59:44.795
- Get the fuck out of here,
you shape-shifting bitch!

59:44.795 --> 59:47.418
- When it caught
me in the woods,

59:47.418 --> 59:49.282
I was afraid at first.

59:50.283 --> 59:51.284
Not anymore.

59:52.872 --> 59:54.943
The transformation can be

59:55.909 --> 59:57.566
quite pleasurable.

59:57.566 --> 59:58.912
And it's true,

59:58.912 --> 01:00:01.915
you do end up being manipulated.

01:00:01.915 --> 01:00:04.849
But human evolution has been
manipulated from the beginning

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:07.093
by Earth bound viruses.

01:00:07.093 --> 01:00:09.820
So why don't you come out, Dirk?

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.823
It's a new,
enlightening experience.

01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:18.138
A hundred times more stimulating

01:00:18.138 --> 01:00:20.658
than that silly bliss pill

01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:21.487
Join us

01:00:22.936 --> 01:00:26.423
and we'll be able to spread
out seed across the universe,

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:27.872
together.

01:00:27.872 --> 01:00:29.287
- Yo, news flash!

01:00:29.287 --> 01:00:31.393
We killed your offspring.

01:00:31.393 --> 01:00:35.052
- Actually, the human
female reproductive system

01:00:35.052 --> 01:00:37.261
makes for an excellent
breeding ground

01:00:37.261 --> 01:00:39.297
for our superior race,

01:00:39.297 --> 01:00:41.196
as you've witnessed.

01:00:41.196 --> 01:00:42.162
- Fuck.

01:00:42.162 --> 01:00:45.545
- Wit ha few slight alterations.

01:00:45.545 --> 01:00:47.340
- Screw you, Diamond.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.272
- Actually,

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.586
that's exactly what
we have in mind.

01:00:58.455 --> 01:00:59.973
- Are they going to?

01:00:59.973 --> 01:01:01.250
Ugh.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.597
- Get the fuck away
from my girlfriend.

01:01:02.597 --> 01:01:06.221
- She is not your
girlfriend anymore.

01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:07.464
- I've gotta go out there.

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:08.672
- No, don't!

01:01:08.672 --> 01:01:10.018
It's just another
one of their tricks.

01:01:10.018 --> 01:01:11.295
- That's not a fucking trick.

01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:14.022
She is going to have sex
with that space monster.

01:01:19.199 --> 01:01:20.028
- Ugh.

01:01:21.236 --> 01:01:24.688
- That is some sick
shit going on out there.

- We can't just stay in
here while they create

01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:54.778
an army of fucking
alien space monsters.

01:02:54.778 --> 01:02:56.089
- Do you have any good ideas?

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:57.470
They're far enough
away from the pod.

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:59.092
We can't fry them.

01:02:59.092 --> 01:03:01.474
- Rescue
vehicle in route.

01:03:01.474 --> 01:03:02.993
Rescue vehicle in route.

01:03:02.993 --> 01:03:04.926
- Oh shit, they
picked up our signal.

01:03:04.926 --> 01:03:05.754
- Who did?

01:03:05.754 --> 01:03:06.928
- The rescue ship.

01:03:06.928 --> 01:03:08.757
Their ETA is 24 hours.

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.346
- Can you tell them not to come?

01:03:11.346 --> 01:03:13.003
Our communication
is down, I can't.

01:03:13.003 --> 01:03:14.591
I can't tell them not to come.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:16.109
I can't warn them!

01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:18.525
- We just have to make sure
that by the time they get here

01:03:18.525 --> 01:03:20.631
we are still us!

01:03:20.631 --> 01:03:22.771
- They can look like
us, they can become us,

01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:24.635
they can trick us,
they already have.

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:27.845
- They're still out
there waiting for us.

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:29.157
- Let's get some rest.

01:03:29.157 --> 01:03:30.572
When it's light out,

01:03:30.572 --> 01:03:32.885
we're gonna hunt them
down and kill them.

01:03:32.885 --> 01:03:34.576
War begins tomorrow.

01:03:35.439 --> 01:03:36.923
- Do you have a plan?

01:03:36.923 --> 01:03:38.856
- Keep the door closed.

01:04:04.399 --> 01:04:06.401
- Where are you fuckers?

01:04:06.401 --> 01:04:08.955
- Where are you fuckers?

01:04:10.198 --> 01:04:11.717
- Come on!

01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:14.892
I know you're out
here somewhere!

01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:16.549
Come on!

01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:17.930
- Come on!

01:04:28.837 --> 01:04:29.666
- Dirk!

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:30.770
Stop!

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:31.737
It's just me.

01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:32.599
- Lana.

01:04:33.462 --> 01:04:35.326
Let me go grab the taser.

01:04:35.326 --> 01:04:37.570
It's time to find and fry them.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:39.123
- Yeah it is.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:49.686
- Lana?

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:50.963
What're you doing here?

01:04:50.963 --> 01:04:52.136
- What're you doing?

01:04:52.136 --> 01:04:53.379
Why's the door open?

01:04:53.379 --> 01:04:55.105
- I just went
outside for a minute.

01:04:55.105 --> 01:04:56.037
- By yourself?

01:04:56.037 --> 01:04:57.452
- Yeah, I wanted to take a look.

01:04:57.452 --> 01:04:59.868
- What did you find?

01:04:59.868 --> 01:05:00.973
- I found you.

01:05:02.837 --> 01:05:04.804
- How do I know
you're still you?

01:05:04.804 --> 01:05:07.911
- Because it's me,
Lana, you can trust me.

01:05:07.911 --> 01:05:10.637
- I wish you hadn't gotten
outside by yourself.

01:05:10.637 --> 01:05:12.778
- Get away from
that thing, Dirk.

01:05:14.365 --> 01:05:16.920
- You things can't fool me!

01:05:26.895 --> 01:05:27.793
- What?

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:28.897
What is it?

01:05:28.897 --> 01:05:30.243
- I just had a fucked up dream.

01:05:30.243 --> 01:05:33.039
- More fucked up than
the situation we're in?

01:05:33.039 --> 01:05:33.868
- Almost.

01:05:36.284 --> 01:05:37.388
It's morning.

01:05:39.425 --> 01:05:41.599
- Now the real fun begins.

01:05:55.303 --> 01:05:57.201
Why'd they do this?

01:05:57.201 --> 01:05:59.859
- They're just
trying to scare us.

01:05:59.859 --> 01:06:04.588
- It takes at least three
dismembered bodies to scare me.

01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:07.556
Worst comes to worse,

01:06:07.556 --> 01:06:10.214
we could always
overdose on bliss.

01:06:10.214 --> 01:06:13.942
I think I'd prefer a
heart attack to this.

01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:16.393
- It didn't stop them
from invading Kenny.

01:06:16.393 --> 01:06:17.290
- Point taken.

01:06:20.155 --> 01:06:23.780
- I am sick of these
motherfucking worms

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.506
on this motherfucking planet!

01:06:31.926 --> 01:06:32.927
- Thanks.

01:06:32.927 --> 01:06:34.342
- Don't mention it.

01:06:34.342 --> 01:06:37.794
Just next time, try
keeping your mouth shut.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.094
- Groovy.

01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:27.964
- Rescue
vehicle in route.

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:29.792
Rescue vehicle in route.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:31.450
T-minus three hours.

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:33.728
- Fresh victims on the way.

01:09:35.902 --> 01:09:38.939
- You think these
things have a weak spot?

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:40.562
- They haven't
brought back Kenny.

01:09:40.562 --> 01:09:43.220
- Yeah, his head was bashed in.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.982
And Terri was thrown
head first into the fire.

01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:50.055
- I'm thinking that if the
brain is severely damaged

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:51.988
there's no coming back.

01:09:53.782 --> 01:09:56.751
If I get taken over,
bash my brains in.

01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:58.684
- That's a cheery thought.

01:09:58.684 --> 01:10:00.651
- It's probably my last thought.

01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:03.723
- Are you
ready to join us?

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:12.318
Join us!

01:10:14.631 --> 01:10:16.460
- Here we go.

01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:30.957
- Later.

01:10:33.546 --> 01:10:35.617
- Join this, bitch!

01:10:46.007 --> 01:10:47.284
- Hi, Dirk.

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:48.803
I miss you, lover.

01:10:49.735 --> 01:10:52.462
And I know you miss me.

01:10:52.462 --> 01:10:54.774
I know everything about you.

01:10:56.362 --> 01:10:58.951
We can be together again, Dirk.

01:11:01.505 --> 01:11:03.024
Wouldn't you like that?

01:11:06.441 --> 01:11:09.237
- Not after watching you give
birth to fucking blood worms.

01:11:09.237 --> 01:11:12.689
- I can do thinks you
can't even imagine.

01:11:32.778 --> 01:11:36.678
You've never had deep
throat like this before.

01:11:36.678 --> 01:11:38.024
- I could use a hand here.

01:11:38.024 --> 01:11:38.853
Hello?!

01:11:54.938 --> 01:11:57.630
- How's this for deep throat?!

01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:06.881
- What the hell did you do?

01:12:06.881 --> 01:12:08.331
- Zach overdosed
on these things!

01:12:08.331 --> 01:12:10.471
Let's see what
happens to this guy!

01:12:27.936 --> 01:12:29.800
- Looks like you
could use a good poke.

01:12:30.698 --> 01:12:31.526
- No!

01:12:38.706 --> 01:12:40.570
- That was truly heartfelt.

01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:42.227
- Probably not what
Kenny's father had in mind

01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:44.160
when he created this stuff.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.747
But it works for me.

01:12:45.747 --> 01:12:47.370
One down,

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:48.681
one to go.

01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:49.579
The leader.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.823
- Where is she?

01:12:52.823 --> 01:12:54.791
She was right here!

01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:56.068
- She's probably not that happy

01:12:56.068 --> 01:12:58.174
that we just killed
her fuck buddy.

01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:01.107
- What do you think
she's gonna do about it?

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:16.537
- Come on!

01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:29.619
Shit.

01:13:32.484 --> 01:13:35.625
Looks like it's time to
finish this once and for all.

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.696
Are you with me, Dirk?

01:13:44.737 --> 01:13:45.566
Guess not.

01:13:47.775 --> 01:13:49.570
- Time for a face off.

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:51.088
- Where's Dirk?

01:13:51.088 --> 01:13:52.573
- You were right.

01:13:52.573 --> 01:13:54.851
He should keep his mouth shut.

01:13:54.851 --> 01:13:58.199
Won't be long, soon
as he sees the light.

01:13:58.199 --> 01:14:01.961
- Why would you blow up
our only means of escape?

01:14:01.961 --> 01:14:03.618
I thought you wanted
to get out of here

01:14:03.618 --> 01:14:05.344
as much as we did.

01:14:05.344 --> 01:14:07.795
- I know about the rescue team

01:14:07.795 --> 01:14:10.522
and they've already
pinpointed the pod's location.

01:14:10.522 --> 01:14:13.490
You know, I'm really
looking forward to visiting

01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:16.217
your beautiful, blue home planet

01:14:16.217 --> 01:14:18.495
and all its inhabitants.

01:14:18.495 --> 01:14:20.704
- You seem to know
a lot about Earth.

01:14:20.704 --> 01:14:23.742
- A lot of useful
information is stored up here

01:14:23.742 --> 01:14:26.607
and Diamond really
was a special girl.

01:14:26.607 --> 01:14:28.850
More powerful than
even she knew.

01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:33.407
- Well maybe I can help you
open your cranial capacity!

01:14:37.963 --> 01:14:40.276
- Di wasn't just an empath.

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:42.899
He had telekinetic powers too.

01:14:42.899 --> 01:14:46.385
I couldn't ask
for a better host.

01:14:46.385 --> 01:14:49.008
Between her powers and my will,

01:14:49.008 --> 01:14:51.494
nothing can stop our race.

01:14:51.494 --> 01:14:52.460
- Yeah right!

01:14:56.464 --> 01:14:57.362
- Nice try.

01:15:06.957 --> 01:15:08.925
Why don't you just lay back?

01:15:09.857 --> 01:15:10.685
Relax.

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:15.069
And enjoy the incoming invasion.

01:15:19.176 --> 01:15:22.214
Once we get you warmed up,
you'll be begging for more.

01:15:46.687 --> 01:15:49.172
- Fuck with someone
your own size!

01:15:49.172 --> 01:15:50.000
Just die!

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.045
I can't believe you saved
me a for a second time.

01:16:00.045 --> 01:16:01.253
- I told you.

01:16:01.253 --> 01:16:03.704
I don't like being used.

01:16:03.704 --> 01:16:06.431
I would never
accuse you of that.

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:10.504
- Don't!

01:16:10.504 --> 01:16:11.367
No!

01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:12.229
Don't! Don't!

01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:13.161
- Did she?

01:16:13.161 --> 01:16:14.784
- I can feel them inside me!

01:16:14.784 --> 01:16:16.164
Those worms!

01:16:16.164 --> 01:16:18.719
Now they're trying
to take control.

01:16:18.719 --> 01:16:20.548
They're burrowing
inside my brain!

01:16:20.548 --> 01:16:22.274
- No, maybe I can get them out!

01:16:22.274 --> 01:16:24.966
- No, you have to kill me!

01:16:24.966 --> 01:16:26.382
Kill me now!

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:27.210
- No! No!

01:16:34.355 --> 01:16:35.356
- It's okay.

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:38.048
I feel much better.

01:16:38.048 --> 01:16:39.429
- Oh no.

01:16:39.429 --> 01:16:40.775
- Come on, Lana.

01:16:42.121 --> 01:16:42.950
Join us.

01:16:44.814 --> 01:16:45.953
- No! No!

01:16:45.953 --> 01:16:47.161
No!

01:18:03.064 --> 01:18:04.169
- No!

01:18:04.169 --> 01:18:05.515
Don't touch her!

01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:06.792
She's a monster.

01:18:06.792 --> 01:18:08.484
Didn't you see all
those body parts?

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:09.623
- You idiot!

01:18:09.623 --> 01:18:11.107
This woman is fatally wounded.

01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:12.039
- Good!

01:18:12.039 --> 01:18:13.661
- I didn't have enough time!

01:18:13.661 --> 01:18:15.042
It all happened so fast.

01:18:15.042 --> 01:18:16.388
- Good job.

01:18:16.388 --> 01:18:17.907
She killed all my friends.

01:18:17.907 --> 01:18:19.633
She bashed Kenny's head in.

01:18:19.633 --> 01:18:21.600
He was my best friend.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.222
She's a monster.

01:18:23.222 --> 01:18:24.845
Thank you.

01:18:24.845 --> 01:18:26.156
- Hey, get the
fuck away from me!

01:18:26.156 --> 01:18:27.641
Scotty, get away from him!

01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:29.194
- Guys, what's the problem?

01:18:29.194 --> 01:18:31.092
- Whatever it is that got into
her could've gotten into you.

01:18:31.092 --> 01:18:32.300
- Sir, I told you--

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.474
- You are gonna
wait on this planet

01:18:33.474 --> 01:18:35.096
until a special
remote control vehicle

01:18:35.096 --> 01:18:36.304
comes and picks you up!

01:18:36.304 --> 01:18:37.513
- Sir.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:40.412
- I'm sorry but I can't
take any more chances

01:18:40.412 --> 01:18:42.379
and you were in an awful
hurry to off that woman.

01:18:42.379 --> 01:18:43.449
- I told you!

01:18:43.449 --> 01:18:44.899
She killed everyone!

01:18:44.899 --> 01:18:45.969
Come on, please!

01:18:45.969 --> 01:18:47.005
You can't leave me here!

01:18:47.005 --> 01:18:48.351
Get me out of here!

01:18:48.351 --> 01:18:50.042
I got a lot of
money back on Earth!

01:18:50.042 --> 01:18:51.112
A lot of it!

01:18:51.112 --> 01:18:52.320
I'll pay you!

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.839
- Sorry for the inconvenience,

01:18:53.839 --> 01:18:55.979
but it'll just be
a few more hours.

01:18:55.979 --> 01:18:57.463
Scotty, let's go.

01:18:57.463 --> 01:19:00.812
- If that's the
way it's gotta be.

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:08.578
- Scotty, what the hell?

01:19:11.201 --> 01:19:12.444
- Yes!

01:19:12.444 --> 01:19:15.861
I am loving these
telekinetic powers!

01:19:15.861 --> 01:19:18.243
Scotty, I don't know
how to fly a space ship,

01:19:18.243 --> 01:19:20.763
so your services are needed.

01:19:20.763 --> 01:19:22.385
- Aye, Captain.

01:19:27.528 --> 01:19:28.667
- Well, Lana.

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:29.910
- Dirk.

01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:31.532
- You put up a good fight,

01:19:31.532 --> 01:19:33.569
but you were destined to lose.

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:35.053
I knew it all along.

01:19:35.053 --> 01:19:37.503
That's why I had Diamond
tell you our whole story.

01:19:37.503 --> 01:19:40.058
You were never a threat to us.

01:19:40.058 --> 01:19:42.957
In fact, it was
really, really fun.

01:19:44.407 --> 01:19:49.032
Now, I could heal you and turn
you right now but I won't.

01:19:49.032 --> 01:19:50.862
I'll let you stay human.

01:19:50.862 --> 01:19:52.518
I think you'd want it that way.

01:19:52.518 --> 01:19:55.004
And as you die, here,
on this dust ball,

01:19:55.004 --> 01:19:58.110
remember that I'll be
on Earth in the warm sun

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:01.597
and everyone you ever knew
and loved will be one of us.

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:03.599
All your nieces and nephews

01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:05.980
and your mommy and your daddy,

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.776
if they're still kicking it.

01:20:08.776 --> 01:20:11.676
Just let that roll around
in your head a little bit.

01:20:11.676 --> 01:20:13.263
Good bye.

01:20:13.263 --> 01:20:14.368
- Dirk.

01:20:14.368 --> 01:20:15.990
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:17.509
Begging for death?

01:20:18.372 --> 01:20:20.546
- I had fun too.

01:20:20.546 --> 01:20:24.654
But remember what I told
you about your mouth.

01:20:37.218 --> 01:20:40.497
- All right, let's get
the hell out of dodge!

01:20:48.471 --> 01:20:50.611
- Remember what I said, Dirk.

01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:51.612
- Go!

01:20:51.612 --> 01:20:52.578
Go!

01:20:52.578 --> 01:20:55.720
- Keep your fucking mouth shut.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:56.652
- Go!
