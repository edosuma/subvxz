00:00.301 --> 00:04.670
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.106 --> 00:08.340
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:10.309
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:11.744
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.746 --> 00:13.278
<i> my cousin had already grown up</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:16.115
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.117 --> 00:17.983
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:17.985 --> 00:22.087
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.757 --> 00:24.189
<i> To most people</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:26.291
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.293 --> 00:28.027
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>

00:28.029 --> 00:29.628
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.630 --> 00:31.730
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.732 --> 00:34.566
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.603 --> 00:39.038
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:39.040 --> 00:40.739
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.741 --> 00:42.441
James?

00:42.443 --> 00:45.310
You've created a force
that could take over
the galaxy.

00:45.312 --> 00:48.180
And all of it will be ours.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.383
Everyone in the city
is affected by this
alien signal.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.652
-Catch.
-Kara: <i> They're acting</i>
<i> like automatons.</i>

00:53.654 --> 00:54.753
No!

00:55.823 --> 00:57.489
Oh, my god.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.292
If you come to national city,
myriad will take over you too.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.727
I am going to help her...

01:03.097 --> 01:05.064
...whatever the cost.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.199
I am not going to
fight my sister.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.534
Non: <i> You have no choice.</i>

01:08.536 --> 01:11.737
Kill Alex danvers
or let her kill you.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.205
Either way...

01:13.207 --> 01:14.540
You lose.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.013
Ugh.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.281
(Grunts)

01:40.835 --> 01:41.967
(Grunting)

01:41.969 --> 01:43.936
(Straining)

01:43.938 --> 01:46.538
Alex, I know you're in there.

01:46.540 --> 01:50.375
This isn't you.
You don't wanna do this.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.877
You left me no choice.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.712
(Grunting)

02:18.038 --> 02:19.905
(Groaning)

02:19.907 --> 02:22.608
You're reunited with
astra in the light of rao,

02:22.610 --> 02:26.345
you tell her
her wishes have
all come true.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.880
Eliza: Alex, stop!

02:29.550 --> 02:30.782
This isn't you.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.123
The martian's
protecting your mind.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.292
Who knows for how long,
by the looks of him.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.793
As long as he has to.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.296
If only you could have
protected Alex's.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.466
Now her mother has to watch.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.568
Alex, you can beat this.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.570
I know you can.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.742
You're not gonna hurt me.
You're not gonna hurt Kara.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.177
We are a family.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.478
Stronger together.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.514
Alex, you are the
strongest of us all.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.950
Your father always said that.

03:04.952 --> 03:08.654
I know he's watching over you.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.991
I know he'd be so proud.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.294
Your father believed in you.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.962
I believe in you, too.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.832
You are Alex danvers

03:20.834 --> 03:23.368
and nothing on earth
can change that.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.939
(Softly) So, come
back to us, sweetie.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.343
Please, come back.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.784
-Mom?
-Yes.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.322
(Panting) I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.294
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.298
(Groaning)

03:54.168 --> 03:55.834
I'm so sorry. (Sobbing)

04:01.842 --> 04:05.110
So, Supergirl's plan
is to broadcast a symbol...

04:05.112 --> 04:07.012
-Of hope.
-Of hope.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.981
-With a speech.
-A speech?

04:08.983 --> 04:10.716
Also about hope.

04:13.187 --> 04:16.355
But how will she cut through
myriad and reach the people?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.990
Supergirl is my protege,

04:17.992 --> 04:19.725
reaching people is what I do.

04:19.727 --> 04:23.762
Plus, there is
scientific evidence
that supports my plan.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.897
-Max?
-Maxwell: Myriad
works by shutting down

04:25.899 --> 04:27.633
the connection
between the amygdala

04:27.635 --> 04:30.936
and the rostral anterior
cingulate cortex.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.740
The parts of the human
brain that give rise to
optimism and hope.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.843
Under myriad,
i could see,
i could hear,

04:37.845 --> 04:40.312
but it was like
i was a complete
stranger to myself.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.881
And then my mother
said something
about my father

04:42.883 --> 04:45.684
and it was like a switch
went off in my brain.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.886
I could suddenly feel again.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.889
I could feel hope.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.557
And that's what she's
gonna give them

04:52.559 --> 04:54.192
once Max can kick start
the connections.

04:54.194 --> 04:57.029
If. This equipment's
a dinosaur.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.631
If I can get her speech on TV

04:59.633 --> 05:01.933
and the symbol on
computers and phones,

05:01.935 --> 05:03.935
I'm even more of a
genius than I thought.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.406
Okay, we're ready.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.641
Okay. She's ready too.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.780
In three, two...

05:17.351 --> 05:19.051
People of national city.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.087
This is Supergirl

05:25.459 --> 05:27.659
and I hope you can hear me.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.331
We have been attacked.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.500
Mothers and fathers,

05:35.502 --> 05:38.036
friends and neighbors,
children, everyone,

05:39.306 --> 05:42.007
suddenly stopped
by a force of evil

05:42.009 --> 05:44.076
as great as this world
has ever known.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.114
<i> Your attacker has sought</i>
<i> to take your free will,</i>

05:50.384 --> 05:52.517
<i> your individuality,</i>

05:53.020 --> 05:54.386
<i> your spirit.</i>

05:54.388 --> 05:55.821
<i> Everything that makes</i>
<i> you who you are.</i>

05:59.693 --> 06:01.360
When facing an
attack like this,

06:01.362 --> 06:05.430
it's easy to feel hopeless.

06:05.432 --> 06:08.500
<i> We retreat,</i>
<i> we lose our strength,</i>

06:08.502 --> 06:09.835
<i> lose our self.</i>

06:12.039 --> 06:13.105
<i> I know.</i>

06:15.476 --> 06:18.910
I lost everything
when I was young.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.382
When I first landed
on this planet,

06:23.384 --> 06:25.884
I was sad and alone.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.521
But I found out

06:30.591 --> 06:34.159
that there is so much
love in this world

06:34.161 --> 06:35.694
out there for the taking,

06:37.631 --> 06:41.066
and you, the people
of national city,

06:41.068 --> 06:42.601
you helped me.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.071
<i> You let me be</i>
<i> who I'm meant to be.</i>

06:58.085 --> 07:00.419
(Gasps)

07:00.421 --> 07:03.422
<i> You gave me back to myself.</i>

07:03.424 --> 07:07.893
<i> You made me stronger</i>
<i> than I ever thought possible,</i>

07:08.529 --> 07:10.896
<i> and I love you for that.</i>

07:18.839 --> 07:20.739
<i> Now, in each</i>
<i> and every one of you,</i>

07:20.741 --> 07:22.641
<i> there is a light, a spirit,</i>

07:22.643 --> 07:24.476
<i> that cannot be snuffed out.</i>

07:25.279 --> 07:26.745
<i> That won't give up.</i>

07:29.349 --> 07:31.650
<i> I need your help again.</i>

07:31.652 --> 07:34.453
<i> I need you to hope.</i>

07:35.989 --> 07:38.323
Hope.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.660
That you will remember
that you can all be heroes.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.763
Hope.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.498
That when faced with an enemy

07:46.500 --> 07:48.433
determined
to destroy your spirit,

07:48.435 --> 07:51.102
you will fight back
and thrive.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.704
<i> Hope.</i>

07:52.706 --> 07:55.073
<i> That those who once</i>
<i> may have shunned you will,</i>

07:55.075 --> 07:57.342
<i> in a moment of crisis,</i>
<i> come to your aid.</i>

07:57.344 --> 07:58.643
(Cell phones ringing)

08:03.784 --> 08:05.116
Hope.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.855
That you will see again
the faces of those you love

08:11.158 --> 08:13.258
<i> and perhaps even those</i>
<i> you have lost.</i>

08:20.767 --> 08:22.100
I love you, Kara.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.703
(Phones ringing)

08:36.316 --> 08:37.649
It's working.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.118
(Chuckles)

08:45.492 --> 08:47.292
Myriad has failed.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.029
I have failed.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.598
But I refuse to let
astra's entire life

08:53.600 --> 08:55.267
be undone by that...

08:57.037 --> 08:58.069
That child.

09:01.875 --> 09:06.878
Your only failure
was dreaming too small.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.449
There are endless worlds
out there to conquer, my love.

09:11.451 --> 09:16.221
Worlds without that
bleeding heart
blonde Kryptonian.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.893
-What do we do?
-We finish off the job.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.597
We kill the humans

09:25.599 --> 09:28.900
and we leave
Kara Zor-El behind

09:28.902 --> 09:31.603
as queen of a dead earth.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.586
Thank you.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.091
(Exhales) That's more like it.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.361
-Winn: Kara.
-Hi.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.429
Hey.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.998
Hey, listen, um...

10:00.000 --> 10:04.069
Just the things
that we said to you...

10:04.071 --> 10:05.637
What he's trying to say
is that we're sorry.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.439
It wasn't you. This is you.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.446
Um, and thanks, you know,

10:14.448 --> 10:18.783
-for saving our lives.
-Yeah.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.118
(Chuckles)

10:25.359 --> 10:26.891
Hey, Kara,

10:26.893 --> 10:30.629
nobody could have
saved all three of us.
Not even Clark.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.498
Well, the deo is working
to find non and indigo,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.133
and when they do,

10:35.135 --> 10:36.768
they'll pay for what they did.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.770
James: Yeah.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.741
Well, I'm just happy
that you're safe

10:42.743 --> 10:44.709
and the three of us
are back together.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.544
(Chuckles) Me too.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.381
But I think we should
talk about that thing
that happened, uh,

10:49.383 --> 10:51.082
right before myriad struck.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.817
The thing.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.918
Yeah, the thing thing.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.720
(Gasps) The thing.

10:55.722 --> 10:56.788
Hmm.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.326
Oh, this thing has
nothing to do with me.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.562
All good. I got other things.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.432
-You kissed me.
-I kissed you.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.000
You did.

11:09.002 --> 11:13.138
So, I'm sorry if I kissed
you when you weren't
in control of yourself,

11:13.140 --> 11:14.506
because I am
all about consent.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.575
(Chuckles) I know.
I was myself.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.444
Mostly.

11:19.446 --> 11:23.114
And how did yourself
feel about that?

11:24.718 --> 11:27.952
Cat: The morning meeting
was to begin 16 seconds ago.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.655
You people were more
punctual when you were drones.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.123
-Scurry!
-Later?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.892
-Later.
-Cat: Today, please.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.794
-Uh, after the scurrying.
-Yeah.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.548
General Lane: Lucy.

12:03.657 --> 12:04.789
I'm glad you're here.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.725
Did you have any doubt
that I would come?

12:09.429 --> 12:12.731
So, how is it that superman
is still down for the count?

12:12.733 --> 12:13.932
We don't know.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.267
We're hoping he regains
consciousness soon.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.137
You can re-secure
the prisoner
j'onn j'onzz now.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.573
You're cuffing him?
He's wounded.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.309
He just helped save
this whole city. All of us.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.911
What he has done
subsequent to his crimes

12:26.913 --> 12:28.847
is neither here
nor there, luce.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.482
Don't you get it, dad?

12:30.484 --> 12:33.451
As long as you keep treating
everything as black and white,

12:33.453 --> 12:36.588
you're gonna breeding the same
type of hate and resentment

12:36.590 --> 12:39.824
that allowed the Kryptonians
to try to destroy us today.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.727
I am trying to protect us.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.997
Especially you, Lucy.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.299
And that is what is so sad.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.368
It's because you keep
pushing me away.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.771
Like you pushed away Lois.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.346
J'onn, I'm so sorry.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.648
It's not like I'm going
anywhere anyway.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.218
Your father's only doing
what he thinks is right.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.224
Fathers are like that
with their daughters.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.498
(Sighs deeply)

13:21.301 --> 13:22.901
Hey, I got it.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.803
-Oh, no.
-I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I got it.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.471
Having your mind controlled
and getting into a death match

13:26.473 --> 13:28.773
with me is a lot for one day.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.777
Alex, I have to ask
you something

13:32.779 --> 13:35.246
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.782
Why did you and j'onn j'onzz

13:37.784 --> 13:39.450
really come to see me
in midvale?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.820
And why wouldn't you tell me?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.923
I can handle anything.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.360
You probably wanna sit down.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.939
Dad is still alive.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.375
What?

14:05.879 --> 14:06.978
No.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.880
No. That, that's not possible.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.815
It's been ten years ago.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.218
J'onn saw into the mind
of the man that captured him.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.752
They have him
at a secret facility

14:14.754 --> 14:15.854
called cadmus.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.589
But why would he be there?

14:17.591 --> 14:19.891
Why would they bring
your father there and keep
him there for so long?

14:19.893 --> 14:23.194
-It doesn't make any sense.
-I don't know.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.863
But once non and indigo
are captured,

14:24.865 --> 14:27.632
j'onn and i
are gonna go find him

14:27.634 --> 14:28.933
and we're gonna
bring him home.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.001
We all will.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.439
Maxwell: Well, isn't this
a hallmark moment?

14:34.441 --> 14:36.841
Don't you have someplace
better to be?

14:36.843 --> 14:38.243
Like at lord tech?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.879
Helping your employees get
through what just happened?

14:40.881 --> 14:42.580
That's what corporate shrinks
on retainer are for.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.183
Me, I'm more worried about
what's still happening.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.351
Still happening?

14:46.353 --> 14:47.719
Everyone's been protected.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.320
No one's mind
is being controlled.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.356
True. But I went to see
how much damage

14:51.358 --> 14:53.558
the Kryptonians had
done to my lte network

14:53.560 --> 14:56.427
and I found out that since
we ended their mind control,

14:56.429 --> 14:59.864
the myriad wave
has been amplified

14:59.866 --> 15:03.201
ten-fold and is rising
exponentially.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.203
Amplified? To what end?

15:05.205 --> 15:07.171
Emergency rooms all over
the city have been filled

15:07.173 --> 15:09.007
with people complaining
about headaches.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.509
They're from myriad,

15:11.511 --> 15:14.078
which, by my calculations,
will continue to amplify

15:14.080 --> 15:16.014
until pop goes the cranium.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.753
The Kryptonians
couldn't control us,

15:21.755 --> 15:24.656
so instead,
they're going to kill us.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.358
All of us.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.666
The Kryptonians were using
myriad for mind control

15:34.668 --> 15:37.035
because the frequency
penetrates neural tissue.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.971
Now, they're increasing
the frequency.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.272
Exponentially.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.674
We're talking terahertz jumps.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.410
That's like using an uzi
on a mosquito.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.778
And we're the mosquito.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.780
Once the wave reaches
its full potential,

15:48.782 --> 15:50.114
the electromagnetic energy

15:50.116 --> 15:51.883
will create enough
pressure to... (Sighs)

15:51.885 --> 15:54.285
To kill every human
on the planet like you said.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.454
I need to tell James and winn.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.722
Let's not get our
cape in a bunch.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.823
He's right.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.292
Telling them wouldn't do
us any good right now.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.462
-How long do we have?
-Four hours.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.197
I usually love a good
countdown, but this is bad.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.765
This is really bad.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.467
Think you can find the source
so we can shut it down?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.170
You're lucky I work well
under pressure.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.605
Ma'ams, you're needed
in the armory.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.607
Find the source.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.851
Maxwell: Finding them
will be the easy part.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.486
Defeating them with only you,

16:29.189 --> 16:30.555
that's our problem.

16:32.359 --> 16:35.193
And to think I thought
you'd learned by now,

16:35.195 --> 16:36.527
I can handle anything.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.628
I'm not trying to be an ass.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.230
I know you can
handle anything.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.531
But I'm actually worried.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.000
And if the others
were thinking straight,

16:42.002 --> 16:43.501
they'd be worried, too.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.504
You have no backup.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.040
Your sidekick
j'onn j'onzz is injured,

16:49.042 --> 16:52.143
the deo's resources
have been depleted
from the prison break,

16:52.145 --> 16:55.813
and even if they weren't,
no human can go out there.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.516
Their heads would
explode if they got too
close to the source.

16:59.853 --> 17:03.388
If you go out there and fight,
you might win.

17:04.824 --> 17:08.159
But chances are this
is a suicide mission.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.827
You know I'll
never stop trying.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.263
Believe me, no one's rooting
for you more than I am.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.501
I just want you to know
what you're facing,

17:16.503 --> 17:18.236
so that you're prepared.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.672
I will stop non and indigo.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.541
Good.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.414
Hey...

17:33.119 --> 17:34.819
Don't tell Alex my odds, okay?

18:01.614 --> 18:02.680
(Sighs)

18:05.118 --> 18:06.250
Winn: Hey.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.785
Whoa.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.188
You look like you could
jump in on that lunch order.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.722
They just called it in.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.625
No, it's fine. I've had like,
four lunches already.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.627
Really?

18:16.629 --> 18:17.895
Just, no offense, you just

18:17.897 --> 18:20.098
kinda have that
little hypoglycemic

18:20.100 --> 18:23.367
i-haven't-eaten-in-25-minutes
look. (Chuckles)

18:23.369 --> 18:24.635
Sorry. Here.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.541
I know I don't
say this enough,

18:30.543 --> 18:32.477
or ever, really...

18:34.914 --> 18:36.614
Thank you.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.183
For what? You're
the one that, uh,

18:39.185 --> 18:43.754
that just saved everyone
from super mind-control ray...

18:43.756 --> 18:45.890
No, that's not
what I mean. I...

18:47.327 --> 18:52.063
Thank you for being such
a great friend always.

18:52.065 --> 18:57.101
From my first day
at work here,
(Inhales deeply)

18:57.103 --> 18:59.437
My first day as Supergirl,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.708
your friendship has been one
of the best parts of my life.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.746
Could you, uh, just eat a
red vine, will ya?

19:08.748 --> 19:11.482
You're starting to get sappy,
even for me.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.251
Cat: Ker-rah!

19:13.253 --> 19:16.721
(Sighs) Go, uh,
tame the beast.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.060
Ker-rah, go get me one of
those moon juice smoothies

19:23.062 --> 19:25.596
with the Chinese herbs that
Gwyneth keeps talking about.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.932
-I want one every two hours.
-(Stammering)

19:29.235 --> 19:31.068
But you hate Chinese herbs.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.437
-And Gwyneth.
-Not true.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.439
I don't like the coldplay guy,

19:35.441 --> 19:38.142
but ever since they
consciously uncoupled,
i like gwynny more than ever.

19:38.144 --> 19:41.546
You see, ker-rah, we have
been through hell
in the last few days.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.581
We survived.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.950
Lesson, don't ever
take life for granted,

19:45.952 --> 19:47.685
always take good
care of yourself,

19:47.687 --> 19:50.288
reject the latte
and drink the green juice.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.589
Carpe diem.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.264
Ms. Grant.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.134
I just want you to know
that working for you
is a true honor.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.869
You are my role model

20:06.573 --> 20:09.006
and you lead this city with
such strength and grace,

20:09.008 --> 20:12.043
and underneath
that prickly exterior,

20:14.447 --> 20:18.182
ahem, you have
the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.550
I just...

20:20.320 --> 20:21.953
I'm just trying to say

20:21.955 --> 20:26.457
thank you for being
an amazing mentor
and friend.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.827
Okay, so,

20:29.829 --> 20:33.564
that was either my eulogy
or your dictated suicide note.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.466
Is there something
you need to tell me?

20:35.468 --> 20:38.436
No, no, I'm just
taking your advice.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.471
Carpe diem.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.873
Okay. Okay.

20:42.875 --> 20:47.612
Well, you've made
quite the impression
on me, too, ker-rah.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.914
Now, go fetch me
that juice. Chop-chop.

20:58.891 --> 20:59.991
Hey.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.559
Hey.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.494
Just thinking about you.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.297
-You were?
-Yeah.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.332
I was thinking that we should

21:08.334 --> 21:11.902
finish that conversation
that we started earlier
that was interrupted.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.638
Yeah, it seems like we're
always getting interrupted,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.339
-doesn't it?
-(Chuckles)

21:15.341 --> 21:16.741
Yeah, it does.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.610
Maybe there's a reason.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.481
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

21:23.483 --> 21:26.951
you and me, maybe we're
just not meant to be.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.454
-That's kind of a big leap.
-James,

21:30.456 --> 21:32.757
I know in my heart,

21:32.759 --> 21:35.459
that we could've
been happy together.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.728
But we missed our chance.

21:37.730 --> 21:41.866
And now, the most important
thing to me is that
you find happiness.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.100
Find someone

21:43.102 --> 21:45.603
who appreciates
how amazing you are.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.039
Kara, wait.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.540
Kara, why are you saying this?
What's going on with you?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.208
Nothing. I just...

21:53.680 --> 21:56.547
I care about you a lot,
James Olsen.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.316
Always remember that.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.751
-Kara.
-I can't. I have to go.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.004
I hate seeing you like this.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.572
I'm not concerned
about the shackles.

22:21.574 --> 22:24.842
-I am concerned about you.
-Don't be.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.811
Max lord says he's very
close to finding

22:26.813 --> 22:28.145
the source of the myriad wave,

22:28.147 --> 22:31.315
and once he does,
I'll have my mission.

22:31.317 --> 22:34.285
James Olsen called
Lucy to tell her that
you've been acting strange,

22:34.287 --> 22:37.054
like you were saying
goodbye or something.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.958
I didn't mean to worry him.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.095
I just...

22:47.066 --> 22:48.966
We both know
what I'm up against.

22:51.104 --> 22:53.604
I will save the earth,
i promise you that.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.042
I just don't know
if I'll make it out alive.

23:01.114 --> 23:04.915
I didn't say the things
that needed to be said
when I left Krypton

23:04.917 --> 23:07.318
and I wanted to make sure
that I said them now.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.287
Just in case.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.292
I was exactly
where you are, Kara.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.629
And when I was,
you told me
to never give up.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.164
I'm not giving up.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.168
But my mother
didn't send me to earth

23:24.170 --> 23:28.639
to fall in love with a human,
have children,

23:28.641 --> 23:31.909
live in a house with
a white picket fence.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.012
She sent me here
to protect Kal-El.

23:35.014 --> 23:38.749
And now, I will use my
powers to protect the earth.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.918
And if I die achieving that,

23:41.754 --> 23:43.320
I'm at peace with it.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.025
I'll join my mother.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.628
We'll be together
in rao's light.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.618
-What do you got, Max?
-Found 'em.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.287
Thanks to this
pretty little thing.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.190
An omegahedron.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.292
We used these as energy
sources on Krypton.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.461
Just one of those can
power an entire city.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.696
Well, this one's powering the
destruction of this planet.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.097
It's powering the myriad wave,

24:27.099 --> 24:28.666
and its energy is building
by the second.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.167
So where are the
Kryptonians hiding?

24:30.169 --> 24:32.603
About 500 miles
northeast of here.
Nevada.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.138
What the hell is in Nevada?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.906
In my experience,
mediocre buffets and regret.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.644
It's fort rozz.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.279
What, you just left it there?

24:42.281 --> 24:46.150
You try moving
a one million-ton
alien spacecraft.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.652
We did the only
thing we could.

24:48.654 --> 24:52.223
We concealed it using its own
stealth technology,

24:52.225 --> 24:54.959
cordoned off the area and
called it a nuclear test zone.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.661
Making it the
perfect place to hide.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.829
They've been there
the whole time.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.631
I'll find them.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.501
-I'll shut it down.
-J'onn j'onzz: Not
by yourself you won't.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.237
I'm coming with you.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.739
-You're still under arrest.
-And you're hurt.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.642
There are too many
lives at risk to send
an agent in alone.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.010
I'm not releasing you.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.045
You're a threat
to national security.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.114
And you're dead if you don't
allow me to take this mission.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.116
She's gonna need all
the help she can get.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.487
Release him.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.890
Now.

25:28.494 --> 25:32.096
Take the other cuff
off of the martian.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.365
I got it.

25:36.402 --> 25:37.468
Let's do this.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.871
J'onn, Supergirl,

25:42.942 --> 25:44.241
be careful.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.979
Keep it safe for me?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.419
You didn't say goodbye
to your sister.

25:55.421 --> 25:57.521
If I say goodbye,
I'm never leaving.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.797
So, how do we smoke them out?

26:07.867 --> 26:09.366
I think we just did.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.873
-Where is your army?
-Already in their
sleeping pods.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.775
Ready for the
journey that awaits

26:17.777 --> 26:20.110
once we dispense
with the two of you.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.279
-And the omegahedron?
-It's right here.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.148
Take it.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.085
Smash it into little bits.
You still won't stop us.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.922
It's just a means to an end.
Its power comes from her.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.224
Can't smash that
to little bits, huh?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.493
This is not what astra wanted.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.530
Please, don't kill everyone.

26:39.532 --> 26:42.466
Your aunt wanted
to save this planet.

26:42.468 --> 26:45.636
The humans' extinction
will do just that.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.771
Like Noah after the flood.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.874
Only without Noah. Or you.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.146
Ugh!

26:58.384 --> 27:00.184
Sir, we're almost
at critical pitch.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.586
-How much time do we have?
-Less than six minutes.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.054
Then our heads go boom.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.191
(Timer beeping)

27:07.994 --> 27:09.593
Come on, Supergirl.

27:11.530 --> 27:12.963
(Grunting)

27:17.970 --> 27:20.604
Computer:
<i> Signal at 80% strength.</i>

27:20.606 --> 27:22.172
(Sharp ringing)

27:22.942 --> 27:24.341
(Grunting)

27:26.912 --> 27:29.346
(Grunting)

27:33.519 --> 27:35.052
(People groaning)

27:47.400 --> 27:48.565
Oh!

27:50.436 --> 27:51.502
Whoops.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.979
Computer:
<i> Signal at 90% strength.</i>

28:01.981 --> 28:03.414
(Breathing heavily)

28:05.651 --> 28:07.017
Ugh, five minutes.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.919
(Timer beeping)

28:10.256 --> 28:12.456
Tell your parents
i said hello.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.524
Tell them yourself!

28:14.694 --> 28:15.959
(Grunting)

28:25.671 --> 28:28.439
It's time for you
to join your people, martian.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.407
(Yelling)

28:31.544 --> 28:32.609
(Grunting)

28:41.554 --> 28:42.619
(Screaming)

28:43.923 --> 28:45.189
(J'onn j'onzz grunting)

28:46.792 --> 28:48.058
(Straining)

28:52.832 --> 28:54.131
(Straining)

28:57.103 --> 28:58.602
(Yelling)

29:02.775 --> 29:04.241
(Panting)

29:09.682 --> 29:12.049
We did it. We won.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.119
-Are you okay?
-I will be.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.087
Let's shut down myriad.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.190
Indigo: It can't be
shut down, fools.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.659
I already locked the system.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.194
The engines won't fire.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.131
You won't be able to
fly fort rozz away.

29:27.133 --> 29:30.167
All you'll be able
do is sit back

29:30.169 --> 29:32.336
and watch everyone
around you die.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.006
But between Krypton and Mars,

29:36.008 --> 29:38.075
I guess that's
old hat for you two.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.653
(Timer beeping)

29:51.357 --> 29:53.290
They're not gonna stop
them, are they?

30:02.701 --> 30:06.370
Ma'am, it's Supergirl.
She needs to talk to you.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.706
Supergirl, what's going on?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.608
The myriad signal
is still escalating.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.678
We defeated non and indigo,

30:14.680 --> 30:18.782
but we can't stop the
myriad wave and we
can't power the ship.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.851
<i> I'm going to fly fort rozz</i>
<i> into space myself.</i>

30:20.853 --> 30:23.854
It's the only way we can
get myriad off the planet.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.256
<i> That is not an option, Kara.</i>

30:26.258 --> 30:28.859
Once you're in space,
there's no atmosphere.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.194
There's no gravity.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.461
You wouldn't be able
to generate thrust,

30:31.463 --> 30:33.463
you wouldn't
be able to breathe,

30:33.465 --> 30:35.132
<i> you wouldn't be</i>
<i> able to get back.</i>

30:35.134 --> 30:36.500
There is no other way.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.169
-No. I can have Max...
<i> -No, there's no time...</i>

30:39.171 --> 30:41.004
Kara, listen to me.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.973
I was sent to protect earth

30:42.975 --> 30:44.274
and that's what I'm gonna do.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.845
<i> I need you</i>
<i> to promise me something.</i>

30:47.847 --> 30:50.147
I need you to promise me

30:50.149 --> 30:52.616
that when you find Jeremiah,

30:54.520 --> 30:55.652
you'll tell him

30:55.654 --> 30:57.654
that I never stopped
wearing the glasses.

30:59.992 --> 31:04.828
He needs to know
that you and Eliza
gave me a great life.

31:04.830 --> 31:09.299
A life I never thought
I'd be able to find
outside of Krypton.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.669
<i> He needs to know that,</i>

31:13.906 --> 31:15.572
that everything good I did,

31:18.043 --> 31:20.844
it came from you
being my sister.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.480
You taught me, Kara.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.048
<i> I want you</i>
<i> to have a good life.</i>

31:25.050 --> 31:27.317
<i> I want you to find love</i>
<i> and be happy.</i>

31:27.319 --> 31:29.253
I want you to
do all the things

31:29.255 --> 31:31.588
that being my sister
kept you from doing.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.090
Kara...

31:33.092 --> 31:35.058
<i> Promise me.</i>

31:35.060 --> 31:36.326
(Sobbing)

31:39.565 --> 31:41.198
I can't.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.367
I need you need you
to promise me, Alex.
There isn't much time.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.437
I promise. (Sniffles)

31:49.308 --> 31:50.841
Good. Okay.

31:51.644 --> 31:52.776
I have to go now.

31:59.852 --> 32:01.184
I love you, Kara.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.354
I love you.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.824
Kara?

32:10.062 --> 32:11.328
Kara?

32:16.702 --> 32:18.368
(Metal creaking)

32:26.845 --> 32:28.345
(Grunting loudly)

33:39.018 --> 33:40.951
(ekg machine beeping)

33:41.954 --> 33:43.887
(Breathes deeply)

33:50.229 --> 33:51.595
(Groans)

33:54.133 --> 33:55.399
What happened?

33:56.402 --> 33:58.602
You saved the world.

33:58.604 --> 34:01.705
And then I saved you
with your pod.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.675
You're not the only
badass in the family.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.344
(Both laugh)

34:08.814 --> 34:09.880
And, uh...

34:12.084 --> 34:14.551
This belongs to you.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.754
I think your mother
would've really appreciated
my piloting skills.

34:20.926 --> 34:24.361
There are a lot of
people out there waiting
to say thank you.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.364
(Applause)

34:38.177 --> 34:39.443
Ten-hut!

34:42.047 --> 34:44.347
I've spoken with
the president.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.616
She's indebted
to you, Supergirl.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.418
As am I.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.788
She's also aware of the
remarkable courage

34:51.790 --> 34:54.491
you demonstrated,
j'onn j'onzz.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.493
She's granting you
a full pardon

34:56.495 --> 34:58.662
and reinstating you
as director of the deo.

35:04.470 --> 35:09.673
In my absence, major Lane has
performed her duty as director
with expertise and integrity.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.610
And if there's one thing
I've learned in my lifetimes,

35:13.612 --> 35:16.680
it's that leaders
are stronger working together.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.015
From now on, we're
all on the same team,

35:19.017 --> 35:20.383
no more secrets.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.221
<i> Secrets protect no one.</i>

35:24.223 --> 35:27.124
<i> They only undermine what</i>
<i> we're striving to accomplish,</i>

35:30.896 --> 35:33.063
<i> peace.</i>

35:33.065 --> 35:36.266
<i> And even though we have</i>
<i> defeated non and myriad,</i>

35:36.268 --> 35:37.701
<i> evil still persists</i>

35:39.338 --> 35:41.037
and there are ever more
dangers that we face.

35:42.441 --> 35:46.476
Our enemies remain
at home, abroad

35:46.478 --> 35:48.912
and in the skies
beyond our world.

36:04.796 --> 36:05.862
(Chuckles)

36:16.241 --> 36:17.440
What...

36:17.442 --> 36:19.042
-What is this?
-Banker's box.

36:19.044 --> 36:21.144
Typically used to carry
one's meager possessions

36:21.146 --> 36:24.147
as they're being escorted
to the elevator in disgrace.

36:24.149 --> 36:26.850
Or by force, if necessary.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.186
-What are you doing?
-Helping you pack.

36:29.188 --> 36:30.453
My...

36:32.224 --> 36:33.990
Ms. Grant, whatever I did,

36:33.992 --> 36:36.993
whatever you think I did,
i can explain.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.332
(Sighs)

36:42.334 --> 36:44.434
-Kara: What is this?
-(Exhales)

36:44.436 --> 36:48.171
This is your new office.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.707
You're not firing me?

36:50.709 --> 36:53.009
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm promoting you.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.512
Ker-rah, for the
last two years,

36:55.514 --> 36:59.616
you have done
nothing but arrange
my travel perfectly

36:59.618 --> 37:01.918
and manage
my schedule flawlessly.

37:01.920 --> 37:07.924
You have become the best
assistant I have ever had.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.660
And that is why
i have to give you up.

37:14.533 --> 37:15.966
What am I...

37:18.170 --> 37:19.803
What do you want me to do?

37:19.805 --> 37:22.939
Well, I want you to find me
a new assistant, for starters

37:22.941 --> 37:25.609
and then I want you
to take a few days,

37:25.611 --> 37:28.378
I want you to think about
what you want,

37:28.380 --> 37:30.480
and then

37:30.482 --> 37:33.016
I'll think about what
you might have to offer,

37:33.018 --> 37:34.551
and then we'll talk.

37:34.553 --> 37:37.420
Really? Anything I want?

37:37.422 --> 37:39.489
Well, within reason.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.424
And the money
won't be much different,

37:41.426 --> 37:43.193
or any different,

37:43.195 --> 37:46.963
but this is a step
up for you, ker-rah.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.900
This is your end of
<i> working girl</i> moment.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.970
And if you take
advantage of it,

37:53.972 --> 37:56.606
I really believe that you
can change the world.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.244
-Ms. Grant.
-Hmm?

38:03.215 --> 38:05.782
The end of <i> working girl</i>
always makes me cry.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.118
Um...

38:09.354 --> 38:10.654
Me too.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.992
(Exhales)

38:15.994 --> 38:19.596
If you work hard
there might be
a window in your future,

38:20.599 --> 38:21.898
Kara.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.883
Okay, do the forks go
on the left or the right,
i can never remember.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.584
Forks on the left,
knives on the right.

38:41.586 --> 38:42.886
It's the way you eat.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.120
How would I know that?

38:44.122 --> 38:46.122
I... I eat with my fork
in my right hand.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.291
That's because you were
raised by wolves.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.227
Six, seven...
Hey, you guys, um,

38:51.229 --> 38:54.364
we have, we have
one extra setting.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.633
No, no, leave that one there.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.234
It's for Jeremiah.

38:58.236 --> 39:01.204
-For when he comes back.
-Alex: He will, mom.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.673
I give you my word.
We're gonna find
project cadmus,

39:03.675 --> 39:05.709
-we're gonna bring him home.
-Together.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.114
Hey, Kara, can I borrow
you for a second?

39:13.385 --> 39:15.285
(Clears throat) So,

39:15.287 --> 39:18.188
I've taken a lot
of photos of Supergirl

39:18.190 --> 39:19.989
and I think this one
is really special.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.991
That's so sweet.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.299
Ta da.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.101
Oh.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.137
I'm squinting.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.706
No, you're smiling
with your eyes.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.942
Like you are now.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.777
It's what happens
when you're happy.

39:42.381 --> 39:43.947
Yeah, I am happy.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.151
-Thank you.
-Of course.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.963
Alex: Great, Kara,
do the champagne trick!

39:59.965 --> 40:01.965
Come on, come on, come on.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.433
Alex: It's so cool.
Winn: Do the trick.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.734
Alex: Come here, come here.
Winn: Do the trick.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.002
(All chuckling)

40:06.872 --> 40:10.073
Go, go, go. Three, two, one!

40:10.075 --> 40:11.674
(All cheer)

40:17.616 --> 40:19.716
-Let's have a toast.
-James: All right.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.422
-To Supergirl.
-No, no. Wait, wait.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.557
To family.

40:27.559 --> 40:28.958
Love bonds us all.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.095
All: To family!

40:32.731 --> 40:34.197
(Crashing)

40:34.199 --> 40:35.265
What was that?

40:38.470 --> 40:39.869
Nothing good.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.482
That pod.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.284
It's identical to mine.

40:54.286 --> 40:55.885
It's from Krypton.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.422
J'onn j'onzz:
Supergirl, be careful.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.059
You don't know
what's in there.

41:06.665 --> 41:07.931
(Grunts)

41:11.803 --> 41:13.236
Oh, my god.
