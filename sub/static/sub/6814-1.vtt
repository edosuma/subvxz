02:41.828 --> 02:43.250
(CLUCKING)

02:43.330 --> 02:47.210
Now, boy, I've told you
time and again. Now, look at me.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.251
There's no horsin' around

02:48.335 --> 02:50.087
when the train's comin' in.
You hear me?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.844
- Now, go on. Get away.
-(WHISTLE BLOWING)

02:55.592 --> 02:58.186
- Looks like she's on time.
-That she is.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.461
CONDUCTOR: Harrington!

03:39.761 --> 03:41.229
Oh, let me help you
with that, little girl.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.806
- Thank you.
-Watch your step.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.231
There you are, little girl.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.862
Now, I have to go to the store.
You go get the luggage.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.663
Be careful of the fresh eggs.
They're wrapped in paper.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.574
- Yes, dear.
-Oh, Ben?

04:00.657 --> 04:01.658
Yes, dear?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.919
Write a letter to the
president of this railroad.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.838
There were men smoking in the
parlor car. Disgraceful!

04:06.913 --> 04:09.257
- I've taken his number.
-Yes, dear.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.676
- Miss Pollyanna?
-Yes. Aunt Polly?

04:15.714 --> 04:17.808
No, I'm Nancy.
I work for your aunt,

04:17.841 --> 04:19.093
and I came here to fetch you.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.348
Oh. How do you do?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.687
This is Mr. Thomas,
the gardener.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.349
- How do you do?
-Hello, young lady.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.351
Oh, no, no, no!
Thomas will take that for you.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.772
Put it in the back seat.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Tarbell.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.026
Is that
Jenny Harrington's child?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.489
Yes, it is.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.575
Doesn't look a thing
like any of the Harringtons.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.574
- What's your name, girl?
-NANCY: Speak up.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.829
Pollyanna Whittier, ma'am.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.378
Well, you're a very
fortunate little girl.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.038
Most children who have
lost their parents

04:48.079 --> 04:49.205
would end up in an orphanage.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.884
You know that, don't you?

04:52.959 --> 04:53.960
Yes, ma'am.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.887
Well, thank your lucky stars

04:55.962 --> 04:58.556
for such a good woman
<i>as</i> your aunt taking you in.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.717
Yes, ma'am.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.224
Yes, well, see that you're
properly appreciative,

05:03.303 --> 05:04.771
and don't cause any trouble.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.398
Children really
never realize...

05:06.431 --> 05:08.354
- Ed?
-Uncle Karl!

05:08.391 --> 05:09.859
- Much too long.
-it's good to see you.

05:09.893 --> 05:10.940
Oh, same here.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.020
How's everything
at the house?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.063
Just fine.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.238
He's come back.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.409
Wait till Polly Harrington
hears about this.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.089
Right up here in
the back seat, honey.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.381
There you are.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.469
Nancy, what are you
staring at?

05:41.258 --> 05:44.011
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all, sir.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.667
THOMAS: Think she'll want the car?

06:11.746 --> 06:13.168
I don't know if she
wants the car or not.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.625
You'll have to
ask her yourself.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.024
Your aunt's waiting
for you, miss.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.648
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day!

06:59.628 --> 07:01.847
Oh, Mr. Thomas,
please put that here.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.016
All right, Nancy. All right.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.140
You wait here, miss,
and don't touch anything.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.272
- Do you understand?
-Yes, ma'am.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.771
MAN: Well, we had, uh, Matthew.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.152
Mark last week.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.980
But Isaiah has some
very good passages.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.064
Isaiah?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.779
Yes, that's more
what I had in mind.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.985
Yes, Isaiah has some
very good passages.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.069
What is it, Nancy?

08:06.111 --> 08:07.909
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
The little girl is here.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.748
All right. Show her in.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.247
What you've been waiting for.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.246
About the sermon, Reverend.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.206
Yes.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.922
Now, the transiency of life.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.762
That fleeting,
ephemeral vapor,

08:28.800 --> 08:31.849
it appeareth and it vanisheth.
James, the New Testament.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.895
The perishability
of our mortal bodies.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.275
You want me to weave a theme
of this into my sermon?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.273
Well, let me tell you
what my father said to Reverend Moffet.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.477
Yes, what did he say?

08:40.562 --> 08:42.188
He said that you only
have the congregation

08:42.272 --> 08:44.274
for one short hour a week.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.109
And there are six long days
of mischief

08:46.151 --> 08:47.619
for them before
you get them again.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.531
Ah-ha! I see your point.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.073
Strike hard on Sunday

08:52.115 --> 08:53.367
the excessiveness
of God's wrath,

08:53.450 --> 08:55.327
and hope they carry it with
them a few days into the week.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.629
- Exactly what I mean.
-Oh, yes, yes.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.132
Well, come in, young lady.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.472
Let's meet
each other properly.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.518
I'm your Aunt Polly.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.058
How do you do?

09:18.141 --> 09:20.439
This is the pastor
of our church, Reverend Ford.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.312
How do you do?

09:23.271 --> 09:24.693
Well, there's
a family resemblance.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.991
She looks very much
like her mother.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.945
Mother always used to say
I look like you.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.665
Would you be good enough
to stand erect...

09:34.157 --> 09:35.659
And in a proper manner,
please?

09:36.951 --> 09:37.998
(CHUCKLING)

09:38.078 --> 09:40.547
And where in the world
did you get that dress?

09:43.208 --> 09:45.006
It came in
the missionary barrels.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.088
Missionary barrels?

09:48.171 --> 09:49.764
Yes,
her father was a minister.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.931
- Oh.
-As a matter of fact,

09:51.007 --> 09:53.430
he was a missionary in
the British West Indies.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.511
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.852
Pollyanna,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.436
this is going to be
your new home,

10:00.683 --> 10:02.560
and I hope you'll be
very happy with me.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.567
I'm very sorry about
the dress, Aunt Polly.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.033
My father said it was
a size too big,

10:13.071 --> 10:14.448
but that I should
be glad it wasn't

10:14.531 --> 10:16.204
a pair of boy's trousers.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.620
(CHUCKLING) Well, that's hardly
anything to be glad about.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.464
Well, my father always
used to say that people...

10:22.539 --> 10:24.883
Yes, well, never mind
what your father used to say.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.965
Supper is at 6:00 sharp.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.046
And no one is ever late
for meals at this house.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.468
Yes, ma'am.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.095
Nancy will show
you your room.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.558
I'm very glad
you sent for me, Aunt Polly.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.780
- Your home is very lovely.
-Well, thank you.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.081
It must make you awfully glad.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.908
Glad?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.456
That you're so very rich.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.162
(REVEREND FORD
CLEARING THROAT)

11:02.245 --> 11:04.339
(COUGHING)

11:09.419 --> 11:10.591
NANCY: Honestly!

11:12.046 --> 11:13.764
Did I say something wrong?

11:13.798 --> 11:16.096
Well, let's just say there are
about sixty-eleven things

11:16.176 --> 11:17.598
you could have said
besides that.

11:18.636 --> 11:22.061
I run a clean kitchen.
No shenanigans in here.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.566
And you clean up
after yourself, you hear me?

11:23.975 --> 11:25.101
Yes, ma'am.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.773
- You sure it was Doc Chilton?
-Mrs. Tarbell saw him first.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.109
Coming back after
all these years.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.861
D-does she know yet?

11:33.943 --> 11:36.162
Old blabbermouth Tarbell
will see to that.

11:36.905 --> 11:37.906
Now, mind what you're doing,

11:37.947 --> 11:40.245
and don't spill your milk.
Now, come along.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.455
And you hurry up and
change your clothes

11:41.534 --> 11:42.660
and get back here.
I need your help.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.745
All right, all right.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.379
And if you see Angelica,
tell her to come down here too.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.002
- Okay.
-Leaving me all alone here.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.047
I'm very pleased to have
met you, Mrs. Lagerlof.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.719
- Mmm.
-Now come along.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.440
Hello.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.737
What's his name, please?

12:09.979 --> 12:12.357
His name happens
to be Elizabeth.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.364
Oh, you're a girl.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.908
You're lovely.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.323
Now, leave her alone
and come along.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.586
H-how do
I address you, please?

12:24.661 --> 12:26.709
Well, just call me Nancy,
same as everybody else.

12:27.330 --> 12:30.129
Oh, and this is Angelica.
She's the upstairs maid.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.960
- How do you do?
-(MUMBLING)

12:32.001 --> 12:34.595
Psst! Psst! At the back porch.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.218
- You know who.
-Now?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.637
Oh, for heaven's sake.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.848
Oh, Angie, would you show
her to her room, please?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.304
Oh, I still have two rooms
left to do. I can't...

12:42.345 --> 12:44.018
I'll help you with the
bedrooms in the morning.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.932
- Oh, all right. Just this once.
-Thanks.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.863
Will you get out of here?
Come on! Hurry up!

12:52.897 --> 12:54.695
I've got work to do.
Get up to your room.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.111
I turn my back for one moment,
and what do you do?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.195
You disappear.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.534
- Now, don't spill that milk.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.956
Just got through cleaning up
this hall.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.032
Yes, ma'am.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.016
What are you doing now?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.392
Who lives in all these?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.936
There's no one lives in them.
They're just there.

13:24.012 --> 13:27.061
- What for?
-That's what being wealthy is.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.897
You sure are
a question-asker, aren't you?

13:29.934 --> 13:31.231
Now, hurry up.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.912
Come on, come on.
Don't dawdle.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.683
- Well, what's the matter?
-Nothing.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.763
Oh, stuffy.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.519
Not much of a room, is it?

14:10.141 --> 14:11.768
But it's my own, anyway.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.777
I'm glad of that.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.614
Ooh, and the bed's soft!

14:22.028 --> 14:23.951
And it's got a lovely window.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.800
Who's that man
down there with Nancy?

14:46.636 --> 14:47.933
None of your business.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.100
Just make sure you're
dressed in time for dinner.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.317
You'd think she'd do better
than this for her own niece.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.131
Almighty God,
we thank Thee for Thy bounty.

15:15.164 --> 15:18.008
Grant unto us the grace ever
to live in dread of Thee.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.507
And bless this food
unto our nourishment,

15:20.545 --> 15:23.515
that it may strengthen us
to do Thy will in all things.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.674
Amen.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.198
(GASPS)
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.036
Nancy, would you bring
another glass of milk, please?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.537
Yes, ma'am.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.217
M-my clumsy old hand.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.923
Well, now,
there's no harm done.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.548
Did you find your room
satisfactory?

16:06.340 --> 16:08.058
Oh, yes. It's very nice.
Thank you.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.891
You hadn't mentioned it,
so I just wondered.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.558
I've never had a whole
room to myself before.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.070
I must be higher
up in the house than anyone, aren't I?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.904
Well, I'm not used to
children's noises around the house,

16:23.983 --> 16:27.283
and that's the reason
I chose that one.

16:27.737 --> 16:31.116
Oh, I'm... I love it!
I really do.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.412
Really.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.588
Aunt Polly?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.384
Do you ever have
steak and ice cream?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.892
Are you complaining
about the food?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.353
Oh, no. It's delicious!

16:57.016 --> 16:58.359
I just wondered.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.780
I love steak.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.574
Father always used to say

17:05.608 --> 17:08.111
that if we ever had
the money you have,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.873
we'd have steak and ice
cream three times every day.

17:13.281 --> 17:14.499
Pollyanna,
I think we ought to get

17:14.575 --> 17:16.122
one thing straight right now.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.210
I don't want you
constantly quoting

17:19.288 --> 17:20.710
what your father used to say.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.335
Do you understand?

17:31.217 --> 17:32.389
Nancy?

17:32.802 --> 17:35.305
I thought I made myself clear
about gentlemen callers.

17:35.805 --> 17:36.806
Ma'am?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.812
Now, don't pretend
you don't understand me.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.943
I saw you and George Dodds
out in the summer house.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.317
George has been every inch a
gentleman with me,

17:43.354 --> 17:44.731
-and it's not <i>as</i> if...
- We won't discuss it.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.903
If you want to
remain on my staff,

17:46.983 --> 17:48.451
I don't want you to
see him anymore.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.240
Do you understand?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.367
Yes, ma'am.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.204
This is no concern of yours.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.957
You can finish
your supper, Pollyanna.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.641
In the fall, I'll introduce
you to Mr. Bainbridge.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.051
He's the principal
of our school,

18:13.134 --> 18:14.556
and he'll decide
what grade you're to be in.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.436
Pollyanna, I think
we should talk about you

18:19.515 --> 18:21.017
and your position
in this community.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.732
Do you know why
it's called Harrington Town?

18:24.353 --> 18:27.106
My mother said it was named
after my grandfather.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.190
That's right.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.655
And everyone in
this town looks to us

18:30.693 --> 18:32.036
to set a good example,

18:32.069 --> 18:34.242
in the way
we conduct ourselves,

18:34.322 --> 18:36.074
in our duties and manners,

18:36.741 --> 18:38.539
in what we think,
and even what we say.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.498
So, we must be good examples

18:40.536 --> 18:42.288
for everyone in
everything we do.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.715
- Is that clear?
-Yes, Aunt Polly.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.713
Just remember
our family position,

18:46.792 --> 18:49.295
and conduct yourself
properly and modestly.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.215
Oh.
You mean what I said before?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.512
I understand that now.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.810
I'll never say that again.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.604
You understand what?

18:59.221 --> 19:00.473
About the money.

19:00.973 --> 19:05.444
I'm not supposed to be glad
we're so very rich. Huh?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.317
Well, um, I think
it's time for you

19:10.399 --> 19:11.616
to get ready for bed,
young lady.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.118
May I kiss you good night?

19:20.368 --> 19:22.041
- Please?
-What?

19:23.579 --> 19:24.626
Kiss you?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.932
Mmm, I love you, Aunt Polly.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.855
Uh, uh, just a moment, please.
Come back here.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.358
Turn around once.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.116
That dress is disgraceful.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.201
Tomorrow we'll go into town

19:54.276 --> 19:55.994
and get you some
decent clothes.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.282
Store-bought?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.617
But of course. Where else
would we get them?

20:02.451 --> 20:06.456
Out of an actual store?
New clothes?

20:06.956 --> 20:09.880
You're a Harrington now,
and I want you to look like one.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.589
<i>Yoo-hod.!</i>

20:12.795 --> 20:14.138
Pollyanna!

20:15.548 --> 20:17.550
Walk up the stairs
like a lady, please.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.072
Store-bought clothes.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.909
What do you think
of that, Elizabeth?

20:40.990 --> 20:43.118
I wonder if she meant
new petticoats too.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.167
And new garters
and stockings and underpants.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.010
Don't tell anyone,

20:55.004 --> 20:57.473
but it's wonderful
to be so rich, isn't it?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.178
(RINGING)

21:03.012 --> 21:04.013
(INAUDIBLE)

22:46.031 --> 22:48.784
All right. I'll put most of
them on the front seat.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.123
(CAR BELL RINGING)

22:50.202 --> 22:51.795
Move that yellow one, Thomas.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.623
No, not here.
That's the good one.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.882
Nancy, something's come up.
I'm going with Mrs. Tarbell.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.467
Would you please take
Pollyanna home?

23:04.508 --> 23:05.509
Yes, madam.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.937
Oh, I'll take that box,
Pollyanna.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.432
Now, get into the car, miss.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.397
(CAR BELL RINGING)

23:15.936 --> 23:17.984
Oh, Pollyanna, will you
please get into the car?

23:18.022 --> 23:19.399
We've simply got to get home.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.824
-(GROWLING)
-Oh!

23:25.029 --> 23:26.656
George, stop it!

23:30.701 --> 23:35.002
Oh, Pollyanna, you don't
know my cousin Fred, do you?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.134
Your cousin Fred?

23:39.168 --> 23:42.297
This is Pollyanna Whittier,
Miss Harrington's niece.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.723
The one who's come
to live with her?

23:44.798 --> 23:48.974
Oh. Oh, that one.
Hello, Pollyanna. How are ya, honey?

23:49.553 --> 23:50.600
- Fine, thank you.
-Good.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.355
Well, uh, how about this?

23:55.392 --> 23:57.019
Running into you
after all these...

23:57.102 --> 23:58.649
What's it been, six years?

23:58.687 --> 24:01.281
- Say, how's your ma and pa?
-Well, they're just fine.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.735
You know, Pollyanna, I don't
take too much to relatives,

24:04.401 --> 24:08.326
but this girl here, she was
always just like a sister to me.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.538
I tell ya, I love this cousin.

24:11.575 --> 24:12.918
Will you cut it out?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.213
Uh-huh. Well, look, uh,

24:20.250 --> 24:21.593
what are you girls doing?

24:21.669 --> 24:22.716
How'd you like to go
down the street

24:22.753 --> 24:24.596
and get a great big
dish of ice cream, huh?

24:25.339 --> 24:27.182
- Oh...
-No, that's a rotten idea.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.843
She probably hates ice
cream, doesn't she?

24:28.926 --> 24:30.052
Oh, probably.

24:30.094 --> 24:33.564
- Who me? Oh, no, I love it!
-Really?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.725
You do? Well, now,
isn't that astounding?

24:35.808 --> 24:38.106
How'd you ever develop
a taste for that awful stuff?

24:38.185 --> 24:40.904
Oh, no, really!
I really do love it.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.565
Well, I know
a wonderful place.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.241
Come on, girls.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.204
Follow old cousin Fred to the
land of strawberry frappe.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.706
Unless you'd rather go down
the street and have a beer.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.912
- You're funny.
-(LAUGHING)

24:54.618 --> 24:57.041
(ALL CLAMORING)

25:06.922 --> 25:09.675
MAN: Hey, you two get down
off that truck right now!

25:09.758 --> 25:10.805
How many times I told you to

25:10.884 --> 25:12.352
keep away from
the fire engine?

25:14.054 --> 25:16.603
(ALL LAUGHING AND SCREAMING)

25:17.099 --> 25:20.103
Jimmy Bean, I'm not gonna tell
you again. Get off that ladder.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.067
You see, right up there,
under the eaves.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.233
Well, just beyond the window
there is where it first...

25:25.274 --> 25:27.527
- How'd it happen?
-Oh, the pipe's busted, Mayor.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.782
Both them boilers
went up at the same time,

25:29.862 --> 25:32.206
and before we knew it,
we was up to our necks in water.

25:32.281 --> 25:34.579
- Mr. Geary!
-Uh, comin'. Excuse me.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.786
Well, the children
are safe, thank goodness.

25:36.952 --> 25:37.953
I warned you about this

25:38.037 --> 25:39.289
and told you we should
do something!

25:39.455 --> 25:40.627
Now, perhaps, you'll listen.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.799
I've asked everyone
to meet at my house,

25:42.833 --> 25:44.301
and we'll discuss this calmly.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.136
A fine orphanage this is.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.804
Water pipes busting
all over the place.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.096
Oh, Dr. Chilton.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.357
Doctor, could you have a look
at Mr. Geary's arm, please?

25:58.432 --> 26:00.105
Oh, just scalded it a bit.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.519
Of course.
ls there a dispensary here?

26:01.602 --> 26:02.649
Yes, Doctor. This way.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.874
I wonder what's going on.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.832
Listen, miss, before we go in,

26:22.873 --> 26:25.001
it might be just as well
not to mention

26:25.042 --> 26:27.090
about the ice cream
to your aunt.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.132
My father told me
never to tell a lie.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.351
Pollyanna.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.934
I didn't mean to tell a lie.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.273
But there's no reason to
bring up the subject

26:40.349 --> 26:41.566
if it isn't mentioned.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.519
I mean,
about cousin Fred and all.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.980
I like your cousin Fred
very much.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.568
Oh, he's all right, I guess.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.576
He's very handsome,
and he has a nice smile.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.076
But there's something sort of,

26:55.864 --> 26:58.117
I don't know, funny about him.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.203
What do you mean, funny?

27:03.122 --> 27:05.250
I know what it is!
It's his name.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.376
He doesn't look
at all like a Fred.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.215
What?

27:09.253 --> 27:11.722
He looks more like
a George to me.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.679
Pollyanna, wait a minute.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.315
Pollyanna, I told you
to come directly home.

27:26.395 --> 27:27.442
I know, Aunt Polly, but...

27:27.521 --> 27:29.068
When I tell you to do
something, you must do it.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.525
There are rules...

27:30.566 --> 27:32.534
Nancy, where have you two been?
It's almost 1:00.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.321
Well, um, you see, ma'am...

27:35.404 --> 27:37.406
Have you been carrying on
with George Dodds again?

27:39.283 --> 27:41.035
Oh, it was my fault,
Aunt Polly.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.121
What do you mean, your fault?

27:45.747 --> 27:48.842
Well, I-l just dawdled so.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.304
It was the excitement
of the new dress, I suppose.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.932
Polly, before Karl Warren
gets here, we must talk.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.847
POLLY: Oh, I suppose you're right.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.265
Nancy?

28:01.889 --> 28:04.108
Nancy, get into your uniform
and help with the luncheon.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.313
Yes, ma'am.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.028
And this is no place
for you, young lady.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.525
We have lots to do,
so run along.

28:09.605 --> 28:10.606
Yes, Aunt Polly.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.112
I'm sorry to start your
vacation off like this, Ed,

28:13.192 --> 28:14.284
but this won't take long.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.615
Don't worry about me,
Uncle Karl.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.537
- I'll just wait out here.
-Fine, fine.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.704
POLLY: Oh, Frieda, Bessie,

28:21.783 --> 28:23.376
they're waiting for you
in the conservatory.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.829
Right in there, ladies.

28:26.955 --> 28:30.129
Why, Edmond,
this is a surprise.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.883
Well, if it isn't young
Dr. Chilton.

28:33.962 --> 28:34.963
Mrs. Tarbell.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.139
I'll see if
everyone's ready for you, Polly.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.178
Thank you.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.976
It's nice to see you again.

28:44.890 --> 28:45.937
Are you just visiting?

28:46.433 --> 28:48.231
EDMOND: Well,
I thought it was time for a vacation.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.607
The first one in five years.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.651
I'm just
waiting here for Karl.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.823
I won't be
in the way here, I hope.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.492
No, no. Of course not.

28:57.945 --> 29:02.121
Seems strange,
being back here again like this.

29:04.326 --> 29:07.000
MRS. TARBELL: Polly,
they're all ready for you.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.339
I'll be right there.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.130
Why don't you come in
and join us?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.887
No, I'd rather not butt in.
I'll wait here.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.263
Well, they're waiting for me.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.685
Go ahead. I'll be fine here.

29:34.731 --> 29:35.778
Hi, Nancy.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.609
Hi.
You better get out of here.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.161
Oh, I'm all right.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.989
(MURMURING)

29:48.745 --> 29:50.167
MRS. TARBELL: It should be
parliamentary procedure.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.252
Same as it always is.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.332
Well, for once,
let's have facts.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.047
We've always observed
regular procedure.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.127
Oh, bunkum!

29:55.210 --> 29:56.382
KARL: We're here because
of an emergency.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.421
-(SNEEZING)
-POLLY: Everybody will be

29:57.504 --> 29:58.505
talking at the same time.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.015
MRS. TARBELL: Exactly.
They'll all be standing up

30:00.048 --> 30:01.265
trying to get the floor.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.518
(GASPS)

30:03.552 --> 30:05.225
- Hello.
-Hello.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.723
Is this the town meeting?

30:07.764 --> 30:09.766
Oh, no. It's in there.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.898
In the conservatory,
for heaven's sake.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.777
Oh. Are you a member of
the ladies' aid group?

30:15.856 --> 30:16.857
Oh, no.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.241
I'm just a child.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.194
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.829
- Shh.
-What's your name?

30:22.904 --> 30:24.531
Pollyanna Whittier.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.668
That's my aunt over there,
the pretty one.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.087
This is her house,
and I live with her.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.543
(ARGUING CONTINUING)

30:32.581 --> 30:33.924
- Shh.
-Shh.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.001
POLLY: Wait just a moment,
everybody.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.381
We'll compromise.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.046
We'll go to the immediate
problems first.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.088
KARL: Good

30:40.881 --> 30:44.385
POLLY: Amelia, wouldn't you like
to hear what Karl has to say?

30:45.594 --> 30:47.562
All I'm saying
is that it's time

30:47.596 --> 30:49.439
we took some pride
in that orphanage,

30:49.514 --> 30:51.733
and put up a decent,
presentable building

30:51.767 --> 30:52.984
that we could all be proud of.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.104
That's all I'm saying.

30:55.145 --> 30:58.240
And I've been saying it for
three and a half long years!

30:58.565 --> 31:01.159
MRS. TARBELL: See, he's
always trying to get the floor.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.363
KARL: No, I'm not at all.

31:04.446 --> 31:05.823

31:05.906 --> 31:06.998
KARL: No, I'm not!

31:08.325 --> 31:09.577
REVEREND FORD: H-here, now...

31:10.035 --> 31:11.662
MRS. TARBELL: Polly,
he's completely out of line

31:11.745 --> 31:12.746
on the whole thing.

31:13.121 --> 31:16.125
REVEREND FORD: Here now,
if we'd all be a little more quiet,

31:16.833 --> 31:18.551
cooperative, orderly.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.470
If we'd all
stop shouting and cooperate...

31:20.504 --> 31:22.472
There is nothing wrong
with that building!

31:23.048 --> 31:24.595
All it needs is new plumbing.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.309
Today the plumbing,
tomorrow the roof

31:26.343 --> 31:27.720
and the Lord knows what...

31:28.387 --> 31:29.809
Excuse me, Reverend.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.890
Who knows what's
gonna happen next?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.316
POLLY: You were very happy
when my father

31:33.350 --> 31:34.818
donated the building
to the town.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.728
KARL: Oh, for Pete's sake,
Polly Harrington,

31:36.812 --> 31:37.813
listen to reason!

31:38.146 --> 31:40.148
It's a dilapidated old relic!

31:40.941 --> 31:42.693
The dining hall,
the dispensary.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.829
Even my nephew,
Dr. Chilton there, he noticed that.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.328
Ed, tell them what you said.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.828
Well, I don't think
I should say anything.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.839
No, no, now, tell them what
you said. I want them to hear it.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.258
Well, I got a look
at the dispensary

31:58.333 --> 31:59.835
when I fixed Mr. Geary's arm,

32:01.128 --> 32:03.222
and I mentioned it seemed
a little inadequate

32:03.296 --> 32:04.297
for 32 children.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.100
There you are.
Now you've heard it.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.687
We all thank you
for your interest, Edmond,

32:10.762 --> 32:12.059
but it's an equipment problem.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.808
We're talking about
Harrington House,

32:14.891 --> 32:16.359
which is a landmark
in this town,

32:16.435 --> 32:18.688
and I intend to see
that it stays that way.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.902
KARL: We'll spend more
to repair that old building

32:20.981 --> 32:22.358
than to put up a new one.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.943
It won't cost this town
one cent!

32:24.526 --> 32:26.620
My father donated the building
to the town,

32:27.195 --> 32:29.664
and I will stand the cost
of the pipes or the plumbing

32:29.698 --> 32:31.541
or whatever it is
that's necessary.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.795
It's my duty,
and I will not shirk it.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.379
I suppose there's
no one of you out there

32:40.459 --> 32:42.553
that has the gumption
to say what you think.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.721
Is there?

32:45.380 --> 32:46.381
What about you, Reverend?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.887
You're a man of influence
in this community.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.060

-No, no, no.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.730

sides in these matters.

32:54.556 --> 32:57.935
Oh, that's comfortable.
Ben, speak up. Come on.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.817
Oh, Karl.

Well, say something!

33:10.030 --> 33:11.907
We do have other
business to discuss.

33:12.032 --> 33:15.036
- That is if you've finished, Karl.
-Oh, yes, I've finished.

There's your
whole town council

33:20.790 --> 33:22.292
and your whole city

33:22.584 --> 33:24.586
You certainly don't need me as
mayor around here

33:24.669 --> 33:25.761

Polly Harrington

33:25.837 --> 33:26.884

33:41.645 --> 33:43.113
If you ask me, Reverend Ford

33:43.146 --> 33:45.615
should have taken sides
with Mayor Warren.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.492
He had the chance,
and what'd he do?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.069
Said he never takes sides.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.953
Stop sticking your nose
into their business

33:50.987 --> 33:52.614
and get these
sherbet glasses out there.

33:52.656 --> 33:53.703
We're out of spoons.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.331

aren't you?

could use this for your room.

spilling the beans

- About cousin Fred, you mean?
-Mm-hmm.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.395
-Isn't he handsome?
-I knew it all the time.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.643
- You did? How did you know?
-It was easy.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.478
I saw you holding hands
under the table.

better to do

34:21.518 --> 34:23.485

Well,
we're just talking, Tillie.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.694
Well, talk on your own time.

to Aunt Polly?

Well, you might say they used
to be friends... Sort of.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.885
Do you think he's gonna
marry Aunt Polly?

34:50.964 --> 34:52.306
Who's gonna marry her?

34:52.507 --> 34:54.225
She means Dr. Chilton.

Oh, I am glad. I think
everyone should be married.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.360

when you do marry George,

35:12.152 --> 35:14.154
Aunt Polly will see how
happy you are,

35:14.195 --> 35:16.323

to get married herself, then.

Glad this, glad that.

about everything?

35:19.868 --> 35:20.960
What's the matter
with you, anyway?

35:21.036 --> 35:23.960
Oh, lay off her, Angie.
She's not hurting you.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.086
Oh, the way she goes on.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.172

Oh, I love roast chicken!
I'm glad tomorrow's Sunday.

Ah, wait till tomorrow.
You won't be so glad.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.023
at the finish was
very effective.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.733
- Didn't you, Mrs. Ford?
-Yes.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.367
L, um... (CLEARING THROAT)

42:50.443 --> 42:51.695
Sometimes wonder
whether it's necessary

42:51.778 --> 42:54.247
to talk so furiously
at them, though.

42:54.322 --> 42:57.166
REVEREND FORD: Dear, Isaiah,
Jeremiah and Ezekiel

42:57.241 --> 43:00.120
all recorded
with flaming pens and power.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.663
I can't deliver the message
with syrup.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.043
Of course not.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.339
Your voice is God's instrument

43:04.373 --> 43:05.499
and should be
used accordingly.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.675
Well, we try our best.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.428
What'd <i>I</i> tell ya?

43:09.712 --> 43:13.307
He sure sermonizes
something fierce, doesn't he?

43:13.341 --> 43:16.720
Brimstone and damnation
on top of ham and eggs!

43:16.803 --> 43:18.521
The one day a week
we have off.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.189
I hate Sundays.

43:20.348 --> 43:21.816
TILLIE: Ooh,
I just hate them!

43:21.849 --> 43:23.943
Breakfast still a hot ball
in our stomachs,

43:24.018 --> 43:26.521
and him chewing our ears off
from that pulpit!

43:26.604 --> 43:29.107
We get to have roast chicken,
though. I'm glad of that.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.116
Are you gonna start
that all over again?

43:31.192 --> 43:32.944
Glad this, glad that.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.197
What is all this "glad"
business you talk about?

43:38.074 --> 43:40.543
Oh, just a game I play.

43:40.576 --> 43:41.919
What kind of a game?

43:44.038 --> 43:45.335
A game my father taught me.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.213
Helps sometimes.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.628
Helps what?

43:51.212 --> 43:52.885
When things aren't
going so well.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.265
- That Reverend!
-Huh.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.888
Away from the peas! Go away.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.016
Folks just hate the coming of
Sunday because of him.

43:59.512 --> 44:01.230
Do you know why
I hate Sunday?

44:01.389 --> 44:03.938
Because it means the
starting of another week.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.063
That's true.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.024
That's when you could
play the glad game.

44:07.228 --> 44:10.232
Here it comes.
Miss Goody Two-Shoes

44:10.314 --> 44:12.191
is gonna find something
about Sunday to be glad about.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.405
Oh, lay off her, Angie.

44:13.442 --> 44:14.443
Oh, stop it!

44:14.735 --> 44:16.578
If you knew
how to play the game,

44:16.612 --> 44:18.614
then you could find something
to be glad about too.

44:18.698 --> 44:20.871
But you don't!

44:24.120 --> 44:28.500
All right, Miss Smarty-Pants.
What's so good about Sunday?

44:29.125 --> 44:30.718
Well, there's
always something.

44:30.793 --> 44:31.794
Huh.

44:33.754 --> 44:36.678
You could be glad because...

44:36.757 --> 44:39.852
Well, because what?

44:47.143 --> 44:49.191
Because it will
be six whole days

44:49.270 --> 44:51.398
before Sunday
comes around again, huh?

44:51.439 --> 44:54.067
(LAUGHING)

44:54.525 --> 44:55.902
That kid.

45:16.464 --> 45:20.139
(BELL RINGING)

45:55.795 --> 45:56.967
Hi.

45:58.422 --> 45:59.844
Why don't you come out
of the front door

45:59.924 --> 46:01.346
like normal people?

46:01.384 --> 46:02.931
They won't let us.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.851
I can come out
anytime I want with my tree.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.353
You can also fall and hurt
yourself badly.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.979
You shouldn't play in trees.

46:10.017 --> 46:13.191
That's stupid.
Don't you believe in God?

46:13.312 --> 46:15.781
Of course I do. But what's
that got to do with it?

46:15.856 --> 46:17.529
He grew it there, didn't he?

46:18.025 --> 46:20.278
So I can climb out
anytime I want.

46:20.903 --> 46:23.122
You're much too young to go
around discussing things

46:23.197 --> 46:24.744
you don't know
anything about.

46:27.702 --> 46:31.081
He did too!
Why else would it be there?

46:31.539 --> 46:33.462
Shows you're very juvenile.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.924
You aren't so much, you girl!

46:38.921 --> 46:41.800
'Sides, I'm somethin'
you can't be.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.510
I'm an orphan.

46:44.343 --> 46:46.437
Go away from me,
please, little boy.

46:47.388 --> 46:49.891
"Go away from me,
please, little boy."

46:50.391 --> 46:52.018
What is it you want?

46:52.601 --> 46:55.229
I wanna go fishin'.
You wanna come along?

46:57.732 --> 47:00.030
POLLYANNA: Aren't you
supposed to use a hook?

47:00.693 --> 47:02.491
JIMMY: I don't have a hook.

47:02.570 --> 47:03.992
Oh.

48:13.766 --> 48:15.143
Hello.

48:15.810 --> 48:17.983
Well, look who's here.
How are you?

48:18.270 --> 48:20.318
Fine, thank you.
Caught anything?

48:20.481 --> 48:21.653
Not yet.

48:35.371 --> 48:37.999
What was it you and my
Aunt Polly fought about?

48:43.045 --> 48:45.047
Now, where did you hear
about that?

48:47.091 --> 48:48.434
Oh, just around.

48:49.009 --> 48:50.852
But they won't discuss it
when I'm there.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.643
Uh, would you mind
telling me what it was?

48:54.682 --> 48:57.185
Well, Pollyanna, it's a
strange thing about arguments.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.733
At the time they seem
very important.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.105
But now...

49:02.314 --> 49:04.737
You know, I can't even
remember what it was about.

49:04.817 --> 49:06.285
(CHUCKLING)

49:09.697 --> 49:11.540
Aunt Polly's very pretty.

49:13.951 --> 49:16.170
Yes, I think she is.
Don't you?

49:17.163 --> 49:20.042
Yes. I just said so.

49:24.336 --> 49:28.182
I love her, but I don't love
the way she fixes her hair.

49:28.507 --> 49:29.884
Years ago she used to wear it

49:29.967 --> 49:32.015
long and soft
down to her shoulders.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.059
It was very soft.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.683
It must have
been beautiful.

49:39.727 --> 49:41.821
Yes, it was very beautiful.

49:48.736 --> 49:51.034
Did you used to be
in love with her?

49:52.198 --> 49:53.745
(SPLASHING)

49:53.782 --> 49:56.080
Come on, Pollyanna, let's go.

49:57.077 --> 50:00.251
Reverend Ford and his wife
are with Aunt Polly now,

50:01.081 --> 50:03.459
but they'll...
But they'll be leaving soon.

50:04.585 --> 50:07.008
I suppose Aunt Polly will
be alone by herself

50:07.087 --> 50:08.634
most of the afternoon.

50:09.715 --> 50:10.716
Well,

50:10.758 --> 50:13.102
I-I better be
going now. Good-bye.

50:19.225 --> 50:21.444
- You wanna know something?
-What?

50:21.852 --> 50:24.275
Trees are
the best things in the world.

50:24.730 --> 50:26.357
You can hide up in 'em, and

50:26.440 --> 50:28.158
people don't
even know where you are,

50:28.234 --> 50:30.487
and they're walking
right beneath you.

50:30.569 --> 50:33.573
- I never thought much about it.
-Well, they are.

50:33.614 --> 50:35.412
- You wanna see something?
-What?

50:35.783 --> 50:37.410
Come on. I'll show ya.

50:53.050 --> 50:55.018
It says, "Keep out."

50:55.094 --> 50:58.143
Shh. You've gotta keep quiet.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.160
You see that place?

51:19.368 --> 51:20.415
POLLYANNA: What about it?

51:20.494 --> 51:21.871
JIMMY: That's old man
Pendergast's place.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.669
He's the meanest man in town!

51:25.749 --> 51:27.171
Well, what are we doing here?

51:27.209 --> 51:28.836
Shh. Keep quiet.

51:37.803 --> 51:39.476
Come on, Pollyanna.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.490
This is his old
wet basement with rats in it.

51:49.565 --> 51:51.238
He hates kids.

51:51.317 --> 51:54.696
If he catches ya, he throws ya
down in his basement,

51:54.737 --> 51:56.865
and keeps ya for his slave.

51:57.364 --> 51:59.366
Then what are we doing here?

51:59.491 --> 52:01.539
Because I wanna
show ya somethin'.

52:19.178 --> 52:20.896
There it is.

52:21.764 --> 52:23.482
Up there.

52:24.725 --> 52:27.319
The best
climbin' tree in town.

52:30.064 --> 52:31.862
Isn't it a beauty?

52:32.066 --> 52:35.570
Well, of all the stupid
little juvenile tricks!

52:36.111 --> 52:38.159
Do you mean to tell me
that you brought me

52:38.238 --> 52:39.785
all the way up here

52:39.865 --> 52:43.995
just to see a crummy old...
A crummy old tree?

52:44.244 --> 52:46.087
Wait a minute, Pollyanna!

52:46.246 --> 52:48.590
- Don't ya even wanna climb it?
-No!

52:48.957 --> 52:50.880
Well, would ya
give me a boost?

52:51.418 --> 52:54.012
Aw, come on. Please.

52:55.881 --> 52:57.428
All right.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.973
All right. Up this way.

53:00.052 --> 53:01.975
More. Come on. Higher.

53:02.054 --> 53:05.058
A little bit higher.
Just a little bit more.

53:05.099 --> 53:07.943
Little bit... Higher. Right...

53:09.144 --> 53:10.612
Right there.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.444
What are you doing here?

53:12.481 --> 53:13.698
Look out!

53:13.774 --> 53:15.367
- I've gotcha!
-(SCREAMING)

53:15.442 --> 53:18.195
-(MUTTERING)
-Lemme go!

53:18.278 --> 53:19.495
I've got you,
you little vandal.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.957
Come back here, you little girl!
Come back here!

53:22.533 --> 53:25.332
You wicked little boy.
I'm gonna get the constable this time.

53:25.411 --> 53:29.006
- Lemme go! Lemme go!
-Just shut up! I'll teach you!

53:29.081 --> 53:31.584
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget! Come here.

53:31.625 --> 53:33.593
- Lemme go!
-Come on.

53:33.627 --> 53:36.130
Lemme go!

53:42.761 --> 53:44.229
MR. PENDERGAST: You pay
attention to me.

53:44.304 --> 53:45.476
I want you children to understand

53:45.514 --> 53:46.982
that I do not want
you on my property!

53:47.057 --> 53:49.025
JIMMY: Keep away from me!
Lemme go!

53:49.101 --> 53:50.148
MR. PENDERGAST: Pay
attention to me!

53:50.227 --> 53:51.479
JIMMY: You big bully!

53:51.520 --> 53:55.275
I've told you 50 times to keep
out of that tree! You hear me?

53:55.315 --> 53:58.319
JIMMY: You keep away from me.
I wasn't hurtin' anything!

53:58.402 --> 54:00.655
MR. PENDERGAST: I'm going to call
the constable this time

54:00.696 --> 54:02.164
and see that you
keep off my property!

54:02.197 --> 54:03.665
That's all there is to
it do you hear me?

54:03.741 --> 54:05.163
Stop it! Stop it!

54:05.200 --> 54:08.420
Stop it, you mean old man!
You let him go immediately!

54:08.829 --> 54:12.174
Oh. You came back,
did you? Who are you?

54:12.249 --> 54:14.172
My Aunt Polly will
send for the police,

54:14.251 --> 54:16.470
and they'll find us in
your old rat-filled basement,

54:16.503 --> 54:18.301
and you'll go to jail!

54:18.338 --> 54:20.682
Oh, they know about me,
do they?

54:21.008 --> 54:23.682
Everything. All about
the children you've kidnapped

54:23.761 --> 54:25.559
and turned into your slaves.

54:25.721 --> 54:27.598
Serves 'em right for
trespassing on my property.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.608
We weren't hurting anything.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.277
We just wanted to climb
your old tree.

54:33.562 --> 54:34.859
You fall out of that
tree and get hurt,

54:34.897 --> 54:36.194
and I get sued
by your parents.

54:36.231 --> 54:38.984
I don't got any parents.
I'm an orphan.

54:41.195 --> 54:44.369
Well, before I pitch you into
the basement with the others,

54:44.406 --> 54:47.376
-what name do you go by, boy?
-Jimmy Bean.

54:47.409 --> 54:48.956
Jimmy Bean.

54:49.119 --> 54:51.338
I like to keep a record
of your name, you see, Jimmy,

54:51.371 --> 54:52.543
so that I can tell ya
from the rats

54:52.623 --> 54:53.795
down there in the basement.

54:53.874 --> 54:55.968
- Lemme go!
-Come back here!

54:56.043 --> 54:58.717
Oh, no, you don't.
You come back here.

55:00.214 --> 55:02.137
What am I going
to do with you?

55:03.717 --> 55:04.934
I don't know, sir.

55:07.971 --> 55:09.097
Well, it was
getting too crowded

55:09.181 --> 55:10.683
with kids in
that basement, anyway.

55:11.350 --> 55:13.819
All right, I'll let
you go this time,

55:14.269 --> 55:15.691
but you've got to promise
never to come

55:15.729 --> 55:17.151
bothering me here again.

55:17.231 --> 55:18.904
- You promise?
-Yes, sir.

55:19.024 --> 55:20.651
Cross your heart
and hope to die?

55:21.902 --> 55:24.371
All right, get out. Get out!

55:27.032 --> 55:28.659
Go on.
What are you waiting for?

55:32.621 --> 55:34.419
- You know what I think?
-No.

55:34.915 --> 55:36.087
What do you think?

55:37.709 --> 55:40.588
I don't think there's any
kids in your old basement.

55:41.088 --> 55:43.432
I think you're
just a big bluff.

55:43.465 --> 55:45.138
Oh, you do, do you?

55:45.259 --> 55:47.432
Well, put that down! What are
you doing touching things?

55:47.469 --> 55:48.846
Don't touch anything.

55:48.929 --> 55:50.772
These are my things,
and I don't want them touched.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.893
Just looks like a lot
of old dusty junk to me.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.735
Well, you wouldn't know
anything about that, anyway.

55:58.981 --> 56:00.574
You're nothing but a child.

56:01.275 --> 56:04.028
Imagine criticizing a
beautiful antique of this kind.

56:04.111 --> 56:05.829
Ugh.

56:08.824 --> 56:10.417
Never heard
of such a thing.

56:10.450 --> 56:13.920
- How'd you do that?
-What are you talking about?

56:13.954 --> 56:16.798
That. How do you make it?

56:18.166 --> 56:22.467
Don't you know anything?
I didn't make it. The sun made it.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.719
That's prismatic
reflected light.

56:25.549 --> 56:26.926
Where from?

56:26.967 --> 56:28.969
Where from? Well, uh...

56:30.762 --> 56:32.685
Oh, from here.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.644
You see these
hanging crystals?

56:37.811 --> 56:38.812
Mm-hmm.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.990
The sun's rays hit it,
and it acts like a prism.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.236
You understand?

56:42.649 --> 56:45.368
- Sure, I understand.
-You do not.

56:45.444 --> 56:47.617
You don't know what
a prism is, now, admit it.

56:48.363 --> 56:50.707
It makes a rainbow
right on your wall.

56:51.742 --> 56:52.959
Isn't it beautiful?

56:52.993 --> 56:55.121
Yes, but when the sun
sets, it'll be gone.

56:55.162 --> 56:56.960
So stop carrying on so.

56:57.164 --> 57:00.043
Sure, but it'll be back
again tomorrow

57:00.125 --> 57:01.502
when the sun comes again.

57:02.169 --> 57:05.548
- You have to admit that.
-I don't have to admit anything.

57:05.631 --> 57:07.554
Hmm.

57:08.175 --> 57:10.678
Well, I better be
going back home now.

57:14.806 --> 57:16.183
Well, good-bye,
Mr. Pendergast.

57:16.266 --> 57:17.518
It was very nice meeting you.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.524
And thank you for
showing me your house.

57:19.603 --> 57:22.322
But I didn't show you my house!
You came barging in here!

57:23.732 --> 57:25.279
Good-bye.

57:29.363 --> 57:31.707
Kids. Kids today.

57:38.038 --> 57:40.712
Well, you always were
unpredictable, Edmond.

57:41.249 --> 57:42.250
Hello, Polly.

57:42.334 --> 57:44.257
Coming here like this
without even calling.

57:45.545 --> 57:47.013
Uh, won't you sit down?

57:47.547 --> 57:49.470
- Could I get you some sherry?
-Uh, no, thank you.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.640
I ran into your niece
down at Walker's Creek.

57:52.719 --> 57:53.891
We were talking about you,

57:53.929 --> 57:56.307
and I thought, why not
stop by and say hello.

57:56.556 --> 57:57.899
Why, that's very nice.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.977
I don't know why Pollyanna
would be at Walker's Creek.

58:00.060 --> 58:03.485
Oh, she was playing. She told
me you'd be alone today.

58:04.314 --> 58:05.782
There were so many people
around the other day,

58:05.857 --> 58:07.074
we hardly had
a chance to talk.

58:07.150 --> 58:08.242
Yes, well,
I'm sorry that meeting

58:08.318 --> 58:09.535
got out of hand like that.

58:10.654 --> 58:12.827
Who have you seen since
you've been back?

58:12.906 --> 58:14.078
No one.

58:14.157 --> 58:15.454
You knew that
Carleen Donnelly

58:15.534 --> 58:17.081
-got married, didn't you?
-No.

58:17.411 --> 58:19.129
You remember her brother,
Beckett Donnelly?

58:19.204 --> 58:20.626
- No.
-Of course you do.

58:20.747 --> 58:22.465
You two used to argue
all the time.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.130
Well, I'm sorry, I don't.

58:26.336 --> 58:29.089
Well, it really wasn't
that important.

58:30.090 --> 58:32.593
I know what I'll do.
I'll give you a welcoming home party.

58:32.634 --> 58:34.887
It might be nice to see
some of the old faces again.

58:34.928 --> 58:37.602
I know that Gary and Nell
would love to see you.

58:37.639 --> 58:39.562
Do you know that Nell has
eight children?

58:39.599 --> 58:41.021
It's the fifth one...

58:41.101 --> 58:42.728
- Polly?
-What?

58:46.023 --> 58:47.616
I'm not very good at parties.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.193
Please don't.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.574
Well, I just thought you
might like to

58:51.611 --> 58:53.284
see some of your friends.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.241
I came back to see you.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.787
Well, that's very flattering.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.799
A busy person like you,
remembering me.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.626
I came back to see
if you were married

59:05.667 --> 59:07.169
and what had happened to you.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.547
No, I'm just the same.

59:11.548 --> 59:12.720
Nothing has changed.

59:12.799 --> 59:14.392
- Everything is...
-We made a mistake.

59:15.719 --> 59:18.268
I came back to see
if you felt the same <i>as</i> I do.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.646
Oh, but it's been five years.

59:22.809 --> 59:25.733
- You can't just pop out of...
-They were wasted years.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.822
Tell me about
your work, Edmond.

59:31.318 --> 59:33.821
We've heard that you've
opened a clinic in Baltimore.

59:33.862 --> 59:35.660
And we're very proud of you.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.035
What was it you
mentioned yesterday

59:40.118 --> 59:41.210
about the orphanage?

59:41.286 --> 59:43.835
- I don't remember.
-Oh, yes, you do.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.382
It was something about
the dispensary.

59:47.417 --> 59:50.341
It's inadequate for that
number of children, that's all.

59:50.378 --> 59:53.006
Well, I want to modernize it.
Will you help us?

59:53.048 --> 59:55.016
Just tell us
what we need, and I'll buy it.

59:55.175 --> 59:56.848
EDMOND: It's a civic
responsibility.

59:56.885 --> 59:58.353
Why should you buy it?

59:58.386 --> 01:00:00.684
POLLY: Well, it isn't as if
I couldn't afford it.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:02.728
EDMOND: What does that have
to do with it?

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:05.857
Well, it's because
I want to. I feel I should.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.530
After all, there is
an obligation to having wealth.

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:10.774
Haven't you learned yet that

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.155
people don't
like false charity?

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:15.612
Well, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:17.618
I don't know how we
got off on the subject.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.075
EDMOND: Well, it isn't
the way I wanted it.

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:24.538
Perhaps I should
come again another time.

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:26.206
Yes, perhaps you should.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.376
And maybe you
should call first.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.424
Yes, I'll do that.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:42.731
Pollyanna, look at
your new dress. It's filthy.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:43.890
And your shoes.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:49.363
Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Polly.
I was playing, and I didn't realize.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:50.943
(DOOR CLOSING)

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:56.445
What were you
and Dr. Chilton talking about?

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.954
Oh. Nothing.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.951
We were talking
about your hair.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.376
- My hair?
-Yes.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:09.091
He said you used to wear it
very long and soft

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.338
down to your shoulders.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.545
He said it was beautiful.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:17.550
Ah, yes, well...
Clean yourself up for supper, dear.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:20.101
Yes, Aunt Polly.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.540
Here is the last
of the calf's-foot jelly.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.546
Oh, but, Aunt Polly, please...

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.047
There'll be no nonsense
about it, Pollyanna.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.049
This is a duty and a job
that must be done.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.634
And Nancy will show you

01:01:56.671 --> 01:01:58.298
where the deliveries
are supposed to be made.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.602
- What kind of deliveries?
-Charity baskets, child.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:03.979
- Oh, the suffering in this world.
-Dwell on it.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.978
Appreciate how lucky you are.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.479
POLLY: Now these
two go first, Nancy,

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.401
and handle them with care.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.775
Now, where is the one
for Mrs. Snow?

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.780
Oh, we took great pains to

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:16.487
wrap that attractively,
knowing how she is.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.115
- Yes, ma'am.
-And there'll be no dawdling.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.037
And keep your clothes
clean for a change.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:22.329
Come on, off with you.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.952
Come on, honey.
We've got three more to go.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.666
Oh, just a minute, Nancy.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.418
What's in the durn thing?

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.467
Um, I think that one's
calf's-foot jelly.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.883
Oh, you don't have to look at
it <i>as</i> though it was charity.

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:39.636
Just a gift
from one friend to another.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.847
- Friend?
-Yes, I'm your friend.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:47.014
Well, uh, I better
be going now. Good-bye.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.690
People sure hate
to get charity.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.443
-Isn't it the truth?
-And I don't blame them.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.240
Do-gooders. Hah!

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:02.696
- Good-bye, Miss Ferd.
-Good-bye.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.658
- Now, how does that go again?
-Um...

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:14.210
<i>Early one morning
just as the sun was rising</i>

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.549
<i>In the valley below</i>

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.096
One up.

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:24.722
<i>Early one morning
just as the sun was rising</i>

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.727
<i>I heard a maiden singing</i>

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:32.852
That takes care of
Mrs. Gaupherson, Miss Neely,

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:35.854
the Doppsils and the Ferds.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.740
- Who's left?
-Just this one. Mrs. Snow.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.071
And I wish this one
were over with.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:42.911
What's wrong with her?

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.614
She's just plain crabby,
that's what's wrong with her.

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:47.916
You never met anyone
so cantankerous.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.540
If it was Friday,
she'd wish it was Tuesday.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.172
What did we bring her today?

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:00.595
Uh, calf's-foot jelly.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:03.928
You wait and see. She's bound
to wish she had chicken.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.184
And if we brought her chicken,
she'd want lamb broth.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.182
She's just cantankerous!

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.275
Millie?

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.695
Nancy, come on in.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.273
- How are you?
-MILLIE: Hello there.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.279
- Hello.
-Uh, this is Pollyanna Whittier.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.619
Oh, sure. I heard you were
coming to stay with your aunt.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:25.946
And this is
Mrs. Snow's daughter

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.364
- Mildred.
-How do you do?

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:28.664
- How do you do?
-Where were you

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.787
last night? We waited
and waited.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.789
At the hayride, I know.
My mother said I could go,

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.415
and at the last minute,
she changed her mind.

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:34.454
She had come kind of,

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.880
- I don't know, an upset stomach.
-(POUNDING)

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:37.423
MRS. SNOW: Stop that
noise in there!

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.926
Haven't you any
respect for a dying woman?

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.132
Oh, honestly.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.136
She was so crotchety today.
I'm just worn to a frazzle.

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:48.806
This morning I fixed her
a cup of coffee as usual.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.637
You know, I brought it in.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.846
She didn't want coffee
this morning.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:53.807
- This morning she wanted tea.
-I don't know how you stand it.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.564
I don't know, either. Had to
make her a new cup of tea.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:57.986
Do you remember the day

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.563
-that I brought the currant jelly?
-Yes!

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:02.991
- I had currant jelly from here to there.
-She threw it at you!

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:11.496
- Hello.
-Who are you?

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.502
And what're you doing
in my bedroom?

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:19.215
- Uh, uh, I'm Pollyanna Whittier.
-Who?

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.717
- Miss Harrington's niece.
-Oh.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.004
The ladies' aid has
sent me with this.

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.840
- Yeah? What is it?
-Calf's-foot jelly.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.017
Calf's-foot jelly.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:34.474
Oh, and I had my heart set
on lamb's broth today.

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.021
You mean chicken, don't you?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.106
What's that?

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:40.732
Well, they told me you always

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:43.361
wanted chicken when
you were brought jelly.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.613
You're a Miss Impertinence,
aren't you?

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.033
Come here.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.163
Come right over here.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:57.457
You have a stubby little nose.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:58.834
What do you think about that?

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:02.877
I know it.
I wish I were pretty like you.

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.261
Oh, don't you try
to butter me up.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.888
I'm not at all pretty.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.552
Oh, but you are.
And you don't look sick at all.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:15.848
Well, that shows you what a
stupid little girl you are.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.816
Go on. Get out of my way.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.812
Why, I'm right on
death's doorstep.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.277
Just hanging on
by sheer willpower.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.452
If you had to lay here day
after day and day after day,

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:30.870
and you'd call anybody,
and your daughter...

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.372
Put that down! Stop it.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.249
And she wouldn't come.
She's gallivanting somewhere.

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:37.456
And the doctor,
all he gives you is pills.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:40.084
Just pills and bills,
that's all.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.669
- What are you staring at?
-Your prisms.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:48.255
- My what?
-Your prisms.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.257
Did you know they paint
rainbows on your wall?

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.264
Oh?

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:56.517
See? On that wall over there.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.157
How'd you do that?

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.278
I said, "I'm too old and
too smart for that old saw,

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:12.954
-"Fred Pallegrew."
-Well, I should say so.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.121
"You turn that horse around

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:16.700
"and head out from underneath
this covered bridge right now!"

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.205
I'll bet that
cooled his heels.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.753
You should've seen his face.

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.294
- More coffee?
-Oh, please.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:28.719
It's awful quiet in there.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.755
I wonder what's going on.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:35.889
MRS. SNOW: More to your left.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.890
To your left, you silly girl.
What's the matter with ya?

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:41.475
Now, there, there.

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:45.111
- That's not bad at all.
-Not bad?

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:49.157
It's gorgeous.
I think it was a fine idea.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:50.449
Don't be taking credit.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.531
I suggested
stringing them up there.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:56.699
Why, Mrs. Snow,
that's a fib!

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.492
It was my idea.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.828
It was my idea
to use the string.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:03.462
You didn't know how to do it
till I suggested the string.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.666
You're impertinent.
I don't like you at all.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.045
I'm sorry.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.848
When are you
coming back again?

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.134
Tomorrow, I guess.
I'll see you then.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.803
Well, if I'm not in my grave.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.397
<i>POLLY ANNA: Bye.</i>

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.399
Bye.

01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:25.397
All right, Nancy.

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:28.104
- Good-bye, Millie.
-Good-bye, Nancy.

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:31.988
- Good-bye, Pollyanna.
-Bye.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.201
Don't stand there.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:37.997
Go on and fix a cold pack
for my headache. Go on.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:41.205
- Go on!
-Yes, Mother.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.100
Let's get some
gumption around here.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.352
Let's start acting
like a community.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.188
Hey, Doc,

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.193
you just sit there
chewing on that straw.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.901
Put in your two bits worth.
What do you think?

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.732
I came here to fish, Charlie.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.904
I don't want to butt
in to your affairs here.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.863
Ben Tarbell!
Where are you sneaking off to?

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.872
You folks are
biting off a pretty big

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:24.161
chew with all this talk.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.086
Come on, Ben. Get it said.

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.997
A lot of us have
got vested interest

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:29.252
in the Harrington companies.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.630
Our wives belong
to her ladies' aid group.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.304
My woman would skin me alive
if I was to go opposite

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.098
to Polly Harrington,
and that's the truth!

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:40.301
- I'm sorry.
-(MURMURING)

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:43.264
Anybody else want to quit?
Do it now!

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.394
All right, then.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.229
Let's get our hands out
of our hip pockets

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.768
and find a way
to raise some money.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:52.359
- Are you with me?
-(APPLAUSE, MURMURING)

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:59.822
<i>Early one morning
just as the sun was rising</i>

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:05.035
<i>I heard a maiden singing
in the valley below</i>

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.162
What's happening?

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:08.918
That's first thing
in the morning.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.127
Charlie Gorman, that means

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:11.962
eight men assigned
to you for carpentry.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.464
Dan Seymour'll supply
the 1-by-12s. Right, Dan?

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.591
Right.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.255
Mary, you've got to get that
cooking done.

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:18.798
Of course, you've got
that other thing to run.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.883
Yes, Karl,
I'll take care of the chicken.

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:22.886
Hi, Pollyanna.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.312
Hi. I'll be back in
a minute, Nancy.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.015
- Hi, honey.
-Hi. What's going on?

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:29.021
Lady, you are looking at
the elected head

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.443
of the entertainment
committee.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.274
Old uncle George.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.029
Entertainment
committee for what?

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:35.152
Well...

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.608
KARL: If we get
the corn, you can take that

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.026
whole thing out of there.

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:41.033
You can count on me
to haul in that lumber!

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.035
Use the big truck.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:45.492
We're gonna have the best
bazaar you've ever seen.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.082
We sure are.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.458
A bazaar?

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:50.997
To raise money
for a new orphanage.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.297
It's the first time folks have

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:53.924
stood together
against Polly Harrington.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.252
Nancy, did you know

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:57.007
-there's going to be a bazaar?
-Yes!

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:58.842
With corn on the cob and ice
cream and everything!

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.674
Can kids come, George?

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:04.185
Well, of course they...
George?

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:05.470
Now, where'd you get
that name?

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:08.014
Oh, stop.
She's known it all along.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:10.392
And you didn't tell your aunt?

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:13.528
Well, what did you think
I was, a snitch-baby?

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.526
- You're a good girl.
-When's it gonna be?

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.154
Sunday night, a week.
Let me tell you about it.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.068
What a night.
An extravaganza.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:22.370
And I'm in charge of
all the entertainment.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.161
Picture it, ladies. Darkness.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.327
And out of the night,
50 bicycles appear

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.369
moving down the square.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.297
And hanging from
their handlebars,

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:39.129
two hundred... Two hundred
gorgeous Japanese lanterns.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.239
Hey, Pollyanna.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.662
Wait for me.
Where are you goin''?

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.115
There's a big bazaar,
and I'm helping.

01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:09.409
Hey, wait a minute!

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.036
What's it for?

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:15.419
It's an extravaganza.
Picture it.

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:17.421
Darkness.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.424
Fifty bicycles.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:24.258
Two hundred gorgeous
Japanese lanterns swinging.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:27.601
And I'll be on
the lead bicycle,

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.896
riding right out in front.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:32.019
Oh, boy!
Can I help?

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:33.600
All right.
Come on.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:37.020
- Where you goin' now?
-Mr. Pendergast's.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:39.026
You're goin' back?

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:40.823
You're nutty.

01:12:51.242 --> 01:12:54.166
(MUTTERING)

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:03.255
(CHUCKLING)

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:05.298
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.932
What are you doing back here?

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.180
Oh, just came to say hello.

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:13.640
Tell you something
about your prisms.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.396
Well, what about them?

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.819
Well, aren't you going
to invite me in?

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:22.695
Invite you in? No more
privacy than a goldfish.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:25.660
All right, come in.
But you can't stay long!

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.786
Can he come in too?

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.244
- Can who come in?
-Jimmy Bean.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:36.372
POLLYANNA: Come on!
Don't be a scare-baby.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.294
Oh, come on!

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:50.556
Don't touch anything.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:52.478
Well,

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.808
why didn't you just invite
the whole town

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.473
while you were at it?

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.191
Oh, I just wanted to show

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.984
Jimmy the rainbow
on your wall.

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:01.024
- Do you mind?
-Huh!

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.777
All right. Go ahead! Go ahead!

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.154
Kids. Drive ya crazy.

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:08.160
(MUTTERING)

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:11.573
It's getting so a man can't
call his home his own anymore.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:15.751
And where do you think
it comes from?

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:17.749
Through this little
piece of glass.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:19.796
Explain it to him,
Mr. Pendergast.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.215
I've got work to do.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:24.385
Don't you know anything about
refracted light there, boy?

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.588
It's the sunlight
coming through...

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:28.469
I'll do the explaining
if you don't mind,

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:30.049
little Miss Know-It-All.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.391
Now, boy,

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:33.393
you see here the...

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:35.555
Don't they ever cut your hair
in that darned orphanage?

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.561
I like it the way it is.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.017
Look at you. So much hair,

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.731
you look like you're
wearing a coonskin cap.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:43.734
- Lemme go, will ya?
-Anyway,

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.861
about the refracted light.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.400
Oh, yes.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:50.194
Now, pay attention, boy.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:54.366
You see the shape of this
crystal? That is a prism.

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:56.501
The light is tripped
by that angle.

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:58.794
That refracts the ray,
splits the colors,

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:00.746
defuses them at
an oblique angle

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.665
and bends it out into
a dispersed color band.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.546
You understand?

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.592
What he means is...

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:13.602
The sun comes through here
and paints a rainbow. You see?

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:16.054
Oh, I understand.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:18.356
Can I try it once? Please?

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:20.604
Go ahead.
But don't break anything.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.572
Do you know Mrs. Snow?

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.574
Well, I've just come
from her place,

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.452
and we strung a whole bunch
of them up across her window.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.781
You should see
what that does.

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:37.575
- Let's try it.
-All right.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.710
Oh, no! I've got work to do.

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:43.294
If we had some wire
or a piece of thread,

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.628
we could string 'em up
across the whole window.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.756
Oh, we could, could we?

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:49.511
Do you kids think
I've got nothing

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:51.635
better to do than
to play silly games?

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.520
Well, don't stand there
looking at me like that.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:05.274
There's string in that box over there.
Go and get it.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:07.814
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:18.958
<i>POLLY ANN A:
Oh, my goodness).!</i>

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.959
- Look.
-Yeah.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.961
Look. See over here?

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:27.216
- Look on that door.
-it's on the door. Can you see?

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.009
Look.

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:31.011
Oh, it's gorgeous!

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:35.516
The most beautiful room
in the entire world.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:39.346
It's not bad, is it?
It's not bad at all.

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.395
That dining room
looks awfully gloomy.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:45.522
Why don't we do
the same thing in there?

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.820
- JIMMY: Oh, boy, let's go!
-No.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:50.276
What do you mean, "No"?
I thought you enjoyed it.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:52.734
Well, it's what I came to see
you about, Mr. Pendergast.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:55.741
You see, they're having
a big bazaar in town,

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.367
and they're trying to raise

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.621
enough money to build
a new orphanage.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.745
- I like the old one.
-Be still.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:03.203
Anyway, they need help,

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:05.372
and everyone's supposed
to bring somebody else.

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:07.581
And I want to bring you.

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:09.838
What for?

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:12.378
They're having all kinds
of stands to sell things.

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:16.682
Hooked rugs, quilts
and crocheted tablecloths.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:21.596
And we could have a stand and
sell these... Rainbow makers!

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.982
I'll bet everyone
would buy one.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:26.900
I never go into town, and I

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.732
don't believe
in community projects.

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:30.692
But they need you!

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.573
They need me?
(CHUCKLING)

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.079
Of course they are
sort of attractive

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.581
little things, aren't they?

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.040
I just wonder if folks
would buy a thing like this.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.338
I wonder.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:54.216
Now, I'm not trying to sell
you the brass, but it is durable.

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:55.630
Well, the silver's pretty,

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:57.431
and I think you're
right about the brass.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.850
Oh, I don't know.
I just can't make up my mind.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:03.938
Of course the effect of silver
is always in good taste.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.230
Hello, Mrs. Snow.

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:07.392
Well, where have you been,
you naughty girl?

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:09.982
Oh, I'm sorry. I've been
helping for the bazaar.

01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:11.733
- Hello, Mr. Murg.
-How do you do?

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:12.987
What have you got there?

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:14.690
Don't bring those
dirty rags in here!

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:17.777
- Get them off my bed!
-Oh, they aren't dirty rags.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:21.455
They're patchwork squares.
Mrs. Gaupherson made them.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:24.708
I thought, perhaps, you'd like
to stitch them together

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.956
to make a patchwork quilt
for the bazaar.

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:29.088
- What an impertinent child!
-Listen!

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.714
You just take them
right out of here!

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:32.291
I'm not going to do
anything of the sort!

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.256
But everyone's
helping.

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:38.014
Mr. Neely, the Julians,
and even old Mrs. Thurm.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.888
Oh, she wants me to work
in my condition.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:44.595
Don't bother Mrs. Snow, girl.

01:18:44.929 --> 01:18:46.556
She's a very sick woman.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:50.192
I thought it might give you
something to do

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.065
instead of just lying around.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.648
I mean, the bazaar's
for an awfully good cause.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.824
Well, it's a waste of time.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.656
Nobody'll come to it.
You wait and see.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:02.162
- That's right.
-Why not?

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:05.996
Because of your aunt.
That's why not.

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:09.458
Well, I don't
understand.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:12.465
Well, we do.
Don't we, Mr. Murg?

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:14.717
- Indeed we do.
-Mm-hmm. Good. Well.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.011
Now, about this white satin.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.506
I think it's lovely.
This is my first choice.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.683
- And I think the best one.
-Yes.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.102
It'll look lovely
against the <i>brass</i> handles.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.058
Are you having a dress made?

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.860
Don't be impertinent.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:36.105
I'm picking the lining
for my coffin.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:37.815
That's right.

01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:41.031
But you're not gonna die!

01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:44.705
Does she have to be here?

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:47.700
Go on into the kitchen
and talk to Mildred.

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:53.877
Now...
Now, this satin is lovely.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.550
Well, it's all settled then.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:01.972
Thirteen yards
of the white satin...

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:05.051
At $1.20 the yard.

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:09.851
And the brass
coffin handles.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:12.562
MRS. SNOW: Well, all right.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.564
All right. Write it up.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.692
Stop frowning at me like that.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.698
What's the matter with you?

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:22.235
Well, it's just that...

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:26.072
Well, a person shouldn't
think about dying so much.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.868
- I don't want you to die.
-Oh, bless you for that.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.917
Seems everyone else
can't wait.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:35.547
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.585
I'm not supposed to talk
about my father at home,

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.595
but I guess it's
all right here.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.422
My father used to say,

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.432
"A person should
think about living."

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:49.562
Why don't you go
outside and play?

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:53.558
Hush up. I want to
hear what she has to say.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:55.852
- Yes, Miss Snow, yes.
-It just reminded me

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:57.857
about my father and the doll.

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:00.234
You see, I always
wanted a doll,

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.859
but we never had enough
money for things like that.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:04.944
My father was a minister.

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:08.448
But surely he could afford
a little thing like a doll.

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:11.742
Well, he couldn't. We had to
have the money for food.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:14.958
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
-Shh.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:18.667
So, anyway, my father wrote
to the missionary people

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:22.174
and asked them to please send
a little secondhand doll.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.137
Well, it was a funny mistake.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.842
When the missionary barrels
came, instead of a doll,

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:29.848
they sent a pair of crutches.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.139
Well, of course I was
rather disappointed,

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:35.315
so my father made up
the glad game!

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:37.147
The what game?

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.357
She's been pestering
folks all over town

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.530
with this sunshine
and happiness thing.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:45.614
Hearts and flowers.
Enough to make you sick.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:47.619
Hush up. I want to hear it.

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:49.621
Certainly.

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:53.792
Anyway, about the crutches,

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.545
my father said,
"Don't let's be gloomy.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.998
"Let's try and find something
to be glad about."

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.043
So, we made a game of it.
The glad game.

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:04.595
MR. MURG: The glad game.
MRS. SNOW: Shh!

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:09.600
So, anyway, we played
the game and after a while,

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.973
I forgot about the doll
and being gloomy.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:15.853
And you know what?
I found a reason for being glad.

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:19.025
Well, there's nothing happy
about a pair of crutches.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:22.359
Well, we were glad that
we didn't have to use them.

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:25.191
Why must you bedevil

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:27.075
this poor dying
woman with your

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:28.869
childish,
silly little stories?

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.867
I just thought
she could play the game!

01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:33.783
You could be glad you don't
need this horrid old coffin!

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.038
You could help others

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:38.291
by making the patchwork quilt
for the orphans if you wanted!

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:42.420
You ought to forget about dying,
and be glad you're living!

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.505
Oh, I don't care what you do.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.387
I'm not going to come
and see you anymore.

01:22:58.056 --> 01:23:01.686
I... I didn't mean
to hurt her feelings.

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:06.277
She's serious
about it, isn't she?

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:09.405
Oh, please, please,
Mr. Murg, leave me alone.

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:11.911
I'm sorry if I've...

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:15.825
Please.
Please, leave me alone.

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:12.301
Ben told me yesterday
they've been organizing.

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:13.883
About 50 of them.

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:16.344
And Ed Chilton's got a
finger in the pie too.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:17.811
- Edmond?
-Gave them the idea,

01:24:17.844 --> 01:24:19.687
is what he did,
and that's not all.

01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:20.980
It couldn't have been Nancy.

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:23.142
I tell you she was there.
Jesse told me.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:28.530
Well, I'd fire that girl so fast,
it would make her head swim.

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:31.776
And that child!
Your own niece!

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:33.911
- Helping them.
-(DOOR OPENING)

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.822
Pollyanna!

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.498
Just a moment.

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:42.081
Mrs. Tarbell tells me you're
involved with that bazaar.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.161
Well, I won't have it.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:46.169
But, Aunt Polly,
I'm part of the flag!

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.541
We won't discuss it.

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:49.217
I don't want you to
see those people anymore.

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:50.590
And that's an order!

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:53.506
Yes, ma'am.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:59.845
The blessings
you've heaped on that child,

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:02.390
and her working
with those people against you.

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:07.190
Get down my cake tins, Angie.
We're going to work.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:08.358
Doin' what?

01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:10.318
Thinks she's the
Queen of Sheba, does she?

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.364
Well, she can't stop us
from helping with that bazaar.

01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:17.450
We're going to bake cakes,
dozens and dozens of 'em.

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:18.997
Where you gonna get
the ingredients?

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:21.366
Where do you think?

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.370
Oh.

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.461
You're getting
paid, aren't you?

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.214
Not to be kicked!
He kicked me in the stomach.

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:32.715
Now, Jimmy, you've got to

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.421
stop kicking
Mr. Hooper and sit still!

01:25:34.504 --> 01:25:36.302
I don't wanna get
my hair cut!

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.054
Hey, Jed, get that
hammer out back,

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:39.308
and we'll nail his
shoes to the chair.

01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:40.431
(MEN LAUGHING)

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.433
- Mayor.
-Mr. Pendergast.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:45.774
You should be ashamed of
yourself, Ben Tarbell!

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:48.352
I paid for the tickets.
Will you let it go at that, Karl?

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:49.895
I just can't show up
at your affair.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.355
You ain't the only one, Ben.

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:54.024
- What do you mean by that?
-(DOOR OPENING)

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:56.694
Claire, I just came from
your newspaper office.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.237
What's the matter
with those fellas?

01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.747
They said they couldn't
handle this ad for our bazaar.

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.244
Will you go over
and straighten them out?

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:03.667
Now, take it easy, Doc.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.961
Our space is all sold,
and I can't go around...

01:26:06.036 --> 01:26:09.381
Tell him the truth.
Why lie to the man? You're a coward.

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:12.759
It isn't Baltimore up here, Doc.
This is a small town.

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:14.131
You know as well as everybody

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:16.088
our newspaper is owned by
the Harrington family.

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:18.427
Liver-bellied bunch
of miserable sheep!

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:21.602
Now, take it easy, Pendergast.
It's the way things are.

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.224
I say that you're
all chicken-livered,

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:24.558
and I'm sick and tired...

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:27.315
Just a minute,
just a minute! The thing is this.

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:29.018
Most folks here make a living

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.944
out of Polly Harrington
some way or another.

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:32.479
We can't afford
to antagonize her.

01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:34.610
Can't afford
to antagonize her?

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.283
Just don't be
surprised if come

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.281
Sunday night nobody
shows up at your bazaar.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.782
I don't believe that.

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.707
Well, you're coming,
aren't you?

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:46.456
Claire? Charlie?

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.215
People are just
plain scared to, Karl.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:52.799
They're afraid
of Polly Harrington

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.171
paying 'em back later.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:57.546
- She'll do it too. You know her.
-EDMOND: Now, look.

01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:00.056
We've all taken
a cut or two at the Harringtons,

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.850
but she wouldn't
do a thing like that.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:07.890
If you think
I'm intimidating a whole town...

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:09.600
Oh, Polly, you know
what I mean.

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:11.310
No one will make
a move in this town

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:12.944
without the Harrington
stamp of approval.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.275
Oh!

01:27:17.315 --> 01:27:18.942
Karl Warren sent you,
didn't he?

01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:21.203
He knew no one would
cooperate without me.

01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:23.622
Nobody sent me. I just wanted

01:27:23.655 --> 01:27:25.202
it made clear you don't mind
if the others cooperate...

01:27:25.282 --> 01:27:27.000
You needed my help.
Why don't you admit it?

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.628
Won't let your guard down
for a minute, will you?

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:34.132
Still suspicious.
Still don't trust anyone.

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:36.926
Nothing's changed,
has it, Polly?

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.339
You're still
as opinionated as ever.

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.007
If that's what you mean.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.011
Oh, Angelica.

01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:48.434
Dr. Chilton is leaving.

01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:53.860
Keep busy, Polly.

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:56.188
Lots of meetings and civic
duties and obligations.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:59.612
It's a poor substitute for
what's really wrong with you.

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:01.944
I knew I could count on you

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:03.995
for some lofty
clinical observations.

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:07.074
Would you like
to be paid for your diagnosis?

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.418
This one's on the house.

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:12.875
There's no
medical term for it.

01:28:13.872 --> 01:28:15.340
You can give everything
but love.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:17.584
It's <i>as</i> simple as that.

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.688
- Angelica.
-Mum?

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:32.190
See that the flowers
in the conservatory

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:33.271
get fresh water.

01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:35.273
I found them dry again today.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:36.774
Yes, mum.

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:48.790
Did you hear how
he told her off?

01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:51.368
Like water off
a duck's back to her.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:54.500
That woman's got no
feelings at all.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.459
MAN: How'd it go, Ed?

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:34.619
Stubborn, mule-headed woman.

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:36.755
Just like her father.
I should've known better.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:38.586
- What did she say?
-A lot of foolish nonsense.

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:41.793
What she really wants
is for us to go begging to her.

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:43.178
Get her sanction, permission

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:45.798
from the queen
to gather in the streets.

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:47.386
- Hi, Nancy.
-Hi, dear.

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:48.762
- What's the matter?
-Oh, nothing.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.269
It's a doggone shame after all
the work folks put into it.

01:29:51.678 --> 01:29:54.306
- Is the bazaar off?
-It looks that way.

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:56.770
- Why?
-You wouldn't understand.

01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:59.603
- Is it because of Aunt Polly?
-Yes.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.271
It takes a word from someone,

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:04.112
-someone who isn't under her thumb.
-Fat chance you got, Ed.

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:05.651
She's got her finger
in nearly everything.

01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:07.990
The bank, the mills,
the paper, real estate.

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:11.323
Harrington Town, a fine thing.
One woman owning a town.

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:13.537
Well, like it or not,
that's what she does.

01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:14.869
- Nancy.
-Yes?

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:17.454
- She doesn't own the church.
-That's right.

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:20.711
What did you say?

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:27.718
Um, I just said that
nobody could own a church.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.932
Our social structure
in this small town

01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:34.638
seems to teeter
on a delicate balance,

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:38.525
one which I certainly cannot
in any way attempt to influence.

01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:41.402
A man of God cannot
be taking sides in these feuds.

01:30:41.478 --> 01:30:42.525
But all we want is a word

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:43.605
-from you, Reverend.
-No.

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:44.940
If just let the people know tomorrow

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:46.696
-you're in favor of us.
-No, no, no.

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:48.827
I won't use that pulpit
for public announcements.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:51.204
Then you're siding with her
by not mentioning it!

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.783
I am not. I'm staying
completely out of it,

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:55.867
and that's all there is to it.

01:30:55.909 --> 01:30:58.378
Reverend Ford, if you'll just
let us say that you're in favor.

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:01.335
There's nothing more
to discuss.

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:05.385
- This is all just impossible.
-I'm afraid you're right.

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:14.094
Thank you, Reverend Ford.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:24.730
You see, I... Of course
you understand that...

01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:27.487
Personally,
I think it's a good cause

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:29.743
and all that,
and I wish you luck with it.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:34.035
Thanks a lot.
I guess Pollyanna was wrong.

01:31:34.698 --> 01:31:37.622
Now, what has she got
to do with this?

01:31:38.368 --> 01:31:40.962
She said nobody
could own a church.

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:56.470
- Hello, Mrs. Ford.
-Hello, dear.

01:31:56.553 --> 01:31:59.102
- What are you doing here?
-Aunt Polly sent me.

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:00.937
Uh, something
for Reverend Ford.

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.692
Oh, he's just back up there.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:04.440
Oh, yes, I saw him. Thank you.

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:07.443
- It's a lovely day, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:17.078
REVEREND FORD: And he
sayeth unto them,

01:32:17.949 --> 01:32:20.418
the wicked shall be punished!

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:25.666
The wicked shall be punished.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:31.638
Their poison is like
the poison of serpents.

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:35.851
But they shall feel
the gall of asps within them!

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:37.886
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:44.480
How many times have I
stood on this pulpit...

01:32:45.351 --> 01:32:48.696
And warned you,
cautioned you again and again?

01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:53.486
A house divided
against itself cannot stand.

01:32:53.777 --> 01:32:57.623
A kingdom divided against
itself can be brought to desolation.

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.835
If you are an enemy
to one another,

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:05.213
then you are an enemy to God!

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:10.343
Am I reaching out to you?
Do you understand my words?

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:14.347
Well,

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:18.806
week after week, I stand here

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:22.852
reaching out to you,
begging you to understand.

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:27.478
Yet week after week,
the same wickedness persists!

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:29.946
The same dissension,

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:33.525
the same belligerence,
the same feuding,

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.119
until you are 10,000 times

01:33:36.236 --> 01:33:39.331
more abominable in
the eyes of God

01:33:39.697 --> 01:33:42.371
than the most hateful,
venomous, violent,

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:44.836
vicious...

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.503
You.

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:52.464
What are you doing here?

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:57.095
Oh, nothing. Um, I mean,
I was looking for you.

01:33:57.423 --> 01:33:59.596
Uh, Aunt Polly sent you this.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.267
- Now, what is it?
-Uh, I don't know.

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:07.063
I'm sorry I disturbed
your practice.

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:17.736
Would you like someone
to practice your sermon on?

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:19.196
No, thank you, child.

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:25.581
Uh, mother and I used to be an
audience to my father,

01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:28.087
when he was practicing
his sermons.

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:32.918
H-he was a minister, too,
you know.

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:34.632
Yes, yes, so he was.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:39.633
Uh, do you like
being a minister?

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.764
Do I like being a...

01:34:49.225 --> 01:34:51.899
Now, why would you ask
a thing like that?

01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:56.942
Oh, the way you looked just
then reminded me of my father.

01:34:58.234 --> 01:35:01.864
Once I saw him sorta sad
like that and I asked him.

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:08.749
And what did he say?

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.169
Oh, well,
he said he was glad he was,

01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:15.635
but it made him
sad sometimes,

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:17.712
when he just couldn't seem
to get through

01:35:17.795 --> 01:35:19.547
to his congregation.

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:21.804
Sounds familiar.

01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:25.642
I suppose every minister of
God faces the same problem.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.267
Mmm, I suppose.

01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:32.561
Tell me, did your father
ever solve the problem?

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:37.319
Well, he read something one
day that he said helped him.

01:35:38.274 --> 01:35:39.742
In the Bible?

01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:43.155
No. Just something
he read someplace.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.828
He had it put on this chain.

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:48.835
He wore it always.
It's all I have of his.

01:35:51.287 --> 01:35:54.712
"When you look for the bad..."

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:57.794
Ooh!
It always makes me cross-eyed.

01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:00.638
- May I?
-Mmm.

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:10.979
"When you look for the bad
in mankind expecting to find it,

01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:13.984
"you surely will.

01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:16.445
"Abraham Lincoln."

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:19.028
He was the President.

01:36:19.857 --> 01:36:21.859
Yes, yes, I know.

01:36:25.863 --> 01:36:28.116
But I never heard that before.

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.577
Neither had my father.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.834
Anyway, he said
it started him thinking.

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:37.842
And from then on, he was going
to look for the good in people.

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:40.048
That's when we both started

01:36:40.086 --> 01:36:41.554
searching through the Bible
for the texts.

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:43.756
The texts?

01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:46.551
Yes, you know.

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:50.013
My father called them
the glad passages.

01:36:50.888 --> 01:36:52.890
You know, the happy ones,

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:55.727
like, um, uh...

01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:57.896
"Shout for joy," or...

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:01.570
"Be glad in the Lord."
You know, like that.

01:37:02.108 --> 01:37:05.078
There are 800 happy texts.
Did you know that?

01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:06.988
No, I didn't know that.

01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:08.539
Yes, well, there are.

01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:10.541
And, you know, my father said,

01:37:10.575 --> 01:37:13.328
"if God took the trouble
to tell us 800 times

01:37:13.411 --> 01:37:14.833
"to be glad and rejoice,

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:17.757
"he must have wanted us
to do it."

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.756
Oh, I better be going now.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:22.929
I'm sorry
I disturbed your practicing.

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:24.214
I'll see you later.

01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:26.223
Uh, good-bye.

01:37:38.436 --> 01:37:40.404
Good-bye, Reverend Ford!

01:37:57.288 --> 01:37:59.666
"Dear Reverend,

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:03.212
"I've taken the liberty of
jotting down a few thoughts

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:05.513
"and some text from Matthew

01:38:07.131 --> 01:38:08.633

you might want to use

01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:30.989
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

01:38:32.115 --> 01:38:33.958
What have I done?

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.181
Dear, are you all right?

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:08.943
Nobody owns a church.

01:39:09.902 --> 01:39:11.324
No one.

Paragraph 22.

01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:10.756
"Gladness of the heart
is the life of man."

01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:16.469
Now, this is one
of the rejoicing,

01:40:16.552 --> 01:40:18.600
or happy texts.

01:40:19.972 --> 01:40:21.940
A young member of our parish
pointed out to me

01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:25.478
that there are 800
such happy texts in our Bible.

01:40:27.104 --> 01:40:28.947
Well, she was wrong.

01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:32.948
There are, to be exact,

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:36.368
826.

01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:38.742
I know because I stayed up

01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:41.161
most of last night
counting them.

01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:48.001
I intend to read
one of them every week.

01:40:48.626 --> 01:40:50.799
And that should take us,
according to my calculations,

01:40:50.836 --> 01:40:52.509
through 16 years,

01:40:54.048 --> 01:40:56.176
if I'm around here that long.

01:40:59.595 --> 01:41:02.849
Well, I can promise you this...
If I am here,

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:07.812
our visits with God on Sunday
are going to be happier,

01:41:08.271 --> 01:41:10.365
and more rejoicing too.

01:41:12.483 --> 01:41:13.575
Uh...

01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:23.669
Now, what I have to say now

01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:26.376
is very difficult for me,

01:41:28.291 --> 01:41:30.089
but it must be said.

01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:34.055
I look out to you now,

01:41:35.756 --> 01:41:37.349
and realize,

01:41:38.342 --> 01:41:41.141
after four years
in this congregation,

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.181
I don't even know you.

01:41:45.141 --> 01:41:47.985
I look out to you now
not <i>as</i> my congregation,

01:41:48.352 --> 01:41:52.198
but as people,
and I say to myself,

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:54.654
how sad it is to have missed
those four years.

01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:57.571
Four years when
we could have been friends.

01:41:58.362 --> 01:42:01.457
I should have been looking
for the good in you,

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:06.204
and I... I failed you.

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:11.672
And I apologize for this.

01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:16.380
God is forgiving,

01:42:16.422 --> 01:42:20.143
but it's not God's forgiveness
I beg, it is yours.

01:42:24.055 --> 01:42:26.023
I'm not going to speak
about this anymore now.

01:42:26.057 --> 01:42:28.105
It's a lovely day outside,

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:32.279
so let's go outside and enjoy
this Sunday for a change.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.232
And while you're out
appreciating the sunlight,

01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:38.536

who's sending it down to you.

It's a larger room,
and it has a much nicer view.

02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:25.385

she's going to have

02:00:25.468 --> 02:00:27.971

Stop that. Now, you go away from here.

But I want to play
with Pollyanna.

-No, no. Nobody's blaming you.

But it's true, isn't it?

02:02:33.763 --> 02:02:36.767
I could have been
the least bit understanding.

02:02:41.938 --> 02:02:44.942
Polly, the mercy of God
is forgiving...

02:02:44.983 --> 02:02:47.361
Oh, what kind of a merciful
God could allow a thing like this

02:02:47.443 --> 02:02:49.195
to happen to a child?

02:02:49.571 --> 02:02:50.618
And if he were merciful,

02:02:50.655 --> 02:02:53.158
why did he let her
come to our town?

It's very contagious.

02:03:10.091 --> 02:03:14.267
Just think, Polly. If she had
never come to this town...

02:03:19.559 --> 02:03:20.902
We ought to get down
on our knees

02:03:20.977 --> 02:03:23.196

for sending her to us.

don't you, dear?

02:03:49.839 --> 02:03:51.512
And there's nothing
to be afraid of.

02:03:51.549 --> 02:03:53.051
What is it, Edmond?

02:03:53.134 --> 02:03:54.807
I told Pollyanna
about her injury.

02:03:54.844 --> 02:03:57.188
She understands.
Don't you, dear?

02:03:58.222 --> 02:04:00.065
We're gonna take you
to Baltimore for an operation

02:04:00.141 --> 02:04:01.688
so you can walk again.

02:04:02.018 --> 02:04:03.361
You hear that, honey?

02:04:11.235 --> 02:04:13.033
Now,
why don't we all cheer up.

02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:17.992
Let's see
if we can't find something

02:04:18.076 --> 02:04:20.545
to be glad about
your staying in bed.

02:04:21.412 --> 02:04:23.790

Did you know that your aunt
ordered it for you?

02:04:31.047 --> 02:04:33.220
Now you find something
to be glad about.

02:04:33.257 --> 02:04:34.383
We'll play the game.

02:04:36.886 --> 02:04:38.479
Well...

02:04:42.934 --> 02:04:45.403
I suppose I could
be glad because...

02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:48.277
Yes, go ahead, darling.

02:04:51.234 --> 02:04:54.784
No. It was a silly game.

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:57.202
I hate it.

02:04:58.741 --> 02:05:01.164
I'll never want
to play it again.

02:05:02.578 --> 02:05:04.080
Leave me alone.

02:05:12.588 --> 02:05:15.091
Please try to understand,
Pollyanna.

of our lives now.

Nancy and Angelica,
Mrs. Lagerlof.

02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:29.110

you were my own little girl.

Won't you give me that chance?

02:05:32.608 --> 02:05:33.951
Please?

02:05:53.504 --> 02:05:56.053
- Put these in too, Mr. Thomas.
-All right.

02:05:56.132 --> 02:05:57.975

that the car's all ready.

02:05:58.051 --> 02:05:59.052
Yes.

02:06:00.261 --> 02:06:03.481
Yes, we're leaving
immediately on the 11:30 train.

02:06:04.057 --> 02:06:06.480
Well,
check the arrival schedule.

02:06:06.976 --> 02:06:08.694
Make sure we're met
with an ambulance.

02:06:08.770 --> 02:06:10.989
I want complete x-rays
the minute we arrive.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.693
Yes. Thank you.

02:06:21.157 --> 02:06:23.251
Is the operation dangerous?

02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:25.127
Yes, it's very delicate.

02:06:25.161 --> 02:06:26.663
You're coming, aren't you?

02:06:26.704 --> 02:06:28.798
I need
your permission to operate.

02:06:34.378 --> 02:06:35.971
Edmond.

There's something
worrying you,

02:06:38.382 --> 02:06:40.635
and I want to know what it is.

02:06:41.094 --> 02:06:43.096
We can only do so much
with surgery.

02:06:43.179 --> 02:06:45.307
A great deal depends on her.

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:47.859
This depression
she's got herself into,

02:06:47.934 --> 02:06:49.936
that's what's worrying me.

02:06:51.312 --> 02:06:52.689
Edmond.

02:06:53.564 --> 02:06:56.283
She's had a shock. She's just
learned about her legs.

02:06:56.359 --> 02:06:58.987
I can't have her despondent
like this for the operation.

02:06:59.028 --> 02:07:00.200
Well,
you have to give her time.

02:07:00.238 --> 02:07:01.785
Time? There is no time.

02:07:01.864 --> 02:07:05.289
I have to move her, get her into
the hospital, and I don't like it.

02:07:05.368 --> 02:07:08.872
What that child needs is a
good shot in the arm of hope.

02:07:10.039 --> 02:07:13.885
Hope'? What she really needed
was love.

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:16.554
And that's something
I never gave her.

02:07:21.717 --> 02:07:24.140

give her that love.

I've gotta stop 'em.

I've got to get 'em
out of there!

to tell you.

go around the other way.

We don't want anything.

"How'd ya do?" to the child

02:08:53.392 --> 02:08:56.020

into her life.

you tell her yourself?

02:09:37.895 --> 02:09:39.021
What?

02:09:39.105 --> 02:09:41.199
Are you going to greet them
with that mopey old face of yours?

02:09:42.316 --> 02:09:44.364
I don't wanna see anyone.

02:09:44.694 --> 02:09:46.662
Well, Pollyanna, you're not
gonna have much choice

02:09:46.696 --> 02:09:48.698
in the matter this time.

02:09:52.368 --> 02:09:54.291
Oh, no, please, I don't want
to see anyone.

02:09:54.370 --> 02:09:55.713
Just easy.

02:10:02.795 --> 02:10:05.799
(CHATTERING QUIETS)

02:10:26.110 --> 02:10:28.533
You'll be all right, dear.
I know.

02:10:28.904 --> 02:10:30.451
You get well now, you hear?

02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:34.627
It's not charity, just a gift
from one friend to another.

02:10:34.702 --> 02:10:36.579
Oh, thank you, Mr. Neely.

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.544
Hi, honey. You're going
to be fine. Don't you worry.

02:10:40.041 --> 02:10:43.261
Good-bye, darling. We're going
to visit you in the hospital.

02:10:43.627 --> 02:10:46.551
Hey, snookie.
Take a look at this, will ya?

02:10:47.214 --> 02:10:51.139
Really?
You mean, really? You did it!

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.480
(GASPS) Oh, Nancy!

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:57.775
-It's gorgeous.
-isn't it?

02:10:58.017 --> 02:10:59.894
And we're going
to wait for you.

02:10:59.935 --> 02:11:02.154
You're going to be
my flower girl.

02:11:06.442 --> 02:11:09.070
I'm glad you'll be
comin' back to us, darlin',

02:11:09.111 --> 02:11:11.284
and that's the truth of it.

02:11:13.032 --> 02:11:15.501
The house'll be miserable
without you.

02:11:15.576 --> 02:11:19.456
Miserable.
You hurry back to us.

02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:24.844
WOMAN: Best wishes, Pollyanna.

02:11:30.674 --> 02:11:31.721
Good-bye.

02:11:34.637 --> 02:11:35.980
Good-bye, Angelica.

02:11:43.479 --> 02:11:45.152
Hurry home to us.

02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:49.952
What is everybody
sniffing about?

02:11:49.985 --> 02:11:52.659
My goodness.
A bunch of ninnies.

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:54.661
Think a person
couldn't get well.

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.914
- Hi, Mrs. Snow.
-Oh, bless you.

02:11:58.285 --> 02:12:00.959
Bless you, darling.
I'll see you soon.

02:12:00.996 --> 02:12:03.624
- Thank you for coming.
-it's all right.

02:12:03.666 --> 02:12:05.668
- Bye.
-Good-bye.

02:12:11.298 --> 02:12:12.390
- Hello, Pollyanna.
-Hello, dear.

02:12:12.466 --> 02:12:14.013
We have a surprise for you.

02:12:14.051 --> 02:12:16.179
Shall we tell her now, Jimmy?

02:12:16.262 --> 02:12:17.514
I've been adopted.

02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:20.440
Adopted? Who?

02:12:20.516 --> 02:12:22.393
Who? Well, who do you think?

02:12:22.476 --> 02:12:26.071
We're gonna spend the rest of
our lives just hangin' prisms.

02:12:26.147 --> 02:12:27.694
You hurry home and help.

02:12:32.111 --> 02:12:33.704
Hello, Mrs. Ford.

02:12:34.196 --> 02:12:36.039
Hello, Reverend Ford.

02:12:37.283 --> 02:12:39.001
We looked
for the good in them,

02:12:39.034 --> 02:12:40.661
and we found it, didn't we?

02:12:48.586 --> 02:12:50.304
Aunt Polly?

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:21.160
- Bye, Pollyanna.
-Bye-bye.

02:13:21.243 --> 02:13:23.587
- Bye-bye.
-Bye.
