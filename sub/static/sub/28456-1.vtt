'For the first time in huge numbers,
the ordinary men and women of Beijing

00:07.947 --> 00:09.919
adjoin the student protest,

00:09.960 --> 00:13.040
lending their support to what has
now taken on all the appearances

00:13.080 --> 00:17.760
of a peaceful popular uprising against

00:48.600 --> 00:50.840
Er... thanks.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.720
Demonstrators
in the Chinese capital Beijing

01:21.760 --> 01:24.200
say they face a military attack
in five hours' time

01:24.240 --> 01:26.240
if they don't leave
Tiananmen Square.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.120
'Since the government's decision
to send in the army,

01:29.160 --> 01:33.040
the determination of the protestors
has only increased.'

01:40.140 --> 01:44.660
She wants to know what happens after
you get the dream of democracy.

01:44.700 --> 01:48.780
She says, "I know what China is dreaming of.
What is America dreaming of?"

01:50.140 --> 01:51.820
Erm...

02:24.180 --> 02:27.460
- "Why are you involved in politics at all?"
- "I enjoy it. I enjoy the system."

02:27.500 --> 02:30.700
"I doubt I'll ever be involved
in politics beyond what I do now,

02:30.740 --> 02:33.740
- but I do enjoy the system."
- Frank Sams speaking.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.100
Hi, Mr Sams.
My name is Lee Berger.

02:36.101 --> 02:38.436
I'm a photographer. I did an
internship with you last summer.

02:38.460 --> 02:42.660
Lee, it's late. You want
a reference, call back tomorrow.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.660
- I know, but I'm in Beijing.
- What?

02:45.700 --> 02:48.540
Yeah. I saw what was going on out
here with the protest and everything

02:48.580 --> 02:52.100
and I had a little money saved so I...
I've been here for, like, ten days.

02:52.140 --> 02:54.900
- In Tiananmen Square?
- Yeah. It's incredible.

02:54.940 --> 02:59.180
Yesterday with, like, the army...
Do you know what's going on out here?

02:59.220 --> 03:02.220
You mean 300 Chinese protesters being
gunned down by their own government?

03:02.221 --> 03:04.100
No, no, it's more that that.
It's like...

03:04.780 --> 03:06.720
300? Is that what they're saying?

03:07.721 --> 03:08.660
Where are you now? Are you safe?

03:08.700 --> 03:11.500
Yeah, but I have a few photos and I
thought you might be interested.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.220
- How soon can you get it back here?
- I don't know.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.220
There are soldiers outside the hotel.
I can't make it to the airport.

03:19.220 --> 03:22.900
- Son, are you OK? - They just
opened fire on their own people.

03:22.940 --> 03:26.500
- I had no idea it was gonna be
like that. - No-one did.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.620
Just sit tight.

03:28.660 --> 03:31.820
Let me see
if I can call in a favour.

03:31.860 --> 03:34.060
"BBC might have a spot
on their charter."

03:37.300 --> 03:40.540
Oh, fuck. "Lee..."

03:40.580 --> 03:42.180
"Lee?"

07:28.420 --> 07:30.940
I know, I know.
Give me 30 seconds, it's coming.

07:32.180 --> 07:34.380
Come on, mother...

07:42.500 --> 07:46.460
A lot of times when you're shooting in
those kind of places, there's a lot of dust,

07:46.500 --> 07:51.700
so I like to have a zoom lens.
That's an EF24-70mm USM.

07:51.740 --> 07:55.660
It's pretty standard,
but... I like it.

07:55.700 --> 08:01.540
OK, we're almost out of time. Does
anyone have any questions for Lee?

08:04.860 --> 08:07.580
- Yeah?
- Do you know what happened to him?

08:10.380 --> 08:14.660
No, I wish. I went back to Beijing
in 1990 to try and identify him,

08:14.700 --> 08:18.100
but if anybody knew anything, they wouldn't say.
It's too dangerous, I guess.

08:18.140 --> 08:21.140
He's probably dead by now, anyway,
but...

08:21.150 --> 08:23.850
My uncle told me it was
a guy called Wang Guanyu.

08:23.860 --> 08:26.500
He was, like, a medical
student or something.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.540
I never heard that one.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.140
Erm, can you sign this for me,
please?

08:47.180 --> 08:49.020
Sure.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.460
Actually, that's not mine.
But you took the Tank Man photo.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.580
I know, but there were, like,
six other guys who took a really similar shot.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.660
This one's Jeff Widener's, I think.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.980
Yeah, that's Jeff's.
Sorry, I can't sign that.

09:04.060 --> 09:07.540
Hey, listen, good luck. All right?

09:07.580 --> 09:10.420
Laura's got my e-mail
if you have any other questions.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.420
- OK. Thanks.
- All right, take care.

09:18.780 --> 09:22.180
I cannot wait to watch Hilary
make him eat that fucking toupee.

09:49.980 --> 09:54.060
"Hey, Mr Berger, my name's Alex
Sguerra, I'm a photojournalist.

09:54.100 --> 09:57.300
I wanted to ask a couple of things
about your Syria front page.

09:57.340 --> 10:00.020
I'd be super grateful
if you could call me back."

10:15.460 --> 10:17.260
Man, that was so depressing.

10:18.940 --> 10:22.460
- You ready to go get booed
in Pennsylvania? - Let's do it!

10:22.500 --> 10:26.060
- "The state of Pennsylvania backs the
vote for Donald Trump!" - Thank you.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.020
So Frank says you're gonna win
a Pulitzer.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.180
For what, my poetry?

10:32.220 --> 10:34.980
For your Syria front page,
your douche noggin.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.140
I don't know about that.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.820
You wanna get a beer after this?

10:43.220 --> 10:45.260
No. Erm...

10:46.260 --> 10:48.340
I just...

10:50.380 --> 10:54.260
Actually, I just went into AA, so...

10:54.300 --> 10:57.060
I was gonna tell you,
just it was while you were away,

10:57.100 --> 10:59.580
and I didn't wanna write
some cliched e-mail.

11:01.340 --> 11:04.580
- You don't have authorisation.
- Oh, that's impossible.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.180
Mel Kincaid, The New York Courier.
This is Lee Berger.

11:07.181 --> 11:08.740
Sorry, ma'am, you're not allowed in.

11:09.340 --> 11:12.980
- Do you believe that? - It's not just
you, it's your whole organisation.

11:13.020 --> 11:16.100
- Oh, is it, now? - Yes, ma'am.
- Well, thank you for that information.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.260
Thank you. Have a nice day.
Next, please.

11:18.300 --> 11:22.100
We're blacklisted. The whole
newspaper! This is so fucked up!

11:22.140 --> 11:25.220
"...join me in welcoming
the next president

11:25.260 --> 11:27.860
of the United States of America,

11:27.900 --> 11:30.020
Donald J Trump!"

11:30.060 --> 11:33.500
Fuck him! He's a joke.
Who wants to go to China?

11:33.540 --> 11:35.980
Yeah, I thought you'd like that.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.260
Trump says he's standing up to
China, but they're hand in glove,

11:39.300 --> 11:41.820
he takes loans from Chinese banks.

11:41.860 --> 11:46.020
Now, the Beijing business fair
runs this week. I want footage.

11:46.060 --> 11:49.700
I want America to hear "Vote Trump"
from the enemy's mouth.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.040
- You want video?
- Yeah.

11:52.041 --> 11:55.040
New editor's got the bit between
her teeth about online content.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.740
- You met Lou yet?
- Uh-uh. - No?

11:57.780 --> 12:02.620
Well, when you do, look busy.
She's looking to take 10% off every department.

12:02.660 --> 12:05.740
Plus, she made me join Twitter.

12:05.780 --> 12:09.540
Well, it is the internet, Frank.
It's not going anywhere.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.700
Yeah, well,
I'm still hoping it's a fad.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.260
"Lee, this is Alex Sguerra again.

12:19.300 --> 12:23.340
It's about your Syria picture.
I have some questions you need to answer.

12:23.380 --> 12:25.700
I think you know
what I'm talking about."

12:29.400 --> 12:31.440
Hey, Zhang Lin, it's Lee.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.880
I think it's, like, 4am for you, but guess what.
I'm on a plane to Beijing.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.160
I really hope I get to see you.
I miss you, man.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.360
Alright, call me back.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.800
You know that's her third
since we sat down?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.880
So?

12:53.920 --> 12:58.120
15 hours next to Zelda Fitzgerald
could be a bumpy ride.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.720
A pansy with hair on his chest.
Excuse me?

13:01.760 --> 13:04.760
That's what Zelda Fitzgerald
called Ernest Hemingway.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.760
Switch seats with me. No.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.920
- So, is this your first trip to Beijing?
- Hey, I got a tip for you.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.520
Don't eat the chicken. The average
piece of Chinese chicken,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.720
if you were an athlete
and you ate this chicken,

13:23.760 --> 13:27.360
the steroids that they pump into that
shit, you would fail a doping test.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.240
It is the Lance Armstrong
of the poultry world.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.520
OK, it's not my first time.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.280
Oh.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.880
You OK?

13:45.920 --> 13:49.320
Take-off is the worst part. Once
we're in the air, you'll be fine.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.520
You know why they tell you
to adopt the brace position?

13:53.560 --> 13:57.200
So your teeth don't smash and they can
identify your body by your dental records.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.400
Don't be mean. She's scared.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.520
- I'm Lee.
- I'm sorry.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.640
You're gonna be fine.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.800
So what are you doing out there?

14:23.810 --> 14:26.990
I'm consulting for an
American credit card company.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.200
They are taking a crack
at the Chinesemarket.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.040
I'm adapting their profiling system.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.160
- I know, it's very sexy.
- Profiling.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.640
I mean, no offence, but you're going
to a country of one billion people

14:39.680 --> 14:44.200
to make some boxes to put them in?
I mean, come on!

14:44.240 --> 14:47.200
OK, erm, I've had, like, four wines,

14:47.240 --> 14:53.040
but I would say that you are
group O, group B characteristics.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.480
Within that, I would place you
as an anti-materialist,

14:55.520 --> 14:59.120
maybe a bit of a bright young thing once,
but I think that ship has sailed, don't you?

14:59.160 --> 15:01.640
You see your work as a career,
not a job.

15:01.680 --> 15:05.560
You identify yourself as international, not national.
You have no brand loyalty.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.280
You think cannabis should be legalised,
sanitary towels should be subsidised,

15:09.320 --> 15:12.960
Donald Trump is a demagogue,
veganism is a good but unattainable goal

15:13.000 --> 15:15.080
and real men do cry.

15:15.120 --> 15:19.400
You know, it's fine to say,
"I don't wanna talk."

15:19.440 --> 15:22.000
- You know, you can just say that.
- OK.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.480
Shut up! The Tank Man?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.600
That is mental!

15:44.640 --> 15:47.160
I used to wonder
what was in his shopping bags.

15:47.200 --> 15:51.480
Yeah, well, there are kids with iPhones
who can do my job better than me now.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.720
But I don't know how to do
anything else. Kodak ergo sum.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.560
Ooh!

15:57.600 --> 16:00.400
I read that some place.
I didn't come up with it. Thought so.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.160
What?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.880
I'm so pissed.

16:31.220 --> 16:34.700
Helen, baby,
I just got off a 15-hour flight.

16:34.740 --> 16:37.180
Please do not put words in my mouth.

16:37.220 --> 16:39.980
Say hi from me. Lee says hi.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.540
Yeah, he's fine.

16:43.580 --> 16:46.420
He fucked Margaret Thatcher
on the plane.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.660
I know. It's disgusting.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.860
Hey, put Nathan on the line.

17:18.339 --> 17:22.060
- Trump. Yeah, I know him.
- I like him very much.

17:22.099 --> 17:25.740
His hair is... defying gravity.

17:25.780 --> 17:29.540
Is China scared of him?

17:29.580 --> 17:31.500
He will destroy America.

17:31.540 --> 17:34.780
Of the two candidates, who do you
think would be best for China?

17:34.820 --> 17:37.220
- Hilary is crooked.
- Vote Trump.

17:37.260 --> 17:39.020
- Vote Trump!
- Vote Trump!

17:39.060 --> 17:42.180
OK. Thank you very much.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.380
- Zhang Lin?
- Hey!

17:59.540 --> 18:01.820
- Aghh!
- Ohh!

18:01.860 --> 18:04.740
Oh, man, I missed you!

18:04.780 --> 18:08.660
- So, what's the story this time?
- Three guesses. - Trump.

18:09.660 --> 18:13.340
An election every four years. No
wonder you cannot get anything done.

18:13.380 --> 18:16.660
This is my brother, Jungwei.

18:20.060 --> 18:23.420
You remember Mel, right?
- Hi. - So good to see you.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.500
And this is my friend, Tess.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.340
I hope it's OK if I join you.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.380
- Of course. Please, sit.
- Thank you.

18:30.420 --> 18:34.020
This is a great place. I hope
you can handle the spicy food.

18:34.060 --> 18:38.900
- I love spicy food!
- Ah, people always say that!

18:39.240 --> 18:45.660
No, I went back to Beijing in 1990.
Zhang Lin was trying to teach me some Mandarin,

18:45.700 --> 18:47.980
but I didn't get very far.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.380
- Have you ever been to New York?
- What for?

18:52.420 --> 18:55.540
Starbucks, cockroaches,
we have both of those here.

18:55.580 --> 18:59.340
Hey, I teach Crazy English now.
Did I tell you?

18:59.380 --> 19:03.060
I take my students to the roof.
We yell English into the sky.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.060
You shout, you learn, you conquer
English to make China stronger.

19:07.100 --> 19:11.820
It's got sort of a fascist aspect,
but it helps with the conjugation.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.540
Tomorrow, hi! This is Tomorrow,
she's one of my pupils.

19:16.580 --> 19:22.340
- Hi. - You... the famous photograph?
- Me? Am I famous? No.

19:22.380 --> 19:25.300
No, I took one pretty famous photo.

19:27.740 --> 19:29.780
You wanna see it? OK.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.300
Erm... here it is.

19:38.340 --> 19:41.300
I took it in Tiananmen Square
in 1989.

19:42.820 --> 19:45.220
After the protest

19:46.220 --> 19:49.540
Hm, I don't know. Sorry.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.380
I think we were followed today.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.820
Probably. You're a journalist.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.420
You don't think it's weird?
It's never happened to me before.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.140
You mean you never noticed before.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.260
Excuse me.

20:10.260 --> 20:11.900
Joy!

20:11.940 --> 20:15.860
- Hey. - Hey! You caught us.
- Don't be silly, I'll have one.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.740
- Who was that?
- Who?

20:26.780 --> 20:29.460
Oh, Joy.
That's my neighbour's daughter.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.620
Hmm! Do you fancy her?

20:31.660 --> 20:36.140
No, she's... she's married.
She lives in Hong Kong.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.820
Too smart for me.
She's a human rights lawyer.

20:40.860 --> 20:45.460
- Ah! - Yeah. Anyway, I don't think, er...
I don't think I'll marry again.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.660
Zhang Lin's wife died.

20:47.700 --> 20:51.820
- I'm sorry, I didn't realise.
- It happened a long time ago.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.900
So how did you get together?

20:55.460 --> 20:59.020
- Do you know a band called Wham?
- Yeah.

20:59.060 --> 21:01.860
They played a concert here.
I bought tickets.

21:01.900 --> 21:04.620
Then my girlfriend broke up with me.

21:04.660 --> 21:08.620
I met Liuli the next day.
I took her instead.

21:09.820 --> 21:12.380
- That was our first date.
- You never told me that.

21:12.420 --> 21:15.620
I've seen that concert.
There was a documentary on YouTube.

21:15.660 --> 21:19.020
They show the whole crowd. Maybe
you're in it! You've gotta check.

21:19.060 --> 21:23.100
Ah, we can't access that site.
YouTube is blocked here.

21:23.140 --> 21:26.060
- You like Wham?
- Do I like Wham? I love Wham.

21:26.100 --> 21:29.140
I spent the 80s planning my wedding
to George Michael.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.900
What is your point?

21:33.780 --> 21:37.540
I'm just saying, there was a massacre
right here in Tiananmen Square

21:37.580 --> 21:40.900
and the guy still had the courage to
stand up and say, "This is wrong."

21:40.940 --> 21:45.980
And what did he have? Nothing.
He had a couple of plastic grocery bags, that's it.

21:46.020 --> 21:48.140
He was a clown!

21:49.180 --> 21:51.300
He wasn't a clown.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.620
- I was there, too.
- Yes.

21:54.660 --> 21:58.140
Up in a hotel room taking pictures,
behind your camera.

21:58.180 --> 22:01.020
I was here in the square, OK?

22:01.060 --> 22:03.980
Bullets the size of your thumb, yes?
Dumdums.

22:04.020 --> 22:06.100
They turned the lights out on us.

22:07.260 --> 22:09.580
Don't you think it's weird that
nobody would know anything?

22:09.581 --> 22:11.900
The Tank Man?
Are we still on that?

22:11.940 --> 22:14.100
That waitress, she worked
five minutes from the square,

22:14.101 --> 22:16.260
she didn't even know
people were killed there.

22:17.500 --> 22:22.340
Bad journalism. Most of them weren't
even killed in the square. - OK, OK!

22:22.380 --> 22:25.300
But she never even heard
of the Tank Man!

22:31.180 --> 22:34.500
Ahhh! What's with you tonight, huh?
Tank Man, Tank Man.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.820
What did he do?
He stood in the road.

22:36.860 --> 22:39.060
My wife, she sat in that
square for two whole months!

22:39.061 --> 22:41.260
Right, you were there,
you must have heard something.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.196
Over the years, you never heard anything,
nobody ever said anything to you?

22:44.220 --> 22:46.220
I heard he went to America!

22:50.420 --> 22:52.100
What?

22:55.700 --> 22:58.260
- Wait, wait, what are you...
- New York.

22:59.820 --> 23:02.140
Many people moved there after.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.700
By August,
most of my friends were gone.

23:06.980 --> 23:09.420
Are you serious?

23:09.460 --> 23:15.580
I thought... I thought that he was...
I thought he would've been dead. This is...

23:17.540 --> 23:19.540
Do you have his name?

23:19.541 --> 23:22.460
He'll have changed it.
He'll be called Brian Simpson or...

23:22.500 --> 23:24.900
No, do you know what his name is?

23:27.700 --> 23:29.980
Please, do you have it?

23:32.980 --> 23:35.260
Wang Pengfei.

23:49.380 --> 23:52.580
Wang Pengfei, like P-E-N-G...

23:58.100 --> 24:01.300
He went to art school with Liuli.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.940
He got his place there
by painting a perfect copy

24:03.980 --> 24:06.140
of Van Gogh's Sunflowers.

24:07.420 --> 24:09.580
Nice guy.

24:12.020 --> 24:14.380
I can't believe that
you never told me this.

24:17.660 --> 24:20.100
You're a foreign journalist, Lee.

24:22.100 --> 24:26.260
You know how careful I have to be
when you come to visit, hm?

24:29.100 --> 24:31.140
I like to live quiet.

24:32.660 --> 24:36.580
Anyway, it was 30 years ago.
Who cares?

24:36.620 --> 24:40.420
Don't you have other things to worry
about, like, er, democracy?

24:40.460 --> 24:42.980
It's... What's the English word?
...fucked.

24:45.220 --> 24:47.340
What, you don't like Trump?

24:48.780 --> 24:51.020
I like Clinton.

24:51.060 --> 24:53.460
Women hold up half the sky.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.780
Drink.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.220
Welcome back.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.580
The Tank Man is dead.

25:29.620 --> 25:33.500
You don't think this friend of yours is,
let's be civil, feeding you a crock of shit?

25:33.540 --> 25:37.220
I actually think we might have
something. We have this guy's name.

25:37.260 --> 25:39.760
- Wang Pengfei.
- Ah, right.

25:39.771 --> 25:42.940
And this name was given
to you by how many people?

25:42.980 --> 25:45.260
Lee's friend, Zhang Lin.

25:45.300 --> 25:48.420
And this person, he's in the army?
The party?

25:48.460 --> 25:50.180
He teaches Crazy English.

25:50.220 --> 25:55.180
Excellent. So he has access to the
really high-level intelligence, then.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.580
Anyway, he's dead.

26:00.020 --> 26:03.860
I pulled the clips. This is by our
Beijing correspondent at the time.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.980
The headline is quite unequivocal.

26:06.020 --> 26:10.780
It can't be quite unequivocal.
It is or it isn't. There's no scale.

26:14.820 --> 26:17.580
Maybe that headline's wrong.
I've never heard of it.

26:17.620 --> 26:19.740
How long do we have
before Lou gets here?

26:20.740 --> 26:23.900
That's her. That's her?

26:25.500 --> 26:28.320
- What is she doing?
- She's inspiring us to sit differently.

26:28.321 --> 26:31.140
She wants to encourage younger voices.

26:31.180 --> 26:33.940
- Does it work?
- Yeah.

26:33.980 --> 26:37.860
Frank, it's that girl again. She's
called three times this morning.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.300
Tell her I'll call her back!

26:39.301 --> 26:42.700
She says if you don't take it,
she's gonna call Lou direct.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.660
Alex Sguerra, photojournalist,
know her?

26:45.700 --> 26:50.980
Me, neither. Had to Google her. She's about 12.
Works for VICE. Wears a lot of hats.

26:53.780 --> 26:59.380
Alex Sguerra says if you magnify this by
200, the manipulation is obvious.

26:59.420 --> 27:03.380
So we could do that and turn this
into an official investigation.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.740
Or you can just tell me
what you did.

27:23.180 --> 27:25.500
It's two shots.
I spliced them together.

27:37.020 --> 27:41.620
I just... I-I-I don't know what I was thinking.
I didn't even really mean to send it. - Ohh.

27:42.820 --> 27:44.940
Does Lou know?

27:44.980 --> 27:46.900
- Not yet.
- Does she have to?

27:46.940 --> 27:50.580
I've never done anything like this before.
There's no quiet way of doing this.

27:51.580 --> 27:53.980
We have to print a correction.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.860
We have to weather
the shit storm that follows.

27:56.900 --> 28:02.620
And I have to call every editor in the country and
apologise cos you've made all of us look dirty,

28:02.660 --> 28:06.780
right at the moment we need
more than ever to be immaculate.

28:10.060 --> 28:14.380
You've played right into his
tiny hands. You know that, right?

28:16.020 --> 28:20.100
I can't afford to give you anything
less than a public execution right now.

28:20.140 --> 28:22.300
Frank, please, it was a great shot.

28:22.340 --> 28:25.580
Sure. Kind of shot that wins
a Pulitzer. If it's real.

28:26.700 --> 28:30.340
It was real! It happened!
It's true or it isn't!

28:30.380 --> 28:35.780
Alteration is not an option! Yeah, well,
apparently it's the only way to get Syria on the front page.

28:35.820 --> 28:39.860
Week after week, I send you unthinkable
atrocities, and you bury them on page 12.

28:43.060 --> 28:47.700
You're gonna wanna write an apology. A good one.
I can help you with that. But this...

28:51.180 --> 28:53.060
We're done, son.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.800
- Excuse me!
- Don't worry, I won't be long.

29:37.801 --> 29:40.540
- You can't just...
- Alex? Alex Sguerra? Anybody? Alex?

29:42.260 --> 29:45.300
- Alex? Lee Berger.
- I know who you are. Hi.

29:45.340 --> 29:47.340
Look, do you wanna go somewhere?

29:47.341 --> 29:51.020
No, I just wanna say,
I hope when you're doing your important work,

29:51.060 --> 29:55.220
covering which music festival is the best to get
herpes at, you feel fucking proud of yourself.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.140
Dude, do you think I like this, either?

29:57.180 --> 29:58.880
I've looked up to you my whole career.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.260
I had the Tank Man pasted on my
bedroom wall. - No, no, no.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.500
What I do has nothing to do
with what you do.

30:03.540 --> 30:09.140
You don't have a career. You have a couple of
dumb trips to Cambodia that your daddy paid for.

30:09.180 --> 30:11.180
I work for a newspaper!

30:11.220 --> 30:14.340
We take bets on when the first VICE kid
is gonna get their head chopped off!

30:14.380 --> 30:18.020
- Worked.
- Excuse me?

30:18.060 --> 30:22.300
You worked for a newspaper.
Past tense, right?

32:24.900 --> 32:28.220
# I was dreaming but I should've
been with you instead

32:28.260 --> 32:31.100
# Wake me up before you go-go

32:31.140 --> 32:34.100
# Don't leave me hanging on
like a yo-yo

32:34.140 --> 32:37.060
# Wake me up before you go-go

32:37.100 --> 32:39.740
# I don't wanna miss it
when you hit that high

32:39.780 --> 32:42.900
# Wake me up before you go-go

32:42.940 --> 32:46.020
# Cos I'm not planning on going solo

32:46.060 --> 32:48.660
â™ª Wake me up before you go-go â™ª

35:13.320 --> 35:17.080
"These vicious claims about me

35:17.120 --> 35:20.560
of inappropriate conduct with women

35:20.600 --> 35:24.040
are totally and absolutely false."

35:24.080 --> 35:28.920
'I'd like to apologise for the mistake
I made manipulating the photograph.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.320
I've always behaved ethically

35:31.360 --> 35:34.360
and this was a single, catastrophic
error of judgement.

35:34.400 --> 35:40.400
I deeply regret that I sullied the
reputation of my newspaper and my friends.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.240
Journalists are not liars.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.920
They seek truth, and right now,
we need them more than ever.'

35:47.920 --> 35:50.720
I cannot expect my colleagues
to forgive me.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.000
I only hope that they will recognise this happened
under the pressure of rolling half-hour deadlines

35:55.040 --> 35:58.120
and the demands of a readership which
has become desensitised to anything

35:58.160 --> 36:00.240
but the most arresting images.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.160
Cut the last sentence.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.240
But it's true.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.280
I know.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.160
But cut it.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.720
Yeah.
So it's been kind of a bad day.

36:37.760 --> 36:42.120
- I mean, that really is shitty.
- Yeah.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.040
So, when did you fly in?

36:44.080 --> 36:47.680
Four hours ago. Can't you tell?

36:47.720 --> 36:50.760
- You like working over there?
- It's the only country I've ever been to

36:50.800 --> 36:53.920
where I feel like they genuinely
don't give a shit about us,

36:53.960 --> 36:56.080
like, at all. Erm...

37:00.640 --> 37:02.720
Wow!

37:02.760 --> 37:06.760
- You're a fast learner, huh? - I've been studying
at night, taking a lot of caffeine pills.

37:06.800 --> 37:10.960
My piss is orange. I have to admit
something really terrible.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.560
Worse than your piss being orange?

37:13.600 --> 37:15.880
I Googled you.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.160
I Googled you, too.

37:19.200 --> 37:23.960
What's netball? And why do they make you
wear such short skirts when you play it?

37:29.280 --> 37:31.560
Sorry. Just...

37:31.600 --> 37:34.000
You know this is a work thing,
right?

37:38.240 --> 37:41.640
- This is really awkward now, isn't it?
- No. Not at all. Don't worry about it.

37:41.680 --> 37:47.240
- I literally just got divorced. I'm not really looking for...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's fine.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.520
- Excuse me, can I get another one
of those? Thanks. - Sure thing.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.360
So, what do you wanna talk about?

38:04.400 --> 38:06.320
OK.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.080
Erm, so...

38:09.120 --> 38:15.640
the credit card company I work for are looking
for some artwork for the card, and I found...

38:18.720 --> 38:21.520
...this. It's yours.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.960
Well, I would like to license it.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.120
For a credit card?
No. I don't think so.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.400
And, anyway, that river
that those kids are fishing in

38:34.440 --> 38:38.880
is one of the most polluted rivers in the world.
The child mortality rate is, like, through the roof.

38:38.920 --> 38:43.240
- It's a great image. - Yeah, there's a ceiling
on how much I wanna make off a bunch of kids

38:43.280 --> 38:46.816
- dying in a developing country. - I'm sorry you
lost your job, but don't take it out on me.

38:46.840 --> 38:50.200
- Don't do that. That's not what I'm
talking about. - Why are you angry?

38:50.240 --> 38:52.480
Because I slept with you
and I don't wanna do it again?

38:52.520 --> 38:55.120
Cos it's the worst day of my life
and I'm dining with Ayn Rand.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.240
And actually,
bullshit you didn't wanna...

38:59.600 --> 39:04.000
"Hey, Lee, can I buy you dinner?
I promise not to have sex with you. Call me."

39:04.040 --> 39:06.840
I'm not sure how I could have been
more explicit.

39:06.880 --> 39:11.680
Oh, my God! This is, like,
the least subtle email I've ever gotten in my life.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.520
Look, I know you're having
a tough time, but honestly...

39:15.560 --> 39:19.920
...we Photoshop everything,
all the time. So what?

39:19.960 --> 39:22.160
So what if the Tank Man
was Photoshopped?

39:22.200 --> 39:24.200
It's still an amazing image, right?

39:24.240 --> 39:27.120
It'd still be saying something.
It'd still be true.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.880
Are you out of your fucking mind?

39:39.280 --> 39:42.360
"Journalists are not liars.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.440
They seek truth.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.960
And right now,
we need them more than ever."

41:16.000 --> 41:20.920
You know there are a ton of people right
now shitting on you from a great height,

41:20.960 --> 41:26.240
and I just want you to know, those people
have exactly zero fucking right to do that

41:26.280 --> 41:29.440
cos those people were never in
a combat zone in their whole life.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.320
- OK. Thank you.
- But I was.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.080
I have been in 12 combat zones.

41:39.120 --> 41:43.400
So when I shit on you, it counts.
OK?

41:43.440 --> 41:48.640
I don't care how hot or dusty it was,
or how much sleep you weren't getting,

41:48.680 --> 41:52.520
- there is no excuse for what you did!
- I'm sorry.

41:52.560 --> 41:55.720
I hope you like eating
leftover shrimp in a catering tin

41:55.760 --> 41:59.200
cos you're gonna be a wedding photographer
for the rest of your fucking life, Lee!

41:59.240 --> 42:02.600
- I know. - Do you know
you have broken my heart?

42:10.400 --> 42:12.480
He's not dead.

42:14.840 --> 42:19.160
- Are you serious right now?
- No, just listen to me. Listen to me.

42:19.200 --> 42:23.160
We knew that after Tiananmen, there have
been public executions on TV every day,

42:23.200 --> 42:26.400
- people who'd embarrassed the party
a lot less than that guy. - Yeah. So?

42:26.440 --> 42:28.560
So it doesn't make any sense.

42:28.600 --> 42:32.880
If the party had got him, they definitely
would've made sure that every TV viewer in China

42:32.920 --> 42:37.520
had seen that bullet go through his head. The image
would've gone round the world, and there'snothing.

42:38.600 --> 42:42.040
I get a photo of the Tank Man...

42:42.080 --> 42:44.720
alive and well
and sitting in Central Park,

42:44.760 --> 42:48.040
you don't think every newspaper in the
world is gonna open its doors to me?

42:48.080 --> 42:51.480
Even if you got that photo,
you know what happens.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.720
Everyone thinks it's a fake.

42:53.760 --> 42:57.360
In news, you don't have anything
except your credibility.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.680
- And you don't have that any more.
- I know, but you do.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.560
No. No!

43:03.600 --> 43:08.080
- So what do you think? - I think he's
fired and you have an election to cover.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.320
You know,
this isn't just about the Tank Man.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.600
This is about a government crushing
one of the biggest protests in history.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.720
Zhang Lin, he lost his wife.

43:19.720 --> 43:22.900
She was shot in the street and nobody
remembers. But if the Tank Man is alive...

43:22.910 --> 43:25.800
There's not a shred of evidence
the Public Security Bureau took him.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.320
- You had a name, right?
- Wang Pengfei.

43:29.360 --> 43:33.600
- Nothing else? - He painted a perfect
copy of Van Gogh's Sunflowers.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.520
Well... it's not nothing.

43:40.480 --> 43:44.840
This is extracurricular, OK? You still put
the newspaper first. And you, be careful.

43:44.880 --> 43:48.400
If Lou hears you're anywhere near
this, it's my head on a plate.

43:48.440 --> 43:52.360
She only hates you
cos you're a Republican.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.640
Like I haven't been punished enough.

43:58.600 --> 44:02.560
Wake me up before you go-go.

44:02.600 --> 44:06.920
Take me... dancing... tonight.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.160
I want to hit that high.

44:19.800 --> 44:23.920
Wake me up before you go-go.

44:23.960 --> 44:28.240
Don't leave me hanging on
like a yo-yo.

45:35.120 --> 45:38.200
When we find him, what's the first
question you're gonna ask?

45:40.320 --> 45:45.200
- OK. One, what did he say
to the soldier in the tank? - Mm-hm.

45:45.240 --> 45:49.120
Two, what were in his shopping bags?

45:55.640 --> 45:59.160
"Your New York City forecast here
on this Tuesday morning..." - Hey.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:10.960 --> 46:13.680
Hey!
