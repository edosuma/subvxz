01:12.739 --> 01:15.813
Men are such beasts.

01:15.814 --> 01:19.791
Is it Eliot, that new fella you 
just met ?

01:19.792 --> 01:21.897
Don't ever mention his name again.

01:21.898 --> 01:23.903
His idea of a double date

01:23.904 --> 01:26.309
was showing up with
another girlfriend.

01:26.310 --> 01:29.252
Irma, the problem is you're too eager.

01:29.253 --> 01:32.661
You'd never see me jump
the moment a man calls.

01:32.662 --> 01:34.734
April !

01:34.735 --> 01:35.937
Get in here.

01:35.938 --> 01:38.077
Yes, mr. Thompson.
Coming right away.

01:38.078 --> 01:39.748
Oh, brother.

01:41.855 --> 01:43.425
What's up, sir ?

01:43.426 --> 01:46.768
The night watchman
at Cybertek Laboratories

01:46.769 --> 01:48.674
spotted some weird
character hanging around.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.214
Could he be a friend of
those turtles of yours ?

01:51.215 --> 01:52.953
I seriously doubt it.

01:52.954 --> 01:54.757
Well, why don't you go over

01:54.758 --> 01:56.429
and see if there's a story's in it ?

01:56.430 --> 01:58.335
I'm practically there.

01:58.336 --> 02:00.674
Where are you going ?

02:00.675 --> 02:03.349
I'm not finished complaining 
about men yet.

02:03.350 --> 02:06.257
Later, Irma.
I'm onto something hot.

02:06.258 --> 02:08.564
Find out if he wants to double date...

02:08.565 --> 02:09.834
With the two of us.

02:13.712 --> 02:15.884
Well, guys, what do you think

02:15.885 --> 02:17.556
of my latest invention ?

02:17.557 --> 02:20.464
It's, uh, swell, Donatello.

02:20.465 --> 02:22.804
Yeah.
Tubuloso !

02:22.805 --> 02:25.746
But, like, what's it do ?

02:25.747 --> 02:27.986
It's a super-fast pizza maker.

02:27.987 --> 02:29.891
It cuts cooking time in half.

02:29.892 --> 02:32.298
It is most impressive, Donatello.

02:32.299 --> 02:34.303
How does it work ?

02:34.304 --> 02:36.343
I was hoping you'd ask that, sensei.

02:36.344 --> 02:37.647
Watch.

02:41.927 --> 02:54.261
All you do is add the ingredients.

02:54.262 --> 02:55.498
It works !

02:55.499 --> 02:57.637
Now to take a test drive.

03:01.214 --> 03:04.056
This is delicious, Donatello.

03:04.057 --> 03:06.562
Yeah. Primo to the extremo.

03:06.563 --> 03:09.705
Hey, now throw it into high gear.

03:09.706 --> 03:12.011
You asked for it.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.740
Weird topping, dude.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.817
Looks like problems in pizza town.

03:25.818 --> 03:27.690
Head for cover, turtles.

03:33.841 --> 03:36.415
Sorry about that, guys.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.253
I guess it still has
a few loose screws.

03:38.254 --> 03:40.526
Yeah. Just like
the guy who invented it.

03:40.527 --> 03:42.030
Were you injured, Leonardo ?

03:42.031 --> 03:43.368
Just a bruise, master.

03:43.369 --> 03:44.438
I'll be fine.

03:45.542 --> 03:46.777
The turtle com.

03:46.778 --> 03:49.452
Emergency, guys.
I'm at cybertek labs.

03:49.453 --> 03:50.755
What's wrong, April ?

03:50.756 --> 03:51.959
I'm not sure yet,

03:51.960 --> 03:54.700
but Shredder and his goonies
are part of it.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.973
Hang tight, April.
We're on our way.

03:56.974 --> 03:59.379
You heard her, turtles.
Let's go !

03:59.380 --> 04:00.917
I am coming with you.

04:00.918 --> 04:01.887
But, master Splinter--

04:01.888 --> 04:04.428
You are injured. Perhaps I can

04:04.429 --> 04:06.767
if it comes to an unfriendly encounter.

04:06.768 --> 04:10.043
Ok, guys.
Just act natural.

04:10.044 --> 04:12.250
Hurry, you dolt.

04:12.251 --> 04:15.927
Oh, this thing's heavy, boss.

04:15.928 --> 04:17.265
You...

04:22.814 --> 04:25.889
Bebop, you...

04:25.890 --> 04:28.764
April O'Neill.
Get her !

04:35.050 --> 04:36.887
This is not working out
the way I planned.

04:36.888 --> 04:40.129
Time to sign off,
you nosy news hen.

04:42.605 --> 04:44.342
What ? The turtles !

04:44.343 --> 04:47.818
Oh, you're pretty bright, can-head.

04:50.828 --> 04:54.036
You won't find me
as easy to conquer.

04:54.037 --> 04:55.774
We shall soon see.

04:59.252 --> 05:01.123
Quick, April. Jump !

05:01.124 --> 05:03.396
Don't sweat it.
I'll catch you.

05:03.397 --> 05:06.003
If you say so.

05:08.512 --> 05:11.887
Oh, I really dig going around with you.

05:15.030 --> 05:17.570
Let's blast those shell-backs.

05:21.382 --> 05:24.456
Watch where you're shooting,
you mutant morons.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.264
Say bye-bye, ratso.

05:32.279 --> 05:35.019
Oh, now I have you.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.524
I'll take that.

05:36.525 --> 05:38.497
Wrong, tin-grin.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.917
You eat laser bolts, turtle.

05:56.415 --> 05:59.422
The boss is hurt.

05:59.423 --> 06:02.631
We got to get him outta here.

06:07.948 --> 06:09.318
Shredder's getting away.

06:09.319 --> 06:12.427
Never mind. We've gotta
help master Splinter.

06:15.336 --> 06:17.006
Easy now.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.413
Let's grab this catering truck.

06:19.414 --> 06:23.491
Yeah. That way,
we can eat and run.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.703
Are you ok, boss ?

06:27.704 --> 06:29.375
What--what happened ?

06:29.376 --> 06:30.913
How did I arrive here ?

06:30.914 --> 06:32.450
Hey, relax, boss.

06:32.451 --> 06:35.492
We got away from
the turtles and that rat.

06:35.493 --> 06:36.796
Boss ?

06:36.797 --> 06:40.072
Sure. You're Shredder.
Ain't ya ?

06:42.413 --> 06:44.116
It would appear that I am.

06:45.388 --> 06:46.892
You coming with us, April ?

06:46.893 --> 06:50.134
No. I want to get back
and file this story. Ciao !

06:52.007 --> 06:55.015
Are you all right, master Splinter ?

06:55.016 --> 06:57.421
Of course, you fools.

06:57.422 --> 07:00.330
I--wait.
What did you call me ?

07:00.331 --> 07:02.335
Master splinter, of course.

07:02.336 --> 07:03.940
That's your name.

07:03.941 --> 07:05.946
<i>I'm in Splinter's body.</i>

07:05.947 --> 07:07.751
<i>The accident at the lab,</i>

07:07.752 --> 07:11.027
<i>some kind of neuron mind transfer.</i>

07:11.028 --> 07:13.467
I'm fine, my turtles.

07:13.468 --> 07:16.843
I was a bit shaken up
by the accident.

07:16.844 --> 07:19.083
Hey, no problemo.
We'll get you back

07:19.084 --> 07:21.256
To the sewers
At warp speed.

07:21.257 --> 07:23.062
That's what
I would like,

07:23.063 --> 07:24.398
My pupils,

07:24.399 --> 07:27.006
Exactly what
I would like.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.639
Hey, boss, you want
Some jelly beans ?

07:38.640 --> 07:40.644
No, thank you.

07:40.645 --> 07:43.252
Huh ? Did you
Hear that ?

07:43.253 --> 07:44.656
Hey, what's up ?

07:44.657 --> 07:47.197
He's actually
Nice to you.

07:47.198 --> 07:49.604
Uh, i mean shut up,

07:49.605 --> 07:51.408
You scrofulous
Ignoramus.

07:51.409 --> 07:53.816
Yeah. That's
More like it.

07:55.220 --> 07:57.493
<I>when shredder and i
<I>were hit by that beam,

07:57.494 --> 08:00.201
<I>it must somehow have switched
<I>our personalities,

08:00.202 --> 08:04.513
<I>which means that shredder
<I>must be in my body.

08:07.657 --> 08:11.800
All aboard for
The technodrome shuttle.

08:11.801 --> 08:14.174
We better hurry, boss.

08:14.175 --> 08:15.879
We're running late.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.383
<I>this is my opportunity

08:17.384 --> 08:19.690
<I>to find out where
<I>the technodrome is.

08:19.691 --> 08:21.628
<I>i cannot pass it up.

08:21.629 --> 08:25.205
I give the orders
Around here, hog breath.

08:25.206 --> 08:27.010
I love this part.

08:29.017 --> 08:30.955
<I>i hope the turtles

08:30.956 --> 08:34.298
<I>are able to recognize
<I>shredder's mind in my body.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.068
<I>i must find a way
<I>to help them.

08:37.308 --> 08:40.549
Leonardo, i'm feeling
Much better now.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.722
Cannot i remove
This cold compress

08:42.722 --> 08:43.725
From my eyes ?

08:43.726 --> 08:45.530
It's for your own good,
Master.

08:45.531 --> 08:47.536
It'll make the swelling
Go down.

08:48.674 --> 08:51.146
Sewer,
Sweet sewer.

08:51.147 --> 08:54.155
<I>so this
<I>is the turtles' lair.

08:54.156 --> 08:56.696
<I>too bad i wasn't able
<I>to keep track of the route

08:56.697 --> 08:59.503
<I>through the sewers with
<I>this towel over my eyes.

08:59.504 --> 09:01.008
<I>no matter.

09:01.009 --> 09:04.384
<I>i won't leave here until
<I>they're all destroyed.

09:04.385 --> 09:07.225
How about we munch
Some lunch, compadres ?

09:07.226 --> 09:10.066
As you would say,
Mondo notion, dudes.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.872
Oh, i'm starved.

09:11.873 --> 09:14.613
Give me
A piece of that.

09:15.851 --> 09:18.190
Oh, most delicious.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.165
Well, what are
You looking at ?

09:21.166 --> 09:23.171
Well, sorry,
Master splinter,

09:23.172 --> 09:25.310
But we thought
You hated pizza.

09:25.311 --> 09:29.221
Is this how you show
Respect for your mentor,

09:29.222 --> 09:31.194
By questioning
His actions ?

09:31.195 --> 09:32.732
Gee. We're sorry,
Master.

09:32.733 --> 09:34.002
Enough !

09:34.003 --> 09:36.108
I want you all
To begin practicing

09:36.109 --> 09:37.913
Your ninja exercises.

09:37.914 --> 09:42.493
You never know when
Shredder will strike next.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.431
But--but--

09:44.432 --> 09:46.437
To the exercise room.

09:46.438 --> 09:47.540
Now !

09:54.796 --> 09:56.298
Careful with that.

09:56.299 --> 10:00.310
It's the only electron
Inductoscope we have left.

10:00.311 --> 10:03.820
Well, did you bring me
A thermocouple galvanometer

10:03.821 --> 10:05.959
As i told you ?

10:05.960 --> 10:08.165
There were
Unforeseen difficulties.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.570
Yeah,
In other words,

10:09.571 --> 10:11.074
We ran into
The turtles.

10:11.075 --> 10:13.916
I don't want
To hear this.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.620
Uh, we could've
Beat 'em,

10:15.621 --> 10:17.660
But they wouldn't
Fight dirty.

10:17.661 --> 10:20.735
If i had hands,
I'd cover my ears.

10:20.736 --> 10:22.139
If i had 'em.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.543
Not to worry, krang.

10:23.544 --> 10:25.281
I'll return immediately

10:25.282 --> 10:27.220
And steal the mechanism
You need.

10:27.221 --> 10:28.925
You will ?

10:28.926 --> 10:30.931
Of course. I failed.

10:30.932 --> 10:34.073
It's my responsibility
To correct the error.

10:34.074 --> 10:35.076
Shredder,

10:35.077 --> 10:38.085
Are you certain
You feel all right ?

10:38.086 --> 10:39.288
Absolutely.

10:39.289 --> 10:42.497
In fact, i feel
Like a new person.

10:42.498 --> 10:45.740
<I>i must find a way to
<I>reverse the mind transfer.

10:45.741 --> 10:47.946
<I>and krang might know how,

10:47.947 --> 10:49.785
<I>but how to get him
<I>to tell me

10:49.786 --> 10:52.626
<I>without arousing
<I>his suspicions ?

10:52.627 --> 10:54.164
You know, dudes,

10:54.165 --> 10:56.838
Splinter's acting
Hyper-weird.

10:56.839 --> 11:00.014
I wonder if anything
We did upset him.

11:00.015 --> 11:02.354
Enough of this child's play.

11:02.355 --> 11:05.797
I will show you how
A true ninja fights.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.201
Attack me.

11:07.202 --> 11:09.274
Are you sure, master ?

11:09.275 --> 11:12.182
I said, "attack" !

11:12.183 --> 11:13.318
<I>hai !

11:21.844 --> 11:24.752
Obviously you have not
Been practicing enough.

11:24.753 --> 11:28.929
You will do each exercise
10 times.

11:28.930 --> 11:31.570
I can destroy them
Whenever i wish,

11:31.571 --> 11:34.378
And afterwards,
Krang can find a way

11:34.379 --> 11:37.287
To return me
To my real body.

11:37.288 --> 11:40.797
Oh, man, he whipped
Our shells but good.

11:40.798 --> 11:42.101
Oh, there's
Something strange.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.806
I know <I>sensei's
Fighting style,

11:43.807 --> 11:45.477
And that wasn't it.

11:45.478 --> 11:48.486
Yeah. You know who
It reminded me of ?

11:48.487 --> 11:50.157
Shredder ?
Shredder ?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.773
Tell me, krang,
Are you familiar

11:55.774 --> 11:58.147
With the theory
Of mind transference ?

11:58.148 --> 12:00.219
Mm, quite difficult,

12:00.220 --> 12:01.857
But with the
Proper equipment,

12:01.858 --> 12:03.729
Not impossible.

12:03.730 --> 12:06.972
And do we have
The necessary equipment

12:06.973 --> 12:08.576
Here in the technodrome ?

12:08.577 --> 12:10.081
Maybe, maybe not.

12:10.082 --> 12:12.086
Why do you ask ?

12:12.087 --> 12:15.363
Oh, uh...just
Scientific curiosity.

12:15.364 --> 12:18.772
You're acting very
Strangely, shredder.

12:18.773 --> 12:21.780
I'm just not myself today.

12:21.781 --> 12:23.619
Well, maybe it was
Getting zapped

12:23.620 --> 12:26.294
With that funny ray
What did it, boss.

12:26.295 --> 12:29.201
Ray...what ray ?

12:29.202 --> 12:32.311
Uh...nothing.
Just a slight accident.

12:32.312 --> 12:34.818
Slight accidents
With funny rays

12:34.819 --> 12:37.994
Can have serious
Consequences.

12:37.995 --> 12:41.503
Shredder, i think you
Should have a brain scan

12:41.504 --> 12:44.512
Just to make certain
You're all right.

12:44.513 --> 12:50.261
That's not necessary,
Krang.

12:50.262 --> 12:52.902
This really is
A waste of time, krang.

12:52.903 --> 12:57.181
I'll be the judge of that.
Now, will you hold still ?

12:57.182 --> 12:59.922
This won't hurt...much.

12:59.923 --> 13:03.834
This is shredder's
Brain wave pattern.

13:03.835 --> 13:06.776
Now to see
If yours matches it.

13:06.777 --> 13:09.149
<I>as soon as he sees
<I>a different brainwave pattern,

13:09.150 --> 13:11.288
<I>he'll know i'm not shredder.

13:11.289 --> 13:15.668
<I>then i fear the rat
<I>will be out of the bag.

13:24.394 --> 13:28.905
This second brain wave
Pattern looks unfamiliar.

13:30.411 --> 13:32.649
<I>must control my brain waves.

13:32.650 --> 13:34.589
<I>make them match shredder's.

13:35.826 --> 13:38.901
It appears that
I spoke too soon.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.906
The patterns do match.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.410
You understand,
Shredder,

13:42.411 --> 13:45.051
One can't be
Too careful.

13:45.052 --> 13:46.924
I understand.

13:46.925 --> 13:49.531
Perhaps now we could
Continue our talk

13:49.532 --> 13:51.035
About the mind
Transfer process.

13:51.036 --> 13:54.612
I have no time
For theoretical discussions

13:54.613 --> 13:57.655
When the technodrome
Needs repairs so badly.

13:57.656 --> 14:00.696
I want that
Thermocouple galvanometer.

14:00.697 --> 14:02.301
As you wish.

14:02.302 --> 14:06.313
Wait ! Take bebop and
Rock steady with you...

14:06.314 --> 14:07.482
Please.

14:07.483 --> 14:09.254
Come on, you two.

14:09.255 --> 14:11.695
We're going
Back to the surface.

14:11.696 --> 14:14.168
What a double cross
To bear.

14:15.473 --> 14:17.277
This is the second
Time today

14:17.278 --> 14:19.383
Master splinter's
Made us do this.

14:19.384 --> 14:20.686
Do you turtles
Get the feeling

14:20.687 --> 14:22.826
That there's something,
Well, not right

14:22.827 --> 14:24.430
About master splinter ?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.533
I've always
Had that feeling.

14:25.534 --> 14:27.573
Hi, guys.

14:27.574 --> 14:30.915
Wow. The place is
Really looking good.

14:30.916 --> 14:33.924
April o'neill,
What are you doing here ?

14:33.925 --> 14:36.599
I just wanted to see
How you were doing.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.273
Just fine.
Now leave.

14:39.274 --> 14:41.279
The turtles have no time
To chatter

14:41.280 --> 14:42.783
With the likes of you.

14:42.784 --> 14:43.987
Sorry, guys.

14:43.988 --> 14:46.493
Looks like i'm not
Welcome here today.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.964
I'll leave.

14:47.965 --> 14:50.672
Wait up. We're
Coming with you.

14:50.673 --> 14:52.177
There's something
Definitely wrong

14:52.178 --> 14:53.848
With master splinter.

14:53.849 --> 14:57.224
<I>i've set the coordinates
<I>to the location of our lai.

14:57.225 --> 15:00.133
<I>i must convince the turtles
<I>of who i really am.

15:01.371 --> 15:03.376
Master splinter's
Been acting strangely

15:03.377 --> 15:06.283
Since our last battle
With shredder.

15:06.284 --> 15:09.058
Yeah. Hey,
Like maybe

15:09.059 --> 15:11.297
That bizarro ray
That zapped him

15:11.298 --> 15:12.802
Has something
To do with it.

15:12.803 --> 15:14.808
That could be,
Michaelangelo.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.187
Look out !

15:19.188 --> 15:21.226
Holy guacamole.

15:21.227 --> 15:22.731
What's that ?

15:22.732 --> 15:26.240
Some kind of subterranean
Transport device.

15:26.241 --> 15:29.751
Surprise,
Shells for brains.

15:29.752 --> 15:31.689
Yeah, you can't go
Anywhere in this town

15:31.690 --> 15:33.260
Without running
Into riffraff.

15:33.261 --> 15:36.168
No. Wait ! There's
No need to fight.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.876
Like heck there
Isn't, shredder.

15:40.448 --> 15:43.958
We're gonna turn you
Into turtle stew.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.379
What a story !

15:51.380 --> 15:54.153
All right,
Pack it in, porkface.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.658
You're history.

15:57.162 --> 16:00.672
Aah--aah--aah...
Whoa !

16:00.673 --> 16:02.310
Had enough ?

16:02.311 --> 16:03.848
You want me, bebop ?

16:03.849 --> 16:05.586
Come and get me.

16:10.267 --> 16:12.840
Wait ! You must
Listen to me.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.013
Not a chance, shredder.

16:15.014 --> 16:16.718
Please, try
To understand.

16:16.719 --> 16:18.021
I'm not really
Shredder.

16:18.022 --> 16:19.626
I'm splinter.

16:19.627 --> 16:23.370
You must think
We're real airheads.

16:23.371 --> 16:24.741
Listen to me,
Turtles.

16:24.742 --> 16:26.746
I have always
Taught you to look

16:26.747 --> 16:29.220
Beneath the surface
For the inner truth.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.794
See with your hearts,
Not with your eyes.

16:31.795 --> 16:34.736
Then if you still
Do not believe me,

16:34.737 --> 16:37.076
Do with me
As you will.

16:37.077 --> 16:38.981
You know,
Call me crazy,

16:38.982 --> 16:40.987
But somehow
I believe him.

16:40.988 --> 16:43.460
If you're crazy,
Then you're not the only one.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.433
Count me in,
Too, dudes.

16:45.434 --> 16:48.776
It's good to have you back,
Master splinter.

16:48.777 --> 16:50.715
It is good
To be back.

16:50.716 --> 16:54.860
Somehow i never thought i'd be
Shaking hands with shredder.

16:54.861 --> 16:56.364
<I>where could they have gone ?

16:56.365 --> 16:58.136
<I>what if they suspect me ?

16:58.137 --> 17:01.144
<I>impossible. This is
<I>the perfect disguise.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.655
<I>still, best not
<I>to take any more chances.

17:04.656 --> 17:08.733
<I>when they return,
<I>i will destroy them.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.845
And that is how it
Happened, my turtles.

17:12.846 --> 17:15.218
If we can recreate
The accident

17:15.219 --> 17:17.022
And reverse
The polarity,

17:17.023 --> 17:20.031
We can put you both back
In your correct bodies.

17:20.031 --> 17:22.539
But how do we get
Shredder-- i mean, splinter--

17:22.540 --> 17:26.415
I mean, how do we get
Whoever it is back to the lab ?

17:26.416 --> 17:29.191
I've got an idea.
Donatello...

17:32.268 --> 17:36.312
Turtles, how dare you leave
Your chores unfinished ?

17:36.313 --> 17:39.053
Oh, we're sorry, master.
But this is important.

17:39.054 --> 17:40.591
We found shredder.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.764
And this time
We can nail him good.

17:42.765 --> 17:44.602
<I>oh, this is too good
<I>to be true.

17:44.603 --> 17:46.106
<I>if i can capture
<I>splinter,

17:46.107 --> 17:47.410
<I>it will be easy
<I>for krang

17:47.411 --> 17:49.282
<I>to return me
<I>to my own body.

17:49.283 --> 17:50.786
Then, come, my turtles.

17:50.787 --> 17:53.227
There is no time
To lose.

17:57.306 --> 17:59.912
<I>i dislike
<I>destroying property,

17:59.913 --> 18:00.882
<I>but i have no choice.

18:07.268 --> 18:09.273
<I>the mind transfer
<I>machine.

18:09.274 --> 18:12.014
Hey, boss !

18:12.015 --> 18:14.053
What are you two
Doing here ?

18:14.054 --> 18:15.624
[snorts]
We followed you.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.031
Yeah. We was afraid
The turtles might

18:18.032 --> 18:20.070
Come after youse again.

18:20.071 --> 18:22.576
<I>i must get rid of
<I>those two before...

18:22.577 --> 18:24.014
There he is !

18:25.320 --> 18:28.828
Ooh, it's payback time,
Scaleheads.

18:28.829 --> 18:32.772
Great. Those two creepazoids
Are gonna ruin everything.

18:32.773 --> 18:34.177
So what else is new ?

18:34.178 --> 18:36.918
Your turtles are doomed,
My dear rodent.

18:36.919 --> 18:41.565
And so are you.

18:41.566 --> 18:43.637
Until the final
Sword thrust.

18:45.543 --> 18:48.150
You've grown slow
And soft, yoshi.

18:48.151 --> 18:50.657
No, shredder,
Merely more cunning.

18:50.658 --> 18:54.668
Hey ! You can't treat
My boss shredder like that.

18:54.669 --> 18:57.510
<I>ah, the fish has risen
<I>to the bait.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.014
No ! Bebop, wait.

18:59.015 --> 19:01.020
I'm not...

19:03.261 --> 19:07.104
Bebop. You idiot.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.778
<I>now is the chance
<I>i've waited for.

19:09.779 --> 19:14.893
Prepare for ninja revenge,
Infidel dogs.

19:14.894 --> 19:17.634
I think he's been watching
Too many kung fu movies.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.515
Hey, give those back.

19:22.516 --> 19:24.754
Shredder and splinter
Are in position.

19:24.755 --> 19:26.292
We'll hold off rock steady
And bebop

19:26.293 --> 19:28.765
While you make
The mind switch.

19:28.766 --> 19:31.306
Don't worry. We've
Got 'em outnumbered.

19:31.307 --> 19:32.677
Hurry, donatello.

19:32.678 --> 19:34.215
Shredder is waking up.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.788
I'm trying, but this thing's
Still damaged

19:36.789 --> 19:38.528
From the last time.

19:38.529 --> 19:41.602
I got you now !

19:42.773 --> 19:44.545
Happy trails, hornhead.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.656
Oh, great.

19:48.657 --> 19:50.728
Not too swift,
Michelangelo.

19:54.407 --> 19:56.846
Say your prayers, chump.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.918
Look out, donatello !

20:00.959 --> 20:04.602
No !

20:09.818 --> 20:11.755
It's gonna blow !

20:11.756 --> 20:14.998
Come on, boss.
We're outta here.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.937
Quick. Grab splinter.

20:16.938 --> 20:19.444
Right !
Which one is splinter ?

20:19.445 --> 20:21.784
I bet on this one.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.422
Let's make
Turtle tracks.

20:26.197 --> 20:29.038
So, uh, let me get
This straight, boss.

20:29.039 --> 20:30.542
You were Splinter ?

20:30.543 --> 20:33.986
Let me finish.
And Splinter was you ?

20:33.987 --> 20:35.156
Exactly.

20:35.157 --> 20:37.662
Boy, good thing
that brain swap thing

20:37.663 --> 20:40.671
didn't happen to Bebop and I.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.176
Don't worry, dunce.

20:42.177 --> 20:45.184
You can't swap something
that's not there.

20:45.185 --> 20:47.691
Gee, that's a relief.

20:47.692 --> 20:48.761
I think.

20:51.703 --> 20:53.708
He's finally coming to.

20:53.709 --> 20:56.884
Yeah. Only, which he is he ?

20:56.885 --> 20:58.389
Thank you, my turtles.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.230
I've reverted to my true form.

21:01.231 --> 21:02.734
The transfer worked.

21:02.735 --> 21:04.239
What a relief.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.244
Way to go, Donatello.

21:06.245 --> 21:07.983
Hold on, fellas.

21:07.984 --> 21:10.891
How can we be sure this
is the real Splinter ?

21:10.892 --> 21:13.598
Only one way to find out, dudes.

21:13.599 --> 21:16.541
Care for some pizza, master ?

21:16.542 --> 21:20.117
Oh, please, take it away.

21:20.118 --> 21:23.059
With humongous pleasure.

21:25.533 --> 21:28.140
It's nice to have you
home again, sensei.

21:28.141 --> 21:30.848
It would be infinitely nicer for me

21:30.849 --> 21:32.152
if some effort would be made

21:32.153 --> 21:33.957
to see that the floors
are swept,

21:33.958 --> 21:36.698
the dust removed
from our humble furniture,

21:36.699 --> 21:39.037
And cleaning jobs
done all around.
