00:10.009 --> 00:14.347
- Time for one last call. Who's next?
- Elliott, on line three.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.142
Hello, Elliott. I'm listening.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.645
(Child's voice) 'I'm a salesman...'

00:21.812 --> 00:24.648
A salesman?! How old are you?

00:24.815 --> 00:27.610
- '43.'
- 43?

00:27.777 --> 00:31.489
- 'Yeah.'
- Let's be truthful.

00:31.655 --> 00:33.699
'I'm 43.'

00:34.617 --> 00:37.495
Elliott, we weren't born yesterday.

00:37.661 --> 00:41.707
You're an adolescent trying
to be clever by getting on air,

00:41.874 --> 00:45.377
but you're taking time
from people with real problems.

00:45.586 --> 00:50.007
'Hey, I'm 43. My problem is,
I have a young-sounding voice

00:50.174 --> 00:53.052
'that people make fun of all the time.'

00:56.555 --> 01:01.518
Oh, I...I'm so sorry, Elliott.
That was very insensitive of me.

01:01.685 --> 01:03.729
'Gotcha, Dr Dufus!'

01:11.028 --> 01:13.572
Indeed you did get us, Elliott.

01:13.739 --> 01:18.160
But we're not so stuffy
that we can't laugh at ourselves.

01:18.327 --> 01:21.914
Roz, keep these pimply-faced maggots
off the air!

01:22.998 --> 01:25.125
Well, that's our show for today.

01:25.292 --> 01:29.963
This is Dr Crane signing off
and wishing you good mental health.

01:33.091 --> 01:35.510
- Have a good weekend.
- Wait.

01:35.677 --> 01:39.222
I want an honest answer to a question.

01:39.389 --> 01:42.267
No, that outfit
does not make you look fat.

01:42.434 --> 01:45.353
That's not it. Why would you think so?

01:45.520 --> 01:49.024
Women usually begin that question with
"l want an honest answer".

01:49.191 --> 01:51.318
I'm not that insecure.

01:51.484 --> 01:54.237
Sorry. You're right. Your question?

01:54.404 --> 01:57.532
Is the back of my head unattractive?

01:59.868 --> 02:02.537
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm serious.

02:02.704 --> 02:05.123
You know I have season tickets
for the Seahawks?

02:05.290 --> 02:07.375
Well, this cute guy sits behind me.

02:07.542 --> 02:11.880
A few weeks ago, we said "hi",
but he hasn't asked me out.

02:12.047 --> 02:15.759
So I thought
the back of my head might be weird.

02:15.925 --> 02:19.637
There could be hundreds of reasons
he hasn't asked.

02:19.804 --> 02:22.098
That makes me feel better!

02:22.265 --> 02:25.435
Maybe he's married, maybe he's gay.

02:25.602 --> 02:29.731
Or maybe he's there to watch football
and not cruise chicks.

02:30.815 --> 02:33.318
You're right. I'm being ridiculous.

02:33.484 --> 02:35.820
- Of course. See you Monday.
- All right.

02:35.987 --> 02:38.031
I saw that! Wait!

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:48.458 --> 02:52.503
You're not getting the rest of my scone
so forget it.

02:55.965 --> 02:58.009
Mmm. It's really good.

03:00.052 --> 03:02.138
Mmm, yum, yum, yum.

03:03.723 --> 03:07.143
You can sit there
till you're blue in the face.

03:07.310 --> 03:10.646
As far as I'm concerned
you don't exist.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.945
Oh, all right! Here! Get fat!

03:20.698 --> 03:23.492
He got you again? You're a soft touch.

03:23.659 --> 03:26.162
- I am not.
- He never begs with me.

03:26.328 --> 03:31.125
- Maybe he doesn't like what you eat.
- He's not picky. He eats beetles.

03:32.293 --> 03:35.171
Eddie! Let's go for another walk.

03:35.337 --> 03:38.924
- I thought you walked him today.
- I did. Twice.

03:39.091 --> 03:41.427
- He's got to go again?
- No. I do.

03:43.012 --> 03:48.392
That didn't sound right.
There's a nice-looking man with a dog.

03:48.559 --> 03:50.978
We want to run into them again.

03:51.145 --> 03:53.939
Come on, Eddie.
He's playing hard to get.

03:54.106 --> 03:56.775
I'm glad somebody is.

03:58.610 --> 04:03.991
Will you fix the toilet? It's running.
The noise drives me crazy.

04:04.158 --> 04:07.703
- I'll call a plumber.
- You've got hands. Fix it yourself.

04:07.870 --> 04:09.413
(Doorbell rings)

04:09.580 --> 04:11.874
I am a doctor.

04:12.749 --> 04:16.211
I've more important things
to do than that.

04:17.337 --> 04:19.673
- Hello, Niles.
- Good news.

04:19.839 --> 04:23.343
We're having a salt glow
with our massage.

04:25.304 --> 04:30.434
Forget about the plumber. I'll do it.
My manicurist cancelled on me.

04:31.518 --> 04:35.022
- You will not.
- I bet you don't have any tools.

04:35.188 --> 04:37.899
You're wrong.
Let me show you something.

04:38.775 --> 04:42.738
See this? Every possible tool
for every possible need.

04:43.655 --> 04:45.699
I got it from Hammacher Schlemmer.

04:45.866 --> 04:51.079
- Is that turquoise inlay?
- Yes. It also comes in ebony and onyx.

04:51.246 --> 04:56.168
- Onyx is so showy.
- I love onyx. It resonates within me.

04:57.210 --> 05:00.255
This is why I never took
any home movies.

05:00.422 --> 05:04.509
Do you two realise
what delicate doilies you are?

05:05.844 --> 05:09.264
You don't know the meaning
of the word "self-reliant".

05:09.431 --> 05:12.309
Thank God
there's no disaster happening.

05:12.517 --> 05:15.937
- Oh, oh! A lemon zester.
- Yes.

05:20.316 --> 05:22.610
You know, Niles...

05:22.777 --> 05:27.073
I'd actually like to fix that toilet
just to prove Dad wrong.

05:28.116 --> 05:30.160
For the genetically superior,

05:30.326 --> 05:33.580
the last challenge of a toilet
should be how to use one.

05:33.746 --> 05:39.627
We've conquered the intellectual world
but with nuts and bolts, we need help.

05:39.794 --> 05:42.714
- You're serious?
- Yes. We'll fix it.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.466
Good experience, and it'll shut Dad up.

05:46.301 --> 05:49.345
- We'll show him we're tough.
- Exactly.

05:49.512 --> 05:52.557
We can let the eucalyptus wrap
be our reward.

05:59.397 --> 06:03.109
Maris, I'm afraid I'll be delayed
a few hours.

06:03.276 --> 06:06.571
Frasier and I are tackling
a home repair.

06:06.737 --> 06:09.240
Yes, I'm working with my hands.

06:10.575 --> 06:13.369
Yes, I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

06:14.787 --> 06:17.373
I suppose I could take my shirt off.

06:17.540 --> 06:22.169
- What are you doing?
- She's aroused by my manual labour.

06:23.713 --> 06:27.758
Maris,
I'm holding some sort of a wrench.

06:28.843 --> 06:31.053
Give me that!

06:31.220 --> 06:35.891
Hello, Maris. Niles is busy now.
Never mind what I'm wearing!

06:38.811 --> 06:41.063
- May we continue?
- Fine.

06:41.230 --> 06:45.609
Take the ball cock assembly,
thread it through the tank hole

06:45.776 --> 06:49.572
and fasten it under the tank
with a locknut.

06:49.738 --> 06:54.577
Yes, locknut. See Niles? Till today
you didn't know what a locknut was.

06:54.743 --> 06:57.746
That Niles is dead. Call me Dutch.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.918
Working with our hands like this,

07:03.085 --> 07:08.382
I'm reminded of that glorious tradition
of the Amish barn raising.

07:08.549 --> 07:13.429
All the men of the village
coming together, the mind, the muscle,

07:13.595 --> 07:18.267
all toward that one simple
yet extraordinary goal.

07:21.311 --> 07:24.690
All right. We are ready to flush.

07:29.111 --> 07:34.074
Here's to what we accomplish
when we put our minds to it. Flush away!

07:38.996 --> 07:43.959
It's working! Oh, my God! It's draining
out of the tank into the bowl.

07:44.126 --> 07:49.381
Filling the tank. I've seen it so often
but never has it meant so much.

07:49.548 --> 07:51.842
- Shouldn't it stop now?
- Yes.

07:52.008 --> 07:55.720
- It's overflowing.
- Oh, oh, oh! Oh, God!

07:55.887 --> 07:58.932
- What does it say to do now?
- Nothing.

07:59.099 --> 08:01.518
Where are your Amish friends now?

08:04.646 --> 08:11.069
The plumber's been called. The wine's
chilled. My world makes sense again.

08:12.904 --> 08:14.948
We've had a tough day.

08:15.115 --> 08:18.451
We've tangled with
a little pipe and porcelain.

08:18.618 --> 08:21.246
Now it's Montrachet time.

08:29.212 --> 08:32.048
We made a mistake in trying to fix it.

08:32.215 --> 08:36.052
Yes. We tampered with
the natural order of things.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.431
But now, order has been restored.

08:40.597 --> 08:45.395
By hiring a plumber, that plumber
can buy, say, a Dolly Parton album.

08:47.897 --> 08:52.068
Miss Parton finances a tour,
allowing a local promoter

08:52.235 --> 08:57.824
to afford to send his cross-dressing
son to us for $150-an-hour therapy.

09:03.121 --> 09:05.164
To the circle of life!

09:06.082 --> 09:07.500
(Doorbell)

09:07.667 --> 09:09.669
Must be the plumber.

09:09.836 --> 09:13.422
Are you answering it
or hiring someone to?

09:13.589 --> 09:15.591
Dad, we tried, OK?

09:15.758 --> 09:16.759
(Doorbell)

09:16.926 --> 09:20.638
Oh, please, I wasn't doing anything.
Let me get it.

09:22.515 --> 09:25.226
- Somebody call a plumber?
- Not soon enough.

09:25.393 --> 09:27.478
Follow me.

09:27.645 --> 09:32.650
- Nice way to spend an afternoon!
- We're psychiatrists, not plumbers.

09:32.817 --> 09:35.903
Some heads you shouldn't tamper with.

09:43.536 --> 09:46.997
- You've got to get him out of here.
- What?

09:47.164 --> 09:50.709
That man is not fit to touch your toilet.

09:50.876 --> 09:54.421
Niles, have you been
self-medicating again?

09:56.757 --> 10:01.011
- That was Danny Kriezel.
- Kriezel the weasel?

10:01.178 --> 10:03.973
How can you be sure?
It's been 25 years.

10:04.139 --> 10:07.726
I'd know him anywhere.
He bullied me all my childhood.

10:09.144 --> 10:11.522
He didn't recognise you.

10:11.689 --> 10:14.942
Because he wasn't
flushing my head in a toilet.

10:15.859 --> 10:19.029
That was his trademark.
He called it a swirly.

10:20.739 --> 10:23.617
I remember the Kriezel reign of terror.

10:23.784 --> 10:26.829
I can trace my fear of confined spaces

10:26.995 --> 10:31.583
back to when his older brother, Billy,
shoved me into a locker

10:31.750 --> 10:35.379
for wearing a girl's field hockey uniform.

10:36.755 --> 10:40.676
- I didn't mean to deny you your pain.
- Thank you.

10:40.842 --> 10:45.806
I can hear Kriezel's mocking voice
as he hoisted me over the bowl.

10:45.973 --> 10:48.350
"Hold your breath, jocko."

10:49.393 --> 10:52.062
The crowd would start its awful chant.

10:52.229 --> 10:55.816
"There goes Crane, down the drain.
There goes Crane..."

10:55.982 --> 10:58.610
Niles, stop! Niles! Niles!

10:58.777 --> 11:01.446
Get a hold of yourself! Stop it!

11:05.033 --> 11:08.620
You're a renowned psychiatrist now.

11:08.787 --> 11:13.917
Kriezel won the battle in junior high,
but that's where he peaked.

11:14.084 --> 11:17.170
You won the war.
You know the expression:

11:17.337 --> 11:20.882
- "Living well is the best revenge."
- Wonderful.

11:21.049 --> 11:23.802
I just don't know how true it is.

11:23.969 --> 11:27.972
You don't see it turning up
in a lot of opera plots.

11:30.266 --> 11:32.894
Ludwig, maddened
by the poisoning of his family,

11:33.061 --> 11:36.439
wreaks vengeance in the third act
by living well.

11:37.649 --> 11:39.692
All right, Niles.

11:39.859 --> 11:44.113
Then Wotan wreaks vengeance
by living even better than the Duke.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.574
Oh, all right!

11:50.453 --> 11:53.790
- That's a new part, right?
- Yeah.

11:53.957 --> 11:57.335
I'm sure you're charging me
for a new part

11:57.502 --> 12:00.380
so I wouldn't want a used part.

12:00.546 --> 12:03.299
What are you, the plumbing police?

12:04.676 --> 12:06.719
I'll be back.

12:16.521 --> 12:21.400
Don't mind me. I came for an aspirin.
Tannic acid gives me a headache.

12:21.567 --> 12:26.113
But that's the price I pay
for drinking expensive wine.

12:30.534 --> 12:32.954
- Hey.
- Yes?

12:33.120 --> 12:38.334
You've got a real mess here.
My partner will have to bring new parts.

12:38.501 --> 12:42.963
- That's two guys on golden time. OK?
- It's only money.

12:44.340 --> 12:48.052
Say, has somebody been trying
to fix this thing?

12:48.219 --> 12:50.346
Not me.

12:50.513 --> 12:54.183
I don't even set the clock
in my Mercedes E320.

12:56.185 --> 13:01.106
- Boy! That's a nice car.
- Yes. I should say it is.

13:01.673 --> 13:03.884
I had one for a while.

13:04.051 --> 13:08.889
But it was too small for the family
so we upgraded to the S-class.

13:09.806 --> 13:12.184
You have the big Mercedes?

13:13.101 --> 13:18.523
Yeah, and I've got to tell you, my
13-year-old's already got his eye on it.

13:18.690 --> 13:23.111
He's a great kid.
Except he got in a fight the other day.

13:23.278 --> 13:28.492
Really? Some small-boned child
with superior language skills?

13:28.658 --> 13:30.493
No!

13:34.122 --> 13:37.334
A big jerk who tried
to steal his lunch money.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.171
Oh.
Well, there's nothing like a bully.

13:41.338 --> 13:45.884
I've got to tell you,
I'd rather he'd be a bully

13:46.051 --> 13:50.013
than a wussy kid that gets picked on,
you know the kind?

13:50.180 --> 13:55.727
- Kids too gutless to fight back.
- You admire those who fight back?

13:55.894 --> 13:58.062
Well, sure. I mean...

13:59.272 --> 14:04.068
lf you don't fight back, what are you?
You're a wuss, a wimp.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.322
- You're a...
- Stop!

14:07.488 --> 14:10.825
Niles! Leave the man alone.
He's trying to work.

14:21.252 --> 14:23.796
What's Dr Crane doing?

14:23.963 --> 14:28.342
He's frustrated because
I wouldn't let him do something.

14:28.509 --> 14:31.262
He's taking his anger out
on my ficus.

14:32.221 --> 14:35.683
I've never seen him so angry.
He's like a madman.

14:38.436 --> 14:42.815
Good Lord! There's a bee out there
the size of a wood finch.

14:45.568 --> 14:47.778
Are you ready to talk now?

14:47.945 --> 14:50.031
No. I'm not ready yet.

14:55.328 --> 14:59.874
Niles, I have to be honest.
I'm a little disappointed in you.

15:00.041 --> 15:05.046
Were you actually going to stick
someone's head into a toilet?

15:05.212 --> 15:07.465
You don't seem to understand.

15:07.631 --> 15:10.634
This beast
has been awakened within me.

15:10.801 --> 15:13.012
Can you get that for me?

15:15.389 --> 15:19.268
Niles, there is a beast in all of us.

15:19.435 --> 15:23.189
Part of becoming an adult
is learning to control it.

15:23.355 --> 15:26.025
That separates us from the Kriezels.

15:26.191 --> 15:30.654
Also their tendency to squat down
and groom each other.

15:30.821 --> 15:35.826
You have an opportunity with Danny
I've never had with Billy.

15:35.993 --> 15:40.205
To confront him as a rational adult
and achieve closure.

15:40.372 --> 15:44.668
Easier said than done.
One look at that oafish face,

15:44.835 --> 15:49.840
those dead Kriezel eyes, you see
there's no chance for communication.

15:50.007 --> 15:52.676
There is, Niles. There has to be.

15:52.843 --> 15:57.014
I can't go in. lf he turns his back
on me, I'll attack him.

15:57.181 --> 16:00.267
No, you won't.
You're not a child any more.

16:00.434 --> 16:03.770
Come with me.
I'm taking you to the bathroom.

16:09.610 --> 16:12.237
Excuse me, sir.

16:12.404 --> 16:16.658
- I'd like to have a word with you.
- Yeah. Go ahead.

16:16.825 --> 16:20.412
I'd like to take you back in time
to the 1970s.

16:20.579 --> 16:24.124
There was a gifted student
at John Adams Junior High.

16:25.167 --> 16:28.003
You terrorised that student

16:28.170 --> 16:31.173
simply because he was different
from you.

16:31.339 --> 16:33.508
- It was I.
- No kidding?

16:33.675 --> 16:38.430
Could we step into the living room
and reach an understanding?

16:38.597 --> 16:43.351
It's OK with me. Any room
in the house is still $59 an hour.

16:46.521 --> 16:48.982
I'll be right back, Billy.

16:57.157 --> 16:59.034
Billy?

16:59.200 --> 17:03.037
That's my brother for you.
Always getting into stuff.

17:03.204 --> 17:07.584
But your friend's getting
all worked up over nothing.

17:07.750 --> 17:12.046
- You think so, Billy?
- Kids pick on other kids.

17:12.213 --> 17:16.134
- It made those weak kids tougher.
- Really?

17:16.300 --> 17:21.138
You're a big guy.
You must have been involved in stuff.

17:21.306 --> 17:24.058
Oh, I was involved.

17:27.979 --> 17:31.733
Billy, I'd like to take you back in time.

17:31.899 --> 17:35.319
No. Let me take you back.

17:35.486 --> 17:39.741
I remember once, we jammed
this poindexter into a locker

17:39.907 --> 17:42.535
wearing a girl's hockey uniform.

17:46.455 --> 17:50.376
No, I'm sorry.
I just don't remember you.

17:50.543 --> 17:53.588
Perhaps you'll remember
third period gym class?

17:53.754 --> 17:56.841
You made me wear my jockstrap
like a tiara.

17:58.384 --> 18:01.220
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

18:01.387 --> 18:06.809
Were you the kid who used to carry
his gym shorts in an attaché case?

18:12.898 --> 18:15.359
It was a valise.

18:16.485 --> 18:21.073
I remember you.
Boy, those were some crazy times.

18:21.240 --> 18:26.078
- Do you ever see any of the old gang?
- You're missing the point.

18:27.079 --> 18:30.165
I was severely scarred
by those experiences.

18:30.332 --> 18:34.962
Wait. I can't defend everything
I did in junior high. Who can?

18:35.129 --> 18:40.301
But let's face it: you show up wearing
a tweed blazer with elbow patches,

18:40.467 --> 18:45.472
and carrying a valise,
I mean, I think the guilt here is 50-50.

18:48.976 --> 18:52.479
He's yelling about repressed tendencies

18:52.646 --> 18:57.443
so we stuffed a fire extinguisher
down his pants. We called it...

18:57.609 --> 19:00.112
- A jet pack.
- That's it!

19:01.405 --> 19:03.866
Man, you remember them all.

19:04.032 --> 19:08.370
My next question is
why did you behave this way?

19:09.538 --> 19:14.334
I don't know. I mean, I guess
because people thought it was funny.

19:14.501 --> 19:18.922
I see. So, to get this validation,
you would, say,

19:19.089 --> 19:23.427
squeeze my head between your ankles
and hop around the lunchroom?

19:25.012 --> 19:27.764
- I did that to you?
- Yes.

19:27.931 --> 19:30.642
How does that make you feel?

19:31.726 --> 19:33.770
Well, kind of bad.

19:36.106 --> 19:38.525
The healing has begun.

19:39.693 --> 19:42.445
On the bus, we pantsed him.

19:42.612 --> 19:45.907
He's yelling,
"Give me back my pants!"

19:46.074 --> 19:49.327
But, whoops! They fell out the window.

19:50.745 --> 19:55.959
So the aggressive acts were misplaced
outbursts aimed at your father.

19:56.126 --> 19:58.169
Yes.

19:59.629 --> 20:01.965
He was the real bully, wasn't he?

20:02.132 --> 20:06.511
- Oh, yes.
- Let it out, Danny.

20:06.678 --> 20:09.973
Nothing I ever did
was good enough for him.

20:10.140 --> 20:13.518
I am so sorry
that I picked on you, man.

20:14.936 --> 20:19.732
I just wanted to be good at something
and I was good at that.

20:21.901 --> 20:24.070
You were the best.

20:24.237 --> 20:29.325
Then we made him dance the hula
in his underwear in front of the girls.

20:31.869 --> 20:36.040
- You should have been there.
- I was there!

20:36.207 --> 20:41.587
- Thanks. This has just been terrific.
- I can't take all the credit.

20:41.754 --> 20:46.592
My brother convinced me a civilised
person can work anything out

20:46.759 --> 20:49.512
as long as he's calm and rational.

20:49.679 --> 20:52.890
Run, Niles, run! The beast is loose!

21:02.525 --> 21:07.488
- You really shoved his head in here?
- I don't know. It's all a blur.

21:07.655 --> 21:09.740
I guess I just lost control.

21:09.907 --> 21:13.411
- I bet it felt good, though, didn't it?
- No.

21:13.577 --> 21:15.830
It felt damned good!

21:17.123 --> 21:21.877
Pity you didn't do it 20 years ago.
You'd have given him a better swirly.

21:22.044 --> 21:27.091
These low-flow toilets don't have
the same velocity as the old ones.

21:28.008 --> 21:31.095
- What did he do to you?
- Not a thing.

21:31.262 --> 21:36.225
- You paid him off?
- I've never written a cheque so fast.

21:37.434 --> 21:39.270
Well...

21:40.104 --> 21:42.481
There she goes. Good as new.

21:42.648 --> 21:46.485
- Thanks. Can I buy you a beer?
- Yeah, sounds good.

21:49.947 --> 21:51.990
Come on, Eddie.

21:53.992 --> 21:57.704
Oh, for God's sake, Eddie,
don't drink out of the toilet.

21:57.871 --> 22:00.582
Some guy
just had his head in there.

22:05.712 --> 22:10.676
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.843 --> 22:12.719
# Mercy!

22:12.886 --> 22:19.643
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:19.810 --> 22:26.650
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.817 --> 22:28.985
# They're calling again

22:29.152 --> 22:32.155
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:32.322 --> 22:36.284
# What is a boy to do? #

22:36.451 --> 22:39.955
Good night, Seattle, we love you!

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
