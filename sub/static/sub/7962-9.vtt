WEBVTT

00:03.980 --> 00:06.480
CHARLIE:<i> First of all,</i>
<i>I'd like to say I-I personally</i>

00:06.482 --> 00:07.648
didn't think any of us
would be standing

00:07.650 --> 00:08.716
in front of you
here today.

00:08.718 --> 00:10.251
No, no, I mean...
Shit, no.

00:10.253 --> 00:11.552
I thought we were
going straight to hell.
Yeah.

00:11.554 --> 00:13.421
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Right, well...

00:13.423 --> 00:15.890
But that being said--
I mean, we're good people.
Oh, yeah.

00:15.892 --> 00:17.725
I did what I did.
You don't like it,

00:17.727 --> 00:19.427
you can kiss my ass.
Oh, oh.

00:19.429 --> 00:21.395
Easy, easy.
Hey, could we be judged
individually?

00:21.397 --> 00:23.264
'Cause I don't want
to be lumped in with him.

00:23.266 --> 00:24.732
Look, I know
you're gonna judge us.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.901
But before that
cruise ship went down,

00:26.903 --> 00:28.669
we prayed. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yes. Yeah.

00:28.671 --> 00:30.938
I mean, like, sure, we've
done some bad things,

00:30.940 --> 00:33.274
you know, but-but we've
changed, I promise.

00:33.276 --> 00:34.842
I'm gonna
walk you through how.
Mm-hmm.

00:34.844 --> 00:37.244
So please just reserve
your judgment, okay?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.746
Because once we're finished,

00:38.748 --> 00:40.748
I'm sure you will
judge us accordingly.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.683
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles softly)

01:07.543 --> 01:09.810
Goddamn, this ship
is the tits!

01:09.812 --> 01:11.312
Frank, Frank, watch
your language. You know?

01:11.314 --> 01:13.114
This is a Christian
cruise.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.649
Yeah, and I got to say, winning
raffles, going on cruises--

01:15.651 --> 01:17.318
I like this new church
of yours, Mac.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.986
I think you found
the right one.
Yeah.

01:18.988 --> 01:21.789
Oh, I didn't find
them. They found me.
Ah.

01:21.791 --> 01:23.891
And it's all, of course,
a part of God's plan.

01:23.893 --> 01:25.493
It's also a part
of God's plan

01:25.495 --> 01:27.795
that we all get closer
to him through fellowship.

01:27.797 --> 01:29.130
Hey, Mac, is God
gonna be able to protect

01:29.132 --> 01:30.798
against the ship sinking?

01:30.800 --> 01:33.968
God protects all things,
Charlie. He is an awesome god.

01:33.970 --> 01:37.505
The only way this ship is gonna
sink is if the captain's drunk.

01:37.507 --> 01:39.573
Guys, we don't have to worry
about drunk captains,

01:39.575 --> 01:41.008
'cause this is the
dry cruise, remember?

01:41.010 --> 01:43.077
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
And about that, um,

01:43.079 --> 01:45.746
where exactly does God stand
on that dry thing?

01:45.748 --> 01:48.315
Is that a hard, fast rule or
is there some wiggle room?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.684
Look, this cruise is an
opportunity for us to get away

01:50.686 --> 01:52.987
from the sins of everyday life.
That being said,

01:52.989 --> 01:55.923
we will each have to have a half
a cap of mouthwash every day.

01:55.925 --> 01:58.025
You know, just to stave off
the shakes.

01:58.027 --> 02:00.161
Smart, smart.
Don't want to get sick.
Yeah.
Oh, thank God.

02:00.163 --> 02:03.430
Okay, guys, I am gonna head up
to Bible study right now.
Oh.

02:03.432 --> 02:05.666
Oh, right now.
Uh, this is our suite. Yeah, you
guys can check in or whatever.

02:05.668 --> 02:07.001
But the... Do you want
to meet me there?

02:07.003 --> 02:08.202
Do we?
Yeah, yeah,

02:08.204 --> 02:09.503
we'll, we'll...
We got to...

02:09.505 --> 02:10.604
set our bags down
and then, uh...

02:10.606 --> 02:12.106
Yeah, we... I have to
unpack, I always do.

02:12.108 --> 02:13.440
All right. Peace
be with you.

02:13.442 --> 02:14.775
All right.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

02:14.777 --> 02:16.277
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

02:16.279 --> 02:18.212
You're supposed to say,
"And also with you."

02:18.214 --> 02:20.114
Why is that?
Would you say...

02:20.116 --> 02:21.515
I'm not gonna say that.
Uh, you know what,
I'll say it,

02:21.517 --> 02:23.217
if it's gonna help you
get out of here

02:23.219 --> 02:25.052
and go to your Bible study.
But I'm not gonna mean it.

02:25.054 --> 02:26.120
Oh, you don't have to mean it.

02:26.122 --> 02:27.188
Yeah, you just have to say it.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.722
Okay. And also with you. Bye.

02:28.724 --> 02:30.691
Guys, this is gonna be
the best cruise ever.
And also with you.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.226
Yeah.
I'm not saying it.

02:32.228 --> 02:33.861
Take care.
I'm not saying that.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.129
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh.
You don't have to mean it.

02:35.131 --> 02:38.699
Mmm.
Yeah.

02:38.701 --> 02:41.869
Oh, shit.
(rumbling growl)

02:41.871 --> 02:43.370
Yeah.
I needed that.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.372
Man, and the beer calms
my nerves, too, you know

02:45.374 --> 02:47.208
what I mean? I feel like I could
drink that whole suitcase.
Oh, God,

02:47.210 --> 02:48.909
me, too. But let's not, okay?

02:48.911 --> 02:50.544
'Cause this is the only
alcohol on the entire ship.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.246
Ooh, yeah.
Yeah. All right, okay.

02:52.248 --> 02:54.081
That'd be bad.
But it's time to suit up now,

02:54.083 --> 02:55.983
so we can get
into some nonsense.
What do mean, suit up?

02:55.985 --> 02:56.984
Did you bring costumes?

02:56.986 --> 02:58.085
Yeah. Yeah.

02:58.087 --> 02:59.386
I'm gonna be the captain.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.821
Charlie's gonna
be the first mate.

03:00.823 --> 03:01.889
No, no, no, I-I'm putting

03:01.891 --> 03:02.923
a stop to this right now.

03:02.925 --> 03:04.558
No costumes, no high jinks.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.260
Okay? Can we just... Guys,
can we take a vacation

03:06.262 --> 03:07.928
from our usual bullshit?

03:07.930 --> 03:09.597
You know, I'm not saying
we got to do the God stuff,

03:09.599 --> 03:10.731
but let's not--
let's not do a bunch

03:10.733 --> 03:12.733
of anti-God stuff either, okay?

03:12.735 --> 03:14.235
So don't be gluttonous.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.103
Okay? You--
no wrath.

03:16.105 --> 03:19.073
No lust for me. You know,
which is gonna be difficult,

03:19.075 --> 03:20.908
given the implications
of being on a boat.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.610
All right, well, I'm taking
a vacation from you guys, okay?

03:22.612 --> 03:24.745
I'm tired
of getting shit on.
All right.

03:24.747 --> 03:26.080
That's what I'm talking about,
Dee. Nobody's gonna shit on you.

03:26.082 --> 03:28.082
Nobody's gonna call you a bird.

03:28.084 --> 03:30.751
I agree. But first,
I got to take the cross off
Oh, yeah.

03:30.753 --> 03:34.521
that Mac gave us. This thing
is burning me to shit.
Yeah, yeah.

03:34.523 --> 03:35.589
There. Look at that.
Oh!
DENNIS: Oh.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.024
DEE:
Oh! Goddamn, Frank.

03:37.026 --> 03:38.192
Oh, my God.

03:38.194 --> 03:39.593
You might actually
be the devil.

03:39.595 --> 03:40.594
Jesus, I'm gonna
take mine off, too.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.763
I could be Satan.
(laughs)

03:42.765 --> 03:43.931
Screw God!

03:43.933 --> 03:46.467
(thunderous horn blows)

03:46.469 --> 03:49.436
Whoa, whoa, what-what was that?
Did-did God do that?

03:49.438 --> 03:52.106
No, no, no.
Don't go crazy on the
God stuff, all right?

03:52.108 --> 03:54.942
That being said, the timing
of that big boat noise was...

03:54.944 --> 03:57.444
pretty suspect, so, Frank,
maybe don't push his buttons?

03:57.446 --> 03:58.612
Yeah.
I get that.
Yeah.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.680
All right, I'll leave him alone.

04:00.883 --> 04:02.383
Hey, Mac.

04:02.385 --> 04:05.052
We are about ready to get
started. You feeling okay?

04:05.054 --> 04:06.487
Yeah, David. It's good.
I-I just, uh,

04:06.489 --> 04:08.489
was waiting on my friends.

04:08.491 --> 04:12.226
They said they were gonna be
here and they're not here yet.

04:12.228 --> 04:14.795
I should have taken on
a missionary position with them.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.497
You know?
They need salvation.

04:16.499 --> 04:17.965
Especially my one
friend, Frank.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.967
I even started putting
battery acid on the back

04:19.969 --> 04:22.136
of his cross necklace
to burn through his skin.

04:22.138 --> 04:23.404
Why?

04:23.406 --> 04:24.672
Oh, to subtly send the message

04:24.674 --> 04:25.806
that he might be a demon.

04:25.808 --> 04:29.176
Oh, well, yikes.

04:29.178 --> 04:31.745
Uh, listen, when your friends
are ready, they'll come.

04:31.747 --> 04:33.747
Right, yeah. You know, we
should just get started.

04:33.749 --> 04:35.182
Scott, you ready to go?
Yup, yup.
All right,

04:35.184 --> 04:36.483
everybody, why don't
we gather around.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.685
Why don't we, uh...

04:37.687 --> 04:38.986
Well, let's just...

04:38.988 --> 04:40.187
We'll sing through it once

04:40.189 --> 04:41.689
and we'll get it on its feet.

04:41.691 --> 04:43.691
(upbeat tune playing)

04:43.693 --> 04:46.093
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

04:46.095 --> 04:47.494
guys...
what's that song?

04:47.496 --> 04:49.330
I-I'm not familiar
with that hymn.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.864
Uh, the song's "Sit Down,
You're Rockin' the Boat"

04:50.866 --> 04:52.766
from<i> Guys and Dolls.</i>

04:52.768 --> 04:54.034
It's for the talent show.
We do it every year

04:54.036 --> 04:55.836
on this cruise.
It's fun.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.672
Fun? No, no, the songs
aren't supposed to be fun,

04:58.674 --> 05:00.841
they're supposed to
be bleak and dreary,

05:00.843 --> 05:02.776
so we can focus on
how bad we are.

05:02.778 --> 05:05.179
Yeah. We need to
punish our ears

05:05.181 --> 05:07.548
to pay for the original
sin of being born.

05:07.550 --> 05:09.616
Mac, look, uh, I know
it can be difficult

05:09.618 --> 05:11.218
transitioning into a new church.

05:11.220 --> 05:13.787
All we ask is that
you try to keep an open mind.

05:13.789 --> 05:15.789
Okay, I... Maybe
I can do that.

05:15.791 --> 05:18.192
I... But, guys, I can
almost guarantee you

05:18.194 --> 05:20.894
that I'm not gonna like this.

05:20.896 --> 05:22.629
♪ Said to myself sit down ♪

05:22.631 --> 05:24.631
♪ Sit down,
you're rockin' the boat ♪

05:35.978 --> 05:37.044
Yes!

05:37.046 --> 05:40.047
Yes! Yes!

05:40.049 --> 05:43.050
I feel like I've been waiting
for this my entire life.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.885
Good.
We're glad you had fun.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.553
Yes, yeah.
I'm ready to go again.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.888
Well, you've already gone twice.
We're sort of

05:47.890 --> 05:49.223
taking turns...
We're gonna go

05:49.225 --> 05:51.392
from the top. Five,
six, seven, eight...

05:51.394 --> 05:53.494
These winter coats
were a good idea-- it is chilly.
Yeah.

05:53.496 --> 05:54.895
Come in handy.
You don't want...

05:54.897 --> 05:56.397
They're cranking
the air conditioning.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.564
Yeah, you don't
want to be sick on a boat.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.900
Whoa, look at this place.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.435
I think we died
and went to heaven, Frank.

06:01.437 --> 06:03.404
Oh. Dude.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.938
I thought you said they
didn't have alcohol.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.240
Look, they-they
got screwdrivers.

06:06.242 --> 06:07.441
Oh, no, Charlie.

06:07.443 --> 06:09.343
That's just orange juice.

06:09.345 --> 06:10.911
There's no alcohol.
Just orange juice,
like the mixer?

06:10.913 --> 06:12.746
Yeah.
Yeah, people drink it.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.348
People drink it. Yeah.
That's crazy to me.

06:14.350 --> 06:16.417
When was the last time
you drank straight mixer?

06:16.419 --> 06:18.419
Oh, I had a diet cola mixer
a while ago.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.520
Oh, did you?
(burps)

06:19.522 --> 06:20.687
Was it any good?

06:20.689 --> 06:22.689
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Whoa. (sniffs)

06:22.691 --> 06:24.291
What?
Dude.

06:24.293 --> 06:25.959
You drinking a beer
right now?

06:25.961 --> 06:28.595
What? Get out of town.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.264
You can lie, but that burp
told me the whole story.

06:30.266 --> 06:31.532
You holding?
What you got?

06:31.534 --> 06:33.100
You smell the beer?
You holding beer?

06:33.102 --> 06:34.535
Come on, man.

06:34.537 --> 06:35.803
Bingo!
(laughs)

06:35.805 --> 06:37.104
MAN:
Excuse me.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.939
You can't have alcohol
on the ship.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.107
Oh, this, uh,
this is an empty.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.875
That-that was
an empty can.

06:41.877 --> 06:43.444
A pelican dropped
it and we...
Yeah, we picked it up.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.478
Yeah, it was, like...
Do you have

06:44.480 --> 06:45.479
any more on you, sir?

06:45.481 --> 06:47.147
No, not a bit.
Yeah.

06:47.149 --> 06:49.483
What's going on here?
Uh, uh, Captain.

06:49.485 --> 06:50.984
Do you have any more
alcohol on you?

06:50.986 --> 06:52.152
Uh, not a bit.

06:52.154 --> 06:54.655
If you'll excuse me. Yup.

06:54.657 --> 06:56.223
Whoa!

06:56.225 --> 06:57.724
What the hell
is that, Frank?

06:57.726 --> 06:59.293
Well, I don't want
to run back and forth

06:59.295 --> 07:01.061
to the cabin all the time,
it's so far away.

07:01.063 --> 07:02.463
Son of a bitch!

07:02.465 --> 07:04.331
And you--
you have any beer on you?

07:04.333 --> 07:06.633
Aah!

07:06.635 --> 07:08.001
Charlie, you lied to me.

07:08.003 --> 07:09.670
Uh, well, you
lied first, man!

07:09.672 --> 07:11.672
Is that the rest of it?
Yeah, that's
all of it.

07:11.674 --> 07:13.507
We have to confiscate
all these beers from you.
Okay.

07:13.509 --> 07:14.875
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, got it.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.318
DEE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.686
That's my seat, bitch.

07:25.688 --> 07:27.154
Excuse me.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.922
Sorry. Got a little worked up.

07:28.924 --> 07:30.691
Uh, not quite
in vacation mode yet.

07:30.693 --> 07:32.092
Let me try again.

07:32.094 --> 07:34.828
Um, please get your shit
off my seat.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.164
I don't see your magazine
or towel on it,

07:37.166 --> 07:38.999
and I got here first,

07:39.001 --> 07:42.736
so I don't feel like
it's really your seat.

07:49.044 --> 07:51.178
I'm sitting with you.
Thought you were taking
a vacation from us.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.347
Yeah, I was trying,
but this is the only seat open,

07:53.349 --> 07:54.715
so can you try not
to shit on me

07:54.717 --> 07:56.116
for, like, the next hour
or so, please?

07:56.118 --> 07:57.518
I'm trying to relax.
Dee, relax.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.052
I'm not gonna shit on you.

07:59.054 --> 08:00.854
Okay? Nobody's
shitting on you.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.689
How's it going
with the wrath thing?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.291
You, uh, staying
away from that?

08:04.293 --> 08:05.692
Well, yeah, you know,
I was trying,

08:05.694 --> 08:07.127
but there are certain
"see you next Tuesdays"

08:07.129 --> 08:09.029
on this ship that are making it
very difficult.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.531
Well, yeah, I
feel you. I'm...

08:10.533 --> 08:12.132
I'm already struggling
with the lust thing.

08:12.134 --> 08:15.035
See this, uh,
flaxen-haired seductress

08:15.037 --> 08:16.537
across the pool over here?

08:16.539 --> 08:18.572
Dennis, she looks like
she's 12 years old.

08:18.574 --> 08:20.574
No, she's of age.
I checked.

08:20.576 --> 08:23.544
Well, she's gallivanting
around, you know,

08:23.546 --> 08:25.145
flaunting it for me,
and she knows how easy

08:25.147 --> 08:26.747
it would be for me
to have her, too,

08:26.749 --> 08:28.215
because of the
implication.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.650
Not that you
would understand.

08:29.652 --> 08:31.418
It's not what
you think it is.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.220
No, I think I get it. We're out
in the middle of the ocean.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.055
She's stuck on a boat.
She couldn't possibly say no,

08:35.057 --> 08:38.058
'cause something might go wrong
for her if she did.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.660
That's... that's
exactly what it is.

08:39.662 --> 08:41.395
How did you get
that so fast?

08:41.397 --> 08:44.731
It's like
when I'm alone with a guy,

08:44.733 --> 08:47.734
and we're messing around, and he
gets all skittish about banging.

08:47.736 --> 08:51.238
So then I insinuate
that it would be a shame

08:51.240 --> 08:54.074
if my account of what happened
was different from his

08:54.076 --> 08:55.943
and then he ended up getting
a call from the sheriff.

08:55.945 --> 08:57.578
You know what I mean?

08:57.580 --> 09:00.180
And then, boom. We plow.

09:00.182 --> 09:03.450
Okay. Yeah. No,
I-I think I get it.

09:03.452 --> 09:05.352
Yeah, right?
Right, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

09:05.354 --> 09:06.753
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

09:06.755 --> 09:08.855
Oh, a bird shit on me!
Oh.

09:08.857 --> 09:09.923
A bird shit in my mouth!

09:09.925 --> 09:11.425
A bird shit inside
of my mouth!

09:11.427 --> 09:12.859
(muttering gibberish)

09:12.861 --> 09:14.261
I'm literally getting shit on.

09:14.263 --> 09:15.929
I'm literally
getting shit on!

09:15.931 --> 09:18.532
Hit it! Hit it!
Hit it!
Whoa!

09:18.534 --> 09:21.201
Oh, yeah!
Hey.

09:21.203 --> 09:23.103
Hey, fellowship
was fun.
Yeah, see?

09:23.105 --> 09:25.372
It doesn't have to be all dour
and penitent to praise God.

09:25.374 --> 09:27.040
Is it my turn?
Absolutely.
Step up.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.475
Okay.

09:28.477 --> 09:31.111
Aah! No!

09:31.113 --> 09:33.146
I failed!
It's okay.

09:33.148 --> 09:34.615
I failed.
I failed you.
Nah.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.116
No.
I failed God.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.152
All right, get me good.
Whoa.

09:39.154 --> 09:40.621
Hello.
What is...?

09:40.623 --> 09:42.289
I brought
my cat-o'-nine-tails.
Yeah.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.790
You know, so, flagellate me.
Three-three lashes for missing.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.560
Why would you want me
to do that?

09:46.562 --> 09:48.629
So I could be
a better boy.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.464
Mac, it isn't a sin to miss,
okay? That's...

09:50.466 --> 09:52.065
We don't punish ourselves
for that.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.734
You don't punish yourselves?

09:53.736 --> 09:55.802
Then how do you become
closer to God?

09:55.804 --> 09:59.673
By just appreciating the game
and the wonderful day.

09:59.675 --> 10:01.475
Well, sure, yeah,
it's a wonderful day now,

10:01.477 --> 10:03.143
but look at that storm coming.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.811
(thunderclap)
That's impending doom
right there.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.681
He-he probably sent that storm
because I keep failing him.

10:07.683 --> 10:10.183
Look, just relax, try it again,

10:10.185 --> 10:12.819
and this time, hey, no guilt.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.821
No guilt?

10:14.823 --> 10:16.723
Okay.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.159
Oh, my.
Yes!

10:19.161 --> 10:20.994
I did it! I did it!
All right.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.663
In your face!
I beat your asses.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.098
(thunder rumbles)
Whoa. Gay. Gay.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.500
Gay, gay, gay, gay.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.201
What are you doing?
Why are you two kissing?

10:28.203 --> 10:31.171
Uh, because he's my husband,
and we love each other.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.773
What's going on?

10:32.775 --> 10:34.341
What-what about God?
You-you heard him.

10:34.343 --> 10:38.011
He clapped and said, "No! Boom!"

10:38.013 --> 10:41.014
You think thunder
is God clapping?

10:41.016 --> 10:42.549
Oh, no.

10:42.551 --> 10:45.118
Oh, no.
(thunder rumbling)

10:50.693 --> 10:53.060
FRANK:
You think there's gonna be
anybody here with talent?

10:53.062 --> 10:54.528
I mean,
this is a Christian cruise.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.029
This is gonna be boring as shit.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.198
I'm anticipating
a boring show.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.566
Yeah, yeah.

10:59.568 --> 11:01.034
Oh, there she is.
Hmm.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.736
Sitting by me
again, huh?
Shut up.

11:02.738 --> 11:04.705
I need something to wash the
bird shit taste out of my mouth.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.406
Oh, yeah.
I saw you guys.
Where are the beers?

11:06.408 --> 11:07.908
In the captain's stomach.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.309
Yeah.
CHARLIE:
Yeah, it's, uh...

11:09.311 --> 11:10.544
We kind of got, like,

11:10.546 --> 11:11.878
you know, caught with them.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.913
All of them?

11:12.915 --> 11:14.381
Yup.
Pretty much, yeah.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.383
I knew you couldn't stop
from being gluttonous.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.884
Oh, you guys.
Uh, all right, fine...
It was a mistake, man.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.220
Give me the mouthwash.
I need the mouthwash then.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.055
That's gone, too.
I kind of drank...
all of it.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.890
Charlie drank it.
He needed to calm down.
You serious?

11:23.892 --> 11:26.093
Goddamn it!
(thunder rumbles)

11:26.095 --> 11:27.594
It doesn't do... Oh.
(electrical buzzing)

11:27.596 --> 11:29.062
Whoa. Whoa. See. Oh!

11:29.064 --> 11:30.931
See, I don't like
the storm, man.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.399
The storm's starting to freak
me out. You know what I mean?

11:32.401 --> 11:34.568
Yeah, WTF?
Yes, yes, the storm
is intensifying.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.903
And yet I remain calm
in spite of the fact that this

11:36.905 --> 11:38.505
one here is
dressed like this.

11:38.507 --> 11:40.006
Uh...
That's just crazy.
Yeah, it is weird.

11:40.008 --> 11:42.075
This girl in the sweater?
He's been doing it all day.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.910
You think that's...?
Can you just...
can you just drop it?

11:43.912 --> 11:45.112
Well, I would if she wouldn't
always be sitting in my eyeline.

11:45.114 --> 11:47.748
Then again, that
is what she does.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.249
She wants me
looking at her at all times.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.418
She's driving me nuts,
I'll tell you.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.420
Maybe I'll send her
a drink or something.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.956
A virgin daiquiri
for the virgin?
MAC: Guys, guys, guys, guys,

11:55.958 --> 11:58.425
guys, guys, guys, guys, I've got
news, I've got terrible news.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.927
Oh, see this is exactly
what I wanted a vacation from.
CHARLIE: Of course you do.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.963
There are two guys
in this church...
DENNIS:
Yeah.

12:02.965 --> 12:04.364
...that are gay.

12:04.366 --> 12:05.632
Who's the other guy?

12:05.634 --> 12:08.869
(laughter)

12:08.871 --> 12:11.772
I don't get the joke.
(overlapping chatter)

12:11.774 --> 12:15.442
What's wrong with
that? So what?
Well, guys,
being gay is not Christian.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.277
(electrical buzzing)
DENNIS:
Oh!

12:17.279 --> 12:19.546
Oh, see? That's...
that's freaking me out.

12:19.548 --> 12:21.281
That's the big man!
That's the big man.
I don't know what it is,

12:21.283 --> 12:23.884
but I don't like it.
Let's go find our beer, man.

12:23.886 --> 12:26.453
We're gonna go snoop around,
see if we can find our beer.
Let's look for some alcohol.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.054
Recover that beer
and bring some back.

12:28.056 --> 12:30.056
Yeah. Don't take 'em all.
And why is...?

12:30.058 --> 12:31.792
MAN:
Ladies and gents,

12:31.794 --> 12:33.794
it's talent show time.
Please welcome

12:33.796 --> 12:36.129
Marlene, the magician.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.899
That's the bitch
who stole my chair!

12:38.901 --> 12:41.968
Magic? The dark arts?
Are you guys serious?

12:41.970 --> 12:44.571
First the queers.
Then sorcery?

12:44.573 --> 12:46.807
This cruise is going
straight to hell.
Okay.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.342
I'm out of here!
All right. See ya.

12:49.344 --> 12:50.477
Peace be with you.

12:50.479 --> 12:51.912
We're not saying that other bit.
No.

12:51.914 --> 12:53.413
Aah!

12:53.415 --> 12:54.815
For my first trick tonight,

12:54.817 --> 12:56.249
I'm going to need a volunteer.

12:56.251 --> 13:01.154
Hmm. Hey, you, bird girl.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.924
Come on up.
Can you believe
this bitch?

13:03.926 --> 13:05.325
(laughs)
Go. Go up.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.993
I don't...
Bird girl.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.830
Yes, we call her bird.
We also call her a bird.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.932
(thunderclaps)

13:11.934 --> 13:15.202
Oh, baby. See? These costumes
are a great idea, Frank.

13:15.204 --> 13:16.770
(laughs)
So we can go anywhere
we want on the ship now.

13:16.772 --> 13:18.672
Anywhere we want.
And nobody's gonna know.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.841
That's not exactly the first
mate's costume I had in mind.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.509
Hey, man, you said
"first mate."
That's gonna do.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.444
I was, like, Gilligan.
That's the only guy I know.

13:24.446 --> 13:25.846
Yeah, no.
It's good. It's good.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.447
All right,
so what do you think?

13:27.449 --> 13:28.849
We find the captain's quarters,

13:28.851 --> 13:30.350
kick down the door,
find our beer.
Oh, no.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.718
Strangle the guy
or something.
Oh, no, no.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.386
That beer? That beer
is long gone.

13:33.388 --> 13:34.888
No, we don't want
to do that.
Drank it, huh?

13:34.890 --> 13:36.456
Oh, the party is
right down here.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.958
And right down here
below deck.
This is the party?

13:37.960 --> 13:39.359
That's right. This is it.
I don't hear anything.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.727
All I see is a bunch of pipes.

13:40.729 --> 13:41.962
How is this a party?
The pipes are the party.

13:41.964 --> 13:44.130
The pipes are the party?
Yeah.

13:44.132 --> 13:45.365
What are you talking about?
Well, all the booze
we're ever gonna need is

13:45.367 --> 13:47.200
running through these pipes.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.569
So, what? Wait, wait. We're just
gonna drink straight boat fuel?

13:49.571 --> 13:52.138
No. We're gonna cut it.

13:52.140 --> 13:53.206
With what?

13:53.208 --> 13:54.708
Mixers.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.877
Hmm?
Mmm.

13:56.879 --> 14:00.714
(chuckles)
Oh, good. Yeah,
you got one of those.

14:00.716 --> 14:04.484
(clang)
Lord, hear my prayer!

14:04.486 --> 14:06.987
The only reason I went to
this church in the first place

14:06.989 --> 14:09.823
was to become closer to you!

14:09.825 --> 14:14.227
Well, that and the other church
was getting super Vietnamese.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.230
I just need to know my purpose!

14:17.232 --> 14:20.400
I-I used to think it was worship

14:20.402 --> 14:22.435
and then song and dance!

14:22.437 --> 14:24.905
I got to be honest,
I've really taken to it,

14:24.907 --> 14:26.573
and I think musicals
are gonna become

14:26.575 --> 14:29.242
a huge part of my life
moving forward!

14:29.244 --> 14:31.177
But now
with these gay Christians,

14:31.179 --> 14:33.580
I don't know!

14:33.582 --> 14:35.749
I need you to show me a sign

14:35.751 --> 14:37.751
to tell me my purpose here!

14:37.753 --> 14:39.119
Maybe some lightning!

14:39.121 --> 14:41.955
Maybe some thunder?

14:41.957 --> 14:44.457
No?

14:44.459 --> 14:47.193
Should I have stuck
with the Vietnamese?

14:47.195 --> 14:49.262
Is this your card?

14:49.264 --> 14:52.198
(applause)

14:52.200 --> 14:53.934
DEE:
Can I...
can I have the deck, please?

14:53.936 --> 14:56.436
I-I got a trick that'll blow
you guys out of the water.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.772
Wait, I'm confused. Is that a
challenge or a terrorist threat

14:58.774 --> 15:00.440
to the ship?
(laughs)
(rimshot)

15:00.442 --> 15:01.374
(Dee laughs
mockingly)

15:01.376 --> 15:03.109
Give me the goddamn deck.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.644
By all means.

15:04.646 --> 15:07.113
Pick a card, any card.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.949
Hmm...

15:08.951 --> 15:12.052
Now take a good look
at that card, please.

15:12.054 --> 15:13.987
You might want to bring
it a little bit closer,

15:13.989 --> 15:16.456
just so you can see it well.
A little bit closer. Great.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.659
Now, tell me, what
suit is your card?

15:19.661 --> 15:22.963
Spades.
Spades. Ooh. All right.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.665
Now watch while I turn

15:25.667 --> 15:28.735
these spades into stars.
Oh!

15:28.737 --> 15:30.170
(gasping)
DEE:
Oh, shit!

15:30.172 --> 15:31.972
Who's getting shit on now,
bitch?

15:31.974 --> 15:33.239
MARLENE:
What is wrong with you?

15:33.241 --> 15:35.642
You knocked out my tooth!

15:35.644 --> 15:38.812
(booing)
Did I? That wasn't the plan.
I didn't mean to-- I-I'm sorry.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.180
I didn't mean
to do that.

15:40.182 --> 15:41.982
Get off the
stage, bird girl!

15:41.984 --> 15:44.484
She stole my chair at the pool,
and I got so hot about it.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.653
Hey, hey. What?
No, no, no, no, no!

15:46.655 --> 15:49.322
Yeah!

15:49.324 --> 15:51.992
What? No. Aw, no, come on!

15:51.994 --> 15:54.995
Well, what is this, boat jail?

15:54.997 --> 15:58.164
I'm not
a goddamn Somali pirate, okay?

15:58.166 --> 15:59.933
No, wait, wait! Ah...

15:59.935 --> 16:01.401
Goddamn it.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.110
MAN (over radio):
...thunderstorms, capable
of producing gale-force winds...

16:10.112 --> 16:12.445
The storm's worsening,
Captain. What should we do?

16:12.447 --> 16:13.780
FRANK:
Fire the torpedoes!

16:13.782 --> 16:17.517
What?
Full steam ahead!

16:17.519 --> 16:19.886
Christ, not you again!
CHARLIE:
Frank, I think I found

16:19.888 --> 16:21.721
where he's hiding the beer!
What do you got, Charlie?

16:21.723 --> 16:25.025
No, no, it's just, like,
wires and stuff. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.693
Put these men
in the brig.

16:26.695 --> 16:30.130
Charlie.
Ah, get your hands off...
Wait, wait.

16:30.132 --> 16:32.298
I'll dispose of those.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.567
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know where...
No, no,
don't let him drink that!

16:34.569 --> 16:36.970
Don't let him drink
our torpedo juice!

16:36.972 --> 16:39.973
(sighs)

16:39.975 --> 16:42.409
Dee?

16:42.411 --> 16:44.210
What'd you get
thrown in for?

16:44.212 --> 16:47.547
I couldn't control my wrath.
You?
Yeah.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.549
Gluttony.
Yeah.

16:49.551 --> 16:52.218
Been drinking boat fuel
and shit.
Oh, sure.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.220
Sure.
Yeah.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.489
Oh... hello.

16:56.491 --> 16:58.324
(thunder rumbles)

16:58.326 --> 17:01.961
Wow. I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you there.

17:03.732 --> 17:07.834
Anyway, I, um... I should have
introduced myself earlier.

17:07.836 --> 17:09.769
I'm the daiquiri man,

17:09.771 --> 17:12.238
but I suspect you already knew
that, didn't you?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.506
(chuckles softly)

17:13.508 --> 17:16.076
Was it good? Was it sweet?

17:16.078 --> 17:17.610
I guess.

17:17.612 --> 17:20.280
Well, it either was
or it wasn't.

17:20.282 --> 17:22.282
Yeah.
Yeah. Of course.

17:22.284 --> 17:24.684
Yeah. No, I had one, too.
It was... it was sweet.

17:24.686 --> 17:26.519
You seem sweet.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.289
I've been watching you

17:29.291 --> 17:31.424
and following you, of sorts.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.426
You know, in a good way.

17:33.428 --> 17:36.629
So how'd you like
that magic show?

17:36.631 --> 17:38.098
Do you enjoy magic?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.601
You know, I-I can
do magic. Whoop.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.770
Uh, how did you get that?
Get your license?

17:43.772 --> 17:45.305
Don't worry about it.

17:45.307 --> 17:48.541
1996, though. That's good.
That makes the cutoff.

17:48.543 --> 17:51.311
There you go. I
wasn't gonna steal it.

17:51.313 --> 17:53.313
(clears throat)
Um...

17:53.315 --> 17:56.316
So, how about this storm, huh?

17:56.318 --> 17:58.284
I think it's kind
of cool, you know?

17:58.286 --> 18:00.553
Here we are on a boat, you know,
out in the middle of...

18:00.555 --> 18:03.223
out in the middle of nowhere,
and nobody would ever hear

18:03.225 --> 18:05.458
our screams in this wind,
you know.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.660
Oh.
(chuckles)

18:07.662 --> 18:10.497
The thunder's really... It's
throwing this whole thing off.

18:10.499 --> 18:12.499
It's making everything
I say seem sinister,

18:12.501 --> 18:14.901
which it's not intended to
be, you know what I mean?

18:14.903 --> 18:16.970
What's up?
I-I'm sorry. I have to go.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.472
No, no, no, no,
no. No. Sorry, no.

18:19.474 --> 18:22.041
It's... There's nowhere to go.
(chuckles)

18:23.478 --> 18:24.744
There's really nowhere to go.

18:24.746 --> 18:26.146
You know? So...

18:26.148 --> 18:29.082
why don't I, uh,
come in your room?

18:29.084 --> 18:32.652
(chuckles)
"Come in your room."
That's not what I meant.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.655
I would like to go in your room.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.491
Um, and I suspect that maybe...

18:38.493 --> 18:40.160
you might say no, and yet...

18:40.162 --> 18:42.829
I also feel
like maybe...

18:42.831 --> 18:45.532
you wouldn't dare.

18:45.534 --> 18:47.600
(screams)

18:47.602 --> 18:52.005
Well, that's not supposed
to happen.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.040
Guys, come on, come on!
It was a misunderstanding!

18:54.042 --> 18:56.676
The storm made it seem
way worse than it is.

18:56.678 --> 19:00.513
She was never
in any danger.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.514
Lust?

19:01.516 --> 19:04.584
Yeah.

19:09.724 --> 19:11.124
Oh, my God, Mac.

19:11.126 --> 19:12.625
You're soaking wet.
Are you okay?

19:12.627 --> 19:14.227
Yeah.
I was out in the rain

19:14.229 --> 19:15.695
looking for a sign from God.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.063
I never got the timing right,

19:17.065 --> 19:18.364
but doesn't matter.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.866
The point is,
I thought I was here

19:19.868 --> 19:21.734
for you guys to open my mind.

19:21.736 --> 19:25.305
But now I realized
I'm here to close yours!

19:25.307 --> 19:26.706
I'm sorry, what?

19:26.708 --> 19:29.475
Guys, I'm here to convert you.

19:29.477 --> 19:31.978
From being gay.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.380
You want to convert us?
Yeah!

19:34.382 --> 19:36.749
You realize
how insulting that is?

19:36.751 --> 19:39.385
How would you like it
if I tried to convert you?

19:39.387 --> 19:40.587
Uh... I wouldn't care.

19:40.589 --> 19:42.589
'Cause that's, like, impossible.

19:42.591 --> 19:44.891
There's no way you guys could
convert me to your lifestyle.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.227
Let's give it a shot.

19:49.831 --> 19:51.831
Well...

19:51.833 --> 19:53.933
I'm gay.

19:53.935 --> 19:55.602
Yeah.
No shit.

19:55.604 --> 19:57.670
Oh, you guys knew this already?

19:57.672 --> 19:59.172
That you were gay?
From the day we met.

19:59.174 --> 20:00.440
Oh, my God, I've been trying...
Yeah, always.

20:00.442 --> 20:01.674
Whoa, really?
But what's going on?

20:01.676 --> 20:03.443
Did you just get tossed in here?

20:03.445 --> 20:05.845
Or, like, why are you in here?
Oh, no, I just walked in
on my own.

20:05.847 --> 20:07.914
What?!
You let the
door close behind you?!

20:07.916 --> 20:09.349
I couldn't find you guys.
I wanted to hang out.

20:09.351 --> 20:10.783
I had something
important to tell you.

20:10.785 --> 20:13.186
What is it?
There is no God.

20:13.188 --> 20:14.921
Well, what?!
What is
happening right now?

20:14.923 --> 20:16.089
Why, where are you
getting this from?
Yeah, why...

20:16.091 --> 20:17.590
I was like...
(sighs) Okay.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.025
If there was a God,
there's no way

20:19.027 --> 20:20.460
that he would make me queer,
right?

20:20.462 --> 20:22.362
I can't, I can't
listen to this anymore.

20:22.364 --> 20:23.596
I got to get out of here.
I can't be around you.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.531
I've got to get
out of here!

20:25.533 --> 20:26.766
Got to get out of here!

20:26.768 --> 20:27.800
What are you squawking about?

20:27.802 --> 20:29.702
Let me out of here!

20:29.704 --> 20:30.770
Honestly,
what's the point anyway?

20:30.772 --> 20:32.138
There's no meaning to any of it.

20:32.140 --> 20:33.539
There's no God,
there's no heaven,

20:33.541 --> 20:34.874
there's no hell.
Wrong!

20:34.876 --> 20:36.442
Oh, I just wanted
a couple of days.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.810
Just a couple of days
away from you guys.

20:37.812 --> 20:39.112
But I can't escape you!

20:39.114 --> 20:40.613
You know where hell is, Mac?

20:40.615 --> 20:41.614
You know where hell is?
It's right here.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.283
It's right now.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.952
We are in hell!

20:45.954 --> 20:48.454
(yells)
Oh, Jesus.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.957
(horn blaring)

20:50.959 --> 20:53.393
What the shit was that?

21:30.365 --> 21:31.931
(trumpet plays off-key fanfare)

21:31.933 --> 21:33.366
<i>Brown.</i>
