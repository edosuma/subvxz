Previously on Haven...

a few skeletons in the closet.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.881
In Haven, people have the ability
to do things.

00:08.968 --> 00:12.961
Why should I waste the bureau's time
and your talents on this nothing little town?

00:13.097 --> 00:15.930
Because I understand these people,
Agent Howard.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.090
People like me, we're different.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.637
You seriously can't feel pain?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.806
No. I can't feel anything.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.555
-Chief Wuornos, this is...
-Special Agent Audrey Parker.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.765

00:25.902 --> 00:27.358
NATHAN: / call my boss "the Chief".

00:27.445 --> 00:29.857
Duke Crocker.
I've known him since he was five.

00:29.947 --> 00:30.982
He’s all bad.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.106
Somebody out there with a tattoo
wants to kill me.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.524
-What's wrong?
-I can feel you.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.362
I'm sorry about this, Nathan.
There's just no simple answers here.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.946
What are you trying to hold together?

00:40.082 --> 00:41.117
Why, Haven, of course.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.285
(RUMBLING)

00:43.294 --> 00:44.329
Dad.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.745
-Thank you for coming.
-How can we help?

00:47.840 --> 00:50.582
Yeah, if you could pick up the pieces
and put them in this box.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.928
NATHAN: My dad was keeping Haven
from falling apart.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.343
That's yourjob now.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.803
What the hell are you doing in his chair?

00:55.932 --> 00:58.344
New Chief of Police
could do wonders for this town.

00:58.476 --> 01:01.138
The last thing Haven needs is the Rev

01:01.270 --> 01:03.886
and his self-righteous poison
running things.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.597
Excuse me. Are you Audrey Parker?

01:06.692 --> 01:08.603
-And who are you?
-l'm with the FBI.

01:08.694 --> 01:09.945
Answer the question.

01:10.154 --> 01:11.189
Yes.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.732
Haven PD. Who are you?

01:17.703 --> 01:18.988
Who the hell are you?

01:22.375 --> 01:25.583
Okay, why don't we all put our guns down?

01:25.670 --> 01:26.705
NATHAN: No.

01:27.964 --> 01:29.044
VVhy?

01:29.382 --> 01:30.838
Because she knows.

01:31.342 --> 01:34.459
She knows she's a fraud. l'm Audrey Parker.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.669
NATHAN: I know her.

01:36.806 --> 01:39.673
You just came out from under a rock.
Drop the gun!

02:14.510 --> 02:16.546
Mr. Crocker, it's good to see you.

02:16.679 --> 02:18.840
Good to see you darkening the door
of The Good Shepherd.

02:18.931 --> 02:22.094
You know, I don't have
a lot of men of the cloth calling me.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.050
I'm curious.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.226
You said it was important.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.731
It is. Come in. Come on.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.890
No, I think I'll darken the outside for now.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.191
ED: Okay. I'll get right to it then.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.110
I've been thinking a lot about your dad.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.319
You know, he and I were quite close.

02:36.407 --> 02:40.195
He was brave, he was just
and he stood with the righteous.

02:40.286 --> 02:41.696
That doesn't sound like him.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.529
He understood the struggle
that we face here.

02:45.374 --> 02:48.081
And unfortunately,
he was one of its casualties.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.247
My father drowned at sea. I was there.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.880
Why don't you just tell me what you want?

02:56.218 --> 03:00.427
I want to protect our town.
I want to help you.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.050
Okay.

03:04.268 --> 03:05.929
Tell me about this symbol.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.393
When I know where you stand,

03:16.489 --> 03:18.480
I'll be happy to answer
any of your questions.

03:18.783 --> 03:21.399
If you knew me
as well as you're pretending to,

03:22.453 --> 03:23.818
then you would know,

That blood is coming from your plumbing.
So, yeah. I'm calling the police.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.409
In Haven, the police aren't the answer.
To anything.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.710
You're making a big mistake, Officer.

04:14.839 --> 04:15.828
Don't think so.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.330
Watch your head.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.428
So...

04:26.684 --> 04:27.719

04:31.105 --> 04:32.185
You okay?

04:32.773 --> 04:33.853
Fine.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.769
If you say so.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.898
I'm guessing that's her car.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.117
That was a pretty good
fake badge and gun she had.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.359
A laminating machine, red state laws.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.361
Maybe.

04:49.582 --> 04:52.198
But I was someone named Lucy once.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.705
Which could all be part
of someone playing you.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.954
Maybe, but the thing is, is if that were true...

04:58.048 --> 04:59.083
Stop!

04:59.425 --> 05:01.086
She thinks she's you. She's not.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.048
In this town, that means she's troubled.
It's someone we need to deal with.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.378
You're right.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.216
So have you thought about
what we're going to tell people?

05:10.311 --> 05:11.391
About your dad?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.097
Been on my mind.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.557
Nathan, when the Chief of Police dies,
people tend to notice.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.272

we should get her down to the station.

06:41.485 --> 06:44.147
They've sucked up chickens, fish.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.320

06:46.991 --> 06:47.980
Right.

06:48.993 --> 06:51.075
-Thoughts?
-You think she could have caused all this?

06:51.161 --> 06:54.870
The sky did open up and drop frogs
on our heads right after she showed.

-The frogs?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.588
I mean, I've never seen that on Animal Planet.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.545
You sure you didn't bring them here?

07:07.678 --> 07:09.168
Can we go to the police station?

Yeah and it started when she got here,
so I'm going to go down to the station.

Okay.

hangs a left on Witcham,

13:47.661 --> 13:48.821
I'd expect the cops.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.945
Then that's followed by frogs,
gnats and flies.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.038
It's the ten plagues of Exodus.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.250
Haven's become Egypt.

13:57.379 --> 14:00.291

14:00.924 --> 14:02.425

14:03.635 --> 14:06.126
locusts, darkness

14:07.597 --> 14:10.088
and the death of first-born sons.

If I were you, I'd take that last one personally.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.480
You almost look happy.

14:18.692 --> 14:22.731
Happy? No, I'm not happy.
This is my town and it's being punished.

14:22.821 --> 14:25.437
So? You always believed
Haven needed to be punished.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.817
No, no.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.574
I don't want anyone punished.

to ask for God's forgiveness

and to rejoin us all in his love.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.166

anyone's forgiveness.

This has nothing to do with God.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.799
And yet, the plagues are upon us.

Thanks for your time.

14:49.598 --> 14:53.466
Your father,
he chose to live among the cursed

14:53.560 --> 14:56.893
and it destroyed him. And it will destroy you.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.640

15:02.444 --> 15:05.060
and he may welcome you back into his grace.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.608

15:19.586 --> 15:21.247

15:21.338 --> 15:22.828
Sorry, but the Chief...

15:25.008 --> 15:26.919
He needs to be buried.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.345
Yeah, I know. You're right.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.967
But I need to find the time to talk to Nathan,
and now isjust not...

15:33.058 --> 15:37.722
It's not the right time, of course.
But we might be waiting a long time for that.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.638
And Garland deserves to be laid to rest.

15:40.732 --> 15:45.066
We own a piece of the land that would be
a fitting and private resting place.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.607
All right, I'll talk to Nathan.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.154
And while you're talking to him,

15:50.242 --> 15:54.736
ask him if he would like us
to put his name in for interim chief,

15:54.830 --> 15:56.195
and whether he...

16:01.670 --> 16:05.959
So you think I caused
the frogs and the bugs?

16:07.759 --> 16:09.545
What are you thinking,
did I use my magic wand?

16:09.636 --> 16:10.921
Or maybe my tricorder?

16:11.012 --> 16:14.379
Okay, first of all,
a tricorder is just for readings.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.011
Second of all,
this all started when you got here.

I have a lot of work to do,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.158

16:40.792 --> 16:42.953
Frogs here. Gnats here.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.295
Flies. Blood.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.119
You have to put them in the order
that they happened.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.454

Gnats.

16:56.850 --> 16:57.885
Flies.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.808
When one starts, the other stops.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.848
-Not immediately, but soon.
-It's soon.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.101
And they're in geographical sequence, too.

17:08.403 --> 17:12.146
When you add the direction of the bugs...

17:12.449 --> 17:14.565
-They connect.
-Moving east to west.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.695
-Following roads?
-Except for the flies.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.328
Unless he's on foot.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.871
The flies are not following the roads.
They're chasing someone on those roads.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.410
Got anybody in mind?

17:26.671 --> 17:29.538
Yeah, and I'm betting it's that guy
that took off after he crashed his car.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.589
He left on foot
and then the flies followed him.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.507
And I was with you then.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.573
I know he had one when he left here.
That good enough?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.574
Well, did he say why he needed one?

27:04.665 --> 27:06.872
Something about protecting his son.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.371
-From who?
-That's all I know.

27:09.462 --> 27:12.044
-Can I go?
-Do you believe him?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.416
For now.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.627
All right, so who would TJ want to protect
his son from?

27:18.721 --> 27:21.337
From whoever he thinks
is causing the plagues.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.222
Let's go.

27:27.939 --> 27:29.395
You got older brothers?

27:30.399 --> 27:33.186
A couple I know of. Pop liked to travel.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.142
-Come with us.
-Excuse me?

27:35.905 --> 27:37.145
The last plague

27:37.949 --> 27:39.905
is death of the first-born son.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.737
Might be me.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.572
Audrey could need help.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.171
Why does everyone think that I want to help?

27:57.093 --> 28:01.177
Laverne, I need a two mile perimeter
around 55 Crane Street evacuated.

28:01.764 --> 28:05.632
Nathan, hon. Only the Chief can order that.
You need to call him.

28:07.979 --> 28:10.766
Look, if this goes south,
I need you to take care of the Chief.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.439
(DUKE CHUCKLES)

28:13.526 --> 28:15.107
What happened to him, Nathan?

28:15.820 --> 28:16.935
He died.

28:25.496 --> 28:26.781
Nathan, I...

28:27.874 --> 28:29.580
I'm not going to bury your dad.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.500
-You have to. You're the only one who...
-No, I'm not going to do it.

28:33.629 --> 28:36.041
I'm not going to waste
a perfectly good cooler.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.134
-What cooler?
-You don't mean this cooler.

28:45.016 --> 28:46.301
Yeah.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.133
Look.

28:59.572 --> 29:00.812
Locusts?

29:14.378 --> 29:15.879
We're up to darkness.

29:36.359 --> 29:37.940
Why are you here?

29:38.027 --> 29:41.269
-I'm here to help.
-We need to evacuate this area.

29:41.364 --> 29:44.197
Perhaps our prayers for the Shuberts
will be answered and all this will end.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.365
I need to get all these people
out of here, now.

29:46.452 --> 29:50.195
They're here to pray for God's mercy.
And his forgiveness.

29:50.289 --> 29:54.032
And if you love Haven, Nathan, you'll join us.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.993
Okay, I need everybody to move back, now!

29:57.088 --> 29:58.669
They're not going anywhere.

29:58.756 --> 30:01.498
Nathan, we don't have time for this.

30:01.592 --> 30:02.798
Where's TJ?

30:02.885 --> 30:04.591
He's upstairs with the baby.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.585
We tried to stop him. He's got a gun.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.048
-Put down the gun.
-Who are you?

30:45.136 --> 30:46.296
Drop the gun.

30:46.429 --> 30:48.795
I'm not going to hurt my son.
You put down your gun.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.262
Okay.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.302
Okay.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.342
AUDREY 2: What are you doing?

30:57.148 --> 30:58.354
-No...
-Back off.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.353
Just... Trust me.

31:04.447 --> 31:05.687
TJ, what are you doing?

31:05.781 --> 31:09.239
What God's been trying to do all day.
I'm gonna kill myself.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.533
I'm going to stop all this before Aaron...

31:11.620 --> 31:13.076
Aaron still needs a father.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.870
You know what's coming next?

31:14.957 --> 31:18.290
It's death of the first-born son. My son!
Aaron's going to live.

31:18.419 --> 31:21.126
-l'm dead. This all stops.
-You don't know that.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.958
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.332
I just wanted to say goodbye first.

31:26.469 --> 31:29.461
No, God's not doing this, TJ, you are.

31:30.639 --> 31:33.881
You're troubled,
like many of the people in Haven.

31:33.976 --> 31:37.093
And if we don't figure out why,
or how to stop this,

31:37.188 --> 31:39.349
a lot of innocent people will die.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.643
-Hey.
-(AARON CRYING)

31:48.991 --> 31:51.323
TJ: It's happening. The first-born.

31:53.662 --> 31:54.742
ED: No!

31:54.830 --> 31:56.161
Oh, my God!

31:56.540 --> 31:57.950
They're dying.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.334
-l'm here, son.
-(NATHAN GASPING)

32:12.473 --> 32:13.883
(GASPING)

32:16.352 --> 32:18.183
TJ, we need to figure this out.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.394
How much longer are you going to let him
point a gun at us?

32:20.523 --> 32:23.560
Listen, just let me help you, okay?
It's kind of what I do in this town.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.728
-Tell me what happened.
-What happened?

32:26.695 --> 32:30.938
What happened. My wife died.
She died and I wasn't even there.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.365
I know. And that is awful.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.281
But I need you tell me what happened today.

32:36.372 --> 32:39.364
-I drank.
-Did you go anywhere near a Bible?

32:40.668 --> 32:43.034
-Yeah, so?
-Okay. What? When? Tell me.

32:43.420 --> 32:46.662
This morning, when even the liquor
wouldn't work, I tried reading the Bible...

32:46.757 --> 32:48.839
But all that did was remind God I'm still here,

32:48.926 --> 32:51.042
and the plagues have been chasing me
ever since.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.419
You were at The Good Shepherd Church.

32:53.556 --> 32:56.548
That's when this all started.
Did you read Exodus?

32:57.893 --> 32:58.882
Yes.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.893
TJ, it's not God.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.933
It's not the Bible. It's you.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.727
And when you read, you...

33:06.861 --> 33:08.897
(AARON CONTINUES CRYING)

33:13.409 --> 33:14.740
Read this.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.743
(HUSHING)

33:17.955 --> 33:19.365
This is insane.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.576
TJ, read it aloud. Please.

33:22.877 --> 33:24.208
Trust me.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.670
"There was once a velveteen rabbit.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.672
"And in the beginning,
he was really splendid..."

33:34.763 --> 33:35.969
(AARON STOPS CRYING)

33:36.098 --> 33:37.599
Keep going.

33:37.892 --> 33:41.259
"He was fat and bunchy
as a rabbit should be.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.770
-"His coat was a spotted brown and white,
-(AARON GIGGLING)

33:45.941 --> 33:48.648
"and he found that he actually had hind legs.

33:48.777 --> 33:52.611
"Instead of dingy velveteen,
he had brown fur,

"soft and shiny."

34:02.124 --> 34:03.910
"and his whiskers were so long

"He gave one leap

"...he went springing about the turf on them,

34:24.313 --> 34:26.599
"jumping sideways

34:26.732 --> 34:28.973
"and whirling around as the others did.

"to look at the fairy, she had gone."

34:39.286 --> 34:40.321
How you feeling, Nathan?

34:40.955 --> 34:42.911
What if she hadn't pulled it off, Rev?

34:43.332 --> 34:44.993
Some of your parishioners would have died.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.502
They know great struggles
require great sacrifice.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.996
You know what...

34:49.088 --> 34:54.173
So, a couple innocents die,
your position grows stronger.

34:54.260 --> 34:57.673
No, this has nothing to do with me.
I am just a lowly sinnerjust like you are.

34:57.805 --> 35:00.512
You're gonna start a war.
It's what you want, isn't it?

35:00.641 --> 35:03.257
This is a war, Nathan. On evil.

35:03.352 --> 35:04.592
On sin.

35:04.687 --> 35:06.928
Now, I was hoping you would join me.
Both of you.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.638
But you refused me, Nathan. So be it.

35:09.858 --> 35:15.273
Duke, you may not wish to choose a side,
but sooner or later, a side will choose you.

35:15.364 --> 35:19.198
Until then, be careful
of the company you keep.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.860
The lamb can never lie down with the lion.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.458
What the hell he's talking about?

35:31.213 --> 35:33.454
Oh, come on.

35:33.549 --> 35:35.210
Bug infestations,

35:35.301 --> 35:38.839
schizophrenic weather.
How do you keep the tourists away?

35:40.639 --> 35:42.379
Nathan, Audrey, this is Evi.

35:43.225 --> 35:45.557
-Evi Crocker.
-You have a sister?

35:45.644 --> 35:48.977
Unfortunately, I do not have a sister.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.646
No, no. I'm Duke's wife.

35:52.234 --> 35:53.974
-Wife?
-Wife?

35:54.403 --> 35:55.392
Oh.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.562
You never told them about me.

35:58.407 --> 36:00.739
Could you please excuse us for a moment?

36:06.248 --> 36:07.749
Okay. Fine.

36:07.875 --> 36:10.082
Yes, I do care.

36:10.544 --> 36:13.001
Enough that I do not want you
sticking around.

36:14.548 --> 36:16.755
In case you haven't noticed,

36:16.842 --> 36:19.925
dangerous, freakish things
happen in this town.

36:20.054 --> 36:21.089
I know you.

36:21.722 --> 36:24.088
If you stay here, you're going to end up
right in the middle of them.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.089
Duke, I know you, too.

36:26.435 --> 36:29.427
And the only thing you hate more
than small towns are hometowns.

36:29.563 --> 36:32.179
And yet, what, you set up shop here?

36:32.274 --> 36:34.731
And it's time I finally found out why.

36:35.778 --> 36:39.236
I don't know what you're working here,
but I'm going to find out.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.275
Evi...

36:42.743 --> 36:46.031
Believe me, the things that happen here,

36:47.539 --> 36:49.404
you can't work an angle on them.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.376
There's no payday for you here in Haven.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.122
I'll be the judge of that.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.375
See you around.

37:10.229 --> 37:11.594
(DIALLING)

37:18.487 --> 37:20.648
I guess I know
what you want to talk to me about.

37:20.739 --> 37:24.277
People need to be told
the chief is gone, Nathan.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.278
-They deserve to know.
-Tell them he was lost at sea.

37:29.289 --> 37:30.904
Well, that should do it.

37:32.668 --> 37:37.332
I'll talk to the selectmen and have them
appoint you interim chief.

37:40.884 --> 37:41.964
I'll think about it.

37:42.052 --> 37:46.216
We'll print a story in the Herald
about these events.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.592
"Global Warming Comes to Haven"
or something.

38:00.696 --> 38:01.902
(GRUNTING)

38:30.559 --> 38:31.969
What are you doing here?

38:33.687 --> 38:36.349
Just earning a few points
with the new police chief.

38:39.776 --> 38:41.903
You could have told me about your dad.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.654
You could have told me about your wife.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.569
Fair enough.

38:51.955 --> 38:52.990
(SIGHS)

38:54.249 --> 38:56.456
You been thinking at all
about what the Rev said?

38:57.544 --> 38:58.624
No.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.878
Yeah, me neither.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.336
But just so we're clear...

39:07.804 --> 39:09.260
I'm the lion.

39:12.059 --> 39:13.640
(DUKE CHUCKLES)

39:31.286 --> 39:33.618
There are things in this town
that I can't explain.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.412
Me neither. If it makes you feel any better.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.663
But, there is no way
that I have your memories.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.669
You googled me, tailed me, I don't know...

39:42.756 --> 39:44.041
Dayton, Ohio.

39:45.259 --> 39:46.920
My third foster home.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.387
There was a girl there named Theresa.

39:51.139 --> 39:55.052
She told me that foster-dad Jack
had been coming in her room at night.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.346
Drunk.

39:57.563 --> 39:58.973
She was 12 years old.

39:59.815 --> 40:01.976
So I waited up for him the next night.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.479
He stank of cigarettes and vodka.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.185
And when he turned off the lights,

40:06.280 --> 40:07.770
and he came for her,

40:10.075 --> 40:12.157
I put some scissors in his neck.

40:15.122 --> 40:17.078
He didn't even know how it happened.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.615
But he never touched her again.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.497
It's why I became a cop.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.307
Mickey Mouse scissors?

40:38.729 --> 40:40.811
I never told anyone that.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.561
Neither have I.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.864
Until now.

40:58.415 --> 41:00.872
Okay. Looks like the cavalry's here.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.291
Yeah.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.585
Yeah, looks like.

41:06.715 --> 41:09.707
Okay. When you go in there,
don't tell them anything.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.002
We'll figure this out.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.593
-Agent Parker.
-Special Agent Howard.

41:21.855 --> 41:24.688
Now then,
the woman who stole your identity,

41:25.400 --> 41:26.515
where is she?

41:28.612 --> 41:30.352
She is...

41:33.659 --> 41:34.865
In the wind.

41:35.619 --> 41:36.950
I'm sorry, sir.

41:37.037 --> 41:39.619
I think she was headed
toward the Canadian border.
