00:55.046 --> 00:58.449
C'mon folks! Bet!

00:58.483 --> 01:01.051
It's yours man, it's all
yours. You have the thing!

01:06.255 --> 01:08.258
I'd place a bet on George
Dixon if I were you, Jackson.

01:08.292 --> 01:10.593
It's illegal, Henry. We're constables.

01:10.628 --> 01:13.696
- We are off duty constables.
- Even so. I'd rather enjoy

01:13.731 --> 01:15.698
the fight unfettered.

01:15.733 --> 01:18.200
OK, but Little Chocolate is sure to win.

01:18.235 --> 01:20.336
He's pound for pound the
finest fighter there is.

01:20.371 --> 01:24.674
He's Canadian, no less. It's
almost unpatriotic not to bet.

01:24.708 --> 01:26.809
Then why don't you bet on him, Henry?

01:26.843 --> 01:28.811
Don't have any more money on me.

01:28.845 --> 01:31.447
- Ha! Ha! What a surprise.
- I gave it all to George

01:31.482 --> 01:33.449
for the detective's bachelor party.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.517
That is not an excuse. I contributed, too.

01:35.551 --> 01:38.553
I doubt Detective Murdoch
even wants a party.

01:38.588 --> 01:40.956
No, thank you.

01:43.020 --> 01:47.596
I'm writing. Leave me be.

01:47.630 --> 01:49.965
Yeah! You gotta move and stick!

02:09.283 --> 02:12.887
Robert Parker and Harry
Longabaugh, hold it right there!

02:25.200 --> 02:27.601
What kind of crackpot draws
a pistol at a boxing match?

02:27.636 --> 02:29.603
He wouldn't give us so much
as his name until he spoke

02:29.638 --> 02:32.707
- to someone of authority, sir.
- Well, then it's his lucky day.

02:32.741 --> 02:35.075
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

02:35.109 --> 02:40.214
This is my station house. Who are you?

02:40.248 --> 02:44.885
Bat Masterson.

02:44.919 --> 02:47.554
- Bat Masterson, the lawman?
- None other.

02:47.588 --> 02:50.924
Well let him out, Jackson.

02:50.959 --> 02:54.661
Oh! No need to hurry. It's too late.

02:54.695 --> 02:58.264
Damn shame, I had Robert
Parker and Harry Longabaugh

02:58.298 --> 03:01.701
dead to rights.

03:01.736 --> 03:03.737
- You're saying that...
- Damn right.

03:03.771 --> 03:08.441
Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid are in Toronto.

03:08.476 --> 03:10.844
Bloody hell.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.350
He fought in the Dodge City War.

03:16.357 --> 03:18.581
Sir, he rolled with
Wyatt Earp in Tombstone.

03:18.616 --> 03:21.785
- He's killed 26 people.
- Thank you, George. I'm aware

03:21.819 --> 03:25.889
- of Mr. Masterson's reputation.
- He's quite the lawman.

03:25.923 --> 03:28.591
That doesn't justify
drawing a pistol in public.

03:28.626 --> 03:31.860
Sir, by all accounts, he's
also a bit of a ladies' man.

03:31.895 --> 03:36.198
He claims he saw Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

03:36.233 --> 03:38.700
That's right. They were
at the George Dixon fight.

03:38.735 --> 03:41.904
Mr. Masterson was there covering
it, he's a newspaper writer now.

03:41.939 --> 03:44.573
Unfortunately, Jackson
and Higgins unwittingly

03:44.607 --> 03:47.543
- facilitated the escape.
- Murdoch.

03:47.577 --> 03:50.045
I've assured Mr. Masterson
that Station House Four

03:50.079 --> 03:52.080
will be honoured to assist in the capture

03:52.114 --> 03:56.051
- of Sundance and Butch.
- Uh, sir. Is that necessary?

03:56.085 --> 03:59.354
Bat's the only one that
got a good look at them.

03:59.388 --> 04:01.389
Higgins and Jackson couldn't pick them out.

04:01.424 --> 04:04.525
Rest assured, Detective,
I was a lawman myself.

04:04.560 --> 04:09.664
Yes, yes. You were a
lawman in the United States.

04:09.748 --> 04:12.583
Once a lawman, always a lawman, right?

04:12.618 --> 04:16.387
I've already filed a story
about Butch and Sundance

04:16.422 --> 04:19.524
with my New York paper.
Little publicity might

04:19.558 --> 04:22.091
smoke them out. Now if you'll pardon me,

04:22.127 --> 04:25.630
I would like to telephone my editor.

04:25.664 --> 04:27.965
Tom? My pistol.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.134
Oh, yes of course. Crabtree!

04:30.168 --> 04:32.202
The gun that saved the West, right there.

04:32.237 --> 04:34.772
Please feel free to use my telephone, Bat.

04:34.806 --> 04:37.207
Thank you. Gentlemen.

04:37.242 --> 04:40.677
Sir. He drew his pistol in public.

04:40.711 --> 04:42.812
Are you sure it's wise to give it back?

04:42.847 --> 04:45.115
He didn't mean to fire it,
Murdoch. He wants them alive.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.717
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid. Sir, it will be quite

04:47.752 --> 04:49.986
the feather in Station House Four's cap.

04:50.021 --> 04:52.156
With all due respect,
sir, it's widely accepted

04:52.190 --> 04:55.091
that Butch and Sundance
fled to Argentina last year.

04:55.125 --> 05:00.263
If Bat says he saw them, well
that's good enough for me.

05:03.034 --> 05:06.770
Very well. George, see if
you can find some renderings

05:06.804 --> 05:09.439
- of Butch and Sundance.
- Yes, sir.

05:13.977 --> 05:16.079
- George Dixon.
- Yes?

05:16.113 --> 05:18.314
Inspector Brackenreid, Detective Murdoch.

05:18.348 --> 05:20.716
We understand that you
fought here last night.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.519
Yes. But nobody was here to see me win.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.555
The whole crowd scattered
when that madman pulled a gun.

05:25.589 --> 05:29.491
Yes. Mr. Dixon, could
these two men be the ones

05:29.525 --> 05:32.494
he was aiming at?

05:38.802 --> 05:41.336
That looks like them. But
they don't go by those names.

05:41.370 --> 05:43.338
You know them?

05:43.372 --> 05:45.873
They were at my last fight,
too. Had money on me both times,

05:45.908 --> 05:48.310
but they didn't come back
to collect their winnings.

05:48.344 --> 05:52.247
There was illegal betting on the fight?

05:52.281 --> 05:55.283
- Well yes, but I didn't...
- Tell us where we can find them

05:55.318 --> 05:58.220
- and we'll look past the gambling.
- Are they in trouble?

05:58.254 --> 06:01.422
You should be more concerned
whether you're in trouble or not.

06:04.126 --> 06:07.895
Mr. Dixon provided the names
Arthur Brown and Lucas Hunt.

06:07.930 --> 06:10.064
Well they're hardly going
to get about town as Sundance

06:10.099 --> 06:12.399
and Butch, Murdoch. And
even if they were innocent,

06:12.434 --> 06:14.401
why didn't they return for their winnings?

06:14.436 --> 06:16.403
Mr. Masterson likely put a fright in them.

06:16.438 --> 06:18.572
Well let's nab the pair of
them at the boarding house

06:18.607 --> 06:20.574
- and get to the bottom of this.
- Yes, let's.

06:20.609 --> 06:22.843
Murdoch.

06:22.877 --> 06:25.812
Your upcoming wedding has been
a constant topic of conversation

06:25.847 --> 06:27.814
around the Brackenreid dining table lately.

06:27.849 --> 06:30.917
- Really?
- Margaret was hoping

06:30.952 --> 06:33.186
that she might be of
help planning the affair.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.589
Oh, well. I don't really
anticipate a large ceremony

06:36.624 --> 06:38.859
but I'll be mindful of that, thank you.

06:38.893 --> 06:40.961
Even if you were just to put
her in charge of the flowers.

06:40.995 --> 06:43.897
It might be enough to
shut her up so I could eat

06:43.931 --> 06:46.199
my dinner in peace.

06:46.233 --> 06:47.090
Right.

06:48.255 --> 06:51.724
I can only imagine how
excited you must be, Julia.

06:51.758 --> 06:55.261
- Where will the ceremony be held?
- I don't know, yet.

06:55.296 --> 06:57.125
I suppose I've been putting off
having to make that decision.

06:57.231 --> 06:59.232
- Why is that?
- William would never say

06:59.267 --> 07:01.467
as much but I know it would
mean a great deal to him for us

07:01.502 --> 07:03.770
- to marry in the Catholic church.
- How do you feel?

07:03.805 --> 07:06.839
I'm not sure. But I worry
that in granting him that

07:06.873 --> 07:08.841
I may be betraying my own values.

07:08.875 --> 07:12.144
Perhaps... that's an
issue I should leave to you

07:12.179 --> 07:15.848
and the detective. But I can
offer to arrange a hen party,

07:15.882 --> 07:18.718
- should you want one.
- Perhaps not, considering how

07:18.752 --> 07:21.554
the last one we attended turned out.

07:23.556 --> 07:26.859
This is pure ivory. She's
never failed me once.

07:26.893 --> 07:30.296
- Oh! Ho! Ho!
- Mr. Masterson,

07:30.330 --> 07:33.760
Sundance's sweetheart, Etta Place,
do you think she's in town as well?

07:33.780 --> 07:36.518
I'll be sure to ask when I'm
staring down my gun at them.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.453
The inspector coming back any time soon?

07:41.154 --> 07:43.514
The inspector... uh, it's hard to say ***.

07:43.515 --> 07:45.400
I'm happy to keep you
company in the meantime.

07:49.401 --> 07:51.884
You know, you and I are quite alike.
Birds of a feather if you will.

07:51.892 --> 07:53.360
Mmm? How is that?

07:53.494 --> 07:56.262
Well, we're both lawmen and writers.

07:56.296 --> 07:58.231
Hm. Consider yourself a lawman do you?

07:58.265 --> 08:02.101
How many men have you killed?

08:02.135 --> 08:05.705
Well, I haven't killed any,
per se, but I've roughed up

08:05.740 --> 08:09.375
a good many. A good many.
Anyway, I'll get you a copy

08:09.409 --> 08:11.377
of my book, Curse of the Pharaohs,

08:11.411 --> 08:13.590
it's a rollicking adventure.
I've set myself as the main...

08:13.591 --> 08:14.910
- Mr. Masterson?
- Yes?

08:14.915 --> 08:16.395
Matthew Booth from the Toronto Gazette.

08:16.435 --> 08:19.272
I just read in the New York Telegraph
that you and the constabulary are hot

08:19.277 --> 08:21.478
on the trail of Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

08:21.512 --> 08:23.646
- That's right.
- I'd like to do a story on you.

08:23.681 --> 08:26.248
Lawmen turned sportswriter
chases the infamous Butch

08:26.283 --> 08:29.486
- and Sundance.
- Mm... certainly.

08:29.580 --> 08:32.481
But I can't spare much time.

08:32.515 --> 08:34.817
Is it true you were born in Canada?

08:34.852 --> 08:37.020
Yes... Quebec, but you can
keep that off the record.

08:37.054 --> 08:40.188
I am as American as they come.

08:58.310 --> 09:01.913
You must be Dr. Ogden?

09:02.748 --> 09:07.152
I'm Father Clemence. Welcome.

09:08.186 --> 09:12.290
William's at peace in a way that
I have never known him to be.

09:12.324 --> 09:14.324
- As am I.
- Good.

09:14.359 --> 09:16.460
- We're very happy.
- I'm pleased for

09:16.494 --> 09:20.831
this opportunity to meet you.
What brings you to my church?

09:20.866 --> 09:23.768
I know that it would mean
a great deal to William

09:23.802 --> 09:27.304
for us to marry in the
church, but I'm not a Catholic.

09:27.338 --> 09:30.440
I'm here to ask if there's
any way that I might

09:30.475 --> 09:33.743
- grant him that gift?
- That gift is not yours

09:33.778 --> 09:38.649
- to grant. It's the church's.
- Yes, of course. I understand.

09:38.683 --> 09:42.252
Thank you for your time, Father Clemence.

09:42.287 --> 09:45.822
I did not say that it
couldn't be granted, however.

09:45.856 --> 09:49.059
William painted the picture
to me of a resilient,

09:49.093 --> 09:53.063
determined woman. I'm
surprised you give up so easily.

09:53.097 --> 09:57.233
- I do want this, for William.
- Then if this is something

09:57.267 --> 10:01.071
you really want, I would like
you to consider the following:

10:01.105 --> 10:04.907
why is the belief in God important?

10:04.941 --> 10:10.513
Just think on it for a time.

10:16.019 --> 10:18.221
Why don't you tell me your real names?

10:18.255 --> 10:20.889
You're about to be exposed
for who you really are, anyway.

10:20.924 --> 10:25.260
I told you, sir, I'm Arthur
Brown and this is Lucas Hunt.

10:25.294 --> 10:28.563
- Hah. 'Course you are.
- On what grounds are you holding us?

10:28.598 --> 10:30.432
Suspicion of gambling, for now.

10:30.466 --> 10:32.968
Suspici... Everyone was
betting at the fight!

10:33.002 --> 10:37.105
- Why are we the only ones being held?
- I think you know why. So...

10:37.139 --> 10:40.609
tell me the whereabouts of
your lady friend, Etta Place.

10:40.643 --> 10:43.578
- Etta who?
- It's not them.

10:43.613 --> 10:45.714
I don't even know where that is.

10:45.748 --> 10:49.083
Not the two men you drew down
on or not Butch and Sundance?

10:49.118 --> 10:51.753
Neither.

10:51.787 --> 10:54.122
- Are you sure, Mr. Masterson?
- I've never laid eyes

10:54.156 --> 10:58.960
on these men and they damn
sure aren't Butch and Sundance.

10:58.994 --> 11:01.028
Don't let me catch you
gambling again, boys.

11:03.665 --> 11:05.833
Let's get on with it,
gentlemen. Butch and Sundance

11:05.868 --> 11:09.603
- are still on the loose.
- Mr. Masterson,

11:09.638 --> 11:13.073
is it possible that you were
mistaken in the first place?

11:15.107 --> 11:18.211
I once sat across from Butch Cassidy

11:18.246 --> 11:20.914
at a card table in Hot Springs, Montana.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.550
I'll bet I am the only
man in this city to say

11:23.585 --> 11:26.920
I've looked him in the eye.
And how long ago was that?

11:26.954 --> 11:30.991
A number of years. The
look of a man might change

11:31.025 --> 11:35.728
- but the eyes don't.
- Well, perhaps we'll take

11:35.763 --> 11:38.799
- a wait and see approach, Bat.
- You do what you like,

11:38.833 --> 11:41.534
I'm casting my net.

11:42.068 --> 11:45.538
- Just my luck.
- Excuse me?

11:45.572 --> 11:48.574
Just as the most striking woman I have seen

11:48.609 --> 11:51.744
in all of Toronto enters
the station, I'm leaving.

11:51.779 --> 11:57.016
- Ah, you must be Mr. Masterson.
- Mm, you recognize me

11:57.050 --> 12:00.752
- from the newspapers?
- No...

12:00.787 --> 12:06.125
- My husband-to-be spoke of you.
- Oh. Where is the lucky man?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.961
I wouldn't allow you out of my sight.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.670
- Him?
- That surprises you?

12:18.705 --> 12:21.406
Well, you're obviously a spirited woman

12:21.441 --> 12:24.209
- and the detective is...
- A gentleman?

12:24.243 --> 12:30.615
Yes. Very gentle indeed.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.555
- Julia, thank you for coming.
- What is it, William?

12:37.589 --> 12:42.160
Um, the inspector has
brought to my attention

12:42.194 --> 12:45.230
that Mrs. Brackenreid would
very much like to be involved

12:45.264 --> 12:48.932
in the planning of the wedding.

12:48.967 --> 12:52.770
- Oh... Well perhaps...
- Sirs!

12:52.804 --> 12:55.639
The bank of Toronto's being robbed.

13:00.812 --> 13:04.281
- They're armed.
- It must be Sundance and Butch.

13:04.315 --> 13:06.917
Let's hope it is. By
reputation, they don't use

13:06.951 --> 13:09.386
- their guns unless provoked.
- There's only one way

13:09.420 --> 13:13.823
to find out.
- What... Bat! No!

13:13.858 --> 13:17.494
- I'll take the back!
- George, be careful!

13:17.528 --> 13:19.496
What's going on, Murdoch?

13:19.530 --> 13:23.466
- Go! Let's get outta here!
- I can't tell.

13:30.173 --> 13:33.710
They fled out the back.
Firing their guns as they left.

13:33.744 --> 13:36.746
- George!
- Sir, I'm all right.

13:36.781 --> 13:39.068
- They shot into the air.
- Did you get a look at them, Crabtree?

13:39.216 --> 13:40.211
Sir, they were galloping away

13:40.215 --> 13:43.485
- by the time I got there.
- Um. Um. I... I did.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.323
I... it was Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance K... K... K...

13:47.357 --> 13:52.094
K... K... K... Kid.

13:56.417 --> 13:57.109
Is it true?

13:57.110 --> 13:58.744
Was it Butch and Sundance?

13:58.750 --> 14:01.558
I'll handle this, gentlemen.

14:02.526 --> 14:07.879
Ahem. Indeed, the robbery was
the work of Butch and Sundance.

14:07.885 --> 14:11.354
The manager confirmed as
much and I observed them

14:11.388 --> 14:13.890
with my own eyes yet again.

14:13.924 --> 14:16.860
Did they shoot at you, Mr. Masterson?

14:16.894 --> 14:19.061
Mm. Shots were fired, but
true to their reputation,

14:19.096 --> 14:22.141
they weren't out to
harm anyone, nor I them.

14:22.216 --> 14:25.785
Fortunately I intervened
before they got to the safe.

14:25.819 --> 14:28.654
So you can tell the
fine citizens of Toronto

14:28.688 --> 14:30.957
that Bat Masterson saved their money.

14:30.991 --> 14:33.025
What's next,

14:33.060 --> 14:35.394
- Mr. Masterson? Any leads?
- Inspector.

14:35.428 --> 14:39.331
Rest assured, me and the boys
of Station House Four will

14:39.366 --> 14:42.601
bring them to justice.
It's only a matter of time.

14:42.636 --> 14:45.170
Inspector Brackenreid, what's
it like working alongside

14:45.204 --> 14:47.273
- a legendary lawman?
- Now, now, now.

14:47.307 --> 14:49.708
This isn't about Bat
Masterson. This is about

14:49.743 --> 14:53.812
reigning in two outlaws. Now,
I'll make myself available

14:53.846 --> 14:57.983
to you fine folks as needed,
and uh, I'll continue to file

14:58.017 --> 15:00.752
my updates with the New
York Telegraph. Thank you.

15:00.787 --> 15:02.754
- Mr. Masterson!
- Thank you, gentlemen. That's all for today.

15:02.789 --> 15:05.190
No more questions, thank you.

15:07.726 --> 15:11.162
Gentlemen. I was under the
impression you were coppers.

15:11.196 --> 15:14.766
- Where are your guns?
- We don't carry guns.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.001
North of the border, we rely on our wits.

15:17.035 --> 15:20.004
Ah. Fat lot of good your wits just did us.

15:20.038 --> 15:22.807
Your approach wasn't
especially effective, either.

15:22.841 --> 15:26.143
Fact of the matter is Sundance
and Butch are on the loose.

15:26.178 --> 15:28.145
Bat knows them better than we do, Murdoch.

15:28.180 --> 15:32.183
- He'll take the lead.
- Very well.

15:32.217 --> 15:36.153
- So where should we start, Bat?
- Mm. Take me to the most

15:36.188 --> 15:38.956
reputable house of ill-repute in town.

15:41.993 --> 15:45.195
I don't think I've seen
a dance quite like it.

15:45.229 --> 15:49.333
Reminds me of Afghanistan.
Never thought I'd see it here,

15:49.367 --> 15:52.569
but can't say that I mind.

15:55.573 --> 15:59.108
Thank you Nadia. Wasn't she fantastic?

16:01.879 --> 16:06.149
What can I do for you gentlemen?

16:06.183 --> 16:09.452
Oh! We're looking for Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance kid.

16:09.486 --> 16:13.223
- Have they had occasion to visit?
- I don't believe so.

16:13.257 --> 16:15.558
Oh my goodness. I think they did.

16:15.592 --> 16:18.461
- Those two from the other night.
- How did you know it was them?

16:18.495 --> 16:20.396
Well, they had such an
air of danger about them.

16:20.430 --> 16:24.400
Oh yes, I do recall
them. They were very coy.

16:24.434 --> 16:26.402
It must've been Butch I entertained.

16:26.436 --> 16:29.438
- No, Cynthia, I believe I had Butch.
- Well, I was with one of them.

16:29.473 --> 16:31.707
- I can't wait to tell the other girls.
- Ladies.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.876
Did they mention where they were staying

16:33.910 --> 16:38.080
- or what their intentions were?
- Only that they plan to return.

16:38.114 --> 16:40.983
I hope they do. Such dear gentlemen.

16:41.017 --> 16:43.451
If they do, be sure to notify us.

16:43.486 --> 16:46.454
And despite how charming they may
be, keep in mind that they're outlaws.

16:46.489 --> 16:49.157
Of course.

16:49.192 --> 16:52.727
Perhaps you'd care to continue
this interview in private?

16:52.762 --> 17:06.073
- Are you boys in a hurry?
- I'm afraid we are.

17:11.608 --> 17:15.942
Uh, Butch and Sundance in my... bank...

17:16.012 --> 17:18.346
Possibly. We won't know for certain
until we apprehend the suspects.

17:18.381 --> 17:21.510
The most famous b...
bank robbers in history.

17:22.018 --> 17:25.988
Surely they only target the b... best.

17:26.321 --> 17:28.823
The most vulnerable, I
should think, Mr. Fleet.

17:28.857 --> 17:31.960
This is no cause to boast, Mr. Fleet.

17:31.994 --> 17:34.562
You should be grateful no one was hurt.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.999
Oh, I am. Thanks to
Mr. Masterson's bravery.

17:38.534 --> 17:41.769
Was there any indication that the robbers

17:41.804 --> 17:44.772
- had been surveying the bank?
- None that I'm aware of,

17:44.807 --> 17:49.076
b... but, um... B... Butch and Sundance

17:49.110 --> 17:52.079
picked a... a most
fortuitous day to strike.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.348
- How's that?
- Well, the Grand Trunk Railway

17:54.382 --> 17:58.152
had just dep... uh... dep...
uh... deposited a large sum

17:58.186 --> 18:00.455
to cover their uh... p... payroll.

18:00.489 --> 18:02.182
Sir, were you able to discern
anything from the bullets

18:02.187 --> 18:04.321
- took from the ceiling?
- Only that they indeed came

18:04.355 --> 18:06.857
from the robber's gun. 45 calibre.

18:07.092 --> 18:09.426
Sir, I was wondering if
I might treat you dinner

18:09.461 --> 18:12.763
- the night after tomorrow?
- Well that's very kind, George,

18:12.798 --> 18:15.666
thank you. But I believe
I'm engaged to dine

18:15.701 --> 18:17.968
- with Dr. Ogden that night.
- Yes, of course.

18:18.003 --> 18:20.404
The wedding is coming up
so soon, isn't it, sir?

18:20.438 --> 18:22.406
- I suppose so.
- Have you decided where

18:22.440 --> 18:24.408
the two of you will
live once you're married?

18:24.442 --> 18:26.410
As a matter of fact, George,
I intend to build us a house.

18:26.444 --> 18:28.412
But I suppose Mrs. Kitchen's

18:28.446 --> 18:31.748
- will have to do in the meantime.
- Oh, sir. The boarding house?

18:31.782 --> 18:34.651
Will Dr. Ogden be keen on that arrangement?

18:34.685 --> 18:37.253
I don't see why not. Mrs.
Kitchen is a fine cook,

18:37.287 --> 18:39.856
her beef stew is the best I've ever had.

18:39.891 --> 18:43.593
- That considered...
- Uh, Inspector?

18:43.628 --> 18:47.163
- Wh... what are you doing?
- Waiting for Bat.

18:47.197 --> 18:50.900
- Where is he?
- He's conducting a...

18:50.934 --> 18:53.903
private interview.

18:53.937 --> 18:57.407
Ah. Right.

19:15.992 --> 19:20.128
... He took his pistol... I raised mine...

19:20.163 --> 19:22.665
The bank of Toronto was
flush with a recent deposit

19:22.699 --> 19:26.268
to cover the Grand Trunk railway
payroll. A very fortuitous time

19:26.302 --> 19:29.071
- for the robbers to strike.
- We considered the possibility

19:29.105 --> 19:31.306
it may have been the work
of the bank employees,

19:31.340 --> 19:33.475
but all the rail boys seem legitimate.

19:33.509 --> 19:36.144
I must admit... the
particulars of the robbery

19:36.179 --> 19:39.948
are very consistent with how
Butch and Sundance operated.

19:39.982 --> 19:42.183
Were you and Mr. Masterson able
to turn up anything useful, sir?

19:42.217 --> 19:46.487
- I say that I always get my man.
- Sir?

19:46.521 --> 19:49.156
Yes, yes, yes. Good work, Murdoch.

19:49.191 --> 19:52.794
I said of course, but you
can never touch my pistol.

19:56.098 --> 19:58.099
I will turn it over to the good Inspector.

19:58.133 --> 20:00.101
Inspector Brakenreid, Bat
says you're narrowing in

20:00.135 --> 20:02.069
on Butch and Sundance. Is that true?

20:02.104 --> 20:05.106
We're pursuing every avenue
of investigation, gentlemen.

20:05.140 --> 20:08.809
It's only a matter of time
before Mr. Masterson and myself

20:08.843 --> 20:10.844
apprehend the buggers.

20:33.631 --> 20:34.590
Reach for the sky.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.429
Oh dear Lord. Please don't shoot!

20:43.360 --> 20:45.361
- Flower.
- Bloody fake.

20:45.395 --> 20:47.363
How were we to know it wasn't real?

20:47.397 --> 20:50.633
- Sure looked real to me.
- What were you transporting?

20:50.668 --> 20:53.703
The payroll to Grand
Trunk office in Simcoe.

20:53.737 --> 20:57.422
- They got it all.
- Why would Sundance and Butch kill a man?

20:58.233 --> 20:59.942
What exactly happened?

20:59.977 --> 21:03.946
Harry was trying to protect
the payroll. The man who called

21:03.981 --> 21:07.316
himself Sundance shot him
down. Never saw a man handle

21:07.351 --> 21:10.719
a weapon like that.

21:10.753 --> 21:13.689
We've checked everything here,
sir. There's no sign of him.

21:16.125 --> 21:19.060
What else do you need to know? I saw them.

21:19.095 --> 21:21.396
It as Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid. Plain as day.

21:21.430 --> 21:24.032
You said they were gentlemen outlaws.

21:24.066 --> 21:28.636
Why would they gun down
an innocent man like this?

21:28.670 --> 21:32.507
Mr. Masterson?

21:32.541 --> 21:34.742
I'll meet you back at the Station House.

21:34.776 --> 21:37.778
I have to think on this.

21:39.781 --> 21:42.917
- At what time were the criminals spotted?
- Are you any closer to

21:42.951 --> 21:45.987
- capturing Butch and Sundance?
- Hey, knock it off, you lot! Back it up!

21:46.021 --> 21:49.272
- Back up!
- I should throw them all in jail.

21:49.590 --> 21:50.658
Oh, I thought you were quite

21:50.692 --> 21:53.193
- enjoying all of the attention.
- Not anymore.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.262
- Sirs?
- So where is he?

21:55.296 --> 21:57.798
I don't know, sir. I've been
in touch with the Telegraph,

21:57.833 --> 22:00.067
he's missed his deadline for
his story, they haven't been

22:00.101 --> 22:02.669
- in contact with him.
- Why would he disappear now?

22:02.703 --> 22:04.971
You'd think he'd be
wallowing in all of this.

22:05.006 --> 22:08.409
Unless... what if he's
gone to find them himself?

22:08.443 --> 22:11.211
He has no authority to make an arrest.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.147
You've met the man, Murdoch.
You think he gives a damn

22:13.181 --> 22:16.816
about authority? Get your hat.

22:24.158 --> 22:26.693
Good day, gentlemen. How can I help you?

22:26.727 --> 22:29.629
Madame Dupree. You can tell the girls

22:29.664 --> 22:33.466
- this is not a social call.
- What a shame, Inspector.

22:39.073 --> 22:41.040
We're looking for Bat Masterson.

22:41.075 --> 22:43.876
So am I. A number of the
girls have inquired as to when

22:43.910 --> 22:47.680
- he would be visiting again.
- He hasn't been here?

22:47.714 --> 22:50.315
No. Not recently.

22:50.349 --> 22:53.085
Do you know where in
Toronto that he might be

22:53.119 --> 22:56.055
- hanging his hat?
- Cynthia?

22:56.089 --> 22:58.057
- Yes, Madame Dupree?
- Where did you say

22:58.091 --> 23:01.594
- Mr. Masterson took you?
- The Alexander hotel.

23:01.628 --> 23:04.129
He bought me a cocktail,
he was ever so kind.

23:04.163 --> 23:06.298
Thank you.

23:15.641 --> 23:18.042
- Detective Murdoch.
- Yes?

23:18.077 --> 23:20.245
Cynthia would like you to
know she is available for a...

23:20.279 --> 23:22.914
private interview.

23:22.948 --> 23:28.586
Um, thank you. Ah... no thank you.

23:28.621 --> 23:31.288
Soon to be married.

23:31.323 --> 23:33.992
Then perhaps all the more reason.

23:42.134 --> 23:44.568
Good day, ladies.

23:44.703 --> 23:48.318
And have you considered what
I asked of you, Dr. Ogden?

23:48.348 --> 23:50.483
- As a matter of fact, I have.
- And?

23:50.517 --> 23:53.119
Tell me about the cruelty of God.

23:53.154 --> 23:56.455
- Is God cruel?
- I treat diseases of the mind,

23:56.490 --> 23:59.158
people driven into madness
by no fault of their own.

23:59.192 --> 24:01.160
When I worked as a
coroner, I saw the results

24:01.194 --> 24:04.096
- of unspeakable violence.
- Not perpetrated by God.

24:04.130 --> 24:08.066
- But permitted by God.
- God does not permit anything.

24:08.101 --> 24:11.671
God grants us life. What
we do with that life,

24:11.705 --> 24:13.839
that's... that's up to you and me.

24:13.873 --> 24:16.374
And what does it matter
if I believe or not?

24:16.409 --> 24:19.311
Because your eternal
soul will never find peace

24:19.345 --> 24:21.579
unless you believe in
the teachings of Christ.

24:21.614 --> 24:24.316
Christ teaches love,
Christ teaches forgiveness,

24:24.350 --> 24:27.820
- Christ teaches joy.
- And fealty.

24:27.854 --> 24:33.224
Yes, the church may try to
teach fealty. Christ does not.

24:45.737 --> 24:47.805
I wagered you'd be out trying
to bring in Sundance and Butch

24:47.840 --> 24:49.941
- on your own.
- No.

24:49.975 --> 24:54.178
- Why?
- Because this is my fault.

24:54.213 --> 24:56.447
Would you care to explain that?

24:56.481 --> 25:00.852
There is no Butch and
Sundance. Not here, anyways.

25:00.886 --> 25:05.021
- But you saw them?
- I was sure I did at the Dixon

25:05.056 --> 25:08.359
fight but when you brought
in those two men, I realized

25:08.393 --> 25:10.927
they were the men that I saw at the fight

25:10.962 --> 25:15.332
and I realized that they
weren't Butch and Sundance.

25:15.367 --> 25:19.469
You lied. Why?

25:19.503 --> 25:23.840
There was a time when the
name Bat Masterson was admired

25:23.875 --> 25:26.776
and feared and worshipped.

25:26.810 --> 25:29.312
When I wrote that story
about Butch and Sundance,

25:29.347 --> 25:32.648
those days came back. I
was Bat Masterson again

25:32.683 --> 25:36.252
on the trail of two outlaws
and I revelled in it.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.954
You made it up.

25:38.989 --> 25:41.223
And now a man's dead and
we've been wasting our time

25:41.258 --> 25:44.193
chasing after phantoms.
I've a good mind to...

25:44.227 --> 25:48.698
Sir. None of that changes
the fact that there are still

25:48.732 --> 25:51.133
two criminals at large.

25:51.167 --> 25:54.536
They've shot someone and robbed a bank.

25:54.570 --> 25:57.106
Bloody hell.

25:57.140 --> 26:01.110
Murdoch, I'll see you back at the station.

26:07.583 --> 26:10.218
I caused you to look the
wrong way in all of this.

26:10.252 --> 26:13.755
Yes you did. And I'll
wager that those two men

26:13.790 --> 26:18.159
were far from wild west
outlaws. Just two common thugs

26:18.193 --> 26:21.996
who took advantage of
a situation you created.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.502
Will you help me find them?

26:32.174 --> 26:34.842
Once a lawman, always a lawman. Right?

26:38.447 --> 26:42.550
- Thank you, Detective.
- We're in pursuit of the felons

26:42.584 --> 26:44.585
and we'll be arresting them anytime soon.

26:44.619 --> 26:48.489
- Is Mr. Masterson helping?
- Mr. Masterson's service

26:48.523 --> 26:50.658
- is no longer re...
- Mr. Masterson!

26:50.692 --> 26:53.293
- What is going on?
- Mr. Masterson!

26:53.328 --> 26:55.896
Mr. Masterson, are you hot
on the trail of Butch Cassidy

26:55.931 --> 26:58.631
- and the Sundance Kid?
- I am assisting

26:58.666 --> 27:01.701
the Toronto constabulary
to the best of my abilities.

27:01.735 --> 27:04.104
Are you going to catch them, Bat?

27:04.138 --> 27:06.506
I'm more than confident
in Detective Murdoch

27:06.540 --> 27:10.010
and Inspector Brackenreid.

27:10.044 --> 27:12.212
- Alright, that's enough.
- Mr. Masterson just one more

27:12.246 --> 27:15.482
question for your time!
Mr. Masterson, please!

27:15.516 --> 27:18.918
Let's assume that the bandits
who robbed the bank are in fact

27:18.953 --> 27:21.921
the same two who robbed the
train. They match the general

27:21.956 --> 27:24.624
description given by the
bank manager as well as

27:24.658 --> 27:27.193
the surviving guard and
the engineer from the train.

27:27.227 --> 27:29.195
They also knew the most advantageous time

27:29.229 --> 27:31.197
- to strike both targets.
- The bank was holding

27:31.231 --> 27:33.566
the payroll for the Grand
Trunk railway in Toronto,

27:33.601 --> 27:36.969
the train was carrying the Grand Trunk
payroll to one of its subsidiaries

27:37.004 --> 27:39.005
Exactly, sir. Both of
these robberies are linked

27:39.039 --> 27:41.507
by the Grand Trunk railway.
Now, George has cleared all

27:41.541 --> 27:44.477
the bank employees of any
suspicion but the railway

27:44.511 --> 27:46.578
employees would've had inside
knowledge in both cases.

27:46.613 --> 27:49.581
George, we need to pay
their offices a visit.

27:49.616 --> 27:52.150
Sir, right behind you.

27:52.184 --> 27:54.586
It's a shame it wasn't
really Butch and Sundance.

27:54.621 --> 27:57.489
That would've been really something.

27:57.524 --> 28:01.927
- Mr. Masterson?
- Of course.

28:05.464 --> 28:07.432
- What is it, Crabtree?
- Sir, you've yet to contribute

28:07.466 --> 28:09.434
to the detective's bachelor party.

28:09.468 --> 28:11.436
Murdoch doesn't want a bachelor party.

28:11.470 --> 28:12.668
Well perhaps he'll feel
differently once he's there, sir.

28:12.672 --> 28:15.440
Now, I've rented a tavern.
I've asked Mrs. Kitchen to bring

28:15.474 --> 28:18.143
some food. Jackson has it in
his head that he'll play trumpet

28:18.177 --> 28:20.545
but I've explained to him
it's a party for the detective,

28:20.579 --> 28:22.580
- not a godforsaken talent show...
- Crabtree, enough.

28:27.085 --> 28:30.354
Sir... that's a very generous contribution.

28:32.858 --> 28:35.693
It sounds like you're talking
about Ed and Hoyd O'Bannon.

28:35.727 --> 28:39.029
- They quit a couple days ago.
- Sounds like they came into

28:39.064 --> 28:42.099
- some money recently?
- Would you consider them

28:42.133 --> 28:44.935
- smart enough to rob a bank?
- Doesn't take brains

28:44.969 --> 28:47.737
- to rob a bank, just nerve.
- I can't say they were

28:47.772 --> 28:50.240
too clever, but the O'Bannons
weren't short on nerve.

28:50.275 --> 28:52.876
Often showing up to
work drunk or not at all.

28:52.910 --> 28:54.978
Any idea where we could find them?

28:55.012 --> 28:57.881
I'd try the McLeod's
Tavern on Queen Street.

28:57.915 --> 29:00.316
When they were on payroll, they
drank most of it away down there.

29:00.350 --> 29:02.953
Uh, hey...

29:02.987 --> 29:05.321
You're that Bat Masterson
fellow, aren't you?

29:05.355 --> 29:08.491
- I am.
- Ah. I like your sports stories.

29:08.625 --> 29:11.660
You know, reading them
makes me feel like I'm there.

29:11.695 --> 29:15.498
- Thanks for that.
- So if you're looking

29:15.532 --> 29:19.368
for Ed and Hoyd, I'm imagining
there's no Butch and Sundance?

29:19.403 --> 29:24.840
- It would appear not.
- Well, that's a damn shame.

29:33.015 --> 29:35.817
I'm looking for Ed and Hoyd O'Bannon.

29:38.487 --> 29:40.788
Gentlemen. I'd like a word, please.

29:40.823 --> 29:43.758
- About what?
- Your recent good fortune, here.

29:43.992 --> 29:47.294
Perhaps you'd like to come
down to the Station House

29:47.329 --> 29:51.332
and explain how it came to be.

29:54.736 --> 29:56.937
I wouldn't advise running.

29:56.971 --> 30:00.141
I don't miss.

30:00.175 --> 30:03.511
Stick 'em up, boys.

30:08.706 --> 30:10.484
I pulled these bullets from
the ceiling at the bank.

30:10.759 --> 30:13.928
I tested them and they
were fired from your gun.

30:13.962 --> 30:17.264
OK, you got us on that.

30:17.298 --> 30:21.235
- You also killed a man.
- Killed?

30:21.269 --> 30:25.005
W... what are you talking about?

30:25.039 --> 30:27.707
We shot into the ceiling,
just like you said.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.558
I'm not talking about the bank robbery.

30:30.159 --> 30:31.659
I'm talking about the train robbery.

30:32.245 --> 30:34.881
- We didn't actually rob the train.
- Yes, you did.

30:34.915 --> 30:37.384
And you shot a guard in
the back and killed him.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.886
We did no such thing. On my mother's grave,

30:39.920 --> 30:43.218
- we did no such thing.
- It's true that we stopped the train.

30:43.223 --> 30:44.624
With the fake explosives.

30:44.659 --> 30:46.860
The train came to a halt.
The engineer came out.

30:46.894 --> 30:49.202
We tied him up, we left
him in the cab and then

30:49.205 --> 30:50.948
we went to the back of
the train for the loot.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.676
But two armed guards were waiting for us.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.162
We didn't even get close to the money

30:54.168 --> 30:57.404
and he fired a warning shot over
our heads and we just rode off.

30:57.938 --> 31:00.673
You're certain that both guards
were alive when you fled the scene.

31:00.707 --> 31:02.164
Yes, sir.

31:02.665 --> 31:05.935
I'll admit, we did try to rob that
train but we did not kill anyone.

31:09.216 --> 31:12.318
I extracted a bullet
from Mr. Harry Walkins.

31:12.352 --> 31:15.087
- 32 calibre.
- Mmm. Very impressive.

31:15.121 --> 31:17.756
- Lady knows her calibres.
- I pull enough of them out

31:17.791 --> 31:20.092
of bodies, I may as
well learn what they are.

31:20.126 --> 31:22.027
Different than the two I
pulled out of the ceiling

31:22.062 --> 31:24.362
at the bank. Care to hazard a guess?

31:24.397 --> 31:27.066
No need to guess,
Detective. 45's plain as day.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.435
Mmm. More than just a pretty face.

31:30.469 --> 31:33.838
Why Mr. Masterson, you are
old enough to be my father.

31:33.872 --> 31:37.842
Uh, two different crimes,
two different guns.

31:37.876 --> 31:40.178
The train guard was killed
with a 32, you pulled 45's out

31:40.213 --> 31:42.180
- of the bank ceiling.
- I don't think the O'Bannons

31:42.215 --> 31:44.349
- killed this man.
- That's the thing about

31:44.383 --> 31:47.085
Canadian law enforcement,
Mr. Masterson: patience,

31:47.119 --> 31:50.387
diligence, and the reliance on
intellect trump the quick draw

31:50.422 --> 31:54.291
- of the gun every time.
- Anything else, Dr. Grace?

31:54.326 --> 31:58.730
He was killed at close range.

32:19.751 --> 32:23.386
I'd very much like to speak
to that railway guard again.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.789
I believe the Grand Trunk
Railway should reconsider

32:25.823 --> 32:28.825
their hiring practices. First
the O'Bannon boys and now...

32:28.860 --> 32:30.994
- Irem Klaxton.
- Yes, exactly sir.

32:31.028 --> 32:33.730
His employers haven't seen hide
nor hair of him since the robbery.

32:33.765 --> 32:35.402
What did you find out about Mr. Klaxton?

32:35.403 --> 32:38.149
Well, he doesn't come from
the most reputable of families.

32:38.171 --> 32:40.069
Both of his brothers have done jail time.

32:40.103 --> 32:42.204
He avoided the same
only by joining the army.

32:42.239 --> 32:44.340
The British Army wouldn't allow...

32:44.375 --> 32:46.676
The American Army, sir. He
moved to Canada 3 years ago.

32:46.710 --> 32:49.178
Any idea where we might find him, George?

32:49.212 --> 32:52.681
Well, his family does own
a farm north of the city.

32:52.715 --> 32:54.683
As good a place as any to look.

32:54.717 --> 32:56.752
- How far north?
- About 20 miles.

32:56.787 --> 33:01.891
Mmm. You boys know how to ride?

33:01.925 --> 33:05.261
Yeah! Giddy up!

33:45.233 --> 33:48.302
- This the place?
- I guess.

34:00.548 --> 34:04.551
- Don't see anyone.
- Doesn't mean he's not here.

34:04.585 --> 34:06.920
Nothing.

34:08.489 --> 34:12.726
- What was that?
- There's someone here.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.830
Irem Klaxton! Show yourself!

34:16.864 --> 34:19.766
Toronto constabulary!

34:19.800 --> 34:23.870
You're under arrest for
the murder of Harry Walkins.

34:23.904 --> 34:27.306
Might be gone, Murdoch. There
was $5000 stolen from that train.

34:27.340 --> 34:29.308
You think he came to spend it here?

34:29.342 --> 34:32.444
Don't look up, but there's
someone in that hayloft.

34:32.579 --> 34:37.283
Detective, I'm going to find
a place to relieve myself.

34:37.317 --> 34:39.585
Bat!

34:39.619 --> 34:44.090
Irem Klaxton! We need to speak to you!

34:46.426 --> 34:49.561
There's someone behind the
woodshed. They mean to flank us.

34:49.596 --> 34:53.931
Right. George, you said there
were three Klaxton brothers?

34:53.966 --> 34:57.436
- That's right sir.
- Then where's the third?

35:08.180 --> 35:11.883
Drop your weapons.

35:11.918 --> 35:15.353
Drop 'em!

35:18.590 --> 35:22.126
Liam!

35:25.263 --> 35:28.265
Walter!

35:29.800 --> 35:31.135
Walter!

35:34.773 --> 35:36.808
Damn brother fell asleep up there.

35:43.348 --> 35:45.916
Drop your gun!

35:49.120 --> 35:51.488
Woah!

35:53.724 --> 35:55.859
Go! Go!

35:58.996 --> 36:02.766
- Bloody Bat!
- Sir, he may have saved our lives.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.734
Come back here!

36:08.873 --> 36:11.841
It's alright. I managed to retrieve this.

36:35.931 --> 36:38.766
Alright, sir. Provide me with cover.

36:42.236 --> 36:44.906
Mr. Masterson!

36:44.940 --> 36:47.842
Mr. Masterson, are you alright?!

36:47.877 --> 36:50.577
Ugh... Back's been better...

37:01.990 --> 37:04.892
See if you can find
another weapon, Crabtree.

37:04.926 --> 37:08.361
Crabtree?!

37:13.134 --> 37:16.603
Well, I suppose it's a good
thing you changed professions.

37:30.851 --> 37:34.120
This way.

37:56.709 --> 37:59.378
Juvenile...

38:02.215 --> 38:04.183
- Sir!
- Murdoch!

38:04.217 --> 38:11.290
- You alright?
- Woah... back's been better.

38:11.324 --> 38:13.291
Where's Bat?

38:20.416 --> 38:23.718
Outta my way. You're not a lawman anymore.

38:23.753 --> 38:28.689
'Least I'm a man. More
than I can say for you.

38:28.723 --> 38:33.094
Shooting your partner in the back.

38:33.128 --> 38:35.796
A man would do it face to face.

38:35.831 --> 38:38.499
You ready?

38:38.533 --> 38:42.036
- Bat, no!
- I caused this!

38:42.071 --> 38:45.172
- Let me settle it.
- Don't be foolish, Bat.

38:57.018 --> 38:59.887
You killed a man.

39:07.795 --> 39:10.897
I'm not the law.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.600
They are.

39:13.634 --> 39:16.069
I'm just a sports writer.

39:16.104 --> 39:19.472
But a damn good one.

39:32.875 --> 39:36.211
Father and the Son and
the Holy Spirit. Amen.

39:36.645 --> 39:39.264
- Father Clemence.
- William.

39:39.268 --> 39:42.470
- You asked to speak with me.
- I am so pleased that you have

39:42.505 --> 39:44.672
finally found someone in this world who is

39:44.706 --> 39:47.108
at the very least your equal.

39:49.412 --> 39:51.914
Julia?

39:56.485 --> 39:58.586
You're certainly impressed Father Clemence.

39:58.620 --> 40:02.057
And he, I, William.

40:02.091 --> 40:04.926
He's permitted our wedding
to take place in the church.

40:04.960 --> 40:08.296
Julia... I know your convictions,

40:08.330 --> 40:10.865
you don't have to do that for me.

40:10.899 --> 40:13.701
And now I better
understand your convictions.

40:13.735 --> 40:16.771
Your faith is important to you William.

40:16.805 --> 40:20.942
And if we're to marry, I
want to marry all of you.

40:27.915 --> 40:29.916
Here he comes, here he comes!

40:34.922 --> 40:38.225
Hey! Hey!

40:38.259 --> 40:40.427
Congratulations, sir.

40:40.462 --> 40:42.662
- George, you shouldn't...
- Well I have,

40:42.697 --> 40:45.431
- so let's make the best of it.
- Murdoch, take a drink.

40:45.466 --> 40:48.234
- Oh, thank you sir, but...
- You're entering your final

40:48.268 --> 40:50.937
hours as a free man. Take it from me,

40:50.972 --> 40:53.673
once you're married, you learn
to appreciate the taste of it.

40:53.708 --> 40:57.243
Well, maybe just one drink.

40:57.277 --> 41:00.113
Well, if it's just going to be
one, let's make it a good one.

41:00.147 --> 41:02.548
Thank you, George.

41:02.583 --> 41:05.017
Cheers.

41:05.051 --> 41:08.454
- Oh! Ho! Ho! Ho!
- There we go!

41:08.489 --> 41:10.456
There we are!

41:10.491 --> 41:14.793
- Mrs. Kitchen, my goodness.
- All of your favourites.

41:14.828 --> 41:17.395
- Even beef stew.
- Oh! Ho! Thank you.

41:17.430 --> 41:19.498
I sure will miss you, Detective.

41:19.532 --> 41:22.567
- You'll miss me?
- Well, you certainly aren't

41:22.602 --> 41:24.837
going to bring your bride back
to live in my boarding house.

41:24.871 --> 41:26.905
Who'd entertain such foolishness?

41:26.940 --> 41:28.941
- Ha! Right...
- Murdoch, Murdoch.

41:28.975 --> 41:31.209
I've got something for you male mocker.

41:31.244 --> 41:33.678
- A... a gift?
- Well open it!

41:41.187 --> 41:43.421
Bat Masterson's pistol. The very gun

41:43.456 --> 41:46.625
- that tamed the West.
- Thank you sir, thank you.

41:46.659 --> 41:50.394
- A fine memento indeed.
- I paid a pretty penny for that.

41:50.428 --> 41:53.064
- Ah, yes.
- But... Bat sold me the gun

41:53.098 --> 41:55.533
- that tamed the West.
- Looks like you've been had, George.

41:55.567 --> 41:59.103
Well, the inspector too,
by the looks of it. Anyway,

41:59.138 --> 42:01.225
don't mention it. Best
not to ruin the evening.

42:01.239 --> 42:03.575
Thank you. What have you, George?

42:03.609 --> 42:06.412
Ah, sir. I had a gift for you...

42:08.516 --> 42:10.852
Jackson! I told Jackson
this was not about him

42:10.886 --> 42:14.355
and his bloody trumpet. Jackson! Jackson!

42:27.034 --> 42:29.069
Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh my!

42:34.943 --> 42:38.945
Well, I... suppose I'd better be going.

42:38.980 --> 42:41.514
Enjoy yourself, Detective Murdoch.

42:41.548 --> 42:44.717
Breakfast will be ready at 6, as usual.

42:58.699 --> 43:00.700
With utmost admiration,

43:00.734 --> 43:04.203
